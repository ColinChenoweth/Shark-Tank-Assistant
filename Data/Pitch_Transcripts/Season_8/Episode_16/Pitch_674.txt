My name is Evan Delahanty
coming to you from Akron, Ohio.
I'm the founder
of Peaceful Fruits,
and I'm here to ask
for 75,000 of your dollars
in return for 20% of my company.
That's because I know
that together,
we can make
fruit snacks great again.
So what makes
our fruit snacks so great?
Well, first, they're actually
made from fruit.
And not just any fruit,
we use the most popular
super fruit in the world ??
acai.
It's our main ingredient.
We take
those beautiful whole fruits.
We run them through
our all?natural,
trade?secret production process.
What you get is food
that you can feel good about.
And that's the other thing
that really sets us apart.
I started Peaceful Fruits
after two years
in the Amazon Rainforest
as a Peace Corps volunteer.
We partner with the local people
to harvest the acai
and empower them
to protect their rainforest,
to protect their way of life
from the threat of extinction.
And now people are responding
to our snacks and to that story
'cause you've seen it happen
with organic produce ??
fair?trade coffee,
now ethical chocolate.
I'm ready to do
the same thing for fruit snacks.
Who's ready to take a bite?
?Let's go.
?Let's try it.
?Yeah, let's try it.
?Bring on the "osutite."
?What is "osutite"?
?[ Laughs ]
?There you go, sir.
Which one is the acai?a?
So acai is how you pronounce it,
just to be...
?Exactly, Robert.
?Ah?sigh?ee.
And both of these ??
We have two flavors ??
the acai pineapple
and the acai apple.
Both of which are there
for you guys to enjoy.
?Where do you manufacture this?
?This is good.
I prefer "best ever,"
but I'll take "good," you know?
[ Chuckles ]
So the way
that we produce it ??
We work with folks
with disabilities
in an industrial kitchen
there in Akron.
They're able to follow
exactly what I need
because
they're so carefully managed.
Our process
is totally all?natural.
So we don't need
any of the weird mad science.
We don't need
any of the additives.
It's literally just the fruit.
You're not the only one
doing fruit
or snacks based off of acai.
There's a lot of people.
There are,
but we're the only one
that actually uses it
as the main ingredient.
The acai is a very healthy
thing to eat.
It is.
It's known as a super food
because it's one of the best
sources of antioxidants,
which have been linked to cancer
prevention and anti?aging.
Let me just clear
the field.
I have an investment
in a fruit?snack company.
I was listening to see
if there's a synergy somehow.
Mm?hmm.
I see it as
a competitive product.
I'm already in that space.
I'm out.
You said that you were
in the Peace Corps.
Can you share with us
that background, that story?
I?I'd love
to tell you about that.
So ?? Actually,
we have some photos, so...
I was there in Suriname,
which is a little country
just northeast of Brazil,
and these people are subsisting
on less than a few dollars
a day.
And that's what makes
this product
really great
from a social perspective.
Evan, you are
one impressive dude.
I got to tell you.
Well,
I appreciate you saying it.
Yeah. Wow, that's ??
But you already said you're out.
[ Laughter ]
I did.
It hurts.
It hurts.
?Let's talk about the numbers.
?Uh, what are your costs?
So I sell it wholesale
for 85 cents,
and then it retails
for $1.25 to $1.50,
which is very much in range
with our competitors.
?How much have you sold?
?About $20,000 total.
?Dollars, not units.
?Yes, yes.
?Okay.
?Do you have a retailer
that said they'll take this on
and give you shelf space?
Yeah, actually.
So we just got approved
by Whole Foods,
and we're gonna be
launching with them shortly.
?In the Ohio region?
?Just in the Ohio area.
They're gonna give us actually
a couple different locations
in the store.
?Yeah.
?We're also about to launch
with Giant Eagle
Market District.
It's got to sell itself,
right?
Uh, it ?? it does
for the most part,
but obviously, starting out,
we are 100% committed to demos.
I'm gonna live
in that Whole Foods store.
We're hustling to get this done.
I mean, you know,
it's hard to get the name out.
And you look at every year,
you know,
America finds a new super food,
which ?? they all exist, right?
So whether it's kombucha
or now kale salad or ??
I think acai's had some staying
power, fortunately, yeah.
?Or pomegranate. Right?
?Sure enough.
I think it's just
a big challenge,
?So true, Evan.
?But ?? But if we don't
figure out how to take care
of our communities
at the same time,
we're gonna lose
places to spend that money.
Not just that, but
it's communicating that story.
Evan, I love the story, but
we're back in America now, okay?
We are.
You know, your deal ??
$75,000 for 20% is not crazy,
but it's not enough money
to roll this puppy out.
Well, I'm happy to think bigger
if you want to ??
want to make an offer.
I say respectfully not for me.
I'm out.
Well,
I appreciate you saying that.
Thank you very much.
Evan, you are
a great entrepreneur.
Thank you for saying so.
The only problem here is
your competition in the arena
is huge.
There's a million
fruit snacks out there ??
strips, rolls, bites.
I think you're fantastic
and super?smart,
and you're gonna make it.
For me, the investment ??
the fruit snack ??
isn't the right one.
I'm out...
but I have no doubt
that you're going to make
quite something
of yourself.
Well, I appreciate the thoughts
from all of you guys.
?Evan, thank you very much.
?I really ??
?Good luck, Evan.
?Thank you, Evan.
?Good luck.
?Thank you.
We didn't get that deal,
