Hi, Sharks.
I'm Niki Rasor.
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Matt Rasor.
My company is called
Fire Fighter Turn?Out Bags,
One day Matt came home
with his turnout coat,
and he asked me
to remove that pocket.
So I plucked it off,
and I made a cool,
little bag out of it ??
this one.
[ Chuckles ]
?[ Chuckles ]
?Once I took it out,
I'd get stopped
wherever I went
Niki and Matt
are seeking $250,000
for 33% of their company
Fire Fighter Turn?Out Bags,
but Robert has offered
to buy out the entire company.
I'll buy the entire company
for $500,000.
Lock, stock, and barrel.
[ Crying ]
Ooh!
I'm just curious.
Why are you crying?
I just...
Overwhelmed?
Can I...?
It's okay.
Is it ??
Is it the heels?
[ Laughter ]
Niki, I've never loved
a business so much on here...
Ohh!
...that I've wanted
to buy the whole thing.
I just love it.
I love everything about it.
?You know what...?
What do you think?
I could never disappoint
the people
that I'm serving right now.
[ Exhales sharply ]
And all of you are right.
I...
Listen, I'm not sure
what you're going to say,
but I don't think
you've disappointed anybody.
Yeah, I...
I think you came up
with a fabulous idea.
Thank you.
I have a ton of admiration
for firemen, policemen,
people that risk their lives
every day to help all of us.
And not only
is it just something
that I feel passionately about,
but you have
a great sense of style.
Thank you.
Then there's the flip side
that happens
to so many entrepreneurs,
where people knock off
a great idea.
Right.
And they cut the prices,
and you're mad because
you're the designer.
Why shouldn't you be able
to make that, too?
Thank you.
I actually think
there's a market for both.
?There is.
?But the cool thing
that people would want
to really love and buy into
is that we could then donate
money to firemen's funds.
Right.
So that a certain percentage
of every bag sold
goes to firemen's charities.
Right.
I'd like to make you an offer.
Okay.
I would give you $250,000 for...
I'm gonna go 50?50 partner,
and I'll tell you why ??
because I'd like you
to be the designer,
but then I know me and my team
would need to take over
the manufacturing,
the charity donation, the books.
[ Sighs ]
So I'd like to be
your equal partner.
You realize both the offers
are the same valuation.
In the case of Robert,
he's paying you
twice as much for 100%.
Lori wants to be
a 50?50 partner.
