so Ellie's dad might say,
"Tell Mr. Wonderful that
vampires don't need sleep,
but Ellie does."

Our hardware
is completely interchangeable.
That means you can pop it out
Hey, Ellie, thanks.
Yep.
[ Laughs ]
I love the laugh.
It's really cute.
O'Leary: So, does this use
the home's wireless
to actually communicate
with the app?
How come mine's
still talking?
Exactly.
So, it's all WiFi?based.
That means that you don't
have to have a phone
or a laptop nearby
to use it.
Gauri,
you're the real deal.
I mean,
very impressive.
Here's my challenge
with it.
You're willing
to sell 2.5%.
It's too small
an equity stake for me.
I ?? I'm not
interested in that.
I wish you the best.
I'm out.
So, when you made
your presentation
Gauri has one offer on the table
from Chris Sacca for Toymail,
Gauri, let me ??
Is that a yes, Gauri?
Two offers,
you've got two offers.
Um...
Gauri, did Mark not offer you
the exact same?
Thank you.
Congrats, Gauri.
