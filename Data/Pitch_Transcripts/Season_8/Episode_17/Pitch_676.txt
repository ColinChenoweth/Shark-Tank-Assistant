Hi, my name's Ryan Woltz.
I'm from Denver, Colorado.
I'm the founder of Edn,
So, Ryan,
do I have to use your pods,
or can I just
put my own seeds
into this little
plastic thing again?
Yeah, so our goal is to have
a great user experience,
so you can use our pods.
They're gonna be delivered.
It's extremely simple
to operate,
but if you want to plant
your own seeds, you can.
How would you say you're
different from AeroGardens?
So, for one, we have
an absolutely beautiful design,
but we also have
intelligence.
So the idea is that
while this is operating,
we can perfect the growth
of different types of plants.
So, that's kind of the power
of the Edn operating system.
How much
do the pods cost, Ryan?
The pods ??
so $12 subscription per month,
Ryan,
do I buy this online?
Yeah, so right now,
we sell direct to consumer.
Ryan, you need somebody
on this journey
Ryan, I'm in the same ballpark
as Robert.
Really appreciate it, Mark.
Thank you.
Thank you, Ryan.
This becomes
so technological.
I worry if it takes a lot
of the soul out of the process,
I'll tell you where
I'm at with it, Ryan.
Um, I'm intrigued.
I can help you
get this into retail ??
the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond,
the Target, the Walmarts,
but this price point isn't
gonna work for those guys.
It's gonna have to be
a different price point.
Maybe a more
dumbed?down product.
I'll do the deal
$150,000 for 15%.
Well, Ryan ??
Greiner:
I have another question.
I never get to grow things.
I'm always traveling.
Woltz: Right.
So if you said that I could
be gone for weeks at a time
Ryan, I don't want
to listen to Lori anymore.
So what if I'm gone
for a month?
I made you an offer.
You have
to make a decision.
I'll do the deal
I just gave you.
Herjavec: Ooh.
Well, let me ?? let me
just finish.
I don't want to li??
I don't want to compete.
I want to hear.
?Ryan, Ryan, Ryan.
?It's beautiful ?? wait.
There's an offer of 15% ??
Not anymore.
Wait, wait.
It's beautiful ??
Lori poisoned your deal.
The reason why is because I need
to take over manufacturing...
Okay.
...so that you can get
this cost way down.
Because you want
to blow these out.
Right.
You want these
in every home.
Right.
You want people
to be able to afford it.
Right.
Ryan, you know what I think
the most important thing is ??
getting a deal!
Yes, hey, I ?? I agree.
I just want
to hear everybody out.
Greiner: It is important
getting a deal.
Good for you, Ryan.
That's an expensive
walk down the hallway.
Ryan, the lesson here
is when you get an offer
that you're willing to take,
take it.
You didn't close.
?Thank you.
Hey, appreciate it.
Thank y'all so much
for your time.
Good luck.
If I could turn back the clock,
I would have accepted his deal,
