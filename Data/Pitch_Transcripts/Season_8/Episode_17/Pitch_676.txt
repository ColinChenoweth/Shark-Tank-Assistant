My name is Gauri Nanda
and I'm from New York City.
My parents came from India
and immigrated
to the United States
with just $10 in their pockets.
They tried their hands
at several businesses,
eventually taking over
a failing newspaper,
and they built it up to success
and ended up selling it
for a profit in 2007.
I went to MIT for grad school,
and it was there that I created
a product for a class project,
and it became a runaway success.
Nanda: I spent many years
building that company,
but eventually I wanted to do
something
a little bit more meaningful,
and that's when I started
my new company.
You guys are
our first product testers.
10 years ago,
I created a product
that went viral overnight.
Now, that doesn't happen twice
very often.
These are the thoughts
that keep me up at night,
and I wonder
if I can do it again.
I followed
in my parents' footsteps
and became an entrepreneur
myself.
I admire their story, and now
I want them to see me succeed.
This is an entirely new market
we're trying to create,
and if I don't get a deal
from the Sharks,
it'll be very difficult
to make that happen.
Hi, guys.
My name is Gauri Nanda,
and this is my friend Ellie,
who's gonna
be helping me out today.
I am the co?founder of Toymail
out of New York City,
and I'm seeking $250,000
for 2.5% of my company.
Whew.
Sharks, Toymail is all about
bringing families together,
especially when they're apart.
We want
to connect parents to kids
in the simplest way possible.
And we're not doing it
by giving your kids a phone.
We're doing it with the talkies.
Now, with the talkies,
kids as young as 3 can,
for the first time in their
lives, send a voice message,
and they don't need a phone.
They just push a button
on the back of their toy,
and that message is
immediately sent to a loved one.
Hi, Dad.
Mr. Wonderful
says it's fine
if I stay up all night
watching "Shark Tank" reruns.
Love you.
Bye.
[ Laughs ]
That message goes
to parent?approved contacts.
So, parents can listen
to that message
directly with the Toymail app.
Nanda: And they can
use the app to respond,
so Ellie's dad might say,
"Tell Mr. Wonderful that
vampires don't need sleep,
but Ellie does."
[ Chuckles ]
Our hardware
is completely interchangeable.
That means you can pop it out
and put it
into a new animal skin
as your child's
interests change.
Wow.
Talkies also respond
to physical play.
[ Chuckles ]
Talkies
are completely expandable.
That means parents
can unlock new features,
educational content,
or games or stories or songs.
Sharks, I hope you'll join us in
connecting families everywhere.
And, Ellie, if you would please
pass out some sharks
for our Sharks.
Hey, Ellie, thanks.
Yep.
[ Laughs ]
I love the laugh.
It's really cute.
O'Leary: So, does this use
the home's wireless
to actually communicate
with the app?
How come mine's
still talking?
Exactly.
So, it's all WiFi?based.
That means that you don't
have to have a phone
or a laptop nearby
to use it.
...in front
of another screen.
Security's a concern.
It's obviously
not child?proof,
because Lori is
driving me nuts over there.
[ Laughter ]
O'Leary: Okay.
Continue.
So, Verizon is actually
one of our investors.
And they don't have a device
to sell kids under 10.
This is a huge untapped market
for that segment.
Another one of our opportunities
is with Amazon,
so Amazon is a big investor
in our company.
Amazon actually ??
they were very interested
in working with us
to bring their
Echo voice?control
technology to our toys.
And what that means is that
every single one of our toys
is going to turn
into an Echo machine for kids.
Herjavec: So how much
have you raised?
They gave us
half a million dollars.
At what valuation
did they do that?
At a $10 million cap.
How much money
have you raised total?
So, we have raised to date
$1.6 million...
Ooh.
...on that $10 million cap.
All in that
$10 million cap?
Yes.
That's a really
high price
for your very first
round of financing.
What will this
retail for?
So, we're doing it
at a retail of $50 MSRP.
What does it cost you
to manufacture it?
So, our cost of goods
is $20,
so it's great margins
for e?commerce retail.
We'll be ?? actually be bringing
down those costs of goods.
That's not gonna work
in retail.
So, yes, we'll be bringing down
our cost of goods,
it looks like $10
in the next year as we scale.
What's your background?
I have kind of
a unique background.
10 years ago,
I was a student at MIT.
And I could never get myself
out of bed in the morning,
so what I did
is I created this alarm clock,
this funny little thing
called Clocky
that would jump off
your nightstand
and then run around your room,
kind of forcing you
out of bed in the morning.
[ Laughter ]
So, that product
went viral.
I was able to bootstrap it
to $10 million in sales.
[ Laughs ]
Is it part
of this deal?
No, Toymail
is a separate entity.
Good for you.
But we believe Toymail
is way bigger.
Gauri,
you're the real deal.
I mean,
very impressive.
Here's my challenge
with it.
You're willing
to sell 2.5%.
It's too small
an equity stake for me.
I ?? I'm not
interested in that.
I wish you the best.
I'm out.
So, when you made
your presentation
or your discussions
with Verizon and Amazon,
what did you project out
three years and five years
from now, top line?
So, next year, we project to do
over $2.5 million in sales.
From there, we're scaling up
to $12 million in sales.
Could you see this being
a $100 million revenue company?
That's absolutely
the way we look at this.
O'Leary:
So, look, having seen dozens
of iterations of plush toys,
I'm impressed.
I really am.
But it leaves nothing.
I mean, I would need
five Clockys
to get out of bed
for 2.5%.
[ Laughs ]
I got ?? it's just ?? it
doesn't even get me interested.
I'm out.
Look, I like just about
everything about this business.
You made $10 million
from your dorm room.
I think you're uniquely
qualified to take this on.
The part I don't like about it
is this valuation.
I think for something this early
without a ton of sales yet,
it's hard right off the bat
to come out at 10 million bucks.
And so, with all that said,
I do want to make you an offer.
Okay.
I want to give you $400,000
for 5% of the company.
Um, that's
a very generous offer.
Thank you, Chris.
It's definitely an offer
I'd love to consider.
Of course,
I want to get the best offer
for ?? for my company.
Well, look,
I'm very confident
in my offer,
so I invite you
to shop mine around,
'cause I know
it's gonna hold out.
Maybe not.
Gauri has one offer on the table
from Chris Sacca for Toymail,
a toy enabling kids
to send and receive voicemails.
But Mark Cuban
may be interested.
So, what I'll do is
I'll offer you $500,000 for 5%,
but I'd like to ask
for some real estate,
because I don't have
a specific need right now,
but at some point
over the next couple years,
if there's
children's content
or relevant content
that I come through,
because I have over
a billion dollars
in content assets ??
whether it's movies, teams,
whatever it may be.
Mm?hmm.
There's a significant value
there.
That's ?? That's
wonderful.
I mean, we would love
to have your expertise
as well as, of course,
your content would be amazing
to build up this platform.
Gauri, let me ??
Is that a yes, Gauri?
Two offers,
you've got two offers.
Gauri, is that a yes?
And then there's me.
?I?I?I...
?Let's talk.
?Wait!
?Wait a minute.
There's still me.
[ Nanda chuckles ]
I do want to have ??
let Lori speak,
but that's
a very generous offer.
Thank you.
I'm sure you came in here
with thoughts
of what different Sharks
could do for you.
Lori, you've made
tons of investments
in hardware companies,
and I know you're instrumental
with distribution.
How can I do something
where it's not gonna
take me forever and
ever and ever and ever
to see
the fruits of my labors?
What would you say to me
is a deal
that you think
we together...
Mm?hmm.
...could be
excited about?
You want <i>her</i>
to make you an offer?
?Yeah, I do.
?Wow.
I want to hear
what she would say,
'cause she has two ??
Negotiate
against yourself.
Um...
Gauri, did Mark not offer you
the exact same?
And I'm not gonna stay here
forever, Gauri.
I really appreciate Mark's deal,
and, of course, if you want ??
you know, if you could come in
with Mark on that deal,
of course two Sharks
are better than one.
Here's what
I would say.
Um...
Is I do actually think
Lori has a unique skill set
for a deal like this.
Right.
And I do have
a lot of respect
for her deep understanding
of marketing.
Mark, on the other hand,
if he had a new idea,
it would die
of loneliness.
And so I don't see what
he brings to the table.
[ Laughter ]
Oh, whatever.
So here's what
I would like to propose.
I would give you 600K
for 5% of the company,
as well as the option to put up
to an additional million dollars
in the next round.
Just increased your value
by 20%.
You're up
to $12 million now.
I did. I did.
Lori is invited to come in
and take any part of that deal
that she wants to take,
large or small.
But what percentage
would I get?
You can put in any fraction
of the $600,000
and get the related percentage
of the company...
At the same value
of $12 million.
... at the same value
that I'm paying.
And she probably wants
two Sharks over one.
And so if you wanted to come in
at 300K and split it with me,
you'd get 2.5%
of the company.
What if I put in $200,000
for the 2.5%?
No, no, you and I aren't gonna
pay different prices, Lori.
[ Laughs ]
Yeah.
Basically,
it devalues me.
You would end up getting
a cheaper price than I do.
Well, because I'm gonna be
a workhorse out there.
Are you willing to take the deal
Chris has on the table
without Lori?
I am willing to do that deal.
You don't have
a choice, Lori.
She's gonna do the deal alone
with Chris.
All right.
I'll go in with Chris.
Lori, I ??
For how much?
For how much?
I'll do it for $300,000
for 2.5%.
We got a deal?
We've got a deal.
?Right on.
?Thank you, guys.
Okay.
Congratulations.
Great. Really wanted
to do a deal with you.
You did it smart.
Oh, thank you.
Whoo!
Thank you guys so much.
?Yeah, nice job.
Thank you.
Congrats, Gauri.
