Hello, Sharks.
My name is Yannis Moati.
I'm the CEO
of Hotels by Day.
Herjavec:
Yannis, hang on a sec.
There's
a technical reason
why the other people
can't offer this
on a block?hour rate?
Yeah.
I'm dying to hear this.
Why?
Most hotel?property?management
systems
Dass:
We're actually connecting
to what is called
a channel?management system
that actually connects
With the workaround technology
that Brian has created ??
Well, what <i>is</i>
that techno??
Like, is it actual technology
or is just a hack?
Yes, it's technology ??
I'll tell you why ??
because we're connecting
to a channel manager.
So instead of going
through the CRS,
we're connecting
to a channel manager,
going straight
into the hotel.
Dass: Thank you.
Thank you.
?Good luck.
?Thanks, bye.
Thanks.
Sacca: There's nothing
more frustrating
than asking questions
about somebody's tech stack
Moati: The Sharks did not see
the opportunity today.
They gave us
absolutely no time
nor a chance to explain
how we do business,
