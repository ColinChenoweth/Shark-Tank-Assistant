Hi, my name's Ryan Woltz.
I'm from Denver, Colorado.
I'm the founder of Edn,
and I'm seeking $150,000
for a 10% stake in my company.
At Edn, we're on a mission to
paint the concrete jungle green
and to change the way
the world grows plants.
Growing is hard.
It requires time, expertise,
and attention.
And even if
you do everything right,
you can still kill your plants.
Take it from me ?? I know.
I used to be
a plant serial killer.
So I set out to design a product
for people like me,
who love to be around nature,
but who just aren't very good
at the nurture part.
The Edn wall garden
is an intelligent indoor garden
that takes the guesswork
out of growing
and ensures perfect results.
Our software
automates everything.
We control the lighting,
the watering,
and the plant food,
so you can have fresh herbs,
vegetables, and even flowers
all year round
right in the comfort
of your own home.
Our app guides you
through the entire process.
There's no dirt, so you just
add water, plant food,
drop in your seed pods,
and our technology
takes care of the rest.
The wall garden's designed
to be an engaging experience
that breathes life
into your home
and makes gardening fun again
for the entire family.
I'd like to hand out
some samples of our seed pods
and then dive
into some questions.
Okay.
So, I got you each
a seed pod.
All right.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Greiner: Thank you.
Appreciate that.
Thank you, Kevin.
Anything for you,
Robert.
?Thank you, sir.
?Not a problem.
So, Ryan,
do I have to use your pods,
or can I just
put my own seeds
into this little
plastic thing again?
Yeah, so our goal is to have
a great user experience,
so you can use our pods.
They're gonna be delivered.
It's extremely simple
to operate,
but if you want to plant
your own seeds, you can.
How would you say you're
different from AeroGardens?
So, for one, we have
an absolutely beautiful design,
but we also have
intelligence.
So the idea is that
while this is operating,
we can perfect the growth
of different types of plants.
So, that's kind of the power
of the Edn operating system.
And how much
does it cost?
So, the cost is $499
for the large unit,
and then the small unit
is $99,
which I call that
the gateway garden.
How much
do the pods cost, Ryan?
The pods ??
so $12 subscription per month,
and we've got
an 82% margin on those.
So the subscription service
is to kind of continually
bring in new plants.
Do I have to buy
the subscription service?
You do not, no.
Do you get to choose
what your plants are?
?You do, yes.
?Okay.
Ryan,
do I buy this online?
Yeah, so right now,
we sell direct to consumer.
And then in the future,
when we get our prices down,
we want to go
big?box retail.
Just this last winter,
we ran a campaign
where we did
$10,000 worth of sales
in just five days.
I was actually online
this summer
looking at
alternative products
just to grow cilantro
[chilantro]
'cause I like to have
fresh cilantro.
That's one
of my shticks.
?Did you say "chilantro"?
?Cilantro.
Whatever.
I ?? I like it.
Cilantro.
And there was
tons and tons
of consumer,
small?based hydroponic labs.
Right.
What you're adding to the story
is the design feel,
but I saw stuff
as cheap as 40 bucks.
I think what differentiates us
is the design, of course,
but then also the technology.
The name Edn actually stands for
"Environmental Data Network."
And the vision of Edn
is to perfect the growth
of any type of plant.
Ryan, you need somebody
on this journey
that enjoys plants and shares
in this passion with you.
Yeah.
It's just not my thing.
I'm out.
Well, I appreciate it,
nonetheless.
?Yep.
?Thank you.
Ryan, I'm in the same ballpark
as Robert.
I tried to grow a cactus,
and it lasted about a day.
It's just ?? it's not an area
I have a feel for, so I'm out.
Really appreciate it, Mark.
Thank you.
Thank you, Ryan.
This becomes
so technological.
I worry if it takes a lot
of the soul out of the process,
and I ?? that's a weird thing
to hear from the technology guy.
One of the first things I say
is "Where's your app?
What's your
app strategy?"
Right.
And this is one
of those companies
where I ask,
"Why the app?"
Right.
I actually don't think
it's that necessary.
Right.
I think there's
a niche business
for people who are
geeking out over the data,
but I don't think that's
that's gonna help you sell
hundreds of thousands
of these.
I'm out.
Appreciate it, Chris.
I'll tell you where
I'm at with it, Ryan.
Um, I'm intrigued.
I can help you
get this into retail ??
the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond,
the Target, the Walmarts,
but this price point isn't
gonna work for those guys.
It's gonna have to be
a different price point.
Maybe a more
dumbed?down product.
I'll do the deal
$150,000 for 15%.
You know, I understand it's more
than you wanted to give up...
Wow.
...but I'm so valuable
it's ridiculous.
That's shocking.
That's actually
a really good offer.
Yeah.
What is the light
doing to you?
No, I just ?? I think it's ??
I'm intrigued, I'm intrigued.
And I can definitely help you
in distribution.
Well, Ryan ??
Greiner:
I have another question.
I never get to grow things.
I'm always traveling.
Woltz: Right.
So if you said that I could
be gone for weeks at a time
and that the light would stay on
and it would stay watered
and I wouldn't come home
and everything's dead,
because of your technology,
because of my app.
Right.
Is that the case?
Yeah,
so that's the case.
It's made for people who travel,
people who ??
Ryan, I don't want
to listen to Lori anymore.
So what if I'm gone
for a month?
I made you an offer.
You have
to make a decision.
I'll do the deal
I just gave you.
Herjavec: Ooh.
Well, let me ?? let me
just finish.
I don't want to li??
I don't want to compete.
I want to hear.
And I'll tell you
what's gonna happen.
If she drops out,
it's going up to 25%.
I'm gonna
make you an offer,
but I'm gonna do
a conditional offer.
?Okay.
?Okay?
$150,000 for 25%.
[ Laughs ]
But I'm gonna
tell you why.
Because I think ??
No, no, I'm now at 25%.
That's official.
?Ryan, Ryan, Ryan.
?It's beautiful ?? wait.
There's an offer of 15% ??
Not anymore.
Wait, wait.
It's beautiful ??
Lori poisoned your deal.
The reason why is because I need
to take over manufacturing...
Okay.
...so that you can get
this cost way down.
Because you want
to blow these out.
Right.
You want these
in every home.
Right.
You want people
to be able to afford it.
Right.
And at $500,
it's not affordable.
But I think we could probably
get it slashed in half.
Isn't that
what you said, Kevin?
And that's
what's important.
That's exactly
what I said.
Ryan, you know what I think
the most important thing is ??
getting a deal!
Yes, hey, I ?? I agree.
I just want
to hear everybody out.
Greiner: It is important
getting a deal.
And just so we're clear, Ryan,
I have no contingencies.
Of course
I want the price down.
I will help you there,
but it's not a contingency.
So, Kevin ??
My offer
is $150,000 for 25%.
Unfortunately, I had
to pay a terrible price
on listening to her.
Ooh.
So we have the same offer,
essentially, on the table.
Without a contingency,
in my case.
But I think my contingency's
a good one.
I don't think so.
Why take risks?
Why take risks?
It's only gonna help you.
It's only gonna help you.
So I guess my question is,
Kevin, do you have experience
with manufacturing?
?Yes.
?Kevin does not.
Yes, I do!
Okay, so you know I've done
over 600 products.
We <i>all</i>
manufacture overseas.
I would say
35% of my portfolio ??
Do you know who has
the number?one
electronic?component product
out of "Shark Tank"
right now?
It's called IllumiBowl,
it's manufactured in China.
Oh, my God.
He's so ridiculous.
Number two,
I make more Christmas lights
than anybody else
in China.
Kevin, are you willing
to go down back to 15%?
No way.
If you're willing to go back,
I'll make a deal now.
[ Scoffs ] Kevin.
Why didn't you take the deal
when you had it?
Because, you know, I wanted ??
I wanted to hear Lori out.
O'Leary: I work with a lot
of entrepreneurs.
Yeah.
You've got to bond right away.
Bird?in?hand theory.
I think you have
to make a decision
between the two of us.
Kevin,
I'm willing to go with you
if you can drop down
to 20%.
No.
I'm out.
?Oh.
?Lesson learned.
All right. Well, I, you know,
very much appreciate it,
but for the vision that I want
to create for this company,
I know it's gonna require
additional capital.
And so to get there,
it just doesn't make sense to me
right now
from a valuation standpoint.
Good for you, Ryan.
That's an expensive
walk down the hallway.
Ryan, the lesson here
is when you get an offer
that you're willing to take,
take it.
You didn't close.
?Thank you.
Hey, appreciate it.
Thank y'all so much
for your time.
Good luck.
If I could turn back the clock,
I would have accepted his deal,
but, you know, I can't do that,
and he stuck with it.
You know, I respect that,
and, you know, lesson learned.
Well, you taught that young man
a valuable lesson.
Let that be a lesson, Robert.
Don't mess with me.
