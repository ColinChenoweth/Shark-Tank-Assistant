Hello, Sharks.
My name is Yannis Moati.
I'm the CEO
of Hotels by Day.
And I'm Brian Dass,
CTO of Hotels by Day.
We're here today
seeking $750,000
in exchange for 10%
of our company.
Sharks, our company is
reinventing the hotel stay.
How many times have you
or someone you know
traveled to a city
just for the day?
You get into the city
at 8:00 A. M.,
and you have a meeting
at 1:00 P. M.
What do you do
with those hours in between?
There is a massive gap
in the market,
and that is why we've created
Hotels by Day.
Jimmy...
Together: Roll the tape!
Hotels by Day,
through our app and our website,
allows customers
to book a day room.
You arrive early at your hotel,
you check in early,
you relax in your room,
you order some room service,
refresh, own your meeting,
and close the sale.
Our model is a paradigm shift
in the hospitality industry.
It generates revenue
for hotels.
It gives guests
flexibility.
And it closes the loop
on the customer journey.
So, Sharks, who's ready to check
in early with Hotels by Day?
Why does it feel like
a "Saturday Night Live" skit?
[ Laughter ]
How does it work?
Tell me the pricing.
So, on average,
it's six hours
that are being provided
by the hotel at $90.
O'Leary: I have one question
that could settle this
in either a great way
or it could end badly
right here.
Please, go ahead.
Why in the world
wouldn't all the other sites
that already exist in a really
cluttered, competitive space
simply add this feature?
Sure.
Well,
technology right now
doesn't allow any of the majors
to go into the space.
Herjavec:
Yannis, hang on a sec.
There's
a technical reason
why the other people
can't offer this
on a block?hour rate?
Yeah.
I'm dying to hear this.
Why?
Most hotel?property?management
systems
cannot handle
a day?room booking.
?It does not work like that.
?Let me ask you a question.
But they charge late?check?in
rates all the time,
unless you're able
to negotiate out of it.
Let's use a chain name ??
a Marriott ??
I say, "Look, I'm not
checking in until 4:00."
"I'm sorry, there's
an extra $80 charge there."
You just mentioned that
there's an analogue process ??
you calling the hotel,
you e?mailing the hotel.
Sacca: Before we
move on, just ??
So how have you solved
that technology problem
with your own
outside technology?
Dass:
We're actually connecting
to what is called
a channel?management system
that actually connects
to the availability, rates,
and inventory.
So there is a way that we're
connecting to get the rates
to be able to set the rates up
to the half?a?day room.
Cuban: So how are
you blocking out ??
Wait, how ??
Can I step back?
It doesn't ?? wait.
Can I step back?
The central reservation system
does not take in day bookings.
It's 30?year?old
technology.
Any booking that goes
into the CRS,
the central
reservation system,
is factored in
as a night stay.
?No, I accept that.
?So wait.
You're not doing a ??
so, look,
you're not doing a great job
of explaining it.
If their internal technology
can't do it,
how does your
external technology...
All right.
...fix or supplant
or override or bypass
their internal
technology?
Chris.
Let me tell you.
We are taking a fraction
of their inventory
that is sitting empty
between 9:00 and 6:00,
and we are selling it
to the customers.
With the workaround technology
that Brian has created ??
Well, what <i>is</i>
that techno??
Like, is it actual technology
or is just a hack?
Yes, it's technology ??
I'll tell you why ??
because we're connecting
to a channel manager.
So instead of going
through the CRS,
we're connecting
to a channel manager,
going straight
into the hotel.
And that is something that
we are provisionally patented.
Herjavec: How can that
be proprietary?
Let's say Kevin's
one of the other travel sites.
He hires a CTO
that can develop any ??
He didn't write
the software.
Anyone can duplicate
technology.
It's not a barrier drain.
It's a hack.
It's just
the first?to?market advantage.
Right.
How many hours
have you rented?
What's your margin?
How many customers do you have?
Et cetera, et cetera?
We are at 6,500 bookings.
All of the year of 2015,
we generated about $127,000
in gross booking revenue,
of which we're taking 14%,
all right?
That's all?
That's our cut, yes.
It's low.
Wow.
But it's ??
But it's reasonable.
It's a starting point.
Do you have a deal
with big hotel chains?
Yes.
We have signed every single
brand out there individually ??
300 properties.
But get back to ?? why don't
the big guys crush you
like the cockroaches
you are?
As I said before,
they cannot connect right now.
They will not
waste their time.
Kevin,
they'll be wasting more time
to try to connect
to a CRS that does not work.
What you're doing is
you're selling
somebody else's product,
and you're telling us
they're incapable of selling it
and that you have
some hack to get to it.
But you've done a really
poor job of explaining
why that hack is so hard to make
or why it's defensible
or why it's proprietary
to you at all.
Well ??
And so don't be shocked
that there's a lot of doubt
on this side of the room.
First of all, the hotel
can't sell day rooms.
They have not created
a system behind it.
And two, the technology
and the protocol,
they are missing.
It takes time,
it takes investment.
Guys, I do think it's a problem
you're trying to solve.
That said, every time
I tried to ask you
what technological, defensible,
proprietary approach
do you have here,
I couldn't get a straight answer
back from you guys.
I don't actually think
there is something there.
But we've also filed
several patents.
It feels like
a cobbled?together hack, like ??
No,
but before you go on ??
But, sure, go ahead.
We've had conversations
at the majors.
They think it's really
interesting what ??
They think it's
really interesting,
but those conversations
haven't ended up in a sale
'cause you don't have
anything to buy.
Your competition isn't
the big hotel chains.
It's the software layer that
already rides on top of that.
If you came in here
and told me
you were reinventing
the entire management system
the way OpenTable reinvented
the booking platform
for a restaurant,
I'd be interested,
but you're not.
The quickest way to double
your money in this deal
is to fold it over,
put it in your back pocket.
I'm out.
Ouch.
Herjavec: Wow.
Just so you know,
up to last May,
we've generated $300,000,
so the model is accelerating
20% month?to?month growth.
Yeah, because you're working
with tiny numbers, though ??
that's why.
The challenge is
how big can it be.
Just to give you
an idea,
we've seen how many people
log into our site from New York
that converts into a day stay
in New York ?? it's 8%.
If we were to run 8%
throughout the top cities
of visitors
into our website,
we'll be already
at 12,000 bookings.
Let's say you do that,
right?
You get
the 12,000 bookings.
Yeah, easy.
Easy.
That's $200,000
gross revenue.
That's $28,000 a month.
That's not enough.
I'm out.
Well, all right.
Thank you.
Guys, it's a great idea.
Mm?hmm, thank you.
I do this all the time
when I travel.
I show up
at 8:00 in the morning.
We always have to book
two nights of hotel rooms.
There's no question
that there is a market there.
But I just think that
you're a proof of concept
for one
of the bigger players.
If you prove the market,
they'll do it.
There's nothing proprietary
that you have.
I'm out.
Uh, thank you,
Robert.
Thank you.
I?I'd like
to reassure you
that the majors
won't play this game.
They cannot
get into it.
Never build the strategy
on the stupidity
of your competitors.
If there's a market there,
and you prove the market...
No, that is not
the strategy.
...they're gonna do it.
The strategy
is for us to grow it.
Either way, I'm out.
Mark's out.
Chris is out.
Kevin and Lori are still in.
Well, let me tell you
what I think.
I see your product
as like a big puzzle.
And there's so many missing
pieces for me that I'm out.
If I thought that there was
a cockroach strategy ??
and there's nothing wrong
with being a roach,
be the best roach
you can be ??
at the end of the day,
if you can survive
because nobody else wants
your tiny market, that's great.
It's true.
But that's not
what you said.
$750,000 ??
if you had made this
maybe $150,000, $250,000,
I'd ride with the roaches
for a while, figure it out.
I like the space actually,
but I can't do that.
You've made it impossible
to invest.
I'm out.
Thank you, Kevin.
Thank you so much
for your time.
Dass: Thank you.
Thank you.
?Good luck.
?Thanks, bye.
Thanks.
Sacca: There's nothing
more frustrating
than asking questions
about somebody's tech stack
and not getting
any answers back.
Moati: The Sharks did not see
the opportunity today.
They gave us
absolutely no time
nor a chance to explain
how we do business,
and that was a shame.
Shame on them.
Their whole point is
they simplify that process.
But they automate that.
Yeah.
Look ?? it's a problem
that needs to be solved,
the hotels would like
to make the extra money.
They didn't do anything
to convince us
that they're
the guys to do it.
And they're
cockroaches.
