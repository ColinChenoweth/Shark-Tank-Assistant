Hi, Sharks.
My name is Scott Lininger.
And I'm Aidan Chopra,
and we are from
beautiful Boulder, Colorado.
Our company is Bitsbox,
and we are here today
seeking $250,000
for 3% of our company.
Herjavec: Whew.
Bitsbox is the world's
most creative way
to teach kids a skill that will
change their lives forever ??
computer coding.
These days,
it's not enough
for kids to just know
how to use computers.
They need to know
the language of computers,
and that language
is called "coding."
Coding is a golden ticket to
a great job and a great future.
And the best thing
is that anybody can learn.
The hard part
about teaching kids to code
isn't getting them interested,
it's <i>keeping</i> them interested.
That's why
Bitsbox is a present
that comes in the mail
every month.
It's a subscription box
that teaches
real computer programming.
So, we wanted to show you
how it works.
So, what we did is invite one of
our very favorite Bitsbox?ers ??
Grace, over there ??
to help us.
Now, Grace's box
just came in the mail,
and she's super excited.
It just so happens
that this month,
there is a "Shark Tank" app
in the box.
She goes to the Bitsbox website
she goes into her account,
she starts
a brand?new app,
and she starts
to type in the code
exactly as it appears
on the card.
Now, here's the thing ??
code is just
a set of instructions
that tells a computer
what to do.
So, if we actually look
at the code that she's typed,
you can see line one
tells the computer
to fill the screen
with an image of a shark tank.
Line two tells it to stamp an
image of a shark on the screen,
and line three says, "Hey,
when somebody taps that shark,
I want you
to make the shark pop."
The Bitsbox approach
is to give the kids
lots of example projects,
just like this one,
that they can build upon.
And eventually, you start making
your own stuff from scratch.
Now, Grace is pretty advanced,
so she's already gone
and created the rest
of the challenges in this app.
Herjavec: Whoa.
And you can see,
she's made a full video game
with animations
and sound effects.
?Oh.
?Oh.
"Mark wins?"
I'm out.
Cuban: Good, Grace.
[ Laughs ]
So, Sharks, who wants
to help us change the world?
Grace, how old are you?
10.
Were you coding
before you did this?
Yes. I was coding Python
and some C++ before this.
[ Chuckles ]
I mean, that's awesome.
What do you want to be
when you grow up?
I want to be
a bionic?limb programmer.
A bionic?limb programmer,
huh?
What?!
?Good for you, Grace.
?That's amazing.
Well, what makes you
want to do that?
Yeah.
Well, 'cause I really loved
anatomy when I was little,
and I actually told
my neighbor one time ??
I brought out
my book of diseases to him
and I said, "What's your
favorite disease?"
[ Laughter ]
And I said,
"Mine's tapeworm."
[ Laughter ]
We had that same conversation
at lunch with Kevin.
Yeah.
All right,
tell us about the business.
You bet. So, Bitsbox ranges
in monthly subscriptions
from $20 to $40 a month,
depending on the options
that you choose.
How long do I have
to sign up for?
It's up to you.
You can start up
month?to?month
and cancel at any time,
or you can sign up
for a full year in advance.
What do I get
for that price difference?
The $40 level
is the full box.
It has a set of app cards
every month.
You get a toy
that matches the theme,
such as a whoopee cushion
with code on it.
Anything else we can think of
to keep the kids excited.
What is the ages for this?
Somewhere between
6 and 14.
Cuban: What does a box
cost you to make?
About $10.
But that's at printing very,
very small quantities of paper.
It gets much cheaper
at scale.
How long
have you been doing this,
and what
have your sales been?
We launched the product
less than two years ago.
Wow.
Since then, we've done
$1.3 million in revenue.
Are you making
any money yet?
We're not
cash?flow positive yet
because we have a team
of five full?time people.
But we are on the road
to be cash?flow positive
this upcoming quarter.
What's your background?
Aidan and I met ??
we worked at the world's largest
Internet company, Google.
Scott built this as a prototype
for his daughter when she was 7.
She loved it, and a few other
kids loved it, as well.
He decided
he was gonna quit, and ??
you want
to re?create it?
Yeah.
[ Inspiring music plays ]
Aidan, let's quit.
Let's go teach
the world's children to code.
You had me
at "Let's quit."
We actually did that.
[ Laughter ]
We did that because,
at the time, you know ??
it was pretty good.
Herjavec:
That was really good!
And did you go out
and raise money
after that romantic...?
Yeah. So, we did a seed round
last summer for $500,000
on a $4 million
pre?money valuation.
$250,000 at 3% imputes
an $8 million value.
Mm?hmm.
Why would you
raise the price
by a factor of seven
for a Shark?
Is that
a sign of disrespect?
No, no, not at all.
We looked at
all of our revenue to date,
and we took
a 10?x multiple on that.
We'd done about $400,000
in revenue.
How much of that
is left in the bank right now?
We raised a bridge note
last spring...
?How much?
?Oh, oh.
...for $600,000.
?Oh.
?Oh.
Chopra:
It's a convertible note
at a $6 million cap.
You did a great job
of selling yourselves.
This is a great
and very valuable product.
I'm gonna clear the field
to my fellow Sharks,
who have more experience in the
subscription business than I do.
So, I'm out.
?Thank you.
?Thank you, Lori.
O'Leary: What you're doing
is important because
we're only graduating 50,000
engineers a year in America,
and the Chinese are
graduating 260,000.
Wow.
We're losing the race.
So, this is very useful.
I'm glad you get it.
So, I'm going to applaud
watching Cuban and Sacca
beat the living you?know?what
out of each other
to get a piece
of this deal.
I'm out.
I don't know.
I didn't hear anything
from Robert.
You've done an amazing job.
I know this space.
Make an offer.
I'm not gonna
make an offer,
'cause I think
there's a lot of competition,
and I don't want
to be in this space.
I'm out.
?Okay. Thanks.
?Thank you.
Well, then, Mark Cuban,
Chris Sacca.
Guys, I'm gonna make it
easier on Chris.
I love what
you're doing, right?
I think the goal is phenomenal,
all right?
I think you've made
great progress.
But I think, to get it to scale
to any meaningful level,
I think it's gonna
be very difficult
and become
more expensive,
and you're gonna have
to raise much more money.
I'm out.
Okay.
Thanks.
Greiner:
And then there was one.
Hey, guys.
?Chris.
?Hey.
I love
being in this position.
We're Googlers,
you're a Googler.
[ Laughs ]
Feel free to be a savage
on equity, Sacca.
Look, I'm intrigued.
It's a company I can believe in.
Such an important
subject matter
to the kids of America
and beyond.
Yes.
And so,
I'm gonna make you an offer.
Sure.
I'm gonna give you
your 250K
at a $5 million valuation.
We do have many,
many other investors,
and I think
we want to do right by them
by making
the right decision.
But none of them
are Sharks.
No, we completely
understand that.
But I think what we want
to understand is,
dilution is a real thing,
and I think we're trying
to do the right thing by them,
as well.
I need to own
enough of your company
for me to get
really thrilled about it,
to throw everything I have
into it, and to go for it.
So, you asked
for an $8 million valuation.
Mr. Sacca's brought it way down
to $5 million.
?He sure has.
?What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna hit
Enter or Delete?
Chris has made an offer
for Scott and Aidan's
children's?coding
education company, Bitsbox.
But it is well below
their initial valuation.
So, you asked
for an $8 million valuation.
Mr. Sacca's brought it way down
to $5 million.
?He sure has.
?What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna hit
Enter or Delete?
So, Chris,
we think you're amazing.
No offense to any
of the other Sharks,
but you were the guy that
we would absolutely love
to have in the deal.
Good sucking up.
What about a valuation
of $7 million?
Ooh, all that niceness,
and then ?? boom.
Look, I'm very confident about
the value I bring to your deal.
I mean,
you guys moved 0.57% off
where you were
when you came in here.
Sure.
I see an inconsistency
in your statements ??
between all this love
you're showing me
and then the numbers
you came back with.
Ugh.
I don't even want
to come back.
Let me see
that piece of paper.
Sure.
Yeah.
Would you do 4%?
That's the valuation,
is 6 1/4 ??
$6.25 million.
$6.25 million.
Your last investors came in
at a $6 million cap.
Are we seriously
nickle?and?diming over $250,000?
I mean ??
?Wow.
You're that close, and you're
gonna show me the disrespect?
O'Leary:
Give him the $6 million.
Give him the $6 million.
[ Sighs ]
I'll tell you what ??
I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna make it
easy on you.
I know what I bring
to the table.
And this is a long,
long road ahead,
and you've got the ruler out
and you're measuring
in quarters of inches right now.
You're not looking
at the magnitude of value
I can bring down the road.
And so, I'm gonna make it
easy on you ?? I'm out.
?Oh, oh.
?Ouch.
?Ooh.
?Whoa.
The better way
to understand it is,
he wanted $5 million,
you wanted $8 million.
It seemed that you could've
agreed at $6 million,
you nickle?and?dimed him
for $6.25 million,
which, obviously,
he's not happy with.
Right.
If you did the deal
at $6 million,
I don't know.
Chris, what if
we did $6 million?
I know that you feel offended,
but you have to understand ??
this isn't malevolence,
it's ineptitude.
[ Laughter ]
We would love
to work with you.
It sends a message to me, you're
not focused on the bigger prize.
You're thinking about
some of the tiny, little
nit?picks along the way.
You're losing him!
You're losing him!
You know what,
I'm gonna jump in here
and say that
we would love to do...
What are we doing?
Can we do 4.75%?
Oh, my gosh,
why not just do the 5%?!
I'm sorry.
Let's sort of reset this.
And we completely agree that
having you on the Bitsbox team
would be worth
5% of equity to us.
So, with the benefit
of time and humility
and a certain amount
of humiliation,
uh, what do you think,
Scott?
[ Sighs ]
I mean, look, guys,
here's the thing...
W?Wow.
...three, four decimal places
matter a lot
when you're trying to put
a rocket on the moon.
Mm?hmm.
But in the early days
of your business,
when you're putting together
your founding teams,
your investors and users...
Yeah.
...it just shows me
your priorities and your focus
might be
in the wrong place,
that you're nitpicking
over that stuff
that really doesn't matter
a hill of beans in the end.
What do you think,
Scott?
[ Exhales sharply ]
Good luck to you guys.
I'm out.
Should we do it?
Should we do $5 million?
He's out!
Greiner: No, you guys.
He's out.
It's over.
Yeah. Y?You've hesitated
so many times.
And by the way,
I'm hiring Grace.
Oh, it's over?
We're done?
?Yeah.
?It's over.
There's no more to go?
It's over
for the third time.
Lininger: Okay, yeah.
Well, thank you very much,
Chris.
[ Scattered groans ]
I don't think we've ever lost
a deal on "Shark Tank" for .25%.
Thank you, everybody.
Okay.
?Thanks, guys.
?Thanks very much.
?Good luck, guys.
?Thank you, Grace.
Thank you for your time.
She's so polite.
Cuban:
She's so polite.
For .25%, they let it
slip between their fingers.
Bozos.
I think
you're pretty good.
Yeah.
You're doing pretty good
on your own.
I think we did okay.
You don't need
some famous person
with a lot of money
just to...
[ Laughs ]
...to keep going
with the business, you know?
That's right.
I like your attitude.
?Yeah.
?Thank you.
Thanks, Grace.
You made me feel better.
?Yeah.
?Cool.
