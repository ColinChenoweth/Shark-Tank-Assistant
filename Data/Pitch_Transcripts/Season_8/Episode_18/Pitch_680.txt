I'm Brandon.
I'm Steven.
And I'm Bruno.
And we're the owners
of Sand Cloud.
We love the beach,
and we used to go to the beach
all the time
right after work.
One of these days,
we woke up on the beach
super uncomfortable
and looked at each other
and had this idea of putting
a pillow inside a beach towel.
And that's when
we first came up with
our million?dollar idea,
the pillow towel.
We created the product and tried
selling it on the beach,
and that's when we realized
it was a total fail.
Nobody wanted it.
?Hey. How's it going, guys?
?What's going on?
We took this opportunity
and talked to
every single person
on the beach to figure out
exactly what they wanted.
And that's when
Sand Cloud was born.
As millennials,
having a business
with a social impact
is everything to us.
So we decided to donate 10% of
profits to protect marine life.
Have you guys seen
our numbers today?
We've risked everything.
We moved in together,
we sold our cars,
because there's no other option.
This is it.
Aschidamini:
It's not just about us.
Hi, Sharks.
My name's Brandon.
I'm Steven.
And I'm Bruno.
And we're the owners
of Sand Cloud.
Today, we're seeking
an investment of $200,000
in exchange for
8% of our company.
We live just steps away
from one of the most
beautiful beaches
in San Diego.
It was here
that we realized
it was time for a long?awaited
change to the standard towel.
Towels, since their inception,
are inherently plain.
?Unimaginative.
?Oh, my God.
?Oh! [ Laughs ]
?Yeah, baby. That's it!
?Boring!
?I didn't even catch that.
?Wow.
?And worse yet,
not so wonderful.
[ Laughter ]
What are you thinking?
?Oh, you guys!
?Oh!
You think there's
a chance in hell
you're getting 200 grand
from me?
[ Laughter ]
I'm out.
We knew that it was time to
introduce some new options...
?Yeah.
?... for a new generation.
And that's why
we started Sand Cloud.
Our unique
and vibrant patterns
Now Bruno's gonna go
around the room
and pass out
some samples for you.
?Thank you. Lori.
?Thank you.
?Thank you.
?Thank you.
Here's our
Baja Beach Blanket.
This is our
best?selling towel.
Cool.
Our Wanderlust.
?Which one?
?The Wanderlust.
Tie?dye.
So, Brandon,
it's very thin.
?Yeah.
?It ?? This ??
I wouldn't think
this would make a good towel
after I got out of the water.
Right. Well, those are all
actually handmade in Turkey
from fine Turkish cotton,
actually all in villages
in Turkey by families.
So, it's really good quality,
and that's why we charge
$47 for it, because ??
But it feels like a wrap
as opposed to a towel.
Yeah, 'cause, I mean, maybe it's
just how we're conditioned...
Yeah. It feels like
a scarf a little bit more.
...but, look, I started
my own company.
With the first commission check,
the first thing I did
was buy nice, thick,
fluffy towels,
because they just feel
so luxurious.
?Right.
?Actually, yeah,
when we first
started our company,
the first thing
we wanted to do,
we went to the towels that
were thicker and luxurious,
and when we tested the market
by selling one by one by two
at the beach, we found out
that people wanted
something different,
and they wanted something
that was easy to carry
in their backpack,
easy to fit in their purse.
That's fair enough.
So, this is more as
a beach product for the beach,
as opposed to in your home
in your ?? in your bathroom.
