It's about making a difference
in the environment
will ensure that you
turn heads wherever you go.
It feels more like
a wrap, though, like a sarong.
Yeah. So, the great thing
about these is because ??
you know, because of
the lightweight material,
it doubles as a sarong.
Doesn't he like that?
?People will pay 50 bucks
for this because it's really
about the whole lifestyle,
give back...
?Right.
?...baby seal.
?Exactly.
We see ourselves
as the next NEXCOMs of the sea.
?Sure.
?Because millennials need
a social cause to get behind
in order to support you.
?Are you selling on ??
?Well, the only thing is
that everybody has
a social cause now.
Every?? 100% of millennials
that come in selling,
it's all about cause.
Probably 50%. Right.
The three of us, we own
100% of the company.
Good for you.
We've been in business
That will still take me
Chef Ron,
let's break it down.
Starting with Vitamin C.
It comes from oranges, right?
Wrong.
It comes from corn extract
processed with acetone.
Yep. The same stuff
as nail polish remover.
?Ew.
?No.
?Really?
?Iron.
Sulfuric acid.
?No!
?What?!
?Oh, come on.
?No.

Synthetic growth hormone.

Greiner: Oh! Don't kill it,
don't kill it.
?Ohh!
?No!
We will be soon.
Man, this is good.
On the truffle,
I'm gonna give it a 9.26.
?Oh, wow.
So, this is
what you're selling?
Yes. So, we're selling
an Omega?3 spray,
Ron, tell us a little bit
about yourself.
So, uh, I'm a chef,
as you can see.
?How did you meet Will?
?So, we are actually, uh,
freshman?year roommates
in college at U. C. Berkeley.
Professionally, uh,
I come from a background of
So, Will, do you have
customers today?
Uh, we do.
To date, um,
in under 10 months, we've sold
over $400,000,
about $415,000.
?That's very good.
?Very good.
?That's not horrible.
?Very good.
?Where are you selling?
?We've sold ??
?Online mainly.
?Just online?
It's been
our only channel.
How much did you
sell last month?
Um, in the first seven months,
we sold like gangbusters
There's nothing wrong
with reaching for the stars,
but I'm a Shark.
I'm not just any investor.
That's also good news for you.
Because I'm gonna
make you an offer.
I'm gonna give you $375,000.
I want 20%.
Ohh!
Narrator:
Four Sharks are out.
that we've seen,
we would be willing
to consider a counter dropping
our valuation to $5 million.
I'll be flexible this way.
If I were to agree
to the last round,
to go back in a round
that you actually had
a trigger price at $2.2 million,
I would do 17%.
That is the match to that.
I've already done the math.
?Ooh.
?So, if you want to bring me
into the $2.2 million
round valuation,
I'll do $375,000 there
at 17%.
That's it, guys.
We would really love to find
a way to bring you onboard.
I just gave you a path.
As we look at where
our company is, our projections,
what we are going to sell
in the next 12 months ??
Guys, I?I've never seen
a forecast I haven't
liked, ever.
They're always fantastic.
Then I deal with the reality
with all my entrepreneurs
about how tough it is
to grow a business.
He's at 17%.
Where are you at?
What would you do
for $375,000?
So, we would consider,
um, because we want
to scale quickly,
uh, if ?? if you...
All right. Stop selling.
... if you would be willing
to do $500,000
in exchange for 10%?
Not doing that.
Goldberg: Along with the socks,
each recipient will receive
an information card about
how to access the V. A. benefits
I am seeking $300,000 in
exchange for 10% of DartDrones.
Sharks, drones are cool,
aren't they?
They're the ultimate tech toy.
You get the thrill
of piloting something
while, at the same time,
capturing amazing
aerial photographs.
Unfortunately, shots like these
don't happen all the time.
Far too often,
you get something like this.
[ Laughter ]
Greiner: Oh, no.
[ Laughter ]
?Ooh!
?Oh!
?Oh!
?Oh!
[ Laughter ]
People love drones,
but they don't know
how to fly them properly.
They fly where they shouldn't
or they crash into objects.
I believe that people should get
the most out of their drone,
DartDrones is the only
national drone training school
in the country.
We offer
custom?tailored courses,
whether you're
an aspiring drone entrepreneur
or a recreational user
just flying for fun.

Sharks, who's ready
to take off with DartDrones?
Can we try it?
You can try it.
So ??
I've never flown a drone.
Oh, okay. Good.
So, when you fly, um,
to turn on the props,
what you're gonna do
I am buying a drone.
So, it seems easy,
but, unfortunately,
a lot of people crash.
Like, I told you to just
touch it ever so slightly,
John: So, drones last year
were the highest?returned
product in history.
Over 60% of the drones purchased
were returned because...
They were crashed?
... Dad comes home with a drone,
he flies it around,
it ?? it hits the cat,
of drones coming back to them.
Right.
It upsells you.
Have you done
anything like that?
Yes. So we do partner
with hobby shops in the area,
so the others
will learn from this.
So, I'm gonna offer you
[ Laughs ]
$500,000 as a line of credit,
I will actually
allow myself
to be photographed
with Elephant Pants.
?No!
?You know, the big??
the bigger problem is
millennials are buying it...
Don't do it.
... right, from you?
?Yeah. They love them.
?They don't want to see
Kevin in those.
This is true.
Greiner:
I'll do that deal.
Would the three of you
consider partnering together
at $500,000 for 15%?
So, 5% each?
To save the elephants?
Straight equity
or a line of credit?
?Straight equity.
?Straight equity.
So you don't like
the line of credit?
'Cause that's what
they're offering.
Daymond, would you be willing
to do the $500,000 for 12%?
I respect ??
I respect the counter.
I think that you always
should counter.
Um, I'll go to $500,000
for 17.5%
Ooh.
?Hmm.
?He rarely comes back.
Okay.
Thank you, Daymond.
Does this mean you're not
countering to us?
But I will still be at 17.5%.
I?I?I will still stay at 17.5%.
The risk is
if you have no interest in
dealing with us as a team,
