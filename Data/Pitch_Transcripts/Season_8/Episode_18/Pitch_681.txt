Hi, Sharks.
My name's Abby Speicher.
What do you need
that $300,000 for, Abby?
To build curriculum.
What we notice in our classes
is that people in our classes
were actually commercial users,
so their company sent them
or their police
or fire department sent them.
So, what we have made,
this big shift to now not focus
Speicher: I feel awesome.
I can't believe
we got that deal.
It was perfect.
I mean, this just took us
to the next level.
But you just gave her
exactly what she asked for.
W?Why would you ?? Why would
you give her what she wanted?
She would've had flexibility.
Because the competition
isn't just with her.
It's with you guys, too.
I always hear people say,
"Oh, Mark just took the deal,
took the deal."
Here's what I learned.
He said he didn't want
to negotiate against us,
because he's afraid.
[ Laughs ] Oh, yeah.
That's why ??
?That's exactly right.
?That's a good point.
I was afraid of having
to listen to you guys.

Narrator: Next up
is a business that seeks
to help the animals
that inspired their company.
All right.
