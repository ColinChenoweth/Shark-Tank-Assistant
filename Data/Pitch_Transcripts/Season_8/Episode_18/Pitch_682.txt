Hi, Sharks.
My name's Abby Speicher.
What do you need
that $300,000 for, Abby?
To build curriculum.
What we notice in our classes
is that people in our classes
were actually commercial users,
so their company sent them
or their police
or fire department sent them.
So, what we have made,
this big shift to now not focus
so much on hobbyists and focus
more on commercial users.
How did you start
to do this?
Like, what ?? what
is your background?
I was born to be
an entrepreneur.
I started my first company
when I was 17.
We manufactured purses
in Ghana, Africa,
and then sent them here
to be sold
and then funded kids' education
while in Ghana.
At the end of college, I knew
I wanted to be an entrepreneur.
I wanted to do something
really innovative,
and I?I didn't know if the ??
the purses were really for me.
I?I've only ever owned
like three purses.
[ Laughter ]
Um, so, like, I wasn't really
a purse person.
I decided I wanted to go to
Babson for the MBA program.
Um, so, I applied and I got in,
so I was the youngest person
in my class, and I ended up
graduating,
went in their B. E. T. A.
Business Plan Competition
that happens every year,
and I graduated
with the Entrepreneurship Award
and a few other awards
for entrepreneurship.
?Good for you.
Do you have
competition with this,
or you the only ones
doing it?
Not really. So, we're
the only national one.
Um, the only other
companies out there offer ??
One offers
an unaccredited PhD.,
which I don't really get,
and the other one, um,
they're ?? they're like $4,000
for a seven?day course.
What about colleges?
Are any colleges or community
colleges offering this?
Um, they have approached <i>us</i>
to license our curriculum out,
so we're working on
curriculum again.
Which is exactly where
I was going, yeah.
?Wow.
?Yes.
Speicher: I feel awesome.
I can't believe
we got that deal.
It was perfect.
I mean, this just took us
to the next level.
But you just gave her
exactly what she asked for.
W?Why would you ?? Why would
you give her what she wanted?
She would've had flexibility.
Because the competition
isn't just with her.
It's with you guys, too.
I always hear people say,
"Oh, Mark just took the deal,
took the deal."
Here's what I learned.
He said he didn't want
to negotiate against us,
because he's afraid.
[ Laughs ] Oh, yeah.
That's why ??
?That's exactly right.
?That's a good point.
I was afraid of having
to listen to you guys.

Narrator: Next up
is a business that seeks
to help the animals
that inspired their company.
All right.
