Hi, Sharks.
My name's Nathan Coleman.
And my name
is James Brooks.
We are
the Elephant Pants...
Together: [ New York accents ]
From Brooklyn, New York.
Shout out of Brooklyn.
We're seeking $500,000
for a 10% share
of our company.
Our awesome company.
[ Chuckles ]
James, hit them
with the motto.
Save elephants.
Feel good.
So, how do we save
these elephants?
We actually gave them
pants to wear.
Our mascot Ellie over here
is wearing one of
our newest styles.
[ Chuckles ]
Okay. I can see some of you
aren't buying it.
But, don't worry.
We're just messing with you.
[ Zipper zips ]
This is our
real business.
We make these glorious
pants right here
that help save elephants.
These are our
harem pants.
A.K.A. the most comfortable
pants in the world.
M.C. Hammer
can't touch these.
[ Dance music plays ]
[ Laughter ]
I didn't expect that.
So, Sharks, who's ready
to join our herd
and help us save elephants
one leg at a time?
So, we got some samples
for you guys.
There you go, Robert.
Thank you.
Lori.
Thank you.
James and Nathan have
one offer on the table.
$500,000 for 17.5%
from Daymond
for their clothing company,
Elephant Pants.
Daymond,
would you do 15%?
?Oh. That just took me up to ??
?You're a smart guy.
?Yeah. That was.
?Yeah. I was at 17.5%.
What's your concern, um,
'cause now they're out?
And now, I'm ??
I'm the elephant in the room.
?Just a fair val??
Really, it's a fair valuation
for the company
and also
the other partners.
Um, yes, we own
the majority share,
but we also want to make sure
we respect their equity stakes
in the business, as well,
so that we're getting
a fair valuation.
Do 2% advisory shares.
If you're worried about other
investors and how it hits
anything there,
do 2% in advisory shares
so that your numbers
hit the way you need them.
I'm confident the 5% difference
of where you were at,
I'm confident I'm gonna grow
that company more than 5%.
Is that what you're saying,
you're gonna stay at 17.5%?
Well, would you do 15%
with 2.5% advisory shares?
?Those are options.
?Yeah.
No. They ??
They vest, right?
Once they vest,
you're owned, right?
They're not options.
It's Daymond's money.
?They're shares.
?Right.
They're shares.
He can structure it
any way he wants.
Greiner: He's the only elephant
left in the room.
They're saying
they can do the deal.
They just want to
not have to deal with
their other partners
and explain the valuation.
Yeah, at the end of the day,
long as I'm gonna end up
with 17.5%.
Yeah.
Okay.
We good?
Let's save some elephants!
All right, Daymond.
We got a deal!
Let's do it.
Let's Hammer dance.
?All right!
?Let's Hammer dance.
You ready for the dance?
You gonna do it?
?Yeah.
?Let's do it.
All right.
One, two, three, go.
[ Laughter ]
?Yep.
?Congratulations, guys.
?Congratulations.
?Good luck.
?Thank you.
?Seriously, guys, thank you.
We really appreciate it.
?Bye, elephant.
?Good luck.
Greiner: Bye.
Here's the real
important point.
There's 350,000 people
that are wearing these!
[ Both grunt ]
Striking a deal
with Daymond
is gonna bring our company
from here up to here.
I mean, he's really gonna
help us drive long?term sales
and grow our brand
into a household name.
And, not only that, but we get
to save a lot more elephants.
And elephants get
to keep their own ivory.
Boom!
