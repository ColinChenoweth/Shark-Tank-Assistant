My name is Tara Brown.
?Thank you, Robert.
?Thank you, Tara.
?Got to zip it open?
?You have gorgeous hair.
Thank you.
We want all
of your hair products.
O'Leary: So, Tara,
as you can imagine,
I spend a lot of time
in the morning making sure
every one of my hairs
is in place.
[ Laughter ]
But what really keeps me
awake at night
is thinking about sales.
So, tell me how much you've got
in sales on this thing?
So, I launched two months ago
on Kickstarter,
That's incredible.
Tara, what do you
sell it for?
Uh, it retails for $39.
?The package as we see here?
?The package of eight.
So, Tara, why do you need
the $75,000?
You ?? ophthalmologists
make good money, I assume.
Why didn't you
put it up yourself?
Uh, because that wouldn't
give me the value of a Shark.
I need a business ninja
in my corner.
What do you need
the most?
I took this product
to CosmoProf,
the world's biggest
beauty trade show,
where it really created
a frenzy.
Yeah, I've spoken there
the last couple of years.
I was approached
by Amazon Launchpad, HSN, QVC,
Tara, I want you
to say yes right now.
I think you know if I would be
the right partner for you.
You don't have to say
yes right now.
You have four other Sharks
to hear from.
?It's not fair...
?Ooh.
...to just get stamped
for 30% of your equity...
?I want it.
?... when clearly there's
other Sharks interested.
?I want to tell you something.
If you were going
into a prize fight,
you'd want a heavyweight fighter
that was in that,
uh, "weight," right?
?Yes.
You would want somebody
who loves your product
as much as you do.
?Thanks, Tara. Congrats.
?Thank you, Tara.
Thank you.
It was over really fast,
but I'm afraid if I took my time
