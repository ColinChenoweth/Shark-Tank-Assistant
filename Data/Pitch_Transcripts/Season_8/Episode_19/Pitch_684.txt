and nickled and dimed,
I could've lost the offer.
So, I'm glad it worked out.
Narrator: Next up
is a unique way
to enjoy a favorite beverage.
My name is Billy Dim,
and I'm the creator/owner
of Blendtique Wine Company.
My partners and I are seeking
$250,000 in exchange for
a 10% equity share
of the business.
Blendtique invites you
to participate
in a revolutionary new process
whereby the everyday consumer
can create and design
their very own
personalized wine blends
from the comfort of home.
Our signature blending kit
comes with
four premium Central Coast
single?varietal wines,
and Erlenmeyer flask, measuring
pipette, and instruction manual.
It's everything you'll need
to experiment with wine blends
until you've created
a result you love
and is uniquely personal to you.
Once you've identified
your perfect wine,
simply log on to our website
to upload your favorite blend,
design your original label,
and order your very own
personalized wine.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to Blendtique Wine Company,
and welcome to your wine.
We're gonna invite
Kevin and Barbara up here
to have a little blending trial,
a little competition.
?Ooh, yummy.
?Absolutely.
?I'm all for it.
?And we're gonna
walk you through the process.
In this case, if we were
gonna be doing it
as part of a blending class,
uh, we would obviously be
taking the evening to do it.
If we were gonna be
doing it as a date night,
this is something you could do,
um, from the comfort of home
and take your time.
And yes, of course,
get familiar with the wines.
I will be
blending a Meritage.
Beautiful!
Well, so, you have
the Merlot in front of you.
I'm gonna encourage you to taste
each of the individual wines.
So then, we're gonna move on
to the Cabernet Sauvignon.
We're really trying to
de?mystify the wine experience.
Cab Sauv is part of my
Meritage blend I'll be creating.
Wonderful.
?He's such a snob.
?And then we're going to
move on to the ??
?Barbara's gonna fall over.
Herjavec: Yeah, Barbara's
already drunk!
I can't tell you how much
I'm into this pitch.
[ Laughter ]
I want you
to know I'm in.
Okay, wonderful!
Barbara, would this be a good
date for you and Kevin?
You know, already I'm
falling in love with him.
[ Laughter ]
We're gonna actually have
a little competition.
So, you guys are gonna create
your favorite blend here.
?Cheers, Lori.
?Cheers, Lori.
And then, our remaining panel of
Sharks are gonna be our judges.
He's got
all the tools in play.
I'm just fine?tuning this
amazing Meritage I've created.
All right,
who's the winner, Billy?
I got to know!
In this case, Barbara,
you beat out Kevin.
?Impossible.
?Oh, my God!
Impossible!
?Impossible.
?That's hilarious.
So much for
the Chevaliers Du Tastevin!
Listen, this is all
part of the fun.
There's no way Barb blended
a better wine than me.
?He says there's no way...
?Of course I did.
?...Barb blended better.
?It's crap.
Okay, you're going way
off in the weeds because
several of us
are starting to feel it.
So you've got to
get right to the point.
Do you have sales?
So, we've been in business
for a little over two years.
In that timeframe, we've done
about $200,000 in sales.
?Oh, that's not bad.
?However ??
So, Billy,
how do I find this?
Is this a subscrishon ??
I can't even talk anymore.
Is this
a subscription service?
How do you
send it to me?
We have an e?commerce business
where we have a website
that we do direct
to consumer online.
How much is it?
Uh, the kit right now
retail goes for about $99.
Billy, what's your cost
on that kit?
So, on this kit,
it is about $35 per unit.
So your margin's okay.
Margin's okay.
You said you were
doing classes.
Is that a revenue source
for you right now?
So, that's ?? that's
a big part of where
the program has
actually evolved to.
What we've found is that
a big, big application
for this business
is actually in the hotel,
hospitality,
and catering industry.
Right.
And in particular,
the cruise lines.
So, that's ?? that's
really the direction
we really want to go.
Look, Billy, that's taking you
in a whole different direction.
Right, I don't get the ??
But it's a huge
revenue?maker for us.
I see the upside
there, right,
but that's not what
you came in with, right?
You didn't come in and say,
"Look, we are gonna just
crush it with experiential
classrooms where people get to
have fun with wine."
You came in selling fun
of the experience at home.
That is not the path
of least resistance
in any way, shape, or form.
I'm out.
I thought
you were selling fun.
Of course we are!
Somewhere along the way,
the end?user goal was
to sell a bottle of wine.
Then, I heard
wine classes.
Then, I heard
the hospitality business.
But it sounds to me like
you're going in many directions.
Don't waste
your breath on me.
It's just not a business
that I understand or enjoy.
I'm out.
You came in here ??
I kind of thought this was
a party?favor kit.
And you are having
a great experience for that.
Let me tell you,
that great experience ??
I almost wanted
to kiss Kevin.
That's how happy I became.
[ Laughs ]
What do I pay for
my case of wine?
Once I develop my own wine,
I want to get it.
So, if you're ?? if you're
buying a full case of your wine,
uh, you're looking at $300.
?Ouch!
?Wow.
?Wait a minute.
?Billy, how many bottles
in a case?
?So what's in ?? yeah.
12 bottles.
?Is that a lot?
?$25 a bottle.
But if I've done that party
in my home that I just did,
what percentage of those folks
order a case of wine?
Currently, the purchase rate
is about 15%.
I think 15% is
a terrible conversion rate
on something like that.
I don't see you selling
a lot of wine so sadly,
I've enjoyed the party,
sweetheart,
[clicks tongue]
but I'm out.
Billy, I spend a ton
of time in the wine business.
It's a tough business.
And 97% in America of wine is
sold for under $13.90 a bottle.
You will never sell wine
for over 14 bucks a bottle.
Narrator: Three Sharks are out,
and Kevin is concerned
about the high price point
for Billy's wine
novelty product, Blendtique.
?$25 a bottle.
?Ouch.
You will never sell wine
for over 14 bucks a bottle.
You have to remember though,
this is really
a hand?craft item.
?I get it.
?Yeah, but people don't
respect that or appreciate that.
You should've captured me
in this business.
I mean, my goodness.
But when I saw
what you were selling it...
I don't think it's too late.
I really believe that you'll...
No, no, it's too late.
I'm out.
I'm out, I'm out.
What I'm sitting here
thinking about is,
I love it as a gift.
I love it as something
that people can do
as an experience together
just to have fun.
Of course.
But my concern is
your price point.
Can you get this down
to $49.99?
Yes.
And then, can you
get your bottle to,
I don't know,
$13 a bottle?
I would say if we ship it
direct to the consumer, 100%.
Um, I'll give you
a flyer, Billy.
I'll give you a chance.
?Oh, great!
?A flyer!
I'll give you $250,000
for 30%.
?Ouch.
?That's a little high.
It's a little steep.
So, I have a partner.
Yeah.
He would want me to counter
with, um, $250,000 for 15%.
I like you, Billy.
I'm taking a chance, 'cause
there's a lot of "ifs."
I know I can help you.
The lowest I'll go ??
I will go $250,000 for 25%.
It's up to you.
You need a workhorse.
I'm a Clydesdale.
So, my investor is actually
a bit of a Shark himself.
He's been in it with me
from the get?go.
The only thing I could
consider doing would be
to dilute my shares beyond
what he is offering
to dilute on his side.
?What are your shares, Billy?
?That's a commitment
right there.
?'Cause I don't want to do
something that is
wrong for you.
I own 49%.
So, if you would be willing
to meet in the middle
at $250,000 for 20%,
I would dilute my remaining
percentage down
to meet you at that level.
What if I do this
where I give you a loan?
I give you
a $250,000 loan.
I take 8% interest,
10% equity.
?There you go.
?And I do it like that.
That's a lot better than
it sounds 'cause you get her.
I would like
to do that deal with you.
?Yes!
?Yay!
Mazel Tov!
?Let's have a drink!
?Yay, whoo!
What did I tell you?
Thank you.
Thank you.
It's a great gift.
It's super fun.
Thank you, guys.
?Thank you, guys.
?Thank you very much.
Thanks, Billy.
Dim: So, having Lori on board,
being able to really
