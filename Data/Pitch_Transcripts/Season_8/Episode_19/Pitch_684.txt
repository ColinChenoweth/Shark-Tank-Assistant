My name is Tara Brown.
I live with my husband, Jason,
and my two kids,
Wesley and Clara.
My husband and I
are both doctors.
I'm an ophthalmologist,
and he's a cardiologist.
I don't think some people
realize what it actually takes
for a woman to get ready
in the morning.
There's hair, makeup,
and that's before
you've woken up the kids
to get them ready.
We're gonna be late.
My product is unique,
and it solves a near?universal
problem for women.
Okay, Wes,
what's the valuation?
My kids love "Shark Tank."
They know
all the Sharks by name,
and they definitely
have their favorites.
?Put some more in there.
?Thank you.
Being an entrepreneur has been
a great educational experience.
It teaches my kids
about self?reliance,
which is very important to me.
I've invested $100,000
into this business.
It's scary because that
could be my kids' education.
My husband and I still have
student loans
after practicing for 10 years.
That's a lot of money.
We have a lot riding on this.
I'm representing all of us
when I go into the Tank,
so I cannot let them down.
My name is Tara Brown,
and I'm from San Diego.
I am seeking $75,000
in exchange for
a 20% equity stake
in my business.
Sharks, this video illustrates
a typical morning
for women everywhere.
The girl in pink
has to get her hair washed,
blown out, and styled
before she's ready to go.
But the girl in blue
used the Sleep Styler ??
the roller that dries and styles
your hair while you sleep.
So she woke up
with her hair already done.
Wow.
The Sleep Styler girl has time
to actually enjoy her morning,
[ Chuckles ]
and is already out the door
while the other poor girl
is still styling.
The average woman spends
an hour a day on her hair,
but I spent just five minutes
putting these rollers in
after a relaxing bath
last night.
The Sleep Styler is made
with super?absorbent
yoga?towel fabric that
wicks moisture out of the hair
while remaining
dry to the touch.
The memory foam inside
is marshmallow?soft
and ensures
a fabulous night's sleep.
The unique shape
maximizes air flow
and allows you
to curl or straighten.
Plus, the hair becomes
softer and shinier
once you lose
those damaging hot tools.
So, Sharks, who's ready to
curl up with the Sleep Styler?
Do you have samples?
I have samples.
'Cause I want
to try it tonight.
[ Laughter ]
Thank you very much.
I'm gonna grab one for Lori ??
there's yours.
?Thank you, Robert.
?Thank you, Tara.
?Got to zip it open?
?You have gorgeous hair.
Thank you.
We want all
of your hair products.
O'Leary: So, Tara,
as you can imagine,
I spend a lot of time
in the morning making sure
every one of my hairs
is in place.
[ Laughter ]
But what really keeps me
awake at night
is thinking about sales.
So, tell me how much you've got
in sales on this thing?
So, I launched two months ago
on Kickstarter,
and I made my goal
in the first 12 hours,
and I closed the 30?day campaign
at $47,000.
?Oh, good for you!
?Wow!
?What was your goal?
?$10,000.
Tearing it up, Tara.
And since then,
it's been for sale
exclusively on my website.
?And how many have you sold?
?And how much have you sold?
Um, that's been
three weeks ?? $6,000.
Are you a hair stylist?
I'm an ophthalmologist.
?Of course you are.
?Well, that makes perfect sense.
Okay, I got to know.
How did the eye doctor
go to a hair doctor?
So, as a working mom,
I could never find time
to blow out and curl
my naturally frizzy hair.
You have frizzy hair?
Very frizzy hair.
I've tried every straightener,
the keratin,
and no?? those all
just damaged my hair.
I was tired of every day
being a ponytail day.
Right?
Exactly, so...
[ Laughs ]
And even when I did
take the time to blow it out
and style it, my hair
was dull and dry
from all that heat damage.
Then one day, I was
taking a braid out of
my daughter, Clara's, hair that
I'd put in wet the day before.
And I was thinking about how it
still had that braid wave in it.
Mm, well said.
And it stayed that way
until she washed it again,
so I started thinking about
that quality of hair
that whatever shape it's in,
as it goes from wet to dry
is how it will stay.
And I wondered if I could
use that quality
to passively dry hair
to appealing shapes.
And when was that?
That was last summer.
Oh, you've done this
really fast.
So, I quickly realized that
I needed to make a sewn product,
but I didn't know how to sew.
So I enrolled in fashion school.
?And I ??
?You enrolled in fashion school?
Yes, I ??
What about
the ophthalmology practice?
I have that, too.
?Why not?
?And you're a mom.
?And your kids...
?How many days a week
do you do the ophthalmology?
?I do surgery and see patients
three days a week.
The other four days
and all nights
are spent on my hair company.
And after finishing the first
semester of fashion school,
I was able to speak
knowledgeably
with my manufacturer about
things like seam allowances
and surged edges,
and so was able to create
a beautifully
constructed product.
That's so impressive.
What do you sell it for?
You're operating on eyes
one minute,
going to fashion school
the next...
Exactly.
...developing product,
and raise your kids.
That's incredible.
Tara, what do you
sell it for?
Uh, it retails for $39.
?The package as we see here?
?The package of eight.
?And what does it cost you?
?What does it cost you to make?
Delivered to San Diego, $9.94.
?Wow, great margin.
?Wow!
How much
have you invested?
I've spent $100,000
of my own money.
Oh, wow,
you're all in, then.
Well, can I ask you ??
it's amazing to me.
In a year and a half, you were
a full?time ophthalmologist.
?Yes.
?You have children.
?Yes.
?And you got this business
off the ground.
How did you do that?
'Cause I can accomplish the work
of three people in one day.
So, Tara, why do you need
the $75,000?
You ?? ophthalmologists
make good money, I assume.
Why didn't you
put it up yourself?
Uh, because that wouldn't
give me the value of a Shark.
I need a business ninja
in my corner.
What do you need
the most?
I took this product
to CosmoProf,
the world's biggest
beauty trade show,
where it really created
a frenzy.
Yeah, I've spoken there
the last couple of years.
I was approached
by Amazon Launchpad, HSN, QVC,
buyers everywhere
from Dubai to England.
And I, uh, want
to make the right decision.
I haven't signed anything yet.
You know, I love this.
First off, it feels like
a beautiful ultra?suede.
It's a microfiber, it's plushy,
and really soft and comfortable.
I put it behind my head,
and I would want to sleep on it.
I think it's genius.
I'm gonna make you an offer.
One of my things is that
when I really want something,
I just go for it.
And I'm gonna apologize to
my fellow Sharks right now.
Well, there may be
other offers, Lori.
I'm gonna make you an offer,
and, uh, I'm gonna
try to shut it down.
So, I'm gonna make you an offer
of $75,000 for 30%.
I think this would be perfect
for QVC with me ??
I'm gonna blow it out.
And I think it could be
a great infomercial item,
which I'm also expert at.
And I just want you
to say yes right now.
Wait, wait.
There's other offers coming.
It's an offer!
I could sell so much
of this on QVC.
It's an offer.
No, he couldn't!
Absolutely.
He's bald!
That's the point!
[ Laughter ]
?What?
?That's the point.
I'd be huge
on QVC with this.
Tara, I want you
to say yes right now.
I think you know if I would be
the right partner for you.
You don't have to say
yes right now.
You have four other Sharks
to hear from.
?It's not fair...
?Ooh.
...to just get stamped
for 30% of your equity...
?I want it.
?... when clearly there's
other Sharks interested.
?I want to tell you something.
If you were going
into a prize fight,
you'd want a heavyweight fighter
that was in that,
uh, "weight," right?
?Yes.
You would want somebody
who loves your product
as much as you do.
?You want this thing.
?And that's the kind of partner
that you want.
Um...can I make
a counter?
?Yeah.
?Of course you can.
I've never seen her this
excited about a product.
?Yeah, counter.
?Make a counter.
Yes.
?Um...
25%?
Done.
Yeah!
[ Laughter ]
I want a happy partner,
and I want to blow it out.
Oh, my God.
That's the best product
she's bought this season.
?Thank you.
?That was everything for me.
When I saw it, I knew
instantly it's great.
?Thanks, Tara. Congrats.
?Thank you, Tara.
Thank you.
It was over really fast,
but I'm afraid if I took my time
