My name is Billy Dim,
All right,
who's the winner, Billy?
I got to know!
In this case, Barbara,
you beat out Kevin.
?Impossible.
?Oh, my God!
Impossible!
?Impossible.
?That's hilarious.
So much for
the Chevaliers Du Tastevin!
Listen, this is all
part of the fun.
There's no way Barb blended
a better wine than me.
?He says there's no way...
?Of course I did.
?...Barb blended better.
?It's crap.
Okay, you're going way
off in the weeds because
several of us
are starting to feel it.
So you've got to
get right to the point.
Do you have sales?
So, we've been in business
for a little over two years.
In that timeframe, we've done
about $200,000 in sales.
?Oh, that's not bad.
?However ??
So, Billy,
how do I find this?
Is this a subscrishon ??
I can't even talk anymore.
Is this
a subscription service?
How do you
send it to me?
We have an e?commerce business
where we have a website
that we do direct
to consumer online.
How much is it?
Uh, the kit right now
retail goes for about $99.
Billy, what's your cost
on that kit?
So, on this kit,
it is about $35 per unit.
So your margin's okay.
Margin's okay.
You said you were
doing classes.
Is that a revenue source
for you right now?
So, that's ?? that's
a big part of where
the program has
actually evolved to.
What we've found is that
a big, big application
for this business
is actually in the hotel,
Look, Billy, that's taking you
in a whole different direction.
Right, I don't get the ??
But it's a huge
revenue?maker for us.
I see the upside
there, right,
but that's not what
you came in with, right?
?Wait a minute.
?Billy, how many bottles
in a case?
?So what's in ?? yeah.
12 bottles.
?Is that a lot?
?$25 a bottle.
But if I've done that party
in my home that I just did,
what percentage of those folks
order a case of wine?
Currently, the purchase rate
is about 15%.
I think 15% is
a terrible conversion rate
on something like that.
I don't see you selling
a lot of wine so sadly,
I've enjoyed the party,
sweetheart,
[clicks tongue]
but I'm out.
Billy, I spend a ton
of time in the wine business.
It's a tough business.
for Billy's wine
novelty product, Blendtique.
?$25 a bottle.
?Ouch.
You will never sell wine
for over 14 bucks a bottle.
You have to remember though,
Um, I'll give you
a flyer, Billy.
I'll give you a chance.
?Oh, great!
?A flyer!
I'll give you $250,000
for 30%.
?Ouch.
?That's a little high.
It's a little steep.
So, I have a partner.
Yeah.
He would want me to counter
with, um, $250,000 for 15%.
I like you, Billy.
I'm taking a chance, 'cause
there's a lot of "ifs."
I know I can help you.
The lowest I'll go ??
I will go $250,000 for 25%.
It's up to you.
You need a workhorse.
I'm a Clydesdale.
So, my investor is actually
a bit of a Shark himself.
He's been in it with me
from the get?go.
The only thing I could
consider doing would be
to dilute my shares beyond
what he is offering
to dilute on his side.
?What are your shares, Billy?
?That's a commitment
right there.
?'Cause I don't want to do
something that is
wrong for you.
I own 49%.
So, if you would be willing
to meet in the middle
at $250,000 for 20%,
I would dilute my remaining
percentage down
to meet you at that level.
What if I do this
where I give you a loan?
I give you
a $250,000 loan.
I take 8% interest,
10% equity.
Thanks, Billy.
Dim: So, having Lori on board,
being able to really
