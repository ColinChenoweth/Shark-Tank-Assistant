Now, Mark, just so
you know, 'cause I know
you're just wondering ??
a Meritage takes
the skill of a master.
A member of
the Chevaliers Du Tastevin.
Chevaliers Du Tastevin!
I have created
the O'Leary Meritage.
Wonderful!
Hi.
I'm Mark Bernstein.
I'm from San Francisco,
Mark, how much weight
did you lose on this?
I lost 15 pounds.
Mark, let me take
a stab at it.
?Okay.
?You know, this is the first
weight?reduction product that's
ever come on to "Shark Tank"
?Thanks, Mark.
?Good luck, Mark.
Thanks, guys.
They are celebrities.
They're thin, they're fit,
they have trainers.
Not everybody has that.
Mark, what do you
think about Kevin
on "Dancing with the Stars"?
I would love it.
You would lose 25 pounds
like that.
?I want Mark's.
?Yeah, I'll swap with you.
Are these each a slice
of the billboard?
Yeah, so, a typical billboard
is around, like, 14x48 feet.
So, it's as big
as this room, almost.
How did you get to this?
Where ?? where'd you come from?
So, the outdoor marketing
company takes it down.
So, what we do is
we have supply contracts
with the two largest
outdoor marketing companies.
So a 70% mark?up.
Right, so you've got
70% margins.
Yes.
So last month,
you should've made money.
Yeah, we did. Actually, it was
a turning point in our company.
?How much did you make?
?Uh, I think it was like, 5K.
?Yeah!
?Yeah!
Where'd you get the money
to absorb the loss?
So, in the beginning,
I put in $60,000,
where you could
market them that way,
then you have a unique,
sustainable position.
