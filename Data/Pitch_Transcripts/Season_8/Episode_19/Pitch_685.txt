Now, Mark, just so
you know, 'cause I know
you're just wondering ??
a Meritage takes
the skill of a master.
A member of
the Chevaliers Du Tastevin.
Chevaliers Du Tastevin!
I have created
the O'Leary Meritage.
Wonderful!
And it is nectar
from the nipple of Aphrodite.
[ Laughs ]
I'm ready to compete with
the swill that Barbara has.
Bring it on!
And it should be
a blind taste test.
That's what we want to do.
Yeah, so, we're gonna do
a little mixing behind my back,
and we're not gonna
know who's is who.
Is she drinking
out of a straw?
?[ Laughs ] Oh, God.
?Barbara!
And now we're supposed
to drink that?
I can't watch that.
?Ah.
?No more dates with you.
?She loves her blend.
?Oh, my God.
[ Laughter ]
Amazing!
Barbara,
can I try your blend?
Oh! Oh!
Oh, that's swill!
All right, are you ready?
I can't see, I can't see!
?All right, thank you.
?Lori doesn't have one.
?Yeah. Good.
?Okay.
So, which one's...
Oh, that's nasty!
I have a definite winner.
Okay, so wine number one...
Horrible!
How many people like wine one?
?Me.
?Me.
And how many people
like wine two?
Obviously, the remaining.
highlight and market and share
the product with the world
just because of her exposure
and being who she is
and her relationships ??
it's gonna be invaluable to us.
Herjavec:
I was born in Croatia,
which was a Communist country
when I was there
called Yugoslavia.
We had dirt floors and hay
and no running water
for a long time,
but it never seemed bad
'cause I was a little kid,
and my grandmother,
lots of family,
dogs, cats, horses.
You never know the situation
you grow up in
until you compare it
to something else.
Yugoslavia was a great country,
if you were part
of the Communist Party.
My dad was very anti?Communist,
and would say all kinds
of bad things about Communism.
And he got thrown in jail
22 times,
and the last time
he got thrown in, he was told,
"If you come back,
you will never return."
He packed a suitcase,
grabbed my mom and me,
and we crossed the border
to Italy, got on a boat,
and came to Canada.
In Yugoslavia,
my dad was such a happy guy.
He was a manager,
and he was pretty up there.
He was well?respected
for what he did.
He then he comes to Canada,
and he's sweeping floors
in a factory.
He was never the same.
I think I'm like
every other kid.
You never appreciate your
parents un?? until they're gone.
And I just think
how hard he worked
to give me that opportunity.
And I just feel such a need
to justify that sacrifice.
I had lots of dreams
when I was growing up.
I wanted to be a detective,
a vet, a race car driver.
I was so unfocused.
My best friend went for this
interview at a computer company,
and I'm thinking,
"Computers ?? who cares?
Boring!"
Until he says
the starting salary is $30,000.
I'm like, "What?"
And he says,
"Well, I didn't get the job.
Here's the guy's number.
Call him."
That's how I got started
in the computer business.
The Herjavec Group
is one of the world's
largest
cyber?security companies.
I'm really passionate about it,
because it feels like
we do good.
I really think
the world is changing.
The Internet has a lot of good,
but it has a lot
of potential bad.
And by protecting companies,
we're making the world
a safer place.
I think what makes me different
than the other Sharks
is I'm an actual immigrant.
I actually came here on a boat.
That shapes a lot of
how I think and who I am.
People think today,
"Oh, I can't get ahead.
It's really hard."
Yeah, damn right it's really
hard, and it should be hard.
Entrepreneurship
is the great equalizer.
It's not about
who your parents are.
It's not about your color.
It's not about you sex.
It's not about your religion.
You know, business
doesn't really care.
Business only cares about
the value that you add.
I'm proud of
the success I've had,
but only in the sense
that it justifies
the sacrifice from my parents.
To work that hard
and go through that much pain,
and then for me to squander
it and not do something
with my life ?? that would've
been undeserving for them.
Hi.
I'm Mark Bernstein.
I'm from San Francisco,
and I'm the founder
and C. E. O. of MealEnders.
We're seeking $350,000
for 8% of our company.
Sharks, it happens all the time.
We say we're gonna
control our weight,
but the next thing we know,
we're going for seconds
and even thirds.
We know overeating is bad,
but it's hard to
control ourselves sometimes.
Until now.
MealEnders are a totally new
approach to weight management.
Signaling lozenges that
combine behavioral psychology
and sensory science to help you
beat overeating,
master portion control,
and curb snacking.
Each MealEnder has two layers ??
an outer reward layer
which provides
a measured dose of dessert
to cue the end of a meal
and satisfy snack cravings.
The inner cooling and tingling
core clears your palette
and transitions your focus
away from eating
until your natural
fullness signals kick in.
This unique formula rewards
and then resets your taste buds,
freeing you from the desire
to over?indulge,
all without drugs
or harmful stimulants.
So, Sharks,
give MealEnders a try.
Take control
and get over overeating.
I have some samples
for you to try.
Yeah, let's try it.
So, the product is designed
to dissolve in your mouth.
No chewing, or...
No chewing?
?No chewing.
So, there's different
flavors here?
Different flavors ??
chocolate mint, mocha,
citrus, and cinnamon.
?Thank you.
?You're probably not gonna
want to have more than one.
?I have to tell you, it's deli??
?It's really...
?It tastes good.
?Delicious chocolate.
But wait till you get to the ??
the active taste layer.
?Getting there.
?How many calories?
15 calories,
2 grams of sugar.
I'm getting
to the hard candy.
What you're gonna
start to experience
is this cooling and tingling.
And there's a small percentage
of the population that, uh...
I actually got a tingle
through my body.
I feel ?? I feel
the cooling core,
and all of a sudden ?? Barbara,
you look very attractive!
[ Laughter ]
Give me a kiss.
?Ew!
?Ew!
I just feel
warm and fuzzy.
Oh, it's burning
a little.
Well, hopefully
that's tingling.
?It's like a chilly...
?It leaves kind of a funky taste
on your tongue.
?Well, remember, the obje??
Which, at this point,
is making me not want
to put anything else
in my mouth...
?Exactly.
?... because my tongue feels
funny, and it's like it kills
your taste buds, right?
Well, some people
love the taste.
It's getting
really strong now.
?We've only had...
?It's getting really bad.
?Yeah, it's uncomfortable.
?It's like a bad date.
At the beginning,
she's wonderful.
This is the end of the date,
and I really hate her.
Cuban: Yeah, she's sticking
that thing in your mouth,
and it's like when
you brush your teeth
and she's got morning breath.
Let me tell you how it works,
but I want to tell you
one data point.
We've been in the market
for a year and a half.
We've had less than 2% returns.
We have 100% satisfaction
guarantee.
What's your sales
in a year and a half?
$1.4 million.
?You've done $1.4 million!
?Where are you selling?
Yeah, only on our website
and on Amazon.
What can you sell
this for online?
So, it depends on
what quantity you buy it in ??
anywhere from
$16.95 for one bag,
and if you buy in quantity
on a continuity plan,
it goes down to $8.99.
?It's pretty pricey,
but you know what
I like about it?
I sat here trying to think,
"What would I like to eat
right now to get rid of
that bad taste?"
And I couldn't
think of a single thing.
Right.
And that's a cool little trick
for people who like
to overeat.
Are you a scientist?
What's going on?
?I am not a scientist.
?How did you create this?
I am someone who
needed the product.
I started going to the doctor
every year as I got older,
which I'm sure many of you
might have experienced.
So, doctor would look at
one number and say,
"Why don't you lose 10 pounds?"
So I became more conscious
of my own eating,
and I experienced
that my problem was stopping.
And so I started looking for
some product that would
help me stop.
And I had the idea, and I said,
"Boy, if somebody could develop
something like that,
that would be a great business."
So I went and engaged
the leading food?development
company in the country.
Mark, how much weight
did you lose on this?
I lost 15 pounds.
And you've kept it off?
Yeah, and for me,
it's mindfulness.
Okay, tell me what
the customers are saying.
So, we did a test with
a third?party testing arm,
and the results there came back
better than we had hoped.
Over 75% stopped eating sooner,
avoided snacking,
and lost weight.
So you're not ?? you know,
so you could've...
We've had 6,000 reorders,
21% of our...
But does it have to
taste like that?
Well, everyone's
taste is different.
There's a reason why you walk
into a restaurant...
21% of your people reordered,
is what you're saying?
So far.
Greiner:
How much have you invested?
My family has,
uh, $200,000 in it.
Anybody else, or do we
have any other investors?
Yeah, we've done
a convertible note round,
and we've raised,
uh, $1.1 million.
?Ooh!
?Wow!
?Wow.
?Including my money.
Have you made a profit
from the very beginning
till now, at all?
Uh, we haven't been running
the business to run a profit.
Over the last few months, we've
had some profitable months,
but basically we're putting
everything back.
?How much did you ??
?We're trying to grow
the top line, because
we know that the power...
So, you're reinvesting
in advertising?
We're now doing
significant advertising.
Specifically, what were
your sales last month?
$170,000.
And this month will be close
to $175,000 or north of there.
Okay. And what have you spent
on advertising per month?
Probably, uh, about
half ?? half of that.
Half of that number?
?Wow.
?Wow.
?Wow.
?Or a little bit less.
What we're doing is ??
But still,
anything close, right?
21% reordering
is horrible.
It's horrific.
This should be viral.
Well, we think it is
starting to get viral.
No, it can't.
It's not viral if you have to
spend half your revenue
in advertising.
Look, we're a brand?new company
that no one's ever heard of.
No, you're not.
You're 18 months in,
and you have over
a million dollars in sales.
Well, we didn't start
advertising till later.
This should be the most
viral product ever.
If just one person
loses 15 pounds,
what are they gonna do?
They're gonna
get asked by everybody,
"What did you do?
What did you do?
What did you do," right?
I ?? I think you've
got a good idea.
I see what you're
trying to accomplish.
But you don't have
the solution yet.
I'm out.
Everybody in the world
wants to be rich,
and everybody in the world
wants to be thin.
But very few people
want to put the effort in.
So, when you have
a trigger point,
I think it really helps.
And I think you're
really on to something.
Here's what I don't
like about it.
It's kind of in the supplement,
diet kind of business.
You're gonna spend
a fortune to get the word out,
and then one day, there's
a hot new thing out there.
I don't like
that business.
I wish you all the best,
but I think you're gonna burn
a lot of money
to get to scale.
I'm out.
Can I share a couple
of facts with you?
One, the scale
of this problem is enormous.
Yeah, we know that,
but that's not the challenge.
Mark, let me take
a stab at it.
?Okay.
?You know, this is the first
weight?reduction product that's
ever come on to "Shark Tank"
and not been just
torn to shreds.
Yeah, true.
You didn't make claims
that you couldn't support.
You gave us the theory
behind the product.
I buy into it.
I personally don't like
the cooling, tingling core.
It's that simple,
and for me to give you $350,000,
I got to like the product.
And I just don't think
I'm sticking another one
of those things
in my mouth again.
And for that reason
and that reason only, I'm out.
Herjavec:
Lori, what are you gonna do?
I didn't like it either,
actually.
I wish you good luck,
but for me,
this isn't a product that
I feel very confident about.
So for that reason,
I'm out.
Barbara,
what are you doing?
You know what?
My experience on my tongue
was terrific,
and psychologically, I get it.
I'm amazed at your sales,
but you've infused the business
with a lot of cash,
and I think your
just getting started
is gonna take too much money
to make this enough.
We actually have people
who are interested in investing.
So because of those reasons,
although I love
your product, I'm out.
Okay.
?Thanks, Mark.
?Good luck, Mark.
Thanks, guys.
They are celebrities.
They're thin, they're fit,
they have trainers.
Not everybody has that.
And this is a product
that can help people who don't,
perhaps, go on
"Dancing with the Stars."
Mark, what do you
think about Kevin
on "Dancing with the Stars"?
I would love it.
You would lose 25 pounds
like that.
You've got it,
and I'm gonna kick your ass.
[ Laughs ]
Biggest thing?
What?
The biggest thing
we need ?? energy.
Energy.
Push?ups?
Mm!
Let's do this,
baby!
Yo!
?I want Mark's.
?Yeah, I'll swap with you.
Are these each a slice
of the billboard?
Yeah, so, a typical billboard
is around, like, 14x48 feet.
So, it's as big
as this room, almost.
How did you get to this?
Where ?? where'd you come from?
After college, I moved
to El Salvador and I was working
with a non?profit down there
in a small fishing village.
And a buddy of mine showed me
a tote bag that was actually
made out of a billboard.
And he was like,
"We use this as roofing."
They were using it
as actual like shelter,
and we were down there
surfing...
?Wow.
?A billboard.
...and my buddy said, "Let's
make a surfboard bag out of it."
I didn't know where
to find a sewer,
and I found
somebody across the street
that, you know, could sew up...
Car upholstery.
...car upholstery.
And I took
my surfboard and said,
"Can you help us make a bag?"
And from there, we made a bag,
and our first retailer store...
Our friends loved it.
... yeah, our first
retailer store that we actually
got into was Patagonia stores.
Wow.
So, we're at Patagonia stores
in the U. S.
and Patagonia stores
in Japan.
Who takes them down?
Is there...
So, the outdoor marketing
company takes it down.
So, what we do is
we have supply contracts
with the two largest
outdoor marketing companies.
And do you have exclusive
contracts with them?
We do.
Okay.
Corcoran: How many billboards
do those two contracts
obligate you to buy?
You're committed
in advance?
They're actually free.
We don't buy them.
We don't buy them.
?Oh, free!
?So, the big thing for us is
we now gave them
an opportunity
to cost?save
on their business.
At the same time, they promote
it to their, like, PR side.
But you have to
transport it, right?
So, transporting
the material from us,
we get about 1,000 billboards,
and it costs around $200.
What is the cost on a knapsack,
a carrier bag, a wallet?
Well, what you have, Robert ??
that's our surfboard bag.
That was our main product
we started with.
That costs us $12 to make.
We wholesale for $40,
retail for $80.
To make a wallet ?? that's our
best?selling product ??
it's $2, and we wholesale
for $12.50.
Guys, how do you
communicate the message?
'Cause the reality is,
if you just look at that,
you have no idea
that it's a billboard.
And then, when you just
feel it, you know,
if you didn't know
it was a billboard,
you'd be like,
"What's up with this thing?
It doesn't feel right."
So, the biggest part,
I feel, about Rareform,
is they love
the story behind it.
And that's the biggest thing
we have is trouble
is telling that story
to our new...
Right, and that's
the big question.
?Who's telling it?
Who's telling it for you?
So, on our website, you know,
we tell it on our website ??
it's pretty easy.
But in?store, we have
to come out with
the best displays possible
to help tell that story ??
any kind of
point?of?purchases displays.
Well, I don't see anything
there. What do you guys do?
So, for us right now,
like, for example,
these are in every Quicksilver
store ?? a wallet display.
And these turn great for us.
What are your sales?
That's a great question.
So far...
I think it's a very good
question.
I like it a lot, actually.
Yeah, it is
a good one.
We've done $1.1 million
in sales.
Over what period of time?
This is our third year
in business.
So, what did you do
in the last 12 months?
Last 12 months,
we did $700,000.
But you guys are
making money then, right?
Because your margins are decent,
and $700,000 in sales.
No, so, last year,
we actually took a loss.
?You did?
?Yeah, we took a $130,000 loss.
?Why?
?Why?
?Damn!
?Because we were
manufacturing products
still in the U. S.,
so it wasn't until
the last four months
that we moved to Mexico
and have cut our costs down.
So a 70% mark?up.
Right, so you've got
70% margins.
Yes.
So last month,
you should've made money.
Yeah, we did. Actually, it was
a turning point in our company.
?How much did you make?
?Uh, I think it was like, 5K.
?Yeah!
?Yeah!
Where'd you get the money
to absorb the loss?
So, in the beginning,
I put in $60,000,
where you could
market them that way,
then you have a unique,
sustainable position.
But a $3 million value
and not having that in place ??
I don't see it.
I'm out.
Okay, guys, that leaves me.
I like you guys.
You're grinders.
But the biggest problem
with your deal is the valuation
and the fact you don't
own much equity anymore.
You're not worth $3 million.
I don't care what
other people paid for it.
You're not profitable yet.
Um, here's the only way
to do this.
I'm gonna offer you
$300,000 as debt,
8% interest rate, 36 months.
That's three years.
That's enough to prove out
your model and get sales going,
and you're gonna
give me 10% equity,
which you offered
when you walked in the Tank.
That's the only deal here,
and it's the only one
you've got.
You got to make a decision.
What do you want to do?
Narrator:
Four Sharks are out.
