Hello, Sharks!
My name's Alec Avedissian.
And I'm his
younger brother, Aric.
We're from
Ventura County, California,
and our company is Rareform.
We're seeking $300,000
for a 10% stake in our company.
Imagine you're sitting
in traffic on the freeway,
and you look up
and you see
a colorful, bold
billboard advertisement.
In L. A. alone, there are
over 10,000 billboards,
and those billboards
are typically swapped out
every four to six weeks
and then thrown away.
What you might not know,
though, is that billboards
are actually made of
a heavy?duty,
durable waterproof vinyl ??
the perfect material
for making a bag,
but bad for our landfills.
This is where
Rareform comes in.
We intercept that material
before it reaches the landfill,
and turn it into one?of?a?kind
bags and accessories.
Out of one billboard alone,
we can get 1,000 wallets,
10 bulk surfboard bags,
or 100 unique backpacks.
Our customers love
that they're truly getting
one?of?a?kind products that are
helping sustain our environment.
Sharks, we were lucky enough
to get our hands on a billboard
from our favorite show...
[ Laughter ]
...and we turned it into
products just for you guys.
We'd love for you
to check them out.
So, Robert, we got you
a surfboard bag.
Oh, thank you!
Wow, very cool!
This one says, "Only
the strong will survive" on it.
?I like that. Thank you.
?Thank you.
Lori, look at this!
?Really cool.
?It's really cool!
For example, like Aric
was saying on the surfbag,
it was costing us $28.
?And what's it costing now?
?Now, $12.
?$12.
?And your wholesale
for the surfbag is...
?$40.
and Aric put in $20,000.
I put in $20,000.
Do you have
any other investors?
Yeah, we first raised around
$200,000 prior to revenue.
From family and friends,
or from whom?
Uh. from family
and friends, yeah.
What did
you value that at?
What was the value of business
after they put the $200,000 in?
Uh, I want
to say it was at ??
I'm not totally sure
on that number.
You should know that.
?$105,000.
?How much equity did they get?
?They got 30% equity.
?How much do you have?
?They got 30%?
?And then, you guys split
the 70% equally?
Right now, Alec and I own
around 40% of the company.
So, the value of the business
was $600,000 on that.
We actually just raised
another round,
and it was at
a $2.5 million valuation.
Oh!
$2.5 million for this?
How much did you raise?
$150,000.
Wow.
You're asking me to give you
$300,000 for 10%
impugning a $3 million value.
No chance in hell
it's worth $3 million.
Another big aspect
for our business
that we haven't talked on
is that we have
a corporate business.
We just got a first P. O.
from one of the largest
theme parks in the world.
Um, here's my thing.
You don't own enough stock.
I feel like at this point,
you've sold off a chunk of
your business again and again.
That concerns me.
All right, I don't
think there's enough room
for another person to come in
and take a bite.
So, I'm out.
All right.
Appreciate it.
It's your personal touch
that has a lot to do
with what's going on,
and that's very hard to scale.
And you're not asking
for $100,000
for 30% of your business.
You're asking for a valuation
for a real company
that needs to grow
into very significant profits
in order for me
to get my money back.
?Yeah.
?So, for those reasons, I'm out.
Thank you for your time.
Listen, you've done
$1.1 million in three years,
so nobody can scoff at that.
That's really good.
And I do love that the, um,
environmentally?friendly
piece of it, which is great.
You're recycling these.
But, because it's ever?changing,
you're never gonna have
two of the same twice.
It's a bad thing, because if
I see yours and I love it,
and I want one, I can't
get one because they're unique.
And so, for those reasons,
I'm out.
If part of your deal
in getting these billboards
was some kind of a license
or a contract
Kevin is Aric and Alec's
last chance for a deal
for their bags made from
recycled billboards, Rareform.
I'm gonna offer you
$300,000 as debt,
8% interest rate, 36 months.
That's three years.
That's enough to prove out
your model and get sales going,
and you're gonna give me
10% equity,
which you offered when
you walked in the Tank.
That's the only deal here,
and it's the only you've got.
You got to make a decision.
What do you want to do?
What if we were to do it ??
just structure it as a ??
an equity deal instead?
And what if we moved
the percentage?
It is an equity deal.
I'm getting 10%.
15%, yeah.
But I'm loaning you the money.
You are not ?? guys, you're just
not worth 3 million bucks.
You're also very quick to give
away stock ?? bam, like that.
That's scary.
For us, I mean,
we didn't have any other way
to start the business.
For us...
You know, if it was
straight equity,
I would ask for about
40% of your company, okay?
And if you do that,
you simply don't own enough
to get up and go to work.
I don't want to do that.
That's not good for me.
It's useless.
Once I loan you money, I'm at
risk, do you understand that?
I've got to get it back.
I don't want you to fail.
No, we understand it.
I think the big thing for me
is the balloon payment.
I think, I mean, I would like
to have it, you know,
kicked back like, five months.
When you borrow money,
my friend,
you got to pay it back one day.
How much do you
need the cash today?
I mean, right now,
we're at a place
where we do need the cash,
'cause we're ??
If you need the cash,
it's a great offer.
It's not a balloon payment.
You're paying it along the way.
Everybody's gonna
charge you that.
I'm not gonna do something
that hurts the business
that I'm trying
to support.
?Yeah.
?That's stupid money.
I'm not stupid.
I know how to lend money.
Corcoran:
I think he's being overpaid.
You just think about that,
young man.
He gets a kicker at the end,
he takes a chunk
of your business ?? 10%.
You don't own
a lot already.
And he's being overpaid
on the interest,
even though he's positioning it
as a great deal.
You think 8%
is being overpaid?
Yes.
Barbara, why don't you
make an offer
if you're so generous?
?I'm not!
?It's the only offer, Barbara.
What's going through
your heads right now?
I think that, you know,
the 8% interest is pretty high.
What if we were to get it
somewhere down 5%?
It's not high.
I ?? are you kidding?
Have you tried to factor
any of your receivables yet?
He says he does.
Yeah, we have a factor.
What are you getting for it?
6%.
I don't believe it.
I'd like to see those terms.
?If we show you those terms ??
?I do not believe you, actually.
?We'll show you the terms.
?There you go.
?There's your counter.
?So you're saying that you can
go do the very same thing
at 6% right now.
?Yeah.
?Zero interest.
You're just not worth it yet.
No, thanks.
What are you gonna do?
What do you feel
in your gut?
By the way, I didn't say ??
and you probably know this ??
I'm extremely valuable.
I'm Mr. Wonderful.
?You got to deal with him.
?Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Let me get the shovel.
Ask any of my entrepreneurs,
any of them.
They ?? I am Mr. Wonderful
to them.
Uh...
Let's do it.
Wow, you're gonna
regret that one.
?Hey!
?What?
Okay, guys. I think
you made a wise decision.
I'm not kidding.
Thank you.
Remember, you're gonna have to
look at that face every day.
Congratulations, guys.
Good luck.
Whoo!
All right!
Whoo!
Alec: We're still learning
how to run the business
more efficiently,
more effectively,
and having somebody
with that wisdom
that we can call on
and talk with
is really just gonna be
a game?changer for us.
And he seems like
a great man, too.
I kind of want
to party with him.
Yeah.
I want to rub
that bald head of his.
Just rub that thing.
[ Laughs ]
