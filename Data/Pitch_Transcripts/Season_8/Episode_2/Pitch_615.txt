Hi, Sharks,
I'm Sebastian.
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Raul.
Both: And we are the creators
of The Lapel Project.
We're seeking $150,000
for 20% of our company.
Sharks, we have created a
game?changing fashion accessory
that will revolutionize
the fashion world,
disrupting
the tuxedo industry,
leaving them sleepless
at night.
You know, special events ??
They do happen all the time.
Proms, weddings, formals,
black?tie events ??
They happen
across the globe.
Cost you, if not hundreds,
thousands of dollars,
for something that
you'd only wear once,
collecting dust
in your closet?
And renting for one night
burns a hole in your pocket.
You know, it just causes
such an inconvenience,
getting fitted,
returning, picking up.
I mean, who's got time
for all of that?
No one does.
Introducing...
The Lapel Project.
The Lapel Project allows
you to customize
You see, Sebastian
is standing here
with a beautiful
burgundy suit,
which we're
bringing over,
and we've
chosen our top seller,
which is just a standard
satin black lapel, okay?
Simply follow the lines
of the suit lapel,
fold over the excess,
and in seconds,
we've created
a fashion accessory.
Wow, it actually looks
really good.
It does.
We've created
a one?of?a?kind tuxedo.
Ba?bam!
Sharks, this has
no predecessors.
This is completely new.
This is the evolution
of men's fashion.
I lo??
Since you're dressed
to invest...
let's make a deal.
?I like it.
?You want to try it?
Yeah, you got to bring us
the samples.
Sebastian's got
some cuts of lapels,
which we've made
for all of you guys.
?Okay, let's try the ??
?Save the skulls for me.
?Try the skulls.
?I want the skulls.
How much is it, Sebastian?
Our cost
is between $5 to $8.
Both:
And what do you sell it for?
We sell it between
$49 to $100.
?Whoa!
?How do you sell it?
We sell it right now
in one brick?and?mortar
store in South Florida.
Together:
That's it?
?That's it.
?What about the online business?
We haven't gone there yet,
and that's why we're here.
We need the money
to set up our e?commerce.
This is a brand?new product
that no one knows about.
?Hang on.
?We need to inform the public.
How did you find this one store
in South Florida?
That's my store.
I grew up in the business.
I was gonna say
you own it.
I grew up
in the business.
?So, what are your sales?
?Right now, from six months,
I started doing
the manufacturing ?? $16,000.
Do you have some kind
of a patent?
How are you gonna
protect this?
I have
a patent pending, yes, sir.
On the design patent?
I have a utility patent
on the function.
No, a utility patent
on the function
of converting a suit
into a tuxedo.
Is your idea
that it's a gag gift?
?No, absolutely not.
?Absolutely not.
?Oh, come on.
?Oh, are you kidding me?
?To proms and stuff?
?I see that Kevin ??
Robert, Robert, neckwear sales
have dropped 25%.
I mean,
I see the fun gag.
Sebastian, what guy out there
is gonna put this on
and go
to a formal event?
Me.
It all depends
on the personality.
?Me!
?You're at Palm Beach.
?Me!
?But you won't put on a suit.
Guys ??
I'm gonna walk into
the White House like this.
You would never do that!
In a heartbeat.
?You would not.
?In a heartbeat.
Robert, my target demographic
is ages between 13
to young adults ?? 35.
People who need to go
to prom ??
Renting will cost you anywhere
between $200, $250
of used,
ill?fitting clothing.
You guys own
this company?
I'm gonna wear this
to my wedding now.
Garcia: There's never been
a third option.
There's an instant demand
for this.
I'm on the front lines
of this business.
I deal with people on
a daily basis with that dilemma.
"Do I buy, or do I rent?"
I show them this product,
and they're in complete
amazement and awe.
Sebastian, you've got
a lot of energy.
You've got a lot of energy.
You're kind of like
one of those guys
I'm worried you're just
gonna burst into flames.
Cuban: That's okay.
So, hold ?? hold on, Sebastian.
Let me ask Sebastian ??
Are you a pain ?? Are you a pain
in the ass to work with?
Absolutely not.
[ Laughter ]
I have a vision in this.
I see this.
?But you had to think about it.
?Sebastian! Sebas??
Some of my employees
may say differently.
?Sebastian.
?Yes, sir?
?Business right here.
?Yes, sir.
Okay, I love it. I mean, the
things I could do with sports,
you know, with kids,
the online component.
I have Amazon exclusives
just in my name,
where they would
turn it around.
It would crush it.
So, what I'll do ??
I'm gonna make you an offer ??
150K for 30%.
O'Leary: Wait a minute.
Let me tell you
where I stand on this.
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.
Attention on me.
?Yes, sir.
?Attention on me.
You want to get
other offers, don't you?
?Wait! Wait!
?I'm gonna share my thoughts.
?Yes.
?Hold on, hold on.
You're gonna lose the deal,
Sebastian.
?I'm not losing the deal.
?You are gonna lose the deal.
If you want to, you know, mess
around with these guys.
Don't you want to hear
other offers?
John: Hold on.
Hold on one second.
You know, you sold $16,000
worth, and I'll tell you why.
People love you, right?
You sold it out of your store.
Your store's probably
been there.
It's probably a mainstay
in the community.
People know where
they need to go,
and you are
the best salesman ever.
?Thank you.
?You really are.
But in all
my fashion companies,
we used to always make coats
that you can flip inside?out.
So obviously, reversibles.
People generally don't use
these functionalities.
I have a history of not seeing
these type of things utilized,
even though
they may be purchased.
So I'm out.
I respect your decision.
I respect your experience.
Obviously a lot more
than I have.
?Greiner: Wait, wait, wait.
?But I made you an offer!
I get ?? I get the whole thing
about the lapels
that you're wearing for people
who can't afford to,
don't want to buy a tux.
But I do not like
the look of this.
What?!
As a woman, I would
not be digging this.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Guys, either we're doing
a deal, or we're not.
So, guys, it's
a little sobering
that the fashion guru
and the only woman Sharkette
concerned about this ??
Well, what if I was a kid,
and I was going to the prom?
I got to get this girl
to go out with me.
Mark, we're gonna
take your deal, sir.
We're gonna take
your deal, Mark.
Thank you!
?[ Laughs ]
?There you have it.
Thank you very much.
?My pleasure.
?Pleasure.
?Yeah.
?Yeah.
?We'll crush it.
?Thank you.
?All right, guys.
?Let's do it.
Thank you for your time.
?Thank you, guys.
?Good luck, you guys.
?Good luck, guys.
[ Both laugh ]
Cuban:
I'm telling you when I take my
son to a wedding or something
and you put the little
baby suit he has on
and you put the bride and groom
on there, right?
Yeah, and then he goes
to the bathroom,
and he comes out
looking like this.
Are you sure your son's
gonna like that?
?So what? So what?
?[ Laughs ]
That's another use.
We're gonna charge extra
for that.
It's actually a testament
that you can really do ??
If you work hard
towards your dreams
and you work towards it
every single day,
no matter what little,
small step you do,
but you do one small step every
day, you can make it happen.
You just got to
believe in it.
