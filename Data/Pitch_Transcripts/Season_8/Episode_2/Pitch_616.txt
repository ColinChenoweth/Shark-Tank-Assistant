Hi, Sharks.
My name is Leslie Pierson.
I'm from Seattle, Washington,
Leslie, I'll get
the ball rolling.
I think
it's a great product.
?Okay.
?Congratulations.
?Thank you.
?450K doing all this.
You're a force of nature.
?Wow.
But in terms of trying to take
a force of nature
Just to give ?? Leslie, I'll
give you some leverage.
But I'll tell you, Leslie,
you'll have to tell me now
because I can see
what this is like here.
Leslie, do you want to hear
another offer or not?
Lori, in the adhesive space,
who's the number?one maker?
I'd like you to answer now.
?Lori. Lori.
?Wait, wait, do not do that
because it'll give you
some leverage.
Don't do that.
Don't do that.
?Your packaging...
?Yeah.
?...needs a lot of help.
?I'm open.
You know what?
Leslie, you either have to take
my offer or it may go away.
Leslie, do you want to hear
other offers or not?
Narrator:
Two Sharks are out.
Leslie has one offer
on the table from Lori
for her magnetic picture hangers
GoodHangups.
But she may jeopardize the deal
?Leslie, I'm gonna give you ??
?Leslie! Leslie! Leslie!
I'll give you $100,000 for 15%.
?Whoa!
?$100,000 for 15%.
I want to take this to ShurTech,
the people who make Duck Tape.
I want to give you
some leverage.
I want you to squeeze her down.
I'm gonna do this favor for you.
Leslie, do you think that's
a nice partner to have ??
someone who wants to squeeze
a woman's head?
I don't want to see you
taken advantage of.
?Wow!
?Really, it's not.
Okay, Leslie,
you got three offers.
John:
Hold on one second.
I absolutely know
that Lori
is great for this deal,
of course, right?
I didn't think about
that point with Shutterfly.
The important thing,
Leslie,
is that when my entrepreneurs
do a deal with me, they get me.
I'm the one that's on the phone
with them.
I'm the one that's doing
the designing of the packaging
Leslie, do not give up 20%.
That's very foolish.
But I do not ever speak
for what they do,
as they shouldn't speak
for what I do.
?Right. Exactly.
?I can only tell you what I do.
Daymond will do it for 15%.
I'll do it for 10%.
?But I love him.
?This is the Shark Tank, Leslie.
?Reject his offer.
?This happens in the Shark Tank.
Just because ??
All right, 20% is
a bit much equity for me.
?Way too much.
?What's your counter?
So my counter is would you be
open to $100,000 loan for 10%?
If I don't repay you
in the first year, you get 20%.
You got it.
?Done.
?Done.
Whoo!
[ Laughs ]
Leslie, you made me an offer
I couldn't refuse.
We will be
a dynamite team.
We will.
We really will.
We're gonna take this
to be huge.
I'm gonna ?? Anyway, bye.
Bye!
[ Laughter ]
Whoo!
Oh, my God!
I did it, did it, did it!
She's just
way too mellow.
Yeah, she doesn't have
any energy.
La, la, la, la, la!
Yes!
