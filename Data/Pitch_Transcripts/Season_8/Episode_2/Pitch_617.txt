My name is Nick Massie.
I live in Truckee, California.
I'm the Chief Culinary Ninja
at Ice Age Meals.
And I'm seeking $1 million in
exchange for 10% of my company.
$1 million?
$1 million.
Whoo!
To debunk the myths you've been
fed about nutrition
and show you the truth
about food is my mission.
[ Chuckles ]
To illustrate this,
I've written a poem.
This is called
"The Ice Age is Here."
It's the diet of the cavemen
who surely did eat it,
and if you try it out,
you'll be tempted to cheat it.
Thanks to the cardboard box,
cooking skills
have been blunted.
But cavemen didn't have
this problem, why?
Because they gathered
and hunted.
The obesity train is on a roll.
The brakes are broken.
It's out of control.
Time is now more valuable
than ever.
We've got planning and shopping
and cooking and dishes.
It's like we need a genie to
come grant our meal?prep wishes.
Now, I don't have a shiny lamp.
What I've got is a simple
cardboard box with ice
that brings meals to your door
at a reasonable price.
So come with me,
and the goods you'll witness ??
Let Paleo Nick be your guide
to culinary fitness.
[ Laughter ]
Wow.
I've got some samples
I'd like to hand out.
This is our butternut squash
lasagna.
It's our top seller.
Thank you.
Oh!
?That's delicious.
?That's great.
?Really good.
?Very good.
?Thank you.
?Is this your recipe?
This is.
Greiner: You said you're
the culinary ninja.
?Massie: Culinary ninja.
?That's really good.
You are the chef for all
of the meals that you ship?
?This is great.
?I am.
So, tell us about you. And this
is delicious, by the way.
Well, Nick, before you get
going into it,
will you hand us the packaging
so we can look at
the nutritional...?
Massie:
Yeah, let me do that.
How many calories
is in this?
All of our meals
are around 500 calories.
?So this one plate is 500?
?This one meal is 500?
No, that's about 1/3 portion
right there.
What is the Paleo diet?
The Paleo diet is meat
and vegetables, nuts and seeds,
some fruit, little starch,
and no sugar.
All of our meals
are $9.99.
?Okay, so this is $9.99.
?Yeah.
What does it cost you
to make this?
That cost me $2.95.
Herjavec: How long have you been
selling the product?
The product has been selling
since August of last year.
What have the sales been?
$1.5 million.
Wow.
What did you do
this past month?
We did $130,000.
And you are delivering
all over the country.
All 50 states. Correct.
What's your minimum ??
How many meals?
So, if you want to buy
12 meals,
you pay $120
plus $20 shipping.
Okay, so, $140.
Why is that worth
$10 million?
Before Kevin
asks his question ??
Why is that worth
$10 million?
Before we get to that,
I want to know a little bit
about your story.
Yeah, let me tell you
my story.
This was delicious.
This is delicious, right?
?Yeah, it's really good.
?You went to culinary school.
I did go
to culinary school.
From there, I got a degree in
hotel and restaurant management.
And a minor in Spanish.
[ Laughter ]
Which makes perfect sense.
I ultimately got a job
at Aspen, Colorado,
where I eventually became
the chef for Lance Armstrong.
So from 2008 to 2011 ??
So, it's your fault.
[ Chuckles ]
No, I'm ?? I have
nothing to do with that.
My first day, he was doing some
CrossFit training at the time,
and I was inspired.
Did my first workout
October 30, 2008,
never looked back, and started
meshing my two passions.
Do you have a deal with CrossFit
to use their name?
Yes and no.
You guys ready for this?
Yesterday they flew me
to Santa Cruz
to meet with
their chief operating officer,
the head of their business.
So is this why you're valuing
the business where you're at?
Correct.
Because based on
this future business
that you think
you're gonna have?
Do you actually have a written
agreement with CrossFit
that gives you the right
to market under their name?
I don't have a written
agreement.
We would essentially be
their co?packer.
We don't have the details.
?Why's it worth $10 million?
So you're gonna ?? Wait,
I want to ask a question.
Have they given you an offer,
though, that is firm?
They have ?? This is very recent
and very fast?moving.
Herjavec: So, Nick, let's just
leave that alone
'cause it's very preliminary.
?Right.
Talk to me a little bit
about the story, in your mind,
of how you got to this value
of $10 million.
The valuation ??
I mean, I see right now ??
This is
a $1?billion business.
?That's the answer?
?What's a $1?billion business?
Yes.
What, this is gonna be
a $1?billion business?
?Yes.
?Uh, Ice Age Meals?
Yeah.
Why?
Because [groans] I mean...
"Why is it gonna be
a $1?billion business?"
Cuban: Please
tell us this one.
I mean, so, we modeled this
after an existing company.
Which one?
Amy's.
You guys know Amy's Organics?
?Yeah, of course.
?Right.
They started in 1988.
So they're 28 years into it.
But Amy's sells
into grocery stores.
Yeah.
Are you planning on putting this
into grocery stores
or just doing
direct?to?consumer?
Yeah, all across the board.
I can do that same model.
I know I can, but with meat.
They're 100% vegetarian.
?Nick, I just ??
?You've studied Amy's, then.
Yeah, yes.
You've really moved me, and I
want to read a poem, okay?
?Oh!
?Oh, no.
I really want to ??
I want to read a poem,
and I've written it for you.
?That's a special moment.
?It doesn't happen very often.
"In cash I know because
I like to watch it flow.
When I ask valuation,
I want no hesitation.
Are you worth $10 million?
Hell, no."
[ Laughter ]
?Kevin.
?Damn, Kevin.
How is it possible that any
of these other four Sharkettes
are gonna figure out
to do a deal with you
where they have to own
more than 100%?
They're gonna believe in me.
?Nick ??
?That's the answer?
Yeah.
?I'm out.
?Okay.
Nick, I love the story.
I love the name.
?How is this still gonna happen?
?I love everything.
?We're getting there.
?I love the questions.
I hate the valuation.
?You don't say, Robert?
?I know you do.
?You've got a problem.
?But you love me.
Robert, you love me, don't you?
I find $10 million
a little rich.
?How about $1 million's rich?
?I do love you, Nick!
Yes! Whoo!
?Whoo!
?[ Laughs ]
This right here ?? Listen.
Corporate wellness program.
Huh? We just planted
one of these freezers.
A guy shows up.
?Can I just tell you?
?Yeah.
If I was ever in a meeting
and we were talking business
and you came back to me
and said, "Huh?!"
it would be over
right there.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm out.
Are you nervous
right now?
You guys ??
I'm not nervous.
?You're not nervous at all?
?I love all you guys except ??
I mean ??
?Wait a second, Nick.
?[ Laughs ]
?There's the, "Huh?!"
Just because I tell
the truth.
I'm the only Shark
telling the truth here.
Herjavec:
So, Nick, I love the story.
I love the name.
Hate the value.
It's insane.
Ohh!
I'm out.
O'Leary:
Okay, Daymond.
Your poem, please.
?Oh, boy, here it comes.
?Another poem?
"Roses are red,
and I am black."
[ Laughter ]
"Your valuation was whack.
So I don't know how
to say this with tact.
I'm out."
Now there's only
one Shark left.
Lori, Lori, what are
you going to do?
Lori.
Greiner:
You know you came in here ??
You asked for a huge amount
of money.
I know.
I understand that.
Without having that paper
in your hand that said,
"I have
this $5 million deal."
?Even that. Too much.
?That's the problem.
It was just too high.
?I understand.
I'm out.
?Okay, guys.
?Congratulations.
?Thank you so much.
?Congratulations.
?Yeah, thank you. Thank you.
?Good luck.
Hey, hey?
Huh, huh, huh, huh?!
?Yeah.
?Huh?! Huh?!
But it's just the way
the guy is.
Come on, we're not all polished
and slick like you.
I'm certainly not polished.
Maybe slick,
but it's like rubbing your
fingers on a chalkboard.
It would have
driven me nuts.
