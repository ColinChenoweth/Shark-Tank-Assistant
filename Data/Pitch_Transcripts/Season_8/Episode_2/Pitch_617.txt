My name is Nick Massie.
I live in Truckee, California.
I'm the Chief Culinary Ninja
at Ice Age Meals.
Let Paleo Nick be your guide
to culinary fitness.
[ Laughter ]
Wow.
?Massie: Culinary ninja.
?That's really good.
You are the chef for all
of the meals that you ship?
?This is great.
?I am.
Well, Nick, before you get
going into it,
Massie:
Yeah, let me do that.
How many calories
is in this?
All of our meals
are around 500 calories.
?So this one plate is 500?
?This one meal is 500?
No, that's about 1/3 portion
right there.
What is the Paleo diet?
Herjavec: So, Nick, let's just
leave that alone
'cause it's very preliminary.
?Right.
Talk to me a little bit
about the story, in your mind,
of how you got to this value
of $10 million.
The valuation ??
I mean, I see right now ??
This is
a $1?billion business.
?That's the answer?
?What's a $1?billion business?
Yes.
What, this is gonna be
a $1?billion business?
?Yes.
?Uh, Ice Age Meals?
Yeah.
Why?
Because [groans] I mean...
"Why is it gonna be
a $1?billion business?"
Cuban: Please
tell us this one.
I mean, so, we modeled this
after an existing company.
Which one?
Amy's.
You guys know Amy's Organics?
?Yeah, of course.
?Right.
They started in 1988.
So they're 28 years into it.
But Amy's sells
into grocery stores.
Yeah.
Are you planning on putting this
into grocery stores
or just doing
direct?to?consumer?
Yeah, all across the board.
I can do that same model.
I know I can, but with meat.
They're 100% vegetarian.
?Nick, I just ??
?You've studied Amy's, then.
Yeah, yes.
?Nick ??
?That's the answer?
Yeah.
?I'm out.
?Okay.
Nick, I love the story.
I love the name.
?How is this still gonna happen?
?I love everything.
?We're getting there.
?I love the questions.
I hate the valuation.
?You don't say, Robert?
?I know you do.
?You've got a problem.
?But you love me.
Robert, you love me, don't you?
I find $10 million
a little rich.
?How about $1 million's rich?
?I do love you, Nick!
Yes! Whoo!
?Whoo!
?[ Laughs ]
This right here ?? Listen.
Corporate wellness program.
Huh? We just planted
one of these freezers.
A guy shows up.
?Can I just tell you?
?Yeah.
I mean ??
?Wait a second, Nick.
?[ Laughs ]
?There's the, "Huh?!"
Just because I tell
the truth.
I'm the only Shark
telling the truth here.
Herjavec:
So, Nick, I love the story.
I love the name.
Hate the value.
It's insane.
Ohh!
I'm out.
O'Leary:
Okay, Daymond.
Your poem, please.
?Oh, boy, here it comes.
?Another poem?
