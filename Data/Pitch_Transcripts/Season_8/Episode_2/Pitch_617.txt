Hi, Sharks.
My name is Leslie Pierson.
I'm from Seattle, Washington,
and my product is called
GoodHangups.
I'm looking for $100,000 for a
10% equity stake in my business.
Sharks, I have commitment
issues... with decorating!
I want to be free to hang things
on my wall.
But sometimes
I just can't fathom
putting one more hole
in my wall.
I've tried alternatives
like putties.
They don't work.
I've tried tacks and tape,
but they damaged
my treasured artwork.
Well, GoodHangups fixes
all of those hangups and more.
GoodHangups
is a revolutionary product
that turns your wall
into a magnet board.
They're super?easy to use.
Place the magnetic?receptive
sticker on the wall.
Place your art...
?Oh, Lord.
?Very attractive.
And add the magnets.
It's that easy.
Hmm!
O'Leary: Yes!
[ Laughter ]
They're removable and reusable,
and they work
on tons of surfaces,
like concrete, brick, tile,
wood, and textured walls.
So, Sharks, who wants to get
hung up on GoodHangups?
?Do you have any to pass out?
?I sure do!
[ Laughs ]
I like her 'cause she's
low?energy.
[ Chuckles ] That's what
everybody always says about me.
?Thank you.
?There you go, Lori.
Thank you.
Leslie, I take this off,
and I stick it
with the little magnetic piece
to the wall.
?Yeah.
?Does it damage the wall?
No, it won't damage your walls.
They're removable and reusable.
I have some that I've reused
many, many times.
They're really, really great.
It's an adhesive that's actually
sticking it, right?
It is adhesive.
Many people would just fold
a piece of Scotch tape in half
and get both adhesive sides.
?Isn't that the same effect?
Well, no, because
if you put that on the wall
and wait a week, you're actually
gonna get a stain.
Greiner:
You're gonna get a stain.
So, do you have a significantly
different adhesive?
Yes, we do.
Is part of your claim that
no matter what you put it on,
it's gonna remove it without
damage, even a month later?
Even a month later.
Even a year later.
What are your sales?
So, the product's been out
about a year,
and I've sold a little
over $450,000 in sales.
Good for you.
That's good.
?That's not bad.
?Thank you.
That's really good.
Where did you sell
your $450,000?
Over 50% has been on QVC.
I know.
I recognized this.
You've been on QVC?
You recognized me?
How did you come up
with this idea?
Well, I came up with it
because I have a 5?year?old
who is super?creative.
He was bringing home
tons of art.
The fridge was fully covered,
and I knew there had to be
a better way.
And literally, if there was
another solution on the market,
I would have bought it
and been done.
You wouldn't see me here
at all
because I just needed
to solve my problem.
So, of the $450,000 in sales,
what amount is QVC?
What amount is non?QVC?
Yeah, a little over half
is QVC.
The rest of it comes
from a combination
of either direct sales.
About 20%
come direct, retail.
?Which retailer?
?What retail are you in?
So, we're currently sold
in over 110 paper?source stores
nationwide.
What about Staples?
We're not there yet.
We'd love to be there.
Leslie, what does it sell for?
And what's your cost?
We sell these
in 8, 16, 40, and 100 pack.
What does the 8?pack
sell for?
The 8?pack sells for $14.99.
My cost of goods is $2.25.
Nice!
Landed here. I'm assuming
you make them offshore.
No, we are U. S.?made,
U. S. and imported parts.
What do you need
the money for today?
I'm a super?fan
of you guys.
I've watched you
for seven years,
and I feel like you've been
my silent partners on this.
Okay, enough sucking up.
[ Laughs ]
I know. I am.
So, I'm really here
for the strategic partnerships.
What element of strategy
do you need help with?
First off, opening up
larger big?box retailers.
The big thing is conveying
in a retail store
how this works, right?
Because you ??
Exactly.
This is my biggest challenge.
I'm not sure
the packaging does that.
Seeing it up there, it wasn't
clear what the benefit was.
I 100% agree there's opportunity
to tweak the packaging.
That is why I'm probably
the most nervous
about going in big?box stores
is that if it doesn't sell
through, I got one shot at it.
Leslie, I'll get
the ball rolling.
I think
it's a great product.
?Okay.
?Congratulations.
?Thank you.
?450K doing all this.
You're a force of nature.
?Wow.
But in terms of trying to take
a force of nature
and turn that into a company
and get through all
the blocking and tackling,
I don't think I'm the
best?suited person for that.
I'm out.
Mark is right.
You are a force of nature.
You have such an incredibly
pleasant personality,
and you have
all the right answers.
It's fantastic.
Look, when I was
a little kid,
somebody made me cut
between the lines
and they moved stuff up
on the wall and I messed it up
and the other kids
made fun of me.
It's a horrible memory.
?Aw.
?Ohh!
I'm just not the arts?crafts
kind of guy.
Not for me. I'm out.
So, I can see you have, like,
crazy drive, like I do.
And there is no force equal,
in my mind, to a woman
that's determined to rise.
So I'm gonna give you
an offer.
Oh, my gosh.
I'm gonna give you $100,000,
but it would be for 20%.
I think I can help you get
into Bed Bath &amp; Beyond
and Staples and all the places
where this needs to go.
You all have superpowers.
If there was actually
an opportunity
to get a super team
going...
?Lori is not enough for you?
?I'll tell you what I'll do.
Lori knows ?? She's Queen
of QVC, Queen of Retail.
Just to give ?? Leslie, I'll
give you some leverage.
But I'll tell you, Leslie,
you'll have to tell me now
because I can see
what this is like here.
Leslie, do you want to hear
another offer or not?
Lori, in the adhesive space,
who's the number?one maker?
I'd like you to answer now.
?Lori. Lori.
?Wait, wait, do not do that
because it'll give you
some leverage.
Don't do that.
Don't do that.
?Your packaging...
?Yeah.
?...needs a lot of help.
?I'm open.
You know what?
And that's
my sweet spot, so...
I'd like to make sure that
I hear all the offers first.
?Well...
?I want you to know
that I will not make a rash
decision when we're partners.
She is a sweet talker.
Wow!
You are good!
It's all smart stuff,
but do you feel I'm the right
partner for you?
?You know, so, I'm doing it ??
?I'm so surprised by this.
Leslie, you either have to take
my offer or it may go away.
Leslie, do you want to hear
other offers or not?
Narrator:
Two Sharks are out.
Leslie has one offer
on the table from Lori
for her magnetic picture hangers
GoodHangups.
But she may jeopardize the deal
by waiting to hear
from Kevin and Daymond.
Lori, I 100% agree you are
the right partner for me.
I do need to hear out
the room.
?Bird in the hand.
?You do.
?It is. It is. It is.
?Bird in the hand!
It is, but believe me, Lori,
I'll make this work.
?Leslie, I'm gonna give you ??
?Leslie! Leslie! Leslie!
I'll give you $100,000 for 15%.
?Whoa!
?$100,000 for 15%.
I want to take this to ShurTech,
the people who make Duck Tape.
I want to give you
some leverage.
I want you to squeeze her down.
I'm gonna do this favor for you.
I know the president of Staples
and the CEO.
?We all do.
?We all do.
?But wait.
?So what?
Also, I think
this would work.
Going back to Shutterfly,
who bought GrooveBook...
Perfect add?on,
don't you think?
I did $38,000 a minute with them
two weeks ago on QVC.
And every time he goes on,
the stock price goes down.
I also did cupcakes
at $38,000 a minute.
So please stop
talking about it.
I did $40,000 in ??
Kevin, is there
an offer coming?
Yeah, are you
doing an offer?
I want you to go with Lori
'cause I think you're great,
but I'll do $100,000 for 10% so
you can drive her price down.
Wow, you're giving her exactly
what she's asking for.
Yes. I'll do it.
But you want her
to go with Lori?
I'll do it for 10%, but I want
you to squeeze her head.
Cuban: [ Laughs ]
So, just to ??
Leslie, do you think that's
a nice partner to have ??
someone who wants to squeeze
a woman's head?
I don't want to see you
taken advantage of.
?Wow!
?Really, it's not.
Okay, Leslie,
you got three offers.
John:
Hold on one second.
I absolutely know
that Lori
is great for this deal,
of course, right?
I didn't think about
that point with Shutterfly.
And then me ?? I want to sell or
license or work with ShurTech,
the ones who do all
the Duck Tape in the world.
So I think those are
our unique selling propositions.
Lori, would you be interested
in teaming up
with either Daymond
or Mr. Wonderful?
Wow, Lori's not
enough for you?
I don't really need to team up
with either of them.
None of us need each other
on this one.
The important thing,
Leslie,
is that when my entrepreneurs
do a deal with me, they get me.
I'm the one that's on the phone
with them.
I'm the one that's doing
the designing of the packaging
and helping them to get
everything done.
Does she look like someone
who didn't do their homework,
who doesn't see us
all with our entrepreneurs?
She knows who does it.
I'm just telling you
I'm not gonna ever speak ??
I have great respect
for my fellow Sharks.
Leslie, do not give up 20%.
That's very foolish.
But I do not ever speak
for what they do,
as they shouldn't speak
for what I do.
?Right. Exactly.
?I can only tell you what I do.
Daymond will do it for 15%.
I'll do it for 10%.
And I'm a good partner.
?So start squeezing.
?Isn't that obnoxious?
?It is! It is!
?Not at all.
?But I love him.
?This is the Shark Tank, Leslie.
?Reject his offer.
?This happens in the Shark Tank.
Just because ??
All right, 20% is
a bit much equity for me.
?Way too much.
?What's your counter?
So my counter is would you be
open to $100,000 loan for 10%?
If I don't repay you
in the first year, you get 20%.
You got it.
?Done.
?Done.
Whoo!
[ Laughs ]
Leslie, you made me an offer
I couldn't refuse.
We will be
a dynamite team.
We will.
We really will.
We're gonna take this
to be huge.
I'm gonna ?? Anyway, bye.
Bye!
[ Laughter ]
Whoo!
Oh, my God!
I did it, did it, did it!
She's just
way too mellow.
Yeah, she doesn't have
any energy.
La, la, la, la, la!
Yes!
[ Grunting ]
If you're at home watching
and you have an idea,
trust your crazy idea,
and then hustle, hustle, hustle
to make it happen.
Narrator: In Season 7,
we watched Matt Alexander
and Mike Kannely
secure a deal with Kevin O'Leary
for their prototype
toilet?bowl light IllumiBowl.
Kannely: IllumiBowl
is a motion?activated,
toilet?bowl night?light.
I'll give you 100 grand for 25%.
?You got a deal, Kevin.
?Yeah.
Narrator: Let's see what they're
doing now.
Kannely: Okay, guys,
we've got two more hours
to get all of these out.
Let's go!
Before "Shark Tank," we only had
$100,000 in pre?orders.
We had to do everything
in my spare bedroom.
We didn't even have product
made yet.
Making a deal with Kevin
allowed us to fill
all our orders
and really push
our brand forward.
Not only did we get
our first retailer,
but we got into
Bed Bath &amp; Beyond nationwide.
It's only been
a few months,
and we're already at over
$7 million in sales.
IllumiBowl,
Mr. Wonderful is here!
?Yeah!
?Hey, Kevin!
O'Leary:
This company is exploding.
They've got into
Bed Bath &amp; Beyond,
and it's selling through
like hot cakes.
If we're gonna make this
the number?one way
to light up a toilet bowl
in America,
it has to be 10 times
bigger than this.
You got to ramp up
production.
You've got to blanket
the entire market.
It's really important now
that they get to the other big
boxes ?? Walmart, Walgreens.
They've got to get to every
single retailer,
and I want my team
to help them get there.
I love you guys.
?[ Both laugh ]
I think we're getting close.
[ Chuckles ]
Oh, man.
I've done a lot
of "Shark Tank" deals.
It's really rare when a couple
of entrepreneurs
like Mike and Matt
blow it up so big so fast.
Next stop ??
world domination toilets.
We're gonna flush away
the competition.
"Shark Tank" has really changed
our lives.
We're lighting up toilets,
but we're also creating jobs,
and we're inspiring people to do
more with their lives.
With the growth
of IllumiBowl,
our aim is to turn this into
a $50 million company.
This is
our American dream.
All: IllumiBowl!
[ Sighs ]
?Let's do it!
?Thanks, bud.
Producer:
Five seconds to the doors.
4, 3, 2, 1.
Narrator:
Next up is an entrepreneur
capitalizing
on a new trend in eating.
Hello, Sharks!
Whoo!
Whoo!
I'm so glad to be here.
