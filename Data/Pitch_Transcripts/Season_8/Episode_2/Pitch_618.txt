any suit jacket
into a tuxedo in seconds.
[ Laughter ]
No longer are you
gonna have to go out,
rent, or purchase
another tuxedo again.
Oh, my. [ Laughs ]
Choose from
an unlimited array
of fabrics, designs,
and patterns,
limited only
by your imagination.
Let me show you
how it works.
We simply adhere it
to the exterior of the lapel.
[ Laughs ]
Greiner: [ Chuckles ]
It's press?and?stick.
?Cuban: Oh, I want one.
?Fold over the excess.
?I want one.
?And in seconds,
you have a one?of?a?kind
conversation piece.
?[ Chuckles ]
?You sure do.
You would
so wear this, Mark.
In a heartbeat.
Now this is definitely
one?of?a?kind.
Our lapels have even evolved
into a branding tool,
marketing tool, as well
as a fashion accessory.
I know you don't wear
jackets often,
so I got you a nice,
little jacket for you
I want you to try on for me,
please.
Okay.
And again, this can be
a woman's accessory, as well.
We all know suit lapels
for women and men...
[ Laughter ]
...come in notched
and come in peaked.
Look up for me, please.
Thank you very much.
John: Hey, buddy,
watch that hand.
[ Laughter ]
And in seconds, look how
beautiful that is.
Lori, going out to the club
tonight?
[ Laughter ]
The clown look is more you.
?Good luck with that.
?Okay, cool.
?All right.
O'Leary:
All right, many questions.
First question is,
I take it out tonight.
I look spectacular.
I want to use it again.
Do I remove it,
put it on back to the paper,
and can I use it again,
or do I have to throw it out
and buy a new one?
No, you can definitely use it
again up to 5 to 10 times,
depending on how
you take care of it.
Does it ruin any different types
of fabrics or materials?
Absolutely not. I've personally
ruined several suits
finding the right application,
the right adhesive.
But I knew I was onto something,
so I just continued with it.
I'm Jeff.
And this is
my 17?year?old son, Jack.
And we're from Mandeville,
Louisiana.
Jack and I have been
fishing together
since he was one year old.
I could cast a fishing pole
before I could even walk,
but that certainly doesn't
mean that we're experts.
Oops.
[ Chuckles ]
We've had too many trips where
we came home empty?handed.
There had to be a way that
we could catch more fish.
So we invented it.
Jack has always been
an exceptionally bright kid.
And he is really the driving
force behind this business.
Instead of going out with
friends, I stay at home working.
I built the website, the
prototyping, the engineering.
Ohh!
We know that we need to get into
the big retail fishing stores.
?That was a huge gar fish.
?Ohh!
We can't get them
to take our calls.
?Wow!
?Whoo!
I put in $75,000 to get
this business started.
?Whoo!
?Whoo! Yeah!
This is real money.
This is real lives.
This is real people.
It has to succeed.
Bye?bye, big guy.
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Jack Danos.
And my name
is Jeff Danos.
We're a father?son team from
Mandeville, Louisiana.
We're seeking $150,000 in return
for 10% of our company.
We're the inventors
of the TactiBite Fish Call.
"What's a Fish Call,"
you ask?
Well, it's like a duck call,
but for fish.
You see, the two of us
have been on countless
fishing trips together,
and even though my dad claimed
to be an expert fisherman,
the truth is on plenty of trips,
we really didn't do so well.
Now, come on, Jack.
You know that I've always been
the fish master.
[ Chuckling ]
Whatever you say, Dad.
So, anyways, we came up
with a way to help my dad
and all of the other
"fish masters" out there
catch more fish.
The TactiBite Fish Call
works by sending out
sounds and vibrations that
attract predator and game fish.
You simply turn it on, toss it
out, and cast around it.
This is what
the fish hear.
[ High?pitched rattling ]
And they can't help
but head towards it
in search
of their next meal.
It's affordable, compact,
and, yes, it really works.
We already know that this thing
works on fish.
Now we want to see if it will
attract the Sharks.
So, tell us about your business.
How much have you sold?
?Can we see the product?
?Wait, can we see it?
So, essentially,
that sound that we heard...
?Yes.
?... that attracts the fish?
Yes.
It makes them think
other fish are feeding.
That's correct.
[ High?pitched rattling ]
And that is our
"scared shrimp" sound.
Scared shrimp?
[ Laughter ]
Both: Exactly.
Do shrimp
really make sound?
Yeah, so, it will.
[ Low?pitched rattling ]
Oh, it makes multiple
different sounds.
Depending on the fish
that you are going after.
"Sound number one ??
scared shrimp."
What is sound number two?
So, that's called
"rattle battle,"
and you can hit ??
That's it right there.
So, we found that freshwater
fish really like that sound.
So, how many more fish
do you find you catch
by throwing this
into the water
versus when you went out
on a normal fishing day?
We used to be the guys
who would go out,
and whenever we'd come back,
we'd talk to other people about
how many they caught.
And we'd always catch
less than other people.
So now,
when we go back in,
we almost always have caught
more fish than the other people.
Can I just get
a technical description
of exactly how I use it?
This is the anchor.
So, when you toss it out,
this sinks down...
Yeah.
... and this stays on the top,
so it holds it in place.
Have you sold any?
?Yes.
?Great question.
So, we're glad
you asked this question.
Yes?s?s.
We've been selling these
for five months,
and we've already sold $330,000
worth of it.
?Yes?s.
?What?
What do you sell it for?
It sells online
for $99.99.
?Really?
?Yes.
?And what's the cost landed?
?$16 landed.
?What?!
?Nice.
?Yeah.
?Yeah.
?Oh, my gosh.
?Yeah.
Jack, are you in school?
What's your background?
So, I'm 17.
I'm home?schooled.
?You're only 17?
?We get that all the time.
I thought you were 22.
?Jack has been ??
?I thought you were like 32.
Well, he's been exposed
to business all of his life.
Herjavec:
So, Jack, every Shark up here
is an expert at something.
There's one Shark up here that
is an absolute expert fisherman.
Who do you think that is?
I think it's Daymond.
We would bet
it's Daymond.
You are the fish master.
Will this work?
How would I know
if it would work?
Well, what do you think?
You're a fisherman.
?He never used it before.
?The noise ?? Would it work?
Have you ever used
a fishing lure
that has a rattler
that makes sound?
Yeah, I use poppers,
rattles, all of them.
?Exactly.
?Exactly.
All right, so,
let's say a popper.
It's going into the water.
This is not going to
give a motion
to make the fish
jerk and react.
So, it doesn't make, like,
a splashing in the water,
but it does
simulate that.
Fish have what's called lateral
lines that run down both sides,
and it's basically
like our ears.
They have little hairs
that feel sounds
and vibrations
in the water.
And so they feel
something.
They feel like it feels
like a school of fish
or, you know,
prey that's injured,
and they head towards it.
How much inventory
do you have?
?We just ??
?$500,000 worth.
Wow! Where'd you get
the money for that?
?Wow.
?Daddy.
That was actually all
paid for by ??
So, our first order
was 3,000 units.
So, yeah, 'cause your costs
are so low,
you were able to buy them
for $85,000.
We sold those,
and we bought the next 6,000
just on the money
we had in the bank.
So you paid
for all that inventory.
?Yes.
?We own it.
So, with that inventory,
why don't you back yourself?
You have the money.
The reason that we wanted to
bring a Shark onboard
is because we know
what you can do.
We know that you can get us
into retail stores,
and we know that you can
just make it explode.
O'Leary: Okay, a little nervous
about the $99.
I'm thinking more
$69, $79 for them.
But, you know,
10%'s not enough
to get me out of the water,
I think.
It's too light.
So I'm gonna say I'll do
$150,000 for 20%.
Before we go cutting
our valuation,
I'd just like to explain how we
got there with the valuation.
?Sure. Fire away.
?That's fair. Go ahead.
So, so far this year, we've done
$330,000 in five months.
So this year, we will do ??
If we just stay on track,
we'll do over $750,000.
On that, we'll net
at least $300,000.
And so what we did is we took
a 5x multiple on that,
and that got us
to $1.5 million.
That's a good call.
Jack, you are the freakiest,
smartest 17?year?old
in the world.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay, guys, let me tell you
something, Jack.
The way I look at it is,
99 bucks may not play,
and they may not put and give it
shelf space on that basis.
I don't know that yet.
We're all gonna learn that
together.
Other Sharks may give you
a better valuation,
but for me,
it feels right at 20%.
?Your valuation's fair.
?Okay.
John: I think your valuation
is fair, as well.
Reading
in between the lines is,
there's gonna be expected work
on our side,
besides capital,
and that's time.
So I'm gonna match
Kevin O'Leary's offer,
and I just want you to choose me
over him at the equal value
so we can screw him
together.
[ Chuckles ]
All right, guys, look,
I just want to show you
something very important.
Just as you think.
I don't often bring this out.
This is very important.
He's gonna make your money
disappear.
Mr. Wonderful
is open for business.
?[ Laughs ]
?Ooh!
?We love that.
?Exactly.
And that's very special.
Very special.
Okay, so, guys, since you have
all these hard?core fishermen,
and the only thing that I fish
for is money and deals,
this isn't something for me.
So I'm out.
?Okay. Thank you for your time.
?Thank you.
I know fishermen will do
anything to catch fish.
?We all want to catch fish.
?And it's a passion.
I don't think I've seen
any sport
as passionate
as fishermen.
I like this because
some of the most popular
infomercial products
were fishing products.
Really?
That's the world
that I'm really in.
?Okay.
?I love TV sales.
I love the infomercial world.
I have great partners.
I see this as being able
to blow it up
by doing a great infomercial
with it
so that people can see
how it works.
Yes.
Lori, are you in an interview,
or are you making an offer?
?I'm making an offer.
?Before we die.
Okay, I'll give you
$150,000 for 15%.
Thank you for your offer.
Better offer.
Can I just ??
Can I ask why you ??
Like, what ?? Do you feel like
our valuation is too high?
Like, what ??
I think everybody agreed that
we were at a fair valuation.
You know what you guys are
running into,
and it's very simple ??
When you actually get a Shark
as an investor,
that's extremely valuable.
We've learned that
over the years,
and I don't do that
for free.
That's why I have
this plaque.
?That plaque.
?It's expensive.
What I would like
to counter ??
Lori, would you do $200,000
for the 15%?
Narrator:
One Shark is out.
Jack and Jeffrey have
three offers on the table
for their fish baiter
TactiBite Fish Call.
And they've made a counteroffer
to Lori.
Would you do $200,000
for the 15%?
No.
I know with my Simply Fit Board
infomercial we just did, right,
I probably put personally
150 hours into it
from editing it, producing it,
the script, everything.
I don't think your brand
is fishing, Lori.
I got to tell you.
?It was really ??
My brand is product.
I don't care
if it's fishing or a tutu.
It doesn't matter to me.
You're that good
at everything, Lori?
O'Leary: I just don't
think your brand is fish.
How chauvinistic
are you?
?Very.
?Thank you, Daymond.
Here's my thing
about Lori.
I think she's great
at what she does, right?
?Has everybody made an offer?
?Not yet.
?We haven't ??
?Oh, Robert.
We're not sure
if we've ??
We'd like to hear
if you have an offer.
You've thrown some chum
into the water.
We have.
They're hearing ??
The Sharks are hearing the call,
I believe.
Absolutely.
You know, I find it
very interesting
that every Shark told you
your valuation is fair.
How often do we ask that
question on the show?
How rarely does somebody give us
a good answer for that?
I love the story.
I love your sales.
I like the offer you made.
?Okay.
I'll give you
the $150,000,
and I'll give it to you
for the 10%.
I'll give it to you
for the 10%.
?Ohh!
?I won't give it to you for 10%.
Because I don't like him
doing that.
Doing what?
I will ?? Because you're sitting
there lecturing them.
Doing what?
John: Guys, let me say, I'm not
gonna counter against Robert.
I'm gonna stay
where I'm at.
I want to ask you
a question.
How many times do you think
each one of these Sharks
go fishing a month?
?I would be lying if I guessed.
?Greiner: Admittedly, I do not.
I go fishing a month
about six times.
?Do you?
?He does.
?Yeah, he really does fish.
?So I live this.
See, while he's fishing,
I'm working at making
our guys money.
But that's a whole
different thing.
Yeah, when I'm fishing,
my money's making me money.
?[ Laughs ]
?I'm gonna tell you this.
So I'm letting you know
that's where I stand,
and I'm gonna allow them
to fight.
Mine is $150,000 for 10%.
But I'd like you to answer now.
So, I'm not gonna wait
for Robert.
Just one question ??
Would you be interested
in partnering with Robert
for the same $150,000 for 10%?
No, because
I don't need Robert.
I know I'm the one that's gonna
be doing all of the work.
She didn't offer you
the right amount of
money at the beginning.
He doesn't know how to do
an infomercial.
She's reacting,
as she always does,
to what's happening
in the water.
We all know how to do
infomercials.
Robert did this
the other day.
I'm not fighting
for Robert,
but we all know how
to do infomercials.
I'm not
gonna deal with it.
?It's ridiculous.
?I believe in you.
I think you're great.
I'd like you to take my offer.
And I respect if you don't.
When I'm buying
a tractor?supply company,
she's gonna be selling
earrings.
I respect Lori. You don't need
two Sharks on this.
Look, I gave you
what you wanted.
$150,000 for 10%.
Robert, we would love
to accept your offer.
?Bang.
?Let's go fishing!
?Let's go fishing!
?Whoo! Let's go! Come on!
?Let's go!
?I'll go fishing now!
Yeah!
Oh, my God.
Thank you.
?Thank you, guys.
?Good luck.
?Thank you.
?Whoo!
?Come on.
All right!
That was awesome.
That was awesome.
We did it.
To see those guys stand up there
and say that,
"Jack, you've got to be
the smartest 17?year?old kid
that I've ever met" ??
There's just nothing
like it.
Well, I guess
I'm taking this back.
[ Laughter ]
I'm gonna put it back
and bring it out later.
