My name is Brandon Zavala,
and I'm the founder
of Apollo Peak,
and I am seeking $100,000
for 10% equity in my company.
Sharks,
you know how it is.
It's been a long day at work.
You're super stressed out,
and all you
really want to do
is unwind
with a bottle of wine.
But you've got
nobody to drink with,
except for maybe your cat.
But cats don't drink wine,
right?
Well, wrong.
Zavala: So, Sharks,
who would like to partner up
to ensure that every cat and dog
has the opportunity
to enjoy a fine glass of wine
with their human companion?
Wow!
O'Leary: Brandon, is there
actually alcohol in it?
Zavala: No alcohol.
So, the cat wine, uh,
contains catnip, essentially,
which makes cats act like
they're a little drunk, um,
and they're made with
organic beets, too,
for the color.
Herjavec: Do you have wine
for us to taste?
I do, and let me bring
that out for you right now.
Now, Brandon,
are we trying the cat wine?
No.
If we drink catnip,
what happens?
You'll go to sleep,
probably.
It puts you to sleep?
It's actually used in,
like, sleepy ??
sleepy teas
or herbal teas.
Can you put some
in Lori's?
But it makes cats
really frisky, right?
It does, yeah,
and it's essentially the smell
that makes them frisky.
[ Laughing ]
Kevin, you could be the king
of QVC cat wines!
Zavala: [ Laughs ]
[ Laughs ]
Here's one for you.
to try.
Greiner: Thank you.
Moscat ?? Mos?cat?o.
You definitely have cute names
for these things.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you very much.
Here you go, Kevin,
Daymond.
Mark, here you go.
Well, cheers,
fellow Sharks!
Cheers!
Salud!
John: Cheers!
Herjavec: Cheers.
Salud!
And I'll cheers to you
as well.
Kevin, what kind of a wine
is this?
Industrial.
[ Laughter ]
So, Brandon, let's talk about
this business, okay?
Yeah.
Um...
Did you even drink any,
Kevin?
Absolutely not.
[ Laughs ]
That cat is not
drinking this right now.
What's going on?
It's got a hangover.
[ Laughing ]
He drank too much
last night.
No, essentially, what we
want with cats in general
is a comfortable situation.
So usually, when you're at home,
they'll come up,
and they'll actually start
sniffing the drink itself, too.
Um, and when they sniff it,
they'll start potentially
playing with it.
Some of them
will drink all of it,
some of them
will drink a little bit.
It's a gimmick, right?
You're doing this as a gimmick.
Zavala:
The initial Pinot Meow,
yes, it was gimmick.
But we've moved from that.
So, we've learned ??
got out and started making
our dog wines.
You have dog wines
as well?
Yes,
we do have dog wines.
John: [ Laughs ]
It's the ?? the wine you have
in front of you, actually.
Greiner:
What was that one called?
That's the Char?dog?nay.
[ Laughing ]
See, here's the thing.
Char?dog?nay...
Your names
are really funny.
Herjavec: It's cute!
Zavala: Ridiculous, right?
I mean, they're really funny,
they're really cute,
but I don't see this
as anything anybody would buy.
Cuban:
Well, let's find out.
How many sales?
So, we've sold
just over $192,000.
Over what period?
I ??
Zavala:
The past three months.
Three months?
John: Whoa.
Zavala: Yes.
Greiner: Really?
Yes. That is correct.
Really?
I ?? in a million years,
I never would've thought.
Never would've thought that,
yeah.
I would not have thought that,
either.
So, how did you come up
with the idea?
I was working
in the pet industry, um,
working with
a pet food company.
I was a sales rep
for them.
Okay.
And so, I saw a niche, uh,
for beverage, essentially,
for animals.
What does
one single bottle cost?
This bottle ??
the eight?ounce bottle
that you see here
is $11.95.
Whoa!
Wow!
What does
it cost you to make?
The cost for
this bottle here ?? $1.25.
O'Leary: I'm a wine guy.
In America,
97% is sold for under $12.99.
So,
we're asking cat owners
to pay the same price
as humans
for a bottle of wine...
Greiner: More.
...except, it's only 40%
of what they pay
$12.99 for, right?
Mm?hmm.
I mean, are you worried
about that price?
Zavala: Um...
Cuban: Yeah, because,
you know what?
I've heard
a lot of people talk
that when they're looking
to buy wine for their cat,
they ??
they price?shop first.
[ Laughter ]
So, $100,000 for 10% ??
you're saying the company's
worth a million dollars.
So, you believe you're on scale
to do what?
I believe 2017 will be
between $1.2 to $1.5 million
in sales.
Wow.
Cuban: I believe
every word you've said,
but there's just no way
on God's green earth
I'm gonna be in
the cat wine business, right?
[ Both laugh ]
Of all the things
I could spend my time on,
no disrespect,
but I'm just not
built for this business.
so for those reasons,
I'm out.
Mark, you don't appreciate
the finer things in life
for yourself
or for a cat.
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
Listen,
I think it's really cute.
It's something memorable.
The names are great.
It's not a business for me,
so I'm out.
But, you know, cheers.
You are the pet rock
of the pet food business,
my friend.
Power to you,
but I don't see it
as a staying business.
I like to build
a long?term business,
so I'm out.
O'Leary:
You know, many years ago,
I actually was
a marketing manager
for Miss Mew Cat Food,
and I learned something
about the cat business.
Cats are very finicky,
as you know.
They are so difficult
to actually
get into a routine.
They are.
And once they cling on
to a flavor or a brand,
they don't change.
If you ship the product
to five families with cats,
and three of them,
or two of them,
make it
part of the cat's diet,
they'll start
buying cases.
I've been there
in that business.
That's a ??
that is a gold mine.
So, here's my offer.
Cuban: Whoa!
It's a huge advantage.
Cuban: Brandon, two offers.
Two offers.
John:
You have the offer now.
Yeah,
what are you gonna do?
Zavala: I'm thinking.
Hmm.
Well, I'll tell you what.
Daymond,
I love your offer,
but one thing
that I really do enjoy
is the margins that we get
for selling online.
You're toast, Daymond.
I'm signed on HSN.
We sell online.
You ready to go?
Yeah.
Would you be willing to counter
anything better, Daymond?
You have to drop
your equity now.
Drop your equity?
Or ?? or ? no.
If that's gonna
be the decision,
because of equity ??
that's ??
so you're gonna make the mistake
over something like that?
No, I can't do it.
So, Mr. Wonderful,
I think we have a deal.
Cat wine.
Bad deal!
[ Both laugh ]
I can't believe it!
I love it. I love it.
Thank you, thank you,
I appreciate it.
That's what I love
about "Shark Tank."
Who could even think this?
Yeah.
I love it!
Zavala:
Honestly, I can't believe
that I got multiple offers.
I was not thinking
that any offers
would really
come out of this.
I'm really excited
to get a deal ??
absolutely excited.
I think it's gonna help us grow,
and we're gonna become
nationally and globally
recognized now.
I don't want the cat ??
just the wine, just the wine.
The cat is now yours.
Greiner: See, he won't
even touch the cat.
Why ?? why isn't this guy
actually drinking any wine?
What's the matter
with you?
Greiner:
He didn't like it.
Oh, he's ??
look at the hair on him!
[ Laughter ]
Okay, buddy.
That's why
I gave you the cat.
You [Bleep]
That guy made...
[ Laughing ]
I got a black suit on.
John: We are, like ??
He did a deal with a guy
who hates cats.
Yeah, he's dealing
with a guy ??
O'Leary: I love cats.
I love selling cats.
