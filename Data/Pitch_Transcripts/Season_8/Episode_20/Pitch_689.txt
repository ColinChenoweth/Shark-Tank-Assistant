They all came
from humble beginnings,
and are all self?made.
The sharks know what it takes
to build business empires
from nothing into billions.
Now, they are investing
in entrepreneurs' dreams.
I don't like
to sit behind a desk,
and I love money.
Who wants to help grow
the future of food?
I was sitting here in awe.
It looks ridiculous,
but it works!
It still feels a little bit
like a class project.
Narrator: This is the art
of doing business.
I'll go 20%.
I'm gonna make
the exact same offer.
This is "Shark Tank."
I could outsell Lori any day
on QVC.
Greiner:
I have a ?? I have a...
He just wants to win.
Yes, I do!
I believe
in your product.
I'll do it for 12.5%.
Oh, my God.
My name is Cam Mackugler,
I'm a Vermontrepreneur
from Middlebury, Vermont,
here seeking $500,000
for 10% equity
in my start?up, Seedsheet.
Seedsheet can make anyone
into a gardening guru.
People want to eat
delicious food
and feel confident
that they're feeding themselves
and their family
healthy, natural,
and ethically?sourced
ingredients.
So, my company
hacked horticulture
and combined algorithms
with agriculture
to create a product
that turns anyone
into a successful farmer ??
no overalls required.
[ Laughs ]
The Seedsheet features
a weed?blocking fabric
that's embedded with
an arrangement
of dissolvable pouches,
each containing
a buffer of soil
and organic,
non?GMO seeds.
Simply unroll the Seedsheet
on top of prepared soil,
add water...
Mackugler: Sure.
Cameron,
what's your background?
My background
was in architecture
and environmental
studies.
Okay.
And so, the origin
for the Seedsheet
actually came one summer
when I was house?sitting
for a co?worker.
And because it was Vermont,
this "house" was actually
a fully?functioning
80?acre dairy farm...
Wow...
and I was paid with
access to their garden,
looking at this garden
that was magnificent, perfect,
and every plant
was the correct spacing apart.
And so, I wondered,
how can you approach agriculture
from an architect's
perspective?
And, so,
how much does it cost?
So our smallest?sized
kits ??
these are these
container?sized kits, right?
so that's retailing
for $14.99,
wholesale for $7.50,
and that's costing us
between $1 to $3 to make.
And how ??
what are your sales?
So, our sales to date
are 156 grand,
and that is...
That's this year,
or just from the beginning?
Total.
So, we are 20 months old.
We've only been in business
for one gardening season.
So, you're really trying
to simplify the process
for somebody.
I can obviously
just buy the packs of seeds,
which I'm gonna guess
are a lot cheaper.
If you were to buy
eight different
varieties of seeds,
that'd be eight seed packets.
Each seed packet
for a high?quality, organic,
non?GMO seed like ours
is $3 to $4.
So already,
you're saving money.
We are specifically
targeting new gardeners,
and so that fastest?growing
gardening demographic
is Millennials.
How do you reach them?
Going through retail
is going to be tough,
don't you think?
Sure.
So we've started ??
um, this past spring
was the first spring
that we've been in business.
And we launched
in 46 Home Depot stores.
Right, but retail ??
you've got to deal
with inventory,
inventory planning,
you know,
and then marketing
and mark?downs and returns
and all that stuff,
right?
Yeah.
Online,
you could build to order.
Yeah.
John: All right,
so here's what I think.
I was sitting here in awe,
I mean, that this is
a disruption,
this is just incredible,
so...
Disruption?
Yeah.
I think it's a disruption
in the space.
I think that ??
or, it's just creating
a new space of home gardening,
making it easy.
But I think
I have to agree with
what some of the other Sharks
have said.
You're saying that you're
targeting Millennials,
but yet, the first step
is in retail.
And you haven't
figured that part out.
I think you have a lot
of challenges at this moment
that's gonna cost
a lot more money,
so I'm out.
Thank you very much.
You know, I ??
I struggle with the idea.
You know,
I'm looking at my son.
Is he gonna order
a kit like this?
Absolutely, 'cause you know,
Millennials love it ??
back?to?the?farm
kind of thing.
Mm?hmm.
But is he, then,
gonna go to a garden store
and get some dirt
and actually put it down?
Um, no.
I just ??
I don't know if I see it.
I'm out.
Thank you very much,
Robert.
I freakin' love this.
All right!
I love it
for a lot of reasons.
I'm an urban girl,
so I never
got to grow things ??
didn't grow up
around any of that.
But when I first
found out about all of it,
I wanted to be
a hydroponic farmer one day.
[ Laughter ]
Literally, no joke.
Mackugler: [ Laughs ]
That's awesome.
And QVC is
highly?demonstrable products.
And they have a huge
gardening time of year,
so I think
that I could help you
to get publicity out there,
get people to know
what it is,
get some good sales fast.
But, you only have
160 some?odd thousand
in sales, right?
Right.
So, I'm gonna offer you
$500,000 for 22%.
Thank you very much
for that offer.
I'll do it for 15%.
Ugh, you know what?
He always just does that.
I'm just ??
Cuban:
Lori, Lori, Lori,
If I love something,
he comes in ??
To keep him at the 22%,
I'll split it with you.
Well, I see it, Mark...
John: Shark fight.
...as if it were you and I
together...
Yeah,
that's what I'm saying.
...then, I think we should
get a higher percentage,
because we can blow this up
even bigger.
John: [ Laughing ]
I do. I do.
You got to be ??
No, I get that, I get that,
but it's...
I do, because I know the work
that I'm gonna do,
so for 11% for me...
You need to get ??
...I mean,
I ?? I got to hustle.
I got to really ??
I got to really be selling
a lot of things on TV
for you.
What do you think?
With two of you
coming into that,
I would entertain
a higher valuation,
but when we start comparing it
against Kevin's here,
that does [ Laughing ]...
O'Leary:
I could put you on QVC
or anywhere else
you want to.
... make it a little
more difficult for me.
No, you cannot.
You have the queen of QVC.
You have grand, whole,
high?exalted ruler of QVC.
He's been selling
a lot of booze.
Cuban: Kevin, I think
we know your offer.
O'Leary: But my offer ??
He can sell wine,
but that's it.
My offer ??
Let's compare the offers.
He never even said,
"Thank you."
I let you in,
I could take you out.
[ Laughing ]
O'Leary:
But the point is...
You never said,
"Thank you."
I'm a really good salesman.
That's the bottom line.
John: Shark fight,
shark fight, shark fight!
"I let you in,
I could take you out."
O'Leary:
So, the bottom line is
you could the deal
with two Sharks for 22%...
Herjavec:
Well, hang on a sec.
But you never said
whether or not
you would come in on that.
At 22%, that'd be
the lowest I could go.
That'd be the lowest
you could go.
Yeah. I like it,
but I think it's not
a slam?dunk by a long shot.
And, so,
that's why I think with Lori,
we get the sales
quickly with QVC.
I'll get you on QVC.
That's not a problem.
If I can get a firm offer
right now
from Lori and Mark for 20%,
I will be happy with that.
Well, I will give you
a firm offer right now
for 20% from Lori.
That's fine.
Would you be in on that?
I said from me.
I'm gonna make it
more interesting for you.
I'll do it for 12.5%.
Oh, my God.
Oh.
Cameron is seeking $500,000
for 10% of his planting
innovation company, Seedsheet.
He has an offer from Lori ??
$500,000 for 20% ??
that was immediately undercut
by Kevin's offer
of $500,000 for 12.5%.
You know what, Cam?
He's just
throwing out these offers
just to, like, beat me.
He doesn't really
want your deal.
O'Leary: No.
It's the "Shark Tank"!
[ Laughs ]
He doesn't!
He just wants to win.
Yes, I do!
I believe
in your product.
Is your offer
$500,000 for 20%
with Mark
or without Mark?
Greiner:
I looked at Cam and I said,
I would do
the $500,000 at 20%.
Herjavec: So, Mark,
are you in on that offer?
At 10%,
it's not enough,
because I know the hustle
I'm gonna have to do for you.
Mark, are you in
on the 20%?
Cuban: Congrats, Cam.
Thank you all. Appreciate it.
Good job, Cam.
Mackugler:
I am so very honored
to have multiple offers.
In the end,
Lori has a lot of experience
with home and garden products,
so it was a great fit ??
destined to be
a good partnership.
Narrator: In season seven,
Jeff Klimkowsi, Sean Riley,
and Ryan Meegan
struck a deal with Mark Cuban
for Dude Wipes ??
disposable wipes for men.
300K, 25%.
Yeah!
?Whoa!
?Let's go.
Narrator: Let's see
what they're up to now.
Klimkowski:
For a brand like ours,
pioneering a new category,
it's important
to get the word out.
Man: Pick up a Dude Wipe
and take it...
...To the hole.
We put out a funny video,
and Mark
jumped at the opportunity
to make a cameo.
Now, that's fresh.
Meegan: Our viral video
has received
over a million views,
and that's translated
into a lot of business for us.
Riley:
The year before "Shark Tank,"
our sales were $250,000.
Since "Shark Tank,"
we've grossed
$3.2 million.
Today,
we have meeting with Walgreens.
If all goes well,
this could be our biggest
retail deal to date.
As a health, well?being,
and beauty retailer,
your product definitely
hits that sweet spot
for our customers.
We've decided
to push your product
and do 4,200 orders.
We had a good feeling
about this meeting,
but it blew
our expectations away.
This deal alone's gonna
double our retail presence.
Now, we're gonna be in
over 7,200 locations
nationwide.
So this is where we test
new merchandising concepts,
and I want to show you
how your product's
gonna come to life.
?Perfect.
?Looks good.
Riley: "Shark Tank" experience
has been great for us.
It's allowed us
to build our brand
to dudes
all across the country,
and it really does show
that if you follow your idea,
you can grow it
into a big success.
and it's because of him
that I became a teacher.
There are a lot of different
entities that you can use
to get your product
to market.
I've been teaching university
entrepreneurship classes
for the past seven years.
I realize it's one thing
to teach entrepreneurship,
and quite another
to be an entrepreneur.
It was on a flight to Asia
where I had a simple problem
I'm sure thousands of people
have also experienced.
That's when
I came up with an idea
to innovate a product
that hasn't changed
in over 4,000 years.
I'm gonna miss you so much.
Let's stay in touch.
[ Applause ]
If you came out here
and said to me,
"Look, we're gonna
price these things
at the lowest point
to get distribution,
and everybody
that buys chopsticks
will have
only one alternative ??
buy the old ones
at 6 cents,
or by my new innovation
at 6 cents.
Mine's better.
It gives you an extra bonus
of having this on the top."
That's a strategy
that makes sense.
You seem to be going
in a different direction,
which I don't think
is gonna work.
I...
I think ??
you remind me of Bambi
in the bamboo jungle...
Greiner: Oh!
...and you're about
to get squashed.
I'm out.
