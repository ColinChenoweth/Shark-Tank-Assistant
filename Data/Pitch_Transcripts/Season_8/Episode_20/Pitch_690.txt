My name is Mylen Yamamoto,
and I'm from Honolulu, Hawaii.
I'm a fourth?generation
Japanese?American,
and my grandpa
fought in WWII.
And my dad has worked for
Hawaii's Department of Education
for over 40 years,
Yamamoto: It's scary to leave
a steady income,
a place that I've known
for seven years,
and going out
and risking everything.
But, it's important to prove
to myself and my students
that I can make this business
a success.
This is my big moment.
I've been teaching
entrepreneurship for so long,
that now it's time
to walk the walk
and put my lessons
to practice.
I am Mylen Yamamoto,
the inventor of CropSticks
from Honolulu, Hawaii,
and today I'm seeking $75,000
in exchange for
12.5% of our company.
Yamamoto:
That was awesome!
3 <i>Hashi</i> is a Japanese word
for chopsticks.
Oh!
Chopsticks
are traditionally paired
Repeat!
Yamamoto: Very good.
But in modern?day commerce,
it's very expensive
for restaurants
to maintain this rest,
leaving chopsticks to lay alone
on dirty, germy tables.
Chopsticks have been around
for over 4,000 years,
and that's because
this ancient utensil
is simply amazing.
But they're not
without faults.
For example,
these chopsticks
are circular in shape,
and when placed on the table,
they tend to roll off.
And these chopsticks
are made of wood,
killing millions of trees
every single year
for a product
we simply throw away.
Ha!
[ Laughter ]
When you split them apart,
you can get splinters!
[ Growls ]
But, CropSticks
solves all these problems.
CropSticks is the first?ever
disposable chopstick
with a built?in rest.
Simply snap it
apart horizontally.
Greiner: [ Laughing ]
Yamamoto:
The top becomes a rest.
Cuban: Oh.
Try to do that with
traditional chopsticks,
it's impossible.
What a good idea.
[ Growling ]
Ha!
Herjavec:
[ Growling ]
Ha!
[ Growling ]
Yamamoto:
No more splinters,
and CropSticks is better
for the environment.
It's eco?friendly
because we make our CropSticks
out of bamboo.
Simply put, CropSticks
are chopsticks re?invented.
This is my
sushi?chef husband, Ron.
He's gonna pass out
some sushies for you.
Herjavec: Thank you, Ron.
Ron: Here, Robert.
Yamamoto:
I'll be right back ??
gonna change into
something more modern.
Lori's is
a California roll.
Thank you.
Mr. Wonderful.
O'Leary: Thank you.
Thank you.
Daymond,
we have an eel?avocado for you.
John: Thank you.
O'Leary:
Mmm. That's good.
Herjavec: Oh, wow.
Ron: And, Mark,
here's spicy tuna for you.
Awesome!
That's what's up!
Hello. [ Laughing ]
Oh, Mylen,
what happened to you?
So, it broke off easily ??
has a little
scoop?out section here.
Mm?hmm.
And you can just
lay it down.
It's very clever.
Thank you.
Greiner:
So, what are your sales,
and how long have you
been in business?
No, no,
don't get there yet.
[ Laughing ]
To the sales,
we had a kickstarter in March,
so we sold 21,800
off of that.
Good!
And right now,
we have conditional
purchase orders for 190,000,
and of that in profit
is $125,000.
Yeah!
Wow!
So, our profit margin
is about 65%.
Wow, good for you.
Thank you, Mark.
Who's your
purchase order from?
So, we have one from
a very large hotel chain.
It's a Hyatt.
And we also have one
from a large
Asian distribution company.
And, do you have
a patent on this?
We have
a provisional patent.
Herjavec: Mylen,
what's your background?
I was a teacher.
I got my Masters
in Communication.
My first teaching job
was as an English teacher
in Japan.
And after that,
Loyola Marymount found me
and hired me
into their department
to teach entrepreneurship.
Oh, that's cool.
Teach entrepreneurship?
Oh, you were teaching
entrepreneurship?
Yamamoto: I was.
and I just stepped down
from the position
to do entrepreneurship.
To be an entrepreneur.
Let's get back to
the business for a moment,
because I was actually
involved in a deal
that made bamboo knives
and forks.
What I found out is,
the restaurant will not pay
1/8 of 1 cent more
for a bamboo spoon.
They couldn't couldn't give
a flying "beep"!
So, if you're
a restaurant chain,
generally you buy these
from a distributor.
You care about every cent
in what you pay.
What do yours cost
versus those?
Two ?? um, we sell it
for 10 cents.
We sell it to distributors
for 6 cents.
We make it for 2.2 cents.
Good for you.
Herjavec: And what does
a restaurant today
pay for them?
It depends.
So, middle?tier,
like your P. F. Chang's,
pays about
3 cents to 8 cents.
Then your high?tier market,
like your Nobu,
pays anywhere from 8 cents
to as much as 17 cents.
You will not be able to charge
a cent more for this.
Nobody will care.
But if they can buy it
for the same price ??
That's our ??
Okay, so, that's our go?to
market strategy, Mr. Wonderful.
Middle?tier,
high?tier market ??
sell to them first,
scale up,
bring our costs down,
then go to
those Panda Express.
Greiner: Do you have
a distribution company
that is saying,
"I'm gonna take you
all these places"?
Not yet.
Not yet. Why not?
Do you know?
We are still
relationship?developing,
especially the one
that bought into us already.
We want to make sure we get
the logistics right on that.
Mylen, I don't think
anybody really cares
about branding
in chopsticks.
I don't think anybody says,
"Make sure my chopsticks
are CropSticks."
It's done
at the distributor level.
Cuban: Mylen, first,
congratulations.
You know, you've actually
gone from academia
to, you know,
implementation.
Thank you.
But it still feels a little bit
like a class project.
I think ?? I think you're
being overly?optimistic.
I think there's
a little bit of realism
that's not there.
I'm out.
John: I like the product.
Um, I think it really is
a B?to?B play ??
as you're doing ??
just selling directly to
the Hyatts and restaurants.
Um, it's a little
too early for me,
so I'm out.
Thank you, Daymond.
To your points about
being the Bambi
in the bamboo forest...
Greiner: Aw.
John: [ Chuckles ]
...I?I've had less than $20
in my bank account.
I know what it's like
to be strategic
and make something
out of nothing happen.
All right,
I don't think you're a Bambi.
I can feel that from you.
I admire the fact
that you left
a safe environment in school,
and you actually did it ??
you started a business.
Thank you, Robert.
Um...
the bad news is,
Kevin's right.
If you can't sell it
for the same price,
it's a commodity.
You're gonna have
a very challenging time
adding value
to a commodity.
I'm out.
Thank you, Robert.
O'Leary:
Then, there was one.
Lori.
I do not see you
as a Bambi at all.
I see you as
a strong, smart woman.
Um...
I think you did
a better mousetrap.
I mean, it was clever.
Thank you.
But...
I don't see it
as a business for me.
But I hope
that it blows up for you.
I'm out.
John: Good luck.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Appreciate your time
and the feedback.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Good luck.
Good luck.
?Okay, good luck.
?Sayonara.
Herjavec: Those shoes look
really hard to walk in.
They really are.
I'm gonna take them off.
[ Laughter ]
Excuse me!
Bye, thank you.
Greiner: Bye.
