My name is Rick Pescovitz
from Cincinnati, Ohio.
I'm the inventor and owner
of Under the Weather,
and I'm seeking $600,000
for a 10% interest
in my business.
Wow.
Under the Weather
has revolutionized
the outdoor spectator
experience.
Have you ever
frozen your butt off,
been poured on in the rain,
or even pelted by hail
while watching an outdoor event?
I have and it sucks,
let me tell you.
[ Laughs ]
Mother Nature
can be a bear.
I'd like you to meet
Jordan and Stacey.
Their kids, like mine,
chose to play outdoor sports.
We had Fall soccer...
[ Thunder rumbles ]
[ Laughter ]
...and ?? and you never know
in the Fall.
You got wind,
you have the wind.
[ Wind whistling ]
Oh! Awful!
Aw!
Pescovitz:
How miserable can it be?
[ Laughter ]
Cuban:
Out with the wind!
Then we're not done,
'cause then we have
winter football.
Oh, my.
Oh, it's starting to snow!
[ Laughter ]
Oh my gosh,
it's snowing!
It's Arctic, it's cold.
[ Laughter ]
You think you're safe
in the summertime,
but you're not because
we bake in the heat
with those rays of the sun.
It's boiling out.
[ Laughter ]
It's frustrating, okay?
After 15 years of this stuff,
I had enough.
And that's when I invented
the Under the Weather
Sports Pod.
[ Laughs ]
I will show you
how easy it is to pop open.
Each pod weighs
less than seven pounds ??
completely portable.
Greiner: Oh, my God!
[ Laughter ]
Water ??
Water? and wind?proof.
It's also treated
with a coating
that prevents the harmful rays
of the sun getting you.
It's got transparent sides
on three sides.
[ Laughs ]
You will not miss
your little guy's goal,
if he has one,
no matter where he is
on the field.
And last of all,
we have
the connecting versions
which are the MyPods.
Is there a wall
between it?
There is.
There's windows that go up,
doors that go up and close.
[ Laughter ]
My wife yells a lot
at the games.
Zip 'em out.
I zip it up.
Let's take a look.
[ Laughter ]
Cuban:
That's hysterical.
It looks ridiculous,
but it works!
35 degrees warmer in there
than the outside.
It is ??
'cause of body heat?
Yes, from your own body heat ??
warms it up.
So, Sharks, which of you
would like to get in a bubble
and help our sales double?
I would love to see
if a couple of Sharks
would like to
come give it a try.
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
Pescovitz:
Wow, we got ?? come on,
we'll all take turns.
We'll take turns.
John: Wow!
Lori, I know you're
from the Windy City.
I know. I know.
I got to see this.
I want to see
if they tip over.
Lori...
Greiner: Okay.
Pescovitz:
They better not tip over.
Let's get you in there.
[ Laughs ]
Lori,
get your shoes in there.
Yeah, you got to put
your shoes in there.
Oh, my God.
I feel like we're Pod People.
Okay there you go.
We got the Fall ??
what's going on?
It's like a confessional!
It's raining!
You better zip that up, man!
[ Laughter ]
[ Rain falling ]
Oh, my God!
[ Laughter ]
You think that's good,
right?
Somebody tip 'em!
[ Laughs ]
So, your kids are out there
actually playing in this crap,
and you're like...
Yeah!
Yeah, but they're
getting to run around.
They're getting exercise.
They look like
they're in jail!
Was it comfortable,
Daymond?
Yeah, I mean, it was.
It's a little bit hard
to see through the plastic.
Herjavec: Right.
Yeah, no, it's great.
Inside is great, I...
Was there a bathroom
in there?
Greiner: It works.
[ Laughs ]
O'Leary: So, tell us
where you're selling them,
how you're selling them,
and give us your forecast
for how much
you're gonna sell.
85% have been
online sales.
Really?
How much does one cost?
Retail is $99.99 apiece.
Okay.
Okay?
That's reasonable.
Uh, my cost landed,
is about $23.
John: Okay.
About a 75% margin.
Rick, why don't we get down
to the sales.
O'Leary:
What do you got?
Well, we did about
$2 million the last year.
Wow.
Nice!
We netted about
a million dollars.
He made
a million dollars
Made a million dollars.
Congratulations.
Herjavec:
Yeah, congratulations.
Thank you, Mark.
Thank you.
You're a millionaire!
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
Millionaire ?? well,
I don't know about all that.
I got to put it back in.
Do you have a patent
on it?
I do.
And we have a
utility patent pending
on the adjoining ones
and this shape.
Then, we have
nine design patents.
What's your background?
Okay, so,
I started a company
that did embroidered apparel
and promotional items.
At the height of
the business,
we were doing
about $8 million.
I hated what I did.
I hated that business,
and I sold it in 2012
for, uh, $3.5 million.
My brother was a partner,
and, uh...
[ Voice breaking ]
And my brother ??
they had three great kids,
great marriage.
And...
[ Cries ]
[ Crying ] The week
before Christmas 2010,
we left Detroit,
and it was snowing.
And he skidded,
and got broadsided by a semi.
Oh, no.
Herjavec: That's awful.
Ugh.
So sorry, Rick.
Oh, we're so sorry.
The day before that ??
[ Sniffles ]
I still have the e?mail ??
'cause I'm known in my family
to come up
with crazy?ass ideas.
I believe it.
And I had this e?mail,
and I said, "Mark," ??
that's my brother's name ??
"What do you think, man?
I got this.
I like this idea."
This idea?
He said, "This time,
you're on to something."
Oh, wow.
He was gone, but...
Greiner: But he's ??
I believe
he knows what you've done.
[ Exhales sharply ]
That's a tough story,
Rick.
Greiner:
Yeah, we're so sorry.
[ Sniffling ]
We're so sorry.
He'd be so proud of you,
though, I think.
So proud.
It's, uh...
Herjavec:
But, you know what?
You proved him right,
right?
Thank you.
Yeah.
What made you want to become
an entrepreneur?
[ Normal voice ] I ?? I like to
wear what I want every day.
I don't like
to sit behind a desk,
and I love money.
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
I love money.
John:
Sounds like all of us.
Ta?da!
What's your
inventory?management system?
Uh, my head.
Ooh.
Let ?? let me understand
your numbers here, right?
Okay, so, how many units
did you sell last year?
I ?? I think
we sold 22,000.
Okay, so those numbers
add up to...
Wow!
22,000 units?
Yeah.
That's amazing.
That's impressive!
All right, so you're asking
for $600,000 for 10%.
It doesn't look like
you need the money.
What's the purpose
you're here?
I'm a salesman
and a product guy.
I want expertise
on worldwide distribution.
There's 70 million
soccer parents just in the USA.
My wife,
who's been in marketing forever,
thinks we should be in retail.
But here's the thing ??
the knock?offs are out there.
So, you want a partner
for all those aspects
because you're the only one
making the decision on,
"Yes, should I take up that
real estate
so they don't take
somebody else?"
Absolutely.
"Should I reduce this price?
Should I continue growing
more SKU?"
That's what it is?
Absolutely.
All right, well,
I'll get it started.
I'm, uh...
I??
All right, here we go!
Yeah, I would love to do
the deal,
but I think you keep online
to yourself,
and I think you license retail
to somebody else.
Let them deal
with all the headaches
so, you keep all the margin
and keep cranking those goods.
Let them deal
with all the warehousing,
on?boarding,
and all that stuff.
So ??
Who would
you license it to?
Uh, it's a person called
None of Your Business.
Um...
[ Laughter ]
Great company,
None of Your Business.
Shut Your Pie Hole.
Um...
?[ Laughs ]
?So, I'll give you
$600,000 for 20%.
Appreciate the offer, Daymond.
Good offer!
I'm going to make
the exact same offer ??
600K for 20%.
That was on my mind before
he started all that noise.
I think you need
a little inventory system
and accounting.
Rick,
let me tell you where I'm at.
I actually don't think
you need help.
I think you're killing it.
You have the same problem
I had when I was your size ??
is you want to do everything
'cause you can.
But you got to let some
of this knock?off stuff go,
and you just got to be
more efficient,
and you're gonna get there.
I don't think you need
the investment.
I'm out.
Thank you, Robert.
I appreciate it.
And I appreciate the kind words.
Well Rick,
you've got two offers.
So, you can wait for Lori
and Mark,
or you can take
a bird in the hand.
Rick has two offers on the table
for his portable
outdoor pod business,
Under the Weather.
Well Rick,
you've got two offers.
So, you can wait
for Lori and Mark,
or you can take
a bird in the hand.
Rick:
Well, I tell you, I came here
to make a partnership.
Mark, are you interested?
Yeah,
I'm definitely interested.
Um, are you doing any type
of SEO or advertising at all?
We just started.
We're doing 500 bucks a month
in the last four months.
We'd done nothing before that.
So, everything is completely
word?of?mouth.
We've spent 11 grand
on advertising in two years.
Outstanding!
That is incredible.
Wow!
John: Rick, I gave you
an offer in Spring, right?
It's now...
What are you doing, Mark?
...around Fall right now,
all right?
I'm listening.
I'm listening!
So, here's what I'll offer.
I'm gonna offer you $600,000
for 15%, right?
But I also want an option
to buy another $600,000
for another 10%.
It's gonna take a lot of work
and effort on my part that ??
You have time for me?
I always have time for you,
right,
but I also have a big staff
that ?? that will take over
your accounting if need be,
work on your inventory,
work on your software, right,
to do all the blocking
and tackling.
But if I'm growing it, right,
I want to be able to take
advantage of that, as well.
On both of these,
I'll let you put the money
right in your pocket.
Okay, when is the option period?
How long ??
12 months.
Thanks, Rick.
Appreciate it.
We're gonna make
a lot of money.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mark.
Wow.
That was an experience
right there.
My brother Mark meant
a whole lot to me,
and now I'm partnering
with a guy named Mark,
and maybe that's fate.
I'm happy.
I'm very happy.
