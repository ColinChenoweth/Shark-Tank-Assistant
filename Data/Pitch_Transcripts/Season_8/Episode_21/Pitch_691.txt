We believe that ??
Cuban: So, it's Bluetooth

Where ?? Give us the economics.
So, the products went live

a competing system
where you're walking around ??
Barbara wears this all the time
in her house ??
It's a blue box.
Parisi: Thank you.
O'Leary: That's an offer.

Thank you so much.

Thank you.
Parisi: Now that we've stuck
a deal with Barbara,
we are going to take

until there's confirmation
that this is
truly unique, right,
But you're not getting a nickel
till you show me you can sell.
Mark, you got a deal.
Done.
Wow.
Awesome, Mark.
Good going, guys.
Greiner: Congratulations.
I'm so excited.
Thank you.
