Hi, Sharks.
My name is Nick Nevarez.
And I'm Joe Parisi.
Our company, Guard Llama, is
based out of Chicago, Illinois.
Whoo!
We are seeking $100,000
in exchange for 5%
of our company.
Guard Llama is
a state?of?the?art
personal security platform
that provides discreet
and reliable security
in your everyday life.
Sharks, consider
the guard llama ??
docile, unassuming,
non?threatening...
[ Laughs ]
...at least
at first glance.
But when a predator approaches,
this all changes.
Llamas are known
for charging predators head on
with deadly force.
And now, Sharks, you, too, can
own a Guard Llama of your own.
I am not talking about
this magnificent animal...
[ Laughs ]
... but rather,
this wireless
Bluetooth remote.
Corcoran: Ooh.
Ooh!
What a disappointment.
We believe that it's
unrealistic to think
that in an emergency
you have time to dial 911,
have a conversation, which takes
over two minutes on average.
Parisi: Guard Llama believes
that your safety cannot wait,
so we've taken the liberty of
updating the process ourselves.
And here's how it works.
Visit our website
and purchase one Guard Llama
for every person you love,
including yourself.
Your remotes will arrive
in the mail
with instructions to set up
a physical profile.
This information is given
to the police
during your time of need
so they can identify you.
In the event
of an emergency,
simply double tap the button
on your GPS remote
to automatically activate
the Guard Llama system.
No more digging around
in your purse or pockets
searching for
a cellphone.
Your GPS location
and physical profile
are immediately sent
to a 24?hour emergency
dispatch center,
and the police
now know exactly who are,
what you look like,
and where you're located
in under 30 seconds.
Sharks, invest in us
and help us guard millions
of lives with the Guard Llama.
Parisi:
I don't know if the margins
are as good on live llamas.
Are they good guard animals,
seriously?
Parisi: They're ph??
They're phenomenal.
So, ranchers actually ??
But why? They charge? They ??
Yeah, they charge 'em head on.
They make noise?
Yeah, they make
noise as well.
Is it Bluetooth
to your phone?
Correct.
Do you have
to have your phone present
to actually activate it?
Yes. It works within
150 feet of your phone.
We believe that ??
Cuban: So, it's Bluetooth
to your phone,
which indicates an app.
Correct. So, we have
an emergency dispatch center
in Springfield, Illinois,
that's staffed.
Cuban: Okay, so it goes to
an emergency dispatch center.
Parisi: Correct.
Cuban: How many customers
do you have?
How are you selling?
Where ?? Give us the economics.
So, the products went live
last September.
Uh, we have 2,000 users.
We sell the product for $10
a month or $100 for the year.
And how are you acquiring
the users?
So, we have two different
customer acquisition strategies.
One is classic
online digital,
and then the other is
actually in?person sales,
which have worked out
really well for us.
We have a partnership
with the National Association
of Realtors...
Mm?hmm.
... and so, they know
that Realtors are at high risk
to be in trouble,
because there's
a lot of people...
When they're at a home,
and they're doing ??
...going into vacant buildings
with people they don't know.
Mm?hmm.
And so, they partnered with us
to provide that solution.
Greiner: So, let's say
that you have this with you.
All you have to do
is just press the button.
Correct. Twice.
Press it twice.
Then you will immediately
receive a phone call,
so it works just like
a home?security system.
If you don't answer it,
it dispatches the police.
Oh, I see.
If you answer it,
you have an opportunity
to enter a disarm PIN.
If somebody's
robbing you ??
Let's go through this scenario.
Yep.
I press the button,
the phone rings,
the potential thief is...
Says "Answer your phone."
Yep.
... and they say, "Yeah, hi.
Is this,
uh, Dolly Llama?"
Right. So they say,
"Please enter
your disarm PIN."
So now the thief goes...
Okay.
..."Oh, you activated a system.
Disarm it."
So, you go, "Okay."
You can enter any PIN except
for your actual disarm PIN,
and it will say, "Thank you
for entering your disarm PIN.
Have a great day."
It hangs up. The thief thinks
that it's been disarmed.
The police come anyways.
The police come anyway,
and now we can communicate
to the police that they
actually entered a distress PIN.
I get it.
So, not only did they indicate
they need help,
but they've gone out of their
way to confirm an incorrect PIN.
What about colleges?
I mean, I'm trying to think of
where is it...
Colleges are great.
... easy for you
to do the sales?
Parents would pay, right?
Parisi: Yeah.
O'Leary: There's
a competing system
where you're walking around ??
Barbara wears this all the time
in her house ??
It's a blue box.
"I've fallen down,
and I can't get up!"
Right.
And they have
the inherent problem of brand.
No college student is carrying
a Life Alert around.
What I can tell you guys
is that it sells.
Cuban: I get that
this is an easy sell.
I like everything about your
company except for the product.
Parisi: Thank you.
O'Leary: That's an offer.
Yeah. That's fantastic.
Thank you so much.
All right.
I appreciate it.
Is that an acceptance?
Oh, I'm ??
Here's the thing ?? I understand
how compelling the problem is
that you're going after.
That said, this has
so many warts for me.
The direct?sales model is
a nightmare and hard to scale.
I realize it's been successful
to you up to date,
but for
the first 2,000 users,
you might be able
to pull that off.
I think your brand is soft,
too,
and I think you've built nothing
proprietary other than a button,
so I'm out.
Parisi: Well, there was
a woman last week
who was
in the trunk of a car,
and they killed her
before they could find her.
She was on the phone
with the sheriff
telling them,
"I'm in the trunk of a car."
They could not find her.
She's dead.
But how does your product
solve the problem?
Okay?
Parisi: I agree.
And, of course,
I know that space,
because I'm the sweetheart
of all the Realtors,
and so if I was fronting for
you, you would sell like crazy.
You have to pay 20% equity ??
that's a lot.
That's a lot.
But, you know, I??
I'm gonna stick
with my offer.
You can choose.
All right. Um...
Barbara,
will you do 15%?
Um, no, but I'll do
18%.
[ Wails ]
[ Laughs ]
All right. Let's do it.
Done? Got it.
Cuban: Congrats, Barbara.
Greiner: Congrats.
All righty, baby.
Parisi: I am a good salesman
after all.
Nevarez: Thank you.
[ Laughs ]
Have a good one, guys.
Thank you.
Parisi: Now that we've stuck
a deal with Barbara,
we are going to take
the real?estate market
and move on to helping provide
safety and security
to the rest of America.
It's unbelievable.
I mean, we were in there,
and I got to be telling you ??
when he starting pooping,
I was like,
"What the heck is going on?!"
[ Laughs ]
Narrator: In season five,
Al "Bubba" Baker
made a deal with Daymond John
for his patented
boneless baby back ribs.
I think I'm gonna
take Daymond's deal.
Ah!
Narrator: Let's see
what they're up to now.
you don't get a nickel from me
until there's confirmation
that this is
truly unique, right,
that you are the only player
and it does what you say,
you hit your sales projections
for the next 6 and 12 months,
and the third is,
you hire an internal PR person
to go out there and start
telling people the story.
And I usually hate
hiring PR people,
but I don't think
you're the guys to do it
yourselves, personally.
Okay?
I'm gonna offer you
500K for 15%, all right?
But you're not getting a nickel
till you show me you can sell.
Mark, you got a deal.
Done.
Wow.
Awesome, Mark.
Good going, guys.
Greiner: Congratulations.
I'm so excited.
Thank you.
No butterflies for you.
[ Chuckles ]
Good job.
Man.
Riley: You know, with Mark on
board, we won't have to choose
