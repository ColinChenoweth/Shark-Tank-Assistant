Can we get samples?
Are you passing out anything?
Nevarez: Yes.
Of course.
Sacca: I got to be honest ??
I'm a little let down.
I was thinking
this was gonna be, like,
sending llamas
to all these farms,
Because we can get ?? the same
way an Uber can find you ??
Because of the locator.
That makes sense.
We use the GPS chip.
My younger brother
was on a motorcycle
Can we see some samples?
Definitely.
O'Leary: Thank you.
You're welcome.
There are some
very large companies...
Yes.
...that take people's
photographs,
why wouldn't they simply offer
the same deal
to their millions
of customers?
We've thought about that,
obviously.
I'm glad!
[ Laughs ]
So, what's the answer
to that question?
Well, there are
a couple of things
that a lot of people don't
realize about photo printing.
To make double?sided prints
actually requires
a different
technological stack
than companies like Shutterfly
have in place.
Now, they could do it if
they invested a lot of money.
every Shark's got the same
question ?? does it work?
I was thinking
the same thing.
