Can we get samples?
Are you passing out anything?
Nevarez: Yes.
Of course.
Sacca: I got to be honest ??
I'm a little let down.
I was thinking
this was gonna be, like,
sending llamas
to all these farms,
and you were gonna let
us finance that,
and I was super intrigued.
[ Laughs ]
Because we can get ?? the same
way an Uber can find you ??
Because of the locator.
That makes sense.
We use the GPS chip.
My younger brother
was on a motorcycle
a year and a half ago,
a truck hit him,
and we couldn't find him
for two days.
Wow.
He was in a coma.
Luckily, he survived, uh,
but I personally was shocked
that we couldn't have
a local cop
simply tap into his GPS,
but the privacy federal laws
forbade that.
Yeah.
And so I think there's
a real need for your product.
I'd like to make you
an offer.
I'll give you $100,000 loan
at no?interest rate for 20%,
and I want $2 per sale
until I recoup money,
and then it goes away.
Because your sweet spot on this
is it's a panic button.
If you approach the Realtors,
I'm convinced that's the easiest
low?hanging fruit you'd grab.
Hi, I'm Sam.
And I'm Savannah.
We're here to talk to you about
Flag and are seeking $375,000
in return for a 5% stake
in our company.
The number of photos taken
each year has tripled since 2010
and is projected to grow
to 1.3 trillion by 2017.
And as you probably know,
75% of photographs taken today
are taken on phones.
Because my phone is always
on me and my kids are so cute
and my life is so interesting,
I take photos every day.
But even the best ones may never
make it off my phone, laptop,
and I could break them
or lose them.
That's why
we created Flag,
the world's first truly free
photo?printing app.
No printing charge.
No shipping charge.
No subscription.
No credit card required.
So, how do we do it?
We're using the blank space
on the back of photographs
that's been wasted
for over 100 years
to deliver targeted ads.
The idea is simple ?? you get
beautiful, free photo prints,
advertisers get to connect
themselves with your memories
and deliver ads
that will be kept for decades.
So, Sharks, we urge you
to capture the opportunity
and help us
to develop Flag...
And print money...
Both: ...together.
[ Laughs ]
Can we see some samples?
Definitely.
O'Leary: Thank you.
You're welcome.
There are some
very large companies...
Yes.
...that take people's
photographs,
print them,
and ship them to you.
Yes.
We sold Grovebook to ??
What? ?? Shutterfly.
If this model were to work,
why wouldn't they simply offer
the same deal
to their millions
of customers?
We've thought about that,
obviously.
I'm glad!
[ Laughs ]
So, what's the answer
to that question?
Well, there are
a couple of things
that a lot of people don't
realize about photo printing.
To make double?sided prints
actually requires
a different
technological stack
than companies like Shutterfly
have in place.
Now, they could do it if
they invested a lot of money.
The reason that we can do all of
these fancy shapes and finishes,
and we can do completely
variable orders,
is 'cause we're
laser?cutting our prints.
They don't do that.
Here's a little version
of the app.
This is how you
choose custom frames.
This is something people
haven't been able to do before.
I choose the picture
of my daughter,
I tap on the frame
that I want to use.
It's really simple.
How are you
getting people to pay
for the advertising
on the back?
And how many do you have?
We have sold $150,000
in advertising in 3 months.
To various clients.
So, what kind of companies
have you actually sold to?
Who are they?
So ??
Yeah, go
with the number?one.
It's Visa.
And Visa loves
what we're doing.
I've never heard of them.
[ Laughter ]
O'Leary: Visa is one
of your customers?
Yes, they realize that
we have the ability
to brand really well, because
we're turning ads into gifts.
How much money have
you guys raised to date?
We've raised
$1.6 million.
Ohh!
Greiner: Wow!
At what valuation?
At what valuation?
Well, we didn't raise it
all in one chunk.
The last money
that we closed ??
a year ago, we did at
a $5 million valuation.
Corcoran:
Did you mention how many photos
you've sent out to date
with an advertisement
on the back?
Sure, so ??
So we've been in market
three months, and each month
we've sent out 80,000
to 100,000 prints per month.
Wow.
We're outsourcing
all of our production right now.
When we insource, our cost
per pack will come down.
We'd we looking
at 20?cent ad costs.
Greiner:
What does it cost per card,
and what is the ad revenue
you get per card?
We're selling ads
for a buck an ad.
Really?
Yeah.
That better be really targeted
advertising for your customer.
Well, it is,
and it's print.
It's ?? These aren't clicks.
These are things that live
in people's houses.
Something that people
will never throw away.
You've got to compare
these things to catalogs.
[ Chuckles ] In the back of
a frame through, right?
We ship 20 prints free
each month.
People aren't gonna frame
20 photos a month.
Sure.
And our prints
are such high quality,
it's the kind of thing
you pass on to friends,
put up in your cubicle at work,
display on your coffee table.
Are your ads
working for them?
Our ads haven't started
running for them yet.
We've sold them.
We've done the deal.
We've been paid.
Sacca: But is the
laser?printing technology
or the double?printing
technology exclusive to you?
No.
Cuban: So, if I ?? I ??
If we wanted to go out
and buy one of each
of those printers,
we could do it ourselves?
Yes, theoretically
you could.
O'Leary: There's nothing
proprietary about this.
And, you know,
you're nice people,
but I'm worried a big foot
is gonna come down
and just squash you
like the cockroaches you are.
The reason why we're here
is we absolutely need
to insource production.
Right now we're spending
a lot of money
by printing in one facility,
cutting at another,
laminating at another.
Cuban: But something
doesn't make sense.
You've raised $1.6 million.
Yes.
You're asking for ??
$375,000.
$375,000.
Right, $375,000 is gonna get you
what you need
to bring it in house.
Why don't you use the $375,000
out of the $1.6 million?
Actually, we are raising
right now $3 million.
Oh, and you didn't think
you should tell us that?
I'm ?? Sorry.
I'm ?? I apologize.
Corcoran:
You raised $1.6 million.
Yes.
You're looking at us
to raise additional money.
I don't like the way
those numbers sound
and going through a heck
of a lot of cash, so I'm out.
Okay.
Okay. Thank you.
Can I ?? Can I say one thing
about our ad?sales model?
And besides which ?? for some
reason, I don't trust you.
O'Leary: Ohh!
I'm ?? That's a ??
I'm ?? I'm really sor??
That's natural for Barbara.
It could be
that English accent.
[ Laughing ]
I'm sorry to ??
O'Leary:
What I want to know ??
and everybody else
is in the same boat here ??
every Shark's got the same
question ?? does it work?
And we don't know.
Can I ??
The thing is is that we've been
in market three months,
and big brands
are compelled by the idea
that this is something
that people are...
They want to test it.
We don't know
if Visa's coming back.
We have to find out if
the advertisers get a return.
Yeah.
And you should be motivated...
[ Spanish accent ]
Itchy, wowwa, caramba ??
[normal voice] you want
to solve this problem.
Cuban:
That's why they're here.
Cowley: Absolutely.
We have ?? We have ??
But the answer isn't just to
take more dough from investors.
You should be saying to them,
"Look, Visa's coming back.
It worked, and now
we need money."
I feel like
I have to come over
and spank you with a ruler...
Greiner: I know.
...for not staying focused on
the thing that matters,
because you are on the cusp
of the abyss, the darkness...
W??
... the evil of going to
friggin' zero with a bullet.
So, what are you gonna do,
Kevin?
Well, I'm out.
Can I ?? Can I ??
Okay.
I want to share with you
a story.
Several years ago, we had a new
product that was launching.
We decided,
smartest thing to do ??
we will give them away
for free,
and they'll come back
and buy it again.
I'll just post it
on my social.
So, we launched it at midnight,
and, I'm not joking you,
by 12:30, 5,000 were gone.
Before we know it,
it's 3:00 a. m.,
and it's something
like 35,000 are gone.
That taught me
a hard?and?fast lesson.
When you give away
anything for free,
there are going
to be millions of takers.
But then on the flip side,
the problem is
is you need advertisers
to help you to pay
for all this free product.
For those reasons,
I'm out.
Cuban: You've got
so many moving pieces.
You've got to raise
a lot of money
so that you can insource
so your costs are reasonable.
Then you've got
to find enough users,
which is
gonna cost you money.
If you're able
to solve those problems,
then you're just
in the advertising business
and having to prove
that your ads work better
than everybody else.
You add all those up,
and I see that as an
insurmountable set of problems,
so for those reasons,
I'm out.
I ?? I ?? Well,
I want to make sure
there's one thing
that's clear ??
This is definitely
a freemium model.
We don't anticipate
that all of our revenue
is gonna coming from
advertising.
Sacca: Wait. You guys,
we're in the 11th hour,
and you're just now gonna pivot
and tell us you're freemium?
It's not ?? It's not ??
It's not a pivot,
and I'm ??
I really ?? I ??
Somebody call a doctor, 'cause
this pitch needs CPR right now.
I mean, you've got
to be kidding me.
You're bringing it up now?
You're one competitor
having a laser printer away
from not being able to charge
anything for that. Come on.
Well ??
When you guys walked in,
I thought I smelled like a
little bit of smoke in the air,
then I realize
it's from the bonfire of cash
you guys are burning back
at your headquarters.
I don't usually invest
in businesses
that are doing
old?school ads
with a really weak
business model
in crowded markets
with five?alarm cash burn.
Can I ??
And this time
is no different.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Sorry, guys. Good luck.
Corcoran: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Greiner: Good luck, guys.
I was thinking
the same thing.
And ?? And you would go there
and license it to them
and not have
all of the headache
of marketing
a new bike company.
The way
that we entered the market
is actually
by being a component supplier
and, essentially,
licensing the technology.
So we're actually
in the market right now.
SureStop,
our brake technology,
is on 40,000 bikes out
in the market.
Now you're talking!
Oh, really?
Now that's
a lot more interesting.
That's more interesting.
Yes, yes, so...
By the way,
can I try it?
Yeah, that's ??
Absolutely.
Give him the one that
won't stop.
[ Laughs ]
I do want to look at how
it's integrated.
Yeah.
Y?You guys can come up
and look at this close up, too.
The easiest way is
to look at it right up here.
So, lookit ??
These are the most common
types of brakes
in the world.
Sacca: Yeah.
This pad drops in,
when it hits the rim,
the force of the wheel
just slides it.
It all mechanically
pulls on ??
Sacca: So, the only thing
that's actually different
about this
is from here forward,
just on the regular caliper.
That part, right there,
is genius, actually.
Yep.
Or even ??
So, hold on.
Let's watch this character.
[ Laughter ]
Corcoran: Character.
Greiner: So, like antilock
brakes in your car,
it's antilock braking system
for you bike.
Exactly.
Does it do, like,
the du?du?du?
No, they d??
You know?
You don't feel that?
No, this is
much more smooth.
It just brakes it?
And it took us a while
to develop a rubber compound
that would give you
enough braking power...
I'd watch out.
... but not enough
where it feels jumpy.
Yeah, let's get him out
of the way, there.
O'Leary: You know what?
I'm having a childhood moment.
I'll see you guys later.
[ Laughter ]
Good, he's gone.
I'll do a deal just
for that reason.
Sacca: It's a genius solution.
I've seen this problem.
This solves it immediately.
It's great.
Well ??
So, why haven't all
the bike companies adopted it
unless it's a huge
cost increment?
Yeah, well, we ??
we offer it right now
for about a $4 cost increase
to a bike.
Corcoran: That's all?
That's fantastic.
The big problem
that we're seeing is,
some of the major manufacturers
tell us,
"If I put this
on some of my bikes,
it makes all my other bikes
look dangerous."
And so we're getting a lot
of resistance. We've been ??
That's dumb.
It's dumb.
They should put it
on every bike.
We totally agree.
So, but ??
Tell us your sales
and break it out for us.
Yeah, yeah.
With SureStop,
we sell the pad for about $5,
so we've got out 40,000 bikes.
That's about $200,000
in sales,
and it's taken us
about three years to do that.
