Hi, Sharks.
I'm Ian.
Guardian has created the world's
safest children's bikes.
The secret sauce
to Guardian Bikes
is our patented
SureStop technology.
Similar to antilock brakes
in cars,
SureStop solves the problem
of incorrect braking.
On a traditional bike,
if a child brakes too hard
or pulls the wrong brake lever
at the wrong time,
the front wheel can
stop too soon,
causing the bike
to flip over.
Mm?hmm.
Not with Guardian Bikes.
SureStop uses just
one lever
to help us bring Guardian Bikes
to every family in America?
Sacca:
So, let me ask you guys,
which one of you guys
has scars to prove
that you had wipeouts like that
as a kid, 'cause I g??
[ Laughs ]
Literally, I have
this huge gash in my chin
from that exact wipeout.
So we're launching
the Guardian Bikes.
We've launched those
about seven months ago.
We look at Guardian
as giving us revenue.
It's scaling revenue
a lot faster
than the licensing model
was,
but it's a Trojan horse, because
we're educating the market
on why this is safer
with our own bikes.
We're the only ones ??
But that's expensive, expensive,
expensive, expensive,
Tell us what
a Guardian Bike costs
versus any other bike.
Could I forbid you
from making Guardian Bikes?
I could keep you focused
on what has to get done.
In the meantime, you're wasting
your time listening
to Cuban's crap
about building bikes
when he knows there's not
a chance in hell
you'll make money
doing that long term.
They already are.
They're making nothing!
2,000 bikes is nothing.
Let's say if I gave you
500K for 20%,
but you're forbidden
from building bikes.
Yes or no?
Guardian Bikes.
But it comes
with a big contingency.
Let's say if I gave you
500K for 20%,
but you're forbidden
from building bikes.
Yes or no?
Corcoran:
Gosh. [ Laughs ]
You could tell him
to take a walk.
I don't want you spending
any of your time
competing in the
bicycle manufacturing business.
All of your time
should be spent
focusing on getting
the OEM license.
You need adult supervision.
You can't keep doing this.
You can't spend your time
building bikes
Guardian is
the road to hell.
The other one is you simply wait
out the manufacturers,
get as much PR around ??
Yeah, it's ??
Exactly.
Elon Musk will tell you
he's building the car
for his battery business,
right,
