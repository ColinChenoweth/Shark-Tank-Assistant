Hi, Sharks.
I'm Ian.
I'm Alex.
And I'm Tov.
We are the founders of Validated
from Portland, Oregon.
We are here today seeking
a $250,000 investment
in exchange for 8%
in our company.
Whether it's $16 parking or a
sudden surge in your ride share,
getting around is expensive, and
these costs can keep you away
from the shops and restaurants
that you love.
What if I told you your favorite
shops, bars, and restaurants
would cover your ride?
Introducing Validated, the app
that lets you earn free parking
and free rides
when you shop and dine.
Think of it like free shipping
for yourself.
We'll discover the businesses
around you
that will help cover
your transportation costs
in exchange for being
their customer.
Just tap a business to see
what's required to qualify
and how much
they'll validate.
Once you've spent
the required amount,
simply slide and scan
to unlock validation credits.
Stack credits from multiple
shops and restaurants,
and then redeem them
to your preferred mode
of transportation.
It's a win?win proposition that
makes getting around less a drag
and boosts businesses'
bottom line.
So, Sharks, which of you
is ready to get Validated?
It's interesting
because it gets people
back into
brick?and?mortar easier.
Yeah, and th?? and
that's exactly what we're ??
what we're seeing, Lori,
is that businesses
are doing anything
that they can
to get foot traffic
back in the stores per customer.
W?W?Wait. Bar??
Let me ask you
a simple question,
because I ??
I really don't get it.
Arnerson: Yeah?
When I shop and I get
a dress for $200,
they will give me,
basically, free parking?
They will give you
credits based on that spend.
But would it be enough
for me to park my car
and shop for three hours?
Totally depends
on the merchant.
So, we let the merchants
set their own offers
and their own spending
thresholds.
But even that vagueness, I would
think, from the consumer view,
uh, would be confusing
and not that motivational.
The exciting thing about it is
that you can stack up as you go.
So, let's say you're gonna go
out on ?? on the town,
you're gonna buy
a pair of shoes,
you're gonna go have lunch,
you're gonna hit a movie.
You can validate as you go, and
as you stack those credits up
you can easily pay
for your whole trip.
Sacca:
Give us some numbers.
Give us some sense of success
or failure so far.
So, right now we have
50 merchants
in our launch cities
of Seattle and Portland.
Right now, we're averaging
about 25 validations
per merchant
across those 50.
And so, the numbers are low.
We're early.
How early? How long has
this been in business?
So, we started
this last July.
We kind of pivoted
from something else
into this business.
Uh, by last fall, we had
a minimum viable product,
and we've been rolling
this thing out.
Tech question for you guys ??
what were you scanning?
We were scanning a QR code
that's essentially
a benign token
that is currently ??
Right, but where is that?
What ?? It looked somebody
was holding something?
Yeah, exactly.
So, essentially
you would walk up to the
merchant at the cash out
and would ask,
"Can I get validated?"
The merchant has it behind
the counter and shows it.
Okay, so the merchant
has their code...
Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
... and you just scan it.
So, what would you estimate
the value of a point to be?
So, what we ??
Sacca: No, to be clear ??
So it's one?to?one
per dollars.
Wait. Wait.
Okay, can we just get rid of ??
You're not parking your car.
It's equal to a dollar?
This is ?? This is to get you
a ride to and from, right?
So it's really like one credit
is one dollar.
One credit, one dollar?
Uh, you can ?? you can push
validation credits for parking.
So, we're gonna be partnering
with PayByPhone,
which has 12 million users.
They're a parking?payment
processing app.
It doesn't need
to be that complicated.
Look, Uber works 'cause
it's push a button, get a ride.
Your whole model should be "Buy
some stuff, get a ride," period.
Like, not "Park your car,"
and not, like,
"Hey, you can buy
some of the stuff here,
and some of the stuff there,
and split your car
parked on this level and
that level and buy more time."
The minute you say, "Use your
transportation mode of choice,"
and I start seeing you integrate
public?transportation systems
and all that stuff,
you've just made your comp??
your product
so unnecessarily complex.
Yeah, but they've got
bigger problems, right,
because you have to be the bank
for the points.
We are the bank, yes.
And you have to convince people
that the currency is valuable,
so you're also
the Federal Reserve.
That's a nightmare.
Right?
Chris suggests Uber,
but that's a limited option.
[ Laughs ] Yeah.
Not everybody uses Uber.
No one's ever called 85%
of the market
a "limited option."
Well, no, no, but it's still
not ?? not everybody's
gonna use it.
You just drove to the mall.
Chances are you didn't drive
to the mall in an Uber.
Well, the chances
are extremely high
you just went to the mall
in an Uber, actually.
Right, that's why parking lots
are empty.
Yes, Uber, Lyft ?? they are kind
of the zeitgeist right now.
Everybody wants to use it.
But in
the transportation pie,
if you look at it,
it's actually below 5%.
Be honest ?? when you start
slicing it to the people
who have an iPhone,
who download apps,
who are in the target market
for your advertisers,
it's a huge, huge piece
of the pie.
Definitely, definitely.
No doubt. Yes.
So we're not including,
you know, Florida retirees
who go to the 4:00...
That's not the issue.
It doesn't even matter, right?
It doesn't matter.
... early?bird dinner.
The point is
you're the bank.
Let's be honest here.
You're a consumer bank
and you're the Federal Reserve,
which complicates things
to an extreme.
You have so many
integration points
with all the different
participants.
It's burdensome, and there's
gonna be ongoing bugs forever.
That makes it more expensive.
The ?? The ??
So, for those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay.
You know, this sounds
so complicated.
Maybe I'm missing
the point here.
It's ?? It's n??
I'm not even sure
there's a need for it.
I'm definitely out.
Okay. So, let me just address
Barbara's point.
So, the reason that
there's a need for it
is because retailers are seeing
everyone move to online, right?
And so when you buy a product
in e?commerce,
what happens is 33%
of the time that product
is shipped back, and there's
this endless volley, right?
And so, what the
brick?and?mortar retailer
want to do is they want
to get people in the store.
I hate this.
This is going
to zero for sure.
You said you pivoted
into <i>this</i> nightmare.
Pivot the...
the beep out of it.
This is a dog.
I'm out.
Thank you.
You know,
I see some merit.
I could see restaurants
really loving it.
I'm not sure, though,
how many people
are gonna be using the app,
and for that reason,
I'm out.
Thank you, Lori.
Thank you.
I initially saw the tag line
in the first couple of screens,
and I'm like,
"That is smart".
Mm?hmm.
"These guys are
driving traffic
on a deal?discovery basis."
And then with each additional
slide, you lost me.
It's complicated.
There's choices.
The user experience sucks.
"We're gonna try and accommodate
your car and your parking
in this level
and that level,"
and then you show me
the QR code.
QR codes are the herpes
of mobile technology.
It should be as simple as
"Buy some stuff, get a ride,"
period.
Look, I don't believe
you're gonna make it.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Good luck, guys.
Please,
light the QR codes on fire.
Yeah, you don't want
to be a bank.
You want to be
a connection.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Tov: The way that we understand
our business,
the way that we understand
our customers
is far beyond, uh,
what they understand...
Mm?hmm.
...and I think it's been so long
that they worried
about paying
for transportation,
they don't understand,
like, what a pain point it is
for the rest of us.
And our business is
Guardian Bikes.
I first came up
with the idea
seven years ago
when I was in college.
My grandfather got in a really
serious bike accident
and broke several vertebrae
in his neck.
He fully recovered
after a couple years,
but it was a traumatic
experience for me and my family.
That work?
Nice.
There's a lot of
other technologies out there
where when you get
in an accident,
it helps to not make them
so severe,
but what's great
about our technology is
it prevents accidents from ever
happening in the first place.
Just like seat belts
and windshield wipers
become safety standards
in the car industry,
we want to make our technology
the safety standard in bikes.
Not bad.
Here we go.
Our families have invested
over $100,000 in our business.
Even my grandpa invested
in our business,
so there's a lot of pressure
to succeed.
What happened
to my grandfather,
I don't want to see happen
to anybody else,
and that's why we're trying
to bring this technology
to as many people
as we can.
We know we can make
millions of dollars
and also prevent
hundreds of thousands of people
from going to the emergency room
each year.
[ Tires scraping ]
and our company is
Guardian Bikes.
We're seeking
a $500,000 investment
in exchange for 10% equity
in our company.
Sharks, riding a bike is
an essential joy of childhood.
It's almost
a rite of passage
when you can finally take off
on your own.
However, those
early experiences don't come
without the risks
of an occasional spill.
Parents are always
looking for ways
to keep their kids safer.
We're here to help.
Guardian has created the world's
safest children's bikes.
The secret sauce
to Guardian Bikes
is our patented
SureStop technology.
Similar to antilock brakes
in cars,
SureStop solves the problem
of incorrect braking.
On a traditional bike,
if a child brakes too hard
or pulls the wrong brake lever
at the wrong time,
the front wheel can
stop too soon,
causing the bike
to flip over.
Mm?hmm.
Not with Guardian Bikes.
SureStop uses just
one lever
and always actives
the rear brake first,
and then intelligently
adds in the front brake,
eliminating the chance of ever
going over the handlebars.
With both front and rear brakes
always engaging,
kids can stop faster
and with more control.
But we didn't want
to stop at just safety.
None of this matters
unless kids love their bike.
So we designed our bikes
to appeal to kids
with striking designs that
make them not only the safest,
but the coolest kids bikes
on the block.
So, Sharks,
are you ready
to help us bring Guardian Bikes
to every family in America?
Sacca:
So, let me ask you guys,
which one of you guys
has scars to prove
that you had wipeouts like that
as a kid, 'cause I g??
[ Laughs ]
Literally, I have
this huge gash in my chin
from that exact wipeout.
We both have the scars,
and the whole inspiration for ??
for the company is
my grandfather
had that exact accident,
and he was really unfortunate
and landed on his head and broke
several vertebrae in his neck.
Oh, wow.
And it was a ??
It was a terrifying thing for ??
for me and my whole family
to have a family member
go through that.
My question right
out of the gate for you guys
is why in the world
would you go forward
and build a bike company
when you've got a technology
that every bike company
would want?
So we're launching
the Guardian Bikes.
We've launched those
about seven months ago.
We look at Guardian
as giving us revenue.
It's scaling revenue
a lot faster
than the licensing model
was,
but it's a Trojan horse, because
we're educating the market
on why this is safer
with our own bikes.
We're the only ones ??
But that's expensive, expensive,
expensive, expensive,
both from a marketing
and a capital investment
for your inventory.
Well, actually, it's returning
us a lot of revenue,
and that way,
we can make a lot more money,
you know, per sale
than the licensing side,
which is oftentimes
waiting like
a year?and?a?half
sales cycles.
We need to get to the point
where we're doing, you know,
millions of bikes,
and we can get there.
We've got, uh, Pacific Cycle,
which is, you know,
the single biggest manufacturer
of bikes by volume
in the United States.
They have finally gone forward,
and they're pitching
a SureStop?equipped model
into Walmart.
Yeah, that doesn't make sense,
like, to me.
Yeah.
If it's $4 to put this
on your bike,
and you keep your kids safer,
why would you not take this
and put it
on every single bike you have?
They've tried.
You know what?
It ?? It just ??
It does not make sense to me.
And you have a patent.
Yes, and, Lori, the reason ??
And you could go
to one of the majors, and ??
The reason why we got
into making our own bikes
was one of them told me,
he said,
"Well, if I put this on
some bikes and I don't
put them on others,
I might get sued that I didn't
have it on another bike."
Getting the distribution
into the major points of sale
is extremely challenging.
It requires a tremendous amount
of capital.
We've gone from zero
to selling in 65 bike shops
in about 7 months.
We're adding ??
It's nothing.
I?I know,
but we're adding ??
It's nothing.
But it's getting the company
to a point
where we're making money.
Corcoran: You want to know
what you're missing?
You're missing a salesman.
Well...
If a great salesman
had had that opportunity
to FaceTime
with the bike manufacturers,
I got to believe you'd be
in a different position.
I'm sorry, but I'm out.
All right,
thanks, Barbara.
Thanks.
Tell us what
a Guardian Bike costs
versus any other bike.
The 24?inch bike get
its landed cost of $146,
and we sell it wholesale
for $240.
The smaller size here ??
we landed for $132,
and we sell it for $228.
That's a more expensive bike
than I could buy
for a kid at Walmart.
Yeah.
But we've started with
the most premium bike first,
and that's
what these ones are.
We can introduce bikes
at different price points
whenever we want.
We want to be known
as making
the safest children's bike,
the best children's bike ??
What's been the biggest outlet
you've received PR in so far?
Well, the way that we've gotten
most of our sales
online, for example, is,
there's a review site
called Two Wheeling Tots,
and they said
these bikes are truly safer
than what's out there,
and that's lead to, really,
100% of our online sales.
But you're doing it
as a Trojan horse
to get the big guys to play
with you anyways.
L?Let me be very clear
on your mistake ??
Your marketing sucks.
Your PR strategy sucks.
You didn't come in here
telling us
how you were gonna
make parents aware
that they need to be
buying these bikes
for safety reasons, right?
You haven't told us how
you're gonna get there at all.
You haven't told us
about a social?media strategy.
You haven't told us
about giving it to influencers.
This is really what your deal
boils down to ??
Could I forbid you
from making Guardian Bikes?
I could keep you focused
on what has to get done.
In the meantime, you're wasting
your time listening
to Cuban's crap
about building bikes
when he knows there's not
a chance in hell
you'll make money
doing that long term.
They already are.
They're making nothing!
2,000 bikes is nothing.
Let's say if I gave you
500K for 20%,
but you're forbidden
from building bikes.
Yes or no?
Guardian Bikes.
But it comes
with a big contingency.
Let's say if I gave you
500K for 20%,
but you're forbidden
from building bikes.
Yes or no?
Corcoran:
Gosh. [ Laughs ]
You could tell him
to take a walk.
I don't want you spending
any of your time
competing in the
bicycle manufacturing business.
All of your time
should be spent
focusing on getting
the OEM license.
You need adult supervision.
You can't keep doing this.
You can't spend your time
building bikes
and selling them
one at a time.
Imagine the power of an adult
making you focus
on what it's gonna take
to make you rich.
[ Laughs ]
Why don't you take ??
I just want to focus these guys
on concrete answers.
Yeah.
So what I can't get a straight
answer from you guys on is,
is this really
the smartest decision?
You're gonna go through
all the headache
of being in a bike?manufacturing
company
and everything you're gonna need
to do in terms of design
and promotion and marketing
and all that stuff.
Is it because you're able
to capture more share
than the $4 you're gonna make
in a royalty per unit?
That's what
I'm struggling with.
To give you an example,
REI sells SureStop?equipped
bikes already
in every one of their REI stores
on their house brand.
But that's only
about 4,000 bikes a year,
so you make four bucks off
4,000 bikes a year.
It doesn't create
enough revenue.
So we needed
a Trojan horse,
we needed our own bike brand,
and this is what we're doing.
Proof of concept business.
Exactly, exactly.
Yep.
You're at a fork in a road.
One road,
you can see down the road.
The sun is shining, butterflies
are flying in the breeze,
beautiful flowers
are blooming.
The other road,
straight into hell
in perpetuity.
Guardian is
the road to hell.
The other one is you simply wait
out the manufacturers,
get as much PR around ??
Yeah, it's ??
Exactly.
Elon Musk will tell you
he's building the car
for his battery business,
right,
and proof of concept
to demonstrate the technology.
I made an offer.
It's 500K for 20%,
but I personally take Guardian
behind the barn and shoot it.
You don't spend
any time on that.
I've identified
the path to success.
You should listen to me.
I'm absolutely right.
Cuban's 100% wrong.
I'm never wrong.
And so,
at the end of the day,
I'm the only offer
you've got.
It's time
to make a decision.
Riley: Is there another offer
on the table from ??
from either
Lori or Chris?
I was thinking, the only way
this is appealing to me
is if we buy the patent.
I do a lot of manufacturing.
Okay, that's it, guys.
I'm out.
The size of your product alone
makes it difficult.
My offer's pulled back.
Good luck with the other Sharks.
Ohh.
I don't like the disrespect
you've given me.
Kevin, we're ??
we're open to your offer.
We're just trying
to listen ??
We're trying to be respectful
to the other Sharks.
Good luck with you.
Sacca: Look, growing up,
I know there are
three rules to life ??
never go to bed
without flossing,
never text while driving,
and never, ever get involved
in something
this capital intensive,
right?
My great granny told me
those three rules.
Chris, I?I hear ya.
So, I haven't seen
a clear path to that yet.
I'm tapping the brake.
I'm out.
What I'm feeling here is,
is that there is
some problem with getting <i>them</i>
to put this on every bike.
And so, unfortunately,
because that didn't happen,
I'm gonna go with my gut,
and I'm out.
Okay, I'm gonna make you
an offer, guys,
but there's
a lot of contingencies.
Well...
Okay.
Cuban:
The contingencies are,
between Guardian Bikes
and SureStop Technology.
We think we can make
the whole thing successful,
and he's gonna be a
great partner to help
us reach our goals.
I'm actually sad
for you,
because I just saw you turn down
the wrong road into hell.
Bye, Mark. Bye.
Never gonna see him again.
When I talk to my grandkids ??
"I knew Mark Cuban."
"Where's he now, Daddy?"
[ Laughs ]
"He's in hell."
[ Laughter ]
