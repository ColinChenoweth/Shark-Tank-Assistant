?How much does it sell for?
It sells for $24.
Does it ?? $24?
?Yes, it does.

?For a single glass, yes.
We haven't had any pushback

Regan: I know.
Hey, Kevin,
would you be interested

?They slashed you in half.
?Here's the thing.
Shannon: Okay.
Oh, just to beat
the hell out of Kevin.
?Yeah!
?Okay.
?Oh, that's always exciting!
?You will sell nothing.
