Well, for you, Robert,
we are having a Sauvignon Blanc.
?Thank you.
?Make sure to take a lid.
?Which is Lori's?
?Lori's is the Pinot Noir.
?This one?
?Turquoise. Yes.
?Turquoise.
?Yes, here you go.
?Thank you.
?Hang on.
I have to
give you a lid, Lori.
?Yes.
?'Cause you spill everything.
[ Chuckles ]
And for Mr. Kevin,
we have Cabernet.
For Daymond, you have
that Zinfandel. Make
sure to take a lid.
?Ah, this is a Zinfandel?
?Yeah.
And we saved
the best for last.
?Mad Dog 20/20?
?Mad Dog 20/20!
What?! [ Laughs ]
So, what type of glass
is it,
and how easy is it
to break?
Of course. How can you not
know that, Robert?
When you actually
put your hand on the glass,
it transfers the heat
of the body into the wine...
Yes.
...and releases the beautiful
nectars into your nose.
Yeah! [ Laughs ]
Okay, ladies, I'm gonna give you
the benefit of the doubt
?Yes.
?Yes, we do.
?Wow.
You better be selling
one ton of Goverres.
So we are, actually.
?Well, do tell.
?Yes. Yes.
So we've sold, this year so far,
$384,000 worth of glasses.
?Good for you.
?Wow.
We're on track
to sell $500,000.
Where are you selling these?
?We sell them ??
?We sell them online.
is we have a really strong,
robust patent.
You have a patent?
Well, a utility patent
that's soon to be issued.
?Issued?
?On what?
On ?? We're gonna be
the only company
that can put a drink?through lid
on a concave glass.
When you say "concave,"
do you mean the fact that it ??
So that it comes up.
?That it has the shape.
?Yes.
And it narrows
at the top.
It's just putting
a sippy cup kind of top on it?
So we've left the patent
broad enough
to where we can put any spout
or vessel or drinking mechanism
through the lid.
But you won't sell me,
that's the problem.
[ Chuckles ]
of your business.
That's the problem.
But, you know,
three Sharks get impatient.
Robert, Lori, Mark...
we'd love
to do business with you.
[ Cheering ]
[ Laughter ]
Cuban: Congratulations.
You guys are great.
?Amazing.
?Yay!
?Congratulations.
?Thank you so much!
?Thank you so much!
I'm Dr. Rob Yonover
from Honolulu, Hawaii.
My company is See Rescue,
and I'm looking for $200,000
for 20%.
I'm a Ph. D. scientist
that works on volcanoes.
I surf big waves,
and I fish in rough water.
I'm always on the edge of dying.
If anything
ever happened to you,
this is what you'd look like
when you're lost at sea.
That's you.
It happens all the time ??
not just on water,
but land, too.
In fact, there's three people
lost at sea every day
and seven lost hikers a day.
What?
That's why I invented
the See Rescue streamer.
See Rescue
is a visual locating device
that makes you
a large visible target,
and it works on land and water.
Kevin, can you help me demo it?
?Sure.
?Excellent.
Yeah,
can you get lost?
Yeah.
[ Laughter ]
Just walk back
the other way.
Yonover:
This is the See Rescue streamer.
And that's as long as the one
that Kevin just rolled out.
That's the same exact one.
Well, that makes sense
to me.
?Yeah, for sure.
?Why <i>wouldn't</i> you want this?
Got it.
Every other device ??
smoke, flare, sea dye ??
It all runs away.
Lasts seconds or minutes.
This is the only
continuous signaling device.
This has saved
four lives already,
and I need your help...
?Good for you.
...to save 4,000 more.
And one of the guys that I saved
thanked me.
And that was better
than any money that I've made
from this already.
You've got
two sizes there.
Right.
These are the military versions.
This is
the fighter?pilot version.
Do you have military
that are buying these now?
These are patented,
military?approved,
and sold all over the world.
Dr. Rob, that $15 million
over what period of time?
15 years.
So, Dr. Rob,
can I see that prop?
These are
water?soluble plastic.
Cuban: Let ??
Let me see. Yeah.
I have products
for you guys.
Is this new,
or that's what
you've already been selling?
?Yeah, we sell it all.
?Gotcha.
?Let me give Lori hers.
?Thank you.
For boating, hiking ??
That's the other thing.
That's all the applications.
?It's super smart...
?Thank you.
...'cause people do get lost.
Absolutely.
?This is serious stuff.
?Thank you, Dr. Rob.
You want
to do a deal, Dr. Rob,
that just supports
consumer retail sales.
I want it all.
This ?? For the first time,
it's available, whole thing.
You want to start it fresh
in the Shark Tank...
?Exactly.
?... with a new deal
that goes after the military
<i>and</i> the consumer.
Correct.
So like a rebirth.
I was a big boater
for many, many years, right?
Okay.
And you're always afraid
something's gonna go wrong
on the boat and so on.
?Absolutely.
I had
the little GPS device.
?Sure.
?You could put it on your body.
Well, that's a misconception
that all you need
is the electronics.
First of all, electronics fail.
This is no batteries,
chemicals, or electronics.
There's nothing
to go wrong in this.
But what do sales
look like?
They were $200,000 last year,
$250,000 this year.
Have sales dropped off
from the military
because they rely
on GPS only now?
And, Dr. Rob,
what do you need the money for?
I want to get
the big military contracts.
In parallel,
I want to go for the mandate.
That's the key.
These should be
on every life jacket.
Every life jacket
has floatation,
but it should have visibility,
too.
So what does it cost?
$78 for the little one.
$118 for the big one.
I like the idea but only
from what you're telling me ??
how many lives saved.
how much business you did.
Right.
But the real play here is,
you know,
continue with
the government,
and, uh,
I can't help you with this.
So I'm out.
Okay.
Fair enough. Thank you.
I think
it's a great idea,
but it's a really difficult
journey to start from scratch
and try to go into
the mass?retail market.
It would require
a lot of things.
Cuban: Dr. Rob, let me
explain something here.
Everybody's been saying
the product is great,
and I agree with them.
From an investor's
perspective...
Sure.
...th?there's multiple things
I have to consider.
One is
how much work's involved.
The second
is how big can it be.
But something like a mandate ??
If ?? If it can be
argued effectively
that this should be
on every life jacket ??
But that's a very
binary decision, right?
So, yeah, maybe that could
take you to $10 million,
$15 million, $20 million
in sales or more...
?Right.
?... but you've already
got that ability
to sell that yourself,
right?
I'm not gonna come in
and convince the military
any better
than you can.
But money can drive the team
that can build it.
But you're only asking
$200,000.
That money's only gonna go
so far.
I think
it's a great business.
I'm just not quite sure
I could scale it large enough
to give me
the return on investment.
?I'm out.
?Thank you.
Dr. Rob,
I look at it
in terms of what can I add
in value.
I think you nailed it
when you said it's a rebirth.
It's starting
from scratch.
It needs infrastructure.
It needs marketing.
It needs digital.
It needs social media.
Needs it all.
I like to think of my money
as gasoline.
?Right.
?Setting stuff on fire.
And then I participate
in the upside.
That's what
I'm good at.
That's not
the case here.
This requires a significant
more amount of work.
It's not for me.
I'm out.
Okay.
?Thanks for your time.
?Thanks, Dr. Rob,
and let me just say,
thank you for your knowledge
and thank you
for the lives you've saved.
It's not often we get
a vulcanologist coming in.
I wish I had more time
to pick your brain.
Any time. Give me a call.
[ Laughter ]
See you, guys.
That was disappointing.
I'm disappointed
I didn't get a deal,
but I hope at least
it gets out there
the knowledge of this existence,
and it'll save lives.
And that feels better
than money, anyway.
Narrator: Next in the tank
are entrepreneurs
hoping to create a huge brand
from a special asset.
Which was a problem for me.
Our U. S. manufacturer
couldn't scale.
I took on a strategic partner.
We took it overseas, cut
the cost of this bag in half,
and then we started getting
a lot of requests
from mass?market and retailers
and so forth for a product
that could fit in, say,
the largest retailer
in the world.
Walmart asked you for a version,
and was it $49 or $19.99?
They wanted to put it
on the shelf for $39.
?[ Laughs ]
?Okay, there you go.
So it's not this fabric,
obviously.
It's not this fabric.
?And what's your cost?
?But what's the...?
So we got our cost
to sub $15 for that product.
I have the prototype here
if you would like to take a ??
?No problem.
?I didn't mean
to disrespect you.
?He's getting something?
It was our ?? the one
for the mass?market bag.
So after Kickstarter, we rolled
on to Indiegogo that same day,
and within 60 days
of launching this product,
we raised over $1 million.
?Ohh!
?Ohh!
?What?!
?Fast?forward today ??
Our sales are at $1.4 million.
?Well, hang on.
?Including Kickstarter?
Hang on, your sales through
Indiegogo and Kickstarter ??
$800,000 and then $1 million?
Or did you do $800,000 ??
So it was $855,000
and then another $500,000.
the slashing problem
was out like that.
If you're going to places
that people are slashing stuff
He looks at me, and he says,
"You know, Robert,
everybody has a game plan
until you get hit in the face."
You haven't been proven
by the reality
of the marketplace yet.
I'm out.
Okay, let me tell you about
getting kicked in the face
and kind of what
I'm all about
and why we're going
to be successful.
Literally
four weeks ago yesterday,
I was diagnosed with cancer ??
a really nasty, nasty one.
I wasn't sure if
I was even going to be able
to make it here.
Since then,
I've had two surgeries.
The first two weeks of
getting diagnosed with cancer,
?I'll do that deal.
?Yeah, Robert. Smart man.
I'll do that deal all day long.
?Let's do it.
?Do we have a deal?
?Do it.
?Wow!
?Yeah, we have a deal!
?Yeah!
Good job, Robert.
I'm sitting here and thinking,
"Why wouldn't he take that deal?
That's incredible."
?I never send my dough out
unless I get returns ever.
All right,
good luck, guys.
?Thank you.
?Good luck.
?Good luck, guys.
?Appreciate it.
Whoo!
Whoo!
Yeah, baby!
Oh, my God!
I didn't see
that coming at all.
Whoa!
I really thought Robert was ??
just had no interest.
No.
He laid there in the woods,
waiting, and then at the end
of the deal, he pounced.
That was incredible.
We couldn't have been happier.
We wanted Robert
from the moment
we started talking
about the show.
So that's just awesome.
Yeah.
