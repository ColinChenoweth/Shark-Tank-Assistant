?I'm Shannon.
?And I'm Regan.
Shannon: And we're
from San Diego, California.
Come on, James!
We're two busy moms
always on the go.
Regan: Shannon and I met at
our kids' preschool field trip.
After a long day
with 40 4?year?olds,
we were ready
for a glass of wine.
[ Both cheering ]
We dropped our kids off
with our husbands,
and we've been friends
ever since.
Regan and I both worked
in corporate America
for several years,
and it came
a point in our lives
where we just wanted
to do something different.
Every couple of weeks,
Regan and I would meet
for happy hour,
but once we started
talking about moving directions
in our careers,
our happy hours
turned into business meetings.
And we came up with an idea
that we loved.
So we decided to start
a business together.
Thank you.
I'll take this one.
Our product seems to be
flying off store shelves.
Retailers are starting
to get frustrated
that we can't keep up
with the demand for the product.
We're starting to get
bigger orders,
Hi,
I'm Regan Kelaher.
And I'm Shannon Zappala.
Our company is Goverre,
and we're here today
seeking $200,000
for a 13% stake in our business.
So we believe that everything
is better with wine.
?Yes.
?Wine at the park.
Wine on a picnic.
Wine at a pitch meeting
with investors.
It's not gonna spill
when Shannon knocks it.
?Again?
?I know. I'm sorry.
I have a habit
of knocking it over.
[ Chuckling ]
Goverre is chic.
Goverre is durable.
And did we mention
Goverre holds
17 ounces
of your favorite wine?
That's 17 ounces?
Yes, and that's
half a bottle of wine.
?That's half a bottle.
?That's half a bottle of wine.
So say goodbye to using
plastic cups that spill,
and say hello
to Goverre.
Now, Sharks,
which one of you
is ready to catch
the Goverre buzz?
?Yeah.
?Yes!
?Who's ready for some wine?
?Buzz.
?Yeah.
All right.
Herjavec: So it's a sippy cup
for wine?
?Exactly.
?Basically.
?Yes.
?It's an adult sippy cup.
What kind of wine
are we drinking, Shannon?
Shannon: Well,
it's a white soda?lime glass,
and it's about twice as thick
as your typical wine glass.
So it's very durable.
And then
with the silicone sleeve,
it adds that extra protection.
?It works.
?It works. It does.
?Of course. Of course it does.
?Yes.
Why ?? Why would somebody
need to carry this?
So it's great for when you want
to take a glass of wine
out on your boat,
to a picnic,
to a concert
in the park
Shannon: We're in
about 300 retail shops.
?What type?
?Specialty or big?box?
Specialty.
But we did just recently
receive a purchase order
from the Container Store
for 9,000 units.
?Oh, congratulations.
?How much does it sell for?
It sells for $24.
Does it ?? $24?
?Yes, it does.
?For a single glass?
?$24 a glass?
?For a single glass, yes.
We haven't had any pushback
on the price.
?It's a great ??
?No?
?Nope.
No, not really.
It's a great price point.
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.
That's impressive.
For gifting.
What does it cost you
to make it?
$5.50 landed.
O'Leary: So, what's sales
gonna be this calendar year?
This calendar year, we're at
$384,000 worth of sales.
And how much
are you making on that?
Right now we're at $134,000
in net profit.
?Good for you.
?After you've paid yourself?
?That's so impressive.
?So ??
?Thank you.
?After you've paid yourself?
We are not
paying ourselves.
Everything we ?? we make
goes back into the business.
So if you paid yourselves each
as a normalized salary,
you'd be breaking even.
It's a good hobby.
Is there anything proprietary
about this?
?Oh, yeah.
?Why's it worth $1.5 million?
One of our most exciting
features about Goverre
So, Regan and Shannon,
I'm a beer and vodka drinker.
You can put anything
in it.
?Oh, I know.
?[ Chuckles ]
?But, uh, it's not
my space, so ??
?Okay.
?And I can't get excited
about it, so I'm out.
?Yeah, okay.
?Thank you so much.
?Thank you very much, Daymond.
?Appreciate that.
?Have you thought
of making a clear version
so I can see the wine through,
instead of a frosted?
?Interesting that you say that.
?Yes.
We ?? We want to make
a more accessible version
for the bigger stores,
and that's one of the options
on the table.
Okay, listen, guys,
I like it.
I'm gonna
make you an offer.
Okay, great.
I'll give you $200,000
for 33 1/3%.
I'm assuming
you're 50?50 partners.
?Yes, we are.
?We are.
I want a third.
I'm so valuable to this business
it's ridiculous.
It is.
[ Chuckles ]
Oh, God.
Okay,
that's great.
Go.
Boy, they were excited
about that, Kevin!
[ Both laugh ]
Okay.
?Wow! Control yourself, ladies!
?If I were you, I would take it.
I'm really ??
actually ??
Calm down! Calm down!
?[ Laughs ]
?I'm super, super excited.
I'd love to hear what
the other Sharks have to say.
Regan: I know.
Hey, Kevin,
would you be interested
in $200,000
for a 15% stake in our business?
?No.
?No?
?They slashed you in half.
?Here's the thing.
Shannon: Okay.
Oh, just to beat
the hell out of Kevin.
?Yeah!
?Okay.
?Oh, that's always exciting!
?You will sell nothing.
?Oh, oh. I'm in.
?Mark, would you be interested?
?Yeah! Yeah.
?All right.
Okay. Okay.
I'm gonna raise ??
I'm gonna raise my price.
So we will squash you like
the little cockroach you are.
All right, so, Kevin,
would you excuse us?
Yes, Kevin. Leave the room.
[ Laughter ]
?Okay, come here. Hold on.
?[ Clears throat ]
Hold on.
We need to have a moment.
Shannon: This is our dream ??
to be on "Shark Tank,"
and we did it,
and we got a deal
with three Sharks.
?Oh, my gosh.
?Is this happening?
?No.
?No?
