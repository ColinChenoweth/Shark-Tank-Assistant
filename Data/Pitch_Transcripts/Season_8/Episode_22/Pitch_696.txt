Well, for you, Robert,
we are having a Sauvignon Blanc.
?Thank you.
?Make sure to take a lid.
?Which is Lori's?
?Lori's is the Pinot Noir.
?This one?
?Turquoise. Yes.
?Turquoise.
?Yes, here you go.
?Thank you.
?Hang on.
I have to
give you a lid, Lori.
?Yes.
?'Cause you spill everything.
[ Chuckles ]
Of course. How can you not
know that, Robert?
is we have a really strong,
robust patent.
You have a patent?
Well, a utility patent
that's soon to be issued.
?Issued?
?On what?
On ?? We're gonna be
the only company
that can put a drink?through lid
on a concave glass.
When you say "concave,"
do you mean the fact that it ??
So that it comes up.
?That it has the shape.
?Yes.
But you won't sell me,
that's the problem.
[ Chuckles ]
of your business.
That's the problem.
But, you know,
three Sharks get impatient.
Robert, Lori, Mark...
we'd love
to do business with you.

I'm Dr. Rob Yonover
from Honolulu, Hawaii.
My company is See Rescue,
Yonover:
This is the See Rescue streamer.
Dr. Rob, that $15 million
over what period of time?
15 years.
So, Dr. Rob,
can I see that prop?
These are
water?soluble plastic.
Cuban: Let ??
Let me see. Yeah.
I have products
for you guys.
Is this new,
or that's what
you've already been selling?
?Yeah, we sell it all.
?Gotcha.
?Let me give Lori hers.
?Thank you.
For boating, hiking ??
That's the other thing.
That's all the applications.
?It's super smart...
?Thank you.
...'cause people do get lost.
Absolutely.
?This is serious stuff.
?Thank you, Dr. Rob.
You want
to do a deal, Dr. Rob,
that just supports
consumer retail sales.
I want it all.
This ?? For the first time,
it's available, whole thing.
You want to start it fresh
in the Shark Tank...
?Exactly.
?... with a new deal
Cuban: Dr. Rob, let me
explain something here.
Everybody's been saying
the product is great,
Dr. Rob,
I look at it
in terms of what can I add
in value.
I think you nailed it
when you said it's a rebirth.
It's starting
from scratch.
It needs infrastructure.
It needs marketing.
It needs digital.
It needs social media.
Needs it all.
I like to think of my money
as gasoline.
?Right.
?Setting stuff on fire.
?Thanks for your time.
?Thanks, Dr. Rob,
Which was a problem for me.
Our U. S. manufacturer
couldn't scale.
I took on a strategic partner.
We took it overseas, cut
the cost of this bag in half,
?No problem.
?I didn't mean
to disrespect you.
?He's getting something?
It was our ?? the one
for the mass?market bag.
So after Kickstarter, we rolled
on to Indiegogo that same day,
the slashing problem
was out like that.
If you're going to places
that people are slashing stuff
?I'll do that deal.
?Yeah, Robert. Smart man.
I'll do that deal all day long.
?Let's do it.
?Do we have a deal?
?Do it.
?Wow!
?Yeah, we have a deal!
?Yeah!
Good job, Robert.
Whoa!
I really thought Robert was ??
just had no interest.
No.
He laid there in the woods,
We wanted Robert
from the moment
we started talking
about the show.
So that's just awesome.
Yeah.
