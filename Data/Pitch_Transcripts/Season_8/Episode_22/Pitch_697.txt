Hi, I'm
Amanda Latona Kuclo.
And I'm her husband and
business partner, Steve Kuclo.
And our company
is Booty Queen Apparel.
We're seeking $250,000
for 20% stake in our company.
Sharks, in case you didn't know,
butts are back.
Yes!
Now more than ever,
women are hitting the weights
with the hopes
to create a better backside.
Our company was inspired
by my wife's success
in the fitness industry.
Known for her ??
?Oh, wow!
?Beautiful.
?Yeah, I've seen that.
?Hey, now.
Known for her glutes
and inspiring women
all over the world
with her amazing personality
and her signature pose.
?Mm!
?Wait for it.
John: Mm!
[ Laughter ]
Great pose!
Great pose!
Oh, yeah.
Daymond,
he's standing right there.
Introducing
Booty Queen Apparel,
a high?quality fitness
fashion line that fuses comfort,
fit, and fashion
and focuses on,
you guessed it...
the booty.
Our brand marries strength
with glamour,
catering to the woman
that loves building her booty
and loves looking great
while doing it.
Who's ready to add
your assets to ours?
[ Laughs ]
I have to say,
I think you're the biggest man
that's ever
come in here.
?All right.
?That's a good thing.
Hey, I showed you
the gun show, Lori.
[ Laughter ]
Amanda: Lori, that is
the black?and?pink mesh.
Mr. Wonderful, of course,
green for money.
Those will look fabulous
on you.
Herjavec: Thank you.
They're heavy.
And thank you, Daymond,
and Mark.
I thought the purpose
of working out
?No. Not ??
?Not anymore.
?Not today.
Steve:
Most women say that.
Like,
I do a lot of the ??
the back?end stuff
with the company.
?He's the e?mail server.
?I bet you do.
?Ah, back end.
[ Laughter ]
Hey!
So when it comes to that,
you know,
a lot
of the women say,
"Oh, my God,
my butt's never looked so good."
The material ??
It helps shape.
O'Leary: But, Amanda,
it's pure branding.
Amanda: Yes.
There's nothing unique
about the product,
other than
it's stylish.
?You're selling yourself.
?It looks good.
?Selling ourselves ??
But you want to build
this Booty Queen brand.
Amanda, I can buy
similar clothing anywhere.
This is about your brand.
This one's not for me, Amanda.
I'm out.
Thank you, sir.
Guys, like Kevin, it's not
really my core competency.
I'm out.
Herjavec:
Amanda, I've been in this space
for the last year and a half
trying to create a brand
for various people,
working with them.
Brutally difficult.
At the end of the day,
you're really not
in the clothing business.
You're in the "you" business.
?Right.
?Difficult to scale that.
Not for me.
I'm out.
Thank you.
You can help us, Daymond.
That's the thing.
You can take our ideas
and implement them.
I post one video
of me wearing leggings,
doing an exercise
with the apparatus,
and I just sold an outfit,
a training program,
and a piece of equipment
from one website.
She's an influencer.
Daymond is Amanda and Steve's
last chance for a deal for their
body?conscious clothing brand,
Booty Queen.
Amanda: You can help us,
Daymond. That's the thing.
You can take our ideas
and implement them.
I mean, there are a million
pairs of tights out there.
The only way that you can
move out ahead of the crowd
is return buyers who believe
you're an influencer,
and they keep
buying the products.
We do have a lot
of repeat customers.
And...
So it's repeat customers.
Like I said, I put these out
and I used the power
of social media and I said,
"Hey, guys, before we even
run these, before we even put
money out of our pocket,
what do you think?"
I got over 8,000 likes.
That's smart.
We pre?sold so we weren't taking
money out of our own pocket.
And then we sold out
of our presale.
And that's happened twice.
I would normally
sit here and say,
?Steve, pick up Daymond.
?Pick up Daymond!
Pick up Daymond.
[ Laughter ]
?Congrats.
?Thank you, guys.
Oh, my gosh.
Let's go!
We've got booties!
Oh, my gosh, how cool is that?
Oh, my God.
Whoo!
We got Daymond!
Getting a deal with Daymond
is a dream come true.
It's who we came for. It's who
we had our sights set on.
Yeah, he was
the strategic partner we knew
that could really help take
the company to the next level,
scale it, and do exactly
what we want to do.
And we feel this is just
gonna be a perfect match.
Narrator: In Season 7,
we watched Erik Hopperstad
and Brian Brasch make a deal
with Kevin O'Leary
for their business
PRx Performance ??
home gym equipment
that fits in small spaces.
I'll give you
the $80,000 for 20%.
?You got a deal.
?Let's do it.
Let's see what
they're up to now.
