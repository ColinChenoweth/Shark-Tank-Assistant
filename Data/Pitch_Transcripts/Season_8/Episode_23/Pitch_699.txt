Hello, Sharks.
My name's Billy Thompson.
Thompson: Sharks, that's why
we invented a solution
to this embarrassing,
age?old problem ??
an undershirt that completely
blocks underarm sweat.
Choi: It's called
the Thompson Tee,
with Hydro?Shield
sweatproof technology.
We brought a Thompson Tee
for each one of you.
Cool.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Greiner: Thank you.
Yeah.
John: Thank you.
Cuban: Thank you, sir.
Yeah.
Cute.
If you boil it down,
correct.
So, Billy,
it's three layers ??
Now ?? Now,
before you tell us
the sales, because...
Yes.
...a really crazy number here,
but, you know,
I like to get, like ??
You know, I'm romantic.
Don't go into
valuation yet.
Like, you got
to hear the story.
I want to hear the story.
Whoa. Wait a second.
Thompson: Thank you.
Thank you.
You want a $10 million
valuation.
Who's paying more
than 10 times for T?shirts?
Good question.
Patented T?shirts.
Yes.
But, guys, the technology ??
"technology" ??
is fine, right?
It serves the purpose.
But you're really
a marketing company.
Yeah.
That's what you are,
right?
Because you found a niche,
however big it is,
Okay.
Billy, I like it.
I like it. I mean...
Here we go.
...I'm the only guy up here,
you know...
Who doesn't sweat? Yeah.
... wearing an undershirt.
I always wear an undershirt.
I actually think
it's a wider market.
It amazes me that,
looking even up here,
that most guys don't know,
not only for the sweat,
but it makes the outer garment
look better, cleaner.
Some of us are just cooler than
the other side of the pillow.
[ Chuckles ]
But there's risk,
obviously.
Here's what I feel
comfortable with.
Here's the offer
that's not
for their sweat?repelling
shirt company, Thompson Tee.
$700,000, 25%.
Gosh, my offer looks
so much better now.
$700,000 for 25% of the company
puts us at $2.8 million.
Robert, where do you see
the growth in this company?
In what direction would you
advise us to take it?
You know,
my investment is in you guys.
Yeah, it's a T?shirt,
but you guys
are the fabric
of the company.
I'm making
my investment in you.
I'm not gonna tell you
what to do,
but I am gonna give you
some direction.
It's up to you to do
what you want with it.
Continue to do
what you're doing ??
Okay, listen.
I'm getting frustrated
listening to this,
so I'm gonna
put another offer in
just so you have
an alternative.
[ Laughter ]
You're boring me
to death.
I'll give you the $700K
as a loan.
I'll take
the 7% equity now.
I'm gonna charge 18%, which is
what your industry gets paid.
Oh, Lord.
There's an option.
You have no delusion.
Basically, you pay me 7%,
I give you $700,000 loan,
36 months at 18%,
1.5% a month.
I'll do it right now.
I'll give you
Louis' number.
You can just go
down the street.
18% interest?
Absolutely.
I'll do it right now.
Herjavec:
I have no interest in debt.
The way I've made money up here
is by investing
in entrepreneurs,
Thompson: I just can't believe
we got a deal.
'Cause my dad had passed
unexpectedly on Sunday morning,
so I know he'd
be proud right now.
