Hello, Sharks.
My name's Billy Thompson.
Hi. I'm Randy Choi.
We're from Orange County,
California,
and our company
is the Thompson Tee.
We're seeking $700,000 in
exchange for 7% of our business.
[ Laughter ]
Oh, God!
Sharks,
this sucks.
Ew!
This doesn't suck.
[ Chuckles ]
Even one of you Sharks
have experienced
this sucky situation.
[ Laughter ]
Aah!
John: Oh, that is nasty.
No, take it down!
Take it down!
Robert,
give these guys 700 grand.
[ Laughter ]
Thompson: Sharks, that's why
we invented a solution
to this embarrassing,
age?old problem ??
an undershirt that completely
blocks underarm sweat.
Choi: It's called
the Thompson Tee,
with Hydro?Shield
sweatproof technology.
All of our
"raise your hand,
don't let them
see you sweat" shirts
come with an unconditional,
30?day, sweatproof guarantee.
Wear it,
wash it, dry it.
Sweat?free in more ways
than one.
Proudly, our shirts were
handcrafted here in the U. S. A.
So, which one of you Sharks
want to help us
get rid of this sucky situation
once and for all?
We brought a Thompson Tee
for each one of you.
Cool.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Greiner: Thank you.
Yeah.
John: Thank you.
Cuban: Thank you, sir.
Yeah.
Cute.
So, Randy,
wear an undershirt
underneath a great shirt
like this,
it will stop you
from sweating,
and it'll protect
the outer garment.
Correct.
Correct.
What's the difference
between the one
I'm wearing right now
and yours?
Well,
look in the armpit.
Yeah,
look at the armpit.
This is,
like, triple?layered.
No.
No, no, no.
They have a Kotex
underneath the armpit.
[ Laughter ]
That's the difference.
But you're just
a basic undershirt
with padding.
Correct.
It fees like,
in the entire underarm,
you've reinforced...
It feels like a...
...and put, like,
three layers of fabric.
What you had to do is,
you can't just slap
a waterproof material
against your skin.
It'll actually
exacerbate the problem.
So we had to come out
with a way to mitigate
that thermal heat
transfer.
But it's just three layers
of cotton, right?
No, that's incorrect.
Inside, the inner layer
is an ultra?thin,
four?way stretch,
compound polymer,
medical?grade film
that allows
vapor to pass through...
Oh, really?
...but will block moisture.
So there is something
proprietary in this?
Absolutely. We do have
a patent on the product.
So, you've created
an armpit diaper
for people that really sweat
profusely.
Basically.
Pretty much, yeah.
If you boil it down,
correct.
So, Billy,
it's three layers ??
Now ?? Now,
before you tell us
the sales, because...
Yes.
...a really crazy number here,
but, you know,
I like to get, like ??
You know, I'm romantic.
Don't go into
valuation yet.
Like, you got
to hear the story.
I want to hear the story.
Randy, tell us the story.
Now tell us the story.
Yeah.
Well, I mean,
it goes way back.
I mean, I was in 7th grade,
and I pitted out.
That's way back, man.
Yeah.
I'd prefer you started
in grade 1.
[ Laughter ]
Well...
7th grade mattered,
because that's when...
Maybe in the womb.
Puberty ??
That's when it happens.
So, I reached out
to Randy.
Randy and I
were kind of mutual friends.
I knew he was in
the apparel business.
I grew up
in the apparel industry.
And it turned out
that he actually had
a form of hyperhidrosis,
which, by the way,
is the clinical term
for excessive sweat.
He knew exactly
what I was doing,
and he became passionate
about it,
'cause he understood,
and he partnered with me.
What percentage of people
have that problem?
1.5% have this problem,
and then another 35% deal with
it on a situational basis.
Randy,
agree with me on this.
Yes.
99% of the guys,
if they simply wore
an undershirt,
it would get rid of
some of the sweat.
It will definitely get rid
of some of the sweat.
Some. Some.
Correct.
Well,
here's a good example ??
you,
in that picture.
You say
you always wear one.
But I was doing
incredible exercise.
[ Laughter ]
Or is this for people
with a serious sweat problem?
It's for the 35%
of the population
that's buying clinical?strength
antiperspirant
for those situational meetings,
weddings,
first dates, job interviews,
and this stuff
is not working
for them.
How much does it cost?
It comes in two different ??
two different lines.
We have the original fit,
which fits
like a traditional undershirt,
and then we have the slim fit,
which fits more
to the contours of the body.
Right. How much?
Original fit is $24.99.
The bamboo line
is $29.99.
What's your cost
to make them?
We average about $8.50.
Herjavec:
How do you sell them?
We sell everything
direct to consumer,
online, at our website
and then also on Amazon.
And your sales are...?
On year 1,
we did $90,000.
Year 2, we did
half a million dollars.
Year 3,
we did $1 million.
And year 4,
we did $2 million.
Wow.
Year?to?date,
we are at $2.6 million,
on pace
to do $4 million.
What are you making
on the $2.6 million?
25%.
I'm surprised.
You're not crazy, then.
Whoa. Wait a second.
Thompson: Thank you.
Thank you.
You want a $10 million
valuation.
Who's paying more
than 10 times for T?shirts?
Good question.
Patented T?shirts.
Yes.
But, guys, the technology ??
"technology" ??
is fine, right?
It serves the purpose.
But you're really
a marketing company.
Yeah.
That's what you are,
right?
Because you found a niche,
however big it is,
and you figured out
how to digitally market,
retain your margin,
and you continue
to grow your
customer base.
And you're killing it.
So, the main question becomes ??
you're making money,
you got expertise in
manufacturing and in sales ??
what are you here for?
Well, we'd like
the capital to bring
our production
in?house.
How much would you lower your
cost if you brought it in?house?
We estimate about
$2 to $2.50.
Why do you want to take
that time
to then take on
the manufacturing?
Because then you're
gonna lose time
doing what you're doing best ??
getting out to the customer.
Cuban: 'Cause then you're gonna
go through the ??
you're gonna go through
that learning curve,
and just managing
all those people
and dealing with those hassles
that come with it.
Yeah.
Herjavec: Randy,
I don't have a problem
with you wanting
to bring it in.
I get it. $2 on an $8 item ??
that's a huge margin.
Right.
Here's my only disconnect.
Not to be a Kevin,
but you're asking
for 2 1/2 times your revenue
as a valuation.
How do you get to
a $10 million value today?
Because of the ??
the size of the market,
the historical growth,
the lack of alternatives.
But the truth is,
you can spin the story
any way you want,
but in the end, it's a T?shirt.
I'm out.
I normally would say that you're
crazy about the valuation here,
but I'm not mad at you
for asking for that amount.
But my biggest challenge...
is inventory.
Taking on
that whole process
of warehousing
and buying machines...
I really don't want
to be in that space.
I don't want to go down
that path with you, so I'm out.
Gotcha.
Okay.
Under?? Understood.
Guys, one of the challenges
sometimes for entrepreneurs
is knowing what business
they're truly in.
The reality is
you're a marketing company.
If you would've come here
and said, "$700K,
we're getting 2x
on every dollar we spend,
and so we think, with $700K,
we can increase that
and go to the next level and get
3x on every dollar we spend,"
that would've
been different.
That would've been
an acknowledgement ??
"Yeah, we truly are
a great marketing company."
And this is what scares me
about you guys.
I'm out.
Understood.
Okay.
Billy, I like it.
I like it. I mean...
Here we go.
...I'm the only guy up here,
you know...
Who doesn't sweat? Yeah.
... wearing an undershirt.
I always wear an undershirt.
I actually think
it's a wider market.
It amazes me that,
looking even up here,
that most guys don't know,
not only for the sweat,
but it makes the outer garment
look better, cleaner.
Some of us are just cooler than
the other side of the pillow.
[ Chuckles ]
But there's risk,
obviously.
Here's what I feel
comfortable with.
Here's the offer
that's not
gonna make me sweat
and stay up at night.
[ Laughs ]
I'll give you the $700,000
for 25%.
Ouch.
Right in the middle
of the range.
Am I wrong, Kevin?
Nope.
That's a reasonable offer,
and you will never
get a better one
than that.
Greiner: Okay. You're obviously
doing a great business,
and it's working.
The interesting thing to me,
being in the TV industry
for so long,
when you put on certain fabrics,
like silk or satin,
they don't breathe,
and it's a nightmare.
Right.
And so I can relate
to what it is.
I love it, but can I get
really excited about it?
This is a tough one,
guys.
You came in asking
for a lot.
You'd be shocked.
You'd be shocked
with these testimonials
that come in every day.
Being in the apparel industry
for as long as I have,
it's the first time I actually
worked with a brand and product
that's actually
helping people.
It's a pretty, uh...
I love you guys,
I like the product,
but I'm out.
Bam! [ Laughs ]
Whoa.
Wow.
But all is not lost.
1 Shark, 2 Shark, 3 Shark,
4 Shark out.
[ Exhales sharply ]
Narrator:
Four Sharks are out.
Billy and Randy
only have one offer
on the table from Robert
for their sweat?repelling
shirt company, Thompson Tee.
$700,000, 25%.
Gosh, my offer looks
so much better now.
$700,000 for 25% of the company
puts us at $2.8 million.
Robert, where do you see
the growth in this company?
In what direction would you
advise us to take it?
You know,
my investment is in you guys.
Yeah, it's a T?shirt,
but you guys
are the fabric
of the company.
I'm making
my investment in you.
I'm not gonna tell you
what to do,
but I am gonna give you
some direction.
It's up to you to do
what you want with it.
Continue to do
what you're doing ??
Okay, listen.
I'm getting frustrated
listening to this,
so I'm gonna
put another offer in
just so you have
an alternative.
[ Laughter ]
You're boring me
to death.
I'll give you the $700K
as a loan.
I'll take
the 7% equity now.
I'm gonna charge 18%, which is
what your industry gets paid.
Oh, Lord.
There's an option.
You have no delusion.
Basically, you pay me 7%,
I give you $700,000 loan,
36 months at 18%,
1.5% a month.
I'll do it right now.
I'll give you
Louis' number.
You can just go
down the street.
18% interest?
Absolutely.
I'll do it right now.
Herjavec:
I have no interest in debt.
The way I've made money up here
is by investing
in entrepreneurs,
doing the operations,
and growing the business.
My offer is $700,000,
25%.
I just want to do
the equity.
You guys...
You guys have to make
a decision,
or I'm gonna invoice you
18% for my time.
[ Laughter ]
You got a deal.
All right.
[ Applause ]
Dang.
Congrats, Robert.
Robert.
Congrats, guys.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Guys, congrats.
Thank you.
Appreciate that.
He would've taken 20%.
[ Laughter ]
Can always counter.
All right.
Should've countered.
All right, guys.
Okay, I'll do it at 17%.
[ Laughter ]
Congrats, guys.
Good luck.
Thompson: I just can't believe
we got a deal.
'Cause my dad had passed
unexpectedly on Sunday morning,
so I know he'd
be proud right now.
[ Voice breaking ]
And I just, you know...
I wish he could've
physically been here to ??
to see this,
but I know
he's here in spirit,
without a doubt.
Narrator: In season 7,
Wombi Rose and John Wise
made a deal with Kevin O'Leary
for their pop?up
greeting?card company
lovepop.
Spectacular. And I have so many
customers that would buy this.
Let's see
what's happening now.
Rose: Business has been popping
since "Shark Tank."
We just sold our
millionth lovepop card.
Wise: Prior to "Shark Tank,"
we had done
$300,000 in a year
and a half.
It's now been a year,
and we've done
$8.7 million in sales.
The growth
has been incredible.
We now have 200 people
working at lovepop.
Hey, guys, how are you?
I'm in Boston today,
so I came over to see
the lovepop guys.
They want to show me
something brand?new.
Wow.
These look very different
than anything else
you guys have done.
In every award show,
there's always
that magic moment ??
"The envelope, please."
And I thought to myself,
"Why isn't that a lovepop card?"
I know the people that produce
the Billboard Music Awards.
I put them together,
and magic.
Oh, wow.
The Billboard Music Awards
are gonna be
on ABC on May 21st,
so this is
a fantastic opportunity
to get lovepop
out there.
When the winner's
announced,
not only will the audience
hear who has won,
they'll see who's won
in a lovepop.
This could be very good
for the brand.
I invested in lovepop
for two reasons.
Number one, they took something
old and made it new again,
but the team,
Wombi and John,
are really delivering
for investors.
$8.7 million in sales ??
That's huge.
I will see you soon.
And you know where?
Billboard Music Awards.
Wise: Starting lovepop
has been
the most rewarding
experience of our lives.
We've learned, we've grown,
and we're continuing to do more.
We had such an amazing
opportunity to build
this company and to have
this experience
that we never
would've imagined.
Who's the Top Artist?
Mr. Wonderful.
Yeah, baby.
[ Laughing ]
Get it.
Get it.
Get it.
Guys to the front.
Girls and guy
in the back.
Whoo!
Man:
We are 20 seconds away.
Cuban: Kabam.
Narrator: Next up is what
the entrepreneurs believe
is the most convenient way
to carry your essentials.
[ Laughing ]
