Hello, Sharks.
My name is Trevor Johnston.
Trevor:
Yeah, I know, I know.
Oh, wow.
You guys are thinking,
"These guys are crazy
if they think they're gonna
get that valuation
over a belt buckle."
Yes.
But trust us, Sharks.
The belt buckle ??
the Wallet Buckle
Trevor, can you ??
Trevor:
I've been literally touring
the entire country.
Every single weekend,
it's been a major
country?music festival
the last four months.
You know, when you guys
came in here,
I was skeptical
about the valuation.
[ Laughs ]
Given what you've said...
They've done themselves
a cruel disservice.
Justin: They missed out
on a huge opportunity
