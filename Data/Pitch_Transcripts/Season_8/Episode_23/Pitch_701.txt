Hello, Sharks.
My name is Trevor Johnston.
And I'm Justin Johnston.
We're brothers and best friends
from Northern California.
And we're the creators
of the Wallet Buckle.
We're seeking $500,000
for a 10% equity in our company.
[ Chuckling ]
Wow.
Trevor:
Yeah, I know, I know.
Oh, wow.
You guys are thinking,
"These guys are crazy
if they think they're gonna
get that valuation
over a belt buckle."
Yes.
But trust us, Sharks.
The belt buckle ??
the Wallet Buckle
should be approached
as a brand?new
fashion accessory,
never before seen,
and we're taking
the nation by storm.
[ Chuckling ]
Imagine this.
Go out to your
favorite music festival
or at your favorite
sporting event...
Cuban.
...pop in line,
grab some food and a drink,
and the terror
sets in.
"Where's my credit card?
How am I
gonna pay for this?"
Don't be that guy ??
that guy holding up the line,
that guy everyone is cursing
under their breaths.
Both: Well, not anymore!
With the Wallet Buckle,
you are now able to access
your cards and I. D. quicker
than any other form of payment.
Wait for it.
Wait for it.
Wait for it.
Both: Boom!
Boom.
Still not convinced?
Fine.
What if your girlfriend's
literally attached at your hip?
[ Laughs ]
I don't even need to put
my girlfriend down
to buy her next drink.
I just whip
my card out.
[ Laughter ]
And the love
never stops.
Kevin.
The Wallet Buckle
will allow you to carry
up to five cards safely
and securely
right inside
your belt buckle.
But even if you have one card,
they are all tension?held,
so they're
not gonna fall out.
So even if you have one card,
just slides right in...
and doesn't fall out.
Once you wear a Wallet Buckle,
you'll wonder why
you've never worn
a Wallet Buckle before,
which is why we've brought
you all your very own,
as my assistant,
Sexy Sam,
will bring your
very own Wallet Buckle.
I need that rhinestone
one on you.
John: You know,
I've never seen...
Thank you, Sexy Sam.
...anybody laugh
at their own pitch so much.
All right, which one's
the rhinestone?
[ Laughing ]
We like to have fun.
Thank you.
So, these buckles,
as you'll see,
they are ?? They'll go on
any snap?on belt,
so most ??
most stores that actually
already sell belt straps
love this idea
just because they're
already selling belt straps,
so you can actually mix
and match your belt straps.
Herjavec: So, I ?? I ??
Great presentation.
Great schtick.
It's actually
a really good product.
It's one of those
that makes me say,
"Why hasn't anybody
thought of this?"
But there's a big elephant
in the room.
$500,000 for 10%.
Well, when I said we're taking
the nation by storm, I meant it.
I meant it.
So, we just started selling ??
The very first event
was at Stagecoach,
which is a big country?music
festival right out here
in Southern California,
last year.
So it's been
about 18 months, so ??
and we've sold upwards of
about 15,000 units.
Trevor, can you ??
And how much are you selling
them for at ?? at ??
Between $40 and $95.
15,000 units last year.
What are the total sales?
No, not last year.
Last year,
we did only $250,000 in sales.
This year, to date,
we're already over $500,000
and projecting close to $800,000
by the end of the year.
It sounds good.
So let's go through one.
What's the average cost
of a buckle?
What does it cost you to make,
and what do you sell them for?
So, any of just the colored ones
right here are $49.95.
All right, so let's take
one of those, $49.
What does it
cost you to make?
Currently, about $7
but it can be as low as $5.
What's the breakdown
of sales?
Where have you
been selling them?
About 80% of the sales
are done in live events,
and when I say "live events,"
it's festivals,
it's concerts,
rodeos.
So, Justin,
can we go through next year's
optimistic sales scenario?
Tell me,
as good as it can get,
what revenues are gonna be
if everything works out.
Absolutely.
So, we just got picked up
by one of the largest denim
retailers in the country ??
Well, just give me a number.
I don't need the adjectives.
I think we're gonna
be $2.5 million, $3 million.
Let's make it $3 million.
Yeah, what would
your margin be on that?
I want to hear
about that retailer.
Who was it?
Buckle.
I've never heard
of Buckle.
So what kind of store is this,
and what do they sell?
They sell, I believe,
two out of every three pair
of denim in the country.
O'Leary: You got $3 million
in sales.
What are we making, pre?tax,
on this business?
$450,000?
Yeah, $450,000.
Why the lederhosen?
[ Chuckles ]
I mean, you can't not
have fun in this, right?
Is that the buckle
you wear all the time?
Yeah, I had this belt custom
made, actually...
'Cause it attracts a lot of
attention and questions?
as well, to match, so...
Looks good, right?
Yeah, I like it.
[ Laughter ]
I missed that.
Would you do that again?
[ Laughter ]
O'Leary: When you display
the buckle in Buckles,
how does anybody know
that it stores credit cards?
So, we opened our first kiosk
in the mall
to get Buckle's
attention.
So, I moved out to Nashville
three months ago,
and I told the mall in there ??
I did, really. There it is.
And so I literally moved out
to Nashville,
and I told the mall,
"I want my kiosk
to be right
in front of Buckle.
Do you have to pay
to put that kiosk in?
$67 a day.
$67 a day.
So you have
this in malls.
That's the first location.
The second location
opens up in two weeks.
We want to have
at least 40 by June.
O'Leary: Just humor me.
Yeah.
Great year's $3 million
in sales.
You're gonna make $450,000
pre?tax, $300,000 after tax.
You're telling me
this business is worth
$5 million
or about 16 times
what you're gonna make
in a good year.
You think that's a little
aggressive for a belt buckle?
You'd think so.
We have about $1 million
of inventory already.
Why do you have $1 million
of inventory?
We'll blow through that.
We're ready to go.
We're ready to go.
We've done events where we'll do
30 Gs in three days.
Yeah, but between those days,
you have to travel,
you have to set up,
there's a cost.
So that's $200,000,
at cost.
We bought a tour bus.
You bought a tour bus.
A tour bus?
Trevor:
I've been literally touring
the entire country.
Every single weekend,
it's been a major
country?music festival
the last four months.
You know, when you guys
came in here,
I was skeptical
about the valuation.
[ Laughs ]
Given what you've said...
They've done themselves
a cruel disservice.
...and based on all
of the attributes...
You're thinking $10 million,
aren't you, Kevin?
I'm thinking $15 million.
I don't want to take
advantage of you
and get a whopping 10%
for $500K.
It's just so unfair.
I'm out.
[ Laughs ]
Herjavec: You guys
are killing it.
I see you guys
at the Calgary Stampede
or any rodeo
or something like that.
You're gonna kill it.
You're gonna kill it.
But the credit card,
just the size of it,
for a belt buckle,
on a general suit,
is never gonna work.
I?I think
this is pretty limited.
Not for me.
I'm out.
So, here's where I am, guys.
I like the product.
80% of your sales right now
are going through live events,
and that means that you guys
are the salespeople.
I mean,
the schtick is funny.
I'm ready to buy one now
just because
we fall in love with you.
But when you sell now
to kiosks, number one ??
and those are your kiosks? ??
all that inventory's yours.
It's always on the books.
It never comes off the books.
When you sell to retailers,
nobody can tell
what that buckle is.
And the reason I know this
is because I have a company
named Mission Belt,
and I also have a company,
Myself Belts, and unless
the salesperson is wearing it
and they're obsessed with it,
they don't sell.
And that's
the biggest challenge.
So you have a good business
for yourself.
$5 million valuation's
absolutely crazy.
I can't help you
with this.
I'm out.
Guys, look,
I live in Dallas, right?
And in Texas, big belt buckles
are not unusual.
It's not that
there's not a market.
It's just, I don't think
it's a big enough market for ??
for what you're trying to do.
Designing belt buckles
to turn this
into a $50 million company ??
That's gonna be hard.
I'm out.
And then
there was one.
Yeah.
So, my concern is
men wear belts a lot.
They wear pants a lot.
A lot of women are changing up
from dresses,
skirts, pants ??
you know, everything ??
and maybe don't wear belts
that often.
So, while you're doing
a great business,
but because I feel like
it's rather niche,
I'm out.
Hmm.
Thank you, guys.
Good luck, guys.
Congrats.
Justin: They missed out
on a huge opportunity
for a product that's
gonna go big and go viral.
And people are fanatical
about it.
Narrator: Next into the Tank
are veterans
hoping to help farmers
in a war?torn country
by capitalizing
on a rare commodity.
