Hi, Sharks.
I'm Kim.
I'm Emily.
And I'm Keith.
We're from Chicago, Illinois,
and we are Rumi Spice.
Sharks, today,
we are seeking $250,000
in investment in exchange
for 5% of our company.
What do you think about when you
hear the word "Afghanistan"?
Perhaps war,
terrorism, opium.
Those are the reasons
we went to Afghanistan
as U. S. Army soldiers.
I supported Special Operations
on night raids.
I was a Route Clearance
platoon leader,
looking for roadside bombs.
And I was an Afghan
regional expert,
working
with tribal elders.
While we were deployed,
we saw a very different
Afghanistan.
Afghanistan is a land inhabited
by proud people
with a rich culture
and history ??
and covered in fields
of violet?colored flowers.
In these precious
purple flowers
lies the rarest
and most expensive
spice in the world ??
saffron.
It's the queen of all spices
and worth its weight in gold.
In modern?day cooking,
there is not risotto Milanese
or paella that is complete
without saffron.
Sharks,
after 30 years of war,
Afghanistan, once a progressive
and peaceful country,
has been cut off from
the international marketplace.
So, before returning home
from our deployment,
we wanted to figure out a way
to empower these Afghan farmers.
So we built a business,
working directly with them,
and we've now created a market
for premium Afghan saffron.
Now only one
question remains ??
which one of you Sharks
will join our mission
to cultivate peace
and harvest profits
for yourselves and for
our farmers in Afghanistan?
Today, we have prepared
something very special
for you guys to try.
We want to show??
We always love that.
[ Laughter ]
So, we wanted to showcase
the versatility of saffron,
because it's both in savory
and sweet applications.
Herjavec: Thank you.
Mm?hmm.
So, our chef made
a saffron ghee,
like a saffron butter, drizzled
with lemon zest over yogurt.
And on the sweet side,
a saffron?infused honey drop.
And you guys also have
the Rumi saffron gift.
There's 2 grams in there.
I know saffron
from paella.
Yep.
But this almost
smells like tobacco.
So, saffron you might've been
used to is saffron
that's maybe two,
three years old,
and it's lost that sweet smell
of the saffron
that comes fresh
from the harvest.
And where do I get
saffron today
if I don't get it
from Afghanistan?
You can get it from Spain,
although Spain exports a lot
more than it actually grows,
so 90% of the world's saffron
actually comes from Iran.
So when you're buying Spanish
saffron, more than likely,
you're buying
low?quality saffron
that's changed
many hands.
And Afghanistan saffron,
for three years running,
has been named the best?quality
saffron in the world.
How do you trade it?
What does it sell for per ??
per what?
So, on retail,
we sell 1 gram for $18,
and then we also sell
in the restaurants,
so we have it
at $140 per ounce.
Okay. And why is it
so expensive?
It's so expensive because
there's no automation.
It all has to be
hand?processed.
It's insanely
labor?intensive.
It takes 150 hours
of labor
just to produce 1 gram
of saffron.
So, how much does
this bottle sell for, retail?
$35...
Man.
and it cost us $8.30
to make.
Well,
let me ask you something.
The pricing
that you have here,
whether it's the valuation
or whether it's the product,
is ?? it's high,
and that means it's
gonna be a limited market,
and that means you may
or may not be able
to help the people
that you're trying to help.
We're absolutely
a luxury brand, right?
We are at the high end of the
market selling premium saffron.
But what we do
with the money that we make
is we reinvest
that profit
back into the infrastructure
in Afghanistan.
We are definitely in it
to make money.
We are a for?profit company,
but we really believe
that making a difference
is also important
and that we want to
have a positive impact
on the people
of Afghanistan.
O'Leary:
What are your sales?
We've made $400,000
in sales so far.
We've projected $750,000
this year.
Wow.
So tell us about the sales
of saffron in the United States.
In the United States,
it's a little over
$60 million,
so it's not big.
Way bigger
than I thought.
Well, how do you compare it
to another spice?
The spice market is about,
I think,
over $10 billion,
so it's a very small part of it,
but it's
the highest?grossing.
We're not really
in the spice industry here.
We're talking about building
a brand around saffron
and doing other
saffron?related products.
So you want to turn
this into a brand.
Mm?hmm.
Right.
One, how are you gonna
turn it into a brand,
and, two, who's your primary
customer going to be?
So, we want to reach
the end consumer,
so through our partners
like Blue Apron,
also through speciality
retailers ??
Well, Blue Apron, you're kind
of hidden in there, right?
You're an OEM type ??
No.
It's our story,
it's our packaging.
We're being featured
in their meals.
So, we do want to be
in retail ?? specialty retail.
We have already worked
with Daniel Boulud,
Chef de Cuisine,
to do a Rumi saffron butter.
We have different spice blends
with saffron in them,
and we're looking at things
like saffron tea.
I mean, think about the size
of the tea market.
What do you see as your biggest
political risk?
I don't think there's
a political risk,
because we're operating
with the farmers,
we're giving them an incentive
to produce,
and we're giving them
an incentive
to protect
their investment.
Okay.
Kim, how did you guys meet?
How did you guys meet?
So, Kim and I met during
emergency operations
on Hurricane Sandy recovery
on Manhattan Island.
And the way we started
this business,
I was deployed
to Afghanistan
in one of the most
dangerous provinces.
And I met this farmer,
Haji Yosef,
who was selling
this incredible, vibrant
red spice
called saffron.
At the time, I didn't know
anything about saffron.
I did some research,
I found out Afghanistan
grows the best?quality
saffron in the world.
So I thought,
"Who's better to call
to make this a business
than Kim and Emily?"
who were at
Harvard Business School.
Hang on a sec.
They went
to Harvard Business School?
That's correct.
We went to West Point
together, too.
Just small
accomplishments.
Here's what
I think about it.
First of all,
thank you for your service.
It's an honor.
I love what you're doing.
I really do.
As a PAGE ambassador
and all of us Sharks,
we believe in entrepreneurship
and helping people,
because if you're helping
all these people in Afghanistan,
they're able to feed
their families
with an honest day's living.
So I love that.
My biggest challenge is,
the product is just
too expensive
for the everyday person,
and for that reason,
I'm out.
Greiner:
So, I'm a huge foodie.
I go crazy for truffle ??
truffle anything.
Miller: Yeah.
Truffle.
Truffle oil,
truffle fries.
Saffron, to me, feels like
the equivalent of a truffle...
Exactly.
Exactly it.
Greiner: ...in a spice.
It's expensive,
it's a premium,
and a luxury.
I love you.
I love what you're doing.
The statement's great.
The problem for me is,
I personally
don't like saffron,
so I'm out.
O'Leary: Can I just ask?
Your forecast for this year is
to break even on the $750,000?
Yes, break even.
But, actually, by next month,
we'll be profitable.
And next year, you said you're
going to make $1.5 million.
How much will you make
on that?
I mean, I would estimate
probably 5% net income.
5% pre?tax?
Herjavec:
But, Kim, why?
Why is the margin so low
for such a high?gross margin?
Why is the net margin
so low?
So, I just did
that from comps,
from what I read
from other food and beverage,
but this is, you know ??
this is ??
this is a guess.
I think we can actually
be a lot higher.
And with your help,
we can be.
I got to tell you, Kim,
for a couple of Harvard grads,
I'm a little surprised
you don't have your model
nailed down
a little more.
They do.
No, they don't.
Greiner: Well, Kim,
let me ask you this.
No, they don't.
Yes, we are Harvard grads,
but we're not perfect.
I mean, I was just a Harvard
grad last year, all right?
[ Laughs ]
Most of my education
has been what we've been doing
this last year.
You guys are the ones
who know the stuff.
This is why we're here.
We're bringing to the table
what we've done so far.
Listen, I think
what you've done is great,
and I also would say
that many of us
love to invest
in people that have served,
because the military provides
a certain discipline
that applies well
to business.
My problem with you
is I don't think
you're worth $5 million.
When I asked you how much money
you were gonna make
on the $750,000,
the answer was zero.
A multiple of zero
is still zero,
so I can't value it
that way.
So I have to ask myself,
"What have you built,
to date,
that's worth 5 million bucks?"
I don't see that.
A lot of what
we've built to date
has been in the infrastructure
in Afghanistan.
We're gonna hit profitability
in the next month,
and that's when you're gonna see
our margins grow.
We run a high?margin business,
guys, and it's growing.
No,
you're not, apparently.
Yes, we are.
You said
you were gonna make 5%.
Well,
that was my guess, right?
Just because based
on other food and beverage ??
You're a Harvard grad.
You don't have a gut.
You have
a business model.
Our gross margins online are,
what ?? 75% or 80%.
So how isn't that translating
into 20%, pre?tax?
That's what I
don't understand.
Okay.
So I will take that back ??
I don't ??
You know where you lost me,
if you want to be honest?
I loved your story,
but when you told me
you thought you were
gonna make 5%,
I knew you knew nothing
about your numbers. Nothing.
Well, at this point,
what do entrepreneurs focus on?
They focus on gross margin,
and they focus on top line.
I'm not focused on cutting
my costs or overhead costs,
because if I was ??
You must have a plan.
36 months from now,
aren't you gonna try and make
$5 million in sales?
You're not focused on cutting
you costs or overhead costs?
At the moment, we're not.
I'm focused on gross margins,
as you guys
probably should be also at,
what ?? year one?
You got ??
When you come in,
you're not in Afghanistan.
You're in
the Shark Tank now.
You have to know
your numbers.
They do know
their numbers.
No, they don't.
They don't know
what their business model is.
Let me tell you, Mr. Wonderful,
once we hit profitability,
we're ??
I'm sorry, guys.
I'm sorry.
You had me at the beginning,
but the minute I sensed
you didn't know your numbers,
I'm out,
and I am out.
Okay, guys,
I think your mission is good.
I think it's gonna be impactful
beyond just your product.
I've invested a lot
in military?based companies.
You know, Combat Flip Flops
does a lot in Afghanistan.
So, um, I'm gonna offer you
the $250K for 15%,
and that's non?negotiable.
Don't even think
about a counter,
'cause this is the number
or not.
Herjavec: Kim,
I'll make it really easy.
My offer was gonna be
$250,000 for 25%,
'cause I think ?? I think you're
right on the starting point.
Mark's offer is better.
I'm not gonna compete on that.
I'm out.
What're you gonna do?
Mark, we'd like
to accept your offer.
That's what I'm
talkin' about!
[ Chuckles ]
Whoo!
Whoo!
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.
Congratulations, guys.
Thanks, Mark.
You guys are doing
great stuff.
Thanks, Mark.
All right,
guys, thanks so much.
Thanks, Mark.
Thank you, Sharks.
It was really nice
to meet you.
O'Leary: Thank you.
Take care.
Greiner: Congratulations.
Thank you.
Cuban: Thanks, guys.
Miller: Striking a deal with
Mark Cuban is a game?changer
for the women in Afghanistan
who work for us,
for the farmers
in Afghanistan.
Now we're gonna have
the ability to scale
and bring our brand
to all the consumers in America.
I mean,
this is ?? this is huge.
This is huge for us.
Cuban: It'll be good.
I'm expanding
my Afghani operations.
