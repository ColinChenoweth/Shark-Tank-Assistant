Hi, Sharks.

My company is Peoples Design.
Peoples Design
is a company dedicated
to positive innovation.
Today, I'm here to show you
the Scooping Bowl.
The Scooping Bowl will become
your go?to kitchen gadget.
Peoples:
You guys are loving this.
Hold on. There's more.
All right, guys,
look at this.
Thank you very much, Tyler.
I'm gonna give one to Lori.
Thank you.
There you go, Lori.
O'Leary:
Thank you very much.
It's very cool.
I get blue.
John: Thank you.
Cuban: Thank you.
Tell us about you.
I'll tell you about me.
It's ??
It's an unlikely story, guys.
When I was born,
the doctors told my mom,
"It's unlikely he's gonna
survive more than two weeks..."
Oh, wow.
Wow.
Herjavec: So, Tyler...
Good for you, Tyler.
Tyler, where are you
in the product cycle?
Mm?hmm.
Is this a prototype?
This is not a prototype.
Well, listen, Tyler, I'm gonna
take a flier on you.
I like you.
I think this is smart.
It's a better mouse trap.
Cooks will respond to it.
It's a great gadget
to have in the kitchen.
So I'm gonna make you
an offer ??
$75,000 for 33 1/3% ??
so that I will have
and Tyler has an offer
from Lori for his
multi?use bowl company,
Peoples Design.
I think I can help you
get this everywhere.
But you need
to say yes now.
Cuban: Well, I'll simplify it
real quick, right?
My favorite utensil
in the kitchen is the phone
so I can call Campisi's to get
salad delivery, so I'm out.
Yeah, I'm out.
John: To me, there's too many
gadgets out there, honestly.
Tyler,
it's a good deal.
I wouldn't wait.
Lori, would you consider
a royalty?
Ooh.
Greiner: A royalty?
What?!
A royalty.
Okay. Tell me what ??
I'm curious.
What kind of royalty
are you thinking?
[ Sighs ]
How much per bowl?
$1 per bowl.
Mm.
I know it's
a valuable product.
I know people will buy it
when they see it.
Yes or no, Tyler?
Um, Sharks,
I want to let you know
I'm gonna take this deal.
Yay!
[ Chuckles ]
Cuban: Smart.
Good.
I'm glad.
Not quite the fastest deal,
but...
Well, I know
it wasn't the fastest...
But good for you.
No, that's good for you, Tyler.
Well done.
Did a great job.
Thank you.
Well done, Tyler.
Thanks, Tyler.
Peoples: Striking a deal with
Lori means I can make an impact.
If you follow your dreams,
it is possible to achieve them.
My family's gonna
be very proud of me.
