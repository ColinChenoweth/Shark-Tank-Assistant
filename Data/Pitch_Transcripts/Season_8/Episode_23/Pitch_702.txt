Peoples:
We're gonna catch Mommy!
My name is Tyler Peoples.
I live with my wife, Cassie,
and my son, Josiah,
in Colorado Springs,
Colorado.
When I was born,
my mother suffered a stroke.
The doctors told her
that it was unlikely
that I was going to survive.
That left me deaf
until the age of 3.
But I've overcome
all of that now.
Growing up, my great?grandma
taught me how to cook.
I got my first job as a grill
cook when I was a teenager.
I worked my way up
until I was the executive chef
at one of the best restaurants
in town, and I loved it.
But I just felt a calling
to feed people
who were truly hungry, so I left
the fancy restaurant life,
and I went to work at
the Springs Rescue Mission,
a homeless shelter
in our community.
Before they come in,
I want to make sure
we have nice hot coffee
ready to go.
After all those hours
in the kitchen,
I knew there was a product
I wished I had,
so I took the risk
and did it myself.
I've overcome a lot,
even at a young age,
and I think that's what's helped
me not be afraid to fail.
I know my product will become
a go?to kitchen gadget.
And with the help of a Shark,
this could be huge.
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Tyler Peoples.
My company is Peoples Design.
I come from Colorado Springs,
and I'm asking $75,000
for a 25%
stake in my company.
Peoples Design
is a company dedicated
to positive innovation.
Today, I'm here to show you
the Scooping Bowl.
The Scooping Bowl will become
your go?to kitchen gadget.
Its unique and innovative design
will have you wondering,
"Why didn't I think of that?"
Sharks, this is what
we have right now.
A bowl for your salsa,
a bowl for your chips,
a bowl to mix your batter,
a rubber spatula,
a colander,
an egg separator.
Sharks, this is a mess.
You're doing dishes all night.
I know what you're thinking,
Sharks.
There's got to be a better way.
There is.
All right, Sharks,
this is the Scooping Bowl.
The Scooping Bowl will save you
time, space, and money.
Let me show you
how it works, guys.
We all love healthy
and delicious snacks.
Take your favorite fruits and
vegetables, pop them in here.
The blade holds the food back.
We're soaking, we're washing,
and we're straining, guys.
Same bowl washes,
strains, soaks.
[ Laughing ]
Wow.
Look at that.
That's amazing!
I like this boy.
Peoples:
You guys are loving this.
Hold on. There's more.
All right, guys,
look at this.
The silicone blade
cleans it, nice and dry.
Guess what, guys. I mentioned
an egg separator earlier.
Let me show you
how that works.
Instead of breaking out
two bowls,
getting your hands dirty,
guys, check this out.
The yolk stays back,
and the white slips through.
Let's see.
Can you guys see that?
Wow.
Wow.
Let's make our favorite recipes,
right?
This is perfect for pancakes,
waffles, brownies,
cookies, birthday cake.
In one smooth motion,
the Scooping Bowl is gonna get
all of your expensive
ingredients right out.
Ahh.
Sharks, once you feel this
in your hands,
you're gonna get it,
and you're gonna love it.
I have one
for each of you.
Thank you.
[ Laughs ]
Wow.
Thank you very much, Tyler.
I'm gonna give one to Lori.
Thank you.
There you go, Lori.
O'Leary:
Thank you very much.
It's very cool.
I get blue.
John: Thank you.
Cuban: Thank you.
Tell us about you.
I'll tell you about me.
It's ??
It's an unlikely story, guys.
When I was born,
the doctors told my mom,
"It's unlikely he's gonna
survive more than two weeks..."
Oh, wow.
Wow.
"...and if he does survive,
it's unlikely
he will ever gain his hearing,
and it's unlikely
that he will ever speak."
It's unlikely that a guy
with no culinary training,
the son of a housekeeper,
would become the head chef
at the best restaurant
in town.
It's unlikely that a guy
with no business training
would get a U. S. patent,
would find a manufacturer.
It's unlikely, guys,
but it's true.
And I want to invite you guys
to join this unlikely story.
All right,
tell us your story.
I worked at all sorts
of fancy restaurants,
and I cooked for thousands
of people, fine dining.
So I worked my way up.
I was the head chef
at a great restaurant in town.
And you know what?
I had in my heart
to do more,
so I left my job,
and I went to work
at the local rescue mission.
So, what happened?
How did you think of this?
I deal with bowls,
I deal with spatulas,
I deal with all this stuff
many, many times a day.
I struggle, it's annoying,
it's a mess, and I'm thinking,
"There's got to be a better
way," and I'm waiting
for somebody else
to make this dream real.
And I was tired of waiting.
Guys, I knew that if it was
gonna happen,
I was gonna make it happen.
Herjavec: So, Tyler...
Good for you, Tyler.
Tyler, where are you
in the product cycle?
Mm?hmm.
Is this a prototype?
This is not a prototype.
I found a manufacturer,
and I have a utility patent.
What does it cost you to make,
and what do you sell it for?
It costs $5.80.
I sell it for $24.95.
And have you sold
any of them?
That's a great question.
Yes, I have sold.
How many?
[ Laughs ]
I've sold 200.
So, I know that's not
a great number.
Well, how have you done it?
Online?
I've done it trade shows
and gadget expos.
This, I believe, sells best
when people see it.
'Cause in a store, you wouldn't
know what this does.
Right.
Why would you leave
a great restaurant
to go work
at a mission?
Mm?hmm.
Is there a personal ??
He has a higher goal.
He has a higher goal.
I always knew I wanted to feed
people who were hungry
and not just for food
but for opportunity.
And I don't know how many
thousands of people I've fed.
They weren't hungry.
They weren't.
Greiner: Are you able
to live on that, though?
What's helping you
to pay your rent?
I am.
At that shelter,
we serve over 150,000 meals
to the public,
so that's free of charge.
But it has a cost.
So, one way
to recoup the money
is we run a catering business,
and the catering business
employs men who have graduated
our addiction?recovery program.
And I help
to fund the mission.
Good for you.
Wow.
Thank you.
Greiner:
Good for you.
Well, listen, Tyler, I'm gonna
take a flier on you.
I like you.
I think this is smart.
It's a better mouse trap.
Cooks will respond to it.
It's a great gadget
to have in the kitchen.
So I'm gonna make you
an offer ??
$75,000 for 33 1/3% ??
so that I will have
a third of the business
and you will have the rest,
and I will help you get this out
there into Bed Bath,
QVC, and all of that.
I think I can help you
get this everywhere.
But you need
to say yes now.
Narrator: All Sharks
are still in,
and Tyler has an offer
from Lori for his
multi?use bowl company,
Peoples Design.
I think I can help you
get this everywhere.
But you need
to say yes now.
Cuban: Well, I'll simplify it
real quick, right?
My favorite utensil
in the kitchen is the phone
so I can call Campisi's to get
salad delivery, so I'm out.
Yeah, I'm out.
John: To me, there's too many
gadgets out there, honestly.
I?I think people will buy it,
and they'll never use it,
even though it does work,
so I'm out.
All right, Kevin.
[ Chuckles ]
Um...
If ?? If you don't take
that deal...
Yeah.
[ Laughing ]
O'Leary:
... right now...
Tyler,
it's a good deal.
I wouldn't wait.
Lori, would you consider
a royalty?
Ooh.
Greiner: A royalty?
What?!
A royalty.
Okay. Tell me what ??
I'm curious.
What kind of royalty
are you thinking?
[ Sighs ]
How much per bowl?
$1 per bowl.
Mm.
I know it's
a valuable product.
I know people will buy it
when they see it.
And I know that a partnership
with you is priceless.
Here's what scares me.
'Cause, you know,
I've done over 500 products.
I know that when I first
started,
I'd go into JCPenney,
they gave me a chance,
and I would demonstrate
my earring organizer,
and I would sell
a hundred a day.
You've sold only 200
in all the trade shows
you've done so far.
Mm?hmm.
So I'm taking a risk.
The reason why I want the third
is because I know the work
and the effort
that I'm gonna put in.
Okay.
I'm gonna get it
on QVC.
I have a built?in audience
that trusts me and knows me.
But this is gonna take
a lot of work by my team
and myself to get this out there
into kitchen stores,
Bed Bath &amp; Beyond,
all the places that it can be.
I'm just asking for 8% more
than what you offered,
but here's the thing.
You should answer me
right now.
I know my value.
Just as a reminder,
I make millionaires.
That's what I do.
My offer was $75,000
for 33 1/3%.
Yes or no, Tyler?
Um, Sharks,
I want to let you know
I'm gonna take this deal.
Yay!
[ Chuckles ]
Cuban: Smart.
Good.
I'm glad.
Not quite the fastest deal,
but...
Well, I know
it wasn't the fastest...
But good for you.
No, that's good for you, Tyler.
Well done.
Did a great job.
Thank you.
Well done, Tyler.
Thanks, Tyler.
Peoples: Striking a deal with
Lori means I can make an impact.
If you follow your dreams,
it is possible to achieve them.
My family's gonna
be very proud of me.
They've always believed in me,
and they ??
they're gonna be proud.
