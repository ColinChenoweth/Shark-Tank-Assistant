?Hey, I'm Harriet Mills.
?And I'm Patrick Mills.
We're from Raleigh,
North Carolina,
and we're
the husband?and?wife duo
behind Wine &amp; Design.
Today,
we're seeking $500,000
for 10% equity
in our company.
Wine &amp; Design
are art studios
where the instructor teaches you
step?by?step painting tips
while you might get
a little bit tipsy.
Each session is
like a happy hour,
with music
and a party atmosphere.
There's nothing
more enjoyable
than a night of art class
with drinks, food, and friends.
Now, Sharks,
who's ready to get
their art buzz on
with us?
?We are.
?Yeah.
?Yes, great.
?Whoo?hoo!
Bring on the wine.
Harriet: Are you ladies having
a good time
at your bachelorette night?
[ Laughs ] Uh, yeah.
We're in shock.
It's everything
I ever dreamed about ??
I swear to God.
When you're done
with the yellow,
we're gonna wash off
our brush.
Can you believe this?
No.
So go ahead
and dip your paintbrush
in the pink.
If you are at that step,
you're gonna
follow my lead.
We're just gonna
add some beautiful pink
on these pecs.
The last step is the blue.
I want you to wash off
your brush, dab it a little bit.
We're going to go over
all the stencil marks,
so you're gonna kind of
draw a line here, here.
Pretty much all of these pecs,
these abs.
[ Laughing ] Are you doing
anything right over there?
It's a friggin'
masterpiece!
I'm telling you!
The last step is black,
and we are going to paint
the background of our canvas.
Once you are complete,
let me know,
and we will brag about
our final product.
I'm ready.
I'm done.
All right.
Ready?
Here it comes.
Wait, let's do it all
at the same time.
On the count of 3.
1, 2, 3...
[ Cheering ]
?All right.
?Look at Barb's!
You've done a great job.
You should be super?proud
of yourselves.
So, I'm gonna
take my friend Richard.
?Bye, Richard.
?Bye.
Thank you. Thank you, ladies,
for your bachelorette party.
And thank you, guys,
for joining us.
Corcoran:
Oh, my God. [ Sighs ]
I hope y'all had a good time.
I know it's a lot.
Thank you, Richard.
This has been the best pitch
on "Shark Tank."
Oh, yes!
Bar none.
Very glad.
Yeah, can we find out
about the business,
how you guys
came up with it?
?Yeah.
?Give us the background.
Okay, so, six years ago,
me and a girlfriend went to
Charleston, South Carolina,
and went to
a similar concept,
with two bottles of wine,
and we had the best time.
I was like, "I can do this,
and I can do it better."
Within 60 days,
Wine &amp; Design was born.
Patrick: So, this is a way
for people
to put down
their cellphones,
get away for two hours,
paint a painting for $35.
That's the cost?
$35?
$35.
Per person?
Yes.
So, we have 74 locations,
franchising.
?74?
?Nationwide?
74.
In how much time?
Um, well...
Five years.
Yeah, five years.
Five years. Wow.
So, six years ago,
I started this business.
Good for you.
Thank you.
And so, how long
were you independent
before the first franchise?
About nine months.
And what were your sales
in that nine months?
Patrick: $250,000.
Wow!
How do you get your payment?
So, we take 6% royalties
off the gross revenue.
Like this year,
we will do around $10 million
in gross revenue...
Sharks: Wow.
...of all the locations,
so we'll bring in around
$600,000 cash in royalties.
Right now, our franchise fee
is at $25,000.
Oh!
So...
This is a dream business.
So we'll generate
around $200,000,
$250,000 off of that.
How many, um, territories
have you sold?
Or has it all been
one?offs?
Right now,
we're in 14 states.
So far, I'm impressed,
okay?
Okay.
What is the 6% going to be
next year?
Next year,
we'll probably do anywhere
from $12 million
to $13 million in sales.
We will easily make,
I'd say,
right at $350,000
to $400,000 in profit.
We've done over $24 million
in gross revenue...
Wow.
... from all the stores.
What?!
We've never had
somebody on the show
that's franchised
a business
to the scale
that you have ??
ever.
8 seasons.
Right.
Oh, and I will tell you
all of our franchisees
are women?owned.
You know, 'cause this
is secondary income.
When I created
this business,
I really wanted
a flexible schedule with my son.
Guys, congratulations,
right?
What you've accomplished
is great.
Thank you.
But at the same time,
at 74 franchisees,
$300,000, $400,000 profits,
if you grow 10 times,
you're still not
up to making enough money
to return me my money.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Think about this problem
for a second.
Let's say I did your deal.
I give you
half a million dollars,
I get 10% of the company.
It takes me 16.6 years
to get my money back,
which is why
this is mis?priced.
You know,
he's got a great point.
Yeah.
Like, the only way
this would make sense
for an investor
is if somebody bought
the whole company.
How much you willing to sell
the whole thing for,
just out of interest?
Eh, make us an offer.
Greiner: Why would you want to?
Oh, my God.
Why would you do that?
Everything's for sale.
Everything's for sale,
right?
Let's make an offer
and see.
You've got a pretty good
foothold in this.
Why would you want
to get out?
Well,
I personally think
that we're growing a little
too slow at this point
because, you know,
we do have competition,
and our competition
has a lot of studios.
We're the third?largest
in the country right now.
Do you feel like
you're losing ground
or gaining ground on them?
I, per??
I think we're ??
I think we're kind of
staying at that third,
and we're not
getting higher.
I see. There's a lot
of competition out there.
Your valuation
is way off the charts.
I'm out.
Listen, very impressive.
I know people love this.
So, you have 74 franchises.
You have competition.
You're number 3.
And when something's
really crowded like that,
I get concerned
about how far it can grow.
I'm out.
Herjavec:
All right, where are we at?
Kevin, did you make
an offer?
O'Leary:
The only way this works is,
I give you $150,000
for the 10% equity.
That means I get
my money back
in between
three and four years,
which is about as long
as I want to wait.
And I'll loan you $350,000
as a line of credit at 12%.
It's 1% a month.
You draw it down as you need it.
That makes sense to me.
That's a decent return,
and I'm not stuck forever.
Hmm.
So back to loan shark.
Well, I think if you have
a better structure, Robert,
you should ??
Well, I do have
a better structure, actually.
Harriet and Patrick have one
offer on the table, from Kevin,
for their art?class company
Wine &amp; Design.
But Robert
also seems interested.
Well, I think if you have
a better structure, Robert,
you should ??
Well, I do have a better
structure, actually.
?Well, let's hear it, then.
?You do?
I'll make you an offer.
I'll give you
the $500,000,
But I get one?third
of the business.
What a lot of people
don't realize is they think ??
they start a business,
business takes off,
and they just get
to pull that money out.
Whenever you take a dollar
out of the business,
that's income paid
at a very high tax rate.
You've built
a successful business,
but you haven't been able
to pull that money out.
I'll buy one?third of your stock
for $500,000.
Money's yours, but I own
one?third of the business.
?Do you understand it?
?Yes, I do. I got that.
Greiner: It's shocking to me
that you bring a naked man
into the Tank
and you get two offers
from the two male Sharks.
I know!
Exactly.
I was thinking Barbara was gonna
be right there with us.
O'Leary: You know, they're two
very different offers.
What are you
going to do?
Well, let me ask you,
first of all, Kevin.
If we did partner up,
tell me the first thing
you would give
as a suggestion
on our company.
I would turn
my social media cannon on this
and push a tremendous amount
of data out
into the market
about our relationship.
I have
a $10 million wine business.
The first thing
I'm going to do
is figure out a cooperative deal
with you
to make sure the O'Leary Wines
are actually sold
at all these events
so we can co?market.
I think the real goal
is to sign up 100 people.
It's a second income.
That's the story.
Get that out there,
you're gonna have people
signing up all the time.
That's the story,
and that's what my team
can build out there.
O'Leary: It's really about how
much equity you want to sell.
You got to make up your mind.
You're in the Shark Tank.
Now's your moment.
What are you gonna do?
