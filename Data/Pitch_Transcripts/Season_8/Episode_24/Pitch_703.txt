Harriet: Are you ladies having
a good time
at your bachelorette night?
[ Laughs ] Uh, yeah.
We're in shock.
It's everything
I ever dreamed about ??
I swear to God.
When you're done
with the yellow,
we're gonna wash off
our brush.
Can you believe this?
No.
Patrick: So, this is a way
for people
to put down
their cellphones,
get away for two hours,
paint a painting for $35.
That's the cost?
$35?
$35.
Per person?
Yes.
So, we have 74 locations,
franchising.
?74?
?Nationwide?
74.
In how much time?
Um, well...
Five years.
Yeah, five years.
Five years. Wow.
So, six years ago,
I started this business.
Good for you.
Thank you.
Patrick: $250,000.
Wow!
How do you get your payment?
So, we take 6% royalties
off the gross revenue.
Like this year,
we will do around $10 million
in gross revenue...
Sharks: Wow.
...of all the locations,
so we'll bring in around
$600,000 cash in royalties.
Right now, our franchise fee
is at $25,000.
Oh!
So...
This is a dream business.
So we'll generate
around $200,000,
$250,000 off of that.
How many, um, territories
have you sold?
Or has it all been
one?offs?
Right now,
we're in 14 states.
So far, I'm impressed,
okay?
Okay.
What is the 6% going to be
next year?
Next year,
we'll probably do anywhere
from $12 million
to $13 million in sales.
We will easily make,
I'd say,
right at $350,000
to $400,000 in profit.
We've done over $24 million
in gross revenue...
Wow.
... from all the stores.
What?!
We've never had
somebody on the show
that's franchised
a business
to the scale
that you have ??
ever.
8 seasons.
Right.
