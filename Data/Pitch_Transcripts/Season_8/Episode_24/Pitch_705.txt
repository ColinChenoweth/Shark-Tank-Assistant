I'm Joe.
And I'm Jake.
Our company is Rocketbook,
and we're seeking
$400,000 for 10%.
And we make...
Both:
Notebooks from the future.
[ Laughter ]
It doesn't matter whether
you're a student or a Shark.
We just can't let go
of pen and paper.
It's our most natural
form of expression.
But meanwhile, the rest
of our lives are digital
and accessible
across any device.
That's why
we created Rocketbook.
It's really just
a pen?and?paper notebook,
but take notes
in your Rocketbook
and scan them
with the Rocketbook app
to instantly blast those notes
to popular cloud services
instantly organized
for you.
At the bottom
of each Rocketbook page
are seven symbols.
And you decide
what they do.
So, Mark, maybe use
that diamond symbol
so that those notes
go to your startup pitch folder
inside of Google Docs.
Maybe, Lori, how about
you use the star symbol
so when you mark that,
those notes go ?? Zhoo! ??
right to
your assistant's e?mail.
Now that your notes
are safe
in all your favorite
cloud services,
you really don't need
this hard copy anymore,
which is why we designed
our first notebook,
the Rocketbook Wave,
to be reusable.
That's right.
You can make your entire
notebook contents disappear.
For this,
I'm gonna need an assistant.
Uh, Robert, if you will?
Oh.
Please don't
make me disappear.
[ Laughs ]
Your pen.
Thank you.
And if you will,
just choose any random page
in your Rocketbook.
Draw some doodle,
maybe your signature ??
whatever you'd like.
Fantastic.
O'Leary:
Beautiful work, Robert.
Okay, Robert,
check this out.
I'm just gonna use the
Rocketbook app to scan this in
so that later,
we can make these notes
reappear.
Oh, that's cool.
Oh, cool.
Mm?hmm.
Okay, for this part,
Sharks,
this does require
a fairly bulky piece of hardware
that we had to bring along
with us ??
The Rocket Reset Chamber.
[ Laughter ]
Greiner: A microwave?
It's from the future.
And, Robert, you're gonna
microwave your notebook here.
And Commander Epstein
is gonna give you
a little mug of water
to place right on the circles
on the cover.
Okay.
Let's close it up.
What, you really have
to put a mug of water on there?
You really do ??
That's an important part
of controlling
the heating process
so it works
in every microwave.
All right, Robert, it's time
to nuke your notebook.
Don't do it, Robert.
No!
Aaah!
Why don't we have a seat?
I'll hand out samples,
and I'll explain
to you the process.
Thank you. Thank you.
The only reason
I'm microwaving this book
is to erase it so I don't
have to buy a new one.
What's the matter
with you guys?
Don't you want to sell
a second book to everybody?
[ Laughter ]
Why would I want
to erase it?
Why wouldn't I want to
make them throw it out
or burn it
and buy another one?
Well ??
Thank goodness
you've met me.
[ Laughter ]
You just solved
your whole problem.
Thank you.
Well, we're doing
pretty well.
We've sold about 75,000
of these so far.
Have you really?!
We have.
What, are you selling
to Martians?
People love it.
It's fun.
Herjavec:
How much do they cost?
They cost $27 retail.
So, your total sales
are what?
Damn! Good for you!
Epstein:
$2.2 million.
How much? How much?
Herjavec: $2.2 million?!
What?!
How much do they sell for?
$2.2 million.
Herjavec: We are taking you
way more seriously now.
Hey, hang on a second.
Yeah.
Did you actually prove
it erased my page?
Let's do it.
Hmm?
?Oh!
?[ Gasps ]
?That's amazing!
?Amazing, Robert!
It's the Rocketbook!
And I just lost a sale...
Cuban: Okay, wait, wait,
wait a second.
...'cause the guy
doesn't have to buy it again.
Um, we're not losing
too many sales.
Why are people buying this?
Because it's awesome.
And, actually ??
[ Laughter ]
No, no!
People come
for the microwaveabilty.
They're attracted to that,
but they stick around
for the Rocket system.
O'Leary: Okay, guys,
any iPad now with a pen
can do this
right to the cloud.
That's true,
but it's another gadget to lose.
It's another battery
to charge.
I get it.
I just ?? I'm just trying
to wrap my head around
nuking the book.
I just ??
Herjavec: I love the gimmick.
It works.
?But ??
?Well, wait.
What makes it work?
Greiner: I have two questions.
Let me ask ?? what's
the science that makes it work?
There's a lot
of engineering
that has gone
into the construction
of a microwave?safe
notebook.
And we have
patents pending.
What does the water
do to it?
The water absorbs a lot
of the microwave energy,
and it slows down
the heating process.
This is the funniest,
wackiest, most ridiculous thing
I've heard in a long time.
It's brilliant.
Thank you.
My fear is,
it's a great gimmick.
And two to three years
from now,
I think people
will get tired of it.
So I'm out.
Guys, I don't get
the schtick.
I mean, I applaud
the sales you've had,
but I'm amazed that you've sold
as much as you have.
And I think you've got other
Sharks that are interested.
I don't see it.
I'm out.
Thank you for that.
Guys, I don't ??
This is so crazy ??
so crazy that you can get
millions in sales
by nuking a notebook
in a microwave.
I'm not even sure I'm
on the planet Earth right now.
There's nobody in the world
that would take paper
and erase it
when I could sell
another one.
In my universe,
that's a dark force,
an evil force
I can't understand.
I'm out.
I have to say ??
I never, ever would dream
that anybody could reinvent
a binder, a paper binder.
I mean, like, you just ??
A notebook is a notebook.
That, by the way, you can buy
in any Staples for a buck?20.
A $1.20 book is now $27
'cause you can stick it
in a frickin' microwave!
That's why
I'm so disturbed.
I don't think the price
is bad for what it is.
You've proven the concept,
but I don't like all the steps.
I don't like
that I actually have to
take a picture
of each page,
and then, you know,
when I'm done,
I have to microwave it,
put the water on it,
and all of that.
[ Laughs ]
I get how people
might like it,
you know, one time,
tell their friends,
this or that,
but then after a while,
I think it fizzles.
So for that reason,
I'm out.
Well, Mark's still in.
Guys [Laughs]
just the microwave ??
isn't that what sells it ??
period, end of story?
Lemay:
No, absolutely not.
That is a differentiator,
but people are buying these
and repurchasing them
because of
the Rocket System.
Where do you see yourselves
in five years?
Well, I think we're gonna
build this into a major brand,
just like people thought,
"What could a Post?it note be?"
Well, now it takes up
all of Staples.
We're gonna be like
the operating system for paper.
Greiner: But a Post?it note ??
all you have to do is
you write
and you stick it on something.
Operating system
for paper.
We're gonna have
digitally enabled paper
and office products.
[ Laughs ]
Guys, I mean...
I'm out.
I'm out.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
Thank you.
?Congrats.
?Unbelievable.
?Thank you.
?Bye, guys.
Oh, my God.
Lemay: Of course we would've
loved to work with the Sharks
and secured a deal
with them,
but it's not always a fit,
and that's quite all right.
We're having
a great time,
and, you know,
it's onward and upward for us.
