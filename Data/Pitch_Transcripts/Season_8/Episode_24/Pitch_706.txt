Our lovely instructor,
Heather,
is gonna be teaching you
a portrait painting today.
?Oh.
?We have a little bit of help
with our figure model,
Richard.
Come on out, Richard!
[ Laughter ]
Wow.
Getting good now.
One of our most popular classes
is our bachelorette package.
[ Funky music plays ]
?Oh, my God!
?Aah!
What?!
[ Laughter ]
?Just for you, Barbara.
?Just for you, Barbara.
And today ??
tonight, we're actually
gonna be having
a bachelorette party
for Lori and Barbara!
?Whoo!
?Oh, my gosh!
I don't believe it.
It is time to get
this party started.
If y'all could get
y'all's apron on,
get ready
to start painting.
Seriously?
We're gonna get
the party started.
?It's perfect, Mark.
?All of us are painting?
?All of us our painting.
?Oh, my God.
Do you need help
with that?
I need help
with everything.
I'm shaking.
I know.
I'm shaking.
Okay.
I think everyone
might need to take a sip of wine
before we begin.
?Oh, yeah.
Does Richard come with
every party?
Cheers, Kevin.
Heather: I'm gonna go ahead
and get y'all started.
Everyone has
their apron on.
We've got our boas on.
Barb, I've never
seen you speechless.
My name is Heather.
Ladies, thank you for having me.
We don't care
who you are, Heather.
To you, dear.
[ Laughter ]
So, you ready?
First thing you're gonna do
is you're gonna take
your large square brush.
We are putting water
all over our canvas,
just like I'm doing here.
And then you're gonna grab
your small brush.
And then I'm gonna dip it
in the yellow.
You'll just follow my lead,
okay?
Look at our beautiful Richard
for inspiration.
We're just gonna add yellow
in a few parts that we want to,
so just jump
right into the canvas.
My name is Heather, and I live
in the Poconos, Pennsylvania,
with my two daughters,
Casey and Sarah.
Ooh!
Oh, that's beautiful.
I've been working
in the bridal industry
for 11 years.
I love working with brides
because it's a happy day
in their lives.
They're glowing.
They're excited.
And I'm excited
to work with them.
I came up with my product
after watching brides
try on their gowns
and realizing
there was a problem
that needed to be solved.
So, what are you guys
gonna paint?
I had to put the product idea
on the side for about a decade
because I wanted
to start a family.
And nobody believed in the idea
as much as I did.
I'm divorced now,
but I never stopped thinking
about my product idea.
And although I didn't have
as much encouragement
as I would have liked back then,
I have a lot of it now.
All we need is
those little strings on the top,
and it would be perfect.
I put in $40,000
of my retirement money
in this product.
That wasn't easy,
but I'm glad that I did it.
I found the confidence in myself
to help my business
go all the way.
With a Shark behind me,
we will be unstoppable.
Hi.
My name is Heather.
I'm from the Poconos,
Pennsylvania,
and I'm the inventor
of the Bridal Buddy.
I'm seeking $75,000
for 10% equity in my company.
[ Wedding march plays ]
Weddings are a magical time
for brides,
a day every girl dreams about.
But there's
a not?so?glamorous side.
Imagine ??
you said your vows.
You're at your reception.
You're eating, drinking,
dancing,
having a great time
in your gorgeous gown.
And all of a sudden,
it hits you.
I have to pee!
What do you do?
[ Laughter ]
You could recruit
the help of your bridesmaids,
who are off at the bar
two sangrias deep
with the groomsmen,
to help fluff your gown.
What do you do?
Sharks,
in comes my invention ??
the Bridal Buddy.
It's a sheer, lightweight slip
worn under the gown
that helps you bag up
your dress...
Oh, my...
...so that you can use
the bathroom on your own.
[ Laughs ]
You simply bag up
your gown.
[ Laughter ]
Wow!
Arms through the holes.
you'll notice them
as your "something blue."
?Come on!
?Wow!
That is crazy.
[ Laughs ]
Then you simply adjust
your drawstring.
And voilà.
Oh, my...
And go.
[ Laughter ]
And as you can see ??
Well, we need the sigh.
We need the sigh of relief.
[ Sighs ]
Thank you.
[ Laughter ]
And as you can see,
it bags up her gown,
and so she can use
the bathroom on her own,
and it protects the gown
in the bathroom stall.
Wow.
And when
you're finished...
You just walk out
like that.
...simply undo your gown,
unfurl it,
and you're ready
to party.
Stenlake: Use the bathroom
on their own with dignity,
one Bridal Buddy at a time.
Thank you.
Marissa, would you mind
handing out samples for them?
We have samples?
I was thinking maybe
you could try it on.
Thank you.
Here you go, Lori.
Thank you.
Corcoran: Pretty packaging.
O'Leary:
Normally, you would take
one of your bridesmaids
into the washroom with you,
where she would assist you,
which is the long?term tradition
of the bridesmaid ??
to be the maid of the bride,
to assist her
in her toilet duties.
[ Laughter ]
You can't listen to him.
Is that why bridesmaids
were first invented?
?Exactly. It is.
?That's exactly ??
I am Mr. Wonderful.
I'm the king
of love and weddings,
so I know this.
Heather, how did you come up
with this great idea?
Well, I started working
in the bridal industry
in 1998.
I did all sorts of jobs
in the bridal industry.
But the one question
they would always ask is,
"How do I go to the bathroom
in this thing?"
Wow.
And they say,
"Oh, you can take your girls
in with you.
You can wear
a garbage bag."
That was another thing.
I'm like, "No, no, no, no, no."
A garbage bag?
Garbage bag?
Yes, a garbage bag.
That would be
disgustingly hot and sticky.
Who wants to wear that
under your beautiful gown?
So what I did was,
in around 2002,
I came up
with a prototype.
And I was expecting
my children,
and I had to put it aside.
So I was a stay?at?home mom
for a few years.
And then I went, finally, to
live on my own with my children.
And in the house,
I found the bag that I had kept
of all my notes
and all my materials,
and it just hit me ??
I'm like, "It's time."
It is time.
So I came up with a
better version of the original.
What year did you
start it again?
Um, it was...2015.
You created it
in 2002,
but you only launched
in 2015.
Yeah.
What happened
in that 13 years
that you didn't move forward
with it?
Um...you know,
life happens.
Without going into
too much detail,
all I'll say is this.
[ Sighs ]
You know,
surround yourself
with positive,
encouraging people
because that is the way
you get ahead.
And I have found that out
the hard way.
Unfortunately, it took me
many years to figure that out.
What made the change?
Because
I believed in myself.
And I kept working on it
and working on it
and trying to get
the best possible version of it.
And here I am,
and I'm proof
that you can overcome
any obstacle
and get
where you want to be.
Focus on the future.
I am done with the past,
but it is
a learning experience for me.
They always say
look back to learn,
look forward to succeed.
You're exactly right.
Do you have any sales,
or are you
still in development?
We are up to $195,000
in sales.
Wow.
And what does one cost?
One costs $29.95.
What does it cost you
to make it?
$14 apiece.
Even at low volumes
at a $14 cost,
this product could easily
support a $39.95 price point.
I started at $59.95.
Yes!
Now you're talking.
What happened, though?
Then what happened?
And that was great.
And I've had brides tell me
it's way too expensive.
No!
It's too much.
It's like, no,
why would you ??
Did your sales
start flatlining?
It did. After a little while,
it started to go down.
Heather, who's the biggest
retailer for wedding?
I forget their name
right now.
David's Bridal?
Yeah. Have you
ever approached them?
I have.
And what did they say?
Their response was,
is it doesn't
go with their merchandise.
But it's a very needed thing.
They don't like
the potty association?
Exactly.
Cuban: Heather, let me kind of
clear things up a little bit.
Congratulations to you
for overcoming your obstacles
and chasing your dreams.
I think you're gonna be
very successful.
But the wedding industry is
not something I want to pursue,
so I'm out.
Thank you, Mark.
You're welcome.
$195,000 for a $29 item ??
that's great.
I mean, you're ?? you're ??
you're going somewhere.
I think the price point
is too low.
I think that...
I would agree.
...it's gonna be
very difficult to sell it
one at a time online,
unless you can make
that retail association,
'cause most brides would buy it
at the point of purchase.
For that reason, I'm out.
Okay.
I would like to say something
on Heather's behalf.
Heather is
an incredible human being.
When she approached me
about this,
I was already working
two jobs.
And the idea
of tronking around on Sundays
at bridal shows
for eight hours
in a cold auditorium
was not all that appealing.
But you know what?
I got up here,
and I showed my underpants
to the international community
because I believe
in Heather.
And sometimes
when you love somebody,
it means you show everybody
your underpants.
She is brilliant.
[ Laughter ]
And I'm telling you
right now ??
the way that brides
respond to this product,
I think some of y'all
are making a mistake.
They freak out.
I had one lady tell me
she had to army?crawl
under her friend's wedding dress
and tear her Spanx apart
with her bare hands.
This is a product
that almost every single bride
is going to want.
Marissa,
you're a great salesperson.
Do you have a piece
of the company?
I'm the saleslady.
She's the inventor,
I'm the flasher.
Herjavec:
Marissa, first of all,
that is the best speech
we've ever had on here.
Heather is
an inspiration.
She clawed her way here.
That's a very ??
Hang on, hang on.
You are extremely loyal
and very good friend.
After having heard that ??
And when I first started,
there were several people
that were people
that I knew
that just weren't
believers.
And, you know,
what that did for me
is it made a fire inside of me
to prove them wrong.
And that's
what I see from you.
They actually did you
a favor
because they made you
stronger.
So, what are you missing,
do you feel?
I need connections.
I need help to get
into those ??
for the companies
to listen to me.
I have an offer for you.
I think I can help you
with the manufacturing of it.
I think I could get
your costs <i>way</i> down
so that you get it into retail
at a reasonable price.
Mr. Wonderful
has a platform ??
Honeyfund
and all the other things.
So we have discussed
going in together
to give you an offer.
We are thinking,
what if you bring her in?
So ??
I have to see her
in the deal.
I have to see her
as part of the deal.
He wants to see her in
because you're by yourself.
Right.
So you handle
whatever parts of the business
that we're not
talking about here
that you know
are important.
Still got to hit the shows
with Marissa.
You still got to go ??
And you handle
the rest of the sales,
and you help her.
And we'd all be equal
partners ?? 25, 25, 25, 25.
If we get
all the great purchase orders,
we'll help you fund
those purchase orders,
specifically
for purchase orders.
So you're taking
50% of her business.
Yes.
Yes, it's gonna need that.
Herjavec: Well, hang on.
But I'm gonna take over
manufacturing.
You're taking
<i>75%</i> of the business,
because your condition
is she has to give up ??
Marissa has to be
part of it.
Well, how nice.
They're giving you a tip.
If you want her ??
I forbid you!
have presented a unique offer
to Heather
for her bridal?accessory
company, Bridal Buddy.
You're taking
<i>75%</i> of the business,
because your condition
is that she has to give ??
Marissa has to be part of it.
She has to be.
Well, how nice.
They're giving you a tip,
If you want her ??
I forbid you!
If you want her
to be part of it.
Well, hang on. Your offer
is $75,000 for 75%.
50%.
Well, no.
Let's be real.
No.
Because
she has to give up ??
He wants her to have that.
Let's do it
a different way, Heather.
Heather goes from owning
100% to 25%.
Period, end of story.
Erase that.
She's working
for <i>you,</i> then.
I have an offer.
We can't bring her in
like that.
Let them figure this out.
Excuse me.
You guys ??
You guys discuss
that very complicated thing.
We're starting over.
I have
a very simple offer.
When you told me
that it took 10?plus years
to get going,
I'm telling in my head,
I was out right away.
I'm thinking,
"How does it take 10 years?"
But you know
what I've learned?
I've learned as long
as you get back up there,
who the heck cares
when it is?
But you stand and you get
counted for yourself.
And I'm proud of that.
And I was also reflecting
back on my boyfriend,
who ran off
and married my secretary,
who gave me
the gift of my life,
when he said, "You'll never
succeed without me."
All right?
So I get you.
You're never going down
again.
All right,
now here's my offer.
I think the only
missing ingredient you have
is salesmanship.
And Marissa is
phenomenal at it.
So here's the offer.
It's $75,000
for 33% of your business.
I'm gonna go back
because I didn't like the offer
that we gave before.
Then why did you offer it?
I want to erase it.
No, don't look back.
Look forward.
Okay,
I'm looking forward.
So, I don't want it
to have to be
that you have to be
a partner.
So if you want to have anything
to do with me with this,
we have to
get rid of that.
That was a good offer.
Here's the deal.
You get two Sharks.
We'll drop down to 40%,
so we have 20% each.
You decide
what to do with Marissa,
but you still have
60% of the company.
You decide what you want.
There's no contingency
that she ha??
You work if you want,
you work if you don't want.
Heather, you have two offers.
Sometimes offers go away.
Stenlake: Absolutely.
Lori, would you be willing
to come down a little bit
in your percentage?
To what?
30%.
Kevin?
Wow. Tough decision,
Heather.
What about Barb's offer?
I like Barbara ??
What about 33 1/3%?
Corcoran:
You know what?
I'll do that deal.
Kevin?
$75,000 for 30%.
I would do the deal
if Kevin will do the deal.
Let me understand this ??
You'll do the deal,
$75,000 for 30%.
We get 15% each.
Okay, done.
