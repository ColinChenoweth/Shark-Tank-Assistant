Hello, Sharks.
My name is Adam Rauch.
I'm Derek Shaw, and we are
the founders of Laid Brand.
Today, we are respectfully
and humbly
offering 30% of our business
for $30,000.
Laid Brand helps you get noticed
for all the right reasons ??
with pheromones.
Whether you're trying
to attract a mate
or get that extra boost
of confidence,
pheromones can help you
achieve those desires.
We are the first
and only line
of professional
hair?care products
with a proprietary blend
of intoxicating pheromones
specifically designed to make
you feel confident, beautiful,
and create
positive social reactions
from those around you.
When a Laid Brand girl
walks into the room,
she instantly gets noticed.
A Laid Brand girl
gets the attention
of the cute guy in line
for coffee
because she exudes beauty
on the outside.
A Laid Brand girl
nails her job interview
because she believes
in herself.
But Laid Brand
doesn't just smell good.
It leaves your hair
looking absolutely stunning.
That's right. So we have all
these pheromones flying around,
and all of our confidence
will compel you guys
to join us to bring Laid Brand
to the world.
And with that,
Jacqueline here
is gonna hand out
some samples for you
to get some
of that phero?fabulous fragrance
and see what you like.
Okay.
[ Chuckles ]
So, what Jacqueline's
handing out
are three
of our women's products.
Across the line,
all of the products
will protect
and enhance color.
They will also protect, hydrate,
and repair the hair.
And they're also paraben?,
sulfate?, and cruelty?free.
What is a pheromone?
So, yeah,
they're chemical messengers
that are excreted
throughout sweat
and, you know,
other bodily fluids.
Each person's are unique.
Exactly. However ??
Truth is,
in the letters from Napoleon
discovered
decades after his death...
[ Laughing ]
Oh, my gosh.
...there were
many, many, many letters
to his lover, Josephine.
And when he was
on a campaign
and he'd known
he'd won the battle
and was gonna return home,
he would send a runner
all the way back to her
to tell her
not to bathe for a week...
That's so gross.
... because he wanted
the full essence of her
when he finally arrived home.
And that was
the very first use
of the human pheromone
in documented letters.
That's disgusting
and...
Not at all.
I don't even believe it.
This is why Kevin
doesn't shower or bathe.
[ Laughs ]
Adam, do you see
any challenge
with the name Laid Brand?
Would a woman want to be
a Laid Brand kind of girl?
Absolutely.
You would be shocked
at the provocative nature
of the naming
for all cosmetics now.
I don't get it,
but when I walk into Sephora
and I see
all these millennial girls
hovered around
the Urban Decay and the NARS,
not the old?school stuff
that's boring,
I say, "Wow,
we have something here."
But why not a guy's brand?
I thought it was
for men, too.
Herjavec: I thought
it was a guy product,
especially
with the name.
Yeah.
This brand had a genesis
from starting with one product
that <i>was</i> for men.
Oh.
So, to give you
the full timeline,
he started a product
in 2010, all right?
He got to a certain point,
and he said, "I need some help."
And so he found me.
I had worked
for big companies
in beauty care
for 13 years,
mostly on the female side.
And I said,
"You know what ??
you have more than
just a single product.
You have
a potential brand here.
More than just a brand,
you have a potential lifestyle."
So we launched
a couple different pilots ??
male and female products
with different types
of pheromones ??
and we launched it
into the market,
and we sold $27,000
in the first six months
at one salon
and e?commerce.
So, over the last three months,
what are your sales?
Zero ??
and here's why.
We stopped.
You stopped?
Because it wasn't working?
So ?? So, no.
You know, we had to formulate
the products and test them
in market for a while before
we even went to another salon.
I was ?? I was dying
because all I wanted to do
was go and sell it,
but I couldn't.
I had to wait
because the products
needed to be good, right?
[ Laughter ]
I'm so worried this guy's gonna
spontaneously combust.
Me too. Me too.
[ Laughs ]
We balance
each other out.
So, you did a test pilot.
That's fine.
What we're doing ??
it's so unique.
Nobody else is doing it.
?It's not so unique, though.
It's not so unique.
Your name is unique.
Using pheromones
is not unique.
And it's not
like those shelves ??
In hair care, it is.
Put that aside.
Have you talked to women?
Greiner:
Yeah, yeah. What did you do
as market research
to find out
that women like this
and respond to this
in a positive way?
From surveys through our salon
to our online sales.
And we did sell
internationally.
And you'd be amazed
at the pheromone community.
I mean, we were shocked.
?There's a pheromone ??
?There are pheromone followers?
The pheromone community
is out there.
?They meet on Friday nights.
?They are enthusiasts.
I mean, pheromones in products
are huge in Europe.
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
Derek, to ?? to ??
All right, let me ??
let me tell you
where I'm at.
Um, you just made
the point ??
Adding pheromones to a product
is not unique.
It's not difficult,
and it's not proprietary.
And, you know,
most importantly,
I like to invest in people
who have a lot of energy.
Uh?huh.
You were very flat today.
You were ??
you had no energy.
[ Laughter ]
I was gonna say,
"Oh, no."
Uh, it's gonna be
a challenge.
I'm out.
Thank you
for your consideration.
Thank you for you time.
We appreciate it.
Greiner: You know,
no one even asked you ??
what does a bottle cost?
Yeah, it's blended,
$2.50.
No, if I'm a customer
and I go online?
Yes, online ?? $24.99,
and we intentionally ??
Those margins
are fantastic,
which is why you have
so much competition.
You said earlier
in your presentation,
you've walked into Sephora,
obviously been
in the ground floor
of large department stores.
That real estate
is the most valuable on Earth.
They don't
let small guys in.
You can bounce off the walls
all day long.
They're not gonna
give you shelf space.
I'm out.
There's so many things I see
as a problem with this.
First off,
there's huge competition ??
Secondly, I sprayed it.
I didn't smell anything.
I sprayed it on Kevin ??
didn't do anything.
[ Laughter ]
There's so much here
that you're up against.
I'm out.
I'm so sorry.
Okay.
I disagree with Kevin.
I think you guys
can grind out a living.
Is it gonna be huge?
Who knows? Right?
But $30,000 doesn't get you
in the door for 10 salons.
And so, for those reasons,
I'm out.
Mark, I take objection
to you
giving them encouragement.
So...
Grind out a living
as long as they don't
have to eat or pay rent.
Cuban:
Kevin's never seen hard work,
so he doesn't
quite understand it.
I don't doubt for a moment
your sincerity.
You're just so genuine.
Thank you.
Uh, here's the problem.
I feel like I am
a walking sex goddess out there.
[ Laughs ]
We do not disagree.
Women are attracted to me.
Men are attracted to me.
All these people
are attracted to me.
?It's true!
?Dogs are attracted to me.
I can't even imagine
what would happen
if I put this stuff
on myself.
[ Laughs ]
But I'm afraid of your
pheromones, honest to God,
put on a person like me,
so I'm out.
Thank you very much.
Good luck, guys.
Thank you.
All right, thank you all
so much.
Thank you so much.
We appreciate it.
Bye.
All right.
Rauch: Oh, man.
Oh, that was awesome.
[ Sighs ]
We tried.
It's all right.
It's all right.
You know, we did
everything we could.
And we know it's unique,
so it's all good.
Yeah.
They had good advice
for us,
and we'll take that
to heart.
But you know what?
At the end of the day,
we put all of our heart
and soul into this,
and we know we're still gonna
make it huge.
