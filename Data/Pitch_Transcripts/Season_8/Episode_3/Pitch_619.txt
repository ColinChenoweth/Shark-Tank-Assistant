I'm Kara Haught.
And I'm Shelly Hyde.
And we're sisters
and best friends
from St. Cloud, Florida.
We have always
been partners in crime.
From cutting
each other's bangs
to teaching each other
how to swim,
we knew
we made a good team.
Now that we have four kids each,
nothing much has changed.
We're continuing
on all of our adventures.
We just have four
little wild ones with us.
?Whoo!
?Whoo!
Our products empower
women and mothers like us
to beautifully
and confidently
enjoy life's adventures
to the fullest.
Here comes...
Being a mom
and a business owner
have a lot of the same
skill sets.
It's hard,
and it's exhausting.
At the end of the day,
you got to get kids in bed
and orders filled,
but it's worth it.
We have invested our own money
and tons of time into this,
but it's just the two of us
handling everything right now.
We need
another set of hands.
Without an investment
from the Sharks,
our business
might not succeed.
It's really pretty.
Behind it.
This moment
is a real pinnacle for us.
Crazy dance,
and then pull it together.
Okay, okay.
One, two, three.
Okay.
[ All vocalizing ]
Man:
Three, two, wall door!
Hi. I'm Shelly Hyde.
And I'm her little sister,
Kara Haught.
We're from
St. Cloud, Florida,
and we're seeking $100,000
for 20% of our company,
Raising Wild.
Sharks, we practically grew up
wearing swimsuits.
We were raised
in Florida,
so we did anything from
lobster diving to rope swinging.
[ Chuckles ]
You name it,
and we did it
in our bathing suits.
Shelly and I now
have four kids each,
and we haven't
slowed down.
But the suits of today
can't keep up with us.
'Cause guess what?
We're not kids anymore.
So our need in a swimsuit
has completely changed.
So, we've designed
our bathing suits
for fit, fashion,
and function.
Raising Wild
is the perfect solution
to the swimsuit struggle
for women like us.
Our cuts and colors
hit at the right places
to complement a beautiful
variety of body types.
But what really
sets Raising Wild apart
is our functionality,
'cause we've added
enough length in the body
and coverage in the booty
to allow free movement.
We even have
nursing?friendly suits.
Shelly and I were raised
in a family
of 12 brothers and sisters.
Wow.
?12.
?12.
Right, ladies?
These are our three
beautiful mom models,
who also happen
to be our test market
and our three older sisters.
Oh, wow.
Hyde:
So, we are pretty sure
that you can do just about
anything in Raising Wild,
including pitch
to an entire roomful...
Of hungry Sharks.
... of hungry Sharks.
[ Laughter ]
So, now, Sharks,
while the sissies pass out
your samples,
we're gonna slip
into something...
A little more professional.
... a little more professional.
Shelly, can we see Barbara
in one of these suits?
[ Laughs ]
?We've got one for you.
?I only wear bikinis.
That's it.
Thank you very much.
Kevin should
slip into one.
Greiner: Wow.
Corcoran: So, tell us
about the background
of how you got started
in the business.
So,
being raised in Florida,
we were always on
a swimsuit hunt ?? always.
And so,
when we became mothers,
we were still looking
for bathing suits.
But the reason for swimsuits
changed for us.
But it seems shocking to me
in a state like Florida
that you couldn't find
phenomenal bathing suits.
Well, you can,
but gone are the days
of us just laying still
and looking pretty.
We still wanted
to have the edgy look
and the sophisticated look,
but still be able
to scoop down up my baby
and not have things
spill out.
Without your butt hanging out
the back, right?
?Yes.
?Yes!
Shelly,
how much are your suits?
So, our suits range
between $138 and $156.
Wow.
How does that compare
to the average?
It's ?? It's roughly
around $60.
Oh, so you're ?? you're
definitely higher?end.
So you're higher?end.
?Yeah, we are.
?Yeah, definitely.
What's
your average cost?
So, our average cost per suit
is roughly $38,
including materials.
Wow. That's a great margin.
Wow.
That's a great margin.
It's about 250% margin.
So, what is your total sales?
We can't wait to hear.
Our total sales
are $130,000.
That's not horrible.
Okay. That's not bad.
?All sold online?
?How did you sell it?
We have sold
direct to consumer,
and the only marketing
that we've done this far
is social media.
What's your vision?
How big do you think
you can get?
We actually feel
like this could go huge.
"Huge" isn't a number.
You have
about 800 customers.
Yeah.
So, how do you get
from 800 customers
to 8,000 customers?
We feel like if we can put
some money behind marketing,
that there are
potentially ??
But that's not enough.
Yeah.
is far more important
than how much you spend.
Completely agree, yeah.
And so, people get confused.
So, strategically,
you really have to dig in
and know how you're going
to test it
in order to get results.
Yeah.
Oh, for sure.
Tell me a little bit about
your ?? your background
before you were moms.
Do you have
a career in retail?
Okay, so, we're moms.
[ Chuckles ]
That means that we're
pretty much good at
everything that we do.
We are masters at it all.
You haven't ?? You haven't
worked formally
in this industry,
right?
Yeah, no, but ??
No, we haven't.
I'm gonna make
a prediction.
There's no chance in hell
you're getting $100,000
from any
of these Sharks here...
...because there's nothing
to invest in here.
At the end of the day,
"Shark Tank"
is about making money,
about investing in companies
that can provide returns.
I don't think this
is an investable company.
I'm out.
Okay, so, right now
we're doing women's suits.
We're expanding
to kids' suits.
And as we plan out
our new products,
we have this captive audience
of purchasing mothers.
You got to be
really careful, right?
When you walked in,
you said you were good
at one thing ?? two things ??
designing suits
and using social media
to sell them.
Yeah.
When we talk about growth,
we're gonna add new lines,
we're gonna expand
our marketing,
we're gonna get into retail.
Mm?hmm.
Like, that takes you away
from the organic growth
that you've been good at.
You've got
to be really careful,
because you go too wide
too fast, you drown.
?Yeah. Well ??
?Right.
You can drown
in opportunity.
Yeah.
So, for those reasons,
I'm out.
Greiner: Ladies...
Yes.
...I feel you have
a really long way to go,
a lot of work to do.
Okay.
So I don't see this
as an investment for me.
Okay.
I'm out.
So, ladies, you know,
the journey of a thousand miles
starts with a single footstep.
You've done one footstep.
Catering for a swimsuit strictly
because you're mom?oriented ??
I just don't think
it's sustainable enough.
I think this is
a very, very tough business
with a lot of big players.
I wish you all the best,
but it's way too soon for me.
I'm out.
Okay, well, thank you.
Okay.
What I wanted to say was that
we aren't gonna stop.
And we would love to have
a strategic partner and...
We'll get there.
... some infusion of cash
to be able
to get there faster.
Yep.
You know, every entrepreneur
that comes into the Tank
is loaded with passion.
The earlier in the game,
the more passion they have,
but it's never really enough.
Yeah.
I totally believe
you're committed.
Is there anything you could
point to in your past
that would help me feel
as though you have
accomplished something
in the business world ??
even a small thing ??
or stuck with
some personal journey
that you've ?? that you've
seen through to the finish line?
I?I have a son
that was just a couple years ago
diagnosed with ADHD.
This was not the plan
to tell you about this, but...
[ Voice breaking ] Okay.
He's amazing,
but he was given a reading
and a writing disability,
and they told us
it would be years
before he would be
at grade level
and that we should
hold him back.
But we spent all of
our extra time after
school helping him,
and we take him to early?morning
classes before school every day.
We dedicated our time.
And this year,
at the end of the school year,
he was reading
above his grade level.
He was the
second?highest?scoring kid
in his math class.
So, I feel like, yeah, I don't
have a business background
to say, "Look,
here it is, here I am,"
but I can work harder than
any person that is doing that,
and I've proven that.
You couldn't have hit
on a better story.
It has nothing to do
with business.
But when I go home at night,
after I've finished my workday,
I spend at least
an hour and a half
with my daughter, Kate,
who's 10, who is ADHD.
My son's 10.
She can't read.
She has
a processing disorder.
Mm?hmm.
But what I have
is a little girl
with the confidence to the moon
because she has a mother
that is totally behind her.
So, I think a mom
that could see that through,
play that hand out,
and stay with it
is probably one
of the most underestimated
accomplishments in life.
?Thank you.
?It is true.
But let me tell you ?? there's
a lot wrong with the business.
You have a mom niche that is
way too narrow, way too narrow,
because it's just a mom play.
And I've just not seen
any of them
that really work out.
Those are large obstacles
to overcome.
I am gonna make an offer...
but I feel like I have to make
a greedy offer.
in Shelly and Kara's
swimsuit company,
Raising Wild.
I am gonna make an offer...
but I feel like I have to make
a greedy offer.
I feel bad things
are going to happen.
I'd like to take 51%
of the business.
Ooh.
Ohh.
?Wow. So much love.
?[ Whistles ]
So, you understand
that Barbara's taking control
of that business?
It's just, I think you need an
experienced hand to guide you.
Yeah.
My offer is contingent
on you selling these suits
for $99.
You think about that.
Okay.
$99 ?? I think they'll
fly off the shelf.
And I think, most important,
I want you to name each model
suit after one of your sisters
and have that sister model it,
because I just think
it's gonna be really cool
that you have a huge family,
you take advantage of it.
We feel like we've worked
really hard for this company,
and it's really ??
it's ?? it's hard to give up
part of our baby like that.
We want to counter
with 35% for $100,000.
I'll tell you what ??
I'll go to 50/50...
[ Exhales sharply ]
... but not 35%.
So, you're not gonna go
any lower?
No, I won't ?? No.
But I'll be there
with credit lines
if you need more cash.
Oh, this is just so hard.
I just...
But you have
to make a decision.
Tough deals are that ??
they're tough.
We just can't give up
50% of our baby.
Cuban: Let ?? Let me help, guys.
That's like sending
two of my kids ??
Guys, let me help.
15% is the difference, right?
If you think
you can grow the business
more than an extra 15%
with Barbara's help,
that's
the decision?making factor.
So don't try
to just hold on to equity,
because the percentages
aren't what's important.
It's the value.
Haught: Well, that took us
completely by surprise.
We were not expecting
a 50% deal from Barbara.
No.
To consider it,
we will never get to where
we can go with Barbara
on our own,
so we're more than happy
to give up the 50%.
John: I'm in Silicon Valley
for the seventh annual
Global Entrepreneurship Summit
at Stanford University.
Last year, President Obama
named me as a PAGE ??
Presidential Ambassador
for Global Entrepreneurship.
The PAGE program
has three pillars ??
increasing access to capital,
education, and mentorship.
I had no idea about
the power of "Shark Tank"
all around the globe.
People from all around
the world ?? 170 countries ??
have been coming up to me
and telling me
how "Shark Tank" has helped
change their lives.
One of the best ways to help
the Cuban people succeed
and improve their lives
would be for the U. S. Congress
to lift the embargo.
John: And a few months ago,
I joined President Obama
on his historic mission
to open the doors to Cuba.
We've got a Shark here
named Daymond John.
John:
We empowered the Cuban people
through technology and business.
For the first time,
their right to have a business
was recognized
by their government.
Welcome to
the United States of America.
[ Cheers and applause ]
John: And now I'm here
at this year's summit
to help showcase the best
in entrepreneurship in America.
I'm here with President Obama,
Secretary of Commerce
Penny Pritzker,
and my fellow PAGE ambassadors.
I never expected that I would be
a little brown boy from Queens,
and now I'm sitting next to the
President of the United States.
My message to all entrepreneurs
is, believe in yourself.
You can do it.
Thank you very much.
I came from nothing
and built my own success,
and now I'm working directly
with the President
of the United States.
You have been outstanding.
When I come to these events,
I still pinch myself.
I'm talking to the President,
I'm meeting people that have
overcome huge obstacles,
and I'm so proud
to be part of it.
Narrator: Next up is a new brand
from a cookie legend.
