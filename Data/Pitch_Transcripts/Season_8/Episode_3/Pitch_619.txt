I'm Kara Haught.
Hi. I'm Shelly Hyde.
Hyde:
So, we are pretty sure
that you can do just about
anything in Raising Wild,
including pitch
to an entire roomful...
Of hungry Sharks.
... of hungry Sharks.
[ Laughter ]
So, now, Sharks,
while the sissies pass out
your samples,
we're gonna slip
into something...
A little more professional.
... a little more professional.
Shelly, can we see Barbara
in one of these suits?
[ Laughs ]
?We've got one for you.
?I only wear bikinis.
That's it.
Thank you very much.
Kevin should
slip into one.
Greiner: Wow.
Corcoran: So, tell us
about the background
of how you got started
in the business.
So,
being raised in Florida,
we were always on
a swimsuit hunt ?? always.
Shelly,
how much are your suits?
Haught: Well, that took us
completely by surprise.
We were not expecting
a 50% deal from Barbara.
No.
To consider it,
we will never get to where
we can go with Barbara
on our own,
so we're more than happy
to give up the 50%.
John: I'm in Silicon Valley
for the seventh annual
Global Entrepreneurship Summit
at Stanford University.
Last year, President Obama
named me as a PAGE ??
Presidential Ambassador
for Global Entrepreneurship.
The PAGE program
has three pillars ??
