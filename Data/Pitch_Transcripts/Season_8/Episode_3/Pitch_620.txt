Aloha, Sharks.
My name is Wally Amos.
I'm known as the Cookie Man.
?Yes, you are.
?Wow.
Oh, wow.
My new company
is The Cookie Kahuna,
and I am
from Honolulu, Hawaii,
asking for $50,000.
That's chump change
for you guys...
[ Laughs ]
...in exchange for 20%.
I've been selling cookies
for 40 years.
And for a long time,
I actually thought
I was selling cookies.
But it occurred to me that
I wasn't selling cookies.
I was selling happiness.
You ?? You ?? You guys are ??
You're not smiling.
I mean, I ?? And this guy ??
I'm smiling.
I'm smiling, Wally.
Come on. Bring it.
This guy in the middle,
though ?? Mr. Wonderful ??
he looks anything
but wonderful!
[ Laughter ]
Ohh!
I got something
that'll make you smile.
Don't go away.
Is he the Amos of Famous ??
?Yeah. Yeah.
?Yeah.
?Wow.
?He's the famous Amos.
[ Kazoo playing ]
[ Laughs ]
? Cookies for the Sharks ?
? Cookies for the Sharks ?
[ Laughter ]
?This is gonna end badly.
?Oh, very badly.
Are you guys ?? Is anybody here
allergic to cookies?
You know, you guys look the same
as you do on television.
Shocking, isn't it?
I can't believe I'm this close
to the Sharks.
Let me give Lori hers.
Does it matter?
Amos: No,
it doesn't matter to me.
All right.
I'm gonna shortcut it
for you, buddy.
Thank you.
So, let me get Barbara's
and mine.
Here. Give me mine.
?You got yours?
You're lactose ??
You're a legend.
You're a legend.
Am I a legend?
?Thank you.
?You are a legend.
Does that mean y'all gonna
give me some money?
No, but you are a legend.
Oh, my gosh!
[ Laughter ]
You're as tough
as everybody said you were.
I like them.
Yeah. They're good.
Corcoran: You have
a light, crunchy cookie.
It's good.
?Yeah.
I am the Wally Amos
who started Famous Amos
40 years ago.
You are a legend, sir.
Oh, God.
?Yes.
?Yes, sir.
?Very impressed.
?Yes.
Well, so are all of you guys.
Thank you very much.
That's ?? That's
very gracious of you.
I appreciate that.
I have a new cookie business,
which is called
The Cookie Kahuna.
I am no longer affiliated
with the original company
that I started 40 years ago.
What happened
to that company?
I came to cookies
from show business.
Years ago, I was an agent
at William Morris.
I was the first African?American
agent at William Morris.
Wow.
I booked Simon &amp; Garfunkel,
the Supremes, Marvin Gaye.
I did that for a long time.
Wow.
I started making cookies, 1970,
just to share with friends
and just to have cookies
whenever I wanted to.
But your cookies
were everywhere,
all over the world.
Oh, they were.
They were.
What went wrong was,
I'm a damn good promoter,
but I'm ?? I'm not
a business guy.
And my focus was not on how much
money I was gonna make.
I just wanted to have
a good time.
So, what happened
with the business?
They're ?? They're
still avail??
The company went
through five different owners
over a period of time.
?Wow.
?Really?
By the time, I got down,
I'd been diluted,
and I had no equity left.
I had nothing left.
They use, I believe,
your picture on the box?
My picture is still
on the packaging.
And they have the name
"Famous Amos"?
Yes, they do.
So, did they ?? did they
license that from you?
No. They own Famous Amos...
They own it.
... right out.
Tell us about
the new business.
I started this maybe a little
over a year and a half ago.
We're online.
I've got my own website.
And I sell cookies at Costco
only in Hawaii.
What do you sell it for,
Wally?
How much does it cost?
Hold on a sec.
I'm not a business guy,
but I got my numbers here.
[ Laughter ]
We liked our numbers.
Yeah, we do.
Oh, yeah,
you love your numbers.
You love your numbers
like I love my cookies.
Costco buys them for $7.89
for a one?pound bag.
And how much does it
cost you to make them?
And it costs $5.25 ??
$4.20 for ingredients.
What were your sales
for the last year?
$36,215.97
for this year so far.
Can I see the numbers, Wally?
Do you mind?
No, not at all.
Thank you, sir.
Don't ask me any questions,
though.
You're holding the numbers,
okay?
I'll answer them for you.
That wouldn't be fair.
So, Wally,
the margin you're making,
once you take in packaging,
shipping, and handling...
Mm?hmm.
... is less than 20%.
Mm?hmm.
That's bad...
Mm?hmm.
... in the food business.
It's ?? That's not
enough margin...
Mm?hmm.
... to sustain a business.
You've got to get
your costs down.
Mm?hmm.
What the numbers tell me
is your packaging
and shipping costs
are well over 40%
of the whole cost, so ??
Including
the baked goods.
?No. No.
?What?
Just the packaging.
Wally, that's worse
than I thought.
Wally, after what
you've been through...
Mm?hmm.
... starting the business,
losing the business...
Mm?hmm.
... why would you start
all over again?
Because I love cookies,
and I think that I can build
the business out of this cookie
and replicate what I did
with Famous Amos years ago.
I'm convinced I can.
One thing you bring
that very few people
that have ever come
on the Tank have had
is such a huge brand associated
with the food category.
Mm?hmm.
But we don't have
the full access
of your image
and your name,
and so it has
all the challenges
associated
with launching a new brand.
It's not investable ??
not for me, anyways.
Okay. I accept that.
I'm sorry, Wally.
I'm out.
That's cool.
No problem.
Thank you. Thank you.
Greiner: I'm a product person.
I've been in the product arena
for 18 years.
Mm?hmm.
And I've worked
with a lot of entrepreneurs.
And one of the things
that's the hardest conversation
I ever have to have with them
is about,
if they find
that something isn't working,
to go to something else.
And I'm sure,
because you have that spirit ??
you're a promoter, you have
so much inside of you ??
that there are other things
that you could be doing
with as much passion instead ??
I understand.
I understand what you're saying.
Because of that struggle,
I have to be out.
I understand that.
I accept all of that, sure.
Everybody knows your cookie.
You're a solid entrepreneur.
It's good
to love the product.
?Mm?hmm.
?Your cost is too high.
You have
limited distribution.
I'm sorry.
I'm out.
Best of luck.
?That's cool.
?Yeah.
I accept that.
Thank you, man.
Yeah. Thank you.
Corcoran: I have
a similar story to you.
If not for a lucky break,
I would have had the exact, same
thing happen in my business.
I was in business
about 10 years,
and I had a terrible turn
in the market.
And, lucky for me, just
when I thought I might
go out of business,
Merrill Lynch came in...
Uh?huh.
... and they offered me
$50,000.
They not only wanted me
to sign away Corcoran Group,
which was my brand...
Mm?hmm.
... but they wanted me to sign
away "Barbara Corcoran."
Mm?hmm.
For me,
where I was seated then...
Right.
...$50,000
was the equivalent
of having God himself
come down and kiss me.
[ Laughs ]
I can relate.
And at the 11th hour,
they changed their mind
and didn't buy it.
Mm?hmm.
And that same business,
I sold for $66 million
15 years later.
How lucky for me
that they changed their mind.
Yeah.
You know, the universe
is filled with surprises.
It's true.
But where's what
went awry here.
When you sold your business,
you not only sold the name,
but you sold your personality
along with it.
Without that, the business
has very little value.
Barbara,
what are you gonna do?
Too late.
She's not ??
She's gonna pass.
Yeah, looks like it.
Yeah, I'm gonna pass,
but with great respect.
Right, right.
Cuban:
Wally, you're a legend.
I've learned from your story,
the good and the bad,
and it taught me a lot.
My problem is, I'm already
in the cookie business.
Mm?hmm.
So it would be
a conflict for me.
Oh, no question.
So I'm out.
But thank you.
Stay tuned.
You'll watch me selling cookies.
I have no doubt,
no doubt.
[ Laughter ]
Come on, Wally.
You got to go.
[ Laughter ]
Aloha.
Alo?o?oha!
? Da?da, da?da?da ?
All: Alo?o?oha!
Aloha, guys!
?Good luck, Wally.
?See you Wally. Good luck.
[ Kazoo playing ]
Amos: I just know that this was
just another step in my journey.
So, Cookie Kahuna is gonna be
more famous than Famous Amos.
So, you guys know
the whole story of Wally?
It's an amazing lesson.
So, business was great.
He was the first,
like, high?end cookie
that got distributed
in grocery stores.
And then that brought in
some competition,
and so business
started to decline,
and so he went out
and got an investor.
But he still,
you know ??
He said, "Okay,
just give me the money.
That'll fix it all."
It didn't, and every time
he lost equity
and burned
through the cash,
he raised more money.
So he kept on getting diluted
until it was nothing.
What I did love about him is,
he was 80 years old,
and he still had the the fire,
he still had the drive.
How many of us
up here at 80 ??
He had a personality.
You look great for 80, Robert.
Come on.
