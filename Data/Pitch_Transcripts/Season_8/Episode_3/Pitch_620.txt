Aloha, Sharks.
My name is Wally Amos.
I'm known as the Cookie Man.
?Yes, you are.
?Wow.
Oh, wow.
My new company
is The Cookie Kahuna,
I'm smiling, Wally.
Come on. Bring it.
This guy in the middle,
though ?? Mr. Wonderful ??
he looks anything
but wonderful!
[ Laughter ]
Ohh!
I got something
that'll make you smile.
Don't go away.
Is he the Amos of Famous ??
?Yeah. Yeah.
?Yeah.
?Wow.
?He's the famous Amos.

? Cookies for the Sharks ?
? Cookies for the Sharks ?
[ Laughter ]
?This is gonna end badly.
?Oh, very badly.
Are you guys ?? Is anybody here
allergic to cookies?
You know, you guys look the same
as you do on television.
Shocking, isn't it?
I can't believe I'm this close
to the Sharks.
Let me give Lori hers.
Does it matter?
Amos: No,
it doesn't matter to me.
All right.
I'm gonna shortcut it
for you, buddy.
Thank you.
I am the Wally Amos
who started Famous Amos
40 years ago.
You are a legend, sir.
Oh, God.
?Yes.
?Yes, sir.
?Very impressed.
?Yes.
Well, so are all of you guys.
Thank you very much.
That's ?? That's
very gracious of you.
I appreciate that.
I have a new cookie business,
which is called
The Cookie Kahuna.
I am no longer affiliated
with the original company
that I started 40 years ago.
What happened
to that company?
I came to cookies
from show business.
Years ago, I was an agent
at William Morris.
I was the first African?American
agent at William Morris.
Wow.
I booked Simon &amp; Garfunkel,
the Supremes, Marvin Gaye.
I did that for a long time.
Wow.
I started making cookies, 1970,
just to share with friends
No. They own Famous Amos...
They own it.
... right out.
Tell us about
the new business.
What do you sell it for,
Wally?
How much does it cost?
Hold on a sec.
I'm not a business guy,
but I got my numbers here.
[ Laughter ]
We liked our numbers.
Yeah, we do.
Oh, yeah,
you love your numbers.
You love your numbers
like I love my cookies.
Costco buys them for $7.89
for a one?pound bag.
Can I see the numbers, Wally?
Do you mind?
No, not at all.
Thank you, sir.
Don't ask me any questions,
though.
You're holding the numbers,
okay?
I'll answer them for you.
That wouldn't be fair.
So, Wally,
the margin you're making,
Wally, that's worse
than I thought.
Wally, after what
you've been through...
Mm?hmm.
... starting the business,
losing the business...
Mm?hmm.
... why would you start
all over again?
Because I love cookies,
Okay. I accept that.
I'm sorry, Wally.
I'm out.
That's cool.
No problem.
Thank you. Thank you.
Greiner: I'm a product person.
I've been in the product arena
for 18 years.
Cuban:
Wally, you're a legend.
Come on, Wally.
You got to go.
[ Laughter ]
Aloha.
Alo?o?oha!
? Da?da, da?da?da ?
All: Alo?o?oha!
Aloha, guys!
?Good luck, Wally.
?See you Wally. Good luck.

Amos: I just know that this was
just another step in my journey.
So, Cookie Kahuna is gonna be
more famous than Famous Amos.
So, you guys know
the whole story of Wally?
It's an amazing lesson.
So, business was great.
He was the first,
like, high?end cookie
that got distributed
in grocery stores.
