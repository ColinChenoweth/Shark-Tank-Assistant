We are
Renata and Doug Storer,
married runners
from Orlando, Florida,
who accidentally stumbled
onto a bright idea.
We are here seeking $250,000
for a 10% stake in our company.
And the reality is,
<i>I</i> was the one who stumbled.
I was training
for my fifth marathon
on a dark, early?morning
training run
when I hit a pothole
that I couldn't see,
and took a dive.
I was injured.
I hobbled home,
I came through the door,
and I said, "Honey, I need
headlights for my sneakers!"
He actually did say that,
and he does have
a brilliant idea
every once in a while.
[ Chuckles ]
The result was
Night Runner 270 shoe lights.
They provide 270 degrees
of visibility around you...
Wow.
... 150 lumens out in front...
Oh, wow.
... with a 30?foot
beam distance
to identify any trip hazards
that might be in your path.
Night Runners
are weather?resistant...
so they will weather
the pouring rain
and uneven terrain.
Night Runner lets active people
do what they love to do
and stay safe
and injury?free.
Now, we know Sharks
love to feed in the night,
so who's hungry
for a bright idea?
[ Light laughter ]
Now, we have Night Runners
for each one of you.
Oh.
We also have some shoes,
if we have any volunteers that
would like to try them out.
Sure.
You got a size 12?
I do.
I'll pass Lori hers, too.
It would ruin my outfit.
I'm staying right here.
?Here you go, Kevin.
?Thank you.
Here you go.
So, with the shoes untied,
you slip them on
to the top row.
So, it slips ??
it goes under here like this?
Close the doors!
Cuban: It's nice.
Actually, you don't notice
that they're there.
?They look great, Mark.
?It's very cool.
You can't tell you're
wearing them, can you?
No, no.
They feel very secure.
So, what do these lights
sell for?
These lights sell
for $59.95.
We ?? We wholesale them
for $30.
What do they cost you
to make?
We get them shipped and landed
for $15.50.
We've sold 6,000 of them.
What are your sales?
Dollars to date
are $260,000.
We've only been in operation
for eight months.
Wow.
What do you think you're gonna
sell this year and next year,
and how much money
are you gonna make?
So, this year, with investment,
would be a $760,000 year,
and that's 20,000 units.
What do you mean,
"with investment"?
So, we have
enough inventory on hand
to do an organic year
of about $300,000.
You mean you don't have
enough money
to buy enough inventory
to sell more?
Right.
So, how much
do you guys have left?
We have about $15,000.
Okay. So your back's
up against the wall.
Corcoran: When I go out biking
in the morning,
I can hardly find a spot
on the road in Central Park.
That's how many bikers
are out there.
Right.
I rarely see
someone running at night,
and that's a city
of eight million people.
I mistrust the quantity of
people who want to run at night,
so I'm out,
just based on that.
Well, I?I appreciate that,
but I would like to also mention
the Night Shift basically ??
Oh, there's more?
?There is more.
?Oh.
It's called
the Night Shift.
It's for
the occupational?safety market.
It is for people
who work at night.
It is for construction workers,
D. O. T. road workers.
Ohh, you're going
way out there now.
No, that's not bad.
That's smart.
No, this is a way ??
Anybody who works in the dark
that has shoelaces.
Greiner: It's important,
because they get hit by cars.
They do.
That's a little more
interesting,
because I could see
broader investment applications.
Yeah, you put this
on a work boot.
I mean, part of the problem
is you named it Night Runner,
and there's your work boots
right there.
Well, that's why
the ?? the new model
will be ?? be called
Night Shift.
This is
the real game changer.
We know we can get our feet wet
with the athletic market,
but the occupational?safety
market,
we feel,
can be much bigger.
Herjavec: But, like,
why can't you do that right now?
Why can't the existing product
do that?
Just ?? Just resources.
If you got to work
an entire shift,
you need it to last
8 to 10 hours.
Oh, it's the battery life
that's the problem.
?Did we...
?It's ?? Yeah.
These are meant
for over four hours.
I think you guys
have done a great job.
I think we can really help you
with expanding the product line.
I'll give you the $250,000
for 30%.
Okay, so, I like it, too.
I was thinking
I was gonna go out,
but when you showed me
the product
for the industrial?safety
and walking market,
that got my juices flowing.
That makes a lot more sense
to me.
If it becomes
a standard safety item,
the mining industry's
gonna be huge with this,
the security market
at night.
That really appeals to me.
I would do this ??
$250,000 for 15%.
You've got to grab that
right away.
Yes?
Greiner:
I got a question for you.
Okay.
You could take
Kevin's offer,
or you could take
Robert's offer.
Or you could take
what's behind door number two.
Wouldn't you be
door number three by now?
I don't have to be number three.
It's door number two.
So, you want to ask yourself,
"Do I feel lucky?"
Narrator: One Shark is out.
Renata and Doug
have two offers on the table
for their shoe light,
Night Runner 270.
But Lori also seems interested.
Do you have an offer,
Lori?
$300,000 for 20%.
So, I'm gonna give you
a little bit more money,
asking a little more equity.
I'm not a runner.
I'm a walker.
But I love it
because it's just smart product.
Right.
And that's why I want
to be involved with it ??
'cause product's what I do.
Wow.
Well, thank you very much.
I tell you, preparing
for this opportunity...
?Hmm.
?Hmm.
... we said, "Gosh,
every single one of you
offers something..."
What a schmoozer.
"...that we need."
So, we are ?? Our sales
are increasing in
the Southern hemisphere.
Remember, you have three offers
on the table.
Why are you keeping everybody
waiting as you're selling?
Out of respect,
just out of respect.
Stop selling.
Focus on the offers.
Okay.
So, you have three offers ??
Robert's $250,000 for 30%...
Right.
... Lori's $300,000 for 20%,
and I'm $250,000 for 15%.
Mm?hmm.
You've got to kind of
make a decision.
Hey, Doug, so, listen ??
I'm gonna change my offer.
I'll give you $200,000
for 15%,
because I think that's
the cash to buy inventory,
get the product out.
On top of that, I'll give you
$150,000 as a pure loan.
Okay.
So, my total offer is $350,000,
in effect, for 15%.
But $150,000 of it is debt.
Is a loan.
I'll throw in an offer
just to tell you where I'm at.
It's gonna take
a lot of work.
So, what I'll do is I'll
offer you the 250K for 30%,
but I'll offer you unlimited
purchase?order financing.
Mark's going the other way.
He's back up to the 30%.
Could we have a minute
to talk about this?
?Absolutely.
?Thank you.
We're not gonna go far.
[ Sighs ]
So, what do you think?
These are all
good offers.
Robert obviously is the most
in tune with ?? with running.
It's a lot of work.
I'm not saying
the other ones aren't.
I don't like it
for the running market.
I like it
for everything else.
But Kevin believes in
the occupational?safety market.
Right.
That's the highest valuation.
Right.
What about going in all together
for the 30%?
Count me out.
I don't even get this product.
If we're gonna do that,
why don't we go up
to 35% or something?
?Yeah, why don't you?
?Why don't we?
They're
at their last $15,000.
Guys, before ?? before
you start,
while you were away,
we also talked amongst
ourselves, okay?
One of the risks
of leaving the room.
And that's always a risk
in "Shark Tank."
Sometimes it's good.
Sometimes it's bad.
Let me explain.
You've now got two offers
across four Sharks,
broken up this way ??
Mark's offer is ??
he's the lone wolf now.
He's gonna make you
that offer ??
$250,000 for 30%.
And the financing.
The other three Sharks
really like that offer a lot.
We're gonna make the same.
You're gonna get three Sharks
for the same amount.
We'll give you the $250,000
for 30%, three Sharks,
with all the benefits
they have.
They decided to copy me
for obvious reasons.
But, you know,
competition happens.
We all like the deal, so ??
Herjavec: Well, we ?? we ??
I think we thought
you were willing
to give up more equity.
I'll be honest
with you.
We came in here looking at 20%
being a ?? being a ceiling.
Is there ??
Is there any offers
that would cap the equity
at 20%?
?Not mine.
?Okay.
Not ours.
You just got
a lot of work to do.
If you really want the benefit
of multiple Sharks,
you got to leave them a little
bit of meat on the bone.
Greiner:
Well, you came back in
saying you wanted to do it
for 20%.
Right?
?Yes.
And I had offered you $300,000
for 20%.
So, I would do the $250,000
for 20%.
Oh, you're leaving
the team now.
[ Chuckles ]
?Interesting.
?Well...
That's a Sharky move.
There's no unity on the team
anymore.
Obviously, these alignments
can fall out of favor
very quickly.
But I'm a Shark.
So...
O'Leary:
But I would do the ??
You got to kind of take that
right now.
I'll go back to mine.
I'll do the $250,000 for 15%.
And, Doug, you know what?
I'll go back to my ??
?Wow.
?That's amazing!
I will go back
to my original offer.
I'll give you
my original offer ??
$300,000 for 20%.
I'll do $350,000 for 15%.
I don't believe this.
It's nuts.
?Oh, my God.
Would you like a notepad?
[ Chuckling ] Yes.
Robert is $200,000 for 15%,
plus $150,000 of debt
for your inventory,
Lori is $300,000 for 20%,
and I am $250,000 for 15%,
and Mark is $250,000 for 30%.
For 30% still.
With unlimited financing.
Okay.
All right,
what do you guys want to do?
Okay.
[ Indistinct whispering ]
?Okay.
?Let's do it.
All right, first of all,
thank you so much
for all of the offers.
I?I want to ask Kevin ??
Yeah?
Do you have the same passion
for the other markets
that you do the
occupational?safety market?
I have a passion
to make money.
You show me the direction
you want to put your focus on,
I'll support you.
Doug, you need somebody that
knows this market with you...
I know this market.
... that ?? that actually
uses a product.
Why did you ask me
that question?
I'll do the $250,000
for 15%
and the $100,000
of it as a loan.
It doesn't matter.
You're getting $350,000 in cash.
Don't make an investment
with somebody
who doesn't actually understand
or use the product.
I mean, that's just ??
That's ridiculous.
That's a really
ridiculous statement.
The only time Kevin runs
is to lunch.
I'm a fine?tuned athlete.
I could kick his ass in squash
every day.
Robert,
let me ask you this ??
Herjavec: Yes, sir?
Would you go in with Lori
at 20% for two Sharks?
I'm in.
Lori?
?No. I'm sorry.
?Okay.
I think, if it were
the two of us together,
like we were doing before,
then you have to be at the 30%.
Okay.
So, then, Robert, I accept
your offer of $250,000 at 15%.
Wow.
?Interesting outcome.
?And that's Robert.
I'm going with Lori.
I'm going with Kevin.
?Oh, thank you.
?Thank you, guys.
Thank you so much.
Cuban: Congratulations, guys.
Congrats.
?Appreciate it.
?That was great.
?Thanks for the shoes.
?You're welcome.
Thank you!
Wow.
Doug: I think we walked
out of the Tank
looking at each other and
saying, "What just happened?"
And we're still trying
to figure that out.
But we know that
with Robert on board,
we've got a bright future.
Herjavec:
A lot of stuff happened.
We got together.
The Sharks hate each other.
Lori turned on me.
[ Greiner laughs ]
They played their hand
really well.
They were very calm.
All they did was let the Sharks
go at each other.
I know.
And she was freaking out
the entire time...
But they didn't
move on it.
...'cause they knew
they had no cash.
15 grand in the bank ??
that's scary.
They were smart.
Good luck, Robert.
