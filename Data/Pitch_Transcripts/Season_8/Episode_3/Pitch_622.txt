Hi. I'm Adam Cookson.
Hi. I'm Craig Beinecke.
We're from
Denver, Colorado.
Our company is TekDry.
We're seeking $500,000
in exchange for 5%
of our company.
[ Exhales ]
Sharks...
this toilet stands
before you today
guilty
of a terrible crime ??
[ Chuckles ]
Murder.
That's right.
This porcelain perpetrator
is the number?one reason
people lose phones
to water damage.
[ Light laughter ]
It doesn't stop there.
Toilets, swimming pools,
washing machines.
Each year in the U. S.,
these kill 22 million phones
with water damage.
We've invented a machine
that can bring phones,
tablets, laptops, watches ??
basically anything that fits
in the chamber ??
back to life.
?Wow.
?It's not magic.
[ Laughter ]
Have a look inside our machine
in real time,
transforming liquid
into gas,
restoring your phone
in just 30 minutes.
No need to disassemble
or take anything apart.
Sharks,
this is my personal phone.
It has no
special protection.
But I'm not worried.
?No!
?No!
I'm not worried.
[ All scream ]
Aah!
You murderer!
[ Laughs ]
So, let's make a deal,
Sharks.
This is one opportunity
you don't want to flush away.
Corcoran: Oh, gosh.
[ Chuckles ]
I'm gonna take a moment
to rescue this phone
and then show you
our process.
This is a gut?wrenching moment
for customers.
[ Chuckles ]
Bring it in for service
as quick as you can.
Your device starts rusting
as soon as it gets wet.
So, inside the chamber,
we have special metallic beads.
What these do
is surround any device inside
with a warm, gentle heat.
The device...
[ Beads rustle ]
... goes inside.
Then what the machine
will do
is remove all of the air
from the chamber.
And the combination of that
plus the gentle heat
turns all the liquid
into gas
and makes it leave the phone
instantly.
?Oh, wow.
?Interesting.
By the time that you get
into the machine,
maybe the phone's gone.
So, I feel
it's like a heart attack.
You got to get CPR fast.
Right.
You want to come
as quick as possible,
and certainly best results
are the same day it got wet,
but we've saved devices
several days later.
Really? So, technically,
someone could ship it to you.
Like, are you online,
or are you a store?
Yeah.
We're currently
in 82 big?box retail stores,
as well as we have
a mail?in service.
But what are your sales?
So, last year,
with just a few stores,
we did $29,000.
No, you didn't say a few.
You said you have 82 big?box.
?82 stores, right?
?Just ??
We're talking
about last year.
Yeah, and in November ??
Sorry, Craig, did you say
that last year you sold
the incredible amount of ??
how much?
$29,000 in sales...
Say it again.
... with just
a few stores.
We've focused on
making the economics
on a per?store basis
profitable.
Mm?hmm.
And then we launched
to 82 stores,
and only two months later,
we've been asked to launch
to 600 stores.
But what were your sales after
the balance of the stores?
This year, we're on track with
the expansion to hit $650,000.
So, you go to a store and you
say, "Put this in for free,"
or do they pay you?
Oh, you don't pay
unless it works.
They'll charge the customer
$69 for a...
?You sell it to them?
?$69 is expensive.
How much does it cost
to make one?
So, in the beginning,
at low production rates,
it was over $8,000 to make one
of these machines.
?[ Laughs ]
?$8,000?
Now it's ?? Now it's less
than $3,000.
What do you charge them
for the rent on that box?
So, on average, it works out
to about $80 rent a month.
Wait. So, $80 rent per month
you're charging them?
And then on top of that,
we get a rev share ??
a percentage
of the revenue...
What's ?? What's
the percentage?
On average,
it's about 60%.
So, in order to do all this,
you had to have raised
a bunch of capital.
We've raised $2.2 million
so far.
?Wow.
?That's the key.
And what was the value
of the company post?money?
It had a valuation cap
of $4.8 million.
So, why is your valuation
so high?
This is about getting
to $800 per month per store.
That's $6 million in revenue
and $3.5 million in profit.
But you're not
doing that today.
No, but if you
discount that back
from when
we will be doing it,
that's still
far above $10 million.
And what do you place
as a value on that risk
in case you don't execute?
Greiner:
You know, honestly, like,
I see you totally
as an online business.
We ?? We ??
You said you have three days,
right,
in which
it can still survive?
We have an online market,
but we haven't
been able to afford
national marketing
for the online.
I don't understand why you think
you want to go retail.
I don't see the big market.
I'm out.
Thank you.
You came in asking
for a $10 million valuation,
and I don't know how you're
gonna make that back that fast.
And so, unfortunately,
for that reason, I'm out.
I think technology
is your enemy.
I was reading something
the other day
that the new Apple phone is
almost totally water?resistant.
So, I think that
technology improvements
can put you out of business
by the time
you figure out your model.
I wouldn't put my money there.
I'm out.
Guys, look,
I like the idea.
I like the concept.
But you're gonna have
to keep on raising capital.
And unless I gave you
that capital,
I'm gonna keep on
getting diluted.
The problem is,
how do I get my money back?
You know, one of the reasons
I think we're gonna succeed
is not just because
we may have a good plan.
It's because we have
an awesome team.
Have you ever heard
anybody start a company,
hire their people, and say,
"We have a horrible team"?
That's not enough.
I'm out.
Herjavec:
Okay, everybody's out.
Mr. Wonderful's left.
I like the story.
I understand the model.
I?I don't want to argue about
your valuation.
I think it's too high.
I'm gonna loan you
the 500K at 13%,
but I'm taking the 5%
as an equity warrant.
That's the value I bring
as a Shark to this.
So, I want it paid back
in 36 months.
What do you think
of this offer?
Would you be willing to go
more than $500,000?
Right now,
you asked for $500,000.
That's the deal I would do.
And I'm the only Shark
here today
willing to give you
an offer.
So, what do you want to do?
Cookson: We're not worried
about this debt.
Mr. Wonderful,
we're gonna pay you back
and then some.
Actually,
I shouldn't say that.
[ Both laugh ]
