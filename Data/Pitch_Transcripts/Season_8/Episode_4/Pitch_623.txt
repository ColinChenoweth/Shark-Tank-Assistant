Hi, I'm Monica Ferguson.
And I'm Becca Brown.
And we're here today
to tell you about
our company Solemates.
We're seeking $500,000
in exchange for a 10% equity
stake in our business.
Wow. Whoo!
Brown: We have a product
that's changing the world
for women.
Women have a special
relationship with shoes,
especially high heels.
High heels make us taller,
longer, and leaner,
but these benefits
come at a high cost.
And we've all
been there ??
You're at an outdoor wedding,
dressed to the nines,
when all of a sudden your heel
sinks into the grass.
Or you're walking down
a city street
in your favorite stilettos
when your heel gets stuck
in a sidewalk crack
or subway grate.
It's so annoying,
completely embarrassing,
and, not to mention,
ridiculously expensive,
ruining all those shoes.
The Solemates High Heeler
is a heel cap
that prevents high heels
from sinking into grass
and getting stuck
in cracks.
It works by
increasing the surface area
on the base of the heel,
which dissipates the pressure
and prevents the heel
from sinking or getting stuck.
Wearing Solemates
liberates women
to walk across any surface,
looking and feeling
her absolute best.
So, Sharks, which one of you
will be our soul mate?
Becca,
are you wearing them?
We both are.
We're both wearing them.
And we also have samples
to give you.
So you're wearing dark
to match your dark heel...
Ferguson: Yes.
Brown: Exactly.
Greiner: But you can snap on
a clear one.
Absolutely.
They come in clear, black,
silver, and gold.
Ferguson: Kevin?
Thank you.
Herjavec:
How much do they cost?
Each pair retails
for $10.
The box that you're holding
has three pairs in it
for three different sizes,
and that's $30.
$30 for this?
Greiner:
Can I see silver and gold?
Absolutely.
I'm just curious.
Your margins
must be incredible.
With the shoe.
Before we jump into
a lot of the specifics,
we'd love for you to try out
the product firsthand.
So, Lori, we actually have
a pair of heels for you.
Herjavec: Why Lori?!
Not to ??
not to exclude ??
Why ?? Why Lori?
Why not me?
Brown: Not to exclude
the gentleman.
We invite you to come up,
as well.
Yeah.
Do you have my shoes my size?
Absolutely.
O'Leary: Robert ??
Robert, get up there.
Well,
we have a pair for you.
Greiner: Oh, wow.
Ain't gonna happen.
Robert?
These are for you.
Which ones?
That one.
So,
Daymond and Robert ??
No, actually,
this is Mark's size.
[ Laughs ]
Robert: One is ??
Fall off and ??
Fall off and break my ankle?
One has the product
and one doesn't.
Greiner: Oh, my God.
All right, Daymond!
Is that weird that I feel
very comfortable in these?
[ Laughter ]
Greiner: Yeah.
I think they're ??
You wear them
really well.
[ Laughs ]
All right, try it.
So, now you're stepping
in the grass.
Greiner: Try it here.
The worst ?? I'm sticking.
Ferguson: The one on the left
has it on,
the one on the right
does not.
Oh, so that's
how you try them.
Brown: You see?
Herjavec: Big difference.
Greiner: Do you feel it?
Huge difference.
Yeah, huge difference.
I ?? I do feel
the difference.
Once you get used to
walking in heels...
Brown: Mark,
step up to the challenge?
...it's a huge difference.
That's okay.
O'Leary: This is not ??
Brown: There you go.
This is not
a good thing for you.
This is a not a good look.
[ Laughter ]
Herjavec: I'm not sure
that helped your product.
What's your background?
Becca and I met, actually,
working at Goldman Sachs
right after college.
Uh, we there for several years
in different roles.
What happened?
[ Laughs ]
It was a great experience.
We learned a lot.
Genuinely, one of the reasons
that we're here today is
because one of the first things
we were taught there
was you're not expected
to know everything,
but you are expected to know
who to go to for everything.
And in this case, we're here
because you are who to go to.
I'm getting really excited,
'cause your in my space.
Brown: Yes.
You're in banking ??
You know, I mean, in shares...
Oh, I thought high heels?
High heels?
...ETFs ??
But I'm waiting to hear...
Kevin.
...how you're gonna take me
across into
the valuation metrics...
Yes.
... of this business,
which you're reputing
a $5 million valuation on.
Yes.
Bring it on, girls.
So, last year we did
$1.1 million in revenues.
What?
Wow. Really?
We're on track to do
$1.3 to $1.5 this year.
Herjavec: Hang on.
We've been in business
five years.
Yes?
O'Leary: Whoa.
How did you do $1. ??
Where are you selling?
In my wildest dreams,
I didn't think
you had done $1 million.
We're sold in about 3,000
retail doors in this country,
including Nordstrom,
DSW, David's Bridal.
Brown: This a product
that women a lot of times
don't know they need
until they're
sinking into the grass
and experiencing it
firsthand.
And when a woman finds out
that this product exists,
she has to have it.
She is
a lifetime customer.
Ferguson: Yes.
The next benefit we have,
is that we are highly correlated
to the wedding industry
and the women's
shoe industry.
We sit right in the middle,
and when women see other women
wearing Solemates in the grass,
they say, "What is that?"
And then
they will order them
for their next wedding
or party.
But you're not making
any cash flow yet, are you?
We're not bec??
We've broken even,
so our
gross profit margins ??
Including paying yourself
something?
Yes.
65% gross profit margins ??
Yes.
How much
have you guys invested?
So, we, together,
invested $100,000
when we quit our jobs
at Goldman to start this.
And you've raised?
To date, we've raised
just under $1 million.
Wow.
Whoa.
How did you raise it?
Wow.
From angels ??
friends.
Friends.
How many partners are there
in the business?
Monica and I both,
together, own 80%, 40/40.
Fantastic product.
Thank you.
The challenge is ??
Your sales
will really go boom
the more convenient
the product is to buy.
Yes.
Yes.
So, do you sell it to ??
who?
The hotels,
the wedding planner ??
Everywhere ??
Hotel gift shops,
wedding planners, boutiques.
You have to be
everywhere.
We sell to venues,
we sell to hotels,
but it's fragmented
right now.
I mean,
how do you blow that up?
Do you have to find
a distributor that
sells that stuff,
or do you just need to hire
a team of people?
Bandwidth ??
it's a bandwidth issue.
It's the two of us,
and we have one
full?time person.
And what does
the full?time person do?
She's our operations manager,
office manager.
Cuban: Guys, something's
not adding up for me though.
You've got, um, 65% margins
against $1 million in sales.
So you've got $650,000
in gross margin dollars.
There's only three of you.
Where's it going?
We work with
third?party employers,
so we have a ??
our graphics designers,
photographers,
web developers.
What was
your net profit?
$30,000.
How much did you pay
yourself?
Last year,
$80,000 each.
Each?
Okay.
Well, there you go.
Okay.
So, $160,000 ??
So, now I get it.
Greiner:
To me, the problem is
it's not something that people
need or need badly.
I don't know if I agree.
Because when you ??
Well, you don't wear
high heels.
He does now.
[ Laughs ]
Uh, there's only
a certain amount of women
that wear
spiky high heels.
Mm?hmm.
And they're a lot that
will only wear flats,
wedges, et cetera,
'cause they are
more comfortable,
and they're more stable.
But they're occasions
when you want to wear
a stiletto...
No, of course.
... and the product
acts like
an insurance policy
on that shoe.
If you're spending
$100 on a pair of shoes
or $1,000
on a pair of shoes,
you don't
want to ruin them.
I'm not saying
it's not a problem.
I'm just wondering how big
a problem for women is it?
For me, this isn't
the right investment...
Yeah.
So, I'm out.
Okay.
Okay.
The numbers
don't add up for me,
and that's
part of the problem.
$5 million valuation,
10%, right, $500,000 ??
In order for me
to get that back,
you got to make $5 million
in profits, right?
I don't see how you guys
are gonna get to
$50 million in sales.
That's my problem.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Appreciate that.
We believe
in this business.
We are committed to it.
We would never have quit
our jobs if we were not.
While we're doing
just over $1 million in sales,
we know we can do
$20 million, $30 million,
$40 million,
$50 million in sales.
John: So ?? So, let's say
you're gonna go up to
$50 million in sales.
Uh, the net's
not gonna be the same.
There's gonna be
a lot of R&amp;D.
Right.
There's gonna be
a lot of expansion in there,
and you're gonna have
to put a lot of money
back in the business.
You literally would have to do
$5 million a year...
In profits.
... 10 years,
and then maybe I would, uh,
make back just my investment,
no profit.
I don't even think we're gonna
have grass at that time.
So, uh, for that reason,
I'm out.
Herjavec:
Ladies, I think women
may not have been built
to wear stilettos,
but any product that makes
a man or a woman look good
and is comfortable
is a home run.
I mean, to me,
you're creating
a brand?new category.
It ?? It's kind of like
a SPANX.
It didn't exist.
I know
it's a wider category,
but I love the idea,
and your sales
prove themselves.
You need a team,
you need more people.
Your costs
are actually gonna rise.
I mean,
it's a long preamble to tell you
I'm gonna give you an offer
that you may not like,
but that's okay,
'cause I like it.
Monica and Becca's shoe
accessory company Solemates.
I believe
in the two of you,
but $500,000 for 10%
is just nuts.
I'll give you $500,000
for 25%.
You're either
gonna get acquired
and you're gonna create
a brand?new category.
And the only way I'm ever
gonna get the $500,000 back
is to help you scale this thing
to substantial size.
So, there's only
one person left.
O'Leary: Yeah.
What are you doing?
I'm ?? I'm probably ??
I sell a lot of products
to women.
I sell a lot products ??
in the celebration times
we do everything.
I'm really struggling
with this.
And I like it. I like it.
All right, Kevin.
I can actually see
selling a lot of it.
Go ahead ?? $2 per pack?
I might change the structure
a little bit...
Are you writing
another book?
because...
There you go.
Here we go. Here we go.
The ?? The equity ??
Royalty.
Let me finish.
Silence while I bring out
the genius of my offer,
and learn something
from it.
Here comes the deal.
Whatever.
This is important.
I'll give you 100K for 10%,
and I'll loan the business
$400,000,
'cause I think the business
is only worth a million
bucks right now.
Herjavec:
You're saying the business
is only worth $1 million today?
That's what I just said.
That's what I think it's worth.
With all due respect,
Kevin's offer's crazy.
When you're this small,
to take on
that amount of debt
and try to service it,
It ??
Robert, would you be willing
to go to 20%?
Really?
5% is gonna make a difference?
It does make a difference
to us.
Why? Explain to me why.
I don't ??
In order for us to maintain
a slight majority...
Cuban: Right.
... cumulatively,
20% would be
more meaningful to us.
Because they only own
80% right now.
Got it.
