My name is Jared Whetstone.
I'm from St. Augustine, Florida,
the oldest city
in the United States,
Whetstone:
Our factory makes products
I'm Jared Whetstone
from St. Augustine, Florida,
Can we try it, Jared?
O'Leary:
Show us what they are.
Absolutely.
Of course you're
giving samples, right?
I assume it comes
in lots of flavors.
It does.
The one
you're about to taste is, uh ??
has a tint of orange,
hope you don't mind.
Thanks, Jared.
Appreciate it, buddy.
Whetstone: These are special
"Shark Tank" edition ??
Herjavec:
Ooh, these are cool.
Ahh! Oh!
Look what came in mine!
There's six Sharks
to collect ??
I got a Kevin!
John: I got a Robert.
Cuban: I got a Daymond.
I got a Lori.
This is just the ??
to symbolize the type of toy ??
But we can coincide with ??
O'Leary: W?? Why was it illegal
to put a toy in a chocolate?
Whetstone:
Okay, back in the 1930s,
a company in the U. S.
thought it was a good idea
to put metal toys
in solid?milk chocolate bars
for kids to find, right?
Right. Yeah. Oh.
So, Jared...
Clever.
... Let's say
that's all correct,
So, Jared, the $2.5 million
you did last year,
the substantial part of that
was from this one licensee?
Yes.
But they're
gone now.
They're gone.
So you won't do
$2.5 million this year,
But, Jared,
how are you increasing
when you lost many of
your sales last year?
We ?? We have existing ??
We still have existing
contract manufacturing
with other companies.
Are you only talking about
this type of product,
or you're ?? You're giving us
the entire number
that your company does
from regular chocolate bars,
everything else?
Total. Total.
Do you do regular?
Right ??
So our niche is that
we have been known
throughout the industry
as manufacturers
of complex chocolate articles.
Okay?
L?Let me explain.
Let me help.
Jared, let me help.
So ??
Well, would you want
to get up there
Jared, I ?? I see
what you're doing here,
I'm sorry, Jared.
I ?? I have no interest in going
on the journey with you.
I'm out.
Good luck, Jared.
Thanks, guys.
Greiner:
Good luck, Jared.
We're rooting for you.
