My name is Jared Whetstone.
I'm from St. Augustine, Florida,
the oldest city
in the United States,
and my company
is Atlantic Candy Company.
How's it running?
Man: It's running good.
All right, man.
I'm a third?generation
chocolatier.
My grandparents started
selling chocolate and ice cream
to tourists in the 1960s.
They opened up a store
which eventually became
a chocolate factory.
Yeah, these cells
are working a lot better now.
Whetstone:
Our factory makes products
for some of the biggest names
in the candy industry,
but we want to own our brands
and create our own products.
The assembly right here
and the top robot here.
My dad created and patented
a manufacturing technique
to make a popular candy product
that's sold all over the world.
It just hasn't been introduced
in the United States.
There's a lot at stake here.
For me, this is personal.
I've seen
how hard my dad's worked,
and I'm determined
to help him succeed.
I'm pitching on my own,
because my dad has to stay
back home and run the factory.
He's pretty busy.
But I'm pretty confident
that I'll go in there
and do a good job
and make him proud.
I'm Jared Whetstone
from St. Augustine, Florida,
and I'm here today
with the Atlantic Candy Company
seeking $1 million
in exchange ??
In exchange for 10%
of my company.
Can we try it, Jared?
O'Leary:
Show us what they are.
Absolutely.
Of course you're
giving samples, right?
I assume it comes
in lots of flavors.
It does.
The one
you're about to taste is, uh ??
has a tint of orange,
hope you don't mind.
And I'm gonna grab one
for Lori.
I like chocolate
in the morning.
Okay, thank you so much.
There you go, Lori.
Mr. Wonderful.
Herjavec:
I like the packaging.
Very cute packaging.
Yeah. I love that.
Thanks, Jared.
Appreciate it, buddy.
Whetstone: These are special
"Shark Tank" edition ??
Herjavec:
Ooh, these are cool.
Ahh! Oh!
Look what came in mine!
There's six Sharks
to collect ??
I got a Kevin!
John: I got a Robert.
Cuban: I got a Daymond.
I got a Lori.
This is just the ??
to symbolize the type of toy ??
But we can coincide with ??
O'Leary: W?? Why was it illegal
to put a toy in a chocolate?
Whetstone:
Okay, back in the 1930s,
a company in the U. S.
thought it was a good idea
to put metal toys
in solid?milk chocolate bars
for kids to find, right?
Right. Yeah. Oh.
And kids were
cracking their teeth
and choking on them, right?
Well, how does Kinder Egg
get around it?
Okay, they're legal
in every other country
in the world, right,
except the United States.
They're, um ??
Are you saying
Kinder Eggs
aren't sold
in the states?
They're not.
In Germany...
and everywhere else.
In Canada.
They're in ?? They're in
every other country in the world
except the United States.
Why is that good news?
Why are we
going to get around the FDA
when Kinder Eggs,
the number?one player can't?
Okay, my father
invented and patented
that capsule
you're holding in your hand.
Yes. Got it.
That capsule,
if you look at it,
that ridged design
complies with the FDA.
The FDA bans non?nutritive items
from being embedded in food.
This capsule design
is not embedded.
As you noticed
when you unwrapped it,
the two
chocolate halves...
Right?
...came together,
but it never actually touches.
Okay.
So, Jared...
Clever.
... Let's say
that's all correct,
and it's an exciting
opportunity you had.
I give you
a $1 million for 10%
impugning
a $10 million valuation
and your sales today are?
Last year,
they were $2.5 million.
Yeah.
Oh.
Where are you selling?
Okay,
so it's important to note
that we have been
contract manufacturers.
For example,
this Australian company,
they approached my father
and licensed
his patented capsule design
to manufacture
these types of products
for sale in the U. S.
The 10?year
manufacturing agreement
with the Australian company
terminated
December 31st of last year.
We are free to manufacture
this type of product.
But here's the deal ??
There's only two years
of patent life
left on this patent.
Whoa.
Ohh.
Whoa.
So, now you're
looking for capital
to help you go
after this market.
Yes.
Except they'll be lots
of competition in 24 months?
Right, that's why speed ??
That's why speed
to market's important.
O'Leary:
So when I think about it
as an investor,
holiday is a big time
for chocolates ??
Easter, Hanukkah,
Christmas.
Sure.
Those are the times
of which there's only
one or two cycles left of that.
Why would anybody
value this at $10 million
if they've got 18 months
to cash in on it?
It is unusual.
So, Jared, the $2.5 million
you did last year,
the substantial part of that
was from this one licensee?
Yes.
But they're
gone now.
They're gone.
So you won't do
$2.5 million this year,
and your patent runs out
in about 20 months.
Absolutely.
So, we have immediate
production capacity
of 18 million units a year
at our factory
in St. Augustine, Florida.
Do you own a factory?
Yes.
We've got machines
on order.
This time next year,
we're ??
We're planning to have
over 100 million units
of capacity.
Why are you ??
Why are you expanding?
Uh, we believe in
this product category,
and we are ??
We are going to compete
with this
product category.
Okay, so how much do you
expect to do in sales?
$3.3 million in sales
this year.
But, Jared,
how are you increasing
when you lost many of
your sales last year?
We ?? We have existing ??
We still have existing
contract manufacturing
with other companies.
Are you only talking about
this type of product,
or you're ?? You're giving us
the entire number
that your company does
from regular chocolate bars,
everything else?
Total. Total.
Do you do regular?
Right ??
So our niche is that
we have been known
throughout the industry
as manufacturers
of complex chocolate articles.
Okay?
L?Let me explain.
Let me help.
Jared, let me help.
So ??
Well, would you want
to get up there
and actually give
his presentation for him?
Atlantic Candy is
a contract manufacturer, right,
of chocolate items.
Yes, sir.
Your projection is to do
$3.3 million in sales
as a contract manufacturer.
Now, you have
this opportunity over here,
so if you were
looking for capital
and Shark expertise to rush it
to market, because ??
To it's ??
To exploit the category.
Jared, I ?? I see
what you're doing here,
and it's admirable.
The problem for me,
as an investor,
is you have to rush.
I don't know the contract
manufacturing business,
plus going out
and selling to the retailers.
I'd have to learn.
And in a rush scenario
like this,
I don't think
it'd be a good fit.
So, for those reasons,
I'm out.
Thank you, Mark.
So, here's
how I feel about it ??
I, um ??
My biggest challenge is
that you've never
serviced retail,
and it's a totally
different game.
When you're dealing
with retailers,
you are basically
at their mercy.
They're gonna test goods,
then you're gonna have
to be compliant, then ??
They're gonna also leverage you
against other people
and see who else can come up
with a better price,
and because you
don't have years of
that experience,
I'm out.
Thank you, Daymond.
You know, you have a patent
that's about to run out,
so anybody else can do it.
I'm concerned
about the fact
that you only have
a handful of months left.
I'm out.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, Jared.
I ?? I have no interest in going
on the journey with you.
I'm out.
I understand. Thank you.
Good luck, Jared.
Thanks, guys.
Greiner:
Good luck, Jared.
We're rooting for you.
