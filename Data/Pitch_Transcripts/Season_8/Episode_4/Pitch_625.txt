My name's Doug Foreman.
I'm from Austin, Texas.
I'm seeking $500,000
for 5% equity of my company.
Now, Sharks,
if you love cooking, eating,
Foreman: We actually have
a motion detector
so that as soon as
you lift it up,
Foreman: Right.
... the heat
starts to work.
Yes.
It melts the butter.
Foreman:
Right now it's at $43,
but we're also, you know,
working it down.
Is it patented?
It's patent pending.
Doug, you're pretty savvy,
right?
Yeah.
You came in here, you ??
Wait, wait.
I want to hear the answer.
You probably know who you
want to be partners with.
Well, I want an answer,
too, which ?? I have
an offer on the table.
No, I want to know
if he's having issues
with it clogging, or ??
I think
all that's crap, Lori.
Lori,
I think all that is crap.
You're as real as it gets,
a proven entrepreneur.
You're coming back
to where you have experience,
you know how to get this stuff
out there,
So, Doug, I ?? I just have
a question around in the ??
Doug, you have two offers
on the table.
Herjavec: Is there a feature
from the product that
we can we take away
in a model
Foreman: Thank you.
I like that you have
a great product,
but you also have skill,
and Doug has four offers
for his butter spray company
Biem.
I've seen this before
when two or three Sharks
have offers
Yeah, what I'm trying
to figure out, Doug,
is what you truly value.
Right.
Because you got,
What I heard Doug say
is he wants to do a deal
with Mark Cuban.
John: Doug, you see
what I kind of predicted
that was gonna happen?
Congratulations, Doug.
Great job.
Appreciate it.
See you in Austin.
Thanks.
I guess.
Foreman:
I feel great about about
having the deal with Lori.
She's right up my alley
His Lemonade Doughnut
smells really good, too.
Lemonade Doughnuts.
