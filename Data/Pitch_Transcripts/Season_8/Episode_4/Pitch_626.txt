Hi, I'm Madison,
and I'm 12.
Hi, I'm Mallory,
and I'm 10.
Hello,
I'm their mom Viara.
We are seeking $55,000
in exchange for
20% of our company.
We created a body?care line
for tween and teen girls,
made by
tween and teen girls.
We have yummy scents
and funny names
like Watermelon Funk
and Frozen Hot Chocolate.
We believe that when you
smell good, you feel good.
I know that you'll like
our body sprays.
And I know that
you'll like our lotions.

Wow!
[ Laughs ]
? Got everybody talkin' ?
? My sister right beside me ?
? Smells Frozen Hot Chocolate ?
? No lie, no lie ?
? It's online, it's online ?
? So go buy, go buy ?
? Angels and Tomboys ?
All: All girls are created
equally different.
Greiner: Yay.
Herjavec:
Yeah! Great job.
Now, we have samples
for you to enjoy.
[ Laughter ]
Let's smell it.
[ Laughs ]
Madison, you look so
different in the video.
[ Giggles ]
See,
we have Candy Star Glam.
Herjavec:
There you go, Lori.
Thank you.
You have Candy Star Glam
body spray,
and you have Frozen Hot
Chocolate body spray.
Herjavec: Oh, okay.
O'Leary: Thank you.
Madison: You have
Lemonade Doughnuts.
Greiner: Mm.
Thanks.
You have
Watermelon Funk.
Thank you.
But of course.
O'Leary:
Let me try yours, Lori.
It smells very good.
Thank you.
O'Leary: Let me try yours.
Madison: Hope you enjoy.
So, ladies,
this is the product line.
It's a body spray
for kids.
Right now, there's body sprays
and body lotions
to kind of introduce the brand
to the marketplace.
However, it is our goal
later on down the line
to have a full?fledged
personal hygiene company.
How much
do you sell it for?
We sell it for $12.
That seems like a lot to me.
Is that a lot?
You think about the ingredients
that are involved,
Viara: They're ?? they're
all?natural ingredients.
I like that.
So, they're made with vitamins
A, C, and E,
the whole paraben?free,
vegan?friendly concept, so...
What is cost you to make,
and how do you sell it?
Cost to make?
Mallory: $4.
And how do you sell it?
We sell online
and at trade shows.
They sell at trade shows?
How many have you sold?
If you sell at trade shows,
you sell ??
We ?? We sell 5,000.
So, have you sold
$5,000 worth, or ?? or ??
No, we sell 5,000 units.
We've sold $59,000 worth.
Yeah! That's good.
Wow.
Viara: Yes, absolutely.
Greiner: $59,000?
So you guys are
making money then.
Wait, wait, wait, Kevin.
You guys are profitable,
then, right?
Uh, we're not as profitable
as we can be.
So how are you acquiring
customers online?
How would anybody
know about you right now?
We are word of mouth.
We are social media,
all day long,
every day pushing
the brand online.
And we did
a lot of street footwork,
guerrilla marketing.
The girls were even
taking product to schools
in their backpack
and selling it.
Selling.
But what made you
even think of the idea?
Yeah, tell him what made
you think of it.
We ?? [ Laughs ]
We were always playing
with our mom's lotions,
but they all are...
[ Laughs ]
Both:
Too flowery, too strong,
or too expensive.
[ Laughs ]
And, like, we just kind of
wanted our own thing.
Like, literally,
there's nothing out there ??
Either Victoria's Secret ??
like what little girl our age
feels comfortable
going into Victoria's Secret?
Especially the parents ??
uncomfortable.
It's okay,
but it's not really for us.
It's an interesting
demographic.
You're talking about kids
that are sort of 5 to 11,
is that it?
12, uh?huh.
Okay, so that's
the target market?
5 to 12.
Where, exactly,
would you put that?
What retailer
would you optimize in?
Target would be ??
How big can this be?
What ?? Like,
what's equivalent product?
Well, there isn't one,
to be honest with you.
However, this is
a trillion?dollar market.
You're talking about ??
Trillion?
Are you familiar with, like,
the girls product line
with lip glosses,
the body sprays,
the lotions, the perfumes?
Little girls
want to smell good,
I mean, all day, everyday.
The girls are using it up.
They run through like water.
So, listen,
your scents are very good.
They smell great.
Thank you.
I wear a perfume that's actually
called "Sugar" sometimes.
Or "Chocolate."
People are like,
"What are you wearing?
I love that smell."
I'm like,
"It's 'Chocolate'"
But, you know what,
chocolate smells good.
Absolutely.
So, um...
Thank you.
Greiner: I think ??
[ Laughs ]
Oh, my.
Oh.
I was thinking out loud.
Sorry.
I'm speechless.
I love it.
The question is,
isn't there in drugs stores
and in Target
and that, like, sweet smelling,
fun little bottles of scents
for girls?
We've gone to the stores.
We've done the research.
We've been online.
But, this ??
But isn't that ??
But there's not just
lip balm.
We haven't got ??
But what about lotions?
Why wouldn't, in ??
in the fragrance category,
which is very high?margin
business ??
If they thought there
was a real category for
5 to 12 year olds,
they would populate it
with products.
They just
haven't done it.
O'Leary: I know, but ??
I mean,
but, everybody ??
Yeah, yeah, no.
Somebody's got to be first!
Everybody has to create
something.
Somebody has to do it,
and we're doing it.
We have done it.
So, I mean,
the risk for an investor,
any investor, any Shark, is
maybe the reason
they haven't done it
is 'cause
there's no market.
Maybe they haven't
done it,
'cause they haven't thought of it.
No, that's, like,
saying anything ??
Yeah. That's ??
I mean, honestly,
it's as simple as that.
I want to talk
to Madison and Mallory.
Do you guys love
doing this?
Yes, very much.
Love.
Are you into it?
Like, are you having fun
running the business?
Yes.
Yes.
Tell me about
what you guys do.
So much so
you're gonna quit school?
[ Laughs ]
No. Education
is still important.
Where are you making
the product?
At home.
Oh, you're packaging
it at your kitchen
table, literally.
Yes.
Wow.
Who was the genius
that created
the "All girls are created
equally different"?
Ah!
Cuban: Ta?da!
You?
Every ?? Every ??
Good girls.
It's a very smart
branding statement.
That's a great line.
And where did
the name come from?
Um, well,
I'm sort of the angel.
Angel.
And she's the tomboy.
Tomboy.
[ Laughs ]
Aww.
Madison: Yeah.
O'Leary:
So, if you got a retail order
for 100,000 units,
who would make it?
You can't do that
on your kitchen table.
Well, I've already
spoken to manufacturers,
and they've ??
And you've gone over
the numbers
on how much
they would actually ??
Right, so it wouldn't cost us
$4 if we had a manufacturer.
We'd be looking closer
to $1.75.
Herjavec: Viara let me ??
Let me start it.
I ?? I'm just struggling
with seeing a market for this
for girls between 5 to 12.
I'm not saying
there isn't one,
but, you know, I sit here,
I have to make a decision.
I don't see it. Like,
I wouldn't buy that for my kids.
I'm not saying
it's a bad product.
I ?? I just don't see it.
I'm out. Thank you.
Viara: Thank you.
It's really intriguing,
'cause I don't think
this category exists.
That's the big risk,
I mean ??
No,
that's the big upside.
Well,
it's not that easy a task.
I'm just, you know ??
You girls should understand
the world's tough out there.
This is not
gonna be easy.
And I ?? I ??
You know, I'm just wondering
is it something
you have to create?
That's the ??
People are buying it,
though.
That's the difference.
We put it in front of people,
they buy it.
I don't think
you've proven that yet.
That it can be sold?
Yeah.
It's absolutely a market.
I don't know,
I'm ?? I'm looking at it
pragmatically ??
I'm looking at
it pragmatically.
And you're looking at moms
and dads that buy.
I'm just saying,
you know, for me
the amount of work
that's gonna be required here
to get it into retail,
which is where it should sell,
too much risk for me.
I'm out.
Okay.
Sorry, ladies.
Well, first of all,
your song and dance
were great.
Herjavec:
The dancing was awesome.
You guys are
really super stars.
It's a very scary thing
to come into the Shark Tank,
and, really, the most
beautiful thing you're wearing
is your confidence.
Thank you.
I know how hard a path it is
with a fragrance.
I've already been in
the business with fragrances.
It was very tough.
A lot of celebrities
come out with fragrances.
They also have ??
have not succeeded.
So, I'm out,
but you've done
a good job so far.
Thank you.
You know, I'm, um...
So, um ??
It's tough, because...
What are you struggling with,
Daymond?
I'm struggling with ??
Well, a couple of things,
you know?
You're torn.
I can see it.
Yeah, often people giving up
at this early stage ??
You're contorting yourself
to take a hobby
and call it a business.
That's really
what's going on.
Yeah, but their ??
Their hobby followed
the same exact path
as my hobby followed.
I got it.
So you got to ??
You know, my hobby ??
I went around to the trade shows
and sold shirts
and kept selling
and kept selling, kept selling.
Well, just be honest with them.
and tell them what it is.
It's a hobby.
Would it have been better
or worse for you, Daymond,
if someone
had given you a deal?
Absolutely.
Or you do you think you're
better off that nobody did?
No, don't say that.
[ Exhales sharply ]
My biggest challenge
is the fact that
after this is on somebody,
you can't see it.
You have to market it
dollar by dollar
and/or exposure P. R..
Mark and I were talking here,
and I was asking him,
you know,
if we can do an offer together,
because he has a history here
with Simple Sugars.
So, I think
if Mark is down with me,
uh, and we can
make an offer.
Uh...
Right now you're asking
$55,000 for 20%.
Viara:
Oh, wow. Oh, wow!
[ Laughter ]
You're awful!
You need a little work,
Daymond.
All right, thank you.
Cuban: Good job, guys.
Thank you.
We appreciate it.
Thank you so much.
Congrats, guys.
[ Snapping fingers ]
Mallory: Hey!
