Hi, I'm Madison,
and I'm 12.
Hi, I'm Mallory,
and I'm 10.
Hello,
I'm their mom Viara.
We are seeking $55,000
in exchange for
20% of our company.
Madison, you look so
different in the video.

Madison: You have
Lemonade Doughnuts.
Greiner: Mm.
Thanks.
You have
Watermelon Funk.
Thank you.
But of course.
O'Leary:
Let me try yours, Lori.
It smells very good.
Thank you.
O'Leary: Let me try yours.
Madison: Hope you enjoy.
So, ladies,
this is the product line.
It's a body spray
for kids.
Viara: They're ?? they're
all?natural ingredients.
Cost to make?
Mallory: $4.
Viara: Yes, absolutely.
Greiner: $59,000?
So you guys are
making money then.
Wait, wait, wait, Kevin.
You guys are profitable,
then, right?
Uh, we're not as profitable
as we can be.
So how are you acquiring
customers online?
How would anybody
know about you right now?
We are word of mouth.
We are social media,
all day long,
I want to talk
to Madison and Mallory.
Do you guys love
doing this?
Yes, very much.
Love.
Are you into it?
Like, are you having fun
running the business?
Yes.
Yes.
Tell me about
what you guys do.
So much so
you're gonna quit school?
[ Laughs ]
No. Education
is still important.
Where are you making
the product?
At home.
Oh, you're packaging
it at your kitchen
table, literally.
Yes.
Wow.
Who was the genius
that created
the "All girls are created
equally different"?
Ah!
Cuban: Ta?da!
You?
Every ?? Every ??
Good girls.
Madison: Yeah.
O'Leary:
So, if you got a retail order
for 100,000 units,
who would make it?
You can't do that
on your kitchen table.
Well, I've already
spoken to manufacturers,
Herjavec: Viara let me ??
Let me start it.
I ?? I'm just struggling
with seeing a market for this
for girls between 5 to 12.
I'm not saying
there isn't one,
but, you know, I sit here,
I have to make a decision.
I don't see it. Like,
I wouldn't buy that for my kids.
I'm not saying
it's a bad product.
I ?? I just don't see it.
I'm out. Thank you.
Viara: Thank you.
It's really intriguing,
'cause I don't think
this category exists.
That's the big risk,
I mean ??
No,
that's the big upside.
Well,
it's not that easy a task.
I'm just, you know ??
Viara:
Oh, wow. Oh, wow!
[ Laughter ]
You're awful!
You need a little work,
Daymond.
All right, thank you.
Cuban: Good job, guys.
Thank you.
We appreciate it.
Thank you so much.
Congrats, guys.
