My name's Doug Foreman.
I'm from Austin, Texas.
I'm seeking $500,000
for 5% equity of my company.
Now, Sharks,
if you love cooking, eating,
and entertaining like I do,
then you probably love
using real butter.
But the problem with butter
is it's hard and cold.
It tears up toast,
or if you're cooking with it,
your burn it in the pan.
Melted butter
and pouring it popcorn ??
That's just a soggy mess.
Sharks, I'd like
to introduce to you
the first and only spray
that uses real butter
and goes from butter stick
to butter spray
in just a few seconds.
It's called Biem.
Just insert
a stick of butter,
and using just heat and air
without chemicals
or artificial ingredients,
you're ready to Biem.
You can Biem pans
for a healthier, tastier,
nonstick cooking spray.
You can Biem bread or rolls.
You can Biem corn on the cob
or popcorn.
Anything you can butter,
you can Biem.
So, which one of you
is ready to join us
and help us to make the world
a "butter" place.
[ Laughs ]
Herjavec: Yeah.
I've got some to show you.
Oh, you do?
Yeah.
And bring that popcorn
over.
I have to give Lori's hers,
'cause she's little.
Yes.
Thank you.
She can't reach it.
[ Laughs ]
Foreman: We actually have
a motion detector
so that as soon as
you lift it up,
it's gonna turn itself on
and start.
Oh, wow.
Greiner:
So, by lifting it...
Foreman: Right.
... the heat
starts to work.
Yes.
It melts the butter.
Right. And it ?? It only melts
the butter that you need.
Not ??
It doesn't keep melting.
This thing does
more than my car.
How did you come up
with this idea,
and give us a little bit
about your history.
Well, um ??
So I've been in the food
business most of my life.
I started a company in 1989
called Guiltless Gourmet.
It was the first
baked tortilla chip
in the United States.
Oh, I love those.
Thank you.
Yeah.
I sold that company.
You had a good exit?
Had a good exit.
Uh, got married, had kids,
and had an exit there, too.
Oh.
[ Laughter ]
What ?? What price point
are you gonna sell them at?
We sold those
at an average of $137.
Ow?che?wawa.
O'Leary: $137.
$137.
What did they cost you
to make?
Foreman:
Right now it's at $43,
but we're also, you know,
working it down.
Is it patented?
It's patent pending.
Yes, both utility
and design.
Utility?
What's the ??
what's the ??
Is there anybody else
that has melting spray?
No.
You must have a sense of
how large the market is
when you're saying
today it's worth $10 million.
Yeah.
What's your plan
to work your way
into that valuation?
The cooking spray market
right now in the United States
is about $375 million.
We plan to go direct to consumer
first online.
Online.
So, what do you think
in terms of numbers
in the next
three to five years?
We think that next year,
we can probably sell
100,000 units.
So, you're thinking
$10 million next year.
Yeah.
Doug, you're pretty savvy,
right?
Yeah.
You came in here, you ??
Wait, wait.
I want to hear the answer.
You probably know who you
want to be partners with.
Well, I want an answer,
too, which ?? I have
an offer on the table.
No, I want to know
if he's having issues
with it clogging, or ??
I think
all that's crap, Lori.
Lori,
I think all that is crap.
You're as real as it gets,
a proven entrepreneur.
You're coming back
to where you have experience,
you know how to get this stuff
out there,
and You got a potential
amazing partner right here
at 17.5%.
Yep.
I've got a lot of customers
in the wine business
and a ton in the food business
that I've sold all direct,
didn't use retail to do it.
I'm gonna make you an offer.
I'll do the $500,000
for 15%.
I'll undercut Daymond
a little bit,
primarily 'cause
I think I can sell it
directly to
my customer base now.
So, you're giving him
a $3.5 million value.
I ?? I think
that's worth it.
I'll match
Kevin O'Leary's offer.
So, Doug, I ?? I just have
a question around in the ??
Doug, you have two offers
on the table.
Herjavec: Is there a feature
from the product that
we can we take away
in a model
and come out at
a significantly
lower price point?
Probably the ??
the outer shell,
'cause we're using
stainless.
Greiner: You could have
a cheaper model,
and you could have
your higher?end luxury model.
Exactly.
Are you open
to that?
Yes.
Can it be
substantially less
if you did it
in a different material?
Yes.
All right, well, I'm gonna
tell you what I think.
Can I get an answer
to my offer?
I think
you hit my trifecta,
which is "Clever,"
"Unique,"
Foreman: Thank you.
I like that you have
a great product,
but you also have skill,
and you're an innovator,
and you're willing to work.
Yes.
So, I'm gonna
make you an offer.
I'm gonna offer you
$600,000...
for 20%.
and Doug has four offers
for his butter spray company
Biem.
I've seen this before
when two or three Sharks
have offers
and you're not
talking to them.
They start to disappear.
It's starts to get
really nasty,
and that's the last thing
you ever want to do
is not make somebody feel
like you're acknowledging ??
Daymond,
I appreciate your offer.
I absolutely do.
What do you think
of our offers?
Cuban:
Well, he's obviously ??
Look, he's obviously
valuing the company higher,
otherwise he would have
grabbed the offer.
He's not just ??
So, then say no. Counter.
Yeah, what I'm trying
to figure out, Doug,
is what you truly value.
Right.
Because you got,
you know,
20%, 15%, and 10%,
and you haven't jumped
or haven't countered
on any of that.
There has to be something,
because you have to assign
a value to us.
Obviously.
I mean, look,
there's a reason I'm here.
What is it that you're
actually looking for?
It's a big difference between
if I call a Williams?Sonoma,
or they call me.
But a Shark can call
Williams?Sonoma
and get you right in.
But I'm not gonna ??
I'm not gonna be that
Shark to do it,
because I'm starting
to be concerned about
how you would be
as a partner.
So, I'm gonna take my offer
off the table.
Whoa.
Sorry to hear that.
I like people
who are deceive.
Greiner: When you were
laying in bed last night,
what were you thinking
you wanted to have
happen here today?
To do a deal.
With?
You know, I know Mark,
you know, your background
and the companies
that you have, uh,
for ?? as far as infrastructure
and setting it up ??
e?commerce stuff that ??
It was something that
was very attractive to me.
I don't have that?
What I heard Doug say
is he wants to do a deal
with Mark Cuban.
I want to be a partnership.
I want to be in it with you.
And I ?? And I ??
And I do, too.
You want to do it with Mark.
I'm out.
John: Doug, you see
what I kind of predicted
that was gonna happen?
You better hurry up
and get to negotiating.
Well, I didn't hear Cuban.
Is he in or out?
What I see is
a product that's cool,
product that, more importantly,
you have complete confidence in,
but not every business
is a fit for me.
I just don't see it.
I'm out.
Thanks.
O'Leary: Well, this is
getting interesting.
You've got
two offers left.
Yes.
Yet you had a lot more interest
just a few minutes ago.
The real question is,
are you willing to part
with more than 5% equity
for any Shark?
Yes.
Okay.
So, the question is,
how much more than 5%?
Those offers multiplied.
You know,
I'd like to hear a counter.
Would you do ??
Would you match
Kevin's deal?
Would I match
were Kevin is at?
Of course.
Do you not want to do
a deal with Kevin?
You asked Lori
to match Kevin's offer.
Oh, I ?? I was ??
If you're willing
to take that offer,
why not just take
Kevin's offer?
Because there's a big difference
between me and Kevin.
Yeah.
I'll probably outsell her.
No.
Now, just for fun,
$500,000 for 14%.
[ Laughs ]
Congratulations, Doug.
Great job.
Appreciate it.
See you in Austin.
Thanks.
I guess.
Foreman:
I feel great about about
having the deal with Lori.
She's right up my alley
for how to get done at retail
and to sell a product.
And, you know, we're ??
We're gonna do great
things together.
God, please let us
all be okay.
Please let us walk away
with a great deal.
Please help us
be energetic.
Please help everybody
be nice.
And, God, please don't
let us mess up. Amen.
His Lemonade Doughnut
smells really good, too.
Lemonade Doughnuts.
