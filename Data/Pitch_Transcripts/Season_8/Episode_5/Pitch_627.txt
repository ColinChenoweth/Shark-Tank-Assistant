That's Mr. Wonderful, Scout.
Thank you so much.
Barbara.
Thank you so much.
What's your margin, Melissa,
on a typical shirt?
So, I sell
all kids' shirts for $22,
to play with the big guys,
because you want to pick off
one order at a time online,
which I'm not saying
is a bad business.
Yeah.
It's a cottage
hobby?like business.
Yeah, well, I ??
So, first of all,
I'm ?? I'm not
a hobby anymore.
I used to be.
Melissa, your sales
are nothing!
Melissa, that's the problem.
You have $67,000 in sales.
?Nothing.
You said in two years,
you did $340,000.
Melissa: Mm?hmm.
But you said since January,
you've done $67,000.
Mm?hmm.
That says
that sales are going down.
Your sales are down.
So, in 2015,
we did better
because we went viral
for that month.
But because ?? because
of Target taking your design...
But ??
Greiner: So, Melissa,
I'm gonna tell you something.
You know,
when I think about...
The minute ??
The minute she gives ??
The minute she gives
her offer, I'm out.
Melissa has one offer
on the table from Barbara
?Oh.
?Wait, Melissa.
?Come on.
?You know what she just said?
... in...
If you let her keep talking,
she's gonna go out.
No, no. I said the minute
she gives her offer,
but I also don't want
to hear the pitch.
Oh, no.
Now, that's nasty, Barbara...
It muddies the water.
...because you're trying
to lay it on me.
?It's the Shark Tank.
?I love it. I love it.
That's part of business,
making a decision.
She's trying to put
the blame on me.
If you walk out of here
without a deal, you're an idiot.
You know what's interesting?
Melissa, Kevin was out
a long time ago.
You said you were happy with it,
so our relationship is over.
Oh! I would love to hear
what Lori had to say.
But, Melissa, that's...
That's great logic.
We ?? We wish you
the best, Melissa.
Thank you.
?Good luck.
?Everybody's out.
?Thank you.
?Thank you.
Melissa: I came to "Shark Tank"
to get a deal with an investor
who believes in me
as an entrepreneur.
I didn't come here
to make a deal
to team up
with some other company.
I want who invests in me
to believe in me.
I thought that was jacked up,
because ??
What was jacked up?
Because I ??
One, I hadn't ??
I had not decided yet
what I wanted to do.
You put her on the clock.
Yeah, we do that.
It's what we do.
We're Sharks.
?Of course.
I wanted to talk to her ??
That's what we do.
I thought that you were
a good partner.
Look, at the end of the day,
she didn't accept the offer,
she didn't seize opportunity.
What they sell is, they have
a SiliDog display board ??
it's called
the SiliDog Starter Pack ??
as well as 12 SiliPasses,
