My name is Joshua Parker.
I'm 18 years old,
and I'm from Canton, New York.
Dad, can you pass the syrup?
I love everything
about maple syrup ??
the texture, the flavor,
the process it takes to make it,
and everything
that you can do with it.
It's just
a great natural product.
I discovered my passion
for maple syrup
when I was 11 years old.
I was captivated by the idea
that I could go to my own
backyard, tap the trees,
and make
my own delicious maple syrup.
When I was 15,
I decided I wanted
to turn it into a real business.
I knew that that meant
more equipment and more money,
and so, I was fortunate enough
that my dad was willing
to cosign a bank loan
and lend me $70,000
of his own money.
If you don't know your numbers,
you will not know your business.
I've reached a point
where I'm getting interest
from big retailers,
and I need a Shark's investment
to help me take that next step.
I've chosen to take this path.
All of my friends
have gone to college.
I've chosen to run
a maple syrup business.
Everything in my future
is dependent on this working.
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Joshua Parker.
I'm from Canton, New York.
My company is Parker Maple,
and I'm seeking $200,000
for a 20% stake in my company.
When I was 11 years old,
I went on a school field trip
to learn
how maple syrup is made.
Where I expected to find
a fun afternoon,
I found something else entirely.
I found a passion
for making maple syrup.
Four years later,
I decided to turn my passion
into a real business,
and today, Parker Maple's
one of the fastest?growing
and most innovative maple syrup
companies in the country.
Parker Maple offers an entire
line of maple products,
from maple syrup
to maple cotton candy,
and today, I'm working
to successfully bring
a unique maple product
into the national space ??
maple butter...
a delicious, creamy,
and natural spread
perfect for toast,
to icing fruit,
and just about anything else.
Sharks, I've proven that
the American dream is not dead,
that people in my generation
can succeed.
We will be America's brand
for real maple.
I want to give you some
to sample.
Good job.
?Good pitch.
?Oh, yeah, great.
Let me give ?? Lori, I'll
get ?? I'll get it for you.
?Thank you.
?Thank you, my friend.
Maple cotton candy.
Now, that's a first.
Thank you.
And I am
a cotton candy lover.
Thank you so much, Joshua.
?Thanks, Josh.
?Thank you.
Tell us
what we're eating here.
This is
the, uh, maple butter here?
Yes.
So, the maple butter
is on the English muffin.
Oh, that's good.
?Oh, wow.
?Oh, my God.
?I love it.
?The spread is really good.
Thank you very much.
That is really good.
Cotton candy
is out of this world.
Joshua, how old are you?
I'm 18.
?You're 18?
?Okay, well, congratulations.
18.
You've come
to the right place, Joshua,
and I'm gonna tell you a little
story you're gonna appreciate.
Okay.
Before I was known
as Mr. Wonderful...
[ Laughter ]
He made maple syrup.
...I lived
and went to school
right on the border
of Vermont and Quebec.
Oh, really?
It was a military college.
I became a marksman there,
but I was also known
as Maple Man...
Really?
... because I love
maple syrup.
[ Laughter ]
No question about it.
Just when we think
he can't do one more thing.
Maple Man ??
?On Saturdays ??
?Oh, my God!
On Saturdays, I used to
get a part?time job
making maple syrup.
I've learned
the whole process.
I know how to tap the tree,
boil the maple syrup,
all of that.
I think
this is really interesting.
Tell me more about your sales.
Maple Man wants to know.
To date, we've done
just about $360,000 in sales
since the beginning
of the company.
Well, how about this year?
By the year's end, we'll break
$1.5 million in sales.
?Wow.
?Wow.
?Yes. Yes.
?May I interrupt you
to just ask you, what is
different about the maple syrup?
Because I taste it and
I don't see any difference.
Maple syrup in and of itself
is kind of a commodity product,
so it's really the brand
around that product.
You're just selling it
in a different format
than most people do.
Right, exactly.
So, the rollout
of the maple butter product ??
We just went under
an entire re?branding process.
I already got a $100,000 order
from Costco.
?Wow.
?Good for you.
You're still a long way off
from $1.5 million.
Which product? Which product?
Parker:
For the maple butter.
And what will that sell for?
For $11.99 retail.
What are your costs?
It costs me $8.46 per unit.
Wow.
Your margin's awful.
Very thin,
but that's a problem
with a high?quality
maple product.
Right.
It's expensive to make.
Yes.
Cuban: Who's help??
Who's helping you,
and ?? and how much money
have you borrowed?
Because, you know, you talk
about a product re?launch...
Yes.
... delivering
all this inventory ??
That's expensive.
My dad
has helped me tremendously
through this whole process
with getting loans,
securing lines of credit.
How much loan
do you have?
The total liabilities against
the company is $300,000.
Oh.
Oh.
But the assets that we have
are within $2,000 of that.
We have
the production equipment,
and then our inventory is about
$180,000 worth of inventory.
Wow.
And there's kind
of a backstory behind that.
Tell us.
I had been working on
getting a purchase order
from this one retailer.
A large substantial
$125,000 purchase order.
I thought ??
I was very confident
that it was gonna come through.
I talked to them, and so I made
the decision to buy the syrup,
and the purchase order
never came through.
It never came through?
It's never over till
their check clears your bank.
Right.
It really kind of brought me
to a ?? a seriously low point
in the company and for me.
But instead
of kind of falling back
and just trying
to sell the syrup,
that's when I made the decision,
"Okay, we're gonna double down.
We're gonna re?brand.
I'm gonna pursue
this opportunity
that I have
with the big?box stores."
Can I return
to the spectacular figure ??
$1.5 million in sales
by year end?
Yes.
I wasn't quite sure
I was clear
as to how
you were gonna get there.
That's based on getting into
75 to 100 clubs with Costco.
But you don't have
those orders or commitments.
Yes?
Right.
So that's a projection
based on optimism.
Right. Yes.
I've sold product into Costco,
but I don't find
that they order the
additional stores so quickly.
Right.
They really want
to see how well it does.
I think it's gonna take you
a number of years.
I think you're optimistic
about what your sales
are going to be.
I just don't think you're
gonna make the kind of money,
and I don't think I'd get
my money back out, so I'm out.
I'm not Mr. Maple Man,
but I will give you
one piece of advice.
Yes.
This is only 114 calories.
Yes.
Whenever you have
something this big
that tastes this good...
It's only 114 calories?
Wow.
?Yeah, it's sugar.
?... that only has 114 calories,
you should say across
the whole thing...
Wow.
Yes.
..."Only 114 calories."
?Yeah.
?How much does it cost?
72 cents.
And what do you sell it for?
$1.50.
No, you're selling it
for $2.99 now.
Okay.
This will be your best seller,
but in order
to be investable,
you're gonna have to scale
to enormous size,
and I just don't see you
doing that right now.
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
You're welcome.
Herjavec: Joshua, you're ??
you're an amazing kid.
I got to tell you ??
When I was 18 years old,
I certainly wasn't running
a business.
The work you've done
over the last three years,
it's incredible.
You remind me
of a young Kevin O'Leary.
[ Laughter ]
Maple Man!
The young Maple Man.
I think your forecast
is really optimistic.
Based on your own story,
I don't know
if it's gonna happen, but...
you've got
a long way to go.
Just not a space
that I want to be in right now.
I'm out.
Thank you.
You are a dynamo.
You are going to make things
happen no matter what happens.
I love your product,
but I don't see it
as an investment for me
because your margins
are so very low.
Right.
For that reason, I'm out,
but... I can see you making it.
Thank you.
And so, Josh, the moon slowly
set over the maple forest.
And there were ?? And there were
only two people left.
There was Josh,
the handsome entrepreneur...
No way.
... and Maple Man.
Maple Man,
what are you gonna do?
Okay, so, yes, it's true ??
I'm Maple Man,
and I know
this business pretty well.
The problem here, Josh,
is $200,000 for 20%
imputes
a $1 million valuation,
but you're not actually
profitable yet.
So, for any investor,
I wouldn't do this for 20%.
It would be
a huge amount of equity,
and you're
a family business.
I don't see any way
to ?? to do a deal
that's gonna make sense and be
of benefit to both of us.
Maple Man is out.
?Josh, thank you very much.
?Thank you.
?Yes.
?Congrats, Josh. Good luck.
?Yeah, good luck.
?Nice job.
?We wish you all the best.
?Good luck, Josh.
?$2.99.
?Thank you.
Yes, absolutely.
Thank you.
Parker:
I think that in the Tank today,
I learned more
than a semester in college.
I'm gonna go home,
I'm gonna make the changes
that I think
that are right for the company,
and really take their advice.
But was he adorable, that kid.
Right?
Adorable.
This is
better than cotton candy.
It's amazing.
Put that cotton candy
in my trailer.
