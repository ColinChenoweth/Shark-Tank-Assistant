My name is Joshua Parker.
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Joshua Parker.
I'm from Canton, New York.
My company is Parker Maple,
Parker Maple offers an entire
line of maple products,
Thank you so much, Joshua.
?Thanks, Josh.
?Thank you.
Tell us
what we're eating here.
This is
the, uh, maple butter here?
Yes.
So, the maple butter
is on the English muffin.
Oh, that's good.
?Oh, wow.
?Oh, my God.
?I love it.
?The spread is really good.
Thank you very much.
That is really good.
Joshua, how old are you?
I'm 18.
?You're 18?
?Okay, well, congratulations.
18.
You've come
to the right place, Joshua,
Which product? Which product?
Parker:
For the maple butter.
Herjavec: Joshua, you're ??
you're an amazing kid.
I got to tell you ??
When I was 18 years old,
I certainly wasn't running
a business.
The work you've done
over the last three years,
it's incredible.
You remind me
of a young Kevin O'Leary.
[ Laughter ]
Maple Man!
The young Maple Man.
I think your forecast
is really optimistic.
Based on your own story,
I don't know
if it's gonna happen, but...
you've got
a long way to go.
Just not a space
that I want to be in right now.
I'm out.
Thank you.
You are a dynamo.
You are going to make things
happen no matter what happens.
I love your product,
but I don't see it
as an investment for me
because your margins
are so very low.
Right.
For that reason, I'm out,
but... I can see you making it.
Parker:
I think that in the Tank today,
I learned more
than a semester in college.
I'm gonna go home,
I'm gonna make the changes
that I think
that are right for the company,
