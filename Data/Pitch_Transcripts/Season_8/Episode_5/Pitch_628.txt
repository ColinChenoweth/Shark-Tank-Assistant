Hey, Sharks. I'm Melissa Lay
from Portland, Oregon.
This is Scout and Penny,
my girls.
I'm asking for $100,000
in exchange for 10% equity
in my company,
SandiLake Clothing.
We are a modern
and unique clothing brand
designed by a mom,
inspired by littles,
and made for the whole family.
When I became a mom, I had
a huge shopping problem.
All I could find
for my girls to wear
were pink, princess,
sparkly?covered items.
For boys, the options are
blue, trucks, and superheroes.
I decided if I couldn't buy
the clothes I wanted,
I would just make them.
We have created tops,
hats, and leggings
that are unisex and relevant
with today's trends.
Each item...
Mom.
...is designed and handmade
by me.
I'm a mom. That's how it is.
?Yeah.
Melissa: Each item is designed
and handmade by me,
giving each customer a custom,
unique, made?as?ordered product.
But, Sharks, I need your help
to take us to the next level.
Join with me in creating
the next big name in fashion ??
SandiLake Clothing.
Girls, do you want
to go give them their gifts?
?Yeah.
?They're right back there.
?Yes.
?No, other side.
Right back here.
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
Go get them. You can do it.
Go get the bags.
This is like every day
at my house.
They are adorable.
Over there.
Go give it to them.
Thank you very much.
Give one to Lori.
Thank you.
That's Mr. Wonderful, Scout.
Thank you so much.
Barbara.
Thank you so much.
?And Mark.
?Thanks, Penny.
Give me a high five.
Ooh!
?Yeah, girls!
Okay, come here.
?"Be wild."
Good job, guys.
Go see Daddy, okay?
Good job.
Love you.
Go see Daddy.
That's cute.
Go ahead.
Greiner: "Yo, I'm 2."
Do you dream up these
little slogans on your own?
Yeah, so,
the matching one for that one
is "I need vacay."
Oh!
So, we kind of try to go
with whatever is, you know,
popular and trending.
That's great.
"Rad dad" is the top seller.
Absolutely.
Yeah, so...
What kind of sales do you
have over what period and how?
So, we've been open
for two years,
and we've sold $340,000,
and ??
?$340,000?
?Yes.
How much have you sold
since January?
Since January,
we're at $67,000.
And where do you
make all of the clothing?
Previously,
when we first started,
I created my own factory
in my home,
and just recently,
we opened a Portland ??
or built a relationship
with Portland Garment Factory.
What's your margin, Melissa,
on a typical shirt?
So, I sell
all kids' shirts for $22,
and it's $5.50
to make it right now.
Something really special
and unique about our company
is that, a year ago, we
actually went full?blown viral,
and this shirt
that I'm wearing
was found in Target
by one of my friends.
So I went
to my local Portland Target,
and sure enough,
there was a whole line of them,
and it was same tank top,
white print, same design.
Someone knocked you off?
Yes.
So I took the photo, and I
posted it to all my followers.
They started re?posting
and sharing,
and within hours, we were viral,
and our sales skyrocketed.
So, what did Target do?
I did actually
contact Target,
and it was a third party
who made it,
and they bought it from them.
And they took it out
of their stores.
?They ??
?That's fantastic.
Good for them.
Good for Target.
It's a wonderful testimony
to the power of the little...
?Yeah, oh, totally.
?Wow.
?Good for them.
?Did you copyright your design?
I had not at the time.
We were so small,
and we still ??
So they really hadn't
broken any law at the time.
No.
You know, it's
a great lesson, though...
Yeah.
...in knowing that when you have
unique designs, copyright them.
It's not a lot of money
to do so.
Yes.
O'Leary: I've learned from this
that you're a good designer,
but you don't have
the infrastructure
to play with the big guys,
because you want to pick off
one order at a time online,
which I'm not saying
is a bad business.
Yeah.
It's a cottage
hobby?like business.
Yeah, well, I ??
So, first of all,
I'm ?? I'm not
a hobby anymore.
I used to be.
Melissa, your sales
are nothing!
Melissa, that's the problem.
You have $67,000 in sales.
?Nothing.
You said in two years,
you did $340,000.
Melissa: Mm?hmm.
But you said since January,
you've done $67,000.
Mm?hmm.
That says
that sales are going down.
Your sales are down.
So, in 2015,
we did better
because we went viral
for that month.
But because ?? because
of Target taking your design...
But ??
... and making it famous,
you had a hit.
But I would love to see my shirt
go forward and be at Target.
You were a star,
and now you're fading.
I fully get...
[ Laughs ]
He's saying
you're a one?hit wonder.
I'm still a star, Kevin!
To me, it's just SandiLake ??
small everything,
including sales.
I'm out.
That's all right.
[ Laughter ]
What I want to know
is how you're marketing.
You had your viral hit,
but that's still
not enough typically.
So, what else are you doing to
drive traffic for your sales?
Yeah.
Yeah, so, we've just met with a
few people to start re?targeting
and getting people
to follow our products
as they're roaming the Web...
Right.
...'cause, you know, moms
all look at the same thing
all the time.
But that's tough, right,
because unless you're adding
a whole lot of new followers
on social media
every day or week...
Yeah.
...you're just pitching the same
people over and over again,
and they ?? they
get pitch fatigue.
Yeah.
It's going to be tough.
Okay.
Because of those challenges,
I'm out.
Okay, thank you.
There's no doubt
you're a great designer.
But here's what
the Target story tells me.
Your sales spiked,
but, you know,
once people forgot the story,
your sales actually declined.
That tells me
it's not doing it on its own.
You haven't figured out
how I'm gonna make money
from it today.
I'm out.
Okay, thank you.
Corcoran:
I have a different read
on what happened
with Target.
I say that's a lucky charm.
It's your first sign
that you're on a track
to something bigger.
Thank you.
And I really,
really believe in that.
Thank you.
I wanted to make an offer.
Oh, wow.
But I need to take
40% of the business.
And there's one contingency.
Okay.
On that 40%,
I want to sell half of that
to Grace &amp; Lace
so you'd actually...
Oh.
Without knowing them, they
have over $8 million in sales
after three years.
Pretty remarkable.
Yeah.
But I'll tell you something ??
She does it all on social media.
She's a genius at marketing.
Yeah.
It's a new world.
If you just shadow her,
you're gonna explode
your business.
But I'd like an answer
right now.
The only thing
that's hard for me is ??
I know the company
that you're talking about.
Mm?hmm.
And I know their style,
and it's a li??
It's different than what I am.
Oh, no, no, no. That's ??
I mean, in fact, it's something
I would never wear myself.
Let me tell you something.
They wouldn't have anything
to do with your design.
You're the designer here just
as she's the designer there.
This is to learn
the back?end operation,
the manufacturing,
the marketing,
the online marketing, okay?
Mm?hmm.
That's what
they're great at.
Listen, the 20% gives them
the ?? the incentive to do this.
I would love ??
Greiner: So, Melissa,
I'm gonna tell you something.
You know,
when I think about...
The minute ??
The minute she gives ??
The minute she gives
her offer, I'm out.
Melissa has one offer
on the table from Barbara
for her kids' clothing line,
SandiLake,
but she must make a decision now
before hearing out Lori.
Greiner:
When I think about...
The minute she gives ??
The minute she gives
her offer, I'm out.
?When I think about...
?Oh.
Wait, wait, wait.
This is really interesting.
...things that have
happened to people...
?Oh.
?Wait, Melissa.
?Come on.
?You know what she just said?
... in...
If you let her keep talking,
she's gonna go out.
No, no. I said the minute
she gives her offer,
but I also don't want
to hear the pitch.
Oh, no.
Now, that's nasty, Barbara...
It muddies the water.
...because you're trying
to lay it on me.
?It's the Shark Tank.
?I love it. I love it.
That's part of business,
making a decision.
She's trying to put
the blame on me.
If you walk out of here
without a deal, you're an idiot.
You know what's interesting?
Melissa, take a moment
of silence and think about it.
I ruin it for her.
You're welcome to move on
to Lori and away from me.
You get that?
But think about it
and say yes or no to me.
Barbara, I love your offer,
but I would like to hear
what Kevin and Lori have to say.
Kevin's out.
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.
Melissa, Kevin was out
a long time ago.
You said you were happy with it,
so our relationship is over.
Oh! I would love to hear
what Lori had to say.
And I do ??
?I'm out.
?Oh!
?Aah!
?Oh!
?Wow.
Oh!
Lori, you better
make it good.
Wow.
Now, here's what I will share,
what I was going to say...
Oh!
which, Barbara,
I like you, I respect you.
But before I even said
if I'm giving an offer
or not giving an offer,
then she went out,
so now it's all on my shoulders
how you lost a deal
or didn't lose a deal.
That's the way it goes.
This is the Shark Tank.
These kinds of situations
because...
You ?? You know what?
It's your fault.
You wouldn't make a decision.
I?I know.
Corcoran:
Lori, I wouldn't have done it
if you hadn't kept butting in
as I was talking.
I respect my fellow Sharks,
I respect Barbara,
but, Barbara ??
Butting in.
...I don't think
you need an offer from me.
Wow.
What would be great
is for you
to keep growing this
slowly...
Oh.
Wow.
...building
and building it,
and I don't want to be
in this business.
I'm sorry.
I'm out.
But I think
you're going to be great.
Thank you.
And you can do it,
and you can do it
your way.
The lesson is, you should have
taken that phenomenal offer
when you had a chance.
Instead, you squandered
your opportunity.
Great offer.
Now you're paying
a horrible price.
It's terrible.
This is a classic case, which
happens in business every day,
of curiosity killed the cat.
For me, though,
it was the deal.
It was that I would be teaming
up with another company,
and I want to work with ??
That's a great ?? great logic.
Then ?? Then that's fine.
But, Melissa, that's...
That's great logic.
And I want to work with
an investor who wants me...
But that's your confidence.
my product for me.
We ?? We wish you
the best, Melissa.
Thank you.
?Good luck.
?Everybody's out.
?Thank you.
?Thank you.
And you have two beautiful
children. Congratulations.
?Thank you.
?Definitely.
Melissa: I came to "Shark Tank"
to get a deal with an investor
who believes in me
as an entrepreneur.
I didn't come here
to make a deal
to team up
with some other company.
I want who invests in me
to believe in me.
I thought that was jacked up,
because ??
What was jacked up?
Because I ??
One, I hadn't ??
I had not decided yet
what I wanted to do.
You put her on the clock.
Yeah, we do that.
It's what we do.
We're Sharks.
?Of course.
I wanted to talk to her ??
That's what we do.
I thought that you were
a good partner.
Look, at the end of the day,
she didn't accept the offer,
she didn't seize opportunity.
And we can talk all we want.
She left without a deal.
You can't come in here
not knowing your numbers!
This is the Shark Tank.
We're gonna kill you.
People ask me all the time,
"Why are you so mean
on 'Shark Tank'?"
I'm not mean.
I'm just telling the truth
through the experiences
I've lived.
I was born
into a working?class family.
I struggled
like everybody else did.
My mother was from Lebanese
descent, my father was Irish.
He was a salesman.
He sold winter clothing
for children.
I was about 7 years old
when my father died.
Those were very tough years
for me.
My dad died
when he was 37 years old,
leaving my mother alone
with two children
and a very uncertain future
ahead.
Life being what it is,
changes all the time,
my mother
met a fellow named George.
The two of them married,
and life changed dramatically.
My stepdad joined the ILO, a
division of the United Nations.
We lived everywhere.
We moved to Cambodia, Cyprus,
Tunisia, Japan,
France, Switzerland.
Every two years,
a different country.
Looking back at all the unique
cultures I've been steeped in,
you understand everybody's
challenges in the world,
not just your own.
My stepdad's
a very pragmatic individual.
He tells it like it is.
I think I learned that trait
from him.
When I got out of college,
I wanted to be a photographer
and a rock star,
and I tried being a hippie
for a few years.
My stepfather said to me,
"You're gonna starve to death.
You should go back to school
right now."
When I graduated,
I started my first company,
Special Event Television.
It made sports programming
for the networks.
Then SoftKey
started in my basement,
which eventually became
The Learning Company.
And a few years later,
I sold it for $4.2 billion.
Exactly.
If you guys
loved it so much,
how come not a dime
from any of you?
A lot of people see me as
the harsh guy on "Shark Tank."
It's so not true.
Would you rather
have me lie to you
because I'm worried
about your feelings?
A Shark that is disingenuous,
that tries
to keep you feeling good
when they know
your idea has no merit
is doing you a huge disservice.
Today I'm really proud
to be an entrepreneur
and to help entrepreneurs
so they can create jobs.
There's nothing more noble
in America than doing that.
You don't start a business
out of greed
or the pursuit of money.
You do it
for the pursuit of freedom.
But I realized
in the early years
I didn't have a lot of time
for my young kids.
I was so busy with my business.
So now I try and spend
as much time as I can with them.
Everything you see
around you here, I made myself.
I worked like hell for it, and
I'm not embarrassed about it.
I'm proud to be a capitalist.
If I could go back in time
and speak to my dad, I'd say,
"Look, you taught me a lot
that's really helped me,
and just look
at our family today."
[ Breathes deeply ]
[ Sobs ]
[ Voice breaking ]
It always cracks me up.
He'd be really proud
of what I've achieved.
You know what's amazing?
Is I'm living my entire journey
all over again
through the companies
I'm funding.
The journey is so remarkable.
What they sell is, they have
a SiliDog display board ??
it's called
the SiliDog Starter Pack ??
as well as 12 SiliPasses,
and the SiliPasses work
as a ?? as a gift card
where there's
ordering instructions
and a unique scratch?off code
on the back.
O'Leary: But you're ??
But how do you pay back
the retailer for their space?
Do they get margins?
So, they pay me up front.
Okay.
I ?? In order to sell
with SiliDog, you get ??
It's $100.
So, I get that money up front.
And we also give them
exclusive access
to sell on the store's computer
right there.
You know what you want
on the tag,
you know which tag you want,
the store can enter it
in the computer,
and we get it like that.
Really?
And does the customer pay
then at the point of order,
or do they wait until
the merchandise comes?
They pay
right there in the store.
In advance?
In advance.
Cuban: What do you sell it
to the retailers?
$8.99.
$8.99.
Can you tell us
about your background?
So, my background ??
I'm 24 years old.
I went
to the University of Florida,
I studied accounting
and business,
and I got my master's there,
as well.
I've only been out of school
for about a year and a half.
Corcoran: I thought
you were 12 years old.
It's just the voice
and the baby face.
Don't let it fool you.
No, you have
such a youthful air.
What's your competition
out there?
How many other tags
are there that are not metal?
Every dog tag.
There are no other tags on the
market doing anything like this.
Yeah, but you can
customize the tag.
Are there any
that are not metal?
