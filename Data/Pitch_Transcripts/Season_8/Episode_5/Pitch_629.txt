Hi, Sharks.
My name is Cyndi.
I'm asking for $75,000
for 10% of my company.
But for today's special,
I'm willing to give 12%
just for you guys.
So, have you ever
burned your fingers
trying to get a hot dish
out of the microwave?
Well, fear no more,
because the SafeGrabs
will solve that problem
and much, much more.
Let me show you
how this simple silicone mat
will change your kitchen
forever.
You simply put it
on the turntable.
Grab the bowl of soup.
Microwave as usual,
and when it's done ??
beep, beep, beep ??
you basically grab it
from the bottom
without burning your fingers.
And when you get
to your destination,
not only is it your trivet,
but it's also your place mat.
Is this brilliant or what?
[ Laughter ]
But wait!
We all love
a multipurpose product,
so the SafeGrabs
becomes your food cover.
Jar opener, anyone?
It's such an easy twist.
[ Laughter ]
It's a pot grabber.
You have kids?
Use it as a plate, because
it is such an easy cleanup.
For the finale, a splatter guard
to keep your microwave clean.
So, Sharks, who would like
to invest in <i>these</i> silicones?
[ Laughter ]
I have samples for you.
Very clever.
Any one?
It's a set.
Thank you.
There you go, Lori.
Thank you very much.
Cyndi, I'm hiring you
for every product I have
that we need to put on TV.
I'm expensive.
[ Laughter ]
Corcoran:
I have a question.
What is the retail price
of this?
For the 10?inch,
it's $12.95,
and then for the 12?inch,
it's $14.95.
O'Leary:
Tell me about your margins.
$10.95 for the 10?inch ??
What's it cost to make it?
About land to here, the usual
estimate is about $2.75.
How do you sell them?
Right now, Amazon and boutiques
across the nation.
What are your sales?
Okay, I'm Asian, but numbers
get me dizzy, so hold on.
Okay, so...
[ Laughter ]
For the lifetime sales up to now
is $310,000.
Over what period of time,
Cyndi?
Three years,
but the first year,
my manufacturer
basically screwed up,
so I didn't really do
a lot of sales.
What have you done
in the last three months?
The la??
Year to date is $165,000.
$165,000.
Yes.
?Wow. Good for you.
?Cyndi, a couple questions.
Sure.
Aren't there other variations
of this product out there?
I feel like
I've seen things like this.
Yeah. I ??
No, there isn't.
Nothing else out there
that would protect my hand
from heat in a microwave?
Oh, there's a plastic one,
but it's big and bulky,
and it's, like,
Neanderthal?looking.
And it doesn't f??
bend, right?
It doesn't bend...
It ?? It's stiff, yeah.
...'cause it's plastic,
yes, yes.
Yeah.
O'Leary:
What's your patent on it?
It says, "Patent pending."
The way that it's shaped
and that I could grab it
in the microwave.
A couple ??
Cyndi, do you
make enough money
from the business today
that you do this full time?
Well, pathetically,
I live with my parents,
and they had no choice
because I didn't want to have ??
I didn't want
to incur more debt,
'cause you know how much
it costs to sustain a business.
Basically,
my first manufacturer,
they kind of screwed me over,
and I was down
to $11 in my bank account.
Wow.
So I got this full?time job
at a retail store,
and I would go into my car
during lunchtime
and do my business calls.
So, that's how
I supported myself,
and it was such a hard journey
because no one really
believed me in the beginning,
and even my parents
didn't believe me.
And for that reason,
it's so amazing
just to be standing here
in front of you guys,
'cause I watched your shows
from the beginning, episode one.
They say entrepreneurs
are the only ones
willing to work 80 hours
a week to avoid working 40.
But finally,
I think if we're on track,
I'll be finally out of debt
this year.
How much debt do you have?
Well, I just bought
new inventory.
How much inventory
do you have?
$50,000.
So you're basically
just almost breaking even.
Yes.
Are you breaking even?
I'm breaking even now.
Now.
Cuban: Cyndi, let me simplify
things for everybody.
Look, you're really
a product, not a company.
It's not really a fit
for me.
I'm out.
Thank you.
I'd like to cite what I do
in my kitchen,
because we all use
the microwave.
I always fold a towel,
and it sits in the microwave,
and after I bring
something to the counter,
I put the towel back on.
I just don't see
the vision on this one.
I'm out.
Okay, I think the challenge
is gonna be retail,
and to get this thing
into the $5 million
to $10 million
to $15 million range
where an investor like me
would make a decent return,
I think that's gonna be
pretty challenging,
'cause this product doesn't jump
off the shelf and sell itself.
You have to really
understand the merits of it.
Obviously
you've been successful
because when you
demonstrate it, it sells,
and I see why,
'cause you're ??
you're kind of perky
and frisky.
Probably great on TV.
I get it, but that's ??
?Frisky.
?Perky.
?You know, perky, frisky ?? TV.
?I'll take that as a compliment.
I mean, it's great.
And I think
this product will do well
as long
as <i>you</i> can demonstrate it,
'cause I think
you're good at it.
I'm out.
Cyndi, I love the product.
I think you've done
a great job with it.
Even more importantly,
you did a great job
presenting it today.
Thank you.
I love the different uses
of the product,
but I think as powerful
and good as the product is,
it's just not a business
that I see
that I understand or enjoy.
I'm out.
Lori,
what are you gonna do?
Greiner:
I really like your product.
I think
it has a lot of merit.
Great TV product, obviously.
I also think, though,
it's a great retail product.
Every season I say it ??
I make millionaires.
That's what I do.
So that's what I'd like
to do with you.
But to make you
a millionaire fast,
get you out of your parents'
home if you want to be...
Yes.
[ Laughs ]
I need a life.
...I am going to need 30%.
$75,000 for 30%,
'cause I know I'll get you
into Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.
I know
I'll get you into Target.
You're gonna need money
to be able
to fund all of that retail
happening really fast,
and I'm happy to help as needed
to fulfill purchase orders.
So, that's my offer.
You have an offer.
What are you gonna do?
Lori, can we go with 17%?
17%?
Because I'm not just starting
from the bottom.
I already know
how to do the manufacturing,
I know how to do the freight,
bringing it in, and...
You know, I'm gonna go back
to what I said to you,
because you're
a lone?man operation, right?
Yes.
Which is very hard.
I did it myself.
But a Shark
has tremendous value.
You know, there's just so much
that I bring to the table,
but it's also going
to take me time and effort.
So the lowest that I would go
is 25%.
O'Leary: Are you
gonna take that, Cyndi?
25% for $75,000?
Make a decision.
And become a millionaire.
[ Laughs ]
Would you consider 20%?
?You're over?negotiating.
?Be careful.
Greiner: Oh, look, I know
what I'm gonna do for you.
I know it.
All right, let's make a deal.
Good.
Whoo!
Whoo!
[ Laughs ]
Smart.
You can get
out of the house.
Oh!
To have a great partner
like Lori, are you kidding me?
I feel like I won the lotto!
I can finally go out
of my parents' home.
Let's go, let's go.
Come on.
Man: 4... 3... 2...
There's your mark, okay?
Roll doors.
Narrator: Next into the Tank is
what the entrepreneur believes
is a better version
of a must?have accessory.
