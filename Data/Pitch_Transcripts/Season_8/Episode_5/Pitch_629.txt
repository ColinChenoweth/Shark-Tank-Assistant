Hi, Sharks.
My name is Cyndi.
I'm asking for $75,000
for 10% of my company.
But for today's special,
I'm willing to give 12%
just for you guys.
So, have you ever
burned your fingers
trying to get a hot dish
out of the microwave?
Well, fear no more,
because the SafeGrabs
Cyndi, I'm hiring you
for every product I have
that we need to put on TV.
I'm expensive.

I have a question.
What is the retail price
of this?
For the 10?inch,
it's $12.95,
Over what period of time,
Cyndi?
Three years,
but the first year,
my manufacturer
basically screwed up,
so I didn't really do
a lot of sales.
What have you done
in the last three months?
The la??
Year to date is $165,000.

Cyndi, do you
make enough money
from the business today
that you do this full time?
Well, pathetically,
I live with my parents,
Cuban: Cyndi, let me simplify
things for everybody.
Look, you're really
a product, not a company.
It's not really a fit
for me.
I'm out.
Thank you.
I'd like to cite what I do
in my kitchen,
because we all use
the microwave.
Cyndi, I love the product.
I think you've done
a great job with it.
Even more importantly,
you did a great job
presenting it today.
Thank you.
I love the different uses
of the product,
O'Leary: Are you
gonna take that, Cyndi?
25% for $75,000?
Make a decision.
