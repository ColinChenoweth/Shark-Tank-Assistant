Hi, Sharks.
My name is Mikey Lickstein.
And this is
my co?founder, Bentley.
We're from Miami, Florida,
seeking $100,000
in exchange for 15% equity
in our company, SiliDog.
SiliDog has created
the new standard in pet tags.
We all love our pets,
but the sound
of the pet tags jingling...
[ Bell jingling ]
... is so annoying.
I've created a brilliant
yet simple solution.
I started SiliDog
while getting my master's degree
and fostering Bentley.
He was thrown from a car
on the highway.
A friend saved him,
and I took him in.
Aww.
His constant scratching
throughout the night
made his pet tags jingle,
and the color and engraving
on his tags kept fading.
After going through four tags
in one month,
I set out to create
the world's best pet tags.
Made out of 100% silicone,
SiliDog tags are silent, never
fade, and even glow in the dark.
We're seeking an investment
to help grow our company
and spread our message
that every dog is a SiliDog.
Now, who's ready to get Sili?
?Can we see it?
?Can we see samples?
Absolutely.
We have some sample for you.
So, we've labeled them each
for you.
We ?? We label it for the dog,
so as you can see...
Oh, thank you.
... made it out to your pet.
And Lori.
?Thank you.
Mr. Wonderful.
O'Leary: Thank you.
?Cute packaging.
?Thank you, sir.
And if you flip it over,
you'll see it's not for you.
It's for the dog.
?Oh.
?I like my tag. It's cute.
So, walk me through it,
Mikey.
I go online, and I say,
"My dog's name is Lola."
You can put anything
that you would like.
You go ?? go to our website,
you customize your tag,
pick it out, customize
the front, customize the back.
We make it and ship it to you
the next day.
How much do you charge me?
They sell for $19.99.
And how much is shipping?
Free shipping.
Free shipping.
From the day I order it,
how long
does it take till I get it?
?Three to five days.
?Oh, that's not bad.
Lickstein: We make it the next
day, if not the same day.
What does it cost
to make it?
Uh, it costs $2.99
delivered to the customer,
and we also just started
a wholesale strategy, as well,
selling in retail.
So, Mikey,
I had a dog tag,
and it had a metal tag
on a metal clasp,
and you're right ??
It drove me nuts.
So I went to the store
and bought a plastic dog tag.
What's the difference
between that and what you do?
The plastics are still noisy,
and at the same time,
they can still fade over time.
That's something
that drives me crazy,
'cause in the event
that you do have a lost dog,
you wouldn't be able
to read the information.
Where are your customers
coming from?
We attended one of the largest
pet?product trade shows
back in March,
and we got into over 90 stores.
We thought
we were only gonna get into 30,
and on the first day,
we got into over 60.
O'Leary: Michael, you have
such wide distribution.
You must have
fantastic sales.
What are they?
?[ Laughs ]
In ?? In 14 1/2 months,
we've done $142,000 in sales.
Oh, very good.
Good for you.
How do the stores
do the customization?
So, the stores
take zero inventory.
Well, hang on.
That's not true, Mikey.
No, that's ??
There's plastic tags.
Lickstein: Correct. Correct.
There's all kinds
of other tags.
How much did it cost you
to start this business?
I started this
with my own money.
I only invested $5,000
into it...
Cuban: Good for you.
... and that was the only
investment I've ever made.
?Good for you.
?I got to tell you ??
Where do you see your sales
going for the next year?
For the next year ??
That's why I'm here.
The sky's the limit.
It's gonna be endless.
We project this year ??
Conservatively, we're
gonna do $200,000 in sales.
He's like Peter Pan.
There's a few other
revenue streams
that we'd like to pursue.
Like what?
Uh, licensing, for one.
What would you license
and to who?
Um, did you see
your SiliDog tag?
Yeah. Okay, so,
like a Mavs logo or whatever?
Or the Florida logo?
Yeah.
Right. Got it.
So, Mikey,
you're killing it.
What do ?? What do
you need the money for?
We need the money
for more inventory.
The inventory that we bought
we thought we were gonna have
for the year.
We sold it in three months.
We need to have this
going from 100 tags a day
to thousands of tags a day
and just popping them out.
How do you make it?
Where are you
manufacturing these?
We make them all
out of my garage.
In your garage?
Yes.
O'Leary: Mike, I don't see how
this is really an investment.
You take on an investor,
you got to get ??
get them back
their $100,000.
This year, we're gonna net
$100,000 after paying myself.
I'm just not gonna do
the dog?tag thing.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Cuban: Mikey, I think
you've done a great job.
You've hustled.
You've made money.
A lot of these guys
are into the pet industry.
I'm not in that business,
and so I'm out.
Okay.
I think you're
a phenomenal money manager.
I don't think
I've ever seen someone young
walk in here and come up
with a really unique way
to get their money up front
before somebody even orders.
But it is
a customized business,
and whenever
anything's customized,
it's limited
for an outside investor.
I'm out.
These are the best pet tags
on the market.
Yeah, it's a dog tag,
and you've made
a real business out of it.
I don't think anybody
in the world except you
could have sold
100,000 of this.
And you've got
a great brand.
SiliDog ?? It's cute.
I want to be
in business with you.
I'll take a flyer on it
with you.
I'll give you the $100,000
for 50%.
We'll go in half?half.
I appreciate the offer.
I did not expect to come in
with 50% to give it,
but I?I can't believe that I
even have an offer on the table,
so thank you.
But wait.
There could be more.
You remind me
of my ScreenMend girls.
Well, they were
younger than you.
They were in high school.
But they created
this great product.
They were making them
out of the garage.
And I did the deal
with them,
and they have now surpassed
$8 million in sales.
So similar.
But it took a lot of work.
I had to get them out of the
garage and into major retailers
and with
a major manufacturer.
I think that to give you
an offer of the $100,000,
I would have to get 51%.
?Whoa.
?Wow. It gets worse.
?You're ??
?Do I hear 60%?
[ Laughter ]
Corcoran: It gets worse.
Greiner: Regardless
of what he's saying,
that's the deal that I did
with my ScreenMend girls,
and I got it
out of their garage.
O'Leary: Okay, we got that.
And like I said, they've done
$8 million in sales,
paid for both of their colleges,
and they're happy as can be.
51% is so that I would be able
to have control...
We got that.
...if we needed
to have major decisions.
Michael, you have two offers.
What are you gonna do?
I?I know my in and outs
of this business.
I know numbers, I know how to
sell it, I know how to grow it.
Why would you need the 51%?
I want to work down
on the equity.
He's an MBA.
I know how smart you are.
I know you can sell.
And I know
you're driven and hardworking.
Well, if he's so smart,
trust him, Lori.
But...
... what I'm thinking about
is the experience
that I went through
with the ScreenMend.
I had to find for them
the very best manufacturing.
I redid
all of their packaging.
I got them into retailers
across the entire country ??
major ones.
Mikey, I don't want you
to work for me.
And we did $8 million
in just a couple of years.
You don't need
to give up 51%.
O'Leary:
The two offers are very close.
One is a control offer.
One's a partnership offer.
You got to make a decision.
I would love, of course, to have
both of you come in together,
if that would be a possibility.
Is there any chance you would
come down to $100,000 for 25%?
I don't think that
that's the right deal for me.
So I'm out.
You're out?
Robert?
Because I don't have
that feel for it,
like I normally do
with a business,
it ?? it's just pure you.
I'll give you $100,000
for 50%.
Robert, do you have
any flexibility?
I don't.
It's yes or no.
Is everybody else out?
We're very out.
I'm gonna go back in.
I'm gonna make you
a better offer.
Ah!
Narrator:
Four Sharks are out.
Mikey has one offer
left on the table...
$100,000 for 50%.
...for his silicone
pet tag company SiliDog.
But Barbara seems
to have had a change of heart.
I'm gonna go back in.
I'm gonna make you
a better offer.
O'Leary: Ah!
I'm gonna make you
a fair offer. All right?
I'm gonna give you
the $100,000 for 30%,
but I want to get $2 a tag
as you sell them.
Barbara, that doesn't sound
very fair.
Well, it's up to him.
What's happened there
is basically ??
You're ?? You're taking $2
a tag, <i>and</i> you're taking 30%.
Until the money
is paid back.
Can you afford $2 a unit?
Not with the wholesale
structure. I ??
Mikey, I'm not gonna argue
with Barbara.
If you think that's a better
offer, power to you.
So you're ?? you're
staying with your offer?
I'm staying with my offer.
With 50%.
Because ?? It's ??
I'm in pain now,
waiting for you
to make a decision,
I'll make it easy
for you.
I'll do the same thing.
I'll give you $100,000
for 30%
and only a $1 per tag
in royalty.
I'll tell you what ??
I'll match his offer.
30%, $1 a tag.
Wait.
I can help you, Michael.
I'll do it for 75 cents.
Now make her match that.
You should decide.
That takes a lot less pressure.
Now decide ?? Who do you want
to have as a partner?
I'm just having fun squeezing
Barbara's head for you.
Now you have a choice.
You've got three offers.
I'll give you $100,000,
30%, 50 cents.
?Yeah.
?Oh, my God.
?Well, that's hard to beat.
?I'm out.
O'Leary: Oh. Ouch.
I'll give you the $100,000
for 30% and 25 cents a tag.
Cuban: But wait!
I'm still out.
[ Laughter ]
Doing that to me?
?Oh!
?Bentley, get him!
Okay, I'm worried
about the dog dying,
so I want you
to make a decision.
?Ah.
?Congratulations, Mikey.
?Thank you so much, guys.
?Good luck.
?Thank you. Thank you so much.
?Good job, Mikey.
Bentley, we got a deal!
[ Laughs ]
[ Voice breaking ]
This has been a long road,
and a lot of hard work.
And it's all coming true
right now.
[ Sobbing ]
[ Bentley whimpering ]
To have a Shark
on the SiliDog team
will open the door
to endless possibilities.
To have someone like a Shark
on my team ??
I know I'm a killer salesman,
but to have that in my back
pocket ?? Man, am I ready.
