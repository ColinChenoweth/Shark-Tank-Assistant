Kelly: ...you know,
just in its purest state.
?Pretty good.
?It's very good.
Kelly: A person that usually
is not really a good cook ??
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
?The Asian I love.
?You like it?
You like it? Yes.
So, what we wanted
to really share with you guys
is how awesome it is,
Kelly: 800 manufacturers.
At the end of the day, we walked
away with a regional deal.
We're in 170 stores.
Yeah.
You're in 170 Walmart stores?
It is so hard to get into
Walmart for a small business.
Right.
Tell us about
your Walmart journey.
What's the plan? Are they gonna
roll you out to more stores?
So, again, we've just started
with them in March.
Right.
We've already been connected
to the Women's Initiative ??
the Women's Economic Initiative.
I was gonna ask you that.
Right.
I've had conversations
with my senior buyers,
Okay, okay, would they...
Kelly, we never asked ??
What does it cost?
Kelly: Right now,
we are manufacturing,
Jorrae: Mm?hmm.
Right.
Kelly:
You know what?
I do not feel like
it was a wasted effort.
I would do it all again.
We know that it's going
to be the sauce
in every single household.
It's not a matter of if...
but when.
But when.
The chances of that
actually being successful,
even with the Walmart ??
Wrong, wrong, wrong.
Herjavec: You are so ??
Oh, no.
Walmart will get behind them.
?Success is relative.
?Did you know everything
when you started
your first business?
Look, I'm looking at it
saying "no chance."
It's a total commodity.
Kevin, what you're missing ??
What you're missing is ??
So, they are dying to take
a company like that.
I'm not missing anything.
You can sell it ??
I noticed you didn't put
a dime into it.
?What?
?The issue is scale.
It's not whether or not
they'll be profitable,
because they can sell it, they
can hire more people to sell it.
It's just how much.
$500,000 a year ??
My whole point
about these dialogues
we're having with these people
with all this glowing
encouragement is,
you're not giving them
the real risk profile
of what they're spending
their time doing.
Okay, let's ?? Okay, Kevin,
let's talk about the ??
That's the truth.
Let's talk
about the risk profile.
That's the truth.
Kevin, you're an idiot.
Okay, let me tell you ??
Let me tell you ??
Somebody needs
to tell them the truth.
Thank goodness I'm here, Mark.
Thank goodness I'm here.
So, Kevin ?? Kevin,
do you think maybe ??
Because, you know,
all this glowing stuff,
that means the three of them
spend the next two years
trying to sell a hot sauce?
Listen to me, Kevin!
Listen!
I'm not doing
this "Kumbaya" stuff.
