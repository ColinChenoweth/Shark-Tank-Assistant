I'm Jorrae.
And I'm Kelly.
And we're sisters from
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
You know
why it's gonna be really good?
'Cause you made it.
Because I made it.
I'll tell you the truth.
We've cooked all our lives.
We love to cook.
My mom
was the best cook ever.
We would go to church
on Sundays, come home,
and she would tear
the kitchen up.
So it's very important
that we continue the tradition.
Whoo!
How about this?
One dinner four years ago,
I couldn't find the taste
that I wanted,
so I decided
to make it myself.
Here you go.
Eat up.
When we tried it, everyone
said it was the best thing
they had ever tasted.
Everybody enjoying the food?
?Oh, yeah!
?Yeah!
And from that point,
we decided to give it a name.
Lulu Bang.
Lulu Bang.
We named the product
after our brother Mike,
whose nickname
was Lulu Bang.
He was carjacked and taken away
from us, tragically,
and it's our way
of keeping his legacy alive.
Having a Shark
taste our product
and validate
that it is real good
will just make this journey
all the more sweeter.
I'm Jorrae.
And my name is Kelly.
And we're from
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
We're seeking $150,000
in exchange for 10% equity
in our company.
Now, Sharks, let's face it.
If you're like us,
you like to bang.
It's one of the few simple joys
and pleasures in life.
And if you're like me,
you want to bang
breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
We've created
a masterpiece product line...
What?
...that will have you
wanting to...
bang everything.
Bang everything.
So, without further ado,
we would like
to introduce you
to Joyce's Lulu Bang.
Bang.
Our unique sauces
are infused
with herbs, spices,
and natural flavors
that will literally change
the way you eat.
Joyce's Lulu Bang
will have you screaming...
"Bang!"
"Bang!"
But what's most unique
about our product line
is that it is beautiful
on anything,
from seafood, poultry,
pork, and steak
to rice, pasta salads,
and potatoes.
You name it...
we can bang it.
We can bang it.
So, who wants
to partner with us
and bang that thang with...
Joyce's Lulu Bang?
Joyce's Lulu Bang.
We have samples
for you guys to try.
?Bang that thang!
?Bang that thang!
Greiner:
Bang, bang, bang.
I'd dike to introduce
our daughter, Ashley.
She's gonna provide samples
for you.
?That's your daughter?
?That's your daughter?
?That's your daughter?
?Yes, that's my daughter.
?Wow, great.
?Wow!
I just turned 50
this year, guys.
?Congratulations. Absolutely.
?You look amazing.
?You do look amazing.
?Gorgeous.
?Thank you so much.
?Thank you so much, Ashley.
?You're welcome.
?So, what that means is,
our sauce is so amazing...
Thank you.
...you can literally eat it
on anything.
So, we prepared
four different dishes.
We have
our famous Lulu Bang Wangs.
We actually have
our seafood fried rice,
our vegetable medley,
and then we have a fajita?style
chicken and steak.
Mmm!
So, what we wanted to do was
allow you guys an opportunity
to taste the sauce in its...
?Mmm.
Kelly: ...you know,
just in its purest state.
?Pretty good.
?It's very good.
Kelly: A person that usually
is not really a good cook ??
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
?The Asian I love.
?You like it?
You like it? Yes.
So, what we wanted
to really share with you guys
is how awesome it is,
and the fact
that you can use it on anything.
These are your recipes?
?Yes.
?Every last one.
O'Leary: One of the
great challenges of ??
of barbecue sauces ??
and we've had
our fair share of them
over the years
on "Shark Tank"...
Shipping and shelf space.
... we've tasted great sauce,
and this is as good as any.
Mm?hmm.
Right.
That's not gonna be a problem.
Your sauce is great.
No one ever brings a sauce in
here and says it's not banging.
Yeah.
?Right, right.
O'Leary: So, this is
a banging good sauce.
Yeah, but this ?? this ??
this is amazing sauce.
But you've got to tell us what
your distribution strategy is
to get market share
in the sauce business,
which is brutally competitive.
Oh, we would love
to share that story.
We started in catering
and restaurants.
Everyone kept telling us
the sauce is the bomb.
Right.
I mean, it's just amazing.
And so we started selling it
on small scale.
What happened was, the largest
retailer in the world, Walmart,
did a manufacturing summit
last year.
So we pitched our product,
and we pretty much ??
O'Leary: To Walmart?
To Walmart.
To Walmart.
And what happened?
What happened?
Kelly: 800 manufacturers.
At the end of the day, we walked
away with a regional deal.
We're in 170 stores.
Yeah.
You're in 170 Walmart stores?
It is so hard to get into
Walmart for a small business.
Right.
Tell us about
your Walmart journey.
What's the plan? Are they gonna
roll you out to more stores?
So, again, we've just started
with them in March.
Right.
We've already been connected
to the Women's Initiative ??
the Women's Economic Initiative.
I was gonna ask you that.
Right.
I've had conversations
with my senior buyers,
and she actually said, and I?I
really don't toot my own horn,
but when we went and presented,
she said we were the best
that she's ever seen.
Okay, okay, would they...
Kelly, we never asked ??
What does it cost?
Kelly: Right now,
we are manufacturing,
including packaging
and all of that, for $1.90.
And what does it sell for?
It sells for $3.99 retail.
In the three months
since you've started,
how much have you sold?
We've sold a total of ?? in
Walmart by itself ?? $45,000.
How many
are you selling a week?
Do you know?
So, we sell about 500 a week.
Wow, that's low.
How much are you selling
right now online?
Oh, yeah,
we're not selling a lot online.
John: You know,
170 stores, 500 a week
is an average of only 2 1/2
bottles a week per store.
That's our challenge, you know,
because we're so brand?new.
Yeah.
I don't think
this is gonna work.
This is never gonna be
a big online business.
I'm sorry.
It weighs too much.
And it's a competitive space.
It's a commodity.
To differentiate your product,
this is
a massive branding exercise.
Mm?hmm.
In other words, you need
a lot more than $150,000.
Narrator:
All Sharks are still in,
but they're concerned
about the low sales
of Kelly and Jorrae's
sauce company, Lulu Bang,
despite being
in numerous locations.
I don't think
this is gonna work.
You need
a lot more than $150,000
to break into the big leagues.
I'm sorry, ladies.
I'm out.
?Thank you.
?Thank you for that.
Thank you so much
for your feedback.
You know, Kevin,
time?out.
You sell online
glass jarred cupcakes.
Yes. And they weigh ??
They're glass.
They weigh 1/10 of this.
Our whole deal
is to take the weight out.
They're not liquid.
I've lived this nightmare.
The whole shipping thing
is beyond a challenge.
John: Let me ??
Let me give you my thoughts.
First of all, great.
The food ?? amazing.
It is ?? The sauce, bring
a tear to a glass eye, right?
Amazing.
I'm hungry.
A tear to a glass eye?
Yeah, yeah.
That's how serious I am.
I don't know. Let me tell you
what I went through
and how I experienced this.
I?I?I did a deal called
Bubba Baker's Boneless Ribs,
and Bubba had sauces.
What we found out ??
It was so hard
to sell
barbecue sauce online
because people
can't visually taste it,
they're very, very heavy,
and a lot of breakage.
We ended up selling
the barbecue sauce
because the barbecue sauce
was in the ribs,
a small sample of it.
People would taste it
and then reorder.
But if we didn't have
that lead?in
to grab the people
to give them the tasting,
we would have never sold
any sauce,
and I know the issues here,
and I can't help you with this.
Before you ??
So I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
I find the product packaging
a little confusing.
Consumers are very fickle.
When they walk though
that shelf space,
you know,
it looks very Asian to me.
Jorrae: Mm?hmm.
Right.
I ?? And then I see
"barbecue sauce,"
and yet you told me
it's good for everything.
Everything.
Right.
I think you've come
a really, really long way.
You bagged a massive elephant
in terms of Walmart.
You've got a great test.
You know, the branding
will probably have
to change a little bit,
but it almost feels to me
like it's at the beginning.
Amazing job, but I just
don't think I'm the partner
at this point for you.
Okay.
I'm out.
Well, thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Thank you very much.
Greiner: When I look at you,
reminds me of a saying ??
"Some women fear the fire.
Some women become it."
You have become it, and
you have done an amazing job.
Mm?hmm.
And you have an amazing partner
in Walmart.
For me,
when I invest in something,
I like to invest
in things that are unique.
But there are a million
barbecue sauces out there,
and for that reason, I'm out.
Thank you.
Cuban: Guys, you deserve
a ton of credit.
My challenge is,
I need to see a company
that's going to do
$10 million in sales
or $50 million in sales
over the next 10 years,
even five years, right?
But we're definitely
that company, Mark.
I know you want to be.
I know you want to be.
Well, I believe that we are,
and here's why ??
because we've had conversations
with Walmart
and with ShopRite,
and all of those guys.
The expansion piece of it,
we've got that nailed, you know?
Yes.
It will happen.
Mm?hmm.
It's just not gonna happen
in the next two or three years.
Even if you get out
to 1,000 stores
selling, you know,
700 a week,
your business will grow,
and it'll be a great,
profitable business for you,
but that doesn't
necessarily mean
it's an investable business
for me.
So, for those reasons, I'm out,
but, again, congratulations.
Thank you.
You guys
deserve just a ton of credit.
?Thanks.
?Good luck, ladies.
Good luck.
?Good luck, guys.
Thank you.
Kelly:
You know what?
I do not feel like
it was a wasted effort.
I would do it all again.
We know that it's going
to be the sauce
in every single household.
It's not a matter of if...
but when.
But when.
The chances of that
actually being successful,
even with the Walmart ??
Wrong, wrong, wrong.
Herjavec: You are so ??
Oh, no.
Walmart will get behind them.
?Success is relative.
?Did you know everything
when you started
your first business?
Look, I'm looking at it
saying "no chance."
It's a total commodity.
Kevin, what you're missing ??
What you're missing is ??
So, they are dying to take
a company like that.
I'm not missing anything.
You can sell it ??
I noticed you didn't put
a dime into it.
?What?
?The issue is scale.
It's not whether or not
they'll be profitable,
because they can sell it, they
can hire more people to sell it.
It's just how much.
$500,000 a year ??
My whole point
about these dialogues
we're having with these people
with all this glowing
encouragement is,
you're not giving them
the real risk profile
of what they're spending
their time doing.
Okay, let's ?? Okay, Kevin,
let's talk about the ??
That's the truth.
Let's talk
about the risk profile.
That's the truth.
Kevin, you're an idiot.
Okay, let me tell you ??
Let me tell you ??
Somebody needs
to tell them the truth.
Thank goodness I'm here, Mark.
Thank goodness I'm here.
So, Kevin ?? Kevin,
do you think maybe ??
Because, you know,
all this glowing stuff,
that means the three of them
spend the next two years
trying to sell a hot sauce?
Listen to me, Kevin!
Listen!
I'm not doing
this "Kumbaya" stuff.
No, I'm not saying "Kumbaya."
And she has another job.
You said they should stop.
They should really assess
whether or not it's worth
the next two years
to try and take ??
Abso?[bleep]?lutely.
?Look how far she's come.
?What are we supposed to do?
Wait a minute.
What are we supposed to do?
Say, "You know what?
Give up."
My point is...
"Don't keep going because you're
never gonna get anywhere."
...I would like to see
a little more truth.
Then don't ?? Look.
How about telling them
the truth?
Kevin ??
What's wrong with that?
But you don't know
the truth.
And what would you have said
about my earring organizer?
It's like Daymond
selling T?shirts.
Because do you know
how many people said to me,
"This is never gonna go
anywhere."
?The best ??
?Look.
"You're not gonna get
in any stores.
Nobody needs this product."
If I had listened
to any of them,
I would not be
where I am today.
If I tried to find the hardest
profit category to go into...
I'm gonna go eat
some barbecue sauce.
...to get market share in,
I think it would be
the barbecue?sauce business.
I remember
the guy who told me ??
There is no such thing
as an easy business.
?Oh, my God. Order in the Tank.
?She knows that.
O'Leary: But there
are some businesses
that are born in hell,
and this is one of them.
I would rather work
80 hours a week to make 50K
and work for myself than
have a $75,000, $100,000 job
working for somebody else.
Greiner: Exactly.
If ?? If you guys
loved it so much,
how come not a dime
from any of you ??
It's her business.
It's her business.
Not one dime.
Just this "Kumbaya"
you keep going stuff.
We all gave good excuses.
We didn't sit here
going, "Kumbaya."
Good excuses?
I told them the truth.
I didn't have
to give them an excuse.
Where's your eject button?
