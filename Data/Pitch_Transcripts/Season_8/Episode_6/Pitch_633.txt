Hi, Sharks.
My name is Dave Cohen.
I'm from Chapel Hill,
North Carolina.
I'm the founder
and C. E. O. of Sunscreenr.
I'm seeking an investment
of $800,000
in exchange for 10% equity.
?Oh! Ooh.
?Wow.
Cohen:
Every year in the United States,
we spend $1.3 billion
on sunscreen.
Yet there are
still over 3 million new cases
of skin cancer every year.
And sunscreen,
it's our best line of defense
against the dangers
of U. V. rays.
However, you can't see if it's
actually protecting you...
until now.
Sunscreenr literally makes
the invisible visible.
Sunscreenr is a special viewer
that uses technology previously
accessible only to scientists
to allow you to see the areas
of your skin that are protected
and the areas that are not.
When you look through
Sunscreenr,
protected areas appear dark.
Unprotected areas appear light.
You can actually see the spots
where water, sand, or sweat
have worn away your protection.
So, whether you just want
a quick look at your kid's skin,
or you want to check
your own protection,
Sunscreenr has you covered.
Lori,
I'd like to invite you up
to have our Sunscreenr prototype
in action.
We have a U. V. lamp here
which simulates the sun.
You should probably wear
some sunglasses.
Okay.
This is the prototype.
And you can see right here.
There's Lori's hand.
So, what I'd like you to do
is just put a streak of
sunscreen on your hand there...
... and tilt it
toward the camera,
and you can actually see it.
And that's what it's going
to look like when you do it?
?I can see it.
?You can?
And you look through.
I can see it.
Okay, we good?
Anybody else want
to come up for a live demo?
Yes. Why don't we try it
on black canvas?
?Yeah, I want to try it.
?Sure.
A black canvas.
Interesting.
There you go.
?Oh, I can.
?It turns white.
That's really interesting.
So, on me, it turns black...
I'm a white man now!
[ Laughter ]
... and on him, it turns white.
So, what you're seeing is
the shininess of the sunscreen.
Sunscreen's job
is to protect your skin,
and it does that
by absorbing the U. V. rays.
So this is set up
to detect U. V.
It throws out all of the
visible, all of the infrared,
and only shows you the areas
where sunscreen absorbs.
All right, I have a question.
Sure.
So, in the video,
it was very clear to see...
Right.
... how it worked.
When we came up there,
it was very black and white
and kind of grainy
and a little bit harder to see.
So, for one,
that was the video
that goes along
with our Kickstarter campaign,
and it was also outside where
there's a ton more U. V. light.
Dave, how much was
your Kickstarter campaign?
So far, in five weeks,
we've raised $93,000.
O'Leary:
What was your target?
$45,000.
Are you shipping
the finished product yet?
No. We will be shipping the
finished product in December.
Ohh.
So, technically,
this is your viewer?
That's right.
So, it is solely, like, a
monocle or a magnifying glass
to look at your body
or your child's body
to say, where is sunscreen,
where isn't it?
That's exactly right.
So, I have a PhD in biochemistry
and biophysics.
I've spent most of my career
building medical devices,
as well as devices
for the Defense Department
and for forensic use.
?Ooh.
?Now, you're credible.
I got it.
Cohen: Today.
Ooh.
Five weeks after going public
with this thing,
I've already sold 1,200 of these
on Kickstarter.
1,200, though, is not ??
is not a huge amount.
$90,000, which is a run rate
of nearly $1 million a year.
?But how do you get to ??
?Oh, come on!
Now you're getting into the ??
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh!
You can't do that.
You can't do that.
?Okay, but, Dave ??
?You know that.
?You're brilliant.
?Dave, if you're a PhD,
you know
you can't extrapolate that.
What price point
are you gonna sell them at?
So, right now, the list price
on Kickstarter is $109.
What does it cost you
to make?
In the lowest quantity,
it costs us $45 each to make.
Dave, who told you to put
a value of $8 million on it?
That's the question,
'cause I ??
But, Dave, are you ??
Dave, seriously. Who put...
Dave, I think we're all
struggling with the valuation.
Cohen:
So, within the first few weeks
of launching the Kickstarter,
we were contacted by five
different sunscreen companies,
two of which are
multi?billion?dollar
global companies...
Okay.
...interested
in partnering with us.
Licensing the technology
or selling your product
with their sunscreen?
So far, we're in very early
discussions with all of them.
So, Dave...
what does interest mean?
In part, we were holding them
all off
until we had this opportunity
to present it to you guys.
Cuban: Dave, let's just say
I'm hanging with my three kids
and I make
the perfect application...
Mm?hmm.
... of sunscreen.
Of all the sunscreen
applications ever,
this was the best.
Okay.
Okay?
How long does that last?
30 minutes if they're ??
if they're in the water,
jumping in and out of the water
every 30 minutes?
If you want
to protect them properly.
You're only gonna use this
if you're diligent, right?
Right.
Right, so you have
to have the discipline
to do it in the first place.
Or every time your child
comes out of the water,
you bring out Sunscreenr,
have a quick look.
That's the problem.
You can't have a quick look.
You can, because you hit
the power button.
By the time it's up to your eye,
it's on, and you can see.
But I've got to check ??
You've got to turn them around,
you've got to ??
No, no, no, no.
It has a wide field of view
like your cellphones.
It's not a microscope.
It acts like
a wide?view camera.
I just think you have sold
yourself so intently
on the value of this,
you've lost
all self?awareness and context
about the actual business.
I'm out.
Dave, I don't buy the premise
that people are gonna check
every 30 minutes,
however long.
You're telling me they are,
but you haven't validated it.
Your PhD makes you
a credible scientist,
but when you come out with
a $8 million valuation,
you better have a PhD
in business,
you better have a PhD
in customer research.
You better have
a freakin' PhD
in something
besides your own hype.
I'm out.
Thank you.
I've listened to you, and
I understand the risks of it.
But everybody has the same
problem with the valuation.
It's not worth
$8 million today.
Here's the deal
I propose to you.
I'll give you the $800,000
for 33 1/3%.
I appreciate that.
The valuation, of course,
is way too much.
I cannot sell a kidney
to be part of this company.
[ Laughter ]
So...
You wouldn't get $800,000.
Yes, I would.
I'm out.
Thank you, Daymond.
Your valuation ??
If you had come in
with something more reasonable
to me,
I would be giving you
an offer.
I wouldn't even think twice.
But I think that your ??
What's a reasonable valuation?
What would ??
What would make sense to you
given your experience?
Listen, Dave,
you're a smart guy.
Show <i>me.</i>
What offer?
Give <i>me</i> an offer.
Tell me what you want
to hear from me.
Would you go $800,000 for 20%?
No. I wouldn't.
Okay,
so, you have one offer.
I'll give you $800,000
for 33 1/3%.
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna counter back,
Lori?
There is nothing tangible here
for me to really understand
if the consumer
is going to buy into...
?Are you in?
?... using this.
I'm sorry.
I'm out.
?All right. Thank you.
?Wow.
Herjavec: Dave,
you're left with one offer.
?I'm left with Kevin.
?Okay, so, Dave...
Kevin's only offered
$800,000 for 1/3.
Would you do 25%?
No.
That's a lot of money, Dave.
$800,000 for 33 1/3%.
It's the only offer
you have.
What are you gonna do?
We have a deal.
Oh!
What?!
You got it.
Thank you.
Good luck, Dave.
Kevin's a good negotiator,
and ?? and since he was
the last Shark, you know,
I didn't want
to lose the opportunity
to have a Shark
as part of our team.
Narrator: Next into the Tank
is a business
that delivers an unusual twist
to a common product.
