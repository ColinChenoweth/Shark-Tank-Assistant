Hi, Sharks.
My name is Dave Cohen.
I'm from Chapel Hill,
North Carolina.
Cohen:
Every year in the United States,
we spend $1.3 billion
on sunscreen.
Yet there are
still over 3 million new cases
of skin cancer every year.
Dave, how much was
your Kickstarter campaign?
So far, in five weeks,
we've raised $93,000.
O'Leary:
What was your target?
$45,000.
Are you shipping
the finished product yet?
No. We will be shipping the
finished product in December.
Ohh.
So, technically,
this is your viewer?
That's right.
So, it is solely, like, a
monocle or a magnifying glass
to look at your body
or your child's body
to say, where is sunscreen,
where isn't it?
That's exactly right.
Cohen: Today.
Ooh.
Five weeks after going public
with this thing,
I've already sold 1,200 of these
on Kickstarter.
1,200, though, is not ??
is not a huge amount.
$90,000, which is a run rate
of nearly $1 million a year.
?But how do you get to ??
?Oh, come on!
Now you're getting into the ??
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh!
You can't do that.
You can't do that.
?Okay, but, Dave ??
?You know that.
?You're brilliant.
?Dave, if you're a PhD,
you know
you can't extrapolate that.
What price point
are you gonna sell them at?
So, right now, the list price
on Kickstarter is $109.
What does it cost you
to make?
In the lowest quantity,
it costs us $45 each to make.
Dave, who told you to put
a value of $8 million on it?
That's the question,
'cause I ??
But, Dave, are you ??
Dave, seriously. Who put...
Dave, I think we're all
struggling with the valuation.
Cohen:
So, within the first few weeks
of launching the Kickstarter,
we were contacted by five
different sunscreen companies,
two of which are
multi?billion?dollar
global companies...
Okay.
...interested
in partnering with us.
Licensing the technology
or selling your product
with their sunscreen?
So far, we're in very early
discussions with all of them.
So, Dave...
what does interest mean?
In part, we were holding them
all off
until we had this opportunity
to present it to you guys.
Cuban: Dave, let's just say
I'm hanging with my three kids
Dave, I don't buy the premise
that people are gonna check
every 30 minutes,
however long.
You're telling me they are,
but you haven't validated it.
Your PhD makes you
a credible scientist,
but when you come out with
a $8 million valuation,
you better have a PhD
in business,
you better have a PhD
in customer research.
You better have
a freakin' PhD
in something
besides your own hype.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Listen, Dave,
you're a smart guy.
Show <i>me.</i>
What offer?
Give <i>me</i> an offer.
Tell me what you want
to hear from me.
Would you go $800,000 for 20%?
No. I wouldn't.
Okay,
so, you have one offer.
I'll give you $800,000
for 33 1/3%.
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna counter back,
Lori?
Herjavec: Dave,
you're left with one offer.
?I'm left with Kevin.
?Okay, so, Dave...
Kevin's only offered
$800,000 for 1/3.
Would you do 25%?
No.
That's a lot of money, Dave.
$800,000 for 33 1/3%.
It's the only offer
you have.
What are you gonna do?
We have a deal.
Oh!
What?!
You got it.
Thank you.
Good luck, Dave.
Kevin's a good negotiator,
