Hi, Sharks.
I'm Aaron.
And I'm Andrew.
We're the co?founders of unPack.
Today we're seeking
a $500,000 investment
for 40% equity
of our company.
Sharks, we both flew here
from New York,
and I paid $50
to check my bag on a plane.
50 bucks.
For that kind of money,
flying must have been a breeze.
Actually, I wasted
more time packing,
took me longer
to get to the airport,
and then when we landed,
I had to wait 30 minutes
just to pick up my bag.
Huh, I didn't pack a thing.
I just wore the clothes
on my back.
What do you mean,
you didn't pack?
Well, I used unPack.
unPack?
Where did your clothes
come from?
Did you steal them?
No, I didn't steal them,
but they're not my clothes.
UnPack's clothes are better.
How did unPack's clothes
get here?
Good question.
I just went
to unPack's website,
told them where I was going
and when,
and then
when I got to my hotel,
everything I needed
was waiting for me.
So, premium,
location?aligned luggage
waiting at your hotel
so you don't have to pack.
How can you afford that?
You're not gonna like this,
Aaron,
but I paid less than you did
to check your bag.
Cheaper than my checked bag?
You know, I practically
brought my whole closet here,
and I still feel like
I've got on the wrong clothes.
Yeah,
I don't have that problem.
UnPack is
my personal concierge.
When I go to L. A.,
I'm dressed for L. A.
You think someone like me
could ever unPack?
No.
But since
we're on national television,
we're gonna make
an exception.
And just remember ?? Everything
you need is already there.
Everything I need
is already there.
Sharks, unPack
is ready for takeoff.
Who's coming with us?
Okay, Abbott and Costello.
Tell us about what it costs...
Yep.
... what we can ship,
what we can't ship,
et cetera, et cetera.
Sure. So, right now,
we're shipping everything.
So we're doing
your entire set of clothing.
We're doing
underwear and socks.
Those you get to keep.
Then the only thing we're not
doing is shoes, to date.
Are they men and women?
?Men and women, yes.
?So, you're ??
The majority of our customers
to date have been men, though.
But are they used clothes?
They're used clothes.
?What?
?So, you recycle them?
?But they're someone else's?
?You're kidding.
Like ?? Like,
you ship them to L. A.,
I?I show up ??
I show up at the hotel.
Yep.
They're there.
I wear my clothes.
Yep.
I put them back in the box.
Yep.
I ship them back.
That's right.
You clean them.
And then I have to wear
Mark's clothes?
And then the next guy
wears them.
You get a chance
to be Mark Cuban.
I mean, how do you do that?
Well, wait a minute.
That's kind of horrifying.
I don't want
to be Mark Cuban!
John:
Well, all the sizes.
What are they ?? a bunch
of ponchos or something?
You fill out a profile that's
very similar to other companies
in the style?curation
and clothing?delivery space.
So we learn a lot about your
size and style preferences.
And then once we know your
brands that you already wear,
we're able to put together
a pack that works for you
in the context
in which you're traveling.
?What was the age group?
?And ?? And how much is it?
?$20 a day.
?$20 a day.
I go on vacation for five days,
it's $100?
Five days, $100.
Yeah.
Okay, got it.
So, I have a hard time
having things fit me right.
Yeah.
I would be more worried
about what's in that package
sitting there waiting for me,
and I've brought nothing else...
Mm?hmm.
...that maybe doesn't fit
or I don't like it or whatever.
Mm?hmm.
What happens
if it doesn't get there?
Great question, and we're
so glad you brought it up
because that's one of the things
that we think
can make our company
really valuable.
This is, first of all,
a problem
that the entire fashion
and e?commerce industry
is working on to make sure
that they can get the fit right
the first time
and reduce
the return percentage rate.
But, Andrew,
what problem am I solving?
Because you said
at the beginning...
Yep.
...you're saving the fee
to send my own bag.
What's an av??
You're also making
your trip better.
I'm on the trip for five days.
That's $100.
If I'm spending more than two
days, I'm not saving any money.
You are saving money when
you get into the clothes
that are in the box.
You already own
a lot of clothes.
But you say you don't have
to take anything.
Look at Kevin O'Leary.
Yeah.
He would have
to take his shoes,
he would have to take
deodorant and stuff,
his ?? his ?? pack his teeth.
Yeah.
He has a whole lot of things
that he's gonna need
in this bag, right?
Yeah.
?Pack his what?
?Teeth.
You don't eliminate the fact
of not having bags.
Liskov: This is why
it's important that we
target the customer,
and this is one of the things
that we benefited
from the six months that we've
been working on this full time,
is that we learned about
who is gonna use this.
Greiner: Okay.
So, you've only done this
for six months?
Kevin O'Leary
is not gonna use ??
?Why wouldn't I use it?
?So, do you have sales, and ??
We do. Right now,
we've had 40 bookings,
and we've had
38 people use unPack.
And what are
your reviews like?
Yeah, baby!
?No, seriously.
?You've made ??
You've made
hundreds of dollars.
Flex pump. Let's do the flex
for that.
You've made
hundreds of dollars.
Liskov: Better than 37.
No, no.
They've made <i>tens</i> of dollars.
So, yes, our ability
to serve customers
is limited in the beginning,
and that's why we're looking
for capital,
but the market potential here
is huge.
The problem is,
you're brand?new.
Mm?hmm.
And you're competing
in two very large markets.
You're competing
for the consumer
that wants to curate clothes.
That's one market.
The other market of saving me
money by checking my bag in ??
That's
a whole different problem,
because you're not really
saving people money.
It's not about the savings.
Okay, so it's not
about the savings.
It's about solving ??
It's about the solving
the inconvenience of ??
But you're solving
the wrong problem, guys.
?Right.
?That's the problem.
Greiner: Right.
So, first of all,
your name sucks,
because it suggests that
you're competing with people
that package and ship
for you.
That's what I thought
and I think everybody else
thought you were doing,
as well, right?
?Yeah.
?Okay.
Now, put that aside.
What you could do that
would be far better in my mind,
and you ?? It would
save people money, go ??
Are you gonna reinvent
their business plan?
Always.
That's what I always do.
That's so important.
Going to Vegas, right?
Not unPack ?? FunPack.
If I ?? If I can go
to your website, pick Vegas,
click on "club,"
and there's three looks.
Yeah.
And I pick one of those looks,
and it just shows up.
Yep.
That's cool.
That's exactly the company
we want to create.
That's the product.
We ?? We are ?? We are going
in that direction,
and that requires
an overhaul
of the look and feel,
so right now ??
You're asking for $500,000
for us
to redo everything with you.
Not to redo everything.
We're optimizing.
Aaron, tell us in one sentence
what your business is.
We curate and deliver luggage
so you don't have to pack.
?No.
?Luggage.
No. Luggage.
You know what?
That's wrong.
?That's not your business.
?That's not your business.
I'm gonna tell you
your business.
Their business is,
"We don't know what the hell
we're talking about."
No.
"We rent you fun clothes
for any trip for $20
so you don't have
to buy them."
You guys don't know
what business you're in.
You don't know
how you're gonna get there.
The ?? What you're trying
to sell you're delusional about
'cause it has nothing to do
with luggage and packing.
You guys are confused.
I'm out.
Thanks ??
Thanks for your time.
This business is synchronized
to the trend
in the airline industry...
No.
... to micro?monetize
every aspect of the experience.
Aaron, the ?? the more
you guys talk ??
Oh, God.
... the more things
you explain,
the more layers
you add to it ??
That just empowers
the value proposition.
Those are ??
Those are ?? Those are
the rational aspects of it.
I don't like
the business idea.
I don't think people
are gonna wear used clothes.
I'm out.
O'Leary: Guys, I'm always
an optimist, you know?
Even when the presentation
is horrendous,
as this one has been.
I'm always looking
for that gem of upside.
I needed to understand
the business model
right out of the gate
early on
because it's just
opportunistic at this point.
And if you had been
much better at doing that,
maybe, <i>maybe</i> you'd get
a deal here today,
but things aren't going well.
I'm out.
I have absolutely no problem
with the ?? the amount
of people you sold to
because then it wouldn't be
a great opportunity, right?
I have
a tuxedo?rental company.
You know
what the biggest issue we have?
Cleaning.
Mm?hmm.
Right.
We have a warehouse
a million square feet,
and we can only basically rent
a tuxedo 12 times
before we have
to throw it away.
But you still don't
take away the luggage issue.
Many of the travelers are
going to need to bring things
that are very personal
to them.
Mm?hmm.
I can't take this ride
with you.
I'm out.
This is a new concept.
It's experimental,
and that's why we think
that it has
a lot of potential.
People said the same thing about
bottled water 30 years ago.
Oh, my God.
You guys,
you have to really stop
and look at,
what is this business?
Mm?hmm.
There are so many pieces to this
that I'm sorry to say it,
but I see it as a complete
and total nightmare.
I'm out.
Time to go packing.
?That was brutal.
?[ Groans ]
I think it's easy to walk out
of a situation like that
and say, "Oh, man, well,
this is a losing battle,"
but this is a new idea,
and people don't know
what it looks like
'cause it hasn't ??
It hasn't been done yet.
Narrator: Back in season five,
Melissa and Rick Hinnant
made a deal
with Barbara Corcoran
for their fashion sock company
Grace &amp; Lace.
You picked the smartest person
here. Good for you.
Let's see
what they're up to now.
Melissa: Today is a huge day
for Grace &amp; Lace.
We're finally
in our new facility,
and Barbara arrives
to welcome our first intern.
Rick, Melissa.
Hey!
Hi!
Rick: Before "Shark Tank," we
did a little over $1 million.
It's been three years,
and we've just crossed
$19 million in sales.
We had six employees.
Now we have 47.
$19 million in sales
allowed us
to do the charitable work
that our hearts desire.
We've been able to open
seven orphanages in India,
and we have plans to open
schools in India and Nepal
to give these kids
a very bright future.
?There she is.
?Hey!
We're welcoming Kendall,
our first intern.
She's gonna be our ambassador
to our schools in India,
where they are being taught
a skilled trade,
which gives them a chance
at a career path.
Well, I think we have
a lot of work to do.
What do you say?
The new internship program
is just another way
that Grace &amp; Lace
is gonna give back.
They're taking young girls
with an interest in design,
and they're gonna teach them how
to make a living in this field.
Hi, Susanna.
How are you?
Corcoran: I've been making so
much money on this investment,
but the satisfaction now
is seeing
how much good they're doing.
So, I heard
you're interested in fashion.
Never in a million years
did I think that knitting
would turn into a global brand
of women's apparel.
Now we're growing
our business,
we're rescuing orphans
overseas,
and we're growing
our own family.
We have three beautiful kids
that just mean the world to us,
and we couldn't have done it
without "Shark Tank."
Together: Grace &amp; Lace!
[ Cheers and applause ]
Narrator:
Next into the Tank is a product
to ensure
you and your loved ones
are always protected
from the sun.
