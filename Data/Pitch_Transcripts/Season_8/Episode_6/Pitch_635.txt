Hi, Sharks.
My name is Alex Craig.
And I'm Riad Bekhit.
Our company
is seeking $50,000
in exchange for 10% equity
in our business.
Look, Sharks,
over the years,
you've heard all types
of elaborate, intricate,
and over?the?top pitches.
Well, we're here
to keep it simple,
so let's take this pitch
back to our roots.
Sharks, our company
is Potato Parcel,
and we mail potatoes,
and that's it.
Any questions?
Maybe too simple.
Explain it again.
So, Potato Parcel
is a brand?new way
of sending anyone you know
a custom message
written on a potato.
It's just stupid on a stick,
right?
Stupid on a potato. Exactly.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
This is a potato company?
Yes, it's a potato.
Oh, I thought the outfit
was a pair of testicles.
[ Laughter ]
?Potatoes.
?Oh, my.
Get closer together
for one second.
[ Laughter ]
Oh, no.
You're right!
You're right!
?Oh, my God.
?As soon as they're...
It's the same thing
every morning!
?It's the same thing.
?Lord.
O'Leary: Let's walk through
the business model.
I want to send somebody
a message.
You're gonna write
on a potato for me?
Yes.
So, how much does it cost me
to do that?
Wait a minute.
We need our samples.
?Let's start with the samples.
?Absolutely.
Greiner: Like, how are
we talking about something
when we don't even know
what it looks like?
?Cool.
?Does it come in a box?
It comes in a bubbled envelope
and special packaging
that we're gonna include
right here for you guys.
?Robert, this one's for you.
?Thank you.
Oh, it comes like this.
?Lori.
Lori, we have a special one.
?I get the sweet potato.
Oh!
?The sweet potato.
?Kevin.
?Kevin.
?Daymond.
?Thank you.
?And Mark.
?What's it say on yours?
It says, "Lori, would you be
my sweet potato?"
All right.
?Aww.
?Aww.
?Mine has a picture of me.
?Lori.
Mine's a very handsome potato.
And mine says, "There's nothing
proprietary about this."
?How true.
?And I think ??
And I think
this potato is right.
We knew you'd love it.
This potato's
absolutely right.
So, gentlemen,
what happened to your careers?
What went wrong?
How, Alex?
How did you come up with this?
Yeah, I was on Reddit,
and the top post of the day
was a potato with stamps on it,
and I thought
that was a really funny idea
that you could mail someone
a potato.
1.5 million people saw
a potato with stamps on it,
and I just saw
an opportunity.
Did anybody
buy the potato message?
To date, we've sold
over 12,000 potatoes
and put over 12,000 smiles
and expressions of confusion
on people's faces.
[ Laughter ]
What are your costs?
So, the Potato Parcel with just
the message on it is $9.99.
The one you have,
Mark and Robert...
[ Chuckling ] No.
...the Potato Pal ??
How much is...
?Is this a Potato Pal?
?That's a Potato Pal.
?That's a Potato Pal.
?Aww.
Bekhit: So, that's $14.99.
And we also have the Potato
Postcard, which is $12.99.
?Why is this one so much more?
?Can you just mail the potato
with a stamp on it?
?So...
Or do you actually have
to put it in a box?
So, actually,
when I started the business,
I showed up
to the post office
with a potato
with stamps on it.
I said, "Hey, can I mail this?"
and they said, "Absolutely.
We can mail that for you."
No, they can't.
And I said, "Great.
I have 500 of them."
It's automated.
And then they said,
"You can't mail
that many potatoes."
So we actually now put it
in an envelope
as a means
for surprise and delight.
Bekhit: And, guys, we want
to show you
some of our other products.
Yeah.
?Oh, you have more?
?Great.
Bekhit: So, we're very seasonal
at Potato Parcel,
and we have our Spooky Tater
for Halloween,
our sweet potato for your
sweetie on Valentine's Day,
and the potato ornament
for your Christmas tree.
So, how much revenue
have you guys generated
since you started?
So, in 13 months,
we've done $215,000 in sales.
John: Wow.
And how much do you put
in your pocket?
Well, I typically don't like
to pay myself much
to keep more cash flow
in the business
since we're still young.
So, you're reinvesting
your profits, huh?
Yes.
Into what ?? inventory?
Inventory, hiring to help
with order fulfillments.
So, seriously, though,
you do 215,000 real dollars,
and rather
than just thinking,
"We just made out
like bandits.
Let's put the money
in our pocket"...
You keep going at it.
...you keep on thinking you're
gonna keep the business growing.
Bekhit:
Our customers really love us.
They're always posting
about us online.
They're reordering.
We have ?? We have
over 600, 700 repeat customers.
Do you have day jobs?
So, I work at a mobile?app
agency in Dallas, Texas.
And your day job
is mailing potatoes?
So, Riad, you don't ??
?I do this full time, yes.
?If I go on the website ??
You guys ??
Are you guys 50/50 partners?
No. So, when I started
the website,
my goal was to go viral.
So, once we hit the peak
of our viral?? viralness,
Riad actually purchased
the website for...
So he owns 100%.
I bought the 100% of the
business from Alex for $42,000.
Why do you still walk around
in a potato outfit?
Well, it's been my dream
to get on "Shark Tank."
Herjavec: There you go.
Actually, I've applied
for the past four years.
But there's no equity in it
for you.
You own nothing.
So, you sold ??
Actually, there is.
When I signed basically the
agreement to buy Potato Parcel,
100% of it from Alex,
there was a contingency.
Since he was in touch
with "Shark Tank,"
the contingency
was that if we got on the show,
he would be entitled
to $1 per potato
for the first 60 days
of airing on "Shark Tank."
So, you got "Shark Tank"
schmuck insurance?
Yes.
But no equity.
So, you're basically saying
you ripped off my royalty deal?
I did.
Outrageous!
Riad, what were you
actually buying?
I was buying
the whole business, the rights,
the training from Alex
to help me run the business.
[ Laughter ]
It's been an awesome investment
this far.
Awesome as defined by?
Like, you've made money?
Continued growth in sales,
the PR that we've gotten.
So, what did you do
in sales last month?
$25,000.
Our products
are 70% to 78% margin.
What did your parents think
when you told them you were ??
So, I had to really sell them
on this,
'cause they thought
it was just a waste of money.
All my peers thought
this was something stupid.
Guys, I really ??
I really like it.
I think it's cute.
I think it's gonna ??
I think you're gonna sell
a lot of potatoes.
You know
the valuation is nuts.
Because we've done in 13 months
$215,000,
we really feel
that's ?? that's a good deal.
?Yeah.
?What are you doing?
I'll be very honest ??
I just can't even believe
that they're entertaining
this offer.
I'm gonna sit back
and relax and watch it, okay?
So I'm out.
[ Laughing ]
Don't stand together.
I personally think
that taking this seriously
as far as a Shark investing
is crazy.
?Yes.
?I'm out.
Can you guys
stop standing together?
Just separate a little bit.
?Mark, what are you doing?
?It's not completely crazy.
Cuban: Look, if you believe
the potato business
is a growth industry,
it's fair.
Riad and Alex have
three more chances to get a deal
for their potato?delivery
service, Potato Parcel.
Cuban: Look, if you believe
the potato business
is a growth industry,
it's fair.
In order to make this work,
I need to see a path
to $100 million in sales.
How big do you guys
think you can get?
Mark, we think we can get to $5
million to $10 million in sales.
Straightly off potatoes?
Well, we have plans for retail,
as well.
?Retail?!
?So, in the ??
[ Laughter ]
The ??
You guys are gonna make
good money, right?
You're already making
20 grand a month off of it
just writing on potatoes,
but I need ??
You are so full of beep.
I need more sub??
I need more substance.
And...these are
just empty calories,
so for those reasons,
I'm out.
O'Leary: I'm struggling
with the valuation.
However, because I'm creative,
I'm gonna make you an offer.
Oh, God.
Let the Sharks learn
from Mr. Wonderful.
I'm gonna give you the $50,000,
and I'm gonna take the 10%,
but I'm gonna join Alex
on his royalty journey,
and his royalty's
getting cut in half
because I'm getting
half of his royalty.
Wow.
Why would Alex do that?
For the first 60 days ??
Well,
we actually signed a ??
Wait. I'm not finished.
It gets better.
Okay.
So, after he's got
his 50 cents for 60 days,
I continue to get a dollar
until I've got back $150,000.
Then I'm gonna hire you
to go work
in one of my real companies,
'cause this thing's gonna go
to zero at some point.
Even I know that,
and so do you.
I'm doing this for your parents,
really,
'cause I'm worried about you.
?Set you free.
So, Riad,
I have an offer for you.
?You do?!
?I do.
It's ??
It's crazy, it's fun.
I think you'll move
a lot of potatoes.
Forget the valuation.
You gave Alex $42,000.
I'll give you the $50,000
for 25% of the business.
We move a lot of potatoes.
We sell a lot of stuff.
Maybe we expand.
Maybe we expand
into cucumbers.
?You are so freakin' nuts.
?Carrots. Who knows?
?What are you doing?
?I'm making an offer.
It's fun. It's crazy.
?So...
Greiner: You guys,
you better grab this fast
before they, like,
come back down to earth.
So, he wants 20%
for the $50,000.
Don't hate me
because I'm crazy and fun.
My offer is much less equity.
You don't take as much pain.
You're delirious.
You let go a minute.
You realize that you've
negotiating to a scrotum?
You understand that?
On national television.
I think this is gonna ??
So, I have ??
I have an answer for you.
Okay.
And the crazy thing is,
you guys,
they're fighting over you,
which is insane.
So...
So you need to think
about this quickly...
Lori.
... because
they could both quit.
Let them respond, Lori.
Let them respond.
Let the potato speak.
Robert, so,
giving us $50,000 for 25%,
that's valu?? valuing us
at $200,000,
and we just did $215,000
in 13 months.
That doesn't seem like
a good deal to me.
?So unfair. I agree.
?Good for you, potato.
Do you have a counter?
I'd like 17 1/2% for you,
Robert.
And what about for Kevin?
So, I would like to be loyal
to Alex
for helping getting us
to this point.
Yes.
I'd like to still give him
a dollar and you a dollar.
Yes.
After $150,000,
I?I'd still own 10%, right?
Correct.
So, Riad, which option
do you like better?
The royalty deal
or the equity deal?
I'd like to hear from you guys,
if you don't mind,
what your ?? what value
you would bring to us.
[ Laughter ]
Riad, you know what?
I own a pretty big
cybersecurity company
all over the world.
I was waiting for the ??
I think your customers
are gonna like them.
I was waiting for the right time
to exit that business
and get into
another business.
I am selling that business,
and I'm going full time
for the potato.
I?I will ??
I will help you.
Mwah!
Every waking moment I have,
I'm gonna be thinking
about this business.
[ Laughter ]
Both ?? Both offers
seem really good,
and I?I really love
both of you guys.
I think the most sense would be
to make a deal with Kevin.
?Whoa, yes!
?You got a deal, Kevin.
?Mr. Potato!
?Yes!
Yes!
?Wow.
Thank you so much.
I'm really looking forward
to working with your company.
?Oh, man.
?This is absolutely terrific.
Greiner: You look like
a potato with them.
Give them a big hug.
Kevin, give them a big hug.
Go back up there.
?Aah!
?Aah!
Cuban: Riad, Riad,
just got to ask you.
John: That is horrible!
Have you always
had this delivery,
or do you, like, copy
Jimmy Kimmel on purpose?
Oh, no, I just felt that.
That's great.
Thank you, guys.
?Good luck.
?All right.
?Dude.
?Yes!
Bekhit: I can't believe
we got a deal.
I can't believe the company's
been growing this much,
and I?I really can't wait
to see what's gonna happen
with this business.
We're really gonna take over
the world of potatoes.
I really believe it.
