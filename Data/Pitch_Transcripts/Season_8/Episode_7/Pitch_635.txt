I'm Meagan Bowman.
I'm from Ogden, Utah.
Man: So proud of you.
Bowman: Thanks, Dad.
You know you got this
entrepreneur side
from me, right?
[ Laughs ]
I've been watching "Shark Tank"
since season two,
My name is Meagan Bowman.
I'm from Ogden, Utah.
Do you individually make these,
Meagan?
Herjavec: Meagan,
it's very pretty...
Thank you.
... but let me ask this question
to the ladies up here.
Lori, Barbara, if a man sent you
this instead of real flowers,
how would you feel
about that?
Oh, my.
You want
an honest answer?
O'Leary: Meagan,
I can answer that for you.
?Yeah, honest answer.
?Wait, wait.
It's the lack
of sensitivity.
That's
a good point.
I feel like I should feel
precious like a flower.
Lori,
what would you say?
I would rather have
a real flower.
Bowman: This is not true!
So, Lori would rather
have real flowers.
Barbara would rather have
real flowers.
What does
that say?
My customers have
a completely different story.
I don't know what women say when
you're in a wealthy community,
but in the community
I come from,
if a man buys you flowers,
spends $50 on it,
you're upset with him.
?Wow.
?Really?
Like, a lot of women are upset
that, like, that $50
could have gone
towards groceries...
Could I get that
in writing?
... or a lot of other things,
so...
Well, I don't know
about that.
When they can
keep it forever,
the women
cherish it more.
Well,
you can prove us wrong.
John: Here's how
you can prove us wrong.
Okay.
What are your sales?
Lifetime sales
are $2.8 million.
?Wow.
?Wow.
Oh, wow, good for you.
Meagan, how much eq??
He got 25%.
?So, you gave him 25%.
?So, hang on. He got 25%...
Mm?hmm.
... for $3,000
Bowman: Um, I tried out
for "Shark Tank," got denied.
Meagan, one of the reasons
you start a business
is to retain equity.
Right.
While everyone is impressed
with Meagan's big sales
in her faux?flower delivery
business, Eco Flower,
they're concerned that
she already gave away
75% of her company
to other investors,
Well, Meagan, you know,
you've heard the saying,
"It's better to own 10%
of a billion?dollar company
than a 100% of a ?? "
I know.
That's why I'm here.
Well, the challenge is,
it's very hard to build
a billion?dollar business.
Meagan, I spend
more money on flowers than ??
I'm embarrassed to admit ??
than most people spend
on groceries.
Right.
I just love flowers.
I don't get these.
I see these
all over Manhattan ??
in bathrooms usually.
Sorry, Meagan,
it's not investable for me.
I'm out.
I'm number one
in this space.
Come on, Daymond.
I'm gonna do $4 million
this year.
Come on.
[ Chuckles ]
I?I have
the same, exact concerns
that the other guys have,
that, you know,
you started this whole business
to not work for anybody.
Now you're working
for the company.
So, have you talked
to these tech investors,
