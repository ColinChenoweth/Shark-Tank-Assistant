I'm Meagan Bowman.
I'm from Ogden, Utah.
I live with my husband, Wes,
and our two beautiful daughters.
Entrepreneurship has always
been inside of me.
Ever since I was a little kid,
I was doing bake sales
and haunted houses
and any other way I could
raise money for myself.
Since childhood,
my life has been a little tough.
Finding a career path was tough,
and I fell back on welfare.
Being on welfare
was humiliating.
It was one of the first times
in my life
I haven't been able
to take care of myself.
I came up with my product idea
because I had a phone call
with my dad,
and he reminded me of an idea
that I had
when I was a teenager.
Man: So proud of you.
Bowman: Thanks, Dad.
You know you got this
entrepreneur side
from me, right?
[ Laughs ]
I've been watching "Shark Tank"
since season two,
and just watching
the other entrepreneurs
live out their dreams
pushed me to finally
take that plunge.
I started trying out
for "Shark Tank,"
and I failed each time.
And then something told me
to try one more time.
And I got the phone call
that I would get the opportunity
to pitch in front of the Sharks.
You're it.
You're it.
This business means
so much to me
because it is one
of the first successful things
that I've done,
outside of having children.
And I just want it to be around
for a really long time for us.
My name is Meagan Bowman.
I'm from Ogden, Utah.
And I'm the founder
of a company called Eco Flower.
I'm here today
seeking $400,000
in exchange
for 10% of my company.
Let me share a little secret
with you.
Women are growing tired
of the gift?bouquet cycle.
Get flowers,
watch them die,
procrastinate the trip
to the garbage,
and then wait for the day
when somebody gives her
another vase full
of plant carcasses.
[ Chuckles ]
There's a better way.
Introducing Eco Flower.
I found a floral solution
that provides my customers with
a beautiful bunch of flowers
that not only lasts forever,
but are also made with recycled
and sustainable materials.
We create with burlap,
jute twine, bamboo,
book pages, beer bottles,
wine bottles,
lots of other materials
that create timeless gifts,
stunning bridal bouquets,
and d?decoration
for your home and businesses.
Sharks, together,
we'll captivate
the hearts of the women
who will start to love
getting flowers again.
And I got
each one of you gifts
that I wanted to hand out
before we start.
So, Robert...
?Oh, wow.
?Thank you very much.
[ Giggles ]
Wow. Fancy.
So, this is
"Croatia Loves Australia."
This would be Croatia
over here,
and this is Kim's
home country, Australia.
So,
if you guys didn't know...
Corcoran:
Oh, a wedding gift.
And this is a heart.
All: Aww.
Yeah.
[ Laughter ]
Sniffle!
Lori, I got you
one of our bouquets.
Thank you.
?This is beautiful.
?Thank you.
Mr. Wonderful.
I was like, "Ugh, he has
the whole Something Wonderful
platform,"
and I wanted to show you
what I can do with weddings...
Okay.
... and so this is
a bridal bouquet,
and that's
a matching boutonniere.
?Yeah?
?Oh.
And all of your stuff
is scented.
So, yours is lemon,
that's black raspberry.
Oh, that smells
so nice.
Can I smell that?
Barbara, I got you a spring
bouquet with spring colors.
How lovely.
I love the springtime.
And then, Daymond, I got you
lapels for your jacket.
Cool.
All right.
And, Mr. Cuban...
Herjavec:
Those are lapels?
Yeah.
This has $140 in it,
and if I don't get
a deal today,
you got
to give it back,
'cause I'm a little
tight on cash.
[ Chuckling ]
Thank you so much.
Cool?
Look at that.
That's made
with real money.
?Wow.
?I'm spending it.
[ Laughter ]
John: I love these.
Do you individually make these,
Meagan?
I used to make them,
and it got out of my hands,
and so now we ??
Well, that's a <i>good</i> sign.
Yeah. We have two manufacturers
that make them for us.
Herjavec: Meagan,
it's very pretty...
Thank you.
... but let me ask this question
to the ladies up here.
Lori, Barbara, if a man sent you
this instead of real flowers,
how would you feel
about that?
Oh, my.
You want
an honest answer?
O'Leary: Meagan,
I can answer that for you.
?Yeah, honest answer.
?Wait, wait.
It's the lack
of sensitivity.
That's
a good point.
I feel like I should feel
precious like a flower.
Lori,
what would you say?
I would rather have
a real flower.
Bowman: This is not true!
So, Lori would rather
have real flowers.
Barbara would rather have
real flowers.
What does
that say?
My customers have
a completely different story.
I don't know what women say when
you're in a wealthy community,
but in the community
I come from,
if a man buys you flowers,
spends $50 on it,
you're upset with him.
?Wow.
?Really?
Like, a lot of women are upset
that, like, that $50
could have gone
towards groceries...
Could I get that
in writing?
... or a lot of other things,
so...
Well, I don't know
about that.
When they can
keep it forever,
the women
cherish it more.
Well,
you can prove us wrong.
John: Here's how
you can prove us wrong.
Okay.
What are your sales?
Lifetime sales
are $2.8 million.
?Wow.
?Wow.
Oh, wow, good for you.
I've only been open
for a year and a half.
Oh, good for you.
That's awesome.
?Wow.
?Whoa.
It's all
direct?to?consumer
through our website.
Nice.
What do you sell
your bundle for?
So, it's about $59
for a bridal bouquet.
That's really good.
Yeah.
?That's very nice.
?Really good.
How did it happen that
you started this business?
So, I saw an episode
of "Shark Tank,"
and I'm like,
"I wish I had an idea."
So I called my dad and he said,
"Remember the wood flowers
that you used to sell
when you were in high school?
This is an idea you could do
for 'Shark Tank.'"
And so,
I literally tried out
when I was only two weeks
into business.
Of course,
I didn't make it very far.
But, without "Shark Tank,"
I wouldn't have thought...
Awesome.
... on my past.
You have
a lot of competition.
I know.
I've seen them.
Nobody is selling them
in the masses by the bouquets.
They're for crafting.
People are getting them on Etsy,
like six at a time,
to put them in little hair bows
for their kids,
but nobody has a bouquet that
you can buy online for a gift.
What I can tell you is,
they're not used heavily
in the wedding industry
because people want
live flowers.
The industry
is set up...
Yeah.
I think, for sure.
...'cause you pass
a lot of contacts
and take commissions
off selling flowers.
I just started weddings
three months ago.
Yesterday,
we did $100,000 in sales,
and $25,000 of it
was weddings.
?Wow.
?Ooh.
What caused that?
Um...
We have a big problem at my shop
with production,
and so we purposefully hold
our marketing department back.
But yesterday, I said,
"Throw $4,000 at the ad,
and I want to see
what it does."
You're smart.
You were coming up here
and you wanted to brag.
Yeah.
John: Oh, my God.
Okay, so you spent $4,000
yesterday?
Yeah.
I love her.
And what was a typical day,
prior to yesterday, in sales?
A typical day is anywhere
from $6,000 to $13,000.
Okay, so you created
another $90,000 in sales.
Right.
You're killing it.
[ Chuckles ]
How much of your own money
is in this?
Like $700.
Oh, my God.
But I have a business partner
who helped me.
I was living in a one?bedroom
apartment, about to be homeless,
and I was on the news because I
was trying out for "Shark Tank"
for my first time...
[ Laughs ]
... and [laughs] they, like,
did a whole news story on it.
And this guy saw me on TV,
and he called me up and he said,
"I want to invest.
What do you need?"
Okay.
And I'm like,
"I need my rent to be paid
and I need groceries."
How much did you sell to him,
and for how much?
He only put in $3,000 up front
for inventory,
and then he paid my rent
every month for a year.
Meagan, how much eq??
He got 25%.
?So, you gave him 25%.
?So, hang on. He got 25%...
Mm?hmm.
... for $3,000
and paying your rent
for a year.
Unbelievable.
O'Leary: Have you taken on
any other investors?
Bowman: Um, I tried out
for "Shark Tank," got denied.
And the business was booming
at this point.
Like, I was ?? I could not
keep inventory in,
so I needed
another investment,
so we found
a local investment firm
that gave us $30,000.
For how much?
Two guys,
so they each took 25%.
So 50%.
Wow. Ouch.
Mm?hmm.
That leaves 25 ??
so you own 25%.
So, in total,
you sold 75% of your business
for roughly $35,000.
It was hard times, yes.
Wow.
That was
a year and a half ago.
Meagan, one of the reasons
you start a business
is to retain equity.
Right.
And you want to see it grow,
and that's your payback.
I'd give you $400,000.
I would never do it for 10%.
Let's say
I did it for 30%.
Who is going to give me
that stock?
'Cause you're gonna end up
working for me as an employee.
My <i>secretary</i> is gonna own
more stock than you do.
That's ridiculous.
You're ?? you're
getting wiped out.
While everyone is impressed
with Meagan's big sales
in her faux?flower delivery
business, Eco Flower,
they're concerned that
she already gave away
75% of her company
to other investors,
only a year and a half
into her business.
I'd give you $400,000.
I would never do it for 10%.
Let's say
I did it for 30%.
Who is going to give me
that stock?
'Cause you're gonna end up
working for me as an employee.
You're getting wiped out.
You sold too much.
Where will the stock
come from?
It'll come
from equal shares.
We have a max that we're
willing to go up to...
[ Sighs ]
... so we can't ?? I mean ??
and my investors are tech guys.
This is not their area.
I want to get them out
at some point,
and so, I mean,
later down the road ??
So you want to use my money
to buy them out?
I don't know who's ??
Which would be smart.
I feel like you guys
would have the contracts...
Now you're talking.
...that can
make that happen.
I feel like that equity
could be used differently,
with people that know
my industry better.
So ?? and they're
open to it.
Well, Meagan, you know,
you've heard the saying,
"It's better to own 10%
of a billion?dollar company
than a 100% of a ?? "
I know.
That's why I'm here.
Well, the challenge is,
it's very hard to build
a billion?dollar business.
And when you're starting out
in a small business,
you should try to retain
as much equity as you can
for as long as you can.
But you have
25% ownership.
You don't
control the business,
you don't have the final say
in the business.
They're wonderful people.
They really are.
You got to hang on
to the equity.
So, I'm out.
Okay, thank you.
Meagan, I spend
more money on flowers than ??
I'm embarrassed to admit ??
than most people spend
on groceries.
Right.
I just love flowers.
I don't get these.
I see these
all over Manhattan ??
in bathrooms usually.
I don't even understand
why people buy them, honestly.
No!
I don't get it.
I have to love
what I invest in.
Right.
Sorry, I'm out.
Okay, thank you.
Look at you.
I mean, amazing.
Amazing.
You deserve
so much credit.
But this just is not me,
right?
Right.
This is not
my area of expertise.
I'm out.
Thank you.
I just see these
so readily available
out there, everywhere.
I don't think
there is competition.
But you're doing
a great job yourself.
Right. There's not
competition, though.
But I don't ??
We don't have it.
I'm first and best.
I just don't see it as
the right investment for me.
So I'm sorry, I'm out.
Thank you.
It makes it virtually impossible
to invest in you
without diluting you
to a place
where you are basically
an employee.
I'm still doing
a really great job.
There's nobody doing
what I'm doing.
Sorry, Meagan,
it's not investable for me.
I'm out.
I'm number one
in this space.
Come on, Daymond.
I'm gonna do $4 million
this year.
Come on.
[ Chuckles ]
I?I have
the same, exact concerns
that the other guys have,
that, you know,
you started this whole business
to not work for anybody.
Now you're working
for the company.
So, have you talked
to these tech investors,
and they ??
have they confirmed
that they are willing
to sell their shares as well?
They're willing to share
at the right price, for sure.
I need you to be vested
in this business,
so I want to attempt
to buy them out down the road
and give you a bigger piece
of this business.
So, I'm going to offer you
$400,000 for 25%.
[ Exhales sharply ]
Wow.
That wipes you out.
You'll have no equity.
No, that's not ??
no, it doesn't.
What is it you like
about the business?
No, it ?? it dilutes everybody
about 6%.
Would you do 20%?
That makes us all five, equal.
5%, 5%, 5%, 5% is coming
from all four of your partners,
to make me
a fifth partner?
Yes.
[ Grunts ]
Please.
You got a deal.
Okay, thank you!
[ Laughs ]
Oh, my God.
Thank you so much!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, my God!
You're gonna stay
in the business, right?
You promise me?
Yes!
[ Laughs ]
Thank you!
I'm glad you got a deal, too!
It made me 140 bucks.
?[ Chuckles ]
?Oh, my gosh.
I would've gotten that back.
[ Laughs ]
I started this business
watching "Shark Tank."
And to actually be here
and get a deal is incredible.
And I'm not trying
to become a billionaire.
I'm trying to create jobs,
and I'm trying to feed my family
and not struggle again.
And I think I can still do that
with 20%.
Daymond,
I didn't get <i>that</i> deal.
Cash flow.
Cash, cash, cash.
It's ?? it's ?? it's clear
cash flow.
This stuff
is a commodity.
We put this stuff on cards.
We buy it for pennies.
Yeah, exactly, and I'm gonna be
the one to sell it to you.
Here, Daymond.
It's only $399,999 now.
Thank you,
I'll take that.
[ Chuckles ]
Narrator: In season four,
mother?and?daughter team
Tracey Noonan and Dani Vilagie
made a deal with Kevin O'Leary
for their cupcakes in a jar.
I want a dollar
from every jar.
Oh.
We'd like to come back to you
with 40 cents a jar.
45 cents,
you have a deal.
Come to mama.
Narrator: Three years later,
let's see how they're doing now.
Vilagie: Today is a big day
for Wicked Good Cupcakes.
Noonan: We're about to sell
our millionth cupcake jar
at our new location
in Faneuil Hall.
Dani, Tracey,
guess who's in town.
?Hey!
?Hey!
I'm here to help them sell
'cause I want to be here when
we sell that one millionth jar.
This is
my favorite flavor.
Before "Shark Tank,"
we had $150,000 in sales.
Since airing, we've now done
over $10 million in sales.
You've just bought the millionth
jar of Wicked Good Cupcakes.
[ Clapping ]
Good job!
When we accepted
the royalty deal with Kevin,
we caught a lot of flack
over that.
In reality, we've retained
all of our equity.
We've grown
by leaps and bounds.
It was the best deal
we could have made.
Four years ago,
Dani and I were baking
out of our home kitchen.
Vilagie: Now we're
selling thousands of jars
from our new
21,000?square?foot facility.
We now have 32 employees
and huge partnerships
with multi?billion?dollar
companies, like Cinnabon.
Our next big step
is franchising cupcake trucks.
We'll be able
to have physical locations
all across the country.
I'm so proud of you guys.
Thanks to "Shark Tank,"
I've watched Dani grow
from a young person
trying to find herself
to a woman who runs
30?plus employees,
and it's made me so proud
and so grateful.
My biggest hope
is that our story
inspires other women
to start a business
and to follow a dream.
Together: One million jars!
Man: All right, we're gonna
get started, everybody.
?Ooh, she's alive.
?Who's alive?
That ?? they all are!
They're alive!
Cuban: They're alive!
They're cute.
3, 2, 1!
