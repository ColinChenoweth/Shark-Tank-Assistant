Hi, I'm Hilary.
I'm originally
from Pittsburgh, P. A.
And I'm the founder and CEO
of the Style Club.
I'm seeking $500,000
for 20% of my company.
The Style Club
is the first
multi?platform, young
shopping network.
With all the media
that's accessible,
and mobile shopping
at its all?time high,
the shopping behavior of the
younger consumer has changed.
It's all about the experience.
Let me show you
how the Style Club works today.
You can go onto our website
and see some
of our super?hot music videos
featuring
our style influencers.
[ Electronic dance music plays ]
[ Music fades ]
So, our customers
can shop everything
directly on our website.
They can also shop
in our major retail stores.
Or they can shop it
on our app.
Users can go onto our app,
and they can shop it all
right there
with just one click of a button.
It's that easy.
So, which one
of you Sharks
wants to help make the world
more stylish again,
and join the club?
You're <i>in</i> major retail.
Yes.
We're in Urban Outfitters.
Oh, wait, hold on.
I know you guys are looking
at all this stuff,
thinking,
"I want one of those."
I got something for you.
?[ Chuckles ]
?Okay. [ Chuckles ]
[ Chuckling ]
Hey.
Greiner: Yay.
Thank you.
Here you go, Lori.
Do I get black?
Here's your card.
?I get red?
?You get red.
Thank you very much,
Hilary.
You're welcome.
Here, I'll help you
put it on, Lori.
Thank you.
Cuban: Thanks.
Appreciate it.
Herjavec:
It says "Boss Babe."
Oh, my God,
you look so cute!
Corcoran: Yeah.
What does
this jacket retail?
"Love Club."
That retails for $60.
So, how did you
start the business?
I originally started
by creating video content.
How long ago was that?
About a year ago.
Oh, you've only had
all of this for a year?
Yes.
What's
in Urban Outfitters?
Our Babe collection.
And then Love Club
will be going in next.
How many Urban Outfitters
are you in?
All of them.
How did you get that done
in one year flat?
Herjavec: Yeah.
They came to us because we have
a very strong social following.
And we work with
all these major influencers.
What type of influencers?
Bloggers, celebrities.
We've reached
over 200,000 followers,
but our influencers
have over 50 million.
How do the sales
break down, Hilary?
What are
the total sales?
And then, show me
the biggest items.
So, the total sales
that we've had to date
is around $400,000.
That's around 40,000 units
thus far.
How much of that is in retail,
how much is online?
All of it, right now,
mostly is in retail.
So, how long
has that been?
It's been
three, four months.
That's much better
than $400,000 a year.
But those are ??
those are just stock ??
We're thinking
$400,000 a year.
It's has been $400,000
in three, four months, correct?
?Yeah.
?Okay.
Only at that one chain ??
Urban Outfitters?
Right now,
'cause we gave them exclusivity.
And that's why
we're really here...
Oh.
... so that I can,
you know ??
Exclusivity?
Ouch, ouch, ouch.
No other retailer
can carry this.
...if you're getting
$400,000 in...
So, Hilary ??
But it's also continuing.
So, we have POs all the way up
to summer 2017.
And so, Hilary,
out of all these items,
are there one or two that are
the biggest sellers?
Yes.
So, our Babe hat.
?Which one?
?This right here.
Our Babe hat.
This is our number?one seller.
Of the $400,000,
how much of that
is in the Babe hat?
Probably around $300,000.
?Wow!
?Wow!
$300,000 in sales
on that hat alone?
Yes. Yes.
?Why is that?
?So, what's interesting ??
O'Leary: Let me see that hat.
Bring that hat over here.
What's interesting ??
That's a $400,000 hat!
Greiner: There's a lot of hats
that look like that,
so why is that
your number?one seller?
I'm always watching
what's happening online,
or what girls are wearing
and sharing.
I thought "babe" was insulting
to a young woman today.
No, it's empowering.
"You're a babe."
Greiner: Well,
I mean, she's a babe.
"I feel good."
You know why?
Nobody ever calls you that
anymore, Barbara.
Corcoran: Nobody ever
calls me "babe."
It's a good thing.
Now, did they buy
all those hats
from Urban Outfitters,
or did you sell direct?
Well, we ?? we sold it all
to Urban Outfitters
'cause we had to give them
an exclusive.
Got it.
So you can't even
sell this hat online.
No, you cannot, right now.
Nothing's
selling online.
Everything's going through
Urban Outfitters, correct?
Mm?hmm.
So, there's a concept
in investing
called "diversification."
That's how you
protect your heinie
when poo?poo happens.
No, listen!
No, Kevin, you're so wrong!
You are so wrong, Kevin!
Excuse me, Mark,
let me finish my thought.
I'm gonna help you
a lot.
You're all?in
to one channel.
That ?? that's
your big bet.
You've got a big bet
with Urban Outfitters.
It's too risky.
I'm out.
Incredibly
impressive sales
in a very, very short
amount of time.
What's the bigger plan?
Are you gonna sell online?
Are you gonna go
to other retailers?
The bigger plan
is to really build out
our direct?to?consumer.
We really want
to build out that app,
where it's
that video?shopping app,
making it extremely simple
for people to ?? to watch
and shop all in one place.
You're asking for $500,000
on a baby, baby business.
It's way too much money
for me to have confidence
to give you
that kind of dough.
It just doesn't
make any sense.
There's no room for a partner
in this deal right now,
so I'm out.
Well, we're on track
for $1.2 million this year.
Listen, I have a big dream,
to make this happen,
and I know that if we build out
this online channel,
this direct?to?consumer,
because these customers are,
you know, very attached to me,
we can make this happen.
Greiner:
You have a major retailer ??
very cool,
very popular retailer ??
and you're in.
And they've already given you
big purchase orders,
and you've already proven
you're a success.
I think you should try
to just keep making things
and funneling it to them.
Have them
keep expanding you.
I don't see this
as an investment for me
right now,
because my ?? I have
a completely different thought
on ?? on the way
that you should go.
So, I'm out,
but I'd be a customer.
You're cool ??
great way to start a business.
But you have to change
your entire strategy,
and that's what
you need the money for.
For $500,000,
I want a little more proof.
I just wish
there was more data.
To me,
you're a pure start?up,
looking for
half?a?million dollars.
I can't see it.
I'm out, Hilary.
O'Leary: There's good news
for you, Hilary.
You're here on a unique day
in "Shark Tank" history.
There are six Sharks.
You still have 33 1/3% chance.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Chuckles ]
Two Sharks
are still looking at you
to actually get a deal.
And those two
are down there.
John: I was inspired by
a company called Cross Colours
that came out.
They went to $100 million,
but they were mainly in one
chain called Merry?Go?Round.
And when Merry?Go?Round
went bankrupt,
in one year,
they were gone.
But I have
an offer for you.
I like what you're doing,
so I'll give you the $500,000,
and I will ?? I'll ask
for 33 1/3%.
Okay.
All right.
Well, that's an offer.
?She's halfway there.
?Okay. Thank you.
Greiner: Mark?
Cuban: So,
I've had experience here
with the Red Dress Boutique,
right?
And they came in
doing the same thing ??
selling on social media,
don't buy it until
it's already sold,
and their biggest challenge
was online.
We had some challenges 'cause
they were growing so quickly,
but we've
gotten through them,
and now they'll do
$14 million?plus this year.
But here's my offer.
Okay.
I don't want to team
with anybody, right?
What I gather ??
You need expertise and tech.
But, more importantly,
right now,
you need financing
for inventory.
Yes.
So I'm gonna structure it
so that it's $500,000
as a line of credit.
Okay.
So ?? but I'll
discount the rate,
so it's at 8% as opposed
to the normal factoring,
which can be
10%, 12%, or more, okay,
for 22%.
Daymond, I really appreciate
your offer,
but, Mark, you have a deal.
Done!
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
Congratulations.
Thank you.
?Yeah.
?Ah!
Black and yellow.
Yes, ma'am.
Nice meeting you, Hilary.
Congratulations.
Thank you so much.
You know, you're a great
designer. Keep designing.
Thank you.
We're gonna kill it.
All right, are we ??
Are you coming with me, or...?
What are we doing?
Okay. [ Laughs ]
No, you're gonna stay there
in that position
for the next four hours.
[ Voice breaking ]
Mom.
I got a deal from Mark.
Yes.
Uh?huh.
[ Sniffles, chuckles ]
