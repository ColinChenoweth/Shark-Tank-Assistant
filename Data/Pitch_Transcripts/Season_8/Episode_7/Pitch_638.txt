Hi, Sharks.
I'm Bryan.
And I'm Sean.
And we're seeking
$600,000
for a 3% stake
in Safe Catch.
Oh, God.
[ Chuckles ]
Safe Catch is going
to make tuna great again.
Now, I know
you Sharks love tuna.
[ Cuban chuckles ]
But the average person,
over the last 10 years,
is eating 30% less tuna.
And the reason
is mercury.
Two tuna can very in mercury
levels by over 50 times.
Wittenberg:
The great news, Sharks,
is that there's still plenty
of pure tuna in the sea.
The problem is,
there's never been a way
to test each fish
for mercury.
So we developed
a technology
to test each fish
for its mercury level
so that everyone can
feel great about tuna again.
This is our high?speed
mercury analyzer.
We have a piece
of ahi tuna over here.
We'll test each tuna
one by one
for its mercury
concentration.
And here's how we do it.
We take a modified
biopsy needle ??
a sample tool ??
looks just like this.
It takes a tissue sample
about the size
of a grain of rice.
You select
the fish species.
You drop this bad boy
in there like that.
And the machine
does the rest.
Now, the reason we had
to invent our own technology
is because the existing methods
are a non?starter.
It costs 100 bucks
per test,
takes a week
to get results back,
requires a lab,
and a ton of logistical hurdles.
With this technology,
we can integrate it directly
into the seafood?supply chain
and test in real time
for pennies on the dollar.
These machines can perform
over 1,000 tests per day.
But we also found
a better way to <i>make</i> tuna
that tastes better,
looks better,
and is better for you.
So we went out and we created
our own brand of seafood,
and we called it
Safe Catch.
Wittenberg: All of our tuna
is hand?cut and hand?packed.
And we put
a sushi?grade tuna steak
directly into our BPA?free can,
we seal it,
and then we cook that fish
in its natural fats and oil.
Mmm.
This is great.
Yeah. Your business is not just
about the mercury testing,
it's about a whole?new way
that you package tuna.
That's right.
It's both.
So you're just trying to be
the healthiest tuna available?
It's the healthiest tuna
on the planet.
That's our goal.
That's exactly right.
I'm very conscious
of mercury in seafood.
I'm one of those people, too,
that really stopped buying it.
I don't eat it very often
for that r??
Because of the mercury?
Because of the mercury.
Because mercury builds up
in your body.
That's right.
Are you accepting any mercury
at all in the fish, or...?
Yeah, so,
the limit in that fish
has a limit
of . 1 parts per million,
which is 10 times stricter
than the FDA.
What are your costs?
So, right now,
that can costs us $1.20 to make,
we sell it for 2 bucks,
and it retails
between $3.00 to $4.00.
We're right now
less expensive
than the other premium brands
on the market,
but we're more expensive
than the conventional brands.
There's been over $12 million
that has been invested
in developing
this technology.
You guys have invested
$12 million?
Let me give you
some history.
I started this
about 12, 13 years ago.
Corcoran: Wow.
I grew up on fish,
my family grew up on fish,
and we said, you know,
we were some smart people.
Let's ?? "We can try
to chase this down
and solve this problem."
So we took this technology
and we invented it.
And being super?green
and naive,
we said, "Hey, we're just
gonna take it to the market,
and they're just gonna adopt,"
right?
But we kept getting blocked
by those in
the seafood?supply chain.
And we probably chased
that business strategy
longer than
we should have.
How long?
About 10 years.
?Ooh.
?Wow, 10 years.
You had this out
10 years ago?
So, just keep on going.
Keep on going, keep on going.
Greiner: Yeah.
So what happened?
So, we had
about 100 investors
that came into
that last co??
Sean, how much money
did you raise in total
over the entire
period of time?
To date,
we've raised 14 million bucks.
?Wow.
?14 million.
What did all that money
go to?
It took four PhD physicists,
we had three engineering labs ??
Boches: So, what happened is,
the investors got tired,
the company
ran out of money,
they couldn't get
into retailers.
I came in with Sean,
and we bought the company out.
What did you buy it for?
Less than $1 million.
Okay.
The $14 million
got wiped out?
?So they're gone?
?Yes, they're gone.
Gone.
Was there any other capital
raised after that?
Yes.
I put in over $900,000...
That's all in.
... and the company
has about another 900K
in debt.
What are the sales?
We launched one year ago
in stores.
We're now
in 2,100 stores.
2,100 stores.
The first 12 months
of sales,
we did $1.25 million.
Good for you.
Right now, we're burning about
$70,000 in cash a month.
But you have to understand
that we're a technol??
So you're <i>losing</i> money.
We're losing money.
How much will you lose
this year?
To date,
we've lost $530,000.
Cuban: Look, you guys
just made the comment ??
You're
a technology company.
That's right.
So let's
talk about that.
Right.
So, this is
your proof of concept...
Yep.
... that you can do.
What's next?
Well, first of all,
the canned?tuna segment
is a $4 billion segment
here in America.
I don't care about that.
I want to hear about
your technology.
What's next?
You've seen
a 30% per capita decline
since the introduction ??
I don't care.
I don't care at all.
Corcoran:
You've covered that.
I just want you to know
there's $4 billion market.
Don't care at all.
I will get you into that ??
what's next ??
I just want to touch
one thing on the ca??
You guys got to learn to listen
more you sell.
O'Leary:
Here's the issue, okay?
Yeah.
You've burned
through $14 million
of some
shareholder's money.
That's a fact.
Trying to build this
as a model for the industry
that everybody would use,
they elected not to.
So I would never
get my $600,000 back
until you actually end up
with about 20% share
of this declining sector.
And...I'm out.
?Okay.
?Okay.
That's
en?entirely misplaced.
Right now,
the food?tech space
is one
of the hottest spaces.
But here's the challenge
with ?? with your pitch ??
You're not a tech play,
so you're coming in
with a food product
asking for
a tech valuation.
I don't think the market's
gonna adopt your technology.
I'm out.
Corcoran: This is
the way I see it ??
you've had a loss of ??
what did you say? ??
$70,000 a month
Think about that.
Does that sound like
a sexy proposal?
"Come with me...
[ Laughs ]
... we've lost
$14 million,
but we're only
losing $70,000 a month."
I am so out on this.
Okay.
?Thank you.
?Thank you.
Thank you for what you're doing,
to try to save our families.
I mean,
I ?? I eat a lot of fish,
so I'm filled with mercury,
but I burn it off
with the vodka.
So, um...
[ Laughter ]
Does vodka help get rid
of the mercury?
It burns it right off.
You have about $2.5 million
total into the company,
you're burning $70,000
a month,
but you're offering us
the valuation
as if the full $14 million
was still in.
And I really don't
understand that.
I'm out.
In this space,
a $40 million?revenue company
is selling
for $200 million.
Healthier foods right now
are a huge trend.
And we are
a pure technology company
that's gone and shifted
to food.
What about
the test outcome?
No, you're out,
so I'm gonna listen to Mark.
Yeah, I know, but ??
[ Laughter ]
?He's a beast.
?Good for you.
I just want to know
what happened to the test.
Is it out?
Yeah.
So, right now, this machine,
right now, performed the test.
Boches:
So, you got the red screen,
so that fish did not pass.
This is a sushi?grade tuna loin,
highest quality,
but it didn't pass
<i>our</i> test.
We wouldn't have accepted
that fish.
Okay, so guys,
your valuation is crazy.
You're burning through
a boatload of cash.
We're building the brand
right now. But if our ??
But then it's a question
of scale,
to get to your valuation.
I mean, let's talk.
I mean,
the yogurt company
that grew in just yogurt
to $1 billion.
?That's not ??
?Don't do that.
Don't go there.
The jerky company
that just sold
for $270 million.
to get
to your $40 million in sales
from your $1.25 million
over the last two months.
We'll be at $8 million
next year.
I'm out.
Okay.
Five Sharks are out,
but you're still alive 'cause
there's six Sharks up here.
[ Greiner chuckles ]
Lori is liking what you're
saying ?? you can tell.
No, I like what you're doing.
I think it's important.
This is a big problem,
and you have a big idea.
But the strategy
that I see
is I think you have to go
to the governmental bodies
and have them make this
a requirement,
and that's not your path
right now.
I'll be a customer,
and I appreciate
what you're doing,
but I'm out.
Okay.
Boches: Thank you.
Thank you so much
for all your time.
Good luck, guys.
We appreciate you guys.
Good luck.
Have a good
rest of your day.
