Hello, Sharks.
My name is Kash Shaikh.
I'm the founder
of #besomebody,
Shaikh:
Or, Daymond, Kevin, ladies...
Very cool.
...if you guys wanted
to ignite
your dormant passion
for dance,
which I know y'all have, you
could book a group experience,
Shaikh: Yeah!
Whoo!
?[ Chuckles ]
?Wow.
All right.
[ Cuban chuckles ]
Yeah!
?Whoo!
Shaikh: And, Mark,
you could book
a soccer experience.
You can learn
from the best ??
two?time World Cup champion,
two?time Olympic gold medalist
Kristine Lilly.
Wow.
Cuban: Whoo!
What's up, Kristine?
What's up, my man?
How are you you?
Good.
Hello, Sharks.
I'm here today
as a #besomebody Passionary
Kash, you're doing
a lot of talking...
Right.
Exactly.
By the way,
I love your name ?? Kash.
Thank you.
[ Chuckles ]
But, unfortunately,
I've learned
that happiness
can't buy money.
Kash, I'm a little confused
what the platform is.
Is the idea,
Corcoran:
Kash, you have ??
Kash.
Time out.
Kash!
Yoo?hoo!
Yoo?hoo.
She's gonna starve!
She's begging for ??
No, Mark ?? Mark, no,
because, Mark, she ??
He's running out
of cash.
Kash!
Kash!
One sec. One second,
just to finish with Mark.
No, focus here a second,
Kash.
A little 8x11 card
that I made myself...
Kash, you're killing us.
... when I was going
around the world
to try to inspire people.
Kash, Kash,
you're killing us.
Did you bring
a collection plate?
Narrator:
All six Sharks are still in,
but Mark has an issue with Kash
selling the passion
more than the merits
of his business, #besomebody,
a booking platform
for experiences.
Cuban:
Kash, rule number one ??
the longer the back story,
the worse the deal.
Well, let me tell you
about our business.
Rule number two ??
more preaching always equals
less money for the investor.
For those two reasons,
I'm out.
Right.
I find you
enormously abrasive.
You drive me nuts.
I feel as though you don't have
the capacity to listen.
Could you imagine
what kind of a partner
you would make for me?
I'm out.
Right.
Herjavec:
Kash, here's the beauty
of a social platform,
here's the beauty
of a movement ??
a movement, by nature,
is viral.
Right.
You're not getting
that growth.
No, it's working in Austin.
?Maybe it's not working.
?It's working.
We don't
have Passionaries yet
because we haven't ?? we haven't
scaled our marketplace.
You know, my BS ?? I'm not
calling you out on this...
Right, right.
...I'm just saying, my sense
for that always goes up.
Kash, how much ?? how much
of your own money
do you have in this?
$200,000.
?Wow.
?$200,000. Are you ??
We are pioneering
experiential learning.
No, you're not.
Education is
a $4.1 trillion industry!
Online learning is going
three times as fast!
Preach, preach, preach,
preach, preach, preach.
But, Mark, it's important.
It's important, Mark.
Preach, preach, preach.
I still never got over
how you're going
to protect yourself
against liabilities.
I just think you're gonna have
a lot of people
teaching
dangerous things,
I'm gonna put ??
You know what's gonna
screw you up, Kash?
The fact that you're believing
your own nonsense.
These are real ??
this is real data.
These are real numbers.
Sometimes,
you got to do the work.
Just tweeting "be somebody"
doesn't get [bleep] done, bro!
You got to do something.
What do you think I've been
doing for three years?!
Talking!
Talking, talking, talking.
No, we haven't.
We built a community
from this.
He's an instructor.
What do you think he does?
We built
a passionate community.
Go online,
just search "be somebody,"
you're gonna get inspired by
all the stories that you hear!
The people that are here,
they're inspired
by the movement...
O'Leary: Kash.
... to have an opportun??
Kash.
[ Scattered chuckles ]
Silence, all right?
We're gonna own the experient??
I'm calling <i>you</i> out.
In eight years of history,
you're one
of the first people
to ever have six shots
at this, okay?
Right, right.
You struck out
on every one.
I appreciate it.
Zero.
I'm out.
See ya, buddy.
Go be somebody, bro.
Greiner: Good luck.
Hey, keep ?? keep out ??
watching out for us,
you guys will see it.
We will.
We sure will.
Everybody's gonna say
that they, you know,
heard about this one day
