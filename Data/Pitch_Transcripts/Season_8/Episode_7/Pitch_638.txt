Hello, Sharks.
My name is Kash Shaikh.
I'm the founder
of #besomebody,
and we're seeking $1 million
for 10% of our company.
We built the world's first
experience marketplace
with the vision to pioneer
experiential learning.
On our platform,
you can learn anything
that you're passionate about,
by booking experiences
with talented people around you.
You book them online,
and you meet up in person
for a hands?on
learning experience.
And the hosts
of our experiences ??
who we call "Passionaries" ??
get to make money
doing what they love.
So, Robert, if you wanted
to add ninja skills
to your already?sexy repertoire
of scuba diving and car racing,
you could book
an experience
with ninja warrior
Travis Brewer.
[ Electronic music playing ]
Whoa!
?Cool.
?[ Laughs ]
Herjavec: Don't faaall!
Go, Travis!
?Oh, wow.
?Yeah!
Yeah.
Whoa.
[ All cheer ]
Shaikh:
Or, Daymond, Kevin, ladies...
Very cool.
...if you guys wanted
to ignite
your dormant passion
for dance,
which I know y'all have, you
could book a group experience,
and you can learn anything
from ballet to ballroom
to Bollywood!
[ Electronic Indian music

[ Dancers cheering ]
Shaikh: Yeah!
Whoo!
?[ Chuckles ]
?Wow.
All right.
[ Cuban chuckles ]
Yeah!
?Whoo!
Shaikh: And, Mark,
you could book
a soccer experience.
You can learn
from the best ??
two?time World Cup champion,
two?time Olympic gold medalist
Kristine Lilly.
Wow.
Cuban: Whoo!
What's up, Kristine?
What's up, my man?
How are you you?
Good.
Hello, Sharks.
I'm here today
as a #besomebody Passionary
and someone who truly
loves this company
and everything
it stands for.
And they will host
all our soccer experiences
exclusively
on their platform.
Sharks, we really believe
we have the right mission,
the right movement,
and the right model.
And we would love
for all of you to join us
on this world?changing
journey.
Thank you so much to our amazing
Passionaries and #besomebody.
?Thank you!
?Thanks, guys!
?Thank you, guys.
?Great.
Tell us a little bit
about your background.
So, back in 2009,
I was seven years into my role
at Procter &amp; Gamble,
the largest consumer?products
company in the world.
I was leading social marketing
for a lot of our bigger brands,
like Tide and Old Spice.
And I just turned 30,
I was going through a breakup,
and I was trying to figure out
what my purpose was in life.
And that's when I first
started to realize is,
sooner you start to focus
your mind and your heart
and your spirit and your soul
on your passions,
the universe starts to open up
doors and unlock windows
you never thought possible.
And I started to learn
the power of this word,
because it's intuitive and
instantly personal to people.
When people around the world
hear "be somebody,"
it becomes about <i>you</i>
and what <i>you</i> love.
It becomes about
your personal passion,
whether it's photography,
or car racing, or fashion.
That's what's powerful
about it.
And as soon as I started
to really see
that there was
something there,
I got a chance to leave P&amp;G
and go lead social marketing
at GoPro,
working for somebody
you know well ?? Nick Woodman.
Kash, you're doing
a lot of talking...
Right.
... and you're not
getting anywhere right now.
Right.
What's the end product?
What am I buying?
Let me show you guys.
So, we built an iOS app.
This is my profile.
You see all your profiles
right here.
Okay.
This is my profile page.
If you hit that little plus,
it opens up all my passions.
You can add as many as you want.
You can create them.
And then our algorithm
takes everything
you're passionate about
then shows you experiences
around you, in your local area.
It's an experience
marketplace.
Think about Airbnb,
when you're booking houses.
Here, you can book
an experience.
And then you can
book it on ??
For that individual training,
what's a typical fee?
Yeah, great question.
We take 20%
of every experience
that's booked
on our platform.
On average,
$40 an experience.
You actually have to aggregate
a whole bunch of Passionaries.
Exactly.
By the way,
I love your name ?? Kash.
Thank you.
[ Chuckles ]
But, unfortunately,
I've learned
that happiness
can't buy money.
So,
I've got to understand
how fast you can
scale this thing...
Right.
Great question.
... so I can make "cash."
Right.
So, what we have ??
We have a global movement
that reaches
5 million people.
That means
5 million people a month
are either dropping
this #besomebody hashtag...
If you guys search it
right now ??
like, get out your phones,
search any social ??
That doesn't mean
it's attributable.
But is that
of your company,
or just in general
"be somebody," because ??
I was the first person
in history
to trademark a hash,
back in 2011.
But even
if you trademark it,
you just put in a hashtag
and "be," it'll pop up,
and someone
could still click on it.
So it doesn't mean
it's necessarily related to ??
Right, but we own every asset
with #besomebody.
That's fine.
It's great for branding.
So, it's kind of like GoPro ??
like, we branded the fisheye.
We're just trying to see
what connects to revenue.
Right, right.
Kash, I'm a little confused
what the platform is.
Is the idea,
we just get together
and do an activity we like,
like white?water rafting,
or is it
a training platform
where I go to an expert
white?water?rafting person?
Great question. I wanted to get
back to the scale question.
I think that's important.
The number?one way
we found to scale
is through
strategic partnerships.
You guys just heard
from Kristine Lilly, so ??
How do you protect
yourself against ??
Barbara and I,
we go white?water rafting,
a big, jagged rock
comes up...
I would like that, actually.
... somebody pushes her
off the boat,
she cracks her head
to the white meat...
Right.
Before her husband gets
a brand?new, sexy wife,
... he sues somebody.
Right, right.
How do you protect yourself
against lawsuits like that?
Right now,
we haven't had that problem.
We know we're gonna have
to figure that out ??
What would be the answer
if you had that problem?
I think that's the reason
we're raising capital ??
you know,
because we need some ??
Oh, so we could lose it
in a lawsuit?
To insure yourself,
or do you have a disclaimer?
?Well, no, are you insured?
?I mean, what happens?
So, wait. How long have you
been offering experiences?
12 months in Austin, Texas,
in 2015.
So 12 months just as a beta,
you said?
Yeah.
?So what are your sales?
?Are you open to everybody yet?
Yeah, at the end of 2015,
we decided we're gonna ??
our focus is scale ??
so the first six months
of 2016,
we've been
closing partnerships.
80,000 artists
across the country, PPA ??
So how many, um, experiences
did you book last month?
Probably about $2,000.
Okay.
So, again, we have a f?? we're
building a global marketplace.
Wow, that's low.
Right, it's low.
John: Your answer to
the potential litigation was,
you're raising capital.
Is that to get
a big insurance policy?
I mean, how are you
going to protect yourself?
Yeah, I mean,
every Passionary
that hosts a fitness
or outdoor experience
has to have liability insurance
on their own.
It's part of our terms.
Okay, so ??
And with the strategic
partnerships, when we scale,
the reason why
they're partnering with us ??
there's three reasons.
One, because they believe
in the mission.
You heard Kristine Lilly.
Two, because they have
a shared goal of education.
But you don't have
any traffic yet.
Why would she give you
exclusivity
when you have nobody
on this thing?
Because you probably had
to qualify the exclusivity
to an app
or something specific,
as opposed to all bookings,
right?
We ?? no, all bookings.
100% of bookings.
So all their ??
100% of their revenue
is dependant on you.
Right.
But listen to me,
I've closed ??
Did you guarantee her
any minimums?
No, we didn't.
We didn't.
Corcoran:
Kash, you have ??
But you got
to understand ??
Kash.
Time out.
Kash!
Yoo?hoo!
Yoo?hoo.
She's gonna starve!
She's begging for ??
No, Mark ?? Mark, no,
because, Mark, she ??
He's running out
of cash.
Kash!
Kash!
One sec. One second,
just to finish with Mark.
No, focus here a second,
Kash.
Mark, we become payment platform
and tool for them.
But I think that, guys,
what's the most important
part about this
is people believe
in what we stand for.
I'm gonna show you guys
one thing, real quick.
Oh, my God.
'Cause I think ??
I think it's important.
I?I used to carry this around
back in 2011.
A little 8x11 card
that I made myself...
Kash, you're killing us.
... when I was going
around the world
to try to inspire people.
Kash, Kash,
you're killing us.
Did you bring
a collection plate?
Narrator:
All six Sharks are still in,
but Mark has an issue with Kash
selling the passion
more than the merits
of his business, #besomebody,
a booking platform
for experiences.
Cuban:
Kash, rule number one ??
the longer the back story,
the worse the deal.
Well, let me tell you
about our business.
Rule number two ??
more preaching always equals
less money for the investor.
For those two reasons,
I'm out.
Right.
I find you
enormously abrasive.
You drive me nuts.
I feel as though you don't have
the capacity to listen.
Could you imagine
what kind of a partner
you would make for me?
I'm out.
Right.
Herjavec:
Kash, here's the beauty
of a social platform,
here's the beauty
of a movement ??
a movement, by nature,
is viral.
Right.
You're not getting
that growth.
No, it's working in Austin.
?Maybe it's not working.
?It's working.
We don't
have Passionaries yet
because we haven't ?? we haven't
scaled our marketplace.
You know, my BS ?? I'm not
calling you out on this...
Right, right.
...I'm just saying, my sense
for that always goes up.
I don't understand
the business.
Right.
I mean, I'm out.
Greiner:
I'm gonna jump in.
So, there's so many
apps out there.
It seems to me like
this is just not gonna be one
that's gonna make it.
I'm out.
Kash, how much ?? how much
of your own money
do you have in this?
$200,000.
?Wow.
?$200,000. Are you ??
We are pioneering
experiential learning.
No, you're not.
Education is
a $4.1 trillion industry!
Online learning is going
three times as fast!
Preach, preach, preach,
preach, preach, preach.
But, Mark, it's important.
It's important, Mark.
Preach, preach, preach.
I still never got over
how you're going
to protect yourself
against liabilities.
I just think you're gonna have
a lot of people
teaching
dangerous things,
and one lawsuit can kill
the entire company.
I'm out.
Let's leave all the passion
and all the s??
The Kumbaya?
Kumbay?? leave it aside
for a second.
In the end, "Shark Tank"
is about making money.
We built a brand, Kevin.
I'm gonna put ??
You know what's gonna
screw you up, Kash?
The fact that you're believing
your own nonsense.
These are real ??
this is real data.
These are real numbers.
Sometimes,
you got to do the work.
Just tweeting "be somebody"
doesn't get [bleep] done, bro!
You got to do something.
What do you think I've been
doing for three years?!
Talking!
Talking, talking, talking.
No, we haven't.
We built a community
from this.
He's an instructor.
What do you think he does?
We built
a passionate community.
Go online,
just search "be somebody,"
you're gonna get inspired by
all the stories that you hear!
The people that are here,
they're inspired
by the movement...
O'Leary: Kash.
... to have an opportun??
Kash.
[ Scattered chuckles ]
Silence, all right?
We're gonna own the experient??
I'm calling <i>you</i> out.
In eight years of history,
you're one
of the first people
to ever have six shots
at this, okay?
Right, right.
You struck out
on every one.
I appreciate it.
Zero.
I'm out.
See ya, buddy.
Go be somebody, bro.
Greiner: Good luck.
Hey, keep ?? keep out ??
watching out for us,
you guys will see it.
We will.
We sure will.
Everybody's gonna say
that they, you know,
heard about this one day
and that they wish that
they were a part of it.
So, you know,
the Sharks can keep investing
in, like, sideshow Porta?Pottis
and things like that.
We're building a platform that's
gonna change the world.
