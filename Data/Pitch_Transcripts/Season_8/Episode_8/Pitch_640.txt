My name is Melanie Disbrow,
and I'm from Allen, Texas.
My company is Milk Snob,
and I'm here today
asking for $125,000
in exchange for 5% equity
in my company.
Almost all new parents
use some kind
of infant car?seat cover,
but the conventional
blanket and canopy covers,
they would not stay put.
Mm?hmm.
My kids would pull on them,
and they would fly off
in the wind.
[ Cuban laughs ]
?Wow.
?Been there.
[ Laughs ]
Disbrow:
This is the Milk Snob cover.
It fits on any infant car seat
within seconds.
It is breathable,
and you can peek
at your baby any time
without waking
their precious slumber.
It's super soft,
which is great
'cause it's also
a nursing cover.
So, when you're ready
to breastfeed,
you just take it off
and you put it on.
It gives you 360 coverage,
it's breathable,
and you can nurse confidently
in public,
wherever you go.
When you're done
nursing your baby,
you just take it off
and you put it back
onto the car seat.
The Milk Snob cover
has become a must?have
fro new parents everywhere.
So, I'm asking you, Sharks,
who of you must have me
as their partner?
[ Laughter ]
I'm just gonna
pass out samples.
Melanie, I would think that
the best part about being a baby
would be to see
where you're going.
No? In a carriage?
[ Laughter ]
You can actually adjust it
and you can lower it
down the handle...
Thank you.
... which is really great.
Thank you.
I appreciate it.
It feels great.
How long has
the Milk Snob been around?
What are sales
gonna be this year?
We've been selling this
18 months...
Yeah?
... and we made $1.2 million...
That's good.
... in sales.
?Wow.
?Wow.
?I didn't expect <i>that.</i>
?Congratulations.
?Thank you.
?[ Chuckles ]
And where did you sell?
Was it all online?
I only advertise
on social media.
I've actually seen you online.
My wife showed me ??
you were in the Facebook
"Little Mamas" group.
Yes.
When this showed up
on "Little Mamas,"
she literally showed me,
and I was like,
"Yes, that.
I've been dying for that."
Is social media
your background?
No, social media is not
my background.
Actually, I'm from Germany.
And I met my husband,
he was in the military,
so I move with him
to the United States.
And I did not really
have the time ??
we had children,
you know, on the way.
And so I couldn't go
to college.
So, when my son was born,
I actually taught myself
photography.
What do you sell it for?
I don't think
you mentioned that yet.
We sell it retail for $36.
?Wow.
?What's your cost?
What does it cost you?
So, the cost is $7.60.
And everything
is made in Dallas.
Good for you
for manufacturing in Dallas,
in the United States.
That's awesome.
Yes. In the last five months,
we made $800,000 in sales.
?Wow.
?I love this story.
That's amazing.
What a surprise.
Dallas, baby!
[ Laughs ]
Why are you here?
This is one of the more
successful businesses
I've ever seen.
I'm here because
I'm looking up to you guys,
and, actually,
I'm a horrible public speaker
and I pushed myself
just to meet you guys.
And I'm just so happy
that I'm here
and I want to take this
to the next level,
because we also got approached
by bigger retail stores,
so I would need a great partner
who just lets me know,
"Melanie, you have to do
this and this."
Look, I'm blown away.
I'm gonna make you an offer.
I'm gonna give you 125K
for 8% of the company.
?8%?
?Say yes.
Say yes.
That is
a really great offer.
My wife
is my investing partner.
We work from home
together
while raising our three
daughters together.
I literally am
a driver of that device.
I mean, the only contingency
in my offer
is that I get to take
a couple of these home
with me tonight...
[ Laughter ]
... because
I need them now.
[ Chuckling ]
Yeah, yeah.
You know what,
I'm gonna go out,
because I think
that's a great offer.
Yeah.
I really like
what you're doing.
I'm gonna give you
125K for 10%.
And the reason
I'm doing 2% more
is because the value that
I bring to it is worth it.
I'll give you $150,000
for 10%.
Oh!
I'll raise the bid.
Oh, come on.
Yeah. It's my offer.
I can make any offer I want,
Chris.
I don't need your guidance.
And I'm gonna
clear the deck.
I'm not gonna make you
an offer, so I'm out.
You have three offers.
If I go home tonight without
owning a piece of this company,
I'm gonna have to answer
to somebody, so...
Well, then pay her more.
... let's figure out
how to do this deal.
He's got tons of money.
Ask him for a lot of cash.
See, what I was starting
to say ??
Lori definitely has
some incredible skills.
Right?
?Okay.
But she's not hanging out
on "Little Mamas" right now.
She doesn't know some
of the social?media channels
you're using to generate
some of this awareness.
I don't know
why he's saying that,
'cause he doesn't know me
very well, but that's okay.
Look, look, QVC's amazing,
but they still
sell VCRs there, okay.
I'm not just QVC, which
tells you how little
you know about me.
"They still sell VCRs."
I like that.
So, you need to do
a little educating.
So, Lori, would you
go down to 8% equity?
How about if I give you $150,000
and I keep the 10%?
I think
she just copied my deal
because she has no creativity,
unfortunately.
[ Laughs ]
?Is it possible ??
?I like the 10%,
because I really want to be
working hard for you.
Okay.
And I know what kind
of resources
I would put behind you.
Well, here's
the funny thing ??
Absolutely.
I would love to do
a deal with her,
except I learned
my lesson last year.
He holds a grudge.
That's not a good thing.
I don't want
to pre?empt her.
I think there's value
she brings ??
I've been trying to say this
for a few minutes now.
Would you join together?
That would be ?? make my dream
come true. [ Chuckles ]
It would make so many
of my dreams come true, too.
I've been dying
to work with Lori.
[ Laughter ]
But 5% is nothing.
Okay, so, if you joined,
how would that look like?
Well, you make us
the joint offer right now.
You're gonna have the benefit
of two Sharks,
and so there's got
to be more equity.
[ Sighs ]
Melanie has three offers
on the table
for her car?seat cover,
Milk Snob.
But she wants Lori and Chris
to partner together,
so they've asked her
to make them an offer.
Sacca: You're gonna have
the benefit of two Sharks,
and so there's got
to be more equity.
[ Sighs ]
How much equity are you
willing to sell?
I work so hard
for this company,
and I don't want
to give up more than 5%.
But you can't get Sharks
interested in 5%.
The highest
that I would go is 10%.
So, if you guys
would split it...
When you take
a product like this,
I feel you need
to blitz the market.
'Cause what happens
with products
is people
get knocked off.
?Yes.
?It just happens.
So, you need
to blitz fast.
I understand you don't want
to give up more than 5%,
but I think 10% is worth it
to the Shark.
So, your offer
was 10% for ??
I went to $150,000
for 10%.
Okay. And you, Chris?
I'm out.
I'm out, too, 'cause you're
not even talking to me, so...
Okay, so...are you sure?
I don't see you having
the flexibility on the equity
that it's gonna take
to make us both interested.
Yay.
Disbrow: Thank you.
We'll blow this up.
Yes, thank you
so much, Lori.
It's great,
it's great.
Thank you.
?Be proud.
?Yes, thank you.
Can I buy this one
right now?
Yes, yes.
I'll hook you up.
Okay, thanks.
Cuban: "I'll hook you up."
[ Laughter ]
Thank you, guys.
?Thank you.
?Congratulations.
Disbrow: I'm so excited that
I partnered up with Lori.
Our sales are gonna skyrocket.
It's amazing.
It's amazing.
Narrator: In season 7,
Mike Doyle and Drew Mitchell
made a deal with Mark Cuban
and Chris Sacca
for their event?based
home?rental business,
Rent Like A Champion.
10% total for 200K?
Correct.
We would love
to do the deal.
Narrator: Let's see
what they're up to now.
Doyle: Today,
we're in Auburn, Alabama,
just blocks from campus.
We're at
a Rent Like A Champion home,
and it's game day.
We're throwing
a huge tailgate party,
inviting homeowners
and potential renters.
The best part is
Mark and Chris are coming down
to make the event
even more successful.
?Whoo!
?Yeah!
Cuban: We're out here
in Auburn, Alabama.
We promised our guys
that we'd come out
and tailgate with them,
so here we are.
Sacca: You know, this is one of
my first deals on "Shark Tank,"
and I was actually on
the verge of going out,
but these guys kept selling,
and I'm so glad they closed me.
When do we get
to $10 million in revenue?
I think
next year's the year.
Doyle:
The year before "Shark Tank,"
we did $2.3 million in sales.
Since partnering
with Mark and Chris,
we've done $5.46 million
in total rentals.
Mitchell:
Mark just really stepped in
to help us
focus on our business
by taking back?end operations
off of our plates.
At Chris' urging,
we've been looking for
new markets to expand into.
We are now official partners
with six PGA golf tournaments,
providing
private home rentals
for players, caddies,
and tournament sponsors alike.
All right, who's ready
to watch some football?
[ All cheer ]
Our business started
with a small problem.
We never had any idea
that we'd have the opportunity
to go on "Shark Tank."
This has absolutely
been a dream
and a life?changing experience
for the both of us.
Sacca: Look,
I've seen what it looks like
when a company goes from zero
to tens of billions of dollars.
These guys have that same kind
of vision, grind, hustle.
They know they're
just getting started.
All: Rent Like A Champion!
