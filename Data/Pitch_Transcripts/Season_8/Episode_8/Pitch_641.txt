My name is Jae Kim,
and I live in Austin, Texas.
I was born and raised
in South Korea.
When I was 11 years old,
my mom decided to bring
my sister and I to United States
to live a new life.
Soy, kimchi fries,
and some more tacos, guys.
Korean food is passion for me.
I graduated from college.
I didn't have the money
to start a restaurant,
so I decided to start
a food?truck business.
Hi.
Our food truck was so popular
that we've grown
to a fleet of food trucks
and three restaurants.
Enjoy.
We're serving Korean barbecue
in a way that people
can eat every day.
I owe everything to my mom.
She taught me to never give up.
I applied to "Shark Tank"
four years ago, and no luck.
I applied second time ??
no chance.
This time, I have a fleet
of food trucks and restaurants.
This is my big opportunity,
and I don't want to blow it.
My name is Jae Kim.
I'm the founder and CEO
of Chi'lantro BBQ
in Austin, Texas.
I'm seeking $600,000
for 15% of my business.
It's taken me a while
to be in front of you today.
Four years ago,
I tried with one food truck.
Any luck?
Nope.
Two years after,
I tried again with
five food trucks this time.
Any love?
Nope, no love.
[ Chuckles ]
And today, I have
a full fleet of food trucks
and three
fast?casual restaurants
that are extremely successful,
and two more on the way.
I envision Chi'lantro empire.
Chris,
I'd love to invite you,
because I know that you've
invested in restaurants.
So, could you make
Korean barbecue bowl with me?
Let's do it.
Kim: Thank you.
Just come right this way.
You don't have to ask me
twice for Korean barbecue.
All right.
You know me well ??
we're starting
with the carbs.
Absolutely. We have brown rice,
white rice, and noodles.
Let's so white rice.
All right, let's do it.
All right, and we have
Korean barbecue next ??
soy?glazed chicken,
Korean barbecue beef,
and spicy pork.
You tell me.
I'd say
Korean barbecue beef.
We have all the veggies
on the side...
Mm?hmm.
... so I would add
some fresh veggies.
Lettuce, carrots,
purple cabbage,
some cilantro,
and onions.
Oh, but wait,
it gets better.
It gets better.
We have some ??
the original kimchi fries.
?Fries!
?Right.
All right,
and this is for you.
And we have some signature
sauces on the side
for you to try.
See, it pays to be
the most handsome Shark.
[ Laughs ]
Thank you, sir.
Appreciate it, Jae.
This has
zero calories, right?
Uh...
Okay,
what are we eating?
What you have in front of you
are two of my favorite dishes ??
Korean barbecue bowl
and the other
is the original kimchi fries
topped with Korean barbecue,
caramelized kimchi,
and our special magic sauce.
Where are you from?
I grew up in Korea.
My mom is divorced,
so we came to the States.
And it was really hard for us
to be growing up...
You know, for me,
I really really needed to,
you know, step up
and really help out the family.
And my first business
was when I was 21.
I ran a coffee shop.
So, I worked there
every single day
while paying for
my college tuition
and going to school.
And, obviously, having
the first business, I failed.
Why do you think
it failed?
I didn't have a vision
for the business,
so I just worked
every single day
just to pay the bills.
And when
it came down to it,
I just didn't see
where I could take this.
So, I called it quits.
But afterwards, I just
started thinking about,
"I could have
done this differently,"
and that really
fired me up.
When I first started
this business,
I had $30,000 in savings,
and I maxed out my credit card
just to survive for six months.
No, but you know what,
that says something.
You started
your coffee shop.
Yes.
You paid
for your college,
and you managed
to save $30,000.
That's right.
Let me just tell you,
every day, people give me
E?mails saying,
"Oh, my goodness,
I need to borrow money.
Oh, my goodness, I need
to go out and raise money."
And they always say,
"What's the best way?"
And I always say, "Save."
Right?
And you're just
the perfect example of that.
If you bust your ass and you
cut your costs, you can save.
And so bravo, man.
Thank you.
?That is awesome.
?Thank you, Mark, so much.
That's the American Dream
right there.
The food was fantastic.
Really good.
I like the fresh elements to it.
I can see why it sells.
Let's get into the numbers
a little bit.
Last year,
we did $4.7 million.
Yeah!
$4.7 million.
That's badass.
How much from the trucks?
Food trucks are around
$300,000 to $400,000.
Restaurants are doing
about $1 million to
$1.5 million per unit.
We've maximized our growth.
But it really comes down to,
you know,
I need more money
to really grow.
Hey, Jae,
can we take a step back?
Sure.
Now that
I'm catching my breath,
that's some of the best food
I've ever eaten.
?Thank you, Chris.
?It's absolutely delicious.
And I can see why
you've had this success.
So, are you gonna hit
$5 million?plus sales next year?
Yes, we're gonna be
doing $6 million this year.
So, you have actually
lived the American Dream
and every essence of it.
?Amen.
?Mm?hmm.
I try my best.
How many restaurants,
how many trucks
do you want to have?
My goal is 15 restaurants
doing $15 million in revenue.
Jae, I've invested
in a number of restaurants.
I think our most well?known
is "Veggie Grill."
But when we invest
in those restaurants,
we're not
the growth capital.
We're the people who are helping
them in the early days
try and completely
change the game.
We're bringing
plant?based food affordably.
And really delicious food
to a brand?new audience
was what got us
into that deal,
not helping them scale from
20 locations to 50 to 100.
You're kicking a lot of ass,
and it's absolutely delicious.
But, you haven't told me
what you are uniquely doing
to change the landscape
for everybody else.
And so, as they say, if it's
not a "hell yes," it's a no.
So, unfortunately,
I'm out.
Thank you, Chris.
My challenge
with your deal, Jae,
is having invested
in restaurants in the past
and not having
a good outcome as a result,
it's made me
a little more skeptical
about that part
of your business.
So, when you open
a new restaurant,
if the location doesn't work
for any reason,
you can't just move it.
You have a lease, you've got
a lot of capital tied up.
I don't like
that part of your deal.
For that reason, I'm out.
Thank you.
Jae, you're
a shining?light example
for every entrepreneur
watching.
This is the way
you do it.
Brains are always a whole lot
more valuable than cash.
Food was beyond spectacular.
I love it.
I'm just not
a restaurant guy.
I get pitched restaurants
every day.
In order to do them right,
to be anything other
than dumb capital,
you've got to be there
helping side?by?side.
And that's just not
a fit for me right now.
I'm out.
Thank you.
I am a fan
of Korean barbecue,
and this is the best
I've ever had.
I think
that this is great,
but I don't see it
as a good investment for me.
I'm a little bit leery
about your model of growing.
Sometimes, I think it's better
if you really get a good hold
on what you're doing
before you expand it too fast.
So I'm out,
but I love it.
Thank you.
Okay, Jae,
four Sharks are out.
What are you
gonna do, Barbara?
I've learned that people
that start a food business,
if they're any good
and worth their salt,
that they're very good people
in their soul.
Because you're serving food
to people,
and that takes a certain type
of entrepreneur, right?
I have one investment
in Tom + Chee.
That started out
with $1.2 million
when they were
in "Shark Tank,"
and they were
a baby business,
but at least had
one truck, two shops.
And now they're doing
$51 million in sales.
I'm your ideal partner
because I know exactly
the structure problems
they had in developing
their business.
I know the obstacles
they jumped over.
I know how to franchise,
how not to franchise,
and I think this is
a franchise play.
I have an offer for you.
And I could actually
take more advantage
and be more aggressive,
'cause none of the other Sharks
are interested.
Barbara, if you get greedy,
I'll jump back in.
I'm gonna offer you $600,000
for 30% of your business.
?Ouch.
?Whoa.
But what
I don't want you to do
is judge me
as a financial partner,
because I'm a heck of a lot more
than that.
I'm really savvy
in your space.
And whatever
your dreams are
over the next
three?to?five years,
I have no doubt in my mind
that I could
get you there really fast
without making
a lot of mistakes.
So, Barbara,
thank you for the offer.
I really appreciate it.
We're profiting at
a 15% profit margin,
which means I'm able to pay you
back a lot more faster
in case that this wasn't
a good deal for you.
So, 30% is a lot
of a percentage.
Would you consider
coming down to 20%?
You got yourself a deal.
It's a fair deal.
?Yeah!
?Wow.
?Thank you.
?Congratulations.
You are a straight shooter.
I'm crazy about you.
[ Laughter ]
Yeah.
I'm leaping to you,
baby.
?Aw.
?Oh.
Oh, my gosh!
Ah!
Look what happened!
?I'm sorry.
?You're disgusting!
I'm sorry!
[ Laughter ]
Oh,
I'm sorry about that.
?I'm very happy about it.
?Thank you so much.
My pleasure.
?Congrats, Jae.
?Thanks, guys.
Cheers on all your success.
It's inspiring.
Whoo!
I do what I do for my mom
and my sister.
[ Voice breaking ]
So, it's important for me...
to make sure that I'm there
for them, you know?
That I do my best.
That ?? That ?? That
I don't give up.
