Hi, Sharks.
My name is Jack Bonneau.
I'm the founder and CEO of
Jack's Stands &amp; Marketplaces,
and I'm
from Denver, Colorado.
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Steve Bonneau.
I'm Jack's dad.
I work for Jack.
Sharks,
I'm seeking $50,000
in exchange for 10%
of my company.
I'm 10 years old,
but when I was 8 years old,
I really wanted a LEGO set,
but it cost $400.
The good news was,
my dad said I could have it.
But he'd have to pay for it
with his own money.
So I did what most of you
probably would do ??
I started
my own lemonade stand.
After 12 weeks,
I made $900 after expenses...
Wow.
... learned some
valuable lessons,
and, yes, I got
my LEGO Death Star.
[ Laughs ]
The experience
is exactly why
I created
Jack's Stands &amp; Marketplaces.
Jacks's
Stands &amp; Marketplaces
provides kids
and their families
opportunities to learn
about entrepreneurship,
business,
financial literacy,
while having fun
and making some money.
We provide everything
except their mood
and their enthusiasm.
Jack's Stands offers kids
the opportunity
to sell lemonade
and other drinks.
We offer kids
the opportunity
to sell more
than just lemonade ??
Jack's Marketplaces
provides young entrepreneurs
the opportunity
to sell their products
in authentic
and great marketplaces,
and have kids sell
those great products
and tell
the inspirational stories
of these
young entrepreneurs.
So, Sharks, our challenge
and question to you is ??
Who wants to make money?
While inspiring our nation's
youth and entrepreneurship.
So, Jack, tell us about
the actual business.
I have seven locations,
where the other kids
operate my stands.
I'll teach them how to greet
and serve the customer,
how to make ??
Is this all in Denver?
This is all in Colorado
right now.
And where are they located
in Colorado?
So, we have two locations
in a mall,
and then we have five
other locations in
farmers markets and ??
Jack, the mall locations ??
how much do you pay in rent,
and what is your revenue
from those locations per month?
The rent's
on a percentage basis,
so it's 15% for the mall,
and the revenues to date
is approximately $15,000.
?Per stand?
?$15,000 total.
That's the two stands
in the mall?
Two stands in the mall.
And how many months
have they been in there?
Nine months,
approximately.
Nine months.
This year, we're gonna
expand into 12 locations.
This year, we're projected
to do $150,000 in sales.
Good for you, Jack.
Way to crush it, buddy.
Thank you.
$55,000 of that
is from my stands,
and $95,000 of that
is from my marketplaces.
Next year, we're projected
to do $1 million in sales.
[ Laughter ]
So, Jack, in order
to know you're profitable,
you have to keep track
of all your numbers.
How do you keep track
of all your numbers?
At the end of the day,
we'll go through
a mini
profit?and?loss statement
to figure out the kids' revenue,
expenses, profit, and tips.
So, what do you do
to help Jack?
Right now,
I'm behind Jack 100%.
I had my own company,
that was a modest success,
but the journey
that we've been on
for the last
three years ??
working with the kids,
seeing Jack grow ??
it can't be beat.
Cuban:
If I wanted my daughter Alyssa
to set one up in a local mall,
what would I pay you ??
or what would <i>she</i> pay you?
The kids get between
10% and 15% commission
of all the sales.
The kids would show up,
and Jack would
show them how to ??
But I'm gonna be
in Dallas, right?
You're not gonna just
have people in Colorado?
Well, we try to find families
that are championing a location,
and Jack would come down
and teach those kids
how to operate
the stands.
Let's get serious, now,
'cause $50,000 is not
a small amount of money.
I love the story.
I love entrepreneurs.
But I want them to be full?time
when I invest in them.
I don't want you
to drop out of school.
I want you to finish
your education,
then come back to me.
But for now, I'm out.
Hey, Jack, have you
paid back the $5,000?
We're currently
60% paid off.
What's that
monthly payment like?
Um, it's about $250.
Jack, you're incredible.
I mean...
[ Clapping ]
One of the reasons
I do this show
is to inspire
kids like you.
I hope my kids,
millions of kids watching
can turn what they see
into a dream
and from a dream
into a real company.
You know, I started
my first company when I was 10,
so I definitely love
what you're doing.
The challenge is,
there's millions of kids
who might want to do
the same thing.
I don't know if you can
manage it all.
You haven't really taken it
to that point to demonstrate
that you can support them
outside of Denver.
And so, while I applaud you,
I have to say I'm out.
Thank you, Jack.
Corcoran:
To the marketplace.
I think that's
the wrong road for you.
I think the lemonade stand,
kids are gonna learn.
It's easier, it's cheaper,
you're in, you're out,
and you don't have
an inventory issue.
I worry about
controlling the inventory,
keeping it staffed,
telling your stories.
It complicates it
times a hundred.
I'm out.
But a phenomenal job
here today.
A true inspiration.
Thank you so much.
Greiner:
Jack, you are amazing.
I cannot believe
how you came in here,
spoke so eloquently,
so sharp, so fearless,
and you're 10.
Blows me away.
Thank you.
But I think you should
grow very slowly.
Because you are 10
and you are in school,
I think that you should wait
till you're a little older
before you expand too much.
I wish you the best.
I'm out.
Thank you so much.
Sacca:
So, here's the thing.
There's no way I'm gonna let
the best pitch of the year
get out the door
without an offer there.
You said you're
financing some debt ??
a couple?hundred dollars
a month right now.
Jumping up to $50,000
is interesting.
So, here's what
I want to do, though.
I want to offer you
a $50,000 loan
at 2% interest.
But I've got some
conditions on it.
One is, you draw it down
$10,000 at a time.
And each time
you draw down a $10,000,
we wait a few months
and we see how you're doing ??
if you're keeping up
on the payments,
is the business
is holding up.
And if it is, then you can
draw down another $10,000.
Okay.
Two is, I think you should
start a video podcast.
I think, whether it's
on a Youtube channel or
Facebook to Periscope...
That's a good idea.
... I think there's
a great opportunity
for you to share these lessons
with other entrepreneurs
and make some ad revenue
doing that.
O'Leary: Jack,
if you take that deal,
you'll be the most
in?debt 9?year?old I know.
[ Laughter ]
Um...
We'd love
to take your deal.
Cuban: Congrats, Jack.
Good job.
?Congrats.
?Good move.
?Congrats.
?Thank you so much.
Congrats, buddy.
Thank you.
All right, good luck.
Thank you.
?Congrats, guys.
?Thank you, guys.
Good job.
[ Applause ]
He's now $60,000 in debt.
He's 9 years old.
[ Laughter ]
Yes!
Yes.
Nice job.
Thank you.
Jack:
It was just awesome.
Just to get an offer
made my heart skip a beat.
But even though
Mr. Wonderful said
that I was the most in?debt
10?year?old in America,
I will pay all of my debt back
by growing the business.
