My name is Junior,
and I'm from the Big "D" ??
Dallas, Texas.
?What!
?Yeah.
[ Chuckles ]
I'm here seeking $500,000 in
exchange for 10% equity stake
in my business, Toor.
As you know, buying a home
should be fun and exciting,
especially if you're
touring with Barbara.
But for the rest of us,
not so much.
It's time?consuming
and frustrating.
Imagine ?? You're
driving down the street,
trying to look for
that perfect property,
and you spot one.
Now what?
You can call an agent and
wait days for an appointment,
or, even worse,
wait weeks for an open house.
Wouldn't it be great
if you could tour
that property right there,
on the spot?
Well, thanks to me, you can.
[ Scattered chuckles ]
I'd like to introduce you
to Toor,
the world's smartest lockbox.
Toor is the first lockbox
that allows
buyers and sellers
to access the lockbox
with or without an agent.
Wow.
Barbara, I know
you've opened some doors
in your career.
I'd love some help.
Sure.
Thank you, dear.
Thank you.
Desinor: So, imagine Barbara's
driving down a street
and she sees
a property for sale.
She pulls it up
on the Toor app.
She immediately
sends a request.
The seller
approves her showing,
and immediately, Barbara
is able to tour the property.
So, Barbara,
simply walk up to the box.
Mm?hmm, okay.
Press the power button
until you see that color wheel.
Okay, now simply
press "open" on the app.
Okay, easy enough.
There you go.
That's the coolest part!
Now the lockbox opens up.
Okay.
That's the coolest part.
She'll grab the keys,
tour the property on her own
or with a Realtor.
Feel like a winner.
Now, once your done, put
the keys back in the lockbox.
Okey dokey.
And simply press "close"
on the app.
There you go.
Give it a second,
and it will close right up.
The seller gets
a notification
saying Barbara's
completed her tour,
and now Barbara can
leave feedback
and be on her way.
Thank you so much.
Nice handshake.
Thank you.
?Nice suit.
?Thank you.
Desinor: So, Sharks, which one
of you guys wants to join me
in opening this door
to opportunity?
O'Leary: Junior,
while it's fresh on my mind...
Yes.
... what happens if the person
who just did the tour
does not redeposit the key,
but closes it anyways?
If that key is removed
for a set period of time
that you,
the seller, sets,
you get a notification
if that key is not put back.
Greiner:
But if it were my home,
I'm not sure I would want
somebody to go in unescorted.
Great question.
So, the beauty of our product
is that you, the seller ??
you get to determine
what type of showing
you want in your house.
So, if you want
an agent present,
you simply require
an agent present.
That's very cool,
because, normally,
you have to wait...
Absolutely.
... you have
to find somebody,
that have to go get a key
back at the office.
You got it, you got it,
you got it.
Junior, numbers.
How much have you sold?
Yeah, so, zero.
?Zero?
?Zero sales.
Junior,
you're killing me!
It's 'cause we're brand?new.
But, fortunately, we had a ??
Do you want your punishment
now or later?
No, no, no, later.
Later.
Wait, hear me out.
Hear me out.
So, fortunately, we had a
successful Kickstarter campaign.
We actually sold over 800 boxes,
raising over $100,000.
?Amazing.
?Wow.
So, we have over
$100,000 in pre?sales.
How much are you
selling them for?
So, the lockbox itself
is $199.
What does it cost you
to make them?
$50, and then $75 delivered
to the customer.
I'm very curious
what your background is.
I'm a real?estate broker.
You <i>sound</i> like
a real?estate broker.
[ Laughs ]
Sure does!
I flipped my first house
when I was 18 years old.
When I was at college
at Texas Tech,
I was president
of the real?estate organization.
Were you really?
Why is it that you like
real estate so much?
Great question.
So, my parents are from Haiti.
They worked hard to put me
in a very nice private school.
All my best friends lived
in literally the nicest ??
Mark Cuban's neighborhood,
to be exact.
Ever since I saw
these big houses,
I fell in love
with real estate.
Okay, Junior,
Defend your $5 million ??
Before you get
to that ??
Let me let it roll off
my lips ?? $5 million.
How much money have you
invested in this, Junior.
I'm not gonna stop,
I don't know why ??
Kevin, I'm ready.
I'm ready.
Tell me why it's worth
$5 million.
Here's how we make money.
We charge a monitoring fee
for these lockboxes.
How much
is the monthly?
$100 a month.
?Ooh.
?Wow! What?
That's a lot of money.
Nooo, guys.
Barbara, please, educate
these guys on how much...
[ Laughter ]
...Realtors spend
every month, guys.
It strikes me
as a lot of money.
Look, last Saturday, I visited
15 homes in a day ??
each with
an electronic lockbox on it.
Right.
The agents just
held their phone up.
That's it. You got it.
With Bluetooth,
they get in.
So, these devices
exist already.
Yeah, but ??
So you have one
incremental change on that,
which is an interface
where a user can say,
"Yes, I'll let people in when
there isn't an agent there."
That's the only thing that
you're doing that's different.
No. No, no, no.
Tell me what's ??
What's different?
Here's what's ??
I mean,
I literally used this ??
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Give him a chance, cowboy.
Calm down.
You had to wait on that agent
to let you in, right?
Yeah. So, the only thing
you have different
is the interface that
lets the seller say...
That's a big difference.
... go ahead an open it up.
No!
Chris, imagine ??
It's a big difference,
but that's not necessarily
defensible.
?Calm down, calm down.
?Let him talk.
Imagine if you could
see five properties in
one day on your own,
as opposed
to calling your agent,
the agent calls
the showing company,
the showing company calls
the listing agent...
Look, Junior, Junior, I ??
...the listing agent calls
the seller,
the seller confirms it.
That's right.
They go back
to the listing agent,
The listing agent calls
the showing company,
the showing company then
confirms with the buying agent.
Junior, nobody hates
wasting time more than I do.
But why can't the company
that already has
massive market share
do exactly this?
If you look at
the incumbents in our industry,
they're old, they're dated.
Their technology's old.
They have no platform.
They're so disconnected
from Realtors today.
Anyone in real?estate ??
You can't convince me
that somebody
who actually has
a smart lockbox
operated by Bluetooth
is old and disconnected.
I mean, it's, like,
two?year?old technology.
But there's way??
our platform is more
than just a lockbox.
Literally,
the verification part
of what you're doing
is the easiest part.
So, what is, would you say,
your secret sauce?
I don't know if you have
any IP on this, or what.
?We do, we do.
?What is that?
We're patent pending ??
the ability to open and close
the lockbox mechanically
without physically closing,
which enables our remote
opening and closing.
And no one else
can do that?
?You got it.
?What?
Correct.
No, that technology
exists today!
No, not on a lockbox.
Absolutely not.
Where have you seen
a real ??
You're absolutely
kidding me.
There is not
a single lockbox out there
that can close on its own.
You know what,
don't be so arrogant.
I'm not so arrogant.
I just know this space,
and I'm sitting here
watching somebody tell us
that this dated technology
isn't what it is.
So, what lockbox
can close on its own?
[ Stammers ]
So, let me see
if I get this.
Hold on.
My God.
Let me see if I get this.
And poor Chris is having
his disconnect.
[ Laughing ] Chris.
When Chris went
to look at 15 homes,
how did you schedule
those 15?
We had an agent take us
to half of them.
I saw half on my own.
No, no,
that's not what I asked.
That's not what I asked.
How did you schedule them?
You made a plan to go see
15 homes in a development.
Yeah.
Some of us grew up ??
when we dreamed and aspired
to buy a house...
Oh, geez. Should we get
the violin music out?
Just listen.
Listen.
O'Leary: Junior, you've got
the Sharks arguing
about your business model.
Beautiful.
Now, we happen
to have Barbara.
You're
Miss Real Estate here.
Are you gonna give
this guy $500,000?
Corcoran: It's a tough call.
He's entirely right.
It clearly
answers a need,
and you're not gonna
get any innovation
out of the old guys
in the industry.
They would have invented
it a long time ago.
They're asleep
at the wheel.
They don't want the change
because they own the market.
Right.
Secondly,
you are probably
one of the best salespeople
I've ever seen in my life.
Barbara, thank you.
I mean, not only do you
know your stuff,
you kind of leveled
the playing field
with this Daddy Warbucks
at the end,
wearing
the fake cowboy shirt.
Greiner: Well, listen.
I like when people create
better mousetraps,
and this is
a better mousetrap, obviously,
for your application.
But my problem here today
is just that it's
really, really early.
Mm?hmm.
So, because you're not
ready yet, I'm out.
Thank you so much for your time.
I appreciate it.
O'Leary:
Junior, everybody agrees
you're a great salesman.
Thank you, Kevin.
So, the problem is,
you blew it
by asking for $500,000
in the prototype stage.
It's too much risk.
However,
I'd like to be invested
in a damn?good sales guy.
I'm gonna structure
a deal this way.
I'll give you the $500,000
in two components.
A hunsky ?? $100,000 ?? and
I get the 10% equity for that.
Then I loan you $400,000.
I'm gonna charge you
18% for that,
which is what you would
pay in the market.
Would you like
to take that offer?
Does that
make sense to you?
Uh, I'd like
to consider the offer.
You've got to make
a decision.
Junior has one offer
on the table from Kevin ??
$500,000 for a 10% stake,
but $400,000 of it
as a loan at 18% interest
for his smart?lockbox company,
Toor.
Would you like
to take that offer?
Does does that
make sense to you?
Uh, I'd like
to consider the offer.
I'd like to hear from my guys
on the end here.
Junior,
I'll save you some time.
If I knew the real?estate
business at all...
Right.
...I would do
something with you.
I just don't see a path
where I can say,
"I can help you get
from here to here."
As much as I hate to say it,
I'm out.
?Thank you, Mark.
?You're welcome.
So, Barbara, my dear.
Junior, I'd like
to join Kevin on his offer.
But I need to have
a contingency,
because it's
enormously high?risk.
Okay.
It's contingent that we can
sell it to a giant chain
to buy a ton
of these lockboxes.
O'Leary: And we'll both
help you do that.
It's nothing but calling
all the heads of these firms,
all right, allowing you to make
your sales presentation.
You're the best salesman
we've ever met.
[ Chuckles ]
We'll just get
the door open for you.
I still haven't had
a chance to go out.
And you're not.
Let's save the best for last.
Whoa,
be careful, though.
?Got to be careful. Don't ??
?Be careful.
But I think
you were testing me.
I feel like
the very best products
and the very best
entrepreneurs
are the ones worth
arguing with, right?
That's what's led
to the creation
of the greatest
companies ever.
Backpedaling
like the sucker you are.
No, because that means
we're both emotionally
invested in something.
That's right.
We both care about this.
I'm torn. You're one
of the greatest salespeople
I've ever seen,
but this is an idea
that I think
is looking backwards.
Let's be honest.
Keys are going away.
Not today.
Not today,
but here's the thing.
I don't want
a better mousetrap.
I want a <i>bear</i> trap
that's gonna be around
in 10, 15, 20 years ??
A big public company
worth billions of dollars.
These guys like
the short term ??
the two?year,
three?year cash flow.
Junior, kick his heinie
back to the Valley.
So, look, look,
here's the thing, man.
Prove me wrong,
make me pay 10 times more
for it next year,
but today, I'm out.
Ah,
that's sad to hear, Chris.
Kevin, to have you
as a partner,
Barbara, to have a partner
in the real?estate industry,
obviously would be
a no?brainer.
Here's what
I would counter you ??
$250,000 for 10%,
and a $250,000 line of credit.
Desinor:
It was brutal in there,
but I'm super thrilled
about my partners.
I'm ready to get to work.
You know, you make a good point,
it's old tech.
But there's a ton
of old tech in real estate,
'cause it's
so sleepy valley.
I've already seen
the new tech out there.
It's there.
I used it last week.
No, no, that's not true,
and that's deliberate.
What do you mean,
it's deliberate?
That's denigrating
to him, Chris,
because the key
isn't the software.
The software's
the easiest part.
No, no, no.
Like, Mark, you're not making
any sense at all, man.
I'm making total sense!
No, no, no. You're not.
Where ?? no, no...
How stupid are you?
How is he making you aware
of that place?
I know this is
going over your head.
No, it's not, Mark.
Do you think people drive down
the street and look for houses?
They see their dream home,
they see a "For Sale" sign,
they'd love to get in.
You don't understand, Mark.
?And what do they do?
?And what do they do?
Mark,
the device exists today.
It lets you in by Bluetooth
from your phone.
Not in that circumstance.
Not in that circumstance.
With one new line of code,
it can let in anyone.
So, in your example,
I drive by,
and I want it now ??
right now.
Uh?huh, yep.
Right now, who do I call?
So, you ping in the ??
no, look, look, look.
With the existing ??
Exactly.
?Hold on.
?Exactly.
Shut up and listen.
Don't be mad at me
that I understand this
better than you do.
[ Scoffs ]
Look, you're saying
he's got some special way
of getting me in the house
immediately?
No!
No, no, no!
Then they're already
ahead of him.
They have exactly that.
You have to go through
the agent to get...
Listen!
No, you don't.
Guys, guys, agree for
the Sharks to disagree.
Like how any agent
gets into a house
with the other
technology.
They walk up ?? boom ??
they're in the house.
So what you're saying ??
what the agents do,
you can enable
for the consumer to do.
?Absolutely.
?Right, I get that.
Hey, thanks for catching up.
I appreciate it.
Except if you're not
using the agent,
you don't want
to call the agent,
and you want
to make it available...
Corcoran: Right now.
... so that the keys
are right there
and somebody who's comfortable
with keys can use it.
But he can't do that.
Yes, he can!
He doesn't have
a natural advantage there.
Hey, why don't
we agree to disagree?
So, why are
a million lockboxes ??
the traditional
lockboxes ??
why are a million of them
sold a year?
And why does
the other company
have millions of dollars
worth of sales already,
doing exactly this?
All they have to do
is flip one bit and
expand their audience,
and they win.
How do you connect
those boxes?
Good luck, guys.
I wish you luck
getting your money back.
Have a seat, Chris.
We all agree we disagree.
No,
you got it wrong, Chris.
I sometimes wonder how you
made all that money, Mark.
