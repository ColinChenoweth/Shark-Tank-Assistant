My name is Ben,
this is my wife Ariel.
And this is
our daughter Maggie.
Together: And we are
the founders of PupBox.
We're here today
seeking $250,000
in exchange for
10% of our company.
PupBox is changing the way
puppy owners
raise their fur babies.
Nobody anticipates
how difficult and how stressful
bringing a new puppy
into their home can be.
We experienced this
first hand when we adopted
our precious daughter,
Maggie.
See, the problem is that
with so many product options
in the big box stores,
it's hard to find
the best products for
your baby's changing needs.
We created PupBox
to make puppyhood easier
for puppy parents
like ourselves
by delivering everything
a new puppy owner needs
on a monthly basis.
Each month, our subscribers
get a box that includes
five to seven products
that range from toys and treats
to grooming tools
and accessories.
A training guide
is also included
to let you know
what's going on with your puppy
and what you should be
doing to keep up.
Everything is customized
for your puppy's
developmental stage
and physical characteristics.
PupBox will
walk you through
every stage of
your puppy's development.
Through
the potty training blues...
Chewing on shoes...
... and terrible twos.
Give us one second
to pass out samples.
?Oh.
?Oh, my!
?[ Laughs ]
?Ohh!
?You get one.
?Hi, baby!
This one's yours.
This is Ferrari.
Ferrari?
Loves fast cars.
This is D. J.
I see you, little pie!
This is Shanelle.
?That's Mavi.
?Come here, Mavi.
[ Groans ]
Come here, buddy.
I was gonna wear
the same exact tie today.
Mr. Wonderful, that's Cash,
and here's Cash's box.
?Look at you!
?[ Chuckles ]
And are these
therapy dogs?
Um, no not yet, they
could be though, some day.
It's working on the Sharks.
Kevin hasn't said a word.
[ Laughter ]
How much is the box?
So the price range
is from $29 to $39.
It is a subscription.
Per month?
Yeah, per month.
So it's $39
for a one?month
subscription,
$34 for a three?month
subscription.
So, Ben, I want to
write some stuff down
so, uh, I want to lose
Cashflow over here.
Okay.
Bring Cash over here.
?[ Chuckles ]
?All right.
He doesn't want
to be with
the mean Kevin anymore.
?Cashflow, see you later.
He's crazy about me.
Are you kidding?
?Give him to me.
The, uh, average price
paid per month per user
is $30, and that's after
all the discounts.
I'm not sure ?? I've never
had a puppy ??
I've only had cats.
?Ew!
?What do you mean, "Ew?"
Um, I would imagine that
at a certain point in time
they might not need to have
all of these different
training things
or helpful...
Sure.
... um, brochures.
Sure. So we capture them
when they're a puppy,
as early as we can
during puppyhood.
And then once they graduate
from our puppy program,
we roll them over
into an adult box,
which is more of
a discovery box.
Ben, how long
have you been doing it?
So, we've been
doing this for two years.
We've been doing it
full?time for a year.
Um, so far to date, we've done
about $580,000 in sales.
We're on pace to do
$800,000 this year.
So how are you acquiring
customers online?
How would anybody know
about you right now?
Sure.
So our customer acquisition
really revolves around
social media and social sharing.
Because they're puppies,
it's very shareable content.
So we have 75,000 followers
on Instagram.
It really is content gold.
We encourage them
to share pictures online,
so it's really
a snowball effect.
What's your background?
Sure. So I come from
a start?up background.
It was a conference
production business,
but I worked in
content marketing
and business development there.
And Ariel?
And Ariel has over 15 years
of pet experience, so...
I am
all pet industry.
So I've worked in distribution,
manufacturing, import/export,
every single thing
you can imagine.
Ben, what do you think
you'll do next year in sales?
Uh, next year, I think
we'll do about $2.5 million.
We've been growing
at about 10% month over month
for the last year.
So we're projecting that out.
Consistently?
Very consistently.
I'm gonna give you
my puppy back
just so I can
look in your box.
Are you profitable
at $2.5 million?
Yes.
Are you profitable
at $800,000?
At $800,000 a the end of
the year, we will be profitable.
We just reached cash?flow
positive two months ago.
Oh, you did?
Yeah.
I must say, you're strategy of
putting puppies on Sharks' laps
has really taken
the teeth out them.
[ Laughter ]
Look at Cuban.
ever since that dog peed on him.
?He hasn't said a word.
Ever since that
little puppy peed on him,
he hasn't said a word.
?Oh, it's so sweet.
Drool, not pee.
Love the dogs and all that,
but your valuation
is aggressive, I find.
I'll give you $200,000 for 10%
if it gets to $2 million value.
Why is it worth
2 million bucks?
It's not profitable to me.
$2.5 million.
Ben: The numbers
that we're projecting out
for end?of?year this year
and next year
are very reasonable
for us to attain.
And with, you know,
the Sharks' help,
we think we can really
do a lot more ??
Guys, I'll clear
the decks a little bit.
Look, um, thank you for
letting me play with Mavi here.
?Yeah.
?Yeah.
I'm not a big fan of
subscription services.
That's just
a tough business.
I'm out.
?Okay, thank you.
?All right, thank you, Mark.
So, if I say to you, I'll give
you the $200 ?? $250k, right?
?Right.
?I made that small error
when I was writing it down.
?[ Chuckles ]
?You did.
Um...
Math is complicated.
But $250,000 okay for 20%.
I want a Shark discount.
Thank you so much, we really
do appreciate the offer.
?Do, uh, any of ??
?Doesn't sound like
you're jumping all over it.
Uh, I just want to hear if
there's any other Sharks
that want to come in now
for an offer
if you'd like me to ??
I'm somewhat interested. I have
the same issue as Kevin does.
Lately over
the last couple years,
I've gotten into this area,
with TurboPUP,
and I work with
PetSmart and Petco.
Um, I'll give you...
$250,000 for 25%.
Herjavec:
A worse offer.
I just know that
I'm gonna be in this
because I'm passionate about it.
And that's why I have
to add that,
'cause that's purely my time.
All right, Lori, Robert, do you
guys want to weigh in here?
Um, I love it.
Um, evaluation's
aggressive today.
We're aggressive people.
Well, I like that,
but I do think there's
a bit of a premium
for having a Shark on board
and getting a deal.
?I ?? yeah.
?Understood.
I'll give you
$250,000 for 15%.
?Wow.
?Okay, great.
That's definitely
getting better.
It's moving
in the right direction now.
?Do we have a deal?
?Ooh.
?Do we have a deal?
?And he's forcing you
to take the deal right now
before what I have to say.
I would love
to hear from Lori.
Do we have a deal?
Narrator: One Shark is out,
but Ben and Ariel have
three offers for
their subscription box
for puppies ?? PupBox.
Do we have a deal?
I would love
to hear from Lori
if you want to want
to join in the deal.
Um, we'd also love
to get Sharks involved,
so if we could hear from
everyone that would be awesome.
No way in the world
will I get into this deal
with the other Sharks.
They don't bring any value.
The other problem is
getting a Shark out of...
?They don't bring any value?
?Excuse us?
?That's harsh!
?Here's the problem.
All kinds of bad things can
happen the longer you wait.
I was gonna go in on Daymond's
offer if he would've let me.
But you just heard
what he had to say.
Here is ?? Here is why,
I am going to leave my offer
where I'm at because of this ??
?So, let's summarize.
Daymond's offering you
$250,000 for 25%,
I'm far more reasonable,
and you get...
?[ Dog barks ]
?... Mr. Wonderful for 20%
for the $250,000, and then
you get the discount Shark.
I would have gone in with
Daymond if he would've had me.
?And I love the puppies.
?You've got two Sharks
at the 25%,
which is a better value...
What are you
thinking about Lori? Why?
Well, you know that I am expert
at getting things into stores.
Are you gonna give up 25%?
That's ridiculous.
?You know I'm lightning speed.
?No.
So why are you even
letting them talk?
...every pet.
?No, no, I understand.
But I think through influencers
and through social media...
?Ben, $250,000, 15%?
?Mavi, what do you want to do?
I would love to hear
what they have to offer.
They're offering 25%.
Yeah, they're negotiating
with themselves and...
?Here on one second.
?Lori, the only thing...
Are you guys willing
to come down on the 25%?
?Too much noise.
?You don't like my offer?
I want to see if we can get
as many Sharks in a deal.
I don't want to deal
with the other Sharks.
It's not enough equity.
I see this
as an online play.
I have a lot of respect
for Lori, but I wouldn't be
interested in this, and I'll
tell you why I believe that.
O'Leary: So, Lori just got
thrown under the bus.
I believe ?? here's why
I believe my extra 10%
in regards to him
is of more value.
?Well, that's interesting.
?Let me, hold on Rob.
Let me just explain because
I want them to make...
I got to
walk my dogs.
I have a large
amount of relationships
with manufacturers, so the 5%,
I could probably save you 15%
in acquisition of product.
Number 2 is, I have
a very big passion for this.
O'Leary:
I actually speak dog.
You know what
that dog's saying to me?
"Don't do the deal
with Daymond."
That's way too much
equity.
No one's letting Lori speak.
I don't like that.
25% is too much,
and we already have
an offer on the table
for 15%.
They're just
talking over you.
?I know.
?I'm gonna get up in a minute.
I'm gonna go walk my dogs.
?That's what they do
all the time.
?They do. It's horrible.
See, you don't know
that at home.
?You know what, Lori?
?I believe in you guys.
?They can't hear you.
?You want to do a deal
with somebody who has a passion
in cars, money, or pets?
I'm getting up.
All right, you got a deal,
Robert, you got a deal.
[ Dog yelps ]
The puppy screams like a little
girl, it's like he is a puppy.
?There it is.
?That's good.
?He's covered in puppies.
?It's a pleasure, thank you.
?Thank you.
?Yeah, yeah.
?Thank you.
?That was a nice job, guys.
Ben: We're super glad
that we got Robert.
I really wanted to
hear all of the offers out,
but as soon as Daymond and Lori
started talking,
Robert was really
starting to get pushy.
Yeah.
And I mean,
he gave us a fair offer.
He did.
We asked 10%, he offered 15%,
so we couldn't not take it.
Narrator: In Season 6,
we watched
Nick and Elyse Oleksak
make a deal with Lori Greiner
for their cream?cheese stuffed
mini bagel ball company,
Bantam Bagels.
Would you be interested
in 25%?
If you decide
right now with me.
You have a deal.
Let's see what
they're up to now.
Greiner: Hi, guys!
?Hey!
?Hey!
I'm in Seattle today
with Nick and Elyse.
And we are here at Starbucks
headquarters for a big meeting.
Last year, Starbucks
tested us in 400 stores.
And this year,
we're really hoping
they're gonna put us
in a whole lot more.
?Welcome to Starbucks!
?Hi!
Elyse: The journey to get here
hasn't been an easy one.
The outcome of today's meeting
could lay the foundation
for our business,
for our family's future.
I'm trying to be cool,
but I'm really bursting inside.
We felt pretty good coming out
of that first initial test.
We want to discuss, maybe
going to a few more stores.
How about 7,700 stores?
All of our company owned stores
here in the United States.
With this increase in demand,
we are gonna get things going
in Brooklyn.
We have 40 employees,
two shifts, ready to get going
baking mini?stuffed bagels
for everybody.
Nick: Before "Shark Tank,"
we did $200,000 in sales.
Now, two years later,
we've done $13 million in sales.
Welcome to the family!
[ Cheers and applause ]
Having this partnership
with Lori and knowing that
she's there for us
should help us
grow this business to
the size we want it to be.
It's everything
we ever dreamed,
and we're here,
and we're living it.
This is America, the is
the entrepreneurial dream.
Everybody say "Bantam!"
All: Bantam!
Narrator: Next into the tank
is an apparel company
geared towards
an under served market.
[ Dramatic music plays ]
In business, the benefit is
when you do something wrong
and you lose money,
it tells you adjust.
?Right. Right
?You've been doing it
for five years,
you're not making money.
?Right.
?You don't make the product.
You're not a manufacturer.
You're not even a business.
Yes, we are. I'm sorry that
you don't think we are.
You're really not.
With all due respect,
I'm not sure
you're a business person.
I think you're a preacher
in the land of algae.
Okay. [ Laughs ]
And I'm not sure
I want to pray there.
I'm out.
That's okay.
Is there anybody else
in this deal?
Nope.
We're getting there.
I flew out to Bentonville
and talked to Walmart.
?And?
?We didn't quite
get to the price point
we want ??
O'Leary: They didn't like
the 12 bucks, did they?
Correct.
They wanted to retail it
at $4.99.
I too flew
to Bentonville once,
to try and sell
software to them.
The industry priced
all software $39.95.
And I'm doing $350 million
a year at that price.
The price of the computer
was $1,200.
I sat with the buyer,
and he said to me,
"We want to sell
your software for $19.95."
Next week, Walmart
is gonna change the price of PCs
to $999, and our opening order
for you, right here,
is $24 million.
You have 10 minutes
to decide,
your competitor's
waiting outside.
What do you think I did?
You took it.
Exactly.
Our sales grew to
$1 billion that year.
Walmart changed the industry
by pricing at a point
that they understood
would move.
Listen to that story.
Don't be a fool.
How, how old was the company
at that point?
It was in
it's sixth year.
Okay. I'm less than
a year and a half.
But you're a product,
you're not a company yet.
?Let me ask you a question.
?Well, it's going that way.
In a year,
I've developed a brand.
I've people buying
my apparel line,
which I think there's
a great play here to expand in.
?Oh, no, no.
?Don't do that.
This is, this is long?term.
Not now.
I haven't even scratched
the surface with this.
The fact that
you've made them
and sold it to them
is a huge red flag.
