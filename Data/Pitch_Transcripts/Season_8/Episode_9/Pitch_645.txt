Hi. I'm Catharine Arnston.
Um, Catharine ??
Catharine,
what were you asking for?
Catharine,
you forgot something.
Oh, oh, that's right.
I'm looking for $500,000
in exchange for 5%
of my company.
?You forgot that?!
?Oh!
[ Laughter ]
I don't blame you.
This better be good.
Well, you're a very
impressive audience.
Now let's see it.
I liked her more
before we knew the number.
I obviously didn't
have enough this morning.
I guess it didn't
help with your memory
as much as you thought, huh?
So, how do you know
it works, Catharine?
Because, it's been used
for 50 years ??
That doesn't
tell us anything.
Because there are
100,000 studies
that have documented
the ecificy ?? ethicacy...
100,000 studies?
Studies, yes.
Give us one.
Well, I ?? well,
there's one on that fact that...
?Oh, this isn't go well.
?... uh, spirulina contains
aficosinine,
which is a pigment.
Where are you selling,
Catharine?
?Like, what are you doing?
?We've been selling online,
only through our website
for the last six years.
John: Catharine,
why would you do that?
You've seen this before.
You've seen this show
a million times.
Catharine, how did
you get into this?
So, my sister developed
breast cancer,
Catharine, Catharine,
you're on a mission.
But I think there's just
more than a minimal disconnect
from reality.
I'm out.
We've ?? We've never
been to retail before.
?This is a whole new ??
?Catharine, there's
a scary thing about
you're going to retail.
So in your packaging, when you
say things like SKINNYbits,
you're implying that you will
get skinny by eating them.
Catharine:
That's just the name.
We don't claim
about weight loss at all.
It's implied by
calling it a SKINNYbit.
Yeah.
You need to be responsible
that you are not
deceiving the public.
Catharine, what's your biggest
benefit of going bankrupt?
Um, it was a humbling
experience.
Well, that's true.
Okay, Catharine,
thank you very much.
?Good luck, Catharine.
?Thank you.
Thank you for your time.
?Good luck, Catharine.
Goodbye.
Sorry, Sharks.
I did nothing wrong
with the valuation.
The company is growing so fast.
