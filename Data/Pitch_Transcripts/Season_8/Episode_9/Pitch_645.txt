Hey, Sharks,
I'm Hunter.
And I'm Alex.
We're from Las Vegas, Nevada.
Our company is Barbell Apparel,
and we're seeking $500,000
for 5% of our business.
?Wow.
?Whoa.
We're redefining clothing
for athletic body types.
Hunter and I grew up
living an active lifestyle.
We've played sports,
we lifted weights.
We're doing anything to get us
into the great outdoors.
But as you can imagine,
with a booty like this
and thighs like that,
we could never
find clothing that fits.
[ Laughs ]
So we decided to create
a line of athletic?fit denim,
chinos, and shorts,
tailored to fit
muscular legs.
Using high?tech fabrics,
military grade stitching,
and a fit tailored
for active bodies,
our clothing will keep you
moving in 360 degree comfort
no matter what your day
throws at you.
Alex, let's show these
Sharks what you've got.
In normal jeans,
I can barely sit down.
With our jeans,
there are no limits.
[ Grunts ]
[ Lori laughs ]
Now, who wouldn't want clothing
that can move like that?
Athletes work hard
for their strong, meaty thighs
and want
to be proud of them.
Our clothing keeps them
comfortable, moving freely,
and most importantly,
feeling great about themselves.
So, Sharks, who wants to
take a chance...
Together: With our pants?
[ Laughs ]
We have samples to pass out,
and we're happy
to answer any questions.
Uh, can we answer
the question about
why you're worth
$10 million dollars?
Wow, we're going
right there.
?Yeah, let's go there.
?Straight in, straight in.
?Hold on, hold on, hold on.
?Let's get the goods.
Because I guarantee you
it's coming up.
Yeah, yeah.
Is this a lot of Lycra?
Yeah, it's 1% spandex.
All right, Kevin,
what was your question?
Let's go right there.
?My question is very simple.
You better have a ton of sales
to justify this evaluation
in the clothing industry.
?Well, stop.
I want to just
get to this really quick.
Why can't we talk
about sales, Daymond?
Because I like ??
I want to be ab??
You don't have
a 32 inch waist!
?I want to be romanced.
?Are you kidding me?
?Yeah.
?Okay, let's ??
Kevin,
ask your question.
Tell me what your sales
are gonna be this year.
$2.3 million.
?$2.3 million?
?Wow.
?Yes.
?And you think
you're worth
five times revenue?
Cuban: That's not
the real question.
The real question is,
what's your growth rate?
Our growth rate
currently is around 100%.
Per year, so you expect
to do $3.4 million
give or take, next year?
Yeah, $3 million
to $4 million.
Where are the clothes
being sold?
100% online.
Where have you
done these sales?
So we founded on Kickstarter,
in, uh, March of 2014.
And so, um, I married my wife
in spring of 2014,
and because
the business was struggling,
we were on our honeymoon,
and I was staying
at a friend's house 'cause we
didn't have money for a hotel.
And it was late night,
on the laptop,
finishing up the details,
and we had a goal of $15,000.
And I was just hoping
we would meet our goal
over the 45?day campaign.
And I went
to bed that night,
and I woke up and there was
already $80,000 funded.
?Good for you.
?$80,000?
?Yeah.
?Wow.
We had hit our goal
in 40 minutes.
I have to admit,
I thought every niche
of the denim market
was covered.
?[ Chuckles ]
?I have never heard of this.
?I really applaud you.
?That first Kickstarter,
by the way, went on
to fund over $735,000.
?What?!
?You did $735,000
on Kickstarter?
?You did $735,000?
?Yeah.
?On a percentage basis,
I'm gonna assume
that a healthy denim company
can make 15% pre?tax, right?
Our margins are
a little bit better.
Our gross profit on
last year's $1.1 million
was around $700,000.
What do you think you'll do
on this year's $2.3 million?
Our gross should be
around $1.5 million.
Is that after
you've paid yourselves?
?Um, no but we've ??
?That's impressive, guys.
An investor has to know
your getting paid
and all the employees.
If you normalized all that,
what are you gonna make?
Free cash flow for this
year should be around
half a million dollars.
Good for you.
Did we ever ask
how much the jeans are?
They retail for $149.
That's not bad.
And what's your cost for them?
Between 15 and 20 bucks.
?Wow.
?Oh, wow.
Do you have a problem
with inventory?
We do. A bad one.
Yeah.
Uh, the problem is that
we sell the stuff so fast,
we don't have the cash
to buy a couple...
To take a risk.
... to kind of ease it up.
And that's
why we're here,
because we need a Shark
to help us
get over
our inventory hurdle,
so we can get ahead of the curve
and actually meet the dema??
Hunter, I know this
business pretty well.
It's a management
of inventory business.
It's very, very tough.
And it sucks cash
like there is no tomorrow.
And I'm not saying you can't ??
?You said it, brother.
Yeah. I'm not saying
you can't fix it,
but at a $10 million valuation,
started as an investor...
I mean, you guys are from Vegas.
You're asking me
to roll the dice.
And I like to gamble,
but under this valuation,
it's too big a risk right now.
Do you want me to tell you
what you're worth today?
What you'd get in the private
equity market valuation?
I'm sure
you're gonna tell us.
[ Laughter ]
?We're ready, we're ready.
?I know you need to know it.
And thank goodness I'm here.
I think, if you could actually
get a private equity firm
to invest pre?money at
$5 million, you're a rock star.
I don't think you could,
but if you could,
that would be the max.
?I think??
?We're here to negotiate, so...
We're here to make a deal.
Like, like I said,
we're good at what we do, but we
know the value you guys bring.
So, let me tell you
what I think about it.
I have 15 clothing brands,
all right?
And, um,
12 of them are dead.
The reason why I still invest
in apparel business is
they have to have
a couple criteria.
I want it to be somewhere
in the sports and athleticism,
but not denim.
I want it to be somebody
who has to buy
a new pair of shoes
every three months
or they've been doing yoga
and they have to buy
a new pair of spandex
every three months.
Denim, the more damage it gets,
the cooler it is, right?
So, you don't get to re?sell
that type of stuff in my world.
?Yeah.
?Yeah.
The last thing I want to do
right now is denim, so I'm out.
Guys, I just want to point out,
on an after?tax basis
for a clothing company,
you're asking 30 times.
Yeah, but none are growing
as fast as they are.
Yeah, but that is
an extraordinary multiple.
It's not the multiple
that's the issue with me, guys.
The issue is, it's hard
to create barriers to entry.
The minute someone says, "Dang,
but Barbell is killing it,
I love their clothes,
but I can't get them,"
then that creates opportunity
for somebody else.
I'm not saying you're
not gonna be successful.
Look, 99.99%
of entrepreneurs in this world,
if you told them they could have
$500,000 net cash flow
after paying themselves,
would cut off their hand
to get it.
So you guys are
doing amazing things.
The question is how you overcome
not being able to protect it.
I'm out.
Thank you,
we appreciate your time.
?Yeah, thank you, Mark.
?And congratulations, guys.
You guys, listen,
I give you serious props
for what you've done.
Getting into this industry
is hard as can be.
And you guys actually
created something new.
Where I don't think there's
been anything new in forever.
But I can't see where
this would be an investment
that's right for me,
so I'm out.
But like I said,
serious props to you guys.
?Thank you very much.
?Thank you, Lori.
Guys, um,
the inventory scares me.
If I was ever gonna
get into jeans,
it would be
the two of you guys ??
I'll tell you this,
before you go any further,
is that we are ?? we are good
at inventory projection.
I know what I'm gonna sell.
I just need to be able
to buy it.
And we have great
manufacturing terms.
We're really good
at sourcing,
and we can get our lead times
down as low as six weeks.
Yeah, Hunter,
I can't get there.
It's just more inventory,
more money.
You guys are great operators,
and that's
the greatest compliment
I can give somebody
as an entrepreneur.
Inventory scares me.
I'm out.
?I understand.
?Yeah.
So, guys, who can downplay
or even suggest you guys
haven't done a phenomenal job
in such a brutally
competitive space.
I mean, that's what it is.
But this thing's
gonna inhale cash,
it's not gonna be
a very liquid situation for us.
?Yeah, that's the problem.
?It'll exhale cash, too.
With our margins,
it's gonna be
one of the best investments
you ever had.
It will, but it will
inhale cash,
as every
clothing industry does.
As Mark said,
it'll exhale cash, too.
It's a very difficult deal.
I'm gonna pass.
I'm out.
I think the lesson,
and we've all learned it
together here today,
this is not Las Vegas.
$500,000 is a ton of money.
Had you asked for less,
you'd probably be
walking out with a Shark.
Good luck.
?Well, thank you guys very much.
?All right, guys.
?We appreciate it.
?Thank you guys.
?It was a pleasure.
?Thank you guys.
Hunter: It was very frustrating
to hear the Sharks say
that they wanted to invest but
get super hung up on the money.
?And inventory.
?You know because there's ??
it's not actually
that much money,
especially when we're like at
a $2.3 million run rate.
Well, that's the lesson.
People come in here
with these huge numbers.
It's an all?in thing.
Why risk half a million bucks
in an industry that ??
it's just
full of dead bones?
Even big brands.
The big brands are dying,
trust me.
