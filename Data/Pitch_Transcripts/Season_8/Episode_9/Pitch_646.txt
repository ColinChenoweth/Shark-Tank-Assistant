My name is Vance Zahorski,
and I live with my two daughters
and my wife
with my parents
in Hudson, Wisconsin.
Every minute of every day,
I think about fishing.
It's been ingrained in my blood
since I was 4 years old.
My product takes one of the most
over?looked inconveniences
of fishing and completely
cuts it out.
Brush those pearly whites.
When my wife agreed
to go all in,
I gave up a six?figure job,
we sold our dream house,
and moved into
my parent's house ??
the same bedroom that I lived in
when I was going to high school.
Couple more boxes here.
I'm the definition
of a one?man band.
I've driven from
Rhode Island to California.
I handle shipping, packaging.
Luckily, I've got
my family to support me,
and they help out when they can,
which has been
a key to my success.
[ Groans ] Grab one.
From the moment
I came up with my idea,
I've thought about "Shark Tank."
I've played out
the role in my head,
and every step that
I've taken has been with
getting a deal with a Shark.
And now I'm right at that point.
I'm so close.
[ Dramatic music plays ]
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Vance Zahorski,
and I'm seeking $120,000
for 20% equity stake
in my company ??
Line Cutterz.
Line Cutterz is
a fisherman's best friend.
Now, I've been fishing
since I was 4 years old
on my grandpa's dock
in Wisconsin.
So fishing's in my blood.
I was fishing at my friend's
wedding in Florida
and accidentally caught
a 3?foot blacktip shark.
When I got it on to the beach,
it thrashed around and got
tangled up in my line.
I needed to cut it free quick.
So I ran up to my tackle box
to grab my knife,
and it had fallen in the sand.
I stepped on it
and almost cut off my toe.
At that moment,
I had had enough.
I was absolutely
sick and tired
of dealing with the same old
rusty fingernail clippers
and dangerous knives
just to cut line.
I've even chipped my teeth
biting line the old?school way.
Twice!
?[ Chuckles ]
I thought, "Why not just
put a cutter on your finger?"
So I busted out
some welding putty,
broke apart
a dental?floss cutter,
and handmade my first prototype.
The very first
Line Cutter's ring.
When I slipped it on my finger
and effortlessly cut,
it felt like I got
struck by lightning.
I had figured out a way
to cut fishing line
faster, safer,
and more conveniently
than any other cutter out there.
I knew it was
a million?dollar idea.
Now, in just over a year,
we have done $280,000.
I got to show you
how this works.
This is 12?pound?test
monofilament line.
Pretty popular for
catching sunny and bass.
[ Gasps ]
This is 30?pound?test
fluorocarbon.
30?, 50?, 60?pound fish
is what you catch with that.
50?pound braided nylon.
You can't bite this
with your teeth.
All right, let's get crazy.
This is 100?pound test braided
nylon fishing line.
You can catch 200? and 300?pound
shark with this line.
?That's crazy!
?Stop the madness!
I can't cut my skin
with it either.
And the best part is,
the fishing industry's
just he beginning.
So, Sharks,
who wants Line Cutterz
to cut you loose to make
some reel [real] money?
?Can we see them?
?Wow.
?Absolutely.
?Great presentation.
?Could we have a sample?
?So I made special rings
for each one of you.
Lori, I've got
a bedazzled ring for you.
?Bedazzled!
?Bedazzled!
My Polish brother,
the white Polish eagle.
Uh, Croatia.
Croatian.
Oh, I'm sorry, Croatian.
?I can't wear this!
?[ Laughs ]
Yep, deal's over.
Daymond, the most fashionable
Shark, my favorite ring.
He is not
the most fashionable.
And, Mark, I got a custom
Dallas ring just for you.
That's what's up, baby.
O'Leary: So, you teased us
a little bit saying
the fishing industry's
just he beginning.
What other plans
do you have for the ring cutter?
So, it just so happens
that this ring works perfectly
for cutting thread, yarn,
and embroidery floss.
This one one single SKU
works in two
multi?billion?dollar industries.
How much does it cost?
All right, so the ring by itself
costs about $1.68 per unit.
?For you to make?
?Correct.
I sell it for $12 retail.
?Wow.
?And I have 150 stores
that I'm in currently.
Cuban: And what's your
wholesale to them?
Wholesale to them is $6.00.
We're 70% margin.
What about the big box guys
in outdoors?
Keep in mind,
we're less than 17 months old.
But, Vance, you have enough
margin to sell it for that.
What was the issue?
Here's the challenge.
So, I'm a young company.
If I do that and I upset
all the dealers that I'm in,
and I'm picking up
dealers regularly,
and then Walmart
pulls the plug on me
and I've upset all my dealers...
Good for you. Smart.
...I've got a really good
margin, I've got ??
Vance, I want
to tell you a story,
and I want you
to listen hard, okay?
?Oh, Lord, here we go.
?Oh, God.
'Cause I think
you're gonna appreciate it.
Vance, I think you're
gonna get knocked off.
My dad loved fishing.
He actually had a product
that was similar to this.
He had a ring,
he put it on his pinky,
and it was like
a little mini?sickle.
He cut line all the time
'cause I always got it tangled.
But mostly, I can't
do a deal with you,
'cause you thought
I was Polish and not Croatian.
[ Laughter ]
So...
?Damn you!
?I caught it.
?Damn you!
?It was your parents,
Polish immigrants.
?Yeah, I'm out.
Vance, let me simplify it.
I'm not a fisherman.
You know, anybody
who goes into clothing
when they're just getting
started always scares me.
It's not really a fit
for me, so I'm out.
Well, I'm sorry to hear that,
but thank you for your time.
What are you gonna do
with the money?
Okay, so the $120,000
is gonna split in pretty much
key categories ??
marketing, inventory,
and then I need help.
Like, I'm running two companies,
I did the website.
Those displays are built by me.
I cut off a Halloween arm,
cut the bloody stump off,
painted them silver.
[ Laughter ]
The, the signs ??
I like this guy.
?Listen.
?All right.
I'll give you $120,000 for 40%.
?That's ?? That's a...
?Steep
... a really good offer.
?Ooh.
I really appreciate it.
Um, if you don't mind,
I'd like to hear
if there's any other offers.
I really appreciate that offer.
?Kevin's left, Lori's left.
I, um, I'm gonna make
things easy for you.
I didn't like the Walmart
answer, as you know.
I think you should
reconsider that.
That's a ?? that's a very large
distribution partner.
Are you sure you want to wait
till he finishes what he says
When you're talking to a guy
who's an avid fisherman
and somebody who sews?
I can help you,
or you can piss me off.
?I know.
?He has a point.
And I'm gonna cut
this in half for you.
Are you sure you want to go
down that road with him?
Because it may change
after that.
Narrator: Two Sharks are out,
and Vance has one offer
on the table from Daymond
for his fishing line cutter,
Line Cutterz.
However, he may
jeopardize the offer
by listening
to the other Sharks.
Are you sure you want to go
down that road with him?
Because it may change
after that.
I can go two ways.
I can say I'm out and make it
easy for you to get a deal,
or you can piss me off,
and I'll drop this price
in half.
You can say you're out,
and then I'm gonna go for 49%
because he had to
second guess me.
No, no, no, look.
I'm kind of indifferent.
I'd be happy
to screw you up.
On the other hand,
I'm a nice guy, sometimes.
Are you sure?
I've come a long way
and given up a lot.
I'd just like to hear
if there's any other offers.
Uh, I have
no interest, I'm out.
Lori, you're still
in the game, or are you?
I think it's genius.
I really like it.
And I really like you.
But if Walmart is offering you
a deal, that's a huge deal.
I think you should be
very careful
about not rejecting
a great offer.
And even more scary to me
is holding too high
of a price point
where someone can
undercut you so severely
that they'll
just kill your sales.
So, anyway, love you,
but I'm out.
?So, who's left?
?You're left with Daymond
with $120,000 at 40%.
The problem is ??
The problem is
in a negotiation,
you become more valuable
the less amount of people
are in the room, all right?
And you took a chance,
and you...
?Ooh.
?You're gonna make him pay
a horrible price.
?Daymond, is the tide shifting?
Ooh.
Well, I was open,
but because I've become
more valuable, instead of
raising the price on you,
that's gonna be my final
offer, without a counter.
Take it or leave it.
Daymond, is there be any chance
you would take 25%
for $120,000 dollars?
I don't think you just
heard what I said.
You would've had that shot
two Sharks ago.
I just wanted to hear
some advice ??
I understand
what you're saying.
But now I'm the only person
in the room with you.
If you and I start
as partners and I ask for 40%,
that means I'm coming
with the heat.
Cuban: Just remember,
60% of a watermelon
is a whole lot better
than 100% of a grape.
I understand, and I have fought
and clawed my way here.
And to give up 40%
is ?? is just ??
I would've gotten
an investor right away.
I'm literally ??
I've given everything.
And you were one of the Sharks
I came in wanting
to do a deal with.
I think we can both
make a lot of money.
Um, just 40% is...
?Then make him a counter.
?He did.
25% for $120,000.
O'Leary: But he doesn't
want that counter.
We just launched on Amazon.
I'm telling you,
this thing is just about ??
I've done all the work.
It's just it's about to blow up.
?Oh, you don't know the work
that's ahead of you,
which I think I will enjoy.
Herjavec: Vance, it's not
selling time, it's closing time.
I'm not going
to counter on it.
I need to know
that you believe in me,
and I will believe in you.
?Vance, what are you gonna do?
I'm not gonna
take advantage of you.
He has no flexibility.
What are you gonna do?
You've got 15 seconds
to answer me.
Would you do 28%?
You have 15 seconds
to answer me.
30%?
You have 10 seconds
to answer me.
I can't do it.
Go to 1/3, just try it.
I can't.
33%?
Okay.
Yes!
[ Laughter ]
Yes!
You are one of the guys
I wanted!
Thank you.
Thank you.
?Congratulations, man.
?Yes!
?Thank you so much.
?All right, man.
?Congratulations.
?Oh, wow.
Whoo!
Yes!
Mwah, mwah, mwah,
mwah, mwah, mwah.
Oh, my gosh!
It's insane.
I've dreamt about this
moment for two years.
I've thought about
what just happened.
And it just happened
right this freaking second.
We got a deal!
[ <i>Screaming</i> ]
[ <i>Laughs</i> ]
With Daymond.
Yeah.
I can't believe it.
Yeah.
