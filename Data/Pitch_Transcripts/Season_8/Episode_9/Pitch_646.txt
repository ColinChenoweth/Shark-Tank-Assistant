My name is Vance Zahorski,
My name is Vance Zahorski,
But, Vance, you have enough
margin to sell it for that.
What was the issue?
Here's the challenge.
So, I'm a young company.
Vance, I want
to tell you a story,
Vance, I think you're
gonna get knocked off.
My dad loved fishing.
He actually had a product
that was similar to this.
He had a ring,
he put it on his pinky,
Vance, let me simplify it.
I'm not a fisherman.
You know, anybody
who goes into clothing
when they're just getting
started always scares me.
It's not really a fit
for me, so I'm out.
Well, I'm sorry to hear that,
but thank you for your time.
What are you gonna do
with the money?
Okay, so the $120,000
is gonna split in pretty much
key categories ??
Narrator: Two Sharks are out,
and Vance has one offer
on the table from Daymond
for his fishing line cutter,
Line Cutterz.
However, he may
jeopardize the offer
by listening
to the other Sharks.
Are you sure you want to go
down that road with him?
Because it may change
after that.
I can go two ways.
Herjavec: Vance, it's not
selling time, it's closing time.
I'm not going
to counter on it.
I need to know
that you believe in me,
and I will believe in you.
?Vance, what are you gonna do?
I'm not gonna
take advantage of you.
He has no flexibility.
What are you gonna do?
You've got 15 seconds
to answer me.
Would you do 28%?
You have 15 seconds
to answer me.
30%?
You have 10 seconds
to answer me.
I can't do it.
Go to 1/3, just try it.
I can't.
33%?
Okay.
Yes!
[ Laughter ]
Yes!
You are one of the guys
I wanted!
Thank you.
Thank you.
?Congratulations, man.
?Yes!
?Thank you so much.
?All right, man.
?Congratulations.
?Oh, wow.
Whoo!
Yes!
Mwah, mwah, mwah,
mwah, mwah, mwah.
Oh, my gosh!
It's insane.
I've dreamt about this
moment for two years.
I've thought about
what just happened.
