Hi. I'm Catharine Arnston.
And I'm from
Boston, Massachusetts.
And I'm the founder
and C. E. O. of ENERGYbits.
Sharks, you want more energy,
better health, slow aging?
Throw away those
energy drinks and bars
and get your energy naturally
by going down to
the bottom of the food chain.
I'm talking algae!
ENERGYbits are tiny algae
tablets that give you energy,
increase your focus,
satisfy your hunger,
they increase athletic
performance, and speed recovery.
All for one calorie per tab
and all from one ingredient ??
algae!
No, algae's not pond scum ??
well, actually, ha, it is.
[ Laughter ]
But it's also a superfood.
[ Laughs ]
Hey, algae isn't even new!
It's been used in Asia
for 50 years, where it's
a multi?billion?dollar industry.
And it can be even bigger here.
Sharks, we've been selling
our algae for six years.
Doubling sales
almost every year.
I'd love to have you join us
as an investor
because we have
an exciting future.
Would you like to take a look?
Um, Catharine ??
Catharine,
what were you asking for?
Catharine,
you forgot something.
Oh, oh, that's right.
I'm looking for $500,000
in exchange for 5%
of my company.
?You forgot that?!
?Oh!
[ Laughter ]
I don't blame you.
This better be good.
Well, you're a very
impressive audience.
Now let's see it.
I liked her more
before we knew the number.
I obviously didn't
have enough this morning.
I guess it didn't
help with your memory
as much as you thought, huh?
This is energy bits,
and on the other side
are recovery bits.
?Lori.
?Thank you.
?Lori.
?This packaging
hasn't come back
from China yet.
Okay, so do I want
one of each of these?
Yeah, yeah.
Now, can you eat these
all at the same time?
Absolutely.
I'm going with the SKINNYbits.
I'm not an energy guy.
Take some recovery.
I love the taste of it.
30 is a serving.
You need 30 to feel any energy.
?But it's very quiet energy.
?30?
?30's the whole packet?
?Yes.
I'm supposed to eat
the whole package?
Well, we recommend people
swallow them, but yes.
?You don't chew it?
?No, you don't chew it.
?Well, I wouldn't recommend ??
?No, don't chew it.
?Oh.
?Oh, this is nasty!
?I love the taste of it.
?You got to swallow
all 30 of these?
?You do?
?Yes.
?I love the taste of them.
Actually, they go down
very easily.
?A lot of people add them to ??
?I wish you'd said to me,
"Don't chew them."
[ Laughter ]
It tastes like when I look at
the scum on top of the lake,
if I would lick that scum.
[ Laughs ]
Yeah, but wait,
wait, wait, wait.
I'm looking at the ingredients.
?It tastes like kibbles.
There's only one ingredient.
There's only one ingredient.
It's just algae.
There is nothing else in it.
No, but in terms
of the nutrition.
ENERGYbits and SKINNYbits
are actually the same,
just different branding.
RECOVERYbits
are a different algae.
SKINNYbits, ENERGYbits,
RECOVERYbits...
?Yes.
?... all the same thing
inside the package?
?No, no.
RECOVERYbits are chlorella.
There are two algaes.
One is called chlorella.
And that builds your
immune system, pulls out toxins,
including lactic acid, which is
why the athletes take it.
ENERGYbits is spirulina.
And that's algae
provides you with
energy, focus, um,
satisfies your hunger.
So, how do you know
it works, Catharine?
Because, it's been used
for 50 years ??
That doesn't
tell us anything.
Because there are
100,000 studies
that have documented
the ecificy ?? ethicacy...
100,000 studies?
Studies, yes.
Give us one.
Well, I ?? well,
there's one on that fact that...
?Oh, this isn't go well.
?... uh, spirulina contains
aficosinine,
which is a pigment.
And it has been documented
to reverse the growth
of tumors in cancer.
So all doctors, all cancer
doctors, all oncologists ??
Virtually no medical,
none of the medical community
really knows anything about it.
So, they don't know
how to read studies,
is what you're saying?
Where are you selling,
Catharine?
?Like, what are you doing?
?We've been selling online,
only through our website
for the last six years.
What do you sell them for,
and what do you ??
$115 for a bag.
For a bag?
How about a package?
A package is $4.
What's your cost
on a package or a bag?
$40 all in for a bag.
And uh, a ??
For a large bag?
For a large bag.
?How many in a bag?
Uh, 1,000.
What are your sales?
Uh, well, our lifetime
sales are $1.5 million.
[ Scoffs ]
?Oh, my God.
?A whole million, huh?
Hang on, over 6 years,
you've sold 1.5 million?
?Yes.
?What did you sell last year?
Uh, about $300,000.
Have you made any money?
Every single penny
goes back into them.
I'm always redoing things.
?Got it.
I'm always revamping,
I'm always learning
how to do something
better, faster.
So, why is it worth
$10 million?
John: Catharine,
why would you do that?
You've seen this before.
You've seen this show
a million times.
If go to a horror movie
and I see a black person in it,
I know that they're
gonna die first, right?
You know know
they're gonna die first.
You know already what
we're gonna do to you.
Why would you do that?
What I want you to understand is
what's different about us
is that we have created
the first mainstream brand
for algae.
?Branded, right.
?You're a branding company.
We are the first ?? we are
a branding company.
Catharine, how did
you get into this?
So, my sister developed
breast cancer,
and her oncologist told her
she should change her diet.
So after helping her
research the foods,
I started learning more
about plant?based nutrition.
And I thought, "My God!"
This was like 8 years ago.
This needs to get
out to America.
So I went back to school,
I studied nutrition,
and I stumbled across algae.
And found out it's been
sold in America for 50 years,
but it's never caught on.
And I thought, "What's wrong?
Why don't ?? why doesn't
America know about algae?"
Because it's ??
?Maybe because it didn't work?
No, it's because it's never
been branded properly.
Oh!
So I'll tell you.
So I started.
I spent two years
doing all the research.
I went through bankruptcy.
I was in foreclosure
for three years.
I had my car repossessed,
my lights turned off five times.
I suffered
every single embarrassment,
financial ruin that
you can possibly imagine.
And I am unstoppable,
'cause I ?? You know what ??
if you guys don't invest,
that's okay.
Because I am going
to be a [bleep]
[ Laughter ]
?I like you now.
?Catherine.
?Now I like her now.
?You get brownie points now.
I'm going to be
a fantastic success!
?Too many ENERGYbits.
?Because this is ??
The world needs this stuff.
And America doesn't want
to take algae
unless you package it
in a way ??
That makes me more excited about
investing it, you know that?
How many more years will you
keep going, losing money,
before you take this up
behind the barn and shoot it?
Well, this is
our pivotal year.
This is ?? this is the year.
Next year, we're gonna blow up.
If you don't
make money this year,
we're gonna
stop doing this, right?
No, no.
I'm never gonna stop.
Listen, think about
what you're saying.
I think the mistake
in your presentation
is not your passion.
You're gonna have
a very hard time, anywhere,
getting around this
$10 million valuation.
I don't think it's worth
$500,000 ?? the whole company.
Because you don't make
any money and you have
a non?proprietary commodity
that you package.
I'm sorry, I'm out.
This is my joy.
This is my mission.
This is my life.
I?I will do this
for the next 20 years.
You know the definition
of insanity, right?
Yeah, doing
the same thing over
and expecting
a different outcome.
Right. Look, I've had
my lights turned off.
I've had to turn off my phone
because of the bill collectors.
We all
go through it, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But you keep on doing
the same thing over and over ??
No, I'm not. We're now
going to retail.
Catharine, Catharine,
you're on a mission.
But I think there's just
more than a minimal disconnect
from reality.
I'm out.
We've ?? We've never
been to retail before.
?This is a whole new ??
?Catharine, there's
a scary thing about
you're going to retail.
So in your packaging, when you
say things like SKINNYbits,
you're implying that you will
get skinny by eating them.
Catharine:
That's just the name.
We don't claim
about weight loss at all.
It's implied by
calling it a SKINNYbit.
Yeah.
You need to be responsible
that you are not
deceiving the public.
And that you have claims
in which to back that up.
Yeah.
I'm out.
That's okay.
And I think
you should be careful.
John:
Is this good for everybody?
Could somebody be
allergic to it?
Can somebody get sick?
Well, everybody buys product
liability insurance, number one.
So you have that?
Well, we don't have it, no,
because we haven't
been able to afford it.
[ Laughter ]
Whoops.
And I agree with you,
it is challenging.
Um, I'm out.
That's okay.
Thank you for your feedback.
Catharine, what's your biggest
benefit of going bankrupt?
Um, it was a humbling
experience.
Well, that's true.
Okay, Catharine,
thank you very much.
?Good luck, Catharine.
?Thank you.
Thank you for your time.
?Good luck, Catharine.
Goodbye.
Sorry, Sharks.
I did nothing wrong
with the valuation.
The company is growing so fast.
And we have
so many opportunities
coming our way so quickly.
I don't need
to convince anybody.
If they can't see it,
then that's ??
that's unfortunate for them.
It's not unfortunate for me,
because I have
a growing business.
