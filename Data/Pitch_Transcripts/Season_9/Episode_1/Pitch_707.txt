Hi, Sharks.
My name's Carson Kropfl.
This is my friend Sierra.
Hi, Sharks!
Hi, Sierra.
Hi, Sierra.
Hi, Sierra.
I'm his mom, Carrie,
Wow, Carson.
Love the hair.
?Thanks.
?Thank you.
Very cool.
Thank you, Sharks.
Bye.
Bye!
Good job, Sierra.
Bye, SiSi.
Great job.
Oh, that's cool.
[ Sharks chuckle ]
Sharks, the benefit of you
investing in my company
is that you'll be a part
of something
that has been inspiring
people all over the world.
I've been surfing with sharks
since I was 5 years old,
so go ahead,
hit me with some questions.
[ Laughter ]
Herjavec: All right.
Normally, a skateboard's
this big, is it?
Or...
Uh, yes.
Is this the first time anyone's
ever cut it down to size?
It's the only skateboard
that fits inside a backpack.
But I've seen
small ones before.
What's unique about it?
Uh, they're good
for the planet,
So, is Sierra your girlfriend?
[ Laughs ]
No.
[ Laughter ]
What kind of look
was that?
Herjavec: Wow!
What will you do with the money
if somebody puts it up?
Manufacturing,
upgrading my website,
So, Carson, you said
that you had gotten
some help to make these 'cause
you can't make them anymore.
What's your deal with them?
Madrid Skateboards,
How do I know there isn't
a Carson in New Jersey
doing the same thing?
You kill it, Carson!
Bam!
?Drop the mic!
?Buh?bam!
?Bam!
?Bam!
[ Laughter ]
Listen, you're amazing.
But I'm not going to invest
in the company.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Carson, where do you want
to be a year from now,
two years from now,
five years from now?
I want to be...
everywhere.
[ Light laughter ]
That's a lot of places.
He sound?? He sounds
like one of us.
What's been amazing,
online's great
because he has
much higher profit margins,
but he'd also like
to be in retailers
because it does give him
a lot of credibility.
Right now, he's in
a Southern California retailer,
Jack's Surfboards.
He's in two of their stores.
You know, here's what I think.
You know, I would not invest
in your company now
because I think that you have
so much growth,
Cuban: Carson,
I love what you're doing.
I want to make you an offer.
Okay?
I'll give you the $60,000,
but I want 20%.
For 20%?
So Carson, I'm...
Robert?
[ Chuckles ]
?Great job, Carson.
?Great deal.
Good job, Carson!
Good job, Carrie.
?Good job.
?Thank you.
?Congrats.
?Thank you so much.
[ Hushed voice ] Yes!
[ Hushed voice ] Wow!
You know,
wanting to do everything,
that really hits home, I think,
with all of us.
It's contradictory to, of
course, what everyone's taught.
I mean, I think about when we
started the show nine years ago.
That's the biggest change.
As I go around
the country...
Yeah.
Cuban: All about the kids.
...half the people that
come up to me are kids.
It's all about the kids,
yeah.
Yeah.
Sierra Madre Research.
We're here to offer
15% of our company
in exchange for $175,000.
At some point in life,
most of us have
the fantastic idea
to embark
on a camping trip.
Sierra Madre Research...
[ Laughter ]
...is a solution?driven
outdoor gear company
would like to join
Sierra Madre Research
in elevating
the camping experience
around the world?
?[ Chuckles ]
?Great job, guys.
But wait.
Before we get started,
for their hammock tent company,
Sierra Madre.
I really like your product.
But for me,
believing in the entrepreneur
is the most important thing.
