Hi, Sharks.
My name's Carson Kropfl.
I'm an 11?year?old inventor,
skater, and surfer.
This is my friend Sierra.
Hi, Sharks!
Hi, Sierra.
Hi, Sierra.
Hi, Sierra.
I'm his mom, Carrie,
and we're from
San Clemente, California.
I am seeking $60,000
for 15% of my company.
You just saw
my first invention.
It's called Streetubez.
It lets riders surf anywhere,
any time,
because it looks and feels like
you're totally getting tubed.
My second invention was when
I first started middle school,
and it was the first time
I ever had a locker.
My locker was decked out
and awesome,
but none of my skateboards
would fit in it,
so I decided, "What the heck?
Why not just make
one of my own?"
This is a Locker Board.
Locker Boards are handmade
and reshaped from recycled
skateboard decks.
At only 16 inches long,
they fit easily inside
of backpacks and lockers.
And they're good
for the planet.
Thanks, Mom.
Let's pass out some samples.
Robert, get on the board.
[ Laughing ]
I'm gonna get on the board.
Thank you.
Great.
Thank you.
Wow, Carson.
Love the hair.
?Thanks.
?Thank you.
Very cool.
Thank you, Sharks.
Bye.
Bye!
Good job, Sierra.
Bye, SiSi.
Great job.
Oh, that's cool.
[ Sharks chuckle ]
Sharks, the benefit of you
investing in my company
is that you'll be a part
of something
that has been inspiring
people all over the world.
I've been surfing with sharks
since I was 5 years old,
so go ahead,
hit me with some questions.
[ Laughter ]
Herjavec: All right.
Normally, a skateboard's
this big, is it?
Or...
Uh, yes.
Is this the first time anyone's
ever cut it down to size?
It's the only skateboard
that fits inside a backpack.
But I've seen
small ones before.
What's unique about it?
Uh, they're good
for the planet,
easy to take anywhere,
and they're super fun to ride.
And also, the square shape
lets you still do tricks
'cause of the corners,
and your feet can stay on it
and it won't be too wobbly.
Where are you getting
the old boards from?
Vans skateboards has a monthly
recycling program for me
at two
of their skate parks,
and I get about 50 boards
a month from them.
And they give them to you, or,
right now, you're buying them?
Give them to me.
Are you selling any today?
For nine months,
I've been selling
all over the country.
How are you selling it
across the country?
Online?
Social media.
Really?
He's made $10,000 in revenue
since he started.
So, is Sierra your girlfriend?
[ Laughs ]
No.
[ Laughter ]
What kind of look
was that?
Herjavec: Wow!
What will you do with the money
if somebody puts it up?
Manufacturing,
upgrading my website,
buying trucks and wheels,
hardware, in bulk.
How many skateboards
have you sold?
I have sold 231.
What does it cost you
to make one?
So, the deck costs me $3,
but now Vans put me in touch
with their manufacturer,
Madrid Skateboards,
so that costs $13,
and I'm now selling them
for $52.
Wholesale.
Wow.
Wholesale.
?Wholesale.
?Retail, what's the price?
$99.
Where do you make it now?
My husband set up a shop
for him,
and he's been making them
in the backyard.
Branson: I remember
when I started in business,
my headmaster called me
into the study and said,
"Look, you either leave school
and you run your business
or you stay at school and
you don't run your business."
I was 15.
I said, "Okay, I'm off."
I dropped out of high school
when I was 16,
so I waited an extra year.
Did you really drop
out of school at 16?
Yeah, in high ?? Yeah,
I was a high?school dropout.
?Did you go to college?
?Yeah.
I was 16,
dropped out of high school,
started taking
graduate?level classes,
and got my MBA
by the time I was 19,
transferred those
back to high school
so I could graduate
from high school.
So, Carson, you said
that you had gotten
some help to make these 'cause
you can't make them anymore.
What's your deal with them?
Madrid Skateboards,
and they are manufacturing
my boards, doing everything,
and then I just put
the trucks and wheels on.
How do I know there isn't
a Carson in New Jersey
doing the same thing?
The main reason skaters buy
product is for brand loyalty.
So, when they go to buy
a Locker Board,
they're gonna want
a Locker Board,
not some fake.
Two ?? they're really hard
to make.
You have to have
all the right equipment,
all the right hardware.
And three ?? I'm
in patent?pending status.
You kill it, Carson!
Bam!
?Drop the mic!
?Buh?bam!
?Bam!
?Bam!
[ Laughter ]
Listen, you're amazing.
But I'm not going to invest
in the company.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Carson, where do you want
to be a year from now,
two years from now,
five years from now?
I want to be...
everywhere.
[ Light laughter ]
That's a lot of places.
He sound?? He sounds
like one of us.
What's been amazing,
online's great
because he has
much higher profit margins,
but he'd also like
to be in retailers
because it does give him
a lot of credibility.
Right now, he's in
a Southern California retailer,
Jack's Surfboards.
He's in two of their stores.
You know, here's what I think.
You know, I would not invest
in your company now
because I think that you have
so much growth,
and giving up 15% or 20%
of your company right now
is absolutely absurd.
You have a lot of room to grow,
and I think you'll do it
without us.
So, I'm out.
Okay.
Cuban: Carson,
I love what you're doing.
I want to make you an offer.
Okay?
I'll give you the $60,000,
but I want 20%.
And my plan is not just to help
you manufacture
'cause you have Madrid
to do that.
That part's all taken care of.
Yes.
...but to really help you
build up your YouTube,
help you build up
your Instagram.
So, if you want
to be my partner,
I'm happy to make
the investment.
Wow.
What do you say?
Branson:
Before he answers...
?[ Chuckles ]
?I?I was gonna suggest that ??
You keep on touching me.
I was gonna suggest that ??
You keep on touching ??
I was gonna suggest that
you and I work together on it.
Nope.
No?
Nope.
No. All right.
?[ Chuckles ]
?So, what do you say
you and I work together?
For 20%?
So Carson, I'm...
Robert?
[ Chuckles ]
I love things
that are cool and fun.
I really don't think
you should sell
any of your business
at this point
because it's just too soon.
I don't want any of the equity.
What I'll do is I'll give you
the $60,000 as a loan.
What interest?rate, Robert?
Whatever bank rate is,
like, right?
Okay, 8%, give or take.
Right?
I'm offering $60,000 for 20%.
Wow.
?Great job, Carson.
?Great deal.
Good job, Carson!
Good job, Carrie.
?Good job.
?Thank you.
?Congrats.
?Thank you so much.
[ Hushed voice ] Yes!
[ Hushed voice ] Wow!
You know,
wanting to do everything,
that really hits home, I think,
with all of us.
It's contradictory to, of
course, what everyone's taught.
I mean, I think about when we
started the show nine years ago.
That's the biggest change.
As I go around
the country...
Yeah.
Cuban: All about the kids.
...half the people that
come up to me are kids.
It's all about the kids,
yeah.
Yeah.
Sierra Madre Research.
We're here to offer
15% of our company
in exchange for $175,000.
At some point in life,
most of us have
the fantastic idea
to embark
on a camping trip.
We head out
with a grand sense of adventure
only to end up
tossing and turning
on the hard, uneven ground,
and then waking up
cold and wet
from a storm
that soaked the tent.
Well, Sharks, we're here
to elevate
your camping experience.
Sierra Madre Research...
[ Laughter ]
...is a solution?driven
outdoor gear company
that designs and creates
the most innovative,
protective,
and comfortable
hammock camping equipment
on the market today.
We have pioneered
the ground?to?air tent segment
of the outdoor market.
So, Sharks, which of you
would like to join
Sierra Madre Research
in elevating
the camping experience
around the world?
?[ Chuckles ]
?Great job, guys.
But wait.
Before we get started,
I know somebody needs
to come up here and take a nap.
John: Yes!
So let's get in.
Come check it out.
for their hammock tent company,
Sierra Madre.
I really like your product.
But for me,
believing in the entrepreneur
is the most important thing.
