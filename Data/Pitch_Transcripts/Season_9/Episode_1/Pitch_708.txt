My name is Aaron Wypyszynski,
and I'm the founder
of Wyp Aviation.
I'm from Huntsville, Alabama,
and I'm here today
seeking $500,000
for a 20% stake in my company.
Wypyszynski:
There you go.
You can put
your index fingers on here.
?Ooh!
?That's cool.
And that's what allows you
to do the barrel rolls...
Herjavec: That is cool!
...when you're on tow.
Yeah, 'cause you want to do
barrel rolls behind a plane.
[ Laughter ]
Will you take off attached
to the plane, yes?
You do, yes.
You take off
like a glider.
Right.
So, I'm actually
a glider tow pilot.
[ Laughs ]
Thank you.
[ Laughter ]
How did that feel
to stand up there?
It's ?? It ?? It ??
It's gonna be a real thrill.
That's for sure.
The thought of that, physically,
to me, is just not appealing.
I don't know that I would want
to go have that experience.
I'm out.
It's really cool
when I thought it could kill me.
When I saw it in a wind tunnel,
it didn't look as cool.
Yes.
So, the wind tunnel ??
So, what's the business?
The idea is the wind tunnel ??
And that wind tunnel's
a little bit restrictive.
So that's the only
business today.
You're not trying
to get us to invest
in something behind
an airplane.
You use the airplane
to drive the marketing.
You pair with someone
like a Red Bull
or with Virgin to do
a big marketing campaign.
And how much is it per hour?
I guess you're gonna
be charging people?
Right, so it's actually ??
It's very comparable
to indoor skydiving.
Indoor skydiving
is anywhere between
$70 and $80 for a two?minute,
first?time flight.
And we're right in that region.
So we're about $80, $85.
So, what's it cost to build
one location?
So, one location is between
$4 million and $5 million.
Oh!
Herjavec: What?
?So...
?Whoa. Wait a minute, here.
Yes, so that's very ??
It's actually a little bit
less expensive than building
an indoor skydiving facility.
Aaron, how much money do you
think you're gonna have to raise
before you can get
your first location open?
So, we're looking for about
$2 million to $3 million
to open that first location.
And then we're ??
You said it was $5 million
to $6 million just to open.
And then we're gonna ??
We're gonna finance the ??
the rest of that.
So you got to raise $3 million
and borrow $3 million.
Correct.
Yes.
I think it's gonna
be expensive, obviously.
I think it's gonna be tough
to borrow the money.
And most importantly,
I'm terrified of heights.
?[ Chuckles ]
?I've done indoor skydiving,
and I thought I was gonna puke
before I hit the ground.
And so it's just not
a fit for me.
So, for those reasons,
I'm out.
I know that I was on your mind
as the number?one Shark
in aviation to invest in.
[ Chuckles ]
You are the action?sports guy
on this panel.
I am.
I just think if it's going
to be successful,
it's gonna take a long time
and a lot of money,
so I'm out.
?Thanks.
?Congratulations, Aaron.
?Thank you very much.
?Thank you very much.
Cuban: It's really cool.
It was a pleasure
to talk with all of you.
Congrats.
