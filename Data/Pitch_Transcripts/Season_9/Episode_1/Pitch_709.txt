Narrator:
And tonight, Richard Branson,
billionaire founder
of the Virgin Group,
is recognized
as one of the most innovative
and successful entrepreneurs
of all time.
People thought we were mad
doing Virgin Galactic.
People will think
you're mad doing this.
Whoo?hoo!
Narrator: A groundbreaking
new season begins.
Richard?
Oh, this has got Richard's
name all over it!
I've broken enough legs.
[ Laughs ]
What extreme sport
do you like the most?
Well,
it's not really extreme.
I just love kitesurfing.
?Awesome!
?'Cause I live on an island,
I can do it every day.
It's just great.
Whoo!
Whoo!
I'm curious, Richard,
what was your first business?
My first, sort of,
was to start a magazine
to campaign against
the Vietnamese War
that was going on.
So, it became a national
magazine for young people...
Wow.
...and that was
my education, but...
Look, this is great.
But you're gonna stay at school,
so you're gonna have to learn
to delegate...
Yeah.
...because too many people think
they can do it all themselves.
And Sir Richard Branson
is offering $65,000 for 20%.
?And we're gonna help ??
?What would you like to do?
Richard,
if you're gonna invest,
how would you help
my company?
Oh, you're gonna
interview him?
Wow!
[ Laughter ]
I like that!
I like it!
You got guts!
Wow!
Well, you said you wanted
to do everything.
I remember,
I had this magazine,
and somebody wanted to buy it.
Went to lunch
to sell the company.
So I said, "I'm gonna start
Student Airlines,
I'm gonna start, you know,
Student record shops,
Student this," and they
got completely panicked,
and so when you said
you wanted to do everything,
I remembered that moment
when I wanted to do everything.
Let me be honest.
I see a young Richard Branson
in you.
You've got a wonderful story
to tell.
You're very articulate.
The product itself is great.
We'd love you
to give it a shot with us.
[ Chuckles nervously ]
I chose Richard Branson
because he would help me
the most.
Internationally, right?
Internationally.
Yeah.
And also,
he had the highest offer,
and I felt like, "Phew!"
Make a little bit more.
[ Both laugh ]
Richard,
you're a daredevil, right?
Like, you like to do extreme
sports and things like that.
Well, yeah, I suppose.
I ?? Do you mind
if I have a try?
?Yeah.
?Yes! Definitely! Hop on!
All right,
let's get down to this.
That's how it ??
Yep. Put a foot up here.
Okay.
That works.
Oh, with that.
There you go.
Slide your foot
under the back there.
?Oh, my God, that is so cool.
?Wow.
You're lucky
Richard's here today.
Branson: Well, as ?? as you
know, I love adventure.
People thought we were mad
doing Virgin Galactic.
People will think
you're mad doing this.
This is intriguing to me,
but investing $500,000 with
what you've presented me today,
I just can't get to that.
Good luck, but I'm out.
I'm like Richard.
I ?? If it goes fast
and it's slightly dangerous,
I just want to try it.
I mean, I've parachuted.
I'd go into outer space
if Richard sold me a ticket.
?[ Chuckles ]
?He'll sell you a ticket.
If you ever have a service where
I can get behind an airplane,
I would definitely love
to try it.
[ Chuckles ]
But as a business
where you've got to raise
$5 million to $6 million
per location,
ooh, I don't ??
I don't know about that.
I would love
to be the second one to try it
right behind Richard.
[ Laughter ]
But for now, I'm out.
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Richard Rhett.
And I'm Juli Rhett.
And we'd like to introduce you
to our company ??
Yeah, yeah.
Come on, Richard.
Come on. Guys, you can put
two people in each tent.
I'll look at it.
[ Grunts ]
There you go.
Now...
[ Screams ]
[ Greiner laughs ]
And then put your legs
over here on this side.
Juli: There you go.
Oh, this is fun!
Come on, Lori!
How did you get in?
[ Laughs ]
Look at them!
Oh, my God!
Could the neighbors
keep quiet, please?
I'm trying to sleep.
Is it gonna crash?
[ Laughter ]
?How does it feel?
?Oh, wow!
?Yeah!
?This is so cool.
You can toss your cellphone
in this pocket.
It's very strong.
That was really fun.
Yeah.
That thing was
really, really strong.
I'm glad you got in.
All three of us
hopped in that thing.
Richard:
So, it's super?strong.
That was so comfortable.
I love the mosquito netting.
I love
that you're off the ground.
But how do you get that
up into the tree?
Yeah.
How hard is that process?
Sure.
So, this goes around the tree.
All you have to do
is reach up to your height,
what's comfortable for you.
We've got three main parts ??
the rain protection,
the insect protection,
and the gear stash
where you put your pack.
It all clips together
with color?coded clips
so you can easily see where
your attachments needs to go.
What does it cost?
$350 for the entire
package here.
That's including a hammock,
including the suspension system,
including two carabiners.
What would that cost you
to make?
Well, we have a 62% margin
on that.
Are you the only hammock tent?
We are not necessarily ??
We are the first,
but we're not the only
hammock tent at this point.
'Cause there's others.
There are shelter systems
that are designed for hammocks.
Are there shelter systems
like yours?
No.
No, no.
We've created a technical tent
for the hammock community.
That hasn't been done.
Richard ?? Richard, would you
put these on Necker Island?
[ Laughter ]
I would ?? It seems great
if you're going
for individual camping,
but I mean, I think
one of the romantic things
about going tenting
is you have your partner
with you, and ??
You think we haven't
tested it?
I mean, I'm knocked up
right now. It's ??
[ Laughs ]
Oh, you are?!
Congratulations!
Wow!
Richard:
That's number three.
This happened in a hammock.
That's number three
right there.
It's a hammock baby.
Yeah.
All right, you guys got to stop
going camping.
[ Laughter ]
How did you come up
with this idea?
2009 ?? On a medical
mission trip in Honduras,
providing clean drinking water
for people that don't have it.
80% of the people
that we ran across had illnesses
based solely
on clean drinking water.
Sleeping in a hammock,
I was up in the air.
It was lightweight.
But I wasn't comfortable.
I'm an engineer ??
analytical mind.
Why do we have
these two problems?
When I go home,
I start sourcing fabric,
trying to find a way
to make a better hammock.
We come to find a?a solution
in creating products
that add value
to people around the world.
We take a small portion
of our profits,
and we dedicate that
to drilling clean?water wells
in Central America
right now,
which we would expand to other
countries as we get bigger.
And that's our passion.
That's our ??
That's what we want to do.
But you got to pay the bills.
You got to make a profit.
What are your sales?
Last year,
we did $208,000.
This year we are on track
to hit $430,000 to $500,000.
?Wow.
?All right.
How do people
find out about you?
Majority of our sales
are coming from word of mouth
and because people ??
They buy our gear.
They tell their friends,
they ?? their friends come,
their aunts and uncles,
their grandparents ??
everybody's buying gear
from us
because
they've seen this work.
I think this stuff
is incredible.
Thank you.
Thank you, Daymond.
You're absolutely amazing.
You are the brand,
but I don't even know
how I'd be able to help you.
I think there may be
some better people up here
that can work with you.
I'm out.
Thank you, Daymond.
Thank you, Daymond.
There's other ones out there,
right?
What's really different
about you,
and how do you feel you can go
up against the competition?
So, the competitors
in the market,
they're not innovating.
They're sticking with the tarp
and the hammock
with the bug netting
over the hammock,
which is claustrophobic.
Yours is better, clearly.
But my concern is I don't know
this market well enough,
and it feels to me like
it might be a crowded space.
[ Sighs ]
I have to be out.
If you haven't been
knocked off yet, you will be.
And it's not really an industry
that I think
is gonna get huge enough
for me to get excited about it.
And so for those reasons,
I'm out.
[ Sighs ]
Richard, Juli, I've always
wanted to have a business
where I can wear sandals
to work.
[ Chuckles ]
I mean, how great is that?
I think you're doing
something great,
but I was waiting for that hook
to get me there.
I'm sorry.
It's just not for me right now.
I'm out.
And then there was one.
Richard Branson
is Richard and Juli's
last chance for a deal
Cuban: All right.
Congratulations, Richard.
We would love to take that deal,
Richard Branson.
Right.
Well done.
?Thank you so much.
?Good luck.
?Excited. Excited.
?Good luck.
?Pleasure.
?Thank you.
?Congratulations, guys.
?Whoo!
That's what we wanted.
That's who we wanted!
Aah!
We're excited.
Let's kiss.
Ohh!
Getting this deal
with Richard Branson
is amazing for our company.
We're gonna be able to make gear
for the entire world.
Also, I mean,
the guy's got an island.
We're gonna put so many hammocks
on that island for him.
It's gonna be incredible.
Man:
Richard Branson's made a career
out of breaking tradition.
Branson:
And I'll use those resources
to do, I think,
really worthwhile things...
from climate change
to conflict?resolution issues.
I think "Shark Tank" influences
a lot of people
to actually become
entrepreneurs.
And I'm sure there are a lot
of the future Richard Bransons
who are watching
"Shark Tank" today
who will become
the Richard Bransons
of the future
because of watching
"Shark Tank."
For example, I think Sir Richard
could help us a lot
because your brand embodies
this chillness and coolness,
and that is Simple Habit.
You said you have
over $2 million left,
and you're not
gonna run out of cash
and you're offering us 5%.
What would you like us
to do for that?
We're planning to scale
user acquisition.
We're also going to start
doing a lot of partnership
with celebrities and influencers
because you need ??
Like who?
So, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait right there.
I'm ?? I'm so out.
I'm so out, so out, so out.
[ Greiner chuckles ]
Did you hear what you just said?
You want us to pay you
and not be compensated,
basically, for our brand.
Right ?? We can only see
so many people, Richard.
Because if ?? if ?? if ??
Because if you make money
out of her,
you've got more money
to give to other people.
No, no, no,
but that's not the case.
This show is because
of the people
who had no place else
to go.
And you know what,
I'd rather give my time
and opportunity to somebody else
who desperately needs it.
I'm out.
Greiner:
Okay, so, I love meditation.
I do.
But I don't think you need
to actually be raising
more money.
I'm not even sure
that it's so responsible
at this point
to your investors.
While I might be a customer,
I won't be an investor.
I'm sorry.
I'm out.
Cuban: That's why I called you
a gold digger.
It wasn't a personal issue.
It was more about coming here,
not really wanting a deal,
but looking to get
the commercial.
That sounds
pretty personal.
Branson: I think
"Shark Tank's" for people
who have all kinds
of different businesses
and all different kinds
of backgrounds.
It's funny.
I was talking
to my son earlier today,
and he has learned meditation
recently.
And he just said
how wonderful he feels.
I've not meditated.
I've tried once
and I just fell asleep
when I was trying to ??
trying to meditate.
[ Chuckles ]
I'd love to be converted
into meditation
because those people
who do meditation
seem a lot happier
than those people who don't.
So, I would be reluctant to get
involved at the $600,000.
Oh, shocking!
Oh, what happened?
Shocking!
So ?? So ??
Just 'cause you ??
Just 'cause you
crap on her
with a fancy voice...
No. No.
doesn't mean it's not
the same thing.
No, I'm ?? I'm ??
[Laughing] I'm just gonna ??
I'm about to throw water
at these two guys.
Could we possibly come in
at $300,000 and maybe for 10%?
No, no, no, no, no,
Sir Richard Branson.
I'm asking a question.
It has to be $600,000.
Oh, okay.
I think the water
just has to go.
[ Laughter ]
Let me ?? Let me tell you
what I think.
[ All gasp ]
[ Laughter ]
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
I'm out of here.
Richard offered you
$300,000 for 10%.
You need $600,000.
I'll give you $300,000 also
for 10%.
So you've got $600,000,
if Richard
will come in with me ??
At 20%.
At 20%.
There you go.
Branson: First of all,
excuse these very rude people
on this panel,
which, of course,
I've punished one.
We'll ?? We'll sort
the other one out in a minute.
The last thing anybody
should be embarrassed about
is having raised good money
for their company.
And I think the bigger
the war chest you have,
chances are that you'll reach
millions of people
around the world.
And I would love to see
if I can help you reach
those millions of people.
I really appreciate the offer.
Um, but I do have the obligation
to stay fair to some of the
investors that have, earlier on,
invested in me
and gambled on me.
I mean, you have to agree
that there's a value
in having a Shark.
So I think, as Mark said,
we're not ?? I'm not ??
I don't feel compelled
to offer
at the same value
as the other investors did.
With all due respect to them,
make us a counter.
Would you be able to do
$10 million of valuation?
Yeah.
We're going to build
the world's largest platform
for health and wellness.
We are changing
people's lives ??
people that are going
through cancer,
that are going
through divorce...
I don't want to speak
for Richard.
I'm very happy to do it
on that basis.
Herjavec:
You've seen the show.
There's tremendous value
of being on here.
I actually think
there's a val??
That's why she's here.
I actually think there's a value
add to your investors
that perhaps
you're not factoring in.
You valued the visibility.
You valued
the increased marketability
and the value
to your product.
But you really
didn't value us.
?Well ??
?And I get ?? I get
your position that
the three months of accel??
Leave me alone.
He's not ?? He's not ??
Yo! Bro!
You're not involved
in this.
