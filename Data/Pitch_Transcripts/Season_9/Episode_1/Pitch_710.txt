My name is Yunha,
and I'm from San Francisco.
My company is Simple Habit,
Yunha: Voilà.
There's a five?minute
meditation for you.
Yunha:
We have many teachers.
It's one of the teachers
on our app.
Do you pay people
for their voice?
We give out 20%
of our net revenue
to our meditation teachers.
The business has been going
for how long now?
Less than a year.
In your first 12 months,
how it's gone?
In less than one year
since our launch,
we've had over half a million
users use this product.
Wow.
Yunha: We've grown
from zero to $750,000
in annual recurring revenue.
Wow.
What's your own
personal background?
My dad came to the States
from South Korea
to study engineering.
So, wait, wait, Yunha, if you
think we can add so much value,
why are you valuing
our contributions
as the exact same as any other
investor in this note?
Because that note
was from many months before
when we had much less revenue.
We didn't even have half
of our team at that time.
So now the risk of the company's
much lower.
So what is it exactly do
you think we can contribute?
Yunha: No, that's not
what I'm talking about.
as they debate the motivation
for Yunha coming into the Tank
with her meditation app,
Simple Habit.
Greiner: Let me ?? Let me
tell you what I think.
[ All gasp ]
[ Laughter ]
Oh, my God!
[ Gasps ]
Herjavec: Yunha, I?I?I think
it's so disrespectful to say
just because you've done
a great job of raising money
that you don't deserve
to be here.
Everybody who can make it here
deserves to be here.
So, welcome to the Shark Tank.
I just ??
John:
Are you gonna give her money?
Well, hang on.
Yunha,
why are you crying?
I just get a lot of letters
from people that
we changed their lives with,
Yeah, I?I ?? Yunha,
I?I love your ??
your drive with it.
It's obviously
deeply personal to it.
You know,
your counter's roughly 6%.
I can't get there.
I mean,
I'll go down to 15%.
I'd love
to be involved with it.
Leave me alone.
Yunha, he's ??
he's out already.
We're happy ?? We're happy
to do 15% if you'd like it.
Yeah.
I am thrilled.
I would love
to be involved with it.
I just can't do 15%.
Yunha, I?I think you're being
a little short?sighted.
I'm out.
I don't think
she's being short?sighted.
She's doing what's right
for her ?? her shareholders
for ?? for her company.
She's got the money.
Congratulations on creating
an incredible company.
Good luck.
But, sadly, I'm out.
I wish you all ??
all the very best.
Thank you.
?Good luck.
?Good luck.
?Thank you, guys.
?Congratulations, Yunha.
?Good luck, Yunha.
