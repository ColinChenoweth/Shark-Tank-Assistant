My name is Yunha,
and I'm from San Francisco.
My company is Simple Habit,
and we're seeking $600,000
in exchange
for 5% of the company.
Ugh.
[ Herjavec chuckles ]
?Now...
?The Valley takes over.
Now, before you get stressed out
by these numbers
[Laughing] I'd like to ??
So stressed out.
I'd like to invite all of you
to close your eyes with me.
Let's just take
one deep breath together.
Hmm.
Breathing in deeply.
[ Sighs ]
$600,000...
?[ Snoring ]
?$12 million valuation...
?5%...
?[ Laughs ]
These people are horrible.
Just don't ?? don't ??
Don't do business with them.
They're just horrible people.
Whoop?whoop?whoop?whoop.
Breathing out slowly.
Open your eyes now.
Oh, it's only $2 million.
Where's my wallet?
[ Laughter ]
Feel better?
You just meditated.
Simple Habit
is meditation made simple.
Our five?minute meditation app
is designed
for your busy lifestyle.
It's so easy to use.
Let me show you.
First,
download and open the app.
Second, tell the app
what you're up to.
For example,
let's try "Before Work."
Today, I'm feeling
the Monday Blues.
Man: Welcome to Simple Habit's
session on the Monday Blues.
Let's try and shift
our mind?set today
and take it
one moment at a time.
Yunha: Voilà.
There's a five?minute
meditation for you.
We create
thousands of meditations
by top teachers
from around the world.
You'll find meditations
guided by mindfulness experts
to executive coaches
who normally charge thousands
of dollars for their teaching.
But with Simple Habit,
you can get them all
right at your fingertips.
So, Sharks, please join me today
in helping the world
reduce stress, improve focus,
and sleep better.
Greiner:
The voice that we heard ??
Is that the actual voice
on the app?
Yunha:
We have many teachers.
It's one of the teachers
on our app.
Do you pay people
for their voice?
We give out 20%
of our net revenue
to our meditation teachers.
The business has been going
for how long now?
Less than a year.
In your first 12 months,
how it's gone?
In less than one year
since our launch,
we've had over half a million
users use this product.
Wow.
Yunha: We've grown
from zero to $750,000
in annual recurring revenue.
Wow.
What's your own
personal background?
My dad came to the States
from South Korea
to study engineering.
My mom worked at Dunkin' Donuts
to support him, and I was born.
And then they went back
to South Korea for a job.
When I was 14, I decided
to come to the States by myself
to study at a boarding school
in Portland, Oregon.
I went to Duke for my undergrad,
where I double?majored
in economics and Chinese,
and my first job out of college
was in investment banking.
One day, I had a business idea
that I wanted to pursue,
so I quit that job,
and that's how I started
my previous start?up.
What was it?
It was a software business
called Locket.
Because ??
And what happened
to that company?
So, we sold that company
a few years ago.
After selling the company,
I went to Stanford
Business School,
and it was there I started
working on Simple Habit.
Hang on, you've got
to do more with your life.
[ Laughter ]
You're just ?? You're not
packing enough in.
So, if you ?? if you've got
$750,000 in the first year,
what do you think you could
get in the second year?
Sure. We've been growing
at 50% quarter over quarter.
So, last month,
we did $75,000 in sale.
And this month,
we are on track to do $90,000.
And what's the cost?
It's a free?to?download app.
But if you want unlimited access
to some of our premium content,
for example,
meditation before an interview,
meditation for engineers ??
?So ??
?What does that cost?
$11.99 a month
or $99.99 a year.
So, how many people are doing
the subscription service?
Over 5,000 subscribers
as of today.
Do you have
a main competitor?
Yeah, there are meditation apps
out there.
In fact, this was why
I started the business
because most of the apps out
there only have one teacher,
and it's all that
his or her voice.
And after a while,
you start to tune out.
So you're creating a collection,
a vast amount,
and that's
your differentiator.
Right.
We're a marketplace
for teachers and students.
Branson: Were you ??
Were you profitable,
or were you losing money
in the first year?
We've been losing money even now
because profitability
is not our main component.
Right.
When would you expect
to be profitable?
Herjavec: Isn't that nice?
[ Greiner chuckles ]
So, we're expected to be doing
over $5 million next year.
How much money
did you raise?
We've raised about $2.8 million.
?Ooh!
?Oh, wow!
?What?!
?Wow!
?$2.8 million?
Yeah, for what percentage?
The latest round was
at $12 million valuation cap.
We used convertible notes.
How much of the $2.8 million
is left?
We have most of it
in the bank today.
We have about ??
over $2.3 million.
So then why are you here?
So what do you need
the $600,000 from us for?
I'm here because I think
that you guys
can add so much value to us.
So, wait, wait, Yunha, if you
think we can add so much value,
why are you valuing
our contributions
as the exact same as any other
investor in this note?
Because that note
was from many months before
when we had much less revenue.
We didn't even have half
of our team at that time.
So now the risk of the company's
much lower.
So what is it exactly do
you think we can contribute?
Yunha: No, that's not
what I'm talking about.
She's gonna ?? You're
gonna go out and pay
a bunch of other people...
?Right.
...but you want us to pay you
the same thing
that they're gonna do.
Sorry. Sorry.
Can I clarify?
?Okay.
We would love to partner
with other celebrities
and influencers.
Cuban: But from
an investment perspective,
you don't need the cash.
That's a nice problem.
She's gonna get exposure
from being on this program.
She can get ??
She can get good partners.
But, yeah ??
But that's what she is.
She's a gold digger.
Hmm?
She's a gold digger.
No, she's not a gold digger.
Did you just call me
a gold digger?
[ Laughs ]
Yes.
John: A gold digger.
Yes.
Listen. That's not ??
You know what it is?
There's so many people
around the country
that stand on that carpet
and they busted their butt
and they've sold their house
and mortgaged everything
they've had
and their kids' college fund
to hopefully get
$200,000, $300,000
to run their business.
Every time somebody steps
on this carpet
who has a couple of million
dollars in the bank,
you take away
the opportunity
of somebody
who may have lost their home
or sold their kids'
college fund,
and you take
that opportunity away from them
when you could
go get money elsewhere.
Oh, that's so unfair.
Herjavec: Yeah.
It is not. It is not.
I mean, no.
No, because ??
as they debate the motivation
for Yunha coming into the Tank
with her meditation app,
Simple Habit.
Greiner: Let me ?? Let me
tell you what I think.
[ All gasp ]
[ Laughter ]
Oh, my God!
[ Gasps ]
Herjavec: Yunha, I?I?I think
it's so disrespectful to say
just because you've done
a great job of raising money
that you don't deserve
to be here.
Everybody who can make it here
deserves to be here.
So, welcome to the Shark Tank.
I just ??
John:
Are you gonna give her money?
Well, hang on.
Yunha,
why are you crying?
I just get a lot of letters
from people that
we changed their lives with,
um, and I?I'm not lying.
We get so many letters
from people
that are going through
difficult times in their lives.
While I understand this
is an investment opportunity ??
But I really think
that we can really
change the world together.
Yeah, I?I ?? Yunha,
I?I love your ??
your drive with it.
It's obviously
deeply personal to it.
You know,
your counter's roughly 6%.
I can't get there.
I mean,
I'll go down to 15%.
I'd love
to be involved with it.
Leave me alone.
Yunha, he's ??
he's out already.
We're happy ?? We're happy
to do 15% if you'd like it.
Yeah.
I am thrilled.
I would love
to be involved with it.
I just can't do 15%.
Yunha, I?I think you're being
a little short?sighted.
I'm out.
I don't think
she's being short?sighted.
She's doing what's right
for her ?? her shareholders
for ?? for her company.
She's got the money.
Congratulations on creating
an incredible company.
Good luck.
But, sadly, I'm out.
I wish you all ??
all the very best.
Thank you.
?Good luck.
?Good luck.
?Thank you, guys.
?Congratulations, Yunha.
?Good luck, Yunha.
