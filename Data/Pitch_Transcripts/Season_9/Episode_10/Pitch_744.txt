Hello, Sharks.
My name's Tom Burden.
I'm from the small farm town
of Celina, Ohio,
and I'm seeking $200,000
in exchange for 10%
of my company.
Sharks, let me ask you
a question.
Have you ever been inspired
by a really good idea
when doing maintenance
on a fighter?jet machine gun?
Oh.
All the time.
Oh, yeah.
Every day.
Well, I have.
I'm an F?16 weapons mechanic
in the United States Air Force,
and I encounter a problem
time and time again.
When working
on top of the aircraft,
I'm constantly trying
to keep my tools close
and my hardware organized.
Seems like a simple enough task,
but on the aircraft's
slick surface,
it is nearly impossible.
Would you believe me
if I told you that,
in general aviation,
to solve this problem,
mechanics are using anything
from rags, muffin trays,
and, my favorite,
urinal cakes.
Yes.
Hopefully clean urinal cakes.
Clearly, these products
just aren't cutting it.
To solve this problem,
I introduce to you the Grypmat.
It's a flexible,
nonslip tool tray
ensuring that your tools
and hardware
stay in place on any surface.
We currently have three sizes ??
the small, medium, large ??
all equipped with the ability
to hold tools
up to a 70?degree angle.
Let me show you how it works.
The small's equipped
with six compartments
to keep your hardware
organized.
The medium
has two small compartments
and an open field
for hand tools.
And then the large
has four small compartments,
an open field for hand tools,
and then handles so you can
easily move your workstation.
Although the Grypmat
was born into aviation,
it can be found useful
in every field,
whether it's making hats
out of your garage,
building rockets,
assembling computers,
making jewelry,
or tinkering underneath
the hood of your car.
So, Sharks,
one question remains ??
who here is ready to get a grip?
A Grypmat, that is.
Cuban: Do you have samples
for us to look at?
Yes.
And thank you
for your service.
?Thank you.
?Absolutely.
?Yeah.
?So, this is the medium.
The medium is actually
the most popular size.
Right.
So, if you notice,
on the medium and the large,
there's also
a measurement system.
Branson:
What I love about "Shark Tank"
is that everyday people
are solving everyday problems.
With Virgin Galactic in mind
and with our airlines in mind,
um, yeah,
this would be tremendous.
Our engineering teams,
they would welcome
something like this enormously.
You can make
an offer right now.
Richard, Richard ??
If you know anyone
that owns an airline,
let me know, and we could ??
we could ??
Branson: Look, I tell you what,
we would definitely buy them.
So, the question is whether you
can make money as a business,
so...
Have you sold any yet?
Do you have
a business here yet?
Yes.
So, we've sold
roughly 10,000 units,
total of $400,000
in sales.
Oh.
And when did you
start selling?
We started selling, um,
roughly 10 months ago.
What was your net?
So, between $150,000
and $200,000,
which I've taken that and
reinvested it into inventory.
?Wow.
?Good for you. Good for you.
That's impressive.
?That's great.
John: All right, where have
you been selling them?
Yeah. So, um, the big thing
has been, um, selling online.
Trade shows have been
very significant for us.
So far, I've gotten
a handful of, um, fighter jets,
and then, also,
I've sold to NASA.
We're specifying
in the aviation industry,
and we're about to grow
into the automotive industry.
Are you gonna go into retail
with ?? with it at all?
That's something, honestly,
I need guidance on
of how to navigate with ??
especially with the big?box.
Um, it's my understanding,
they'll really push you around.
What's the application
for cars, though?
I'm underneath the car,
everything's flat.
Right, if you're working
underneath the hood of the car,
typically what you're doing
is you're scattering your tools
all over the engine.
So your tools are typically,
like, black or silver,
which just blend in
to the engine.
So, like, the key thing
within the product
is getting the user in the habit
of putting the tools
into the tray,
so building that habit.
Okay. So, what do you
sell them for at retail,
what's your cost?
Yeah.
So, retail,
the small is $29.99.
The medium is $44.99.
?Wow.
The large is $69.99.
Landed cost
is roughly 25% of that.
Is this silicone?
It's a silicone?polymer mix.
Silicone goes to
500 degrees.
Correct.
Let's say on an engine
or if it's hot,
that's not gonna melt.
Correct.
Silicone
goes to 500 degrees?
?It does.
?You're smart, lady.
You're smart.
[ Laughter ]
So, aren't there other silicone
trays out there, or no?
No, basically, the hot thing
that's been selling is just ??
it's a sheet of material.
So, t?the big thing
is having the lip
so things can't, like,
roll down.
Have you applied to any ??
for any patents or anything?
Yes, right now, we have
a?a utility patent pending.
So, how much have you
invested so far?
So, personal money,
about $40,000,
and then also raised
about $150,000
through grants and doing
business competitions.
You are incredible,
my friend.
So, Tom,
what ?? what's the next step?
My vision for the company is to
keep inv?inventing new products.
Um, that's something
that I see a lot
that's a big problem
within the startup community
is that they're not
innovative people.
It's people
with an innovative idea.
They have one good idea,
and they can't make 2.0,
they can't shock the world
with the next generation.
So, what is your 2.0?
I want to have more products
that integrate with the Grypmat,
things that would attach
to the Grypmat,
if it's a flashlight,
a magnet,
or if it's, you know,
something with a lid.
If you're gonna be the chief
innovation officer, right,
Yes.
...who's gonna run
the company?
Uh, that's where
I'm slowly building a team.
Okay. So your challenge appears
to be back office,
putting together
a sales force, right?
Right.
Having an organization
already in place...
Right.
...so you can focus on...
Innovation.
...innovation
while somebody else
handles all the nuts and bolts
of the business.
Yes.
I'm curious about you.
You said that you grew up
in a small town in Ohio.
Yes.
Can you tell us
about yourself?
Growing up, I always
wanted to be an inventor.
Came time to go to college,
my parents told me
that they weren't going to
pay for my college,
so, um, to call their bluff,
I told them
I was gonna join the military.
Turns out they weren't bluffing,
and...
[ Laughter ]
...so now I've been in the
service for eight years now.
What are you gonna do
with the $200,000?
I'm going to reinvest it
into more inventory
so we can beef up our ??
our volume
so we can get the price down
per piece.
All right, Tom, listen,
I see a different application.
I think there's something else
here I think this is good for.
Infants I think this is good
for...
For infants?
...senior living, with dexterity
issues, in hospitals.
Barbie.
Daymond, you can't
put your baby in this.
For Barbie's shoes?
Well, trust me ??
babies like to
throw things
across the room, right?
Or ?? Or even in hospital beds,
right?
You know, the ?? the tray
can easily, um, slide off.
So are there other areas that
you've tried to sell at all?
So, had a lot of interest in,
like, gunsmiths,
medical is
a really big one.
Yeah.
I'm from Britain.
What ?? What's a gun?
[ Laughter ]
I think this can have
a lot of applications.
I want to take it over to my
friends over at Cox Automotive
and also going to
the areas I talked about.
So I'm gonna offer you, uh,
$200,000 for 25%.
Okay.
Um, well, we have a guest.
Forget him.
Isn't that a great offer?
Uh...I think I asked for 10%,
but we'll see. We'll see.
W?What's the market that you
think you just have to be in,
that's just
gonna propel you?
To ?? To me, aviation,
it's easy kills all day.
I think aviation
is so overrated.
I have a deal on the table
for you here.
Look, I have three planes,
right?
I have my own little airline
that I actually own 100% of...
Ooh! "I have three planes!"
Ooh!
...as opposed to
just having investors.
Greiner: I'm sure Richard
has his own planes.
Excuse me,
billionaires,
I have $200,000
on the table for 25%.
I'll...
All right, every time,
I've got to prove my love!
I got $200,000 for 20%.
20%? We're getting closer.
What? You went to 20%?
Herjavec: Closer, closer.
I went to 20% 'cause I don't
have time for you guys.
So, I'll be honest
with you guys ??
my mission here
is to get as many Sharks
to take a bite out of
Grypmat today as possible.
Now,
if you want multiple Sharks,
you realize you'll have to
give up more equity,
'cause it's really not worth 5%
if we split it two ways.
?Correct.
?Okay.
What would you offer
for two or three Sharks?
Uh, depends on the Sharks.
Tom has one offer on the table
from Daymond
for his silicone tray,
Grypmat.
So, I'll be honest
with you guys ??
my mission here
is to get as many Sharks
to take a bite out of
Grypmat today as possible.
What would you offer
for two or three Sharks?
Uh, depends on the Sharks.
Yeah, I'm not ??
Tom, I'm not like Daymond.
I'm not gonna
bet against myself.
Just tell us
what Sharks you want.
Well, obviously,
we have a Shark
that has some experience within
the aviation and space industry.
Branson: Look,
I think you're fantastic.
I think you should concentrate
on what you're good at,
which is, um,
developing new products
and ?? and the product line.
I'd be delighted if
another Shark would
come with me on this.
I have an idea, Richard.
Yeah.
I mean, you know
a lot about airplanes,
I know a lot about cars.
I see it as a big
automotive?industry product.
But I'm gonna want
more equity,
but I also think
we're gonna need more cash.
What about $200,000
for 20% each,
for a total offer
of $400,000 for 40%?
Branson: Yeah, I don't think
Tom is interested
in giving up
so much equity,
so I'll offer $200,000
at 15%.
?15%?
?15%?!
I'll do $200,000
at 15%.
John: Every time,
I got to prove my love.
$200,000, 15%.
Cuban: Tom, here's what I see.
The product sells itself.
Unlike most entrepreneurs, you
have no fear of how it'll sell.
Correct?
Yes.
What you're missing
is infrastructure.
Corporately, you don't have
a sales guy.
Right.
The more you have to
deal with all that,
the less time you have
to do everything else.
John: Tom,
are you gonna concentrate
on the business as ?? as well
as you're concentrating
on these three offers
you have on the table?
Now you're talking to somebody
that does not have an offer yet.
Well, 'cause you keep
on interrupting.
You have three offers
for $200,000 for 15%
by each Shark ?? Daymond,
Richard, and Robert.
Well, let me ?? let me tell you
what our offer is,
and I'll let you decide.
Lori and I together, we're gonna
offer $200,000 for 20%,
but here's the other part.
We'll take over everything.
Okay.
We'll have inventory systems,
custom delivery systems for you,
so wherever you need to ship it,
take over the whole thing.
We'll charge you our costs,
basically...
Yes.
...'cause you'd have to
pay that anyways.
Okay.
Greiner: What I'll bring
to the table is,
I already am in
and have great relationships
with Home Depot,
Lowe's, Ace, True Value...
Yep, we both do.
...all of that ??
and QVC,
and anywhere else that I think
we can get this into.
I've also been in Pep Boys
with my Drop Stop.
What was your offer?
$200,000 for 20%.
Okay.
to decide
what is that one burden of proof
that the person has to submit
to be qualified.
They only upload
a little bit,
and then you reach out to them
according to the study and say,
"Do you have more proof?"
right?
Exactly. Exactly.
You put the information
that the researchers will use.
Cuban: Oh.
Well, let me ask you
more about yourself.
So, where ?? where
in Queens are you from?
So, I lived in Flushing, uh,
for a little bit.
Sure, sure.
I'm actually from Haiti,
so I?I grew up in Haiti.
But in Haiti,
we got the earthquake,
so after high school,
I moved to New York
because I had
a lot of family there,
and that's where
opportunities took me.
And worked my butt off.
I worked up to five jobs
in college.
Majoring in chemistry
and biochemistry
and graduated with honors
in biomedical science research.
What school?
At Queens College.
I tutored French, Spanish,
math, chemistry,
and biology
to private students.
I was selling bags
and ?? and watches at Fossil.
And I was working, also,
next door,
selling jeans and shirts
at American Eagle.
Wow.
So I got a full scholarship
to go to Penn State
for both an MD and a PhD.
Can I make a nonpolitical
comment here?
Yeah.
You're ?? You're
the exact reason why America
should open up to immigrants,
I mean, 'cause
what a wonderful example
you are,
to come from Haiti
and do such great work.
But why do you think
there's gonna be a pandemic?
What we've realized
in the past decade or so
is that there are subtypes
of the same disease
that's directly based
off your genes in you DNA.
So the only way
to figure this thing out
is to study people's DNA.
Do you have a database,
like you go through hospitals
and research centers,
who know who needs this DNA?
Yes. So,
the researchers are there.
Are you going out to them,
or are they coming to you?
?Both, both.
?Okay.
Herjavec:
But give me an example.
How much money
do they typically give you?
Do they need 10 samples?
A typical study
at an academic institution
would need 30,000 samples,
up to 100,000 samples.
Wow.
But the range is extremely wide.
You could use a small study
where you need 25 samples.
Have you sold any so far?
Yes, we have.
We've matched over 500.
We've sold for $30,000.
And how are you
sourcing your subjects?
The most effective so far
has been social media.
How'd you get the trust
for your company?
It ?? It was a little tougher
at the beginning.
Now that we've had
significant press this year ??
I made the Forbes list
30 Under 30 in science.
Ah!
Congratulations.
Yeah,
that's where I saw you.
Thank you.
And so we've been everywhere.
So now it's more like
we need the machine
to get more of a presence
on social media.
I used to sell my blood
all the time.
That was the only way
I could afford ??
?It's less invasive.
?Yeah.
But this is just
a new?age version of that.
?Yes.
?It's amazing.
?That's all automated?
?Those pieces are not automated.
We have crews
that actually go out
and do the edging
and all the other work.
Got it.
That's what I wanted to know.
And we should mention
the history of Robin,
we started the company
a little over two years ago
as more of a "Uber for lawn
care" type of business.
We've built it
to where we do
10,000 jobs a month
and about $400,000 a month
in sales
with that business.
John: Wait a minute.
You have a current business that
uses traditional lawnmowers,
and it's like Uber ??
"Hey, need my lawn cut,"
boom, right?
Yeah.
How much are you doing
on that business, annually?
So, we are just under
a $5 million run rate
on the revenue side.
?Okay.
?Wow.
And we do about 10,000 jobs
a month in Houston,
Austin, and Dallas.
Okay. So this investment is in
that entire business, correct?
It's the whole thing.
Correct.
Okay. So you know what?
You don't look crazy now.
You look great.
Our goal is to convert
all of our customers
into robot customers.
It's more environmentally
friendly,
and, frankly,
it's better margin.
But the problem
isn't the margin.
The problem is
the capital cost, right?
What's it cost per customer?
So ?? Yeah ?? So, the
manufacturers are very motivated
to move this
into the U. S.
We have an agreement in which
we pay nothing up front,
we install the robot,
we charge you,
the customer,
for the first month,
we still don't pay
the manufacturer.
And then,
the next month,
we pay them $45 a month as
a lease model on the mower.
Isn't their grand incentive
to be that
they really want to sell them
to people here in America?
K?Keep getting more customers.
Just customer acquisition?
Because there's the point
where you win, right?
Amazon's the best
example of that,
but Amazon was losing money
up until last year.
Yeah, you know,
for years and years and years.
Cuban:
They're the ultimate startup.
If the company has
enough upside, then you say,
"You know what? Go for it.
I'll keep on giving you money."
Vir?Virgin Galactic,
you know,
we've invested over a billion
dollars now without any income.
I've got a company
that does metallic 3?D printing
with this unique formula.
He doesn't know it yet,
but he's gonna make his rockets
using this technology and it ??
We ?? We al??
We already are.
Maybe not that specific one,
but we already are.
Yeah.
I mean, it'll be this one.

Narrator: Next up is a way
to engage and inspire girls
to get into coding.
