Hello, Sharks.
My name is Olivier Noel.
I'm from Queens, New York.
Yeah.
My company is DNAsimple,
and I'm seeking $100,000
in exchange for 12.5%
of the company.
Sharks, experts are saying that
we are due for a new pandemic,
a catastrophic disease
that can devastate humanity.
And that's why
medical research
is even more important
than ever,
and that's where we come in.
DNAsimple is looking to make
genetic research
happen 10 times faster
so that cures to diseases
can be found 10 times faster.
And my company
is literally paying you
for your saliva sample.
It's all anonymous, and it
happens in four easy steps.
Number one,
you tell me about yourself
in two minutes
on our DNAsimple website.
Number two, we match you
to a research study
that's looking for
people like you.
Number three,
we ship you this little tube
to your house
with a prepaid stamp.
And number four, we give you $50
after you've returned
the sample back to us.
And you can do this
as many times as you can.
You heard correctly ??
we're paying you
for spitting in a tube.
Normally,
it's an extremely expensive
and very long process
for researchers
to get enough samples
for studies,
and our company is basically
making it simple.
We pay you for your spit,
researchers get
the samples they need,
and we get paid
for making it all happen.
It's a win?win for everybody.
Now, Sharks, who's ready
to join me in saving mankind?
I will come around and show you
what the kits look like.
Great.
Here's one for you.
Thanks, Olivier.
Let me give Lori hers.
Such a gentleman.
Thank you, Robert.
?You're welcome, Lori.
?Thank you, sir.
Hopefully, you do match
a study and get your $50.
Thank you very much.
You said that you just
spit into the tube,
send it back to you,
you will pay that person $50,
and they can do it
as often as they want?
If they get matched for a study.
Correct.
For example, if there are
10 researchers across the U. S.
that are looking for...
Female, this and that...
...someone age 20 to 45, that
fit in a particular profile.
No, get it right ??
20 to 25.
[ Laughs ]
In your case, 20 to 25.
Yes.
And so every time you do match,
you get a notification
that you can participate
to the study, and then
we send you a kit,
and every time,
you can get that $50.
So, Olivier, I only get $50
if you can match me to a study.
I will send this to you
after you've matched the study.
Okay. So, how much
are they paying you?
Typically, it would go around
$155 per sample.
So the research companies
are paying you $155.
You're paying $50 of that
right off the top...
Yes.
...for the sample.
Correct.
Any other cost to you?
So you make $100 ??
So, the kit. So, we have ??
We're making the kits in?house.
And what's it cost you
to make each one?
$12.50.
So, people
are answering online,
and they're telling you
about themselves,
and you're trusting that that
information is accurate, right?
How do you vet
that it is?
Okay.
So, for example, if I'm giving
this to a cancer researcher,
I could be a drug addict...
Yeah.
...which is gonna completely
skew the test.
Correct.
Basically,
I leave that to the researcher
to decide
what is that one burden of proof
that the person has to submit
to be qualified.
They only upload
a little bit,
and then you reach out to them
according to the study and say,
"Do you have more proof?"
right?
Exactly. Exactly.
You put the information
that the researchers will use.
Cuban: Oh.
Well, let me ask you
more about yourself.
So, where ?? where
in Queens are you from?
So, I lived in Flushing, uh,
for a little bit.
Sure, sure.
I'm actually from Haiti,
so I?I grew up in Haiti.
But in Haiti,
we got the earthquake,
so after high school,
I moved to New York
because I had
a lot of family there,
and that's where
opportunities took me.
And worked my butt off.
I worked up to five jobs
in college.
Majoring in chemistry
and biochemistry
and graduated with honors
in biomedical science research.
What school?
At Queens College.
I tutored French, Spanish,
math, chemistry,
and biology
to private students.
I was selling bags
and ?? and watches at Fossil.
And I was working, also,
next door,
selling jeans and shirts
at American Eagle.
Wow.
So I got a full scholarship
to go to Penn State
for both an MD and a PhD.
Can I make a nonpolitical
comment here?
Yeah.
You're ?? You're
the exact reason why America
should open up to immigrants,
I mean, 'cause
what a wonderful example
you are,
to come from Haiti
and do such great work.
But why do you think
there's gonna be a pandemic?
What we've realized
in the past decade or so
is that there are subtypes
of the same disease
that's directly based
off your genes in you DNA.
So the only way
to figure this thing out
is to study people's DNA.
Do you have a database,
like you go through hospitals
and research centers,
who know who needs this DNA?
Yes. So,
the researchers are there.
Are you going out to them,
or are they coming to you?
?Both, both.
?Okay.
Herjavec:
But give me an example.
How much money
do they typically give you?
Do they need 10 samples?
A typical study
at an academic institution
would need 30,000 samples,
up to 100,000 samples.
Wow.
But the range is extremely wide.
You could use a small study
where you need 25 samples.
Have you sold any so far?
Yes, we have.
We've matched over 500.
We've sold for $30,000.
And how are you
sourcing your subjects?
The most effective so far
has been social media.
How'd you get the trust
for your company?
It ?? It was a little tougher
at the beginning.
Now that we've had
significant press this year ??
I made the Forbes list
30 Under 30 in science.
Ah!
Congratulations.
Yeah,
that's where I saw you.
Thank you.
And so we've been everywhere.
So now it's more like
we need the machine
to get more of a presence
on social media.
I used to sell my blood
all the time.
That was the only way
I could afford ??
?It's less invasive.
?Yeah.
But this is just
a new?age version of that.
?Yes.
?It's amazing.
Where's the competitive
advantage, Olivier?
Why is your company worth
$1 million today?
Well,
I've worked in the field,
so I understand
exactly what researchers want
and what can pass
and what will not pass.
I literally did this
kind of research for my PhD.
So I think that's
a competitive advantage there.
But, obviously, if we get
one of you Sharks on board,
that's a significant advantage.
What do you
really need the money for?
Do you need entry into
larger researcher facilities?
Do you need ??
Yes.
Until I have 100,000 people
in my database,
I can't go to Pfizer
and say, "I want to help you
lead that next big research
you're gonna do."
Some researchers,
in a five?year grant,
you spend three to four years
to recruit people.
Wow.
Literally,
there are studies that die,
because let's say
you're doing a study
where you'd need a
thousand blacks or Hispanics,
and I'm in
Hershey, Pennsylvania.
No offense ??
it would take about
a hundred years to get
those people, right?
[ Laughter ]
I mean, less than 5% of clinical
trials have minorities in them.
Some people are hard to find,
and so this idea,
that's our
competitive advantage.
So, look, I've just sat here
listening for ?? for a change
and not really contributed,
but having listened,
I think it's
really interesting.
I'm incredibly impressed
with you and your drive.
I'll offer you
$100,000 for 25%.
Cuban:
I'll make you an offer,
but I want you to say
yes or no right now, okay?
I'll give you $200,000
for 20%.
Noel:
So, I was this little kid, 18
years old, coming from Haiti
with no money and no directions
and no plans.
And now I'm striking a deal
with a Shark.
Um, this is the American dream.
Narrator: Next up is
a high?tech solution
that tackles
a common household chore.
