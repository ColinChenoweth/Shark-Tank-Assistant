Hello, Sharks.
My name is Olivier Noel.
I'm from Queens, New York.
Yeah.
My company is DNAsimple,
and I'm seeking $100,000
in exchange for 12.5%
of the company.
Sharks, experts are saying that
we are due for a new pandemic,
a catastrophic disease
that can devastate humanity.
And that's why
medical research
is even more important
than ever,
and that's where we come in.
DNAsimple is looking to make
genetic research
happen 10 times faster
so that cures to diseases
can be found 10 times faster.
And my company
is literally paying you
for your saliva sample.
It's all anonymous, and it
happens in four easy steps.
Number one,
you tell me about yourself
in two minutes
on our DNAsimple website.
Number two, we match you
to a research study
that's looking for
people like you.
Number three,
we ship you this little tube
to your house
with a prepaid stamp.
And number four, we give you $50
after you've returned
the sample back to us.
And you can do this
as many times as you can.
You heard correctly ??
we're paying you
for spitting in a tube.
Normally,
it's an extremely expensive
and very long process
for researchers
to get enough samples
for studies,
and our company is basically
making it simple.
We pay you for your spit,
researchers get
the samples they need,
and we get paid
for making it all happen.
It's a win?win for everybody.
Now, Sharks, who's ready
to join me in saving mankind?
I will come around and show you
what the kits look like.
Great.
Here's one for you.
Thanks, Olivier.
Let me give Lori hers.
Such a gentleman.
Thank you, Robert.
?You're welcome, Lori.
?Thank you, sir.
Hopefully, you do match
a study and get your $50.
Thank you very much.
You said that you just
spit into the tube,
send it back to you,
you will pay that person $50,
and they can do it
as often as they want?
If they get matched for a study.
Correct.
For example, if there are
10 researchers across the U. S.
that are looking for...
Female, this and that...
...someone age 20 to 45, that
fit in a particular profile.
No, get it right ??
20 to 25.
[ Laughs ]
In your case, 20 to 25.
Yes.
And so every time you do match,
you get a notification
that you can participate
to the study, and then
we send you a kit,
and every time,
you can get that $50.
So, Olivier, I only get $50
if you can match me to a study.
I will send this to you
after you've matched the study.
Okay. So, how much
are they paying you?
Typically, it would go around
$155 per sample.
So the research companies
are paying you $155.
You're paying $50 of that
right off the top...
Yes.
...for the sample.
Correct.
Any other cost to you?
So you make $100 ??
So, the kit. So, we have ??
We're making the kits in?house.
And what's it cost you
to make each one?
$12.50.
So, people
are answering online,
and they're telling you
about themselves,
and you're trusting that that
information is accurate, right?
How do you vet
that it is?
Okay.
So, for example, if I'm giving
this to a cancer researcher,
I could be a drug addict...
Yeah.
...which is gonna completely
skew the test.
Correct.
Basically,
I leave that to the researcher
Where's the competitive
advantage, Olivier?
Why is your company worth
$1 million today?
Well,
I've worked in the field,
so I understand
exactly what researchers want
and what can pass
and what will not pass.
I literally did this
kind of research for my PhD.
So I think that's
a competitive advantage there.
But, obviously, if we get
one of you Sharks on board,
that's a significant advantage.
What do you
really need the money for?
Do you need entry into
larger researcher facilities?
Do you need ??
Yes.
Until I have 100,000 people
in my database,
I can't go to Pfizer
and say, "I want to help you
lead that next big research
you're gonna do."
Some researchers,
in a five?year grant,
you spend three to four years
to recruit people.
Wow.
Literally,
there are studies that die,
because let's say
you're doing a study
where you'd need a
thousand blacks or Hispanics,
and I'm in
Hershey, Pennsylvania.
No offense ??
it would take about
a hundred years to get
those people, right?
[ Laughter ]
I mean, less than 5% of clinical
trials have minorities in them.
Some people are hard to find,
and so this idea,
that's our
competitive advantage.
So, look, I've just sat here
listening for ?? for a change
and not really contributed,
but having listened,
I think it's
really interesting.
I'm incredibly impressed
with you and your drive.
I'll offer you
$100,000 for 25%.
Cuban:
I'll make you an offer,
but I want you to say
yes or no right now, okay?
I'll give you $200,000
for 20%.
Noel:
So, I was this little kid, 18
years old, coming from Haiti
with no money and no directions
and no plans.
And now I'm striking a deal
with a Shark.
Um, this is the American dream.
Narrator: Next up is
a high?tech solution
that tackles
a common household chore.
