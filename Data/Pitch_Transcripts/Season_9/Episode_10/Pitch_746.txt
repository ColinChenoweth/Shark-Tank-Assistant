I'm Justin Crandall.
And I'm Bart Lomont.
We're from Dallas, Texas.
Cuban: What?!
Go, Dallas!
And we're seeking $500,000
for 5% of our company...
This better be good!
...Robin.
[ Laughter ]
Dang good.
So, every single year,
Americans spend $70 billion
on lawn?care services that are
star?? stuck in the Dark Ages.
Landscapers are
notoriously unreliable,
and they use dirty,
gas?powered mowers
that are
destroying the planet.
In the 21st century,
when I can get
a battery?powered car
that can drive itself,
why in the world is my lawn
still being mowed
by a guy
pushing a gas mower ?? Sorry ??
that is pushing
a gas mower
that emits more pollution
than 11 cars.
There has to be
a better way.
There is a better way.
Sharks, let me introduce you
to the future of lawn care.
Robin has launched
the world's very first
robotic
lawn?mowing service.
?Is it cutting now?
?It's cutting.
?It mulches it up?
?It's only cutting
a little tiny
piece of grass each time,
so it goes out and mows
a little bit every single day.
Right.
And the clippings actually fall
down and act as fertilizer,
so you need about 25%
less fertilizer for your lawn.
This thing has a wire that's
buried around the perimeter.
That's how it knows
where the edge of the yard is.
This is one of the machines
that our crews use
in order to do
the installation of the wire.
Herjavec: Oh.
Oh, so you're putting the wire
in like a dog fence.
Yep.
So ?? So, the first part of it
is, somebody comes in,
installs a wire
all the way around.
Yeah.
I assume there's
a sensor on the robot.
It goes to the wire,
and then it stops.
That's right.
We're taking proven
robotic mower technology
from Europe
and combining it
with high?quality, human crews
to deliver a more reliable
and environmentally friendly
lawn?care solution.
We have just begun
revolutionizing lawn care,
and we need one of you
on our side.
So, Sharks,
who's ready to cut a deal?
?[ Chuckles ]
?Right.
Where does the robot go
to plug itself in?
So, every robot has
its own docking station.
It follows its wire,
it goes home.
So there you can see it
backing off.
It's heading out
for a day of work.
And then, at the end of the day,
it goes and finds itself home.
He's so cute.
You guys aren't
selling the robot.
No.
Nope.
?You buy the robot from Europe.
?Correct.
And you're selling
the service around it.
Exactly.
Much like homeowners already pay
a landscaping service.
There are over
a million of these
installed in Europe
right now...
?Seriously?
?Are they services?
...and in the United States,
it's less than 10,000.
In ?? In Europe, though,
is it a service,
or are there
individuals owning them?
No.
Robin is launching the world's
first ever robotic lawn service.
What does one cost?
So, this one right here
costs about $1,800 to $1,900,
if you were a consumer,
to go out and buy it yourself.
Wow.
One thing that's really
important is that
we're charging you
$17 a week.
?$17 a week.
?$17 a week for mowing only.
?That's very cheap.
?How does it work?
So, you would call us or you
could just go to our website.
There's three plans ?? there's
$17 a week for just mowing,
if you want regular edging
and trimming,
that's $25 a week,
and if you want weeding,
shrub trimming, the whole deal,
it's $37 a week.
?That's all automated?
?Those pieces are not automated.
We have crews
that actually go out
and do the edging
and all the other work.
Got it.
That's what I wanted to know.
And we should mention
the history of Robin,
we started the company
a little over two years ago
as more of a "Uber for lawn
care" type of business.
We've built it
to where we do
10,000 jobs a month
and about $400,000 a month
in sales
with that business.
John: Wait a minute.
You have a current business that
uses traditional lawnmowers,
and it's like Uber ??
"Hey, need my lawn cut,"
boom, right?
Yeah.
How much are you doing
on that business, annually?
So, we are just under
a $5 million run rate
on the revenue side.
?Okay.
?Wow.
And we do about 10,000 jobs
a month in Houston,
Austin, and Dallas.
Okay. So this investment is in
that entire business, correct?
It's the whole thing.
Correct.
Okay. So you know what?
You don't look crazy now.
You look great.
Our goal is to convert
all of our customers
into robot customers.
It's more environmentally
friendly,
and, frankly,
it's better margin.
But the problem
isn't the margin.
The problem is
the capital cost, right?
What's it cost per customer?
So ?? Yeah ?? So, the
manufacturers are very motivated
to move this
into the U. S.
We have an agreement in which
we pay nothing up front,
we install the robot,
we charge you,
the customer,
for the first month,
we still don't pay
the manufacturer.
And then,
the next month,
we pay them $45 a month as
a lease model on the mower.
Isn't their grand incentive
to be that
they really want to sell them
to people here in America?
Crandall: They would love to
sell them to Americans,
but you sell them this robot,
great.
Now they look out there
and go,
"Okay. Now I'm going out
to do the edging,
and I'm gonna do the shrub
trimming and the weeding?"
And if you tried to hire
that same landscaper,
he's not gonna give you
a discount
just 'cause
he's not doing the mowing.
What's your own
personal background?
So, I grew up on a grain farm
in Indiana.
I enlisted in the military
shortly after 9/11.
I was studying agriculture.
I knew after those events
I had to do something.
I wanted
to serve my country.
?Thank you for your service.
?Thank you.
It was the greatest honor
of ?? of my life.
I was an operations
and logistics officer.
That's always been, uh,
you know, my interest.
So you're a logistics guy.
Correct.
That's your background.
The operations side,
and that's what I do, you know,
for Robin there. I like ??
Super important for this
business.
Yeah.
Justin,
what ?? what's your background?
So, I grew up in a small town
called Dowagiac, Michigan,
parents a couple teachers.
All my aunts and uncles
were teachers.
I think I'm the black sheep
'cause I went into business,
but that was where
my passion was.
Got my MBA at Harvard, and I
moved down to Austin in 2005,
joined some startups
down there,
and then ran sales for another
e?commerce?related business
from about half a million
to $15 million in revenue
over three years.
You're an online guy.
Yep. I met Bart through
a mutual friend of ours,
and we started talking
about this lawn?care idea.
I was like, "This is just
too ?? too good to pass up."
How much money have you raised,
and how big is the team?
So, we've raised
just over $3 million,
and we have 10 full?time
team members right now,
and then we have about
80 crews that we contract with.
What were
your sales last year?
Last year was about
$3 million.
Cuban:
What was your profit or loss?
We ?? So, we have lost,
'cause we were spending
very aggressively
to grow.
?Okay.
?How much did you lose?
Uh, last year was just over
a million we invested.
Ooh.
What's your burn rate right now,
monthly burn rate right now?
So, we're right about
$100,000 a month.
Does that break even yet,
or did that ??
How much is that losing?
So, we can break even
anytime we want.
All we have to do is stop
investing in acquisition.
This is not a cheap business
to get into.
This is an expensive business
to get into.
?I'll note that, too, every ??
?It is, though.
That's the problem.
But that's the barrier
to entrance.
Greiner: See, for me,
I'm a product person.
I look at this,
and I think,
"This is a consumer product
play more than a service."
Because of those reasons,
I'm concerned that
that will happen quicker
than I will see
a return on my investment.
And for that reason,
I'm out.
Okay.
Well, thank you.
Cuban: You guys, I think it's ??
it's a winner.
I just think
it's such a long horizon,
in terms of getting
a return on investment,
and you're gonna have to
raise so much more money
in order to scale.
Those are the challenges, and
so, for those reasons, I'm out.
Branson:
I love what you're doing.
I think these machines
are ?? are brilliant,
but I can't get close to
the $10 million valuation.
For that reason,
sadly, I'm out.
Herjavec: Yeah, you know,
all of the businesses
I drive down the street,
I see all the independent
little ma?and?pa garden people,
and I always wonder,
"Why hasn't somebody
consolidated that business?"
And to your credit,
in two years,
to get to $3 million in sales ??
I mean, that's fantastic.
You're losing a million dollars
in order to get there,
and ?? and I get it, but there's
got to be that tipping point.
I need to see it going,
"Boom!"
Don't know if I see it.
I'm out.
Yeah, you know,
when you first came out
with the 5% and all that crap,
I wanted to hammer you.
[ Both laugh ]
But then you started talking
about service to our country,
you know,
the rest of your family
is our most
underappreciated commodity,
which are teachers.
But on the other side,
just to lose
a million dollars a year,
as you're reinvesting ??
So, which side are you on,
Daymond?
Huh?
Which side are you on?
I'm on the outside
of the fence. I'm out.
Congratulations on
what you've accomplished.
?Congrats.
?Thank you.
Greiner: Thank you.
Crandall: It's a billion?dollar
market in Europe.
It will be
a billion?dollar market
in the U. S.
with us driving it.
Two or three years from now,
they're gonna say,
"Dang! Why did I
pass on Robin?"
Mark, can you
make sense of this?
Where does the Ubers
and the Twitters of the world,
why do they keep
raising money?
K?Keep getting more customers.
Just customer acquisition?
Because there's the point
where you win, right?
Amazon's the best
example of that,
but Amazon was losing money
up until last year.
Yeah, you know,
for years and years and years.
Cuban:
They're the ultimate startup.
If the company has
enough upside, then you say,
"You know what? Go for it.
I'll keep on giving you money."
Vir?Virgin Galactic,
you know,
we've invested over a billion
dollars now without any income.
I've got a company
that does metallic 3?D printing
with this unique formula.
He doesn't know it yet,
but he's gonna make his rockets
using this technology and it ??
We ?? We al??
We already are.
Maybe not that specific one,
but we already are.
Yeah.
I mean, it'll be this one.

to engage and inspire girls
to get into coding.
