Hi. My name is
Sharmi Albrechtsen.
I'm from Bethesda, Maryland,
and I'm asking $200,000 for 5%
of my company, SmartGurlz.
Sharks, we can all agree
that the latest robots
and drones are super cool,
but let's face it ??
it's a boys' market,
and it's not
of interest to girls.
In addition, in the U. S.,
we have a major shortage
of engineers
in a male?dominated workforce.
So how do we encourage
more girls into science,
technology, engineering,
and math?
We show them
how fun technology can be
by integrating it into the toys
they already play with.
I would like to introduce you
to SmartGurlz Siggy,
the world's first
coding robot for girls.
Albrechtsen: That's you,
and ?? and we put in you
in a gorgeous velvet suit.
?I like her!
Nice!
That's me with hair.
[ Laughs ]
So, Sharmi, the Siggy is the
Segway?like vehicle.
?Exactly.
?This is cool.
Okay.
We're doing puzzle 1,
and it says to move
50 centimeters forward
at 25% speed,
so you are going to
change the speed
by tapping right here to 25.
Yep.
And next change the amount of
centimeters from 25 to 50.
50.
And now you are going to
drag and drop the codes ??
first, the speed.
Okay.
And next we're going to
"drive on floor"
to see if we got it right.
And now you know how to code.
[ Laughs ]
?Yay! You did it!
?Yay!
You're such a geek, Richard.
You're ?? You're great teachers.
Thank you.
?How old are you?
?I'm 10.
?You're 10. And you?
?I'm 9.
And do you find it easy
or hard to do?
?It's easy.
?It's easy.
Sometimes for a beginner,
you can find it hard,
but when you get the hang of it,
it's pretty easy.
Herjavec:
To what degree can they ??
If they get more advanced,
can they actually
enter the commands?
Yeah. We've actually
allowed for kids to also see
the code that they've made,
so you can see
the JavaScript you created.
So it's basically
learning your ABCs
before you start,
you know, writing novels.
How did you
come up with this idea?
My daughter was
struggling in math.
I was just like,
"What can I do?"
And then
I walked into her room,
and I ?? I saw this, like,
line of dolls, and I thought,
"Can I connect robots
and dolls together
and make something
that's more inspiring for her?"
And that's how
SmartGurlz was created.
?How long ago was that?
?That was two years ago.
And what was your
next step to do that?
Okay. So, making something
self?balancing
is very difficult.
That's why you had to get it
moving first, yeah.
Yeah, exactly.
And we spent almost a year
doing the mathematics on this.
And our very significant
e?learning platform app,
SugarCoded,
is very special in the sense
that we put girls
in the center.
It's very story?based.
And did you release this onto
the market yet?
We've only been on the market
for less than six months.
Okay.
And we've done $250,000
worth of sales
in that really short
period of time.
?Wow.
?Nice.
How did you get your sales?
So, um, the first thing
that I did was actually,
I went to the World's Toy Fair
with six prototypes.
I walked away with 300 names
of different companies
who were interested
in the product, and I thought,
"You know what? This is gonna ??
This is gonna be big."
So then I started to
talk to some of them,
and I was able to actually get
some distributor agreements,
and that helped me
raise the funds.
So, the $250,000
is from one distributor,
a couple
of distributors?
It's for distributors,
also direct from retail,
also from Amazon.
So, where is it now, Sharmi?
Where can I see the ??
It's available
online on our website.
What does it sell for?
I don't think we ever asked you.
Yeah, so it sells for
$79.99.
And what does it cost you
to make it?
?About $18, landed.
?Okay. Wow. That's great.
Let us know why you think
the company's worth
$4 million at this point.
One of the things
is how difficult it is
to do
the balancing algorithm.
And it makes it very special.
We could actually license or
sell the balancing algorithm.
It's very unique.
I tell you, that self?balancing
thing is cool.
Doesn't it look like Richard
just met Lori, like...
[ Laughter ]
"Hey! You want some tea?"
Is this a patent on this?
We have a provisional patent
on our product.
I think this is valuable,
because out of the young ladies
that do go into engineering,
70% end up dropping out
of engineering
because they don't have other
females that they can relate to.
Yeah, exactly.
And I think if you get them
in early enough,
they will have
more females.
I'm interested
in licensing this thing out,
but you're asking a lot.
I would have to give you
the $200,000...
...for 30%.
Narrator:
All Sharks are still in.
Daymond is interested
in SmartGurlz,
an engineering toy
geared towards girls,
but he wants a much bigger stake
of the company
than the 5%
Sharmi came in offering.
I would have to give you
the $200,000 for 30%.
Okay. Well, that's ??
that's a lot.
Herjavec: Um, you know,
been in the toy business.
The Barbie doll, the 800?pound
gorilla in that business,
sales have declined
the last couple of years.
But they're still ??
I mean, one is sold
every three seconds, so...
There's nothing
to connect with them.
I applaud ?? I applaud
what you're doing,
but the incarnation
of that idea is this doll.
And I think it's ??
it's tough.
It's a tough,
tough business to be in.
Um...
Yeah, I don't want to
go back into it.
I'm out.
Greiner:
Let me tell you what I think.
I did a deal with Robert
that was a doll
that had imperfections ??
cellulite and one eye
that's crooked
and, you know, all these things,
like normal people.
What happened is
that Barbie came out
with the exact same thing ??
kind of crushed us.
I mean, this is
a completely different business.
If you go to the toy store
today, in the robotics section,
there is not one toy that's
specifically aimed at girls.
Such a smart idea,
but I really think
that Daymond's licensing offer
is the smartest thing,
'cause he's expert at that.
I have to be out.
It's so great
when you're learning things
and you don't know
you're learning things.
I mean, you're just playing.
Yeah, exactly.
Obviously, all of us would love
our kids to ?? to learn to code,
and I love
what you're doing.
I think it's ??
it's great.
But I don't think
I can add enough value
to your business to invest.
So, sadly, I'm out.
Okay.
Retail is brutal.
I like everything
about your company
except the fact that you have
a product that's in retail.
You're still vulnerable
to every new product
that comes in
trying to teach
robotics/programming/whatever
to girls.
I'm out.
Herjavec: So, Daymond,
you're at $200,000 for 30%?
Yeah.
Is there any wiggle room
in the...
You know,
the challenge is...
Let's just talk
industry standard.
A normal licensing agent is
normally around 25% to 35%.
They don't pay you anything.
They just get it
and go represent it.
I'm paying you $200,000
to go out and license it.
Make him a counteroffer, Sharmi.
What's your downside?
Would you come back with 20%?
You won't regret it.
We will do a great job for you.
I am so dedicated to this.
I?I'm planning
on the licensing part.
I'm gonna have to stay
at 30%.
You know...
25%?
We're meeting ??
For $200,000?
Yes, yeah. And it's so far ??
The idea is for us
to go and license it.
Yes, it is.
You got a deal.
?Yeah!
?Yay!
Thank you so much.
?Congratulations, Sharmi.
?Yay!
Thank you.
You sold it!
?Well done, kids.
?Thank you, guys.
?Congratulations.
?Bye?bye.
?Thank you.
?Thank you.
A deal with Daymond means
that we've got
a fantastic
licensing opportunity,
and that allows us
to get all girls coding.
He knows the toy business, and
we could do so much together,
and this is great.
I mean, I can't believe
I got a deal. Yay!
