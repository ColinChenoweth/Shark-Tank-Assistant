My name's Steve Markley,
aka "Captain Hooked."
And I'm James Arcaro,
the "Reel Assassin."
[ Laughs ]
We are here today
seeking $75,000
in exchange for 25% of our
company, Reely Hooked Fish Co.
Steve and I
are both Florida natives.
So we appreciate
a quality smoked fish dip.
Smoked fish dip
screams authentic Florida.
But we were sick and tired
of the mayonnaise?
or cream?cheese?
dominated dips.
And we knew we had to
revolutionize the way people
eat and look
at smoked fish dip.
We went to work and created
a one?of?a?kind recipe
that not only offers
an authentic flavor,
but it's healthy,
preservative?free,
and it tastes phenomenal.
Introducing...
Both:
Reely Hooked Smoked Fish Dip.
Our product is
a delicious smoked fish dip
with a health twist,
because we use Greek yogurt
as a base.
We also added apples
to sweeten up the flavor
and give it
some sophistication,
which has
never been done before.
We have a multi?day process
that includes
three primary phases
to deliver a superior product
to your table.
Both: Brine!
Smoke!
Mix it!
[ Laughter ]
Our smoked fish dip
is so fresh and unique.
Herjavec: Yeah!
And the best part is,
you don't have to feel guilty
for smashing
the entire container.
What?!
So, what do you say, Sharks?
Are you ready to help us
get the country
really hooked
on our smoked fish dip?
[ Laughter ]
Do it one more time!
Do it one more time!
?Yeah, all right.
?Do the smoked?fish thing.
Sharks, are you ready
to help us get the country
really hooked
on our smoked fish dip?
[ Laughter ]
?Whoo!
?I mean. Like...
Thank you!
I'll be here all day!
?That's funny.
?All right, Sharks.
Are you ready to get hooked up
with some samples?
?Yes!
?Yes!
That was the best ever!
?Wow.
We were working on it
quite a while.
I got to hang out
with you guys.
?Here we go.
?All right, so...
Lori.
?Thank you.
Are these all the same?
?Oh.
?Yes, it's the same dip.
?Wow!
?Yes.
?Mmm.
It's good.
Really good.
What kind of fish is this?
It's mackerel.
King mackerel is what we use
because it's so oily
that it smokes well.
What does the yogurt
do for it? Less calories?
?Yes.
?Yes.
Arcaro:
High protein, too.
So, in that container,
you're looking
at 245 calories.
245 calories?!
245 calories
in that whole container.
Only?
?That's pretty cool.
?Wow.
?And 32 gr??
?The whole thing?!
?Yeah.
?32 grams of protein.
?Wow.
?Absolutely amazing.
Thank you.
I thought
it was unbelievably delicious.
?Thank you.
?Thank you.
How did you guys
come up with this?
Okay, we are also,
right now,
full?time
wildland firefighters.
?Wow.
?Wow.
There's the boys.
There we are, hard at work.
?Wow!
?Wow.
So, we actually met
through the fire academy.
We realized we had a lot
of the same interests.
You know ?? involved
in businesses in the past.
We shared the same vision
for what we wanted in a company.
So we started running ideas
across each other.
And one ?? one day,
this guy's like
"[Nasal voice] Hey, man,
what about smoked fish dip?"
Yeah. In ??
In that ?? In that...
I'm like, "Oh, my God."
I sounded just like that.
[ Normal voice ] Yeah, yeah.
Well, that's how he sounded ??
So, you start the business.
What happens next?
We realized we didn't have
enough time or labor
to accommodate with the big
fire season we had in Florida.
And we said,
"We got to figure out
a better way to make money."
So we came up with a strategy
to go after breweries
because we think there's
a lot of foodies there.
Interesting.
Microbreweries.
Microbrewers and ?? and,
yeah, craft breweries.
And it was just a good fit
for us.
So we targeted
three breweries.
Did they take it?
All three.
And how much of your sales
are to craft brewers?
About pretty much al??
the whole thing.
We have one small retailer.
What sales do you have?
Okay. So...
S?So, right now,
we're actually
super?excited about it.
You know, we've sold $10,000
up to this point, but this is ??
$10,000?
Yes.
Yes, $10,000.
In how many months?
In about three months.
Herjavec: Steve,
what do you sell it for?
What's one package go for?
So, a container,
it goes for $10,
is what we started.
Ohh.
But we believe that $12
is actually
a better price point now.
?Yeah.
?Yeah.
?That's 10 bucks?!
?Yeah.
That's probably
the most expensive dip
in the entire cooler.
?Kevin.
Arcaro: It's not
the most expensive dip.
There is a product
that you ??
It's not even
comparable to ours,
and they're selling
at that price point,
and they are selling.
Cuban: Look, either they're
selling, or they're not.
Steve, what does it cost you
to make one?
Right ?? Right now, it's
costing us $4.50 a container,
but we can drive those prices
so far down
if we're buying the fish
in larger quantities,
we have the proper facilities,
and packaging.
S?S?? So, you're going
direct to the brewers?
Yes.
So, I cut you a check
for $75,000.
?Yeah.
?What happens tomorrow?
We would put that towards
the proper equipment,
a lit??
a better facility.
Do you need this money
to replace your salaries,
basically,
so you can focus on it?
Is that the idea?
Yes.
We want to move into
this business full time.
John:
You know, I fell in love
with just wanting
to hang out with you guys.
All right?
I love the product.
But at this point,
three breweries ??
You're really too early
for me to get it to scale,
and I would have to see
way more evidence
that you're capable
of scaling the company.
So I'm out.
Markley: Okay.
Thank you.
You're not answering
the question for me.
How do you go from $10,000
in sales to more?
Tell me
the next three steps.
We rescale it
with restaurants.
So, once we're in restaurants,
we want to be able to buy
some ??
some refrigerated trucks.
And I have no problem
going out
and selling this business
and ?? and getting...
You can't get this into Publix
or something like that?
We could.
We absolutely could.
We could.
Cuban: But they can't
keep up with it, yeah.
?We ?? We ??
?They couldn't take the order.
Yeah.
?Absolutely.
Greiner: I want to tell
you guys something.
I love your logo,
but I think
that people in our country
love to get behind
our everyday heroes,
people who go out
and risk their lives
every day for all of us.
If you could incorporate it,
like the "Hook and Ladder
Fish Company"
or something like that.
That's a great name.
Well, what are
you gonna do, Lori?
This product will sell.
People want it.
This is not
a saturated shelf space.
Look.
We have
an amazing opportunity here.
If it were entrepreneur
and fantastic flavor and taste,
then I have a lot of weight
on this side of the scale.
But if it was difficulty
of the business,
and can we really scale it,
and the scale goes
a little bit like this for me.
And it's a little heavier
on that more difficult side.
I'm so sorry, but I'm out.
$10,000 in sales.
It's nothing.
Yeah, but we ?? Listen.
Guys, let's be honest.
You threw a mackerel
in a blender
and said
it was worth $300,000.
I'm out.
We represent
the American Dream.
That's who we are.
That's what we are.
?You're right.
?That's for sure.
?You do.
?We're not coming here
with millions
of dollars of sales.
We're coming to you with
a product and an opportunity
to be at millions of dollars
in sales.
I understand
the path isn't easy.
It hasn't been
since I was a child.
Okay, guys, guys, guys.
Okay.
Okay.
Answer these questions 'cause
here's where I'm uncertain.
You're basically doing $1,000
per month, per restaurant.
About that. Correct.
And so if you can get
to 25 restaurants,
then you're gonna do
$25,000 a month,
plus whatever you do
on the side, right?
Yes.
Now, do you guys have enough
time to get the 25 restaurants?
Well, we're ?? Yes.
We're gonna work this thing
full time.
Okay.
Are you guys able to go slow?
We've been so patient
getting here.
Yes.
?If you stay patient...
?We're methodical.
I'm interested if you guys
can go from 3 to 5
to 7 to 10
and still prove that you're
gonna do $1,000 a week.
Mm?hmm.
Can you do that?
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
That's of interest to me.
Let me give you an example, too,
of just something
we go through
in this company.
Yo, yo, yo, yo.
Yeah.
I said I was interested,
right?
Yeah. Yes.
Yes.
Sometimes the best way to
close a deal is to shut up.
Right? Okay.
I'm gonna make you
a very Sharky offer.
Okay.
All right.
75K for 25%.
Well, that's what
they asked for.
I know.
So, are you guys in?
It's either
a "yes" or "no."
?You got a deal!
?Oh, my God!
?Whoo!
?Yeah!
?Oh, dude!
?There you go.
?Oh, my God!
?Reel in Mark!
Reel in Mark!
?Here, Mark. You ready?
?Ready.
?Ready?
Come on.
[ Laughter ]
Cuban: I don't think
I can jump like that anymore.
?Ah.
?I love it!
Congrats, guys.
Make this work.
?Oh, my gosh, man. Thank you.
?Congratulations, guys.
?My pleasure.
?Yeah, we will.
?Whoo?hoo?hoo?hoo!
?See you guys. Thank you.
All right! Whoo!
Whoo!
We did it, dude!
Yeah!
Whoo!
[ Laughing ] Oww!
Yes!
We got a deal
with Mark Cuban!
Yeah!
Whoo!
[ Both laugh ]
You ready?
Yeah, I'm ready.
Let's hook up America!
