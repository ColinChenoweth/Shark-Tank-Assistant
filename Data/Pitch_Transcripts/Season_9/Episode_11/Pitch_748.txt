Hello, Sharks.
My name is Joshua Esnard.
I'm here from
Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
Esnard: Yeah.
It's all created by me.
So, I did
all the packaging myself.
Tell us about you.
Sure.
I am actually an immigrant
from a developing country
called St. Lucia.
Maybe some of you
have visited.
?Yeah, it's beautiful.
?Of course.
?Beautiful country.
?Yes.
?Beautiful.
?My parents had me very young.
They were trying
to make a better life.
They moved to America.
But if you know anything about
old?school immigrant parents,
you're getting
one type of haircut.
Esnard:
60,000 units have left ??
Where did you sell
60,000 units?!
How did you do that?
I've found some affiliates
on YouTube
that had a heavy following
doing videos for hair.
