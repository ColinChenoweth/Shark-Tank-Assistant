Hello, Sharks.
My name is Joshua Esnard.
I'm here from
Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
And I'm the inventor
of The Cut Buddy.
Today, I'm seeking $300,000
in exchange
for 10% of my company.
Whoo!
Sharks, you know what?
Cutting your own hair...
Daymond, you ever cut
your own hair?
?I have.
?Cutting your own hair ??
That's no easy task.
One wrong move,
and it can all be over.
?[ Laughs ]
?[ Laughs ]
[ Sighs ]
Bro.
Oh, my goodness.
What did you do, man?
What happened?
Oh, man!
Pushed back his hairline.
?Oh!
?Oh!
Oh, no!
But you know what?
It doesn't have to be
this way...
because I created
the solution.
It's called The Cut Buddy.
Here you go, brother.
Use this instead.
All right?
The Cut Buddy
is the first multi?curve
hair?grooming guide tool
that allows you to edge up
and shape up your beard lines
and your hairlines
perfectly and quickly.
With three curves
and three straight edges,
you can look great,
regardless of your head shape
or your hair size.
See?
That's a better curve.
Keep using The Cut Buddy.
O'Leary: Yeah!
You should have used that
from the beginning.
All right! Oh, yeah.
All right?
And for our beautiful
bearded model friend here...
The Cut Buddy
works perfectly for beards.
All you need to do is put the
product against your beard line
and let it guide you
to the perfect look.
See, there's no more
second?guessing.
You can now cut your hair
with confidence.
You can look great.
People will stop you
on the street and say,
"Hey, who cuts your hair?!"
Great job, Joe.
Joe, who cut your hair?
[ Laughter ]
That The Cut Buddy difference
there.
So, Sharks,
who wants to cut a deal?
?Ohh!
?Oh.
I have some samples.
I want to see him cut
your hair, Kevin.
Listen, it's very,
very delicate lines.
[ Laughs ]
?There you go.
?Thank you.
Did you create
your little character here?
Esnard: Yeah.
It's all created by me.
So, I did
all the packaging myself.
Tell us about you.
Sure.
I am actually an immigrant
from a developing country
called St. Lucia.
Maybe some of you
have visited.
?Yeah, it's beautiful.
?Of course.
?Beautiful country.
?Yes.
?Beautiful.
?My parents had me very young.
They were trying
to make a better life.
They moved to America.
But if you know anything about
old?school immigrant parents,
you're getting
one type of haircut.
And that's the buzz cut.
So, I was getting ready
to go to middle school.
I wanted to get the girls.
I wanted to wear
my Platinum FUBU.
No doubt, no doubt.
Good man.
And I wanted my haircut ??
my haircut to look nice.
So I didn't want
my dad cutting my hair.
I tried to cut my own hair.
And I jacked it up many times.
So I went and started designing
all kinds of products
that can help me.
And I actually cut up
my dad's folders
and created the first Cut Buddy
when I was 13 years old.
?Good for you.
?Wow.
I actually sat on this invention
for 15 years
before I patented it.
What was the catalyst to go
from letting it lie
to starting the business?
So, my girlfriend and I,
we're trying to move
the treadmill into the garage,
and it won't fit.
So we took the door
off the hinges,
fit the treadmill in,
and then she's like, "All right,
put the door
back on the hinges."
I'm like,
"Uh, that was a lot of work."
She's like, "You never
finish what you start."
It hit my heart, and I thought
I wasn't showing up for my life.
So I went to my inventor book.
And ?? Hold on.
Esnard:
60,000 units have left ??
Where did you sell
60,000 units?!
How did you do that?
I've found some affiliates
on YouTube
that had a heavy following
doing videos for hair.
And all of a sudden, my sales
went from 20 sales per day
to 100, 200, 400 sales per day.
And I went viral on Facebook,
hit 11 million views.
Wow!
What do you sell it for?
I sell it at $14.95.
And we wholesale
at the $8.50 price point.
What does it cost you?
It's $2 with the back of it.
Daymond:
And where does it retail?
Is it hair places
like Sally's?
Or is it Walgreens, CVS,
or all of them?
I met with Sally's.
I'm just waiting basically
for them to offer me a P. O.
Target and Walmart
has brought us on as a dot?com.
But, yeah, that's the retail
area that we want to go to.
But most of the sales now
are direct to consumer?
Correct. Maybe 20% of my sales
are to wholesale clients,
and then the rest
are right to consumer.
What do you need us for?
Because...
I think that the mentorship
that you guys can give me
as a strategic partner
can help me.
You have to realize
that I'm an inventor.
I invented a product
that went viral.
So, basically, I had a baby
that's learning how
to drive a car now. I ??
With $300,000, you can go
and date 17 mentors
at $10,000 a month,
then pick the one you want.
?Yeah.
?So...
And ?? And you don't
have to share the rest
of your profits...
Well...
...for the rest of your life
with it.
Daymond, are you trying
to talk yourself out of a deal?
I ??
I'm not trying to talk myself
out of a deal,
but I want to ask the question,
because if he turns around,
and we can't do better
than he's doing for him,
what's gonna happen?
I heard him ask for $300,000.
So I'm prepared to make you
an offer.
It's not really a business.
It's a product
with a good entrepreneur
that hustles underneath it.
I'll give you
the $300,000.
What I want is $1.50
from every unit
until I've made back
a milskie.
Basically, just over
three times on my money.
Then that goes away.
And just so I can keep
my interest in you,
I want 5% of the company.
Josh,
I'll throw a sweetener in.
Josh, wait a minute.
I'll throw a sweetener in.
If you do this deal with me,
I'll grow my hair back.
[ Laughter ]
?Oh, man!
?You know.
Just to clear the deck,
I'm out.
Thank you, Mark.
Congratulations, man.
It's just...
I could have helped you
re?billionize.
?"Re?billionize"?
?Ah.
That's a good one.
Josh, I think
it's a good product.
I don't ?? I don't
really understand it,
to be honest with you.
And ?? And it ??
it worries me that ??
To me,
it's so self?evident.
You got to go online,
you got to hustle it out there,
and you want
to go into retail.
I don't want to have
that argument with you.
I'm out.
I?I honestly think that
this will be as common as a comb
in your house
in the next five years.
Maybe.
For sure.
Daymond: As far as templates,
that means there are
other templates out there?
So, I've been knocked off
more than 700 times.
Similar products?
O'Leary:
Josh, you know there's a risk.
But are there other ones
prior to that?
?That's really staggering.
?No. I'm the first.
I'm the father of the industry,
and they caught on to it
and started knocking ??
Being knocked off
just tells you ??
It's a confirmation
of the product, okay?
I'm all right with that.
But I made you an offer,
and you're still talking
to people
that don't seem that excited.
Daymond, I see you're quiet,
and I...
What are you doing, Daymond?
You're one of my idols.
And I love your story.
Is there any way
that you and Kevin
would work together in this?
Wh?? Work with Kevin?
Why would I do that?
I mean,
he's a beautiful guy.
I have more hair
than he has!
[ Greiner laughs ]
No matter what side
of the table we're up at here,
we're ?? we're here to fight
for the entrepreneur, right?
So I don't want to put
a burden on you,
but if there are places
you think I can add value ??
Of course
I relate to the product.
You know, you're gonna be
a new dad right now.
Every decision you're
gonna make from this point on
is not gonna be
about you.
It's gonna be about
two other very important people.
Are you thinking
about that?
Because the day you become
a father, life changes.
I just want to do good
for my child
[Voice breaking]
who's being born.
And I just...
Sometimes I just feel lost
'cause I feel like
I'm just an inventor
and I'm not really
a business owner, totally.
I work my ass off,
but sometimes I just feel lost.
And I feel like you guys
are, like, the flashlight
that can help me get
into wherever
that I need to be, you know.
I'm just gonna
let you know ??
There's 28 million small
businesses in this country.
And over half of them
are operated
by one?man
and one?woman shops.
And they're the backbone
of our country.
They're more valuable
than people ever
give them credit to be.
So, you're here already.
You know,
I've got an offer for you.
