Hello, Sharks.
My name is Callie Christensen.
And I'm Kelly Oriard.
We are here seeking $175,000
for a 5% stake
in our company, Slumberkins,
Sharks, think back
to when you were 5 years old.
How many of you had a favorite
stuffed animal or blanket
that was so special you
just couldn't live without it?
That one thing
that you took everywhere.
And it made you feel safe.
As moms and educators,
we know that kids attach to
things that comfort and soothe.
So we designed
a line of cuddly creatures
that are a hybrid between
a stuffed animal and a blanket.
We call it a lovey.
We use only
the softest materials.
And kids just can't help but
snuggle up to our Slumberkins.
They're magical friends
that last through lifetime,
giving a feeling of safety,
love, and security throughout.
Now, because I'm a school
counselor and she's a teacher,
we knew that Slumberkins
could also help teach
important life skills.
So each one comes with a book
that focuses on those skills
that we teach
in the school every day.
We are cuddly creatures
with intention.
And we are on a mission
to promote positive skills
in the next generation
and beyond ??
one cuddle at a time.
Who's ready
to get their snuggle on?
Yes, of course.
Okay.
We have the Yeti.
Thank you.
Pink! [ Laughs ]
Thank you.
What did you get, Daymond?
Oriard: Daymond,
you're holding our Yeti.
His story is all about
a mindfulness practice
for children.
Thank you.
Lori, you're holding our Fox.
Aww.
The story focuses on helping
kids cope with big change.
Mr. Wonderful,
you have our shark.
His story is
all about conflict resolution.
And we would hope that you could
learn something from that story.
O'Leary: Wow.
Conflict resolution.
Oriard: Mark,
you're holding our Bigfoot.
His story is all about positive
affirmations and self?esteem.
Aww.
And, Robert,
you're holding our Sloth,
who's all about relaxation.
Sloth!?
?Yeah!
?Relaxation.
Oh, no!
[ Laughter ]
I'll take Sloth.
Okay.
I'll take Sloth.
?Would you like a Yeti?
?Now, Robert...
?Yes!
?Oh. Okay.
?Robert.
?Robert, stop being bad.
?Get the man a Yeti.
?Slow down, slow down.
I can totally see you
as a little kid!
Yeah, you need some
conflict resolution, Robert.
?Thank you.
?Wow!
"Let's help Hammerhead calm down
and then make it right."
So, how did you come up
with the way that it looks,
the texture, all of that?
We really wanted to make
something that was more unique
than anything out there
on the market.
And, also, we use a fabric
that isn't typically found
in the toy industry.
It's more
in the fashion industry.
We've been in business
for about 18 months.
Callie and I were making these
by hand in our homes,
taught ourselves to sew,
put some online,
and found
that we had a demand.
We each invested $200
into fabric, to begin.
Yes.
So that was our ??
That's it?
Yeah.
?So you're all in?
?For $200?
?Yes.
?Yes.
?$200.
?Yeah.
Oriard: As an educator,
we were all in.
?That's what I mean.
?$200. Yes.
We were pulling from savings
for that.
So, the next six months
was really about trying
to meet the demand
that we had created
through our social media.
And so we started hiring
local seamstresses
and created our own cuddly
creature manufacturing empire
in Vancouver, Washington.
What do you sell it for?
So, currently, they retail
between $44 and $52.
?Wow.
?Wow!
Greiner: Wow!
What's it cost you
to make one?
Currently, they cost $15
to make.
[ Whistles ]
That's a lot!
How did you create
the demand?
It's all been driven
through social media.
We have a very engaged
Instagram following.
It almost sells itself
once a mom gets it,
and then she takes a picture
of their ?? her sleeping...
Her kid.
...child with it.
What are your sales?
Well, in our first year,
we did $200,000.
And, this year,
what do you think?
This year,
we're projected to do over ??
a little over half a million.
?Nice!
?Wow.
Wow.
We basically have capped out
on what we can produce here
in the United States, and...
Oh, so you're constrained
on inventory?
We're constrained
by what we are making.
So you're not manufacturing
these overseas?
No.
Knowing what our sales
are at,
we completely know
that our valuation
might be a little high,
but it's because we know
that we're capped out
in this production holding,
as you will, for right now.
So you're asking
for what you need,
not necessarily what
the business is worth?
Well, we think
it's worth that
because we did not
meet demand this year.
We believe that we are going
to sell a lot more in 2018.
Okay.
And we actually have solved
that problem
and found
an amazing production partner.
It'll reduce our costs
by 2/3.
Really?
So, your costs
are gonna be, what, $6?
Mm?hmm.
Are you planning to stay
only on your website?
No. So, our goal is to get
into the hands and hearts
of as many children
as we can.
And so, that's part of
why we're here.
But what's your vision
for how to do that?
What ?? Do you want
to go into retail?
Yes. We would like
to move into retail,
but this is
part of why we're here.
We know that you guys
have expertise.
Premium plush
is really tough.
Cuban: Yeah,
but, guys, guys, look.
This brings
a fundamental question.
Yes.
Your margins are gonna go up,
let's say, 80%,
'cause you're selling directly
from your website, right?
?Mm?hmm.
?Mm?hmm.
That's a good thing.
You know?
And if you keep on ??
So you're recommending
not to go to retail?
Well, that ?? And that's
my question, right?
You're making a killing.
Mm?hmm.
And if you slow?grow it
and keep things
a little bit constrained,
you're gonna make really,
really, really good money.
When you try to scale
like that,
a whole new set
of problems arise.
Yep.
A whole new concept
of how you're funding it
and how you're going
to pay for that.
Are you sure
you want to do that?
Yes.
You might not make
as much money.
Your profits could go down.
Now, with our costs
being lowered,
we feel it's important
that we do make it
an accessible product
because of our history
as educators.
So you want to lower
your price?
We would like to, yes.
Okay.
Do you think it's the
right business decision?
What would you lower it to?
I think that's where
we need expertise and help
moving forward so we enter
the retail market strategically.
Would you rather reach
more kids or make more money?
At this point,
we want to move forward
and reach
as many people as we can.
That's fair enough.
But then you have to change
your business plan,
because you can't compete
at $52 in the plush category.
I'm going to guess
that 99% of plush toys
sell for under $9.99.
This is the 1%, okay?
Yeah, but this isn't
just a plush toy.
You're teachers.
You've built a brand.
It's online.
People are talking about it.
And they're giving you
52 bucks.
We're saying we want
to very strategically enter
into a relationship
in the bigger space
to make them
more accessible.
Like, we're really interested
in ?? in Amazon.
Well, that's still online, yeah.
That's still online.
Yeah.
?Yeah.
?Yeah.
And, you know,
it's not ?? It's ??
It's not for us
to write your business plan.
We're just trying
to give you advice and...
?Yeah.
?Yeah, I know.
?You can assess risk, Daymond.
?At the end of the day...
?We appreciate it.
?Huh?
?You can assess risk.
?Yeah.
I'm gonna tell you
my risk.
I was in the plush business
a couple years ago.
And I realized
how brutal it is.
And the companies
that are in this area,
they are making them
in mass,
they're driving
the price down.
And I do not want to take
that journey again,
because I'm still licking
my wounds from the first time.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It's always bad
when the Sharks
are redefining
your business plan.
But it's painfully obvious
to me the only way this works
is if you stay up there
in the 1% or 2%
and you just keep doing
what you're doing ??
expanding your story online
and selling direct to customers.
It's not worth
$3.5 million.
It's not even worth
a million yet.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you, Kevin.
Cuban: Hey, guys.
Look, what you've
accomplished so far is great.
And, actually,
your scarcity
has worked to your favor
significantly.
The hard part comes next.
And you've got
so much work to do.
Yes.
You've got product,
you've got pricing,
you've got distribution,
you've got scale, and you've
got your social mission...
Yep.
...which is great.
The problem
is that 5% of the company
to try to help you do
all those things ??
You'd have to be
a $200 million company
before I saw any return
on my time.
So I have to say
I'm out.
Thanks, Mark.
Thank you.
But congratulations on
what you've accomplished.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I love your mission.
And I like the idea
of soothing things for kids.
But, as an investment
for me,
I like things that are
a little bit more unique.
I don't ever feel it's
as wise to go up against
a lot of competition
in the same arena.
Yeah.
Mm?hmm.
And so, while I love
both of you,
I don't love
all the competitiveness,
so I'm out.
Thank you, Lori.
Thank you, Lori.
I think
it's a great mission.
And from a great mission
comes a great product.
Mm?hmm.
I don't know
why you want to expand it.
I believe
in what you're doing today.
I believe
in this direction.
Okay.
Okay.
It's a slow burn!
Mm?hmm.
You're not gonna sell
as much as you want,
but you're gonna make
more money!
Yeah.
Cuban: And you'll be able
to do more things.
?Mm?hmm.
?Yeah.
Herjavec:
I can't get in on it today.
Thank you for being teachers,
but I'm out.
Thank you.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you guys
for your time.
?Congratulations, guys.
?Thanks for your time.
?You guys have been great.
?Thank you.
?Thank you.
?Thank you, guys.
52 bucks for a plush toy?
That's extraordinary.
But it's not a plush toy.
And they're doing
a great job online.
Well, in the end,
I have bad news for you ??
It's a plush toy.
Oriard: I really thought
somebody would understand
the mission behind it
and want to get it
to as many kids
[Voice breaking]
as ?? as we can, you know.
Yeah.
[ Breathes deeply ]
We're still gonna do it.
We're gonna not stop.
No.
