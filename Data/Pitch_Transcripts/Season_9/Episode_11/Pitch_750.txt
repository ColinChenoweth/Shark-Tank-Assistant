Sharks, my name
is Alexander Simone.
I'm an inventor
from San Francisco.
I'm here today seeking $100,000
as an investment
for 5% of my company,
Pronto Concepts.
My invention solves a problem
that millions of wine lovers
all over the world
face every day.
Wine lovers
love their wine chilled.
They also love their wine
in the moment.
But the best spontaneous
beverage, ironically,
Simone: Excellent.
[ Laughter ]
?You chevalier.
?I'll drink to that.
To the chevalier.
?C'est tu bon.
?Cheers.
I'll have some of the ??
some of the warm wine.
?Absolutely.
?Yeah.
Okay, can you tell us
where you're at with sales?
Simone: Yes.
So, we just finished
our Indiegogo crowdfunding
campaign yesterday,
Herjavec:
Alexander, look...
you know, a great product
that you're
very passionate about
doesn't make
a great company.
Okay, Alexander.
I don't care what you think
it's worth, all right?
I know the challenges of
getting into the wine business.
There's tons of competition,
of Alexander's wine?cooling
product, ProntoBev.
Greiner: All right.
Hold on.
Now, listen.
Alexander, you do have an offer.
What do you want to do?
There's no way
I have any flexibility.
I've been doing this
my whole life.
Look ?? Well ??
Man, you can't give up
50% of your company, Alexander.
?I'm s?? It's not a company!
?But it's a ??
It's Alexander's discussion
with Kevin.
Kevin, if ?? if I gave you
50% of my company...
O'Leary: Right.
...it would be doomed
from that moment.
Why?
Because I need equity
to play around with
so I can raise more money
if I need to.
I gave you 50%.
50% is ?? is not ??
Is there a better partner
than me?
Is there?
20%.
No!
Are you...
No.
No, no, no.
Look.
Simone:
How do I raise the money, Kevin?
If you're gonna be my partner,
I ?? This needs to happen.
Where are I gonna get
the other $100,000?
I get diluted, too.
So we all ??
Maybe I'll go in
on that route.
Maybe I'll put more money
into it. But I'm starting ??
Yeah, now he owns
less than 50%.
It's not his company anymore.
That's his point.
Yeah. Then you're
gonna take more.
Cry me a river, Mark.
Yes or no, Alexander?
You won't budge at all?
O'Leary: None! Zero!
'Cause you're giving me
no wriggle room here.
It's binary ?? yes or no.
This is your moment.
You decide.
What's your next product,
Alexander?
Our next product
is a martini shaker...
What are you talking
to him for? He's already out.
...that ??
that chills martinis.
So ?? So, you need...
You know, the problem
with the martini business
is, wine ?? w??
...to get into
the martini side of it,
All right, Alexander.

Simone: I cannot believe I just
made a deal with Mark Cuban.
He went out first.
I was so disappointed.
