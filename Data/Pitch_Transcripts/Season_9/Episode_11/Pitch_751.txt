Sharks, my name
is Alexander Simone.
I'm an inventor
from San Francisco.
I'm here today seeking $100,000
as an investment
for 5% of my company,
Pronto Concepts.
My invention solves a problem
that millions of wine lovers
all over the world
face every day.
Wine lovers
love their wine chilled.
They also love their wine
in the moment.
But the best spontaneous
beverage, ironically,
requires the most preparation
and foresight.
That's why I invented ProntoBev.
Simone: Excellent.
[ Laughter ]
?You chevalier.
?I'll drink to that.
To the chevalier.
?C'est tu bon.
?Cheers.
I'll have some of the ??
some of the warm wine.
?Absolutely.
?Yeah.
Okay, can you tell us
where you're at with sales?
Simone: Yes.
So, we just finished
our Indiegogo crowdfunding
campaign yesterday,
and we raised $54,000.
What were you looking for?
$25,000.
And what does it cost?
On crowdfunding, it's $89.
When we're actually selling it,
we'll sell it for $129.
Ohh!
The cost is $22 to make.
So, if you're positioning
this product
as a wine chiller, basically,
why do you have to put it
back in the bottle?
The way we can get it
to chill so quickly,
it basically is like
a cannon blast of cold.
That's ??
You're saying it freezes
if you leave it inside it?
It won't freeze, but the
temperature will keep dropping.
With any alcoholic drink,
there's a perfect temperature.
And just to let you know,
all the temperatures
are written
right on the packaging.
Thank you very much.
So, you seem to know
a lot about wine.
What's your background?
I actually studied
entrepreneurship.
Where at?
At Arizona State.
I came up with this idea,
like I said.
I've worked for other start?ups
in the past,
but I've known my entire life
that I was gonna do
something like this.
So, I have no idea
why people
aren't really going over
this valuation.
So, let's look at the
crowdfunding platform you're on.
You only sold
$54,000 worth.
In two months.
The first two months.
Do you have some other stuff
that's gonna give us a reason
to get
to a $2 million valuation?
There is another reason.
So, one
of our biggest competitors,
they're also a wine chiller,
but they take way longer,
and there are other drawbacks
to the product
that ProntoBev has a lot
of advantages over.
What does
the competition cost?
What does it cost?
They charge $80.
They're doing how much
in business?
$10 to $20 million a year.
$10 million to $20 million.
That's a big ?? big swing.
?That's a big range.
?Yeah.
But ?? So, you believe
that that's why
you're worth $2 million?
I see our product as being
worth far more than that.
All right.
You've been watching
"Shark Tank."
Where did we go wrong?
Why do you think
we would ever invest
in a company at this level
with
a $2 million valuation?
This company has only one
direction to go, and that's up.
Well, then I've failed you,
because I, obviously,
am not giving
the right lessons here
and the right information...
because I don't want you
to go into another room
and make a stupid mistake
like that.
This valuation is crazy.
I'm out.
Cuban: Okay, one
of the challenges I have
when working
with inventors ??
When you're an inventor first
and an entrepreneur second,
you want to invent.
Yeah.
But the harder part
is turning it into a company
that's profitable enough
to make it worthwhile.
Valuing this company
at $2 million ??
I just don't see that.
I don't see it going there.
And so for those reasons,
I'm out.
Oh, that hurts, Mark.
You would have been
a great partner.
Sorry.
I appreciate that.
All right. I understand.
Herjavec:
Alexander, look...
you know, a great product
that you're
very passionate about
doesn't make
a great company.
And your valuation
isn't trivial.
It's just way too soon
for me.
I mean, I?I'm out,
but I?I think the only person
that would be interested
would be a wine expert.
What do you call
a wine expert?
A ?? A?
Chevalier du Tastevin.
?Hey!
?Ohh!
A great reason
to toast.
Okay, Alexander.
I don't care what you think
it's worth, all right?
I know the challenges of
getting into the wine business.
There's tons of competition,
and very little of it's
proprietary.
But I see the merit of it.
I would use it.
There's more good news ??
I'm gonna make you an offer.
And it's the only offer
I'm gonna make.
I'm not gonna negotiate,
okay?
You've got
to be kidding me.
I'm gonna go
and give you $100,000.
I want 50%.
of Alexander's wine?cooling
product, ProntoBev.
Greiner: All right.
Hold on.
I have some good news
and some bad news.
What do you want first?
Give me the bad news first.
Bad news first.
I'm out.
[ Cuban laughs ]
Lori! What's the good news
from that?
I'll tell you
the good news.
The good news is, I think
you have something clever.
And I think
that it has merit.
I went out because I think
that there's a lot
of time and education
and learning and tweaking
for you to get
to a price point
that I think
will be a ?? a hero.
But I?I do think...
Are you still out?
...you have the potential
to get there
and you have
a member of the...
Chevaliers.
...Chevaliers du Tastevin!
?Oh!
?Hey! Give me a refill.
Now, listen.
Alexander, you do have an offer.
What do you want to do?
There's no way
I have any flexibility.
I've been doing this
my whole life.
Look ?? Well ??
Man, you can't give up
50% of your company, Alexander.
?I'm s?? It's not a company!
?But it's a ??
It's Alexander's discussion
with Kevin.
Kevin, if ?? if I gave you
50% of my company...
O'Leary: Right.
...it would be doomed
from that moment.
Why?
Because I need equity
to play around with
so I can raise more money
if I need to.
I gave you 50%.
50% is ?? is not ??
Is there a better partner
than me?
Is there?
20%.
No!
Are you...
No.
No, no, no.
I take you out of the
wastelands, the darkness.
I bring you to the light.
Darkness...light.
?Oh, my.
That's what's gonna happen.
That's what's going to happen.
You have a high probability
of making money,
versus you walk out the door
with ?? without a deal.
And you are so dead to me.
I won't even remember
this thing.
I'm willing to negotiate,
but I need to keep some equity,
"A," for myself...
You're right!
Yeah, don't be greedy.
...'cause I should have
the majority...
That's Business School 101.
...and, "B," so I can go
and raise the other $100,000.
I have interested people
in the other $100,000.
Look, if you had come
more advanced
with sell?through and proven
sales, that's different.
I would have give you
more credit
and maybe had flexibility.
You have none of those things,
okay?
Kevin,
are you stuck at the 50%?
I said at the beginning, Robert,
I have no flexibility!
Then give him $200,000
or $250,000.
No!
Greiner: Yeah, give him
the extra $100,000 he needs.
Look.
Simone:
How do I raise the money, Kevin?
If you're gonna be my partner,
I ?? This needs to happen.
Where are I gonna get
the other $100,000?
I get diluted, too.
So we all ??
Maybe I'll go in
on that route.
Maybe I'll put more money
into it. But I'm starting ??
Yeah, now he owns
less than 50%.
It's not his company anymore.
That's his point.
Yeah. Then you're
gonna take more.
Cry me a river, Mark.
Yes or no, Alexander?
You won't budge at all?
O'Leary: None! Zero!
'Cause you're giving me
no wriggle room here.
It's binary ?? yes or no.
This is your moment.
You decide.
What's your next product,
Alexander?
Our next product
is a martini shaker...
What are you talking
to him for? He's already out.
...that ??
that chills martinis.
So ?? So, you need...
You know, the problem
with the martini business
is, wine ?? w??
...to get into
the martini side of it,
and to do this and get it out,
you need another $100,000.
Right.
How are you gonna get
the other $100,000?
We have people
who are interested.
I know I can get
the other $100,000.
Okay.
I know I can.
I'll give you $100,000
for 25%,
contingent that you raise
the other $100,000.
Yeah.
Done.
Greiner: Whoo!
[ Laughs ]
Thank you, Mark.
You got to work
your ass off, okay?
I will, I will.
All right.
I really will.
All right, Alexander.
?[ Scoffs ]
Simone: I cannot believe I just
made a deal with Mark Cuban.
He went out first.
I was so disappointed.
And he came back in
after listening to everything.
And this terrible deal
I'm trying to make with Kevin.
And it was ?? It's ??
This is the best day of my life.
?Are you upset?
?No, not at all.
I would have never done it
for less than 50%.
Kevin, you saved $100,000
that you can spend in the...
Chevaliers du Tastevin!
?Yay!
?Yay!
?Whoo!
O'Leary: Cheers.
