? Coco Taps
will get you right on track ?
? Great taste ?
?Wow!
?? Less waste, too ?
?Wow!
? Coconut water
just flows right through ?
? And it's gotta be fresh,
right from the tree ?
? Fresher than fresh
is the best way to be ?
[ Chuckles ]
? No mess,
and no stress, too ?
? Gotta tap your thirst,
coco dreams come true ?
Coco Taps. Yeah.
[ Cheers and applause ]
?Good job.
?Aloha, Sharks!
All: Aloha!
My name is Coco Vinny.
I'm from Long Beach,
California,
and I'm the founder and chief
coconut in charge at Coco Taps.
?[ Chuckles ]
?I'm asking for $150,000
for 10%
of soon?to?be our company.
Close your eyes for a minute
and imagine we're on our very
own Hawaiian coconut plantation.
Ahh.
The sun is shining.
The birds are singing.
You feel that ocean breeze
on your skin.
And what's even better
is you've got a fresh?tapped
coconut in your hands.
Now, Coco Rey?Rey and I ?? We're
gonna get you all tapped in.
Come on, Coco Rey?Rey.
Aloha.
Whoo!
Now, Coco Ro, here you go.
Lovely.
Thank you, buddy.
?Thank you so much.
?Coco Lo?Lo!
?Coco Lo?Lo.
?Coco Lo?Lo and Coco Ro?Ro.
?This is Coco B.
?Here. Cheers.
?Thank you, darling.
?Salut.
?Coco Ro.
?Coco Ro.
?Wow.
?Oh! Wow!
Now, Sharks,
drinking coconut water
out of plastic bottles
and cans
tastes old and stale.
I'm sure
now that you're tapped in,
we can all agree that drinking
fresh, right from the source
is the best way
to relax and hydrate.
You know, we've all seen some
crazy ways to open a coconut.
Banging! And hammering!
And chopping!
You could lose a finger.
We've even seen
some of these crazy tools
pitched right here
in the Tank.
But what we've created
is the only 100% made in USA
coconut water system.
It allows you to quickly
and safely tap a coconut.
Let me just show you
how it works.
You take the Coco Tapper,
you remove the safety cover,
and you make a hole right
in the coconut like so.
Now, once a hole
is in the coconut,
you take the Coco Tap and you
thread it in counterclockwise.
Now, the end of the Coco Tapper
is like a wrench.
And you just tighten it on
like so.
Now, once the tap is secured
into the coconut,
it's fully re?sealable.
Our lab results show
that the fresh?tapped coconut
will last up to four weeks
in the refrigerator.
Now, Sharks, our mission
is to get everyone tapped in to
this ultimate vacation beverage.
All you got to do is say,
"Yes!"
and we'll start bringing in
boatloads of coco cash.
What are your sales?
In our first year,
we did almost a quarter million
dollars in revenue, and ??
How long ago was that?
That was
just January of 2016.
In 2017, we're trending
double for where we are last ??
for where we were ??
?What's the product?
Is it just a tap?
Wait, Robert.
Robert, Robert, Robert.
We sell
two products currently.
We have a do?it?yourself
tap kit,
and we have the branded
tapped beverage line,
which is in over 20 resorts
on the Las Vegas strip.
Got it. It's a tap kit
and a finished coconut drink.
Yes.
?Yes.
?And how does it break out?
Is it 50?50?
So, right now
our current sales
are 80% tap?branded beverage
and 20% kit.
So you're selling
a self?contained coconut drink.
How often do you have to go
around the Las Vegas strip
delivering to the 20 resorts?
So, we're delivering daily.
So, we have, you know,
major corporations ??
Caesars, MGM Mirage,
Cosmopolitan, Wynn, Encore.
How much do you charge
for them, Coco Vinny?
A case ?? our costs ??
tapped, branded, everything,
ready to deliver ?? $27.
And then
what are you selling it for?
$45 per case right now.
Okay, how many cases
do you typically deliver
to a resort at one time?
A minimum order
is 5 to 10 cases.
So you're making $90 or $180
per customer per delivery.
Yes, sir.
So, tell us
about your background.
Why did you
come up with this?
So, I'm a 6'5" Mexican Jew
standing in front of you today.
Nice!
[ Laughter ]
Isn't everybody?
I'm a problem solver.
I?I?I started solving problems
when I'm really young.
Really, I was a fat kid
in the very beginning.
I was challenged
with my weight.
And I overcame that.
I lost 75 pounds.
?Good for you. Congrats.
?Good for you.
So, basically, an Indonesian
friend of mine said, "Try this,"
and I was like,
"I don't like coconut water,"
and he said, "Just try it."
Once I was tapped in,
it was over.
Hammer and knife every time
after my workouts.
I broke my stepdad's knife.
I said, "We got to fix this."
So I made the coconut
re?sealable,
created the tool kit.
Took me a year and a half, R&amp;D,
patents, manufacturing,
made in USA, beat China
on their price ?? everything.
I see a massive
untapped market.
The cruise industry ??
60% of their revenue
of 24 million passengers a year
are drinking.
?On a ?? On a cruise ship?
?60% ??
Vinny, that's not the challenge,
right?
The challenge is you're
a delivery service, right?
You've got to deal
with the logistics of delivery.
How do you scale that?
We invented a whole high?volume
production system
that we set up in California
and Nevada already,
and we're literally five minutes
from the casinos.
Vinny, I'm not worried about
the production issue.
Greiner: Producing it ??
When you say ??
How do you get
to more resorts?
Not just Vegas, but the rest
of America, somewhere else.
They're calling us already.
From all over the world,
they're starting to call us.
They love
this tapping system.
Wait, hold on.
Let?? Let's be clear
'cause this is a critical point
in this entire discussion.
The resorts are calling you for
the fully completed coconut...
Yes.
...or they're calling you
for the taps?
Yes.
Okay, I'm lost.
So, hang on.
Did you create the tap
to help the coconut business,
or do you see that as ??
To me, it's almost
two separate businesses.
So, that is ??
The tap business ??
The reason why it's only 20%
of our ?? of our sales
is because we just let that
organically live
on Amazon right now.
But, Coco Lori,
with your help...
[ Laughs ]
...we would do an infomercial,
rock the world on it...
Ah!
Corcoran: Oh, that's
what you had in mind.
...show them how to tap
a coconut in another business.
?Okay.
It's a coco cleanse.
It's where we send them
the coconuts and everything.
Coco cleanse?
You're gonna drop?ship
the coconut?
Three?day coco cleanse.
It works. I've done it.
There's lots of business
here.
Now, with your help, Coco B,
you've done some
amazing franchises.
Franchises?
The Coco ?? The Coco Taps Shack
model will work.
?You have another business?
?Oh, this is another business.
There's three phases
to this entire coco dream
that we're building.
Phase one ??
ultimate vacation beverage.
Look, Vinny, we can't
get straight answers.
?Wow.
?I can't tell if you can scale.
I'm sorry that you feel
that way.
I'm out.
Coco love.
Vinny, there's a term ??
you're drowning
in opportunity.
Every time I took a sip of my
coconut, it was a new business.
I can't follow
the bouncing coconut.
I'm out.
Wow. Okay.
Well, coco love.
Corcoran: I think this
is a complicated business
with a really skinny margin.
Although, I think this
is a cute, little product
that could sell a lot.
But the truth of the matter is
it's way, way too early,
and I don't believe
in that product.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Greiner: Here's my thought ??
I understand the love of
the coconut and all of that.
The problem is it's so niche.
If I invested in this,
I'd be coco?nuts.
Okay.
I'm out.
I'm sorry you don't get it.
I think that you have actually
a fantastic?tasting product
because the coconut water
in this thing is terrific.
You have a wealth
of opportunities,
but what you have to do
is focus.
During the pitch, I didn't
get the clarity of focus,
and I didn't get the clarity
of the game plan operationally,
and unfortunately ??
Do I hear ?? Time out.
Do you want to
just hear the ??
I'm out, brother.
Coco love to you.
Thank you, guys.
Congratulations
on what you've accomplished.
?Coco love, Coco Vinny.
?Thank you. You know what?
?Good luck.
?I'm on my way out.
[ Laughter ]
? Life can be a tough nut
to crack ?
? Coco Taps
will get you right on track ?
?Bye, Coco Rey?Rey.
?See ya, Coco Rey?Rey.
? Great taste,
less waste, too ?
? Coconut water
from a Mexican Jew ?
[ Laughter ]
? And it's gotta be fresh,
right from the tree ?
? Freshly fresh
is the best way to be ?
? No mess,
and no stress, too ?
? Gotta tap your thirst,
coco dreams come true ?
Narrator:
Next into the tank is a way to
take control of your healthcare.
in house?made almond
or coconut milk.
Resulting product
has a beautiful consistency
of a pudding,
is just as easy to digest
as traditional oatmeal,
but it's
more nutrient?dense.
We haven't cooked off all those
awesome vitamins and minerals.
Mush is also dairy?free,
protein?rich, high in fiber,
and it's served
conveniently cold
in these amazing six?ounce
single?serving pods
for grab?and?go
convenience.
They even come with a little
white spoon underneath the lid.
Da?da?da?da!
[ Laughs ]
So all you have to do
is pop the top,
peel off the seal,
and enjoy.
Now, Mush is so much more than
a healthy, convenient oatmeal.
It's honestly
fuel for your body
and fuel for a revolution
in the food industry.
Sharks, we don't know
how else to cut it to you.
We're [bleep] fed up
with the food industry.
So, please, for the health
and well?being of this country,
join us in combating America's
love affair with sugar.
Now, who's ready to Mush it
to the limit?
?I'm ready.
?Let's try it!
?I'll try some Mush!
?Yeah!
?I'd like some mush!
?Is it "moosh," or is it "mush"?
?It's either way.
?Oh, the whole thing is for me.
