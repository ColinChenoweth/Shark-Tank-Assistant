My name's Brendan Alper,
and I'm from Brooklyn, New York.
I'm seeking $200,000 for a
5% stake in my company Hater ??
the only company
in the world
that can make love
using the power of hate.
[ Chuckles ]
Now, Sharks, I know most
of you aren't single anymore,
but let's take a ride
in my time machine, shall we?
[ Laughs ]
?Stud!
?Mark, what is that?!
?What a stud. What a stud.
?Look at the mullet.
?That is so good?looking.
?He's so pretty.
Oza: That jaw line ??
so powerful, Mark.
Mark, picture this.
It's the year 1990,
and you're on a...
mediocre first date.
It's going okay.
You're talking.
You both like your jobs.
You both like sports.
Boring.
But then
you start talking about
how much you hate
basketball referees.
How would you feel
about that?
I never had a bad date,
but I get your point.
?[ Laughs ]
?Ha?ha.
Ooh!
When it comes to dating,
hating always gets overlooked.
But there are
studies that show
that people who hate
the same things
actually form closer bonds
than people
who love the same things.
Very interesting point.
Yeah.
And that's why
I invented Hater ??
the dating app that matches you
based on what you hate.
?[ Chuckles ]
?That's great.
?That's very clever.
?Oh, my gosh.
?Want to see how it works?
?Yes, sir.
Okay. Now, Rohan, you're
today's lucky bachelor, okay?
Okay!
We're gonna try
to find you love through hate.
But the other Sharks
get to play along, too.
Here you go.
?Okay.
?One for each.
?Thank you.
?Ah!
?I love a game. Nice.
?This is great!
?There you go.
Thank you!
Greiner: So we're gonna play
"Hate this or like this," right?
?This is fun.
?Here's how it works.
I'm gonna show you topics
on the screen,
and you have to say whether
you love or hate them.
And the we can find
your perfect match, okay?
?Okay, good.
?All right, so,
staying in on a Friday night.
I'm okay.
I'm okay with that.
People who only eat organic.
Wow.
[ Laughter ]
All right, selfies.
?Selfies.
Mr. Wonderful.
[ All groan ]
No question.
No question.
He's not here to defend himself.
That's not fair.
All right, now we're gonna find
your perfect match.
Ready?
[ Laughter ]
Ohh, Barbara!
All right!
?Bingo!
?Let's do this.
Right under your nose
the whole time.
Uh?oh, uh?oh! Whoop!
[ Laughter ]
I've always wanted
a short rich man.
[ Laughs ]
See how well it works?
So, here we have Barbara,
and we can see all
of the things that she hates.
So everything that she swiped
on, you get to see,
and everything you've swiped on,
she gets to see.
That's pretty cool.
That's great insight
going into a date.
?Cool.
?It's really interesting.
So, you download the app,
and then you start throwing
questions at me
like you threw to us.
?Exactly. Hop right into it.
And I swipe left
or swipe right, or...?
That's right.
There's five different options.
You can hate, love,
dislike, like, or neutral.
The key to this is acquisition,
right?
So, how many people
are on this app?
So, we launched around
Valentine's Day of this year,
and we already have
over half a million people.
And what's your biggest
concentration in any one city?
It's New York and Oslo
are actually tied.
Together: Oslo?
So, how are you
making money?
The app is free right now,
and it's early.
Mm?hmm.
We started ??
But how do you plan
to make money?
So, we ?? we're testing out
a few different ways,
but the most interesting part
is actually the data here.
So, let's say you wanted to
advertise one of your products.
We could slide it in
as a topic,
and not only can we tell you
who loves your product,
what demographics hate it,
we can also tell you,
"People who love your product
also love these flavors
or hate these celebrities."
?But you have no sales today.
?Zero sales.
?No sales?
?Zero sales.
That's correct.
But you have
a $4 million valuation.
?Yes.
?Got it.
Typical app.
So you say ??
How did you come up with this,
Brandon?
I got to know.
Right out of college,
I?I needed some money,
so I went to go work
on Wall Street.
I stuck it out for six years,
and I hated it.
And I finally worked up
the courage to quit
and become a comedy writer.
And Hater was originally
a comedy?sketch idea that I had.
But the more I thought about it,
the more I thought,
"I actually think
there's a demand for this.
I think people would use this
if we could make a product
that was as good as the idea."
And so that was
about two years ago.
I set off on the journey,
and here I am today.
Wow.
But how do you support yourself
doing this new business?
So, up until this point,
I have not paid myself a salary.
I liquidated my 401(k).
I cashed all my life savings
from Wall Street.
?Wow.
?You're all?in, aren't you?
I'm all?in.
How much have you raised
in total?
We raised 500k.
We just closed
on the investment.
What?!
?Yeah.
?Wow.
From a very exciting investor,
as well.
It's the founders of King,
the mobile gaming company.
How much equity
do they get for that?
They get 12.5%.
So, it was $3.5 million
free money,
and then after the money,
we're now at $4 million.
?How did they find you?
?So, I knew that the only way
that we were gonna
get market saturation
if we made a big splash
right away.
So one of the first guys
that I hired was a PR guy.
And for months, we just worked
on crafting this story,
making the pitch,
and sending it
to as many reporters
as we could.
And within a few days, we had
hundreds of thousands of people.
?Wow.
?What's your daily active users?
Daily active users ??
closer to 8,000 to 10,000.
Okay, so that's
why you're here 'cause that's ??
that's not
anywhere near enough
for people
to really get dates from it.
Exactly.
What makes these things
successful
is density
in the marketplace.
So tell me about
how many people in New York
and what the engagement and
ongoing consumer interaction is.
In New York,
that's our number?one city.
We have
tens of thousands of users.
In terms of daily active,
I think we have
a few thousand every day.
So, as the only one
on this panel
who's actually not married,
you know,
I may use these apps,
and my biggest need
would be options.
Sure.
And I think that
from your numbers,
what I'm lacking is
the sheer density of people.
Yeah.
So from my experiences,
maybe just take that money and
really drive hard in two cities.
Right.
Because, you know,
there's enough population
in New York City alone.
Right.
Then there's
a whole buzz around it.
When you start spreading
yourself too thin,
then there's just
not enough in each market.
From my level of expertise,
I?I prefer a more dense
user base in a particular city
'cause then I can see
what the interactions are,
and then
I'd be jumping in.
As much as I love you,
I'm out.
Okay.
The name is pure genius
'cause it's contrary.
And your upside?down heart
I love, okay?
I believe
it's a constant press hook.
And you happen to live
in New York City ??
the press capital
of the world.
How convenient.
So I'm gonna offer you
$250,000 for 5%.
More than you're asking.
?Ooh.
?And I want you to answer me now
because
I'm clearly being a jerk
offering you
more than you're asking for.
Wow.
Is that a take?it?or?leave?it
exploding offer?
You're saying I don't get to
hear from anyone else?
?Yes, that's what she's saying.
?It goes away if he says no.
?Boom!
?If anyone wants to jump in
right now,
now would be the time.
Dude,
that's a great offer.
?[ Laughs ]
?Now would be the time.
?She gave you more money!
?Wow, listen.
I would take it
in a heartbeat and run.
I?I also like Hater.
Though, I'm sorry,
I got to come in and ??
and be a hater
and disrupt this.
But I really like it, but I like
it for a much bigger reason.
I think
that we could take the app far,
but I also see Hater
as could become a brand.
?Yeah.
?Like a big brand.
I could see Hater products.
?Haterade, maybe?
?I could see Haterade.
?[ Laughs ]
Haterade!
Now we're struck.
We don't like beverages.
Too expensive.
It get ?? It gets my mind going
because this is what excites me.
This is what I do.
Is this an offer, Lori,
or is this a chitchat?
So I'm gonna make you
an offer.
My offer is going to be
the $200,000 for 10%.
I'm off the table!
Really?
You're taking it off the table?
Together: Five, four, three...
?Oh, my God!
?You're gonna lose her!
?...two...
?You're gonna lose her!
?Barbara, wait!
?...one!
Narrator: One Shark is out.
Brendan has two offers
on the table
from Lori and Barbara
for his dating app Hater.
But Barbara may pull her offer
if Brendan doesn't
decide immediately.
She's gonna ??
You're gonna lose her!
Wow!
?...two...
?You're gonna lose her!
?Barbara, wait!
?...one!
Nope! Off the table!
So, you know,
I'm not going to be
somebody who hands you off
to an assistant of mine.
I'm gonna be somebody
who actually sits with you,
brainstorms, works,
figures it out together.
You're gonna get me.
You're gonna get my time.
You're gonna get
that personal Shark
holding your hand
all along the way.
That is so exciting.
Now let's talk business.
?Ay, ay, ay.
You either have to get big
or go home. Right?
?I'm unhappy.
?Because none of your brands ??
I'm with Barbara.
None of your brands
are gonna give you any money...
?Ay, ay, ay.
?...unless you have
a big enough user base.
Would you agree with that?
?I would agree with that.
?Okay.
So, in order
to get to those places,
you have to have visible
celebrity influencer?type people
that use the app.
And then on top of that,
I love the gaming aspect.
That's why King came in to you,
right?
Because that's
something different.
They're looking for new
platforms that can accelerate.
That's why they invested,
correct?
Mm?hmm. Exactly.
?Is there an offer?
?So we're on the s??
So we're all on the same page
so far, right?
?We're on the same page.
?Are you giving an offer?
Oza: Is there an offer
in this thing?
Is there an offer here?
So, what ?? Let me tell you
what I can do before I ??
So there's a ??
There's a lesson.
A lesson.
Go, Mark.
No, so, what I can do is
obviously celebrities, right,
whether they play for the Mavs,
throughout the NBA,
actors, whatever.
I'll give you the $200,000,
but I want 7.5%, plus I want
2.5% in advisory shares.
That's easy.
?So he's sort of matching me.
?So ?? So similar deal.
?Same deal.
?But he really sold the farm.
Same deal as Lori.
And you're gonna save money
in going out
and getting the influencers.
And he'd like to have me
in on the deal with him.
No.
Brendan, what's your answer
to Mark's offer?
I ?? My answer is I would like
to hear from Robert.
Okay, so you're not sold
on my offer?
Oza: Ooh!
By the time you're done
with him, I may not be here.
Make it exploding.
Brendan, love it.
Hate the idea
of making it wider right now.
It's all about density.
Mark's long preamble is right.
You got to get out there.
Kids are gonna love to play it.
I have to tell you
the PR angle from this is huge.
But I think you're gonna need
a little more money.
I think you either ??
you have to run faster,
do events
in a couple of cities.
I'd start
with New York and LA.
And I actually think
the person that would be really
good with you on this
is Barbara.
I love working with her.
Here's my offer.
I'll also give you $250,000,
with Barbara,
if she'll come along, for 15%.
So $500,000 for 15%.
$250,000 from Barbara,
$250,000 from me.
Let's blow this thing up.
I would go in for the $500,000
with Robert for the 15%.
I'm torn because I want to work
with all of you.
?We can ??
?Brendan, the thing I'll add ??
You'd have to spend money
for the influencers.
You'd have to spend money
for the parties
with the celebrities.
That's gonna be a cost,
even with King involved.
That won't be a cost
with me involved.
And that's the difference.
So, what are you gonna do,
Brendan?
[ Sighs ]
The one thing I've learned
with founders,
and the biggest mistake
they make
is not taking
enough money in.
I'll leave you
with that.
That is true.
[ Sighs ]
Take the money.
[ Sighs ]
I think I have to go
with my gut here.
Thanks, Brendan.
This is right up my alley.
Alper: Going in,
I really wanted Mark.
I just know he has experience
in the technology space,
and he has the connections
that can really
take Hater to the next level.
