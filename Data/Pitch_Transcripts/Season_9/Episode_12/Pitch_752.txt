My name is Coco Vinny.
I'm from Long Beach,
California,
Come on, Coco Rey?Rey.
Aloha.
Whoo!
Now, Coco Ro, here you go.
Lovely.
Thank you, buddy.
?Thank you so much.
?Coco Lo?Lo!
?This is Coco B.
?Here. Cheers.
?Thank you, darling.
?Salut.
?Coco Ro.
?Coco Ro.
?Wow.
?Oh! Wow!
Now, Sharks,
drinking coconut water
You know, we've all seen some
crazy ways to open a coconut.
is the only 100% made in USA
coconut water system.
You take the Coco Tapper,
you remove the safety cover,
Now, once a hole
is in the coconut,
Now, the end of the Coco Tapper
is like a wrench.
Now, once the tap is secured
into the coconut,
it's fully re?sealable.
Our lab results show
that the fresh?tapped coconut
will last up to four weeks
in the refrigerator.
Now, Sharks, our mission
is to get everyone tapped in to
this ultimate vacation beverage.
All you got to do is say,
"Yes!"
So you're selling
a self?contained coconut drink.
How often do you have to go
around the Las Vegas strip
delivering to the 20 resorts?
So, we're delivering daily.
So, we have, you know,
major corporations ??
Caesars, MGM Mirage,
Cosmopolitan, Wynn, Encore.
How much do you charge
for them, Coco Vinny?
So I made the coconut
re?sealable,
created the tool kit.
Vinny, that's not the challenge,
right?
The challenge is you're
a delivery service, right?
You've got to deal
with the logistics of delivery.
How do you scale that?
We invented a whole high?volume
production system
Vinny, I'm not worried about
the production issue.
Greiner: Producing it ??
When you say ??
How do you get
to more resorts?
Not just Vegas, but the rest
of America, somewhere else.
They're calling us already.
From all over the world,
they're starting to call us.
They love
this tapping system.
Wait, hold on.
Let?? Let's be clear
'cause this is a critical point
in this entire discussion.
The resorts are calling you for
the fully completed coconut...
Yes.
...or they're calling you
for the taps?
Yes.
Okay, I'm lost.
So, hang on.
Did you create the tap
to help the coconut business,
or do you see that as ??
To me, it's almost
two separate businesses.
So, that is ??
The tap business ??
The reason why it's only 20%
of our ?? of our sales
is because we just let that
organically live
on Amazon right now.
But, Coco Lori,
with your help...
[ Laughs ]
...we would do an infomercial,
rock the world on it...
Ah!
Corcoran: Oh, that's
what you had in mind.
...show them how to tap
a coconut in another business.
?Okay.
It's a coco cleanse.
You're gonna drop?ship
the coconut?
Three?day coco cleanse.
It works. I've done it.
There's lots of business
here.
Now, with your help, Coco B,
you've done some
amazing franchises.
Franchises?
The Coco ?? The Coco Taps Shack
model will work.
?You have another business?
?Oh, this is another business.
There's three phases
to this entire coco dream
that we're building.
Phase one ??
ultimate vacation beverage.
Look, Vinny, we can't
get straight answers.
?Wow.
?I can't tell if you can scale.
I'm sorry that you feel
that way.
I'm out.
Coco love.
Vinny, there's a term ??
you're drowning
in opportunity.
Every time I took a sip of my
coconut, it was a new business.
I can't follow
the bouncing coconut.
I'm out.
Wow. Okay.
Well, coco love.
Corcoran: I think this
is a complicated business
with a really skinny margin.
Although, I think this
is a cute, little product
that could sell a lot.
But the truth of the matter is
it's way, way too early,
If I invested in this,
I'd be coco?nuts.
Okay.
I'm out.
I'm sorry you don't get it.
I think that you have actually
a fantastic?tasting product
because the coconut water
in this thing is terrific.
You have a wealth
of opportunities,
but what you have to do
is focus.
During the pitch, I didn't
get the clarity of focus,
Coco love to you.
Thank you, guys.
Congratulations
on what you've accomplished.
?Coco love, Coco Vinny.
?Thank you. You know what?
?Good luck.
?I'm on my way out.
