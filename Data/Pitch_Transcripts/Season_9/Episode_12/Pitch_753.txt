?Thank you, Julia.
?Thank you.
Walk us through
an average test.
Let's ?? Let's look at
Rohan's test.
Does he send a blood sample?
What does he send?
Okay, do I pee?
What do I do here?
With the Vitamin D test, it is a
small finger?prick blood sample.
About half of our tests
require a small finger prick.
Half of them don't.
How do I get the test?
I go to your website.
So, currently,
we have 13 different tests,
all available
only on our website today.
How much do they cost?
They range from anywhere
from $69 to $399.
How much cheaper is that
than going to the doctor?
It's generally cheaper
to use our tests.
For example ??
?By 10%, 50%?
It very much depends
on your insurance.
So, Julia,
it's not covered by insurance.
Today we entered the market
to get traction
by being cash?pay?only.
We are not in network
with insurance providers yet.
So what you're really selling to
me ?? It's really convenience.
I can get the test done quickly.
I don't have to go anywhere.
Our customers tell us
the value proposition is access,
not just convenience.
The reason
we started the product
is 'cause people cannot actually
get these tests on their own.
They also aren't able to know
the price of the test
before they go to the lab
to the get blood taken
or provide a saliva sample.
They get hit with a lab bill.
Have you proven this out?
Do you have revenue?
Do you have consumers?
We launched
in beta last summer.
In less than a year, we have
sold $2.5 million of product.
You're not a doctor, Julia,
right?
I'm not a doctor.
You must have raised
a lot of money.
I raised $5 million to date.
?Wow.
?At what valuation?
The last round
was the convertible note
at a $15 million cap.
What's your burn rate today,
Julia?
Our burn rate right now
is about $150,000 a month.
You're losing money today
on this.
We are losing money,
but it's 'cause
we're investing
for building
additional features.
or from genomics companies.
Julia, your challenge
is competition.
It is a race right now. It's
gonna take a lot more money.
There's gonna be a ton
of competition in this space.
So I'm gonna be
a little creative here.
Cheek: Okay.
How about I give you
a $1 million line of credit,
8% interest for the 5%.
?Well done, Julia.
?It's so exciting!
?Wow!
?Thank you so much. I love it.
It'll be great
to work with you.
I love it.
?[ Laughs ]
?That's so smart.
?Congratulations, Julia.
?Thank you all very much.
?You were fantastic. Congrats.
?I really appreciate it.
Thank you.
Yay! I'm so excited!
