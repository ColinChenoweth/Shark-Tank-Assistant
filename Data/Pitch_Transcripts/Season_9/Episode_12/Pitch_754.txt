My name is Julia Cheek,
and I'm from Austin, Texas.
My company is EverlyWell,
and I'm seeking $1 million
in exchange for 5% equity.
?Whoo!
?Good for you!
EverlyWell is transforming
lab testing,
a $25 billion market,
to be simple, convenient,
and useful for you.
I started EverlyWell because
I had a really common problem.
I spent months
trying to figure out
a very basic hormone imbalance.
I went to a lot of doctors
who ran a lot of tests,
which took a lot of time
and cost me a lot of money
in unexpected lab bills.
All I received was a bunch
of this paper with numbers,
which I spent weeks researching
on my own with no help.
I thought there had to be
a better way.
And that's why we built
EverlyWell.
EverlyWell provides convenient
at?home lab tests
with results you can actually
understand and use.
The process is simple.
Purchase a kit on our website,
where we have everything
from food intolerance
to metabolism testing.
Collect your sample
at your convenience at home,
and send it back
to one of our certified
and accurate partner labs.
Board?certified physicians
review and approve your results,
and in just a few days, you get
your results in your inbox
and online
on our secure platform.
You'll find easy?to?read graphs,
custom content,
and a community of support.
No more wasting time
in waiting rooms.
No more guessing
how much your test will cost.
And no more wondering
about your results.
So, Sharks, who wants to test
the waters with EverlyWell?

?Let's do ??
I'd like to test
my cholesterol right now.
Can you do it right ??
Not in real time.
?No, it requires a lab, yeah.
?Here you go. Vitamin D.
Vitamin D,
and I'm deficient in that.
Food sensitivity, Lori.
You like to cook.
?Thank you.
Men's health for Mark.
Cholesterol
'cause you like to run, Barbara.
?Mine's nice and low.
?Good heart health.
?I know that.
?Sleep and stress
for adrenaline
from racing cars.
?Thank you, Julia.
?Thank you.
Walk us through
an average test.
Let's ?? Let's look at
Rohan's test.
Does he send a blood sample?
What does he send?
Okay, do I pee?
What do I do here?
With the Vitamin D test, it is a
small finger?prick blood sample.
About half of our tests
require a small finger prick.
Half of them don't.
How do I get the test?
I go to your website.
So, currently,
we have 13 different tests,
all available
only on our website today.
How much do they cost?
They range from anywhere
from $69 to $399.
How much cheaper is that
than going to the doctor?
It's generally cheaper
to use our tests.
For example ??
?By 10%, 50%?
It very much depends
on your insurance.
So, Julia,
it's not covered by insurance.
Today we entered the market
to get traction
by being cash?pay?only.
We are not in network
with insurance providers yet.
So what you're really selling to
me ?? It's really convenience.
I can get the test done quickly.
I don't have to go anywhere.
Our customers tell us
the value proposition is access,
not just convenience.
The reason
we started the product
is 'cause people cannot actually
get these tests on their own.
They also aren't able to know
the price of the test
before they go to the lab
to the get blood taken
or provide a saliva sample.
They get hit with a lab bill.
Have you proven this out?
Do you have revenue?
Do you have consumers?
We launched
in beta last summer.
In less than a year, we have
sold $2.5 million of product.
Wow.
And we're on
a $400,000?a?month run rate.
We've grown 20% on average
month over month.
?Good for you.
?That's very good.
And you're projected
to do what?
So, the forecast today
is $5 million, $5.5 million
based on our online business
without the genomics launch
next month, which is happening.
Sales this year
are $5 million.
Yes.
Next year?
$12.3 million.
So we do expect next year
to be able to double through
the genomics combined products.
Tell us something about
yourself.
We don't know
your background.
Actually, I come from
a fairly traditional background.
I grew up in Dallas.
Got, actually, a full academic
scholarship to Vanderbilt.
?Wow.
?Graduated early
with a double major in econ
and psychology.
Ended up in consulting
and actually went back
to get my MBA from Harvard,
where I graduated top 5% there,
as well.
?That makes sense.
?Wow.
You're not a doctor, Julia,
right?
I'm not a doctor.
You must have raised
a lot of money.
I raised $5 million to date.
?Wow.
?At what valuation?
The last round
was the convertible note
at a $15 million cap.
What's your burn rate today,
Julia?
Our burn rate right now
is about $150,000 a month.
You're losing money today
on this.
We are losing money,
but it's 'cause
we're investing
for building
additional features.
If we were to cut down
the head count and say, "Okay,
are we just gonna grow
organically?"
we could do that
with our margins today.
It's just not
where we want to go.
Now, we do have one test
that we just launched,
which is already 10% of our
business, which is our STD test.
?I was gonna ask you that.
?You're missing STD
in a big way there.
?I'm like...
That, honestly, will end up
being your number?one seller.
Is there online competitors
like you?
There is no online competitor
doing a platform
of at?home kits.
What about a company
like 23andMe?
Could they just not pivot?
What's the competitive
advantage?
We believe our competitive
advantage is the platform.
Of our six labs, we can actually
roll out 250 different tests,
and next month, we are launching
a partnership with Helix
to actually bring in
genomics products.
So you can get
any type of health data,
whether it's genetic,
whether it's lab,
and add it into the system.
So there are people that'll give
you certain specific tests,
but you're doing
the entire range of them.
Exactly. Right.
Are you looking to sell
to something like 23andMe?
And what's your goal?
?So, yeah, so, our ??
our customers are 75% women,
and ?? and really,
women are going to be ??
They're 80% of the
healthcare decision makers.
?75% are women?
?It was higher.
It was 85% before
we launched our STD product.
Because women
are managing everything.
They're the ones
that need to save the time.
And to the exit question,
this is a really hot space.
There is a lot of opportunity
both for acquisition
from either traditional
diagnostics companies
or from genomics companies.
Julia, your challenge
is competition.
It is a race right now. It's
gonna take a lot more money.
There's gonna be a ton
of competition in this space.
And for those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay.
I think what scares me
about your business
is I think it's gonna take
constant re?development,
and you're gonna need
a lot of money
that I'm not wiling
to give.
So I'm out.
The cost of doing business
in America
for employees on healthcare
is astounding.
Mm?hmm.
When I compare it to my UK costs
or my Canadian costs...
Mm?hmm.
...it's unbelievable.
Four, five times as much
on a per?employee basis.
As Mark said, it's a race.
And you got to raise more money.
It's not for me.
I'm out.
Okay.
I've seen a number
of presentations.
I have to say yours
is probably right there
at the top
in terms of poise...
Thank you.
...intellect,
sophistication.
I also think that taking charge
of your personal health...
Mm?hmm.
...is a massive trend because
we want to know what's going on,
but you don't want to go
to the hospital.
Right.
But this is
a highly expensive game.
I think the $1 million that ??
that I'm happy to give you
would be diluted rapidly
because this is gonna take
tens of millions
to get
to the promised land.
So for that reason,
unfortunately, I'm out.
I think the product
is brilliantly crafted.
?Thank you.
?It's really nice.
It's really easy.
It's super?clear.
I think the state of healthcare
in our country right now
is so precarious.
Millions right now
are out of insurance...
Yes.
...or fearing
that they will be.
And I think that this gives
people an empowered way
at least to check
on some things
to know whether or not
they have to go find a doctor.
And I totally get
the woman thing.
I would like to take
a flier on you.
So I'm gonna be
a little creative here.
Cheek: Okay.
How about I give you
a $1 million line of credit,
8% interest for the 5%.
And then I'll bring
all the marketing savvy
and the retail and everything
that I know I can do.
We actually desperately
need a line of credit.
?Oh!
?As you know,
our inventory
isn't very expensive,
and we don't have enough history
to have collateral from a bank.
And so while I didn't bring that
up today,
it was something that
I'm very interested in.
?So I read your mind.
?You did.
Well, then...?
So, I know that I'm technically
supposed to counter.
But I...
?You're allowed to say yes.
But I would love to do a deal
with you, Lori...
?Whoo!
?...if you want to do it.
?Whoa!
?Thank you!
?Outstanding!
?Yay!
?Well done, Julia.
?It's so exciting!
?Wow!
?Thank you so much. I love it.
It'll be great
to work with you.
I love it.
?[ Laughs ]
?That's so smart.
?Congratulations, Julia.
?Thank you all very much.
?You were fantastic. Congrats.
?I really appreciate it.
Thank you.
Yay! I'm so excited!
Lori has the knowledge
of how to think about branding.
We have a great team
of investors,
but there's something about
being able to understand
how to sell products to our
consumer base, which is women.
And she's gonna be
so helpful in doing that.
?Let's just take this example.
?This could be huge.
Let's say you're in college.
You're sexually active.
Just for that test alone,
think how many students
and young people and whatever
it would help out.
Just college campuses.
I agree with you.
It's huge.
Unmarried people
it would help out.
Narrator: Next up is a healthier
way to start your morning.
