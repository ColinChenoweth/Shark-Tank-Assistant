Hi, Sharks.
I'm Ashley Thompson.
And I'm Kat Thomas.
We're the creators of Mush
out of San Diego, California.
And we're here on a mission
to combat America's
love affair with sugar.
We're here to offer you a
10% equity stake in our company
in exchange for $300,000.
So, when Ashley and I first
entered the workforce
in the world of finance,
we quickly realized
how genuinely hard it is
to find foods that are healthy
as well as convenient.
As you Sharks know,
most on?the?go breakfast foods
and snacks like yogurt,
protein bars, cereal ??
They're all completely laden
with sugar
and other
processed garbage.
That's why we created
this bad boy ?? Mush.
First to market, all natural,
100% ready?to?eat oatmeal.
Now, the really cool thing
about this product
is it's never
actually cooked.
What we do
is we cold?soak the oats
Thomas: So, we're gonna start
from right to left.
On your right,
you'll see vanilla bean.
That's the original flavor.
What we have there
is a rolled oat
soaked in
our house?made almond milk.
We then add
an organic vanilla bean.
Oh, wow!
Sweeten it with a degla date
out of Coachella, California,
a touch of sea salt,
and that's it.
Exactly.
?All right, dark? They're ??
Dark cacao.
It's an organic cacao powder.
The benefit of that is it's
incredibly high in antioxidants,
considered a Mayan super food.
?It's great.
?Yeah, so, some people ??
?It's delicious.
'Cause there's a bitter ??
a bitter earthiness to it.
?Great. This is fantastic.
?Michigan blueberry.
We use a wild blueberry
out of Michigan.
Has a much more tart,
sweet profile.
And then the last
is a cold brew.
You're actually getting
your caffeine
and your breakfast
all in one.
You've got date
and then a touch of sea salt.
Oza:
Product is fantastic.
You guys have
definitely delivered
on the trend
of where things are going.
Sugar is public enemy
number one.
You have fiber in here.
You have protein in here.
All the good stuff.
Tell us about the sales.
Exactly that.
?Okay, great.
So, we started the company
two years ago.
Our first year we just sold
the product at farmers markets
to get feedback.
We did $70,000 in sales
our first year.
This year
we've done $120,000.
We've launched in Whole Foods
in March.
And the number
for next year?
We're set to make $900,000
for the year.
?Wow!
?All right,
what do you make it for?
What does it retail for?
Sure.
So,
depending on the flavor,
we make it
for about 70 to 80 cents.
What's the retail?
The retail's $3.99.
Your margins are terrific.
But your price point
seems out of whack
with some of the competitors
that I've seen out there.
?Okay.
?I disagree.
I don't ?? I don't think
the price point's too high.
Okay.
I think for the value
you provide,
the convenience you provide,
the challenge
is where you're selling it.
If you're completely dependent
on grocery stores,
then he's right ??
You have to be concerned.
But you have
such a convenience factor
and the fact that Amazon
is taking over the world,
I mean, there's a reason
why Amazon bought Whole Foods.
Jeff Bezos believes that pricing
and speed of delivery
are the two things that will
never go out of style,
and so his goal is that
they can get groceries to you
faster than you can
get in the car
and go to the grocery store
and back.
Where Mark is wrong is that
price point does matter
'cause there's a price point
that's been set ??
When you're in a case ??
When you're in a case
next to your competition.
But even online,
yogurts have set a price point,
whether we like it or not.
They're $1.99.
Can I throw out a random idea?
?Sure.
I think that,
just very tactical,
you might have
too big of baggage.
There might be
too much in here.
I think you can drop
cost of goods...
Thompson: Sure.
...and then it also bridges
the snack realm...
Sure.
...where I'm not
fully making this a meal.
?Yes.
?Tell us about you.
What's your background?
How do you know each other?
So, I got a job at Goldman
in London.
When I looked around
the trading floor
and I looked at the very few
women that there were
and I really
didn't find anyone
that I would aspire to be
one day.
Mm.
And so I was like, "Okay,
this maybe isn't the best fit."
Ashley, tell me about you.
So, I went to school
in New York City,
graduated in three years
with a mathematics
and economics degree,
and then went on
to Goldman.
?Did you like that job?
?Unlike Kat, I loved my job.
All right, how did you come up
with the Mush thing together?
So, we were
just, like, talking,
kind of bouncing ideas
off of one another,
and I was like, "Yeah,
I'm itching to do something,
but we don't really know
what to do."
And the one thing
that we connected on
was how hard it was to fuel
ourselves at the desk.
Hmm.
And so we quit our jobs
and moved to San Diego.
?And got to work.
?And then we got to work.
So, guys, I love the mission.
I love your purpose.
But I hate the food business
because it requires
so much money.
Not for me. I'm out.
?Well, we appreciate that.
?Thank you so much.
Thanks so much.
So, ladies,
I respect my venerable Sharks.
Don't get me wrong.
But none of them have been
part of building $4 billion...
Cuban: But there's one exception
to that, right?
...consumer
food?beverage company.
?Let him talk.
?Well, no, no, no.
?You're mischaracterizing.
?Let him talk.
He'll be
the first to admit.
That's not a fair thing
to say at all.
It's okay.
Let him speak.
No, it's not a fair thing
to say.
No, 'cause
there's a difference
between
being an entrepreneur
and having been
through the grind
and having had your back
against the wall
versus walking in and saying,
"50 Cent, here's $10 million
and equity in a company
that I don't own."
Just so we understand here,
I've never been an entrepreneur.
Mark's right.
What I have done
is found brilliant founders
with amazing products
and turned them into
multi?billion?dollar exits.
You don't need another
entrepreneur.
You need someone
with ideas.
And I disagree with Mark.
Isn't that the same thing?
No, Mark.
I agree with Mark.
Amazon is the way of the future.
But today this is not
gonna fly off on Amazon.
No, that's not what I said,
though.
You've got to get ??
That's not what I said.
You've got to get
Whole Foods...
What I said
was the world has changed.
Let him finish.
Let him finish.
You've got to get Whole Foods
nation?wide.
I have that.
?So do I.
You want to get into
traditional grocery?
I have that.
?So do I.
You want ideas on how
to build brands? I have that.
So do I.
?So do I.
?Mark has all of that,
and he's not got a single food
or beverage company
that has exited
over $100 million.
Marketing, connections.
And I'll give you six
if you want, and rock and roll.
Is there an offer?
For me, the juice
has to be worth the squeeze.
There's got to be enough
equity in this thing,
and you'll need more money,
so what I want to do
is offer you guys ??
instead of $300,000,
I'm gonna offer you $400,000
for 20% of the company.
Ooh!
You guys are brilliant
mathematics people.
You worked at Goldman.
It's simply 5%.
Okay,
we're at the point ??
?We're talking about is 5%...
?Each.
...worth getting a decent exit
or getting a mega exit.
You know, Rohan is genius
with the food industry.
He's done SmartWater
and Vitaminwater and popchips.
He could really blow you up.
So I will step out.
Cuban:
Okay, so, wait, wait, wait.
I'll make you the offer
with $300,000 for 10%,
just what you asked for.
?Wow.
And an unlimited credit line.
Whatever you need.
Wait, don't answer that.
Don't answer it.
Narrator: Two Sharks are out.
Kat and Ashley
have two offers
for their cold oatmeal product,
Mush.
Rohan has offered $400,000
for a 20% stake.
Mark's offer is $300,000
for a 10% stake
plus
an unlimited credit line.
What do you guys say?
Wait, don't answer that.
Whether you have Mark
or Rohan or I,
the entire future
of your business is dependent
on the strength of the people
you choose from the get?go.
You fit my team
of entrepreneurs perfectly.
You're cut out of the same cloth
as my winners.
Here's my offer.
I'll give you the $300,000 cash
for 10% of the business.
I'll give you whatever credit
lines you need
'cause the food space
is expensive.
So, guys,
what are you gonna do?
Cuban:
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Let me just give one more
example.
My company
Alyssa's Healthy Cookies.
Same ?? Same concept,
same approach ?? no sugar.
Very similar to you.
?How big is that market?
?$8 million in sales.
?$8 million.
$4 million in profits.
Chef's Cut is my smallest one ??
$60 million.
No, but the difference is,
right,
how much money do they make?
?Chef's?
They're about 5 million bucks
a year.
?Okay, so, that company ??
?Valuation's over $200 million.
So, how about your biggest ??
popchips?
Valuation
is all that matters.
No, the valuation only matters
if you plan on selling.
They want
to change the world.
Do you plan on selling
this company at some point?
No, we want
to change the world.
Change the world.
All right.
So my partner Doug makes
$4 million in profits a year,
and he's just putting
all this in his pocket.
We've gotten offers.
We've turned them down.
Now, I've pushed Doug
to scale more.
Doug doesn't want to go any
faster than he wants to go.
You guys could have done that
in your sleep.
Can we make this popchips
or Vitaminwater?
Or can we make it
Alyssa's Cookies.
That's the difference.
You know what,
he's exactly right.
He's exactly right.
?You want to make a br??
Because his beef jerky
company ??
You want to make it
a mega brand across America.
That's what changes the world,
if you want to change the world.
Yeah, popchips changed the world
in ways we can't imagine.
[ Laughter ]
?Distribution ??
?This is what I do for a living.
If you want to do enterprise
software, he's your guy.
Rohan, you're gonna have
a heart attack.
Herjavec:
What are you gonna do?
They're all, honestly,
unbelievable offers,
and we're, like, incredibly
humbled as entrepreneurs.
It's, like, honestly
a kid's dream.
Mark, we'd love to.
?Ay, ay, ay!
?Aah!
?Thank you so much.
?Thank you.
?You're so welcome.
?Thank you for everyone.
Thompson:
While all of the offers
from the Sharks were amazing,
we went with Mark because
we want to change the world
for the better, and so does he.
Rohan, you got a little bit
scraped in that one.
What did you learn
out of that?
Honestly, I felt, given my
expertise in this industry,
that...
?You were worth more than Mark.
...my equity should have been
worth more.
I think for where they are
and where they want to go,
I think he had a better vision
for them.
I don't disagree.
