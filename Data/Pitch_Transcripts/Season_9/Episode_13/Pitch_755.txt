Hello, Sharks.
I'm Brian Special.
And I'm
Michael Special.
And we are...
The Special Brothers!
The Special Brothers!
[ Laughter ]
We're seeking $50,00 in exchange
for 20% of our company,
and as you're about
to see...
And hear.
...we have a product
that's even more memorable
than our last name.
And it's the holiday season, so
we're going all in on this one.
It's our big moment, bro,
let's go for it.
You s??
You sure about this?
I'm ready.
Oh, boy.
[ Chuckles ]
[ To tune of "Deck The Halls" ]
? 'Tis the season of the comfy ?
? Fa?la?la?la?la,
la?la?la?la ?
? It's the blanket
that's a sweatshirt ?
? Fa?la?la?la?la,
la?la?la?la ?
[ Laughter ]
? Stay warm and cozy ?
? It's the Comfy ?
? The perfect gift
for anyone on your list ?
? Get one now before ?
? They're all gone ?
? Fa?la?la?la?la,
it's Comfy time ?
Yeah!
Michael:
Nailed it! Whoo!
Cuban:
Nailed it!
Imagine, Sharks, you're just
waking up in the morning
or you're driving home
from work.
It's cold outside.
It's nasty.
All you want is to be warm
and cozy, you know, comfy.
Well, that's exactly what
the Comfy is designed to solve.
Because it's a blanket...
[ Laughter ]
...it's perfect
for lounging around the house
in total luxury.
And because
it's a sweatshirt,
it goes with you and keeps
you warm wherever you are.
Oh, my gosh.
The possibilities
are endless,
and kids ??
they love the Comfy.
Sharks, we probably know
what you're thinking ??
this is
just another version
of one of those
infomercial products.
And, well, maybe.
Hopefully.
It is.
Cha?ching!
Cha?ching!
[ Laughter ]
It's made of a soft microfiber
on the outside
and even more luxurious sherpa
on the inside.
Oh.
The pocket is large enough
to fit a phone
or even a tablet,
and the oversized hood
can double as a pillow.
Imagine having that
on an airplane.
And it's very easy to pull in
your arms and your knees
so you can be
completely covered.
But wait!
There's more!      There's more!
What?!
Boy,
is there ever, Sharks!
Not only is the Comfy
one size fits all,
making it perfect
for manufacturing
and also for men,
women, and children
of all shapes
and all sizes,
but the Comfy, Sharks,
is also ??
wait for it...
reversible.
[ Laughs ]
Giving your comfort
some serious style options.
Corcoran:
Looks cute on you.
Yeah, I like that.
Yeah.
So, which one of you
is ready to get comfy with us
so that we can all
make a lot of money,
and, of course,
sing together.
? Joy to the world,
the Comfy's here ?
[ Laughter ]
[ Cheers and applause ]
O'Leary: Okay.
Michael: And, Sharks,
we have presents.
[ Chatter ]
I bet we're getting
a Comfy.
Cool.
Here you go,
Mark.
Got it.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
And Lori.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Mr. Wonderful.
Even Kevin
gets a Christmas gift?
There we go.
Wow.
Wow.
Presents for all.
Thank you, dear.
You're welcome.
Herjavec:
Thank you.
You're welcome.
My head's too big.
[ Laughs ]
We'd love if you guys would
come up and try it on the couch.
Corcoran:
I'll try it.
Where it's ?? Where it's
meant to be worn.
Yes, absolutely.
Kevin looks like
the Grim Reaper.
Uh?oh.
[ Laughter ]
Ahh...
What a
beautiful picture.
Is that comfy
or what?
It's pretty comfy.
Brian: Yeah!
Yeah! Warm.
Michael:
Oh, yeah. See?
Did anybody...
[ Laughter ]
Herjavec: Barbara,
what are you doing under there?!
You have no idea!
What a disappointment!
[ Laughter ]
Greiner: Kevin,
you look just like ??
You know,
Kevin looks pretty good in that.
Feels very...comfy.
It's the Grim Reaper.
Greiner: It fits you.
It suits you.
It does get kinda warm.
O'Leary: Okay,
I'm really hot now.
Herjavec: So,
have you sold any,
or is this
a brand?new invention?
Brand?new.
Brand?new.
We've been at this
for less than six months.
You ?? Sorry,
you have no sales?
No sales yet,
no sales yet.
We are ready to put in
our first major order ??
So what is
the distribution plan?
To be completely online ??
at this point.
That is ??
That's what we want to ??
What are you gonna sell it for?
How much?
Uh,
$39.99 is retail.
And what's it cost you
to make?
$13 to make.
$17 landed.
$17.
Mm?hmm.
Not a great margin,
but...
It comes in one size,
I presume.
One size.
Michael:
One size fits all.
Very easy for manufacture.
Cuban: And how low
can you get the price?
We can get it as low
right now ?? right around $11.
How many units?
About 100,000.
That's a lot of units.
How did you make it?
How'd you come up with it?
Uh, well,
the story goes...
We're both single dads.
From Phoenix, believe it or not.
We invented this in the heat.
And, uh, unfortunately, I'm ??
I'm going through a divorce.
We have
two beautiful kids.
It's the last thing in the world
that I wanted.
And for those first
six months after that,
I was
absolutely devastated.
And so my brother
took me in,
and, uh, my nephew, his son,
which you see right here.
That's Saxon.
He was, uh, sitting
on the couch one morning.
I got up,
and he was wearing
one of my brother's sweatshirts.
Ah.
And he had ??
was up on the couch.
He had his knees
pulled in.
He had ?? He had his arms
pulled in.
I walked by,
and I'm like,
"Whoa, Saxon,
you look so comfortable.
And cozy and warm."
And he's like,
"Yeah, I am."
Looked at my brother
and said,
"You think
we could make these for adults?"
[ Chuckles ]
"Yeah, why not?"
Right?
And then, laying over
the back of the couch
was a blanket, you know,
fleecy sherpa blanket.
We looked at it
and said,
"Well, why don't we make it
out of that material?
And that's
how it was born.
What was the original...
Let's not mention
the other one.
What was its price
at its heyday, at its peak?
I believe
it was $19.95.
Greiner: It was.
The thing is ??
here's the problem for me.
I love you guys.
You are funny, you are nice,
you are wonderful.
But the big elephant in the room
for me is,
the "other one"
that you mentioned?
It's just like it
except it has a hood.
It's not
just like it.
Lori, what was the other one?
What was the other one?
It's called the Snuggie.
It is absolutely
not the Snuggie.
No, but the thing is,
the Snuggie's still being sold,
and ?? and I actually
do a lot of business
with the people
that created it.
Oh, the Snuggie.
I like products
that are unique.
This is not unique enough.
I'm sorry.
I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you for the feedback.
Do you guys know how much money
the Snuggie made?
It sold 22 million units
its first year.
22 million units?
What?
Michael:
Units in its first year.
It's a product
for everyone.
Corcoran: But could you please
explain to me
what the difference between
your product is and the Snuggie?
Okay, so if you were
on the couch with the Snuggie
and you wanted to get up
to go do something,
you have to take it off
every time.
And you're ??
it's open in the back.
It's like having
a robe on backwards.
We're not knocking
the Snuggie,
but this is
a significant improvement.
Cuban: But that ?? that's
not the issue for me,
right? I think it's great.
I think it's comfy.
I'd like to have one.
But the problem is, even if
you get your cost down, right,
you're gonna be burning through
a lot of cash
in order to figure out what
works and what doesn't work.
And so while
I think it's great,
I think you have a lot of
work to do before you're ready.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
All right. Thank you
for the feedback, Mark.
Thanks for the feedback.
Appreciate that.
So, what is it, you don't have
the cash to go to production?
We do.
No, we're ready.
You do.
We do.
But what you have right now
is still a sample.
Do you have the money
for the inventory?
Yes.
We do.
So what do you need
the $50,000 for today?
For more inventory.
Yeah.
But you haven't sold
the first inventory.
No, we haven't,
but...
Cuban:
They're confident.
We're very confident.
We are ?? We are confident.
I mean, we are on ??
What's missing from the pitch is
the customer acquisition cost.
Selling it at $39.99,
it costs me $17 landed, right?
I have that margin
to play with.
But how do I know
that's not all gonna be eaten up
by customer acquisition costs?
And until I know what that is,
I mean, it's...
I think
we have a product
that is, uh,
a potential viral product.
I mean, we're obviously
gonna take it online.
Everybody says that.
No one's ever come here,
stood there, and said...
"We suck."
..."We suck and we don't have
any chance of being viral."
Corcoran: Tell me a little bit
about your website,
or don't you have one?
We ?? No, we do not
have it yet
because we're about
two months away from launching.
We're ??
We don't even have
a final product yet
to take pictures of
and everything else.
[ Laughs ]
We're ?? We're getting that
early next week.
You have the worst answers
to the questions...
Yeah.
...but it comes across
so nice.
Okay.
Hey, we're living
the entrepreneurial dream.
We're on sacred ground
right here.
Amen!
All right. Robert?
Herjavec: Yeah.
This is your big chance.
Michael: Come on, Robert!
That a flier with us.
Love you guys!
You seem so genuine.
You're not gonna have to do
any of the work.
We will do it.
We'll do the work.
I?I got to be honest with you,
I have never seen a Snuggie.
But $22 million in sales,
units?
I'm all over that.
Sometimes, it's okay
to be number two or three
in a really big market.
Don't do it, Robert.
I'll take a flier.
in Michael and Brian's
sweatshirt blanket,
The Original Comfy.
I'll take a flier.
I'll do the $50,000 for 50%.
[ All groan ]
O'Leary: Ooh!
You know what,
that offer makes me comfy.
[ Laughter ]
That's not a flier ??
that's a fat tire.
Getting a little hot
in here.
It's like your thing...
and it's the only offer.
Ouch.
It's the only offer.
Thank you for the offer.
We really do appreciate that.
Oh, my goodness.
I'd love to hear if Barbara
has something to say.
That's pretty greedy,
Robert.
You know what I really
don't like about Robert?
He said,
"Let's do this deal together.
Let's do this...,"
and I'm like "Okay,"
and then
he makes the offer without me.
Well, screw Robert.
I was just starting,
Barbara.
Yeah, you weren't starting ??
you started and you finished.
Okay.
So I'll of course
underbid him,
even though I don't
want to, just to get rid
of him and get even.
Okay.
$50,000 for 30%.
But you do
all the work.
I'm gonna know
how to market it.
I think you hyper?focus online,
and I can help you there
because I've sold
so much product online.
