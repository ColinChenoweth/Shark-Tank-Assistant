My name's Ryan Kenny,
and this Christmas,
I'm asking for $100,000
in exchange for
20% equity of my company,
The Christmas Tree Hugger.
This little guy right here
is The Christmas Tree Hugger,
and we're here to fix the fake.
Now, what do I mean by that?
Well, every year, millions
of artificial?tree owners
put their trees up
and decorate them,
making them look
as perfect as possible.
But almost every artificial tree
has the same ugly secret
down below.
This fuzzy?looking green eyesore
looks nothing like a real tree.
It takes away from
all that holiday magic.
But with
The Christmas Tree Hugger,
you can go from faking it...
to making it, like that.
And you can even use it
to hide your messy cords.
Just run them
through the Hugger,
under the skirt,
and they're gone.
It's as easy as putting on
an ornament.
We have our classic brown bark.
We have birch bark, too.
All of
our Christmas Tree Huggers
reverse to candy cane...
[ Chuckles ]
...so in seconds,
you can go from classy to crazy
and make your tree more fun,
festive,
and a happy thing
to look at during the holiday.
So in the spirit
of the holiday season,
let's just hug it out and
give artificial Christmas trees
the Christmas miracles
they deserve.
And I'd like to hand out
some samples.
Please.
Yep.
Corcoran: Aww,
a little stocking. How cute.
Thank you,
sir.
Yeah,
you're welcome.
Appreciate it.
Aww, you put
our names on it.
Thank you.
Does it say "Grinch,"
Kevin?
[ Chuckles ]
Herjavec:
Thank you, Ryan.
So, Ryan,
do you also have a real job?
Kenny:
Yes, I have a real job.
I'm in advertising.
I'm an art director,
so I'm a pretty creative guy.
How did you come up
with the idea?
Well, my wife and I bought
our first artificial tree,
and everything
looked pretty good,
but then we kind of noticed that
fuzzy green pole at the bottom.
And we were just
scratching our heads ??
"You know, how come no one's
ever made that look better?
It looks nothing like a tree."
So I made a prototype
for my house,
and my wife loved it
and her friends loved it.
And they asked me to put
some online, and it started
selling a little bit.
And then I just started
having fun with it,
and I was like, "You know what?
I think I'm on to something."
Why would
anybody want this?
Who cares?
Well, people do care,
actually.
Really? Who?
Yes!
Well, if you have great sales,
then you prove him wrong.
Yeah.
So, we've been doing this
for a year and a half,
and so far,
our sales are $50,000.
Wow.
What does it cost you
to make one?
It costs us $1.37 to make it.
Oh that's ?? With packaging
and everything...
With packaging, yeah.
We sell it for $17.95.
Mostly online?
Uh, we're online.
We're actually with QVC,
as well.
How many
did you sell on QVC?
Uh, we went on
for the Christmas July sale,
and at 1:00 in the morning
managed to sell 1,000 of them
in 5 minutes.
Good for you.
That's not ?? That's not
a good slot, either.
But they're never gonna
invite you back.
Did they invite you back?
All due respect to
your product and everything...
Yes, we're ?? we're talking
about going back
closer to the holidays.
How many
did they reorder?
Well, we still have the ones
that are in stock,
so they have ??
they're gonna sell through...
How many
did they bring in?
They brought in 5,000 units.
Did they reorder,
or they're just gonna
air them again?
Well, I think
we're gonna air them again,
but right now, it's QVC customer
top?rated, too,
and it's been getting
five?star reviews.
And was the price
on QVC $17.95, as well,
or was it lower?
They're selling it
for $20.
Oh,
that's even better!
So you made
$20,000 on QVC
in 5 minutes
at 1:00 in the morning.
Yeah, that was all
new to me.
That was my first time
ever doing anything like that.
It was ?? It was really fun.
What else
have you sold,
and what are the plans
for this year?
Last year, we did $12,000.
And was that online?
So, I made a cold call...
To?
...right away, to Kroger...
Uh?huh.
...and my first call
with the lady,
she loved it and she wanted
to put it in the store,
so we put it in Kroger.
And how much
was that order for?
That order was for 130 stores,
and they ordered 1,500 units.
Right out of the gate.
They never reordered?
They sold 40% of the units.
Are they gonna
reorder it again?
They're not
gonna reorder it again.
Why's that
a good story?
[ Laughs ]
Well,
it's a good story
'cause we're learning
from our mistakes, and ??
Why aren't they
gonna reorder, Ryan?
'Cause it doesn't sell!
It didn't sell through
well enough.
Kenny: It didn't sell through
well enough.
It's a grocery store.
It's probably not the perfect
place for a product like this.
But it wasn't wrong for you
to take the order.
But we're gonna
take the deal,
'cause it's an opportunity,
right?
Right.
What will revenues be
this year?
If we sell through
the stuff that we have,
we're looking at $220,000
in sales.
And how much do you think
you'll make on that?
I think we'll probably make
around $110,000.
Herjavec: Ryan,
starting a business
is one of the hardest things
you can do.
I admire you
for that.
But inevitably,
for me to invest,
I have to believe
in the product.
I?I just don't like
the product.
I'm out.
Thank you.
I have to compliment you
on one thing
that we don't hear
very often.
You made
a sales call yourself,
walked into Kroger.
You got yourself
a big order.
Good for you.
It only sold through 40% ??
just keep making
those cold calls.
10 more orders at 40%
adds up to a lot of money.
My QVC order
was from a cold call.
Well, let me ??
I'm just kind of
going out there
and just not taking no
for an answer.
Well, let me tell you,
you surprised me.
What a great example
to set.
That's awesome.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, let me say it gently ??
I'm out.
Thank you
for your time.
I don't think Barbara's
done you any favor at all
giving you encouragement
to go on.
The market has spoken ??
It doesn't care
about this product.
The reason
you're going back on QVC
is 'cause they want to get rid
of their inventory.
The reason Kroger
didn't reorder it ??
nobody bought it.
The market said no...
That's so not true.
That's so not true.
...and so I don't want to
offer you any encouragement.
I want to tell you
to take this behind the barn
and shoot it...
That's ??
...so that it leaves time
for to do something else.
Ignore him.
This product is a dog.
Ignore him.
What do you
have to say to that?
You're the first people
who have ever said that.
Every person I've showed
this to, every person I've
cold ?? I've cold called ??
They're lying to you.
Ryan, Ryan.
They are definitely interested.
Here's the reality ??
You picked up the phone,
you called QVC,
you sold $20,000 worth.
You picked up
the phone...
And he made
hundreds of dollars.
...you walked into Kroger's,
and you sold your product.
That's why you're in the
right spot and he's an idiot.
Rah, rah, rah.
Thank you so much.
Herjavec: Mark,
I hate to agree with Kevin,
but at a certain point,
you got to pivot.
Look, what was your sales price
to Kroger?
$6.
$6 ?? So, you made
$4.77 each, right?
Yeah.
And you sold
how many there?
Over 1,000.
So you made almost $5,000,
right, by walking in the door?
Mark, why are you
encouraging him?
You haven't spent
that much time
in closing a deal
in your entire life.
[ Indistinct shouting ]
Kevin,
somebody spends some time,
develops a product,
takes the initiative,
sells them ??
in this case, $20,000 worth ??
If you sold it
for more ??
Mark, why can't you say
just once this is a dog?!
Ryan,
you know what ??
Kevin, I've never quit anything
in my life.
I'm not a quitter.
Good for you.
And this is not something
I'm willing to quit.
Go crush it, Ryan.
Keep on making money.
I'm gonna keep doing this.
Good luck, Ryan.
Congrats, buddy.
