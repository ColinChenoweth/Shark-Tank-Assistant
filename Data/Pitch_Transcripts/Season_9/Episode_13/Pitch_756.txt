My name's Ryan Kenny,
and this Christmas,
I'm asking for $100,000
in exchange for
20% equity of my company,
The Christmas Tree Hugger.
This little guy right here
is The Christmas Tree Hugger,
Herjavec:
Thank you, Ryan.
So, Ryan,
do you also have a real job?
Kenny:
Yes, I have a real job.
I'm in advertising.
I'm an art director,
so I'm a pretty creative guy.
How did you come up
with the idea?
Why aren't they
gonna reorder, Ryan?
'Cause it doesn't sell!
It didn't sell through
well enough.
Kenny: It didn't sell through
well enough.
It's a grocery store.
It's probably not the perfect
place for a product like this.
But it wasn't wrong for you
to take the order.
But we're gonna
take the deal,
'cause it's an opportunity,
right?
Right.
What will revenues be
this year?
If we sell through
the stuff that we have,
we're looking at $220,000
in sales.
Herjavec: Ryan,
starting a business
is one of the hardest things
you can do.
I admire you
for that.
But inevitably,
for me to invest,
I have to believe
in the product.
I?I just don't like
the product.
I'm out.
Thank you.
I have to compliment you
on one thing
that we don't hear
very often.
You made
a sales call yourself,
walked into Kroger.
You got yourself
a big order.
Good for you.
It only sold through 40% ??
just keep making
those cold calls.
10 more orders at 40%
adds up to a lot of money.
My QVC order
was from a cold call.
Well, let me ??
I'm just kind of
going out there
Ryan, Ryan.
They are definitely interested.
Here's the reality ??
You picked up the phone,
you called QVC,
you sold $20,000 worth.
Ryan,
you know what ??
Kevin, I've never quit anything
in my life.
I'm not a quitter.
Good for you.
Go crush it, Ryan.
Keep on making money.
I'm gonna keep doing this.
Good luck, Ryan.
Congrats, buddy.
