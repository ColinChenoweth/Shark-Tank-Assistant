My name is Logan Riley.
I'm from beautiful
San Francisco, California,
Smell. Yeah.
Riley:
...that old vinyl smell.

Records have always been another
way to just listen to music.
They're an experience.
However,
this experience does come with
Herjavec:
Great invention, Logan.
Looks like a beehive.
I do appreciate that.
Thank you so much.
Oh, I love the case, too.
It's wood.
So, do we have a traditional
phono cartridge in here?
Yes, we do.
But, Logan, if you're into vinyl
and you cherish your records,
why would you
be taking them anywhere
Corcoran: Yeah. Logan,
I'm gonna simplify things
a little bit here.
It's clever ??
my hat off to you ??
but I think
it's way too early.
Even your Kickstarter supporters
haven't tested it out,
never mind
the open market.
So, for those reasons,
I'm out.
I appreciate your time.
Thank you so much.
I don't know that there's
a big enough market for this,
of Logan's
portable vinyl player, RokBlok,
but Logan wants to see
if there are any other offers.
[ Laughter ]
That's okay, Logan ??
a rich employee.
Half a million dollars, Logan.
That's great.
As long as I can continue
focusing on RokBlok
Congratulations, Logan.
Thank you so much.
Congratulations, Logan.
