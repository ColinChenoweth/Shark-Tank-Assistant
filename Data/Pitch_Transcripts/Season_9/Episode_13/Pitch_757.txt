My name is Logan Riley.
I'm from beautiful
San Francisco, California,
and the founder of an
idea company called Pink Donut.
Today, I'm seeking $300,000
in exchange for 15%
of my product, RokBlok.
Smell. Yeah.
Riley:
...that old vinyl smell.
[ Chuckles ]
Records have always been another
way to just listen to music.
They're an experience.
However,
this experience does come with
its own share of inconvenience
and expense.
For example,
to listen to any record,
you have to have a turntable,
a pair of speakers,
and a good pre?amp ?? altogether
costs hundreds of dollars.
And in addition, this experience
can only take place
where all of this equipment is.
You can't really
take it anywhere else.
Well, now you can...
with this.
This is RokBlok,
the world's first
infinitely portable,
wireless record player.
Really?
Greiner: Wow.
Wow.
You can literally
take this guy anywhere.
Let me show you how it works.
Using RokBlok is really
just as simple of turning it on,
placing it on top of any record,
and pulling the lever up
to begin playing.
[ Whirring ]
Herjavec:
Oh, wow.
[ Laughs ]
[ Hip?hop music plays ]
Get out.
Corcoran: Wow.
That is so cool.
To stop playing,
hold your hand above RokBlok
just like this.
[ Music stops ]
Now, if you're like me, you like
your music a little bit louder,
so in addition
to its built?in speaker,
RokBlok also has the ability
to send its music
to any wireless speakers
or headphones...
like that guy over there
using Bluetooth.
[ Whirring ]
[ Hip?hop music plays ]
Wow!
Oh! So cool.
Amazing.
[ Music stops ]
With its tiny size, you can
literally take RokBlok anywhere,
while out on the go
with friends or your next dig.
And with its built?in
rechargeable speaker,
you can literally rock out
for hours at a time
on one single charge.
Whoo!
Can you just play it
on any surface?
Any surface ?? I will always
recommend something go under it,
so here I have a slip mat.
Right.
But any surface ??
I actually have a couple samples
I can hand you guys.
Sure.
Yeah.
Can we see 'em?
Sure.
Any type of vinyl,
like,
Herjavec:
Great invention, Logan.
Looks like a beehive.
I do appreciate that.
Thank you so much.
Oh, I love the case, too.
It's wood.
So, do we have a traditional
phono cartridge in here?
Yes, we do.
And so, because I'm
a bit of a collector,
I've got a lot of albums,
and I care about the quality,
what's the actual quality
on a Bluetooth
I put through
the stereo system?
What does
it sound like?
It sounds great.
Now, the thing is, Bluetooth
is compressing the sound.
Yeah.
So, with that in mind,
there is going some be loss ??
somewhat of a loss in quality,
but to be honest,
most people can't discern
the d??
uh, the difference in quality
between analog or Bluetooth.
That's half the ??
But, Logan, if you're into vinyl
and you cherish your records,
why would you
be taking them anywhere
to play just
in some random place?
In my case, I see not just
a place to take it with you,
I also see it as a way
for people
who don't have room
for all this equipment.
So, for example, I live in
a tiny, 300?square?foot studio.
But yeah, how many of those
people are gonna be audiophiles?
Now you're taking ??
you're shrinking
your potential population
for sales down considerably.
I actually think it's growing,
and the reason why I say that
is not just for audiophiles.
I see this as an entry
into getting into records
in the first place,
so I see ??
Herjavec: So,
you're thinking people
that can't afford
a record player.
Absolutely.
I would have never
gotten into records before.
I just don't know
that there's that many.
What do you sell
one unit for?
They retail at $99.
Oh.
And it costs me $23 to make.
And what are
your sales so far?
So far ?? I started
a Kickstarter in 2016
with $350,000 in total sales.
And besides Kickstarter,
what are your sales?
I have presold an additional
$60,000 worth of RokBloks.
So, you haven't ??
Have you delivered anything yet?
I'm actually in production
as we speak.
But we don't know what the
mass audience is going to think
of the product yet.
We don't have the
feedback 'cause you
haven't delivered yet.
That's true,
but I've spent so much time
making sure
this is a great product,
as an audiophile myself
and somebody who really believes
in making great products ??
Yeah, but people fall in love
with their own products,
particularly inventors.
It has nothing to do with
how the audience receives it
once they have it
in their hands.
Absolutely.
How much money have you raised
for this?
Zero. I put $2,000 of my own
money to build my prototype.
That's it?
Good for you.
With the money from Kickstarter,
I spent that
on the pre?production costs,
which includes the tooling.
And to save money,
I actually lived in China,
slept at my manufacturer's
office for two months.
Wow.
How'd you come up
with this?
So, I started off ??
I'm a ?? I'm a vinyl?head.
I go record shopping
every Saturday.
And one Saturday, my friends
were at a park and said,
"Hey, come meet up with us."
So, I have my vinyl with me.
Everybody's interested
in my vinyls.
And it was like, "Wow.
What'd you get?
What'd you get?"
And everybody's going through
my vinyls.
They're like,
"Let's listen to some."
And I'm like,
"Well, there's really no way
I can let you listen to these."
I mean,
my apartment is about the size
of Mr. Wonderful's tie closet.
[ Laughs ]
I can't fit anybody in
my apartment at 300 square feet.
And so I wanted to find a way
that I could share my records
with my friends or families.
So, I wanted something
that I could take with me,
but usually,
portable record players are big,
'cause they have to be
the size of a record
in order for the record to spin.
So, then, I thought about it ??
rather than the record spinning,
what if I made a unit
that spun around the record?
Then,
it could be any size I want,
and I could take it with me.
So, that's when I first started
on the prototype
that became RokBlok.
What's your background?
How did you know
how to make something like this?
Yeah. You know, actually, this
was my first hardware project.
I taught myself electrical
engineering on YouTube.
So, you're not
an engineer?
So, you didn't hire
an engineer ??
you figured this all out
by yourself?
That's impressive.
Did you file a patent
on this?
I did file a utility patent.
A utility patent.
And that covers the wireless
transmission of audio from
a stationary disc.
You never told us
the rest of your background.
Do you mind
just finishing that?
Yeah, so, my background ??
I do have a background
in audio engineering.
I used to run a recording studio
when I was 19.
Spent five years
working at Apple
with education technologies,
so building ??
teaching, building tools
to teach consumers
how to use the products.
I also did that at
Pandora Internet Radio, as well.
So, I'm investing in you
as an inventor
and everything you invent,
or is it just for RokBlok?
This would just be for RokBlok.
Whoa,
hold on there, Baba Looey.
[ Laughter ]
Baba Looey?
Why would I do that?
[ Chuckling ]
Baba Looey.
Why would I do that?
RokBlok is ?? is ??
is a really ??
So you're just letting me invest
in one single product?
I think each one of my ideas
can be something
completely separate,
and the fun thing is,
if we make a partnership today,
I have more ideas
that I can bring to you.
Corcoran: Yeah. Logan,
I'm gonna simplify things
a little bit here.
It's clever ??
my hat off to you ??
but I think
it's way too early.
Even your Kickstarter supporters
haven't tested it out,
never mind
the open market.
So, for those reasons,
I'm out.
I appreciate your time.
Thank you so much.
I don't know that there's
a big enough market for this,
and I think
you'll get bored
if it doesn't sell
right off the bat
and go on
to your next thing.
I?I think
that's a problem.
Two, I hate working
with perpetual inventors ??
hate it, right?
Because every one's
your baby
until
the next kid's born.
You know?
It's 'cause you go ??
[ Laughter ]
Well?said.
And it's just ??
it just drives me crazy.
It's not about
running the company.
So, for those reasons, I wish
you the best, but I'm out.
I appreciate your time.
Thank you, Mark.
O'Leary: I'm looking at it
with the risk being
that we don't have thousands
of them out on the market,
so we don't know
what consumers are gonna say
and how the product
will stand up ?? all of that.
Having said all that, too,
I?I like it.
I think there's a niche market
in vinyl.
I don't think it's worth
2 million bucks 'cause
it's kind of unproven.
I'll do this deal ??
I'll give you the 300K for 50%.
I want to be ??
5?0?
5?0, yeah.
Half.
And you're
a very impressive guy, okay?
But the risk
is huge,
and it's not
a small amount of money.
I really appreciate that offer.
Thank you so much.
With respect
to this once?in?a?lifetime
opportunity ??
Well, you should,
'cause it's the only one
you have right now.
Absolutely.
With respect, I would like
to just check and see.
I understand what happens
when I ?? when I check and see
if anybody else has an offer,
but with respect ??
Well, let's see if anybody else
has an offer.
of Logan's
portable vinyl player, RokBlok,
but Logan wants to see
if there are any other offers.
With respect, I would like
to just check and see.
I understand what happens
when I ?? when I check and see
if anybody else has an offer,
but with respect ??
Well, let's see if anybody else
has an offer.
[ Chuckles ]
Greiner: I think
this is clever.
I know that the millennials
are into vinyl
and it's, like,
a cool thing again,
but it's expensive
for something
where you have
this niche market,
so, you know,
I?I'm really ??
I'm really on the fence
about this.
Look, I'm not on the fence.
I love it.
I think
it's a beautiful design.
I think it's gonna be
a slow burn.
I don't think it's gonna be
one of these products
that goes to millions
right away,
but I think it'll sell
for a very long time.
I think
you're a great design guy,
but I think you're gonna want
to go do the next thing.
Here's my offer,
and it's a little bit different.
[ Laughter ]
That's okay, Logan ??
a rich employee.
Half a million dollars, Logan.
That's great.
As long as I can continue
focusing on RokBlok
and build other things,
I'm gonna be
a very happy person.
Congratulations, Logan.
Thank you so much.
Congratulations, Logan.
