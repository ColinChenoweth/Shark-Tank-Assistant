Bliss: Yeah, that's the drawing
from the patent.
Wow.
That's dedication.
You're all in.
You can literally rock out
for hours at a time.
Cha?ching!            Cha?ching!
[ Laughter ]
Why would anybody want this?
Who cares?
Le?Let's take a step back
for a second.
We've been at this
for less than six months.
Sorry,
you have no sales?
No sales yet,
no sales yet.
[ All groan ]
I've never quit anything
in my life.
My Christmas gift to you
is the truth.
Does he look like
Mr. Christmas?
I'll take a flier.
Don't do it,
Robert.
Just undercut Barbara.
Well, screw Robert.
So I'll of course underbid him,
It's a dog. It doesn't
matter if we give you
encouragement or not.
He's an idiot!
This is a dog!
[ Howls ]
Narrator:
First into the Tank
is a cozy way to stay warm
during the holidays.
It doesn't matter if we give you
encouragement or not...
You're making
good money!
...it's still a dog!
He's an idiot!
Two deals that are ??
that are not ??
[ Howls ]
...yet, for next year,
but they're ?? they're large.
I am out,
but I'm the only Shark
willing to tell you the truth.
One more time ?? Dog.
[ Howls ]
I?It's really a nice product.
The solution ??
Yeah.
The art director in you
has come out, right,
you know, it doesn't matter
the size?
Any type of vinyl ??
This plays 33s ??
Happy holidays, Sharks.
My name is Matt Bliss.
My company,
Modern Christmas Trees,
is based in Denver, Colorado,
Bliss:
That's him.
That's great.
O'Leary:
Is he still with us?
No, he passed away.
Um, part of my motivation
behind this
is he was diagnosed
with Alzheimer's
in, uh...
[Voice breaking] in 2010.
You're all?in,
Matt.
Corcoran: Wow.
Matt, do they always
have to hang from the ceiling?
I noticed that one's
hanging from ??
They do not. So, this one
hangs from the ceiling,
How come
you have no sales?
Tell him, Matt!
You're $800
before shipping.
The ?? The billion?dollar
marketplace,
which is the artificial
Christmas tree market ??
20% of the customers
that make up that market
Matt, look, first of all ??
beautiful product.
The challenge I have is
I don't see it scaling
to be a $10 million,
$20 million,
$50 million business.
For me, that's where
I have to see it going.
I'm out.
Herjavec:
Look, uh...
beautiful design.
Matt, it's too expensive,
period.
Cuban: So, you have
one Shark left, Matt.
Herjavec: Barbara.
There's a lot
I don't like about it.
I don't like the fact
that you have to display it.
I think the $800 price
is an enormous price.
I think
you have a lot of SKUs,
which are
a pain in the neck.
It means
more production cost.
But the minute you started
talking from your heart
For 25%.
Cuban: It's a great offer,
Matt.
I'll do it for 20%.
To 19%, Matt.
Yes or no ??
what do you say?
O'Leary: Matt, here we are
at Christmas.
I don't feel the love.
What do you
want to do, Matt?
Cuban: Matt, I want you to know
she meant it.
O'Leary:
Under the tree this year,
when you open the present
from Mr. Wonderful...
Nice.
...there'll be a lump of coal
in there.
Bliss: Ah.
Congrats, Matt.
Thanks a lot.
Greiner:
Congrats, Matt.
Thank you.
Cuban: Great job.
