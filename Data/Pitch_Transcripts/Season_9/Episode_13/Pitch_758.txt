Bliss: Yeah, that's the drawing
from the patent.
Wow.
That's dedication.
You're all in.
You can literally rock out
for hours at a time.
Cha?ching!            Cha?ching!
[ Laughter ]
Why would anybody want this?
Who cares?
Le?Let's take a step back
for a second.
We've been at this
for less than six months.
Sorry,
you have no sales?
No sales yet,
no sales yet.
[ All groan ]
I've never quit anything
in my life.
My Christmas gift to you
is the truth.
Does he look like
Mr. Christmas?
I'll take a flier.
Don't do it,
Robert.
Just undercut Barbara.
Well, screw Robert.
So I'll of course underbid him,
just to get rid of him
and get even.
Cuban: Ignore him.
It's a dog. It doesn't
matter if we give you
encouragement or not.
He's an idiot!
This is a dog!
[ Howls ]
Narrator:
First into the Tank
is a cozy way to stay warm
during the holidays.
It doesn't matter if we give you
encouragement or not...
You're making
good money!
...it's still a dog!
He's an idiot!
Two deals that are ??
that are not ??
[ Howls ]
...yet, for next year,
but they're ?? they're large.
I am out,
but I'm the only Shark
willing to tell you the truth.
One more time ?? Dog.
[ Howls ]
I?It's really a nice product.
The solution ??
Yeah.
The art director in you
has come out, right,
and it's
a well?designed package.
I like the concept ??
I just see it as a product,
not a company, and so
for those reasons, I'm out.
Thank you.
My Christmas gift to you
is the truth.
you know, it doesn't matter
the size?
Any type of vinyl ??
This plays 33s ??
33s and 45s ??
It doesn't play 78s.
No 78s?!
A little too fast.
There goes
my collection.
[ Laughs ]
Thank you.
Mm?hmm.
Corcoran: Pretty remarkable.
Good for you.
Thank you so much.
Really.
Happy holidays, Sharks.
My name is Matt Bliss.
My company,
Modern Christmas Trees,
is based in Denver, Colorado,
and I'm here today
seeking $100,000
in exchange for 10% equity
in my company.
Modern Christmas Trees
is illuminating the holidays
in a new and memorable way.
Like the sound of a grand piano
can fill any?size room,
so does the light and the magic
associated with
each of these trees.
Look how they seem to just float
in the air.
These trees come
in several different colors,
sizes, and styles,
each of which elicits
a different feeling and emotion.
We have the full tree
that you see here in green,
we have the half tree that fits
flush against the wall,
and up front, we have
the new Table Top Jubilee.
Modern Christmas Trees
is both art and ease.
They're made of concentric,
collapsible rings...
Cuban:
Oh, wow.
Corcoran:
Pretty cool.
...making them easy
to put up...
Wow.
...easy to take down,
and they even store flat
in their own zipper case.
These trees have been
a tradition in my family
for over 50 years,
and with your guys' help,
we can spread
the joy they create
to families all over the world.
You said this has been
a family tradition for 50 years?
So, the tree was inspired
by my grandfather,
who designed a tree
originally made out of cardboard
that was made
of concentric rings.
Herjavec: Wow.
Is that him?
Bliss:
That's him.
That's great.
O'Leary:
Is he still with us?
No, he passed away.
Um, part of my motivation
behind this
is he was diagnosed
with Alzheimer's
in, uh...
[Voice breaking] in 2010.
And that was a tough thing
for our family.
And, um...
I felt very helpless,
and I wanted to do something
for him.
And I figured
the best thing that I could do
would be to create a legacy
for him.
Herjavec: Did he sell it
at all or...
No, he did not.
Is that a Christmas tree
you have tattooed on your arm?
Yeah, that is the ?? that's
the drawing from the patent.
Wow!
That's dedication.
And then, this is the photo
of my grandfather.
You're all?in.
Greiner: Oh!
You're all?in,
Matt.
Corcoran: Wow.
Matt, do they always
have to hang from the ceiling?
I noticed that one's
hanging from ??
They do not. So, this one
hangs from the ceiling,
and it weighs a total
of about 14 pounds.
So, there's just a little
plastic drywall screw.
But the other one
hangs on the side of the wall.
That's correct.
Tell me what you're gonna sell
this year.
So, this year, we're on track
to do $380,800.
So, I ??
That's pretty specific.
How ?? Why ?? How did you get
to that number?
Well, we've had growth
of 70% per year.
How many years?
Since ?? 2014
is when I quit my job.
Okay.
So, I spent 2012 and '13
learning the marketplace,
learning about
who the customer might be.
So, what was the first step
you took to sell it?
Um, there is a trade show called
the Denver Modernism Show.
I made two trees,
and I put the trees up,
and I kind of ran away
and just kind of listened
to what people said.
[ Laughs ]
I wanted an honest opinion
about it.
Smart.
Yeah,
and, so, um, people loved them.
What does it cost
for the big one?
So, the big one,
fully decorated ??
uh, it costs me $232.
Wow.
What do
you sell it for?
$799 it retails for.
Oh.
Wow, that's pricey.
Hello! Yeah.
O'Leary:
Ouch. Ouch.
Herjavec: Wow.
That's a lot.
That's a lot.
Greiner:
It's your crystals.
It comes with
96 crystal ornaments...
So, the big que??
the question becomes ??
...96 glass?ball ornaments,
the LED light,
a zipper case
that the tree collapses into.
I see a material challenge here
in rolling this out.
Most families don't have $799
to spend.
And this obviously is not
designed for most families.
That's correct.
But, you know,
we've had many...
It's cool,
though.
...products like this
in "Shark Tank."
I have one
called "GeekMyTree."
Yep.
And what we learned was,
you can't sell
Christmas ornaments
for large
amounts of money
'cause people only use them
for a few weeks.
Right.
You want to have
a low price point.
I think the challenge
for this product
is it has to be displayed
for people to understand
its potential as a product.
Where are your sales
coming from?
It ?? It ?? It's about 80%
through the website
and 20% through retail.
And so,
you've got a ton of margin.
So, we sent it through companies
like Frontgate...
Corcoran: Ah,
that's a good one.
...Brookstone,
Hammacher Schlemmer.
Yeah.
Well, you should be making
some money.
How much money are you gonna
make off your $388,000?
Uh, about half that.
Half?
Good for you.
O'Leary:
Good for you.
Wow.
O'Leary: It's a good thing
for you.
You know, I look at this
as a very niche product.
It's beautiful.
It's really expensive.
Let ?? Let ?? Let's take a step
back for a second, if we could.
If we were to sell them
at a lower price point,
we could reach
a much larger market.
No, I'm not suggest??
I'm not suggesting
you should change your pricing.
This is a very niche,
expensive, premium, high?end ??
whatever you want
to define it as.
Mm?hmm.
I mean, I'm ?? I'm steeped in
that market through GeekMyTree.
You're in part of the market
that's probably 3%.
No, you're wrong.
Really?
How come
you have no sales?
Tell him, Matt!
You're $800
before shipping.
The ?? The billion?dollar
marketplace,
which is the artificial
Christmas tree market ??
20% of the customers
that make up that market
are $200 artificial
Christmas trees and higher.
Corcoran: Mm.
Matt, look, first of all ??
beautiful product.
The challenge I have is
I don't see it scaling
to be a $10 million,
$20 million,
$50 million business.
For me, that's where
I have to see it going.
I'm out.
Herjavec:
Look, uh...
beautiful design.
Matt, it's too expensive,
period.
Cuban: So, you have
one Shark left, Matt.
Herjavec: Barbara.
There's a lot
I don't like about it.
I don't like the fact
that you have to display it.
I think the $800 price
is an enormous price.
I think
you have a lot of SKUs,
which are
a pain in the neck.
It means
more production cost.
But the minute you started
talking from your heart
about your grandfather and
your love of what you're doing,
you came to life.
I'm gonna offer you $100,000
for 25%,
but on top of that, I really
want the $100,000 paid back ??
5 bucks a tree.
I don't care what the size is.
Do you know, when I looked at
that Frontgate catalog recently,
they must have had 20 trees
in the $800?to?$1,300 mark.
Yes.
And this is so fresh
and different.
Right.
So fresh and different ??
that's your luxury market.
So, that's my deal,
all right?
Are you willing
to pay a royalty?
Just till
I'm paid back.
Makes sense.
For 25%?
For 25%.
Cuban: It's a great offer,
Matt.
I'll do it for 20%.
To 19%, Matt.
Yes or no ??
what do you say?
O'Leary: Matt, here we are
at Christmas.
I don't feel the love.
And remember,
I got you that 5%.
Barbara would have stayed at 25%
had I not come back in.
But you have to
make a decision.
What do you
want to do, Matt?
Cuban: Matt, I want you to know
she meant it.
O'Leary:
Under the tree this year,
when you open the present
from Mr. Wonderful...
Nice.
...there'll be a lump of coal
in there.
Bliss: Ah.
Congrats, Matt.
Thanks a lot.
Greiner:
Congrats, Matt.
Thank you.
Cuban: Great job.
This is a great day
for my Grandpa Bud.
I know he's up there,
smiling down.
I'm glad I was able
to represent our family
and represent his ingenuity
and be able
to share that with the world.
