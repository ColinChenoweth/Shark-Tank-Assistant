I'm Yair Reiner
from Brooklyn, New York,
and I'm seeking $100,000
in exchange
for 10% of my company,
Frywall.
Frywall offers a simple elegant
solution to a problem
that every cook knows
and hates ?? splatter.
This is what your stovetop
usually looks like
when you're cooking.
It's splattered
with oil and sauce,
and it's sprinkled
with bits of food.
It's disgusting,
and you spend 10, 15 minutes
cleaning it up every time.
Frywall offers a simple,
elegant solution.
It's a silicon guard that rests
inside the lip of your pan.
Whether you're making tomato
sauce or cooking up bacon,
Frywall keeps the sizzle
in the pan
and the splatter
off of you and your stovetop.
[ Bacon sizzling ]
Unlike a lid
or a splatter screen,
the Frywall lets you see,
stir, and flip your food
at any time without ever
losing protection.
It's also great
for making stir?fry
or for cooking down
a huge pile of greens.
Smells good.
Oh, good idea.
Now, Sharks, please, don't try
that without a Frywall.
[ Laughter ]
When you're done,
just slip the Frywall
into the dishwasher and then
roll it up for compact storage.
Cool.
Sharks, you've shown America
how to bring home the bacon.
Now help me control the mess.
I'll pass out some samples
along with a glass of wine
you get to enjoy instead
of cleaning your stovetop.
?[ Laughs ] You're a smart man.
?Ooh!
John: Good idea.
Herjavec: Yair, I hope it's not
Mr. O'Leary's wine.
I wouldn't dare.
[ Laughter ]
That'll get you a deal
right there.
Greiner: You're out.
[ Laughs ]
John: Thank you.
?That's great. Thank you.
?Enjoy.
?Thank you, sir.
?Cheers, everybody!
Cheers.                Cheers.
Cheers.
?Salud.
?Cheers. Cheers.
?To Frywall.
?To Frywall.
?Cheers.
?To Frywall.
Nice wine.
That's a good start.
Will it burn?
So, it's made out of silicon,
which has been used
for bakeware for ages.
So it's safe to 450 degrees.
How did you come up with it?
What's your background?
So, I came up with it because
I've always been a home cook.
I invented this thing
in my kitchen,
and then I saw that nothing
like it had ever been done,
and everything I knew
about business
and everything I knew
about cooking told me
this could be
a really big product.
But, boy, it is really hard
to leave a paycheck
for the great unknown.
?Yep.
And then one day I went to work,
and I found out
that the company I was
working for was getting sold,
my division
was getting closed down,
and I was gonna
be out of a job.
So they made
the decision for you.
Three months
after finishing my job,
I had a prototype,
and six months after that,
I was out
in the market selling.
?That's motivation right there.
?That's right.
?Yeah.
?Is this patented?
Utility patented.
Cuban: Yair,
what do you sell them for?
What do they
cost you to make?
On average, they cost $25
and $5.50 to make.
And where do you
sell them?
About 70% of our sales
are online.
What are your total sales?
So, we launched the product
a year ago,
and we've done a total
of over $800,000 in sales.
Wow.
Good for you.
That's impressive.
Right now, we're in about
55 independent retailers.
Did you get approached
by any of the large retailers,
like Bed Bath &amp; Beyond
or Walmart?
Walmart, the price point
doesn't work for them,
and Bed Bath and Beyond,
I'm talking to the buyer now.
I like your story,
I like your product.
I'll give you $100,000
for 15%.
No royalty, Kevin?
O'Leary: No. Straight 15%.
I know what's happening
with the Walmart buyer.
I've been selling Walmart
my whole life.
When they put a price point out,
that's what they want.
They know what sells
in their stores.
Herjavec: You're very credible
and you're killing it.
I just don't know how
I can help you with it.
It's not for me.
I'm out.
If I were to give you an offer,
do you have other ideas?
I just want to know
where do you see it going?
Right now, we have penetrated
this market this much,
so there's opportunities
I think to potentially
license the brand.
There's opportunity
to maybe brand
or co?market
with home delivery companies.
See, but okay ??
It makes no sense, then,
for you to go into stores.
Why would you even
mess with that
when you're killing it online,
you have margins ??
He has to, Mark.
He doesn't have a choice.
?Of course he does.
?You don't have a choice.
When you have
a fantastic product,
you don't have a choice
but to compete
with any knockoff
that's gonna come.
?No, because ??
?You have to.
You go to stores,
all of a sudden,
the size of your company
has to grow exponentially
because you have
to deal with them,
you have to engage
with them continuously.
He has to do that.
If you're online
and you go to the Alibabas
to preempt the knockoffs,
that's where you get
your greatest strength.
Alibaba will take
all the knockoffs and him,
and they'll be cheaper,
and then the other ones
will get the money.
?Where do you want to go?
No!? I mean ?? No!
?Yeah, that's how it works.
I want to ask you
a question though.
May I answer
Daymond's question?
?Yeah.
?We're all trying to, you know,
determine his business
strategy.
I want to hear it from him.
Where does he really want to go?
Where I want to go is have
a defensible business
and one that's profitable.
Whether the protection
comes from IP
or protection comes from saying,
"You know,
everybody get out of the way
because I'm putting my product
here in the store
so you can't."
All right. I believe
you should go retail, as well.
It's free advertising
with some valuable real estate.
Ugh.
It brings people back
one way or another.
I'm gonna offer $100,000
for 15%, as well.
I'm gonna
show you something.
You know what this is?
?You gonna make an offer, Lori?
O'Leary: Are you gonna do
the corny thing?
?The Corny thing.
?Corny thing.
This is my golden ticket.
It's real gold.
The Golden Ticket goes to my
favorite product I've seen.
?Oh, my Lord.
?I have a guitar pick.
[ Laughs ]
What this means is,
I'm going to give you
exactly the offer you came
in asking for ??
It plays guitar.
?Ooh.
?the $100,000 for the 10%,
and I will also fund
your purchase orders,
giving you a line of credit
indefinitely.
The question is ??
are you going to take it
or leave it?
O'Leary: Do you have anything
to say, Mark?
I want to see.
Lori, I think you would be
an amazing combination
for this product.
I'm the perfect combination
for your product.
Because I think you know how
to get into retail.
I think you know ??
I know you know how
to get into retail.
?And infomercial.
?I got a counter.
$100,000 for 10%,
and I'll give you
my gold tooth from high school.
[ Laughter ]
Ticket?
I love the offer.
I love the ticket.
I do want to hear if Mark
has anything to say
about this deal.
?Ooh!
?Ooh!
Herjavec: So you don't
love it enough to take it,
even though she's giving you
exactly what you're asking for.
Wait a minute.
Narrator: One Shark is out.
Yair has three offers on the
table for his kitchen accessory,
Frywall, but he may
jeopardize the offers
by waiting to see
what Mark does.
The Golden Ticket goes to my
favorite product I've seen.
I love the offer.
I love the ticket.
I do want to hear if Mark
has anything to say
about this deal.
?Ooh!
?Ooh!
Herjavec: So you don't
love it enough to take it,
even though she's giving you
exactly what you're asking for.
Wait a minute.
I have worked really hard
to get to this point ??
Yair, first time
I'm giving my Golden Ticket ??
exactly what
you came in asking for,
an unlimited line of credit,
as well, only taking 10%.
O'Leary: But you still want
to hear from other offers?
I think it would be
disrespectful to Mark
not to let him have ??
This Golden Ticket
could vaporize.
Congratulations, Yair.
?Thank you.
?Great job.
?Thank you.
?Great job.
Lori, go like this ??
You've got a lot of syrup
all over you.
Oh! Come on.
You know, when I lost my job,
I could have gone
and tried to look
for another job in an industry
I didn't like anymore,
but I followed my dreams.
Yes!
Lori is the one who can get
the product on TV,
she can get it into stores,
and I think with her,
this product is gonna go
everywhere really, really fast.
Narrator: In Season 5,
we watched Nick Taranto
and Josh Hix make a deal
for their meal kit
delivery serviced, Plated.
Let's see what
they're up to now.
Taranto: We made a deal
with Mark Cuban.
Unfortunately,
we couldn't come to terms
and the deal fell through.
Hix: About a year later,
we were fortunate enough
to run into Kevin O'Leary.
He got excited
about the progress we'd made
and invested in the business,
and the rest is history.
When we pitched on "Shark Tank,"
sales were $350,000,
and this year, we'll do over
$100 million in sales.
These guys are going to now have
access to 35 million customers.
Plated was just acquired by
Albertsons for $300 million.
Man: What percent return did
you make on this deal?
1,346,
but who's counting?
This is the biggest acquisition
in Shark Tank's history.
?Hey, Kevin!
?All right!
Taranto: It's hard to overstate
how huge this deal is.
Customers can now walk
into an Albertsons store,
pick up their Plated meal,
just like you would
with any other
grocery product.
By the end of 2020,
our goal is to do more
than $1 billion in sales.
You're a household name
in America now.
You guys have done it.
The thing I love about
"Shark Tank" is that it allows
millions and millions
of Americans to understand
what it's like to start
and build a business,
and I hope we can inspire
more people to go out
and really swing
for the fences.
$300 million.
Cheers.
[ Cheering ]
It was a rocky road.
First I said no,
then I said yes,
and am I ever glad I did.
This is an amazing outcome
for Nick and Josh.
They're gonna become bigger
than ever because they got
a giant corporate partner
to make this
a billion?dollar business.
To Plated.
?To Plated.
Yeah!
[ Cheering ]
Greiner: Wow.
And I was actually
in the process
of applying to medical school
when I came up with this idea,
and I really saw this space
as ripe for innovation,
and so I literally dropped out
of the medical school
application process to focus on
this company full?time.
I'll tell you a little bit
about my background.
So, I'm a resident neurosurgeon,
and I went to ??
?You're a resident neurosurgeon?
?You're both in neurosurgery.
?Yes.
?Wow.
?Where?
?I went to college in Atlanta,
got my Bachelor's
and Master's in four years.
Bachelor's and Master's
in four years?
?Right.
?What took you so long?
I know. I watched a lot of TV,
what can I say?
"Shark Tank."
?[ Laughs ]
Okay, so now ??
But this is mostly mechanical,
though, right?
Because you're using
off?the?shelf sensors.
It's not really secret sauce.
?Yeah.
It's not very protectable,
and it's got to lead to
something else, right?
Well, wait, wait. Why is he
saying it's not protectable?
Is it protectable?
?Absolutely.
So, we've done
extensive patent search,
and we've filed multiple
provisional patents.
Herjavec: What's your vision
of going to market with this?
Yeah.
Because you haven't sold any
except Kickstarter.
What we're
working on now
is for you
to pre?program recipes.
So, say you know
that your chicken cooks
for 10 minutes on high,
five minutes on low,
and then off,
which most recipes
are pretty standard
that way.
You have to put your chicken
on the stove,
but then through our app,
you can click that recipe,
and it will modulate
the burner temperature for you.
Why wouldn't the manufacturer
of the large stove
platforms...
Thank you for asking
that question.
...just hire you as programmers
and do that?
Or someone else, frankly.
Because if they control
the distribution,
they control the device?
?Yeah.
?Yup.
So, with this device,
and I realize you've got
to have a broader vision
because I frankly think
in 36 months,
this will be obsolete.
?What are you talking about?
?Why are you saying that?
No, I agree with him.
I agree with him.
This is our entryway
into the kitchen.
This is a pain point now.
I mean, our Kickstarter
we sold because people identify
with the fact that they want
that peace of mind,
that they can just
turn off their stove.
Yeah, but that's only 700
orders,
that's not really
indicative, right?
Sure.
John: Those sales through
Kickstarter ??
what was the price
you were selling?
You sell four knobs?
We sold it as a kit
of a sensor and four knobs,
and then you can add
additional knobs.
?For how much?
?If you have more burners.
And how much was that?
And the average order price
was $250.
Cuban: So this is
a nice?to?have product,
but the bigger picture is,
this is hard?sell market
because even though
it makes common sense,
even though you think people
will have enough
self?interest, they don't.
That's why people die,
because they don't have
their smoke alarms
or they turn them off
or take the batteries out.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Whether it's a retrofit
that goes onto the stove
or we license our technology
to an appliance manufacturer,
this technology
will be there.
I like the long?term vision.
I get all that.
Appliance manufacturers
have approached us already.
Who called you?
We're already in discussions
with three of the largest
appliance manufacturers.
Look, but I have another
question about manufacturers
with this product right now.
?To license?
Yeah. To license
and white label it.
Correct.
I'll give it a shot. I'll give
you my honest opinion, okay?
$800,000.
I like money.
That's a lot of it.
?Mm?hmm.
?I'd give you $800,000.
From what I've heard today,
I see some massive challenges
in rolling out
the existing product.
For me to get back
my $800,000,
I fear I'm gonna die
of old age
because I'm getting
practically nothing here.
So ??
You value this company
at $10 million.
You haven't
sold doo?doo yet.
Yeah. Sure.
So let me say first ??
?Hold on. Guys.
?Yeah.
Speak to these Sharks
'cause I am out.
?Okay. Appreciate it.
?Thank you.
Thank you for your time.
Now, before you tell us
the size of the market
or things like that ??
Everybody tells us that,
but I hope that's not
what you're doing.
?No, no.
?You know, I like the product.
I'd probably get it
for my mother.
You asked for $800,000.
You would probably
have to sell $200 million
worth of products
and we get a distribution
for me to even break even.
That's with you not
making any mistakes.
So ??
I don't think you can do that
within the next three years,
and I hope I'm wrong,
but I'm out.
?Okay. Thank you.
?All right. Appreciate it.
So, let me just say something
about the valuation.
I know it's high...
but this is part
of $2 million seed round.
I'll take the seed round.
But not at 8%.
?Okay.
?Okay.
I'll give you the $800,000
for 20%.
?Wow.
?Oh!
Thanks a lot for the offer,
and so I'd love to counter,
and here is my rationale
before I give you a number.
If we stifle our valuation
at this round
and give away too much equity,
we're not going to be able
to raise a large growth
round and really scale. So...
No, I respect that,
but I guess I have a slightly
different vision.
?Okay.
?I don't want to build a company
that you're constantly
gonna raise money at.
?Okay.
?Let's build some.
?Sure.
?Let's sell some.
Yes.
And that will increase
the valuation
so you have to raise a little
less money down the road.
Sure.
I don't have a lot
of flexibility on it
'cause I see a lot of risk.
You got to go to market.
?Sure.
?Yeah.
?I appreciate it that, and ??
What's your counter?
You said you were
gonna make a counter.
Yeah. So, can I counter
at $800,000 ??
Can we make it creative?
I'll do it Mr. Wonderful style,
in a way.
?Yeah.
?[ Chuckles ]
Can we do $800,000
for 10%
but 2.5%
in advisory shares?
So that way, it doesn't
directly impact the valuation?
Grasshopper,
you are learning.
Yeah. I watch this show.
I just watch TV all the time.
Yeah, that's good.
It's interesting,
but I'm stuck at the 20%.
If you can do it,
I respect that, I'm out.
?Oh!
?He went out. Ooh.
Well, we're so far apart.
?Appreciate that.
?Thank you.
I freakin' love the concept.
I am that person who goes,
"Did I turn it off?
Did I turn it off?"
So I'd love to have this.
I'd love to be a part
of your journey.
My biggest problem is this ??
I don't see
a finished product.
So I'm worried about ??
Is it going to work?
For $800,000, I need to see
that working product,
and I wish I did,
but I don't.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Okay. We understand.
Thank you.
?I appreciate your time.
?Thank you.
?All right, good luck.
?Thank you so much.
?Appreciate that.
?Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
Now, we're talking about shorts,
right?
Let's pretend this watermelon
is the fruit of your loins.
[ Laughter ]
?Oh, my God.
?Don't get it on my clothes!
[ Laughs ]
All right,
fire in the crotch!
?Oh! [ Laughs ]
?That went well.
?Whew!
?All right, so maybe birddogs
don't work
on watermelons...
I told you.
...but they will work
on your berries.
Guaranteed.
?Oh.
?Berries.
So, Sharks...
who wants in
on this sweet deal?
?All right. So...
?Yeah.
I don't understand the
watermelon thing, but...
That was an attempt
at humor.
We actually have pairs
of birddogs
for you guys
that we brought along.
?That's a good start.
?We do.
?Yep.
?One for each of you.
So, here we are.
Daymond.
?Thank you.
?Top is yours. Yep.
?This is Lori's?
?That is Lori's.
?Oh, you have a female version?
?Here you go, Mr. Wonderful.
?Thank you.
?No, we don't.
?Here you go, Mark.
?Okay.
I guess a female
could wear them.
We're not
gonna stop them.
?Thank you so much.
?You're welcome.
So it's like built?in underwear,
but it's loose.
I'm not sure what's different
versus a pair of workout...
These are gym shorts.
Yeah, they're the best pair
of gym shorts on the planet,
but it's about
so much more than that.
They're the most comfortable
thing a guy has ever worn,
and he wears them
every excuse he gets.
How many of these
have you sold?
We are one of the
fastest?growing
men's millennial
brands out there.
I started three years ago.
Our first year,
we did $200,000 in sales.
Last year,
we did $2.1 million in sales.
Wow.
And this year, we'll do
$6.3 million in sales.
Nice. Nice.
How in the world
did that happen?
[ Laughter ]
So, I had spent
my first four years
out of Harvard Business School
working my way up
the executive ranks
at IBM.
I'm on a business trip
in the middle aisle,
can't move, and I have
the wedgie of my life.
?[ Laughs ]
?It's in this discomfort
that I decided to,
number one ??
I'm done climbing the corporate
ladder. Quitting that.
Number two, I'm gonna make
a pair of shorts
that makes underwear
obsolete.
I drive to a gym,
and I sell birddogs
off a folding table
in front of gyms.
It sold quick.
I bought more inventory
and began to build
the building blocks
that are birddogs today.
Not if you're spending $13,
right?
Greiner: Wait. Why?
Why do you have the best
marketing on the planet?
?So.
?Big statement.
When we sell guys,
we approach them
by telling them a joke
like he's at a bar.
We show him entertainment
and not advertisement.
But the bigger
question is ??
If my numbers are right,
you're spending about $400,000
a year on marketing,
right?
We spent about 20%
of net sales.
So this year,
we'll do $6.3 million in sales,
so that means we'll spend
$1.2 million on marketing.
You're making my point,
right?
If the advertising's good,
the less you should
have to spend,
not the more
because it'd be more viral.
People would be sharing it
on Facebook more.
Sure.
Because that's the whole point
of doing it this way.
?Sure.
?Right?
Your customer acquisition
should be going down,
but hopefully the effectiveness
of your ads is going up.
Right? So you see that
something's not right.
It suggests that the majority
of your videos
are not as effective
as you're trying to tell us.
Okay, but let's talk about
our competition for a second
in one key metric ??
e?mail marketing channel,
which is arguably
the most important.
The average open rate
amongst our competition is 4%.
?What's yours?
?40%.
?No way.
?No, no.
?40%.
?No, that's a false statement.
?No way!
?40%!
?40%!
?You lie!
Not only is it 40%...
[ Laughter ]
half of the guys that open it,
forward it.
My question is ??
For you to drive sales,
you're driving the cost
of marketing like crazy.
So to get to $12 million
in sales,
you're gonna have to spend,
what,
$2.6 million on marketing.
?Well, not exactly.
?Not necessarily.
So, first off,
we are 10 times better
than everyone else
selling clothes to guys.
You can't keep on saying that!
?Why? Why do you say that?
?Wait, wait, wait.
But you're gonna make
$1.3 million.
Greiner: You know what,
honestly...
Guys, how much cash do you have
in the bank?
So, right now,
we have about $600,000.
How much do you have in
inventory?
So, this single?biggest problem
we have is 1/3 of the time,
we have no inventory.
But you have $600,000
in the bank.
What's your lead time?
Six months.
So put yourself in my shoes.
Six months?
You have a six?month lead time
to make your shorts?
You're so full of [bleep] though
and everything you guys
are saying.
Narrator: All Sharks
are still in,
Greiner: Because you're saying
one thing on one side,
and then another thing ??
Thank you!
I never thought of that.
Why aren't you buying
the inventory now?
Because they don't believe.
It's not a matter of belief,
it's a matter of risk.
Isn't that the definition
of risk?
How much do you believe?
?It is, but there's risk
and then there's
smart risk.
Look,
if you were a true birddog,
and you were willing to put all
those beers in your pocket,
you would say,
"I got this." Right?
And the money's in there
because we're all in.
That would be confident,
but it might be foolish
because if I over?order
on inventory...
You couldn't come out here
any more arrogant
or confident than you did.
I'm out.
The more you talk,
the more present it,
the more unclear
the story became.
I'm out.
Daymond is
the clothing guy.
?So, yeah, um....
?What are you gonna do?
It seems like you were
teaching us business.
You were also telling
us about how
you're better
than everybody else.
So you shouldn't be talking
about other people like that.
I think it's a very elitist
attitude,
and I just wouldn't be able
to work with you.
So I'm out.
O'Leary: Okay, guys.
In all seriousness,
what happened here today
is you have $6 million in sales
this year.
That would normally get
a lot of interest here.
But you're arrogant.
You're paying the price for it,
and I don't think anybody
wants to work with you.
It's not funny, it's true.
I'm out.
And you are dead to me.
Get out of here.
?All right.
?Good luck, guys.
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
Wow,
that went sideways fast.
What a couple of [bleep]
?They were arrogant as hell!
?Totally arrogant.
Greiner:
They thought everything they did
was the best of the best.
