I'm Yair Reiner
from Brooklyn, New York,
Herjavec: Yair, I hope it's not
Mr. O'Leary's wine.
I wouldn't dare.
[ Laughter ]
That'll get you a deal
right there.
Greiner: You're out.
[ Laughs ]
John: Thank you.
?That's great. Thank you.
?Enjoy.
?Thank you, sir.
?Cheers, everybody!
Cheers.                Cheers.
Cheers.
?Salud.
?Cheers. Cheers.
?To Frywall.
?To Frywall.
?Cheers.
?To Frywall.
Nice wine.
That's a good start.
Will it burn?
So, it's made out of silicon,
which has been used
for bakeware for ages.
So it's safe to 450 degrees.
How did you come up with it?
What's your background?
So, I came up with it because
I've always been a home cook.
I invented this thing
in my kitchen,
Cuban: Yair,
what do you sell them for?
What do they
cost you to make?
Yair has three offers on the
table for his kitchen accessory,
Frywall, but he may
jeopardize the offers
by waiting to see
what Mark does.
The Golden Ticket goes to my
favorite product I've seen.
I love the offer.
I love the ticket.
I do want to hear if Mark
has anything to say
about this deal.
?Ooh!
?Ooh!
Herjavec: So you don't
love it enough to take it,
even though she's giving you
exactly what you're asking for.
Wait a minute.
I have worked really hard
to get to this point ??
Yair, first time
I'm giving my Golden Ticket ??
exactly what
you came in asking for,
an unlimited line of credit,
as well, only taking 10%.
O'Leary: But you still want
to hear from other offers?
I think it would be
disrespectful to Mark
not to let him have ??
This Golden Ticket
could vaporize.
Congratulations, Yair.
?Thank you.
?Great job.
?Thank you.
?Great job.
Lori, go like this ??
You've got a lot of syrup
all over you.
Oh! Come on.
You know, when I lost my job,
I could have gone
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
Now, we're talking about shorts,
right?
Let's pretend this watermelon
is the fruit of your loins.
[ Laughter ]
?Oh, my God.
?Don't get it on my clothes!
[ Laughs ]
All right,
fire in the crotch!
?Oh! [ Laughs ]
?That went well.
?Whew!
?All right, so maybe birddogs
don't work
on watermelons...
I told you.
...but they will work
on your berries.
Guaranteed.
?Oh.
?Berries.
So, Sharks...
who wants in
on this sweet deal?
?All right. So...
?Yeah.
Not if you're spending $13,
right?
Greiner: Wait. Why?
Why do you have the best
marketing on the planet?
?So.
?Big statement.
When we sell guys,
we approach them
by telling them a joke
like he's at a bar.
But you're gonna make
$1.3 million.
Greiner: You know what,
honestly...
Guys, how much cash do you have
in the bank?
So, right now,
we have about $600,000.
How much do you have in
inventory?
So, this single?biggest problem
we have is 1/3 of the time,
we have no inventory.
But you have $600,000
in the bank.
What's your lead time?
Six months.
So put yourself in my shoes.
Six months?
You have a six?month lead time
to make your shorts?
You're so full of [bleep] though
Greiner:
They thought everything they did
was the best of the best.
?They made Kevin look bad.
?"The best! The best!"
They were the best until
they had to put their money
