Yeah,
where's the baby, Paolo?
Well, I'm working on it,
actually.
?[ Laughs ]
?[ Chuckles ]
Cuban: That's cool.
So, Sharks,
this is the very first time
that you can actually
use a stroller
as a fitness machine.
So the Elliptical
Stepper Stroller
is composed by two elements ??
the carriage
Paolo, it's because
it's a prototype, right?
?Yes.
?So you haven't sold any yet.
No. No.
I'm in the prototype stage
What is it gonna sell for?
What would be the price?
?So, I had two models.
Actually ??
?It weighs a ton.
?What are you doing?
?He broke it.
$48,000,
that stroller.
Wow.
Um, it's $48,000, Kevin.
It has functionality,
but I got a big
question mark here,
Paolo.
?Yes.
?This thing weighs a ton.
?Yes.
?It is incredibly heavy.
Yes.
How is a woman supposed
to pick this up
Yes, but, Paolo, how is she
gonna put it in the car,
to Kevin's question?
Why you have to put it
in the car?
Would you put it in a car,
a jogger stroller? No.
To go to the park
or whatever.
Because I go to the park,
I'm going somewhere else.
Well...
I always have to put my jogging
stroller in the car.
Okay, but not all the jogger
strollers are foldable.
?Yes, they are.
?Yeah, they are.
Not all of them.
Paolo,
what did you do before this?
Okay, Paolo ??
Paolo, look,
Paolo, you put so much
of your energy
into getting patents,
Okay, look, Paolo, for me,
I don't see it, okay?
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Okay. Okay. Thank you.
Cuban: Paolo,
it's just too big of a swallow.
$500,000 ??
You know, the risk?reward
just isn't there for me, Paolo.
I'm out.
?Paolo.
?Yes, Lori?
I'm not willing
to risk $500,000.
So, unfortunately,
I have to be out.
You know, you made one
of the most critical mistakes
that almost all
entrepreneurs do make.
How did you get to the point
where you had enough money ??
$170,000
to invest in this?
How did you
get to that point?
You were sleeping at home
with a roach on you,
Paolo, you know,
you are so deeply excited
But you asked
for the wrong amount, Paolo.
For $500,000,
I can't get on board.
I'm out.
?Wish you the best.
?Thank you so very much, guys.
?Thank you.
?Me, too.
?Good luck.
?Goodbye.
Bye. Thanks.
