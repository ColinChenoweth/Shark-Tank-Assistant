My name is Pier Paolo Visconti,
and I'm seeking $500,000
for 40% of my company.
So, Sharks, a few years ago,
I was on the phone
with my sister who just had
the second baby,
and she was complaining
about the extra
pregnancy weight.
She didn't know
how to exercise
and stay with her child
at the same time.
So I knew right there
that I needed to come up
with a solution,
and what's better than combining
the most?used aerobic
machine by women
around the world
and a conventional stroller?
So that's how I got the
idea to invent the very first
Elliptical Stepper Stroller
in the world.
?[ Laughs ]
?Interesting.
Cuban: It's only
missing one thing.
[ Horn honks ]
Yeah,
where's the baby, Paolo?
Well, I'm working on it,
actually.
?[ Laughs ]
?[ Chuckles ]
Cuban: That's cool.
So, Sharks,
this is the very first time
that you can actually
use a stroller
as a fitness machine.
So the Elliptical
Stepper Stroller
is composed by two elements ??
the carriage
and the elliptical
stepper mechanism.
Now, the elliptical stepper
mechanism folds in and out,
so you can use it
as a conventional stroller
or a sporty one.
So, Sharks, I spent a lot
of time, money,
mistakes to show the world
that this was possible.
Now let's get together
as a team
and show the world
that this is a reality.
?Wow. Is this a prototype?
?This is a prototype, yes.
O'Leary: Okay. And these patents
you've received
are all on this prototype?
Absolutely, and actually,
I have seven patents.
How much have you spent
to get to this point?
Wow.
$170,000 of my own money.
?How much?
?$170,000.
And how much of that
was just for the patents?
?$72,000.
?Wow.
Do people just get on it and go,
or do they have to train?
?Is it hard to use?
?It's a stepper, right?
Okay, your fitness level
to use this stroller ??
Let's say I get on the
elliptical every day ??
Let me try.
I got to try.
Get out of here!
[ Laughter ]
Kevin,
you get in the stroller.
?All right.
?Go ahead, Robert.
?Yeah, Robert, is it easy?
?[ Laughs ]
It looks like it's
a reverse elliptical.
You have a brake on the right.
You have a brake on the right.
Oh, on the right?
Okay.
[ Horn honks ]
?It seems to work.
?All right.
Close the doors,
and let's go.
It's like a clown car.
I have no insurance!
Herjavec: It's cool!
Get it up to speed
and see how easy it is to stop.
?It's a little unstable.
?Brake. Brake.
?It's only a prototype.
?Yeah.
?Exactly.
?Let me give it a shot.
Brake, brake.
Robert, have you ever
been on a stepper?
Yeah, many times.
This is an elliptical.
Does it feel just like a stepper
but kind of...
It's a shorter step.
Yeah.
Go.
?He's gonna fall.
?It's gonna pop a wheelie.
You're not athletic.
Paolo, it's because
it's a prototype, right?
?Yes.
?So you haven't sold any yet.
No. No.
I'm in the prototype stage
What is it gonna sell for?
What would be the price?
?So, I had two models.
Actually ??
?It weighs a ton.
?What are you doing?
?He broke it.
$48,000,
that stroller.
Wow.
Um, it's $48,000, Kevin.
It has functionality,
but I got a big
question mark here,
Paolo.
?Yes.
?This thing weighs a ton.
?Yes.
?It is incredibly heavy.
Yes.
How is a woman supposed
to pick this up
and put it back
in her car?
Okay, first of all, this,
it doesn't weigh too much
because it's all aluminum.
The weight is here.
I understand ??
I understand...
Couldn't that
be aluminum, too?
Like once you make
the real thing?
Yes, but, Paolo, how is she
gonna put it in the car,
to Kevin's question?
Why you have to put it
in the car?
Would you put it in a car,
a jogger stroller? No.
To go to the park
or whatever.
Because I go to the park,
I'm going somewhere else.
Well...
I always have to put my jogging
stroller in the car.
Okay, but not all the jogger
strollers are foldable.
?Yes, they are.
?Yeah, they are.
Not all of them.
Paolo,
what did you do before this?
I'm a real estate broker,
and I came into this country
with 400 bucks in my pocket.
Guys, no money.
Actually, one night,
I was sleeping ??
no mattress ??
I was sleeping on the floor,
and then I feel like
something here.
It was a cockroach.
?Ew.
So what I started doing,
I started working three jobs.
Eventually after three,
four years,
I was owning three apartments,
and I got into real estate,
and I work on this project
only on my spare time.
It's interesting that you're
successful in real estate.
You take the money
you're making,
you put it into this,
with the passion
for solving this issue.
This is not me
solving an issue.
This is creating a brand.
There is a need for this.
Women want this.
If you ??
I went to South Pointe Park
in South Beach.
We couldn't do,
like, 10 yards
without being stopped
by women.
Okay, Paolo ??
Paolo, look,
if you had priced this at
$50,000 for 10% and grow, maybe.
$500,000.
You're right, the company
is not worth $1.25 million,
and I understand that,
but that's the money
I need to go
into production
and make these.
?First, look ??
?Yes.
You don't need money
for production
until you have potential
customers, right?
I have people
that send me e?mails
that they want to buy it,
but I need to go to testing.
There are other steps.
I was gonna say,
have you done
the safety testing
and all of the tests
that you need to do
for child safety stroller?
That's why I'm here and that's
why I'm asking ??
?Okay.
?You haven't done that.
No, I have not.
Paolo, you put so much
of your energy
into getting patents,
and this is such
a mature industry
with major manufacturers
that already have
established distributions.
Why haven't you gone to them
and said,
"Look, I have these patents.
This is gonna solve a problem.
?License it.
?License it from me.
Sell them for me,
and I'll take a 7% royalty."
?No risk.
?Because it's easy to say,
but I cannot go to...
?Why not?
?...and go inside the company ??
Herjavec: Why?
Why can't you
just call them?
They will license it
if I have a brand.
You have taken the hard road
to establishing market share
in the stroller market.
From scratch.
It doesn't really make sense
for me to give you $500,000
so I can compete
with companies
that already have achieved
massive distribution globally,
but I don't have to reinvent
that whole business
to be part of it.
I could just license it.
You don't seem to want
to take that path.
No, I didn't say that.
I didn't say that.
You told me you couldn't
even get into their door.
Because I can't put too much
meat on the grill.
Okay, look, Paolo, for me,
I don't see it, okay?
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Okay. Okay. Thank you.
Cuban: Paolo,
it's just too big of a swallow.
$500,000 ??
You know, the risk?reward
just isn't there for me, Paolo.
I'm out.
Okay. I understand.
I understand.
?Paolo.
?Yes, Lori?
I'm not willing
to risk $500,000.
So, unfortunately,
I have to be out.
You know, you made one
of the most critical mistakes
that almost all
entrepreneurs do make.
How did you get to the point
where you had enough money ??
$170,000
to invest in this?
How did you
get to that point?
You were sleeping at home
with a roach on you,
and then all of a sudden,
you had that type of money?
Hustling. Hustling.
?Hustle, right?
?Yeah.
You didn't have money
when you did it, right?
No.
You knock on door
to door to door.
Yeah.
I made my biggest mistake
when I finally got money.
I thought that money
could solve the problem,
and I spent $6 million trying
to build a brand that failed.
You see,
because you had that money,
that's why you made
the mistakes.
Because before that, you know
what you would have done?
You'd have taken
an existing stroller,
you would have repainted it,
cut the back off of it,
and welded
something on there.
And then you know
your next step?
You go to the ABC show
and all those children shows,
and just like people stop you
every five feet on the beach,
those buyers and manufacturers
and producers
will stop you as you're riding
around the show.
Money's
not gonna solve it.
You're gonna have to go out
and do this on your own.
I think you can,
but at this point,
I can't give you the money,
so I'm out.
Okay. Can I ??
Paolo, you know,
you are so deeply excited
about this and passionate
about it,
but you got
to stop designing,
you got to stop
getting more patents.
You have to have
the same level of love
and passion for the product
in terms of sales!
Go sell one.
Today, you have crowdfunding,
you have Instagram.
There are different ways
to sell stuff today.
You don't need ??
?I don't want just the money.
That's the point.
I don't want just the money.
I want somebody like you ??
But you asked
for the wrong amount, Paolo.
For $500,000,
I can't get on board.
I'm out.
?Wish you the best.
?Thank you so very much, guys.
?Thank you.
?Me, too.
?Good luck.
?Goodbye.
Bye. Thanks.
I understand that maybe asking
for $500,000 was too much,
but I didn't have anybody
to compare my idea.
So in my mind,
that was good to ask,
you know, for $500,000.
Obviously it wasn't.
How long can somebody keep
doing that elliptical?
Isn't that like
a 10?minute thing,
and then you're
kind of...?
No, I do an hour of elliptical
every night.
?You do?
?I do, too.
?Yeah.
?Oh, my God.
I burn 500 calories
doing that every day.
That's what I do.
?You do?
Every day.
47 minutes every day.
You're just stepping, up and
down, up and down, up and down?
And what's
your heinie like?
?I look terrific.
?[ Laughs ]
