Hey, Sharks.
My name is Akshita.
Ranjith,
how did you come up with this?
How did you invent it?
?Yeah.
"Akshita, I can't remember
if I turned the stove off."
I was like, "Oh, gosh!"
So we quickly rushed home.
Fortunately, we got back
before a big fire had started,
but we had a lot
in smoke damage.
So I said,
"Why isn't there a product
that makes the stove smart,
Ranjith,
can you take that off
