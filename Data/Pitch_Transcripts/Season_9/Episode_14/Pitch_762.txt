My name's Peter.
?And I'm Chris.
And we are birddogs shorts.
We're here from New York City
to give you the opportunity
to invest $250,000
in exchange
for a 1.5% stake
in birddogs.
?Oh, my goodness.
?[ Laughs ]
?1.5%?
?Whew!
Birddogs are gym shorts
with a built?in liner
that makes underwear obsolete.
Done.
Well, there you go, Mark.
[ Chuckles ]
?Underwear ??
?Oh, my God!
?Makes no sense.
?None!
Why would you wear
a pair of shorts
underneath your shorts?
What, are you gonna wear a glove
over top of a glove?
You're hiding
your thunder.
You're mashing and shaming
when it should be
a point of pride!
I mean, you're not gonna
throw a lampshade
over an Oscar,
would you?
No way!
Or jam a loaf of bread
into a shot glass.
?It's not gonna fit.
?No way!
Underwear is beyond
uncomfortable.
We combine
the feel of nudity
with the function
of a fanny pack.
I mean, look at this.
We got a phone pouch,
got a wallet pouch,
and two hand pouches.
And feel how soft
these babies are!
You're never gonna want
to take them off,
and you don't have to.
They dry faster
than your bathing suit,
and if you want to dress it up
and impress a girl,
you can easily wear
these on a date.
That first pair of birddogs
hit your door,
and you slide that liner
up your thighs ??
?Ooh!
?And that liner hits your boys?
Whoo!
?Whoo!
?That is comfort.
Chris, why is it called
birddogs?
"Birddog" is a term
that Peter and I
have been using for years
to classify and describe
a guy that, honestly,
we look up to.
A birddog is a guy ??
He could put 36 beers
in a parka
and sneak his way right
into Fenway with ease.
He's the guy that's getting
free guacamole on his tacos.
?What do you sell one pair for?
?Wow.
We sell birddogs for more
than it takes to make them.
All right.
That's why you went to
Harvard Business School, right?
[ Laughter ]
We sell birddogs exclusively
online for $55.
?Wow.
?It costs $18 to make.
That's a 67% gross margin.
Online, guys buy 1 1/2 pairs
of these on average.
That's an $83 order value.
Now, we only have to pay
for three things.
The shorts, shipping
to get them to your door ??
6 bucks ??
and marketing.
$13 on average per order.
?Oh!
?Wow.
13 bucks
to acquire a customer?
?$13.
?$13.
So, what happens is,
each time that cash register
rings online, 37 bucks hits
our bottom line.
That's almost
a 50% margin.
We actually have an intern do
37 push?ups
every time
an order comes in.
He's a big chest guy.
?Well, he is now.
So,
why is your cost so high?
Number one, we have the best
product on the market,
and it's because we spend
five times more
than everyone else.
Number two, we have the best
marketing on the planet.
Herjavec: Peter, have you raised
any money from VCs
in these last three years?
I have raised money over
the last three years.
?Oh, you have?
?What valuation?
Yeah.
I've raised $560,000
from our friends.
We sold at a valuation between
$3 million and $9 million.
So at this point,
we've sold 11% of the company
for $560,000
in outside capital.
You walk in the door here
and tell me
you're worth $16 million.
?Sure.
?You're crazy.
?And you're offering me 1.5%.
Do you think I'd actually
get up in the morning
and think of you
if I own 1.5%?
No,
that's their whole point.
?So, look ??
?[ Laughs ]
Typically,
companies come in here
and they have a flaw
in their product
or a tweak in their marketing
or they're in the mud
and they need to get out
and scale,
but we got the product
and the marketing right,
we got through the mud.
What I'm asking is ??
We need a shark
in our corner right now.
?Why?
?Because my friends
don't have the financial
wherewithal
to continue to find
our exponential growth.
but there are skeptical
about Chris and Peter's answers
regarding their men's shorts
company, birddogs.
Your investment
in your inventory
really tells me
what you think you can sell.
If you're the best
at everything,
how can you not
be planning ahead
to have inventory
constantly coming in?
Why would you have $600,000
in the bank?
?Because you'd be ordering ??
?Great point.
Even if they had the money,
if they had the advertising ??
All this work
that you're doing...
Yep.
So, Lori ??
...you would be absolutely
having orders go in every month.
You would never run out
of inventory.
Exactly.
So, this is the biggest
problem we have.
It takes us six months
from the time we order
until the time
the shorts arrive.
Six months from now,
we'll be doing about
$3 million
in monthly sales,
which means I need $1 million
in cash to pay
for the inventory in six months.
Now, six months from now ??
You know what, you're
bird?dogging the answers always.
I'm out.
?Hold on. Right ??
?Ooh.
?One second.
Right now,
I've got to make a decision
every time
I make an order.
?Your numbers aren't adding up.
?Do I shoot beyond our demand
and risk potentially putting
the company out of business?
No! What you're saying
makes no sense.
Well ??
And I'm surprised
you don't understand
that what you're saying
makes no sense.
How doesn't it make sense?
O'Leary: Guys, let's stop
for a second and ask a question.
?Sure.
?How do you think it's going?
Uh, I don't know,
I mean...
I actually think if we can get
serious for a moment,
a lot of the Sharks
think you're full of B. S.,
and that's a problem here.
I know! The number
are too good ?? Listen...
?Too good to be true.
?No, no, no, no, no.
They're not ??
No, no, no, no, no, no. No.
You were going
to say that, right?
?But, look ??
?But they're true!
I'm gonna make it simple,
Harvard Business School simple.
If you expect your sales
to more than double...
Mm?hmm.
...in the current year,
that means all your cash
should already be gone
if you truly believed that.
Well, Mark, good point, except
we're a seasonal business.
You have the world's
best marketing!
Your sales are going through
the roof! You can't keep up!
Everybody else,
you're disrupting
the hell out of them
because they don't understand
the millennial market?
So you're saying why
don't we just turn
the marketing machine up more?
?I sense some skepticism.
You know what, why aren't
you just ordering ??
Guys, either you believe
or you don't believe.
Brands grow at a certain rate,
all right? Meaning...
[ Laughing ]
Now you're dialing back!
?Hold on a sec here.
?Wait a minute.
You know, we're learning so much
from you, it's amazing.
[ Laughs ]
