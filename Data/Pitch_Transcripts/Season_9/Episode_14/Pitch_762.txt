Hey, Sharks.
My name is Akshita.
And I'm Ranjith.
And we're the founders of Inirv.
We're asking for $800,000
in exchange for 8%
of our company.
Oh, my goodness.
?Whoa.
?Whoo.
Sharks, how many times
have you gotten distracted
while you were cooking?
Whether it was screaming kids
from another room,
a phone call
that got you distracted,
or even worse ??
you left the house
with something
on the stove?
Well, Sharks,
you're not alone.
This happens to millions
of people
all around the world
every single day.
These situations not only cause
you to burn your dinner,
but can cause
deadly kitchen fires.
And that's why
we've created a device
to fix this problem
and make your kitchen
not only safer
but smarter, too.
Introducing Inirv,
a truly innovative
kitchen device
that quickly detects hazards
in your kitchen
and automatically
turns off your stove
so you never have
to worry again.
Here's how it works.
Simply replace
your stove's knobs
with our smart knobs,
and place this sensor unit
on your ceiling.
As soon as you turn on your
stove like you normally do,
both units will activate.
If the sensor detects dangerous
levels of gas, smoke,
or inactivity
in the kitchen,
it will automatically
turn off your burners
so you never
have to worry.
Also, you can monitor your stove
from our app at any time.
So just simply tap the button
and it will just rotate off.
?Very cool.
?So, Sharks,
who's ready to help
us get this revolutionary device
into every home
and onto every stove
so people around the world
get the peace of mind
that they deserve?
Where are you at in the
development stage? Tell us.
So, we've had a functional
prototype for several months.
We've been making aesthetic
refinements because it's
a consumer?facing product,
and also we've been making
technical improvements.
We launched
a Kickstarter in February.
We had a goal of $40,000,
and we raised 438% of our goal,
so $175,000.
?Wow.
?That's 694 pre?orders.
Ranjith,
how did you come up with this?
How did you invent it?
?Yeah.
So, a few years ago,
Ranjith and I
were actually in
a very serious car accident.
I broke bones throughout
my entire body,
most prominently my hips
and my neck.
So I was in a wheelchair
for four months.
?Ouch.
?Wow.
At that time,
my mom came to live with me
just to help me out,
and on more than one occasion,
she kept leaving
the stove on.
After I started
walking again,
I had gone for a movie
with my mom.
About 20 minutes in,
she turns to me and she goes,
"Akshita, I can't remember
if I turned the stove off."
I was like, "Oh, gosh!"
So we quickly rushed home.
Fortunately, we got back
before a big fire had started,
but we had a lot
in smoke damage.
So I said,
"Why isn't there a product
that makes the stove smart,
and why isn't there something
that can just retrofit
onto a stove that
you already have?"
Ranjith,
can you take that off
and bring it over her
so I can see it?
Sure.
The name of the company
is Inir?v?
?Inirv.
?Inirv.
What does it mean?
So, it comes from the medical
term "to innervate."
We both have medical
backgrounds.
I graduated from Duke
with a Neuroscience degree.
