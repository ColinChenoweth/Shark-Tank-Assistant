Kyle, that is the winner!
Barbara's right.
Your packaging's horrible!
I know that.
What do you want, Mark?
What do you want?
Got to be kidding me.
Hello. My name is Kyle Donovan,
and I'm from Brooklyn, New York.
And I'm here seeking $100,000
for 5% of my company, iFork.
Now, Sharks, let me
ask you a question.
Have you ever been to backyard
barbecue, a birthday party,
or a picnic and you went
and picked up
a cool, delicious cup
of lemonade.
And then you went
and grabbed your plate.
And you've filled
it up with food.
Now you have to do what I call
the "two?hand shuffle".
To eat any food,
you have to find some place
to put down your drink.
And the next thing you know,
here come Aunt Betsy,
and she wants a hug.
And now your fork done
fell on the floor in the dirt.
?[ Sighs ]
?[ Laughs ]
But I believe there's a way
we can eat, drink, and be merry.
It's an all?in?one, innovative,
interlocking system
designed to make
your life easier.
So now if you need a free hand
[scoffs] don't even
worry about it.
Gently squeeze your iCup
and slide it on in
till it locks in place.
?Oh, wow, that's cool.
?Did you see that?
?Whoo!
?Wow!
?That's cool.
?Of course,
you're going to want to eat
some of that delicious food.
All you got to do is slide out
your iFork and dig right in.
And when you're done, it nestles
right back into place.
The iFork product line
is a massive improvement
over traditional flatware.
The reason being is its
innovative notch right here.
That's designed to keep the part
that goes into your mouth
from ever touching
dirty surfaces.
Would you eat your food
directly from a surface?
Of course not!
That's nasty.
So why would you eat from a for
that's been lying on one?
?Huh?
?Now, you have a free hand
to do the latest thing.
?? Well, well, well ?
And be the life of the party.
?Yeah!
?? I got my iCup ?
? My iPlate ?
? My hand's free,
you feel great ?
? I'm about to eat,
I can't wait ?
? I got my drink,
I slid it in ?
? I got my iCup,
my iPlate ?
[ Music ends ]
?And with that ??
?Outstanding!
?Wow!
?Yeah!
?Great!
?Thank you.
I love the "iJingle".
I would love to pass
y'all some samples
and answer any questions
that you might have.
?Please!
?Let's see it.
? The iCup, the iPlate ?
? Da ?
It's nice to hear music
for a change, right?
Yeah.
?What are we drinking here?
?That's lemonade.
This has got
a little kick for you.
Thank you.
How do I...
put it back in?
Just squeeze it.
And utensils,
you gently lift them.
Slide those out,
slide those back in.
Thank you.
This is about a three?minute
learning curve.
But once you get it, you got it.
?Do you have a patent on this?
?I'm glad you mentioned that.
I do have patents.
If you notice right here??
I see, like, 16 of them.
Greiner: Do you have a utility
patent, or is it just design?
I have utility patents pending.
And I have quite a few
design patents.
And I did that mainly because
I was blessed enough
to get a 500?store test
for Wal?Mart.
So before the utility patents
were approved,
I was, like, you know what,
let me double back
and build a little patent wall
around this
to protect the proprietary.
Tell us a little bit
about yourself.
Well, my background
is quite interesting.
I actually grew up
without my mother and father
in my life
in the projects of Brooklyn.
And I guess I was
an entrepreneur all my life
because early on,
me and my cousin literally
used to go into garbage cans
in the streets of Brooklyn
and collect bottles.
And that's how we made
money for the summer.
And I ended up getting
my first full?time job at 15.
I worked in a photo lab.
And at 19, I opened up
my own photography studio.
?Good for you. Wow.
?Wow.
So I actually had some
pretty big accounts ??
EMI?Capital Records, Dow Jones,
New York Times.
And then I decided to start
a business magazine
towards urban professionals.
And at 26 years old,
I launched what became
the second?largest
urban business magazine
in the country.
?You've got to be kidding.
?What was it called? Which one?
?NV, New Vision in Business.
?NV? Yeah.
?I'm proud to say
one of your colleagues,
Daymond,
was actually on the third?ever
cover of it.
?Is it still active?
?It is still active.
I have someone now running it
while I focus on this full time.
This is all I do, eat, breathe,
and sleep. That's it.
But how did you get from
a magazine business
to this kind of a business?
It always bothered me
when I was at restaurants
and they would take my fork
out of my appetizer
and lay it on my table.
I was, like,
"This is disgusting".
Like, "I'm going to need
a new fork.
This is really bothering me".
You've had the Wal?mart story.
I got to hear about that.
Yes. Thank you.
You have a big order
from Wal?mart.
It was for 500 stores.
18,000 units.
This is before
the cup and plate.
Wal?mart actually has not
seen the cup and plate yet.
You're some of the first
to see it.
?They haven't?
?They have not.
So it's just the iFork
they bought into.
?So what did they buy into?
?They just saw the iFork.
Actually, the side
kicks right here,
that was actually
in 500 stores.
?Dollar amount.
?$26,000.
So I'm going to guess
what Wal?mart didn't reorder.
They told me I hadn't
built brand up enough
to warrant shelf space.
They didn't want
to take the risk.
And how did it sell in Wal?mart?
What was your turn?
Most of them sold out
in, like, two weeks.
It sold well.
The fork or the knife that
doesn't rest on the table,
I don't think is a problem
that needs to be solved.
What I think is this problem
that you are solving
is this one here.
The one where you actually
want to put a drink and eat.
This is the solution.
?Kyle, that is the winner!
?Yeah, I hear you.
So my question is,
what's the economics
on this thing?
And have you sold
any of these things yet?
I just got my first container.
In addition??
This is the magic.
?Yes, I agree.
?It's buying it as a set.
And what is the price
of that?
Ideally, when I get to retail,
I want them to retail
for $15.99.
Kyle, I'm going to guess
that a standard
comparative plastic set
is going to be around $10.
And you're at $15.99.
And it's
a better mouse trap.
No, I agree.
But it's definitely more ??
it's 50% more.
The challenge is, you have
to demonstrate it
for people to see the value
and really have it register.
?Right.
?That's another challenge.
Right, that's the hard part
right there.
Right.
Kyle, I'd like to make you
an offer, if I may, okay?
Bam!
I'll give you
the $100,000.
I do want 20% because
it's a very young business.
But the contingency I have is
that you redesign the plate
so you can hold
a standard cup.
I would guess 70%
of the cups out there
are the same size
and shape.
I know the drinking cup
always has a ridge.
I don't know if a wine cup
has a ridge.
If so,
that would be phenomenal.
Wine cup that attaches
to this.
Ohh.
But I think your price
is way too high
and the packaging sucks.
You'd have to really
redesign the package.
It's, like, it's out
of the 1950's.
But just a simple plate
that holds a cup.
If you do that, I'm very happy
to give you the money.
I'm very happy
to help you market it,
slam it into the stores,
whatever you need.
You know, I think you
cut yourself out of a very,
very large market.
You know, I like to use
Solo cups as a case study.
Solo was the one
I was thinking.
As a case study, they're doing
$1.6 billion a year in cups.
So if you just make it the plate
to fit every other cup,
you could lose that potential.
Could you design a plate
to hold a Solo cup?
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.
You got it wrong, Kyle.
You saw the problem
that $1.6 billion
worth of revenue
already has.
You don't lose the opportunity.
You get the ball rolling.
So if this plate ??
and I've got
my red Solo cup, and I pop it
in there, I'm going, "Wow!"
I mean, Barbara's idea's
a really good idea
because then you can
take any cup out there,
people don't have to buy
yours or keep yours...
?Yes!
?...or if they break yours,
replace it.
You're in the plate
business, period.
They can take any Solo cup
and put it in.
Barbara's right.
Your packaging's horrible!
No, I agree.
Your packaging
for your iFork sucks.
?Right?
?I concur.
Your packaging
for your kits sucks.
The fact that you
make up buy this
when people already have cups
in their closet sucks.
The fact that you've got this
where I have to have
these forks sucks.
But, but ??
But the lemon
cake is great.
But, but, but,
but, but ??
[ Laughter ]
Greiner:
That does not suck.
Herjavec: I would just
cut him off now and move on.
But that's okay.
That's okay 'cause you're
this close.
?To not sucking.
?Right? You're this close.
And for those reasons,
I'm out.
I thank you very much, Mark.
Really appreciate it.
Listen,
this is a good product.
It's clever. My concern here
is I think that the marketing
of this is going to be
a little tricky.
I think it's going to be
challenging to get
the consumer to understand
what it is
and sell it at retail.
And for that reason,
I'm out.
All right, thank you
very much, Lori.
Oza:
Barbara's quite brilliant.
I think you should have
seen that potential
where one second,
I'm going to design this
for the multi?billion
dollar cup market.
I'm out.
All right,
thank you very much.
Herjavec:
Yeah, Kyle, listen.
You have every excuse
to have an excuse.
You grew up in a bad
neighborhood,
you have to hustle
your whole life.
If anybody had the right to
come out here and complain,
it was you,
and you never did that.
Full respect to you
for that.
Thank you for that.
I mean, forget the excuses
and make the most of your life.
I'd love to be
in business with you
because you're
definitely a winner.
But I'm going to bow out
'cause I think Barbara's
a great partner
and that's a great offer.
I'm out.
Thank you, I greatly
appreciate that.
Cuban: What are you
going to do, Kyle?
Yeah.
Because not a lot
of choices right now.
I understand. Barbara,
I definitely greatly
appreciate ??
appreciate the offer.
Is there any way we can
bring the equity down a bit?
Kyle, based on the sales
that you have,
there's really no proven
traction on the sales yet.
It's a start.
Long way from the finish line.
It's on the table there,
Kyle.
Would you like to do
some business with me?
I mean, I would, Barbara.
Can we do the $100,000
for 15%?
?Congrats, Kyle.
?Good job.
?Very clever.
?Good one, Barbara.
Being a one?man show
for so long,
it took blood, sweat, and tears.
So to have someone like
Barbara as part of this
is nothing short of amazing.
[ Voice breaking ]
I'm very happy, very happy.
It was a long road.
I can't even believe I'm crying.
[ Sighs ]
Like, anyone watching out there,
if you feel the odds
are stacked against you,
maybe you don't have
your mother in your life
or your father in your life,
your parents in your life.
You know, don't give up.
Keep going.
You know, one day,
this could happen to you.
Dreams can come true.
