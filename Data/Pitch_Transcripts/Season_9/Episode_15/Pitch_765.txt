Hi, I'm Kat Nouri,
and I'm the founder
and the creator of Stasher.
And I'm here from
Oakland, California.
And I'm seeking $400,000
for 5% of my company.
Stasher is transforming
the container industry
by providing
a healthier alternative
to plastic bags and containers.
Plastics are filled
with chemicals.
So I invented the first
plastic?free
silicone pinchlock bag
in the world.
It has all the purity of glass
with the functionality
of plastic.
And Katie and I are
going to show you why
Stasher's becoming
and everyday household staple.
Meal time's always a challenge
for my busy family.
I always forget to take out
what's in the freezer,
like this piece of salmon.
You simply drop it
in a boiling pot of water,
sous?vide,
microwave, or oven.
Stasher's super compact
and it's super easy to use.
You simply fold over the bag and
you squeeze out the excess air
and you pinch to seal.
And when you're
all done with it,
you can just toss it
in the dishwasher.
So Sharks, what are you going
to stash in your Stasher?
And we have samples for you.
Lovely.
How long before the
salmon is ready?
Right?!
Actually, this is for you.
Oh, this whole Stasher's
for me?
So, yeah. So it's made out
of pure platinum silicone.
So there's no by?products
in it whatsoever.
Herjavec:
Thank you, Katie.
Greiner: Ooh, are these
those candy mints?
?Yes.
?[ Chuckles ]
So, Kat, what are the other
silicone bags on the market?
So there are silicone
bags out there,
but there's nothing that
has a male?female closure
that can seal by itself,
which means that you could
stick it in the microwave
or in the oven.
And the patents
are all on the seal
and the curve on the inside
so that it doesn't spill and it
opens up like a gape mouth.
Corcoran:
And what do you sell it for?
So you have three
different sizes there.
The prices are $9.99,
$11.99, and $19.99.
Isn't that a lot?
Well, it depends on what
you're paying for, right?
I mean, you're paying
for platinum silicone
that you're going to use
thousands of times,
endlessly, compared
to throw away plastic,
which shouldn't
even be something
that we're doing nowadays.
And I'm not even telling you
about the trillions
of pieces of plastic
in our oceans.
Oza: So what's your story?
How did you get to this point?
Give a little background.
It would be great.
Okay, so the exciting
part about me,
why I'm a good
investment for you
is because I'm a great jockey,
and I'll tell you why.
I've had other companies.
I've done very well.
I'm not just here
to make a buck,
I want to leave this planet
making a difference.
What were your other
businesses?
So I started Modern Twist.
And Modern Twist as
the first company
to make silicone
into a textile.
We have, like,
table runners, place mats.
They're all in, like,
Bloomingdales.
Kat, you must have
tremendous sales
if you're asking
$400,000 for 5%.
On an $8 million
valuation.
That's right.
I do have sales!
Let's hear about
that good news.
?What sales?
?Yes, absolutely.
$1.6 million in the 12 months
that we've been in the market.
?Wow!
?How does the $1.6 million
break down? Like...
Okay, so this part I really
want Mark or your help
in that. E?commerce.
So 50% of my sales
is in e?commerce.
So 30% is in Amazon.
But our own e?commerce
is only 7%.
Cuban: Kat, what's your
current blended margin?
63%.
63% on $1.6, so,
give or take $970,000
in gross margin dollars.
?Wow.
?$1 million to be precise.
Okay, $1 million
in gross margin dollars.
?Yes.
?Are you profitable right now?
?Absolutely.
?Okay.
Your gross profit
was $1 million...
?Yes.
?...on $1.6 million.
What was your net profit
on that million?
?We had $100,000 last year.
?Good for you.
?Great!
?Good job.
?Okay, so where did the $900??
?In the first year, you guys,
and I put all that into ??
because I want to be
$5.2 million this year.
Where does the $900??
And I'll say $5.2, but I'll
do $10 million next year.
You guys, this is
going to be $100 million company
in four years.
I'm telling you that.
[ Laughter ]
Love the confidence,
there, yeah.
What do you say?
What do you say?
You're just along for the ride.
?You're a beast, Kat.
?No, I understand.
Kat, you are a beast.
That coming from you is,
like, amazing!
I'll take that!
And I'm done!
She didn't come here to play,
that's for sure.
?I'm done!
?Kat,
you are a flurry of energy.
?Force of nature.
?It's almost exhausting
to listen to you. I??
Do you know, like, how fun it is
to be in front of the best?
No, no, I ?? I got it.
I don't understand
the advantage of the product.
And the product doesn't
get me excited.
I'm out.
Thank you.
I really appreciate your time.
Corcoran: You're a phenomenal
salesperson, all right?
And if I take you
on face value
and listen to all
of what you said,
I would be jumping out
of my skin to invest in you.
But then when I look
at your product,
the Stasher.
And you're opening comment
was,
"It's a healthy
alternative to plastic".
I see nothing on the packaging
or the claims
to say anything
about health.
And when I have this product
independent of your sales pitch,
I would not buy it
for the price point.
To me, it's another kind of a
bag, okay, at a very high price.
Okay, so you're
a phenomenal salesperson.
If you ever want to sell
real estate, look me up.
[ Chuckles ]
I appreciate it.
But I'm out.
Thank you.
Kat, why haven't you put more
about the environment
and the plastic?free element?
When I look at the back,
it talks about
the simplicity
of using the product,
but there's nothing
about your health.
I agree. Maybe that's something
that we should definitely
put on the packaging.
If you told me that and you
were one of my buyers,
I'd definitely
put it up there.
Yeah, but that doesn't
work that way.
And this is good feedback
on your side.
This is your vision.
You've got to be able to sell
this away from you.
Wait, wait, wait.
So you're just telling me that
you're looking at this product
and you're not seeing it being
as a healthier alternative
because it doesn't say?
I don't see that.
I don't what it does.
Everything you talked about,
the healthier proposition ??
Okay, Rohan, can I ask you,
you're a brand specialist,
what would you do
that would say that
that is a better option
and it's healthier?
I just want to hear it.
'Cause I ?? for me,
it's very obvious
when you're looking
at fruits and vegetables
coming out of there, I think
that's an intuitive thing
that you're saying,
"Why, what's in this?"
But Kat, it's not.
Well, what this looks
like to me...
Well, why didn't??
...is something
to store vegetables.
The story of cook it,
freeze it, store it ??
one, it's very light,
too hidden, secondly,
the whole fact this is
a healthier vessel for you
to cook, freeze, store
doesn't come through.
So that's a mock thing here
is the product story
is not being conveyed
for the package.
?At all.
?So can I put it back on you?
If you were to have
this concept,
how would you do it differently?
We can't do that here.
We can't reinvent it.
Look, Kat, we're
asking you questions
and you're coming back asking
us a question instead, right?
You're not saying, "I get it"
or "I made this choice
because"??
I do get it.
I swear I do get it.
But I'm just saying
that I want to see
where your point of view was.
I don't want to ??
I'm not arguing with you at all.
Kat ??
I mean, there's just not
an easy ?? for me.
?Lori's got something.
?Right, right.
Go ahead, Lori.
Kat, to Mark's point,
when you walked in??
Mark, don't go out.
When you walked in
to pitch us ??
Mark, please, nothing!
I just want you to come in
just because I want to prove
it to you that I'll kill it.
Well, then, make me
an offer I can't refuse.
And it seems that Kat is
targeting Mark for an investment
in her silicone bag company,
Stasher.
Well, then, make me
an offer I can't refuse.
You tell me
what's appetizing for you.
You want me,
make me an offer.
?Kat.
?Okay, I'm giving right now ??
Wait, wait. We have something
to share with you over here.
?I'm doing fi?? Yes?
?We're both out.
Okay, great.
[ Scoffs ]
Okay, I came in here
asking for $400,000 for 5%.
I'll give you 7% for $400,000.
?Noooo.
?I want you!
?You don't want me that bad.
?Not that badly, clearly.
?She wants you so badly.
?'Cause you will make sure
that I have a line of credit
if I get large accounts.
He will get you into
some of the biggest e?commerce
out there, so...
I know that.
Oh, you mean 7% is not enough?
Is that what you're saying?
?No way.
?Okay.
It's not enough, you mean?
Okay, what do you want, Mark?
What do you want?
?You want 8%? You want 9%?
?Inches. He wants to do it ??
I'll do it for $400k plus
a $400k line of credit for 20%.
?Oh, crud, for real?!
?But you want him.
?For reals.
?Ugh!
For real, Mark?
Okay, 15%.
