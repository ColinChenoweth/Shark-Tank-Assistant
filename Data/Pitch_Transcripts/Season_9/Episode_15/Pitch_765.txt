My name is Daniel Turissini.
I'm from Washington, D. C.
And I'm here seeking $75,000
in exchange
for 15% equity stake
in my company, Recharj.
Now, imagine your best employee
tethered to her cellphone 24/7.
She works a challenging job,
unsustainable hours,
gets texts from her boss
at all hours of the night.
She is the classic
high?value talent
at risk of costly burnout.
Now this is her brain.
And this is her brain on naps.
Power naps are a clear
performance enhancer.
And the fact is that one
in three American adults
said they do doze daily
when and where they can.
Now while companies
don't want to catch
their employees
snoozing at their desk,
a dedicated nap space is
just too cost prohibitive.
So where can weary type A's
go to rest their heads
and a nod off?
Introducing Recharj.
It's the nation's first
and only power nap studio,
designed for busy
businesspeople like you.
Recharj offers respite
from the stress
and strain of
the high?pressure work day.
So Sharks, I invite you
to close your eyes,
recharge your mind,
recharge your body,
and recharge your wallet
with Recharj.
?[ Chuckles ]
?And who would like to volunteer
to dive into one of
our power nap cocoons here?
?I'm in.
?I'll try it.
?Come on in!
?Sure, I'll give it a go.
Herjavec:
How does it work, Daniel?
So customers can either
drop in or book online.
And once they arrive, we escort
them to their power nap cocoon,
which is complete
with a pillow, eye pillow,
blanket, earplugs upon request.
This is superbly comfortable.
Cuban: It feels really good,
actually. Yeah.
It can stretch out.
They are wrapped 360 degrees
in a sound?dampening
opaque drapery for privacy.
We draw down the lights.
We turn up binaural beach,
which lull the brain
into a transitional state
of consciousness.
It can be a power nap.
Is there a scent?
Do you have a scent as well.
Yes, lavender scent.
So you have sound,
you have scent.
We tickle all the senses.
I like it.
But most importantly,
do you have Wi?Fi?
[ Laughter ]
We do have Wi?Fi, but we
collect all phones up front.
?No phones in our space.
?You do?
What do you do about slime
on the pillow
or makeup that rubs off?
I don't see a pillowcase.
I wouldn't want to be
on somebody else's stuff.
Absolutely, so we
take cleanliness
at Recharj very seriously.
All hand?touched materials
are machine washable.
In between each use, each of
our power nap cocoons
are hand inspected, flipped,
rotated, and cleaned.
?Just to understand ??
?So you don't really ??
so just so I'm clear
on that.
You don't actually wash
all the covers,
you're spraying them
clean kind of?
In between each use,
but we do wash them.
They are machine washed
on a daily basis.
?Ah.
?So, Daniel...
Herjavec: ...these are
standalone places I got to.
You're not suggesting I buy
these and put them in my office.
?Correct.
?Okay.
We are a studio.
Oza: How much do you charge
per bed?
$9 per power nap.
?What's a power nap?
?So ??
How long?
25 minutes.
?Okay.
?So if people are coming
from work, everybody's
coming at lunch, right?
So how do you handle that
the rest of the day's
pretty much
going to be empty.
Power nap is actually a hook,
but we are a more restorative
and regenerative
practices studio.
So we focus on sleep,
stress, and mindfulness.
Is it a class situation
or is it an individual
restorative situation?
So we have both guided
and non?guided.
Why not just drive home
and take a nap?
Like, why do go to a ??
?Too far away?
?It's too far.
?Too far.
?So the economics
are not making sense because
you're only asking for $75,000
for 15%.
How much have you
invested so far?
Yes, so I've invested $90,000
in the design and development
of the space as well
as additional $50,000
in operating expenses.
We were awarded a small business
loan in the amount of $158,000.
?That's not so small!
?In addition?
It's a pretty large
business loan.
Yeah, that's a loan.
Yeah, well, it's 6 1/4%
interest at a 60?month term.
Corcoran: Daniel, that's on
top of the money?
I still am totally confused
as to how much money
you have in this business.
What's the total investment
in your business to date?
Total we're around $300,000.
So how many studios do you have?
What does it cost to open one?
Absolutely. So our flagship
studio is located right downtown
in the central business district
of Washington, D. C.
?Uh?huh.
?We've got plenty of capacity
at our space to expa??
?What do you have right now?
?What is the capacity?
Corcoran:
How many of these beds?
So you're looking ??
you're looking between
800 to 1,000 square feet.
We've got 12 to 13 capacity.
Okay.
How much does it make?
Are you making
or losing money?
Recharj, as a studio
concept today,
actually serves as a short?term
loss leader or break even
to serve three major purposes.
Number one, we're
leveraging the location.
That was the fanciest way
of saying "I'm losing money".
Daniel, just give me the
economics. Don't justify it.
If you ?? half my
companies lose money.
We'll still sell them
for a lot.
So just give me the breakdown.
How much are we losing?
Why am I not surprised by
that, Rohan? But go ahead.
But they sell for billions.
We're going to break even by
the end of the calendar year.
We're going to make $130,000
in top?line revenue this year.
?Are you paid a salary?
?I pay myself nothing.
I still have
my full?time job.
?You do?!
?You do?
?Yes.
?Wait a minute.
Who's running Recharj?
Who's in there day to day?
I've hired
a subject matter expert
who has the sleep expertise.
She's been doing yoga meditation
in that restorative space.
Okay, well, Dan, Dan,
this is ??
So you're paying her
a salary.
She managers the day
to day operation.
Are there other employees
that do the classes
and do other things?
Yeah, so we've got
about a network
of 40 outside instructors,
and they really facilitate ??
?40?
?Well, it's a network.
They're part?time.
They're 1099's.
?But 40?
?They come in, teach a class ??
Well, remember,
we are not just a studio,
we also do a lot
of corporate events, as well.
So we plan on franchising
within two to three years.
Oh, Daniel, Daniel, Daniel,
you are so all over the map.
$300,000 so far to do
$130,000 a year
that'll break you even,
right?
?Correct.
?And that's including you
having 40 people going
basically door to door
to sell a wellness services.
Which there's a market for.
I'm not disputing that
there isn't a??
They're not ??
they're instructors.
They're not sellers.
They're not sellers.
Okay, well,
that's even worse, right?
They should be doing both.
Effectively, you have
only 800 square feet.
You have 12 beds,
I don't know what the hell else
you spend the money on.
It just doesn't add up,
Daniel. I'm out.
I appreciate that. Now would you
consider working with Recharj
as a wellness benefit
for your companies?
No.
[ Laughter ]
Well, he's annoyed.
Got to give him a day.
?Like a master ??
?Always be closing!
?I love that!
?He might come around.
?Daniel, I have ??
?No, let me just ??
Let me just tell you where else
I see your competition.
At Landmark Theatres, we have
these incredibly comfortable
couches and we have beds.
People actually go in there
when they want a break
and they'll bring
their eye covers,
they'll bring headphones.
And they'll just kick back
and they just pass out.
There's no privacy there.
Plus ??
There's no privacy here!
You got a curtain!
That's not competitive, Mark.
It's very different.
Oh, no, it's definitely
competitive.
I mean, there's a movie
going on in the background.
I disagree with Mark
that the Landmark
"Fast and the Furious 17"
lie down ??
Not every movie
is "Fast and the Furious",
right?
All right, so
"Driving Miss Daisy 7".
You can go to a movie with
subtitles that you don't even
understand
and just pass out.
Yeah, Mark, nobody's
coming to your movie theater.
Let it go.
My problem is this, look,
what you've tapped into
is obviously a huge need
in this country.
We push people beyond
the limits that we push to.
And it's completely
unsustainable.
So I think philosophically
where you're going, checkmark.
?I like it.
?Yeah.
But it seems like
a higher investment cost
relative to what you're
making in revenue.
So for me, the juice
is not worth the squeeze.
Well, can I give you ??
we're not ??
So I like ??
I like the idea,
but for that reason,
I'm out.
I appreciate it.
Now would you consider
working with Recharj
as a wellness benefit
for your companies?
I would be open to that!
I disagree with Rohan.
I just have
a fundamental challenge
with the entire concept.
Look, I sleep three
to four hours a day.
People say to me, "Oh, my gosh,
how can you do that?
I wish I could do that".
I don't do it by choice.
I do it because I have to.
So I would much ??
Well, think how much
more successful you may be
if you did take a power nap?
I would much ??
I mean, Arianna Huffington's
a huge champion for this.
I would much rather
be tired than poor.
You can be rested and rich.
Oh, come on, man.
I think most people
in America
don't have the luxury of
being able to leave their job
and go take a nap
in the middle of the day.
For that reason, I'm out.
We're seeing people do it,
but I appreciate.
And one of the things
I always say to entrepreneurs
or people that have ideas
is sometimes you just
have too many.
You're trying, like, an octopus
to tentacle out everywhere.
You can drown in
opportunity.
Yes. You have, like,
four tentacles going.
It's a good cause.
It's a healthy cause.
I like mindfulness.
I mediate.
But I think it'll be easier
for you and a better route
to take it to businesses,
sell those beds,
and get them set up.
I don't think the route
that you're going
would be a right
investment for me.
So I'm out.
?Thank you Lori.
?So you've got one Shark left.
?Miss Barbara.
?All right.
I'd love to be one of your
all stars, Barbara.
Put yourself in my spot.
Why would you give me
a couple hundred
thousand dollars
to open up another spot
only to break even?
That you claim
is a break even,
it really is never a break even
till you recoup your costs.
The model that we've built,
that we've invested in.
You spent the money on
a model that I do not
personally believe
is going to work.
And I'm out.
Thank you, Barbara.
I appreciate your time.
?Good luck, Daniel.
?Thank you.
?Good luck, Daniel.
?Wish you the best.
?Wish you the best.
?Namaste.
?Namaste.
?Namaste.
?Namaste.
?Namaste.
This is a new concept.
And while this may have not been
the best fit for these Sharks,
I'm the eternal optimist.
And I can't wait to see what
the future has in store for us.
Maybe I'm old fashioned.
I don't want people
sleeping at work.
When people come to my office
to work, you know what ??
?Oh, I ?? I don't.
?You want to let them do it?
Well, they're doing it
at lunch.
I want them working!
Cuban: I have no problem.
You know what ??
Yeah. Not always.
If I walked into
my office, Mark,
and I saw 12 of
my people sleeping,
they wouldn't be working
there much longer.
You know what,
I don't have a problem ??
I have no problem if they
take a nap
as long as they're still there
at 9:00 when I'm there.
