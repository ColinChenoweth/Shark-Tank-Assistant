Hi, my name is David Zamarin,
and my company is Detrapel.
I'm here today seeking
a $200,000 investment
in exchange for a 20%
equity stake in my company.
You see, a coffee spill like
this could seriously
ruin a chance of making
an amazing first impression,
like I'm trying
to do right now.
And luckily for me,
I came prepared.
?Oh, nice!
?Now this is a super shirt ??
a shirt that won't let you down
and won't let you walk
into a situation
looking like a mess.
Because this special shirt has
been treated with my product,
Detrapel.
?Wow.
?Oh, wow!
Detrapel is a super hydrophobic
liquid repellant spray
that is made to keep
your things clean.
Our formula shields
your belongings
from any liquid?base
substance ??
aka super hydrophobic.
Say you're watching TV
with a glass of wine.
And you accidently spill it
all over your carpet.
Watch as it beads
immediately off.
Wow.
Got to be kidding me.
Or maybe your kids step
into a mud puddle
with their brand?new shoes.
Oh, no.
Good as new because you've got
Detrapel.
Wow!
Or say you're at a backyard
barbecue, when all of a sudden,
you get a glob of ketchup
all over your t?shirt.
Or maybe you're someone
who likes mustard.
Corcoran:
Don't do it!
[ Laughter ]
How about some relish?
[ Laughter ]
You see, no matter
what you prefer,
the shirt always stays clean
because you've got Detrapel.
?And that's water?
?That's water.
Now the best part is that
one easy application
lasts a whole year.
With no glossy barrier,
no white discoloration,
and it's completely non?toxic.
Our formula is so safe
that you could even do this.
Oh, my God!
No need to worry
about carcinogens
or the need for protective gear.
Sharks, we're a young,
growing brand
that needs your help ramping
up production.
So if you want to keep
your dorsal fins clean,
then spray them with Detrapel.
How'd you come up
with the idea, David?
I grew up as a kid who comes
from very low?income background.
My parents are both immigrants.
My dad's from Moscow,
my mom's from Kiev.
And I came up with this idea
'cause I really cared
about my stuff
because I didn't have
that much money.
Then I got these two
brand?new Jordans
that I was so psyched about.
And I was so scared of
getting them dirty or messed up.
So I had this idea
that I want to come up
with some kind of spray
that you can put on and peel
off whenever it got dirty.
But I wasn't a chemical
engineer.
I was a freshman in high school.
So I actually pivoted my idea
and did a shoe?cleaning business
for all the local university
sports teams in Philadelphia.
Good for you, wow!
I ran that for
about four months.
We did about $25,000
a month in revenue.
?Cleaning shoes?
?Cleaning shoes?!
Cleaning shoes ?? basketball
shoes, cleats, you name it.
Why didn't you keep
that business going,
'cause that's easy money?
So I stopped the business
because I got an offer
to sell my first business.
And I sold it for $150,000.
?Wow.
?Wow!
Thank you, thank you.
I took almost all of it
and I put it into this.
This is all still while
you were in high school?
This all while I was
in high school.
Do you mind if I ask you
how old you are?
How old are you, David?
?I'm 19 years old.
?You're 19?!
?What?!
?No!
?Sweet, fancy Moses!
?You're 19?
?You're a beast!
?Oh, my God!
I thought you were
like 30.
So I sold the business, and I
began researching nanotech,
which is the basis
of the formula.
So luckily, I had a friend
who was a PhD from Drexel
who let me use their labs
and their microscopes.
So I went in during my summer
and I created a formula ??
?So you use nanoparticles?
?Yes.
Right, so explain
what nanoparticles are.
Yeah, a nanoparticle
is just, literally,
if you take a regular particle
and you take it to nano size,
it's 10th to the 9th ?? negative
9th degree, which means ??
?So it's a tiny particle.
?Tiny.
?It's so tiny.
?Extremely tiny,
you cannot see it.
Greiner: I have a quick
question, though.
Sometimes with nanotechnology,
it's so tiny,
it can go through the skin.
Yes, so we're
a water?based formula,
which is the main reason
why we're non?toxic,
eco?friendly.
It does not penetrate
the skin, then?
Your coating on your hands
and on your skin itself
has a natural wax coating
that will block anything
from going in either way,
unless you have an open sore
or an open cut.
So you create it,
you find a manufacturer...
So we had a manufacturer
that added a 1% to
2% proprietary part,
something that was crucial
to the product
that we were trying to sell.
And eight months down the line,
they went bankrupt,
and they refused to disclose
that 2% proprietary part.
So I went on, pretty much,
a three?year hiatus
trying to re?engineer
this formula.
But, David,
where are you now?
I'd like to hear the end
of the story.
So the original formula
is no longer what we have.
There has been a couple
slight changes.
I went into a lab and we
created this same formula.
?It's your product.
?Now it's 100% ours.
Your pro?? And what are
your sales today?
This year, we're on track
to do $300,000 to $350,000.
And who do you sell them to?
Who's your main customer?
Now, we've really
been mainly b?to?b.
So you're selling to
other businesses,
what kind of businesses
are buying this?
Yeah, the businesses that are
either creating products
for consumers that they can buy,
like, furniture,
like, carpet for example.
Have you done any safety
testing on this?
We have FDA testing done.
We adhere to all the EPA
compliance regulations.
What do you charge
for it, David?
This is a sample size, but we
also sell as our travel size.
We sell this for $12.99.
And what's your cost?
To make this, $1.14.
?Great margin.
?You're selling this
for $12.99 where?
Directly on our website
right now.
Is it patented?
Do you have a patent
on this thing or not?
No, we haven't. Not yet.
How hard would it be
for somebody to knock it off?
I went to some of the largest
nano?tech companies in the world
that specifically
do things like this.
None of them were able to do
what we were able to do
eventually.
See, that scares me
a little bit.
Why do I find it
too good to be true?
That's because I'm young,
but I'm telling you here
that I'm ??
Age isn't the issue.
?What's that?
?Age isn't the issue.
If I took $200,000 and went out
and hired somebody,
could I recreate Detrapel?
No.
I believe that wholeheartedly
that you won't be able to do it.
That's simply because of
our process and on top of that,
the way that we market.
Okay, I'll shortcut this,
David.
I'll give you the $200,000,
want 25%,
and I'll put a stipulation
that you own the formula.
I'll put you in touch
with my other nano guys
who know this stuff
a whole lot better,
have all the technology,
and we can get you going.
What do you want to do?
Um...
No. Wait.
David has one offer
on the table from Mark ??
$200,000 for 25% of his
stain?repellent Detrapel.
But Lori also seems interested.
What do you want to do?
No. Wait.
I will give you an offer
for $200,000, also for 25%.
Again, I want to make sure
that all of your testing,
all of that, shakes out.
Would you consider
partnering together?
I don't know.
What's your ultimate goal?
The ultimate goal is to extend
to an actual chemical company
that does an array
of cleaning lines ??
or maybe not even cleaning,
but really protectant line.
So what is the one thing
that you think sets you apart,
that you came up with,
that is your golden ticket?
All of our products
are on a nano level.
Most companies only focus
on one thing.
By the way, I'm going
to throw in as well.
I'll give you $200,000
for 25%.
Okay, thank you all
for your offers.
So back to my question.
What expertise do you need
to get where you want to go?
I really need help on
the business side of it.
Not necessarily
on the chemical side ??
I think we can figure
that part out of it.
You want brand?building,
distribution, route to market?
That's why I'm here. I need the
right people to work with me.
All right, if that's
what you need, then,
I would go in with Lori,
right?
'Cause if it's
the business side,
we both can complement
each other.
Plus, I've got some
really strong investments
in the nano side.
Well, David, look.
Nano schmano.
I don't care.
You figure it out.
You're a 19?year?old
dynamo, my friend.
?Thank you.
?This is incredible.
I appreciate it.
I would love to be in with you.
And I would love to
have my friend Rohan
go in with me,
if he's open to it.
I was thinking $200,000
for...
23%.
Just a little sweeter,
just a little bit better
than the other Sharks.
?Thank you.
?Rohan?
I'm in, Robert's
highly successful,
he knows technology,
he's built stuff,
I know how to build
brands.
You know, there's big,
major companies
out there looking
for innovation like this.
They come to me to help
go find the innovation.
Robert brings a skill set
that I don't have.
Together,
it's a dynamic duo.
Mark and I have decided
that we will go in together.
I am very fast to market,
and what I do is infomercials,
TV, and retail.
?I see that this ??
?'Cause none of us have ever
done an infomercial.
Well, I'm not going to comment
on what anybody else does.
I only know what I can do.
And I think that you
do need to move fast,
you do need to blitz
the market.
I think that Mark and I
can do that for you.
I don't think necessarily
I'm your best partner in this.
I think Lori and Mark are
an unbeatable combination
and you should grab
the money and run.
I'm out,
but go with these two.
Thank you.
Lori and I are offering you
$200,000 for 25%.
Rohan and Robert made
some crazy,
ridiculous offer
that's irrelevant,
but it turned out to be
$200,000 for 23%.
'Cause we've never built
brands on our own.
We don't know how
to make mega brands.
What would you
like to do?
All right.
David, there's something
that Rohan and I have that,
with all due respect to Lori
and Mark, they don't have.
We're immigrants to this country
and we came here with nothing.
If anybody here
understands hard work,
I think that we can help you
get to where you want to go.
?Robert!
?We understand that hunger.
?Robert.
?I like that Robert.
?Yeah, but ??
?Time to decide, David.
?Congratulations, David.
?Thank you.
?You'll be fine.
?Thank you so much.
?Appreciate it.
?This is very cool.
?Yeah, yeah.
?Congrats, man.
?Good job. Both of you.
?Thank you so much.
Thank you, thank you.
[ Both laughing ]
Lori knows all about branding,
all about products,
and we are
a product?based business.
And Mark has the online
side covered.
He's in the nanospace.
It's just the perfect
win?win situation.
What was the
immigrant card, Robert?
?Obviously, I had no idea.
?The immigrant card.
?Talk about a Hail Mary.
?I was with you!
I'll be the first to admit,
it was, like, bam!
