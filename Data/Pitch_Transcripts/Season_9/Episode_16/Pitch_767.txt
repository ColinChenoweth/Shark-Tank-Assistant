We had two

Everything is riding

Joe: The other Joe.
Sorry, Joe, were you selling
the product in grocery stores,
or were you just
driving around to festivals,
Well, Joe Jr., you're not worth
a million bucks, buddy.
I'm sorry.
Are you kidding me?
You'd be making
a great bet, Kevin.
Absolutely.
To give you $150,000,
I'd have to get about
50% of your business.
That's what it's worth today.
I'm not saying you won't
grow it, but I'm out.
Well, I'm going to share
with you my thoughts.
For me, it tasted fabulous.
But not every business, to me,
is right for an investor.
I think you're doing great,
I think you're
an amazing salesperson,
Well, he has given all authority
to Joe to make the decisions.
Absolutely.
I can't make you an offer
under which
you're still going
to be smiling.
I just can't.
You could try, Robert.
Narrator: Three Sharks are out.
Joe's Gourmet Fish Fry,
but is unsure about an offer.
Herjavec: Alright, guys.
I can't make you an offer
under which
you're still going
to be smiling.
I?I just can't.
You could try,
Robert.
I can't do it.
I'm out.
