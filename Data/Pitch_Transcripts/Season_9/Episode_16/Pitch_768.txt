Joe: We were in New Orleans
when Katrina hit.
We had two
restaurants there.
And, all in one day,
everything changed.
Everything was lost.
All that survived
were two fryers.
Me and my dad hit the road
all across the country.
Boy, this is good.
This is good?
This is the one
right here.
My dad heavily invested
in our business.
He gave me
his entire retirement.
Him and my mom
sold their house,
and have been immersed
in this business since.
We are all in ??
financially, spiritually.
Everything is riding
on Joe's.
And we wouldn't have it
any other way.
We wouldn't.
Hi.
I'm Joe Dowell.
And I'm his wife
Maranda Dowell.
And we're here
from Atlanta, Georgia,
seeking an investment
of $150,000
for a 15% stake
in our company,
Joe's Gourmet Fish Fry.
We are here to introduce
you to a product
that will change the way
you eat seafood forever.
Now anyone can make the
best?tasting seafood at home,
with Joe's Gourmet
Fish Fry.
It is a delicious,
all?in?one seafood breading mix
that's crushing
any other breading mix.
And it's not just
for seafood.
You can bake
or air?fry with it.
You want crispy?fried
chicken?
Mm?hmm.
Yeah.
Try Joe's.
How about savory,
fried green tomatoes?
Try Joe's.
Hmm.
Scrumptious crabcakes,
anyone?
I'll take one.
Try Joe's.
Maranda: Over the years,
we have one simple truth.
When people try it...
...Oh, they gonna buy it!
[ Laughter ]
With that being said,
who's ready to try it?
Oh, we got to try it!
?Buy it.
?Definitely.
And have the whole
world experience
their own
emotional reaction
to Joe's Gourmet Fish Fry.
[ Laughter ]
Alright, let's get
to the samples.
You got us so excited!
Let's get down
to business, folks.
Okay.
Try this.
This is the real deal.
What you're about to taste
is the truth, folks.
What we got here
is just to show you
how versatile
the breading is.
Thank you.
We have shrimp,
some zucchini,
a piece of halibut,
even a scallop.
Oh my God, the chicken
is fantastic.
Greiner: Ooh.
I do like it.
Oh yes, that's the ?? that's
what we were waiting on.
That right there.
Mmm.
Mmm.
?The shrimp is so good.
?You complete me.
?Really good.
?Mmm, it is amazing.
?Can we see the bags?
?Can we get some bags?
?Absolutely.
So, it's called "Fish Fry"
but you applied it
to both vegetables and ??
Anything you
can fry, right?
Anything ?? and it's
on the packaging ??
the different applications
you can use it on.
Or you could add
"not just" Fish Fry.
?There you go.
?Absolutely.
Okay.
What are your numbers?
One bag costs us
$1.22 to make.
We sell it directly
to the consumer for $5.
When we sell it to a wholesaler,
it's from $2.25 to $2.75,
and our retailers sell it
anywhere from $2.99 to $4.25.
What are your lifetime
sales to date?
We've sold $409,000
worth of product.
?That's really great.
?And this year ??
what do you think
you'll do this year?
This year, we're going to
finish out at about $270,000,
and next year
we're projecting $450,000.
?Good for you.
?And the reason being
we've only been
in Wal?Mart.
This is our
seventh week, guys.
?Yeah. Oh, wow.
?And the sales are climbing.
We're super?excited.
John: And have you done
any on?site?
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
You've done on premise?
That is what we do.
Every week you will find us
selling somewhere.
We go out there with three
palettes of our product,
and we don't leave
until it's sold.
?You still do that today?
?That's clever.
Absolutely.
We still do it.
Every week.
Herjavec: How did you and
Maranda come up with this?
Well, I'm just a blue?collar
worker, you know.
I started off ??
No such thing as "just".
?Nothing wrong with that.
?Yeah, there you go.
I started off in manufacturing,
but I found my passion
when I started
waiting tables.
You know, I enjoyed
serving others,
so I saved up my money,
called my dad,
and said,
"Hey, I got a great idea.
Why don't you give me
all of your money?"
And surprisingly,
he did.
He did.
And, so, we went into business,
opened up my first restaurant,
and that's where I met
this lovely young lady.
Yes, so we met the first time
in one of his restaurants.
I went in to sell him
some advertising.
But the funny story is,
you guys,
as soon as I walked
into this restaurant,
I met him.
He said, "You know what?
I think you're the woman
I'm going to marry".
Aww.
Aww.
I didn't see him again
for eight years after that.
No!
Seriously.
I saw him on the corner,
in this little tent
that you see on the bag,
with his dad.
Joe: The other Joe.
Selling these fish plates,
and he walks up to my car,
and he says,
"Are you married?"
And I'm like, "No".
And he said, "You know what?
You're about to be".
And two weeks later,
I had this ring on my finger.
No!
Yes.
Yeah!
John:
So, guys, how long were you
doing the business ??
the restaurant business?
Well, the restaurant's
done very well.
We ended up opening up
six restaurants.
Okay. That's good.
?Wow.
They still going?
Absolutely not.
Oh.
Ooh.
Well, being from New Orleans,
Katrina hit,
and kind of shut
everything done.
Oh, my God.
But the only thing
that was saved in there,
I had these two fryers
that was in storage,
so I took a tent,
grabbed those two fryers,
and I went to any festival,
any concert
from Chicago to Miami,
and everything in?between,
selling this finished product.
And how long were
you doing that ??
just hitting the streets?
That was about
15 years.
Yeah, about 15 years.
15 years of hitting
the corner?
I got some fryers
in the car right now.
I'm still frying fish.
Sorry, Joe, were you selling
the product in grocery stores,
or were you just
driving around to festivals,
frying food and selling it?
So, I'll tell you
how that happened.
One day, I went out
to the festival.
He had a line of people
wanting food in the front,
but then he had people with,
like, Tupperware and baggies,
and he's like, "I don't have
time for those people.
They want to take it home,
and they want to fry it
themselves,
and I'm trying to make
some money out here".
Yeah. Yeah.
And the light bulb
went off.
And I said, "Dude,
this is our business.
Let's bag it and sell it".
How long ago was that,
Maranda?
This is our third year.
So, I went out to our little,
local grocery store.
They've got about
eight locations,
and it just
started selling.
Is this still
New Orleans?
We're in ??
We live in Atlanta now.
Now, okay.
So, basically, since
those eight stores,
we're now in 800 stores.
We're in 315
Wal?Mart stores.
We're going into
52 Kroger stores.
?Wow.
?We're in 142 Publix...
?Fantastic.
?Wow.
...Meijer and ATB.
And that is really
hard to do.
Alright, how much of your money
do you have invested
in this business?
Um, It's a total of $50,000
from the family.
Well, my dad
owns 80 ??
85.
85%.
What?
But ?? But here's
the deal, guys.
We are a very
strong?knit family.
If you knew me back in the day,
my credit was zero.
I'm right there with you.
So ??
Same here.
In order to get this thing
rolling, he was our front guy.
Alright, guys.
I'm just looking at it,
and saying to myself,
"Okay,
how do I get there
as an investor?"
You asked me for 15% here,
for $150,000.
That imputes
a million?dollar value.
Yes.
Okay.
As an investor,
how many times
am I paying to get
to that million value?
25 times.
There are no food companies
on the planet Earth
trading at a 25?multiple
for fish fry, okay?
Well, let me
tell you this.
What your missing
is the consumer.
Well, I'm not missing 'em.
This is how all ??
like you say,
your little soldiers,
your money?soldiers.
Yeah, yeah.
This is how ??
I don't want them to die.
They're all dead.
I don't want them to die.
I want them to come back with
prisoners, you know that.
So, listen ??
so the consumer is this.
That's where our
expertise is.
Well, Joe Jr., you're not worth
a million bucks, buddy.
I'm sorry.
Are you kidding me?
You'd be making
a great bet, Kevin.
Absolutely.
To give you $150,000,
I'd have to get about
50% of your business.
That's what it's worth today.
I'm not saying you won't
grow it, but I'm out.
Well, I'm going to share
with you my thoughts.
For me, it tasted fabulous.
But not every business, to me,
is right for an investor.
I think you're doing great,
I think you're
an amazing salesperson,
and you're killing it
at the fairs,
but I wouldn't feel
good investing,
and for that reason, I'm out.
Thank you.
Alright.
Thank you.
Cuban: Okay, so kind of
from my perspective,
it's got to be a product
that not just that I love,
but I can demonstrate.
My idea of cooking
is taking a hot dog,
wrapping it in a paper towel,
and putting it in the microwave,
and saying,
"Damn, this is good".
Right.
It's just not a product
that really fits who I am,
so I'm out,
but I congratulate you.
Thank you.
You guys grind,
you guys hustle.
You are a perfect example of ??
if an entrepreneur
is relentless,
anything is possible.
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
Thank you, thank you.
Herjavec: You know, to Mark's
point ?? I love you, guys.
You're smiling. We're throwing
a lot of stuff at you.
Here's what I don't know ??
how do I invest $150,000
when your dad owns 85% of it?
Well, he has given all authority
to Joe to make the decisions.
Absolutely.
I can't make you an offer
under which
you're still going
to be smiling.
I just can't.
You could try, Robert.
Narrator: Three Sharks are out.
Robert likes Maranda and Joe's
fish breading product,
Joe's Gourmet Fish Fry,
but is unsure about an offer.
Herjavec: Alright, guys.
I can't make you an offer
under which
you're still going
to be smiling.
I?I just can't.
You could try,
Robert.
I can't do it.
I'm out.
But you still have
one shark left.
And then
there was one.
I think we've all been wrestling
with a couple of things here.
Yes, the valuation,
but here's why I love you ??
you're standing on corners,
and when you stand on corners,
you are getting paid
to have a focus group,
you know what your customers
like and don't like.
Yeah.
I stood on corners eight years
trying to sell my hats,
and when you stand on the corner
of the Apollo Theater
trying to sell a hat
in the middle of Harlem??
That's it.
They tell you what they think
about your hat and your mama.
You know it.
You know them.
So, I get it.
I've got an offer for you.
$150,000 for 25%.
?Say "Yes".
?Say "Yes" to that deal.
That's a good one.
Say "Yes".
So, Maranda, you just sold
Fish Fry for $600,000 valuation.
Now that is selling.
Maranda: A deal with Daymond
is amazing.
He went all?in, and we
are so grateful for it.
Narrator:
In Season 7, Dave Vasen made
a deal with Mark Cuban
