Winowich: Hi, Sharks.
My name is Princess
Michelle Winowich
from Bloomfield Hills, Michigan.
I am the prouder founder
of G. O. A. T. Pet Products.
We're here today seeking
a G. O. A. T partner
to invest $499,000
in exchange for 9%?equity
in our company.
[ Laughter ]
Whew.
Pet lovers have
all shared the dream
of wishing their
pets could talk,
just like in fairy tales.
Now, what if I told you
that I have the power
to give your pet a voice?
Meet Axel, a retired canine
hero that can speak.
Isn't that right, Axel?
Axel: That's right,
Princess Michelle!
Canine Axel, reporting for duty!
What?
Sharks, I'm not
really a princess,
Axel: You're so right,
Michelle.
But in addition to
giving me a voice,
the G. O. A. T. Pet Speaker
does so much more, like ??
I'll take it from here,
Axel, but thank you.
Not only does the G. O. A. T. Pet
Speaker give your pet a voice,
you can also stream your
favorite tunes out on walks.
What?
? So dream on,
dream on, dream on ?
Or to help relieve pet anxiety,
you can stream calming,
soothing classical music.
Michelle, before
I figure out
if you're on a sabbatical
from Bellevue,
why are you dressed
like Snow White?
Snow White always
talked to animals,
O'Leary:
Michelle, is there a reason
you would have spent time
making this product?
What made you want to do it?
So, can I pass out some samples?
Can I have you take
a look at it?
Wow, what a beautiful dog.
Fairy tale packaging.
Thank you.
It's ?? I did bring an extra
treat for Mr. Wonderful.
?Do I get the apple, too?
?Poisoned apple?
He's not going to
rip us to shreds
if we don't do
a deal, is he?
Well, Michelle, you have
a $5,000,000?valuation.
No problem there,
Robert.
No, no, no.
This thing
makes dogs talk.
"That's cheap, Robert".
Obviously, if you have
a $5,000,000?valuation ??
Mm?hmm?
You sold a lot of
talking dog units.
The G. O. A. T.
Pet Speaker.
Why G. O. A. T.?
Greatest Of All Time.
Winowich: When I went to Global
Pet Expo to launch this,
people literally, without
exaggerating,
were lining up to see.
I've been to these
trade shows ??
Did you get
orders there?
I did. I wrote more orders
than I have in 10 years
on my first day.
Michelle, I am shocked that
they gave an order that big
because it's an enormous risk
for them on something
that is not tested or proved.
This is not something
that I could invest in,
in Michelle's pet speaker
company, G. O. A. T.
Herjavec: We don't really know
where it's going to go,
You know, Michelle,
you could counter.
I?I'm going to say "No".
I'm going to tell you
that right now.
$500,000 is a lot
of money.
Mm?hmm.
Michelle,
you asked for $499,000.
That's a lot of money.
You have to decide ??
what do you want to do?
Are you going to give up
33 1/3% of your company?
That's one?third.
Or not?
He's not flexible.
Are you?
It's called "the Shark Tank"
for a reason.
What do you want to do?
To me, the natural next step
is to partner with you.
So, I'd absolutely love
to take your offer.
Done! Great.
?Wow.
?Wow.
Perfect. Thank you!
Thank you so much.
I appreciate it.
Cheers.
Thank you.
Thank you!
You guys, thank you
very much.
Congratulations.
