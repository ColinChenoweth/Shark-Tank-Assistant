Winowich: Hi, Sharks.
My name is Princess
Michelle Winowich
from Bloomfield Hills, Michigan.
I am the prouder founder
of G. O. A. T. Pet Products.
We're here today seeking
a G. O. A. T partner
to invest $499,000
in exchange for 9%?equity
in our company.
[ Laughter ]
Whew.
Pet lovers have
all shared the dream
of wishing their
pets could talk,
just like in fairy tales.
Now, what if I told you
that I have the power
to give your pet a voice?
Meet Axel, a retired canine
hero that can speak.
Isn't that right, Axel?
Axel: That's right,
Princess Michelle!
Canine Axel, reporting for duty!
What?
Sharks, I'm not
really a princess,
and Axel here isn't really
a magical talking dog.
He's the proud owner
of our G. O. A. T.
Pet Speaker, and our
one?of?a?kind app
that gives you the ability
to interact with your pet
like never before.
Axel: You're so right,
Michelle.
But in addition to
giving me a voice,
the G. O. A. T. Pet Speaker
does so much more, like ??
I'll take it from here,
Axel, but thank you.
Not only does the G. O. A. T. Pet
Speaker give your pet a voice,
you can also stream your
favorite tunes out on walks.
What?
? So dream on,
dream on, dream on ?
Or to help relieve pet anxiety,
you can stream calming,
soothing classical music.

And with a built?in selfie
remote button,
right on the bottom
of the speaker,
now you can be in the picture
with your best friend.
Say "cheese."
[ Camera shutter clicks ]
As you can see, Sharks, G. O. A. T.
Pet Products is on track
to be the greatest of all time
in the pet industry,
but I'm here because
I need your partnership
to make my fairy tale a reality.
Michelle, before
I figure out
if you're on a sabbatical
from Bellevue,
why are you dressed
like Snow White?
Snow White always
talked to animals,
and they never had
the ability to talk back.
Have you talked to Snow White,
or the animals to find that out?
It's in the fairy tale.
It's in the fairy tale.
In the fairy tale.
O'Leary:
Michelle, is there a reason
you would have spent time
making this product?
What made you want to do it?
So, can I pass out some samples?
Can I have you take
a look at it?
Wow, what a beautiful dog.
Fairy tale packaging.
Thank you.
It's ?? I did bring an extra
treat for Mr. Wonderful.
?Do I get the apple, too?
?Poisoned apple?
He's not going to
rip us to shreds
if we don't do
a deal, is he?
Well, we do have
a secret command for that.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Greiner: They're very
cute?looking.
I'm still not quite sure
what they do ??
Okay.
But they look cute.
So, basically, the app
lets me record things
that I want my dog
to say to me?
Correct.
So, I could create
a dialogue??
I love you, Kevin.
No, it could be "Pick it
up yourself", or it could be,
"I'm going to pee
on the fire hydrant now".
Well, Michelle, you have
a $5,000,000?valuation.
No problem there,
Robert.
No, no, no.
This thing
makes dogs talk.
"That's cheap, Robert".
Obviously, if you have
a $5,000,000?valuation ??
Mm?hmm?
You sold a lot of
talking dog units.
The G. O. A. T.
Pet Speaker.
Why G. O. A. T.?
Greatest Of All Time.
And your sales are?
We've had over $2,000,000 in
sales in less than six months.
?What?
?What?!
You sold $2,000,000
of this crap?
?This is incredible!
?Don't say "crap"!
You look amazing
in that outfit now.
Thank you.
How?!
My experience is from
the pet industry.
I've launched many brands,
as a brand manager,
as a national sales manager.
I had a great job,
making $100,000 a year,
and full of ideas
for new products,
but I came home one night
and I told my husband
about this idea
that I was going to tell my boss
the next day, and he was like,
"Why do we keep paying
for everybody else's kids
to go to college?"
Like, "Just save these ideas,
like stop".
And so, I did, and a family
friend offered to partner,
basically, as an investor,
so I immediately
put in my notice,
I quit my job ??
?Wait a minute.
I'm curious, like ??
I don't think I understand
why it was such a big hit.
Winowich: When I went to Global
Pet Expo to launch this,
people literally, without
exaggerating,
were lining up to see.
I've been to these
trade shows ??
Did you get
orders there?
I did. I wrote more orders
than I have in 10 years
on my first day.
Okay. Okay. And then you
fulfilled those orders ??
No.
No?
Because ?? Because then,
I saw PetSmart.
And they said that they were
extremely interested,
but they like exclusivity.
How long were they going
to be exclusive?
Six months.
Did you give
them that?
Yes.
?What did they buy?
How much did they buy?
They bought over
$2,000,000?worth.
Wow.
It's incredible.
Is it $2,000,000 that is going
to hit the store,
and then you're going
to see the sell?through,
but that's
the initial order?
Correct.
We don't know if they're
going to sell?through.
?Do you have to take returns?
?There is no returns.
They can't return anything?
No, that was part of
the negotiations
for me to give up
exclusivity.
Okay, how much are they?
What do you sell these for?
$24.99.
$24.99, right.
Your cost?to?make is...
Um, my cost?to?make is
under $5, and that's ??.
Landed?
Landed costs, including
packaging, everything.
Okay.
So, how much money did you raise
from your silent partner?
To date, $260,000.
And how much equity
did he get for that?
50%.
?Ooh.
?50%?
50?
Yes, but
I needed a million dollars
in inventory, quick.
Alright. Look, it's the scariest
place, where you are right now.
If it doesn't start selling
right away at
this price point ??
Right.
You are screwed.
But I'm not,
and I'll tell you why.
Because ??
She's getting paid.
But that's no good.
You'll never sell again.
No.
Whatever it is that I needed
to support it, I would.
And I'm educating all
the store managers ??
I'm an investor.
You're asking me to value
you at $5,500,000
and give you $499,000.
And I have no data as to whether
or not this will sell.
I just ?? and you can't
give it to me.
I'm trying to figure out how to
invest in something like this
with a pragmatic,
financial discipline,
because you're not
worth $5,500,000
until you can show me
it sells through,
and they give you three
more orders like that,
and maybe that'll happen.
But there's no way for me
to find out.
There's no way to structure
a deal that makes sense.
They're putting huge
support behind it,
because they're backing it.
No, you're mistaken.
I think you're ??
you??you're missing his point.
With your orders that you're
creating with 200,000 units,
you're creating $1,000,000
in gross margin dollars ??
right? ??
for this one sale,
which is great, right?
Right.
But you're valuing the company
as if that's going to be
repeating on an
ongoing basis, right?
Yes.
And that's what
we don't know yet.
But here's the other part.
I hate the pet industry.
I don't have a feel for
what's going to last,
and what's not
going to last.
I just don't get
that industry.
For those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay, then.
Let me just say, "I'm out".
Michelle, I am shocked that
they gave an order that big
because it's an enormous risk
for them on something
that is not tested or proved.
This is not something
that I could invest in,
and at that valuation,
it's even further beyond.
I'm sorry.
I'm out.
Okay, now, you created this
company for what reason?
Because you were tired of
making everybody else rich.
You gave away 50% of your
company at a very early stage.
That means, for me
to give you anything,
I'm going to have to give you
a very aggressive offer,
which I'm not
ready to do,
because I don't
want you to go back
to the situation that
you left, so I'm out.
Thank you.
Robert, what are you
going to do?
Well, there's only
one shark left.
And it's you.
In nine years, I've patted dogs,
I've eaten dog food.
I've watched every time.
I've licked cats,
I even dropped a dog once,
but you've done something
no one's ever done
that's come out here, you got
a single order for $2,000,000.
It's incredible.
We don't really know
where it's going to go,
but I love it,
and I love this industry.
And?
I'm going to make you
an aggressive offer.
Narrator: Four Sharks are out,
but Robert seems interested
in Michelle's pet speaker
company, G. O. A. T.
Herjavec: We don't really know
where it's going to go,
but I love it,
and I love this industry.
And?
I'm going to make you
an aggressive offer.
I'll give you the $499,000
for one?third.
I understand you have orders,
and they're fantastic.
But we don't really know
if it's going to sell through.
So, you were at 9%.
Correct.
And he wants 33%.
Correct.
So, obviously, I came here
to negotiate, not just to be ??
I?I don't want
to negotiate.
I don't want to waste your time,
because I know you have
to go back to the dwarves.
You can choose
to accept it, or not.
So, you're not open
to negotiations?
You wouldn't consider 20%?
No.
It's ?? It's one?third.
$499,000 for 33%.
For 33%.
One?third.
"One?third".
I just want to negotiate.
You're not letting me.
So, you wouldn't
consider not even 25%?
You know, Michelle,
you could counter.
I?I'm going to say "No".
I'm going to tell you
that right now.
$500,000 is a lot
of money.
Mm?hmm.
And so, I want to have
the level of risk...
Sure.
...that I feel comfortable
with that at best.
Sure. Direct sales ??
I'm not going
to change my offer.
We have a profit
margin of 89%.
?The real question is ??
?Okay.
Michelle,
you asked for $499,000.
That's a lot of money.
You have to decide ??
what do you want to do?
Are you going to give up
33 1/3% of your company?
That's one?third.
Or not?
He's not flexible.
Are you?
It's called "the Shark Tank"
for a reason.
What do you want to do?
To me, the natural next step
is to partner with you.
So, I'd absolutely love
to take your offer.
Done! Great.
?Wow.
?Wow.
Perfect. Thank you!
Thank you so much.
I appreciate it.
Cheers.
Thank you.
Thank you!
You guys, thank you
very much.
Congratulations.
It's a lot of late nights
and some all?nighters,
and it's ?? it was to get me
to this point,
to be able to say
that Robert is my partner,
so it is beyond
a dream come true.
Robert, if it's a bust you'll
never get your $499,000 back.
Ever.
Herjavec:
We'll find out,
and I think that dog
wanted to eat you.
I programmed it.
Right now,
it's swearing
at her out there
for selling a third
of the company.
[ Laughs ]
Narrator: Next into the tank
is a way to look presentable
and comfortable.
