Hi, Sharks.
My name's Howie Busch,
Greiner:
So, Howie, I'm curious ??
what's your background,
Alright, it's a hell
of a story, Howie, okay?
Thank you.
But at the end
of the day,
you're in the
fleecewear business,
Howie, when you look at it,
it looks like sweatshirt ??
pull?over sweatshirt ??
with sweatpants.
Right. Right.
It's like, if I want the same
thing, I just go to Target
Howie, just out
of interest,
what does your wife
think of this idea?
She ??
She actually loves it.
Then I'm going
the other way. I'm out.
[ Laughter ]
The thing for me,
where I'm hung up here ??
besides the fact
that it looks to me
like stuff
you could get anywhere,
I find guys are usually
really hot all the time,
Howie, I respect that you've
taken something out there.
You're farther ahead than
most people watching at home.
?All the best, Howie.
?Thank you.
Busch:
I think they missed out on it.
I guess they didn't really get
where we were going with it.
