Hi, Sharks.
My name's Howie Busch,
and I'm from Long Island,
New York.
I'm seeking $150,000 in exchange
for 18% of my company,
DudeRobe.
Sharks, I have
a confession to make.
I'm not a robe guy.
Never have been.
That's because robes
for guys kind of suck.
For one, I just wouldn't want
anyone to see me like this.
Whether you're answering
the front door,
getting the morning paper,
or going to the supermarket,
it's just kind of creepy.
The second problem with robes?
Imagine you go to sign
for room service at the hotel,
and all of a sudden
your privates are now public.
Not exactly the kind of public
offer you had in mind,
huh, Kevin?
In over 200 years, men's robes
have barely changed at all,
so I redesigned and
re?engineered the bath robe
into something guys today
would actually want to wear.
Introducing DudeRobe,
the most badass robe?and?lounge
wear you have ever seen.
DudeRobe is a
mix?and?match collection
of four dude?friendly pieces.
There's the robe, the hoodie,
pants, and shorts.
Each piece contains comfy
and absorbent towel lining
on the inside, to soak up
wet and sweat,
and premium sweatcher
material on the outside,
to give it that
streetwear vibe.
It's loungewear you can
even wear out of the house,
and instantly go from
"creep" to "chic".
[ Laughter ]
It's perfect for
after the shower,
after the beach, after working
out, after shooting hoops,
or just hanging out
on a regular Sunday.
DudeRobe's got you
covered everywhere.
Look, there are two kinds
of guys in the world ??
guys who wear robes,
and guys who wouldn't
be caught dead in them.
DudeRobes are
actually for both.
Now, which one of you Sharks
wants to step out of the tank,
and into something
way more comfortable?
My butler, Jeeves, over here
has some samples to hand out,
so you can see and feel
why DudeRobe
is the only robe
a dude should ever wear.
So, we only have four.
There's one of each piece,
so if you guys can share
that would be great.
John: Why do you have
only four pieces?
Just curious.
In terms of having samples,
I launched three months ago.
I did a Kickstarter campaign.
There have definitely been
some manufacturing issues
that I'm working out.
Greiner:
So, Howie, I'm curious ??
what's your background,
and how did you get to
DudeRobe becoming your life?
So, my first year
of law school
I started negotiating
NFL contracts,
and during law school,
I, you know,
was building an agency.
So, in 1996 or '7,
I get a call from a guy
who was working out of
his grandmother's basement,
and he asked me if I could do
a contract for him and I said,
"Sure, no problem",
and negotiated the deal,
and he said,
"You know,
I could pay you
the few thousand dollars
that I owe you,
but cash is kind of tight,
would you be willing
to take some equity?"
My son had just been born.
My wife said, "Listen,
we need the money.
You don't know where this
company is going to end up",
and that was Under Armour,
and it was Kevin Plank
who called me.
Oh, wow.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Really?
Yep.
Did you take the equity
from Kevin?
Uh, no, I did not.
[ All groaning ]
I'm just wondering, what's
that equity worth today
that you didn't take?
Probably about
$250,000,000 or so?
?Oh, my God.
?Yippie?ki?yay.
[ Laughs ]
Alright, it's a hell
of a story, Howie, okay?
Thank you.
But at the end
of the day,
you're in the
fleecewear business,
and that's a very
competitive space,
and you've kind of combined
a bunch of elements
into DudeRobe.
I'm not saying it
doesn't have merit,
but I'm thinking to myself,
if I want any of this stuff,
how are you going to get to me,
what's the plan to market it?
You understand these
problems, because...
Sure.
...you're in the most
competitive
clothing category
there is.
The thing is,
looking at you,
it looks like, you know, just
shorts and a hoodie.
You could get those ??
?Nooo.
Well, you can, but these
are lined with towel,
and that's ?? and that's
the thing about them.
I work out.
?So the only difference is,
it's lined with fleece?
That's a distinction
without a difference.
Let me back up a little,
and let me tell you
what I've done with it, so far.
I've launched the Kickstarter
in June, okay?
So, I was asking for $25,000.
We ended up doing
just over $65,000.
What sold the most?
I offered a full set.
That sold the most,
which shocked me.
This ?? this
outfit here?
The full set.
The full set.
O'Leary: And what
did you sell it for?
The full set
was $219.
Oh!
You sell that for $219?
The ?? I mean, there are robes
that sell for $100
to, I just saw
one for $220.
Howie, when you look at it,
it looks like sweatshirt ??
pull?over sweatshirt ??
with sweatpants.
Right. Right.
It's like, if I want the same
thing, I just go to Target
and pick up a pull?over
sweatshirt.
Right. Right, but ??
The quality's nice, but there's
no way for anyone to know
until they get
their hands on it.
So, for those reasons
I'm out.
Okay.
Fair enough.
Howie, just out
of interest,
what does your wife
think of this idea?
She ??
She actually loves it.
Then I'm going
the other way. I'm out.
[ Laughter ]
The thing for me,
where I'm hung up here ??
besides the fact
that it looks to me
like stuff
you could get anywhere,
I find guys are usually
really hot all the time,
so you put on something
like this, and it's heavy,
and I feel like it
should be lightweight,
as opposed to heavyweight,
and for those reasons, I'm out.
Thank you.
Howie, I respect that you've
taken something out there.
You're farther ahead than
most people watching at home.
I've invested in stuff
I don't understand,
and done really well
with it.
This one ??
I don't understand.
You don't? Okay.
I don't get the butler.
I don't get the robe.
It looks like
a sweatshirt.
Like, what you're
wearing.
Yeah?
It looks like something every
guy wears on a Saturday ??
Intentionally.
Intentionally.
No, I got it, but I don't get
where you're going with it.
I'm out.
Daymond, you should be
all over this.
This is your space.
John:
One place in goods you never
want to be in the middle.
You want to be in the high?end,
you want to be in the low?end.
Sleepwear, generally ??
you want to go and buy
your Versace, Gucci.
If not, you're going
to go to places
like Burlington
and T. J. Maxx.
This is in the middle,
and you never want
to become pressed
in the middle,
so I just think that this is
going to be a challenge for you,
and I'm out.
?All the best, Howie.
?Thank you.
?And good luck, Howie.
?Thank you.
Busch:
I think they missed out on it.
I guess they didn't really get
where we were going with it.
Hopefully, they'll
look back and say,
"We missed out on this one",
just like I missed out
on Under Armour, you know.
That's how it goes.
