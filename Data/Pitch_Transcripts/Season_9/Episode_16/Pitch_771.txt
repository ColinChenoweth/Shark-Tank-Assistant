and Chris Sacca
for brightwheel,
an online platform that
helps early educators
connect with families.
Let's see how they're doing now.
Vasen: Before "Shark Tank",
brightwheel was being used
in 2,500 schools in the U. S.
After "Shark Tank", it's more
than 25,000 across the globe.
Brightwheel is the all?in?one
solution for early education,
so schools can manage everything
from staff to their billing,
and parents can actually
stay connected
to their kids
throughout the day.
We launched the free app
to prove the concept.
Now, we launched
a brand?new version
called brightwheel premium,
adding things like
staff management,
two?way messaging,
and parents are able to sign in
from their own phone.
Today, Mark and Chris
are joining me
for a really important meeting
with the Learning Care Group,
the second largest for?profit
childcare provider
in North America.
They have been testing out
the premium version
of brightwheel
in one of their schools.
Our families are
absolutely loving it,
so we're prepared
to roll with you guys
on a three?year,
million?plus deal.
Learning Care Group
offered a multi?year deal
to all 100 centers,
20,000 teachers, hundreds
of thousands of parents,
and they want
to do it right away.
When I came in to "Shark Tank",
our company had zero revenue,
and in just a few months since
launching brightwheel premium,
we now booked over $2,000,000
in sales for this year.
Seeing it here in the flesh,
seeing the money behind
a deal like this ??
it's all coming true.
Sacca: When you think about
how brightwheel
has revolutionized
the way schools do business,
and the way teachers
interact with parents,
there's really no limit
to how big this can get.
And I'm convinced this might be
one of the biggest deals
"Shark Tank" has ever seen.
Let's shoot
a brightwheel video.
That's such good idea.
Yeah, let's do it.
I'm a Shark, but I'm also a dad,
and I know how important
early education is.
Now with brightwheel, we can
impact the early education
of tens of millions of children
across this country.
That's incredible,
and, you know,
that's the beauty of
"Shark Tank".
Brightwheel!
Narrator:
Next up is a product that
gives voice to the voiceless.
Yo, Sharks.
I'm Lindsay Barto,
a.k.a.
El Moreno.
And I'm Chris Healy,
better known as El Rubio.
We're from San Diego,
California.
We're seeking $95,000
in exchange
for a 10% equity stake
in our business,
The Longhairs, a men's
grooming?and?lifestyle brand
and global fraternity
for men with long hair.
Kevin's out.
Do you know
what Genghis Khan??
I may grow my hair
back for this deal.
Do you know what Genghis Khan,
Louis XIV,
and Benjamin Franklin
all had in common?
They were longhairs.
In fact,
45 of the 53 framers of
the Constitution had long hair,
and the ones who
didn't wore a wig,
so people thought
they did.
You know who else was born
to be a longhair?
[ Laughter ]
Now Lori, I know we all can't
have as perfect hair as you,
but you know what?
We sure can try.
Healy: So, Sharks, if you
could be so kind
as to place the wig
upon your skull,
adjust it accordingly.
Mr. Wonderful, to take you back
to those glory days.
Oh, yeah.
[ Laughter ]
Yes. Mark, just
looking fantastic.
?There it goes.
?Feels normal.
?Guys, alright.
?Phenomenal.
Now that we are all feeling
the flow, let us tell you
a little bit about
our flagship product.
So Sharks, have you ever asked
a man for a hair tie?
No.
You know why?
Because it wasn't cool,
until now.
Now you can get hair ties
for guys...
and guess what?
Now it is cool.
Hair Ties for Guys
are freaking awesome,
so tie it up with pirates,
the American flag,
and lightning bolts, which show
that you mean business.
They tell you my hair ties are
as epic as these flowing manes.
?Yeah!
?Yeah!
That's right, Sharks.
We are The Longhairs,
and we advocate, educate,
and celebrate
men's long manes
with hair whips and high?fives,
and we are looking
for the right Shark
to invest in this untapped,
niche market that's about
to go supernova!
So, who's ready to ride
with The Longhairs,
and turn this flow
into dough?
Wow.
So, Sharks, please go ahead,
and open the boxes now.
You're going to find
our Hair Ties for Guys,
as well as a couple
of our other products.
This is what?
Hair serum.
A specially formulated
argan oil.
Shiny, plus a little
condition effect.
Robert, I see that it was
a little bit challenging
doing this for
your first time.
Are you saying you don't
like my man bun?
No, you look fantastic!
Look at that.
Oh, my God.
He looks like a freaking
Hamilton reject.
?That is phenomenal.
?Alright.
Are you selling
any of this stuff?
We are.
Well, let's talk
about that.
Alright, so year
one was last year.
We did $25,000
in sales.
Year to date, this year,
we're at $85,000.
?Whoa.
?Wow.
We're on pace
for $140,000.
Where are you
selling headbands?
We have two channels
right now ??
our website and Amazon,
and that's it.
So, it's all margin.
That's even better.
Yeah, oh, yeah.
What do you
sell it for?
What's your margin?
So, that collect??
the packs
you're holding there,
we're selling for $12.
You sell this for $12?!
Correct.
What does it cost
you to make?
$1.60.
And what's your
women's equivalent?
Ah, so there's a??
Really cheap.
Wide range ??
it goes from $2 for, like,
a pack of 100, really.
Why wouldn't I just, you know,
steal my wife's?
That's what we'd been doing,
and really,
we started growing
our hair out
for the first time,
and we started going
and buying hair ties at
the women's hair care aisle.
And we're figuring out,
okay, these are pink,
these are polka dot,
these are purple.
Like, I just want
black regular.
So you're saying the colors
aren't manly?
Right.
It's the colors,
but it's also
the conditioning...
Manly.
and what we actually
found out
through our product testing
and development
is we actually have come up
with a superior hair tie.
Why are they better?
The problem that we were
able to solve
in developing
these hair ties
is that brands were not
able to print robust,
creative designs on the
outside of the hair tie
without sacrificing
performance,
so we're able to use
a polyester?based elastic blend
that allowed us
to do a heat?transfer
so that we could print
all the designs that we wanted
without sacrificing
the performance,
and we've also used
this sleeve to cover the seam,
which allows us to individually
brand all the hair ties.
So, now that it's the best
hair tie in the world,
would women buy it?
Absolutely.
It's a fun
little business.
I give you guys credit, man,
and it's a good angle.
Is there anybody else
focused on guys with long hair?
There's really no one
speaking to
men with long hair
or certain??
Where'd you get that?
There's no one selling
specific products
to men with long hair.
Hey, Chris,
why did Mark get??
Is this from my hair?
Uh, we tried to dye your hair,
because it was ??
Now you tell me!
Come on, dude!
?Oh, my God!
?Why did you dye his hair?
Because it was actually
a red wig.
?Is it coming off right now?
?It's red, and you dyed it!
?I love it.
?Why did you do this?
This is what happens
when you dye your hair.
?Is it coming off on you?
?Wow!
?Okay, so ??
?Oh, my God!
How do you guys
get the word out now?
We have a podcast,
articles.
We have videos.
Cue it up.
This is El Rubio attempting
to break the most consecutive
hair whips in
the Grand Canyon.
[ Laughs ]
?Oh, my God.
?Chris, is that you?
Yeah.
How many did you do?
14 consecutive days.
?What?!
?14 consecutive days?
We wanted to beat
a world record.
John: In the Grand Canyon,
whipping your hair?
When ??
how many whips?
We weren't counting the actual,
individual whips.
It was the days in a row.
Okay. But how many
guys have hair
down to their shoulders
or longer?
So, what we know is
that we've captured
close to 5,000
customers so far.
We know we're getting 45,000
unique visitors every month.
O'Leary: Okay, guys ??
I like you and I like this.
Let me throw a deal out here
because I want to be
a part of this movement.
What?!
'Cause you guys make crazy
margins, so here's my offer.
I'm going to give you your
$95,000 for 10%.
However, if I've ever seen
a deal
that could support
a royalty, this is it.
So, here's how I get
my dough back,
because 10% is nothing.
You know what I mean?
So, I want two bucks off every
order until I get back $200,000,
which basically
doubles my money.
Ugh.
Then, it goes away ??
That's ??
And I keep my ??
Silence, please.
Then I keep my 10%
as your partner
to give me an incentive
to keep blowing up your website,
because when I get
behind this, guys with hair,
and even guys without hair, are
going to be ordering this thing.
Uh, Kevin,
that's a generous offer.
We appreciate it,
first of all...
Of course it is!
...that you would
believe in us ??
I totally
believe in you.
Having just met us
for a minute here.
We'd like to consider
a little bit further.
So, to me, looking at
what you're doing,
with those ties
and the headbands,
I'd be doing a lot of black,
I'd do skull?and?crossbones,
I would do things like that,
that are just
a little bit more edgy,
because I do feel that guys
are going to gravitate
to that more.
Lori, it's not
the Recommendation Tank.
You're recommending
them to death.
Are you going to
make an offer?
Are you investing?
I ?? No.
Well, there you have.
I did not see his ??
All that noise.
?We're listening, Lori.
?Lori, what's the word?
For me, I would be redesigning
everything that you had,
which, I'm sure,
that you don't want that.
I'm sorry.
I'm out.
And you are so rude!
So rude!
Okay, guys, before you get back
to the king of Propecia,
here's my thought ??
we all work here,
I believe, to have
a quality of life,
and I don't know
if you need my investment,
because if I call
you on the phone
and find out you've been
whipping your hair
in the Grand Canyon for 14 days,
we're going to have a problem.
[ Laughter ]
I don't want to destroy
your quality of life.
I'm out.
I like you, guys, right?
Because you know
what you're doing.
Yep.
Alright, so
I'll make you an offer.
I'll give you
$100,000 for 25%.
?Expensive.
?What?
Well, you realize, Kevin gave
you an offer a long time ago.
What was your offer,
Kevin?
Very, very
reasonable,
given that Mark's going to steal
a quarter of your business.
I said I'd give you the $95,000
you asked for.
I'll take the 10% equity
to get involved,
but I want $2 from every order
until I get back $200,000.
And that royalty goes away.
That's how I get
my capital back.
But then, we're still left with
our friendship and our hair,
but I only have 10% of
the company versus his 25%.
I like my deal
a lot better.
Lindsay, you got two
completely different offers.
They asked you ??
What do you guys
want to do?
You guys know I'm not
patient, right?
Mark, would you do it
for 15%, $100,000?
I'd do it for 20%.
Yes or no?
?Do the royalty deal.
?Kevin.
Barto:
Struck a deal with the big dog.
One guy we were really eyeing.
We thought
he would get it.
We're in business
with Mark Cuban.
Whoo!
Aw, dude.
