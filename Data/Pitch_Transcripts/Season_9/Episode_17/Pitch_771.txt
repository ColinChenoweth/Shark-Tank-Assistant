Hi, I'm Alice Rossiter,
Alice's Table empowers women
across the country
to launch
their own businesses,
teaching
flower?arranging classes.
There are brilliant moms
everywhere
Rossiter: Looking good
over there.
I got skills.
Awesome!
[ Laughs ]
So, if you want to take it
back to your seat.
All right. Perfect.
All I keep thinking is, uh,
that valuation
better be as beautiful
as this.
?So, Alice...
?Yes.
...what is this business
that you are presenting to us?
So, we built a platform
where we help women
launch their businesses.
So they buy into the system,
Blakely: So, Alice, I see
a hole in this
that I want to talk to you
about.
So, you're selling
tickets ??
they're coming to learn
how to arrange flowers.
Yep.
You don't have something next
to sell them, right?
Yep.
So once you've trained
these people
how to arrange flowers...
Yep.
...what do you ??
You have to keep on
finding new people ??
You got to keep finding ??
It's ?? it's
a really intense model
of having to always
find new people.
Right. Well, they do come back
multiple times, right?
So, we've seen
about 20% repeat.
Alice,
what are your sales?
Um, about $600,000.
Not your total.
Sorry. Our total ??
So, 30% of that.
?You make 30% ??
?Your net revenue will be...
?Yeah.
?...$180,000.
Yes.
So, let's make it $150,000
after tax.
Okay.
$250,000 for 6.25% ??
back of the envelope,
$4 million valuation.
You want me to pay 30 times
this year's profit
for a nonproprietary
flower?arranging club.
"Nonproprietary
flower?arranging club."
He already knows
the answer
before he asked the question.
?I don't ??
You really think this thing
is worth 4 million bucks?
We're gonna find out.
Look, I like it,
but the valuation's insane.
Alice, I have a lot of companies
over eight years...
?Yeah.
?...on "Shark Tank,"
?All right, you got an offer.
?Alice, everyone's gonna
have issue
with your valuation,
John: Alice,
we're going in a ??
into a time
when entrepreneurs
can do things like this
from home...
Alice,
who else could do $100,000
of flower?arranging
tickets?
I think that ??
I mean, I'm gonna give you
a huge compliment.
?Lots, lots of women.
?That's extraordinary.
Okay, Alice,
uh, let's get to ??
Alice, have you ever
heard of Wine ??
Alice has one offer on the table
from Kevin
for her business?in?a?box
platform, Alice's Table.
Mark is also interested,
but he doesn't like the amount
of equity that she's offering.
What I'd like to do
is offer 250K
for 10% plus the option
to buy more in your next round.
At the same valuation.
Whatever
that current valuation is.
Whatever ?? Okay.
But I'm gonna ask Sara
to come in for part of it.
Do you agree ??
working it that way?
Yes. I'll do that deal.
Because if you have somebody
who's walked the walk
?Alice!
?Congrats, Alice.
Alice,
it's over between us.
Oh, no!
[ Laughter ]
Bye! Thank you!
Awesome.
What Alice has done is create
a program
