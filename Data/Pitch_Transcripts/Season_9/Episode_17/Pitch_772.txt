Hi, I'm Alice Rossiter,
and I'm from
Boston, Massachusetts.
I'm the founder and CEO
of Alice's Table,
and my company
is seeking $250,000
for 6.25% equity.
Whoa.
Alice's Table empowers women
across the country
to launch
their own businesses,
teaching
flower?arranging classes.
There are brilliant moms
everywhere
looking for flexible
and creative ways to make money
and lead in their communities,
and millions of millennials
searching for side hustles.
So I can't wait to show you
what one of the classes is like.
So, Sara, will you join me
up here
for a flower?arranging
demonstration?
Sure.
Absolutely.
Come on up.
Each of you in front of you
have an apron and a full set up,
so feel free
to put your apron on.
?[ Laughs ]
?You, too.
Okay.
All right.
[ Laughs ]
This is what
they call an apron?
That's an apron, yeah.
[ Laughs ]
So, I've gone ahead
and greened your base,
which is the first set up.
?Okay.
?You also have cocktails
in front of you
because flowers
are always better
with a little bit of cocktail.
What are we drinking?
You're drinking
a Moscow Mule.
[ Laughter ]
Ooh!
'Cause why not?
So, 9:00 in the morning
while you're trimming
the flowers,
you're pounding back
the vodka.
Exactly!
We just keep it fun.
I got it.
So, the first step ??
we're gonna take
our hydrangeas,
grab both of them,
take your clippers,
and just give 'em
a cut at 45?degree angle...
Okay.
...and put 'em
into your arrangement.
Okay.
Yep, and now put them
into your vase.
Uh, into the vase
with greenery right there.
?This one?
?Yep.
Greiner: [ Laughs ] You would
think we've never seen a flower.
Could I take the thorns off Lori
with this?
No.
Could I take the thorns off him?
Rossiter: Go ahead and put five
of your roses into your vases.
?Okay.
?Also, you can blow on the roses
and blow them open
a little bit more.
Warm air
does open them up.
?Lori.
?Uh, yes, Kevin?
Blow on this.
[ Laughter ]
So, now if you want
to finish off
with your gerber daisies
and your calla lilies,
and some hypericum berry
if you would like to.
This is very therapeutic.
It's fun.
?Very nice.
?That looks good, Mark.
Rossiter: Looking good
over there.
I got skills.
Awesome!
[ Laughs ]
So, if you want to take it
back to your seat.
All right. Perfect.
All I keep thinking is, uh,
that valuation
better be as beautiful
as this.
?So, Alice...
?Yes.
...what is this business
that you are presenting to us?
So, we built a platform
where we help women
launch their businesses.
So they buy into the system,
and they buy in at $699,
and they get a kit
of materials.
So they get basically everything
you see here,
which is aprons, clippers,
rose strippers, buckets ??
all of that stuff.
And what's your cost
to put that together?
Our cost on that
is about $550.
Oh, wow. $550.
Just so I understand ??
They come to you,
they're doing it
at their home,
at a party space,
wherever they want to ??
Wherever they want. Yep.
But do they get
the flowers?
So, they get the flowers
per event.
So really what they're getting
with that is the box of stuff,
and then
they're getting training,
and it's developed
that way
because the vision
for the business
is that if we can build
a business in a box,
flowers is just one
of those iterations,
and then from there
it switches
to be
an event?management platform.
So, I just wrote you
a check for $699.
Yep.
What's my expectation?
You get a box of materials,
you get training,
and then you're launching
your classes.
So you're going out
and looking for venues,
you're looking for, um,
ways to sell tickets.
So you're gonna sell me
on starting another business
selling our experience
on cutting flowers and drinking.
Exactly.
Got it. But why flowers?
I started with flowers
because they can be done
anywhere, right?
So I could take
this arrangement class
to a bar?restaurant,
I could take it
to someone's home,
I could take it
to country club ??
Okay, th??
that makes sense.
And many people have bought
Alice's Table so far?
So, we have 53 Execs
right now.
"53 Execs" ??
That's what you call 'em.
Execs, yeah.
53 people have paid you
the $699?
Yes.
Do you make revenue
per tickets sold?
Yes.
So we take a 30% commission...
30%. Okay.
...on all tickets sold,
and tickets are $65.
Let me sum this up
from a consumer standpoint.
Yeah.
I always loved ??
It's so important
to think like a consumer.
So, if I'm the consumer,
what I'm getting
is a flower arrangement
for $65...
Yep.
...and a good time.
And a good time ??
that's what you get.
And I met other women
who are like?minded.
Yep. And now ??
And if I were to order
my own arrangement,
it's about $65 plus?
Exactly.
?Okay.
?I was actually Exec number one.
I did this for eight months
to try and see how it worked
and wanted to do it myself,
and actually I sold
over $100,000 of tickets.
?In what period of time?
?In what period of time?
It was about eight months.
In eight months.
That's good.
Wow.
You did a ?? I'm ??
And I'm just...
Yeah.
...blown away by that ??
you went around
selling tickets...
I did. Yes.
...to flower arranging,
and you made $100,000.
Now, has anybody else
emulated that?
We have one Exec that's doing
about 110 tickets a month,
so she's getting close.
John: Is there an average
of how much
an Exec can do
in a month?
The average right now ??
They're doing
17?and?a?half tickets a month.
Um...
And you're getting $30
from every ticket.
Yes. No, sorry. $19.
Blakely: So, Alice, I see
a hole in this
that I want to talk to you
about.
So, you're selling
tickets ??
they're coming to learn
how to arrange flowers.
Yep.
You don't have something next
to sell them, right?
Yep.
So once you've trained
these people
how to arrange flowers...
Yep.
...what do you ??
You have to keep on
finding new people ??
You got to keep finding ??
It's ?? it's
a really intense model
of having to always
find new people.
Right. Well, they do come back
multiple times, right?
So, we've seen
about 20% repeat.
Alice,
what are your sales?
Um, about $600,000.
Not your total.
Sorry. Our total ??
So, 30% of that.
?You make 30% ??
?Your net revenue will be...
?Yeah.
?...$180,000.
Yes.
So, let's make it $150,000
after tax.
Okay.
$250,000 for 6.25% ??
back of the envelope,
$4 million valuation.
You want me to pay 30 times
this year's profit
for a nonproprietary
flower?arranging club.
"Nonproprietary
flower?arranging club."
He already knows
the answer
before he asked the question.
?I don't ??
You really think this thing
is worth 4 million bucks?
We're gonna find out.
Look, I like it,
but the valuation's insane.
Alice, I have a lot of companies
over eight years...
?Yeah.
?...on "Shark Tank,"
and the truth is
that the majority of my returns
have come from ones
run by women,
so I love investing in strong,
smart, go?get?'em women.
You're one of those.
I hate your valuation,
I love your business, okay?
I'll give you the $250,000
for 25%,
which gives you
a "millski" valuation.
A whole millski!
A millski's
a good value for it.
?All right, you got an offer.
?Alice, everyone's gonna
have issue
with your valuation,
so can you take a moment
and justify it yourself?
Yeah, it's about
the top line revenue
is where we valued it
at 7x from that,
and then also I don't view this
as a flower company.
No, it's not.
I view it as a platform
with which we deliver
a business in a box,
and we can deliver
any business in a box ??
Right, so that's the key.
Right?
And that's ??
So, this is just your first,
um, proof of concept,
right, selling flowers?
Exactly.
You can go
in a hundred different ways.
You just want to plug in
as many businesses
to enable entrepreneurs.
Yep.
That's what this is about,
right?
?Totally. 100%.
?And how many different lines?
I can't say I have, like,
a five ??
you know, a five?product
line projection for that.
That's okay. You're gonna get
your ideas from your customers.
John: Alice,
we're going in a ??
into a time
when entrepreneurs
can do things like this
from home...
Yeah.
...and you can empower them,
and you want
to empower women,
so I love
that aspect of it.
But I also think
that there's a bad message
I would be sending to give you
a $4 million valuation
on what everyday Americans
are doing every two minutes.
Oh, come on, Daymond.
So I'm out.
Okay.
Let me ?? Let me try
to help him.
Can I ?? Wait, can I get
one thing clear about the ??
She's doing
the exact opposite.
She's saying anybody
could start a business for $700,
is what she's saying.
Yes.
One second ??
I love that
"Take control of your life,
start it right now.
Don't depend on anybody else.
$700." Great.
But the valuation
to give her that
with the proof of concept
that she has right now ??
to me, it's too much.
Okay.
Alice,
who else could do $100,000
of flower?arranging
tickets?
I think that ??
I mean, I'm gonna give you
a huge compliment.
?Lots, lots of women.
?That's extraordinary.
I think that there
are millions and millions
of women out there
that can do that.
Lots of ?? yeah.
Okay, Alice,
uh, let's get to ??
Alice, have you ever
heard of Wine ??
You ever heard
of Wine and Design?
?I have.
?That's a "Shark Tank" company.
Yes.
Instead of flowers,
it's wine and painting.
Join the O'Leary family
of strong executive women.
Mark,
what are you gonna do?
Forget about
any other offer.
I'm waiting for him
to shut up. Um...
Are you gonna make an offer,
or are you gonna pontificate?
Let's hear the offer.
[ Chuckles ]
Um, I love what you're doing.
I like the idea that you want
to go into multiple lines.
I don't like the idea
it's only 6.25%.
Alice has one offer on the table
from Kevin
for her business?in?a?box
platform, Alice's Table.
Mark is also interested,
but he doesn't like the amount
of equity that she's offering.
What I'd like to do
is offer 250K
for 10% plus the option
to buy more in your next round.
At the same valuation.
Whatever
that current valuation is.
Whatever ?? Okay.
But I'm gonna ask Sara
to come in for part of it.
Do you agree ??
working it that way?
Yes. I'll do that deal.
Because if you have somebody
who's walked the walk
and talked the talk,
it's gonna
accelerate things.
Yep.
The value
escalates dramatically.
So I want the option...
Yep.
...to raise an additional 10%
for Sara and I.
So if you raise it $8 million,
we'll pay the $8 million.
?Okay.
?If you raise it $10 million,
we'll pay the $10 million
so that when
we help you increase the value,
you benefit,
we benefit.
Yep.
In order for this to be
a $100 million company...
?Yes.
?...which I think it can be...
I agree.
...then you're gonna
have to raise more money,
because we want to go
nationally, global.
So to help get you started,
you're gonna have two really,
really good entrepreneurs,
great entrepreneurs...
?Yep.
...here to help you
brand and market it.
So you get
the best of both worlds...
Right. Yep.
...we get the value,
so all you have to do
is say "Yes."
Or you get Mr. Wonderful.
So, we're in this together?
We're in this together.
What do you say? You got
to give me an answer right now.
?Yes.
?Wait a sec??
?Ohh!
?[ Laughs ]
?I'm jumping on it.
?Wow.
?Congratulations.
?Got to give her a rose!
Exactly.
That's awesome.
I'm so excited.
We're gonna help
so many entrepreneurs together.
I can't wait.
I'm so excited.
?Yes. Wonderful.
?Thank you.
Thank you.
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
Thank you. Oh! Thank you!
Two roses!
?Bye!
?Thank you.
?Alice!
?Congrats, Alice.
Alice,
it's over between us.
Oh, no!
[ Laughter ]
Bye! Thank you!
Awesome.
I'm so excited
to have both Sara and Mark.
They were both the people
that I was hoping to work with,
and to have both of them
on my team
and helping me to help
future entrepreneurs
is just phenomenal.
What Alice has done is create
a program
that allows her
to go out there and say,
"For $700, if you're willing
to put in the work"...
Yep.
..."you can make
some money."
Why do you give her
such a high valuation?
When I said
this can be $100 million,
I wanted to see if she's ??
like, she was taken aback.
She wasn't.
I would've preferred
you stayed out of it, Mark.
Greiner: It was a good deal.
[ Laughter ]
Congratulations.
That's always the case
with Kevin.
