theme parks,
and cruise ships,
and virtually every water park
in the country.
We just launched our
newest product, the FlexSafe,
the soft/resistant
portable safe.
Would you two be interested
in renting an AquaVault today?
Now every beachfront hotel
in Miami Beach
rents AquaVaults
to their guests.
You put the code, you put it
on a chair, you're good to go.
Awesome.
Thank you.
When we pitched on "Shark Tank,"
we did $87,000 in sales.
Two?and?a?half years later,
we're now at $7 million
in sales.
Mr. Morales.
Hey, how are ya?
John: The guys have invited me
to join them
at a meeting
at City Hall today
to talk about how the product
has been performing
on the beach and helping
to keep the beach safe.
Your product's been out there
since 2015,
and over that 2?year period,
we've seen a real decrease
in the number of, uh,
thefts out on the beach.
Because of that,
we will be putting signs
up and down our seven miles
of beautiful beach
letting our visitors
and residents know
"Keep your stuff safe,"
uh, "and go use AquaVault."
Kinas: Beyond the
business aspect and the sales,
what really gets us moving
is that we're providing
a peace of mind
that never existed.
Now guests can actually
enjoy vacations
in a way
they never had before.
John: The future for AquaVault
is to replicate this magic
all around the world.
It's not just about money
and a product ??
they're helping keep
the beaches safe.
I'm really proud of the guys.
This is way more than business,
and I couldn't be more honored
to be a part of it.
I'm Nick Kierpiec.
And I'm Scott Parks.
We're from
Williamsburg, Virginia,
and our company is ZUP.
ZUP!
We're seeking
a $300,000 investment
in exchange for
a 10% equity stake
in our business.
Everybody loves a day
out on the water,
but water skiing
and wakeboarding
can be a little intimidating
to learn.
With ZUP boards,
you can ride with confidence,
whether it's your first time
or your 40th time.
With our new innovation,
we'll have you ZUP
and smiling
first pull, every pull.
If you look at the video,
each board is deigned
to meet your level of comfort
with two foot straps,
two side handles,
and a double ZUP tow rope.
So you can start off lying down
like on a boogie board,
easily pull yourself up
to a knee board position,
then, when you're ready,
you can stand up.
If Grandpa can do it,
everybody can do it.
[ Chuckles ]
So, this is
the easiest board
you'll ever tow
behind your boat,
Jet Ski, pontoon,
whatever.
So you just start
by laying on it.
It's easy.
It's stable,
and you can climb all over it.
Get on your knees,
go like this,
cross the wake,
the handle stays on magically ??
then if you're ready,
you want to go
to the next position,
pull the handle
towards you.
Now we can stand up
to water skiing on one board.
Now I'm gonna drop
the handle down.
What just happened?
My fingers did not get anywhere
near a pinch point.
I have four daughters,
and I always freaked out
when they were about
to put the handle back,
thinking "Don't pinch
your fingers!"
So we created this,
patented it ??
this is super safe.
So now I'm tired.
I'm gonna take a break.
We really do this
all the time.
[ Laughs ]
So, guys, that's ZUP,
and at this time,
we'd love
to take your questions.
What are your sales?
Kierpiec: So, since we started
our business,
in four years, we've done
$2.5 million in sales.
How 'bout this year?
This year we have
a sales goal of $1 million.
We're actually on track
to do better than that.
Greiner: And where are you
selling?
So, we sell all across
the country.
We have 180 retailers
in the Untied States.
We also have retailers
in Canada, the U. K.,
Japan, Australia.
Do you sell online?
We do sell online.
We sell direct to consumer
through our website
and through other channels.
And who's your biggest
direct?to?consumer outlet?
Is it your website
or Amazon or ??
It would definitely be
Amazon.
?Amazon. Yeah.
?Amazon?
Well, how much
do you sell it for?
Our highest?price board is
the one you see in the middle,
and that's the DoMore Board.
That's priced at $429.
And our best?selling board
is the YouGotThis Board,
and that's priced at $279.
And then our lowest?priced
is the YouGo Board,
and that's priced at $219.
And what does it cost you
to make 'em?
Our average margin
across all products is 54%.
So, guys,
I am really interested
in the product
differentiation ??
why you're different
and unique
in comparison
to the competition.
Right. So, I understand
your background,
and being
an industry disrupter yourself,
we ended up doing that
in this industry accidentally.
We were ignorant of the fact
that we couldn't do it,
and we ended up doing it.
As a designer for 30 years,
I'm constantly
innovating ideas.
And basically,
I have four daughters,
[Voice breaking]
and my wife said, you know,
[Normal voice] "Our kids
are getting a little older,
and they're not gonna
want to hang out with us
when they're teenagers.
We need to get a boat."
[ Laughter ]
She goes, "Yeah!
Boats are magnets.
They'll bring their friends,
they'll hang out with us,
and every day
we're having a blast.
Tell us
about your patent.
We have three current utility
patents that are granted.
Three, and ??
They're granted.
Yes.
Tell me about them.
Basically, we have
a system of riding
that builds confidence
in the kids.
As you see, everybody
on the boat is gonna be happy,
but the way
it builds confidence
is you're not having
to be pulled up out of the water
and squirreling around until
you figure out how to do it.
So, it might take 15 times
to pull somebody up.
Boat drivers are awesome.
They have such a heart
to teach somebody.
Wait. You know what?
I'm confused.
Okay. I'm ??
I'm sorry. Respectfully...
?It's all right.
?Sure.
I don't understand what that
has to do with the patent.
Lori and I are basically
asking the same question.
?Yes. Okay.
?Tell us the specific things
on your board
that are unique to you
that does not exist
on other boards.
So, the foot straps
are actually patented.
What those do is they're
actually multi?use foot straps.
We use them as elbow pads,
we use them as knee pads,
and we use them
as foot straps.
Well, there are foot pads
on wakeboards.
?Right.
?Yes, so ??
Duff: Yes, but you don't use 'em
for all three things.
Okay.
It's actually
the combination of the tow hook,
two side handles,
and the foot straps
is what our patent
is based off of for the board.
So you have to have
all three things on the board,
and that makes it unique?
?Right.
?It's unique process of riding.
?Somebody else can't do that.
?Right.
?Right.
With this board
and this combination,
it is the perfect scenario.
It is the perfect way
to get ??
Then why haven't
you sold more?
Well,
we industry disrupted,
so it's a little hard
for ??
You industry disrupted
four years ago, though.
Blakely: I want to jump in
for a second and help you guys
because I like you guys, okay?
?Sorry, Sara. Keep going.
So, when you come out
and you present a product,
you should always start
with the problem,
then why the other solutions
are flawed...
Duff: Okay.
...and then what
you're offering
and why it's different.
Is the problem because
a lot of people can't get up,
or are they getting hurt?
I'm a little touchy?feely,
so when I tell the story,
be prepared.
Okay. Glen, Glen, please give
a direct answer.
We've got
that you're very emotional...
?No, but the problem ??
?...you care about this,
you love this ??
Greiner: Yeah. Okay.
She asked for the problem,
I'm gonna tell her the problem.
The problem was we would bring
a bunch of kids out
after church on the water,
and we wanted them
to be successful.
Right.
And they couldn't ride
anything.
Okay. That's good.
I'm getting the problem.
We felt terrible,
so we sat down,
we flipped over our napkins,
started drawing some ideas,
went straight to the garage,
grabbed a piece of wood,
cut it out.
In 10 minutes,
we're on the water.
We failed.
The next day
we did it again.
The third day
we're like, "Whoa."
The people at the marina
that thought we were crazy
are going, "Wow."
Now, fast forward,
we've put this on the boat ??
This is what they want to ride
all the time.
So, Glen,
why haven't you sold more?
Guys, I've never heard
a disrupter call themselves
or their products or their
services "disruptive," right?
Disrupters go and disrupt,
and the market tells them
they're disruptive.
And I think he has been called
a "Disrupter,"
and that's why
he's saying that.
Well, but ??
but the point is it's ??
it's more of the deflection
rather than an answer.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Okay. I can't even see us
having a conversation.
I'm out.
Th?Thank you,
Daymond.
We appreciate that.
Thank you.
?All right. But, you guys,
I want to go back
to the product itself.
Sure.
Is there competition?
Parks: So, there have been
knock?offs.
Um, there was one
in particular
that we believe
seriously violated our claims,
but it's a large brand
who wanted
to seize the opportunity,
so we actually
have found lawyers
on 100% contingency...
That's lucky.
...pursing that litigation
so that we can focus
on the business
'cause, honestly,
we are not interested
in litigating.
I want to go back
to what matters ?? the numbers.
?Yes.
?The numbers.
The last number ??
Excuse me, Lori.
This ?? this matters.
All right, and before he goes
to the numbers,
I want to finish
on the patent thing,
'cause I don't want
to beat a dead horse.
Enough with the patent.
If they have no sales,
who gives a ??
No, I have one last question
that matters.
Yes?
So you got
into litigation.
Correct.
Did you win?
Uh, there was
a summary judgment issued.
Uh ??
?What was the decision?
It was not in our favor.
You don't think
that was relevant?
No, it ?? it was.
I was trying to talk, and ??
?Right.
?So, unfortunately,
you have to continue on
with your ??
?We do, but ?? but ??
?Fortunately, we'll continue
in front
of three patent judges,
not a local guy
that doesn't know patent law.
I understand
your patent issues.
Yeah.
I understand
the litigation.
I want to ask you
about the numbers.
Okay.
You told me you were gonna do
a million in sales.
Yes, sir.
Okay.
What are you gonna make
on that million this year?
If we had
a?a million dollars in sales,
we will likely, uh,
net $200,000 in net profit.
20%
without paying yourselves.
Without paying ourselves.
Okay,
do you have any debt?
We do have debt.
Again, uh ??
How much debt
do you have?
$550,000 in debt.
?Whoa!
?Ohh.
But collateralized
by inventory.
?High inventory.
?We have a lot of inventory.
This year's supposed
to be a windfall.
It really is a turning point
for the business.
How much cash in the bank
do you have?
$100,000 in the bank
right now.
We've got $200,000 in ??
in receivables.
Yeah, over $200,000.
Hey, guys ?? Guys, I got
to tell you something.
If you don't have a good season,
you're going to zero.
You know that?
The story's not pretty.
It's getting a little uglier
the more I ask
about the balance sheet,
okay?
I did two seconds worth
of analysis ??
You have to monetize
your inventory, like, now.
Which is what is
happening right now.
Well, I hope so, but you are
a 50?50 chance away from zero.
I'm out.
We loved being able
to present to you.
Thank you.
Guys, when I look
to invest ??
It's like a poker game,
right?
I'm either all in
or I fold.
I'm looking at
what you guys have.
There are some problems.
It's really iffy.
If I can't be all in,
I have to fold.
So I'm sorry, I'm out.
Aw.
So, does any other board
have the hook
where the handle goes
on it?
Other boards do have hooks,
but they have recessing hooks,
and part of the system
that makes this so great ??
When that hook recesses,
you have to push down
to get it to pop back up,
which many people don't do.
So, you know what I would've
loved to have seen?
Yes?
'Cause that's a big,
important point of difference ??
probably the biggest
point of difference ??
I wouldn't have spent too
much time on the knee pads.
I would have shown
the other product
and pinched my fingers
in front of us and said...
Right.
..."This is the problem."
Yeah.
You said you have
four daughters.
?Yeah.
?That was your biggest concern.
Well, I don't want
to be negative.
?No.
?Listen, you have to be willing
to point out the difference
on why you're better.
You're taking
your own sweat equity.
That's not about
being negative.
Okay.
It's not about
going negative.
It's about being factual.
You're asking us
to invest money in you.
I have to feel comfortable.
You shouldn't feel
bad about that.
I think you guys need
a little bit of work
on your marketing message,
starting with why, and that's
gonna be your biggest asset,
but for that reason,
I'm out.
Well said.
Thank you, guys.
Wow.
Wow.
?Well ??
?Hang in, you guys.
?Expect ??
?Good luck, you guys.
?Guys, thank you very much.
?Expect some orders from me,
'cause I'm ordering
those boards.
Thank you very much.
We appreciate it.
?They are ??
?You know what?
Great product,
horrible management.
?They are dead and walking.
?Horrible management.
?Horrible management.
?That is going to zero.
Hoo!
Wish we'd have gotten
that deal.
Ahh!
Dream came true, though,
getting this far.
A really awesome
opportunity.
You know, the business
has got some challenges,
but we're gonna make
this successful,
and people out on the boat are
gonna love it no matter what.
Mm?hmm.
