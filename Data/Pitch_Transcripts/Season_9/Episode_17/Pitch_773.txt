Hello, Sharks.
My name is Wendy Colson,
Cuban: Thank you, Wendy.
Blakely: So, these are three
different flavors?
?Three different flavors.
?Okay.
Wendy, what's your
top?selling flavor?
Colson: Oatmeal chocolate chip.
John: It's good, actually.
?Thank you!
?It is good.
Colson: There's a gluten?free
peanut butter.
Greiner: Ooh, I like
the peanut butter one.
Colson: All right, let me ??
let me first ??
Wendy, I'm struggling
because I love the mission
behind what you're doing.
Where I'm getting caught up
is on the proven results.
Like, that matters so deeply
to me for the consumer.
The moms come back ??
they buy.
but why would they buy...
?Wendy, good news.
Okay, Wendy, you have
two offers ??
both $150,000 for 20%.
What are you going to do?
They're both amazing offers.
That's what makes
this so difficult.
I... [ Sighs ]
But you have to make
a decision.
I know, I know.
Do you go with the guy
who's currently going through
the same situation
that those mothers
will be going through,
or do you go with somebody who
is going through male menopause?
You have to make
a decision.
Colson:
I mean, that was so hard.
I am just so excited,
because I?I couldn't ask
for a better Shark.
