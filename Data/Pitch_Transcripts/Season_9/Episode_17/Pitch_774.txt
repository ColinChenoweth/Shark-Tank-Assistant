Hello, Sharks.
My name is Wendy Colson,
and my company is Boobie Bar,
and I am seeking $150,000
for 10% of my company.
Sharks, Boobie Bar is
the hottest spot in Las Vegas.
Just kidding!
[ Laughter ]
Well, I'm out.
Sorry to disappoint you.
Boobie Bar
is a lactation bar
designed
for breast?feeding moms,
the most convenient
and yummiest way
to support a healthy
milk supply.
As a lactation consultant,
I have witnessed
the beautiful relationship
between Mom and baby
when breast feeding.
But it's also a stressful time
where moms worry
about their milk supply.
Some moms will turn
to lactation herbs
to increase their
milk production,
but they are stuck ??
stuck swallowing up
to 15 pills a day
or brewing
up to six cups of tea.
Who has time for that
when you just had a baby?
So I combined a proprietary
blend of organic lactation herbs
into one delicious bar
to take on the go
for the busiest people
on the planet ?? moms!
So come on, Sharks,
help me help more moms
reach their lactation goals,
and let's make Boobie
a household name.
[ Laughter ]
I brought you some to taste.
Great.
What happens if men eat it?
[ Chuckles ]
Well, if I could get
a man to lactate...
If ??
if you see a leak...
I would ?? I would already
be sitting in your chairs.
Thank you, Daymond.
O'Leary: Right here.
Thank you.
?Mr. Wonderful.
?Thank you.
Cuban: Thank you, Wendy.
Blakely: So, these are three
different flavors?
?Three different flavors.
?Okay.
Wendy, what's your
top?selling flavor?
Colson: Oatmeal chocolate chip.
John: It's good, actually.
?Thank you!
?It is good.
Colson: There's a gluten?free
peanut butter.
Greiner: Ooh, I like
the peanut butter one.
And there's
a blueberry coconut.
The peanut butter
one's gluten?free?
Yes.
This is good.
If I had knockers,
I'd eat this every day.
How many other lactation
bars are there?
There are no other lactation
bars in the commercial market.
I wanted to give a more
convenient way
for the millennial mom
to take her herbs.
A lot of people ??
I have to ask a question ??
Do you have any proof
that they work,
other than anecdotal
or personal ??
Anecdotal, for sure.
So, Wendy, is the story
for thousands of years,
women have used these herbs
and spices to support lactation?
Right.
That's ??
There's no medical test ??
They help other things,
right.
?Okay. Yeah.
?But you don't have ??
To Mark's point, you haven't
done any clinical trials.
Not clinical, but I,
before releasing the product,
I did
my own independent study.
So, I gave a group of moms
that I didn't know
and just asked them
to eat one bar a day,
and then we studied
their milk supply
and we saw in??
increases from 1.5 to 4.6 a day.
Ounces?
Ounces, which is like
an extra feed.
I've used this product
since 2011 with my patients.
I'm a registered nurse,
and I'm also
an internationally
board?certified
lactation consultant.
I'm an expert
in breast feeding.
There's no higher credentials
for breast?feeding education.
I might be one of the only
people on the panel ??
I don't know ??
that's breast fed, and ??
?Mark breast fed.
?Wait a second.
I breast fed as well.
It was a lot of years ago,
but I was involved.
At Spanx, most of
my employees are women,
and we actually
have lactation rooms.
Mm?hmm.
And I think
this is interesting.
Cuban:
So, anybody can make a claim,
and anybody can mislead
a mother who needs the help ??
No.
No, no.
I'm not making a claim.
That's what's ??
But you are making claims
because you have a bar
that you say
is going to improve the ability
for a mom to lactate, right?
But the expectation
of the mom
is that she's gonna
get a result,
yet you have no proof
that she's able to get a result
other than your
personal experiences.
?This is not ??
?Well, look ??
Blakely: Okay, there's all these
energy bars on the market,
and the herbs and the different
ingredients in the energy bars
are what has been proven
to give energy.
She has ??
Are you serious?
?Yeah.
?What do your customers say?
Colson: All right, let me ??
let me first ??
I?I hear you all,
and I totally get it,
and I want you to know that.
You're probably not in business
to sell one bar to one person,
'cause if it doesn't work,
then you don't have
a business, right?
And I think the bottom line
is the proof is in the pudding,
and as you've been
out selling it
have you been getting
reorders?
Absolutely.
Can you give us
information about that,
because, you know, I have
a 15?month at home,
and I know the ??
the need for it.
Right.
So just tell us about
how many customers
you had, reorders,
and things of that nature.
Absolutely.
Okay, so right now
on my website,
I have a 52% repeat customer.
Last month was 86%.
Those are
impressive numbers.
How many have you sold
since inception?
My total sales...
So, what year did you start?
...in ?? in 2 years
are $778,000.
?Whoa!
?Nice!
That's fantastic.
And I ??
Well ?? Well,
hold on there, cowboy!
Well, wait a minute!
Yippie?aye?oh?ki?yay.
Now you're speaking
their language, right?
Right.
Okay.
O'Leary: I believe in sales,
so let's just talk about
how many women are lactating
at any one time in the market.
How many in America?
There's about
3.8 million births a year.
81% initiate breast feeding,
which means about
3 million moms.
How do you get to them?
I'm in 500 stores.
What stores?
Buy Buy Baby, Babies"R"Us,
I just got Walmart.
How many stores
are they putting into?
200, because it goes
in a specific section.
?Yeah, yeah.
?Got it, got it.
?And they're testing it.
?So they're testing 200.
So they started
a woman's section...
?Yeah.
?...a one?stop shop aisle
for a woman
who just had a baby.
Have they told you their target
sell?through to roll it out?
No, they ?? Um, I just know
I go on shelves in January.
First of all, there's a huge
need for lactation expertise,
so I'm not trying
to denigrate the need.
But that said, what concerns me
is you're making money,
and if you really do get
confirmation through a study,
you could be the one
that solves the problem.
That should be
the first thing...
Mm?hmm.
...'cause then every doctor's
gonna recommend it.
Every box can say
"Clinically proven
to solve your problem
in these circumstances."
Mm?hmm.
The fact that you don't,
to me,
is just one more curse of
the supplement business, right,
'cause everybody
makes lots of claims
and people who are desperate
spend their money.
I'm out.
Thank you.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Because you don't have the
clinical testing at this time,
I can't put my name
behind it,
and for that reason,
I'm out.
Wendy, I'm struggling
because I love the mission
behind what you're doing.
Where I'm getting caught up
is on the proven results.
Like, that matters so deeply
to me for the consumer.
The moms come back ??
they buy.
I know,
and I'm so proud of you,
and I'm happy that
you have happy customers,
but it's for
that reason that I ??
I need to be out.
Thank you, Sara.
You guys, I have something
called Club Boobie Bar.
You sign up, and you get
five boxes, 30?day supply, $79.
I've had women on
Club Boobie Bar for over a year,
so I know there's no,
like, clinical proof,
but why would they buy...
?Wendy, good news.
...over and over ??
A third of my wine buyers
are in my wine club.
They get a case
every 90 days.
I have a massive
fulfillment facility doing this.
I love this business.
Mm?hmm.
Your proof is sales.
In sales, I trust.
I will give you
$150,000 for 20%.
I think
a lot of work ahead ??
You have no idea
what Walmart's gonna be like.
I do.
That's an extraordinary
opportunity.
Good on you
for getting it,
but get ready
for some serious work,
and serious
full?time employees.
And legal work, too.
Thank you for your offer.
Is there anyone else
that has anything?
John: I think
you're the real deal.
I don't necessarily agree
with my fellow Sharks,
on if it could be
credible or not
'cause I just really believe
that you either see
it's working,
or you don't, right?
Right.
And I ?? And that's it.
Uh, but I think
you're the star,
and I think your information
has to get out there.
I don't want you to be stuck
manufacturing and warehousing.
My intent is to take you,
and we license this thing,
and you are the face,
so $150,000 and 20%.
Thank you so much
for your offer.
Okay, Wendy, you have
two offers ??
both $150,000 for 20%.
What are you going to do?
They're both amazing offers.
That's what makes
this so difficult.
I... [ Sighs ]
But you have to make
a decision.
I know, I know.
Do you go with the guy
who's currently going through
the same situation
that those mothers
will be going through,
or do you go with somebody who
is going through male menopause?
You have to make
a decision.
?You know what?
?And welcome to the Shark Tank.
Daymond, you have
a very good point.
You are in the trenches
with what ??
exactly what this product is.
Daymond, I accept your offer.
Yeah!
[ Laughter, applause ]
All right.
That last stab ??
I got him.
Thank you, thank you ??
Congratulations.
Thank you.
John: I love it.
?You're in the Boob business!
?Boobie Bar.
Of course you love it.
Yeah!
Colson:
I mean, that was so hard.
I am just so excited,
because I?I couldn't ask
for a better Shark.
