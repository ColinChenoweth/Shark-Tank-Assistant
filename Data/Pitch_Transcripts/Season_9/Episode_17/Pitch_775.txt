Hi, Sharks.
My name is Eugenia,
and I'm from
San Clemente, California.
I have to apologize ??
My business partner
isn't here yet.
He couldn't keep track of time
if his life depended on it ??
can't even get himself dressed
in the morning sometimes.
Huxley?
Huxley, come on!
Come on, buddy.
[ Laughter ]
?Come on! Good boy!
?Aww!
?[ Laughs ]
?What?
What is that?
All right.
[ Laughter ]
Don't be afraid ??
This panda is domesticated.
I'm Eugenia, and this is
Huxley the Panda Puppy.
We're here seeking $60,000 for
20% of our company, Pandaloon.
Our Panda Puppy costume
transforms your pet
into the perfect
walking teddy bear.
Now your dog doesn't have
to be just a dog ??
He can be a turducken of cute.
Have a look.
[ Laughter ]
Would you mind, uh,
holding Huxley for a second?
?I'll hold the puppy!
?Okay.
?Aww!
?Aww!
Cuban: Someone gets
to hold the panda.
He's ?? Ooh!
And you can take him
out if you like.
Hi!
?Mr. Wonderful.
?Thank you very much.
Blakely: Thank you.
Eugenia,
this is good quality.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Is it possible to put Huxley
in this one?
Sure. Yeah.
[ Chuckles ]
So, do you need a small
rat?size dog,
or can you have
a larger dog?
[ Laughs ]
They can be sized
to fit larger dogs.
That's part of what I tried
to make sure I designed it for,
was to fit a variety
of dog shapes.
Eugenia,
what's your background?
Well, I'm from San Clemente,
California, a little beach town.
My parents immigrated
here from Taiwan.
So I went on,
did well in school,
I got my masters
in computational science,
my bachelor's in math
and applied science.
I, um, was pursuing research
in computational neuroscience
at the Salk Institute
where I used genetic algorithms
to optimize a neural network.
I also teach math.
And you do this.
So, I graduated during the
height of the recession.
Since I graduated, I have
been stringing together
three, four,
five part?time jobs,
and so that's what really
drove me to start this business.
Have you sold any
or taken preorders, or ??
Yes. I'm actually in the middle
of the manufacturing process.
They'll be ready
in about one month.
What are your costs?
It's about $4 landed
depending on the size.
And then
what do you charge?
What's the retail?
I've been, uh, p?proposing the
retail price at $39.99, but ??
Whoa.
Daymond, I researched
the largest c??
costume manufacturer
in the world,
and they actually have costumes
that are animal?themed as well,
and their price point
was about the same, actually,
for a far less
quality of product, so ??
I think that's
a perfect price.
All right. Well, I created
two sizes so far.
?Aww!
?Aww!
Aww, not quite as good
as the panda, but still good.
So right now you're taking
preorders, correct?
Yes, just very quietly.
And how did you do that,
though?
Pandaloon
is my online store.
We've been in business
for about three years.
Um, we do about $100,000
in revenue every year.
?What do you sell?
?We sell just apparel, gifts.
A lot of things with pandas ??
some things without.
Blakely:
So, Eugenia, would be buying
a portion of Pandaloon,
which you currently
already have
or this new concept
of the costume?
I went ahead and bundled it all
together, because I know that ??
Obviously, I don't have,
you know,
an impressive sales figure
to show you of these costumes,
but I do have proof
that I can sell $300,000
worth of inventory over
the lifetime of my business,
I've been profitable
since my very first year.
I've done it all myself.
Okay. What exactly do you
need the money for?
In order to go ahead and expand
my costume into a line,
I would need to have
the inventory
ready for this Halloween.
So in order to do that,
I would need an investment
of a bare minimum of $60,000
to get most of these SKUs
to meet their minimum
order quantity.
So, Eugenia,
I'm fascinated.
It's a heck of a story, and
obviously I?I found the outfit,
to say the least,
intriguing.
But I have to be
honest with you ??
I've never really
understood people
that dress up rat dogs
in outfits.
It's just bizarre.
I'm not suggesting you are.
I'm just saying I'm out.
Okay.
Okay.
I think you're phenomenal.
I was more interested in the
neural network side of it.
I figured.
[ Laughter ]
But seriously, I think
you'll do great.
It's just not a fit for me,
so for that reason, I'm out.
Greiner:
And, Eugenia, I'm sorry,
I just don't see
a huge market for this.
I'm out.
Eugenia, I think the fact
that we all
almost curled over
laughing ??
I think bringing
that joy is ?? is evident.
I have an offer for you.
I'll give you the $60,000
for 35%,
and I'm gonna donate 10%
of my 35%
to animal charities.
So, Eugenia, I'm gonna
make you an offer.
I like this, and I like you.
Narrator: Three Sharks are out.
Eugenia has an offer
on the table from Daymond
for her pet costume business,
Pandaloon.
But Sara is also interested.
Eugenia, I'm gonna
make you an offer.
I like this,
and I like you.
Oh, you're kidding.
I'm not kidding.
Okay.
I'm gonna match
Daymond's offer.
I'm gonna give you
$60,000 for 35%.
I have more than I can bring
to the table with my platform
and all of the women
that I'm reaching out to,
and I think that
most of the people
that are gonna buy costumes
for their dogs are women.
I think you're special.
I can tell that you're gonna
make this work, so...
Thank you so much.
Yeah.
I really appreciate that.
So, you have
two great Sharks,
two great offers
on the table.
Would you ever entertain
a deal together?
Are you willing to give
away more equity?
Yeah, yeah.
I'd be open to that.
I'll be very honest.
I ?? I?I have respect
for Sara.
I don't know her history here.
She probably can add
a massive amount of value,
but I think I'm gonna
ride with this alone.
I'm gonna stick
with my offer.
Eugenia, you got
to make a decision.
?Man, you made me beg for that.
?Thanks for asking, Eugenia.
I'd love to wear
the panda outfit.
Thank you.
Not at all.
Thank you so much.
?So crazy.
?Congrats.
?Congratulations!
?Congratulations.
?Good job.
Chen: It was more equity than
I initially planned on
coming in with,
but, you know, I know
what kind of value
that Daymond
brings to the table.
Um, it's incredible,
and I love that
we're going to
support rescues, too.
You know, I think I'm coming
down with something,
'cause I just dreamt
that you gave $60,000
for a rat?dog outfit.
