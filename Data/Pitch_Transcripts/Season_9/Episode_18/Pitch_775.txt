My name is Jonathan Diersing,
and my company's Rounderbum.
I'm here today asking
for $150,000
in exchange for 10%
of my company.
Sharks, there's nothing better
than walking out the front door
full of confidence,
ready to conquer the world.
Whether you have a board meeting
that day,
a date,
or a red?carpet event,
regardless of the occasion,
when you look good,
you feel good.
And, Sharks, who doesn't want
to look and feel good
every day and everywhere?
I mean, how many times
do you find yourself
putting on a pair of jeans
that just don't fit right?
Maybe they're too big
or too loose or too flat.
Have you ever wished,
while getting ready
in front of the mirror,
that you had a little bit more
back here or even up here?
[ Laughter ]
Sharks, for centuries,
women have had their ways
of enhancing
the shape of their body.
Men, on the other hand,
have been stuck with
what they've got, or don't got.
It's time to say goodbye
to those saggy jeans
and hello to sexy.
[ Gasps ]
Oh, my. They're twins.
Introducing Rounderbum.
[ Laughter ]
Rounderbum
is a body?shaping technology
that is redefining
the underwear market,
giving each person
a boost in confidence
that they've been looking for.
Rounderbum offers different
underwear technologies
to help you look
and feel amazing
before you walk out
that front door.
[ Chuckles ]
"Underwear technologies."
Not only do we offer
your traditional
compression shapewear,
we go one step further.
We enhance the shape
of your body from head to toe,
giving you more lift
and volume
in the areas
that you desire most,
helping you look and feel
amazing.
Our model here is wearing
our padded trunk,
along with
our padded muscle shirt.
Now, Sharks,
I know you guys might not need
any help with confidence,
but our customers love
the way they look and feel
when they wear Rounderbum.
And more importantly, they're
made for comfort and discretion.
They're invisible
under clothing,
and they feel natural
to the touch.
Sharks, we're not just changing
the way that people look.
We are changing the way
that people live.
So who's with me?
Who's ready to turn this square
world into a Rounder world?
?[ Chuckles ]
?All right.
We'll now pass out some samples
for you guys to see,
but you can see
the before?and?after look.
Herjavec: Oh, my Lord.
[ Laughter ]
My goodness.
You can really tell
the difference.
Right?
?Yeah.
?Thanks.
So, they'll be passing out
some samples
that we want to show you.
The padded trunk, you can
actually pull out the pad
that you can feel
and see for yourself.
?Thank you.
?Oh, my goodness.
The cool thing about this pad is
that it's made with a zero edge,
so the whole purpose of this
is to not have a lining
underneath your clothes
to make it invisible to the eye.
Jonathan, why do men
want bigger butts?
Everybody appreciates
the way they look,
and everybody
wants to look better.
I mean, not everybody has
the time to go to the gym.
Women wear shapers.
Men wear shapers now.
There's Manx.
What's the difference between
this and Spanx for men?
So, Spanx is more
of a compression.
What is the price point
of this?
He's not compression.
He's addition.
Diersing: $25.
?How much?
?$25.
?$25. That's a lot.
?Is that a lot?
We find it
pretty competitive.
So, what are your sales?
I mean, that's ??
What are your sales?
So, we launched our website
in May 2015,
and to now, we've sold
over $1 million in sales.
?Whoa!
?What?!
I never thought
you would say that.
But that's more than two years.
That's more than two years.
Are you kidding me?
What have you done
in the last 12 months?
In the last 12 months,
we did $700,000.
?What?
?Is that at a store or online?
?This is online only.
?Only.
So we have
our online retail store,
and then Amazon
is a major customer of ours.
I'm amazed
you're selling that much.
How are people
even finding you?
Our advertising.
We're trying to get as much good
advertising as possible.
Where are you advertising?
Facebook's, like,
our number one.
You did $700,000 in sales.
You should be making money
hand over foot.
You should be crushing it.
What's your profit on that?
Our net is about 25% to 35%.
?Wow.
?Okay. So you're making $200K.
But that means you took home
$200K last year, right?
Yes.
So what do you need
the money for?
We need the money because,
as of now,
it's pretty much me
working here.
I want to hire
an amazing marketing team
to help me create
some viral videos,
create awareness, so that people
invest more in Facebook.
The more we invest,
we're seeing more return.
And also, we recently did ??
we got a brick?and?mortar store
in West Hollywood, California,
on a prime location.
?Oh, there we go.
?John, you're killing it online.
What made you wake up
one day and say,
"I want to go
brick?and?mortar"?
Well, our prices
at our fulfillment center
are through the roof,
and I was like, "We got to find
out how to cut our costs.
So I'm gonna make half of it
a fulfillment center
and the other half
a place that people can go
and feel our product."
So it's cheaper for you
to hire somebody,
fulfill
out of the back of the store,
and then have the front
part be a store itself.
Diersing: Totally.
You know, in a real retail
location in West Hollywood
is cheaper
than a little warehouse?
?Oh, yeah.
?I know. I'm surprised.
Come on. You want to go into one
of the worst businesses, retail?
There's a reason why
that storefront was empty.
For us, if I can save
$3 an order, I'm saving that.
Why don't we try
and value your business
on this year's
coming sales?
So, this year, we anticipate
on hitting $1 million.
Next year, we anticipate
on hitting $2.7 million.
You're already doing sales.
Why are you trying to go
so fast?
Well, I have to acknowledge
that this wasn't
what I went to school for.
I went to school
for neuroscience at USC.
Cuban and Greiner:
Neuroscience?
So, my mom
has multiple sclerosis,
so I went to school
trying to figure out
if I wanted to be
the doctor to help her,
and going there, I was like,
"I don't have the drive
that these other students do,"
but I couldn't afford
to change my major,
'cause I paid
for school myself.
So I just finished it,
and then, after school,
I just started hustling,
started sales jobs,
and then, this was something
I was doing at the same time
because I was hoping
that I can do something
with my life to make my mom ??
And then, on your own, you're
gonna do over a million dollars,
and you don't think
that you have the knowledge.
That's what you're saying?
On your own, you're about to do
over $1 million.
I didn't ??
Yeah, well, as of now,
this is what we're creating
ourself.
I need to realize that
I'm not a professional marketer.
I really need ??
?Neither was I.
You've done a really good job,
though.
You've done a great job.
Diersing: Thank you.
I have a company
called Titan.
They make, uh...
?Yeah, I know.
...compression,
and it's weighted vests.
Yes.
When I wear it
and other people wear it,
it looks very similar
to this,
but it's more, right?
A lot more?
Oh, yeah. But that's more
for working out, right?
That's not something you wear
and then...
It's to work out,
and then I can explain,
"Hey, I'm just working out,"
right?
It causes a negative,
I think, question
because people think I'm trying
to bulk up for no reason.
Mm?hmm.
And I guess I just don't
understand it, so I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you, Daymond.
I think
it's very interesting.
I like it.
I'll give you $150,000,
but I want a royalty ??
2 bucks off every unit ??
that's a dollar
for each cheek ?? and...
[ Laughter ]
...I'll take 5% equity.
The royalty ends
when I double my money.
I get $300,000 out, done,
and then I'm your partner
with the 5% equity I've got.
Okay. Now, Mr. Wonderful,
what can you offer me?
Can you help me get into the
major retailers of the country?
The great news about getting
a Shark as a partner is,
everybody returns
any Shark's call,
so I'll do that for you.
Mm?hmm.
You tell me which retailers
you want to talk to,
and I'll call them,
but I'm not sure retail's
a great idea for you right now.
Okay.
Because you own
that inventory problem.
The better strategy
is to continue to pour gasoline
on your online sales
the way you've done it.
I'll simplify things,
right?
I've got to believe
in a product.
I go commando.
I'm out.
Hey, thank you.
I totally get it.
[ Laughter ]
Herjavec:
I got to change seats.
Thank you.
I never knew that,
but thank you.
Too much information,
Mark.
Greiner: TMI.
I think
what you're doing is great.
It feels real, it looks real,
you're marketing it correctly.
Even though
you had no background,
you figured it out.
I think you're doing great
just by yourself.
I don't think you need
an investment from me,
so I'm out.
Thank you so much.
Jonathan, you've done a great
job, but I can't get behind 10%.
Don't do it, Jonathan.
You're lowering my valuation,
so if you're willing
to double your investment,
I'd be willing
to go with that deal.
Very clever, but I'm not willing
to do that today.
$150,000, 20%.
I know what we can do.
?Tough decision.
Do you want this
as the face of your product?
Cuban: What are you gonna do,
Jonathan?
What are you gonna do?
Congrats, Jonathan.
Diersing: I didn't want to do
a royalty deal,
but Robert's deal was gonna
end up costing me a lot more.
And the fact that I can still
have a Shark on my side
and give up less equity
in my company
was a win?win situation
for all of us.
I've never heard a deal
here being negotiated in cheeks.
Your name is no longer
"Mr. Wonderful."
It's "Cheeks."
Mr. Cheeks to you.
I like it, I like it.
Narrator: Next up is
what the entrepreneurs believe
is the next hero
of cleaning tools.
