And I'm Glenn Archer.
We're from Alexandria, Virginia.
We're asking for $500,000
in exchange for 10%
of our company, Brush Hero.
So, I'm
an avid mountain?biker.
And I'm an adventurer, but more
importantly, I'm an F?16 pilot.
As car geeks and riders...
And pilots.
...we were looking for a
solution to our own problems ??
how to keep
our machines clean.
We were tired of jamming up
and scraping our knuckles
trying to clean our rides,
using brushes
and sponges and chemicals.
It simply didn't work.
Sharks, say goodbye to the zero
and hello to the Brush Hero.
The Brush Hero is an innovative
yet simple water?powered brush.
It cleans with amazing force,
powered by water pressure
alone ??
no batteries required.
It's fun and easy to use.
All you need to do
is connect the Brush Hero
to a low?pressure water source,
like a garden hose.
Check it out, Sharks.
This thing puts out
amazing torque.
I can press on it
really hard,
grab it with my hand, even,
or jam it into tight spaces,
and it just
keeps scrubbing.
We developed the Brush Hero
with car, motorcycle,
and bike detailing in mind,
but we quickly realized
that you can Brush Hero
virtually anything.
Use it on rain gutters,
barbecues, patio furniture...
or the propeller
on your Cessna.
What do you say, Sharks?
Be a hero and help us
fight the war on muck.
So, the best way
to actually get an idea
of what this thing can do
is to Brush Hero something.
?Yeah.
?Yeah.
?That'll be me.
Glenn, are you often
cleaning your own F?16?
Actually,
I'm a former fighter pilot.
I stopped flying in 1999.
But people do use it
to clean their airplanes,
'cause you can only use
a low?pressure water system
on an airplane.
What do you sell it for?
The basic configuration
is $34.99.
And, Kevin, is that
the basic configuration up there
that I see?
?Yes.
?That package?
?That package is correct.
?Can we see your packaging?
?Sure, of course.
?What's the cost?
?Right now, it's $6.50.
?Wow, that's a great margin.
?Wow.
?That's great.
?That is a great price.
But we can get the margins down
a lot further than that.
We can get it under $4
with a little more help.
?Really?
?Yes, sir.
O'Leary: What are you gonna sell
this year?
We're gonna do about $3 million
in total sales this year.
What are you gonna make
on that?
What are you gonna make
on the $3 million?
Well, we should end up making
about $300,000 to $400,000.
Greiner:
Where are you selling them?
We're doing most of
our direct?response
advertising on Facebook.
And you're spending how much
a day on your Facebook ads?
Well, to date, we've spent
$460,000 on advertising,
totally, across ??
And that generated
how much in digital sales?
$1.5 million.
You're asking me to pay
a 20 multiple for a brush.
Do you see any problem with
that before I eviscerate you?
A lot of it has to do with
our projections for next year.
What's the number
for next year?
Next year, $10 million.
?Oh.
?Okay. Well, look,
I'm gonna reverse engineer
this for you.
This is a free service.
I won't charge for it.
Which means you're getting
exactly what you paid for it.
O'Leary:
No, no, you're getting ??
I'm gonna tell you
what you're worth.
I think, if you went into
the private?equity world,
they would value your company
around seven times,
about $1.7 million,
which means
if you want to get $500,000,
you're gonna have to give up
about 33%.
Are you willing to give up 33%
of your company? Yes or no?
Narrator:
All Sharks are still in,
but they question
the valuation
of Kevin and Glenn's rotating
brush company, Brush Hero.
Are you willing to give up
33% of your company?
Yes or no?
I don't think we would.
So I predict
you won't get a deal.
How many others are there out
there like this?
?As far as competitors?
?Yeah.
?Nothing.
?Nothing?
Any device that turns water
in a low?pressure environment
usually can't produce
any torque.
Kevin, Glenn,
I'm not a big cleaning guy.
You know, I have Kevin to clean
my motorcycle and my car.
Just not something
that I get excited about.
I'm out.
Guys, it's tough for me
to know the distinction
between how much pressure
and what the mechanism is,
but it's also why you've had
to spend so much on marketing.
You're kind of in a race,
because you want to get it out
there as quickly as possible
before
other people replicate you.
That is tough
from a long?term basis,
and with that amount of money
for only 10%,
it's got to really be
a long?term benefit
that's gonna continue
to grow.
I'm not sure that'll happen,
so for those reasons, I'm out.
Okay.
I looked at it and said,
"You're worth $1.7 million."
I asked a crucial question,
would you give up 1/3,
and you said no.
So you actually predefined
your destiny with me.
I'm out because
your valuation is stupid.
Archer:
So, what do you think?
Lori,
they have products like this.
?They have products like that?
?There are products out there?
?With a hose.
?No way.
Yeah.
They said their patent
is on more torque,
but there are products that spin
that you can buy right now.
The exact same product?
My car?detailer guy
has them.
