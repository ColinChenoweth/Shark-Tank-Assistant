You don't have an order,
Disha.
What do you mean
by an order?
There's a reason why
that storefront was empty.
Guys,
they're freaking me out.
You're trying to talk yourself
out of it is what's going on.
Narrator:
First into the Tank
is an apparel brand
to make men feel more confident.
My name is Disha,
and I'm from Columbus, Ohio.
My company is Savy.
I'm seeking $100,000
in exchange for a
10% equity stake in my startup.
I love shopping online.
And you know,
as a teenager on a budget,
you can't ??
you can't, uh, negotiate
on prices at all, right?
So, Savy...
helps you...
set your price.
[ Exhales ]
?You're doing great.
?You're doing great.
?[ Chuckles ]
?Don't worry. Don't worry.
This is only the biggest moment
of your life.
?Ah...
?Yeah.
Savy democratizes the online
shopping experience
so you, the customer, can set
the price you're willing to pay
for the items that you love.
I used to save links
to my favorite products
so I could
check back up on them
and see if they had dropped
in price
so I could go back
and buy them.
But whenever I would go back,
they'd either be sold out
or out of my size.
I thought there had to be
a better way.
Enter Savy.
?Ta?da!
Say you're shopping online
at your favorite boutique,
and you see this dress
that you absolutely love.
You check its price
and realize it's way more
than you're willing to pay.
In most scenarios,
that business loses the sale.
But if your favorite boutique
is partnered with Savy,
you, the customer,
get to enter the price
that you're willing to pay,
and Savy will e?mail you
if it reaches
your desired price point.
You get a sweet deal,
and Savy helps businesses
by providing really critical
information about price.
So, Sharks, who's ready
to help shoppers
discover their savvy style
at an even savvier price?
?Good job.
?Good job.
Did I hear you say
you're a teenager?
?I just turned 20. Yeah.
?Congratulations.
If I'm a retailer
and I want
to actually sell an item,
can I just decide
to drop my price
and hit the bid
of somebody,
or do they exist
anonymously to me?
I don't know who they are.
?Yeah, so ??
?What's the answer?
The businesses themselves
get the prices entered
and the e?mails,
but if an item actually goes
on a discount
and it reaches
that price point,
the customer will
automatically get an e?mail.
To Kevin's point,
he's saying
if I just say
I want to spend $50 instead,
the retailer could say, "All
right, I'll sell it for $50."
?Yeah.
?They could.
They could reach out.
But the real main way
of it working is
instead of you having to
search every single week
to see if it's gone down...
?Mm?hmm.
...you say, "I want to pay
$80 instead of $100,"
and if they discount it,
they'll let you know,
and then the e?mail goes.
?Exactly.
How many users
do you have now?
So, I have 1,000 stores
that are using Savy currently
in the last ??
But how many users
have registered with you?
2,000.
How are you adding
your consumers,
and how are you adding
the stores?
[ Chuckles ] I'm getting them
through social media.
So, I realized that stores
convert a lot better
on Instagram DMs
and Facebook Messenger.
So I created an army
of Instagram bots.
I coded them out.
?You coded the bots?
?Yeah.
?Oh, that's very cool.
What's your background?
So, I caught
the entrepreneurial bug
between my junior and senior
year of high school.
I went to a program at MIT
called
the Launch Summer Program,
and I decided to start my first
startup called TacBoard.
And what did TacBoard do?
So, it was basically, like,
an aggregated shopping site
where you could name your price
for items that you liked.
So, we pulled products from
a bunch of different retailers
and housed them
on one site.
Is that operating?
No, so, I was 18 at the time.
The coders
that built out TacBoard,
they didn't build it scalably
'cause they were
high?school coders.
I knew TacBoard
wasn't the right product.
So I let go
of my entire team.
I was living at home.
I had foregone my scholarship
to the University of Michigan
for engineering,
and I was devastated.
I was by myself,
and my startup was dead.
Wait, wait, say that again.
You had a scholarship
to Michigan.
?Yeah.
?What happened to it?
I had deferred my admission
because I thought that TacBoard
was gonna keep sustaining.
So you decided
not to do engineering
because TacBoard would be
your boat that you'd ride.
Your thing.
?Yeah. Yeah.
?What did you do next?
I lived with my parents up
until recently.
I moved to Wilmington,
North Carolina.
I'm finally out of the house.
Why did you move
to North Carolina?
I led a program
for gang leaders.
You don't have an order,
Disha.
What do you mean by
an order?
Until they give you an actual
deal on paper with money...
?Mm?hmm.
?...it means nothing.
It's just a conversation.
Greiner:
You know, the problem is
we have to know tangibly
what are we investing in.
Mm?hmm.
I don't feel like this
is fully fleshed out yet.
I'm out.
John: So, I think that
there are a lot of other
products out in the market
where I can find pricing
not the same exact way as yours.
I just don't see ??
?Wait, wait, wait.
If the person's price point
is actually met,
there's an 87% chance
that they'll actually convert
into a paying customer.
But you haven't ?? you haven't
converted any just yet.
?No, no, I have.
?So you can't give us an 87??
Have you taken a dollar
from a person?
I haven't taken a dollar because
I'm collecting this data.
So you have not ?? You're not
getting that part of it.
Everybody's gonna tell you
your baby's beautiful,
but until they take
a hard?earned dollar
out of their pocket
to give it to you,
it means nothing.
It's just their opinion.
I'm out.
