And my name
is Randy Rothfus.
And we are the creators
of the Guzzle Buddy!
The Guzzle Buddy!
[ Laughs ]
We are here today
seeking $400,000...
Wow.
...for a 10% stake
in our company.
?Damn, that's a lot of guzzling.
?Wow!
?I know how this is gonna end!
?Whoo?hoo!
?Yeah!
?Guzzle!
Now, Sharks,
let me ask you a question.
Have you ever
judged somebody for drinking
straight from the bottle?
No, 'cause I was always
drinking from the bottle.
?No.
?[ Laughs ]
?Well, that ??
?Th?at's what's up! [ Laughs ]
Well, we have the solution
to all your drinking problems.
Introducing the Guzzle Buddy
wine?bottle glass.
It turns your bottle
into your glass.
?What do you mean?
?Oh, and don't worry.
We have one for you soda
and beer lovers, too.
?You simply plug it...
?You simply plug it...
?...and chug it.
?...and chug it.
?Ohh!
?Cheers!
?My God!
?Ohh!
?Ohh!
?Ahh.
It makes drinking
from the bottle "classy."
Okay, now,
our silicone sleeve
fits in most bottles of beer
and wine.
And it fits in most bottles
of soda and hard cider.
It's made from a strong
borosilicate glass.
It's dishwasher?safe,
and it's freezer?safe!
So go ahead. Feel free to chill
it, plug it, and chug it.
Now, who's ready to try drinking
from the bottle with class?
?Let's try it!
?Yeah, yeah.
?Come on! Come on.
?I'll do the wine.
I'll do the wine.
?I'll do the wine.
?Oh, it's Mad Dog 20/20!
?Whoa!
?What?!
?Thank you.
And so I thought
Randy and I love our wine,
so I knew we needed
this product.
But I looked everywhere for it
and couldn't find it.
No way!
And so we thought, "Well,
let's find a manufacturer.
Let's go out."
And through trial and error,
we came up with this product.
You heard the catcalls when
you said $400,000 for 10%.
?Yes.
?If it's a $4 million value...
Yes.
Four ?? Let that roll
of my lips once again.
?Who has a $4 million value?
?$4 million.
He probably wants you to drink
that whole bottle of wine.
?$4 million valuation.
?Yep.
And that's because
your sales are huge!
?Yes!
?Drum roll.
We've sold $1.4 million
in 10 months!
?Oh! I'll drink to that!
?What?! What?!
?Ohh!
?Ohh! Yeah!
How the beep
is that possible?
I was doing
a little bit of social media,
and I put out a tweet
that said,
"You need to get
a Guzzle Buddy
to make it through
the next presidential debate."
?Ah!
?[ Laughs ]
But what happened was
a big social?media place
that had millions
of followers picked up on it,
took
some of the little videos
and pictures
that we had been making,
and put it out
to their 14 million viewers.
And the next thing you know...
?Wow.
Bam!
We sold out ??
Yep, we sold out in three days.
How much money did you make
on that in profits?
In profits?
$320,000.
?Whoa!
?Wow!
?Yeah!
?Wow!
What does one cost?
Well, one costs
the manufacturer $3.12.
And we sell them
for $24.99.
?Whoa!
?Wow!
So you sell one wine glass,
essentially...
Yes.
...for $24.99.
?That's amazing.
What's your history, though,
in products?
Well, I was a geologist for
a couple years until I was ??
What happened?
Well, I was blessed
by having twin girls
and became a stay?at?home mom
for the last 14 years.
How did you meet Randy?
This is
my brother?in?law.
I grew up on a dairy farm,
and I got up at 4:00 in
the morning and I milked cows ??
and they never go on vacation,
by the way.
I also
went to dental school.
You're a dentist?
Yes, so I was a dentist
for 20 years.
Then I had a hand surgery, and I
had to retire from dentistry.
So that was fairly devastating.
?Oh.
I mean,
I didn't know what to do.
And then Jennifer called me
one day and said,
"Hey, we need to find
this wine?bottle glass."
And the rest is history.
I predict everybody up here
loves you guys,
but I predict nobody is gonna
give you $400,000 for 10%.
That's over 10 times
the best?case scenario
of what you'll make.
We have sold the $1.4 million
in 10 months in just the wine.
We just came out
with the beer,
and we project that it's going
to do the same as it did ??
you know,
as the wine has done.
So we're valuating that ??
I didn't like it
with the beer.
It ??
Because it goes too slowly.
Right.
You know, when you guzzle it,
you're like, "Boom!"
Cuban:
Let me just tell you this.
You're celebrating ?? When
the Mavs win the championship,
you're drinking
out of the bottle, right?
Right.
When you see somebody drinking
out of the bottle,
that gets in the way.
Unless they want
the attention.
From that?
?Yes!
?Absolutely!
If you're drinking this
in your house,
chances are
you have a problem.
?Guys. Guys.
?I'm out.
You know what, the worst thing
an entrepreneur can do
is talk theory.
?Mark's out.
?What happened?
?He's out.
?Mark is out, Daymond.
?Why?
?I'm out.
?Because he doesn't want
to give them $400,000.
John: You know what,
I love the numbers.
That's like
talking dirty to me.
?[ Laughs ]
?Here is my thing.
This is a space
that some other Sharks here
would be way more valuable in
regards to a strategic partner.
It's not for me.
I'm out.
?Well, thank you.
?Okay, thank you.
There's one thing I've learned
over the past several years.
?Only one?
?No. Many.
[ Laughter ]
700 or so products later,
it's very fascinating
to me ??
America drinks.
?No! I don't believe it!
?Yes!
So I get
how you've done $1.4 million.
But that is a staggering,
crazy, huge number.
Will you be able
to sustain that?
That's my big question.
It went viral in October,
and we were thinking
the same thing ??
"Is this going to kind
of fizzle out at the new year?"
But we've continued
to sell.
Jennifer, as I travel around
the country, people say to me,
"If I could only invent
a better mouse trap..."
?Yes.
?[ Chuckles ]
And I always say to them,
"There's no such thing
as a better mouse trap.
It's all about execution."
?Sure.
And this big, fancy answer.
And guess what, I'm wrong.
It's a better mouse trap.
It's cool.
You're a dentist, a mom.
And here you are
on "Shark Tank."
Incredible!
You've done everything right,
except one thing.
What's that?
When you start asking
for $400,000 for 10%,
how do we get behind that?
Like, if you would have asked
for a couple hundred thousand,
everybody here would have said,
"Love them! I'm in!"
At $400,000 for 10%, you've got
to have backend operations.
This is a real ??
even for the Sharks,
we think twice
before putting in $400,000.
?Sure.
?I can't see it.
I'm out.
I'm choking on the $400,000
for 10%, at any percent.
There's no way in the world
I'm writing a check
for $400,000 for this.
It just ain't gonna happen.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you. Appreciate it.
I'm the only one left.
First and foremost,
I go with my gut.
And my gut tells me
you're good, honest people.
I like you.
?Thank you.
?Uh?oh.
?Don't do it, Lori.
$1.4 million in sales.
That's staggering
in 10 months.
I agree with my fellow Sharks.
It's a crazy valuation.
I mean,
this is a novelty gift.
So I'm gonna give you
an opportunity
to convince me
why I should go in,
and I'm gonna ask you
to be creative
with the valuation
that everybody else stepped on.
in Randy and Jennifer's novelty
glass company, Guzzle Buddy.
I'm gonna give you
an opportunity
to convince me
why I should go in,
and I'm gonna ask you
to be creative
with the valuation
that everybody else stepped on.
Because at $400,000 for 10%,
I will not give you a deal.
You know, I mean,
I feel so strongly
because of the way we have
continued to have sales.
I was worried
after the first of the year.
I was like,
"What's gonna happen?"
A lot of talking.
No numbers.
[ Chuckles ]
I mean, what do you think
for numbers, Jennifer?
Um...
I mean, you had a number
that you would go to
when you came in.
?Yeah.
You knew we'd negotiate it.
?Just be honest.
Rothfus: I think Daymond is ??
brings a lot to Guzzle Buddy.
For one thing, he is a master
at building a brand,
and that's
what we want to do.
We don't want to be
a one?product wonder.
We want to be a brand,
and I think that ??
I think we nailed it
with Daymond.
Daymond, you just bought
a glass on top of a bottle.
[ Laughter ]
The Shark Tank's going crazy.
