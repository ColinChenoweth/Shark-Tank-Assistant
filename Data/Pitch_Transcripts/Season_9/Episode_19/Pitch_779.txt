Sara Blakely, joins the Tank.
These two Shark women are gonna
take a huge bite out of you.
Join me as we show
the world
the beauty of Africa
in design.
So, who wants to blow this
market out of the water?
I like a lot of it,
but not enough of it.
?As a mom, it's a hit.
?As a dad, it's a hit.
As a future teller,
it sucks.
I have to call out
the white elephant
for me in the room.
Radzely: I just need that person
that has been there,
done that,
knows how to make money.
We're ready to scale.
I think that it's super?cool.
Oh, I can't get it off,
for real!
[ Loud pop ]
?Oh!
Oh, my God!
And that is how you do a deal.
Narrator:
First into the Tank
is what
the entrepreneurs believe
is a more elegant way to gift.
Sara, are you okay?
Yeah, yeah.
So, you need
to fasten it
because the resistance
allows the zipper to open.
?Okay.
?Oh, my God.
That was just
a horrifying experience.
[ Laughter ]
So, doesn't this require
some sort
of organizational approvement
from somebody ??
Yes. So, this is approved
by the U. S. Coast Guard,
and that was
a huge hurdle for us.
?Oh, wow.
?But inflatable life jackets
are not approved
for activities
where there's a likelihood
of hitting your head.
So, for instance, water?skiing,
white?water kayaking,
where there's a higher potential
of you being incapacitated.
Is there a model
that you could offer
that auto?inflates
when it hits water?
Okay. So, this has actually
always been the long?term vision
for this product was
to make it a smart device.
Maybe I can tell you
a little bit more
about where this idea
came from,
since it's...
?Yeah, please.
When I was in college
a few years ago,
I think that Sara gave you
a really good offer.
I love your platform.
And I'm about to tell Sara
that if all these
other offers are gone,
she should up it to 20%.
I know, I know.
So I'm out,
but I'm telling you ??
?Okay.
?If I were to say,
"I'd like to partner with Sara,"
we'd need more stake in the game
is the problem.
You know, because we both
have to wake up
and really work for you.
These two Shark women are gonna
take a huge bite out of you
that Mr. Wonderful doesn't
think is a good deal.
I realize that.
?Sara.
?Yes?
Would you like to partner
on this?
What do you have in mind?
Um, you were at 15%.
I think we'd need to be
at 20%...
?Ouch! Ouch!
?...so that we'd each be 10%.
?Oh.
?God...
It's so expensive.
I would handle for you
the retail end
and helping to blow it up
and really get this out
as a household name.
So I will do the deal
with Lori.
Okay.
Is that the only way
you'll do the deal?
Yes.
So now you have
two distinct offers.
?Yes.
?What are you going to do?
?I would like to counter both.
?Ooh.
I would like to throw it
out there to see if you could
come in with more cash
for the 20%.
Maybe half a million dollars.
?Wow.
And I would like to see
if Mr. Wonderful ??
if you would come down to 7%...
?Mm.
?...for $250,000.
I don't want to fall below
my last round.
Well, I'm giving you exactly
what your last round was.
I will stay at 10%
because I actually think
I add a lot of value, as well.
More than half of my companies
are run by women just like you,
and they make me
a lot of money.
So at the end of the day,
I'd be happy to invest in you,
but I'm not gonna do it
for less than 10%
because I want to care
about my investment.
So I want skin
in the game, too.
Blakely: Everybody wants skin
in the game.
Yes.
But you have, I think,
a really beautiful opportunity
standing there
with Sara and I.
Our offer holds at 20%...
?It does.
?Mine's at 10%.
?...but you get two Sharks.
What are you gonna do?
?What am I gonna do?
You've got to make a decision.
This is your moment.
Then, I believe that I...
You know, Sara,
you're so greedy.
You're so greedy.
