Sara Blakely, joins the Tank.
These two Shark women are gonna
take a huge bite out of you.
Join me as we show
the world
the beauty of Africa
in design.
So, who wants to blow this
market out of the water?
I like a lot of it,
but not enough of it.
?As a mom, it's a hit.
?As a dad, it's a hit.
As a future teller,
it sucks.
I have to call out
the white elephant
for me in the room.
Radzely: I just need that person
that has been there,
done that,
knows how to make money.
We're ready to scale.
I think that it's super?cool.
Oh, I can't get it off,
for real!
[ Loud pop ]
?Oh!
Oh, my God!
Sara, are you okay?
Yeah, yeah.
So, you need
to fasten it
because the resistance
allows the zipper to open.
?Okay.
?Oh, my God.
That was just
a horrifying experience.
[ Laughter ]
So, doesn't this require
some sort
of organizational approvement
from somebody ??
Yes. So, this is approved
by the U. S. Coast Guard,
I think that Sara gave you
a really good offer.
I love your platform.
"I'd like to partner with Sara,"
we'd need more stake in the game
is the problem.
You know, because we both
have to wake up
?Sara.
?Yes?
Would you like to partner
on this?
What do you have in mind?
Um, you were at 15%.
I think we'd need to be
at 20%...
?Ouch! Ouch!
?...so that we'd each be 10%.
?Oh.
?God...
It's so expensive.
You know, Sara,
you're so greedy.
You're so greedy.
