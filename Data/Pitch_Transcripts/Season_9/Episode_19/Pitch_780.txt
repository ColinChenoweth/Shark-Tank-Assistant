Hi! I'm Sal.
I'm Alex.
Sal's a good friend of mine,
known him for years.
So, my background is
digital media technology.
In my previous job, I co?founded
a digital?media company,
so for Bouquet Bar,
Let's get to the numbers
on sales.
Close to $100,000.
Close to $100,000
in four months?
How much of your own
money's in this business?
$600,000.
?Whoa.
?Wow!
where you have salespeople,
or is it all walk?in?
No, it's all salespeople.
We're ready.
We got the salespeople to do it.
You have the people
to do it here.
All right, I'll make
you guys an offer.
$150,000 for 20%,
non?negotiable.
Guys, I need an answer.
?Mark...
?Yes.
?...we accept your offer.
?We're here.
?Done.
?Nice.
All right.
?Thanks.
?All right.
Thank you, man.
?Congrats, guys.
?Congratulations, you guys.
?Thank you so much.
?Congrats.
?Thank you, guys.
?Bye.
Yeah!
?Whoo!

Newburger: We had
$1.3 million in sales
in our first three years
of business.
Five years since
doing a deal with Lori,
we've hit $28 million.
Thank you guys so much.
We're L. A. boys.
This is our hometown,
so to know that we can make
a difference
in this city that we love
is an incredible feeling.
is always at the point of sale
at the marina.
I'm assuming you don't have any
retail distribution yet, right?
Not yet, but we see
that as a big part
of our sales model.
But how low can you get
the price point down?
Because the $249, you've got to
really be dedicated
to being a water enthusiast
or an outdoor...
Yeah. So, we've been ordering
in such small quantities
to do $2 million or $3 million
or $4 million in sales.
So, we've never been on cycle,
from a retail perspective.
We're about to go
to three
of the biggest
industry trade shows, so ??
I care about right now.
I know what the risk is.
I know what the opportunity is.
...in sales
in under 2 1/2 years.
[ Applause ]
Thank you.
?Wow!
?That's amazing.
?Thank you.
?Okay.
Monthly, we're doing about
$220,000 in sales,
so about $50,000 in revenue.
So you make $50K a month.
Mm?hmm.
That's basically
off of your commission.
?Yes.
?Right.
So, basically,
you have no risk.
?Yeah.
?Which is brilliant.
?Yeah.
?But let me ask something.
There is a risk. You know,
when women order online,
it's a higher return rate often
because they order
two sizes, right?
"I don't know if I'm a 7
or an 8 today," right?
Yeah, that's happened.
What happens in the event
of a return?
Because you either have to put
that back in inventory
or send it back to Africa.
What happens in that?
or was that real sales
to retail?
So, in 2015, we were fully
funded on Kickstarter.
In 2016, we prototyped it,
countless iterations.
