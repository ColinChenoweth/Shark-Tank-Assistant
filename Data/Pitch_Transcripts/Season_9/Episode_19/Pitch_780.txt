Hi! I'm Sal.
I'm Alex.
And I'm David.
We're the owners
of Bouquet Bar.
We're seeking 10 ??
We're seeking $150,000
for 10% of our company.
Thank you very much.
[ Laughter ]
It's not always easy
buying a gift for someone.
Take a moment.
Think about the last time
you had to order a gift
for a family member,
friend,
or a co?worker.
Were you happy
with that purchase,
or did you just wind up
buying one of these gift cards
'cause you couldn't find
what you were looking for?
?Yes.
?[ Chuckles ]
Well, we have a perfect
solution for that.
Welcome to Bouquet Bar,
an online gifting platform
that has taken flowers,
unique gifts,
combined it
with amazing packaging
for a whole new elegant way
of gifting.
Here's how it works ?? Choose
one of our designer gift boxes,
then add the gift
of your choice.
Whether it's lavender?infused
dark chocolates,
organic tea blends,
or beautifully arranged flowers,
the possibilities are
endless with Bouquet Bar.
Add a custom note, finishing
touches to your gift box,
and send it to that
special someone.
So, Sharks, who wants
to help us...
All: Bring the art of gifting
to everyone?!
Okay, we're past that, guys.
Let's do some amazing treats.
?Okay.
?All right.
We like treats.
Don't we, Kevin?
A moment on the lips,
a lifetime on the hips, Lori.
You know what?
He always says that.
Only to a girl.
?I'm just saying...
?Wow!
?What is this?
It smells so good.
Oh, this is beautiful.
?Oh, my God! Mine is huge!
?Ooh, that's nice!
?I know. This is gorgeous.
?Look at that.
?This is nice.
?Wow!
Alex and I have known each
other for about 10 years.
We actually own a luxury
floral design company.
So, I've been in the flower
business for 25 years.
Okay.
I had my first
flower shop at 19.
I come very humble
backgrounds.
I had nothing coming to
this country as an immigrant,
so I've come up in flowers.
?What country?
?From where?
?From where?
?Iran.
?Iran.
So, I came here to study.
My parents just put me
in a plane, said,
"Here's 4 grand.
Go to America."
How old were you
when you came over?
15 1/2.
So you were 15 1/2,
came by yourself...
Yes, I worked at Burger King
at night after school.
Good for you.
Came here as an immigrant
myself, 9 years old.
My dad was selling pizzas
from a motor home,
sold ice cream in parks.
You name it.
I sold flowers
on a corner street.
I went to school,
Biochemistry major,
minor in Econ, wanted to be
a doctor, make dad proud.
I was volunteering
at the emergency room.
I'm premed,
I'm getting my degree.
Older gentleman came in,
all bloody and everything,
and I said, "You know what?
This is not for me.
I can't do that."
So we came out with Bouquet Bar
about two years ago,
and one day, we sat down
and we said,
"We're missing that right
technology person."
Sal's a good friend of mine,
known him for years.
So, my background is
digital media technology.
In my previous job, I co?founded
a digital?media company,
so for Bouquet Bar,
I'm in charge of all marketing
and all technology.
How much revenue
does your other business do?
About $3 million.
?Whoa.
?Annually.
?Okay, kiddies.
?Here we go.
And are we getting a piece of
that business in this deal, too?
We're not asking for that
business now.
Well, that's what you say.
[ Laughter ]
So, all of us, me included, have
many, many gifting companies.
I'm in the wedding business,
big?time.
So let's just pick
any one of them.
Wicked Good Cupcakes.
The number?one issue
of the business has been,
for the last four years
I've been involved,
is customer?acquisition cost.
How's it gonna work?
So, the data is, our customer
acquisition's about $60.
We're utilizing
Google CPC ??
So you're not making
any money at all.
As of right now ??
We just launched.
I know, but revenues
in the last four months.
Let's get to the numbers
on sales.
Close to $100,000.
Close to $100,000
in four months?
How much of your own
money's in this business?
$600,000.
?Whoa.
?Wow!
And what about
any external money?
Or just your own money?
?Just our own money.
What was the money spent on?
$300,000 of it was spent on
developing the product,
coming up with the process,
website, operation.
Okay.
Right now
I really want to stress,
we have a 6,200?square?foot
facility with a cooler.
We have about $300,000
worth of inventory
that will translate to about
$1 million to $1.2 million
in revenue.
We're ready to scale.
What about the focus on
the customer?acquisition cost?
You've got to get it down
to between 10 and 15 bucks.
Aziz: Yeah, exactly.
That's what our goal is,
and that's gonna take
a little bit of time.
Well, who is your customer?
Great. Good question.
Our customer right now
is males and females
between 35 and 55,
60% female and 40% males.
What we are here to tell you is,
you know what?
We're gonna teach
people to gift.
People are scared to gift.
They don't know how to gift.
So, I have to ?? I have to
call out the white elephant,
for me, in the room.
This looks just like
Sugarfina, right?
What is Sugarfina?
Sugarfina started off
with a box like this,
and they fill it
with different candies.
It's sort of their trademark.
It's not
their trademark, Lori.
Wait, wait, wait.
When people Google search,
they're gonna find Sugarfina,
and they're gonna find you.
And Sugarfina
is less expensive.
So, to me,
you need to do something
that is going to be
different.
And you are flower experts.
?Yes.
But you've got to think
of how are you gonna beat it
or be more unique
or different.
And we're already working on
that, Lori, to answer that.
Yes, Sugarfina
does have candies.
We do have a lot of other stuff
into play right now
that I'm designing
for the next lines.
To me, if you had come in
with really cool, innovative,
different,
gorgeous floral things
and your price was great,
I'd be going to you.
Lori, there is, though ??
I love your drive,
your passion, and who you are,
but you haven't figured
the business out yet,
and for that reason, I'm out.
?Well, Lori ??
where you have salespeople,
or is it all walk?in?
No, it's all salespeople.
So, can those salespeople
go out and sell
and just work on a commission
from their side?
Yeah.
How flexible are you to come up
with different designs?
'Cause it seems like
flowers are the hammer,
and everything else
is the nail.
We're innovative,
and I love to design more stuff.
All right.
So, getting down to business,
$150K for 10% is not enough.
Why'd you guys think 10%
was enough?
I think our ask is
not that high, Mark, honestly.
Million and a half valuation.
First, number one, you have to
put three or four companies
together in order to create
what we've created.
We know we're gonna need more
money, but we also ??
What are you gonna need more
money for and when?
You know, basically,
in regards to, like,
sales and operations
and also staffing ??
The whole point of being
a "virtual" e?commerce company
is that you don't have to
have a big staff,
and you can outsource or you can
virtualize a lot of it,
but you can get help to do that.
So why would you need
to spend a lot more money?
I don't think ?? I don't think
a lot more money,
but you know what?
For us, it's ??
Or is it because you have all
your money in inventory?
No, like, for ex??
No.
Guys, I was this close.
Mark, Mark, Mark.
H?H?? Here ?? Here ??
Mark, h?here's the thing.
Look ??
Narrator:
Four Sharks are out.
Mark Cuban is the last chance
for a deal for Bouquet Bar,
an online gift?box company.
Guys, I was this close.
Mark, Mark, Mark.
H?H?Here ??
?But that's just one number.
?Mark, here's the thing.
You've got to give up more,
or you're not gonna get a deal.
No, it's just, you got to spend
so much more.
?No, no, no.
?We don't ??
We have $100,000
in the bank right now.
If I have to refinance
my house,
if I have to put it
into this company,
I will do
whatever it takes.
No, I get that, right?
I get that.
But the thing is, right now ??
Look, we have inventory.
We're re??
We're ready to sell.
If you come in and say,
"Look, guys, I want you guys
to put this product in here,
and it's not gonna cost you
that much expense because
it's not that heavy.
Let's ship it,"
we can do that right now.
We're ready.
We got the salespeople to do it.
You have the people
to do it here.
All right, I'll make
you guys an offer.
$150,000 for 20%,
non?negotiable.
Guys, I need an answer.
?Mark...
?Yes.
?...we accept your offer.
?We're here.
?Done.
?Nice.
All right.
?Thanks.
?All right.
Thank you, man.
?Congrats, guys.
?Congratulations, you guys.
?Thank you so much.
?Congrats.
?Thank you, guys.
?Bye.
Yeah!
?Whoo!
?[ Laughs ]
Newburger: We had
$1.3 million in sales
in our first three years
of business.
Five years since
doing a deal with Lori,
we've hit $28 million.
Thank you guys so much.
We're L. A. boys.
This is our hometown,
so to know that we can make
a difference
in this city that we love
is an incredible feeling.
is always at the point of sale
at the marina.
I'm assuming you don't have any
retail distribution yet, right?
Not yet, but we see
that as a big part
of our sales model.
But how low can you get
the price point down?
Because the $249, you've got to
really be dedicated
to being a water enthusiast
or an outdoor...
Yeah. So, we've been ordering
in such small quantities
up to this point ??
less than a thousand ??
we think once we start
hitting better quantities
that we can bring
the price down.
So, it's lighter, it's thinner,
it's easier to store.
Mm?hmm.
It seems very,
very, very smart to me,
if I had to put one on,
I would want to be wearing that
over anything
I've ever seen.
?Mm?hmm.
?Mm?hmm.
I feel it's a little too early
for me to be investing
because I want you to be there
where you hit everything
you need to hit to then
become the "it" life vest.
But at the moment,
it's not there, so I'm out.
Okay. Thank you
for your feedback.
So, I hesitate in getting
involved in anything
that is liability?focused,
where someone might actually
not come out alive
because of the use
of the product,
so for that reason, I'm out.
Thank you
for your feedback.
I think it's super?cool,
but it is really a niche market
in a very crowded space,
so I'm out.
Okay.
Guys, this is just such a tough,
incredibly competitive market.
You got to spend a lot of money
in order to get to the point
where you make a lot of money,
and that's the catch?22
you guys are probably
running into right now.
It's just not a fit for me,
guys, so I'm out.
to do $2 million or $3 million
or $4 million in sales.
So, we've never been on cycle,
from a retail perspective.
We're about to go
to three
of the biggest
industry trade shows, so ??
I care about right now.
I know what the risk is.
I know what the opportunity is.
And we value what you would
bring to this business,
so would you do
$200,000 for...
...20%?
No.
It's not interesting.
You know, I'm very impressed
that you got the Coast Guard
to endorse it.
That, I've learned,
matters a lot.
But you guys are so far
from distribution.
You know, most people
that come in the Shark Tank
don't get any offer at all.
You have one,
and it's your last hope
because I didn't hear anybody
else making you an offer.
Would you do
$200,000 for...
...25%?
Not enough.
Mr. Wonderful, we're gonna have
to decline that 50/50 offer.
?Good for you guys.
?Good for you.
?Yeah.
?Well, good luck.
?Thank you very much.
?Congrats on the business, guys.
?Good luck at the trade show.
?Congratulations on everything.
Even though we didn't get
a deal today,
we're gonna keep going
with our product.
This is all about
saving lives,
and we know that if we get
the product out there,
we can help to make
a difference.
...in sales
in under 2 1/2 years.
[ Applause ]
Thank you.
?Wow!
?That's amazing.
?Thank you.
?Okay.
So, explain, if I'm a designer
and I want to be on your site,
what is the financial
relationship?
So, we charge
a 17% flat commission
to be on the marketplace,
and then we also charge
a monthly fee of $50.
And how many visitors
do you have to the site?
Monthly, we have
about 120,000 visitors.
?Good for you.
?So, now the question.
That's fabulous.
Last month, what
did you do in revenue?
Monthly, we're doing about
$220,000 in sales,
so about $50,000 in revenue.
So you make $50K a month.
Mm?hmm.
That's basically
off of your commission.
?Yes.
?Right.
So, basically,
you have no risk.
?Yeah.
?Which is brilliant.
?Yeah.
?But let me ask something.
There is a risk. You know,
when women order online,
it's a higher return rate often
because they order
two sizes, right?
"I don't know if I'm a 7
or an 8 today," right?
Yeah, that's happened.
What happens in the event
of a return?
Because you either have to put
that back in inventory
or send it back to Africa.
What happens in that?
Yeah. So, Zuvaa handles all
the returns for the customers.
So they get a return slip, and,
you know, they send the items
back to us in Atlanta,
and then we send those items
back to the designers
usually every quarter or so
to cut down on costs.
?You're getting $50K a month.
What does it cost you to run it?
You got some staff?
Yes. I mean, our burn,
monthly, is about $50K,
so we break even monthly.
Okay. So what's the vision for
why it's worth $4.6 million?
So, our valuation is really
just based
off of 2X multiple
of our GMV from last year.
Has anybody paid that value?
Is anybody invested in it?
No, we haven't had
any investment.
We've been bootstrapped
the whole three years.
?So you own 100% of it?
?I own 92%.
And who owns the other 8%?
My other advisers.
So I'm gonna guess right now
you're very flexible
on valuation.
Well, she's saying
that she's worth $4.6 million
right now, correct?
?Yes.
Greiner:
You're doing fantastic.
Mm?hmm.
So why do you need a Shark?
There's so much more that I want
to do with this company, right?
I want for us to be able
to really create global impact
and for people around the world
to see the beauty
of African fashion design
beyond just fashion, right?
I mean, there's home apparel,
there's art.
There's so much beauty
that's coming out of Africa,
so for us to really scale up,
we're going to need investment
to build out
a scalable online platform.
Right now, our online platform
does not meet the needs
of our vendors or our consumers.
What is the price?point range
for your outfits?
So, we range from $50 to $250.
That's not bad.
That's reasonably priced
for what this is.
?Yeah.
?It looks good.
You know, I think the mistake
in your deal,
just right out of the gate here,
$460,000 is a lot of money.
?Mm?hmm.
?But she's got to scale.
Yeah, but I'm having a hard time
at $4.6 million.
How many designers
do you want to grow to?
On the continent right now,
there are hundreds,
if not thousands of designers
who could do a variety of
pieces, right?
And that's what I'm really
looking to scale up to.
Look, I think what you've
accomplished is amazing.
Thank you.
But I can't get to where
you are with the valuation.
$460,000 is a big swallow
for 10%, and so I'm out.
Okay, thank you, Mark.
or was that real sales
to retail?
So, in 2015, we were fully
funded on Kickstarter.
In 2016, we prototyped it,
countless iterations.
And then, four months ago,
we fulfilled 25,000 units.
Any of the baby retailers
pick it up yet?
Yeah, so we are in Nordstrom
and Buy Buy Baby.
I wholesale at $5,
and I retail at $9.99.
And what does that amount to
in sales?
$117,000 for 2017, but ??
Okay, Nicki, let's address
this elephant in the room.
You know your valuation
is crazy.
[ Laughing ]
I hope not.
Why is it worth $5 million
right now?
$5 million, yes.
Okay.
Last year, I did a small
Friends and Family Round.
To Friends and Family
convertible note,
I did $433,000.
?There you go. Okay.
?What value was that at?
2.5.
We had yet to pass safety.
We had yet to engineer it
correctly
so that it would pop every
single time it came out.
Okay, so you found some suckers
for 2.5 to invest.
?No!
?Come on, now.
And then we had all this way
to de?risk it, right?
We had to go into production,
we had to get distribution
and warehousing and logistics,
and all that stuff worked out.
Now that, with our pipeline
that we're building,
then the interest
from retailers,
launching in other countries...
How do you know this is gonna be
a hit right now?
It's all lined up.
?I'm out.
?It is a hit.
I'm sorry.
We take affordable steps.
?I am out.
?Okay.
No, Nicki, it is a hit, and
it's, as a mom, it's a hit.
As a dad, it's a hit, too.
Okay.
As a future teller,
it sucks.
Come on!
I'd like to make you an offer,
and I'll go in
at the friendly and family round
value of $2.5 million.
So I'll do
the $250,000 at 10%.
Okay.
I don't agree that you've
doubled the value yet.
?So, what do you need from us?
?Money's not an issue, really.
Money doesn't seem
like it's your issue,
so I'm trying to get
to the heart of, like,
what can I offer you?
You're already in Nordstrom,
which is amazing.
I'm looking for that expertise
of, like, what's around
the corner
and how to build
a strong team.
What I hear you saying
is you want ??
you need an adviser
more than anything, okay?
So I've walked this road, I've
dealt in mostly female products.
Yes, which we are.
Most of the people that
work for me are mothers.
I'm a mother.
I'm gonna offer you
$250,000 for 15%.
Okay.
And the reason why I believe
it's 15% ??
I know he offered you 10% ??
but I have a website
that millions of women are
going to currently.
I can highlight you.
Okay.
She just grew a fin.
She's a Shark.
[ Laughter ]
?But I need a response.
?Yes!
So tell me ??
are we gonna ??
Would anyone else like
to make an offer
so that I don't leave
anyone out?
Are you saying
she's not good enough?
I'm up against Mr. Wonderful.
I can't loses to Mr. Wonderful.
Nicki, are you actually
thinking about this?
?Huh? Yes.
?So, Nicki, what is ??
what is your reservation?
Why are you holding?
I just want to make sure that
I don't leave anyone out.
