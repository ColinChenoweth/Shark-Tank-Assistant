for their patented car?seat
gap?filler, the Drop Stop.
Let's see what
they're up to now.
Newburger: Today, we're in
our hometown of Los Angeles,
meeting with the third?largest
police department
in the United States.
The department's been
testing Drop Stops
for the last three months,
and it's been a huge success.
Welcome to police headquarters.
Happy to be here.
Greiner:
I really respect policemen.
They risk their lives every day
to help protect us,
so we couldn't be more thrilled
to be helping
our everyday heroes.
What we want to do
is really decrease the number
of traffic collisions for all
officers and the public.
After three months, we've had
zero traffic?related accidents.
So we will be outfitting
3,000 of our police cars...
?Wow.
?...with Drop Stops.
Simon: People used to think
it was a joke
when we said Drop Stop
could actually reduce
driver distraction.
Now, to have this
police department
equip their vehicles
with Drop Stop,
it's a huge validation for why
we set out to do what we did.
We have a surprise
to present to y'all.
The very first glow?in?the?dark
Drop Stops.
Simon: The time has come
for Drop Stop
to become standard equipment
in every single vehicle.
You have seat belts,
you have an airbag.
Now it's time
to have a Drop Stop.
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Pat Hughes.
And I'm Mike Fox.
Our product is the Wingman,
and we're here today
seeking $200,000
in exchange for 12 1/2%
of our business.
We're friends
and business partners
from Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
and we spend a lot of time
on the water.
But there was always one thing
getting in our way.
Life jackets!
So we didn't wear them.
Why? Because foam life jackets
are bulky and inherently buoyant
while inflatable life jackets
are loose?fitting,
awkward, and not designed
for in?water activities.
Which is why
we created...
Both: The Wingman.
The Wingman is one of
the world's thinnest
and most versatile
life jackets
and the first designed
for in?water activitis
like swimming
and surfing.
So let's show you
how it works.
If you find yourself
in an emergency,
you simply pull down
on the ripcord...
[ Laughter ]
...the Wingman instantly floats
you face?up from any position,
and it can be used over and over
again with a new CO2.
By partnering
with the right Shark,
we can make the Wingman
the leader in water safety.
Saving one life would
make this product worthwhile,
but we know that we're gonna do
a lot better than that.
So, who wants to blow this
market out of the water?
[ Laughing ]
?Huh.
?All right.
?Wow!
?Can we try them on?
Oh, absolutely.
We got some samples for
you guys to touch, try out.
Yeah, they're loaded,
so feel free to blast it off.
Lori.
Mr. Wonderful.
Very cool.
Thank you.
And so, they are armed.
You just put them on,
fasten the straps
underneath your arm,
pull down on the ripcord
like your life depends on it.
Once you actually
trigger the Wingman,
is there a cartridge replacement
to make it inflatable again?
Yes, you can use it over
and over again
with a new CO2 cylinder.
[ Laughter ]
?Sorry.
?You have to buckle it.
Yeah. So you want to
buckle it underneath.
There you go.
?All right.
How do I get it
off now?
It doesn't come off 'cause
you didn't buckle it.
?Yeah.
?Oh, my God. I'm gonna ??
Oh, I can't get it off,
for real.
You look great in it.
You look great.
?Can you help me?
?You're not gonna drown,
but you're gonna strangle in it.
?Ah.
[ Loud pop ]
Aah!
?Whoa!
?Oh, my God!
Boom goes the dynamite!
[ Laughter ]
So, you want to fasten
the straps before you...
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
?Wow.
?Are you okay?
I participated
in my first triathlon.
And, sadly, during the race,
another participant drowned,
and I was saddened by how
preventable that tragedy seemed.
I thought, "There must be
some type of piece
of safety equipment that you
could wear in a race like this
where, if your mouth
is submerged for 30 seconds,
it knows that
and it deploys.
So that, to us, is the end?all,
be?all of water safety.
Right, right.
But you're a ways off from that.
Both: Yes.
But you believe
it's achievable?
Absolutely.
The first step was getting
a Coast Guard?approved vest
in the ideal configuration,
and so, for us,
this is it.
Okay. I think we get it.
Let's talk about revenue.
?[ Chuckles ]
?How much have you made so far?
Well, how much do they sell them
for, and what's your cost?
The retail price is $249.
Our landed cost is $65.
And in the past
10 months,
we've shipped
$120,000 worth of product.
So our bread?and?butter
customers so far are kayakers,
stand?up paddleboarders,
surfers, and fishermen.
O'Leary:
But the purchase of them
We have a U. S. patent granted
on this product, so...
?You have a utility patent?
?Utility patent granted.
?And it's published?
?And it covers what?
So, the unique things that
allowed us to make it sleeker.
So, for instance,
one of the big things
was moving that CO2 cylinder
to the back.
Also, in order to get this
lay?flat configuration,
we needed a new type
of zipper,
so we created this
triple?bursting zipper
that opens at both ends,
opens in the back,
so that's a big part
of our patent.
O'Leary:
And those attributes have merit,
but they don't change
the distribution problem.
The challenge is getting
this business
with a patented silicone
protective bubble
around the nipple,
so now every single time
you give your baby a Pop,
you simply pop it like this,
the baby takes over from there,
and every single
time they drop their pacifier,
what happens?
The nipple pops back
into a bubble,
keeping it clean
every single time.
Let's take a look at our babies.
Do you have a patent?
So, we have a fully issued
utility patent.
How much do each one of these
units cost to make?
So, I land for about $1.20.
