Hi, Sharks.
My name is Kelechi Anyadiegwa.
I'm from Atlanta, Georgia,
and I'm the founder and C. E. O.
of Zuvaa.
Today, I'm looking for $460,000
in exchange for 10%
of my company.
Growing up Nigerian,
I was always enamored
by unique prints and textiles.
The colors, the vibrancy ??
it always amazed me.
And I knew there were
talented designers
on the African continent
who had a gift for creating
beautiful pieces.
But the problem is, these
designers did not have the tools
nor the resources
to tap a global market.
This is why I created Zuvaa.
We are the fastest?growing
online marketplace
for global design.
We connect these incredibly
talented designers
with consumers globally who are
looking for unique finds.
Let me tell you how it works.
Consumers simply browse
our online marketplace
currently consisting over 85
handpicked, curated designers.
Once they've placed
their orders,
their items are shipped to them
directly from the designer
or from our fulfillment center
in Atlanta, Georgia.
Madison is wearing Titi's
Closet, and she is from Nigeria,
so it's a beautiful jumpsuit
with peplum on the sides
and on the top.
And then Michelle is wearing
a designer from Zambia.
And so she likes to mix
her prints
using wax prints and chiffons
in her materials.
And then, this designer's
also from Nigeria,
and this is
an all?chiffon material,
and so it's really beachy.
Now join me as we show the world
the beauty of Africa
through design.
I'd love to show you guys
some samples.
?Sure.
?Just to give you an idea of ??
?Please do!
?Oh, that's nice.
So, yeah, you can just kind of
pass them down.
I wanted you guys to see more
of the quality of the pieces.
Daymond, what you're holding
actually comes from Nigeria,
and it's made out of ashoké,
which is woven textile,
and that one comes from Benin,
and it's made with Ankara print,
wax print, and suede.
Could I wear this
at the pool?
That looks fabulous on you,
Mr. Wonderful.
I do wear wraps, you know.
I love that.
So, Kele, how do you
find these women?
So, we actually find it
by word of mouth.
And we also have a very strict
vetting policy,
so all designers
who are interested
in selling through Zuvaa,
they send us their samples.
And we're able to really check
quality control
as well as understanding
what their process is
for fulfillment
and customer service.
How did you come up
with his idea?
I'm a first?generation Nigerian.
This is my culture, right?
I grew up wearing these pieces.
I actually started Zuvaa
while I was in grad school.
I was at Carnegie?Mellon,
and during that time,
I start to freelance
in social?media marketing,
and people would ask me
all the time,
"Kelechi, where'd you get that?"
I realized how inaccessible
African prints and textiles
were to people
in Western markets.
?Right.
?So I started with
about a $500 investment,
and I was able to turn that
into over $2 million...
Whoa!
Kelechi,
I'm really proud of you.
?Thank you.
?I'm proud of what you've done.
You're an Atlanta girl.
You know, started Spanx
from Atlanta,
so it's a good place to start
something, for sure.
Um...
I'm ?? I'm also struggling
with your valuation.
?Okay.
?You don't say.
It's really high.
We're growing incredibly fast,
and if we do get the investment
from one of you Sharks,
we'll be able to use that
to grow even faster.
I feel like,
from what you've been able to do
so far on your own,
I'd count on you to keep going
without having to give up
a big chunk of equity
that I would need to ??
What chunk of equity
do you think that would be?
[ Inhales sharply ]
Like 50%.
?Cuban: Ha!
?O'Leary: Ouch.
Yippee?yi?yo ki?yay.
Okay. Yeah, I couldn't give up
50% of my company ??
definitely
not at such an early stage.
And I don't think
you should.
The more that you maintain
ownership,
the more you're gonna
be able to direct it
the way that you want to.
And so, for that reason,
I'm out.
Okay.
Okay, then.
You are making
a tremendous difference
in African women's lives.
I think you're doing
amazing all on your own.
I don't want to take
a chunk of your company,
and for that reason,
I'm out.
Thank you.
John: All right.
So here's my thoughts on it.
So, I had the honor of going
to Kenya
with President Obama
two years ago,
and believe it or not,
"Shark Tank" is big there.
You're like a lightning bolt
for entrepreneurship
because, in that continent,
literally,
women have carried the economy
on their heads and their backs.
Absolutely.
My biggest challenge is,
I'm a target.
A target?
In California,
there's a certain law
that anybody can walk up
to a product
that is being sold
in a public market,
and they can create
a class?action lawsuit.
Mm?hmm.
And dealing with 80 or 100
or 300 designers,
there's a lot
in that vetting process,
and I become almost a liability
for you.
A liability because there might
be an issue with the pieces?
?Because anybody can sue you.
?Yeah.
He's saying, because if
there's big pockets with you,
there might be a target.
?Absolutely.
I definitely want to be here
with you, but I'll be a target.
Okay.
I'm out.
Thank you, Daymond.
?Well, then...
?[ Laughs ]
The equity valuation
doesn't work,
and you heard it
from four Sharks.
Beautifully said...
?I didn't say that.
...wonderfully spoken,
all of that crap ??
at the end, they didn't
give you any money.
You know, I like
to deal in reality.
I hope you do, too, okay?
?Mm?hmm.
I don't think your company's
worth $460,000 right now.
The only way it works is
I loan it to you, all right?
?Okay.
?I give you debt.
I'll do it at 12%, all right?
I want 10% of the company
for providing that capital,
because you've at least proven
you have a business.
I'm impressed.
But the cold, hard reality is,
you asked for too much.
