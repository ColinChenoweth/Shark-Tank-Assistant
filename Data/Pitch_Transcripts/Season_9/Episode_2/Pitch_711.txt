Hello, Sharks.
My name is Christian Schauf.
Herjavec: Christian,
are you saying everything
on that board
is in here?
Yeah.
Yes.
Tell us some of the key safety
items that are in the bag.
This is a bit
of a transformer.
Everything works
to work together.
So there's not one thing
that really makes a difference.
It's having the right things
for whatever happens.
One of the things a lot
of people don't have is ??
is, like,
this is an even power ??
uh, power bank.
So that is a crank radio,
Schauf: I mean, yeah.
Well, maybe they do,
maybe they don't.
I don't want to get
into a bidding war with people.
I'd love to do business
with you.
$200,000 for 10%,
or you can move on
to the other Sharks.
I'm happy to sit out,
or I'm happy to do a deal
right now.
I mean,
that is very attractive to me.
I would just love to see
what everybody else has to say.
That is ?? That is right
what we're looking for.
?You have an exploding offer.
?I'm gonna go out.
Start dancing.
I'm gonna go out.

what I'm gonna say.
Okay, okay.

Oh, no!
Don't! Don't!
That just happened.
Yeah. Yeah.
?No! No! Listen to me!
?That just happened.
?That just happened.

Greiner: I was just gonna
give you an offer.
Thank you very much.
That was faster
than I thought.
I trained Robert well.
Oh, my God.
You have to go fa??
I'm sorry.
I had to make a decision.
I was trying to talk.
Cuban: Hey, guys,
in nine years,
that's the first time
he's been able to pull that off.
?I love your product.
?Thank you.
?Oh, my God.
?Thank you.
