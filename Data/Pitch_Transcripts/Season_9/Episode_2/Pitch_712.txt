Scott: But after Jackson's
first birthday,
he started to develop
some muscle weakness
that gradually spread
up his body.
He developed
some GI distress,
and he was crying
almost all the time.
We took Jackson to specialists
around the country
and still weren't able
to find any answers.
We made the large assumption
that it was something
inflammatory?based.
And by process
of elimination,
we found what helped Jackson
was more fats and less carbs.
He started sleeping
through the night.
He started gaining weight.
And then we knew we had stumbled
on something
critical
to his health.
Do you want to try it?
Jackson's finally received
a diagnosis.
He has a rare
autoimmune disease
called
Aicardi?Goutieres Syndrome.
And he's one of seven kids
in the world
with this variant
of this rare disorder.
Jackson!
Jackson!
Jackson!
Jackson!
Scott: Whether or not
we find a cure,
the one thing
we can be sure of
is that we're never,
ever going to give up.
Hi. I'm Megan Reamer.
And I'm her husband,
Scott.
We're here
from Crested Butte, Colorado.
We're asking
for $1.25 million
for 5% of our business
Jackson's Honest.
Yes, sir!
We are on a mission
to fundamentally disrupt
the $20 billion
snack?food industry.
We make the most delicious
potato and tortilla chips
cooked in 100% organic
coconut oil.
Coconut oil
is a super food
with a wide array
of health benefits.
It's a great source
of plant?based healthy fats.
It's easy to digest.
And it's a great oil
to cook with
because it's stable
when you heat it.
We learned a lot about the
benefits of coconut oil
when caring
for our son Jackson.
Jackson became very sick
with a rare disease,
and over many years
of trial and error,
we realized that a low?carb,
high?fat diet
really helped
his condition.
Coconut oil played
such a profoundly important role
in Jackson's diet
and our lives
that we started making
everything with it at home,
tortilla and potato chips
included.
And we'd give these chips
to our friends and family
and they all insisted that they
were the best they'd ever had
and, for years,
encouraged us to sell 'em.
So we did just that.
We founded Jackson's Honest
with the mission
to reintroduce this healthy fat
back to the snack aisle.
We're gonna
pass out samples.
?Oh.
?Oh, thank you.
I love chips.
Awesome.
All right. Lovely.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Here,
I'll give this to Barb.
Could you hand us
the packaging, too,
from any of them
so we get...
I have to say, these are
absolutely delicious.
Oh, my God.
Oh, thank you.
Blimey.
This is the best chip.
All I need is a beer.
[ Chuckles ]
Scott, is your background
in food?
No, it's not, actually.
[ Chuckles ]
You know, we ??
we made these
just to fill a need
in our house.
I have an undergraduate degree
in chemical engineering,
so I understood
at least some of the chemistry,
but the reality was
my position as a father
and Megan's as a mother
is what drove us to find this.
I remember when my son
was a year and a half old
and he needed to go
to the hospital
and they had
to do an operation with him,
and I realize I can't go in
with him.
I mean, to this day,
it is crystal clear
in my mind and my eyes.
Like, I ?? I see it
right here.
So I can imagine
that level of pain,
and then to churn that into
this incredible ??
not just story ??
but an actual company,
I mean, power to you.
Thank you.
Thank ?? thank you.
You have more courage
than I did...
Thank you.
...and that's very admirable.
Um...great packaging,
great branding.
That's my job in life ??
to make women cry.
[ Chuckles ]
Well...
Usually does it
for other reasons, but...
[ Laughter ]
'Scuse me, I'm sorry.
I, uh...
Don't apologize.
You know, it's just ??
it's...it's turning
something ??
like lemons into lemonade
and turning
this very difficult experience
into something
really positive.
Let me start by commending you
on a product
that is absolutely disrupting
the food and beverage base.
Thank you.
Thank you so much
for saying that.
I always look for stuff
that is breaking the mold
of what's out there today.
Everything out there
is high sugar, high fat ??
not the good stuff
that you need.
You're bringing
the good fats in.
So I'd like to change gears
a little bit now
because ??
to the finance component,
'cause you're here
for money...
Sure.
Sure.
...and my rudimentary
mathematics ??
I'm Indian, so it's actually
a little more than rudimentary.
We have to be good
at math.
Oh.
[ Laughs ]
Culturally, we have
to be good at math.
Wow.
So, this is
worth $25 million
is what you are valuing
the company at.
That's correct.
So that's a hefty valuation.
It is.
Walk me through that,
and how did you get there?
Tell us about the sales.
Last year,
it was $10.1 million.
?There you go.
?Wow.
What'd you do
the year before?
Year before
was $5.4 million.
And the year before?
And before that,
$1.4 million.
Are you profitable?
Not yet.
Okay,
how much are you losing?
We lost, last year,
about $1.7 million.
?Why is that?
?Whew.
Producing these chips ??
It's an expensive game.
Yeah. Food,
as a general rule of thumb,
is a difficult business
from a margin standpoint.
It takes a lot of money
to produce products.
What's your margin
on these?
But why were you losing
that much money last year?
Because we grew
so fast.
Yes.
So getting shelf space
is actually
quite an expensive endeavor.
?You paid slotting fees ??
?Uh, but that's okay.
?So...
?Well, hang on.
You got to explain that
to us.
But ?? but did you have
to pay slotting fees?
Scott: Sure.
But, in a natural channel,
it's not slotting fees,
it's free fill.
So we give away, literally,
cases of our product...
Greiner: Right.
...in order to gain
that shelf space.
What does that add
to your costs?
Last year,
it was about 18%...
Corcoran: That's huge.
...18.4% ?? very large.
That's huge.
So it's like giving
one out of five bags free
to stay in the door.
So, at what point,
do you become profitable?
Next year, actually.
Pretty soon, actually.
Really, we're really close.
Yes, we've got it
modeled out.
Where's the rest
of the costs?
Sure.
Like, I understand
the lower margin.
Look at me ?? I love the chips.
I've got all of ??
Yeah.
It's always better not to talk
with your mouth full.
Why don't you swallow first?
You got it
all over your face.
So, while he's chewing ??
guys, while he's chewing,
guys, how much money
have you raised,
if any, for this company?
We've ?? from friends
and family,
we've raised in equity
$3 million.
?Oh, wow.
?Whoo!
Wow.
So, how much of the company
do you still own?
Two?thirds.
Two?thirds, okay.
This year,
what's the forecast?
Uh, the ?? we have
between $13 million
and $14 million run rate
right now for this year.
So, run rate means you're doing
about $1 million a month?
$1 million ??
We just had our largest,
uh, month ever in May ??
$1.42 million.
Wow.
Oza: So, I was involved
in a ??
in a brand
called Popchips.
Yes.
And Popchips
had growth rates from ??
you know,
we did 1.4?ish to 4, 5,
so similar to you...
Yes.
...then we were at a 17...
Yes.
...and then we're at a 45.
Yeah.
So...
But how much did you spend
on marketing?
We spent a fair bit
on marketing,
but ?? but here I saw ??
I like the 1.45.
I like that to the 10.
Why am I not going
10 to 20 here?
Where's ??
why am I going 10 to 12, 13?
Frankly, we had to pump
the brakes a little bit.
Yes.
You know, there ??
you know,
this is a difficult business
to run.
Your biggest customer,
Whole Foods?
That's correct.
Correct.
So, of the $12 million,
$13 million expected to do
this year,
how big do you think
Whole Foods would be?
Whole Foods would be
approximately 13% of that.
?13%?
?13%?
That's it?
Doing only, um, $1.5 million
at Whole Foods three years in,
that number doesn't strike me
as exciting.
I'm concerned.
Whole Foods,
the number?one
natural player ??
what's going on here?
There are lots of
other competitors out there,
and frankly,
it's one of the risks here.
Herjavec:
Let me start things off.
At a $25 million valuation,
I see more risk
than opportunity.
Not for me. I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So, you know, I love chips,
but I'm the person
that buys the baked chips.
Yes.
Sorry. I'm out.
Understood.
Okay. Thank you.
Cuban: So, guys,
congratulations.
What you've been able
to accomplished is amazing.
All of us are entrepreneurs,
and we know the grind.
We want you to succeed,
but, you know,
the numbers matter.
And it's
a $25 million valuation ??
that's literally
how much you have to produce
in profits in order
to return my investment.
I don't see the margins
growing quick enough,
and so, for those reasons,
I'm out.
Megan and Scott, $1.25 million
is a lot of money,
and I feel that the amount of
equity that I'm getting for that
needs to be a lot higher.
But I also feel the value
I bring
will justify
what I'm asking for.
The 5% is way too low.
It needs to be more like 20%.
20%?
20%.
20%.
So he wants to take the
valuation from $25 million...
Sure. Exactly.
...to $6.25 million.
So let me explain a little bit
if you understand why...
Yeah.
...because every company
I've been involved in,
I was never the founder.
I'm just not that smart.
But what I am good at doing
is partnering
with really smart founders
with creative,
fantastic products
and exploding them.
You know what else
you're really good at?
Making lowball offers.
That's a very difficult offer
to entertain,
because we have done so much
in such a difficult space,
as you know.
It also means
when you raise your next round,
you have no equity left.
I?I?It...
Scott, make a counter.
Well, I...
What would you like to do?
How about $1.25 million
for 7.5%?
Scott: Rohan increases
the chances,
the probability that we're gonna
be a national brand
that everyone's gonna be
talking about.
I?I mean, I can't even explain
what that means to us
personally, as parents,
but also as entrepreneurs.
It's an incredibly
emotional moment.
