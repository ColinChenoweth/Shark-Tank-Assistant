Hello, Sharks.
My name is Christian Schauf.
And I'm Mike Escamilla.
We're asking for $100,000 in
exchange for 5% of our company
Uncharted Supply Company.
[ Rumbling ]
?Whoa!
?[ Laughs ]
?Oh, my God!
?Fancy Moses!
Oza: Shut the front door!
Is this the big one?
It was the big one.
Hopefully that was
the big one.
Sharks, our world ??
It's changing.
Emergency situations,
like earthquakes
and natural disasters,
are on the rise.
With growing population,
it's getting harder and harder
for first responders and
emergency personnel to keep up.
Schauf: That's true, and while
95% of all survival situations
are resolved in 72 hours,
what you do
in those first 72 hours
can be the difference
between life and death.
And we have a solution
for that.
We got to clean up
a little bit here.
I didn't like that picture,
anyways.
That's the way
I clean up, too.
[ Chuckles ]
Introducing the Seventy2.
Herjavec: Christian,
are you saying everything
on that board
is in here?
Yeah.
Yes.
Tell us some of the key safety
items that are in the bag.
This is a bit
of a transformer.
Everything works
to work together.
So there's not one thing
that really makes a difference.
It's having the right things
for whatever happens.
One of the things a lot
of people don't have is ??
is, like,
this is an even power ??
uh, power bank.
So that is a crank radio,
flashlight,
and it'll charge your cellphone.
What's your background?
I started the company.
I?I grew up on a dairy farm
in Wisconsin.
So I?I've lived
a life outside,
where you prepare
for the day,
and you take care of yourself,
right?
And I moved to L. A.
a few years ago
and it sprinkled one day
and the whole world stopped.
?L.A.'s very delicate.
?Oh, man.
This guy's from LA,
so he hates when I tell this,
but it's ?? this is where
the idea really came from.
[ Laughs ]
I?I thought if ??
if rain is gonna stop everybody
in their tracks, what happens
if an earthquake hits?
So I started researching
a product
that I thought
would protect me.
Everything on the market,
it's just not ??
The right thing
isn't there.
It's almost dangerous
because you think you're buying
something to prepare yourself,
and what's in there ??
Isn't gonna work.
It's not ??
It's not gonna work,
and even if it does work,
you don't know how to use it.
Right.
Especially ??
The good thing about this
is it has
all the directions printed
on how to use it,
what order to use in it,
color?coordinated
to the pockets inside
'cause, you know,
when it's an emergency happens,
it's ?? it's kind of frantic.
You know, it's gnarly.
Herjavec: I like the idea.
It's a great idea.
People never
think about bad crap happening
until bad crap happens.
Yeah.
Can you break out the numbers
for me?
What are your sales?
We started
about six months ago selling.
We've sold $700,000
so far.
?In six months?!
?In six months?!
?Wow.
?To 64 countries.
We did a crowdfunding campaign
to start.
How much did you do
in crowdfunding?
Uh, we did about $400,000
in the first month.
Wow.
And then we ?? Everything else
has been through our website.
Wow!
Give me an idea
of what yours costs
and what are the average ones
on the market.
So, we are
a little more expensive.
Ours is $350, okay?
That's not bad.
Um...
And what ??
And what do you make it for?
Our first round ??
They cost us $209 apiece to make
because we were really concerned
about making the right product.
Wow.
But in six months, we've gotten
that price down to $141.
?Oh, that's good.
?And we know we can do better.
So, you guys have got
to be making
a boatload of money,
right?
I think we're gonna make
$250,000, $300,000
this first year,
but I?I haven't taken a penny.
So you're making $300,000
in gross margin, basically.
Right.
We just bought 3,000 units.
Why so many units
at a time?
What's your lead time?
And where are you
making them?
We are, on the grand scale
of things,
a small player
with these big factories, right?
So the factories said, "We'll
have your product in 30 days."
It ended up being 90 days.
We assemble these
in the United States
at a company called PRAC
that hires handicapped people
and gives them jobs.
Oh, great.
So we found
a really cool solution there,
and we feel really good
about that.
I think you guys
are so authentic.
Thank you.
I mean, you're, like,
out of Central Casting.
Pick these guys ??
Barbara likes you
for other reasons, too.
Yeah, there's ??
[ Laughs ]
No, no, that's not true.
I know you might be
attracted to me,
but I am a married woman.
[ Laughter ]
?Just for the record.
?Yeah.
But I'm married to a guy
that has a fire extinguisher
in the four corners
of every room I live in.
So he's, like,
right on this kind of stuff.
He's really hoping
for doomsday.
I think I'm gonna buy one
for Bill
and let the other guys
take your deal.
I'm out.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Guys, I?I don't ??
I don't think you need
a lot more than the cash,
and I don't like being
dumb money.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Schauf: I mean, yeah.
Well, maybe they do,
maybe they don't.
I don't want to get
into a bidding war with people.
I'd love to do business
with you.
$200,000 for 10%,
or you can move on
to the other Sharks.
I'm happy to sit out,
or I'm happy to do a deal
right now.
I mean,
that is very attractive to me.
I would just love to see
what everybody else has to say.
That is ?? That is right
what we're looking for.
?You have an exploding offer.
?I'm gonna go out.
Start dancing.
I'm gonna go out.
Listen.
He's gonna go out.
Going once...
I ??
Going twice...
Christian?
I'm gonna tell you
what I'm gonna say.
Okay, okay.
?What?
?He took it! He took it!
I love your product
as much ??
We have a deal.
We have a deal.
$200,000 at 10%!
Oh, no!
Don't! Don't!
That just happened.
Yeah. Yeah.
?No! No! Listen to me!
?That just happened.
?That just happened.
?That just happened.
Greiner: I was just gonna
give you an offer.
Thank you very much.
That was faster
than I thought.
I trained Robert well.
Oh, my God.
You have to go fa??
I'm sorry.
I had to make a decision.
I was trying to talk.
Cuban: Hey, guys,
in nine years,
that's the first time
he's been able to pull that off.
?I love your product.
?Thank you.
?Oh, my God.
?Thank you.
