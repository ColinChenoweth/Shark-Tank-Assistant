Cox: Listen up, Sharks.
My name is Shane Cox.
I live
in Raleigh, North Carolina,
Cox: So the primary application
is actually for the classroom.
There's a lot of studies
that have been done
on acoustics
in the classroom.
So, as an adult,
if Mark's saying something
$52?
Have you sold any, Shane?
Yep. So year to date,
we've done $177,000.
?Well, that's great.
?All your sales are to schools?
Probably 90%.
We have some church groups,
we have some public speakers.
I'm a one?man show,
so all the sales ??
that $177,000 ??
that's me working trade shows.
That's...
Wow. Do you have a patent?
I do have a patent pending.
Um, it's all about ??
so...I don't know
if you noticed,
when I throw it, you don't
actually hear any noise.
So it's got sensors.
It knows
when it's being thrown
Wow.
Shane, it's amazing
what you're doing,
but you just gave the challenge
for the company.
How do you scale that?
I mean, how big do you think you
can be in two or three years?
Cox: I'm projecting,
by the end of the year,
we'll be about $650,000
in sales.
How are you gonna get from
$177,000 so far this year to...
So, it's ?? it's the schools
that have bought it,
so the first half
of the year,
these were all schools
that were saying,
"We're gonna buy one or two
of these to test it out,"
with a plan to buy
a lot more in the fall.
So in Texas, for example...
Of all those teachers
you sold one ball to,
What are you gonna
use the money for, Shane?
For me, it's inventory.
Right now, I haven't sold more
because I keep running out.
I haven't been able to do
a consistent marketing push,
'cause I get product,
it's gone,
All right, Shane.
Yes.
We're ready for you.
This is a big one,
buddy.
Cox: All right.
So, it's gonna be me
with Mark with Rohan.
The dream team.
$300,000 for 30%.
For 30%.
Shane, you have an offer.
Shane, this is gonna solve
all my problems.
?I?I'm ordering like...
?Congratulations.
Oza:
I'm ordering my thing.
30 for all my companies
right off the bat.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, seriously.
