Cox: Listen up, Sharks.
My name is Shane Cox.
I live
in Raleigh, North Carolina,
and I'm the creator
of the Qball.
Now, I'm here seeking
a $200,000 investment
in exchange for 15% equity
in my company.
And now, this is the Qball.
But it's not just
an ordinary ball.
It's actually
[echoing] a wireless microphone!
Oh, wow.
Oh, snap.
[ Normal voice ]
So, Qball is a fun...
Snap.
...and dynamic way
to engage
and interact with others.
You can toss it,
you can roll it,
and, yes,
you can drop this mic.
[ Chuckles ]
Which is why
it's the perfect tool
for the classroom.
Now, students absolutely love
the Qball
because it makes learning
both fun and interactive.
Teachers love it
because it helps them
manage classroom discussions,
because if you have
the ball,
then you have
the floor.
Most importantly,
we make sure that every student
can be heard.
But it's not just
for the classroom.
The next time
that you're at an event
and you want everybody to hear
that audience member's question,
just toss 'em a Qball.
Our system
is simple to set up
and works with anything
from pro audio systems
to plain, old
desktop speakers.
So tell me, Sharks ??
who's ready to get
the ball rolling with the Qball?
Mark's hands were up first,
so...
Greiner: [ Chuckles ]
Hello.
Herjavec: [ Chuckles ]
Bum, bum, bum.
So, what is it connected to?
Like, how does it ??
So, the way that it works is,
uh, is a little receiver here ??
comes with the system ??
and that connects
into your audio system.
It's just
a regular audio output,
so you could plug it into
the auxiliary input in your car,
you can plug it into,
like I said, desktop speakers.
?So, some speakers.
?Some sort of speakers.
Greiner: Do we get samples?
That's the only one
that's up and working,
but you can at least get the ??
the feel of it.
Thank you.
Herjavec: What's the main reason
I would buy this?
Cox: So the primary application
is actually for the classroom.
There's a lot of studies
that have been done
on acoustics
in the classroom.
So, as an adult,
if Mark's saying something
and I miss every third word,
I can fill in the blanks.
Kids, they don't fill
in the blanks.
Cognitive auditory processing
doesn't develop
until you're 15 years old.
Hmm.
How much does it cost?
What's the price of one?
So, it's $179
is the retail price on it.
Wow.
And what does it cost you
to make it?
So, it costs us $52 landed.
$52?
Have you sold any, Shane?
Yep. So year to date,
we've done $177,000.
?Well, that's great.
?All your sales are to schools?
Probably 90%.
We have some church groups,
we have some public speakers.
I'm a one?man show,
so all the sales ??
that $177,000 ??
that's me working trade shows.
That's...
Wow. Do you have a patent?
I do have a patent pending.
Um, it's all about ??
so...I don't know
if you noticed,
when I throw it, you don't
actually hear any noise.
So it's got sensors.
It knows
when it's being thrown
and it puts itself to sleep,
basically.
Clever.
I guess here's
where I'm struggling.
I think it's a great idea
for classrooms,
but short of calling
on every single school,
how do you sell
the entire state of California?
A lot of our growth
is grassroots ??
it's through the teachers ??
and that is part
of their persona.
They want to be known
as the techie teacher.
Cuban: You help brand
the teachers.
So they'll go and buy it
out of their own pocket.
Ahh.
They'll figure out
some way to pay for it.
It helps them.
Once it's in the classroom,
it grows on its own.
Wow.
Shane, it's amazing
what you're doing,
but you just gave the challenge
for the company.
How do you scale that?
I mean, how big do you think you
can be in two or three years?
Cox: I'm projecting,
by the end of the year,
we'll be about $650,000
in sales.
How are you gonna get from
$177,000 so far this year to...
So, it's ?? it's the schools
that have bought it,
so the first half
of the year,
these were all schools
that were saying,
"We're gonna buy one or two
of these to test it out,"
with a plan to buy
a lot more in the fall.
So in Texas, for example...
Of all those teachers
you sold one ball to,
how many have come back
and ordered more?
Yeah,
a big chunk of them.
It's not ??
it's not the teacher,
it's ?? I get calls back
from the school,
from the principal now
saying,
"Hey, one of my teachers
got these. I want more."
So, we have a
global cybersecurity company.
We really don't sell
to a lot of school boards
or governments because the
sales process is just so hard.
I'm gonna be old and gray
by the time this thing scales.
I'm sorry, I'm out.
What are you gonna
use the money for, Shane?
For me, it's inventory.
Right now, I haven't sold more
because I keep running out.
I haven't been able to do
a consistent marketing push,
'cause I get product,
it's gone,
and then I'm waiting ??
I've got to use that money
to buy the next batch,
I'm waiting for more to come in.
Well, here's my question ??
can you use it with a Polycom?
Yeah, so, it's ?? again,
it's just a standard audio out.
I can't stand
when I am sitting ??
and this is all day long ??
in a conference call
with people, and I'm like,
"Can you move close
to the Polycom?"
Uh?huh.
"I can't hear you.
I can't hear you."
?Yes.
?It drives me bonkers.
I see a huge corporate side
to this.
Every office should have this.
So instead of huddling
around the speakerphone...
Cuban: Have you done
any of that ?? Have you done
any corporate sales yet?
We've done a little bit.
We haven't really focused
anything in that area.
'Cause that seems like
a much bigger opportunity.
And a much easier sale.
I mean,
part of it was I ?? I...
Silicon Valley,
are you kidding me?
There's a lot of different
markets that we can do for this.
I just didn't want to go in
too many different directions.
I kind of love it.
I'm gonna make you an offer.
All right, Shane.
Yes.
We're ready for you.
This is a big one,
buddy.
Cox: All right.
So, it's gonna be me
with Mark with Rohan.
The dream team.
$300,000 for 30%.
For 30%.
Shane, you have an offer.
Shane, this is gonna solve
all my problems.
?I?I'm ordering like...
?Congratulations.
Oza:
I'm ordering my thing.
30 for all my companies
right off the bat.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, seriously.
?Get it branded.
?Seriously, brilliant.
Brilliant.
Congratulations.
[ Sighs ]
Oh, I can't believe it.
[ Chuckles ]
Lori.
Huh?
I get what you're gonna do
with it.
Yeah.
Mark, I get
what you're gonna do with it.
Rohan, you gonna create
a drink out of it?
Look, he's just jelly
'cause he ??
he dropped out...
He's just jelly.
...'cause all he saw
was education.
And we're, like, bro,
there's a much bigger picture.
Proud of you.
You're so smart.
No, I'm not.
You are!
You worked so hard.
Thanks, mom.
So proud of you.
All right.
Okay. All right.
Okay? We got this? Okay?
[ Both singing indistinctly ]
[ Laughing ] Okay.
All right, Mom.
All right, Mom.
[ Beeps ]
