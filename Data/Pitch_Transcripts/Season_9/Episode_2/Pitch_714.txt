Hello, Sharks.
My name is Ryan Diew,
Ryan, how many airports
do you have today?
We have four airports
up to this point ??
Ryan, are you still trying
to finish your burrito?
Yes.
[ Laughter ]
Ryan, how do you keep your
information always updated ??
the changes in restaurants,
particularly menu items,
pricing?
So, right now,
it's strictly just a description
of exactly what they sell.
So, for example,
if it's a bar,
it will be like, "They sell,
like, certain types of beer,"
but, like, it's not, like,
really as descriptive.
I'm sorry.
I still have this burrito.
?That's all right.
?You need some water?
Do you have some water
back there? Go ahead.
?Yeah.
?I don't have water back there.
So embarrassing.
Oh, there you go!
There you go.
Oh, my gosh, thank you.
Thank you, Eric.
Wow,
this is so embarrassing.
Ah, we've got time.
It's only the biggest moment
of your life
All right.
Ryan,
are you a student now?
Yes ?? well, I actually
just recently just graduated.
Do you have a job?
Congratulations.
Uh, actually I turned ??
I turned down
a couple jobs, opportunities.
Corcoran: Ryan,
let me ask you something ??
if, for example,
you were able to get $100,000...
Yes.
...here in the Tank,
what would you do
with that money?
My "A" priority is
to get a developer
that's better than me,
to be able
to parse flight itineraries,
to be able to load them
into our application.
That's a throwaway number,
Ryan.
Herjavec: Hey, Ryan,
don't say that.
Don't say you don't have
that rich uncle.
Don't ?? don't say that.
L?Look, my dad worked
in a factory,
my mom was
a receptionist.
You just got to deal with
the reality of what you have.
You got to be
more innovative.
That's the beauty
of being an entrepreneur ??
you get to create value.
Corcoran: Ryan, don't ??
don't feel discouraged
because there's nothing wrong
with you.
Yeah.
But what we have here
is not yet a business.
We have a confused model.
Ryan, you're lying to yourself
to think
that you're gonna be
so differentiated
that everybody's gonna
ignore iOS Maps
Ryan, you know what?
Stop patting yourself
on the back,
as much as the product.
I understand ??
Ryan.
No, I ??
You identified a need.
You've got to create
a real product
and a real business!
Ryan, go ahead
and prove us wrong.
Good luck, Ryan.
We wish you the best.
