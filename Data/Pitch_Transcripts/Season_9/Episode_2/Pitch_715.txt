Hello, Sharks.
My name is Ryan Diew,
and I'm the creator of Trippie,
the go?to app
for navigating big airports.
I'm seeking $100,000 in exchange
for 10% equity in my company.
Airports are confusing,
even for the most frequent
business traveler.
As a college student
from Oakland,
going to school back east
at Colgate,
and a former traveling
Division I basketball player,
I was always in the airport.
My typical airport experience
always went
a little something
like this ??
I'd have my carry?on bags...
[ Grunts ]
...I'd make my way
all the way to my gate,
then I want to grab a bite
to eat before my long flight,
but I had no idea
which way to turn for food.
And you ?? and you know
how it is ??
an airport directory
is literally never there
when you need it,
and who wants to travel
all the way up and down
the terminal
in search for something
that might not be there
in the first place?
So, sadly, what I had to do
a lot of the time
is settle for the
little newsstand by my gate
that was notorious for selling
nothing but bottled water
and a soggy, disgusting
tuna fish sandwich.
?Mm.
?[ Laughs ]
Little did I know that
my favorite Mexican food spot
was only a three?minute walk
away from my gate.
With Trippie,
I wouldn't have to settle
for this disgusting, nasty
tuna fish sandwich.
Greiner: Oh!
Cuban: Oh! There goes
that basketball career.
[ Laughter ]
Corcoran: Great.
So I started Trippie.
I'm sorry.
Instead, I'd be able to eat the
sumptuous burrito of my dreams.
Herjavec: Yeah.
Trippie takes the guesswork
and turbulence
out of navigating big airports.
Now let me show you
how it works.
Great.
So, you're able
to select an airport.
So, let's select
Shark Tank International.
As you can see, you can get
a list of all the restaurants...
Greiner: [ Laughing ]
Kevin O'Leary Fish.
So, right now,
let's, uh, select,
uh...Shark Tank Diner.
All right.
This is ??
at the Shark Tank Diner,
it's only a minute,
108 feet away.
Where ??
where deals are made.
The top dish
is the Mr. Wonderful Special...
Oza: Ugh, really?
...which features
extreme dilution.
That place is probably closed
by now.
[ Laughter ]
It went out of business.
Food safety.
And so, now, you can see
where you are currently
in the airport and it shows
that that little blue dot
is your location
and it can guide you
all the way to your destination.
With the arrival of Trippie
means the departure
of your airport stress.
[ Laughs ]
So, we need your help
in order to get Trippie
in the hands of millions
of jet?setters worldwide.
Thank you.
Ryan, how many airports
do you have today?
We have four airports
up to this point ??
San Francisco, Atlanta,
Chicago O'Hare, and Toronto.
So, ever since
I graduated three weeks ago,
we actually expanded.
Right now,
we're in nine airports, so...
Ryan, are you still trying
to finish your burrito?
Yes.
[ Laughter ]
Go ahead and swallow.
Thank you.
Take a minute.
Swallow, and then keep going.
Ryan, how do you keep your
information always updated ??
the changes in restaurants,
particularly menu items,
pricing?
So, right now,
it's strictly just a description
of exactly what they sell.
So, for example,
if it's a bar,
it will be like, "They sell,
like, certain types of beer,"
but, like, it's not, like,
really as descriptive.
I'm sorry.
I still have this burrito.
?That's all right.
?You need some water?
Do you have some water
back there? Go ahead.
?Yeah.
?I don't have water back there.
So embarrassing.
Oh, there you go!
There you go.
Oh, my gosh, thank you.
Thank you, Eric.
Wow,
this is so embarrassing.
Ah, we've got time.
It's only the biggest moment
of your life
and you're choking
on a burrito!
But what else could go wrong?
You're literally choking
in the presence...
?What else could happen?
?Welcome back.
Yeah.
Thank you. Thank you.
All right.
Ryan,
are you a student now?
Yes ?? well, I actually
just recently just graduated.
Do you have a job?
Congratulations.
Uh, actually I turned ??
I turned down
a couple jobs, opportunities.
I turned down interviews
from Facebook and Google.
I was my school's
Google Student Ambassador.
How do you make money
today?
What do you do
for a living?
So, right now,
this is all that I do.
I'm ?? I literally, like ??
like ??
like can't go two seconds
without thinking about this.
You live at home?
And so, yeah,
I live at home
with my parents.
Who ?? who coded it?
Wait, wait, so...
I?I'm the ?? I'm the sole
iOS developer for this app.
Good for you.
Good for you.
Oza: Yes.
Oh, good for you, yeah.
How long ago
did you upload it?
So, I uploaded it to the ??
to the App Store ??
App Store in October.
Do you have
any customers?
Yes.
Right now we have only ??
we ?? we have
about 850 downloads
with 160 monthly
active users.
Okay, so, there are other apps
that do this?
Yes.
Right?
So, tell ??
Well, so ?? similar.
Who cares
about the competitors?
Why are you better?
So, basically,
why we're better
is the fact
that our main goal
is not right now trying
to be an airport directory.
Our main goal is to actually
connect air travelers
within the airport, kind of like
a Waze of the indoor space.
So being able
to connect travelers
who are being able to, like ??
TSA wait times.
That's completely different.
?Yeah, that's ??
?I mean, that's ??
But isn't Google Maps
doing a lot of that?
Well, the thing is ??
Google Maps
has your destination stuff...
Yes.
...where it will
literally track
where you walk
in the airport.
Yes. W?We actually use ??
we're actually using
the Google Maps API.
The thing that, like,
differentiates us
between us and Google Maps
is the fact that we're trying
to make a?a community
of travelers that basically
are able
to communicate
with one another.
Corcoran: Ryan,
let me ask you something ??
if, for example,
you were able to get $100,000...
Yes.
...here in the Tank,
what would you do
with that money?
My "A" priority is
to get a developer
that's better than me,
to be able
to parse flight itineraries,
to be able to load them
into our application.
Wow.
And since I graduated,
our monthly active users
have jumped by 40%.
To what? How many?
169 monthly actives.
Th?That's ??
That's a throwaway number,
Ryan.
I understand ??
I understand that it's a ??
it's very low.
Are you plugged in some
kind of a back end system ??
a directory
within the airports?
No, we do not.
Oza: And are you adding
manually,
like someone goes there
and gets this data?
How are you getting
the information?
So, basically,
I?I work with my ?? my brother
who basically helps me with
data aggregation from hours ??
From public websites
and things.
Online.
Exactly, from hours, reviews,
all these things,
and aggregating that
into our back end ??
?That's tough.
?And...
Trying to aggregate that data
essentially manually...
Mm?hmm.
It's manually.
That's hard.
It is.
Why not tie into
the back end airport systems?
Well, because we don't have
connections in the ??
We ?? I haven't reached out
to the airports.
Greiner: You know,
you said something
that I thought
was quite brilliant.
You said you want
to become the Waze for airports.
I personally think,
if you could,
the biggest problem
ever in airports
is not knowing what
that line's gonna be like...
Security.
...when you get there.
Mm?hmm.
That would be
an amazing home run.
The reason why I didn't come
in here pitching that,
because we don't have
that functionality
in the application yet.
I have a lot of ideas
of where ??
where to take
this application.
No, I totally get that.
I?I...yes.
I feel your mind
is brilliant,
and you can get there,
but for me,
I like to know something
is already even in the works.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Herjavec: Hey, Ryan,
don't say that.
Don't say you don't have
that rich uncle.
Don't ?? don't say that.
L?Look, my dad worked
in a factory,
my mom was
a receptionist.
You just got to deal with
the reality of what you have.
You got to be
more innovative.
That's the beauty
of being an entrepreneur ??
you get to create value.
And then, like ??
and what would ??
Go with what you have.
Don't look at
what you don't have.
The problem with the app
that I see
is there's nothing proprietary
about it.
There's no competitive advantage
to it.
But right now, I haven't had
the opportunity to really...
I don't want to quash
your enthusiasm,
but I'm out.
Oza: A?And I?I would add
to that ??
look, you ?? you have smarts,
you have passion.
I think that even if you hadn't
had a ton of downloads,
even if you'd come and said,
"Look, guys, I have a product.
I haven't gone
out there yet,
but the product has
something proprietary to it,"
I would be open
to that.
My problem is,
at the moment,
the money you need
is to get to the product
that's necessary...
Right.
...so for that reason,
I'm also out.
Corcoran: Ryan, don't ??
don't feel discouraged
because there's nothing wrong
with you.
Yeah.
But what we have here
is not yet a business.
We have a confused model.
So it's too early to come in
and ask for an investment.
I'm out.
Ryan, you're lying to yourself
to think
that you're gonna be
so differentiated
that everybody's gonna
ignore iOS Maps
and Google Maps
and come to you.
I'm so?? I'm sorry.
I get this is hard.
It's hard
to be an entrepreneur.
I'm saying this to you
to try to help.
The one mistake
almost every entrepreneur makes
that we have to overcome
is we lie to ourselves.
We tell ourselves
that it's a great idea.
The problem with your idea
is it's a feature,
not a product.
I hope you get there,
but I'm out.
I wish you the best, bud.
Thank you.
Good luck.
Good luck.
Hold on, hold on, hold on,
hold on.
I just have to say
one thing.
Hold on, hold on, hold on,
hold on.
I just have to say
one thing.
I know, like ??
I put my blood, sweat,
and tears into this.
I have done this while being
a?a college basketball player,
while being a ?? b?being
a full?time
computer science major,
a student,
a?a?a leader on campus ??
all these things,
I've been able
to do all this
in the back
of the bus on the ??
after away games.
When we were traveling
back from D. C.,
I'm coding.
In the airport before games,
I'm coding.
Ryan, you know what?
Stop patting yourself
on the back,
and stop feeling sorry
for yourself.
I've spent 36 hours straight
coding,
teaching myself
different langua??
so has Robert,
so has Barbara.
It's part of the deal!
Accept that hard work,
struggle, and sacrifice
is part of being
an entrepreneur!
Don't feel sorry for yourself!
Go get the job done!
I'm not patting myself
on the back.
I'm just telling you my ??
I'm telling you my story.
You're gonna go
in the real world!
It's about investing
in the entrepreneur.
It's about investing
in the entrepreneur
as much as the product.
I understand ??
Ryan.
No, I ??
You identified a need.
You've got to create
a real product
and a real business!
Ryan, go ahead
and prove us wrong.
You know how many times I've
been called wrong and an idiot?
And every single one
of those times,
it's maybe hundreds of millions
if not billions of dollars.
?Right.
?You just got to go prove it.
?I guess what ??
?But you have to have a product
before you can do that.
Good luck, Ryan.
We wish you the best.
