Marquez: I grew up
in Vallejo, California,
a pretty challenging
neighborhood.
My father
was a single parent
who hustled
day in and day out
to provide
for my sister and I.
I stayed active and out
of trouble by playing sports.
My father was my coach
who pushed me
to be the best person
I could.
Ondrea:
Marquez and I met online,
and fitness
is one of the things
that really
brought us together.
When we first met,
we loved going for hikes,
going for runs.
We really bond
over staying active.
One day, I was on the bike
looking at my phone,
looking at food.
An idea popped up.
Let's making something
not healthy, healthy.
Two months later,
we rented a commercial kitchen,
got engaged.
Oh, you're such
a good boy.
And we're new parents.
We just welcomed our baby boy,
Mason, to the world.
Marquez and I have both
given up our careers,
and we've really put
everything on the line for this.
We were able to bring Marquez's
dad on full?time, as well.
Owning our own business
can be really scary
and challenging
with a new baby,
but we know
that we're doing this
for the right reasons ??
for our family.
My name is Ondrea.
And my name
is Marquez.
We're from the Bay Area
in Northern California,
and our company
is called...
The Dough Bar.    The Dough Bar.
We are seeking $300,000
for 15% equity in our company.
Sharks, what do you think
you would look like
if you ate doughnuts
every day?
[ Cuban laughs ]
What if I told you
that you could eat
our Dough Bar doughnuts
every single day
and look like this?
Oh!
Corcoran:
Oh, my God!
Oh!
[ Laughter ]
Whoo!
Holy God.
Marquez:
All right.
Oh, my God.
Herjavec: Thank you.
And what's that?
Ondrea: Yeah, help yourselves
to this.
This is a box
of our doughnuts.
Thank you, sir.
So you have two doughnuts.
They're freshly glazed,
already prepped for you.
Thank you,
dear.
You're welcome.
[ Laughter ]
Marquez: So you have
two of our top sellers.
We have our apple?pie doughnut,
as well as
our cookie?butter doughnut
topped with chocolate crackers.
Oh!
Corcoran: Mmm.
Rodriguez: Mmm.
Oh, my God.
Wow.
So one question
we want you to ask yourself is,
"Would you rather have
a protein bar or one of these?"
How many calories?
So, with the doughnut glaze,
it's about 200 calories.
The doughnut itself
is 150 calories.
It's very tasty.
Marquez: Awesome.
It's chewy,
which I like.
It reminds me
almost of a cross between
a bagel
and a doughnut.
Yes.
Well?said.
Do you sell them
without the glaze?
Marquez: So,
part of the beauty is
we send our doughnuts to you
packaged individually plain.
If you open up
those sample boxes there,
that's how our customers
get the doughnuts.
Oh,
so they come plain.
So they all come
like this.
Both: Exactly.
Then you
drizzle yourself.
Both: Exactly.
How long does this last
in the freezer?
So, typically,
we tell our customers
when they receive
their doughnuts,
you store it in the fridge
for up to four or five days
if you're gonna eat them
within that time period.
Otherwise,
they're good for ??
No way this is making it
to a freezer.
You'll eat it
before then.
[ Laughter ]
Marquez: Exactly.
Herjavec: Well, you've sold us
on the taste.
Sell us on the numbers.
What does this cost?
All right.
Our average price
for one box of four is $15.50.
Wow.
Is that a lot?
That's an
expensive doughnut.
It's a lot.
Marquez: Well, if you
compare it to a protein bar
with the similar protein count
is anywhere from $2 to $4.
How much does it cost
for shipping?
So, we charge $5.99 to $8.99
all across the country.
All right,
so about $20, it gets to me.
Ondrea: Yes.
Correct.
What's your cost
on that box?
So, the box
actually costs us about $7.30.
We make about
a 53% margin right now.
Okay,
so it tastes amazing.
Tell us about
your sales.
So,
lifetime sales,
we're super excited to say
we hit $1.2 million,
and this is from
June 10th of 2015 to today.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
$1.2 million
of doughnuts.
$1.2 million in doughnuts.
Over 280,000 doughnuts sold.
In two years?
Ondrea: Yes.
Cuban: So, where are
you selling them?
So, we sell direct to consumer
all online.
Straight from
your own website or ??
Correct.
Herjavec: What will
your sales be this year?
So we're expected to break
$1 million this year and ??
Why?
What's happening?
Yeah. What is happening?
What's going on?
Ondrea: [ Chuckles ]
Well, I have to ??
So you guys are great
at SEO, basically.
Yes.
Yeah, I have to
give him the credit.
Like, we ?? he's built up
our social media,
and he's made
great relationships
with really great athletes.
And that's helped us a lot
get our name out there.
What percentage of your sales
are repeat orders?
So, this year, we have
a 31% customer returning.
That's remarkable.
Rodriguez:
Good for you.
Sorry. Are you making it
in a commercial kitchen?
Marquez: So...
We have
a co?packer, actually.
Um, when we started
the business, you know,
two years ago,
Marquez and I were
spending a lot of time
on the weekends,
14?, 16?hour days
with his father
making
the doughnuts ourselves.
Marquez, um,
is actually a nurse
and a
respiratory therapist,
but he left the hospital
to do this full?time.
Love it.
Rodriguez: So, how do you go
from that field
to a protein doughnut?
So, I grew up in
a?a pretty rough neighborhood.
My father was a single parent
and worked really hard
to just really grind and
put food on the table for us.
And so I've always known that
I wanted to be an entrepreneur
and take care
of my family.
So literally,
we were at the gym one day,
and then a light bulb
just went off.
"Hey, what if we make
healthy doughnuts?"
And the next day, we went out
and bought all the stuff,
and we were acting like
mad scientists making doughnuts.
Wow.
Herjavec: What do you
need the money for?
So, we want to increase
our marketing spend.
We're currently
at a 5X return
on ad spend
with our paid advertisement.
In addition, we feel we can
definitely get our shelf life
of our doughnuts to about
three weeks to four weeks,
which will then, in turn,
decrease shipping costs,
allowing more people
to purchase our doughnuts.
What's next?
H?How do you exit this?
So, you know,
we feel that next year,
we can break $4 million
with our doughnut sale??
$4 million?
Greiner:
Based on what?
Um, decreasing
our shipping costs
will allow
a lot more people,
as well as
our gluten?free cake doughnut.
That's something
that we feel
will really
open up the market
to the
gluten?free community.
We also have a protein
Rice Krispie treat.
Oh.
That is actually
really close to launch.
Great.
So that will easily
take us ??
So you think you're gonna expand
the product lines,
it's gonna bring in
more customers.
I?I worry about
the price point.
Barbara, when you had
that cake company
that shipped cakes ??
It's not ??
Wait, wait.
It's not
"that cake company."
[ Both laugh ]
It's Daisy Cakes.
I forgot their name.
Sorry.
Okay.
How much was
a Daisy Cake cost?
$49.95
and $18 shipping.
Oh, wow.
And you would think
that would be a hindrance
to selling those cakes,
but they're so damn good.
Marquez: Yes.
Okay.
Maybe price
isn't a problem.
No, this is
a well?priced product.
Thank you.
And the fact that you have
a 30% reorder rate...
Correct.
...that's phenomenal
in the online?food business.
Thank you.
It means
that people really like it.
So, Ondrea and Marquez, when
the Sharks are quiet like this,
they usually
smell blood in the water.
While the Sharks
are all circling,
I'd like
to make you an offer.
Okay.                      Okay.
And I'm gonna tell you
why I like you
and why I think
I can help you enormously.
I love the fact that
you bootstrapped your business.
We don't
hear it enough anymore.
You have
such a happy relationship.
It's bouncing off
your skin.
Happy partners
make money together.
And you can't deny that,
right?
I'd like to offer you
the $300,000 for 30%.
Thank you, Barbara.
You're happy
to entertain other offers.
I don't mind that
at all.
But I just wanted
to get that out there.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Greiner: I'll share with you
my thought.
I look at this,
and it's right in my space
for two reasons.
One,
because of Bantam Bagel.
Two, because I really like
healthy foods,
so I've always been
that person
looking for
the healthier alternative,
and this was
really delicious.
Awesome.
I think I actually like it
better than a real doughnut.
Wow.
Whoo?hoo!
[ Chuckles ]
Thank you.
Thank you.
So, I'm gonna
make you an offer.
I'm gonna give you
$300,000 for 20%.
Okay.
Ooh.
Cuban: Guys, I see this
as a nice product.
Portion size are small enough
to keep the calories down.
But once you add all the junk
on it, it's still junk, right?
But where I'll give you credit
is your marketing's phenomenal.
Thank you.
So you turned it into
a great business,
but as a single product
I don't really believe in
makes it tough.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you,
Mark.
Um...
I?I?I love it.
I?I don't know if I want
to compete at $300,000 for 20%.
I think
that's a pretty good offer.
I think you've got
two Sharks
that seem to be far more
passionate about it than I do,
and I see a different direction
for it.
So, uh,
I'm gonna clear the deck.
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
Okay. Thank you.
Rodriguez: So let me
first of all say
that I love to do business
with people who have a PhD.
Mm?hmm.
And I don't mean
from Harvard or Yale.
I mean "poor, hungry,
and driven."
And both of you have that,
so I love that.
Thank you.
Thank you.
In 1994,
I entered the league
as an 18?year?old baseball
player for the Seattle Mariners.
In the clubhouse,
Kentucky Fried Chicken,
Burger King, McDonald's.
Players were eating this
45 minutes before game time.
Today ??
Corcoran:
Before a game?
Come on.
Before the game,
right?
Wow.
Today, we have brown rice,
sweet potato, vegetables.
The game has changed
tremendously.
Yes.
So I think
there's a lot of white space,
a lot of opportunity for you
in the sports world.
I'm also in the business
of gyms and fitness.
I own part of 1,000 gyms
in 20 countries.
So, I think, um, with that,
I'm gonna make you an offer.
Okay.
If Lori's up for it, uh,
I'm gonna make you an offer
for $400,000 for, uh, 30%,
and I will share it with Lori
if she accepts.
I would do
that deal.
Herjavec: Ooh.
Cuban:
But would they?
That's a lot of equity.
Ondrea and Marquez
have two offers
for their high?protein
doughnut company, The Dough Bar.
Barbara has offered $300,000
for 30%,
while Alex and Lori have teamed
up to offer $400,000 for 30%.
Corcoran:
Marquez and Ondrea,
I just want to say something
that I'll point out
out of experience here
on "Shark Tank."
Uh, it sounds lovely
and exciting
when you have two Sharks
swimming side by side,
but my practical experience is
that I prefer to do deals alone,
no matter how capable
my fellow Sharks might be,
because every decision
is made quickly.
I can't stand inefficiency,
and I suspect
you wouldn't have gotten
to where you were
if you were inefficient.
It sounds to me like
you think fast on your feet ??
Well, that's not
a fair thing to say.
You make decisions ??
Yes, it is.
No, it's not.
Definitely it's fair to say.
By the way, Lori and I
have done deals before,
and we're great partners
and we work very well together.
Yes, yes, yes.
Yes, he handles one area,
I handle another.
And, I mean,
I'm hands?on.
I do everything.
I'm there
for my entrepreneurs.
You know what? I'll drop down
to 25% to compete.
Herjavec: Yes!
Just ??
And I'm gonna tell you why
because I just feel in my gut
you belong with me.
I know that sounds sappy,
but you're my kind of people.
And even though Lori's
spinning out a good web there,
the truth of the matter is,
you're not her kind of people.
You're my kind of people.
Come to mama.
[ Gasps ]
That's a horrible thing
to say!
I know
it's a horrible thing.
Excuse me, but Alex and I
will drop down ours.
Just because ??
Cuban: Oh?ho!
Just because ??
[ Laughter ]
That's not
a right thing to do.
Alex, what should we do
about what Barbara just did?
I?I do think
that 30's the number for me
and is really non?negotiable,
and I'll tell you why.
I think we're gonna build
a monster for you,
and we're gonna tell you
how to do it.
They don't need your
help building a monster.
Like Lori said ??
Like Lori said ??
They're building
their own monster.
Ondrea: Okay.
You thinking?
Yeah,
go for it.
Barbara,
thank you for your offer.
That doesn't sound good.
And, uh, think about my father
and Mason and Ondrea.
So we're excited.
We're excited
to get this thing going
and really take it ??
take off to another level.
Yeah.
