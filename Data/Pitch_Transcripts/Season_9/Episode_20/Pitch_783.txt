Marquez: I grew up
in Vallejo, California,
a pretty challenging
neighborhood.
My father
was a single parent
We were able to bring Marquez's
dad on full?time, as well.
Owning our own business
can be really scary
Marquez:
All right.
Oh, my God.
Herjavec: Thank you.
Ondrea: Yeah, help yourselves
to this.
This is a box
of our doughnuts.
Thank you, sir.
So you have two doughnuts.
They're freshly glazed,
already prepped for you.
Thank you,
dear.
You're welcome.
[ Laughter ]
Marquez: So you have
two of our top sellers.
We have our apple?pie doughnut,
as well as
our cookie?butter doughnut
topped with chocolate crackers.
Oh!
Corcoran: Mmm.
Rodriguez: Mmm.
Oh, my God.
Wow.
So one question
we want you to ask yourself is,
"Would you rather have
a protein bar or one of these?"
How many calories?
So, with the doughnut glaze,
it's about 200 calories.
The doughnut itself
is 150 calories.
It's very tasty.
Marquez: Awesome.
It's chewy,
which I like.
It reminds me
almost of a cross between
Marquez: So,
part of the beauty is
we send our doughnuts to you
packaged individually plain.
If you open up
those sample boxes there,
that's how our customers
get the doughnuts.
Oh,
so they come plain.
So they all come
like this.
Both: Exactly.
Then you
drizzle yourself.
Both: Exactly.
How long does this last
in the freezer?
So, typically,
we tell our customers
when they receive
their doughnuts,
you store it in the fridge
for up to four or five days
if you're gonna eat them
within that time period.
Otherwise,
they're good for ??
No way this is making it
to a freezer.
You'll eat it
before then.
[ Laughter ]
Marquez: Exactly.
Herjavec: Well, you've sold us
on the taste.
Sell us on the numbers.
What does this cost?
All right.
Our average price
for one box of four is $15.50.
Wow.
Is that a lot?
That's an
expensive doughnut.
It's a lot.
Marquez: Well, if you
compare it to a protein bar
with the similar protein count
is anywhere from $2 to $4.
How much does it cost
for shipping?
So, we charge $5.99 to $8.99
all across the country.
All right,
so about $20, it gets to me.
Ondrea: Yes.
Correct.
What's your cost
on that box?
So, the box
actually costs us about $7.30.
We make about
a 53% margin right now.
Okay,
so it tastes amazing.
Tell us about
your sales.
So,
lifetime sales,
we're super excited to say
we hit $1.2 million,
In two years?
Ondrea: Yes.
Cuban: So, where are
you selling them?
So, we sell direct to consumer
all online.
Straight from
your own website or ??
Correct.
Herjavec: What will
your sales be this year?
Ondrea: [ Chuckles ]
Well, I have to ??
So you guys are great
at SEO, basically.
Yes.
Yeah, I have to
give him the credit.
Like, we ?? he's built up
our social media,
Sorry. Are you making it
in a commercial kitchen?
Marquez: So...
We have
a co?packer, actually.
Um, when we started
the business, you know,
Marquez, um,
is actually a nurse
Marquez: Yes.
Okay.
Maybe price
isn't a problem.
No, this is
a well?priced product.
Thank you.
Ondrea: Okay.
You thinking?
Yeah,
go for it.
Barbara,
thank you for your offer.
That doesn't sound good.
