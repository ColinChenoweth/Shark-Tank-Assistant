I'm Wendell Hunter,
former linebacker, Cal.
I'm Wale Forrester,
former DB, Cal.
And I'm Justin Forsett,
former running back, Cal.
We're from Berkeley, California,
and our company, ShowerPill,
is seeking
a $300,000 investment
for a 10% stake
in our company.
Sharks,
we're gonna let you in
on a little
locker?room secret.
But please, can you just
keep it between us?
You see,
more athletes than you imagine
don't shower
directly after
a sweat?drenched workout
or practice,
and we,
three athletes
who take great pride
in health and fitness,
have been guilty of the same
stinky and unhygienic offense
more times
than we like to admit.
Instead of telling you how
a ShowerPill Body Wipe works,
we're gonna show you
with a little help
from former UFC champion
Miesha "Cupcake" Tate.
Whoo!
[ Laughter ]
See,
all Miesha has to do
is pull out one extra thick
individually wrapped wipe,
which,
oh, by the way,
doesn't have any parabens,
sulfates, or alcohol,
and simply wipe down
from head to toe.
That's it.
Now Miesha is ShowerPill fresh
and ready to get dressed.
She can be on her way
with confidence
knowing that she won't have
any post?workout B. O.
or spread any of those nasty
sweat?related germs.
Miesha,
are you ready?
Miesha: Almost.
[ Laughter ]
Herjavec: Ta?da!
[ Laughter ]
So say, Sharks,
why don't you come and join us
and be a part...
Oh, I like that.
...of the active care
revolution?
Shower to the people.
Shower to the people.
Shower to the people.
[ Laughs ]
"Shower to the people."
That's great.
Wow.
Forrester: Miesha's gonna pass
around some awesome samples.
Oh,
thank you.
I'm gonna
give Lori hers.
Thank you.
So, we've created something
that will nourish
and cleanse your skin
at the same time.
Corcoran:
Thanks, Miesha.
So, did you do any
skin?sensitivity testing?
Oh, yes.
Have you been through
all of that?
Definitely.
It's hypoallergenic,
pH balanced,
because I suffer from eczema,
so we made the product
for ourselves.
And, Miesha, thank you.
She has to catch a flight.
This was
her ShowerPill moment.
[ Laughs ]
We really appreciate you.
Cuban: Thanks, Miesha.
Bye. Thank you.
Did you all play Cal
at the same time?
Forrester: We did.
Yes.
We all played together.
And did any of you all play
after ?? after Cal?
Forrester: Yes.
Yes.
I'm a former
nine?year NFL veteran.
I just retired
three months ago.
Congrats.
Pro Bowl running back.
Wow.
What team?
Uh, mostly notably, Baltimore
Ravens and the Seattle Seahawks.
There you go.
Very cool, man.
And he played, too,
as well.
Not quite as notable,
but what I can say
is that I played two years
for the Buffalo Bills.
Cool.
Forrester: And ??
And I was the bench warmer,
and, uh, I took my talents
to the Oakland Fire Department,
where I'm a lieutenant of fire
for the past 10 years.
Good for you.
Good for you.
That's great.
Well?done.
So I have a question.
What does one cost?
99 cents.
Forrester:
A retail is 99 cent.
It costs us 14 cents
to make.
It costs you 14 cents,
and you sell them for 99.
Yeah,
a box of 10 for $9.99.
And then do you sell a box ??
Okay, a box of 10 is $9.99.
Now, do you have
any sales?
Hunter: Yes.
Since 2014, we've had almost
100% year over year growth
the last three years.
And what is
that number?
What are
those numbers?
Yeah,
what are the sales?
Okay, yeah, last year,
we did almost $300,000.
This year,
we're on pace
to hit 100% this year,
as well.
Next year,
we'll do $2 million,
and the year after that,
we'll do $5 million.
And what's gonna make you jump
from $300,000 to $2 million?
How's that
gonna happen?
You know what?
It was ??
It was really
this decision that we made
to be great.
You know, our vision was
to become this iconic brand,
you know, this, like,
Gatorade of hygiene.
And so what we had to do was
primarily sell on e?commerce.
We knew we wanted
to expand into retail.
And do you have any deals
lined up?
Yes,
retail we have.
We actually got a letter
of intent from Pharmaca.
It's ??
It's this boutique pharmacy.
Uh,
the airlines.
You know,
we're in talk to be,
you know, on major airline,
uh, you know, also ??
That's smart.
The military.
The military.
Military is huge
for us.
Hey, Justin, I have one question
about the numbers.
I'm a little unclear.
You said 100% growth every year,
so from $300,000.
Yeah. Mm?hmm.
Year two you went to what,
year three you went to what?
Can you clarify that?
Yeah, yes.
In 2016, we did almost 100??
Uh, almost $300,000.
Herjavec: What will you do
this year?
Yeah, this year,
we're optimistic
that we'll hit that again,
but like I said,
we want to ??
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait, wait.
I'm sorry.
Have you
hit it already?
What are your sales year to date
right now?
$200,000.
And so how are you gonna get
to $600,000
by the end of December?
Yeah.
So, what we've done, like,
we focused on
our customer acquisition costs.
We were able to get
our customer acquisition costs
down to 25% of our run rate,
you know.
Yeah.
And as of August,
we had over 30% increase.
I'm gonna go with you
and say that the $600,000
is gonna happen.
I'm gonna be optimistic
with you.
Right.
Give me your earnings,
your net earnings.
What are you guys
bringing home?
'Cause that's how I'm
gonna evaluate what
the business is worth.
Forrester:
Like our gross margins?
Yeah,
we have 60% gross margins.
As of today?
Yes.
All right, okay, so let me
ask you a different one.
Are you profitable?
Yes, we are, but we're putting
everything back in.
Okay, so you're not
burning money right now.
You're not having to put
more money into the business
every month
to keep it alive.
Like I said,
we want to be great.
And so it was important that
we looked at what was working
and we double down
on it.
Herjavec: I?I'm still
a little confused.
If you sell $100,000
in a single month,
your gross margin
will be $60,000.
What would your net margin be
at the end of that?
Yeah, at that right there,
at $100,000?
Herjavec: Yeah.
We'd be left with that ??
that ?? that, uh, $40,000.
No,
the other way around.
$40,000?
It's the other way around.
Your gross margin ?? Your
gross margins are 60%.
Herjavec: No, no, you ??
you sell $100,000.
Let me ask the question
a different way.
Yes, please.
If the ?? If you do $600,000
this year...
Right.
Herjavec: ...after all
your other expenses,
what are you left with?
That's the net margin.
After ??
After all ??
If we ?? When we do
$600,000 this year,
after all of
our costs...
After all of our costs,
$600,000 ??
You know,
at all of our costs,
we'll be left with ??
You see, so the issue is that
we have ?? So we have ??
You have the 60% margin.
And ??
No, I get ??
But that's gross.
Yeah,
that's the gross margin.
So we take ??
We take the rest of the money
and we put it into
our marketing budget for growth.
Two new SKUs ??
No, you don't.
No, you don't.
We have two new SKUs ??
You take some of it
for marketing,
you take some of it
for payroll,
you take some of it
for rent.
Yeah, yeah, which ??
which ?? which ?? which ??
which fuels our growth.
Greiner: So, okay.
No, but what is
the number?
Guys, I'm gonna start
simplifying things here, right?
This ??
Business is a sport.
Yeah, definitely.
Right?
In order to be able
to be successful in football,
if you bust a coverage,
you're gonna get cut.
Cuban: In business, if you don't
understand your numbers
and understand
exactly what your next play is,
you're gonna get cut.
And for those reasons,
I'm out, guys.
Hunter: Thank you.
Thank you.
Hey, guys, look, I mean, NFL,
all the power to you.
You guys are
incredibly talented.
I learned
a very long time ago
that I have no talent,
and so ??
And we remind him of that
every day.
[ Laughter ]
So when I went out
in the world,
I just had to
execute better,
'cause execution
trumps talent all day long.
And so I got to believe
in your ability to execute.
Forrester: Mm?hmm.
And I ?? And I didn't
hear that today.
I'm not saying
you're not gonna get there,
but, uh,
not for me today. I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you, Robert.
Thank you.
We appreciate it.
Thank you.
Corcoran: Let me tell you
what I love about your product
and what I like
about you guys.
Now, first of all,
your enthusiasm is so genuine.
Nobody can sit here without
wanting to do business with you.
Thank you.
The thickness of this,
it's not like a baby wipe
or anything like it.
That was by design.
I don't even think I could
tear this or maybe even cut it.
It's just great.
Okay, all right.
That's what I love.
What I don't like at all
is your confusion.
The numbers
are so totally confused.
I think you probably had
eight or nine opportunities
to talk knowledgeably
about your numbers,
and yet I got more confused
as I listened harder,
and that's a concern
when you're an investor.
I'm out.
Rodriguez: Look, guys, you're
only as good as your team.
What I see for you guys,
I'd love to see you guys
bring in a real experienced guy,
a C. F. O., a controller,
someone who's locked down
with the numbers.
So when Sharks like us
come and challenge you
and ask you numbers
back and forth,
you don't get backed
into a corner.
You're saying, "Wait a minute.
Let me bring in my C. F. O."
Hmm.
So I wish you guys luck,
but for that reason, I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
So you have
one Shark left.
Come on.
Cuban:
Come on.
