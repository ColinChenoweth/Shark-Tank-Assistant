This is Dan Ziegler,
our friend and all?natural
professional body builder.
He's able
to maintain this physique
and still get his fix because
he eats Dough Bar doughnuts,
which are
protein?packed doughnuts.
[ Laughs ]
They're baked, not fried,
low in fat, sugar deprived,
plus each doughnut is packed
with 11 grams of protein,
including the hole.
Hmm.
We make eating
these healthy treats easy.
You go online,
you place your orders,
and they're shipped
directly to your door,
individually packaged.
Simply store them
in the fridge or freezer
and pop them in the microwave
when it's time to eat.
So, Sharks,
who wants a sample?
Herjavec: All right.
Greiner: Yeah,
we want a lot of them.
Less talk,
more eating!
[ Greiner laughs ]
Come on!
He's coming,
Barb.
[ Laughter ]
Sharks,
my name is Dan.
And my name is Nick.
We are
the founders of ChangEd,
and we're asking $250,000
for 15% of our company.
Shh.
Dude, do you hear that?
There's another shark
swimming in these waters,
a shark that,
no offense,
has more money
behind it
than all of you guys here today
combined.
Dun, dun, dun!
Meet student?loan debt.
She sits
at over $1.3 trillion.
But unlike you guys,
this shark is taking bites
out of Americans' dreams
and financial freedom.
Sharks,
we all know
college is an experience
you should never forget,
and you won't, especially if
you have to pay for it
for the next 10 to 25 years
after graduating.
It's gonna delay
any goals you may have,
and that is why ChangEd
is changing the way
Americans tackle
student?loan debt.
And, Sharks,
you remember change, right?
The change you used to toss
in a coin jar
or even
that treasure you found
under your couch cushions
at home.
Today,
we pay with plastic,
but what if I told you
that the digital change
from your
everyday purchases
can help pay off
American student debt?
Now we can,
using the ChangEd app.
Let us show you how it works.
It's pretty cool.
Dan,
take it away.
The ChangEd app
is super easy to use.
Simply create an account,
link your bank,
and ChandEd rounds up
your everyday purchases
to the next dollar.
Robert, let's say you buy
a cup of coffee for $3.45.
ChangEd rounds it up
to 4 bucks,
and you just saved 55 cents
towards your student loan.
All your round?ups
are stored
in a personal FDIC?insured
ChangEd account,
and once you accumulate
100 bucks,
we automate a payment
towards your student loan.
Each member
has their own dashboard
where they get to see
their daily round?ups,
check their
ChangEd balance,
and also see each payment
sent to their student loan.
The coolest part, though,
is they get to see
how much time and money
they save with each payment.
Your average
student?loan holder
can pay off their student loans
years sooner
and for thousands less
with the ChangEd app.
So, Sharks, who's ready to spare
a little bit more than change
to help Americans
pay down student debt?
What is your average daily users
and your average monthly users?
We launched
in March,
and we have
over 9,000 downloads
and just under 1,000 active
and open FDIC insured accounts,
and we recently ??
which is a really cool stat ??
we sent $20,000 in student?loan
payments since launching,
and we hope
by the end of this year
to reach $100,000
in student?loan payments.
Good for you.
We ??
Look,
I?I think student?loan debt
is one of the greatest problems
facing this country.
Right.
Right?
There's $1.3 trillion
and growing in student debt.
Yeah.
It impacts our economy,
it impacts people's ability
to go out and get a better job.
Both: Yeah.
It's crazy.
Now, look, this isn't
gonna solve it by a long shot.
Right.
But if you just make it
a little bit easier, right,
then that's a positive.
But from a business perspective,
how do you combat somebody
saying, "We'll just round up
some of your credit card.
We'll round up
some of your purchases.
We're gonna do overdrafts,
we're gonna do student loans,
we're gonna do ??
pay off your house,"
whatever it is,
right?
How do you deal with more ??
more feature?rich competitors?
We're the first platform
that is specifically targeting
student?loan debt.
We've learned
over the past few months
how difficult it is
to navigate to apply payments,
so we've
developed relationships
with 90% of the student?loan
services in this country
to make sure payments
are applied effectively,
efficiently,
and quickly.
The thing
with student loans,
people have
an emotional attachment to them
because it's ?? it's tens
of thousands of dollars
that you borrowed
when you were 18 years old.
Hey, guys, I love the mission,
first of all.
Thank you.
I appreciate it.
I think Mark is right.
It's one of the biggest issues
we have in this country.
Tell me a little bit about your
background and why this space.
Yeah, so obviously,
me and Dan are brothers.
He has
the better hair genetics.
[ Laughter ]
But I've got
a solid ??
I've got a solid beard,
and I always claim that.
We're from Chicago.
Hi, Lori.
[ Laughter ]
And we were raised
by a single mom
that told us that we had to
work our butts off
to get
what we wanted.
She immigrated from Poland,
and she worked three jobs
just to keep
clean clothes on our back
and food
on the table.
Going to college,
we had to borrow money,
which kind of
landed us here, right?
We have this problem now,
and we're ??
we're trying to address it
because we feel the pain.
Like,
Dan's living at home.
He's making
a?a student loan payment,
I think $800
student?loan payment a month.
I pay $800 in student?loan
payments every month.
Wow.
Greiner:
Is this your full?time job?
So, I'm ??
I'm in sales.
I've been in sales, uh,
for about eight years now.
What do you sell?
What do you sell?
I sell Mazdas.
And, Nick,
what do you do?
Right now,
I work full?time on ChangEd,
but what I do
to make money is
I wake up every morning
at 5:00,
drive Uber, and drive people
to work, go to my office.
And then when my day is done,
I go drive people back home,
uh, head home,
and then just, you know ??
You're a hustler.
That's the way you do it,
right?
That's the way
you hustle.
So, like ??
We're not ??
That's what
I'm talking about!
[ Both laugh ]
Thanks, Mark.
But besides that, you never
told us, how do you make money?
How do you monetize?
Yes.
Right now, we charge
$1 a month member fee.
People aren't
balking at it
because they can see
how much they're saving.
How many members
did you have last month?
We're ??
We're just under 1,000,
so I'd say open accounts
were right around 800.
So you made $800
last month.
Roughly.
Roughly $800,
yep.
Dan and Mitch,
I love your energy. Absolutely.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Corcoran:
I mean, who wouldn't want
to come to your party
and play?
[ Both laugh ]
That kind of thing,
right?
Uh, the part that I don't trust
totally, and I wish I could,
is I just can't picture
if I'm a bank
just sitting
on the sidelines
and not rounding up
people's change,
which you're already doing,
and applying it
to the student loan.
I think
it's just that extra step.
But on top of that, it gives
them on trade to refinancing.
For that reason,
I'm out.
All right, thank you so much,
Barbara.
Pleasure.
Thank you.
Hey, guys, I?I just want to say,
first of all, congrats.
I love the passion.
Thank you so much.
Two brothers,
single mother.
Totally relate with that.
A few things I don't like.
I don't like that you don't have
a real competitive advantage,
and I also don't like
that you don't have a defense
for your competitors.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
All right, Alex.
Thank you for your time.
All right, guys, why is this
a $1.6 million valuation?
As you guys well know, uh,
a company at a stage like us,
the valuation is more
of an art than a science,
but we've talked
to experts ??
[ Laughs ]
I'm just saying.
Greiner:
You're getting creative.
That's the best answer ever!
It really is.
Herjavec: Yeah.
It's very difficult
to ?? to value a company
at our stage, right?
But we're in a market that is
screaming for a solution,
and we feel that we have
the right solution.
Not only that,
we've talked to experts
in the valuation space
that valued our company
anywhere from $1.6 million
to $2.5 million.
And because we know the value
that you guys can bring ??
Herjavec: So, hang on.
Let me tell you something.
I like to paint.
I like to sing.
Mm?hmm.
I write some poetry.
Yeah.                     Okay.
I'm a bit
of a dancer, too.
So I like to think
I'm an artist.
Okay.
You said
valuations are art.
Here's my stab
at art.
Okay. [ Laughs ]
And honestly, there's lots of
things I don't like about it.
I just love you guys.
Yeah.
Thank you so much.
You guys are fantastic.
I think
you're gonna hustle.
But it's brand?new
and it's early.
I'll give you the $250,000,
but I want 48%.
[ Laughs ]
Wow.
Oh, my God.
Rodriguez:
Highway robbery.
We really ?? We really love
the stroke of your brush,
but we'd love to hear
the other offers.
Greiner:
Okay, I love what it does.
I think
it's very admirable.
It's a huge problem.
It's a crippling problem
for most people.
Right.
On the flip side,
I feel that your valuation
is a little, um, rich.
Oh!
Do you?
So I'm going to go out.
All right, Lori, thank you
so much for your time.
Thank you.
Okay, so, guys,
have you raised other money?
Uh, so we've
bootstrapped this
up until
a couple months ago.
We raised a small
friends and family run
of around $50,000.
Got it. How much have you all
put in yourself?
Uh, I've put in pretty much
my entire life savings
of about $30,000.
And my ?? my ??
my time savings.
I'm spending so much time
on ChangEd.
He ??
He's the sweat equity.
I?I ??
[ Laughs ]
Me and Dan are all about
smiling, dialing,
walking and talking,
and slaying
and paying down student loans.
Paying down student loans.
We're all about that.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
How do you get your next
10,000 downloads?
Our strategy now is to tap into
the alumni organizations
to reach the people that are
already feeling the pain,
working with universities
and, like, get on the ground
because what we're ??
That's my problem.
I don't see that scaling.
You haven't gone through
the whole
customer?acquisition program,
which, look,
I like being lean and mean,
but at some point,
you got to start sprinting.
Right, yeah.
You haven't
demonstrated anything
that says
you can sprint.
Convince me
that you guys can sprint.
One of the things
we want to do
with some of the funds we
raised is to develop an
Android app 'cause we're ??
Hey, Nick, if Mark's gonna
make you an offer,
let him
make an offer.
Otherwise, I'm gonna be like
Van Gogh and cut off my ear.
[ Laughter ]
Cuban: All right, guys,
I'll make you an offer.
250K for 25% of the company.
What do you say?
Okay.
Is there any room
to negot??
No.
Dan: Robert's offer
was a little rich.
Yeah.
But at the end of the day,
Mark's offer made sense to us
because not only was it close
to the valuation we wanted,
we also see value in Mark
as a partner.
