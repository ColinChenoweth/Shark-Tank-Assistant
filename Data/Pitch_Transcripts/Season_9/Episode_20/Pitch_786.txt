Hi, Sharks.
My name is Martin Dimitrov.
I'm an entrepreneur
from Chicago.
My company is called SnapClips.
I'm seeking $150,000 in exchange
for 15% equity in my company.
Dimitrov:
Yeah, absolutely.
And how old are you?
I just turned 19 this year.
Greiner: Wow.
In August.
Martin,
are you still in school?
Uh, I'm actually
going to college right now.
I'm a sophomore at University
of Illinois at Chicago.
Wow.
They really are strong.
Martin, so let's say
you get an investment.
Is your plan
take some of that money
Martin,
what do you sell them for?
The retail is $29.99.
And what are your sales,
Martin, for this year?
This year, we've done $6,500.
Keep in mind that we did
only launch a month ago.
6,500 units?
Uh, dollars.
Dollars.
[ Chuckles ]
Yeah.
That's it?
But last year,
we did $23,000 in a month.
It was actually about $25,000.
Some people
missed the Kickstarter.
Martin, how did you come up
with $1 million valuation?
So, we did about $25,000
in sales on Kickstarter.
A couple trickled in
after our Kickstarter ended.
So, you know, I'll say
that we did that for a year.
That's about $300,000.
Herjavec: Martin,
let me start.
I?I think
it's a great product.
I think you're incredible
at 19 years old.
But I think
this is a bit of a journey,
Corcoran: Martin,
you're the right entrepreneur,
no doubt.
Nobody here would doubt you
for a second.
It's just not a product
I relate to,
which is the reason I'll go out,
as well.
Thank you.
Listen, I'm ??
I'm gonna give you a flier.
Okay.
'Cause my thought is that
the patent's interesting.
But I'm thinking of a million
other things to do with it
than what you actually
came in here
thinking about
the weights.
Here's the way I would
structure the deal.
Okay.
I would do $150,000...
50%.
50%?
Narrator:
Two Sharks are out.
Martin is seeking $150,000 for
15% of his company, SnapClips.
Lori is interested,
but she wants
50% of the business.
Herjavec: 50%?
Greiner:
50/50 partners.
Okay, Martin, let me ??
let me try to simplify.
What would you counter?
Let me hear
what you would counter.
Forget the counter.
Okay, look,
it does take a lot of work,
but you deserve a ton of credit,
all right?
I think her offer of 50%
is ridiculous.
I would never tell anybody
to take that.
Now, 15% isn't enough,
