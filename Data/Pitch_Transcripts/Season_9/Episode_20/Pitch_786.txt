Hi, Sharks.
My name is Martin Dimitrov.
I'm an entrepreneur
from Chicago.
My company is called SnapClips.
I'm seeking $150,000 in exchange
for 15% equity in my company.
Dimitrov:
Yeah, absolutely.
And how old are you?
I just turned 19 this year.
Greiner: Wow.
In August.
Wow.
And you
thought this up when?
Uh, when I was a junior
in high school.
Wow.
Cuban:
Good for you.
Herjavec:
Put your hand out.
No. [ Laughs ]
They're actually ??
They're pretty strong.
Martin,
are you still in school?
Uh, I'm actually
going to college right now.
I'm a sophomore at University
of Illinois at Chicago.
Wow.
They really are strong.
Martin, so let's say
you get an investment.
Is your plan
take some of that money
and hire somebody
full?time?
Are you gonna drop out of school
for a couple of years?
Yeah, I?I mean, school's always
gonna be there to take my money.
[ Laughs ]
I'm ready to go
both legs into this.
So you'll quit school and go
into this business right away?
Yeah.
Martin,
what do you sell them for?
The retail is $29.99.
For one?
And what do you
make them for?
$8.50.
For the pair.
And what are your sales,
Martin, for this year?
This year, we've done $6,500.
Keep in mind that we did
only launch a month ago.
6,500 units?
Uh, dollars.
Dollars.
[ Chuckles ]
Yeah.
That's it?
But last year,
we did $23,000 in a month.
It was actually about $25,000.
Some people
missed the Kickstarter.
Martin, how did you come up
with $1 million valuation?
So, we did about $25,000
in sales on Kickstarter.
A couple trickled in
after our Kickstarter ended.
So, you know, I'll say
that we did that for a year.
That's about $300,000.
And you multiply that by 2,
which I've seen some valuations
being done like that.
So that's about $500,000
right there, a little bit over.
And then I value the patent.
I?I actually value it
at over $1 million,
but humbly, I would say
it's valued at $500,000.
Have you gone
to any other industry?
Yeah, so,
I actually know one of a ??
a couple industry leaders
in the wire?management area,
and they were really interested
in the patent
because of how it could be used,
you know,
just for storing wires
like this.
So, you know, you just ??
This is just a SnapClip,
but, you know,
we'd make something
a lot more cost?effective,
and you could just hang it
like this.
And it saves a lot of money,
and it's so much easier
because it's reusable.
I mean, honestly,
that's what I see
is everything
with this.
I mean,
I don't know that much
about the weights in the gym
and all of that,
but it seems to me
the application of this
is fabulous for any type
of hose ?? garden hose...
Yeah.
...wires, utility,
whatever it is.
That's everything.
It's just
marketing this,
like,
getting it out there.
That's ??
That's why I came here.
That's the hard part.
Herjavec: Martin,
let me start.
I?I think
it's a great product.
I think you're incredible
at 19 years old.
But I think
this is a bit of a journey,
and you got to get into
the other markets
for it to be interesting
to me.
It's not for me.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Corcoran: Martin,
you're the right entrepreneur,
no doubt.
Nobody here would doubt you
for a second.
It's just not a product
I relate to,
which is the reason I'll go out,
as well.
Thank you.
Listen, I'm ??
I'm gonna give you a flier.
Okay.
'Cause my thought is that
the patent's interesting.
But I'm thinking of a million
other things to do with it
than what you actually
came in here
thinking about
the weights.
Here's the way I would
structure the deal.
Okay.
I would do $150,000...
50%.
50%?
Narrator:
Two Sharks are out.
Martin is seeking $150,000 for
15% of his company, SnapClips.
Lori is interested,
but she wants
50% of the business.
Herjavec: 50%?
Greiner:
50/50 partners.
And I'm gonna
tell you why.
You're 19.
You're in school.
You have a lot
ahead of you.
You have a lot
to do.
Uh?huh.
This is a clever idea,
and you have a patent.
But somebody
has to come in
and take this
from ground zero...
Turn it
into a company.
...and turn it
into something big.
And that's a lot, a lot,
a lot, a lot of work.
Now, I've done it
with our Simply Fit Board,
with other products.
We've done hundreds
of millions in sales.
But you don't get that
without really putting in
an incredible amount
of work,
which is why
I'm offering,
if another Shark
wants to come in with me.
I'll take that deal.
Okay, Martin, let me ??
let me try to simplify.
What would you counter?
Let me hear
what you would counter.
Forget the counter.
Okay, look,
it does take a lot of work,
but you deserve a ton of credit,
all right?
I think her offer of 50%
is ridiculous.
I would never tell anybody
to take that.
Now, 15% isn't enough,
but I do think Alex and Lori
could add some value.
So here's my offer.
I'll convince these guys
to come in,
but it's 150K for 30%.
Let me explain to you
what I'm thinking here.
I get
in the trenches,
and I grind
with my entrepreneurs.
Mm?hmm.
If I now have
these two amazing partners,
then I'm sharing...
The work.
...some of the hard work
with you.
That I'll accept.
I would then
go down to 30%.
Alex, look, I'll bring the
Mavs in. We'll put a Mavs logo.
We'll put it in there.
We'll get other teams
in the NBA.
It'll go from there.
Alex,
you bring your gyms in.
I am in
if he stays in school.
I agree. I'm not doing this deal
unless you stay in.
