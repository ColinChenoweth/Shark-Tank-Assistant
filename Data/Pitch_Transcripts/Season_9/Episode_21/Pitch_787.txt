Hi, Sharks.
My name is Chas Smith.
And my name
is Nikita Salmon.
And we're cousins
from Vermont
and co?founders of SAP!
We're here today
asking for $600,000
in exchange
for 12% of our business.
Growing up
in the woods of Vermont,
it's impossible to ignore the
beautiful maple and birch trees.
And sap...
is the lifeblood
of these trees.
Their roots pull nutrient?rich
groundwater from the soil,
which combines with
the sugar stored in the trees
to form this complex
substance, known as sap,
which helps these trees
to grow.
Sap naturally contains
antioxidants, electrolytes,
and over
40 other nutrients,
like B vitamins, iron,
and manganese.
These trees greatly benefit
from their sap,
so why can't we?
That's why we created SAP!,
a healthy beverage company
sourced straight from nature.
And this sap is sourced
from our family farm
and our network
of Vermont producers.
We want to keep
to our roots
and grow the next great
beverage brand
that can help people live
a long and healthy life.
So, Sharks, who wants to get in
on this untapped business?
?Let's try some SAP!
?Let's do it.
Let's not be a sap, right?
Don't be a sap.
Try a SAP!
SAP!
?So, you just grab...
?The whole thing's for me?
?Uh, the three.
?All three?
Any particular order
I'm drinking this in?
?You know what, Bob? Yeah.
?Yeah, we do the seltzer,
?then the soda, then the birch.
?Okay. Thank you.
So, we recommend trying
the green one first.
What's this one?
So, the first product
is our maple sap seltzer.
So, this is pure maple sap
sourced right
from the maple trees.
?That tastes really good.
?Thanks.
It's almost sort of
like cotton candy.
It's smooth.
I mean, it's not a lot
of calories, either,
for what you get.
?Yeah, so, this ??
?How many calories?
?40.
This first product
is supposed to really be
more of a sparkling?water?type
experience.
Then the maple sap soda...
This one?
So, Chas, what's your cost?
Blended across
the three products,
about 50 cents right now.
?50 cents? That's expensive.
?Okay.
And what are
your total sales?
Total sales to date
are about $400,000.
We're seeing an explosion,
especially around
sparkling water right now.
But in that category,
there's really not a lot
of health attributes
to a normal seltzer
or a normal sparkling water.
It's really
just demineralized water
with some natural flavor
added to it.
Can you explain why this would
be healthy for someone to drink,
versus
just a plain sparkling water?
So, maple naturally
has 46 vitamins,
minerals, and nutrients.
Birch actually has
a little bit more than that.
These are some of the most
nutrient?rich waters on earth.
How did you get the idea
to make soda
when you're making
maple syrup?
And does
Nikita actually speak?
Yes.
[ Laughter ]
You know, growing up,
you know,
I was in?? involved
in the industry.
My parents' main source
of income is maple syrup.
When I was 19,
I got into the business,
and I purchased the farm
from them when I was 20, so...
Wow.
I have 12,000 taps,
which is kind of a ??
a mid?size operation in Vermont.
Wow.
About 300 acres.
I had, you know,
5,000?gallon tanks
of maple sap sitting there,
and we were, you know, fooling
around with the carbonation,
mixing it with bourbon, maybe,
here and there.
And that's where the best
ideas came from, right?
That's where ?? Absolutely.
Where does the water
come from?
Are you literally
tapping the tree?
We tap a very small hole,
following, you know, organic
standard tapping methods
so that we don't damage
the trees.
So, you can see here
some taps going into the trees.
So, in the spring,
the trees naturally flow sap
to ?? to leaf out, and then
we're taking that raw product
and then carbonating
and canning,
so you're getting
the raw product ??
So, you're adding
the carbonation and the water?
There's actually no water
in these products.
This is the liquid
that comes out of the trees.
?That's pretty cool.
?Seriously?
?Yeah.
?You're adding no water?
?Right here?
?No water. No.
You should say that
on the can.
?Yep.
?So, look.
I?I?I understand beverages
a little bit.
If you guys are coming out
at $1.99, which is doable,
many brands do that,
what is that one or two things
that you have that go,
"Guys, we do this well"?
So, the maple products
have prebiotics in them,
so they're good
for your gut health,
properties that help reduce
inflammation in the body
so that ??
I'm still struggling as
to the why I'm making the
leap...
Mm?hmm.
...from a regular soda
at 79 cents or 99 cents...
Yep.
...to double that
on SAP! Made in Trees.
This is
a multi?use beverage,
so it's ?? it's a product
that the entire family can use,
and it's the next level above
the traditional seltzer
in a nutrition sense.
Give it to us in one line.
?Yeah.
?One line.
Basically, I would say this ??
It protects your body.
How does it help
with inflammation?
Because that's the big
buzzword now, right?
Yep.
Everybody's saying
inflammation causes cancer.
So, how does this stop
inflammation in the body?
Or help lessen it?
It's this complex substance
that has,
you know,
not just 46 nutrients,
but also a lot of kind
of bioactive properties.
And so, you know,
we've actually been working
with University of Vermont,
University of Cornell
a little bit
to study these properties
a little bit more.
We're helping to try
to bring new research
out there right now.
Do you not really
have that yet?
Are you doing testing
that says maybe we'll be able
to prove this?
Some ??
Yeah, there's some research
out there, absolutely.
I think our top customer
is probably a mom
buying for her family
who has a slightly
higher willingness to pay.
She's wanting to buy it
for her kids
because it's a much better
option than a traditional soda.
Her husband's
probably not gonna use it.
Your story's too long, Chas.
No, I totally get that.
Yeah, I get it, too.
Yeah.
?It's just that sugar can ??
?But it's too long.
The product, other than
the one, aren't bad, right?
And I could see giving it my
kids as an alternative to soda
when they have a sweet tooth
and ?? and feel good about it.
So I see what you're
trying to accomplish,
but your marketing sucks.
You've got to simplify this
in a way that's just obvious.
I don't see
that you're there yet.
I'm out.
Ah, fair enough.
All the claims you made,
and probably spent 1/3
of your time here today
explaining why it's good
for your health,
et cetera, et cetera ??
None of it's really conveyed
by the name, the tag line,
or anything.
But then, after that,
I don't like the way it tastes.
For those reasons, I'm out.
So, I liked all three,
and the funniest thing to me
of it all is,
I don't like maple syrup.
I really love
the health thing,
but you're early
for that testing.
My heart wanted to be in
so bad.
I'm sorry.
I'm out.
That's all right.
Thank you.
I don't have an issue
with any of it.
I loved when you came out,
"SAP! Protect your body."
You're the real deal,
but you need somebody
to drive that message.
So I'm gonna make you
an offer.
?Oh!
?Whoo!
I'll offer you the $600,000
for 30%.
Cuban: Ooh.
Ooh.
?Ooh.
Oza: Ooh.
You see how they are
just running to say yes?
They haven't said no, Mark.
Yeah, absolutely.
Rohan?
Look, guys,
it's very tough to start
and get
a beverage business going.
So I want to give you
some credit on that.
My struggle is, you can't
get me a why quickly enough
so that when I have
the 5 seconds on the shelf,
I'm gonna reach in
and grab it.
And I feel
that the functional benefit
to justify a $2.00 price point
to me doesn't exist.
And so, for that reason,
unfortunately, I'm out.
Fair enough.
Wow.
I should change my offer.
You just talked me out of it,
Rohan.
Yeah, and I just want
to kind of follow up
on a couple of those points.
?No!
?No, he's out. Don't bother.
?No.
?Okay.
?It's over. It's done.
?All right.
You might say something
Robert doesn't want to hear.
You have an offer from a ??
from a great Shark.
So, guys, you can counter.
What do you want to do?
