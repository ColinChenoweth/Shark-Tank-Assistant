Hi, Sharks.
I'm Brent.
after you do the deal.
?Brent, is it ??
Is it selling time,
or is it closing time?
Right?
?Let me say something, Brent.
?Sure.
There's a piece of me
that is saying
you'd be really annoying
to work with.
However, Brent's personality
may jeopardize the deal.
There's a piece of me
that is saying
you'd be really annoying
to work with.
So don't prove me right
on that instinct.
Guys, I'm gonna make it easy
for Barbara.
I think
the product's too heavy.
I don't think
it's original enough.
I think
it's a little bit too expensive.
I just am not
all that excited about it.
And so for those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay.
Thanks, Mark.
I'm gonna make it easier, too.
I like the concept.
Mark and I did InstaFire
and it ??
It's a great product.
?Which is a great product.
InstaFire burns indefinitely,
and it's safe,
all?natural, and nontoxic.
This burns
for only six hours.
So I'm sorry.
I'm out.
Thanks, Lori.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Rohan,
what are you gonna do?
Well, they haven't given
Barbara a response yet,
so, I mean, you know...
Well, I think they're waiting
to see what you're gonna do.
Really? Are you guys ??
Are you out or not?
I'm waiting to see
what you're gonna do.
I'd like them
to respond to Barbara.
I mean, I feel like
she ?? You know, they
got to respect that.
?Barbara, I think that ??
?No, no.
He has an ulterior motive.
I'm surprised
Barbara's still in.
He wants you to respond
to me...
He's not being nice.
...so he can give you
a worse deal.
You know, Barbara,
I want to work with you.
And ?? And ?? And ??
And I don't take it personally
that you think I'm annoying,
because, honestly,
I'm not annoying.
?You've heard it before?
I just ?? I do what I do,
and I get things done.
So I?I don't
find that annoying.
I just fi?? I find it honest.
Like,
I'll tell you what I feel,
and I hope you tell me,
you know, how you feel.
I find you a little annoying.
That's fine.
That's fine. That's fine.
But, at the end of the day,
if we're working together...
Yeah.
...and you need me
to go out and pitch somebody,
you're gonna want me
to know all the information
before I make a deal.
Brent, honestly,
I have total confidence in you
as an entrepreneur.
You have that fire in your belly
that I'm always looking for.
All my great entrepreneurs
are annoying in one way.
When I used to manage
salespeople,
I always knew who were
gonna be the best ones
because they drove me nuts,
okay?
I don't object to that.
Oza: I actually like
your engaging personality.
I like the fact
that you've got ??
You've intimidated
the crap out of Robert.
He hasn't said anything,
sitting in the corner there.
Robert, you're a Boy Scout.
You've been a Boy Scout.
I was a Queen Scout.
I actually like ??
I like what you have to offer.
There you go.
That didn't come out right.
?A Queen Scout?
?That didn't come out right.
?Wait just...
?What's a Queen Scout?
?Do you want to define that?
?Really?
In Canada,
the top scout you could be...
Got to be for queen.
Anybody...
...would be a Queen Scout,
so it was like an Eagle Scout.
I just wanted to define that.
Anyway, go ahead, Rohan.
Anyway, so...
?Oh, boy.
?...I?I think
I have a larger network...
Okay.
...than Barbara has.
I feel that the products
that I have
go with a lot
of those areas.
So I'll also offer you
$50,000 for 25%.
And if I could just
add something else...
I have no doubt in my mind
that this is a winner.
The portability of this,
the size of it,
the weight of it,
you could stack it,
it's easy to show in an aisle,
you don't need an end cap.
This is a phenomenal product.
?Thank you, Barbara.
It's a moneymaker, honey.
I don't see it just in
camping goods or sporting goods.
I see it in gift shops.
I mean, you've done
an amazing job with this.
[ Cuban laughs ]
?Oh, boy. Here we go.
?Mark ?? Mark laughs.
But I have this
in several clothing boutiques
that have been selling it
and reordering.
?Yeah, of course.
?Absolutely.
People pay for convenience.
People pay for cool.
I don't find you annoying.
So, Robert,
is there an offer there?
I find you ??
Robert, make your offer.
I find you quirky.
I'll also offer you $50,000
for 25%.
