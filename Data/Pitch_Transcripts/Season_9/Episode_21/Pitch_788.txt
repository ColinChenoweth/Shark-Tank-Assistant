Hi, Sharks.
I'm Brent.
after you do the deal.
?Brent, is it ??
Is it selling time,
or is it closing time?
Right?
?Let me say something, Brent.
?Sure.
There's a piece of me
that is saying
you'd be really annoying
to work with.
However, Brent's personality
may jeopardize the deal.
There's a piece of me
that is saying
you'd be really annoying
to work with.
So don't prove me right
on that instinct.
Guys, I'm gonna make it easy
for Barbara.
I think
the product's too heavy.
I don't think
it's original enough.
I think
it's a little bit too expensive.
I just am not
all that excited about it.
before I make a deal.
Brent, honestly,
I have total confidence in you
as an entrepreneur.
You have that fire in your belly
that I'm always looking for.
All my great entrepreneurs
are annoying in one way.
When I used to manage
salespeople,
I always knew who were
gonna be the best ones
because they drove me nuts,
okay?
I don't object to that.
Oza: I actually like
your engaging personality.
I like the fact
that you've got ??
You've intimidated
the crap out of Robert.
He hasn't said anything,
sitting in the corner there.
Robert, you're a Boy Scout.
You've been a Boy Scout.
I was a Queen Scout.
I actually like ??
I like what you have to offer.
There you go.
That didn't come out right.
?A Queen Scout?
?That didn't come out right.
?Wait just...
?What's a Queen Scout?
?Do you want to define that?
?Really?
In Canada,
the top scout you could be...
Got to be for queen.
Anybody...
...would be a Queen Scout,
so it was like an Eagle Scout.
I just wanted to define that.
Anyway, go ahead, Rohan.
Anyway, so...
?Oh, boy.
?...I?I think
I have a larger network...
Okay.
...than Barbara has.
I feel that the products
that I have
go with a lot
of those areas.
So I'll also offer you
$50,000 for 25%.
