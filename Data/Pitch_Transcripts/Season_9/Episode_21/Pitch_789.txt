We want her to know
what she's getting into, Mark.
Bryan: We ??
?Come on.
?Well, that's what you do
I'm Julie from
Cornelius, North Carolina.
Julie.
Cuban: It's okay.
It's only the most important
day in your life.
Corcoran:
You got our name right.
Julie: I mean, it is
a dog product, right?
Well, dogs like bones.
It is a dog product.
So, Julie, I got to ask...
Yes.
...why?
I love dogs.
Sure.
Sure.
I know you do.
What's wrong with water?
Well, you know,
I want our dogs to enjoy
the variety of beverages
that we do, as well.
So, I found a veterinary
nutritionist to formulate it.
We worked on several different
flavor profiles, Lori,
I brought Ryan
on board.
Ryan,
did you put money in it?
I'm a principal
in the business.
How much?
Yeah, I?I put in $25,000.
So what are your sales
for the last 18 months?
Go ahead.
Corcoran: Your sales.
Sales for the last 16 months
were $16,000.
Wow.
That's not great news.
Julie: We don't ?? We're ??
We're out of product.
So, we literally
don't have product,
which is why
we're here today.
We're at a crossroads here.
Why haven't you sold
anything else, unless...
We're out of product.
Wait. Okay, guys,
none of this is adding up.
Okay, here's the timeline
as I see it...
Oza: Let's back it up.
Then where did
the other $90,000 go?
What happened to the other
$90,000, Julie?
Th?The other $90,000 went
to the research,
the product run
cost a lot of money.
You had product,
so why didn't you sell that?
Sure.
We ?? We sold the product.
