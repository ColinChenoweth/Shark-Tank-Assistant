Yeah. So, same single
ingredient ?? maple sap ??
but what we do is, we remove
more water from the sap
to sweeten it up to create more
of a soda?like experience.
I like this one.
That one mixes fantastic
with bourbon, as well.
Wow! That's like, um,
drinking Aunt Jemima's.
So, the third product
is birch sap.
You know what's interesting?
That's sweet, yeah.
They're all different.
Ohh!
But they're really good.
?Very different.
?Robert, was that a good
or a bad "Ohh"?
?You don't like that?
?Bad. That's a bad.
?But Robert doesn't like sweet.
?It's an acquired taste, but...
?No, no, no. Try the yellow one.
?The last one. The yellow one...
?I am. I'm ?? I like the yellow.
?Oh.
?Yes.
?So, this is still for humans?
?Yeah.
That tastes like medicine,
for God's sake.
?Yeah.
?Yeah, it's more of a ??
?It's more of a ??
?Ohh!
?Wow.
?You don't like it, either?
?[ Laughs ]
?Oh, my God.
To be fair,
the first two are great.
?Ohh!
?The sec??
The third's a tad nasty.
?Take it behind a barn
and shoot it.
?I don't think ??
I don't think
the third one's bad.
I wouldn't serve this
to Barbara.
So, let me tell you about
the birch a little bit.
It hasn't really come to the
United States yet, because...
Obviously.
Yeah, because it doesn't
make a great syrup
like maple, but it has
a lot more nutrients
and health benefits, so it's
very good for your overall ??
I could see this
curing a hangover.
Like, a really bad hangover.
Yeah, it's a great ??
It's a great hangover cure.
And what's the price today?
What are your sales?
We've only been in business
about 15 months
with these products, and the
birch is even newer than that.
$1.99 per can and
about $7.99 for a four?pack.
?"Smokin'." Can we see it?
?Can we get samples?
?Absolutely.
?Great puns.
We'll hand out
some samples to you.
Herjavec: Yeah.
?Great puns.
?Perfect.
Greiner: Is there
a difference between the tins,
like scents or anything?
?Scents.
?There. Absolutely.
?Absolutely there is.
I like that.
Give me a good scent.
You're all getting
the original.
?Thank you so much.
?Wow.
?You're welcome.
?Do you have a lighter, too?
?Whoa, that's heavy.
?Yeah. You want to light it up?
?Oh, it's wax.
?Just on the side?
Directly on the briquettes.
Oh, you just got
to hold it for a little bit.
?There you go.
?Yeah.
Oh, cool!
?Hit a couple of them.
?This is ?? Oh, there we go.
Oh, wow!
It's really cool.
What do you make it for?
$5.75.
$5.75.
Wholesale's $12.50.
It retails $25.00.
And how do you sell it?
How many hours does this burn?
So, this will burn
for up to six hours.
Just six?
How much does ??
How much does this weigh?
?Just six. It's a 4?pound unit.
?4 pounds, Mark.
?4 pounds?
?Yeah.
?Does this create ship??
?So, then...
...shipping problems,
the fact that it's so heavy?
Sure.
So, it costs about $9.50
to ship it in the U. S.
for one,
but it only costs
about $13.00 to ship two.
I want to go back
to the burn time...
?Yeah.
?Sure.
...because it's $25.00,
but you only get
six hours' burn time.
?Only?
?Six hours is a long time.
?So, okay...
?Yeah. That's...
That's not that long.
Our InstaFire
burns indefinitely.
?Lori.
?That's not that long.
So, how does this compare
to InstaFire,
a deal
that Lori and I did?
InstaFire is meant to,
you know,
make a traditional type
of campfire,
either in a fireplace
or a...
But I could just buy ?? I?I
could just bring a tin with ??
from my cookies, right?
InstaFire is a ??
an awesome product.
There's no question
about that.
This is built for families,
okay?
If you want to have a campfire
in your backyard,
you take this out,
and you throw it up.
Why couldn't I just take a tin
and put a couple InstaFires in
to save ?? save some money
and accomplish the same thing?
It's convenient.
Convenience is
a bigger factor.
Real outdoors people
use InstaFire, okay?
This is a product
for a lot of people
that don't necessarily want to
be outdoors for days at a time.
Break down the numbers
for me.
We've been shipping
for 30 days, Rohan.
We sold 1,100 units.
Oh, wow.
We crowdfunded 400 units.
Okay, how much?
What was your goal?
$1,000. We were trying
to get a proof of concept.
We've done 6?? 6??
Greiner: So, you've only been
in business,
essentially, for 30 days?
That's correct.
And it was
a crowdfunding campaign?
No, no.
Just wait a sec.
Once we got
the concept proved
and people
were interested in it,
we've sold 600 through
traditional wholesale retail.
Where?
What kind of retail?
Surf shops, camp stores...
Tell 'em the Kauai story.
...sporting?goods stores.
Tell 'em the Kauai story.
My wife and I
were on vacation.
Even before we were shipping,
I had samples of it,
We went to Kauai,
and we were using it,
taking pictures of it,
and people were coming up
and saying, "Oh, my God,
where'd you get that?
Where'd you get that?"
But ?? But I wanted
to ask you that.
Okay, wait. Before you ??
Guys. Hey, guys.
We're starting
to get a lot of smoke.
Can you put a lid on it?
Yeah. Pardon?
In areas
where I can't have a fire,
like a beach or a forest...
Sure.
...am I allowed
to light this?
Yeah,
in ?? in most instances,
what you need
is a contained fire, okay?
This is a contained fire,
and so, yeah,
you're allowed to do it.
You can shut it on and off, just
like I?I?I demonstrated here.
So you can have a campfire
and literally get up and leave,
and no one knows
you were there.
What are the other scents?
Is that
a mosquito?repelling one?
That's correct.
It has eucalyptus
and lemon oil in it
to repel mosquitoes.
And the last one
is a s'more kit.
And then we have
a ?? a s'more kit.
What about ?? A concern I have
is the heat of the tin.
I don't see any warning
on the tin.
As soon as you open up
the tin,
there's a warning label
and instruction manual inside.
Okay. So, I'm gonna make you
an offer, all right?
I'll give you $50,000
for 25%.
Thank you so much
for the offer.
But this ??
Well, you're not gonna
just say thank you...
Oh, okay.
...because I'd really like
to have an answer.
Okay. Great.
Do you want to tell them
the ?? the other sales point?
Yeah, let me ?? There's ??
Is this coming to a yes
or a no ?? the sales point?
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
Okay.
But there is ??
We just need to educate you
one more th??
about one more feature.
?There is one more feature.
She just made you an offer.
What else
do you need to educate her on?
we had to do
a lot of product sampling.
Then we ?? we were done.
Like, I didn't have
any more money.
Guys, look, you're coming across
as so scattered.
Hi.
I'm Sam Polk.
And I'm David Foster.
We're from
Los Angeles, California.
And we are the founders
of Everytable.
We are thrilled
to be here tonight,
and we're seeking investment
of $1 million
in exchange for 5%
of our company.
Whoo!
[ Chuckles ]
Everytable is a healthy,
grab?and?go concept
that's revolutionizing
the restaurant industry
and making healthy food
affordable for everyone.
Demand for healthy food
is exploding,
but the truth is,
when salads cost $15
and green juices cost $9,
healthy food has become
a luxury that few can afford.
Even worse,
there are some neighborhoods
called food deserts
that have absolutely no access
to healthy food at all.
At Everytable, we believe
that healthy food
is a human right.
And here is how we are
making that a reality.
Every morning
at our central kitchen,
our world?class chefs
prepare incredibly fresh,
healthy, and, importantly,
delicious meals.
Things like
a kale chicken Caesar salad,
vegan miso grain bowls,
and an out?of?this?world
Jamaican jerk chicken
with coconut, beans and rice,
and plantains,
which are then packaged
and sent to our restaurants.
Centralized production
results
in incredible efficiencies
in the kitchen
and makes our locations
significantly cheaper
to build and operate.
We opened stores
in affluent communities
and food?desert
communities.
And to make sure that our food
is affordable for everyone,
we vary the prices based on what
that neighborhood can afford.
We're on a mission
to make good food
available for everyone.
So, help us put
an Everytable
in every community
all across America.
You want to try some food?
Greiner: Yes.
?Sure.
?Why not?
?Yeah.
?Yeah, let's do it.
May I try
that jerk chicken, please?
?That's yours, actually.
?Yes.
Is it jerk chicken and miso?
Foster: Barbara, you've got
the Jamaican jerk chicken
for you.
Ladies first.
This is for you,
a kale chicken Caesar salad.
For you,
Puebla chicken tinga.
And, Robert...
Thank you.
...ensalada fresca
with chicken for you.
Thank you.
So, you've got
the dressing in there,
cheese if you'd like it.
?Great.
?Food tastes fantastic.
Greiner: Yeah.
Oza: By the way, I'm very much
bought in to your guys'
philosophy.
If you are lower income,
your access to better foods
gets reduced,
and you're stuck
with the bad products
because they're cheap.
So, I love the way
you're varying the pricing on,
you know,
if you can afford more,
you pay more, and if you can't,
you pay less.
Wait, explain that again,
'cause I missed that part.
Yeah, so we have locations
in affluent areas,
like Century City, Santa Monica,
and downtown,
and in those locations,
the stores sell these meals
for $7 or $8.
But we also opened stores
in places like South L. A.,
Baldwin Hills,
and coming soon,
Watts and Compton.
Mmm.
And in those communities,
we sell the same meals,
from the same stores, for exac??
for basically $4 to $5.
And each location is meant
to be profitable,
but just differently
profitable.
So you mentioned food deserts.
What exactly is that?
So, we ??
let me show you up here.
So this is a map
of Los Angeles.
These are all the sort of
affluent communities.
So you have Santa Monica
and Beverly Hills and Pasadena,
and in those locations,
per capita income
can be sometimes
$100,000, $150,000.
In this location,
this is neighborhoods like
South Los Angeles,
Watts, Compton.
You can have per capita income
as low as $13,000 a year.
Wow.
Now, these communities,
they're left out
of a functioning,
healthy food system.
So, for example, folks born
in this zip code right here
will live on average
12 years less
than folks born in this,
even though
they're 5 miles apart.
Why is there no healthy food
being pumped into those deserts?
If you think
about a fast?food chain,
they have potatoes,
which last forever,
they have frozen beef,
they have buns
that never go bad,
and they're all
very cheap.
Hmm.
So, you can run a business
that sells those foods at $5.
Makes sense.
If you're running
a healthy?food business,
you have fresh food,
there's more spoilage,
issues like that,
so it's hard to get
to a price point
that is comparable
to fast food...
I see.
...unless you structure it
from the beginning,
like we have,
to hit that price point.
Oza:
You're coming for $1 million,
which is a big amount.
You're then asking ??
You're only giving up 5%,
which, if my math is correct,
has put you
at a $20 million valuation.
Is that correct?
That's correct.
That's correct.
It's a healthy valuation.
Help me understand
why you think
your company's already worth
$20 million.
Let me just tell you
a little bit about our
fundraising history.
?Sure.
?So, we raised a seed round
of $2.9 million
on a convertible note.
?Of what valuation?
?A valuation cap at $7 million.
Subsequent to that,
raised $2 million
at a $23.5 million
valuation cap.
In terms of revenue, last year
we opened our first location,
so that's in South L. A.
That one did
about $650,000.
Oh, that's great.
And the way ?? We had
one location last summer.
We now have five.
So all rolled up,
the five locations,
the current run rate
is about $2.6 million.
So, are you burning money
right now?
Yeah, we are.
Our burn rate right now
is about $125,000 a month.
And that's basically
because
we've invested heavily
for growth.
So, what's your typical cost,
um, for a bowl, all in,
overhead?
$2.50 to 3 bucks, all in.
So, even when you're selling
for $5 in the food desert,
you're at a 40% to 50%
gross margin,
60% to 70% when
you're selling
for 8 bucks
in the affluent markets.
Can you share with me
your backgrounds?
I grew up in Los Angeles
and was always
super ambitious.
Went to Columbia and then
went to Wall Street.
And by the time I was 30,
I was a senior trader
at one of the largest
hedge funds in the world.
During the crash
of '08 and '09,
I started to shift
my vision of success.
And so, I left that world
and started a non?profit
called Groceryships
that helps parents
that are living in food deserts
get themselves
and their families healthy.
And that's ?? David and I met
through the non?profit.
I love what you did here today.
It's rare that we see someone
present so cleanly,
have all the answers,
keep their cool,
answer every question.
But the whole time,
I'm trying so hard to like it,
and I'm thinking, "What the hell
is bugging me here?"
Somehow, I don't think
you're entrepreneurs.
I don't feel
a fire in your belly.
You can call my wife
and ask her.
No, no, no.
Here's what I want to say.
You're not bringing it
on the table here today.
I'm just gonna trust
my instinct on this.
I wish you luck,
and I admire your mission,
but I'm out.
What you've achieved in one
year, I think it's fantastic.
But, here?? here's
my only challenge.
You know, in business, I like
to follow the poo?poo principle,
which is poo poo happens,
and the amount of money
that you've raised
and the valuation you have
of $20 million,
there is no room for poo poo.
You basically have built in
flawless execution
from now into the future.
I just know from reality,
poo poo happens.
I'm out.
I love the mission.
It's in sync with everything
that I'm about.
Here's my problem.
It's easy to raise money,
especially from where
you come from.
But what I wanted
to hear today was...
creativity, drive,
fire, and marketing.
But you were missing
that really important component.
So, unfortunately, I'm out.
On one hand,
I was really excited,
because the mission's awesome.
But the crusade part
scares the hell out of me.
$20 million valuation
means you need to generate
$20 million in profits
before I get my money back.
Right?
You're going
to have to go through a lot
of painful lessons first, right?
And I think the valuation,
to Robert's point,
isn't there to go through
the difficult times.
And so, for those reasons,
I'm out.
Oza:
I do like your idea.
My issue is your valuation
should be more in line
with what the market is.
I'll give you the upper end,
which is three times
your run rate, as you call it.
That would put you
at $7.5 million valuation.
We appreciate the offer.
At that level, that?that's not
super attractive,
and we'd like to find a way to
work with you, but on terms...
Wow.
...that are closer
to our original offer.
The forecast for next year is ??
is $6 million
with just company?owned stores,
so 3 times 6 is 18.
If you want to invest...
You're asking me to do
a multiple off next year.
Who knows what happens
next year?
I can only look
at what's there today.
It seems to me like
you're gonna have to really
come head to head here
right now.
Because, I mean, y?you ??
coming off of 18 to 20
is not really ?? it's not worth
a counter, to be honest.
You see where I'm at.
I'm fine if you want to counter
something above what I'm at,
but it's nowhere in the realm
of where you guys are at.
Rohan is interested
in Sam and David's
socially?conscious healthy food
company, Everytable,
but he has an issue with
their $20?million valuation.
Coming off of 18 to 20
is not really ??
it's not worth a counter,
to be honest.
You see where I'm at.
I'm fine if you want to counter
something above where I'm at,
but it's nowhere in the realm
of where you guys are at.
The truth is, Rohan, that
from the moment we walked in,
we were hoping
to get a deal with you.
We do think you could bring
a tremendous amount
of value to our brand,
and we'd be thrilled
to work with you.
We had a best and final
that we had pre?agreed on this.
We are gonna go better
than that,
and this is the best
we can do.
The ?? The best and final
is $1 million on $15 million.
So, okay, this is it, guys.
This is ?? This is ??
This is ?? This is the jam.
This is it. I get up and hug you
or it's peace out.
So, I'm saying, okay, my final,
no messing around,
$1 million
for 10% of the company.
That's it.
Now, it's got to be right now.
Polk: We're so excited
to be partnered with Rohan Oza,
and even more importantly,
we're excited
that we can use
his marketing skills
to bring an Everytable
into every single community
in the country.
I love when they tell you
you're the favorite
after you're the only one.
Cuban: The only one, right.
Yeah. You were obviously
my favorite going in.
Obviously.
