And I'm Bryan.
And we are fired up
to show you our new product.
Fired up.
We're seeking $50,000
for a 20% stake
in our business.
Campfires have been
a crucial part of men's life
since the beginning of time.
Yes, but campfires
are difficult
to start, maintain,
clean up,
and let's be honest ??
Stumbling around
in the middle of the night
looking for wood is never easy.
But we solved that problem.
Check this out.
We want her to know
what she's getting into, Mark.
Bryan: We ??
?Come on.
?Well, that's what you do
Brent and Bryan have one offer
on the table from Barbara
for their campfire?in?a?tin
product, Radiate.
I'm Julie from
Cornelius, North Carolina.
And I'm Ryan
from Gahanna, Ohio.
And we are here seeking
a $150,000 investment
for a 20% stake
in our company.
Sharks...
Julie.
Cuban: It's okay.
It's only the most important
day in your life.
Corcoran:
You got our name right.
I know, I know,
and you're right in the middle.
It freaks everybody out.
Yes, yes, yes.
And there's a new set!
Yes, yes, yes.
?Go again.
?Sharks.
Sharks...
Herjavec: Sharks.
...as humans, we have
all kinds of drink options
and ways to treat ourselves
throughout the day,
but our dogs, they only
ever have plain water.
How boring!
Right?
Boring.
All day, every day.
And while they see us
sipping on our sports drinks
and our lattes,
Fido gets...
plain old water.
?Wah?wah?wah.
?No, not anymore.
Let us introduce you
to Petrol Fuel for Dogs.
Petrol is a delicious,
hydrating,
vitamin?enhanced water
for dogs.
It's made of 100%
all?natural flavorings,
plus six added vitamins
and minerals
that are good for dogs'
overall health.
And dogs love it.
But, Sharks, you don't have
to just take our word for it.
We brought along today
one of our most
loyal customers...
We sure did.
...and her award?winning
agility dog to show you.
Corcoran: Here she comes. Wow.
Diane...
?[ Laughs ]
?...and Rrrrrrrocco!
?Rocco!
?Aww.
?Good one.
?Is that a shih tzu?
?Yeah.
?Yeah.
What an athlete!
Rocco!
Feed me.
Feed me now.
Aww.
Now, is Rocco thirsty,
or is the product that good?
Dogs lap it up
4 to 1 over regular water.
?Wow!
?Oh, wow!
[ Laughter ]
Herjavec: That is so cute!
Great job, guys.
Cuban: Good job. Thank you.
Julie:
Thank you, Diane and Rocco.
Can we, like, taste it?
Absolutely you can taste it.
Is it fine for humans, too?
We've certainly tasted it.
Oza:
Is it flavored?
It's n?? It has
all?natural flavors in it.
So, sweeter?
Uh, savory.
Savory!
That's never a good sign.
I'll just grab one?
Okay.
So, all?natural flavors.
There's a B?complex, biotin,
niacin, and L?carnitine.
Cute picture.
Thank you.
Great logo.
Ohh.
[ Chuckling ]
Oh, my God.
Make her drink it
from a bowl.
Cuban:
What's it taste like?
Totally not what I expected.
Oh, my God.
Okay.
It tastes like bone broth.
Yes.
Corcoran: Ew!
[ Laughing ] Oh!
It smells like bone broth.
Julie: I mean, it is
a dog product, right?
Well, dogs like bones.
It is a dog product.
So, Julie, I got to ask...
Yes.
...why?
I love dogs.
Sure.
Sure.
I know you do.
What's wrong with water?
Well, you know,
I want our dogs to enjoy
the variety of beverages
that we do, as well.
So, I found a veterinary
nutritionist to formulate it.
We worked on several different
flavor profiles, Lori,
and this one was the winner
out of all of them.
That would make sense.
What are you guys selling
at the moment?
What's the revenue,
and where are you selling
at the moment?
We did a crowdfunding campaign
a year ago,
and what that
allowed us to do,
and I'm ?? I'm gonna come back
to how we started,
and we had to take a break
and why ?? why we're back. Um...
Oh, you ?? you shut
the company down for a while?
I shel?? I shelved the company
for a little bit, so when you ??
Corcoran:
What's a little bit?
How many years ago
did you start?
Sure.
So, I honestly started
this journey, if you will,
about 10 years ago.
10?
2010, we went
to the largest trade show,
and we were overwhelmed
with the response that we got.
Did you ?? Did you have sales
during that time?
We had o?over a dozen companies
asking us to export the product.
We had no idea
how to do that.
We had no idea what
a container of product would be.
And so, we went to go to get
a small?business loan.
Everybody knows
what was going on in 2010.
There were
no small?business loans,
certainly not for a female
business owner at that time.
And so, we had to shelve it.
And you've decided
to bring this back to life.
When did that happen,
when you kicked it up again
to get it going?
So, honestly, it was ??
it was about 18 months ago.
So, it's a new company,
effectively.
?So, here you are.
?Correct. It's a new company.
Oza: Talk to me
about the new company.
That's what I care about.
Cuban: So, you started ??
you started again...
Yes.
...18 months ago.
Correct.
I brought Ryan
on board.
Ryan,
did you put money in it?
I'm a principal
in the business.
How much?
Yeah, I?I put in $25,000.
So what are your sales
for the last 18 months?
Go ahead.
Corcoran: Your sales.
Sales for the last 16 months
were $16,000.
Wow.
That's not great news.
Julie: We don't ?? We're ??
We're out of product.
So, we literally
don't have product,
which is why
we're here today.
We're at a crossroads here.
Why haven't you sold
anything else, unless...
We're out of product.
Wait. Okay, guys,
none of this is adding up.
Okay, here's the timeline
as I see it...
Oza: Let's back it up.
Yes.
...and why I have a problem.
First of all, you go
to a trade show 10 years ago.
Correct.
What happened
that allowed you
to fund it then?
I sold part of my 401(k).
?Oh.
?So, how much money
did you put in yourself
from your 401(k)?
$100,000.
Wow.
That's ??
Something's wrong there.
Out of that $100,000,
you didn't think
to save money for product
so you can deliver on orders?
Well, honestly, Mark,
at the time,
I really thought that
as a woman?owned business,
I would be able
to get funding.
We're talking green.
We're not talking
woman?owned business,
man?owned business,
Martian?owned business.
Mm?hmm.
We're talking common sense.
Right?
How much of the $100,000 did
you spend on the trade show?
Um, we spent about $10,000.
Uh, the trade ??
Then where did
the other $90,000 go?
What happened to the other
$90,000, Julie?
Th?The other $90,000 went
to the research,
the product run
cost a lot of money.
You had product,
so why didn't you sell that?
Sure.
We ?? We sold the product.
And then we gave,
as you know,
Julie, I'm always suspect of any
business that starts and stops.
Okay.
Because any business
I've ever seen that succeeded
started and kept going ??
somehow kept going.
So, for that reason,
I'm out.
I'm really sorry
to hear that.
I don't know
if dogs need this or not.
Is this something
people need and want?
Yes.
Is it something
they're going to buy?
?Yes.
?I'm not sure.
And for those reasons,
I'm out.
Oh, Lori,
I'm really sad to...
I'm sorry.
Ryan: Sure.
And you didn't do that.
That's why we're here.
You're here t??
You ?? You can't.
You're looking
for us to save you.
Cuban:
You're betting your whole ??
No, I'm not looking
for you to sa??
Yes.
How else would you do it?
What are you gonna do
if you don't get paid?
"A" ?? sales cures all.
Right?
If you don't have sales,
you don't have a business.
"B" ?? you have to anticipate
how you're gonna use your cash
to get to a point
of profitability.
You can't assume
you're gonna be able to get
a woman?owned business loan.
You can't assume that coming
here is gonna bail you out.
You have to plan,
knowing that this
is the only cash that you have.
You didn't do it the first time.
You're in the process
of not doing it the second time.
I don't see how anything
is gonna change going forward.
So, for those reasons, I'm out.
Good luck, guys.
Thank you.
Thank you.
?Thank you, guys.
?Sorry, you guys.
Th?This isn't the ?? the last
of us that you'll see.
?I hope you guys ??
?We wish you the best.
You know,
I tell my kids all the time ??
We wish you the best.
I hope you crush it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
Thank you.
Greiner: Good luck.
Robert,
as a dog lover...
?Thanks, guys.
?One last chance.
Thank you.
Barbara, one of five kids,
grew up in a similar...
[ Lori chuckles ]
Oh, you guys. Sorry.
...environment like you did.
Cuban: Sorry, guys.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
While this is another setback,
this is not the end
by any means.
Hopefully,
we'll see it on shelves
everywhere where there's
a human beverage soon.
We'll get 'em.
We'll get 'em.
All right?
We got 'em.
