Hi. My name is Joe Croft.
I'm from
San Clemente, California.
Joe,
does it have to be ??
Joe, what's your experience
in the eyewear business?
I spent a formative part
of my career at Oakley,
which,
as you guys probably know,
dominates the, uh,
performance category of sports.
How much
did you raise?
We, over the course of the
company, have raised $9 million.
Oh!
Greiner: Wow.
There, the rock
just got dropped there.
How much do you owe?
Me personally, at 20%.
Okay.
What happened
to the rest?
As you raise, you dilute.
You've had to continue
to raise money.
That means
something didn't work.
We really have only raised money
in two large tranches.
So we haven't raised any money
for the last several years.
The company is profitable,
right?
Joe, when I see
an entrepreneur
who has 20% stake
in the business,
I stop looking at them
as an entrepreneur, honestly.
I?I think of them as an employee
with an incentive.
It makes me feel
very uncertain.
Good luck, Joe.
Croft: All right.
No, there's me.
No, Lori's left.

I never ??
I didn't go out.
Wow.
Croft:
That ?? That is amazing.
Joe, you're in danger
of losing
the one deal
you have on the table.
The equity ?? H?Hold on.
We're ?? We're having
a nice discussion.
Lori ??
Joe, you're gonna lose
this discussion.

Joe, Joe,
I can't do the 2.5%.
Take my deal.
Are we up to ?? How about 4%?
I don't want to ??
Wow!
Joe.
Congratulations, Joe.
Oza:
Congratulations, Joe.
