Hi. My name is Joe Croft.
I'm from
San Clemente, California.
And I'm here asking for $750,000
in exchange for 5%
of my company, Gunnar Optiks.
Thank you, Joe.
And for you.
Thank you very much.
So, as you hold that out in
the computer?viewing distance,
you'll see
that the contrast is enhanced.
Yeah,
there's a difference.
You'll also
feel your eyes relax.
It blocks
the blue light, correct?
Absolutely.
In fact, we've
scientifically measured it.
We block 65% of the blue light
that's emitted
from all those screens.
So, yellow light
is more calming
and better
for the eyes?
So, there's a lot of science
that goes into
why yellow light is much better
and why blue light,
which is very close
to the UV part of the spectrum,
is high energy
and is actually damaging to you
and can disrupt
your sleep patterns.
So, let's get
right into the business.
Tell us about
your sales.
There's gonna be a lot of sales
with a $16 million valuation.
Last year, we sold $6.5 million
worth of eyewear.
Greiner: Wow.
Good for you.
Wow.
I like it.
What about this year?
This year, we're trending
towards $7.5 million.
We are approaching
60% gross margin.
That's great.
What's the average
price point?
The average price point
right now is around 60 to 80.
And are you making money,
and if so, how much?
The answer is yes.
And?
Last year, EBITDA was 500,000.
You're doing a 60% margin,
which is great.
But you only made
half a million EBITDA.
Where ??
Where's the cost going?
So, we are going to
build a brand.
We have penetrated
into the gaming category.
I was thinking for gamers,
this would be ??
Absolutely.
In fact ??
That's where your strength
has been, right?
Gaming is where
you basically deliver this?
With the gaming crowd,
we sponsor
a number of e?sports athletes.
E?sports is the wild West
right now.
Do you have a patent?
That is a great question
because we not only
have a patent,
we've got battle?tested IP.
We have gone toe to toe
with some of the largest people
in the industry out there.
We've gone into the courtroom
and come out victorious.
Joe,
does it have to be ??
Joe, what's your experience
in the eyewear business?
I spent a formative part
of my career at Oakley,
which,
as you guys probably know,
dominates the, uh,
performance category of sports.
How much
did you raise?
We, over the course of the
company, have raised $9 million.
Oh!
Greiner: Wow.
There, the rock
just got dropped there.
How much do you owe?
Me personally, at 20%.
Okay.
What happened
to the rest?
As you raise, you dilute.
You've had to continue
to raise money.
That means
something didn't work.
We really have only raised money
in two large tranches.
So we haven't raised any money
for the last several years.
The company is profitable,
right?
And ??
Okay, well,
good for you.
That's a good step.
A?Absolutely.
If you can give the numbers,
it might help.
Just rapidly
what your revenue has been.
Last year, 6.5.
The year prior,
we were $8 million.
$8 million?
Correct.
And the year prior
was about the same.
What are you gonna use
the money for?
Marketing.
That's a?a key thing.
We need to get the exposure out.
We are evangelists about how bad
people's eyes are becoming.
So, then,
you must have debt.
We do have debt.
How much?
How much debt?
Uh, 1.2.
Ooh.
Wow.
Joe, when I see
an entrepreneur
who has 20% stake
in the business,
I stop looking at them
as an entrepreneur, honestly.
I?I think of them as an employee
with an incentive.
It makes me feel
very uncertain.
Good luck, Joe.
Croft: All right.
No, there's me.
No, Lori's left.
[ Chatter ]
I never ??
I didn't go out.
Wow.
and Lori is Joe's last chance
at a deal
for his computer?safe
eyewear company, Gunnar Optiks.
When you put
those glasses on,
two things
I noticed happened.
One, that irritating blue light
is gone.
Two, it's much clearer,
and it's almost like
the letters get bigger
and more defined.
Very interesting to me
because I have sold
a product called Neox,
Neox sunglasses.
I've sold probably
$30 million worth of them.
My concern here is that
you have a lot of debt.
You don't have
a lot of equity.
I see a solution.
I see the solution is
I do feel TV is what you need.
You need
the demonstration
because once you look
through them, you're sold.
I'm gonna give you
a flier,
but it's going to
be this.
Wow.
I'm going to give you
$375,000 as an investment,
$375,000 as a loan
at 8%,
for...8%.
Hey, I?I ??
And I'll try
to blow it up for you.
That's a no?brainer.
Croft:
That ?? That is amazing.
I love the fact that we have
an offer on the table, and ??
The only offer
on the table.
That is the only offer
on the table.
Herjavec: [ Laughs ]
I feel confident
that I can sell these.
Good.
And I know you can.
Out of respect
to our current investment base,
because just like you would
want me to care for your money,
I need to care for the money
of our current investors.
Taking that much of the company
would be tough
for those current investors.
What if I gave you the 750K
all as a loan at 8%
and I take 5%?
Listen.
I see me
as a great lifeline for you
because you need
awareness.
You really need
awareness.
You know your margins.
We know our margins,
absolutely.
So you know how much more
you have to sell
to pay back
the $750,000.
That 750K coming in
is beautiful.
We love it.
The equity slice just seems
a little bit rich.
I'd love to counter with 2.5%
on the equity slice.
Ooh.
Wow.
2.5?
You came in here
offering 5.
Exactly,
5 for 750 straight...
You can't go backwards.
...str?straight equity.
You're dealing with
one of
the biggest brand builders
in America here.
And we know that.
We respect that.
I wouldn't
nickel?and?dime it.
Like, you want to go from
6 to 60, not from 6 to 7.
I wouldn't
play with fire.
The 2.5%
is just so small.
Is there somewhere
in the middle there?
Are you really gonna do that
for just 2.5%?
I wouldn't
nickel?and?dime it.
Your dilution
is minimal.
Yeah.
Again, I?I ?? I'm ??
I'm asking the question
'cause we really want
to get a deal done,
and quite frankly ??
Then say yes to the 5%
if you really want to do a deal.
Say yes.
The only reason I mentioned
the equity is with that growth
and, again, being in a space
where there's a ton
of imminent activity ??
Joe, you're in danger
of losing
the one deal
you have on the table.
The equity ?? H?Hold on.
We're ?? We're having
a nice discussion.
Lori ??
Joe, you're gonna lose
this discussion.
[ Chatter ]
Joe, Joe,
I can't do the 2.5%.
Take my deal.
Are we up to ?? How about 4%?
I don't want to ??
Wow!
Joe.
You're nickeling?and?diming.
My hand is out.
Congratulations, Joe.
Oza:
Congratulations, Joe.
