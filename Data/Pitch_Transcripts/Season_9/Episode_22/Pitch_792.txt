[ Italian accent ] So, Sharks,
my name is Alessandro,
and I'm the co?founder
of Avocaderia.
I am seeking $300,000 in
exchange for 10% of my company.
Wow.
Growing up in Italy,
as you might have guessed,
I always had access
to healthy and fresh food.
When I moved to the U. S.,
I realized that, uh, you know,
people were becoming
more and more aware
about what they were eating,
and healthy food
was not just an option.
It was a priority for them.
Unfortunately, the alternatives
were pretty bland.
I kept running into
the same few options
of the so?called healthy
but frivolous meals.
So one day,
I decided to make myself
one of those famous
avocado toast,
and, man, it was delizioso.
[ Laughs ]
So, what really got me
is that avocados are the perfect
match between healthy and tasty.
That's how the idea
for Avocaderia was born.
Of course, every item
on our menu contains ??
you guessed it ?? avocados.
[ Laughter ]
We offer a seasonal
rotating menu,
composed of toast,
salads and bowls, and smoothies.
Our current top seller ??
also my favorite ??
is the Mediterranean toast,
a warm, savory toast
made with olive tapenade,
avocado mash,
cherries and ripe tomatoes...
Ah!
...feta, and pistachio dukkah.
Yes, it's really good.
Oh, my God.
All our dishes are designed
to look as good as they taste.
So, Sharks,
we are ripe for success.
Are you ready to take your bite?
All: Yes.
Perfect.
I love your accent.
I'm in.
Herjavec: Andiamo!
[ Laughter ]
So, you are
without feta...
Okay, perfect.
...because I was told
you prefer without.
You are
a smart man.
[ Light laughter ]
Yours is with feta.
Yes.
Enjoy.
Thank you.
It's amazing.
I'm gonna tell you what ??
what's on that, as well.
I'm hungry.
Greiner: Oh, my God.
So good.
Yours is also
without feta.
Yes, sir.
There you go.
Corcoran: Mm.
Nicely presented. Thank you.
Herjavec: Oh,
that looks fancy.
Appreciate it.
Enjoy.
Grazia.
Prego.
It's a pleasure.
Hey!
Oh, it's good.
That is really,
really good.
The Mediterranean toast?
Corcoran: Mmm.
It's really good.
Alessandro:
So, what ?? what you're sampling
is, uh, the Mediterranean toast.
The other one is the beet toast,
which is a vegan option.
It's made with beet hummus,
a slice of avocado,
arugula, and spice seeds.
That's terrific,
as well.
And then ?? [ Laughs ]
And then
we have the mango smoothie,
and finally,
the chocolate mousse,
which is also
a vegan chocolate mousse.
It doesn't contain any milk,
so...
With avocado?
Of course. Everything ??
Corcoran:
Is this how you ??
Is this how you present
your meals at the restaurant?
That's correct.
Beautifully presented.
[ Speaking indistinctly ]
A restaurant right now because
we are inside the food hall.
We're in a very cool space,
uh, in Sunset Park in Brooklyn.
So, how long
have you been in business?
We started five months ago.
What did you do this last month
in business?
Uh, we did $75,000.
How much did it cost you
to open the store?
Uh, we invested about $70,000
in total.
Oh, that's great.
Because we were able ??
Do you have any photos
of the restaurant
that we could see?
Of course, we have some photos.
So, this is the outside.
The branding for us
is very important.
We have neon lights...
It's cute.
...because we wanted the place
to be very alive,
to make people that work inside
happy to be there.
You know, it's not
another chain, you know.
Corcoran:
That looks yummy.
You know, like,
another place ??
That ??
I'd like one of those.
How much
is the toast?
So, the ?? all ?? all our prices
vary from $6 to $14,
so the price point
is made to be affordable.
Alessandro,
what's your background?
Are you a food guy
or are you a design guy?
I was born in ??
So, I was born in Tuscany,
grew up in Modena,
and then I worked
in a public investment bank
for about one year,
then I moved to consulting.
Realized it was not for me,
and so last year, I moved to ??
to Seattle because I was
managing a new company,
and I really felt
it was really hard for me
to find good food to eat
every single day,
you know, and, uh,
so I'm actually not the ??
the best chef out there,
even though I'm Italian,
so I should be, but...
[ Laughs ]
...I started making myself
this avocado toast,
and I fell in love
because you know what?
It made me feel very healthy,
and by the same time,
they're very filling because
avocado is a fatty fruit, yes.
So, like, what's the plan
here? We're gonna ?? multiples,
are you gonna franch??
Like,
what's the game plan?
Yes, absolutely.
So, we're already opening
a second one
in, uh, in Chelsea in New York.
In a food court,
as well?
Correct.
And, uh, the idea is for us
to open 20 locations
directly owned
in the next five years.
Cuban:
How much does this ??
How much money do you need
to open 20 locations?
So, uh, basically,
for each location,
we estimate an average
of about $200,000.
But you opened the last one
for $70,000.
Correct
because that's in a food hall.
So,
for an independent restaurant,
we need $200,000 because half
of that is for the build now.
Okay, but you're looking
for $300,000.
That's correct.
We want to open
one independent restaurant
and one in a food hall.
The food hall
are cheaper for us.
So that takes care
of the $300,000.
Correct.
Where are you
gonna get the money
to open up
the other 20?
So, the idea is to ??
gross sales ??
we're projecting
to close this year at $750,000
as we open the second place.
Next year, we, of course,
are planning to do $4.3 million,
and at that point...
What?!
...the idea...
How does that happen
so quickly?
We are already opening the
second one with our own money,
so we already put ourselves
$170,000 of our own savings.
Why is it worth
$3 million...
Yes.
...today
with one location?
So, we are already
making profit.
We received about 50 requests
for franchising already.
We're not planning
to do that yet.
Also we have a deal
for a cookbook,
which is actually
in the six figures.
You already have
that money?
Correct.
We're using that to open ??
to finance a second location.
Are you planning to open
all these in the New York area?
Yes.
The idea is to open ??
is to open the first locations
all in the New York area,
then the other target cities
are L. A., San Diego,
Miami, and, uh, Texas, as well,
so those are the ??
You know, um, I have to say,
this was delicious.
And I think
it's a really great mission
to have healthy food.
My only problem with it
is one thing.
Everything has to be
about avocados.
And I like avocados.
Yep.
But I'm not
a huge avocado fan.
And for that reason solely,
I am out.
I appreciate that.
Thank you so much.
So, Alessandro, you've done
an amazing job. I love the menu.
I love
everything of it.
But the valuation for me
is not $3 million.
I can't argue
with your accent.
[ Chuckles ]
I'm out today.
Thank you, Robert.
I appreciate that.
Great idea.
We'll wait for you
in New York.
[ Laughs ]
Oza: You have, um,
amazing energy,
a great vibe,
all very good.
I?I want to jump in.
Yes.
Like, I'm leaning
to jump in.
I think my problem
is very similar to Lori,
is the entire menu
is avocado?based.
So the minute I get
a little avocado?fatigued...
Yep.
...which is ??
happens to me
in food and beverage
all the time...
Right.
...I'm out.
And so then
I'm not coming back
because the variety isn't there
for things non?avocado.
Yep.
So even though I love you
and it's very catchy,
for that reason,
I'm out.
Great job, Alessandro.
Thank you.
Bye?bye. Whoo?hoo!
Grazie. Ciao!
Greiner: Congrats.
Ssss!
[ Speaks Italian ]
I am absolutely
living the American dream
with partners like this,
and I'm sure that Barbara
would bring a lot on the table,
given their experience
in the real?estate world,
and Mark, as well, is gonna
help us grow the business,
scale it very fast
and make it very successful.
