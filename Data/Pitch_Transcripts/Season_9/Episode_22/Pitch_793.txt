I'm Dr. Catlin Powers,
and my product is SolSource.
I'm here today to offer you
an exclusive deal ??
3% of my company for $500,000.
Wow.
We all love fun in the sun,
those long summer days outdoors,
grilling up delicious food.
But how many times
have you gone to grill
and realized that
you're completely out of fuel
or that you have to
scrape the soot off first?
Fuel ?? it's time?consuming,
it's expensive, it's heavy,
and it leaves cancer?causing
particles on your food.
But what if I told you
you could cook delicious food
100% fuel?free?
Introducing SolSource,
a grill powered 100% by the sun.
Our classic SolSource model
is fast, powerful, and durable.
It heats up to 500 degrees
Fahrenheit in seconds
and can cook a meal
in just 10 minutes.
Our SolSource Sport model
features a lightweight,
compact design
that packs down
into a 2?foot carrying case
so that you can cook anything
anywhere under the sun.
Hmm.
With SolSource,
you can save money,
save time, and save energy,
all while cooking delicious food
100% fuel?free
and pollution?free.
So, Sharks, who wants to power
your next barbecue
with solar energy?
Let's do it.
Yeah. [ Chuckles ]
Herjavec:
How much sun do I need,
and how long does it take
for it to get up to heat?
As long
as you can see your shadow,
you can cook with SolSource,
and it heats up five times
faster than a charcoal grill.
So, for those of us who are
grilling?challenged, right...
Yes.
...and need a sense
of temperature and time...
Yes.
...are there
any temperature gauges at all
or any way to ??
to judge the temperature?
You can add
a temperature gauge in.
We don't currently offer that
as part of the system,
but it's an easy add?on.
But how are you knowing
and gauging ??
like, when you have a gas grill,
you can see ??
turn it up,
turn it down.
How do you
control that?
Is there any way
to moderate it at all?
You can moderate it down
by covering pieces of the panel.
You can moderate it up by having
additional panels on the outside
that go up and down.
Oza: Break down
the numbers for me.
What do you
sell it for?
$249 for the solar system,
$499 for the ??
Are you giving us retail
or cost right now?
Retail. Retail.
Retail.
So,
$249 and how much?
$499.
We have 80% margins,
and we sell direct.
Wow.
Okay.
Oza: How did you come up
with this idea?
I mean, clearly, the doctor part
had something to do with it.
I have degrees in chemistry
and environmental health.
I got my doctoral degree
from Harvard University,
and 10 years ago,
I went up into the Himalayas
to do
a scientific research project,
and I ended up developing
this company instead.
And the reason is that
a local family
invited me into their home,
and it turned out
that the air they were breathing
in their home
was 10 times more polluted
than the air in Beijing,
simply from cooking
their afternoon meal.
What I found ?? every year,
more people are dying
from smoke exposure
inside their homes
just from cooking
than AIDS and malaria combined,
4.3 million people.
No way.
Wow.
Wow.
Once I learned this,
I couldn't go back
to my research as normal.
I left my research
and I started working with
the nomadic families there
to try to find a solution.
How many
have you sold to date?
So, we've done 1.3 million
in sales.
Wow.
Cuban: Okay, so,
what did you do last year?
Uh, last year,
we did 100K.
Herjavec: That's it?
So, let me tell you guys about
the trajectory of our company
over time.
Yes, please.
Okay.
We started out
up in the Himalayas.
We built a barter?based business
because most of our customers
had no cash income,
so we bartered our solar stoves
for agricultural goods,
and we delivered by horse
and yak and motorcycle
when we needed to
in order to reach our customers.
Of course.
You're the only product
we've ever had here
that delivered by yak.
[ Chuckles ]
So, we were building
a profitable, growing business
up in the Himalayas,
and then we ran
right into the middle
of a very big problem,
which is ethnic conflict.
We had military lockdown.
Wow.
Our profit margins
dropped to negative $4 per unit.
Our team was being threatened,
so I made the very challenging,
soul?wrenching decision
to completely change
our business model,
and ?? oh, gosh ??
it was probably the hardest time
that I faced in my life,
was those periods.
Uh...
Why?
Because of seeing what
our customers were going through
and knowing that there was
nothing we could do about it.
I've almost died twice
in the course of this business,
both from parasite illnesses,
so I was not doing well
from a health perspective
during that time.
Did you move
to America then?
Yes.
So, that has been the transition
that we have been in.
We've been selling
through our own website
and on Amazon, as well.
And this year,
you think you'll do...?
S?? We will hit around half a
million by the end of this year.
Why the jump?
What ??
What accelerated it?
Producing this product.
So this product ??
When was this product released?
Last month.
It's been amazing, the response
that we've gotten from people.
This is a new reflector material
that's 92% energy?efficient.
We have utility patents
on the designs of our product,
on our new materials
that we've developed,
but our next product
is a solar battery system.
It stores energy
in organic molecules
over multiple days at a time,
a lot like plants do.
It's a natural
biomimicry system,
and that system will allow us
to cook at night
and also cook indoors.
So, of all the things you
could do with your technology,
why a grill
when you could be changing
the world much more quickly,
harnessing the sun
to create energy?
I see
working in the consumer markets
as a way
of iterating the technology
to make it
an amazing technology...
But you realize ??
...and then using it to go
to those other application.
So you're fighting
two battles then, right?
You're fighting your technology
battle for efficiency.
Mm.
And then
you're fighting
the consumer marketing side,
right?
Which is
even more expensive.
You know, it seems
you're pretty brilliant
and you take
a lot of risks.
The problem for me today
is barbecuers, they ??
they are into that taste
and that smell, right?
So, for today,
I have to be out.
Thank you for that.
Herjavec: You know,
one of my favorite sayings is,
"Every time
you see a small business,
someone made
a courageous decision."
Your entire journey
is all about courage.
Mm.
But you have
an incredible technology,
yet you want
to pitch us a grill.
It makes me
not trust the presentation.
It doesn't add up for me.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Yeah. We ?? We have a number
of different aspects
to our business, so when ??
Corcoran: No, but hold it
right there, if I may.
Oh, yes.
You just
proved his point.
Uh, what is odd to me
is you have an answer
to everything immediately,
and it's all even.
I feel like
I'm with a robot here,
a really smart robot,
but it does leave me stressed.
There's nothing wrong with
having an answer for everything.
I ?? By the way,
I'm ?? I'm ?? I'm fine ??
I'm fine with your I. Q.
Greiner: Other people
may think that's good.
But I can say to you
I actually find it unbelievable
what you're asking
for this business.
I'm just not a believer.
I'm out.
Mm.
You know, Barbara,
I really appreciate
your perspective on that.
