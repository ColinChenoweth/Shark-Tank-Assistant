My name
is Jordan DeCicco,
and I am the founder
and youngest brother of Sunniva.
To my right
is my middle brother,
my co?founder,
Jake DeCicco.
[ Laughs ]
To my left
is our oldest brother
and our CEO,
Jimmy DeCicco.
We grew up
in Kingston, New York,
and we created
the world's first...
super coffee.
Super coffee.
Herjavec: Okay.
[ Laughter ]
Today, we are asking for
a $500,000 investment
for a 4.5% stake
in our business.
[ Laughs ]
As college athletes,
we were always tired.
Our coaches were unhappy
because we were falling asleep
in class after morning workouts,
and our school stores
offered only the usual,
unhealthy, bottled coffees
and energy drinks.
But the three of us
refused to put that garbage
into our bodies.
We thought
that there has to be
a healthy
energy alternative.
So, in our youngest brother's
dorm room,
we brewed
something better ??
organic Colombian
coffee beans
blended with 10 grams
of lactose?free protein
and healthy fats from
coconut oil for lasting fuel.
Like that,
Super Coffee was born.
Jordan dropped out of school,
Jimmy left his job,
our poor mother
shed a few tears,
but we were determined
to share our super coffee
with the world.
Jimmy:
Over the last 18 months,
we've come a long way from
our little brother's dorm room,
and we've created
a product
that people want
because it works,
and we have the sales
to prove it.
Sharks, as athletes,
we are looking for a coach
to help us refine
our business fundamentals
and share our super coffee
with the world.
All right, guys,
let's try some super coffee.
Greiner: Yep.
Cuban:
Let's do it.
Yeah.
[ Laughs ]
Will I
feel super afterwards?
All day long.
[ Laughs ]
Okay.
Got a few options
for you guys.
You can see the flavor banners
there for each one.
I love when you give us
lots of little things to try.
Barbara.
Thank you,
my friend.
Oh, you're welcome.
Herjavec: Thank you.
So, you have
the vanilla bean,
which is
our top?selling flavor.
Then we have
our maple hazelnut,
which is
my personal favorite,
and we have
our dark mocha,
and then an unsweetened,
sugar?free black brew.
[ Chuckling ] Whoa.
I just had that one.
[ Laughter ]
Yeah. That'll wake you up,
Rohan. That'll get you going.
The taste profile
is great.
Awesome.
I'm still getting
some back end, though.
Whoa.
What do you have
in here, stevia?
So, yeah, you get a little bit
of organic maple syrup
and then a little bit
of organic stevia.
Why do I not like it?
Because you're not
a millennial.
[ Laughter ]
Oh!
Whoa!
Bam!
Well, I'm out.
I'm out.
So, Jordan, you said you have
the sales to prove it.
Wow us.
We've done $600,000
to date.
This is just
our second year of business,
and we're gonna do $2.1 million
in sales this year.
Wow.
Corcoran: I'd like to know
how you're gonna get there.
So ?? So ??
You've done $600,000?
That's a big jump.
That's right.
We actually
just partnered
with the world's largest
food?service provider,
so we're putting it
in corporate cafeterias
at offices
and on college campuses.
We're in Whole Foods.
We're in Target.
Greiner: Oh.
We're in Wegmans,
and we're in Wawa.
Wow.
How did you do that?
And then ??
People love the stuff.
It's ?? I mean, we're the w??
So, let me step back
to food service real quick.
Yeah.
So, with the world's largest
food?service provider...
Cuban:
Which is...
...the Compass Group.
They do
$20 billion annually,
and we signed a national
partnership with the company.
Give me, year to date,
what's your revenue been so far?
$400,000 in 150 accounts.
So in
the next six months,
you guys expect
to do $1.7 million?
Is that correct?
Yes.
So, so, guys,
my background is in beverages,
so I was involved
in vitamin water,
so, SmartWater, Bai ??
All very early?stage companies
went on to become
billion?dollar exits,
so I'm looking
on "Shark Tank"
for the next
billion?dollar exit.
That starts
with a few things.
Give me your margins.
How much are you making it for?
What are you
selling it for?
And where are you making this
at the moment?
Absolutely.
So, we have a 43% gross margin,
which is pretty good for ??
for the beverage category.
So your cost,
your total cost to goods is...?
A dollar and 5 cents
a bottle. That's
ingredients, that's label,
that's blending, that's boxing,
pallets, all that stuff.
And then the cost?
We sell it to distributors
for $1.85.
Our price on the shelf
is $3.29.
So, $3.29 compared to
your competitor ??
how much are they?
So, a Starbucks product
is gonna be right around $2.99.
Right.
And then
where we talk about
this new,
enhanced category.
This is really
what makes us different.
If you see products
that are using the protein
and the coconut oil
and butter,
those products
on the shelf at Whole Foods
that are, like, cold?pressed,
are gonna be $4.99 to $7.99.
Cuban:
You found a niche, right?
It's like, okay,
we're gonna be cheaper,
we're gonna be healthier,
we're gonna be sweet but
relatively low?calorie, right?
Exactly.
Yep.
Cuban: To play
towards millennial.
I get that, but let's talk about
the cash required.
How much
have you guys raised?
We've raised
$1.3 million,
most recently
at a $7 1/2 million valuation.
Okay.
Okay, so, I'm in investor
in Bulletproof Coffee.
It's one of the most
iconic coffees out there.
I'm keen to try and ??
I don't have to
just do Bulletproof.
But what are you guys doing
that's breaking through
that's a real
category?changer?
Because I see some of
these things out there already.
Exactly, Rohan. So, so,
Bulletproof is a ?? a
little bit different target,
I would say,
a little bit older audience.
For us, if ??
if you're looking at
the R. T. D. coffee space
right now,
95% of it is Starbucks.
That's it.
There's not
a lot of competition out there,
but it is
the fastest?growing category
in beverage space
right now.
If you ask
a lot of our consumers,
they're seeing something
that's affordable,
that they like,
that they like the taste,
only 7 grams of sugar
from organic maple syrup.
So, guys, you ??
you've ?? you've done
$400,000 year to date.
That's right.
Oza: I know you got a lot
of new accounts coming on.
But as my venerable Sharks here
have taught me over time,
that's yet to come.
We'd like to know
what's in the bank today.
So,
$400,000 so far.
And if my rudimentary math
is right,
you're looking to give away
5% for $500,000.
Is that right?
That's right.
4.5.
So you're putting
a $10 million valuation
on a company that's done
$400,000 this year.
That's right.
Yeah, but ??
Oza: By the way,
and I've been part
of some
ridiculous valuations,
and this is sporty
even by my standard.
No, I understand,
but we're not a mature company.
We're not Bai.
Bai got acquired
for 6X,
their ?? their revenue
at $275 billion.
But that's the point.
You're not.
We're just getting started,
and that's why we're here.
We have the inventory.
We have the accounts.
We need your money
to hire sales reps
and get this product
out there.
But that value, guys.
Talk to me. I mean ??
If ??
Ro, if we do $2 million,
if we do $2.1 million
in revenue this year,
you guys are getting a deal,
and we are going to ??
Yeah, but if I was
four inches taller, I'd
clean up, but that's ??
[ Laughter ]
That's an "if."
Jimmy: It's not an "if."
The distribution is there.
If we don't add
another account,
we're gonna do
$800,000 in sales this year.
We just added Target.
We added Wegmans.
We added Wawa.
You know,
I've invested in
two different beverage companies
on "Shark Tank,"
and I've never seen my money
go out the door faster
and never come back.
[ Laughter ]
It's an expensive game.
Uh,
but you're different.
Uh, first of all,
each of those two businesses
was headed by,
uh, one dynamic entrepreneur.
Here, I get three
for the price of one.
Not bad.
[ Laughs ]
And to your great credit, uh,
you're enormously disciplined,
and you have
high energy.
It's obvious how ??
how you feel about your product.
Um, so, I'm very much inclined
to go into the deal.
Okay?
Herjavec: Ooh!
Except one
little problem.
Ooh.
Barbara seems interested
in the DeCicco brothers'
protein?enhanced coffee drink,
Sunniva, but there's an issue.
I'm very much inclined
to go into the deal.
Okay?
Herjavec: Ooh!
Except one
little problem.
Ooh.
I want to take my pen
and keep scraping my tongue
'cause I keep having
that aftertaste,
and I've been
sipping my water,
trying to get that
out of my mouth,
and it seems like
every time I sip the water,
that creamy,
not likable ??
sorry ?? taste
gets enhanced all over
and I go back
to square one.
I think
when it comes down to a drink,
the most important quality
is how I respond to the taste,
and for that
one little reason alone,
I have to pass.
You're wonderful guys,
though.
I'm out.
Cuban:
Look, guys.
You've got a great name
that's eye?catching
and will
make people interested.
You've got
a competitive price.
You're the lowest cost provider
in this category.
All those things
are great.
But the more success you have,
the more expensive it becomes
to turn this into a profitable
and a sellable company.
I ?? I'm just not ready
to make
a $10, $25, or $50 million
investment in this category,
so for those reasons,
I'm out.
Thank you.
Before we get
to you guys,
I just want to say
we have the manufacturing.
We have
the distribution.
We have the product,
the team in place.
And you said that,
clearly, yeah.
Jimmy: Right,
but what we don't have
is ?? is the influence,
and that's why we're here.
We're at the tipping point
of this thing.
We've come so far
from this dorm room,
and we want to share it
with America.
Guys, you ever
heard the saying,
"The dream is free but
the hustle is sold separately"?
Well, you guys
have the hustle,
and I love that.
You have
a smart idea.
I think
it's right on trend.
But my concern ??
it's a high valuation.
At the moment,
I have to be out.
