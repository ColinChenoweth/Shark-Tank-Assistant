My name
is Scott Houdashell,
but you can call me
the Easter Bunny.
Houdashell:
Since we were kiddos...
Little baby bunnies.
Houdashell:
It's simple, creative...
Herjavec: Yeah!
McGill: So, Sharks,
who wants to join us
McGill:
Bye, Pickle.
Hop on out of here.
Cuban: Bye.
Good job, guys.
Love you.
Greiner: Bye.
Bye, Sport.
Thanks.
So, tell us how
you dreamt this up.
It was Easter 2015,
decorating in the kitchen,
Herjavec: I'm sorry, Curtis.
What else would they be for?
Our sister product.
Oh, you haven't told us
about another product.
Another product?
Oh, it's ??
Houdashell: Our sister product
is the
TreeMendous Ornament Decorator.
We love puns.
The TreeMendous
Ornament Decorator
is a sister product
to the Egg.
That we have no proof
of concept, in terms of sales.
We have $680,000
worth of sales.
How did you do ??
Is that a one?way sale?
One?way purchase orders,
absolutely.
Curtis, can I see
a Christmas ornament?
Is this gonna be your first
season with the Christmas?
This is
our first season.
That ?? That just got here
from our manufacturer.
Thank you.
But you don't really know
what the actual sell?through
is going to be on those yet?
This one, we do not have
actual sell?through yet.
Greiner:
To the consumer, right?
Cuban: Right. Right.
What do you charge
for this?
$30.
Houdashell:
We appreciate everyone.
Take mine.
We appreciate...

Damn it.
Congratulations, guys.

Herjavec:

Congrats.
Yeah.
You can step on
the bunny ears.
I don't want them.
[ Laughs ]
You good?
Yeah,
I'm good.

McGill:
It means the world to me.
My best friend just ??
just did what he's been
capable of all his life.
