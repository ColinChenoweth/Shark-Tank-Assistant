My name
is Katherine Saltzberg.
And I'm Lauri Fraser.
Our company
is Hugo's Amazing Tape.
And we
are seeking $50,000
for 50% equity
in our company.
Wow.       Wow.
Wow.                        Wow.
5?0?
Si, señor.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[ Chuckles ]
And this tape
truly is amazing,
and it will solve
all of your sticky situations.
Uh?oh.
This tape
has no adhesive,
so it sticks
to nothing...
but itself.
And it is
super?duper strong.
Take it, Lauri.
I'll take it, Kathy.
Pull, pull, pull.
[ Laughter ]
Herjavec: No!
Pull it!
[ Grunting ]
Thank you!
Okay.
And it will not
come apart...
until you...
take it apart.
Cuban: Wow.
Corcoran:
Pretty cool.
Herjavec:
Oh, that's cool.
And...
Stop the madness.
[ Chuckles ]
There's more madness.
It leaves
no sticky residue.
Cuban: No!
Yes.
And it's reusable.
If this
was any other kind of tape,
it would be history,
a memory,
but it's Amazing Tape
and it goes right back
to the way that it was.
Hugo's Amazing Tape
is extremely versatile,
with hundreds of uses,
and we're gonna show you
right now.
[ Greiner chuckles ]
Ooh!
Traveling potluck
won't spill in my car,
and it can go in the freezer
and the microwave.
Ah!
[ Southern accent ] Oh,
I just love the way
that it goes around
my embroidery threads,
keeps them
from unraveling.
[ New York accent ]
Sharks, you ever pick up a
power tool and no juice?
[ Laughs ]
You want it,
you unwrap it.
You're done,
you wrap it. Done.
Done.
[ New York accent ] Done.
[ New York accent ] Done.
[ British accent ] Oh, listen,
you know something?
It's wonderful
around your plants.
[ Normal voice ]
Wires and cables everywhere.
[ Sobbing ]
Until Hugo's
helped me get organized.
[ Irish accent ] You
know something? Oh, Mark,
Mark, this one's for you.
You know how sometimes
the kids ??
they're always losin'
the basketball pump?
Well,
you take some Amazing Tape,
and you just wrap it around,
keep them together.
Kath?
[ Normal voice ]
Yeah?
Wrapping paper.
Oh,
wrapping paper!
Wrapping paper.
This is the best way.
People love Amazing Tape
around wrapping paper.
Yeah.
As you can see, Sharks,
the applications are endless,
and the markets
are wide?open.
And we are an...
all?season item!
All?season item!
Yes!                        Yes!
We know
you're gonna use it.
Want some samples?
Yes.
[ British accent ]
I do love giving samples.
[ Applause ]
Wow.
Greiner:
Most entertaining.
Thank you.
There you go,
Mark.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Lori.
Thank you,
Lauri.
Thank you.
Mr. Wonderful.
O'Leary: Thank you so much.
Thanks.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Corcoran:
Thank you.
Robert.
Thank you,
Lauri.
Thank you.
Wow,
it really works.
Corcoran: Wow.
Really does.
Oh, so,
you have to tell us,
first off,
who created it and how.
And who's that guy
in the photo?
Herjavec: And why is it
called Hugo's?
[ Normal voice ]
Hugo is our dad.
Our dad.
Cuban:
You're sisters?
We're sisters.
Yeah.
You're sisters?
Yes.
Yeah.
Our ?? Our father
created this.
Yeah.
And our father
passed away this year.
Right.
Greiner:
Oh, I'm sorry.
Cuban:
I'm sorry.
Yeah, me, too.
And so he invented it about,
would you say 20 years ago?
Oh, wow.
He was
a very creative guy.
Really creative.
And he stumbled across
this tape.
Someone had shipped
something to him.
But he said,
"This stuff is amazing."
He started to do it.
And so
he had it rolled ??
O'Leary: So,
he didn't invent it?
It's PVC.
He made a use for it.
Right, but ??
You know, he took that material
to somebody and said,
"I want to make something,
but I want it to be what you ??"
Herjavec: All right,
so, more directly,
do you or your dad
own the patent for this?
The patent expired
with my father.
Greiner:
I was gonna say.
Yes. Yes.
They only last
20 to 23 years, depending.
20 years.
Both: Yes.
Greiner:
Where are you selling them?
Okay.
And how much
does it cost?
Okay.
We are selling it right now,
uh, online,
and just out of my trunk
at a swap meet,
wherever we can...
Yes, yeah.
...because we both have
other businesses.
That's the packaging?
Is that
the package there?
Cuban:
Could you pass that out?
Yes.
And we'll pass it ??
We'll pass it down here.
And so they come in
1/2?inch, 1?inch,
and 2?inch rolls.
Saltzberg:
That's fine. Yeah.
Okay.
Okay, so, here's 3 feet,
one meter.
We buy that for $1.27,
and it sells for $12.99.
Oh,
that's expensive.
$12.99?
Yes.
Herjavec: What were
the biggest year of sales?
Like, how much was he selling
in his best year?
The ?? The numbers
were very unclear, okay?
O'Leary: Unclear?
$68,000 was the most
they made in a year.
Since, we've sold,
what, $500,000...
Yes.
...since 2011.
'11.
Okay, what about
the last 12 months?
Uh...
$27,500.
$27,500.
Do you have a secret formula,
or do ??
does somebody
make this for you?
And can I call those people
and buy it myself?
Okay.
Cuban: Do you ??
Yeah, do you have ??
I'm not sure about all
this. That's another
reason why we're here.
O'Leary: Yes, you can.
You can call the ??
Where's it manufactured?
O'Leary: I could ?? I could call
those people myself.
Taiwan.
Taiwan?
Taiwan.
Oh, then it's definitely
ripped off.
O'Leary: Of course.
Right? Yeah.
Corcoran:
Is this your full?time job?
[ Chuckles ]
Katherine, Lauri,
I love how you're doing it
with the memory of your dad,
but I'm not sure
what the business is.
You lost me on the patent,
how you're distributing it.
I?I got to tell you,
this is so crazy a story
that it's perfect
for one of the Sharks here.
Oh, I ?? I have to ??
And I appreciate ??
Not me, not me.
I'm out.
Saltzberg: Yeah.
And I took it off,
and there's no residue
on the glass whatsoever.
Thank you.
Yes.
What I think you have here
is a business you ought
to get rid of, honestly.
It's a potential business
that neither of you
really want to wrestle with.
I'm out, so...
O'Leary: Ooh, well,
it's not over yet.
Herjavec: Surprising.
Mark and Lori, are you ready
for Hugo's Amazing Tape?
Mark and I
have been talking.
We have an offer
to make you
because we think
this has a lot of potential.
A lot of risk.
But a lot of potential.
Ooh.
What we'd like to do
is buy the entire company...
Whoa.
Herjavec: Wow.
Lauri, Lauri,
calm down, it's okay.
Okay.
Okay.
This is amazing.
Saltzberg: Our father, Hugo,
would be so incredibly proud.
This one's for you.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Sniffles ] Yeah.
I got to ask,
with all the problems we heard,
why did you guys buy
the entire company?
Cuban:
I loved it.
It's first to market.
That's what it's all about.
That's what
we're really good at.
You just paid 100 grand
for basically poop on a stick.
[ Laughter ]
I'm not kidding.
[ Muffled ]
It's poop on a stick.
It's a very bad deal.
