My name
is Scott Houdashell,
but you can call me
the Easter Bunny.
And I'm Curtis McGill.
We are
from Amarillo, Texas,
and our product is
The Eggmazing Egg Decorator.
We are here
seeking $350,000
Houdashell:
Since we were kiddos...
Little baby bunnies.
...moms and dads
and grandmas and grandpas
have been using
the same old traditional methods
to decorate
Easter eggs.
It's so smelly
and messy
that some families
don't even want to bother.
Well, Sharks, we have
an egg?cellent alternative...
[ Laughter ]
...and it's no yolk.
[joke]
No yolk.
[ Laughter ]
Say goodbye to smelly vinegar
and messy dyes.
The Eggmazing Egg Decorator
is the new, fun,
no?mess solution
to decorate Easter eggs.
We brought along our egg?sperts
and my kiddos.
[ Laughter ]
They're gonna show you
how it works.
Just place
a hard?boiled egg in the opening
and turn on
your Eggmazing.
Grab a colorful marker,
and let's let the fun begin.
You just place
the tip of the marker
to the spinning egg and start
making your own designs.
Cuban: Oh, cool.
Corcoran:
It's clever.
Houdashell:
It's simple, creative...
Herjavec: Yeah!
...and it really is all the fun
without the mess.
Herjavec: Wow.
Great.
McGill: So, Sharks,
who wants to join us
McGill:
Bye, Pickle.
Hop on out of here.
Cuban: Bye.
Good job, guys.
Love you.
Greiner: Bye.
Bye, Sport.
Thanks.
So, tell us how
you dreamt this up.
It was Easter 2015,
decorating in the kitchen,
making a mess with all
the vinegar and all the dyes.
That's when I knew
there had to be a better way.
And I rounded up
a hot glue stick,
an electric screwdriver,
and a spoon.
I'm having a hard time
with the talking rabbit.
I got to tell you.
Houdashell: And I heated
a hot glue stick
and stuck it
to the top of the egg,
and stuck the other end
of that hot glue stick
in the
electric screwdriver
and just balanced it
on the spoon.
And I had Curtis,
my bestie here,
go round up
some markers.
And I pulled the trigger on it
and it started spinning,
touched a marker
to it,
and that's when I knew
I had a better mousetrap.
The problem with this is,
it's very seasonal.
I'm gonna think about this
once a year
when I'm thinking about
coloring eggs,
and then I'm gonna forget
about it for the rest of time.
How are we gonna make any money
selling this only once a year?
Well, we, uh ?? we asked ourself
that same question.
I hope so.
The first of this last year,
we went down the journey,
two years
of development,
and we got a container of them
made in China,
delivered to
his insurance office.
Mine.
We unloaded
all 10,000 of them ourself.
We didn't have anything sold
on March 1st,
and looked at each other
and said,
"That's a lot of eggs."
[ Chuckles ]
A whole lot of eggs.
We proceeded to sell them.
It took us 23 days.
How'd you do it?
We joined ASTRA,
which is a small American
toy?retailer association.
Sent out an e?mail blast.
They began to pick it up.
People that had ordered
two cases
called back and ordered four.
They ordered eight.
Good for you.
Congratulations.
They called back
and ordered 12.
What are your sales?
It was $150,000.
How much do you sell it for,
and what are your costs?
Back then,
it was $8.28.
Herjavec:
Your costs?
So you basically ??
you made no money?
No, they made
about 50 grand.
We did all right.
Wait, wait, wait, he didn't say
what he sold it for.
What does one sell for?
It costs you $8.28.
The first run,
we sold for $19.99.
We are now $24.99.
You saw that it was
really successful at $19,
sold them all out, but
now you're taking a risk
by upping the price.
It was actually ??
Well, it was actually
higher than that.
A lot of the retailers
sold them for more,
but on Amazon, the average
retail price was $59.
O'Leary: Oh!
What?!
Corcoran:
You got to be kidding.
Sorry, people were buying it
from you and upselling it?
People paid $59
for it?
One went on eBay
for $120.
Yeah!
That's awesome!
Greiner:
Wait, wait, wait.
They began to go up
as the demand went up.
Did people give you preorders
for the next Easter ??
the guys who couldn't get
their hands on it?
Right now, we have $1.2 million
in purchase orders.
[ Cuban laughs ]
What?!
And that is starting
next spring, your price.
Whoa!
At what price?
At what price?
$4.71, landed.
What do you
wholesale it for?
$12.50, wholesale.
O'Leary: $12.50.
Are these
a one?way order?
In other words,
in the toy industry...
They're a one?way order.
I'm staring to like you.
What do you mean
by "one?way order"?
Meaning they can't return it.
They can't return it.
So, understand
that those P. O. s,
only half of those
are for the Egg.
Wait, say that again.
Only half ??
Yeah,
can you repeat that?
Herjavec: I'm sorry, Curtis.
What else would they be for?
Our sister product.
Oh, you haven't told us
about another product.
Another product?
Oh, it's ??
Houdashell: Our sister product
is the
TreeMendous Ornament Decorator.
We love puns.
The TreeMendous
Ornament Decorator
is a sister product
to the Egg.
That we have no proof
of concept, in terms of sales.
We have $680,000
worth of sales.
How did you do ??
Is that a one?way sale?
One?way purchase orders,
absolutely.
Curtis, can I see
a Christmas ornament?
Is this gonna be your first
season with the Christmas?
This is
our first season.
That ?? That just got here
from our manufacturer.
Thank you.
But you don't really know
what the actual sell?through
is going to be on those yet?
This one, we do not have
actual sell?through yet.
Greiner:
To the consumer, right?
Cuban: Right. Right.
What do you charge
for this?
$30.
It comes with eight markers
and three ornaments.
I get
the Easter thing.
It's very intuitive
to understand what you're doing.
You're decorating an egg,
which is a long?term tradition.
There is no tradition
to decorate
your own Christmas ornament.
Let me speak to that.
I think there's a lot of risk
on the ornaments,
and the price is high.
People spend a lot more money
at Christmas
than they do
on Easter.
The issue
with your deal
is the size of the cash
you're asking for.
$350,000 ??
big number, okay?
But I'm a very, very creative
Shark, as you know.
I'm gonna
make you an offer.
I'll give you $50,000
for the equity component
of my deal.
I want 33%
of the company.
[ Laughing ]
I want to be
the third guy,
with the ??
I'll wear the ears.
I'll wear the ears,
okay?
And then the $300,000
is a loan, okay?
I'm willing to do that
at 13%.
13%?! [ Laughs ]
Cuban:
Oh, Lord.
Absolutely.
That's egg?cruciating.
13%?!
You know, I'd like to see
your offer, Robert.
We appreciate that
you've egg?tended an offer.
Of course
you appreciate it.
It's the only offer
you've got.
[ Laughter ]
Look,
I've got three kids,
and the only thing that
I want for them is to not ??
not have to see their parents
eat the crusts
off the peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches
like I had to
when I was a kid.
We've worked our whole lives
to get where we are, so ??
Okay, I'll drop my interest rate
to 11%.
[ Laughs ]
I want to, uh, wholeheartedly
disagree with you,
uh, about
your Christmas idea.
I think your Christmas idea
really is not gonna fly.
I think it's very hard,
looking at that box,
to get the idea of the
spinning wheel in the middle,
which is so easy
to see here.
Be careful.
Okay,
here's what I'm gonna do.
I'll give you the $350,000
for 15%,
but I'll only give half of it
in cash
and half of it
in a credit line.
What is the interest rate
on the debt, Barbara?
Whatever is the cheapest rate
I get from my bank.
Whatever is going,
I'll give it right to you.
I'm not making money
on that.
That's about 5%
on something like this.
And if you need more money
than that, no problem.
As long as you have the orders,
I don't mind funding anything...
Yes, ma'am.
...especially when
they can't return them.
We appreciate
the offer.
O'Leary: Okay, so,
I'm willing to be flexible,
but I want
to make some money, too.
I'm ?? I'm ??
I'm with you.
Okay, well, look, I'll do
the, um, $300,000 debt at 7%,
and I'll give you $50,000
for 20% of the company.
[ Laughs ]
Remember,
there's only one Mr. Wonderful.
He's spinning
an egg somewhere.
Listen,
I'm gonna make you an offer.
Curtis and Scott
have two offers on the table
for their Easter?egg
decorating kit, Eggmazing,
but Lori is also interested.
Greiner:
I would give you $100,000,
and I'll ask for 12 1/2%.
The rest
is a line of credit.
What do you charge
on your debt?
I?I will be 7%
as my interest rate.
And by the way,
I came here, in my heart,
uh, needing and ?? and not
wanting to go any higher
than a 10% equity.
I have worked
my whole life
in carpentry
and laying tile.
Uh, my bunny knees
are worn out.
This is my capturing
lightning in a bottle,
and I'm ?? I'm ready
to ride this lightning
the whole way.
You definitely have lightning
in a spinning bottle.
[ Chuckles ]
And the Easter egg thing
is taking off.
But I don't know if I see
an entire company around it.
Good luck.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Houdashell:
We appreciate everyone.
Take mine.
We appreciate...
[ Laughter ]
Cuban:
Congratulations, guys.
Thank you very much.
Thanks very much.
Oh.
Great. Congratulations.
Damn it.
Congratulations, guys.
Thank you all very much.
Herjavec:
Thank you, guys.
Ciao.
Congrats.
Yeah.
You can step on
the bunny ears.
I don't want them.
[ Laughs ]
You good?
Yeah,
I'm good.
[ Chuckles ]
McGill:
It means the world to me.
My best friend just ??
just did what he's been
capable of all his life.
