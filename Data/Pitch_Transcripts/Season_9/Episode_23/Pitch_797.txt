We can really change
the world together.
[ Screams ]
Narrator: ...the ones who
determine their own fate.
?Whoo!
?We got a deal!
Narrator:
We celebrate entrepreneurs.
I want y'all to think ??
Who's next?
Narrator:
This is "Shark Tank."
And tonight,
the American dream continues...
You can call me
the Easter Bunny.
That's egg?cruciating.
[excruciating]
You can ride it
to and from the train station.
"I want to be
the next Scrub Daddy."
Stop the madness.
There's more madness!
Uh?oh.
What are you sales?
20 bucks a month.
20 bucks a month?
Oh!
Big merchants
are going to love this.
That's crazy.
You are going
to get crushed.
in egg?change
for 7% egg?quity in our company.
[ Corcoran laughs ]
Oh.
and help us
change the way
families decorate
their Easter eggs?
It's Eggmazing!
Eggmazing!
[ Laughter ]
Oh, yeah.
Cute kids,
I must say.
I agree.
Give me
a blue set of ears.
Give me the pink.
What's wrong with pink?
No, because I want to be blue.
I'm a boy.
You're better in pink.
Go ahead.
[ Laughs ]
Looks fabulous.
Cuban:
Good job, guys.
I'm gonna change
my offer.
I'll give you
the $350,000
at the lowest interest rate
I can get from my bank.
I, honest to God,
don't know what that is,
but they love me 'cause
I keep a lot of cash there.
I'll give you the credit line
for 10% of the business.
Okay.
Guys,
I'm changing my offer.
$350,000 at 10% equity
and a $2 royalty
until I get paid back.
But I'm gonna give $1...
Did I hear "royalty"?
...to any charity
of your choice ??
some type
of children's organization.
Name me as the charity.
I've got kids.
[ Laughter ]
So do I.
Greiner:
And then that way,
something good
is going to helping kids,
and I'm getting the guarantee,
'cause it is seasonal.
Rich.
You can't give up $2
from every unit.
That's crazy.
That's ?? That is
a little difficult.
You only make
$7.50 a unit.
I actually think
my offer's better.
Guys, I think she'll do
a better job for this,
'cause she's
more product?driven
for ?? for these
kinds of things, right?
So, this isn't
a business for me.
I'm out.
Are you guys actors perchance?
Right, we are ??
I am an actor.
I'm also
a parent coach.
And I'm a voiceover artist
and I'm a hairdresser.
Oh, okay.
So I would be
in my hair salon.
All my clients
buy Amazing Tape.
I ??
I answer the phone,
I'm doing hair,
and I say, "Excuse me."
[ Chuckles ]
"Hugo's Amazing Tape.
Can I help you?"
[ Southern accent ]
"This is Nell.
I'd like one roll
of 2?inch tape."
[ Laughter ]
[ Normal voice ] "I'll be
right back, I'll be right back.
Yeah, can I just get your ??
and your credit card?"
And we're lucky.
And here it goes.
That's how it goes.
I?I get it, I get it.
It ??
It's very crazy chicken, okay?
I thought it was
the best bad theater
we've ever had
on "Shark Tank."
And we've had
a lot of bad theater.
But this
was good bad theater, and...
Okay.
...that was fun, but this is
not really a business.
Well...
[ Corcoran chuckles ]
I'm out.
Hi.
My name is Tony Chan.
I'm from
Los Angeles, California.
My company is Coolpeds USA.
Today I'm asking $250,000
for 5% of our company.
Wow.
I design and make
the world's coolest
and lightest electric vehicles,
like this ??
the world's first
super lightweight
electric briefcase?scooter.
You can ride it to
and from train station...
[ Cuban chuckles ]
...from the office
to the parking lot,
to classes on a huge campus,
and even to the boarding gate
at the airport,
all without
carrying a heavy backpack,
and having so much fun.
Yeah.
[ Cuban chuckles ]
[ Light laughter ]
The bag is easily removable.
And you can go from
a leisurely 7 miles per hour
up to 15 miles per hour.
Wow.
And with regenerative braking,
when you press the handle brake,
right here, it will actually
recharge the battery.
Yeah.
Speak of the battery,
it is also very easily removable
so you can charge it
almost anywhere.
And you can even charge
your phone.
The scooter itself is
really easy to fold like this.
And weighing just 11 pounds,
it is the lightest
electric scooters on the planet.
My mission is to provide fun,
reliable, and affordable
green transportation
to everyone around the globe.
So, who's ready to get moving?
Anyone would like
to give it a ride?
O'Leary:
I want to try it, Tony.
Ah, I want to try it, too,
after Kevin.
O'Leary: Very cool.
Chan: Thank you.
That's interesting.
Awesome.
[ Laughter ]
Yeah.
Herjavec: He's gonna hit
the camera.
It doesn't tip that much.
Whoa, oh.
He's good.
[ Laughs ]
That's really good.
Close the doors!
Herjavec:
Close the doors!
[ Laughter ]
Close the door!
Awesome.
He's awesome.
[ Chuckles ]
Nice. One?handed.
Pretty fast.
I'm impressed.
Yeah, 'cause he ??
Yeah, you ??
Is that
the fast mode?
It's really easy to control,
just with this trigger.
Very cool.
The more you press, the faster.
It's like a motorcycle.
Greiner: How did it feel?
Very cool.
Easy.
Tony?
Chan: Yes?
What's under
the gray sheet?
[ Greiner chuckles ]
Great ?? Great question.
Uh, this is the future.
Let me introduce to you
the future
of the automobile industry.
Oh,
that's beautiful.
The Ampere.
Greiner:
Oh, my God.
Wow.
World's first ??
first fully electric
highway?ready sports car
for under $10,000 retail.
Yeah.
Oh, wow.
We're gonna change the
auto industry to the Model "T."
Greiner:
Wait a minute.
Yeah.
We'll make it simple.
What are you selling ??
that or that?
Both.
Both?
This is our next product.
This is our prototype.
It's a running prototype.
I've been driving ??
Whoo?hoo!
Whoa!
You're a racer.
I know you love cars...
Really.
...but I can't even
get in that quick.
It's cool.
That was
so unexpected.
Yeah.
O'Leary: So, let's take
one product at a time.
This scooter ?? tell me what
you're gonna sell this year.
Sure.
In the past about 18 months,
we've sold about $500,000 worth
of scooter.
And where are you selling
most of those at?
Mostly online.
Is that the only
piece of luggage that
you could put on that?
Can I use my own,
individual luggage?
Actually,
um, we have different styles.
We would like
to provide our own luggage,
just for safety reasoning.
It has to be really rigid.
Did you tell us the price
on that scooter?
Oh, sorry.
$399.
$399? Thank you.
O'Leary: And what does it
cost you, landed, here?
Chan: About $170.
Oh.
There's not enough margin
for distribution.
Right, so, that's why we ??
we just want to go online,
'cause this is great for online.
Did you ??
Did you file a patent on this?
Yeah, I have a patent ??
material patent.
O'Leary: So, Tony,
let's take some airports
where a lot of walking occurs.
Are ?? Are they going to allow
an electric vehicle?
Chan:
I do it all the time.
I've never been stopped,
actually.
Actually, from my experience
and a lot
of my customers' experience,
they ride slowly.
Just don't hit anybody
or do crazy stunts, you know?
[ Laughs ]
Herjavec:
What's your background?
Are you an engineer?
I love cars.
Cars are in my blood.
Me, too.
When I was 7 ??
I know, exactly ??
I started waxing cars
for my neighbors
to make pocket money
when I was 7 ?? 7 years old.
And then,
fast?forward to college at UCLA,
I started to buy classic cars
and repair them
and then resold them
to make profit
for almost four years
of my tuition
and almost all my expenses.
And then I raced cars
and built racecars on the side
for over 15 years.
So I built up a lot
of relationship resource.
Robert, you can go ahead
and make your offer right now.
[ Laughter ]
This is gonna revolutionize
the electric?car industry,
which is booming.
A lot of countries, like France,
the U. K., even China,
they will require all cars
to be sold to be all electric
as early as 2025.
But you're not ?? you're not
selling the electric car yet.
Right, we're gonna start
taking pre?orders this year.
I'm just curious, what does
that car cost somebody?
This one,
we're gonna retail at $9,900.
On this first model,
we would like to make it
a really extravagant racecar.
We follow the Tesla model.
It started with the Roadster
in a small batch and then built,
because it's a cool image.
Now, they want to be cool.
Cuban: Tony,
this is a brutally,
brutally competitive market,
right?
The three hardest businesses
in the world
are, one,
the music business,
two, anything involving
Kevin O'Leary...
[ Laughter ]
...and three,
selling cool.
No, I've ??
Tony, you know, I ??
You have a car guy here
in Herjavec.
I'm out.
[ Sighs ]
Robert?
Herjavec: Tony,
you're such an impressive guy,
and we share
the car passion.
You started
this incredible business.
You're doing half a million
a year in sales.
I mean,
you're doing it.
I want
to come along.
Yes, i really want you
to come along, seriously.
[ Laughter ]
I?I'm just not sure ??
Owning a car company
is really cool,
and we start selling, yes.
It's ??
It's just a little confusing,
and I mean that
with the most respect.
This ??
The business
you brought out today
really is the scooter business
with a passion business, and ??
Oh, this is
my main business entry.
Corcoran:
Yeah, it shows.
The scooter was, like,
a pre, you know, show.
That really shows,
and that's hard for an investor.
This is my passion.
Tony, I?I ??
O'Leary:
Make a decision, Robert.
I ?? I can't come along
for a ride
on the scooter
and the car.
Well ??
It's got to be one.
You got to focus.
The car is the major,
for sure.
I'm out.
I'm sorry.
Cuban:
Congrats, Tony.
You've come
a long way, buddy.
Thank you very much.
You should be
very proud.
Thank you.
Leave the scooter.
Greiner:
You'll keep going far.
[ Chuckles ]
Thank you.
I'm seeking $250,000
in exchange for a 7 1/2 stake ??
a 7 1/2% stake of my company.
Sharks, we've all been here.
You're paying
for your iced latte
at the local coffee joint ??
hey, there ??
and your morning is off
to a great start...
[ Chuckles ]
...until this moment.
Getting back loose change.
Oh! I hate loose change.
Me, too.
It's filthy,
it doesn't fit in your wallet
or your skinny jeans.
Getting coins back from cash
is a completely inefficient,
annoying, and stupid way...
That's right.
...to transact.
Instead, turn your loose change
into easy money with CoinOut,
the most convenient way
to digitize your loose change.
We're getting rid
of those pesky pennies,
allowing people to take
full control over their money.
Let me show you how it works.
So, you're paying with cash
at a participating merchant,
and your change is $1.34.
After handing over the cash,
you simply ask the cashier,
"I'd like to CoinOut."
When she turns a device, you
simply enter your phone number
into the device at checkout,
and you can choose if you want
to CoinOut just the coins ??
the 34 cents ??
or the full change ??
the $1.34 ??
to your CoinOut wallet.
Hit "Confirm" and ?? boom ??
transaction's complete.
You'll get a text message
confirming the transaction,
along with instructions to set
up your account online later.
And the best part is,
there's no app to download,
no financial information needed,
and no sign?up required
until you're ready to cash out.
Sharks, carrying around coins
simply doesn't make sense.
So the next time you check out,
CoinOut.
Greiner: Interesting.
O'Leary: Can I pay
with my CoinOut account
next time
I go to get a coffee?
That's one of the options.
So, we have four cash?out
options right now for customers.
You can transfer it
to your bank account,
you can turn it into
an Amazon gift card,
you can donate to charity,
or, the last option,
is redeeming it in store.
Wow. Why ?? Why is it good
for retail?
We build the connective tissue
between the merchant
and the cash customer
that's previously anonymous.
I think
it's a great idea.
I hate
carrying change.
That's because
you're rich.
[ Laughter ]
Walk me through
how you make money at it.
What's the revenue model?
Well, the business model,
we charge merchants
20 bucks a month,
and then we are also earning ??
20 bucks a month?
20 bucks a month.
We also earn 3%
on each transaction.
Oh!
So, let me tell you
my experience, all right?
And this actually goes back
to "Shark Tank."
I was in law school.
I was on the path
to become a corporate lawyer.
And I watched
the Scrub Daddy episode.
Whoo?hoo!
[ Chuckles ]
I have my property textbook
next to me.
And I'm looking at this guy,
and this guy is just teeming
with emotion and energy.
And I'm like, "Wow.
This guy, like, he really cares
about what he's invested in."
And I said, "I want to be
the next Scrub Daddy."
I really did.
And this has been a long,
drawn?out process.
I studied the market.
But ??
Okay, hold on. I had
a full?time offer at Apple.
[ Chuckles ]
Turned it down.
Full?time clear path to
corporate law, turned it down.
I've got a ton invested in this.
I'm relentless.
How much
do you have ??
How much do you have
invested in it?
We raised $460,000 ?? family,
friends, some of my own money.
However,
change is a big problem.
No one's solved it,
and to redistribute ??
Okay, let me just tell you
how I solved it.
Here's my credit card.
Okay, fine, fine, okay,
but, however,
the numbers
tell a different story, Mark.
32% of all U. S. transactions
are still done in cash.
Herjavec: Absolutely.
32%?
30?? That's more than credit,
more than debit.
It's in the merchants' interest
to do more
of these transactions.
Data is king in this world.
If you go
to any major coffee chain,
only 15%
are on their loyalty program.
They're not accessing
any of these customers
that are paying with cash,
'cause they don't want
to download an app.
Big merchants
are going to love this.
I got to give this kid
a compliment.
I don't think
I've ever seen anybody
go one?on?one
with the Sharks.
You know,
you basically dismissed Kevin.
He got reprimanded
by you.
You treat Mark as though he's
your equal here. Good for you.
No, it was ??
it was fine.
I've never seen a kid come
in here ?? Good for you.
is for people
who don't like change.
Which is everyone.
The loyalty and the other stuff
is a benefit.
for his platform for eliminating
loose change, CoinOut,
but he doesn't like
the contingency
she placed on the offer,
even though it's based on
the numbers he projected.
