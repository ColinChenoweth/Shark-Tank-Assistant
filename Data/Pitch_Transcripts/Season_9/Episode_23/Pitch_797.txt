My company is Coolpeds USA.
Today I'm asking $250,000
for 5% of our company.
O'Leary:

Ah, I want to try it, too,

O'Leary: Very cool.
Chan: Thank you.
That's interesting.
Awesome.

It doesn't tip that much.

[ Greiner chuckles ]
Great ?? Great question.
Uh, this is the future.
Let me introduce to you
the future
of the automobile industry.
Oh,
that's beautiful.
The Ampere.
Greiner:
Oh, my God.
Wow.
World's first ??
first fully electric
highway?ready sports car
for under $10,000 retail.
Yeah.
Oh, wow.
We're gonna change the
auto industry to the Model "T."
Greiner:
Wait a minute.
Yeah.
We'll make it simple.
What are you selling ??
that or that?
Both.
Both?
This is our next product.
This is our prototype.
It's a running prototype.
I've been driving ??
Whoo?hoo!
Whoa!
You're a racer.
I know you love cars...
Really.
...but I can't even
get in that quick.
It's cool.
That was
so unexpected.
Yeah.
O'Leary: So, let's take
one product at a time.
This scooter ?? tell me what
you're gonna sell this year.
Sure.
In the past about 18 months,
we've sold about $500,000 worth
of scooter.
Chan: About $170.
Oh.
There's not enough margin
for distribution.
Right, so, that's why we ??
we just want to go online,
'cause this is great for online.
Did you ??
Did you file a patent on this?
Yeah, I have a patent ??
material patent.
O'Leary: So, Tony,
let's take some airports
where a lot of walking occurs.
Are ?? Are they going to allow
an electric vehicle?
Chan:
I do it all the time.
I've never been stopped,
actually.
Actually, from my experience
Cuban: Tony,
this is a brutally,
brutally competitive market,
right?
The three hardest businesses
in the world
are, one,
the music business,
two, anything involving
Kevin O'Leary...
[ Laughter ]
No, I've ??
Tony, you know, I ??
You have a car guy here
in Herjavec.
I'm out.
[ Sighs ]
Robert?
Herjavec: Tony,
you're such an impressive guy,
This is my passion.
Tony, I?I ??
O'Leary:
Make a decision, Robert.
I ?? I can't come along
for a ride
Cuban:
Congrats, Tony.
You've come
a long way, buddy.
Thank you very much.
You should be
very proud.
Thank you.
Leave the scooter.
Greiner:
You'll keep going far.
[ Chuckles ]
Thank you.
I'm seeking $250,000
in exchange for a 7 1/2 stake ??
a 7 1/2% stake of my company.
Sharks, we've all been here.
You're paying
for your iced latte
at the local coffee joint ??
hey, there ??
Getting back loose change.
Oh! I hate loose change.
Me, too.
It's filthy,
it doesn't fit in your wallet
or your skinny jeans.
Getting coins back from cash
is a completely inefficient,
Instead, turn your loose change
into easy money with CoinOut,
the most convenient way
to digitize your loose change.
We're getting rid
of those pesky pennies,
allowing people to take
full control over their money.
Let me show you how it works.
So, you're paying with cash
at a participating merchant,
and your change is $1.34.
the 34 cents ??
or the full change ??
the $1.34 ??
to your CoinOut wallet.
We build the connective tissue
between the merchant
I hate
carrying change.
That's because
you're rich.
[ Laughter ]
Walk me through
how you make money at it.
What's the revenue model?
Well, the business model,
we charge merchants
20 bucks a month,
However,
change is a big problem.
It's in the merchants' interest
to do more
of these transactions.
Data is king in this world.
If you go
to any major coffee chain,
only 15%
are on their loyalty program.
They're not accessing
any of these customers
that are paying with cash,
'cause they don't want
to download an app.
Big merchants
are going to love this.
I got to give this kid
a compliment.
I don't think
I've ever seen anybody
go one?on?one
with the Sharks.
You know,
you basically dismissed Kevin.
is for people
who don't like change.
for his platform for eliminating
loose change, CoinOut,
but he doesn't like
the contingency
she placed on the offer,
even though it's based on
the numbers he projected.
