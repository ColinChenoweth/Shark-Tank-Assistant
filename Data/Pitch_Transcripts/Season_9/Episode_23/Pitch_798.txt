My name is Jeff Witten.
I'm from Mamaroneck, New York,
and my company is CoinOut.
Jeff, why are you not
gonna get crushed like
a cockroach in this?
How can you possibly beat
the giant payment operators
long?term?
So, I'll tell you why.
O'Leary: Please.
Num?? First of all,
cash is not new.
That's your answer?
No one has done this.
The reason why no one's
done this is because, look,
everyone in the industry
thinks cash is going away,
but it's not.
Nobody thinks cash
is going away.
All the ??
Even the bitcoin freaks
don't think cash is going away.
I?I ?? Mark,
with all due respect ??
You are going
to get crushed.
Mr. Wonderful,
with all due respect,
we're not gonna get crushed.
The technology we've built,
it's ??
of course, it can be replicated,
but it's difficult to build.
Okay?
[ Chuckles ]
You also ??
You need a banking relationship
and you need
a regulatory structure in place
that's not straightforward.
I feel like
I'm at a funeral!
Why would that retailer
have that screen there?
Right.
What's in it
for them?
First of all, cash is
very expensive for the retailer.
So, think about,
from getting delivery ??
armored?truck delivery
of all the coins.
This happens
at my local pizzeria?
They get an armored?truck
delivery for their coins?
It's ?? It's crazy.
It's so expensive.
The cost is number one.
Number two is this is
an effective loyalty program
for the retailer.
Loyal ?? So, number two ??
Jeff, I just want to know
if the barista is ??
Oh, my God.
Cuban: Let him get ??
Kevin, him her talk.
Witten: So, there's ??
Number two ??
The barista is looking
at fear at you...
Corcoran:
Let him talk.
...because she knows
a dead man walking.
Witten: Kevin, with all
due respect, let me finish.
Yes.
So, the number two,
the loyalty program,
is key for these guys, okay?
Okay, so, Jeff,
here's what I'm hearing.
People want to use
alternative payment systems
to simplify
their lives, right?
The issue for you
is getting people
to use your application.
Agreed.
That's not cheap.
And you're trying
to get 20 bucks a month
out of all the applications that
that barista could possibly run.
But ?? Okay, fair ??
fair points.
Herjavec: Jeff, you come
out here, we told you ??
All of that doesn't matter
if you just get a deal.
We told you ??
You've won my respect.
We told you
everything that's wrong with it.
Yeah, you keep coming back.
Tell us what's working.
Four months ?? okay? ??
we've done 2,500 transactions.
The customers that use it
love it and are coming back.
The problem
you're really solving
Witten: Yeah.
But that's
the fundamental problem, right?
Yes, for sure.
The part where you
put in the phone number...
Yes.
...and stored it,
and then you use that
in the cloud
to accumulate everything,
right?
Yes.
Clever.
The best part of everything
you've told me is that ??
the idea
that for any loyalty program,
the barista just says,
"Put in your phone number.
If and when
you decide to join,
you're gonna have accumulated
all these benefits,
and we'll track."
Yeah.
That's brilliant.
The fact that you're focused on
CoinOut is horrific.
Jeff has an offer from Barbara
Witten:
With all due respect,
the contingency there
is untenable.
Cuban: Oh!
Why not?
Untenable?
But you said
you would get it.
I?I'm not gonna do a contingency
based on locations.
Whoa.
But you said
you could get the locations.
I don't get that.
And I believe I can,
but it's not in my interest.
But you don't believe it enough
to make the deal dependent ??
No, no, no,
that's doesn't mean that.
A lawyer.
I'm very confident
in this business.
If you ?? If you don't see ??
But I'm losing the confidence
when you say that.
This is a long?? This is a ??
This is a long?term vision.
If it's gonna be contingent
on getting a number
within six months,
then I don't think
you fully believe in the vision.
You don't.
No, no, I do.
I believed in you until you said
you didn't believe.
Mr. Wonderful, you would never
make that sort of a deal.
But if it was the only offer
I had, I might consider it.
Corcoran: You said no.
O'Leary: You don't have
the confidence to get there
that you suggested earlier.
Gosh,
I love Jeff.
I do have the confidence.
When I borrowed money
for my business,
I guaranteed that I'd
pay them back within six months.
But ?? But ??
And I would have never taken
the original $1,000
unless I felt
entirely sure
I would find some way
to get that money back
to that investor.
Fair enough, fair enough,
of course.
Jeff, fair enough,
but I'm out, yeah.
Okay.
Okay, Jeff,
I'm gonna make you an offer.
You wouldn't take
a contingency deal at 15%.
How much pain
are you willing to take?
Oh!
Witten: So, I?I don't need
to know if I should be ??
Jeff, it's not about love,
it's about money.
Yeah, but ?? but you need to be
my partner in this, so ??
Look ??
There's been nothing
that you've said today
to convey that you're at all
interested in the business.
Herjavec: Jeff,
when I started my business,
my bank said,
"Every quarter,
you have to hit
a certain level of sales
for us to continue
to give you the money."
Of course.
If I didn't hit them,
they wanted their money back.
Of course.
Maybe the 700 locations
is too much of a stretch.
Okay.
But you've got
to prove it out.
Sure.
So I'll give you the $250,000,
15% equity,
but I want to see
a successful pilot
with a
large?scale retailer.
Appreciate your offer.
Thank you very much.
I think it's a fair contingency.
How about, would ??
would you come down to, um ??
[Scoffs] ?? I would do 10%.
And look, I think ??
$250,000, 15%.
Your other offer
is $250,000 for 25% from Kevin.
Agreed, but, look,
I think we've proven
that ?? that the technology
is pretty cool.
This is a huge idea, a huge
market. I don't think you ??
Jeff, he's not gonna move.
You got to make a decision.
Hold on. Can I finish?
O'Leary:
Not gonna move.
[ Chuckling ]
I?I'm not gonna move.
You're not gonna move at all
at 15%?
That ?? That's ??
You've watched "Shark Tank."
You know he's not moving.
Witten:
I would ?? I would ??
You're in the world
of theory.
So, yeah, my ??
I need to see that world
get into reality.
My maximum, in my head,
was 12 1/2%.
Can you come down
to 12 1/2%?
So, hang ??
hang on a second.
You were willing
to give up 12 1/2%,
but for the other 2 1/2%,
you're not willing
to make that ??
The 12 1/2% was the highest
that I wanted to go.
Jeff, it ??
I'm a simple guy.
Okay, so, let ??
So, fine.
It's 15%.
It ?? It ??
You know what?
Can I just ??
I have one contingency.
All right.
Cuban:
Congratulations, Jeff.
Greiner:
Congratulations, Jeff.
[ Chuckles ]
This is awesome. Thank you.
Good job.
Cuban: Congrats, Jeff.
Good luck.
Greiner:
Congrats, Jeff.
Whew.
I'm pumped.
I'm really pumped
to have Robert onboard.
He's the perfect Shark,
and we're gonna crush it.
"Shark Tank" has been a part
of my story the whole way.
It's part of
the inspiration here.
And with Robert onboard,
we're gonna be Scrub Daddy 2.
