My name is Jeff Witten.
Jeff, why are you not
gonna get crushed like
a cockroach in this?
How can you possibly beat
the giant payment operators
long?term?
So, I'll tell you why.
O'Leary: Please.
Num?? First of all,
cash is not new.
That's your answer?
No one has done this.
The reason why no one's
done this is because, look,
everyone in the industry
thinks cash is going away,
but it's not.
Nobody thinks cash
is going away.
All the ??
Even the bitcoin freaks
don't think cash is going away.
I?I ?? Mark,
with all due respect ??
You are going
to get crushed.
Mr. Wonderful,
with all due respect,
we're not gonna get crushed.
The technology we've built,
it's ??
of course, it can be replicated,
but it's difficult to build.
Okay?
[ Chuckles ]
You also ??
You need a banking relationship
Jeff, I just want to know
if the barista is ??
Oh, my God.
Cuban: Let him get ??
Kevin, him her talk.
Witten: So, there's ??
Number two ??
The barista is looking
at fear at you...
Corcoran:
Let him talk.
...because she knows
a dead man walking.
Witten: Kevin, with all
due respect, let me finish.
Yes.
So, the number two,
the loyalty program,
is key for these guys, okay?
Okay, so, Jeff,
here's what I'm hearing.
People want to use
alternative payment systems
to simplify
their lives, right?
The issue for you
is getting people
to use your application.
Agreed.
That's not cheap.
Herjavec: Jeff, you come
out here, we told you ??
All of that doesn't matter
if you just get a deal.
We told you ??
You've won my respect.
We told you
everything that's wrong with it.
Yeah, you keep coming back.
Tell us what's working.
Four months ?? okay? ??
we've done 2,500 transactions.
Witten: Yeah.
But that's
the fundamental problem, right?
Yes, for sure.
The part where you
put in the phone number...
Jeff has an offer from Barbara
Witten:
With all due respect,
the contingency there
is untenable.
Cuban: Oh!
Why not?
Untenable?
But you said
you would get it.
I?I'm not gonna do a contingency
based on locations.
Whoa.
But you said
you could get the locations.
that you suggested earlier.
Gosh,
I love Jeff.
I do have the confidence.
When I borrowed money
for my business,
I guaranteed that I'd
pay them back within six months.
But ?? But ??
Jeff, fair enough,
but I'm out, yeah.
Okay.
Okay, Jeff,
I'm gonna make you an offer.
You wouldn't take
a contingency deal at 15%.
How much pain
are you willing to take?
Oh!
Witten: So, I?I don't need
to know if I should be ??
Jeff, it's not about love,
it's about money.
Yeah, but ?? but you need to be
my partner in this, so ??
Look ??
There's been nothing
that you've said today
to convey that you're at all
interested in the business.
Herjavec: Jeff,
when I started my business,
my bank said,
"Every quarter,
you have to hit
a certain level of sales
for us to continue
to give you the money."
Of course.
If I didn't hit them,
they wanted their money back.
Of course.
Maybe the 700 locations
is too much of a stretch.
Okay.
But you've got
to prove it out.
Sure.
So I'll give you the $250,000,
15% equity,
but I want to see
a successful pilot
with a
large?scale retailer.
Appreciate your offer.
Thank you very much.
I think it's a fair contingency.
How about, would ??
would you come down to, um ??
[Scoffs] ?? I would do 10%.
Jeff, he's not gonna move.
You got to make a decision.
Hold on. Can I finish?
O'Leary:
Not gonna move.
[ Chuckling ]
I?I'm not gonna move.
You're not gonna move at all
at 15%?
That ?? That's ??
You've watched "Shark Tank."
You know he's not moving.
Witten:
I would ?? I would ??
You're in the world
of theory.
So, yeah, my ??
I need to see that world
get into reality.
My maximum, in my head,
was 12 1/2%.
Can you come down
to 12 1/2%?
So, hang ??
hang on a second.
You were willing
to give up 12 1/2%,
but for the other 2 1/2%,
you're not willing
to make that ??
The 12 1/2% was the highest
that I wanted to go.
Jeff, it ??
I'm a simple guy.
Okay, so, let ??
So, fine.
It's 15%.
It ?? It ??
You know what?
Can I just ??
I have one contingency.
All right.
Cuban:
Congratulations, Jeff.
Greiner:
Congratulations, Jeff.
[ Chuckles ]
This is awesome. Thank you.
Good job.
Cuban: Congrats, Jeff.
Good luck.
Greiner:
Congrats, Jeff.
Whew.
I'm pumped.
I'm really pumped
to have Robert onboard.
