How are you?
My name is Uki Deane.
I am from the beautiful city
of Buenos Aires, Argentina,
and I am seeking
a $200,000 investment
in exchange for a 20% stake
in my company.
Sharks, two years ago,
I was sitting
in my corporate?finance job just
wishing I could be at the beach.
So, you know what I did?
I looked at my boss
straight into the eyes,
I gathered all the courage
I had, and I said,
"I quit, goodbye, ciao!"
[ Laughter ]
I then put
all of my life savings
into starting a fantastic line
of swimwear
I proudly call...
Bermies.
Bermies are not only
extremely fashionable,
but they're also
very affordable.
So now, thanks to Bermies,
you can chill at the beach
and look good and feel fantastic
while sipping that piña colada.
Sharks, the number?one feedback
I get from all of my customers
is that Bermies ??
the most comfortable swim trunks
they have ever worn.
Because unlike
those other brands,
Bermies made from
premium?quality fabrics,
making them stretchy,
breathable,
but more importantly,
super fast?drying.
So, Sharks, what do you say?
Jump on the Bermies adventure
with me,
and let's sail away
to our next destination.
[ Chuckles ]
Greiner: Good job.
Can we see them?
Can we see them?
I have some samples for you.
I love his accent.
First one's for you.
Thank you.
Cuban:
One for him...
Second one for you.
Greiner:
Thank you.
Cuban:
Thank you, Uki.
Herjavec: Oh, I like
the pink ones, Lori.
You want the pink, Robert?
I'll trade with you.
Oh, I like
the green, too.
Oh, wow.
I chose them specifically
all for you.
Deane: I want you first
to feel that quality, okay?
Herjavec: Feeling.
Feeling that quality.
Bathing suits like that,
you have not seen before.
Greiner:
We haven't?
The quality
is very different.
Herjavec: What ?? What's
different with the material?
The difference is,
most bathing suits
are made out of 100% polyester,
and the reason for that is
because it's a cheap material.
It dries fast,
people are used to it,
and they think
that men just buy.
They're not like women,
which go and touch and feel.
But, Uki, those are only
the cheap ones.
The more
expensive ones...
The more expensive ones ??
for example, Vilebrequin...
Frankel:
Vilebrequin, yeah.
All right, Vilebrequin sells
between $200, $300.
Oh, wow.
What do these
sell for?
These sell for $40.99 retail.
I'm at that 50% benchmark,
right below them,
so you can get people
who have disposable income
and can buy them.
These types of swim trunks
you won't find at this price
point anywhere in the market.
How much does it cost
to have them made?
Approximately $9.80.
That's great.
Yeah.
They should be
about $6.50, though.
It can be, 100%, at $6.50.
These type of swim trunks you
won't find at this price point
anywhere in the market ??
a bathing suit which has cool,
funky patterns like this
and also offers that quality,
you won't find for $40.99.
Uki, Uki, a turtle is not
cool or funky, right?
Greiner:
And you said ??
They're always
on swimsuits.
John: Uki, I've been doing this
for 25 years.
Yes, sir.
[ Chuckles ]
This stuff
is everywhere.
I ??
I promise you
at the same price...
Yes.
...'cause I made it.
Okay.
No problem.
When I started FUBU,
I didn't put three sleeves
on a shirt.
Shirts have been
existing everywhere, too.
Doesn't mean that
this is not a great business.
What you're doing,
it is good.
Very good quality.
So now, let's get into
the business stuff.
The reason you want to buy
these bathing suits
and invest in me...
Yeah.
...is because of this guy.
There you go.
Frankel: Yes!
Deane: This is the guy
which takes you to the top.
How old are you?
Do you mind if I ask?
I'm 27 years old.
27 years old.
Good for you.
All right.
Do you have any sales?
Okay.
The first official year is 2016.
Okay.                      Okay.
In 2016,
I made $271,000 in sales.
Good for you.
Greiner: Wow.
Okay.
And those stores are online
or combination?
Deane: Okay, so,
I've done trade shows.
I started off
taking pictures of Bermuda.
I do everything.
I'm a one?man show.
I started doing the pictures,
I do the marketing,
I designed
all of these bathing suits.
I do absolutely everything,
okay? I'm a hustler.
Um, and when I started...
I love him.
...taking pictures of friends...
I love you.
...in Bermuda ??
I love you.
If you had a 3 in front
of your age, we'd be married.
[ Laughter ]
So when I started taking
pictures of people in Bermuda,
started talking
to their friends...
Man:
Just start swimming?
...and I started building up
Instagram.
I don't even know
what you're talking about!
[ Laughing ]
He's just talking.
It's amazing.
I'm sorry.
Keep on going.
I'll follow you, Uki.
Then I said,
"Hm, how do I get more people?"
So I said Kickstarter.
I did a Kickstarter...
Ahh.
...I asked for $10,000,
I got $30,000. Okay.
On these?
That was in 2016?
Do you own ??
This was 2016.
Okay.
What were your sales
so far this year?
This year, as of September,
I am at $300,000 in sales.
Good for you.
Good.
Greiner: Wow.
Deane: And I'm estimating
an increase of 20%.
Do you
own the company alone?
Uki Deane, 100%.
Okay.
[ Laughter ]
And where
did you get the money?
Okay, so,
the money is ??
I basically put in $100,000
into the business.
You did,
of your own money.
Cuban:
You started off ??
Okay, I?I will get there.
[ Laughter ]
So, I started ??
I started ??
It wasn't
your own money.
It is, it is!
Listen, listen, listen.
Herjavec: Lori,
we're gonna get there!
Give him some time.
One second.
I started off with $25,000
of my own money,
then I started having
cash?flow issues
because I was doing trade shows.
I asked my family,
they gave me $25,000 more.
Then I started having
more orders,
and this is just droving me ??
driving me crazy, and I said...
Why was that
driving you crazy?
Cuban: Because he doesn't have
the cash to make them.
Because I have no money to put
into manufacturing orders...
Oh, to manufacture, got it,
got it, got it, got it.
...and they want to pay
once they get the delivery...
I have been there.
So, I said I had to find a way,
and my grandparents
had given me some stocks.
And I said,
"Whatever, I'll sell it."
I sold those stocks
and I got $50,000 more
and here I am
seeking more money.
Wow.
So how big
is your online presence?
Wholesale, 2 retailers
is about 80% of my business.
The online is only 20%.
We have a product
called Sand Cloud.
It's three guys
from San Diego...
I've cooperated
with sometimes.
...and they ran into
cash?flow problems, right?
Yep.
So they couldn't
build inventory,
they couldn't do wholesale
like you,
so they use Instagram.
Correct.
People take their picture,
and they're killing it.
Exactly what I'm ??
$7 million this year.
I have people tagging me...
But that's only
20% of your business.
That is correct.
Okay.
And that is what I want to grow,
because how do you grow
that much?
You got to push marketing.
How many
social networking followers?
Yeah, how many?
How many, Uki?
Right now, 25,000.
Frankel: Okay.
It's okay.
That's not bad.
No, it's okay.
It's not huge.
It's not huge.
Is that you?
So, here's the story
on this.
I said,
"What's the cheapest place
I can go to try and get
more pictures?"
So I jumped on a plane,
I flew to southeast Asia,
I walked and approached
random people at the beach
and I said, "Hello."
Okay,
hold on.
But that's not Bermuda.
Cheapest, closest place
is southeast Asia?
No, cheap ??
in terms of cheapness
and, like, finding people
who are vacationing
and are willing
to take their pictures, 100%.
It says "Bermies."
There's no way that
the cheapest way to get a guy ??
a picture of a guy with
a man bun and a soccer ball...
[ Laughter ]
...is to go
to southeast Asia,
which brings up
the question
of whether or not you're able
to manage cash.
Deane:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
His point is just you
could've gone to Venice Beach.
You could've gone
to South Beach.
Good point.
I'm...
Like, you could've gone
anywhere a little bit closer,
a little
less expensive.
Photographers cost
about $5,000, okay?
You have to then
hire the models. Yes ??
No!
All these Inst??
All these millennials.
Don't you have a phone
with a camera?
I could've done it in Miami,
but I wanted
to build a lifestyle.
I wanted to build
the concept of my brand.
Frankel: But you need
to build up.
I wanted to show ??
You're not ?? You can't make
a brand out of a lifestyle.
If I have a beach ??
in Venice Beach ??
You cannot run around
taking pictures
and, you know,
wearing shorts and that's ??
No,
let me finish.
I was you.
I had a healthy
baked?goods company
called Bethenny Bakes ??
wheat?, egg?, and dairy?free ??
and I was taking money
and spending it as I went.
It was like walking into a mall
without a plan
and just being, like,
"Oh, I like that, I like that,"
and then coming home and
being like, "Wait, I have
nothing to show for this."
So here you are.
You're a little manic,
which I get, 'cause I am, too.
I was you.
You're all over
the place.
If you're
getting money here,
you have to have a plan
for the money,
not, "I'm going here,
I'm going there, I'm doing this,
I'm doing that,
the Bermuda shorts"...
It's a lifestyle.
...but they're not ??
You can't just say words
like "lifestyle,"
which everybody says
"lifestyle brand,"
and it means nothing.
You have to create a brand
with a plan.
What's the plan
right now?
What comes next?
but they want to hear
a solid business plan from Uki
on how he's going to grow
his men's swim?short company,
Bermies.
Everybody says
"lifestyle brand,"
and it means nothing.
You have to create a brand
with a plan.
What's the plan
right now?
Cuban:
What comes next?
The plan right now
is to build a team, okay?
I need to build a team to be
able to get to the next stage.
I can't handle everything
right now.
Cuban: Uki, I think the future
of selling swimwear
and products like this
is online.
And that's where I'm going.
Cuban:
But that's not where you're at,
so for those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you.
Man: You remind me, honestly,
of a young Robert.
You do.
Um, but you're everywhere,
right, and that's what ??
Herjavec: You mean
because of the body?
[ Greiner laughs ]
John:
The enthusiasm.
A lot of energy,
but I wish you luck. I'm out.
Thank you.
Uki, listen,
your energy is fabulous.
Thank you.
Your passion
is fabulous,
and I know
that it'll go far for you.
You could probably
sell mud,
and that's what
they said about me.
The problem for me
about this is,
is I think you're in
a super crowded space.
Uki, I...
Yeah.
I...
I love the energy...
[ Laughter ]
...I love the passion.
I'm so tired of him.
And I love the fun.
But at
a certain point...
Yeah.
...I kind of
want to put the fun aside
and I want to talk about
real business stuff.
And through
your entire presentation,
I was waiting
for that.
You're all over the map,
my friend.
I cannot follow
the bouncing ball.
I was hoping it was gonna land
in an online strategy...
But that's ??
...where you're sending
to millennials
and people
are tagging you...
But that is ??
...and they're
your biggest sales force.
I'm already doing that,
and I don't have the funds to
invest into marketing right now,
which is why I'm searching
part of the money to do that.
That's what you're ??
Frankel: That will end up
down the toilet
if you don't have
your whole business lined up.
Yeah, th??
you're missing the point.
Your cost of marketing
in that area is the lowest part.
You could've built a brand
around that.
I could see so many connections
with my other products
that are in the same industry,
but you scare me.
You're ?? You're too much fun
and you're too scattered.
I'm sorry.
I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you for the honesty.
So, there's two
different lengths ??
Everybody has two lengths!
They don't.
They really don't.
What are you ??
They really don't.
What are you
talking about?
[ Indistinct shouting ]
Uki, why are you
arguing with him
when you have
one Sharkette left?
You should be asking her
what she wants to know
in case
she might want to invest.
I'm sorry. Bethenny,
is there anything else
you would like to know?
[ Laughs ]
No.
The ?? The thing is ??
The thing is...
[ Greiner laughs ]
...that
I don't know how ??
you guys
were probably all geniuses
when you were young and ?? and
were very successful young.
No.
I didn't ??
I was not successful
until I was 37 years old.
I was ?? I was broke,
living in a studio apartment,
and I had
all these ideas.
I was always the one hustling
with the ideas.
And you're not
supposed to know everything,
and you are
supposed to be scattered
because you're
27 years old.
And the one thing
I will say
is I created a cocktail
that was very basic,
but it was
a problem?solver.
Some of the best ideas
are the simplest.
You're very complicated.
This is like
other things.
It's very manic
and ADD
and you are going to
hit it out of the park
and you're going to
show all of us,
but for now,
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you very much, guys,
for your time.
Cuban:
Congrats, Uki.
Good luck, Uki.
But, gentlemen, seriously,
when you try them on
and you see
how comfortable they are...
Cuban:
We'll buy 10 more.
Never stop selling.
Yes. Yeah.
Ask the production.
I love that.
Thank you very much,
guys.
Cuban:
Congrats, Uki.
Bye.
He was great.
Good luck.
Deane: I think they made
a very big mistake.
I have given everything I have,
I quit my job,
I put all of my life savings,
and I am committed.
And when somebody is committed
and driven
and has an objective
to reach that goal,
they won't stop.
So try and stop me.
The Sharks clearly didn't.
[ Laughs ]
Narrator:
This season, we welcomed
inspirational new Sharks
to the tank.
That's the type of work
we need from you
in the classroom when your
teachers are talking to you.
What I tell
the next generation is,
"You don't have to hit
home runs.
You can also chase your dreams
through education."
Blakely:
I'm a big believer that the
world would be a better place
if women were elevated
on the planet
and given the chance
to fulfill their dreams.
Frankel: I want women to know
it is the most empowering thing
to make your own money
and execute your own ideas.
Oza:
It's known as the American dream
because people
can start with nothing,
have a great idea, and build it
into something special.
Branson: I think "Shark Tank"
influences a lot of young people
to actually
become entrepreneurs,
and they will become the
Richard Branson of the future
because of watching
"Shark Tank."
Narrator: We saw
astronomical successes.
Krause: We only had about
$100,000 in retail sales,
and now we've broken
$141 million.
Brown:
Within five minutes of airing,
I had sold out
of all of my inventory.
Just three months later,
we just passed the $50 million
in retail sales mark.
Taranto:
Sales were $350,000.
This year, we'll do
over $100 million in sales.
Samtani:
When we pitched on "Shark Tank,"
we did $87,000 in sales.
2 1/2 years later, we're now
at $7 million in sales.
Mills: So much has happened
since making the deal with
Kevin four months ago.
We're now in 81 cities
and 15 states.
Siminoff:
I think Ring is proof
that entrepreneurship is still
alive and well in America.
It's now been four years
since "Shark Tank,"
and the business is now valued
at $1 billion.
Narrator: And we watched
"Shark Tank" businesses
continue to change the world.
Shresta: I think
in times like this,
giving people a form of
portable power gives them hope,
and we're just glad that
our light and our phone chargers
are there to help.
Look at all this.
This is insane.
Herjavec:
We're getting to a point
that there'll be more plastic
in the ocean
than there will be fish,
and that's sad.
But it's also great that we can
help in some small way.
Our families
are loving it.
Cuban:
I'm a Shark, but I'm also a dad.
But now with Brightwheel,
we can impact
the early education of millions
of children across this country.
That's incredible,
and, you know, that's the beauty
of "Shark Tank."
Corcoran: When you're a Shark,
it's great to make money,
but more important,
you can invest in businesses
you actually believe in.
We're not just
making dreams come true,
we're making a difference
in people's lives.
[ Applause ]
