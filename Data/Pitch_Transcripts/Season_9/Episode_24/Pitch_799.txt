How are you?
My name is Uki Deane.
I am from the beautiful city
of Buenos Aires, Argentina,
Cuban:
Thank you, Uki.
Herjavec: Oh, I like
the pink ones, Lori.
You want the pink, Robert?
I'll trade with you.
Oh, I like
the green, too.
Oh, wow.
I chose them specifically
all for you.
Deane: I want you first
to feel that quality, okay?
Herjavec: Feeling.
Feeling that quality.
Bathing suits like that,
you have not seen before.
Greiner:
We haven't?
The quality
is very different.
Herjavec: What ?? What's
different with the material?
The difference is,
most bathing suits
are made out of 100% polyester,
But, Uki, those are only
the cheap ones.
The more
expensive ones...
The more expensive ones ??
for example, Vilebrequin...
Frankel:
Vilebrequin, yeah.
All right, Vilebrequin sells
between $200, $300.
Oh, wow.
What do these
sell for?
These sell for $40.99 retail.
I'm at that 50% benchmark,
right below them,
so you can get people
who have disposable income
John: Uki, I've been doing this
for 25 years.
Yes, sir.
[ Chuckles ]
This stuff
is everywhere.
I ??
I promise you
at the same price...
Yes.
...'cause I made it.
Okay.
No problem.
When I started FUBU,
I didn't put three sleeves
on a shirt.
Shirts have been
existing everywhere, too.
Doesn't mean that
this is not a great business.
What you're doing,
it is good.
Very good quality.
So now, let's get into
the business stuff.
The reason you want to buy
these bathing suits
Deane: This is the guy
which takes you to the top.
How old are you?
Do you mind if I ask?
I'm 27 years old.
27 years old.
Good for you.
All right.
Do you have any sales?
Okay.
The first official year is 2016.
Okay.                      Okay.
In 2016,
I made $271,000 in sales.
Good for you.
Greiner: Wow.
Okay.
Deane: Okay, so,
I've done trade shows.
I started off
taking pictures of Bermuda.
I do everything.
I'm a one?man show.
I started doing the pictures,
I do the marketing,
I designed
all of these bathing suits.
I do absolutely everything,
okay? I'm a hustler.
Keep on going.
I'll follow you, Uki.
Then I said,
"Hm, how do I get more people?"
So I said Kickstarter.
I did a Kickstarter...
Ahh.
...I asked for $10,000,
I got $30,000. Okay.
On these?
That was in 2016?
Do you own ??
This was 2016.
Okay.
What were your sales
so far this year?
This year, as of September,
I am at $300,000 in sales.
Good for you.
Good.
Uki Deane, 100%.
Okay.
Yeah, how many?
How many, Uki?
Right now, 25,000.
Frankel: Okay.
It's okay.
That's not bad.
No, it's okay.
It's not huge.
It's not huge.
Is that you?
So, here's the story
on this.
I said,
"What's the cheapest place
of whether or not you're able
to manage cash.
Deane:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
His point is just you
could've gone to Venice Beach.
You could've gone
to South Beach.
Good point.
I'm...
Like, you could've gone
anywhere a little bit closer,
a little
less expensive.
Photographers cost
about $5,000, okay?
You have to then
hire the models. Yes ??
No!
All these Inst??
All these millennials.
Don't you have a phone
with a camera?
I could've done it in Miami,
but I wanted
to build a lifestyle.
but they want to hear
a solid business plan from Uki
on how he's going to grow
his men's swim?short company,
Bermies.
Cuban: Uki, I think the future
of selling swimwear
Uki, listen,
your energy is fabulous.
Thank you.
Your passion
is fabulous,
Uki, I...
Yeah.
I...
I love the energy...
[ Laughter ]
...I love the passion.
I'm so tired of him.
Uki, why are you
arguing with him
when you have
one Sharkette left?
You should be asking her
what she wants to know
in case
she might want to invest.
I'm sorry. Bethenny,
is there anything else
you would like to know?
[ Laughs ]
No.
The ?? The thing is ??
The thing is...
[ Greiner laughs ]
...that
I don't know how ??
you guys
were probably all geniuses
Cuban:
Congrats, Uki.
Good luck, Uki.
But, gentlemen, seriously,
when you try them on
Cuban:
Congrats, Uki.
Bye.
He was great.
Good luck.
Deane: I think they made
a very big mistake.
I have given everything I have,
I quit my job,
