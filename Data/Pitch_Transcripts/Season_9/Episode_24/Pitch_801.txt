Hi,
I'm Anita Sun Eisenberg.
And I'm
Mariella Scott.
We're from
Los Angeles, California,
and we're Dermovia...
Lace Your Face.
Lace Your Face.
[ Laughter ]
We're seeking $350,000
for 10% equity
in our compan??
in our company.
Yeah, I?I stutter
on that one, too.
Masking has been a go?to
skincare treatment for ages.
Masks help
with hydration.
They clear your pores.
They even make all your other
beauty products work better.
But we've definitely
come a long way
since the green,
goopy, messy masks...
[ Laughter ]
...our moms used to use,
and thank goodness,
because I still have nightmares.
[ Chuckles ]
Sheet masks are the latest
development and beauty craze.
They've streamlined
the process,
but still face
their own set of challenges.
Sheet masks
are slippery and slimy,
and without a way
of securing it,
you have to stay
completely still
for the entire length
of the treatment
to prevent the mask
from slipping off your face
and the ingredients
from getting into your eyes.
That can take
up to an hour.
Who has time
for that?
[ Chuckles ]
That's where we come in.
We're transforming
the mask industry with...
Are you ready
for it?
Cuban: Ta?da.
Greiner: Yeah, we're ready.
Lace Your Face,
an innovative design
that allows you to multitask
while you mask.
Lace Your Face is made of
a cotton?stretch fabric
saturated in serum.
Wow.
It fastens to your face
with our patented ear hook.
[ Squealing ]
[ Laughs ]
I'll give you
all my money!
Looks like Halloween.
Eisenberg: The straps
not only secure the mask,
but it also offers
gentle compression,
which activates the body's
natural reparative response
and allows the product
to work better and faster.
Did they tell you this was
going to be on national TV
and repeat
20 times a day?
Yes.
Yes, and we wanted
to show you.
We're on a mission to give you
the best skin you deserve...
Wow.
...without sacrificing
your precious time.
So, Sharks,
who's ready to...
[ Laughter ]
...mask and multitask
with Lace Your Face?
[ Greiner chuckles ]
Wow, sure.
Can we see samples?
Scott:
Yes, of course.
Are they reusable,
or is this disposable?
Each mask has enough serum
that you can use it twice.
Oh, but it's not ??
right.
So two treatments.
It's a lacy,
stretchy fabric...
Yes.
Cuban: It's like putting
underwear on your face.
...so you're actually
taking your serum
and infusing it
all over this.
It's ?? These are in the pouches
saturated in serum.
Yeah.
I don't know
if it's attractive.
Oh, it's sexy.
Really?
I have a question,
'cause I use these.
I use ??
Hi, there, pretty.
You look handsome.
[ Laughter ]
I don't want
any of the small bills.
[ Laughter ]
No small bills.
I am ?? I use these,
and I know ??
I used one on the
plane. I often ?? People
think I'm crazy...
You put this
on the plane?
Greiner:
You used this?
I bring it ??
How do you
not scare people?
I do, but I don't care.
It's the plane. It's dark.
In Asia,
women mask every day.
I do the one
that the woman had on.
It's just
a pain in the ass.
Bethenny, would you wear that
on the plane?
I'd wear that to an event.
I mean, that looks beautiful.
[ Laughter ]
Thank you!
What does it cost you to put
together one of your packages?
Well, how to do sell,
first of all?
Yes, I didn't hear
the price before.
Scott: We sell
in a four?pack box for $55
and single masks
for $15 retail.
$55?
Frankel:
Oh, $55 for four.
Okay,
that's a lot.
Okay, so,
$55 for four...
Wait, is that with
the four packages, too?
Eisenberg: Yes.
So, our margins right now
are 80%.
Wow.
Um, so ?? so...
So what's it cost you
to make?
So what's it cost?
$3 for one pouch.
Our sales
are $1.3 million.
Over what period
of time?
Wow.
Our ?? I'm sorry?
Over what
period of time?
So, we started late 2015,
and we sold $150,000.
Our second year, 2016,
we did $450,000,
and this year,
we're tracking $750,000.
Wow.
Cuban:
Good for you.
Where are you selling?
Scott: We are in
major department stores ??
Nordstrom, Barneys...
Greiner: You are?
...and we're sold online.
Yes.
So you've really got
good distribution.
For me, the revolutionary
difference is, it stays on.
Yes.
Frankel: Very.
And I totally see
the convenience to that.
Do you have
a patent on this?
We have a patent
on this mask.
We actually have ??
You do.
Utility patent?
The technology.
So, we have two pending
utility patents on file,
and we have
an issued design patent.
With so much
in the margin, right,
so much
of the margin ??
which is great, first of all,
from an investor standpoint ??
but why is it
so much?
I'm a
medical aesthetician.
We formulated a wide variety
of masks and treatment
to mimic the treatment that
they could get in the clinic
at home.
Is that why there's
a premium cost, because...
Right, because this undergoes
a medical?grade sterilization.
This is beautiful packaging,
but it doesn't scream $55.
You could get a facial
for not much more,
and a facial
is more effective.
Mm.
So that's a lot.
$55 is my problem right now.
So ?? So, the thing with the
price point is that right now,
we are producing
in lower volume,
and on top of that,
the ingredients are all
naturally derived actives.
Ladies, this industry
has the highest margins
of almost
any other industry.
Right.
Massive margins,
I've learned,
invite
massive competition...
Right.
...that really doesn't want you
to be successful.
I see a lot of challenge
in the future.
So,
that's why...
It's not for me.
...we applied
for the patents.
It's not for me.
And you're scaring me.
I'm out.
[ Chuckles ]
I'll simplify it, guys.
I love the mask, I'll wear it
every day, but I'm out.
Eisenberg:
We were just process??
No, we were processing it.
Oh, my God, my bad.
Sorry.
Cuban: Wow.
I wanted
to explain ??
I wanted to explain more about
the price point of the mask.
Take it off, just so people
can see your beautiful faces.
Mariella and Anita,
thank you for educating, uh, me
on what
women go through,
but I don't know
anything about this,
uh, this world,
so I'm no help. I'm out.
6...5...
Eisenberg: Bethenny, would you
be able to take ??
We can't give away
that much equity.
Would you be able to take,
um, $350,000 for 15%?
Eisenberg:
Oh, my God!
It happens that quick.
Thanks, Lori.
All right,
I'll do it for 14%!
Thank you so much.
Greiner: You have
a million?unit order?
Thank you, Bethenny.
I'mma send you a fruit basket
and some wine.
Lori was who
we wanted to begin with,
and we couldn't
be happier.
Lori was, like ??
she's just sneaky,
and she just came right in
and swooped that deal up.
Think how good you'll be
at Halloween.
[ Laughs ]
That's what
I want to use it for.
Well ??
Lori, just send me bunch
of free product when you ??
I've never seen Lori become
a bottom?feeder like that.
I'm taking
that whole display.
Lori was like a buzzard
on a gut wagon.
[ Laughs ]
She was like a hyena
on a wounded animal!
Whenever we spent time
in the sun...
we use sunscreen.
[ Chuckles ]
But you know what, Sharks?
The majority of Americans
also consume alcohol regularly.
[ Can opens ]
that you can understand
any which way but Sunday.
The marketing in this business
is very difficult.
I'm out.
Okay.
My biggest challenge
is something you said.
TV ads
and all this type of stuff ??
it's a massive
amount of money
that you're gonna
have to spend.
I just think
it's a long journey.
I'm out.
