Hello, Sharks.
My name is Alfonso Tejada.
I was born in Bolivia,
live in Miami, Florida,
and I'm here today
to gain $300,000
in exchange for 10%
of my company, O. A. Foods.
We are the creators
of the greatest game changer
in the history of pasta.
I think we can all agree
that pasta's
a worldwide food favorite.
But no matter how much
people love to eat pasta,
they try to stay away from it.
Yeah, because they know
it's bad for you.
It hangs out
with a pretty rough crowd.
[ Laughs ]
Bad dudes like calories,
carbs, sugar, and gluten.
Boo.
I think it's time we say "adios"
to pasta and hello to Palmini!
Tejada:
Yeah, we're gonna feed you
with three different sets
of Palmini,
that way you can try it
with different sauces...
Grazie!
...and different flavors.
Frankel: Amazing.
What are we eating here?
Okay,
the first one is a salad.
With shrimp?
Salad.
Yeah, with shrimp.
It's a little bit spicy.
A whole plate of this
would have 200 calories.
But, Alfonso,
it doesn't taste like pasta.
Um...
It doesn't
taste like pasta, no.
Some people ?? Some people
think that it tastes...
I love it.
Yeah,
it's close enough to pasta.
Cuban: It's not bad, right?
It's not bad.
I feel a little disappointed.
I love pasta.
Frankel: No.
Zucchini noodles.
I love pasta, too,
but sometimes after I finish
eating pasta, I feel bloated,
and this,
you can eat as much as you want
and it's 90% water,
so...
But you could open a can
of hearts of palm
and eat
as much as you want
or spiralize zucchini
or cauliflower rice.
But I think we all thought
you were doing, like,
quinoa pasta...
Yeah.
...or spinach pasta.
This is just
a different?shaped vegetable.
But the thing is,
you know,
you have
a cool product here because ??
Yeah.
But it's a vegetable.
Well, what's wrong
with that? Because ??
It is a vegetable.
I don't know
what's wrong with that, either.
Because the wave
of the ??
No, look,
there's a lot of good reasons
to eat this
instead of pasta.
Right.
What's your background?
How do you know
food service?
So, I went to business school,
graduated summa cum laude
from the University of Florida,
then I moved to Bolivia to work
in my family's business.
We sell some agricultural
machinery in Bolivia.
While I was there,
I noticed that I had
really good access to quinoa.
Back then, in 2009,
nobody knew what quinoa was.
So I thought
it would be a good idea
to start importing quinoa
to the States,
because I knew
it was gonna explode.
And I'm offering you the both ??
the quinoa business and...
Oh, well,
how big is the quinoa business?
Oh, great answer.
This year,
we've sold so far $400,000.
Of quinoa?
Good for you.
Of the quinoa,
yeah.
Okay.
Then we started ??
Okay, Alfonso,
how big is the Palmini business?
Okay, so, the Palmini ??
I got my container
three months ago.
It's sold about 2,000 units
and I ran out of stock.
So,
what's the dollar amount?
$50,000 in Palmini
in these three months.
So,
how much is this?
This is
what you're selling today.
So, that's right now
$9.99 on Amazon,
and it's way too expensive.
This is effectively
hearts of palm
shredded in
a different way.
There's no other
innovation here
except for
the processing machinery.
So what's to stop Del Monte
or any big company
from just
making that machine
and processing hearts of palm
in this way?
Okay, first of all, it took us
two years to make the machine.
But they have
billions of dollars.
It's patent?pending.
It's patent?pending.
What's the patent on?
The process machine.
And we ??
On the machine to be able
to cut the hearts of palm
in the shape of linguine.
But that has happened
with everything.
The big guys
come in,
and then they can cut and ship
any shape they want.
Right.
I eat and use hearts of palm
fairly regularly.
They're very difficult
to deal with.
Whatever your process was,
it has to be really good,
because these are all
very uniform.
Yes.
How can you prevent the big guys
from doing this, though?
How can you prevent big
supermarkets just selling this?
Because I'm gonna get
one of you Sharks.
Well, you went
with the elephant.
Oh, that's the plan?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
how Alfonso
would deal with competition
for his hearts of palm
pasta business, Palmini.
How can you prevent the big guys
from doing this, though?
How can you prevent big
supermarkets just selling this?
Because I'm gonna get
one of your Sharks.
Well, you went
with the elephant.
Oh, that's the plan?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
When you run
with the elephants,
there's the quick
and there's the dead, right,
and if
you're quick enough,
you can stay
ahead of the elephant.
You can't own
how to chop a carrot.
You really can't.
You can do it ??
No,
but there's different processes
that impact speed,
delivery.
Listen ??
I love
how passionate you are.
This is
a huge, huge trend.
I think
that you should get into
this
alternative?foods space.
I like
cauliflower?crust pizza.
Someone should be making
carrot pasta.
I haven't seen
a whole line yet,
so you should be
the manufacturing guy.
But I don't see you
blowing the doors off with this,
because everybody can copy you,
so I'm out.
Yeah, I'm ?? I'm...that's...
Sorry, you have no idea
how hard it is to make.
Like...
John: Okay, so maybe that's why
you value the company.
$300,000 for 10%
means that you're saying
the company
is worth $3 million.
But I don't think that Del Monte
or any of them
are going to even
blink their eye
when this gets hot and
they're just gonna do something
very similar
or even better.
I don't believe it's worth
that value, so I'm out.
Okay.
Alfonso,
let me tell you where I'm at.
I love pasta.
I don't eat as much of it
because of those bad guys ??
calories,
trying to watch my weight ??
but I don't believe in
a sliced?up
vegetable substitute for pasta.
I don't see it.
I'm out.
Okay, I just want to say
one thing.
I am convinced
that this is gonna be
what Splenda is to sugar
or what Diet Coke is to Coke.
Like, eventually, because we're
just scratching the surface ??
No way.
Greiner:
Wait a minute.
Hello.
Hi. [ Chuckles ]
All right.
I freaking love this.
Yes!
I think
this is awesome.
15 calories, 1.5 grams of fat,
and no sugar!
This is genius,
and I would like
to be your partner
in taking this everywhere.
And Mark loves it so much,
too...
So much.
Yes!
...that he said,
"You know what,
let's do it together."
A lot of work in this,
as you know.
Lot of work,
yes.
I mean,
got to fix the packaging.
Absolutely.
Can I say
one more thing?
Herjavec: No!
There's an offer coming!
No!
[ Laughs ]
Be quiet!
Oh, sorry, sorry.
There's an offer coming.
Yeah, sorry, sorry.
Okay, well, because you're
getting two fantastic Sharks,
$300,000...for 30%.
Whoa!
Run...like...
Alfonso,
did you see that?
There was all that love,
and then...
Well, but you understand
how much work...
You got to pay
to play.
Right.
Herjavec: Wow.
And let me
tell you something.
People always think
that there is, like,
an elevator
to the top, right?
There's no shortcuts
in business.
Everybody has to take
the stairs.
But if you have
the two of us,
that's an express elevator
to the top.
Can you do the $300,000
for 18%?
No.
18%?
Okay, let's do 20%.
Come on.
Wow,
you got to love that.
It's a really good product.
He loves his business.
I'm telling you, Mark.
I promise
it's gonna be worth it.
We're saying the same thing,
Alfonso. We obviously think so.
$300,000, 25%.
Oh!
You got a second.
You got to say yes
right now.
Wow.
