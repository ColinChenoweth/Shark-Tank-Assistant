Hello, Sharks.
My name is Alfonso Tejada.
I was born in Bolivia,
live in Miami, Florida,
Tejada:
Yeah, we're gonna feed you
with three different sets
of Palmini,
that way you can try it
with different sauces...
Grazie!
But, Alfonso,
it doesn't taste like pasta.
Um...
It doesn't
taste like pasta, no.
Some people ?? Some people
think that it tastes...
I love it.
Yeah,
it's close enough to pasta.
Cuban: It's not bad, right?
It's not bad.
I feel a little disappointed.
I love pasta.
Frankel: No.
Zucchini noodles.
I love pasta, too,
but sometimes after I finish
eating pasta, I feel bloated,
Okay, Alfonso,
how big is the Palmini business?
Okay, so, the Palmini ??
I got my container
three months ago.
how Alfonso
would deal with competition
for his hearts of palm
pasta business, Palmini.
How can you prevent the big guys
from doing this, though?
How can you prevent big
supermarkets just selling this?
Because I'm gonna get
one of your Sharks.
Well, you went
with the elephant.
Oh, that's the plan?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
When you run
with the elephants,
Alfonso,
let me tell you where I'm at.
I love pasta.
I don't eat as much of it
because of those bad guys ??
calories,
trying to watch my weight ??
but I don't believe in
a sliced?up
vegetable substitute for pasta.
I don't see it.
I'm out.
Okay, I just want to say
one thing.
I am convinced
that this is gonna be
what Splenda is to sugar
or what Diet Coke is to Coke.
Like, eventually, because we're
just scratching the surface ??
No way.
Greiner:
Wait a minute.
Hello.
Hi. [ Chuckles ]
All right.
I freaking love this.
Yes!
I think
this is awesome.
Run...like...
Alfonso,
did you see that?
We're saying the same thing,
Alfonso. We obviously think so.
$300,000, 25%.
Oh!
You got a second.
You got to say yes
right now.
Wow.
