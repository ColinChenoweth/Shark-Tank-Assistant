Hi, Sharks.
My name is Brooks Powell.
I'm the founder of Thrive+,
Okay.
Powell: Okay.
So, in Asian countries,
they would steep it as a tea
"I'm gonna rethink my"...
Cuban: But, Brooks,
that's not the point, right?
Using nanoparticles for delivery
is not something
that's exclusive to Princeton
or anybody.
So, Brooks, you know what
just happened here today?
You had
a Cuban heist.
Herjavec:
Thank you, Brooks.
Thank you, guys.
John:
Thank you.
Thank you.
Powell: It was like a bloodbath
in there.
I think a Shark could've sped up
our timeline of our company
by a year or two.
