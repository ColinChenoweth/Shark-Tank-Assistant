Hi, Sharks.
My name is Brooks Powell.
I'm the founder of Thrive+,
and I'm here asking for $400,000
for 10% of my company.
Herjavec: Wow.
Wow.
Just three months ago...
Whoo!
...I graduated
from Princeton University...
Okay.
Powell: Okay.
So, in Asian countries,
they would steep it as a tea
and it made them "feel better"
after consuming alcohol.
Neuroscientists wanted to see
if there's actually
any sort of scientific evidence
for this,
and what they found
when they injected
this dihydromyrecetin into rats,
they could instantly
sober up rats.
They could prevent rats
from becoming alcoholics...
But I want to understand
how many rats,
how long
was the study...
Wh?? Are you serious?
Greiner: Seriously.
Oh, my God, Lori!
John:
Are you able to ??
I'm gonna ??
Wait, wait!
How old were the rats,
and how many cocktails ??
I'm gonna tell you
why that's important.
Lori, you hang out with
a lot of rats at the bars?
Greiner:
I'm gonna tell you why.
What we want to know is
the quality of the study.
So, I want to know
how big is the study?
Cuban: We want to know
the quality of the study.
Yes. What's the quality
of the study? How big?
So, this was ??
this was actually funded
by a $2.5 million
government research grant,
and the journal was
the Journal of Neuroscience...
Okay.
...which if you get published
in there,
that's the height
of your career.
This is why Big Pharma companies
didn't go after it...
Ugh.
...because it's
a naturally occurring
organic compound
that they can't get
intellectual property around.
But can ??
can I do it?
Can I go make a product
using that?
Cuban:
Yes, of course.
So, I'm reading this
right as it's published.
I run to my Princeton
neuroscience professor.
He gets so excited about it.
I said, "Look, I really want
to bring this to the world,"
and I finally reached an alumnus
specializing in
chemical?patent law.
And so basically,
what he said is
if you can combine it
with other ingredients,
then what you can do
is create a formula,
and then you can get
a novel patent
and now you have something that
can be better than competition.
How did you prove it?
Who are you
marketing this to?
Wait, how did you prove ??
how did you prove
that your formula
was more effective
than the molecule itself?
We had
a small human study.
There's a problem
with dihydromyrecetin.
It has a bioavailability
of only 4%.
So what that means...
What does that mean?
...is you could take
1,000 milligrams
of dihydromyrecetin ??
that's how much
is in a dose there ??
and only 40 milligrams
are actually gonna get into your
bloodstream and do something.
Now, there's only a few labs
in the world.
One of the labs is at Princeton.
What they can make
is nanoparticles.
Nanoparticles can unlock
the bioavailability problem ??
John: Are our ??
You know what?
Are our phone calls gonna be
this long?
Let's get into the reality
of where you're going with this.
Tell me if I'm wrong,
that using the technology
that you licensed
from Princeton
is how you're gonna use
nanoparticles
to do a delivery of DHM
at a much higher
bioavailability level.
You nailed it.
I know.
This is
a very confusing presentation,
because
I'm kind of lost.
Listen, I'm not a genius
and I don't know about science
and I don't even know half of
what you guys are talking about.
That's the point.
I'd like to know who
you're marketing the product to,
who
the target audience is.
Yeah, but we've got to know
if the product ??
it doesn't matter.
If the product isn't
legit, it doesn't matter.
John: Yeah, if someone
wants maybe out
for ethical reasons
or science.
It does matter,
because I don't even understand
by looking at the packaging
what it is,
who it's marketed to.
Is it marketed
to 20?year?olds?
We don't know if it's BS or not.
We got to find that out first.
Are we gonna dissect a rat, too?
But most supplements
are BS.
It's m??
It's packaging.
Well, he's trying
to tell us otherwise.
He's got ingredients that are
the same in any other product.
Wait, how ??
hold on, hold on, hold on.
So here's where the BS meters go
[Imitates beeping].
Saying "nanoparticles" sounds,
"Wow, this must be amazing."
Using na??
I run
when I hear "nanoparticles."
I don't even know
what that means.
Yeah.
I run. I hear "nanoparticles,"
I run.
But ??
It's new ??
It's new technology.
When you try this product once,
you'd be like,
"I'm gonna rethink my"...
Cuban: But, Brooks,
that's not the point, right?
Using nanoparticles for delivery
is not something
that's exclusive to Princeton
or anybody.
There's a thousand
different companies
competing in that area.
They might have a certain way to
do it that they own the IP for,
but there's alternative ways
to do it.
Yes.
We're locking
all of those down.
But, Mark, listen ??
This is my??
I'm in the alcohol business.
[ Indistinct shouting ]
I would've been the person
to do this.
Good luck, I'm out.
So, Brooks, you know what
just happened here today?
You had
a Cuban heist.
Herjavec:
Thank you, Brooks.
Thank you, guys.
John:
Thank you.
Thank you.
Powell: It was like a bloodbath
in there.
I think a Shark could've sped up
our timeline of our company
by a year or two.
But that doesn't mean we can't
go on and be wildly successful.
I think 365 days from now,
they're gonna look at it and go,
"Man,
I could've made $10 million."
Do I get a credit
for that science class?
It's "Shark Tank."
Yeah.
You're supposed to pitch
a business.
Mark ??
No, it's "Mark's Tank."
But you know ??
No, no.
Do you think it's okay
for everybody who watches,
because we don't get into
the details, to get ripped off?
[ Indistinct shouting ]
Because it's all about
the business and not ??
Don't put words
in my mouth.
Okay,
then tell me.
The premise of our show
is you have a business.
There's a reason we do
due diligence after the fact.
But the people ??
I have to give him
a certain amount of credibility.
Wrong, wrong,
wrong, wrong.
So you ?? So you're so arrogant
that you believe, in an hour,
you can decide whether
the science behind it
is real or not?
I'm arrogant enough
to think
that I'm gonna ask
the questions.
My approach is, when I see ??
when my antennas go up
and I think
there's a potential rip?off,
I want to know
if it's a rip?off.
I don't disagree with you,
but I also think
whoever's pitching here
needs to control the room.
Control the room.
Yeah,
but he's not ??
You're presenting.
Then go yell
at him.
You got to control
the room.
Then you got to go
yell at him.
Bring him back ?? Bring him back
out here. We'll yell at him.
