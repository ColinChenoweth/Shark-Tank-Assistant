Hi, Sharks! I'm Jason Burns.
I'm from Calabasas, California,
but I'm better known as
the Fidget Man from Fidgetland.
That's right.
I'm here seeking $50,000
in exchange for 10% equity
in my company, Fidgetland.
Like millions of people
around the world, I have A. D. D.
And I really have A. D. D.
Not like "Oh, he has A. D. D."
I really have A. D. D.
[ Laughter ]
Which means I have a hard time
focusing and I'm full of energy.
I'm sure you know people
like me, and unfortunately,
you're familiar with
some of our annoying habits.
Things like bouncing knees,
tapping pencils, clicking pens,
nail biting, hair twirling.
The list goes on and on and on.
Well, let me tell you ??
we do these annoying,
fidgety?type habits to help us
burn off excess energy
and to keep the part of our
brain that gets bored occupied
so the other part can
pay attention and focus.
But even though
these habits might help us,
they're extremely distracting
and drive people
around us crazy.
I can't tell you how many times
I've been on a plane
or in a meeting
and someone's told me
to stop bouncing my knee.
I'm that guy.
Well, I was that guy,
until I created
a line of products
that burns excess energy,
keeps your brain occupied
and focused,
and most importantly, doesn't
disturb the people around you.
Because our products
are discreet.
?Yes, take it out.
?Thank you, Jason.
?There you go.
?Thank you.
Is it all the same design,
all of them?
Burns: No. So we have
eight different models.
So each of you have two,
and then I have other models
up here if you guys
want to try them.
But basically,
just put it in your hand,
and it'll come naturally.
Just let it roll in your fingers
and play with it.
You had it on your thumb.
Is that what you're...
I just had it on my thumb
just to hold it,
but there's no wrong way
to play with it at all.
Jason, how did you
create your first one?
When I was in 11th grade,
I was diagnosed with A. D. D.,
and the woman who diagnosed me
said that my A. D. D.
was so severe that I would
never be able to survive
at a four?year university
and I shouldn't try to pursue
a job that required
any type of education.
I was fortunate enough
that my pediatrician
was somewhat
of an expert in A. D. D.
And this is back in 1988.
So he put me on medicine,
and overnight, my life changed.
And it was the first time
I could ever
pay attention in school.
And my grades started to,
you know, literally
go through the roof.
And it was the first time
I could pay attention.
I graduated from
the University of Arizona
in four years with a 3.4 GPA.
?Good for you. Wow.
?That's great.
And I majored in business
and then went to work
in entertainment.
I worked in the entertainment
industry for over 20 years.
And it was when
I was working in production ??
I always needed something
to stop my knee from bouncing,
and so, ever since
I was a little kid,
I've always invented and made
things out of other things.
And so first thing I, you know,
went and looked in the garage
to see what we had.
We had bike chain.
I look some bike chain...
?Oh.
?...took some key rings,
and put it together, and that's
how I made my first one.
How long have you
been in business?
I made my first
fidget in 2007.
Since 2007, how many
of these have you sold?
A little over 50,000 of them.
And how much
in dollars is that?
A little north of $500,000.
Well, you have my respect.
That's more than
I expected you to say.
This year, how many
of these will you sell?
We're on track
to do over $500,000 this year.
?In this?
?Fidget's hot right now.
I started making these
just for myself,
and I put a couple on eBay
and gave them to friends,
and year after year,
all through word of mouth,
it just kind of
kept going and going.
So you're doing
this full?time.
I do this full?time, yeah.
I quit my career,
and I've been the Fidget Man
from Fidgetland ever since.
What do you
sell them for?
So they range in price
from between $8 and $15.
And our cost to make them ranges
between $1.35 and $2.69.
So we have 80% markup.
?I can't imagine there's not
a ton of competitors.
Yeah, they're ?? yes,
there are competitors.
And people have knocked me off.
I have to tell you ??
I mean, it's very soothing.
It's really cool.
Jason, how are you gonna
sell half a million?
Is it just online?
So, yeah.
Right now,
we're about 85% online,
through our website
and through Amazon.
But primarily on the web.
How do people find you?
Our growth has been pretty
phenomenal and amazing.
My first year doing it
full?time, we did $88,000.
And then,
since I've done it full?time,
we've done $371,000 in sales.
Now, is a lot of it
people searching for "fidget"
and "fidget spinners"
and then seeing you
and seeing you
as a valid alternative?
Yeah, more or less.
You're not
buying ads today.
I just hired
a digital marketing company
to help me with advertising.
'Cause up until now ??
So you've got to be
making a lot of money.
What do you expect your
net profit to be this year?
$175,000.
Why not more?
'Cause you said you were
gonna do $500,000 in sales.
We'll do $500,000.
Yeah, your margins
are 70?plus percent.
?Right.
?He's buying advertising.
?Well, yeah.
?Well, no, he said he wasn't.
?No, this year we will.
?You're going to? Okay.
Look, what you've accomplished
is wonderful and amazing,
but I don't know
how I could help this,
because it's a specialty
market trying to convert
to a wider base
of a market.
That's not a sale
that I think
is gonna play
to my strengths.
So for those
reasons, I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
You seem lovely.
Yes.
I love your story
of overcoming the hardships.
Um, just personally...
For me, tactilely,
touching this,
I'm not having like,
a good fidget experience.
?So let me...
?[ Laughs ]
Here's the thing ??
that's part of what's,
and I don't mean to cut you off,
but part of fidgeting is,
and I call myself a fidget
whisperer in a sense,
everyone fidgets differently,
and what one person
might like
somebody else might not.
I don't think I'm a fair
judge of this because
I'm not the person
that would sit and fidget.
It's just not me.
I'm out.
?Jason...
?Yes?
I just have to admit,
it's a little infectious.
I've been messing around with it
since you got out here.
And as I'm fidgeting,
I'm trying to think
what the multiple is
for public fidget companies.
[ Laughter ]
What did the last one
trade at, Kevin?
Exactly.
It's just ??
It's too small.
It's too small for me.
I admire what
you've done, and...
?Thank you.
?...at the end of the day,
look, I appreciate the
opportunity to learn the story.
But it's not for me.
I'm out.
All righty. Uh, I think for ??
what's important is that it's,
like I said, we're in
the special?needs market,
but I think there's a much
broader market out there for us.
Corcoran: I have a child
who's 11, and she's A. D. D.
And she's got
the wiggle leg thing,
which I actually
don't find annoying,
but I'm crazy about her.
This is kind of
a cause for me.
Okay.
I love these A. D. D. types,
and half of them
are real geniuses
if only you could find a good
slot to put them in, right?
And my most productive people
that I've worked with
my whole life usually have some
kind of a curveball in learning,
and I seek them out.
In fact, if I were to make
a list of my top, say,
seven or eight entrepreneurs
I've invested in
on "Shark Tank," I would say
all but one have
a learning disability,
so it's a turn?on for me.
I hear somebody's got
a learning disability,
and they're my people,
so to speak,
and probably because
I was so terribly abused
in school as the dumb kid.
Right. Yes.
I'm gonna make you,
of course your $50,000 offer,
but for 20%.
But the $50,000 has to be spent
entirely on marketing costs.
Entirely marketing costs.
It's well?calculated...
Right.
...well?planned?out,
and we do it together.
Right.
Because I don't want
anything thrown up
against a board.
It's not a lot of money,
but I want it well?spent.
Got it.
I'd love the opportunity
to tell you where I am.
Please.
All right.
So, I come from a time,
'cause I'm very old,
where they didn't
diagnose A. D. D.
They called you hyperactive.
And that's what I was.
And it is
incredibly infectious.
I've been sitting here
the whole time.
I haven't been able
to put it down.
I usually shake my leg
when I'm up here,
and it's really
kind of calmed me down.
I'll give you $50,000 for...
What did you offer?
I said 20%.
I'll give it to you for 15%.
Whoa!
Narrator: Three Sharks are out.
Jason has two offers on the
table, from Barbara and Robert,
for his fidget toy company,
Fidgetland.
I'll give you $50,000 for...
What did you offer?
I said 20%.
I'll give it to you for 15%.
?Ooh.
?Whoa!
?Undercut her.
?Who would've thunk it?
You came in here
with a bicycle chain
and an elastic band,
and you've got two offers.
This is amazing.
Uh, this is so fun.
I have to tell you.
This is like, the greatest.
This is so awesome.
Jason, you've got to get ??
you've got to really
get focused.
?This is amazing.
?Yeah.
?Maybe you need a fidget.
?And so you've got to
make a decision.
?I always have many fidgets.
?I got three.
?With all due respect to Robert,
okay, he's had that experience,
he's had the same issue,
but I'm a little bit more
steeped in it, honestly, okay?
I'm the poster child
of the kid that made good,
who had a real severe
learning disability.
So, Barbara, are you
willing to match his 15%?
I've got a kid
that graduated from
an Ivy League school
who couldn't read
till he was 10 because
I outwitted the system
and figured out how he was
gonna become a superstar.
And now I have another
kid down the pike
who I have
to pour myself into.
Barbara, stop selling.
Let him make a decision.
No, no. What they have in common
is a passionate mother.
I treat my businesses as though
they are my children.
My entrepreneurs don't fail
unless there's nothing else
I can do to let them not fail.
So, you'd be actually
out of your mind
to take the offer from him.
Yeah, I ??
But go right ahead.
Barbara's
an incredible woman.
She has an incredible family,
and obviously this is
a great cause,
but you know,
with all due respect
to Barbara,
I also see it
as a great business.
And I'm not gonna share my level
of knowledge about the space,
and I think I can support you
on that and help you with it.
Plus, I don't need to take
20% of your business.
You've got to make a decision.
This is your moment.
Barbara,
would you consider 15%?
I don't think so, no.
Barbara, I would
love to do a deal.
?You're a smart guy.
?Bingo.
?Congrats, Barb.
?Okay.
?Congrats.
?Thank you so much.
I'm gonna need
more fidgeters.
?Thank you so much.
?I hope you remember,
you did the deal with me.
You remember?
?Are you kidding?
?Good.
[ Laughter ]
That's who I wanted
to do it with.
Oh, yeah?
You're full of crap.
?Congratulations.
?I appreciate it.
?Thank you so much.
?Congratulations, Jason.
Thank you. Whoo?hoo!
That's awesome!
I'll give it a heel?tap.
Whoo?hoo!
I'm just ??
I'm through the roof.
I just can't believe
that they got it.
And to me, that was what
I hoped was
that people would
get what it is.
And they got it.
And to get two offers
in "Shark Tank" is amazing.
I'm just like ??
this is the greatest.
It's the greatest day.
It's amazing.
