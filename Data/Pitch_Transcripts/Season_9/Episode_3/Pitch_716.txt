Hi, I'm Brighton Jones.
Dalley: Well, that's the thing.
We'll probably need to
dismiss these guys so you'll
stop staring at their biceps
Jones: All right, Sharks. We
brought samples for each of you.
Robert.
?Here we go, Barbara.
?So what you're looking at
is a specially curated
selection of our rings.
You have different options.
?Thank you.
?The ones on your right...
?Thanks. Appreciate it.
...are loose rings that
we took a guess were your sizes,
so you can try those on.
Most people tell us that
30 seconds after they put it on,
they forget that
it's even there.
?They're all plastic?
?They're made of silicone.
That's silicone rubber.
Okay, so in America,
how many people do you think
Dalley:
Not everybody does, though.
Some people just forget about
it, don't think about it.
What do you actually
sell one ring for?
Anywhere from
$11.99 to $39.99.
Dalley:
You want to do it?
12.5%?
Herjavec:
No, I'm gonna stick at 15%.
Okay. The last thing
would be ??
do you guys have interest
in something together?
'Cause the wedding platform
is big for us.
Not just the engagement side,
but then also we get people
buying for, like,
their bridesmaids.
O'Leary: Are you thinking
through my offer?
It costs you a lot less
if you're actually
gonna be successful.
Because it goes away
after basically 30 months.
I've already done the math.
I don't want
to play with Kevin.
[ Laughs ] Okay.
I think access to the platform
is worth something,
but, also, if you
really think through my offer,
it costs you a lot less
if you believe
you're gonna be successful.
You guys are gonna
figure it out.
$500,000, 15%.
Maybe they're
smart guys.
They're smart guys,
no doubt.
They're definitely
smart guys.
[ Sighs ] Kevin, thank you
very much for the offer.
?Uh?oh.
?We're going to go ahead
