Hi, I'm Brighton Jones.
And I'm Aaron Dalley.
We're from
Salt Lake City, Utah,
and we're the founders
of Enso Rings.
We're seeking $500,000
in exchange for 7.5%
of our product that's disrupting
the jewelry industry.
Sharks, do you know
what this is?
If you're thinking
"wedding ring," you're wrong.
It's an F. A. D. ??
a finger amputation device.
It might sound crazy,
but it's true.
Yeah.
Whether you're at the gym,
on the job,
or simply unloading your car,
at any moment, your ring
could catch on something
and severely damage your finger,
or even rip it right off.
It's called ring avulsion,
and it happens to over 150,000
people per year.
Enso Rings are made
of a proprietary silicone
that's engineered
to take a beating
and adapt to your
active lifestyle.
And most importantly,
they're designed to break away
when caught on something.
In short, Enso Rings
are the most stylish,
safe alternative to metal rings
and wedding bands.
Sharks, this is
a standard metal band.
Just like the ones
you're wearing right now.
And this...
is award?winning professional
body builder Garrett Coelho.
That, my dear, is a man.
Barbara, stay in your seat.
Aah!
His biceps represent over
500 pounds of pulling force,
which is more than enough
to tear your finger right off.
Garrett, what do you say
we show them what happens
when their ring
gets caught on something?
Pull!
?Ohh!
?Ugh!
?Ugh!
?Wow!
?Oh, my God!
?Now, let's try that again,
with a real finger on a human
hand and an Enso Ring.
Jones: And let's
up the stakes this time
and triple
the pulling power.
Luke, Darnell,
come on out!
?Oh, God!
?Now, what about this, Lori?
?[ Laughs ]
?And please, whatever you do,
do not try this at home.
All right,
you guys ready?
In 3, 2, 1 ?? pull!
Oh, yes.
And that's the power
of an Enso Ring.
So it just broke.
?It just came apart.
?Thank you, guys.
I appreciate it.
?Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I don't believe it.
Let's do it again.
[ Laughter ]
Dalley: Well, that's the thing.
We'll probably need to
dismiss these guys so you'll
stop staring at their biceps
and listen to the rest
of our presentation, so...
Corcoran: Thank you,
gentlemen. Thank you.
[ Blows kiss ]
Jones: All right, Sharks. We
brought samples for each of you.
Robert.
?Here we go, Barbara.
?So what you're looking at
is a specially curated
selection of our rings.
You have different options.
?Thank you.
?The ones on your right...
?Thanks. Appreciate it.
...are loose rings that
we took a guess were your sizes,
so you can try those on.
Most people tell us that
30 seconds after they put it on,
they forget that
it's even there.
?They're all plastic?
?They're made of silicone.
That's silicone rubber.
Okay, so in America,
how many people do you think
get up in the morning
and say,
"Wow, I hope my finger
doesn't get ripped off
when I catch my ring in a rope
pulled by a guy
from Mount Zeus"?
Zero.
But that's the problem.
That is a big problem.
You don't have it
when you need it.
How do you get anybody even
interested in understanding
why they need an Enso Ring?
150,000 people
in the U. S. alone, per year,
have a ring?avulsion
accident.
And that's your
opening marketing...
But how many of those people
get their fingers ripped off
versus pulled, strained?
You guys might've
seen Jimmy Fallon's.
It took him off the air
for two weeks.
He was walking in his kitchen,
tripped on the rug,
ring gets caught
on the countertop,
and nearly tears the finger off.
Wow.
If you have
an active lifestyle,
you're constantly taking
your ring off, putting it on.
And we haven't even talked
about all the applications.
These are really
popular among nurses.
They match their scrubs.
We're talking about
firefighters, electricians,
physicians, the military.
They can't wear metal rings.
Tell us about you,
how you came to do this.
Sure.
Brighton and I,
we've been friends
pretty much our whole lives,
and we've always wanted
to start a business together.
A few years ago, I had
a rock?climbing accident.
I fell,
and on the way down,
my wedding ring
got caught on the rock.
And there was
that split second ??
Why would you even
wear a wedding ring
while you're climbing?
It's not something
you think about.
You don't wake up
in the morning and say,
"My finger's gonna
get torn off."
I always take my ring off
when I'm working out,
playing basketball.
Dalley:
Not everybody does, though.
Some people just forget about
it, don't think about it.
What do you actually
sell one ring for?
Anywhere from
$11.99 to $39.99.
Herjavec: And what does
it cost you to make it?
It ranges from 70 cents
up to $4.00.
Wow. I'm gonna guess,
you guys have a ton of sales.
Actually, in the past
18 months,
we've done $3.8 million
in sales.
Whoa.
Unbelievable.
I knew it.
This year, we're projected to do
a little over $5 million.
What?
So on the $11.99 ring,
this one I guess,
it costs you 70 cents?
Correct.
[ Laughs ] I love this.
And you sell this one for a man,
which is the largest,
for how much?
?$39.99.
?$39.
?How much does that one cost?
?That one costs anywhere
from $2 to $4.
Why would that cost $4?
We wanted to get a band
that looked like a metal ring.
Everything out there,
we thought looked cheap.
We use actual gold on the gold
ring, so it gets expensive.
It has elements of gold ??
flecks of gold in it?
?It does.
?Wow.
I respect sales.
Doesn't matter what I think,
it matters what
the market thinks.
And I'm very impressed.
Where are you selling them?
It's all through the dot?com
and marketplaces right now.
So it's all online.
It's been an amazing
social?media push.
You're real expense
is customer acquisition,
'cause you're
selling online, right?
And it's a fear sale.
So you're scaring
the hell out of people
to cause them
to buy something.
So this last month,
what were your sales?
What did you spend
on marketing?
Yeah.
Last month, best month ever.
$460,000
in sales last month.
Okay.
We spent about 40%
on average.
You guys will spend
$2 million?plus
in advertising
and marketing?
Sure.
You guys are a marketing company
that just found a product.
That's not a bad thing.
And you're
obviously good at it.
But I just ??
scaring the hell out of people
that their finger
might get yanked off,
I just don't see that
as a long?term business.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
This fear?based aspect
is what we started with,
because that's
what we understood.
But our largest
market right now,
it's about it being
a jewelry trend.
Here ?? Here's the thing.
I'm familiar
with silicone because
I make a lot of products
in silicone.
There's just tons
of these out there.
So I'm not taking away
that you don't have great sales,
because you do have
great sales.
But as an investor,
when I look at something,
I look at what's out there
and then I think about,
what's gonna be
the likelihood
making my return
on my investment.
While you might be great
and your sales are great,
I think it's a little dicey
because there's so much
competition.
But our model ??
For those reasons,
I'm sorry, I'm out.
Thanks, Lori.
Thanks, Lori.
I find your messaging
is mixed up.
I'm not sure it's
a message ?? save your finger,
or ?? this is
a fashion statement.
And trying to relay
both of those,
and even in your packaging,
I don't see that messaging,
so I don't find that clarity
that's gonna hook in
the customer that you want.
So with your great
presentation skills,
I say think of your next
business as fast as you can.
I'm out.
[ Robert laughs ]
I like to think,
probably arrogantly, that
I understand a little bit
about every business.
There's been a couple
of times in nine seasons,
people have come out,
and I'm sitting here,
and I'm going, "I have no clue
why people are buying this."
That was Tipsy Elves,
and it was Sand Cloud.
Tipsy Elves was
$72 million this year.
?Wow.
?What I learned in investing
in those guys is ??
there was a message
behind their product even they
didn't understand at the time.
So sometimes your consumers
tell you and create the message.
Barb is dead?on.
Your message
is very confusing.
But $5 million worth
of customers can't be wrong.
So I'll make you an offer.
?You're kidding!
?Robert?
You're really losing it,
Robert.
These guys are great.
I love these guys.
I'll give you
the $500,000 for...
...20%.
It's a pure flyer for me.
Your offer is $500K
for 20%.
Thank you, Kevin. I can speak
for myself, you know?
Okay, because I, too,
have an offer.
$500,000 for...
I, too, have an offer
that you should hear.
Kevin, I can
speak for myself.
I find you
exceedingly greedy.
Let me give you an alternative.
When you walked in here,
you pitched us on this
$6 million?plus valuation.
I was gonna give you
the finger,
but now I'm wearing your ring,
and I'm feeling the love.
I really like it.
To me, the opportunity here
is to leverage that platform,
you call the Something Wonderful
platform, to reduce
customer?acquisition costs.
And I've got millions
of customers.
I'm gonna give you
the $500,000 as a loan.
And because you can afford it,
you're gonna pay me $2 per order
until I make back $1.5 million,
then it goes away.
And I was 5% equity
to be your banker
and the person that provides you
help in customer acquisition.
I would consider
a counter.
Okay, thank you very much.
So you see something in it.
There's something here
for sure.
I'd feel a lot better
if one of you knew
what the something was.
I'm okay with that.
I mean, if you're gonna
stand there and say "We're only
rings," there's no business.
No. I like that. Thank you.
Would you be willing to do 10%?
[ Chuckles ]
Uh, no.
But let's talk about
the evaluation, I guess.
Where are we coming up short
with the numbers
we gave you initially?
Are you kidding?
The risk is huge.
It's just
risk/comfort thing.
But here's what
I will do.
I'll split the difference
between the 10% and the 20%.
I'll do it at 15%.
You guys should grab
that money and run. My God.
Cuban: Are you kidding me?
You guys are crazy to take that.
If you believe what you've said,
you're crazy to take it.
Dalley:
You want to do it?
12.5%?
Herjavec:
No, I'm gonna stick at 15%.
Okay. The last thing
would be ??
do you guys have interest
in something together?
'Cause the wedding platform
is big for us.
Not just the engagement side,
but then also we get people
buying for, like,
their bridesmaids.
O'Leary: Are you thinking
through my offer?
It costs you a lot less
if you're actually
gonna be successful.
Because it goes away
after basically 30 months.
I've already done the math.
I don't want
to play with Kevin.
[ Laughs ] Okay.
I think access to the platform
is worth something,
but, also, if you
really think through my offer,
it costs you a lot less
if you believe
you're gonna be successful.
You guys are gonna
figure it out.
$500,000, 15%.
Maybe they're
smart guys.
They're smart guys,
no doubt.
They're definitely
smart guys.
[ Sighs ] Kevin, thank you
very much for the offer.
?Uh?oh.
?We're going to go ahead
and take Robert's.
Yes!
?Congratulations.
?Thank you.
Thank you.
That was awesome.
I don't understand it,
but I'm so excited.
We'll explain it to you
along the way.
Thank you, guys.
Thank you.
Appreciate your time.
Yes.
Yes, brother!
We did it!
Yeah, "Shark Tank"!
It's possibly Kevin's would have
worked out better financially,
but Enso's a force for good,
and Robert's someone
who gets that.
It's incredible.
You could
see it in his eyes
from the beginning,
he was into it.
We love that kind of passion.
Narrator: Next into the Tank
is a product
to make a favorite
beverage even better.
