Hi. My name
is Charles Nick.
My name's Taylor Minor,
from Cedarville, Ohio.
We're seeking $100,000
for 10% interest in our company,
Third Wave Water.
I own a coffee shop,
and my customers
constantly ask me
how the coffee
that they brew at home
can taste just as delicious
as it does in the cafe.
Eager aficionados
can buy the best beans,
grind fresh daily,
use the best drip systems,
and still not come close
to tasting as good.
You don't need
expensive contraptions,
you need the right water.
You're delicious cup of coffee
consists of 98% water,
so it's so important
that you use the right
type of water
when you brew.
So what is
the right water, you ask?
Well, it's a delicate balance
of minerals in the water
that make it perfect
for brewing.
Mini cafes install large,
complex water systems
just to make
perfect brewing water.
Well, that's simply not
practical for home use.
That's why we created
Third Wave Water.
Simply add this stick
of precise minerals
to a gallon of distilled water,
and you're ready to brew.
We've shipped to over
50 countries and all 50 states.
Many of those customers have
stated that they will never
go back to brewing coffee
with any other water again.
Join us as we help
coffee drinkers around the world
finally experience coffee
like it was meant to be.
Sharks,
who's ready for coffee?
?Bring it on.
?Yeah, bring it on.
So, this is Dylan.
He won the U. S. Brewers Cup
using Third Wave Water.
?Did he really?
?There's a U. S. Brewers Cup?
There is.
And he won the U. S. Brewers Cup
using Third Wave Water.
?Grazie.
?Here's the Third Wave Water.
And L. A. tap water.
Thank you very much.
Oh, you have two?
Bad water and your water.
?Yes, sir.
?So in the black cup,
that's local L. A. tap water.
?So let us all try that first.
?Wow.
?Yeah.
?Now, that's good L. A.
?That sucks, that coffee.
?It's horrible.
?Let's be real here.
?Now I'm trying the...
?It's horrible.
?I'm trying
the Third Wave Water.
?Third Wave Water.
So one packet mixed
into a gallon of water.
It's smoother.
I must admit,
this is better.
It's less acrid.
It has a longer finish...
It's smoother.
...for sure.
It's smoother,
and is it acidity?
?Correct.
?Is it affecting the acidity?
?Yes.
?Tell us what's in the powder.
Minor: Well, let me give you
a little background on myself.
So I joined ??
?We don't care.
We just care
about the powder.
You need to hear
about me first.
The magic powder, man.
So, I joined the Marine Corps
right out of high school,
spent a year in Iraq
as a machine?gunner.
In 2004, came back, got married,
started a coffee shop.
?Thank you for your service.
?Thank you.
?Yes, absolutely.
?Started a coffee shop.
My customers would always
ruin the coffee
that I'm giving them
with their tap water.
And I kept trying
to figure out a way
to make perfect brewing water.
Now, I know as a winemaker,
distilled water tastes terrible.
?Absolutely.
?Yes.
It's not that easy to get
anymore, pure distilled water.
But what happens if
I just use tap water?
It's not gonna do it.
You can't.
The problem is, tap water,
from city to city...
Too much iron in it, right?
Well, it's gonna have ??
who knows what's in it.
It depends on the rainfall,
it depends on what
stone is underneath.
Wait, but let's go back,
'cause I'm confused about this,
for a minute.
I'm confused, too.
So in the stores,
they sell all types of water ??
spring water,
distilled water.
What you're saying is
that you need to take
one of these packets,
put it into distilled water,
then put that
into your coffee maker.
Yes.
Guys, talk us
through the numbers.
We've been in business
for eight months,
and we have over 1,200 customers
shipped to over 50 countries.
?What are your total sales?
?Sales?
We've done
$66,000 this year.
We did $4,000 last year.
Around the world?
?Around the world.
?Around the world.
How much do you think you'll do
for the entire year?
$120,000
is our estimate.
You know, at first I thought
that this was, like, your little
pack that you would
just pour into your...
Yeah, me too.
...individual coffee,
and I thought, "Oh, well, if it
makes my coffee taste better,
and it's minerals,
which is healthy,
then that might be
a great thing."
But the complication of it,
that I have to pour this
into only distilled water,
makes a really complicated
solution to something that
isn't that big of a problem.
And so unfortunately,
for that reason, I'm out.
Thank you for your
consideration.
I'm with Lori.
I thought you had something
that I could conveniently
put in my cup in the morning
to enhance the experience.
The coffee tastes great.
But fancy for me is when I use
bottled water in my coffee.
It's not for me.
Appreciate the cup.
I'm out.
Guys, I ??
this is...a hard sale.
O'Leary: But there is
a market for it.
The question is,
how big is that market,
and how expensive
is it to access it?
Because I have to admit,
this is amazing coffee.
I mean, compared to what the
street water tasted versus this.
I've been buying wine
as an investor for decades.
Why does everything
come back to wine?
Well, you got to hear this out.
You'll learn something, Barbara.
It's so boring.
Listen, grasshopper.
I never learn
anything from you.
I'm gonna bring
it home for you.
I've not learned
a single thing from you.
I just want you to know.
You're gonna learn
something very important.
You're gonna learn
how to listen...
Get on with it, get out.
...from the master, all right?
Better have some coffee
to stay awake for this.
And then I started
doing the research,
and here's what I learned.
I thought I could bring wine
out at $60, $80, $90 a bottle,
have no trouble
getting market share.
When I went to the retailers,
they told me that 97%
of wine sold in America
is sold for under $12 a bottle.
That is 97% of the market.
So I think where you fit ??
you're in that 3% niche
of people that are willing
to pay and go through the hassle
of making this perfect
cup of coffee.
It's very difficult to make it
a mass?based product.
I cannot figure out here how...
So I'll throw this out
for you to think about.
...I go from $66,000 in sales,
or even $120,000,
and ever get my $100,000 back.
I mean, that's the problem.
Guys, I'm sorry.
I'm out.
Thank you,
Mr. Wonderful.
One of the great aspects
is our gross margins are 95%.
So we send these packs
for free to people
so we can get it
in their home.
Cuban: No one's questioning
whether it can work.
You've proved it.
It tastes better.
Yes. The problem is,
how much work,
how much hassle factor
is required to get there.
Anything that can enhance
the coffee market
has a great opportunity,
but it's so niche.
Sorry, guys.
For those reasons, I'm out.
?We appreciate it, Mark.
?Thank you.
Herjavec: Charles,
you still got Barbara.
You know, sadly for me,
there's a lot I see wrong here.
I think buying a gallon
of distilled water
and carrying it home, that's
asking a lot of a consumer.
It's a royal pain in the ass.
And if I was using
my left brain and my logic,
I would just be out right away.
But there's something
about you guys I really like.
I think you're
straight shooters.
This coffee tasted
twice as good as the other cup.
I mean, everybody here
responded the same way.
True.
I'll offer you $100,000
for 33.33%.
[ Lori groans ]
Plus, I want $1 per box sold
until I recoup my $100,000.
It's aggressive. I have to
admit, it's very aggressive.
You can counter.
That dollar is a royalty,
Barbara.
Excuse me, would you just
be quiet for a while?
It's a royalty.
Call it what you want.
Nasty.
Barbara, I want to know
what you think that you can do
specifically that's gonna
help our company.
I'm gonna know
how to market it.
You're gonna get
tons of repeat orders.
But I think your
marketplace is online.
And I can help you there because
I sell so much product online.
Minor: Not only did we get
great advice from some of
the best business people
in America,
but we got a deal
with one of the Sharks,
and we are super happy.
