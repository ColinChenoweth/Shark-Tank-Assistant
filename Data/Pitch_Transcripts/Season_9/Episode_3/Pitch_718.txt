So discreet you didn't realize
I've had one in my hand
this entire time.
And amazingly, our products
aren't just for A.D.D.ers.
They're also used to help with
diagnosed disorders like autism,
Asperger's, Tourette's,
as well as non?diagnosed,
like stress and anxiety.
And, Sharks,
our fidgets really work.
There's a huge market
out there for our products,
but we need our help
to put our fidgets
into the hands of millions
of people around the world.
So who wants
to help the Fidget Man
make Fidgetland
a household brand?
I have some samples.
Let me pass them out so you guys
can get fidgeting.
?Okay.
?Okay.
He didn't look so fidgety to me.
Did he to you?
?He didn't look very fidgety.
?That's 'cause he's got
the fidget device.
?That's right.
?There you go.
?Thank you, Fidget Man.
?Absolutely. For you.
?Thank you.
?Thank you, Fidget Man.
?Fidget Man from Fidgetland.
Can we just rip
this out of here?
Martin: [ Whispering ]
You are creative,
you are unique,
you are awesome.
You are creative,
you are awesome.
Narrator: Next up is a mom with
a solution to a hairy problem.
I'm Liz Martin
from Battle Ground, Washington,
and I am here today asking
for $75,000 in exchange for
35% of my company.
Sharks, every day,
parents are put face?to?face
with an exhausting and seemingly
impossible challenge.
Wow.
[ Laughs ]
Wait.
Hair.
Getting a small child
to sit still long enough
to brush their hair
is one of humanity's
most vexing challenges.
[ Laughs ]
I'm a mother of three girls,
so I know...
brushtration is real!
And as I searched
for a solution,
I was only met
with more...
medieval torture devices
that sent my kiddos running.
Finally, I found a solution.
It was in my daughter's bedroom,
staring right back at me.
I present to you...
the TanglePets!
[ Laughter ]
It's a high?quality
hairbrush placed inside
a ridiculously adorable
plush character,
making kids love it,
parents need it.
So, Sharks, who is ready
to get fierce on tangles
while staying
friendly with kids?
I have samples!
[ Laughter ]
Blue lion for you, Mark.
Thank you.
?What did you get, Mark?
?I got a blue lion.
?Ladybug for you, Lori.
?Thank you.
?What did you get, Lori?
?Ladybug.
?Turtle for you, Kevin.
?Thank you so much.
?Nice to meet you.
?A turtle for Kevin.
?Barb.
?Thank you very much.
?Sassy kitty.
?Aww.
?Aww.
?And a puppy.
?Aww! Thank you!
?So, tell us about
your background first.
So I've always been
a salesperson,
and I've always loved
finding good products and then,
you know, getting people
to buy them.
When I became a mom,
my focus shifted obviously.
My kids were playing
in their room one day,
but as I walked in, I saw
all these toys on the ground.
I literally went in, like,
snuck a toy,
very disturbingly shoved
a brush in it,
and then like, I'm like,
around the corner
like [high?pitched voice]
"Hey, everybody,
who wants to brush their hair?"
And like, game?changer
at that point. No joke.
But this is
an ordinary brush
with a hippopotamus
attached to it.
I would not say ordinary,
because I will tell you,
I spent ??
No, but is it because it's
a hippo that the kids like
the fact that it's a toy?
Because it's a brush.
No, no, no. Let me explain
something about brushes.
What do you mean, "No, no, no."
I'm looking. That's a brush.
I get that you're looking at
it ?? you're not feeling it,
and you don't have hair
to brush it with.
?Ohh!
?Ohh!
?Ka?boom!
?No, that's not ??
that's a good thing!
?Excuse me...
?I love people without hair!
?Excuse me...
?Are you kidding me?
?Whoa!
Trust me, there is
so much hair on his back,
he'll put this to use.
?Ohh!
?It's true though. It's true.
What I really want to know,
is this any different
than any other brush
I can buy for 5 cents?
It absolutely is.
You are sassy.
I like it.
No, stay on the brush.
You're telling me there's
nothing like this?
Do you have
a patent on it?
?Provisional utility patent.
?You've got to be kidding.
No, that particular
brush is unique?
What, you're saying
this brush is patentable?
This specific brush
says that it's meant
for all hair types,
and it is.
Do you make this brush?
Or you borrowed this brush
and put the animal on top?
No, no, no.
I have it made in China.
What does it cost?
So it's $2.60 landed.
I wholesale for $5,
and it retails for $12.
Okay, that's great.
I've made almost $8,000.
Whoa!
$8,000!
Maybe she's only been
selling for a short time.
?How long have you been selling?
?How many years?
So I ?? no, I had
the idea last year.
I got my first shipment
in November.
What happened was ?? here's what
you got to understand about me.
?So ??
?Listen, if this keeps
going this way, you're gonna
make hundreds of dollars here.
I know!
Let me explain.
My husband got diagnosed
with a brain disease last year.
And so I have to be honest
with you ?? I knew
this was gonna be big,
but I also knew I had
to take care of my husband and I
had to take care of my kids.
And that's why
the sales are $8,000.
And I'm not making excuses,
but that was my focus.
I promise you when
sales are the focus ??
My focus is now that. My husband
is healthy, things are good.
So what are you gonna
sell this year?
You've done $8,000
since the beginning.
$100,000 easily.
The incredible
thing about my product is,
it's not a chachki
because it's functional.
It's something you have
to buy for your children.
And it's ??
Liz, do you ever turn off?
I ?? at night.
When I go to bed.
[ Laughter ]
?I love that.
?Or during a movie.
Liz, look. What you've been able
to accomplish is incredible.
You're a force of nature.
But you drive me crazy.
For that reason, I'm out.
[ Sighs ]
I respect you so much.
Thank you for listening.
Thank you.
Liz, I don't know if I see it
in a hairbrush aisle.
I'm not saying you
can't get there.
Yeah.
Keep going.
But not for me
for right now. I'm out.
Okay. I appreciate that, Robert.
And thanks.
I don't see the merit
in this, okay?
I think you're
an interesting person,
you have a lot of energy.
But a year from now,
this is still gonna be
a rhino brush that nobody owns.
It's not even a rhino,
it's a fish.
I disagree with you.
I actually think that every
kid's hairbrush will
look like this in a year.
But I'm not as optimistic
as you on that topic.
Well, he's
so follicly challenged.
[ Laughs ]
And I'm out.
Thank you.
Okay. If you were
to say to me "Buy this.
This is the greatest,"
I would have to buy it
just because I couldn't
turn you away
because of your wild?ass
enthusiasm.
But the other side
of the wildly enthusiastic is,
you are extremely exhausting.
[ Chuckles ] Yep.
No, and that's
not a bad thing.
But I don't think
anybody's gonna work
the long?distance
run with you.
So for that reason,
I reluctantly say I'm out.
Barb, I have to just tell you ??
I know when to turn it off.
You guys are seeing
how many pitches?
I've got to sell to you.
I have a very ??
and I don't have numbers.
I don't have numbers
to sell you.
And good for you.
Good for you for recognizing
that and going for it.
So I have to.
Is your husband
exhausted all the time?
No.
Just asking.
He likes me a lot.
I bet he does.
Liz, get focused on the one
Shark that's still in the deal.
I give you, Lori Hairbrush.
?Hi.
?Listen, Liz.
I will tell you something
about this brush
that's interesting that I didn't
learn until a year ago.
This is what you call
a wet/dry brush.
The best brush in the world to
brush through any kind of hair.
And it goes right through,
and it doesn't rip it out,
and it doesn't hurt it.
How you got to that,
not being an inventor,
something I didn't know
600 products later,
is amazing to me.
And this is great?quality plush.
So you have taken
a beautiful plush toy,
put it into the smartest,
best?working brush there is.
I love the name.
That's adorable.
You have like
the perfect pie here.
So I'm going
to give you an offer.
Lori is Liz's last chance
for a deal
for her children's hairbrush,
TanglePets.
My offer is going to be
aggressive because
you're brand?new.
I know I'm going
to have to do a lot.
So I'll give you the $75,000.
We'll be 50/50 partners.
?Wow.
?I'll get this into
Buy Buy Baby, QVC.
I, uh, I can't explain how much
of an inspiration you are.
And I know that you're
the perfect partner.
I knew that
walking in here.
But I'm wondering if you'd
at all be willing to go 45%.
I've done this before.
Tremendous amount of work
on my part.
But I'm willing
to give you a hand,
help make a dream come true.
I think I'm the best shot
you've got ever in the world.
I always say ??
I make millionaires.
That's what I do.
Okay, that's what
I wanted to hear!
Lori, you have a deal!
Yay!
And now
I'm turning it back on!
[ Laughter ]
Wow.
Super smart, super good.
You're awesome.
Thank you. Thank you.
You're awesome!
You're awesome!
You're Lori!
You're awesome!
You all are missing out!
Congrats, Liz.
[ Screams, laughs ]
[ Sobs ]
[ Exhales deeply ]
?How'd it go?
?I got a deal with Lori!
?Yes!
?[ Laughs ]
?Yeah, I knew it!
?[ Screams ]
Oh, my God!
