My name is Makenzie Marzluff,
and I'm from Los Angeles.
I'm seeking $600,000 in exchange
for 12% of my company,
Delighted By.
Nearly everyone has
a sweet tooth, right?
When you go
to the grocery store,
you walk down aisles
of tempting treats.
It's nearly impossible
to walk out
without giving in.
Well, what if I told you,
you can now treat yourself
guilt?free?
Insert Delighted By ??
home of the original
dessert hummus.
[ Greiner laughs ]
O'Leary:
Dessert hummus?
You heard me right ??
dessert hummus.
It's a dip,
still made from chickpeas,
but just in sweet flavors.
To be honest,
it tastes less like hummus
and more like cookie dough,
but healthy,
and we're always 100% vegan,
gluten?free, non?GMO,
with less than 5 grams of sugar
per serving.
I know that first?timers
may be skeptical,
but the proof is in the taste,
which is why we need your help.
So, Sharks,
who's ready to dip in
and be delighted
by a sweet deal.
?Totally.
?Bring it on.
?Bring it on.
?Let's have it.
?[ Chuckles ]
Thank you, Makenzie.
You are welcome.
That's great.
Marzluff: So, let me tell you
what you're tasting.
You have our brownie?batter
hummus on a pretzel,
then you have our
snickerdoodle hummus an apple.
Wow, weird.
Next is vanilla bean hummus
served on a graham cracker,
then you have
our choc?o?mint hummus
as a healthy frosting
on a cupcake.
Oh, my goodness.
This [bleep] is good.
Thank you.
[ Laughter ]
And then you have
our chocolate?chip hummus
served on a spoon,
proving that you can have your
cookie dough and eat it, too.
Mmm.
It really is a healthy
alternative to a dessert.
Makenzie, how'd you come up
with the idea?
So, my background's
in nutrition and culinary.
I was going to
a Super Bowl party,
and I just wanted to create
a cookie dough dip
that was healthy.
So, I thought, why not put
chickpeas in the blender?
And when I brought it
to the party,
everyone literally thought
it was cookie dough.
I said, "No, no, no.
It's hummus."
It's still the same amount
of chickpeas.
I have to admit,
it's damn good.
Yeah.
?I mean, it's really good.
?Thank you.
?It is delicious.
?Thank you so much.
You have a very big price
on the business.
You must have
enormous sales.
You know, we launched
to shelves 13 months ago,
and we actually just hit
our million?dollar mark
in gross sales.
?What?!
?Wow!
?Wow!
?Good for you!
Because you're going
into the refrigerated sector,
which is very hard
to get into.
It is.
You're kicking somebody else
out to get that space.
Yeah, so, we're in
1,200 stores right now.
I rented a van,
and I drove up and down
seven states in the east coast
to all 88 Wegmans stores.
By yourself?
Twice ?? by myself.
I was literally sleeping
on coolers of hummus.
You're a beast,
Makenzie.
?That's crazy.
?That's really crazy.
Marzluff: So, what I hear
from the buyers is,
"You are the only person
innovating in this category."
Yes.
I've been told over
and over again
this is the only innovative
thing in the category itself.
Are you sold side?by?side
to other hummusses?
Yes, right now,
we're merchandising
next to regular hummus.
The problem is you're not
a competitor to hummus.
Rodriguez: Makenzie,
how much money have you invested
to get this business
started?
Personally,
around 20 grand,
and we've raised to?date 400k
from friends and family.
At what valuation
did you raise that at?
The last round was
4 million.
What do you think
it's gonna look like in revenue
this year?
I'm projecting
$1.5 million in sales.
?Okay.
?That's conservative.
You value the business
at $5 million.
You're asking me
to pay 33 times
the potential of what
you could make this year.
There are other players that
have co?packers in hummus
that could emulate
what you're doing
that already have distribution
in a much wider basis.
Okay, let's look
at all the big guys
that are purchasing
hummus companies.
Okay.
So, we've got Pepsi.
But you're not
a hummus company.
But we're taking
their shelf space.
Rodriguez: Makenzie,
in a business like this,
I would love to pay
five to eight times EBITDA,
or net earnings,
okay?
You're coming here,
and you're asking for almost,
like Kevin said,
north of 30 times.
So, for that reason,
I'm out.
Okay.
Look, you've been successful
in raising at $4 million,
it's friends and family.
Now you're in front
of real investors.
Are you going to have
any flexibility on valuation?
No.
Rodriguez: Makenzie,
all due respect,
I just want you to keep in mind
as you move forward,
not every capital
is the same.
There is some capital
called smart capital,
and you're not gonna find
smarter capital
than these Sharks.
That's why I feel like
I'm giving a fair valuation,
because I know that
what this category ??
no, the industry requires.
What do you feel like
you're missing?
In terms of a team?
Yeah, just to get
to where you want to go?
Like, if you look at what
I'm projecting in terms
of what I want to use
this capital for,
we're looking at some
operations support.
What my ?? I have brokers
in the midwest.
They'll tell me, you know,
if you had a VP of sales,
that would be really helpful,
because they can direct
you strategically.
Would you use this
to hire one?
Yes.
But you've hired
no one yet.
Look, we're 13 months in.
Like, I'm ready to build a team.
I'm here.
Like, I need some help
with building that team.
You don't have even
a beginning team
of people
to support you.
I did hire an intern,
but it just wasn't perfect
in terms of excellence.
You know what I learned
about delegating,
and I learned it
very young?
80% is good enough.
I think you're gonna
have a hard time
multiplying yourself
hiring people,
knitting them into a team,
and building relationships.
I don't hear any indication
that that's your forte.
I'm gonna trust my instinct.
I'm out.
Thank you.
It's a fabulous
product.
The problem is,
is the money burnt.
You actually have to have
a very big, wide distribution,
but at the same time,
it requires a ton of money.
I'm out.
Cuban: How open
to change are you?
Because when I look
at this,
I think the hardest
possible place to sell it
is in grocery stores,
because you have to sample it
to get people ??
for someone to say,
"Wow, this is amazing."
Have you looked at retail
at all, opening up a store?
I've thought about it.
Of what, Mark?
Mark, you're thinking like
an ice cream store?
Yes.
I think
that's a crazy idea.
Exactly, thank you.
The ones that have made me
the most money
have always been
the craziest.
Okay, you and I would
never agree on this valuation.
I'm not gonna fight with you
about that.
I'll loan you
the $600,000...
at 11%,
and I'll take 6% of the business
for doing that.
Makenzie, the thing for me is,
I always look for things
that are healthy, taste good,
that are gluten?free,
but the equity is
an issue.
In order for me to do it,
it would have to be
a 600k for 25%.
How 'bout those
chickpeas?
Makenzie, basically,
he cut your valuation in half.
I want to move up
your balance sheet.
I want to be a lender.
Mark is willing to be
an equity investor,
but he wants 25%
of the company.
I'm willing to do both,
once we hit our benchmarks ??
That's the difference.
And so, when, you said,
we meet those benchmarks...
Right, then cash
will be available.
?Cash will be available?
?Yeah.
I don't mind le??
I do it with all my companies.
Do you believe that we can
build it to, like,
$80 million valuation?
?Yes.
Makenzie, this is not
supposed to be easy.
You've got to decide.
Okay.
It's a simple decision.
Do you want to sell 25%
of your company?
Don't force her.
The challenge in this is,
you have a genius product,
but you don't have
a company yet, right?
Yeah.
And, so,
it's gonna take all that.
So, you're saying,
you're gonna help with that?
Yes, all of it.
Soup to nuts.
Everything ??
I've done it before.
?Okay, you have a deal.
?Thank you.
?Oh! Good one!
?Whoo!
?Good decision.
?Congrats.
Thank you so much.
We'll make this work.
Thank you.
Congrats, Makenzie.
Marzluff: My vision is
that in four years' time,
someone's at your house,
and you offer them hummus,
and they say,
"Oh, is it sweet or savory?"
We're actually creating
a new category,
and I believe that, with Mark,
we can do that.
I'm telling you ?? we open up
a little retail store...
The reason why
I like it, Mark,
is because you're just probably
need 600 square?feet.
More than that.
That's a bad idea.
No, listen to me.
Listen to me.
You go, and you take
a busy thoroughfare ??
"Honey, let's not have
ice cream ??
let's go and have
a little bit of hummus
at that other place."
Yeah, you watch.
You watch.
