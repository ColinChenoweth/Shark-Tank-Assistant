Hi, Sharks.
My name is Ehan Kamat.
And I'm his dad,
Vinay Kamat.
We're from St. Louis,
Missouri,
and our product
is the Solemender.
We're seeking $75,000 in
exchange for 10% of our company.
Now, Sharks,
as a teenager,
I know a thing or two
about foot pain.
You see, I get up at 5:00 a. m.
for school,
and after a long day
of AP classes,
I shoot over
to the robotics lab,
after which I come home to tend
to my hydroponic garden.
So after all this,
my dogs are barking.
I think all you guys
can relate.
After a long day at work,
we need something portable
that can give us
quick foot relief.
So, I invented
the Solemender ??
an innovative new
treatment solution
to help alleviate
foot pain.
Now, Ms. Corcoran,
when you were first
starting out as a waitress,
I would imagine that you would
have experienced some foot pain.
Would you mind coming up
and giving the Solemender a try?
I would love it if I get
some kind of massage out of it.
Exactly, right?
Come on over.
Yeah, I'm coming.
We have a seat set up
for you right here.
Good.
And what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna pull the frozen roller
out of the freezer
real quick.
Nice.
So, we have this guy right here,
which is our frozen roller.
And we're gonna take this, and
we're gonna put it in the base.
Now, it's as simple as rolling
your foot on the Solemender.
And we recommend 10
to 15 minutes twice a day.
?Is it cold?
?You feel cold?
It's only cold,
it's, like, instantly,
my foot relaxed ??
It's shocking.
Yeah.
And what it's doing...
?Really?
?Wow.
?Ba?bam.
Wow,
I do feel refreshed.
It does.
It feels great, doesn't it?
Thank you for that.
Ehan: So, what the Solemender
is doing is,
it has
a stainless?steel roller
with a proprietary
gel pack inside.
What it's doing is,
it's combining cold
and massage therapy
into one easy?to?use device.
Now, Sharks, who's ready
to help us mend some soles?
Ehan: Actually, I have
some samples for you guys
if you want
to check them out.
So, they are cold
so you can try them out.
?Oh, they're cold. All right.
?Perfect.
?Terrific.
?They are frozen.
And then, there's a piece
of packaging right there
so you can check out
how that runs, as well.
Corcoran: Nice.
And then, Mr. Wonderful.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Ehan.
Thank you.
Ehan: So, what it's gonna do is,
it's gonna reduce inflammation
and it's also gonna help
repair micro?tears
in the tendons that run along
the bottom of your foot.
?How old are you?
?I'm 17.
?Wow.
?Wow!
Plantar fasciitis ??
I see that's right on the box.
Ehan: Yes.
Can you explain what this is,
and why this helps it?
So, what plantar fasciitis is,
is where you get micro tears
in the tendons that run along
the bottom of your foot,
and, unfortunately,
2 million people per year
get this condition,
and my mom was one
of those 2 million people.
I hated seeing her in pain,
so I figured
there's got to be
a way to help her out.
And it turns out that doctors
recommend freezing
a water bottle
and rolling your foot on it,
but if you've ever
frozen a water bottle,
you know it has the tendency
to explode every once
in a while.
So, I figured there's got
to be a better way
to help people alleviate
their foot pain,
but also be simple
and easy to use.
So I came up
with the Solemender,
and what happened was,
my dad,
and he is a little bit
of an expert
compared to me
on plantar fasciitis.
Why is Dad an expert?
So, I'm an internal
medicine physician,
been doing it
for about 20 years.
His mom, my wife,
is a rheumatologist,
and she does arthritis,
musculoskeletal disease,
and so forth.
So, he came up to us
with this idea, and we said,
"Uh, it sounds great.
But it's got to have been done."
Wasn't done.
We use marbles.
The Mavs use marbles.
Right.
So, people use marbles,
people use coffee cans,
people use golf balls.
I think I have
your first client.
I play with a guy
named Ichiro
who's gonna go straight
into the Hall of Fame,
and every day
for about an hour,
he would sit there in front
of his locker and do this...
for 45 minutes.
On what?
And then he went out
and got four hits every night.
Wait, what was he
doing that on?
What on ??
on a device like this?
He used, like,
a little golf ball.
Oh, I was wondering.
What are your sales?
So, we've done $25,000
in just under a year,
and it's been a lot of me
going door?to?door,
talking to all these
different people.
We've been very fortunate
that 11 stores were
really, really excited
about the Solemender,
really excited about young
entrepreneurs and all that.
Have they re?ordered
them from you?
Yes.
Yes, so we will get
a re?order depending
on how sales are in the season
every one to two weeks.
And what are you selling
them for? I don't think
you gave us a price.
Yeah, so, they're sold
for $39.99.
Wow, that's pricey.
O'Leary: What do they
cost to make?
Right now, landed cost
is just under $10,
but if we can get
25,000 units,
we can get it down
to $6.80 landed here.
The biggest challenge
for this deal to me is,
how do I find the people
that have the highest propensity
to buy it...
Yeah.
...to get my
customer?acquisition cost down,
because not everybody
wants this or needs it,
but the people that do need it
really want it.
Right.
So, 2 million people
have plantar fasciitis.
?2 million.
?2 million?
?Per year.
Wait, I want to talk
about you a little bit,
because I don't want
to bury the headline.
I mean, the fact
that you're 17 years old.
When I was a 10?year?old boy,
I had two dreams.
I wanted to be
a Major League Baseball player,
and I wanted to be a CEO
of a major company.
What is it that you want
to do when you grow up?
So, I'll just real quick
start out with ??
this moment right here
has been one of the greatest
moments of my life.
Honestly, I've watched
"Shark Tank"
since I was 8 years old ??
Not yet, Ehan.
[ Laughter ]
Very true, very true.
What grade are you in?
I'm going into
senior year.
Where are you going
to school for college?
You know,
I'm not sure yet.
If I can get the Solemender
to where I need it to be,
I'm 100% committed
to the Solemender.
?No, bad idea. Bad idea.
?Whoa, whoa. Whoa!
Ehan, that's a bad idea,
and I'm gonna tell you why.
Learning accounting,
learning finance,
learning marketing ??
the more you can
pull together,
the quicker you can
make decisions,
the more competitive you can be,
the greater the advantage.
O'Leary: There is the dilemma.
Who's gonna be
running Solemender?
You can run this
off the net,
and you're smart enough
to hire somebody to
go to all the doctor's offices
and grow it from there.
Learn!
Learn, learn, learn.
The greatest competitive
advantage is knowledge.
Rodriguez:
Ehan, you know what?
We used to say the only way
out of the hood
is to hit home runs
or get an education.
I want to get down
to the core issue.
What do you know
that could help any Shark
help you
acquire those customers?
So, I give you $75,000.
Task 1 is get me
2 million suffering.
So, if we get into
a retail store,
what do people do
when they have foot pain?
They run into their pharmacy
and they say,
"I don't want to go
to the doctor."
Yeah, but it's in retail
stores already, right?
I just want to sell it online.
All right.
Yeah.
But what are you
doing online, Ehan?
So, we do have
our online website.
Customer acquisition online
is the whole deal.
I got it.
That's what's missing
in this presentation.
And so, I don't know
that answer.
For me, it's an unknown.
That's what was missing,
and for that reason,
I'm out.
Corcoran: Okay, Ehan,
I think you as a presenter
are phenomenal.
I think your product itself
lacks sex appeal.
It just doesn't
hook me in.
I love you,
but I'm out.
Okay, thank you.
I think that you will
go really far.
For me, this isn't
the right product for me.
[ Quietly ] No, don't go!
So, I'm sorry.
I'm out.
Ehan: Mark said that knowledge
is the competitive advantage,
and I think that's
fantastic advice.
I'm gonna pursue
moving into college.
You know, I'm only 17,
but this has been one
of the greatest
experiences for me,
and, you know, I have a lot
of advice to move forward now.
