My name is Robbie Cabral.
I'm the inventor, CEO,
and founder of BenjiLock.
I come to the Tank
extremely humble,
seeking $200,000
for 10% of my company.
Sharks, I go to the gym
every day.
Try to keep myself in shape,
but also release
that grind and stress.
Ironically,
I noticed that stress
was actually lurking
in the locker rooms.
People actually knocking
on their locker doors
because they left
their keys inside,
others actually forgot
their combinations.
They were stressed out,
and that's why I created
BenjiLock.
BenjiLock is the world's first
traditional padlock
with fingerprint technology,.
Wow.
...which means that not
only you can open it
with the ease of
your fingertips...
[ Whirring ]
Wow.
But also...
Clever.
...with a set
of traditional keys.
So, if the technology fails,
you're still able
to use your lock.
Now, Sharks, who wants
to lock up this deal
and invest in BenjiLock?
[ Chuckles ]
What I'm gonna show you
right now,
it's the evolution of BenjiLock,
which is, uh,
it's a dummy version.
Greiner: So, is this
a prototype?
Yes, right now,
it's a prototype.
I'm working on
a smaller version, as well.
O'Leary: How long
will it hold a charge
before I have
to use the key?
You charge it
for 30 minutes,
and it lasts you
a whole year.
A year?
A year with one,
single charge.
Wow.
With God's faith,
I just got the patent granted.
?Wow.
?Great, congrats.
I see you won
the CES Award.
You won the Innovation Award
for 2017.
Yes.
Well, the Consumer
Electronics Show
is full of people
and innovators displaying
the newest technology
and innovation.
Everybody comes
from all over the world
to go to it to see
what's the latest greatest.
So, it's very impressive to me
that you won that,
so that speaks
volumes.
Can it also be
used as a patent
to replace
the core?cylinder lock
in the standard
domestic door?lock?
Yep, yep.
Okay, Robbie.
I'm imagining that when people
saw this innovation ??
particularly large,
lock manufacturers ??
did they approach you
and say,
"Robbie, I'd like to
license your technology"?
There's one right now
that's just waiting
for me to take action.
How much is it gonna
cost to make it,
and what's it gonna cost
at retail?
I did a survey in L. A.
with 1,041 people
with just the prototype,
and I told them,
"Are you willing to buy this?"
if it's on the shelf,
and they all say ?? 99.
9 say "yes."
They haven't see??
Did you read my book?
I...
[ Chuckles ]
I was gonna say,
"That's what I say to do."
Good job.
They told me that
they're willing to pay
$60 or more for the lock.
And what can you
make it for?
I can get this lock
at $20.
At what quantity were
you quoted?
At 50,000 units.
50,000 units.
50,000 at $20.
50,000 units because
I have Sam's Club interested
in 30,000 units
for Q1 of 2018.
Corcoran: Robbie, where did you
get the money to start this?
It must be expensive
to do a prototype.
Yeah, I mean,
I did it all on my own ??
self?funded.
How much money
did you put into it?
Right now...
I've invested $87,000.
?Wow.
Cuban: People always think
they have to go raise money,
borrow money,
but the one thing in life
you can control
is your effort.
Yeah.
Is this your full?time gig,
Robbie?
This is my full?time job.
I've been working on this
since I got laid off from work,
so I guess this own work.
My wife is a teacher.
I got three kids.
I was born and raised
in Dominican Republic.
Nuh?uh!
I came in 2007.
So I'm gonna tell you,
my friends, dude,
I mean...
it's been a long journey.
My background
is marketing/advertising,
and when I actually tried to
"make the American Dream"
and had a good job
in the real estate world,
six months into it,
I got laid off.
And the day they laid me off,
my daughter was born.
Wow.
[ Voice breaking ] So, now,
you know, you're unemployed.
You thought that
you came to America
to make the American Dream.
I got laid off,
I said, "Man,
I'm just gonna try to push it
for my family, for my friends."
[ Sniffles ]
[ Sniffles ]
It's just that...
a lot of people never
believe in you, man.
A lot of people
said to me, like,
"Oh, you're not
gonna make it."
But, all of a sudden,
I had something great.
And now I'm here, man.
For me, this is
the American Dream already.
O'Leary: I'm trying
to figure out if you want to go
the partnership route
with a giant,
global distributor.
Because if you want to do that,
I'm your guy.
I'm a beast
on licensing deals.
And so I'll make you
an offer.
is forcing your partner
to deliver.
Robbie, I see
your brows furrowing
like you're getting worried
like you're listening to him.
Don't listen to him.
That is just ridiculous.
Listen, that's an offer.
It's ridiculous.
If you want to go
that direction,
then you'll have cash
flow every quarter.
Every 90 days,
you'll get a check
to do other things with.
I mean, it's an interesting
path of the licensing,
'cause I know that
through that invention,
there's other things
that I can create.
I don't see the vision
the same as Kevin, okay?
I see the vision is that
you don't have to make a choice
between licensing and retail
and manufacturing.
If you want to go into retail,
I'll go there with you, too.
But I think you want
to pursue both paths,
because you're a year
and a half, two years away
from actually
delivering this product.
?You know what, Robbie ??
?Robbie.
Wait, I'm gonna give you
an offer, okay?
So, I'm going to offer you
the $200,000 for 15%.
?Same as Kevin.
?Identical deal.
?Okay, Robbie.
You know what I think you need
more than a partner?
I think you need a team.
So I'm going to give you
one?half of the $200,000
for 10% of the business,
but you're gonna have
to get another Shark
to join me on that.
'Cause I think you really need
your own little board
of directors
that helps you
along the way,
and I don't think
Kevin's kind of a deal
is really
what you want.
Creative people don't want
those kind of deals.
They want to birth
their baby
and they want to
bring it to fruition
and get the satisfaction
of seeing it grow up.
That's just the way it is.
Lori and I both gave him
a better offer than you.
First of all,
let me just tell you,
as someone who both of
his parents are Dominican,
I lived in Dominican
from age 5 to about 9.
And I just love your passion.
I love what you're doing.
And I cannot tell you
how proud I am.
Everything that you've done
resonates with me.
It's just
an amazing story.
So, you had me at hello.
[ Sniffles ]
Ah!
No, no.
Corcoran: Me gusta mucho.
He asked 20%
for with Barbara,
because I can speak
Spanish, too.
[ Cuban and Rodriguez laugh ]
So, so ?? wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Bonjour, mes amis.
[ Chuckles ]
I can speak French.
Okay, I'm gonna
stop in Spanish.
So...
Robbie, look.
I think what you've been able
to accomplish is phenomenal.
You're a grinder,
you're heart, you're passion,
but I'm not the right person
to just go out and license this,
'cause it's tech,
but it's not really tech,
and so for those reason,
I'm out.
Robbie. Lori ??
There's no question.
She's the best of the best
at what she does.
She has QVC,
and she's phenomenal.
No, don't say "QVC."
Lori, please stop groveling.
I'm all over retail,
I'm all over TV.
Here's what we have.
And I'm all over
the Internet.
I speak your
native language,
I understand you better than
any other Shark here.
Robbie, you've got
to make a decision.
I see your pain, but you've
got to make a decision.
This is not a bad problem
you're having.
This is a good day
you're having.
No, it's a good problem.
It's a good problem
to have right now.
Oh, Lord Jesus.
Santo Dios.
[ Chuckles ]
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.
You've got three amazing offers,
and now it's your time.
What do you want to do?
Robbie has three offers
on the table
for his biometric padlock,
BenjiLock.
Kevin and Lori have both offered
$200,000 for 15%,
and Barbara and Alex together
have offered $200,000 for 20%.
What do you want to do?
Let's do this, Robbie.
No, Robbie.
Let's do this.
Stop whining ??
both of you.
My gut is telling me
a lot of things right now.
This is very difficult
to choose.
I mean, all of you guys
are great,
I mean, holy smokes.
Oh, Lord Jesus,
santo Dios.
[ Groans ]
Gosh, I love all of you,
but for some reason,
my heart is telling me
to go with Mr. Wonderful.
What?!
Wow!
What?!
[ Laughs ]
Oh, my God!
Yeah, you go, Robbie!
Shock of the century.
I didn't think
he had a shot.
You are money.
I'm gonna make you rich.
Watch it happen.
Watch it happen.
You got it, man.
I want to meet your wife, too.
Fantastic.
Thanks a lot.
[ Speaking Spanish ]
I'm so proud of you.
Felicidades.
Well, I'll eat my hat.
My God.
Thank you.
Gracias, gracias.
I went with Kevin because
I feel that he's a strong beast
at negotiating licensing,
and I felt like all
of their offers were great.
But just for some reason I felt
the fire that I saw in Kevin,
for some reason,
something connected there.
I know I made
the right decision.
Instinct that leads to you?
I don't get it.
Kevin, if he doesn't
blow up,
I'm gonna come find you
in Canada.
[ Both laugh ]
"Boom" goes the dynamite.
