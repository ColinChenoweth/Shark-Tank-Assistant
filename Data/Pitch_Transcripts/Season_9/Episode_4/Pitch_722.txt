My name is Chris,
I'm from Dallas, Texas...
Yeah!
...and my company is Ice Shaker.
I'm here seeking $100,000
for 10% ownership in my company.
Sharks, as you can tell,
I work out.
Chris: Can we pass these out.
We had a good idea
that we were gonna win,
so we got you guys
a prize anyways.
Rob: Can I keep this one,
actually?
The classic,
stainless steel.
Here we go.
O'Leary: Tell us about
your million dollar
thermos bottle, here.
All right, so ??
Wait, before we get
too far ahead, guys.
For all those people
watching who don't know
the Gronkowski family ??
Super Bowl champs, right?
How many rings
do you guys have?
Well, I got two
Super Bowl Championships
with the
New England Patriots.
My brother, Glenn,
was with us this year, too.
Gord has a couple rings
playing baseball.
Yeah.
Unbelievable. Your parents
must be bursting with pride.
Greiner: Yeah.
It's really amazing.
Could you imagine.
You're worth feeding
all those years.
That's for sure.
[ Laughter ]
Okay, Chris, there's dozens
of these on the market.
So, there's nothing on the
market with the classic pop?top
that is insulated
in stainless steel.
There was other bottles out
there that were stainless steel,
but didn't have a vacuum seal,
and they weren't double?walled,
so when you touched them
or you put cold in it,
you would freeze
your hand.
Cuban: So, when did you start
the business side of it?
Have you started
to sell them?
Yes, In the first six months,
we've sold about $80,000 worth.
That's not bad.
And out of that $80,000,
$35,000 has been so far
this month and last month.
And where are you
selling them at?
So, right now, we're selling
them on our website,
We're selling them on Amazon.
We're in a few retail stores.
And we sell them
at fitness expos.
What's the retail price
of the bottle?
So, the bottle is $25.
What was the cost?
And your cost of making it?
Our cost to make them are
right around $5 landed.
Our margins are huge.
At retail, they're 80%.
Rodriguez: What
competitive advantage
do you feel like you have
over others?
I'm first?to?market
with it.
We already have
great reviews online.
The product's selling itself.
We put very little marketing
money into it at all.
Why is your name
not on it?
Uh, I wanted to build a product
that people wanted.
I didn't want it to be,
you know, every time
Rob posted it,
it sold and that was it.
I wanted make sure it was
something out there.
But couldn't you call it,
like, the Gronk?shaker?
?Right?
?Yeah, she's right.
I mean, everybody'd be like,
"Yes, that's the one."
To Lori's point, right,
whatever edge you can get,
you got to take.
It already sounds right,
doesn't it?
?Yeah.
?The Gronk Shaker?
Chris, what do you need
the $100,000 for?
So, I don't exactly
need the money.
If I needed just $100,000,
I could probably
call someone I know,
and he'd probably
give it to me.
But, uh...
I need the expertise.
I like it, 'cause
I'm a huge Gronk fan.
I love your family,
I love the team,
I'm from Boston,
it's cool.
But I want to make money ??
I'm a Shark.
Well, see, all right, look.
If you can bring
the "Gronk" into it,
I'll do the deal for 20%.
I'll give you 100k for 20%.
Rodriguez: Chris,
I love the back story.
You know, I own part of
a thousand gyms in 20 countries.
I understand athletes,
so when we see entrepreneurs
stand on that rug
and you're an athlete,
I feel like you're a guy coming
into the Yankee clubhouse,
and you're a guy that
I want in the foxhole with me.
'Cause I think you're
a championship player.
I am interested ??
Mark, if you're interested,
I think we can bring
a lot to this business.
Oh, no question.
Corcoran: No, no, no.
Well, I have an offer, too.
Well, is there an offer
or is it just talk?
Is 10% enough?
10% is not enough.
Right,
that's the challenge.
Chris, you've got
to start thinking
how much value
we can add.
Chris Gronkowski has
two offers on the table
for his insulated
protein shake bottle,
Ice Shaker.
Kevin has offered
$100,000 for 20%.
Mark and Alex have joined in
on an offer of $150,000 for 20%.
Chris, we don't like
to wait around.
So you got to tell us.
No, he's afraid of
the ladies sitting here.
You've got to tell us.
Corcoran: Frankly, guys,
I would give you
a million dollars for 10%.
Wow.
Just to hang out
with you guys.
[ Laughter ]
I don't care
what the deal is.
Okay, on a more
serious note,
definitely take
Lori's great idea
and change the name
immediately.
I think it should be
in big, capital, bold,
raised letters
that just says "Gronk."
Here's my offer ??
$100,000 for
10% of the business.
Nobody's smarter than me
at marketing,
and I've done it with already
seven of my top brands
that wouldn't be where they are
from "Shark Tank"
if not for
my marketing ability.
They're all big brands
in their space.
Listen, I haven't even gotten
to get out my offer yet.
I want to show you
my references.
A scroll
from the 1600s.
So, Scrub Daddy ??
$120 million.
Simply Fit ??
$150 million.
Sleep Styler ??
$75 million in four months.
I've taken
multiple companies
to multi?billion?dollar
valuations, all right?
My offer is ??
How many have you
done, Lori?
Oh!
[ Laughter ]
Whoa, whoa, whoa ??
I have taken people
to many, many, many millions
instantly.
Lori! What's the offer?
What's the offer?
Simply Fit Board
is a household name.
Lori, what's your offer?
I'm gonna go
$100,000 for 15%.
