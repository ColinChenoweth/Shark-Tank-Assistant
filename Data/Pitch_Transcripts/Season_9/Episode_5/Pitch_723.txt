?I'm Eric Huang.
?And I'm Steven Mazur.
And we live
in Detroit, Michigan.
Eric and I met
through Venture for America.
Which is a nonprofit
that connects college grads
with start?ups
in America's emerging cities.
We put our heads together,
and we realized we both have
the same problem,
and so did millions of other
guys around the country,
and that's when we started
Ash &amp; Anvil.
Service.
I was born and raised
in Detroit,
and I graduated high school
in 2009.
That year, the recession
in Detroit was at its peak,
and the auto industry
was at its worst.
Detroit was in a tough spot,
but that's why I wanted to build
a company here.
There we go!
All right.
I moved here three years ago,
and in those three years,
there's been
incredible change ??
new restaurants,
new construction everywhere.
Really big opportunity
for us to be a part of it.
I think a lot of guys
would like that.
It's hard to start a business
whatever generation you are,
but for millennials,
it's even tougher.
We don't have as much experience
or resources
to really get
off the ground.
I think what we do have
is an ambition to get it done.
Detroit's the comeback city,
and it's the underdog,
and as a smaller company,
we feel like that, too.
There's a lot that the country
could learn from Detroit,
and we think that it's a great
place to build a business.
Hi, Sharks!
I'm Eric Huang.
And I'm Steven Mazur.
And we're
from Detroit, Michigan.
?Our company ??
?Hey, hey!
I don't think
they can see us.
Guys, can you go
stand over there?
[ Chuckles ]
That's much better.
Our company is Ash &amp; Anvil,
and we're seeking $100,000
in exchange
for 12.5% of our company.
As you can see,
we're short.
Us shorter guys
have a really tough time
finding shirts that fit.
We're forced to either
buy custom clothes,
tailor everything we purchase,
or do something that really
boosts the old self?esteem ??
shop in the kids section
just to get the right fit.
Look at the shirts
we're wearing today!
These shirts
do not look good.
The sleeves and body lengths
are too long,
the neck is too big, and
the overall fit doesn't work.
?Awful.
?These are ??
These are normal clothes
made for guys like them,
not for guys like us.
These are the only available
options for shorter guys.
Now, let's try
Ash &amp; Anvil.
?Whoo!
?[ Chuckles ]
Wow!
All right.
Now, I know
what you're thinking,
but no,
we're not models.
But our everyday shirt will
sure make you feel like one.
It fits much, much better.
The lengths are correct
and the shirt fits
a shorter guy like me.
Sharks, with your investment,
we can continue to grow
our sales to heights
we can only dream of
and achieve our goal
of keeping grown men everywhere
from shopping
in the kids section.
Thanks, guys.
We're all set.
Watch your head
on the way out.
We brought some shirts today
if you'd like to take a look.
All right.
Thank you, Eric.
Yep.
Here you go, Lori.
?Thank you.
?Thank you.
And Kevin.
?Ash &amp; Anvil.
?Appreciate that.
?Thank you.
?"Shorter guy clothes."
You got it.
Guys, it is wise to brand it
"shorter guys' clothes"
given the stigma
you just spoke about?
?You tell us, Kevin.
?Excuse me.
[ Laughs ]
I'm of medium height.
We thought a ton about,
how do we brand this?
Do we say
"vertically challenged"?
Do we say "not so tall"?
What's the best way
to do it?
And we ended up
with "shorter guy clothes"
'cause we were sick of trying
to beat around the bush.
Why is it called Ash &amp; Anvil?
So, Ash comes
from Detroit City's motto ??
"We will arise
from the ashes."
And Anvil's a tribute to the
manufacturing legacy of Detroit.
That's cool.
Oh, very cool.
?Thanks.
?Steven, I'm a tall guy.
?What's a short guy considered?
?What's a shorter guy's height?
?Yeah.
?So, when we did our studies
and did a ton of fittings
to get our style down,
guys that were
5'8" and below
fit better in our clothes
than traditional ones.
What? Are you saying
I'm short because I'm ??
?5'8"?
?How tall are you?
?I'm 5'6", myself.
?5'8", myself.
Yeah, our average
customer's 5'5".
Let me see.
I'm 5'8".
You're 5'8"?
You're not 5'8"
Yeah, look at the heels.
Look at the heels.
?I'm5'8".
?I'm 5'6".
5'6".
?Oh, no, Daymond.
?Wow.
Get off your toes, Daymond.
Get off your toes.
You're a little taller
than he is.
You are not 5'8",
my friend,
?I'm 5'8".
?You are not ??
I told people I was 5'7"
for years. I'm 5'8".
I'm 5'8".
?You're 5'8"?
?Yeah.
Daymond, you've shrunk.
I'm 5'8".
Not anymore,
you're not.
What do you got in sales?
So, since launching
nine months ago,
we have over $130,000
of sales so far.
?After nine months?
?After nine months.
Okay.
That's not horrible.
That's on our website, 100%,
and we've sold out twice.
It's all online.
Everything's online, right?
?That's correct, yep.
?100%.
Tell us what you sell
those shirts for,
what are your margins,
all the business stuff.
Yep. Our shirts retail
for $79,
and our margin right now
is about 55%.
When we first designed
our fit,
we went to the streets and found
hundreds of shorter guys
and said, "Hey, come over
to our apartment, have a beer,
try on prototypes ??
That'll go over real well
in Detroit.
?Whoa! Whoa, whoa!
?Hey, it worked!
It worked!
It worked!
They came over,
they tried on prototypes.
Looked at every
little detail ??
things like the collar
and the tail drop, the cuffs.
It's always smart
to go ask people
what are their thoughts
to get feedback.
That's why social media
is so great today.
So, what do you guys
really need?
Our biggest challenge right now
is inventory.
How do you acquire the database
of 5'5" guys?
[ Laughs ]
Like, how do you find
that customer?
It's an interesting
challenge.
It's a subset of a subset?subset
market because it's ??
'Cause I'm way
out of your target market.
Well, how big is the market,
is what he's trying to say.
So, if you look at it,
there' one in three American men
are 5'8" and under,
which represents
over 40 million adults
in the U. S. alone.
That's why I always felt
that I was a little shorter
than the average?sized person
because Kevin's
around my height,
Robert's around my height...
I'm way taller.
?Yeah.
?You understand what I'm saying?
You're telling me
I'm walking around
with this problem that
I never realized that I had.
And I think
this is for a man
who wears his shirt
outside of his pants,
so then, of course,
it looks baggy.
I always wear my shirt
inside my pants.
So I think
you're too well?dressed
for most of America,
really.
If you look
at clothes now,
you could buy a suit
in short, right?
I know I wear
a 40 short suit.
Everything else
is small, medium, large,
and it's made
for a 6?foot guy.
We're selling clothes that
are more everyday and casual ??
Steven, I think
it's a very clever idea.
I think you guys
are doing a good job.
Thank you.
Not really my line of clothing.
It doesn't fit me.
I'm out.
Thank you.
We have clothes
that guys love.
We have 900 happy customers
that want to buy more shirts.
So it's about financing
enough to meet that demand
and preparing
for new products.
And we haven't
even talked
about things like
jeans, chinos, shorts...
Master what you're doing first,
right?
?Exactly.
?And you guys are really smart.
You're doing
everything right.
But for me, I don't think
I'm the right partner for you,
so for that reason,
I'm going out.
Thank you.
We've looked at brands
like Destination XL
