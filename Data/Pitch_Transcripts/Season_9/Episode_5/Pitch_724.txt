Hello, Sharks,
I'm Sean Spencer.
Herjavec: Sean, you did
$1.4 million with 9.
How do you do more?
If you had more machines,
would you sell more?
Absolutely. I mean,
that's also why we're here.
We need more machines,
we need marketing,
we need sales.
On a Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
we are at capacity.
Glenn: While we appreciate
Kevin's offer,
we came in for a partnership,
not just money,
which is why we're so happy
to be with Robert,
'cause, again,
he saw what we were doing,
