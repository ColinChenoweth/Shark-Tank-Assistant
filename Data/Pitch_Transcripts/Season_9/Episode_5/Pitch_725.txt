and Lane Bryant,
who really led the way
for plus?size women
and big?and?tall men.
You have plus?size women
and petite women.
You have big?and?tall men,
and then there's nothing,
even though a third of us
are short.
I'm puzzled
on how to market it accurately.
And, you know, I think it's
an emotional thing, as well.
I don't want to accept
the fact
that I need
special clothes, probably.
But you still need them.
This is not for me.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Kevin and Mark?
What are you doing, Mark?
We're sold out,
and guys continually come to us
wanting to buy shirts.
And again, the biggest challenge
is inventory.
Once we get more inventory in,
we know we can do it.
Cuban: You know, guys,
I like it, right?
I like your focus on it.
I think there's a niche
opportunity there.
I'll make you an offer
12.5% is not enough.
I'm gonna have to get 25%,
but I'll offer you $150,000.
?For 25%?
?Right, for the 25%.
So that's my offer.
It's not a negotiation.
It's not a "Let me see
what Kevin has to say."
It's a yes?or?no conversation.
We really appreciate the offer,
would love to work with you.
We've spent a lot of time
getting to this point.
Can we hear what Kevin
has to say first?
Nope.
Wise man.
Herjavec: Wow.
Your call, guys.
Bird in the hand.
$150,000. 25%.
I'll do the $100K for 15%.
What do you think?
I'm out, guys.
We'll ??
If you're in,
we'll take the offer.
Okay.
You're lucky I like you.
O'Leary:
Wow, you're lucky he likes you.
Nice moonwalk.
A tall guy working
with the short men!
I love it.
Excited about that,
about making money.
?Appreciate it.
?My pleasure, guys.
Next time,
when you get a yes, take it.
?Okay.
?We will. Thank you.
You almost lost that deal.
That was a serious moonwalk,
boys.
?Thank you, guys.
?Thank you!
Cuban: Thanks, guys.
?Whew!
?Wow.
We could become the first
big company for shorter guys,
and there's a lot of us
out there
that are looking
for clothes.
We do have a chip on our
shoulder, and we're underdogs.
Detroit's the underdog city,
shorter guys are underdogs,
and we're an underdog company.
But we're gonna
make it work.
?Whew!
?[ Sighs ]
Narrator: Next into the Tank
is a premium version
of a special event activity.
Hello, Sharks,
I'm Sean Spencer.
And I'm Ryan Glenn,
and we are Mirmir
from Los Angeles, California.
We're here today seeking
$350,000 for 10% equity stake
in our company.
Mirmir is reinventing
how and where photos
are captured on a global scale.
The good old?fashioned
photo booth.
It's the world's
first selfie machine
and taker
of horrible photos.
Their end results are always
cheap and tacky and childish,
and that's why
they're never framed
and they're never
shared online.
So meet the future.
Mirmir, the photo booth that
makes everybody look beautiful.
Our proprietary software
instantly smoothes your skin,
adding this radiant glow.
You can always take
a good photo with Mirmir,
no matter who are you.
I mean, if we could make
this guy look good...
[ Laughter ]
Wow.
Greiner:
Look at your glowing skin, Mark.
It's our cutting?edge technology
that has Mirmir being invited
to the most
exclusive parties
and high?end events
in the world.
So we would like
to invite you all
to come out now
so we can take some photos
and make everybody
look beautiful with Mirmir.
Yeah!
?Let's do it.
?Come on, Lori!
?Coming.
?Everybody, come on.
Everybody?
All right.
Let's get a couple
with everybody in it.
All right,
let's get everybody in here!
Everybody in like
you love each other.
?Can you fit us all in?
?1, 2, 3.
I love that.
?Daymond, Lori?
?Oh, wow!
?Oh, my God!
?Oh, my God!
?That's incredible!
?That actually is beautiful.
Awesome.
Herjavec: First of all,
let me tell you this.
You guys were at my wedding.
?We were.
?We were.
I didn't get a chance to use it,
but my wedding planner Mikey
booked you guys in,
and I saw the photos after,
and I was like, "Wow!
The photos are amazing!"
Why are the photos so good?
Um, well,
it's a number of things.
So photo booths
have been around forever.
They've always been cheap
and tacky and childish
and gimmicky
and low quality,
and we're both
photographers,
and we wanted to take
studio?quality photographs
in sort of a photo?booth?like
experience,
something that's instant
and something that's quick.
But tell me
what's unique about it.
So, through flattering
lighting ?? That's huge.
Lighting, as you guys know,
is big.
Mm?hmm.
Software.
We have software
that instantly goes in
and gives you a very tasteful
amount of retouching.
What does the software do?
How does it work?
So, my background is also
in fashion
in terms of photography,
and so I'm used to sitting
for two, three days at a time,
you know, retouching.
So what we decided was
why can't you retouch
in four seconds?
There's got to be
a way to do it, right?
There's an app called Smoothing
that does that quite nicely.
Cuban: There's a lot of apps
that do this.
Yeah, there's nothing ??
Yeah, but it's really
beautiful.
You guys
pre?select a filter
that you think
is most appropriate,
but there's no
secret sauce there.
Like we've said,
you've been at a couple events.
You guys at the hot brand,
the hot photo booth right now.
So tell us
what that's translated into,
and how are you
gonna stay hot?
Um, well, I think,
in terms of dollars,
if you want to talk
about that ??
?Yeah, that's why we're here.
?Sure.
Sales in three years
are just north of $4 million.
Wow. And how many machines
do you have?
Right now,
we have nine machines.
And tell us
about the business model.
So, baseline price
in larger markets,
in New York or Los Angeles,
is $2,750.
That would get you
just the photo booth itself
and the printing.
We also have the texting,
and social media aspect of it.
Those are add?ons.
?What's the highest package?
?$3,650.
Is it mainly weddings,
bar mitzvahs, festive type of...
So, our core business model
has been live events.
We've busted our butts
for three years now 24/7.
?It's just been the two of us.
?All on the West Coast, right?
?All over the country.
?No, right now ??
We work all over
the U. S.
You package this up,
you ship it?
We take it on a plane
with us, yeah.
Herjavec: Sean, you did
$1.4 million with 9.
How do you do more?
If you had more machines,
would you sell more?
Absolutely. I mean,
that's also why we're here.
We need more machines,
we need marketing,
we need sales.
On a Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
we are at capacity.
We can't meet demand right now.
So Monday Tuesday, Wednesday,
they're not being used.
We can't meet
the demand you have.
?No, we cannot meet demand.
?We're telling people no.
?What does a machine cost?
?The machine would cost $22,000.
Ouch.
And how much money did you raise
to start this?
We didn't.
It's all personal.
?It's all your own money?
?Yeah, I mean ??
?How much did you put up?
?Uh... [ Chuckles ]
It's kind of funny ??
I mean, we think $250,000.
We think it's a little more
than that.
We stopped counting
at $250,000.
You came up
with the right lighting
so people have
a good experience.
Sure.
That's a win, right?
That's what matters
at the end of the day.
?But as a potential investor...
?Sure.
...I'm not getting a sense
that there were any unique
filters that were in there.
?Right?
?It's one filter.
Right, well,
that's what I'm saying, right?
We're producing
500 events a year.
We're taking care
of our families.
We're putting food
on the table.
And good for you.
What is the thing that you have
that's so valuable?
This.
?What?
?Demand.
?High quality and ??
?High quality and demand.
We can't meet demand.
We're in four markets.
Yeah, but this is something
other people can replicate.
If somebody can replicate it
that easy,
why haven't they done it
in the last five years?
Okay, you've developed
one filter.
That's all your IP,
or what else?
O'Leary:
There is competition,
but what I'm trying
to figure out
is just the return
on investment.
Right now,
we're making $400,000 pre?tax.
You get my $350,000.
What does the next
12 months look like?
Well, one, we would scale
just live events.
That's simple.
We would double
that quickly.
Venues is where we want to go,
and this is where ??
Different business.
It is a different business,
and again,
that's why we're here.
We clearly have a skill set,
an expertise...
Do you think I'm gonna pay you
at the Mavs' arena
?to come in and do this?
?Yes.
No.
Why would they pay you?
We feel differently
because we are in conversations
with some of the biggest
retailers in the world.
Look, congratulations.
I'm not trying
to take away anything
from what
you've accomplished.
Sure.
It's more about what I see
in terms of an investment.
Right?
It's expensive and complicated,
and lot of people
are gonna use that as an entree
into this business.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay.
Sorry to hear that, Mark.
I really love this product,
and Mark is talking about it
from more
technical geek side, right?
I'm talking about it
from a consumer side.
So I love this product,
but I notice myself ??
Every other day,
I buy a new gadget
in regards to taking
a picture.
But what I'm saying is,
I'm always
finding something new,
and this market changes so fast
that I'm just afraid
that you may have a good run
for three years,
five years and change with it,
or you may not.
The market's just moving
too fast for me, so I'm out.
Sorry to hear about that.
I don't really see
how this works
in the stadium
and event arena like that
because I think people
are engaged in the event more
than they're gonna go find
in a corner at your booth.
If you had said
you want to blow this up
for parties, weddings,
be premium,
the Cadillac or the Mercedes
of this, I would have been in.
But because of the direction
you want to take it,
?I'm going out.
?But I think it's both.
I'm sorry to hear that 'cause
it's actually both, but...
Sean and Ryan
are seeking $350,000
for 10% of their premium
photo booth company, Mirmir.
They have one offer from Kevin,
but Robert is also interested.
I'd love to have 50%.
?50%?
?Yeah.
?Whoa.
?What?
A full partnership.
Would you do a full partnership?
?Why would you do that?
?We wouldn't.
Well, I'm just asking.
Well, you're valuing
the business at $700,000.
No, I'm not asking
for that dollar amount.
What dollar amount
would you need?
At 50%?
I couldn't do a deal at 50%.
?You couldn't?
?No.
?Oh, hell no.
?At 50%?
'Cause we're churning out cash.
There is no way I'm gonna ?? No.
John: I'm just asking
a question. Why not?
It was just a question.
I just wanted to know,
what would you sell 50% for?
I mean, we think ??
We think it's more valuable
than that.
?You asked for $350,000 for 10%.
?Right.
Meaning the entire thing
is worth $3.5 million today.
Right.
He doesn't want to sell
a control position.
I think he's made it clear.
Okay.
I mean, I'm happy
to entertain more equity.
I think we're gonna explode.
I think we're gonna get big.
What's the most equity
you would sell today?
For the right dollar amount,
I would entertain
maybe 18% to 20%,
but that's on the high side.
Would you do 20% for $700,000?
Same valuation, just more equity
for the same price?
Yes.
20% for $700,000.
I think
I would do that, yes.
Because it would allow me
to expand even that much faster.
I'll give you $700,000
for 20%.
What do you think?
?Yeah?
?Yeah.
?We'll take your deal.
?You got a deal.
?All right!
?There you go.
?Happy to do it.
?Thanks, man.
?I'm so excited!
?We're gonna go kill it.
We're gonna kill it!
Thanks guys.
We appreciate your ??
Hey, let's get a picture!
Let's get a picture!
?Yeah!
?Yeah!
[ Laughs ]
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
Feels like he bought a toy.
I'm very excited.
Thank you.
It's very cute
'cause you like toys.
Love toys.
I love it.
And this is like
the ultimate toy.
Glenn: While we appreciate
Kevin's offer,
we came in for a partnership,
not just money,
which is why we're so happy
to be with Robert,
'cause, again,
he saw what we were doing,
he gave us the dollars,
and we're gonna go kill it.
Narrator: Earlier this season,
Cyndi Lee made a deal
with Lori Greiner
for her multi?use silicon
kitchen tool, Safe Grabs.
I make millionaires.
That's what I'd like to do
with you.
All right.
Let's make a deal.
Narrator:
Let's see what she's up to now.
