My name is Derrek Burr
and I'm from North Attleboro,
Massachusetts.
I am the president and C. E. O. of
Kwik?Hang Curtain Rod Brackets.
Now, I'm here today
seeking an $80,000 investment
in exchange for a 20% equity
stake in our company.
Sharks, as a police officer
and a former Marine,
I've faced many challenges
in my life,
but none mightier
than hanging a curtain rod.
Now, our unique curtain hardware
is gonna change the way
that you hang your curtains,
making old
curtain hardware obsolete.
Introducing
Kwik?Hang Curtain Rod Brackets,
one of a kind,
patented curtain rod brackets
that you can use
to hang your curtains
in a matter of seconds,
leaving no visible damage.
Now, our proprietary brackets
set themselves apart
from anything else on the market
by eliminating the need
for nails, screws, drilling,
measuring, or marring up
the face of your woodwork.
Now, we've taken the trouble
and aggravation
out of hanging your curtains.
Allow me to demonstrate
just how simple it is
to install our curtain hardware.
Blink, Sharks,
and you might just miss it.
[ Chuckles ]
Give it a few taps
on this side.
And a few taps
on that side.
You just tap it and you're done.
It's that easy.
Wow.
Now all you have to do
is hang your curtains.
See, Sharks,
I wasn't lying when I said
they install in seconds.
Very cool.
No fuss, no muss,
and no plaster dust.
But I know what you're probably
thinking right now.
Will they hold?
What I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna hang
two 10?pound bags of potatoes
from the curtain rod.
I often do that.
[ Laughs ]
Good for you.
Wow.
Sharks, Kwik?Hang
curtain hardware
is the fastest, strongest,
and simplest way
for you to hang
your curtains.
So don't leave me
hanging out here all by myself.
The window of opportunity
is open
for you to invest
in our company.
Thank you for time.
And I'll now pass out
some samples.
Cool. Good job.
I loved the demo.
Very effective.
So be very careful because there
are very sharp pins on these,
but Lori's are the white.
?The white? Thank you.
?Thank you.
?Careful, they're sharp.
?"Shahp."
Mr. Wonderful,
of course, you get gold.
Thank you.
Daymond, silver.
Thank you.
Mark.
?Thank you.
?Thank you.
This is a very thin
hook here.
Correct.
What about curtain rods
that are 1 to 1.5 inch
in diameter or larger?
Do you have different
sizes of this?
We do have different sizes.
So, right now,
we can hold curtain rods
from half?inch
all the way up to an inch.
Why don't you have
the capability of going bigger?
Basically,
my dad started this company,
and he gave the customers
what they wanted.
But this is a piece
of metal, right...
Yes.
that's, like,
stamped or formed.
Right.
So why couldn't you
just form it to be 1.5 inches?
I mean, it's very possible,
it's just the tooling
is expensive to do that,
so we're just working
with what we have right now.
?So it's tooling.
?Correct.
Now, your dad started
the company?
He did.
Is he still
part of the company?
Uh, unfortunately,
we just lost him
this past April, so...
Oh, I'm sorry.
My dad was in the jewelry
business his whole life,
and he worked for a gentleman
that had a similar idea.
So my dad started
a little company on the side
and started selling them,
and he started
having some success.
So my dad went back
to his boss and said,
"Well, what if I go out,
I apply for the patents,
I get the inventory going?"
So my dad's boss basically
laughed at him and said,
"You're never gonna
make any money.
Go ahead."
And that's the wrong thing
to say to my dad.
You never challenge my dad
'cause he's gonna
prove you wrong.
?And so he started the business.
?He did.
How long ago?
2013.
And he was so proud
of those patents.
And Derrek,
what are your sales?
It's been about three years.
$120,000.
All right, what are your sales
just this year,
and what were they
last year?
So, this year, year?to?date,
we're at $31,000.
Last year, $42,000.
And what do they sell for,
and what do they cost you
to make?
Singles landed are $3.15.
We sell them for $10.95.
Doubles are $4.
We sell them for $17.95.
How do you sell them,
Derrek?
Everything is online.
So from my website, eBay,
and we just signed a deal
with Houzz.
So, what do you do
full time,
'cause obviously $31,000
isn't gonna pay the bills.
Right.
So full?time,
I'm a police officer.
And who's running
the company?
I am.
But, Derrek,
you're making money.
I mean,
your margins are good.
On the $31,000,
you probably made,
what, $18,000,
something like that?
So, off the $31,000,
we've made about $7,000
'cause I've been trying
to grow the brand.
The business
was in my dad's apartment.
I got us
into a warehouse space.
I started having
the packaging done, so...
The real issue
about getting this
in broad distribution
is getting the packaging right
to tell the story
of what this does...
Right.
...which is gonna be
one challenge.
And then getting a distributor
that sells curtain rods.
?Right.
?Sell them together...
But the trouble is,
you're a full?time ??
and thank you again
for your service ??
police officer.
This is not a crazy deal.
It's not overvalued
or anything.
It's just ??
Who's gonna do the work?
You're looking at him.
Me running this business
is the one last link to my dad.
This business
meant everything to my dad,
and this makes me
still feel close to him.
So I would retire
from the police department
to run this business.
Wow.
Then I got to ask you
a question.
Are you motivated to do this
because it's in his honor,
or do you really
want to grow this business?
Because those are two
different things.
I'm passionate
about the business
because it was started
by my father and my mother,
and this is the only thing
that she has left of my dad.
This is the only thing
I have left of my dad.
So this is basically
everything for us.
Would you have the same
motivation to go on
with sales
of $30,000, $40,000?
You can't live off that.
But, Kevin,
with all due respect,
this is only with me
doing this part?time.
If I had a Shark behind me
with the marketing and exposure,
I have doubt in my mind
that this thing could blow up.
Derrek, it wouldn't take off
the way you would expect it to.
Because there's still
blocking and tackling
that has to take place.
?Right.
?Right?
And so while what you've
accomplished is phenomenal,
what your dad
has accomplished,
but at the same time,
you're not investable yet
because you're still
figuring all this out.
I don't think you're ready,
and honestly,
it's not my wheelhouse,
it's not really my strong suit,
these types of products.
So, for those reasons,
I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I mean, look, people have been
doubting me my whole life.
People told me
that I would never make it
through Marine Corps boot camp,
told me I didn't have
what it took,
said I was too small.
I served four years honorably
as a United States Marine,
and I earned a Navy &amp; Marine
Corps achievement medal.
People said I would
never become a cop,
said it was not possible.
I've been on the police force
now for almost five years.
I continue to chase
my dreams.
Good for you.
To honor your father
is beautiful thing,
and you've already done it.
?You're you.
?Right.
So I think here,
I would take pause and stop
and think about ??
Is this the life that you
want to live day to day?
?Because it's a huge commitment.
?Right.
You have four patents.
To me,
it's a licensing play.
Right.
And getting somebody
to buy that
and then they actually
have the manpower
to put it everywhere, to me,
would be the greatest
legacy your father ever had.
Right.
And, for me,
I know what it would take ??
I mean, it's huge.
It's a huge
amount of effort.
For those reasons,
I personally need to be out.
Thank you.
There's a theory out there
that "I need to quit my job
and I need to just go,
you know, all out,"
and what you do is then
you can't pay the bills
and then you can't put
any money into the business.
Mm?hmm.
You need to run
this business,
but I don't think you need
to quit your job, either.
It wouldn't be
in your best interest
for me to help because you need
to slowly grow this,
?so I'm out.
?Thank you.
The right path here
is going to find
that licensing deal
that Lori suggested to you.
Right.
You want to make him proud,
go get a royalty check
of $50,000 a month,
because you have these patents.
Right.
That's the gift
he really left you.
You have four.
Right. Right.
It's one of those deals that
it's just a beautiful story,
but as a business,
extremely hard to invest in.
I'm sorry, Derrek,
I'm out.
Derrek, I love the dream,
and you have great purpose.
Great businesses are started
with great purpose.
You know, my dad was thrown
in jail 23 times,
and, uh,
when I was 21 years old,
I was, uh ??
I didn't know
what I wanted to do.
I was a bit of a mess,
partying, hanging out.
People would say, "What do you
want to do with your life?"
I'd go,
"Eh, it doesn't matter."
My dad sits down with me
and he says,
"I went through hell
so that you
could have the opportunity
I never had."
That was it.
That was it.
And for the rest of my life,
people always said,
"Oh, how do you work so hard?
You only sleep
three hours a day."
It must be hard.
And I always used to say,
"Anything I do in lifetime
will never be as hard
as what that man went through."
But you've got to have something
that you can apply that to
in order to build
a bigger business.
I wouldn't quit
the job today.
The price point
is just too small.
But maybe
you'll figure it out.
I can't be in today,
but I wish you all the best.
I'm out.
Thank you all for your time.
Derrek,
can I shake your hand?
?Sure.
?Thank you very much.
My pleasure.
Thank you very much.
?Wish you all the best.
?Thank you.
?Thank you very much.
?Congrats, Derrek.
?Thank you, guys.
?Thank you, Derrek.
That's a good guy,
right there.
Derrek:
Yeah, I'm disappointed.
I got a little
knocked down today,
but my dad never gave up
on this product,
and neither will I.
I'm going to definitely
prove them wrong.
It's hard to look at that
and not want to help him,
but you realize
it's not a business.
It's small.
It's not
that he's not a business.
He's just not ready.
It's just small.
It's hard.
Right?
He'll figure it out.
He's got time.
He's just here too early.
I love the passion, though.
I love the drive.
Narrator: Next into the Tank
is a product that is fun
and functional.
