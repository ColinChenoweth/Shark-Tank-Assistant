How do I get my dough back
if I'm just a 10% shareholder?
Well, I think I could actually
get your money back
just by expanding core business
and doubling that
in 12 to 18 months.
All of the concerns about
changing technology will occur.
There's also a wedding
next Sunday,
and somebody is gonna pay
for this thing.
I look at it as a company
that can support debt,
so here's an offer.
You don't have to take it,
but I'm not sure
you're gonna get anything else.
That's always a good sign,
right?
"You don't have to take it."
No, because I don't
want to take the risk of being
a minority shareholder
with no exit.
I'll loan you $350,000
at 18% interest.
I want 5% equity
in the company
as a fee for providing
that line.
?It's the Loan Shark Tank again.
?No, it isn't.
If you have a better structure,
Robert, you should provide it.
?Are you done, Mr. O'Leary?
?I'm not finished yet.
There's more?
I happen to think
you have to run like hell,
and I think
the more machines you get,
the more cash you'll make.
I'd be very careful
with your assumptions
about those other venues.
What I'd like to see
is you put them in a couple,
?prove out your theory.
?Sure.
Meanwhile, you're doing
weddings, my friend.
I love the business.
It's fantastic.
?I'm with you on the venues.
?Thank you.
I agree with Kevin
in that you got to run.
You got to go to every market.
Oh, we absolutely agree.
That's why we're standing here.
I mean, we've turned down money
to be right here, right now.
You got to go fast.
I really like
the corporate idea.
I think that's
gonna be really big.
But I need more equity.
How do I get more equity?
Well, what's your offer?
I need more than 10%.
How much do you need?
?[ Chuckles ]
?I'd love to have 50%.
?50%?
?Yeah.
?Whoa.
?What?
Narrator:
Three Sharks are out.
Schultz: Hello, Sharks.
My name is Doug Schultz
and this is Justin Rietema,
and we are the inventors
of the Human Bobber
line of flotation products.
We're here today
seeking $120,000
for 15% stake
in our company.
Sharks, Doug and I love
being out in the water,
and living in Florida,
we have lots of opportunities
to do just that.
Whether it's a river, lake,
or ocean,
we want to be outdoors
with our friends ??
boating, wakeboarding,
or floating ??
in any opportunity
possible.
'Case we all know
what the best part
about boating is,
right, Sharks?
You know what it is!
It's cracking open
a cold one
and floating behind the boat
with your buddies.
Yes.
But things like rafts,
noodles, inflatables ??
they're impossible
to stay on.
You fall in the water
and you get water in your beer.
Not cool!
Inflatables ?? hard to blow up,
take up so much room.
Eventually, we said
to heck with all that stuff,
left the floats
and clutter at home.
We just used an old life vests
to float around.
So one afternoon,
while floating around
in our life vests,
uncomfortably, of course...
Oh, yeah.
...and probably after
a few too many cold ones...
Probably.
[ Laughs ]
...Doug and I decided
to change the game
and create one all?inclusive
personal flotation device.
And that day, the Bottoms Up
dual?purpose vest was born.
This is the world's first
Coast Guard?approved,
multifunctional
personal floatation device.
This replaces your required
Coast Guard?approved
boating vest,
your specialty watersports vest,
and all your rafts,
noodles, and inflatables
with one easy?to?use,
comfortable,
easy?to?store device.
But wait, Sharks!
That's not it!
We also have our
Scuttlebutt triple?purpose line
of recreational
floatation devices.
?Hey!
?Okay!
?Hey!
?Hot models everywhere.
You guys were quiet!
With the Scuttlebutt,
you can float in it,
you can float on it,
or you can sit on it
for all your floatation
and recreational needs.
Also, our Bottoms Up,
you can use it
for all your watersports needs.
And then when you're done,
you simply flip it upside down,
jump in the water for a full day
of relaxation and floatation.
And when you add in
all the extra Scuttlebutt
configurations,
you and your friends
you're in for a good day
on the water,
and you won't be getting water
in your drink
wearing these bad boys.
Sharks, our products
are the all?in?one, get?it?done,
have?fun?in?the?sun,
slam?dunk, home?run,
best floatation
devices on the market.
So, Sharks...
Together: Who wants to join
our float club?
O'Leary:
I've got a lake house.
I've got a few
of the chair things.
They're made out of foam.
They're very inexpensive.
How much does that one cost?
So, we sell these for $65,
and the vest, we sell for $90.
How much does it cost you
to make each one?
The Bottoms Up
dual?purpose vest
we get for $27.80,
including shipping.
The Scuttlebutt triple?purpose,
we get for $22.80.
So, let's understand
your business.
How many have you sold?
So, to date,
we sold $63,000
and we've been selling
for three years.
?Oh!
?Whoa.
That may not sound great.
You're right,
it doesn't.
I know, but we started
the production of this
and the idea six years ago,
and it took us two to three
years just in the development,
working back and forth
with the manufacturer.
Right.
And the patent process
and the Coast Guard process
alone has been
a three?year ordeal.
Why only $63,000 in sales
over three years?
About three years ago,
we're like, "Oh, my God!
We're gonna go
for every big?box retailer."
And we went to them,
and they were like, "We love it!
Is it Coast Guard approved?"
No.
"All right, guys, well, come
back and see us when it is."
The challenge is gonna be
demonstrating it,
because people
are gonna look at it,
and maybe
you have a hang tag,
but you're gonna have to have
a point?of?purchase display.
There's just so much
expense involved.
Well, that sounds
like a nightmare.
?I don't like that.
?No, that's right.
My two cents is you're gonna
have to do that online,
you know, when people
are looking to make
those purchase decisions.
?Too small a market.
?Yeah, it's too small.
Well, maybe the market's
not as huge, but look,
one of the worst things
that could happen
is you get a big order
from a big box
and it doesn't sell
and you're out of business.
You know, the funny thing
about your deal,
I got to be honest with you,
is I spend all of my time
in the lake
in one of those foam chairs
with a bottle of Chardonnay.
[ Laughs ]
And I sit around
and direct traffic
when my kids are going
in and out of the boats.
I'm like the traffic cop
in the chair.
I am definitely gonna buy
one of these, but I'm trying ??
Would you float around in it
or your chair?
Well, the trouble
with the chair, actually, is ??
This is better,
because the chair,
you have to actually
balance yourself,
and the more you drink,
the worse it gets.
So I just ??
The thing about "Shark Tank"
is you get nailed
on the real problem.
This thing is ??
It's a great product.
It's gonna be hanging
in the marina.
Who's gonna know
what it is?
I think by literally
hanging it upside?down...
I mean,
as they're flipping through,
most of them are on a rack.
I would say the idiot kid
at the store
hung the thing upside down
by mistake.
It's actually detailed by ??
One things entrepreneurs
always have to learn
is when it's your product,
you just think
everybody's focused on it
and you perceive
"This is how I would do it
if I were the customer."
It's never that way.
You always have to perceive
that your customer
doesn't care
about your product.
You have to make them care.
And to that avail, I would say
that's why we're here.
We're creative guys.
We've pushed this thing
for six years,
and we're ready
for a strategic investor.
I'll make you an offer.
I'll give you $120,000
for 33.3%.
Narrator:
All Sharks are still in.
Doug and Justin have an offer
on the table from Kevin O'Leary
for the multi?functional
life vest, Human Bobber.
I'll make you an offer.
I'll give you $120,000
for 33.3%.
That's actually
a really good offer.
Will we be entertaining
anyone else's offers?
I don't think
I'm gonna have a lot
of competition on this one,
I got to be honest with you.
[ Laughs ]
I'm basically paying $120,000
for a life jacket
I can float and drink in.
That's about it.
Cuban: See, here's where
my head's at.
One, I've got a great deal
with Amazon Exclusives.
Right? I have my own
Amazon Exclusive page.
We can get you
your own.
Two, Tower Paddle Board
is an online marketing machine.
But then,
on the flip side,
the untold secret
of "Shark Tank" Season 8 now
is that having done this
and having
71 "Shark Tank" deals,
I already know that your
accounting's gonna be a mess,
that I'm gonna have to come in
and clean you all up,
and I'm so sick and tired
of babysitting companies
at that level.
You guys don't even have
an income statement, right?
I mean,
it's a spreadsheet.
Let's not get
ahead of ourselves.
QuickBooks
was way too expensive.
Well, you know,
I think it's very clever.
You did a better mousetrap
on something
that's been kind of boring.
But sometimes,
investing in business,
to me, feels almost like
a poker game, you know?
You don't know what's the next
card that's gonna come.
And, to me, you're either
all in or you fold.
And I'm looking at this
and I'm thinking
I'm gonna have to fold.
You're just starting,
so I'm out.
?Thank you very much.
?Thank you.
It's gonna be very difficult
to build a company around this.
This is a feature
to an existing product.
Everybody buys
one life jacket.
People are not gonna buy
another life jacket
even if you can float
into it.
The path to riches in this
is to license it
so that it is the only
life jacket that people buy.
It's not a company today.
I'm out.
We look at,
where's the opportunity,
but then where
is the distribution
and the pipeline that you
can tap into that we have?
Even if I go to my guys
over at Bass Pro,
I can't support them.
I can't push people
into retail,
and if you can't
help support retail,
then you end up failing.
So, in this instance,
I wouldn't be able to help
distribute it, so I'm out.
Well, you have an offer
on the table ?? Kevin's.
Yes, we do,
and it's a great offer.
And Mark hasn't
made up his mind.
Are you looking
at this?
Okay, I'll consider helping
Kevin, but let me ??
I'll let you guys
convince Kevin of this.
Why would anybody
help Kevin?
Because I want
to help them.
You asked for 33.3%?
I got to have
at least that, yeah.
That's fine.
10% of that goes to me,
and I'll hook them up
with the Amazon Exclusives
and connect them
with Tower Paddle Board
and let them use
my back office
'cause I know
their accounting sucks, right?
Yeah, look,
that makes sense.
Guys, this is such
a great deal.
But, Kevin,
I'm not putting in any cash.
[ Laughs ]
So you want me
to fund your 10%?
Yes, because ??
I don't have to make
that decision now.
Mark, when did you lose
all your money?
You need Kevin to fund you?
Look, I'm not gonna do that.
I got to wet my beak.
[ Laughs ]
Mark, In eight years, I never
thought I would see this happen.
Kevin has to pay your way.
That's not gonna happen.
But, look,
at the end of the day ??
It's worth it,
so you have to convince him.
So, Kevin, how much
of the company
are you willing
to offer Mark for ??
None.
Everybody pays in my world.
Everybody gets paid
in mine.
Justin and Doug,
here's the deal.
Put $120,000 up
for 33.3%.
But Cuban's a partner
on this with me,
and he's getting paid equity.
So he gets 10%.
And you understand
the 10% that Mark is getting
is coming from you,
so I'm funding the company
?for 33.3%.
?43.3% total.
And 10% is your...
That's my number.
What are you gonna do?
Well, we appreciate
the offers,
and as crazy
as it may sound,
we're gonna take the offer
'cause we want to see
this thing go somewhere.
?Smart man!
We've been at it
for six years, man.
Smart man.
We want to see it
turn into something.
?Appreciate it.
?Congrats, guys.
?Wow.
?Appreciate it, Mark.
Congrats.
You got to leave
one of these here for me.
?Mark, thanks a lot.
?Thanks, guys.
?Appreciate it.
?Thanks for all that time.
?Bye, guys.
?All right.
Congrats.
Yeah, dude!
[ Laughs ]
That's how we bob!
That's how we bob!
So, I'm pretty sure
we just gave up
10% of our company
for free,
and that may be
a "Shark Tank" first.
And it sounded pretty crazy
when we first heard it,
but I think it's gonna pay off
in the long run.
Having two Sharks
on our team,
we're gonna be able to take
this company sky high.
