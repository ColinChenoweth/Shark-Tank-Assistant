Hi, Sharks.
My name is Matt Hammersley.
I'm Melissa Hammersley, and
we're from Seattle, Washington.
We're here seeking
$500,000 in exchange
for 10% of our company
Novel Effect,
where we bring
stories to life.
At Novel Effect, we've combined
the tradition of story time
with today's technology
to create magical experiences
with children's books.
And we make that magic
in our app that uses
voice recognition
to perfectly sync theme music,
sound effects,
and even characters' voices
all triggered by you
reading a book out loud.
Just pick a book off
of your shelf at home,
tap the same title
in the Novel Effect app,
then simply read aloud.
Hey, kids, you guys ready
to hear a story?
Yeah!
Oh, awesome!
[ Laughter ]
[ Tone plays ]
App: Up next is Novel Effect,
a company making
story time magic.
This one's called "Novel Effect
Goes to Shark Tank."
[ Music plays ]
Whoa!
There once lived a pair
of brave, inventive swordfish...
Aw!
?[ Laughs ]
?...with a simple idea...
[ Ding! ]
Whoa, cool!
...and a very big wish.
[ Chime! ]
So they visit successful,
smart Sharks with a show.
They swim down that big hall
as the doors open wide...
[ "Shark Tank"
theme music plays ]
...then they pitch
their grand plan
with their heads
held quite high.
?[ Laughs ]
?Whoa!
[ Shimmer! ]
[ Pop! Pop! ]
Wow!
Mr. Wonderful makes
the first offer they need.
?[ Chuckles ]
?I have an offer for you.
They'll have to act fast,
or hear...
You're dead to me.
[ Chuckles ]
Mark and Lori make offers,
deals sweet as honey.
?I'm in on that deal, Mark.
?[ Chuckles ]
Then Kevin breaks in...
I know how to make money.
[ Slot machine chiming ]
The swordfish look at each other
and smile with zeal.
?Yes!
?We did it!
Then say it together ??
Sharks, you've got
yourselves a deal!
[ Triumphant music plays ]
[ Laughs ]
Well, kids, thank you so much
for story time.
It's off to bed.
[ Chuckles ]
Yay!
?All right! That's cool.
?Bye, kids. Thank you.
We need your help
to scale our business.
Who's ready to make
story time magic with us?
What are your backgrounds?
I'm a graphic designer.
I'm actually a patent attorney
by trade.
That's super?convenient for you,
isn't it?
?[ Laughs ] I tell you.
?Very convenient for us.
As you can imagine,
all of this is patent?protected.
How did you come up
with this idea.
So, we had this idea
at a baby shower
that was being thrown for us
before our daughter was born.
A friend
was reading to us.
She had the whole room
captivated
with her sound effects and her
little characters' voices.
And it was a light?bulb
moment.
And Matt literally
couldn't stop thinking about it.
Three months later,
our daughter was born.
We had sold our house
to bootstrap it,
and we had moved the
rest of the way
across the country
to Seattle, Washington.
Wow.
Wow.
Really?
You sold everything
to bootstrap this company,
moved across the country ??
Why Seattle?
It ?? It ?? Well, Seattle ??
One, we were close to Amazon,
who we thought would be a great
potential corporate partner.
And have you had any other
investors in it to date?
'Cause you put a value on it
of $5 million.
?Whoa!
?Absolutely.
So, you know,
I just want to point that out
'cause I love stories, too, and
I can't wait to hear that story.
[ Chuckles ]
Yeah, so, we've raised
$620,000 so far.
Ooh.
Wow.
Wow.
$500,000 of which was
a convertible note
at a $4 million cap.
And then we just
got an investment
from the Alexa Fund
at Amazon.
What was your pitch to them
in using Alexa?
Well, we can use
any voice service
that we want to run
our storytelling program.
So I think you can imagine
the capabilities of saying
things like, "Alexa,
I want to read
'Where the Wild Things Are'
with Novel Effect."
So, guys, I'm ??
I think this is great.
Thank you.
I have children,
and to think about
making story time
even more engaging
and exciting is awesome.
As a mother, can you tell me
how easy it is
to use and walk me
through what I do?
So, it's very simple.
We have an app that you download
on the App Store.
From there,
we have our selection of books
that we've created,
soundscapes for
that are available for you.
You ??
Can you tell me how many books
are in your selection?
Right now we've got about
75 in our library.
?Wow.
?Wow.
We are in the process
of building up
our library and working
with our publishing partners.
And what do you have
to pay to license?
We don't actually have to pay
a license fee
for this type
of technology.
And how are you finding
that you are making money
off of the app thus far?
So, we're currently
pre?revenue
while we build
our library of content.
Our business model
is definitely
a subscription?based
business model. $5 a month.
Cuban: But how are you gonna
acquire customers?
We're gonna be in
all the bookstores.
We're gonna be
in Barnes &amp; Noble.
We're gonna be on Amazon.
?Are you sure that's gonna help?
Of course!
That's ??
I mean, if we're at the point
of purchase of the book ??
If you get a book and you see
a sticker on it that says,
"There's a voice?interactive
soundtrack for this" ??
You couldn't name two products
that have had stickers on them
with web URLs
that you can remember.
You're ?? You're assuming
an enormous conversion ratio
based off of seeing, right,
in a bookstore,
which is declining
in the first place. And ??
Which is why we've partnered
with Amazon, as well. And ??
But then I don't
get to see it, right? So ??
I?I?I think that's a valid
partnership.
No, no, no, we're ?? we're ??
we're working with Amazon.
We're hoping to have the link
on Amazon's website, as well,
where you go
to buy this book.
What I'm saying is to
get where you want to go,
given the investment
you have to make for content
on your end, you're making
an enormous binary bet.
So, let me make one thing
very clear.
Our goal and our mission
is not to be the sole
content creators
of this type of
voice?interactive
entertainment, okay?
You want to license
the platform?
Okay, that's not gonna work.
?Is that the idea?
?That's not gonna work.
Absolutely open to license.
That's not gonna work.
Narrator: All Sharks
are still in,
but Mark is skeptical
about the business model
for Novel Effect,
an app that adds
voice?activated music
and sound effects
while you read a book.
So, let me make
one thing very clear.
Our goal and our mission
is not to be the sole
content creators
of this type of
voice?interactive
entertainment, okay?
You want to license
the platform?
Cuban:
That's not gonna work.
?Is that the idea?
?That's not gonna work.
?Absolutely open to licensing.
?That's not gonna work.
I'm ?? I'm confused at what
you're saying is not gonna work.
Just because you have
great content
doesn't mean people
are going to buy it.
And so what you're bet is ??
and you're betting
the entire company ??
is that if they see
a sticker on
the "Mark Cuban Shark Tank"
book,
they're gonna be so curious
about Novel Effect
that they're gonna
download the app
and they're gonna test it.
I?I ??
Have you ever used
virtual?reality goggles?
Yes.
The first response is,
"Wow," right,
"this is pretty cool."
Then you never try it again.
Guys, I think you're
underestimating the challenge,
and for that reason,
I'm out.
?Thank you, Mark. Appreciate it.
?Thank you.
John:
Here's where I am with it.
You're asking for
a $5 million valuation.
You know,
for that amount of money,
I can get Earth, Wind &amp; Fire
to come perform for my child
every night.
[ Laughter ]
I just don't feel
strongly enough about it,
I have to take a pass on it.
So I'm out.
At the Learning Company,
we tried
the subscription service,
and what we found was
the parent was willing to pay
a one?time fee
to buy an experience.
In our case, it was audio CDs
with books.
That was the technology
of the time.
Subscription's never working
for Scholastic,
and we partnered
with them forever.
Getting that parent
at the moment they're making
their reading decision
for their children
is a really short window
of about 60, 90 days.
That's your problem.
Our biggest challenge
at the end of the day
was trying to get
the customer?acquisition value
less than the 36?month
lifetime value of the customer.
It was hell on Earth.
That was 30 years ago.
Don't you think that the way
people connect is different?
It has not?? It's nothing
to do with technology.
Social media, tech?? It is
different because today ??
A child is born ??
A child is born right now.
But today ??
Here's the difference.
You're wrong.
You want to know
the big difference?
You're 100% wrong.
The big difference
is that today ??
Thank goodness you know me,
or you would stay
ignorant on this topic.
I'm gonna build a wall
between you and me,
and I'm gonna have
Mark pay for it.
[ Laughter ]
The ?? A child
is born right now...
Wait.
...and how are you gonna get to
their mother in 36 months?
?Silence.
?[ Chuckles ]
So ??
Let me finish
my thought, please.
Silence. No.
I'm coming in.
I'm out.
Thanks.
I do not agree
with all the naysayers.
I think this is cool
as cool can be.
?Thank you.
?Thank you.
I love it.
?But...
?I love it.
There's no buts.
So I'm gonna give you an offer.
?Can you get that music rolling?
?I do think the valuation is,
you know, a little ??
not sure about that.
But...
Wait for it.
...I just want to be along
for the ride.
?[ Chuckles ]
?And the offer is...?
So my offer is $500,000
for 20%
because I don't know
what I'm gonna have to do,
and I don't know how
I'm gonna get my money back.
?I would like to counter.
?Okay.
You know,
we've got other investors
that have already come in.
Would you be willing
to take that same terms
that we've given our prior
investors of a $4 million cap?
Lori, would you want
to go in together?
If Sara and I were
to go in together...
?Okay, I like that.
?...and I'm just listening...
?I love that.
?...because I've asked you
for the ?? You know,
you get two Sharks,
usually that means
more equity.
Are you willing to give away
more equity?
Doesn't matter.
Um, I am very well?versed
in the infomercial world.
We just did
our Simply Fit Board.
I happen to like
that Sara has a team.
Between the two of us,
we could probably bring
a lot to the table
in different ways.
I know what I can do,
and that is blow up product
in a demonstrable way,
and Sara could help
in the arena of sports.
So we could
team up together...
?Yes.
?...and offer you
$225,000 at 20%.
?Ooh!
?But you're getting two sharks.
?Aah!
?So it's 10% and 10%.
I would definitely do
Mr. Wonderful's deal over that.
Now, we are more
than they are.
You just need one
Mr. Wonderful.
But we need to know
if Sara is interested.
Sara, you want to come in
on this?
Yes.
Okay, guys, you have three
offers on the table.
?It's not a problem.
?Your other two offers ??
So ?? So do you want two Sharks
for $225,000,
20% of your business,
or do you want...?
Would you guys be willing
to match Daymond's offer?
$225,000 for 15%.
?Why would we match his offer...
?It makes it ??
...when you're
getting two of us...
Yeah.
?...versus one?
?It makes it harder for us ??
If you think two Sharks
are important, watch this.
?The answer ?? The answer's no.
?Shazam!
I'm in with Daymond. Two Sharks.
?The answer's no, and we want ??
?Just like that.
?[ Laughs ]
?All right?
?Okay.
?All right.
?Oh, a horrifying thought ??
him in his underwear
on a roller.
?So, but we stay on 20%.
?I agree.
?20%.
?I agree.
And, by the way, guys, I am
pretty integrated in CrossFit.
But if it's two Sharks
you want, you got it.
You've got Mr. Wonderful
with Daymond,
or you have the Sharkettes.
You've got to make
a decision, guys.
Narrator: One Shark is out.
