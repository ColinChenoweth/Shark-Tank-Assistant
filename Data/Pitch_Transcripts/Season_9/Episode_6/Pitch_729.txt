Hi, I'm Andrew Bentley.
I'm originally
from Madison, Wisconsin.
I'm the founder
of Father Figure,
a paternity clothing brand
for the modern dad.
I'm seeking $80,000
for 15% equity in my company.
The person that's had the
largest influence on my life
weighed just 4 1/2 pounds
when I met him.
When I first held my tiny,
but thankfully healthy, son,
I fell in love.
I was hooked on being
a dad and a caretaker.
But in the transition to parent,
very few things from books
to clothing to gear spoke
my language as a dad.
And I'm not the only one
that feels this way.
The amount of time that dads
today spend with their kids
has tripled from 50 years ago.
I'm building a brand
for these modern dads.
Father Figure's clothes
and accessories combine
fashion and function
to make both dad and baby
look good
while they feel good.
Now, to showcase
my clothing line,
I'm gonna treat you Sharks
to a dad?and?baby fashion show.
[ Chuckles ]
First up is Ezekiel
and his son, Nazir.
Aw! [ Laughs ]
Ezekiel's wearing
our paternity shirt.
It's 100% cotton,
has a relaxed neckline,
it has a patch over the shoulder
for snuggling that baby,
and a loop on the hip
for storing
our bandana?print burp rag.
Next up is Fausto.
He's wearing our Booker
denim shirt,
which is perfect for a day out
on the town with your baby.
[ Laughter ]
?Oh, my gosh.
?It has soft patches...
?So cute!
?...in places where dads hold
their babies the most
and a loop on the hip
for storing burp rags
or even toys.
Now, I've taken Father Figure
from crawling to walking,
and I'm looking for a partner
to get us to running.
Thank you so much.
It's an absolute joy to be here.
I'd love to take
any questions you have.
My first question ??
Are these stunt babies?
[ Laughs ]
These are ??
Because they don't cry.
They're so cute!
They're so special.
My kids
were never like that.
?[ Laughs ]
?Aw, look at her.
?Daymond, that's for you.
?I'll take that one.
?Thank you so much.
For Lori.
?This is for Lori.
?For Lori?
?Thank you, Daymond.
?Hi Sara.
?Hi!
?This is for you.
?Thank you.
?And, Mark.
?Thank you, sir.
?Thank you so much.
Thanks.
It's ??
really feels beautiful.
Thank you.
Okay, so,
it's gonna be nap time soon,
so we're gonna have to say
goodbye to the dads and babies.
Oh.
Ohh!
Good job, guys.
Bye, guys.
Bye!
You guys did amazing.
?Bye.
?Bye.
?Bye!
?Not even a peep.
So, the line is bandanas
and t?shirts?
Correct.
Right now we have shirts,
accessories like bandanas,
and I'm working on a swaddle,
as well.
Are you the designer
of these clothing?
I'm not a clothing designer,
but I did design these.
When my wife went back to work,
our son was 12 weeks old.
It was my first time taking care
of a baby, right?
So I was super?nervous.
He was colicky.
And I'm bouncing him
on an exercise ball
like six, seven hours a day.
And when he'd spit up,
it was a critical moment.
I needed a burp rag, and I could
never find it, and...
[ Chuckles ]
Oh, the memories.
?Yeah!
?[ Laughs ]
And I'd always told my wife,
"I want paternity clothes."
And I would get laughed at.
So I bought a button fastener,
and I fastened a burp rag
on my shirt so I would
never lose it.
And my son also has
sensitive skin,
so when I would sooth him,
it would be rough on his skin.
So I started putting patches
on my shirts
in places where I
would hold him.
So, when did you start this?
What year?
And how many have you sold?
So, this is the 11th month,
and I've done $33,000 in sales.
?That's not bad at all.
?Where are you making the sales?
I started a Kickstarter campaign
that ended last July.
I raised $30,000 in 30 days.
Okay, so wait, so wait, so wait.
Your total sales are $33,000.
Correct.
And you raised $30,000
at Kickstarter.
?Right.
?And how are you manufacturing?
So that means
you've only sold $2,500
worth of product
in 11 months.
Is the market
telling you something?
No, so the customer validation
is there.
I mean, with Kickstarter,
the last three days,
we did $12,000.
?Okay.
Tell us about post?Kickstarter,
where you're selling and how.
So after Kickstarter closed,
I was still working
a full?time job.
?Doing what?
?I was at Google.
?Uh?huh.
?I worked on the digital divide.
So about 30%
of American families
don't have Internet in the home,
and it's mostly underserved,
lower?income,
black and Latino families.
I worked with the federal
government and nonprofits
to address a lot
of those barriers.
Are you still at Google,
or you've left?
I left Google.
Are you doing this
full time?
I am now, yeah.
Andrew, I have four children
under the age of 7,
and I have a really hands?on
partner ?? my husband, Jesse.
And at Spanx, you know,
we give paternity leave
as well as maternity leave.
So I really love this idea
of paternity wear.
I love the branding,
and I love the angle.
What are you making
the garments at?
Let's say that denim shirt.
What are you making
the denim shirt at,
and what is it
retailing for?
Landed ?? $76,
and I'm retailing at $128.
You sell the denim shirt
for $128?
That's correct.
So, you know, I liked and was
intrigued by when you had
little things that held,
like, a teething ring, a toy.
You know, it's almost like
a tool belt, right...
?Right, right.
?...for your baby's stuff?
Yeah, absolutely.
So I'm thinking
that's the way
that you really need to go
versus a clothing line.
I can give you my advice,
but I can't give you an offer.
I'm out.
Thank you, Lori.
Cuban: Look, Andrew,
you're doing all the blocking
and tackling
exactly right.
You start with Kickstarter,
you know,
get a feel from your customers,
but the problem is nobody said,
"I need one. I need
to get this for my friend.
I can't believe
they lived without it."
That's the bridge
you have to cross right now.
And for those reasons,
I'm out.
O'Leary: Andrew, let me take
a shot at it.
Unlike the other Sharks,
I don't want to give you
any encouragement.
There's nothing here.
I disagree.
Look, someone has
to tell you the truth.
I'm doing it for you.
It's a complete waste
of your time.
This is going to zero.
I'm out.
Blakely: Andrew,
you're just starting out.
You have a great story.
Where I'm struggling
is on the product.
Maternity wear
is really functional.
I mean, it serves a very
specific need for the woman
as she ??
her body's changing.
This ?? I'm struggling with it
and I'm trying to think
of what else I would add
and I'm coming up dry.
So for that reason, and I wish
you the best, I'm out.
But I would encourage you
to just keep thinking
about your products.
?Sure.
O'Leary: All right,
we're done here.
?Listen, you're so ??
?We're done here. We're done.
You're so close.
We're done, we're done,
we're done.
You're one really good product
idea away.
?Andrew, thank you.
?Thank you so much.
It was really a pleasure.
?Thank you.
Thanks, Andrew.
Good luck, buddy.
?Good luck.
?I wish you all the best.
Good luck.
I didn't get a deal,
but at the same time,
I'm gonna keep moving forward
and learn from it.
?The product was off.
?Right.
And product is everything.
But why not encourage him?
You know what's
everything? Why?
Think of all the great things
that have happened in life
because people were encouraged.
Because I want him to do
something else where
he actually be successful.
You're gonna get him to spend
another 24 months ??
?Get him, Sara! Get him!
?24 months to do...
Listen! You're not ??
...of his time wasting it.
That's ridiculous.
?Talk to her hand.
?[ Laughs ]
That's what I'm gonna do.
Talk to Sara's hand.
?[ Laughs ]
?Next!
