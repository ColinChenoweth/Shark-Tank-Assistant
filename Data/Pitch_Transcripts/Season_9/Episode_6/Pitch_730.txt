Hey, Sharks, I'm Nate Lawrie,
Hi. I'm Tom Hopkins,
Nate's business partner.
Just trying to keep him
on his toes.
As a professional football
player,
taking hits
was an everyday occurrence.
I love football,
but my back ?? not so much.
Foam rolling was a life saver
for my career.
Cool!
Nate, it's intriguing because,
you know, I do roll.
I want to try.
There is a market for this,
no question about it.
In our locker room, we must have
350 different rollers.
Nate, what team
did you play for?
and unfortunately, I had this
nagging back injury
Nate, your wife's father?in?law
is your dad.
[ Chuckles ]
?Yeah.
?Okay.
[ Laughter ]
Maybe I misspoke.
My wife's ??
'Cause he's own?? he's owning
the sporting?goods team,
Nate and Tom have two offers
on the table
for their collapsible
foam?roller company Brazyn.
Kevin, fortunately you're
gonna be in your underwear
'cause you just got spanked.
[ Laughs ]
?Yay! Yay!
?Yes!
?Yay!
?[ Laughs ]
Congratulations, guys.
?So smart.
?So smart.
They have a patent pending
on it.
It fits the criteria of filling
the white space...
[ High pitched voice ]
It fits the criteria.
...which is something that
hasn't ?? Oh, my gosh!
Whoo!
[ Both laugh ]
What just happened.
Lawrie: Those are two powerful
businesswomen
who we respect a ton.
Having both of them onboard
is a dream come true.
