Hey, Sharks, I'm Nate Lawrie,
and I'm from Santa Barbara,
California.
My company is Brazyn Life,
and I'm seeking $225,000
in exchange for 10%
of my company.
When I played in the NFL,
I took a lot of hits.
[ Grunting ]
Not today, Tom!
[ Laughter ]
Hi. I'm Tom Hopkins,
Nate's business partner.
Just trying to keep him
on his toes.
As a professional football
player,
taking hits
was an everyday occurrence.
I love football,
but my back ?? not so much.
Foam rolling was a life saver
for my career.
It helped me keep my focus
on playing and not being stuck
in the training room
waiting for treatment.
But, look, they're bulky, and
they're a pain to travel with.
That's why I set out
to create something better.
I want to make the world's
most portable foam roller
that doesn't suck.
?This is the Morp.
?[ Laughs ]
It is the world's first
collapsible foam roller.
In an instant, you can pull it
out of a backpack,
a carry?on, or a small gym bag,
pop it open...
and be giving your body
some much?needed TLC.
The patented surface texture
is perfect at releasing knots
and flushing toxins
from the muscles.
When you're done,
you collapse back down,
and you're on the go.
So, Sharks, which of you wants
to roll with us?
?[ Chuckles ]
?Right.
Would any?? anyone like to get
up and give it a try?
Cool!
Nate, it's intriguing because,
you know, I do roll.
I want to try.
There is a market for this,
no question about it.
In our locker room, we must have
350 different rollers.
And I bet your trainers
and your coaching staff
are packing big boxes
when they go to away games.
How does that feel, Mark?
It feels like, you know,
a foam roller with spikes
or whatever
they're called.
Yeah, what those nubs are
is they do a really good job
at helping you pinpoint
knots in the muscles
and really help you
to release those.
That's nice.
So, to collapse it,
what you want to do
is you want to locate
these two "push" symbols
on either side and push firmly
all the way down.
?Look at this. That's cool.
?Yep.
You can put it back in your
backpack or your carry?on.
?So, see you guys all kind of...
?That's pretty cool!
That's cool the way
it just pops open.
?Thank you.
?We spent a lot of time
developing the product
and making it
extremely user?friendly.
?Pass it down.
?Thank you.
?Mr. Wonderful.
So what Tom is handing you out
now is your own Morp.
The skins are removable,
washable sleeves.
There you go.
?Appreciate it.
?It collapses back down.
?That's pretty clever.
Nate, what team
did you play for?
So, I started off in Tampa,
and I played for the Saints
and the Buccaneers
then the Bengals.
?Go Bucs!
?And I played ?? Go Buccaneers.
Did you design this?
That's my design, yes.
?And you injured yourself?
?I did.
So, in my third year in the NFL,
I was with the Saints,
and unfortunately, I had this
nagging back injury
that just kept getting worse
and worse throughout the season.
I kept fighting through it
because I didn't want
to let pain get in the way
of my dreams,
but it wasn't sustainable.
And as the team went on to the
NFC Championship game that year,
I was actually laying at home
recovering from a spine surgery.
So as I got into the recovery
process, I became devoted.
I used the foam roller,
and I don't think
I would have played
another five years
of professional football.
?Really?
?I wanted to find something
that I could easily
travel with.
And so I went to a local
hardware store,
built a very rudimentary
prototype in the garage.
When it didn't collapse under
my massive 260 pounds
of tight?end weight,
I knew I had the opportunity
to make something
that was really cool.
[ Chuckles ]
So ?? So, to be clear,
you think that the use
of a foam roller helped you stay
in the NFL for five more years?
?Absolutely.
?Wow.
Is there anything else
close to this on the market?
Is there another collapsible
foam roller?
So, there's nothing out there
on the market currently.
?Do you have a patent?
?It is patent?pending.
So, we're also patent?pending
in Europe,
in Canada, and Australia.
Has anybody
knocked it off yet?
?No.
?No.
How much
do you sell them for?
What do they cost?
How many have you sold?
The whole routine.
So, we retail these
for $68.
So, they cost right now, for our
first production run, $26.75.
?Ooh. That's expensive.
?$26.75 landed?
Yeah.
How much is a typical
foam roller?
A typical foam roller
is gonna run you
around $40.
?Wait a second.
There's lots of cheaper
foam rollers than 40 bucks.
There's lots of cheaper
foam rollers...
The cheap ?? Yeah, the cheap
ones that ??
...but you're buying those ??
Yeah, they break down.
Yeah, they break down. You're
buying them a couple of times.
Yeah, but those
are 15, 20 bucks, right?
Yeah, they're $15, $14.95.
People don't know the
difference, right?
We've already identified ways
that we're gonna be able
to get that down to around $20
by the end of the year.
Okay, well, there you go.
And this month we're gonna do
$50,000 in sales.
We're projecting $2.4 million
over the next 12 months...
?Whoa!
?...with a 20% net profit.
So we're profitable
this month.
What is it specifically
that you need?
Right, so your name value is ??
would be great.
You own a?a professional
sporting?goods team.
?I own a team, too.
?A sporting?goods team?
?Yeah.
?[ Laughing ] Yeah!
?Sorry. So it's ??
?I own part of an NBA team.
I own the ??
?Sara, what team?
?The Hawks.
?You go, girl.
[ Laughs ]
So, are you making them
overseas,
or are you making them here?
We make them at our
manufacturing
facility
in Romania.
?Oh.
?Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You own the manufacturing
facility in Romania?
Yes, so,
my wife's father?in?law
owns a precision parts
manufacturing company.
He had a lot of extra square
footage in his factory.
You trust them.
You have a relationship.
Nate, your wife's father?in?law
is your dad.
[ Chuckles ]
?Yeah.
?Okay.
[ Laughter ]
Maybe I misspoke.
My wife's ??
'Cause he's own?? he's owning
the sporting?goods team,
and it's getting confusing.
?[ Laughs ]
I'm just gonna tie my tongue
and just walk away now.
No, I'm sorry.
Yeah. You're right.
My ?? My wife's father.
Do you ?? Do you have
flexibility in this 10%?
'Cause I don't think you're
worth $2.25 million right now.
I think that
the valuation is fair.
We do project $2.4 million
over the next 12 months.
We're not even
on Amazon yet.
Amazon is by far
the biggest distributor
of foam rollers out there.
John: Let me get the ball
rolling.
Let me tell you something.
?[ Chuckles ]
I love this, so I'm just gonna
really offer money.
What's your offer?
$225,000 for 15%.
Ooh!
Okay, I'll do the deal
for $225,000 for 20%
because one video of me
in my underwear
rolling is gonna blow this thing
right out of the water.
[ Laughter ]
It could also put you
out of business.
So...?
?Anybody else?
?Mark, what are you doing?
?I'm listening.
?Of course.
?You're listening.
?We're listening, too.
?We're very curious.
?We're listening, too.
Carry on.
Let's hear your offers,
ladies.
I am gonna say you guys
have a lot of challenge
ahead of you because this is
a demonstration product.
I mean, I didn't have
any money to advertise.
My moment was being on "Oprah."
So this is kind
of your "Oprah" moment.
You get a foam roller!
You get a foam roller!
You get ??
Everybody gets a foam roller!
Everybody gets a foam roller!
But, here, listen, your price
is a little concerning.
Your margin's
really concerning.
But the product is so unique.
So I'm very interested.
But I want to hear
what Mark has to say.
And your offer is...?
As do I.
[ Chuckles ]
?Mark's out.
?Mark's out?
?There you have it.
?Whoa.
?Mark!
?Thank you, Mark.
Can we ask you
why you're out?
Nate and Tom have two offers
on the table
for their collapsible
foam?roller company Brazyn.
Lori and Sara have offered
$225,000 for a 20% stake.
And Kevin and Daymond have
offered $225,000 for 20%.
I'm gonna make one more
counter?proposal.
Would you do $250,000
for the 20%?
So, $25,000 more?
Why are you asking that?
Because ??
For a lot of reasons.
The cash is gonna help
our business,
and it's gonna help us
to grow the business.
Um, And it also ??
Kevin, you want to do that?
And we came in with the
valuation...
You want it?
...that's already been ??
So you want to bring that
to me and Sara.
Done. We'll do that deal.
We'll take that deal, okay?
?No, we'll do the deal!
?You'll do the deal?
?We'll do the deal.
?We'll take that!
We'll take that!
Hold on. We'll take that!
?Hold on.
?Not so fast, big guy.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Let's clarify.
?We are matching the offer.
Who are you offering that to ??
them or us?
?We matched the offer.
?We just matched that offer.
Can we step back
for a second?
?Just a moment?
?Guys...
You guys, we have ?? we have two
outstanding offers on the table.
Go ahead. Step back.
I think...
[ Whispering indistinctly ]
Kevin, fortunately you're
gonna be in your underwear
'cause you just got spanked.
[ Laughs ]
?Yay! Yay!
?Yes!
?Yay!
?[ Laughs ]
Congratulations, guys.
?So smart.
?So smart.
They have a patent pending
on it.
It fits the criteria of filling
the white space...
[ High pitched voice ]
It fits the criteria.
...which is something that
hasn't ?? Oh, my gosh!
Whoo!
[ Both laugh ]
What just happened.
Lawrie: Those are two powerful
businesswomen
who we respect a ton.
Having both of them onboard
is a dream come true.
