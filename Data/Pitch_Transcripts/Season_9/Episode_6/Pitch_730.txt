Hi, Sharks.
My name is Jennifer.
My name's Gifford.
And we're from Salem, Utah.
We're the inventors
of the DrainWig,
and we're here seeking
a $300,000 investment
in exchange for 5% equity
in our company.
Wow.
Whoa!
Boy!
?Whew!
?Sharks, we have a problem.
We actually
have five problems.
We have five daughters.
?[ Laughs ]
?Hmm.
Jennifer: It has a
stainless?steel chain
with colorful rubber whiskers
that trap the hair.
We have two
retail designs.
The DrainWig for the shower
has a cute flower cap,
and the DrainWig
for the bathtub
anchors to the side
of the tub with a suction cup,
which allows you to use
your stopper as usual.
Thank you, Sharks.
Our daughters
will now give each of you
samples of the DrainWig.
So, what did you do
in a previous life
that you got five daughters?
I don't know. It was destiny,
I gue?? For sure, destiny.
Hi! Thank you!
?This one's for Lori.
?Thank you very much.
?Ah, thank you!
?They're both for me.
Good job up there.
Greiner: How did you come up
with this idea?
Jennifer: So, what happened
was this invention
was a complete accident,
okay?
So, we're weirdos.
We floss and brush our teeth
in the shower.
[ Chuckles ]
And one day, I look down
in the drain
and there was something brown
and it was moving
and I was like, "Gifford,
there's a gopher in the drain!"
And I kid you not.
He pulled this cover off
and on the end of it
was this long piece
of dental floss
and on the end of it
was this massive wad of hair.
We were solving our problem,
and we were like,
"Hey, wait a second.
We ?? We could make a product
aft?? out of this."
What are you making it for,
and what are you selling it for?
It's ?? It's being made for
about $1.20 for the double pack.
What does the double pack
go for?
?Double pack goes for $9.99.
?$9.99.
Margins are excellent.
John: Where is this available
right now?
?Well, it's available ??
?All the big?box stores.
?All the big?box stores.
?Walmart.
?Walmart.
?Bed, Bath.
?Bed, Bath.
?It's everywhere?
?So you're well?distributed.
?Yes.
?We are.
O'Leary:
Just give me the numbers.
Okay, we've sold $14.2 million
in retail.
?Wow!
?Wow!
?Whoa!
?Wow!
That's a lot.
Greiner: Was this
an infomercial?
?Yes.
?Yes.
If you're everywhere
and you're really
doing great,
why are you here?
Why are you here?
Ha, ha, ha.
We thought you'd never ask.
We are so glad
you asked that question.
We went to trade shows.
Okay, we ?? we didn't know
anything about this industry,
and so one day,
I came home from a trade show.
A couple days later,
I got a phone call
from an
infomercial company.
?Did you do a deal with them?
?We did a deal with them.
We started selling.
They said,
"We're gonna pass you on
to the largest infomercial
company in America."
We've been in our agreement
for three years.
We've been issued $800,000
in royalty payments.
?That ?? In aggregate?
?In three years.
So is it a licensed deal
that you had
for three years
with this company?
?Yes.
?It is. We're in our third year.
?And does that run out?
?We gave them five years.
We've been splitting it,
and our deal with them
ends in March.
But if we renegotiate,
it would end immediately.
What I want to know is does
anybody else have equity?
We own everything.
We had an angel round
investor.
We paid them back
with the royalty.
We paid them back $300,000.
And ?? And ??
And so they're out.
They're out.
You told me that you've done
$14.2 million
in sales as a product.
It was done by an
infomercial company for you.
Yes.
Of that,
during the same period,
you collected $800,000,
which is around 5.4%.
?Right.
?The reason you're here
on the carpet at "Shark Tank"
is you want to get
the lion's share of this now.
?Absolutely.
?Yes.
?And you need a partner.
You're in a bad deal.
That's really what
this comes down to.
Thank you. You know what it
feels like to walk into Walmart?
I walk into Walmart, and I see
[voice breaking] my product,
and I haven't seen a dime.
We have ?? take all that money
'cause we take half of it
and pay it to
the first infomercial that ??
that brought us, and we ??
so we give half of it to them.
Our goal is to take
this product, form a company,
and take it to the market
and start making
the money ourselves.
So you want ??
you want my $300,000
to actually create a company
with ?? hire people...
?Yeah.
?...get warehouse space...
Get warehouse,
manufacturing logistics.
...getting logistics.
The motivation is clear now.
You want to take control
of your product. Right?
?Yes. Mm?hmm.
?Yes.
That's why you're here.
How are you going
to execute on that?
That's what I'm not sure about.
?Right.
So, we need your help
and resources.
That's a problem.
Look, I don't want
to make an investment
and then have to reinvent
your business for you.
I'm out.
O'Leary: I look at this
and say to myself,
"Okay, I give you $300,000
and start the journey with you.
5% doesn't even get me up
in the morning."
Not worth it.
So I got to get some skin
in the game here.
I do ?? I would do this deal
for 20%.
For me, that makes sense.
And I'd be willing
to do that right now
and go through all
of the headaches
that we're gonna have
'cause I'm not sure
these guys are gonna
roll over and say,
"Take the product away from us.
I was gonna make
$4 million on it.
I'm okay with that."
You're gonna need
a really nasty friend,
and I happen
to be that person.
?[ Laughs ]
?That's why we're here.
Yeah.
Listen, as ??
as an entrepreneur, like,
when I first started, I had a
really big company call me.
They took me to dinner.
They acted like
they wanted to buy me.
And then a month later,
they launched an $8 million
ad campaign with a girl
who looked exactly like me
wearing a knock?off product
of Spanx.
So all the sweat equity
you guys are putting into it,
I can't imagine how I would feel
if I knew that most of all
that sweat equity was having
to go to somebody else.
I own 100% of my company.
I think you can keep doing it
on your own.
And for that reason,
I'm ?? I'm out.
Okay.
5%'s not gonna get me up
in the morning,
but I like the product.
$300,000 for 20%.
?That sounds familiar.
?That sounds good.
And that's exactly
what his offer was.
Jennifer: Right.
I'm going to give you an offer
for $300,000, but for 25%.
Ooh!
Lori! Ouch.
Keeps on getting worse,
not better, doesn't it?
?I?I ?? It's ?? It's higher.
?That's much worse.
It's higher because retail
and infomercial
is my sweet spot.
It's an enormous job.
Would anybody be interested
in doing a deal
at $300,000
for 10%?
?At 10%?
?At 10%?
You're treating it like it's a?a
new product to the market.
Wait, I don't think you ??
I don't think
you heard what he said.
We gave you the offers.
Gifford.
That was insane.
That was crazy.
That was intense.
[ Cheering ]
?Wow!
?Did you hear?!
Did you hear it?
?Yeah.
Jennifer:
When I go into that Walmart now,
now I can walk in and say,
"That's ours.
We got it here.
And we worked our little
tails off to get here."
And we'll be able to see
the fruits of our labor.
Yeah!
[ All cheer ]
