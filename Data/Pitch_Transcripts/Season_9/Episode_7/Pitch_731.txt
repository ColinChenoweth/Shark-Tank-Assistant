My name is Dakota Decker.
Our company is
GeoOrbital.
We're from
Cambridge, Massachusetts.
We're seeking $500,000
for 5% of our company.
Sharks,
we give you the bicycle ??
effectively unchanged
for over 100 years.
Now, maybe it's just me.
Maybe I watch
too much science fiction,
but I want
to take the bicycle
Burtov:
You got to pedal backwards!
Decker: You got to pedal
backwards on that one!

Wow!
Here we go!
?Yeah, please.
?Yeah.
Anybody else want to try?
It's fun.
It's like magic!
