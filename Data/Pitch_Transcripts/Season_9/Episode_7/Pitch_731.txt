My name is Dakota Decker.
Our company is
GeoOrbital.
We're from
Cambridge, Massachusetts.
We're seeking $500,000
for 5% of our company.
Sharks,
we give you the bicycle ??
effectively unchanged
for over 100 years.
Now, maybe it's just me.
Maybe I watch
too much science fiction,
but I want
to take the bicycle
and introduce it
into the 21st century.
The GeoOrbital wheel is a step
into the future.
We made a way to turn almost
any bicycle electric
in under 60 seconds
with no tools.
So, what you see here is
a 100% normal bike,
exactly as you would buy
from a store,
completely unmodified.
All you do is take off
your regular front wheel,
put on the GeoOrbital wheel,
clip on the throttle,
and you're good
to go.
It takes under 60 seconds
to install...
and no tools.
Wow.
Now what you see here
is a powerful electric bike.
The motor will take you
about zero to 20 miles an hour
in under 10 seconds.
You can travel up to 20 miles
on a single charge
without even peddling.
You're going up a hill ??
no sweat.
You've got 500 watts
of power available
at the press of a lever.
So, can I try it?
Absolutely.
You can. Yeah, yeah.
Here, let me ??
I got another one
for you guys, too.
Okay, so,
what do I need to know?
Let me grab the helmet for you.
So, it's literally exactly like
you would ride any bicycle.
The pedals and brakes work
exactly the same.
Yeah.
The only difference is
this little button here.
Here, does somebody else
want to try?
Never wear a helmet
on television.
[ Chuckles ]
That's just ??
That's a blackmail photo
for the rest of your life.
Oh, yeah!
That is very cool!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, oh!
I'm gonna catch Kevin,
is what I'm gonna do.
Yeah, look at that!
Like riding a bike.
Yeah.
The blind
chasing the blind.
Oh, my God!
Where's the brake?!
Burtov:
You got to pedal backwards!
Decker: You got to pedal
backwards on that one!
[ Laughter ]
Wow!
Here we go!
?Yeah, please.
?Yeah.
Anybody else want to try?
It's fun.
It's like magic!
Are you at Kickstarter
and Indiegogo?
Burtov: We only actually
launched the company
about four months ago.
We raised $1.26 million
on Kickstarter.
Wow!
And after that,
we've been ??
we've had a little over $200,000
on our website
directly through residual media
and things like that.
And are you shipping
or still prototype?
We're gonna be shipping
in like two months.
We ?? Two months.
Greiner: I don't think
we know the price.
Corcoran: No, we don't.
?Did we ever hear the price?
?We skipped over that one, no.
What is the price?
It'll retail for $950.
Right now ??
$950 for the wheel?
For the wheel. Correct.
For the wheel, and...
Isn't it cheaper to buy
an electric bike?
It depends on the bike.
But you can get an electric bike
for under $950.
You can.
You can get an electric bike
for almost $500,
but it's the quality of the bike
that you're getting.
That's not a problem for you?
These are ??
We haven't seen that
a problem
with our ?? with our
pre?order customers.
Sacca: Is the market
opportunity for this
just the bikes
that are out there today
that don't have
electric yet?
We feel it's ??
There ?? There's a hurdle
to biking for people.
If I get anxious,
if I get on a bike,
regular bike,
I'll get tired.
I'm anxious
about going up hills.
I'll be anxious
about getting ??
sweating on my way to work,
right?
You don't have to sell us on
the promise of electric bikes.
I own a couple of them.
We're going in a direction
where all bikes that are shipped
ultimately are going to have
an electric option in them.
Would you ever
make a bike?
That's what I'm trying
to ask you.
Uh, I want to ?? I want to show
you something real fast.
We ?? We don't make
any bikes currently.
We made
something different.
[ Laughter ]
That is a cool bike!
I love the banana seat.
What've you got here?
Burtov:
This is how it works.
You just sit on it,
and it's the same thing.
It looks...
?I love that bike.
?It's very tight?turning.
You've got a nice,
tight turning radius.
There's is nothing ??
you cannot do anything like this
with any other technology.
So, this is also
something we sell.
And this is
a full electric bike.
That's a cool bike.
It's extremely nimble.
it's extremely small.
You can put it in the trunk of
your car.
Well, this bike ??
what's this bike cost?
You say you're selling them
for $950?
This is $200
in addition to the wheel.
Where are you prioritizing
your time?
On the new bike
or that wheel?
Oh, the bike is
a side note.
Oh, the bike is for fun.
To be honest,
that was the opposite
of the answer
I wanted to hear.
This is gonna be as fast
as last season's
Dallas Mavericks'
playoff?highlight reel.
Sacca:
I believe that ??
Can I just say,
that highlight reel you ??
Oh, wait, you don't have a team.
You don't have any highlights
of anything, do you?
[ Laughing ]
Corcoran: Oh, my gosh.
That's literally
your only comeback?
My gosh.
Is that I don't
own a basketball team?
Oh, that was a zinger.
I?I believe
in this space.
Electric bikes are here to stay.
There's no doubt about it.
I just really like
to invest
in the thing
that's forward?looking,
not the thing
that's retrofitted
to the existing
technology.
If you had told me
you were moving on this bike,
that I think,
as goofy as it looks right now,
is really innovative,
that would have gotten me
more excited.
I think there is
a good short?term opportunity
in retrofitting
existing bikes,
but I want to be betting
on the long?term
electric?native bikes.
And so for that reason,
I'm out.
Retrofitting current
to make it future is the future.
We're making electric vehicles
out of stuff
that's collecting dust
in your basement.
This is the future.
Cuban: One of the biggest
challenges,
having been
in multiple bike companies,
is sales
and distribution, right?
Inevitably,
there's an initial jump online.
You know,
you get that initial surge
that you're going through
right now.
But it's just such
a competitive environment.
It is just so hard
to compete to sell bikes
against the big?box retailers,
the small shops,
and all the different
alternatives.
It's just not a ??
a business I want to be in,
so for those reasons,
I'm out.
Thank you.
But let me also add,
as far as how we grow, right?
So, we're direct
to consumer now.
In the next two years,
we want to do a lot more fleet.
Delivery, services,
police,
tour guides,
bike shares...
Well, so does everybody.
So does everybody.
Every motorized vehicle...
But we ??
they don't need new bikes.
It's kind of ??
It's a good point.
Burtov: Police have
their current bikes.
Very good point.
Bike shares have
their current bikes.
At $950 a unit,
even significantly discounted,
that's gonna be
a big hurdle to overcome.
To me, there's three rules
to a great product.
Is it something
that people need and want?
Is it something
that solves a problem?
Which, clearly, it does.
Can it be made
at an affordable price?
You have number one.
You have number two.
Right now,
you don't have number three.
And for that reason,
sadly, I'm out.
Okay.
O'Leary: I live
in the back bay in Boston,
in a tiny brownstone
with a tiny elevator.
And that bike,
the little one, fits in it.
Great for elevators.
So, I'm gonna come over
and buy one,
but I think you need
another couple of iterations
to get the cost down.
I think it has to go
below $300.
Guys, I'm a buyer
of the small bike,
but not the company.
I'm out.
Okay.
You still have
one Shark left.
