My name is Jeff McNeil,
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Jeff McNeil.
Jeff, do you have
an example of the book?
Can we see samples?
Sure.
So, these are samples
of my own book
for my daughter, Annabel.
Here you go.
Awesome. Thanks.
Five?!
Five.
Five kids!
It's not five times
as hard as one.
[ Laughs ]
What are their ages?
Oldest is 8,
youngest is 1.
Oh, goodness.
Wow.
You've been
in the weeds forever.
No wonder
you look exhausted.
I have an amazing wife.
So...there's not a lot
on each page.
Do people customize it
to put as much as they want
on a page?
So, the book is
an auxiliary product for us.
That book is
effectively a prototype.
I'm gonna shock you
by saying
we've sold a total
of four books.
But, Jeff, how do you support
your family?
Jeff, you're one of these guys
who gets better as you talk.
But I like to make a difference
in my entrepreneurs.
I'm not sure how I could
help you on this.
So I'm out.
Jeff, when you first
walked in here,
you were boring me
to death.
I was already out.
But the more you talked,
the more interested I got.
I have a whole slew
of companies
that already have
your customers ??
Lovepop, Honeyfund,
Wicked Good Cupcakes.
All of these have
massive databases
of parents with kids.
So, I'm gonna make you
an offer, okay?
I'll do $350,000 for 20%.
Cuban: Jeff,
I'll clear the deck some.
Look,
I think it's a great product.
My ?? My only issue
with it is,
the minute you get
to a certain level
Jeff has an offer on the table
from Kevin
for his text?based
online journal company,
Qeepsake.
But his offer may get worse
now that all but one other Shark
has dropped out.
O'Leary:
The risk you've got is,
as the Sharks drop out,
it makes me greedier.
You don't do a deal
with somebody
just to get access
to their mailing list.
Kevin's old enough that
he needs memory aids,
Jeff: What's ?? So, the concern
is there's too much work.
Congrats, Jeff.
Thank you.
O'Leary: You know, he wasn't
gonna do a deal for 20%.
That's it.
It's that simple.
Yep.
I could've got him
another 200,000 users, easily.
He's a bozo.
He didn't think that through.
I honestly feel like
this was the best opportunity
that's ever stood
in front of the Sharks,
