My name is Jeff McNeil,
and I'm from
Newton, Massachusetts.
I live here with my wife,
Stephanie, and my five kids.
My background is in design.
I spent nine years
running my own
custom software design company.
I eventually
lost my passion for it,
and I wanted to get back
to my roots.
?All right, school's open.
?You guys have a great day.
?Love you, guys.
?Bye!
Love you. Bye, babes.
Hey, I don't get
a hug anymore?
With this many kids,
there's lots of big moments
and lots
of little moments, too,
but never enough time
to keep track of it all.
I decided to use my background
in technology
to solve this problem
for ourselves
and introduce it
to parents everywhere.
Within two days
of having the idea,
I had written up a spec,
I had two developers
working on it,
and we knew that
we had a million?dollar idea.
Okay, line up,
find your letter.
I'm nervous that I've put it all
on the line for this business.
I've got five mouths to feed,
five kids to clothe,
five kids
to put through college.
This is real.
With the Sharks' help,
I know that I can get my product
out to parents everywhere
so that they can treasure
their kids' special memories
forever.
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Jeff McNeil.
And I'm here today
from Newton, Massachusetts,
seeking $350,000
in exchange for 10% equity.
With my company, Qeepsake,
you'll never miss a memory.
Every parent
has one of these, right?
A baby book.
It's supposed to house
all your child's important
milestones, firsts,
and memorable moments.
But most of these books,
they look just like this ??
empty.
You started filling it out,
but you got busy.
So before you know it,
you can't go back
and recall the details
of when your son or daughter
learned to take
their first steps
or to ride a two?wheeler.
As parents,
we're busier than ever,
and this thing ?? it doesn't fit
into our lifestyle.
What if saving memories
and milestones
were as easy
as sending a text message?
Meet Qeepsake.
I'm a father
of five myself,
so I have tons of memories.
Five!
Let me save one about
my daughter Annabel right now.
I'll show you how easy this is,
Sharks.
So, Qeepsake has just texted me
an insightful question
about Annabel,
and all I have to do
is text back, and that's it.
I have a new memory stored
in the Qeepsake journal
for Annabel.
Oh, earlier today,
my son Owen ??
he lost
his second front tooth,
and I want to save that
to Qeepsake.
So I write a text...
and I attach a photo,
and I'm done.
On the website,
I can see all my entries ??
I can fix
the inevitable typos.
When you're ready,
you can order
the gorgeous Qeepsake book.
By investing in Qeepsake,
you're backing the best team
to become the leader
in this huge, untapped market.
Jeff, do you have
an example of the book?
Can we see samples?
Sure.
So, these are samples
of my own book
for my daughter, Annabel.
Here you go.
Awesome. Thanks.
Five?!
Five.
Five kids!
It's not five times
as hard as one.
[ Laughs ]
What are their ages?
Oldest is 8,
youngest is 1.
Oh, goodness.
Wow.
You've been
in the weeds forever.
No wonder
you look exhausted.
I have an amazing wife.
So...there's not a lot
on each page.
Do people customize it
to put as much as they want
on a page?
So, the book is
an auxiliary product for us.
That book is
effectively a prototype.
I'm gonna shock you
by saying
we've sold a total
of four books.
Four?
We ?? We think
there's a demand for books,
but it's not right now.
You know, this would've been
really great to have
when Barbara was a baby,
but they didn't have
?any film or photography then.
?[ Laughs ]
I might be able to do something
about that, Sharks.
Let me make this
more real for you.
Oh!
Corcoran: Oh, come on!
Aww!
?[ Laughs ]
?Boy, is she cute!
?Bar!
You can tell she's brilliant
just looking at her.
?[ Chuckling ] Whoa!
?Who's that?
Sacca: Wait.
O'Leary:
That's a good?looking guy.
That's you?
Greiner: Kevin!
Absolutely.
?[ Laughs ] Oh, my God.
?Kevin!
Sacca: Was that a wig?
Cuban: Kevin!
What a cutie.
?Wow.
?Oh, no.
?Who's that?
It's me, Barb.
That's what's up right there,
baby!
[ Laughter ]
?That is a stud in the making!
?That's nasty.
Sacca: Math club.
You never got smooshed
into a locker,
did you, Mark?
Yikes!
Corcoran:
Is that the cowboy?
Oh yeah, it is.
?All carbs, all the time.
?All carbs?
So, how much do I pay
for the app?
The business model is
on subscription,
and it's not an app.
It's a service that works
over text message.
Okay, what's
the subscription fee?
Cuban:
So, explain to us ??
explain to us
your membership options
and the cost for each.
Sure, so the...
average plan price is $40.
It goes up to $95.
Per annum.
Per year.
Right, per annum.
And we have over 40,000
activated users.
So, let me give you
a shocking number.
We're converting 16%
of our user base
to a paid subscription.
That's a high
conversion rate.
Why don't I just use Note,
attach a picture...
Right, or why don't you just use
Facebook or Instagram?
Sure.
You have a fair concern.
This is stuff that you ??
for Facebook or Instagram,
it doesn't belong there.
It's ?? It's over?sharing.
It's personal.
The real innovation is that
we're helping people
at prompting questions.
And Note doesn't know
how old your kids are.
Note doesn't work with you
to go, "Hey"...
Is ?? Is there any intelligence
to the questions,
or is it a standard list
that you send to everybody?
There's hundreds and hundreds
of Qeepsake questions.
They're all age?informed.
But, Jeff, how do you support
your family?
Great ?? Great question ??
So, first and foremost,
we're actually making money
with Qeepsake.
I'm now taking a salary.
Qeepsake has made over $250,000
in revenue in four months.
?Wow, that surprises me.
?That's impressive.
Jeff, you're one of these guys
who gets better as you talk.
But I like to make a difference
in my entrepreneurs.
I'm not sure how I could
help you on this.
So I'm out.
Jeff, when you first
walked in here,
you were boring me
to death.
I was already out.
But the more you talked,
the more interested I got.
I have a whole slew
of companies
that already have
your customers ??
Lovepop, Honeyfund,
Wicked Good Cupcakes.
All of these have
massive databases
of parents with kids.
So, I'm gonna make you
an offer, okay?
I'll do $350,000 for 20%.
Cuban: Jeff,
I'll clear the deck some.
Look,
I think it's a great product.
My ?? My only issue
with it is,
the minute you get
to a certain level
and you get
a lot of attention,
somebody's going to compete,
right?
Like you said,
there's no barriers to entry.
And that's gonna be the
challenge for you.
I am worried about that, Jeff,
I really am.
There's worries
in every business.
No, of course, yeah.
Every single business
has concerns.
There is.
And, look,
I?I just don't see
it ?? It's a business
I want to be in.
Um, so for those reasons,
I'm out.
I appreciate the feedback.
Thanks.
Problem is,
I'm not the right partner
to escalate this very rapidly
for you.
I'm out.
Thank you.
O'Leary:
You know what I'm thinking?
If you're not
taking my deal,
you're hoping that somebody
will do it for less equity.
The risk you've got is,
as the Sharks drop out,
it makes me greedier.
Jeff has an offer on the table
from Kevin
for his text?based
online journal company,
Qeepsake.
But his offer may get worse
now that all but one other Shark
has dropped out.
O'Leary:
The risk you've got is,
as the Sharks drop out,
it makes me greedier.
You don't do a deal
with somebody
just to get access
to their mailing list.
Kevin's old enough that
he needs memory aids,
and I really think this product
would be great for him.
Ask him a question today ??
That makes me unhappier!
[ Laughs ]
So, I don't like your deal,
and here's why.
20% doesn't leave enough
for future rounds.
You need to have me
and the other founders
thinking like owners
the whole time.
I'm gonna counter.
So, I came in
with $350,000 for 10%.
I'm gonna move the equity up
to 12%.
Look, let me tell you,
I think you're solving
a real problem,
and you're going about it
the right way.
Prompt?based daily questioning
is a great way
to get somebody
to create content.
I was frustrated to hear you
push back on Kevin's offer,
because that was the same offer
I was gonna make you.
And I know I bring more
to the table
for an app like this
than Kevin ever could.
Not a chance in hell.
Dude, what are ??
just mailing your e?mailing list
doesn't actually bring
everything that comes
with working with somebody
to build a product,
to build a strategy.
If you already have a customer,
if you have actually
got a parent,
and they're buying a service
already,
that's a much higher probability
of a sale.
Yeah.
I'm ?? I'm really proud
of your 10,000 buyers
over there.
Like, if I'm getting involved
in something,
we're gonna make it big,
and we're going to
millions and millions.
But in order to make this
compelling for me,
I would need to own the 20%
of the company.
That's what it would take
to get me excited
and working on
really developing this product.
That's what I do for a living,
is make products better.
And so, my offer is
the $350,000 for the 20%.
Appreciate the offer.
I'm gonna counter back ??
$350,000, 14%.
So first of all,
I'm deeply flattered
that you gave me a better price
than Mr. Wonderful
right out of the gate.
You gave him 2% better
than Kevin.
I'm gonna sleep well tonight
just knowing that.
Kevin, are you staying in?
Because it's ??
I'm in pain now,
waiting for you
to make your decision,
I'll make it easy
for you ??
I'm out.
Are you going down,
Chris?
Now, I...
Uh...
Jeff: What's ?? So, the concern
is there's too much work.
It's too risky
on the competitive landscape.
I don't know what
the competitive landscape is,
and you haven't convinced me
that it's clear.
Get me comfortable
that there's
nobody else out there
who's gonna come after you.
So I can't guarantee there's
nobody going after the space,
but I can guarantee that nobody
pops up on our radar
with this level
of traction.
Why do you win?
We win because we've done this
time and time again.
The market is there.
Everybody is there.
They're waiting
for the solution.
They don't know about it.
I want to work with you.
I can't do the 20% because it ??
it's too much dilution.
The valuation is
too low for us.
Well, you're sucking up
very well, I have to admit.
The question is,
will it save you any equity?
It's genuine.
Are you willing
to do it for less, Chris?
That's all.
You nailed that response,
but you still didn't
get me there.
I like your approach.
I think I could help you
make it a lot better.
But I got to dig in
at 20%.
That's what makes it
meaningful for me.
Under any circumstance,
you're not doing 20%?
I would 20% for more money.
[ Laughs ]
I came in here with
a 3.15 pre?money valuation.
I think it's very fair.
At a certain point,
you just have to make
the decision.
Corcoran: So,
what's your decision?
So, I will respectfully decline
the offer.
I appreciate the feedback
and the consideration.
Congrats, Jeff.
Thank you.
O'Leary: You know, he wasn't
gonna do a deal for 20%.
That's it.
It's that simple.
Yep.
I could've got him
another 200,000 users, easily.
He's a bozo.
He didn't think that through.
I honestly feel like
this was the best opportunity
that's ever stood
in front of the Sharks,
and they will sincerely regret
not getting a piece of it.
