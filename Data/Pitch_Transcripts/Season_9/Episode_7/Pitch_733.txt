Honig: What are you gonna do
with your hands
when you're
standing there?
Deutsch: You're going
like this?
I'll probably put them
in my pockets.
You can't do
in your pockets.
?Yeah, you can.
?Don't do pockets.
?Like this.
?No, no.
Whatever you do.
Side ?? Do side.
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Isaac Deutsch.
And I'm Zoli Honig.
And we're the founders
of WaiveCar.
We're here today asking
for $500,000
in exchange for 2%
of our company.
WaiveCar's the world's
first all?electric
and free
car?sharing service.
WaiveCar allows its users
to use our 100% electric cars
completely for free
for two hours at a time.
Now, before we get too far,
I know you're thinking it ??
"How the heck are these guys
making money?"
Well,
the answer is advertising.
To put it simply,
companies pay us to display ads,
and our customers contribute
by driving those ads around.
Each of our cars is equipped
with a vinyl advertising wrap,
as well as a military?grade,
dual?sided LCD display
that can display
dynamic ad content.
This means we can show ads
based on time, GPS location,
or really any other factors
that we choose.
Signing up to drive
with WaiveCar is really easy.
Just download our app,
sign in,
and you'll see all
of the available WaiveCars
on the map.
Just choose the one
that's closest to you,
and hit "reserve."
You know have an electric car
for free.
We launched in Los Angeles
five months ago
and have seen
tremendous growth.
Our problem now is,
we need more cars.
We would love to have
one of you Sharks join us
to rapidly expand our company
across the world.
This is WaiveCar,
the wave of the future.
Both: We waive the fee,
you drive for free.
You know, I'm amazed you said
"five months ago,"
because I have actually seen
WaiveCars in Santa Monica.
Yeah, our home base
is in Santa Monica.
We have 20 vehicles
driving around.
?So that's pretty fast.
?What happens after two hours?
Does it eject me
out of the driver's seat?
$5.99 an hour
after that.
Corcoran: Do you return it
to the same place
you picked it up?
No, so, right now,
you have to return it
in the city of Santa Monica.
Anywhere?
Any public meter.
Electric cars, you're
allowed to park
at any public meter
for free.
Yeah.
So, every time
you start a booking,
we require the users to do
a quick check
that the car's clean,
that there's no body damage...
What's your break?even
per car?
Well, so,
the cost of the car itself
is about $1,000 a month
with insurance and everything.
Our break?even will be
about $1,500.
Over that is profit.
We actually have done
zero dollars in marketing,
and we have 4,300 users
just in our
first five months.
Wow!
Look, it's got to be
capitally intensive, right?
So,
how much have you raised?
We raised $1.3 million.
When would you expect
to make a profit?
So, it really depends on the
amount of cars we have, right?
If we're selling out
our 20 cars right now
at $5,000 per car,
we'd be making about
$1.2 million in revenue.
We'd be walking away
with about $300,000 in profit.
Now,
those aren't great margins.
Once we move to 200 cars,
we'd be doing
$12 million in revenue,
so we'd be walking away
with $800,000?and?change profit.
Do you have guys have
some unfair advantage?
Are you better at something
than everybody else?
So, the screen
that we have on our cars,
a lot of people
kind of overlook.
"Oh, it's a screen.
Whatever."
This is actually
crazy custom?engineered
for this vehicle.
You can't slap this
on any other vehicle.
It has to be
safety? and crash?tested,
and the manufacturer
that has this
has over 200 patents
on the display.
And we have an
exclusive agreement with them.
Guys, look,
I like the idea.
I think you guys have
a chance at success.
But the challenge
for me is,
the variability of advertising
is crazy.
You know, it's hard for
traditional media companies
to sell advertising.
There's video boards
that are popping up
on top of hot?dog stands
in New York, right?
Yeah.
They're everywhere.
The inventory
is being saturated,
which hurts your rate.
The more you spend,
the more you need.
And, you know, that's gotten
a lot of industries in trouble.
And so for those reason,
I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mark.
You're welcome.
My concern is,
how do you stop Uber
or anybody else
from putting signage ??
wrapping their cars?
You talked about that
that's a proprietary sign,
but I'm sure that somebody
can figure out
another kind of sign
to put on top of a car.
I'm concerned that other people
can take your model,
and for that reason,
I'm out.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
How many advertisers
do you have?
So, we're only
five months old,
so we really haven't
even started
the sales process
of building...
Do you have
any advertisers?
So, we have
Oscar Health Insurance.
Are they the only guys
you've got so far?
No, we have
another advertiser ?? uh, XYZ.
You guys are
really embryonic.
I like the idea, but, boy,
there's just no track record.
Sacca: Guys, you're
in the advertising business,
but so far,
you have two advertisers.
You don't really
have any proprietary tech.
You're an integrator
that doesn't really control
any leg of the stool here.
More companies have raised
more billions of dollars
in this space
than ever before ??
Uber and Lyft in terms
of ride sharing.
But the
number?one challenge
those services are encountering
right now
is finding more drivers
and more cars.
And that's exactly
the problem.
That's exactly the problem.
That's why we're doing this.
Right now ??
So, for Uber ??
What's Uber's biggest ??
What you're doing is,
you're doing their R&amp;D for them.
But what's
Uber's biggest problem?
You're figuring it out.
You right now are running
this incredible experiment.
And Uber's watching you,
and they're saying,
"Hey, is this thing
gonna work?"
But let me ask you
a question.
Why doesn't Uber advertise
right now?
Because they're gonna let you
blow all the money
and figure out
if it works or not.
[ Laughs ]
You really think so?
Or they'll ??
Or they'll allow us
to ?? to give their drivers
free cars.
That's what we would
love to do.
Uber has an ad sales force
right now
that's bigger
than your company.
You're right.
Uber has a fleet that's
much bigger than your company.
But you like to get in early.
That's your shtick.
And they didn't pay any money
for those cars.
They don't own any of them.
We'll own them.
You guys ??
They don't have to own them.
[ Chuckles ] See, that's ??
That's why there's one company
that's worth $63 billion
and another one that's not,
right?
No,
but we're a third party.
I've yet to hear you say
you're bringing anything
to the party...
We're a third party.
...that you do better than
anything else on the planet
other than attach that
to that.
And we have
the ability to ??
And that is not
worth millions of dollars.
I don't think there's any way
you guys survive this,
because I have yet to see
anything you do better
than anybody else
on the planet.
At the end of the day,
I'm canceling the ride.
I'm out.
O'Leary: Let me
make you an offer, okay?
I think you've already heard
what Sacca says ??
that you have nothing
that anybody else
can't just emulate
and crush you
after you've proven
that it works.
That's a concern
for any investor.
Secondly, I know a lot
about the advertising business
because I spend
a lot in it.
I'm the financial service
industry.
I'm buying ads off everybody
all the time.
I don't know
if this is gonna work or not.
So, that's another risk.
The only way I would
do this deal is this way.
I will loan you $500,000
at 12%.
It's a 36?month loan,
number one.
Number two,
I want 4% of your equity
just for that loan.
In addition to that,
I want any unsold
digital advertising.
That's the only way
I would do this deal,
given I've got two huge risks.
Well, what are you gonna
pay us for those unused,
unsold slots?
Nothing. It's unused.
So, you want the free
advertising here.
So you want 4%
of the company ??
It's your rem??
it's remnant inventory.
It's remnant.
You don't have ??
But the remnant inventory
right now,
and we're gonna make money
from that...
If ?? If it gets sold
for anything,
then I don't get it, okay?
Why don't
you counter him?
Look, that's ??
that's what I'm willing to do.
Before you counter him,
I'm gonna make you
a different deal.
Honig: When you walk
into the Tank,
you're gonna get a lot
of criticism.
I know this company
is gonna be huge,
and I'm gonna do
whatever it takes
to make it huge.
And if you don't have
that kind
of blood, sweat, and tears
going into your business,
then entrepreneurship
is not for you.
