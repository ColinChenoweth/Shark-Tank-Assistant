Hi, Sharks.
I am Desiree Vargas Wrigley.
Hey, Desiree, you know,
I, in the spring of 2000,
lost every dime I had
plus $2.125 million more,
leaving me completely
in the hole with no assets.
I was picking up spare work
off of Craigslist
You have one Shark left,
Desiree ?? Mark Cuban.
And he's got more billions
than that guy,
so you're lucky.
