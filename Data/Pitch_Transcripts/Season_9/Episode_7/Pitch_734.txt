Hi, Sharks.
I am Desiree Vargas Wrigley.
And I am CEO and founder
of Pearachute,
and I'm here today asking
for $500,000
in exchange
for 6% of our company.
Sharks, our company is
gonna change the way that
parents and children discover,
share, learn, and play.
See, as parents of kids under 5,
we have a dilemma.
We want to introduce our kids
to things that they're going
to love,
like soccer, art,
swimming, music.
So we sign them up
for 12 sessions of art,
but by the third visit,
your 2?year?old is
in the corner crying or refusing
to get into the water,
and you still have
nine sessions left
that you cannot get refunded.
Millions is wasted
on unattended classes
because of things like
changing nap schedules
and surprise visits
from Grandma.
This is why we created
Pearachute.
Pearachute is
a monthly?membership club
that makes it easy
for parents and caregivers
to discover, book, and drop
into the best kids' activities
in your city.
Let me show you how it works.
So, parents come to
the Pearachute kids' website,
and they can immediately
begin searching
from thousands of classes
all over the city.
They can also filter
by age and interests.
They simply select a class,
click "drop in,"
decide which child will attend,
and they're all set.
It's that simple,
all from your phone.
And because we're parents,
we know that things come up,
so we let people cancel up
to one hour before
without a penalty.
And our partners love us because
we fill classes,
and we bring revenue.
So, Sharks, who's ready to drop
into the best new business
to inspire curious
and courageous kids?
What does it cost
to subscribe?
We initially launched
126 days ago
with two plans ??
a five?pack and an unlimited.
And we launched
the five?pack at $79
and unlimited at $99.
So, you say
you're only 126 days old.
Yeah, we're young.
Okay, so,
then give us some history
and tell us what
you've accomplished so far.
Yeah, so, I am a parent
of two little boys.
I have a 4 1/2?year?old
and a 2?year?old.
And then, I'm also a stepmom
to a 10 1/2?year?old.
So, I found that
when we had Griffin and Aiden
that I would sign them up
for classes.
And Griffin we signed up
for soccer at first,
but then, after a few sessions,
he just got sick of it.
He was playing
on the bouncy things.
He just wasn't going.
So, I realized there
that there was a problem.
And then we also ??
I mean, I can do everything
else from my phone.
So, that was really
the desire.
And I have done this before.
This is not my first business.
Greiner: What was
your first business?
My first company is a company
called GiveForward,
and it was one of the first
crowdfunding sites in the world.
I took that company
to $5 million a year in revenue
and raised about $6 million.
That's great.
And what happened to it?
It's still going.
Do you still own equity
in it?
I do.
Are you involved
in managing it?
I'm not involved
in managing the business.
So, is it...
I'm exclusively on Pearachute
right now.
But it's not growing anymore,
is it?
It's actually doing
really well,
and it's pivoted
into a new market because ??
you know what I learned
from the experience there,
which honestly, I think,
a benefit to you all,
is that I spent eight years
learning on someone else's dime
what I can now accelerate
into this business.
I want to know,
did you get whacked?
I ?? The truth is that
I watched a competitor
just blow past us,
and I realized
that the founder vision
that I brought only took ??
had so much value at that point,
and it was time for me
to exit the business.
So, I found a CEO that was
a great operator
and brought him in,
and I handed over
a very healthy business.
Good for you.
Thank you.
?I know it's only 126 days...
?Yes.
...but how much money
have you made?
So, to date,
we've made just under $50,000
in 126 days and ??
And how many subscribers
do you have?
We have over 600.
What was your revenue
last month?
The ?? In the last four weeks,
it's been $20,000.
Tell me how your software
interacts
with all these
different classrooms.
How do you know
about their inventory ??
what classes are available
and what's not available?
So we launched
with 30 partners.
We created a very light portal
for them
that's actually
mobile?friendly
so their instructors,
when they're on a soccer field
or in front
of a swimming pool,
can check kids in
and adjust inventory real?time.
So, they can say,
"Four people canceled
for our art class today.
Let's put four more spots
on Pearachute today."
O'Leary:
What cities are you in?
We're only in Chicago right now,
so...
That's it?
When you look
at what this is
in terms of a vision
for this business,
there is 75 million Millennials
right now
that are going to have
another 75 million children...
I agree. I agree.
...over the next 20 years.
80% of them care more
about experiences
than they do about things.
But tell me how
you're gonna expand it.
I get it. I get it.
How 'bout New York?
No, so the demand is...
How 'bout Dallas?
How 'bout Miami?
What's happening in ??
Yeah, so,
Dallas is actually next.
We've already gone out...
But how do you do that?
How do you do that?
So ??
How do you do it
before somebody else does it?
So, Dallas ??
what we're so excited about is
the fact that there's
a really high concentration
of kids' activities centers
in North Dallas.
But what's missing,
and I'm still waiting for it,
and you better
get to it because
why are you going
to own this space?
What ??
What are you going to do
to create
the number one platform?
Why are you gonna be the winner
at the end of the day?
Why are you gonna grow?
We do plan to take
a similar model
that we took to Chicago
and put it in
the next big cities
that we think are
a great opportunity.
I asked you to tell me
how I pour gasoline
in the form of my money
onto your fire
to expand this business.
I want to know what the path is
to get every other city,
and you never answered me.
I asked you to tell me
how I pour gasoline
in the form of my money
onto your fire
to expand this business.
I want to know what the path is
to get every other city,
and you never answered me.
So, the...
That's a huge fail on your part.
I'm sorry.
I really ?? I really think that
when you have the opportunity ??
I'm sorry if
I didn't give you ??
And you speak very quickly.
Let me finish, okay?
[ Laughs ]
All right?
?Yeah.
I'm out.
Sacca: Is there something
you're better at
than everybody else?
I think my differentiator
is, honestly,
losing to a competitor
in my last business.
Watching some??
That's it?
Watching someone else
accelerate past me
and realizing all the missteps
I'd made over eight years
when I could've done it
so much faster,
so much more aggressively.,
Do you mind if I review
that history a minute?
'Cause I feel like I'm not
quite sure I got it.
Sure.
I'm gonna tell you what I've
been hearing here.
Okay.
You started StepForward.
GiveForward.
But when the going got tough,
you exited.
That's not what I heard.
Whoa, whoa. I'm just ??
you can correct me.
I just want to recite
the history.
Yeah, no, that's fair.
You know what
really concerns me?
It concerns me
what you said earlier,
when you said,
"The best part is
that I learned
on someone else's money."
I feel like you are probably
a phenomenal facilitator.
I just don't think
you're an entrepreneur.
I don't see you
as a killer.
I have never heard that before,
and I have to tell you.
You have to show me ??
Yeah. Yeah.
Maybe some of my life history
will help shed some light
on how I am absolutely gritty
and driven.
So, I was born
in Costa Rica.
I grew up with a single mom
who didn't go to college,
and she said, "Your life is
only gonna be different
if you work your butt off,"
and so, that's what I did.
And I worked my butt off
to get a scholarship
to a private school,
and I ??
Sorry.
[ Chuckles, clears throat ]
This is important ??
tell us.
I wasn't expecting this to be
the challenge, sorry.
I went to Yale,
and I worked my butt off there.
And I realized at Yale
that it wasn't enough
to go to be a lawyer
or an investment banker.
I ?? If I'm gonna do something
powerful in this life,
I need to do things
that matter.
GiveForward
wasn't just like a,
"Oh, wouldn't it be nice
if this exists?"
It was, there is a pain point,
and there's a desire for people
to give individually to people,
and that does not exist.
And I?I beat down so many doors
with this idea,
and I fought as hard as I could
to make it go well.
But at the end of the day,
I thought,
"Maybe someone else can do this
better than I can."
But there's a point always
along the way
in building a business
where the chips are down,
nothing's going right,
and it's so tempting
to switch horses.
I think
there's going to be
a learning curve
on this business, as well,
and I don't want you learning
on my dime.
I'm out.
I like the idea.
But, to me,
my concern here is
I feel like you're biting off
a little bit more
than you're gonna be able
to chew.
I would say, get this
grounded better in Chicago.
Then, set your sights
moving on to Dallas.
I wish you the best.
I'm out.
Hey, Desiree, you know,
I, in the spring of 2000,
lost every dime I had
plus $2.125 million more,
leaving me completely
in the hole with no assets.
I was picking up spare work
off of Craigslist
to try and make rent
so I could stay in the game.
And it took me more than
a decade to get up the courage
to talk about that setback
along the way.
I was listening to you
tell your story
about being born
to a single mother in Costa Rica
and how you fought your way up
through the system to Yale,
et cetera.
Your whole demeanor changed
as an entrepreneur.
You found
a confidence in that.
Instead of coming out here
and asking for money,
I saw this whole shift
where you were giving the Sharks
an opportunity to invest
in your business.
Keep that in mind.
Own your journey ??
own what you've learned
and why it makes you
so much more powerful
and why it's equipped you
to be unfairly advantaged
in this business
to win it.
If you search hard enough
in California on any given day,
you're gonna see me
in a Music Together class
with my three kids
under 5.
I will be there
singing full?voice,
playing a recorder,
banging on a wood block.
This is my life.
I do this.
But this is
a hard product.
You're building
a two?sided marketplace
where there has to be
enough demand on the user side
and enough supply
on the other side.
And the reality for me is
if I'm not jumping in,
I'm jumping out.
These deals for me,
I have to have my whole gut in,
or I'm out.
And so,
I hope you prove me wrong,
but on this one,
I'm out.
Okay,
thank you for the opportunity.
You have one Shark left,
Desiree ?? Mark Cuban.
And he's got more billions
than that guy,
so you're lucky.
And you'll have experience,
and we're coming
to your hometown.
The big question...
is equity.
Yeah.
But to make it work ??
I'm not gonna have...
I mean, let's get
that number on the table.
[ Greiner chuckles ]
Mark, give her a number!
Shut up, Kevin.
I'm gonna ask for 20%
of the company.
But with the 20%,
then I can go to work for you.
You're gonna be counting on me.
?Yeah.
I'm gonna give you
office space in Dallas.
I'm gonna have
a foundation of people
for you to work with that'll
accelerate you even more.
Okay.
Considering the traction there
that you have,
the tech
they've already built,
I actually think
that might make sense for you.
Oh, well,
he's really anxious to hear
that you think his deal
makes sense.
Aren't you, Mark?
Yep.
There's one tech investor
up here on the panel, and...
[ Laughs ]
Just one, right, Chris?
Uh?huh. I just want to coach you
through this one a little bit,
let you know
how you're doing.
I appreciate that.
What are you gonna do?
I absolutely want
to get there with you,
and I'm wondering if
you'd be willing to come up
just a little bit
on the valuation.
Here's what I'll do.
I'll give you $500,000
for 15%.
