Hi, Sharks.
My name is Jennifer.
And I'm Gita.
We're from Los Angeles,
California,
and our company
is called No Mo?Stache.
We are seeking $100,000
for 25% equity.
No Mo?Stache is revolutionizing
every woman's beauty routine.
Ladies, have you
ever been driving
to an important business
meeting, and...
Both: Aah!
...notice a glistening, hairy
lip in the rearview mirror?
Or what about you,
busy moms,
juggling a million
things at once,
and when you finally get a
chance to look in the mirror...
Both: Aah!
...you need a wax!
No Mo?Stache has all of these
hairy situations handled.
They are mess?free
cold?wax strips,
so there is no risk of burning
your skin with hot, gooey wax.
Curious how it works?
We thought you would be.
So first, rub the strip in your
hands to heat the wax up.
It's that easy.
Then pull the strip apart
and apply it
to the side of your face.
Rub back and forth for hair
to adhere to the wax.
Hold skin taut,
and pull opposite
of hair growth.
?Aah!
Herjavec:
She's not smiling anymore.
Frankel: She's smiling!
She's smiling.
No Mo?Stache is the only
waxing kit on the market
that is packaged
for your convenience
in a small, discreet tin,
giving you the freedom
to wax any time, any place.
Throw a No?Mo in your bag,
and always be prepared.
When you have No Mo?Stache,
you have no mo' worries.
Both: So, Sharks, who's ready
to get in with smooth skin?
?I need to ask a very ??
?Do we get samples?
I need to ask a very,
very important question.
We have some samples.
If you get
that extra hair,
why don't you just
shave like the rest of us?
?What?!
?Oh, no!
You take a little razor
and go badabing, badaboom,
and it's gone.
?No, it would grow in.
It would grow in.
You would have a Chia Pet
on your lip
by a week from Tuesday.
?No.
Have you ever tried it?
Then you don't know.
?Excuse my ignorance.
?Uh?huh.
Is this that big a problem?
Is there that many women
that have mustaches?
?Oh, my God.
?Everybody has a mustache.
?Everybody.
?Really?
Let me ask you a question.
What's the difference between
this and the Sally Hansen strips
that you carry in your purse?
Perfect,
perfect example.
You could carry it
in your purse,
and somebody could see it
when you open up your bag.
And then they'll be
like, "Girl, why do you
have the Sally Hansens?"
Sorry, I don't know what
a Sally Hansen strip is.
It's the waxing people.
They have a business
of hair removal.
A bunch of people do.
?Yeah, they're beauty ??
But this is a tin.
Their concept here
is discretion.
This is a tin. It's like putting
a tampon in a single container.
There's nothing
proprietary about this?
?No.
?No.
It is the only portable
waxing kit on the market.
Is it patented in some way?
No. You can't
patent the tin.
So what are
you bringing here?
What do you've got
that worth anything?
?I have no idea.
?It's portable.
It's portable.
I have 14 years of waxing
experience as a beautician.
?That's worth $400,000?
?The proof is in the sales.
Right?
?The proof is in the sales.
Tell us what it costs you
to make, what you sell it for,
where you sell it,
and how much you've sold.
Our cost of goods
is $1.74 landed.
?The whole kit.
?The whole kit sent here.
We've done $400,000
in sales...
?What?!
?Cuban: There you go.
...in two years, yeah.
How much this year
are you going to do?
$300,000 this year.
Last year we sold ??
?What does it sell for?
I'm sorry.
?It's $18 retail.
That one little tin is $18?
?It's 12 wax services.
?12 wax strips.
So there you go, Bethenny.
?Listen.
?Ba?bam!
I really do think
this is a gimmick.
It's what you buy on the way out
of, like, the lingerie store.
?It's a $400,000 gimmick.
?So, wait.
So where are you selling it?
?I don't get it.
So, we're currently
selling at Sephora.
We're in the checkout
beauty on the go, in the bins,
the impulse bins.
?Wow.
?That's beautiful.
?Yes.
Cuban: Gita, how did you
get in there?
So, we got our product
in Real Simple magazine.
And then one day, our e?mail
just kept going bonkers.
And I'm like,
"What is going on?"
And just order after
order after order.
And yet, there's nothing
proprietary but what's in here.
But you know what?
Convenience sells.
There's nothing proprietary
about water, either.
?Yes.
?Are you in every Sephora?
?No, we're in 60 Sephoras.
?No, we're not.
?60. How many are there, total?
?Yes.
?Remind me.
?200.
?Can you get the other stores?
?Why do you think
they haven't
taken you into the others?
Originally, we were in the other
stores, in 200 stores.
And now we're in 60 stores.
?Okay.
?They reduced?
So the sales weren't good
in some of those places?
Actually, that's not true.
Every single week,
the sales were consistent.
?Then why?
They wanted to bring ??
make room for new trends.
That happens, right?
They roll through things.
?Yeah, it's ??
?Well, so that's a little bit
of a concern
'cause this may not be ??
If it was selling really
well, they would've kept it.
Right?
?I mean ??
It's hard to defend the fact
that you lost 140 stores.
That's what basically
happened, right?
Yes.
But I've had so many products
that have gone into all doors,
and then they do take it down ??
?Well, tell me why ??
Tell me why
that's exciting news.
Well, what's exciting news
is that since then,
we have been pushing
the pedal to the metal
to not have all
of our eggs in one basket.
?In the Sephora basket.
?Both: Exactly.
That's it.
So basically, it's a marketing
play on an old commodity.
And you've done a good job in
getting some shelf space for it.
Hopefully, you're going
to diversify your sales
outside of just
one distributor.
Yes.
We are launching with five
more distributors in September.
Oh, it came off.
It did.
I want to say
something positive.
I just waxed Mark's arm,
which I never thought
I'd say in this lifetime.
?You did?
So, all the competitors
that I have used in the past,
they are very sticky.
They get gooey.
They get all over everything.
?Yeah.
They're still on there later,
and you're feeling it.
I just waxed his arm,
and it's very neat.
Now that Mark has been waxed,
that changes everything.
So I'm going to
make you an offer.
?Yeah.
?You ready?
You're asking $100,000 for 25%.
You're very lucky
to be here today.
I might say that, too.
?Yeah.
Because I'm willing to give you
the $100,000 for 10%.
Wow.
But the way you're
going to pay me back
is I'm going
to get $1 a lip.
That's the way I like
to look at it.
?A lip?
?A dollar a lip?
Every time you sell
one of these ??
Excuse me, silence
while I get the offer out.
I'm going to give you
$100,000 for 10% equity.
But every time you sell
one of these,
I get $1
until I receive $300,000 back.
And then, it goes away.
I don't normally say this,
but that's a good deal.
That's not a bad offer,
shockingly.
It actually is a great offer.
Here's the thing.
I have thought about ??
You're very attached
to the name.
I think it very much
limits you to only hair removal.
And I've thought that there
needs to be a kit for women
that has nipple covers...
?Yes.
...your sticky tape,
your hair removal thing.
?Yes.
?This is one little gimmick.
No disrespect. This is going to
go away in a minute.
No.
How large is
the nipple?cover market?
The nipple ??
I have a female audience.
I have thought that places
like Sephora need a girl's kit.
Yes.
A whole kit with
all of these things.
So...
?I need to own that market.
...you are asking
$100,000 for 25%.
I would give you
$100,000 for 40%.
?Oh.
?But you have me.
?Oh!
?Oh.
And we're going to create
a brand of fashion...
All of a sudden,
there's no headlights!
...and beauty of a kit
for women.
A Skinnygirl solutions kit.
This is one little product.
I ?? There's a million types
of hair removal.
That's savage.
You're going to be dead
in the water.
You had one retailer, and you
already reduced by 140 stores.
You need to do
a female solution.
You have to re?brand it
under Bethenny's name.
?40%?
?Yeah!
You must be kidding.
?It's 40% of something.
Narrator:
All Sharks are still in.
Jennifer and Gita have
two offers on the table
from Kevin and Bethenny
for their hair?removal kit,
No Mo?Stache.
But Bethenny's offer
would require them
to re?brand their product
under Bethenny's
Skinnygirl brand.
Ladies, do you want to go
down that direction?
Do you want to give up
your company under her brand?
You don't want to build
somebody else's business.
You do not.
You want to build
your business.
You do not.
You have a great idea here.
I don't think that's a bad
idea, actually.
Whoa!
It's a very competitive space.
So, I was sitting here ??
You could sell it on QVC!
You could come in with me.
No one has put it together
in a compact way.
You're going away
for a girls' weekend.
You're going to a wedding.
You don't know what's
going to happen, not
until you get dressed.
?It's like your emergency kit.
?If your strapless dress
is falling down ??
Yes.
?You have made an offer for 40%.
?To help a woman in a pinch.
All right, what are you
doing, Lori?
?I kind of like this idea...
?What are you doing?
...because I think
that we could sell it.
Me too.
So where were you at,
$100,000 for 40%?
?Yes.
?Oh, savage!
?That is savage.
?That's crazy!
What are you
going to do with ??
?Listen, listen!
?I am absolutely the person.
?The two of us ??
?And you're allowed to counter.
?That's savage, savage.
?We're allowed to counter.
?Don't do that deal.
?You've got us, though,
two power bitches.
?Savage?
Jennifer, let me
ask you a question.
I just want to be clear.
Bethenny's offer is she wants
to re?brand your company...
?Mm?hmm.
?...under her company name.
Or ?? Or what Lori and I decide
together, if we're partners.
I don't have a problem with
the individual items' names.
I think they're cute.
No. By the way ??
Good point ??
That SKU should have that
name, and the others, too.
And No Mo?Bad Breath,
or whatever you want
to come up with.
You guys can be creative.
?I like that.
?No Mo?Bad Breath.
?Whatever, but the whole kit
is called something
that we come up with.
So No?Mo everything.
Listen, ladies.
?You don't have to re??
?No Mo?Blister.
No Mo?Stache, No Mo?Mark.
I'm out.
I can get access to a Chihuahua
with no hair,
and we could stick it
right on the tin.
You won't
have to pay anything.
Wait, hold on.
Okay, I'm changing something.
Aah!
We could call the whole brand
No?Mo, but it's no more,
and you figure out
what all the problems are.
Yeah.
No Mo?Nipple,
No Mo?Panty Lines.
?We have a lot of those, too.
?Honestly, I love this.
So it's your brand,
but it's our solution.
I don't want you to do all this.
I just want to give you money.
?I love the No?Mo name.
?I like the No?Mo name, too.
The No?Mo name
is really clever.
As much as profit
is genderless,
I just feel like this is
a brand to empower women.
And I feel like you guys
get the vision.
Wait a minute.
So our counter would
be then, 35%.
Two Sharks, 35%.
Well, you guys came in
at $100,000 for 25%, right?
Mm?hmm.
Which tells me that
you really want partners.
What you get along with us is a
lot of credibility and branding.
Why do so much?
But you couldn't have
better partners.
I'm only asking for 10%.
Let me make it even
more interesting for you.
I'll drop my royalty
down to 75 cents.
You can't get into
business with him.
You could not pick two
better women.
Absolutely. You do not have to
give up that much equity.
?What was your counter?
?It's a lot of equity.
If you would be willing to do
a deal where we'd stay back
to the 25% equity,
and then there was a royalty,
we'd be open to that, as well.
We just have
our hearts set.
Okay, I'm going to make it
more interesting
'cause I want to squeeze
their heads a little bit.
I'm going to drop my royalty
down to 50 cents, okay?
Not $1 anymore, it's 50 cents.
?Ooh!
And I'm only taking 10%
of the company.
Forget these guys.
What are you waiting for?
Let's do the deal.
?Okay, we're being creative.
?Okay.
We'll go to the 35%,
Bethenny and I,
$100,000 with a $1 royalty...
?O'Leary: Oh, that's outrageous!
?...that we'll split,
that we'll split...
?It's already down to 50 cents.
...on each kit of
No?Mo everything
until we get our money back,
and then, we'll cut the royalty.
My deal's way better,
way better.
You do deals like
that all the time.
You're giving up
too much equity.
If this works, you've given
away your company now.
