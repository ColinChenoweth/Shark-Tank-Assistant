Hello, Sharks!
I'm Mike.
And I'm Amy.
And this is
10?month?old Emmett.
We are here from Albany,
Oregon, seeking $85,000
in exchange for 10% equity
in our company, SnoofyBee.
We're the parents
to five kids.
?Oh, what?
?Five kids, yes.
My favorite thing
about being a dad
is watching that
beautiful curiosity
my kids have for
the world around them.
But unfortunately, there's no
off switch for that curiosity
when you have a really
nasty diaper to change.
Those cute little hands, they
can start reaching and grabbing
at the absolute
worst times.
And that's how we came up with
the clean?hands changing pad.
Our portable changing station
is the first of its kind
to gently redirect
your child's curiosity,
keeping their hands
happily away from the mess.
You can hang toys from the sides
to make diaper time extra fun.
?Clever.
?Or...
?Smart.
?Yeah.
...you can lay it flat
like a large, traditional
changing pad.
It has a foam pillow inside
so it's comfortable
to use anywhere,
and its water?resistant surface
wipes clean in seconds.
So, Sharks,
with your expertise
and a little bit
of your capital,
we can get the Clean Hands
Changing Pad
on the shelves
across the world.
Do we get samples?
?Yes!
?Exactly.
?We'll take the baby.
?All right.
So, Emmett's going to help
pass out these things.
Good job, Emmett.
?He's cute.
?Aww.
?Hi!
?He's a shy guy.
He loves people
from a distance,
but he gets a little shy
sometimes up close.
?Hello!
?Oh!
Robert, go ahead
and change his diaper.
All right, we'll pass
the baby down.
We'll pass the baby along.
Thank you.
?There you go.
?Oh, thank you.
?Hey!
?Oh, my God.
I want to take the baby.
You all ?? You have five.
You could spare one.
?Oh, wait.
?Lori's scaring the baby.
Aww!
Hey, no worries.
Well, it actually
is his nap time.
?Aww.
?It is.
Kevin's, too,
but we keep him up.
Well, he's been
awesome so far.
But we're going to pass him
out to Grandma
'cause we don't want
to push our luck.
?Not today.
?I'll be right back.
?Bye!
?Bye, Emmett.
So, Sharks, which one of you
wants to join us
to turn stressful,
messy diaper time
into fun, clean play time
for babies everywhere?
It's really clever.
I've never seen anything that...
What's proprietary here?
We're patent?pending
on the ??
We call it the
redirection barrier,
that goes around the child
as you're changing him.
So utility patent?
Yeah, we have
a utility patent pending.
When do you think
you'll get it?
It'll probably still be
another year or so.
Wow.
Guys, can you tell us
your background?
So, we have no, like,
business experience.
I sold shampoo
before I met him.
I was in sales
for nine years.
Yeah.
What were you selling?
What did you sell?
What did you sell?
I was selling
freight logistics.
What made you want
to start the business?
Well, when we had
this idea,
we made a rough prototype
for one of our sons.
And we took it out
at a party one day,
and we got a lot
of reaction from people.
We were just changing our
own kid's diaper.
So we did
an initial test run.
We saw there was
good reaction from people,
so we launched
on Kickstarter.
We had a huge success there.
?How much were you asking?
How much did you ask for,
how much did you get?
We were asking for 10,000.
We got 120,000.
?Wow.
?Wow.
You sold 120,000
on Kickstarter.
?Yeah.
?Did you ship all that?
So ?? So, that's
a very interesting story.
Do you want to take that,
Amy?
Sure.
So, we got 10,000 units in
and we opened up
our containers,
and that's when we realized
30% is not finished.
Where was it being
manufactured?
?Oh, my God.
?It was overseas.
But what happened next?
'Cause the key is
what you did next.
So, that's when
I actually quit my job.
We have
a 1,500?square?foot house.
We...
There was six people
living in it at a time,
and I was pregnant
with our son.
?Wow.
?We overhauled our house.
Yeah.
We got a bunch of friends
and family to inspect,
and we hired
some people to sew.
So, what do you want to do
with this product?
What's the plan with ?? If I
give you the $85,000 ??
Well, how 'bout what have they
been doing with the product?
What have you sold,
and where are you selling it?
All right. So, we've been doing
this for just about two years,
and our total sales
are $700,000 in revenue.
?Whoa!
?Wow.
?$700,000?
?That's great.
?What have you done ??
?And raising five kids.
What have you done
this year to date?
So, our first year
we did $140,000.
Last year,
we did $400,000.
This year, we're projected
to hit over $650,000.
Where did you sell that?
We sold that online on our
own website and on Amazon.
Have you tried
any retailers?
So, we're planning on going
to the baby show...
You haven't ever
been there before?
We haven't ??
We haven't visited there yet.
Wow.
You're doing $700,000,
and you've hit the trade show?
And why isn't this
in buybuy Baby
or, like, real, like,
baby retailers?
This issue we had with
our manufacturing
in the beginning really set
us back with our cash flow.
Hmm.
And if we're going
to get into retail,
we need help
from someone like you.
So, now much do one
of these cost?
What do you sell them for,
and what do they cost to make?
So, we got the price down
to about $6 per unit.
?Wow.
?$6 per unit?
And what are you
selling it for?
We sell it for $29.99
on our website.
People will spend
anything on babies.
How much did you spend
on marketing last year
for online ads?
?Yes.
So, our marketing was about
40% of revenue last year.
Ooh.
So it was about
100?something thousand.
Did you make any money
last year?
Yes, we did.
So, we've been paying
ourselves a little bit
because we need
to pay the bills.
We take out about
$4,000 a month,
and we have that pay
for our seven.
But you know what, guys?
You guys deserve
a ton of credit.
?Yeah.
?Yeah.
You've done
a much better job
than people that come out
with MBAs and the rest.
So I can't applaud
you enough.
But even though
it's a great idea,
I think marketing it is going
to be harder than you imagine.
That's why you're spending
40% of your revenue.
?Mm?hmm.
?I think you can get innovative,
but I think it's a lot more
challenging than you realize.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
?Okay.
?Sure, Mark. Thank you.
?Yeah, thank you.
?Congrats, though.
Thank you.
I like you guys.
I think it's phenomenal.
I think you are true
entrepreneurs.
But I like products
that you buy often
and always that you keep ??
you know, consumables or
products that you keep buying.
And I'm scared of it just being
one SKU that you buy once.
So for that reason, I'm out.
?Well, thank you so much.
?Thank you.
You know, I look at this
as a product, not a business.
The only way I'd do
this deal is if ??
It would have to have
this huge contingency
on the patent being issued.
Because I want to take this
and license it
to a large manufacturer
that already has logistics,
manufacturing, marketing,
and a customer base.
?Mm?hmm.
?My offer's this.
I'll give you the $85,000
for 20%...
Ooh.
Wow.
...contingent on the patent
being issued.
And then, you have to agree,
although you'll control it,
to take a license deal.
So now, you would be
okay with us
still selling
this product on our own.
?Of course.
?You shouldn't license it
because you've built
a real business.
?I disagree.
?I disagree with you completely.
What are you going
to do, Robert?
So, love you guys.
My challenge is a little bit
about the single product.
You're very good
with finding needs.
I'd like to see you
expand the products.
I think ?? I think you're going
to need a little more money.
I'd like to see some of
the money be used maybe
for some more product
development, that kind of stuff.
Keep going with the online ads.
[ Sighs ]
I'll give you $125,000
for ??
for 15%.
$125,000 for 15%.
Greiner: All right.
What's really cool is
I've never seen anything
like this.
It fits into my family
of products.
We have our own special section
in buybuy Baby.
So I do feel
I am your perfect partner.
I think you could use
a little bit more money.
I'm going to go
$100,000 for 20%,
and I will help you to finance
all the big orders that
we're going to be getting.
All the offers ??
We love funding orders.
Okay.
So I think that goes
without saying.
But I am so proud of Mike
and all of the hard work
that he's done
for our family.
He's awesome.
Oh, my gosh.
You know what I loved
about them the most,
is no fancy schooling,
no venture capital...
?They just figured it out.
?They just figured it out.
They just figured it out.
If they could do it from Albany,
Oregon, anybody can do it.
Yeah.
