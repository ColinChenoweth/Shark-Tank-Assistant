Hello, Sharks.
My name is Randall Redfield.
I'm the founder of dreampad.
I'm here today seeking $800,000
in return
for 10% of my business.

America has a big sleep problem.
Poor sleep today
is so widespread,
it's considered an epidemic.
How cool would it be
if there was a device
that could improve
your ability to relax,
a device you simply
lay your head on
O'Leary: Randall, I buy that
it works, okay?
You're saying you're going
to make $150,000 this year.
That's a projection, by the way.
After tax, $125,000.
You're asking me to pay 64 times
your profit this year,
if you hit it,
which is still speculative.
Yeah. We ??
Now, you see any problem
with that
that might keep
somebody away at night
regardless of what music
they're listening to?
Frankel: Sounds like a dream.
Sounds like a dream.
A nightmare.
Narrator:
All Sharks are still in.
They're interested in dreampad,
a pillow that aids sleep by
playing music through vibration.
But they want Randall
to defend his steep valuation.

We based the value on looking
at the future value.
We've made projections
five years out.
The price you put on it is so,
like, delusional.
Cuban: Randall, Randall,
have you ever seen
a five?year projection
that was correct?
You're right. It all comes down
to the projections.
You're absolutely right.
Cuban: Look, Randall.
The challenge I see is that
where there's a specific need,
you've got to be able
to convince people
that you are so far better
than the options...
Right.
...that they're going to make
the investment, right?
?So...
?I'm out.
Randall, you valuation
is nuts.
?Nuts.
?I'm out.
?Okay, well ??
?Nuts!
The valuation is from
the planet Zoot Boot.
It makes no sense.
On Zoot Boot, the pay
64 times cash flow.
They have no problem.
The Zootonians will do deals
like this all the time.
I am not a Zootonian.
I'm from the planet Earth.
I'm out.
What are you going
to do, Bethenny?
Frankel: I love this.
I love everything about it.
It's such a lesson to people
to not be so bullish
about their price.
?Randall, it's crazy.
?No, that's nutballs.
$800,000 for 15%
is your counter?
Randall, I so much want
to be in with you.
?Yes. Do you?
?What are you doing, Lori?
Unfortunately,
I have to be out.
?Okay.
?Wow.
Randall,
it was a great product.
I wanted to live
the dream.
Randall, I'll meet you
on Zoot Boot.
?All right. Thank you.
?It was so nice.
Redfield: I was kind of shocked
that they felt
the valuation was that crazy.
But it's worth
what I'm asking for it.
If anybody here
had done that deal,
I would never speak
to them.
You don't want to get into
a pillow fight with me.
People have gone
to the hospital!
Oh, I'm going to
destroy you, Robert.
Oof!
