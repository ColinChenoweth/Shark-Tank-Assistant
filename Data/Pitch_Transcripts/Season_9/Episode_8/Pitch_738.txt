Hello, Sharks.
My name is Randall Redfield.
I'm the founder of dreampad.
I'm here today seeking $800,000
in return
for 10% of my business.
[ Coughing ]
America has a big sleep problem.
Poor sleep today
is so widespread,
it's considered an epidemic.
How cool would it be
if there was a device
that could improve
your ability to relax,
a device you simply
lay your head on
and it could calm your body
and stop your mind from racing
while you're trying to sleep?
Well, that device is here.
I'm happy to introduce
the dreampad ??
a music pillow that reduces
stress and improves sleep.
Music flows from
within the dreampad
directly to your inner ear,
and that process triggers
your body's relaxation response.
Could I get a volunteer
to come up and experience it?
?I would, sure.
?Can we both?
Thank you, Mark.
Sure.
Frankel: I'm so jealous.
?No cuddling here, please.
?All right, no cuddling.
?Okay.
?Oh, I can hear it.
Are they listening
to something right now?
Yeah.
Yeah, it's very soft,
new?agey music.
Music from the dreampad
is audible
only to the person
whose head is on it.
Even someone lying two feet away
on the same bed
can't hear a thing.
[ Giggling ]
?I'm diving right in.
?Take a jump.
?What are we listening to?
?All right.
Oh, wow.
[ Laughter ]
It's amazing.
This is good.
You can hear it
on both sides.
It should go through
most of the pillow.
It's just usually used
in a very quiet room.
?That's good.
?Not bad.
Herjavec: Was that good for you
too, Bethenny?
I haven't been in bed
with so many billionaires
in at least
a couple of weeks.
Okay, Robert.
If you would grab that one here.
I'll go and grab
Lori's, too.
Thank you, Robert.
Is it a feather pillow?
What is it?
There are four
different models.
Two of them are faux feather,
and we have one thin one,
and another one
is in memory foam.
Thank you.
Where's the speaker?
?There's no speaker.
It's a transducer that plays
music through vibration.
So a speaker, typically,
the sound goes out
through the airwaves.
And with the dreampad
transducers,
it goes out internally.
Oh, wow!
It's really nice.
?I'm obsessed.
?[ Snoring ]
Let me explain to you
the way it works.
You download the app
to your phone,
and you can either
play it wirelessly
to the dreampad by connecting
a little wire receiver.
Wow, it's amazing!
So basically, you would
pair this with your phone.
?Right.
?Plug it into the dreampad.
There's a little pocket
on the side.
And then you can play music
from your phone.
The dreampad comes with an app
that has ten music
choices on it,
so we've constructed
specific music for sleeping.
You can use your own music
if you want.
My whole entire life, I've
suffered from lack of sleep.
?Okay.
?I cannot sleep.
So I have a sound machine.
I have the aromatherapy
going in my room.
Right.
What if I put a sound machine
right next to the pillow?
What is the difference,
honestly?
This is doing something
completely different
than the sound
machine's doing.
The sound machine is
giving you a white noise
that's coming
through the airwaves
that's blocking out
other noise in the room.
?Okay.
?And they help.
They're perfectly fine.
?Okay.
The dreampad's doing something
entirely different.
When you put your head on it,
the vibration from the pillow
is going actually through
your body to your inner ear.
So it's the music
and the vibration.
Exactly.
The music is the vibration.
They're the same.
I'll tell you what's keeping me
awake on this deal...
?Wow.
?...is this $800,000 for 10%.
?Well, don't go there yet.
?I have to go there.
Don't go there yet!
I understand the product.
Let me first explain
how it works.
It's a speaker in a pillow
for $8 million.
?No!
?It's not a speaker,
and it's not a pillow.
?Got it. I love the schtick.
?It's not a pillow.
?It's $8 million.
It's a lot more than a pillow.
You don't sell it
as a pillow?
If you call it a pillow, people
aren't used to paying
more
than $20, $30, $40.
What does it cost?
The pillow is $159, average.
That's a lot for a pillow.
?Right.
So that's why I'm saying
it's really a relaxation tool.
My trouble with it,
and we've got to get
back to deal with this
because we're in the Shark Tank,
and you're asking for
$800,000 for 10%.
That's $8 million valuation.
Well, I think it's
an amazing opportunity
for the following reasons.
?Oh, really?
?Yeah.
It's a sleep product
which is addressing
over a third
of the population.
Support that, other than just
saying it helps people sleep.
Show Mr. Wonderful
the money.
We've got $600,000 in sales
since we launched last November.
Okay.
What are you going to make
in cash flow this year
that would want or entice me
to give you $800,000?
Our projections
for the year are $1.2 million.
Okay, what are you
going to make on that?
Oh, our profit on that
will be roughly $150,000.
We really didn't even
talk about your cost.
We have a 65% margin
on the product.
?65% margin.
?But where are those
$1.2 million in sales
coming from?
A combination of Amazon,
direct to consumer,
retail, online retail.
O'Leary: Randall, I buy that
it works, okay?
You're saying you're going
to make $150,000 this year.
That's a projection, by the way.
After tax, $125,000.
You're asking me to pay 64 times
your profit this year,
if you hit it,
which is still speculative.
Yeah. We ??
Now, you see any problem
with that
that might keep
somebody away at night
regardless of what music
they're listening to?
Frankel: Sounds like a dream.
Sounds like a dream.
A nightmare.
Narrator:
All Sharks are still in.
They're interested in dreampad,
a pillow that aids sleep by
playing music through vibration.
But they want Randall
to defend his steep valuation.
You're saying you're going
to make $150,000 this year.
That's a projection,
by the way.
After tax, $125,000.
You're asking me to pay 64 times
your profit this year,
if you hit it,
which is still speculative.
Yeah. We ??
Now, you see any problem
with that
that might keep
somebody away at night
regardless of what music
they're listening to?
Frankel: Sounds like a dream.
Sounds like a dream.
A nightmare.
We based the value on looking
at the future value.
We've made projections
five years out.
The price you put on it is so,
like, delusional.
Cuban: Randall, Randall,
have you ever seen
a five?year projection
that was correct?
You're right. It all comes down
to the projections.
You're absolutely right.
And I would ask you,
considering ??
I project you won't
get a deal today
because you have
a crazy valuation.
I would ask you to consider
the key things
that are supporting
the valuation.
?Which are?
?Number one, it's patented.
?So?
?Number two, it's addressing
an incredible need
within the country.
Agreed.
Number three is it's got
a supply chain
that's completely worked out.
How much have you put
in of your own money?
Over the last five years,
my partner and I
have invested $1.2 million.
All: Wow!
Cuban: Look, Randall.
The challenge I see is that
where there's a specific need,
you've got to be able
to convince people
that you are so far better
than the options...
Right.
...that they're going to make
the investment, right?
?So...
?I'm out.
Randall, you valuation
is nuts.
?Nuts.
?I'm out.
?Okay, well ??
?Nuts!
The valuation is from
the planet Zoot Boot.
It makes no sense.
On Zoot Boot, the pay
64 times cash flow.
They have no problem.
The Zootonians will do deals
like this all the time.
I am not a Zootonian.
I'm from the planet Earth.
I'm out.
What are you going
to do, Bethenny?
Frankel: I love this.
I love everything about it.
It's such a lesson to people
to not be so bullish
about their price.
You can't make up numbers and
think someone's going to pay,
'cause you came here for, like,
the greatest opportunity ever.
And I would've been so all?in.
And I just can't ?? I can't.
It's $800,000.
You know how hard
I work for that?
It's crazy.
And I'm out,
but I'm so frustrated.
I would've been so in.
I'm so aggravated.
?You got one Shark left.
?It's just me.
?Okay, Lori.
?Just you and me.
I like the quality.
I like the feel.
I've done millions and millions
of dollars in pillows.
I like the concept.
I love everything about it.
I like you.
?But...?
But $800,000 for 10%?
You don't really know
what's going to happen.
I actually think we could put
your technology into the pillows
I already sell at
a fraction of the price.
Right.
I sell pillows for a third
of the price.
Lori, what are you doing?
So, you tell me.
What would you offer me?
Because I think you need
to be creative here.
?Randall, it's crazy.
?No, that's nutballs.
$800,000 for 15%
is your counter?
Randall, I so much want
to be in with you.
?Yes. Do you?
?What are you doing, Lori?
Unfortunately,
I have to be out.
?Okay.
?Wow.
Randall,
it was a great product.
I wanted to live
the dream.
Randall, I'll meet you
on Zoot Boot.
?All right. Thank you.
?It was so nice.
Redfield: I was kind of shocked
that they felt
the valuation was that crazy.
But it's worth
what I'm asking for it.
If anybody here
had done that deal,
I would never speak
to them.
You don't want to get into
a pillow fight with me.
People have gone
to the hospital!
Oh, I'm going to
destroy you, Robert.
Oof!
