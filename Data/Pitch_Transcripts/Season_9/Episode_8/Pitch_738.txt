My name is Jenni?Lyn Williams,
and I am the owner
and creator of Snarky Tea.
I am here seeking $150,000
for 25% stake.
At Snarky Tea,
we aim to keep it real
by creating high?quality
whole?leaf tea sachets
that are designed to do exactly
what they say they'll do.
For example, let's say
it's 11:45 p. m.
but you're wide awake.
You found yourself in another
social?media rabbit hole.
No worries, girlfriend.
Our "Get Your Ass in Bed"
blend
will help you
shut down, unplug,
and get some beauty rest.
Or perhaps your to?do list
is crazy long,
and adulting feels like
an impossible task.
No worries.
Our "Fierce Bitch" blend
will have you slaying the day
in no time.
So, who's ready to dive
into the Snark Tank
and change the way
this world sees tea?
Cute.
I have hand selected a blend
for each of you
based upon your unique
personalities.
?All right.
?So fabulous.
Where did she go?
Oh.
Okay, here we go.
?Mrs. Wonderful!
?Mrs. Wonderful!
?Look at that.
?Yeah.
Kevin is married,
I have to say.
?Kevin!
?That's okay.
So, the tin on your tray is
the blend that you received.
You'll be able to find out
what the blend's called
by looking inside your card.
?Hey, girl.
?Thank you.
?You got it.
?Hey, girl.
There you go.
I just need to take off
this jacket.
O'Leary: So, Jenni?Lyn,
I have a card here
that says "Mr. Wonderful" on
the front and inside it says,
"Blend ??
Calm the [bleep] down.
You're just so handsome
when you smile.
That's true.
"Caribbean rooibos
fruit with coconut"?
?It's a rooibos tea...
?Rooibos.
?Rooibos.
?...which is great
for inflammation
and hypertension,
so it really does help
you calm the [bleep] down.
Mine says, "Our signature blend
for the person
fierce enough to swim
with the Sharks."
Well, that remains
to be seen.
We believe in you,
Bethenny.
?TBD.
?Wow.
We know you can hang.
Are all these blends
for women only?
Yes.
That would leave 50%
of the market untouched.
I became really passionate
about this idea
that I'm not the only
woman out there
who's struggling with trying
to meet all of the expectations
that we kind of
put on women today.
So I took a product
that we also have
a ton of expectations
about, right?
We think of tea as kind of
this gentle, dainty beverage.
But I broke it out of its box.
And in the end, I think it's
really a better representation
of what the drink is.
It's a badass beverage.
?So it's intentional.
?Yeah.
Right out of the gate,
you're not going after
half the market.
That's right.
But women are the purchasers
of the household.
When are you
buying tea bags?
I buy them all the time,
actually.
You do?
?Oh, yeah.
?Yeah, I do too.
I drink tea. What am I,
chopped liver here?
Let's be clear, right?
You're not selling tea, right?
?Right.
?You're selling attitude.
?Well, we're selling both.
?Where are you selling this?
So right now, 85% of our sales
are done retail
through our own website.
We do 15% wholesale,
so we're in about 40 stores.
Which stores?
Mostly, like, women?owned
boutiques and gift shops.
I've heard tea, for many people,
is relaxing.
Yet it's called Snarky
and you're going to alienate
places like Walmart and...
?Right.
...you know, a lot
of major retailers.
I feel a little confused.
What are your sales?
We've done $190,000
in eight months.
Whoa!
Give us customer
acquisition cost.
So, our cost of acquiring
customer right now is about $11.
How much is this?
So, there are 15 sachets
in each of our tins,
and they're $12.99.
That's expensive, though.
A K?Cup is 66 cents.
?Tell us your costs.
?Okay.
So, each of our tins
actually cost us $4.34 to make.
?$4.34? That's a lot.
?Yes.
?How much do you sell it for?
?$12.99 a tin.
So you're not making
any money.
Your customer acquisition
costs 11 bucks.
Greiner: Well, listen.
I find that this kind of cute
labeling and all of that,
I'm afraid it's not sustainable.
And gimmicky branding,
I just don't see as long future.
So while I think you are
clever and smart, I'm out.
Thank you, Lori.
Jenni?Lyn, I've done very well
by finding niche things...
?Yes.
?...like the Tipsy Elves guys,
and expanding them.
I think it's a little too edgy.
?I ??
It's a very narrow niche.
?Yes.
I don't see people
buying tins of tea online
as a sole business.
I just don't see it.
I'm out.
Thank you, Robert.
Jenni?Lyn,
now anything that's sold
in retail
competes with Amazon.
?I'm on Amazon.
?Doesn't matter, right?
The challenge is that not only
is Amazon distributing products,
but they're also starting
to create their own...
?Right.
?...that are obviously
priced cheaper
than everybody else.
?Yes.
?And it's their brand,
so they get to put it
and promote it however
they want in
the easiest?to?buy format.
Click it, and it shows up
in two hours.
Yep.
I like what you're doing
from a marketing perspective,
but Amazon's
going to crush you.
I'm out.
This fits on my wedding
platform as a gift, okay?
?I knew that was coming.
?Yes.
And we've got a lot
of customers.
?Right.
?I'll tell you this.
I could sell a lot of these at a
lower customer acquisition cost.
I know how to make
this company money,
and that's what's
going to matter
'cause that's ultimately
what you want to do...
Yes.
...grow a business
out of a product, okay?
?Of course.
?Here's the deal.
I want to be a 50/50 partner.
?Oh!
?Silence.
I'll give you $150,000 for 50%.
Jenni?Lyn, you never give up
50% of your business.
Business 101.
Jenni?Lyn, if you give 50%,
it's not your company anymore.
?That's not true.
?Are you in or out?
I'm just telling you.
I'm trying to help
an entrepreneur,
like I always do.
You're gonna have
to trust your partners
if you're going to get
into business, then.
All right, you guys.
You got a deal.
?Okay.
?Wow.
Congratulations, Jenni.
?Sorry, Mark.
?Hey.
?Mrs. Wonderful!
?She's wearing my colors.
I want to know
if that was intentional.
I was so excited you were
going to be here.
Frankel: I like you.
I'm investing in you.
?Absolutely.
?You're awesome.
Are you going to name
the baby Kevin?
?Absolutely.
?You should.
She's a bad bitch.
Williams: I love Bethenny.
I love her brand.
I love her personality.
So to have fierce bitches
plus Mr. Wonderful,
I really think we're going
to knock it out of the park.
