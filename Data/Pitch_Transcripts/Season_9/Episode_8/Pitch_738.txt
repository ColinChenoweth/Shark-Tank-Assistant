My name is Jenni?Lyn Williams,
O'Leary: So, Jenni?Lyn,
I have a card here
Jenni?Lyn, I've done very well
by finding niche things...
?Yes.
?...like the Tipsy Elves guys,
Jenni?Lyn,
now anything that's sold
in retail
competes with Amazon.
?I'm on Amazon.
?Doesn't matter, right?
The challenge is that not only
is Amazon distributing products,
but they're also starting
to create their own...
?Right.
?...that are obviously
priced cheaper
than everybody else.
Jenni?Lyn, you never give up
50% of your business.
Business 101.
Jenni?Lyn, if you give 50%,
it's not your company anymore.
?That's not true.
?Are you in or out?
I'm just telling you.
I'm trying to help
an entrepreneur,
like I always do.
You're gonna have
to trust your partners
if you're going to get
into business, then.
All right, you guys.
You got a deal.
?Okay.
?Wow.
Congratulations, Jenni.
?Sorry, Mark.
?Hey.
?Mrs. Wonderful!
?She's wearing my colors.
I want to know
if that was intentional.
I was so excited you were
going to be here.
Frankel: I like you.
I'm investing in you.
?Absolutely.
?You're awesome.
Are you going to name
the baby Kevin?
?Absolutely.
?You should.
She's a bad bitch.
Williams: I love Bethenny.
I love her brand.
I love her personality.
So to have fierce bitches
plus Mr. Wonderful,
I really think we're going
to knock it out of the park.
