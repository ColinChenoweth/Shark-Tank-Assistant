Hi, Sharks.
My name is Alan Cook.
I'm from Chicago.
Alan, can you give me a little
bit of your background?
Cook: Certainly.
I, uh, made my way
into the pet industry
by accident over 15 years ago.
It was the fault
of a former girlfriend,
uh, because she came with cats
who used a litter box.
Cook: What would be
the repayment terms on that?
Alan, what is
the interest rate?
Interest at 11%.
Wow. Shark.
Corcoran: I don't even know
if your ask is reasonable,
quite honestly,
because it's kind of like
we have to have
a tremendous amount of faith
that you're gonna deliver
the kinds of sales
you're dreaming about.
Mm?hmm.
For me, it's a little too
high?risk, so I'm out.
Mm?hmm.
Yeah.
Rodriguez: Yeah,
so Alan, first of all,
very impressive pedigree.
Alan, I'm not
feelin' the love.
Because the risk is,
if Lori drops out ??
Well, I'm not
dropping out.
Alan has an offer on the table
from Kevin
for his self?cleaning
pee?pad business, Brilliant Pad.
But Lori also seems interested.
The risk is,
if Lori drops out ??
Well, I'm not
dropping out.
What is your offer?
Cuban:
Congratulations, Alan.
Thank you. Thank you.
Rodriguez: Good luck,
Alan. Congrats.
You can take
the turd roll with you.
[ Laughing ]
Please do!
Thanks, guys.
I picked Lori over Kevin because
she relates to our customers.
With this deal with Lori,
every pet's business
is gonna be our business.
You should've rolled into
my deal.
Why?
Because it was
a better structure.
You were higher up
on the balance sheet.
You took less risk,
