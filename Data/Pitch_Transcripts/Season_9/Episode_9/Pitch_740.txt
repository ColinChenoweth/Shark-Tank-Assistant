Hi, Sharks.
My name is Alan Cook.
I'm from Chicago.
Yay!
And my business
is Brilliant Pad.
I'm seeking $500,000
in exchange for a 5%
equity stake in our company.
The pet industry is huge,
yet it's little dogs
under 25 pounds
that are the biggest
and fastest?growing segment
of the dog population.
And, Sharks, do you know what
every small dog has in common?
Poo?poo.
Pee?pee.
They do.
Small dogs have small bladders
and soil billions of potty pads
every year.
And if you've ever handled
a soiled pad,
you know they are disgusting.
We may love our little friends,
but we hate
the mess they leave behind.
And that's why
we created Brilliant Pad.
Brilliant Pad
automatically replaces
a dirty pad
with a clean, fresh one,
so you never have to handle
a stinky, soiled pad ever again.
Mm.
As you can see,
Brilliant Pad handles
number one and number two.
Then it wraps
and seals the waste
so your home is clean
and odor?free.
Each roll is equivalent
to 27 pads.
So you can leave this alone
for days, even weeks at a time.
Then when the roll is used up,
simply remove and replace.
And the best part is, your hands
stay clean the entire time.
Sharks, with your investment
and your help,
we can grow sales big and fast.
So, who's gonna join me and make
dirty pads a thing of the past?
That's interesting.
Can ?? Can we see
that working?
Yeah.
So, the machine will
advance the pad automatically
according to
an adjustable timer,
which you can set to advance
one, two, or three times a day.
Or you can advance the pad any
time at the touch of a button.
We can see how the machine
takes in the solids,
and it'll wrap up the liquids,
and everything dirty
is sealed inside
while the outside
stays clean and dry.
Turd tube that's sitting
with the first turd a month ago.
Yeah.
Wouldn't that
have an odor?
You would
expect it to smell.
I certainly would.
I thought you might want
to see one.
[ Chuckling ]
Oh, gosh.
A used turd tube.
So, this was loaded up
several weeks ago,
before I left Chicago.
Really?
There are 27 helpings
of leftovers in this roll.
Please,
bring the turd tube to me.
All right,
we got to see this.
You would ?? You would
expect the leftovers
to be horribly stinky
after just a couple of days.
Yes.
[ Laughter ]
Oh, my gosh.
Greiner:
How does it smell?
[ Laughter ]
Bordeaux. 1982.
[ Laughter ]
You know, um,
this is pretty good.
My gosh.
[ Laughs ]
Alan, can you give me a little
bit of your background?
Cook: Certainly.
I, uh, made my way
into the pet industry
by accident over 15 years ago.
It was the fault
of a former girlfriend,
uh, because she came with cats
who used a litter box.
And I cleaned
a stinky litter box,
and I thought it was disgusting.
And I thought to myself,
"We can put people on the moon.
I wish this thing
would clean itself."
So I ended up creating
the scoop?free, automatic,
self?cleaning litter box.
We turned an idea ??
That was yours?
Yes.
Wow.
That gives you total street cred
on this deal.
You've done it before.
Exactly.
What do you have
in sales this year?
We just started production.
We ran an Indiegogo campaign
earlier in the spring.
We sold approximately $100,000
in 30 days at ??
The average price point was ??
was $125.
When do you expect
to deliver and fulfill?
So, we are in production.
I ?? We expect shipments
to be in customers' hands
in six weeks.
What's your cost?
So,
our cost of goods ??
Um, the machine is $54.
Okay.
Retail price is $149.
And then
for making it in bulk ??
So it's $149 for the unit.
How much for the rolls?
Uh, the rolls, on subscription,
as little as $19.99, delivered.
When I went
to business school,
my summer job
was at the Bisto brands
to launch the first
10?times?more?absorbent
kitty litter.
Mm.
Did it ever
come on the market?
It was
a premium product.
Yep.
I thought
it would never work.
And I learned
something extraordinary ??
people love their pets.
Yes.
And they want their experiences,
in terms of excrement,
to be pleasant
for their animals.
Mm?hmm.
And listen, the people
paid a fortune for it.
It was
a huge success.
Yeah.
It was my first
big marketing gig.
And what year
did you do that?
[ Laughter ]
But my point is, I have
experience in this market...
He has experience
in every single thing.
...and I believe
that people
really take care
of their pets...
So, he ceases
to amaze me.
...so I'm gonna make you
an offer, okay?
You want me to pay
$10 million valuation,
basically, right?
Yes. Yes.
Not loving it.
Not feelin' the love
at that valuation.
I hear ya.
But I'll give you
the $500,000 as debt.
Okay.
Okay?
Cuban:
Of course you will.
And I'll take
10% equity.
And...
you know, I'll squat on it
and promote it.
[ Laughter ]
This is Kevin's version
of the Squatty Potty.
And there will go
all of your sales!
Cook: What would be
the repayment terms on that?
Alan, what is
the interest rate?
Interest at 11%.
Wow. Shark.
Corcoran: I don't even know
if your ask is reasonable,
quite honestly,
because it's kind of like
we have to have
a tremendous amount of faith
that you're gonna deliver
the kinds of sales
you're dreaming about.
Mm?hmm.
For me, it's a little too
high?risk, so I'm out.
Mm?hmm.
Yeah.
Rodriguez: Yeah,
so Alan, first of all,
very impressive pedigree.
And I think you have something
very impressive here.
For me,
I don't see my brand
really moving the
dog?poop market, for example.
Cuban: I don't know
I don't know.
But I wish you
a lot of luck.
And for that reason,
I'm out.
I don't know,
Alex.
[ Laughter ]
I have the only
viable offer out,
and two Sharks
have just dropped out.
And what's happening here
is you're losing leverage.
Every time
another Shark drops out...
Kevin, let ??
let me help you with that.
...I can't help
the greed come back.
Alan, Kevin and I look
at valuations differently.
Yep.
I look at valuations
as an opportunity,
but I also have to look at it
on return, right?
Sure.
In order to make back $500,000
with only 5% equity,
you have to generate $10 million
in after?tax profits.
That's difficult,
right?
Mm?hmm.
That's a big,
big hit.
While I think
it's a nice business,
I don't think
it's that big a business.
Yep.
And so for those reasons,
I'm out.
Ooh!
Alan, I'm not
feelin' the love.
Because the risk is,
if Lori drops out ??
Well, I'm not
dropping out.
Alan has an offer on the table
from Kevin
for his self?cleaning
pee?pad business, Brilliant Pad.
But Lori also seems interested.
The risk is,
if Lori drops out ??
Well, I'm not
dropping out.
What is your offer?
Cuban:
Congratulations, Alan.
Thank you. Thank you.
Rodriguez: Good luck,
Alan. Congrats.
You can take
the turd roll with you.
[ Laughing ]
Please do!
Thanks, guys.
I picked Lori over Kevin because
she relates to our customers.
With this deal with Lori,
every pet's business
is gonna be our business.
You should've rolled into
my deal.
Why?
Because it was
a better structure.
You were higher up
on the balance sheet.
You took less risk,
and you would've made
more money.
You don't have
the financial creativity.
Learn from me,
grasshopper.
Listen to
what I'm doing.
I don't want
to learn from something
that hangs upside down
when they sleep.
No, no, no.
Lori, all men are brilliant.
You know that.
That's right,
all men are brilliant.
It's not a man thing.
It's just
good financial structure.
Learn from it.
I'm gonna invoice you.
