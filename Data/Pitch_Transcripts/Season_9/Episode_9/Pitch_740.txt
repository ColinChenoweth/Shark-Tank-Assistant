We are
Hector and Maria.
We live
in Phoenix, Arizona,
both born and raised
in Puerto Rico.
We are seeking $150,000 for
5% equity in our company, Bravo,
transforming the way
people get paid
for a job well?done.
Sharks, have you ever wanted
to tip or pay
your valet attendant,
bartender, or musician,
but then you realize
you didn't have any cash?
Think about
how many times
you have been
in a similar situation,
wanting to tip or pay
but out of cash.
In the age of plastic
and mobile pay,
millions of Americans
who depend on cash tips
to make a living
are losing out
more and more.
But Bravo is
a seamless payment solution
that allows you to find
and pay...anyone!
Unlike other mobile?payment
solutions in the market,
with Bravo,
you don't need to be friends.
And you do not exchange any
of your personal information.
Imagine that Monte Pittman
is a street performer
and that he depends on those
cash tips to make a living,
to feed his family.
[ Guitar playing ]
Corcoran: Wow.
Cuban: Yeah!
Rodriguez: Wow.
Greiner: Beautiful.
Very nice.
Maria: Okay, after such
a brilliant performance,
I want to tip Monte,
but I don't have cash
on me.
However,
I always have my phone.
So this is where
Bravo comes in handy,
because now you can find him
by proximity on the app.
You search him
by name
if you don't have him
by proximity.
Enter the amount
you want to tip.
And at the end
of the transaction,
you can enter a rating
or a comment.
It's that simple
to tip or pay
and to empower a hard?working
person like Monte.
He has been so generous
to perform for us,
but he is actually
a renowned musician,
a singer/songwriter,
largely known for being
Madonna's guitarist for years,
and now
a Bravo fan.
Whoo!
Whoo!
Thank you, Monte.
Bravo to you,
Monte.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Sharks, we're open
for questions.
Corcoran: Help me with something
I just don't understand.
How do you get the money
into his pocket?
I feel like I missed
something basic there.
I find him by proximity
on my app ??
Greiner: But does he
have to have the app?
Yeah, but how does he
get the cash?
He does
have to have the app.
He has to have a phone.
It's free
to download.
Okay.
It takes seconds
to download.
So, how do I know that he has
Bravo when he's on the street,
or I want to tip him
anywhere I find him?
We support them
with a point?of?sale material
that lets people know
that they're accepting Bravo.
Right now,
we penetrated 25%
of the service industry
in Arizona ??
valet attendants, musicians,
service professionals.
We already
dominated Arizona,
and we're already seeing
more than 1,000 cities ??
What does
"dominating Arizona" mean?
How many dollars in tips
are you processing a month?
Almost $1 million.
A month?
Well, in the lifetime
of the app.
In the lifetime
of the application.
But the way
we're scaling this ??
We go to the service
professionals, to the artists,
and then
they help us grow
because they talk to their
fan base and their customers.
Cuban: But what about like,
Venmo, right?
Why don't you just put a sign
that has your PayPal address,
has your Venmo address,
has Facebook Messenger payment,
and just
let anybody pick?
Because it's not
a secure instrument
to connect people
that are strangers.
Is there anyone else
doing this?
Bravo is
a unique product.
How do you make money
off of this model?
We charge
a 2% convenience fee.
So you take
2% of the tip.
No, we ??
No.
From the tipper?
The person that pays ??
For example, if I'm gonna
tip $10, I pay $10.20.
The person receiving receives
a whole $10 in the bank account.
Rodriguez: Can I hear a little
bit about your background?
Well, I come from a small town
called Isabela, Puerto Rico.
It's beautiful.
And I grew up in a family ??
extremely poor.
My mother made
a dollar an hour.
We were six
at home.
But I'm so proud of that
because she told us,
"I qualify for support
from the government,
but I don't take it
because I want my children
to earn the money they make."
And that got instituted
in my heart,
and I have earned everything
I have in life.
I graduated high school
at age 16
with a grade?point average
of 4.0.
That's great.
I went
to the University of Puerto Rico
and obtained
a bachelor's degree
and then
a master's degree
from the University of Texas
at Austin.
Good for you.
And after that,
I started my career in Nabisco,
marketing
and business development,
and understanding
that you always
have to talk
to your customers.
After that, Bravo,
which is the pride of my life.
Because my mother used to
depend on those tips,
I know
how much it hurts at home
when there's a week
of poor tipping.
Maria, can I ask you how you got
to a $3 million valuation?
Yes.
You want
to hear about me?
[ Laughter ]
I would love to, yes.
[ Laughter ]
I'm sorry, Hector,
go ahead.
I'm married to her,
the CEO.
I am
a medical doctor
and a board?certified
gastroenterologist
and liver?transplant
specialist.
Did you leave your job
in the medical profession
and are doing this
full?time?
Hector is working
as a physician,
and he's also the COO for Bravo
and my co?founder.
I am 100% dedicated
to Bravo.
And I haven't, uh,
finished the answer
about how
we make money.
Bravo has data aggregation
based on user behavior.
That ?? It's predicted
by the machine learning.
We have
a well?thought strategic plan,
and it has
three pillars.
Can I just leave your
three pillars for a minute?
Because when you start
talking like that,
I?I feel
I get more confused. [ Laughs ]
You said you want to make it
easy to tip or pay.
The more
I sit here and listen,
the less easy
it feels to me.
That's my read on it.
I could imagine you spending
endless millions of dollars
building this until you get
the mass that you really want.
I fear how much money this thing
is gonna take.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Maria, you are one of
the most impressive people
I've ever seen
on the carpet here.
I'm your customer completely,
and I've talked with Mark.
We would like
to invest in it together.
Corcoran: Wow.
Oh, my God,
that's a dream come true.
Don't get happy yet.
Don't get happy yet.
Here's the offer.
All right.
$150,000 for 15%.
But you get
both of us.
Um...I ??
Ouch.
Whoa.
I think 15% is ?? is quite high
for the $150,000,
and I know
that you bring a lot of value.
So we're gonna counter.
We will do $150,000
for 10%,
but we will give
each one of you
1% in advisory fees
for a total of 12%.
Maria: Gracias.
Bye?bye.
Don't forget
to tip me.
[ Laughter ]
Hector: Having two Sharks
on the Bravo team is...
Both:
A dream come true.
I?I still need
a pinch.
Can you pinch me?
Are you awake?
