How you doing, Sharks?
My name is Donte Morris.
And I'm Dominic Morris.
We're twin brothers
out of Oakland, California.
Our company
is called HoopMaps.
We're seeking $100,000
in exchange for 5% equity
in our company.
Now, Sharks, how many
of you guys like to stay active?
I like
to stay active.
One of the things
I like to do to stay active
is play basketball ??
pickup basketball ??
but I always find it
difficult to do.
Bro, what you mean?
You know you can text me.
Man, you know you don't never
pick up your phone.
How about you hop in your car
and drive to a different park?
I do, but every time I drive
to a different park,
I'm either
just missing the good game
or I'm spending my time
waiting an hour
just to hop into
another game.
It's the 21st century.
There has to be
a better way.
Well, there is
a better way.
It's called HoopMaps.
HoopMaps is a mobile app
that allows users
to find pick?up games
wherever you're at.
Ah.
And it's very easy
to use.
All you do
is log in to the app,
you create a username
and a password,
and voilà,
you're in.
Once you're in,
it's gonna send you
to a map screen
that'll have two icons.
Blue icon represents
games that haven't started yet,
while the orange icon
represents games
that's already
in progress.
And it's very easy
to create a game, as well.
Just hit the app screen
in the top right corner.
Once you create the app screen,
you just put in the place,
the time of the game,
the game duration.
You can even invite people
to the game, too.
So, I can invite Alex,
I can invite Mark.
[ Chuckles ]
And I just
hit "create,"
and then you're right there
in the game.
Wait, hold up,
you didn't add me, though.
My bad.
[ Chuckles ]
The beauty about HoopMaps,
though,
it sends all users
a push notification
within
a 25?mile radius.
So, I see you guys playing,
so I'm gonna add myself in.
Mark, Alex,
you guys want to come down,
get a quick game of two,
see what you guys got?
I'm gonna pick Alex.
I'm a life?long
Yankees fan, so...
Wrong sport.
I wish
we had a bat.
Donte: I know
you play ball. Let's go.
You're twins,
so which one's mine?
Cuban:
Yeah, I know.
[ Laughter]
[ Chatter ]
Checking up.
Checking ?? me and you?
Me and you.
Okay.
Let's do it, let's do it.
Let's go.
Donte: So, our revenue model
right now is,
having a premium subscription
through our models,
we have 50,000 users.
So you have 50,000
using it now
but nobody's
a premium payer yet, right?
Correct.
When are you gonna flip
that switch to premium?
That's actually
why we're here now.
Uh, we actually just
really released our app,
you know,
just only in January.
Now, 50,000 users sounds good,
right,
but you got to be
in the same city,
otherwise,
it doesn't really work.
Right.
So where are most
of your users at?
Most of our users right now
is in New York City,
but, uh, the way
we launched this,
75% of our users,
through Google search.
So, people are typing in
"pickup basketball."
We lead this space.
And so have you had
50,000 downloads?
How many people are using it
on a daily basis?
So, we have 10,000
daily active users.
That's not bad, guys.
That's actually not bad at all.
Who did the coding
for this?
Who created your app?
Yes, same question.
So actually,
when we thought of this app,
we said, "One of us is gonna
have to know how to code,"
so I took three months out of
the year, learned how to code,
and I built the basic framework
of this app.
That is awesome.
Man...that's badass.
Thank you.
Dominic: We're the type
of people that, you know,
see something
and then, like,
we don't let any excuse
get in our way.
Can I ask you how you got into
a $2 million valuation?
We're the leader
in this space.
We have 72%
of our natural search
come through people
looking for our app online.
$2 million
is a modest valuation.
Even though
you have no revenue?
Modest?
Yeah,
I wouldn't call it modest.
I wouldn't say
it's modest.
Okay.
Cuban: Yeah, that's like
Oakland b?ball players.
They ain't modest, right?
Can I ask you ?? is this your
first business you've launched?
For the past 10 years,
we've been running
a recreational baseball league
out of Sacramento.
So, for us
to do this pickup app,
it's right up
our ally.
But what is
your competitive advantage?
Why do I want to invest
in your business?
It's because we know this age
demographic of 18 to 25.
We know
how they play.
We know what time they play.
We know their habits.
We know
their spending habits.
Look, I buy your story.
You've got 10,00 active users.
The question mark that's hanging
over you head is,
what's the conversion rate
gonna be to the premium service?
Because right now,
you make no money.
Well,
look at it this way ??
What are you charging
for the premium service?
What's your
intention there?
We're gonna charge $8.99
per month or $100 per year.
What do I get
for the premium service?
So, premium users, for people
that play basketball often,
a lot of people they might want
to find more games.
We'll provide
a better experience
for our users that use the app
more frequently.
But better in what way?
Meaning like, you can see
different games in the area.
But can't you do that
on your regular app right now?
That's gonna be tough,
guys.
That's ?? That's gonna be tough,
right?
'Cause when you
need guys to play,
you're not gonna say,
"All right,
you're a premium member,
come play."
You want bodies,
you know?
You don't even care
if they can play sometimes.
I've been pitched pickup
location apps a lot,
you know,
so there are other apps,
and there's websites
where you can ??
you can go look
for games.
Well, a lot of apps that's out
there out the market right now,
they try to go into different
verticals with different sports.
They have 15 ??
Because it didn't work
just with basketball.
Corcoran: Let's say your
premium service doesn't work.
How are you gonna make money
with this thing?
Through our brands.
Through brands. Uh, so, we ??
Advertising?
Through advertising.
Yeah.
I think if you could connect
a celebrity
or some type of name to it,
that would really help you.
I'm not a super sporty girl ??
I have to be honest ??
so I don't think
I'm the right partner for you.
Okay.                      Okay.
I hope someone else is.
I'm sorry, I'm out.
O'Leary: What's missing
in the presentation ??
it's been bothering me
since the beginning ??
is you get as far as
to have an actual community
and a platform of 10,000 people
actively using it ??
very cool
to get there ??
but then no indication
of monetization.
This is just "maybe this works,"
"maybe this works."
That's what's missing.
I'm sorry, guys, I'm out.
You know, Dominic, Donte,
this is the problem ??
at this point, it's just
too small of a business.
I wish you guys the best,
but I'm out.
All right, thank you.
Look, the bigger questions
is your revenue model, right?
At some point,
you got to have sales.
The subscription approach
is gonna be tough.
Trying to get 8 bucks a month
from somebody who just knows
that once they find a game,
they're just gonna go back
to that same place 90% of
the time, it's gonna be tough.
And I don't just want
to make an investment
and then have to reinvent
your business for you.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay.
All right, thank you.
Thank you.
?Guys, before you leave...
?Good luck.
...next time you pitch
an investor,
tell them
how they're going to make money.
They're too early for us.
And what I would suggest
is go out and find
the next Steph Curry,
the next Kobe Bryant
or LeBron James.
Go give that person
25% of your business.
You need sizzle.
?That's very good advice.
?Thank you, guys.
?Thank you.
?Thank you.
?Good luck, guys. Thanks.
?Good luck, guys.
?Thank you.
?Good luck, guys.
Donte: We're gonna grind
like we always do.
You know,
we're from Oakland,
so we're just gonna take that
advice that we have from them
and we're just
gonna make it work.
And this time next year,
you guys will see HoopMaps
in a way bigger light.
I'm cheering for them.
And I got to tell you,
when I see diverse C. E. O. s
and founders,
it really excites me,
'cause in Silicon Valley,
there's just a huge lack.
?Yeah.
?Absolutely.
Right, and a huge lack
of women, as well.
Yes, absolutely.
Shocking.
Mark,
I want another rematch.
But I get the ball first
this time?
Come on. Come on.
Yes.
