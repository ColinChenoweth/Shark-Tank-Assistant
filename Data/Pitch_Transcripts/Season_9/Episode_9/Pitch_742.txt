Hi, Sharks.
My name is Krista Woods.
And if you stink,
it's not my fault.
[ Laughs ]
My company's GloveStix,
and I'm looking for $150,000
for a 10% stake in my business.
As a mother
of three athletic children,
I wasted
way too much time and money
trying to get rid of the odor
that was literally living
in their sweaty gear.
I tried every chemical spray,
every wash, every "trick,"
and nothing actually worked.
That's when
I invented GloveStix.
They are an easy?to?use
odor?management solution
that is solving
the world's stink problem
one athlete at a time.
My Stix are unique
because they address
the odor problem three ways.
The plastic on the outside
contains silver ions.
They will quickly inhibit 99.9%
of odor?causing bacteria growth
in a 24?hour period.
On the inside, you have
these replaceable inserts.
They absorb moisture
and deodorize.
They work in gloves,
shoes, boots,
cleats, helmets, kneepads.
You name it.
You just put the Stix in.
And they get the stink out.
[ Chuckles ]
So, what do you say?
A deal with me
definitely will not stink.
Are you gonna show us
your product?
Yes, absolutely.
Thanks, Krista.
You're welcome.
Do these double
as nunchucks?
?Thank you so much.
?Yes, exactly.
Everybody says that.
That's why the kids love them.
Krista, you know,
I spent o?over 20 years
in a Major League
locker room,
and, boy, I wish
I had these when I played
for some of my teammates.
Yes.
?Yeah.
?How does they work exactly?
So, the moisture
gets trapped inside the gear,
and then it has
nowhere to go.
It breeds
odor?causing bacteria.
We're talking staph, E. coli,
MRSA, mold, mildew.
That's what's living
in our kids' gear.
So, let me ask you a question
about that claim.
I?I have a lot of shoes.
They're handmade
by Italian virgins.
Yes.
They're beautiful.
?But ?? But when I ?? when I...
?Or so they say to you.
When I bring them home,
each set of shoes
has a last for them.
In other words,
they're made out of cedar.
I insert them into the shoe
to ?? to hold them in place
while I don't wear that set,
and I go on
to one of my other 20 pair.
Yes.
I'm kind of a Imelda Marcos
about shoes.
Yeah, but you're the only guy
on earth that has that.
The reason they're cedar is,
true or false,
cedar absorbs odor.
It has
for hundreds of years.
It also kills bacteria.
Is this better than cedar?
It is better than cedar.
Cedar does not
actually kill bacteria.
It simply absorbs moisture.
There are no products
that do both.
That's why my products
work so well,
and that's why we're growing
at such a rapid pa?? pace.
And I have a patent on it!
?You do?
?On bo?? On both?
I just got it four days ago.
Yes!
Oh, so, how has
that panned out?
You said your sales
are skyrocketing.
Yep.
Give us the details.
So, my sales are $506,000.
?Over what period?
?Over what period?
A year and a half,
but $440,000 in the last year.
And where are
you selling them?
So, I sell online.
I have a website.
And I'm also on Amazon.
And then
I'm about 55% wholesale.
It's just me and the company.
I have no employees.
I also have been on QVC
four times.
I was gonna say.
I thought I recognized...
I?I kind of stalked you
in the cafeteria one day.
[ Both laugh ]
You got through
all the bodyguards?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Totally.
$150,000 for 10%
imputes a $1.5 million value.
Yeah. So...
On ?? On an odor stick.
So, what we haven't talked ???
15 times.
[ Laughs ]
It's more than an odor stick.
But what we haven't talked about
is the re??
I...
...the reoccurring income.
So, we retail these
for $29.99.
They come in the package ready
to go with the inserts in them.
So, what you're
not realizing is,
you have to change the inserts.
So what I ??
What does a refill pack cost?
I retail it for $7.95.
Oh, that's expensive.
I'm never gonna agree with you
on your valuation, okay?
Rather than beat you up on it,
I'm gonna step out.
Rodriguez: What you're doing
is incredible.
Thank you.
Can you tell me a little bit
about your background?
I was 18 when I got pregnant.
I had to drop out
of high school.
Ready or not,
I was gonna be a single mother.
So I took on that challenge
despite my fears,
and I fought those fears
every single day.
And, you know,
when I was 22 years old,
I was promoted to a manager
in a male?dominated industry.
Good for you.
And at 24 years old,
I met the most awesome guy
and married him,
and we are
still married today.
We have two other children.
And I'm not only doing it ??
I am nailing it.
[ Laughs ]
I am nailing it.
Good for you.
Hear, hear!
Thank you.
For the last year and a half,
people have asked me if I was
gonna go on "Shark Tank."
I said, "No way."
And then a few months ago, I
realized it was my fear talking,
because I'm scared right now.
But I'm fighting it...
to be here in front of you all.
I know that you all can take
my product to the next level.
I know I have
something unique, original,
and I know it's going to sell.
You ?? You've struck
every cord in my body.
You know,
I come from a single mother.
She had two jobs.
I would see her leaving
the house at 7:00 a. m.
and come home
at ?? at midnight.
And sometimes
I would wait up at night
and count her tip money.
So I want to say
congratulations.
Thank you so much.
Krista, I want to talk
a little bit
about how you're
gonna scale this business.
Yes.
It seems to me
that you're a micromanager
and you're very connected,
which is great,
but all great entrepreneurs ??
At some point, you have
to be able to delegate.
Absolutely.
That's why I'm here.
To be honest, I wouldn't be here
if I wasn't looking for someone
that has the expertise
to take me to the next level.
Krista, th?? Alex
brings up a good point.
Why haven't you hired
somebody to help you?
So, I just started
hiring people
to help with sales
all over the country.
I have a few people
selling in other states.
You know what I think?
I think you're a perfectionist.
I'm not a perfectionist.
I just want to do this right.
You know, I have my kids sitting
at home watching me right now,
and I want to do this right.
Krista, look, what you've
accomplished is amazing, right?
You should be proud
of yourself.
But it's what you do next
that matters.
Yeah. Agreed.
I have a saying ??
Perfection is the enemy
of profitability, right?
Perfection is also
the enemy of growth,
where you try to hold on
so tight, right?
I think you're gonna have
a hard time letting go.
I'm out.
Okay. [ Sighs ]
Krista, I have utmost respect
for you and what you've done,
but I'm a lot more interested
in you
than I am in the product.
So I personally am out.
Thank you.
I appreciate it.
When I first started
my business,
I didn't take in
a whole bunch of people.
I had to wear
a lot of hats,
and I had to play
a lot of roles,
and I did it all myself.
Of course.
And I did it
because I wanted to make sure
everything was done right.
There's no one else but you
who will feel the passion,
have that dedication, and
make sure things are perfect.
And when I hear that, that
only makes me like you more.
I would like to make you
an offer.
The part about it that
I?I don't know as much about
is the whole sports side,
with gloves and equipment
and all of that.
But I do think there's a Shark
sitting up here ?? Alex ??
who knows a lot
about that.
I knew that was coming, Alex.
Oh, Lori, get real.
Can bring to the table
the sports end.
You're just inviting him in
'cause he's so good?looking.
No?? [ Laugh ]
Come on.
Don't fall for this, Alex.
?He's even cuter in person.
?Yeah.
Thank you. Thank you.
Alex, are you interested
in this deal?
?The sports end.
?And she's already married,
by the way.
I think that you would be
a good partner
in us being able to hit
both sides of the market,
the GloveStix
and the ShoeStix.
Alex, I'd like
to partner with you
$150,000 for 20%
if you're interested
in going in with me.
Krista is asking for $150,000
for a 10% stake
in her odor?eliminating product,
GloveStix.
Lori is interested, but only
if she can partner with Alex.
Alex, I'd like
to partner with you
$150,000 for 20%
if you're interested
in going in with me.
Before I answer that, Lori,
I?I have a few concerns, Krista,
that I'd like to get into
a little bit here.
Here's the ?? the problem with
a lot of young entrepreneurs.
As you scale a business,
whether it's back office
or administration
or deploying capital,
as it gets bigger
and bigger and bigger,
it gets
a lot more challenging.
I?I'm here today
because of that reason.
I want to be ??
I'm o?? very open?minded.
I'm here because I know
that I've reached
the max of my knowledge
on how to get me further.
You know what?
I?I like you.
Lori,
I?I would do the 20%.
As long as you're open?minded
and let us help you
and walk you
through this process.
That's why I'm here.
You have an offer.
I do.
$150,000 from Lori and Alex
for 20%.
Yes.
What are you gonna do?
One of the things that
I talked to my husband about
was my equity.
I know I have
a huge business here,
so I was hoping
not to go over 15%.
Oh!
Is there any way
the two of you
would do the $150,000
for 15%?
I have a patent.
No one can copy me.
Are you going to take
that pushback?
What about you, Alex?
You know what?
If it's okay with Lori,
if you split it,
we have a deal.
?17.5%.
?So, eight??
17.5%, you have a deal.
?Congratulations, Krista.
?Congratulations.
?Goodbye.
?Bye, partner.
[ Screams ]
Oh, my God!
I can't wait to tell everyone!
We're gonna have
a good time.
[ Laughing ]
Oh, my goodness.
Thank you!
[ Screams ]
Everything I've worked
for the last two years
was to be here today,
and I got a deal
with A?Rod and Lori.
It's amazing.
It's the most incredible moment
of my life.
And it's all because
I went after my fear
and I looked it in the eye
and I tore it down.
