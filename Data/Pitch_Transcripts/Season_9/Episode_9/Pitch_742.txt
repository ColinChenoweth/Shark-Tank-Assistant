Hi, Sharks.
My name is Krista Woods.
Thanks, Krista.
You're welcome.
Do these double
as nunchucks?
?Thank you so much.
?Yes, exactly.
Everybody says that.
That's why the kids love them.
Krista, you know,
I spent o?over 20 years
in a Major League
locker room,
Krista, I want to talk
a little bit
about how you're
gonna scale this business.
Yes.
It seems to me
that you're a micromanager
Krista, th?? Alex
brings up a good point.
Why haven't you hired
somebody to help you?
So, I just started
hiring people
to help with sales
all over the country.
I have a few people
selling in other states.
You know what I think?
I think you're a perfectionist.
I'm not a perfectionist.
I just want to do this right.
You know, I have my kids sitting
at home watching me right now,
Krista, look, what you've
accomplished is amazing, right?
You should be proud
of yourself.
But it's what you do next
that matters.
Yeah. Agreed.
I have a saying ??
Perfection is the enemy
of profitability, right?
Perfection is also
the enemy of growth,
where you try to hold on
so tight, right?
I think you're gonna have
a hard time letting go.
I'm out.
Okay. [ Sighs ]
Krista, I have utmost respect
for you and what you've done,
but I'm a lot more interested
in you
than I am in the product.
So I personally am out.
Thank you.
I appreciate it.
When I first started
my business,
I didn't take in
a whole bunch of people.
I had to wear
a lot of hats,
Krista is asking for $150,000
for a 10% stake
in her odor?eliminating product,
GloveStix.
Lori is interested, but only
if she can partner with Alex.
Alex, I'd like
to partner with you
$150,000 for 20%
if you're interested
in going in with me.
Before I answer that, Lori,
I?I have a few concerns, Krista,
that I'd like to get into
a little bit here.
Here's the ?? the problem with
a lot of young entrepreneurs.
As you scale a business,
whether it's back office
or administration
or deploying capital,
?Congratulations, Krista.
?Congratulations.
?Goodbye.
?Bye, partner.
[ Screams ]
Oh, my God!
I can't wait to tell everyone!
We're gonna have
a good time.
[ Laughing ]
Oh, my goodness.
Thank you!

Everything I've worked
for the last two years
was to be here today,
