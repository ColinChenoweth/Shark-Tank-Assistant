00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,839
WE HAVE A PROGRAM‐‐
PIES FOR GOOD GRADES.

00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,507
THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT

00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,743
HAVE HELPED MAKE ME SUCCESSFUL
THE SECOND TIME AROUND.

00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:59,612
THEY TOLD ME DON'T SPEND THAT
KIND OF MONEY ON THAT MASCOT.

00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,681
AND IT'S‐‐IT'S BEEN PHENOMENAL.

00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:04,117
IT'S GIVEN ME MY MONEY BACK
A HUNDRED TIMES OVER.

00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:06,486
DO YOU HAVE HARD‐COPY ORDERS

00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,155
WITH PEOPLE SAYING,
"HERE, HERE'S AN ORDER,"

00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,725
THAT YOU CAN'T MEET
PRODUCTION ON?

00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:14,227
WELL, THERE IS A VERY BIG
NATIONAL FAST‐FOOD ACCOUNT.

00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:17,097
IT'S GONNA ALLOW US TO OPEN UP
A MR. TOD'S KIOSK

00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:19,632
WITHIN THEIR STORE.
WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE CHAIN?

00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:21,501
McDONALD'S.

00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,003
WHAT?! McDONALD'S?

00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,038
THIS SWEET POTATO PIE

00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,408
IS TO THE SOUTHERN UNITED STATES
AND AFRICAN‐AMERICAN COMMUNITY

00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:30,610
WHAT THE BAGEL IS
TO THE SUBURBS.

00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,812
FAST‐FOOD CHAINS
LIKE McDONALD'S

00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:35,648
DO THE MAJORITY OF THEIR
BUSINESS IN INNER‐CITY MARKETS.

00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,617
THEY NEED TO HAVE A PRODUCT
ON THEIR MENU BOARD

00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,652
THAT'S REPRESENTATIVE
OF THE PEOPLE

00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:41,054
WHO DO BUSINESS WITH THEM.

00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:43,189
TOD, I LIKE YOU,
I‐I LOVE THE STORY...

00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,961
UH, BUT I'M NOT GONNA
GIVE YOU THE MONEY.

00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:51,031
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY I'M NOT
GONNA GIVE YOU THE MONEY.

00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,033
I'M AFRAID
IF I GIVE YOU THE MONEY,

00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,667
YOU'RE GONNA
START CUTTING CORNERS

00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:57,637
AND TRYING TO EXPAND TOO QUICKLY
AGAIN LIKE YOU DID BEFORE.

00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,639
AND‐‐AND I'M NOT SURE
THAT THIS BUSINESS

00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,674
CAN BE RAMPED UP
BY AN INFUSION OF CASH.

00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:04,878
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.

00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,347
TOD, I WOULD WANT
51% OF YOUR COMPANY, MAYBE MORE.

00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:10,417
I WOULD WHACK
THE STUFFED PIE GUY.

00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,285
HE'S AN EX‐‐
HE'S A COST I DON'T NEED.

00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,387
AND I WOULD TRY
AND DRIVE MARGINS

00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,791
JUST WHOLESALING ONE SKEW‐‐
SWEET POTATO PIES.

00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:21,027
YOUR SALES WOULD BE CUT IN HALF.
YOU'D MAKE A LOT MORE MONEY.

00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,029
I DON'T GET EMOTIONAL ABOUT PIE.

00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,864
I DON'T GET EMOTIONAL
ABOUT MONEY.

00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:27,500
I JUST WANT TO MAKE MORE OF IT,
AND THAT'S HOW TO DO IT.

00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,437
BUT IT DOESN'T FIT YOUR WORLD,
SO I'M OUT.

00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:32,505
THANK YOU, SIR.

00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:35,508
YOU KNOW, TOD, $460,000
FOR 10% GIVES YOU A...

00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:39,479
(stammers)
ABOUT A $4.6‐MILLION VALUE

00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,548
THAT YOU'RE PUTTING ON‐‐
ON YOUR BUSINESS,

00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:44,350
AND THAT'S
A‐A TREMENDOUS MULTIPLE.

00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,553
SO ON THAT BASIS,
I'M OUT ALSO.

00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:48,455
(mouths words)

00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:50,657
<i>THREE SHARKS ARE OUT.</i>

00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:53,660
<i>TOD ONLY HAS TWO MORE CHANCES</i>
<i>TO KEEP HIS BUSINESS ALIVE.</i>

00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:58,031
BARBARA...

00:09:58,031 --> 00:10:01,167
DAYMOND...
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,944
<i>THREE SHARKS ARE OUT.</i>

00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,480
<i>BARBARA AND DAYMOND</i>
<i>ARE STILL IN.</i>

00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,182
<i>WILL ONE OF THEM GIVE MR. TOD</i>

00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,518
<i>THE FINANCING</i>
<i>HE DESPERATELY NEEDS?</i>
BARBARA...

00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:20,453
DAYMOND...

00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,590
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,825
I'M NOT OUT,
BUT I DON'T WANT TO GO IN

00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,228
FOR AS MUCH MONEY AS YOU NEED,
SO WHO DO WE HAVE LEFT?

00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,864
HOW ABOUT YOU, DAYMOND?
CAN YOU COME IN WITH ME ON THIS?

00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:34,200
BECAUSE CAN I TELL YOU? I LOVE
WHAT I HEAR. AND I HAVE NO DOUBT

00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,203
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEARN
THE SAME LESSON TWICE.

00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:41,007
SO I'D LIKE TO GO IN FOR HALF,
BUT I NEED TWICE THE EQUITY.

00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:45,245
230 I CAN GIVE YOU,
BUT I WANT 20% FOR THAT.

00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:47,647
(Robert) DAYMOND?

00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,951
YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:54,721
THIS IS A‐A VERY TOUGH
DECISION FOR ME TO MAKE

00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:56,723
BECAUSE YOU REMIND ME OF ME.

00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:59,692
BUT I WOULD NEED
50% OF THE COMPANY.

00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:05,765
AND THEN IF YOU WANT TO GO IN
HALF, WE'LL GO HALF ON IT.

00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:08,735
BUT I WOULD ALSO NEED
TO SEE ORDERS, REAL ORDERS.

00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:11,404
BECAUSE HOW ARE YOUR CUSTOMERS
PAYING YOU AT THE MOMENT?

00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:14,407
ON THE WHOLESALE SIDE,
IT'S MOSTLY, UH, CASH.

00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,276
CASH CUSTOMERS.

00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:19,445
THAT CASH, IN THIS‐‐IN THIS
ECONOMY, IS GONNA DRY UP.

00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:22,448
WELL, I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, SIR.

00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:25,451
UH, YOU KNOW, I RECENTLY READ,
UH, AN ARTICLE IN A MAGAZINE,

00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,520
AND IT TALKED ABOUT
THE SEVEN BEST INDUSTRIES

00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,722
FOR THE RECESSION, AND ONE
OF THEM WAS COMFORT FOODS.

00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,724
I'D LIKE TO SAY,
WHEN WE'RE NOT FEELING GOOD,

00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:33,993
WE'RE FEELING A LITTLE DOWN,
YOU GO GET SOMETHING

00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:35,995
THAT MAKES YOU FEEL
A LITTLE BETTER.

00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,464
AND THAT'S
WHAT MR. TOD'S PIES DOES.
TOD, STOP FOR A SECOND.

00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:40,466
WHO DOESN'T LOVE PIE?

00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,669
STOP FOR A SECOND, 'CAUSE THIS
IS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS.

00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:45,905
YOU GOTTA REALLY THINK ABOUT
THIS, 'CAUSE YOU'RE A GOOD GUY.

00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:48,908
I DON'T WANT YOU TO LEAVE HERE
AND MAKE A MISTAKE.

00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:52,078
YOU CAME IN HERE
ONLY READY TO GIVE UP 10%.

00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,813
IF YOU ACCEPT THEIR OFFER,

00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:56,583
YOU'LL BE GIVING UP
HALF OF YOUR COMPANY.

00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:01,054
THINK ABOUT IT.

00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:05,358
WOULD YOU CONSIDER,

00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,594
IN EXCHANGE FOR ME
ACCEPTING THAT FORM‐‐

00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:10,797
IF YOU DO COUNTER,
I WILL COUNTER.

00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:12,966
(Robert) OOH.

00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:14,901
I LIKE THAT.

00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:18,171
HOW DO YOU LIKE THOSE PIES?
YEAH. SEE? ALL OF A SUDDEN,

00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:21,140
THE OLD FUN, EMOTIONAL STUFF‐‐
OUT THE WINDOW.

00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,142
YOU‐‐
THAT'S WHAT I LOVE
ABOUT MONEY‐‐

00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:26,813
NO EMOTIONS, NO TEARS,
JUST REALITY.

00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:35,088
ARE YOU GONNA GIVE US
AN ANSWER?

00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,756
YES OR NO?

00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,028
I'LL TAKE IT.

00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:43,129
GREAT.

00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,464
ALL RIGHT.

00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:45,932
CONGRATULATIONS, TOD.

00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,368
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YEAH.

00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,670
THAT'S GREAT, TOD.
I DON'T EVEN LIKE SWEET POTATO,

00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,672
BUT I'M HAPPY TO BE IN.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:54,274
THANK YOU. MM.
ALL RIGHT.

00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,276
CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.
MY PLEASURE.

00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:59,512
GOOD LUCK TO YOU, TOD.
(Robert) GOOD JOB, TOD.

00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:02,148
(Tod) GOOD LUCK
TO YOU AS WELL. WHOO!
I STILL WHACK THE PIE GUY.

00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,183
(laughs)

00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:06,719
IT WAS TOUGH GIVING UP
HALF MY COMPANY,

00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,388
BUT IT SAVED MY BUSINESS,

00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:11,190
AND IT'S GONNA HELP
TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:19,552
(O'Leary) SO YOU STICK THAT
NEEDLE IN YOUR HEAD EVERY NIGHT

YES, YOU WOULD.

00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:23,956
OKAY, ONE LITTLE THING.

LIKE, SERIOUSLY‐‐A NEEDLE?

00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:30,496
IT'S LIKE
A SMALL Q‐TIP CYLINDER

00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,932
THAT WOULD DOCK
WITH THE CHARGING PORT.
(Daymond laughs)

00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,569

THE TARGET'S BUILT

SURE. THERE'S GOING TO BE
SAFETY FEATURES BUILT INTO IT.

00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:42,942
DARRIN, I NEED TO BE CLEAR
ON THIS BEFORE I WRITE YOU OFF

00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,578
AS A NUT JOB,
WHICH I'M TRYING NOT TO DO.
OKAY. I APPRECIATE THAT.

00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:47,580
BUT I HAVE TO UNDERSTAND‐‐

00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,017
A TEAM OF DOCTORS IMPLANT IT
IN YOUR NECK BELOW YOUR EAR...

00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:54,587
SURE.
AND THEN YOU STICK SOMETHING
IN YOUR EAR IN THE EVENING,

00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:56,389
SOMETHING, WHAT, COMMENSURATE‐‐
SOMETHING THAT'S THE SIZE

00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:58,424

ALL RIGHT. GREAT.

00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:19,004
YOU'RE GONNA LIKE ME A LOT MORE
THAN THE GUYS. TRUST ME.
I AM. (laughs)

00:32:19,004 --> 00:32:21,640
THEY WERE ACTUALLY ALL
VERY NICE TO ME, THOUGH, SO‐‐

00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,510
THEY'RE NICE, BUT THEY DIDN'T
GIVE YOU THE MONEY.
THEY DIDN'T, SO I GUESS THEY
WEREN'T TOO NICE, WERE THEY?

00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,546
I'M VERY HAPPY.
JUST THE BEGINNING.

00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:29,948
YES, IT IS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
REALLY. I KNOW THAT.
THANK YOU.

00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,550
CONGRATULATIONS.
CONGRATULATIONS.

00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:34,653
(Barbara) THANK YOU.
(Robert) THAT WAS GREAT.

00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,865
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT
I LOVED ABOUT THIS GIRL?

00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:49,468
SHE HAD GREAT PASSION,
AND MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE,

00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:52,437
SHE REMINDED ME OF MYSELF.
I SAW MYSELF LOOKING AT HER.

00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:55,106
THERE'S <i>NO WAY</i> THAT GIRL'S
NOT GONNA MAKE IT.

00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:56,608
I'M EXCITED BECAUSE I THINK

00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:58,610
IT'S GONNA BE
A REALLY BIG OPPORTUNITY.

00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:01,279
HER MENTORSHIP IS GONNA BE
THE BEST PART.

00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:03,275
YOU'RE INVESTING IN,
BUT THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE IDEA.

00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:05,377

FOR ONE THAT I HAVE NO IDEA
IF IT'S GONNA WORK OR NOT

00:34:54,726 --> 00:34:57,295
WITHOUT GETTING A PIECE
OF WHAT'S WORKING,

00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:58,964
WHEN REALLY IT'S JUST
AN EXTENSION

00:34:58,964 --> 00:35:01,399
OF SOMETHING
YOU'VE ALREADY BUILT?

00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:04,002
WE'RE NOT IDIOTS UP HERE. AND IF
YOU WANT TO GET $250,000‐‐

00:35:04,002 --> 00:35:06,471
IS THAT THE NUMBER?
YES.

00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:10,408
WE'RE GONNA TAKE A HUGE PIECE
OF YOUR EXISTING BUSINESS.
ARE YOU GONNA WORK
IN THE FOX BUSINESS?

00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:12,677
WE'RE GONNA HIRE A C. F. O.,
A CHIEF FOX OFFICER‐‐

00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:15,747
(Robert and O'Leary
speaking indistinctly)
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE <i>HER.</i>

00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:17,716
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU MY MONEY,

00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:19,951
AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA PUT
YOUR ENERGY INTO THE HUNKS?

00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:23,054
IT'S PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY,
BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA BENEFIT‐‐
YEAH, BUT YOU HAVE
THE PEANUT BUTTER.

00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:25,957
YOU'RE NOT GIVING US
THE JELLY.
YOU GOTTA PACKAGE
BOTH BUSINESSES.

00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,360
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?

00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,128

OOH.

00:35:36,668 --> 00:35:39,404
WE HAD A PROFIT MARGIN
OF ABOUT 20%.
CA‐CHING.

00:35:39,404 --> 00:35:42,574
THIS IS WHY
WE GOTTA HAVE THE HUNKS.

00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:45,677
HEY, THAT‐‐THAT MAY NOT
SOUND RIGHT ON TV. HANG ON.

00:35:45,677 --> 00:35:48,046
I THINK THE ATTRACTIVE THING
THAT YOU'VE OFFERED HERE

00:35:48,046 --> 00:35:50,715
IS THAT YOU HAVE BUILT
THIS INF‐INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:53,184
AND THE EXISTING SUCCESS
THAT YOU'VE ALREADY PROVEN‐‐

00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:55,020
IF YOU'RE GONNA LEVERAGE IT IN,

00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,422
LET US HAVE
A PIECE OF THAT ALSO.

00:35:57,422 --> 00:35:59,824
GUYS, I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER RIGHT NOW.

00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,794
I'LL DO 51% FOR 250K.

00:36:02,794 --> 00:36:04,929
FOR WHAT?
THE EXISTING BUSINESS.

00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:06,931
EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING.
(chuckles)

00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:08,433
DON'T LAUGH SO FAST, BUDDY.

00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:11,136
IT'S NOT EASY TO COME UP
WITH $250,000.

00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:15,040
BE VERY CAREFUL. NEVER LAUGH
AT MONEY. THINK ABOUT THAT.

00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,709
WHY DON'T YOU OFFER US
THE HUNKS AND THE FOXES

00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:19,377
FOR A DOLLAR AMOUNT?

00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:21,446
I'M SERIOUS.
WHY DON'T YOU START AGAIN?

00:36:21,446 --> 00:36:23,548
GO BACK OUT AND START AGAIN.

00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:25,383
COME BACK IN

00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:28,620
AND MAKE US AN OFFER
ON THE OVERALL BUSINESS.

00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,522
OKAY.

00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:36,795
(Harrington)
THEY HAVE TO BE COMBINED.

00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:39,698
IT'S GOTTA BE ONE BUSINESS.
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
THAT THE DEAL MAKES SENSE.

00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,966
I MEAN, WE DIDN'T COME ON HERE
TO GIVE UP ANYTHING

00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:44,536
OF COLLEGE HUNKS HAULING JUNK,
RIGHT?
RIGHT.

00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:47,739
I MEAN, WE STARTED THAT FROM
SCRATCH WITH NO INVESTMENT.

00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:49,808
THEY DON'T SEE
THAT A $250,000 INVESTMENT

00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:51,876
CAN SPIN
COLLEGE FOXES PACKING BOXES

00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:55,647
TO A 70‐FRANCHISE OP‐‐
LOCATION IN 2 YEARS?
I MEAN, YOU WANT TO
THROW OUT A NUMBER?

00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:57,649
YOU KNOW, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
A VERY VIABLE,

00:36:57,649 --> 00:36:59,150
SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS HERE

00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:02,487
THAT WE JUST‐‐
WE CAN'T SELL IT SHORT.

00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:08,960
OKAY, GUYS,
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,230
LOOK... WE BUILT
COLLEGE HUNKS HAULING JUNK

00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,832

00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:15,834
TO A $3‐MILLION COMPANY
IN 3 YEARS.

00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:18,369
WE PUT ALL OUR BLOOD, SWEAT
AND TEARS INTO THAT COMPANY.

00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:20,572
THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN
SELL OURSELVES SHORT

00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:24,309
FOR THAT AMOUNT THAT YOU OFF‐‐
THAT YOU OFFERED OF $250,000.

00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:27,879
YOU TAKE IT OR NOT?
THEY SAID NO.

00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:29,948
WHAT'S YOUR OFFER?
OKAY, WHAT'S YOUR OFFER?

00:37:29,948 --> 00:37:32,684
THE OFFER'S $1 MILLION
FOR 10%.

00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:34,552
WHAT?!
(sharks laugh)

00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:37,021
ARE YOU GUYS OUT OF YOUR MINDS?
BEAR WITH ME.

00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:39,023
GUYS, I WANT TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING RIGHT NOW‐‐

00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:41,025
YOU WILL NEVER, EVER‐‐
EITHER OF YOU‐‐

00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:45,997
GET TO THIS SIDE OF THE TABLE
DOING A DEAL LIKE THAT, EVER.

00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:49,000
YOU KNOW WHY
YOU'RE WEARING THOSE TIES?

00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,003
YOU'RE PIGS.

00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:53,972
PIGS GET SLAUGHTERED.

00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:57,509
YOU'RE ASKING
FOR A RIDICULOUS VALUATION.

00:37:57,509 --> 00:38:00,645
CRAZY. INSANE. YOUR BUSINESS
ISN'T WORTH $10 MILLION.

00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:02,647
IT'S WORTH MAYBE,

00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:05,550
IF I'M BEING <i>REALLY</i> GENEROUS,
600K.

00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,386
THERE'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE.
HOW CAN THAT BE‐‐
HOW DO YOU GET THAT NUMBER?

00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:10,388
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?
WE HAVE ONE LOCATION IN D. C.

00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:12,390
THAT PROFITS $300,000 A YEAR.
I'M JUST
TALKING ABOUT NUMBERS.

00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,959
WHY ARE YOU BEING SO GREEDY?
WE'RE NOT BEING GREEDY.

00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,095
WE JUST‐‐WE‐‐WE JUST‐‐
WHAT, DO YOU THINK I'M IDIOT?

00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:19,798
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
A $10‐MILLION VALUATION?
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.
IF YOU DON'T SEE‐‐

00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:21,733
NOW YOU'RE PISSING ME OFF.

00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:24,002
LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU STOP THIS
CRAP AND DEAL WITH REALITY?

00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:27,372
YOU REALLY THINK
YOU'RE WORTH $10 MILLION?
I‐I BELIEVE THE BUSINESS
IS WORTH $10 MILLION.

00:38:27,372 --> 00:38:29,374
I BELIEVE IN 5 YEARS,

00:38:29,374 --> 00:38:31,543
THE BUSINESS WILL BE WORTH
$10 MILLION.

00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:35,313
OH, I'M SO FRUSTRATED.
I'M SO UNHAPPY WITH YOU GUYS.
SO‐‐

00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,815
YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M OUT.

00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:40,084
THANK YOU. SO THAT MEANS
YOU GET TO STOP TALKING, RIGHT?

00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:41,397
THAT'S GOOD ATTITUDE.
THAT'S GOOD ATTITUDE.

00:38:41,397 --> 00:38:42,787
(Robert) THAT IS‐‐
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,889
BUT I GOTTA TELL YOU,
NEVER INSULT MONEY.

00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:47,826
OH, <i>OKAY.</i> SO...
UNCLE KEVIN'S OUT.

00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:49,727
UNCLE DAYMOND?

00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:53,631
I WOULD JUST BE UNEASY WITH,
UM, THE FACT OF YOUNG GIRLS,

00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:57,235
UH, ME PROFITING OFF OF THAT,
BECAUSE I JUST FEEL, YOU KNOW,

00:38:57,235 --> 00:39:00,338
THE CALLS WOULD BE A WHOLE BUNCH
OF GUYS IN TRENCH COATS.

00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,440
(deep voice)
"HEY, I NEED TO MOVE AGAIN."
WE DON'T HAVE A S‐‐

00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,409
(normal voice) I'M OUT.

00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:06,411
THESE GUYS
HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB

00:39:06,411 --> 00:39:08,746
OF BUILDING THE BUSINESS
TO THIS POINT.

00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:10,949
BUT THEY'RE VALUING
THEIR BUSINESS BASED ON

00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:13,318
WHERE THEY'RE GONNA BE
IN THE FUTURE.
YES, EXACTLY.

00:39:13,318 --> 00:39:16,187
WE'RE VALUING THE BUSINESS
ON WHERE IT IS TODAY.

00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,156
SO I'M‐‐I'M OUT.
(Robert) BARBARA?

00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:20,158
I HAVE NO DOUBT IN MY MIND

00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:22,160
YOU'RE GONNA SUCCEED
AT YOUR BUSINESS

00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,195
JUST AS YOU DID
THE FIRST BUSINESS.

00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,564
BUT I THINK
YOU WANT US TO PAY NOW

00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:29,500
WITH WHAT IT'S GONNA BE WORTH
FIVE YEARS OUT,

00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,037
AND THAT'S A TALL ORDER.
NOBODY'S COMFORTABLE LIKE THAT.

00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:36,507
I'M SORRY. I'M OUT.

00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:39,110
<i>FOUR SHARKS ARE NOW OUT.</i>

00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,145
<i>ONLY ROBERT REMAINS IN.</i>

00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:44,649
THIS IS A TOUGH ONE.

00:39:44,649 --> 00:39:47,018
I THINK YOU DID
A REALLY GOOD JOB

00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:49,220
OF BEING CONFIDENT
WITHOUT BEING ARROGANT.

00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,824
WHEN SOMEBODY INSULTS YOU,
YOU SHOULDN'T INSULT 'EM BACK,

00:39:52,824 --> 00:39:55,226
BUT YOU SHOULD
STAND UP FOR YOURSELF.

00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,262
SO I LIKE THAT.
