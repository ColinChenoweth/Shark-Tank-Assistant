MY ORIGINAL PACKAGING
WAS A JAPANESE PROSTITUTE.

00:00:26,895 --> 00:00:29,431
WHAT KIND OF A PRODUCT
WERE YOU SELLING?
I WOULD SAY
TO MOTHERS OF CHILDREN,

00:00:29,431 --> 00:00:32,334
"LOOK, IF YOU DON'T BUY
MY SOFTWARE,

00:00:32,334 --> 00:00:35,771
THEY'RE GONNA LIVE IN A GUTTER

00:00:35,771 --> 00:00:38,774

00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:43,779

ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO,

DIFFERENT MOMMY AND ME CLASSES.

THE FUN PART ABOUT IT IS,

00:03:41,615 --> 00:03:43,650
YOU DO THESE CLASSES

YES, I HAVE, MANY TIMES.

00:03:49,756 --> 00:03:52,592
OKAY, WELL, CAN I GIVE YOU
AN ANALOGY?
YEAH.

00:03:52,592 --> 00:03:56,096
GYMBOREE‐‐THE CASSETTE PLAYER,
ROMP N' ROLL‐‐THE MP3 PLAYER.

00:03:56,096 --> 00:04:00,233
YES?
DO YOU HAVE SALES? HOW MANY,
UH, HOW MANY LOCATIONS?

00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:02,035
YEAH, WE HAVE TEN LOCATIONS.

00:04:02,035 --> 00:04:05,138
WE HAVE TWO CORPORATE STORES,
AND THEN WE STARTED FRANCHISING.

00:04:05,138 --> 00:04:08,175
SO WE DO HAVE
EIGHT FRANCHISE LOCATIONS.

00:04:08,175 --> 00:04:12,479
WHAT WERE YOUR SALES LAST YEAR?
LAST YEAR WAS $1.2 MILLION.

00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:14,681

ON THAT?
UH, ABOUT 30%.

00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:16,716
(O'Leary) DOES THAT INCLUDE‐‐
INCLUDING YOUR SALARIES?

00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:18,785
NO.
(O'Leary)
HAVE YOU FIGURED OUT,

00:04:18,785 --> 00:04:21,488
WHAT IS THE COST
OF ACQUIRING EACH CUSTOMER?

00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:24,191
BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW
YOU EXIST.
RIGHT.

00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,561
(O'Leary) WHAT DO YOU DO?
WE REACH OUT
TO A LOT OF THE MOMS' GROUPS,

00:04:27,561 --> 00:04:29,563
BECAUSE THE MOMMY MARKETING
IS STRONGER

00:04:29,563 --> 00:04:32,699
THAN ANY PRINT AD
OR ANY TV SHOW THAT YOU CAN DO.

00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:35,902
MICHAEL, WHAT PERCENTAGE
OF YOUR SALES GO TO MARKETING?

00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:38,171
ABOUT 1%.
THAT'S ALL?

00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:41,174
DON'T YOU THINK, AS YOU EXPAND
BEYOND YOUR BASE OF VIRGINIA,

00:04:41,174 --> 00:04:43,543
THAT THAT WOULD HAVE TO
GO UP SUBSTANTIALLY?

00:04:43,543 --> 00:04:46,913
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT.
IT'S ADMIRABLE
WHAT YOU'VE DONE,

00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:49,549
BUT WHAT BOTHERS ME
ABOUT THE BUSINESS MODEL‐‐

00:04:49,549 --> 00:04:51,551
YOU'RE SPENDING 1% OF SALES
ON MARKETING.

00:04:51,551 --> 00:04:54,488
I CAN'T POINT
TO ANY FRANCHISE MODEL

00:04:54,488 --> 00:04:56,523
THAT IS SUPPORTED
BY 1% IN MARKETING.

00:04:56,523 --> 00:05:00,060
I THINK THAT YOU'RE DOWNPLAYING
THE PASSION THAT PARENTS HAVE

00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,796
FOR A QUALITY PROGRAM THAT
COMBINES EDUCATION AND PLAY.

00:05:02,796 --> 00:05:05,532
NO, I‐I‐I BUY THAT. THERE'S‐‐
I‐‐LOOK, I USED TO SELL SOFTWARE

00:05:05,532 --> 00:05:08,535
TO MOTHERS OF CHILDREN
SO THEY COULD LEARN HOW TO READ,

00:05:08,535 --> 00:05:11,471
AND I'D SAY TO THEM, "LOOK,
IF YOU DON'T BUY MY SOFTWARE,

00:05:11,471 --> 00:05:13,974
THEY'RE GONNA LIVE IN A GUTTER
WHEN THEY GET OLD."

00:05:13,974 --> 00:05:17,577
WELL, THAT WAS A GREAT SALES
PITCH. BEAUTIFUL. BEAUTIFUL.
IT WORKS. WE SOLD A BILLION
DOLLARS OF IT, BARBARA,

00:05:17,577 --> 00:05:20,547
LEARNING HOW TO PLAY
THOSE EMOTIONS.
THAT'S A WONDERFUL WAY
TO TALK TO CHILDREN, KEVIN.

00:05:20,547 --> 00:05:23,550
I HAVE TO LOOK AT IT AS
AN INVESTOR, AND SAY TO MYSELF,

00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,619
IS THAT REALLY GONNA WORK
IN THE LONG RUN?

00:05:25,619 --> 00:05:27,120
THERE ARE
SOME TROUBLING SIGNS.

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,122

THERE'S SOME AMAZING GROWTH.

00:05:29,122 --> 00:05:31,191
I'M IMPRESSED

00:05:31,191 --> 00:05:34,194

00:05:44,571 --> 00:05:47,440
I'M OUT.

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,543

TO BUILD A NATIONAL BRAND
VERY QUICKLY,

00:05:51,845 --> 00:05:54,014

00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:05,525

THE ONE I USED TO GO TO
RECENTLY CLOSED,

00:06:12,499 --> 00:06:14,501
AND NOW I HAVE TO WALK

00:06:14,501 --> 00:06:16,503
AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT BLOCKS
IN NEW YORK CITY

00:06:16,503 --> 00:06:19,472
TO GET HER TO THE NEXT ONE,
AND I DON'T BOTHER.

00:06:19,472 --> 00:06:22,108
AND SO I'VE HAD
THE FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE

00:06:22,108 --> 00:06:24,110
OF SEEING A FAILURE RECENTLY,

00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,380
AND I CAN'T GET OVER
THAT HURDLE.

00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,550
SADLY, I, TOO, MUST BE OUT.

00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,819
BABZ, WHY NOT A DAY CARE?

00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:35,522
BARBARA, I HAVE TO CO‐‐
I CAN'T STAND THAT YOU ARE

00:06:35,522 --> 00:06:38,124
COMPARING, UH, YOUR EXPERIENCE
AT GYMBOREE TO ROMP N' ROLL.
THAT‐‐

00:06:38,124 --> 00:06:40,660
I HATE THAT YOU'RE MAKING
A JUDGMENT ON OURS

00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,964
BASED UPON THAT ONE CLOSING
IN MANHATTAN.
I DON'T THINK
YOU MADE IT CLEAR, THOUGH,

00:06:43,964 --> 00:06:47,934
WHAT THE POINT OF DIFFERENCE IS,
REALLY, STILL, IN MY MIND.
MM‐HMM.

00:06:47,934 --> 00:06:49,736
WELL...
CAN WE TRY AGAIN?

00:06:49,736 --> 00:06:52,405
THE BIGGEST THING IS
THE VARIETY OF CLASSES.

00:06:52,405 --> 00:06:55,375
AT ROMP N' ROLL, THEY DO 12
WEEKS, THEN THEY GO ON TO GYM,

00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,377
THEN THEY GO ON
TO A PRINCESS CLASS,

00:06:57,377 --> 00:06:59,946
THEN THEY GO ON
TO AN ART CLASS.

00:06:59,946 --> 00:07:03,617
WE CAN KEEP THEM COMING BACK
OVER AND OVER AND OVER.
AND WHAT'S NICE, IF THEY JUST
WANT TO STAY IN OUR GYM CLASS,

00:07:03,617 --> 00:07:05,652
EVERY WEEK
IS A DIFFERENT THEME.

00:07:05,652 --> 00:07:09,522
EVERY WEEK, THE EQUIPMENT
IS COMPLETELY SWITCHED AROUND.
BABZ, H‐HOW MANY, UH,

00:07:09,522 --> 00:07:14,094
HOW MANY SHARKS ARE IN
AND HOW MANY SHARKS ARE OUT?

00:07:14,094 --> 00:07:16,997
I THINK YOU'RE ALL STILL IN.

00:07:16,997 --> 00:07:20,333
I THINK YOU'RE ALL
STILL INTERESTED. (laughs)
NO, NO, BUT ALL‐‐
ALL JOKING ASIDE.

00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:23,336
THERE'S ONE THAT IS
STILL A POSSIBILITY.

00:07:23,336 --> 00:07:25,505
I MEAN, THERE'S FOUR PEOPLE
THAT ARE CLEARLY OUT.

00:07:25,505 --> 00:07:29,009
I'M IN, BUT ALL YOUR ENERGY
IS GOING THAT WAY.

00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:32,746
I'M JUST CONFUSED.

00:07:32,746 --> 00:07:34,948
WELL, WE WANTED
TO DEFEND OUR POINTS.

00:07:34,948 --> 00:07:37,450
ROBERT, WE'LL STOP
DOING THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,452
WE HAVE SO MUCH PASSION
FOR OUR BUSINESS,

00:07:39,452 --> 00:07:42,455
WE CAN'T STAND TO HAVE SOMEBODY
TELL US THAT THEY DON'T...
I RESPE‐‐I RES‐‐

00:07:42,455 --> 00:07:45,458
I HAPPEN TO RESPECT SOMEBODY
THAT A NO IS A DEFINITE MAYBE.

00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:48,828
(chuckles)
SO WHAT OTHER QUESTIONS
CAN WE ANSWER?

00:07:48,828 --> 00:07:51,331
UM...

00:07:51,331 --> 00:07:54,534
MAYBE‐‐MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT,
DAYMOND. UH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:07:54,534 --> 00:07:57,604
A GOOD ENTREPRENEUR NEVER TAKES
NO FOR AN ANSWER,

00:07:57,604 --> 00:08:02,409
BUT A SMART BUSINESSMAN
KNOWS WHEN TO MOVE ON.

00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:05,812
SO IT'S FEELING A LITTLE TENSE
IN THIS ROOM,

00:08:05,812 --> 00:08:08,982
WHEN I‐‐(laughs)
YOU KNOW, I'LL TELL YOU WHY‐‐
BECAUSE VERY FEW PEOPLE

00:08:08,982 --> 00:08:11,851
CAN COME IN HERE
AND TALK ABOUT MILLIONS IN SALES

00:08:11,851 --> 00:08:13,987
AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF CASH FLOW.

00:08:13,987 --> 00:08:17,857
I WAS ON THE VERGE
OF MAKING YOU AN OFFER,

00:08:17,857 --> 00:08:20,260
AND YOU COMPLETELY DIVERTED
YOUR ENERGY AWAY.

00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:24,230
SO NOW MY CONCERN IS, ARE YOU
GONNA STAY FOCUSED ENOUGH?

00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,533
WE'VE LEFT TWO HIGH‐PAYING JOBS
IN CORPORATE AMERICA,

00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:28,735
WE'VE SOLD OUR BEACH HOUSE

00:08:28,735 --> 00:08:31,838
AND WE'VE INVESTED ALMOST ALL
OF OUR CAPITAL IN THIS COMPANY.

00:08:31,838 --> 00:08:34,774
WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE A QUICK NO
WITHOUT PUSHING BACK,

00:08:34,774 --> 00:08:39,212
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE DON'T AGREE
WITH WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,955
<i>FOUR SHARKS ARE OUT.</i>

00:08:48,955 --> 00:08:53,493
<i>ROBERT IS BABZ AND MICHAEL'S</i>
<i>LAST CHANCE TO MAKE A DEAL,</i>

00:08:53,493 --> 00:08:56,396
<i>BUT THEIR FOCUS</i>
<i>ON KEEPING BARBARA IN</i>

00:08:56,396 --> 00:08:58,965
<i>MAY HAVE BLOWN THEIR CHANCES.</i>

00:08:58,965 --> 00:09:01,935
WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE A QUICK NO

00:09:01,935 --> 00:09:05,238
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE DON'T AGREE
WITH WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

00:09:05,238 --> 00:09:08,208
YOU HAVE ENOUGH
OF A REAL BUSINESS

00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,677
THAT I'M GENUINELY INTERESTED.

00:09:10,677 --> 00:09:13,313
HAVING SAID THAT,

00:09:13,313 --> 00:09:16,316
I THINK THIS IS GONNA REQUIRE
MORE OF MY TIME.

00:09:16,316 --> 00:09:18,318
BASED ON THE NUMBERS,

00:09:18,318 --> 00:09:21,688
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $300,000
FOR 51% OF THE BUSINESS.

00:09:21,688 --> 00:09:25,458
CAN WE TAKE A MOMENT?
CAN WE TAKE A MINUTE?

00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,761
ALL RIGHT.

00:09:32,232 --> 00:09:34,234
(Michael) THERE IS NO WAY
THAT WE'RE GONNA

00:09:34,234 --> 00:09:37,237
GIVE THEM THE COMPANY FOR 50%.
OF COURSE NOT. NOT FOR THAT.

00:09:37,237 --> 00:09:40,206
WE CAN LET THEM THINK THAT
FOR A FEW MINUTES. (laughs)
YEAH, EXACTLY.

00:09:40,206 --> 00:09:42,776
I COULDN'T DISAGREE
WITH WHAT THEY SAID MORE.

00:09:42,776 --> 00:09:45,178
WE ARE EXCELLENT MANAGERS, WE'VE
BEEN THROUGH CORPORATE AMERICA.

00:09:45,178 --> 00:09:48,448

KNOW WHERE HE GOT THAT FROM.
ALL RIGHT, SHOULD WE
TAKE ONE MORE SHOT...

00:09:48,448 --> 00:09:50,517
LET'S TAKE ONE MORE SHOT.
AND COUNTER AT 20%?

00:09:52,418 --> 00:09:55,221
ROBERT,
I MADE ALL OF MY MONEY

00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:58,825
SELLING HOPE TO PARENTS
FOR THEIR CHILDREN.

00:09:58,825 --> 00:10:02,262
THIS HAS SOME OF THAT MAGIC
IN IT. I TELL YOU WHAT.

00:10:02,262 --> 00:10:04,864
I WOULD GO 50/50 WITH YOU
ON A CONTROL POSITION.

00:10:04,864 --> 00:10:08,201
YOU'RE GONNA NEED MORE CASH
ANYWAYS.

00:10:08,201 --> 00:10:10,870
I AM COMPLETELY OUT
IF IT'S NOT CONTROL.

00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:14,207
YES, I'LL BRING YOU IN.

00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,911
ALL RIGHT,
WE TALKED ABOUT IT,

00:10:17,911 --> 00:10:21,581
AND, UM, I FEEL LIKE WE HAVEN'T
FULLY EXPLAINED OUR COMPANY‐‐

00:10:21,581 --> 00:10:23,850
BABZ, BEFORE‐‐I DON'T MEAN
TO CUT YOU OFF,

00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,886
BUT, UH, WHILE YOU WERE OUT,
THE SHARKS TALKED ABOUT IT.

00:10:26,886 --> 00:10:30,423
AND THE GOOD NEWS IS,
KEVIN IS HAPPY TO COME IN,

00:10:30,423 --> 00:10:33,426
SO OUR OFFER COMBINED IS

00:10:33,426 --> 00:10:36,196
$300,000
FOR 51% OF THE BUSINESS,

00:10:36,196 --> 00:10:39,199
BECAUSE I THINK
THAT'S REALLY KEY TO ME,

00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:41,100
TO MAINTAIN CONTROL.

00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,102
WELL, AGAIN, I DON'T THINK

00:10:43,102 --> 00:10:45,171
THAT YOU FULLY UNDERSTAND
OUR BUSINESS.

00:10:45,171 --> 00:10:48,141
WAIT. DON'T SAY THAT.
<i>I</i> KNOW YOUR BUSINESS.

00:10:48,141 --> 00:10:51,110
DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY ELSE
IN YOUR SPHERE OF CONTACTS

00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:54,314

BUSINESS FOR OVER $3 BILLION?

00:10:54,314 --> 00:10:56,583

WE DO NOT.

00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:59,786

(O'Leary) WHAT DO YOU SAY?

00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,829
RESPECTFULLY, WE'D LIKE
TO COUNTEROFFER, UM, AT 20%.

00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:13,066
51% OF OUR BUSINESS, UM,
AFTER WHAT WE'VE PUT INTO IT

00:11:13,066 --> 00:11:15,068
AND WHERE WE ARE
AFTER FIVE YEARS,

00:11:15,068 --> 00:11:17,837
I DON'T THINK
IS A FAIR OFFER.
WE ARE NOT WILLING
TO GIVE THAT UP.

00:11:17,837 --> 00:11:20,840
SO YOUR‐‐YOUR COUNTEROFFER
IS WHAT?
20%.

00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,842
FOR $300,000?
CORRECT.

00:11:22,842 --> 00:11:27,347
SO YOU THINK THAT THE BUSINESS
IS WORTH $1.5 MILLION TODAY?

00:11:27,347 --> 00:11:30,283
WE THINK IT'S WORTH $3 MILLION,
BUT WE'D LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU

00:11:30,283 --> 00:11:33,453
AND‐‐
IT'S NOT WORTH $3 MILLION,
NOT IN TODAY'S WORLD.

00:11:33,453 --> 00:11:36,089
WELL,
THAT'S WHERE WE DISAGREE.

00:11:40,226 --> 00:11:42,195
THE RISK IS TOO HIGH.

00:11:42,195 --> 00:11:46,065
I CAN'T SEE HOW
I'D GET MY MONEY BACK AT 20%.

00:11:46,065 --> 00:11:48,601
I STICK TO MY ORIGINAL OFFER.
NO?

00:11:48,601 --> 00:11:51,437

I'M VERY FRUSTRATED
WITH YOU GUYS, I GOTTA TELL YOU.

00:12:01,314 --> 00:12:04,217

I THINK YOU'RE TRYING

WOULD PAY FOR.

00:12:06,753 --> 00:12:08,554

YOU CAN'T GET THAT LOAN
FROM A BANK,

00:12:12,025 --> 00:12:14,694
OR YOU WOULD HAVE DONE IT.
WE BOTH KNOW THAT.

00:12:14,694 --> 00:12:17,630
IT'S A MISSED OPPORTUNITY
FOR YOU... AND FOR ME.

00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,132

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,421
SO I'M GONNA BOW OUT NOW.
THANK YOU.

00:17:42,421 --> 00:17:44,457
OKAY. THANK YOU.

00:17:44,457 --> 00:17:48,261
I'M IN THE SAME BOAT.
IT'S TOO LARGE A STRETCH‐‐

00:17:48,261 --> 00:17:51,297
THE OPTIMISM, THE EXCITEMENT,
I LIKE THE HELMET, I PUT IT ON‐‐

00:17:51,297 --> 00:17:54,100
I WAKE UP TOMORROW MORNING
AND I SAY TO MYSELF,

00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,669
"WHY DID I GIVE
THOSE GUYS $500,000

00:17:56,669 --> 00:17:58,971
JUST BECAUSE
THEY WERE SMILING AT ME?"

00:17:58,971 --> 00:18:03,776
I NEED A LOT MORE EVIDENCE
THAT THIS TRAJECTORY IS VALID,

00:18:03,776 --> 00:18:06,012
SO FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.

00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,651
THIS ISN'T MY CUP OF TEA,
SO I JUST WANNA... I'M OUT.

00:18:13,819 --> 00:18:16,656
THERE'S REALLY NO QUESTION.
THIS IS GONNA BE A HUGE PRODUCT,

00:18:16,656 --> 00:18:19,325
WHETHER WE LICENSE IT OUT OR...
THE ONLY QUESTION IS...

00:18:19,325 --> 00:18:21,694
YES?
THE NUMBER YOU PUT ON IT,
DOCTOR.

00:18:21,694 --> 00:18:24,297
I UNDERSTAND. I UNDERSTAND.
BUT, UM, YOU KNOW, AGAIN,

00:18:24,297 --> 00:18:26,232
AS YOU GUYS
HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED,

00:18:26,232 --> 00:18:28,067
THERE IS THIS PATENT INVOLVED,

00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:31,003
AND THIS PATENT
IS EXCEPTIONALLY BROAD.

00:18:31,003 --> 00:18:34,807
THERE'S A HUGE VALUE
TO THIS PATENT.
YOU'RE VALUATING THE COMPANY
AT $2.5 MILLION,

00:18:34,807 --> 00:18:37,710
AND YOU ONLY HAVE $300,000
IN SALES.

00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:41,047
TO GIVE YOU $500,000 IN CASH,
I WOULD BE CRAZY RIGHT NOW.

WE WANT YOUR EXPERTISE.

00:19:29,328 --> 00:19:31,831
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I‐‐
I'LL DO‐‐I'LL DO FOR YOU.

00:19:31,831 --> 00:19:33,699
YES?

00:19:33,699 --> 00:19:37,303
NORMALLY I WOULD ASK

TO TAKE ON ALL THIS,

00:19:39,305 --> 00:19:42,508
BUT WHAT I'LL DO FOR YOU IS,
I'LL GO 50/50 WITH YOU.

00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:47,546
FOR 50% OF THE COMPANY,
I WILL GIVE YOU THE $500,000,

00:19:47,546 --> 00:19:50,149
AND MY OBJECTIVE
AT THE END OF THE DAY

00:19:50,149 --> 00:19:53,185
IS TO LICENSE THIS
TO A BUNCH OF COMPANIES.

00:19:53,185 --> 00:19:55,154
CAN I ASK THIS‐‐

00:19:55,154 --> 00:19:57,556

00:20:00,126 --> 00:20:03,262
WE WILL BE PARTNERS, AND WE WILL
MAKE THIS DECISION TOGETHER.

00:20:03,262 --> 00:20:06,599
AND ALL THE ASPECTS THAT MAKE
THIS GREAT WILL NEED TO BE THERE

00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:10,202
OR IT'S NOT WORTH IT FOR ME.
MARIX, JUST SO YOU KNOW
WHERE I STAND...

00:20:10,202 --> 00:20:13,205
I'M GONNA BE OUT. HIS
OFFER IS BETTER THAN MINE.

00:20:13,205 --> 00:20:16,609
I WAS GONNA OFFER YOU
$500,000 FOR 75%,

00:20:16,609 --> 00:20:19,945
BUT HIS OFFER IS BETTER
AS A STARTING POINT.

00:20:19,945 --> 00:20:21,881
THANK YOU.

00:20:21,881 --> 00:20:25,384

YES.
YOU BETCHA.

00:20:41,167 --> 00:20:43,502
IT'S A YES ON MY SIDE.
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.

00:20:43,502 --> 00:20:46,238
THANK YOU.
WE'RE EXCITED. BYE.

I'M HERE
FOR TWO REASONS TODAY‐‐

00:21:35,588 --> 00:21:38,557
ONE, I'M LOOKING
FOR AN $85,000 INVESTMENT,

FOR THIS,
I'M OFFERING 40% EQUITY.

00:21:43,128 --> 00:21:45,130
BEING A LONGTIME GOLFER,

00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:47,166
ONE THING I'VE FOUND
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT

00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,201
IS GOLFERS LOVE TO PLAY
WITH A CLEAN GOLF BALL.

00:21:49,201 --> 00:21:52,071
WHY? BECAUSE THEY PERFORM BETTER
AND THEY LAST A LOT LONGER.

00:21:52,071 --> 00:21:54,607
GOLFERS CONTINUALLY TAKE
A WET TOWEL

00:21:54,607 --> 00:21:57,042
AND PUT IT ON THEIR BAG
TO CLEAN THEIR GOLF BALLS

00:21:57,042 --> 00:21:59,445
OUT ON THE COURSE.

00:21:59,445 --> 00:22:01,480
SO I CAME UP WITH THE TWISTER
PORTABLE GOLF BALL CLEANER.

00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,183
LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN.
SO YOU'RE OUT ON THE GOLF COURSE

00:22:04,183 --> 00:22:08,020
AND YOU SET UP AND YOU TAKE
A COUPLE MAGNIFICENT SHOTS.

00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,523
VOILà! ONE OF 'EM LANDS
OUT ON THE GREEN.

00:22:10,523 --> 00:22:12,525
YEAH, YOU'RE PSYCHED NOW,

00:22:12,525 --> 00:22:14,693
WHAT DO YOU ENCOUNTER?
YOU ENCOUNTER THIS HERE‐‐

00:22:14,693 --> 00:22:16,662
A DIRTY GOLF BALL
THAT'S FILTHY.

00:22:16,662 --> 00:22:18,797
NOW YOU KNOW IF YOU GO
TO TRY AND MAKE THIS PUTT,

00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:21,400
YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT,
BECAUSE THAT'S GONNA CAUSE

00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,536
YOUR BALL TO ROLL OFF‐LINE.
SO WHAT DO YOU DO?

00:22:23,536 --> 00:22:26,672
GO RIGHT TO YOUR BAG, YOU UNCLIP
YOU PORTABLE GOLF BALL CLEANER

00:22:26,672 --> 00:22:28,874
AND SIMPLY UNSCREW IT.

00:22:28,874 --> 00:22:30,876
YOU TAKE THE BALL
AND YOU PUT IT

00:22:30,876 --> 00:22:33,412
ON THE BOTTOM HALF
FOR THE BRISTLES.

00:22:33,412 --> 00:22:35,848
YOU TAKE THE TOP HALF
AND YOU SCREW IT BACK DOWN.

00:22:35,848 --> 00:22:38,617
YOU GIVE IT A LITTLE SHAKE
AND THEN YOU SIMPLY TWIST

00:22:38,617 --> 00:22:41,554
YOUR TWISTER BACK AND FORTH.
THAT CLEANS IT.

00:22:41,554 --> 00:22:43,422
ONCE YOU'RE DONE
DOING THE TWIST,

00:22:43,422 --> 00:22:45,591
YOU SIMPLY UNSCREW IT
ONCE AGAIN

00:22:45,591 --> 00:22:47,593
AND YOU TAKE OUT A GOLF BALL

00:22:47,593 --> 00:22:50,796

00:24:16,281 --> 00:24:19,518

THERE ARE 68 BILLION LOVED ONES

00:24:28,694 --> 00:24:31,864
KNOW THAT THEY LOVE TO PLAY
GOLF. THEY GO OUT ALL THE TIME

00:24:31,864 --> 00:24:34,600
AND BUY THEM NEW STUFF BECAUSE
THEY KNOW THEY LIKE GOLF.
FAIR ENOUGH.

00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,002
IT'S TRUE. I'D BUY IT FOR
MY HUSBAND. HE'S A GOLF NUT.

00:24:37,002 --> 00:24:39,705
THEY WILL SEE THIS AND SAY,
"THAT'S A GREAT PRESENT

GUESS WHAT. THAT MEANS IT'S
A SEASONAL GOLF PRODUCT THEN.

NO, THERE'S‐‐

MM‐HMM.

00:25:02,761 --> 00:25:04,997

PROMOTIONAL STUFF GIVEN OUT.
(Daymond) YEAH.

WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?
HOWEVER, I HATE GOLF.

00:25:15,541 --> 00:25:18,811
SO FOR THAT REASON ALONE,
I'M OUT.

A POLICE OFFICER? WHICH CITY?

00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:24,650

A HOLE IN ONE. I'M OUT.

00:25:30,823 --> 00:25:35,327
I HAVE ONE SIMPLE QUESTION‐‐
WHAT DO YOU WANT THE MONEY FOR?

00:25:35,327 --> 00:25:37,529
INVENTORY.
INVENTORY.

00:25:37,529 --> 00:25:39,565
YOU NEED SALES
BEFORE YOU BUY INVENTORY.

00:25:39,565 --> 00:25:42,201
YOU NEED AN ORDER
FROM SOMEBODY.

00:25:42,201 --> 00:25:44,336
YOU'D BE IN A BETTER SITUATION
IF SOMEBODY SAID,

00:25:44,336 --> 00:25:46,638
"LOOK, FONZ.
HERE'S AN ORDER FOR 10,000,"

00:25:46,638 --> 00:25:49,775
AND THEN IF YOU CAME IN HERE
AND SAID, "WELL, UNCLE KEVIN,

00:25:49,775 --> 00:25:52,745
I'VE GOT A 10,000 ORDER I CAN'T
FINANCE," I'D BE ALL OVER IT.
MM‐HMM.

00:25:52,745 --> 00:25:54,713
BECAUSE I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.
I'M A SIMPLE GUY.

00:25:54,713 --> 00:25:57,149
BUT I CAN'T,
SO FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.

00:25:58,717 --> 00:26:01,320
FONZ, I KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT THIS SPORT,

I USED TO KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT THE FOOD BUSINESS,

00:29:06,271 --> 00:29:09,107
AND THEN I MADE AN INVESTMENT
IN IT.

00:29:09,107 --> 00:29:12,711
AND I'VE LEARNED
THAT THERE ARE <i>MILLIONS</i>

00:29:12,711 --> 00:29:15,580
OF SALAD DRESSINGS,
BARBECUE SAUCES...

00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,582
AND ALL KINDS
OF OTHER FOOD STUFF.

00:29:17,582 --> 00:29:20,986

IT ALL COMES DOWN

ON A SHELF IN A STORE.

MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

A VERY LEGITIMATE CONCERN,

00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:39,237
AND BEING IN THE BUSINESS
FOR 27 YEARS, I KNOW THAT.

00:29:39,237 --> 00:29:42,040
AND FOR ME TO QUIT MY JOB
AND TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS

00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,743
AT THIS STAGE IN MY LIFE,

00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:48,113
I NEEDED TO BE SURE
MY RISKS WERE LIMITED.

00:29:48,113 --> 00:29:50,716
BUT I HAVE A PRODUCT
THAT IS VERY POPULAR.

00:29:50,716 --> 00:29:53,652
LET'S GO BACK TO THE 1,300
STORES YOU'RE IN ALREADY.

00:29:53,652 --> 00:29:55,687
CAN YOU TURN THAT
INTO DOLLARS TO ME?

00:29:55,687 --> 00:29:57,689
'CAUSE THAT'S ALL I CARE ABOUT.

00:29:57,689 --> 00:30:01,059
MY‐‐MY FIRST YEAR,
I HAD 450 STORES,

00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:04,529
AND MY SALES WERE,
UM, $78,000.

00:30:04,529 --> 00:30:06,665
AND WHAT ARE THEY THIS YEAR?

00:30:06,665 --> 00:30:08,266
UM, CURRENTLY I'M AT $41,000,

00:30:08,266 --> 00:30:11,603
BUT I HAD A HUGE LEARNING CURVE
ON MY PACKAGING.

00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:15,507
I HAD TO PULL OLD PACKAGING OFF
AND PUT NEW PACKAGING ON.

00:30:15,507 --> 00:30:17,976
WHY?

00:30:17,976 --> 00:30:20,412
UM, MY ORIGINAL PACKAGING
WAS OFFENSIVE.

00:30:20,412 --> 00:30:22,381
UH, I DIDN'T KNOW IT.

00:30:22,381 --> 00:30:26,952
IT HAD HIS FACE ON IT?
IT‐‐IT‐‐IT WAS‐‐IT WAS
A JAPANESE PROSTITUTE.

00:30:26,952 --> 00:30:29,955
WHAT KIND OF A PRODUCT
WERE YOU SELLING?

00:30:29,955 --> 00:30:31,623
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

00:30:31,623 --> 00:30:35,527
I WAS LOOKING FOR A PACKAGE
THAT WAS VERY INTERESTING,

00:30:35,527 --> 00:30:39,231
AND SINCE I WAS A LITTLE
IGNORANT ON CULTURAL ART,

00:30:39,231 --> 00:30:42,667
I HIRED A CHINESE ART EXPERT,

00:30:42,667 --> 00:30:45,303
AND SHE E‐MAILED ME AND SAID,

00:30:45,303 --> 00:30:48,907
"IT IS A JAPANESE PROSTITUTE
AND VERY OFFENSIVE."

00:30:48,907 --> 00:30:51,610
SO I HAD TO STOP MY PROJECT...
(speaks indistinctly)

00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:54,146
SO THE WHOLE IDEA OF
HOOKER ON THE BOX DIDN'T SELL.

00:30:54,146 --> 00:30:57,082
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
WELL, IT DEPENDS
ON WHO YOU'RE TALKING TO.

00:30:57,082 --> 00:30:59,985
YEAH, BUT ISN'T THAT
PART OF THE PROBLEM?

00:30:59,985 --> 00:31:02,054
LEAVE THE HOOKER ASIDE
FOR A SECOND.

00:31:02,054 --> 00:31:04,256
IS THIS A RUB?
IS THIS A SALAD DRESSING?

00:31:04,256 --> 00:31:06,258
IS IT A FLAVORING, SEASONING?

00:31:06,258 --> 00:31:09,261
AND THOSE ARE ALL DIFFERENT
POSITIONS IN THE GROCERY STORE.

00:31:09,261 --> 00:31:11,630
TO START, I WANTED
TO DO THE DRY SALAD DRESSING

00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:14,900

IT WAS A LOW START‐UP COST

00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:18,203

00:31:26,044 --> 00:31:28,914
WHY NOT CALL

DIFFERENT PRODUCTS.

A WHOLE BRAND.
WHAT ARE YOU PROMOTING THEN‐‐

00:31:38,623 --> 00:31:42,828
THE JADEN NAME
OR THE CHEF IN BLACK NAME?
THE CHEF IN BLACK
IS MY COMPANY.

00:31:42,828 --> 00:31:46,231

CHEF IN BLACK'S THE COMPANY.

THAT BRAND,

00:31:48,233 --> 00:31:51,570
AND THEN YOU STARTED LAUNCHING
SOME OF THESE OTHER PRODUCTS,

00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:54,372
I COULD SEE MAYBE MAKING
AN INVESTMENT IN THAT KIND

00:31:54,372 --> 00:31:57,442
OF A BUSINESS CONCEPT, BUT IT'S
JUST TOO CONFUSING FOR ME,

DON'T YOU THINK A LARGE FOOD
MANUFACTURING BRANDED COMPANY

00:32:30,242 --> 00:32:32,344
WOULD CRUSH YOU
LIKE A COCKROACH?

00:32:32,344 --> 00:32:34,880
IT WOULD BE A SLAUGHTER FEST
FOR AN INVESTOR.

00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,282
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT,

00:32:37,282 --> 00:32:39,784
'CAUSE I'M GONNA TELL YOU,
EVERY TIME THERE'S INNOVATION,

00:32:39,784 --> 00:32:42,120
IT RARELY COMES
FROM THE BIG GUY.

00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,457
THE LITTLE GUY HAS ALWAYS GOT
THE CORNER ON INNOVATION.
BUT IT'S A FLAVOR.
IT'S ONE FLAVOR.

WHAT YOU'VE GOT IN THERE,

I COULD HIRE SOME GUYS
TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU MADE IT.

00:32:51,463 --> 00:32:53,899
I SPENT SIX MONTHS GOING
TO ASIAN GROCERY STORES,

00:32:53,899 --> 00:32:56,768
COMING UP WITH A RECIPE
THAT IS SO COMPLEX

00:32:56,768 --> 00:32:58,904
THAT THEY WON'T
EVER BE ABLE TO COPY IT.

00:32:58,904 --> 00:33:03,808

AS GOOD AS THIS.

YOU KNOW, I'M SCARED TO DEATH
OF THE FOOD CATEGORY,

00:33:11,516 --> 00:33:14,052
BECAUSE THE DEATH RATE
IS SO HIGH.

00:33:14,052 --> 00:33:16,221

ALL THE RIGHT ANSWERS.

HERE AND MAKE GREAT PITCHES,

THE QUESTIONS,

COMPLETELY BACKWARDS.

00:41:12,664 --> 00:41:15,733

BY THE WAY, I KNEW THAT WAS
MY BIGGEST PROBLEM, COMING IN.

00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:55,406

IN WITHOUT THIS" IS

WE JUST CAN'T GO
ANY FURTHER WITH THIS,
