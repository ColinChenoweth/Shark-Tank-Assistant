00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:06,519
AND YOU HAVE A VALUE
OF $150,000 ON YOUR BUSINESS.

00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,521
YOU KNOW, ON $3,000 IN SALES,

00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:12,525
THERE'S NO TRACK RECORD FOR ME
TO INVEST, SO I'M‐‐I'M OUT.

00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:15,996
I UNDERSTAND I'M RISKY,
BUT IT'S A LONG‐TERM INVESTMENT.

00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,998
THIS IS
A SHORT‐TERM INVESTMENT,

00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,800
BECAUSE WE WILL LOSE
OUR MONEY IMMEDIATELY.
I AM WILLING TO WORK.

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,503
IT'S ALREADY CASH FLOW
POSITIVE. I MEAN, I DON'T HAVE‐‐
IT'S GOT $3,000 IN SALES.

00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,972
(Robert) BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
PAYING YOURSELF.
(sharks laugh)

00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,041
(Robert) NATE, YOU'RE LIVING
IN A FANTASY WORLD.

00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,243
YOU HAVE AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT
OF PASSION,

00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:33,279
WHICH IS THE <i>ONLY</i> REASON WHY
YOU'RE STILL STANDING THERE‐‐

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,281
'CAUSE WE ALL ADMIRE THAT.

00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,584
ONCE YOU STEP OVER
INTO THE REAL WORLD,

00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:39,619
YOU HAVE TO HAVE REAL DATA.

00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,855
AND $3,000 IN SALES

00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:45,992
ON A T‐SHIRT THAT YOU DON'T
MAKE, YOU SIMPLY SILK‐SCREEN,

00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,894
IS LUDICROUS.

00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:51,331
I'M OUT.

00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:54,634
NATE, THE‐‐FOR ME,
THE NUMBERS DON'T ADD UP,

00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:58,371
SO I WISH I COULD SAY I'M IN,
BUT I'M OUT.

00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,174
NATHAN, I KNOW A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT T‐SHIRTS,

00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:03,676
AND TO HAVE A GRAPHIC

00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:06,046
THAT YOU DIDN'T DESIGN,
WHICH IS VERY EASY‐‐

00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:09,082
I DID DESIGN ALL OF THESE.
I'M SAYING
IT'S JUST A TYPEFACE.

00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,851
YOU DON'T MAKE THE PRODUCT
YOURSELF.

00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:13,987
I'M JUST VERY AFRAID
THAT MY SHIRT WOULD SAY

00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:17,891
"I INVESTED AND LOST 100%
OF MY MONEY IN NATHAN."
(laughs)

00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,060
I'M OUT.

00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,829

00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:25,932
"TO BUSINESS 101, AND SAY,
'I WENT ON 'SHARK TANK.'

00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:29,402
THEY BEAT ME INTO A PULP"...
(laughs)

00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:33,540
"AND I DESERVED IT.
I'LL NEVER DO THAT AGAIN."

00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,509
I DON'T THINK IT'S A MISTAKE
TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOURSELF.

00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:39,679
OTHERWISE
I'M NOT GONNA GET ANYWHERE.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT,

00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,649
AND THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE STILL HERE.

00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,717
HAVE YOU LEARNED ANYTHING TODAY?
ABSOLUTELY.

00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,252
WHAT DID YOU LEARN?

00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,255
EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN HAVE
ALL THIS CONFIDENCE IN YOURSELF,

00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:53,126
DOESN'T MEAN THAT‐‐YOU KNOW, YOU
CAN'T WALK IN WITHOUT THE SALES.

00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:56,362
WOW. HE'S A LOT SMARTER THAN
WE GAVE HIM CREDIT FOR.
OKAY. SO YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT SAYS?

00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,498
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE MONEY,
ALL OF THE TIME.

00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:01,301
THAT'S WHAT
YOU'VE LEARNED TODAY.
DON'T MISUNDERSTAND THAT,

00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:04,037
BECAUSE I THINK KEVIN, UH,
IS‐‐IS...
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,541
FOR FAR TOO LONG.

00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,511
YOU‐‐YOU‐‐YOU ARE GOING DOWN
THE RIGHT PATH.
OH, REALLY?

00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:15,048
YOU SIMPLY HAVE TO BUILD A GREAT
BUSINESS. YOU GOT THE PASSION.

00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:17,917
DON'T EVER LOSE THAT,
BECAUSE THAT'S INFECTIOUS.
THANK YOU, ROBERT.

00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:20,286
AND YOU'LL GO A LONG WAY.
THANK YOU.

00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:26,960
I FEEL GOOD THAT I‐‐THAT I TRIED
AS HARD AS I COULD OUT THERE.

00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,963
AND I ALSO FEEL DISAPPOINTED
THAT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,831
THAT GUY WAS A GOOD KID.

00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:35,268
EXCELLENT KID.
HE JUST HAD NOTHING.
HE HAD NO BRAND.

00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:37,804
HE IS THE PERFECT EXAMPLE
OF WHY,

00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,306
WHEN YOU DUMP ON PEOPLE,
IT'S SO DANGEROUS.

00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,443
IT'S NOT DUMPING ON HIM.
LET ME JUST FINISH.

00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:46,913
I'M TELLING HIM THE TRUTH.
ROBERT‐‐
LET ME JUST‐‐THIS GUY MAY BE
IN THE WRONG VEHICLE TODAY.

00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:49,816
BUT IF HE KEEPS THAT PASSION
AND HE KEEPS THAT ENERGY,

00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:53,319
HE'LL FIND A PATH.
THIS WAS NOT THE RIGHT PATH.
THERE'S A MILLION GUYS
WITH PASSION.

00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,889
REALLY? REALLY?
YOU BELIEVE THAT?
YES, I DO.

00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,891
I THINK A LOT OF BUSINESSES
HAVE FAILED

00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:01,227
BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE
PASSION. THEY HAVE GREED.
WHAT DO INVESTORS WANT,
ROBERT?

00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:03,897
WE'RE INVESTORS HERE.
WHAT DO THEY WANT?

00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:06,699
WHAT DO THEY WANT BACK? PASSION?
TALKS ABOUT THE WORLD?

00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:09,302
SAVING THE PLANET?
THEY WANT THEIR MONEY BACK.
I'M SORRY. WERE YOU TALKING?

00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:12,205
'CAUSE I WASN'T LISTENING

THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING.

THERE'S A HOLE
IN THE TOP OF THE PILLOW

LIKE, HOW DID YOU‐‐
YOU'RE VERY CLOSE, ACTUALLY.
UM, I‐I HAD SUFFERED AN INJURY.

00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,981
I WAS ON MY DEPARTMENT'S
S. W. A. T. TEAM

00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,317

THIS MIGHT BE
TOO MUCH INFORMATION.

THEY...

OH, THAT IS TOO MUCH.

00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:49,896
THAT IS TOO MUCH.
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. YEAH.
SO I HAD TO FINISH THE JOB,

00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:52,598
AND NOTICED THAT I WAS
EXTREMELY PALE ON THE CHEST

00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,834
AND DECIDED TO GO LAY OUT.
TO LAY OUT.

00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,104

EVERY SINGLE ONE OF 'EM‐‐

00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:20,059

WOULD COME TO ME AND SAY

"HEY. HOW MUCH ARE YOU SELLING
THOSE PILLOWS FOR?

00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:25,698

SO HOW MANY HAVE YOU SOLD?

00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:30,603
WE'VE SOLD JUST SHORT
OF 6,000 UNITS.
IN HOW‐‐IN HOW LONG
A PERIOD OF TIME?

00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:33,773
WE'RE ALMOST AT EXACTLY
OUR 2‐YEAR MARK.
HOW MUCH DO
YOU SELL THEM FOR?

00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:35,842
THEY RETAIL FOR $29.95.

00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:39,779
AND THEY COST
HOW MUCH TO MAKE?
MY COST, UM, IS AROUND $7.

00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:43,516
DO YOU HAVE ANY RETAIL
OR CATALOG DISTRIBUTION AT ALL?
YES, ACTUALLY, UM,

MAIL ORDER CATALOGS THERE IS‐‐

00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:54,193
AND I HAVE PURCHASE ORDERS RIGHT
NOW FROM THEM THAT I CAN'T FILL.

00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:56,996
SO YOU'RE SAYING,
RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE ORDERS

00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,698
THAT YOU CANNOT FULFILL?

00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:01,334
THAT'S CORRECT.
HOW MANY ORDERS DO YOU HAVE?

00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:04,370
WELL, THE TWO BIGGEST ONES ARE
BY LILLIAN VERNON AND SOLUTIONS.

00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,206
THEY MADE A FAIRLY LARGE
PURCHASE IN THE SPRINGTIME.

00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:09,308
I TOLD THEM THAT
"YOU'RE GETTING ALL I HAVE,"

00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:12,345
AND WITHIN ABOUT
LESS THAN A MONTH,

00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:15,481
THEY CALLED BACK AND SAID
"WE WANT TO PLACE ANOTHER P. O.,"

00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:18,284
AND I HAD TO TELL THEM "SORRY."

00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:21,554
LET'S BRING IT BACK
TO NUMBERS FOR A MINUTE

00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:24,090

THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE.
OKAY.

$250,000 FOR BASICALLY
A THIRD OF YOUR COMPANY

00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,763
IS WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR,
RIGHT?
THAT'S CORRECT.

00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:34,801
SO THAT'S $750,000 YOU THINK
THE WHOLE THING IS WORTH.

00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:38,838
YOU MADE ABOUT $21,000
LAST YEAR.

00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:40,840
YOU THINK THERE'S
A LITTLE DISLOCATION

00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,844

YOU'RE TELLING ME IT'S WORTH?

00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:47,313
SURE. I‐I‐I'LL AGREE
WITH THAT STATEMENT.

00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:48,815

00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:52,318
SO WHY WOULD YOU COME HERE
AND‐‐AND ASK SO MUCH FOR?

00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,620
BECAUSE I BELIEVE
THAT THOSE NUMBERS

00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,656
ARE... SMALL

00:15:56,656 --> 00:16:00,393
BECAUSE OF OUR LIMITED ABILITY
AND‐‐AND RESOURCES.

00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:03,696
BUT YOU WANT ME TO PAY
AS IF YOU ALREADY HAD MY MONEY.

00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:08,000
YOU'RE NOT LETTING ME
WET MY BEAK ON THE UPSIDE.

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,903
I GUESS IT'S A MATTER

00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,939
YEAH. FROM THIS SIDE.
RIGHT.

00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:16,342
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,578
HOW DO WE FIX THAT?

00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:21,380
I'M NOT SURE.
I'LL BE THE FIRST ONE TO ADMIT,

00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,017
I'M NOT A REAL NUMBERS GUY.
YEAH, THAT'S OBVIOUS.

00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,820
YOU'VE GOTTA HAVE
A BETTER ANSWER THAN,

"GEE, THAT'S YOUR OPINION"
TO KEVIN'S VALUE PROPOSITION.

00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,861
I‐I GUESS MY RESPONSE IS, YOU
KNOW, THE FACT THAT TINA AND I‐‐

00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:37,730
I MEAN, YOU ARE LOOKING
AT PODillow INCORPORATED‐‐

00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,932
WE‐‐WE‐‐WE PACKAGE THINGS
IN OUR GARAGE.

00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:42,068
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY
NO‐‐NO MARKETING BUDGET.

00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:44,070
AND YET, EVEN GIVEN
THOSE LIMITATIONS,

00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,639
IN THE LAST 2 YEARS, WE'VE MOVED
6,000 OF THESE THINGS.

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,275
AND I THINK THAT
WITH THE PROPER KNOWLEDGE,

00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:51,377
THE RESOURCES, THE KNOW‐HOW,

00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:54,180
I TRULY BELIEVE THIS PRODUCT
COULD TAKE OFF.

00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,350
BUT, ANTHONY,
THAT'S POTENTIAL,

00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,851
AND I APPRECIATE THAT,

00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:03,222
BUT IT'S NOT WORTH $750,000.

00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:06,492
IF YOU WENT TO
A VENTURE CAPITALIST COMPANY

00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:07,994
IN THIS ECONOMY,

00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:11,931
THEY WOULD PAY YOU A MULTIPLE
OF WHAT THE COMPANY EARNS.

00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:14,767
SO IF YOUR COMPANY EARNED
$20,000,

00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,470
MAYBE YOU'RE WORTH

00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,206
$100,000 TODAY.

00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:24,510
SO YOU'D HAVE TO SELL ME
250% OF YOUR COMPANY.

00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:29,315
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:32,385
THAT'S TOUGH MATH, RIGHT?
I SEE THE MERITS
OF THE PRODUCT,

00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,921
BUT THIS DISLOCATION BETWEEN
WHAT YOUR EXPECTATIONS ARE

00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:39,158
FOR ITS VALUE
AND WHAT I COULD PAY YOU FOR IT

00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:42,428
IS, UM, THE EARTH AND THE MOON.

00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,564

00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:33,932
UM, AND WE DO THINK THAT
IN A PRIME RETAIL LOCATION,

00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:36,068
IT COULD DO
NOTHING BUT FLOURISH.

00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:40,539
SO OPENING A SECOND LOCATION
WOULD GIVE US THE EXPERIENCE‐‐

00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,509
WAIT A MINUTE. THE FIRST
LOCATION ISN'T MAKING MONEY YET.

00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:45,611
SO HOW LONG

00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:49,281
ARE YOU GOING TO LET THIS RUN
BEFORE IT MAKES A PROFIT?

00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:51,717
GOING INTO THIS,
WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY RETAIL

00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:54,086
OR BUSINESS EXPERIENCE,
AND DOING A LOT OF RESEARCH,

00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:56,588
WE'D ALWAYS BEEN TOLD‐‐
ABOUT THREE TO FIVE YEARS‐‐

00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:59,158
IT'S GONNA BE TOUGH,
AND YOU'RE GOING TO STRUGGLE.

00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:01,693
OKAY, YOU'RE IN YEAR FOUR
COMING UP NOW, RIGHT?

00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:04,329
CORRECT. SO IT IS SOMETHING
WE DO THINK ABOUT.

00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:07,132
HOW MUCH MONEY HAVE YOU PUT IN
FROM THE BEGINNING?

00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:10,035
UM, ABOUT $120,000.

00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:14,006
WHERE DID YOU
GET THAT MONEY FROM?

00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:16,141
UM, HELP FROM, UM, FAMILY.

00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:18,444
FRIENDS, FAMILY, SMALL LOANS.

00:26:18,444 --> 00:26:20,979
WHAT IS YOUR HISTORY,
AND‐‐AND WHY DO I BELIEVE

00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:24,550
THERE'S A PASSION YOU HAVE
IN THIS?
MY MOM AND MY SISTER
ARE BOTH TEACHERS.

00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,051
I ADORE CHILDREN.

00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,687
(voice breaking)
AND I HAVEN'T FOUND A...

00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:31,390
(whispers) SORRY.

00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:35,928
WHY ARE YOU CRYING, KIMBERLY?

00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:38,764
(crying) I'M NOT SURE,
'CAUSE I AM PASSIONATE ABOUT IT.

00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:41,166
I HAVEN'T FOUND A JOB
THAT I'VE WANTED TO DO

00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:43,202
SINCE THE DAY THIS OPENED.

00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:47,906
I TRULY ENJOY
THE SHOPPERS COMING IN.

00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:51,076
I HAVE A GREAT TIME WITH THEM.
(sniffles)

00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:54,947
AND I THINK IT CAN SUCCEED.

00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:59,017
KIMBERLY, LOOK,
I GET THE‐‐THE PASSION PIECE,

00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:03,021
BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT I'D BE CRYING ABOUT?

00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:05,023
THE FACT
YOU'RE NOT MAKING A PROFIT.

00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:10,896
YOU KNOW, I‐I DON'T LIKE
TO THINK THAT WAY,

00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:14,666
BECAUSE I REALLY BELIEVE
IT CAN. UM...

00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:17,569
KIMBERLY, I'M GONNA ASSUME
50% GROSS MARGINS.

00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:22,608
YOU NEED TO DO $200,000
IN THIS STORE TO BREAK EVEN,

00:27:22,608 --> 00:27:26,745
TO PAY YOURSELF
AND YOUR BROTHER A SALARY.

00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:30,883
MORE, KEVIN. THEY NEED TO DO
FAR MORE THAN THAT.
AT LEAST. I'M SAYING IF YOU
JUST TOOK OUT $30,000 EACH.

00:27:30,883 --> 00:27:33,852
IT'S A HUGE ISSUE. FROM
AN INVESTMENT POINT OF VIEW,

00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:36,388
IT HAS NO MERIT,
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T PROVEN‐‐

00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:39,124
BEFORE YOU BUILD
A SECOND STORE‐‐

00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:41,760
THE FIRST ONE MAKES MONEY.

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,463
I LOVE KIDS, BUT THEY'RE
THE HARDEST THINGS TO SELL TO

00:27:44,463 --> 00:27:46,865
'CAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE
THEIR OWN CREDIT CARDS.

00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:49,968
ONCE WE GET THE PARENTS
IN THE STORE,

00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:52,504
THEY'RE HAPPY TO LET
THEIR CHILDREN SPEND MONEY,

00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:55,107
AND THEN THEY'RE PICKING UP
THINGS AS WELL.

00:27:55,107 --> 00:27:57,609
THERE'S NOTHING MORE EVIL
THAN A BUSINESS

00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:01,180
THAT DOESN'T CREATE A PROFIT.

00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,283
AND THE ONLY WAY TO FIGHT EVIL
IS WITH EVIL.

00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:07,319
YOU HAVE TO SHUT IT DOWN.

00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,354
I'M SORRY. IT'S THE TRUTH.

00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,657
AND FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.

00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:16,995
YOU STILL LEAVE
AT THE END OF A YEAR

00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:19,998
WITH $13,000, NO SALARY.

00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:22,768
YOU OWE YOUR RELATIVES MONEY.

00:28:22,768 --> 00:28:27,072
I JUST FEEL LIKE THIS IS
A HOBBY THAT YOU LOVE.

00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,942
BUT BY NO MEANS
IS IT A BUSINESS.

00:28:29,942 --> 00:28:33,845
I AM DEFINITELY, UH, OUT.

00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:40,118
KEVIN, I‐I DISAGREE THAT SHE
SHOULD SHUT THE BUSINESS DOWN.

00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,688
I THINK YOU'VE GROWN
THE BUSINESS, CORRECT?

00:28:42,688 --> 00:28:44,823
100% EVERY YEAR.
YES.

00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:47,960
SO TAKE‐‐TAKE THE NEXT YEAR.
DON'T GO FRANCHISE THE BUSINESS.

00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,463
I'D BRING MY SON THERE TO SHOP,
AND HE'D PROBABLY LOVE IT,

00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:54,733
BUT AS AN INVESTMENT, IT‐‐IT
WOULDN'T BE FOR ME, SO I'M OUT.

00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,536
SHAME ON YOU
FOR ENCOURAGING HER.

00:28:57,536 --> 00:29:00,038
WELL, AT THIS POINT,
YOU'RE FAILING.

00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:03,742
BUT FAILURE, TO ME,
IS JUST AN OPPORTUNITY

00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,878
TO BEGIN AGAIN MORE WISELY.

00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:09,748
I REGRET TO SAY IT‐‐
I'M OUT.

00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:16,088
IT'S AN ADMIRABLE IDEA,

00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:19,324
BUT PART OF WHAT KEVIN SAYS
IS‐‐IS RIGHT.

00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:22,127
ALL OF WHAT HE SAYS
IS RIGHT. 100%.
BUT...

00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:24,196
NO, 122%.

00:29:24,196 --> 00:29:28,433
IT'S HARD TO CALL SOMETHING
GEARED TO CHILDREN EVIL. UH‐‐

00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,403
THE <i>BUSINESS</i> IS EVIL.

00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:32,838
BUT, REALLY,

00:29:32,838 --> 00:29:35,240
THERE ISN'T ANY DATA

00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,244
THAT SUPPORTS EXPANDING
THIS BUSINESS TODAY.

00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:41,113
I'M OUT.

00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:47,185
KIMBERLY, I'M YOUR ONLY FRIEND
UP HERE.

00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:49,554
I'M THE ONLY ONE
TELLING YOU THE TRUTH.

00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:52,057
ALL THIS ENCOURAGEMENT
FOR YOU TO GO ON IS FOLLY.

00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:53,859
IT'S A HUGE MISTAKE.

00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:56,728
SOMEBODY'S GOTTA TELL YOU THAT.
IT'S NOT GONNA BE YOUR FAMILY.

00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:58,964
IT'S NOT GONNA BE
THESE PEOPLE CHEERING YOU ON.

00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:01,266
IT'S ME.
I DON'T THINK I‐‐I DON'T
THINK WE'RE CHEERING HER ON.

00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,302
I THINK THAT‐‐
I DON'T CARE, ROBERT.
IT MAKES NO MONEY.

00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:05,871
I THINK THE ONLY MISTAKE
THAT KIMBERLY'S MAKING

00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:09,107
IS THAT THE DATA IS TELLING HER
TO PERHAPS CHANGE DIRECTION.

00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:12,010
IS THAT ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING,
"SHUT IT DOWN?"

00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:17,182
AT THE VERY LEAST,
GO HOME TONIGHT,

00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:19,751
WRITE ON A PIECE OF PAPER

00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:21,753
THE DATE THAT YOU
HAVE TO BE PROFITABLE,

00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:24,022
AND BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF.

00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:26,858
YOU HAVE GOT TO
PUT A TIMELINE ON THIS

00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:29,661
BECAUSE IT'S YOUR FAMILY'S MONEY
YOU'RE BURNING,

00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,831
AND THAT I FIND EVIL.
I APPRECIATE
ALL OF YOUR, UM, OPINIONS,

00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:36,201
AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
(Daymond) GOOD LUCK.

00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:40,305
I MEAN, SHE WAS
REALLY PASSIONATE.

00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:44,309
YOU KNOW, THAT IS AN ANCHOR
ON HER LIFE. IT'S A TRAGEDY.

00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,478
(Harrington)
GIVE HER ONE MORE YEAR.
WHY?

00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:48,547
SHE MADE $13,000.
THAT WAS HER SALARY.

00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:52,284
YOU CAN'T LIVE OFF THAT.
WELL, MAYBE <i>YOU</i> CAN'T.

00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:54,820
SHE CAN'T EITHER. SHE'S LIVING
OFF HER FAMILY'S MONEY.

00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:58,623
THE BUSINESS WANTS TO DIE.
SAY THAT TO
THAT INNOCENT LITTLE GIRL

00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:02,294
STANDING THERE LOOKING AT YOU.
THAT KID HAS NO CREDIT CARD.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:04,996
(laughs)
SEEING A FAMILY'S MONEY
BEING BURNT,

00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:07,866
AND NOBODY DEALING
WITH THE TRUTH...

00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,835
EVEN YOU GUYS WERE OFFERING HER
ENCOURAGEMENT.
NOT TRUE. NOT TRUE.

00:31:09,835 --> 00:31:12,571
IT'S TERRIBLE.
I DON'T THINK SO.

00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:15,207
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY HERE
GAVE HER FALSE ENCOURAGEMENT.
YOU KNOW, I WILL BE ABLE
TO SLEEP TONIGHT,

00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:17,209
AND YOU WILL ALL
TOSS AND TURN.

00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:19,211
I THINK YOU NEED PASSION
TO SUCCEED.

00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,213
THERE IS NO SHORTAGE
OF PASSION IN ME

00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:23,982
OR ANYONE INVOLVED
IN WEE CAN SHOP.

00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:27,753

YOU KNOW, OUR FUTURE IS GREAT,

IT WAS ON ONE OF THESE
100‐MILE BIKE RIDES

00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:06,458
WHEN I GOT A FLAT TIRE.

00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:08,460

00:33:09,955 --> 00:33:11,456
I GOT A FLAT TIRE,

00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:36,775
PRIOR TO THE PRODUCT LAUNCH,

00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:38,944
AND CAME UPON ONE
THAT WE KNEW WAS NATURAL

00:34:38,944 --> 00:34:40,946
AND WOULD BE SAFE
FOR THE ENVIRONMENT

00:34:40,946 --> 00:34:42,547
AND WASN'T HARSH CHEMICALS.

00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:44,549
NOT ONLY CAN IT CLEAN
THE GREASE,

00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:47,619
BUT IT CAN ALSO CLEAN PERMANENT
MARKER, PAINT AND CRAYON.

00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:50,355
SO GREASE MONKEY WIPES
ARE PERFECT

00:34:50,355 --> 00:34:54,092
FOR THAT MOM WHOSE KID
IS ALWAYS GETTING INTO A MESS.

00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:57,228
ERIN, CAN YOU HOLD YOUR HAND UP?
I WANNA SEE HOW CLEAN‐‐
YEAH. ABSOLUTELY.

00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:59,798
SO I CAN SMELL THE ORANGE OIL
FROM HERE.
(Tim) CORRECT.

00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:02,167
(Barbara) IT SMELLS GOOD.
IT'S QUITE CONCENTRATED,
ISN'T IT?

00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:03,635
(Tim) YES.
(Erin) YEP.

00:35:03,635 --> 00:35:05,637
IF IT'S‐‐IF IT'S
A COMMON, UM, COMMODITY,

00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:07,639
A DERIVATIVE
OF MAKING ORANGE JUICE,

00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:11,509
COULDN'T I MAKE UNCLE KEVIN'S
CLEANY UPPY WIPEYS?

00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:14,079
LIKE, WHAT STOPS ME
FROM DOING THIS?

00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,947
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,

00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,949
THE PORTABLE NATURE
OF THE PRODUCT IS REALLY

00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,552
OUR UNIQUE, UM,
SELLING POINT.

00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:22,554
IS THAT PATENTED?
NO, IT IS NOT PATENTED.

00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:24,689
IS THERE ANY PATENT HERE?
NO.

00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:27,792
WE DECIDED NOT TO PATENT IT
REALLY FOR TWO REASONS.

00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,561
ONE, WE'RE
A BRAND‐NEW COMPANY,

00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:32,497
UH, SO WE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE
THE RESOURCES TO PATENT IT.

00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,799
AND SECOND,
ONCE YOU PATENT A PRODUCT,

00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,769
YOU HAVE TO PUT, UM, BASICALLY
YOUR FORMULAS OUT THERE.

00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:40,605
SO IT KIND OF PROTECTS US
AND, YOU KNOW,

00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:42,607
GIVES US SOME LEAD TIME, UM,

00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:45,610
TO GET SOME MARKET SHARE
AND GET IN THE PUBLIC MIND VIEW

00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,446
BEFORE SOMEONE COULD COPY US.
DON'T THESE EXIST PRETTY MUCH

00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:50,348
IN A LOT OF
DIFFERENT CATEGORIES ALREADY?

00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:53,184
THE OTHER STUFF IS VERY
INDUSTRIAL CHEMICAL HEAVY.
(Erin) RIGHT.

00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:57,055
YEAH, THAT'S ONE OF
OUR GREATEST DIFFERENTIATOR

00:35:57,055 --> 00:35:59,557
IS THE CITRUS FORMULA,
THE CITRUS SMELL,

00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:01,359
NO HARSH CHEMICALS,

00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,461
AND THE FACT YOU CAN BUY
ONE OR TWO AT A TIME,

00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:06,464
THROW IT IN
YOUR GLOVE COMPARTMENT.
I LIKE THE COLOR COMBINATION
YOU HAVE THERE.

00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:09,000
BUT IS THERE ANY TRADEMARK?
OUR LOGO IS TRADEMARKED.

00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,770
(Robert) IT'S THE BEST LOGO
I'VE EVER SEEN.
(Erin and Tim) THANK YOU.

00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:14,606
I LOVE THE BIKING SHIRT.
THANKS FOR SAYING THAT.

00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:16,441
ACTUALLY, WE GET A GOOD RESPONSE
FROM KIDS, TOO.

00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:18,443
ALL THIS WONDERFUL LOGO STUFF

00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:20,512
HAS TRANSLATED
INTO WHAT IN SALES?

00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:23,515
WE'VE ONLY HAD THE PRODUCT
ON THE MARKET FOR A FEW MONTHS,

00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,684
AND WE HAVE SOLD 7,600
GREASE MONKEY WIPES.

00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,886
AND HOW‐‐WHAT‐‐
IN DOLLARS, WHAT IS THAT?

00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:31,122
UH, OUR GROSS REVENUE IS‐‐
HAS BEEN $7,400.

00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:34,225
IT'S $1 A PACKAGE?
(Erin and Tim) YES.

00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:36,695
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT'S SUSTAINABLE?
WE‐‐ACTUALLY, WE DO.

00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:40,465
I MEAN, THERE'S 285 MILLION
REGISTERED CARS IN THE U. S.

00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:43,935
13 MILLION BOATS
AND OVER 6 MILLION MOTORCYCLES.

00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:46,971
SO THAT EXPONENTIALLY
GROWS OUR MARKETPLACE.

00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:49,107
FRANKLY, WE'VE HAD
A LOT OF LUCK SO FAR

00:36:49,107 --> 00:36:51,109
IN LITTLE NICHE MARKETS,
FOR INSTANCE, CYCLING.

00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:53,078
WE HAVE A 75% SUCCESS RATE

00:36:53,078 --> 00:36:55,080
OF STORES THAT WE PITCH
THIS PRODUCT TO.

00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,082
SO‐‐
AND THEN THEY REORDER
AGAIN AND AGAIN...

00:36:57,082 --> 00:36:59,250
YES.
OR IT'S TOO YOUNG TO TELL?

00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,252
UM‐‐
WE'VE HAD APPROXIMATELY 40%

00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:03,254
OF THE SHOPS
WE'VE SOLD INTO REORDER,

00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:05,256
BUT A LOT OF THEM
ARE REALLY NEW

00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:07,258
AND HAVE JUST RECEIVED
THEIR INITIAL ORDER,

00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:09,260
SO THEY HAVEN'T
BURNED THROUGH IT.

00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:12,530
AND SINCE WE ARE NEW, WE DON'T
HAVE THE HUGE NAME RECOGNITION

00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:16,134
TO REALLY DRIVE, UH,
THAT PART OF THE SALES.
(Daymond) YOU GUYS,
GREAT PRESENTATION.

00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:19,304
I LOVE THE BRANDING.
I LOVE YOU GUYS.

00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:22,040
IT'S JUST NOT
A BUSINESS FOR ME.

00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,375
I'M OUT.

00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:27,545
(Barbara) TIM, I FEEL I'M BEING
FOOLED A LITTLE BIT,

00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:30,048
NOT INTENTIONALLY SO,
BY THE LOOK YOU HAVE GOING ON.

00:37:30,048 --> 00:37:32,917
YOU LOOK LIKE A GREASE MONKEY‐‐
YOU KNOW, THE BEARD,

00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,953
THE WHOLE LOOK‐‐
BUT I FEEL LIKE YOUR,

00:37:34,953 --> 00:37:37,088
UH, PRESENTATION'S
PRETTY BUTTONED‐UP.

00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,224
DO YOU HAVE
A BUSINESS BACKGROUND?

00:37:39,224 --> 00:37:41,826
YES. I HAVE AN M. B. A.
IN MARKETING AND‐‐

00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:44,562
I WON'T HOLD THAT
AGAINST YOU.
OKAY, THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE THAT.

00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:46,898
(laughs)
BEFORE DOING THIS
FULL‐TIME, UH,

00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:49,567
I'VE BEEN IN PRODUCT MANAGEMENT
AND PRODUCT MARKETING,

00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:53,004
SO I DO HAVE
A SOLID BUSINESS BACKGROUND,

00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:55,006
BUT I'M MORE PASSIONATE ABOUT

00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:57,942
THIS AREA AND CYCLING
AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE.

00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,944
AND IT JUST SEEMS TO,
YOU KNOW, BALANCE OUT

00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,480
AND WORK PERFECTLY TOGETHER.
HE'S THE REAL DEAL.

00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,049
MY PROBLEM WITH THIS
IS THE, UH, LACK OF

00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:08,286
PROPRIETARY CONTENT.

00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:11,790
UM, THE‐‐THE ONLY THING
THAT'S UNIQUE,

00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,992
AND I THINK, MR. M. B. A.,
YOU KNOW THIS,

00:38:13,992 --> 00:38:18,196
IS THAT, UM, YOUR LOGO...
IS YOUR LOGO.

00:38:18,196 --> 00:38:20,465
AND IT'S PROPRIETARY.
NOBODY CAN TAKE THAT AWAY.

00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:23,134
BUT EVERYTHING ELSE
COULD BE KNOCKED OFF.

00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,370
I‐I LOVE THE WHOLE STORY.
I MEAN, IT'S TERRIFIC.

00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:28,373
BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE ONE OF
THE MOST IMPORTANT ATTRIBUTES

00:38:28,373 --> 00:38:30,375
THAT I LOOK FOR
IN AN INVESTMENT,

00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:33,545
AND THAT'S PROPRIETARY CONTENT,
SO FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.

00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,818
I LOOK FOR SOMETHING
THAT'S VERY, VERY UNIQUE

00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:43,021
AND THAT HAS
A UNIQUE SELLING PROPOSITION.

00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:45,990
I JUST DON'T SEE THIS BEING
UNIQUE ENOUGH IN THE MARKET,

00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,992
SO I'M OUT.
OKAY. THANK YOU.

A GREAT JOB PR‐PRESENTING TODAY.

A CLEVER LITTLE DEVIL.

UM... BUT I DON'T THINK I'VE
EVER GOTTEN MY HANDS DIRTY...

WARMING UP TO THIS THING.
