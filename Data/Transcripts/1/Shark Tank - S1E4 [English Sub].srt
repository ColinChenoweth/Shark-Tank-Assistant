00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:51,998
THIS GUY HAS SCREWED UP
MY DEAL,

00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,968
BUT HE'S DONE IT
IN A VERY GOOD WAY FOR YOU.

00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:57,737

AS YOU'RE TRYING
TO CHASE THE DREAM,

00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:05,278
YOU GET TO A CROSSROAD WHERE YOU
HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION.

00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,347
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TIMES.

00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:10,316
WHICH WAY ARE YOU GONNA GO?

00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:25,231

00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:29,836

00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:32,672

00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:36,676
I'M GONNA TAKE IT TO $200,000
FOR 50% OF THE BUSINESS.

TWO GREAT GUYS TO WORK WITH.

WHICH WAY ARE YOU GONNA GO?

00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:51,558
I WILL TAKE IT.

00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:54,461

THE RIGHT DECISION.
IT'S A GREAT DEAL.
IT'S A GOOD DEAL FOR YOU.

00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,396
(Daymond) GOOD DEAL.
(Robert) CONGRATULATIONS, KWAME.

GOOD LUCK, KWAME.

00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:12,345

IT'S A GREAT DEAL.
THIS GUY IS GONNA PULL IT OFF.

00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:15,014
(Barbara) GREAT DEAL.
YOU KNOW WHAT? WE COULD'VE
GOTTEN MORE FROM HIM.

00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:18,051
ROBERT, YOU MADE ME BE
A NICER GUY THAN I WANTED TO BE,

00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:20,687
AND THAT'S BAD.
DEEP DOWN, KEVIN,
I THINK WE'RE TWINS.

THE LINE REALLY KIND OF STARTED
OUT OF A HEALING PROCESS.

00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,987
IN 1997,
WHILE LIVING IN DALLAS,

00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:03,756
I SURVIVED AN ATTACK
IN MY APARTMENT.

00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:06,326

OF THE CRIME, UH,

00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:08,661
IT BECAME VERY HIGH PROFILE.

00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,830
AND MY STORY WAS TOLD
LOTS OF PLACES.

00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,266

I NOTICED SOMETHING‐‐

00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:15,235
THAT WHAT THIS ONE PERSON
HAD DONE TO ME,

00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,769
THIS ONE NEGATIVE ACTION,

00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,771
REALLY SPREAD OUT
AS A RIPPLE EFFECT,

00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:21,274
AND AFFECTED
LITERALLY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.

00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:24,277
AND I THOUGHT THAT IF SOMEBODY
COULD AFFECT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:25,778
WITH A NEGATIVE ACTION,

00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,780
THEN SOMEBODY COULD AFFECT
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

WITH A POSITIVE ACTION.

00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:31,918
AND SOUL'S CALLING
WAS BORN OUT OF THAT.

00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,721
IN 2004, I DECIDED
I COULD REALLY, MAYBE,

00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:36,856
POTENTIALLY MAKE
A BUSINESS OUT OF THIS.

00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,225
AND THE FIRST OBJECT
THAT I LAUNCHED WITH

00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:40,893
IS THE INSPIRELLA UMBRELLA.

00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,061

"LET YOUR SMILE BE SUNSHINE."

YOU KNOW, HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE
WALKED DOWN A NEW YORK STREET

00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:53,106
AND SEEN NOTHING
BUT BLACK UMBRELLAS?

00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,308
YOU KNOW,
THAT IS KIND OF DEPRESSING.

00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:57,343
AND IF SOMEBODY WERE TO CARRY
ONE OF THESE,

00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,145

MIGHT SEE THIS MESSAGE

IN A POSITIVE WAY.

00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:04,250

CAME THE CONNECTION BRACELET.

THEY SNAP TOGETHER.

TRADE SHOW THAT I WAS AT

GOING TO TAKE A BREAK.

00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,708
BUT CAN ANYONE ELSE
GET THAT PRODUCT

00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:46,178
WITHOUT THE G. R. S. FRANCHISE?
NOT IN A RETAIL OUTLET.

00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:48,914
THEY COULD BUY IT
FROM THE MANUFACTURER,

00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:51,016
<i>BUT</i> THEY DON'T KNOW
ABOUT IT.

00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:53,352
SO I GET THE CIVIC DUTY PIECE,
AND THAT'S GREAT.

00:25:53,352 --> 00:25:55,788
BUT WHAT ABOUT YOUR DUTY
TO MAKE MONEY FOR INVESTORS?

00:25:55,788 --> 00:25:59,425
HOW WOULD I MAKE MONEY
GIVING YOU $350,000?

00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:01,660
OFF ROYALTY FEES
AND FRANCHISE FEES.

00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,328
HAVE YOU SOLD ANY FRANCHISES?

00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:06,098
NO, SIR. I'VE ONLY BEEN APPROVED
THE LAST MONTH AND A HALF.

00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:08,300
HAVE YOU GOT
ANY REVENUES AT ALL?
YES, SIR, I DO.

00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,769
I HAVE MY COMPANY‐OWNED LOCATION
IN SACRAMENTO

00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:13,238
THAT NOW GENERATES
$230,000 A YEAR.

00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:17,409
WHAT ARE YOU NETTING
OUT OF THAT $230,000?
$75,000.

00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,412
PAUL, HOW MUCH DOES IT COST
FOR ME TO START‐UP‐‐

00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,448
TO BUY THE TRUCK,
BUY THE MACHINE?

00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:25,217
LIKE, THAT STUFF'S GOTTA
COST A LOT OF MONEY.

00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:28,320
OUR LOW END TO GET INTO
A G. R. S. FRANCHISE IS $60,000.
60 GRAND?

00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,790
OKAY, I‐I‐I BUY THAT THERE'S
A BUSINESS HERE, ALL RIGHT?
YEAH, AND I BUY IT.

00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,593
BUT THE PROBLEM IS,
YOU'RE TELLING ME

00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:37,896
THAT I GET 15% OF YOUR BUSINESS
FOR $350,000.

00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:40,232
I MULTIPLY WHAT
THE WHOLE BUSINESS IS WORTH

00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:42,201
BASED ON WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME
15% IS WORTH,

00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:44,403
AND THAT'S OVER $2 MILLION.
YES, SIR.

00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:47,372
AND YOU HAVEN'T SOLD
ONE FRANCHISE YET.

00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:48,874
NO, I BASED THAT

00:26:48,874 --> 00:26:50,876
OFF MY COMPANY LOCATION
IN SACRAMENTO

00:26:50,876 --> 00:26:52,444
AND THE RATE OF GROWTH.

00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,413
IT'S A HUGE NUMBER
YOU'RE THROWING OUT HERE.

00:26:54,413 --> 00:26:56,915
$2 MILLION? YOU HAVEN'T SOLD
ONE FRANCHISE YET.

00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,917
I MEAN, DOES THAT
REALLY MAKE SENSE?

00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:01,954
SO WHAT WOULD YOU THINK
A FAIR PRICE WOULD BE?

00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:05,657
I THINK I'D GET 110%
OF YOUR BUSINESS FOR $350,000.

00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:07,960
I THINK THE FRANCHISE
IS ALREADY DEVELOPED.

00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,461
IT'S ALREADY APPROVED.

00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,096
AND THE COMPANY HAS NO DEBT.

00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:13,599
WHAT I DON'T GET HERE IS,
THE GUY YOU SELL

00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:16,068
OR THE WOMAN YOU SELL
WHO DRIVES THAT TRUCK,

00:27:16,068 --> 00:27:19,304
HOW ARE THEY GONNA CONVINCE
A MUNICIPALITY

00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,707
TO EVEN CHANGE THEIR WAYS
AND TRY A NEW PRODUCT

00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:25,244
IN A GOVERNMENT SYSTEM
THAT'S NOTHING BUT RED TAPE?

00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:28,347
I DON'T GET THAT. I DON'T
BUY IT. AND FOR THAT, I'M OUT.

00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:31,150
(Harrington) PAUL, I HAVE
A FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM.

00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:35,454
YOUR SUCCESS IS GONNA BE BASED
ON YOU GETTING FRANCHISE FEES

00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:38,157
PAID ON A MONTHLY BASIS, OKAY?

00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:40,159
ONCE YOU PUT A GUY
INTO THIS BUSINESS,

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,694
WHY IS HE GONNA SEND YOU
A CHECK EVERY MONTH?

00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:45,264
HE KNOWS THE BUSINESS.
HE'S GETTING HIS ACCOUNTS.

00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:47,599
WHAT DOES HE NEED YOU FOR?

00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:50,068
AND I‐I DON'T THINK
THE FRANCHISE CONCEPT

00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:53,305
IS GONNA WORK
FOR THIS BUSINESS.

00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:55,474
ON THAT NOTE, I'M OUT.

00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:57,476
YOU HAVE
NOTHING PROPRIETARY HERE‐‐

00:27:57,476 --> 00:27:59,545
NOT‐‐NOT THE MACHINERY,
NOT THE IDEA

00:27:59,545 --> 00:28:02,748
OR NOT EVEN THE CHEMICALS.

00:28:02,748 --> 00:28:04,249
I'M SURE SOONER OR LATER,

00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:06,485
AS SOON AS YOU
MAKE THIS MORE POPULAR,

00:28:06,485 --> 00:28:09,454
THAT CHEMICAL COMPANY IS GONNA
MAKE IT AVAILABLE FOR RETAIL.

00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:12,457
SO I CAN JUST GO AND PICK UP
THAT BOTTLE FOR $2,

00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:15,227
SPRAY THE CRAP ON IT
AND WIPE IT AWAY.

00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:17,930

I THINK YOU'RE MAKING
A MISTAKE.
WHEN YOU WALK OUT OF HERE,
I WON'T EVEN THINK OF YOU AGAIN.

00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:28,734
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT.
YES, YOU WILL.

00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:31,203
NO, I WON'T.
YOU ARE DEAD TO ME.

NOPE. NEVER GONNA THINK‐‐

HERE'S OUR THOUGHT.

WE DON'T WANT TO‐‐WE DON'T WANT
TO GIVE UP CONTROLLING INTEREST

00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:40,225
OF OUR COMPANY.

00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:42,894
I COULD ASK FOR 50%
AND SAY LET'S BE EVEN.

00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:47,031
I ASKED FOR ONLY 40%
OUT OF RESPECT FOR YOUR TALENT.

00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:50,235
I JUST WANT TO BRING MY 35 YEARS
OF SAVVY BUSINESS EXPERIENCE‐‐

00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:53,238
I TOOK 1,000 BUCKS AND TURNED IT

AND BRING IT TO YOUR TABLE
TO HELP YOU.

00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:59,644
BUT WHEN YOU START TALKING
ABOUT EXPERIENCE,

00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:01,880
WE TALK A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE.

00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,282
SHE COULD RUN CIRCLES
AROUND ME

00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:08,386
IN ANY ASPECT OF REAL ESTATE.
WHICH HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THIS BUSINESS.

00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:11,589
WE ARE TALKING A DIFFERENT
UNDERSTANDING OF BUSINESS.
I'M WITH YOU, DAYMOND.

00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:13,958
WHAT IF YOU GOT
A LITTLE MORE CASH?

00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,461
IF YOU HAVE AN ISSUE
WITH THE 65%,

00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:20,665
WHAT IF I CAME IN WITH DAYMOND
AND GAVE YOU $450,000

00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:24,269
INSTEAD OF THE $350,000
FOR THE 65%?

00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:27,672

THAT BOTHERS US.

00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:31,042

(Amy laughs) OKAY, GOOD‐BYE.

00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,841
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.

00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:25,877
YOU GOT 'EM. YOU SH‐‐
YOU OUT‐SHARKED 'EM.

00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:28,846
BARBARA AGAINST
THE THREE OF YOU GUYS?

00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:31,416
HOW DID YOU GUYS LET BARBARA
TAKE DOWN THE THREE OF YOU?

00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:33,785
YOU KNOW WHY?
THEY WERE TOO GREEDY.
(speaks indistinctly)

00:42:33,785 --> 00:42:36,554
WELL DONE, BARBARA.
UNBELIEVABLE.
(Barbara) THANK YOU.

00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,022
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M CRYING.

00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:40,258
YOU KNOW, THE OPPORTUNITY,
IT JUST GAVE US HOPE, YOU KNOW,

00:42:40,258 --> 00:42:42,960
THAT THERE'S SOMEBODY
WILLING TO HELP US.

00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,831
AND THEY BELIEVE
THAT OUR PRODUCT IS JUST...

00:42:46,831 --> 00:42:48,833
IT HAS SOMETHING.
