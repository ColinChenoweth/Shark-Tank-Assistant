AND I LIVE IN CHICAGO
WITH MY WIFE JENNY.

00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:48,675
MY COMPANY IS ELEMENT BARS.
WE DO CUSTOM ENERGY BARS.

00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:51,311
SO THE INSPIRATION
FOR ELEMENT BARS WAS THAT

00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:53,513
I USED TO EAT AN OFF‐THE‐SHELF
ENERGY BAR AND THEN CRASH.

00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,916
SO I'D LOOK AT THE LABEL,
AND THE LABEL HAD A LIST

00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,918
OF COMPLETELY UNPRONOUNCEABLE
INGREDIENTS, AND I WAS LIKE,

00:01:57,918 --> 00:02:00,153
THERE'S GOTTA BE A BETTER WAY.

00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:02,522
I WANTED A BAR THAT WAS
WHOLESOME AND NATURAL

00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:04,591
AND CATERED
TO MY SPECIFIC TASTES.

00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:07,260
SO I STARTED MAKING MY OWN
ENERGY BARS IN MY OWN KITCHEN.

00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,664
AND THAT WAS PROBABLY
ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS AGO.

00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,332
AT THE CURRENT FACILITY,

00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:15,569
WE CAN MAKE FROM 12 BARS
TO THOUSANDS OF BARS A DAY.

00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:18,805
IN FACT, WE'RE SHIPPING
ABOUT A THOUSAND BARS PER WEEK,

00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,807

IN OUR OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY

00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,976
BUT WE'RE LOOKING TO GROW
TO THE NEXT STEP.

00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,978
SO TODAY'S ORDER
IS CRISPY CRANBERRY.

00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,547

THE "SWEET AND SMART BAR."

BECAUSE THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT
YOU'RE TELLING ME IT'S WORTH

WHEN YOU ASK ME
FOR $150,000 FOR 15%.

00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,853
SURE. SO WE STARTED
IN AUGUST 2008.

UNDERSTAND THAT. I UNDERSTAND.

I BELIEVE IT'S EXECUTION.

00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:55,922
I DO, TOO. SO HOW DO YOU GO
IN A YEAR AND A HALF

00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:59,259

TO $1 MILLION?

00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:02,762

IT'S WORTH THAT TODAY?

00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,331
NO, YOU DON'T.

IN YOUR KITCHEN OR WHEREVER,

00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:13,640
CAME UP WITH AN IDEA,

00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,810
YOU WANNA SAY
IT'S WORTH $1 MILLION.
I‐I GENUINELY BELIEVE‐‐

I MEAN, I ATE THE ENERGY BAR

(Daymond) YEAH.

00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:23,610
(Barbara) YOU NEED HIS FORMULA.
WHY DO WE NEED HIS FORMULA?
WE COULD FIND THAT.

00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,346
YOU CAN JUST GO TO A FACTORY

00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:28,581

VERY OFTEN, MY FRIEND.

00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,787
WHAT YOU SEE
ON THE WEB SITE

00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,023
IS ONLY THE TIP
OF THE ICEBERG, OKAY?

00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:12,058

RECIPES BEHIND THE BARS.

00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,693

00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,541
(O'Leary) UGH!
BUT I SELL MY BUSINESS.
I BELIEVE IN IT PASSIONATELY.

00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,543

A MINI SHARK.
OKAY.

00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:32,545

PERSONALLY.
OKAY.

THE MARKET IS THERE.

SOMEBODY'S GONNA KNOCK IT OFF.

THAT I CAN SURVIVE

00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,891
OFF MY SILLY INVENTIONS.

00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:02,128
♪♪

00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:14,040
I'M DAVID CHODOSH,

00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,342
AND MY PRODUCT IS CALLED
THE FIZZ.

00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:19,111
I'M HERE TO RAISE $150,000

00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:23,015
IN EXCHANGE FOR 25% EQUITY
IN THE PRODUCT.

00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,884
I'M A TOYMAKER,

00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:27,086
AND MY MISSION IS TO CREATE FUN,

00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,755
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES
TO FOOD.

00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:32,358
I DISCOVERED
THAT THE ROOT BEER FLOAT

00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,994
HAD REALLY BEEN LARGELY IGNORED
FOR 50 YEARS,

00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,464
SO I WANTED TO WAKE UP
THAT SLEEPING GIANT,

00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:41,334
AND I DID, BY CREATING THE FIZZ.

00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,069
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW IT WORKS.

00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:47,073
THE IDEA IS BUILT AROUND
THE BOTTLED SODA.

00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:49,575
OPEN THE SODA...

00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,478
AND A STRAW GOES INTO THE BOTTOM
OF THE FIZZ CUP.

00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,480
THIS ONE'S PRELOADED
WITH ICE CREAM.

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,551
THE STRAW HELPS IT, UH, DRAW
THE SODA IN A LITTLE EASIER.

00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:01,454
IT SCREWS ON TO THE TOP,

00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:03,890
AND WHEN YOU SQUEEZE
THE SODA IN,

00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,126
IT ACTUALLY STARTS TO FIZZ UP
INSIDE THE CUP.

00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:10,129
AND IF YOU WERE IN THERE,
YOU COULD HEAR THE FIZZING.

00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:11,831
(makes fizzing noise)

00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:14,734
JUST LIKE THAT...
(makes fizzing noise)

00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:17,169
AND YOU JUST DRINK.

00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,939
(gulps) MMM.

00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,741

00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:24,210

00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,137
YES, I DO.

00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:55,274
UH, LAST YEAR,
SALES WERE AROUND $84,000.

00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:57,410
WHERE DID THE SALES
COME FROM?

00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,413
ICE CREAM STORES, UH, VENDORS
AT, LIKE, STATE FAIRS.

00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:04,283
I ALSO HAVE PROVIDED MANY OF
THEM AS PROMOTIONAL PRODUCTS.

00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:08,421
I SUPPLIED, UH, UH, COCA‐COLA
WITH A, UM, AN ORDER.

00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,957
SO WHAT DID COCA‐COLA SAY
TO YOU?

00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:13,392
THEY LOVED IT.
THEY WANTED TO ORDER THEM

00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:16,028
FOR A, UH, GIVEAWAY PROMOTION.
AND?

00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:18,864

00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,466
PER SE.
AH.

00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:23,569
AND THE ICE CREAM
COMES FROM WHERE?

00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,571
THE ICE CREAM IS PROVIDED BY

00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:28,741
EITHER THE CUSTOMER HIMSELF,
WHO WOULD SCOOP IT IN AT HOME

00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:31,677
OR IN
A BEST‐POSSIBLE SCENARIO‐‐

00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,279
IS AN ICE CREAM MANUFACTURER

00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,715
WHO WOULD PREFILL THESE
AND SELL THEM

00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:38,050
IN THE FREEZER SECTION
IN‐‐IN STORES.

00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,820
NOW WHEN YOU WENT TO
THE ICE CREAM COMPANIES,

00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,588
THEY SAID TO YOU...

00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:45,391
I HAVEN'T REALLY DEMONSTRATED
BIG ENOUGH SALES

00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:47,259
TO GET THEM INTERESTED.

00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:50,129
BUT, DAVID,
FOR THIS TO BE BIG...
MM‐HMM.

00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,633
ISN'T THE REAL CHALLENGE
THAT YOU'RE NOT A SODA GUY

00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:56,068
AND YOU'RE NOT
AN ICE CREAM GUY?

00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:58,371
COULD SELL IT
IN THE FREEZER SECTION,

00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:01,107
LIKE, AT A CONVENIENCE STORE.
WITH THE ICE CREAM
ALREADY PACKAGED?

00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:04,110

BUT THEN WE'RE BACK
TO THE SAME STARTING POINT.

00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,545
YOU'RE NOT THE ICE CREAM GUY.

00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:11,150
THIS IS A SALE THAT YOU HAVE TO
MAKE TO A BIG CORPORATION.

00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,186
THAT ISN'T MY BUSINESS,
SO I GOTTA SAY, I'M OUT.

00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,391
I LIKE TO GO AND SCOOP IT

00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:22,695
AND ALSO BE ABLE TO DIG INTO
THE ICE CREAM SIMULTANEOUSLY.
SURE.

00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:25,965
SO I'M OUT.

00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:28,501

BE SELLING ROOT BEER FLOATS.

00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,139
YEAH, YOU REALLY DO.

00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:36,575

NOT BUYING IN. SO I'M OUT.

00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:44,684

00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:54,126

AS YOU YOURSELF SAID...
MM‐HMM.

00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:55,628

WHICH IS AN INFLAMMATORY
BOWEL SYNDROME

00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:18,003

SO AS THE ODORS WERE
REACHING MY NOSTRILS,

DIVORCE WAS NOT AN OPTION.

MOST PEOPLE, UH,
LAUGHED A LOT,

00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,748

"UH, IS THIS FOR REAL?"

00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:07,319

"YES, IT IS FOR REAL."

00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:12,424

I'M SITTING HERE THINKING,
WOULD I RATHER HAVE GAS

00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:54,159
OR WOULD I RATHER ELIMINATE
THE GAS

00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,161
AND WEAR THAT UNDERWEAR?

00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,197
AND I THINK I'D PICK
MY SEXY UNDERWEAR,

00:24:58,197 --> 00:25:00,933

I'D FEEL MEDICAL IN THOSE.

00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:40,151

TO STOP WASTING MONEY...
NO, NO, NO. I'M NOT SAYING‐‐

00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:43,722
AND PUT IT INTO A NEW BUSINESS,
ONE THAT MIGHT SUCCEED.
LOOK, LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING
YOU TOLD HER THE WRONG THING.

00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:46,725
WHAT I'M SAYING TO YOU IS,
YOU COULD SEE IN THAT WOM‐‐
OH, YOU'RE SAYING MY STYLE‐‐

YOU DON'T LIKE MY STYLE

HANG ON A SEC. YOU COULD
SEE IN THAT WOMAN'S‐‐

I DON'T LIKE TO WASTE WORDS.
COME ON, THAT WOMAN PUT HER LIFE
INTO THIS FOR THREE YEARS.

00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:55,467
YOU COULD SEE IT IN THAT.
ROBERT, SO WHAT?
THIS IS BUSINESS.

00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:58,570
LIFE IS HARD,

ENOUGH. CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN.

WELL, THERE'S A DIFFERENT WAY

NO, I DON'T WANT...

00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:08,647
ABSOLUTELY.
TO GIVE ENCOURAGEMENT
WHERE THERE IS NONE.

00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:12,384
WHEN YOU'RE DYING,
YOU HAVE TO BE TOLD THE TRUTH.
YOU CAN KILL THE IDEA BUT YOU
CAN ENCOURAGE THE PERSON.

00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:15,954
I TOLD HER TRUTH AND I'M PROUD
TO DO IT, AND I'LL DO IT AGAIN.
WELL...

00:34:15,954 --> 00:34:18,456
THAT'S IT. END OF STORY.

WELL, IF YOU NOTICE ON THE,
UH, FAR SIDE OF THE TABLE,

AT HALF A MILLION DOLLARS.
THEY'RE JUST JOKING ABOUT THAT.

00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:42,794
I KNOW THEY'RE NOT SERIOUS.
ONE OTHER THING
ABOUT THIS PRODUCT

00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:46,064
IS THAT IT'S ALL‐NATURAL
WITH NO PRESERVATIVES.
I LOVE THE WAY HE DID THAT.

00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:49,768
HE DIDN'T ANSWER YOUR QUESTION,
JUST LIKE A POLITICIAN.
OH, NO. NO, HE WENT RIGHT ON.

00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,870
HE WENT TO THE NEXT ONE.
WHAT‐‐WHY DON'T‐‐

00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:54,639
WHY DON'T YOU ANSWER HIS
QUESTION ABOUT YOUR VALUATION?
WE JUST SCORED A HUGE DEAL

00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:57,909
TO HAVE OUR PRODUCTS DISTRIBUTED
IN MAJOR GROCERY STORE CHAINS,

00:37:57,909 --> 00:38:01,579
AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE 10,000
UNITS IN PRODUCTION RIGHT NOW

00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:05,784
HEADING OUT TO STORES
NEXT MONTH.
FOR THAT 10,000 UNITS,
WHAT'S THE DOLLAR SIZE?

00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:08,787
IT COSTS US $2
TO PRODUCE THE RUB,

00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,789
$1.80 TO PRODUCE THE SAUCE.

00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,591

A 50% PROFIT BUILT IN.

VERY CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATES,

A LITTLE SECRET.

00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,809
I WAS AN INVESTOR
IN A BARBECUE SAUCE COMPANY

00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,811

IT TASTED GREAT.

00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:35,780

TO MY MONEY? IT'S GONE.

00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,449

00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:43,755

HARD COPY ORDERS.

00:38:43,755 --> 00:38:45,156
RIGHT.

CONSERVATIVELY...
CORRECT.

00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:51,262

PROJECTIONS AND HIS EXPERIENCE

TO COME UP WITH REAL
AND CONSERVATIVE‐BASED NUMBERS.

00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:13,017

IS PURELY ONE OF DISTRIBUTION.

00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,086

ALL ABOUT MARKETING.

00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:19,057

HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD.

00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,331
THE KEY TO THIS
IS DISTRIBUTION.

00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:28,900
YOU'RE PROJECTING
$4 MILLION IN SALES,

00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,903

DOESN'T SELL?

00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:33,905
IF IT FLIES, YOU MAY
GO TO THE MOON. OKAY?

00:39:33,905 --> 00:39:36,808

TO BE ABLE TO OWN
AND RUN THEIR OWN COMPANY.

00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:22,987
THIS IS ABOUT MAKING MONEY
FOR US AND FOR OUR FAMILY.

00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:24,656
NO, I UNDERSTAND THAT.
BUT, I MEAN,

00:40:24,656 --> 00:40:27,392

IT'S A COMPLIMENT.

00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:18,810
I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE
YOU CAN TAKE IT.
ONLY A POLITICIAN WOULD
TAKE THAT AS A COMPLIMENT!

THE NUMBERS ARE CRAZY.

00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:25,883
WHAT ABOUT THE $50,000?

00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:28,619
I DON'T SEE THAT AS A LOT OF
MONEY TO PRODUCE MUCH PRODUCT.

00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:32,957
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
THE $50,000 RUNS OUT?

00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:35,727
I THINK THE‐‐THE REVENUE
THAT WE'LL GENERATE,

00:41:35,727 --> 00:41:38,196
PLUS WE ACTUALLY HAVE ANOTHER
$100,000 OF OUR OWN MONEY

00:41:38,196 --> 00:41:41,766

OH, REALLY?

00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:44,702

I'LL BE HAPPY TO GIVE YOU
THE $50,000, ALL RIGHT?

00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:54,579
BUT FOR 50% OF THE BUSINESS.

00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:57,515
