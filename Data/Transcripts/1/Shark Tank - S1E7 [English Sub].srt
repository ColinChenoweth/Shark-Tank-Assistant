HARRINGTON.

KICKED ME OUT OF THE DEAL?

00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:20,960

00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,741
LESLIE, LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION.

00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,777
WHEN YOU STARTED
YOUR BUSINESS...
YES.

00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,912
DID YOU START IT
TO GIVE UP HALF OF IT?

00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,881
I BUILT MY BUSINESS
OUT OF MY HOUSE

00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:17,350
WITH CREDIT CARDS BY MYSELF...
RIGHT.

00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,120
AND SOLD IT FOR $150 MILLION,
WHICH MAY BE SMALL TO KEVIN,

00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,988
BUT I OWNED 100% OF IT.
LESLIE, WE ALL DID THAT.

00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,257
LESLIE, LISTEN TO ME
FOR A SECOND.

00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:25,892
THESE NUMBERS
ARE ROUNDING ERRORS.

00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:28,294
I SOLD MY BUSINESS
FOR $3.2 BILLION.

00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,097

TO SCREW YOU ON A ROYALTY.

00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:34,067

00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:36,202
ALL RIGHT, LESLIE,
WE HAVE TWO DEALS...

00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:39,672

KEVIN'S DEAL IS A WASTE OF TIME.

00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:43,209

AND TALK ABOUT MONEY NOW.

00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:05,437
THAT WAS FUN...
OKAY, GO SIT OVER THERE.

00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:08,374
BUT NOW IT GETS TOUGH, DEDE.
BUT I JUST PROVED
THAT YOU CAN DO IT.

00:25:08,374 --> 00:25:10,409
DO YOU HAVE ANY SALES
RIGHT NOW?

00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:13,012
NOT FOR THE DVD PORTION
OF OUR BUSINESS, NO.

00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:15,447

A D‐‐
FOR ANY PORTION, ANY PORTION.

00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:17,449

OF OUR BUSINESS

00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:20,319
THAT IS CERTIFYING INSTRUCTORS,
TEACHING LIVE CLASSES,

00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:23,022
DOING WORKSHOPS
FOR OUR STUDENTS.

00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:26,025
THAT PART OF OUR BUSINESS, YES.
WE HAVE BEEN GROWING THAT.

00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:28,761
WE LAUNCHED THAT
IN OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR.

00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:32,464
KATHY, I WANT TO BE CLEAR.
YOU'RE SELLING ME ONLY THE DVD.

00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:34,833
'CAUSE YOU‐‐YOU SAID THAT
VERY SPECIFICALLY.
YES, YES.

00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,835
OKAY.
AND THE REASON WE DID THAT

00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:39,838
IS THAT WE BELIEVE 80% TO 90%
OF OUR OVERALL REVENUE

00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:41,840
IS GOING TO COME
DIRECTLY FROM THE DVD SALES.

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,076

IF ANY,

00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:47,012
COMES FROM THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE BUSINESS TODAY?

00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:50,883
UH, YEAR TO DATE,
OUR REVENUE IS $15,000.

00:25:52,618 --> 00:25:54,720
WHAT KIND OF FOLLOWING
DO YOU HAVE?

00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,923

00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:02,161

A MEMBER OF OUR TEST GROUP.
(Robert) HI, BRENDA.

00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,702
BRENDA HAS LOST
100 POUNDS HERSELF

00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:13,038

PUTTING OUT $700,000‐‐

00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:27,719
I LIKE THAT
JUST FLOWING OFF MY LIPS,

00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:29,955

00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:31,590
YES, IT IS.

00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,259
I'D HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
HOW I'D GET THAT BACK.

00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,596
OUR SALES, CONSERVATIVELY,

00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,032
WE HAVE ESTIMATED TO SELL
ONE MILLION UNITS

00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:41,667

00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:44,470
WE'VE COMPARED THAT TO WHAT
OUR COMPETITORS HAVE DONE‐‐

00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,505
BUT STOP RIGHT THERE.

00:26:46,505 --> 00:26:48,507
THEY SPENT A FORTUNE
PREPARING AN INFOMERCIAL

00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:50,175
AND THEN BUYING
THE MEDIA TIME‐‐

00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:52,277
AND THAT'S WHERE THE $700,000
COMES IN RIGHT THERE‐‐

00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,114
THE MEDIA TIME.
YEAH, BUT YOU WANT TO MOVE
A MILLION CDs.

00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:57,382
SOME OF THE TOP
RECORD ARTISTS TODAY

00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:59,384
ARE NOT MOVING
THAT AMOUNT OF CDs,

00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:01,954
AND THAT'S JUST MUSIC
TO LISTEN TO.

00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:05,057
$700,000‐‐IT'S A VERY HARD
NUMBER FOR ME TO HIT

00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:07,059
NOT KNOWING THIS BUSINESS.

00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:09,761

HAVE TO SAY...

00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:11,430
THAT I'M OUT.

00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:16,502
HOW MUCH IS THE PRODUCTION
OF THE INFOMERCIAL?

00:27:16,502 --> 00:27:18,203
$175,000.

00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:21,306
(Robert) KATHY, ISN'T THERE
ANOTHER WAY YOU COULD DO THIS

00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,909
INSTEAD OF BURNING THROUGH
$700,000?

00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:26,478
YOU KNOW, IS IT A GO BIG
OR GO NOTHING PROPOSITION?

00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:29,348
WE FEEL THAT THE RETURN
IS BETTER FOR EVERYBODY

00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:31,517
IF WE PUT THAT INVESTMENT IN
UPFRONT ON THE SALES.

00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:35,787
(Robert) YOU'RE ASKING ME
TO GIVE YOU $700,000,

CALLED MURDERING MONEY.

00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:18,864

INTO MONEY HELL.

00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:20,465
SO FOR THAT REASON,

00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:23,302

THINK OF THE BUSINESS?

00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:03,782
ONLINE SALES.
HOW PROPRIETARY
IS THIS PRODUCT?

00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:06,151
IS THERE A PATENT
OF ANY KIND ON IT?

00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,587
YES, MINE. IT HAS
A PROVISIONAL PATENT ON IT.

00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:10,222
WHERE ARE YOU
MANUFACTURING THIS?

00:33:10,222 --> 00:33:12,357
OUT OF MY KITCHEN
AT HOME, ACTUALLY.

00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:15,861
H‐HOW ARE YOU DOING THAT?
UH, IT'S MY MOM,
ME AND MY GIRLFRIEND‐‐

00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:17,829
YOU JUST COOK IT YOURSELF?
WE JUST
COOK IT OURSELVES, YES.

00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:21,299
WE CAN ONLY MAKE 12 CONTAINERS,
UH, PER 10 MINUTES.

00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,768
HAVE YOU APPROACHED
ANY TOY MAKERS?
WE HAVE AN OFFER‐‐

00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:26,771
HAVE YOU TRIED TO
LICENSE THIS TO PLAY‐DOH?
I HAVE BEEN CONTACTED
BY PLAY‐DOH, THOUGH.

00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:29,107
FOR WHAT?
ABOUT‐‐ABOUT THIS,
TO PURCHASE IT.

00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:31,543
WAIT. WAIT.
AND WHAT HAPPENED?

00:33:31,543 --> 00:33:34,012
AND WHAT DID THEY HAVE TO SAY?
THEY LOVE IT, THEY WANT IT,

00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,581
AND WE'RE‐‐
WE'VE BEEN NEGOTIATING

00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:39,484
BECAUSE THEY WANT
THIS PATENT.

00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:43,555
SO THE LARGEST PLAYER
IN THE SPACE CONTACTED YOU...

00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:45,156
MULTIPLE TIMES.
TO LICENSE YOUR PATENT.

00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:46,658
SORRY. MULTIPLE TIMES?
MULTIPLE TIMES.

00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:49,361
AND WHERE IS THAT NEGOTIATION
AT THIS POINT?

00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:52,998
AT THIS POINT, I WANT TO
CREATE JOBS IN MY COMMUNITY‐‐
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT.

00:33:52,998 --> 00:33:55,100
YOU WANT TO SIT
IN YOUR MOTHER'S KITCHEN TABLE

00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,568
BAKING THIS STUFF,

00:33:56,568 --> 00:33:59,204
WHEN THE NUMBER ONE GUY
IN THE WORLD IS CALLING YOU?

00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:01,940
ARE YOU NUTS?
NO, HE WANTS
THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD

00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,509
TO SIT IN HIS MOTHER'S KITCHEN
BAKING THIS STUFF.
WHY WOULD YOU BAKE
ONE MORE CUP OF THIS STUFF

00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:07,812
WHEN THE NUMBER ONE GUY ON EARTH
IS BANGING AT YOUR DOOR?

00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:09,247
BECAUSE I‐‐

00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,249
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT MOMENT
FOR YOU,

00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:14,386
'CAUSE IT'S GONNA TELL ME
WHETHER YOU'RE SANE OR INSANE.

00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:15,887
NO, BECAUSE HONESTLY,

00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,890
I REALLY FEEL THAT IF THEY
PURCHASE THIS PATENT FROM ME,

00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,726
WE WOULD NEVER SEE IT AGAIN
IN THE LIGHT OF DAY.
WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,728
(Robert) SAWYER‐‐
MAYBE THAT'S TRUE,
BUT HOW MUCH

00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,531
ARE THEY GOING
TO PURCHASE IT FOR?
THAT'S STILL IN NEGOT‐‐
NEGOTIATION.

00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:30,035
IS IT‐‐DO YOU NEED SOME HELP
IN NEGOTIATING THAT?
YEAH.

00:34:30,035 --> 00:34:32,470
HAVE THEY MADE YOU
AN ACTUAL OFFER?

00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,773
UH, THROUGH MY LAWYERS,
BUT NOT...
WHAT WAS THEIR PRICE?

00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:36,775
THERE'S BEEN
DIFFERENT OFFERS.

00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:40,111
THE HIGHEST HAS BEEN AROUND
$500,000.

00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:43,782
YOU HAD AN OFFER FOR $500,000?
YOU'RE A COLLEGE STUDENT‐‐

00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:45,784
BUT I REALLY FEEL
THAT IN A YEAR,

00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:47,285
TWO YEARS DOWN THE ROAD,

00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:50,121
I CAN HONESTLY SELL
12 MILLION OF THESE CONTAINERS.

00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:53,024
ARE YOU A WEALTHY GUY,
SAWYER?
NO.

00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:55,760
DIDN'T THE $500,000‐‐I'M JUST
CURIOUS‐‐DIDN'T IT TEMPT YOU?

00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,829
TEMPTED MY PARENTS, YES.
WHAT ABOUT YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:00,498
YES. (laughs)
(laughs)

00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,334
WHAT'S YOUR IDEA ABOUT
EMPLOYING PEOPLE?

00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:05,337
I JUST FEEL LIKE I DON'T HAVE MY
FINGER ON YOUR MOTIVATION HERE.

00:35:05,337 --> 00:35:07,339
MY MOTIVATION
IS TO CREATE JOBS,

00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:09,841
TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S
A PRODUCT FOR THESE‐‐

00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:11,343
ONE‐EIGHTH OF THE MARKET‐‐

00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:13,745
PLAY‐DOH CAN DO THAT.

00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:15,380
NOT WITH
A WHEAT‐FREE MAR‐‐

00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,816
YOU'RE SURE
YOUR PATENT EXCLUDES THEM

00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:20,685
FROM EVER DOING
A WHEAT‐FREE PRODUCT?
YES, YES.

00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:23,054
OUTSTANDING, YOUNG MAN.
OUTSTANDING.

00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:25,657
I RARELY SEE AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE
THIS FROM THE LICENSE FRONT.

00:35:25,657 --> 00:35:28,693
THIS IS
A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY.
THANK YOU.

00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:30,462
SAWYER‐‐OH.
SAWYER, I HAVE GREAT NEWS
FOR YOU.

00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:33,565
THANK GOODNESS WE'VE MET.
MY WHOLE BUSINESS CAREER

00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:36,468
WAS BUILT AROUND
LICENSING PROPERTIES.

00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:38,670
DONE IT HUNDREDS OF TIMES.

00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,672
I'LL GIVE YOU $125,000
FOR 51% OF YOUR PATENT.

00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:43,575
AND I'LL TELL YOU
WHY I'M DOING THAT.

00:35:43,575 --> 00:35:45,110
I'M DOING IT...

00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:48,913
TO TAKE YOU
OUT OF THE EQUATION.

00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:52,784
AND I PROMISE YOU,
YOU'LL GET A BETTER DEAL

00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:55,920
THAN THE ONE
YOU'RE GETTING RIGHT NOW

00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,890
WHEN I SIT DOWN
WITH YOUR FRIENDS AT PLAY‐DOH.

00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:02,694
SAWYER SAID NO TO HALF A MILLION
IN CASH FROM PLAY‐DOH.

00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:05,330
BUT YOU'RE PROPOSING‐‐
HE'S GONNA MAKE MUCH MORE
THAN HALF A MILLION

00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,932
WHEN I'M YOUR PARTNER‐‐
MUCH MORE, MUCH MORE.

00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:11,202
BUT YOU'RE TAKING CONTROL.
HE'S‐‐YES,
BECAUSE I SHOULD SIT‐‐

00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:14,039
SO YOU COULD SELL IT
FOR $600,000.
I DON'T‐‐

00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:17,208
THERE'S NOTHING HE CAN DO.
ROBERT, YOU'RE JUST
MAKING NOISE TO ME.

00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,878
LOOK, KEVIN‐‐
SAWYER, LET ME SWEETEN MY OFFER,
'CAUSE THIS IS NOISE.

00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:22,881
I'M TIRED OF LISTENING TO IT.
HERE'S A BETTER DEAL FOR YOU.

00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:26,384
WE'LL KEEP IT THIS WAY‐‐
51% AT $125,000,

00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:29,854
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO CLOSE
UNTIL I FINISH THE NEGOTIATIONS

00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,489
WITH THESE GUYS.

00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:34,426
IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE DEAL,
WALK AWAY.

00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:37,128
I'M GONNA BE
YOUR ADVOCATE RIGHT NOW,

00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:40,265
BECAUSE I KNOW ABOUT LICENSING,
BUT HONESTLY,

00:36:40,265 --> 00:36:43,168
I THINK HE IS GIVING YOU
AN INCREDIBLE DEAL.

00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:46,571
I'D CONSIDER THIS
WHAT WE CALL A "YOLO" MOMENT.

00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:49,674
YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE.

00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:51,943
ALL RIGHT?
YES.

00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:53,945
AND TO MAKE SURE
THAT I DON'T COMPETE,

00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:56,214
'CAUSE I THINK THAT IS
A REALLY GOOD DEAL...

00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:59,117
I'M OUT.

00:36:59,117 --> 00:37:01,753
I'M GONNA GET RID
OF THE CLUTTER.

00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:04,389
UM, I THINK A SPECIALIST
IN LICENSING

00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:07,292
LIKE KEVIN O'LEARY IS‐‐
IS A GOOD PARTNER TO HAVE,

00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:09,294
SO I‐‐I'M GONNA BOW OUT.

00:37:09,294 --> 00:37:11,362
OKAY.
HE'S THE NATURAL PARTNER
FOR YOU,

00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:14,332
AND I DON'T EVEN LIKE THE GUY,
SO FOR ME TO ENDORSE HIM

00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:16,334
IS SHOCKING TO MYSELF.
I'M OUT.

00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:21,106
SO YOU JUST WANT TO RAISE
SOME CASH TO DO WHAT?

00:37:21,106 --> 00:37:24,442
UH, TO BUILD A FACILITY
IN MY COMMUNITY.

00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:26,444
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
MY FRIEND,

00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:28,947
I'VE BEEN RICH
AND I'VE BEEN POOR.

00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:32,050
RICH IS MUCH BETTER,
AND I WANT TO GET YOU THERE.

00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:34,285
YOU'LL FIND MANY WAYS
TO CREATE JOBS

00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:36,888
WHEN YOU HAVE THE CAPITAL
TO BUILD BUSINESS.

00:37:36,888 --> 00:37:39,791
COULD I ASK YOU A QUESTION?
YES.

00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:42,861
HOW MUCH DO YOU LOVE MONEY?
DO YOU LOVE IT AS MUCH AS I DO?
PROBABLY NOT.

00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:44,863
I'M STILL IN COL‐‐
I'M A COLLEGE STUDENT AND...

00:37:44,863 --> 00:37:47,665
(laughs)
I JUST NEED MONEY
FOR BEER, I GUESS,

00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:50,268
IS WHAT THIS IS.
(sharks laugh)

00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,337
(O'Leary)
THIS IS SUCH WHAT I DO.

00:37:52,337 --> 00:37:55,073
THIS IS IN MY BLOOD,
WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE.

00:37:55,073 --> 00:37:57,075
THERE'S NO PERSON
BETTER ON EARTH

00:37:57,075 --> 00:38:00,044
TO BE IN YOUR SHOES THAN ME.

00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:02,914
BELIEVE ME. WE NEED TO BE
PARTNERS ON THIS.

00:38:02,914 --> 00:38:05,617
ARE WE GONNA BE IN BUSINESS
OR NOT?

00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,619
I LOVE YOUR OFFER.

00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,121
AND I DEFINITELY FEEL
THAT I DO NEED HELP,

00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,624
UH, WITH THIS, AND, UH,

00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:15,026
BUT NOT FOR 51%.

00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:16,528
♪♪

00:38:16,528 --> 00:38:21,533
COULD YOU DO $125,000
FOR 40%?

00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:23,001
HERE'S THE PROBLEM‐‐

00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:25,003
LET ME EXPLAIN THE PROBLEM.

00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:27,472
UM...

00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:29,841
THE REASON I NEED 51%

00:38:29,841 --> 00:38:32,644
IS, WHEN I BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS,

00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:34,979
THE OTHER SIDE HAS TO KNOW

00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,981
THAT I HAVE
THE ABILITY TO CLOSE.

00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:40,084
BUT I COULD STILL GIVE YOU
THE ABILITY TO CLOSE ON‐‐

00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:42,487
NO. YOU SEE,
HAVING NEGOTIATED THIS LICENSE

00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:44,489
HUNDREDS OF TIMES BEFORE,

00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,357
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TRUST ME.

00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:49,561
I WOULD NEVER, EVER DO THIS
WITHOUT HAVING THE ABILITY

00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:52,564
TO GO IN THERE
AND COME BACK WITH A DEAL

00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:54,065
THAT'S SIGNIFICANTLY SUPERIOR.

00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:56,367
IF YOU TELL ME
ONE OF THE ATTRIBUTES

00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:59,370
IS YOU HAVE TO CREATE JOBS,
I'LL GET THAT FOR YOU.

00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:02,273
I AM WILLING TO BEND OVER
BACKWARDS TO GET YOU HAPPY

00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:04,275
IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE DEAL,

00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:06,811
BUT I HAVE TO WALK IN THERE
WITH 51%,

00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:09,247
AND I SWEAR,
I'LL COME OUT OF THERE

00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:11,883
WITH SOMETHING
YOU CAN'T EVEN DREAM OF.
SAWYER, IT'S A GREAT SPEECH...

00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:13,885
AND IT'S TRUE.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, SAWYER?

00:39:13,885 --> 00:39:16,387
I ALMOST BELIEVED
IT FOR A SECOND.

00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:18,389
BUT I THINK YOU DID
AN EXCELLENT JOB TODAY

00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:20,758
OF SEEING THROUGH
THE FLUFFINESS

00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:22,760
AND INTO WHAT IT REALLY IS,
JUST GREED.

00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:27,298
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $125,000
FOR THE 40%.

00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:31,436
SO WE'RE‐‐WE'RE‐‐
(whimpers) I'M GONNA CRY.
I CAN'T TAKE IT.

00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:41,512
<i>SAWYER HAS TWO OFFERS</i>
<i>ON THE TABLE.</i>

00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:44,215
<i>KEVIN O'LEARY</i>
<i>HAS OFFERED $125,000</i>

00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:47,018
<i>FOR 51% OF THE COMPANY.</i>

00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:48,586
<i>BUT ROBERT HAS OUTBID HIM,</i>

00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:51,689
<i>OFFERING THE SAME AMOUNT</i>
<i>FOR ONLY 40% OF THE COMPANY.</i>

00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:53,925
WHAT'S YOUR‐‐
WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?

00:39:53,925 --> 00:39:56,227
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WAIT, WAIT. HE'S NEVER, EVER‐‐

00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,229
I'VE DONE WHAT I'VE
JUST DESCRIBED TO YOU

00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,331
A HUNDRED TIMES, AND THE PROOF
IS IN THE PUDDING.

00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:03,101
MY ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT
I NEED‐‐I NEED OWNERSHIP.

00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:05,336
I DON'T WANT OWNERSHIP.

00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:08,006
WHAT I WANT IS THE ABILITY
TO CLOSE.
WITH 51%.

00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:10,508
I‐‐
YOU CAN'T CLOSE IF YOU
OWN LESS THAN 51?

00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:12,877
LIKE, THAT DOESN'T EVEN
MAKE SENSE?
NO, IT DOES MAKE SENSE.

00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:15,013
THE REASON YOU DON'T KNOW THIS
IS YOU'VE NEVER DONE IT,

00:40:15,013 --> 00:40:17,649
WHICH IS WHY HIS OFFER
IS USELESS TO YOU.

00:40:17,649 --> 00:40:19,684
OKAY.
YOU NEED A GUY
THAT'S ACTUALLY DONE IT.

00:40:19,684 --> 00:40:22,420
SAWYER, I'M NOT‐‐I'M NOT...
(Daymond) YOU HAVE
TWO OFFERS ON THE TABLE.

00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,556
I'M NOT GONNA SELL YOU THAT
HARD. I DON'T FEEL I NEED TO.
RIGHT.

00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:28,226
I THINK YOU'RE A SMART GUY.
I THINK YOU DID A GOOD JOB.

00:40:28,226 --> 00:40:30,762
I THINK THAT, UH, YOU'RE
VERY CLEAR WITH WHAT YOU WANT.

00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:33,865
WITH THAT OFFER, WHAT‐‐WHAT IS
YOUR PLANS WITH THIS BUSINESS?

00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:35,867
I MEAN, I THINK
THAT MY PLAN WITH IT

00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:38,503
IS TO KEEP DOING
WHAT YOU'RE DOING,

00:40:38,503 --> 00:40:41,439
NEGOTIATE HARD WITH PLAY‐DOH
AND TRY TO GET MONEY.

00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,408
I'M REALLY IMPRESSED
BY WHAT YOU'VE BUILT.

00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:45,410
IT'S $125,000.
