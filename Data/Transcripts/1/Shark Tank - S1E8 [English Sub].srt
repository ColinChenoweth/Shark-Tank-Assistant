YOU SIGN UP EVERY SINGLE COLLEGE
BASE OF STUDENTS YOU CAN,

00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:18,898
YOU DELIVER ME
THAT $20 MILLION,

00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:22,569
AND I'LL TAKE YOU PUBLIC.

00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:26,239
OR I'LL SELL YOU TO A STRATEGIC
AND MAKE YOU FILTHY RICH.

00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,975
OR YOU COULD KEEP
THAT 1% FOR YOURSELF,

00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:32,112
AND I'LL TAKE 50%
OF THE BUSINESS FOR $90,000.

00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,114
BARBARA, WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO DO WITH THIS?

00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:37,017
WHAT‐‐YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY
NO BUSINESS HERE.

00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,052
I HAVE EVERY BUSINESS
BEING HERE. YOU KNOW WHY?

00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:41,087
THE SINGLE BEST BUSINESS DEAL
I'VE EVER MADE

00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,089
WAS WHEN I USED TO TRADE

00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:46,326
MY ENGLISH DIAGRAMS IN ENGLISH
CLASS FOR MATH HOMEWORK.

00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:48,995
(all laugh)
AND I DID IT FOR SIX MONTHS,

00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:51,464
AND I GOT GOOD GRADES
UNTIL I GOT CAUGHT.

00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:55,035
ABSOLUTELY DON'T NEED YOU
NEAR THESE GUYS.
IT WORKS. THAT WAS ILLEGAL.
THIS IS LEGAL.

00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:59,773
YOU'RE GONNA CORRUPT
THESE YOUNG MINDS, BARBARA.
NOT AT ALL.

00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:02,976
RIGHT NOW IT'S 51%
FOR $90,000

00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:06,713
FROM SOMEONE WHO'S DONE IT
TO THE TUNE OF $3.2 BILLION.

00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,715
LET THAT ROLL OFF YOUR LIPS‐‐
BILLION, BILLION‐‐

00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,017
AS YOU‐‐
SEAN, BEFORE I HEAR

00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,787
THAT "BILLION AND BILLION
AND BILLION," KEEP IN MIND,

00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:17,590
THERE'S ONE VERY, VERY
IMPORTANT THING. DON'T EVER...
DO YOU HAVE AN OFFER
ON THE TABLE, ROBERT...

00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,626
DON'T EVER BE...
OR IS IT JUST NOISE?

00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,728
DON'T EVER BE ENAMORED
BY WHAT SOMETHING SELLS FOR.

00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:25,632
IT'S MORE IMPORTANT WHAT YOU GET
TO KEEP IN YOUR POCKET.

00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:29,069
(D.J.) OF COURSE.
I DIDN'T SELL MY COMPANY
FOR <i>BILLIONS</i> OF DOLLARS,

00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:34,107
BUT I HAD 100% OF THE EQUITY
WHEN I DID SELL MY BUSINESS.

00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:37,911
IT'S ABOUT WHAT GOES
INTO YOUR POCKET.
ARE YOU JUST TRYING
TO BOTCH HIS DEAL?

00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:41,247
(O'Leary) IT'S JUST‐‐
IT'S JUST NOISE.

00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,716
IS THIS YOUR FIRST VENTURE,
THE TWO OF YOU?
YEAH.

00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:46,453
I'M GONNA TELL YOU
RIGHT NOW, POO‐POO HAPPENS.

00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:48,455
STUFF YOU HAD NO IDEA
WAS GONNA HAPPEN TO YOU

00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:51,057
IS GOING TO HAPPEN,
BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN TO YOU,

00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,526
AND YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO ENDURE ALL THAT.

00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:56,196
AND I KNOW THAT'S GONNA OCCUR.
YOU'RE GONNA NEED MORE MONEY.

00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:58,898
I KNOW ALL THAT ALREADY.
SO WE'RE GIVING 50% NOW,
BUT IF YOU'RE SAYING

00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,400
WE NEED MORE MONEY,

00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,769
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GIVE
ANOTHER 20%, 30% THEN.

00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:06,539
WE'RE NOT WILLING TO MAKE
THAT SACRIFICE.
WHAT‐‐OKAY, BUT LOOK,
10%'s LUDICROUS FOR 90 GRAND.

00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,708
WHAT'S YOUR COUNTER?

00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,945
SO WE WANT TO GIVE 15‐‐
15% OF THE COMPANY AWAY.

00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,947
15.
15. 15. 1‐5 NOT 5‐0.

00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,015
1‐5% FOR THE $90,000?

00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,318
FOR $90,000.
AND WE'RE GONNA GIVE

00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:21,321
AN INSURANCE POLICY
ON TOP OF THAT.
WHAT'S THE INSURANCE POLICY?

00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:24,324
24 MONTHS FROM TODAY, IF WE
DON'T HIT $1 MILLION IN REVENUE,

00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:28,128
SEAN AND I WILL GIVE YOU
OUR PORTION OF THE COMPANY.

00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:32,031
NOW I LOOK AT YOU AS GUYS
THAT ARE JUST LIKE ME WITH HAIR,

00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,733
20 YEARS AGO.

00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,703
I'M JUST GONNA TAKE A TASTE
OF YOUR FLESH, NOT ALL OF IT,

00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:39,139
'CAUSE I WANT YOU
TO STAY MOTIVATED.

00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:43,676
I WOULD DO THE DEAL
FOR 35% FOR $90,000.

00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,512
(mouths words)

00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:48,781
THIS GUY WILL EAT YOU FOR
BREAKFAST AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY.

00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:51,317
IF YOU'VE GONNA
BE EATEN FOR‐‐
EVERY LITTLE NICHE AND A TURN,

00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,753
HE'LL BE GRABBING
SOME MORE STOCK.

00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:55,788
AND BELIEVE ME,
HE'S AN ANIMAL.

00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:59,626
I HAVE NO DOUBT IN MY MIND YOU
GUYS HAVE A HOME RUN HIT HERE.

00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:01,794
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:04,631
I'M GONNA OFFER YOU 25%
FOR THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY‐‐

00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:06,966
$90,000. I THINK YOU
SHOULD TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY.

00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,536
DEFINITELY WILL. THANK YOU.
AND I DON'T WANT
YOUR GUARANTEE.

00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:12,205
SO, SEAN, I THINK
THAT YOU AGREE WITH ME

00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,140
THAT THERE IS VALUE
IN HAVING EXPERIENCE.

00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,142
THE KEY
TO INTERNET BUSINESSES‐‐

00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:18,945

SO NOW YOU HAVE TO MAKE

00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,353
BEFORE YOU MAKE THE DECISION‐‐

00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,622
BECAUSE I THINK
MY LACK OF EXPERIENCE

00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,892
HAS BEEN HIT UPON HERE, AND I
THINK THAT'S ENTIRELY UNFAIR.

00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,594
BECAUSE IT'S THE TRUTH.

00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:17,864
COME ON. I INVESTED
IN A YOUNG GUY FIVE YEARS AGO,

00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:20,500
WHEN HE WAS DESPERATE FOR MONEY
ON AN INTERNET PLAY.

00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,503
I GAVE HIM ONLY $100,000.
THAT'S ALL HE WANTED.

00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:26,806
EVERY DOLLAR I'M SPENDING
ON THE "SHARK TANK"

00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,808
IS A RESULT OF THAT
SMART INVESTMENT.

00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,178
AND, YOU KNOW, THE ONLY THING
I KNEW ABOUT THE GUY

00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,680
IS HE WAS A WINNER.

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,181

00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:16,689
AND IF YOU DO,
YOU GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK,

WE JUST KNOCKED US‐‐
OUR EQUITY DOWN

OF BOZO BARBARA?

00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:55,628

YES. THAT WAS AWESOME.
IT WAS AWESOME.

00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:54,046
(D.J.) IT WAS FUNNY. YEAH.

00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:57,016
BARBARA‐‐SHE‐‐SHE HAD CONFIDENCE
IN US FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.
RIGHT. RIGHT. THAT'S‐‐

00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,685
YOU KNOW, SHE WASN'T TRYING
TO HIGH‐‐LOWBALL US WITH 50%‐‐

00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,188
HOLD ON. HOLD ON.
HOLD ON, GUYS.
HO‐‐OH.

00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,924
LISTEN, WHAT HAPPENED IN THERE
WAS INSANE.

00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:08,027
YOU JUST MADE A DEAL
WITH A REAL ESTATE AGENT.

00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,197
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE TO YOU? SHE
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE DID.

00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,366
I'M GONNA SEND HER OFF
FOR THERAPY OR SOMETHING,

00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:16,068
BECAUSE THAT WAS INSANE.
IF YOU WERE IN OUR SHOES,

00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:18,671
YOU WOULD'VE REALLY TAKEN
35% FOR $90,000?

00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:20,673
AND LOOK,
I'M NOT SAYING I BLAME YOU,

00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:23,175
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHO THE SHARK IS HERE.

00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,177
I THINK IT'S YOU.
(laughs)

00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:27,680
I DON'T THINK SO.
I DON'T THINK SO.
YEAH, I THINK SO.

00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,650
ANYWAYS, I JUST WANTED
TO CONGRATULATE YOU GUYS.
YEAH, THANK YOU.

00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,686
I THINK IT'S A FANTASTIC
BUSINESS. GOOD LUCK WITH YOU.
THANK YOU, KEVIN.

00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:35,688
BUT I JUST‐‐IT‐‐IT'S‐‐
THAT NEVER HAPPENS TO ME,

00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:38,190
SO IT DIDN'T SIT WELL WITH ME.
THAT'S WHY I CAME IN HERE.

00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,692
ANYWAYS, GOOD LUCK.
THANK YOU.

00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,928
THANKS.
WE PICKED BARBARA,

00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:43,930
BECAUSE SHE WAS AUTHENTIC
WITH US FROM THE BEGINNING.

00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,932
KEVIN WAS TRYING
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US,

00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:48,234
AND WE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
WITH OUR DECISION.

00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:51,771

00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:54,173

00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:57,810
<i>AND WATCHED AS THEY MADE</i>

00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,980
<i>WITH BARBARA CORCORAN.</i>
TIME TO MAKE A DECISION, AMY.

00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,350
ALL RIGHT, BARBARA.
YOU'RE IN. (laughs)
(Robert) ALL RIGHT.

00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,253
I THINK YOU MADE A MISTAKE.
(Daymond) YOU MADE
A BIG MISTAKE...

00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,555
(Barbara) YOU DID NOT.
HORRIBLE MISTAKE.

00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:11,891
(Allison)
I DON'T THINK WE DID.
LADIES, IT'S OVER BETWEEN US.

00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:14,360
<i>LET'S SEE</i>
<i>WHAT THEY'RE UP TO NOW.</i>
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.

00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,696
HERE WE ARE AT THE LARGEST
BABY PRODUCTS SHOW

00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,197
IN THE UNITED STATES.

00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:20,433
THIS IS
THE MOST AMAZING PRODUCT.

00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:24,270
IT'S ACTUALLY A SLIPCOVER
FOR PORTABLE PLAY YARDS.

00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,272
SINCE MAKING THE DEAL
WITH BARBARA,

00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,541
WE'VE HAD SO MANY DOORS OPEN.

00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,143
<i>SOON COVERPLAY WILL BE</i>
<i>AVAILABLE AT BABIES"R"US.</i>

00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:34,146
...SO GROSS INSIDE NOW.
(Allison)
MAJOR ONLINE RETAILERS

00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,115
COMPLETELY SOLD OUT
OF THE PRODUCT.

00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,051
WE HAVE MORE ORDERS THAN
WE COULD EVER POSSIBLY IMAGINE.

00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,053
OKAY, SO I WANT TO DO
PROBABLY 36 UNITS

00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:44,523
OF EACH OF THE PATTERNS
FOR EACH STORE.

00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,526
WE CONTACTED ONE OF THE LARGEST
HOTEL CHAINS IN THE NATION,

00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,729
AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESS
OF CLOSING A DEAL

00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:53,132
THAT WOULD PUT COVERPLAY IN
EVERY ONE OF THEIR PROPERTIES.

00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,636
WE'VE BEEN, LIKE,
BOMBARDED THE WHOLE DAY.

00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,639
YOU CAN'T JUST WALK INTO A BANK
AND GET A LOAN FOR $350,000,

00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,641
SO CLOSING THE DEAL
WITH BARBARA

00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:04,310
WAS THE BEST THING THAT
EVER HAPPENED FOR OUR COMPANY.

YOU AND I KNOW BOTH KNOW THIS.
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:21:57,616 --> 00:22:00,486
WHAT DID THEY SAY TO YOU?
WHAT'D THEY SAY TO YOU?

00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,655
I HAVE NOT BROUGHT IT
TO ANY MASS RETAILERS.

00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:05,591
I'VE BEEN FOCUSING ON
THE BOUTIQUES FOR TWO REASONS.

00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:07,760
NUMBER ONE, I HAVEN'T HAD
THE CAPITAL TO BE ABLE TO GROW

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,361
THE COMPANY AT THAT RATE,

00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:12,264
AND I DIDN'T WANT
TO PUT MY CART BEFORE MY HORSE.

00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,834
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE
WE HAD THE RIGHT PRODUCT,

00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:18,370
THE RIGHT MANUFACTURER.
BUT, LISA, WHY CAN'T YOU GO
TO A LARGE MASS RETAILER

00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:22,141
WITH THOSE THREE GUYS?
BECAUSE I'M UNDERCAPITALIZED.
I'VE GONE, I THINK,

00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:25,010
AS FAR AS I CAN WITHOUT
THE NEXT INFUSION OF CASH.

00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,446

1,100 PIECES LEFT,

00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:35,054
AND I GET ORDERS EVERY DAY.
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THOSE PIECES
ARE GONNA SELL THROUGH?

00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:37,056

I HAVE A STACK OF ORDERS

00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,091
SITTING ON MY DESK
FOR FOURTH QUARTER

00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:41,493
THAT I HAVEN'T EVEN PUT
IN THE SYSTEM YET.

00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:44,563
YOU KNOW, ENGRAINED IN MY MIND
LIKE A LASER ARE THESE NUMBERS.

00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:48,133
TOYS‐‐$30 BILLION.

00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:50,636

I KNOW THIS MARKET INSIDE OUT.

00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:53,672
I ALSO KNOW HOW BRUTAL IT IS
TO GET DISTRIBUTION.

00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:56,542
LISA, IF I INVESTED
IN A TOY BUSINESS AGAIN,

00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,878
I WOULD WAKE UP

00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,380
YOU'VE DONE A TERRIFIC JOB

00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,682
AND THERE'S NO QUESTION
IN MY MIND

00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:06,285
THAT THIS IS A GIANT
DISTRIBUTION JIGSAW PUZZLE.

00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:10,055

I WANT TO BE IN. I'M OUT.

00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:19,431

MM‐HMM.

00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:22,601
YOU KNOW, 3 TO WHAT?
14.

00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,503
14, OKAY.
MM‐HMM.

00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:26,639
SO THAT'S‐‐THAT'S WHAT
I CALL A NICHE PRODUCT.

00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:28,641
OTHER THAN THE OTHER NICHE,
WHICH IS SEASONAL,

00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:31,277
THIS IS A‐A CHRISTMASTIME‐TYPE
PRODUCT,

00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:34,146
SO THE AGE
AND THE SEASONALITY OF IT

00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,415
ARE TWO STRIKES AGAINST

IN CANADA.

00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:32,003
(O'Leary) OKAY.
WE'RE IN NORDSTROM RIGHT NOW.

00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:35,707
SO WHAT ARE YOUR SALES,
DANON, OVERALL?
IN 2008, THEY WERE $435,000.

00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:38,877
DID YOU MAKE ANY MONEY
ON $438,000?
WE'RE $50,000 NET PROFIT.

00:34:38,877 --> 00:34:40,378
WHAT'S THE PRICE POINT‐‐

00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:42,380
THE BELT
YOU'RE WEARING RIGHT NOW?

00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,449
THE RETAIL PRICE POINT'S
FROM $55 TO $99.

00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:45,951
THIS IS A $99 BELT.

00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:48,887
SO THE PRICES ARE GOOD
FOR THE QUALITY.

00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:51,590
YOU SELL THAT BELT FOR $100,
YOU HAVE ON?
YES.

00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,359
AND WHAT DID YOU PAY
TO MAKE THAT?
THIS BELT?
IT COST $40 WHOLESALE.

00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:57,729
HOW MANY BELTS HAVE YOU SOLD
IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS?

00:34:57,729 --> 00:35:00,799
UH, IT'S ABOUT 10‐‐
A LITTLE OVER 10,000.

00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:05,136
YOU SOLD 10,000 BELTS
IN THE LAST YEAR?
YES.

00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:08,373
DANON, DIDN'T SAY YOUR FAMILY
WAS INVOLVED IN THE BUSINESS?

00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:11,242
YOU'RE CORRECT.
I ACTUALLY COME FROM A FAMILY

00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:13,745
THAT'S GOT A HUGE BACKGROUND
IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY.

00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:16,348
MY FATHER, AL BERES,
DESIGNED BELTS FOR 35 YEARS.

00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:18,350
HE SOLD TO THE HIGH‐END STORES
AND CELEBRITIES‐‐

00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,385
EXPENSIVE, $1,000 BELTS.

00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:22,721
SO BASICALLY, WHAT I DID WHEN
LAUNCHING WASHED UP HOLLYWOOD,

00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:24,723
I WORKED UNDER HIS WING
FOR 15 YEARS,

00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:26,725
GOING TO THE TRADE SHOWS,
LEARNING THE BUSINESS.

00:35:26,725 --> 00:35:29,594
I WANTED TO MAKE A PRODUCT
THAT WAS AT A LOWER PRICE POINT

00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:32,597
THAT COULD BE SOLD
TO THE MASSES, BASICALLY.
WHO'S YOUR COMPETITION
RIGHT NOW?

00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:34,966
WE DON'T HAVE
A VERY STRONG COMPETITION

00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,769
FOR DIRECTLY WHAT WE DO.
NO ONE'S AT OUR PRICE POINT.

00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:40,138
NONE OF THEM REALLY HAVE
THE TYPE OF BUCKLE‐‐

00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:43,375
THE TYPE OF PRODUCT THAT WE
MAKE, A STAGE‐PRESENCE PRODUCT.
WHY‐‐WHY ARE YOU BETTER THEN?

00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:46,378
YOU GUYS SEE THE BELTS?
I MEAN, WHAT‐‐WHAT DO YOU SEE

00:35:46,378 --> 00:35:48,613
ABOUT ALL THE BELTS
THAT MAKES THEM DIFFERENT?

00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:50,749
WHAT'S THE FIRST THING
THAT CATCHES YOUR EYES?
THE DESIGN.

00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:53,752
(Barbara) THE BUCKLE.
(O'Leary) WHO'S YOUR DESIGNER?

00:35:53,752 --> 00:35:56,755
I'M THE DESIGNER.
YOU'RE THE DESIGNER,
AND YOU'RE THE C. E. O.?

00:35:56,755 --> 00:35:59,758
(O'Leary) THAT'S PRETTY RARE.
HOW MUCH DO YOU HAVE
INVESTED INTO THIS COMPANY?

00:35:59,758 --> 00:36:03,395
I HAVE OVER 120,000
OF MY OWN DOLLARS INVESTED IN.

00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:05,397
YOU'RE SAYING YOUR COMPANY
IS WORTH $2 MILLION,

00:36:05,397 --> 00:36:07,899
BECAUSE YOU'RE ASKING
FOR $500,000...

00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:09,968
CORRECT.
FOR 25%.

00:36:09,968 --> 00:36:11,970
WE HAVE OVER $150,000
IN ASSETS.

00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,572
OUR SALES
HAVE BEEN GROWING RAPIDLY.
I LIKE THE PRODUCT.

00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:16,708
I LIKE THE PRODUCT.
I LIKE THE REVENUE STREAM.

00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:18,710
I THINK HE'S GROWING.

00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:22,213
THE ONLY THING I DON'T LIKE IS,
I DON'T LIKE THE VALUE.
IT'S A $2‐MILLION VALUATION.

00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:25,050
YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING
YOU'VE CREATED

00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,085
THAT'S GONE
FROM ZERO TO $400,000.

00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:32,123
BUT THERE'S NO CHANCE
IT'S WORTH 2 MILLION BUCKS.

00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:34,392
I GIVE YOU THE $500,000,

00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:36,995
HOW DO I GET MY MONEY BACK?

00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:39,698
I THINK WE CAN BUILD OUR COMPANY
INTO A $32‐MILLION COMPANY

00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:42,067
IN FIVE YEARS.
I LOVE THE ARROGANCE.
I LOVE THE CONFIDENCE.

00:36:42,067 --> 00:36:44,969
APPAREL COMPANIES
ARE EXPLOSIVE.
I HATE YOUR VALUATION.

00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:48,039
THE GUY IS THE REAL DEAL.
HE'S GOT ORDERS. HE'S GOT‐‐
HE'S THE REAL DEAL
AND HE'S A PIG.

00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:51,676
WHAT DO YOU DO
WITH A GUY LIKE THIS?
I THINK
HE'S JUST PLAYING WITH US.

00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:55,914
ANY SECOND NOW,
HE'S GONNA SAY...

00:36:55,914 --> 00:36:57,916
"JUST KIDDING. JUST KIDDING."
"I WAS JUST JOKING A‐‐"

00:36:57,916 --> 00:37:00,018
"I'M REALLY WORTH..."
AND GIVE US
THE REAL VALUATION.

00:37:00,018 --> 00:37:02,320
"$650,000.
LET'S WORK TOGETHER."
IS THAT WHAT HE SAID?

00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,322
YOU THINK
WE'RE WORTH $650,000?
YEAH.

00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:07,292
I DON'T BELIEVE SO.
OUR SALES ARE ALREADY‐‐
YOU'RE WORTH‐‐

00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:10,762
OUR SALES ARE APPROACHING‐‐
YOU'RE WORTH ONE AND A HALF
TIMES SALES RIGHT NOW.

00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:13,665
LOOK, YOU'RE
A VERY INTERESTING CHARACTER‐‐

00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:15,500
A C. E. O./DESIGNER.

00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,802
NOW THERE'S A LITTLE BIT
OF A RISK THERE.

00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:20,805
IF YOU WALK OUT OF HERE
AND A BUS RUNS YOU OVER,

00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:23,641
YOU'RE GONNA BE SPARKLING
ON THE PAVEMENT WITH THAT BELT.

00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:25,977
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
I LOOK BOTH WAYS, ALWAYS.

00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:28,813
(Robert) LOOK, DANON,
HERE'S THE REALITY‐‐

00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:31,816
I THINK THE BUSINESS IS PROBABLY
WORTH $600,000 TO $700,000.

00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:34,519
IF YOU WANTED 25%,
I'D GIVE YOU $100,000, $200,000.

00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:37,522
BUT I CAN'T GIVE YOU $500,000,
'CAUSE I'D HAVE TO OWN YOU

00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:40,558
AND EVERY BELT BUCKLE
THAT YOU'VE EVER MADE.

AND ALL THE ONES YOU'RE GOING TO
MAKE FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS.

I DO LIKE THE PRODUCT,

00:38:16,895 --> 00:38:19,597

BUCKLES ARE HIDDEN UNDER

AND I JUST DON'T BELIEVE THAT
HE'S SOLD THAT MANY UNITS

00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:35,079

NO, I CAN BACK THAT UP.
OF COURSE.

IT DOESN'T EXTEND YOUR BRAND,

I THINK THE SHARKS
DEFINITELY LOST OUT TODAY.

00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:30,915
I THINK THEY MISSED IT TODAY.
THEY MISSED A BIG OPPORTUNITY.

00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:34,085
I LIKE THE GUY.
HE'S A PIG, THOUGH.

00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:37,355
THERE'S NO WAY THAT COMPANY
IS WORTH $2 MILLION.
NOT A CHANCE.

00:42:37,355 --> 00:42:40,358
ALL RIGHT. HE'S GONE.
HE'S DEAD. HE'S VAPOR.

00:42:40,358 --> 00:42:44,095
I'LL NEVER THINK OF HIM AGAIN,
EVEN WHEN I LOOK AT MY BELT.
BUT YOU HAVE A BELT BUCKLE.

00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:46,831
I KNOW, FROM A DEAD MAN.
(laughs)

00:42:46,831 --> 00:42:48,199
(chuckles)

00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:56,541
<i>NEXT WEEK ON "SHARK TANK"...</i>

00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:59,710
IS IT POSSIBLE
THAT LARGER‐SIZE WOMEN

00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,879
DON'T CARE ABOUT FASHION
AS MUCH?

00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:04,749
YOU ARE REALLY RUTHLESS.
YOU ARE REALLY RIGHT.

00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:07,785
I... DON'T KNOW THAT MUCH
ABOUT THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY.
OOH.

00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:10,688
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD'VE JUST SAID TO ME.

00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:13,191
ARE YOU CUTTING HIM A CHECK?
I AM GONNA WRITE YOU A CHECK.

00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:15,893
(O'Leary) NO!
ARE YOU CRAZY?
GIVE ME THE MONEY.

00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:18,796
YOU MUST BE OUT OF YOUR MIND.
DON'T DO IT.
DON'T DO IT.

00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:21,099
I'LL GIVE YOU $20,000
FOR THERAPY.

00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:23,568
(laughs)
OH, MY. MY, MY, MY.
