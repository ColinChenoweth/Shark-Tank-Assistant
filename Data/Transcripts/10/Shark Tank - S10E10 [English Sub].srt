We are today seeking $300,000

To put it simply,

00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,502
Uniform is an ethical

at Bloomingdales,

Okay. So, we did $400,000
on Kickstarter.

00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:03,396
Then last year,
we only did $300,000,

00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:05,064
but it's because we
launched at Bloomingdales

00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,699
for back‐to‐school,
and then online,

00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:09,635
our website launched in,
uh, November.

00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,604

those were online, and what ‐‐

Probably about 70% retail,
30% online.

00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:21,380
So, what's your history, uh,
you know, before this?

00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,850
Were you already
in the textile or fashion?

00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:27,753
Yeah. We started a company in
2010 called Liberty &amp; Justice,

00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:30,690
that was only a manufacturing
company in Africa.

00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,924

00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:45,004
We established the first
fair‐trade certified factory

00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,405
on the continent.

00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:49,742
We ended up getting about
$40 million in annual orders.

‐Wow.
‐It was a pretty amazing time

...as you can imagine.

00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:57,016
Um, and then in 2014,
this little thing called

00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,684
the Ebola Outbreak
happened...

00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,353
‐Ooh.
‐...and completely shut down

00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,721
our company.
Wow.

00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:04,924
We went from figuring out how
quickly we could grow

00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:08,127
to how to save all
of our workers' lives.

00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:10,630
You couldn't go to work.
You couldn't go to school.

00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,298
So, we're getting
ready to ship,

00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:14,734
and the entire town
turns into a ghost town.

00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:17,303
And so what happened after
it was all cleared up?

00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:19,839
So, nine months later,
we go back on the ground.

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,641
Nine months?
It took nine months

00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:23,976
to get no new cases
of Ebola in Liberia.

00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,345
Um, all of our customers
are long‐gone.

00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:29,382
They kind of were like,
"Hey, we gave you guys a shot.

00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,684
We spent two years building
this thing with you,

00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:33,319
and nothing happened."

00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,955
So we essentially went
back to the factory,

00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:37,323
met with the workers.

00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:41,027
We had th‐‐ hundreds of
thousands of dollars of fabric

00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:43,629
that was just sitting in
a warehouse for nine months.

00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,097
And we were trying to figure out
what we could do

00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,667
with this fabric, and it finally
dawned on somebody

00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,368
that we should make
school uniforms.

00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,604
MIT did research and proved
that if you give

00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:53,139
a child a school uniform,

00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:55,408
their attendance
goes up by up to 62%.

00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,877
And for every three young girls
you give a uniform to,

00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:59,412
two will delay
their first pregnancy.

00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,247
That's major.
And so I just thought,

00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,082
"My goodness, what if
we could give,

00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,017
uh, these
uniforms away?"

00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,153
And I thought, "Huh,
I have seen this model

00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:10,923
before where you sell something
and you give something away.

00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,259
What if we launched
a T‐shirt company

00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,962
that turned into a full‐clothing
company to pay for it?"

00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:18,564
And that's how
Uniform was born.

00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,533
What are you
looking for from us?

00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:23,102
So, we really are looking
for partners in the business

00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,971
that help us take it
to the next level.

00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:29,475
Next year, we're scheduling
to launch at Target, actually.

00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,043
It's a huge deal.
So going from 13 stores

00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,778
to 1,300 stores,
potentially.

00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,080
‐That's committed?
‐It's committed.

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,481
Just with kids.
We don't have

00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,083
the purchase orders yet,
but we've having meetings.

00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,618

we can do for you besides money?

00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,563

00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:04,377

things that we can do

in terms
of capsule collections.

00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:07,947
And, Robert, we've seen what
you've done with other

00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:10,449
apparel brands,
um, on the Tank.

00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,284
So, along that line,
I appreciate that.

00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:13,786
‐Dude, you're a great sales guy.
‐Thank you.

00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:15,921
I mean, you're just
bam, bam, bam.

00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,156
Okay, let me
tell you a story.

00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,492
So, nine years ago,
somebody came on the show

00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:20,826
and they had a T‐shirt.

00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,395
It was a simple T‐shirt,
and I was like,

00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:23,829
"I love it,
I'm gonna invest in it."

00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,464
Daymond was at
the other end going,

00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:27,299
"He doesn't know
what he's doing."

00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,769
‐Oh, my God.
‐And we got into it.

00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:31,437
We thought we were gonna
sell everything,

00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:35,007
and then it was like
inventory and this,

00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:38,544
and we have to buy now
for a season eight months later.

00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:39,812
‐Sure.
‐Blew my mind.

00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:41,647
‐Yes.
‐Great presentation.

00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,749
Bootie, thanks for being...
Thanks.

00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,451
...whatever it is you do.

00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:47,553
Yeah. I'm out.
Thank you, Robert.

00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,989
Greiner: So, Mark and I
invested in a company

00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:51,957
a few years ago called Umano.

00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,292
They also were in Bloomingdales,

00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:55,528
there also was
a lot of T‐shirts.

00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,596
Um, we thought they were cool.
They looked nice.

00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,231
The fabric was good
and all of that.

00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:03,235
But before we could even close
the deal, they went bankrupt.

00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:05,137
And Mark and I
looked at each other

00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,872
and we were like,
"Wow," you know?

00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,107
‐That was fast.
‐Yeah.

00:20:08,107 --> 00:20:10,176
And what it taught me is
that the clothing business

00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:11,210
is really competitive.

00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,545
It's really tough.

00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,914
‐Yeah.
‐So I ‐‐

00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:17,283
I don't think it's
the right investment for me.

00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:19,785
So I wish you luck, but I'm out.

00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:22,288

creating a new machine.

We would buy something and sell
it under our Pristine label.

00:34:23,295 --> 00:34:25,030
I think right now,
they're sort of waiting to see,

00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,598
'cause we've just
started delivering.

00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:29,301
Herjavec: And why is it
worth $3 million?

00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:31,803
You're asking $200,000
for 7.5%.

00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:33,471
Yeah.
That's a great question.

00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:35,206
Um, I mean, up to this point,
200k in sales...

00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:36,841
Well, it depends
on the answer.

00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:38,176
...200k in sales
in eight months.

00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:40,478
That has been with
no advertising at all

00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:43,114
and with only one
modestly‐sized retailer.

00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:44,950
Next year, we're gonna
dump money into advertising.

00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,718
We're gonna blow up
our Facebook sales.

00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:48,153
We're gonna expand,
hopefully pick up

00:34:48,153 --> 00:34:49,454
another two
or three retail partners.

00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:50,555
John: Why do you have it ‐‐

00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:53,391
But, why are you giving us
the valuation of

00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:55,860
"hopefully, if everything
goes perfect"?

00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,262
Uh, you may get to a point
when you manufacture

00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:58,697
and get knocked off.

00:34:58,697 --> 00:35:01,099
Your ‐‐ you know, your prices
may be compressioned...

00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,068
‐Ah, yes.
‐...or ‐‐ and/or diverted.

00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:04,536
You mentioned about
it getting knocked off.

00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:07,038
We have filed a utility patent.
It's currently under review.

00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:08,406
And we've filed a P. C. T.

00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:10,208
Lentz: I'd like to say
a couple more things.

00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,477
I think somebody could see the
brand, they can see the product,

00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:13,912
and they can see
the potential to create

00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:15,614
a whole ecosystem
of items, right?

00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:18,049
Well, okay.
So, expand on the ecosystem.
Yeah.

00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:20,151
Well, we have great ‐‐
uh, a lot of great ideas

00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:21,286
on how to do it,
but you incorporate

00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:23,288
soap dispensation
into the product.

00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:25,090
Then also, there's smaller,
low‐hanging fruit

00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:27,525
like strainers,
tethers, towels.

00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:30,829
I have a question. I've seen
things out there that...

00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:31,930
‐You have?
‐Combs, yeah.

00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:33,932
...that are scrubbers
with, you know,

00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:36,334
water that comes through,
brushes with water.

00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:38,570
Okay. So, it ‐‐ they're a lot
of different people

00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,605
in this category,
but there's no mechanism

00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:42,474
where you can actually turn it
on and off with one hand.

00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:44,342
I think that's the big...
That is cool.

00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:45,677
...the big point
that separates us,

00:35:45,677 --> 00:35:47,445
is because you never
have to reach for anything.

00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:50,348
So, no one else came out with
an on‐off toggle on the hand?

00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:53,518
No. No. There's nothing
like this out there.

00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:54,819
You know, it's a great lesson.

00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,721
Sometimes, the simplest remixes.
I always say that, yeah.

00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:58,790
How will you get
that message across

00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:01,159
in the three seconds somebody
has to look at this?

00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,061
Frankel: I got it, though.
I usually never get it.

00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:04,629
When I sat here,
I got the whole thing.

00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:06,431
There's a button in the middle.
And to me, it makes some sense.

00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:07,866
Cuban: And they've got
the hand right there.

00:36:07,866 --> 00:36:09,834
And you need more dog
on that packaging.

00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,170
Lentz: Absolutely.

00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,772
All right, guys.
Let me start.

00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:16,474
I ‐‐ I have a lot of investment
in the pet industry.

00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:18,543
We've learned a lot
in the last few years.

00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:22,814
Love dogs, but I cannot
get to the $3 million.

00:36:22,814 --> 00:36:25,817
I'll give you
the $200,000 for 25%.

00:36:25,817 --> 00:36:29,688
That's the level that I see
in terms of the risk

00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:32,757
in order to get to market and
the work that it's gonna take.

00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:35,126
That's the offer from me.

00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:36,361
Thanks, Robert.
I really appreciate it.

00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:37,595
‐Thank you.
‐We're gonna consider it.

00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:41,166
Okay. So, I feel like this
is a very crowded space.

00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:44,269
I kind of like when things are
a little bit more unique.

00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:47,138
And so for that reason,
I'm out.

00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:48,807
‐Oh, that's unfortunate.
‐Sorry to hear that, Lori.

00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:51,076
‐Sorry.
‐Guys, I'll be brutally candid.

00:36:51,076 --> 00:36:54,245
I hate the pet‐accessory
business.

00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:55,346
There's always an idea.

00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:56,915
There's always
somebody else to do it.

00:36:56,915 --> 00:36:58,717
I think what you've done
is phenomenal,

00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,118
but somebody's gonna come up
with something

00:37:00,118 --> 00:37:02,187
a little bit better,
somehow, someway.

00:37:02,187 --> 00:37:04,689
That's just the nature
of the pet‐accessory business.

00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:07,225
So for those reasons, I'm out.

00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,760
‐Thanks, Mark.
‐Thanks, Mark.

00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,095
Greiner: You haven't heard
from Daymond, who...

00:37:10,095 --> 00:37:11,830
Yeah. We've love to hear
your feedback, Daymond.

00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,765
...actually is Mr. Petco.
[ Laughs ]

00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:15,033
John: Yeah, I'm on the ‐‐
I'm on the board

00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:16,167
for the Petco foundation.

00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:17,635
And Mark brings up
a good point, you know.

00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:20,305
The pet industry is really
a challenging industry

00:37:20,305 --> 00:37:21,406
for a couple of reasons.

00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:22,574
People are habitual.

00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:23,808
They'll spend anything
on their pet.

00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:25,376
But, you know, it's getting
them educated

00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:28,546
that something like this exists
is extremely, extremely hard.

00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:30,348
So to value your company
at that much is ‐‐

00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:33,017
it's challenging for me to ‐‐
for me to go help you.

00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:34,285
I don't want to insult you,

00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:36,187
but I know the amount
of work this is gonna be.

00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:40,692
I will give you
the $200,000 for 30%.

00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:42,961
Ooh! You're going
the wrong way.

00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:43,928
‐Well, no.
‐You're not shy.

00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,163
‐I'm up.
‐Okay.

00:37:45,163 --> 00:37:48,299
Uh, okay. I have two dogs,
Biggie and Smalls...

00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:49,400
‐Aw.
‐...that are from

00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,336
the same litter,
but they're 10 pounds apart.

00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:52,771
So I'm a very big dog person.

00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,739
That was a great story.
And I ‐‐ Thank you, good.

00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:56,074
Is there an offer
coming or anything?

00:37:56,074 --> 00:37:57,308
So I've been ‐‐ No.
Oh, I'm glad you're ‐‐

00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:58,276
I'm here to entertain you.

00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,711
‐Moving on.
‐Listen.

00:37:59,711 --> 00:38:00,678
Oh, move on?

00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:02,580
I listen to you drone on
for hours.

00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,349
‐Right.
‐So it's my turn, sunshine.

00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:05,717
‐Talk to the hand.
‐Hi.

00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:07,185
When you're about to go
offer them a little money,

00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:09,287
you can take a little longer.

00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:14,025
$200,000 for 30%, but I will
be involved, you know,

00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:16,427
with my face in ‐‐
in the advertising.

00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:18,696
And it would be contingent
that Biggie and Smalls

00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:20,365
have to be on
the package themselves.

00:38:20,365 --> 00:38:23,067
I think we could
accommodate that. Okay.

00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:24,569
So, three offers,
that's awesome.

00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:26,938
Now that the other
offers are at 30%,

00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:29,340
I'm gonna go the other way, too.

00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,742
Just to make it even.

00:38:30,742 --> 00:38:31,976
You didn't
take my offer right away.

00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,711
‐It's all the same offer.
‐I'll do the $200,000

00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:35,113
at 30%, also.
‐Ooh!

00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:39,317
So, guys, you have three
offers that are identical.

00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,920
You can counter.
You can say yes or no.

00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,721
What would you like to do?

00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:46,991
Hmm.

00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,466
Narrator: Two Sharks are out.

00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:57,969
Tom and Daniel have the same
offer from Robert,

00:38:57,969 --> 00:38:59,337
Bethenny, and Daymond ‐‐

00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:03,641
$200,000 for 30%
of their business, Aquapaw.

00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:06,845
Um, I will say the equity
asked is a little high.

00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,479
Daymond mentioned all
of his Petco experience.

00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:10,815
Uh, Bethenny, Robert,
do you guys have any sort of,

00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:12,116
uh, connections
with retailers

00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:15,220
that you can expedite
this process for us?

00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,288
‐Oh.
‐Actually, hang on a sec, Tom.

00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:18,756
I'm gonna go get my résumé,

00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:20,592
and maybe you can have
a look at it!

00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:22,994
Frankel: You could've done
research ahead of time.
What are you talking about?

00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:24,262
‐You probably want that. ‐Yeah.

00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:25,396
I mean, I'm in Kroger, Amazon...

00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:27,532
‐Come on.
‐...on Jet, we're all, you know.

00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:29,434
Nine seasons, we've sold
a lot of pet stuff.

00:39:29,434 --> 00:39:30,635
All right, here's what
I have to say,

00:39:30,635 --> 00:39:32,203
and maybe this can help you.

00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,672
I do have a lot of connections
and experience there.

00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:37,508
But to be very honest,
I wouldn't be a spokesperson.

00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:39,010
I'd be the back office.

00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:42,113
I'd be the one who talks to the
buyers and help you get there.

00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:45,083
But if you believe
that you have an offer

00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:48,653
by somebody here
who will save you thousands

00:39:48,653 --> 00:39:50,555
or maybe millions
of dollars‐worth

00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,023
of advertising and exposure,

00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:54,359
and that's what you need,
I'm not gonna be selfish

00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:56,861
and tell you that
I'm gonna do that.

00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:58,897
I run a pretty big
cybersecurity business.

00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:00,498
I have a full‐time job.

00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:01,733
We're here ‐‐
Oh, now all of a sudden,

00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:03,067
I'm some schlepper?
We're here to help you.

00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,469
Oh, I ‐‐ I ‐‐
No, no, no.

00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:07,205
If Bethenny has the time to go
on sales calls with you ‐‐

00:40:07,205 --> 00:40:08,740
No, I'm not going
on sales calls!

00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,708
I'm gonna be the girl washing
the dog in that ‐‐ in that...

00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:11,976
She'll take some pictures.

00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:13,411
I'm not going on
sales calls.

00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,446
She wants you to use
her face and image...

00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:17,315
‐Yeah.
‐...on it, which ‐‐

00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:19,651
Which is worth a lot of
money, that I will say.

00:40:19,651 --> 00:40:21,152
So, guys, we believe
that all of you

00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:22,987
offer value
of different sorts.

00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:26,090
Um, we'd like to counter
to see if maybe,

00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,892
Bethenny, with your connections
on social media,

00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:29,294
and Daymond, with your
back‐office

00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:31,930
and Petco experience,
you guys consider joining up.

00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:36,234
$200,000 for 20%, so $100,000
for 10% and $100,000 for 10%.

00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:38,503
Whoa, dude.
If you're getting th‐‐

00:40:38,503 --> 00:40:40,071
If you're getting both of us...
Wow!

00:40:40,071 --> 00:40:41,406
...I can't even speak
for Daymond yet,

00:40:41,406 --> 00:40:43,775
but if you're getting
both of us, definitely the 30%
