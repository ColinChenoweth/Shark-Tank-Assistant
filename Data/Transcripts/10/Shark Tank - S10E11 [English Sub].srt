00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,731
and I used to buy extra
men's razors for Iskra

00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:26,666
because they were
so much cheaper,

00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,301
but, because they were
almost identical,

00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:29,769
she would grab mine
by mistake.

00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:30,970
I had an epiphany.

00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,374
And, just like
any brilliant idea,

00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:40,313
the concept of our company
was born in the shower.

Angel Shave Club ‐‐
a shave club for women.

00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,820
We're fighting the pink tax
one shave at a time,

00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,423
making it so every woman
can be her own guardian angel.

00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:53,359

to love our razors

00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:54,727

We have samples
for everyone.

00:14:56,796 --> 00:15:01,167
Now, what we have here is
our flagship product,

00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:04,704
our box that our customers get
when they first order.

00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:06,172
We send out
subscription razors

00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:08,408
bimonthly
and every four months,

00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,610
depending on the frequency
that they choose

00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,078
when they first sign up.

00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:15,181
They can choose a quantity
of six razors or eight.

00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:16,382
So, answer me this.

00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:19,018
I look at this,
and, other than the pink handle,

00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,087
it's the same thing.

00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:25,658
Why not just use
a man's shaver?

00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:26,826
Because we like pink,

00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:28,995
and we want our razors

00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:31,364
to reflect the personalities
of our customers.

00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:32,698
I had a razor like his,

00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,400
and I couldn't tell them
apart.

00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,935
Put a little pink sticker
on one,

00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,103
no sticker on the other.
And not only that...

00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,604
Would you say the cost
is the same, though?

00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,039
The cost is exactly
the same.

00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,340
Like, if it's yours,
but it's pretty pink,

00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,809
and it just feels
more feminine.

00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:45,344
Exactly.
But apples to apples,
it's equal?

00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:48,448
Actually, our razors
are really, really good.

00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,117
I don't know, ladies,
if you shave at night,

00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,186
the next day you're already
kind of stubbly.

00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:55,321
With our razors,
actually,

00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:58,658
you're just
as if you just shaved.

00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:01,461
What would keep the people,
the big players in this space,

00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,362
from just coming out
with a pink razor?

00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:06,199
Nothing,

00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:08,000
and we welcome
all competition,

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,269
however, they are still

00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,672
man‐owned
and man‐run companies.

00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:15,208
We are the first shave club
that's started by women

00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,409
with women in mind.

00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:17,777
Do you have
any customers now?

00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:19,045
We've been a business
for two years.

00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:20,947
We have close
to 9,000 customers.

00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:22,515
Those 9,000 have been,
on average,

00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:23,616
how long with you?

00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:25,952
Four to six
billing cycles.

00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:27,086
What's your turn?
How many have fallen off,

00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,387
stopped using you?
For a long time?

00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,156
We have
a turn rate of ‐‐

00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:33,459
it's 10% to 12% monthly.
Tsenkova: Every month.

00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:34,994
And the number‐one reason
is because

00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,629
people have
too many blades,

00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:38,164
and they eventually quit,

00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,866
but we're actually
rebuilding the site

00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:41,701
to include
a better pause feature.

00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:43,503
So, wait. How many blades
do you get in a month?

00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,204
We send a box
of six or eight.

00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:46,873
And it's expected
to last how long?

00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:48,508
I'm just curious.
That's two months...

00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,209
This is two months.
...or four months,
depending on the woman.

00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,078
Did you ever tell us
what it costs?

00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:55,314
It's $18 either every two months
or every four months.

00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:57,450
There's another issue,
is there not?

00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:02,355
The stubble on a man's chin
is extremely tough on steel.

00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:03,923
It dulls it very quickly.

00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:05,791
Not so
with women's leg hair.

00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,893
You haven't met
my legs.

But they get three times
more usage

00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,564
out of one blade.

00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:12,565
Is that true?

00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:14,734
We might not shave
as often,

00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:18,104
however, we have a larger
square‐footage to cover,

00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:20,840
so, ideally, a woman would have
to change her blade ‐‐

00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,842
Yeah, but you've been
doing this a while now.

00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:25,912
You literally turn over
your entire subscription base

00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:27,680
every eight
to ten months.

00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,149
There's either too many blades,
or something else is wrong.

00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:33,419
What does it cost you
to make it?

00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,854
So, the flagship box

00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:36,789
where you get razors
and a handle,

00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,691
and then the repeats
plus the shipping,

00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:40,026
it's gonna be $10.

00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:41,561
That's not a lot
of gross dollars,

00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:42,895
and it's expensive.

00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,931
But that being said,
our first nine months,

00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:47,433
we did $74,000 in sales.

00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:51,337
Last year, we closed
at just over $390,000.

00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:53,306
This year ‐‐
So, you've built, like,

00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:54,774
a very nice business
for yourself.
Yeah.

00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:56,142
O'Leary: But you're not making
any money.

00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:57,376
You're not making any money,
are you?

00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,946
We're reinvesting absolutely
everything that comes in.

00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:01,647
We would actually be able
to fund for the whole year,

00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,516
but the problem is
our supply chain

00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:05,851
currently right now
is 90‐day lead times.

00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,887
That's the reason
why we can't take profits,

00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:10,656
because we have to put every
single dollar we have into...

00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:11,791
And then some.

00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,259
Guys, the challenge,
as you know,

00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,762
is, in terms of cash,
it takes a lot of cash,

00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,999
because, at 10 bucks a month,
9,000 subscribers,

00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:22,134
$90,000 a month,

00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,537
you're gonna have
to spend 10x of that

00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:27,440
just to acquire enough customers
to really be successful.

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,408
Actually,
our customer acquisition cost

00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:31,010
is not that high.

00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,446
It's not so much
the customer‐acquisition cost.

00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,214
It's that
you turn so much.

00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:36,616
We are putting practices
in place

00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,317
to actually reduce
that turn rate,

00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,585
because we think that

00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:41,988
by putting
a pause feature in,

00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:44,256
maybe we'll even
allow women to,

00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:45,625
instead of two months
or four months,

00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,093
we'll even do
a six‐month option.

00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:48,894
Okay, why are you worth
$3 million?

00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:52,064
We're on track to do about
$700,000 this year in sales.

00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,767
We're already at $220,000
as of today.

00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:56,869
So we're actually almost double
what we did last year.

00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:59,538
Even if you hit
the $700k‐mark,

00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,674
which would be great
in just the top‐line growth,

00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:03,142
you still won't be
making any money.

00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,410
But this is
the type of business

00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,978
you can do
ridiculous numbers.

00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,447
It's not like
we're gonna sell 1,000 units

00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,082
and make a huge profit.

00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,318
We're gonna sell 100,000 units
and make a profit.

00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,453

subscription boxes,

00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:15,554
to receive them.

a bit of a surprise inside.

Well, no, I get
that you've got to shave,

to be something different,

of these clubs

they'll lose their shape at all.

I was 22 when I had
my first child,

I was going through
a difficult time in my life,

of making a dress

I would pretty much
