you're basically saying

the idea is to start your baby

Which one of you
is the astronaut?

00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:55,307
Taylor. So, Taylor's got
the SpaceX background.

00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,008
‐Taylor, I have a question.
‐Oh, seriously?

00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,543
Taylor,
you work at SpaceX?

00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:00,812
So, my background was
in product development

00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,647
at a large consumer goods
company.

00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:03,548
Which one?

00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:04,850
‐At Clorox.
‐Clorox, okay.

00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,785
So, I did product development
for Brita water filters.

00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:09,187
I actually earned five patents
for inventions there.

00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:10,522
You did.
I did.

00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:13,558
Wow.
And so, then moved down
to work in Aerospace

00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:15,927
on air filtration
for an environmental control

00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:17,562
and life‐support system.

00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:20,165
At SpaceX.
Yeah, at SpaceX.

00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,734
Sierra, what do you do?
I do scaling and growth.

00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:26,071
So, my background is primarily
in strategy and operations.

00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:28,673
I worked
for a large hospital network.

00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:31,243
I was the youngest director ‐‐
male or female ‐‐

00:33:31,243 --> 00:33:32,844
at the company,
and then went on to become

00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,212
chief of staff
to the CEO.

00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:36,314
And how did you meet?
At Harvard Business School.

00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:39,484
It says "Approved by NASA"
or "Invented by NASA."

00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:42,153
Yeah, so, the technology
was tested by NASA

00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:45,257
to clean the air aboard
the International Space Station.

00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:47,158
The product is not endorsed
by NASA, though.

00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:48,326
What's in this?

00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:49,761
So, it's
an activated carbon cloth.

00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:53,565
There's lots of activated carbon
cloth technologies out there.

00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:55,467
‐Yeah.
‐So why is yours different?

00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:58,303
So, we actually tested
our product and our material

00:33:58,303 --> 00:34:00,105
against all of
the leading competitors,

00:34:00,105 --> 00:34:01,907
and we found
that our technology

00:34:01,907 --> 00:34:04,142
absorbs up to eight times
as much shoe odor

00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:05,477
as the next
leading competitor.

00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:07,746
How long does it last
before it has to be replaced?

00:34:07,746 --> 00:34:09,414
It lasts for approximately
two months

00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:10,949
or we say
up to 60 wears.

00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:14,052
Taylor, you said that
this has more odor prevention

00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,554
than a full tennis court?

00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:16,988
Yep.
So, it looks small,

00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:19,124
but it's actually filled
with a ton of little micropores,

00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:20,959
which are a magnet for odor,

00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:22,694
and so if you took
all of those micropores

00:34:22,694 --> 00:34:24,863
and laid them out, it would
cover a full tennis court.

00:34:24,863 --> 00:34:25,830
Okay, there we go.
So it's a density issue.

00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:26,865
Exactly.

00:34:26,865 --> 00:34:28,466
So, the fun fact
about our product

00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:30,602
is that 40% of people
that use it

00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:32,237
have never used
a shoe‐odor‐eliminating

00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:33,338
solution before.

00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:34,773
Yeah,
but how did they find you?

00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:35,974
Yeah, so, right now,
we're doing ‐‐

00:34:35,974 --> 00:34:37,742
we do direct‐to‐consumer
marketing.

00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,010
So we sell them
through our website,

00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,079
and then we're launching
on Amazon, Walmart, and Jet.

00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,314
Herjavec: Got it.
How much do you charge for them?

00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:43,582
How many have you sold?

00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:45,116
They're $5 per pair.

00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:46,751
What does it cost you
to make them?

00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,787
Currently,
it costs us $1.65.

00:34:48,787 --> 00:34:50,455
Wow.
At scale,
it'll be 80 cents.

00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:52,791
‐Oh, you're making ‐‐
‐And is that in the U. S. A.

00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:53,959
or is that...
‐80 cents at scale?

00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:55,627
It's all made in the U. S. A.
in New Jersey.

00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:56,962
So what are
your total sales?

00:34:56,962 --> 00:34:58,630
We've sold $103,000
to date.

00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,798
Over what time?

00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:01,533
Since we launched
in July of 2017.

00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:03,068
‐All right.
‐What size shoe do you wear?

00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:04,169
9.5 ‐‐
I have smaller feet.

00:35:04,169 --> 00:35:06,538
All right, you wear a 9.5.
I wear a 17.

00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:08,173
‐Whoa!
‐Almost double my size.

00:35:08,173 --> 00:35:09,074
‐How is that ‐‐
‐17?!

00:35:09,074 --> 00:35:11,042
That is
truly miraculous.

00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,277
Oh, my God.

00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:14,512
How is ‐‐
We can use one pad a piece?

00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:15,580
Yes.
He needs seven.

00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,882
Yes.
No. He's gonna need more,
right?

00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:19,651
You know, to be honest,
we haven't tested them

00:35:19,651 --> 00:35:21,653
on a size 17 foot before,
so we should do that.

00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:23,622
And you'd probably need to
with his. It's like...

00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:24,856
Do you have a patent?

00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:27,692
So, we have a provisional patent
on the product itself.

00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:30,128
Third‐party tes‐‐
Do you buy your material
from someone else...

00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,396
We do.
...or did you create it?

00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:32,564
We buy it
from somebody else.

00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:33,898
So it's already
out there...

00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:35,767
Oh, so you didn't
create this.
...and someone else ‐‐

00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:37,002
We don't manufacture
the material, no,

00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:38,637
but the patent is
on the construction

00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,639
of the fabric
and the actual product.
Smith: Yes.

00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,974
Right, and what do you need
the money for today?

00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,844
So, two main things ‐‐
marketing and sales.

00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:48,013
So, obviously right now,
we are building a brand,

00:35:48,013 --> 00:35:49,514
so we want
to invest more there.

00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:53,852
Why did you choose spending
your $150,000 on branding?

00:35:53,852 --> 00:35:55,153
Why make that choice?

00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,055
The growth of this business
we do truly believe

00:35:57,055 --> 00:35:58,490
will be through retail,

00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,025
and so we think
by getting into retail,

00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:01,693
you naturally are getting
all of the eyeballs

00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:02,761
of anyone going
into that market ‐‐

00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:03,962

But you only raised $100‐‐

00:36:03,962 --> 00:36:06,331
You're only asking here
$150,000, right?

00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:08,166
Yes.
That's not a lot

00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,602
relative to building
even a local brand.

00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:12,470
We have an incredible pitch
for retailers, right?

00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,571
We're saying...
What's the pitch?

00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:15,206
...we can bring 40%
new customers

00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:16,341

Oh!

00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:17,876

Absolutely.

‐Oh.
‐That's a little brutal.

Nobody has foot traffic
to their odor products

in traditional retail
and big‐box retail,

00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:32,223
so where are you gonna spend
your money

00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:34,325
to create a brand
and drive traffic

00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,594

and nobody goes?

00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:37,962

I've made a lot of people
millionaires.

But I also have to know
that something works,

00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:01,586
so I'm gonna do this
contingent

'cause I care about
my customers.
Oh, a contingency.

00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:04,956
So, here's gonna be
the contingency.

to work with you.

Ha, oh!

00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,126
Giving up 30% is crazy
at this point.
Herjavec: Crazy!

00:37:41,126 --> 00:37:42,594
No, it's not,

00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:25,363
You know what they say about men
with little feet.

00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,031
These guys got
little feet.

00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,399
[ Laughter ]

00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:30,568
I ‐‐ I wouldn't do a deal
with these two little feet men.

00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:32,003
Wow.

00:39:32,003 --> 00:39:33,338
I trust her.

00:39:33,338 --> 00:39:37,508
This is her field,
and I'm riding it with her.

00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:38,910
Cuban: Ride or die.

00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,345
Ride or die.

00:39:40,345 --> 00:39:41,913
Greiner:
So, here's a question.

00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:43,581
Do you want
the cheapest deal,

00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:46,284
or do you want the most
successful‐outcome deal?

00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:47,785
I wouldn't give up
that much equity.

00:39:49,654 --> 00:39:52,457
Smith: So, first of all,
thank you all for the offers.

00:39:52,457 --> 00:39:57,495
Um, Lori and Charles, would you
beat the other two offers?

00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:59,464
Beat them?

00:39:59,464 --> 00:40:02,200
So you're saying
you want Charles and I

00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:07,071
to give you $150,000
for 20%?

00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,873

‐Less than 20%?
‐Less than 20%?

00:40:13,478 --> 00:40:15,246
I'll do it for 15%.

So do I.

00:40:26,324 --> 00:40:29,160
So, we are not
apples to apples here.

00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,195

you're not Mr. Wonderful.

In fairness to me, also,

I'm giving you
a free commercial.

00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:38,536
I'm gonna go on television,
advertise your product,

00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:41,806
and I'm a lot more expensive
than $150,000, in fairness.

00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:44,008
Herjavec: And I think you're not
gonna give up that equity.

00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:45,677
I think you're too smart
to fall in for this.

00:40:45,677 --> 00:40:48,079
I'll tell you what.
I'll give you the $150,000

00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,716
for 12%.

00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:53,351
Could you match
their 20%?

00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:55,486
The original 20%?

So, is that yes?

If you take the 20%,
we would take it...
Guys.

00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:08,900
...and that's, like,
coming in at a 12% and a 15%.

‐We definitely see ‐‐

Sierra, you didn't start
this company

that much equity.

That's crazy.
