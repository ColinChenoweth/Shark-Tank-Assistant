consumer packaged goods.

00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,540
That means that your margins
are going to be less

00:26:58,517 --> 00:27:00,185
I saw at a tailgate next to us,

00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:02,488
somebody took a cold beer
from a cooler

00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:03,522
and put it in a can insulator.

00:27:03,522 --> 00:27:04,923
That's when it hit me.

00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:07,993
Why don't we have the same thing
for the entire case of beer?

00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:09,495
How long does it stay cold?

00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:10,696
Seven hours.

00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:12,698

sell this for,

and what's it cost you?

00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:19,471
We sell at retail,
the 12‐pack, for $29.95,

00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,207
the 24‐ and 30‐pack for $34.95,

00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:25,344
and our custom channels average
about $20 per unit.

00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:30,048
Now, our cost of goods average
$6.10, and $3.50

00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:32,084
is how much it costs us
right now to land it.

Okay, $9.60 total.

on the product that
keeps it cold,

or is it like every other
thermos lining?

00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,192
What's really exciting,
actually,

00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:42,394
about this entire package
is, intuitively,

00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:45,831
the actual cardboard case adds
some level of insulation.

that cardboard casing then a s‐‐

and, uh, prevents any air
from getting in and out.

00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,008
And then the foam layer

00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,910

of an air gap to it.

00:34:04,276 --> 00:34:06,411
of tickets to stuff,
and you kept how much?

00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:08,680
Our net income from
that number this year

00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,148
projected to be
about $700,000.

00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:11,650
‐Nice.
‐Wow.

00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,919
No ki‐‐ I thought this
was poo‐poo on a stick.

00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:15,320
Hold on, how about this?

00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,889
Since we launched in 2010,

00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:22,694
we have generated more
than $30 million in sales.

00:34:22,694 --> 00:34:24,162
‐Wow.
‐Wow.

00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:27,198
Have you cut any deals with
the toy companies for products?

00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:28,733
So, that's the other side
of the business

00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,368
is that,
in the last three years,

00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:32,137
we added a new element
of the business

00:34:32,137 --> 00:34:33,672
where we were doing
paid advertising.

00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:37,309
So that's opened up this
enormous revenue model for us.

00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:39,911
How often do you send
your newsletter out?
Every day.

00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,280
We have over a million
subscribers.

00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,783
Wow.
I would say about
half of those

00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:47,118
are, you know,
super engaged.

00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:49,054
What's your open for
a typical daily open?

00:34:49,054 --> 00:34:51,990
It's a 10% open,
14% click‐through.

00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:53,091
‐That's nice.
‐Not bad.

00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,092
Yeah.

00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,927
Have you brought
any capital

00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,195
in from anybody else?

00:34:57,195 --> 00:34:59,230
No, we were profitable
after our third month

00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,666
with the seed money that Jamie
was hiding away for ‐‐

00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,435
for her business.
Congratulations.

00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,136
Why do you think you
need an investment?

00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:08,707
You've been profitable since
three months opening.
Yes.

00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:10,108
Family‐run business.
Yeah.

00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,643
Why would you want
more capital right now

00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:13,211
if you can grow
without having to worry

00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:14,679
about anybody else
but the family?

00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:18,183
The safe thing for us to do
would be to not be here.

00:35:18,183 --> 00:35:20,385
Keep doing what we're doing.
It's a great family business.

00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:21,686
Right.
We're doing well.

00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:23,588
My father passed away about
a year and a half ago.

00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:24,756
‐I'm sorry.
‐Sorry.

00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:27,292
Um, he used to say,
"Don't have regrets."

00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:29,794
He regretted a lot
of deals he didn't do,

00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:32,864
and I think we feel,
at this point in time,

00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:36,134
what we see as a strategic
partnership with a Shark

00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:39,371
to help guide us
to help us grow the business.

00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:41,740
What would
the $600,000 go for?

00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,442
So, we would use
the $600,000 to help support

00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,711
our marketing‐and‐sales
strategy,

00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,747
which would include
growing our sales team,

00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:51,950
and also helping us grow
our subscriber base

00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,585
through customer acquisition.

00:35:53,585 --> 00:35:54,853
Cuban: Yeah, that ‐‐ guys,
that's your challenge.

00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:57,956
Making $700,000 is no joke,

00:35:57,956 --> 00:36:01,793
but the hardest challenge
is refreshing content,

00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:04,095
particularly when you have
long‐term customers...
Right.

00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:06,164
...you know, because they
love it, love it, love it,

00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,599
and then, "What have you done
for me lately?"

00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,401
I just think that ‐‐
that's a big a hurdle.

00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:12,437
I‐I don't see the valuation
matching that challenge.

00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:14,572
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:16,808
I'm sorry to hear that,
but thank you.

00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:19,577
I believe that, you know,
after eight years of, uh,

00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:20,712
making newsletters,

00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:23,214
you've already figured out
something, right?

00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:29,320
I would offer you $600,000
for 17.5%.

00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,022
Thank you so much
for that offer.

00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,290
We really appreciate it.
I think you're overlooking

00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,392
a tremendous potential
in your business.

00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:38,296
I'm interested in a deal,
but only if you believe

00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:40,098
in the philosophy that
I see in the business,

00:36:40,098 --> 00:36:42,667
which is to turn it
into a franchise.

00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:45,070
I think you can make a killing
as a franchise business,

00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,771
because I think
there are so many moms

00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:48,373
who want to be involved
in a mom business

00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:49,708
where they're in charge.

00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:52,477
Not working for you,
but running their own business.

00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:54,879
So I'll make you an offer
for the $600,000,

00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,981
but I want I want 25%.
Ooh.

00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:59,784
But the contingency is,
for your sake and for mine,

00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:01,319
to turn it into a franchise.

00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:02,821
I could make you a fortune.

00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:06,124
‐Uh...
‐Do you capture any data?

00:37:06,124 --> 00:37:08,927
For example,
birthdays of the kids.

00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:10,628
We ‐‐ That's something
we've discussed.

00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:11,896
That is something ‐‐
You haven't done that yet?

00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,698
Currently, no.
Well, if you had
the birthdays

00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:16,935
of the kids,
and I have Lovepop cards,

00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:18,203
I need to know that...
Yeah.

00:37:18,203 --> 00:37:20,605
...so I can pay you
to give me that data

00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:22,107
and sell that product.
Right. I ‐‐

00:37:22,107 --> 00:37:24,042
That's where I see huge
opportunity, as well.

00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:27,378
'Cause if ‐‐ A lot of these are
birthday gifts to kids, right?
Right, yeah.

00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:29,114
No, no, I think there could be
a whole birthday program.

00:37:29,114 --> 00:37:31,449
It's something ‐‐
it's on my list.
Wow. There's so much ‐‐

00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:34,219
there's a lot of opportunity
in ‐‐ in data mining for you.

00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:35,386
Right, yes, yes.
Brian: Absolutely.

00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:36,688
I don't see
the franchising thing.

00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:38,323
I don't agree with Barbara
at all on that.

00:37:38,323 --> 00:37:40,225
I think you're mistaken.
I think you want to
control that database,

00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:41,726
'cause that's where
the value is.

00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:44,028
I would do the deal,
but on the exit,

00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:45,463
here's what I'd like,

00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:47,832
because you may be
taking more money
down the road,

00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:49,033
and, again, I have no control

00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:50,702
'cause I'm a minority
shareholder.

00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:52,837
I want to make sure
whatever happens,

00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:55,173
I get three times on my money
on the exit.

00:37:55,173 --> 00:37:57,842
So I'm gonna help you
build this thing up.

00:37:57,842 --> 00:37:59,077
I've got two or three companies,

00:37:59,077 --> 00:38:00,245
I think, that would buy this

00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:02,147
if the database
got a little better.

00:38:02,147 --> 00:38:06,351
Look, if you guaranteed me
three times on my 600K

00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:07,786
if there's an exit,

00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:11,222
I'd give you the 600K for 20%.

00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:13,758
Barbara hasn't thought enough
about it to figure that out.

00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:15,527
Uh, let me tell you,
I'm not so stupid.

00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:16,694
I don't know what
he's talking about.
I'm not as complicated.

00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:18,429
$600,000 with 17.5%,

00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:20,131
not all this other crap
they're talking about.

00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,399
And I'll share with you.

00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:23,067
I love you both, but

00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:26,504

I think you have some
very good offers here.

You're doing so amazing.

00:38:32,911 --> 00:38:35,547
I feel like you're better off
not giving away equity,

00:38:35,547 --> 00:38:38,883
and so for that reason,
I'm out.

00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:41,119

three viable offers.
