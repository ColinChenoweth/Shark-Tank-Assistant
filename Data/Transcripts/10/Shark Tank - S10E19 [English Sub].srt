Hi. My name's Eric Roy,

00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,483
and I'm a PhD chemist
from Washington, D. C.

00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,385
My company is Hydroviv,

00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,654
and I'm here
seeking $400,000

00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,057
in exchange
for a 10% stake.

00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:46,626
Sharks, have you ever
traveled to a different city

00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:48,361
and noticed that
the water tastes different

00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:49,762
than what you're used to?

00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:52,799
That's because the water's
chemistry is different.

00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:55,101
Now, of course, the real issue
with drinking water

00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:56,302
isn't taste.

00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,805
It's that tens of millions
of U. S. households

00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:00,373
have contaminants
in their water

00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:02,275
that exceed
Public Health Goal.

00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:03,843
This is crazy.

00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,645
Now, knowing
that different cities

00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:07,547
have different problems
with their water,

00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:09,248
why do water‐filter companies

00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:12,785
mass produce
one‐size‐fits‐all systems?

00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,721
It doesn't take
a PhD chemist

00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:17,256
to realize that this isn't
the best approach.

00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:20,460
Now, at Hydroviv, we take
a completely different approach.

00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,195
We build
custom water filters

00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,664
that are optimized
for each customer's water.

00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:26,432
Here's how it works.

00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,668
When you place an order
for a Hydroviv system,

00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:31,771
our "Water Nerds" dig through
water quality data

00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:33,239
for your area,

00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:36,642
then build a filter that's
actually matched to your water.

00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,378
So if you live in an area

00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,513
that's susceptible
to lead contamination,

00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:42,949
we add more
lead‐removal media.

00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:46,085
Or if you live in an area
that has high levels of arsenic,

00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:48,321
we adjust
the filter's formulation

00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:51,657
to stop the chemical
in its tracks.

00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,626
So, whether you live in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,

00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:56,162
or Reno, Nevada,
we've got you covered.

00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:59,799
Once the system's built,
we ship it to your home,

00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,367
and you're able to hook it up
under your sink

00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,269
to your existing faucet.

00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:06,172
Sharks, I've seen
how poor water quality

00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:07,740
can cripple a community,

00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,443
and at Hydroviv, we can actually
do something about it.

00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:12,745
So, who wants to be
the next Water Nerd?

00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,080
‐All right.
‐Interesting.

00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,382
Do we get samples?
‐First question I have, though.

00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:19,485
There was and still is
a clear water crisis

00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:21,154
in the state of Michigan
in many areas.
Yes, sir.

00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:23,923
Do you have a filter
that solves for that?

00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,292
So, we actually
got our start...
Oh, that's heavy.

00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:29,061
...in response to
the Flint lead disaster.

00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,897
The existing water filters
on the market

00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:33,032
weren't designed
to handle that.

00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,067
So, you know,
I was developing technology

00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:36,636
for Department of Defense
at the time.

00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:40,206
I set up in my studio apartment
in Washington, D. C.,

00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:41,441
and just started building

00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,709
high‐capacity
lead‐removal filters

00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,344
and donating them to people

00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,947
and child‐centric
organizations in Flint.
Wow.

00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,583
‐Wow.
‐How much is the filter?

00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,586
Average sales price
is right around $190.

00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:56,856
It costs us $48 to make, build,
and ship it to the customer.

00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:59,192
‐We have free shipping.
‐How long does the filter last?

00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:02,028
Six months.
So, I want to buy
two filters, don't I?

00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:04,530
Well, you want to buy
your up‐front system,

00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,698
and then you want
to subscribe.

00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:09,735
The cartridge itself
costs us about $10 total.

00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:12,004
And then every six months, how
much does it cost me to buy it?

00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,873
$55.25.

00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:16,142
What does this year look like?
Let's look at the numbers.

00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,644
So, we'll do
just over $325,000.

00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,480
‐$325,000?
‐Yes, sir.

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,316
We're gonna
do $1.7 million next year.

Greiner: Okay, what stood out
to me is that

00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,659
you said you take out
arsenic, lead.

00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,395
So let's take just
an easy, simple,

00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38,231
inexpensive thing
like a Brita, right?
Mm‐hmm.

00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:39,632
You fill it up
with water.

00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:41,701
Does that take out
any of those things?
No.

00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:44,837
I mean, there are others
that will remove lead.

00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,540
There's others that
will remove arsenic.

00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,375
The problem is
when you mass produce

00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,010
that single formulation,

00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,646
there's only so much space
in these cartridges, right?

00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:57,450
So if you're ‐‐ If you're trying
to do everything all at once,

00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,752
you don't really
do anything very well.

00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,821
Whereas what we're doing is
we're actually looking at

00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:03,723
what that is in your water

00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:05,791
and then blending
the filter cartridge ‐‐

00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,694
How many people have,
though, lead, arsenic ‐‐

00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,697
A lot.
Is there anything proprietary
about your filters?

00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,932
Is it patented
in any way?

00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:15,935
So, we have a nonprovisional
utility patent.

00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:17,169
So, it's multiple claims.

00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,438
One is the method
to rapidly,

00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:22,275
um, assess and build
custom cartridges.

00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:25,778
Another is the actual
construction of that cartridge.

00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:28,548
The question for me is,
how do you plan on

00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:31,250
creating the awareness of
the fact there's a problem?

00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,387
Because at the moment,
in America at least,

00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,322
I don't feel people
think there's a problem.

00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:37,690
We're gonna
start advertising.

00:40:33,398 --> 00:40:37,535
Because I totally adore you
for being all‐in,

00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:40,371
but I totally
mistrust your judgment...

00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:41,739
‐Yeah, and I get that. I‐‐
‐...because of how the money

00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:43,574
was spent and
what the net result was.

00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:46,411
So, I'm sorry.
I'm out, too.

You know, b‐basically what
Barbara just said to you, Jim,

00:40:50,348 --> 00:40:51,816
is you need
adult supervision.

00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:53,117
‐No, I didn't say that.

I have made
mistakes, and ‐‐

O'Leary: No, and ‐‐
and everybody here

00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:00,091
appreciates the honestly
on that.

00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:02,026
But, you know, this is
now the real world.

00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:04,562
This is investing.
You're asking for $500,000.

00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:06,030
That's not a small
amount of money.

00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:10,301
I actually think you should
take the $1.7 million hit

00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,403
and move on.

00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:14,772
Every investor here
has made mistakes.

00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:16,074
Yep.
I don't have
a perfect portfolio.

00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:17,175
‐Nobody does.
‐Yeah.

00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:20,311
I can't go on this journey
into oblivion.

00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,980
I'm out.

00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,414
I'm sorry
to hear that, Kevin.

00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:27,785
Every entrepreneur has crises ‐‐
every single one of them.

00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:29,554
Some own up to it,
some don't.

00:41:29,554 --> 00:41:30,822
It's what you do now

00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:32,690
that really is gonna
define your business.

00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,093
Normally, there is
a path somewhere.

00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:36,194
You just have to find it.

00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:37,695
Yours is gonna be difficult,

00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:39,263
and what I've found
in those situations

00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:42,533
is that I go
to my biggest customer,

00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:43,835
and I'm brutally honest,

00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:46,571
and just lay it all on the table
like you did for us,

00:41:46,571 --> 00:41:48,906
and try to find a way
to work with them and say,

00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:50,808
"Look, I've got
all this inventory.

00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:51,909
Work with me."

00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:54,479
And really discount it to cost
if you have

00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:56,881
to to move out
of your inventory.

00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:58,483
Learn your lessons,

00:41:58,483 --> 00:42:00,385
use whatever cash that
you create from that,

00:42:00,385 --> 00:42:03,154
and then start moving forward
as a smarter person

00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:04,522
and smarter about
your industry.

00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,723
But?

00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:06,858
It's ‐‐ It's not
a fit for me,

00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:09,427
so for those reasons,
I'm out.

‐All right.

00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,897

‐Yes. Good luck.
