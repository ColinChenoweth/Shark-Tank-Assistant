around and doing it all badly.

looked at me and said,

"You haven't done this
for a while, have you?"

you could increase the price

made by hand?

00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:47,947
Yeah, 'cause your margins
are low, honestly.

00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:49,648
What set me back
in the beginning

00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:50,850
is I went viral, right,

00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,218
and I did not know
what I was doing.

00:20:52,218 --> 00:20:54,687
Everyone took advantage of that
and jumped on

00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:55,955
and tried to rip me off
and steal.

00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:57,590
So I had to take a break.

your patents?

to sell $2 million.

And what are your sales
year‐to‐date?

00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:05,898
$188,000.

Okay.

00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,205

the rest of the year?

00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:16,709
Absolutely. We have so many
people from all over the world.

to $2 million.

00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,887

is that ‐‐

00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:29,121
First of all,
the towels really work.

00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,791

But that's not the problem.
We all assume it works.

You have to make it to get
the $2 million in sales,

00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:35,795
and you've only got
six months.

inventory on hand.

00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,034
Do you have $2 million
worth of inventory right now?

00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,235
Oh, no, no,
not $2 million.

00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:46,572
Here's the problem.
A lot of things aren't
adding up right now.

00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:47,973
You had this viral moment.

00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,975
That propelled sales
in a short period of time

00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,544
to $1 million.
Yes.

00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:52,845
You come into this year,

00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:54,013
and you don't have
the viral moment

00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:55,848
and you have
all the aggravation

00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:57,716
of shutting down
all the knock‐offs.

00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,885
But $250,000 in inventory

00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:02,488
equals a half a million dollars
in sales.
Uh‐huh.

00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:03,222
So you got to be able

00:22:03,222 --> 00:22:07,193
to turn your inventory
four times, basically ‐‐

00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:10,763

No.

00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:16,802
Wait, I don't think
there's any way in the world

00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:18,904
that you're getting
to $2 million in sales

00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:20,973
unless you have another one
of those viral moments.

00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:23,075
Well, that's why I'm here,
honestly, is,

00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:26,078

it's also going global.

‐Forget about global.

You've got to show it working
in the U. S. market.

You're kind of
making my case, right,

00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,758
because to think that
the world is your oyster

00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:41,193
and if you only sell
the entire world,

00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,928
then you're gonna get
$2 million,

00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,797
it doesn't really
work that way.

00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:46,832
You're just a little bit
too scattered for me.

I'm out.

Okay. Well, thank you.

00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:52,738
Erin, the words
"I have all this inventory,

00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:53,939
and I don't know
what to do with it"

00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:55,908
is pretty scary
to an investor.
Never good. Yeah.

00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:57,843
I shouldn't have said, "I don't
know what to do with it."

00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:58,978
Well, I know,
but you <i>did</i> say it.

00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:01,146
And it doesn't mean that
you have to be punished for it.

00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:04,783
What it means, though,
is there's no strategic plan.

00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:05,985
It's not selling, Erin.

00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:07,419
However, when I went viral,

00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:10,756
that inventory I'm sitting on
would be completely gone.

00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:12,091

how far I've gotten.
