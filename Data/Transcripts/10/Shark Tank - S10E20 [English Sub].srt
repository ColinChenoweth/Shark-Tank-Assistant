00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,259
It's the perfect home
for Bantam Bagels.

00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:22,762
Your role is gonna be
to continue to lead and dream,

00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:24,731
and our role is gonna be
to support that growth.

00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:27,934
Greiner:
This is the kind of deal that
every entrepreneur dreams of.

00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:30,570
They got a $34 million buyout,

00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,138
plus they get to stay in,

00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:34,407
running the business
as the innovators.

00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:36,509
Nick and Elyse,
welcome to your new family.

00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:37,844
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:40,847
Every entrepreneur wants
to invent something that lasts.

00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:42,815
It's like, somebody created
the croissant,

00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,717
somebody created
the English muffin,

00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,754
and Nick and Elyse have created
the Bantam Bagels,

00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:49,255
and it's their legacy.

00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,757
You guys are the best!

00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:51,891
Nick: Five years ago,

00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,259
we gave up our steady jobs
on Wall Street

00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,360
to start Bantam Bagels

00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,928
in our small apartment kitchen
in Brooklyn.

00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,230
With this deal,
we have the opportunity

00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,431
to grow Bantam Bagels

00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:00,266
to be the household brand
we know it can be.

00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:01,434

My company is SPARE.

00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,170
I'm seeking $500,000
for 3.5% of our company.

00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,871
Ooh.

00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,706
We've all had the experience
of searching too far

00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,809
and too wide for an ATM.

00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,343
There's never one
near when you need it,

00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,145
and, unfortunately,
when you do find one,

00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,613

I spent $5 just for
$20 of my own money.

00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,555
Mm.
That seems a bit
ridiculous, right?

00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,123
Well, fun fact ‐‐

00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,392
the average ATM fee
in the United States

00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:03,095
just last year was $4.69.

00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,731
There weren't a whole lot of
options until we came along.

00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:07,533
SPARE's a virtual ATM network

00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,469
that provides cheaper,
more secure

00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,103
and convenient access to cash,

00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,739
all from the comfort, security,
and convenience

00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,875
of your mobile phone.

00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,510
Getting cash
with SPARE is easy.

00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,045
Once you connect
your bank account

00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:20,646
or digital wallet to the app,

00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,615
you select the amount of cash
that you need.

00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:25,551
The map will then populate
with all the merchants nearby

00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,553
that are willing
to dispense that cash.

00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,155
You're given a one‐time use code

00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,057
that you then scan
for verification.

00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:33,326
Scan the code
and get your cash.

00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,228
You're on your way.
It's just that simple.

00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:37,430
You get the cash you need
at a cheaper rate

00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,998
than using a third‐party ATM.

00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,199
And the best part?

00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,667
You're supporting local business

00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,437
with increased foot traffic
and revenue.

00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:47,073
From tourists to video‐game
players with virtual tokens

00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:48,074
they want to cash out

00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:49,442
to prepaid card users

00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:52,345
or on to the much larger
global marketplace

00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,580
of the unbanked
or underbanked.

00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,551
So, Sharks, who wants to invest
their spare cash in SPARE?

00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:00,720
Greiner: So, that's ‐‐
that's interesting to me.

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,788
So, what's the rate?

00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:05,391
If, let's say,
I need 20 bucks?
$3.

00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,827
The way the split works
is we get roughly 1/3,

00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:09,729
and we split 1/3 with that ‐‐
with the merchant.

00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:11,964
And then, of course, there are
processors in that equation.

00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,066
And who does
the other third go to?
Uh, our processors.

00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,235
So anyone ‐‐
Okay, so you're using
a third‐party network.

00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:17,303
‐Exactly, yes.
‐Okay.

00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:19,338
How much can I take out?
Can I take $500 out?

00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:22,408
So, as of right now, we do
max the system at $100.

00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:23,876
‐But the thing ‐‐
‐How do you find your merchants,

00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,312
and how many do you actually
have in your network?

00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:27,847
So, over
the past couple years,

00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:30,182
we've amassed a little
over 2,700 merchants.

00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:32,919
Those are regular, small,
mom‐and‐pop‐shop businesses

00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:35,154
that really value the increased
foot traffic and ‐‐

00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,489
And that's over
what period of time?

00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,024
That's over
the past 2 1/2 years.

00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:39,926
Okay, so that's
your problem right now.

00:17:39,926 --> 00:17:42,795
Well, so ‐‐ so allow me
to expand on that.

00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:46,632
So you all ‐‐ I heard your
exclamation at the valuation.

00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,100
That's just a gag reflex,
'cause,

00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,603
you know, 3.5%?
Come on. Seriously?
Of course.

00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:53,573
But your numbers may
actually make me ‐‐

00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:54,974
make you right, so...
‐Yes, so let me get

00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:56,676
to one important
number for you.

00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,611
My vision for this company
has to become ‐‐

00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:01,080
to be the ubiquitous
cash‐out option.

00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,983
The only way for us to do that
successfully and virally

00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:05,952
is to partner with
a hardware company.

00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:07,186
We've done that.

00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,055
A company by the name of BVPOS

00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:11,090
has come in as
our strategic hardware partner.

00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,092
Why hardware?

00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,527
They have 933,000 units

00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:17,196
that will be uploading
our software to their units.

00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:19,332
You're saying they have
registers in the stores already.

00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:21,067
They ‐‐ Yes, they already do.
They have ‐‐
Okay.

00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:22,802
They have units like this one
you see here.

00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:25,671
‐In every state? How many ‐‐
‐BVPOS is what, technically?

00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:28,441
They are a POS‐hardware
manufacturing company,

00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,942
one of the five largest
in the world.
So they provide
the register

00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,844
and the print of
the receipt system

00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,346
for all
the small stores.
That's correct.
Yes, that is correct.

00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:34,947
But are they already
in that many stores

00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,316
and in multiple cities?
‐Yes, absolutely.

00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,151
‐Are they in every state?
‐Who aren't they in, right?

00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:41,821
Because 933,000 seems
like a huge number...

00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:45,124
Absolutely.
...but relative to the,
you know, retail landscape,

00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,927
et cetera, that's not
a big number, right?
Correct,

00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:49,295
and so, they're
a smaller company.

00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,663
So one of the biggest
issues that we had

00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:52,031
as we wanted
to scale this vision out

00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,332
was proof of concept.

00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:54,934
You go to a chain like 7‐Eleven,

00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,135
and you're like,
"Partner with us."

00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,603
They go, "Go get volume."

00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:58,738
So that's what we did.

00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:00,539
We proved with
our 2,700 locations,

00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,375
which is incredibly small...
‐Right.

00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,377
...that we could add value
to our customers.

00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:05,645
How many transactions
are you doing a day?

00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,647
So, on average, we hit
somewhere around the mark

00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,748
of 2,500 to 2,700.

00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:10,016
‐A day?
‐Right now?

00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:11,217
‐A day, yes.
‐Wow.

00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:12,251
‐2,500?
‐Yes.

00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:13,252
O'Leary:
And how many locations

00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,654
do you have right now?
That's a lot.

00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,389
‐2,700. A little over 2,700.
‐No, it's not a big number,

00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:17,923
'cause they only make
a buck a transaction.
Exactly.

00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,659
It's not a big number.
‐Yeah, but it's a big number

00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,694
for how many ‐‐
for just starting.

00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,629
And what is your background
prior to this?

00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,865
So, my background, um, I used
to work at J. P. Morgan,

00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:29,568
and I had this brilliant idea
[chuckles] in 2010

00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,370
that I would become
an entrepreneur.

00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,571
But I've gone through
the process

00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:35,141
of sleeping on couches,
sleeping in my car,

00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:37,109
all to raise money
for this thing

00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,712
that I think adds
mass amounts of value.

00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:42,048
‐How much money have you raised?
‐$500,000 to date.

00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:44,116
‐Okay. From who?
‐Um, friends and family,

00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,552
and then we also had a small
convertible‐note round.

00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:48,688
And what was ‐‐ what's the cap
on the convertible note?

00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,489
The convertible‐note round
at that time was $9 million.

00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:51,657
‐$9 million?
‐Yes.

00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:52,792
‐$9 million?
‐Wow.

00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:53,859
‐Yes.
‐Wow.

00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,428
O'Leary: How did you
convince anybody

00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:57,530
to buy into
a $9 million valuation?

00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,398
I don't get that at all.
‐D'ontra's a sales guy.

00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,801
‐[ Chuckles ]
‐So, um, yes, I am a sales ‐‐

00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:03,202
D'ontra, can I
ask you a question

00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,837
about the difference
in cost?

00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:06,605
So, I use you,
I pay $3.

00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:09,075
I use any other ATM,
of which there's millions...

00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:11,010
‐Yes.
‐...I pay $4.69,

00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,612
so 1.69% more.

00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:17,616
Am I actually gonna walk
an extra block for 1.69%?

00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:19,752
Do I really give a...

00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:21,487
‐You do if you ‐‐
‐No, but that's proximity.

00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:22,922
It's not the walk. It's ‐‐
‐Well, here's the thing.

00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:25,257
You do care if you're part
of the unbanked

00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:26,859
or underbanked
population.

00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:29,195
What you call
"underbanked population,"

00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:30,563
I wasn't sure
what that meant.

00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,232
Underbanked is someone who
doesn't have the same access

00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,167
to financial tools
as everyone in ‐‐

00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,269
as the people
in this room, frankly.
So they don't have
a Citibank card. I see.

00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,205
Cuban: When I was broke and
sleeping on the couch, right,

00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:40,973
I couldn't open up
a bank account, right?

00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,374
You needed
to have 200 bucks.

00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,542
You needed this,
you needed that, right?

00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:45,578
‐I see.
‐They didn't give me one.

00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:48,013

00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:21,200
Well, D‐Daymond,
you actually almost nailed

00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,569
our color and
sizing profile.

00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:26,705
I am definitely looking
at this as "Less is more."

00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:30,442
I want to see the 20% of the
SKUs that do 80% of the business

00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:32,744
and kind of mitigate
the risk from there.

00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:36,448
I think that I've missed on
about $100,000 in lost sales

00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:37,849
in the last 12 months

00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:39,685
because of some opportunities
that have come up

00:28:39,685 --> 00:28:42,421
where I didn't have
inventory available.

00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:43,889
Part of the reason that
I didn't was because

00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,558
I didn't have enough cash
to make more,

00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,193
which is part of the reason
that I'm here today.

00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:49,494
Kyle, can I tell you
what's gonna be

00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:51,997
the huge challenge
in this business?

00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:54,433
Um, I learned a most valuable
lesson recently

00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:56,101
buying into
the Comfy brand.

00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:58,637
Only had two prototypes ‐‐
nothing else.

00:28:58,637 --> 00:29:01,406
And in nine months, they've had
$25 million in sales.

00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:04,276
What was the appeal of
that garment that they had?

00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:07,846
And I felt like I'd found
what the secret sauce was.

00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:11,783
One SKU, one size to
a huge audience of people

00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:13,318
that found
a use for it.

00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:16,755
I think this has too many SKUs,
it's too narrow‐market,

00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,424
and on top of that,
I think it's on trend

00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:22,361
because overalls
are so popular,

00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:24,162
but I don't think
that's going to last.

00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:27,366
And I just don't think
it's gonna be an easy climb

00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:28,600
to make money on this.

00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,235

Okay. Thank you, Barbara.

00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:35,440
To kind of answer some of
Barbara's concerns,

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,242
I want to take a step back
and tell you guys

00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:39,745
what I plan to do
with the money.

00:29:39,745 --> 00:29:41,179
And the first thing
I plan to do

00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:43,515
is to scale production
in the existing inventory

00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:46,385
with the SKUs
that I know are working.

00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:47,886
The second thing
that I want to do

00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:50,455
is to diversify

youth, and infant.

Another area where people have
been reaching out to me a ton

00:29:57,396 --> 00:29:59,064
is the college market.

00:29:59,064 --> 00:30:01,133

all splintered markets ‐‐

you're kind of answering

all the questions
the wrong way,

00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:05,137
in my opinion, right,

00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,772
because
if there was enough demand ‐‐

00:30:06,772 --> 00:30:09,241
You talked about selling
out with the inventory
you had, right?

00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:11,410
But if you saw
enough intrinsic demand,

00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,011
you wouldn't
have to be thinking about

00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:14,479
all these other markets.

00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,248
It would be,
"I can't keep up,"

00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:17,916
and that's not the sense
I'm getting,

00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:20,619

I'm out.

5% of that.

00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,710

for 10 to 15 years,

on that goal

00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:22,214

Nick, you have 28

That's correct.

pay for this?

And what does it cost you
to make it?

So, it's currently
$15.49.

00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,639
Okay. And what's your cost
to make?

00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:44,643
So, the cost of a box

However, the landed cost

‐Maybe ask your wife.

Right. But do you want
to bother your wife

00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:49,541
while you're sleeping?
‐Mm.

00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,776
And also, on top of that,
snoring is a disorder.

00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:54,045
You don't want to snore because
it's gonna cause you to have

other health issues.

00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,315
It could lead to sleep apnea.

00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:59,217
As a matter of fact, the reason
we started the business

00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:02,053
is because my father,
who is a practicing internist,

00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,823
he was diagnosed 10 years ago
with obstructive sleep apnea.

00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:05,990
If you're familiar with it,

00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:08,126
you'll know that
they give you usually a CPAP.

That's what
you're first prescribed.

00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,529
Sometimes you're prescribed
what's called

00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:14,165
a mandibular advancement device
that pushes the jaw forward.

00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:16,167
My father couldn't use
either of those,

00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:17,936
because he was
mouth‐breathing.

00:37:17,936 --> 00:37:19,070

‐Yes.

We actually have

We also have international

Oh, my gosh. So that's where

It was about $350,000,

associated with
starting a company.

00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:45,757
That gave us

00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:47,992
That got us

00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,894

from Harvard Medical School.

00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:51,496

Our month‐over‐month growth
has averaged 31%.

And even though we're only done
a little over $350,000 so far,

00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:03,942
to finish out the year, we'll
probably add another $350,000

or $400,000 in revenues.

I mean, that's the first one
I've ever seen.

00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:09,794
Michalak: I'm humbled.

00:42:09,794 --> 00:42:11,696
I'm grateful
to have an entrepreneur

00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:14,198
like Mark Cuban
who sees our vision.

00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:18,469
I was expecting him to actually
offer an even lower valuation.

00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:20,605
He ended up offering
right at our floor.

00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:22,040
I was happy to accept it.

00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,176
And I can't wait to get
started working with him.
