what you're thinking ‐‐

"What is Chicken Bang Dip?"

I was thinking.

Well, Sharks,
do I have a treat for you.

00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:49,421
Yeah!

00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:50,522
I came up with this

00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:55,026
chicken‐y, cheesy,
saucy, spinach‐y,

00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:56,828
scrum‐diddly‐umptious dip

00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:59,798
that will keep folks
coming back for more.

In short, you can
put this Bang on anything!

‐Mm, I like to bang things.
‐Anything!

00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:09,741
I put it on rice, pasta,
vegetables, a burrito.

00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:12,277

on my omelette.

don't eat chicken.

No problem!
I have a vegetarian version

00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:22,621
that I use zucchini in
instead of chicken.

‐No!

by my mom,

and, uh, we didn't have much,

00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,870

felt that it was my job

to take care of the family.

newspapers.

for other people,

00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,600

that I'd put together,

to any type of get‐together.

done that?

all over the country

out of crock pots ‐‐

at a second farmer's market.

is very competitive,

For that reason,
I'm out.

00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:57,655
I‐I respect that,
Daymond.

00:40:57,655 --> 00:40:59,190
Here's the thing.

00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,758
You know,
I love the dip,

00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:03,628
and I believe that
you could sell anything.

00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:08,800
You have a very charismatic
personality that people like.

00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,269
I wish you luck,
but right now,

00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:13,604
it's too early for me,
so I'm out.

00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:16,374
Thank you, Lori.

00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:17,976
Jason, you came here
too early.

00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:19,677
I don't need a job.

00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:21,012
What I need to do
is use my leverage

00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:22,847
to make more money
with you.

00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:23,982
This isn't
investable, yet.

00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:24,849
I'm out.

00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:26,818
Thank you, Kevin.

Yeah, you know,
uh, Jason,

00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:33,524
there's a transition
between being a salesman

00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:34,892
and being
a business guy.

00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:37,261
If you had
a package with you...

00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:38,763
‐Yes.
‐...if you would've said, "Look,

00:41:38,763 --> 00:41:42,133
I've had a test run
in this store," I'm gonna say

00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:45,236
I think you would've got
an investment today.

00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:46,571
You had a kid at 15.

00:41:46,571 --> 00:41:48,806
I can't imagine the pressure
and responsibility of that.

00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:52,910
I mean, that's real life
responsibility.

00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,746
If you can do that,

00:41:54,746 --> 00:41:56,114
you can learn this.
‐Yes.

00:41:56,114 --> 00:41:57,015
You're gonna fail,

00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:58,182
and you're gonna get
knocked down,

00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,283
but you just got to keep going.

00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:00,651
You just got to keep going.
You'll do it.

00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:02,286
For now I'm out.

00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:04,922
Thanks, Robert.
Thank you.

00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:06,524
I appreciate it, guys.
‐Good luck, Jason.

00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,692
‐This is really good.
‐Thank you.

00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:09,660
‐Just heart‐breaking,
you know.

00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,962
The amount of work
that it would take

00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:12,030
to get this launched...
There's just so much work.

00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,164
Unbelievable.

00:42:13,164 --> 00:42:14,432
Herjavec:
You know, that's the problem.

00:42:14,432 --> 00:42:15,867
After 10 years,
you learn how much work it is.

00:42:17,502 --> 00:42:20,938
Hadley: I've given it everything
that I have, and it's mine.

00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:23,174
It's not gonna stop.
I'm gonna keep going.

00:42:23,174 --> 00:42:25,610
You know, this Bang Shack train
is not stopping.
