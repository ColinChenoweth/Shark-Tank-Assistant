00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:35,480
and then we re‐created
and built the housings for it

00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,349
and built some new mechanisms
around it.

00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,518
What do you sell them
for and what does it
cost to make them?

00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:41,786
Yeah, and how many
have you sold?

00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:43,255
The white and the Bamboo,

00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:45,657
those are our Minimalist
and our Natural.

00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:46,925
They retail for $235.

00:33:46,925 --> 00:33:49,027
Our ‐‐
‐$235?

00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,530
Yes. And our clear
Baller retails for $265.

00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,064
‐And what are your costs?
‐And how many have you sold?

00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:55,267
‐We've sold 800 to date.
‐800,000?

00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:57,202
800 units.

00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:58,470
In how many years?

00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:01,506
We just received our inventory
in April of 2018.

00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:03,808
You didn't mention what you ‐‐
what they cost to make.

00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:07,546
Yes. So, our costs are currently
$80 landed for the units,

00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:09,848
but I've been on
an absolute binge

00:34:09,848 --> 00:34:12,284
reducing our costs over
the last couple of months,

00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:15,253
and I have them down
to about 25% to 30%.

00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:18,056
Well, you have great margins ‐‐
$80 versus $235.

00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,258
Greiner: Yeah, why are you
doing such a high margin?

00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:22,193
'Cause you don't need to,
and, you know,

00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:24,563
for a desk
like this, it ‐‐

00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:27,532
it seems pretty
expensive, right?

00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,534
Grohowski: This is actually one
of the lowest‐priced desks

00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:30,902
that you can get
in an office environment.

00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,605
That's true.
So when we talk
to people in offices,

00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:36,808
they're actually blown away
about how inexpensive it is

00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:37,976
compared
to everything else.

00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:39,744
Yours is $235.

00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,280
What's a typical stand‐up desk?
I just don't know what it is.

00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,549
I mean, your typical
full standing desk

00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:47,552
can range from $500
anywhere up to $2,000.

00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:50,121
So, there aren't
cheap models out there?

00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:52,524
We're kind of that add‐on
into your office ‐‐

00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:55,060
or especially in the apartment,
your studio apartment.

00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,462
We're kind of the only option
for a standing desk.

00:34:57,462 --> 00:35:00,231
So, Mike, you've sold about
$70,000 altogether,

00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:02,968
$80,000.
‐We're at about $162,000.

00:35:02,968 --> 00:35:05,136
This month,
we'll close $100,000.
And that was all
on your own website.

00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:06,471
Oh, this month,
you're gonna do $100,000?

00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:07,739
‐We're gonna do $100,000.
‐What happened?

00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:09,874
So we started marketing
in the direct‐to‐consumer space,

00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:11,309
but strictly
on our website.

00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:13,278
What we started noticing
is companies

00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:15,113
were buying
dozens of units.

00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,048
So at that time,
we realized,

00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:20,151
"Okay, let's, um, focus
on the B2B market."

00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,854
There was a big large
furniture expo in Chicago.

00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:25,757
We didn't have $10,000
to throw out for a booth,

00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:28,693
so we got scrappy and
we put up four DeskViews

00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:30,295
on the side
of a coffee shop.

00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:32,697
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
And so that was
in the main thoroughfare.

00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:34,099
There were people coming out
of the coffee shop,

00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:35,867
and they knew
exactly what to do.

00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:37,202
They were using it,
as you can see.
Greiner:
It makes them stand there.

00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:39,704
Tell us about you guys.
How did you come up with this?

00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:42,707
I, uh, got my B. S.
with studies

00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:44,909
at Cornell, Harvard,
and Oxford

00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:46,911
and then went on
and got my JD/MBA

00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:48,413
at the University
of Pennsylvania.

00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:52,083
Went on, practiced three years
in commercial litigation

00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,552
and then three years
in corporate transactional law.

00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:56,721
I got put
inside an office

00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:59,090
that I just couldn't put
a standing desk in.

00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:02,360
I actually went to the doctor,
and my doctor said,

00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,497
"Mike, you have tendonitis
everywhere from the hip down."

00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:06,831
It was from sitting down.
I mean, we're ‐‐

00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,668
we're cranking 80‐,
100‐hour‐plus weeks regularly,

00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,436
and I was just
stuck sitting.

00:36:11,436 --> 00:36:13,538
But I had these
floor‐to‐ceiling windows

00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:15,140
'cause we were
in a downtown office.

00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,908
I was like,
"That's perfect."

00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:19,344
So I started
building, tinkering.

00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:22,714
I did the first 18 prototypes
with $200 in cash.

00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:25,417
‐Good for you.
‐So there was some demand,

00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:26,785
especially
in my office.

00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:28,586
Everyone's like, "What is that?
Where did you get that?"

00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:30,188
Started selling those
a little bit,

00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,023
and it was actually about
time that I met Jason.

00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,292
Yeah. So, uh, we met
through a mutual friend,

00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:36,294
and he showed me
the initial prototype of this,

00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:37,595
and immediately
it clicked in my head,

00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:40,198
because I spent the past six
years working with companies

00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,200
talking to executives.
"We want standing desks.

00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,302
Our employees are demanding
them, but they're so expensive."

00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:45,370
You're a furniture guy,
Jason?

00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,305
Uh, commercial
real estate broker.

00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:49,541
I don't know
if I see it as a desk.

00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,710
The surface area
is just too small.

00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,111
Well, one second.
I'll actually show you

00:36:53,111 --> 00:36:54,379
another one that ‐‐

00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,314
Bolos: 'Cause I never stop
working on innovation.

00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:59,250
But over time,
the square foot per employee

00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,352
in company offices has gone
from 250 square feet

00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:04,155
down to 120.
‐I don't disagree with you.

00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:06,157
That's why people
want to stand.

00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:08,426
So, this guy,
I call the Big Baller.

00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:10,328
Um...
‐The Big Baller.

00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:13,264
14 inches deep.
Yeah. So, we added
a couple more inches

00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:15,100
for those that
have larger laptops.
What price
is that gonna be?

00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,935
We're gonna
price that $275.

00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:20,772
Corcoran: Can I speak from
a perspective of an employer?

00:37:20,772 --> 00:37:22,207
When I built my offices,

00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:24,109
I was meticulous
about the design

00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:26,678
and hated it
when my salespeople

00:37:26,678 --> 00:37:29,214
even put their kids in frames
on their desk shelves.

00:37:29,214 --> 00:37:31,316
It just messed
the whole place up.

00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:34,452
You spend tons of money, you
want gorgeous corporate office,

00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:36,855
and then people start
bringing their tchotchke.

00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:38,456
I hated it.

00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:42,127
To a corporate client, B2B,
which is your specific model,

00:37:42,127 --> 00:37:44,429
you want someone
to buy 50 of them.

00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,965
Could you imagine 50 of these
along the plate‐glass windows

00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:48,133
of an office building
in Midtown Manhattan?

00:37:48,133 --> 00:37:49,367
‐It's terrible.
‐Good point.

00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:52,337
I see it as a consumer,
individual‐sale market.

00:37:52,337 --> 00:37:54,506
I really do.
So I don't believe, frankly,

00:37:54,506 --> 00:37:56,941
in any of the directions
you're going in,

00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,310
so I'll have
to graciously step out.

00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:03,281
I think it's a beautifully
designed product.

00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,516
You've obviously put

00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:06,184
an incredible amount
of work on it.

00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:07,585
It's so sturdy.

00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:09,020
But, you know,

00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,556
I'm kind of sitting here, and
I wouldn't use it as a desk.

00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:15,093
I can't get there. I'm out.
‐Thank you.

00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:16,361
I mean, I can see it
as a complement ‐‐ I mean,

00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:18,630
you know, to my desk
or in my office

00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,831
or if someone's coming in
from the outside ‐‐

00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:21,232
keep two of them
in the closet

00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:22,967
and setting them up
where you need it.

00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,069
But, you know,
I agree with Barb

00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:26,938
that I see these more
in the home.

00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:29,140
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,276
‐Okay. Thank you.
‐Thank you.

00:38:31,276 --> 00:38:34,813
I prefer this selling
directly to consumers online.

00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:36,047
The margins
are pretty good.

00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:38,850
I don't mind exploring
the, um...

00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,451
the whole thing, B2B.

00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:42,520
But you're gonna find out
how tough that is,

00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,556
and it just ‐‐
it just sucks cash.

00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:46,991
Look,

00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,459
I'll make you an offer.

00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:49,594
‐Wow.
‐Wow.

00:38:49,594 --> 00:38:51,996
I'll give you the $150,000.
I want 15%.

00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:55,099
Thank you
for the offer.

00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:56,801
I don't see it
as a permanent desk

00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:58,570
for somebody
using it all day long.

00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,505
But I thought it was
really interesting,

00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:03,174
I actually think,
for commercial space.

00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,810
Like, you know,
there's never enough room

00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,478
at a Starbucks
or this or that.

00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:08,813
I thought
that was really smart.

00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:11,182
But I don't like
your price point.

00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,518
I've done a lot of products
over the years,

00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,920
and the one thing I know
is things that soar,

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,589
things that
really do great,

00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:20,525
are things that are a good idea
that people like,

00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:23,027
but if you can give it to them
at an affordable price,

00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,562
if they're
on the fence at all,

00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:26,097
they're gonna buy it.

00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:29,567
I respect the margin that
you feel you want to make.

00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:33,238
The big question is,
is really how low can it go?

00:39:33,238 --> 00:39:35,640
So, with what
I've been able to do

00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,774
over the past
couple of months,

00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:38,276
plus the volume‐based
discounts,

00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:41,212
we should be at around
$45 landed, $46 landed.

00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,447
So you can
cut it in half.

00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:43,815
‐Yeah.
‐Yes.

00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:46,217
All right, I'm gonna give you

Kevin has offered $150,000
