00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,597
When it comes to investing,

00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:27,166
nothing's hotter right now
than cryptocurrency.

00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,334
Everyone's talking about it,

00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,370
but does anyone really know
what they're talking about?

00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,338
Now, cryptocurrency
is a digital currency,

00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,374
so investing in it
is a little different.

00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,476
Now, you could mine
your own currency,

00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:39,278
which is best done
with a dedicated mining chip.

00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:40,346
Essentially, you're using

00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,348
decentralized
blockchain technology

00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,283
to track shares
and validate transactions

00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,352
using a known algorithm.

00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:48,454
These are then added
to the existing blockchain

00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,390
using an ‐‐
an encryption technique

00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,492
that controls the creation
of monetary units

00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:55,661
and ultimately verifies
the transfer of funds.

[ Sighs ]

00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:01,534
That's one way.
Or you could just use Bundil,

00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:05,238
the most convenient way
to invest in cryptocurrency.

00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,106
Bundil allows...

00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,175
Oh, shoot.

00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,544
The Bundil app allows, um...

00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:14,313
users to automatically invest
their spare change every day

00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:18,084

Sorry about that.

Dmitri, this is the biggest

‐Shut up, Kevin.
‐I agree. I agree.

00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,231
Bundil is
a mobile application

00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,300
that allows you to invest
your spare change

00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,436
from everyday purchases
directly into crypto.

00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:41,140
Um, the app, uh, automatically
tracks your spending habits.

00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,343
So, if you were to go buy
this coffee for $3.45,

00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,546
the 55 cents would
be rounded automatically

00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:49,649
and invested into the
cryptocurrency of your choice.

00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,619
Um...

00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,289
you don't need thousands
of dollars to start investing.

00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,523
Just keep doing
what you're doing,

00:15:57,523 --> 00:16:00,092
leave the complicated math
and algorithms behind,

00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,461
and Bundil will take care
of the rest.

00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,096
So, which one of you wants
to hop on board with Bundil

00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,398

you could possibly...
Yeah.

what is cryptocurrency?

You'd be breaking
entirely new ground

if you could explain it.

00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:17,243
Oh, for sure.
So, it's just like money

00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:18,711
and, in a small way,
kind of like stocks.

It's like money in that you can
use it for purchases of ‐‐

uh, for services and goods.

00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:27,386
Um, it's like stocks because,
um, the value fluctuates.

00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,155
Dmitri, why don't you give us
a little insight

00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,990
into, uh, what gave you
this idea?

00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,325
I'm a web developer myself,

00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,427
and I wanted to invest
in cryptocurrency,

00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:35,862
and my family
also wanted to invest,

00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:39,165
so they came to me and
they're like, "Dmitri,
how do we buy this?

00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,366
Like, what do we do?"
So I thought,

00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:42,368
I was like, "Man, you know,

00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,470
anyone that's trying to invest
in cryptocurrency

00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,239
has to go through all
these steps,

00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:48,274
um, to try and figure out
how to buy it,"

00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:51,110
and I thought there could be
an easier way for it to be done.

00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,411
Which cryptos
does it support?

00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,447
Uh, so right now,
it only supports, uh,

00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:56,382
Bitcoin, Ethereum,
and Litecoin.

00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:57,550
How does Bundil
make money?

00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,186
We charge a monthly fee
of $3 a month,

00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:03,289
or, if you pay
for the entire year, it's $24.

00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:06,058
So, start us ‐‐ start me
from the beginning.
Okay.

00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:08,160
I download the app.
So, right now,

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,396
we only have, um,
a minimum viable product.

00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:12,398
We did our soft launch
about 60 days ago.

00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:15,301
We have an iOS app, um,
the web app is almost completed,

00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:17,169

to get market share?

What's ‐‐ What's special about
Bundil that is going to

00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:25,411
take away share from the wallets
that already exist?

00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:29,148
So, the "set it and forget it"
mentality

00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,684
is very popular
among micro‐investment users.

00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:33,586
There are a few competitors
in the space that have done

00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:36,455
really, really well with the
micro‐investment technology.

I'm in the
financial‐services industry.

00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,260
I also have apps that do
the same thing this does.

00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,462
Not crypto, but I do
fractional‐share ownership

00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:46,265
in an app called Beanstox.
Mm‐hmm.

00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:47,500
Here's what we learned
about the space.

00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,536
Most apps fail within 36 months
over 80%

00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:53,339
because they're never
able to get the customer
acquisition cost

00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:54,507
below the lifetime value.

00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:55,608
How are you gonna
get customers?

00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:58,311
Um, so, we can actually
advertise on Facebook.

00:17:58,311 --> 00:18:00,346
That is one big thing.

00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:03,082
That's a very expensive way
to acquire a customer.

00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,216
Yes.

00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:07,353
Far better would be a viral
approach, a blog approach,

00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:11,223
an influencer approach, and
all of the above simultaneously.

00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:13,326
It's really, really hard.

acquisition costs
