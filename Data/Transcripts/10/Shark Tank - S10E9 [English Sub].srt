00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,331
Daymond, you want
to do this one?

00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:20,400
Lenz: Yeah. Come on over here.
Wrap around your waist there.

00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,768
‐Okay.
‐Oh, it's full‐on.

00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:22,902
Yeah.

00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,038
I'm a lot thinner
than Daymond's should be.

00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:26,472
[ Laughs ]

00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,641
Okay, both of you, here we go.
Out at the end. Ready?

00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,610
We're gonna do it
like a real class.
We run intervals.

00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,878
Let's start running now.
Jog out.

00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:33,546
‐Hold these, or...?
‐No, you can, but go ahead.

00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,081
‐Keep the chest up.
‐10 seconds! Let's go!

00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:36,516
Chest up. Chest up. Chest up.
‐10, 9...

00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:40,186
Going in 5, 4, 3,

00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:41,754
...2, 1.
‐There you go. Knees up.

00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:42,989
‐Stop. Stop.
‐It's not moving.

00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,057
‐There you go. Yeah.
‐No.

00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:45,158
It's not a treadmill.

00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,192
Lenz: Don't ‐‐ Don't kick
the heels back.

00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:47,193
Knees forward.
Whoa!

00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:48,528
[ Laughs ] You're moving.
Whoa!

00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:50,730
‐So, we want you ‐‐
‐I'm basically running in spot?

00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:51,798
Toback:
Well, think about it.

00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:52,965
When you're running
on a treadmill,

00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:54,233
you're not moving
anywhere, either.

00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,002
This is the same thing.
All right, turn around.

00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,371
Inside the belt, we're gonna
show you some versatility.

00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:00,406
Okay, now we're
doing squat rows.
Okay, now, grab this.

00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:01,774
‐So ‐‐
‐Will it hold me?

00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:03,810
Yeah.
This holds up to 3,000 pounds.

00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,178
You cannot pull out of it.

00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,946
We got NFL guys,
NBA guys on this.
What am I doing?

00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:08,281
You're gonna come
down into that squat.
We're gonna have you do a squat.

00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:09,749
And then come
all the way back up and row.

00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:11,084
And then pull. Yeah.

00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:12,452
Cuban: Don't rip your pants,
Daymond.

00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:13,619
Go ahead. Do it again.

00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,855
‐Wow.
‐Pull. Yeah.

00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,557
You know,
I really feel that.

00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:20,560
We're doing intervals of cardio,
strength, and power.

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,528
We're changing every 30 seconds,

00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,930
which is called tabata style,

00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,666
the most effective way
to get your heart rate up.

00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:30,136
We are running classes
with 60 intervals in 30 minutes.

00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:31,504
‐Thank you.
‐10‐minute warm‐up,

00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:32,739
5‐minute cool‐down.

00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:35,108
So, in 45 minutes, you can burn
up to 1,000 calories.

00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:38,344
It seems like they'd
be exhausted, though,
in 45 minutes, right?

00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,179
Herjavec:
I got to tell you, you ‐‐

00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,180
I thought it was
a bit of a joke.

00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,682
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:44,751
But it's ‐‐
it's a great workout.

00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:46,219
‐It's a real workout, yes.
‐We get that a ‐‐ We get that.

00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,155
Why couldn't I simply
buy the mat

00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:52,392
without all the rest of the ‐‐
which must be very expensive,

00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,194
and just put it in my facility

00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:57,330
with the two belts
that already exist?

00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,199
Why not just sell the ‐‐
What's it called, the Sproing?

00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,335
Why ‐‐ Like,
I don't even get this.

00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:03,736
Because once you
go down that path,

00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,738
you automatically get
to the end where we did, right?

00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,473
You start with,
"Let's just put a mat down."

00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,008
Well, you need
a rear tether system.

00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,110
And I ‐‐ I ran into a guy once.
He said the same thing to me.

00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,212
He said, "I'm gonna
put a mat in my yard."
I said, "Okay. Try it."

00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:15,181
He goes, "Yeah, but then I need
to know how fast I'm going, so,"

00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:16,883
he goes, "I need a footfall
sensor to figure it out."

00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:18,084
He goes,
"Then I need a count."

00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,385
I go, "Great. You're gonna end
right where we are."

00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:20,787
‐How much does this cost?
‐You need the whole machine.

00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:22,355
If I want to buy one for my gym,
how much?

00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:23,356
$6,499.

00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:24,357
‐Oh, my...
‐Whew!

00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:25,792
It is right
in the sweet spot.

00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:28,294
Commercial treadmills run
anywhere between $3,000 ‐‐

00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:29,996
So, it's a high‐end
treadmill, very.

00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:32,365
No. I used to be the CEO
of Bally Total Fitness.

00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:35,835
Nice.
So we have depth
in this industry.

00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:38,237
We have knowledge.
You do not see this anywhere.

00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:41,340
So, can ‐‐ can we ask
Daymond and Robert ‐‐

00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,644
how did you feel just running in
place? What did you think?

00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:47,580
Well, it's like running in sand,
and it's really hard.

00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,283
Like, it gets harder and harder
as you do it.

00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,851
It ‐‐ It's a great
workout, Paul.

00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:53,186
Thank you.

00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:55,955
My challenge I was having there
is, on a treadmill,

00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,590
you take it up,
you take it down.

00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,659
You turn on the TV on there,

00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:01,461
and you watch it
if you're walking in place

00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:02,528
or doing other things.

00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:03,896
This is for intense.

00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,131
‐Yeah.
‐This is like ‐‐

00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,566
Yeah, Paul, that's
my problem with it.

00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:08,434
I'm not gonna do this
for 45 minutes.

00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,336
Here's the focus
we have right now.
Okay.

00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,772
We are opening studios,
high‐intensity ‐‐

00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:14,040
Sorry. So, let's ‐‐
let's stop right there.

00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,909
Sure.
You came out here
selling the machine,

00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,911
but you're actually
selling studios now.

00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:21,714
When I left Bally, I wanted
to invent a brand‐new machine.

00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:24,183
There's only been five pieces
of cardio equipment

00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,718
ever invented ‐‐

00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:30,223
treadmill, elliptical, stepper,
bike, rower. That's it.

00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:32,124
But how did you go
from this to a studio?

00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:34,026
So, we went out,
and we started to
sell equipment.

00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,228
How much of it
did you sell?

00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:36,796
We sold about $1 million
worth of equipment.

00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:38,197
That was in
a two‐year period.

00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:39,866
We were meeting more resistance
than we thought, right?

00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:41,200
This story has a ‐‐

00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,401
Yeah, you're meeting
guys like me

00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:43,936
that are very skeptical
about this.

00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,938
Steve was the former head
of engineering at Life Fitness.

00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,940
Yes.
He has more
treadmill patents,

00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,008
more elliptical patents,

00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,743
than any human being
on this planet.

00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:52,211
And I was the biggest
buyer of treadmills.

00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:53,880
So, what was the roadblock?

00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,582
The treadmill manufacturers
have no incentive to innovate.

00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:57,950
Here's what the health‐club
owners said ‐‐

00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,352
"Eh, nobody's asked me
for this yet."

00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,786
So, then who bought it?

00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:03,923
We got ‐‐ We got some traction
in, uh, rehab centers.

00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:06,826
We got some traction
in private training studios.

00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:07,860
And we said, "You know what?

00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,161
The uptake isn't
as fast as we'd like."

00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:10,596
And all we kept saying
to ourselves was,

00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,131
"Look, if we were still
running our company,

00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:13,499
this is an amazing product

00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,001
that would give us
a competitive edge.

00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:16,335
We would replace
treadmills with this."

00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:17,637
Got it. So, you said,
"We're gonna open up studios."

00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:18,771
"We're gonna
open up studios."

00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:19,939
How many studios
have you opened?

00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,440
We've got four open
right now, in Chicago ‐‐

00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,575
O'Leary: Only with these
machines in them?

00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:23,643
‐Yes, sir.
‐Yes.

00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:25,611
Are you making any money
in those studios?

00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:29,248
The first full year
that we ran our Chicago club,

00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:31,651
we had $400,000
worth of sales.

00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,219
How much have you
invested in this,

00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,887
and how much outside money
have you also brought in?

00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,289
Yeah, 'cause that's
a complicated ‐‐

00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:37,823
So, we've got about $2 million
of our own money into this.

00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:38,824
Wow!
Wow!
Wow!

00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,092
‐You're all‐in.
‐Your own money?

00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,661
‐Our own money. Our own money.
‐We are all‐in.

00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:42,695
‐Here's the problem.
‐Uh‐huh.

00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:43,863
When I go to SoulCycle,

00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:44,964
it's fun, it's intense,
it's motivating.

00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:46,899
‐Right.
‐This isn't fun.

00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,000
Okay, all due respect,

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,869
this is SoulCycle with running.
Here's wh‐‐

00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:51,604
‐But how?!
‐So, that's what the class is.

00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:54,774
It's a 45‐minute class.
There's 25 machines.

00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:57,143
What we didn't get here
is the lights come down,

00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:58,511
the music goes up,

00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:00,513
the instructor's standing
in front of you ‐‐ "Let's go."

00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:02,081
I sense your passion,
and that's great, okay?

00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,416
Yeah.

00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,618
I actually look at this
and say to myself,

00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:06,953
"It's a dog."

00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:08,955
You got to take it
behind the barn and shoot it.

00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:11,057
‐[ Laughs ]
‐I was waiting for that.

00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:12,925
‐It's a fact.
‐It's not a fact.

00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,962
You stand in those clubs,
and you watch the hundreds
and then thousands of people

00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:17,063
who've come through.
‐Oh, okay.

00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:18,564
Cuban: Look, guys,
I would take this class.

00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:19,899
When I go to Chicago,
I'll check it out.

00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:20,900
‐It's great.
‐Good.

00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,134
The challenge
for all of these,

00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,937
they go like this,
and then everybody gets bored,

00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,405
and then they move
to the next thing,

00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,474
you know, just like
SoulCycle had its moment,

00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,176
Barry's Bootcamp...
‐Right.

00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:31,377
‐...Rise Nation, right?
‐Right.

00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:32,745
Some of them stay longer,

00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:34,447
but the bigger part
of the problem is,

00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,449
because you're so
equipment‐driven,

00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:37,617
it's gonna be harder for you

00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:40,019
to adapt and change
in the future

00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:42,355
as people's
expectations change,

00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:43,623
and for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,291
Okay. Mark,
I appreciate that,

00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,226
and thank you
for hearing our story.

00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:48,294
I would just say this.

00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,129
We have had amazing results,

00:37:54,339 --> 00:37:55,940
There's no solution
for quick carrying.

So, Tammy, you ‐‐ Tammy ‐‐
Cuban: No, this
would have been great.

00:37:57,175 --> 00:37:58,576
When my kids were young,
this would have been amazing.

00:37:58,576 --> 00:37:59,744
Tammy, you have two offers.

00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:01,713
I'm offering you exactly
what you asked for, right?

Thank you, and I ‐‐
I would love to ask you

00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:05,083
if I could listen
to all the other offers

00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:07,285
because I think you want a
partner that is not impulsive,

00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,888

I want a partner who's decisive,
and I asked ‐‐

I offered you

And, Tammy, I'll ‐‐
I'll simplify it. Look.

00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:15,927
There's three industries
that I avoid like the plague ‐‐

00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:17,495
the music industry,
pet industry...

00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:19,898
It sounds like
he's about to drop out.

00:38:19,898 --> 00:38:21,499
...and the kids industry.

00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:24,102
And so for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:25,804
Okay.

00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,772
Well, you have two offers.
Lori, what are you doing?

00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:29,374
Lori, I would love
to hear your thoughts.

00:38:29,374 --> 00:38:30,608
Greiner: Um, well,
let me tell you.

00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:32,443
I think your product's
really clever.

00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:34,913
My only concern is,
we don't know yet

00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:38,683
what the consumer's gonna say
or feel when they get it home.

00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:41,019
And so for those reasons,

00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:42,921
it's just too early for me
as an investor.

00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:44,589
Oh, Lori. I‐I hope
that you know ‐‐

00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:46,691
So, I've had it t‐‐
a lot of people wear it.

00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:47,992
Everybody loves it,
and it exists ‐‐

00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,961

25 people testing it.

The final prototype.

00:38:51,229 --> 00:38:53,531
I've had hundreds test
all the way along the way.

00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:56,768
Tammy, Sharks want to feel
like we're adding value

00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,336
and we're being valued.

00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,439
I already told you that you
were risking us dropping out.

00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:04,409
I'm gonna adjust my offer
to $200,000 for 15%.

00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:07,345
I'm gonna match
Kevin's offer.

00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,613
Lori, did you drop out?

00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:09,747

What are you doing?

Well, I‐I was saying
that my concern

00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,589
is what the consumer's going
to say once they get it home.

00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:19,023
I'd be willing to get a rush
order up, you know, fly it in...

not to screw up these
offers right here.
