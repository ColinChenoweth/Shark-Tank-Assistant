you buy a bag

even put it as "kind"?

You know why
I put it on "kind"?

00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:38,985

Cassidy's mom.

Hawaii.

Sharks, I love to create

When I was 7 years old,
my baby sister, Emily,

00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:21,901
would always play
with her spoon.
Aww!

00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,002
And my mom would always
get worried

00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:25,971
that she might accidentally
poke or stab her throat.

00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:28,040
So I wanted to create a product
that eliminated

00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,943
that long and sharp design
of a traditional spoon.

00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:33,779

The Baby Toon
is a combination

of a baby spoon
and a teether all in one.

00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,887

The Baby Toon is made
of 100% soft silicone.

00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:50,195
There are no sharp edges,
so it's gentle on babies' gums,

00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:52,298
and it works great
for teething.

Hello, Sharks.
My name is John Sorial.

00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,371
I'm from Washington, D. C.

00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:08,473

a $300,000 investment

00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,642
in exchange for 10% equity
in my product.

00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,545
Sharks, being the son
of Egyptian immigrants,

00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:16,548
I loved the East Mediterranean
foods I grew up on.

The problem is, my grandmother
didn't ship nationwide.

00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:22,587
So I took authentic recipes
from the motherland

00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:25,090

Thank you so much.

That has been sitting on the

So I don't know

My parents are immigrants.
They actually left Egypt.

00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,443
There was some religious
persecution that was happening.

00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:25,544
They came to America.

00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:27,746
And when you're the son
of immigrant parents,

00:32:27,746 --> 00:32:29,748
they're really liberal
and open‐minded,

00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:32,617
as long as you take
a profession in medicine,

engineering, law,

00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:38,256

I worked in oil refining.

a really hollow experience.

‐I couldn't make product.

four people on the floor.

00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:00,872
This takes dozens of people,
right?
Wow.

00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:04,009
So, I would stay all night
with the staff.

00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:06,912
I would suit up, and I was
shoveling chickpeas myself.

flying all over the country

new co‐packers.

I'm out.

So, how much
have you invested,

00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:52,057
and have you taken in
any outside investors?

00:34:52,057 --> 00:34:54,593
So, we've only ever done
a friends and family round.

00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,027
The total round was $300,000.

00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:59,331
How much equity did you have to
give up for the $300,000?

00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:00,498
I gave away 75%.

00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,867
‐You own 25%?
‐Yes.

00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:06,705
You gave up 75?
Sorry ‐‐ you gave up 75%
at the beginning?

00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:08,974
Okay, so, that's a lot,
and that has a lot of
implications, right?

00:35:08,974 --> 00:35:13,678
Sure. Originally, it was 50%,
right, to the investors.

00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:15,947
And I had the other 50%.

00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,749
So, then,
what we ended up doing was,

00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:18,950
the other investors
were like,

00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,952
"No, we want to be
part of the giving," okay?

00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,922
So we then distributed that 25%
that was reserved

00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:27,025
for the social causes, and we
distributed amongst all of us.

00:35:27,025 --> 00:35:28,893
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
That doesn't make sense.
Sorry. Hang on.

Daniel, I'm betting,
in the journey of Kind,

00:37:09,928 --> 00:37:12,797
you faced this problem
somewhere along the road.

00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:18,703
Kind,
when it was born...

00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:19,838
Yeah?

00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:21,873
...we were in a situation
not very dissimilar to yours.

00:37:21,873 --> 00:37:23,942
Right.
I'd lost
about $1 million in sales

00:37:23,942 --> 00:37:26,211
because one of our manufacturers
had changed the ingredients.

00:37:26,211 --> 00:37:29,748
And we were this far away
from just closing everything.

00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:30,815
Yeah.

00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:32,884
And it's fascinating to me
when I think back

00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:35,887
that Kind grew out of the one of
the toughest years of my life,

00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:38,790
and out of that darkness
came incredible light,

00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:41,092
and Kind today sells
in 300,000 stores,

00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,862
over $1 billion a year
in retail.

00:37:43,862 --> 00:37:45,130
