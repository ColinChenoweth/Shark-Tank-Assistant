00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,842
O'Leary: I'm not worried.
I'm not worried.

00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:37,543
Greiner: Robert,
are you breathing?

00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,613
[ Laughter ]

00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:41,581
[ Laughing ] It's cold!

00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:42,715
[ Laughter ]

00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,850
‐How are your hands?
‐It's cold!

00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,552
[ Laughter ]
Are you okay?

00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,756
[ Laughter ]

00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,858
Oh, that's good.

00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:52,859
Oh, God.

00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:53,926
So, Dale,
who is my market?

00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:55,828
Am I trying to sell
to the people

00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:57,196
that are working
in extreme temperatures?

00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,798
I mean, there's not
too many places on Earth

00:14:58,798 --> 00:14:59,832
that are 200 below zero.

00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:00,833
Right.
Okay.

00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:01,701
How did it feel?

00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:02,902
It ‐‐ It's freezing.

00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,937
Like, my toes are ‐‐

00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,873
Really?
They feel like they're gonna
fall off, seriously.

00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:09,142
Really?
But really incredible ‐‐

00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:11,611
the top, nothing.
The top was good.

00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:12,278
Wow.

00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:16,015
So, we have a proprietary
disruptive insulation technology

00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:17,083
that is amazing.

00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,217
In all of these products?

00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,953
All of these products
contain our insulation.

00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,121
Well, let's define
our market.

00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,689
‐Yes.
‐Who are we going after?

00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,057
Okay, so, why am I here?

00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,193
Because I need
an influencer with power,

00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:28,995
and I need
your distribution channels.

00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:30,096
So, what have you sold?

00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:33,099
So, we have historically sold
$3.5 million

00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,802
company to‐date since 2012.
Wow.

00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:37,003
Seven years?

00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:38,070
You've been doing this
since ‐‐

00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,739
So, what did you do
the last 12 months?

00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:43,109
Uh, well, 2018,
we did $407,000.

00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,944
The issue is, we had
all this great growth,

00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,979
built a reputation,
and oil, if you'll remember,

00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:50,249
went from $80 to $100
to $140 and then, boom, bust,

00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,784
down to $30‐something
a barrel.

00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,418
That was
your primary market?

00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,120
You're trying to sell
to the industrial client?

00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,789
Yes. See, the problem is,
we have so much opportunity.

00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:57,356
We could be everywhere.

00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,125
So, we were trying
to be focused on oil.

00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,327
Well, what that did is, it made
it so we couldn't stay alive.

00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:04,096
But you want to go
into full retail now?
What do you want to do?

00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,198
Greiner: Well,
but wait a minute.

00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:07,033
How are you different
from your competitors?

00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:09,836
So, the value proposition
is that we do

00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:11,037
the three things we claim ‐‐

00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:13,172
one, you can be
soaking wet and warm.

00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:15,107
But does it breathe?
Does it let in ‐‐
So, let's say
you fall into...

00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:18,110
Why is it solved for wet?
You're ice fishing,
and you fall in.

00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,946
Like, it's
freezing‐cold water.

00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:21,247
Yes.
What happens?

00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,683
So, I have a video
to demonstrate that.

00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:24,884
Oh.
This is me.

00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:26,085
I'm wearing
our Fortress layer

00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:27,353
and then just
some basic underwear.

00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,222
‐Oh, my gosh!
‐You're not gonna do that.

00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:32,158
‐Don't do it!
‐This is 3 1/2 feet of ice,

00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,026
and it really sucks.
‐No!

00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,928
‐Ohh!
‐Oh, my gosh!

00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,196
Lewis: This is so horrible.

00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,931
You'll see by my face it is...
Ohh!
Ohh.

00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,933
‐It's so dangerous.
‐Ugh!

00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:41,968
You cannot breathe.

00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:43,102
But that's <i>in</i> the water.

00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,904
Once you get
out of the water,

00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:47,173
within 45 seconds,
you are absolutely warm.

00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,307
I am curious about you,
though.

00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:50,109
Are you a scientist?
What's your background?

00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,878
No, no, no.
So, you'll love this.

00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:53,112
I'm a serial entrepreneur,

00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,047
had three colossal failures,

00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,583
seven years of famine.

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,922
[ Voice breaking ]
You, uh...

00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:04,156
Excuse me.

00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:06,292
Where you're so poor,
it affects your self‐esteem.

00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,494
Like, I'm serious.
We have eight children,

00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:12,064
and, um, I was trying to hook up
this new business,

00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:14,500
and each time ‐‐

00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,103
My kids bet me how long
it would be before I cried.

00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:18,271
Aww.
O'Leary:
The bad times are gone.

00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:20,706
[ Laughs ]
You have eight kids,
Dale?

00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:21,207
Yeah.

00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:24,143
That would make me cry, too.
[ Chuckles ]

00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:25,378
Anyway. [ Clears throat ]
Excuse me.

00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,247
The fourth one
was this awesome success.

00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,182
Excuse me. [ Sighs ]
Okay, and...

00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:33,052
So, you blow up three times,
and the fourth is magic.

00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,220
Blow up three times,
the fourth one was magic.

00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,254
So, now the fun part.

00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,089
I built
a telecommunications company

00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:40,059
from zero to $33 million
over nine years.

00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,260
I'm assuming
you sold this.

00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,196
And then I had a liquidity event
and retired when I was 40.

00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:45,464
And ‐‐ Thank you.

00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,433
It's the American dream.
It really is.
Yes, it is.

00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,068
O'Leary: What's missing
in this deal is,

00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,436
it's undefined
where I go next.

00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,171
I don't know
where to go with this thing.

00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:54,040
I give you my $600,000,

00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,241
and I don't know
how I get it back,

00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,944
'cause I'm only getting
15% of the company,

00:17:57,944 --> 00:17:59,145
and you haven't really decided

00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:00,379
what you're gonna do.
‐No, no, no.

00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,481
If you're going
after the fashion space,

00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:05,251
then you're competing
with all these mega marketers.
Right.

00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,053
‐Yep.
‐That's very hard.

00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:08,421
But you haven't done
any of that stuff.

00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,423
You're selling direct
to guys in the oil field.

00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:13,092
So, that's where I think
I'm coming to you

00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,227
and saying I'm looking
for the low‐hanging fruit.

00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:18,230
You are influencers, and
you have distribution channels.

00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,398
You don't have
a market to find.

00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:21,200
No, right now,
we're gonna continue

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,203
to do the industrial workwear
together with the outdoorsmen.

00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,372
Corcoran: Dale, if you had
patented technology,

00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:29,141
did you not think
about selling the technology

00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,043
to people
who manufacture clothing,

00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,111
versus do it yourself?

00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,312
We did, and we were told no,

00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,147
because it was
an unproven technology.

00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,282
They wanted market validation,

00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,084
and that is why
we created Fortress ‐‐

00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:39,085
to go get market validation.

00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:41,187
I see.
O'Leary: Here's a question.

00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:44,991
I like the style
of that...Catwoman thing.

00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:45,524
The base layer.

00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:47,159
That looks interesting.
Greiner: Me too.

00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:48,427
Now,
I ski in St. Moritz.

00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,196
It's the coldest mountain
in Switzerland.

00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:52,264
It's about 28 below
on the top.
Awesome.

00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,967
And I want to look great
when I get down to the <i>cabine.</i>

00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,102
‐[ Chuckles ]
‐Alright?

00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:58,137
If I just wore that,
I'd look great on the mountain,

00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,238
which I care about.
No. No, no, no.

00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,907
Then you'd wear
your outer shell of choice.

00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:03,509
Why can't I just wear this,

00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:05,378
what you're wearing,
to go skiing?
Greiner: With nothing, yeah.

00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:08,180
Oh, 'cause it doesn't have
a wind‐stop.

00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,281
It doesn't have
the wind stopper?

00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,417
So, think of this
as insulated thermal underwear.

00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:14,220
Okay.
Normally, you'd just throw
some sort of shell over it.

00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,222
Greiner: Here's what's
confusing for me.

00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:19,525
I think the look is good,
the technology sounds good,

00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:22,261
but I'm still not getting
how this is gonna beat

00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:23,562
what else is out
on the market.

00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:27,166
And the thought
of a shell on top, for me,

00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,301
disconnects to how cool
I think the look is,

00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,137
'cause it takes away from that.

00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:32,938
I don't think
I'm the right partner.

00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:34,073
I'm sorry. I'm out.

00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:36,008
Okay. I think maybe
after a little while,

00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,209
you might come back in.

00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:38,444
So...
[ Laughter ]

00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:40,346
Corcoran: Let me say
a couple of things.
Please.

00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,148
I think
your best positioning

00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:45,251
is that you are
Fortress underwear company.

00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:47,253
Yeah.
You drop on a parka,
you go skiing.

00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:48,521
You drop on a parka,
you go ice fishing.

00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,389
You drop on a parka,
it's just a thin layer.
It's a good idea.

00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,324
And I think also having
all these garments

00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:53,526
is confusing
for a consumer.

00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:57,363
I think it should be one thing
that applies to many industries.

00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:00,032
What's wrong with positioning
as an underwear company?

00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,300
That caught my attention.

00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,268
And we're open to that.

00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:04,470
Well, I'm not open to it.
Oh, okay.

00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,039
Because
it came too late.
That's a good idea, Barb.

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,540
But I...

00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,308
Yeah, but it would be
a whole new business

00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,243
you'd have to build.
You know, Fortress
long underwear, right?

00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:15,081
So, I wish I had the energy
for that and enthusiasm for it.

00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:16,282
But sadly, I am out.

00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:19,685
You know, Dale,
it's missing focus on marketing,

00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:23,989
and I have a very hard time
parting with $600,000

00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:26,392
to test different ideas.

00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,460
I can't go there with you.

00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,895
I don't see a strategy.

00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,497
I'm out.

00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:34,233
Herjavec: Dale, I have to
tell you, I love this,

00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:38,304
but the message,
it's so confusing!

00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:40,539
You're selling
to oil workers.

00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:43,109
Then you're jumping into water
in the Arctic somewhere.

For about 20 years,

themselves.

to let me produce

If you're the only one
and you dominate this market,

00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:19,097
why aren't you selling them
for $15 instead of $11.50?

00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:20,966
Because
the window manufacturers

00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:22,901

00:33:22,901 --> 00:33:25,003

00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,204

to pay a premium.

just do the manufacturing

I'm disconnecting, right?

00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,122

a better‐quality product

looks better?

Why are they not able to sell it
for a premium?

00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,936

$10 million in sales this year.

00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:14,119
But you're gonna make
$80,000 on it.

No, no, no, that ‐‐ that ‐‐

all the crap you're doing now?

your wheels so hard

So, to answer your question,
absolutely.

We've talked
to the major manufacturers.

And?
But the fact of the matter is,

we had to kind of get out
and make a name for ourselves.

So, you're saying you couldn't
get them to license it from you

in the market first?

very fast followers.

Yes.

You've now got $5 million

through this horrible way
of making no money,

00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:10,041
'cause you're buying it
from yourself, basically,

00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:11,376
and then reselling it
with tiny margins.

So, you can sell
to the public.
Absolutely.

for his window?

They're all custom‐made.

00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,189

some of the things like,

"Oh, you can't
just ship them from,"

But why custom‐made?

Well, but aren't there
standard‐size windows?

Yeah, aren't the windows
all to standard?

00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:42,307
No. The window industry
is very, very custom.

But every customer has
to be custom‐made?

00:35:45,043 --> 00:35:46,277
Mm‐hmm.
Yeah, but I go into Lowe's,

and there's screens
all over the place.

00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:50,315
Greiner: Yeah.
I mean, if
a traditional screen

00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:52,350
doesn't need to be custom‐made,
why do yours?

00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:55,487
They do. Again, if you buy
a window at Lowe's,

00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:58,490

00:41:18,076 --> 00:41:18,609
Really?

00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:19,944
He's a huge hit.

00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:21,879
And he's looking
to do something else.
Guess what, Joe.

00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:23,748
I'd help you get it.
I'll do that same deal.

00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:25,750
You can't get
my brother Marty, Lori.

00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:28,519
[ Laughter ]
No. I can't get Marty.

00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:31,489
I can't get Marty,
but I'll do the same deal.

00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,591
Um, would either one of you
be willing

00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:37,428
to up the cash
versus the line of credit

00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:38,396
to sweeten the pot?

00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:39,430
No.

00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,368
What are you going to do?

00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:49,640
I, uh ‐‐ I do think that you
have the better connections

00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,942
with the hardware space,

00:41:50,942 --> 00:41:53,678
and I've love to partner up
with you on that deal.

00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,279
Ah [bleep]
Whoo!

00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:56,381
I mean, oh, damn it!

00:41:57,648 --> 00:41:58,750
‐Awesome.
‐Wow.

00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,685
Corcoran: Well,
that's not only losing a deal,

00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:03,688
but watching somebody steal
your idea <i>and</i> lose the deal.

00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:05,556
Sorry, Barb.
I'm sorry.

00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:06,557
That's alright...

00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:07,592
Congratulations.
...I guess.

00:42:07,592 --> 00:42:08,726
Thank you, guys.
Good job, Joe.

00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:11,796
It's going to change everything
about our company,

00:42:11,796 --> 00:42:13,998
and partnering with Lori
is gonna be fantastic.

00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:17,468
I'm just so excited,
I can't even contain myself.

00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:18,936
Ooh, Barbara's giving me
the evil stare.

00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:21,639
Lori, it wasn't fair.
You to play dirty,
and I don't like it.

00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:24,342
But I'm a lot prettier than you,
so I'm gonna get over it.
