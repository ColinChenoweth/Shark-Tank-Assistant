00:15:06,943 --> 00:15:08,044
And it's all human‐grade,

00:15:08,044 --> 00:15:10,112
all local and organic
ingredients and natural.

00:15:10,112 --> 00:15:11,347
This is just a seasoning,
right?

00:15:11,347 --> 00:15:14,183
So it goes on top of all
the food that we serve?

00:15:14,183 --> 00:15:16,252
Correct. So, compared to
a lot of toppers,

00:15:16,252 --> 00:15:18,054
if you put
a freeze‐dried topper,

00:15:18,054 --> 00:15:20,923
or meat, for example,
dogs just pick it out.

00:15:20,923 --> 00:15:21,657
They eat around it.

00:15:21,657 --> 00:15:25,061
We always make the joke that,
you know, dogs are like kids ‐‐

00:15:25,061 --> 00:15:26,362
they eat the marshmallows
in cereal

00:15:26,362 --> 00:15:28,197
and leave
everything else.

00:15:28,197 --> 00:15:31,067
What we do
completely coats the food

00:15:31,067 --> 00:15:33,102
so it adds a whole new
flavor profile,

00:15:33,102 --> 00:15:34,370
and you're able to
mix up meals

00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,439
without changing their diet
completely.

00:15:36,439 --> 00:15:38,307
What else is out there
that's comparable?

00:15:38,307 --> 00:15:41,377
Our main competitors are wet
foods that we find, and then,

00:15:41,377 --> 00:15:44,146
as well as freeze‐dried
toppers, meat‐based.

00:15:44,146 --> 00:15:45,448
Well, then let's get into
the numbers. Prove it out.

00:15:45,448 --> 00:15:47,116
Yeah, how long have you
been in business?

00:15:47,116 --> 00:15:48,985
Okay, so, in the first
annual year ‐‐

00:15:48,985 --> 00:15:50,186
We launched a little over
a year ago,

00:15:50,186 --> 00:15:53,990
and in the last annual year,
we've done $105,000 in sales.

00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,391
Initially,
when we launched,

00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,159
we were still producing this
in‐house.

00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:59,328
It's a 350‐square‐foot
headquarters,

00:15:59,328 --> 00:16:02,431
my living facilities,
and our production facilities.

00:16:02,431 --> 00:16:05,167
So, we grew really fast.
We found traction right away.

00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:06,302
We got in my truck

00:16:06,302 --> 00:16:09,238
and drove to every store
and venue in California.

00:16:09,238 --> 00:16:12,441
But we ran into production
issues right away.

00:16:12,441 --> 00:16:15,111
Okay.
And we became
very agile ‐‐

00:16:15,111 --> 00:16:16,278
In other words,
you sold out.

00:16:16,278 --> 00:16:18,948
And we sold out.
You don't
have a copacker yet.

00:16:18,948 --> 00:16:20,082
We don't have a copacker.

00:16:20,082 --> 00:16:21,617
Are you still
in that same apartment?
Yes.

00:16:21,617 --> 00:16:24,387
So, we actually have invested
everything we've made

00:16:24,387 --> 00:16:28,257
back into small equipment,
production equipment.

00:16:28,257 --> 00:16:30,226
But we're not production guys.
We're not manufacturing guys.

00:16:30,226 --> 00:16:31,627
Greiner: Right.
We've done this
out of necessity.

00:16:31,627 --> 00:16:33,529
How much are these selling for,
each unit?
Sure.

00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:37,333
So, on average, about $2.45
is our cost to make them,

00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:40,036
and they sell for $12.99.

00:16:40,036 --> 00:16:41,270
‐Good for you.
‐What?
‐Wow.

00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,638
‐$13?
‐We knew you'd like that.

00:16:42,638 --> 00:16:46,442
Yeah, that was ‐‐ And each
bottle lasts 30 to 60 meals.

00:16:46,442 --> 00:16:48,244
You're not saying a lot.
What do you do in the company?

00:16:48,244 --> 00:16:50,246
I know, because, obviously,
he speaks so well,

00:16:50,246 --> 00:16:51,547
and he knows he's on top
of everything,

00:16:51,547 --> 00:16:53,282
so I just got to kind of
let him go with it.

00:16:53,282 --> 00:16:55,251
What is your background?
Yeah, of course.

00:16:55,251 --> 00:16:58,020
Like any good story, we've been
best friends since second grade,

00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,388
and we met
on the school bus,

00:16:59,388 --> 00:17:03,025
and our friendship has kind of
always revolved around dogs.

00:17:03,025 --> 00:17:04,326
The very first moment
I met him ‐‐

00:17:04,326 --> 00:17:06,295
Sounds so romantic.
I know.

00:17:06,295 --> 00:17:07,363
[ Laughter ]

00:17:07,363 --> 00:17:08,464
‐Oh, Lord.
‐It's not.

00:17:08,464 --> 00:17:10,466
It's not romantic.
Don't worry.

00:17:10,466 --> 00:17:14,236
I was on the school bus,
and my dog at that time, Bailey,

00:17:14,236 --> 00:17:16,338
wasn't doing too well,
and on the way home,

00:17:16,338 --> 00:17:19,341
I just had the sense
that Bailey died.

00:17:19,341 --> 00:17:21,343
And I started crying
on the bus,

00:17:21,343 --> 00:17:23,345
and Brett was sitting
in the seat behind me,

00:17:23,345 --> 00:17:26,115
peeks his head over and asks,
"Why are you crying?"

00:17:26,115 --> 00:17:27,183
We start talking.

00:17:27,183 --> 00:17:29,919
He tells me about his dogs,
Maddy and Buddy,

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,253
and here we are today.

00:17:31,253 --> 00:17:32,988
Okay, so, let's get back
to business.

00:17:32,988 --> 00:17:33,522
Okay.
All right.

00:17:33,522 --> 00:17:35,157
So, the challenge
is capital.

00:17:35,157 --> 00:17:36,492
Every company's gonna
go through that.

00:17:36,492 --> 00:17:39,261
"If I only had more money,
I could reach everybody."

00:17:39,261 --> 00:17:40,629
Right.
But there's a point of
diminishing returns.

00:17:40,629 --> 00:17:43,499
Sure.
So, tell us about
your inventory right now.

00:17:43,499 --> 00:17:46,402
So, right now, we have
about 3,000 bottles,

00:17:46,402 --> 00:17:48,604
and that's about
a month and a half's
supply for us.

00:17:48,604 --> 00:17:52,341
Essentially, we are ordering
when we get the POs.

00:17:52,341 --> 00:17:54,276
O'Leary: Have you gone
and investigated any copackers

00:17:54,276 --> 00:17:56,078
in the spice space,
for example?

00:17:56,078 --> 00:17:57,279
We have, and we know
the minimums

00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:59,782
are gonna be
about 3,000 bottles per SKU.

00:17:59,782 --> 00:18:03,385
Okay.
And we're still narrowing down
the actual price per ‐‐

00:18:03,385 --> 00:18:04,487
Give me a range.

00:18:04,487 --> 00:18:07,490
That would drop our costs
down to close to $2.

00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:08,591
What do you need us for?

00:18:08,591 --> 00:18:11,460
We cannot produce this
ourselves anymore.

00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,562
We need a partner.
So, right now, we pay ‐‐

00:18:13,562 --> 00:18:17,066
37% of our costs are packaging
and labeling,

00:18:17,066 --> 00:18:18,300
which is astronomical

00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,568
because we don't have
any purchasing power.

00:18:19,568 --> 00:18:21,604
Over the last decade
of "Shark Tank,"

00:18:21,604 --> 00:18:26,308
I have seen every crazy
doggy idea and then more.

00:18:26,308 --> 00:18:29,311
And every single one of them
goes through the roof

00:18:29,311 --> 00:18:31,280
when people see ‐‐
It's sick.

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,516
It's so crazy how much money
people spend on dogs.

00:18:33,516 --> 00:18:35,718
So I'm converted, okay?
I get it. I get it.

00:18:35,718 --> 00:18:39,355
I think this idea is nuts,
but I know it's gonna work,

00:18:39,355 --> 00:18:41,357
because I look at dogs
eating kibble saying,

00:18:41,357 --> 00:18:43,192
"That must be
boring as hell."

00:18:43,192 --> 00:18:44,560
And a little pizza,
or whatever it is,

00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,363
it's interesting, but it's
a massive marketing problem.

00:18:47,363 --> 00:18:49,431
I think it's a nightmare.
You guys are just so early.

00:18:49,431 --> 00:18:51,200
Why do you think
it's a marketing problem?

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,535
Because no one knows
about this, and ‐‐

00:18:52,535 --> 00:18:54,470
Exactly ‐‐
that's the beauty of it,

00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:57,139
is so many people know
about so many things.
Yeah, I get it.

00:18:57,139 --> 00:18:58,541
This is new.
It's so early.

00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,209
I'm willing to
make you an offer.

00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:01,610
Here it is.
It reflects the risk.

00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,512
But I don't have a doggy do‐do
in my portfolio right now.

00:19:03,512 --> 00:19:05,514
Says the man who's like,
"This is nuts, and I
don't see it working."

00:19:05,514 --> 00:19:07,383
Kevin always talks up the risks
so he can undercut his offer.

00:19:07,383 --> 00:19:08,551
O'Leary: Of course.
Yeah.

00:19:08,551 --> 00:19:11,287
It's better than nothing.
Do you want to hear it or not?

00:19:11,287 --> 00:19:12,521
So, silence from
the doggy gallery.

00:19:12,521 --> 00:19:13,589
Well, <i>I</i> do, so...

00:19:13,589 --> 00:19:15,558
I am going to make an offer.
Here it is.

00:19:15,558 --> 00:19:17,526
I'm gonna give you
the $100,000,

00:19:17,526 --> 00:19:20,296
but commensurate with
how early‐stage you are

00:19:20,296 --> 00:19:21,297
and the nightmare of ‐‐

00:19:21,297 --> 00:19:22,398
I bet he's gonna ask
for a royalty.

00:19:22,398 --> 00:19:24,333
Silence, please.
[ Laughs ]

00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,501
I want 50%.

00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:27,403
‐Oh!
‐[ Laughing ] Ohh!

00:19:27,403 --> 00:19:28,637
That's worse!
Kevin!

00:19:28,637 --> 00:19:30,639
That's worse.
Lots of noise.
I hear lots of noise.

00:19:30,639 --> 00:19:32,474
I don't hear any offers.
I hear noise.
Greiner:
You're gonna get what?

00:19:32,474 --> 00:19:35,411
I hear ‐‐ I hear
doggies barking.

00:19:35,411 --> 00:19:37,213
What is that?
Doggies barking.

00:19:37,213 --> 00:19:40,149
I want 50%.
What do you say?

00:19:40,149 --> 00:19:41,350
Uh...

00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,384
[ Laughter ]

00:19:42,384 --> 00:19:44,286
I'm gonna have to
feel out the room

00:19:44,286 --> 00:19:45,454
and see if there are
some other offers.

00:19:45,454 --> 00:19:46,555
O'Leary: You know,
you really should,

00:19:46,555 --> 00:19:47,690
because if you don't get
anything else,

00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,725
all roads go back to
Mr. Wonderful, as usual.

00:19:49,725 --> 00:19:51,594
Maybe I can help you
with a decision.

00:19:51,594 --> 00:19:53,562
You know, I think
it's a genius idea,

00:19:53,562 --> 00:19:56,599
but I think that this is
a speed‐to‐market thing

00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:58,400
that you have to do,
and I think that,

00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,802
honestly, a lot of
the big boys and girls,

00:19:59,802 --> 00:20:03,572
they're going to start putting
a lot of these offerings in,

00:20:03,572 --> 00:20:07,176
and it's gonna be
a challenge to fight that.

00:20:07,176 --> 00:20:07,810
And so I'm out.

00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,479
Maiolfi: And to speak to that ‐‐
Thank you, Daymond.

00:20:10,479 --> 00:20:13,215
But as far as
dog food companies,

00:20:13,215 --> 00:20:14,316
we were in that industry.

00:20:14,316 --> 00:20:15,851
We speak with
a lot of the big boys.

00:20:15,851 --> 00:20:20,256
They won't touch any toppers or
enhancers with a 10‐foot pole.

00:20:20,256 --> 00:20:21,390
They don't want to touch it

00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,525
because what does that say
about their dog food?

00:20:23,525 --> 00:20:25,394
Yeah, this isn't something
you want to release

00:20:25,394 --> 00:20:27,296
with a dog food
manufacturer.

00:20:27,296 --> 00:20:28,330
‐Yeah.
‐Right?

00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:29,465
Sounds like
your biggest inhibitor

00:20:29,465 --> 00:20:30,733
has just been
your ability to make it.

00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:33,836
Right.
You have more demand than
you can fulfill right now.

00:20:33,836 --> 00:20:36,505
Right.
Sharapova: I'm gonna
go ahead and say it.

00:20:36,505 --> 00:20:39,275
I love your brand.
I love your marketing.

00:20:39,275 --> 00:20:41,343
I love the category
that you're in.

00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,411
There's a lot of opportunity,

00:20:42,411 --> 00:20:44,480
but I also feel
that it's very crowded,

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,715
and this is very niche.

00:20:46,715 --> 00:20:49,485
This is, like,
a second‐step process.

00:20:49,485 --> 00:20:51,720
So, to feel like I have to
get another something

00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,157
to put on the food that
I already put on the plate

00:20:55,157 --> 00:20:56,358
just seems like a lot,

00:20:56,358 --> 00:20:58,260
and for that reason,
I'm out.

00:20:59,561 --> 00:21:02,197
So, I think this is
really interesting,

00:21:02,197 --> 00:21:02,831
'cause I do know people

00:21:02,831 --> 00:21:05,434
that have dogs that are
very, very picky.

00:21:05,434 --> 00:21:06,468
I don't know for sure ‐‐

00:21:06,468 --> 00:21:07,703
I haven't been able
to test this ‐‐

00:21:07,703 --> 00:21:09,738
but I think
people love their dogs,

00:21:09,738 --> 00:21:11,607
and I think they would
like their dogs

00:21:11,607 --> 00:21:13,742
to have
a more fun life experience.

00:21:13,742 --> 00:21:15,811
So why not
make your dog's food better?

00:21:15,811 --> 00:21:20,082
Maybe you could make cat food
better, too, right?

00:21:20,082 --> 00:21:20,816
Rabbit food?

00:21:20,816 --> 00:21:24,720
I mean, if it works, it could
become a line of something.

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,356
So I like
everything about it.

00:21:27,356 --> 00:21:30,893
So, I'm gonna give you
the $100,000.

00:21:30,893 --> 00:21:35,497
You have a lot of margin
here in your product, okay?

00:21:35,497 --> 00:21:39,368
I'm gonna ask
for $1 per unit

00:21:39,368 --> 00:21:43,372
until I get

Wild Earth has been
a great success

00:22:19,508 --> 00:22:21,977
because dog owners really care
about their pet health,

to do it the right way.

I think this would be
a great combination.

I'm not asking for a royalty,
but I do want equity, right?

this can grow,

the upside is.

Now, in the franchise
business,

you want to get a royalty of 5%
to 7% for every one you sell.

a minimum of 14% pre‐tax.

The person that franchises
from you
