to continue opening
within food courts,

00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,833

tends to come to you

so many people going by?

00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,268
You hit the nail
on the head.

00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,903

is to open up

00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,905

high‐foot‐traffic areas.

00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,574
Are you profitable now?

00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,676
By the end of the year,
we'll probably break even
on the first year.

that I'll at least do ‐‐

00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:08,148

00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:11,518
Is this gonna be expansion
of just you opening locations

00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:12,986
or franchise or both?

00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:15,255
I see us making sure
we build a foundation ‐‐
really solid, right?

00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,724
And yes, we do franchising ‐‐
probably a little bit too early,

00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,760
but that's something
we can always talk about.

00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,194
What's it cost you
to open one?

00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:23,730
So, this one was 350,
but we learned a lot,

00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,432
and when I was looking
at possibly doing,

00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:28,168

would have been, like, 200.

00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:29,503

00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,873

a larger market a mile away,

even known I'm there.

future, right?

spaghetti squash on there,

they do the rest.

00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:39,706
I mean, would you be open to
doing just a CloudKitchen?

00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,842

Absolutely.
Yeah.

00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,844

more of a market going
in other directions.

much lower rent

aren't storefronts.

And you can go to more cities
more often, quicker.

00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,961
Mittens ‐‐ retail, $24.

00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,062
Yeah.

00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:45,231
Cost to make,
including packaging, $4.50.

00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,899
Are you selling this
all direct‐to‐consumer?

00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,101
We've been around
for eight years,

00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,836
so in the beginning,
we were selling to Gen X moms.

00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:51,704
So, we were distributing
at baby boutiques,

00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,106
as well as Amazon,

00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,575
as well as brick‐and‐mortar
and specialty.

00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:57,110
Whereas now,
it's really shifted

00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,278
to a lot more
direct‐to‐consumer.

00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,246
So, total sales?
Year to date.
Year to date.

00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,749
Total sales ‐‐
5.5 ‐‐ $5.2 million.

00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,083
O'Leary: What about this year?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,618
Total sales lifetime?

00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,087
Lifetime. 5.2.
5.2. Okay.

00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,856
John: But one second.
I'm astonished
they're so low.

00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:11,791
So, back in the day,
it was a really heavy
wholesale business.

00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,559
O'Leary: What is this year
gonna be, total sales?

00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,194
2 1/2.
What are you gonna make
on it?

00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:17,330
About 15% profitability.

00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,731
We've been profitable
since year 1.

00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,900
You've put this ‐‐
$1 million for 8%.

00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,269
That imbues
a $12.5 million valuation.

00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,171
That's a little rich.

00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:26,806
That's a <i>lot</i> rich.
It's a little rich.

00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,941
However, we did
our first fundraising round

00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:31,411
back in early 2018.

00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:32,879
We were at $1 million
in sales.

00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:35,948
We had a post money
at $5 million valuation then.

00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,317
Yeah, but you've
only doubled sales.

00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,685
There's a sucker born
every minute.

00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:40,853
I bet those suckers are
scratching their face.

00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:42,221
But we're growing.

00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:43,589
We have
a clear line of sight

00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,358
for $5 million business
next year.

00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,226
Why aren't sales more?

00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,628
It's a wholesale business,
largely.

00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:49,929
That's where we came from.

00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,031
And so, now, I would say,
in the last 18 months or so,

00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,266
we've really got
into direct,

00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,767
and we're seeing
some very, very good numbers.

00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,669
And what percentage
of your sales are direct sales?

00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,038
Oh, direct now?
Probably around 15% to 20%.

00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,373
That's a good start.
Yeah.

00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:01,541
That's the disconnect.

00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,243
You're in distribution.
Why not more?

00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:05,378
I mean,
because how are ‐‐

00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:07,146
Is it your point of sale
not working?

00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:09,515
Is it the display
not working?
No. That's a great question,
Mark.

00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,819
So, therein lies, I think,
a challenge for being small.

00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:14,687
You know, it's like,
they come back and say,

00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,988
"Well, we need
more assortment.

00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:17,724
We need more sizes.
We need more products."

00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:20,727
<i>Every</i> client says that.
They don't mean it.
About everything.

00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:22,662
Yeah. And we get that
a lot.
Greiner: Well,
but if you have orders,

00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:24,530
I'm wondering
if the price point for ‐‐

00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,631
It's really high.

00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:28,735
Because if you have a baby
of that age,

00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:32,271
you probably need at least two,
three, or four pair of each.

00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:33,206
Correct.

00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,875
So, now you're into
over $100

00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,844
just for the booties
and the mittens.

00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:41,514
Where did you do the testing
of this price?

00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:43,683
We did it essentially
just online.
Okay.

00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:45,218
What you see
on the display here

00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,586
is really what's at
brick‐and‐mortar.

00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:47,787
Okay.
That's à la carte.

00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:49,088
Cuban: So, that's
your in‐store display.
Correct.

00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,723
Yeah, so,
that's the problem, right?

00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,025
Because there's
no 1‐inch description.

00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:54,360
There's nothing
that really says

00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,895
"Your kids are
gonna scratch themselves

00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,930
if you don't use this,"
right?
Mm‐hmm.

00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,232
That's the disconnect,

00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,100
and I think
you have to solve that.

00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,902
This hasn't gone
into store yet.

00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,337
This is just a prototype.
Oh, so, what's in the store?

00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:06,939
Just that?
Yeah, so, in store
and baby boutiques,

00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,742
it's our trees,
which can hold 48 units.

00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,344
That's even worse.

00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:13,146
That's even worse, guys.

00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:14,447
We're under‐telling
our story.

No, there's
no story at all.

00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:17,283
You're not telling
a story at all.

00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,852

of how Lily and Linsey

are marketing their high‐end
baby apparel company, Goumi.

we need the money.
That's fixable.
That's absolutely fixable.

asking us to give you
$1 million to fix that.

That's why we're here.
We need help in that department.

00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:46,512
But at a $12.5 million
valuation,

00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,314
we're paying you
to hire us.

Guys, that's not gonna work

00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:53,486
Thank you.

00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:55,021
So, I'm trying
to figure out,

00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:57,190
how are you getting
to that valuation?

00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,358
I'm choking
on the valuation.

00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:02,228
Is it the need
for that amount of capital?

00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:04,363
Is it you just think
you're gonna be that good?

00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,098
'Cause usually,
a business figures itself out

00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,166
in seven years.

00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,235
The valuation largely came
from the fact

00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:11,504
that we were able to raise
that valuation before.

00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:12,772
The other thing is,

00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:15,007
moving from a wholesale
to a direct business ‐‐

00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,175
huge for us.

00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:18,544
We've gotten customer
acquisition numbers

00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:20,746
now down to $16,
sometimes $8.

00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,215
And we're moving ‐‐
historically, it went

00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:24,884
from mitts and boots business
to now much more of a gifting

00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:26,486
and higher‐priced
product business.

00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,221
Those are the two
main reasons.

00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:30,590
You've been in business
for eight years,

00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,692
and you have $5.2 million?

00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:36,028
I have another sock business ‐‐
Grace &amp; Lace ‐‐

00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,697

for five years

and they have $15 million.

00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:40,733
That's a sizable difference.

00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,836
I believe that the problem
you have that <i>they</i> don't have

00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,906
is they have
70% returning customers.

00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:48,708
You're in
the new baby business,

00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,676
so it's very, very expensive
for you

00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,712
to constantly start
and find new customers,

00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:55,381
and I believe that's why
you're only doing 15% online.

00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,783
I think it's gonna be
very, very hard,

00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,685
and I think
it's grossly overpriced.

00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,088
And so, for that reason,
I'm out.
Thanks.

00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:06,058
I will say ‐‐ I think that you
have a great‐quality product.

00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:09,095
It's really quite beautiful.
It's very premium and high‐end.

creating great‐quality product

00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:18,871

at an affordable price

00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,707
so that my products
could be enjoyed by all.

Sorry. I'm out.

A luxury...
Mm‐hmm.

00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,853
...and then solution, and
solution is the most important.

is just...crazy.

a proper valuation

That's about
what it's worth right now.

00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,886
I should be in this space
because I already own

They have babies.

00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,658
And then they send
Lovepop cards to them

00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:15,261
and then they send...
Wicked Good Cupcakes as gifts

00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,462
and all that stuff.

00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:17,797

is a choker.

is I'd say to you,

00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:24,203
okay, look, you're gonna need
money for inventory

00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,771

the retail business.

is what we need.

Absolutely.

was really good.

only 50 calories per serving

Katey Jo, where do you
sell this? <i>How</i> do you sell it?

00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:57,569
So, we sell our products
in 70 grocery chain stores.

00:33:57,569 --> 00:33:59,905
Giant Foods
is our major grocery buyer.

00:33:59,905 --> 00:34:03,008
My husband and I own
a third‐generation family farm,

00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:05,343
and we supply Giant
with our produce.

00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:08,747
How long has this part
of the business been operable?

00:34:08,747 --> 00:34:12,050
So, we established
The Frozen Farmer in 2015.

00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,285
We went
to Ice Cream University.

00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:14,553

Of course.

00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:21,293
So, we learned
the art of making ice cream.

these are really fantastic.

Artisanal.

00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:30,168
So, in 2019, we've already done
$310,000 in sales.

00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:33,939
Our current container average
across the board is $1.75.

00:34:33,939 --> 00:34:35,907
So, that's what it costs you
to make?
Correct.

00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,375
That's high.
And what do you
sell it for?

00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,577
We wholesale for $3.30.

00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:42,714
And they retail for $4.49
to $5.99 on the shelf.

00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:44,716
So, what percentage
of your sales

00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:46,151
are through
the grocery channel?

00:34:46,151 --> 00:34:49,921
So, only 15% of our sales
are actually grocery sales.

00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,857
We did $46,000 in grocery sales
this year.

The rest of our sales
have been wholesale and on‐farm.

But it's really, really,
really hard

00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:06,497
to be in the ice cream business,
as they all were saying.

00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:09,801
But yet you have something that
I think is like Blue Ribbon.

00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,502
I'm just not sure ‐‐

Come on, Lori.

One, I will help you
redo your packaging,

00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,775
alright,
no matter what,

00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:19,777
so that you will have
a great label,

00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:22,447
and I'll help you with the name
and the trademark and that.

00:41:22,447 --> 00:41:24,115
Okay.

00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:26,918
I'm gonna offer you
the $125,000...

the money

00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:37,462
if we can land
a major national chain

00:41:37,462 --> 00:41:38,997
with the product.

Well, it's good
you said that,

00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,667
'cause I've already had talks
with Harris Teeter and Wegmans.

00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:46,337
$125,000 for 30%?

00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,373
I wouldn't think about it
too long, Katey Jo.
Yes. Like a Wegmans ‐‐

00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:51,075
Lori, I will do that deal
with you!

00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:53,478
I'm sorry! I know
I'm supposed to negotiate!

I'm sorry!

Thank you very much.

This has been truly an honor.
Oh, it's heavy!

To wear the crown
is a huge responsibility.

00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:14,799
Getting this deal today means
everything to our business.

00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:17,702
I mean, who would have ever
thought in a million years

00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:20,371
that a farmer's wife
from Bridgeville, Delaware,

00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:23,674
would end up on "Shark Tank"
and getting a deal with Lori?

00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:25,977
And I'm just
so incredibly grateful.
