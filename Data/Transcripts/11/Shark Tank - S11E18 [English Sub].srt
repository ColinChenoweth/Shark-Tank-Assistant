what you want to do

is when you come home

you want to remove
the outer sole.

down firmly on the ground,

and material sourcing,

00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,244
they were about three
to four months into it,

00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,229
‐[ Laughs ]
‐He lied. [ Laughs ]

00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,164
Well, Sharks, I am back.

00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,834
And this time,
I've brought backup.

00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:49,535
[ Laughter ]

00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,405
These guys are the inspiration
behind my new business.

00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:54,807
They also represent
my target market ‐‐

00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,075
actual users.

00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:59,279
And if you look closely,
you might even guess that...

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,180
yes, they're my sons.

00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,650
And they're here
to help me secure a deal

00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:07,020
for my new business,
called PrepWell Academy.

00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,957
PrepWell Academy is an online,
video‐based mentoring program

00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,259
that helps teenagers,
like these guys,

00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,395
and their parents,
like me, navigate

00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:19,332
the confusing and stressful
college‐admissions process.

00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:21,167
And, boy,
could we use the help.

00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,236
Guidance counselors
are overwhelmed,

00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:24,904
schools don't have
the curriculum,

00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,472
parents don't have the time,

00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,107
and students
aren't getting the advice

00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:29,609
when they need it most.

00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:31,678
And that's where
PrepWell Academy comes in.

00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:35,248
Every week, PrepWellers get
a video from me on their phone,

00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:37,583
giving them exact advice,
timely advice

00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,119
to help them know exactly
what to do and when to do it,

00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,121
starting in ninth grade.

00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:45,491
Sharks, this advice that I'm
giving ‐‐ it's not guesswork.

00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,227
As you may recall, I have
cracked the code in getting into

00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,463
some of the world's
most competitive programs.

00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,265
It's my superpower!

00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:54,801
And I share that superpower
with my students every week.

00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:56,836
Today, my job is to ask you

00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,138
to share your superpowers
with <i>me</i>

00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:01,107
by investing
in PrepWell Academy.

00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:04,277
And for that,
I'm seeking $100,000

00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:06,546
for 20% of the business.

00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:08,981
Now, boys, head over,
assume your positions.

00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:10,183
[ Laughter ]

00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,418
And, Sharks,
I would like my sons to help me

00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:15,288
demonstrate exactly
how this program works.

00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:18,224
Kiefer, for instance,
as a freshman,

00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,259
every week,
he's gonna take out his phone,

00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:21,561
and he's gonna get a lesson

00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:24,230
and learn things
like study habits ‐‐

00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,466
in this case,
how to take notes,

00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:28,935
when to take notes,
and how to stay organized.

00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:32,004
Then he'll move into
extracurricular activities ‐‐

00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:34,374
how to think about
afterschool clubs.

00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,109
What about volunteer work?

00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:37,577
What about sports?

00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:40,012
Now, Col and Croix, on
the other hand, as sophomores,

00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,281
they're gonna learn
a different set of lessons ‐‐

00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,817
things like how to avoid
the sophomore slump,

00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,919
why colleges love leaders,

00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:50,123
when to take the S. A. T.
or the A. C. T.

00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:52,725
And these lessons
will continue week after week

00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,694
through junior year
and senior year.

00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:57,797
Now, Dexter ‐‐
he's got a couple years to go

00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:59,599
before he becomes
a PrepWeller,

00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:02,034
and I don't think it's gonna
take much to convince him

00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,137
to follow
in his brothers' footsteps.

00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:06,672
But my job today
is to convince you

00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:09,909
to invest in me
and PrepWell Academy.

00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,377
So, who's got questions?

00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:12,912
John: Why were we so ‐‐

00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,647
We see a lot of people,
of course.

00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:17,216
I do remember that you had
an impressive background.

00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,684
But can you run us through
that again?

00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:21,154
I was a recruited athlete
coming out of high school.

00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:23,423
I played basketball
for Yale University.

00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,658
I was an investment banker
at Goldman Sachs.

00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,226
That's what I remember.
Oh, that's right.

00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:29,262
I was a Navy S. E. A. L. officer
and Navy S. E. A. L. instructor.
Yes.

00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,863
Great. That's right.
Thank you for serving.
Greiner: Wow.

00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:32,365
I have an MBA
from Harvard Business School.

00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:34,534
And you have
one good‐looking family.

00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:36,235
[ Laughs ] Thank you.
He had all that,
and then you had

00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:37,336
a deck of cards, right?
Yeah.

00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,872
Now, let's just ask,
how did that go?

00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,274
I'm glad you asked,
Daymond.

00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:42,775
I kept going, I sold more,

00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,745
and we actually became a pretty
attractive acquisition target,

00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:48,214
and I sold the business
to a company on the East Coast

00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:50,249
who had a fitness brand
that they were building,

00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,084
and FitDeck
was the perfect match.

00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,686
Herjavec: Phil,
how do you make a living?

00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,455
What do you do for a living,
if you don't mind me asking?

00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:56,689
Yeah, I'm a firefighter.

00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,090
‐Oh, you are?
‐You are?

00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,959
I became a firefighter
after 9/11.

00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,360
I've been so for 14 years.

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,462
‐Good for you.
‐Oh, wow.

00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,030
‐Thank you.
‐Oh, my gosh!

00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,998
He's, like, the best.
Black: I never even got to it
last time.

00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:07,700
Phil, how do you make money
with this?

00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,235
It's a subscription service,
Kevin.

00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:11,270
Every month,
they get these videos

00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,039
that help them
along the path.

00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:15,475
Do you have any data that says
the attrition rates on this?
Subscribers?

00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,477
You sign people up at what
customer acquisition costs?

00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,712
Well, first, tell us how
many subscribers you have...
How long do they stay?

00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:22,014
...and how much they pay.
220 subscribers.

00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,483
So,
what do you charge?

00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,251
It's $15 a month
for a subscription.
$15 a month.

00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:26,752
And how long
have you been selling it?

00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,354
A little over two years.
Oh!

00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,256
Why do you bring us
the stuff that doesn't work?!
Phil, Phil, Phil.

00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:32,258
I'm gonna give you
another pass to come back.
Black: It's working, Mark.

00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:33,926
220 subscribers?!

00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:35,027
Phil,
what are your sales?

00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,362
$150,000.

00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,531
Your sales
are $150,000?

00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:39,866
Over two years?

00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:40,967
Over two years, yes.

00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:43,769
How do you get there
with 220 subscribers?

00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:46,038
Well, there's a combination ‐‐
there's subscriber revenue,

00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:48,140
there's my private
client revenue,

00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,209
and then we have
a journal that we sell.

00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:53,179
I'd like to know
how you came up with this idea.

00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,013
Sure.

00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,047
I came up with the idea

00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:56,516
after I sold
the FitDeck business.

00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:57,850
I had a little time
on my hands,

00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,686
and I would see consistently
parents bickering

00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,221
about this
college‐admissions stuff.

00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:05,124
"How did Sally not get into
a school with a 4.9 GPA?"

00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:07,460
"What should Billy do
for extracurriculars?"

00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,362
And I got pulled into
one of these conversations,

00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,497
and I said, "Phil, you got
into Harvard Business School.

00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:12,798
You got into Yale.

00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,834
What does it take to have kids
who are competitive

00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:16,402
for the college‐admissions
process?"

00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:19,071
So I started taking notes,
writing best practices,

00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:22,341
writing lessons learned,
tips, strategies,

00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,910
mind‐set
from the Navy S. E. A. L. s,

00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,311
professionalism
from Goldman Sachs,

00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:26,612
and the list got long.

00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,447
Then I went back to school
to get credentialed

00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:29,782
in college‐admissions
counseling,

00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,350
and I put
these two things together,

00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,818
and I started coaching
and mentoring kids.

00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:34,720
I have to tell you,
sitting here, like,

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,457
I think it all seems
very, very smart.

00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:40,626
I think that there's
just one problem.

00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:44,864
It's hard to get people
to buy into something

00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:47,033
that's that long,
that many months,

00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:48,701
at that price.

00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:51,337
I feel like if it was more
of, like, a crash course

00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:54,640
or a course they bought <i>once,</i>
then they could buy in.

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,275
It's easier.

00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:59,545
You know, you get more,
cheaper price point.

00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:02,682
But to me, I don't relate to it
in this model.

00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:05,017
I wish you the best of luck,
but I'm out.

00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,218
Thank you, Lori.

00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,087
Here's my view ‐‐
I remember you last time.

00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,822
It was unbelievably
impressive.

00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,425
You have a passion,
and it keeps you going ‐‐

00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,759
keeps you going

00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,329
maybe past a point
where you shouldn't.

00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:19,098
Two years
with 220 users ‐‐

00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,500
it's ‐‐ it's not great.

00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,868
I admire the mission,

00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:26,005
and I applaud you for all
the other things you're doing,

00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:27,106
but I'm out.

00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,441
I don't see this business.

00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,642
♪♪

00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:30,977
A lot of people
don't want to adapt.

00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:32,244
They don't want
to change,

00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:34,780
even when they know
what's in their best interests.

00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,817
You're trying to educate
people who may not...

00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:38,818
What?!

00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:41,854
...feel they need
education.

00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:42,955
I'm out.

00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:46,692
You took all the right steps,
but the product itself

00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:49,028
is gonna be really tough
to scale, right?

00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:51,030
Because it has to be
demonstrated

00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,899
and it has to be seen
and it has to be experienced.

00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,568
Then it has to be managed
after the fact

00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:56,969
by having
the parents involved.

00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:00,473
That's so much work
for a $15 subscription.

00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,274
That's why
you have such great challenges.

00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,076
And while 220
is not horrible...

00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,345
Mm‐hmm.
...it's certainly not,
you know,

00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:07,747
knocking any walls down.

00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:09,415
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:10,416
Thank you, Mark.

00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,785
Phil,
220 <i>is</i> horrible.

00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:16,055
And I just want to say,
as I said last time,

00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:18,224
you're a really,
really great guy

00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:21,427
with a really, really bad idea
this time.

00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:22,862
This is horrible.

00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:24,397

for the younger generation.

00:33:06,418 --> 00:33:07,986
But you don't need to golf
to wear this.

00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,055
No, you don't.
But that's my point, right,
'cause this is ‐‐

00:33:10,055 --> 00:33:11,323
They are performance,

00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:13,091
so these are made performance
for on the course.

00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:15,494
They have all the technical
features of any other golf polo.

00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:16,695
But they're
cool‐looking shirts.

00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:18,296
‐Thanks. Yeah.
‐I love golf. It's wonderful.

00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:20,265
I'm good for
the first two hours.

00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:22,801
After that, I'm like,
"I can't believe I'm
out here for five hours."
Yeah.

00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:26,304
There is a lot of stuff
like this in the market.

00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:27,939
There's several companies
in golf

00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,708
that have targeted
the older golfer,

00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:31,042
those that are, say,
40 and up.

00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:33,111
Tell us what your plan is
to gain market share.

00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:34,112
What's the plan?

00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:35,180
To give you guys
some context,

00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,882
I started this company
2 1/2 years ago.

00:33:36,882 --> 00:33:38,016
I walked into a golf store,

00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,784
and I was trying to find
something cool,

00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:41,786
and I was like, "There's
got to be someone out there

00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:43,288
that wants to buy
a shirt like this."

00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:44,856
I have no background
in apparel,

00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,258
no idea
how to make a golf polo,

00:33:46,258 --> 00:33:48,326
so I just started Googling,
"How do I make a golf polo?"

00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:51,263
[ Laughter ]
So, I just started making
as many calls as I can,

00:33:51,263 --> 00:33:52,497
hustling, figuring it out.

00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:54,099
Spent 20,000
of my own dollars.

00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:56,167
In the first year,
I did $72,000.

00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:57,235
‐Wow!
‐Good for you.
‐Good for you.

00:33:57,235 --> 00:34:00,238
The second year,
I sold $412,000.

00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:02,674
$412,000 in sales?
$412,000.

00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:04,743
This year, to date,
I'm at $760,000.

00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:06,444
I should close the year
at $1.2 million.

00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,280
Wow!
And we'll close
at $1.2 million.

00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,648
Hustler, hustler.
I like it.

00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:11,516
So, my sales go like this.
You're all online?

00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:13,351
It's all online
until this last year.

00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:15,353
But just so you have
context of sales,

00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:17,656
when I release these polos,
I have loyal customers that buy

00:34:17,656 --> 00:34:19,190
within the first hour
they come out.

00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,626
And my problem has been
I continually sell out,

00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:23,328
and I'm reinvesting cash flow
into it

00:34:23,328 --> 00:34:24,696
to be able to buy inventory,

00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:25,997
and I keep hitting
that max level.

00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:27,332
So they wait for
your drop date, right?

00:34:27,332 --> 00:34:28,733
Yeah, so, it depends
on the shirts.

00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,302
Generally, I do drops
every two months.

00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:31,937
If it's a superhot seller ‐‐

00:34:31,937 --> 00:34:33,638
like, example, this one
right here is called Wildlife.

00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:35,373
That was just launched
a month ago,

00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:37,342
and it sold so well
within the first hour

00:34:37,342 --> 00:34:39,644
that it's gonna move into
our best sellers category.
That's my favorite.

00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:41,313
How many new designs a year
are you gonna drop?

00:34:41,313 --> 00:34:43,548
Per season,
I do about 30 designs.

00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:45,850
And then, on top of that,
I do limited‐edition runs.

00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,352
Who does the design?

00:34:47,352 --> 00:34:49,754
I started doing them all myself
with graphic designers.

00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,289
Now I've basically
built a team

00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:53,425
of probably 10 or so designers
that I work with.

00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,260
What does it cost
to manufacture,

00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,595
and what do you
sell it for?

00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,563
So, I sell these polos
for $72.

00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:00,398
I started making them
for $40.

00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,267
Now I make them for $25,

00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,336
and my next run
coming from overseas

00:35:04,336 --> 00:35:05,737
is coming in for $17.

00:35:05,737 --> 00:35:07,339
Wow.
And within the next six months,
I should be able

00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:09,240
to get that down
to about $12.
Where do you make them now?
Here?

00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,842
So, right now I've made them
all in L. A.

00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:13,044
Last year,
I started selling wholesale.

00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:16,147
So far this year, we've done
about $150,000 of wholesale.

00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:17,949
By the end of this month,

00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,452
I'll have $300,000
committed for next year.

00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:23,421
Why do you feel that you need
to expand in retail

00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:25,223
if you're doing so well
online?

00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:26,625
Yeah,
I think I want to do that

00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,560
because it's an opportunity
and it helps grow the brand.

00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,462
And each shirt is gonna have
a run of how many?

00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:33,131
For next year, I'll probably be
doing 1,000 to 2,000 per shirt.

00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,499
Okay,
the reason I ask that,

00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,501
as opposed to going
to retail, right...
Yeah.

00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:39,371
...every kid right now,
every Millennial, Gen Z, right,

00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:41,606
you're trained by shoes,
right,

00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:43,875
that the drop date
is <i>the</i> date.
Mm‐hmm.

00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,910
Jordan XXXIV ‐‐
when's it gonna hit, right?

00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,846
Everybody's
waiting in line.

00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:49,247
When you told me
you were doing that,

00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:50,815
I'm like,
"That's brilliant."
Yeah.

00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,284
Because that's
what connects you...
Yeah.

00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:56,254
...to golfers
that are 30 and under.

00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:58,423
Now, the minute you've got
those same lines

00:35:58,423 --> 00:35:59,791
in a retail store...
Yeah.

00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:01,459
...there's nobody
waiting in line.

00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:02,661
They're not gonna
sell out.

00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:03,895
Do you see
the difference there?

00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:05,330
I 100% see the difference.

00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,700
What you've got right now is
this incredible momentum online

00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,636
at full‐margin
cash flow...
You're killing it.

00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:12,671
...on these drops.
Thank you. Yeah.

00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:14,406
And we see ‐‐
you've got to believe us ‐‐

00:36:14,406 --> 00:36:16,408
we see
so many apparel deals...
Totally.

00:36:16,408 --> 00:36:18,543
...where the guys
get buried!

00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:19,844
Been there, done that.

00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,379
It sucks.

00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:23,481
This conversation has gone
a lot about retail.

00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:25,050
I'm only projecting
to keep retail

00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,685
at like 25% or less
of my business.

00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,720
That's not the point.
It's not the percentage, right?

00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,355
It's the relationship
with the buyer.

00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:33,425
If you already paid $72,
you can pay $99, right?

00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:36,428
Yeah.
If you can pay $99,
you can pay $129.

00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:37,996
When those drops
are limited...

00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:39,497
Yeah.

00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:41,966
So, I just want to jump in here
for a minute.
Yeah.

00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:43,334
Your shirts ‐‐
you walked in here,

00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:45,937
and you said the reason
why you did all of this ‐‐

00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:47,639
this is
your niche market ‐‐

00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:50,041
is because everything's boring
out there, right?

00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,044
Yeah. Totally.
So, if that's true,

00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,113
if your competition
is boring,

00:36:55,113 --> 00:36:56,915
anywhere you then put
your shirts

00:36:56,915 --> 00:36:58,349
amidst the sea
of "dull"...
Yeah.

00:36:58,349 --> 00:36:59,718
...you're gonna pop
and stand out.

00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:00,985
100%.
That's a really good point.

00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:02,821
And people are gonna
gravitate to it.
Yeah.

00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:06,257
So you can do it all,
so to speak.

00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:07,325
Yep.

00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:09,928
Anyway, I think that
some of my fellow Sharks

00:37:09,928 --> 00:37:12,464
are more interested
in investing in a golf shirt

00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:13,732
than I am.

00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:17,635
I just don't find that it's
the right investment for me,

00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:19,604
so I'm sorry ‐‐
I'm out.

00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:21,473
Thanks, Lori.
I appreciate that.

00:37:21,473 --> 00:37:22,774
I was looking at this,
saying,

00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:26,344
there is no way in hell
I'd put $300,000 into apparel,

00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:28,213
where there is
so much competition.

00:37:28,213 --> 00:37:29,681
But sales don't lie.

00:37:29,681 --> 00:37:32,083
Here's my offer ‐‐
I'll give you $300,000.

00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,419
I <i>forbid</i> you
to go to retail.

00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:36,421
I don't care
what Lori says.

00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,690
$300,000 for 30%.

00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,859
But zero retail.

00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:42,694
Zero retail
to take that offer?
Do you know why?

00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:45,797
You have to beg to get
that shirt on the drop date ‐‐

00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:48,266
beg like a dog for it.

00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,301
Herjavec: Jason,
I don't see it like that.
Thanks for the offer.

00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:51,936
I think when you're hot,
you got to stay hot.

00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,339
I don't know how this all became
completely about retail.

00:37:54,339 --> 00:37:56,007
No, no.
To me, it's like you said.

00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:57,242
I'm riding the wave.

00:37:57,242 --> 00:37:58,510
And you know what?

00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,978
When the wave crests,
you can always pull back.

00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:02,413
We have a great investment in
a company called Butter Cloth.

00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:04,082
We're all online,
about $3.5 million.

00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:05,917
But I like this

00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:08,553
because it's all about
targeting your customer.

00:38:08,553 --> 00:38:09,587
That's great.

00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:13,158
I'll give you the $300,000
for 25%.

00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:15,393
And you're a smart guy.

00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:17,695
I won't forbid you
to sell more anywhere.

00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:20,331
You'll figure it out, and I
think we can really help you.

00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:22,400
Okay.
Cuban: As much as
I like the concept,

00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,902
retail always scares me.

00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:25,270
Totally.
I will tell you,

00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,038
jack up your prices, bro.

00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:28,406
If you're selling out...
Sell it more. Yeah.

00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:29,908
...you're selling
too cheap.
Yeah.

00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:31,109
I'm excited for you.

00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:33,278
It's just not
a fit for me right now.

00:38:33,278 --> 00:38:34,479
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,014
Appreciate it, Mark.

00:38:36,014 --> 00:38:38,750
Let me tell you something ‐‐
retail is about real estate.

00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,785
They start charging you
for hanging fees.
Yep.

00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:42,821
You have to sell it
at half the price

00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:44,622
that you sold online,
right?

00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:47,258
They pay you
in 30, 60, maybe 90 days.

00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:48,827
They return goods
they don't like.

00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,328
It is horrible.

00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,330
I don't want to put
that pressure on you. I'm out.

00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,933
O'Leary:
So, you have two offers, Jason.

00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:56,034
What do you want to do?

00:38:56,034 --> 00:39:01,873
♪♪

00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:09,981
♪♪

00:39:09,981 --> 00:39:11,616
Narrator:
Three Sharks are out.

00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:15,053
Jason is seeking $300,000
for a 10% stake

00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:18,523
in his modern golf shirt
