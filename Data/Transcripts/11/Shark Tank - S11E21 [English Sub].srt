is close to $120.

00:13:23,107 --> 00:13:24,708

a lot of margin.

high margins, correct?

already sold out

I went to Toshiba.

00:14:06,317 --> 00:14:07,985
Over there, I inherited

00:14:07,985 --> 00:14:11,021
a half‐a‐million‐dollar‐a‐year
retail accessory business.

00:14:11,021 --> 00:14:13,457
Within two years,
I grew that to $20 million.

00:14:13,457 --> 00:14:14,625

what's going on
in the education space,

00:14:27,605 --> 00:14:29,840
and the really
"aha" moment for me

00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,609
came from my mom
and my sister,

00:14:31,609 --> 00:14:35,346
who teach in low‐income
neighborhood schools.

00:14:35,346 --> 00:14:38,349
And what they told me was,
in third grade then,

00:14:38,349 --> 00:14:40,317
you started taking
national standardized tests

00:14:40,317 --> 00:14:41,385
on a computer,

00:14:41,385 --> 00:14:43,954
and some kids
were actually struggling.

00:14:43,954 --> 00:14:45,889
They didn't know where
the keys were on the keyboard.

00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:47,358
And I said,
"This is terrible.

00:14:47,358 --> 00:14:48,859
Just because
you're low‐income,

00:14:48,859 --> 00:14:50,594
you shouldn't be put into
a less class,

00:14:50,594 --> 00:14:52,663

for the rest of your life."

00:14:52,663 --> 00:14:53,964

00:14:53,964 --> 00:14:55,699

an affordable solution

We're actually not even
a hardware company.

00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:23,894
I'll be honest with you.
We're a software company.

00:15:23,894 --> 00:15:26,597
What we do is we build
some customized software.

00:15:26,597 --> 00:15:28,499
So, what customized software
did you build?

00:15:28,499 --> 00:15:30,934
So, on this, we actually
don't have any of
our own software yet.

Yeah.
No. No, no.

00:15:34,471 --> 00:15:35,506
the whole capital play.

Guys, look, you are in

00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,611

difficult space that there is.

00:15:40,611 --> 00:15:43,347

for two of those companies.

Doesn't matter.

00:15:51,255 --> 00:15:53,390
But the reason I didn't go
back to work for another one

00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,426
is they're just building
commoditized products.

00:15:55,426 --> 00:15:58,762
One question I always ask myself
when I part with my capital is

00:15:58,762 --> 00:16:01,732
"How does it come home to Daddy?
How do I get it back?"

00:16:01,732 --> 00:16:03,634

00:16:17,548 --> 00:16:18,682
But I think you need to

00:16:18,682 --> 00:16:20,551
either reduce your costs
significantly

00:16:20,551 --> 00:16:23,454
or raise your prices
at least 100 bucks a pop,

00:16:23,454 --> 00:16:27,191

100,000 to 200,000 units, right?

That's gonna cost a fortune
to do that.

The skin science is what
we always call

kind of the voodoo science.

There's a lot of money
in this space,

00:27:51,174 --> 00:27:54,110
but I haven't seen a lot of
really rigorous studies.
Very little science.

00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,378
Have you ever heard
of PROVEN before?
No.

Zhao: That is exactly
what we're doing.

00:27:56,946 --> 00:27:59,149
Starting with the database,
we then partner

00:27:59,149 --> 00:28:01,117
with the head of dermatology
at Stanford University

00:28:01,117 --> 00:28:03,286
to then actually distill
from the data

00:28:03,286 --> 00:28:06,222
what are things that
he's seen as clinical research.

00:28:06,222 --> 00:28:08,958

you're talking about.

Let's go to sales.

$500,000 for 5% imputes
a $10 million value,

00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,369
so I'm so excited
about your sales.

00:28:19,369 --> 00:28:21,071
They're gonna be great.
‐Sure. [ Laughs ]

00:28:21,071 --> 00:28:24,507
So, we were in our beta trial

00:28:24,507 --> 00:28:26,443
for two months
earlier this year.

00:28:26,443 --> 00:28:28,978
We gained $110,000 in sales.

00:28:28,978 --> 00:28:30,213
Where were you selling?
And from what channel?

00:28:30,213 --> 00:28:32,348
We were selling mostly
through digital channels,

00:28:32,348 --> 00:28:33,850
through Facebook.

How much did you spend

00:28:34,918 --> 00:28:36,252
to get
that $110,000 in sales?

‐Ooh.

And then, four weeks ago,

00:28:43,126 --> 00:28:45,628
we relaunched a new website
with new branding.

00:28:45,628 --> 00:28:46,763
Right.
And this month,

00:28:46,763 --> 00:28:49,866
we're also on track
to do about $65,000.

I'm really working
with this.

That's right,
to use our technology.

have you raised?

Give it to me.

00:30:17,754 --> 00:30:20,890
We're projecting to do
$3 million, the fiscal year.

00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:22,458
Wow.
O'Leary: Your customer
acquisition

00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:23,693
is the cost of sales.

00:30:23,693 --> 00:30:25,728
You make $110,000 in sales,
you spend $90,000.

00:30:25,728 --> 00:30:26,930
It's almost one‐to‐one.

00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,164
So, you don't care about that,

00:30:28,164 --> 00:30:29,566
except you got to raise
more dough.

00:30:29,566 --> 00:30:31,434
Right.
Next year,
on the $3 million...

Um, not yet.

00:30:35,238 --> 00:30:36,539
We'll break even
the year after.
Cuban: So, wait.
So, effectively,

00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:38,107
on your next year's
$3 million,

00:30:38,107 --> 00:30:39,542
you are planning
on spending

00:30:39,542 --> 00:30:42,178
$2 million or so
in advertising, correct?

00:30:42,178 --> 00:30:43,213
That's right.
Okay.

00:30:43,213 --> 00:30:44,948
So you're buying
your sales.

00:30:44,948 --> 00:30:48,518
So, it's one thing to say
"My technology is amazing,"

00:30:48,518 --> 00:30:50,353
but when you do that,

00:30:50,353 --> 00:30:52,722
there should be
customer referrals.

00:30:52,722 --> 00:30:55,291
You're saying, effectively,
that you're not expecting

00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:57,894
anything from your existing
customer base,

00:30:57,894 --> 00:30:59,629
because you're having
to buy all your sales.
That's actually not true.

00:30:59,629 --> 00:31:01,331
It's a business decision
we're making

00:31:01,331 --> 00:31:04,701
to keep on experimenting with
new channels, new methodology.

when it comes to the way
students learn.

Kids have basically grown up
around technology,

00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:52,069

just rely on textbooks

of tutoring,

00:34:58,468 --> 00:35:02,539
ABii is changing the future for
millions of kids everywhere.

00:35:02,539 --> 00:35:03,940
So, tell me, Sharks,

00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:07,310
who's ready to fuse
education and technology

00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,312
to create a whole new world
of learning?

00:35:09,312 --> 00:35:11,348
<i>Wow. Amazing.</i>

00:35:11,348 --> 00:35:13,116
<i>Truly unbelievable.</i>

00:35:13,116 --> 00:35:14,217
Oh, go on.

00:35:14,217 --> 00:35:16,186
But, seriously, Sharks,
who's in?

00:35:16,186 --> 00:35:17,988
Kevin, they made
a doll out of you.

00:35:17,988 --> 00:35:19,823
[ Laughs ]
O'Leary: Well...

00:35:19,823 --> 00:35:21,892
I think she said
ABii was a she.

00:35:21,892 --> 00:35:23,627
She is a she.
Thank you.

00:35:23,627 --> 00:35:25,195
You're welcome.
Very light.

00:35:25,195 --> 00:35:27,497
So, I'd love to show you
how ABii works,

00:35:27,497 --> 00:35:29,332
if you're ready to
see it in action.
Great.
Roll it.

00:35:29,332 --> 00:35:31,034
<i>It's Earl's first day,</i>

00:35:31,034 --> 00:35:33,970
<i>but he's having a super‐hard</i>
<i>time paying attention.</i>

00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:36,506
<i>Mark is sitting at</i>
<i>the back of the class,</i>

00:35:36,506 --> 00:35:38,742
<i>launching spitballs</i>
<i>at Earl's head.</i>

00:35:38,742 --> 00:35:40,977
<i>Luckily,</i>
<i>Earl's new friend, Anne,</i>

00:35:40,977 --> 00:35:43,046
<i>is sitting right behind Earl,</i>

00:35:43,046 --> 00:35:45,615
<i>and she is blocking</i>
<i>a lot of the spitballs.</i>

00:35:45,615 --> 00:35:47,851
<i>If Mark shoots 23 spitballs</i>

00:35:47,851 --> 00:35:52,122
<i>but only 7 actually hit Earl,</i>
<i>how many did Anne block?</i>

00:35:52,122 --> 00:35:53,723
<i>Oh, phooey.</i>

00:35:53,723 --> 00:35:55,258
<i>You missed that one.</i>

00:35:55,258 --> 00:35:56,726
<i>Not to worry.</i>

00:35:56,726 --> 00:35:59,596
<i>We'll do more examples together</i>
<i>in directed practice.</i>

00:35:59,596 --> 00:36:02,499
<i>In the meantime,</i>
<i>let's celebrate with a dance.</i>

[ <i>Upbeat music plays</i> ]

00:36:09,306 --> 00:36:11,708
So, obviously, that's
an abbreviated lesson,

00:36:11,708 --> 00:36:13,944
but I wanted to show you
at least

00:36:13,944 --> 00:36:15,946
how the screen
and the robot

00:36:15,946 --> 00:36:17,280
actually interact together,

00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,682
presenting
important information.

00:36:18,682 --> 00:36:21,084
So, are you already
selling this?

00:36:21,084 --> 00:36:24,120
These are the first three
commercial versions

00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,623
that we have hot off
the manufacturing press.

00:36:26,623 --> 00:36:28,091
We do have some presales.

00:36:28,091 --> 00:36:30,393
We have about $140,000
in presales

00:36:30,393 --> 00:36:32,662
as of the last three months.
Is it a Kickstarter?

00:36:32,662 --> 00:36:35,398
No, actually,
through e‐mails,

00:36:35,398 --> 00:36:37,167
cold e‐mails, word of mouth,

00:36:37,167 --> 00:36:39,669
and basically a grant that we
got from the Department of Ed

00:36:39,669 --> 00:36:42,539
that is allowing us
to have 20 to 25 schools

00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:45,308
across the state of
South Carolina with robots.

00:36:45,308 --> 00:36:47,043
I spent nine years
in this space,

00:36:47,043 --> 00:36:48,578
in math and reading scores,

00:36:48,578 --> 00:36:50,280
with Reader Rabbit
at The Learning Company ‐‐

00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,549
"Carmen Sandiego,"
"Oregon Trail."

00:36:52,549 --> 00:36:56,152
Advancing math scores
is a big deal.

00:36:56,152 --> 00:36:59,856
Do you have any data that shows
you've advanced math scores

00:36:59,856 --> 00:37:01,324
in testing for kids?

00:37:01,324 --> 00:37:03,593
Yes. Actually, we did
an alpha pilot last year

00:37:03,593 --> 00:37:05,862
with about 220 students.

00:37:05,862 --> 00:37:08,164
And so we had
67% of the students

00:37:08,164 --> 00:37:10,100
actually improve
their math proficiency

00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,869
on two math skills
during that pilot.

00:37:12,869 --> 00:37:14,971
Laura, what's your background?
Are you a teacher? Are you ‐‐

00:37:14,971 --> 00:37:16,039
I'm not a teacher.

00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:18,441
I had a love for education,

00:37:18,441 --> 00:37:20,243
I had a love for technology,

00:37:20,243 --> 00:37:22,712
so I got a PhD in
computer science
and engineering.

00:37:22,712 --> 00:37:23,813
With what focus?

00:37:23,813 --> 00:37:26,116
With robotics,
social‐robotics focus.

00:37:26,116 --> 00:37:29,986
Is your plan for ABii to only
sell into the school system,

00:37:29,986 --> 00:37:31,121
or is this going to be
a consumer product

00:37:31,121 --> 00:37:32,689
for parents to buy?

00:37:32,689 --> 00:37:35,325
So, yes to both ‐‐
first with the school systems,

00:37:35,325 --> 00:37:36,927
with the after‐school programs

00:37:36,927 --> 00:37:39,663
and then eventually for
the direct‐to‐consumer sales.

00:37:39,663 --> 00:37:41,131
What does ABii cost?

00:37:41,131 --> 00:37:43,900
The commercial version of
ABii is $999 for schools.

00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,569
‐$999?
‐Wow.

00:37:45,569 --> 00:37:47,037
‐$999 for schools.
‐Yeah.

00:37:47,037 --> 00:37:48,238
‐Oh, my goodness!
‐Wow.

00:37:48,238 --> 00:37:50,173
Yes, but it comes with
all the curriculum ‐‐

00:37:50,173 --> 00:37:51,775
third, fourth, and fifth grade.

00:37:51,775 --> 00:37:54,144
It's only $599 for home use.

00:37:54,144 --> 00:37:56,546
What does it cost
to make an ABii?

00:37:56,546 --> 00:37:58,048
$250, delivered.

00:37:58,048 --> 00:37:59,683
Wow, that's expensive!
Yeah, ooh.

00:37:59,683 --> 00:38:00,817
Yeah.

00:38:00,817 --> 00:38:02,786
I think sometimes,
with something like this,

00:38:02,786 --> 00:38:04,588
it gets very complicated.

00:38:04,588 --> 00:38:07,390
What are your top three
selling features?

00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:09,593
ABii accelerates learning
for students

00:38:09,593 --> 00:38:11,962
that have difficulty with
attention.
Accelerates learning.

00:38:11,962 --> 00:38:14,364
What's number two?
Number two is it
breaks down barriers.

00:38:14,364 --> 00:38:16,600
So, a lot of students
have confidence issues

00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,001
in the classroom

00:38:18,001 --> 00:38:20,637
when they are asked a question
and they don't understand.

00:38:20,637 --> 00:38:22,639
They're afraid to speak up.

00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:23,707
So, what was number three?

00:38:23,707 --> 00:38:25,475
Parents tell us that
they have trouble

00:38:25,475 --> 00:38:28,111
motivating their students
to do math homework,

00:38:28,111 --> 00:38:29,946
and when they sit down
with ABii,

00:38:29,946 --> 00:38:33,617
they feel like there is
a sentient little robot

00:38:33,617 --> 00:38:35,151
that is paying
attention to them,

00:38:35,151 --> 00:38:38,088
that is part of their
learning journey.
So, I get that. Alright.

00:38:38,088 --> 00:38:40,090
I take you at your word
that it works,

00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:42,025
but it's so brand‐new.

00:38:42,025 --> 00:38:44,928
I'm not really sure how
you're going to be received

00:38:44,928 --> 00:38:46,763
or what your
competition is,

00:38:46,763 --> 00:38:50,667
because I know there
are others out there.

00:38:50,667 --> 00:38:53,436
And for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:38:53,436 --> 00:38:55,772
Cuban: Laura.
Thank you, Lori.

00:38:55,772 --> 00:38:57,107
If my fourth grader is sitting
right in front of it

00:38:57,107 --> 00:38:59,476
and it's interacting,
following the courseware,

00:38:59,476 --> 00:39:02,879
what data and how is it
collecting that data?

00:39:02,879 --> 00:39:05,348
We're collecting correct
and incorrect answers.

00:39:05,348 --> 00:39:07,050
We're collecting
timing on screens.

00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:08,985
We're also collecting attention.

00:39:08,985 --> 00:39:10,620
How does it know?
That's also being recorded.

00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,088
We look at the head orientation,

00:39:12,088 --> 00:39:13,957
and then we know
that that head orientation

00:39:13,957 --> 00:39:15,392
corresponds
to where the screen is.

00:39:15,392 --> 00:39:17,927
Now we're getting into what
makes it unique, right?

00:39:17,927 --> 00:39:20,697
Now we start to understand
what differentiates you

00:39:20,697 --> 00:39:22,265
from a little Teddy bear
sitting there.
Sure.

00:39:22,265 --> 00:39:24,668
Let me just jump in.
So, I love the education space,

00:39:24,668 --> 00:39:28,038
but, for me, with 220 students
who have used it so far

00:39:28,038 --> 00:39:29,773
and with the competitive space,

00:39:29,773 --> 00:39:31,474
you know,
there's so many companies

00:39:31,474 --> 00:39:34,244
that are out there right now
trying to bridge ‐‐
Who is doing this?

00:39:34,244 --> 00:39:38,281
There's a lot just on the iPad,
you know, or on your computer.

00:39:38,281 --> 00:39:40,784
I feel like it's pretty early.
I'm out.

00:39:40,784 --> 00:39:43,286
Okay. Sorry to hear that.

00:39:43,286 --> 00:39:45,989
It took me nine years

00:39:45,989 --> 00:39:49,659
to get "Oregon Trail"
into 70% of the schools.

00:39:49,659 --> 00:39:51,928
And there hasn't been
a successful company

00:39:51,928 --> 00:39:53,229
to play
an educational product

00:39:53,229 --> 00:39:57,534
that advances test scores
in consumer and school

00:39:57,534 --> 00:39:58,935
since The Learning Company.

00:39:58,935 --> 00:40:00,103
There's never been
another one

00:40:00,103 --> 00:40:02,205
because these markets
are so different now.

00:40:02,205 --> 00:40:04,808
Let me just throw in one
more thing and interject.

00:40:04,808 --> 00:40:07,177
I understand the sales cycle.

00:40:07,177 --> 00:40:09,112
I'm a fighter, you know?

00:40:09,112 --> 00:40:10,914
No, I get it. I get it.

00:40:10,914 --> 00:40:12,916
I was a stay‐at‐home mom
with three kids

00:40:12,916 --> 00:40:15,985
before I decided to go back and
get my PhD in computer science.

00:40:15,985 --> 00:40:18,288
This is the tip of the iceberg
you see here.

00:40:18,288 --> 00:40:20,156
We've got already schools
signed up galore.

00:40:20,156 --> 00:40:22,125
They want the empirical data.

00:40:22,125 --> 00:40:24,427
We've got Boys &amp; Girls Clubs
signed up,

00:40:24,427 --> 00:40:25,829
already purchased their robots

00:40:25,829 --> 00:40:27,697
so they can participate
in the study.

00:40:27,697 --> 00:40:29,599
This is not something
that you see with apps.

00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:30,867
It's ‐‐ It's more ‐‐
It doesn't happen.

00:40:30,867 --> 00:40:32,068
Laura, it's more that

00:40:32,068 --> 00:40:34,904
"Do I want to go back
to those days?"

00:40:34,904 --> 00:40:37,841
We did $850 million
in consumer

00:40:37,841 --> 00:40:39,943
and 80 in the schools,

00:40:39,943 --> 00:40:41,978
and I spent 90% of my day

00:40:41,978 --> 00:40:43,046
worrying about
the school business.

00:40:43,046 --> 00:40:44,180
It's brutal.

00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,749
Sure.
It's brutal.

00:40:45,749 --> 00:40:48,451
And I just ‐‐
I can't go back.
It's a segue.

00:40:48,451 --> 00:40:49,719
I can't go back.
It's a segue.

00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:51,121
It's like going back
to Hell for me.

00:40:51,121 --> 00:40:52,288
So...
[ Laughs ]

00:40:52,288 --> 00:40:53,423
When did you ever leave?
I can't do it.

00:40:53,423 --> 00:40:55,058
I'm out. I'm out.
I'm out.

00:40:57,427 --> 00:40:59,429
I'm in
the curriculum space.

00:40:59,429 --> 00:41:01,464
I have a digital curriculum,
interactive.

00:41:01,464 --> 00:41:03,900
When I tried to sell it
to the schools,

00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,602
they couldn't care less,

00:41:05,602 --> 00:41:08,204
because they already have
their systems,

00:41:08,204 --> 00:41:11,341
and to echo what
Kevin's saying, it's brutal.

00:41:11,341 --> 00:41:12,809
It takes
just such a long time.

00:41:12,809 --> 00:41:14,944
And you want to do
two different things.

00:41:14,944 --> 00:41:16,479
And I believe in
what you're doing.

00:41:16,479 --> 00:41:19,282
I just don't want to take that
long ride with you, so I'm out.

00:41:20,316 --> 00:41:21,885
Look,
I disagree with Kevin.

00:41:21,885 --> 00:41:25,088
If you have a better mousetrap
that is so phenomenally better,

00:41:25,088 --> 00:41:27,824
right, people will beat a path
down to your door.
Sure.

00:41:27,824 --> 00:41:30,026
But you haven't shown me
something that's gonna say

00:41:30,026 --> 00:41:33,263
"When I walk in the door
and put my name on ABii,

00:41:33,263 --> 00:41:35,231
people are gonna say 'Wow.'"

00:41:35,231 --> 00:41:37,700
What is it that
you have or will have

00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:40,303
that segregates you
from anybody

00:41:40,303 --> 00:41:42,539
who can possibly consider
getting into this space?

00:41:42,539 --> 00:41:44,974
So, when you sit down
and ABii recognizes

00:41:44,974 --> 00:41:47,377
where you left off
and understands you

00:41:47,377 --> 00:41:49,813
and knows that you like,
as a third grader,

00:41:49,813 --> 00:41:50,980
a wiggle break

00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,749
and not a stretch break,
for example,

00:41:52,749 --> 00:41:55,752
and the robot,
every time you log into it,

00:41:55,752 --> 00:41:57,487
knows more about you,

00:41:57,487 --> 00:42:00,190
you establish
a social connection

00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,891
that is really powerful.

00:42:01,891 --> 00:42:04,561
Yeah, see, I just ‐‐
that's not enough, Laura.

Boccanfuso: Kevin's feedback

00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:15,605
about it being

00:42:15,605 --> 00:42:17,707
I agree with 100%.

00:42:17,707 --> 00:42:19,242

00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:23,079
They're worth it,
