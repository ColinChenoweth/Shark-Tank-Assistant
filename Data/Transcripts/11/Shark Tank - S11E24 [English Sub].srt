The $199 hammock,
how much do you pay for it?

$44 is our landed cost.

Connors: Yeah!

00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,068
Our inspiration
to start this

00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:04,402
was to literally end poverty

00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:07,238
in really vulnerable communities
in the developing world.

00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:10,275
The idea for the company
started when I initially

00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:13,011
went on a backpacking trip
across southeast Asia.

We were living together
in Boston at the time.

00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:19,351
And I stumbled across
a hammock on a remote island,

00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:21,620
and I was immediately struck
by how soft it was.

00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,887
I was really impressed
with the quality,

00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:24,356
and I started asking
them some questions

00:35:24,356 --> 00:35:27,058
and learned that it was woven
by this hill tribe community.

00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:29,294
It was part of
an economic development program

00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:31,029
to help this hill tribe
group out of poverty,

00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:32,063
and I was really struck
by that.

00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:33,064
In Thailand?

00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,265
In Thailand.
In Thailand, yeah.

00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:35,967
So, I went to this community,
and I got to meet

00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,602
the actual weavers
and hear their stories,

00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:39,070
and I learned
that this community

00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,538
that started
making the hammocks,

00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:41,740
with the help
of an aid worker,

00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,742
had been previously
in debt slavery,

00:35:43,742 --> 00:35:45,210
and the thing
that really struck me

00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,779
was a lot of people
kept coming to this community

00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:49,314
asking to join
the program,

00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:50,815
but they were being
turned away

00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,384
because there weren't
enough sales.

00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:55,320
And I thought, "Well, we can
start a little hammock company

00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,822
and provide enough jobs
in this region."

00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,325
So I came home with a backpack
stuffed full of hammocks,

00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:02,227

Greiner:
When I started my business,
started with one product,

00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:25,123
I took out a bank loan,
it was about $325,000.

00:40:25,123 --> 00:40:28,126
I paid it back within a year,
and I never had to take a loan

00:40:28,126 --> 00:40:29,961
or bring in
an investor again.

00:40:29,961 --> 00:40:32,597

you need to just sit there

00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:33,965

all these investors

00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:35,500

a whole ton of money.

00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,435
You just need to be
strategically smart

00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,870

the right investor.

I'm going to fund purchase
