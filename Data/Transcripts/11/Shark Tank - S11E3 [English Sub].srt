is that we extract carbon

we then use high pressure,

were effectively
her family.

when Garrett and I
kind of came back,

"Okay, customer experience
is everything,

how to do that.

00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:10,516
through using design,
technology, and innovation.

00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,353
And that's why we created
the Baobab polo shirt...

00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,188
The perfect polo shirt!
...the perfect polo shirt!

00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,356
The Baobab polo shirt

00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,291
is made from the best cotton
in the world ‐‐

00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,492
Peruvian Pima cotton.

00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:22,161
Now, through our proprietary
fabrication process

00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:22,862
called BaoTech,

00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:26,432
it makes this shirt
completely resistant to stains,

00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:27,467
like coffee?

00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,435
Coming right up.

00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:30,470
‐Wow.
‐Whoa

00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,571
‐Wow.
‐Like wine.

00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:34,440
Did you order Pinot Noir?
I did, I did.

00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,541
‐Wow.
‐Dang.

00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,343
Cuban: Not the ketchup!

00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:38,478
No!
Davenport:
I used to always hate

00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:40,213
when something like this
would happen.

00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:42,548
[ Laughter ]

00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,351
Like I said,
not the ketchup!

00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:48,254
‐No!
‐Not the ketchup.

00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:49,455
Here you go, bro.

00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:50,556
Absolutely.

00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,458
‐Wow.
‐Wow!

00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,394
Sharks,
when I do decide to wash it,

00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:55,728
it's not gonna shrink
or fade.

00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,631
And with our patent‐pending
stay‐flat collar,

00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:01,601
we keep collars looking great
for a really long time.

00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:03,503
Sharks,
let's take a bite

00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:05,805
out of this $30 billion
menswear industry

00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:09,575
and join us in making
undeniably better polo shirts.

00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,177
All right. Very cool.

00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:11,811
Great presentation!

00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:13,713
And meanwhile, I want to
make sure that I see you guys,

00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:16,582
so I'm gonna go ahead
and clean off my glasses

00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,317
with this hidden
microfiber cloth

00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:19,352
that's on the inside.

00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:21,220
Greiner: Oh, you're kidding.

00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,655
[ Laughs ]
Cuban: [ Laughs ]

00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:24,490
But wait, there's more!
Alexander: Just to make sure
we can see each other.

00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,192
Greiner: That's so smart.

00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:26,759
Yeah,
that is a cool idea.

00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,661
Herjavec: Oh,
the material's great.

00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:29,796
Davenport: Nice black polo.
It's the all black.

00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:31,597
Thank you.
We have the black polo
for you there.

00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,666
Greiner:
Oh, and it's a zipper.

00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,436
O'Leary: So, guys,
is this 100% pure cotton?

00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,272
So, it's 98%
Peruvian Pima cotton,

00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,340
and then there's
2% stretch.

00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,442
And what do you
charge for it?

00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,643
We charge $98.

00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:46,746
What stops the ketchup
from staining the white shirt?

00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:49,282
Yeah, so,
that's the BaoTech.

00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,450
So, it's a treatment

00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,385
when we produce
the fabric of the shirt

00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:54,587
that's added
that protects the shirts.

00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:58,357
My biggest pet peeve
with polo shirts is the collars.

00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:59,592
‐Yes!
‐The bacon collar.

00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:01,561
‐Right.
‐That is such a great idea.

00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:02,728
And I'm glad
you brought that up.

00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:04,430
We actually have
a provisional patent

00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,598
on our stay‐flat collar.

00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:07,567
Can you tell us
what's your background,

00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,302
what did you used to do
before this?

00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,536
And same with you.

00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:11,804
Yeah, so,
I worked at a media company.

00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,173
I did partnerships,
media partnerships ‐‐

00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:14,807
Which one?

00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,410
So, Hearst Media is one of them,
and also Travelzoo.

00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,478
And, Brandon,
what do you do?

00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,646
So, I worked at companies
like American Express

00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,315
managing
their mobile app.

00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,549
When did you start
this business?

00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,852
So, we actually did
a crowdfunding campaign

00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:28,521
to get the funding
behind the research
and development

00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:29,755
back in 2017.

00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,491
You did a crowdfunding campaign
for the research?

00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,492
Yes.

00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,559
How much did you raise?

00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,861
It was $32,000.

00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:36,696
Greiner: That's brilliant.
Well, you had to deliver
a product, right?

00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:37,697
Yeah, and we delivered
the product ‐‐

00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:39,799
so we pre‐sold shirts
for that.

00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,734
You're saying
you're worth $1.5 million.

00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,603
That means
that you must have sold,

00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:44,637
within the last year,

00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:47,173
$800,000 worth
of product.

00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:47,874
And?

00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:51,577
So, uh, we've done $85,000
in gross revenue.

00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:52,845
‐That's it?
‐That's it?

00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,515
Yeah, because, uh, we're not
VC‐backed or anything.

00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,483
We had to put our own money
and reinvest into, uh ‐‐

00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:59,585
How much of your own money
have you put in?

00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:01,654
About $35,000.

00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:04,524
Maybe you're not worth
$1.5 million.

00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,192
No, really?

00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,695
Well, maybe
you're worth more.
Well, I never get upset
about crazy valuations

00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,930
'cause I believe in the vision.

00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,566
We've sold $32,000 worth
of inventory, so...

00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:14,634
‐Wow.
‐Oh.

00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:15,701
All off of
your website?

00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,670
A little off
from the $800,000.

00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,005
Right, but being
digital marketers,

00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:22,208
we understand our customer,
we understand the data sets

00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:22,808
and where we can go,

00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,911
and the more we turn up
our digital ads ‐‐

00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:27,713
Herjavec: Before we argue
about your valuation...
Yeah.

00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,316
...I invested in a company
last year called Butter Cloth...

00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:31,284
Mm‐hmm.
Okay.

00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:31,817
...and we've done

00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:35,187
about $3.5 million
worth of sales.

00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:35,688
Yeah.

00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:37,456
This is fascinating to me.

00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:40,426
Tell me how you spent $32,000

00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:41,861
to create
a proprietary material.

00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:46,032
So, the proprietary element
of the shirt is BaoTech.

00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:47,967
But what is that?
Is that a chemical
or is that material?

00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:49,635
Shrinking, fading, stains,
and odors ‐‐
It's the process
behind that ‐‐

00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:50,770
Anybody can get that.
Anybody can do that, right?

00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:51,771
Can anybody do that?
Anybody can do it.

00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:52,939
We own the name
behind BaoTech.

00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:54,707
You can buy ‐‐
There's a lot of
different technologies

00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:56,709
that you can try
to piece together,

00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:57,777
different things that ‐‐

00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:58,878
So, I want to be
really clear on that.

00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:00,780
What you're asking me
to invest in

00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,615
is you two guys
and the brand.

00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:04,650
Yes.
Not in a proprietary
material.

00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,619
No, no.
Correct.

00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:10,690
So, guys, if I go online
and just search polos,

00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,725
there are thousands
of options.

00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:14,627
Zillions.
Sure. Sure.
Okay?

00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:15,895
Huge marketplace.
If I go into retail,

00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:17,063
there are hundreds of choices
I can make

00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:19,332
at different price points
with different brands.

00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:20,499
Absolutely.

00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:21,867
Some brands,
very well‐known globally.

00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:24,670
Then there's...
Bobab, right?

00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,705
Baobab.
Baobab.

00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:26,706
‐Baobab.
‐Baobab.

00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:28,407
That's another problem.
Baobab.

00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:29,475
What?

00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:30,610
Baobab...
O'Leary: Baobab.

00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,711
...it's the tree of life
in Africa.

00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:32,778
We wanted to pick a name

00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:33,946
that represented strength
and longevity ‐‐

00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,648
How about a name
people can pronounce?

00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:36,716
Let's go with that.

00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:39,752
Look, guys,
this is a story

00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:41,621
about a very special
polo shirt...

00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:42,655
It is.
Davenport: Yes.

00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:44,490
...in a really
competitive market.

00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,658
Really competitive.

00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,860
So, in the last two months,
we've done $35,000 ‐‐

00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,995
Cuban: So tell us
how you sold ‐‐
That's nothing!

00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:51,831
No, wait, so tell us
how you sold $35,000.

00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53,699
To Kevin's point,
you have to communicate that

00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:54,867
and translate that
into sales.

00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,636
Tell us
how you're doing that.

00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,772
Our cost per acquisition,
our cost per sale is $38.

00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:01,707
We sell primarily online.

00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,709
How are people finding you?

00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:06,579
Uh, so, it's on Facebook ads
and Instagram ads, as well.

00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:07,980
And we've also gotten
some recent press

00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,715
for being one of
the best polo shirts

00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:10,783
to buy this summer.

00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:12,084
There's nothing special
about the shirt

00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,720
in regards to it can be done
by any and everybody,

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,523
but I think that
you've made slight adjustments

00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:18,791
to make something
really great,

00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,060
'cause the shirt
is a great shirt.

00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,563
But you have a $1.5 million
valuation there.

00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:26,032
What is the reasoning
for that?

00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:27,800
So, we have
more inventory coming

00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,602
and we're looking to sell
a lot more

00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:31,570
and close the year out
at $400,000.

00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,473
So, we did a 3 times
multiple of that.

00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:34,974
Of what?

00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:36,642
Of ‐‐ Of the ‐‐
Of 3 1/2 times ‐‐

00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:37,777
Of future sales.

00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:39,879
'Cause we're gonna get there
at the end of the year.

00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:42,948
I have learned
to not listen to Daymond

00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,750
and love
the clothing business.

00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,786
We're doing really well
with Butter Cloth,

00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:49,021
and we're about
to introduce a polo,

00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,424
so it would be
competitive for me.

00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:52,458
I'm out.

00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,559
Okay.

00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:54,694
Is this full‐time
for you guys now?

00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:55,761
It is full‐time.
Yes.

00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:56,829
And you guys are still
based in New York?

00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:57,763
‐Yes.
‐We're based in New York City.

00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:58,931
How are you living?

00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,700
Occasionally,
we've, like, paid ourselves,

00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,667
but nothing serious.

00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,569
