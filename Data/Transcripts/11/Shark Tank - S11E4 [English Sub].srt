00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,464
their heart, their soul,
and the grinding it out,

00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:12,499

I think the digital strategy ‐‐

00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:22,676

we're doing and how to acquire.

But there's still tweaking
to be done.
Of course.

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,581

that there's a lot to do

00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:29,849
with physical retail.

00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,584
What do you mean
"physical retail"?
What do you mean "retail"?

00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,620
We could put this out
to retailers.

00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,889
You want them to sell
the service and you just share.

00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:37,857
So, in Williams‐Sonoma,
they put up a sign,

00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,960
they say "Have your knives
sharpened by Knife Aid,"

00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,496
you pay Williams‐Sonoma,
you know, 25% of it...
Exactly.

00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:44,631
...and you try to get
every retailer,

00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:45,665
not just Williams‐Sonoma.

00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:46,766
And that is brand‐building

00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,735
because they need
to give us their e‐mail,

00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,470
and then
we catch them again.

00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,504
That's easy money, too.

00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:52,806
‐So, that's the second channel?
‐Yes.

00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,608

"Pick a contact, any contact."

00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,163
I don't know if anybody
really <i>wants</i> Plop Star.

00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,633
I'll tell you guys a little bit
about my background.

00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:15,634
‐Please do.
‐Yeah.

00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,469
I've worked at
large advertising firms,

00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,570
and five years ago,

00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,572
I actually started
my own production company.

00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,040
I've been
incredibly successful.

00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,344
I do broadcast spots
for large corporations ‐‐

00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:26,745
advertising, PR ‐‐

00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:29,781
and also direct
to tech firms.

00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:31,850
And I wanted to create
a product ‐‐

00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,720
something that I could
create the content for

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,823
that looks super professional
at a cheap rate.

00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:40,092
And I kind of had my "Aha"
moment a couple years ago.

00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:43,629
My little daughter,
she loves making bath bombs,

00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:44,763
and I was like, "Wow.

00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:46,632
This would be the perfect
form factor."

00:27:46,632 --> 00:27:47,733
Okay.
That makes sense.

00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:49,768
So that was
my big "Aha" moment.

00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:53,639
There is an 800‐pound gorilla
in this market.

00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:54,840
I guess I'll say ‐‐
It's Poo‐Pourri.

00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,576
Yeah, of course.
Yeah. And it's
a $300 million brand.

00:27:57,576 --> 00:27:59,778
They did $56.5 million.

00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:00,946
It's a growing category.

00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:03,615
The convenience of not
having to carry a bottle ‐‐

00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:04,816
it's innovative.

00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:07,786
And listen, Squatty Potty
is my investment.

00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:09,621
Correct.
And everybody laughed

00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:10,889
at a little stool
that helps you poop.

00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,658
No, I believe in toilet
in portfolio.

00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:16,628
But they have just hit
$160 million in sales,

5 million
Squatty Potties sold.

00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:23,969
So, you know,
this could potentially fit

00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:26,838
within my family
of entrepreneurs

00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:27,973
in the Squatty Potty.

Oza: What you've created here
is interesting.

00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:32,878
I think that you've made
the form factor convenient,

00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:36,515
and I don't think
that the target audience for you

00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:37,883
is B‐to‐C in consumers.

00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:40,118
Because when people go
to other bathrooms,

00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,888
there's a mind‐set
that's absolutely bizarre.

00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,022
They have no respect.

00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:47,726
So you kind of need to target
a business model...

00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,595
You mean public?

00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:50,796
...where that people

00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:53,565
who are working in hotels
or public restrooms are like,

00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,067
"I can drop this
every time."

00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,868
'Cause it's the guy
before and after me

00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:58,036
that destroys the place.

00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:00,672
But don't you think
it's a little bit expensive

00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:01,673
to sell to businesses?

00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:02,708
That's the problem
right there.

00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:03,775
Because it is pricy.

00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,844

of things

00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:09,114
and, you know,
the cheap‐as‐can‐be

00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:11,683
because they're just
pouring it down a toilet

00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:12,818
and they don't care.
Yes.

00:29:12,818 --> 00:29:14,786

I don't believe is gonna work.

00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:15,887

respectful, intellectual guy,

very bright,
assessing, analyzing,

00:29:27,733 --> 00:29:29,067
figuring out
how you're gonna do it.

00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:31,903
You get it right, you're gonna
get all the pieces in place.

00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:33,772
But you forgot
to take it out to market

00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,107
and see if there's
even a demand there.

00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:37,576
I don't believe there's
a demand for this product,

00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:38,844

00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,418
Now I've had my fourth.
I'm starting to dig it.

00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:15,453
That's some good paper,
though, right?
And you know what I'm
really liking about it?

00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:17,322
I'm only eating 80 calories
for the whole bag.

00:34:17,322 --> 00:34:19,190
I know.
That's what I like.

00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:22,127
This was my chance to really
make my impact, you know?

00:34:22,127 --> 00:34:24,296
I love junk food.
Everyone likes junk food.

00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:25,530
But the problem is, it's junk.

00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:28,133
No one else has figured out
how to use fresh ingredients ‐‐

00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:30,235
not some weird,
powdered form of it ‐‐

00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:32,971
fresh ingredients to make
a shelf‐stable chip

00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:34,139
that tastes like junk food.

00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:35,340
And that "Aha" moment came

00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,076
because we knew that
we had something special.

00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,244
Samy, who's "we"?

00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:41,212
I say "we" 'cause we're
a big family at Snacklins.

00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:43,081
So, everyone
from our first employees

00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,182
who are still with us today,

00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:46,284
angel investors,
friends and family ‐‐

00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:48,353
you know, everyone has
a piece of the company, so...

00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:51,122
So, how much of the company
do <i>you</i> have?

00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:52,190
I personally own 30%.

00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,358
How much
do the employees own?

00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:55,126
The employees
have a 10% pool.

00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:56,361
Good for you.
That's awesome.
Thank you.

00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:59,898
This is probably the sportiest
valuation I've seen in a while.

00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:00,432
$10 million.

00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,267
$10 million valuation,
correct?

00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,069
I hope you have some sales,
Samy.

00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:05,203
I think
you'll appreciate this.

00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:08,506
Last year,
we sold $200,000 in product,

00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:11,209
and this year, we'll finish
the year at around $2 million.

00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:14,012
What?!
We've grown tenfold
in the past year,

00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:16,314
selling to about
850 stores nationwide.

00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:18,149
Wow.
We started off
with 36 stores

00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:19,384
about a year and a half ago.

00:35:19,384 --> 00:35:21,386
From mom‐and‐pops
to national chains,

00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:24,522
such as Whole Foods,
Walmart, 7‐Eleven.

00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:26,591
We went out there,
we hit the pavement ourselves.

00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:29,394
I mean, I can tell you, when I
had that meeting with 7‐Eleven,

00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:31,463
my baby was born
the night beforehand.

00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:34,366
And so, four hours later,
I jumped on a plane

00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:37,068
and I went to Dallas, and I met
with the heads of 7‐Eleven.

00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:38,103
Respect the hustle.

00:35:38,103 --> 00:35:39,304
I'll do anything
I have to,

00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,272
because Snacklins
is that important to us.

00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:43,308
‐I respect the hustle.
‐Break down the numbers for me.

00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:46,244
We're running, currently,
at about 30% gross margin.

00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:47,379
We've invested
a lot in ourselves

00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:49,280
with, you know,
building our own factory.

00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,415
We're not using
some co‐packer.

00:35:50,415 --> 00:35:51,549
Oh, you built
your own factory?

00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:53,385
‐We built our own.
‐Kevin's gonna love this one.

00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:55,220
I want to see the same employees
that I had with me ‐‐

00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,454
‐Why would you do that, Samy?
‐I offered.

00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:58,156
'Cause we're building
American jobs,

00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,424
and I think that creating
American jobs ‐‐

00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:01,192
No, but there's
co‐packers in America

00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:02,527
that already spent
the money.

00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:04,562
But they're <i>not,</i> and that's why
I think Snacklins is so unique.

00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:07,265
There's not a single co‐packer
that is doing what we're doing.

00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:09,200
I'm entirely for
building your own factory

00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,236
because I've never seen
a food product succeed

00:36:11,236 --> 00:36:12,570
where they didn't take control
of the kitchen.

00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,472
Mm‐hmm.
It's an essential thing
you have to do,

00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:17,075
but that you did it so quickly
shocks me.

00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:18,410
How much money
did you raise?

00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,412
We raised $1.5 million
to date.

00:36:20,412 --> 00:36:21,579
‐Wow.
‐Wow. That was quick.

00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:23,481
‐That's a lot of trust.
‐It's a lot of trust.

00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:25,417
We've had some
pretty great partners throughout

00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:27,218
that have helped us
get through there.

00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:28,319
Why do you need us?

00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:30,321
Because we're about
11 months, 12 months away

00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:31,456
from becoming profitable.

00:36:31,456 --> 00:36:33,558
I have enough money
to last me about 10 months,

00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:35,460
and not only do I think
a strategic Shark

00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,462
who, A, could help me out
with retailers,

00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:39,397
could help me out
with really exploring

00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:41,433
the avenues that it is out
there, but that would give us

00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:43,201
that last two months
of funding we need

00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,302
before we become profitable.

00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:45,503
So, what do you sell
each bag for?

00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:48,373
So, each bag goes for about
$1.99 to $2.29 on the shelf

00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,275
depending where it's at.
And what's your cost?

00:36:50,275 --> 00:36:52,844
Our cost right now
is about 90 cents.

00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:55,246
Wow.
So, your margins
aren't awesome,

00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,348
and that's
part of the problem.

00:36:57,348 --> 00:37:00,385
I invested in a phenomenal
business called Pipcorn.

00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,320
Mm‐hmm.
And if I were
to say to you that today,

00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,123
they have 3,500 stores
and $12 million in sales,

00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:07,192
you would say
"Wow. What a success."

00:37:07,192 --> 00:37:09,294
But now I'm gonna give you
the other side of it.

00:37:09,294 --> 00:37:11,229
They have
negligible profit.

00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,364
I haven't made a dime
on that business,

00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,033
and they've just
finished selling off

00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:16,134
about 1/3 of the business

00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:18,203
to try to raise
yet more money again

00:37:18,203 --> 00:37:20,405
for the slotting fees
to buy the shelf space.

00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:22,640
This food space is tough.

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,611
But most importantly, it takes
enormous amounts of money.

00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:28,246
That's the problem.
You're gonna chip
your way down.

00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,416
You constantly have to feed
the dragon with more cash.

00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:34,085
So, because I've been there
and done that...

00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,320
Mm‐hmm.

00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,321
...I'm out.

00:37:36,321 --> 00:37:38,156
Alright,
thank you, Barbara.

00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:41,426
I love things
in the space

00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:45,263
of being 80 calories for
a healthy, lighter snack.

00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,432
But I feel
it's a little too risky

00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:49,300
and too early for me
right now.

00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,369
Your valuation
doesn't make sense.

00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:53,338
‐Oh, I appreciate that.
‐So, I'm sorry. I'm out.

00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:55,073
Thank you so much.

00:37:55,073 --> 00:37:56,174
‐Samy, look here.
‐Yeah?

00:37:56,174 --> 00:37:57,609
I really do like
your ingredients,

00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:00,278
and I like the trend
that you're going down.

00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:04,215
But where I struggle is,
your valuation's out to lunch,

00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:06,317
you own your own manufacturing,
which I hate.

00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:10,054
Manufacturing your own stuff
in this industry

00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:11,389
is just tough as heck.

00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:12,757
And I would 100% agree.

00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:17,195
And it is economically
just not viable, long‐term.

00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:20,031
So, unfortunately,
I'm out.

00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:20,765
Well, thank you.

00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:22,534
I think the reason that we are
doing our own manufacturing

00:38:22,534 --> 00:38:24,569
is because no one else
has figured out how to do this.

00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:26,938
Yeah, look.
They're wrong.

00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:30,275
I talk about Alyssa's Cookies
all the time.

00:38:30,275 --> 00:38:31,476
You're familiar with them,
right?
Absolutely. Yeah.

00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:34,112
So, started ‐‐ the guy was
living out of his car,

00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:34,746
had no money, came to me,

00:38:34,746 --> 00:38:39,384
and now six years later,
we'll do $20 million in sales.

00:38:39,384 --> 00:38:43,321
The better part is, we'll do
$8 or $9 million in profits

00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,623
that'll be distributed
to <i>me.</i>

00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:48,359
Yeah.
And so
we're killing it.

00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:51,095
Now, one of the things that
I fought Doug on originally

00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:51,663
was his own factory.

00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,498
Mm‐hmm.
I was wrong,
he was right,

00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,333
because he was
the only one

00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,235
who could do the process
that he invented.

00:38:57,235 --> 00:38:59,204
So, having
something unique ‐‐

00:38:59,204 --> 00:39:00,538

$10 million valuation.

you only have 30%,

under the bus, right?

I want to be fair.

with all due respect,

I used to own
100% of nothing,

00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,624
and I'm living
the American dream.

I like it.

00:41:09,734 --> 00:41:11,769
And so, yeah,
I'll work with you, you know?
Come back with something.

I'd like, you know ‐‐
But you're here now,

over three years.
