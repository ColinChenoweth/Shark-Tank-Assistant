You're making my point.
O'Leary: Yeah.

00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:02,389
So, what you guys have
is a great product,

00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:04,491
but it's not
obviously different.

00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:05,592
And so because of that,

00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,560
you have to find
a way to market it.

00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,795
And you haven't
found that yet.

00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:11,731
And so, because you're not
quite sure how to market it,

00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:14,534
you're searching for things
that are accelerants.

00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:15,735
You want to add
more sizes

00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:18,505
because somebody told you
you need more sizes.

You want to copy
potentially Build‐A‐Bear

00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:23,476
so that when somebody comes,
they have more alternatives

00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,545
and maybe that'll get them
to buy the shoes.

00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,681
You haven't figured out
the way to market it yet.

00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:30,450

You know,
most often in "Shark Tank,"

00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,828

ridiculous valuations.

where you've actually come in

00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,537
with a realistic valuation ‐‐
just over $600,000.

00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:53,340

becomes,

this idea? What's your history?

My first ice cream shop,

00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:06,304
I started with my mom
in 2010,

00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:10,041
and then in 2017,
when we opened The Yard,

00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:12,377
we had an opportunity
to go into a spot

00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:14,479
who had multiple failed
ice cream shops in it before.

00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:17,082
So we knew we had to come up
with something really exciting,

00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:19,351
like, really extravagant
to get people coming in.

00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:21,152
Chelsea,
what town are you in?

00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:23,188
Gulf Shores, Alabama,
was our first location.

00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:24,623
What is <i>your</i> history?
Because ‐‐

00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:27,158
Logan: My father owned an
electrical contracting company.

00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:29,427
We started from scratch.

00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:31,496
He worked us
like any dad works you.

00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:33,331
Learned the ethic
from him, for sure.

00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:35,133
And Ali's story
is what?

00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,201
Ali,
what's your background?

00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:38,069
We're married,
and this is our sister‐in‐law.

00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:40,005
This is chief of operations
Ali Rose Green.

00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:41,439
Ali is my sister‐in‐law,

00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:45,076
and she decided
to come work for us

00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:47,445
when we opened The Yard,
just lines out the door.

We couldn't keep up
with the demand.

You said "multiple units."
Where are your other units?

00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:52,851
Yeah, 'cause you started
to grow, you said, right?

00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:53,385
Yes.
Yes.

00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:56,221
Well, we have
went into franchising now.

00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:59,391
So, our first location
was Gulf Shores in 2017, May.

00:35:59,391 --> 00:36:01,393
Our second location
was in Panama City Beach,

00:36:01,393 --> 00:36:03,161
which is about
three hours away,

00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,163
and that was the following year,
in 2018.

00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,465
We also opened a store
in Fairhope, Alabama.

00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,300
We also have a store
in Austin, Texas.

00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,002
Walk me through
the franchise deal.

00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,237
What do I pay you?

00:36:12,237 --> 00:36:16,141
So, the franchise license is
$45,000 for a 10‐year license.

00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:20,178
We take a 6% continuing royalty
of net sales.

00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:24,349
We also take a 2% royalty
for national marketing.

00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:26,551

square feet?

00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:43,268
We started out
in 1,000 square feet.

What's that store,
the one that's doing 1.4?

That's the same store.

00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:50,241
We upgraded it last year
to 3,500 square feet.

00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:53,111
All the extra space
is seating for the customers?

00:36:53,111 --> 00:36:54,245
Yes.

00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:56,181
Oh, it's a sit‐down restaurant.
Are they all sit‐down?

00:36:56,181 --> 00:36:57,282
No.
It's a milkshake bar.

00:36:57,282 --> 00:36:58,349
It is.
So, they'll come in.

00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:00,218
We have a menu.
They'll fill out the menu.

00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,419
They check the items
they like,

00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:04,189
and then they give it
to our assembly team,

00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:05,356
and we have
specialized decorators.

00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:07,425

any way you can think of it.

But why is it so big ‐‐
3,500 square feet?

00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:15,567
Well, Gulf Shores
is a seasonal town,

00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,235
so we have to have
that square footage

00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,470
to pack as much volume
in there

00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,371

as possible.

Logan:
We went with Mark today

00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:35,560
because he shares
the same vision as us.

00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,395
We wanted
to maintain our stores,

00:41:37,395 --> 00:41:38,429
and he's just the right guy.

00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:39,630
He knows Texas.
He knows Dallas.

00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,466
He knows the areas
we really want to go to,

00:41:41,466 --> 00:41:42,867
and I really think
he's the right guy.
