00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:17,229
all you have to do is take it
and go with you.

00:33:17,229 --> 00:33:18,997
Greiner: Wow.
So, it's very easy to carry
and store.

00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,165
John: Very cool.

00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,067
And the next morning,
there's gonna be a layer

00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:23,301
of morning dew on here,

00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:26,938
but all you have to do
is open it up,

00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:28,173
flip it open.

00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:31,142
The perfect sofa
ready for you to enjoy.

00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:34,746
So, we've created
the perfect outdoor sofa,

00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:35,280
but we realized

00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,215
that the shopping experience
wasn't great.

00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:39,184
Typically, when you see
an outdoor sofa,

00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:40,318
you see it inside,

00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:41,453
in a climate‐controlled
environment

00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:45,223
where it never has
seen sun, rain, or bird poop.

00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:47,259
So, we've actually
revolutionized

00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:48,326
the shopping experience.

00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:50,128
We've developed
a proprietary,

00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:51,429
peer‐to‐peer showroom
platform.

00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:54,165
It's where we convert
our customer's showrooms

00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:55,967
into our showrooms,

00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:58,336
and in doing so,
customers can see, touch,

00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:01,239
and feel the sofa
before they decide to buy.

00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:03,208
It's something that we call
a Neighborhood Showroom.

00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:06,111
It's a sharing economy
for retail.

00:34:06,111 --> 00:34:08,046
Liu: So, Sharks,
who is ready to join us

00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,348
to bring life outside?

00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:12,384
O'Leary:
How much does the sofa cost?

00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:14,085
So, the sofa you're looking at
right now,

00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:16,187
the three‐seater
is $2,500.

00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:17,355
‐$2,500?
‐Okay.

00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:18,356
Greiner:
I don't think that's bad.

00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:19,958
What does it cost you
landed?

00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:22,193
So, each chair is $800.

00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:23,328
They're modular,
by the way.

00:34:23,328 --> 00:34:27,165
Each retail cost is $825
when you average it out.

00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:30,201
And then the cost of goods made
is about $225 or so.

00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:32,070
‐$225.
‐$225.
‐Yep, landed.

00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,939
So, I want to make sure
I understand this,

00:34:33,939 --> 00:34:35,206
is instead of having
a showroom

00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:38,343
where you have your own
retail space, so to speak,

00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:40,412
your customers
are opening up their backyards?

00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,047
Exactly. Yeah, you got it.
Do I understand that right?

00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:43,214
You got that perfectly,
yeah.

00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:46,051
So, what do I get paid
for allowing that to happen?

00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:48,186
Yeah, so, we're testing that
right now,

00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:51,623
and, uh, you're expected to make
about $20 to $50 per visit.

00:34:51,623 --> 00:34:54,326
And the platform that we built,
you have to book a visit.

00:34:54,326 --> 00:34:56,861
You can't just show up to
somebody's home randomly, right?

00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:57,395
I get it.

00:34:57,395 --> 00:35:02,968
So, $750,000, 4% computes
$18.7 million.

00:35:02,968 --> 00:35:04,202
‐Good math.
‐Yeah.

00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:07,205
Why is this worth
$18‐plus million?

00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:08,540
So, Kevin, so,

00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,642
the outdoor furniture
market in the U. S.
is a $9 billion market.

00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:13,044
Oh, that's the worst answer!
No, don't go by that.
Don't go by that.

00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:14,279
Do you watch the show?

00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:16,147
That's a very bad thing
to say.

00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:18,149
Kevin, how big is the bankruptcy
market in the U. S.?

00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:19,184
It's really, really big.

00:35:19,184 --> 00:35:20,218
But go ahead, Jiake.

00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:23,088
Uh, we just launched
about four months ago,

00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:26,324
and we did about $800,000
in sales to date.

00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:28,193
But you haven't made
any money yet, have you?

00:35:28,193 --> 00:35:29,260
We're not
making money yet.

00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,862
Why $18 million?

00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:31,997
What's the reason?

00:35:31,997 --> 00:35:33,398
Yeah, um, so, we ‐‐

00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:35,333
First of all, we just closed
our last round

00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,801
with our
VC‐backed investment.

00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:37,335
At what valuation?

00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:39,170
That was
a $13.5 million valuation.

00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,439
So you came into the Shark Tank
and raised it even more?

00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:43,375
How much do you project
this year?

00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:46,077
This year, we're gonna close out
at least $1 million.

00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:47,312
Next year,
we're projecting $5 million.

00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:49,381
Greiner: So,
how many partners do you have,

00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:52,183
and what percentage
of the company do you two own?

00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:55,153
I own 60%,
Terry owns 25%,

00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,288
and my family factory
owns 15%.

00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:59,457
So, another answer
to the valuation

00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,426
is because it's actually
taking out

00:36:01,426 --> 00:36:02,594
the risk
on the supply chain.

00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:05,263
So, they're essentially
giving us this at cost, right?

00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:08,266
Your family is subsidizing you
by not taking a margin

00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:10,135
because they own 15%
of the business?

00:36:10,135 --> 00:36:11,336
That's right.
Interesting.

00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:14,039
And we don't have to pay for
the inventory until we sell it.

00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:17,308

You know, you're gonna...

00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:24,082
You only sold $800,000,
hopefully $1.5 million,

00:36:24,082 --> 00:36:27,352
and you're valuating
at over $18 million.

00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:30,288
You know exactly what's gonna
happen to you here, right?

00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:31,589

Wojcicki: So, for me,
coming from Silicon Valley,

00:36:34,459 --> 00:36:37,295
I'm used to seeing massive
valuations all the time,

00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:40,565
and, frankly, I've way overpaid
for a number of deals

00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:42,500
that I think can potentially
change the world

00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,202
or actually have
a huge impact.

00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,271
I don't think
it's world‐changing for me,

00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:50,575
so for that reason,
I'm out.

00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:53,144
Hey, guys, I think
it's a great business.

00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:54,379
Could it be
a $100 million business?

00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,147
Yeah, it really could be.

00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:57,449
But look at it from my end,
right?

00:36:57,449 --> 00:37:00,151
Let's just say you do
$200 million.

00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:02,387

You're making $20 million,
I'm making 5% of that.

I mean, that's not bad money,

Yeah, okay.

00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:03,468
All right, so, our counter
to Lori's offer

00:40:03,468 --> 00:40:06,604
is, um, $750,000 in loan,

00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:09,307
and royalty will pay back
to the $750,000,

00:40:09,307 --> 00:40:10,441
and on the equity side,
we would love

00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:11,542
to bring it down to 4%,

00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:13,711
what we asked for
when we came in.

00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:16,714
You want me to get up
every morning

00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:19,684
and be like, "I can't wait
to blow that up"?

00:40:19,684 --> 00:40:22,153
I mean,
you need that passion.

00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:22,687
You need that.

00:40:22,687 --> 00:40:25,456
And I'm worth it.
I'm worth it.

00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:27,392
Kevin's willing to do 5%,
$750,000.

00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,793
I think
that's really attractive.

00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:31,596
But we do want to work with you.
I feel that connection.

00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,631
So, is there any way
you can match that?

00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:34,933
We'll even throw in
the $1 million.

00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:37,535
So, it's $1 million paid back
to the royalty, but 5%.

00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:40,104
You want to raise
the royalty?

00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,472
Uh, the royalty ‐‐

00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,707
You want to kick up
the royalty

00:40:42,707 --> 00:40:44,542
and I'll go down
on the percentage?

00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:47,645
You can afford it, especially
with how many we'll sell.

00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,614
Uh, what's your offer
on the royalty?

00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:53,518
Well, why don't we go
to $30?

00:40:53,518 --> 00:40:56,521
$30 works?
I think $30 works.

00:40:56,521 --> 00:40:58,389
$30 works, 5%?
$30 up until $1 million?

00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:00,692
So, $750,000 as a loan.

00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:03,594
Okay.
I get $30 a chair

00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:05,596
until $1 million
is paid off.

00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:10,268
Okay.
We'll make it 3% interest
and 5% equity.

00:41:17,275 --> 00:41:18,343
Let's do it, Lori.
Let's do it.

00:41:18,343 --> 00:41:19,410
Yoo!

00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:20,611
Whoo!
That's good.

00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:22,947
This is so brilliant
in the outdoor space.

00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:24,582
Wait till you see
the other things that
we're coming up with.

00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:25,783
Honestly, it's brilliant.

00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:27,385
We're working on
so many more products.

00:41:27,385 --> 00:41:28,619
Cuban:
Congratulations, guys.
Thank you.

00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:29,721
Greiner: Why would you ever buy
anything else?
Congratulations.

00:41:29,721 --> 00:41:30,922
Thank you, guys.
Thank you so much.

00:41:30,922 --> 00:41:33,291
‐Congrats, guys.
‐Congratulations. Congrats.

00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:35,293
Wow.

00:41:35,293 --> 00:41:36,394
[ Laughs ]
Nice job.

00:41:36,394 --> 00:41:37,762
We're not trying to get
the best deal,

00:41:37,762 --> 00:41:39,664
we're trying to find
the right partnership.

00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:42,266
Kevin actually made
a better offer than Lori,

00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:42,867
at the end of the day,

00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:45,503
but, you know,
Lori definitely won us over

00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:48,139
because of that connection
that we felt with her.
