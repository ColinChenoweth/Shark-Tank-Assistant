our outfits are set up
for kits.

00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:58,450
So you'd pick a kit.

00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,519
It's usually based
on the jacket.

00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:04,523
We'd then hold that order
until you wanted to ski.

your first ski day.

How long does it take you

It depends on
when you're going.

minimum, before your ski trip.

are $18 up to $22.

that I've taught to ski,

part about having family

is outfitting those damn kids
every year with new stuff.

market it toward the children.

Yeah.

You know,
it's very much a 50/50.
You could come on my show
and get some wine.

00:41:12,017 --> 00:41:13,119
So, Bryan,
if that's the goal, right?

If you like that idea
of being on QVC and doing that,

it's not in my wheelhouse.

00:41:16,856 --> 00:41:17,990
For those reasons,
I'm out.

I'm not discounting
myself.

00:41:32,972 --> 00:41:34,840
Is there any way
you would work together?

00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,941
No.
No?

00:41:35,941 --> 00:41:37,209
That is not
the answer.

00:41:37,209 --> 00:41:38,277
O'Leary:
We don't need to.
