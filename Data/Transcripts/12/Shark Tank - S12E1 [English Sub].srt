was I had a need for someone
to come do my laundry

we sold a pair of shoes,

to a child in need.

00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:32,338
and so I sold half
of the company in 2014.

00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:35,241
Making small changes
in our lives

00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:36,776
can truly transform them.

00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:39,479
This led me on
a two‐year pilgrimage

00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:42,315
to meet some of the top
scientists in our country

00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:44,951
on the state of well‐being
and really thriving.

00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:47,820
This experience led to me
launching a new company,

00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,055
called Madefor.

00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,390
Our hope with Madefor

00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,126
is to teach everyone habits
and practices

00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:55,161
that can truly transform
their lives

00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:57,430
and help all of us
answer the question

00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,965
"What am I made for?"

00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,101
One of the things
I'm most excited about

00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,070
is competing
with the other Sharks.

00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,472
Most people know me
as this do‐gooder,

00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,341
but I'm really competitive.

Hi. I'm Chris.
And I'm Josh.

00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,717
And we're two of the co‐founders
of SparkCharge,

00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:53,719
based in Somerville,
Massachusetts.

00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,455
We're here today
seeking $1 million

00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,723
for a 6% stake
in our company.

00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:00,827
Everyone knows electric vehicles
are the future.

they'll be everywhere.

00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,165
But there's one major thing
keeping them

00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,701
from growing faster ‐‐
range anxiety.

00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:11,370
Range anxiety is the fear
of running out of charge

00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,939
in your electric vehicle.

00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:15,708
That's why I would love
to introduce you to the Roadie,

00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,176
the world's first
and only

00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:20,079
portable, modular,
and ultrafast EV charger.

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,782
The anxiety of finding
a charging station

00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:26,085
and the time wasted waiting
for a vehicle to charge

00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:27,954
simply goes away
when the charging station

00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:30,056
comes to <i>you,</i>
no matter where you are.

00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:31,858
The Roadie has
three core features.

00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:33,826
Number one ‐‐ modularity.

00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,394
Units can be
connected together

00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:36,929
to give
the electric vehicle owner

00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,664
the exact amount of range
they want.

00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,299
Number two ‐‐ portable.

00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,902
Our portable units
can charge an electric vehicle

00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:44,837
anytime and anywhere,

00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,306
making any location
a charging station.

00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:49,976
And, of course, the most
important factor ‐‐ speed.

00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:51,644
We can charge
an electric vehicle

00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:54,447
at a rate
of one mile every 60 seconds.

00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:57,116
So, Sharks, help us create
a more sustainable

00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,118
mobile EV charging
infrastructure.

00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,187
Okay, and walk us
through it.

00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,455
So, how would I
purchase that?

00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:03,856
John: Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,191
Wait. Wait one second.

00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,760

about this. I'm out.

[ Laughter ]

00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,531
Okay. Okay.
Thank you. Thank you.

00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,765
So, yeah,
it's really simple.

00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,867
So, we actually sell
directly to businesses.

00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,169
So we work with OEMs,
roadside companies,

00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,138
on‐demand companies,
and service companies.

00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:20,840
They use the hardware,
and they go out there

00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,175
and they charge electric vehicle
owners who request it.

00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,510
So AAA would carry this?

00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,112
Is AAA a customer
right now?

00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:28,047
We do have a program
going on right now.

00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,849
The question is,
how much does it cost you

00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:32,451
to make one of those
per module?

00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:33,519
What do you sell them for?

00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,154
So, per module,
our cost of goods

00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:37,223
are roughly around
$2,500,

00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,692
and then companies pay
a $1,000 deposit,

00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,994
and then we charge them
a 150‐buck monthly fee.

00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,330
Okay, so it's 150 bucks
per month per module.

00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,398
Yep.
Yes.

00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,999
In the past
six months alone,

00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,935
we've done close to over
half a million in sales,

00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:51,771
and we're on track
to do over $1 million
in sales this year alone.

00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:53,205
By end of next year,
we're predicting

00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:55,041
to do close
to $10 million in sales.

00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,810
This unit itself, it's patented
through and through.

00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,579
We developed it
from the ground up.

00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,614
We also built our own
manufacturing facility

00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:02,949
in Buffalo, New York.

00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:05,418
We've also been really strategic
with our funding,

00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:08,154
but we've won a lot of grants
and awards to get us there.

00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:10,256
How much money
have you raised from investors

00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,958
versus grants
that you received?

00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,594
I'd say we probably raised
about $3 million in venture,

00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,162
and the rest
has been about awards,

00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:17,663
which comes to about $2 million,
so about $5 million total.

00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:19,065
‐That's fabulous.
‐Very smart.

00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:21,567
And so what percentage of
the company do you guys own now

00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,169
versus what
the investors own?

00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:25,271
We have
a little over 50%.

00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,307
But why do you believe
you'll go to $10 million?

00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,509
You went from $500,000,
you double that ‐‐

00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,011
congratulations ‐‐
to $1 million,

00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:33,412
and now you're gonna
10x it.

00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:34,714
Why do you believe
you'll go to that?

00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:36,983
So, the electric vehicle
industry is growing rapidly.

00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:39,585
Essentially, the reason
that we're here today ‐‐
and that's a great point ‐‐

00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:41,420
is that we need to scale
to keep up with demand.

00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,755
O'Leary: Obviously,
you have to burn some cash

00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,190
to get to
where you are now.

00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,493
How much have you lost
to get to here?

00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,862
Since the beginning,
I think the burn rate is

00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,797
just a little over
about 4 mill.

00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,800
So you guys are in a bad spot
right now?

00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,302
No. No, we have runway.
No.

00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,937
You've raised
$4 million, right?

00:18:57,937 --> 00:18:59,438
We've raised
$5 million total.

00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,974
Okay, and you spent 4,
so you got a million left.

00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,310
Correct.
And in order to grow,

00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,479
you need to invest
to build more batteries.

00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,780
Correct.
O'Leary: Alright.

00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,915
You're basically leasing
these things to people, right?

00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,250
Correct.
Mm‐hmm.

00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,686
How much capital do I have
to tie up in inventory?

00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:15,354
That's probably the best way
to ask that question.

00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:16,856
About a third.

00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:22,294
You're basically going to carry
a third of revenue as leased.

00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,363
In other words, you own it.
It's on your balance sheet.

00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:28,000
Wouldn't it be better
to simply sell this

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,369
and then let the attrition occur
in the market?

00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,405
Because I think
that's a big issue.

00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:35,441
So, you know, we could sell it,
but by leasing it out,

00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:37,309
essentially,
we control the asset, and then

00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,378
when the batteries come back,
we can also repurpose them.

00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,514
Okay, so, tell me again
what it costs you to make.

00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:42,615
$2,500.

00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:45,518
And so
your payback time is...

00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:46,819
Approximately 12 months.

00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:48,187
How much are you charging, then,
if it's 12 months

00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,321
and if it's $150 a month ‐‐

00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,057
They pay
a $1,000 deposit.

00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:55,061
Oh, they pay $1,000...
Is it a deposit, or is it an
actual $1,000 of revenue?

00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:57,096
It's a $1,000 deposit.
It's nonrefundable.

00:19:57,096 --> 00:20:00,199
So it's not a deposit, then.
It's actually a $1,000 payment.

00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,434
Yes.

00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:03,302
Greiner: I really love
what you're doing here.

00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,304
And I also think that
you can have

00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:08,074
a direct‐to‐consumer end of this
down the road

00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:11,677
where they can put in their cars
something smaller

00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,746
but will give them
that little bit of peace of mind

00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:16,315
where they can get to somewhere
where they're safe.

00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,651
So, we are gonna be coming out
with a consumer product.

00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:20,920
The technology inside
is somewhat the same.

00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,756
It's just smaller size,
lighter package,

00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:25,191
more consumer‐friendly look.

00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:26,592
What will that retail for?

00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:29,195
Depending on scale, we might be
able to get it for under $1,500.

00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:31,597
How many units are being
used right now ‐‐ today?

00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:32,765
Around 50.
Yeah.

00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:34,266
50.
Oh, that's all?

00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,534
Only 50 units?

00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:36,869
You're backordered right now,
then?

00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:37,903
Yes.
Correct.

00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,705
I hate the lease part
of the deal.

00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:43,209
I hate owning risk.

00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:45,344
That part ‐‐
you lost me there.

00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:46,746
I'm out.

00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,214
Thank you, Kevin.
We appreciate it.
Thank you for your time.

00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:50,282
Like Lori,
I think the big opportunity

00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:53,252
is developing
a consumer unit,

00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,287
but I find it
really hard to believe

00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,256
that you're gonna deliver
a consumer unit

00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,924
for 1,000 bucks or less

00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,893
when your commercial units
are thousands.

00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:03,362
And so for that reason,
I'm gonna be out.

00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,966
Like I said,
I think it's super smart,

00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:08,400
it is innovative.

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,802
Mark is Mr. Technology.

00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:12,138
Like, I will always look to him
to understand things

00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:14,206
[ Laughing ] that I don't
actually understand.

00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:16,442
But this is more
a capital issue.

00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,577
So, are you interested,
Mark?

00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,246
'Cause I'll go in.
Yeah, I like the concept,
right?

00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:21,714
So, here's the challenge,
right?

00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:23,616
The challenge is
it's a lot of cash up front,

00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,584
and you're gonna have to
borrow money, not raise money,

00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,887
because if you raise more money,
then you guys aren't gonna have

00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:29,388

Yes. Of course.

Actually,
what happened is,

00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:41,206
in 2018, when we did 8.8,
$3 million of that

00:35:41,206 --> 00:35:43,642
was really just with
two large corporate accounts.

pretty much the exact thing

a good 15 companies

doing something similar
to what we're doing.

Whoa.
15. This is the big problem,
I think.

00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:58,423
Yeah.
Because, I mean, no disrespect
to the business right now,

00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:00,792
but to have this level
of valuation

00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:03,962
and have zero barriers to entry
and 15 competitors,

00:36:03,962 --> 00:36:06,564

as an investor.
