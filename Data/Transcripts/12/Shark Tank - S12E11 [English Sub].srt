We manufacture ourselves,
actually.

We have a unique process,

and so we kind of had to
scale it ourselves.

We talk to co‐packers,

00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,932
and we will continue
to speak with them as we grow.

00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:53,867
But so far, the quotes
they've given us

00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:55,535
have been
up to two times our cost.

00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:56,570
How do you make it?

00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,305
So we can tell you
it's not fried.

00:03:58,305 --> 00:03:59,473
That's the most
important part,

00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:01,341
but it is a proprietary
and novel process.

figured this out.

10 years ago.

with type 1 diabetes,

and I went from being a kid
who loved to snack all the time,

00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:14,421
didn't think about it,
to being somebody

00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,157
that had to watch every single
carb I put into my body.

00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:19,993
And I realized one day
those crispy pieces of egg white

00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,828
that coated the pan
when I made an omelet,

00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,463
they crunched
kind of like chips.

00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,398
I thought, "Hey, maybe I can
make a chip out of this."

00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,200
And that took myself ‐‐
That's a great call
right there,

is good.

called Nick up,

When we really got going
our sophomore year of college,

00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:44,317
I took one year off
of Williams College

00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,720
to basically get this product
from concept

I dropped out
of University of Chicago.

00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,289
We were in their
incubator program.

00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:24,391
We were actually
the only pre‐revenue brand

00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:25,992

to their incubator.

00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,295

...guys.

00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,700
Zack and Nick, 83 cents
cost of production per bag

00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,035
is pretty high.

00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:37,404
What's your ideal price point
that you're targeting?

00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:39,673
At the end of the day,
$1.99 a bag

00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,508
we think would be
the lowest we need to go.

00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,210
Well, you're definitely smart
to start higher,

00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,246
because once you start low,
you can never go up.

00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:48,682
But if you start high,
you can always go down.
Exactly.

00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:49,950
So who came up
with the name?

00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,052
We were thinking of "eggs"
in other languages.

00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:53,653
We thought of "huevos,"
and then someone's like,

00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,555
"Well, they're quick huevos.
They're eggs on the go."

00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:56,857
And so we combined
"quick" and "huevos."

00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,124
So it's Spanglish.
Yeah, it's cute.

00:05:58,124 --> 00:05:59,526
What about marketing?

00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,995
How much have you guys been
spending on marketing and where?

00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:05,532
So online we usually spend about
$20,000 a month on marketing.

00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,968
Last month,
we did $90,000 online sales.

00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:09,302
So we're seeing
a good return.

00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:12,873
Zack, I think you guys
probably two of the youngest,

00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,175
most impressive people
we've ever had out here.

00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:17,310
But I don't like the taste.

00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,912
I know you're
gonna do well.

00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:21,915
It's just not for me.
I'm out.

00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:23,250
Thank you so much, Robert.
No worries.

00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,417
O'Leary: I love this deal.

00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,453
I mean, the story ‐‐
the innovation

00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,922
from the fried eggs,
I love that.

00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:31,124
You're not loving the pricing.
I mean ‐‐

00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,592
No, I don't.
I tell you what.

00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,060
I'd structure
a little differently.

00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,030
In this case, I would
do this deal for $200,000

of 10 cents a bag

your brand the bigger it grows,

00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:17,604

will at some point

00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,782

pretty crazy.

it's worth it

to have you on board.

Our friend Kweku created
a solution that was so good

00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,920
that I had to
partner up with them.

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,657
And together, we both created
the one and only Brumachen.

that they're born.
Exactly.

00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:50,176
So, guys, your coffee pod,
you twist the top off,

00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,544
twist it in half.
And twist it in half.

00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:55,414
Then you take your coffee pod,
puncture it right in there.

Then take the nipple off.

00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,719

Tell me, how did you
come up with this?

00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:12,365
Well, I work construction.
I'm a civil engineer.

00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,966
So I was in a field
with the guys in the winter.

00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,601
And I live in Indiana.

00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,837
Construction guys, they're out
there in the freezing cold.

00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:20,306
And they had to go 10‐minute
drive to get a cup of coffee

00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:21,707
and come back
to the site.

00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,942
And that's like 20 minutes.

00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:25,211
If you multiply that
by 10 workers,

00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,380
you're spending a pretty buck
on coffee, you know.

00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,682
So my goal was,
how do you bridge in between

00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:31,717
having a coffee machine at home
and in an office?

00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,653
But when you're on the go
in between those spaces,

00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:36,022
your only option
is to buy.

00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:38,224
And I was like, we could make
something that could actually

00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:41,727
keep that self‐brewing feature
in coffee.

00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,930
So people can now do that
with our machine.

00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,064
How much is it?

00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,532
It's $120 retail.

00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:48,968

cost you to make?
$38.

00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:51,370
Do you have a patent?

pending

and the machine.

about how did you go
from Ghana to Indiana?

00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:58,811
Well, I grew up in Ghana.

00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:01,681
At 17, I graduated
from high school,

00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,849
and I decided I would chase
a career of civil engineering

00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,051
in the United States.

00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:07,553
So I kind of kissed
my family goodbye

00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:11,424
and I arrived in United States
with $2,000 in my pockets.

00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,726
I arrived on campus
in Cleveland State,

00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:16,395
and I ended up
working a job

00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:18,864
scrubbing toilets in the morning
at 5:30 a. m.

00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,866

to keep myself going.

00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,501

your role in this?

You're a social media
influencer?

of background about me.

00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:30,876

gotten billions of impressions

00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:33,813

45 million followers.

You look over here, my
94‐year‐old grandmother,
who's my co‐star,

your grandma?

00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:44,323
Not everything,
but she's my main star.

00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:47,860
So I have the ability to push
products and push people.

00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,629
And that's kind of why I'm here.
But what's your role
in the company?

00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,130
I'm marketing.
This is my brand.

00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,132
I'm using my social media
to back this.

00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,967

We sold 600 units
in January.

00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:07,480
Did you deliver
the Kickstarter units yet?
Yes, we have.

00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,981
You can tell it's designed
by an engineer

00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,517
because it's all built
around functionality

00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,986
as opposed to looks, right?
Yes.

00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,222
It looks a little bit
like a spaceship, right?

00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:18,157
I always say it looks
like a camera lens.

00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,692
And that's what's missing.

00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,894
You did how much in revenue
on your Kickstarter?

00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,162

00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,840
You think this is worth
$10 million?
Absolutely.

00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,209
Now I'm gonna rip you to pieces.
Are you out of your mind?

00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:38,577
Why would you think
this is worth $10 million?

00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,646
Well, because
just my push alone,

00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:43,115
I can get 100 million
impressions in a week on my own.

00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,316
You can buy those.
What does that have to do
with anything?

00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:45,985
And I can sell ‐‐
I've already sold products.

00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:47,353
Can I monetize
your impressions?

00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,488
Do I get money for that?
You sold $42,000 worth.

00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:50,756
No, because we haven't
done the push yet.

00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,958
That was just to see
if the practicality was good.

00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,427
Exactly ‐‐
I haven't even jumped on.

00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:56,462
I had a product last year
on e‐commerce

00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:58,097
that made $33,000.

00:19:58,097 --> 00:20:00,032
I brought it on.
$9 million this year.

00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,534
Cuban: Single‐serve,
take it with you,

00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,803
portable,
preserve the environment.

00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:05,204
That's all good.

00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,374
But like any product, it comes
down to the actual design.

00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,242
Like, I started playing with it,
and there's just

00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,912
too many moving pieces
that you had to explain.

00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:14,280
You're asking for $1 million,

00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,049
and you haven't really
shown us anything

00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,452
to say you deserve
$1 million.

00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:21,520
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,022
Appreciate that.
Appreciate that.

00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:27,226
I think it's a great product,
horrible design.

00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,295
But let's put all that aside
for a sec,

00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:32,231
because I love the concept,
I love you.

00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,201
$1 million for 10%.

00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:37,403
The challenge when you ask
for that kind of money

00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,472
and a $10 million valuation

00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:42,975
is you've gone out of the world
of belief and theory

00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,578
and now you're
in the world of proof.

00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:49,181
You have to give me proof
that it's worth that.

00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:52,485
It's ridiculous.
I'm out.

00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:55,788
You know what? It's still
an early‐stage prototype.

00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:57,456
There's still a long journey,

00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:59,625
so your valuation and the amount
of money you're asking

00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:00,760
is just very hard.

are great,

for $1 million for 10%,

sort of the same thing.

the velocity

is really going to hurt you.

might have to sell X cans,

00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:53,372

to help me run
one of his operations.

How much did he put in?

He put in,
as an angel investor,

5% for $60,000.

I was selling it for $10.

was very expensive ‐‐

‐Yes.

to $20, and people ‐‐

to make it?

How did you sell
that $15,000?

00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:20,485
Majority of it
came from organic sales

because when I did
a pre‐launch ‐‐

‐Online, yes.

Have you tried to go
into any retailers?

00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,559
I was approached
by a lot of retails,

00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:29,427
but I decided
not to go into retail

00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:32,197
because I wanted to make
the product even better.

00:35:32,197 --> 00:35:34,165
So I conducted
a market study.

00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:36,368
Everyone that had bought
the first version,

00:35:36,368 --> 00:35:37,802
I called them
and I asked them,

00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,237
how can I make
this product even better?

00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:41,673
Because my goal was to make
the best product I could.

00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:43,274

I don't want to go to retail"?
