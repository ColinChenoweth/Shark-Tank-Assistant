Greiner: It's like
a flaky pastry.

a lot of butter in this thing.

Andrea, tell us

How did you come up
with this magic?

00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,950
So I'm born and raised
in Venice, Italy,

00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:27,753
and I worked in the kitchen
as a chef since I was 16.

00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:30,056
And I moved to London
to learn English

00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:32,124
when I was 19 years old.

00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:35,328
And in London, I worked for one
of the fine Italian restaurants

00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,698
that is owned by one of the
largest private members clubs

00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:40,032
in ‐‐ in the world.

00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:41,934
Soho?
Soho House, yeah.

00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,836
And they gave me the opportunity
to move to New York

00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,806
in 2006 to open
one of their members' clubs.

00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:49,976
And I spent 10 years doing that
until I met Michelle.

00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:51,077
How did you meet Michelle?

00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:52,512
So we met through
a mutual friend,

00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,046
and it was really funny
because he asked me out

00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:55,414
on a pizza date.

00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,016
And I said, "Pizza date?

00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,918
No man has ever asked me out
for pizza."

00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:01,554
But the twist was he wanted
to teach me how to make pizza.

00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:03,556
I'm sure he did.

00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,925
I had to show off.
Yeah, he had to show off.

00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:08,160
And we've been married
for almost two years now.

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,496
And this is our first baby.
Congratulations.

00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:11,797
You know,
I was an event producer

00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,699
and then I worked
with social media influencers.

00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,035
Herjavec: And how did you go
from this incredible product

00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,104
you're making to actually
launching the business?

00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:19,405
Walk us through that.

00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:20,873
Actually, there was one event
that we did

00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,508
that it was for
our best friends.

00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,577
It was all a group
of Italian people,

00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:26,312
and everybody loved it.

00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:27,713
And, you know,
Italians are picky.

00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,883
So I was like ‐‐ we were afraid,
but they all loved it.

00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,053
And she, with her, you know,
background, she was like,

00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,755
"We need to bring this
to my events

00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:37,557
and see
what the reaction is."

00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,725
And that's how we started.
How do you sell it?

00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,761
Yeah, so ‐‐ so right now
we sell direct to consumer.

00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:44,230
But last year,
our three distribution channels

00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,998
were catering,
Smorgasburg,

00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:48,467
which is New York City's
most popular market.

00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,703
That gave us the street cred,
you know,

00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,572
to really have
that proof of concept.

00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,040
And then
we also did stadiums.

00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,842
So our first partnership
was with Citi Field,

00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:59,412
home of the New York Mets,
and they actually approached us.

00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,647
Did you get
a commercial kitchen involved?

00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,549
Yes, we produce
in a commercial kitchen,

00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:06,185
and we also have a co‐packer
who we've been working with

00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:07,853
for the last nine months.

00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:10,389
Lori, you might be familiar
with our co‐packer.

00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,091
We definitely
sought them out

00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,327
because their biggest client
is Bantam Bagel.

00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:17,597
‐Yeah.
‐What will sales be this year?

00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:20,700
So this year we're projecting
$800,000 in sales.

00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,834
‐Wow. Good for you.
‐Ooh, very nice.

00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:24,303
We did $344,000
in revenue last year.

00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:27,306
Year to date,
we've done $77,000.

00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:30,610
But we have a plan and we know
how to execute our plan.

00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,679
So, prior to COVID, we were
really a restaurant business.

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,782
And so because of
the seasonality of our business,

00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,619
we knew that we had
to launch e‐commerce.

00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,821
Direct to customer
frozen product.

00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:43,522
Correct. Yes,
direct to customer.
That's tough.

00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:44,824
We knew that was
in the roadmap,

00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:47,293
because currently
we're New York City‐based.

00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,295
Our customers are from
all around the country,

00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,497
and they wanted to know
where they could find us.

00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:54,233
I learned something with
Wicked Good Cupcakes.
Yes.

00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,602
The first royalty deal
in "Shark Tank" history

00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:59,805
just paid its millionth dollar
to me in royalties.

00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:00,973
Wow.
Fantastic.

00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,043
But the shipping journey
we took

00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:07,747
and the cost of the weight of
cupcake jars made of glass,

00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:10,282
we learned we had to sell six,
not three.

00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:11,784
Then we went to a dozen.

00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:14,387
Our goal right now is to find
a different fulfillment center

00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:16,756
who can serve us,
one in the Midwest,

00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:18,824
one in the Northeast,
and one in the South.
Greiner: Right.

00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,926
But what do you charge,
Michelle? What is this?

00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:24,030
12 come in this.
So a 12 pack is $24.99.

00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,165
And how much is shipping?
$9.99.

00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,868
35 bucks.
So $35 to get 12 pizzas.

00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:30,636
Correct, and ‐‐
Cuban:
It's 3 bucks a cupcake.

00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,371
What does it cost you
to make these?

00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:35,574
One cupcake is 95 cents
at the moment.

00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:36,709
That's expensive.
Yeah, that's expensive.
O'Leary: Wow.

00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,844
It is expensive because
we're making it by hand

00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,112
in our commercial kitchens.

00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:43,249
The recipe that we have
allow us to go

00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:45,084
to 48 cents per cupcake.

00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:46,752
And that's why we're here
for your investment

00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:48,788
so we can start production
with our co‐packer.

00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:50,022
You're starting up.

00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,058

yet, you know,

00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:53,859
how it's all
going to come together

00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,495
in terms of shipping
a frozen product.

00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,698
I think you're going to have
some significant challenges.

00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,066
There's no question about it.

00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:02,401
Good luck to you.

Here's where I'm at, guys.

00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:07,740
I'm not even going
to get into the valuation

00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,709
because you could
be optimistic.

00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,610
Really, I just think that

00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,446
I don't know
if I'd be the greatest partner.

00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:14,647
Soon as I saw this,
I was like,

00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,816
"This is Bantam Bagels
in another category."

00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:19,251
I know other people up here
who have stadiums

00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,220
and a bunch of buddies
with stadiums.

00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,022
Yeah, with no one
showing up right now.

00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:25,224
But they will sooner
or later, right?

00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,258
Eventually, yes.
Yes.

00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,294
So I really wish you
all the best,

00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:33,399
but in the best interest
of being a good Shark for you,

00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,167
I'm not the best partner
up here.

00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,368
I'm out.

00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:37,536

00:35:03,702 --> 00:35:06,338
that's designed to remove
the top of your canned beverage

00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:07,739
and turn it into a cup.

00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:09,407
Beer me, brochacho.

00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:12,310
Here's how it works.
Open the handle.

00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:16,181
Place Draft Top on the can.
Squeeze and rotate.

00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,720
O'Leary: Whoa.

00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,054
It's that easy.

00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:26,024
And not to mention the top
is removed from the inside rim,

00:35:26,024 --> 00:35:29,027
leaving...
Both: No sharp edges.

00:35:29,027 --> 00:35:31,997
So, Sharks,
who's ready to...

00:35:31,997 --> 00:35:34,866
drink topless?
Drink topless?

00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:36,301
Herjavec:
What am I doing wrong?

00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:37,736
Why can't I get this to work?

00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:39,104
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on. Hold on.

00:35:39,104 --> 00:35:40,271
We're gonna walk you
through that.

00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:43,141
So, in front of you,
we got a fancy version

00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,910
of the customized tools
for you.

00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:48,113
You can open it by pressing here
on top of the handle.

00:35:48,113 --> 00:35:49,214
Just pull it out like that?

00:35:49,214 --> 00:35:50,615
You got it.
Once in the open position,

00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:53,385
you're going to place
the tool on the can.

00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:55,587
Alright. You're going to
wiggle out just a little bit.

00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:57,055
Once you get on, you're going
to squeeze the handle

00:35:57,055 --> 00:35:58,823
just slightly until
the handle ‐‐

00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,291
the handle compresses.
Wait.

00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:03,595
Greiner: Aah!
It didn't work.

00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:05,664
John: Hold on, guys. Hold on.
We're having a little...
Did you get it to work?

00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,966
My problem is I'm crushing
the can while I'm doing it.

00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:09,234
It usually takes
a couple beers

00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:10,268
to get the ‐‐
get the trick down.

00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:11,703
It's too complicated.

00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:13,571
Well, I have a question
for you.
Sure.

00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:16,341
Obviously, it was a little
challenging here for us.

00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:18,209
I made a mess.
How many
have you sold?

00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:21,346
Yeah, so we've had the product
selling for eight months now,

00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:24,215
and we've sold $1.6 million.

00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:26,217
‐What?
‐Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:28,353
Selling over
70,000 units.

00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:30,388
Oh, now we're interested
in this.

00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:31,690
‐Alright. Now we're talking.
‐Seriously?

00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,359
So in December,
we did crowdfunding,

00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:37,729
and we did $835,000 in sales
on crowdfunding.

00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:38,930
John: Oh, there you go.
That's it.

00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:41,032
So this was our second time
on Kickstarter.

00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,201
Lifetime sales are a little
over $2 million.

00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,803
‐Hey, guys.
‐Yeah?

00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:46,938
So ‐‐ So ‐‐
Guys, look, I may be dumb,
but I'm not stupid, right?

00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:48,740
If I'm having
all this trouble,

00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,341
what were the reviews
on Kickstarter?

00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:51,810
What's the feedback?

00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,344
So we've had a lot
of great reviews

00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:55,580
and we've had others that didn't
necessarily feel as well.

00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,550
But what we've done is we know
there's a consumer ‐‐
You mean they're not so great.

00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,219
Yeah, but surprisingly,
not as much as you would think.

00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,489
But we put out a lot of content
on social media and YouTube

00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:07,058
where we have training videos
and stuff.

00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,861
Look, guys, I can see this being
a great gag gift,

00:37:09,861 --> 00:37:12,564
a great, you know,
groomsman gift,

00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:15,734
but at the end of the day,
I can't even get it to work.

00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:18,136
So we do tell the consumer there
is a bit of a learning curve.

00:37:18,136 --> 00:37:19,637
So there is
an expectation ‐‐

00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:21,840
Yeah, but listen ‐‐
listen to that. Listen to that.

00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,174
Listen to what
you're telling me.

00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:25,710
You're asking me
to waste a beer.

00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,579
And that is never tolerable.
So you don't actually need
to waste a beer.

00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:29,414
And for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:30,548
Mark, you don't need to
waste a beer.

00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:33,351
We tell people to ‐‐
to start with empties.

00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:34,486
So collect
a couple empties.

00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:36,121
Practice
with my empties?

00:37:36,121 --> 00:37:37,756
Yeah, absolutely.
It works the same way.
There you go. Well...

00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:40,258
You sold $2 million
worth of it.

00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,326
That's serious money, okay?

00:37:41,326 --> 00:37:42,360
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,029
My question is why?

00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:46,531
Why does
the world need this?
Alright.

00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:50,001
It's ‐‐ It's a fun item,
but it's not worth $3 million.

00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:52,704
Guys. Guys, I‐I've tried
four times now.

00:37:52,704 --> 00:37:55,173
I tried it slowly.
I took the thing down.

00:37:55,173 --> 00:37:57,909
I h‐held it.
I put on the thing.

00:37:57,909 --> 00:37:59,577
I can't get it to work.
I'm out.

But it ‐‐ it's such
a pain in the heinie.

look at it and say,

00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:18,530

flexibility on valuation?"

is inventory, right?

We can't keep up through
the website right now.

00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:01,639

in the last three weeks

can't make it fast enough.

no matter what percent,

was the 300K.

So, Kevin, we are on target to
do $3.2 million conservatively.

00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,350
We think we'll be at $4 million
by the end of the year.

00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,538
‐Cheers!
‐Outstanding.

00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:49,307
Greiner: Congrats.

00:41:49,307 --> 00:41:51,609
Well, didn't exactly go
as expected,

00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:52,844
but that was pretty good.

00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:53,878
Cheers.

00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:56,447
Daymond,
it doesn't work.

00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:57,949
It does work.
Look at mine.

00:41:57,949 --> 00:41:59,117
Let's see if
Mark can do it.

00:41:59,117 --> 00:42:00,184

00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,387
You hear that?
You hear that?

00:42:02,387 --> 00:42:04,255
You're crushing the can.
Greiner: Keep going. Keep going.

00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:06,157
You hear that?
You're crushing the can.

00:42:06,157 --> 00:42:08,760
Crushing the can.
Is it off? No.

00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,361
Yes, it is.
Crushing the can.

00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,397
But you had to push it in.
That's the way you do it.

00:42:12,397 --> 00:42:14,065
You don't lift it out?
No.

00:42:14,065 --> 00:42:16,167
Oh, you push it down.
Why didn't I push it in?

00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:17,335
Ohh.

00:42:17,335 --> 00:42:19,370
John: Yeah, you push it down.
Mine worked.
