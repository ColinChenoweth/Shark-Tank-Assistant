jewelry brand Kendra Scott,

00:00:05,394 --> 00:00:06,628
returns to the Tank.

00:00:06,628 --> 00:00:07,696
I'm sitting
in front of you,

00:00:07,696 --> 00:00:10,932
somebody who built
a billion‐dollar brand

00:00:10,932 --> 00:00:12,768
out of their extra bedroom
of their house.

00:00:12,768 --> 00:00:15,670
I have just enough cash
in the bank to make it 30 days,

00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:16,671
or we're out of business.

00:00:16,671 --> 00:00:18,240
Oh.
You have picked a sector

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,208
that it's almost impossible
to make money in.

00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:21,743
I want 20%
of the company.

00:00:21,743 --> 00:00:23,111
What a savage.

00:00:23,111 --> 00:00:25,447
I am going to offer you
my golden ticket.

00:00:25,447 --> 00:00:26,681
‐Whoo!
‐Oh!

00:00:26,681 --> 00:00:29,184
Find a nice barn,
and just go shoot it.

00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:32,287
I always love it when somebody
tells me I can't do something.

00:00:32,287 --> 00:00:34,856
So take that
and use it as fire.

Hi, Sharks.
My name is Haley Pavone,

00:01:00,749 --> 00:01:03,418
and I'm from
San Luis Obispo, California.

00:01:03,418 --> 00:01:06,121
Today, I'm seeking
a $500,000 investment

00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:09,958
in exchange for 5%
of my game‐changing company,

00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:11,226
Pashion Footwear.

00:01:11,226 --> 00:01:13,061
It's a tale as old as time.

00:01:13,061 --> 00:01:15,263
A woman puts on
her favorite pair of heels

00:01:15,263 --> 00:01:18,767
and heads out to work, out to
a wedding, or out for the night.

00:01:18,767 --> 00:01:20,936
She is absolutely
crushing her commute,

00:01:20,936 --> 00:01:24,806
tearing up that dance floor,
and looking her absolute best...

00:01:24,806 --> 00:01:26,408
for exactly 45 minutes.

00:01:26,408 --> 00:01:28,143
Suddenly,
her feet are on fire,

00:01:28,143 --> 00:01:31,413
and she is regretting everything
about her shoe choice.

00:01:31,413 --> 00:01:35,150
So I invented the ultimate
solution to high‐heel pain

00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,485
and inconvenience ‐‐

00:01:36,485 --> 00:01:39,788
the world's first
fully convertible high heels.

00:01:39,788 --> 00:01:42,357
Now, not that I'm not
totally crushing this outfit,

00:01:42,357 --> 00:01:45,594
but let me slip into something
just a little more comfortable.

00:01:45,594 --> 00:01:47,729
With a quick twist
of the wrist,

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:50,098
our stylish high heels
turn into comfortable

00:01:50,098 --> 00:01:52,868
and practical flats
just like that.

00:01:52,868 --> 00:01:54,169
Corcoran: Wow.
Want to see me do it again?

00:01:54,169 --> 00:01:57,572
Yes, we do.
That's impressive.

00:01:57,572 --> 00:01:59,908
Whew!
That is so much more comfy.

00:01:59,908 --> 00:02:01,576
Here at Pashion,
we are determined

00:02:01,576 --> 00:02:03,311
to make traditional
high heels,

00:02:03,311 --> 00:02:06,248
and all their ridiculous
problems, a thing of the past.

00:02:06,248 --> 00:02:08,517
Now, Sharks,
who's ready to majorly disrupt

00:02:08,517 --> 00:02:10,519
the massive women's
footwear market

00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:12,220
and take the next step
of this journey

00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,789
in some awesome
convertible high heels?

00:02:14,789 --> 00:02:17,526
That's remarkable.
Now, I actually do have samples
for each of you.

00:02:17,526 --> 00:02:19,361
They're in your size.
Oh, good.

00:02:19,361 --> 00:02:21,530
You know
I love a good nude heel.

00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,198
Way to go, Haley.
There we go. Fantastic.

00:02:23,198 --> 00:02:24,699
Part of our key innovation

00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:26,801
is we use completely
different materials

00:02:26,801 --> 00:02:29,204
from any other high heel
in our midsole.

00:02:29,204 --> 00:02:30,739
They're totally flexible.

00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:33,575
When you have no body weight,
it looks like it has an arch,

00:02:33,575 --> 00:02:35,877
but the second you step down,
goes completely flat.

00:02:35,877 --> 00:02:37,512
So, I pop the heel off.

00:02:37,512 --> 00:02:40,415
Okay, now, am I supposed to
also remove something

00:02:40,415 --> 00:02:43,285
from right here?
Yes, you're removing
this sole‐support portion.

00:02:43,285 --> 00:02:45,053
Just grab it, turn,
and then pull out.

00:02:45,053 --> 00:02:46,621
There you go.
Ah, okay,
the whole piece is off.

00:02:46,621 --> 00:02:48,390
Yes. And that part
that you took out just there,

00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,925
that's the removable
sole support.

00:02:49,925 --> 00:02:52,227
That's really
the essence of our I. P.

00:02:52,227 --> 00:02:54,596
There have been
removable heels before...
Yes.

00:02:54,596 --> 00:02:56,331
...but no one's ever innovated
on a removable sole.

00:02:56,331 --> 00:02:57,866
So I'm going
to stand up on this.

00:02:57,866 --> 00:03:00,936
Ooh, wow.
It's, like, bouncy.

00:03:00,936 --> 00:03:04,205
Yeah, so to put them back on,
you just hook this bit here,

00:03:04,205 --> 00:03:06,207
pop it back in,
give it a twist,

00:03:06,207 --> 00:03:08,610
it'll click, and you're locked
back into place.

00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,212
Gotcha.
So I am assuming

00:03:11,212 --> 00:03:13,982
that you have sold
quite a few of these.
We have, yes.

00:03:13,982 --> 00:03:15,584
So, it's been a year
and some change,

00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,719
and we've done a little over
$800,000 in sales.

00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:19,087
Wow.
Now, that's impressive.

00:03:19,087 --> 00:03:20,822
What about returns?
And what are
the returns like?

00:03:20,822 --> 00:03:24,893
Yep.
So our return
and exchange percentage is 24%.

00:03:24,893 --> 00:03:27,896
24%?
Yes, the footwear average,
though, is 20%

00:03:27,896 --> 00:03:30,465
just because the sizing
for footwear is so difficult

00:03:30,465 --> 00:03:33,201
to make perfect online.
And your sales are net sales
after all returns?

00:03:33,201 --> 00:03:37,105
No, net sales ‐‐ $500,000.
$500,000. Okay, so ‐‐

00:03:37,105 --> 00:03:39,341
Every woman I know
hates her high heels,

00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:41,209
every one of them,
and can't walk in them

00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:42,510
for more than
three or four hours.

00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,412
Why was it you who said,

00:03:44,412 --> 00:03:46,114
"Let me do something
about this"?

00:03:46,114 --> 00:03:47,849
So, in my sophomore year
of college,

00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:49,784
I was out at
a sorority spring formal,

00:03:49,784 --> 00:03:52,554
and I'd worn six‐inch high
heels, as college girls do.

00:03:52,554 --> 00:03:54,856
But high heels
when you're trying to dance

00:03:54,856 --> 00:03:56,291
are not comfortable.

00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,593
It's really more of a wobble,
and I wanted to bust a move.

00:03:58,593 --> 00:04:00,829
So I ditched my high heels...
[ Laughs ]

00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:02,664
...and took to
the dance floor barefoot.

00:04:02,664 --> 00:04:05,734
Unfortunately,
tragedy and inspiration

00:04:05,734 --> 00:04:07,202
quite literally struck.

00:04:07,202 --> 00:04:09,704
One of the other young women
accidentally stomped

00:04:09,704 --> 00:04:10,939
her stiletto
through my foot...

00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:12,440
Oh.
...and impaled me
through the toe.

00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,242
Oh, my God.
O'Leary: Through the ‐‐
Are you kidding?

00:04:14,242 --> 00:04:15,910
Through the toe, yes.
Like, right through?

00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,646
Like, clean through.
This is a terrible story.

00:04:17,646 --> 00:04:19,414
And as I'm sitting on the side
of the dance floor,

00:04:19,414 --> 00:04:23,151
it struck me as odd that there
is this societal expectation

00:04:23,151 --> 00:04:26,054
for women to wear high heels to
formal or professional events.

00:04:26,054 --> 00:04:28,423
Everyone knows they hurt
and that they're inconvenient,

00:04:28,423 --> 00:04:30,258
and yet there is no solution.

00:04:30,258 --> 00:04:33,662
So, Haley, how have you gotten
your $500,000 in net sales?

00:04:33,662 --> 00:04:36,331
We are all online,
and we've been able to sell

00:04:36,331 --> 00:04:39,634
through digital marketing, P. R.,
and then also word of mouth.

00:04:39,634 --> 00:04:42,203
Haley,
you are super impressive.
Thank you.

00:04:42,203 --> 00:04:43,705
I want to hear your background
a little bit.

00:04:43,705 --> 00:04:45,874
Yes, absolutely.
So, when I was in college,

00:04:45,874 --> 00:04:48,209
I already was very much
in the headspace of,

00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:50,879
when I graduate,
I want to be working for myself.

00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:53,148
And so after
that impalement incident...
[ Chuckles ]

00:04:53,148 --> 00:04:56,384
...I dove in headfirst, started
pitching at different events,

00:04:56,384 --> 00:04:59,320
and actually raised
the first $26,500,

00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,257
and I actually got the first
working salesman samples

00:05:02,257 --> 00:05:04,726
the day before
my college graduation.

00:05:04,726 --> 00:05:05,760
‐Wow!
‐Wow! That's great.

00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,162
So they got
their first break‐in.

00:05:07,162 --> 00:05:09,097
Were you wearing your shoes
in that graduation picture?

00:05:09,097 --> 00:05:10,598
Yes, absolutely.
And luckily,

00:05:10,598 --> 00:05:13,568
I'd actually built the company
up enough at this point

00:05:13,568 --> 00:05:16,037
that when I graduated,
I was able to come on full‐time.

00:05:16,037 --> 00:05:17,839
I brought on
a footwear‐development team,

00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,140
hired on a COO,

00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,342
brought on a lot
of student volunteers, actually.

00:05:21,342 --> 00:05:24,012
All with $26,000?
Wow.
Yes. Initially.

00:05:24,012 --> 00:05:25,380
We have raised more
since then.

00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,449
Who owns your company now?
What's your cap table look like?

00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:28,650
I own my company right now.

00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,685
So, we've raised a total
of $2.5 million to date.

00:05:30,685 --> 00:05:31,553
Oh!
Scott: Wow!

00:05:31,553 --> 00:05:32,821
Corcoran: How much?
Whoa!

00:05:32,821 --> 00:05:35,457
$2.5 million,
all on convertible notes.

00:05:35,457 --> 00:05:37,726
So right now, I own
83% of the company.

00:05:37,726 --> 00:05:38,860
But after they convert?

00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,595
It depends, obviously,
on valuation.

00:05:40,595 --> 00:05:43,098
But for instance, if you were
to take my deal today,

00:05:43,098 --> 00:05:44,899
I would be at 45%.

00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:47,836
Oh, and you know that we're
going to have to negotiate,

00:05:47,836 --> 00:05:49,537
and so you're going to
end up owning,

00:05:49,537 --> 00:05:52,574
if you get a deal,
less than 45%.

00:05:52,574 --> 00:05:55,343
But I'm going to own a little
less of a much larger company

00:05:55,343 --> 00:05:57,245
with the help of a fabulous
Shark, right?
Which I'm always
a fan of,

00:05:57,245 --> 00:05:59,447
but how much cash
do you have left in the bank?

00:05:59,447 --> 00:06:01,683
Right now,
we have about $250,000.

00:06:01,683 --> 00:06:02,650
Ooh!
Yes.

00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,018
How much inventory
do you have?

00:06:04,018 --> 00:06:06,454
Right now, I have $150,000
worth of inventory at cost.

00:06:06,454 --> 00:06:07,922
What's your monthly burn?

00:06:07,922 --> 00:06:11,025
Our monthly burn right now is
about $90,000 before marketing.

00:06:11,025 --> 00:06:12,093
Ouch.

00:06:12,093 --> 00:06:14,696
Your burn is
$90,000 a month?
Yes.

00:06:14,696 --> 00:06:16,898
So you have
three months...
Mm‐hmm.

00:06:16,898 --> 00:06:19,000
...of cash left?
Yes.

00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,202
But, that being said, I've been
in this situation before,

00:06:21,202 --> 00:06:22,537
and I did get out of it.

00:06:22,537 --> 00:06:23,805
Something you should know
about me

00:06:23,805 --> 00:06:26,074
is I'm one of the most resilient
people you'll ever meet.

00:06:26,074 --> 00:06:28,109
Back in 2019,
we were in a situation

00:06:28,109 --> 00:06:32,147
where I found us $80,000 in debt
and I realized,

00:06:32,147 --> 00:06:35,016
"Okay, I have just enough cash
in the bank

00:06:35,016 --> 00:06:37,452
to make it 30 days,
or we're out of business."

00:06:37,452 --> 00:06:40,255
And so
I hit the ground running.

00:06:40,255 --> 00:06:42,857
I pitched every single person
that would listen,

00:06:42,857 --> 00:06:45,660
and I closed a million‐dollar
deal on the 30th day.

00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,295
And that's why we're still
in business today.

00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:50,732
So, yes, it's a scary situation,
but I believe in this too much

00:06:50,732 --> 00:06:52,567
to ever let it fail,
and I will get out of it.

00:06:52,567 --> 00:06:57,038
You don't really want to give up
more than 5% here.

00:06:57,038 --> 00:06:58,506
I mean,
I appreciate the value

00:06:58,506 --> 00:06:59,874
that a Shark brings
to the table.

00:06:59,874 --> 00:07:03,011
Alright, look, I would make you
an offer that looks like this.

00:07:03,011 --> 00:07:06,114
I give you the $500,000
for 5%.

00:07:06,114 --> 00:07:08,049
However,
I get paid a royalty

00:07:08,049 --> 00:07:11,920

doing everything themselves,

Michelle: Thanks, Jerry.

00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:28,202
So, if you look at them,
there's a sturdy rim,

00:17:28,202 --> 00:17:30,304
and so in each rim
there is steel

00:17:30,304 --> 00:17:32,640
so you have confidence
walking to the freezer.

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,141
Right, you fill it up
with your food,

00:17:34,141 --> 00:17:36,043
and then there's no way
the tray is going to fold

00:17:36,043 --> 00:17:38,512
or collapse on you
when you take it to the freezer.

00:17:38,512 --> 00:17:42,349
The plastic lid that you
put on top is very firm.

00:17:42,349 --> 00:17:44,418
And so you can actually
stack them

00:17:44,418 --> 00:17:47,221

in the freezer.

00:17:47,221 --> 00:17:48,889

sell for $19.95 retail.

8% of our sales
come from our own website,

00:18:57,525 --> 00:19:02,263

come from our retail partners.

I built my business that way.
I mean, I got into Nordstrom.

00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:14,208
I had no money for marketing.

00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,443
Nordstrom said
they liked Kendra Scott,

00:19:16,443 --> 00:19:18,746
and that immediately gave me,

00:19:18,746 --> 00:19:21,015
you know, something to stand on,
because if they believed in me,

00:19:21,015 --> 00:19:23,017
one of the top retailers
in the world,

00:19:23,017 --> 00:19:24,919
it was able to allow me
to build my business,

00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:27,021
and that business
fed to my online,

00:19:27,021 --> 00:19:29,490
which is, like, the best,
so I think that's really smart

00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:32,192
to still have some
very key wholesale partners.

We're looking for mentorship
from the Sharks.

00:19:37,865 --> 00:19:40,768
I think some of the things that
we've realized as we've grown

00:19:40,768 --> 00:19:42,836
is there are kind of
some bigger decisions

00:19:42,836 --> 00:19:44,805
that we struggle
to make decisions on.

00:19:44,805 --> 00:19:48,142
So, there was an opportunity
to potentially sell

00:19:48,142 --> 00:19:50,244
to a very large retailer,

00:19:50,244 --> 00:19:51,845

for Souper Cubes.

hard time thinking,

"Well, what would our
other retailers think?"
Cuban: Yeah.

that I needed to do
something different,

00:28:15,549 --> 00:28:19,753
I did halt on any launch,
any sales.

00:28:19,753 --> 00:28:22,889

$6,000 in preorders

and then about
another $4,000

00:28:24,691 --> 00:28:27,194
of just people
that just found us randomly.

00:28:27,194 --> 00:28:28,595
And I'll be honest,
at the beginning,

00:28:28,595 --> 00:28:29,763
I would send them out

quite a few returns.

is I found out

that there's other ways
to sell online.

Mm‐hmm.

00:29:11,204 --> 00:29:14,908

they could never guess right

how many of each SKU
for each size.

00:29:17,544 --> 00:29:19,813
So they always were stuck
with doing limited runs,

00:29:19,813 --> 00:29:21,648
which costs the fabric
much more.

00:29:21,648 --> 00:29:23,817

experience,

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,256
I feel like it's not the kind
of business that has room

00:29:29,256 --> 00:29:31,124
for a third partner anyway.

00:29:31,124 --> 00:29:33,693
And for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:29:33,693 --> 00:29:36,396
So, what does it cost you
to create this suit?

00:29:36,396 --> 00:29:37,831
And what are you
selling it for?
Yep.

00:29:37,831 --> 00:29:39,332
So, they cost between ‐‐

00:29:39,332 --> 00:29:42,035
Originally, they cost
between $29 and $35.

00:29:42,035 --> 00:29:43,503
To make?
To make.

00:29:43,503 --> 00:29:45,505
To <i>make?</i>
And we've experimented
with the retail price.

00:29:45,505 --> 00:29:46,840
Small batch.
Very small batch.
Scott: Right.

00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,341
We'd like to get the cost
of goods down somewhere

00:29:48,341 --> 00:29:50,310
in that ballpark
of 16 to 20 bucks.

00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,778
Okay, and you sell it
for...?

00:29:51,778 --> 00:29:53,847
We sell it for ‐‐
So, this is the other thing.

00:29:53,847 --> 00:29:55,749
This last year,
I've been testing prices.

00:29:55,749 --> 00:29:58,885
So, I did start ‐‐
we did like $59 to $120.

00:29:58,885 --> 00:30:00,387
Just to dabble
and see what hits.
And what I found out

00:30:00,387 --> 00:30:04,157
was the younger women would
gear more towards that $59,

00:30:04,157 --> 00:30:07,494
and then the older demographic,
the 40‐plus,

00:30:07,494 --> 00:30:09,896
that demographic
is willing to pay.

It's adorable,
and you're fabulous,

investment for me.

to speak to the buttons
or not buttons,

00:30:24,644 --> 00:30:27,514
but what I <i>can</i> speak to is,
in this environment,

00:30:27,514 --> 00:30:29,182
where people
are staying at home,

00:30:29,182 --> 00:30:32,652
people want to be interactive
and have that personal touch

00:30:32,652 --> 00:30:34,521
and be guided through
a selection,

00:30:34,521 --> 00:30:35,956
particularly like this.

00:30:35,956 --> 00:30:37,290
Absolutely.
That's your grand slam.

00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,491
Yep.
Right?

00:30:38,491 --> 00:30:40,427
Because you don't have to sink
all your money

00:30:40,427 --> 00:30:41,995
into all that inventory

00:30:41,995 --> 00:30:44,965
if you can just brag,
"I'm the swimsuit whisperer.

Let me get online with you
on a Zoom call,

00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,835

And then once you get

00:30:48,835 --> 00:30:51,805
a base of customers
who can refer other customers,

00:30:51,805 --> 00:30:54,808
then someone is gonna come
to you and say, "You know what?

of barns in Iowa.

was a hat company,

was gonna wear hats again

That didn't happen.

00:31:47,994 --> 00:31:50,897

to make this business work,

I failed. Right?

that <i>was</i> working,

was selling every day.

00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:39,018
That's a lot of sauce.
[ Laughing ] Yes.

00:36:39,018 --> 00:36:41,287
Where are you manufacturing?
What are we looking at

00:36:41,287 --> 00:36:43,423
from your cost of goods
to where you're selling it?

00:36:43,423 --> 00:36:46,092
Yes. So, currently, we
are manufacturing in Houston.

00:36:46,092 --> 00:36:47,760
Our retail price
for our product

00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,430
is $9.95 online.

00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,432
Greiner: Now, I have to go back
for a minute.

00:36:52,432 --> 00:36:53,933
You said
you were 16 years old?

00:36:53,933 --> 00:36:55,969
Yes, I created the sauce
when I was 8.

00:36:55,969 --> 00:36:58,905
So, finally, my mom said
I could bottle it.

00:36:58,905 --> 00:37:01,808
So I initially started
the company when I was 14,

00:37:01,808 --> 00:37:03,610
and we started
with a wing place.

00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:05,778
So we sold wings
out of our house

00:37:05,778 --> 00:37:07,547
for a whole year,

00:37:07,547 --> 00:37:09,716
and we made $50,000

00:37:09,716 --> 00:37:11,184
selling the wings
out of our house.

00:37:11,184 --> 00:37:12,652
That's what's up!
That's awesome.

00:37:12,652 --> 00:37:13,853
That is incredible.

00:37:13,853 --> 00:37:18,091
And then end of 2018
is when we actually started

00:37:18,091 --> 00:37:19,592
selling the sauce.

00:37:19,592 --> 00:37:21,761
And so, with that,
we stopped the wing place

00:37:21,761 --> 00:37:22,795
and we were like,

00:37:22,795 --> 00:37:24,464
"Since you guys love
our wings so much,

00:37:24,464 --> 00:37:26,733
you buy our sauce
and you make it yourself.

00:37:26,733 --> 00:37:28,735
And not only is it good
for wings, but you can use it

00:37:28,735 --> 00:37:30,036
on all of these
amazing foods, as well."

00:37:30,036 --> 00:37:31,537
Corcoran: I don't get
why you stopped it, though.

00:37:31,537 --> 00:37:34,641
Why stop it if it was dragging
customers in to try your sauce?

00:37:34,641 --> 00:37:36,576
So, when she was ready
to bring the sauce to market,

00:37:36,576 --> 00:37:39,178
the smarter thing for us to do
in our business model

00:37:39,178 --> 00:37:41,214
was to bottle
the sauce first.

00:37:41,214 --> 00:37:43,249
It was the best way
to get her started,

00:37:43,249 --> 00:37:45,318
because we couldn't afford
at the time

00:37:45,318 --> 00:37:47,053
to put the money
into a brick‐and‐mortar

00:37:47,053 --> 00:37:49,255
or food trucks.
But we still have that base.

00:37:49,255 --> 00:37:50,456
We still have
that customer base,

00:37:50,456 --> 00:37:51,257
and they still love us.

00:37:51,257 --> 00:37:52,959
You said 68 stores.
Yes.

00:37:52,959 --> 00:37:54,961
So, currently,
we are in Wegmans.
Yeah.

00:37:54,961 --> 00:37:56,295
Okay.
Greiner: Oh, wow.

00:37:56,295 --> 00:37:57,597
That's a big accomplishment.

00:37:57,597 --> 00:37:59,932
Yes, so we're in 10 stores
on the East Coast in Wegmans.

00:37:59,932 --> 00:38:01,434
We're a test market
with the ‐‐

00:38:01,434 --> 00:38:03,603
Tyla, you're amazing.
Thank you.

00:38:03,603 --> 00:38:05,605
How are you 16?
This is incredible.

00:38:05,605 --> 00:38:09,308
Were you at 8 years old going,
"I want to make products"?

00:38:09,308 --> 00:38:12,078
So, it kind of came from me
watching this show.

00:38:12,078 --> 00:38:15,348
And when I was 8 years old,
me and my mom,

00:38:15,348 --> 00:38:18,117
we had just came
from being homeless.

00:38:18,117 --> 00:38:20,319
And we moved into
this one‐bedroom apartment,

00:38:20,319 --> 00:38:21,988
and I started watching
"Shark Tank."

00:38:21,988 --> 00:38:24,223
And that's when I started

00:38:24,223 --> 00:38:26,392
seeing entrepreneurship
as an option.

00:38:26,392 --> 00:38:29,696
And as I got older and was
finding out more about myself,

00:38:29,696 --> 00:38:32,632
I decided that entrepreneurship
should be the route for me,

00:38:32,632 --> 00:38:34,133
and I started
my business.
That's awesome.

00:38:34,133 --> 00:38:36,602
And through our company,
we actually give back a lot.

00:38:36,602 --> 00:38:38,337
I knew that
me selling sauce

00:38:38,337 --> 00:38:40,239
would be an inspiration
to the youth.

00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:43,009
And that's why I speak
almost four times,

00:38:43,009 --> 00:38:45,111
three times a month,
speaking to the youth

00:38:45,111 --> 00:38:48,014
and telling them that
entrepreneurship is an option.

00:38:48,014 --> 00:38:49,348
Corcoran: Amazing.
Greiner: Wow.

00:38:49,348 --> 00:38:51,884
I mean, Monique, you must be
beaming with pride.

00:38:51,884 --> 00:38:53,720
Good for you.
That's awesome.
Monique:
I am beyond proud.

00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,455
She inspires me
every day.
Corcoran: Of course.

00:38:55,455 --> 00:38:57,256
And I'm just always
in awe with her.

00:38:57,256 --> 00:38:58,991
So, yes.

00:38:58,991 --> 00:39:01,561
When you went homeless
for a period of time,

00:39:01,561 --> 00:39:02,929
how did that happen?

00:39:02,929 --> 00:39:07,100
So, we were actually living
in a very nice brownstone.

00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,235
And the woman who was
renting it to us,

00:39:09,235 --> 00:39:11,070
her son was coming home.

00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,705
She wanted the house
for him.

00:39:12,705 --> 00:39:15,274
And so we had to leave,
and at that time,

00:39:15,274 --> 00:39:17,510
my mom,
she didn't have a job.

00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,178
And she made a promise
to me, like,

00:39:19,178 --> 00:39:21,280
that we would never
be homeless again.

00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,349
And that just really taught me
about her hustle,

00:39:23,349 --> 00:39:26,919
because she sold baskets
for baby showers,

00:39:26,919 --> 00:39:29,021
anything that she could
possibly do.

00:39:29,021 --> 00:39:30,790
Way to go.
And then when we got
the apartment,

00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:34,427
she got a waiter job
right by my school.

00:39:34,427 --> 00:39:36,929
So every day she could come
pick me up from school,

00:39:36,929 --> 00:39:38,431
and I would sit there
and wait

00:39:38,431 --> 00:39:40,433
until she got off of work
and do my homework.

00:39:40,433 --> 00:39:42,735
And that's how we were able
to keep the apartment.

00:39:42,735 --> 00:39:44,871
‐That's unbelievable.
‐Wow. What an amazing mom.

00:39:44,871 --> 00:39:46,072
Thank you.
Yes. Thank you.

00:39:46,072 --> 00:39:47,874
O'Leary: So, the great news
about this sector

00:39:47,874 --> 00:39:50,209
is the condiments
and the sauce business

00:39:50,209 --> 00:39:51,811
is in the billions
of dollars.

00:39:51,811 --> 00:39:54,180
The bad news is
it's really competitive.

00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,616
Right.
And so to get
national rollout,

00:39:56,616 --> 00:40:00,186
you have to be working with
a distributor in this category.

00:40:00,186 --> 00:40:01,854
That's why we're here.
We're here for a Shark.
Yeah.

00:40:01,854 --> 00:40:04,624

the call, it's gonna happen.

I am the Shark for you.

One, I'm a Texas girl.

00:40:11,697 --> 00:40:14,267
Two, my first employee
was my mom.

00:40:14,267 --> 00:40:17,270
And my mom and I sat
and ticketed and carded jewelry

00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:18,604
on my dining room table,

00:40:18,604 --> 00:40:21,641
and we put every dollar we made
back into that business.

00:40:21,641 --> 00:40:23,576

your $100,000,

I wouldn't offer you that.

I'm not sure yet
what you're worth,

sell‐through data.
