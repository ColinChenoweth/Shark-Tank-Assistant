Tonight on "Shark Tank"...

I'm here to talk about something
we have all experienced.

We're just some small‐town boys

going in on this deal

I would consider that.
I'll do it at 20%.

Now it gets interesting.
I'll make you the same offer.

Ooh, now it's getting
more interesting.

00:00:23,663 --> 00:00:25,632
I'm really good
at negotiating.

00:00:25,632 --> 00:00:27,601
Can you negotiate yourself

from the great city of Philly,

00:00:55,195 --> 00:00:59,332

00:00:59,332 --> 00:01:02,035
Sharks, if you couldn't tell,
I'm a chef.

00:01:02,035 --> 00:01:04,471
I've prepared some
of the most exquisite meals

you can even imagine,

00:01:05,872 --> 00:01:08,275
but my favorite to prepare is ‐‐
you're never gonna guess ‐‐

But not just any salad, Sharks.

00:01:10,944 --> 00:01:13,713

that's shake and bake

So, before COVID, the primary
revenue driver for our business

00:02:56,983 --> 00:02:58,985
by this fleet
of these smart coolers

00:02:58,985 --> 00:03:00,587
that we would put into places

00:03:00,587 --> 00:03:02,055
where there was kind of
a captive audience,

00:03:02,055 --> 00:03:04,491
not a lot of access to food,
let alone fresh food.

So, literally
almost overnight.

00:03:22,242 --> 00:03:24,377
So we had to figure out,

00:03:24,377 --> 00:03:27,080
how were we going to follow that
customer to where they were now,

And we were able to very quickly
make the pivot to retail.

Oh, yeah,
and they might not come back.

if they do come back,

00:04:20,867 --> 00:04:23,937
Yeah, so our contract
with CloudKitchens is national.

00:04:23,937 --> 00:04:25,772
And what do you
sell one for?

00:04:25,772 --> 00:04:28,708
So, jars sell from $8.99
to $10.99 today.

00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,477
And what do you sell it
to the retailer for?

00:04:30,477 --> 00:04:32,979
So, on the wholesale model,
we're selling it $5 to $6.

00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:35,081
It costs us
about $2.50 to $3.60.

00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:37,250
So you're making
about $3.50 each.

00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,652
Alright, why don't we
talk about your numbers?

00:04:38,652 --> 00:04:41,054

And then what are you on track
to do this year?

00:04:46,226 --> 00:04:48,695
So last year, we did
just shy of about $300,000.

$300,000?
$300,000 last year.

Wait a minute.
Hold on. Wait.

00:04:51,765 --> 00:04:54,200
I want to make sure that I heard
the valuation correctly.

00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,770
You want $500,000 for 7%?
That's it?

00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,138
Oh, yeah.
Alright, talk to me, baby.

00:04:58,138 --> 00:04:59,339
What are you on track
to do this year?

00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:02,108
So, we're $475,000
year to date.
Ooh.

00:05:02,108 --> 00:05:04,811
We're on track to do about
$700,000, $750,000 this year.

00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:07,647
$750,000, and how much
will you make on that?

00:05:07,647 --> 00:05:09,149
We're not profitable.

00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:10,650
We won't be for about a year.
Oh!

00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,185
And how much
have you raised?

00:05:12,185 --> 00:05:14,254
We raised $2.5 million
to date.

00:05:14,254 --> 00:05:15,588
‐Whoa!
‐Wow.

00:05:15,588 --> 00:05:17,023
‐I know.
‐Wow.

00:05:17,023 --> 00:05:20,026
A lot of that was predicated
on buying 60 of these things

00:05:20,026 --> 00:05:22,662
and really funding
that model.

00:05:22,662 --> 00:05:25,432
You did say that you're not
gonna make any money this year.

00:05:25,432 --> 00:05:26,666
Correct.
What did you lose last year?

00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:27,867
Probably not next year, either.
What did you lose?

00:05:27,867 --> 00:05:28,968
$900,000.

00:05:28,968 --> 00:05:30,337
Last year,

‐Yep.
‐Wow.

00:05:31,571 --> 00:05:33,707
We're gonna probably
lose that this year again.

‐Ouch! Ouch!
‐Oh!

00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,576
But we more than doubled
our revenue.

00:05:36,576 --> 00:05:37,844
But hear me out.

00:05:37,844 --> 00:05:40,880
So this is a food company
that we're looking to take

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,616
to a national distribution
in 18 months.

00:05:43,616 --> 00:05:45,685
We have the relationships,
the production,

00:05:45,685 --> 00:05:47,220
and the distribution.

00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,521
We're building this
to $50 million

00:05:48,521 --> 00:05:50,957
to $100 million company
in the next two years.

00:05:50,957 --> 00:05:52,826
How much of your own money
did you invest in this?

00:05:52,826 --> 00:05:55,528
So I started this entire company
on a $1,000 loan.

00:05:55,528 --> 00:05:57,163
‐Okay.
‐Really?
‐Cool.
‐Oh, yeah.

00:05:57,163 --> 00:05:59,799
I had been working on this
for probably five years.

00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:02,102
And how much of the company
do you own?

00:06:02,102 --> 00:06:03,436
51%.

00:06:03,436 --> 00:06:04,871
‐Ooh. Okay.
‐Ooh!

00:06:04,871 --> 00:06:05,905
Who owns the other 49%?

00:06:05,905 --> 00:06:08,108
We have probably about
a cap table

00:06:08,108 --> 00:06:11,077
of maybe 12 other individuals
and groups.

00:06:11,077 --> 00:06:15,148
But I've assembled a team to
take this to scale in a big way

00:06:15,148 --> 00:06:16,282
and do it smartly.

00:06:16,282 --> 00:06:17,650
So we're paying for that.

00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,085
Jared, I think ‐‐

00:06:19,085 --> 00:06:21,221
I think
you're in trouble.

All Sharks are still in,

00:06:32,465 --> 00:06:34,901
but Daymond is concerned about

that Jared has raised
for his salad‐in‐a‐jar company,

I don't believe
I'm in trouble at all.

You know, you're gonna need
several more raises.

00:06:45,845 --> 00:06:47,647
You're not gonna be in control
of the company anymore

00:06:47,647 --> 00:06:49,716
'cause you're at 51%.
You lose control
right here today.

00:06:49,716 --> 00:06:51,718
I'm not worried about that.

00:06:51,718 --> 00:06:54,087
I'm worried for you, man.
Why?

00:06:54,087 --> 00:06:55,789
Look, if I'm gonna
raise a series A,

00:06:55,789 --> 00:06:56,990
I'm gonna lose control.

00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,825
No entrepreneur
that's gonna take something

00:06:58,825 --> 00:07:01,628
to the level
that we are shooting for

00:07:01,628 --> 00:07:03,997
is gonna have 80%
of the company in his pocket.

00:07:03,997 --> 00:07:06,132
Do you remember Plated?
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Know them well.

00:07:06,132 --> 00:07:07,567
Okay, that was my deal.
Yep.

00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:10,870
Your numbers are identical
in the second year.
Sure.

00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,107
We were losing between $900,000
and $1.5 million

00:07:14,107 --> 00:07:15,942
for three years in a row.
Right.

00:07:15,942 --> 00:07:18,077
It is expensive, baby.
Sure.

00:07:18,077 --> 00:07:20,346
So that was
a big, big, big burn,

00:07:20,346 --> 00:07:22,849
and it was scaring the living
you know what out of me...
Yep.

00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:25,952
...until we sold it
to Albertsons for $340 million.

00:07:25,952 --> 00:07:28,087
Sure.
So I'm a believer
in this space.

00:07:28,087 --> 00:07:29,522
And I like the product.

00:07:29,522 --> 00:07:32,058
So I'm thinking
you're gonna need to raise

00:07:32,058 --> 00:07:34,394
somewhere between another
5 and 10 million bucks.

00:07:34,394 --> 00:07:35,728
That's exactly what
we're doing right now, yep.

00:07:35,728 --> 00:07:38,331
Okay, and so that's
extremely dilutive.

00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:40,733
I'm gonna make you the same
offer I made the Plated guys.

00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:44,037
They choked on it, but we all
made a lot of money later.

00:07:44,037 --> 00:07:48,341
I will do the $500,000 as debt
at 9.5%,

00:07:48,341 --> 00:07:50,677
and I'll take the 7%
as equity...
It's the same.

00:07:50,677 --> 00:07:53,379
...so that you're not going to
dilute yourself any more,

00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:56,716
and that 7%'s
gonna get diluted down

00:07:56,716 --> 00:07:59,052
to about 4%
by the time you finish.
Yep.

00:07:59,052 --> 00:08:00,620
And I'll help you
with the A round.
A lot more than that.

00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,422
I know how to do
that syndication.

00:08:02,422 --> 00:08:05,158
I love the deal, so I'm
definitely considering it.

00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:06,392
It's not off the table.

00:08:06,392 --> 00:08:10,096
Jared, I love it, except
I just realized something.

00:08:12,432 --> 00:08:14,567
I don't think
it's gonna work.

00:08:14,567 --> 00:08:18,004
I actually think you're gonna
start losing far more money

00:08:18,004 --> 00:08:19,138
as you get bigger.
Yeah.

00:08:19,138 --> 00:08:21,174
And the only light
at the end of that tunnel

00:08:21,174 --> 00:08:23,276
is somebody
buying you out.

You've got to be
everywhere tomorrow.

00:08:26,846 --> 00:08:29,415

for me in this.

00:08:29,415 --> 00:08:30,750

I'm out.

You started with $1,000.

00:08:42,061 --> 00:08:44,864
That's as underdog
as you can get.
Yeah, I'm not mad at it, right?

00:08:44,864 --> 00:08:47,567
I think you're gonna have to
raise a lot of money

00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:49,369
or you're gonna die,
and I see a lot of these deals,

00:08:49,369 --> 00:08:50,937
but I just don't know
if you're gonna be able

00:08:50,937 --> 00:08:53,806
to make it through
that critical time.

00:08:53,806 --> 00:08:55,208
Sure. Well, this is
the critical time, right?

00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,710
And for us, 500 doors
represents $5 million.

00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,946
I know it is, but I don't want
it to be a critical time

00:08:59,946 --> 00:09:01,381
for my money,
so I'm out.

00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:06,586
Listen, you were in a situation
in COVID.

It wasn't working.
Everything closed down.

00:09:08,721 --> 00:09:11,057
You created something new.

00:09:11,057 --> 00:09:14,894
I would actually consider going
in on this deal with Kevin.

00:09:14,894 --> 00:09:15,962
Kevin?

00:09:15,962 --> 00:09:17,530
I would consider that.

I like
to do things myself.

But the reason
why I would consider

00:09:23,469 --> 00:09:27,307
is because I think with my sales
and marketing skills,

00:09:27,307 --> 00:09:30,310
packaging skills,
and I like Kevin,

00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,912
and his experience with Plated,
I find very appealing.

00:09:32,912 --> 00:09:34,347
I think it's a good combo

00:09:34,347 --> 00:09:35,949
because we get
the marketing from Lori.

00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:37,617
But I want to work with you
on the A round.

00:09:37,617 --> 00:09:38,885
Yeah.
Look, I'll make it official.

Yeah, Mark's always quiet.

So, I'll match their offer,
but at 3% interest.

But I'm gonna suggest that
we don't push for the series A.

different people sitting here.

and blitz out so fast...
Exactly.

a styling comb
for the Black community

00:12:12,305 --> 00:12:14,640
that allowed us
to embrace our natural twists.

Twist It Up Comb is now sold
on my website, on Amazon,

Hello, Sharks.

00:14:32,011 --> 00:14:34,413
I'm Nancy Rothner
from Lewes, Delaware,

00:14:34,413 --> 00:14:35,882
and I'm here
to talk about something

00:14:35,882 --> 00:14:38,684
we have all experienced ‐‐
stress.

simply take some out, knead it,

00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,188
and allow the calming to begin.

I love the yellow.
Yeah.

The scent component's there
because when we're stressed,

what happens is everything

Since our brain is so heavily
hardwired to our fingers,

00:16:14,347 --> 00:16:17,083
this helps us to become
a little bit more centered.

00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,652
Then the tension that we have
in our body

You were a stockbroker?
I was, yeah.

00:16:55,087 --> 00:16:59,025
But then I volunteered at
a shelter for domestic violence,

00:21:28,494 --> 00:21:30,229
You're not gonna change
from 25%?

00:21:30,229 --> 00:21:32,731
Okay, Robert,
every single year,

00:21:32,731 --> 00:21:34,533
we've been profitable,
profitable.

00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:38,203
And this is just with retail
that's coming back.
Nancy, you're great.

00:21:38,203 --> 00:21:41,507
Thank you.
I think if you had
more of an e‐commerce strategy,

00:21:41,507 --> 00:21:43,742
I would have a little more
wiggle room...
That's why I'm here.

00:21:43,742 --> 00:21:45,311
...'cause I think
it's gonna be a lot of work.

00:21:45,311 --> 00:21:47,646
No disrespect
to what you've built.
Understood.

00:21:47,646 --> 00:21:49,214
I'll do it at 20%.

00:21:49,214 --> 00:21:50,616
You'll do it for 20%?

00:21:50,616 --> 00:21:53,452
There you go.
Now it gets interesting.

00:21:53,452 --> 00:21:54,887
Alright,
I'll do it at 20%.

00:21:54,887 --> 00:21:56,588
Ooh! Now it's getting
more interesting.

00:22:02,461 --> 00:22:04,697
how about...

00:22:04,697 --> 00:22:05,931
17%?

00:22:05,931 --> 00:22:07,433
I'm not going into
a bidding war with Daymond.

00:22:07,433 --> 00:22:08,934
I already came down by the 5%,
which I wasn't going to.

00:22:08,934 --> 00:22:11,470
Can you come just a smidgen
down more?

00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,839
Um...

00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:16,175
I feel really good
at 20%.

00:22:16,175 --> 00:22:18,777
Do you hear how calm
my voice is?

00:22:18,777 --> 00:22:21,447
Can we move you down
just a smidgen from 20%?

00:22:21,447 --> 00:22:24,049
Just a smidgen,
and we'll be good.

00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:25,551
Just a smidgen.

00:22:25,551 --> 00:22:27,753
Oh, my God,
you're such a good negotiator.

00:22:27,753 --> 00:22:30,055
But I mean it.
You're so calm.

00:22:30,055 --> 00:22:31,390
And I'm like, "Ohh."

00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:33,158
I was like, "I'm not
going down below 25%."

00:22:33,158 --> 00:22:36,161
Now I'm at 20%, and I'm like,
"Should I go down?"

00:22:36,161 --> 00:22:37,629
You are good, lady.

00:22:37,629 --> 00:22:38,664
Thank you.

00:22:38,664 --> 00:22:39,998
I think we gave you
a valuation

00:22:39,998 --> 00:22:41,533
that we all feel
comfortable with generally,

00:22:41,533 --> 00:22:43,802
and I came in at 20% because...
I appreciate that.

00:22:43,802 --> 00:22:45,104
...I just appreciated you

00:22:45,104 --> 00:22:46,605
and I already
brought it down for you.

00:22:46,605 --> 00:22:48,006
Thank you,
and I do appreciate it.

00:22:48,006 --> 00:22:50,609
Just a smidgen?
So I would just love
to stay at 20%.

Can we ‐‐
Just a little more?

00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:55,147
I'm gonna stay at 20%.

I already came down the 5%
because I believe in ‐‐

00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,919
I just think it's such
a great opportunity.
You got to make a decision,
Nancy.

00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:02,588
Okay.
One of those moments.

00:23:02,588 --> 00:23:04,523
Okay.

00:23:04,523 --> 00:23:06,825
Alright,
you're all amazing.

I want this more than anything.

I really do. So...

00:23:11,397 --> 00:23:14,933
Robert, I will gladly
accept your deal.

00:23:14,933 --> 00:23:16,935
Thank you.
And thank you, Daymond.
Cuban: Well done.

00:23:16,935 --> 00:23:19,605
I'm so calm that I'm not
gonna throw this at you.

Bye.

00:23:23,575 --> 00:23:25,477
That's a rock‐star partner,
Robert.

00:23:28,247 --> 00:23:31,316
Before I walked in, Robert's
the one I wanted to work with,

00:23:31,316 --> 00:23:33,719
and even though
he wouldn't budge from 20%

00:23:33,719 --> 00:23:35,888
and it was 5% more
than what I wanted,

00:23:35,888 --> 00:23:37,389
I felt that he was so worth it.

00:23:37,389 --> 00:23:39,525
So I'm thrilled
to be working with him.

The main feature is
the insulated six‐pack cooler

located right here

00:24:43,055 --> 00:24:44,890
Yeah! That's the way

So who came up with this?

00:25:55,794 --> 00:25:59,264
Earl.
So I came up with it
a couple years back.

00:25:59,264 --> 00:26:02,200
We were at a football game.
I went to the bar.

00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,936
And I just kept thinking
after I got off work,

00:26:03,936 --> 00:26:06,538
"I wish I would have
just had my overalls on still

00:26:06,538 --> 00:26:07,973
and brought a couple
beers with me."

00:26:07,973 --> 00:26:09,908
And then I woke up
the next morning, had a drawing,

00:26:09,908 --> 00:26:12,077
and just started
making them, basically.

00:26:12,077 --> 00:26:13,679

Yes, yes.

00:26:17,249 --> 00:26:19,318

What I do right now ‐‐ I just
graduated Iowa State University.

My plan was to go full time

in September.

00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,901
‐Congrats.

opener and the Muff Mug.

manufacturing out of?

'cause our manufacturer
in China shut down.

00:27:14,873 --> 00:27:16,675
Let me just take
a wild guess.

00:27:16,675 --> 00:27:20,512
I would assume you're probably
about $75,000 invested into it.

00:27:20,512 --> 00:27:21,813
Invested into it.
Yeah.

00:27:21,813 --> 00:27:23,015
Actually right on the dot.
That's right on the dot.

00:27:23,015 --> 00:27:24,249
$70,000, $5,000.

00:27:25,651 --> 00:27:27,052
Wow, good one.

00:27:27,052 --> 00:27:29,621
But that's what we've invested.
We're not in debt that.

00:27:29,621 --> 00:27:30,989
It's not bad.
How many units?

00:27:30,989 --> 00:27:32,658
To get your own
product...

00:27:32,658 --> 00:27:34,459
And make it to "Shark Tank."
...and learn ‐‐
and learn on the fly?

00:27:34,459 --> 00:27:36,128
And you're drinking beer

Let's drink to that, guys.

00:27:37,663 --> 00:27:39,798
That's also not
our only product.

00:27:39,798 --> 00:27:41,199
Cheers.
Yeah. One second.

00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:42,801
Will you hold that?
Yeah. Here, hold on, guys.

00:27:42,801 --> 00:27:44,703
We got another product that's
gonna help us get going here.
Oh, no.

00:27:44,703 --> 00:27:46,038
‐But yet there's more.
‐But wait, there's more?

00:27:46,038 --> 00:27:48,507
There's more.
Got some suspenders for you.

00:27:48,507 --> 00:27:50,242
I love that.

00:27:50,242 --> 00:27:51,576
That is the winner
right there.

00:27:51,576 --> 00:27:53,512
So we thought,
you know, $85 ‐‐

00:27:53,512 --> 00:27:55,380
People are saying,
"We love you guys.

00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,916
We love your brand, but we don't
want to spend $85."

00:27:57,916 --> 00:28:01,119
So Earl said, "Hey,
let's put these same pockets,

00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:03,155
let's put two of them
on the suspenders,"

00:28:03,155 --> 00:28:05,724
and then keep the branding
with the bottle opener

00:28:05,724 --> 00:28:07,526
and the koozie
right there.

00:28:07,526 --> 00:28:08,794
How much
are the suspenders?

00:28:08,794 --> 00:28:10,662
So you guys are looking
at the first prototype.

00:28:10,662 --> 00:28:12,030
Only pair in the U. S.
right there.

00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,099
There you go.
Collector's item.

00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:16,568
Do you have a patent on it?
Glad you brought that up.

00:28:16,568 --> 00:28:20,205
So right now we have two patents
on the Muff Waders themselves.

00:28:20,205 --> 00:28:22,941
One is issued,
one is notice of allowance,

00:28:22,941 --> 00:28:24,443
which I believe means we just

Wow. I never would have thought
you'd get a patent for that.

00:35:44,649 --> 00:35:47,318
Love the story.
Love the video.

00:35:47,318 --> 00:35:49,521
Now you're in the Tank.

00:35:49,521 --> 00:35:52,290
Let's talk money.
Okay, what are your sales?

00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:54,325
Well, I started
selling last year.

00:35:54,325 --> 00:35:57,162
2019, I ended the year
at $97,000.

00:35:57,162 --> 00:35:59,164
Okay.
I know that's not a ton.

00:35:59,164 --> 00:36:00,365
I know that.
Proof of concept, though.

00:36:00,365 --> 00:36:01,366
People are buying it.

00:36:01,366 --> 00:36:03,301
‐So 2020, right?
‐Mm‐hmm.

00:36:03,301 --> 00:36:04,569
Tell us about
what happened.

00:36:04,569 --> 00:36:06,538
So in 2019, I traveled
around the country

00:36:06,538 --> 00:36:09,908
from expo to expo to expo
to expo on the weekends

00:36:09,908 --> 00:36:11,943
to get in front of people
and do the demos.

00:36:11,943 --> 00:36:14,012
And so for 2020,
that was my plan.

00:36:14,012 --> 00:36:16,347
And then a pandemic happened.
Yeah.

00:36:16,347 --> 00:36:20,585
And so January and February
was maybe $20,000 in sales.

00:36:20,585 --> 00:36:24,756
Since then, I have now
had $323,000 in sales.

00:36:24,756 --> 00:36:26,824
‐Whoa.
‐Wow! How did that happen?

00:36:26,824 --> 00:36:28,860
‐How did that happen?
‐That's fast.

00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:32,597
Well, in March,
when all my sales dropped

00:36:32,597 --> 00:36:34,632
and I had no expos
to go to anymore,

00:36:34,632 --> 00:36:36,501
which was my big plan,
I said, "You know what?

00:36:36,501 --> 00:36:38,369
I'm gonna divert
all of my travel budget

00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:40,972
for my expos
to social‐media ads."

00:36:40,972 --> 00:36:43,675
And I went from zero orders
to 20 orders a day...

00:36:43,675 --> 00:36:45,009
Greiner: Wow.
...within two days.

00:36:45,009 --> 00:36:46,611
O'Leary: You've done
the great digital pivot,

00:36:46,611 --> 00:36:49,047
which so many entrepreneurs
haven't been able to figure out.

00:36:49,047 --> 00:36:51,816
But the ones that have
end up like you.

00:36:51,816 --> 00:36:54,352
What do you think you'll get
by year end,

00:36:54,352 --> 00:36:56,087
given you're past $300,000
already?

00:36:56,087 --> 00:36:58,189
I'm looking at
just under $900,000.

00:36:58,189 --> 00:36:59,557
‐Whoo! Wow.
‐How much?

00:36:59,557 --> 00:37:00,825
Just under $900,000.

00:37:00,825 --> 00:37:02,660
Cuban: On that same topic,
how much will you make

00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,329
from your $900,000
in sales?

00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:06,231
The net profit is 20%.

00:37:06,231 --> 00:37:08,032
Okay, so about $180,000.
Mm‐hmm.

00:37:08,032 --> 00:37:11,603
Normally at this point,
with about $400,000 in sales

00:37:11,603 --> 00:37:14,205
and projected $900,000,
we would be ripping you apart

00:37:14,205 --> 00:37:16,574
for a $5 million
valuation.

00:37:16,574 --> 00:37:18,943
Why do you think the company
is worth $5 million?

00:37:18,943 --> 00:37:21,279
Okay, so if I keep doing exactly
what I'm doing right now,

00:37:21,279 --> 00:37:24,482
I'm also adding toys to my
website so that it's an add‐on.

00:37:24,482 --> 00:37:26,084
What kind of toys?
Teething toys.

00:37:26,084 --> 00:37:28,553
I have two, so all the toys
you see, basically,

00:37:28,553 --> 00:37:30,154
in front of you,
they all are ‐‐

00:37:30,154 --> 00:37:32,290
Okay, so they're
upsell accessories.
They're upsells.

00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:33,625
Okay.
I have a lot of people

00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:35,860
coming back to buy these now
as baby shower gifts,

00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:39,264
so next year, I can easily do
$5 million just with that

00:37:39,264 --> 00:37:40,698
without changing anything else.
O'Leary: Very aggressive.

00:37:40,698 --> 00:37:43,501
Mark and I invested
in a product called Lollacup

00:37:43,501 --> 00:37:45,203
years ago,
I think Season ‐‐

00:37:45,203 --> 00:37:46,537
Works great with the mat.
Cuban: Yeah, which we just sold.

00:37:46,537 --> 00:37:48,039
Which we just sold.
Yeah, we just sold it.

00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:49,807
Works great with the mat.
Yeah, and it worked out great.

00:37:49,807 --> 00:37:53,177
Go right around the handle.
The problem with a lot
of these baby products

00:37:53,177 --> 00:37:55,913
is it's a relatively
limited market.

00:37:55,913 --> 00:37:58,016
You've got
this limited window.

00:37:58,016 --> 00:38:00,351
It's a single product.
It's a great product.
But you know what?

00:38:00,351 --> 00:38:02,453
Babies are born every year.

00:38:02,453 --> 00:38:04,722
Millions of them every year
all over the world.
Cuban: Yeah, they are.
Yeah, they are.

00:38:04,722 --> 00:38:07,458
So the market regenerates itself
every single year.

00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:09,060
What you're doing
is incredible, right?

00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,162
And I love the idea that
you've created a platform.

00:38:11,162 --> 00:38:13,131
The upsells
are brilliant.

00:38:13,131 --> 00:38:15,566
But the reality is,
the baby market

00:38:15,566 --> 00:38:17,735
is a very unique
and specific market

00:38:17,735 --> 00:38:19,404
that requires
a certain skill set.

00:38:19,404 --> 00:38:21,172
And since
we sold Lollacup,

00:38:21,172 --> 00:38:24,309
that was my last foray
into the baby market.

00:38:24,309 --> 00:38:26,577
So while what you've
accomplished is amazing,

00:38:26,577 --> 00:38:28,646
it's not really a fit for me,
so for those reasons, I'm out.

00:38:28,646 --> 00:38:30,682
I totally understand.
Thank you, Mark.
You're welcome.

00:38:30,682 --> 00:38:32,717
You know,
I'm always in awe of women

00:38:32,717 --> 00:38:34,118
that serve
in the military.

00:38:34,118 --> 00:38:36,554
You know, I look at you
and I'm already impressed by you

00:38:36,554 --> 00:38:40,491
because you did that
and you did it for 10 years.

00:38:40,491 --> 00:38:42,860

an offer.

Greiner:
I'm gonna give you an offer.

00:39:01,446 --> 00:39:03,081
It'll be
a little aggressive

00:39:03,081 --> 00:39:05,683
because we just did a licensing
deal with my Baby Toon.

00:39:05,683 --> 00:39:07,819
With Munchkin.
Yes, with Munchkin.

00:39:07,819 --> 00:39:10,021
You know, I have
a great partnership with them,

00:39:10,021 --> 00:39:13,791
and I think that this would be
a really great product for them.

00:39:13,791 --> 00:39:18,296
So I'm gonna offer you
the $250,000,

00:39:18,296 --> 00:39:20,198
but I'd like 20%.

00:39:20,198 --> 00:39:22,333

of equity ask.
And the goal ‐‐

00:39:23,534 --> 00:39:26,137
the goal would be
to go to Munchkin

00:39:26,137 --> 00:39:29,974
and see if they would do
a licensing deal with us.

00:39:29,974 --> 00:39:31,676
But they would be
doing the retail.
Yeah.

00:39:31,676 --> 00:39:33,578
They would be doing
the manufacturing.

00:39:33,578 --> 00:39:35,012

a nice thing.
