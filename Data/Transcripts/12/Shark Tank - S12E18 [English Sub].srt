special about what you're doing,

00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:36,562
'cause your numbers
clearly say it.

00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:38,864
So, for example,
a future NBA Hall‐of‐Famer

00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:40,799
from the Miami Heat
actually reached out to us

00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,301
asking about the product,

00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:44,002
and he's been using it
for the past month now.

00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:45,904
So it's organic, right?
It's been organic.
Zak: It's organic.

00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:47,206
And you're not paying people
to do these things?

00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:48,407
We are paying
some influencers.

00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:49,942
Okay, so, tell us about
what you're doing there.

00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:51,310
It depends on
the influencer, right?

00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,612
So, we could have a top‐10
tattoo artist in the world

00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,681
that we say, "Okay,
we need to pay $5,000

00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:56,849
so he posts us."

00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:59,818
We also have influencers
like these two models

00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:01,520
who each have
their own following.

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,388
But the cool thing
about tattoos is,

00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,357
everyone has tattoos
for different reasons.

00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:07,126
So each of these influencers
kind of has

00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,428
their own submarkets,
if that makes sense.
Right, right.

00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:11,697

customer acquisition cost.

00:27:11,697 --> 00:27:13,699

between $6 or $7.

what you're doing
for content creation,

00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,771
because what we're all
trying to figure out is,

00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:21,206
what's the secret sauce?

00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:23,942
I think our secret sauce is this
community of tight‐knit people

00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:25,144
that we've been able to build.

00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,613

00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:51,703
There is
an electric assist.

00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:52,938
The electric assist,
it's easy.

00:32:52,938 --> 00:32:54,139
Like, a lot
of our customers

00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:56,308
are not necessarily
the most experienced bikers.

00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:58,643
and so with
the electric,

00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,479
I mean,
anybody can do it.

00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:02,347
It has parking brakes.
That's a good thing.

00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:04,683
Can you take it apart easily
to transport it?

00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:06,051
No.

00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:08,320
So, the advantage of this bike
is it's got a big box.

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,956
You can put a lot of stuff
in it, up to four kids,

00:33:10,956 --> 00:33:13,225
picnic, grocery, cooler,
all of that.

00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:15,327
But the disadvantage is
it does not come apart

00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:16,795
easily for transport.

00:33:16,795 --> 00:33:19,498
So your box to ship it's
gonna be pretty big, right?

00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,233
It is big, and so we actually

00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:23,869
only ship these bikes
fully assembled.

00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:26,204
We use a motorcycle
shipping company.

00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:28,006
That should be
very expensive, though.

00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,375
It is expensive ‐‐
$450 to ship.

00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,576
‐Ooh.
‐Wow.

00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:34,579
Yes, but it is less expensive
than shipping

00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:37,682
the big, cardboard boxes
to the customer

00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,251
and then having them...
‐Assemble it.

00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:40,352
...pay a bike shop
to assemble it.

00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,820
They're gonna bill
that customer $300.

00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,155
Aaron, what does
the bike itself cost?

00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:46,458
So, we have two
different bikes here.

00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,627
This is the one that
we've been selling the longest.

00:33:48,627 --> 00:33:50,929
We retail it at $4,295.

00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:51,963
Oof.
Wow!

00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:53,632
‐$4,295?
‐$4,295?

00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:54,866
$4,295. That's right.

00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,702
So I can buy the bike
or send my kids to college.

00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,037
[ Laughter ]

00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,939
$4,295 sounds like a lot.

00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:03,441
This one's actually $6,000.
Of course it is.

00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:06,311
And we're going for the premium
quality on the market.

00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:07,646
So it's basically got

00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:09,114
the top‐of‐the‐line
everything component‐wise.

00:34:09,114 --> 00:34:10,215
‐Wow.
‐Oh.

00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,150
Aaron, why did you invent
the bike?

00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,818
I did not invent this bike.
Oh.

00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:15,253
So let me give you a backstory

00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:17,322
about how I kind of
came to this idea.
Please do. Okay.

00:34:17,322 --> 00:34:21,059
So I actually used to be, like,
a middle‐school band teacher

00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,394
back in the day, and...

00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:24,296
You know, you look like
a middle‐school band teacher.

00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:26,264
I guess I'll take that
as a compliment.

00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:27,832
That's flattering.
That's flattering.

00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:31,336
And then everything changed
the day my daughter was born.

00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:34,239
And it was like this switch
just, like, flipped in my brain,

00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,841
like, I don't want
to be a teacher anymore.

00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:38,410
And so I call my principal.

00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:41,613
I took a 90‐day maternity leave,
and I said,

00:34:41,613 --> 00:34:43,081
"Okay, I need to take
this 90 days.

00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,517
I need to find a business that
I can start that will give me

00:34:45,517 --> 00:34:49,721
eventually the freedom to,
you know, put my family first."

00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:52,390
And so I actually found
an opportunity

00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,125
in the online jewelry space.

00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:58,730
And over the next 18 months,
I put 5 to 6 hours a night,

00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,365
all my money back into it.

00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:03,702
And then I was double my
teaching salary, and so I quit.

00:35:03,702 --> 00:35:06,705
To celebrate,
we took a family trip to Sweden.

00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:08,940
And that's actually
where I saw a bike like this

00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,076
for the first time.

00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:12,877
And, you know,
initially, I just thought,

00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:14,546
"Hey, that's cool.
I want to get one."

00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:16,648
I'm into bikes.
I want to ride with my kids.

00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:18,617
We come back to the U. S.

00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:21,486
There's not really anywhere
to get one from.

00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:23,922
And so I thought,
"Hey, here's an opportunity.

00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:25,323
Like, this is, like, something

00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:27,359
that a lot of people
would be interested in."

00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:31,363
And so I sold the last business
for $300,000.

00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:33,465
I paid off all my student loans.

00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,300
I put $85,000 into the Bunch.

00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,368
And that's kind of
how we got started.

00:35:36,368 --> 00:35:37,402
You sold
an online jewelry business

00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:38,837
for $300,000?
That's right.

00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:40,939
And it was about two and
a half years after I started it.

00:35:40,939 --> 00:35:43,141
Did you buy into this business?
Oh, yeah, yeah, gotcha.

00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,776
Are you a licensee?

00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:47,612
So I just wanted to prove
there was even a market here.

00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:48,947
So I started small.

00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:51,316
I got one sample from a factory

00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:52,584
that was already
making bikes like this

00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:53,785
for the European market.

00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:55,620
And there was a lot of interest,
a lot of sales

00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,089
right out the gate
just from my Instagram posts.

00:35:58,089 --> 00:35:59,457
That's a $6,000 bike, right?

00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:00,925
Yes.
What do you buy it for?

00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:03,995
So, landed, I can get this bike
for $2,917.

00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,564
So as an investor, what am
I really investing in?

00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:10,001
I'm investing in a good guy ‐‐
Aaron, the bike guy,

I don't own
any proprietary technology.

00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,606
Well, it's...
Really good point.

00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:16,441
It's their proprietary design.

00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:17,842
They've got it registered.

‐Wow.
‐You're killing it.

Cuban:
You've done a great job.

Don't get me wrong,
right?

00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:47,739
You know, $2.2 million
in sales is killing it.

00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:49,974
Right? But it's hard for us
to just say, "You know what?

Well, can I give you
the long‐term plan?

00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,452
My goal, my vision, is,
actually, I want to

00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:02,954
make these bikes accessible
to more people,

00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:05,490
and so to have my own design
at that point,

00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,592
where we can roll out
5,000 bikes a year

00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,694
and reach more people, maybe
under a different brand

00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:11,529
or something like that.
That's very laudable, right?
It's great.

00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:13,231
But that's a lot
of uncertainty.

00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,533

But you're a distributor.
There's nothing wrong with that.

If I gave you $250,000

00:38:14,192 --> 00:38:16,895
it would be four years
until I got my capital back

00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:35,473
I felt like I came in
with a pretty reasonable offer.

00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:36,908
I mean, that's cutting
my valuation so much.

00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:38,309
There's nothing reasonable
about Barbara.

00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:39,844
I'm bringing
a lot to the table here, too.

00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:43,948
Getting this started
was not easy.

00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:47,752
In our first year, I had
my first manufacturers screw me.

00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:50,955
They had had a typhoon come in,
flood out their factory.

00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:54,058
My bikes had been underwater,
like, a foot underwater,

00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,194
and they shipped them
out to us anyways.

00:39:56,194 --> 00:39:57,762
And then I had
to pay tariffs on them.

00:39:57,762 --> 00:39:59,597
We get the bikes, open up
that container.

00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:01,799
It's like, a flood of humidity
just hits you.

00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:03,735
And we knew something
was wrong.
Oh, that's got to be horrible.

00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:06,537
We open up the bikes. Water's
pouring out of the motors.

00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:08,039
And it's like, it's toast.
Oh, no.

00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:10,642
Like, whole container lost.

00:40:10,642 --> 00:40:13,344
Get that money back?
Somebody else could have, like,
shipped those bikes out

00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:14,646
to customers, but, like, no.

00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:16,581
Like, we're gonna do right
by our customers.

00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,049
I'm gonna take the hit.

00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:19,884
That's the first time I had
to take a loan for the business.

00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:21,419
You just said you took a loan
for the business.

00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,820
Does the business
have any debt right now?

00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,989
Yeah. So right now,
we have $50,000 in loan

00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:26,457
that will be paid off
by the end of this year.

00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:28,226
I've got $50,000
on credit cards.

00:40:28,226 --> 00:40:30,495
And earlier this year,
in April,

00:40:30,495 --> 00:40:33,231
I took out a $150,000 SBA loan
that I just put into inventory.

00:40:33,231 --> 00:40:36,200
And did you raise any money
from any other investors?

00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,403
Earlier this year,
I raised $95,000 ‐‐

00:40:38,403 --> 00:40:40,271
$45,000
from family and friends

00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,774
and $50,000
from two angel investors.

00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:45,143
Oh, I had no idea
you had borrowed so much money.

00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:47,979
It was just because
I was willing to take that risk,

00:40:47,979 --> 00:40:49,781
take that on,
but we're profitable.

00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:51,716
We're making money.
I'm paying it all down.
