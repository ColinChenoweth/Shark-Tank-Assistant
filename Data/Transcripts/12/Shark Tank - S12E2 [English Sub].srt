and you could transform
into anybody you wanted to be,

00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,675
and that's when it hit me ‐‐

00:13:57,675 --> 00:14:01,312
This is the business
that I wanted to be in.

00:14:01,312 --> 00:14:03,581
At age 19, I started
my first company.

00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:06,283
It was The Hat Box.
I sold every kind of hat.

00:14:06,283 --> 00:14:07,618
I realized very quickly

00:14:07,618 --> 00:14:09,854
that this business
wasn't going to be sustainable.

00:14:09,854 --> 00:14:13,724
People wearing hats again
like it was 1940 didn't happen.

00:14:13,724 --> 00:14:16,560
I had to close
that first business. It failed.

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,096
It was one of the lowest
moments of my life,

00:14:19,096 --> 00:14:21,198
and in retrospect,
I look back to it now,

00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:24,335
and it was also the greatest
gift I was ever given.

00:14:24,335 --> 00:14:27,471
What was so funny is I made
jewelry for my hat store,

00:14:27,471 --> 00:14:29,940
and it would sell the day
that I'd put it in the case.

00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,377
But I was so headstrong
that the hat thing had to work

00:14:33,377 --> 00:14:36,413
that I wasn't paying attention
to what <i>was</i> working.

00:14:36,413 --> 00:14:39,617
So, in 2001, I started
to create some jewelry.

00:14:39,617 --> 00:14:41,685
I went store to store
in Austin, Texas.

00:14:41,685 --> 00:14:45,623
I sold my sample set,
and I got a check for $1,500.

00:14:45,623 --> 00:14:46,824
And I walked in the front door,

00:14:46,824 --> 00:14:48,359
and I remember saying
to my husband,

00:14:48,359 --> 00:14:51,595
"Baby, we got ourselves
a business."

00:14:51,595 --> 00:14:54,532
I loved beautiful
semiprecious stones,

00:14:54,532 --> 00:14:57,701
but I couldn't afford what was
out there in the marketplace.

00:14:57,701 --> 00:14:59,003
And I thought,
if there was a way

00:14:59,003 --> 00:15:01,672
that I could make beautiful
hand‐crafted jewelry

00:15:01,672 --> 00:15:04,241
but at an attainable
price point for women,

00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:06,544
that that might be something
that they would want.

00:15:06,544 --> 00:15:07,745
Today, Kendra Scott Jewelry

00:15:07,745 --> 00:15:10,714
is valued
at over a billion dollars.

00:15:10,714 --> 00:15:14,218

in the United States

00:15:14,218 --> 00:15:16,887
to be the founder
of a billion‐dollar company

00:15:16,887 --> 00:15:19,623
is absolutely unbelievable.

00:15:19,623 --> 00:15:22,426
Right now, only 17%
of venture capital

00:15:22,426 --> 00:15:24,261
goes to women‐founded companies,

00:15:24,261 --> 00:15:26,063
and I think it is
my responsibility,

00:15:26,063 --> 00:15:28,065
along with all the women
of this generation,

00:15:28,065 --> 00:15:30,935
to start to change that.

00:15:30,935 --> 00:15:33,470
It's been a very hard year
for everybody,

‐How did you start making

00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,761
oatmeal balls?
How did this start?

00:17:37,761 --> 00:17:39,329
At 16 years old,

00:17:39,329 --> 00:17:42,433
I had my first opportunity
to work in a restaurant.

00:17:42,433 --> 00:17:45,502
I started off as a busboy,
then a food runner.

00:17:45,502 --> 00:17:48,472
In the middle of a shift
on a Saturday night, a cook ‐‐

00:17:48,472 --> 00:17:51,241
I guess it was too busy.
A cook walked off the line.

00:17:51,241 --> 00:17:52,843
The owner comes running in.

00:17:52,843 --> 00:17:55,079
She's like,
"Hey, I need a cook."

00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:58,248
And that was over 16 years ago,
and I never looked back.

00:17:58,248 --> 00:18:01,652
So, basically, after that stint
in the restaurant,

00:18:01,652 --> 00:18:05,656
I decided, "Okay, this is
what I want to do with my life,"

00:18:05,656 --> 00:18:07,524
and so I embarked
on my culinary journey.

00:18:07,524 --> 00:18:09,159
I got to work at awesome places

00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:12,629
like Four Seasons Philadelphia,
W Hotels,

00:18:12,629 --> 00:18:16,533
and most recent, Hyatt Regency
in Tysons Corner.

00:18:16,533 --> 00:18:18,502
‐Wow.
‐And so, I was the head chef.

00:18:18,502 --> 00:18:20,504
They asked me
to write a breakfast menu

00:18:20,504 --> 00:18:23,507
that our guests
could easily pick up,

00:18:23,507 --> 00:18:25,976
walk around the hotel with
without making a mess.

00:18:25,976 --> 00:18:28,112
The response that I got,
I was like, "Wait a second.

00:18:28,112 --> 00:18:30,180
There's something different
about this one."

So, that was in 2015.

with the rest of the world."

00:18:35,085 --> 00:18:36,487
Nahum, I have to interrupt you.
I love that story.

00:18:36,487 --> 00:18:38,489
This ‐‐
I'm an oatmeal lover.

00:18:38,489 --> 00:18:40,457
Ah.
This is better than oatmeal.

00:18:40,457 --> 00:18:42,226
It is so good.
It's really, really,
really good, man.

00:18:42,226 --> 00:18:44,561
It's crispy on the outside,
and it's creamy on the inside.

00:18:44,561 --> 00:18:46,330
Let me just tell you ‐‐
I don't eat breakfast.

00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,233
I'm not a breakfast eater.
I would eat this all day.

00:18:49,233 --> 00:18:51,268
And I'm always
running late...

00:18:51,268 --> 00:18:52,770
Yeah.
...'cause I have three boys.

00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:55,339
And getting them out the door
in the morning is a nightmare,

00:18:55,339 --> 00:18:57,474
so we'll do cereal bars
or something if they're ‐‐

00:18:57,474 --> 00:18:58,809
You know, I'll have breakfast
sometimes served,

00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:00,844
and they never have time.
They're getting their backpacks.

00:19:00,844 --> 00:19:02,346
They're throwing their stuff in.
Yeah.

00:19:02,346 --> 00:19:04,681
So, this is really cute
as a package,

00:19:04,681 --> 00:19:07,050
but the whole point is,
is that you've got to heat it.

00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:09,353
No. So ‐‐ So, wait for this one.

00:19:09,353 --> 00:19:11,088
‐Okay. Waiting for it.
‐Wait for it.

00:19:11,088 --> 00:19:14,091
That box can go into the oven
and be baked.

00:19:14,091 --> 00:19:15,225
‐Wow.
‐What?

00:19:15,225 --> 00:19:16,994
‐Well, there you go.
‐The reason ‐‐

00:19:16,994 --> 00:19:18,228
Okay.
‐Just like this?

00:19:18,228 --> 00:19:19,730
Yes. Just like that. Yes.

00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,331
How long do you
have to bake this?

00:19:21,331 --> 00:19:22,900
How long does that take?
‐So, from frozen,

00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,235
it takes about 10 to 15 minutes.

00:19:25,235 --> 00:19:28,272
Oh. But it says microwave
for 30 to 60 seconds.

00:19:28,272 --> 00:19:29,740
Greiner:
Wait, you can microwave it?

00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,308
‐That's the microwave option.
‐Mark.

00:19:31,308 --> 00:19:33,777
When you're hungry and you want
something you trust,

00:19:33,777 --> 00:19:36,780
and particularly if I could take
something like this in the box,

00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,016
pop it in the microwave
for a minute,

00:19:39,016 --> 00:19:42,419
grab and go and drive and eat,
'cause I'm a driver‐eater.

00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:44,621
Me, too. It must be
a Texas thing, don't you think?

00:19:44,621 --> 00:19:45,856
‐Must be, right?
‐Yeah. Must be.

00:19:45,856 --> 00:19:47,791
Must be. And so,
that's efficiency to me.

00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:50,627
So, do you sell them like this
or only like this?

00:19:50,627 --> 00:19:54,131
So, right now, we ‐‐ we're
selling them in the pouches.

00:19:54,131 --> 00:19:55,432
Oh. Wow.

00:19:55,432 --> 00:19:56,600

‐So let's talk about your sales.
‐Sure.

00:20:12,616 --> 00:20:15,853
First year,
we did $13,000 in sales.

00:20:15,853 --> 00:20:17,387
And what year was that?

00:20:17,387 --> 00:20:20,324
2017. 2018, we did $57,000.

00:20:20,324 --> 00:20:22,125
Okay. And 2019?

00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,628
2019 was about $54,000
to $57,000.

00:20:24,628 --> 00:20:26,730
It was pretty much flat.

00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,165
And how are you selling them?

00:20:28,165 --> 00:20:31,068
March of 2017,
I walked into a Whole Foods.

00:20:31,068 --> 00:20:33,370
At that time, Whole Foods
was allowed to bring in

00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,606
local products in their region.

00:20:35,606 --> 00:20:37,941
And so, while I still had
my full‐time job,

00:20:37,941 --> 00:20:40,777
I'm going into production
during the week ‐‐

00:20:40,777 --> 00:20:41,812

You're putting them

00:20:42,846 --> 00:20:43,947
and delivering them
to the stores?

00:20:43,947 --> 00:20:45,349
‐Yes. Yes, sir.
‐At least you're hustling

00:20:45,349 --> 00:20:46,917
to see if there's any
proof of concept, right?

00:20:46,917 --> 00:20:48,018
Exactly. I'm proving
the concept.

‐Yes.

So, you're working
a full‐time job still?

00:20:51,655 --> 00:20:55,058
I got laid off in March

00:20:55,058 --> 00:20:57,327
All our hotel business left.

00:20:57,327 --> 00:20:58,929
‐Oh, my.
‐I know for a lot of people,

00:20:58,929 --> 00:21:02,032

00:21:04,334 --> 00:21:06,003
‐Yeah. I think so, too.
‐...you know, from God,

00:21:06,003 --> 00:21:08,272
because I get to work on GoOats
full‐time.

00:21:08,272 --> 00:21:10,741
So, what do you sell
this bag for?

00:21:10,741 --> 00:21:13,277
I sell it into distribution
at $2.66.

00:21:13,277 --> 00:21:14,311
‐That's all?
‐Yeah.

00:21:14,311 --> 00:21:15,712
And what does it
cost you to make?

00:21:15,712 --> 00:21:17,948
$1.35.

00:21:17,948 --> 00:21:19,750
Well, that's the problem.
You're not charging enough.

00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,151
They sell it for $4.99.

00:21:21,151 --> 00:21:22,853
That's not enough.

00:21:22,853 --> 00:21:24,221
‐Okay.
‐That is not enough.

company in the United States,

the second‐largest food company,

and then I became the go‐to guy

00:36:35,531 --> 00:36:37,800

chocolates with gels

a little bit about ‐‐

00:37:12,869 --> 00:37:14,337
That's not that impressive
in the snack category.

00:37:14,337 --> 00:37:17,340
It's not. But I started
4 1/2 years ago with this brand.

00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,208
Now I own
a manufacturing facility,

00:37:19,208 --> 00:37:20,543
and there's a reason for that.

00:37:20,543 --> 00:37:22,478
The peanuts,
it's a great product,

00:37:22,478 --> 00:37:24,313
but my core manufacturers
hate it.

00:37:24,313 --> 00:37:25,948
They hate it
because it contaminates

00:37:25,948 --> 00:37:27,383
everything else that they make
in the same line.

00:37:27,383 --> 00:37:28,718
‐Oh.
‐Right?

00:37:28,718 --> 00:37:31,554
Because of the contamination
of peanut oils, right?

00:37:31,554 --> 00:37:32,922
Correct. It got to a point

00:37:32,922 --> 00:37:34,457
it was like,
"I need to buy my own line,"

00:37:34,457 --> 00:37:37,660
because there isn't any company
in the East Coast

00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,395
that could make this product.

00:37:39,395 --> 00:37:41,597
And we didn't get going
until 2019,

00:37:41,597 --> 00:37:44,433
and, therefore,
that's why the sales are there.

00:37:44,433 --> 00:37:48,704
So, because you got kicked out
of facility after facility,

00:37:48,704 --> 00:37:50,640
you decided to open
your own facility?
Yeah, so I decided

00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,009
to borrow $250,000
from my brothers.

00:37:53,009 --> 00:37:54,043
Wow.

00:37:54,043 --> 00:37:55,711
And I put in my own line.

00:37:55,711 --> 00:37:57,580
So, you put 250K into that?

00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:01,117
And $135,000 of my own,
so $375,000 total.

00:38:01,117 --> 00:38:02,785

been like year to date?

So, what, you've done $65,000
halfway through the year?

00:38:07,957 --> 00:38:10,192
Right. COVID‐19 had
a big effect on us.

00:38:10,192 --> 00:38:12,295
It sounds like
you're gonna be flat

00:38:12,295 --> 00:38:14,964

$110,000 this year.

00:38:14,964 --> 00:38:17,099
