I went through a period
in my life

And I've always
been confident,

with my confidence
during that time.

Who wouldn't? My God.
Yes.

00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,957
And the last year's
helped me a lot,

so I don't want you
to just think of this

00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:27,928
as a lash company.

00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:30,864
I look at this as a way
for professional women

to own whatever room
they come in

00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,764
Cuban: Who knew you liked ‐‐
Everyone loves cheese!
Come on!

00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,599
Everybody loves cheese.
I was born in
the diary state.

00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,101
I'm a Wisconsin‐‐
Oh, I'm well aware.

00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,836
I've been doing
a lot of research.
So I can come up and taste?
I'm so excited.

00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:38,604
Yeah, so, if you want to
come over here.
Okay.

00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,573
That one over there
is for you.
Oh, this side. Okay.

00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:42,608
So, it's really simple
and easy to use.

00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,910
How you do it is,
you pull right here on the side

00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,611
to remove the lid.
Mm‐hmm. Okay.

00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,346
The second step is,
raise the handle

00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:47,914
to the raised position.

00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:49,682
And then, it's like
the guillotine.

00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:51,517
I just made a nice thick
slice, though, I think.

00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:52,752
And then you got
a perfect slice.

00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:53,853
Oh, and then it's like
a little escal‐‐
Yep.

00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:55,955
Like a little, like,
moving sidewalk.
Yep.

00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,890
The wheels move it.
And then, so, how to know

00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,992
how thick or how thin
your slice?

00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:02,862
You just kind of
eyeball it on the side?
Yeah, you just eyeball it.

00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:04,096
And that was one
of the things we've learned

00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,631
talking to customers.
I'm gonna try
to do a big one.

00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,766
A lot of people have
a big preference

00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:08,568
of thin slice
or thick slice.

00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,703
So, what do you do about
the wheel when it comes off?

00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,004
[ Laughs ] The wheel
shouldn't come off.

00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,973
It does snap
back together.
It does? Okay.

00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,775
Tell you, this a very thin
slice of cheese.

00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:17,743
It's good.
Okay, wait, this came
completely out.

00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:19,779
Just push it right back in?
Yep, you push it
right back in.

00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:20,847
That's actually
how you swap handles.

00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:22,949
So, in the bag,
you've got handles

00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:25,852
with a grater, a blade,
and the wire.

00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:27,920
Can you tell me how
you came up with the idea?

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,690
This came about ‐‐
I was living on the river

00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,558
with a bunch of buddies,
and we ‐‐

00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:33,626
Living on a river.
Oh, man.

00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:34,760
It was on
the Willamette River.

00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,662
We were the poorest people
on the river by tenfold

00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,764
and had more fun
than everyone else combined.

00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:39,966
Always.
Oh, it was great.

00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:41,634
So, you know, naturally,
we've got the dock,

00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:42,902
and we're barbecuing
all the time.

00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:44,704
Sunday, we come
clean up the pigsty,

00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:45,905
and there'd be half a brick
sitting there,

00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:48,774
another quarter in the fridge
that no one put away.

00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:49,842
We're like,
"Man, this is ridiculous."

00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,777
And then, finally,
one afternoon,

00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,679
we're sitting there
having a margarita.

00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,748
All of a sudden,
screams from the kitchen.

00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:56,916
My friend had
cut her finger...
[ Gasps ]

00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,584
Corcoran: Oh, boy.
...chopping cheese.

00:16:58,584 --> 00:16:59,886
So, we get her
kind of doctored up,

00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:01,587
and we're like, "Guys,
there's gotta be a better way."

00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:02,588
So, we looked
on the Internet,

00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:03,756
and there was
absolutely nothing.

00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,825
Mm.
So, we went
to the shop ‐‐

00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:08,828
to my garage ‐‐ and the first
Cheese Chopper was born.

00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:10,897
Greiner: Aww.
I love that.

00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:12,131
And then I had
some old modeling clay and stuff

00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:14,700
from some old projects we did,
so we put it all together.

00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,802
I'm like, "Holy smokes,
this thing kind of works."

00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:19,739
[ Laughing ]
This is the 39th prototype
we've gone through.

00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:20,840
O'Leary: So, it's still a
prototype or are you actually ‐‐
39th?

00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,908
No, I'm sorry. So ‐‐
Wait, wait.

00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:23,476
39th?
Are you actually
shipping it?

00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:24,477
39th.
Wow.

00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:25,545
You're actually
shipping this product?

00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:26,779
We're not currently
shipping it yet.

00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,782
So, we have $125,000
in presales that we did.

00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:30,850
This is at Kickstarter?
Was it Kickstarter, or...

00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,386
Kickstarter, yeah.
So, we did a Kickstarter.

00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,388
Started at the end of April.

00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,389
We ended up raising ‐‐

00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:37,056
This year?
This year.

00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,825
So, this is pre‐sales,
pre‐shipping of the product.

00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,961
Correct, but those are
out of our injection molds.

00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:43,930
We hit couple speed bumps
just with COVID

00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,064
and the manufacturing
and whatnot.

00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,000
I got these three days
before I left for the show.

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,936
Scott: Really?
So, talk about
cutting it close.

00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:52,838
You don't take ‐‐ You probably
know I'm Chef Wonderful.

00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:55,474
There's lots of
alternative ways...
You do not sell cheese.

00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:56,676
....to cut cheese.
Correct.

00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:57,910
Number one,
as you know...
Here it goes.

00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,813
...this device is sold
by itself to slice cheese.

00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,583
Correct. The biggest
differentiation for us is,

00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,686
we are the only one
that slices, shreds, and stores.

00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:08,721
And we actually do have a
pending utility patent on that.

00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:10,723
What's the price gonna be
of this product?

00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:12,725
So, the retail price
on that is $39.99.

00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:14,560
And that's delivered door ‐‐
And the cost to make it?

00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,896
So, it costs me
$6.65 to make.

00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:18,664
By the time you package,
ship it, land it,

00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:21,567
we're at $8.30
landed in the warehouse.

00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,703
Okay, so, when you went
and put this on Kickstarter,

00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:24,971
how much did you
try to raise?

00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:28,174
So, our goal was $15,000.
And how much did you do?

00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:29,775
$100,436.

00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:30,810
That's amazing.
Wow!

00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:31,911
What do you think
brought all the traffic?

00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:34,714
So, we drove a lot of it
with Instagram,

00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:36,616
Facebook, social media,
but we also had ‐‐

00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,851
the Kickstarter community
bought a lot.

00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,052
Did they?
There was a lot of them.

00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:42,555
Yeah, so, we've sold another
25 grand since Kickstarter.

00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:43,823
Zero marketing,
zero advertising,

00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:45,625
Word of mouth, people just
finding our website.

00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,827
So, of the $125,000
in sales,

00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:50,830
it's gonna cost us $47,000
to fulfill all those orders.

00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,833
We've spent $29,000
on our marketing,

00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,435
our content, our ad spend,
everything else,

00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:58,371
which leaves us
$49,000 profit.

00:18:58,371 --> 00:18:58,871
Tate, look, you know,

00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,673
congratulations
on what you've done.

00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:03,776
The challenge with
Kickstarter‐driven sales is,

00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:06,812
you don't really have
a lot of customer feedback yet,

00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,681
not even minimal
customer feedback, right?

00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:10,616
Right.
Because you're waiting
for the first units.

00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:11,817
And so,
the challenge there ‐‐

00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,986
because you have to
deliver en masse,

00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,490
if one little thing is wrong
or the customer expectation

00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,625
doesn't match up
with what you deliver,

00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,861
now, all of a sudden,
that $47,000

00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:24,630
or whatever it is
in profit ‐‐ gone.

00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,965
And not only
is that gone,

00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:27,867
you've got to deal with
reputational issues.

00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:30,536
You've got to figure out
how to solve the problem.

00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,438
Things tend to cascade
very quickly

00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:33,806
and go south very quickly.

00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:36,642
And so, for those
reasons, I'm out.
All right.

00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,978
Sorry to hear that,
but fair enough.

00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:42,581
Tate, I would have loved to have
customer feedback on this.

00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:43,716
No question, all right?

00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:45,818
I know you're almost
pre‐revenue in the sense

00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:47,586
that Kickstarter, to me,
doesn't mean much.

00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:50,456
What matters to me
is a long history ‐‐

00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:51,857
at least a year worth
of sales ‐‐

00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,427
'cause I actually think
your price point of $39.95

00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:55,761
is $10 too high.
Okay.

00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,430
It's a $29.95 item.

00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,698
Your competition is this.

00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,599
I cut cheese like crazy
with this device

00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,802
and a cylindrical
shredding device,

00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:04,637
but they're really
inexpensive.

00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,872
You know, the one thing
that it has merit for

00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,842
that I'll give you is ‐‐ the
storage aspect is interesting.

00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:12,178
Right.
The valuation's not crazy.

00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:12,878
$750,000.

00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,980
I just ‐‐ There's not
enough data here for me.

00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,416
Okay, fair enough,
so just ‐‐
Sorry, I'm out.

00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,651
Okay, fair enough.

00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:19,785
Just to kind of
touch on ‐‐
Scott: You know, look...

00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:22,254
Yep.
I'm the dairy state
girl over here.

00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:23,055
I love cheese.

00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,624
But I've got to tell you,
this needs some work.

00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,860
When I was trying to do it,
it did get stuck.

00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,629
And you may need
further testing,

00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:33,933
further time to perfect it,
because on Mark's point,

00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:36,469
if you don't have
the product right

00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:37,803
and you ship it out too soon

00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:41,407
and you disappoint
your customer, you've lost.

00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,576
This product
has to be perfect.

00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,644
For all of those
reasons, I'm out,

00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:46,746
but I congratulate you

00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,482
on taking that risk,
taking that chance.

00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:51,684
Good luck.
Thank you.

00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:53,719
Greiner: You know, let me
tell you a little story.

00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,688
So, aerodynamically,

00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:57,590
the bumblebee should not
be able to fly.

00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,826
Its little wings are too small
for its fat little body,

00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:03,696
but, yet,
the bumblebee flies.
[ Laughs ]

00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:06,398
So, even if you don't
know something,

00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:07,767
you will make it happen.

00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:11,470
Unfortunately, here,
it's so early

00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,806
that I can't be
your queen bee here.

00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:15,875
But I know that you will
make things happen,

00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:19,478
I know you will work it out,
and so, I wish you good luck,

00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,847
but, unfortunately,
I'm out.

00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:23,883
Corcoran: You know what's
great about you, Tate?
What's that?

00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:25,885
For every 10 people
who have an idea,

00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:29,488
one person maybe eventually
does something with it.

00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:30,756
You saw it,
and the same day,

00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:31,891
you turned around
and got it going,

00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:33,659
and you actually
turned out a product.

00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,828
And you raised funding
on Kickstarter.

00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:37,029
There's probably
a thousand people

00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,799
who couldn't do that,
so you've got a great start.
Right.

00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,801
I think the weakness
to your product,

00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:45,704
from my view as a consumer,
is that I love cheese,

00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:46,872
and I typically have
four or five

00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:48,707
kinds of cheeses
in my fridge.
Right.

00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:51,443
And they probably all store
in that kind of space ‐‐

00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:52,711
that much space.

00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:54,747
So I can't envision myself

00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:56,816
using all this space
to store one cheese,

00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:59,985
and then having three or four
more in addition to that.
Okay.

00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,788
And so, it's not a product
that appeals to me,

00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:04,824
but that doesn't mean
it wouldn't appeal to everybody.

00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:09,662

how quickly you got it going,
