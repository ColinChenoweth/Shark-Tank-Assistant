00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,612
your boat, your coolers,
your ‐‐ your birdbath.

00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,647
Okay, Tyler.
We get it.

00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:44,684
Indoors or out, the Scrubbie
will handle the chore.

00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:46,686
And we're confident
that with your help,

00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:48,554
we can make this
a success.

00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,722
Now, which one of
you Sharks

00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,358
is ready to
clean house with ‐‐

00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,861
Together: The Scrubbie!

00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:55,862
[ Chuckles ]
Good job, guys.

00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:56,896
So, is this
interchangeable?

00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,664
So this is your
scratchy side,

00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,066
this is your
soft side.
Yes, exactly.

00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,868
And then it's disposable.
You just throw it away?

00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:04,537
Disposable as well.
It comes with...
And you get refills.

00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:05,605
It comes with
three sponges.

00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:06,806
How much does it cost?

00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:08,708
$14.99 is what
we're selling it for.

00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,543
And what are
the replacement sponges?

00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:12,845
Well, we're selling them for
$9.99 for three of them,

00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,447
and that's on
a subscription base,

00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:16,716
so every two months,
you get three sponges.

00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:18,217
A Scrubbie subscription?

00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,253
Scrubbie subscription.
I bet Scrub Daddy
doesn't have subscriptions.

00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,655
They don't need to.
O'Leary: Guys, can I just make
a comment about it?

00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:24,490
First time
I've ever seen it.

00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,025
It's ugly.

00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,628
I mean, it looks very,
very industrial to me.

00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:30,663
Hosey: If we wanted to
spend more money on it,

00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,598
we could have created
a better model,

00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,200
but we wanted to get
our margins, costs lower.

00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,371
So with this unit, we're paying
hardly next to nothing for it.

00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:39,405
We paid $3.16.

00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:40,773
Is it a prototype?

00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,475
These are
manufactured units.

00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:43,676
O'Leary:
What kind of sales we got?

00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,845
Okay, so 2019 ‐‐

00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:46,979
the Scrubbie's
an amazing product.

00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:49,282
It's one‐of‐a‐kind.
It's the first of its kind.

00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:53,386
Do you have a patent?
When we get the adjectives,
there's no number, that's bad.

00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:54,854
Yes, we have two patents,

00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:56,856
and one in the
application process.
Utility patent?

00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:58,791
One utility patent
and one pending.

00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,027
So, guys, tell us
about sales.
Is there a number?

00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:04,964
So, 2019, we did a launch
at a local trade show

00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,500
in Wichita, and we killed it ‐‐
everybody loved it.

00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,801
What's "killed it"?
O'Leary: And?

00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:12,305
So in those two days, we sold
a couple hundred Scrubbies.

00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,573
How many dollars?

00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:15,708
So, in dollar sense,
what we made at the show?

00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,344
No, just give me 2019 sales.
What did you sell?

00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:18,845
I've asked you five times.

00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:21,547
So, total,
we sold 868 Scrubbies.

00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:22,648
How many dollars is that?

00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,151
That is right around
$13,000.

00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:25,818
Ohh.

00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,954
Now, what's this year
gonna look like?

00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:30,590
Yep, sales wise, we ‐‐
we, business‐wise,

00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,657
we did
some online marketing.

00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,959
We didn't have
enough funds to do...

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,061
Last year.
...a successful online
marketing campaign and content.

00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:38,564
It's never good
when Mr. Wonderful,
who loves numbers,

00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,800
asks you what were
sales in 2019?

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,035
What are sales in 2020?

00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:44,937
I mean, just give me
a number.

00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:48,608
Right, so, total sales
to date is 868.

00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:49,575
Dollars?

00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:51,244
868 Scrubbies.

00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,846
Tyler, why can't you answer
Kevin's question?

00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,816
Yeah, no, so, totally ‐‐
Tell us your
forecast for this year.

00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:59,652
Sales this year,
the forecast for this year,

00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:01,921
if we are predictive
from other companies

00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:03,556
that want to do
business with us,

00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,491
their projection's
that we will do

00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:06,859
around $320,000 this year.

00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,861
Yeah, so they're just guessing.
There's no real <i>there</i> there.

00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,730
Right? That's the problem.
That's why you're here.

00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,598
So have you sold
to any stores

00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:13,699
and put these up
at stores?

00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,568
We haven't sold
to any stores, no.

00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,970
We're not in retail.

00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:19,939
Greiner:
So, I'm curious.

00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:22,475
Have you been watching
"Shark Tank" a long time?

00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:23,643
Yes.
Yes, seen a lot
of them.

00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:24,744
Greiner: Seen a lot
of them.

00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:27,780
Who did your packaging
and your logo?

00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,850
One of our graphic designers.
It was a friend of mine.

00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,685
I want to go back to numbers.
So, I have a question.

00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:33,986
And I only have
two questions ‐‐
Kevin.

00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:36,122
Lori, I got the patent thing.
Why did you so
rudely interrupt me?

00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:39,625
Remember, Lori, I'm working
on anger management this season.

00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,794
I know, and your
anger management classes
are not working.

00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:42,895
I just ‐‐ I can't
take it anymore.

00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,530
I have to ask a question.
I have to ask a question.

00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,465
Oh, my God.
You are so rude.
Very simple.

00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,534
Very simple.
Just two numbers.

00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:50,336
I'm begging for two numbers.

00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,572
Lifetime sales to date.

00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,673
$13,000.

00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:54,707
No, all in.

00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:56,909
So, lifetime sales
is $13,000.

00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,845
This business is not worth
a million dollars.

00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,748
In February, we got pretty
excited at the trade show.

00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,684
We were the busiest
booth there.

00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:06,652
We must have had 50 people
come up to us

00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:08,588
and tell us, "You guys
need to be on 'Shark Tank.'"

00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:09,722
Why didn't you sell it?

00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:11,223
We got the call
the very next day

00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,959
to get on "Shark Tank."
Cuban: You still could
keep on selling.

00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:16,562
Look, guys, do you know
what a 24,000 box score is?

00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:18,731
It's when a guy
plays 24 minutes

00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:23,402
and gets zero points,
zero assists, and zero rebounds.

00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:25,671
Wow.
It's noteworthy because

00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,540
if you play 24 minutes,

00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,642
something should
fall in your lap, right?

00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:31,544
A ball should come
your way, roll your way.

00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:34,246
You accidentally trip
and pass the ball.

00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:35,481
You guys sold nothing.

00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,717
You guys are
a 24,000 box score.

00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,819
Because just out of chance,

00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:42,588
some lightning,
something should have been sold,

00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:43,623
and you couldn't find
a way to sell anything.

00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:44,857
Dakin: We had
the opportunity.

00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,025
We were approached
by a company

00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:47,860
that did want ‐‐
No, no, no,
that's not the point.

00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,196
That's not the point.
It's that ourselves
should have gone out ‐‐

00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:50,763
Yeah.

00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,765
We wanted to go out
and knock on every door

00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:53,833
that we possibly could,

00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,569
but we also wanted
to protect our idea.

00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:57,937
So we went back to
our patent attorney

00:18:57,937 --> 00:19:00,973
and claimed everything.
It doesn't matter!

00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,576
‐We wanted to ‐‐
‐If I have to tell you ‐‐
‐It doesn't matter!

00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:04,777
It's just another excuse.
Cuban: It doesn't matter!

00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:07,613
Right. Look, I've heard every
eeny‐meeny‐miny‐mo excuse, guys.

00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,982
We wanted to...
I'm out.

00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:17,823
Does it not bother you that you
designed something that looks,

00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,726
from a logo,
name perspective,

00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:24,830
almost exactly like another
product Lori invested in

00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,132
that shall remain nameless?
You think it looks similar to ‐‐

00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:28,634
It doesn't bother you?
I mean, the name kind of
sounds the same,

00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:29,935
but that's not the same.

00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:32,905
Okay, so I'm glad that
Robert brought that up.
Not necessarily.

00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:35,741
I was about to before I was
so <i>rudely</i> interrupted.

00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,677
Are you going to sue them
into the Stone Age?

00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:40,713
So, wait,
here's the thing, guys.

00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:44,517
Your logo is so close
to Scrub Daddy's.

00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,786
You used the same
font, right?

00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:48,621
But Scrub Daddy? Scrubbie?
Hosey: For the record,
we thought of this

00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:49,955
before Scrub Daddy
existed.

00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:52,558
Did you think about this
while you were doing it?

00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,026
Not at all.
It never crossed your mind?

00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:57,697
'Cause it's really,
very coincidental...
Really?

00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,732
...that it's
the same font.
Honestly, no.

00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:01,534
When our designer
came up with this,

00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:02,635
we thought
it looked great.

00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:05,571
When your logo's really close,
I don't like that,

00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:06,639
and I don't want confusion
on the market.

00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:09,141
‐So ‐‐
‐I'm out.

00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,479
The ‐‐ The Scrub Daddy
doesn't have an attachment

00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:14,980
that connects to
your sink sprayer.

00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,049
And you also don't
have to use your hands.
Our is not the sponge.
It is the attachment.

00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,519
The future of our product,
we foresee different attachments

00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:21,754
for different purposes

00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:23,522
to be able to
screw onto the Scrubbie.

00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:24,957
Yeah, with a plastic thread,

00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:26,959
you can have the car Scrubbie,
the dog Scrubbie.

00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,095
Guys, I actually found this
intriguing.

00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:32,064
But, you know, when I started my
first company out of law school,

00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,867
PeaceWorks, to promote peace
between Arabs and Israelis,

00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:39,271
there was not a period
of one day, let alone one year,

00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:39,805
where I just waited.

00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:41,674
Like, it was about survival.

00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:43,676
I had to figure it out.
We didn't ‐‐

00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:44,944
And I eventually decoded it.
We didn't have to wait.

00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:48,748
And the fact that you went
for such a long period

00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,584
trying to figure things out
concerns me a great deal.

00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,452
And for that reason,
I'm out.

00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,488
Thank you.

00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:56,956
Yeah, guys,
you know, to that point,

00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:59,725
I mean, to me, there's
two types of entrepreneurs.

00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:03,696
There's the hungry,
and there's the satisfied,

00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:05,731
and you've been doing this
for two years.

00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:08,501
You don't have that
desperation of hunger

00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:10,636
that you wake up
and you got to sell, man.

00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,271
Right. So ‐‐

00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,305
I'm out.

00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:17,710
