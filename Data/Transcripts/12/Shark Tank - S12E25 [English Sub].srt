00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:19,192
Our single, individual
pour‐overs

00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,461
allow for anyone
to make a gourmet coffee

00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:24,364
without any additional
equipment.

00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:27,333
Simply take your pour‐over,

00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:31,404
open it up, and grab
your biodegradable filter.

00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:35,241
Gently hang it over your cup,
and then tear off the top,

00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:38,277
and then pour hot water
over the organic grounds

00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:41,314
and immediately watch
as your organic coffee

00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:42,648
drips directly into the cup.

00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:45,485
And we partner with
the best farms in Vietnam

00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:48,054
to bring the absolute
best Vietnamese coffee

00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:48,755
to the U. S.

00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:52,458
Once brewed, then you get to add
your Copper Cow Creamer,

00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:55,261
and there is nothing else
like it on the market ‐‐

00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:58,231
there are no preservatives
or additives.

00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,466
And then stir,
and within seconds,

00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,435
you will be sipping on your own

00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:05,772
perfectly balanced
Vietnamese coffee.

00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:10,276
So Sharks, tell me ‐‐ who's
ready to be their own barista?

00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:11,477
O'Leary: Tell us about
what's in front of us, Debbie.

00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:12,612
Yeah, so, what you have
in front of you

00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:15,381
is a sampling of
our best‐selling products.

00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,216
You, of course,
have the classic,

00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,351
which is what I just made here,

00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,219
that comes with
the milk and sugar.

00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,188
But we also have it just black.

00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:23,456
And then on your far right,

00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:26,192
you've got our churro
and our lavender.

00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:27,527
They're natural infusions,

00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:30,129
and trust me,
they're all delicious.

00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,197
I got to tell you, you know,

00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:33,366
this packaging is
absolutely incredible.

00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,435
Thank you.
And I just came back
from Ho Chi Minh,

00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:39,272
and I stood on line
two hours

00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,573
for one coffee shop.
Yup.

00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:41,674
Now, I learned how to ‐‐
Herjavec: Really?

00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,409
Now, are you telling me
that I didn't have to

00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,411
wait out there
for two hours?

00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:48,147
Nope. And you don't need to buy
any additional equipment.

00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,649
This is great.
Why is it so sweet?

00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:53,252
Well, we do sell it just black,
but we do find that most ‐‐

00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:54,654
just like most Americans
drink their coffee

00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:56,689
with milk and sugar, that's how
most people want to buy it.

00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:59,358
Robert, that's the culture.
Philippines, Vietnam...

00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:00,726
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
...that's the profile.

00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:03,663
That's the
flavor profile.
It's actually normally
much sweeter in Vietnam.

00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:06,065
Yeah.
It's like it packs
a punch, for sure.

00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:06,566
So, what's your story?
Ohh.

00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:08,935
How did you come up
with this?

00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:10,102
Yes, so my background is,

00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:12,138
is that I went to M. I. T.
and Berkeley.

00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,606
I ended up working
at the World Bank

00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:15,475
in finance supply‐chain
management,

00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:18,478
and I wanted to do something
that really was more creative,

00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:21,180
something where I could go
a million miles per hour.

00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,315
During the last year
at the World Bank,

00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,449
I did this on the side.

00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,551
I was on the subway with
a duffel bag full of samples

00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:28,354
selling door to door
to get into our first 30 stores

00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:31,190
and, you know, was manufacturing
and living with my sister,

00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,358
making it out of her garage.

00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:33,359
When was this?

00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,161
This was four years ago.

00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:38,331
What I think is
really cool is this.

00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,166
I've never seen
anything like it.

00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,268
It's really clever,
this packaging.

00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:44,570
Yes.
Did you create
this yourself?

00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,440
We perfected it in terms of
exactly the brew that we want,

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,809
but it's actually a technology
that's very common in Japan...

00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:52,478
It's fantastic.
...and so we're the first people
to be bringing it over.

00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,347
And how much does this
sell for?

00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,349
$15 for five servings,

00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,217
and it costs us $3.10
to make it.

00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:00,453
So it's premium coffee.
It's premium coffee.

00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:02,355
So I took it
to the Fancy Food Show,

00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:06,359
and I was chosen
as the Innovation of the Show,

00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,461
Really?
and so we got into
a thousand stores that month.

00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:10,396
What year was that?
2017.

00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:12,865
So total sales to date
is $4 million.

00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:13,499
$4 million?!

00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,334
$4 million all ‐‐
People, let her
go through.

00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,335
Please, go ahead.

00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,004
2017, $170,000.

00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:19,105
OK. '18?

00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:21,908
And then in 2018,
we make $500,000.

00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:22,441
OK, then?

00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:25,077
Then in '19,
we make $1.6 million.

00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:26,145
Whoa!
And year to date?

00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:28,114
Year to date
is $2 million.
Wow.

00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:29,248
Tell me
the margins, now.

00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:31,350
Now we have
a 70% margin.
Greiner: Wow.

00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,320
So you're doing $2 million
year to date, right?
Yes. Yes.

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,389
So what percentage of that
is online?

00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:37,623
That's 80% online.

00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,258
Wow. There you go.
OK, so that's your real
business outlet.

00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:40,259
80%.

00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,494
You've evolved
from being retail,

00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:42,528
which is good
for you now, right?
Mullin: Right.

00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:43,696
And retail ‐‐
we're still in retail.

00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:46,365
That 20% is ‐‐
that's from a growing number.

00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:49,435
Last year, when your sales
were $1.6 million,

00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,370
how much money
did you lose?

00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,438
We lost $1.4 million.

00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:54,040
‐What!
‐Whoa!
‐$1.4 million?

00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:57,977
Did you get an outside
investment in '18?

00:17:57,977 --> 00:17:59,045
We raised $2 million.

00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:01,347
How much cash
do you have in the bank?

00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:02,582
We have $1.5 million.

00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,250
Did you generate
enough margins ‐‐
Did you raise more money?

00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,118
Sorry, Mark.
Wait. We did.
We did raise more money.

00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:06,752
Ah, there you go.

00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:10,590
So, the existing investors
invested another 1.5.

00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,258
At what valuation?
And what was
the valuation then?

00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,326
$15 million.

00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:14,427
Sharks: 15?!
Mullin: Yes.

00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,395
What you're asking today.
Yes.

00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:18,297
That's insane!

00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,399
So personally, like,

00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:23,169
I like very,
very weak coffee

00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:26,172
and I love to get behind
what I do a deal with.

00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:29,008
But the packaging,
I don't think,

00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:31,344
conveys what
this is about.

00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:33,212
It says "pour‐over set."

00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:34,413
If I walked by this
in a store,

00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,415
I would have thought
it was some type of glass.

00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,218
That's why I think that
the digital is working for you

00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,220
and the stores
not so much.

00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,255
So, I love the idea,

00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,958
I think you're smart as can be,
very cool,

00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,259
but I'm out.

00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:48,394
♪♪

00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:50,563
You seem to grow
in plateaus.

00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:51,697
You seem to get to
a point...
Right.

00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:54,300
...something happens,
you raise money.
Right.

00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,368
You're at that plateau.

00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:56,602
How do you get to
that next step?

00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:58,537
Right. What's your secret sauce?
What's your secret sauce?

00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:01,407
What's happening now is that,
you know, we've grown a lot ‐‐

00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:03,442
like this past month,
we made $350,000,

00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:06,512
and again, really,
really close to breaking even.

00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:09,215
How much you think
you'll lose this year?

00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:11,384
We'll probably lose
around $700,000.

00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:12,485
Lose $700,000?
O'Leary: $700,000.

00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,320
But that's OK.
That's not the issue for you.

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,521
Why is it always OK,
Mark?

00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:18,324
That's because if
you can grow your way
out of those losses ‐‐

00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,625
if you can keep on growing...
Right. Right.

00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,361
Then let me just work with
the numbers for a second.

00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,363
Wait, wait. Wait, no.
Let her answer my question.

00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,432
Can we hear the answer
to the question?

00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:29,168
Which question? Is it OK
to lose money every year?

00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,302
Which one do we have here?
What I ‐‐

00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:31,537
What I'm really excited about
in the next phase

00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:35,141
is that we made $250,000
online last month.

00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:36,175
O'Leary: OK.

00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,310
What did you make
in profit from that?

00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,346
So we made about $120,000.

00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:43,315
So the real question becomes,
your next six months,

00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,151
what are you
going to do in revenue,

00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:46,419
and what are you
going to do in profits?

00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:50,156
In the next six months, we plan
to make another $3.5 million

00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:51,357
In sales.
In sales.

00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,392
Then we were planning to
make $500,000 profit there.

00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:54,460
There we go.
So that's ‐‐

00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,495
That'll be the first time.
First time. Mm‐hmm.

00:19:56,495 --> 00:20:00,166
So I have to pay
a $15 million valuation

00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:03,235
to see if maybe,
for the first time ever,

00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:06,272
this 4‐year‐old business can go
cash flow positive, right?

00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:07,306
And that's really common,
though,

00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,442
with a consumer
packaged‐goods business.

00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:10,543
You've raised
a ton of money,

00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:11,610
burned through
quite a bit of it.

00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,080
How much do you still own
of the company?

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,347
I still own 40%.

00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:18,384
So you've lost control of it
through these raises, right?

00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,352
Uh, technically, yes.

00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:25,357
You know, Debbie,
this is a very expensive bet

00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:26,959
that I'm not
going to take.

00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:27,960
I'm out.

00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:31,363
Debbie, you want me to ‐‐
you want me to be ‐‐

00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:32,298
you want me
to tell you the truth?

00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:34,033
Yes.

00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:36,068
This?
Amazing, right?

00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,369
Thank you.

00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:42,141
Lost $700,000 then lost
another couple of million,

00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:44,410
have 1.4 million
in the bank.

00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,611
You burn through all
that money, and you go,

00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:48,347
"Well, that's very common
in a startup."

00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:51,117
What would the everyday person
say about that right now?

00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:53,358
I was trying to
potty train my daughter.

00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:54,459
She was struggling,

00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:58,363
so I quit my job
to potty train her.

00:34:58,363 --> 00:34:59,931
‐You quit your job?
‐You quit your job?

00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:00,432
I quit my job.

00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:01,600
To potty train
your child?

00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,468
Yeah, because when the child
is afraid

00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:06,338
of going down on the potty,
they won't go.

00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:09,674
My daughter is deathly afraid.
It can be really stressful.

00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:12,611
Yeah. So when they are
really afraid, they hold it.

00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,613
Yes.
And then ‐‐ So that's
what happened to my daughter.

00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:17,515
So the magic moment was when
she, with her own words ‐‐

00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:19,584
she was almost 3 ‐‐
she said, like,

00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:22,220
"If you sit on the toilet,
I'll sit with you."

00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,090
So this is what I did.

00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:27,258
I sat down on
the toilet with her,

00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:28,326
she sat in front of me,

00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:31,396
so my stomach
became her back support

00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:34,466
and she went number two
several times that day.

00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:37,068
So that worked because
you were there with her?

00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:38,203
Yes, I thought, at some point,

00:35:38,203 --> 00:35:40,138
I cannot be on the toilet
the whole day with her.

00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,073
[ Laughter ]

00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:43,308
So, I'm a legal assistant.

00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:45,343
I used all that background
that I have,

00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:47,512
and I said,
"I have an invention."

00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:50,315
So that day, I did
all the legal research

00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:52,017
and I filed for a patent.

00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:53,685
I have my utility patent.

00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:55,353
And Chris, what do you do?
What's your background?

00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:56,421
Herjavec:
And who are you?

00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:58,289
OK, so I'm a guy

00:35:58,289 --> 00:35:59,624
that comes out of
corporate America.

00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:02,160
I'm on patents
for Ford Motor Company

00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,662
and ran BMW plants.

00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:06,331
So, I come into play here
with the manufacturing side,

00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:09,234
where we can do all of this
in the USA,

00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:11,770
and we can do it for $2.30
for my cost.

00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:15,106
Wow.
And with higher volume,
I can do it below $2.

00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:16,408
Let's talk about sales.

00:36:16,408 --> 00:36:19,844
OK, so we launched this
in March.

00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:20,445
Wow.

00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:24,015
Lots of good sales volume
with a big, big box.

00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,150
Who?
Walmart.

00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,418
OK, sales, sales.

00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:30,488
So, in six months,
we're at $65,000 in sales.

00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:31,923
How many stores are you in?

00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:33,091
Just under 400.

00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:34,459
Chris, that's not exciting.

00:36:34,459 --> 00:36:36,628
What's your packaging
look like? Do we see it?
That's it.

00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:38,630
Just this?
With the sticker?
No, it's in a display box.

So, now, Walmart's going to
carry us through next spring.

00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:55,547
Yes.
And they made a commitment
to put us in 4,800 stores

00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:58,116
which is a $1.1 million P. O.
Yes.

00:36:58,116 --> 00:37:00,351
And Menards
just made a commitment

Yes.

what does that mean?

00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:59,310
So Walmart said,
with the pandemic, right,

00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:02,514
everybody's sales were flat
completely for two months.

00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:04,282
There was nobody

Not digital direct.

kids are still pooing

who we license it to

what this needs right now,

and you will not regret it.
