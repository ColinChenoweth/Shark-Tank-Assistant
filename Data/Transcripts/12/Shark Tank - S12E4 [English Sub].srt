All you have is a package
with our dry mix,

and then you just add
3/4 cup of water...

and it was always our goal
to start a business together.

00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,467

to the country.

00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,936
My mom's side's from Cameroon.
My dad's side is from Nigeria.

They immigrated here
to the U. S.,

and all my life, I watched
my parents grind and hustle

00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,476
just to make ends meet
and put foods on our plate.

00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,478
I graduated high school

wasn't my passion.

00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,019

Music was always
something I loved,

00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:48,722
and so I left engineering,

00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:51,658
and I went down to Los Angeles
to pursue music.

00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:54,127

I picked a secure field,
and I pursued medicine.

00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,575
When I got into medical
school, they told me,

When you go to a

pepper, chicken salt.

Everyone uses chicken salt.

00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,902
So we took the chicken salt
from Australia,

00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:11,071
we made it vegan,
we got rid of the chicken stock,

00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:13,907
we got rid of the MSG,
and we lowered the sodium.

00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:17,010
What's your average selling
price and your average cost?

00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,478
Yeah, so,
it costs us 80 cents

On Amazon,

What are you gonna do this year?

We're projected to do
$500,000 this year.

00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,105

we're not just
a seasoning company.

00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,209

My mom was not happy,

but this time, I was like,
"I have to go out on my own."

00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,744
So, it's 3:00 A. M.

00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:47,112
My uncle calls me.

00:35:47,112 --> 00:35:49,114
My uncle's an engineer at NASA,
and he's telling me about

00:35:49,114 --> 00:35:51,616
this project he's working on
called the Space Launch System.

00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:53,385
And he ends up just talking
about how he's working through

00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:54,786
some stuff, and he's gonna
use this adhesive.

00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:56,087
Wait, your uncle called you
at 3:00 A. M.?

00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:57,689
My uncle always calls
at 3:00 A. M.

00:35:57,689 --> 00:35:59,090

the time he's up.

00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,825
[ Laughter ]

00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,627

00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:04,195
"Man, this adhesive
sounds interesting.

00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:07,032
You know what? This could work
on a cellphone."

00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:09,200
So I started doing research.
I get on YouTube.

00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,635
I teach myself
to write a patent,

00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:12,203
I teach myself
to write a trademark,

00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:14,205
and I launch
my Kickstarter campaign.

00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:16,508
And that's how
I got here today.

00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,777
This film is not
proprietary, right?

00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:20,712
That's correct.
I can buy
rolls of this myself.

00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:21,813
That's correct.

00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:24,482
So, the difference
is the design.

00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:26,518
So we actually have filed
for a utility patent,

00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,653
and it's for having
a double‐sided adhesive

00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:31,122
on the phone
and the flap cover.

00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:33,191
What does it cost to make,
and what do you sell them for?

00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,493
On average, it costs us
58 cents to make.

00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:37,195
We sell these for $15.
Whoa.

00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,064
However, often,
we sell them in bundles,

00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:42,967
so it's one for $15,
two for $25, or three for $30.

00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:44,369
Those are some margins
right there.

killing it.

Our total sales to date is
$115,000 in about 2 1/2 years.
