Yeah.

00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:18,959
That was so hard!

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,527
As I mentioned,
it's made from real fire hose,

00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:22,295
and the original intent

00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:25,065
was to mimic a fire hose
charged with water.

00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:27,334
Oh.
When I joined
my volunteer fire department,

00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:28,435
I noticed there was a gap

00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,470
between the fitness training
in the gym

00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,806
and what really happened
out there on the fire ground.

00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:35,308
The obvious place to start
was how to mimic charged hose

00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:37,144
without pulling hose
off the trucks,

00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:39,112
charging it on
the hydrant with water.

00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,015
Once we had prototyped this
in the firehouse,

00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,417
I then went to
the FDNY Training Academy,

00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:47,220
the premier institution
for training in the world

00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,421
for firefighters,

00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,590
and I walked into
the fitness director's office.

00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,559
I said, "I've got something
special for you to see,"

00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:54,995
and there was a moment of magic.

00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:58,965
He immediately agreed,
and the FDNY was my first

00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,534

on our fire service side.

00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:01,935
Good for you.
Good for you.

00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:03,904
I want to understand
two things.

00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:06,273
One, what did you do
in the military?

00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:10,377
And number two, why did you join
to be a volunteer firefighter?

00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:13,680
When I was looking at college,
the ROTC scholarship

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,750
was an option
to pay tuition to Princeton.

00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,519
And so I left college and went
straight into the military

00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,354
as a second lieutenant

00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,657
and, after nine months
of training,

00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,760
was on a charter aircraft
to Mosul

00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,029
to support the
101st Airborne Division's

00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:31,331
reconstruction of northern Iraq.

00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,634
So I was
a 23‐year‐old platoon leader,

00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:37,737
and my youngest soldier ‐‐

00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,973
I lost my youngest soldier
under my command.

00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:42,209
He was 19 at the time.

00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:45,078
And I remember that night,

00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,347
huddling my platoon up
around me

00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,183
and kneeling down
in the center,

00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,486
and I just thought,
"This is the moment.

00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:55,889
This is one of the most
important moments of my life,"

00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,158
that leadership moment
to get us through.

00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:02,128
So when I left the service,
I really ‐‐

00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:04,197
there was something
really powerful about

00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:08,134
that community
and camaraderie that I missed.

00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:11,104
And I vowed that
I would always work to honor

00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:14,474
the memory
of that soldier that I lost.

00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,776
And so I did my MBA,

00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:21,514
and I was also pregnant
with my first baby girl.

00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:24,184
And I was feeling, like,
this desire

00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:25,919
to have the camaraderie back.

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,555
I thought that joining the local
volunteer fire department

00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,223
would be a great way to just

00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,425
keep that thread of public
service in my life.

00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:35,528
Where did you find time
to spend two years doing an MBA?

00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:38,164

of Business at Dartmouth.

Also, importantly, in terms of
the scalability of our business,

00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,585

of different markets there.

was for what period?

00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:04,617
what looks to be the way

00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,753
that we can scale
the company forward

00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:11,057
is to pivot and to build
a direct‐to‐consumer brand.

00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:13,493
What are your sales
since you made that pivot?

00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,628

in April and May timeframe

00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,397
had $40,000 in sales.

How did you get
those customers?

00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,538
What were you doing? Videos?
Did you spend digitally?

00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:28,041
Did you start trying
different ads on Facebook?

00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:31,444
We did. And when we did that,
we launched an iOS app

00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:34,247
that has
a 150‐plus movement library

00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,915
that's developed
by my training partners,

00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:37,417
who are the best
in the business.

00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:41,554
We launched also a live online
training platform program.

00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,590
Do you charge for the app?
So I'm following you.

00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,158
I'm watching you.
I'm in my home.

00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:48,028
I'm watching my video,
and it's you doing it with me.
Yes.

00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,629
And what do I pay for that?

00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,664
Right, so the app model is that
it's a free download.

00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:52,799
That's free.

00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:53,900
Lubetzky: So if
I'm understanding correctly,

00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,336
the app is designed
to create demand,

00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:58,872
and then you want people
to download it for free

00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,640
so that they can
order these from you.

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,743

a $19‐a‐month option

then have ‐‐

Introducing LIFTiD
Neurostimulation.

00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:40,500
LIFTiD utilizes
a process called

00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:45,638
transcranial direct current
stimulation, or tDCS.

00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:48,774
Our device uses
a mild electric current

00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,943
that passes through
two electrodes

00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,179
placed on the upper
forehead area

00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,947
known as the frontal lobe,

00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:57,950
a part of the brain that
when stimulated

00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,721
has been shown to increase
focus, attention, and memory.

00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:05,591
A stimulation session lasts
20 minutes once a day

00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:08,027
while a user
is performing a task,

00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,097

we would love to do

00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,490
a LIFTiD stimulation session

00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:40,993
It is so safe.

00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,262

in front of you

00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:46,132
is a kit that has everything
that you will need

00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:49,302

00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:58,037
So this device, you are supposed
to be doing something

00:18:58,037 --> 00:19:01,574
to get your brain working
and focusing on something,

00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:04,977
and that's how you improve
your focus.

00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,746
Cuban: Well, I'm gonna
ramp it down, guys.

00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:10,249
How do you know something
won't go wrong?

00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,051
Well, first of all...
That's a great question.

00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:16,188
...tDCS is backed by
5,000 published studies.

00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:19,358
They are using it
for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's...

00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,160
Any evidence it works?
...for epilepsy.

00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,696
What is it doing
for those things, specifically?

00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:26,599
The brain
has billions of neurons,

00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:29,902
and in those billions
of neurons, most are dormant.

00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:32,438
So when you're doing
a stimulation session

00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:35,107
and you're doing, like,
for example, a spreadsheet,

00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,476
what's happening
is called neuroplasticity.

00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,578
That means
the more you do that,

00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:42,515
the more those neurons
are likely to fire

00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:43,516
the next time you do it.

00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:44,650

They're landed for $22

00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,326
So how many dollars
is that, Ken?

00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:36,529

I have to feel that
I can show efficacy 100%,

Your job is to get me
to share that passion,

00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:25,010

is just to talk over everybody.

00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,212
It's difficult. Yes.

00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:30,649
The nicest thing I can say

And it may well be true.

00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:41,060

‐Yeah.

00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:16,735
Well, it's, one,
by myself doing this.

00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:19,270
I had a full‐time job for
the first five of the six years.

00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,172
There wasn't
a huge marketing budget.

00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:23,174
We've put in about
$600,000

00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:26,811
between myself, family,
and some friends.

00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:28,079
Wow.
Yeah.

00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,416
Tell us your story.
Why are you doing this?

00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:34,886
I was born in Ethiopia.
I grew up in Kenya.

00:37:34,886 --> 00:37:38,490
My father was in agriculture
and always in outdoors,

00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:40,859
used to grow up going on safari.

00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:42,560
Came to the US.

00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,130
I went on to study
environmental economics

00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:47,132
and also have an MBA in finance.

00:37:47,132 --> 00:37:49,234
So I was able to put
all these things together

00:37:49,234 --> 00:37:52,437
and come out with a product
that would promote my interests

00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,205
and also address

00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:56,708
some of the environmental
and social concerns.

00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:58,276
When you came out,
I saw honey wine.

00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,278
I thought, "Aw,
kind of a shtick."
Yeah.

00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:03,348
And then I tried it,
and I loved it.

00:38:03,348 --> 00:38:05,016
Now I'll buy it.

00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:07,485
I'm going to guess
the problem with your product

00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:09,754
is people aren't going to buy it
until they try it.

00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:10,955
Exactly.
And that's why we got ‐‐

00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,323
Well, I think
there's a bigger problem.

00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:14,192
I think it's price,
'cause $39.95,

00:38:14,192 --> 00:38:16,261
that's not a price
you would sample new wine at.

00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:17,595
Here's a fact.

00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:20,632
97% of wine sold in America

00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,967
is sold
for under $14 a bottle.

00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,936
97%.

00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:26,437
What's your cost
for this bottle?

00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:28,173
That's $5.93.

00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:31,609
So why are you selling it
so expensively when you can get

00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:33,178
to that $14.99
price point?

00:38:33,178 --> 00:38:35,847
Because, I mean,
it's just classical strategy.

00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:38,183
Either you're small volume,
high margin or ‐‐

00:38:38,183 --> 00:38:40,351
So how's that strategy
working for you?

00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:42,353
It's a long‐term play because
this is gonna grow over time.

00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:44,355
Greiner: Well, it's something
you could change.

00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:46,057
You've got
to have an introductory.

00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:47,859
You've got to have a price point
where people can ‐‐

00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:49,561
No, but, Mark, I think you're
going down the wrong road.

00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:51,462
I don't think it matters
what the price is.

00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:53,965
And yes,
97% are sold to that.
Greiner: I do.
I think it matters a lot.

00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:55,733
A Sauvignon blanc costs $35.

00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:57,969
The problem here
is people need to try it.

00:38:57,969 --> 00:38:59,170
Well, that's my point,
Robert.

00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,338
Mark is right on the money.

00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,974
It's that sweet spot
of being under $15, right?

00:39:02,974 --> 00:39:05,076
‐Yeah.
‐And if it's not what you like,

00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:06,911
you haven't
really lost that much.
Exactly.

00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:10,081
I like all wines,
and I appreciate the mastery

00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:12,750
of what you've made here,
but two big issues here.

00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,453
One is getting trial.
I think Robert brought that up.

00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:18,756
Breaching the $14
price point is very hard.

00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:19,757
Very hard.

00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:21,492
‐Well, I mean,
lowering the price

00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:23,461
is not going to
get people to buy more.

00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:26,130
We've experimented with that,
and it's not sustainable.

00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:29,834
I'm not sure about that.
That's 97% of the market.

00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:33,538
Let's focus on the issue
of valuation.

00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:37,242
You have to ship
50,000 cases to break even.

00:39:37,242 --> 00:39:38,776
How many cases
are you shipping?

00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:39,978
Yeah.

00:39:39,978 --> 00:39:42,013
Well, I was doing about
400 or 500 cases a year.

00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:43,815
400 or 500?
Yeah.

00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:46,384
You know what?
I'm a product person.

00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,519

about wines, frankly.

Tastes good.
Looks good.

00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:57,562
First white wine I've liked,
and I like all four.

00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,497

'cause this is the only way
we're going to get four in.

00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:02,627
So you're going to have to say
yes to the 40%.
