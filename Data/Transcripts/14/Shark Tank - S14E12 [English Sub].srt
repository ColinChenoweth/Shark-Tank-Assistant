I have been a musician
my entire life.

00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:09,623
And I thought that that was
my purpose on Earth.

00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:12,159
I used to be the lead singer
of a Latin alternative band

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,960
called Pistolero,
I sang in Spanish.

00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,362
And so it seems like
a big jump to go

00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,931
from a lead singer of a band
to running a beauty company.

00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,566
But, really,
the mission is the same,
right?

00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,168

I am making people feel seen,
making them feel proud.

00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,872
Because I live in New York,
very expensive city,

00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,040
I always had to
have a day job,

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,743
so I worked as a sales rep
for CPG brands,

00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:33,180
but I found myself
unemployed at the age of 43

00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,649
a couple of summers ago
with student loan debt,

00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,818
credit card debt,
and a child to raise.

00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:40,754
I knew that the only way
I was going to change my life

00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,489
was to create something bigger

00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:44,691
than I had ever actually
been a part of before.

00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,526
The answer wasn't going to be
working for

00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:49,830
yet another CPG brand that
wasn't going to pay me enough.

00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,399
And so I started
to build this brand.

00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,468
One of the things that I did
was invest in myself

00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:56,603
by enrolling
in formulation school.

00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:59,573
I said, why does this brand
not already exist?

00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:02,409
Latinos are the largest
minority group in this
country,

00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:07,214
and yet we have been
conditioned to aspire to
Eurocentric brands

00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:08,715
with French and Italian names.

00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,250
So what's driving me

00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,753
is really I want to show
my community what is possible.

00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,888
I don't want to aspire
to be like someone else.

00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,656
We want to aspire
to be ourselves.

00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:19,059
So it's not just for Latinas,
though. It's for everybody.

00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:21,461

my first full year of

00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,074
$607,000 in sales.

00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:35,442

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,056
So our business is pretty
much 50/50 D2C, 50% wholesale.

00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:51,324
And of the wholesale,

00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:53,660

Cuban: Good for you.
Greiner: Wow.

00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,834
I said bravo because I do
think, you know, from launch

00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:04,271
to get to $600,000, $300,000
I think is very respectable.

00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:05,872
But how do you impute
a $6 million

00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:07,140
valuation on the business?
Yes.

00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,708
That's very hard
to justify.

00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:12,546
I have meetings booked with
the two top beauty retailers

00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:13,880

I moved to New Orleans
about eight years ago,

reason I started this
business,

00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:24,270
my father in 2010 was
diagnosed with heart disease.

00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,938
And so as a family,

00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:29,541
we all started to take a
closer look at our health and
wellness

00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,243
and -- and I became
very interested in nutrition.

00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,745

a hobby of mine.

doing before this?

of a tortilla chip.

but I also,
in my work for that company,

00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:43,449
discovered the sacha inchi
