Before I started
The Woobles,

I used to lead user experience
for Google Classroom.

Oh, really?
And I spent the bulk
of my career

00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:07,347
as a UX designer
working on education products.

00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,549

I was great at it.

I was so great that
they made me a manager,

And so to take
my mind off of work,

00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,025
I started dabbling in
all these other hobbies,

00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:20,961
and crochet was
one of those things.

00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:23,396
And learning to crochet
reminded me that I still

00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:25,766
have it in me to
learn something new,

00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,335
that I could try to become
a better manager.

00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:30,570
And so that experience
of really building

00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,572
back my confidence
through crochet

00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:33,707

And what's your
background?

00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,253
From a really young age,
I've been taught that success

00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:48,688
means getting good grades,
going to a good school,

00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,557
and getting
a really high-paying job.

00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:51,925
And that's
exactly what I did.

00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:54,294
So I became one of the youngest
directors on Wall Street.

00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,596
I traded billions of dollars
in equities.

00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,398
Wow.
But I wasn't any happier

00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,167
at the end of it
than when I started.

00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:02,669
And what I began to realize
was that I had spent

00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,838
all that time working
towards someone else's

00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:06,640
definition of success.

00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,708
And so I left it
all behind to go

00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,878
and try and figure out what
my own definition of success is.

00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,446
I knew from
a really young age

00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:15,315
that I really liked
helping people,

00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,818
and then when we started
thinking about crochet kits,

00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,786
what's really neat about it
is that it is that

00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:20,954
confidence boost.

00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:23,256
Sometimes as we get older,
you kind of stop

00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,025
learning new things,
you start saying things like,

00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,593
"You know,
I'm too old to learn that."

00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:29,129
And so what brings me joy
with these kits

00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:30,831
is that they're
a little confidence boost

00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,600
to remind you that you can
always learn something new.

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,070
So exactly two years ago,
we started this business.

00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,506
We took $200,
we bought some yarn,

00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:40,707
and we bought
a domain name.

00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:43,810
And since then,
we've done $5.3 million.

What are you gonna do --
Yeah, so year to date,

00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:50,584
we've done $3.1 million.

00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:52,819
And if we assume
that we just stop growing

00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,755
from this point on out,
we'll do $7 million this year.

00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:58,191
Cuban: You're dir--
Okay, you're direct to consumer,

00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,694
which means you're doing
a lot of online advertising.

00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,797
So tell us what your cost
to acquire these revenues are,

00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:05,065
what your
gross margins are,

00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:06,766
and what your
net margins are.

00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:10,237
Yeah, so we spend about 20%
of our revenue on advertising.

00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:11,204
Okay, that's not bad.

00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,807
It costs us a blended CAC
of $16.

00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:16,576
The average order value
is around $57.

00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:17,911
Okay.

00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:19,746
Wow. And they order one a kit
or more than one kit?

00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,381
So that's about two kits.

00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,016
Then you're making
a lot of money.

00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:27,988
So 86% gross margin,
32% net margin lifetime,

00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:29,556
and 38% year to date.

00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:30,857
Great margins.

00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,293
So why do you need $250,000?
I mean, you're killing it.

00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:34,661

for three reasons.

wholesale, and mentorship.

when a customer
finishes the kit,

00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:43,036
the first thing they think is,
"I need to get another kit."

00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:44,738

they start asking us,

more about what -- what
the mission really is.

for that learning,

in your vision,
always gonna be crochet?

Meaning is the next product
that you have coming,

00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,721
a non-crochet
or some other form?

00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:36,423
Yes, the -- the key
to our business

00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:37,991
is the "learn to" part.

can change.

focused on crochet.

00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,690
And I'm Kirk.
And we're here from the home

00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,794
of the Pro Football
Hall of Fame -- Canton, Ohio.

00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:39,598
We're here seeking $100,000
for a 10% stake in our company.

00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:42,368
Sharks, have you ever cooked
a chicken that was so dry

00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:43,736
it was barely edible?

00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:45,704
Or served a turkey at
Thanksgiving

00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:48,641
that was so parched your guests
wanted to offer it a drink?

00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,975
Well, that's
why we created...

00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,544
the Turbo Trusser!
The Turbo Trusser!

00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:54,680
The Turbo Trusser is
a rapid trussing device

00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,183
used when cooking
whole chickens and turkeys.

00:21:57,183 --> 00:22:01,821
Trussing is
a technique that...

00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,724
Trussing is
a technique that...

00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:08,093
Keeps the wings
and legs close to the body.
...keeps the wings
and legs close to the body.

00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:09,962
It cooks a bird
more evenly.

00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:11,130
Good save.

00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,365
Traditionally, this is done
with butcher's twine,

00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:16,035
which is messy
and hard to work with.

00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:17,436
And this is
for the birds.

00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:18,771
[ Chicken clucks ]

00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:20,639
But with the Turbo Trusser,
keeping your dinner

00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,374
nice and juicy
is a breeze.

00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:24,844
Just hook the Turbo Trusser
right into place.

00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,613
Closing up the cavity
and sealing all the juices

00:22:27,613 --> 00:22:30,249
to cook a perfect bird.

00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:32,084
Check out these
incredible results.

00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,152
Herjavec: Ooh!

00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:35,888
Sharks, you'll get
a delicious, juicy

00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:38,390
chicken or turkey
every time.

00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,626
And this product
is so universal,

00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:43,863
you can use it in ovens,
grills, smokers,

00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,131
roasters, rotisseries,
deep fryers,

00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:47,466
and heck,
even air fryers.

00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,602
And best of all, it's made
of food-grade stainless steel,

00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:50,836
and it's dishwasher safe.

00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:53,505
And it's made right here
in the good old USA.

00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:56,375
So which one of you Sharks
wants to take a bite

00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,910
out of the poultry
industry...

00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,512
Together: And make
a cluck load of money?

00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:01,981
So each one of you Sharks
on your table,

00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:03,616
you have samples
of our two versions.

00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:06,819
One's a chicken Turbo Trusser,
and one is made for turkeys.

00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:09,154
And then you also have
some chicken that was cooked

00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:10,723
with the Turbo Trusser
today.

00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,191
Kevin, we'd love
to have you come up.

00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:13,459
Go ahead and try it out.
I would love to.

00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:14,660
We've got a chef hat.

00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,562
You know, I am Chef Wonderful.
That's right.

00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,130
This is really good.
And of course,
we've got the apron.

00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,665
It is very good.

00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:21,267
[ Laughs ]

00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:22,701
That's good.

00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,770
Okay, you just pick
the Turbo Trusser up.

00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,872
Yeah.
And set it in the butt there.

00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,607
Okay. You set it
in the butt?

00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:30,542
Set it in the butt.
Okay, the butt cavity.

00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:31,777
And then lift the one leg up.
Oh, there we go.

00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,445
Lift one leg up
and put it in.

00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,047
Life the other leg up.
It's just that easy.

00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:36,415
It's just that easy.
Good.

00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,650
And then the other side,
do the same.

00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,752
What is the chicken community
saying about

00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:40,886
this torture device?

00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,388
They really like it.
[ Laughs ]

00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:45,157
We've sold about
11,000 units and had one return.

00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:46,659
Wow.
Wow.

00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:47,593
Very nice.

00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:48,761
Brian:
People really love it.

00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:50,195
You don't have to get
your hands all messy

00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:51,563
when you're using
butcher's twine.

00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:54,066
How much of this delicious
juiciness is because of this

00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:55,601
or the way you cooked it
in that particular oven?

00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,269
It's because of
the Turbo Trusser.

00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,470
That's what trussing
does it.

00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,872
It cooks it
so you're cooking

00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:01,607
one piece of meat
instead of five.

00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,709
So it's gonna
cook more evenly.

00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:05,511
I don't cook,
so I'm learning so much.

00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:07,479
Does everybody do this?

00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:08,981
You know what?
I think a lot of people do.

00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:11,784
But I think people are,
one, afraid to do it with twine

00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,419
'cause it's --
it's intimidating

00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:14,820
if you don't
know how to do it.
Oh, yeah, like, if you told me

00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,423
to tie up a dead chicken,
I'd be, like...

00:24:17,423 --> 00:24:20,326
Normally got to go online,
watch a 5- or 10-minute video.

00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:21,760
So, guys,
how did you get here?

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,996
You know, how did you get
in chicken suits

00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:26,699
on "Shark Tank", on the carpet?
Yeah, tell us your story.

00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:28,801
For the last 18 years,
I've been working

00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,102
in the pharmaceutical
industry.

00:24:30,102 --> 00:24:31,136
I've worked for three of
the largest

00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,571
pharmaceutical companies
in the world.

00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:35,341
But Kirk and I, we met about
five or six years ago.

00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:36,542
He was renovating
my house.

00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:39,178
I was a contractor
for 20 years.

00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:41,814
I went to culinary school
back in the early '90s.

00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:45,217
I was a sous chef in a -- in a
couple big banquet kitchens

00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,419
and country clubs,
but I got burnt out,

00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:49,188
and that's how I got
into contracting.

00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:51,490
As a contractor,
I found a problem

00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,725
with straight
shut-off valves.

00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:55,761
I invented a wrench
that has over 800 positions,

00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:57,396
and I have
two utility patents

00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:59,465
and I think five
design patents on it.

00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:01,066
And I ended up
licensing it.

00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:03,202
And then Brian's like, "I want
to start inventing, too.

00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:04,770
This is really cool."
And I'm like,

00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,071
"Okay, well, let's do it."
Yeah, it was that easy, right?

00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:08,107
We're gonna invent our way
into chicken suits.

00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:09,375
Right.

00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:12,044
We've invented personally
together six products,

00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:14,413
four in the barbecue industry,
two in the pet industry.

00:25:14,413 --> 00:25:15,614
And then he's got
a wrench.

00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:17,816
Before this product,
did you make any money?

00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:19,451
Not a dime.
No.

00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:20,519
[ Laughter ]
Not a dime.

00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,388
But you know what?
We kept inventing.

00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:24,256
O'Leary: Let's get back to this
product for a second.

00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:25,924
How much does it cost?

00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:28,994
How much do you make it for?
How many have you sold?

00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:31,930
So right now, it costs --
well, on our last order,

00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:35,968
it was $3.07 to make,
MSRP is $14.99.

00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:37,636
And how many have you
sold in dollars?

00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:39,238
$90,000 in sales.

00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:41,273
So we've been in business
for eight and a half months.

00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:44,510
60% of our sales
come from our website alone.

00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:47,179
27% of our sales
go through distributors.

00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:49,848
We have three distributors.
We're in 75 stores now.

00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:52,051
Oh, you are? And how is it
selling? Is it selling through?
Yep.

00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,385
Yep. Selling through.

00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,887
All three of our
distributors have reordered.

00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:56,722
We have somebody that's selling
on Amazon for us now.

00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,057
He's reordered
three times.

00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:00,459
Herjavec: Uh, Brian, I love you
guys. I love this thing.

00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:05,531
I know nothing about it.
It's just not big enough for me.

00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:06,698
Don't chicken out.

00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:07,800
[ Laughter ]

00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,334
Not yet.

00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:11,703
Our margin's 82%.

00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:13,138
O'Leary: He's a turkey.

00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:14,440
Well done.

00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,775
Brian, Kirk, I love it.
Not for me.

00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,077
Thank you. Thank you, Robert.
Thank you for your time.

00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:19,511
Appreciate it.
Brian, how would I make money

00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:20,813
on a deal like this?

00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:22,981
It seems like a little business,
a little bit of sales.

00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:26,118
Doesn't seem like there's room
for a third person by any means.

00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:27,453
Barbara,
that's a great question.

00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:29,021
87 million turkeys
are consumed

00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:30,222
just between
the three holidays

00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:32,291
of Thanksgiving,
Easter, and Christmas.

00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:34,426
We're not online
marketing experts, right?

00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,961
So we're
looking for somebody

00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:37,696
that can help us
with some marketing,

00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,364
get us some
social media exposure.

00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:42,434
But, guys, look, it's hard
to connect your product

00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,570
to all those turkeys
and chickens.

00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:47,005
I-I just don't see you
being able to scale,

00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,941
which makes it really
difficult as an investor.

00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,909
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:52,344
Thank you very much
for your time.
Thank you, Mark.

00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:55,047
So it's not
really investable for me.

00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:58,417
It's not big enough, and I
really hate touching chicken.

00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:00,986
So I just have to be honest
about that.

00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:04,056
[ Laughs ]
And for those reasons, I am out.

00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:05,424
But I think you'll do
really well.

00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:06,625
We appreciate that feedback.
Thank you.

00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,461
Brian, it's not
a big enough business for

00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,897
an investor to make money.

00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:13,232
I'm out.

00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:16,668
Brian, you've got -- you've got
one turkey left.

00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:19,671
O'Leary:
You know, guys, I look at this,

00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:22,875
and I see the potential of it,
but there's so much work.

00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:25,010
We don't want you guys to do
the work for us.

00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,345
We're gonna do the work.

00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:28,046
Listen, we're here.
We won't let you down.

00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:29,148
We just need
your connections.

00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:30,716
I mean, imagine if
Chef Wonderful

00:27:30,716 --> 00:27:32,184
took this under his wing.

00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:33,852
We would love to have
you under the wing.

00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:35,154
Would love that.
But he ain't free.

00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:36,588
He's an expensive chef.

00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:39,057
I mean, I wish you'd had a model
already put out there

00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:41,860
where I just had
to pour gasoline on it.

00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,695
They do. They have
a product here you can sell.

00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:46,965
So I have to don my whites.
I have to be Chef Wonderful.

00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:49,868
I have to sell a lot of these
to make any money.

00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:51,737
Um...

00:27:52,738 --> 00:27:54,573
I mean, I -- Ugh.

00:27:54,573 --> 00:27:56,041
We're flexible
in our equity.

costs $5.80 for me,

for $34.

00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:17,115

That's a big margin.

00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,819
On the sharp stuff, what
your cost is for one of these?

00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:22,921
Fleming: Okay.
And what you're gonna sell

00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:24,589
the one, three, and four pack,
I guess.

00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:29,861
Okay, so if we buy over
10,000 pieces of that,

00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:31,630
it's at 28 cents,

00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:35,200
and then we sell them
for $4 on the website.

00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,435
And then if you buy
a pack of five, it's $15.

00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:39,137
And what are you gonna
sell it for wholesale

00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,238
to the retailer?

00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:42,340
So I sell it
to them for $7.50,

00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,676
and then they're reselling it
for $14.99.

00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:48,179
So $7.50 for a pack of four.
And it cost you 28 cents?

00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:49,414
Yes. Thank you.

00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:50,949
Herjavec: Mark's gonna
start selling them.

00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:52,450
Braxton, can you tell us
a little bit about

00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,519
yourself
and your background?

00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:55,854
Absolutely. Absolutely.

00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:58,890
So I actually come from
two entrepreneurial parents,

00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,259
and as I was growing up,

00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:04,229
I was very accepted
in my family.

00:36:04,229 --> 00:36:06,331
You know, my parents loved me.
They never judged me.

00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:08,166
They let me be
whoever I wanted to be.

00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,368
And at the age of
27 years old, I said,

00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,437
"Something is missing
from my life."

00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:15,006
And that's when I realized
that I was transgender.

00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:18,877
And once I made that change,
as I was watching

00:36:18,877 --> 00:36:21,479
YouTube videos of other
trans men taking

00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:24,049
hormone replacement injections,
that's how I realized

00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:25,650
that there was
a need for this.

00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,820
And I was indirectly
assessing them

00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,889
with my nursing skills, saying,
"Oh, that's not safe."

00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:32,290
Like, they're putting it
in shoe boxes,

00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,025
they're putting it
in plastic bags.

00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,161
And that's when I said,
"You know, I really want

00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:39,864
to become a part of my community
because they've given me so much

00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,766
that I wanted to give back."

00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:44,669
I created this brand,
and it just blew up.

00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:46,471
Is it just you
running the business?

00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:47,839
It's all me.
I do everything.

00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,041
I literally work out
of my basement right now.

00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,810
I have all my product
down there.

00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,112
Are you still doing this
completely out of your basement?

00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:55,246
Yes. 100%.

00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,015
And are you nursing
still, or...?

00:36:57,015 --> 00:36:59,484
Yes, I've actually been trying
to slow down

00:36:59,484 --> 00:37:01,753
because I've been putting
more effort into the business.

00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:03,788
I'm just curious,
the logo,

00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:05,356
Stealth Bros and Co.

00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:06,858
Yes.
When you came out here,

00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:08,093
I thought --
Cuban: It's a great name now.

00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:10,662
Now that we know
and understand it, it's great.

00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:12,263
I'll explain the name.

00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:14,866
Stealth is because
I wanted people to be able

00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:16,601
to keep their
medication discreet.

00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:17,635
No, I get
the stealth part.

00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:19,404
Why the Bros and Co.
and the swords?

00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:21,306
And Bros is, we're built
on the foundation

00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:23,842
of the brotherhood of F-to-M --
female to male brotherhood.

00:37:23,842 --> 00:37:25,110
I see.

00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,979
And then "&amp; Co."
is &amp; communities

00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:29,814
that we keep,
our allied communities.

00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:31,449
That's great.
And then the swords

00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:34,152
are there for because
iron sharpens iron,

00:37:34,152 --> 00:37:36,488
and more than one community
coming together

00:37:36,488 --> 00:37:38,323
makes you better and stronger,
and that what --

00:37:38,323 --> 00:37:40,458
Do you have that up on your
website, the explanation?

00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,060
I actually do not.

00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,394
You should. It's cool.
I should. Thank you.

00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:44,529
You should.
That's very cool.

00:37:44,529 --> 00:37:45,730
And there should be
a video there

00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,932
of you explaining it
because the power

00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,400
of how you
just explained it...

00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,535
Yes.
Yeah.

00:37:50,535 --> 00:37:52,537
...that comes across
very, very well.

00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:53,705
Thank you.

00:37:53,705 --> 00:37:56,908
I think that it's kind of
the -- the perfect kit,

00:37:56,908 --> 00:37:59,077
and I love what you're doing
for the community.

00:37:59,077 --> 00:38:01,446
I don't think
you need a partner.

00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:03,915
I don't always say that.
I rarely say it.

00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:05,416
I think
you should run this.

00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,085
I think you should take
all the profit.

00:38:07,085 --> 00:38:09,220
And I think you should
grow step by step.

00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,755
And you're gonna have
a wonderful business

00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:12,290
and reap what you sow.

00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,994
And for those reasons, I wish
you good luck, but I'm out.

00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:17,962
Thank you, Lori.
I appreciate it.

00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,799
So, Braxton, the greatest
part of your business,

00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:22,700
not to diminish the other
parts of your business,

00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,868
is really you.
Thank you.

00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:27,005
I mean, you exude
an incredible warmth.

00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:28,139
Thank you.

00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,809
And personality
that draws people to you.

00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:31,843
Thank you.

00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:34,412
I think you've got
a good business.

00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:36,714
Just at the size
you are right now,

00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:38,349
just not something
for me.

00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:39,851
I'm out.
I wish you all the best.

00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:41,619
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,955
Corcoran: I've had some
personal experience.

00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:45,023
When I was trying
to get pregnant,

00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:46,891
I was doing in-vitro
for seven years

00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:48,660
to give birth to
my first born.
Wow.

00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,195
Thank God it worked.
Wow.

00:38:50,195 --> 00:38:51,462
God bless you.

00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:53,431
I remember being
in business meetings,

00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:54,833
in museums...
Yes.

00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:57,869
...in theaters where
it's time to take my big shot.

00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:59,437
Right.
It was just as big as this.

00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:00,939
Yeah.
With a big plunger.

00:39:00,939 --> 00:39:02,507
And it was made of oil
that burned when it went in.

00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:03,541
That's right.
It was horrible.

00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:04,609
Yeah.

00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:07,278
But the ingenious ways
I had to come up with

00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:08,913
just to hide that.

00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:10,081
Not that I was ashamed,

00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:11,449
but what do you do with
the damn needle?

00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:13,751
Right, right.
You know, my life had to go on.

00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:16,154
I used to carry
books with me,

00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:19,991
cut out pages in the middle,
cut a page, like a spot.

00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:20,959
Wow.
And carry the book

00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:22,093
and stick
the needles in there.

00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,795
Because you can't dispose
in a restroom.

00:39:23,795 --> 00:39:25,563
You can't throw it
in a garbage can.

00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:27,332
But let me
tell you something.

00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:30,201
You have genuine warmth
and love

00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,636

And you know what?

I'm a believer,
if you're that sincere...

00:39:36,274 --> 00:39:38,109
Yes.
...and you come from
that love spot...

Yes.
...people always do well.

It's like a magic wand.

00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:45,016

Barbara, do you want
any help?

00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:39,938
Or you want to
do it yourself?

00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,539
You want to jump in?
I think it's a good cause.

00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:42,740
Yeah, I'll split it with you
if you want.

00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,975
Yeah. Okay.

00:40:43,975 --> 00:40:45,343
I like the fact

Right.
But it's not a product

00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,014
Okay.
But I wish you the best.

00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:51,749

And Mark is still,
I believe.

00:40:57,722 --> 00:41:00,258
No, I'm -- I'm very interested,
and Barb and I were talking.

00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:01,526
From an operational
perspective,

00:41:01,526 --> 00:41:02,994
it's not just
a cash issue.

00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:04,662
It's building your
business issue, as well.

00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:05,663
Yes, it is.

00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:06,931
Because you're
doing it yourself,

00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:09,801
trying to scale it from
the basement to a business...

00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,469
Correct.
...is going to be
a lot of work,

00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,571
and I think between
our two organizations,

00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:16,074
we -- we can complement each
other to get you there.
Absolutely.

00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:19,043
And so if it works with you,
Barb and I will split it.

00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:23,948
So it's going to be $200,000,
$100,000 of that in cash,

00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:26,985
and $100,000 of that
as a line of credit for 20%.

Braxton?
