00:00:01,435 --> 00:00:03,570
I'm in, baby.
I'm in all day long.

00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,139
Narrator: There's only one...

00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:09,076
"Shark Tank",
the original business show.

00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:10,811
We're asking
for $100,000...

00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:12,012
...for a 15% stake.

00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,981
I would like 33 1/3%.
Ooh!

00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:15,148
Herjavec: Yowza!

00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:16,149
Narrator:
Through thick and thin,

00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,051
"Shark Tank" is still here.

00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:20,320
Uplifting...
I may only be 17,

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,189
but I was made to be
an entrepreneur.

00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,124
You have something
magical happening.

00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:26,093
You gotta pour fuel
on the fire.

00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:27,261
Narrator: ...inspiring...

00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:29,096
Grede: It's really difficult
for Black women.

00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:30,797
But guess who's sitting
right in front of you,

00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:33,200
who has done it
over and over again.

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,669
Narrator: ...a steadfast
champion for everyday Americans

00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:37,137
fulfilling their dreams.

00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,139
We've done over
$1.6 million.

00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:40,340
-Wow!
-Son of a gun!
-What?!

00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,543
Bananas to the moon, baby!

00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,746
Narrator: And this season,
exciting brand-new guest Sharks

00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:46,780
join the Tank.

00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,115
Gwyneth Paltrow.

00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:50,384
The Oscar-winning actress
is also a powerhouse

00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:53,987
entrepreneur and founder of
lifestyle juggernaut goop.

00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:56,089
Paltrow: We are putting
amazing things into the world.

00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:58,425
We have so many stories
of changing lives.

00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:01,161
Narrator: And Tony Xu, founder
of the largest food delivery

00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:03,430
platform in America, DoorDash.

00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,532
Xu: We contributed
almost $70 billion

00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:08,135
to the U. S. economy,
and we're just getting started.

00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:11,238
Narrator: And exciting titans of
business return to the Tank.

00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,574
I'm a brand builder. I built
my own from the ground up

00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:14,741
out of my extra bedroom.

00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,243
I bring a lot
to the party.

00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:18,111
You've got Mr. Wonderful
and Mr. Global.

00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:20,681
I love you, man, because
you're hanging by a thread

00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:22,215
and you don't give up.

00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:25,385
If either one of us
don't do this deal,

00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:27,154
our lives are not
gonna change.

00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:28,722
We're still gonna be
[bleep] rich.

00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:31,758
Narrator: The brand new season
has begun.

00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,895
Bad entrepreneur!
You've seen the show before!

00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:37,230
Wait, wait.
Did I hear a dollar a unit?

00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,833
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding.
No, no, Mr. Wonderful.
No, no, no, no, no.

00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,902
What if we could create
a new standard

00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:44,404
for the digital age and get
the whole world typing

00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:45,939
at the speed of thought?

00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,375
Wow.
Aah!

00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:51,078
I will work like a lion.
Bet on me.

00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:52,479
Aaah!
[ Laughs ]

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,449
Woman: I needed this so bad.
I'm just so thankful to God.

00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:59,486
I'm Mr. Wonderful.
I'm gonna make you filthy rich.

00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:08,629
â™ªâ™ª

00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:11,064
Narrator: First into the Tank
is an adorable way

00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,900
to learn a new skill.

00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,303
Corcoran: Hey.
Cuban: Oh, my goodness.

00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,473
[ Laughter ]

00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:22,676
Hey, Sharks. We're Justine.
And Adrian.

00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:25,646
The wife and husband team
behind The Woobles.

00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:28,982
Today we're seeking
a $250,000 investment

00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,385
in exchange for a 5% equity
in our company.

00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:32,552
-[ Chuckles ]
-Wow.

00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:35,455
Sharks, we're here
to get you hooked.

00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:36,957
On crochet.

00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,592
Our company is
The Woobles.

00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:41,795
We make fun, simple kits
that teach you how to crochet.

00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:43,897
But instead of
a boring potholder,

00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:46,700
you'll learn how to make
adorable characters like...

00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,536
Pierre the penguin
and Felix the fox.

00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:52,305
Fred the dino
and Sebastian the lion.

00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:54,207
Each kit comes with
step-by-step videos

00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:56,677
that teach complete beginners
how to crochet.

00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:59,780
Our secret -- we're not just
a crochet company.

00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,549
We see ourselves
as an education company, too.

00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,584
We've seen that something
magical happens

00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,086
when people
learn a new skill.

00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:07,521
It's about confidence.

00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,857
So, Sharks, who is ready
to Wooble with us?

00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:11,692
[ Laughter ]

00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,126
Super cute.
Thank you.

00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,428
Super cute.

00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:15,929
What you have in front
of you is both a kit

00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,664
and an example of
The Wooble

00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,399
that you would make
with this kit.

00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,034
And if you open up
the pouch,

00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,236
then you'll see
our easy peasy yarn.

00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,772
And then, most importantly,
there's a card inside

00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:28,675
of the pouch that has
a link and a QR code

00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:31,111
that brings you
to our website tutorial

00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:33,647
our customers will follow to
learn how to make that Wooble.

00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:37,718
What is the age
start for this?

00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,419
So most people will look
at our product

00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,688
and think that it's for kids,
but most of our customers

00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:44,458
are actually adults
buying it for themselves.

00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,826
And what do you sell
these for,

00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:46,793
and what do they cost
you to make?

00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,361
Landed, they're $3.

00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:50,931
We wholesale for $15,
and we retail for $30.

00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:52,099
Wow.
Herjavec: How do you sell them?

00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,334
Over 90% of our sales
are direct to consumer,

00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,103
straight from our website.

00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:58,205
Wow.
Corcoran: So what made you
crochet in the first place?

00:03:58,205 --> 00:03:59,706
Before I started
The Woobles,

00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:02,542
I used to lead user experience
for Google Classroom.

00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,344
Oh, really?
And I spent the bulk
of my career

00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:07,347
as a UX designer
working on education products.

00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,549
And I loved my job.
I was great at it.

00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,685
I was so great that
they made me a manager,

00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:14,221
and it turns out
I sucked at being a manager.

00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:15,288
[ Laughter ]

00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,023
And so to take
my mind off of work,

00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,025
I started dabbling in
all these other hobbies,

00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:20,961
and crochet was
one of those things.

00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:23,396
And learning to crochet
reminded me that I still

00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:25,766
have it in me to
learn something new,

00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,335
that I could try to become
a better manager.

00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:30,570
And so that experience
of really building

00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,572
back my confidence
through crochet

00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:33,707
is why we started this.

00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:34,941
I want to share that
experience.

00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,109
Are you still at Google?

00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,845
Oh, no, no, no.
This is a 100% full time.

00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:40,947
Is it full time
for both of you?

00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,015
Yes.
Yes.

00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,350
And what's your
background?

00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,253
From a really young age,
I've been taught that success

00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:48,688
means getting good grades,
going to a good school,

00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,557
and getting
a really high-paying job.

00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:51,925
And that's
exactly what I did.

00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:54,294
So I became one of the youngest
directors on Wall Street.

00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,596
I traded billions of dollars
in equities.

00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,398
Wow.
But I wasn't any happier

00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,167
at the end of it
than when I started.

00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:02,669
And what I began to realize
was that I had spent

00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,838
all that time working
towards someone else's

00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:06,640
definition of success.

00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,708
And so I left it
all behind to go

00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,878
and try and figure out what
my own definition of success is.

00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,446
I knew from
a really young age

00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:15,315
that I really liked
helping people,

00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,818
and then when we started
thinking about crochet kits,

00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,786
what's really neat about it
is that it is that

00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:20,954
confidence boost.

00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:23,256
Sometimes as we get older,
you kind of stop

00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,025
learning new things,
you start saying things like,

00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,593
"You know,
I'm too old to learn that."

00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:29,129
And so what brings me joy
with these kits

00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:30,831
is that they're
a little confidence boost

00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,600
to remind you that you can
always learn something new.

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,070
So exactly two years ago,
we started this business.

00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,506
We took $200,
we bought some yarn,

00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:40,707
and we bought
a domain name.

00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:43,810
And since then,
we've done $5.3 million.

00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,579
-Wow!
-Son of a gun!
-What?!

00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:46,613
Cuban: Good for you.

00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:47,881
What?!
That's incredible.

00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:49,249
What are you gonna do --
Yeah, so year to date,

00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:50,584
we've done $3.1 million.

00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:52,819
And if we assume
that we just stop growing

00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,755
from this point on out,
we'll do $7 million this year.

00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:58,191
Cuban: You're dir--
Okay, you're direct to consumer,

00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,694
which means you're doing
a lot of online advertising.

00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,797
So tell us what your cost
to acquire these revenues are,

00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:05,065
what your
gross margins are,

00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:06,766
and what your
net margins are.

00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:10,237
Yeah, so we spend about 20%
of our revenue on advertising.

00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:11,204
Okay, that's not bad.

00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,807
It costs us a blended CAC
of $16.

00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:16,576
The average order value
is around $57.

00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:17,911
Okay.

00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:19,746
Wow. And they order one a kit
or more than one kit?

00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,381
So that's about two kits.

00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,016
Then you're making
a lot of money.

00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:27,988
So 86% gross margin,
32% net margin lifetime,

00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:29,556
and 38% year to date.

00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:30,857
Great margins.

00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,293
So why do you need $250,000?
I mean, you're killing it.

00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:34,661
We're here
for three reasons.

00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:37,831
We're here for licensing,
wholesale, and mentorship.

00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:39,299
When it comes to licensing,

00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:40,834
when a customer
finishes the kit,

00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:43,036
the first thing they think is,
"I need to get another kit."

00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:44,738
And then
they start asking us,

00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,140
"Where's Baby Yoda? Do you have
any Disney characters?

00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,608
Where are
the Marvel characters at?"

00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,810
Guys, how did you arrive
at your valuation

00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,845
that you presented?

00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:54,214
Adrian: We know our valuation
is very low.

00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:55,548
Low?
It's low because --

00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:56,683
Yeah.
It's very low because

00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:59,252
we are here to make a deal.

00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,656
We can learn so much from this
group of people in this room,

00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:05,258
and the way we see it,
we have two huge opportunities

00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,459
ahead of us.

00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,228
We haven't even begun
to talk about wholesale,

00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:09,629
but licensing and wholesale

00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,698
we think can drive this brand
to the next level.

00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:13,066
You want to
go to retail?

00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:14,668
We want to go to retail.

00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:15,769
Why
when you're killing it?

00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,337
'Cause they have enough
margin. Yeah.

00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:19,072
We've -- We've done
a test order.

00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:22,676
So now we get a little
more about what -- what
the mission really is.

00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:25,478
Is the basis or the mechanism
for that learning,

00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,715
in your vision,
always gonna be crochet?

00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:32,385
Meaning is the next product
that you have coming,

00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,721
a non-crochet
or some other form?

00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:36,423
Yes, the -- the key
to our business

00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:37,991
is the "learn to" part.

00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,726
What we apply it to
can change.

00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:43,029
But right now, we are 100%
focused on crochet.

00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:45,365
So for the foreseeable future,
it's crochet kits.

00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:46,399
Justine:
Exactly, yep.

00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,734
I like this deal, okay?

00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:51,371
'Cause it has something
I love called cash flow.

00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:52,706
What does it have?
I love cash flow.

00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:55,108
And so, I see
it this way.

00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:59,346
I think I can reduce your costs
of acquiring customers

00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,414
by around 8% to 10%.

00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,117
Number two, I can definitely
help with licensing.

00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:06,820
Been there, done that
with lots and lots of brands.

00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,557
I also think I can help you with
some other interesting ideas

00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:13,693
in the fashion world
with this stuff, okay?

00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:14,894
The fashion world?

00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,463
This I can't wait
to hear.

00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:18,264
I'm gonna make you an offer.
Listen.
This is a far stretch.

00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,532
Do you want to hear
the offer or not?

00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:21,234
-We would love to.
-This is scary.

00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:26,439
I'll you the $250,000
for 10% equity.

00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,974
Coming from you,
Mr. Wonderful,

00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,642
I expected to
hear the word "loyalty."

00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:33,246
You know why? You know why?
You have cash flow.

00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,981
Would it be okay
if we just heard

00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,483
if any of the other Sharks
are interested, as well?

00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:38,852
Corcoran:
I would definitely.

00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,921
I'll give you $300,000
for the same 10%.

00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,158
Thank you.

00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:47,961
Greiner: I love this.
I'm gonna make you an offer.

00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:51,564
I'm gonna go
$300,000 for 10%.

00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,867
I-I understand
all of this.

00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:57,570
I mean, I've been in this
market so much,

00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,974
and I know how to get all
the things you talked about

00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:04,044
from the licensing
to the retail stores.

00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,746
I think you should be
everywhere and fast

00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:09,816
because you are something
that could really take off.

00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:11,017
Justine: Exactly.

00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,619
That's our mission.
We want to spread that joy

00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:14,087
and confidence
of learning something new.

00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:17,424
I'm gonna give you
$350,000 for 10%.

00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:18,958
Cuban: No!

00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:23,363
$300,000 for 8%.

00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:24,631
O'Leary: Okay, and --
It's 8%.

00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:27,200
This mentoring
is gonna be worth it.

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,135
Guys, you understand
all the offers, right?

00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,904
You got to make a decision.

00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,273
Hold it a second.
Just hold it a second.

00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:37,343
â™ªâ™ª

00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,720
Narrator:
All Sharks are still in.

00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,823
And there's a bidding war
between Barbara,

00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:53,293
Kevin, and Lori for Adrian
and Justine's highly profitable

00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:55,628
crochet kit business,
The Woobles.

00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:59,699
I'm gonna give you
the $350,000 for 5%.

00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,935
That's how much I believe
in your business.

00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,570
You are sitting
on a rocket,

00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,938
but you have to let me know
right away

00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,574
'cause I'm being a fool here
bidding against myself.

00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,742
Would you consider adding
another Shark to your offer?

00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:11,878
I'll do it with Mark.
Come on, Mark. Come in with me.
Yeah.

00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:14,481
I was $300,000 for 8%.
You don't need --

00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:16,249
I can do this all alone.

00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:18,451
We've read your book,
and we know --

00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,386
we've seen what you've
been able to do.

00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:23,990
I think that if you would
team up with another Shark...

00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:26,126
What was the amount
you gave out?

00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,628
$350,000.
The $350,000 for 6%.

00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,364
Robert, are you gonna
do anything here?

00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,666
Well, I'm trying to get
a word in here.

00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,835
[ Laughter ]
I mean, it's hard.

00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:38,438
I'm just seeing, how
can I get a piece of this?

00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:40,373
Do you want Robert in it?
Make an offer.
Make an offer.

00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:41,941
Justine: Yes.

00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:43,743
Oh.
I'd love to be involved.

00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:47,814
So we're gonna give you
$450,000 for 6%.

00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,349
The two of us together.
Cuban: There we go.
There's the answer.

00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:50,483
That's a nasty move.

00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,584
The two of us together.

00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,553
Guys, you understand
all the offers, right?

00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:54,787
You got to make
a decision.

00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:55,855
Adrian:
Can we take a moment?

00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:57,991
You can, you can.
Yes, yes.

00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,893
What do you think?

00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:03,363
[ Whispering
indistinctly ]

00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:05,165
I'm not sure.

00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,500
Let's just --
Let's just try.

00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,371
Okay, so...

00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:14,007
each Shark offers
a lot of different value

00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:17,076
in different areas, and where
we think in the short term

00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,711
that we can really get
the most help

00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,346
is with Mark and Lori.

00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:24,584
I feel offended.
And with Barbara --

00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:26,386
But I want to let
you know that, like,

00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:28,755
you mean so much to me, but --
but for the company, I think --

00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,256
Oh, how sweet.

00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:31,658
Lori, do you want
to work together?
But let me tell you --

00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:33,226
Wait, you're gonna
abandon me like that?

00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:35,061
Yes, it's over.
That's what they want to do.

00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,030
$450,000, 6%?

00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,565
You guys got a deal.

00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,134
Oh, I've had it now!

00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:42,569
Done? Yes?

00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:44,737
Herjavec: Wow.
Deal. We'd love to work
with you guys.

00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:45,772
Congratulations.

00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:46,873
Adrian: Thank you.
Justine: Thank you.

00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,608
Oh, my God, you guys,
it's so good.

00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,343
You guys are great.
Thank you so much.

00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:52,912
My God, he threw me
under the bus!

00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,480
You guys are as sharky
as we are. Congrats.

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,316
Greiner: Yeah, yeah.
Oh, they're very sharky.

00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:57,784
Greiner:
Good job, you guys.

00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,686
Are we skipping?
Sure, yeah.

00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:01,454
Skip out. [ Laughs ]

00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:03,256
Mark and Lori
were our target Sharks.

00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:06,125
We did not prepare for
that scenario at all,

00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,860
and we're just glad
it worked out.

00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,764
It was definitely a risky move
to try to break up

00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:14,434
Barbara and Mark and get Lori
in there instead.

00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:16,236
And we're glad
that it worked out.

00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,104
Mark, I brought you
into the deal.

00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,607
You didn't even want the deal.
I was pushing you for the deal.

00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,141
You were my partner.

00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:23,543
I never for a moment
thought you would

00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,345
throw me under the bus
and go with Lori.

00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:27,180
I really feel like
the scorned woman.
Herjavec:
See, I -- Barbara.

00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,481
Robert knew.

00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:29,649
Barbara,
that's the difference.

00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:31,751
I knew Lori would
throw me under the bus.

00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,653
[ Laughter ]

00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:38,424
Narrator: In Season 6, we
watched Brad, Aimy, and Justin

00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,728
make a deal with Mark Cuban
for their wine-based party punch

00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:43,129
BeatBox Beverages.

00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,864
Brad: BeatBox is
a party in a box.

00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:47,433
It's almost seven bottles of
wine packed into every box.

00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,802
Narrator: Let's see what
they're up to now.

00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:53,573
When we went on "Shark Tank",
we were doing about $235,000

00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:56,476
in sales with our 5-liter
bag-in-box party punch.

00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:57,644
In the first year
after "Shark Tank",

00:12:57,644 --> 00:13:00,380
our sales grew
to $750,000.

00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,582
Then over the next two years,
sales kind of flatlined.

00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:05,952
We launched in almost 400
Walmarts, and, uh, we failed.

00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,288
It didn't work.
We couldn't sell it through.

00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,357
The 5-liter bag-in-box
was a huge serving size,

00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:14,861
and to ask consumers
to spend $20 is a big challenge.

00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:18,097
That's when we decided to create
the single-serve Tetra Pak.

00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:20,166
By doing the single-serve,
we lowered the price point

00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,135
to under $5,
and when we did that,

00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,270
our sales doubled
from $1 million to $2 million.

00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,139
In 2019, they doubled again
to $4 million.

00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:30,677
Since "Shark Tank", we've done
over $57 million in sales.

00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:32,178
Whoa!

00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:34,180
Justin: The success
of single-serve really
saved the business.

00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,848
It allowed us to be
in a lot more stores

00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:38,084
where the bag-in-box
just couldn't be sold.

00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:40,320
Aimy: Our success has made it
so we were able to sponsor

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,788
tons of music festivals

00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:44,357
and have a great time
with our customers and BeatBox.

00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:47,393
Brad: We were in about
2,000 7-Elevens this year.

00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:49,529
We went from having
one distributor

00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:51,931
to now having
over 250 distributors

00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,800
across 48 states.

00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,368
It's absolutely
mind-blowing.

00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:58,438
People today don't buy products.
They don't buy brands.

00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,473
They buy part
of a community.

00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:02,875
Aimy, Brad and Justin
are great entrepreneurs

00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,011
because they're always looking
for new ways

00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,280
to create experiences
for their customers,

00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,748
and they have fun with it.

00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:11,617
It's just a really cool,
really fun brand

00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,219
that everybody can relate to.

00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:16,356

and changing the game.

00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:25,131
My advice to entrepreneurs
out there is that the road

00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:27,633
to success is certainly
not a straight line.

00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:30,503
The entrepreneurial roller
coaster is very, very real.

00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:32,271
You'll have some of
your best days ever

00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:33,573
and some of
your lowest days ever.

00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:35,108

about what you're bringing

00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:37,143

just don't give up.

We're seeking $250,000

00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,750
Sharks, there
are three well-known problems

00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,652
that need to be fixed
when it comes to

00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,487
the 9:00-to-5:00
work life.

00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,689
One, it's too boring.

push notifications,

00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,194

00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:31,798
establishing real human
connection is almost impossible.

and this one's universal...

a banana-shaped
Bluetooth handset

00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,710
that connects
to your smartphone.

00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,013
So you can talk to
your friends, family,

as a phone with appeal.

I worked for Visa,

Ah.
If it's six years old,

00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,591
hit us with a little sales.

00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:08,227
Sure, so we've done over
$1.6 million in lifetime sales.

00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:09,862

Yeah, but --

00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,531
$400,000 in net income.

last year?

Last year
was $540,000 in sales.

trying to blow off a colleague,
saying, "I'm really busy."

And after a quick
Instagram search,

00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:40,059
I realized that there were
45,000 other people

00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,527
who were making that joke
at the same time.

00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,796
Wow. Smart thinking.
And there's a Shark

that joke, as well.

that, Barbara?

But that's a very broad net --
Tell us what it costs

00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:53,139
if I want to buy it online and
what it costs you to land it.

00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:55,141
So this nanner
costs $39.99 retail.

00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:56,943
Oh!
That's a big banana!

00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:59,278
Our landed cost is
$6 a unit.

00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,546
Do you have a patent?

00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,548
We did not pursue
a design patent...

00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:03,916
What?
Shocking.

00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,885
...because they're notoriously
easy to copy and to knock off.

00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:08,054
So we pursued a trademark
to protect our brand.

00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:10,623
But, Max, just to be clear,
it's not a phone.

00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:12,792
You need to pair it
with a phone.
Brunsing: That's correct.

00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:14,427

your banana to your Apple.

Oh, thank you, Robert.
Herjavec: Got it, got it.

00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:19,765
Guys, let me ask you this.
You did $540,000 last year.

00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:23,869
Your total lifetime sales over
six years were $1.2 million.

00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:26,906
What shifted to get
your sales to go boom?

00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:29,375
In the last two years,
we've shifted to a robust

00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,744
direct-to-consumer
advertising strategy,

00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:35,181
leveraging Facebook,
Instagram, TikTok, Google.

00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:36,515
It sounds
very expensive.

00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:38,150
How much are you
spending on that?

00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,152
We're spending
$9 per customer.

00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:41,821
Is that your customer
acquisition, is 9 bucks?

00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:43,322
That's actually
not that bad.

00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,658
And what we are seeing
is that we hit people

00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:49,095
with targeted advertising
for high impulse conversions,

00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:50,663
and then when they
get the phone,

00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:53,265
there's a virality to it because
they're posting on social media.

00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:54,934
But nobody's full time
on this business.

00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,135
Right.
Correct. Not right now.

00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,336
Are you willing
to give up your careers

00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:58,971
to support the banana?
That's the question.

00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:02,108
If we have a strategic partner
who's willing to work

00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:04,076
with us and leverage it,
absolutely.

00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,612
Tell me what you're gonna
do with the $250,000.

00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:12,985

Guys, you know,
I think what you're trying to do

00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,860
in retail is beyond insane.

00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,395

This is not a product for me.
I'm out.

You guys took a fruit and turned
it into money in your pocket.

00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:38,377
Giving you $250,000 means
you've got to make $2.5 million

00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:40,579
in profits for me
just to get my money back.

00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:43,082
It's a great personal business,
but it's not a great fit for me.

00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:44,350

I'm out.

but nobody ever puts it in play.

"I'm in the banana phone
business,"

00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:58,497

00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,441
that much because I think
that they have

00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:11,744
a spike and then a fall.

00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:14,246
It's not really
the right product for me.

00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,048
So I'm sorry. I'm out.

00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,819
You know, I just object
to investing in your business

00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,253
for one reason only,

00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:24,657
which is I don't want you
working on this part time.

00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:26,826

doesn't equal three.

00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:27,927
Yeah.
All right?

00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:30,596

if you do that.

00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,622
Hello, Sharks.
I'm Brian.

00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,690
And I'm Kirk.
And we're here from the home

00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,794
of the Pro Football
Hall of Fame -- Canton, Ohio.

00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:39,598
We're here seeking $100,000
for a 10% stake in our company.

00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:42,368
Sharks, have you ever cooked
a chicken that was so dry

00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:43,736
it was barely edible?

00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:45,704
Or served a turkey at
Thanksgiving

00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:48,641
that was so parched your guests
wanted to offer it a drink?

00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,975
Well, that's
why we created...

00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,544
the Turbo Trusser!
The Turbo Trusser!

00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:54,680
The Turbo Trusser is
a rapid trussing device

00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,183
used when cooking
whole chickens and turkeys.

00:21:57,183 --> 00:22:01,821
Trussing is
a technique that...

00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,724
Trussing is
a technique that...

00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:08,093
Keeps the wings
and legs close to the body.
...keeps the wings
and legs close to the body.

00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:09,962
It cooks a bird
more evenly.

00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:11,130
Good save.

00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,365
Traditionally, this is done
with butcher's twine,

00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:16,035
which is messy
and hard to work with.

00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:17,436
And this is
for the birds.

00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:18,771
[ Chicken clucks ]

00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:20,639
But with the Turbo Trusser,
keeping your dinner

00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,374
nice and juicy
is a breeze.

00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:24,844
Just hook the Turbo Trusser
right into place.

00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,613
Closing up the cavity
and sealing all the juices

00:22:27,613 --> 00:22:30,249
to cook a perfect bird.

00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:32,084
Check out these
incredible results.

00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,152
Herjavec: Ooh!

00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:35,888
Sharks, you'll get
a delicious, juicy

00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:38,390
chicken or turkey
every time.

00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,626
And this product
is so universal,

00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:43,863
you can use it in ovens,
grills, smokers,

00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,131
roasters, rotisseries,
deep fryers,

00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:47,466
and heck,
even air fryers.

00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,602
And best of all, it's made
of food-grade stainless steel,

00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:50,836
and it's dishwasher safe.

00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:53,505
And it's made right here
in the good old USA.

00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:56,375
So which one of you Sharks
wants to take a bite

00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,910
out of the poultry
industry...

00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,512
Together: And make
a cluck load of money?

00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:01,981
So each one of you Sharks
on your table,

00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:03,616
you have samples
of our two versions.

00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:06,819
One's a chicken Turbo Trusser,
and one is made for turkeys.

00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:09,154
And then you also have
some chicken that was cooked

00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:10,723
with the Turbo Trusser
today.

00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,191
Kevin, we'd love
to have you come up.

00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:13,459
Go ahead and try it out.
I would love to.

00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:14,660
We've got a chef hat.

00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,562
You know, I am Chef Wonderful.
That's right.

00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,130
This is really good.
And of course,
we've got the apron.

00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,665
It is very good.

00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:21,267
[ Laughs ]

00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:22,701
That's good.

00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,770
Okay, you just pick
the Turbo Trusser up.

00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,872
Yeah.
And set it in the butt there.

00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,607
Okay. You set it
in the butt?

00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:30,542
Set it in the butt.
Okay, the butt cavity.

00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:31,777
And then lift the one leg up.
Oh, there we go.

00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,445
Lift one leg up
and put it in.

00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,047
Life the other leg up.
It's just that easy.

00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:36,415
It's just that easy.
Good.

00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,650
And then the other side,
do the same.

00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,752
What is the chicken community
saying about

00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:40,886
this torture device?

00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,388
They really like it.
[ Laughs ]

00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:45,157
We've sold about
11,000 units and had one return.

00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:46,659
Wow.
Wow.

00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:47,593
Very nice.

00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:48,761
Brian:
People really love it.

00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:50,195
You don't have to get
your hands all messy

00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:51,563
when you're using
butcher's twine.

00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:54,066
How much of this delicious
juiciness is because of this

00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:55,601
or the way you cooked it
in that particular oven?

00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,269
It's because of
the Turbo Trusser.

00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,470
That's what trussing
does it.

00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,872
It cooks it
so you're cooking

00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:01,607
one piece of meat
instead of five.

00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,709
So it's gonna
cook more evenly.

00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:05,511
I don't cook,
so I'm learning so much.

00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:07,479
Does everybody do this?

00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:08,981
You know what?
I think a lot of people do.

00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:11,784
But I think people are,
one, afraid to do it with twine

00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,419
'cause it's --
it's intimidating

00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:14,820
if you don't
know how to do it.
Oh, yeah, like, if you told me

00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,423
to tie up a dead chicken,
I'd be, like...

00:24:17,423 --> 00:24:20,326
Normally got to go online,
watch a 5- or 10-minute video.

00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:21,760
So, guys,
how did you get here?

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,996
You know, how did you get
in chicken suits

00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:26,699
on "Shark Tank", on the carpet?
Yeah, tell us your story.

00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:28,801
For the last 18 years,
I've been working

00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,102
in the pharmaceutical
industry.

00:24:30,102 --> 00:24:31,136
I've worked for three of
the largest

00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,571
pharmaceutical companies
in the world.

00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:35,341
But Kirk and I, we met about
five or six years ago.

00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:36,542
He was renovating
my house.

00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:39,178
I was a contractor
for 20 years.

00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:41,814
I went to culinary school
back in the early '90s.

00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:45,217
I was a sous chef in a -- in a
couple big banquet kitchens

00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,419
and country clubs,
but I got burnt out,

00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:49,188
and that's how I got
into contracting.

00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:51,490
As a contractor,
I found a problem

00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,725
with straight
shut-off valves.

00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:55,761
I invented a wrench
that has over 800 positions,

00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:57,396
and I have
two utility patents

00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:59,465
and I think five
design patents on it.

00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:01,066
And I ended up
licensing it.

00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:03,202
And then Brian's like, "I want
to start inventing, too.

00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:04,770
This is really cool."
And I'm like,

00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,071
"Okay, well, let's do it."
Yeah, it was that easy, right?

00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:08,107
We're gonna invent our way
into chicken suits.

00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:09,375
Right.

00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:12,044
We've invented personally
together six products,

00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:14,413
four in the barbecue industry,
two in the pet industry.

00:25:14,413 --> 00:25:15,614
And then he's got
a wrench.

00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:17,816
Before this product,
did you make any money?

00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:19,451
Not a dime.
No.

00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:20,519
[ Laughter ]
Not a dime.

00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,388
But you know what?
We kept inventing.

00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:24,256
O'Leary: Let's get back to this
product for a second.

00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:25,924
How much does it cost?

00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:28,994
How much do you make it for?
How many have you sold?

00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:31,930
So right now, it costs --
well, on our last order,

00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:35,968
it was $3.07 to make,
MSRP is $14.99.

00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:37,636
And how many have you
sold in dollars?

00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:39,238
$90,000 in sales.

00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:41,273
So we've been in business
for eight and a half months.

00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:44,510
60% of our sales
come from our website alone.

00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:47,179
27% of our sales
go through distributors.

00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:49,848
We have three distributors.
We're in 75 stores now.

00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:52,051
Oh, you are? And how is it
selling? Is it selling through?
Yep.

00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,385
Yep. Selling through.

00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,887
All three of our
distributors have reordered.

00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:56,722
We have somebody that's selling
on Amazon for us now.

00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,057
He's reordered
three times.

00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:00,459
Herjavec: Uh, Brian, I love you
guys. I love this thing.

00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:05,531
I know nothing about it.
It's just not big enough for me.

00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:06,698
Don't chicken out.

00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:07,800

00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,334

O'Leary: He's a turkey.

00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:14,440
Well done.

00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,775
Brian, Kirk, I love it.
Not for me.

00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,077
Thank you. Thank you, Robert.
Thank you for your time.

00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:19,511
Appreciate it.
Brian, how would I make money

00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:20,813
on a deal like this?

00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:22,981
It seems like a little business,
a little bit of sales.

00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:26,118
Doesn't seem like there's room
for a third person by any means.

00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:27,453
Barbara,
that's a great question.

00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:29,021
87 million turkeys
are consumed

00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:30,222
just between
the three holidays

00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:32,291
of Thanksgiving,
Easter, and Christmas.

00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:34,426
We're not online
marketing experts, right?

00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,961
So we're
looking for somebody

00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:37,696
that can help us
with some marketing,

00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,364
get us some
social media exposure.

00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:42,434
But, guys, look, it's hard
to connect your product

00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,570
to all those turkeys
and chickens.

00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:47,005
I-I just don't see you
being able to scale,

00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,941
which makes it really
difficult as an investor.

00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,909
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:52,344
Thank you very much
for your time.
Thank you, Mark.

00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:55,047
So it's not
really investable for me.

00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:58,417
It's not big enough, and I
really hate touching chicken.

00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:00,986
So I just have to be honest
about that.

00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:04,056
[ Laughs ]
And for those reasons, I am out.

00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:05,424
But I think you'll do
really well.

We appreciate that feedback.
Thank you.

00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,461
Brian, it's not
a big enough business for

00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,897
an investor to make money.

00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:13,232
I'm out.

00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:16,668
Brian, you've got -- you've got
one turkey left.

00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:19,671
O'Leary:
You know, guys, I look at this,

00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:22,875
and I see the potential of it,
but there's so much work.

00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:25,010
We don't want you guys to do
the work for us.

00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,345
We're gonna do the work.

00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:28,046
Listen, we're here.
We won't let you down.

00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:29,148
We just need
your connections.

00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:30,716
I mean, imagine if
Chef Wonderful

00:27:30,716 --> 00:27:32,184
took this under his wing.

00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:33,852
We would love to have
you under the wing.

00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:35,154
Would love that.
But he ain't free.

00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:36,588
He's an expensive chef.

00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:39,057
I mean, I wish you'd had a model
already put out there

00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:41,860
where I just had
to pour gasoline on it.

00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,695
They do. They have
a product here you can sell.

00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:46,965
So I have to don my whites.
I have to be Chef Wonderful.

00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:49,868
I have to sell a lot of these
to make any money.

00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:51,737
Um...

We're flexible
in our equity.

We're here
to make a deal.
Yep.

00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:58,477
Yes, I know that.

00:27:58,477 --> 00:27:59,845

this is a royalty deal.

I-I can't believe you're not
mentioning that.

00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,915

00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:11,323
The only way I would do this --
I'll give you the $100,000.

00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:14,893
I want 33%,
but wait, there's more.

00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,929

that offer.

00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:26,872
Would you do that deal
for 20% and the $1 royalty?

00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:27,973
No, no.

something I can really

00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:35,914
get to town on, but I've got to
make it worth my while.

00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:38,350

That's very reasonable, I think,
given the amount of work --

this, guys,

00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:02,708

Hi, Sharks.
My name is Braxton Fleming,

00:30:56,922 --> 00:30:58,990
and I'm from
Mays Landing, New Jersey.

00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,226
And I'm seeking $200,000

00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:05,063
in exchange for 15% equity
of my company.

00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:09,601
Six years ago, the trajectory
of my whole life changed.

00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:13,105
I realized...
I was transgender.

00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:15,640
With this realization
came with a lifelong commitment

00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,642
of taking
hormone replacement therapy

00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:19,644
in the form of injections.

00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:21,580
During my first year
of transitioning,

00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,382
there was nowhere
to properly store

00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:29,121
my medical needs in a safe,
neat, discreet, yet stylish way.

00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:32,224
That's where Stealth Bros &amp; Co.
revolutionized the way

00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:35,327
that we store our meds
and dispose of our sharps.

00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:38,797
This was born out of my own need
as a trans man,

00:31:38,797 --> 00:31:42,634
but I realized there were
multiple underrepresented

00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:45,737

who needed this product.

Who do you know
that's a diabetic?

00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:50,075
Or maybe you know someone going
through infertility treatment,

00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:54,045

or even cisgendered individuals

00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:56,381
going through hormone
replacement therapy.

00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:59,651
All of these underrepresented
medical communities

00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:03,021
need options to travel

So we can have a look

00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:32,517
at this here?
Absolutely.

00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:35,187
Please open up your bags and
take a look at what you have.

00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:36,955
Herjavec: What do we
have in front of us, Braxton?

00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,290
Okay, so what you have
in front of you

00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:42,828
is a junior Dopp kit and
a stealth sharp shuttle inside.

00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:46,298
So the junior Dopp kit
that you have is

00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:48,233
our foundational
junior Dopp kit,

00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:51,203
which is in line
with our sword interior.

00:32:51,203 --> 00:32:53,705
And then, Lori,
you have our premium Dopp kit,

00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:56,007
which is made
with our vegan faux leather.

00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:58,243
So your medicines
and everything can go in here?

00:32:58,243 --> 00:32:59,344
The vials?

00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:01,880
Yes, that is
for the vials.

00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,181
What's a sharp?

00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:06,451
So a sharps is part of
your injectable needs.

00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:07,986
It's a needle?

00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,387
It's a biohazard container.
Absolutely.

00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:10,655
To put your needle it.
Absolutely.

00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,390
Well, after I use the needle,
I put it in here?

00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:15,861
Yes. So you just pop this top
open like this.

00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:17,662
And then it can close.

00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,832
And you can open it
and close it multiple times.

00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,501
Once it's filled,

00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:25,337
then you want to take
that little latch at the top,

00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:28,673
stick it in that compartment,
and then it locks permanently,

00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,775
and then you can
discard it appropriately.

00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:33,812
So this is the disposable
aspect of the needles.

00:33:33,812 --> 00:33:36,515
Yes.
But does only one
come with your kit?

00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,650
I would think you'd be
using these like crazy.

00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:42,220
So, yes, we actually
offer them in bundles.

00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,790
So you could buy it for one,
three, or five on my website.

00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,592

from a large retailer,

and they will be sold
in a bundle pack of four.

'Cause I've seen
plenty of them.

00:33:56,935 --> 00:33:58,403
Yes.
And so you just

00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,405
made them more fashionable
and more fashion looking?

00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:02,574
Correct.
And same with the sharps.

00:34:02,574 --> 00:34:04,009
Absolutely.
Okay.

00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:06,077
What was missing
from the other kits?

00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:07,546
And is it
what Mark said?

00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:10,148
Right, right.
You just made it
more fashionable and cool?

00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:14,286
What was missing was
the effect that it was daunting

00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:16,454
to take the injection
for me.

00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:18,423
Even though I'm a nurse,
I've been a nurse

00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:20,225
for the past 11 years,

00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:23,528
I realized that, yes,
I give injections every day,

00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:25,864
but when I was watching
the YouTube videos online

00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:27,632
of my community
taking these injections,

00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:30,969
I was realizing how much anxiety
was bri-- it was bringing them.

00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:32,137
Sure.

00:34:32,137 --> 00:34:34,072
And once I created something
that organized

00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,675
everything for them,
they weren't all over the place.

00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:38,743
I want to bring an experience
to the user.

00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,645
I want them to feel good
about themselves.

00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:43,548
And this brings happiness
to my community,

00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:45,216
and that's what
I'm trying to do here.

00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:47,819
How do you reach your community?
How do you sell the product?

00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:50,255
So I sell the product
all through e-commerce,

00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:53,592
and I've just been growing
organically through influencer.

00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,360
And now would be
a good time to ask you,

00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,628
how much
have you sold?

00:34:56,628 --> 00:34:59,931
Year to date, currently,
we're at $110,000.

00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,232
That's good.
Herjavec: And last year,

00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:02,033
what did you do,
Braxton?

00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:04,135
We did $147,000.

00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:06,371
So we're up 40%
currently right now.

00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:08,773
What does this cost to make,
and what do you sell it for?

00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:12,877
Okay, so the one that you have
costs $5.80 for me,

00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:16,047
and then I sell it
for $34.

00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:17,115
$34?

00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,516
Greiner:
That's a big margin.

00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,819
On the sharp stuff, what
your cost is for one of these?

00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:22,921
Fleming: Okay.
And what you're gonna sell

00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:24,589
the one, three, and four pack,
I guess.

00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:29,861
Okay, so if we buy over
10,000 pieces of that,

00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:31,630
it's at 28 cents,

00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:35,200
and then we sell them
for $4 on the website.

00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,435
And then if you buy
a pack of five, it's $15.

00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:39,137
And what are you gonna
sell it for wholesale

00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,238
to the retailer?

00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:42,340
So I sell it
to them for $7.50,

00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,676
and then they're reselling it
for $14.99.

00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:48,179
So $7.50 for a pack of four.
And it cost you 28 cents?

00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:49,414
Yes. Thank you.

00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:50,949
Herjavec: Mark's gonna
start selling them.

00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:52,450
Braxton, can you tell us
a little bit about

00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,519
yourself
and your background?

00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:55,854
Absolutely. Absolutely.

00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:58,890
So I actually come from
two entrepreneurial parents,

00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,259
and as I was growing up,

00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:04,229
I was very accepted
in my family.

00:36:04,229 --> 00:36:06,331
You know, my parents loved me.
They never judged me.

00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:08,166
They let me be
whoever I wanted to be.

00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,368
And at the age of
27 years old, I said,

00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,437
"Something is missing
from my life."

00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:15,006
And that's when I realized
that I was transgender.

00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:18,877
And once I made that change,
as I was watching

00:36:18,877 --> 00:36:21,479
YouTube videos of other
trans men taking

00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:24,049
hormone replacement injections,
that's how I realized

00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:25,650
that there was
a need for this.

00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,820
And I was indirectly
assessing them

00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,889
with my nursing skills, saying,
"Oh, that's not safe."

00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:32,290
Like, they're putting it
in shoe boxes,

00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,025
they're putting it
in plastic bags.

00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,161
And that's when I said,
"You know, I really want

00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:39,864
to become a part of my community
because they've given me so much

00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,766
that I wanted to give back."

00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:44,669
I created this brand,
and it just blew up.

00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:46,471
Is it just you
running the business?

00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:47,839
It's all me.
I do everything.

00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,041
I literally work out
of my basement right now.

00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,810
I have all my product
down there.

00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,112
Are you still doing this
completely out of your basement?

00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:55,246
Yes. 100%.

00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,015
And are you nursing
still, or...?

00:36:57,015 --> 00:36:59,484
Yes, I've actually been trying
to slow down

00:36:59,484 --> 00:37:01,753
because I've been putting
more effort into the business.

00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:03,788
I'm just curious,
the logo,

00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:05,356
Stealth Bros and Co.

00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:06,858
Yes.
When you came out here,

00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:08,093
I thought --
Cuban: It's a great name now.

00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:10,662
Now that we know
and understand it, it's great.

00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:12,263
I'll explain the name.

00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:14,866
Stealth is because
I wanted people to be able

00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:16,601
to keep their
medication discreet.

00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:17,635
No, I get
the stealth part.

00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:19,404
Why the Bros and Co.
and the swords?

00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:21,306
And Bros is, we're built
on the foundation

00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:23,842
of the brotherhood of F-to-M --
female to male brotherhood.

00:37:23,842 --> 00:37:25,110
I see.

00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,979
And then "&amp; Co."
is &amp; communities

00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:29,814
that we keep,
our allied communities.

00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:31,449
That's great.
And then the swords

00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:34,152
are there for because
iron sharpens iron,

00:37:34,152 --> 00:37:36,488
and more than one community
coming together

00:37:36,488 --> 00:37:38,323
makes you better and stronger,
and that what --

00:37:38,323 --> 00:37:40,458
Do you have that up on your
website, the explanation?

00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,060
I actually do not.

00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,394
You should. It's cool.
I should. Thank you.

00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:44,529
You should.
That's very cool.

00:37:44,529 --> 00:37:45,730
And there should be
a video there

00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,932
of you explaining it
because the power

00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,400
of how you
just explained it...

00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,535
Yes.
Yeah.

00:37:50,535 --> 00:37:52,537
...that comes across
very, very well.

00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:53,705
Thank you.

00:37:53,705 --> 00:37:56,908
I think that it's kind of
the -- the perfect kit,

00:37:56,908 --> 00:37:59,077
and I love what you're doing
for the community.

00:37:59,077 --> 00:38:01,446
I don't think
you need a partner.

00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:03,915
I don't always say that.
I rarely say it.

00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:05,416
I think
you should run this.

00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,085
I think you should take
all the profit.

00:38:07,085 --> 00:38:09,220
And I think you should
grow step by step.

00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,755
And you're gonna have
a wonderful business

00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:12,290
and reap what you sow.

00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,994
And for those reasons, I wish
you good luck, but I'm out.

00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:17,962
Thank you, Lori.
I appreciate it.

00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,799
So, Braxton, the greatest
part of your business,

00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:22,700
not to diminish the other
parts of your business,

00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,868
is really you.
Thank you.

00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:27,005
I mean, you exude
an incredible warmth.

00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:28,139
Thank you.

00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,809
And personality
that draws people to you.

00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:31,843
Thank you.

00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:34,412
I think you've got
a good business.

00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:36,714
Just at the size
you are right now,

00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:38,349
just not something
for me.

00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:39,851
I'm out.
I wish you all the best.

00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:41,619
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,955
Corcoran: I've had some
personal experience.

00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:45,023
When I was trying
to get pregnant,

00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:46,891
I was doing in-vitro
for seven years

00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:48,660
to give birth to
my first born.
Wow.

00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,195
Thank God it worked.
Wow.

00:38:50,195 --> 00:38:51,462
God bless you.

00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:53,431
I remember being
in business meetings,

00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:54,833
in museums...
Yes.

00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:57,869
...in theaters where
it's time to take my big shot.

00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:59,437
Right.
It was just as big as this.

00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:00,939
Yeah.
With a big plunger.

00:39:00,939 --> 00:39:02,507
And it was made of oil
that burned when it went in.

00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:03,541
That's right.
It was horrible.

00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:04,609
Yeah.

00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:07,278
But the ingenious ways
I had to come up with

00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:08,913
just to hide that.

00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:10,081
Not that I was ashamed,

00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:11,449
but what do you do with
the damn needle?

00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:13,751
Right, right.
You know, my life had to go on.

00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:16,154
I used to carry
books with me,

00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:19,991
cut out pages in the middle,
cut a page, like a spot.

00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:20,959
Wow.
And carry the book

00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:22,093
and stick
the needles in there.

00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,795
Because you can't dispose
in a restroom.

00:39:23,795 --> 00:39:25,563
You can't throw it
in a garbage can.

00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:27,332
But let me
tell you something.

00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:30,201
You have genuine warmth
and love

00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,636
that your pitch
comes from.

00:39:31,636 --> 00:39:33,071
Thank you.
You feel it all over.

00:39:33,071 --> 00:39:34,172
And you know what?

00:39:34,172 --> 00:39:36,274
I'm a believer,
if you're that sincere...

00:39:36,274 --> 00:39:38,109
Yes.
...and you come from
that love spot...

00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:39,944
Yes.
...people always do well.

00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:42,814
And they buy. They just buy.
It's like a magic wand.

00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:45,016
And I think it's terrific
what you do.

00:39:45,016 --> 00:39:47,118
Thank you so much, Barbara.
Thank you.

00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:48,820
So I'm gonna
make you an offer.

00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,521
â™ªâ™ª

00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:02,100
â™ªâ™ª

00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,203
Narrator: Two Sharks are out,
and Barbara seems interested

00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:09,474
in Braxton's medical Dopp kit
company Stealth Bros &amp; Co.

00:40:09,474 --> 00:40:11,309
Corcoran: I think
it's terrific what you do.

00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:13,544
Thank you so much, Barbara.
Thank you.

00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:15,647
I'm gonna make you
an offer...
Okay.

00:40:15,647 --> 00:40:18,349
...of $200,000, but I don't want
to put in all cash.

00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:20,985
I'm gonna give you
$100,000 in a credit line,

00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:22,820
$100,000 cash.
Okay.

00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,056
And I do want 20%
of the business

00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:27,558
'cause I want to feel happy
when you do well and make money.

00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:30,261
So I'd like to be part
of that celebration with you.

00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,629
Yes.
Yeah.

00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:32,797
I-I think it has merit.

00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:34,866
I think you
have made something

00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:36,734
much more fashionable
and interesting to own.

00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:37,635
I get it.

00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:38,770
Barbara, do you want
any help?

00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:39,938
Or you want to
do it yourself?

00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,539
You want to jump in?
I think it's a good cause.

00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:42,740
Yeah, I'll split it with you
if you want.

00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,975
Yeah. Okay.

00:40:43,975 --> 00:40:45,343
I like the fact
you know your numbers.

00:40:45,343 --> 00:40:47,111
Right.
But it's not a product

00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,680
that's gonna fit for me.

00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,014
Okay.
But I wish you the best.

00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:51,749
You're a good guy.
The presentation was very good.

00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:53,117
Thank you, Kevin.

00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,486
I'm out, but you do have
an offer from a Sharkette.

00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:57,722
And Mark is still,
I believe.

00:40:57,722 --> 00:41:00,258
No, I'm -- I'm very interested,
and Barb and I were talking.

00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:01,526
From an operational
perspective,

00:41:01,526 --> 00:41:02,994
it's not just
a cash issue.

00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:04,662
It's building your
business issue, as well.

00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:05,663
Yes, it is.

00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:06,931
Because you're
doing it yourself,

00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:09,801
trying to scale it from
the basement to a business...

00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,469
Correct.
...is going to be
a lot of work,

00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,571
and I think between
our two organizations,

00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:16,074
we -- we can complement each
other to get you there.
Absolutely.

00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:19,043
And so if it works with you,
Barb and I will split it.

00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:23,948
So it's going to be $200,000,
$100,000 of that in cash,

00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:26,985
and $100,000 of that
as a line of credit for 20%.

00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:29,020
What do you think,
Braxton?

00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,155
Wow. That's amazing.

00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,490
What do you think?

00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,625
Um...

00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,029
It wouldn't be right
if I didn't counter.

00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:40,832
So, are you guys willing
to go to 18%?

00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:46,471
Well...

00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,408
You guys got a deal.

00:41:50,408 --> 00:41:52,110
-You got it.
-Oh, yes!

00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:54,712
Congratulations!
Thank you so much.

00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:56,347
It's such a pleasure, Mark.
Thank you so much.

00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,982
Congratulations.
Appreciate it.

00:41:57,982 --> 00:41:59,384
Thank you so much.
Barbara.

00:41:59,384 --> 00:42:01,085
My pleasure.

00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:02,854
Congrats.
Thank you so much, everybody.

00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:05,023
Cuban: Congrats.
Thank you.
This was a pleasure.

00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:07,091
Fleming: I'm so excited.

00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:09,093
I-I cannot believe that
I just secured a deal

00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:10,428
with Mark and Barbara.

00:42:10,428 --> 00:42:11,562
I'm just like...

00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:13,698
Oh, my God. I just...

00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:18,136
I prayed so hard for this.
