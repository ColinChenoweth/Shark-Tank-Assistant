to have done on this one.

for $500,000

That's crazy.

it's worth $5 million?

00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,653
Because you're
not making money.

00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:00,253
Not yet.

00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,256
Yeah, but you want us
to put our money today

00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,059
based on your potential
in the future.

00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,994
That's asking a lot.
We have no idea

00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,062

00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:10,297
Everybody's saying,
if you had come in

00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:15,835
asking for $50K, $80K, $100K,
we'd take a flier on you.

00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,103
I couldn't do that, though,

00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,206
because when we go into Walmart,
they're gonna want $350,000

00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,309

That's not our problem.

For us to get back
$500,000...
Yeah.

00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,185
...you have to generate
$5 million

00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,387

my money back?

So, all of us are very --
get pitched a lot.

00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:29,309
We can easily look
for game developers.

00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:31,945
As Kevin said,
there's thousands of them.

00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:33,980
And for $500,000,

00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,384
we can probably acquire
a 70% or 90% position

00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:39,352
on something that has not
been discovered.

00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,254
And that's the biggest
challenge for us.

00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,089

this is too rich for me.

00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,257

you're just asking us all --

00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:58,238

over and over again --

my presence online,

in front of you,

00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:16,823
you have some of
my signature items.

00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:20,593
Mark, you have our reversible
basketball shorts with pockets.

00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:23,730
I like that.
Ladies, we know that we have
to have pockets in all items.

00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,332
So if you turn that thing inside
out, it's a whole nother pair.

00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,101
I like it.
Thank you.

00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:28,634
Right here, we have our

00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:31,437
Winston-Salem
half-zip windbreaker.

00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,406
In front of you,
Mr. Wonderful,

00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:34,907
is our reversible
satin jacket.

00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:38,578
So if you unzip that, it's going
to turn to a whole nother side.

00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:40,413
Lori, you have our other
windbreaker.

00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:41,547
It's a full-zip.

00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,550
It gives you a blast
from the past, a '90s feel.

00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,387
And, Daymond, you also have
our reversible jacket

00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,489
from my alma mater,
Norfolk State University.

00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:50,490
Nice quality.

00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,258
How much does
it cost you to make,

00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:53,593
and how much
do you sell it for?

00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:55,428
The jacket that you have
right there,

00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:56,429
we get it for $28.

00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:58,564
We sell it on our site
for $110.

00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,600
We sell it to
the department store for $56.

00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,702
The reversible shorts
right there, we get for $20.

00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:05,138
We sell it to
the department store for $48.

00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:06,372
They sell it for $100.

00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,474
Our reversible jackets,
we pay $30 for that.

00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:09,709
We charge $165.

00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:12,745
How did you start to do this,
and what's your background?

00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,549
So, I designed from early
high school into college.

00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:17,750
It became a side hustle.

00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,686
I began designing for
every organization on campus,

00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,622
and I seen there
that nothing looked

00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:23,756
like the things
that I was designing.

00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,691
So I decided
to start my own brand.

00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,493
At the beginning,
I was doing Greek apparel,

00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:28,828
and then I decided
to make HBCU apparel

00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:31,731
because I seen that there was
a bigger need in that community.

00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:34,667
And how many HBCUs,
or, you know,

00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,602
historical Black colleges
and universities,

00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,471
how many of those exist?

00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:39,539
Depending on the person,

00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:41,607
some might say 100,
some might say 102.

00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,576
And you have 40 licenses
already in existence?

00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:44,710
Yes.
So that's great.

00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,546
You have almost
half of them, right?

00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:49,649
Yes. But the thing is,
I've gotten our license

00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:51,484
for everybody
that allows it.

00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:52,552
The other schools,
they don't have

00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:54,487
licensing programs
in place.

00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:56,456
They don't have
licensing programs in place?
Yes.

00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,391
That might be an opportunity
for you right there.

00:15:58,391 --> 00:15:59,425
Absolutely.

00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:00,626
So, very big.

00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,529
The number-one shoemaker
in the world

00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,498
has just invested,
I think,

00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:08,901
a couple billion
over 15 years to HBCUs.
Yes.

00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:12,805
So this is a very, very hot
and fast-growing area.

00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,575
I tell you, what gets me
hot to trot is sales.

00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,376
Yes.
What do you got?

00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:20,146
To date, we've made $3.3 million
since --

00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:20,813
-Whoo!
-Whoa!

00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,649
The total over
what period of time?
Since 2017.

00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,518
So what have you sold
the last 12 months?

00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:28,287
The last 12 months,
we're at $1.4 million.

00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:28,888
Wow.

00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:32,258
Can you walk me through
this calendar year's sales

00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:33,659
and potential profits?

00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,661
And how they break down,
online versus retail?

00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:40,433
Okay, this calendar year so far,
we've made about $1.1 million.

00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:44,270
That equals up,
I want to say, maybe 75%.

00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,738
The rest are e-commerce.

00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,673
We're currently in
Dick's Sporting Goods,

00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:51,444
Follett, which services 25
of the HBCU bookstores...
Wow.

00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:52,478
...and also on Fanatics.

00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:53,513
Literally two days ago,

00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,648
I got a purchase order
from Follett

00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:58,551
for $973,000
for our fall.

00:16:58,551 --> 00:16:59,619
-Wow.
-Wow.

00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:01,454
So...
Greiner: Good for you.

00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:02,655
How exciting.

00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:04,357
So, are you gonna
make money this year?
Yes, we are.

00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,358
What do you think
you'll make?

00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,559
To date, we revenue --

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,395
we have $343,000
that we made this year

00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:10,696
from the 1.1 --

00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,965
Okay. So you've profited
about 25% so far.
Yes.

00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:16,636
You've got a purchase order
for $973,000 coming in.
Yes, sir.

00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:18,538
Plus, you've got all your
other sales that are coming --

00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:19,805
And then, also, we have
more department stores.

00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,674
How are you
financing them?

00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:22,942
We have a really good
manufacturer.

00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:26,412
He allows for us to pay him
after we get our payment.
Wow.

00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:27,547
John: Now,
this is very creative,

00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:28,648
and this is what,
in our business,

00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:31,484
we call the factories
holding the paper.

00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:32,618
Yes.
That's what we called it,
right,

00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,020
and a lot of people
can learn from this.

00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,956
So you were able to scale
because he's doing that.

00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:39,058
So, what would the money
be used for, then?

00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,794
The money would be used for --
we're actually in-house.

00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,095
We have a five-person team.

00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,565
So once they get here,
we have to tag them, all that.

00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:46,866
I want to go into fulfillment

00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:49,635
and having a 3PL company tag it,

00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:50,770
getting it ready
for department stores

00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:51,904
to make sure that that's right.

00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,374
Well, you don't have to pay
for a 3PL per se.

00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:56,842
You find a good 3PL,

00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:58,778
and then you send them
the inventory,

00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:01,781
and then you only pay
as they pick and pack.
Ship them out.

00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:03,683
Yes. We would also use it
for marketing.

00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:06,619
We've only spent $50,000
in marketing.

00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,521
But do you need to spend
anything on marketing?

00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:09,689
I honestly believe
that we do,

00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:10,856
because all the stores
that we're in,

00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:11,857
we're not even --
we don't have, like,

00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:13,826
a key place in the store.

00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,494
We actually wanted,
those other schools

00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:16,662
that we don't have
licensing for,

00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:17,997
convincing them,
"Hey, choose us."

00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:19,732
Yeah, marketing
won't change their mind.

00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:21,534
The sell-through will.
Okay, yeah.

00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:22,735
Are you running this
yourself?

00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:24,604
Yes, I'm head designer.

00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:25,972
I'm talking to
the manufacturers.

00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:27,873
This is your baby and
you're running it day to day,

00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,609
or is there
a separate CEO?

00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:30,876
No, I'm day to day.
You're everything, right?

00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,778
[ Laughs ]
Every hat, every hat.

00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,747
Ashley, I have to
ask you this.

00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:37,483
I mean, your enthusiasm,
your confidence is...

00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:38,484
It's amazing.
...huge...

00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:39,752
Thank you.
...and amazing.

00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:41,854
Can you please tell us
a bit more about your story?

00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:42,922
Like, where did this
come from?

00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:44,857
My grandparents had
one of the first

00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:47,893
African-American beauty supply
companies in our area,

00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:50,563
so I've seen
entrepreneurship firsthand.

00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:51,931
And then,
when I turned 13,

00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:54,567
my mom worked for
the Ford Company subsidiary,

00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:55,668
they left Norfolk, Virginia.

00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:56,969
So I went into hustle mode,

00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,904
and it was like,
"I could at least pay for me

00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,774
to go pay for lunch for myself,
I can pay to get my hair done."

00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:04,677
So it just became second nature,
to be honest.

00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:05,878
You had to take care
of you.

00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,581
Yes, yes. And it wasn't --
my mom never asked this,

00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:09,649
I just wanted to help.

00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,417
Like, "I know I can do this
for myself,"

00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:11,884
like, "I can handle this.

00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,019
You don't worry
about that, Mom."

00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:15,588
You're hot stuff --
You're killing it, Ashley.

00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:16,722
My God.
Ashley, you've gotta be

00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:18,424
putting money
in your pocket right now.

00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:18,958
Not yet.

00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,126
You're investing in inventory
continuously?

00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:21,794
Everything is going right back
into the business.

00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:23,029
You're not
making a salary?

00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:24,664
You don't pay yourself
anything?

00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:25,998
I pay myself
next to nothing.

00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,601
I'm still trying to get --
How are you surviving?

00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:29,835
I have a great community.

00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,871
My family, my mom,
she believes in me.

00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:34,507
That is really
mind-blowing.

00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,609
Problem for me --

00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:38,644
I don't know much at all
about this area.

00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:41,047
I am not really
and never have really been

00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:45,618
much in the apparel world,
nor in the sports...

00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:46,619
I understand.

00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:47,787
Greiner:
It's not really my thing.

00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:49,021
And so,
for that reason,

00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,490
I wish you good luck,
but I'm out.

00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,692
I appreciate it.
Thank you.

00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:55,061
You are on fire.
Thank you.

00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:57,697
But this isn't a business
I know a thing about.

00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,865
Sadly, I'm out.

00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,935
Ashley, I look at it
as a inventory challenge,

00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,603
because
the bigger you get,

00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:05,771
the more capital
you're gonna need

00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,206
to hold all these
different SKUs,

00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:11,744
and more licenses, more SKUs,
more inventory, more capital.

00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:14,013
That's what I've learned about
the clothing business.

00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:15,648
It's not a business
I want to be in.

00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:17,850
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Thank you.

00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:21,687
The challenge I have
is I'm in this area
in certain aspects.

00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:25,858
I either advise or own
companies in this area,

00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:27,993
Eastman Golf
and Actively Black, FUBU,

00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:31,263
and then another company
you may know of, AACA,

00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:32,965
African-American Colleges --
Okay, yes, yes, I'm familiar.

00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:37,103
So it would be challenging
for me to split hairs like this,

00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:40,639
and I don't think I would be
giving you -- doing a service.

00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:41,874
But I will
give you one idea.

00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:44,043
Instead of having -- trying to
go to a lot of retailers,

00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:46,846
we've had one
representative young man

00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:49,949
and one representative
young woman at each school

00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:51,951
who are the official sellers
of the goods,

00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:54,687
and they get maybe $1,000,
$2,000 worth of product,

00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:55,721
and sell it
however they want,

00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:56,822
and they've been doing it
like that.

00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:58,023
I would highly suggest
you do that.

00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,126
But at this moment,
it's a conflict for me.

00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:01,994

So, she has
a very bulky sweater

00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,016
that looks like
it's tucked into her jeans

to her waistband.

Why do I need it
with this outfit?

00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:57,029
Well, for example, if I were
to tuck this top into my skirt,

00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:59,164
it would add more bulk
to my waistband,

00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,200
which is exactly
what I don't want to happen

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,103
when I'm trying to make the most
of the figure that I have,

00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:07,072
which does lead me
to why I created Tucky.

00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,375
Okay. Yes.
Tell us your story.

00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:12,411
So, I created Tucky
after I'd had my second child.

00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:16,081
I was recently postpartum,
which meant that I felt a little

00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:19,184
disconnected from the body
that I was living with.

00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,387
In order to feel
back in touch with my body,

00:25:21,387 --> 00:25:24,356
I was wearing sweatpants
and sweatshirts, matching sets,

00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,358
but there's a lot of bulk
in those sets.

00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,294
So I was tucking my top up
into my bra,

00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:31,397
hiking my sweatpants up high,

00:25:31,397 --> 00:25:34,266
and essentially creating
an hourglass figure

00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,135
when I really didn't have one
again yet.

00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:38,971
The problem was, I was playing
with my then-2-year-old

00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:41,006
and my newborn on the floor,

00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:42,274
picking them up,
playing with them.

00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:44,376
My top would just slip
right back out.

00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,211
So when I went online
to look for a product

00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:49,381
that might solve this issue,
nothing existed yet.

00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,517
And that's when I thought,
"If it's a problem for me,

00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:55,020
it's probably a problem
for millions of other women."

00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,288
And that's how
Tucky was born.

00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:58,957

00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:51,043
It was a very popular hack
on social media at the time.

it's a clever idea.

00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:13,565

how big the market is for it.

a great little business for you

00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:18,437
and I think you will do well,

00:27:18,437 --> 00:27:22,141

but I'm out.

00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:28,447
to address a few things that
you just mentioned.

00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:31,216
So, Tucky's primary market
is between the ages

00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:34,052
of 17 and 25 years old.

00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:36,054
There are 15 million women

00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:38,290
in the U. S. alone
in that demographic.

00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,992

about this business?

00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,126
It's so simple.

00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:44,096
You have one SKU,
and it sells for 30 bucks.

00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:45,330
Makes sense.

00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,532
What I don't like
about the product

00:27:46,532 --> 00:27:49,334
is I think tucking,
cropping is a trend,

00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,403
and I'm worried about
what happens

00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,305
when it goes the other way,
the trend.

00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:55,140

I hope
I'm wrong on that.

00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,309
