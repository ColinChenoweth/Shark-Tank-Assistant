00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:03,657
HI, EVERYONE.

00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:05,659
MY NAME IS JONATHAN BOOS,

00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:08,662
AND I'M THE OWNER OF
THE MEN'S BRAND WURKIN STIFFS,

00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:12,099
AS WELL AS THE INVENTOR
OF POWER STAYS,

00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:14,568
THE WORLD'S ONLY
MAGNETIC COLLAR STAYS.

00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:18,138
I'M SEEKING $85,000
FOR 10% EQUITY IN MY COMPANY.

00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,208
NOW THIS ALL STARTED BACK
WHEN I WAS ACTUALLY RUNNING LATE

00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,876
FOR SOME DINNER RESERVATIONS.

00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:25,712
MY WIFE WAS YELLING AS SHE THREW
A BRAND‐NEW SHIRT AT ME

00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:29,182
TO PUT ON, AND I'D SEEN
THAT I HAD A‐A BIG PROBLEM.

00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:31,685
I LOOKED LIKE JOHN TRAVOLTA
FROM "SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER."

00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:34,121
THE COLLAR WAS ALL LARGE
AND IN CHARGE,

00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:36,556
AND I COULDN'T CONTROL
THIS THING,

00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,759
SO I FOUND
SOME ORDINARY PAPER CLIPS,

00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,761
AND I FOUND SOME MAGNETS,

00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:43,563
AND I MADE THE VERY FIRST
MAGNETIC COLLAR STAY.

00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:45,999
I HAVEN'T WORN A SHIRT
THE SAME SINCE.

00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,502
SO FIRST YOU TAKE
OUR POWER STAY...

00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,371
AND YOU PLACE IT ON
THE UNDERSIDE OF THE COLLAR.

00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,473
THERE'S A COLLAR STAY POCKET.

00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:57,944
FLIP THE COLLAR DOWN,

00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:02,082
AND WE HAVE
A SUPERSTRONG, SMALL MAGNET,

00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:04,785
AND THIS GOES ON THE INSIDE
OF THE SHIRT...

00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:07,587
AND INSTANTLY CHANGED
MY SHIRT

00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,756
INTO
A HIDDEN BUTTON‐DOWN COLLAR.

00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:13,360
SO WHEREVER YOU PUT
YOUR COLLAR

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,196
IS WHERE YOUR COLLAR STAYS.

00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:20,033
AND THERE'S NOTHING ELSE LIKE
THIS IN THE MENSWEAR INDUSTRY.

00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:23,503

THANK YOU. WE KNEW WE HAD
SOMETHING PRETTY SPECIAL

HIGH‐END MEN'S SPECIALTY STORES.

00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:28,675
WHAT RETAILERS
DO YOU SELL THEM IN?

00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:31,678
NORDSTROM CONTACTED US. WE DID
A TEST OF OUR POWER STAYS,

00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,714
WHICH LAUNCHED IN 24 STORES.

00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,083

WE HAD SOLD
OVER 18,000 UNITS.

00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:41,288
WE MADE THEM
OVER $600,000 RETAIL.

00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,430

LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:26,233
OKAY. OKAY.
I LOVE YOUR PASSION. I LOVE YOUR
KNOWLEDGE. I LOVE YOUR APPROACH.

00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:29,035
I'M WAITING FOR THE "BUT."
YEAH, THERE'S A "BUT" COMING.

00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,638
I'M NOT THE GUY
WITH THE CONNECTIONS.

00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:34,207
I'M NOT THE GUY
WHO ADDS VALUE.

00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:37,010

DO ANYTHING FOR YOUR BUSINESS...
OKAY.

00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:43,216
SO I'M OUT.

00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:46,586
THE GUY THAT'S STAYING
THE MOST QUIET IS THE ONE

00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:51,491
THAT CAN HELP ME THE MOST,
BUT HE'S STAYING QUIET.
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.

00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:56,429
I'LL GIVE YOU $100,000
FOR 30% OF THE BUSINESS, <i>BUT...</i>

00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:59,533
I WANT A ROYALTY
ON THAT MONEY.

00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:02,969
I WANT A 14% ROYALTY.

00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:10,343
SO IT'S LIKE A LOAN.
NO. I'M GETTING A TON OF EQUITY,
TOO. I WANT 30% OF THE COMPANY.

00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,078
IT'S A LOAN, RIGHT?

00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:14,347
NO, IT'S NOT A LOAN.

00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,950
ROBERT'S GIVING ME THE EYE
THAT IT'S A LOAN.

00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,719

YOU KNOW, I LOVE ROBERT.
HE LOVES TO GIVE‐‐
I LOVE ROBERT, TOO!

00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:26,259
ROBERT GIVES YOU THE EYE,
BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY MONEY.

00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,662
THAT'S THE PROBLEM. IN THE END,
YOU NEED CASH, MY FRIEND.

00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,898

NEVER DISRESPECT THE CASH.
DON'T LIKE THAT DEAL.

I'LL KEEP DOING IT.

00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:43,443

GREAT. ANYONE ELSE?
WHY DON'T YOU LIKE HIS OFFER?

00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:52,719
I NEED MORE THAN MONEY.
I NEED SOMEONE THAT CAN HELP ME.

00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:00,694
DAYMOND, YOU‐‐YOU SOLD HATS.

00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:04,798
ONE PRODUCT, RIGHT? AND THEN YOU
CREATED THIS EMPIRE OF A BRAND.

00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:08,501
(Robert) OOH.
SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME
LIKE I CAN'T MAKE THIS

00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:11,905
INTO A SUCCESSFUL BRAND.
THAT'S WHAT I DON'T GET.

00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:16,042
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM.
I DIDN'T SAY YOU CAN'T MAKE IT
INTO A SUCCESSFUL BRAND.

00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,812
I‐‐
PEOPLE WHO ARE SUCCESSFUL
HAVE THOUGHTS OF HIGH VALUE,

00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:21,948
AND PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT
HAVE THOUGHTS OF LOW VALUE,

00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:25,452
SO YOU'RE VALUING YOURSELF
HIGH‐‐
HOW AM I VALUING MYSELF HIGH?
85 THOUS‐‐

00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:28,154
YOU SHOULD BE, BUT IF YOU'RE
GONNA ARGUE WITH ME...

WHO'S GONNA ARGUE WITH ME...
I'M NOT‐‐I'M‐‐DAYMOND...

00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,628
SO JUST‐‐BECAUSE OF THAT...
YOU, OUT OF ANYBODY, SHOULD
UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M DOING.

00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:37,764
I MEAN, I DON'T‐‐
I DON'T GET IT.
I WAS ACTUALLY GONNA THROW

00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:45,972
I STILL AM NOT DONE TALKING.
I'M OUT.

00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,340
I‐I KNEW IT.

00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,111
JONATHAN, YOU'VE ABSOLUTELY
PISSED HIM OFF.

00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:53,546
TO CLARIFY WHAT I WAS
TRYING TO TELL YOU

00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:56,383
WAS THE REASON THAT
YOU WILL BE WEALTHY

00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:59,119
IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE
THOUGHTS OF HIGH VALUE.

00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:02,489
I WAS TRYING TO GIVE YOU
A COMPLIMENT.
OKAY.

00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:06,359
WHEN I WAS TRYING TO TALK,
I COULD NOT SPEAK TO YOU.

00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,962
YOU TOOK FOREVER.
I'M‐‐I'M WAITING FOR‐‐

BOOM GOES THE DYNAMITE!

00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:14,901
I'M SORRY. AND I'M SORRY, AND I
WILL NEVER TAKE FOREVER AGAIN,

00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:17,637
BECAUSE I WAS GONNA
GIVE YOU AN OFFER,

00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:20,373
AND YOU BOTCHED THE OFFER.
OH, WHAT A BABY.

00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:23,476
MY GOD.
YOU WANT ME TO GET ON
THE PHONE WITH HIM EVERY DAY?

00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:28,014
"HEY, CAN I TALK TO..."
(imitates babbling) "CLICK."
I'LL PUT IT IN THE CONTRACT
I'LL NEVER CALL YOU AGAIN.

00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:30,083
HOW'S THAT SOUND?
(laughter)

00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:33,753
I CANNOT STAND PARTNERS
THAT I CAN'T EVEN SPEAK TO.

00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:37,457
IF HE WOULD HAVE SHUT UP,
HE WOULD HAVE HAD AN OFFER.

00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,330
I'M GONNA APOLOGIZE, FOR REAL.
I APOLOGIZE. I DIDN'T MEAN

00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:47,100
TO COME OFF THAT WAY. IF I'VE
OFFENDED YOU IN ANY WAY...
YOU DID NOT OFFEN‐‐

00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,669
THEN I WOULD DO
NOTHING DIFFERENT.
YOU DID NOT OFFEND ME.
I'M NOT OFFENDED.

00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,705
MY FEELINGS AREN'T HURT‐‐
I'M‐‐I'M JUST‐‐

00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:54,741
I THINK YOU'RE MISSING OUT

00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:57,344
YOU'RE SUCH A BABY. CUT IT OUT.
LISTEN, BARB.
I HAVE PET PEEVES. YOU DO.

00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:59,646
IF THIS IS A PET PEEVE,
GET OVER IT.

00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:03,917
WOW, YOU REALLY HURT
HIS FEELINGS, JONATHAN.
LET ME TALK TO ROBERT,
MY LAST CHANCE, AND THEN‐‐

00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:07,253
AND THEN‐‐SIT THERE AND JUST
THINK ABOUT IT. I'M A NICE GUY.

00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:10,757
THEN I'LL
STOP TALKING. OKAY.
JONATHAN, IT'S NOT THE FIRST
TIME YOU'VE HEARD THAT, IS IT?

00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:13,760
"NO"? OH, YEAH. I WOULDN'T BE
HERE IF I TOOK NO FOR AN ANSWER.

00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,564
NEXT.
I'M ACTUALLY UPSET.
YOU KNOW WHY? 'CAUSE I LIKE IT.

00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:20,033
WELL, AND I LIKE...
WHATEVER.

00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:23,269
SEE? (high‐pitched voice)
"WHATEVER."
I MEAN‐‐NO, I WOULD
TALK TO YOU, BUT YOU‐‐

00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:26,306
"YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK
WE SHOULD DO WITH THE COMP‐‐"

00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:29,609
(high‐pitched voice)
"WHATEVER."
NO, NO, NOT WHATEVER. DAYMOND,
I'M HERE TO... ALL RIGHT.

00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,878
DAYMOND, HE'S NERVOUS.
HE'S A HIGH‐ENERGY GUY.

00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:35,582
WHY DON'T YOU CUT HIM
A LITTLE SLACK?
WHY DON'T <i>YOU</i> CUT HIM A CHECK?

00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:37,817
THIS IS ALL WONDERFUL. LET'S
HOLD HANDS AND SAY "KUMBAYA."

00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:41,588
JONATHAN, DO YOU WANT
MY $100,000 OR NOT?

00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:56,870
<i>(man) JONATHAN HAS</i>
<i>AN OFFER FROM KEVIN,</i>

00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:02,175
<i>BUT THE ONE SHARK HE MOST</i>
<i>WANTED TO DEAL WITH IS OUT.</i>

00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:05,512
DO YOU WANT
MY $100,000 OR NOT?

00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:07,947
JONATHAN,
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.

00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:12,585
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $100,000
FOR 30%, NO ROYALTY.

00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,460
WOULD YOU GO $200,000
FOR 30%?

00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,129
WAIT A SECOND. I'LL DROP
MY EQUITY ASSET DOWN.

00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:27,567
$100,000 FOR 20%, BUT I WANT
THE ROYALTY TO STAY IN PLACE.

00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,336
THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN
WHAT HE WANTS. HE'S A SAVAGE.

00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:33,173
HE'S ASKING FOR
A <i>THIRD</i> OF YOUR BUSINESS.

00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:35,208
YOU'RE A VULTURE!
(Mark laughs)

00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,710
BECAUSE, I MEAN, I SHOULD
BE GETTING THE ROYALTY HERE.

00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,914
I MEAN, I'M THE ONE
THAT'S CREATING THE STUFF.

00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,416
JONATHAN, I'LL GIVE YOU
$100,000 FOR 25%.

00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,685
UH, THAT'S MY FINAL OFFER.

00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,324
(Barbara) ONE MORE THING.

00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,326
I'M GONNA GO BACK IN.

00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,695
BARBARA!

00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,464
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YEAH.

00:09:57,464 --> 00:10:00,433
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU $100,000
FOR 20%,

00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:04,337
PROVIDED DAYMOND FORGIVES YOU.

00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,406
AND I'LL BE
YOUR FRONT MAN, DAYMOND.

00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:09,909
YOU NEVER HAVE TO TALK TO THIS
GUY. YOU JUST ENJOY HIS SUCCESS.

00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:12,045
AND YOU KNOW
I'M A GREAT FRONT MAN.

00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,483
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.
OH, DAYMOND.

00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:20,353
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH PERCENTAGE
ON THE COMPANY.
WHAT‐‐SO WHAT IS IT?

00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:23,123
YOU WANT TO MATCH HIS AT 25%?

00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,927
CAN'T TAKE LESS THAN 40%.

00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:31,431
(O'Leary) WHOO!
(Robert) OH, MY...

00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:32,499
WOW.

00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:34,400
JONATHAN, COME BACK TO DADDY!

00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,137
(Robert laughs)
COME BACK TO DADDY!

00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:41,674
I'M PUTTING A DIFFERENCE
OF ONLY 15% DUE TO MY KNOWLEDGE.

00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:44,978
THAT'S ALL.
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE.

00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:49,516
OKAY, I'LL DROP
MY EQUITY ASSET DOWN TO 15%,

00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:51,384
BUT THE ROYALTY
STAYS IN PLACE.

00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,460
WOULD‐‐WOULD DAYMOND AND BARBARA
BE WILLING TO DO 30%...

00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,229
THE $100,000 FOR 30% EQUITY?

00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,931
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,601
THE OFFER'S A HARD OFFER.

00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:15,208
JONATHAN, JONATHAN.
YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION NOW.

00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,117
YES, I WOULD LIKE TO DO A DEAL
WITH BARBARA AND DAYMOND.

00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:26,619
GREAT.
ALL RIGHT.

00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,222
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

(Barbara)
AW, THAT'S A HAPPY ENDING.
(Jonathan) THANK YOU.

00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:36,029
YOU KNOW WHAT? I DEAL WITH
CREATIVE GUYS LIKE DESIGNERS.

00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,231
YOU WILL NEVER GET A WORD IN,

00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:41,367
AND YOU'LL NEVER
GET ANYTHING DONE.
YOU WERE SPANKING HIM
LIKE A BABY SEAL.

00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:45,471
(laughs)
I ALMOST BLEW THE DEAL WITH
DAYMOND BECAUSE OF MY BIG MOUTH.

00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:46,973
BARBARA, LOVE YA.

00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:49,475
THANK YOU
FOR GETTING THAT HOOK OUT

00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,712

A REGISTERED DIETICIAN,

00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:25,425
WE FOCUS OUR BUSINESS

HEALTHY HABITS,

00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,928
AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY,
THE KIDS HAVING FUN.

00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,431
AND IN 2009, WE BEGAN
FRANCHISING OUR BUSINESS

00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,500
SO WE COULD REACH
AS MANY KIDS AS POSSIBLE.

00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,536
AND AS LONG AS PEOPLE
KEEP HAVING BABIES,

00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:38,237

ABOUT THAT. WHAT DO YOU CHARGE?

00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:51,451

OUR VISION IS
THE STAY‐AT‐HOME MOM.

00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,824
THE GREAT THING ABOUT TIPPI TOES
IS WE GO INTO PRESCHOOLS,

00:15:57,824 --> 00:15:59,992
AFTER‐SCHOOL ACTIVITIES,
UM, DAY CARE,

00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:03,162
SO WE DON'T HAVE
OVERHEAD OF A FACILITY,

00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,931
SO IT'S A LOW ENTRY COST,

00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:07,633
AND THEN, THEY PAY
A MONTHLY ROYALTY FEE TO US.

00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:11,904
SARAH, $30,000 ISN'T THAT LOW.
WHAT DO I GET FOR THAT $30,000?
$30,000‐‐
WE CREATED OUR OWN MUSIC.

00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:14,740
WE HAVE, UM, OUR FIRST CD,
"TIPPI'S TUNES"‐‐

00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,910
THAT'S A LESSON PLAN. UM,
WE GO OUT AND DO THE BUSINESS,

00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,746
THE SALES AND MARKETING
FOR THEM, THEY GET OUR‐‐

00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:23,249
SO I GIVE YOU $30,000,
YOU GIVE ME A CD,

00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:26,319
AND I GET PICTURES
OF THE INSECTS?
THEY'RE NOT INSECTS. THEY'RE
ADORABLE LITTLE CREATURES.

00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:29,322
SO RATHER THAN TAKING THEM
TO DANCE CLASS SOMEWHERE ELSE...
CORRECT.

00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:32,291
YOU'RE‐‐YOU HAVE A LICENSEE
WHO SAYS TO MY KID'S PRESCHOOL,

00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,293
"YOU KEEP THE KIDS THERE."
MM‐HMM.

00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,796
RIGHT? I'M GONNA CHARGE
THE PARENTS INDEPENDENTLY.

00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:39,799
THE PRESCHOOL OR SCHOOL IS JUST
GONNA LET ME USE THE FACILITIES

00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:42,268
BECAUSE IT'S JUST
A GOOD THING FOR THEM TO DO

00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:45,071
TO KEEP THEIR KIDS THERE...
YEAH, EXACTLY.

00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:49,942
AND THEN IT'S A WIN‐WIN.
IT'S VERY CLEVER. HOW MUCH MONEY
DOES YOUR COMPANY MAKE TODAY?

00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:53,479
LAST YEAR WE MADE $268,000.

00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:56,349
AND WHAT WAS YOUR PROFIT?
OUR PROFIT WAS $29,000.

00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,851
THE $30,000 THEY HAVE TO PAY
FOR THE FRANCHISE...
CORRECT.

00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,988
WHERE DO PEOPLE GET THAT MONEY?
UM, A LOT OF WHAT WE'VE DONE

00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:05,057
IS WE'VE DONE IT IN‐HOUSE, WHERE
WE'LL FINANCE IT OUT FOR 'EM.

00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,326
THEN, WE CAN MAKE MONEY
OFF THEIR INTEREST, WHICH‐‐

00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:09,829
SO, YOU MEAN THEY OWE YOU
THE $30,000...
CORRECT.

00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:13,866
AND THEN YOU START CHAR‐‐
LIKE, YOU GUYS ARE UNBELIEVABLE.
YOU <i>ARE</i> SHARKS.

00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,002
YOU MARCH INTO SOMEBODY
AND YOU SELL THEM

00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:18,504
$30,000 WORTH OF LIABILITY THEY
START PAYING YOU INTEREST ON

00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,506
'CAUSE THEY HAVEN'T
FUNDED IT YET.

00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:23,943
FORGET THIS. COME AND WORK
FOR ME AT O'LEARY FUNDS.

00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:26,712

SOME REAL MONEY.
WE'RE GONNA MAKE <i>YOU</i>
SOME REAL MONEY.

WHY CAN'T I‐‐
DOESN'T MATTER.
<i>THEY'RE</i> PROPRIETARY ABOUT THIS.

00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:32,685
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE TRIED THIS.
PEOPLE HEARD ABOUT US.

00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:54,840
OF VISION, YOU CAN‐‐
YOU CAN HAVE A REAL BUSINESS.
YOU KNOW WHAT? WE HAVE SO MANY
PARENTS COME TO US WHO SAY,

00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,843
"WE DID DANCE SOMEPLACE ELSE.

00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:00,913
THIS IS LIKE NOTHING ELSE
WE'VE EVER SEEN."
WHAT'S YOUR ONGOING ROYALTY

00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,916
THAT YOU'RE EARNING BACK
FROM THE‐‐THE FRANCHISEE?
THERE'S A MINIMUM ROYALTY
PAYMENT EACH MONTH, SO‐‐

00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,086
TELL ME WHAT
YOUR MINIMUM ROYALTY IS.
IT'S $1,000 EACH MONTH.

I CAN'T <i>BELIEVE</i> THIS!

THESE GUYS ARE GOOD!

00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:12,558
THESE GUYS ARE GOOD,
I'M TELLING YOU.
THAT'S $42,000. (laughs)

00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:23,002
MM‐HMM.
TALK TO ME
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:26,172
WHY THIS BUSINESS
IS WORTH $600,000.
WE WALKED IN THE DOORS
A FEW MINUTES AGO.

00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:28,674
SINCE THEN, WE HAVE
MORE KIDS IN "TIPPI TOES,"

00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:32,211
SO WE ARE GROWING
AT A RAPID PACE.
(chuckles)
LOVE THAT ATTITUDE.

00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:36,182

ONLY GIVING US 5%?
IF YOU WANT MORE,
NEGOTIATE WITH US.

00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:39,952
(Mark and Barbara laugh)
BOY, THAT'S GREAT.

00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:43,823
ARE THESE DVDs OR CDs?
THESE ARE CDs THAT WE HAVE
HERE. WE HOPE TO DO DVDs.

00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:47,360
SO YOU HAVEN'T
PRODUCED THE DVDs YET?
THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE HERE‐‐TODAY.

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,195
OH, I SEE.
OH, WOW.

00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:52,531
BUT GUYS, GUYS, WHY? YOU KNOW,
WHY GET INTO THE DVD BUSINESS,

00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:55,501
WHEREAS, YOU MIGHT MAKE, $5 TO
$10 A DVD IF YOU'RE LUCKY.

00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:59,905
THAT'S WHERE‐‐
THAT'S OUR VISION.
IT'S DOWN THE R‐‐WE'RE BUILDING
A BRAND. WE'RE BUILDING A BRAND.

00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:03,676
IS THAT WHERE
YOU'RE GOING WITH IT?
(Megan) THAT'S WHERE WE'RE
GOING WITH IT. LONG‐TERM.

00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:06,879
OUR BIG DREAM IS TO HAVE
THE NEXT BARNEY.
YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING,
WHAT YOU'RE DOING,

00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,881

SELLING THEM ANYTHING

00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:12,718
EXCEPT YOUR SMILING FACES.
(laughs) I HOPE YOU SEE MORE
BEHIND IT THAN THAT.

00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:15,721
I DON'T, ACTUALLY.
THE REST OF US DO,
BUT DON'T WORRY, GUYS.

00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:18,124

LIKE YOU ARE,

AND YOU CAN HIRE HIM.
YES, YES. THAT'LL WORK.

BUT YOU ARE GREAT EXTORTIONISTS.

DO WELL. I'M OUT.

YEAH.

AT THE END OF 10 YEARS‐‐
IT'S A 10‐YEAR COMMITMENT?

00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,717

WOW.

00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:46,886

APPLAUD THEM OR CALL THE POLICE.

THE HARDEST THING IN THE WORLD

00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:56,662

THEY'RE EXECUTING ON THEIR IDEA.
HOW DO YOU STOP THEM FROM
FOLLOWING THE DVD DEAL?

00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,164

FROM DOING THAT?
WELL, THEN,
THAT'S THE CHALLENGE, RIGHT?

TOO FAR AHEAD OF YOURSELF...
SURE.

00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:03,669
OKAY.

HOW YOU SCREW UP.

00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:06,672

GOT TO GROW ONE STEP AT A TIME.

00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:09,542
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T BUILD
A GREAT BUSINESS OVERNIGHT,

00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:14,547

TO TAKE TOO BIG A LEAP. I'M OUT.
I CAN'T GET NEAR YOUR VALUATION.
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE FOR ME.

00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,416
YET, I'M SO STUNNED BY WHAT
YOU'VE DONE... TO PEOPLE‐‐

00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,052

THESE CONTRACTS.

00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,755
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
I'LL GIVE YOU $50,000 FOR 51%.

00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,690
(scoffs)
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
WEAR ANKLE BRACELETS,

00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,693
AND EVERY TIME YOU MENTION‐‐
YOU MENTION THE WORD "DVD"?

00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,762
24‐VOLT SHOCK.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS.

00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:33,399
AND YOU STAY IN THE CARS
AND YOU SIGN THOSE CONTRACTS.

00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:38,204
THE PROBLEM IS 5%, EVEN ON
A BUSINESS THAT'S GROWING.

00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:40,806
OKAY.
YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO HAVE
TO COME BACK TO ME,

WELL, I THINK THE GENIUS
OF THIS WHOLE THING

00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,553
IS THAT YOU'VE FOUND A WAY
TO TAP INTO THE WORKING MOM

00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:57,523

ARE AT SCHOOL.
MM‐HMM.

00:20:57,523 --> 00:21:02,094
I DON'T THINK THERE'S
A LIMIT TO WHAT YOU COULD DO.

00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,096
BUT I THINK
THE 5% ISN'T ENOUGH

00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,465
TO GET ME EXCITED
TO BE IN WITH YOU.

00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,901
OKAY.
SO I NEED
A LARGER PERCENTAGE.

00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:11,771
SO RATHER THAN ASK YOU
TO NAME A NUMBER BACK TO ME,

00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:16,442
I'M GONNA SAY THAT I'D LIKE
TO GET 20% OF YOUR BUSINESS...

00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:17,943
OKAY.

00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,613

00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:26,952

00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:30,956

(Mark) BEFORE YOU COME BACK‐‐

00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:37,329
ARE YOU GOING TO COME BACK
AND MAKE A COUNTER‐OFFER?
MM‐HMM.

00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:39,799
OKAY. BEFORE YOU COME BACK
WITH A COUNTEROFFER,

00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,934
HERE'S THE SCENARIO.
OKAY.

TELL ME THAT YOU WILL SAY YES

00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:55,414
IMMEDIATELY,

OKAY.

00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:56,849

00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:02,394
ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS,
IS RUNNING RIGHT AROUND 63%.

00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,963
HOW IS THIS BUSINESS WORTH
$800,000 TODAY?

00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:06,965
YOU'VE ONLY GOT $30,000
IN SALES.

00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:10,169
YOU'RE NOT MAKING ANY MONEY.
WHAT I HAVE IS COMMITMENTS

00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:13,806
FROM TWO SUPERMARKETS
THAT SAID TO ME‐‐

00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:16,408
THEY FLEW ME IN AFTER TASTING
EXACTLY WHAT YOU TASTED

00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,911
AND SAID, "YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE WANT YOU IN HERE."

00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:22,014
SO THESE ARE ONLY
2 SUPERMARKETS OUT OF 32,000

00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:24,817
ACROSS THIS COUNTRY.
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE THAT ORDER.

00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:27,853
I WILL HAVE THIS ORDER
WITHIN THE NEXT TEN DAYS.
AND THAT ORDER WILL BE HOW BIG?

00:26:27,853 --> 00:26:31,056
FOR THE BURGERS, 600 CASES,
AND FOR THE SLIDERS, 300 CASES.

00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:33,692
WHAT WOULD THE DOLLAR AMOUNT
OF THOSE ORDERS BE?

00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:35,327
$87,200.

00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:39,298
SO YOU'VE GOT $30,000
IN SALES THIS YEAR.
YES.

00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:42,234
LET'S SAY IT'S $100,000
IN ORDERS THIS YEAR.
OKAY. OKAY.

00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:44,503
HOW MUCH MONEY WILL YOU MAKE
ON $100,000?

00:26:44,503 --> 00:26:48,340
I WOULD MAKE ROUGHLY 53%.

00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,842
(sighs)

00:26:49,842 --> 00:26:52,311
(Mark) MAN, I'VE GOTTA SAY,
I LIKE THE CONCEPT.

00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:55,948
YOU'VE GOT A CUSTOMER IN ME.
I'LL‐‐I'LL BUY THE PRODUCT.

00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:59,818
BUT I REALLY CAN'T ADD VALUE.
I DON'T KNOW THE FOOD BUSINESS.

00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:02,821
I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY
THAT I'M OUT.

00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:05,023
(Barbara)
AND, SHAWN, I HAVE TO SAY,

00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:07,259
I JUST DON'T LIKE SHRIMP AT ALL,

00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:09,361
SO I'M JUST GOING OUT
ON THAT BASIS.

00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:11,997
(O'Leary) YOU AND I ARE
ACTUALLY DOING BUSINESS

00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:15,534
TOGETHER RIGHT NOW.
YOU JUST DON'T KNOW IT.

00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:19,338
I OWN THE DEBT OF ONE
OF THE LARGEST MANUFACTURERS

00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:21,940
OF CRUSTACEAN AND PROTEINS
OFF THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN.

00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,610
I ALWAYS KNEW YOU WERE
A BOTTOM‐FEEDER, KEVIN.

00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:27,246
SHAWN, MY CONCERN
IS YOUR MARGINS...

00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:29,381
YES, SIR.
AREN'T HIGH ENOUGH.

00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:32,384
THEY HAVE TO BE NORTH OF 70%
IN SEAFOOD, BECAUSE IT REQUIRES

00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:34,820
A HEAVY COMMITMENT
TO REFRIGERATION AND STORAGE

00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,823
AND ALSO ACCESS TO SUPPLY
OF THE PROTEIN YOU'RE USING,

00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:40,325
WHICH IS
THE MOST EXPENSIVE FOOD WE EAT

00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:43,896
AND THE MOST VULNERABLE TO
PRICE INCREASES AND DECREASES.

00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:46,498
SO AT THE END OF THE DAY,

00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,967
UM, TO ME, WHILE IT'S
AN INTERESTING FOOD CONCEPT,

00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:51,470
IT'S PROBABLY
ONE OF THE MORE RISKY,

00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,672
AND, UH,
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.

00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:57,242
OKAY. OKAY.

00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:59,545
(Robert)
SHAWN, I LOVE THE PRODUCT.

00:27:59,545 --> 00:28:01,914
$200,000 FOR YOUR COMPANY‐‐

00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:05,184
I DON'T THINK
YOUR WHOLE COMPANY IS WORTH

00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,452
$200,000 TO $300,000 TODAY.

00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:10,856
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BUILD IT

00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:14,293
AND IT'S GONNA BE SUCCESSFUL.
THIS IS NOT
A ONE‐DIMENSIONAL PRODUCT.

00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:16,395
THESE ARE SHRIMP BURGERS.
AMERICA LOVES SHRIMP.

00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:18,864
IT'S THE NUMBER ONE
SEAFOOD PRODUCT.

00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:21,366
I LOVE THE SHRIMP.
I HATE THE VALUATION.

00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,602
THE COMPANY
ISN'T WORTH THAT TODAY.

00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:25,637
FOR THAT REASON, UH, I'M OUT.

00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,573
OKAY.

DAYMOND?

00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:39,685
I LIKED THOSE BURGERS. I‐‐
LOOK, I ATE 'EM. BOTH OF 'EM.

00:28:39,685 --> 00:28:43,088
AND I'M GONNA EAT THE OTHER

00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:46,091

00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:48,594
YOU'RE VALUATING
YOUR COMPANY AT $800,000.

00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:52,364
I CAN'T GET AROUND IT,
SO I HAVE TO SAY...

00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:54,933
WELL, I'M WILLING TO‐‐
I'M WILLING TO...

00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:58,570
INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE
TO BUY INTO MY COMPANY.

00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:04,710
I'M WILLING TO DO THAT.

00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,545
WHAT PERCENTAGE?

00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:09,414
I'M WILLING TO GO UP TO 30%.

00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:12,918
YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO'S
PASSIONATE ABOUT THE PRODUCT.

00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:15,587
YOU HAVE SOMEBODY
WHO LOVES THIS BUSINESS.

00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,257
YOU HAVE SOMEBODY
WHO STUDIED THIS BUSINESS.

00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:21,793
I HAVE THE STRONG PASSION
AND KNOW HOW TO DO IT.

00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,069
WHAT IF I OFFER 40%
OF THE COMPANY?

00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,542
EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU IS RIGHT
EXCEPT FOR THAT NUMBER,

00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:40,145
AND YOU'RE NOW AT 40%
FOR $200,000,

00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:43,081
SO NOW YOU'RE VALUATING
THE COMPANY AT ABOUT...

00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:44,883
ROUGHLY $570,000.
$500,000.

00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:46,952
YES, SIR. $500,000.

00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:50,255
I'D BE BUYING MORE INTO YOU
'CAUSE YOU'RE A GREAT GUY

00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:53,592

EVEN IF HE HAS THOSE ORDERS,

EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON.

00:34:55,794 --> 00:34:58,697
I THINK THE PACKAGING
IS THE PLAY.
RIGHT.

00:34:58,697 --> 00:35:01,466
HOW LONG DOES IT STAY FRESH?
WE'RE GOOD FOR A YEAR.

00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:03,368
THE CHALLENGE WITH ANYTIME

00:35:03,368 --> 00:35:05,503
THAT YOU REDUCE IT DOWN
TO A SMALL AMOUNT,

00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:07,872
IS THAT THE SHELF LIFE
IS VERY, VERY SHORT.

00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:09,441
USUALLY, 30 DAYS.
WELL...

00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:11,509
YOU'RE GETTING A YEAR
OUT OF IT.

00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:13,445
HAVE YOU PATENTED
THIS PACKAGING?
ABSOLUTELY.

00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:18,016
NOT ONLY DID WE CREATE A WAY TO
ATMOSPHERICALLY PACKAGE LIQUID,

00:35:18,016 --> 00:35:20,151
WE'VE CREATED A WAY THAT
WHEN ALCOHOL VOLATILIZES

00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,654
UNDER HEAT OR PRESSURE,
IT WON'T BLOW THE SEAL.

00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:25,056
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
THE TOP LABORATORIES

00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,993
IN THE‐‐IN THE WORLD THAT HAVE
WORKED ON THIS PROJECT.

00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:32,097
WHERE ARE YOU SELLING IT?
ALL THE KROGER CHAINS,
RALPHS, 7‐ELEVEN.

00:35:32,097 --> 00:35:35,266
UM, WE'RE IN DISCUSSIONS
WITH THEM.
WHY ARE WE EVEN
IN THE WINE BUSINESS?

00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:37,836
WHY AREN'T WE LICENSING THIS
TO ALL THE WINERIES?

00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:40,839
WHY AREN'T WE GOING TO MONDAVI
AND EVERYBODY ELSE AND SAYING,

00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:42,540
"BUY THIS"?

00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,143
WE ARE. BUT RIGHT NOW
WE'RE WORKING ON PROJECTS

00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,880
WITH TWO OF THE NINE LARGEST
WINE COMPANIES IN‐‐IN THE WORLD.
YEAH, HOW MUCH MONEY ARE YOU
GONNA MAKE OFF THOSE DEALS?

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,717
ESTIMATES NEXT YEAR IS ABOUT
$3 MILLION TO $5 MILLION.
OF SALES?

00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:55,253
OF SALES.
NOW I HAVE
A DIFFERENT QUESTION.

00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:58,456
WHY DO WE EVEN NEED TO BE IN
THE PACKAGING BUSINESS AT ALL?

00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:02,827
MM‐HMM.
WHY IS THIS NOT A PATENT ASSET
THAT WE GO AND MARKET TO

00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,829
THE LARGEST PACKAGING COMPANIES
ON EARTH?

00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,832
YOU KNOW, THE WINE INDUSTRY
RIGHT NOW NEEDS COMPANIES

00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:10,435
LIKE MINE TO SERVICE THEM
FOR THESE NICHE NEEDS.

00:36:10,435 --> 00:36:13,438
THEY DON'T WANT TO INVEST INTO
EQUIPMENT AND HAVE TO LEARN‐‐

00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:16,074
ESPECIALLY THIS PROCESS.
THIS IS AN ART. THIS IS NOT‐‐

00:36:16,074 --> 00:36:19,044
THIS IS A PROOF OF CONCEPT
IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

00:36:19,044 --> 00:36:21,446
THEY WANT TO KNOW IT WORKS,

00:36:21,446 --> 00:36:24,683
'CAUSE THEY'VE SEEN IT
FAIL SO MANY TIMES.
OH, ABSOLUTELY. YEAH.

00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:27,786
SO THIS IS HIS WAY
OF SHOWING THAT IT WORKS.
LISTEN, THERE'S A BELIEF‐‐

00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:30,522
PIONEERS GET SLAUGHTERED,
AND SETTLERS PROSPER.

00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:33,792
WITH THAT SAID, YOU'RE JUST
TOO EARLY FOR ME. I'M OUT.

00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:36,327
JAMES, IS THERE A WAY
TO TAKE THE PATENT

00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:39,731
OUT OF
COPA DI VINA‐‐DI VINO?

00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:41,366
MM‐HMM.

00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:45,036
I REALLY LIKE YOUR PATENT.
CAN WE PULL THE TWO APART?

00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,707
CAN WE SEPARATE
THE LICENSING, I. P.‐‐

00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,709
FOR CLARITY, I. P.‐‐
THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:53,678
I.P. AS A SEPARATE ENTITY

00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:56,414
AND LEAVE YOU
WITH THE WINE BUSINESS?
WE CAN.

00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:59,050
SO IF YOU CAN COME BACK
TO ME AND SAY,

00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,453
"MARK, HERE'S HOW I'D VALUE
THE PATENT,

00:37:01,453 --> 00:37:04,155
"THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY,
HERE'S HOW MUCH CASH I'D LIKE,

00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:07,625
AND HERE'S HOW MUCH STOCK
I'M WILLING TO OFFER"...
MM‐HMM.

00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:10,295
I'M WIDE OPEN TO THAT.
YEP.

00:37:10,295 --> 00:37:13,364
AND THEN YOU CAN OWN AND RUN
WITH YOUR WINE COMPANY...
MM‐HMM.

00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:16,334
AND BUILD AS BIG A BRAND
AS YOU LIKE.
MARK, YOU‐‐YOU HAVE‐‐

00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:19,637
YOUR ATTENDANCE IN YOUR STADIUMS
EVERY YEAR IS RISING.

00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:22,640
OH, NO. IT'S NOT LOST TO ME
THAT I COULD RESELL THESE.
ABSOLUTELY.

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,543
NOT LOST TO ME THAT
I COULD STILL BE A CUSTOMER.
I MEAN,
IF YOU MADE A FEW CALLS,

00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:28,546
HOW MANY STADIUMS WOULD
THIS PRODUCT BE SOLD IN?
I'M NOT QUESTIONING THAT
AT ALL...

00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:31,049
ABSOLUTELY.
BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE IN
THE COMMISSION SALES BUSINESS.

00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:34,252
YEAH.
LET'S GET FOCUSED ON THAT, SO
THAT AT LEAST I CAN UNDERSTAND,

00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,354
IF I GAVE YOU A CHECK
FOR $600,000,

00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:39,057
HOW MUCH OF THE I. P. COMPANY
AND BOTTLER I COULD OWN.

00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:41,259
HOW MUCH IS THAT?

00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:45,029
HOW MUCH ARE YOU WILLING
TO SELL ME FOR $600,000?
20%.

00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:48,733
NOT ENOUGH.
YOU'VE ALREADY DEVALUED
THE BRAND TO WORTH THIS MUCH...

00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:51,703
(Daymond)
THEY DIDN'T DEVALUE IT.
NO, NO, NO. WE DIDN'T DEVALUE
IT TO ZERO. NOT AT ALL.

00:37:51,703 --> 00:37:54,672
(Daymond) THEY JUST SAID
THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED IN IT.
OR A NEGATIVE.

00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:58,143
NO, NO. IT'S JUST THAT WE DON'T
WANT TO BE IN THAT BUSINESS.
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY SAID
IT'S NOT WORTH ANYTHING. WE‐‐

00:37:58,143 --> 00:38:00,712
YEAH. YEAH.
BUT I THINK FOR ME, I'M NOT
GONNA TRY TO TALK YOU INTO

00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:03,715
SPLITTING ONE FROM THE OTHER,
AND MY GUT FEEL IS,

00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:06,951
IT'S NOT THE DIRECTION
YOU WANT TO DO TODAY.

00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:11,289
I'M NOT A WINE GUY. I DON'T
WANT TO BUILD THE BRAND,

00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,425
SO I'M OUT FOR THAT REASON.

00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,728
JAMES, I DON'T THINK

00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:22,033
I CAN BRING ANYTHING
TO THE TABLE IN THIS.

00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:24,335
I'M OUT.

00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:27,806
THE REAL VALUE IN
ALL OF THIS IS THE I. P...

00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:31,109
UH‐HUH.
BECAUSE IF YOU REALLY OWN IT,
THIS CATEGORY COULD EXPLODE,

00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:34,112
AND YOU WILL MAKE SOMETHING OFF
EVERY TIME SOMEBODY RIPS

00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:37,916
THE TOP OFF ONE
OF THESE PLASTIC OR GLASS‐‐
SURE. YEP.

00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:41,319
THAT'S A BUSINESS, MY FRIEND.
THAT'S HOW YOU GET RICH.
ABSOLUTELY. YEP.

00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,321
NOW CAN YOU FOCUS ON THAT

00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:46,324
AND TELL ME HOW MUCH OF THAT
YOU'D SELL ME FOR $600,000?

00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,261

00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,171

AND TELL ME HOW MUCH OF THAT
YOU'D SELL ME FOR $600,000?

00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,854
THE REALITY
OF WHAT YOU'RE ASKING IS,

00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:17,689
SOME OF
THE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES

00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:20,391
THAT I HAVE AS A BRAND
AND AS A BOTTLER,

00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:23,394
I'M GONNA BE OFFERING AND GIVING
AWAY TO ANOTHER ENTITY,

00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:25,930
AND CURRENTLY I'M NOT READY
TO DO THAT.

00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:29,334
I FEEL A HUGE OPPORTUNITY
BEING LOST HERE.

00:39:29,334 --> 00:39:30,802
I UNDERSTAND BUSINESS.

00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:33,271
I UNDERSTAND NUMBERS.
I'VE RUN THE NUMBERS.

00:39:33,271 --> 00:39:36,274
THE AMOUNT OF MONEY I'LL MAKE
ON THE I. P. SIDE IS FAR SMALLER

00:39:36,274 --> 00:39:38,109
THAN THE GREAT AMOUNT
OF MONEY

00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:40,578
THAT I'LL MAKE
ON THE BOTTLING SIDE.
OKAY.

00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:41,946
REALLY?
ABSOLUTELY.

00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:46,251
ISOLATE THE I. P., ALL RIGHT?
YEP.

00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:50,221
I'LL BUY 51% OF IT FOR $600,000.
I'LL TAKE CONTROL OF THAT,

00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,724
AND I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES
IN TERMS OF LICENSING THIS

00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,292
TO EVERYBODY IN THE INDUSTRY.

00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:57,228
I'LL WORRY ABOUT YOUR DARKEST
FEAR OF NOT MAKING ANY MONEY.

00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:00,265
I'LL STILL SLEEP AT NIGHT.
DON'T WORRY.
MM‐HMM.

00:40:00,265 --> 00:40:03,835
AND THEN YOU CAN RUN THE BRAND,
YOU CAN RUN THE BOTTLING,

00:40:03,835 --> 00:40:07,338
BUT I WILL LICENSE THIS TO THEM.
BUT EVERY TIME THAT HAPPENS,

00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:10,341
YOU'LL BE GETTING 49% OF
WHAT I BRING HOME EVERY MONTH.

00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:13,411
SURE. THE OPPORTUNITY IS
GREATER THAN THAT.

00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,914
THE OPPORTUNITY IS
FAR GREATER THAN THAT.

00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:19,017
HIS DEAL IS FAR BETTER
THAN WHAT I WOULD OFFER.

00:40:19,017 --> 00:40:22,287
REASON BEING, YOU CAN TAKE
THE $600,000 AND USE IT

00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:24,722
AS YOU PLEASE AND ACCOMPLISH
EVERYTHING YOU WANTED

00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:27,425
TO ACCOMPLISH ON THE OTHER END
AND INVEST IN THAT...
MM‐HMM.

00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,094
HOWEVER YOU WANT TO INVEST
AND GET ALL THE UPSIDE.
MM‐HMM.

00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,563
I WOULD NEVER DO A DEAL
LIKE THAT,

00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:34,899
SO FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.

00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:39,170
I‐I HONESTLY THINK

00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:42,774
THAT IF I COULD EXPLAIN
TO YOU GUYS A LITTLE CLEARER‐‐

00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:45,576
DON'T.
YOU'RE HURTING YOURSELF.
(Daymond)
DON'T SAY ANY MORE.

00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:49,013
(O'Leary) NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO. JAMES, JAMES, JAMES‐‐
STOP SELLING, JAMES.
YOU GOTTA STOP SELLING.

00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:52,717
I'M A DREAM COME TRUE
FOR YOU.

00:40:52,717 --> 00:40:56,220
DO I BELIEVE THIS HAS
A GREAT OPPORTUNITY? ABSOLUTELY.

00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,656
HAVE I PUT
OVER A MILLION DOLLARS

00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:01,159
OF MY OWN MONEY INTO THIS?
I HAVE.

00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:04,128
AND IS THAT WORTH GOING AHEAD
AND SELLING, AT THIS POINT

00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,731
WHAT WE'VE‐‐WHAT WE'VE CREATED,
OFF TO SOMEBODY ELSE

00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:08,733
TO CONTROL THAT PORTION OF IT?

00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:10,935
THAT'S THE SPECIAL SAUCE.
WE ALL KNOW THAT.

00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:14,605
WHY GIVE AWAY YOUR SPECIAL SAUCE
WHEN YOU CAN HAVE IT INTEGRATED

00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:16,975
INTO THE OTHER ASPECTS
OF YOUR BUSINESS

00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:18,977
THAT RIGHT NOW
ARE SUCCESSFUL?

00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,979
I'M WORKING ON‐‐ON‐‐ON,
RIGHT NOW,

00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:23,314
CONTRACTS OF OVER
$15 MILLION TO $20 MILLION

00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:26,484
ON PRIVATE LABEL PROJECTS
WITH 7‐ELEVEN, WITH TARGET,

00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:30,455
WITH SOME OF THE BIGGEST
WINE COMPANIES IN THE WORLD.

00:41:30,455 --> 00:41:34,292
WILL HE GET AN ANSWER
AT ANY POINT?
(O'Leary) LOOK, JAMES‐‐

00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:35,793
THE ANSWER IS NO.

00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:40,631
WELL, THEN COUNTER ME.
WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR 51%?

00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:42,934
$3 MILLION.

00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:45,870
FORGET IT. NOT A CHANCE.

00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:49,807
JAMES, LISTEN TO ME,
I AM GOING TO GO BUY

00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:52,744
A THOUSAND‐DOLLAR BOTTLE
OF WINE TONIGHT,

00:41:52,744 --> 00:41:54,312
AND I'M GONNA DRINK IT,

00:41:54,312 --> 00:41:56,314
BECAUSE I'M WEEPING FOR
THE OPPORTUNITY YOU LOST.

00:41:56,314 --> 00:41:58,983
IT'S THE ONLY WAY I CAN
FEEL BETTER ABOUT IT,

00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:01,886
AND THEN I'LL NEVER REMEMBER
IT AGAIN, AND I WON'T CARE,

00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:03,888
BECAUSE THERE'S
A MILLION OPPORTUNITIES

00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:06,891
THAT ARE GONNA COME TO ME
TOMORROW. THIS WAS YOUR MOMENT.
MM‐HMM.

00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:10,161
YOU TURNED AROUND. IT'S GONE.

00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:12,497
YOU LOOKED A GIFT HORSE
IN THE MOUTH, JAMES.

00:42:12,497 --> 00:42:14,365
OHH.
YOU REALLY DID.

00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,834
CHEERS.
(Daymond and Robert)
CHEERS.

00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:18,970
THANK YOU, GUYS.

00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:21,973
THE GUY NEEDED ME TO GET FOCUSED
ON WHAT REALLY MATTERED.

00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:24,909
YOU COULD'VE‐‐LOOK, YOU COULD'VE
MADE MONEY ON THAT SIDE OF IT,

00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:28,212
BUT HE HAD A GRAND SLAM,
AND HE DIDN'T KNOW IT.
I FORGET WHO HE IS.
I DON'T CARE NOW. IT'S OVER.

00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:31,916
HE'S A DEAD MAN WALKING,
JUST ANOTHER DEAL.
RIGHT.

00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:33,918
KEVIN TOTALLY MISSED THE MARK.

00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:35,920
THE VALUE ON OUR PRODUCT
<i>IS</i> THE BRAND.

00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,922
WE'RE THE FIRST TO DO
WINE BY THE GLASS.

00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:40,058
IT'S A HUGE OPPORTUNITY
AND A HUGE MARKET,

00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:42,060
AND WE'VE ALREADY PROVED THAT,
SO THE IDEA

00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,063
THAT WE'RE GONNA BREAK IT DOWN
TO ONE LITTLE COMPONENT,

00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:47,065
AND THAT IS SELL THE PATENTS,

00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:49,534
WOULD BE SELLING THE LIFE
OUT OF THE OPPORTUNITY.
