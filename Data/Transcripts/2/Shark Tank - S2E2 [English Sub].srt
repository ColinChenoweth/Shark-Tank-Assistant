FOR A BOX OF TOYS
THAT'S WORTH OVER $200.

00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,217

BASICALLY,

00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:52,886
IS IT COSTS THEM
ABOUT $500 A YEAR.

00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:55,689

$1,200 AND $1,400 A YEAR.

PER TOY BOX THAT YOU SHIP

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,596

RIGHT.

00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:15,575

00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:37,563
MY NAME IS MATTY SALLIN,

00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:40,399
AND I'M FROM
SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA.

00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:45,638
BY DAY, I'M A DESIGNER
FOR A BIG SOFTWARE COMPANY.

00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:47,139
BUT IN MY SPARE TIME,

00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:50,142
I'M ALWAYS COMING UP
WITH NEW PRODUCT IDEAS.

00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,144
MY PRODUCT
IS A DEVICE FOR THE HOME,

00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,747
AND IT'S GONNA CHANGE THE WAY
AMERICANS START THEIR DAY.

00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,682
(beeping)

00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,820
ANNOYING ALARM CLOCKS ARE
A HORRIBLE WAY TO START THE DAY.

00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,155
SO I'VE CREATED SOMETHING
THAT'LL MAKE YOU

00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,358
ACTUALLY LOOK FORWARD
TO WAKING UP.
(sizzling)

00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,093
MY PRODUCT TAKES
A UNIQUE APPROACH

00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:09,662
ON WAKING UP IN THE MORNING.

00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:12,031
IT'S PRETTY MUCH
THE ONLY ONE OF ITS KIND.

00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,800
I'VE TAKEN MY PRODUCT
AS FAR AS I CAN ON MY OWN.

00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,470
I NEED THE EXPERTISE,
THE CONNECTIONS, AND THE MONEY

00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,473
THAT THE SHARKS HAVE TO HELP ME
GET THIS MASS PRODUCED.

00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:23,009
THAT WOULD BE
A DREAM COME TRUE OF MINE.

00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:26,012
♪♪♪

00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:38,090
HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS MATTY SALLIN,

00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,493
AND MY PRODUCT IS CALLED
WAKE N' BACON.

00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:41,694
(laughs)

00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:43,362
I'M ASKING FOR $40,000

00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:45,398
IN RETURN FOR 20% EQUITY.

00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,367
SO... WHILE I WAS GETTING
MY MASTER'S DEGREE

00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,102
AT N. Y. U. UNIVERSITY,

00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,605
I TOOK AN INTRODUCTORY
ELECTRONICS COURSE

00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:55,341
WHERE WE HAD TO MAKE
A DEVICE FOR THE HOME.

00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:57,910
AND I WANTED TO REMAKE
AN ALARM CLOCK.

00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,912
AND SO I CANVASSED
MY FELLOW STUDENTS,

00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:03,015
ASKING THEM WHAT THEIR IDEAL WAY
TO WAKE UP WAS.

00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,517
NOW I CAN'T SAY

00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:06,986
WHAT THE NUMBER ONE ANSWER WAS
ON TELEVISION...

00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:09,589
(laughs)
BUT THE CLOSE SECOND

00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:12,892
WAS THE SMELL
AND TASTE OF BACON.

00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:15,394
AND SO, INSPIRED,
I WENT HOME AND I BUILT

00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:17,063
THE WORLD'S FIRST ALARM CLOCK

00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:20,199
THAT ACTUALLY WAKES YOU UP
WITH BACON.

00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,968
(laughs)
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS‐‐

00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:24,470
SO THE NIGHT BEFORE,
YOU OPEN UP THE CHAMBER,

00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,740
AND YOU PUT IN A COUPLE
OF SLICES OF PRECOOKED BACON,

00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,142
AND THEN YOU SET THE ALARM
FOR SAY 7:00 A. M.

00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:33,813
THE NEXT MORNING AT 6:50,
THE CLOCK SILENTLY TURNS ON,

00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:36,816
AND IT HEATS UP THE BACON
TO A CRISP

00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:38,851
SO THAT THE SMELL
IS REALLY STRONG

00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,153
AND CAN WAKE UP
ANY BACON LOVER.
(laughs)

00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:43,589
YOU CAN THEN ACTUALLY
JUST ROLL OVER IN BED,

00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:47,193
OPEN IT UP,
AND EAT THE BACON YOURSELF.
YOU CAN COOK THE BACON
AND THEN EAT IT.

00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:49,261
THAT'S RIGHT.
<i>SHUT UP.</i>

00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:53,065
I'M SERIOUS. I BUILT THIS,
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS A LARK,

00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:55,901
SO I POSTED IT ON MY WEB SITE,
AND WAKE N' BACON WENT VIRAL.

00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:58,170
I'VE BEEN INUNDATED WITH
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF E‐MAILS

00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,073
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE BEGGING ME
TO SELL THEM ONE.

00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:03,075
AND SO WITH THE MONEY
I'M ASKING FOR,

00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:05,077
I WANT TO REDESIGN THIS
FOR MASS PRODUCTION

00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,979
AND GET A FUNCTIONAL PROTOTYPE

00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,982
SO THAT I CAN GO PITCH THIS
TO RETAIL PARTNERS

00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,084
AND MANUFACTURING PARTNERS
AND INVESTORS.

00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,854
I'VE ACTUALLY GOT
AN ARTIST RENDERING

00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:17,256
OF WHAT IT COULD LOOK LIKE
IF MASS PRODUCED.

00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:19,825
NOTICE THE HOOVES.

00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:23,029
AND THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
WITH THE TRAY OPEN.

00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:25,031
AND THE CORD
IS A LITTLE CORKSCREW.

00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:27,166
I THOUGHT OF EVERYTHING.
(laughs)

00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,735
CAN WE TRY IT?
DO YOU HAVE ANY‐‐
OH, ABSOLUTELY.

00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:33,039
IN FACT, UM, I'VE GOT
SOME FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,642
HEY, MATTY, I‐I LOVE
THE FACE OF THE PIG.

00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:40,012
DO YOU HAVE A SLOGAN FOR THIS
OR ANYTHING?
RISE AND SWINE.

00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,481
(sharks laugh)
OH, LORDY.

00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:45,051
(laughs)
MATTY, HOW LONG
DOES IT TAKE TO COOK?

00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:47,053
UH, IT TAKES TEN MINUTES
TO REHEAT.

00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:49,689
SO, MATTY, WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
WE'VE SOLD 10,000 OF THESE,

00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,992
AND THE TEN THOUSAND AND FIRST
CATCHES ON FIRE

00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:58,497
AND BURNS A COUPLE
TO DEATH IN THEIR BED?

00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:01,534
WELL, IT NEEDS‐‐IT‐‐
IT HAS TO BE U. L. LISTED,

00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,569
WHICH MEANS IT'S SAFE
FOR THE HOME,

00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:06,572
FOR ANY ELECTRONICS DEVICE.
YEAH, BUT I'M GONNA ASK YOU‐‐
YOU THINK THEY WANT AN OVEN

00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:08,574
COOKING BACON
NEXT TO A BED?

00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:11,177
WELL, YOU KNOW, THERE'S
THE EASY‐BAKE OVEN OUT THERE‐‐

00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:14,547
BUT NOT NEXT TO SOMEBODY'S BED
AT 2:00 IN THE MORNING.
YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE A KID'S
GONNA PUT THE EASY‐BAKE OVEN.

00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,282
IF THEY‐‐IF THEY MADE IT
THROUGH THAT,

00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:18,317
THEN I'M SURE
THAT I CAN FIND A WAY

00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,653
TO GET THIS U. L. LISTED
AND SAFE FOR THE HOME.

00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:22,822
THIS IS FANTASTIC.
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
OF PRICING?

00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:24,590
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOUR MARGINS WILL BE?

00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,592
SO IT'D BE
ABOUT $13 PER UNIT.

00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,594
I MEAN,
YOU'RE ASKING FOR $40,000.

00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,629
SO ONCE YOU BURN THROUGH
THE $40,000

00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,898
TO MAKE THE PROTOTYPE,

00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,768
WHERE'S THE MONEY GONNA COME
FROM TO SELL IT?

00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:38,270
I WANT THE MONEY SO THAT
I CAN THEN PITCH THIS

00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,339
TO RETAIL PARTNERS
AND MANUFACTURING PARTNERS.

00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:42,575
(Mark) MATTY, LET ME SEE
IF I GET THIS RIGHT.

00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:45,277
THIS IS A NOVELTY ITEM.
YES.

00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:48,280
YOU THINK YOU CAN SELL
HOW MANY UNITS?
I'M NOT SURE‐‐
I DON'T HAVE A PROJECTION

00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,484
OF HOW MANY UNITS
I COULD SELL.

00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:53,919
AT LEAST THROW OUT A FORECAST.

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,756
SAY 1.26 MILLION
IN THE FIRST QUARTER.

00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:59,925
EVEN IF YOU'RE LYING TO ME,
AT LEAST THAT'S INTERESTING.

00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,228
YOU GOT NO PROJECTIONS
WHATSOEVER.

00:21:02,228 --> 00:21:05,231
YOU GOT A PIG BOX THAT'S GONNA
CATCH ON FIRE AND KILL SOMEBODY.

00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:07,833
I'M GONNA BE SUED
INTO THE STONE AGE.

00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:11,337
I'M OUT, BUT I'LL GIVE YOU
100 BUCKS FOR THE PIG BOX.
IS THE PIG BOX FOR SALE?

00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:14,006
UH, NO.
IT'S THE ONLY ONE I HAVE.

00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:16,642
(Daymond laughs)
MATTY, I THINK YOUR IDEA
IS WHIMSICAL,

00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:19,445
AND IT'S A GREAT NOVELTY GIFT.
THANK YOU.

00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:22,882
THAT'S MY COMPLIMENT. I DON'T
THINK ANYONE REALLY WANTS

00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:25,284
TO HAVE BACON THAT CLOSE
WHEN THEY'RE WAKING UP.

00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,286
I THINK THEY LIKE SMELLING IT
IN THE KITCHEN,

00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,289
THAT MOM'S MAKING,
SO I'M OUT.
ALL RIGHT.

00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,759
I'M TAKING MY PIECE OF BACON
AND I'M OUT.
ALL RIGHT.

00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,462
I LIKE PIG‐‐
I LIKE BACON.

00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,597
(laughs)

00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:42,201
GET ON IT. IN OR OUT?

00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:46,138
I'M OUT.
ALL RIGHT.

00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,140
LET ME ASK YOU THIS, MATTY.

00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,743
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE MINIMUM PRODUCTION RUN IS?

00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:53,813
UM, I THINK IT'S‐‐10,000
IS THE LOWEST I COULD GO.

00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:56,315
SO THAT MEANS
IF YOUR FULL COST FOR THESE

00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,651
IS 15 BUCKS A UNIT BASICALLY?

00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,520
13 BUCKS A UNIT,
SO IT'D BE $130,000.

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,957
WHERE IS THAT MONEY
COMING FROM?

00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:07,393
THAT'S WHERE I NEED TO PARTNER
WITH A RETAIL PARTNER

00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:09,595
OR A MANUFACTURING PARTNER
OR AN INVESTOR.

00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:12,264
YOU NEEDED TO KNOW‐‐
MARK, YOU'RE NOT GONNA PUT
YOUR NAME ON THIS, 'CAUSE I'M

00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:15,601
GONNA SUE YOU INTO THE STONE AGE
AFTER MY BED CATCHES ON FIRE.

00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:18,604
I KNOW HOW TO BUY INSURANCE,
SO WE CAN DEAL WITH THAT.

00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:20,606
THE BIGGER PROBLEM
THAT I HAVE LITERALLY‐‐

00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:26,011
AND BEING VERY INTERESTED‐‐
IS, YOU NEEDED $170,000.

00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,880
YOU ONLY ASKED FOR $40,000.

00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:34,787
I'M NOW ASKING FOR $170,000.

00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:38,057

00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:40,993
MARK, ARE YOU REALLY
INTERESTED IN THIS?
I LIKE THE IDEA.

00:22:40,993 --> 00:22:43,662
YOU REALLY THINK COOKING BACON
BEDSIDE IS A GOOD IDEA?

00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:45,164
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:48,834
'CAUSE IF I HAD TO GUESS,
THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE

00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:51,303
WHO WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE BACON,
I'D SAY 10%.

00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:53,305
AND IF HAD TO GUESS
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,941
WHO WOULD MAKE BACON TWICE,
I'D SAY 0%.

00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:57,943
HOW MANY PERCENT
SET THE HOUSE ON FIRE?

00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:00,579
WELL, THAT'S WHAT I'M‐‐
THE POINT, THOUGH, IS,

00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,581
THEY'RE NOT GONNA USE IT
TO MAKE BACON.

00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:06,385

IT'S A GAG GIFT.

00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:13,692
THE PROBLEM IS, I'M NOT GONNA
PUT UP THE $130,000.

00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,594
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,399
BECAUSE OF THAT, MATTY,
I'M OUT.

CHILDREN BY DOING THAT.

THAT WAS AWESOME.

00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:46,452
HEY, GUYS.
MY NAME IS BRIAN SPENCER.

00:24:46,452 --> 00:24:48,454
I'M THE FOUNDER
AND CHIEF TEST PILOT

00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:50,055
FOR VURTEGO POGO STICKS.

00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:53,225
AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR
IS A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS

00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:55,160
FOR 20% OF THE COMPANY.

00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:59,865
ALL THESE KIDS AND ADULTS
THAT PARTICIPATE IN THINGS

00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:02,067
LIKE BMX AND‐‐AND MOTOCROSS
AND STUFF LIKE THAT,

00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:04,103
THEY'RE ALWAYS LOOKING
FOR THE NEXT BIG THING,

00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:06,605
THE NEXT SORT OF EVOLUTION
OF ACTION SPORTS.

00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:08,507
THIS COULD BE THAT THING.

00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,743
WE'RE GONNA SHOW YOU
A VIDEO RIGHT HERE

00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:12,778
OF SOME OF THE STUFF KIDS ARE
DOING AROUND THE WORLD ALREADY.

00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:14,780
BY THE WAY,
DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME.

00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,683
UH, IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT,
UH, YOU SHOULD DO

00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:18,684
UNLESS YOU'RE PROFESSIONALS
LIKE THESE GUYS.

00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,386

00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,760
OH, THAT IS SO COOL.

00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,429
ESSENTIALLY, WHAT WE'VE DONE
IS REINVENTED THE POGO STICK.

00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:33,265
HOW MANY HAVE YOU SOLD?
UH, WE'VE SOLD ABOUT 7,000.

00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:36,702
NOBODY'S INJURED THEMSELVES?
HEY, YOU KNOW, SKATEBOARDS‐‐
PEOPLE GET HURT ON SKATEBOARDS.

00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,737
THESE ARE, UH,
DECEPTIVELY SAFE.

00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:41,573
AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE, UM,
YOU'RE NOT DEALING WITH SPEED.

00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:45,110
YOU'RE DEALING WITH
JUST GOING UP AND DOWN.

00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,646
AND WHAT'S THE TYPICAL
RETAIL PRICE?
$330.

00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:50,849
WHAT'S IT COST TO MAKE IT?
COST ABOUT 100 BUCKS.

00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:54,453
OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S OTHER
POGO STICKS.
THERE IS A COMPETITOR THAT,
UH, USES RUBBER BANDS.

00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:56,889
THE BIGGEST POGO STICK COMPANY
IN THE WORLD, BY THE WAY.

00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,757
THEY SELL MILLIONS
OF POGO STICKS EVERY YEAR.

00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:00,492
WE PLAN ON REPLACING THEM

00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:02,895
AS THE WORLD'S LARGEST
POGO STICK MANUFACTURER.

00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:05,230
(Robert)
IS THIS A MASS‐MARKET PRODUCT,

00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,232
OR COULD YOU CONTINUE DOING
WHAT YOU'RE DOING,

00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,501
SELLING 300,000 TO 400,000
A YEAR,

00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:11,503
BUT MAKING SPECIALIZED,
MORE EXP‐‐

00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:14,006
'CAUSE HONESTLY, WHEN YOU
TOLD ME IT WAS ONLY $300,

00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:16,408
AS A SPECIALTY PRODUCT,
THAT SEEMED CHEAP TO ME.

00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,944
THE SAME REASON
WHY MOST KIDS DON'T BUY

00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:20,446
A $5,000 MOUNTAIN BIKE‐‐

00:26:20,446 --> 00:26:22,714
YOU KNOW, THEIR PARENTS BUY 'EM
A $500 BMX BIKE.

00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:24,883
UM, IN ORDER TO MAKE MONEY
WITH THIS,

00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:27,386
WE DO HAVE TO APPROACH
THE MASSES.

00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:29,888
WHY DON'T YOU STAY
IN THAT SPACE, OWN IT,

00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:32,991
MAKE FANTASTIC MARGINS...
WE'RE GONNA DO BOTH.

00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:35,661

WE'RE GONNA DO BOTH.

I MEAN, A STRATEGY
WHERE YOU WANT TO GO COMPETE

00:26:37,663 --> 00:26:39,998
AND SELL IT IN TOY STORES
AND HAVE MASS DISTRIBUTION‐‐

00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:42,835
IT'S A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT BUSINESS.
(Mark) LOOK,
I'LL JUST TELL YOU,

YOU CAN BE A VICTIM
OF YOUR OWN SUCCESS.

00:26:44,503 --> 00:26:47,239

WHEN YOU'RE COOL AND HIP,

00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:50,309
I BRING YOU DOWN
TO A MAVS GAME‐‐
WE ALREADY ARE COOL AND HIP.

00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:51,977
RIGHT.
SEE, THAT'S THE POINT.

00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:55,481
WHEN YOU GO MASS MARKET,
YOU LOOSE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT.

00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:57,249
TO BE ABLE
TO MAINTAIN YOUR COOLNESS

00:26:57,249 --> 00:26:59,785
AND SEGREGATE INTO AN ENTIRE
DIFFERENT TYPE OF COMPANY

00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,520
THAT GOES MASS MARKET,

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,624
AND TO DO IT WITH,
YOU KNOW, $500,000 ONLY,

00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,593
THAT'S NOT AN EASY TASK.

00:27:07,593 --> 00:27:10,262
LISTEN, YOU'VE GOT BILLIONS
OF DOLLARS OF INVESTORS

00:27:10,262 --> 00:27:12,264
ON THIS SIDE OF THESE TABLES.

00:27:12,264 --> 00:27:14,733
EVERYBODY'S IN SYNC
ON THE SAME PLACE.

00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:16,768
THEY DON'T SEE YOUR VISION
FOR THE LOW END.

00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:19,571
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
DON'T YOU SEE IT?
AS I'M‐‐AS I'M LISTENING
TO YOU GUYS,

00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:22,841
UH, I‐I‐I AGREE.
IT'S HARD NOT TO AGREE.
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I WANT TO SEE.

00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:25,878
I WANT TO SEE THE PRICE
OF THESE THINGS GO UP BY 100%.

00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:28,147
THEY'RE $600 NOW.

GO MASS MARKET," BUT‐‐
NO, YOU DON'T.

YOU TRY TO PLEASE EVERYBODY,

TO CRUSH THE POGO GUYS.

I JUST WANT TO MAKE MONEY.

YOU SHOULD GET OUT THERE,
BRING OUT THE BOOST AT $1,200,

SELL THEIR SISTER TO BUY IT,

AN OBSCENE PROFIT.

00:32:24,662 --> 00:32:26,931
AND AS YOU BREATHE OUT,
IT FLUSHES ITSELF.

00:32:26,931 --> 00:32:29,567
DOES IT STOP VIRUSES,
BACTERIAL IN‐‐
IT DOES.

00:32:29,567 --> 00:32:32,603
WHAT'S TO STOP YOU FROM TAKING
THE GERMS IN THROUGH YOUR MOUTH?

00:32:32,603 --> 00:32:34,639
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.

00:32:34,639 --> 00:32:37,275
90% OF THE AIR WE BREATHE
GOES THROUGH OUR NASAL PASSAGES.

00:32:37,275 --> 00:32:40,578
ALSO, VIRUSES DO NOT GROW
IN THE MOUTH, THE ESOPHAGUS,

00:32:40,578 --> 00:32:43,881
OR LINING OF THE STOMACH.
THEY GROW IN THE NASAL PASSAGE.
IS THERE A PATENT
THAT PROTECTS THIS?

00:32:43,881 --> 00:32:46,150
YES, SIR. I HAVE‐‐
WHAT'S PATENTED?

00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:48,453
UH, WE HAVE A PATENT PENDING
IN THE UNITED STATES,

00:32:48,453 --> 00:32:51,289
CANADA AND EUROPE,
AND HAVE BEEN FOR THREE YEARS.
AND WHAT WOULD YOU USE
THE MONEY FOR?

00:32:51,289 --> 00:32:54,058
THE MONEY FOR RIGHT NOW IS
SO THAT I CAN KEEP PRODUCING IT

00:32:54,058 --> 00:32:56,561
BECAUSE OF THE RAW MATERIALS
I HAVE TO BUY UPFRONT.

00:32:56,561 --> 00:32:58,729
SO BASICALLY,
YOU NEED THE $500,000

00:32:58,729 --> 00:33:00,932
TO MAKE THE ORDER.
CORRECT.

00:33:00,932 --> 00:33:03,668
OKAY, TELL ME IF I'M
PUTTING THESE IN RIGHT.

00:33:03,668 --> 00:33:06,370
SO I JUST TAKE IT‐‐
THE BEST WAY TO DO IT‐‐PUT IT
ON YOUR FINGER LIKE A CONTACT,

00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:08,873
TOUCH YOUR NASAL PASSAGE,
SLIDE IT AROUND ON THE OUTSIDE,

00:33:08,873 --> 00:33:12,477
SLIDE IT ON THE INSIDE.
(Robert) JOE,
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

00:33:12,477 --> 00:33:15,346
WHY NOT JUST GO LICENSE IT TO
ONE OF THE BIG DRUG COMPANIES?

00:33:15,346 --> 00:33:18,082
UM, BECAUSE I‐I DID THAT
ORIGINALLY.

00:33:18,082 --> 00:33:20,084
I WENT TO ONE OF THE BIGGEST
IN THE UNITED STATES,

00:33:20,084 --> 00:33:22,487
AND THEY TOLD ME
WE WERE ACTUALLY A COMPETITOR,

00:33:22,487 --> 00:33:24,789
AND IF THEY TOOK THE PRODUCT,
THEY WOULD SHELVE IT.

00:33:24,789 --> 00:33:26,791
BECAUSE WHY WOULD THEY
PREVENT IT FOR $1

00:33:26,791 --> 00:33:29,961
WHEN THEY COULD TREAT IT
FOR $14?
HOW MUCH MONEY
HAVE YOU PUT INTO THIS?

00:33:29,961 --> 00:33:32,630
WE HAVE ALMOST A MIL‐‐
$1 MILLION INTO THIS PRODUCT.
AND WHERE'D THAT MONEY
COME FROM?

00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,632
UM, ABOUT $600,000 OF IT
WAS MINE,

00:33:34,632 --> 00:33:36,701
AND THE REST IS FROM FRIENDS
AND FAMILY.

00:33:36,701 --> 00:33:38,803
I THINK I'D HAVE A VERY HARD
TIME UNDERSTANDING AT ALL

00:33:38,803 --> 00:33:40,304
WHAT THE PRODUCT IS ABOUT

00:33:40,304 --> 00:33:42,640
UNLESS YOU HAD THESE BIG PHOTOS
WITH THE NOSES

00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,275
AND UNLESS YOU'RE STANDING THERE
PITCHING IT,

00:33:44,275 --> 00:33:46,544
BECAUSE I THINK THE COST
OF EDUCATING PEOPLE

00:33:46,544 --> 00:33:49,013
IS THE BIG KAHUNA HERE.

00:33:49,013 --> 00:33:51,282
JOE, BASED ON THAT,
I'M OUT.

00:33:51,282 --> 00:33:54,685
OKAY.

00:33:54,685 --> 00:33:57,421
I'M INTRIGUED,
I GOTTA TELL YA.

00:33:57,421 --> 00:33:59,390
LET ME THROW
AN OFFER OUT TO YOU.

00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:02,693
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $500,000,
AND I WANT A 15% ROYALTY

00:34:02,693 --> 00:34:08,266
ON EVERY UNIT SOLD
UNTIL I RECOUP MY $500,000.

00:34:08,266 --> 00:34:11,002
OKAY, JUST THE ROYALTY,
NO EQUITY?
ARE YOU KIDDING?

00:34:11,002 --> 00:34:13,471
OF COURSE I WANT THE EQUITY.
I TOOK THE RISK.

00:34:13,471 --> 00:34:15,806
NOW HERE'S MY EQUITY‐‐
I WANT 20%.

00:34:18,876 --> 00:34:21,779
YOU HAVE AN OFFER FROM ME.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

00:34:21,779 --> 00:34:24,482
I WOULD DEFINITELY LIKE TO HEAR
WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE HAS TO SAY

00:34:24,482 --> 00:34:26,984
BEFORE I WOULD EVEN CONSIDER‐‐
THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED.
THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED.

00:34:26,984 --> 00:34:29,854
THEY NEVER TOLD ME
THEY WERE OUT.
BECAUSE OF THEIR SILENCE,
YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED.

00:34:29,854 --> 00:34:32,857
NOT NECESSARILY TRUE.
NOT NECESSARILY TRUE.

00:34:32,857 --> 00:34:35,326
WE CAN WORK TOGETHER
ON THIS.

00:34:37,228 --> 00:34:39,497
HMM.

00:34:43,634 --> 00:34:45,603
OKAY, YOU GOT A DEAL.
YEAH.

00:34:45,603 --> 00:34:48,673
I LIKE THAT.

00:34:50,575 --> 00:34:53,211
I LIKE HOW CUDDLY THEY ARE,
BUT I WANT TO GIVE YOU

00:34:53,211 --> 00:34:55,613
$800,000 FOR 30%...

00:34:55,613 --> 00:34:59,984
WITH 10% ROYALTY.

00:34:59,984 --> 00:35:02,153
OH, COME ON.

00:35:02,153 --> 00:35:03,654

00:35:03,654 --> 00:35:06,991

I REALLY DO,

00:35:11,629 --> 00:35:14,799
BUT, UM, I WOULD DEFINITELY‐‐
YOU JUST TURNED DOWN
$1 MILLION.

00:35:14,799 --> 00:35:18,536
YES, SIR. I‐I‐I COULDN'T TAKE
$1 MILLION.

00:35:18,536 --> 00:35:21,305
I KNOW THAT THIS IS
A BILLION‐DOLLAR INDUSTRY.

00:35:21,305 --> 00:35:23,608
IS THERE A NUMBER
YOU WOULD TAKE...

00:35:23,608 --> 00:35:25,476
TO SELL THE WHOLE COMPANY?

00:35:25,476 --> 00:35:28,045
ONE CHECK.
NOT, UH,
WITHOUT A ROYALTY? NO.

00:35:28,045 --> 00:35:30,581
WITH A ROYALTY?
VERY POSSIBLY, YES.
WHAT'S THE ROYALTY?

00:35:30,581 --> 00:35:32,583
I BELIEVE THAT
WITH THE STATISTICS

00:35:32,583 --> 00:35:34,285
AND THE RESEARCH WE'VE DONE,

00:35:34,285 --> 00:35:37,321
THE ROYALTY
WOULD HAVE TO BE 10%.
WHOA.

00:35:37,321 --> 00:35:40,658
AND THEN WHAT'S THE NUMBER
ON THE COMPANY?
I WOULD LIKE TO STAY A PART
OF IT, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,

00:35:40,658 --> 00:35:44,795
BECAUSE IT'S MY PASSION. I, UM,
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU SOMETHING.
NO, I DON'T WANNA SEE.

00:35:44,795 --> 00:35:47,431
I AM A CANCER‐‐I AM A CANC‐‐
I AM A CANCER SURVIVOR.
OH.

00:35:47,431 --> 00:35:49,734
I'M A CANCER SURVIVOR.
BY THE TIME I WAS 19 YEARS OLD,

00:35:49,734 --> 00:35:52,670
I'D BEEN THROUGH THE ARMY, I'D
BEEN THROUGH THE MARINE CORPS,

I'D BEEN HALFWAY AROUND

I FOUGHT ALL MY LIFE
IN DOING DIFFERENT THINGS.

00:35:57,341 --> 00:35:59,844
I BELIEVE IN THIS
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE

00:35:59,844 --> 00:36:02,647
BECAUSE I'VE GOTTEN TESTIMONIALS
FROM PEOPLE SAYING,

00:36:02,647 --> 00:36:07,018
"YOU'VE CHANGED MY LIFE, YOU'VE
CHANGED THE QUALITY OF MY LIFE."
I'LL GIVE YOU $1 MILLION.
I WANT 30% OF THE COMPANY

00:36:07,018 --> 00:36:10,187
ALSO 10% ROYALTY
UNTIL I RECOUP THE MONEY.

WE'RE ABOUT TO MAKE YOU
A MILLIONAIRE, JUST LIKE THAT.

I'D LIKE TO HAVE 'EM A LITTLE
BIT MORE CLEAR IF I CAN.

IS THE SAME THING.

00:41:06,563 --> 00:41:08,799
THAT'S OUR OFFER.

00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:12,869
UM, I WOULD CONSIDER
YOUR OFFER.

00:41:12,869 --> 00:41:14,971
I WOULD‐‐THE ONLY THING
I WOULD ASK YOU TO DO

00:41:14,971 --> 00:41:18,074
IS IF YOU'D GO TO $1.2 MILLION,
FOR THE SIMPLE REASON

00:41:18,074 --> 00:41:20,710
THAT WILL GIVE ME ENOUGH
TO FILL MY FIRST ORDER.
WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT

00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,712
BECAUSE IF WE OWN A PIECE
OF THE COMPANY,

00:41:22,712 --> 00:41:25,148
WE'RE YOUR PARTNERS,
THEN WE HAVE TO FINANCE YOU.

00:41:25,148 --> 00:41:29,286
BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO PAY
FOR IT RIGHT NOW.
IF YOU NEED MORE MONEY TO FUND
NEW ORDERS AND GROW THE COMPANY,

00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:31,288
YOU THINK WE'RE GONNA LET
OUR EQUITY DISAPPEAR

00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:35,258
BECAUSE WE COULDN'T FUND
A NEW ORDER? OF COURSE NOT.

00:41:35,258 --> 00:41:39,496
SO YOU GET US WITHOUT GIVING UP
ANY MORE EQUITY WITH THIS DEAL.

00:41:39,496 --> 00:41:41,465
DON'T SELL YOURSELF SHORT.

00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:43,767
JOE, LISTEN...
JOE, YOU GOTTA SAY
YES OR NO.

00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:45,769
THIS‐‐LIFE IS LIKE BUSINESS,

00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:49,105
IT'S 20% WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU
AND 80% HOW YOU RESPOND.

00:41:49,105 --> 00:41:51,107
YOU HAVE A MOMENT RIGHT NOW

00:41:51,107 --> 00:41:53,310
TO TAKE THIS DEAL.

00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:56,413
WILL YOU TAKE IT?

00:41:58,014 --> 00:42:00,951
DOES IT COME
WITH SEASON TICKETS?
ABSOLUTELY.

00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:03,086
THEN YOU GOT A DEAL.
(Daymond) AMEN.

00:42:03,086 --> 00:42:04,955
(laughing)

00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:06,323
CONGRATULATIONS.

00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:08,558
THANK YOU.
CONGRATULATIONS.

00:42:08,558 --> 00:42:11,194
CONGRATULATIONS.
REALLY GREAT JOB.
APPRECIATE IT. I'M LOOKING
FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER.

00:42:11,194 --> 00:42:13,230
(Mark) ABSOLUTELY.
(Robert) GOOD JOB, JOE.

00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:16,433
THANK YOU.
PLEASURE MEETING YOU.
(Barbara) DID YOU GIVE HIM
THE SEASON TICKETS?

00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:18,768
THINK ABOUT THAT. THAT'S
REMARKABLE. I JUST OFFERED A GUY

00:42:18,768 --> 00:42:21,771
$4 MILLION, WHICH IS ABOUT
AS HIGH AS I WAS GONNA GO‐‐
BUT THAT'S THE BEAUTY
OF THIS SHOW.

00:42:21,771 --> 00:42:23,807
THIS GUY WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE
WALKED IN

00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:26,343
AND HAD THE CHOICE
TO BE A MILLIONAIRE...
AND HE STUCK WITH IT.

00:42:26,343 --> 00:42:28,645
AND HE STUCK TO HIS GUNS
AND HE BELIEVED IN HIMSELF.

00:42:28,645 --> 00:42:32,249
THAT'S WHAT MAKES
THIS COUNTRY GREAT.
I FEEL WARM AND FUZZY.
I JUST MADE SOME MONEY.

00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:34,784
I WOULD HAVE TO SAY,
TO TURN DOWN $4 MILLION

00:42:34,784 --> 00:42:37,787
WAS PROBABLY SOMETHING
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY I DID.

00:42:37,787 --> 00:42:39,789
IT WAS SOMETHING
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D DO.

00:42:39,789 --> 00:42:42,792
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

00:42:42,792 --> 00:42:45,295
I STILL GOT THREE‐QUARTERS
OF A MILLION DOLLARS,

00:42:45,295 --> 00:42:46,963
AND I STILL OWN 70%

00:42:46,963 --> 00:42:50,600
OF THE NEXT BIGGEST THING
THAT THIS WORLD'S EVER SEEN.
