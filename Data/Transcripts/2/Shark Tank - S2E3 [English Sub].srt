IT BACK COULD BE FOREVER...

I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $90,000 FOR 33%,

00:08:50,262 --> 00:08:53,232
AND HERE'S WHY
I'M A BETTER PARTNER

00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:55,234
AND WHY I UNDERSTAND
SMALL BUSINESS.

00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:58,404
YOU CAN'T PAY A ROYALTY
WHEN YOU'RE STARTING OUT.

00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:00,940
A SMALL BUSINESS NEEDS
TO REINVEST THE CASH.

00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,441
I WANT A ROYALTY,

00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:05,411
BUT ONLY IF WE GET ABOVE
A CERTAIN AMOUNT IN SALES.

00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:08,481
ONCE THE BUSINESS IS HEALTHY,
MAYBE ONCE WE GET

00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,249
ABOUT A HALF A MILLION IN SALES,

00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:13,085
THEN WE'LL SIT DOWN
AND LOOK AT A ROYALTY.

00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:16,188
THAT POINT IS EXACTLY WHY
MR. O'LEARY DOESN'T UNDERSTAND

00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:18,524
HOW SMALL BUSINESSES WORK.
OKAY.

00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:20,526
YOU KNOW, THAT'S INTERESTING
TO HEAR THAT,

00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,995

DONE THIS BEFORE...

00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:24,764

00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,901
NO, NO. I'VE BUILT DISTRIBUTION
ALL AROUND THE WORLD.

00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,670
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
YOUR CHALLENGES ARE.

00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,406
TRUST ME, YOU NEED SOMEBODY
WHO KNOWS HOW TOUGH IT CAN BE,

00:09:34,406 --> 00:09:37,176
NOT JUST HOW EASY IT IS.
YOU NEED A GUY LIKE ME.

00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:39,178
THAT 7 1/2% ROYALTY
IS THE DISCIPLINE

00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:41,981
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO HAVE.

00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,983

STACY, LET'S ASK THE INFOMERCIAL
KING. INFOMERCIAL KING?

00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,049
YOU KNOW, THE PROBLEM I HAVE...
YOU MADE A LOT OF PROMISES HERE.

00:17:03,049 --> 00:17:10,128
YOU S‐‐YOU TALK ABOUT
ABS, BACK, THIGHS...
MM‐HMM...
MM‐HMM... MM‐HMM.

00:17:10,128 --> 00:17:13,866
YOU KNOW‐‐
AND PEACE
IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,134
YOU KNOW, I ONLY GOT
A BURN IN THE LEGS HERE.

00:17:16,134 --> 00:17:19,104
I DIDN'T‐‐I DON'T SEE IT
AS A TOTAL BODY‐‐
LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION.

00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:22,341
WHEN YOU WALK OR RUN, WHAT PART
OF YOUR BODY DOES THAT AFFECT?

00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:25,344
YOUR ENTIRE BODY. 'CAUSE YOU'RE
NOT GONNA TAKE OFF YOUR ARM

00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,846
AND LEAVE IT OVER
IN THE CORNER.
(laughs)

00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:30,849
I LOVE THAT.
SO DO YOU HAVE, LIKE, ANY
"BEFORE" AND "AFTER" PICTURES

00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:34,386
OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE USED THIS
AND HAVE HAD ANY KIND

00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,922
OF MAGICAL TRANSFORMATION?
YES, I HAVE. YES, I DO.

00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:38,924
I HELPED A LADY
LOSE 150 POUNDS.

00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:41,593
SHE WORE IT UNDERNEATH HER
DRESS. NOBODY KNEW IT WAS THERE.

00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:43,061
ONE LADY?

00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:46,064
I CANNOT SEE KEVIN O'LEARY,
WHO DOESN'T EVEN GO TO THE GYM,

00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:51,370
GOING HOME, BUYING THESE BANDS,
STRAPPING THEM ON...

00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,372
I JUST CAN'T SEE
PEOPLE BUYING IT.
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,

00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,874
I'LL KICK YOUR ASS IN SQUASH
ANY TIME YOU WANT.

00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:58,510
HERE'S THE ISSUE‐‐
IT'S A MARKETING NIGHTMARE.

00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:02,548
SO FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.

00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:05,050
I HAVE NO IDEA
IF <i>THIS</i> WORKS OR NOT,

00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:08,053
BUT YOU NEED TO SPEND HUNDREDS
AND HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS

00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:11,290
OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS
TO GET OUT THERE.

00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,760
FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT, STACY.
OKAY.

00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,462
THIS YEAR, I'VE LOOKED
AT ABOUT 100 FITNESS PRODUCTS.

00:18:17,462 --> 00:18:19,131
MOST OF THEM HAVE

00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,967
SOME KIND OF REALLY BIG
TESTIMONIAL BASE...
RIGHT.

00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,468
"BEFORE" AND "AFTERS"...
RIGHT.

00:18:23,468 --> 00:18:27,205
AND I DON'T SEE THAT HERE
WITH THIS PRODUCT, SO I'M OUT.

00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:30,759
YOU JUST REALLY VALUATED
THE COMPANY TOO MUCH.

00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:34,296
THAT MAKES IT
TOO RICH OF A DEAL FOR ME,

00:18:34,296 --> 00:18:38,100
SO I'D HAVE TO BE OUT.

00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,470
WELL, STACY, I HAPPEN
TO LOVE YOUR HUSTLE.
AND YOUR TUSH.

00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:44,940
(chuckles)
YEAH. I HAVE TO ADMIT
THAT'S LOOKING GOOD, TOO.

00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,509
BUT I'M JUST NOT SOLD
ON YOUR PRODUCT,

00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:49,478
SO FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT...

00:18:49,478 --> 00:18:51,480
I UNDERSTAND.
BUT I'M SOLD ON <i>YOU.</i>

00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,515
(laughs)
AND I'M SOLD ON YOU, TOO.

00:18:53,515 --> 00:18:56,385
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. I GOT
TO TRY AND MAKE SOME MONEY NOW.

00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,253
PLEASE LEAVE.
(chuckles)

00:18:58,253 --> 00:19:02,057
I WOULDN'T TALK TO A BIG GUY
LIKE THAT, LIKE THAT.

00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:05,460
YEAH.
YEAH, I WOULDN'T
MESS WITH HIM.

00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,796
♪♪♪

00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,810

00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:24,379

<i>STARTED BY THE KIDS.</i>

00:19:32,688 --> 00:19:35,791
HELLO. MY NAME IS EMILY JOHNSON.
THIS IS MY HUSBAND ROBIN,

00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:38,126
AND THESE ARE OUR CHILDREN
ERIN, LACHLAN, AND JAKE.

00:19:38,126 --> 00:19:40,329
WE'RE HERE TO TELL YOU ABOUT
OUR NEW PRODUCT CALLED FLIPOUTZ.

00:19:40,329 --> 00:19:42,164
IT ALL STARTED THREE YEARS AGO
ON A LONG CAR TRIP.

00:19:42,164 --> 00:19:44,166
YOU KNOW HOW KIDS GET
ON A LONG CAR TRIP.

00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:47,102
AND IN AN EFFORT TO PROMOTE
A LITTLE PEACE IN THE BACKSEAT,

00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,104
I CHALLENGED THE KIDS
TO COME UP

00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,106
WITH THEIR VERSION
OF THE PERFECT TOY OR GAME.

00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,842
AND THIS IS WHAT RESULTED
FROM THAT DISCUSSION.

00:19:53,842 --> 00:19:55,911
THE KIDS' COMPANY
IS CALLED FLIPOUTZ,

00:19:55,911 --> 00:19:59,147
AND THEY ARE SEEKING
A $100,000 INVESTMENT

00:19:59,147 --> 00:20:01,750
IN EXCHANGE FOR A 20%
EQUITY STAKE IN THE COMPANY.

00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,786
HI, GUYS. I'M LACHLAN,
AND I'M GOING TO INTRODUCE YOU

00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:07,289
TO THE NEXT BIG THING
FOR KIDS OF ALL AGES‐‐

00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,191
FLIPOUTZ.

00:20:09,191 --> 00:20:11,260
FLIPOUTZ IS
A SILICONE BRACELET

00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,929
THAT HOLDS FIVE
PERSONALIZED COINS

00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:16,999
THAT KIDS WEAR, TRADE,
AND THEN TRACK ONLINE

00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:18,867
AT THE FLIPOUTZ WEB SITE.

00:20:18,867 --> 00:20:21,603
THANK YOU, LACHLAN.
YOU ARE WELCOME.

00:20:21,603 --> 00:20:24,273
I'M ERIN JOHNSON,
AND MY CONTRIBUTION

00:20:24,273 --> 00:20:26,174
TO THE PROJECT WAS
A LITTLE MORE ARTISTIC

00:20:26,174 --> 00:20:28,677
WITH THE NOTION
OF SELF‐EXPRESSION.

00:20:28,677 --> 00:20:33,282
EACH COIN HAS ITS OWN CUSTOMIZED
ARTWORK OR POSITIVE MESSAGE

00:20:33,282 --> 00:20:37,119
THAT'S MEANT TO REPRESENT
WHO YOU ARE OR YOUR INTERESTS,

00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:39,755
OR HOBBIES OR TRAITS. AND THEN
ON THE BACK OF EACH COIN

00:20:39,755 --> 00:20:43,725
IS A 10‐DIGIT CODE THAT ALLOWS
KIDS TO TRACK THEIR COIN ONLINE

00:20:43,725 --> 00:20:45,727
AS IT GETS TRADED
AROUND THE WORLD.

00:20:45,727 --> 00:20:49,998
I'M JAKE. I WANTED A TOY THAT
HAD A GAMING OR TRADING ASPECT.

00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,167
AND WE ACCOMPLISHED THIS
WITH THE FLIPOUTZ WEB SITE.

00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:55,237
THE FLIPOUTZ WEB SITE
WEB 2.0 COMMUNITY,

00:20:55,237 --> 00:20:59,608
WHERE KIDS CAN CREATE A PROFILE
PAGE, BLOG, CHAT WITH FRIENDS,

00:20:59,608 --> 00:21:01,810
GIVE AND RECEIVE STATUS UPDATES,
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY,

00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:04,346
NAME, DESCRIBE,
AND TRACK YOUR COINS ONLINE.

00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,448
HOW OLD ARE YOU, JAKE?
I AM 11.

00:21:06,448 --> 00:21:10,752
I'M AMAZED THAT YOU WERE ABLE
TO DO ANYTHING WITH YOUR SISTER.

00:21:10,752 --> 00:21:13,021
'CAUSE I HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS
AND THEY CAN'T GET ALONG

00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:16,258
FOR MORE THAN...
OH, WE HAVE OUR MOMENTS.
(laughs)

00:21:16,258 --> 00:21:18,393
DO YOU HAVE ANY SALES TODAY?
OH, YES.

00:21:18,393 --> 00:21:20,963
WELL, IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS‐‐
UH, WE'VE ONLY BEEN SELLING

00:21:20,963 --> 00:21:24,266
FOR SIX MONTHS‐‐BUT WE'VE MADE
ALMOST $20,000.

00:21:24,266 --> 00:21:27,869
YOU'VE MADE
OR YOU'VE SOLD $20,000?
SOLD $20,000.

00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:31,473
AND WHERE DID YOU SELL IT?
MAINLY OFF OF THE WEB SITE.

00:21:31,473 --> 00:21:35,744
BUT WE'RE ALSO
IN A FEW...
WE'RE ALSO PARTNERED WITH
A SALES/BUSINESS REPRESENTATIVE,

00:21:35,744 --> 00:21:37,913
AND, UM, A SOUVENIR
DISTRIBUTING COMPANY

00:21:37,913 --> 00:21:41,249
WHO PUTS IT IN, YOU KNOW,
THEME PARKS, AQUARIUMS, ZOOS,

00:21:41,249 --> 00:21:43,618
UM, HOPEFULLY, WE'LL BE IN
THE ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME

00:21:43,618 --> 00:21:45,921
VERY SOON.
SO WHAT DOES IT COST
TO MAKE THESE

00:21:45,921 --> 00:21:48,523
AND WHAT DO THEY SELL FOR?
THE BRACELET AND ONE COIN

00:21:48,523 --> 00:21:53,228
WE CAN MAKE FOR 69 CENTS.
THE BRACELET, RETAIL, IS $4.99.

00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,497
WELL, I THINK THE REAL
COMPETITION TODAY IS

00:21:55,497 --> 00:21:57,966
THOSE BANDS THAT YOU BUY,
YOU KNOW...
SILLY BANDZ.

00:21:57,966 --> 00:22:01,570
SILLY BANDZ. MY KIDS
GO NUTS FOR THOSE.
(Erin) THIS IS THE NEXT
SILLY BAND.

00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,405
RIGHT. NEXT BIG SILLY BANDZ.

00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:06,475
CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME,
WHY WOULD A KID TRADE THE COIN?

00:22:06,475 --> 00:22:09,811
DOES IT BECOME PERSONALIZED
IN SOME SENSE?
UM, YES.

00:22:09,811 --> 00:22:12,814
THE COIN HAS THE CODE ON
THE BACK, WHICH‐‐ON THE WEB SITE

00:22:12,814 --> 00:22:15,584
YOU CAN ENTER THAT CODE
AND THAT COIN WILL POP UP,

00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,420
NOW YOU CAN PERSONALIZE
THE COIN, WRITE SOMETHING

00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,456
ABOUT IT, AND THEN
ONCE YOU TRADE THE COIN,

00:22:21,456 --> 00:22:25,494
YOU KNOW, THAT PERSON IS GOING
TO GET THAT MESSAGE FIRST,

00:22:25,494 --> 00:22:27,896
AND THEN THEY CAN WRITE
SOMETHING ABOUT IT,

00:22:27,896 --> 00:22:30,665
AND THEN THEY CAN WRITE
SOMETHING...
SO YOU REALLY CREATE, LIKE,
A HISTORY WITH EACH COIN.

00:22:30,665 --> 00:22:34,236
YES.
ARE PEOPLE FOLLOWING THIS
NOW ONLINE?

00:22:34,236 --> 00:22:36,538
YES.
ABSOLUTELY.

00:22:36,538 --> 00:22:40,242
AND HOW DID YOU GET THOSE
PEOPLE TO FIND IT ONLINE?
UM, WE GAVE IT
TO OUR WHOLE SCHOOL,

00:22:40,242 --> 00:22:42,411
WHICH‐‐WE GO TO A SMALL‐‐
VERY SMALL SCHOOL.

00:22:42,411 --> 00:22:44,579
BUT WE ALSO LIVE IN
A COLLEGE TOWN.

00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:47,349
UM, THE COLLEGE KIDS LOVE IT,
SO...

00:22:47,349 --> 00:22:50,085
HOW MUCH MONEY HAVE YOU SPENT
UP UNTIL THIS POINT?

00:22:50,085 --> 00:22:53,822
UM,WELL, OBVIOUSLY, REALLY,
WEHAVEN'T SPENT ANYTHING.

00:22:53,822 --> 00:22:57,192
BUT OUR PARENTS' MONEY‐‐OUR
PARENTS HAVE INVESTED ABOUT

00:22:57,192 --> 00:23:00,128
$250,000 IN THIS SO FAR.

00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:02,064
WOW.
WOW.

00:23:02,064 --> 00:23:05,167
SO, ROBIN,
WHERE'D THE MONEY GO?
WEB SITE DEVELOPMENT
WAS EXPENSIVE

00:23:05,167 --> 00:23:07,436
AND PATENT ATTORNEYS
WERE EXPENSIVE.
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

00:23:07,436 --> 00:23:10,305
WE'VE EVER HAD CHILDREN
IN THE SHARK TANK, I GOTTA SAY.
(Johnsons laugh)

00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:13,708
AND SMART ONES AT THAT.
LET'S TALK TO THE PARENTS
FOR A SECOND.

00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:15,644
YOU‐‐YOU'VE SPENT $250,000.

00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,245
MM‐HMM.
THAT'S SERIOUS MONEY.

00:23:17,245 --> 00:23:18,747
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW
THIS WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL?

00:23:18,747 --> 00:23:20,949
I MEAN, THIS IS A‐‐
THIS IS REALLY A TCHOTCHKE.

00:23:20,949 --> 00:23:22,951
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE LIKE IT.

00:23:22,951 --> 00:23:25,587
THE TRACKING AND TRADING IS
WHAT‐‐WE HAVE A PATENT PENDING

00:23:25,587 --> 00:23:28,390
ON THE TRACKING/TRADING PROCESS.

00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,759
SO THAT'S THE KEY.

00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:33,128
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY
THE BRACELET AND THE COINS.

00:23:33,128 --> 00:23:36,731
WHA‐‐WHAT‐‐
WE CAN PUT THE CODE ON ANYTHING,
TO TRACK AND TRADE ANYTHING,

00:23:36,731 --> 00:23:41,903
AND WE'RE THE ONLY ONES
THAT CAN DO THAT.
SO CAN YOU EXPAND
ON THAT A LITTLE BIT?

00:23:41,903 --> 00:23:44,139
YOU CAN TRACK AND TRADE
ANYTHING RELATED TO KIDS?
ANYTHING. ANY TCHOTCHKE.
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ONE OF‐‐

00:23:44,139 --> 00:23:47,876
THAT'S A VERY VALUABLE PATENT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

00:23:47,876 --> 00:23:51,179
COULD YOU PUT THAT ON
BASEBALL CARDS, IF THEY WERE...
EXACTLY.

00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:54,983
I THINK THE PATENT
COULD BE WORTH MONEY

00:23:54,983 --> 00:23:57,486
OR MAYBE NOTHING AT ALL,

00:23:57,486 --> 00:24:00,789
BUT I THINK THE PROOF IS IN
THE APPLICATION OF THE PATENT,

00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:02,858
AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS
IS THE RIGHT APPLICATION,

00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,860
BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS
AN ENORMOUS MARKETING PLAY

00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,895
THAT'S GONNA TAKE
A TON OF MONEY‐‐

00:24:06,895 --> 00:24:09,898
MORE MONEY THAN YOU'RE GONNA
BE WILLING TO GIVE. I'M OUT.

00:24:15,437 --> 00:24:17,639
HEY, JAKE, YOU REMIND ME
OF MYSELF.

00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:19,774
I WAS A YOUNG ENTREPRENEUR
JUST LIKE YOURSELF.

00:24:19,774 --> 00:24:22,144
AND I'D LIKE TO COMMEND
THE WHOLE FAMILY

00:24:22,144 --> 00:24:24,579
FOR THIS ENTERPRISE.
BUT $100,000...

00:24:24,579 --> 00:24:26,848
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S ENOUGH.

00:24:26,848 --> 00:24:30,652
I THINK IT'S TOO RISKY
FOR ME, SO I'M OUT.

00:24:30,652 --> 00:24:32,821
CAN I ADD ONE THING?

00:24:32,821 --> 00:24:35,690
THERE‐‐WE HAD INTEREST
FROM ANOTHER COMPANY

00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:38,560
WHO WANTS TO MAKE‐‐WE DON'T HAVE
THE PURCHASE ORDER IN HAND‐‐

00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,462
WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF CLOSING
THIS PURCHASE ORDER.

00:24:40,462 --> 00:24:43,798
25 MILLION COINS
AND 2 TO 3 MILLION BRACELETS.

00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:47,102
WHO'S GONNA PAY
FOR THAT INVENTORY?

00:24:47,102 --> 00:24:50,138
THEY'RE GONNA PAY
FOR 30% OF IT UP FRONT.

00:24:54,509 --> 00:24:58,180
I WOULD COME IN
FOR $100,000 FOR 33%

00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:01,149
BECAUSE THINK THAT
WHAT YOU NEED

00:25:01,149 --> 00:25:03,351
IS THE EXPERTISE
TO HELP NAVIGATE ALL THIS,

00:25:03,351 --> 00:25:06,655
AS WELL AS DO
SOME PRODUCTION YOURSELVES.

00:25:06,655 --> 00:25:08,890
ANY PARTNER HAS TO HAVE
MASSIVE DISTRIBUTION

00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:11,860
SO YOU CAN PUT IT EVERYWHERE.
DAYMOND HAS SOME OF THAT

00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,229
DISTRIBUTION.
I DON'T KNOW, THOUGH,

00:25:14,229 --> 00:25:17,132
IF IT'S THE RIGHT KIND
OF DISTRIBUTION.
YEAH, BUT IT'S REALLY
NOT YOUR BUSINESS

00:25:17,132 --> 00:25:21,169
UNLESS YOU'RE GONNA
GIVE 'EM AN OFFER.

00:25:21,169 --> 00:25:24,005
GUYS, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
I HAVE AN OFFER ON THE TABLE.

00:25:24,005 --> 00:25:26,942
33%, $100,000,
CONTINGENT ON THE PATENT.

00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:33,081
WE'RE A TEAM, AND WE'D REALLY
LIKE TO SEE A TEAM HERE, TOO.
OH, YOU'D LIKE
MORE THAN ONE SHARK.

00:25:33,081 --> 00:25:35,217
(Robin) IF THAT'S POSSIBLE.
WELL, I COULD GO IN WITH ROBERT
ON THIS THING,

00:25:35,217 --> 00:25:37,919
WE'D BLOW DAYMOND OUT. WE DON'T
NEED HIM. WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,655
I DON'T EVEN
KNOW IF IT'S GONNA WORK...
WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT WORK.

00:25:40,655 --> 00:25:42,691
IT'S THE LITTLE DEVIL ON MY
SHOULDER SAYING, "DO THE DEAL!

00:25:42,691 --> 00:25:44,693
DO THE DEAL!"
AND THE OTHER ONE SAYS,

00:25:44,693 --> 00:25:47,329
WHAT ARE YOU NUTS? YOU KNOW,
BESIDES BEING MR. WONDERFUL,

00:25:47,329 --> 00:25:49,798
I'M ALSO MR. TOY.
I SOLD MY COMPANY TO MATTEL

00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,500
FOR OVER $4 BILLION.
I KNOW THOSE GUYS.

00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,438
YOU WANNA GO 50/50
AND GET RID OF DAYMOND?
I'LL GO IN WITH YOU.

00:25:56,438 --> 00:25:59,274
OKAY. LET'S‐‐WE'LL DO
THE SAME PERCENTAGE.

00:25:59,274 --> 00:26:02,244
BUT TWO SHARKS.
TWO SHARKS. YOU GET TWO.

00:26:02,244 --> 00:26:04,246
SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY?
SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY,

00:26:04,246 --> 00:26:06,314
AND THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEAL
WITH DAYMOND, WHICH IS ALWAYS‐‐

00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:09,050
THE PROBLEM IS, MY $100,000
NOW ONLY WANTS 25%.

00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,725
UGH. LISTEN, WOULD YOU EXCUSE US
FOR A MOMENT?

00:26:16,725 --> 00:26:18,560
TAKE THE FAMILY OUTSIDE.

00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,328
(Robin) YEAH.
(Lachlan) ALL RIGHT,
COME ON.

00:26:23,265 --> 00:26:26,134
WHY ARE WE COMPETING? ALL RIGHT,
I THINK WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO HERE

00:26:26,134 --> 00:26:28,637
IS THE THREE OF US ARE GONNA
GO IN A DEAL.
I WANT PART OF IT.

00:26:28,637 --> 00:26:31,373
YEAH.
I THINK YOU ASK
FOR A LITTLE MORE MONEY.

00:26:31,373 --> 00:26:33,341
ALTHOUGH YOU DON'T WANNA
BLOW IT COMPLETELY.

00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:36,144
WE HAVE THREE SHARKS ON BOARD.
WELL, THAT'S TRUE.

00:26:36,144 --> 00:26:38,613
WHAT IF THEY PULL THE OFFER
OFF THE TABLE, MAKE 'EM MAD?
YEAH. THEN YOU JUST
BLEW IT ALL.

00:26:38,613 --> 00:26:40,115
SHARKS DO BITE!

00:26:40,115 --> 00:26:43,084
THIS IS REALLY‐‐
THIS IS STRESSFUL.
IT'S YOUR FUTURE.

00:26:43,084 --> 00:26:45,153
I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU.
WHAT DO Y'ALL WANT TO DO?

00:26:51,226 --> 00:26:54,863
ALL RIGHT, SO LIKE YOUR FAMILY,
WE'VE COME TOGETHER ON THIS,

00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:58,233
BECAUSE IT'S BETTER
TO BE FRIENDS THAN ENEMIES.

00:26:58,233 --> 00:27:00,235
IN THE END,
IT'S ALL ABOUT MONEY.

00:27:00,235 --> 00:27:02,137
THAT'S HOW LIFE IS,
UNFORTUNATELY.

00:27:02,137 --> 00:27:04,673
BUT ONCE YOU EMBRACE THAT TRUTH,
WONDERFUL THINGS CAN HAPPEN.

00:27:04,673 --> 00:27:06,841
SO HERE IS THE OFFER.
THREE OF US ARE GONNA

00:27:06,841 --> 00:27:10,545

DAYMOND, MYSELF, ROBERT.

00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:14,849
WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU $100,000
FOR 33% OF THIS COMPANY.

00:27:14,849 --> 00:27:17,619
WE THINK IT'S A CRAPSHOOT. WE
DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

00:27:17,619 --> 00:27:21,323
BUT WE THINK THE REAL VALUE
IS IN THE PATENT.

00:27:21,323 --> 00:27:25,660
AND IN THAT AREA,
WE'RE GREAT PARTNERS.

00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,696
BECAUSE WE'VE ALL WORKED
IN THAT SPACE.

00:27:27,696 --> 00:27:29,197
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

00:27:29,197 --> 00:27:30,999
UM...

IT'S Y'ALL'S CALL.

UM, I THINK
WE'VE ALL AGREED

00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:38,807

YOU'RE NOT GONNA SPRAY ME,

00:30:55,169 --> 00:30:57,272
I HAVE A BOTTLE

URINE SMELLS ARE THE HARDEST
TO GET RID OF IN THE WORLD.

00:31:03,144 --> 00:31:06,481

A SPRAY OF AMMONIA ON A TISSUE.

AND I'LL LET YOU VERIFY
THAT IT SMELLS LIKE URINE.

IS COMING FROM.

00:31:17,258 --> 00:31:21,262
AND OUR LOGO ON OUR BOTTLE
ACTUALLY SHOWS YOU WHAT WE DO.

00:31:21,262 --> 00:31:23,998
WE BREAK APART THE MOLECULES

IT IS NOT PATENTED.

00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,092
OH.

00:31:51,092 --> 00:31:52,827
WHY ISN'T IT PATENTED?

00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:55,530
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING
THAT YOU HAVE TO DISCLOSE

00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:58,766
EVERYTHING ABOUT
WHAT YOU HAVE.

00:31:58,766 --> 00:32:00,735

00:32:00,735 --> 00:32:04,772
A LARGE CHEMICAL HOUSEHOLD
PRODUCTS COMPANY

00:32:04,772 --> 00:32:07,575
FROM CHANGING
ONE INSIGNIFICANT INGREDIENT

00:32:07,575 --> 00:32:09,077
AND STEALING WHAT I HAVE?

00:32:10,778 --> 00:32:13,748
WELL, WHAT SALES DO YOU HAVE?
I CAN TELL YOU TO DATE,

00:32:13,748 --> 00:32:19,887
I'VE SOLD ALMOST $3.2 MILLION
OF PURE AYRE.

00:32:19,887 --> 00:32:22,223
WOW. THAT'S REALLY EXCITING.

00:32:22,223 --> 00:32:26,060
WE'RE AVERAGING
ABOUT $19,000 A MONTH.

00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,795
SORRY. SORRY, JAMES.

00:32:27,795 --> 00:32:31,199
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOUR SALES
FOR <i>THIS</i> YEAR WERE $3.2 MILLION.

00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:34,335
NO, SINCE INCEPTION.
OH. WHO CARES ABOUT THAT?

00:32:34,335 --> 00:32:36,704
LAST YEAR WAS $315,000 SOLD‐‐

00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:39,040
WHAT WERE THEY THE YEAR BEFORE
THEY WERE $300,000?

00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,110
THAT'S KIND OF AN EXCITING,
UM... MOMENT TO DISCUSS

00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,112
BECAUSE THE YEAR BEFORE THAT,

00:32:44,112 --> 00:32:46,481
THEY WERE OVER HALF A MILLION.

00:32:46,481 --> 00:32:51,653
AND $160,000, $170,000 OF THAT
WAS TO WALGREENS NATIONWIDE‐‐

00:32:51,653 --> 00:32:53,588
6,000 STORES.

00:32:53,588 --> 00:32:55,590
SO WHY DID THE SALES GO DOWN?

00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,625
THAT DOESN'T SOUND
VERY EXCITING.

00:32:57,625 --> 00:33:01,229
IN MONTH TWO
OF US BEING ON THE SHELF,

00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,231
IT WAS MADE AWARE TO ME

00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:07,402
THAT A LARGE COMPETITOR
KNOWS I'M OUT THERE.

00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:12,807
AND WE WERE MYSTERIOUSLY
TERMINATED FROM WALGREENS.

00:33:12,807 --> 00:33:15,510
WHY DID THEY KICK YOU OUT?
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:18,413
YOUR COMPETITORS‐‐THEY DON'T
WANT THEIR BUSINESS GOING AWAY,

00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,815
AND THEY'RE GREAT PARTNERS WITH
WALGREENS AND EVERYBODY ELSE.

00:33:20,815 --> 00:33:23,251
AND THEY SAID IT'S TIME
TO SHUT YOU DOWN

00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,720
AND CRUSH YOU LIKE
THE COCKROACH YOU ARE.

00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,123
NOW YOU WANT ME TO GET IN BED
WITH YOU AND GET CRUSHED <i>AGAIN?</i>

00:33:29,123 --> 00:33:33,461
I HAD A C. E. O. THAT DID
THE BEST HE COULD,

00:33:33,461 --> 00:33:37,065
BUT AFTER
THE WALGREENS EPISODE,

00:33:37,065 --> 00:33:39,267
WE BROUGHT IN
A CONSULTING FIRM

00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:42,503
TO TEACH US HOW MUCH MONEY
YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE

00:33:42,503 --> 00:33:45,339
TO SUPPORT
NATIONAL RETAIL OPERATIONS.

00:33:45,339 --> 00:33:47,408
WHAT WAS THEIR ANSWER?

00:33:47,408 --> 00:33:49,477
$4 MILLION.

00:33:49,477 --> 00:33:53,247
JAMES, DO YOU OWN 100%
OF THIS BUSINESS?

00:33:53,247 --> 00:33:56,918
BETWEEN MYSELF AND MY ANGEL,
WE OWN 57%.

00:33:56,918 --> 00:33:58,953
SORRY, BETWEEN YOU AND WHO?
I HAVE ANGEL.

00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:02,590
INVESTOR.
WE STARTED, HE AND I,
TOGETHER ON 57%.

00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:06,961
WHO OWNS THE REST?
A COMBINATION
OF FRIENDS AND FAMILY.

00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:08,996
HOW MUCH MONEY DID YOU RAISE?

00:34:08,996 --> 00:34:11,599
UH, IT WAS ABOUT $500,000
TO $600,000.

00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,136
AND IT'S GONE?
IT'S GONE NOW, YES.

00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,437
GONE ON WHAT?

00:34:16,437 --> 00:34:19,140
THE PROBLEM IS,
WE GOT IT IN PIECES.

00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,675
WE NEVER GOT A CHUNK.

00:34:20,675 --> 00:34:23,211
YOU GOT KICKED OUT
OF A NATIONAL RETAILER.

00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:25,480
HOW ARE WE GONNA GET BACK IN?

00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,950
YOU KNOW, THE ECONOMY
SOON AFTER IN 2009,

00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:30,585
STARTED HITTING THE SKIDS.

00:34:30,585 --> 00:34:34,255
WE REFOCUSED.
WHO'S OUR PRIMARY CUSTOMER?

00:34:34,255 --> 00:34:37,058
THEY'RE NATURALLY MINDED
OR GREEN‐MINDED OR‐‐

00:34:37,058 --> 00:34:40,461
JAMES, IS THIS THE ONLY PRODUCT
IN THE WORLD

00:34:40,461 --> 00:34:42,463
THAT IS ALL‐NATURAL
THAT DOES THIS?

00:34:42,463 --> 00:34:46,567
THIS IS THE ONLY FOOD‐GRADE
ODOR ELIMINATOR TECHNOLOGY.

00:34:46,567 --> 00:34:48,836
IS THERE ANOTHER PRODUCT
THAT <i>ISN'T</i> FOOD‐GRADE

00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,838
THAT I <i>CAN'T</i> SPRAY
INTO BARBARA'S MOUTH

00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:52,840
BUT WILL STILL DO THE SAME JOB?

00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,610
UM, I KNOW MOST OF THE PEOPLE
THAT COME TO US

00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:57,278
HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED WITH...

00:34:57,278 --> 00:35:00,348
THERE ARE COMPETITORS.
THERE ARE COMPETITORS.

00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:03,484
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
ARE YOU READY TO LICENSE THIS

00:35:03,484 --> 00:35:07,088
TO SOMEBODY WHO ACTUALLY
CAN GET DISTRIBUTION?
HOW ARE WE GLOSSING OVER
THIS FACT?

00:35:07,088 --> 00:35:10,124
THEY RAISED $600,000.
THEY HIRED A PROFESSIONAL C. E. O.

00:35:10,124 --> 00:35:13,461
I'M SURE THAT GUY DID THAT.
WELL, JAMES,

00:35:13,461 --> 00:35:15,463
DID HE EVER GO
AND TALK ABOUT LICENSING

00:35:15,463 --> 00:35:18,466
TO A LARGE
CONSUMER PRODUCTS COMPANY?
NO, THIS WAS A GENTLEMAN‐‐

00:35:18,466 --> 00:35:20,701
NO, NO, NO. DON'T GIVE US
THE BACKGROUND.

00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:23,638
JUST SAY "YES" OR "NO."
HE W‐‐HE WAS NOT A C. E. O.
BEFORE THIS.

00:35:23,638 --> 00:35:26,974
SO YOU HIRED A BOZO
WHO BLEW $600,000.
JAMES, TELL ME "YES" OR "NO."

00:35:26,974 --> 00:35:30,545
DID HE GO AND CALL ON A LARGE
COMPANY TO TRY AND LI‐‐

00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,780
NO, HE DID NOT.
THAT WAS MY JOB.

00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:35,883
THEY WHY DID HE GET FIRED
AND NOT YOU?

00:35:37,451 --> 00:35:40,688
JAMES,
YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING US.

00:35:40,688 --> 00:35:42,857
WE JUST WANT "YES" OR "NO."

00:35:42,857 --> 00:35:45,760
ANY ANYBODY IN YOUR COMPANY
OR AFFILIATED WITH YOUR COMPANY

00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,130
TALKED TO A MAJOR PRODUCER
OF THIS TYPE OF PRODUCT?

00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:51,199
(Robert) IN THE LAST TWO YEARS.

00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:52,767
UM, MY FORMER C. E. O...

00:35:52,767 --> 00:35:55,069
YES OR NO? YES OR NO?
UH...

00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,171
TALKED TO A DIVISION...

00:35:57,171 --> 00:35:59,407
AND WHAT HAPPENED?
A COMPANY THAT'S LARGE ENOUGH

00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,809
THAT THEY HAVE MULTIPLE
DIVISIONS‐‐NOT JUST RETAIL.
OKAY.

00:36:01,809 --> 00:36:03,811
WHAT DID THEY SAY?
AND THEY SAID BASED
ON THE TESTING

00:36:03,811 --> 00:36:05,813
THAT THEY HAD DONE SO FAR,

00:36:05,813 --> 00:36:07,815
IT SHOWS IT'S
A VERY PROMISING OPPORTUNITY.

00:36:07,815 --> 00:36:11,219
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THAT OPPORTUNITY?
THAT WAS A WEEK AGO.

00:36:11,219 --> 00:36:15,089
A WEEK‐‐NO! LOOK, YOU'RE LIKE
A CLAM WE'VE BEEN PRYING OPEN.

00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:19,327
(Robert) WOW!
WHY'S IT TAKE SO LONG TO GET
TO THE OBVIOUS PATH OF SUCCESS?

00:36:19,327 --> 00:36:21,395
I JUST WANNA CLEAR THE FIELD
HERE A LITTLE.

00:36:21,395 --> 00:36:22,897
I'M DEFINITELY OUT.

00:36:24,398 --> 00:36:28,469
JAMES, YOU'VE GONE THROUGH
$600,000 OF INVESTORS' MONEY.

00:36:28,469 --> 00:36:30,538
NOW YOU WANT $150,000.

00:36:30,538 --> 00:36:33,040
I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,375
I'M OUT.

00:36:37,511 --> 00:36:41,349
JAMES... HERE'S MY DEAL.

00:36:43,751 --> 00:36:47,088
I THINK THE ONLY THING
MORE EXPENSIVE THAN EDUCATION

00:36:47,088 --> 00:36:49,190
IS IGNORANCE,

00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:51,659
AND YOU ARE IGNORANT
TO THIS MARKET.

00:36:51,659 --> 00:36:55,329
I'LL BRING THAT KNOWLEDGE,
BUT I NEED 50%.

00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,771
(O'Leary) HORRIFIC IDEA.
VERY BAD.

00:37:03,771 --> 00:37:07,074
LET ME TELL YOU MY IDEA,
ALL RIGHT?

00:37:07,074 --> 00:37:09,076
I'M GONNA BUY

100% FOR $150,000‐‐

00:37:11,545 --> 00:37:13,614
AND I'M GONNA FIRE YOU.

00:37:13,614 --> 00:37:17,184
THIS IS THE BEST NEWS
YOU'VE HEARD TODAY,

00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:19,754
BECAUSE I'M GONNA LEAVE YOU WITH
A 7% ROYALTY FOREVER‐‐

YOU'RE GONNA BE VERY RICH.

00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,728
THAT'S MY OFFER.

00:37:27,728 --> 00:37:30,731
I‐IS THERE NOTHING VALUED

00:37:30,731 --> 00:37:33,067
IN THE STAR POWER
THAT I HAVE‐‐

00:37:33,067 --> 00:37:37,138
YOU HAVE NO STAR POWER.
YOU'RE AN AWFUL SALESMAN.

00:37:37,138 --> 00:37:39,040
YOU ARE.

00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,576
YOU DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY
TO ANSWER A QUESTION DIRECTLY.

00:37:42,576 --> 00:37:44,946
AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT DOES

00:37:44,946 --> 00:37:48,316
TO PEOPLE THAT ARE LISTENING
TO YOU?

00:37:48,316 --> 00:37:51,319
IT MAKES THEM THINK
THAT YOU'RE SHIFTY.
JAMES, I DON'T CARE
ABOUT ANY OF THAT

00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:53,487
'CAUSE YOU'RE FIRED
THE SECOND I BUY THE COMPANY.

00:37:53,487 --> 00:37:55,656
WELL, I <i>DO</i> CARE ABOUT THAT

HE'S <i>REALLY</i> BAD AT HIS JOB...
WHO CARES?

00:37:59,794 --> 00:38:03,798
SO I CAN MAKE AN OFFER?
OKAY, SO HOW CAN I
BE BAD AT MY JOB

WHEN I BUILT THIS MARKET
FROM SCRATCH IN THE NORTHWEST‐‐

00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:09,570
JAMES, YES OR NO? BECAUSE IT IS
ABOUT TO BE RETRACTED.

DAYMOND, WE HEARD YOUR OFFER.
WE HEARD KEVIN'S OFFER.
