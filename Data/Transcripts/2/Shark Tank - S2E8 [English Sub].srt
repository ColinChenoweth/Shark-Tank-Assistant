00:16:59,224 --> 00:17:02,294
GIFT STORES‐‐SOME CARD
AND GIFT STORES THAT CARRY 'EM.

00:17:02,294 --> 00:17:05,130
IT'S JUST A, YOU KNOW,
A FUN PRODUCT TO‐‐
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?

00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:08,066
THE SALES? WE DID
$53,000, ROUGHLY, LAST YEAR,

00:17:08,066 --> 00:17:11,102
UM, THIS YEAR WE'RE GOING TO‐‐
$53,000 OR UNITS?

00:17:11,102 --> 00:17:13,438
$53,000 IN SALES.

00:17:13,438 --> 00:17:16,474
NOW, JOHNSON, YOU CAN'T EAT
THIS WAX. HOW DO YOU LIVE?

00:17:16,474 --> 00:17:18,777
WELL, MY WIFE WORKS
FULL‐TIME, SO...

00:17:18,777 --> 00:17:21,246
AND YOU DON'T WORK,
JUST DO CANDLES?
I DO CANDLES, YEAH.

00:17:21,246 --> 00:17:23,315
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING.

00:17:23,315 --> 00:17:25,617
YOU GOT A SHOT HERE, RIGHT?

00:17:25,617 --> 00:17:28,787
DON'T LET THESE GUYS
DRAG YOU DOWN.

00:17:28,787 --> 00:17:31,656
WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND?
I'M IN‐‐STILL IN COLLEGE.

00:17:31,656 --> 00:17:34,459
I CAME UP WITH THIS, UM,
AS MY BUSINESS PLAN

00:17:34,459 --> 00:17:38,830
FOR MY ENTREPRENEURSHIP CLASS.
DID YOU PUT ANY MONEY INTO THIS,
YOU AND YOUR WIFE?

00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:42,367
WE HAVE. WE'VE PUT
RIGHT AROUND $40,000 INTO IT.

00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:45,937
WHERE DO YOU MAKE THEM?
HOW ARE YOU MANUFACTURING THEM?

00:17:45,937 --> 00:17:48,640
UM, I HANDPOUR THEM,
EVERY ONE OF THEM.

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,408
YOU WHAT?
YOU HANDPOUR 'EM?

00:17:50,408 --> 00:17:53,178
I HANDPOUR THEM.
HE'S HANDPOURING EACH CANDLE
HIMSELF.

00:17:53,178 --> 00:17:54,446
MM.

00:17:55,747 --> 00:17:58,350
JOHNSON, I GOTTA ASK YOU, WHY?

00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,352
I'M SITTING HERE THINKING,

00:18:00,352 --> 00:18:03,455
HAS ANYBODY EVER TOLD YOU
THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA?

00:18:03,455 --> 00:18:06,458
DON'T KILL HIM YET, ROBERT.
IT'S ACTUALLY‐‐

00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,994
NO, YOU‐‐
NO, I WAS JUST WONDERING, MARK,

00:18:08,994 --> 00:18:12,464
HAS‐‐HAS HE GOTTEN
IN FRONT OF AN INVESTOR OR‐‐
WHAT HE'S GOTTEN‐‐
MORE IMPORTANTLY,

00:18:12,464 --> 00:18:14,666
HE'S GOTTEN
IN FRONT OF CUSTOMERS.

00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,701
SO YOU'VE GOT 'EM
IN THESE GIFT SHOPS

00:18:16,701 --> 00:18:18,703
AND YOU'VE GOT 'EM
IN THE MOM‐AND‐POP SHOPS.

00:18:18,703 --> 00:18:20,872
YOU KNOW, WHAT‐‐WHAT IS
THE NORMAL REORDER PATTERN?

00:18:20,872 --> 00:18:23,875
WELL, LIKE, FOR INSTANCE,
OUR‐‐OUR HIGH END, UM,

00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:26,544
CARD AND GIFT CHAINS
THAT CARRY THE PRODUCT,

00:18:26,544 --> 00:18:28,546
A LOT OF THOSE STORES,
YOU KNOW,

00:18:28,546 --> 00:18:32,183
WE SEE SIX TO SEVEN REORDERS
A YEAR.
A REORDER SIX, SEVEN TIMES
A YEAR IS NOT A LOT.

00:18:32,183 --> 00:18:35,453
YEAH. I MEAN, THAT'S NOTHING.

00:18:35,453 --> 00:18:37,322
JOHNSON,
THERE'S NOTHING PROPRIETARY

00:18:37,322 --> 00:18:40,325
ABOUT PUTTING WAX IN A CAN
AND SELLING IT.

00:18:40,325 --> 00:18:42,560
THIS FALLS INTO
A CATEGORY OF A PRODUCT

00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,829
I CALL "CRAP FOR TOURISTS,"

00:18:44,829 --> 00:18:48,433
AND I'M NOT SAYING IT'S BAD.
THE PET ROCK FELL INTO THAT

00:18:48,433 --> 00:18:50,535
AND MADE SOMEBODY
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

00:18:50,535 --> 00:18:52,537
I DON'T THINK THIS IS
A PET ROCK.

00:18:52,537 --> 00:18:55,040
I THINK
IT'S AN INTERESTING TCHOTCHKE.

00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,409
I CAN'T REALLY INVEST IN IT,
SO I'M OUT.

00:19:01,312 --> 00:19:03,515
I THINK YOUR BEST GIMMICK THERE
IS THE FART CANDLE.

00:19:03,515 --> 00:19:06,317
BUT, UM, THE BUSINESS
IS JUST NOT BIG ENOUGH.

00:19:06,317 --> 00:19:08,486
I'M OUT.

00:19:08,486 --> 00:19:10,488
THIS IS A SITUATION‐‐

00:19:10,488 --> 00:19:14,259
I REALLY CALL IT, UM,
A VITAMIN‐C DEFICIENCY...

00:19:16,294 --> 00:19:19,264
'CAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE CASH,
CREDIT, OR ENOUGH CUSTOMERS.

00:19:19,264 --> 00:19:21,533
I'M OUT.

00:19:24,202 --> 00:19:27,872
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS WILL MAKE
ANY MONEY. I'M OUT.

00:19:33,445 --> 00:19:35,513
WHO'S LEFT? JUST ME?

00:19:38,216 --> 00:19:39,951
YOU'RE KILLING ME, JOHNSON.

00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:44,889
ON‐‐ON ONE SIDE, I CAN SEE
THE ENTREPRENEURIAL VISION.

00:19:44,889 --> 00:19:47,258
I‐I SEE THE ATTACK DOG IN YOU
THAT JUST LOVES THIS

00:19:47,258 --> 00:19:49,394
AND IS READY TO RUN WITH IT.

00:19:49,394 --> 00:19:51,996
BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE,
YOU'RE A SINGLE PRODUCT,

00:19:51,996 --> 00:19:54,733
AND I DON'T KNOW IF
THAT'S REALLY A FULL COMPANY.

00:19:54,733 --> 00:19:57,736
AND BECAUSE I CAN'T VISUALIZE IT
AS A FULL COMPANY,

00:19:57,736 --> 00:19:59,237
I'M OUT.

00:20:01,606 --> 00:20:03,908
WELL, THANKS, GUYS.
I APPRECIATE IT.

00:20:03,908 --> 00:20:04,943
GOOD LUCK.

00:20:04,943 --> 00:20:08,747
♪♪♪

00:20:08,747 --> 00:20:11,082
HE WAS MISSING ONE FLAVOR THAT
WOULD'VE GOT ME INTERESTED‐‐

00:20:11,082 --> 00:20:13,384
MONEY. THE SMELL OF MONEY.

00:20:13,384 --> 00:20:15,120
(sharks laugh)

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,122
I THINK THE, YOU KNOW, SMELLING
THE FART CANDLE TOO LONG

00:20:17,122 --> 00:20:19,524
MIGHT'VE CLOUDED THEIR JUDGMENT
A LITTLE BIT, MIGHT'VE, UM,

00:20:19,524 --> 00:20:22,494
GAVE THEM A LITTLE, UM,
DEFICIENCY OF SOME TYPE.

00:20:31,069 --> 00:20:33,638
<i>NEXT INTO THE SHARK TANK</i>
<i>IS JULIE GOLDMAN</i>

00:20:33,638 --> 00:20:38,143
<i>WITH A BUSINESS CAPITALIZING ON</i>
<i>THE LUCRATIVE WEDDING INDUSTRY.</i>

00:20:43,782 --> 00:20:45,784
HELLO,
MY NAME IS JULIE GOLDMAN.

00:20:45,784 --> 00:20:49,220
I AM THE FOUNDER AND C. E. O.
OF THE ORIGINAL RUNNER COMPANY.

00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,489
I'M HERE TODAY
TO PRESENT MY BUSINESS

00:20:51,489 --> 00:20:54,659
AND TO REQUEST
A $250,000 INVESTMENT

00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:57,095
FOR A 15% STAKE IN MY COMPANY.

00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:02,534
I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT I PERFECT
LIFE'S GRAND ENTRANCES,

00:21:02,534 --> 00:21:04,969
AND I DO THIS
BECAUSE I'VE CREATED

00:21:04,969 --> 00:21:07,372
THE WORLD'S FIRST
NON‐SLIP FABRIC AISLE RUNNERS

00:21:07,372 --> 00:21:09,674
FOR WEDDINGS
AND SPECIAL EVENTS.

00:21:09,674 --> 00:21:12,310
WHEN I WAS PLANNING MY WEDDING,
I NEEDED AN AISLE RUNNER

00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:15,013
TO COVER THE ABSOLUTELY HIDEOUS
CARPETING IN THE CEREMONY VENUE.

00:21:15,013 --> 00:21:17,148
I THOUGHT THAT WOULD
BE REALLY EASY.

00:21:17,148 --> 00:21:19,350
I WOULD JUST GO DOWN
TO MY LOCAL STORE

00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,653
AND PICK UP AN AISLE RUNNER.
BUT WHEN I GOT THERE,

00:21:21,653 --> 00:21:23,922
IT WAS ACTUALLY MORE LIKE
GOING TO A SUPERMARKET

00:21:23,922 --> 00:21:27,158
BECAUSE MY CHOICES WERE
EITHER PAPER OR PLASTIC.

00:21:27,158 --> 00:21:29,160
AND NEITHER OF THESE
ARE REALLY GREAT OPTIONS

00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,162
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE WEARING
STILETTO HEELS,

00:21:31,162 --> 00:21:32,997
IT'S GONNA TEAR, RIP, BUNCH,

00:21:32,997 --> 00:21:36,000
AND THERE GO
YOUR WEDDING PICTURES.

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,136
THERE WAS ACTUALLY
NOTHING ELSE ON THE MARKET

00:21:38,136 --> 00:21:40,138
THAT WAS SAFE AND BEAUTIFUL.
I MADE MY OWN AISLE RUNNER,

00:21:40,138 --> 00:21:42,106
AND THE ORIGINAL RUNNER COMPANY
WAS BORN.

00:21:42,106 --> 00:21:45,810
MY VERY LOYAL WHOLESALE
AND CELEBRITY CLIENTELE

00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,979
HAS RESULTED IN MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS OF MY AISLE RUNNERS

00:21:47,979 --> 00:21:51,049
BEING SOLD WORLDWIDE
THROUGH MY WEB SITE ALONE.

00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:52,283
BUT THAT'S GONNA CHANGE TODAY

00:21:52,283 --> 00:21:54,819
BECAUSE I'M PRESENTING TO YOU
THE WALK‐SAFE AISLE RUNNER.

00:21:54,819 --> 00:21:59,057
THIS IS OUR 50‐FOOT
NON‐SLIP FABRIC AISLE RUNNER

00:21:59,057 --> 00:22:02,927
MASS PRODUCED AND SOLD IN RETAIL
STORES FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME

00:22:02,927 --> 00:22:05,830
AND THROUGH THOUSANDS
OF ONLINE WEDDING WEB SITES.

00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:08,199
(man speaks indistinctly)
THEY'RE JUST
PLAIN WHITE RUNNERS,

00:22:08,199 --> 00:22:10,869
WHICH IS THE MOST POPULAR
AISLE RUNNER SOLD IN THE WORLD.

00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:13,037
IN ADDITION, I'M INTRODUCING
FOR THE FIRST TIME

00:22:13,037 --> 00:22:15,173
OUR HOME MONOGRAMMING KIT.

00:22:15,173 --> 00:22:17,175
THIS IS GONNA ALLOW
THE DO‐IT‐YOURSELF BRIDE

00:22:17,175 --> 00:22:20,144
TO CREATE A MONOGRAMMED AISLE
RUNNER JUST LIKE THIS AT HOME

00:22:20,144 --> 00:22:22,881
FOR A FRACTION OF THE PRICE
THAT I CHARGE IN MY STUDIO.

00:22:22,881 --> 00:22:25,416
WE THINK THESE TWO
NEW RETAIL‐BASED OPTIONS

00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:28,253
WILL MAKE MY BRAND MUCH MORE
ACCESSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE

00:22:28,253 --> 00:22:30,555
TO THE MORE THAN
2 MILLION BRIDES

00:22:30,555 --> 00:22:32,857
THAT ARE MARRIED IN THE U. S.
ALONE EACH YEAR.

00:22:32,857 --> 00:22:35,193
SO IF YOU INVEST WITH
THE ORIGINAL RUNNER COMPANY,

00:22:35,193 --> 00:22:37,762
WE'RE GONNA MAKE MILLIONS
TOGETHER.

00:22:37,762 --> 00:22:41,099
WHAT'S THE TOTAL SALES
FOR BOTH BUSINESSES LAST YEAR?

00:22:41,099 --> 00:22:43,902
LAST YEAR WAS A DOWN ECONOMY,
AND WE SOLD $550,000.

00:22:43,902 --> 00:22:47,238
ACTUALLY, BEFORE THE RECESSION,
WE WERE SELLING $800,000,

00:22:47,238 --> 00:22:49,173
AND THIS YEAR WE'LL FINISH
ABOUT $650,000.

00:22:49,173 --> 00:22:51,242
YOU'RE A GREAT INDICATOR
OF THE RECESSION COMING BACK.

00:22:51,242 --> 00:22:53,244
NO, I'M A GREAT INDICATOR
OF REBUILDING MY BUSINESS

00:22:53,244 --> 00:22:56,881
LAST YEAR BY MOVING IT
OUT OF NEW YORK CITY,

00:22:56,881 --> 00:22:59,083
CUTTING MY RENT BY 80%,

00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:01,219
REFORMATTING HOW I WAS PAYING
MY SALARY STRUCTURES,

00:23:01,219 --> 00:23:05,089
AND INTRODUCING
THREE NEW LINES OF PRODUCTS.

00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:08,626
WHAT DOES THAT COST YOU
TO MAKE?
THIS IS GONNA COST ME
$25 TO MAKE.

00:23:08,626 --> 00:23:11,229
I'M GONNA SELL IT
TO THE RETAIL STORE FOR $37.50,

00:23:11,229 --> 00:23:13,231
MAKING A 52% PROFIT ON IT.

00:23:13,231 --> 00:23:16,234
THAT'S NOT THE CORRECT MARGIN.
WELL, THE MARGIN ON IT,

00:23:16,234 --> 00:23:19,437
IT'S GONNA BE 33%‐‐
IS THE PROFIT MARGIN ON IT.
IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

00:23:19,437 --> 00:23:22,941
OKAY, IT'S NOT ENOUGH.
WELL, ACTUALLY, IT DEPENDS
ON WHERE YOU'RE SELLING IT.

00:23:22,941 --> 00:23:24,976
IN STORES
LIKE LARGE CRAFT STORES,

00:23:24,976 --> 00:23:26,978
THAT MARGIN'S ACTUALLY
REALLY COMMON. IT'S MUCH LOWER.

00:23:26,978 --> 00:23:28,980
NO, THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH OUR SIDE OF THE BUSINESS.

00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,249
YOU HAVE TO AT LEAST MAKE
A 60% MARGIN ON THAT THEN.

00:23:31,249 --> 00:23:33,918
IF WE WERE TO ACTUALLY INVEST
MORE AND MAKE MORE OF THEM,

00:23:33,918 --> 00:23:35,987
WE COULD DRIVE THE PRICE DOWN
SIGNIFICANTLY.

00:23:35,987 --> 00:23:38,222
IS THIS PROPRIETARY?

00:23:38,222 --> 00:23:41,159
SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT THAT ONE
YOU WANNA MAKE OVER THERE?

00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:43,328
WE MAKE THE ONLY NON‐SLIP
FABRIC RUNNERS IN THE WORLD.

00:23:43,328 --> 00:23:46,197
AND IF YOU ACTUALLY DO NOT
WANNA HAVE PAPER OR PLASTIC,

00:23:46,197 --> 00:23:49,133
YOU HAVE TO GO BUY FABRIC,
HAVE IT HEMMED, AND MADE.
CAN YOUR COMPETITOR MAKE
THE SAME THING?

00:23:49,133 --> 00:23:52,870
I DON'T HAVE ANY COMPETITORS
THAT ARE DOING THAT, NO.
SO YOU'RE SAYING NOBODY ELSE
MAKES RUNNERS BUT YOU?

00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:55,306
NOT‐‐MAKE NON‐SLIP FABRIC
RUNNERS? NO. THE ONLY COMMER‐‐

00:23:55,306 --> 00:23:57,308
BUT CAN THEY MAKE NON‐SLIP
IF THEY WANTED TO,

00:23:57,308 --> 00:23:59,310
AFTER THEY SEE YOU DOING
SOMETHING THAT'S SUCCESSFUL?

00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:03,081
BECAUSE YOU DO OR DON'T HAVE
A PATENT. CAN THEY MAKE IT?
NO, YOU CAN'T PATENT FABRIC,

00:24:03,081 --> 00:24:06,084
JUST LIKE YOU COULDN'T PATENT
CLOTHING AND YOU MADE MILLIONS.

00:24:08,286 --> 00:24:10,288
I'M ASKING
A VERY SIMPLE QUESTION.

00:24:10,288 --> 00:24:13,157
CAN SOMEBODY ELSE MAKE
A NON‐SLIP RUNNER

00:24:13,157 --> 00:24:16,394
AFTER THEY SEE
THAT YOU ARE DOING WELL?

00:24:19,364 --> 00:24:22,200
THEY COULD.
BUT I'M ALREADY DOING WELL.
OKAY.

00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,903
I'M FIRST IN THE FIELD
AND VERY SUCCESSFUL
THAT'S ALL I'M‐‐
THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING.

00:24:25,903 --> 00:24:29,007
HOW IS THIS BUSINESS WORTH
$1.8 MILLION TODAY?

00:24:29,007 --> 00:24:32,677
IT'S ACTUALLY WORTH
MORE THAN THAT.
I LOVE THAT ANSWER.
"IT'S WORTH MORE." OKAY.

00:24:32,677 --> 00:24:34,679
YEAH, WELL, VALUATION CAN
ACTUALLY BE, OBVIOUSLY,

00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:36,214
DETERMINED
IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS.

00:24:36,214 --> 00:24:37,648
YOU CAN DO PROJECTED INCOMES.
YOU COULD DO CURRENT REVENUE.

00:24:37,648 --> 00:24:39,650
IF YOU BASE IT EVEN
ON CURRENT REVENUE ALONE,

00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:43,187
IF WE'RE MAKING $650,000
THIS YEAR, IF YOU'RE USING

00:24:43,187 --> 00:24:45,256
A 3 TO 5 RATIO, IT FALLS
VERY NICELY IN THE $1.8.
AHA.

00:24:45,256 --> 00:24:46,524
(mouths word)

00:24:46,524 --> 00:24:48,559
THIS THING YOU'RE STANDING ON,

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,362
HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST ME
FOR MY WEDDING?
OKAY, UM,

00:24:51,362 --> 00:24:54,198
SO THAT'S A HIGHER END OF OUR
LINE. THIS IS A 75‐FOOT RUNNER.

00:24:54,198 --> 00:24:55,767
IT'S HANDPAINTED
AND HAND‐CRYSTALED

00:24:55,767 --> 00:24:57,535
AND HAND‐GLITTERED.

00:24:57,535 --> 00:24:59,904
THIS ONE EXACTLY AS YOU SEE HERE
WOULD BE ABOUT $750.

00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:02,240
OKAY, SO AFTER ALL OF THAT COST,
WHAT'S YOUR MARGIN?

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,310
WHAT DID YOU MAKE ON THIS?
MY MARGIN ON THIS
IS ACTUALLY ABOUT 200%.

00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,412
WOW.

00:25:07,412 --> 00:25:09,047
MAKING $750 ON THIS,

00:25:09,047 --> 00:25:11,049
I'M PAYING ABOUT $250
TO MAKE IT,

00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:13,251
SO I'M MAKING ABOUT $500 ON IT.

00:25:13,251 --> 00:25:15,186
I'M CONFUSED.

00:25:15,186 --> 00:25:18,322
IF PEOPLE AT WEDDINGS
ARE SPENDING $750 FOR CUSTOM,

00:25:18,322 --> 00:25:20,258
WHY A DROP DOWN
TO A $60 PRODUCT?

00:25:20,258 --> 00:25:23,094
THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION.
TRUTHFULLY, MY CURRENT CLIENTS

00:25:23,094 --> 00:25:25,229
ARE SPENDING $50,000 OR MORE
ON THEIR WEDDING.

00:25:25,229 --> 00:25:26,531
$50,000?

00:25:26,531 --> 00:25:29,867
AND MORE. BUT THE AVERAGE
WEDDING IS $27,000,

00:25:29,867 --> 00:25:32,370
AND THEY'RE NOT BUYING
THESE AISLE RUNNERS.

00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:34,705
THEY CAN'T FIT IT
IN THEIR BUDGET.

00:25:34,705 --> 00:25:38,242
JULIE, WHAT'S GREAT
ABOUT A WEDDING

00:25:38,242 --> 00:25:40,178
IS NOBODY CARES ABOUT MONEY.
THIS IS THE TIME TO HIT 'EM.

00:25:40,178 --> 00:25:42,380
I DON'T WANNA GIVE 'EM
A CHEAP RUNNER.

00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:45,216
I WANNA GET THE $500 TO $700
PROFIT ON EVERY WEDDING,

00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,218
WHEN PEOPLE AREN'T LOOKING
AT WHAT THEY'RE SPENDING.

00:25:47,218 --> 00:25:50,254
YOU'VE GOT A FANTASTIC BUSINESS
THAT MAKES PHENOMENAL MARGINS.

00:25:50,254 --> 00:25:52,290
YOU'RE CAPTURING THE HIGH END.

00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,625
YOU WANNA GO PLAY
IN THE TOILET BOWL WEDDING.

00:25:56,227 --> 00:25:58,796
I DISAGREE. I WOULD NEVER
CONSIDER ANY WEDDING TO BE

00:25:58,796 --> 00:26:01,265
A TOILET BOWL WEDDING,
AND I THINK MY BRIDES WOULD BE

00:26:01,265 --> 00:26:04,168
HIGHLY OFFENDED
BY THAT COMMENT.
NO, NO, NO. THAT'S NOT WHAT
HE'S SAYING. THAT'S NOT WHAT

00:26:04,168 --> 00:26:06,838
HE'S SAYING. WHAT HE'S SAYING IS
YOU DOMINATE A CATEGORY.

00:26:06,838 --> 00:26:09,207
ADM SOMETIMES IT'S BETTER
TO BE THE BEST IN A NICHE

00:26:09,207 --> 00:26:12,310
THAN TRY TO GO OUT AND COMPETE
WITH ALL OTHER PRODUCTS.

00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,745
AND SO YOU'RE TAKING ON RISK
FOR INFRASTRUCTURE,

00:26:14,745 --> 00:26:16,814
RISK FOR INTERNAL MANAGEMENT,

00:26:16,814 --> 00:26:20,918
AND RISK IN THIS RETAIL MARKET.
WHY? HOW MUCH‐‐HOW MUCH‐‐
IT'S A LOST OPPORTUNITY.

00:26:20,918 --> 00:26:23,254
I'LL TELL YOU WHY
AND I CAN ANSWER THAT.
I DON'T THINK
IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY.

00:26:23,254 --> 00:26:27,024
WELL, ACTUALLY, I DISAGREE
AND I CAN EXPLAIN WHY.
WELL, LET HER‐‐LET HER‐‐
LET HER ANSWER.

00:26:27,024 --> 00:26:29,660
ACTUALLY, MOST CHURCHES
AND SYNAGOGUES

00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,663
NO LONGER ALLOW AISLE RUNNERS
BECAUSE THE ONLY ONES THEY‐‐
OOH! NEW INFORMATION!

00:26:32,663 --> 00:26:33,831
<i>WAIT.</i> WAIT.

00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,702
BECAUSE THEY ONLY HAVE SEEN
THE PAPER AND PLASTIC ONES.

00:26:37,702 --> 00:26:39,437
WHAT GENERALLY HAPPENS,

00:26:39,437 --> 00:26:41,439
MY CLIENTS WILL REQUEST
FREE SWATCHES‐‐

00:26:41,439 --> 00:26:43,741
WHICH WE SEND OUT
AROUND THE WORLD‐‐

00:26:43,741 --> 00:26:46,144
AND THEY TAKE IT THERE,
AND WE GET PERMISSION.

00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:48,179
WE'RE PERMITTED
IN LARGE CATHEDRALS

00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:50,181
THAT ALLOW ANY OTHER
AISLE RUNNERS BUT MINE.

00:26:50,181 --> 00:26:52,283
THE LIABILITY IS HUGE
WHY DO YOU WANNA GO RETAIL?
THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING.

00:26:52,283 --> 00:26:54,919
I DISAGREE.
BUT LOOK, JULIE, WHAT‐‐WHAT
THEY'RE IS, YOU HAVE A WEB SITE,

00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:56,921
YOU HAVE ALL THIS EXCLUSIVITY.

00:26:56,921 --> 00:26:58,923
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TELL
THE CHURCHES AND SYNAGOGUES,

00:26:58,923 --> 00:27:01,692
"GO TO THE WEB SITE." INSTEAD‐‐
BECAUSE THE CHURCHES
AREN'T BUYING THEM.

00:27:01,692 --> 00:27:03,895
THE BRIDES ARE BUYING THEM.
THE BRIDES HAVE TO KNOW...

00:27:03,895 --> 00:27:05,796
BUT, JULIE, I‐I‐‐
THEY EXIST, AND THE FACT IS,
ON THE INTERNET

00:27:05,796 --> 00:27:08,399
IT'S HARD TO GET THEM
TO KNOW WE EXIST.
WELL, BUT‐‐BUT LOOK,

00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:11,002
YOU WANNA TAKE ON
ALL THIS INCREMENTAL RISK.

00:27:11,002 --> 00:27:13,004
LOWER MARGIN
BECAUSE IT'S RETAIL, RIGHT?

00:27:13,004 --> 00:27:15,473
AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
33% MARGINS.
WAIT TILL THE STORES

00:27:15,473 --> 00:27:18,009
START ASKING FOR INCENTIVES...
(speaks indistinctly)
IF SHE CAN'T SEE THAT HERSELF...

00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:22,380
(Daymond) AND YOU KNOW WHY
SHE CAN'T SEE IT?
(Mark) AND, JULIE,
YOU'RE NOT MAKING THE BEST...

00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:25,283
(Daymond and O'Leary
speaking indistinctly)
ENOUGH!

00:27:26,851 --> 00:27:29,554
MY GOSH!
YOU'RE WORSE THAN WOMEN.

00:27:31,956 --> 00:27:33,991
YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T THINK
YOU NEED ANYBODY HERE.

00:27:33,991 --> 00:27:37,261
YOU GOT TO WHERE YOU WERE
ON YOUR OWN.

00:27:37,261 --> 00:27:38,996
I DON'T AGREE
WITH YOUR STRATEGY,

00:27:38,996 --> 00:27:41,732
AND FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.

00:27:45,036 --> 00:27:47,705
YOU'RE MISSING THE OBVIOUS,
JULIE.

00:27:47,705 --> 00:27:50,374
YOU WANNA HAVE ALL THESE
RETAILERS TAKING RESPONSIBILITY

00:27:50,374 --> 00:27:52,343
FOR YOUR PRODUCTS
AND SELLING THEM.

00:27:52,343 --> 00:27:56,314
THEY'RE NOT GONNA SELL IT
NEARLY AS WELL AS YOU CAN.

00:27:56,314 --> 00:27:58,182
I'M OUT.

00:27:58,182 --> 00:27:59,483
OKAY.

00:28:01,052 --> 00:28:03,854
JULIE, I WOULD RATHER HAVE

00:28:03,854 --> 00:28:08,426
A SUCCESSFUL, PROFITABLE
$2 MILLION BUSINESS

00:28:08,426 --> 00:28:10,861
THAN RISK <i>EVERYTHING</i>

00:28:10,861 --> 00:28:14,465
TO MAYBE, <i>MAYBE</i> GET
TO $4 MILLION OR $5 MILLION.

00:28:14,465 --> 00:28:17,268
I CAN'T SEE THIS SCALING
INTO A LARGE BUSINESS.

00:28:17,268 --> 00:28:18,769
I'M OUT.

00:28:23,674 --> 00:28:26,944
TWO WORDS‐‐I'M OUT.

00:28:26,944 --> 00:28:29,447
<i>FOUR SHARKS ARE OUT.</i>

00:28:29,447 --> 00:28:33,884
<i>KEVIN O'LEARY IS JULIE'S</i>
<i>LAST CHANCE TO GET A DEAL.</i>

00:28:33,884 --> 00:28:37,221
LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS,
ALL RIGHT?

00:28:37,221 --> 00:28:39,657
THANK GOODNESS WE'VE MET.
HERE'S WHY‐‐

00:28:39,657 --> 00:28:42,560
YOU NEED ME BADLY.
YOU JUST DON'T KNOW IT.

00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,762
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU $250,000...

00:28:46,397 --> 00:28:48,399
FOR 51% OF YOUR BUSINESS.

00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,469
THAT'S CONTROL.

00:28:51,469 --> 00:28:53,471
YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO
ANYTHING WITHOUT CALLING ME

00:28:53,471 --> 00:28:56,040
'CAUSE I'M GONNA KEEP YOU
ON THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW

00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,809
TO MAKE ME MONEY. BUT BECAUSE
YOU OWN 49%, YOU'LL GET RICH.

00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:02,246
THAT'S WHY THEY CALL ME
MR. WONDERFUL.

00:29:03,547 --> 00:29:06,717
HE'S SO APPEALING, ISN'T HE?

00:29:06,717 --> 00:29:09,920
YOU NEED MY GUIDANCE
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOTTEN LOST.

00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,922
I FIND THAT REALLY INTERESTING
FOR YOU TO SAY

00:29:11,922 --> 00:29:14,692
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN WORKING IN
THIS BUSINESS FOR SEVEN YEARS.

00:29:14,692 --> 00:29:17,194
I'M KNOWN AS THE AISLE GURU
AND BECAUSE I KNOW

00:29:17,194 --> 00:29:19,530
WHAT THE HECK I'M DOING.
I KNOW MY BUSINESS.
WELL, I KNOW‐‐

00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:22,600
(Mark) EXACTLY WHAT, JULIE?
NONE OF YOU KNOW THE INDUSTRY.

00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,769
BUT I KNOW HOW TO MAKE MONEY.

00:29:24,769 --> 00:29:27,605
LOOK, JULIE, YOU'VE MET ME‐‐
THE BEST DAY OF YOUR LIFE,

00:29:27,605 --> 00:29:29,407
OTHER THAN WHEN YOU GOT MARRIED.

00:29:29,407 --> 00:29:31,409
BUT WE'RE GONNA GET
INTO A FINANCIAL MARRIAGE.

00:29:31,409 --> 00:29:33,844
AND YOU'RE GONNA LOVE ME.
BELIEVE ME.

00:29:33,844 --> 00:29:36,847
MM. LOVING YOU ALREADY. (laughs)
I'M GONNA
KEEP YOU STRAIGHT AND NARROW.

00:29:36,847 --> 00:29:39,450
OKAY.
YOU WILL NEVER
THINK ABOUT THIS AGAIN

00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:41,452
OR EVER DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

00:29:41,452 --> 00:29:44,155
YOU HAVE TO WALK DOWN THE PATH
OF HIGH MARGIN RUNNER,

00:29:44,155 --> 00:29:46,791
NOT THE TOILET BOWL WEDDING. I'M
GONNA KEEP YOU OUT OF THAT MESS

00:29:46,791 --> 00:29:49,860
BECAUSE I'M GONNA OWN 51%
OF THE BUSINESS. YES OR NO?

00:29:52,063 --> 00:29:53,464
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

00:29:55,199 --> 00:29:57,001
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND.
WHY?

00:29:57,001 --> 00:29:59,704
TO BE FRANK, I WOULD NEVER
GIVE UP 51% OF MY BUSINESS.

00:29:59,704 --> 00:30:01,806
YOU NEED TO GIVE UP 51%.
I ACTUALLY DON'T.

00:30:01,806 --> 00:30:03,774
YOU NEED ME BADLY.
I TOOK AN IDEA
THAT DIDN'T EXIST,

00:30:03,774 --> 00:30:05,776
I MADE THE WORLD KNOW
IT EXISTS.

I'M MOVING INTO EUROPE
NEXT YEAR.

I'M THE VERA WANG
OF AISLE RUNNERS.

00:30:13,718 --> 00:30:16,520
I DON'T NEED 51% OF MY BUSINESS
BEING TAKEN BY SOMEONE

00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,890
WHO DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
THE WEDDING INDUSTRY.
I UNDERSTAND HOW TO MAKE MONEY.

00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:23,027
THAT'S ALL
YOU HAVE TO CARE ABOUT.
SO JUST COUNTER.

00:30:25,096 --> 00:30:27,698
I'M COUNTERING BACK AT 15%.
I'M LOOKING FOR AN INVESTMENT,

00:30:27,698 --> 00:30:31,602
NOT A FULL INVESTED PARTNER.
YOUR BUSINESS ISN'T WORTH
$1.8 MILLION.

00:30:31,602 --> 00:30:33,604
I THINK IT IS.

00:30:33,604 --> 00:30:36,574
TURN AROUND, GET OUT OF HERE.

00:30:36,574 --> 00:30:39,543

00:30:44,648 --> 00:30:46,384
WOULD <i>NEVER</i> GIVE HER CONTROL.

00:30:46,384 --> 00:30:49,920
SHE WOULD EAT YOU UP

WITHOUT EVEN THINKING TWICE.

I JUST TURNED DOWN
KEVIN O'LEARY'S OFFER

BECAUSE IT WAS
ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS.

00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,562
THERE WAS NO WAY

51% CONTROL OF MY COMPANY

00:31:38,453 --> 00:31:40,455
THAT IT WAS TAKING WAY TOO LONG

00:31:40,455 --> 00:31:43,291
TO PROVIDE WATER
TO THE FIRE SCENE.

00:31:43,291 --> 00:31:46,261

HyConn WAS DEVELOPED.

OKAY, NOW HE'S GOT IT TIGHT.

00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,736
OKAY, NOW LET'S DISCONNECT
TO SHOW THE SPEED ON THAT.

00:34:07,736 --> 00:34:10,405
OKAY, BEGIN.

00:34:11,973 --> 00:34:15,076
YOU CAN SEE THE SPEED IT TAKES
TO DISCONNECT THE HyConn

00:34:15,076 --> 00:34:16,912
VERSUS YOUR STANDARD HOSE

00:34:16,912 --> 00:34:19,581
THAT'S BEING USED ACROSS
THE UNITED STATES TODAY.

00:34:19,581 --> 00:34:21,883
AT A FIRE SCENE,
EVERY SECOND MATTERS.

00:34:21,883 --> 00:34:23,952
YOUR STANDARD CONNECTIONS

00:34:23,952 --> 00:34:26,855
CAN SOMETIMES TAKE
30 SECONDS OR MORE.

00:34:26,855 --> 00:34:28,857
HyConn CAN BE DONE
IN LESS THAN 3 SECONDS

00:34:28,857 --> 00:34:30,692
AND DISCONNECTED IN A SECOND.

00:34:30,692 --> 00:34:32,694
NOW THERE'S
OVER 33,000 FIRE DEPARTMENTS

00:34:32,694 --> 00:34:35,997
ACROSS THE UNITED STATES.

00:34:35,997 --> 00:34:37,899
NOW THERE'S MILLIONS TO BE MADE
AT THIS MARKET ALONE.

00:34:37,899 --> 00:34:39,901
WHO'S READY
TO MAKE MILLIONS WITH ME?

00:34:41,903 --> 00:34:44,439
WHERE YOU FROM, JEFF?
I'M FROM ARKANSAS.

00:34:44,439 --> 00:34:46,875
AND WHAT ABOUT YOUR
BASE DEPARTMENT WHERE YOU WORK?

00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:49,077
WHAT‐‐ARE‐‐ARE THEY
A CUSTOMER?
THEY LOVE IT.
THEY‐‐THEY WANNA USE 'EM.

00:34:49,077 --> 00:34:51,079
THE ONLY REASON
WE'RE NOT USING 'EM YET

00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:53,081
IS BECAUSE ME WORKING THERE,

00:34:53,081 --> 00:34:56,585
THEY CAN'T BUY THEM
STRAIGHT FROM ME.
HOW ARE YOU GONNA SELL THIS?

00:34:56,585 --> 00:35:01,489
SO LET'S SAY IT WAS‐‐
WHAT, 20 SECONDS DIFFERENCE.
IT WAS AN 8‐SECOND DIFFERENCE
ON MY COUNT.

00:35:01,489 --> 00:35:03,592
CAN I GO TO A FIRE DEPARTMENT
AND SAY,

00:35:03,592 --> 00:35:06,094
"YOU'RE GONNA SAVE 8 SECONDS.
BUY THIS"?

00:35:06,094 --> 00:35:08,797
DO YOU THINK THAT
THERE'S BUDGET FOR THIS?

00:35:08,797 --> 00:35:11,566
I‐I DO.
BASICALLY, THE LAST MONTH

00:35:11,566 --> 00:35:13,635
IS WHEN I STARTED MAKING
MY SALES CALLS.

00:35:13,635 --> 00:35:16,037
AND OUT OF 11 DEPARTMENTS
THAT I VISITED,

00:35:16,037 --> 00:35:18,039
I'VE HAD FOUR
THAT'S GIVEN ME HARD P. O. s.

00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:20,642
THE OTHER SIX ARE WORKING ON
GETTING THE PAPERWORK TOGETHER

00:35:20,642 --> 00:35:22,744
TO GIVE ME THE P. O.

00:35:22,744 --> 00:35:24,946
WHAT DID YOU SELL THEM FOR?

00:35:24,946 --> 00:35:27,849
THIS SIZE HERE, THE SMALLER ONE,
IS SOLD FOR, UH, $215.

00:35:27,849 --> 00:35:31,419
THE LARGER THAT GOES
ON THE STEAMER VALVE IS $385.

00:35:31,604 --> 00:35:34,674
(O'Leary) JEFF,
THE ONLY NEGATIVE TO YOUR STORY

00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,642
IS YOU'RE SELLING
TO THE GOVERNMENT.

00:35:36,642 --> 00:35:38,611
YOUR SECTOR'S UNDER STRESS
FOR BUDGET CUTS.

00:35:38,611 --> 00:35:41,247
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY.
ASSUMING THEY LIKED IT,

00:35:41,247 --> 00:35:43,249
HOW MUCH MONEY WOULD
THAT PARTICULAR FIREHOUSE

00:35:43,249 --> 00:35:45,251
HAVE TO PUT OUT
TO BUY ENOUGH OF THEM

00:35:45,251 --> 00:35:47,253
TO EQUIP
THEIR TYPICAL EQUIPMENT?

00:35:47,253 --> 00:35:49,789
MOST FIRE DEPARTMENTS,
THE WAY I'VE GOT IT FIGURED OUT,

00:35:49,789 --> 00:35:51,791
ARE GONNA AVERAGE
ABOUT 35 UNITS.

00:35:51,791 --> 00:35:54,794
$7,000, ROUGHLY,
IS YOUR TYPICAL SALE,

00:35:54,794 --> 00:35:56,829
IF YOU SAID
YOU SOLD TYPICALLY 35.

00:35:56,829 --> 00:36:00,833
SO THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.
(man speaks indistinctly)

00:36:00,833 --> 00:36:03,636
(Robert) GOING ALONG THAT LINE‐‐
NOBODY HAS BUDGET.
MM‐HMM.

00:36:03,636 --> 00:36:06,639
ISN'T THE REAL PLAY HERE, IF YOU
COULD GET FIRE DEPARTMENTS

00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:08,975
TO MANDATE THIS PRODUCT,

00:36:08,975 --> 00:36:12,311
IF YOU COULD
GET MUNICIPALITIES TO SAY,

00:36:12,311 --> 00:36:15,181
"YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS HOSE
'CAUSE IT SAVES LIVES."
RIGHT.

00:36:15,181 --> 00:36:17,850
HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE
TO GET FIRE DEPARTMENTS

00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,852
TO APPROVE IT THAT WAY?

00:36:19,852 --> 00:36:23,456
WE'RE WORKING TOWARD THAT. WE
HAVE NOT GOT THAT APPROVAL YET.

00:36:23,456 --> 00:36:25,024
ARE THERE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS

00:36:25,024 --> 00:36:27,994
THAT PROVIDE DIRECT PRODUCTS TO
FIRE STATIONS? LIKE THAT JACKET.

00:36:27,994 --> 00:36:31,731
IS THERE A COMPANY
THAT DISTRIBUTES THAT DIRECTLY?
YES, THERE IS.

00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:34,767
HAVE YOU TALKED TO THEM
ABOUT THIS PRODUCT?
YES, I HAVE.

00:36:34,767 --> 00:36:36,936
AND WHAT HAVE THEY SAID TO YOU?
I WENT INTO THEM,

00:36:36,936 --> 00:36:38,938
TRYING TO MAKE A DEAL
FOR THEM TO BUY THE PATENT.

00:36:38,938 --> 00:36:41,741
AFTER THEY LOOKED AT IT,
THEY SAID THAT AT PRESENT TIME,

00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,010
THEY WASN'T READY TO BUY IT,

00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:46,545
SO THEY WANTED TO HELP ME
DISTRIBUTE THEM.

00:36:46,545 --> 00:36:48,547
THEY WANNA PUT IT
IN THEIR PRODUCT LINE.

00:36:48,547 --> 00:36:52,718
AND HOW MUCH CAPITAL DO YOU NEED
TO GET IT INTO DISTRIBUTION?
$500,000.

00:36:52,718 --> 00:36:55,821
I CAN'T GET OVER THE FACT

00:36:55,821 --> 00:36:57,823
THAT THE DISTRIBUTORS
WANT YOU TO TAKE ON

00:36:57,823 --> 00:37:00,292
THE FINANCIAL CHALLENGE
OF MAKING THE PRODUCTS,

00:37:00,292 --> 00:37:03,629
SO THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN IT
TO THAT EXTENT.

00:37:03,629 --> 00:37:05,731
SO I'M OUT.

00:37:09,902 --> 00:37:12,104
I KEEP WEIGHING
THAT 8 SECONDS SAVINGS,

00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:17,009
PITCHING A MUNICIPALITY
AGAINST SPENDING $7,000,

00:37:17,009 --> 00:37:19,011
AND I DON'T THINK
THEY'RE GONNA DO IT.

00:37:19,011 --> 00:37:20,880
I'M OUT.

00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,015
JEFF, I LOVE THE DESIGN.

00:37:23,015 --> 00:37:26,886
WHY CAN'T YOU USE IT
FOR... OIL PIPELINES?

00:37:26,886 --> 00:37:30,089
OR WHY CAN'T YOU EVEN USE IT FOR
THE‐‐THE HOSE I HAVE AT HOME?

00:37:30,089 --> 00:37:34,894
'CAUSE I CAN NEVER SCREW IN
THAT STUPID HOSE AT HOME.

00:37:34,894 --> 00:37:36,395
RIGHT. LIKE THAT ONE?

00:37:39,732 --> 00:37:42,735
WHY'D YOU WAIT SO LONG
TO SHOW US THAT?
YEAH, NO KIDDING.

00:37:42,735 --> 00:37:45,471
NOW THAT WILL BE MADE
OUT OF PLASTIC.

00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:48,774
THIS IS PART OF THE SAME DEAL?
PART OF THE SAME THING.

00:37:48,774 --> 00:37:51,110
DO YOU HAVE A PATENT ON THAT?
THAT PATENT FALLS UNDER
THE SAME THING.

00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:53,779
HAVE YOU TRIED TO SELL THIS?
NO, I HAVEN'T.

00:37:53,779 --> 00:37:57,083
THE MAIN REASON WHY IS BECAUSE I
BEEN FOCUSING ON THE FIRE SIDE.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
LET'S STOP.

00:37:57,083 --> 00:37:59,085
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH THE FIRE THING,

00:37:59,085 --> 00:38:01,153
BUT YOU'RE REALIZING
HOW DIFFICULT IT IS

00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:03,456
TO CHANGE THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY.
NOW ON THE OTHER HAND,

00:38:03,456 --> 00:38:05,458
THERE ARE TWO OR THREE
HOSE MAKERS IN THE U. S.

00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:07,827
THAT SUPPLY ALL THE BIG BOXES.
THEY'RE HUGE.

00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:10,930
WHY WOULDN'T YOU GO
TO THEM AND SAY,

00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:12,932
"I HAVE A BETTER WAY
TO ATTACH YOUR GARDEN HOSE

00:38:12,932 --> 00:38:16,035
TO EVERY HOME IN AMERICA"?
AND YOU CAN PAY ME 20 CENTS

00:38:16,035 --> 00:38:18,037
AND YOU CAN MANUFACTURE
THIS YOURSELF.

00:38:18,037 --> 00:38:21,774
THAT'S ONLY ONE CALL TO THEM.
I HAVEN'T WORKED ON IT‐‐

00:38:21,774 --> 00:38:24,677
LIKE I SAID, I HAVEN'T WORKED ON
THE HOUSEHOLD SIDE OF IT AT ALL

00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,679
OTHER THAN MAKING A SAMPLE

00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:30,416
TO SEE IF IT WOULD FUNCTION
LIKE THAT.
LET ME JUST TELL YOU,
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.

00:38:30,416 --> 00:38:33,786
20 CENTS IS WAY TOO LOW.
JEFF, DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE
IN YOUR POCKETS?

00:38:33,786 --> 00:38:36,088
NO, SIR. NO, I DON'T.
(O'Leary)
LET ME SEE THAT RIGHT NOW.

00:38:36,088 --> 00:38:38,424
THIS IS A BIG DEAL.

00:38:38,424 --> 00:38:41,460
(Mark) YOU KNOW WHAT, JEFF?
I LIKE THIS SO MUCH.

00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:45,231
WHAT IF I OFFERED YOU
$1.25 MILLION

00:38:45,231 --> 00:38:48,000
FOR YOUR COMPANY

00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,736
PLUS A 3‐YEAR
EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

00:38:50,736 --> 00:38:54,874
AT 100K PER YEAR
TO RUN THE SHOW?

00:38:56,342 --> 00:38:58,444
AND I'LL PAY YOU
A PERCENTAGE OF THE PROFITS

00:38:58,444 --> 00:39:01,347
ONCE WE HIT CERTAIN HURDLES
THAT WE AGREE TO.

00:39:01,347 --> 00:39:04,984
WAIT A SECOND. BEFORE YOU EVEN
CONSIDER THAT MADNESS...

WATCHING A GREAT ENTREPRENEUR

WAIT, HOLD ON. HOLD ON.

YOU'RE SELLING OUT

AN IMPORTANT PART

00:39:57,503 --> 00:40:00,506
AND SO WE DON'T WANT
TO GIVE THAT AWAY.
"WE"? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT "WE"?

00:40:00,506 --> 00:40:02,841
MY PARTNER.
HE'S <i>MY</i> PARTNER.

00:40:02,841 --> 00:40:05,811
I'M NOT TAKING EVERYTHING,
HIS WHOLE LIFE FROM HIM,

00:40:05,811 --> 00:40:08,781
LIKE YOU ARE.
I'M NOT EITHER.
I'M PAYING HIM A SALARY.

00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:13,485
IN ARKANSAS, $100,000
IS GOING TO GO A LONG WAY.
NO, YOU'RE SUCKING THE LIFE
OUT OF HIM.

00:40:13,485 --> 00:40:15,321
JEFF, WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT MARK'S OFFER?

00:40:15,321 --> 00:40:18,257
I WOULD WANT TO KNOW
WHAT THE PERCENTAGE IS,

00:40:18,257 --> 00:40:20,326
LONG‐TERM PERCENTAGE.
OKAY.

00:40:20,326 --> 00:40:23,229
UH, I WOULD WANT AT LEAST
7 1/2% ROYALTIES LONG‐TERM.

00:40:23,229 --> 00:40:25,297
I WAS GONNA MAKE YOU AN OFFER
ALONG THE LINE OF, UH,

00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:28,901
MR. CUBAN, BUT THAT'S MORE
GENEROUS THAN I WAS GONNA BE,

00:40:28,901 --> 00:40:30,903
AT $1.25 MILLION.

00:40:30,903 --> 00:40:33,906
I WAS NOT AT $1.25 MILLION.
I'M OUT.

00:40:36,442 --> 00:40:38,477
I'M GONNA LEAVE MY OFFER
EXACTLY THE WAY IT IS

00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,479

IT‐‐IT DISTURBS ME IMMENSELY

00:40:45,951 --> 00:40:48,454
TO WATCH YOU SUCK THE LIFE
OUT OF THIS MAN.
(Mark speaks indistinctly)

00:40:48,454 --> 00:40:51,357
HE'S WORKED SO HARD
TO GET TO WHERE HE IS,

00:40:51,357 --> 00:40:54,393
AND YOU'RE JUST TAKING IT
ALL AWAY FROM HIM.
THAT IS SUCH... BAHOOEY, RIGHT?

00:40:54,393 --> 00:40:58,530
AND THAT'S THE MOST POLITE WORD
I CAN COME UP WITH.
BAHOOEY?

00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:00,899
MY OFFER'S VERY SIMPLE.
I GIVE YOU $500,000

00:41:00,899 --> 00:41:05,271
FOR EVERYTHING EXCEPT
THE FIRE HOSE, FOR 5%.

00:41:05,271 --> 00:41:08,207
IT GIVES YOU THE CASH YOU NEED
FOR EVERYTHING ELSE.

00:41:08,207 --> 00:41:10,376

100%? YOU DON'T DO 100% DEALS.
(Mark speaks indistinctly)

00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:49,248
THAT'S CRAZY.

00:41:49,248 --> 00:41:51,850
BETWEEN THE TWO OFFERS...

00:41:53,585 --> 00:41:55,854

A LOT BETTER.

00:41:57,523 --> 00:41:59,458

ABSOLUTELY.
CONGRATULATIONS. GOOD JOB, GUYS.
REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

00:42:09,601 --> 00:42:12,404
GOOD JOB. THANKS FOR BEING
FIREMEN. APPRECIATE IT.

00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:14,973
ALL RIGHT!

00:42:14,973 --> 00:42:17,643
IT'S OFFENSIVE.
MARK, IT'S OVER BETWEEN US.

00:42:17,643 --> 00:42:19,878
HE WENT RIGHT TO THE TOP
OF THAT OFFER RANGE

00:42:19,878 --> 00:42:21,880
IMMEDIATELY.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU DON'T THINK TWICE.

00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,149
WHEN THIS COMPANY IS WORTH
$50 MILLION, $60 MILLION,

00:42:24,149 --> 00:42:27,052
WE'RE NOT GONNA LOOK BACK
AND SAY, "BOY, I GAVE HIM

00:42:27,052 --> 00:42:29,088
$1.25 MILLION. I SHOULD'VE
GIVEN HIM $1 MILLION."

00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,390
YOU DON'T REALLY WANNA
NEGOTIATE ANY OF IT?
I DON'T NEED TO SAVE $50

00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:34,460
WHEN I'M GONNA‐‐WHEN I'M LOOKING
AT MAKING $50 MILLION.

00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,929
WHEN CAN WE HAVE A MEETING?
'CAUSE I HAVE A LOT OF COMPANIES

00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,865
I CAN SELL YOU.
IF‐‐IF THEY'RE LIKE THAT,
I'LL BUY 'EM.

00:42:39,865 --> 00:42:41,867
YOU KNOW, WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT

00:42:41,867 --> 00:42:43,869
THAT SOMEONE
FROM A SMALL TOWN IN ARKANSAS

00:42:43,869 --> 00:42:46,472
WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE
A $1.25 MILLION DEAL

00:42:46,472 --> 00:42:49,608
WITH MARK CUBAN?
THIS IS JUST THE GREATEST.
