bigger stores?

00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,989
The--Phase two is to open up
a bigger store,

00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:05,559
release the other shoe styles
that we have the technology for,

00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:08,161
then at that point, I want
to look into franchising.

00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:09,363
How many machines do you have
in the store, one?

00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,597
We have one.

00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:11,899
Right, so you can't make
that many

00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:13,267
if it takes
up to 30 minutes, right?

00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,502
Okay, here's the thing--
Each Retail store

00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,070
is open regular hours
just like any retail store,

00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:20,007
but at night, they turn into
fulfillment centers.

00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:21,241
You see
this button right here?
Right. But you see what I'm--

00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:22,409
this--hold on. Hang on.

00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:24,444
This button is green
for a reason--

00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:26,580
Because every time we press it,
we make money.

00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:27,581
(mark laughs)
right?

00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:28,782
Oh, I like that.
(laughs)

00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:30,584
Nick, how much does
the printer cost you?

00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:32,286
It cost $55,000.

00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:34,721
You altered the Printer.
Can anybody else do that?

00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,456
No. We've--like I said,
we've got these in--

00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:38,025
--In patent pending right now,
so, I mean...

00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,027
then why aren't we leasing
this printer

00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:42,496
to everybody in the country
or the world--

00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:44,398
Why would you
ignore the fact--

00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,400
I started a business--
I'm gonna ignore it
because I've backed

00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,402
about four or five
REALLY cool brands like yours,

00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,537
and they're usually cool
and they're broke.
But We're not a brand.

00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:52,539
There's two types of people
in this world.

00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:54,107
There's either sharks
and the rest of the people

00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:55,309
who want to be sharks.
That's it.
(laughs)

00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:56,844
and I'm trying to get you
to be a shark.

00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,078
Okay.

00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,547
Right? So if this technology
is Good enough

00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:02,716
where we can lease people
the printer for $100,000

00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:04,051
and get a percentage--

00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:06,053
I don't care if they do
just their families,

00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:08,055
they do bar mitzvah--
I don't care what they do.

00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:10,057
That's one thing,
but the--the other part of it

00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:12,059
that I--that we haven't
really talked about yet

00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:15,629
that I think is Really important
is licensing images, right?

00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:18,298
When you walk into an ave,
you're gonna see

00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:19,666
touch screens
all over the wall

00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,668
with thousands--
Thousands of images

00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:23,170
that people can just sit there
and go through.

00:08:23,237 --> 00:08:24,538
They can spend hours...
(daymond) Nick, you know what?

00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:25,772
Looking at pictures...
Nick.

00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,773
And looking
at different stuff--

00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,075
Nick, Nick, hold it
one second.

00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:29,576
You're trying to work hard
instead of working smart.

00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:31,578
I think you're--
You're incredibly cool,

00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:34,515
but I've lost a lot of money
with the cool guys.

00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:36,717
They're still cool, but not--
and I was broke, you know,

00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:38,519
after--After investing in 'em,

00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:40,521
so with that, I'm out.

00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:44,658
(mark) He's right,

00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:46,960
but that doesn't diminish
the opportunity.

00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,029
The question is,
what's the special sauce?

00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:50,664
And that's, what'd you call it,
your platum or--

00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:52,499
Platen.
Yeah, your platen, right?

00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:53,867
And that's what's unique.

00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:55,202
And if you can take that

00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:57,704
and market it to other people
and let them do all the work,

00:08:57,771 --> 00:09:00,007
you can have fun with the ave
and make money off the ave,

00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:02,309
and that's all good--
That's the problem
with this deal.

00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:03,744
Everybody has a different
version of the business model,

00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,345
including you.
Well, no,
it's the same version.

00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:06,813
It's the same version,
it's just, where's the leverage?

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,049
I think Nick Sees the leverage
as being open up a lot of stores

00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:11,318
'cause it's cool and hip
and we'll grow it, right?
What's proprietary

00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:13,253
is that single plate
that holds those shoes in place.

00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,189
(Robert) Mark's got
the big picture down here.

00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:17,858
I think the problem is, Nick is
seeing the little picture today.

00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:20,093
That concerns me a lot.

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,062
I don't want to change
the guy's business model,

00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:24,064
and at this point,
for me,

00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:26,133
I'm out.

00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,271
Now look,
here's the thing you guys--

00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:33,140
I just want to make
a ton of money. That's it.

00:09:33,207 --> 00:09:35,275
I'm already to the point where I
have employees doing the work.

00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:36,677
I'm never
in the store anymore.

00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,679
I'm trying to grow it.
That's why I'm here.

00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,949
That's why I'm in front of you,
and that's why I'm here,

00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:43,283
to say I want to have
a partner that has done it.

00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,651
You guys have done it.

00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:46,486
And at the end of the day,
it's all about money.

00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:47,654
Right, Mr. Wonderful?

00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:49,089
That's so True,
my friend.

00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:50,490
I'm listening to you,
and you're saying,

00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:52,993
"look, I want to do retail,
I want to license images."

00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,295
I-I appreciate the fact
you have $500,000 in Sales.

00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:56,797
That's interesting.

00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:59,066
But the rest of it's moving
parts to me, and I hate retail,

00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:00,567
so I'm out.

00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:02,069

I think you're in love
with the retail business.

00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:08,442
I think you heard
a couple of great ideas

00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:10,210
to really make money
on this business,

00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:11,545

you're really listening,

Yes.

00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:10,257
This is basically
lunchables for a pet, right?

00:18:10,324 --> 00:18:11,725
Exactly.

00:18:11,792 --> 00:18:13,193
And it could be applied
to other pets as well, right?

00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,428
That is correct.

00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:15,896
So, Blake, why wouldn't I,

00:18:15,963 --> 00:18:18,465
as a dog owner,
simply take a baggie,

00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:21,168
throw some dried pet food in it,
and take it with me?

00:18:21,235 --> 00:18:22,803
What's the difference?

00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,938
What value are you adding
with that packaging?

00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:26,406
You could easily do that,

00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:27,741
and that's what most people do
right now all the time.

00:18:27,808 --> 00:18:29,243
So then why are you
solving a problem at all?

00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:32,179
This product probably has
no market whatsoever.

00:18:32,246 --> 00:18:34,515
Because you wouldn't have to
travel with the entire--

00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:35,716
All the extra stuff.

00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:36,850
No, but wouldn't I just--

00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:38,352
if they have
two different flavors

00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:40,320
of dried whatever it is
that they like,

00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:42,155
I'll throw both of those
into the bag,

00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:43,991
and when the dog's hungry,
I'll just

00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:46,426
open the bag,
let 'em eat it.

00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:48,395
It's not necessarily
for everyday use.

00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:49,730
It could be as a novelty,

00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,732
it could be for weekend use,
or just as a convenience,

00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,433
like if you're
gonna go Camping.

00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,735
Uh, you're going camping
for three days.

00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:55,903
Yeah, but I mean,
I'm questioning

00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,471
the viability
of your whole idea.

00:18:57,538 --> 00:18:59,907
I think there May be
zero value here.

00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:01,475
Absolutely Nobody
would buy this.

00:19:01,542 --> 00:19:03,177
I don't know why
anybody would need this.

00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:04,578

I-I got--I gotta tell you,
I have a dog.

00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:09,249
Uh, it's--It's not a bad idea.
It's a great way to package it.

00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,351
Is there a--some form
of patent on this?

00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:12,853
There is.
I have a patent pending

00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,655
and I've also trademarked
the name.

00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:16,290
You--you have
a patent on it?

00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:17,724
Pending.
I do, Indeed.

00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,126
Pending.
See, Blake, I think
it's a good idea,

00:19:19,193 --> 00:19:21,128
because when I travel
with the dog, right now

00:19:21,195 --> 00:19:22,996
you gotta grab this food, you
gotta throw it in a plastic bag.

00:19:23,063 --> 00:19:23,997
It's--It's just
a lot of work.

00:19:24,064 --> 00:19:26,767
The other thing
I really like is,

00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:28,135
for a large food company,

00:19:28,202 --> 00:19:30,404
it's just another way
for them to sell product.

00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,739
Have you made
any of those calls?

00:19:32,806 --> 00:19:34,107
I have tried personally
to contact

00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,109
a few different
pet food vendors,

00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:38,745
and I have not gotten anywhere
with my research.

00:19:38,812 --> 00:19:40,214
You know why?
'cause it's a worthless idea.
(laughs)

00:19:41,815 --> 00:19:43,717
You know what? You can just
kick him in the head.

00:19:43,784 --> 00:19:45,719
No, you don't.
And like I say,
I've presented this

00:19:45,786 --> 00:19:47,387
to hundreds of people...
Hey, rummy...

00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:49,523
and not anybody has said
that it was a worthless idea.
Kill.

00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,024
Well, now you found the truth.
I-I would like to say

00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:53,327
that many people say that
they would buy it themselves.

00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:55,629
Um, old and young,
uh, all--

00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:56,630
but have--
Has anybody bought it?

00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:57,731
No, this is
a prototype only.

00:19:57,798 --> 00:19:59,099
It's a prototype?

00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,201
It has not been marketed.
It has never been for sale.

00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:02,703

sell that for?

00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:04,271

00:26:54,162 --> 00:26:57,165
(Kevin) Okay, you got ten guys
that like ice cream.

00:26:57,231 --> 00:26:59,634
How many want to buy
a beer-Flavored ice cream?

00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,235
And you're talking guys, men?

00:27:01,302 --> 00:27:03,204
I don't care. Women, men,
dogs, cows, Goats.

00:27:03,271 --> 00:27:05,306
Um, 9 out of 10
want to try it,

00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:08,009
and, uh, 8--8 out of 10
want to try it again.

00:27:08,076 --> 00:27:10,311
I think you're wrong.

00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:13,348
Uh, n--I-I beg to differ.

00:27:13,414 --> 00:27:15,350
So what does it take
in terms of volume

00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:17,318
for you guys to be profitable?

00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:20,254
If we were to get, I would say,
probably 20 whole Foods.

00:27:20,321 --> 00:27:21,623
Dollars.

00:27:21,689 --> 00:27:22,924
Dollars.
Um...

00:27:22,991 --> 00:27:24,892
uh-Oh.
Uh-Oh.

00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:27,829
Between what we've invested
in it, w--I mean, $50,000.

00:27:27,895 --> 00:27:30,565
(Robert) Here's my--
My real issue.

00:27:30,632 --> 00:27:32,400
I think you gotta know
your numbers.

00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:35,036
I mean, you guys had
a VERY hard time

00:27:35,103 --> 00:27:37,138
answering my question,
O'Leary's question,

00:27:37,205 --> 00:27:38,973
cuban's question.

00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,708
And it made me think you guys
just met each other outside

00:27:40,775 --> 00:27:42,176
as you came down the hallway.
(laughs)

00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:43,177
(Jason)
We're ice cream makers.

00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:44,178
We're ice cream makers.

00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:45,413
(Robert) I hear you,

00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,748
but there are certain things
in every business,

00:27:46,814 --> 00:27:48,716
you gotta know
every morning when you wake up,

00:27:48,783 --> 00:27:50,218
and one of them is,

00:27:50,285 --> 00:27:52,787
what do I need to do
in order to break even.

00:27:52,854 --> 00:27:55,056
For that reason, I'm out.

00:27:56,524 --> 00:27:58,092
(mark)
You guys have challenges.

00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,862
You gotta sell thousands
and thousands of pints

00:28:00,928 --> 00:28:03,431
in order for us to even
think about getting a return.

00:28:03,498 --> 00:28:06,801
You might be better off going to
the big ice cream companies

00:28:06,868 --> 00:28:08,403
and licensing your product.

00:28:08,469 --> 00:28:10,905
That's your opportunity,
but I can't be an investor,

00:28:10,972 --> 00:28:14,809
because you'd have to sell
so many pints of ice cream,

00:28:14,876 --> 00:28:18,012
it would take too much capital,
so for that reason, I'm out.

00:28:20,081 --> 00:28:23,318
I'm out 'cause I think you guys
are ice cream bozos.

00:28:23,384 --> 00:28:25,720
No national Chain's
ever gonna pick this up.

00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:28,022
We respect your decision,

00:28:28,089 --> 00:28:29,624
but I think we're gonna
go forward.

00:28:29,691 --> 00:28:30,892
(Robert) So are we all out?

00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,226
Yeah, I think we're all out.
Good luck, guys.

00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:33,628
Thank you.

00:28:33,695 --> 00:28:36,297
Let's go get a beer.
Who's in?

00:28:36,364 --> 00:28:37,699
Did you like the ice cream?
Yes.

00:28:37,765 --> 00:28:39,233
I didn't.

00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,536
(Jason) We're ice cream makers.
We're not accountants.

00:28:41,602 --> 00:28:42,870
We were looking for somebody

00:28:42,937 --> 00:28:44,372
to kind of help us out
with that end of it,

00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:46,374
uh, so we could take care
of the ice cream end of it,

00:28:46,441 --> 00:28:47,875
which we know is awesome.

00:28:47,942 --> 00:28:49,677
And, uh, we're gonna
prove 'em wrong Anyway.

So we're out there riding

00:29:56,144 --> 00:30:00,214
In, uh, 2008, We both lost
our corporate jobs,

00:30:00,281 --> 00:30:03,217

"I have a great idea.

We have $172,000 in sales

00:30:47,462 --> 00:30:49,364
So you design it,

00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,099
and you send it,
and you outsource it?

00:30:51,165 --> 00:30:52,367
Mm-hmm. Yes.

No, we don't.

00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,116
We both have extensive
management background.

00:31:08,182 --> 00:31:12,287
We have been businesswomen
for over 25 years.

00:31:12,353 --> 00:31:14,055
Let me tell you,
that looks Good.

00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,190
Okay, so this is a 1-Year event

00:31:16,257 --> 00:31:17,692
Show me I can trust you

00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:19,093
What are you gonna do
with my money?

00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,928
Well, we're going
to Europe.

00:31:20,995 --> 00:31:23,665
That's not the right answer.
On a vacation?

00:31:23,731 --> 00:31:24,966
Wrong Answer.
Big-Time wrong.
(laughter)

00:31:25,033 --> 00:31:26,167
No, no, no, no, no.

00:31:26,234 --> 00:31:27,568
Here's the thing--
in the United States,

00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:29,771
There are 7 million
registered bikes.

00:31:29,837 --> 00:31:32,607
But the big market
for our product is in Europe,

00:31:32,674 --> 00:31:36,177
because you've got 35 million
registered riders there--

00:31:36,244 --> 00:31:38,346
That is a horrible,
horrible,

00:31:38,413 --> 00:31:39,514
horrible, horrible--

00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:42,216
did I say that was
a horrible answer?

00:31:42,283 --> 00:31:43,918
And I'll tell you why.

00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,353
How many people
are in your company?

00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,255
Two.
You're working out of
your house.

00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,523
Yep.

00:31:48,589 --> 00:31:50,525
What happens to your business
in your 25 stores

00:31:50,591 --> 00:31:53,094
when you guys are both in Europe
trying to figure everything out?

00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,596
When you grow a business,

00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:56,965
it's a babysitting process.

00:31:57,031 --> 00:31:58,399
It's like having a child,
right?
Mm-Hmm.

00:31:58,466 --> 00:32:00,368
You haven't even hired
your first employee,

00:32:00,435 --> 00:32:01,736
and you're already
leaving the country and--

00:32:01,803 --> 00:32:03,538
(Arlene) No, that's not
the case. That's not True.

00:32:03,604 --> 00:32:05,440
We have made a significant
number of contacts

00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,909
in the industry overseas.
Again, the same problem--

00:32:07,976 --> 00:32:09,677
they do the work for us.

00:32:09,744 --> 00:32:10,778
Are you profitable yet?

00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:12,580
Well, we would've been
profitable,

00:32:12,647 --> 00:32:14,983
except we went to Europe.

00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:16,951
Yeah, we've made a lot
of mistakes with our money.

00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:19,520
So, Arlene, now you want to make
a mistake on our dime?

00:32:19,587 --> 00:32:20,788
No, no, no, no.
See, that's the benefit.

00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:23,124
A lot of the mistakes
that we made,

00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,459
we will not make again.

00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:25,893
Okay, Desiree, you said
you put all your money in.

00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,096
How much was all of that
when you started?

00:32:28,162 --> 00:32:32,867
We invested, of our own money,
close to $400,000.

00:32:32,934 --> 00:32:34,602
How much do you have left?

00:32:34,669 --> 00:32:37,038
Less--a little less
than $100,000.

00:32:37,105 --> 00:32:39,340
Let me
ask you ladies something.

00:32:39,407 --> 00:32:40,541
Everybody agrees
the Product's good.

00:32:40,608 --> 00:32:42,677
Would you agree
to allow me to put

00:32:42,744 --> 00:32:44,445
an ankle bracelet
on each of you,

00:32:44,512 --> 00:32:46,614
and every time
you said "Europe,"

00:32:46,681 --> 00:32:47,915
you got a 50-Volt shock?

00:32:47,982 --> 00:32:49,083

I love motorcycles,

Daymond, what do you think

00:33:00,828 --> 00:33:04,165

the bigger Issue.

00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,199

the insane valuation?

00:33:05,266 --> 00:33:06,567

That's why
we need you.

00:41:07,181 --> 00:41:08,916
We burned through
that $400,00,

00:41:08,983 --> 00:41:11,019
and I take responsibility
to that,

00:41:11,085 --> 00:41:12,353
because I had a big dream

00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,889
that we could do this
where we have

00:41:14,956 --> 00:41:17,358
distributors interested
in us in Italy...

00:41:17,425 --> 00:41:18,359
All right.
In Europe.

00:41:18,426 --> 00:41:19,360
Okay, but--
(Robert) Arlene.

00:41:19,427 --> 00:41:20,662
Yeah?
The--the--

00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,196
my bad. My bad, Robert.
(daymond)
Arlene, just--

00:41:22,263 --> 00:41:24,165
Come on. Come back
to the table, baby!

00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:26,000
But there you are again!
There you are again!
(laughs)

00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:27,869
(daymond) rob, this--
400 grand. "My bad."

00:41:27,935 --> 00:41:29,570
I just pissed it away, right?
Yeah. No. I didn't do that.

00:41:29,637 --> 00:41:31,706
Hey, you know what, Arlene?

00:41:31,773 --> 00:41:34,342
$400,000 was a lot of money
to me when I didn't have any.

00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,010
It's still a lot of money!
It's still
a lot of money to me.

00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:37,578
It's still a lot
of money.

00:41:37,645 --> 00:41:38,746
I can't do it 'cause you're
throwing that money away.

00:41:38,813 --> 00:41:41,115
If daymond wants to throw
his money away,

00:41:41,182 --> 00:41:42,116
I'm gonna let him do it.

00:41:42,183 --> 00:41:43,418
I'm out.

00:41:43,484 --> 00:41:44,852
Ugh.
Ohh.

00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:45,853
We--

00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,088
We were willing to,

00:41:47,155 --> 00:41:50,391
you know,
refocus our business.

00:41:50,458 --> 00:41:52,427
We are willing to--
to grow our business.

00:41:52,493 --> 00:41:54,729
We actually have
a marketing plan for the U.S.

00:41:54,796 --> 00:41:55,897
(daymond) guys, listen.

00:41:57,131 --> 00:41:59,267
Robert's out.

00:42:01,135 --> 00:42:03,504
But I got good news
for you. I'm in.

00:42:03,571 --> 00:42:04,806
Whoo!
Aah!

00:42:04,872 --> 00:42:06,741
I can't believe it.
Damn.

00:42:06,808 --> 00:42:07,976
Thank you!
Oh, my goodness!

00:42:08,042 --> 00:42:10,311
All right, so now
I'm betting on you guys.

00:42:10,378 --> 00:42:11,546
Don't make me look bad.

00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:12,647
We won't.
Not a chance.

00:42:12,714 --> 00:42:13,648
All right.
We won't.

00:42:13,715 --> 00:42:15,116
Thank you.
Thank you, sharks!

00:42:15,183 --> 00:42:16,250
(mark)
Congratulations, ladies.

00:42:16,317 --> 00:42:17,518
(laughing)

00:42:17,585 --> 00:42:18,753
(Arlene) God!

00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:19,921
(Barbara) You're my hero.

00:42:19,988 --> 00:42:21,489
Whoo-Hoo!
Oh, god.

00:42:21,556 --> 00:42:23,157
(laughing) We got it.

00:42:23,224 --> 00:42:25,159
I'm glad we had
our protective armor on,

00:42:25,226 --> 00:42:27,562
because we sure took
a beating out there,

00:42:27,629 --> 00:42:29,464
but at the end of the day,
we got what we wanted.

00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:31,599
And we wanted a deal
with daymond,

00:42:31,666 --> 00:42:33,568
and we're ready to go.
