We opened four stores in Florida
all in the same time period,

00:05:10,077 --> 00:05:11,979
and, um,
with that investment,

00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:15,649
we--we didn't have
a profitable year yet.

00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:17,918
Why so many at once?
It seems very, very aggressive.

00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,052
Yes,
in different territories.
Well, that's a very--

00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:21,555
That's a very good question,
but when we knew

00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:23,557
we were expanding that far,

00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:26,059
for logistics purposes alone
and for branding purposes,

00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:29,429
we knew we had to have
more than one location.

00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,031
Help me understand.
You have the eight in indiana,

00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:33,033
and then you move
to Florida.

00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,637

or is it still a drag?

And what your plans are
for those units.

00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:38,939
Well, two of the stores
in Florida

00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,974
are still not a year old,
and I think

00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,777
what we underestimated
as a business was that

00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,613
we didn't realize how popular
we were in indiana.

00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,750

we were.

00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:50,918

All right, so you're saying

losing a lot of money?

00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,025

their first year, yes.

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,768
like blondie's cookies,
absolutely nothing.

00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:51,371
Number 3,
we have systems of 26 years.

00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:53,607
I didn't start doing this
yesterday.

00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:56,710
I have been doing it for
26 years in the mid--Midwest,

00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:59,046
which is
an extremely tough market.

00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:00,747
And fourth, you have me,

00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:04,718
one of the hardest-Working
c.E.O.S I know.

00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:06,520
I'm out.

00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:09,323
Okay. I understand.

00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:12,025
Blondie, I think you've done
a phenomenal job

00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:14,094
of creating a brand.

00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:16,697
I think you gotta--
You gotta pull in the horses

00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:21,401
and focus on the core,
uh, not the remote locations.

00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:22,669
I'm out.

00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:27,941
Mrs. Fields grow--Grew

00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,576
to millions and millions
of dollars

00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:31,345
before they were purchased
by a larger company.

00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:33,647
We have the best product
on the market,

00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:34,915
and we know
what we're doing.

00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:37,518
We're
a proven turnkey operation.

00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:40,153
I'm not asking you to come in
and run my business.

00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:44,458
I know how to do cookies,
but you know business,

00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,493
and you know how
to go to those next levels,

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,098
and you know how to
get past those plateaus.

00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:54,601
You know, blondie...
(sighs) I don't like you.

00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:56,503
(laughs)

00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,505
Because of you,
I'm gonna be in the gym

00:08:58,572 --> 00:08:59,907
for about three hours
tonight.

00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,108
(Brenda and Barbara laugh)

00:09:01,175 --> 00:09:02,943
These cookies are good.

00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,378
Thank you.

00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:06,713
Where your business is
right now, you went for it,

00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,549
and it hasn't quite turned out
the way you planned,

00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:10,517
but that's created
a significant problem

00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:13,921
for an investor,
because my only hope

00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:16,924
of getting my money back is
completely dependent

00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,592
on what happens in Florida.

00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:20,360
Right.
You are all-in, right?

00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:23,597
Well, how many businesses
expand 45% in one year?

00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:26,900
Well, look, what happened is
what happened, right,

00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,702
but you're asking me
to put good money

00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:31,405
to help support
what you already are--

00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:32,773
Is telling us
is bad money...

00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,508
right.
And that's the problem.

00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:37,110
Well, the numbers
we talked about--
blondie, I'm out.

00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,851
Barbara? Daymond?

00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:50,591
I tasted the cookies.
Blown away.

00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,426
Thank you.
I'm--I'm obsessed
with them already.

00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:53,527
Thank you.

00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:55,262
Then I started becoming
mesmerized by you.

00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:59,199
I believe you're the brand.
But 3% for $200,000,

00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,768
and you're valuing
the business at $7 million--

00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:03,437
No, not--More than that
with debt.

00:10:03,504 --> 00:10:04,438
$9 million, I think,
she's--
More than that with debt,

00:10:04,505 --> 00:10:05,739
So, okay, $9 million.

00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:08,876
I'm out.

00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:12,513
Okay. I appreciate it.
Thank you.

00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:14,214
I'm just gonna tell you
what I really think,

00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:15,749
which is a hard thing
to do...
Sure.

00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:17,651
Because you're like
a little bubbly Angel here.

00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:18,652
That's okay.

00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:20,420
I feel like, uh,

00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:23,457
you've made a <i>big </i>mistake
in opening the Florida stores,

00:10:23,524 --> 00:10:26,193
and I think on some level,
you know it,

00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,528
but what's gonna work
against you,

00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:29,663
'cause I know--I have
a good share of that in myself--

00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,698
Is your refusal to quit.

00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:34,368
That, plus your honor.

00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,270
I could tell right away,
you're the type of person,

00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:37,604
you commit to something,
you--You mean it.

00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:40,107
Sure. Our balance sheet's
not looking good

00:10:40,174 --> 00:10:41,842
because we pay our bills.
No.

00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:43,777
We don't bow out.
And you'll pay your bills

00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:44,945
until you die
on your own sword.

00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:46,380
That's right.

00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:47,347
I'm out.

00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:49,082
Okay. Appreciate that.

00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,752
By the way, I'm gonna eat
All those cookies, so... sorry.

00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,654
(chuckles)
They're all for you guys.
I'm a customer.

00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,655
Thank you.
Thanks, blondie. Good luck.

00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:57,024
Thank you.

00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,327
I'm a little disappointed,
but I've never given up

00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:03,530
in 26 years,
and I'm not giving up now.

00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:04,998
We have the best product.

00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:07,534
It's all about the cookie
at blondie's.

I'm seeking $500,000 in exchange

00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,304
Anyone working out,

00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:47,508
be it at home, in the gym,
or in a training camp,

00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:49,009
wants to see results.

00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:51,745
That's why they do it.
But to get results,

00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:55,115
you need to push yourself,
and more often than not,

00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:57,518

Viewsport
sweat activated technology

00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:07,027
is built into the fabric
of t-Shirts, so when you sweat,

00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:09,663
a secret logo appears
in the shirt.

00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,198
It's motivation...
(chuckles)

00:12:11,265 --> 00:12:12,799
Through perspiration.
Mm.

Here's how it works.

00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,937

His shirt just became
personal motivation,

00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,982
and you can customize
any of these shirts

00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:33,720

viewsport's gonna do it

The market is crying out for
something new, and we have it.

00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:46,667
We just need your relationships

What are the sales?

This year we've done
$140,000,

00:12:50,204 --> 00:12:52,906
80% of which has been done
in the last 3 months.

00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:54,942
Can I see one?

00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:57,444
Sure. How about this one?

00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:59,446
So you can see it
and appreciate it.

00:12:59,513 --> 00:13:01,548
And is this your technology
you invented,

00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,250
or did you license it?

00:13:03,317 --> 00:13:05,485
No. This is my technology.
I invented it,

00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:07,554
and it's patent pending
right now.

00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:08,589
How did you invent it?

00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:09,756
My background's
in chemistry.

00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:12,693
I was in medical school,
and I was working out...

00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,828
(Robert chuckles)
And I saw sweat patterns
on my shirt.

00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:17,431
(chuckles) I thought it would
be kind of a novel idea

00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:19,867
to create messaging
out of it,

00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:22,169
so I did
significant research,

00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:23,504
and I dropped out
of medical school

00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,838
to pursue this.
Did you quit
medical school?

00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:26,673
I did.
You're doing this
full-Time?

00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,774
Full-time.

00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:29,576
So...
it's an interesting idea.

00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:30,944
I'm just trying
to get my mind around

00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:34,314
whether that would cause me
to buy the shirt.

00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:36,149
It's not the shirt.
It's the technology.

00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:37,918
Think of it as a new medium
for branding and messaging.

00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:39,720
So is your strategy
to license the technology

00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:41,922
to players
in the apparel business?

00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:44,391
Uh, to license the technology
not only to apparel players,

00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:45,926
but we can integrate
the technology

00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:47,528
into other textiles.

00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:50,497
So the $140,000 you've sold,
has that been licensing?

00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:53,500
No, what we've done is, we have
full decoration services that--

00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:55,569
We take
other people's shirts,

00:13:55,636 --> 00:13:57,504
like high school teams,
college teams,

00:13:57,571 --> 00:13:59,406
we put this chemical
on the shirt.

00:13:59,473 --> 00:14:00,941
It's subsequently applied
to the shirt,

00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:02,609
and then the shirt's ready
to go to be sold.

00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,311
Ben--
You have to sweat to see
the imprint.

00:14:04,378 --> 00:14:06,647
No, you don't. That's the beauty
of the technology.

00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:08,348
Mm-hmm.
Think kids in water parks.

00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:10,017
Spray the shirt down,

00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,485
and secret logos
or graphics appear.
Well, then you have

00:14:11,552 --> 00:14:13,554
to be wet to actually see
what follows...
you have to be wet.

00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,522
Ben, would
this model work...
and--Mm.

00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:17,658
If you simply gave me
the chemical

00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:19,593
or a way to make
the chemical? Like--
That's the endgame.

00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,428
We want to license
this technology out.
Do you need to have--

00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:22,696
Have you approached
any companies

00:14:22,763 --> 00:14:23,931
about a licensing deal?

00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:25,365
We have.

00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:27,000
Hurley is very interested
in the product right now.

00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:29,670
I have a question about
the sweat factor.

00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:32,606
I can work out for two hours
and barely sweat.

00:14:32,673 --> 00:14:34,241
How hard do you have
to sweat--

00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:35,509
You're not working out
hard enough.

00:14:35,576 --> 00:14:36,810
A 20-Minute workout
for an average individual

00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:38,111
will produce the results
that you need.

00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:39,413
So the logo goes away
pretty quickly, Ben.

00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:41,615
Yeah. Unfortunately,
you sweat from the inside,

00:14:41,682 --> 00:14:42,616
so when you spray it
from the outside,

00:14:42,683 --> 00:14:43,617
the effect isn't as good.

00:14:43,684 --> 00:14:45,519
Okay, so let's see it work.

00:14:45,586 --> 00:14:48,822
(spritzes)

00:14:51,425 --> 00:14:53,160
I don't--I'm sorry.

00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:54,528
I don't know.
I'm not seeing a whole lot.

00:14:54,595 --> 00:14:56,096
I don't know there.
(chuckles) Yeah, um...

00:14:56,163 --> 00:14:58,432
(chuckles) I--
have you had any complaints
from customers that

00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:00,400
it wasn't as visible--
Not at all. This is--
This never happens.

00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:03,303
This is falling apart
right here.

00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,838
Come on, Ben.
You got one foot in the tank

00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,573
and another
on a banana Peel.

00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,275
There you can see.

00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:09,810
See, I still can't see
the, uh...
well, I can read it.

00:15:09,877 --> 00:15:11,512
"stronger. Be stronger."
The "stronger" Part

00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:14,348
doesn't come out
as strong.
Ben, let me see it.

00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,183
Is the material a cotton?
Can you make that--

00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,651
can I do it
on 100% cotton?

00:15:17,718 --> 00:15:19,653
That's a polyester.
We could do it on 100% cotton.

00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,922
Ben, can that secondary word
"Stronger" be in black?

00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:23,524
Can it pop like
your original logo?

00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,026
It's all monochromatic.
I'm working on colors right now.

00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:27,394
No.

00:15:27,461 --> 00:15:28,562
So what is
the half a million dollars--

00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:30,364
What are you gonna
use it on?

00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:34,001
Well, the idea is to drive
awareness of the technology,

00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:36,503
go--Having people go
into the nikes, the hurleys

00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,005
of the world.
A sales team.

00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:40,941
A sales team, and when people
understand the technology

00:15:41,008 --> 00:15:42,342
and the word gets out,
it's organic growth.

00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:44,511
I know,
but we're paying right now,

00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:46,580
and they don't know
anything now about it.

00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:48,315
I know, but--
y-You don't see a problem
with that?

00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:50,350
No, I-I understand,
But the reality is,

00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:53,020
if you look at our sales
and you annualize them,

00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:54,354
we're looking at about
a half a million

00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:55,556
by the end of the year.

00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,224
So then you wouldn't need
our money.

00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,692
No, but I do.
I need your relationships.

00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:01,428
So I'm working for my money,
once I give it to you.

00:16:01,495 --> 00:16:02,763
You see the technology.
There's a value in this.

00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:04,264
Obviously you see
something here.

00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:05,933
I think--I think you do.

00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:08,402
I'm out.

00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,838
We just got a p.O.
For the U.S. Naval academy.

00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:12,439
They're gonna order
1,500 shirts now,

00:16:12,506 --> 00:16:14,174
1,500 shirts
in the next month.

00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:15,409
1,500?

00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,945
Ben, you're a chemist.
Let's reverse engineer

00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:20,314
the equation
for this value, okay?
(mouths word)

00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,115
What should I be making
in a company

00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:24,518
that I want to sell somebody
for $2 1/2 million?

00:16:24,585 --> 00:16:26,153
$500,000.
What do you--Right.

00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,921
Yeah.
How much are you making?

00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,656
We did $140,000 so far.

00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:30,691
You're making squat.

00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:32,726
He's charging you
25 times...

00:16:32,793 --> 00:16:34,695
(speaks indistinctly)
I'm looking for a partnership.
I'm looking for somebody

00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:36,730
that's gonna help
This business grow.

00:16:36,797 --> 00:16:38,198
Well, see, but that--
You've identified
This is a great technology.

00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:40,234
You're right. No, I get
that, Ben. I get that, right?

00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,602
Yeah.
So part of your role

00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,505
in coming into the shark tank is
being able to strategize,

00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:47,274
and when you ask
for too much money...

00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:49,142
what you need is us.
Absolutely.

00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:54,414
Because you strategized
incorrectly, I'm out.

00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:56,817
Ben, when I hear
a valuation like this,

00:16:56,884 --> 00:16:58,318
I get a little insulted.

00:16:58,385 --> 00:17:02,322
Why would I ever give you money
at a value that guarantees

00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:03,724
I'll never get a return?

00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,526
Here's the thing.
It's a $54 billion industry.

00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:07,194
The biggest players--

00:17:07,261 --> 00:17:08,428
Every guy comes in here
and says that.

00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:10,163
All right, but nike has
a 4% market share...

00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,598
<i>Everybody </i>says that.
Highly fragmented.

00:17:11,665 --> 00:17:13,000
You're a long line of guys...
if we had one--

00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:14,935
That have made
this strategic mistake.

00:17:15,002 --> 00:17:17,004
I'm very frustrated
'cause I like the idea,

00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,339
but then I see stupidity.
I really do.

00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:23,143
I see somebody's who's arrogant
and insulted me financially,

00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,812
which I take
a lot of offense in.

00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:28,448
I'm out.

00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:32,519
Ben, my reaction is--
is This is too monochromatic.

00:17:32,586 --> 00:17:33,654
You can't read it.

00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,356
It takes too much sweat
to actually get the big bonus

00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:38,525
of reading something
on your chest, so I'm out

00:17:38,592 --> 00:17:41,662
because the product is
terrible, I think, honestly.

00:17:44,932 --> 00:17:47,301
You know, Ben, I'm not sold
on the product.

00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:50,170
Uh, I do think
it's a little bit gimmicky.

00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:51,672
I'm out.

00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:56,310
I appreciate your time.
Thank you very much.

00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:59,746
I asked for too much money,
and I'm paying the price now,

00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:01,348
but I think
they were shortsighted,

00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:03,483
'cause this technology is
revolutionary.

00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:33,647
Hi.
My name is mark Sullivan,

00:18:33,714 --> 00:18:38,418
and I'm an inventor
with over 1,000 inventions,

00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:41,421
and the technology
I'm offering you today

00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:43,524
is the Sullivan generator.

00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:46,860
For only $1 million,
I am offering

00:18:46,927 --> 00:18:49,763
10% of my generator.

00:18:51,064 --> 00:18:53,000
This is
an electric generator

00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:56,170
which harnesses
the spin of the earth.

00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:59,306
It works by taking
in salt water.

00:18:59,373 --> 00:19:01,441
It processes the water

00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:05,212
and leaves behind
the mineral precipitates.

00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:08,382
The water vapor is then
delivered to a vortex chamber,

00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:14,621
where the coriolis effect
spins this into a hurricane,

00:19:14,688 --> 00:19:18,759
which drives the turbines,
which makes electricity.

00:19:20,127 --> 00:19:22,029
The waste products are

00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:27,067
the mineral precipitates
manganese and gold.

00:19:27,134 --> 00:19:28,302
What?

00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:29,303
Gold.

00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:30,938
Gold?
Gold.

00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:31,939
G-O-L-D?

00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:33,006
G-O-L-D.
Let him finish.

00:19:33,073 --> 00:19:35,475
We suck water in.

00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:37,477
We make it spin
really fast...

00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:38,645
right.

00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:40,047
And we produce electricity
on one hand...

00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:41,048
right.

00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:42,182
And gold bars
on the other.

00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:43,217
That's it.

00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:49,122
The waste products can be
$96 billion in gold,

00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:53,861
so we can have over 200
of these generators set up

00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:55,195
all over the world.

00:19:55,262 --> 00:20:00,133
They're, uh, controlled
over the internet.

00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,370
With your help
and your business acumen,

00:20:03,437 --> 00:20:07,608
together we can develop
this new technology

00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:14,515
and leave a lasting legacy
of goodness.

00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:17,351
Mark, how long are you
visiting earth?

00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:20,954
(mark C., Barbara, and Robert
laugh)

00:20:21,021 --> 00:20:22,022
What's your background, mark?

00:20:22,089 --> 00:20:24,625
I have degrees
in biomedical engineering

00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:26,093
and physics.

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,029
I've been working on This
for several years.

00:20:29,096 --> 00:20:32,766
You're the first that
I have presented this to,

00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,202
so you have
a great opportunity right now.

00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:38,172
What's going on
in that little tank?

00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:42,042
Well, this is just a model
to illustrate

00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:46,747
the force of the conservation
of angular momentum.

00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:49,116
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about

00:20:49,183 --> 00:20:53,120
or what you said,
so with that, I'm out.

00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:59,426
If your theory is correct,
would it not seem to make sense

00:20:59,493 --> 00:21:02,129
that in real-Life hurricanes,
there would be sprinkles

00:21:02,196 --> 00:21:04,064
of gold left somewhere?

00:21:04,131 --> 00:21:05,899
That's right.

00:21:05,966 --> 00:21:10,337
The gold is left
in the ocean.

00:21:10,404 --> 00:21:13,040
So if I went to a hurricane area
in the ocean,

00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:15,442
how much gold would I get out
of that salt water?

00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:20,247
We process
1 cubic mile of salt water,

00:21:20,314 --> 00:21:24,618
we're gonna get
1,500 tons of gold

00:21:24,685 --> 00:21:27,588
as a waste product.

00:21:27,654 --> 00:21:29,189
Yeah. Yeah,
but you've still got...
what?

00:21:29,256 --> 00:21:31,225
To be able to process
a cubic mile of--

00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:35,128
Of water--Of ocean water.
That's enormous.

00:21:35,195 --> 00:21:36,930
How big is
the entire machine?

00:21:36,997 --> 00:21:39,666
This is 100 feet tall.

00:21:41,435 --> 00:21:43,837
So you're creating
a synthetic hurricane

00:21:43,904 --> 00:21:47,140
and trapping it
in a 100-Foot-High tube.

00:21:47,207 --> 00:21:49,109
That's right.

00:21:49,176 --> 00:21:51,845
If I gave you
$1 million today,

00:21:51,912 --> 00:21:54,381
how long would it take
to build the first one?

00:21:54,448 --> 00:21:57,751
We would h--Be operational
in nine months.

00:21:57,818 --> 00:21:59,253
No way.
Way.

00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,421
My... Meter is going
through the roof.

00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:04,024
It's going, "Bing, Bing, Bing,
Bing, Bing, Bing, Bing."

00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:06,326
I'm out.

00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:10,998
What about
the other 999 inventions?

00:22:11,064 --> 00:22:13,834
Did you ever make any money
with those?

00:22:15,202 --> 00:22:20,340
My inventions are making
over $1 billion per year.

00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:23,310
Can you name one that
I would know?

00:22:23,377 --> 00:22:25,045
Artificial hearts,
artificial kidney--

00:22:25,112 --> 00:22:26,547
You invented
the artificial heart?

00:22:26,613 --> 00:22:29,216
It's a left ventricular
assist device.

00:22:29,283 --> 00:22:30,951
Do you get money
from that?

00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:32,252
I do get some royalties,

00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:34,922
and I get royalties
from my music.

00:22:36,123 --> 00:22:41,862
I write music. I design,
uh, clothing. I sew.

00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:45,065
(daymond, Robert,
and Kevin laugh)

00:22:45,132 --> 00:22:46,099
I want to know what
you sew.

00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:49,169
Leather,
and I sew ladies' skirts

00:22:49,236 --> 00:22:52,039
and vests and handbags.

00:22:52,105 --> 00:22:53,607

00:22:57,244 --> 00:22:58,779
(chuckles)

00:22:58,846 --> 00:23:00,013
It's a very fine line...
go ahead.

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,448
Of being a genius and crazy.
Yeah.

00:23:01,515 --> 00:23:02,816
I'm just asking you,

00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:06,920
has anybody ever said
to you, "you're crazy"?

00:23:06,987 --> 00:23:10,557
no, I've won
engineering awards.

00:23:10,624 --> 00:23:13,093
I don't smoke.
I don't drink.

00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,028
I'm thinking
maybe you should.

00:23:15,095 --> 00:23:16,530
(laughs)

00:23:16,597 --> 00:23:18,866
Mark, if I gave you
$50,000,

00:23:18,932 --> 00:23:21,101
and Kevin gave you
the other $950,000...

00:23:21,168 --> 00:23:22,636
(laughs)

00:23:22,703 --> 00:23:28,041
How much gold would we make
from the $50,000 machine?

00:23:28,108 --> 00:23:32,446
It would be determined
by the flow of water

00:23:32,513 --> 00:23:35,148
processed through
the generator.

00:23:35,215 --> 00:23:36,450
Mark, may I interrupt you?
That might be
the reason why--

00:23:36,517 --> 00:23:37,851
May I interrupt him
just a minute?

00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:39,052
Uh-huh. Yes, ma'am.

00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:40,988
I'm out.

00:23:43,657 --> 00:23:45,459
Look, mark, enough of this.
I made you a legitimate offer.

00:23:45,526 --> 00:23:46,627
I'll give you the...
(laughs)

00:23:46,693 --> 00:23:48,428
(chuckles)
I'll give you the $50,000

00:23:48,495 --> 00:23:51,465
if you can get O'Leary to
give you the other $950,000,

00:23:51,532 --> 00:23:52,866
'cause that man loves gold

00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:56,203
more than any other human being
I've ever met.

00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,471
Or I could just go buy
some gold

00:23:57,538 --> 00:23:59,173
with my $950,000.
(laughs
and speaks indistinctly)

00:23:59,239 --> 00:24:01,175
But that's not fun.
That's not fun.

00:24:01,241 --> 00:24:03,810
Look, mark,
it's very interesting,

00:24:03,877 --> 00:24:06,213
but most of it's
nutbar factor six.

00:24:07,681 --> 00:24:09,449
I'm out.

00:24:09,516 --> 00:24:12,519
Well, mark, you weren't able
to convince O'Leary,

00:24:12,586 --> 00:24:14,621
and <i>only </i>for that reason,

00:24:14,688 --> 00:24:17,157
I'm out, too.

00:24:18,592 --> 00:24:22,229
I-I guess you just didn't
get it, you know,

00:24:22,296 --> 00:24:25,866
but that can happen, and, uh,
this is the--the plight

00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:27,768
of the inventor.

00:24:27,835 --> 00:24:28,769
Good luck.

00:24:28,836 --> 00:24:30,103
Okay. Bye-Bye.

00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,638
This way, mark. This way.

00:24:31,705 --> 00:24:33,440
Thank you.

That guy was great.

Maybe we're just
too simple.

Maybe that was the best deal
in the tank this year.

00:24:42,282 --> 00:24:44,918
I think so, man.

In America, this is the land
of opportunity and innovation,

Kevin O'Leary only wanted

I would revolutionize

00:27:18,071 --> 00:27:20,140
I had just launched
the concept,

00:27:20,207 --> 00:27:23,010
but I had
had over $500,000 in sales

00:27:23,076 --> 00:27:25,479
in the first six months.

00:27:25,546 --> 00:27:29,516
Well, this year
I'm on track to sell

00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:33,253

and to commemorate
the occasion,

00:28:14,494 --> 00:28:18,298
I've bottled
a $1,000 bottle of wine

00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:19,967

knocking again.

a now-Proven technology

00:28:42,856 --> 00:28:45,492

for just yourself,

when the real opportunity was
to give the entire wine industry

00:28:49,897 --> 00:28:52,833
a license
of this exact technology

00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,636

be sold this way.

Instead of just making
$5 million,

00:28:57,971 --> 00:29:02,209
you could make $500 million,

drinking
a $2,000 bottle of wine,

00:29:04,711 --> 00:29:07,848

to help you out of your madness

00:29:07,915 --> 00:29:09,650
and your insanity.

Last time I was here...
it was my offer.

00:29:16,857 --> 00:29:22,996
You offered $600,000 for 51%
of the I.P. And the patents.

00:29:23,063 --> 00:29:24,798
And you know what?
I said it was a great deal.

00:29:24,865 --> 00:29:26,400
It was even more
than I would have offered.

00:29:26,466 --> 00:29:27,401
You screwed up.

00:29:27,467 --> 00:29:29,403

to you.

00:29:35,976 --> 00:29:40,214

00:29:48,055 --> 00:29:49,623
the value of the brand,

00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:51,625
and now I see someone
standing in front of you

00:29:51,692 --> 00:29:53,126
that's proven the value
of the brand...
James...

00:29:53,193 --> 00:29:54,828
(speaks indistinctly)
And the value
of the patents that

00:29:54,895 --> 00:29:58,165
you're really interested in
are now much more valuable.

00:29:58,232 --> 00:30:00,067
Uh, look, look,
when I last saw you,

00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:02,903
I said you were
a dead man walking

00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,004
and you were dead to me.

00:30:04,071 --> 00:30:07,241
Now are you a ghost
or are you real?

00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:11,011
You know what? I bottled
a $1,000 bottle of wine

00:30:11,078 --> 00:30:15,649
so you and I could go ahead
and put the past in the past.

00:30:15,716 --> 00:30:17,017
In the decision
to bottle this,

00:30:17,084 --> 00:30:19,987
I created a name for you
for this wine.

00:30:20,053 --> 00:30:21,421

00:30:28,862 --> 00:30:30,998
that's gonna help set you free.

00:30:31,064 --> 00:30:33,500

the technology

00:30:33,567 --> 00:30:36,803
to the largest three players
in the wine industry

00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,205

what you're doing...

00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,908
Mm-hmm.
'cause you love it.

00:30:40,974 --> 00:30:42,476
You'll pay me a royalty,

00:30:42,543 --> 00:30:44,411
of which you'll get 49%...
mm-hmm.

00:30:44,478 --> 00:30:48,549
And I will <i>quadriple</i>
your net worth in two quarters

00:30:48,615 --> 00:30:50,817
by simply taking this to people

00:30:50,884 --> 00:30:53,620
that have distribution
50 TIMES larger than you,

00:30:53,687 --> 00:30:55,822
and every time
they sell something,

00:30:55,889 --> 00:30:57,925

to the original offer.

00:30:58,992 --> 00:30:59,927
Yep.
Of course it is,

00:30:59,993 --> 00:31:02,062
'cause it's the right thing
to do.

00:31:03,664 --> 00:31:05,799
If my memory serves me
correctly,

00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:08,068

some wine the last time.

00:31:08,135 --> 00:31:09,837
Mm.
You know, try--

00:31:09,903 --> 00:31:11,638
Try passing wine out
this easily

00:31:11,705 --> 00:31:13,874

There you go.

00:31:13,941 --> 00:31:15,909

00:31:15,976 --> 00:31:17,878

Wait. Hold on a second.

Well, I wasn't interested
last time,

00:31:19,446 --> 00:31:20,747

thoroughly entertained

00:31:20,814 --> 00:31:22,816

00:31:22,883 --> 00:31:26,320
so I'm out,
but thanks for the wine.

00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:28,255
You're welcome.
James, I don't want to do battle
with you anymore.

I want to figure out how
to do business with you,

00:31:40,133 --> 00:31:42,836
because wineries are
a labor of love,

00:31:42,903 --> 00:31:44,371
and you are in love.

00:31:44,438 --> 00:31:45,539
I hate that business.

00:31:45,606 --> 00:31:48,008
I love the packaging business
you have.

00:31:48,075 --> 00:31:50,844
You have
a <i>huge </i>global opportunity,

00:31:50,911 --> 00:31:54,314
and I so much want to be
your partner in that.

00:31:54,381 --> 00:31:56,316
Look, I have
a better understanding

00:31:56,383 --> 00:31:59,620
than I did last time,
but I'm still not comfortable

00:31:59,686 --> 00:32:03,423
that a $6 million valuation,
even with the m-Marginal value

00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:07,261
of the intellectual property,
is worth the investment.

00:32:07,327 --> 00:32:09,229
You need to start telling us
that you're negotiable

00:32:09,296 --> 00:32:10,764
on the equity portion.

00:32:10,831 --> 00:32:14,268
Very well said. I-I agree that
we are here to negotiate.

00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:15,869
I think it's
really important for you

00:32:15,936 --> 00:32:19,006
to take some of the information
that I have more seriously,

00:32:19,072 --> 00:32:21,842
that I-I, at this point,
am an expert.

00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:24,811
No one in--in the world today
knows wine by the glass

00:32:24,878 --> 00:32:26,813
in the marketplace
like I do.

00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,049
I agree,
so what's it gonna take?

00:32:29,116 --> 00:32:30,517
What are we gonna do here?

00:32:30,584 --> 00:32:33,921
Give--Give me a chance
to explain the valuation, okay?

00:32:33,987 --> 00:32:37,624
Most national brands,
which we are becoming,

00:32:37,691 --> 00:32:41,228
sell for 2 1/2 to 3 times
the gross dollar value.

00:32:41,295 --> 00:32:43,230
When you just sell a brand,
then it shifts over to--
but you're not there yet.

00:32:43,297 --> 00:32:44,831
You're not there yet,
'cause you're--You're--
You're not there yet.

00:32:44,898 --> 00:32:46,166
When will I be there?
Look--

00:32:46,233 --> 00:32:47,267
after you've done--
One more year.

00:32:47,334 --> 00:32:48,302
No, no.
But you're not.

00:32:48,368 --> 00:32:49,903
I just feel like...
James, you know...

00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,872
(speaks indistinctly)
When you just came
in here again,

00:32:51,939 --> 00:32:53,807
I was happy to see you
for some reason,

00:32:53,874 --> 00:32:55,876
like, "ohh,"
like an old friend...

00:32:55,943 --> 00:32:56,877
mm.

00:32:56,944 --> 00:32:57,878
And he got
a new haircut...

00:32:57,945 --> 00:32:59,046
(chuckles)

00:32:59,112 --> 00:33:00,814
But as I'm listening
and listening,

00:33:00,881 --> 00:33:03,417
I'm having the same
visceral reaction to you.

00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:06,420
For some reason,
and I hope you take it well,

00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:09,957
I didn't like you then,
and I don't like you now...

00:33:10,023 --> 00:33:11,225
But take it well.

00:33:11,291 --> 00:33:13,927
But I don't where
that's coming from.

00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:16,964
I just have to say
I'm out.

00:33:18,832 --> 00:33:22,870
I'm not arguing that
you see it at $6 million,

00:33:22,936 --> 00:33:26,573
but you have to see that
we see it at something less.

00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,808
Potentially there's
somewhere in the middle

00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:30,878
that we can meet,
but we're asking you

00:33:30,944 --> 00:33:34,014
to start to move the needle
and start to move the valuation

00:33:34,081 --> 00:33:36,817
so that we can respond.
Normally we don't do that.

00:33:36,884 --> 00:33:38,819
Normally we say, "you know what?
We're just gonna tell you,"

00:33:38,886 --> 00:33:40,921
but you know
what you're doing.

00:33:40,988 --> 00:33:42,089
You're very aware
of your industry.

00:33:42,155 --> 00:33:43,824
You're very aware of
the components of your business,

00:33:43,891 --> 00:33:45,559
so we're asking you.

00:33:45,626 --> 00:33:49,930
It sounds like you guys have
an interest in this, right?

00:33:49,997 --> 00:33:52,833
If we can work on a valuation,
we may be able to make

00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,801
a deal here, correct?
Which, uh,
I've been saying for...

00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:56,637
a long time.
Too many times.

00:33:56,703 --> 00:33:57,638
(chuckles) Yeah.

00:33:57,704 --> 00:33:58,839
You've tortured me so long,

00:33:58,906 --> 00:34:00,407
I'm gonna put an offer
out anyways.

00:34:00,474 --> 00:34:03,810
I'll do the $300,000 for 12%,

00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:05,812
'cause that's exactly
what you're worth right now.

00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:09,650
So you're saying the company's
worth $2 1/2 million today?

00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:11,318
That's exactly
what it's worth.

00:34:11,385 --> 00:34:15,222
You have something of tremendous
potential here globally.

00:34:15,289 --> 00:34:17,824
At some point, I know
I'll be able to convince you

00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:20,227
to set it free,
and you'll make so much money,

00:34:20,294 --> 00:34:23,764
you can kick back
on the copa hillside and say,

00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:24,898
"Kevin O'Leary was right.

00:34:24,965 --> 00:34:27,768
I'm so <i>lucky </i>to have him
as a partner."

00:34:27,835 --> 00:34:28,836
That's what's gonna happen,

00:34:28,902 --> 00:34:31,205
and my ticket
to entry is $300,000.

00:34:31,271 --> 00:34:33,240
All right.
You beat me into a pulp.

00:34:33,307 --> 00:34:35,209
Give me the good stuff.
I can't take this anymore.
Wow.

00:34:35,275 --> 00:34:37,277
Before you make
a decision...

00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,815
♪♪♪

00:34:46,453 --> 00:34:50,290

'cause that's exactly what
you're worth right now.

00:35:03,437 --> 00:35:06,173
Before you make a decision,

00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,674
I'm gonna try to change
his mind on something.

00:35:07,741 --> 00:35:09,209
W--Do you have anybody
you can call that you know,

00:35:09,276 --> 00:35:11,411
or you gotta go
to the bathroom or anything?

00:35:11,478 --> 00:35:13,747
I do have someone to call.

00:35:13,814 --> 00:35:14,882
Go make your phone call,

00:35:14,948 --> 00:35:16,216
'cause we need a moment.
Okay. All right.

00:35:16,283 --> 00:35:18,385
Okay?
Okay. Thank you.

00:35:21,688 --> 00:35:24,791
12% isn't a whole lot of skin
in the game. That's my problem.

00:35:24,858 --> 00:35:26,426
That's my issue with it.

00:35:26,493 --> 00:35:27,895
Right. That's my problem.

00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:30,063
I think we offer him
more money

00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:33,800
at a slightly lower valuation
among three of us...

00:35:33,867 --> 00:35:35,369
mm.
I like it.

00:35:35,435 --> 00:35:37,971
So we get more equity,
more in the upside, right?

00:35:38,038 --> 00:35:39,740
Why not try for 30%, mark,
so we get 10% each?

00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:41,475
I don't think he'll go for it,
but we can negotiate.
But try that.

00:35:41,542 --> 00:35:43,243
(Jim) I think they're
not appreciating

00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:46,413
you've got a proven technology,
a proven product.

00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,748
You've proven
there's a market,

00:35:47,814 --> 00:35:49,249
and when I started
Sam Adams,

00:35:49,316 --> 00:35:51,451
everybody thought it was
a dumb idea,

00:35:51,518 --> 00:35:52,920
and nobody would invest,

00:35:52,986 --> 00:35:54,922
and I only got, like,
lowball offers,

00:35:54,988 --> 00:35:56,890
and look where
Sam Adams is today.

00:35:56,957 --> 00:35:58,725
Passion will take you
a long way.

00:35:58,792 --> 00:35:59,960
Watch what he does
when he comes back.

00:36:00,027 --> 00:36:03,463
He's gonna be
complicated again.

00:36:05,465 --> 00:36:07,067
James, who did you call?

00:36:07,134 --> 00:36:08,202
I called Jim Koch.

00:36:08,268 --> 00:36:09,970
He's the founder
of Samuel Adams.

00:36:10,037 --> 00:36:13,407
He basically the--the father
of craft brewing in America,

00:36:13,473 --> 00:36:15,075
and Jim's been instrumental

00:36:15,142 --> 00:36:17,211
in--in bringing my company
to this level.

00:36:17,277 --> 00:36:18,245
What did he say to you?

00:36:18,312 --> 00:36:20,380
Jim basically wanted
to make sure that,

00:36:20,447 --> 00:36:22,916
whoever I'm becoming,
uh, a partner with,

00:36:22,983 --> 00:36:24,952
that they share in the dream,
they understand the vision,

00:36:25,018 --> 00:36:26,420
and they understand
the possibilities.

00:36:26,486 --> 00:36:28,222
Is he an, uh,
an investor in the company

00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,423
or an EQUITY owner
in the company?

00:36:29,489 --> 00:36:30,624
Jim's an advisor.

00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:31,959
An advisor. He doesn't have
any equity at all?

00:36:32,025 --> 00:36:33,160
No equity.

00:36:33,227 --> 00:36:34,161
Then why didn't he just
give you the money

00:36:34,228 --> 00:36:35,662
for your extra line
that you need?

00:36:35,729 --> 00:36:37,831
The best advice is gonna come
from someone who's not vested

00:36:37,898 --> 00:36:38,899
in your company.

00:36:38,966 --> 00:36:40,167
You know,
I really respect Koch.

00:36:40,234 --> 00:36:41,502
He's a legend
in the beverage industry.

00:36:41,568 --> 00:36:45,339
No question. But he's not
spending his money right here.

00:36:45,405 --> 00:36:49,209
So what did he tell you to do
with the $300,000 for 12%

00:36:49,276 --> 00:36:51,044
that Kevin offered you?

00:36:51,111 --> 00:36:53,647
You know, uh, basically,
it's--It's half the price

00:36:53,714 --> 00:36:56,049
of what the value
of--Of my company is,

00:36:56,116 --> 00:36:59,887
and he--He recommended that,
if I'm interested

00:36:59,953 --> 00:37:03,957
in trying to have a partner
as established as mark cuban,

00:37:04,024 --> 00:37:07,261
that it would be valuable to me
to pay additionally,

00:37:07,327 --> 00:37:11,632
above what I'm asking for
for an investment, of 3%,

00:37:11,698 --> 00:37:16,336
so $300,000 for 8%
of the company.

00:37:17,738 --> 00:37:18,805
That's your counter?

00:37:18,872 --> 00:37:20,107
That's my counter.

00:37:22,109 --> 00:37:24,211
Mark cuban's not interested
in that.

00:37:24,278 --> 00:37:27,347
And tell me why, mark.

00:37:27,414 --> 00:37:29,216
Because it's not enough skin
in the game.

00:37:29,283 --> 00:37:30,751
Because you want
the value of the sharks

00:37:30,817 --> 00:37:32,819
and what we bring
to the table,

00:37:32,886 --> 00:37:34,488
and that's an effort...

00:37:34,555 --> 00:37:35,956
Mm-hmm.
Right?

00:37:36,023 --> 00:37:37,224
Just like you've created
a valuation...

00:37:37,291 --> 00:37:38,225
Yeah.
We have our own valuations

00:37:38,292 --> 00:37:40,227
of our time
and our effort as well,

00:37:40,294 --> 00:37:44,198
and what I'm saying--
It's just not worth it.

00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:45,399
What I suggested
and they agreed with was that

00:37:45,465 --> 00:37:47,968
we need to get significant skin
in the game,

00:37:48,035 --> 00:37:50,637
but it's worth putting in
more money to get it,

00:37:50,704 --> 00:37:55,175
so what we suggested was
$600,000 for 30%,

00:37:55,242 --> 00:37:58,312
because that's $200,000 apiece,
10% equity apiece,

00:37:58,378 --> 00:38:00,647
three rock stars
to help support you

00:38:00,714 --> 00:38:04,318
and build your brand,
and you still retain 70%,

00:38:04,384 --> 00:38:07,054
so you get significant amounts
of leverage,

00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,224
and you have the capital,
should you need it, to expand

00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:13,427
into other product lines
to fund your growth.

00:38:13,493 --> 00:38:15,295
Twice the money you came here
looking for.

00:38:17,331 --> 00:38:19,266
I agree that having
more skin in the game

00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:21,768
makes a lot more sense
for you guys. I agree that

00:38:21,835 --> 00:38:25,739
that could be a greater value
and asset to my company.

00:38:25,806 --> 00:38:29,176
Does it get us a deal
in the stadium next year,

00:38:29,243 --> 00:38:30,410
in the Dallas mavericks?

00:38:30,477 --> 00:38:31,712
It gets you first crack.

00:38:31,778 --> 00:38:33,380
I can't make a promise
just because we have

00:38:33,447 --> 00:38:35,749
a service organization
that I have to go through.

00:38:35,816 --> 00:38:37,317
Uh-huh.
But when we were talking,

00:38:37,384 --> 00:38:38,919
you know, I own
the landmark theatres,

00:38:38,986 --> 00:38:42,222
and quite a few of them sell
alcohol and single-Serve wine,

00:38:42,289 --> 00:38:46,159
and the bigger theatres serving
Alcohol makes perfect sense.

00:38:46,226 --> 00:38:47,461
Yeah.

00:38:47,528 --> 00:38:50,264
Why can't...

00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:52,599
the--
You're talking yourself out
of a sale.

00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:54,201
You need to make a decision.

00:38:54,268 --> 00:38:56,336
Don't do this again, James.

00:38:58,438 --> 00:38:59,339
James, you've done something

00:38:59,406 --> 00:39:02,042
nobody in the tank
has ever done.

00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:06,647
You've been given
the American dream to come back.

00:39:06,713 --> 00:39:10,217
Who's--Who's in on this?
It's you, you, and you?

00:39:10,284 --> 00:39:11,418
Yes, sir.

00:39:11,485 --> 00:39:12,252
All three.

00:39:12,319 --> 00:39:14,021
(sighs)

00:39:15,656 --> 00:39:19,626
Kevin, if I get that phone call
from you all the time that says,

00:39:19,693 --> 00:39:21,962
"We've gotta
split this company up..."
No.

00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:24,198
James, mark and I will
keep Kevin in line. Don't worry.

00:39:24,264 --> 00:39:26,300
You've convinced me
from the very get-Go

00:39:26,366 --> 00:39:28,669
because you went
from $500,000 to $5 million,

00:39:28,735 --> 00:39:30,404
and then $12 million next year.

00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:32,706
You were right
about that concept.

00:39:32,773 --> 00:39:34,641
You need to make a decision
right now

00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:36,677
on what you want to do.

00:39:36,743 --> 00:39:40,280
I wanna be partners
with you guys...

00:39:41,481 --> 00:39:45,152
But if I trade my company
30% for $600,000

00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:48,622
and basically give my company
at that kind of discount,

00:39:48,689 --> 00:39:50,090
and I don't have
any kind of guarantee

00:39:50,157 --> 00:39:52,292
that I-I can even get into,
uh, you know,

00:39:52,359 --> 00:39:54,962
the single stadium
that you control,

00:39:55,028 --> 00:39:57,197
then I'm in a position where
I'm trying to understand

00:39:57,264 --> 00:39:59,199
what kind of value
that you might be adding.

00:39:59,266 --> 00:40:01,301
Then you just have to decide.

00:40:01,368 --> 00:40:02,503
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:04,571
James, you wouldn't have
come back here

00:40:04,638 --> 00:40:07,708
if you didn't see value
in the tank in us.

00:40:07,774 --> 00:40:09,910
So don't ask us to start
selling ourselves

00:40:09,977 --> 00:40:11,512
back to you now.

00:40:11,578 --> 00:40:13,213
You're the one that came back.

00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,215
We're not--We didn't go see you.

00:40:15,282 --> 00:40:16,917
No more talking.

00:40:16,984 --> 00:40:19,419
We made a very fair offer
to you.

00:40:19,486 --> 00:40:21,054
You've gotta make a decision.

00:40:22,623 --> 00:40:24,324
It's a $1 million
bottle of wine.

00:40:24,391 --> 00:40:25,559
(laughs) Yeah.

00:40:28,462 --> 00:40:30,697
30% of the company.

00:40:32,833 --> 00:40:35,869
That should go
for $1.2 million,

00:40:35,936 --> 00:40:38,205
and I'm gonna sell it
for...

00:40:38,272 --> 00:40:40,374
$600,000.

00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,309
I don't think you're
thinking clearly on that.

00:40:42,376 --> 00:40:44,578
Well, hang on. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Kevin, I think he's saying yes.

00:40:47,281 --> 00:40:48,715
What are you saying?

00:40:50,584 --> 00:40:52,085
James, let me drink
one of those with you...

00:40:52,152 --> 00:40:54,221
Kevin. Kevin.
In celebration of the deal.

00:40:54,288 --> 00:40:56,757
(Robert) James,
what are you saying?

00:40:56,823 --> 00:40:58,959
(sets down cup)

00:41:02,729 --> 00:41:04,398
I'm out.

00:41:04,464 --> 00:41:06,633
You know what? I'm out.

00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:10,504
You screwed around.

00:41:10,571 --> 00:41:12,339
You're playing games,

00:41:12,406 --> 00:41:14,374
and there's nothing I hate more
than playing games.
(slapping hand)

00:41:14,441 --> 00:41:16,410
You knew the number. You knew
the number when you walked out,

00:41:16,476 --> 00:41:17,744
you knew the number
when you walked in,

00:41:17,811 --> 00:41:20,414
and you came in
and created drama.

00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,381
That makes--
No.

00:41:21,448 --> 00:41:23,817
I came looking
to make partners with you

00:41:23,884 --> 00:41:28,422
at a very reasonable valuation
that was done by experts,

00:41:28,488 --> 00:41:32,726
not by someone that says, "well,
I see what the wine industry is.

00:41:32,793 --> 00:41:34,294
My friends Have wineries."

00:41:34,361 --> 00:41:35,262
These are the top experts
in the country

00:41:35,329 --> 00:41:37,297
who have told me
what my company's worth.

00:41:37,364 --> 00:41:39,666
But none of them
gave you any money.

00:41:39,733 --> 00:41:41,201
You know as well as we do

00:41:41,268 --> 00:41:43,704
that it's worth what
someone will pay for it.

00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:47,374
I'm just telling you, James,
I'm out.

00:41:55,716 --> 00:41:57,417
Robert, Kevin,
you guys gonna split it?

00:41:57,484 --> 00:41:59,319
Yeah, well,
you know, James, I...

00:41:59,386 --> 00:42:00,654
I'm--I'm really out.

00:42:00,721 --> 00:42:02,389
(laughs)
I mean, you just came here
to waste our time.

00:42:02,456 --> 00:42:04,424
(Robert) So...

00:42:04,491 --> 00:42:05,692
cheers.

00:42:07,628 --> 00:42:09,296
(exhales deeply)

00:42:13,867 --> 00:42:16,270
I'm sorry, but I think
I've earned this.

00:42:16,336 --> 00:42:20,841
(sharks laughing)

00:42:20,908 --> 00:42:22,209
I came here in good faith,

00:42:22,276 --> 00:42:25,245
really wishing for these sharks
to become my partners.

00:42:25,312 --> 00:42:26,413
No one could share
in that vision.

00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,648
It was all about the money

00:42:27,714 --> 00:42:29,216
and whether they could
get a discount

00:42:29,283 --> 00:42:31,051
on the value of my company.

00:42:31,118 --> 00:42:32,319
I won't be back.
