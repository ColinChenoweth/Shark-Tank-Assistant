a common nail polish bottle,

put it on top
of a small plastic container,

the remover, and the file--
In one easy-to-Use container?

00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,117
of nail polish on the top.

00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:11,919
When you remove it
from the bottom,

00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,121
it has a nail file.

00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:18,458
When you pull this tab,
you will find cotton pads

00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:21,195

with nail polish remover.

you sell it for.

Right now, because I'm only
doing a run of 10,000,

00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:37,845
it's just a little over $3.

00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:39,446
$3.
And what do you sell it for?

00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:40,447
$14.99.

00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:41,815
Ooh. I like those margins.

00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:43,050
So would the average woman
think that's expensive,

00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,052
the $14.99?
I don't believe so,

00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,021

of the cosmetic-Type stores.

anything else like this?

00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:07,474

nothing out there like this

we were doing very well.

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,041
And actually
that's why I'm here now,

because the last
couple years,

00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:47,881
it's been extremely challenging
for our family.

00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:50,017
Barbara, do you have any channel
in distribution or retail

00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:53,587
that's agreed to take it on
or give you an order?

00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:55,055
I have really just started
talking to them

00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:56,957
within the last month,
'cause I find with the products

00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,193
that you can explain it

00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:01,295
and it sounds like
a really great idea,

00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,630
but until you actually
see it, feel it, touch it,

00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:04,064
it makes--

00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:06,633
It has such a wow factor
to it.
So your premise of demand

00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,569
is based on
your own family experience,

00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:11,505
your six daughters and yourself
on Nail night sundays.

00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:13,207

Yeah, right.

I don't think
my italian Husband would

00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:22,749
like that very much.
(Robert) Yeah.

00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:24,117
(Lori) Dream on. Come on.
Yeah.

00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:25,252
(Kevin) the premise
of this brand is not necessarily

00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,920
the quality
of the nail polish itself.

00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,623

that you're providing

00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,891
by putting the pads
underneath the bottle.

00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:31,892
I'm not saying it's bad.

00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,727
Mm-hmm.
I'm just wondering,

00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:35,229
where's the proof?

00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:36,029
You know, I'm
a skeptical investor, Barbara.

00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:38,932

I want to know that
it's gonna work,

00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:40,434
not just
because your six daughters

00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:42,769
and yourself had a great time
on a Sunday night with it.

00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,872
Right.
Now if this doesn't work,

00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:47,441
you've blown $300,000, right?

00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:49,610
But I don't look
at it negatively like that.
No, no.

00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:50,043
I'm not trying to be negative.
(mark) And you shouldn't.

00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,446
And you know what?
You shouldn't, right?
Right.

00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:54,882
Barbara, I can't add
any value with this.

00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:56,049
I mean, the--the thought
of spending $300,000

00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:58,752
before you have orders...
Mm-Hmm.

00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:02,789
Wow, you gotta have
some, uh, guts to do that.

00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:05,826

the challenge I have

00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,998
is that right now
it's just you, right,

00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:13,667
and so you're gonna need
a big support team

00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:15,035
in order to get it
where you need to go.

00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,137
I'm not the guy
to help you build

00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:19,273
that infrastructure
and support team

00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:20,374
to go out
and sell this product,

00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,108
and for that reason,
I'm out.

00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,512
It's great that
you got to this point,

00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:26,847
but I don't know
if it sells.

00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:28,882
You know what I need?
I want some distribution.

00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,117
What are you gonna do
with this, Lori?

00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:31,552
What am <i>I </i>gonna do with it?
Yeah.

00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,921
(laughs) What are you gonna
do with it, Kevin?

00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:36,390
No, but if you told me
you were gonna put it on qvc,

00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,925
I might get interested
in funding some of it.

00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:40,561
That's my point.
It needs distribution.

00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,430
Well, here's the thing.
If I'm gonna put it in on qvc,

00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:44,631
I'm not gonna need your help.

00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:45,065
Well, maybe you do...

00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:48,769
exactly.
Because you have
the same risk I have.

00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:50,437
Why?
Well, look, you may be
a greedy Savage,

00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:51,605
but you may make
a big mistake.

00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:53,540
(chuckles)
I'm not worried about it.

00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:55,175
I'm not worried about what--

00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:58,011
you tell him, Lori.
If I decide to go in on this,
I can do it myself.

00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:00,347
Well, then what are
you doing?

00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:03,417
Because maybe
what I'll do is--
I'm gonna make you an offer.

00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,919
Then I may have to bid you up.
I'll make you pay more.

00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,455
I'm telling you...
I'm not afraid.

00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:09,056
Don't mess
with Mr. Wonderful.
I-I'm not--

00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:11,458
(mark)
he's all talk and no bite.
I'm not worried.

00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:12,893
You--You just sit back
and watch me make me money.

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,894
Let's see.
There you go.

00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:14,895
Let's see what happens.
Okay.

00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:17,397
All right, so I like this.

00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:18,031
Thank you.

00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:20,133
I can do millions
of this for you

00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:25,005
on qvc and everywhere else.
So here's my offer.

00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:27,007
I'm gonna give you the $50,000,

00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:29,543
and I want 51%
in the company...

00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,043
(scoffs)
Wow.

00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:35,949
Because I'm gonna take this,
and tomorrow morning,

00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,050
you and I are gonna get
on the phone

00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:40,754
and we're gonna strategize
what we're gonna do immediately

00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:43,123
with the 10,000 units that
you already have sitting there.

00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,360
I will get that on my show.
We will launch it.

00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:49,630
We will be a huge success,
and I give you one condition.

00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,632
You ready?
Okay.

00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,067
The one condition is
that the night that I launch it,

00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:56,436
you get your entire family,

00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:58,772
all those six daughters
of yours, together,

00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,440
you throw a huge party...

00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:01,475
(chuckles)
And you hoot and Holler

00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,143
and drink a huge glass
of Champagne

00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,778
when you see
that "Sold out" sign

00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:06,013
come up on air.

00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:08,649
All right.
I have an offer for you.
That would work.

00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,918
I'll give you
the $50,000 for 40%.

00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,619
Then I'll just call her.

00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:13,921
(laughs)
(mark laughs) Yeah.

00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:15,589
I don't know. This sounds
like a personal thing.

00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:18,125
But he's not gonna get it
on air immediately...
(laughs)

00:09:18,192 --> 00:09:19,726
I'll just go
to their competitor.
And he doesn't have

00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,261
the following,
the millions of viewers.
I'll just go to--

00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:22,362
I'll just go
to their competitor.

00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:23,597
There's another one that
does this, too.

00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:24,031
Barbara, I r--I rarely--
No, no. Let me jump in.

00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:27,134
I rarely say this,
but sometimes it's better

00:09:27,201 --> 00:09:30,037
to own 49% of something
that's selling

00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:33,941
than 100% of a pure idea.

00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:36,043
Exactly.
(Kevin) he's not writing you
a check.

00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:37,044
It's very interesting advice.

00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,447
It's exactly worth that--
Nothing.

00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:42,115
Very interesting moment for you.
What are you gonna do?

00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:48,922
♪♪♪

00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:58,432
♪♪♪

00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:01,401
<i>Two sharks are out,</i>

00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:04,771
<i>and Barbara has two offers</i>
<i>on the table,</i>

00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:07,374
<i>one from Lori</i>
<i>and one from Kevin.</i>

00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,443
(Lori) Let me tell you
one thing first.

00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:13,347
I treat all of my products
as though they were my babies,

00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:16,250
and I put my heart and soul
into everything.

00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:20,554
I will treat your products
exactly like one of my own,

00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:24,157
and that means, actually,
that I will watch even closer,

00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:26,393
because I will feel responsible
to you

00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,196
and to your making back
your $300,000

00:10:29,263 --> 00:10:32,165
and to you being
really successful,

00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:36,170
so all of that will go
into what I do.

00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:39,206
Tv ladies are
a dime a dozen.

00:10:39,273 --> 00:10:40,474
There's many competitor--
Ohh.

00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:41,775
Excuse me. Let me say
what I want to say.

00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:43,377
That's so not True.
There's lots--

00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:44,778
Look, I'm just speaking
the truth here.

00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:46,980
There's lots of people
that can get you

00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:49,349
on shopping <i>channels, </i>
because there's more than one.

00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,218
That is so wrong.
That's what makes
America great.

00:10:51,285 --> 00:10:53,554
There's more than one.
There's always competition,

00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,456
so the decision you have
to make, Barbara, is,

00:10:56,523 --> 00:11:00,527
should you give up control
of your baby?

00:11:00,594 --> 00:11:01,361
51%.
(chuckles)

00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:02,462
I love that. "Baby."
That means the decisions

00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:05,732
are no longer one
that you make alone, okay?

00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:08,168
Right.
I don't need to have control
in this situation,

00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:10,270
because I totally trust
your decision-Making.

00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:11,471
You've got it here.

00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:14,208
I'm a financial investor.
You need money.

00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:17,778
Now what I'm prepared to do is
give you the same offer for 40%.

00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:20,547
Then I'll call
the shopping channels with you.

00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:22,649
Done that before, so lots--
and they'll hang up
when they hear him.

00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:24,151
Well, maybe this one will,

00:11:24,218 --> 00:11:26,220
or maybe another buyer will
understand the opportunity,

00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:27,354
and we'll go to them.

00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:29,489
I've sold lots of stuff
on shopping channels

00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:31,024
in my career,
all kinds of products,

00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:32,492
from children's software...

00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,561
and it works.
I know how to do it.

00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:36,997
Now, daymond,
you've got retail.

00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:38,565
You wanna come in with me
on this?
(Lori scoffs)

00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:41,368
I've been in the shopping world,
shopping channel world,

00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:43,036
for 15 years.

00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:44,938
You talk like it's nothing.

00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:48,408
Most people fail that
go on, but--
not me. I don't fail.

00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,210
Yeah, you will fail.
But, see, we don't--
We don't--We don't fail--

00:11:50,277 --> 00:11:51,545
You know nothing about
nail polish.
Wait a minute.

00:11:51,612 --> 00:11:53,447
I'm not gonna sell it.
Wait, Wait, Wait,
wait, wait.

00:11:53,514 --> 00:11:55,048
I've been on for 15 years.
I'm not gonna sell it.
Barbara's gonna sell it.

00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:56,450
You can't just call up
a buyer and say, "hey..."
No.

00:11:56,517 --> 00:11:58,552
We just take the 10,000 units,
put it into duty-Free,

00:11:58,619 --> 00:12:00,454
and then license the rest
to avon,

00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:02,523
and we won't need
a shopping channel,

00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,391
so--
And they talk like it's so easy,

00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,527
and you know it's not.
Yeah, that's 'cause we've
done it before.

00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:07,728
We've done it before.
I'm sorry. We've done it.
You--You know what?

00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:09,229
We've done it before.
Sorry. You have not.

00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:11,398
I know all about qvc...
we've done it before.

00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:12,666
And I know the success rate.
All right.

00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,234
Big deal.
I've been doing retail
for 25 years...

00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:15,469
you don't know how to sell
on tv, daymond.
And branding.

00:12:15,536 --> 00:12:17,404
I've forgotten more
than she has learned.

00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:19,406
I'm not worried about that.
That is not--
Oh, come on.

00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:21,041
I couldn't care less
about that.

00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:22,709
If you want to deal
with financial guys...
the issue is that--

00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:24,578
the issue is that--
That smoke cigarettes

00:12:24,645 --> 00:12:25,712
and drink scotch and talk
about the markets--
You know what, honestly?

00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:27,047
(daymond)
Uh, listen, listen, listen.
(laughs)

00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:28,415
a piggy bank
with two Nickels in it

00:12:28,482 --> 00:12:30,417
makes way more noise
than a full piggy bank,

00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:31,852
and I have a <i>lot... </i>
(laughing)

00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,554
Oh, my god.
Of knowledge.

00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,056
That's a great one.
My piggy Bank is as full
as his piggy bank.

00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:37,457
That was nasty.

00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:38,825
You want to do the deal
at 40%?

00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:40,661
(sighs)

00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:42,896
Negotiate, Barbara.

00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:45,399
Well, the--the 51%...
You've got the leverage.

00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:46,800
Does scare me.

00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:49,469
I'm just...
(speaks indistinctly)
And you should be scared.

00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:51,572
What do you offer back
to me, Barbara?

00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:52,539
I like the 40%.

00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:54,241
I like--I like you.
You want 40%?

00:12:54,308 --> 00:12:55,609
You seem like a lovely lady,
and I like the idea

00:12:55,676 --> 00:12:58,378
of the big party
and all of us girls.

00:12:58,445 --> 00:12:59,379
Wow.
All right.

00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:02,950
I'll give you $50,000. 40%.

00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,852
Don't do it, Barbara.

00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,889
Done. You have to ignore them.
They don't exist anymore.

00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:10,390
You don't have to do
anything.

00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:13,760
Right now. Say yes, and it'll be
on qvc within months.

00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,098
Yes.

00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:21,034
Done. Good job, Lori.
Wow. Bang!

00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:22,703
Oh, she got <i>you, </i>O'Leary.

00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:24,137
(Kevin) No, she didn't.
She got you.

00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:25,873
She had to come down
to my price.
Thank you.

00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:27,374
Thank you so much.
(speaks indistinctly)

00:13:27,441 --> 00:13:28,375
I hope so.

00:13:28,442 --> 00:13:29,576
I promise you.

00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,278
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Yeah.

00:13:31,345 --> 00:13:32,579
I'm so excited.
(Robert) Yeah, she--

00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,548
Congratulations, Barbara.
Congrats.
Thank you, everybody.

00:13:34,615 --> 00:13:36,550
Way to go, Lori.
Good job, Lori.

00:13:36,617 --> 00:13:37,484
Whoo! Oh, yeah.

00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:39,152
Well, I want you all
to know,

00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:41,522

Debbie and I are married

00:16:04,576 --> 00:16:07,346
We have a beautiful baby girl
and, of course, our business.

00:16:07,413 --> 00:16:10,616
When we first met, I got fired
from my job, so I said to him,

00:16:10,683 --> 00:16:12,618
"I'm gonna come work for you,
'cause if we end up together,

00:16:12,685 --> 00:16:13,919
"you'd better make a lot
of money,

00:16:13,986 --> 00:16:15,588
'cause now I'm
a starving artist."

00:16:15,654 --> 00:16:17,790
So I went to work for him,
selling air conditioning

00:16:17,856 --> 00:16:20,292
and refrigeration service
contracts door-To-Door.

00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:21,994
But I knew art was
her passion,

00:16:22,061 --> 00:16:24,063
so I gave her a check
for $5,000 for christmas

00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:26,432
to buy a Booth
at upcoming artexpo New York,

00:16:26,498 --> 00:16:28,467
and that's how we launched
the art business.

00:16:28,534 --> 00:16:30,336
Then one day,
money got a little tight,

00:16:30,402 --> 00:16:32,504
and I couldn't afford to go
shopping for a new handbag,

00:16:32,571 --> 00:16:34,673
so I made one,
and a woman loved it

00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,208
and chased me
through an airport.

00:16:36,275 --> 00:16:39,111
She said, "where did you get
that fabulous bag?"

00:16:39,178 --> 00:16:40,179
and, sharks, we have some
of those items

00:16:40,245 --> 00:16:42,548
for you to look at.

00:16:42,615 --> 00:16:44,250
This one we made
for Gwyneth paltrow.

00:16:44,316 --> 00:16:46,785
That's one of my favorites.
(daymond) Mm.

00:16:46,852 --> 00:16:49,855
This one we made
just for you in mind.

00:16:49,922 --> 00:16:50,856
Oh, my goodness.
That's nice.

00:16:50,923 --> 00:16:52,091
Oh, that's cool.

00:16:52,157 --> 00:16:53,092
(Paul) So I thought,

00:16:53,158 --> 00:16:54,293
if that crazy woman
in the airport

00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,195
loved Debbie's bag
so much,

00:16:56,262 --> 00:16:57,196
maybe we should take this
to a retailer,

00:16:57,263 --> 00:16:58,697
so we took our line
to henri bendel's

00:16:58,764 --> 00:17:00,165
on fifth Avenue,

00:17:00,232 --> 00:17:01,600
and that's where we launched
the handbag collection.

00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:03,702
Now through all of this,
there's one thing I learned

00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:05,337
about women.
Just one?

00:17:05,404 --> 00:17:06,639
Just one.
(chuckles)

00:17:06,705 --> 00:17:08,274
Women need a different look
to match

00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,308
every single outfit
they own.

00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,810
That is why I came up
with the magna fab concept,

00:17:11,877 --> 00:17:13,679
short for "Magna fabulous."

00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:16,181
Well, this is how they work.

00:17:16,248 --> 00:17:20,386
You just push down,
and they're all magnetic.

00:17:20,452 --> 00:17:23,222
We are grateful
for the success we've had today,

00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:25,224
and we believe, together,
with your involvement,

00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,293
we can make "Debbie Brooks"
a household name.

00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,594
(Robert) What's the business?

00:17:28,661 --> 00:17:31,096
Are we buying into
just that handbag with that

00:17:31,163 --> 00:17:33,632
or all of it?
It's the entire
Debbie Brooks brand.

00:17:33,699 --> 00:17:35,100
And we also have two patents.

00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:38,270
And what do you want
the money for?

00:17:38,337 --> 00:17:40,272
Basically,
our main distribution channel

00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:41,373
right now is
jewelry stores.

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,875
We're in 1,000 jewelry stores
across the country.

00:17:42,942 --> 00:17:45,110
We are typically the first
and only accessory item sold

00:17:45,177 --> 00:17:46,111
in these stores.

00:17:46,178 --> 00:17:47,613
Because of the economy,

00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,615
they've been very receptive
to our product category,

00:17:49,682 --> 00:17:51,216
and our sell-Through in
that jewelry store environment

00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:54,720
has been remarkable.
So the $540,000 is to do

00:17:54,787 --> 00:17:56,288
a little bit more
of what we're doing already.

00:17:56,355 --> 00:17:59,124
Okay, But, Paul,
the valuation of the business--

00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:01,794
You're asking me
for $540,000 for 20%--

00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,363
We're about $2.7 million
in value.

00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,464
Exactly.

00:18:05,531 --> 00:18:08,100
Make me excited
that that's a good deal.

00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:10,936
$1.2 million is
our gross sales for the company.

00:18:11,003 --> 00:18:14,373
Our gross profit is
$685,000.

00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,108
What does a purse like
this cost?

00:18:16,175 --> 00:18:18,944
That's
a $288 retail price point.

00:18:19,011 --> 00:18:20,312
And what'd it cost you
to make?

00:18:20,379 --> 00:18:23,549
So wholesale cost on that
is $130 wholesale.

00:18:23,616 --> 00:18:26,185
Markup at retail is 2.2.
(Robert) So is that a lot, Paul?

00:18:26,252 --> 00:18:27,920
Like, I-I don't know.
To an average woman--
Actually, it's--

00:18:27,987 --> 00:18:29,421
It's very comfortable.
It's incredibly comfortable.

00:18:29,488 --> 00:18:30,689
Are you guys familiar with
a brand called "Judith leiber"?

00:18:30,756 --> 00:18:31,690
I'm sure you are.
(Lori) Yes.

00:18:31,757 --> 00:18:33,125
Okay.
Yes.

00:18:33,192 --> 00:18:35,261
That was a $2,000 to $3,000
to $5,000 retail price point.

00:18:35,327 --> 00:18:37,696
But they're
all swarovski crystals.

00:18:37,763 --> 00:18:40,199
They are
swarovski crystals.

00:18:40,266 --> 00:18:41,100
Which--
Correct.

00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,435
Which justifies
that enormous price point.

00:18:43,502 --> 00:18:45,170
The secret
to our success is,

00:18:45,237 --> 00:18:46,372
we're selling
in a high-End environment,

00:18:46,438 --> 00:18:48,841
so the initial perception
of our line in that environment

00:18:48,907 --> 00:18:50,309
is these should be $1,000.

00:18:50,376 --> 00:18:52,344
So, Paul, $288 is high-End?

00:18:52,411 --> 00:18:54,246
Comfortable price point
in a jewelry store environment.

00:18:54,313 --> 00:18:56,115
All right,
so I-I don't want to--
correct.

00:18:56,181 --> 00:18:57,516
And that's why you're
in jewelry stores, right?
(Debbie) Yes. Exactly.

00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:58,550
Precisely.
Because the perception is
completely different.

00:18:58,617 --> 00:19:00,352
Yeah. You got it.
You're not in--

00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:01,353
It augments the perception.
Y-You're not head-to-Head
with everybody else

00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,255
and every other purse,
right?
Exactly.

00:19:03,322 --> 00:19:04,623
Jewelry stores are having
a tough time right now

00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:07,126
because their entry level
price points are very high.

00:19:07,192 --> 00:19:09,094
They need something that's gonna
bring in a new customer

00:19:09,161 --> 00:19:10,596
and that's gonna build
a collector base

00:19:10,663 --> 00:19:12,164
and get them back
into that store.

00:19:12,231 --> 00:19:13,365
That's why they love
our line,

00:19:13,432 --> 00:19:14,967
and that's why we've had
tremendous success

00:19:15,034 --> 00:19:16,168
with the line.

00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:18,337
As a woman, do you like it?

00:19:20,205 --> 00:19:23,175
Do you hate it? You don't want
to hurt their feelings?

00:19:23,242 --> 00:19:26,712
No, I don't hate it.
I like some of them,

00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:29,114
but here's
what I'm struggling with.

00:19:29,181 --> 00:19:32,117
The only thing, to me,
that is unique and different

00:19:32,184 --> 00:19:34,520
is the interchangeability
of your magnet.

00:19:34,587 --> 00:19:35,921
Exactly.

00:19:35,988 --> 00:19:39,024
And I'd like to understand
your patent or <i>patents.</i>

00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:40,993
We created
this fabrication medium,

00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,461
3-Dimensional
fabrication medium.

00:19:42,528 --> 00:19:45,197
Of that process,
it's entirely patented

00:19:45,264 --> 00:19:47,199
by a utility process.

00:19:47,266 --> 00:19:50,035
Now we have
a second patent, okay,

00:19:50,102 --> 00:19:52,671
which applies
to the adhesion aspect

00:19:52,738 --> 00:19:54,807
of the magna fab,
the removal aspect.

00:19:54,873 --> 00:19:58,310
So it is the Click-On
and Click-Off.
Precisely. Precisely.

00:19:58,377 --> 00:20:00,112
Anybody else can make
a magnet

00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:02,214
that fits on the front
of a purse.

00:20:02,281 --> 00:20:04,183
You could make a look
that's similar,

00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,584
but you can't make
this identical look...

00:20:05,651 --> 00:20:07,219
I don't think anybody cares.
Without infringing
on our patent.

00:20:07,286 --> 00:20:10,389
I-I think there's
a million other ways to do that.

00:20:10,456 --> 00:20:11,490
I'm out.

00:20:13,158 --> 00:20:15,694
Before you were talking
about patents,

00:20:15,761 --> 00:20:17,196
you were talking
about numbers.

00:20:17,263 --> 00:20:18,597
Precisely.
Get me back there.

00:20:18,664 --> 00:20:21,800
Okay.
28% up 2011 from 2010.

00:20:21,867 --> 00:20:24,169
No, But just give me
the forecast for 2011.
Now I did a one--

00:20:24,236 --> 00:20:25,871
Top-Line dollars.
$1.6 million.

00:20:25,938 --> 00:20:27,873
$1.6 million.
What am I gonna make on it?

00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,376
Uh, at least $400,000 net.

00:20:30,442 --> 00:20:33,379
Paul, why are you here?
Why do you need the $540,000?

00:20:33,445 --> 00:20:35,214
We're ready to take the company
to the next level.

00:20:35,281 --> 00:20:36,515
One-Third of that

00:20:36,582 --> 00:20:39,118
we wanna put into
direct to consumer advertising.

00:20:39,184 --> 00:20:41,020
A third of that
into trade advertising.

00:20:41,086 --> 00:20:43,188
The final third would be to
increase our inventory levels,

00:20:43,255 --> 00:20:45,391
which are currently
at $240,000.

00:20:45,457 --> 00:20:46,859
As we continue
to build the brand

00:20:46,926 --> 00:20:48,961
and the name recognition
improves,

00:20:49,028 --> 00:20:50,596
okay, there are
huge licensing opportunities.

00:20:50,663 --> 00:20:51,964
But that's a long shot.

00:20:52,031 --> 00:20:53,299
You know, that's p--
That's a long shot.

00:20:53,365 --> 00:20:56,468
I'm not a purse guy, obviously.
Not even a murse guy.

00:20:56,535 --> 00:20:58,470
Not even a murse guy?
(Robert) What's a murse, mark?

00:20:58,537 --> 00:21:00,806
A man purse. Murse.
Um... (chuckles)

00:21:00,873 --> 00:21:02,107
Wow.
(Lori laughs)

00:21:02,174 --> 00:21:03,709
I like the fact
that you're selling

00:21:03,776 --> 00:21:05,144
in jewelry stores, right?

00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:06,211
You go where they ain't.

00:21:06,278 --> 00:21:08,213
I think that's brilliant.

00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,182
But at the same time,
I just don't think

00:21:10,249 --> 00:21:12,351
that I can add the value
that you would need.

00:21:12,418 --> 00:21:14,753
So for that reason,
I'm out.

00:21:16,322 --> 00:21:17,456
Um, so...

00:21:17,523 --> 00:21:19,892
Debbie, I-I...

00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:22,361
I'm not really sure what--
what you're selling today.

00:21:22,428 --> 00:21:25,097
The brand in its entirety.
We wanna build the brand.

00:21:25,164 --> 00:21:26,265
(Robert) I...

00:21:26,332 --> 00:21:29,635
y-You know, I found it
a little confusing just for me,

00:21:29,702 --> 00:21:31,203
maybe because I'm not a...

00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,938
what did mark call it?
A man purse?

00:21:33,005 --> 00:21:36,141
A murse person, yes.
(Debbie) a murse.
A metrosexual.

00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,177
(laughs)
(Robert) Yeah, maybe I'm not
a murse enough guy.

00:21:38,243 --> 00:21:39,745
But I found the presentation
a little confusing.

00:21:39,812 --> 00:21:42,848
I'm not really sure
what's in the business.

00:21:42,915 --> 00:21:45,150
I'm out.

00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,921
<i>Three sharks are out.</i>

00:21:48,988 --> 00:21:50,289
<i>Kevin and Lori are</i>

00:21:50,356 --> 00:21:53,259
<i>Debbie and Paul's last chance</i>
<i>to make a deal.</i>

00:21:53,325 --> 00:21:56,629
Uh, Paul... and Debbie...

00:21:59,131 --> 00:22:00,266
I like cash <i>flow. </i>
Me, too.

00:22:00,332 --> 00:22:01,533
Love it. I like the way
it rolls off my lips.

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,768
That's why we're
in jewelry stores.
I love it.

00:22:02,835 --> 00:22:05,271
Cash <i>flow. </i>So...

00:22:05,337 --> 00:22:07,606
I look at the cash flow you've
got, and I say to myself,

00:22:07,673 --> 00:22:10,276
in your industry--
Fashion--

00:22:10,342 --> 00:22:14,113
Would anybody ever pay
9.5 times Free cash flow?

00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:15,748
And I don't think they would.

00:22:15,814 --> 00:22:17,616
Can I interrupt
a quick second?

00:22:17,683 --> 00:22:18,918
You may.

00:22:18,984 --> 00:22:20,185
If you're not taking
into account the patent,

00:22:20,252 --> 00:22:21,954
the I.P.

00:22:22,021 --> 00:22:24,256
--
--

00:22:26,592 --> 00:22:29,561
I think your valuation is...

00:22:29,628 --> 00:22:32,097
100% too much.

00:22:32,164 --> 00:22:33,632
You have to cut this in half.

00:22:33,699 --> 00:22:37,102
And having said all that,
I love Debbie's designs...

00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:38,304
thank you.

00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,672
And I will pay you for this.

00:22:39,738 --> 00:22:40,839
I'll buy this...
we figured you'd like
that one.

00:22:40,906 --> 00:22:43,008
Because it says,
"you're dead to me,"

00:22:43,075 --> 00:22:44,410
and you are,
'cause I'm out.

00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:53,285
I think you've got
a lot of patent issues here.

00:22:53,352 --> 00:22:56,188
I'm not really trusting
what your patent is all about.

00:22:56,255 --> 00:22:59,358
And for that reason,
I'm out.

00:23:02,761 --> 00:23:05,631
Okay. Well, thank you very much
for your time.

00:23:05,698 --> 00:23:06,865
Thank you.
(mark) Thanks, guys. Good luck.

00:23:06,932 --> 00:23:08,200
(Lori) Good luck.

00:23:11,503 --> 00:23:13,038
Actually, the patent wasn't
even to sell.

00:23:13,105 --> 00:23:15,140
The patent didn't cover
anything.
No.

00:23:15,207 --> 00:23:17,109
There's a lot of great product
out there,

00:23:17,176 --> 00:23:19,845
and these aren't unique.
That's the bottom line.

00:23:19,912 --> 00:23:21,680
Lori was very interested
in our patent.

00:23:21,747 --> 00:23:22,881
I hope that doesn't mean

00:23:22,948 --> 00:23:24,416
she's gonna go home
and knock us off now.

00:23:24,483 --> 00:23:27,019
She couldn't.
She sells bags for $20.
Whoa.

And I'm Lindsay Johnson.

00:23:57,614 --> 00:24:00,184
Our company is trimi tank.

00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,286
We feature the only tank top
on the market

00:24:02,353 --> 00:24:05,956
with interchangeable 
removable straps.

00:24:06,023 --> 00:24:08,992
We are seeking
a $57,000 investment...

00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:10,594
(chuckles)
for a 30% stake in our company.

00:24:10,661 --> 00:24:12,196
(mouths word)

00:24:12,262 --> 00:24:14,565
We are
two pittsburgh hockey moms...

00:24:14,631 --> 00:24:17,000
There ya go. Go, pens!

00:24:17,067 --> 00:24:18,202
Who came up
with this concept

00:24:18,268 --> 00:24:20,170
at our sons' 6:00 a.M.
Hockey practice.

00:24:20,237 --> 00:24:23,006
Each trimi tank comes with
three sets of straps

00:24:23,073 --> 00:24:24,475
that you get to choose.

00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:27,344
You can choose to layer them
or mix and match them

00:24:27,411 --> 00:24:29,747
or simply just wear
one at a time.

00:24:29,813 --> 00:24:33,083
The straps are super easy
to come on and off.

00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,352
And they come in so many
different varieties.

00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:38,422
There's jewelry straps,
ribbon straps,

00:24:38,489 --> 00:24:41,492
funky straps,
any kind of...

00:24:41,558 --> 00:24:42,993
and you're good to go.
Any strap you could imagine.

00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,229
Currently, we are handmaking
each strap

00:24:45,295 --> 00:24:47,197
and selling the tanks
in our homes.

00:24:47,264 --> 00:24:49,733
Can I see the--
the, um, the tops, please?

00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,201
Sure.
Absolutely.

00:24:51,268 --> 00:24:52,936
In the future, we're hoping
that these straps

00:24:53,003 --> 00:24:56,040
could then be interchanged
throughout a whole wardrobe.

00:24:56,106 --> 00:24:58,675
Thank you.
So they could go from
your shirt to your dress,

00:24:58,742 --> 00:24:59,943
like Lindsay's wearing today.

00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,245
How many have you sold?

00:25:01,311 --> 00:25:03,247
We have sold approximately 100.
To date.

00:25:03,313 --> 00:25:04,515
100,000?

00:25:04,581 --> 00:25:05,816
No, 100.
No, 100.

00:25:05,883 --> 00:25:07,785
Oh.

00:25:07,851 --> 00:25:08,952
1-0-0.

00:25:09,019 --> 00:25:10,354
So many dollars is that?
100 units.

00:25:10,421 --> 00:25:12,322
Well...
well, right now,
they're retailing for $35.

00:25:12,389 --> 00:25:13,957
We're retailing them for $35.

00:25:14,024 --> 00:25:16,427
That's $3,500 worth of sales.

00:25:16,493 --> 00:25:17,895
Yes.
Yes.

00:25:17,961 --> 00:25:20,531
You don't need to think about
what we've done.

00:25:20,597 --> 00:25:21,832
You need to think about
what it could be.

00:25:21,899 --> 00:25:23,033
How far we've got--
How far it could go.

00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,835
Yeah, baby! That's right.

00:25:24,902 --> 00:25:26,537
That's the pittsburgh spirit,
right?
(Nicole) And where it can go.

00:25:26,603 --> 00:25:28,605
Where it can go!
Bec--I mean, really.

00:25:28,672 --> 00:25:30,874
I'm gonna ask you
a-a cold, hard truth here.

00:25:30,941 --> 00:25:32,076
Sure.
Okay.

00:25:32,142 --> 00:25:33,677
When you showed these around
to people,

00:25:33,744 --> 00:25:34,978
did you do
any market research,

00:25:35,045 --> 00:25:36,914
ask people what
they thought of it?

00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,148
Yes.
We have done a craft show,

00:25:38,215 --> 00:25:41,251
a huge--Well, not a huge--
But a flea market in pittsburgh.

00:25:41,318 --> 00:25:42,619
And have gone to other, like,
handmade markets.

00:25:42,686 --> 00:25:45,356
Small venues that we could
just get into.
Small markets.

00:25:45,422 --> 00:25:48,025
And how did women react
to this?
Do you know what they say?

00:25:48,092 --> 00:25:50,127
They say,
"that is the coolest idea.

00:25:50,194 --> 00:25:51,695
Why didn't I think of that?"

00:25:51,762 --> 00:25:54,932
and they always say, "you should
be on that 'shark tank' show."

00:25:54,998 --> 00:25:56,433
(laughs)
And did they buy it?

00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,901
They--That's exactly what
they said.
Did they buy it?

00:25:57,968 --> 00:26:00,170
At the time, we had no means
of accepting credit cards,

00:26:00,237 --> 00:26:02,239
and...
and we were in the wrong spot.

00:26:02,306 --> 00:26:05,376
How many women
at that flea market...
you guys are, like,
the best friends.

00:26:05,442 --> 00:26:07,611
Wanted to buy this?
(Lindsay and Nicole) We are!

00:26:07,678 --> 00:26:10,447
They are!
Apparently none.
They $3,500 in sales.

00:26:10,514 --> 00:26:12,616
Shh!
Yeah, but I-I-I just wanna know
the number.

00:26:12,683 --> 00:26:14,284
I would say...

00:26:14,351 --> 00:26:16,954
approximately... 50?

00:26:17,021 --> 00:26:18,155
A lot of them said they didn't
have any money.

00:26:18,222 --> 00:26:19,590
A lot of them have commented--
They asked if we...

00:26:19,656 --> 00:26:21,158
they weren't there
to buy clothes...

00:26:21,225 --> 00:26:23,093
had them on--Online.
Because we were
at a flea market.

00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,295
It was...
they were buying fruit
that day.

00:26:25,362 --> 00:26:27,331
When you're saying that you were
at a flea market,

00:26:27,398 --> 00:26:30,267
and people really actually
didn't buy it.

00:26:30,334 --> 00:26:31,602
They instead bought the fruit

00:26:31,668 --> 00:26:33,604
or they instead bought
something else.

00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:36,006
That's kind of a little bit
of a wake-Up call

00:26:36,073 --> 00:26:39,376
that this might not be
your homerun.

00:26:39,443 --> 00:26:40,544
I'm out.

00:26:40,611 --> 00:26:41,845
Okay.
Okay. Thank you.

00:26:41,912 --> 00:26:44,081
Guys, since y'all are from
the 'burgh, right?

00:26:44,148 --> 00:26:46,450
I love seeing Pittsburgh people
be entrepreneurs

00:26:46,517 --> 00:26:48,919
and--And attack a business.

00:26:48,986 --> 00:26:51,955
Um, we can go drink
some I.C. Light, have a--

00:26:52,022 --> 00:26:53,691
You know what?
Just a minute, mark.

00:26:53,757 --> 00:26:56,226
You can target specific groups.

00:26:56,293 --> 00:26:59,096
Right.
I mean, we could go
into a sorority

00:26:59,163 --> 00:27:01,031
and just have sorority letters
on them.

00:27:01,098 --> 00:27:03,200
You can--We have
awareness ribbons.

00:27:03,267 --> 00:27:04,401
You can go and do--

00:27:04,468 --> 00:27:06,070
Look, I-I like the hustle.
I like the energy.

00:27:06,136 --> 00:27:08,238
I like the vision, even.

00:27:08,305 --> 00:27:11,341
But it's not an area where
I have a lot of expertise.

00:27:11,408 --> 00:27:14,645
I couldn't tell you one good
tank top from another.

00:27:14,712 --> 00:27:17,981
And as much as I wanna see
you guys become successful,

00:27:18,048 --> 00:27:20,417
I just can't help you,
so I have to be out.

00:27:20,484 --> 00:27:22,186
Thank you, though. We'll take
you up on those I.C.S.

00:27:22,252 --> 00:27:23,420
(laughs)
(Robert) Daymond?

00:27:23,487 --> 00:27:25,155
(speaks indistinctly)
(laughs)

00:27:25,222 --> 00:27:26,323
You know what? I saw it
in flea markets as well.

00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:30,294
And, uh, I couldn't keep
the inventory.

00:27:30,361 --> 00:27:32,096
I just couldn't keep it. I would
just keep blowing out of it.

00:27:32,162 --> 00:27:33,864
I would buy, you know,
200 shirts here,

00:27:33,931 --> 00:27:36,100
then I'd come back with 1,000,
and--

00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:39,069
Daymond, This would look great
with a pair of fubu jeans.

00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:41,205
Yeah.
You know it would. It would.

00:27:41,271 --> 00:27:42,406
No, I understand
what you're saying,

00:27:42,473 --> 00:27:44,475
but you're too early of a stage
for me to help you

00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:47,177
or even to understand if there's
a business to help you.

00:27:47,244 --> 00:27:48,412
So...
Mm-hmm.

00:27:48,479 --> 00:27:50,214
I'm sorry. I'm out.

00:27:51,582 --> 00:27:53,083
(Robert) You know, you sold 100.

00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:54,351
It's a risk.

00:27:54,418 --> 00:27:56,120
It's a chance for you to get in
at the ground level and--

00:27:56,186 --> 00:27:57,287
It's way too soon.
It's a Hobby.

00:27:57,354 --> 00:27:59,490
You haven't--you haven't
proved the market yet.

00:27:59,556 --> 00:28:01,091
It's there, though.
It really, really is.

00:28:01,158 --> 00:28:02,126
It really is there.

00:28:02,192 --> 00:28:04,895
Good pitch, great energy,
but I'm out.

00:28:09,099 --> 00:28:10,234
Okay.
Ohh, and you!

00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,368
Now we're down to one shark.

00:28:11,435 --> 00:28:12,569
You know...
you're the best!

00:28:12,636 --> 00:28:15,205
All roads lead--Ohh!
(Robert laughs)

00:28:15,272 --> 00:28:17,508
Listen, listen.
Nicole, that was great.

00:28:17,574 --> 00:28:18,675
Ladies.
(laughs)

00:28:18,742 --> 00:28:20,911
All roads to lead
to Mr. Wonderful in the end.

00:28:20,978 --> 00:28:23,180
So here's my offer to you.

00:28:23,247 --> 00:28:25,616
We go to a fine restaurant.

00:28:25,683 --> 00:28:30,020
I let you choose any bottle
on the list that's worth $3,500,

00:28:30,087 --> 00:28:31,422
which is equal to your sales.

00:28:31,488 --> 00:28:34,692
When dinner's over,
we burn it all.

00:28:34,758 --> 00:28:36,427
How can we let you
kill our baby like that?

00:28:36,493 --> 00:28:40,164
This is not a good idea.
I'm out.

00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:43,767
I think you guys are
really missing out

00:28:43,834 --> 00:28:45,102
on a great opportunity.

00:28:45,169 --> 00:28:46,437
You'll see.
Oh, I know. I know.

00:28:46,503 --> 00:28:48,205
People love these.
I'm not worried about it.

00:28:48,272 --> 00:28:49,873
You'll see, pittsburgh boy.
People love these.

00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,341
Just rock 'n' roll.
Just go with it.

00:28:51,408 --> 00:28:52,676
(singsongy)
See you for dinner!

00:28:52,743 --> 00:28:54,945
Ah!
Oh!

00:28:55,012 --> 00:28:57,247
(Robert) Never good when a shark
says, "see you for dinner."

00:28:57,314 --> 00:29:00,317

00:29:29,765 --> 00:29:31,033
Hi, my name is Mark Lim,

00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,002
this is my beautiful wife Hanna,

00:29:33,068 --> 00:29:34,403
and we are the founders
of lollacup.

00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:38,574
We are here today seeking
a $100,000 investment

00:29:38,641 --> 00:29:41,677
for a 15% equity stake
in our company.

00:29:41,744 --> 00:29:44,280
When our first daughter
was only 9 months old,

00:29:44,346 --> 00:29:46,749
our pediatrician wanted us
to use straw cups

00:29:46,815 --> 00:29:48,717
rather than
the traditional sippys

00:29:48,784 --> 00:29:51,654
because of the speech and dental
benefits of using straws.

00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,324
I must've tried every
toddler straw cup on the market

00:29:55,391 --> 00:29:57,259
only to find that most of them

00:29:57,326 --> 00:30:00,729
had spill-Proof valves,
like these, that made them

00:30:00,796 --> 00:30:03,199
incredibly hard
for her to drink from.

00:30:03,265 --> 00:30:05,334
Cleaning them was
even more frustrating.

00:30:05,401 --> 00:30:08,204
And unlike all the adorable
baby products out there,

00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,972
these cups were
just not cute.

00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:13,209
So mark and I set out to create
a stylish cup

00:30:13,275 --> 00:30:16,045
that both kids
and their parents would love.

00:30:16,111 --> 00:30:20,282
As parents ourselves, safety is
really our number one concern.

00:30:20,349 --> 00:30:22,218
That's why we decided
to manufacture the product

00:30:22,284 --> 00:30:24,620
here in the United States,
so we could be sure

00:30:24,687 --> 00:30:27,223
we'd have a quality product
made with safe plastics.

00:30:27,289 --> 00:30:31,393
I've seen so many toddlers
struggle with straw cups,

00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:34,630
so we designed lollacup to
eliminate all the challenges.

00:30:34,697 --> 00:30:36,031
You don't know how many times

00:30:36,098 --> 00:30:38,534
my daughter has done this
with her straws

00:30:38,601 --> 00:30:40,803
and asked me for more milk,

00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:42,037
simply because the straw
was lodged up here

00:30:42,104 --> 00:30:44,640
and the liquid was resting
down at the bottom.

00:30:44,707 --> 00:30:47,376
Lollacup's weighted straw
keeps it in the liquid,

00:30:47,443 --> 00:30:51,180
so children can actually drink
even when the cup is tilted.

00:30:51,247 --> 00:30:53,048
The handles
make it easy to hold

00:30:53,115 --> 00:30:55,117
But they detach
with a simple twist,

00:30:55,184 --> 00:30:57,786
so you can put it in
a cup Holder or diaper bag.

00:30:57,853 --> 00:31:01,156
Last but not least,
lollacup is easy to clean.

00:31:01,223 --> 00:31:04,126
We are confident that we have
a great product that sells.

00:31:04,193 --> 00:31:06,896
We hope you'll join us
with your expertise and funding

00:31:06,962 --> 00:31:09,098
to help take lollacup
to the next level.

00:31:09,165 --> 00:31:11,867
So do you have sales today
or is that a prototype?

00:31:11,934 --> 00:31:13,969
Yes. In the four months
that we've been shipping,

00:31:14,036 --> 00:31:15,671
we have 30,000 in sales,

00:31:15,738 --> 00:31:19,375
5,000 on order,

00:31:19,441 --> 00:31:22,211
and we have a soft order
of $30,000 for the holiday.

00:31:22,278 --> 00:31:24,647
How much do you sell them for
into retail?

00:31:24,713 --> 00:31:26,048
The retail price is $18,

00:31:26,115 --> 00:31:27,483
it wholesales at $9,

00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:30,085
and it costs us $4.50 to make.

00:31:30,152 --> 00:31:32,755
What does
a normal sippy cup cost?

00:31:32,821 --> 00:31:34,423
Anywhere from $5 to $6,

00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,258
upwards of $25 plus.

00:31:36,325 --> 00:31:38,460
And if you were
making these overseas,

00:31:38,527 --> 00:31:40,729
how much would your cost
to manufacture them be?

00:31:40,796 --> 00:31:42,298
I think if we made them
overseas,

00:31:42,364 --> 00:31:45,634
they could probably be made
for about $2, $2,50.

00:31:45,701 --> 00:31:46,836
And you're paying how much?

00:31:46,902 --> 00:31:48,904
$4.50.

00:31:48,971 --> 00:31:51,674
If we were to go
that overseas route,

00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,043
which really, we don't want to
because we feel like--

00:31:54,109 --> 00:31:55,377
I mean, I can't tell you
the number of times

00:31:55,444 --> 00:31:56,645
I've been in a baby store

00:31:56,712 --> 00:31:58,214
and women literally
walk in and say,

00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,282
"show me every product here
that's not made in China."

00:32:00,349 --> 00:32:03,219
Why do you make the assumption
that a chinese-Made product

00:32:03,285 --> 00:32:05,721
in today's global economy
is poorly made?

00:32:05,788 --> 00:32:08,657
You know, I'm not making
that assumption.

00:32:08,724 --> 00:32:10,059
It's just what
I've personally heard.

00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:12,127
And, you know,
the women I've spoken to,

00:32:12,194 --> 00:32:14,830
the moms that we hang out with,
they're really looking for

00:32:14,897 --> 00:32:17,800
the U.S.A.-,
european-Made products.

00:32:17,867 --> 00:32:19,001
'cause I'm having a hard time

00:32:19,068 --> 00:32:20,636
paying more than 10 bucks
for a sippy cup.

00:32:20,703 --> 00:32:22,137
Yeah, having--Let me just
tell you, I agree with you.

00:32:22,204 --> 00:32:24,206
There's just absolutely
no reason

00:32:24,273 --> 00:32:26,809
to put your kids' health at risk
over $3.

00:32:26,876 --> 00:32:29,278
And I like the weighted, um,
straw idea because

00:32:29,345 --> 00:32:32,882
my little son all the time,
you know, doing this...

00:32:32,948 --> 00:32:34,984
you know, so I get that.

00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:37,486
But the real question
I have is,

00:32:37,553 --> 00:32:40,823
have you tried to go to
the bigger box stores?

00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:42,992
And what was their response?

00:32:43,058 --> 00:32:45,160
Well, we've actually been
approached by several, um,

00:32:45,227 --> 00:32:46,629
big box retailers.

00:32:46,695 --> 00:32:49,231
We took our prototypes again
to a trade show

00:32:49,298 --> 00:32:51,133
last october, and--

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,068
What, uh, what big box store?

00:32:53,135 --> 00:32:54,336
Um, babies "R" us.

00:32:54,403 --> 00:32:56,839
Let me guess. They said it was
way too expensive.

00:32:56,906 --> 00:32:58,174
They actually didn't talk much
about price point.

00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,842
Their main concern was
the packaging.

00:32:59,909 --> 00:33:01,143
(mark) What didn't they like?

00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:02,244
(Robert) What's wrong
with the packaging?

00:33:02,311 --> 00:33:03,479
Yeah,
what didn't they like?
They didn't--

00:33:03,546 --> 00:33:04,647
I think it took
too much real estate,

00:33:04,713 --> 00:33:05,981
and so they wanted
to change the--

00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,216
No, it's not stackable.
That's the problem.

00:33:07,283 --> 00:33:08,450
Right.
And they didn't--

00:33:08,517 --> 00:33:09,985
they said that you couldn't see
the entire product.

00:33:10,052 --> 00:33:12,154
That can be fixed.
All that can be fixed.
(Robert) Yeah.

00:33:12,221 --> 00:33:13,055
I'm trying to figure out
what it is

00:33:13,122 --> 00:33:15,157
that moves millions of units.

00:33:15,224 --> 00:33:19,161
Because I've raised two kids.
Sippy cups are a mandatory item.

00:33:19,228 --> 00:33:21,030
You have
a better mousetrap here.

00:33:21,096 --> 00:33:23,132
What's the price point
that blows it out

00:33:23,199 --> 00:33:25,134
so that every American family
can afford it?

00:33:25,201 --> 00:33:26,635
I would say $10 to $12.

00:33:26,702 --> 00:33:29,071
Okay. So if we have to
sell it at $9.99,

00:33:29,138 --> 00:33:31,340
which is a very popular
retail price point...
Mm-hmm.

00:33:31,407 --> 00:33:33,309
You gotta make it
for a buck 70.

00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:35,978
Right.

00:33:36,045 --> 00:33:37,213
Is that your girls there
in the picture,

00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,414
those adorable girls?

00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,715
Yes. We have two. (laughs)
Yeah. (laughs)

00:33:39,782 --> 00:33:41,951
And do they use the cup
and they--Do they love it?

00:33:42,017 --> 00:33:43,252
Yeah, they love it.

00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:44,286
They think of it as a toy
when they first see it.

00:33:44,353 --> 00:33:45,721
Oh, Hanna, can I see it?
But--Yeah.

00:33:45,788 --> 00:33:47,089
Of course. We have some--

00:33:47,156 --> 00:33:49,892
Did you create this yourself?
Did you think of this idea?

00:33:49,959 --> 00:33:51,093
(mark l.) Yes.
Yeah.

00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,127
Oh, I love the colors.

00:33:52,194 --> 00:33:53,729
The two of you together
or...

00:33:53,796 --> 00:33:56,398
um, you know, I mean, I'm the
mom who uses it the most.

00:33:56,465 --> 00:33:59,368
So I came with the concept,
but we did work on it together.

00:33:59,435 --> 00:34:00,569
(Robert) Thank you.

00:34:00,636 --> 00:34:02,238
(Lori) I love your dedication,

00:34:02,304 --> 00:34:04,840
and I think that This is
really ingenious

00:34:04,907 --> 00:34:06,709
and a great product.

00:34:06,775 --> 00:34:07,910
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:34:07,977 --> 00:34:09,211
Tell me a little bit
about your story.

00:34:09,278 --> 00:34:11,247
Tell me about
the two of you.

00:34:11,313 --> 00:34:12,414
Well, mark and I actually
started dating

00:34:12,481 --> 00:34:14,149
in the seventh grade.

00:34:14,216 --> 00:34:15,217
(laughs) Oh!

00:34:15,284 --> 00:34:16,752
So we actually--We got married
14 years later.

00:34:16,819 --> 00:34:18,087
(Lori) Wow.

00:34:18,153 --> 00:34:19,288
And we started a family
pretty soon after that.

00:34:19,355 --> 00:34:21,223
And we think about our daughters
now, we're like,

00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:23,259
"no way. We do not want them
dating anyone in seventh grade."

00:34:23,325 --> 00:34:24,727
(laughs) Well, if she finds
a nice guy like me,

00:34:24,793 --> 00:34:27,229
the I think I'd... (laughs)

00:34:27,296 --> 00:34:28,297
So how much have you invested
in this?

00:34:28,364 --> 00:34:30,799
We invested, uh, $100,000.

00:34:30,866 --> 00:34:32,067
(daymond) okay.

00:34:32,134 --> 00:34:34,170
And the--the money went towards
product development...

00:34:34,236 --> 00:34:36,405
uh-Huh, casting. I got it.
Industrial design, molds.

00:34:36,472 --> 00:34:38,240
And there's a patent
on this?

00:34:38,307 --> 00:34:40,342
Yes. We actually just got
an e-mail today,

00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:42,878
this morning, that we were
issued the patent.

00:34:42,945 --> 00:34:44,180
Congratulations.
(Lori) It's a utility patent?

00:34:44,246 --> 00:34:45,948
It's a design patent.
Design patent.

00:34:46,015 --> 00:34:47,416
Design. Uh, $100,000...

00:34:47,483 --> 00:34:50,586
right.
For 15% means you're putting
the company's value

00:34:50,653 --> 00:34:52,755
at a half a million dollars,
around...
right.

00:34:52,821 --> 00:34:54,223
So we've signed with a sales rep

00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:56,492
to cover the U.S.,
just two, three weeks ago.

00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:58,494
Exclusivity?
Pardon?

00:34:58,561 --> 00:34:59,728
Did you give them
exclusivity?

00:34:59,795 --> 00:35:00,963
Yes, we did, for one year.

00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,164
Did they give you minimums?

00:35:02,231 --> 00:35:04,233
Um, minimum as in--
In other words,

00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,068
what guarantee do you have
that they'll sell it?

00:35:06,135 --> 00:35:07,403
Well, there's no guarantee.

00:35:07,469 --> 00:35:09,705
What happens
if they don't sell any?

00:35:09,772 --> 00:35:13,642
And you're stuck with them
as the exclusive for one year.

00:35:13,709 --> 00:35:15,144
Well ,you know, Hanna and I--

00:35:15,211 --> 00:35:16,979
You should never
do a deal like that.

00:35:17,046 --> 00:35:18,214
Right.

00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,082
There's no performance metrics
in that deal?

00:35:20,149 --> 00:35:23,419
They said they--We expected
150 to 200 accounts.

00:35:23,485 --> 00:35:25,221
Yeah, talk is cheap.
I expect that, too.
Right.

00:35:25,287 --> 00:35:26,589
But if they don't deliver,
what happens?

00:35:26,655 --> 00:35:28,324
Well, I mean,
if they don't deliver,

00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:30,593
we have, you know, I mean--
Guess what.

00:35:30,659 --> 00:35:32,661
You'll never do a deal
like that again.

00:35:32,728 --> 00:35:34,997
You're gonna learn
the hard way.

00:35:35,064 --> 00:35:36,398
(mark) Where are you guys
selling these now?

00:35:36,465 --> 00:35:37,967
Which stores?
What kind of stores?

00:35:38,033 --> 00:35:39,969
Mostly baby stores,
kids clothing stores...
baby stores.

00:35:40,035 --> 00:35:41,837
And some gift shops even.

00:35:41,904 --> 00:35:43,038
And--And where are
you holding

00:35:43,105 --> 00:35:44,840
the inventory that you have
for this?

00:35:44,907 --> 00:35:46,675
(mark and Hanna) In our garage.
(chuckles)
In your garage, huh?

00:35:46,742 --> 00:35:48,477
And you guys have been
shipping them yourselves?

00:35:48,544 --> 00:35:50,913
Oh, that's a nighttime activity.
Yeah. (laughs)

00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,281
You don't even know.
Right now, we don't sleep.

00:35:52,348 --> 00:35:55,150
We assemble cups
in our living room.

00:35:55,217 --> 00:35:58,454
I love this.
I think this is a great idea.

00:35:58,521 --> 00:36:01,290
It's really not my market,

00:36:01,357 --> 00:36:04,260
and, um, so I wish you
the best of luck with it,

00:36:04,326 --> 00:36:05,294
but I'm out.

00:36:13,068 --> 00:36:14,803
Let me just start things off
with an offer,

00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,839
because this is
the new sippy cup.

00:36:16,906 --> 00:36:19,008
I agree with you. You've done
a fantastic job.

00:36:19,074 --> 00:36:21,210
My offer's contingent.

00:36:21,277 --> 00:36:22,978
I'm gonna give you $100,000

00:36:23,045 --> 00:36:26,582
for 50% of the company.

00:36:26,649 --> 00:36:29,251
You have to source this
offshore

00:36:29,318 --> 00:36:31,453
and get the price
below 2 bucks

00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,122
to make this work.

00:36:33,189 --> 00:36:36,125
Then we're going to sell
<i>millions </i>of them.

00:36:36,192 --> 00:36:38,294
What do you want to do?

00:36:40,596 --> 00:36:43,532
♪♪♪

00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:52,834

00:36:52,901 --> 00:36:55,470
<i>One shark is out.</i>

00:36:55,537 --> 00:36:58,072
<i>Hanna and mark have an offer</i>

What do you want to do?

00:37:05,713 --> 00:37:08,983
Are there, uh, any offers
that are being entertained?

00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:11,286
Tell me more about
your, um, sales agent

00:37:11,352 --> 00:37:12,353
and what your deal us.

00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,489
As I said,
we just signed with them.

00:37:14,556 --> 00:37:18,093
And so they're
in a trade show right now.

00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:19,427
What I'm trying
to figure out is,

00:37:19,494 --> 00:37:21,996
all right you able to continue
to go out and sell?

00:37:22,063 --> 00:37:23,665
Are we able
to go out and sell?

00:37:23,731 --> 00:37:26,234
What are your limitations
and what are your opportunities?

00:37:26,301 --> 00:37:27,235
I mean, there's no limitations.

00:37:27,302 --> 00:37:29,037
There--We--We still go sell.

00:37:29,104 --> 00:37:30,405
I mean, we--we don't wait
for them. And they--they don't--

00:37:30,472 --> 00:37:33,108
Now do you have to run that sale
back through the sales agent?

00:37:33,174 --> 00:37:34,409
Right now, yes.

00:37:34,476 --> 00:37:36,444
Okay, and what do you have
to pay the sales agent?

00:37:36,511 --> 00:37:37,512
We're paying them 15%.

00:37:39,247 --> 00:37:41,749
Wow. Is that for a specific
geographic area?

00:37:41,816 --> 00:37:44,252
Uh. It's just--It's the U.S.

00:37:44,319 --> 00:37:45,720
The entire U.S. Right now.
Yes.

00:37:45,787 --> 00:37:47,155
Mm-Hmm.

00:37:47,222 --> 00:37:49,390
Uh, let me just go a little bit
sideways for a second.

00:37:49,457 --> 00:37:53,495
I've been--I've been an investor
in, uh, this sector for a while,

00:37:53,561 --> 00:37:56,698
and my, uh, my heinie Kicked
pretty badly.

00:37:56,765 --> 00:38:01,236
Here's what I learned about
the baby niche market like this.

00:38:01,302 --> 00:38:04,105
To make any real money,

00:38:04,172 --> 00:38:06,141
you've gotta go
to general distribution,

00:38:06,207 --> 00:38:07,976
like every other product.

00:38:08,042 --> 00:38:09,110
What's your thought on that?

00:38:09,177 --> 00:38:11,012
I think our sales strategy
really--

00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:12,447
which we've seen in products

00:38:12,514 --> 00:38:14,249
that we end up buying
at target--

00:38:14,315 --> 00:38:15,416
We see them in the hands

00:38:15,483 --> 00:38:17,585
of trendsetters
and tastemakers first,

00:38:17,652 --> 00:38:18,987
and that's where we want them.

00:38:19,053 --> 00:38:21,122
And then eventually, we see them
coming down to target,

00:38:21,189 --> 00:38:23,091
and then we do it.
I don't disagree
with the strategy,

00:38:23,158 --> 00:38:26,761
especially since the obstacle
I see is the sales agent.

00:38:26,828 --> 00:38:27,996
Okay.
I don't wanna help you

00:38:28,062 --> 00:38:29,764
go get that $10 million order
tomorrow,

00:38:29,831 --> 00:38:31,433
or million-Unit order,

00:38:31,499 --> 00:38:33,368
and have to give 15%
off the top of that,

00:38:33,435 --> 00:38:34,569
of the work that we did,

00:38:34,636 --> 00:38:36,104
right.
Right.

00:38:36,171 --> 00:38:39,908
I've had the industrial designer
wanna invest.

00:38:39,974 --> 00:38:42,277
I've--Our manufacturer
wants to invest.

00:38:42,343 --> 00:38:43,311
My--My--
So if they all wanna invest,

00:38:43,378 --> 00:38:46,147
you've been walking away
from money to come here?

00:38:46,214 --> 00:38:47,482
I wanna play with winners.

00:38:47,549 --> 00:38:50,185
I wanna be with guys that I know
will--Will help us--

00:38:50,251 --> 00:38:51,419
But you have an offer
on the table.

00:38:51,486 --> 00:38:52,420
You don't have to leave
with nothing.

00:38:52,487 --> 00:38:54,022
Right.

00:38:54,088 --> 00:38:55,690
You're waiting for somebody else
to step up. It seems no one has.

00:38:55,757 --> 00:38:57,659
I['m interested in a deal.

00:38:57,725 --> 00:39:00,395
I'm gonna match
Voldemort's deal.

00:39:02,397 --> 00:39:04,232
$100,000 for 15%
of the company,

00:39:04,299 --> 00:39:08,670
contingent that you can get out
of your sales agreement deal.

00:39:08,736 --> 00:39:10,472
Okay.
I don't have that contingency.

00:39:10,538 --> 00:39:13,575
I'll meet with that person
and motivate them myself

00:39:13,641 --> 00:39:15,410
my own special way.

00:39:15,477 --> 00:39:16,744
(laughs)
(laughs)

00:39:16,811 --> 00:39:18,580
(laughs) I'm sure you will.
Um, and, daymond, are you--

00:39:18,646 --> 00:39:20,448
is this the same requirements--
We take the price point down,

00:39:20,515 --> 00:39:23,351
do an overseas
manufacturing-Type thing?

00:39:23,418 --> 00:39:25,587
If you can get
the price point down

00:39:25,653 --> 00:39:27,622
and Buybuy baby says, "listen,
I'll put it in my circular,"

00:39:27,689 --> 00:39:30,191
I'll--We'll let them dictate it.
We just may not get an order.

00:39:30,258 --> 00:39:32,160
Okay.
And then we'll have to
decide from there.

00:39:32,227 --> 00:39:36,064
(mark l.) okay.
It is really about
this--This agent.

00:39:36,131 --> 00:39:38,333
Mark, what are you doing here?

00:39:38,399 --> 00:39:39,834
Trying to figure out
what I'm gonna do.

00:39:39,901 --> 00:39:41,970
You know, not all deals
are easy.

00:39:42,036 --> 00:39:44,672
You know, guys, the sales agency
thing is problematic,

00:39:44,739 --> 00:39:46,407
but it's the past.
It's happened.

00:39:46,474 --> 00:39:47,642
You gotta let that run out.

00:39:47,709 --> 00:39:50,445
In--In eight short months.
In eight short months.

00:39:50,512 --> 00:39:52,981
(laughs) In eight sh--Now when
you write a check for $100,000,

00:39:53,047 --> 00:39:55,416
there's no such thing
as eight short months. Yeah.
(Lori) Yeah.

00:39:55,483 --> 00:39:57,652
Mark, you know that
the value is wrong.

00:39:57,719 --> 00:39:59,721
You know the value's wrong.

00:39:59,788 --> 00:40:01,489
Why don't you throw
another number back at me?

00:40:01,556 --> 00:40:04,392
I mean, these offers are
ridiculous. You know that.

00:40:04,459 --> 00:40:06,394
Right.
But why don't you throw
a number back at me?

00:40:06,461 --> 00:40:08,229
These offers are not ridiculous.
'cause they're real offers.

00:40:08,296 --> 00:40:10,432
No real offer's ridiculous.
You know that.

00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,501
(exhales deeply)

00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,969
okay. Um...

00:40:16,404 --> 00:40:17,672
would you be willing to do

00:40:17,739 --> 00:40:20,642
$100,000 for 40%?

00:40:22,811 --> 00:40:25,180
Yes. Done.

00:40:25,246 --> 00:40:26,347
(chuckles)

00:40:26,414 --> 00:40:27,916
Shake on it?
(Lori laughs)

00:40:27,982 --> 00:40:29,517
Do we have a deal?

00:40:29,584 --> 00:40:31,486
Well, I, you know,
I have to respect...

00:40:31,553 --> 00:40:33,121
'cause we're--He just
asked me a question...
(Kevin) Not so fast.

00:40:33,188 --> 00:40:34,589
So I to respect... (laughs)
(Hanna laughs)

00:40:34,656 --> 00:40:36,357
Sit down.
(daymond) Sit down!
Get back on the bench!

00:40:36,424 --> 00:40:38,093
Just one shot. One shot.

00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:40,528
(mark c.) if I walk back here...
This is--This is
a-a one-Shot deal?

00:40:40,595 --> 00:40:41,896
One-Shot deal.
(daymond) Can I--

00:40:41,963 --> 00:40:43,531
can we get two seconds
to talk to my wife?

00:40:43,598 --> 00:40:45,767
You can talk all you want,
but if I walk back there...
right.

00:40:45,834 --> 00:40:47,669
Can you stand there then
for about...
(sharks laughs)

00:40:47,735 --> 00:40:50,338
Please. Respectfully.
About 30 seconds?

00:40:50,405 --> 00:40:51,940
You know what?
I'm a basketball guy.
Right.

00:40:52,006 --> 00:40:53,341
I'm gonna give you
a 24-Second clock.

00:40:53,408 --> 00:40:56,444
24 seconds. Okay.
(Robert) Mark,
do you really--Really--

00:40:56,511 --> 00:40:57,812
How rude is that?
Right.

00:40:57,879 --> 00:40:59,013
I'm not even finished talking,
and the guy gets up.

00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,515
I mean.... mark...
right.

00:41:00,582 --> 00:41:02,517
15 seconds left.

00:41:02,584 --> 00:41:03,985
I'll do the same deal--30%.

00:41:04,052 --> 00:41:05,687
(Lori) Oh, you've got
all these offers.
(Kevin) Whoa!

00:41:05,753 --> 00:41:07,355
Well, hang on.
What happened there?

00:41:07,422 --> 00:41:09,023
I just said I'll do
the same deal for 30%.
Hey, wait a second.

00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:10,291
I just beat mark's deal.
Right.

00:41:10,358 --> 00:41:11,826
Did you just undercut mark
and...
yep.

00:41:11,893 --> 00:41:14,429
And the offer I was gonna...
I don't know your offer.

00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:16,197
You keep mumbling over there.

00:41:16,264 --> 00:41:20,235
Well, I-I was gonna accept
the offer at $100,000 for 40%,

00:41:20,301 --> 00:41:21,903
and then mark just got up
and, uh...

00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:24,472
how about this? Would you--
your deal's over?

00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:26,074
Mark, would you be willing
to work with Robert?

00:41:26,141 --> 00:41:27,742
Because, really, we would really
like your expertise.

00:41:27,809 --> 00:41:29,110
(daymond) guys, I gave you
a great offer.

00:41:29,177 --> 00:41:30,311
Hey! I gave you a great offer,

00:41:30,378 --> 00:41:31,746
but you took too long,
so I'm out.

00:41:33,181 --> 00:41:35,049
Okay.

00:41:36,551 --> 00:41:38,419
Okay.
Mark, would you be willing
to go in with Robert?

00:41:38,486 --> 00:41:41,356
Because we would love to have
both of your expertise.

00:41:41,422 --> 00:41:43,925
I thought when you sat down,
it was over.

00:41:46,461 --> 00:41:49,197
Sometimes I reconsider.
Um, for 40%?

00:41:49,264 --> 00:41:50,398
Yes.

00:41:50,465 --> 00:41:52,400
Robert,
are you cool with that?

00:41:52,467 --> 00:41:55,069
(mark c. And Lori laugh)

00:41:55,136 --> 00:41:57,172
Come on, Robert. It's 40%.

00:41:57,238 --> 00:42:00,508
That means 50k for each of us, 
20% for each of us.

00:42:01,843 --> 00:42:03,645
I'm in.

00:42:03,711 --> 00:42:05,246
All right. Okay.

00:42:05,313 --> 00:42:06,448
First, gotta shake your hand.

00:42:06,514 --> 00:42:07,816
There you go.
All right, man. Yeah.

00:42:07,882 --> 00:42:08,950
Congratulations.
Thank you.

00:42:09,017 --> 00:42:10,318
Good job, guys. Thank you.
Thank you.

00:42:10,385 --> 00:42:11,920
(Lori) Love your parenting.
Good luck.
Good job, man.

00:42:11,986 --> 00:42:13,421
(mark l. And Hanna Laughing)

00:42:13,488 --> 00:42:15,290
Thank you. Thanks.
We're gonna be awesome.

00:42:15,356 --> 00:42:18,493
Hanna, you could've hugged me,
you didn't have to hug mark.

00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,929
(laughs)
I-I have exclusivity here.
You know... (laughs)

00:42:20,995 --> 00:42:24,399
(sharks laughing)

00:42:24,466 --> 00:42:27,402
Oh, they're great.
They're a great couple.

00:42:27,469 --> 00:42:30,472
I mean, right at this moment,
I--We're on cloud nine.

00:42:30,538 --> 00:42:33,174
But I think it's just motivation
to work even Harder.

00:42:33,241 --> 00:42:34,476
Right.
