00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:06,306
<i>America has to offer.</i>

00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:08,175
The only thing
that really matters--

00:00:08,242 --> 00:00:10,010
what is it?
Money.

00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:12,145
<i>If the sharks hear</i>
<i>a great idea,</i>

00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:15,148
<i>they're ready to invest</i>
<i>using their own money...</i>

00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:17,351
how did this idiot make his way
into the shark tank?

00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:19,052
This is absurd.

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,188
<i>And fight each other</i>
<i>for a piece of the action.</i>

00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:22,422

00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:26,093
one of the biggest mistakes
salespeople make. You blew it.

00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:29,029
<i>But first, the entrepreneurs</i>
<i>must convince a shark</i>

00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:31,198
<i>to invest the full amount</i>
<i>they're asking for</i>

00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:33,400
<i>or they'll walk away</i>

I'm not interested

00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:36,270

My name's Steve gadlin

00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:38,999
and I live
in Evanston, illinois.

00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:43,036
(bird chirps)
I live a really normal life.

00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,206
I'm a dad. I'm a husband.
I love my family.

00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:49,209
I work a 9-to-5 job
Building web sites.

00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,044
A lot of that's
just sitting at a computer

00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,379
staring at code all day.

00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:55,415
So I think it's important
to fill your daily life

00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:59,186
with strangeness,
with exciting things.

00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:01,288
I'm an ideas guy.

00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:04,191
I think of really cool,
interesting ideas.

00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:08,362
A lot of my ideas
come to me in the bathroom,

00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,130
and I think that's--

00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:11,999
that's the voice
you really need to listen to.

00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:16,403
So I have a product that on its
surface SEEMS really simple,

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,239
but there is
absolutely nothing like this

00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,308
on the market anywhere
right now.

00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:24,211
The first time you see it,
you're gonna roll your eyes,

00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:25,379
you're gonna think,
"Nobody needs this,

00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:26,980
nobody wants this."

00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:28,348
But you think about it
for two minutes,

00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:30,984
and you're gonna buy one.

00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:53,267
by now, I'm sure
you're asking yourself,

"How did this idiot make his way

00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,005
Well, let me tell you.

00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,073
There is an economy
for stupid,

00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,309
and I am overflowing with it.

00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:05,179
Now with their universal appeal,
my cat Drawings

00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,148
are poised to be
the next pet rock.

00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:12,152
I charge people $9.95
for my cat Drawings.

00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:14,221
$9.32 of that is--
is profit.

00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:17,324
I took the liberty of drawing
some cats for each of you--

00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:20,160
ones I thought you might order
if you came to my web site.

00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:23,363
So, Robert, I know
you're into fast Cars.
Thank you, Steve.

00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,300

00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:34,107
Damon, here's a fancy man
about the town,

00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:37,344
and, mark, congratulations
on your championship.
Thank you, sir.

00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,148
I have customers Who've bought
enough of these drawings

00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:43,250
to start their own
cat drawing Gallery.

00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:44,318
Why are people buying them?

00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,386
People ask for
their dead pets.

00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:49,122
They want to draw
about their breakup,

00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:50,290
or sometimes I have

00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:53,227
cats fighting an octopus
and a t-Rex on the moon.

00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,963
So they try to test you for,
like, bizarro stuff, too.

00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,064
Yeah. Part of it is, hey,

00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,298
they know This is gonna go up
on the web site.

00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,167
They want to show off
their crazy idea.

00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:02,369
So you post
all these drawings...
every single one.

00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:04,938
On the web site.
Yeah, an then they
share them with their friends,

00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:06,373
and their friends come
and they purchase cat drawings

00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,108
to outdo one another.

00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:10,177
Um, and there's some people
who take this very seriously.

00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:11,345
You draw these yourself?

00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,180
I draw these myself.

00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:14,348
I sit down at a table,

00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:17,217
and I-I take this person's
very personal request,

00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:19,987
uh, let it play around
in my head for about a minute,

00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,989
and then I can knock one of
these out in about two minutes.

00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:24,391
How leveragable is that?
How many can you draw in a day?

00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,960
I can draw about 25 of these
in an hour,

00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:29,196
uh, in a week I can knock out
about 1,000 of these.

00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:31,365
But that's just with me
doing this by myself.

00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:33,166
You know,
as this business grows,

00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:34,334
because of the profit margin,

00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:36,203
it starts to pay
for its own growth.

00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,072
So the really nice thing about
this is I'm a web developer.

00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,341
When I'm not drawing cats,
I'm building web sites.

00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:43,143
So I don't have that overhead

00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,245
that any other company
would have.
So what are your sales today?

00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:48,315
Okay, I've sold over, uh,
1,200 of these cats.
In what period of time?

00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:51,018
This is about a year.

00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,987
Steve, what do you do with
my $10,000 if I give it to you?

00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:55,355
What I'd first like to do

00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:57,224
is build on my
e-Commerce platform that I have

00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,392
and grow it
even further.

00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,061
Uh, the other thing I wanna do
is start dabbling

00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:02,196
into things
like greeting cards.

00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,933
I love the shtick.
I love the Dancing.

00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:07,968
Barbara was getting excited
when you turned your behind.

00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:10,304
Not True!
So it's all very exciting,

00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,408
but how does this go
from $9,000 to $100,000?

00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,043
Well,
here's the leap of Faith.

00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,277
Working with me on this,

00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:19,413
you're partnering with one of
the most creative minds, period.

00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,015
I strike gold in Very
unpredictable ways.

00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:24,151
What you guys bring to that
is the business acumen

00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:27,154
to take those ideas, we have
a fun little marriage there,

00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:30,190
and I believe my ideas
are billion-dollar ideas.
But, Steve, the problem is

00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:32,159
every business model
is all about Steve.

00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:34,161
Nothing wrong with that,
but what happens

00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:35,229
if you're walking outside

00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:39,399
and a meteorite crushes you
into road pizza?

00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,301
Steve, you've convinced me
you're a very creative guy.

00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:45,072
But am I buying into
Steve the creative guy

00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:48,075
and taking a leap of faith
and saying "Let's go, baby,

00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:49,343
we'll figure out
the business tomorrow"?

00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:53,280
or am I--are you trying
to sell me the cat business?

00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:55,082
I'm trying to sell you
the cat business

00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,917
and a partnership
with me.

00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:59,386
Um, I-I have so many ideas
which will seem

00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:02,256
at face Value
equally as stupid as this.

00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,259
It's obvious that P.R.
Is the big push,

00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:06,393
'cause you're not out there
spending money

00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,928
to drive people
to your website, right?

00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:10,097
Yeah, there are
no cat drawing Fairs or...

00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:13,066
so tell me about
the publicity, uh, process.

00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,169
So I'm a real hustler
for everything I do.

00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:17,237
I tend to bring a lot
of press attention to what I do,

00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:18,272
on a local level.

00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:20,007
I e-mailed groupon.

00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:22,075
I knew they had a cat mascot,
and I said, "Hey, I draw cats,

00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:23,410
do you guys wanna do
a groupon for this?"

00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:25,245
I got a response
the next day,

00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:28,248
and then, uh, you know,
on black Friday we launched it,

00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,117
and it was, uh, one of their
most successful--

00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:32,052
it sold out very quickly.
Um...

00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,087
and how many
did you commit to do?

00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:36,089
Well, the nice thing
about groupon is, uh,

00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:37,357
1,000 people said,
"I'm buying."

00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:39,193
But only about half of them

00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:41,094
ever actually redeemed
those groupons.
So you got to keep the money?

00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:44,298
Exactly.
Look, very interesting.
Really small dollars.

00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:46,266
Not investable
from my point of View.

00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,402
Can I tell you something,
Kevin?

00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,404
You know what
I'd love to say?
No, let him go out!
Just Let him go out!

00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,105
But I want you
to go out,

00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:53,173
and then I want you to go back
to your hotel tonight,

00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,975
put your head
on your Pillow.

00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:56,310
I promise you the last thing
That's going through your head

00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,011
before you go to sleep is...

I'm out.

00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:07,321
Okay. I accept--I accept it,
and I'd like to counter,

00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:09,423
if I could.
(laughter)

00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:14,294
So, Steve, you've done
a phenomenal job

00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:16,296
of free P.R.,

00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:19,166
but does it worry you that
after all this P.R.,

00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:22,236
that the net result
is $7,000?

00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,273
I'm out.

00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,009
These guys
just don't get it.

00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:31,311
I get it.
I love your Creativity.
Thank you.

00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:34,314
I'll give you 25 grand
for 33%. Just say "Yes."

00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:41,388
25 grand, 33%.
Oh, man.

00:08:41,455 --> 00:08:43,090
'cause if you don't--
if you say "No,"

00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:44,224
that means you don't
really wanna work.

00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:50,998
I'm interested.
I'm interested. Hold on.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:53,033
I'm the one
that knows technology.
Don't fall
for this dirty trick.

00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,168
I'm the one who gets it.
He's done it before.

00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:56,203
I'm not gonna go
in a bidding war With cat guy.

00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,371
Steve, you gotta
make a call here!

00:08:57,437 --> 00:09:00,073
Now, mark, I would love
to partner with you on this.

00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,209
I wanna ask one thing.
What's that?

00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:04,144
Maybe 1 in 1,000 cats,

00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:05,946
will you pitch in
and draw it for me?

00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:06,947
Yes.

00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:08,048
You got a deal.

00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:10,217
Done!

00:09:10,284 --> 00:09:13,954

(Barbara) No, it's not.
It's good.

00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:27,301
Oh! (laughs)

00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,236

Congratulations.

Thanks, Steve.
All right. Thank you so much,
mark. Take care.

talented people like that...
yep.

(Barbara) Mm.
That have the vision
and have the guts...

00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:48,121
and the enthusiasm.
Like the guts to go,
"this guy's the guy."

You're gonna make a lot
of money with him.
I love it.

00:10:23,257 --> 00:10:25,058
My name is Dave Greco

00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,261
and my business
is the salespreneur.

00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,296
And I'm seeking
a $90,000 investment

00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:32,332
in exchange for 40% equity
in my firm.

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,068
And I'm an expert
sales professional.

00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,204
I could sell anything
to anyone,

00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:39,173
and I've always
hit my quota.

00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:42,409
Been in the top 2% of every firm
I've ever worked for.

00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,344
And I've won
every sales performance award

00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:45,412
there is to win.

00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:48,048
When I was 5 years old,

00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:50,150
I would sell pencils
out of my parents' house

00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:52,386
for 10 cents a piece
to my neighbors.

00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:54,221
I've been selling
ever Since.

00:10:54,288 --> 00:10:56,456
That's why I created
the salespreneur system.

00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:58,425
I've developed a system
to get you

00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:02,062
in front of the real Decision
maker who can make the buy,

00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:04,097
who can say "Yes."

00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:07,301
Now our system consists
of two critical components--

00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:09,369
the first is missile--

00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:12,506
a razor-sharp
step-by-Step system

00:11:12,573 --> 00:11:16,410
which teaches you how to find,
get in front of,

00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:20,214
and what to say
to your original buyer.

00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,383
Second is roadmapp--
an INDUSTRY-specific guide

00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,352
which teaches you

00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:27,354
how to frame your pitch
to your audience

00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:29,223
once you're inside
and in front of them.

00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:32,526
We're successfully deployed
in several companies

00:11:32,593 --> 00:11:34,127
and we want to sell it

00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:37,064
through a downloadable
mobile Application.

00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:40,133
Great salespeople
are trained, not born.

00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,337
Give me a "C" Performer
with a solid work ethic,

00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:45,472
and I promise you my system

00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,441
will teach them
to close more deals

00:11:47,508 --> 00:11:50,344
than the smartest person
in any room.

00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,213
Salespreneur is <i>the </i>tool

00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,083
which helps sales professionals
in any industry.

00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:58,118
Dave, you're trying
to sell me the idea

00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:00,487
that you can make anybody
into a great salesman?

00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:02,189
That's it.

00:12:02,256 --> 00:12:05,392
I'm here for one reason--
to close this deal.

00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:08,228
What questions
can I answer for you?

00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:09,496
How much have you sold?

00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,398
$40,000...
dollars worth?

00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:14,168
In the last three months.
And how many organizations?

00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,171
We're in 5 organizations,
and 3 of the fortune 300.

00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,106
Can you walk us through
the business models?

00:12:19,173 --> 00:12:20,374
How do you get paid?
Right now,

00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,276
me or somebody
from my team will go out

00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:24,278
and teach the system.

00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:25,379
Then we sell them

00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:29,049
the actual booklets
that you see in print.

00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:32,085
All right. You've got
three "Fortune" Accounts...
correct.

00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:36,290
And you've only sold, between
the 3 of them, $40,000?

00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:38,058
We've only been selling
three months.

00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,194
And what's a typical sale?
Break down a sale for me.

00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,197
A typical sale would be anywhere
between 10 to 20 people

00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:46,099
in a room, where--
and so they each buy a book?

00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,434
They each buy a book.
It's per seat.

00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:50,070
(Barbara) Who's in those seats?
The sales reps.

00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:54,341
Corporations buying
the books?
The corporations are buying
the system for their people.

00:12:54,408 --> 00:12:56,310
What percentage increase,
on average,

00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:58,245
am I gonna get
in increased sales

00:12:58,312 --> 00:13:00,147
because they took your system?

00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:01,415
At least 40%.

00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,150
40%?

00:13:03,217 --> 00:13:06,186
40%. And here--
David, if you really can
increase sales 40%,

00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:09,456
why haven't you sold
thousands?
He's only been
in business three months!

00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:11,058
He's only got one guy.

00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,093
We're deployed
in a fortune 100--

00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,462
one of the largest insurance
companies in the world.

00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:16,463
What company?

00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,464
Met life.

00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:19,399
And met life Only bought
how many books?

00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:23,170
We've sold 140 units
at $2.95 apiece.

00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:24,505
Now we want to scale
the company

00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:26,507
and take it to
a mobile application

00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:28,141
and a video game.

00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,277
Whoa, whoa, Dave.
Before we scale the company

00:13:30,344 --> 00:13:33,046
and go into a mobile app
and... do all that,

00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:36,049
if you were truly integrated
within met Life's program,

00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:38,151
they have over 100,000
salespeople, don't they?

00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:40,087
I mean...
that's the opportunity.

00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,422
Why do you want to do
mobile apps?
Because--
I wanna do mobile apps

00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:45,092
because it's more
predictive cash flow.

00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,227
I can measure the lifetime
value of my customer that way.
Okay, David,

00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:48,529
but isn't the real
opportunity of it to sell more

00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:51,398
to the fortune 100 accounts?
There is, absolutely.

00:13:51,465 --> 00:13:53,133
But I can't be
everywhere at once,

00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,068
and I don't want
to be everywhere at once.

00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:56,336
David, is not what
you're really selling today,

00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:58,305
you're selling yourself?
Not at all.

00:13:58,372 --> 00:14:00,440
I'm selling my system
and my intellectual capital.

00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:01,508
Because what we've done is,

00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:03,243
we've trademarked
and copy written

00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,444
all of our material here.

00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:08,115
So it's basically,
the secret sauce is right here.

00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:10,217
And if you deploy this
and you follow it,

00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:11,385
it's like a diet.

00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:13,387
We have a company in Boston,
a small start-up,

00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,489
that just got
their second round of funding,

00:14:15,556 --> 00:14:18,392
and we just took their sales
from $30 to $60 million.

00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:23,163
May I see that
secret sauce a minute?
How can you have done that
in three months?

00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,332
Robert, you should partner
with me to find out.

00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:26,466
(laughs)

00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,101
This guy's a salesman.

00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:29,436
Being a salesperson's
about being adaptive.

00:14:29,503 --> 00:14:31,305
Do me a favor, David.
Can you sell me this pen?

00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,141
Sell us this pen
right here.
Absolutely.

00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,276
So, daymond,
thank you for your time.

00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:38,478
I've got a great product
for you today,

00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:41,048
and it's this beautiful
pen right here.

00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:43,150
So the features of it
are it's shiny,

00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:44,518
it's gonna fit nice
in your hand,

00:14:44,585 --> 00:14:46,253

impressed

but the impact
that you're missing

00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:51,091
is that this pen is gonna
help change your life,

00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:53,160
because when you sign
your deal with me,

00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:55,028
you're gonna be
a very wealthy man,

00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:57,264
wealthier than you are
right now.

00:14:57,331 --> 00:15:00,067
This pen--and this is where
everybody gets confused--

00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:02,135
people--
sell it to me.
Sell it to me. Keep selling.

00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:04,137
People focus on
the features and benefits.
Tell me when you're done
with the sale.

00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:05,138
I just wanna see
if I'm impressed.

00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:06,406
That was it?
That's it.

00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:08,375
Well, you haven't gone
for the close yet.
The Impact--

00:15:08,442 --> 00:15:12,145
the Impact is you
inking the deal with me.
But, David, isn't--

00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:13,313
oh, wait, wait, wait, Stop.

00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,350
Hated it. I'm out.

00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:20,187

daymond. You're out.

00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:22,356
You'll do me a favor
and talk to them.
(mark laughs)

00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:25,125
David, look,
I-I know you can sell.

00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:28,061
But the issue is,
today you're selling yourself.

00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:32,366
To sell a mobile app that you're
not in front of me selling,

00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,168
you've gotta have
a sense of credibility.

00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:36,303
You've gotta have a book.
You've gotta have something.

00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:39,206
There's gotta be something
that makes me download that app.
Well, I have to
start somewhere.

00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:40,507
So let me tell you
what "Somewhere" Looks like.

00:15:40,574 --> 00:15:44,244
We've got a production company
ready, willing, and able

00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:46,446

00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:48,282
I invested my own money.

00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:49,349
I mortgaged my house

00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,285
and I have
a second Lien on my house.

00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:52,386
Who cares?

00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:57,124
Dave, there's a huge
hunger in America

00:15:57,191 --> 00:15:58,492
for people that can sell.

00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:01,228
I don't--
I don't disagree that there's
a seminar business

00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:03,363
that you could do.
You can sell <i>you.</i>

00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:08,368
But I-I'm just not buying
going from you to a mobile app.

00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:09,536
I'm out.

00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:13,340
Give me one company
that has successfully

00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:16,076
provided a mobile app
that increases sales.

00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:17,377
None. I want to be
the first.

00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:19,346
Yeah, but that's my point.
The risk is huge on that.

00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:23,050
I don't think my $90,000
is Well invested

00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:24,384

into a mobile app.

You know what I think?
I think you're going too fast.

00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:37,491
I totally believe
your material is great.

00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:39,459
I really combed through it.

00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:41,862
But any time you go into
any kind of a mobile app,

00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:43,797
I have learned it costs you
so much more

00:17:43,864 --> 00:17:45,899
than you ever envisioned.

00:17:45,966 --> 00:17:47,868
I think you should stick
with what you're doing.

00:17:47,935 --> 00:17:49,803
It's too much too fast.

00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,572

00:17:52,873 --> 00:17:54,508
Thank you.

00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:03,650
Mr. Cuban...

00:18:03,717 --> 00:18:06,553
what do we need to do
right now to ink a deal?

00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,623
Because you know
and I know this can work.

00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:17,764
I want it to sink in on you
very, very hard...

00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:22,569
so it just reverberates
through your whole body.

00:18:22,636 --> 00:18:25,672
What was my last question
to you?

00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:28,575
Would I take
the $90,000 for 40%?

00:18:28,642 --> 00:18:30,744
You had a chance to close,
didn't you?

00:18:30,811 --> 00:18:33,614
And instead you diverted
all your attention...

00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,549
no, I wanted to hear
the room out,

00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:36,850
which is what
the "Shark tank" is all about.

00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:39,586
No, in your particular case,

00:18:39,653 --> 00:18:41,421
the "Shark tank"
Is about selling.

00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:43,757
It's about taking your business
to the next level.

00:18:43,824 --> 00:18:45,826
You about taught
all of America

00:18:45,893 --> 00:18:48,462
one of the biggest mistakes
salespeople make.

00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:49,863
When they have a deal
in front of them,

00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,798
you should just shut up
and take the deal...

00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:53,600
hallelujah.

00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:54,868
Instead of keep on selling.

00:18:54,935 --> 00:18:57,604
And you kept on trying
to sell.

00:18:57,671 --> 00:18:59,806
So do you like the idea?

00:18:59,873 --> 00:19:01,508
Do you think it can work,

00:19:01,575 --> 00:19:02,876
and would you wanna see
a net increase

00:19:02,943 --> 00:19:04,912
of 30 to 50% in your company?

00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:07,648
Again, what was
my question to you?

00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:09,716
Of course I like the deal.

00:19:09,783 --> 00:19:11,585
Of course I like
the opportunity,

00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:13,487
which is why I offered you
a chance to close it.

00:19:13,554 --> 00:19:14,721
The problem is,

00:19:14,788 --> 00:19:16,857
you basically took
the whole thing for granted.

00:19:16,924 --> 00:19:19,626
I didn't take it
for granted, not one bit.

00:19:19,693 --> 00:19:21,895

00:23:18,966 --> 00:23:20,834
I want you to hold
your left hand out.

00:23:20,901 --> 00:23:23,770
I want you to hold this
piece of celery right here.

00:23:23,837 --> 00:23:25,739
Please do not move it.
Now what I'm gonna do is,

00:23:25,806 --> 00:23:26,807
I'm gonna take
one of these playing cards,

00:23:26,874 --> 00:23:28,642
I'm gonna throw it,

00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:31,745
and I'm gonna try to cut
this piece of celery in half.
What?!

00:23:31,812 --> 00:23:33,514
whoa.
Oh, come on.

00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,815
Watch Closely.
Watch the celery.

00:23:36,717 --> 00:23:38,485
There it is.
Whoa!

00:23:38,552 --> 00:23:39,753
Oh, man!

00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,622
Wow.
Hey, can you--can you
help me out for a second?

00:23:41,688 --> 00:23:43,457
Sure.
I want you
to sit right here.

00:23:43,524 --> 00:23:44,825
Actually, can you help me
out, too, for a second?
(Kevin) Sure.

00:23:44,892 --> 00:23:46,627
Come on down here. I want you
to have a seat right here.

00:23:46,693 --> 00:23:47,661
Absolutely.

00:23:47,728 --> 00:23:49,563
I have this lighter
right here.

00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,565
All I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
set your chair on fire.

00:23:51,632 --> 00:23:53,500
Okay.
No, I'm just kidding.

00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:54,668
If you feel anything,
just, um--

00:23:54,735 --> 00:23:56,637
if you just feel
anything at all...
Oh, (bleep)!

00:23:56,703 --> 00:23:59,606
what? What are--
oh! Ow!

00:23:59,673 --> 00:24:00,874
What's wrong!
You zapped me.

00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:02,776
I did not!
(laughter)

00:24:02,843 --> 00:24:05,546
Give me that thing. I'm gonna
light <i>you </i>on fire, Buddy.

00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:07,581
Right now. That's...

00:24:07,648 --> 00:24:09,850
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to burn your behind.

00:24:09,917 --> 00:24:12,853
The opportunity is right here
in front of me

00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,922
to take all
I've learned and experienced

00:24:14,988 --> 00:24:18,492
to the entertainment
capitol of the world, las vegas.

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,593
Okay, Rick,
who just burnt my ass...

00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,827
sorry... (laughs)
I have a question.

00:24:20,894 --> 00:24:21,828
Yes.

00:24:21,895 --> 00:24:24,498
$1.5 million for 20%
of your company

00:24:24,565 --> 00:24:25,799
or your business
or your production...
Yes.

00:24:25,866 --> 00:24:27,434
Means that you're telling me

00:24:27,501 --> 00:24:30,571
that you're worth
$7 1/2 million.

00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:31,805
$7 1/2 million. 
Let's get serious here--

00:24:31,872 --> 00:24:33,574
why?

00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,444
Actually, I'm projecting
to gross $12 million

00:24:37,511 --> 00:24:38,846
in our first year.

00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,682
I'm working with one of the top
publicists in las vegas.

00:24:41,748 --> 00:24:42,916
We've checked out
many different venues

00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:45,819
and we found out
that on the average seating--

00:24:45,886 --> 00:24:47,721
between 400 and 600 seats,

00:24:47,788 --> 00:24:50,490
selling tickets
at a price of $60,

00:24:50,557 --> 00:24:53,560
doing two shows a day,
seven days a week...

00:24:53,627 --> 00:24:54,695
but you haven't
done this yet.

00:24:54,761 --> 00:24:56,697
I have not done a las vegas
production Show.

00:24:56,763 --> 00:24:58,799
(Robert) So you--
right now, I am
currently a magician

00:24:58,866 --> 00:25:00,767
that I travel all over
the country

00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:03,537
doing corporate events,
trade shows.
How much did you make
last year?

00:25:03,604 --> 00:25:05,672
Last year,
I made $200,000.

00:25:05,739 --> 00:25:07,841
And I'm supposed to say
you're worth a million-five

00:25:07,908 --> 00:25:10,477
because maybe in vegas
you're gonna make it?

00:25:10,544 --> 00:25:12,446
You know how many magicians
are in vegas?

00:25:12,513 --> 00:25:14,448
They grow them
like mushrooms there.
There's lots of magicians
in las Vegas.

00:25:14,515 --> 00:25:15,849
Look, Riddle me this, Rick...
Yes.

00:25:15,916 --> 00:25:17,751
Who burnt my ass...
I'm sorry.

00:25:17,818 --> 00:25:19,753
Why don't I just take
my million five

00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,523
and create Mr. Wonderful's
magic show in Vegas--

00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:23,824
'cause I'm taking all the risk
with all the capital?

00:25:23,891 --> 00:25:26,693
I call you up, say, "Hey, Rick,
you wanna work for me?"

00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,730
and I pay you.
$300,000.

00:25:29,796 --> 00:25:32,599
Why do I have to give you,
you know, 80%,

00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:34,468
and I get 20, and I put up
all the money.

00:25:34,535 --> 00:25:35,769
Isn't that what
this whole dig is about?

00:25:35,836 --> 00:25:38,472
The guy that has the money
makes all the rules.

00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:40,774
That's how it works.
Well, I-I...

00:25:40,841 --> 00:25:41,909
you're an employee.
You work for me.

00:25:41,975 --> 00:25:43,544
If I don't like your magic,
I fire you.

00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,679
In fact, I burn your ass.

00:25:45,746 --> 00:25:47,648
To get your money back
right away,

00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:49,449
I was--I was thinking that

00:25:49,516 --> 00:25:51,451
I'd pay you
twice your investment.

00:25:51,518 --> 00:25:52,719
<i>If </i>you even make the money,

00:25:52,786 --> 00:25:55,422
and that's
the million-dollar question.

00:25:55,489 --> 00:25:56,590
If I make the money.

00:25:56,657 --> 00:25:58,492
Rick, the reason
most of these shows don't work

00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,494
and the reason
they're so risky

00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:01,695
is you're not a known brand.

00:26:01,762 --> 00:26:04,598
Nobody knows
Rick the magician.

00:26:04,665 --> 00:26:06,800
I give you the $1.5 million,
you rent the venue,

00:26:06,867 --> 00:26:09,536
the $1.5 million is gone.

00:26:09,603 --> 00:26:10,871
It's gone.

00:26:10,938 --> 00:26:13,473
The day you open,
if people don't know you,

00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,542
I could go to zero.

00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:18,712
That's how all magicians--
every magician in Las vegas...
(laughs)

00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:20,514
No, no, seriously...
but Rick,
before they go to vegas,

00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:21,815
they have a brand. They have
a name. People know them.

00:26:21,882 --> 00:26:23,450
No. That's not--
that's not True.

00:26:23,517 --> 00:26:24,751
Every magician doesn't
have a name going into it.

00:26:24,818 --> 00:26:26,653
They all have pretty much
the same story as I do.

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,923
Why not start
in a smaller town?
I'm really up for anything,

00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,859
but this is--
this is just my dream,

00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:34,828
to be this--this performer.
And you just gave up on
the dream just like that?

00:26:34,895 --> 00:26:38,465
"I'm up for anything." You gave
up on las vegas just like that?

00:26:38,532 --> 00:26:39,633
No, no, no, no.

00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,568
I've been working on this--
this deal right here

00:26:41,635 --> 00:26:43,437
for over three years,
working with This publicist

00:26:43,504 --> 00:26:45,739
who has worked
for major, major...

00:26:45,806 --> 00:26:47,774
Yeah, but publicists just
want you to pay them.
But you pay publicists, Rick.

00:26:47,841 --> 00:26:48,876
Yeah, you just pay
the publicist,

00:26:48,942 --> 00:26:50,611
they'll tell you
whatever you want to hear.

00:26:50,677 --> 00:26:53,714
But the reality is, you know
vegas is incredibly expensive.

00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,850
You know to get into
a decent show room

00:26:56,917 --> 00:26:59,753
costs a lot more than
a million and a half dollars.

00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,723
Right now, the rent for--
for most of the show rooms

00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:05,425
is between
$6,000 and $8,000 a week.

00:27:05,492 --> 00:27:06,660
A week!
A week.

00:27:06,727 --> 00:27:07,794
A week.

00:27:07,861 --> 00:27:10,497
My closest friend is
Siegfried and Roy's manager.

00:27:10,564 --> 00:27:12,666
Okay.
30 years managing them.

00:27:12,733 --> 00:27:15,469
And he manages
other magicians,

00:27:15,536 --> 00:27:17,504
and still Cannot get
anybody else out in vegas

00:27:17,571 --> 00:27:19,806
because how challenging
the market is.

00:27:19,873 --> 00:27:21,775
Now, he's talking--I'm talking
about the guy

00:27:21,842 --> 00:27:24,912
who created magic out there.
Yeah, it's one of the best
shows ever in las vegas.

00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:28,549
This is--
this is absurd. I'm out.

00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:31,618
What you're proposing's
insane.

00:27:31,685 --> 00:27:36,557
I--this isn't even
a-a horrible risk.

00:27:36,623 --> 00:27:39,793
It's an insane risk.
I'm out.

00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,562
You went for
the holy grail.

00:27:41,628 --> 00:27:43,530
You're not quite ready
to go there.

00:27:43,597 --> 00:27:44,831
I just think if
you would have told us

00:27:44,898 --> 00:27:46,800
that we should invest in you,

00:27:46,867 --> 00:27:48,502
and over some period of time,

00:27:48,569 --> 00:27:50,604
we're gonna--we'll grow
with you,

00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:52,439
and we'll help your career
because We're sharks

00:27:52,506 --> 00:27:53,574
and we know how to help...
I--

00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,675
and we'll give you advice.

00:27:54,741 --> 00:27:56,543
But you asked for
a million and a half dollars.

00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:58,645
I ain't gonna write you a check
for a million and a half dollars

00:27:58,712 --> 00:28:00,914
for 20% so I can help
your career go.

00:28:00,981 --> 00:28:03,717
You set your sights high,
but you set them too high.

00:28:03,784 --> 00:28:07,754
And it's not gonna work,
so I'm out.

00:28:07,821 --> 00:28:09,723
Rick, you missed
a fantastic opportunity.

00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:13,727
I've never seen somebody throw
a card that fast. Incredible.

00:28:13,794 --> 00:28:16,563
But I gotta tell you, Rick,
it takes 10 to 15 years

00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,799
to become
an "Overnight success."

00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:21,568
and you're not gonna use
my $1.5 million

00:28:21,635 --> 00:28:24,905
to become an overnight success
with one act. I'm out.

00:28:27,975 --> 00:28:29,910
You're such a cute kid...

00:28:29,977 --> 00:28:30,978
(laughs)

00:28:32,646 --> 00:28:34,615
but you're nuts.

00:28:34,681 --> 00:28:36,717
Came in, asked for too much
too soon

00:28:36,783 --> 00:28:38,919
with Nothing to prove
that you could actually

00:28:38,986 --> 00:28:40,721
even attempt to pull it out.

00:28:40,787 --> 00:28:42,856
Nobody's gonna give you
the money, and I'm out.

00:28:42,923 --> 00:28:45,626
Well, I appreciate
your guys' time,

00:28:45,692 --> 00:28:47,761
and I look forward to seeing
you guys in las vegas.

00:28:47,828 --> 00:28:49,530
Thanks, Guys.
Thank you.

00:28:49,596 --> 00:28:50,597
(Barbara) Bye-Bye.

00:28:50,664 --> 00:28:52,499
My las vegas dreams
are not over.

00:28:52,566 --> 00:28:54,768
I'm going to continue to look
for an investment

00:28:54,835 --> 00:28:57,571
so we can actually
make this dream Happen.

Hello.
My name is Donny Mccall.

00:29:22,029 --> 00:29:23,897
My company is invis-a-rack,

00:29:23,964 --> 00:29:26,033
and our flagship product
is the invis-a-rack

00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:27,901
innovative Cargo
management system.

00:29:27,968 --> 00:29:30,003
I'm seeking $100,000

00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:32,873
in exchange for 10% equity
in my company.

00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,843
Now it's because of my wife
that I'm here today

00:29:35,909 --> 00:29:37,978
and have created
such an incredible product.

00:29:38,045 --> 00:29:41,148
You see, I own a construction
company in my small town,

00:29:41,215 --> 00:29:44,818
and I use my truck both
personally and professionally.

00:29:44,885 --> 00:29:46,053
And there are times
when I need to carry

00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:48,822
longer material and equipment
to the job sites,

00:29:48,889 --> 00:29:49,923
but not every day.

00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:52,159
Well, the only solution has been
a permanent rack

00:29:52,226 --> 00:29:53,994
that is always up
and in the way.

00:29:54,061 --> 00:29:57,097
(chuckles) Well, my wife said
she wasn't gonna ride with me

00:29:57,164 --> 00:29:58,966
if I had a rack on my truck

00:29:59,032 --> 00:30:00,968
and it looked like a work truck
all the time.

00:30:01,034 --> 00:30:02,936
Well, one day I was driving down
the BLUE Ridge parkway

00:30:03,003 --> 00:30:04,238
and I was inspired.

00:30:04,304 --> 00:30:06,073
Now I wasn't trying
to create anything,

00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:09,076
so I believe the lord
handed me this idea.

00:30:14,882 --> 00:30:17,918
(metal sliding and clinking)

00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:21,922
In less than 30 seconds,
my truck can be a transformer.

00:30:25,092 --> 00:30:26,827
(metal clicking)

00:30:26,894 --> 00:30:31,164
I can carry ladders or lumber,
canoes or kayaks

00:30:31,231 --> 00:30:32,866
safely and securely up here,

00:30:32,933 --> 00:30:35,869
while leaving the bed open
for all my other gear.

00:30:35,936 --> 00:30:38,105
And also
in less than 30 seconds...

00:30:38,172 --> 00:30:39,806
(clicking)

00:30:39,873 --> 00:30:42,042
(sliding and clanking)

00:30:42,109 --> 00:30:44,978
I can fold it down, and now
I can take my wife shopping

00:30:45,045 --> 00:30:47,147
or even out on a hot date.

00:30:47,214 --> 00:30:50,817
And so I believe
that invis-a-rack has

00:30:50,884 --> 00:30:52,920
solved the problems that I faced
and the problems that I believe

00:30:52,986 --> 00:30:56,089
nearly every truck owner
out there faces.

00:30:56,156 --> 00:30:59,860
Now we introduced invis-a-rack
to the market in November 2010

00:30:59,927 --> 00:31:01,094
at the S.E.M.A. Show
in las vegas,

00:31:01,161 --> 00:31:04,831
and we were pretty overwhelmed
by the response that we got.

00:31:04,898 --> 00:31:07,100
Now I'm committed to making
invis-a-rack and its accessories

00:31:07,167 --> 00:31:08,969
in the United States.

00:31:09,036 --> 00:31:11,939
I'm one man trying to do
his best for this country.

00:31:12,005 --> 00:31:14,041
Now... (chuckles)
I know a truck rack's

00:31:14,107 --> 00:31:16,176
not to going to save
the U.S. Economy,

00:31:16,243 --> 00:31:20,113
but I wanna do something
that can bring some jobs

00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:23,917
and some hope
to my small town.

00:31:23,984 --> 00:31:27,988
Now I wanna help my family
and investors financially,

00:31:28,055 --> 00:31:32,092
but also my church, community,
state, and country

00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,961
in any way that I can.

00:31:34,027 --> 00:31:35,796
I believe that
my vast Life experience

00:31:35,863 --> 00:31:37,798
has brought me to this moment.

00:31:37,865 --> 00:31:40,267
Blessings are when preparation
meets opportunity,

00:31:40,334 --> 00:31:42,236
and I stand before you
prepared.

00:31:42,302 --> 00:31:43,937
Thank you.

00:31:44,004 --> 00:31:45,239
Donny, how much
can the invis-a-rack hold?

00:31:45,305 --> 00:31:48,008
What's the weight-beared load
testing on it?

00:31:48,075 --> 00:31:50,077
We have put 1,500 pounds
statically on here.

00:31:50,143 --> 00:31:53,213
Still have not crushed it yet
'cause it was on my truck,

00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,148
so I didn't--I wasn't ready
to destroy my truck just yet.

00:31:55,215 --> 00:31:57,150
(chuckles) Your wife definitely
wouldn't go for that. Yeah.
Exactly.

00:31:57,217 --> 00:31:59,920
And will it fit
on any generic pickup truck?

00:31:59,987 --> 00:32:02,055
It will. We actually fit
on 36 million

00:32:02,122 --> 00:32:04,925
of the 40 million trucks
in 2-part numbers.

00:32:04,992 --> 00:32:06,793
Including the japanese ones?

00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,928
Even the japanese Ones.

00:32:07,995 --> 00:32:09,096
Where you building these?

00:32:09,162 --> 00:32:10,831
They come from different parts
around the country--

00:32:10,898 --> 00:32:13,934
ohio, wisconsin, and we bring it
all back to my--my hometown

00:32:14,001 --> 00:32:15,135
in sparta, north Carolina.

00:32:15,202 --> 00:32:16,803
Is your hope to employ
more people in your hometown?

00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:18,839
I hope to--I hope to employ
hundreds of people.

00:32:18,906 --> 00:32:20,974
It seemed to me when you were
talking about the hometown

00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:22,876
that that was very important
to you.

00:32:22,943 --> 00:32:24,778
It is, extremely.
What's going on there?
Is something bad happening?

00:32:24,845 --> 00:32:25,946
Well, we're just in

00:32:26,013 --> 00:32:27,915
an economically depressed region
of north Carolina,

00:32:27,981 --> 00:32:29,783
especially--and we--
we've had some--

00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,051
We've had textiles
over the years

00:32:31,118 --> 00:32:32,920
that have now gone away.

00:32:32,986 --> 00:32:36,790
We've had, uh, um, an aggregate
company that has gone away.

00:32:36,857 --> 00:32:40,827
And so we're kind of--
We're kind of stuck there.

00:32:40,894 --> 00:32:42,162
Donny, have you had any sales?

00:32:42,229 --> 00:32:44,865
We've got $50,000 in sales
in this first year since--

00:32:44,932 --> 00:32:46,900
$50,000?
$50,000 since January.

00:32:46,967 --> 00:32:48,001
And that's how many units?

00:32:48,068 --> 00:32:50,103
It's, uh, approximately
150 Units.

00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:52,940
Donny, you fall into the market
of enhancing...
mm-hmm.

00:32:53,006 --> 00:32:55,809
A truck--a secondary purchase
somebody has to make.

00:32:55,876 --> 00:32:57,144
There's a huge
distribution system

00:32:57,211 --> 00:32:59,913
that provides for that
here in America.
Mm-hmm.

00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,149
Why aren't you selling
to a distributor?

00:33:02,216 --> 00:33:04,818
Because they want
too many points right now.

00:33:04,885 --> 00:33:06,920
It's not something
where we can provide--
Well, hold on there right--

00:33:06,987 --> 00:33:08,021
well, the--the first question
should be,

00:33:08,088 --> 00:33:09,223
what's it cost to make?

00:33:09,289 --> 00:33:11,191
About $250 inside the Box.

00:33:11,258 --> 00:33:12,926
Okay.
(speaks indistinctly)

00:33:12,993 --> 00:33:15,262
So, Donny, the distributors want
to pay you how much today?

00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:17,264
What's--what's the price
they wanna buy it at?

00:33:17,331 --> 00:33:20,167
They think it has to be
somewhere it the low $300s.

00:33:20,234 --> 00:33:22,269
And you're making it
for $250 today?

00:33:22,336 --> 00:33:25,172
Right.
And at what volume
do you have to get to

00:33:25,239 --> 00:33:28,141
in order to get it to $150?

00:33:28,208 --> 00:33:29,810
If you can get it to $150.

00:33:29,877 --> 00:33:32,212
I don't know that we could
get to $150 in the U.S.

00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:35,249
Um...
okay, hold on there, Donny,
for a second.

00:33:35,315 --> 00:33:38,051
You've said before
that you wouldn't consider...

00:33:38,118 --> 00:33:39,219
I'm not gonna consider.

00:33:39,286 --> 00:33:40,888
I'm just saying
that we wouldn't be able to.

00:33:40,954 --> 00:33:42,789
But Let's just--Let's just
test that for a moment.

00:33:42,856 --> 00:33:43,957
Okay.

00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:45,893
Let's just say for a sec
that a manufacturer in Asia

00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:48,962
could make it for $150
in quantities of...

00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:50,964
let's say 1,000.

00:33:51,031 --> 00:33:52,099
Mm-hmm.
All right?

00:33:52,165 --> 00:33:53,100
That puts you in business
right now, my friend.

00:33:53,166 --> 00:33:54,768
You'd be in business
with the distributor

00:33:54,835 --> 00:33:56,803
that you're not doing
any business with right now.

00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:59,106
And yet you're saying no
to that. Why?

00:33:59,173 --> 00:34:00,874
(inhales deeply)

00:34:00,941 --> 00:34:02,876
because it's not a product
that needs a distributor.

00:34:02,943 --> 00:34:05,846
We can sell direct
to the retailer,

00:34:05,913 --> 00:34:09,116
of which there are about 10,000
that we could get to.

00:34:09,183 --> 00:34:10,250
But how do we get to them?

00:34:10,317 --> 00:34:12,219
For $100,000
that you're asking for today,

00:34:12,286 --> 00:34:14,054
what would you use
the $100,000 for?

00:34:14,121 --> 00:34:17,958
The $100,000 I would use right
now would be to create displays,

00:34:18,025 --> 00:34:21,261
to create a display where
it has this model on a, uh,

00:34:21,328 --> 00:34:24,898
on a system that is clamped
to it and have, you know,

00:34:24,965 --> 00:34:27,968
the, uh, a-a billboard
or, I mean, a placard behind it.

00:34:28,035 --> 00:34:29,203
We call those P.O.P.S.

00:34:29,269 --> 00:34:30,904
The P.O.P., right now.
Point of purchase.

00:34:30,971 --> 00:34:31,972
Right.

00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:34,808
And but you don't have
any orders.

00:34:34,875 --> 00:34:37,978
I have plenty that want
product free...
for free.

00:34:38,045 --> 00:34:40,113
So that they can... right.

00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,249
(speaks indistinctly)
So you are gonna not only go
into the manufacturing business

00:34:42,316 --> 00:34:44,084
but you're gonna go into
the financing business

00:34:44,151 --> 00:34:46,920
at this point, because that
means that you're gonna,

00:34:46,987 --> 00:34:48,188
as we say in the business,
hold the paper.

00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:49,790
Mm-hmm.

00:34:49,857 --> 00:34:51,091
You're gonna send it
to the retailer

00:34:51,158 --> 00:34:53,260
and hopefully
They'll pay you.

00:34:53,327 --> 00:34:56,864
But basically, you're making it
and you're selling it.

00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:57,998
Well, that's not what
I'm saying,

00:34:58,065 --> 00:34:59,867
is right now,
I'm not consigning anything.

00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:01,068
I'm not--
you're not because
you don't have any orders.

00:35:01,134 --> 00:35:02,769
R--

00:35:02,836 --> 00:35:04,972
(daymond) With $50,000 in sales,
what was the profit?

00:35:05,038 --> 00:35:06,139
Nothing.

00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,812
Well,
because it's a start-up.

00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:13,780
How much debt do you have?
How much debt?

00:35:13,847 --> 00:35:15,916
There's about $75,000
on, uh...

00:35:15,983 --> 00:35:17,150
at $50,000 in sales,

00:35:17,217 --> 00:35:21,054
where your price point isn't
even the accurate price point...

00:35:21,121 --> 00:35:22,189
you don't wanna
go overseas...

00:35:22,256 --> 00:35:24,157
well, it is an accurate
price point. It is...

00:35:24,224 --> 00:35:25,826
you don't wanna go overseas to
bring it down to a price point

00:35:25,893 --> 00:35:27,794
where it <i>can </i>happen.

00:35:27,861 --> 00:35:30,197
I don't believe the--I don't
believe the quality can stay.

00:35:30,264 --> 00:35:33,100
So if you can find
a quality manufacturer...
No.

00:35:33,166 --> 00:35:34,935
Can we take we take it
overseas?
No, sir.

00:35:35,002 --> 00:35:36,203
Why not?

00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:38,105
I just--it's not--not what
I'm going to do with my company.

00:35:38,172 --> 00:35:39,806
Why?
(Kevin) Right now--Donny--

00:35:39,873 --> 00:35:41,175
because I believe in what I--
I believe in what I am.

00:35:41,241 --> 00:35:42,910
I believe in what I'm doing
right now,

00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:47,247
and so if I can help
in any way, I will.

00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:50,017
But that's not a way
that I believe I wanna help.

00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:53,020
If you don't ever get to
make it yourself as a company,

00:35:53,086 --> 00:35:54,121
who can you help?

00:35:54,188 --> 00:35:57,124
(inhales and exhales deeply)

00:35:57,191 --> 00:36:00,027
I believe I can make it.
I know I can.

00:36:00,093 --> 00:36:01,795
Donny...
yes, sir?

00:36:01,862 --> 00:36:04,865
You can't solve the problem
We're talking about here.

00:36:04,932 --> 00:36:06,099
One man can't do it.

00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:09,069
I'm talking about the problem
of getting it done offshore.

00:36:09,136 --> 00:36:10,938
There's a reason
that's happening.

00:36:11,004 --> 00:36:13,073
And there's a reason that a lot
of the furniture Manufacturers

00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,842
are coming back.

00:36:14,908 --> 00:36:18,111
Yeah, but, you know, to say
that the quality is bad

00:36:18,178 --> 00:36:20,214
everywhere Offshore
is wrong.

00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,149
Of--of course.
And so...

00:36:22,216 --> 00:36:24,117
I-I'm kind of stuck here.

00:36:24,184 --> 00:36:25,953
I mean, if you had
a successful business

00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:28,856
and were manufacturing offshore,
you'd be employing somebody.

00:36:28,922 --> 00:36:31,258
Mm-hmm.
And as you grew,
you'd be employing more people.

00:36:31,325 --> 00:36:34,094
Then you'd bring it here
and employ more people...
(Robert) Donny...

00:36:34,161 --> 00:36:35,863
then you'd start more businesses
and employ more people.

00:36:35,929 --> 00:36:37,030
If you were successful, you
would need people to do sales,

00:36:37,097 --> 00:36:38,832
you need people
to do marketing.

00:36:38,899 --> 00:36:41,869
You've gotta do the right thing
for the business,

00:36:41,935 --> 00:36:43,937
number one.
Mm-hmm.

00:36:44,004 --> 00:36:45,205
And then everything else.

00:36:45,272 --> 00:36:47,908
If the business is healthy,
everything follows through.

00:36:47,975 --> 00:36:49,810
I understand that, for sure.

00:36:49,877 --> 00:36:52,880
Donny, you feel particularly
resistant and closed-minded,

00:36:52,946 --> 00:36:55,148
and that's a very bad partner
to be in business with,

00:36:55,215 --> 00:36:56,950
all right?

00:36:57,017 --> 00:36:58,952
And for that reason alone,
I'm out.

00:36:59,019 --> 00:37:00,888
Okay.

00:37:00,954 --> 00:37:02,990
Now we're right in
the meat of the number

00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:04,925
for racks that are
on the market.

00:37:04,992 --> 00:37:07,094
I mean, we're not too expensive,
we're not too inexpensive.

00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,830
No orders, my friend.
I understand.

00:37:09,897 --> 00:37:11,131
But you've made it impossible
for an investor to get a return.

00:37:11,198 --> 00:37:13,166
Doesn't matter
where it's made.

00:37:13,233 --> 00:37:14,801
Apple computer--

00:37:14,868 --> 00:37:17,171
second largest company on earth
after exxon--

00:37:17,237 --> 00:37:20,107
employs 49,000 people
here in America.

00:37:20,174 --> 00:37:23,076
But it knows it has to
make its products offshore

00:37:23,143 --> 00:37:25,879
to be competitive and make
a profit for shareholders.

00:37:25,946 --> 00:37:27,848
Just like you do, Donny.
Mm-hmm.

00:37:27,915 --> 00:37:28,949
And I don't hear that,
all right?

00:37:29,016 --> 00:37:30,918
So for me, as an investor,

00:37:30,984 --> 00:37:32,119
I'm not interested

00:37:32,186 --> 00:37:34,788
because you don't want
to do what it takes.

00:37:34,855 --> 00:37:37,891
That's the problem.
I'm out.

00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:40,160
(mouths word)

00:37:40,227 --> 00:37:41,962
Well, I do believe
that it has the potential.

00:37:42,029 --> 00:37:45,799
There are plenty of companies
within the automotive market

00:37:45,866 --> 00:37:47,167
that are building
in the United States

00:37:47,234 --> 00:37:49,837
and part of what I saw
at S.E.M.A.

00:37:49,903 --> 00:37:53,841
Was a company that had taken
their product to an asian market

00:37:53,907 --> 00:37:58,111
to have it constructed,
and now they are losing share

00:37:58,178 --> 00:38:00,914
because that asian market
has now created that product

00:38:00,981 --> 00:38:03,050
and has set up a Booth
right beside them at s.E.M.A.

00:38:03,116 --> 00:38:05,052
And--and being able
to sell that product

00:38:05,118 --> 00:38:07,921
right from Under them without
any integrity whatsoever that--

00:38:07,988 --> 00:38:10,257
yeah, but, Donny, integrity's
not American or Offshore.

00:38:10,324 --> 00:38:12,893
Integrity's integrity based on
the human being.

00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,262
I mean, that's really not fair
to say about--to say that.

00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:17,798
You could get screwed
the same way in America

00:38:17,865 --> 00:38:20,133
as you could offshore.
I have no doubt about that
whatsoever, for sure.

00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,269
Donny, you know, I believe that
there's three courses and phases

00:38:22,336 --> 00:38:23,871
you go through in life,

00:38:23,937 --> 00:38:25,939
and I went through
the same phase.

00:38:26,006 --> 00:38:28,008
First, I had to make it,

00:38:28,075 --> 00:38:29,209
then I had to master it,

00:38:29,276 --> 00:38:31,011
and now I can matter.

00:38:31,078 --> 00:38:33,981
And I think you're trying to do
all of it at the same time.

00:38:34,047 --> 00:38:35,115
Okay.

00:38:35,182 --> 00:38:37,818
And I don't think
that you're doing it...

00:38:37,885 --> 00:38:39,119
successfully,

00:38:39,186 --> 00:38:42,055
so I would have to
regretfully say that I'm out.

00:38:42,122 --> 00:38:44,191
Okay.

00:38:45,893 --> 00:38:47,127
That's three sharks out.

00:38:47,194 --> 00:38:48,228
There's only mark and Robert
left.

00:38:48,295 --> 00:38:50,197
Right.

00:38:50,264 --> 00:38:52,065
Start focusing on them.
Okay.

00:38:55,068 --> 00:38:56,803
A factory worker's son.

00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,071
Oh, I know. I hear ya.

00:38:58,138 --> 00:39:00,140
I hear ya. You're hitting
a chord with me.

00:39:02,042 --> 00:39:03,043
I mean...

00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,945
You know... (sighs)

00:39:05,012 --> 00:39:06,980
This is
the land of opportunity.

00:39:07,047 --> 00:39:10,050
This is--look, America's
the land of opportunity.

00:39:10,117 --> 00:39:11,251
It welcomes all.

00:39:11,318 --> 00:39:13,020
Mm-hmm.

00:39:13,086 --> 00:39:15,856
It's tough--it's tough
when people lose their jobs,

00:39:15,923 --> 00:39:18,225
but it's a global economy.

00:39:18,292 --> 00:39:23,230
I think americans can compete on
a world-class scale anywhere.

00:39:23,297 --> 00:39:24,898
Mm-hmm.

00:39:24,965 --> 00:39:25,999
So whether you make it here
or you make it there,

00:39:26,066 --> 00:39:27,901
you build a successful business.

00:39:27,968 --> 00:39:31,004
It's not about "Made in America"
Because We're all immigrants.

00:39:31,071 --> 00:39:34,107
We would've never had
the opportunity to come here

00:39:34,174 --> 00:39:36,009
if--if everybody thought
that way.

00:39:36,076 --> 00:39:38,078
And--and again, I'm...

00:39:38,145 --> 00:39:39,813
trying
not to be disrespectful...

00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,049
Sure.
Because my Dad was
a factory worker.

00:39:42,115 --> 00:39:44,184
You know, and he came here
to work in a factory

00:39:44,251 --> 00:39:45,219
and swept floors.

00:39:45,285 --> 00:39:46,954
Right.

00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:51,191
For a guy who was proud
from the country to...

00:39:51,258 --> 00:39:52,793
(voice breaking)
You know, I just remember

00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:56,897
my Dad came here
and worked in the factory...

00:39:59,032 --> 00:40:01,034
You know, people made fun of him

00:40:01,101 --> 00:40:03,070
because he wasn't american,

00:40:03,136 --> 00:40:05,138
and they called him
all kinds of names.

00:40:05,205 --> 00:40:08,909
And it--it--it hurt him <i>deeply.</i>

00:40:10,244 --> 00:40:13,113
You know, my dad passed away
last year, Donny...

00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,181
oh, I'm sorry
to hear that.

00:40:14,248 --> 00:40:17,117
(crying) And, uh, I just...

00:40:17,184 --> 00:40:20,053
I always asked him
what was he the most proud of,

00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:24,191
and the first factory job--

00:40:24,258 --> 00:40:27,060
not when he made some money,
not when he got promoted--

00:40:27,127 --> 00:40:31,798
that factory job
where he swept floors,

00:40:31,865 --> 00:40:33,267
you know, that made him proud.

00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:34,968
So I admire what you're doing,

00:40:35,035 --> 00:40:37,237
but I just can't get involved

00:40:37,304 --> 00:40:39,173
with--With something

00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:41,074
where you're not taking care
of the business.

00:40:41,141 --> 00:40:43,243
I-I'm sorry. I'm out.

<i>last chance to make a deal.</i>

00:40:58,792 --> 00:40:59,893
You know, Donny,

00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,029
there's--there's just
a couple elements here.

00:41:02,095 --> 00:41:04,898
One, I don't agree with
where they're coming from

00:41:04,965 --> 00:41:07,634
in terms of you have to squeeze
every dollar.

00:41:07,701 --> 00:41:09,036
There--there's always
a give and take.

00:41:09,102 --> 00:41:10,804
But what I--
what I see here is

00:41:10,871 --> 00:41:12,706
a very capital-intensive
business.

00:41:12,773 --> 00:41:15,008
Right? Just $100,000
give or take

00:41:15,075 --> 00:41:16,810
just for
the point of Purchase.

00:41:16,877 --> 00:41:17,811
Mm-hmm.

00:41:17,878 --> 00:41:20,848
Another $200,000
to $250,000 plus

00:41:20,914 --> 00:41:23,050
in order to be able to get
to another price point

00:41:23,116 --> 00:41:25,652
to be able to appease
your customers, right?

00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:26,887
Mm-hmm.
And that creates

00:41:26,954 --> 00:41:29,756
a very difficult return on
investment opportunity for me.

00:41:29,823 --> 00:41:31,792
Right.
I would love to be able
to say,

00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:32,960
you know what?
Let's just get behind Donny

00:41:33,026 --> 00:41:35,762
and Let's just make this
happen," right?
Mm-hmm.

00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:38,799
But there's no amount
of capital right now

00:41:38,866 --> 00:41:40,601
that's going to get us
to a point where, you know,

00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:42,603
it's obvious
that you're over the hump.

00:41:42,669 --> 00:41:43,737
Right?
Right.

00:41:43,804 --> 00:41:44,838
And so...

00:41:44,905 --> 00:41:46,740
un--unfortunately, I'm...

00:41:46,807 --> 00:41:48,141
I'm out.

00:41:49,877 --> 00:41:52,079
Okay.

00:41:52,145 --> 00:41:53,914
All right. Great.

00:41:55,015 --> 00:41:56,750
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you for your time.

Thank you for your time.
I appreciate it.

(Kevin) Thank you, Donny.
(Barbara) Thank you.

I appreciate it. Thank you.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.

00:42:05,959 --> 00:42:08,629
You know what? You know
what's special about this?

00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:10,764
Good old American ingenuity
is alive and well.

00:42:10,831 --> 00:42:12,699
The American dream
is alive and well.

00:42:12,766 --> 00:42:14,034
I don't disagree,

00:42:14,101 --> 00:42:16,637
but his primary point was,
"I'm gonna make it here."

00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,871
And Kevin brought up
a good point.

00:42:17,938 --> 00:42:20,874
"If you could make it cheaper
and build the business,

00:42:20,941 --> 00:42:22,976
would you do it?"
and he said, "no."

00:42:23,043 --> 00:42:24,711
I wanna take care of my own.

00:42:24,778 --> 00:42:27,981
I want people to--to have this
product and enjoy this product

00:42:28,048 --> 00:42:30,884
knowing that the hands
of the people in this country

00:42:30,951 --> 00:42:32,085
put it together.
