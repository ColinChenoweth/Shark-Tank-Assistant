00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:17,397
They've--they've told us
50 per store.

00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:20,033
How many stores do they have?
They have--
they have 5,000 stores.

00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,335
Who is it?

00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,004
Sam's.

00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:25,973
Wow.
(daymond) Sam's clubs.

00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,140
Wow.

00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:31,211
Let me ask you this.
Why do you need $125,000 today?

00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:34,114
We're building right now
at my plant in dothan, alabama.

00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,350
And by the way, this is
a 100% U.S.A.-Made Product.

00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,118
Congratulations for that.
That's important.

00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,386
Thank you.

00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:40,921
Why aren't you making it
in China?

00:08:40,988 --> 00:08:43,190
I want it to be U.S.A.

00:08:43,257 --> 00:08:45,392
I think that's the downfall
of our country.

00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:47,961
I bet you they can make that
for 80 cents.

00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,263
They probably can.

00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:51,198
Yeah, you can squeeze
another Nickel out...
it's not a Nickel.

00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:52,966
But it--but it's--a dollar.

00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,368
Sometimes it feels good to
do the right thing, so I'm--

00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:56,937
he comes from a territory's
that's been destroyed.

00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:58,172
I think the people need
the jobs.

00:08:58,238 --> 00:08:59,306
Good for you, Travis.
They are--yeah, they do.

00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,974
Good for you.

00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,209
All right, Travis,

00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:04,344
I think you have something
really interesting here, but...

00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:07,047
I don't like your valuation,
my friend.

00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:08,348
Sure.

00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:12,286
But I believe if it works,
it'll get its place in retail

00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:13,954
in places like
guitar center.

00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:16,023
I've lived with Guitars
my whole life.

00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:18,959
I got a lot of 'em.
I play guitar.

00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:22,396
So I'm gonna
make you an offer.

00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:25,165
I'll give you $125,000...

00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,401
for 20%,

00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:31,038
and I'll personally endorse
the product.

00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:32,940
I'll do an infomercial
for you.

00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:36,109
Put my face on the box--whatever
you wanna do for $12 million.

00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:38,045
Travis, that's how vain he is.
That's how self-important he is

00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:41,048
he thinks that his picture
on the box is gonna sell it.
Yeah, he does.

00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:42,182
(Robert laughs)
He does.

00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,251
Hey, he's big in L.A.--
Lower Alabama.

00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:46,186
(laughs)

00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:49,189
Hey, listen, I'm up here
for a reason, my friend.

00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:50,257
Don't make jokes about it.

00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:52,359
(daymond) Travis, sir...

00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:55,095
I think I'm gonna match
Voldemort's offer...

00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,266
but I think you'll know
that I'm a better partner

00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:03,403
so I'm gonna do
the same $125,000 for 20%.

00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,006
This guy cannot play guitar,
by the way.

00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:07,407
I think that's the Point.

00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:10,277
Yeah. Barbara,
are you in or you out?

00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:11,979
I'm thinking about it.

00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:14,414
Mark, all right you in
or you out?
I'm thinking.

00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:16,350
(daymond)
Are you in or you're out?

00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,252
(Robert) Thinking.
Oh, my gosh.

00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:19,386
Travis, you got two offers
on the table,

00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:22,222
and those offers
will soon be gone.

00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,224
So while everybody else
is thinking,

00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,393
would you like to make
a decision?

00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:32,399
♪♪♪

00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:40,174

and I'll personally endorse

00:10:53,554 --> 00:10:58,425
I'm gonna do the same.
$125,000, 20%.

00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,060
(Robert) same offer.
Same--same offer.

00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:02,129
(Kevin) same offer.
Endorsement?

00:11:02,196 --> 00:11:04,264
I happen to represent
a lot of the biggest celebrities

00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:05,465
in the world.

00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:08,302
(Kevin) But they're not gonna
get you that for free.

00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:09,403
We may work that in.

00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:12,105
You're gonna get
a free celebrity endorsement?

00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:14,107
Absolutely.

00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,342
Wow.

00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:16,510
I don't think so.

00:11:16,577 --> 00:11:18,312
Which celebrity, daymond?

00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:19,413
Don't worry about it.

00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:23,116
I do worry about it,
if that's swaying him.

00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,252
I wouldn't promise 'em
without speaking to 'em.

00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:28,055
I can do that, 'cause I
represent them, so that's--

00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:29,122
oh, you're
in the agent business?

00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,424
You know, the good news is,
I represent me,

00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,459
and I just spoke to myself,
and I'm okay with it.

00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:33,460
(laughs)

00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:34,461
(laughs)

00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,530
I'm vacillating, Travis.

00:11:36,597 --> 00:11:38,198
I mean, I like
what you're doing.
Okay.

00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:40,167
I love the fact that
you're made in the U.S.A.,

00:11:40,234 --> 00:11:44,037
but I'm not quite sure that
you're gonna be able to scale--

00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:45,072
you're gonna have
to be that guy

00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:47,107
that goes on the road show
all the time,

00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:48,308
and how old are
your kids now?

00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,077
10, 3, and 1.

00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,178
That's part of the problem,
right?

00:11:51,245 --> 00:11:52,412
That's tough,

00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:56,183
so... I'm out.

00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,253
I have an offer for you.

00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:00,354
Okay.

00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,322
I'm going
to beat this jerk's offer.

00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:03,457
You don't want to go
with him.

00:12:03,524 --> 00:12:05,125
(laughs)

00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:07,160
Oh, you know, what a witch.
I'm gonna give you--

00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:12,165
I'm going to give you $175,000
for the same 20%...

00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:18,172
with the contingency that
$50,000 of that money

00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,473
is used
to make an infomercial,

00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,476
and you know why?

00:12:22,543 --> 00:12:24,344
Because the best thing
you have going about you

00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,246
is not just your product
but you,

00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:28,282
and that's
the only missing piece here.

00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:30,117
You've got to figure a way
to take you

00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:32,052
and multiply it times 1,000,

00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:34,421
and there's no better medium
than television.

00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:38,392
I would not guarantee you're
gonna be in an infomercial

00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,294
until you've rolled out
retail.

00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,029
Travis, you--
don't let an investor tell you
how to run your business.

00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,398
No, I have--
Travis, infomercials is
just another way

00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:46,066
to sell the product.

00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:47,201
Another way?
That might be part
of the future.

00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,436
It puts him in--it puts him
in every living room.

00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:52,306
Oh, please.
Travis, here's an offer.

00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:53,373
I'm just a redneck
from croatia,

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,043
like you're a redneck
from alabama.

00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:59,112
I'll give you the $125,000

00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:01,215
for... 20%.

00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,249
Same offer.

00:13:02,316 --> 00:13:04,117
I don't think you need
more cash.

00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:06,086
I don't think you need to do
the infomercial right now.

00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:07,154
Oh, really? You want
to keep him locked up.

00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:09,089
I'll give you
the $125,000 for 20%.

00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:11,325
I'm the only one here

00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:14,194
who wants to be a rock star
and can't play,

00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:18,432
so I'm living up to a promise
I made to <i>my </i>daughter.

00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,071
(Kevin) Let's summarize
what we've got, okay?

00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,507
We've got
croatian rock star wannabe guy--

00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:28,041
$125,000 for 20%.
(Barbara laughs)

00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:30,043
but am I not the market?

00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,111
And--what?

00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:32,346
(Travis) You are the market.
$125,000 for 20%.

00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:34,047
We've got

00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:35,349
"I want to control your life
in every way known to man"--

00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:37,217
Barbara.
Not at all.

00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:40,020
He's the lead.
I just want to help him.

00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:42,356
Um, I'm just pointing out
what you <i>do </i>want, and that's--

00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:46,126
$175,000 gets you 20%
with her deal,

00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:48,195
but a nightmare from hell
to work with.

00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:49,263
We know that.

00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,264
Really?
I'm a straight shooter here.

00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,431
I just want to give you
some money.

00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:54,301
I love guitar,
and if you <i>want </i>my endorsement,

00:13:54,368 --> 00:13:55,402
you get it for free,

00:13:55,469 --> 00:13:59,273
and daymond has
some nebulous guy in the sky--

00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,176
we don't know who it is--
that <i>maybe </i>will endorse this,

00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:06,146
but he'll do a--the same deal,
$125,000 for 20%.

00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:09,049
You're in a really rare spot
right now, Travis.

00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:11,218
Not often in the shark tank
do you get

00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:14,121
four rock-solid Offers.

00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:18,492
Travis...
those are pr-pretty good offers.
In fact--

00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:20,093
this is a no-brainer.

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,396
I've offered you $50,000 more

00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:25,199
to get you to where
you need to go,

00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:30,103
to get your personality on tv.

00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,438
People are gonna fall
in love with You.
Look, I can get you on tv

00:14:31,505 --> 00:14:33,240
in two seconds. It's Nothing.
Look at the offers
you're getting.

00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:35,042
It's your personality that
they're falling in love with.

00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:36,410
Look, I'm just
a lonely shark here

00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:38,378
trying to play the guitar,
baby.

00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:39,379
This is so hard.

00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:43,250
(strums notes)

00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:45,485
Robert, would you...

00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:48,422
sweeten your offer some way?

00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:54,094
I'll put the $50,000 aside
to produce an infomercial,

00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:55,495
if we make that decision.

00:14:57,364 --> 00:14:58,498
So it's $125,000 cash

00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:01,401
with $50,000 in escrow
for an infomercial?

00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:03,403
Absolutely.

00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:06,373
'cause I'm gonna quit
this shark thing, baby.

00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,374
I'm gonna go on the road.

00:15:07,441 --> 00:15:08,375
Me and you. Me and you.

00:15:08,442 --> 00:15:10,143
I'm gonna become a rock star.

00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,446
I'm talking about a duo
in the redneck riviera.

00:15:12,513 --> 00:15:14,481
Me, too, Baby.
(mark and Barbara laugh)

00:15:14,548 --> 00:15:17,351
do we have a deal?
Do we have a deal?

00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,219
Travis.

00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:21,054
Robert, the deal's with you.

00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:23,457
Damn. Ohh.

00:15:23,524 --> 00:15:24,458
Whoo!
(laughs)

00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:25,459
Oh, baby, I'm gonna be--

00:15:25,526 --> 00:15:26,460
(both) Yeah!

00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:31,538
So in the retail space,
I have--

00:19:31,605 --> 00:19:33,440
which is one of my challenges
right now, Kevin--

00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:35,342
oh, you're not getting
into retail, Pat.

00:19:35,409 --> 00:19:37,578
I'm not--I'm not--
I-I've got--

00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:39,713
right. I've got it
in very limited Retail.

00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,348
Isn't the truth about
this business,

00:19:41,415 --> 00:19:42,749
the--one of the highest margin
businesses on earth,

00:19:42,816 --> 00:19:45,719
but large box retailers,
where 90% of this is sold,

00:19:45,786 --> 00:19:48,288
would never give you
any space

00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:50,490
'cause they protect it like
drug dealers protect their turf?

00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:51,692
No. No, they will give him
the space,

00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:53,594
but they'll give him the space
at $1.5 million...

00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,330
exactly.
Because the JUICE only costs
a dollar to make

00:19:56,396 --> 00:19:57,598
and $50 to sell.
That's my Point.

00:19:57,664 --> 00:19:58,665
He's never gonna get
any distribution.

00:19:58,732 --> 00:20:02,402
But I am talking to C.V.S.
Right now.

00:20:02,469 --> 00:20:03,670
They are very interested.

00:20:03,737 --> 00:20:05,706
How much have you invested
in this company?

00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:09,309
So I've put about $50,000
into this product.

00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:10,477
(Robert) I don't think
that's very much.

00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:12,312
How'd you--how'd you
come up with this?

00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,648
So I went to an a.T.M.

00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:17,618
The bills were so new that
they actually stuck together.

00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:19,620
They were--there was
a unique fragrance to them.

00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:21,722
I didn't realize money really
had its OWN unique smell.

00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:24,358
It definitely does.
You don't have enough of it.
That's the problem.

00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:25,459
(laughs)

00:20:25,526 --> 00:20:27,661
and then I read this study,
uh, about japan,

00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:29,630
where they actually pump
that fragrance

00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:31,431
through the vents...
really?

00:20:31,498 --> 00:20:32,566
To increase
worker productivity.

00:20:32,633 --> 00:20:33,567

00:20:33,634 --> 00:20:34,701

ambient scenting.

00:20:34,768 --> 00:20:35,702
It's actually about
$100 million a year market

00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:37,304
and growing.

00:20:37,371 --> 00:20:38,705
Well, you've done research
on that market.

00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:41,275
That sounds like a far different
and more enticing market...
Mm. Definitely.

00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:42,442
Than selling perfume.

00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:46,713
Have you looked at piping in
the scent of your money

00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,549
in--in
an ambient environment?

00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:51,385
I-I haven't, but I have been
approached by banks

00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:52,586
to use it as a gift.

00:20:52,653 --> 00:20:53,754
When you open an account
with the bank,

00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,755
they actually will
give you--

00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:56,423
give you your money back?
(laughs)

00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,558
Will give you money back.
That's exactly right.

00:20:57,624 --> 00:20:58,625
Pat, that's all good,

00:20:58,692 --> 00:21:00,460
but there's a little bit
of a problem here.

00:21:00,527 --> 00:21:03,497
You gotta get huge distribution.
You gotta buy your way in.

00:21:03,564 --> 00:21:04,665
This is what daymond was
talking about.

00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:07,568
You need millions of dollars,
so...

00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:11,738
so I put out one press release
on this product.

00:21:11,805 --> 00:21:15,409
This product exploded
worldwide.

00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:17,444
It's in Poland, croatia,
China--

00:21:17,511 --> 00:21:18,478
$50,000 in Sales.

00:21:18,545 --> 00:21:20,614
$50,000 in sales is not
an explosion.

00:21:20,681 --> 00:21:21,648
It is in Croatia.

00:21:21,715 --> 00:21:22,749
Uh, it's an implosion.

00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,551
But it's
a very unique product, right?

00:21:24,618 --> 00:21:26,553
The--you buy this product
because of the name,

00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,455
and you come back
because of the fragrance.

00:21:28,522 --> 00:21:31,358
(daymond) This business
is solely on advertising,

00:21:31,425 --> 00:21:33,393
and $100,000
will only buy you

00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,496
<i>one </i>page in <i>one </i>of the books
that the big guys are in.

00:21:36,563 --> 00:21:39,600
Pat, how much money do you have
left to put in this business?

00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:40,767
Frankly I don't--

00:21:40,834 --> 00:21:42,469
I really don't want to put
any more money into it.

00:21:42,536 --> 00:21:44,371
So this is
your big play here.

00:21:44,438 --> 00:21:47,341
You gotta walk out of the tank
with the cash in your pocket.
Absolutely.

00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:48,475
Correct. This is it.

00:21:48,542 --> 00:21:49,710
(daymond)
So why would you offer us...
This--

00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:51,712
5%...
right.

00:21:51,778 --> 00:21:53,614
For $100,000?

00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,715
That means you are saying

00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:57,718
the value of your company
is $2 million.

00:21:57,784 --> 00:22:00,287
Well, I'm gonna go back
to my Point.

00:22:00,354 --> 00:22:01,622
You're talking
about a $32 billion Market.

00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:03,657
Seven out of ten are
for gifts.

00:22:03,724 --> 00:22:05,759
Pat, you've broke--you've broken
the Cardinal rule for me.

00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:07,461
Yeah.

00:22:07,528 --> 00:22:09,696
When someone starts off with,
"the market is billions,

00:22:09,763 --> 00:22:12,466
and if I only get
a small percentage..."
Yeah.

00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:13,567
I'll be okay."

00:22:13,634 --> 00:22:15,369
That's always a red flag...
right. Right.

00:22:15,435 --> 00:22:16,603

00:22:18,605 --> 00:22:19,706
Now that's not fair, Mark.

00:22:19,773 --> 00:22:21,675
That's not fair.
What? I don't care.

00:22:21,742 --> 00:22:23,443
If y-you want my money,
and you want

00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,645
a $2 million valuation...
right. Right.

00:22:24,711 --> 00:22:27,648
And if you don't believe
enough to sell money,

00:22:27,714 --> 00:22:29,716
then you're a <i>want-repreneur, </i>
not an entrepreneur,

00:22:29,783 --> 00:22:31,618
and for that reason,
I'm out.

00:22:33,587 --> 00:22:36,423
Now you said,
money can't buy you happiness.

00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,424
I've been rich,
and I've been poor.

00:22:37,491 --> 00:22:38,425
Right.

00:22:38,492 --> 00:22:39,426
Rich is better.

00:22:39,493 --> 00:22:40,527
I agree.

00:22:40,594 --> 00:22:42,396
By the way,
is this real money?

00:22:42,462 --> 00:22:43,397
That is real money.

00:22:43,463 --> 00:22:44,598
What?
It is?

00:22:44,665 --> 00:22:45,666
Aren't you going to jail
for chopping up money, Pat?

00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:47,301
Wow. That's not right.
(chuckles) Yeah.

00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:48,569
Yeah, that's actual
shredded U.S. Currency.

00:22:48,635 --> 00:22:49,670
Where'd you get it from?

00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:51,605
I buy that from
the department of Treasury.

00:22:51,672 --> 00:22:53,407
Well, that's cool.

00:22:53,473 --> 00:22:55,542
Is there a business in taping
this back together again?

00:22:55,609 --> 00:22:56,610
(sharks laugh)
(chuckles) No, there isn't.

00:22:56,677 --> 00:22:57,711
I don't know.

00:22:57,778 --> 00:22:59,413
No, that would be illegal.
We can't do that.

00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:01,448
Look, Pat, the only thing
of value I see is that you--

00:23:01,515 --> 00:23:03,317
you've got the name "Money"
in the fragrance Category.

00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:05,719
Good for you.
Everything else is insane.

00:23:05,786 --> 00:23:08,355
I love money.

00:23:08,422 --> 00:23:11,325
I'm emotionally involved
with it, and it loves me, too,

00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:14,561
so it really breaks my heart
to have to say this to you,

00:23:14,628 --> 00:23:16,730
but I'm out.

00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:26,607
I know that 75% of all
fragrances are sold duty-free,

00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:29,710
and the rest,
you need backing.

00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:33,413
I like
that idea of the license...

00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:35,749
so...

00:23:35,816 --> 00:23:39,486
I'll give you
the $100,000 for 80%...

00:23:40,687 --> 00:23:42,656
and I'll go license the name,

00:23:42,723 --> 00:23:45,592
and we'll make a lot
of <i>real </i>money.

00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:47,694
I-I think 80% is--
is quite high.

00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:49,730
(mark) Just remember,

00:23:49,796 --> 00:23:52,599
100% of Nothing is
still Nothing.

00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:55,569
20% of something growing
and big...

00:23:55,636 --> 00:23:58,438
he's offering to put himself
to work for you

00:23:58,505 --> 00:23:59,506
and pay you to do it.

00:23:59,573 --> 00:24:01,642
That never happens.

00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:05,479
Pat, I must say, I think
your packaging is Great.

00:24:05,546 --> 00:24:06,613
Thank you.
Perfect, okay?

00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,448
But that doesn't smell
like money to me.

00:24:08,515 --> 00:24:09,550
You know what?

00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:11,552
I get $500 a week out
of that cash machine,

00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:13,520
'cause they always
give it to me in New $50s...
right. Right.

00:24:13,587 --> 00:24:14,655
So I purposely do it.
Yes.

00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:15,756
I always smell the money
before I put it

00:24:15,822 --> 00:24:17,324
in my wallet...
right.

00:24:17,391 --> 00:24:18,559
So I really know
what money smells like.

00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:21,295
It's subtle.
This is not subtle.

00:24:21,361 --> 00:24:22,396
Even though you look
like Robert Redford...

00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:23,397
(laughs)

00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:25,766
I'm out.

00:24:25,832 --> 00:24:27,734
(daymond) you have an offer
on the table.

00:24:30,604 --> 00:24:32,372
(sighs)

00:24:32,439 --> 00:24:34,308
80% of the company?

00:24:34,374 --> 00:24:35,409
Yes.

00:24:36,844 --> 00:24:40,347
I mean, I really would like
to have control of this company.

00:24:40,414 --> 00:24:45,619
Pat, it disturbs me a little bit
that we had to show you

00:24:45,686 --> 00:24:48,488
the obvious path,
which was licensing.

00:24:48,555 --> 00:24:50,457
I don't think this is
a perfume product.

00:24:50,524 --> 00:24:52,426
I think this is
a licensing product.

00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:53,694
I don't smell the money.

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,331
I smell failure with
the strategy you have today,

00:24:57,397 --> 00:24:58,498
and for that, I'm out.

00:25:03,704 --> 00:25:06,740
Just like money, when there's
not enough buyers,

00:25:06,807 --> 00:25:08,609
my money becomes more valuable,

00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:10,377
and just like real money,

00:25:10,444 --> 00:25:12,779
you have a depreciating asset
right now.
Right. Right.

00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:14,548
So unless you give me
an answer right now,

00:25:14,615 --> 00:25:16,316
it's going up to 85%.

00:25:16,383 --> 00:25:18,552
(chuckles) 80%?

00:25:23,724 --> 00:25:24,691
So, again, I think that

00:25:24,758 --> 00:25:26,527
this market has
tremendous potential.

00:25:26,593 --> 00:25:28,395
80% is too much.

00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,565
I can't do 80%.

00:25:31,632 --> 00:25:33,433
Then I'm out.

00:25:38,772 --> 00:25:40,440
There goes the money.

00:25:40,507 --> 00:25:41,708
(laughs)

00:25:41,775 --> 00:25:45,345
(Pat) I have no regrets,
turning down Daymond's offer.

00:25:45,412 --> 00:25:48,315
The 80% was just out of Line.

no one will want to be caught

00:27:09,463 --> 00:27:11,465
Tail Lightz are
attachable lighted designs

00:27:11,532 --> 00:27:12,566
for Jean pockets.

00:27:12,633 --> 00:27:15,502
Anyone can easily attach
or detach tail lightz

00:27:15,569 --> 00:27:18,372
to the back pocket
of any jeans, shorts,

00:27:18,438 --> 00:27:23,544
or, Heck, even your hat,
purse, or backpack.

00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:25,179
There are
tiny, strong magnets

00:27:25,245 --> 00:27:27,147
on the back
of each lighted design,

00:27:27,214 --> 00:27:29,449
which hold it in place
no matter what you put it on.

00:27:29,516 --> 00:27:32,519
We can tailor our designs
towards all age groups.

00:27:32,586 --> 00:27:36,223
Designs like the Smiley face
and sports themes

00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,125
will appeal towards
young kids,

00:27:38,192 --> 00:27:39,526
and our fun phrase designs,

00:27:39,593 --> 00:27:44,498
like "Sassy britches,"
"Rock star," and "Drama Queen,"

00:27:44,565 --> 00:27:47,601
will Appeal towards
girls and women of all ages.

00:27:47,668 --> 00:27:50,571
The possibilities are
endless.

00:27:52,306 --> 00:27:54,241
My Products are currently
in the design phase

00:27:54,308 --> 00:27:55,576
with working prototypes.

00:27:55,642 --> 00:27:58,378
With your partnership,
I will be able to design

00:27:58,445 --> 00:28:00,447
slimmer Retail-ready products
and packaging...
thank you.

00:28:00,514 --> 00:28:02,516
So that tail lightz will
soon be lighting up

00:28:02,583 --> 00:28:04,618
every Retail store
across the country.

00:28:04,685 --> 00:28:08,222
So who is ready to partner
with an experienced inventor

00:28:08,288 --> 00:28:09,590
and light things up?

00:28:09,656 --> 00:28:11,325
Who's ready?
I'm ready.

00:28:11,391 --> 00:28:12,526
That's it? You're in?
That's it?

00:28:12,593 --> 00:28:14,161
All right. Let's go.

00:28:14,228 --> 00:28:15,495
I am ready to go out.

00:28:15,562 --> 00:28:16,597
(Robert) Oh. (laughs)

00:28:16,663 --> 00:28:17,598
(laughs)

00:28:17,664 --> 00:28:21,201
I'm out.

00:28:21,268 --> 00:28:22,369
So, Barbara,
you're really out?

00:28:22,436 --> 00:28:24,605
Yes. Would you like
to know why?
Do you want to--

00:28:24,671 --> 00:28:26,106
do you want to make
a speech about why? Sure.

00:28:26,173 --> 00:28:27,608
I wouldn't mind. Yeah.
Sure.

00:28:27,674 --> 00:28:30,344
First off, sitting on this
would be painful...

00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:32,212
yep.
On the back seat
of your pants.

00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:34,248
Secondly, I bet
they don't wash well

00:28:34,314 --> 00:28:36,550
when you make the mistake
of forgetting to take them off.

00:28:36,617 --> 00:28:41,188
Third, I think the designs
on these feel dated to me.

00:28:41,255 --> 00:28:43,123
But other than that,
I love the idea.

00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:46,159
(Robert and mark laugh)

00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:48,395
guys, what do you have
on your tush?

00:28:48,462 --> 00:28:49,396
Sassy Britches.

00:28:49,463 --> 00:28:50,531
Sassy britches.

00:28:50,597 --> 00:28:53,200
Would you go on a date
wearing "Sassy Britches"?

00:28:53,267 --> 00:28:55,202
um...

00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:57,137
you see, that's
the problem, right?

00:28:57,204 --> 00:28:59,106
You've got your core audience
right here,

00:28:59,173 --> 00:29:00,207
but do you think
it's going to catch on

00:29:00,274 --> 00:29:03,310
and catch fire
and lighten all of America?

00:29:03,377 --> 00:29:04,444
I just don't see it.

00:29:04,511 --> 00:29:06,547
Well, keep in mind that
these prototypes are bulky.

00:29:06,613 --> 00:29:09,249
I realize that, and that's
why I'm here today.

00:29:09,316 --> 00:29:11,185
I need the funding to get
to that next level.

00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:12,219
There's other products

00:29:12,286 --> 00:29:14,421
like this out there.
They do make--

00:29:14,488 --> 00:29:16,423
I have not seen
any other products

00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,591
that combine the lighting
and the design.

00:29:17,658 --> 00:29:19,526
You've never seen
a button that glows?

00:29:19,593 --> 00:29:22,429
Not in a-a Patch,
with the lighting like this,

00:29:22,496 --> 00:29:24,198
that are detachable
and can be removed and--

00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:25,465
but there's nothing proprietary
about it, right?

00:29:25,532 --> 00:29:28,202
If I wanted to knock it off,
why couldn't I just go

00:29:28,268 --> 00:29:30,470
and get this manufactured
and compete with you?

00:29:30,537 --> 00:29:33,173
Because there's nothing
to stop me from doing it.

00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,576
Well, I have
two patents pending.

00:29:35,642 --> 00:29:37,377
And what are
your patents for?

00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:40,347
The patents are for
the detachable lighted design,

00:29:40,414 --> 00:29:43,150
and then the other patent is
for the fashion line

00:29:43,217 --> 00:29:44,551
that I created, which is called
twinkle cheeks.

00:29:44,618 --> 00:29:46,320
So what do you do
for a living, Kyle?

00:29:46,386 --> 00:29:48,288
I'm a Mr. Mom,
I'm an artist,

00:29:48,355 --> 00:29:49,423
and I'm an inventor.

00:29:49,489 --> 00:29:52,192
Okay, and does your wife
make a lot of money?

00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:54,228
My wife, uh, has financially
supported our family

00:29:54,294 --> 00:29:55,329
for 13 years now.

00:29:55,395 --> 00:29:56,496
She's wonderful.

00:29:56,563 --> 00:29:58,232
She is the most amazing woman
Anybody could ask for.

00:29:58,298 --> 00:30:00,567
So she's basically funding
your goal to have one of these

00:30:00,634 --> 00:30:01,568
work out for you.
That's right,

00:30:01,635 --> 00:30:03,537
and I am at the point
in my life

00:30:03,604 --> 00:30:07,241
where I just really need
to succeed,

00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:09,276
so that she doesn't have
to work so hard.

00:30:09,343 --> 00:30:12,145
Okay, Kyle, this is not going
to be the one that succeeds.

00:30:12,212 --> 00:30:13,580
I think you've got
that message loud and clear.

00:30:13,647 --> 00:30:15,349
We've all seen this.

00:30:15,415 --> 00:30:17,217
There's nothing proprietary
about it.

00:30:17,284 --> 00:30:18,318
I'm out.

00:30:20,387 --> 00:30:22,256
I gotta tell ya,
Barbara's right.

00:30:22,322 --> 00:30:23,357
It looks dated.

00:30:25,292 --> 00:30:26,493
I'm out.

00:30:28,362 --> 00:30:31,231
I've seen ten of these
in the last year

00:30:31,298 --> 00:30:34,268
that either were already
on the market

00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:35,369
or already doing sales.

00:30:35,435 --> 00:30:36,436
I'm out.

00:30:39,439 --> 00:30:41,575
Kyle,
the important thing is,

00:30:41,642 --> 00:30:44,144
it doesn't matter
how many times you fail.

00:30:44,211 --> 00:30:46,180
All it takes is one,

00:30:46,246 --> 00:30:49,216
then everybody can call you
an overnight success...

00:30:49,283 --> 00:30:50,484
(chuckles) That's True.
So don't quit...

00:30:50,551 --> 00:30:52,586
mm-hmm.
Because We've all been
laughed at.

00:30:52,653 --> 00:30:54,221
I know I've been laughed at,

00:30:54,288 --> 00:30:57,124
and my biggest hits have been
the ones people thought

00:30:57,191 --> 00:30:58,358
were most likely to fail.

00:30:58,425 --> 00:30:59,359
You are...

00:30:59,426 --> 00:31:00,360
I'm out.

00:31:00,427 --> 00:31:02,462
Okay.
Thank you for your time.

00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:03,463
(daymond and Barbara)
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,332
Good luck, Kyle.
Thank you.

00:31:08,268 --> 00:31:10,204
(Kyle) It's pretty humiliating.

00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,305
I'm just kinda wondering,
you know,

00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:14,174
did I make the right move
in taking it here?

00:31:14,241 --> 00:31:16,243
But, you know, you--
you can't live life like that.

00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,478
You just have to try
and--and keep on going.

00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:20,447
That wife is incredible.

00:31:20,514 --> 00:31:22,115
Either that
or he's a good dad,

00:31:22,182 --> 00:31:23,116
and she's smart
for letting him

00:31:23,183 --> 00:31:24,218
keep on doing it.
That's True.

00:31:24,284 --> 00:31:25,285
He's home looking
after the Kids.

00:31:25,352 --> 00:31:27,254
That's the best job
in the world.

Hi.
My name is Megan Cummins.

00:31:58,185 --> 00:31:59,953
My company is you smell,

00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,022
and I'm seeking
a $55,000 investment

00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:04,391
in exchange for 20%
of the company.

00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:06,994
You smell is
a new luxury soap brand

00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,028
That's a breath
of fresh air

00:32:08,095 --> 00:32:10,264
in An oftentimes snooty
marketplace.

00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:14,067
It has delicious fragrances
and a vibrant personality.

00:32:14,134 --> 00:32:15,335
You smell started out
as a class project

00:32:15,402 --> 00:32:16,370
back in college.

00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:18,105
I was taking
a package design class,

00:32:18,172 --> 00:32:21,074
and I had free rein to develop
any product I wanted.

00:32:21,141 --> 00:32:23,377
I wanted to develop something
that had personality,

00:32:23,443 --> 00:32:26,113
and what instantly came
to mind was you smell.

00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,315
I didn't want to be blinded
by, um, excitement,

00:32:28,382 --> 00:32:31,351
so I decided to do
a trial run to test the market.

00:32:31,418 --> 00:32:34,288
I had about 1,200 bars made
in 2 custom fragrances--

00:32:34,354 --> 00:32:36,924
Lemon verbena
and Lavender Mint.

00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,025
Um, I brought you all
some samples,

00:32:38,091 --> 00:32:39,193
so you can smell them.

00:32:39,259 --> 00:32:42,329
So look at this. It says,
"you smell" On the front,

00:32:42,396 --> 00:32:44,398
and you flip it around,
and it says, "Lemon."

00:32:44,464 --> 00:32:46,033
You smell like a Lemon,
Barbara.
(chuckles)

00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:47,201
"Like a Lemon."
It's cute.

00:32:47,267 --> 00:32:49,203
Since I haven't opened,
uh, my doors yet

00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:52,139
to actually have a revenue,
I have tested the market.

00:32:52,206 --> 00:32:53,273
I actually told
a few blogs--

00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,275
Oh, so you haven't sold
any of you smell yet?

00:32:55,342 --> 00:32:57,277
No, I'm still pre-venture,
actually.

00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:00,047
So you have bars just sitting
in a warehouse or what?

00:33:00,113 --> 00:33:02,182
No, actually I had those made
and already got rid of them,

00:33:02,249 --> 00:33:03,951
sending them out
to different companies,

00:33:04,017 --> 00:33:06,153
and then almost overnight
it ended up going international,

00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,088
you know--new York,
L.A., and Canada, australia--

00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:09,389
did you sell them,
or you gave them away?

00:33:09,456 --> 00:33:11,091
I did sell them,
'cause I wanted to see

00:33:11,158 --> 00:33:13,093
how much people were willing
to pay for them.

00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,394
And what did you learn?
And what--Yeah.

00:33:14,461 --> 00:33:16,163
Well, people were
selling them,

00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:19,066
surprisingly,
for between $7 to $12 a bar,

00:33:19,132 --> 00:33:21,001
but I also found that
there were a lot of companies,

00:33:21,068 --> 00:33:23,303
some very big names,
that, um, actually wanted it

00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:25,205
to be more like
$4.50, $5.00.

00:33:25,272 --> 00:33:26,206
So what kind of names?

00:33:26,273 --> 00:33:27,975
When you say big names,
who are they?

00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:30,043
The biggest one would be
urban outfitters.

00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,979
They asked, you know,

00:33:32,045 --> 00:33:33,180
how fast I could have
stuff made,

00:33:33,247 --> 00:33:34,248
in what quantities,

00:33:34,314 --> 00:33:36,016
and then what
the price point would be.

00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:38,385
Megan, what--what is this?
Is this a paper product,

00:33:38,452 --> 00:33:40,020
a paper version of the soap?
Yeah, it--it's actually--

00:33:40,087 --> 00:33:41,154
it's paper soap,

00:33:41,221 --> 00:33:43,090
um, so it's smaller
than a little packet of gum.

00:33:43,156 --> 00:33:44,291
You can fit it
in your purse, your pocket.

00:33:44,358 --> 00:33:45,993
I've never seen
that before.

00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:47,227
It's something
that would be an--you know,

00:33:47,294 --> 00:33:48,328
an impulse buy
at a register.

00:33:48,395 --> 00:33:49,997
And you sell it for...

00:33:50,063 --> 00:33:54,067
the soap bars are going to be
roughly about 80 cents.

00:33:54,134 --> 00:33:55,936
Retail, that would be
about $2.25.

00:33:56,003 --> 00:33:57,337
Not bad margins.
Not bad margins.

00:33:57,404 --> 00:33:59,006
Great margins.
I like it.

00:33:59,072 --> 00:34:01,108
Megan, if I invest
in your company here--

00:34:01,175 --> 00:34:03,277
I'm a slave driver, right,
and I demand a lot,

00:34:03,343 --> 00:34:04,278
so I'd be invest--
oh, my goodness.

00:34:04,344 --> 00:34:05,946
You're gonna love me.

00:34:06,013 --> 00:34:07,014
(mark and Barbara laugh)

00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,148
I'm probably
the most tenacious person

00:34:08,215 --> 00:34:09,416
you're ever going to meet.

00:34:09,483 --> 00:34:11,151
I mean,
with your business skills

00:34:11,218 --> 00:34:14,154
and, you know, your connections
and financial backing,

00:34:14,221 --> 00:34:16,957
combined with my tenacity
and my addiction to caffeine,

00:34:17,024 --> 00:34:17,958
um, it's unstoppable.
(sharks laugh)

00:34:18,025 --> 00:34:19,126
Addiction to caffeine.
(laughs)

00:34:19,193 --> 00:34:20,928
Have you planned out what you
would do with the $50,000?

00:34:20,994 --> 00:34:22,329
It's actually just
going primarily

00:34:22,396 --> 00:34:23,997
to building the product.

00:34:24,064 --> 00:34:26,967
Do you have an order from
somebody to sell it to them?

00:34:27,034 --> 00:34:28,402
Um, I-I don't have
actual P.O.S,

00:34:28,468 --> 00:34:30,103
um, 'cause y--I don't want
to promise something

00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,272
and then something fall through
and not be able to get it.

00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:34,274
So, Megan, um...

00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:39,146
I have to admire your tenacity,

00:34:39,213 --> 00:34:42,316
but this is not really
a business I'm interested in.

00:34:42,382 --> 00:34:44,384
I'm out.

00:34:46,486 --> 00:34:48,222
You're in
a brutally competitive market.

00:34:48,288 --> 00:34:51,058
I mean, anybody, including me,
if I wanted to,

00:34:51,124 --> 00:34:53,260
could find a Megan
and get into the soap business,

00:34:53,327 --> 00:34:55,262
so the only thing
of Value here is a brand,

00:34:55,329 --> 00:34:56,363
which is unproven Yet.

00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,065
Good luck to you,

00:34:58,131 --> 00:34:59,299
and I'm impressed
with your presentation,

00:34:59,366 --> 00:35:02,169
but it doesn't make it easy
for me to smell the money.

00:35:02,236 --> 00:35:03,370
I'm out.

00:35:04,404 --> 00:35:06,273
(inhales deeply)

00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:12,279
All right, Megan.
I'm--I'm Teeter-tottering.

00:35:12,346 --> 00:35:14,081
I mean, what makes you
the person

00:35:14,147 --> 00:35:17,217
to take this
from concept and design

00:35:17,284 --> 00:35:19,353
all the way
through to success?

00:35:19,419 --> 00:35:22,356
Um, well, I guess
the first, um, example

00:35:22,422 --> 00:35:25,192
would be that I decided that
I was gonna give it a go,

00:35:25,259 --> 00:35:28,195
and in about a month,
I had international press.

00:35:28,262 --> 00:35:29,930
You know, I had magazines
in the states.

00:35:29,997 --> 00:35:31,098
"Tatler" In the U.K. Wrote
about me.

00:35:31,164 --> 00:35:32,299
But, you know,
that's short-lived.

00:35:32,366 --> 00:35:34,935
It doesn't mean you're gonna
continuously get that press,

00:35:35,002 --> 00:35:37,070
and it doesn't mean you can
always convert it to sales.

00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:38,305
What--what skills
do you have

00:35:38,372 --> 00:35:39,973
that are gonna give us
confidence,

00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,341
or give me confidence to say,
"you know what?

00:35:41,408 --> 00:35:45,212
Once We get past the hype,
we can deliver."

00:35:48,282 --> 00:35:50,217
Uh, there's nothing
that can stop me.

00:35:50,284 --> 00:35:52,052
Trust me.
If you teach me ropes,

00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:53,053
and you tell me
what I need to do,

00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,188
I will get it done,

00:35:54,254 --> 00:35:55,389
and you don't even have
to think about it again.

00:35:55,455 --> 00:35:57,157
That's what gonna be so great
about working with me.

00:35:57,224 --> 00:35:58,158

so you're not in here
asking for enough.

00:37:29,016 --> 00:37:32,920
But I'm gonna give you
the... $55,000,

00:37:32,986 --> 00:37:35,789
but I must take...

00:37:35,856 --> 00:37:38,158
40% of your business.

00:37:40,761 --> 00:37:42,029
Because the truth
of the matter is,

00:37:42,095 --> 00:37:44,865
I have to make a return,

00:37:44,932 --> 00:37:48,135
and I also need a dime
for every bar you sell.

00:37:52,105 --> 00:37:54,041
So if you'll give me
a dime a bar

00:37:54,107 --> 00:37:57,678
and you'll give me 40%
of your business for $55,000,

00:37:57,744 --> 00:38:00,047
I would love to be
your partner,

00:38:00,113 --> 00:38:03,817
and you'll just be
another success Story.

00:38:05,118 --> 00:38:06,887
Okay.

00:38:06,954 --> 00:38:08,055
I'm gonna start to cry.
And I'd love to have
an answer now.

00:38:08,121 --> 00:38:09,790
I--really, I'm so moved.
Don't be--you--

00:38:09,857 --> 00:38:10,991
oh, hush. (chuckles)

00:38:11,058 --> 00:38:13,861
All that warm and fuzzy stuff
came out to a bloodsucking offer

00:38:13,927 --> 00:38:15,796
of 40% of your company.

00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:20,901
This is a no-brainer.
My offer is clearly Better.

00:38:20,968 --> 00:38:22,836
(inhales deeply and sighs)
Oh, my goodness.

00:38:22,903 --> 00:38:24,671
Megan, I can smell
the blood in the water.

00:38:24,738 --> 00:38:27,641
You've got Barbara.
You've got, uh, mark circling.

00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:29,009
You can also smell
the Lemons, too.

00:38:29,076 --> 00:38:30,644
I can smell the Lemons...
(chuckles)

00:38:30,711 --> 00:38:32,713
And, uh, most importantly,
I smell your drive.

00:38:32,779 --> 00:38:33,881
I didn't write you off.

00:38:33,947 --> 00:38:34,915
Thank you. (chuckles)
I don't make a judgment

00:38:34,982 --> 00:38:36,817
on how people look,
unlike Barbara...

00:38:36,884 --> 00:38:38,952
(chuckles)
Uh...

00:38:39,019 --> 00:38:39,987
do you have your own job?

00:38:40,053 --> 00:38:41,688
I work, um, for myself
independently

00:38:41,755 --> 00:38:42,823
as a graphic designer.

00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,625
Do you want to do
this full-time?

00:38:44,691 --> 00:38:45,959
I--that's why I'm here.
(chuckles)

00:38:46,026 --> 00:38:47,694
I think it's
a fantastic product.

00:38:47,761 --> 00:38:48,695
I think it's
a great brand...

00:38:48,762 --> 00:38:49,696
thank you.

00:38:49,763 --> 00:38:52,633
But my concern is,

00:38:52,699 --> 00:38:55,636
are you gonna quit
your other job?

00:38:55,702 --> 00:38:58,639
Yeah, I-I pretty much
already have. (chuckles)

00:38:58,705 --> 00:39:00,874
Well, pretty much is not
all of it.

00:39:00,941 --> 00:39:03,810
Yes. Yes. Already have.
It's said and done. This is--

00:39:03,877 --> 00:39:04,811
how will you--how will
you support yourself, though?
This is my life now.

00:39:04,878 --> 00:39:06,046
So this is 100%?
I'm sorry?

00:39:06,113 --> 00:39:07,047
How will you support yourself
when you quit your other job?

00:39:07,114 --> 00:39:08,815
I've been a little chipmunk.

00:39:08,882 --> 00:39:12,052
I've been stowing things away
so that I could make this jump.

00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:14,621
Megan, look, I've had
a ton of experience

00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,056
supporting entrepreneurs.

00:39:16,123 --> 00:39:19,793
I know what it's like to be
an entrepreneur and starve.

00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,628
I know what it's like
to have all your dreams

00:39:21,695 --> 00:39:23,063
just sitting there
right in front of you,

00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:24,097
and you're just
knowing that

00:39:24,164 --> 00:39:25,933
if I just had somebody
WHO could help me

00:39:25,999 --> 00:39:27,067
and who had been
there before,

00:39:27,134 --> 00:39:28,936
they could get me
over the top.

00:39:29,002 --> 00:39:30,003
That's who I am.

00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,872
That's why
I'm sitting here,

00:39:31,939 --> 00:39:35,108
and that's why I like to get
involved with people like you.

00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:39,713
Here's what I think
you need to do.

00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,849
I smell success in you.

00:39:41,915 --> 00:39:44,017
This is purely
an investment in you.

00:39:44,084 --> 00:39:46,854
I think what you need is,
you need some cash flow

00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,722
to give you the freedom
to make the right decisions.
She is so far--

00:39:48,789 --> 00:39:50,891
no, Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You are so far from desperate...

00:39:50,958 --> 00:39:52,693
So let me--
you should just be laughing
at that.

00:39:52,759 --> 00:39:55,095
No, no, but, Megan,
mark isn't listening.

00:39:55,162 --> 00:39:57,064
He's hearing half the story.

00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:59,867
I think what the offer
needs to be is,

00:39:59,933 --> 00:40:03,036
the business needs
$55,000 for the 20%,

00:40:03,103 --> 00:40:04,972
but I think you need
a salary along the way

00:40:05,038 --> 00:40:06,907
in the first year.

00:40:06,974 --> 00:40:09,910
You have taken this and done
a lot of amazing things.

00:40:09,977 --> 00:40:11,078
That's why you're getting
so much interest.

00:40:11,144 --> 00:40:15,949
My offer would be to pay you
the $55,000 for the 20%,

00:40:16,016 --> 00:40:18,685
but pay you another $50,000
for you to live

00:40:18,752 --> 00:40:20,821
in the first 12 months,
so you have the freedom...

00:40:20,888 --> 00:40:22,723
(chuckles)
to make the right decisions

00:40:22,789 --> 00:40:24,625
and grow the business...
(Kevin) You guys are all nuts.

00:40:24,691 --> 00:40:25,659
'cause that's what
I believe in.
This isn't gold bars.

00:40:25,726 --> 00:40:28,762
This is soap. This is crazy.

00:40:29,897 --> 00:40:31,765
Pick an offer.

00:40:34,835 --> 00:40:38,172
I'm gonna edit my offer
for you, all right?

00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:44,912
I'll give you the $55,000
for the 30%.

00:40:44,978 --> 00:40:46,947
Megan, before--

00:40:47,014 --> 00:40:48,949
Megan--
wait. Let me just add
something here.

00:40:49,016 --> 00:40:51,718
In the big picture
of things, right,

00:40:51,785 --> 00:40:52,819
it's not about the cash.

00:40:52,886 --> 00:40:54,755
It's about who's gonna give
you the support.

00:40:54,821 --> 00:40:57,791
I can make available time
and experience and access

00:40:57,858 --> 00:40:58,926
to my other companies
as well.

00:40:58,992 --> 00:41:02,062
I think the money
in the first year is important.

00:41:02,129 --> 00:41:03,664
Right now it's about survival.

00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:04,698
I think a little extra Cash

00:41:04,765 --> 00:41:07,067
is gonna help you
go on the right path,

00:41:07,134 --> 00:41:08,902
and I believe in you.
You're gonna get there.

00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:10,938
(Barbara) but it's not
an important card here.

00:41:11,004 --> 00:41:12,105
You know what's
an important card here?

00:41:12,172 --> 00:41:14,875
That you get lined up
with the right distributor.

00:41:14,942 --> 00:41:16,944
You're not gonna be
successful

00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:18,645
because of
other people's success.

00:41:18,712 --> 00:41:20,681
You're gonna be successful
because of your own success.

00:41:20,747 --> 00:41:23,083
But let me tell you, women work
Harder, and you know it.

00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,084
Ohh.
I work circles
around this guy.

00:41:24,151 --> 00:41:25,953
Oh, please.
Oh, boy.

00:41:26,019 --> 00:41:27,020
Absolutely.
Really?

00:41:27,087 --> 00:41:28,789
I-I got here
because I didn't work?

00:41:28,856 --> 00:41:29,857
No. Women work Harder
than men.

00:41:29,923 --> 00:41:30,991
(imitates violin)
(chuckles)

00:41:31,058 --> 00:41:32,926
Put one woman against a man
in any situation...

00:41:32,993 --> 00:41:34,828
Please.
She will outwork
the guy anytime.

00:41:34,895 --> 00:41:35,929
Girl power.
You know why?

00:41:35,996 --> 00:41:37,698
All right.
Enough, enough, enough.
(laughs)

00:41:37,764 --> 00:41:39,700
Megan, you gotta make
a call.

00:41:39,766 --> 00:41:41,702
What are you going to do?

00:41:44,738 --> 00:41:47,007
I love all the offers,
and I love all of you guys.

00:41:47,074 --> 00:41:49,810
Um, Barbara, I've always wanted
you to be my business mom...

00:41:49,877 --> 00:41:54,114
(chuckles) But starting out
this first couple of years,

00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:56,717
money is crucial.

00:41:56,783 --> 00:41:58,719
I think I'm going to go
with Robert's deal.

00:41:58,785 --> 00:41:59,720
Ohh.

00:41:59,786 --> 00:42:01,822
Oh, great decision.

00:42:01,889 --> 00:42:03,824
Is that a final decision,
Megan?

00:42:03,891 --> 00:42:04,825
(inhales deeply)

00:42:04,892 --> 00:42:05,826
Yes.

00:42:05,893 --> 00:42:07,628
I would--
I would think twice.

00:42:07,694 --> 00:42:09,630
I would think twice
about that final.

00:42:09,696 --> 00:42:11,064
Thank you. Thank you.
(laughs)

00:42:11,131 --> 00:42:13,066
Congratulations. Great job.

00:42:13,133 --> 00:42:14,935
You made a mistake, Megan.

00:42:15,002 --> 00:42:16,837
(chuckles)
(Kevin) All of that,

00:42:16,904 --> 00:42:18,772
and she just took the money.

00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:20,974
It makes me feel
warm and fuzzy Inside.
(mark) Wow.

00:42:22,743 --> 00:42:23,977
Choosing between
Those three amazing deals

00:42:24,044 --> 00:42:26,947
was really difficult,
but having that extra money

00:42:27,014 --> 00:42:28,782
is really what helped tip
the scales,

00:42:28,849 --> 00:42:29,917
um, and I think
Robert's going to be

00:42:29,983 --> 00:42:32,119
a great business partner for me.
