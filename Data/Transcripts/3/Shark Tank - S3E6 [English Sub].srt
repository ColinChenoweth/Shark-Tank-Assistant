00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:02,936
<i>(man) the sharks are back.</i>

00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,771
<i>They're looking for the best</i>
<i>products and Businesses</i>

00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,206
<i>America has to offer.</i>

00:00:06,273 --> 00:00:10,210
<i>And tonight, guest shark</i>
<i>LORI Greiner joins the tank.</i>

00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:12,312
I'm gonna write you
a check write now.

00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:15,816
<i>Hopeful entrepreneurs</i>
<i>come to the shark tank</i>

00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:17,184
<i>seeking an investment</i>

00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:21,088
<i>to start, grow, or save</i>
<i>their businesses.</i>

00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:22,689
Tell me about sales.

00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:24,358
No sales to date.

00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:26,059
Why should we invest in you?

00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:29,029
Sales from a $10,000 investment
were $120,000.

00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:31,965
<i>If the sharks hear</i>
<i>a great idea,</i>

00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,868
<i>they're ready to invest,</i>
<i>using their own money...</i>

00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:36,370
I have $400,000.

00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:38,372
I've just put it on this table.
Let's pretend it's there.

00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:40,607
<i>And fight each other</i>
<i>for a piece of the action.</i>

00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:43,677
If I walk, you lose the tv,
and the tv isn't easy for mark.

00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:46,947
Actually, I own two tv networks,
so that's not the problem.

00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:49,616
Let's talk about reality here,
Buddy.

00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:51,852
There's absolutely nothing
proprietary about this.

00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:53,687
You hire them and you know
what they do right after that?

00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:55,589
They're quit 'cause
you're a son of a bitch

00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:56,957
and they won't want
to work with you.
Oh, that's crap.

00:00:57,024 --> 00:00:59,359
<i>But first, the entrepreneurs</i>
<i>must convince a shark</i>

00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,028
<i>to invest the full amount</i>
<i>they're asking for,</i>

00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:03,030
<i>or they'll walk away</i>
<i>with Nothing.</i>

00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:06,567
You're saying,
"Hey, let's get married,"

00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:11,004
and I'm saying... (chuckles)
"Hey, buy me a drink first."

00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,540
This is a real slick Willie
over here.

00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,042
<i>It's sink...</i>

00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:17,444
<i>or swim.</i>

00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:19,813
I gotta tell you,
you can take a lot of abuse

00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,549
and still hang in there.
I like that about you.

00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:25,219
<i>Who are the sharks?</i>

00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:28,622
<i>They're five self-made,</i>
<i>filthy rich Investors.</i>

<i>Who's hoping to sell the sharks</i>
<i>on one of his many ideas.</i>

00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:36,023
This is going to be fun.

00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:39,359
My name is Jared Joyce.
I'm an inventor/entrepreneur,

00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:42,563
and today,
in exchange for $250,000,

00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,198
I'm offering you 25% equity

00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:47,267
in my patented
five-minute furniture.

00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,671
In my hand are
assembly instructions

00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,940
for one of my competitor's
furniture designs.

00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,843
They are printed on several
pages, in multiple languages,

00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:59,479
and they come with
a frustrating bag of hardware.

00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:03,517
My furniture Designs
require none of this.

00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:04,051
Let me show you.

00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:08,589
This is a cube design,
and the first thing to notice

00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,023
is this patented joint,

00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,928
which allows us to comfortably
slide two side walls together,

00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,264
to create
a flush right corner.

00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:19,032
Notice that all side walls are
identical,

00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:23,437
so there's no confusion
as to what part to grab

00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:25,472
or in What order to assemble.

00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:29,877
You simply grab and go.

00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:31,445
Once the side walls are
connected,

00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:33,881
we have created a perimeter

00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:37,718
for our Backer piece
to rest on.

00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:41,555
And finally, this is
the rotational lockdown.

00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:43,056
This is the piece that makes
this ease of assembly

00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:45,025
like nothing
you have ever known.

00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:47,394
Simply drop it in,

00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:48,896
quarter turn...
(Click)

00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:51,865
and Boom. Can't come apart.

00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:53,600
Wow.
Thank you.

00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:57,371
We currently have over 30
designs using this joint system.

00:03:57,437 --> 00:04:00,207
And this joint system can be
applied to any 4-sided object--

00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:04,144
tables, chairs, dressers,
desks, bookshelves.

00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:05,045
For those of you who have

00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:07,047
ever purchased
the traditional bookshelf,

00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:10,217
you know that if you are lucky--
if you are <i>lucky--</i>

00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:12,119
it will take you
at least an hour

00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:13,020
to put that bookshelf together.

00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:16,757
These bookshelves assemble,
with no tools required,

00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,959
in under five minutes.

00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,930
So I invite you
to come up and play,

00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,399
experience
this ease of assembly.

00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:29,169
Or if you prefer, we can jump
into the always exciting q &amp; a.

00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:31,872
Q &amp; A sounds good to me.
Let's do it, Kevin.

00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,640
Why don't you tell me
about sales?

00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:36,710
No sales to date.

00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,645
Our second patent issued
four months ago.

00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:41,215
We currently have two companies
interested in Licensing.

00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,117
So, Jared, you put a $1 million
value on your company

00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:47,287
by asking me to give you
$250,000 for 25%.

00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:48,422
Correct.

00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,390
Is your strategy
from day one

00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,092
not to bother
trying to get distribution,

00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,026
but to simply license it?

00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:55,729
Let me give you
my thoughts on that.

00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,031
I am no stranger when it comes
to getting paid to go away.

00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:00,634
(mark and Robert laugh)

00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:02,102
trust me, neither is Kevin,
but usually by his dates.

00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:07,341
Licensing is
how I made my money.

00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,643
You made your money?
Have you made money before?

00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,812
I run a research
and development Firm.

00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,747
Uh, we currently have over
80 products in the portfolio,

00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,449
and this is one of them.

00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:18,352
But the reason I don't think we
should license this technology

00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:21,021
is that regardless
of the next dot-com BOOM

00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:22,723
or next best-selling app,

00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,224
the world will need
furniture solutions.

00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,760
So, Jared,
what have you invented

00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:30,097
in that portfolio of 80
or 90 patents, however many,

00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,031
that's made any money?

00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:34,568
Uh, only one so far is
making money.

00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:36,303
What is that product?
I'm just curious.

00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,038
That product is called
the plug hub.

00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:39,673
How much money has it made?

00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,942
Uh, it's been on the market
for a month.

00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:45,112
I think they sold
10,000 units.

00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,681
Now how much money do you have
invested in this?

00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:50,050
Uh, in this--
w-with All my designs,

00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:53,253
I try not to put in
more than $1,000 myself.

00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,789
$1,000?
S-so with that,

00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,392
there's $250,000
of investor funds in this.

00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:02,796
So the $250,000 you spent is
purely on getting to today?

00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:03,030
Correct.

00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:06,466
Are you offering us equity

00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,436
in your company
or in this one product?

00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:11,038
Today I'm pitching
the five-minute Furniture.

00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,106
As you can imagine, if we do
this deal and we like it,

00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:15,309
we like each other,
of course I'd be open

00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,311
to discussing more deals
in the future.

00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,680
Why aren't we getting offered
anything

00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,114
in the company in general?

00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:26,253
The problem with That statement
is that you're saying,

00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,589
"Hey, let's get married,"

00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:32,826
and I'm saying... (chuckles)
"Hey. Buy me a drink first."

00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:36,063
This is a real slick Willie
over here.

00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,565
(laughs)
I got it.

00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:40,667
You're saying that you're
putting me on an interview

00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,369
when I may give you
a quarter-million dollars

00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:44,171
for a bunch of plastic stuff,

00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:46,139
and you may employ
a bunch of people

00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:49,443
to go and push all your other
brands, make the contacts.

00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,044
No, that's not
what you're saying.

00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:53,380
You're saying We get
a piece of all the products.

00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:55,449
No.
That's not what
he's saying at all, Robert.

00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:59,219
If you're lucky enough
to invest in his <i>one </i>product,

00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:01,421
you may impress him enough
to give him more money

00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,056
for the rest of the crap
he has.
Exactly.

00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:05,058
I'm out.

00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:08,295
Jared, I-I just have to ask
because I'm curious.

00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:10,931
$250,000 you've raised
for this patent.

00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:13,634
How much money have you raised
across the other 79 products

00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,102
that you've designed?

00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:17,271
Uh, a total
of about $1 million.

00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:19,106
How long ago
did you start raising money

00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:21,608
for your first design?
Seven years ago.

00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:23,443
How many of those investors
have you returned

00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,413
all of their funds for?
So far, none.

00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:30,617
You're serving
too many masters.

00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:32,619
If I gave you $250,000,

00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:35,389
you have to eat, sleep,
and breathe this one deal.

00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,090
I don't see you doing that.

00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:39,860
I think you're an inventor
extraordinaire in your own mind.

00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:40,093
So I'm out.

00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,667
Jared, let me tell you what--
what I'm struggling with here.

00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:49,570
When I take a dollar
from an investor,

00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:53,874
I feel a <i>huge, </i>a huge amount
of responsibility for that.

00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:55,542
I want to pay them back.

00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:58,045
I will pay them back
before I eat.

00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:00,047
So I just don't have
the confidence

00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:02,449
in you to deliver.

00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:04,818
I like the product.
I just don't trust you.

00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:07,921
I'm out.

00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,727
<i>Three sharks are out.</i>

00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:18,498
<i>Lori and Kevin are Jared's</i>

I understand the importance
of what you've done.

00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:23,437
I think it's brilliant.

00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:26,039
I really like this.
I like that you have patents.

00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:29,810
But I don't want
all of your other stuff,

00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:32,479
the baggage
that goes around with this.

00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:34,448
So I'm willing
to make an offer to you

00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:37,117
if another shark
will go in with me.

00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,953
I'll put up $125,000,

00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,089
but I want 100% of this.

00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:43,724
We'll buy the patents.

00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,058
We'll take over doing
the furniture ourselves.

00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:48,562
And you go back and you do
what you were doing

00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:50,564
with everything else
and everybody else.

00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:53,066
But you gotta get Kevin.

00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:54,968
I'm there.
It's a slick move, Lori.

00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,504
So you're gonna buy
the whole thing,

00:08:57,571 --> 00:08:59,139
fire him before
he even leaves out of here.

00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,808
(Lori) Yep.
I like that.

00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,043
(Kevin) Jared, let me tell you
why you should do this deal.

00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:06,547
Your history so far
has been a Roach Motel.

Dollars go in.
They never come out.

00:09:09,183 --> 00:09:12,119
After seven years,
no return of capital investors.

00:09:12,186 --> 00:09:13,453
That's bad.

00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,556
Here's an opportunity,
with Lori and I,

00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:17,057
to have your first huge win.

00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:19,560
You have nothing now for this.

00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:22,529
2 minutes from now,
you have $250,000 cash.

$250,000
for 100% of the patent,

00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:28,368

You can make $250,000

to work on--I don't even know
how many others you have.

00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:20,521
This is your pass. This is it.
You get your money back,

00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:23,023
you take it, and you rebuild
on something else.

00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,958
The ability to do that
is amazing,

00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:26,593
and the risk is Lori's and mine.

00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,197
We have to figure out
how to get our money back.

00:10:30,264 --> 00:10:32,065
I'll make this easy
for you guys, in that

00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,368
when I look
at the people that I lead,

00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,570
the people that depend on me
for employment,

00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:38,839
I could do more, be more,
lead more

00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:41,008
if I could plug in
to your networks

00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,809
and work with you.

00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:46,747
So I am very much interested
in becoming a partner with you.

00:10:48,282 --> 00:10:50,918
Uh, for me, I like our deal.

00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,320
I say you're out.

00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:59,126
At the end of the day,
you don't bring any value

00:10:59,193 --> 00:11:01,061
beyond what you've done so far.

00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:03,463
This is the honest, brutal,
hard truth,

00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,566
and we should deal with that
right now.

00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:08,569
What are we looking at
as far as licensing and your--

00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:11,205
doesn't matter. You're
out of it. You're gone.

00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:12,806
No, I mean, as far
as my percentage of royalties

00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:14,875
that I would take
into the Future.

00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:17,177
None. We get 100%.
You're done.

00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:20,881
This deal is
we give you $250,000 cash,

00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:22,716
and you don't have
my phone number.

00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:28,455
So you're giving me
an opportunity to break even

00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:29,790
but not make a profit
for my investors.

00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:32,526
Right--right now you have
no profit, no return of capital,

00:11:32,593 --> 00:11:35,229
no track record
of any return...
right.

00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,997
And a whole bunch
of really unhappy Shareholders.

00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:40,100
Seven years is an eternity

00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:42,703
for an investment
that never returns anything.

00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:45,506
You know, honestly,
I go with my gut.

00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:47,608
I don't think you're going
to be a good businessperson

00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:49,343
or partner for me,

00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:53,146
and so I like the deal that
we've put on the table for you.

00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:57,117
But if you won't take that deal,
then I'm gonna rescind it.

00:11:57,184 --> 00:12:00,454
Again, my preference comes to
I want to be partners with you,

00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:02,256
I want to build a business.

00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:03,724
If you're not interested
in that--

00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,893
back to your concern
of paying back investors,

00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,928
I'm--I'm on that.
But with that,

00:12:07,995 --> 00:12:10,430
I would need a royalty,
because otherwise, all I'm doing

00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:11,999
to my investors is saying,

00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,967
"Hey, it's been seven years.
We broke even."

00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:15,669
Jared, you're not listening.

00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:17,671
We're not interested
in partnering with you.

00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:20,541
We want to give you
a quarter of a million dollars,

00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,843
end of story.
Do you want to take it or not?

00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,212
I want to hear your answer
in 15 seconds or I'll be out.

00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:28,682
What are you gonna do, Jared?

00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:31,251
It's now or never.

00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:36,790
I would not be doing right
by my investors

00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:38,559
to say that I took 7 years,

00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:42,129
$250,000, we're breaking even,
no opportunity.

00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:43,964

for sticking to his guns.

That guy had so many patents,
so many products.

00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:55,008
I think he made a huge mistake.
Huge Mistake.
He did make a huge mistake.

00:17:03,257 --> 00:17:05,259
from white, dark, milk,

00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:07,361
to butterscotch,
peanut butter, and mint,

00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:09,463
and then top them
with unique toppings

00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,199
like Candy bars,
nuts, and even fruit.

00:17:12,266 --> 00:17:13,934
Oh, wow.

00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:17,004
Mmm.

00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,372
Mmm.

00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:19,339
This is fantastic.

00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:20,941
Mmm!

00:17:21,008 --> 00:17:23,343
I'm here because I would
really like a strategic partner

00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,279
and I need the investment.

00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:27,181
We've had a great start,

00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:29,316
but it's nowhere near
Its full potential

00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:31,118
and I could really
use your help.

00:17:31,185 --> 00:17:34,188
The painted pretzel is fun,
it's yummy, it's unique,

00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:36,356
it's working,
and most importantly,

00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:39,593
it's positioned to make
both of us some serious cash.

00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,594
So who's ready?

00:17:40,661 --> 00:17:42,296
Raven, give us
some numbers on sales.

00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:46,266
Over the last 12 months,
we've done about $75,000.

00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:50,838
We just got another order in
last week for $64,000.

00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:55,175
And not only that--
I have $140,000 worth of orders

00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:58,545
that I did not have
the capital to Fill.

00:17:58,612 --> 00:18:00,113
Who was that with?

00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,217
We have neiman Marcus,
we're in, um, Sam's club,

00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:05,385
Stein mart, airports--

00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:07,855
how long? For how long
have you been in those places?

00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:10,190
This is our fourth season
in neiman Marcus.

00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:13,360
We've sold out in some
of their stores in one day,

00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:15,262
online in less than a week.

00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:19,566
You said your typical order from
a large retailer is $60,000...

00:18:19,633 --> 00:18:20,634
mm-hmm.

00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:23,203
But your total sales last year
were $75,000.

00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,771
Did I hear that correct?

00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:26,807
You heard that correct,
but we also--

00:18:26,874 --> 00:18:30,043
I also have a $140,000
that I was not able to fill.

00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,379
Okay, Raven,
the thing that's troubling me--

00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:33,514
and I think you're gonna
have to answer this now...

00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,715
okay.

00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,917
There's many,
many pretzels on the market

00:18:36,984 --> 00:18:38,218
with chocolate on 'em.

00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:39,453
Right.

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,788
There's nothing unique.
So the question is,

00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:44,591
for the painted pretzel,
what's different,

00:18:44,658 --> 00:18:47,127
what makes you any better,

00:18:47,194 --> 00:18:49,196
and why are you gonna
be able to survive

00:18:49,263 --> 00:18:51,198
if there's nothing unique
about what you do?

00:18:51,265 --> 00:18:56,170
Our--our product is just--
is based on awesome ingredients

00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:58,639
and quality of ingredients,
the style, the packaging--

00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:00,807
makes us totally unique
to the market.

00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:05,145
You will not find another one
even comparable to us.

00:19:05,212 --> 00:19:06,280
What do you sell

00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:10,250
that rou--larger round tin
to neiman Marcus for?

00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:11,852
Um, $14.50.

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,254
$14.50, and it costs you
how much to make it?

00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:16,857
Um, just under--
like, around $7. $7.

00:19:16,924 --> 00:19:18,425
$7 to make.

00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:21,361
What I'm really curious about is
you're selling it to neiman's,

00:19:21,428 --> 00:19:24,198
but how many times a year
do they order?

00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:27,067
Um, they order
a couple times in the fall

00:19:27,134 --> 00:19:28,869
and then they'll
do it again in the spring.

00:19:28,936 --> 00:19:30,804
How many stores
are they putting these in?

00:19:30,871 --> 00:19:33,173
In every one of their stores
and Online. They're--

00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,509
what flavors
are they ordering?
An assortment.

00:19:35,576 --> 00:19:37,177
They don't decide
what's in it. I do...
got it.

00:19:37,244 --> 00:19:38,679
And they take it
like that.

00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:40,948
So they say,
we want a unique assortment,

00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:43,350
because you're saying is,
Everybody else is selling

00:19:43,417 --> 00:19:45,319
the black, the white,
the basic stuff, right...
right

00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:47,054
and you're able to come in
and say, look,

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,089
I'm gonna have a really cool
gift that someone can give...

00:19:49,156 --> 00:19:52,092
right.
'cause it's got Heath, coconut,
all these funky flavors.

00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:53,093
Right.

00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,295
Raven, can I see that tin?

00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:58,932
My kids will eat anything
that you put chocolate on.

00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:00,567
Work with me on this
for a second,

00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:02,302
because this is
my moment with you.

00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:05,339
I have $400,000.
I've just put it on this table.

00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:06,340
Let's pretend it's there.

00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:08,175
Okay.

00:20:08,242 --> 00:20:10,978
I get this tin--
can I borrow that for a second?

00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:14,014
I put it beside the $400,000,

00:20:14,081 --> 00:20:19,052
and I go online and I say,
who can make me pretzels

00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:22,189
with stuff and chocolate
and flavoring on them

00:20:22,256 --> 00:20:24,258
that look like this?

00:20:25,626 --> 00:20:27,394
How many people,
you think, Can do that?

00:20:27,461 --> 00:20:28,929
I think, a lot.

00:20:28,996 --> 00:20:31,565
Maybe, but they can't
do it like me.
Sure they can.

00:20:31,632 --> 00:20:33,000
They can't--
(mark) no, they can't.
You know why?

00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:34,868
Because you've put your heart,
your soul, and your love

00:20:34,935 --> 00:20:37,171
into it, and you care
about the business.
That's just wonderful.

00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:39,173
It's called sweat equity,
Kevin...
that's just wonderful.

00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,208
And you might not like to do
work, but some people do, right?
That's just wonderful.

00:20:41,275 --> 00:20:42,843
Cry me a river, mark.
Sweat--Sweat equity
has value.

00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,312
Let's talk about
reality here, Buddy.
The reality--

00:20:45,379 --> 00:20:47,381
there's absolutely nothing
proprietary about this at all.
And you know
what happens next, Kevin?

00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:49,349
And it's not worth $400,000.
You know what happens next?

00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,618
You hire them, and you know
what they do right after that?

00:20:51,685 --> 00:20:53,453
They quit 'cause
you're a son of a bitch

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,355
and they won't want
to work for you.
Oh, that's crap.

00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:56,356
She's not going anywhere.
This is her baby.
So look,
at the end of the day,

00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:58,058
we got to deal
with reality.

00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:01,061
If you can't tell me why I can't
hire somebody just like you

00:21:01,128 --> 00:21:03,997
to make this
with a $400,000 pile of cash--

00:21:04,064 --> 00:21:05,265
I bet you only have to spend
$20,000 to get this done.

00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:07,100
Kevin, it's not
a computer business.

00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:10,437
It doesn't matter!
There's no proprietary
software here.

00:21:11,905 --> 00:21:14,608
If you had to say to us
right now

00:21:14,675 --> 00:21:18,779
why we should invest in this,
give us your very best.

00:21:18,846 --> 00:21:20,647
Why should we invest in you?

00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:23,684
The main reason is because
I have two little kids

00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,253
and I'm showing them that
you just follow your dreams,

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,189
you can do whatever you decide
to do with your life.

00:21:29,256 --> 00:21:32,025
I'm doing it, I'm successful,
and I'm-a keep going.

00:21:32,092 --> 00:21:34,061
It makes me happy
and it's fun.

00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:37,564
It's, you know, it's something
that I really love to do.

00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:42,803
That's not enough for me.

00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:45,038
Yeah, you know what, Raven?

00:21:45,105 --> 00:21:47,875
That's a good story,
but it's not a good reason.

00:21:47,941 --> 00:21:49,343
Okay.

00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:51,011
(Robert) This is
the real world of business.
Right.

00:21:51,078 --> 00:21:52,880
When someone like that
asks you that question,

00:21:52,946 --> 00:21:55,382
you got to give her
a benefit as investor,

00:21:55,449 --> 00:21:57,184
so let's do that again.

00:21:57,251 --> 00:21:58,685
Okay. Let's do it again.
Don't tell me
about your family--

00:21:58,752 --> 00:22:01,588
well, before--before
you do that again, I'm out.

00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,691
Good.

00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:11,698
Give us one reason
that we should invest in it.

00:22:11,765 --> 00:22:14,168
One reason is that...

00:22:14,234 --> 00:22:16,837
and maybe you would change
your mind when I say this--

00:22:16,904 --> 00:22:18,038
ain't gonna happen.

00:22:18,105 --> 00:22:19,339
Okay.

00:22:19,406 --> 00:22:23,210
Well, I had to walk away
from a $2 million deal

00:22:23,277 --> 00:22:25,345
because I did not have
the capital to fill the Order.

00:22:25,412 --> 00:22:26,947
Hello.

00:22:27,014 --> 00:22:29,049
That's a good reason.
That's a good reason,
I would think.

00:22:29,116 --> 00:22:30,918
That was better. Good job!

00:22:30,984 --> 00:22:34,254
Shut the front door.
(laughs)

00:22:34,321 --> 00:22:35,355
Good for you.

00:22:35,422 --> 00:22:37,357
Wh--who was it from?

00:22:37,424 --> 00:22:38,592
Sam's club.

00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:40,394
You got an ORDER
from Sam's club...
yes.

00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,695
And you had to
walk away from it?
For $2 million?

00:22:41,762 --> 00:22:42,696
I had to walk away
from that because--

00:22:42,763 --> 00:22:44,264
how long ago was that?

00:22:44,331 --> 00:22:47,568
I just spoke to them last week,
and the door's wide open.

00:22:47,634 --> 00:22:50,137
I could fill the same order
within the next 12 months.

00:22:50,204 --> 00:22:51,171
Okay, Raven, I'm gonna
sell you now, right?

00:22:51,238 --> 00:22:53,974
Do you have an interest
in being my partner?

00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:57,344
I do. I'm here. You rock.
Okay. Well, I'm gonna make it
very, very simple for you.

00:22:57,411 --> 00:22:58,779
I own the mavericks, right?

00:22:58,846 --> 00:23:00,547
Yes.
We could sell those
in our Arena.

00:23:00,614 --> 00:23:01,682
Absolutely.

00:23:01,748 --> 00:23:03,617
Did you know that I own
landmark theatres?

00:23:03,684 --> 00:23:05,118
Absolutely.

00:23:05,185 --> 00:23:08,188
We can sell those
all across landmark theatres.

00:23:08,255 --> 00:23:11,425
I'm prepared to give you
$100,000 for 25%

00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:13,427
if you're ready
to say yes right now.

00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:15,295
Wh--

00:23:15,362 --> 00:23:17,397
you <i>better </i>say yes right now.

00:23:17,464 --> 00:23:19,800
Yeah, you better say yes.

00:23:19,867 --> 00:23:21,802
I'm ready to say yes right now.

00:23:21,869 --> 00:23:22,803
Done.

00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,171
Wow.

00:23:24,238 --> 00:23:26,673
(Robert and Lori sputter)
Congratulations.

00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,208
(Raven) Thank you.
There's no negotiation.

00:23:28,275 --> 00:23:30,377
He just gave her exactly
what she was looking for.

00:23:30,444 --> 00:23:31,712
I got one problem with these.
I will eat 'em all,

00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:33,313
so you're not allowed
to send me any.
Eat them all.

00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,649
Thank you.
Thanks, Raven.
We'll be in touch very shortly.

00:23:35,716 --> 00:23:38,552
(Lori and mark) Good Luck.
Thank you very much.

00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:40,254
Yes!

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,722
I'm so excited
that the painted Pretzel's

00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:44,525
gonna be at the maverick games
and landmark theatres.

00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:46,293
It's like a dream come True.

00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,427

00:24:37,511 --> 00:24:41,014
in exchange
for 20% of the company.

00:24:41,081 --> 00:24:45,552
Every day, our bodies
are bombarded by positive ions,

00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:47,054
which are molecules

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,890
that are simply emitted
from Electronic devices--

00:24:49,957 --> 00:24:52,259
computers, tvs,
fluorescent lighting.

00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:55,195
Too much positive ion
on our bodies

00:24:55,262 --> 00:24:57,064
puts unnatural pressure on us.

00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:00,501
What we have done is, we use
the counterpart of positive ion

00:25:00,567 --> 00:25:02,936
to help bring our body back
to its more natural state,

00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:04,638
Called negative ion.

00:25:04,705 --> 00:25:06,907
What we do is,
we put it in our watches,

00:25:06,974 --> 00:25:11,845
and it helps restore
our energy field in our bodies.

00:25:11,912 --> 00:25:13,514
Just want to make sure what
you're telling me here, Ryan.

00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,748
You're basically saying

00:25:14,815 --> 00:25:18,519
this positive-negative Ion thing
is a real health concern.

00:25:18,585 --> 00:25:20,921
'cause it sounds a little,
you know...

00:25:20,988 --> 00:25:21,822
fluffy?

00:25:21,889 --> 00:25:25,692
Well, it sounds a lot
like a coffee enema.

00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:28,195
Supposedly good for you,
but who knows, right?

00:25:28,262 --> 00:25:29,596
Right.

00:25:29,663 --> 00:25:31,999
You might be a little skeptical
if it indeed works,

00:25:32,065 --> 00:25:33,934
so I'd like to do
a quick balance test

00:25:34,001 --> 00:25:35,369
to see if you can
feel the difference.

00:25:35,435 --> 00:25:37,571
So anybody want to try?

00:25:38,906 --> 00:25:40,841
All right.
(mark) go for it, Lori.

00:25:40,908 --> 00:25:42,109
(Ryan) This is gonna
test your balance,

00:25:42,176 --> 00:25:45,179
so what I want you to do is,
put both arms out like a "T,"

00:25:45,245 --> 00:25:47,347
and then just resist my pressure
So let me put a little pressure.

00:25:47,414 --> 00:25:50,017
So now just stand on your
left foot. Are you balanced?

00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:51,518
(laughs) No.

00:25:51,585 --> 00:25:52,819
(mark) That's good!
(Robert)
she can't even do that!

00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:55,055
This is a good challenge because
I can't even stand. Right.

00:25:55,122 --> 00:25:57,057
Now just put on--put on a watch.
Got a pink one just for you.

00:25:57,124 --> 00:25:59,193
Now if it works,
then we know it works.

00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:00,194
Okay.

00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,496
A pink one.

00:26:02,563 --> 00:26:03,897
Okay.

00:26:03,964 --> 00:26:04,898
Mm-hmm.

00:26:04,965 --> 00:26:07,668
Just resist.

00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:08,869
Resist.

00:26:08,936 --> 00:26:10,304
Looks like it's working,
doesn't it?

00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,839
Yeah, you look like you have
more balance in that one.

00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:13,140
That's a little weird.

00:26:13,207 --> 00:26:15,075
Yeah. Do you feel it?
Little difference?

00:26:15,142 --> 00:26:16,476
Well, yeah.

00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:21,682
So I actually have a few watches
for each of you guys to have.

00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:25,352
Thank you very much.
Here you go.
Here's yours.

00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:27,554
No, Thanks. Go ahead.
You keep it.

00:26:27,621 --> 00:26:30,090
It's Dallas Mavericks blue
just for you.
That's okay.
You keep it.

00:26:30,157 --> 00:26:31,491
Okay.
Thank you.

00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:33,927
Mark, are you allergic to
positive-negative ion stuff?

00:26:33,994 --> 00:26:36,730
No, I'm allergic to scams.

00:26:36,797 --> 00:26:40,601
Seriously. This is not new.
It's been disproven.

00:26:40,667 --> 00:26:42,669
What you saw
is the placebo effect.

00:26:42,736 --> 00:26:46,773
There's athletes that wear it.
It's a joke. It's a scam.

00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,177
It's not real. I'm out.

00:26:50,244 --> 00:26:51,311
Okay. Thank you.

00:26:51,378 --> 00:26:52,946
What do you <i>really </i>think,
mark?

00:26:53,013 --> 00:26:56,884
I think it's a joke,
it's a scam, and I'm still out.

00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:01,855
Well, what I want to know--
are you selling any of these?

00:27:01,922 --> 00:27:06,760
Sales from a $10,000 investment
were $120,000 in just 12 months.

00:27:06,827 --> 00:27:08,495
Okay, so some people
are buying them.

00:27:08,562 --> 00:27:10,564
That's--have you made
any money on the $110,000?

00:27:10,631 --> 00:27:12,866
I have. We have about
$70,000 in Profit.

00:27:12,933 --> 00:27:14,902
Really?

00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:16,270
Do you pay
to acquire your customers?

00:27:16,336 --> 00:27:17,671
How are you getting them?

00:27:17,738 --> 00:27:19,740
No, my background is in
search engine optimization,

00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:22,643
so we are the top of
all the organic search results.

00:27:22,709 --> 00:27:23,944
I like that.

00:27:24,011 --> 00:27:25,145
We--we don't spend
anything in marketing

00:27:25,212 --> 00:27:27,748
other than my time that
I dedicate with my background.

00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:29,816
So you're basically getting
your customers for free.

00:27:29,883 --> 00:27:30,884
Correct.

00:27:32,886 --> 00:27:35,889
How do you get the negative ions
in this rubber band?

00:27:35,956 --> 00:27:38,492
When We're melting the silicone
into the molds,

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,061
we put the negative ion chemical
into the silicone.

00:27:41,128 --> 00:27:42,896
With a wand?

00:27:42,963 --> 00:27:44,264
(laughs)

00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:46,867
You're saying they constantly
emit out of here.

00:27:46,934 --> 00:27:48,902
How do you know
when they run out?

00:27:48,969 --> 00:27:50,604
I mean--
it--has a net charge.

00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:52,806
Do you have
laboratory testing on this?

00:27:52,873 --> 00:27:57,911
Independent Laboratory testing
that shows that it really works?
<i>Hell, </i>No. <i>Hell, </i>No.

00:27:57,978 --> 00:27:59,446
Laboratory testing?

00:27:59,513 --> 00:28:01,548
Yeah.
That's what he needs to have.

00:28:01,615 --> 00:28:03,851
Okay.
I mean, to be able
to sell something like this

00:28:03,917 --> 00:28:06,720
on any tv medium whatsoever,
you have to have

00:28:06,787 --> 00:28:09,156
independent laboratory testing
that shows your claims.

00:28:09,223 --> 00:28:11,358
Otherwise, the f.T.C.'s
gonna be all over you.

00:28:11,425 --> 00:28:12,726
No, we don't have anything.

00:28:12,793 --> 00:28:15,729
It's a common thing--for
positive ions and negative ions.

00:28:15,796 --> 00:28:16,864
We're just neutralizing
the effects

00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:19,233
of the positive ions.
It's been around for years.

00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:23,070
I've got to say, I think
this is a liability nightmare.

00:28:23,136 --> 00:28:26,673
You don't have any claims that
you can back up, so I'm out.

00:28:27,741 --> 00:28:29,743
And so you created this watch?

00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:32,446
This design--I didn't
originate the design.

00:28:32,513 --> 00:28:35,949
My other two designs
are my own original design.

00:28:36,016 --> 00:28:37,484
So you're saying that

00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:39,853
you already purchased
the first watch That's shown,

00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,855
but you designed
the other two?
Yep.

00:28:41,922 --> 00:28:44,091
I helped take a company
called rumbatime,

00:28:44,157 --> 00:28:46,693
and they have
the exact same line,

00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,029
so you're lying.

00:28:49,096 --> 00:28:50,998
And with that, I'm out.

00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:51,999
Are you lying?

00:28:52,065 --> 00:28:53,734
No. W-which design?

00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,068
Which are you referring to?
All three.

00:28:55,135 --> 00:28:58,338
No, those are--
the bottom two are unique to me.

00:28:58,405 --> 00:29:01,608
I designed those.
The other one is a--
I'll ship you a box.

00:29:01,675 --> 00:29:04,578
Well, more than one person
can make a watch like that.

00:29:04,645 --> 00:29:07,548
I mean, a lot of people make
the same design all the time.

00:29:11,618 --> 00:29:15,022
I feel one
with the ion right now.

00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:16,823
(laughs)
I'm just trying to figure out

00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:18,926
if I can make any money
on this deal.

00:29:18,992 --> 00:29:20,661
Kevin, I'm gonna warn you.

00:29:20,727 --> 00:29:23,397
If you even try to make money
from this, I will come over

00:29:23,463 --> 00:29:25,999
and just beat the living crap
out of you. It's horrible.
(laughs)

00:29:26,066 --> 00:29:29,603
Well, Ryan, Everybody's
calling you a scam artist,

00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:30,804
one guy called you a liar,

00:29:30,871 --> 00:29:33,106
and you're just kind of
sucking it all in.

00:29:33,173 --> 00:29:34,775
He's wearing his watches.

00:29:34,842 --> 00:29:38,512
Yeah. I-I've got my balance.
I'm not... emotional.
(sharks laugh)

00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:40,814
I got to tell you,
you can take a lot of abuse

00:29:40,881 --> 00:29:43,817
and still hang in there.
I like that about you.

00:29:43,884 --> 00:29:47,321
Look, Ryan, I don't believe
in any of this. I'm out.

00:29:47,387 --> 00:29:48,856
Thank you.

00:29:48,922 --> 00:29:50,858
There's been a lot
of interesting discussion

00:29:50,924 --> 00:29:53,727
about scam here today.
Now how about this?

00:29:53,794 --> 00:29:57,998
If you admit it's a scam,
maybe I'll invest.

00:29:58,999 --> 00:30:00,934
Is it a scam?

00:30:01,001 --> 00:30:02,803
I d--I don't believe it is.

00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,304
Okay, so my options are,

00:30:04,371 --> 00:30:05,973
I invest and have the crap
beaten out of me by mark cuban.

00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:07,808
I don't like that too much.

00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:10,677
You're telling me it's real,
but can't get it on tv

00:30:10,744 --> 00:30:12,446
because it's not accredited

00:30:12,513 --> 00:30:14,748
by anybody
in the medical profession.

00:30:14,815 --> 00:30:18,185
I don't see an OPTION here
except to say I'm out.

00:30:18,252 --> 00:30:21,755
Okay. Thank you for your time.
I appreciate it.

00:30:21,822 --> 00:30:24,057
(Lori) Good luck.

00:30:24,124 --> 00:30:25,692
Bad Luck.

00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:27,027
Mojo.

00:30:27,094 --> 00:30:28,896
(Robert) You know what?
I don't care what you think,

00:30:28,962 --> 00:30:30,864
but you got to believe
in your business.

00:30:30,931 --> 00:30:31,798
Why didn't the guy
defend himself?

00:30:31,865 --> 00:30:33,400
That was the turning point
for me.

00:30:33,467 --> 00:30:34,735
We beat him up pretty Badly.

00:30:34,801 --> 00:30:36,470
Yeah, and he's not
a fighter, either.

00:30:36,537 --> 00:30:37,671
What is he, a lover, Lori?

00:30:37,738 --> 00:30:40,941
(laughs)
He's a lover, not a fighter.

00:30:41,008 --> 00:30:42,943
It frustrates me that--

00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:45,679
that mark cuban clouded
the water for the other sharks.

00:30:45,746 --> 00:30:47,481
It's too bad that
they weren't able to--

00:30:47,548 --> 00:30:49,850
to focus on me and my product

00:30:49,917 --> 00:30:52,853
rather than Being
scared off by mark Cuban.

00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,856

(laughs)

00:31:27,254 --> 00:31:29,223
Hello, Lori, gentlemen.

00:31:29,289 --> 00:31:33,460
My name is Rick Hopper,
and my business is readerest.

00:31:33,527 --> 00:31:39,199
I'm seeking $150,000 in exchange
for 15% of my company.

00:31:39,266 --> 00:31:42,402
I <i>hate </i>losing my glasses.

00:31:42,469 --> 00:31:47,274
Like many people, I'll spend
up to $500 on quality eyewear,

00:31:47,341 --> 00:31:49,309
and the wasted time
and high cost

00:31:49,376 --> 00:31:52,145
of Eyewear replacement
is <i>terrible.</i>

00:31:52,212 --> 00:31:53,947
I've talked to 1,000 people

00:31:54,014 --> 00:31:55,916
who share
the same exact frustrations

00:31:55,983 --> 00:31:59,453
with losing, dropping,
and scratching <i>their </i>glasses.

00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,488
The most common
solution people use

00:32:01,555 --> 00:32:04,358
are these granny chains
and ropes

00:32:04,424 --> 00:32:05,559
that hang around our neck.

00:32:05,626 --> 00:32:08,462
They're annoying
and they look goofy,

00:32:08,529 --> 00:32:11,899
and nobody wants to be
a goofball or a granny.

00:32:11,965 --> 00:32:15,269
Another option--we hang
our glasses in our shirt,

00:32:15,335 --> 00:32:17,404
stretching out our collars.

00:32:17,471 --> 00:32:21,208
The next thing you know,
your glasses are in the toilet!

00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:24,411
Have you ever had to fish
anything out of the toilet?

00:32:24,478 --> 00:32:27,414
I have,
and it's not pretty, bro.

00:32:27,481 --> 00:32:28,549
But now there's hope.

00:32:28,615 --> 00:32:31,051
I call it readerest.

00:32:31,118 --> 00:32:33,520
Here's how it works.

00:32:33,587 --> 00:32:36,823
Take the stainless steel
back plate embedded with Magnets

00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:39,059
hidden under your clothes.

00:32:39,126 --> 00:32:42,462
Stainless steel front clip
easily self-centers

00:32:42,529 --> 00:32:44,531
onto the back plate.

00:32:44,598 --> 00:32:46,667
You simply hang your reading
glasses or your sunglasses.

00:32:46,733 --> 00:32:48,368
Bam. Check it out.

00:32:48,435 --> 00:32:50,904
I can jump around,
swing a golf club,

00:32:50,971 --> 00:32:54,074
bend over all I want,
and they're not going anywhere.

00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:56,376
Matter of fact,
I can take a major tumble,

00:32:56,443 --> 00:32:59,079
and there they are,
safe and sound as usual,

00:32:59,146 --> 00:33:02,649
right where I left 'em
and always within Arm's reach.

00:33:02,716 --> 00:33:08,488
I brought samples so you can
feel the power of readerest.

00:33:08,555 --> 00:33:09,823
Got a special one for you.

00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:12,960
Oh, thank you--
ohh, mine has diamond.
(Robert) Thanks.

00:33:13,026 --> 00:33:14,394
(Robert) Real diamonds?

00:33:14,461 --> 00:33:15,863
(Lori) Well, you know...

00:33:15,929 --> 00:33:17,798
(Robert)
It's a strong magnet, Rick.

00:33:17,865 --> 00:33:19,733
(Lori) Yeah.

00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:24,304
So Rick, uh, $160,000
is what you said, for 15%?

00:33:24,371 --> 00:33:26,240
$150,000 for 15%.

00:33:26,306 --> 00:33:27,741
So Rick, honey,
sweetie, poopsie,

00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,409
you must have a lot of sales.

00:33:29,476 --> 00:33:30,878
(sighs) Well...

00:33:30,944 --> 00:33:33,480
actually, uh, I started
doing sales in the beginning.

00:33:33,547 --> 00:33:37,718
I was able to generate $65,000
in sales in a market test mode,

00:33:37,784 --> 00:33:39,052
but here's what happened.

00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:41,989
Because I was burning
through inventory so fast,

00:33:42,055 --> 00:33:43,357
I had to go back
into production mode

00:33:43,423 --> 00:33:44,391
for the last couple of months.

00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:46,026
Do you make these yourself?

00:33:46,093 --> 00:33:47,361
Yes.

00:33:47,427 --> 00:33:51,198
Actually, I, uh, have personally
hand-glued over 100,000 magnets.

00:33:51,265 --> 00:33:52,799
Come on. You--really?
(Lori) You're kidding.

00:33:52,866 --> 00:33:54,535
This is not made
in a factory anywhere?

00:33:54,601 --> 00:33:57,404
No. No. Actually, I have
a little, uh, little, uh, shop.

00:33:57,471 --> 00:33:58,805
How much do you sell this for?

00:33:58,872 --> 00:34:04,378
Uh, they retail
for between $9.99 and $19.99.

00:34:04,444 --> 00:34:06,613
For one set?
Wow.
That's a lot of Money.

00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,716
Uh, Yes. Actually,
neodymium magnets aren't cheap.

00:34:09,783 --> 00:34:12,152
Uh, it's a high-quality
Stainless steel...

00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:13,487
right.
And there's
labor involved,

00:34:13,554 --> 00:34:14,721
and you guys know how much
packaging costs, so--

00:34:14,788 --> 00:34:16,723
well, how much
does it cost you to make one?

00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:20,127
It costs me a buck and a Nickel
for the basic ones

00:34:20,194 --> 00:34:23,130
and around $2
for the--the one--

00:34:23,197 --> 00:34:25,165
with the most of
the swarovski crystals on 'em.

00:34:25,232 --> 00:34:27,367
How did you come up
with this?
Well, what I did was,

00:34:27,434 --> 00:34:30,137
I started bending paper clips
into different shapes.

00:34:30,204 --> 00:34:33,207
I have a--one of my originals
right here, one of my favorites.

00:34:33,273 --> 00:34:35,242
Paper Clips bent
into different shapes,

00:34:35,309 --> 00:34:36,810
and, uh,
epoxied 'em to magnets,

00:34:36,877 --> 00:34:38,745
put a piece of metal
under my shirt,

00:34:38,812 --> 00:34:40,347
and I was in business.

00:34:40,414 --> 00:34:42,549
And shazam--
old Jed's a millionaire.
Nine months later,

00:34:42,616 --> 00:34:46,954
I realize I got pestered
every day by several people,

00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,789
"How are your glasses
staying on your shirt?"

00:34:48,856 --> 00:34:51,191
and by the time I explain it to
'em, they're like, "Oh, my gosh.

00:34:51,258 --> 00:34:53,994
Where do I get one of those? I
can't keep track of my glasses."

00:34:54,061 --> 00:34:55,028
Is there a patent on this?

00:34:55,095 --> 00:34:56,463
Yes, sir.

00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:59,299
I have a, uh, utility patent
and a registered trademark

00:34:59,366 --> 00:35:00,400
on readerest.

00:35:00,467 --> 00:35:03,070
I-I bought the patent
from the original Owner.

00:35:03,136 --> 00:35:05,572
B-but What did your--you know--
I thought you said
you invented it.

00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:06,473
I thought--Yeah.

00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,408
(daymond) huh?
I did. I did. Let me explain.

00:35:08,475 --> 00:35:10,077
I designed the product.

00:35:10,143 --> 00:35:12,446
I went--I started getting
a lot of interest,

00:35:12,513 --> 00:35:14,147
so I went to do
a patent search...

00:35:14,214 --> 00:35:17,284
okay.
And was extremely disappointed
to find the patent--

00:35:17,351 --> 00:35:20,187
it was already done.
Did a little research...

00:35:20,254 --> 00:35:21,555
so you own the patent?
(daymond) So you got it?

00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:22,890
So you bought it?
You bought the Pat--

00:35:22,956 --> 00:35:23,891
I went and secured the patent.
I own the patent.

00:35:23,957 --> 00:35:25,492
This is all happening
so fast--

00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:26,627
what did you pay for it?

00:35:26,693 --> 00:35:29,029
$5,000.
Ohh.

00:35:29,096 --> 00:35:31,231
You found the guy who invented
it. You paid him $5,000.

00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:33,267
Yes.
And you own it free and clear?

00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:34,368
Free and clear.

00:35:34,434 --> 00:35:35,469
So Rick, Rick.

00:35:35,536 --> 00:35:38,438
I would say to you,
I acquired a patent for $5,000,

00:35:38,505 --> 00:35:45,045
but I'm gonna value my company
to you at a million dollars.

00:35:45,112 --> 00:35:46,747
You see anything wrong
with that?

00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:47,915
Yes, absolutely.

00:35:47,981 --> 00:35:49,983
You know, no investor
likes to speculate

00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,985
and take risks at that level,

00:35:52,052 --> 00:35:53,320
and I completely
understand that,

00:35:53,387 --> 00:35:54,821
and my argument to that
would be,

00:35:54,888 --> 00:35:58,358
in a very short period of time,
with very little effort,

00:35:58,425 --> 00:36:00,894
I generated $65,000 in sales.

00:36:00,961 --> 00:36:04,698
The potential--
when I'm in 5,000 stores,

00:36:04,765 --> 00:36:08,569
it equates to $6 million a year
in gross profits,

00:36:08,635 --> 00:36:12,573
and one of the reasons I'm here,
it's a strategic partner,

00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:15,108
and I'm willing to give
more percentage of my company.
Oh, that's right. I forgot.

00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:17,778
We have to give you the $150,000
and then we have to work, too.

00:36:17,845 --> 00:36:19,446
(laughs)
No. No, you don't.

00:36:19,513 --> 00:36:22,115
Actually, I actually--
with your connections--

00:36:22,182 --> 00:36:24,718
information is the most valuable
commodity in the world.

00:36:24,785 --> 00:36:27,321
So now you want us
to give you the money,

00:36:27,387 --> 00:36:29,723
work, and then pass off
our connections.

00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,725
Yes. Actually, n--

00:36:31,792 --> 00:36:34,294
and I am out.

00:36:35,295 --> 00:36:36,363
Here's the thing.

00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:38,532
I have a question.
You're not a salesperson.

00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:40,567
Would you say that's
not really your strength?

00:36:40,634 --> 00:36:43,604
I'm--I wouldn't consider mys--
I'm a--I-I create things.

00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:46,540
I've been designing little
things since I was 13 years old.

00:36:46,607 --> 00:36:48,542
So you're an inventor,
but maybe not a good marketer?

00:36:48,609 --> 00:36:50,444
True.
Good salesperson?

00:36:50,511 --> 00:36:52,312
So you really need somebody
who will come in

00:36:52,379 --> 00:36:54,481
and take over
and make this work for you.

00:36:54,548 --> 00:36:57,217
Exactly.
Okay. I'm--I'm gonna
make you an offer.

00:36:57,284 --> 00:37:00,521
I'm gonna make you
an offer for...

00:37:00,587 --> 00:37:02,623
$150,000,

00:37:02,689 --> 00:37:06,793
but I need 65% of the company.

00:37:07,794 --> 00:37:08,996
(sighs)

00:37:09,062 --> 00:37:11,498
and I'll get this on tv

00:37:11,565 --> 00:37:14,034
and I'll blow out--
I'll make you a millionaire.

00:37:14,101 --> 00:37:15,369
'cause I--

00:37:15,435 --> 00:37:17,371
the minute you walked in here,
I knew that this was a Winner.

00:37:17,437 --> 00:37:19,540
I think it's a great product...

00:37:19,606 --> 00:37:22,309
thank you.
And I want to help you
to make this a huge success,

00:37:22,376 --> 00:37:24,077
but I think you need
someone like me.

00:37:24,144 --> 00:37:27,447
This sitting on a store shelf--
it's just gonna sit and die.

00:37:27,514 --> 00:37:30,484
You need somebody Who's
going to show this all the time,

00:37:30,551 --> 00:37:33,387
and tv's the perfect medium
to show this.

00:37:33,453 --> 00:37:35,989
The product demonstrated--
it brings it to life.

00:37:36,056 --> 00:37:38,225
You're right, the product
sitting on a shelf like that,

00:37:38,292 --> 00:37:40,727
it's--retail would be--
I believe retail will be

00:37:40,794 --> 00:37:43,463
a difficult avenue
for this product.

00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:46,166
However...

00:37:46,233 --> 00:37:47,534
um... the P--

00:37:47,601 --> 00:37:50,537
well, I have the background
in which to get this

00:37:50,604 --> 00:37:54,808
to infomercial and on tv,
so are you in or are you out?

00:37:54,875 --> 00:37:56,910
Is that my only offer?

00:37:56,977 --> 00:37:59,012
(chuckles)

00:38:00,814 --> 00:38:02,049
Are you in or are you out?

00:38:02,115 --> 00:38:03,817
I'd like to counter.

00:38:03,884 --> 00:38:05,452
What are you countering?
I'd like to consider...

00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:08,789
I would like you
to consider, um,

00:38:08,856 --> 00:38:11,525
49% of the company.

00:38:11,592 --> 00:38:12,392
No.

00:38:12,459 --> 00:38:14,862
I'm a little--
I'm a little gun-shy

00:38:14,928 --> 00:38:17,564
in Giving up total controlling
interest of the company

00:38:17,631 --> 00:38:20,534
without a complete buyout option
with Royalties.

00:38:20,601 --> 00:38:22,069
All of a sudden you got smart.

00:38:22,135 --> 00:38:23,470
Oh, he just became
a businessman.

00:38:23,537 --> 00:38:24,771
Whoa. How'd that happen?

00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:26,540
I think he was
always a businessman.

00:38:26,607 --> 00:38:28,876
Well, I-I did design some--
you seemed a little scattered,
my friend,

00:38:28,942 --> 00:38:30,310
and all of a sudden,

00:38:30,377 --> 00:38:32,579
when money comes to the table,
you get crystal Clear.

00:38:32,646 --> 00:38:35,349
Look, Rick, now that we're
talking about real money,

00:38:35,415 --> 00:38:36,817
let me tell you where I stand.

00:38:36,884 --> 00:38:39,419
At best, I saw this
as a knickknack

00:38:39,486 --> 00:38:42,022
that was sold at gas stations
and places like that.

00:38:42,089 --> 00:38:44,391
I'm not seeing the value
that Lori is.

00:38:44,458 --> 00:38:46,326
I'm out.

00:38:46,393 --> 00:38:48,662
Okay, Robert.

00:38:48,729 --> 00:38:51,965
I look at it and say,
a $1 million valuation

00:38:52,032 --> 00:38:54,535
for a little piece of metal
with two magnets on it?

00:38:54,601 --> 00:38:57,971
That's sheer insanity.
I'm out.

00:39:00,941 --> 00:39:03,143
Mark, what are you doing?

00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:06,580
I'm processing.

00:39:06,647 --> 00:39:10,584
While he's processing,
I want you to give me an answer.

00:39:12,052 --> 00:39:15,722
Are you shutting out cuban?
Before he speaks again.

00:39:16,857 --> 00:39:20,060
Wow.
I need an in or out.

00:39:20,127 --> 00:39:22,129
This is brutal.

00:39:22,196 --> 00:39:24,698
Lori, can I please have
just one second here?

00:39:24,765 --> 00:39:27,067
'cause I would love
to do business with you,

00:39:27,134 --> 00:39:29,803
but this company is gonna
make a lot of Money.

00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:32,439
Well, here's the thing. I'm
gonna make you a lot of money.
Let me help you. Let--let me
help you. Let me help you.

00:39:32,506 --> 00:39:33,473
Wait, mark, wait.

00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,075
I'm gonna make you
a lot of money.

00:39:35,142 --> 00:39:37,411
I'm gonna get this on tv.
You know I have the audience.

00:39:37,477 --> 00:39:38,779
You know I have
millions of viewers

00:39:38,846 --> 00:39:40,647
that already watch my show
on qvc.

00:39:40,714 --> 00:39:43,517
Rick, baby,
is this not your moment?
I know. I know.

00:39:43,584 --> 00:39:46,053
So they love everything
that I bring them.
This is my one big chance.
I love this...

00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:47,387
This is perfect for--
but--

00:39:47,454 --> 00:39:48,789
wait, Rick. Feel the Karma.

00:39:48,856 --> 00:39:50,123
Feel the Karma.

00:39:52,793 --> 00:39:54,027
What a moment.

00:39:54,094 --> 00:39:55,662
What a moment--
take it, grab it,

00:39:55,729 --> 00:39:57,497
'cause I could walk.
Can I please hear
What mark has to say?

00:39:57,564 --> 00:39:59,299
(Kevin) ooh!
You know what?

00:39:59,366 --> 00:40:02,603
(Robert) Wow.
If I walk, you lose the tv,
and the tv isn't easy for mark.

00:40:04,037 --> 00:40:06,974
Actually, I own two tv networks,
so that's not the problem.

00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,643
Yeah, but they're not--they're
not home shopping Networks.

00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,478
Remember that.

00:40:11,545 --> 00:40:14,047
But I'm--I'm gonna help you,
Rick, 'cause I like you.

<i>Three sharks are out.</i>

00:40:33,672 --> 00:40:35,007
<i>Rick has an offer from Lori</i>

00:40:35,073 --> 00:40:39,211
<i>of $150,000</i>
<i>for 65% of his company,</i>

00:40:39,278 --> 00:40:41,280

<i>What mark has to say.</i>

00:40:41,346 --> 00:40:45,217
I'm--I'm gonna help you, Rick,
'cause I like you.

00:40:45,284 --> 00:40:50,089
There are better options,
and for that reason, I'm out.

00:40:52,291 --> 00:40:54,960
Ooh, and then there was one.

00:40:55,027 --> 00:40:56,161
Yes.
And there was one.

00:40:56,228 --> 00:41:01,433
So it was $150,000
for 65% of the company.

00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,169
Would you consider...

00:41:04,236 --> 00:41:05,537
that's--
take it

00:41:05,604 --> 00:41:08,173
or leave it.
Is that your
flat dead only offer?

00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,409
It's my flat dead,
but you're gonna be happy.

00:41:12,444 --> 00:41:14,113
(sighs)

00:41:14,179 --> 00:41:16,548
Rick, baby. What do you do?

00:41:16,615 --> 00:41:18,083
You know, 35%...

00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:21,754
of a watermelon.
Of $10 million
is very exciting to me.

00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:24,089
And it beats gluing them
in your garage.

00:41:24,156 --> 00:41:26,125
You're not gonna
have to do anything

00:41:26,191 --> 00:41:29,027
but sit back
and watch the money roll in.

00:41:31,597 --> 00:41:33,699
Lori, you got a deal.
I'd love to do this.

00:41:33,766 --> 00:41:34,933
Great.
Wow.

00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,168
Congrats, Lori.

00:41:36,235 --> 00:41:37,169
Congrats.

00:41:37,236 --> 00:41:38,837
Thanks. Great Idea.

00:41:38,904 --> 00:41:40,105
Thank you.
(kisses)

00:41:40,172 --> 00:41:41,673
Very cool, Rick.

00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,909
Thank you, guys.
It's been a--been a blast.

00:41:43,976 --> 00:41:45,110
(mark) Congrats.

00:41:45,177 --> 00:41:47,012
Piece of metal with Two magnets
just got $150,000.

00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:48,614
Congratulations.

00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,215
What are you gonna do?
(Lori)
That's America for you.

00:41:50,282 --> 00:41:51,216
(Robert)
That <i>is </i>America for you.
That's America.

00:41:51,283 --> 00:41:52,885
Just watched a guy
go from zero to a millionaire

00:41:52,951 --> 00:41:53,952
in the shark tank.

00:41:54,019 --> 00:41:55,087
(sighs)
(Lori) Right.

00:41:55,154 --> 00:41:56,588
(mark) Congrats.
Let's rock, Lori.

00:41:56,655 --> 00:41:57,623
We're gonna rock.

00:41:57,689 --> 00:41:59,224
Thanks, guys.

00:41:59,291 --> 00:42:01,226
Wow.
Look at that.

00:42:01,293 --> 00:42:02,361
Whoo-hoo!

00:42:02,428 --> 00:42:04,630
This guy took $5,000

00:42:04,696 --> 00:42:07,166
and made it a million-dollar
idea in less than six months.

00:42:07,232 --> 00:42:09,601
Have you ever done <i>anything</i>
with eyeglasses?

00:42:09,668 --> 00:42:10,702
Actually, I've sold

00:42:10,769 --> 00:42:12,771
over $20 million worth
of reading glasses.

00:42:12,838 --> 00:42:14,006
So you can
just bundle this...

00:42:14,072 --> 00:42:16,275
so I can just bundle this
with some readers.

00:42:16,341 --> 00:42:19,511
As soon as he walked in here,
you knew that. We had no chance.

00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:22,448
(laughs)
Mark, can we switch seats?

00:42:22,514 --> 00:42:26,952
35% of my company is--is not
what I wanted to be left with,

00:42:27,019 --> 00:42:29,088
but when Lori looked
right into my eyes

00:42:29,154 --> 00:42:32,124
and said, "I'm gonna
make you a millionaire,"

00:42:32,191 --> 00:42:35,160
I believed her.
