00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,318
You're here not to sell us
on this,

00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:34,388
but to sell us on a $200 model,
but we don't see it?

00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,191
Well, that's why I'm here.
I'm going to show you--it's--

00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,992
but there's no prototype.

00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:39,993
It's not going to be
much different.

00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,228
See, the thing about
this is--

00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:43,263
why wouldn't it be, at half
the price, much different?

00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:46,099
We can use less costly materials
to make that.

00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,335
It's going to be smaller,
with shipping and boxing.

00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:51,138
But that explains
half the money difference?

00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:55,108
That doesn't make sense.
I love you, but I'm out.

00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:04,051
Tony, I don't really see
the market, at that price point,

00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:06,019
as a large consumer product.

00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:07,254
I'm out.

00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:12,125
I think it's a great idea,
but, literally, $500--

00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:14,194
I know a guy in the Hood
that will guarantee...

00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:15,295
(laughs)
To come to your house

00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:17,331
every day
for the rest of your life

00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:20,167

(sharks laughing)

00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:27,307
Okay. This is what
I need you to do, though.

00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:29,376
You guys are all getting
caught up in the $500.

00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:31,211
You're not l--you're not
listening to what I'm saying.

00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:34,081
I'm out.

00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:40,988
First of all, I think those are
the best-looking profenders

00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,122
I've ever seen.

00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,390
(laughs)
You've done a great job
with them,

00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:46,026
but for me, the biggest question
is size of market,

00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:49,196
and I think there's
a huge challenge, even at $200.

00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:52,199
As a business, I don't see it.
I'm out.

00:08:56,036 --> 00:09:00,174
Isn't the only guy on this panel
that you really need mark?

00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:06,280
Mark, you can't go out on me.
Listen, I'm gonna tell you why.

00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:09,917
This is Why. When I see you,
I see myself. I'm not lying.

00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:11,151
When I see you,
I see myself.

00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:14,221
You got a ton of money,
but money doesn't move you.

00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:16,356
What moves you is
the journey to get there,

00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:18,058
the push to get there.

00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,994
That's what I'm about.
I'm gonna get there.

00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,197
Mark, what are you
gonna do?

00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:28,302
You know I love you,

00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:29,303
everybody loves you, right?
Okay, listen,

00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:31,038
before you go out...
okay.

00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:32,239
'cause I hear
that going out...

00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:34,408
(exhales deeply)
This is what you have
to understand.

00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:39,313
With your help, it is going
to be on every driveway,

00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:43,150
in every backyard, and it's
gonna be in every gym.

00:09:43,217 --> 00:09:46,019
With my help,
it probably could be,

00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,423
and that's one
of the unfortunate scenarios.

00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:52,259
I don't have an unlimited number
of hours in the day.

00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:54,061
I'd have to be able to call
the head coaches.

00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:56,096
I'd have to be able to call
the athletic Directors.

00:09:56,163 --> 00:10:00,033
Time is the most precious asset
that I have,

00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,403
and unfortunately,
I don't see the reward.

00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,472
For that reason, I'm out.

00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:13,080
So Everybody's out?

00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:16,383
All right, guys.
Dev, let's roll, son.

00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:22,155
Absolutely I'm disappointed,
but just like I tell my son,

00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:24,224
it's not whether you win
or lose.

00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,226
It's, did you leave
everything you had

00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:29,196

costs you to make that product

00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:37,010
and what you sell it for?
An average cost--

00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:39,012

on each product is 600%.

incredible,

but also, as I said,
we're gonna hit up, uh,

00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,870
over a hundred accounts.
In those two years,

00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:05,005
we did the math.
That's 7.3 Days.

00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:07,774
Basically, if each of us can
close one account a month...
that's one account.

00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:09,943
Look, let me--let me
give you some reality.

00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,044
You've had a year.

00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:14,748
You've only sold
$30,000 worth in that year.

00:15:14,815 --> 00:15:16,783
Why haven't you sold
those hundred businesses?

00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:17,985
Why next year instead
of this year?

00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:20,053
We just don't have the capital
to actually manufacture.

00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,891
We need $75,000 just to produce
the product. That's all--

00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:26,760
but have you gone to a bank
at all? Have you tried--

00:15:26,827 --> 00:15:28,729
Yes.
Do you guys have
credit cards?

00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:29,763
We've gone to a bank
for personal credit cards.

00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:30,931
We've been turned down.

00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:33,033
(Kevin) No bank is gonna lend
these guys any money.

00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,002
That's why they're in
the shark tank.

00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:37,638
Exactly, but nobody's getting
money in this depressed economy.

00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:40,841
What is the most brutally
competitive industry on earth?

00:15:40,908 --> 00:15:42,776
Cosmetics. Do you know why?

00:15:42,843 --> 00:15:45,045
There's only one other guy
that has better margins,

00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:47,714
and that's a drug dealer,
all right?
(chuckles)

00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:48,916
You've got to get this brand
out there.

00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:52,019
You need millions of dollars.
How is that gonna happen?

00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:54,821
That $4.8 million in sales is
a hundred accounts in 2 years.

00:15:54,888 --> 00:15:56,123
That's one brother a month
landing an account.

00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,991
Kyle, you keep--you know what?
You keep saying...
very Achievable.

00:15:58,058 --> 00:15:59,893
"A hundred accounts.
A hundred accounts."

00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,698
How many businesses you think go
from $30,000 to $4.8 million?

00:16:04,765 --> 00:16:06,066
So let me ask

00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:07,835
the--the zillion-dollar
question.

00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:10,804
How much do you have
in unfilled orders?

00:16:10,871 --> 00:16:12,906
Uh, a few thousand Dollars.
$6,000.

00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:14,641
Oh, man, Kyle.
Okay, listen,

00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:15,943
that's a bad number.
Because they will not land

00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:17,744
until we can perform.

00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,746
If we don't have the product,
they won't come through with us.

00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:23,650
If this c--if this product
was so phenomenal

00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:25,719
that everybody was
demanding it

00:16:25,786 --> 00:16:26,854
and it was flying off
the shelves,

00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,089
someone would reach
into their pocket.

00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:30,824
I'm out.

00:16:35,863 --> 00:16:37,064
What's that?

00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,765
(Kyle) These are
testimonials from people

00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:39,900
who have experienced
our product.

00:16:39,967 --> 00:16:42,903
This is a-a letter

thanked us
for a wonderful product.

00:16:46,907 --> 00:16:48,075
Let me see that.

00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:49,710

"We hope you will continue

Thank you again
for your kind gift."

00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:00,921
(Robert) What does that mean?
This isn't--

00:17:00,988 --> 00:17:02,055
"Please send $2,000
for my reelection."

00:17:02,122 --> 00:17:03,957
(mark laughs) Yeah. Exactly.

00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:05,759
This is totally generic, guys.
(Barbara) Absolutely.

00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:06,760
Well, guys, let me--
let me just--
it means they're polite.

00:17:06,827 --> 00:17:07,895
Let me just say something.

00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:10,097
Uh, I believe in your story
as the four individuals,

00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:13,100
because when I started, it was
myself and three other guys.

00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,135
The beauty of it was,
at any given time,

00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:18,705
four of us was someplace doing
something for the company,

00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:21,141
and I think that that
was the basis to my success.

00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,810
But, you know, I think
it's a little too early, uh,

00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:27,080
so with that being said,
I'm out.

00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:31,051
I'd like to tell you
what I don't like

00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:32,753
about your business.
(Kyle) Sure.

00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:34,955
Your projection
of $4.8 million in sales

00:17:35,022 --> 00:17:36,924
with no justification,
really, on how

00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,026
you could possibly get there,
really makes us

00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:42,663
have to be almost a little
foolish to believe.
I respect that.

00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,032
The other is, I don't like
your name, "Nardo,"

00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:46,667
to be honest with you.

00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:47,701
Well--
(Barbara)
Is that your last name?

00:17:47,768 --> 00:17:48,769
No, our full last name
is Mastronardo.

00:17:48,836 --> 00:17:49,870
That's even worse.

00:17:49,937 --> 00:17:51,972
(men laugh)
No, you know, there's--

00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:53,807
something about "Nardo" Sounds--
Yeah, that is bad.

00:17:53,874 --> 00:17:55,642
It goes--uh, forgive me,
but it's not your real name,

00:17:55,709 --> 00:17:56,944
so I don't feel bad
telling you.

00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:00,047
And last, you know what I love?
Your stupid naivete.

00:18:05,886 --> 00:18:08,889

I'm gonna make an offer.

All right, Buddy.
Let's do this.

00:22:06,734 --> 00:22:09,704
We've been cooking all night.
Really, really excited

00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:12,306
to have
our family and friends here.

00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:14,775

Before we got a deal
with Barbara,

00:22:34,595 --> 00:22:36,631
we were running this company
out of my basement.

00:22:36,697 --> 00:22:38,633
Now our sauces are carried
nationwide

00:22:38,699 --> 00:22:41,402

It's been, you know, a meteoric
rise for pork barrel bbq,

00:22:50,678 --> 00:22:53,548
and it's all thanks to Barbara
making a deal with us.

00:22:53,614 --> 00:22:55,550
These were
two obnoxious little attorneys

With a dream...
(chuckles)

00:22:57,618 --> 00:23:01,389
and they took
my little $50,000 investment,

00:23:01,455 --> 00:23:04,358
and they turned it into
a hugely successful business.

We're in over 2,000 stores

Has this ever happened

you've hired a kid from down

is the focus of their day,

00:24:18,532 --> 00:24:20,301

Well, we've been in business
since late last year.

00:25:23,431 --> 00:25:25,366
We have about 50 grandmas
in Los Angeles.

00:25:25,433 --> 00:25:26,400
(chuckles)

00:25:26,467 --> 00:25:27,501

It's been
pretty overwhelming.

00:25:37,211 --> 00:25:38,579

00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:52,193
Our sales so far this year
have been about $25,000,

00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,528
but we just had all
our disclosure documents done

00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:55,529
for the franchises.

00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:57,164
What does a granny get paid?

00:25:57,231 --> 00:25:58,366
What's a granny going for
these days?

00:25:58,432 --> 00:25:59,533
It depends what
they're gonna do.

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,335
I'd say, here in Los Angeles,
it's about...

00:26:01,402 --> 00:26:03,537
anywhere from $14 to $20.

00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,239
Other cities
it might be a little lower.

00:26:05,306 --> 00:26:07,241
But what are babysitters
charging, so I can compare?

00:26:07,308 --> 00:26:09,410
Oh, okay. Babysitters are
usually getting

00:26:09,477 --> 00:26:12,213
anywhere from, like,
$10 to $13.

00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,548
So grannies are
more expensive?

00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:16,551
Yeah, but you're getting
decades of experience.

00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:18,419
Most of them are
actual grandmas.

00:26:18,486 --> 00:26:20,354
They know how to handle
situations.

00:26:20,421 --> 00:26:22,189
They're really wonderful
with the kids.

00:26:22,256 --> 00:26:25,326
So how can I make a buck off
of granny? How does this work?

00:26:25,393 --> 00:26:28,529
Our clients sign
a placement agreement with us,

00:26:28,596 --> 00:26:30,264
and we're getting a fee
up-front.

00:26:30,331 --> 00:26:32,400
We charge
between 12% and 15%

00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:35,403
of what the granny's
gonna get paid.

00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:39,373
So you're saying We're only
getting 15% of Granny's take?

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,609
Uh, Well, yeah, but you're
being paid up-front

00:26:41,676 --> 00:26:43,277
for whether
it's six months or--

00:26:43,344 --> 00:26:44,445
you know, I gotta tell you
something, Todd.

00:26:44,512 --> 00:26:46,314
That sounds, like, really thin.

00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,115
You're actually acquiring
the customer,

00:26:48,182 --> 00:26:49,417
and you're only making 15%.

00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:52,587
Well, in the industry,
it's usually about 12% to 15%,

00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:55,122
and don't forget,
once they're placed,

00:26:55,189 --> 00:26:56,324
we're really not doing
a lot.

00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,593
The response has
just been--

00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:00,528
we have literally,
in the last two months,

00:27:00,595 --> 00:27:03,497
got in over 400 requests
for franchise information.

00:27:03,564 --> 00:27:04,498
But Why would anybody
franchise something

00:27:04,565 --> 00:27:05,566
with only $25,000 in sales?

00:27:05,633 --> 00:27:08,302
That doesn't make sense
to me, Todd.

00:27:08,369 --> 00:27:11,138
What value do you bring?
There's no brand rent-a-granny.

00:27:11,205 --> 00:27:12,506
I've never heard of this
before.

00:27:12,573 --> 00:27:15,276
We're trademarked, and that's
'cause we're brand-New.

00:27:16,544 --> 00:27:18,379
Well, now let's just punch
some numbers, Todd.

00:27:18,446 --> 00:27:21,182
Average Babysitting session--
five hours.

00:27:21,249 --> 00:27:24,619
Top-in Grannie--20 Bucks.
Get $100.

00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:29,223
My Vig's 15%.
I make 15 bucks off of granny.

00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:32,293
That's not enough.
I gotta squeeze granny big-time.

00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,462
I need more dough.
Right, and that's exactly
what I was gonna say.

00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,397
We're--our placements
are usually

00:27:36,464 --> 00:27:37,565
6 to 12 Months or longer...

00:27:37,632 --> 00:27:39,600
so we're charging
for the year,

00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:41,335
and there's a minimum,
so our--

00:27:41,402 --> 00:27:43,304
Todd, the margin on granny
sucks.
Whoa. Wait, wait, wait.

00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:44,305
Kevin, let him finish.
Kevin, Kevin, Kevin.
15 bucks a day. He's--he's--

00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:45,573
yeah, but let me tell you,
Kevin,

00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,608
we're getting paid a minimum
up-front,

00:27:47,675 --> 00:27:49,410
so it's not just
the $10 a day.

00:27:49,477 --> 00:27:53,214
You're getting $1,200 to $2,400
from the, uh, client that's--

00:27:53,281 --> 00:27:54,248
that's hiring the Granny.
Right.

00:27:54,315 --> 00:27:56,350
Todd, what is
your minimum commitment

00:27:56,417 --> 00:27:58,152
from the client?

00:27:58,219 --> 00:28:00,588
If it's a temporary,
which means 90 DAYS or less,

00:28:00,655 --> 00:28:03,357
we're usually gonna get
at least $1,200.

00:28:03,424 --> 00:28:04,458
What happens
if the granny quits

00:28:04,525 --> 00:28:06,460
or dies halfway
through the assignment?

00:28:06,527 --> 00:28:07,461
(laughs)

00:28:07,528 --> 00:28:08,496
Okay,
in our placement agreement,

00:28:08,563 --> 00:28:11,165
we have
a replacement guarantee.

00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:15,303
We will, uh, replace them
with up to three grandmas,

00:28:15,369 --> 00:28:17,238
so if someone doesn't work out
for some reason...

00:28:17,305 --> 00:28:18,506
(laughs)
(chuckles) Granny dies,

00:28:18,573 --> 00:28:20,207

if granny drops dead...

00:28:20,274 --> 00:28:21,409

like the family pet?
Or the kids--

00:28:21,475 --> 00:28:23,444

in the trunk...
(sharks laughing)

00:28:23,511 --> 00:28:25,313
"Myrtle, put your wig on.

We're gonna--

00:28:25,379 --> 00:28:26,547
we're gonna send out
three more women--

00:28:26,614 --> 00:28:29,116
you don't need to finish that,

00:28:29,183 --> 00:28:31,519

00:28:31,586 --> 00:28:35,256
Okay, but, uh, you know,

00:28:35,323 --> 00:28:37,525
look, Todd.
You're doing $25,000.

00:28:37,592 --> 00:28:40,294
You're a long way away
from franchising.

00:28:40,361 --> 00:28:41,562
I'm out.

00:28:43,231 --> 00:28:46,200
Todd, I think you have
a, uh, a smart name.

00:28:46,267 --> 00:28:47,501
I love the name.

00:28:47,568 --> 00:28:49,470
Thank you, and that's
trademarked, by the way.
Really clever,

00:28:49,537 --> 00:28:53,107
but I have to say, this just
isn't my type of business.

00:28:53,174 --> 00:28:54,275

00:28:54,342 --> 00:28:56,644
Okay.

00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,415
I just don't like
the numbers, Todd.

00:29:01,482 --> 00:29:03,551
If you came back
and said to me,

00:29:03,618 --> 00:29:05,620
"look, I can get granny
for 50 cents on the dollar,"

00:29:05,686 --> 00:29:07,355
now you're talking.
(chuckles)

00:29:07,421 --> 00:29:10,191
then I'd be interested,
but you're not, so I'm out.

00:29:12,193 --> 00:29:14,595
I think you have a good idea.
I actually like it.

00:29:14,662 --> 00:29:17,131
I think it's a brand
you can build,

00:29:17,198 --> 00:29:18,366

very difficult to scale...

00:29:18,432 --> 00:29:19,533
(chuckles) and honestly

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,303
I don't want to be in
the rent-a-grandma business,

00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:25,406
um, so I'm out.

00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:28,476
Okay. Thank you, gentlemen.
Good luck, Todd.

00:29:28,543 --> 00:29:29,477
Thank you.
Good luck.

00:29:29,544 --> 00:29:31,612
Appreciate it.
All the best.

Unless you franchise this
very, very quickly...

00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,155
but I don't want to be
that early,

00:29:41,222 --> 00:29:42,323

a lot of work.

I'm Rachael Mann,
and this is my sister

00:29:58,139 --> 00:30:00,207
and business partner
Mackenzie Burdick...

00:30:00,274 --> 00:30:02,176
and We're the creators
of litter jewelry

00:30:02,243 --> 00:30:04,078
in San Francisco, california.

00:30:04,145 --> 00:30:07,515
Growing up, we were always
creating and designing together.

00:30:07,582 --> 00:30:09,417
We were always
really into fashion.

00:30:09,483 --> 00:30:11,118
Maybe out
of different materials?

00:30:11,185 --> 00:30:12,320
I studied interior design,

00:30:12,386 --> 00:30:14,088
and Mackenzie studied
fashion design.

00:30:14,155 --> 00:30:16,190
You know, we've always
just been creators.

00:30:16,257 --> 00:30:18,326
Creating is just in our blood.
It's what we love to do.

00:30:18,392 --> 00:30:19,327
(Mackenzie)
Making custom Jewelry

00:30:19,393 --> 00:30:21,329
just kind of fell
into our laps.

00:30:21,395 --> 00:30:23,297
I really wanted to create
a unique piece of jewelry

00:30:23,364 --> 00:30:26,334
that would really make me
stand out for a special event,

00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,236
and so I broke up
a necklace

00:30:28,302 --> 00:30:30,137
and wore it in my hair
as a headpiece,

00:30:30,204 --> 00:30:32,106
and the response was
unbelievable.

00:30:32,173 --> 00:30:34,108
So we made 50 more,
and we entered them

00:30:34,175 --> 00:30:36,410
in a trunk show here
in San Francisco

00:30:36,477 --> 00:30:38,479
and sold out of
every single one of them.

00:30:38,546 --> 00:30:41,115
And that's
when litter began.

00:30:41,182 --> 00:30:43,384
We take vintage chain

00:30:43,451 --> 00:30:45,152
and broken pieces
of costume jewelry,

00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:48,222
and we make pieces
of body jewelry.

00:30:48,289 --> 00:30:49,457
Our entire business is
just the two of us,

00:30:49,523 --> 00:30:52,126
and we are working
around the clock...

00:30:52,193 --> 00:30:54,362
pouring the resins,
sourcing the materials,

00:30:54,428 --> 00:30:57,531

Mackenzie's got
a New baby coming.

00:30:59,367 --> 00:31:02,136

all of this.

That's why we need
the sharks.

00:31:05,306 --> 00:31:07,508
We need somebody who can focus
on the business side,

00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:09,577
so that we can get
back into the creative area

00:31:09,644 --> 00:31:12,146
and making new Collections.

00:31:12,213 --> 00:31:13,381
We really want to be able
to capitalize

00:31:13,447 --> 00:31:15,550

Hi, sharks. I'm Mackenzie,

and we're litter.

00:31:43,177 --> 00:31:46,480
We're san Francisco-based
jewelry and accessory designers.

00:31:46,547 --> 00:31:48,182
We're here today seeking
$80,000

00:31:48,249 --> 00:31:51,285
in exchange for a 51% stake
in our company.

00:31:51,352 --> 00:31:54,422
Litter was started in 2009
when I broke up a necklace

00:31:54,488 --> 00:31:56,390
and wore it in my hair
as a headpiece.

00:31:56,457 --> 00:31:58,092
We were approached
by a friend

00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:59,327
to make many more
of those headpieces

00:31:59,393 --> 00:32:02,129
and sell them
in a local jewelry Show.

00:32:02,196 --> 00:32:03,497
Rachael and I went around
to all the flea markets,

00:32:03,564 --> 00:32:05,399
vintage stores,
Thrift stores in our area

00:32:05,466 --> 00:32:07,401
and collected up chain.

00:32:07,468 --> 00:32:11,405
We made 50 headpieces
and sold out at 150 bucks a pop.

00:32:11,472 --> 00:32:14,108
With the money from the show,
we got a studio,

00:32:14,175 --> 00:32:16,177
some materials,
and launched our web site.

00:32:16,244 --> 00:32:18,179
Right away,
our designs were in demand,

00:32:18,246 --> 00:32:22,383
and by 2010, we were selling
wholesale to retailers globally.

00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:25,086
So we make headpieces,
ear cuffs,

00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:26,487
jewelry that goes down
your legs,

00:32:26,554 --> 00:32:28,322
which is just so sexy,

00:32:28,389 --> 00:32:32,126
shoe jewelry, which can totally
transform the look of any shoe,

00:32:32,193 --> 00:32:36,230
arm jewelry,
hands, which are awesome,

00:32:36,297 --> 00:32:39,367
and we even make
chain mustaches.

people at festivals,
music festivals--

00:32:46,307 --> 00:32:48,509
they absolutely love them,
so...

00:32:48,576 --> 00:32:50,077
our designs have
been featured

00:32:50,144 --> 00:32:51,479
in all of
the top fashion magazines.

00:32:51,546 --> 00:32:53,281
We've been worn by celebrities,

00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:56,150
and all of this exposure
we got without one single dollar

00:32:56,217 --> 00:32:59,220
being spent
on any advertising or P.R.,

00:32:59,287 --> 00:33:01,155
and so we think
this is a perfect example

00:33:01,222 --> 00:33:03,157
of how much bigger Litter
would get

00:33:03,224 --> 00:33:05,159
if we had more TEAM members
managing our growth

00:33:05,226 --> 00:33:07,495
and focusing
on aggressive sales.

00:33:07,562 --> 00:33:10,565
How big is litter now?
What were sales last year?

00:33:10,631 --> 00:33:12,066
What are they gonna be
this year?

00:33:12,133 --> 00:33:13,367
Last year our sales were
$78,000,

00:33:13,434 --> 00:33:16,203
and this year We're on track
for $150,000.

00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:19,507
Why are sales so small?
I mean, this stuff is unique.

00:33:19,574 --> 00:33:24,178
I haven't ever seen it before,
but only $150,000?

00:33:24,245 --> 00:33:26,247
We're handmaking every single
piece ourselves right now,

00:33:26,314 --> 00:33:27,248
and we just--
so how--

00:33:27,315 --> 00:33:28,482
how much does
a typical piece cost,

00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:30,484
and what's
your most expensive piece?

00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:33,321
$100.
The average price is $100,
around $100.

00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:35,256
And then what does it cost
you to make one?

00:33:35,323 --> 00:33:36,324
About $2.

00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:40,127
I have never seen a piece
like that.

00:33:40,194 --> 00:33:42,230
This one?
That's, like, basically,
uh, chain mail,

00:33:42,296 --> 00:33:44,498
for argument's sake.
Well, this--this piece
We're really proud of. We--

00:33:44,565 --> 00:33:47,201
this took us a few hours
to make,

00:33:47,268 --> 00:33:49,103
$20 in material,
and we just sold it

00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:51,272
at a gallery for $1,600.

00:33:51,339 --> 00:33:53,074
$1,600?
$1,600.

00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,142
This is an example
of the kind of custom work

00:33:55,209 --> 00:33:57,144
that we do for celebrities,
music videos.

00:33:57,211 --> 00:33:58,145
Yeah.
We've been pulled

00:33:58,212 --> 00:34:00,181
for, like, ke$ha, Ciara,
lady gaga,

00:34:00,248 --> 00:34:01,515
and so that's like a--
what--do you have now--

00:34:01,582 --> 00:34:03,251
I'm just trying
to understand this.

00:34:03,317 --> 00:34:05,319
Do you have pending orders
that...

00:34:05,386 --> 00:34:07,088
(Rachael) We do.
You can't keep up with?

00:34:07,154 --> 00:34:11,158
Well, we just got picked up
by urban outfitters, and, um...

00:34:11,225 --> 00:34:12,226
mm-hmm.

00:34:12,293 --> 00:34:13,294
(Robert chuckles)
They are having us design

00:34:13,361 --> 00:34:16,163
an EXCLUSIVE collection
for them.

00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,232
And is there a minimum order,
Rachael, with them?

00:34:18,299 --> 00:34:20,501
Are they guaranteeing
a certain order quantity?

00:34:20,568 --> 00:34:23,204
Right now, it's a 400-piece
order and it's growing each...
Yeah, we have a 400-piece P.O.

00:34:23,271 --> 00:34:25,206
And so it's gonna be a set?
And they're gonna see how
it goes, if it sells through?

00:34:25,273 --> 00:34:27,074
(Rachael and Mackenzie)
Yes, exactly.
And go from there.

00:34:27,141 --> 00:34:28,276
And you guys are making
everything by hand?
Everything.

00:34:28,342 --> 00:34:29,477
That's craziness, right?

00:34:29,544 --> 00:34:30,545
Everything.
Every piece by Hand.

00:34:30,611 --> 00:34:32,280
So can somebody else
make these

00:34:32,346 --> 00:34:34,115
or does it require that special
touch that you guys have?

00:34:34,181 --> 00:34:35,283
Other people can make them.

00:34:35,349 --> 00:34:37,552
Nope, the designs are set by us,
and then from there,

00:34:37,618 --> 00:34:39,253
other people can
take it from there.

00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,155
I'm trying to figure out
how to ramp this up.

00:34:41,222 --> 00:34:44,125
'cause, I mean, it's hip,
it's--it's fashion.

00:34:44,191 --> 00:34:45,226
You're the designer babes.

00:34:45,293 --> 00:34:47,428
You need somebody behind you
or in front of you

00:34:47,495 --> 00:34:49,163
that's selling this...
(Rachael) Absolutely.

00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,398
And getting huge orders.

00:34:50,464 --> 00:34:52,133
We would like the money
to go towards

00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:54,435
hiring a great salesperson
and then maybe getting us

00:34:54,502 --> 00:34:56,370
a great P.R. Agency that just
constantly is pushing us.

00:34:56,437 --> 00:34:58,406
But--but wait a second. You've
done all this without any P.R.

00:34:58,472 --> 00:35:00,374
I like that model.

00:35:00,441 --> 00:35:02,376
Yeah, but think how much bigger
it could get.
Get back to manufacturing.

00:35:02,443 --> 00:35:06,314
If I send one piece over to--
to a manufacturer,

00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:09,350
is there any reason he can't
pound out 10,000 of them?

00:35:09,417 --> 00:35:11,219
No.
There's no reason.

00:35:13,187 --> 00:35:15,122
So you wanna work for somebody.

00:35:15,189 --> 00:35:16,224
We're just looking for
the right partner

00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:17,425
that knows what they're doing.
Yeah.

00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:19,560
We just need to know the next
steps to take, you know?

00:35:19,627 --> 00:35:22,563
It's just gotten bigger than us.
You guys are designers. That's
your special sauce, right?

00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,498
Yeah, that really is
our special sauce.
And you guys wanna design.

00:35:24,565 --> 00:35:26,267
Exactly.
And anything else that you do
takes your time away

00:35:26,334 --> 00:35:27,368
from Designing.
Exactly.

00:35:27,435 --> 00:35:29,470
So you want someone
to come in and say,

00:35:29,537 --> 00:35:31,472
"guys, you do what you do,
right?

00:35:31,539 --> 00:35:33,407
We'll take over the rest."

00:35:33,474 --> 00:35:34,575
(Rachael and Mackenzie) Mm-hmm.

00:35:34,642 --> 00:35:37,111
The challenge is--
here's kind of the catch-22.

00:35:37,178 --> 00:35:39,447
We can't just come in
and work full-time, right?
No. Exactly. Exactly.

00:35:39,513 --> 00:35:40,514
So you have to hire somebody
to come in and work full-time.

00:35:40,581 --> 00:35:42,116
We understand,
mm-hmm.

00:35:42,183 --> 00:35:43,184
Tell us how you would spend
the $80,000.

00:35:43,251 --> 00:35:44,452
What--what do you have
envisioned?

00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:47,388
I would like to hire a really
great salesperson initially,

00:35:47,455 --> 00:35:49,190
and then also just ramp up
our web site.

00:35:49,257 --> 00:35:51,192
Our web site could be
1,000% better.

00:35:51,259 --> 00:35:53,427
Be able to handle
high--higher Volume.
Yeah.

00:35:53,494 --> 00:35:55,096
Again, we all know

00:35:55,162 --> 00:35:57,131
it's gonna take
more than $80,000 long run,

00:35:57,198 --> 00:35:59,100
but initially, we think
that would be a good start.

00:35:59,166 --> 00:36:01,202
You guys are walking proof of
concept. That's what happened.

00:36:01,269 --> 00:36:04,105
You sold just enough
to make it interesting...

00:36:04,171 --> 00:36:06,274
(Robert) right.
But not enough
to say it's a business.

00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,341
Right.

00:36:07,408 --> 00:36:10,077
I mean, it is so
on the tipping point

00:36:10,144 --> 00:36:14,115
because you should be getting
$150,000 orders from somebody,

00:36:14,181 --> 00:36:15,316
not $150,000 a year.

00:36:15,383 --> 00:36:16,517
We need somebody
that is in sales

00:36:16,584 --> 00:36:19,353
that has those department store
connections and web site--

00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:22,156
I don't--I don't--I don't know
what to do with you guys.

00:36:22,223 --> 00:36:23,324
I mean, I-I can give you money,

00:36:23,391 --> 00:36:26,260
but I don't want to work
at your shop.

00:36:26,327 --> 00:36:28,162
Yeah, I understand.
I want you to bring me
a package that says,

00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:31,265
if you give me $180,000,
$250,000,

00:36:31,332 --> 00:36:33,501
I can turn this into
a $10 million business.

00:36:33,568 --> 00:36:35,102
Here's my plan.

00:36:35,169 --> 00:36:36,170
Right.
If you told me that,

00:36:36,237 --> 00:36:38,105
I'd probably
be very, very interested.

00:36:38,172 --> 00:36:40,207
Because I like the stuff...
mm-hmm.

00:36:40,274 --> 00:36:42,276
I like the story,
and I like you guys.

00:36:42,343 --> 00:36:44,212
And I don't say that
very Often.

00:36:44,278 --> 00:36:45,279
Can--
(chuckles) Thank you.

00:36:45,346 --> 00:36:46,447
I should be beating you
with stick

00:36:46,514 --> 00:36:47,481
for making the mistake
you've made.

00:36:47,548 --> 00:36:50,251
But with your money,
we could be able to

00:36:50,318 --> 00:36:53,354
spend less time hand-making each
piece and being able to fill--

00:36:53,421 --> 00:36:55,256
no, I don't want you to
hand-make anything. I want you

00:36:55,323 --> 00:36:58,125
to get somebody in China
to make 10,000 copies of it.

00:36:58,192 --> 00:37:00,361
Exactly.
I-I don't have the passion
for the jewelry business...

00:37:00,428 --> 00:37:02,463
(Rachael) Okay.
And I have a full-time job.

00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:05,199
I-I-I can't help you find
that person.

00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:06,367
I'm out.

00:37:06,434 --> 00:37:09,170
All right.

00:37:09,237 --> 00:37:11,305
What's the most popular piece
there

00:37:11,372 --> 00:37:12,506
that sells the most?

00:37:12,573 --> 00:37:15,076
Our leg chains
are really popular.

00:37:15,142 --> 00:37:16,177
Mm-hmm.
Um, yeah.

00:37:16,244 --> 00:37:17,245
What about that?

00:37:17,311 --> 00:37:18,379
Is there another one
of a leg chain like that?

00:37:18,446 --> 00:37:20,414
Yeah, this is called
a slim garter.

00:37:20,481 --> 00:37:22,250
How much
does that sell for?

00:37:22,316 --> 00:37:23,384
$120.

00:37:23,451 --> 00:37:25,219
I'll take that. All right?

00:37:25,286 --> 00:37:27,255
Do you have it in his size?

00:37:27,321 --> 00:37:29,257
(Kevin) I want that
right off your leg.
What about the beard?

00:37:29,323 --> 00:37:31,459
Can I see one of the beards?
I'd love to.
(Rachael) Yes, of course.

00:37:31,525 --> 00:37:34,128
So you might have to, uh,
put these on.

00:37:34,195 --> 00:37:35,296
Does that work?

00:37:35,363 --> 00:37:36,364
As you put it on,
you have to kind of adjust it.

00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,431
(laughs)

00:37:37,498 --> 00:37:39,100
(Kevin) He can go incognito
tonight.

00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:41,202
(laughter)

00:37:41,269 --> 00:37:42,536
That is so perfect for Kevin.

00:37:42,603 --> 00:37:45,106
You're putting it
on the wrong guy.

00:37:45,172 --> 00:37:47,508
That is cool.
(Robert)
daymond, what are you doing?

00:37:47,575 --> 00:37:51,212
Well, you...

00:37:51,279 --> 00:37:53,247
okay, so here's the deal.

00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:55,550
This is basically
what we call in Our business

00:37:55,616 --> 00:37:57,451
a designer offer.

00:37:57,518 --> 00:38:01,355
And the designers normally,
the top end of a deal

00:38:01,422 --> 00:38:03,424
is they get 35%

00:38:03,491 --> 00:38:05,426
because they're
just designers.

00:38:05,493 --> 00:38:10,231
Now I will give you
the $80,000...

00:38:12,533 --> 00:38:14,435
for 70%.

00:38:16,604 --> 00:38:18,205
(Barbara) 70%?

00:38:18,272 --> 00:38:21,242
But what if we're willing
to do the work? Like...

00:38:21,309 --> 00:38:23,411
then I will let you
buy back in

00:38:23,477 --> 00:38:27,548
to acquire what
you initially asked for.

00:38:27,615 --> 00:38:31,352
$80,000 for 70%. Wow.

00:38:31,419 --> 00:38:33,187
(Kevin)
it doesn't make any money.

00:38:33,254 --> 00:38:34,422
(Barbara)
You know, daymond, you w--
(daymond) it does make money.

00:38:34,488 --> 00:38:37,458
You would never make that offer
to a male designer. No way.

00:38:37,525 --> 00:38:39,126
Ohh. No, come on.
Oh, here comes her crap.

00:38:39,193 --> 00:38:41,329
Whoa! B-Barb...
say what you want.

00:38:41,395 --> 00:38:42,530
Look, guys--guys, here's part
of the challenge.
It's the truth.

00:38:42,597 --> 00:38:44,298
And I'm gonna
sell myself here.

00:38:44,365 --> 00:38:45,466
Part of this challenge is,

00:38:45,533 --> 00:38:47,468
now you still have to figure out
how to pay yourselves.

00:38:47,535 --> 00:38:50,271
No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

00:38:50,338 --> 00:38:53,507
So it's $80,000
for 70% of your company.

00:38:53,574 --> 00:38:56,577
But you will also
get salaries as well.

00:38:56,644 --> 00:38:59,413
So you'll have salaries
and you'll have profit.

00:39:02,216 --> 00:39:04,151
Well, you better ask
about the salary, girls.

00:39:04,218 --> 00:39:05,486
(Rachael and Mackenzie) Yeah.

00:39:05,553 --> 00:39:08,222
It better be a lot to make up
for what he's taking from you.

00:39:08,289 --> 00:39:10,157
We would have to agree on it.

00:39:10,224 --> 00:39:11,325
I mean, I would think--
what's a typical designer make,
daymond?

00:39:11,392 --> 00:39:12,560
What kind of salary
are you willing to pay us?

00:39:12,627 --> 00:39:14,262
It all depends
on--on the business.

00:39:14,328 --> 00:39:17,465
A typical designer ranges
from $50,000 to $250,000.

00:39:17,531 --> 00:39:19,400
(Robert) That's a big range.
Exactly.

00:39:19,467 --> 00:39:21,235
We wanna be on the higher end.
Yeah, no kidding, right?

00:39:21,302 --> 00:39:23,237
It all depends
on the designer.

00:39:23,304 --> 00:39:24,405
I think that's all
in the details,

00:39:24,472 --> 00:39:27,241
but right now,
what I'm willing to is

00:39:27,308 --> 00:39:30,545
$80,000 for 70%.,

00:39:30,611 --> 00:39:32,146
make you guys
the head designers.

00:39:32,213 --> 00:39:35,216
If you want and you feel
you can run the company,

00:39:35,283 --> 00:39:37,485
I'll go right back down
to the 51%.

00:39:39,453 --> 00:39:42,223
Don't till you know
you have other offers coming.

00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:44,258
But unfortunately, if you
entertain the other offers,

00:39:44,325 --> 00:39:45,259
I'm gonna pull back.

00:39:45,326 --> 00:39:46,394
Whoo.

00:39:50,264 --> 00:39:53,134
♪♪♪

00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:57,104
♪♪♪

00:39:57,171 --> 00:39:59,941
<i>One shark is out.</i>

00:40:00,007 --> 00:40:03,911
<i>Daymond has made an offer</i>
<i>of $80,000 for a 70% stake</i>

00:40:03,978 --> 00:40:06,814
<i>and an annual salary</i>
<i>for Rachael and Mackenzie.</i>

00:40:06,881 --> 00:40:09,083

00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:12,753

00:40:13,988 --> 00:40:15,723
Whoo.

00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:16,958
(mark) Let me talk to this guy.
Daymond, what if we did this?

00:40:17,024 --> 00:40:19,860
$40,000 each. I'll deal with
the Web site side of it.

00:40:19,927 --> 00:40:21,796
I don't think
you've nailed down a salary.

00:40:21,862 --> 00:40:23,764
That's a broad range
of Salaries.

00:40:23,831 --> 00:40:25,066
Barbara, what do you think?

00:40:25,132 --> 00:40:27,702
Rachael, Rachael, Rachael.
Mark just--
I can't get a word in.

00:40:27,768 --> 00:40:30,771
Mark just offered
to come in half with me,

00:40:30,838 --> 00:40:34,809
and he'll handle
the Web site side...
the Web site side.

00:40:34,875 --> 00:40:36,043
And the internet marketing.
And I'll handle
the manufacturing

00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,778
and the retail side.

00:40:37,845 --> 00:40:40,815
So his strength is
the retail, manufacturing.

00:40:40,882 --> 00:40:43,084
Mine is the internet--
internet marketing,

00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,719
social media.

00:40:44,785 --> 00:40:46,654
You'll get
the best of both worlds.

00:40:46,721 --> 00:40:49,023
By the way, I know the president
of urban outfitters,

00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:51,626
and I work with
the number one guy

00:40:51,692 --> 00:40:53,828
who provides 80%
of ll the jewelry...

00:40:53,895 --> 00:40:55,830
mm-hmm.
In America.

00:40:55,897 --> 00:40:57,965
(Barbara)
Rachael, come over here.
All right, just to
make things interesting.

00:40:58,032 --> 00:40:59,033
And to help you
'cause I love you guys,

00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,801
um, I'll just do
the deal you want.

00:41:00,868 --> 00:41:02,737
I'll give you the $80,000
for 51%, and I don't bring

00:41:02,803 --> 00:41:05,706
any of the expertise
in the jewelry business at all.
(laughs)

00:41:05,773 --> 00:41:08,809
the one thing you said
you needed.
And I admit that because
I'm honest about it.

00:41:08,876 --> 00:41:10,745
I'm a financial investor.

00:41:10,811 --> 00:41:12,947
But what connections are you
gonna put us in line with

00:41:13,014 --> 00:41:14,015
That are gonna help us?

00:41:14,081 --> 00:41:15,883
More money.

00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:19,720
I hate to do it, but I'm gonna
give you what mark usually does,

00:41:19,787 --> 00:41:22,657
is--what is it,
a 24-second clock?

00:41:22,723 --> 00:41:23,858
Oh, the 24-second clock?

00:41:23,925 --> 00:41:25,927
No, you're not gonna give it.
Hold on a moment, girls.

00:41:25,993 --> 00:41:27,929
(sharks all shouting at once)

00:41:27,995 --> 00:41:30,865
We've seen this routine before.
To clarify it, I'm giving you
a 24-second time clock.

00:41:30,932 --> 00:41:34,068
Rachael, listen to me.
Mark and I are coming in
at $80,000.

00:41:34,135 --> 00:41:37,772
Half and half. You will
also get salaries...

00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:39,707
let me tell you what
I'm going to give you.

00:41:39,774 --> 00:41:40,875
And he will handle internet,
and I will handle Retail.

00:41:40,942 --> 00:41:41,976
Please, he's gonna try
to close it down

00:41:42,043 --> 00:41:43,110
so you don't get a better bid.

00:41:43,177 --> 00:41:46,113
I'm gonna start your 24-second
time clock right now.

00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:49,050
Tell him to take a walk. I'll
bring him in after the fact.
For 70% of the company.

00:41:49,116 --> 00:41:50,651
Ay, yi yi.

00:41:50,718 --> 00:41:52,019
Yes.

00:41:52,086 --> 00:41:53,120
Thank you.
(laughs)

00:41:53,187 --> 00:41:56,090
Oh, my God.

00:41:56,157 --> 00:41:57,758
(laughs)
Congratulations.

00:41:57,825 --> 00:41:58,826
Thank you so much.
(Barbara) What?!

00:41:58,893 --> 00:41:59,927
(daymond) Congratulations.

00:41:59,994 --> 00:42:01,128
(Barbara)
I'm gonna kill you!

00:42:01,195 --> 00:42:02,763
(Rachael) Thank you, Barbara,
so much.

00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:04,899
Not on my watch, Barbara!

00:42:04,966 --> 00:42:07,034
(laughs)
What?!

00:42:07,101 --> 00:42:09,136
we love you, Barbara.
Seriously, we really love you.

00:42:09,203 --> 00:42:11,706
Too bad, girls.
(Rachael speaks indistinctly)

00:42:11,772 --> 00:42:12,873
(mark) Thank you, guys.
Congratulations.

00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,108
Thank you! Bye.

00:42:14,175 --> 00:42:16,110
It's like watching the lambs
go to the slaughterhouse.

00:42:16,177 --> 00:42:17,912
(mark) It's easy money.
Oh, my God.

00:42:17,979 --> 00:42:20,014
You were vague,
you gave them a lousy deal.

00:42:20,081 --> 00:42:21,682
Ay, yi yi.

00:42:21,749 --> 00:42:22,850
Ooh, ooh! Ooh, ooh!

00:42:22,917 --> 00:42:24,085
He's gonna wear that out.
That--that's all I need.

00:42:24,151 --> 00:42:25,786
(laughing)

00:42:25,853 --> 00:42:28,122
We went in there wanting to be
partners with Daymond and mark.

00:42:28,189 --> 00:42:29,857
I mean, those were
our two Favorites.

00:42:29,924 --> 00:42:32,026
Those were the ones we went for
and, gosh, we got it,

00:42:32,093 --> 00:42:34,128
and we're just feeling
amazing.
