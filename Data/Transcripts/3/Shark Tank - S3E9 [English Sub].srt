00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:55,542
you're gonna need
to--to hire somebody

00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:57,377
to get to the top of google.

00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:59,146
And guys like me--
we're not cheap.

00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:01,081
Yeah, but I can hire those guys
all day long.

00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,783
You really think that none of us
up here have guys like--

00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,518
I have plenty of guys
like this.
I do, too.

00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:07,087
There's nothing that I can't
do myself. I don't need you.

00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,755
Six months--
time-out. Time-out.

00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,390
I can't hear another word.

00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:12,125
Okay.

00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:15,696
You're probably the worst
presenter I've ever met.

00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:17,564
Oh, come on.
Just 'cause you don't get it

00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:19,499
doesn't mean
he's a bad presenter.
Yes. No, I get it all.
Come on.

00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,468
I've built so many web sites,
I've hired guys like this,

00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:23,270
and you know what?
You talk like all of 'em.

00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:24,505
You know they're like?
Leprechauns.

00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:25,739
They come in the night.
They talk ibber-gibberish.

00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:27,207
You don't get
what they're saying.

00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:29,409
They run away with your wallet.
That's what happens, right.

00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:30,944
Believe me. I've hired
so many guys like you.

00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,379
That's ridiculous.
Barbara, that's ridiculous.

00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:33,881
Well,
it's--it's not ridiculous.

00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:35,949
I've had very bad experience
With guys that talk like this.

00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,652
I don't get it.
I-I definitely failed to get
my--my message across to you.

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,587
Whoa, whoa, Whoa. Yeah, you have
failed to get your message

00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:43,390
across, and I'm listening
with Both ears wide open.

00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:46,059
I really am, okay?
Okay. I appreciate that,
Barbara.

00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,394
You know what
I think you should do?

00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:49,730
I think that you should stick
with being a nerd.

00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,701
I'm out.

00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:56,270
Don't listen to a word
she said.

00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:01,241
Listen, I get your presentation,

00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:02,976
but when I'm an investor
in something,

00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,579
I want there to be something
proprietary about it

00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:08,582
that at least I have a chance
when a competitor comes up,

00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:11,118
that I can pour some boiling oil
on them...

00:09:11,185 --> 00:09:14,655
Yeah.
But I can't do that here because
anybody can do what you do.

00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,724
I gotta tell you,
I love the sport. I really do,

00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,661
because it makes old guys
like me think we're cool.

00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,764
But your valuation is not cool--

00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,166
not $1.5 million today.
I'm out.

00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:35,275
Basically, the bicycle for water
was invented

00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:38,011
about the same time that
the--the biggest social network

00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,913
in the world was invented.

00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,016
And in that time, they've--
they've amassed, you know,

00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,486
500 million Users. Correct?

00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:51,358
The number of bicycles
in the world is 1 billion--

00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,794
twice the amount
of the number of cars.

00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:57,297
This is basically
a bicycle for the water.

00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:59,433
Oh, my god. I have a headache.

00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,202
Okay, I don't think
you understand

00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,670
what we can't get over.
We can't get over

00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:05,172
you've been
in this business three months,

00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:06,874
there's nothing proprietary
about it,

00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,776
you are valuing the business
at $1.5 million.

00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:11,879
The problem is when
a magician starts to believe

00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,047
his own tricks,
that becomes the problem,

00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,782
and with that said, I'm out.

00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,618
Okay. Thanks
for the consideration.

00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:20,787
Um, so you're still in it,
mark.

00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:22,723
I think--I think you
totally understand

00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,391
sort of
the specialized expertise

00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,260
that goes into a business
like this.

00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:28,529
Is anybody else still in?

00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:30,497
I'm still in. I'm still in.
I'm trying to--I'm trying to--

00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:32,599
you know what I'm trying to do?
Because your--your presentation

00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:35,102
is so different...
yeah, I know.

00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:36,303
I'm not saying it's bad
or Good.

00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,738
I'm just saying it's different.

00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,640
I'm trying to structure the deal
that makes sense for me,

00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:41,475
because I'm interested in you.
You're interesting, okay?
Okay.

00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:45,712
So I'm thinking to myself,
why don't I give you $150,000

00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,382
for 50% of this entity,

00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,951
and I'd like to sell
other stuff.

00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:53,253
And I'd want to get my cash back
though,

00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,390
so I want a 10% cash royalty

00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:57,925
on everything you sell.

00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,294
So I'm getting a check
every month,

00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,029
right off the top.

00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:04,298
And if you need more money,
I'll give you more money.

00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:06,099
But I want to be
a 50/50 partner.

00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,101
Sure.
How deep does that well go?

00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,703
Well, I don't know. You have
to dream up the products.

00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,605
You call me up, say, "Hey,
daddy, I got a new idea."

00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:13,307
I say "I don't care."

00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:14,842
I want to be your Banker.

00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:16,844
(Robert) That's exactly
what you're doing.

00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,612
(Kevin) I just want
to give you some cash.

00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,247
I-I think it's interesting,
but I've--I've--honestly,

00:11:20,314 --> 00:11:22,449
you guys, this business is
an $11 million business

00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:25,519
in a few years.
(speaks indistinctly)
Ah, look,
this is today's business.

00:11:25,586 --> 00:11:27,387
Don't you have any other ideas?
This is an opportunity cost
for me. You're saying--

00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:29,356
don't <i>you</i> have any other ideas
on what to sell?

00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:30,691
I do. I have three
other business plans

00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:32,759
that are
$50 million business plans.

00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:34,094

00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:37,898
I have plenty of money.
That's not a problem.

00:11:37,965 --> 00:11:39,399
I-I respect that offer,

00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:41,668
but I told you earlier
in the presentation,

00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:44,004
you can't hire guys like me.
We work for ourselves.
Sure, I can.
I'm doing it right now.

00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:46,273
We--we can--we can call
our own shots. I mean--

00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:50,344

of your company for $150,000.

00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,646
You want to buy 50% of me
is what you're saying.

Well, what's the difference?
What are you guys talking about?
What are you--

You got
a captive audience here.

00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:32,186
What I see here is that you're
starting this business

00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,820
to get it to a point--
because it's

00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:35,989
such an ENORMOUS marketplace--
where you can flip it.

00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:39,493
right? And once we flip that
and you can take that cash,

00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,361
you put some in your pocket,
then you go look

00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,597
for another business
and do the exact same thing.
That's right.

00:12:43,664 --> 00:12:46,867
So I'm willing to give you
$150,000

00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:49,203
for 30% of the company,

00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,804
but the contingency is

00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:54,208
that any future companies
that you go into,

00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:57,544
I get the first right of refusal
so that I don't build this

00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,880

take the money and run.

Okay. Okay.

00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:03,483

on me raising money
on other companies.

00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,687
On any other companies.
'cause if we're--

00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:08,255
if we're successful on this,
right,

00:13:08,322 --> 00:13:10,924
I want to be your partner there
because it's, you know, it takes

00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:13,093
people to work together,
and I'm not gonna be greedy.

00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,828
Yeah.
You can have more than half
of the company...

00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:17,664
Yeah.
And then, you know,
and then in--in True candor,

if there's a big enough hit,
the amount of money

00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:22,503
we're gonna negotiate, and if it
takes a lot more capital,

00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:24,271
I'll get more of the company,
right?

00:13:24,338 --> 00:13:26,507
Yeah. E-e-exactly.
I mean, it's not--

00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:28,509
I don't see the difference.
There's no set percentage
for--

00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:30,010
I see no difference
to what I offered you.
(mark) There's
a huge difference.

00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:32,312
I think the difference is, uh,
you know, Mr. Wonderful,

00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:35,816
I think--I think
he--he understands it more.
He actually called you
Mr. Wonderful.

00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:39,219
No, I get it, too,
but I'm willing to go to 25%.

00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:42,389
Same deal. Same deal. 25%.

00:13:42,456 --> 00:13:43,991
So we're not--we don't have
a lot of time

00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:46,293
to mess around, Stephan.
So you just gotta make your--

00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,295
make a de-decision.
I'm not gonna sit here and get

00:13:48,362 --> 00:13:50,397

not-so-Mr. Wonderful, right?

than I should take

00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:04,278
for 30% of this company,
and I--

00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,146
you're gonna realize that
in about two years.

00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:08,048
What could be a better figure?
But I'm gonna make my money
on the back end.

00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:10,250

Hello, Sharks.

We're Nick and penilopee Larosa
from tampa, Florida.

00:16:36,964 --> 00:16:39,266
Our product
is the instant lifts.

00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,870
We're seeking $100,000
for 25% of our business.

00:16:42,936 --> 00:16:45,939
We have solved
the problem of cellulite

00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,975
and sagging skin for women.

00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,677
The instant lift
are clear dermahesives

00:16:50,744 --> 00:16:52,179
that go on the skin,

00:16:52,246 --> 00:16:54,781
and it lifts
and repositions the skin,

00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:57,751
and it makes everything
look firm and tight.

No. Absolutely not.

And how long does it last?

If you tape yourself up
on a new day...
12 to 15 hours a day.

00:18:03,517 --> 00:18:05,519
How long?
It--you get one use
out of it,

00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:07,654
but it will last
12 to 15 hours.

00:18:07,721 --> 00:18:09,389

00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:12,559

(Robert) no?
We have other products.

00:18:33,347 --> 00:18:35,249

But it would all be
part of the same company?

00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:36,483
(Nick and penilopee) No.

00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,985
Oh.
They're
different patents.

00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:40,087
Different things.
But you're selling me
everything?

00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:41,321
I'm selling you this.
(mark) No.

00:18:41,388 --> 00:18:42,523
(daymond) Nope.

00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:45,325

00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,530
basically, from here down
we can cover it.

00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:50,964
So you're selling me
below the face?

00:18:51,031 --> 00:18:52,299
(laughter)
Yeah.

00:18:52,366 --> 00:18:54,067
But above the face...
that's a different meeting.

00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:55,769
How are you gonna
manage your time, then?

00:18:55,836 --> 00:18:57,237
I mean, if I give you
all this money,

00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:58,839
I don't want you
working on anything

00:18:58,906 --> 00:19:00,440
but what makes me money.

00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:02,743
So how are you gonna work
on two different products,

00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,378
or potentially,
even more?

00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:06,713
We can get it handled.
Piece of Cake.
No, there's no such thing

00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,215
as "Getting it handled,
piece of cake."

00:19:08,282 --> 00:19:11,952
No, they're two entirely
different categories,

00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:14,087
so it wouldn't be--
there wouldn't be a conflict.
But it's the same product.

00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:16,356
Agree with me--it's the same
product. It's the same idea.
I don't agree with you.

00:19:16,423 --> 00:19:19,693
It's the same area
of bus--
from a consumer perspective,
it's the same product.

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,461
Technically,
it might be different,

00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:23,664
but if I'm thinking,
you know what?

00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,599
My Butt--Butt and my arms
need a lift,

00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,068
and, boy, these guys do
a great job.

00:19:28,135 --> 00:19:30,070
I want a Chin lift or
whatever else it might be,

00:19:30,137 --> 00:19:32,072
an eye lift, I'm gonna come
to the same company,

00:19:32,139 --> 00:19:35,609
because of the money spent
on branding this product.

00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:37,377
We might be able to work
something out like that.

00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:39,112
Then we could sell them
the smooth sleepers

00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:42,015
and things like that.
We can talk about that, sure.
We--we have--

00:19:42,082 --> 00:19:43,917
well, hurry up
and start talking.
We have multiple...

00:19:43,984 --> 00:19:45,219
we have multiple
products on the market.
Well, we have
a lot here to sell.

00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:46,220
Yeah?
We do.

00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:47,721
We have a lot here
to start off with.

00:19:47,788 --> 00:19:50,123
Okay, well, I'm gonna
start off with this--I'm out.

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,395
We--we discovered that you've
got another product

00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:56,663
in the same category.

00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,498
Everybody up here
feels uncomfortable with that,

00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:00,467
because, as Mr. Cuban
pointed out,

00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:02,603
you're not working
100% for me anymore

00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:03,770
if I'm an investor.

00:20:03,837 --> 00:20:05,272
There's something
in the back of your mind

00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:07,107
that's using up your time
for somebody else,

00:20:07,174 --> 00:20:09,209
and I can't live with That.

00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:11,411

get to a place...
okay. Let's put
the smooth sleepers in.

00:20:11,478 --> 00:20:13,380
Where you're throwing that
on the table.
Let's put
the smooth sleepers in.

00:20:13,447 --> 00:20:15,983
No, the smooth sleepers are not
what they're talking about.

00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,184
They're talking
about the face Lifts.

00:20:17,251 --> 00:20:19,253
That's not ours.
It's not ours, yes.

00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,722
But wait! There's more!
(Robert) What's the other
product we don't know about?

00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:23,824
This is being Very secretive--
Well, the first product
she invented...

00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:25,626
almost like this product,
you know? When you...
there's no secret
about it.

00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:27,661
But we have a life outside of
these lifts, it's True.

00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:30,564
I have five inventions,
several patents...
right there, guys.
Guys...

00:20:30,631 --> 00:20:33,267
you just proved
Mr. Cuban's point.
The fact is, you just--
you just made my point. Yeah.

00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,302
But...
yeah, but you have all
these other products.

00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:39,406
But we would shelve that
for this.
You just said, "I have
another part of my life."

00:20:39,473 --> 00:20:41,475
We do.
Would you give anybody money
Who would then,

00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:43,177
when you call them back
about the money, they go,

00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:45,579
"Oh, I was doing the other
stuff. I got another life, too."

00:20:45,646 --> 00:20:46,813
Would you really do that?

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,449
No, we are actually not
that kind of people.

00:20:49,516 --> 00:20:50,817
We're very focused.
But you just said that.

00:20:50,884 --> 00:20:53,187
No, I'm telling you
we have other products.

00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:55,022
But if you and I
partnered together,

00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:57,057
this would become
our priority.

00:20:57,124 --> 00:20:59,326
This pitch is really like
that woman I meet

00:20:59,393 --> 00:21:01,295
and I take home,
and she rips that tape off,

00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:03,497
and her bingo wings just
hang out all over the place.

00:21:03,564 --> 00:21:05,299
(Robert) Why is it called
a "Bingo wing"?

00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:07,568
'cause when a-a grandma
is playing bingo,

00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:09,903
and she goes, "Bingo!"
and her wing goes...

00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,773
(laughter)

00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,042
I didn't think
you were so worried

00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:17,211
about some other product.

00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,346
Here's the crazy thing--
I was actually very interested.

00:21:19,413 --> 00:21:21,048
I think there's
a big market for this.

00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:23,150
But you're creating
a new market.

00:21:23,217 --> 00:21:24,751
You're creating a brand

00:21:24,818 --> 00:21:26,220
and you're creating
a category.

00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:29,923
And the category is--use tape
to Make yourself look thinner.

00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:32,926
Right.
I just don't understand how
you can break up body parts.

00:21:32,993 --> 00:21:34,695
Let's sell Barbara
the shoulders.

00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:35,929
Let's sell daymond the legs.

00:21:35,996 --> 00:21:37,497

00:21:37,564 --> 00:21:41,168
Well, you have everything here
except the Face.

00:21:41,235 --> 00:21:42,169
Right.
(laughs)

00:21:42,236 --> 00:21:43,637
And that is
a different part.

00:21:43,704 --> 00:21:45,339
(mark) But not from
our perspective.

00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:47,407
Guys, there's too much confusion
for me. Like I said...
no, no...

00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:48,675
from a strategic
perspective,

00:21:48,742 --> 00:21:50,844
you made some choices--
maybe not the right ones--

00:21:50,911 --> 00:21:51,912
so I'm out.

00:21:53,847 --> 00:21:56,583
You're not making any money now
if you normalized your salaries.

00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:01,555
You're not worth $400,000.
I'm out.

00:22:01,622 --> 00:22:03,123
Okay.

00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,626
I don't think this strategy
sticks together for me.

00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:09,997
It's very confusing.
I'm out.

00:22:10,063 --> 00:22:12,699
Guys, you have
one last chance

00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:16,270
to pitch your
bingo wings--Barbara.

00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:19,907
There's a lot of women out there
that won't even wear shorts.

00:22:19,973 --> 00:22:21,909
I believe you.
Here's what I think.
What are you doing, Barbara?

00:22:21,975 --> 00:22:23,911
I'm a woman, certainly,

00:22:23,977 --> 00:22:29,082
and I could envision a lot
of women using this product.

00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:30,684
But the money
is just too much

00:22:30,751 --> 00:22:33,153
for the very little bit
of sales you have.

00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:36,089
I'm out.

00:22:36,156 --> 00:22:38,959
I think we're all out.
It's done.

00:22:45,032 --> 00:22:46,767
(Barbara) it is pricy,
I have to say.

00:22:46,834 --> 00:22:49,069
I don't get it. I think
it's a big disappointment

00:22:49,136 --> 00:22:50,637
when you finally untape
your woman

00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:52,606
and you see
what you actually got.
(laughs)

00:22:52,673 --> 00:22:54,141
(high-pitched voice)
"Bingo!"

00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,943
I wish we could get in there
and do it again

00:22:56,009 --> 00:22:58,011
and just not bring up
the face tape

00:22:58,078 --> 00:23:00,714
and--and just focus on
the--the arm lifts

00:23:00,781 --> 00:23:01,815
and the body Lifts.

Hi. My name is Gary dejohn

00:23:27,474 --> 00:23:28,575
and I'll be your server
tonight,

00:23:28,642 --> 00:23:30,711
and I am so tired
of saying that.

00:23:30,777 --> 00:23:33,146
I have developed a product that
is going to revolutionize

00:23:33,213 --> 00:23:35,015
the way
we serve wine worldwide.

00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:37,518
I'm asking for
a $75,000 investment

00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:40,854
for 30% equity in my company,
vinamor.

00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:44,858
Wine is a living organism.
When it is bottled,

00:23:44,925 --> 00:23:46,593
the winemaker
basically puts it to sleep,

00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,996
and it needs to be
woken up before tasting.

00:23:49,062 --> 00:23:51,865
People are continually let down
by the Harsh tannins and acidity

00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:54,835
associated with red wine,
so they've turned to this--

00:23:54,902 --> 00:23:57,471
a traditional wine decanter.

00:23:57,538 --> 00:24:00,073
Take the entire contents
of a bottle,

00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,276
pour it in the top...
it's messy.

00:24:06,246 --> 00:24:08,949
Now here's the hard part.

00:24:09,016 --> 00:24:10,317
You wait about an hour.

00:24:10,384 --> 00:24:13,020
My product does this
in just seconds.

00:24:13,086 --> 00:24:14,621
This is how it works--

00:24:14,688 --> 00:24:18,225
the vinamor sits neatly
in the top of any wine glass.

00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:21,562
As you pour the wine through the
strainer and over the ball,

00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:23,163
it exposes
all the wine to air,

00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,465
gives it the most amount
of surface area possible,

00:24:25,532 --> 00:24:27,334
and allows the wine
to breathe.

00:24:27,401 --> 00:24:30,337
Every glass of wine poured
at home or in restaurants

00:24:30,404 --> 00:24:32,139
needs to be poured
through a vinamor

00:24:32,206 --> 00:24:33,907
to give it
the proper taste.

00:24:33,974 --> 00:24:37,244
With a $75,000 investment,
I will be able to manufacture

00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:39,680
on a much grander scale
than I currently can,

00:24:39,746 --> 00:24:41,849
and it will also kick-start
my marketing campaign

00:24:41,915 --> 00:24:43,917
to get these into every house,
every restaurant,

00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:47,187
and every Liquor store
nationwide.

00:24:47,254 --> 00:24:49,256
Now Kevin would like
to come up here

00:24:49,323 --> 00:24:51,959
and test taste
a couple of these for me.

00:24:54,094 --> 00:24:58,198
I'm gonna pour one
in a regular wine glass

00:24:58,265 --> 00:25:01,068
and one with the vinamor.

00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:08,008
All right.

00:25:08,075 --> 00:25:09,576
This one's been aerated?
Absolutely.

00:25:15,182 --> 00:25:17,451
Yeah, it works.
(laughs)

00:25:17,518 --> 00:25:19,419
I'll just keep this.
Sure.

00:25:19,486 --> 00:25:20,521
(laughter)

00:25:22,756 --> 00:25:24,024
Um, Gary...

00:25:24,091 --> 00:25:26,360
yes, sir.
There are many aerators
on the market.

00:25:26,426 --> 00:25:27,494
There are.
I own them all.

00:25:27,561 --> 00:25:29,763
And, uh, this is
a novel design, obviously,

00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,498
but it's not unique.

00:25:31,565 --> 00:25:33,667
It's also a little more delicate
'cause it's glass, is it not?

00:25:33,734 --> 00:25:35,335
It is a little bit
more delicate,

00:25:35,402 --> 00:25:37,237
however, we can make it out of
a really nice acrylic

00:25:37,304 --> 00:25:38,539
and make it
a little bit more durable.

00:25:38,605 --> 00:25:39,773
But tell me
what the difference

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,509
between the aerators
I already have and this--

00:25:42,576 --> 00:25:45,646
they both aerate wine
very successfully.

00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:48,515
They do. However,
the other ones

00:25:48,582 --> 00:25:51,552
can't measure
a glass of wine.

00:25:51,618 --> 00:25:54,021
So when you're looking at
a restaurant scenario...

00:25:54,087 --> 00:25:55,389
so you're saying
you tell the staff

00:25:55,455 --> 00:25:56,690
to pour to
the middle of the ball?

00:25:56,757 --> 00:25:58,058
Right. Absolutely.

00:25:58,125 --> 00:25:59,660
It cuts your
overpouring costs,

00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:02,262
and, I mean,
it's dual-Purpose.

00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:04,464
Cuts your overpouring costs,
gets every ounce of profit

00:26:04,531 --> 00:26:06,133
out of every bottle
at every Restaurant.

00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,102
Gary, can I see it?
Sure.

00:26:09,169 --> 00:26:10,737
Thank you.
Mark.

00:26:10,804 --> 00:26:13,006
It's clever.

00:26:15,676 --> 00:26:17,711
Thank you, Gary.
You're welcome.

00:26:17,778 --> 00:26:19,112
So are you seeing this

00:26:19,179 --> 00:26:22,149
for probably more high-end
restaurants that have a cellar?

00:26:22,216 --> 00:26:25,419
Not necessarily,
but you can brand this.

00:26:25,485 --> 00:26:28,188
When you look at a store
like the Olive garden,

00:26:28,255 --> 00:26:30,457
you could basically put
the Olive garden logo

00:26:30,524 --> 00:26:32,359
inside the ball

00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:34,161
and then sell them
as a retail item.

00:26:34,228 --> 00:26:36,163
Gary, do you have
any sales today?

00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:39,132
Um, not much. I've sold
about 1,000 of them.

00:26:41,969 --> 00:26:43,337
And to whom?

00:26:43,403 --> 00:26:44,404
Uh, direct to consumer.

00:26:44,471 --> 00:26:45,806
I actually--I work
in a restaurant.

00:26:45,873 --> 00:26:47,441
Uh, that's where
the idea came from.

00:26:47,508 --> 00:26:50,744
And pretty much every one
of my tables that drinks wine

00:26:50,811 --> 00:26:53,080
takes one home.
And what do they sell for?

00:26:53,146 --> 00:26:54,815
$40.
And what's your cost?

00:26:54,882 --> 00:26:57,417
$20.
That's way too high
for this.

00:26:57,484 --> 00:26:58,919
Absolutely.
It is way too high.

00:26:58,986 --> 00:27:01,788
And that's why
I need an investment,

00:27:01,855 --> 00:27:07,294
to take this overseas and make
as much profit as possible.

00:27:07,361 --> 00:27:09,429
How much I know
about wine, or care...

00:27:09,496 --> 00:27:10,931
Mm-Hmm.

00:27:10,998 --> 00:27:12,900
Wouldn't even fit into
one of those glasses. I'm out.

00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:17,004
What's your plan
for distribution for this?

00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:20,407
Basically, if I can get them
into every restaurant

00:27:20,474 --> 00:27:23,510
that serves wine,
then we've got free salespeople

00:27:23,577 --> 00:27:25,345
in the restaurant.

00:27:25,412 --> 00:27:29,116
Restaurants don't sell
wine Apparel.

00:27:29,183 --> 00:27:32,619
Yet.

00:27:32,686 --> 00:27:34,154
It's complicated--
the Design.

00:27:34,221 --> 00:27:35,989
Who designed that?
I did.

00:27:36,056 --> 00:27:37,291
Gary, what gave you the idea?

00:27:37,357 --> 00:27:39,860
Um, it's actually a statistic
that in restaurants,

00:27:39,927 --> 00:27:43,063
if you finish your first glass
of wine before your entree,

00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:45,399
the chances of you ordering
a second glass of wine

00:27:45,465 --> 00:27:47,034
are 78% higher.

00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,069
So now you've
increased your sales

00:27:49,136 --> 00:27:51,238
at every Single table
That's drinking Wine.

00:27:51,305 --> 00:27:54,708
Gary, I don't know anything
about this market,

00:27:54,775 --> 00:27:56,510
so I can't help you in this.

00:27:56,577 --> 00:27:58,212
I'm out.

00:27:58,278 --> 00:28:00,414
Hey, Gary, I hate
to join the chorus,

00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,316
but, you know, I have a rule--

00:28:02,382 --> 00:28:05,319
I don't trust any bottle of wine
that costs more than $5.

00:28:05,385 --> 00:28:07,321
And so...
try that. Try that.

00:28:07,387 --> 00:28:09,223
Put a $5 bottle of wine
through there,

00:28:09,289 --> 00:28:11,325
and it'll make it taste like
a $50 bottle of wine.

00:28:11,391 --> 00:28:13,794
I'm a beer drinker,
not a wine drinker at all.

00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:15,062
So, I-I really couldn't help.

00:28:15,128 --> 00:28:16,530
So for that reason,
I'm out.

00:28:19,633 --> 00:28:21,935
Gary, I think there is
a market for the product,

00:28:22,002 --> 00:28:25,105
but it's just not something
that I want to invest in.

00:28:25,172 --> 00:28:26,240
I'm out.

00:28:28,175 --> 00:28:29,943
Only the wino's left.

00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,678
Only the wino's left.

00:28:31,745 --> 00:28:33,947
So, Gary, you know,
I take the product Works.

00:28:34,014 --> 00:28:35,349
Thank you.
It's not unique.

00:28:35,415 --> 00:28:37,918
And the only way
to make this work

00:28:37,985 --> 00:28:39,620
is for you to license this.

00:28:39,686 --> 00:28:41,722
It's not a project I want
to take on, my friend.

00:28:41,788 --> 00:28:42,856
I'm sorry. I'm out.

00:28:42,923 --> 00:28:44,491
Are you sure?
I am sure.

00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:47,261
I am sure. The only thing
you've differentiated--

00:28:47,327 --> 00:28:48,829
'cause I know every aerator
on the market--

00:28:48,896 --> 00:28:51,632
is this measurement concept
for the restaurant industry,

00:28:51,698 --> 00:28:55,102
which is a small subset
of the total aeration market.

00:28:55,169 --> 00:28:56,803
The thing is, I like
to go make money

00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:59,673
so I can buy
$2,000 bottles of wine.
Right.

00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,475
And I drink the whole thing
with a straw.

00:29:01,542 --> 00:29:04,278
I'll do it for 45%.

00:29:04,344 --> 00:29:06,847
Gary, I have to pick
my battles,

00:29:06,914 --> 00:29:09,349
and, um, use my time wisely.

00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:10,551
I'm sorry, my friend.

00:29:10,617 --> 00:29:12,753
Anybody else want back in?

00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:13,820
(laughs)
(mark) smart man.

00:29:13,887 --> 00:29:15,389
Barbara?

00:29:15,455 --> 00:29:17,024
No, thank you.
No?

00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:20,160
Mark, I'm gonna go put on
my nowitzki jersey.
I wish I could.

00:29:20,227 --> 00:29:22,763
(laughs)
I give you a little money,
you give me a little money.

00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:24,498
You know, I got
fubu boxers on.

00:29:24,565 --> 00:29:26,600
If I knew this business,
you'd be a great partner,

00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:27,801
and that would be
a great product.

00:29:27,868 --> 00:29:29,102
I-I just can't help you.

00:29:29,169 --> 00:29:31,738
Okay. Well,
thank you for your time.

00:29:31,805 --> 00:29:33,340
Go get 'em, Gary.
Good luck.

00:29:35,475 --> 00:29:37,444
(Robert) Love that guy.
Good guy.

00:29:37,511 --> 00:29:38,612
Small niche product.

00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:40,314
The guy had
the hustle and the heart.

00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,149
It doesn't make me feel happy
that they weren't interested,

00:29:42,216 --> 00:29:44,117
but they're not
the only investors out there.

00:29:44,184 --> 00:29:46,253
And when I sell
for $40 million next year,

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,455
then I can come back
and laugh at them.

00:30:25,926 --> 00:30:27,995
digital music education.

00:30:28,062 --> 00:30:32,099
I'm looking for $300,000
for 5% of the company.

00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:33,968
Oh.
(Kevin) Miso Baby.

00:30:34,035 --> 00:30:36,470
Hope you have some sales.
Me so greedy.

00:30:36,537 --> 00:30:38,005
We--we'll get into that.

00:30:38,072 --> 00:30:39,540
Yeah, I bet we will.
(laughs)

00:30:39,607 --> 00:30:41,208
Um, so there are a lot
of different aspects

00:30:41,275 --> 00:30:42,443
to the company
that we have.

00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,745
The first Commercial application
that we had

00:30:44,812 --> 00:30:46,180
launched in June.

00:30:46,247 --> 00:30:49,083
And it's an ipad and iphone app
called miso music.

00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:51,585
And it teaches people
how to play, uh, the guitar,

00:30:51,652 --> 00:30:53,854
ukulele, Bass,
banjo and Mandolin.

00:30:53,921 --> 00:30:55,923
Uh, and I'm gonna
show you that right now.

00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,858
So, uh, there are a couple
different ways

00:30:57,925 --> 00:30:59,894
that the app can be used.

00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,962
Uh, let's say you don't have
a real instrument.

00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:04,965
You can use a virtual instrument
that we have in the app.

00:31:05,032 --> 00:31:06,567
I'm gonna use
a koaloha ukulele.

00:31:06,634 --> 00:31:09,236
You wanna select
right here.

00:31:09,303 --> 00:31:11,105
And I'm gonna play a song
that I really enjoy

00:31:11,172 --> 00:31:13,407
called "Be ok"
By Ingrid Michaelson.

00:31:13,474 --> 00:31:14,742
So the way that this works

00:31:14,809 --> 00:31:16,877
is the notes scroll down
the face of the guitar

00:31:16,944 --> 00:31:18,479
similar to a game
like guitar hero.

00:31:18,546 --> 00:31:20,114
And when it hits
the yellow tempo bar,

00:31:20,181 --> 00:31:21,248
you're supposed to play.

00:31:21,315 --> 00:31:27,188
(plays melody)

00:31:27,254 --> 00:31:29,623
But Let's say I want to do it
using a real instrument.

00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,759
We have, uh,
these adapters,

00:31:31,826 --> 00:31:35,062
which allow you to plug your
guitar directly into the ipad.

00:31:35,129 --> 00:31:36,564
And I'm gonna play
the same song,

00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:40,134
except this time I'm going
to grab the ukulele.

00:31:40,201 --> 00:31:41,602
So I'm going to come
over to here,

00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:43,170
and it should show up
on the back.

00:31:43,237 --> 00:31:52,046
(plays melody)

00:31:52,113 --> 00:31:54,749
So I can't really
do this song Justice.

00:31:54,815 --> 00:31:56,984
Uh, so I've actually
brought with me

00:31:57,051 --> 00:31:59,553
Ingrid Michaelson to perform
her hit song herself.

00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,455
(laughs)
Oh, my gosh.

00:32:01,522 --> 00:32:02,423
Great.

00:32:41,962 --> 00:32:44,498

You do? I'm in!

00:32:44,565 --> 00:32:45,766
(daymond) I'm in,
I'm in, I'm in.
(laughs)

00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:47,201
Aviv, so very smart
to bring Ingrid here

00:32:47,268 --> 00:32:49,036
to help sell your product.
Thank you.

00:32:49,103 --> 00:32:50,137
She's also an advisor
to the company.

00:32:50,204 --> 00:32:51,539
And damn, she can sing.

00:32:51,605 --> 00:32:53,741
What's your background?
Are you a musician?

00:32:53,808 --> 00:32:55,676
My Dad's a recording engineer,
my mom's an opera Singer.

00:32:55,743 --> 00:32:58,346
Uh, I worked in entertainment.

00:32:58,412 --> 00:33:00,181
So this is your first...

00:33:00,247 --> 00:33:02,183
it's my first
tech Company. Yeah.

00:33:02,249 --> 00:33:04,585
So, uh, yeah.
We debuted this technology.

00:33:04,652 --> 00:33:06,454
Afterwards, we closed
an INVESTMENT round

00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,989
led by google ventures.

00:33:08,055 --> 00:33:09,824
What percentage of investment
did google take?

00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:12,426
Uh, google did $100,000.

00:33:12,493 --> 00:33:14,228
Uh, we had people LIKE
Justin Timberlake

00:33:14,295 --> 00:33:16,197
Come on board, as well,
uh, in the company.

00:33:16,263 --> 00:33:17,798
Oh, drop a few names, maybe?
(laughs)

00:33:17,865 --> 00:33:20,101
Let's talk about
a couple of things here--

00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:21,602
do I have to be
a hardcore musician?

00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:23,604
Can I just be a Hacker?

00:33:23,671 --> 00:33:25,606
What am I?
Who's your customer?

00:33:25,673 --> 00:33:27,174
Well, uh, you know,
it's both.

00:33:27,241 --> 00:33:29,043
We want to be able
to target the casual musician,

00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,711
people who just want
to learn more music.

00:33:30,778 --> 00:33:32,513
You know, sheet music
sells in this country.

00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,315
It's a $600 million a year
industry.

00:33:34,382 --> 00:33:36,751
It's $600 million?

00:33:36,817 --> 00:33:39,854
In the United States alone.
Are you selling--
are you selling scripts?

00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,455
Selling sheet music?
Yes, absolutely.

00:33:41,522 --> 00:33:43,324
So we have, you know,
a whole store

00:33:43,391 --> 00:33:44,759
where you can do
in-app purchases.

00:33:44,825 --> 00:33:46,160
What are the sales
today, aviv?

00:33:46,227 --> 00:33:49,130
So in the past month,
we've had 80,000 downloads.

00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:50,631
So when you say "Download,"
what are we downloading?

00:33:50,698 --> 00:33:52,633
So the app--
the ipad app.

00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,802
Ipad app, okay.
And the app I'm downloading

00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:56,671
was the one that'll let you
play the Music.

00:33:56,737 --> 00:33:57,972
Exactly.
And how much is it?

00:33:58,039 --> 00:34:00,608
Uh, the app is free.

00:34:00,675 --> 00:34:03,110
How do you get revenue
off that,

00:34:03,177 --> 00:34:05,246
or is there
any revenue today?
There is.

00:34:05,313 --> 00:34:06,981
So we have
in-app purchases.

00:34:07,048 --> 00:34:09,784
So you can buy sheet music
from a variety of artists.

00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:11,385
We have a huge catalog
of sheet music

00:34:11,452 --> 00:34:12,553
which is growing every day.

00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,855
We're converting
about 8% of our users

00:34:14,922 --> 00:34:17,758
into paying customers,
which is...
and what--what are
they paying for,

00:34:17,825 --> 00:34:19,860
the sheet music
or an upgraded app?

00:34:19,927 --> 00:34:21,262
They're paying
for the sheet music.

00:34:21,329 --> 00:34:23,464
So we're looking
to not just have customers

00:34:23,531 --> 00:34:24,699
Come on board
and buy one song.

00:34:24,765 --> 00:34:26,434
We're looking
to retain customers,

00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,235
to have people
who come back regularly...
hmm.

00:34:28,302 --> 00:34:29,637
And buy music from us.
So--so the idea is,

00:34:29,704 --> 00:34:32,206
you're making an app,
it's cool, it's fun,

00:34:32,273 --> 00:34:34,075
people come to it
as a community,

00:34:34,141 --> 00:34:35,443
and then, when they're there,

00:34:35,509 --> 00:34:37,411
you're going to
sell them sheet music.
Exactly.

00:34:37,478 --> 00:34:38,913
So you just found
a clever way

00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:42,149
to go after
a traditional market.

00:34:42,216 --> 00:34:45,486
Exactly, and we've also created
some pretty profound technology.

00:34:45,553 --> 00:34:46,954
But you're not gonna sell that.

00:34:47,021 --> 00:34:48,789
It's just--it's all
part of the packaging.

00:34:48,856 --> 00:34:50,157
Exactly. So, you know,

00:34:50,224 --> 00:34:52,693
digital sheet Music
distribution

00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,729
has not been
particularly successful.

00:34:54,795 --> 00:34:56,998
And the reason--
Well, it's not sexy.
You've made it sexy.

00:34:57,064 --> 00:34:58,499
Exactly.

00:34:58,566 --> 00:35:03,571
Now you're valuing
the company at $6 million.

00:35:03,638 --> 00:35:04,705
Yes.

00:35:04,772 --> 00:35:07,508
Where are you getting
that value from?

00:35:07,575 --> 00:35:09,110
Well, I mean, most people
look at a company

00:35:09,176 --> 00:35:11,979
and you base valuation
on traction or technology.

00:35:12,046 --> 00:35:14,048
What was the last round
of investment done at?

00:35:14,115 --> 00:35:16,784
Uh, the last one was done
at a $3 million valuation.

00:35:16,851 --> 00:35:19,954
So why... why do I have
to pay twice as much?

00:35:20,021 --> 00:35:21,856
I mean, we have
a lot more software.

00:35:21,922 --> 00:35:24,025
A huge amount
more software.
When was the last round done?

00:35:24,091 --> 00:35:25,993
Uh, the last round
closed in december.

00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,762
So we're talking
six months later

00:35:27,828 --> 00:35:29,263
and the company's
doubled in value?

00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:30,264
Yes.

00:35:30,331 --> 00:35:32,967
Throw me a bone, miso.

00:35:33,034 --> 00:35:36,504
Why would you say that it
doubled in value in six months?
Yeah.

00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:38,239
How would you justify that?
Well, I mean, I think that

00:35:38,306 --> 00:35:39,473
the second
that Justin Timberlake

00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,875
and google came on board,
the value raised.

00:35:40,941 --> 00:35:42,376
Does it work
for every instrument,

00:35:42,443 --> 00:35:44,078
or it's Only
stringed instruments?

00:35:44,145 --> 00:35:45,946
Well, this app is
only stringed instruments.

00:35:46,013 --> 00:35:48,149
We're actually working on
standard music notation

00:35:48,215 --> 00:35:50,084
right now, which will go
across all platforms.

00:35:50,151 --> 00:35:52,486
And our note detection
technology

00:35:52,553 --> 00:35:55,056
works across
all instruments.
(mark) and what did you say
your revenue was?

00:35:55,122 --> 00:35:57,358
Uh, so we've had--
for the sheet music sales,

00:35:57,425 --> 00:35:59,493
we've had 35,000 downloads.

00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,998
Uh, it equates to about
$40,000, uh, in sales.

00:36:04,065 --> 00:36:07,201
So this is why it doesn't
make sense here.

00:36:07,268 --> 00:36:09,637
You have incredible artists.

00:36:09,704 --> 00:36:12,506
You also have google
and people who have money.

00:36:12,573 --> 00:36:13,607
Right?
Mm-hmm.

00:36:13,674 --> 00:36:15,476
You have something out
for $1.2 million,

00:36:15,543 --> 00:36:19,513
and you're insulting us
with an offer of 5%.

00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:23,484
You don't really want
to make a deal here, do you?

00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:24,986
No, I would love to.

00:36:25,052 --> 00:36:27,788
I-I think that you guys are all
really brilliant investors.

00:36:27,855 --> 00:36:29,557
And I'd love
to have you guys on board.

00:36:29,623 --> 00:36:31,726
Then why is it 5%?

00:36:31,792 --> 00:36:33,894
There is something
fishy here,

00:36:33,961 --> 00:36:36,931
because you have
everything you need.

00:36:36,998 --> 00:36:39,900
♪♪

00:36:45,973 --> 00:36:49,910

You have incredible artists.

There is something

00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,323
so I'm out.

00:37:35,389 --> 00:37:38,759
May I? I just want to clear
the deck a little bit here.

00:37:38,826 --> 00:37:41,662
I've been burned
by Technology businesses

00:37:41,729 --> 00:37:43,898
many times before,

00:37:43,964 --> 00:37:46,867
and they go through money
WAY too fast.

00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,271
I'm out.

00:37:55,209 --> 00:37:58,412
Okay. So let me try to
understand exactly what you own.

00:37:58,479 --> 00:38:00,781
Yeah.
Right. Did you develop
the software involved here?

00:38:00,848 --> 00:38:02,683
Yes.
Okay.

00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:05,653
Everything's been
developed ourselves.
Do you own the I.P.
On all the code?

00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,989
Uh, we do.
I look at this
as, like, an option.

00:38:08,055 --> 00:38:09,290
You've got an interesting
platform here.

00:38:09,357 --> 00:38:11,058
I have no idea if
you'll be successful or not.

00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:12,893
But so far,
it looks pretty good.

00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,929
I think that We're going
to be the leaders

00:38:14,996 --> 00:38:17,031
in Digital music education.

00:38:17,098 --> 00:38:19,834
I mean, it's been a field
that hasn't had success.

00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,536
But there hasn't really
been an interactive way

00:38:22,603 --> 00:38:25,006
for people to be able
to learn music online.

00:38:25,072 --> 00:38:26,107
Let me throw
something out here.

00:38:26,173 --> 00:38:28,242
'cause to me, you know,
I-I like guitar,

00:38:28,309 --> 00:38:30,478
I like Ingrid. I like you.

00:38:30,544 --> 00:38:32,913
Google options you--they give
you 100 grand just to say,

00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,348
"Who the hell knows What's gonna
happen with this guy?

00:38:34,415 --> 00:38:36,117
Let's throw some money at him."
That's how I feel.

00:38:36,183 --> 00:38:39,587
So I'll offer you $100,000,
which is an option amount,

00:38:39,654 --> 00:38:42,123
but I want 3 1/3%.
In other words,

00:38:42,189 --> 00:38:43,824
it's the same valuation
as the last round.

00:38:43,891 --> 00:38:45,926
Will somebody else--
he's asking for $300,000.

00:38:45,993 --> 00:38:48,996
You gotta stick
with $300,000.
I have $100,000 I want
to throw at him. That's all.

00:38:49,063 --> 00:38:51,999
He has to raise
the other $200,000.
Oh, no!

00:38:52,066 --> 00:38:53,000
What a problem.

00:38:53,067 --> 00:38:54,902
(laughter)

00:38:54,969 --> 00:38:57,405
So you want the same value
as before,

00:38:57,471 --> 00:39:00,141
and you want aviv
to go out and...
You're a smart guy, Robert.

00:39:00,207 --> 00:39:01,976
Well, you want aviv to go out
and get the other $200,000

00:39:02,043 --> 00:39:05,112
from another two sharks?
That's why they call it
work, my friend.

00:39:07,248 --> 00:39:09,083
So you understand what
he's saying to you right now?

00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,718
Yeah.
Yeah, he's a smart guy.

00:39:10,785 --> 00:39:12,620
Who's left on this deal?
Mark, you're in still?

00:39:12,687 --> 00:39:14,922
I know he's smart.
I'm still--
I'm still evaluating.

00:39:14,989 --> 00:39:16,257
I mean, I'm not really
interested

00:39:16,324 --> 00:39:17,525
in doing it
at the last valuation.

00:39:17,591 --> 00:39:20,227
I mean, we have other money
on the table, as well.

00:39:20,294 --> 00:39:22,129
So this is--honestly, it has
less to do...

00:39:22,196 --> 00:39:23,531
Well, that's a bit
of a problem.

00:39:23,597 --> 00:39:26,334
'cause I didn't need
to go in with Kevin.

00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,803
I was gonna offer you
the entire $300,000

00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:32,773
if you'd consider the same
value as you took initially.

00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,476
I-I mean...
so $300,000 for 10%.

00:39:35,543 --> 00:39:37,611
Yeah. We have money
on the table.

00:39:37,678 --> 00:39:39,547
The reason why I want
you guys to come on board

00:39:39,613 --> 00:39:41,182
is 'cause I want
strategic investors.
Well, if you have money
on the table,

00:39:41,248 --> 00:39:42,516
why would you be here?

00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:43,784
Because I want you guys.

00:39:43,851 --> 00:39:46,253
Okay, well you got me.
$300,000 for 10%.

00:39:50,358 --> 00:39:52,760
I'm having a problem
having to pay twice as much

00:39:52,827 --> 00:39:55,229
as some guys did, basically,
when you closed it

00:39:55,296 --> 00:39:56,831
probably 90 days ago.

00:40:01,702 --> 00:40:04,805
Um, I mean, I can do...

00:40:04,872 --> 00:40:08,843
I can do the $300,000...

00:40:08,909 --> 00:40:10,711
for 7% equity.

00:40:10,778 --> 00:40:12,446
Which...
you're only
300 basis points away

00:40:12,513 --> 00:40:15,850
from where We need to be.

00:40:15,916 --> 00:40:17,451
Uh...

00:40:20,488 --> 00:40:24,158
the Real issue behind this is if
I lower the VALUATION too much,

00:40:24,225 --> 00:40:26,694
it--it's gonna hurt me
on the other end

00:40:26,761 --> 00:40:31,399
while I'm raising
the rest of this money.

00:40:31,465 --> 00:40:34,135
I offered you
the $300,000 for 10%.

00:40:34,201 --> 00:40:35,903
Um...

00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:38,506
aviv, I'm not gonna
match that offer.

00:40:38,572 --> 00:40:40,541
I'm out.

00:40:42,076 --> 00:40:45,212
 <i>With Three sharks out,</i>
 <i>Kevin and mark</i>

00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:47,381
 <i>are aviv's last chances</i>
 <i>to make a deal.</i>

00:40:47,448 --> 00:40:49,650
Aviv, what is the thing
that's gonna accelerate you

00:40:49,717 --> 00:40:51,552
to where it's
a very big enterprise?

00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:54,622
Well, music education is
a $9 billion a year industry.
Right.

00:40:54,689 --> 00:40:56,057
That's a--
that's a huge market.

00:40:56,123 --> 00:40:58,826
Do you see being able to charge
for a premium version

00:40:58,893 --> 00:41:00,561
and upsell people?

00:41:00,628 --> 00:41:01,862
That's something that
we had actually talked about.

00:41:01,929 --> 00:41:03,698
We've always stated
that the app is free

00:41:03,764 --> 00:41:05,366
for a limited time
when we first launched.

00:41:05,433 --> 00:41:06,901
Right.
Uh, so yeah,

00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:09,203
I-I would--I definitely
am leaving it open to that.

00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:11,005
Yeah, I-I've got
a better understanding now.

00:41:11,072 --> 00:41:14,608
So what I'm willing to do
is the $300,000

00:41:14,675 --> 00:41:17,912
for 8%.

00:41:17,979 --> 00:41:19,780
Are you doing
the whole $300,000 yourself?

00:41:19,847 --> 00:41:21,349
I'll do the whole $300,000
myself, Yeah.

00:41:21,415 --> 00:41:22,683
It's a no-brainer.

00:41:24,885 --> 00:41:27,655
Okay. I'll do the same terms.
I'll do $100,000 of it.

00:41:27,722 --> 00:41:29,790
If he doesn't wanna let me in,
that's cool, too.

00:41:29,857 --> 00:41:31,993
But you may wanna have
as many sharks as you can.

00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:34,161
Particularly ones that
can actually play something.

00:41:34,228 --> 00:41:36,530
(laughs) Hey, I actually 
play a few instruments.

00:41:36,597 --> 00:41:38,432
Maybe not well, but I play.
Not well. I-I heard you.

00:41:38,499 --> 00:41:41,302
(laughs)

00:41:41,369 --> 00:41:42,803
I'll do half of it.

00:41:45,106 --> 00:41:47,008
Obviously, I'd love
to do a deal with you.

00:41:47,074 --> 00:41:49,510
You don't need Kevin.

00:41:49,577 --> 00:41:54,482
You'd rather work
with me...

00:41:54,548 --> 00:41:55,850
because I understand it,

00:41:55,916 --> 00:41:59,453
and I'm not gonna
be beating you up all the time.

00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,588
We have a deal?

00:42:04,558 --> 00:42:06,260
You got it.

00:42:06,327 --> 00:42:07,261
Awesome.

00:42:07,328 --> 00:42:08,929
Appreciate it, aviv.
Thank you.

00:42:08,996 --> 00:42:10,064
Yeah, Pleasure.
Congratulations.

00:42:10,131 --> 00:42:11,098
Thanks a lot.

00:42:11,165 --> 00:42:12,233
(Barbara) Well,
what happened to you?

00:42:12,299 --> 00:42:13,434
I guess I got cut out.

00:42:13,501 --> 00:42:14,735
The undertaker
gets Buried.

00:42:14,802 --> 00:42:16,804
That's okay.
You got ran over
by a bus.

00:42:16,871 --> 00:42:18,906
The undertaker
got buried.
I still have my cash.

00:42:18,973 --> 00:42:20,875
She was great,
by the way.
She was.

00:42:20,941 --> 00:42:22,276
You know what
the best part is?

00:42:22,343 --> 00:42:24,078
He's smart, and I
don't have to babysit.

00:42:24,145 --> 00:42:25,813
I think it's a good deal.

00:42:27,248 --> 00:42:29,283
I am so stoked!
Oh, my god!

00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:31,285
This is exactly
the deal that we wanted.

00:42:31,352 --> 00:42:34,255
And I-I'm just giddy.
I'm so happy.
