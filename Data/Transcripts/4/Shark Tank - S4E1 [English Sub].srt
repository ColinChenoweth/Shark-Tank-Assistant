00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:06,213
They either don't
wear a coat...

00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:07,414
 

00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,317
or they could wear a soft,
warm, and cozy coat,

00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:10,384
 

00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:13,153

babysit it all night.

00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:13,220
 

00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,988
I wish I'd put
a leash on mine

00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:15,055
 

00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:16,323

it was stolen

00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:20,327

00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:22,429

that I went up to a manager

00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:22,496
 

00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:25,165

00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:25,232
 

00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:27,968

way too much of a hassle.

00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:28,035
 

00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:30,037
So I asked them, "can I
open one up myself?"

00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:30,103
 

00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,939

00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:38,145
why no one
provides coat checks.

00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:40,013
This is the security.

00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:40,080
 

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,250
It's just not organized
or effective.

00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:43,317
 

00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:44,384
May I present to you

00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:44,451
 

00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,220
our ticketless
coat check system?

00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:46,286
 

00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,222
With our innovative technology,

00:04:48,222 --> 00:04:48,288
 

00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,390
we match a person's face
to their belonging.

00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:50,457
 

00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,192
You simply hand over
your coat

00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:52,259
 

00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,229
and then type your name
into the system,

00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:55,295
 

00:04:55,295 --> 00:05:00,067
and a picture is taken
automatically.

00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:00,133
 

00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,035
All you do from there,
you just pay.

00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,371
 

00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:06,006
It's that easy.

00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:08,242
 

00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:11,044
There's no more dealing
with tickets.

00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:11,111
 

00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:14,114
She can now see a picture
of the person and their coat

00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:14,181
 

00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:16,350
to make sure she's giving it
back to the right person.

00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:16,416
 

00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,219
It is time
to turn an inconvenience

00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:19,286
 

00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:20,354
into an opportunity.

00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:20,420
 

00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,423
So how 'bout one of you
writes me a check?

00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:23,490
 

00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,160
And I'll check you
into coatchex.

00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,227
 

00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:30,097
Do you have any sales?

00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:30,163
 

00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,999
No, I've not made--

00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:32,065
 

00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,201
the technology,
we just started.

00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:34,268
 

00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:35,202
Derek, what is the business?

00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:35,269
 

00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:36,970
Is the business the service

00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:37,037
 

00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:39,006
or are you trying
to sell the technology?

00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:39,072
 

00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,107
We're franchising.

00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:40,174
 

00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:42,176
We have a system now
and we have equipment

00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:42,242
 

00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:44,077
so that anyone can sort of
do what I did.

00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:44,144
 

00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:46,213
So you want to sell
the computer, the design...

00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:46,280
 

00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,016
Yes.
Everything.
I buy the franchise...

00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:49,082
 

00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,017
exactly.
That's the business model?

00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:50,083
 

00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,151
Okay. So, Derek,
what is the plan

00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:51,218
 

00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:53,387
to sell $100,000
of these units?

00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:53,453
 

00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,389
We're starting to get agreements
with area developers right now.

00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:55,455
 

00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,324
For example, in Chicago,

00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:57,391
 

00:05:57,391 --> 00:06:00,260
someone says to me, "Hey--
I need 50 franchises opened.

00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:00,327
 

00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:02,129
"I'm willing
to put down $150,000

00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:02,196
 

00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:04,064
"to start off in equipment

00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:04,131
 

00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:05,999
to get this out there
in Chicago."
So wait, wait,
let me get this straight--

00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:06,066
 

00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,068
You have not sold
any of these yet?

00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:08,135
 

00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:10,404
Nope. We just--
So you haven't had
a chance to test it, right?

00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:10,470
 

00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,273
Yeah.
And you're going out
and you're selling franchises

00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:13,340
 

00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,976
to area developers...
who are--

00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:16,043
 

00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:18,312
Who are then gonna, in turn,
go and sell them to franchisees?

00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:18,378
 

00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,347
Exactly.
Horrible!

00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:20,414
 

00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:22,216
Horrible!

00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:24,084
 

00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:25,953
<i>Horrible </i>idea!
Let me ask you something.

00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:26,019
 

00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,120
How do you really feel
about it?

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,187
 

00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:28,222
Horrible!

00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:28,288
 

00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:30,090
Because you haven't tested it.

00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:30,157
 

00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:32,226
Anybody who's done anything
in technology knows

00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:32,292
 

00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:35,229
that the only certainty
is that it's gonna screw up.

00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:35,295
 

00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:37,197
Derek, why don't you go
to the busiest steakhouse

00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:37,264
 

00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:38,298
near where you live,

00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:38,365
 

00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:40,400
and say to the person there
that owns it,

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:40,467
 

00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:42,069
"Let me install this
for free.

00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:42,135
 

00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,204
"you've got 500 coats
coming in here every night.

00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:44,271
 

00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:46,139
Let me watch it work
for 90 days."

00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:46,206
 

00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:47,374
Why wouldn't you do that?

00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:47,441
 

00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:50,210
I want to. It's just too warm
right now in Indianapolis.

00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:50,277
 

00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:54,414
(sharks laugh)

00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:54,481
 

00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:55,415
I love it!

00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:55,482
 

00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,150
So it's seasonal.

00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:57,217
 

00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:58,952
How many of those coats

00:06:58,952 --> 00:06:59,019
 

00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:01,121
did you steal yourself?

00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:01,188
 

00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:06,226
You're asking for 10%
for $200,000, right?

00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:06,293
 

00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:08,161
Yes, I know this.
So for $2 million

00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:08,228
 

00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:10,063
that you're valuating
your company at,

00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:10,130
 

00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,165
you are a thief.

00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:12,232
 

00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:16,136
Let me tell you why
I'm valuating it at $2 million.
I'm so fascinated.

00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:16,203
 

00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:18,105
I would love to hear why.

00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:18,172
 

00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:21,975
We have a patent on
our ticketless bailment system.

00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:22,042
 

00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,243
Bailment?

00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:23,310
 

00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,312
Bailment--It's whenever you hand
over a belonging to someone,

00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:25,379
 

00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:28,215
and they keep it
for a certain period of time.
Give me another example.

00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:28,282
 

00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:31,318
Valet, dry cleaning,
rental services,

00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:31,385
 

00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:34,254
um, any kind of
baggage holding services.
Oh.

00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:34,321
 

00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:36,156
You have a patent
on all of that?

00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:36,223
 

00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:38,192
Yes.

00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:38,258
 

00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:40,000
That's--That's interesting. But--

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,166
 

00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,467
You're not investing
in just coat checks.

00:07:41,467 --> 00:07:41,767
 

00:07:41,767 --> 00:07:42,801
We want to get this

00:07:42,801 --> 00:07:42,868
 

00:07:42,868 --> 00:07:44,870
into all the different
bailment situations.

00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:44,936
 

00:07:44,936 --> 00:07:46,772
You're just in
the development stage.
Exactly.

00:07:46,772 --> 00:07:46,838
 

00:07:46,838 --> 00:07:49,508
What's the whole capital cost
to put all this together?

00:07:49,508 --> 00:07:49,574
 

00:07:49,574 --> 00:07:50,776
We were gonna sell it
for $1,500.

00:07:50,776 --> 00:07:50,842
 

00:07:50,842 --> 00:07:52,678
Walk us through the money.

00:07:52,678 --> 00:07:52,744
 

00:07:52,744 --> 00:07:54,413
How much do you charge
to check a coat?

00:07:54,413 --> 00:07:54,479
 

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,580
Anywhere from $2 to $5,

00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:55,647
 

00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,449
depending on the scale
of the event.

00:07:57,449 --> 00:07:57,516
 

00:07:57,516 --> 00:07:58,884
How do you pay the people
that own the venue?

00:07:58,884 --> 00:07:58,950
 

00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:02,421
Revenue split. We gain
15% of revenue.
15? 1-5?

00:08:02,421 --> 00:08:02,487
 

00:08:02,487 --> 00:08:03,588
15. 1-5.

00:08:03,588 --> 00:08:03,655
 

00:08:03,655 --> 00:08:06,825
Are there any other competitors
out there like this?

00:08:06,825 --> 00:08:06,892
 

00:08:06,892 --> 00:08:09,594
Nothing like this at all.

00:08:09,594 --> 00:08:11,797
 

00:08:11,797 --> 00:08:14,599
I know a little bit
about this space.

00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:14,666
 

00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,803
And unfortunately,
I think you're incorrect.

00:08:17,803 --> 00:08:17,869
 

00:08:17,869 --> 00:08:19,871
There are similar products.

00:08:19,871 --> 00:08:19,938
 

00:08:19,938 --> 00:08:22,541
I don't think you're educated
enough in this space,

00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:22,607
 

00:08:22,607 --> 00:08:25,477
but I think
you have a lot of drive.

00:08:25,477 --> 00:08:25,544
 

00:08:25,544 --> 00:08:26,545
I'm out.

00:08:26,545 --> 00:08:28,513
 

00:08:28,513 --> 00:08:32,784
You don't have a--a plan
for distribution and sales,

00:08:32,784 --> 00:08:32,851
 

00:08:32,851 --> 00:08:34,653
which is the greatest challenge.

00:08:34,653 --> 00:08:34,720
 

00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,889
You can only sell this
six months of the year.

00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:37,956
 

00:08:37,956 --> 00:08:39,891
It's a seasonal sale.

00:08:39,891 --> 00:08:39,958
 

00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,793
Summer comes along,
nobody cares.

00:08:41,793 --> 00:08:41,860
 

00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,896
I hate seasonal businesses.

00:08:44,896 --> 00:08:44,963
 

00:08:44,963 --> 00:08:47,499
And for that reason, Derek,

00:08:47,499 --> 00:08:47,566
 

00:08:47,566 --> 00:08:48,700
I'm out.

00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,736
 

00:08:50,736 --> 00:08:53,605
It struck me like it takes
entirely too long

00:08:53,605 --> 00:08:53,672
 

00:08:53,672 --> 00:08:55,641
to check in a coat.
What we're gonna do is,
essentially,

00:08:55,641 --> 00:08:55,707
 

00:08:55,707 --> 00:08:56,675
it's gonna be an iphone app,

00:08:56,675 --> 00:08:56,742
 

00:08:56,742 --> 00:08:58,777
you just come up,
scan your Q.R. Code.

00:08:58,777 --> 00:08:58,844
 

00:08:58,844 --> 00:09:00,712
(Barbara) I think it's easier
to get a ticket and run.

00:09:00,712 --> 00:09:00,779
 

00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:02,514
I'm out.

00:09:02,514 --> 00:09:04,549
 

00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:07,419
So, Derek, let's take stock
of where we're at right now.

00:09:07,419 --> 00:09:07,486
 

00:09:07,486 --> 00:09:08,887
Okay. Yeah, yeah.
You've got three
sharks out.

00:09:08,887 --> 00:09:08,954
 

00:09:08,954 --> 00:09:11,723
Mm-hmm.
On either end are two
that are still in.

00:09:11,723 --> 00:09:11,790
 

00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,426
Mm-hmm.
I'd ignore
the guys in the middle.

00:09:14,426 --> 00:09:14,493
 

00:09:14,493 --> 00:09:16,728
Start working on trying to get
some money out of these people.

00:09:16,728 --> 00:09:16,795
 

00:09:16,795 --> 00:09:18,563
Okay. Well, I'd like
to say one thing--

00:09:18,563 --> 00:09:18,630
 

00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,499
I'm just out of college.

00:09:20,499 --> 00:09:20,565
 

00:09:20,565 --> 00:09:21,700
This is why I'm here.

00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:21,767
 

00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:23,835
I'm trying to figure out
the best ways to scale this.

00:09:23,835 --> 00:09:23,902
 

00:09:23,902 --> 00:09:25,671
One of my partners
is my professor

00:09:25,671 --> 00:09:25,737
 

00:09:25,737 --> 00:09:27,839
who did venture capital
and entrepreneurial finance.

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:27,906
 

00:09:27,906 --> 00:09:29,808
You know--
Derek, I like the idea.

00:09:29,808 --> 00:09:29,875
 

00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:32,577
You can go to universities
and other venues,

00:09:32,577 --> 00:09:32,644
 

00:09:32,644 --> 00:09:34,746
you franchise it
down the road...
Mm-hmm.

00:09:34,746 --> 00:09:34,813
 

00:09:34,813 --> 00:09:36,715
And that becomes part of
the proprietary advantage,

00:09:36,715 --> 00:09:36,782
 

00:09:36,782 --> 00:09:38,784
is you lock those venues down.

00:09:38,784 --> 00:09:38,850
 

00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,852
So you do
a multiyear contract

00:09:40,852 --> 00:09:40,919
 

00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:43,789
with dance halls, sports bars,
and places like that.

00:09:43,789 --> 00:09:43,855
 

00:09:43,855 --> 00:09:47,492
Museums, malls.
And then you hire a couple guys
to try to pitch it

00:09:47,492 --> 00:09:47,559
 

00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:49,761
to dry cleaners
or places like that.

00:09:49,761 --> 00:09:49,828
 

00:09:49,828 --> 00:09:53,832
But it's worth
$2 million, Robert.

00:09:53,832 --> 00:09:53,899
 

00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:56,435
I--I can't get
to the $2 million.

00:09:56,435 --> 00:09:56,501
 

00:09:56,501 --> 00:09:57,569
Help me out there.

00:09:57,569 --> 00:09:57,636
 

00:09:57,636 --> 00:09:59,538
I'm willing to negotiate.

00:09:59,538 --> 00:09:59,604
 

00:09:59,604 --> 00:10:00,639
(laughs)
Oh, you think?

00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:00,706
 

00:10:00,706 --> 00:10:01,707
You gotta start high.

00:10:01,707 --> 00:10:01,773
 

00:10:01,773 --> 00:10:03,475
I mean, come on.
Let's be real here.

00:10:03,475 --> 00:10:03,542
 

00:10:03,542 --> 00:10:05,610
And at the same--You know,
I'll take more money.

00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:05,677
 

00:10:05,677 --> 00:10:06,778
Let's talk--
Let's talk numbers.
(sharks laugh)

00:10:06,778 --> 00:10:06,845
 

00:10:06,845 --> 00:10:08,814
You will take more money?
I wanna be clear on that.

00:10:08,814 --> 00:10:08,880
 

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,716
Robert, I don't know
a guy in the hood,

00:10:10,716 --> 00:10:10,782
 

00:10:10,782 --> 00:10:12,417
I know a guy
in Beverly Hills

00:10:12,417 --> 00:10:12,484
 

00:10:12,484 --> 00:10:14,419
that'll go around hanging
your coats for $2 million.

00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:14,486
 

00:10:14,486 --> 00:10:15,487
(laughter)

00:10:15,487 --> 00:10:15,554
 

00:10:15,554 --> 00:10:16,722
Mark, where are you at
with this?

00:10:16,722 --> 00:10:16,788
 

00:10:16,788 --> 00:10:18,657
Look, I like it, but I need
to know more about you.
Okay.

00:10:18,657 --> 00:10:18,724
 

00:10:18,724 --> 00:10:20,759
Okay, so you walk
in the door,

00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:20,826
 

00:10:20,826 --> 00:10:23,462
and I'm telling you,
your business plan is horrible.

00:10:23,462 --> 00:10:23,528
 

00:10:23,528 --> 00:10:25,630
(Robert)
Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty bad.
What plan?

00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:25,697
 

00:10:25,697 --> 00:10:26,631
What do you mean, "what plan"?
here's the plan--

00:10:26,631 --> 00:10:26,698
 

00:10:26,698 --> 00:10:29,468
I wanna get $2 million
and leave.

00:10:29,468 --> 00:10:29,534
 

00:10:29,534 --> 00:10:30,769
There's gonna be
hard decisions to make.

00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:30,836
 

00:10:30,836 --> 00:10:33,638
Are you the type of person
that you'll do the right thing

00:10:33,638 --> 00:10:33,705
 

00:10:33,705 --> 00:10:34,806
and you'll make
the hard decisions?

00:10:34,806 --> 00:10:34,873
 

00:10:34,873 --> 00:10:36,642
That's what I want
to know.

00:10:36,642 --> 00:10:36,708
 

00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,410
I don't--
Yes, but I'm all open

00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:38,477
 

00:10:38,477 --> 00:10:40,746
to listening to people
who have been there before.

00:10:40,746 --> 00:10:40,812
 

00:10:40,812 --> 00:10:43,615
So, Derek, I-I love this.
I just...

00:10:43,615 --> 00:10:43,682
 

00:10:43,682 --> 00:10:46,518
make me another offer
Under $2 million.

00:10:46,518 --> 00:10:46,585
 

00:10:46,585 --> 00:10:48,420
I can't get
to the $2 million.

00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:48,487
 

00:10:48,487 --> 00:10:49,488
Um...

00:10:49,488 --> 00:10:50,656
 

00:10:50,656 --> 00:10:51,790
uh...

00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:51,857
 

00:10:51,857 --> 00:10:54,459
I asked for $200,000
because it's-It's a start.

00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:54,526
 

00:10:54,526 --> 00:10:55,861
It's gonna get me
to commercialization.

00:10:55,861 --> 00:10:55,927
 

00:10:55,927 --> 00:10:58,497
He--He asked you
a very, very simple question.

00:10:58,497 --> 00:11:01,833
 

00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:05,637

♪♪♪

00:11:12,811 --> 00:11:12,878
 

00:11:12,878 --> 00:11:15,847
Make me another offer
under $2 million.

00:11:15,847 --> 00:11:15,914
 

00:11:15,914 --> 00:11:18,717
I can't get
to the $2 million.

00:11:18,717 --> 00:11:18,784
 

00:11:18,784 --> 00:11:21,887
Um, I asked for $200,000
because it's--It's a start.

00:11:21,887 --> 00:11:21,953
 

00:11:21,953 --> 00:11:23,655
It's gonna get me

00:11:23,655 --> 00:11:23,722
 

00:11:23,722 --> 00:11:25,991
He--He asked you

00:11:25,991 --> 00:11:30,896
 

00:11:30,896 --> 00:11:32,731
Okay. Um...

00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:32,798
 

00:11:32,798 --> 00:11:36,735
for $200,000...

00:11:36,735 --> 00:11:36,802
 

00:11:36,802 --> 00:11:38,670
Let's start talking...

00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:38,737
 

00:11:38,737 --> 00:11:40,939
$1.5 mil valuation?

00:11:40,939 --> 00:11:41,006
 

00:11:41,006 --> 00:11:41,940
Does that work?

00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,007
 

00:11:42,007 --> 00:11:44,009
What would that be?
Uh, 15%?

00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:44,076
 

00:11:44,076 --> 00:11:46,545
I'll start talking
$1.5 mil.
So he went from 10%

00:11:46,545 --> 00:11:46,611
 

00:11:46,611 --> 00:11:49,948
to 15%. His company is now
$1.5 million, Robert.

00:11:49,948 --> 00:11:50,015
 

00:11:50,015 --> 00:11:51,850
Zero sales.

00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,786
 

00:11:54,786 --> 00:11:55,787
I'm out.

00:11:55,787 --> 00:11:59,858
 

00:11:59,858 --> 00:12:01,893
And then there was just
one left.

00:12:01,893 --> 00:12:05,831
 

00:12:05,831 --> 00:12:06,999
Let's take a step back.

00:12:06,999 --> 00:12:09,835
 

00:12:09,835 --> 00:12:12,571
Makes perfect sense
in my mind,

00:12:12,571 --> 00:12:12,637
 

00:12:12,637 --> 00:12:13,939
particularly since
you haven't tested it,

00:12:13,939 --> 00:12:14,006
 

00:12:14,006 --> 00:12:15,874
or really have
a track record yet,

00:12:15,874 --> 00:12:15,941
 

00:12:15,941 --> 00:12:18,910
to build "X" number
of these things

00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:18,977
 

00:12:18,977 --> 00:12:21,980
and take them where we can
create a track record.

00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,047
 

00:12:22,047 --> 00:12:23,849
Because once you've created
a track record

00:12:23,849 --> 00:12:23,915
 

00:12:23,915 --> 00:12:24,950
in any business,

00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:25,017
 

00:12:25,017 --> 00:12:28,954
your leverage and your value
goes like this.

00:12:28,954 --> 00:12:29,021
 

00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:32,024
I've been doing that
my entire adult life.

00:12:32,024 --> 00:12:32,090
 

00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,859
But you need the help.

00:12:33,859 --> 00:12:33,925
 

00:12:33,925 --> 00:12:36,795
I do.
And so this isn't a partnership
that's just about cash.

00:12:36,795 --> 00:12:36,862
 

00:12:36,862 --> 00:12:38,897
Your issue is knowledge
and experience.

00:12:38,897 --> 00:12:38,964
 

00:12:38,964 --> 00:12:39,965
Yes.

00:12:39,965 --> 00:12:40,032
 

00:12:40,032 --> 00:12:41,600
So I'm gonna make you
an offer,

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:41,667
 

00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:43,602
and you can say "Yes" or "No"
very quickly,

00:12:43,602 --> 00:12:43,669
 

00:12:43,669 --> 00:12:46,872
because I don't mess around.

00:12:46,872 --> 00:12:46,938
 

00:12:46,938 --> 00:12:49,808
The offer is $200,000

00:12:49,808 --> 00:12:49,875
 

00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,944
for 33%.

00:12:52,944 --> 00:12:53,011
 

00:12:53,011 --> 00:12:56,581
Because I have--
Are you crazy?

00:12:56,581 --> 00:12:56,648
 

00:12:56,648 --> 00:12:57,883
Relax.
This is a great offer.

00:12:57,883 --> 00:12:57,949
 

00:12:57,949 --> 00:12:59,751
Love the offer.

00:12:59,751 --> 00:12:59,818
 

00:12:59,818 --> 00:13:00,819
You're ruining the tank

00:13:00,819 --> 00:13:00,886
 

00:13:00,886 --> 00:13:02,954
by Giving this kind
of money away.

00:13:02,954 --> 00:13:04,756
 

00:13:04,756 --> 00:13:07,759
Can I talk to my business
partner about this?

00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:07,826
 

00:13:07,826 --> 00:13:08,994
Go ahead and call
your business partner.
I can call him
real quick?

00:13:08,994 --> 00:13:09,061
 

00:13:09,061 --> 00:13:10,829
Real quick.
Thank you so much.

00:13:10,829 --> 00:13:10,896
 

00:13:10,896 --> 00:13:11,963
Uh-huh.

00:13:11,963 --> 00:13:12,030
 

00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:15,634
Well, Mark, you just
gave him a $600,000 valuation.

00:13:15,634 --> 00:13:15,701
 

00:13:15,701 --> 00:13:18,570
Honestly, if it does
what it says it does,

00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:18,637
 

00:13:18,637 --> 00:13:19,838
I could flip it
in silicon valley

00:13:19,838 --> 00:13:19,905
 

00:13:19,905 --> 00:13:20,839
in about 15 seconds.

00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:20,906
 

00:13:20,906 --> 00:13:23,575
Jerry. So we got
an offer from mark--

00:13:23,575 --> 00:13:23,642
 

00:13:23,642 --> 00:13:25,777
$200,000 for 33%.

00:13:25,777 --> 00:13:25,844
 

00:13:25,844 --> 00:13:28,847
Honestly, he threw out
a great, um, pitch on his part

00:13:28,847 --> 00:13:28,914
 

00:13:28,914 --> 00:13:31,616

help us get out there.

00:13:31,616 --> 00:13:31,683
 

00:13:31,683 --> 00:13:32,884
You know, we haven't
proven anything.

00:13:32,951 --> 00:13:34,619

00:13:34,619 --> 00:13:34,686
 

00:13:34,686 --> 00:13:37,022
Everyone else is going crazy
that he's giving this offer.

00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:39,024

I wouldn't do it.

00:13:43,762 --> 00:13:43,829
 

00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:45,664

discussed yet

00:13:45,664 --> 00:13:45,731
 

00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:47,966
is that you take it
to New York...
your value is worth 90%.

00:13:47,966 --> 00:13:48,033
 

00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:49,735

00:13:49,735 --> 00:13:49,801
 

00:13:49,801 --> 00:13:52,738
where they charge $10,
$15, $20 for coat check?

00:13:52,738 --> 00:13:52,804
 

00:13:52,804 --> 00:13:55,774
Mark, you're valuing
the company at $600,000.

00:13:55,774 --> 00:13:55,841
 

00:13:55,841 --> 00:13:57,809

00:13:57,809 --> 00:13:57,876
 

00:13:57,876 --> 00:13:59,044
Don't do this.

00:13:59,044 --> 00:14:03,015
 

00:14:03,015 --> 00:14:04,850
Listen, Mark,
I'm from Pittsburgh,

00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:05,951

00:14:05,951 --> 00:14:06,018
 

00:14:06,018 --> 00:14:08,587
Don't be a foolish man.

00:14:08,587 --> 00:14:08,654
 

00:14:08,654 --> 00:14:10,589
I would love
to work with you.

00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:10,656
 

00:14:10,656 --> 00:14:12,691

Oh, oh, oh!

00:14:14,793 --> 00:14:14,860
 

00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,728
I wanted to prove

00:14:16,728 --> 00:14:16,795
 

00:14:16,795 --> 00:14:19,598

that I could really

00:14:19,598 --> 00:14:19,665
 

00:14:19,665 --> 00:14:21,566

00:14:21,566 --> 00:14:21,633
 

00:14:21,633 --> 00:14:22,901

taking it or not?

For right now, that is
the valuation of the company.

00:14:29,641 --> 00:14:29,708
 

00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,943

to develop it a little bit more.

00:14:35,814 --> 00:14:35,881

00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:38,617

00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:42,587

00:14:42,587 --> 00:14:44,956
 

00:14:44,956 --> 00:14:47,559

that are valuing this

00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:47,626
 

00:14:47,626 --> 00:14:48,960

00:14:49,961 --> 00:14:50,028
 

00:14:50,028 --> 00:14:51,563
They're not giving you

Yes or no?

Slow down and think about it
one more time.

00:14:56,735 --> 00:14:56,802
 

00:14:56,802 --> 00:14:58,937

$2 million, $1.5 million.

00:14:58,937 --> 00:14:59,004
 

00:14:59,004 --> 00:15:00,639

00:17:46,769 --> 00:17:47,436
 

00:17:47,436 --> 00:17:47,503
 

00:17:47,503 --> 00:17:50,439
♪♪♪

00:17:50,439 --> 00:17:58,033
 

00:17:58,033 --> 00:17:58,967
My name Jay Kriner,

00:17:58,967 --> 00:17:59,034
 

00:17:59,034 --> 00:18:01,166
and I am an unexploded ordnance
technician.

00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:01,232
 

00:18:01,232 --> 00:18:03,168
I dispose of bombs.

00:18:03,168 --> 00:18:03,234
 

00:18:03,234 --> 00:18:06,033
There are millions
of unexploded devices

00:18:06,033 --> 00:18:06,099
 

00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:07,234
all around the world...
(beeps)

00:18:07,234 --> 00:18:07,301
 

00:18:07,301 --> 00:18:08,869
From a tiny bullet

00:18:08,869 --> 00:18:08,936
 

00:18:08,936 --> 00:18:10,433
to a major missile
that was rocket propelled.

00:18:10,433 --> 00:18:10,500
 

00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,335
There's very little room
for error.

00:18:12,335 --> 00:18:12,402
 

00:18:12,402 --> 00:18:13,503
If something did happen,

00:18:13,503 --> 00:18:13,570
 

00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,604
there could be a "ba-boom,"

00:18:14,604 --> 00:18:14,671
 

00:18:14,671 --> 00:18:17,373
and there's no more Jay.

00:18:17,373 --> 00:18:17,440
 

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,675
Bombs pay the bills right now,

00:18:18,675 --> 00:18:18,742
 

00:18:18,742 --> 00:18:20,376
But family comes first.

00:18:20,376 --> 00:18:20,443
 

00:18:20,443 --> 00:18:22,379
My wife Jenna and I
are having our first kid,

00:18:22,379 --> 00:18:22,445
 

00:18:22,445 --> 00:18:24,647
so it's extremely important
that I stay out of harm's way.

00:18:24,647 --> 00:18:24,714
 

00:18:24,714 --> 00:18:27,550
With my product, I know that
I can create a safer future

00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:27,617
 

00:18:27,617 --> 00:18:28,685
for me and my family.

00:18:28,685 --> 00:18:28,752
 

00:18:28,752 --> 00:18:31,354
I've put tons of years
of thought into this.

00:18:31,354 --> 00:18:31,421
 

00:18:31,421 --> 00:18:33,356
Now it's time to take it
to the next level.

00:18:33,356 --> 00:18:33,423
 

00:18:33,423 --> 00:18:34,391
And with the sharks' help,

00:18:34,391 --> 00:18:34,457
 

00:18:34,457 --> 00:18:36,693
I know this business will...
ba-bam!

00:18:36,693 --> 00:18:51,341
 

00:18:51,341 --> 00:18:53,410
Hello. My name is Jay Kriner,

00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:53,476
 

00:18:53,476 --> 00:18:55,678
and my product and business
is the Bev Buckle.

00:18:55,678 --> 00:18:55,745
 

00:18:55,745 --> 00:18:58,448
I am seeking $50,000

00:18:58,448 --> 00:18:58,515
 

00:18:58,515 --> 00:19:01,451
in exchange for 10% equity
in my business.

00:19:01,451 --> 00:19:01,518
 

00:19:01,518 --> 00:19:04,287
The Bev Buckle is one of
the most interesting Inventions

00:19:04,287 --> 00:19:04,354
 

00:19:04,354 --> 00:19:05,488
America has ever seen.

00:19:05,488 --> 00:19:05,555
 

00:19:05,555 --> 00:19:07,424
Picture this--You're at
a sporting event,

00:19:07,424 --> 00:19:07,490
 

00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:09,692
a concert,
fishing at the river,

00:19:09,692 --> 00:19:09,759
 

00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:11,394
and you feel the need
to free up your hands

00:19:11,394 --> 00:19:11,461
 

00:19:11,461 --> 00:19:12,629
of your beverage...

00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:12,695
 

00:19:12,695 --> 00:19:13,663
Ba-bam!
(Robert) Oh, my god.

00:19:13,663 --> 00:19:13,730
 

00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:17,634
(sharks laugh)
Oh-Ho-Ho, man!

00:19:17,634 --> 00:19:17,700
 

00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,702
Oh, that is a great idea.

00:19:19,702 --> 00:19:19,769
 

00:19:19,769 --> 00:19:21,371
It's the only buckle
on the market

00:19:21,371 --> 00:19:21,438
 

00:19:21,438 --> 00:19:23,373
that can fold out
to hold your beverage.

00:19:23,373 --> 00:19:23,440
 

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,442
Did Christmas come early?

00:19:25,442 --> 00:19:25,508
 

00:19:25,508 --> 00:19:27,677
Yes, it did.
(laughter)

00:19:27,677 --> 00:19:27,744
 

00:19:27,744 --> 00:19:31,281
Everyone knows someone
Who would want one.

00:19:31,281 --> 00:19:31,347
 

00:19:31,347 --> 00:19:33,750
I can design the faceplate
to have any brand,

00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:33,817
 

00:19:33,817 --> 00:19:39,355
any logo, and any color.
Licensing, branding.

00:19:39,355 --> 00:19:39,422
 

00:19:39,422 --> 00:19:40,557
So keep
that cold beverage close,

00:19:40,557 --> 00:19:40,623
 

00:19:40,623 --> 00:19:41,758
and those hands free,

00:19:41,758 --> 00:19:41,825
 

00:19:41,825 --> 00:19:43,626
because it's the Bev Buckle.

00:19:43,626 --> 00:19:43,693
 

00:19:43,693 --> 00:19:45,361
Ba-Bam!

00:19:45,361 --> 00:19:45,428
 

00:19:45,428 --> 00:19:46,563
Ba-Bam!
Ba-Bam, baby!

00:19:46,563 --> 00:19:46,629
 

00:19:46,629 --> 00:19:48,331
How did you come up
with this idea?

00:19:48,331 --> 00:19:48,398
 

00:19:48,398 --> 00:19:49,432
I was in college,

00:19:49,432 --> 00:19:49,499
 

00:19:49,499 --> 00:19:50,533
and I'm out
with my friends a lot,

00:19:50,533 --> 00:19:50,600
 

00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,502
and we went to bars,
having some good times,

00:19:52,502 --> 00:19:52,569
 

00:19:52,569 --> 00:19:54,504
and I-I just--out of habit,
I kept doing this.

00:19:54,504 --> 00:19:54,571
 

00:19:54,571 --> 00:19:55,772
And I thought to myself,

00:19:55,772 --> 00:19:55,839
 

00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:58,475
man, if I could just
hold my beer hands-free,

00:19:58,475 --> 00:19:58,541
 

00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:01,277
I could, uh, maybe show off
my poor dance moves, or...

00:20:01,277 --> 00:20:01,344
 

00:20:01,344 --> 00:20:02,746
(laughs)

00:20:02,746 --> 00:20:03,033
 

00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:08,000
Can I see one of
those buckles? Do you mind?
Absolutely.

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,067
 

00:20:08,067 --> 00:20:09,868
Doesn't come with the belt?

00:20:09,868 --> 00:20:09,935
 

00:20:09,935 --> 00:20:10,667
Thank you, sir.

00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:10,734
 

00:20:10,734 --> 00:20:12,035
It's heavy. Whoo.

00:20:12,035 --> 00:20:12,102
 

00:20:12,102 --> 00:20:14,071
Is it a magnet
that's holding it closed?

00:20:14,071 --> 00:20:14,138
 

00:20:14,138 --> 00:20:15,072
It is.

00:20:15,072 --> 00:20:15,139
 

00:20:15,139 --> 00:20:16,840
Do you have any sales now?

00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:16,907
 

00:20:16,907 --> 00:20:18,675
I have actually
gone across America

00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:18,742
 

00:20:18,742 --> 00:20:20,878
and personally sold,
at festivals and other events,

00:20:20,878 --> 00:20:20,944
 

00:20:20,944 --> 00:20:22,146
over 4,000 units.

00:20:22,146 --> 00:20:23,814
 

00:20:23,814 --> 00:20:25,115
Over what period of time?

00:20:25,115 --> 00:20:25,182
 

00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,117
Over four years.

00:20:27,117 --> 00:20:28,886
 

00:20:28,886 --> 00:20:31,121
What does that translate to
in sales?

00:20:31,121 --> 00:20:31,188
 

00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:34,825
We're at $340,000.

00:20:34,825 --> 00:20:34,892
 

00:20:34,892 --> 00:20:35,859
Do you have a patent?

00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:35,926
 

00:20:35,926 --> 00:20:36,860
Yes.

00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:36,927
 

00:20:36,927 --> 00:20:38,896
What's your cost
to make these?

00:20:38,896 --> 00:20:38,962
 

00:20:38,962 --> 00:20:39,963
It's, uh, $10.

00:20:39,963 --> 00:20:40,030
 

00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,133
And I sell it for $35,
up to $110,

00:20:43,133 --> 00:20:43,200
 

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,068
depending on
what's on the face.

00:20:45,068 --> 00:20:45,135
 

00:20:45,135 --> 00:20:46,804
Let's ask Mr. China here.

00:20:46,804 --> 00:20:46,870
 

00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,739
It's a good price?
Pretty good price, Yeah.

00:20:48,739 --> 00:20:48,806
 

00:20:48,806 --> 00:20:50,808
What's your
full-time job, Jay?

00:20:50,808 --> 00:20:50,874
 

00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:51,975
I just got out of school

00:20:51,975 --> 00:20:52,042
 

00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,077
to be an unexploded ordnance
technician.

00:20:54,077 --> 00:20:54,144
 

00:20:54,144 --> 00:20:55,779
What does that mean?

00:20:55,779 --> 00:20:55,846
 

00:20:55,846 --> 00:20:57,881
Identification
and remediation

00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:57,948
 

00:20:57,948 --> 00:20:59,983
on unexploded
military ordnance.

00:20:59,983 --> 00:21:00,050
 

00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,718
So it's like "The Hurt Locker"?

00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:01,785
 

00:21:01,785 --> 00:21:03,654
you're looking
for guys with bombs?
Absolutely.

00:21:03,654 --> 00:21:03,720
 

00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,788
Do you want to do that?

00:21:04,788 --> 00:21:04,855
 

00:21:04,855 --> 00:21:05,923
That is my plan "B."

00:21:05,923 --> 00:21:05,989
 

00:21:05,989 --> 00:21:08,025
I need something that I can
provide for my family.

00:21:08,025 --> 00:21:08,092
 

00:21:08,092 --> 00:21:09,126
I got my first kid
on the way,

00:21:09,126 --> 00:21:09,193
 

00:21:09,193 --> 00:21:10,727
so I have to have something
to fall back on.

00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:10,794
 

00:21:10,794 --> 00:21:11,829
The only problem
with your job,

00:21:11,829 --> 00:21:11,895
 

00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:12,996
if you make
a mistake one day,

00:21:12,996 --> 00:21:13,063
 

00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,665
you'll be in five pieces.

00:21:14,665 --> 00:21:14,731
 

00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,733
This is true.
There are no mistakes.

00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:16,800
 

00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,936
So, Jay,
what's the game plan?

00:21:18,936 --> 00:21:19,002
 

00:21:19,002 --> 00:21:20,003
You get the $50,000.
Yeah?

00:21:20,003 --> 00:21:20,070
 

00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,972
What happens tomorrow?

00:21:21,972 --> 00:21:22,039
 

00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:23,107
I'll actually let you choose

00:21:23,107 --> 00:21:23,173
 

00:21:23,173 --> 00:21:25,075
Between option number 1

00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:25,142
 

00:21:25,142 --> 00:21:27,678
and option number 2.

00:21:27,678 --> 00:21:27,744
 

00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:28,946
(sharks laugh)

00:21:28,946 --> 00:21:29,012
 

00:21:29,012 --> 00:21:29,947
I love this guy!

00:21:29,947 --> 00:21:30,013
 

00:21:30,013 --> 00:21:30,948
Which one of you

00:21:30,948 --> 00:21:31,014
 

00:21:31,014 --> 00:21:32,716
want to see
which is in what?

00:21:32,716 --> 00:21:32,783
 

00:21:32,783 --> 00:21:33,750
Number 1!

00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:33,817
 

00:21:33,817 --> 00:21:35,919
I have a list for you
of some people

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:35,986
 

00:21:35,986 --> 00:21:37,955
that want it
in every store they own.

00:21:37,955 --> 00:21:38,021
 

00:21:38,021 --> 00:21:40,057
So here you've got
Urban Outfitters,

00:21:40,057 --> 00:21:40,124
 

00:21:40,124 --> 00:21:43,127
Cowboy Harley Davidson,
Boston Beer Company,

00:21:43,127 --> 00:21:43,193
 

00:21:43,193 --> 00:21:44,828
Seaside Marketing.

00:21:44,828 --> 00:21:44,895
 

00:21:44,895 --> 00:21:46,864
And number 2 is a list

00:21:46,864 --> 00:21:46,930
 

00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,900
of every major raceway

00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:49,967
 

00:21:49,967 --> 00:21:51,668
that wants the buckle
sold trackside.

00:21:51,668 --> 00:21:51,735
 

00:21:51,735 --> 00:21:53,003
Daytona, Talladega,

00:21:53,003 --> 00:21:53,070
 

00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,872
Darlington, Michigan,
Watkins Glen,

00:21:54,872 --> 00:21:54,938
 

00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,106
Nascar and other
pro events.

00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:56,173
 

00:21:56,173 --> 00:21:59,042
Any of those people
written you a check?

00:21:59,042 --> 00:21:59,109
 

00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,779
No, because
I have an issue.

00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:01,845
 

00:22:01,845 --> 00:22:04,915
I came into a problem
with my manufacturer.

00:22:04,915 --> 00:22:04,982
 

00:22:04,982 --> 00:22:08,952
My recent Order
was 26% defective.

00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:09,019
 

00:22:09,019 --> 00:22:10,020
Whoa.

00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:10,087
 

00:22:10,087 --> 00:22:12,723
Yes.
Bad news, Jay.

00:22:12,723 --> 00:22:12,790
 

00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,892
Can I see that, please?

00:22:14,892 --> 00:22:14,958
 

00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,927
Why wouldn't you have taken
a purchase order

00:22:16,927 --> 00:22:16,994
 

00:22:16,994 --> 00:22:18,829
from anybody on this list?

00:22:18,829 --> 00:22:18,896
 

00:22:18,896 --> 00:22:20,798
I don't have working capital
to supply that.

00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:20,864
 

00:22:20,864 --> 00:22:23,000
If I got a check in advance,
I could seal the deal.

00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,066
 

00:22:23,066 --> 00:22:25,669
Are you gonna work
full-time on this?

00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:25,736
 

00:22:25,736 --> 00:22:27,738
If I'm able to, absolutely.
What does that mean?

00:22:27,738 --> 00:22:27,805
 

00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:29,106
You need a salary?
Something's gotta
pay the bills.

00:22:29,106 --> 00:22:29,173
 

00:22:29,173 --> 00:22:31,675
And the bombs,
I'd rather not do.

00:22:31,675 --> 00:22:31,742
 

00:22:31,742 --> 00:22:34,945
How much money would you need
to make it a full-time job?

00:22:34,945 --> 00:22:35,012
 

00:22:35,012 --> 00:22:36,680
Past mortgage and bills...

00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:36,747
 

00:22:36,747 --> 00:22:38,749
Let's say it's, uh,
$2,000, $3,000.
A month?

00:22:38,749 --> 00:22:38,816
 

00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:39,783
A month.
Okay.

00:22:39,783 --> 00:22:39,850
 

00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,753
So this is what
the list is worth...

00:22:42,753 --> 00:22:42,820
 

00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:46,757
when I started,
<i>everybody </i>said they wanted it,

00:22:46,757 --> 00:22:46,824
 

00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,892
but nobody wrote a check.

00:22:48,892 --> 00:22:48,959
 

00:22:48,959 --> 00:22:51,895
You're asking to value a company
at half a million dollars,

00:22:51,895 --> 00:22:51,962
 

00:22:51,962 --> 00:22:53,764
and then also to teach you.

00:22:53,764 --> 00:22:53,831
 

00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:56,733
I won't have the time
to help you. I'm out.

00:22:56,733 --> 00:22:59,736
 

00:22:59,736 --> 00:23:03,006
Jay, how much do you have
in inventory right now?

00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:03,073
 

00:23:03,073 --> 00:23:04,708
62 units.

00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:04,775
 

00:23:04,775 --> 00:23:07,778
Jay, look, the math
is not adding up for me.

00:23:07,778 --> 00:23:07,845
 

00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:10,781
You've had these same
exact challenges for four years,

00:23:10,781 --> 00:23:10,848
 

00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,816
and nothing has changed.

00:23:12,816 --> 00:23:12,883
 

00:23:12,883 --> 00:23:15,018
I'm not saying
you're not working hard.

00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:15,085
 

00:23:15,085 --> 00:23:18,722
Maybe it's just that
you're not working smart.

00:23:18,722 --> 00:23:18,789
 

00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:19,790
I'm out.

00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:22,760
 

00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,961
Mark is right.

00:23:23,961 --> 00:23:24,027
 

00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:26,797
You're running faster every day
and you're standing still.

00:23:26,797 --> 00:23:26,864
 

00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:28,065
You're not getting anywhere.

00:23:28,065 --> 00:23:28,132
 

00:23:28,132 --> 00:23:30,667
I don't have
a problem with that.

00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:30,734
 

00:23:30,734 --> 00:23:32,035
That was me.
I didn't know what to do.

00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:32,102
 

00:23:32,102 --> 00:23:34,138
I learned from others.

00:23:34,138 --> 00:23:34,204
 

00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:37,941
It's gonna suck up
<i>a lot </i>of my time,

00:23:37,941 --> 00:23:38,008
 

00:23:38,008 --> 00:23:41,845
but here's what I'll do--

00:23:41,845 --> 00:23:41,912
 

00:23:41,912 --> 00:23:44,014
I'll give you the $50,000

00:23:44,014 --> 00:23:44,081
 

00:23:44,081 --> 00:23:46,116
for 75%.

00:23:46,116 --> 00:23:50,020
 

00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,755
You just need some guidance,
my friend.

00:23:51,755 --> 00:23:51,822
 

00:23:51,822 --> 00:23:53,123
I think you're on
the right track.

00:23:53,123 --> 00:23:53,190
 

00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,125
Okay, the offer
Robert is making you

00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:55,192
 

00:23:55,192 --> 00:23:57,795
is the kind of offer
they made in medieval times,

00:23:57,795 --> 00:23:57,861
 

00:23:57,861 --> 00:24:00,030
when robber barons
roamed the land

00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:00,097
 

00:24:00,097 --> 00:24:02,065
and stole people's
companies from them.

00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:02,132
 

00:24:02,132 --> 00:24:05,869
75% gone.

00:24:05,869 --> 00:24:05,936
 

00:24:05,936 --> 00:24:07,037
I'm gonna make you
an offer.

00:24:07,037 --> 00:24:10,073
 

00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:12,843
I'm gonna give you
the $50,000,

00:24:12,843 --> 00:24:12,910
 

00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,211
and I don't want
any equity in it, okay?

00:24:14,211 --> 00:24:16,146
 

00:24:16,146 --> 00:24:17,881
I'd like to get
a royalty on the top

00:24:17,881 --> 00:24:17,948
 

00:24:17,948 --> 00:24:19,683
of every one sold.

00:24:19,683 --> 00:24:19,750
 

00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,719
I want 12%, and I'll give you
your $50,000.

00:24:22,719 --> 00:24:22,786
 

00:24:22,786 --> 00:24:24,721
Frankly, I'd rather do this

00:24:24,721 --> 00:24:24,788
 

00:24:24,788 --> 00:24:26,757
than see you
blown up with mines.

00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:26,824
 

00:24:26,824 --> 00:24:28,192
I would rather
be doing that, too.

00:24:28,192 --> 00:24:30,928
 

00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:33,030
How much do you want this?

00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:33,097
 

00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:34,064
Really bad.

00:24:34,064 --> 00:24:34,131
 

00:24:34,131 --> 00:24:37,067
This buckle can continue
to leech along

00:24:37,067 --> 00:24:37,134
 

00:24:37,134 --> 00:24:39,002
and--And snail
its way through,

00:24:39,002 --> 00:24:39,069
 

00:24:39,069 --> 00:24:40,904
or it can just boom.

00:24:40,904 --> 00:24:40,971
 

00:24:40,971 --> 00:24:42,106
Let's go
to sporting goods stores,

00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:42,172
 

00:24:42,172 --> 00:24:44,808
and say it's another accessory
while you fish.

00:24:44,808 --> 00:24:44,875
 

00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:46,009
It has other avenues,

00:24:46,009 --> 00:24:46,076
 

00:24:46,076 --> 00:24:47,845
so let's open those up.

00:24:47,845 --> 00:24:47,911
 

00:24:47,911 --> 00:24:49,880
You know, Jay, I'm jumping in,

00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,150
 

00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,985
and I'll do it for 51%

00:24:54,985 --> 00:24:55,052
 

00:24:55,052 --> 00:24:56,687
to knock him
out of the box,

00:24:56,687 --> 00:24:56,753
 

00:24:56,753 --> 00:24:57,988
'cause he's overeating
and he's greedy.

00:24:57,988 --> 00:24:58,055
 

00:24:58,055 --> 00:24:59,857
Last thing I am is greedy.

00:24:59,857 --> 00:24:59,923
 

00:24:59,923 --> 00:25:02,126
But you cannot take a salary
from that $50,000,

00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:02,192
 

00:25:02,192 --> 00:25:04,862
simply 'cause the math
doesn't work.
Well, what's he gonna live on?

00:25:04,862 --> 00:25:04,928
 

00:25:04,928 --> 00:25:08,932
I think that's insane,
that you would give up 75%.

00:25:08,932 --> 00:25:08,999
 

00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:10,734
I do, too.
It's crazy.

00:25:10,734 --> 00:25:10,801
 

00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:12,770
What for?
That's just crazy.

00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:12,836
 

00:25:12,836 --> 00:25:15,105
I wouldn't even listen
to that noise.

00:25:15,105 --> 00:25:15,172
 

00:25:15,172 --> 00:25:17,741
What, you're saying
your offer is better, O'Leary?

00:25:17,741 --> 00:25:17,808
 

00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:19,009
The problem with
that offer is,

00:25:19,009 --> 00:25:19,076
 

00:25:19,076 --> 00:25:21,712
when you're growing a business,
the last thing you want to do

00:25:21,712 --> 00:25:21,779
 

00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:24,882
is send 12% of the cash flow
out the business.

00:25:24,882 --> 00:25:24,948
 

00:25:24,948 --> 00:25:26,116
You're here
because you need cash.

00:25:26,116 --> 00:25:26,183
 

00:25:26,183 --> 00:25:28,752
Jay, I want you
to take a coffee cup

00:25:28,752 --> 00:25:28,819
 

00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,120
and put it right there
on your belt buckle,

00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:30,187
 

00:25:30,187 --> 00:25:32,022
'cause coffee is
for closers.

00:25:32,022 --> 00:25:32,089
 

00:25:32,089 --> 00:25:34,758
I want you to close on
one of those guys right now.

00:25:34,758 --> 00:25:34,825
 

00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:37,027
Make a decision.

00:25:37,027 --> 00:25:37,094
 

00:25:37,094 --> 00:25:38,896
What are you gonna do?

00:25:38,896 --> 00:25:42,032
 

00:25:42,032 --> 00:25:43,801
Life is full of choices.

00:25:43,801 --> 00:25:45,836
 

00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:47,037
You gotta pick one,
my friend.

00:25:47,037 --> 00:25:50,741
 

00:25:50,741 --> 00:25:54,077
I think the best person
to come into business with...

00:25:54,077 --> 00:25:54,144
 

00:25:54,144 --> 00:25:56,847
to be honest with you,
I think Barbara.

00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:56,914
 

00:25:56,914 --> 00:25:58,849
You're a smart guy.

00:25:58,849 --> 00:25:59,950
 

00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:01,051
You made a mistake,
my friend.

00:26:01,051 --> 00:26:01,118
 

00:26:01,118 --> 00:26:02,052
Good decision.
Thank you very much.

00:26:02,052 --> 00:26:02,119
 

00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:03,053

Thank you.

00:26:03,053 --> 00:26:03,120
 

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,087

00:26:04,087 --> 00:26:04,154
 

00:26:04,154 --> 00:26:06,990
You gave up control
of your company.

00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:07,057
 

00:26:07,057 --> 00:26:08,659
Thank you, all.

00:26:25,866 --> 00:26:29,266
<i>who feels he has reinvigorated</i>
<i>the ancient art of massage.</i>

00:26:29,266 --> 00:26:35,367
 

00:26:35,367 --> 00:26:36,301
Hello, sharks.

00:26:36,301 --> 00:26:36,368
 

00:26:36,368 --> 00:26:37,869
My name is Todd Miller.

00:26:37,869 --> 00:26:37,936
 

00:26:37,936 --> 00:26:39,938
I'm a licensed massage therapist

00:26:39,938 --> 00:26:40,005
 

00:26:40,005 --> 00:26:42,841
and founder of
the bodywalking institute.

00:26:42,841 --> 00:26:42,907
 

00:26:42,907 --> 00:26:45,810
I am here today
asking for $100,000

00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:45,877
 

00:26:45,877 --> 00:26:48,980
in exchange for 10% equity
in my company.

00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,047
 

00:26:49,047 --> 00:26:52,250
I have a product,
I have a service,

00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:52,317
 

00:26:52,317 --> 00:26:57,155
that's going to revolutionize
the massage therapy industry.

00:26:57,155 --> 00:26:57,222
 

00:26:57,222 --> 00:26:58,923
Who loves a good massage?

00:26:58,923 --> 00:26:58,990
 

00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:01,860
Barbara. Mark.

00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:01,926
 

00:27:01,926 --> 00:27:03,828
A truly great
therapeutic massage

00:27:03,828 --> 00:27:03,895
 

00:27:03,895 --> 00:27:07,999
is all about applying as much
isolated pressure as possible.

00:27:07,999 --> 00:27:08,066
 

00:27:08,066 --> 00:27:10,835
Wouldn't it be smarter
to use our feet?

00:27:10,835 --> 00:27:10,902
 

00:27:10,902 --> 00:27:14,839
That's why I have
created bodywalking.

00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:14,906
 

00:27:14,906 --> 00:27:17,042
By standing on you,

00:27:17,042 --> 00:27:17,108
 

00:27:17,108 --> 00:27:19,244
I am able to limit
blood flow temporarily.

00:27:19,244 --> 00:27:19,311
 

00:27:19,311 --> 00:27:21,112
When I come off
that area,

00:27:21,112 --> 00:27:21,179
 

00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:24,182
the blood shoots back in there
like a tsunami.

00:27:24,182 --> 00:27:24,249
 

00:27:24,249 --> 00:27:26,952
It feels incredible.

00:27:26,952 --> 00:27:27,018
 

00:27:27,018 --> 00:27:30,021
I'm able to apply
more pounds per square inch,

00:27:30,021 --> 00:27:30,088
 

00:27:30,088 --> 00:27:34,292
which causes the body
to just let go.

00:27:34,292 --> 00:27:34,359
 

00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:37,062
I invite one of you to come over
here and experience bodywalking.

00:27:37,062 --> 00:27:37,128
 

00:27:37,128 --> 00:27:39,030
Barbara, please come.
I have so much pain

00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:39,097
 

00:27:39,097 --> 00:27:41,199
sitting next to this character
for three years.

00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:41,266
 

00:27:41,266 --> 00:27:43,034
If you just turn your head
to one side or the other,

00:27:43,034 --> 00:27:43,101
 

00:27:43,101 --> 00:27:44,102
whatever's comfortable.
Todd, please,

00:27:44,102 --> 00:27:44,169
 

00:27:44,169 --> 00:27:46,972
step on her head.
(laughs)

00:27:46,972 --> 00:27:47,038
 

00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:49,341
Mr. Wonderful's stress
is leaving your body.

00:27:49,341 --> 00:27:52,210
 

00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:54,846
Are you using
full force, Todd?

00:27:54,846 --> 00:27:54,913
 

00:27:54,913 --> 00:27:59,084
What I'm doing is applying
8 to 15 seconds of compression.

00:27:59,084 --> 00:27:59,150
 

00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:02,087
It's all about
listening to Barbara's body.

00:28:02,087 --> 00:28:02,153
 

00:28:02,153 --> 00:28:03,855
Todd, how much do you weigh?

00:28:03,855 --> 00:28:03,922
 

00:28:03,922 --> 00:28:05,123
I weigh 190, sir.

00:28:05,123 --> 00:28:05,190
 

00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:08,026
So you're putting 190 pounds
on her leg.

00:28:08,026 --> 00:28:08,093
 

00:28:08,093 --> 00:28:09,828
Barb, how does that feel?

00:28:09,828 --> 00:28:09,894
 

00:28:09,894 --> 00:28:12,063
I mean,
he is not a small guy.

00:28:12,063 --> 00:28:15,200
 

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,870
Barb?
(Robert laughs)

00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:18,937
 

00:28:18,937 --> 00:28:20,872
Rigor mortis is
starting to set in.

00:28:20,872 --> 00:28:20,939
 

00:28:20,939 --> 00:28:23,241
(Robert laughs)
Can you please
lift Barbara up?

00:28:23,241 --> 00:28:23,308
 

00:28:23,308 --> 00:28:24,943
How are you doing
down there?
(mark, ghoulish voice)
she's alive! She's alive!

00:28:24,943 --> 00:28:25,010
 

00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:27,078
My god, that was great.

00:28:27,078 --> 00:28:27,145
 

00:28:27,145 --> 00:28:28,280
I'm in contact with

00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:28,346
 

00:28:28,346 --> 00:28:31,116
the biggest massage therapy
clinic provider in the U.S.

00:28:31,116 --> 00:28:31,182
 

00:28:31,182 --> 00:28:32,150
710 outlets,

00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:32,217
 

00:28:32,217 --> 00:28:34,252
one certified bodywalker,

00:28:34,252 --> 00:28:34,319
 

00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:36,087
and they're $1,500 a head.

00:28:36,087 --> 00:28:36,154
 

00:28:36,154 --> 00:28:38,957
That's what you charge
to get certified? $1,500?

00:28:38,957 --> 00:28:39,024
 

00:28:39,024 --> 00:28:40,191
Yes, sir.
Todd, hang on.

00:28:40,191 --> 00:28:40,258
 

00:28:40,258 --> 00:28:41,926
People walk
on other people's back

00:28:41,926 --> 00:28:41,993
 

00:28:41,993 --> 00:28:44,129
for a massage for a <i>long </i>time.

00:28:44,129 --> 00:28:44,195
 

00:28:44,195 --> 00:28:47,098
(Barbara) It's not new,
obviously.
Absolutely not.

00:28:47,098 --> 00:28:47,165
 

00:28:47,165 --> 00:28:49,100
They've been doing it in Asia
for thousands of years.
Okay, so--

00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:49,167
 

00:28:49,167 --> 00:28:50,902
But it's a new angle
for Americans.

00:28:50,902 --> 00:28:50,969
 

00:28:50,969 --> 00:28:52,037
Is that what you're saying?
Yes.

00:28:52,037 --> 00:28:52,103
 

00:28:52,103 --> 00:28:53,271
How many certified bodywalkers
do you have?

00:28:53,271 --> 00:28:53,338
 

00:28:53,338 --> 00:28:54,973
30.

00:28:54,973 --> 00:28:55,040
 

00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,174
How long did it take you
to enlist those 30?

00:28:56,174 --> 00:28:56,241
 

00:28:56,241 --> 00:29:00,045
I've been doing--certifying
bodywalking since 2005.

00:29:00,045 --> 00:29:00,111
 

00:29:00,111 --> 00:29:04,015
So you're saying you basically,
uh, did 30 people...

00:29:04,015 --> 00:29:04,082
 

00:29:04,082 --> 00:29:05,984
in seven years.
In seven years?

00:29:05,984 --> 00:29:06,051
 

00:29:06,051 --> 00:29:07,886
Yes.

00:29:07,886 --> 00:29:07,953
 

00:29:07,953 --> 00:29:09,020
Four people a year?

00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:09,087
 

00:29:09,087 --> 00:29:10,088
Yes.

00:29:10,088 --> 00:29:10,155
 

00:29:10,155 --> 00:29:13,058
It's not sounding great, Todd.

00:29:13,058 --> 00:29:14,359
 

00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:16,861
I understand, Robert.
That's why I'm here.

00:29:16,861 --> 00:29:16,928
 

00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,930
The bottom line is, it works.

00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:18,997
 

00:29:18,997 --> 00:29:20,265
As a 20-time ironman
triathlete,

00:29:20,265 --> 00:29:20,332
 

00:29:20,332 --> 00:29:23,068
I would not be here
unless it was for bodywalking.

00:29:23,068 --> 00:29:23,134
 

00:29:23,134 --> 00:29:26,271
But, Todd, I can't send you
all over America doing massages.

00:29:26,271 --> 00:29:26,338
 

00:29:26,338 --> 00:29:28,873
You are correct, sir.

00:29:28,873 --> 00:29:28,940
 

00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,042
That's why if we have
ten classes a month--

00:29:31,042 --> 00:29:31,109
 

00:29:31,109 --> 00:29:32,277
Ten. Just ten--

00:29:32,277 --> 00:29:32,344
 

00:29:32,344 --> 00:29:34,980
and we have 20 people
in those classes,

00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:35,046
 

00:29:35,046 --> 00:29:36,247
that's revenue of $300,000.

00:29:36,247 --> 00:29:36,314
 

00:29:36,314 --> 00:29:38,249
When was the last time
you ran a triathlon?

00:29:38,249 --> 00:29:38,316
 

00:29:38,316 --> 00:29:40,018
Almost nine months ago.

00:29:40,018 --> 00:29:40,085
 

00:29:40,085 --> 00:29:41,820
And how much training
do you need to do

00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:41,886
 

00:29:41,886 --> 00:29:43,888
before you go into
a triathlon?

00:29:43,888 --> 00:29:43,955
 

00:29:43,955 --> 00:29:45,023
You're training every day.

00:29:45,023 --> 00:29:45,090
 

00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,191
Which is your passion?

00:29:46,191 --> 00:29:46,257
 

00:29:46,257 --> 00:29:47,859
Mark, I've been thinking
about that question

00:29:47,859 --> 00:29:47,926
 

00:29:47,926 --> 00:29:49,961
all freakin' season,

00:29:49,961 --> 00:29:50,028
 

00:29:50,028 --> 00:29:51,229
'cause I love your questions.

00:29:51,229 --> 00:29:51,296
 

00:29:51,296 --> 00:29:53,098
(laughs)
My passion is

00:29:53,098 --> 00:29:53,164
 

00:29:53,164 --> 00:29:55,867
to generate your return
on this investment

00:29:55,867 --> 00:29:55,934
 

00:29:55,934 --> 00:29:57,135
quicker than anybody's
ever done.

00:29:57,135 --> 00:29:57,202
 

00:29:57,202 --> 00:29:58,937
You haven't given me
an answer, Todd.

00:29:58,937 --> 00:29:59,004
 

00:29:59,004 --> 00:30:02,941
Everybody likes to talk about
following their passions,

00:30:02,941 --> 00:30:03,008
 

00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:06,177
when in reality, they should be
following their efforts.

00:30:06,177 --> 00:30:06,244
 

00:30:06,244 --> 00:30:09,848
Just the time you put
into the triathlon

00:30:09,848 --> 00:30:09,914
 

00:30:09,914 --> 00:30:11,316
is time that could be spent
selling,

00:30:11,316 --> 00:30:11,383
 

00:30:11,383 --> 00:30:13,084
creating new certifications.

00:30:13,084 --> 00:30:13,151
 

00:30:13,151 --> 00:30:17,289
It tells me that my money
and your money

00:30:17,289 --> 00:30:17,355
 

00:30:17,355 --> 00:30:20,091
is not your primary focus.

00:30:20,091 --> 00:30:20,158
 

00:30:20,158 --> 00:30:22,294
Mark, that's not fair.

00:30:22,294 --> 00:30:22,360
 

00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,162
It <i>is </i>fair,
because you know what?
No, it's not fair.

00:30:24,162 --> 00:30:24,229
 

00:30:24,229 --> 00:30:25,830
It <i>is </i>fair.
That's crap.
No, it's crap, mark.

00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:25,897
 

00:30:25,897 --> 00:30:28,133
(Robert speaks indistinctly)
Mark, that's crap.

00:30:28,133 --> 00:30:28,199
 

00:30:28,199 --> 00:30:29,868
I understand.
You think triathlon is

00:30:29,868 --> 00:30:29,934
 

00:30:29,934 --> 00:30:32,837
this gargantuous thing that
you have to do all the time.

00:30:32,837 --> 00:30:32,904
 

00:30:32,904 --> 00:30:35,040
It's what keeps me happy.
You <i>make </i>choices.

00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:35,106
 

00:30:35,106 --> 00:30:36,841
(Robert) No way, man.
This guy's not a quitter,
though, mark.

00:30:36,841 --> 00:30:36,908
 

00:30:36,908 --> 00:30:37,909
When I had my first company,

00:30:37,909 --> 00:30:37,976
 

00:30:37,976 --> 00:30:39,811
I went seven years
without a vacation.

00:30:39,811 --> 00:30:39,878
 

00:30:39,878 --> 00:30:41,212
Mark, you--
But my girlfriends--
When my girlfriend says,

00:30:41,212 --> 00:30:41,279
 

00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,314
"It's me or your company,"

00:30:42,314 --> 00:30:42,380
 

00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,916
my answer was,
"What was your name again?"

00:30:44,916 --> 00:30:44,983
 

00:30:44,983 --> 00:30:46,184
(Robert) Come on, mark.
(speaks indistinctly)

00:30:46,184 --> 00:30:46,251
 

00:30:46,251 --> 00:30:47,285
Yeah, I had my first business,
I went seven years without <i>food.</i>

00:30:47,285 --> 00:30:47,352
 

00:30:47,352 --> 00:30:49,020
But it doesn't matter.
But your choices

00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:49,087
 

00:30:49,087 --> 00:30:51,990
to distribute your effort
among multiple things...
I hear ya,

00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:52,057
 

00:30:52,057 --> 00:30:53,892
but if I'm not healthy,
I'm gonna get overweight.

00:30:53,892 --> 00:30:53,959
 

00:30:53,959 --> 00:30:55,260
I'm gonna be a problem
to this country.

00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:55,327
 

00:30:55,327 --> 00:30:57,896
I'm not interested
in investing in balance.

00:30:57,896 --> 00:30:57,963
 

00:30:57,963 --> 00:31:00,832
I'm interested in investing
in somebody whose sole focus

00:31:00,832 --> 00:31:00,899
 

00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:03,168
is to be a success
at their business.

00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:03,234
 

00:31:03,234 --> 00:31:05,937
And I don't see that in you,
so I'm out.

00:31:05,937 --> 00:31:07,339
 

00:31:07,339 --> 00:31:08,873
I have to tell you something.

00:31:08,873 --> 00:31:08,940
 

00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,141
I am the queen of massages,

00:31:10,141 --> 00:31:10,208
 

00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:12,043
and I really,
with all due respect,

00:31:12,043 --> 00:31:12,110
 

00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:15,914
do not find this unique
in any way.

00:31:15,914 --> 00:31:15,981
 

00:31:15,981 --> 00:31:17,015
I'm out.

00:31:17,015 --> 00:31:19,084
 

00:31:19,084 --> 00:31:20,251
I don't see anything
proprietary.

00:31:20,251 --> 00:31:20,318
 

00:31:20,318 --> 00:31:22,053
I mean, look--
It goes back to the numbers,

00:31:22,053 --> 00:31:22,120
 

00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,889
the potential of--
Potential is not sales, Todd.

00:31:24,889 --> 00:31:24,956
 

00:31:24,956 --> 00:31:27,926
10% of that market is
40,000 therapists.

00:31:27,926 --> 00:31:27,993
 

00:31:27,993 --> 00:31:30,161
Potential is not sales.

00:31:30,161 --> 00:31:32,297
 

00:31:32,297 --> 00:31:33,298
I'm out.

00:31:33,298 --> 00:31:35,200
 

00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,234
I don't think
you've done a good job

00:31:36,234 --> 00:31:36,301
 

00:31:36,301 --> 00:31:38,937
of telling us what the plan is
here today.

00:31:38,937 --> 00:31:39,004
 

00:31:39,004 --> 00:31:41,973
You haven't proven the model
to sell a product.

00:31:41,973 --> 00:31:42,040
 

00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,143
So for that reason,
I gotta walk. I'm out.

00:31:45,143 --> 00:31:47,312
 

00:31:47,312 --> 00:31:50,181
I'm a very simple man.
I just want to make money.

00:31:50,181 --> 00:31:50,248
 

00:31:50,248 --> 00:31:51,249
I'll listen to anybody

00:31:51,249 --> 00:31:51,316
 

00:31:51,316 --> 00:31:54,185
until I get to the point
where I realize,

00:31:54,185 --> 00:31:54,252
 

00:31:54,252 --> 00:31:55,887
I can't make any money,

00:31:55,887 --> 00:31:55,954
 

00:31:55,954 --> 00:31:57,122
and that's where I'm at now
with you.

00:31:57,122 --> 00:31:57,188
 

00:31:57,188 --> 00:31:58,223
So for that reason--

00:31:58,223 --> 00:31:58,290
 

00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,291
Mr. Wonderful, may I...

00:31:59,291 --> 00:31:59,357
 

00:31:59,357 --> 00:32:01,860
therapists run up to me
and thank me.

00:32:03,194 --> 00:32:03,261
 

00:32:03,261 --> 00:32:05,997
Todd, you're a dead man walking
to me. I'm out.

00:32:05,997 --> 00:32:09,334
 

00:32:09,334 --> 00:32:11,036
Okay. Thank you very much.

00:32:11,036 --> 00:32:11,102

All the best.
Thank you very much.

00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:17,825
 

00:33:17,825 --> 00:33:20,762

00:34:08,943 --> 00:34:09,010
 

00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:11,646
We launched the product
about six months ago.

00:34:11,646 --> 00:34:11,712
 

00:34:11,712 --> 00:34:12,713
Why we're here is,

00:34:12,713 --> 00:34:12,780
 

00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,049
we have weaknesses
for big box distribution

00:34:15,049 --> 00:34:15,116
 

00:34:15,116 --> 00:34:16,918
and the retail stores.

00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:16,984
 

00:34:16,984 --> 00:34:18,786
Oh, so you want help in getting
retail distribution?

00:34:18,786 --> 00:34:18,853
 

00:34:18,853 --> 00:34:19,854
Correct.
Correct.

00:34:19,854 --> 00:34:19,921
 

00:34:19,921 --> 00:34:22,056
Does this eradicate
all of the bedbugs?

00:34:22,056 --> 00:34:22,123
 

00:34:22,123 --> 00:34:23,925
This has been designed,
actually,

00:34:23,925 --> 00:34:23,991
 

00:34:23,991 --> 00:34:25,126
as an early detection system.

00:34:25,126 --> 00:34:25,193
 

00:34:25,193 --> 00:34:26,994
Is your vision that I would
go to a hotel

00:34:26,994 --> 00:34:27,061
 

00:34:27,061 --> 00:34:28,730
with one of these...
correct.

00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:28,796
 

00:34:28,796 --> 00:34:30,765
Put it under my bed, and say,
"Whoa!"

00:34:30,765 --> 00:34:30,832
 

00:34:30,832 --> 00:34:32,100
Correct.
"I gotta change rooms.
There's bugs in here"?

00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:32,166
 

00:34:32,166 --> 00:34:33,935
we've actually
even had that happen.

00:34:33,935 --> 00:34:34,001
 

00:34:34,001 --> 00:34:35,903
Whoa.
Everyone keeps asking
the same question--

00:34:35,903 --> 00:34:35,970
 

00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:37,739
"Why are we so infested?"

00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:37,805
 

00:34:37,805 --> 00:34:41,676
Because there is no really good
early detection system.
Early detection.

00:34:41,676 --> 00:34:41,743
 

00:34:41,743 --> 00:34:44,045
Is it tested and proven
or is this your claim?

00:34:44,045 --> 00:34:44,112
 

00:34:44,112 --> 00:34:45,713
Yes, it's--We've tested it.

00:34:45,713 --> 00:34:45,780
 

00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,749
We worked with a couple
entomologists, dermatologists,

00:34:47,749 --> 00:34:47,815
 

00:34:47,815 --> 00:34:49,951
as well as myself.
Came up with a formula.

00:34:49,951 --> 00:34:50,017
 

00:34:50,017 --> 00:34:52,687
We just had a housing authority,
for instance.

00:34:52,687 --> 00:34:52,754
 

00:34:52,754 --> 00:34:54,655
We sent them a case
of 144 traps,

00:34:54,655 --> 00:34:54,722
 

00:34:54,722 --> 00:34:56,758
at their request for a sample,
three months ago.

00:34:56,758 --> 00:34:56,824
 

00:34:56,824 --> 00:34:58,960
They just placed an order
last week for 22,000 traps

00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,026
 

00:34:59,026 --> 00:35:00,695
because of
the successful results.

00:35:00,695 --> 00:35:00,762
 

00:35:00,762 --> 00:35:02,797
(Robert) Wow. It's not toxic
in any way? I mean...

00:35:02,797 --> 00:35:02,864
 

00:35:02,864 --> 00:35:05,032
No, it's nontoxic
and pesticide-Free.

00:35:05,032 --> 00:35:05,099
 

00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:08,903
BuggyBeds is patented
as a design in 34 countries.

00:35:08,903 --> 00:35:08,970
 

00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:12,006

00:35:16,644 --> 00:35:16,711
 

00:35:16,711 --> 00:35:18,713
(Kevin) Who is actually doing
the manufacturing for you?

00:35:18,713 --> 00:35:18,780
 

00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,815
We're actually taking it
in-house now 100%.

00:35:20,815 --> 00:35:20,882
 

00:35:20,882 --> 00:35:23,818
It's very cost effective
and easy.

00:35:23,818 --> 00:35:23,885
 

00:35:23,885 --> 00:35:25,820
What is the suggested
retail price of each of those?

00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:25,887
 

00:35:25,887 --> 00:35:28,990
The 2-packs are, uh,
$6.99 to $8.99.

00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:29,056
 

00:35:29,056 --> 00:35:31,058
And what is your cost
of making it?

00:35:31,058 --> 00:35:31,125
 

00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:32,894
$1.35.

00:35:32,894 --> 00:35:32,960
 

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,995
What are your sales right now?

00:35:33,995 --> 00:35:34,061
 

00:35:34,061 --> 00:35:36,064
Uh, currently,
our sales are $150,000.

00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:36,130
 

00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:38,633
We started with
Home Depot's web site,

00:35:38,633 --> 00:35:38,699
 

00:35:38,699 --> 00:35:40,835
and they just picked us up
for 60 of their stores

00:35:40,835 --> 00:35:40,902
 

00:35:40,902 --> 00:35:42,670
that we just shipped out
this week.

00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:42,737
 

00:35:42,737 --> 00:35:43,905
Whoa! You never said that
before.

00:35:43,905 --> 00:35:43,971
 

00:35:43,971 --> 00:35:45,039
With this product?
Correct.

00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:45,106
 

00:35:45,106 --> 00:35:46,841
We also just got
a purchase order from

00:35:46,841 --> 00:35:46,908
 

00:35:46,908 --> 00:35:49,644
75 Burlington Coat Factories
as well.

00:35:49,644 --> 00:35:49,710
 

00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,912
Can I say one other thing?

00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:50,978
 

00:35:50,978 --> 00:35:53,848
On the $150,000 in sales,
we have $100,000 in profit.

00:35:53,848 --> 00:35:53,915
 

00:35:53,915 --> 00:35:54,916
<i>Nice.</i>

00:35:54,916 --> 00:35:54,982
 

00:35:54,982 --> 00:35:55,917
For six months
since you've introduced it?

00:35:55,917 --> 00:35:55,983
 

00:35:55,983 --> 00:35:57,618
Correct.

00:35:57,618 --> 00:35:57,685
 

00:35:57,685 --> 00:35:59,120
$150,000 for 6 months.
You're valuing the company--

00:35:59,120 --> 00:35:59,187
 

00:35:59,187 --> 00:36:02,657
You're asking for $125,000
for 7%, correct?

00:36:02,657 --> 00:36:02,723
 

00:36:02,723 --> 00:36:04,058
Correct.

00:36:04,058 --> 00:36:04,125
 

00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:06,694
You're saying the company's
valued around $1.75 million.

00:36:06,694 --> 00:36:06,761
 

00:36:06,761 --> 00:36:08,062
Why are you valuing the company
at that?

00:36:08,062 --> 00:36:08,129
 

00:36:08,129 --> 00:36:09,864
That's a great question.

00:36:09,864 --> 00:36:09,931
 

00:36:09,931 --> 00:36:11,999
Before we launched,
I was offered $5 million

00:36:11,999 --> 00:36:12,066
 

00:36:12,066 --> 00:36:13,935
for the trademarks
and the patent from a company.

00:36:13,935 --> 00:36:14,001
 

00:36:14,001 --> 00:36:15,636
(sharks) Whoa!

00:36:15,636 --> 00:36:15,703
 

00:36:15,703 --> 00:36:17,638
Wait a minute.
And you turned that down?

00:36:17,638 --> 00:36:17,705
 

00:36:17,705 --> 00:36:19,040
Yes.

00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,107
 

00:36:19,107 --> 00:36:20,775
What?!

00:36:20,775 --> 00:36:20,842
 

00:36:20,842 --> 00:36:21,943
Shame on you!

00:36:21,943 --> 00:36:22,009
 

00:36:22,009 --> 00:36:24,078
Are you... uh...

00:36:24,078 --> 00:36:24,145
 

00:36:24,145 --> 00:36:25,713
I'm Mrs. Wonderful of business.

00:36:25,713 --> 00:36:25,780
 

00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,015
I know what we have here.
I know the value.

00:36:28,015 --> 00:36:28,082
 

00:36:28,082 --> 00:36:30,752
We did a test market
in 29 stores of shoprite.

00:36:30,752 --> 00:36:30,818
 

00:36:30,818 --> 00:36:31,886
They contacted us.

00:36:31,886 --> 00:36:31,953
 

00:36:31,953 --> 00:36:34,922
The entire corporation sold out
in 10 days in 29 stores.

00:36:34,922 --> 00:36:34,989
 

00:36:34,989 --> 00:36:36,891
We just had a Walmart
local manager look at it.

00:36:36,891 --> 00:36:36,958
 

00:36:36,958 --> 00:36:38,893
The first thing said is,
"Wow! This is eye candy.

00:36:38,893 --> 00:36:38,960
 

00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,862
You can have it--have it
in front of the register."

00:36:40,862 --> 00:36:40,928
 

00:36:40,928 --> 00:36:42,697
I like her. (laughs)

00:36:42,697 --> 00:36:42,764
 

00:36:42,764 --> 00:36:43,998
Wow. You two bedbugs are
the real deal.

00:36:43,998 --> 00:36:44,065
 

00:36:44,065 --> 00:36:46,768
I-I think we know you guys are
the real deal.

00:36:46,768 --> 00:36:46,834
 

00:36:46,834 --> 00:36:47,935
I'm itching to do this deal.

00:36:47,935 --> 00:36:48,002
 

00:36:48,002 --> 00:36:49,804

00:36:49,804 --> 00:36:49,871

Okay. Ladies, ladies,

00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:51,706
 

00:36:51,706 --> 00:36:53,708
I want you to step outside
for me, okay?

00:36:53,708 --> 00:36:53,775
 

00:36:53,775 --> 00:36:56,778
Because I want us to have
a little shark discussion, okay?
Uh-Oh.

00:36:56,778 --> 00:36:59,180
 

00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,915
Okay, boys and girl,

00:37:00,915 --> 00:37:00,982
 

00:37:00,982 --> 00:37:03,651
we all want part of this deal.

00:37:03,651 --> 00:37:03,718
 

00:37:03,718 --> 00:37:04,786
So what do you want
to go up to?

00:37:04,786 --> 00:37:04,852
 

00:37:04,852 --> 00:37:07,655
I'd like to see
what they're offering.

00:37:07,655 --> 00:37:07,722
 

00:37:07,722 --> 00:37:08,923
I think they're very interested
and I think they're gonna--

00:37:08,923 --> 00:37:08,990
 

00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:10,024
Depends on what value they're
gonna bring to the table.

00:37:10,024 --> 00:37:10,091
 

00:37:10,091 --> 00:37:11,759
Yeah.
I mean, it depends--

00:37:11,759 --> 00:37:11,826
 

00:37:11,826 --> 00:37:12,860
You know, I'm not gonna give up
something what we have.

00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:12,927
 

00:37:12,927 --> 00:37:14,695
We have tremendous value.
Right.

00:37:14,695 --> 00:37:14,762
 

00:37:14,762 --> 00:37:17,865

00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:19,734

00:37:21,002 --> 00:37:21,069
 

00:37:21,069 --> 00:37:23,771
She turned down $5 million.
Yeah, she turned down
$5 million.

00:37:23,771 --> 00:37:23,838
 

00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:24,839

about the dollars

00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:24,906
 

00:37:24,906 --> 00:37:26,741

So what would really

00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:28,366
 

00:38:28,366 --> 00:38:30,235

00:38:30,235 --> 00:38:30,302
 

00:38:30,302 --> 00:38:32,304

00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:38,510
 

00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,212

a little higher

00:39:01,185 --> 00:39:01,252
 

00:39:01,252 --> 00:39:03,053

00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:07,925
'cause it's strategic,
it's the same equity.

00:39:07,925 --> 00:39:07,992
 

00:39:07,992 --> 00:39:09,093

00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,195
I've lived through rolling out
products in Walmart.

00:39:11,195 --> 00:39:11,262
 

00:39:11,262 --> 00:39:13,864
It's very hard.
I wanna help you.

00:39:13,864 --> 00:39:13,931
 

00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:15,166
7-Eleven has 40,000 stores
globally,

00:39:15,166 --> 00:39:15,232
 

00:39:15,232 --> 00:39:16,934
so I can help you with that.

00:39:16,934 --> 00:39:17,001
 

00:39:17,001 --> 00:39:19,136
I wanna speak for the value
we bring beyond just the cash.

00:39:19,136 --> 00:39:19,203
 

00:39:19,203 --> 00:39:22,173
I mean, there's a lot of value
in having us as partners.

00:39:22,173 --> 00:39:22,239
 

00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:23,974
We have to get paid for that,
too.

00:39:23,974 --> 00:39:24,041
 

00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:25,876
Everybody has to wet their beak.

00:39:25,876 --> 00:39:25,943
 

00:39:25,943 --> 00:39:27,011
Mark, are you in on this?

00:39:27,011 --> 00:39:27,077
 

00:39:27,077 --> 00:39:28,112
I have nothing to say.

00:39:28,112 --> 00:39:29,246
 

00:39:29,246 --> 00:39:31,749
Can we just discuss
what you would be bringing

00:39:31,749 --> 00:39:31,816
 

00:39:31,816 --> 00:39:33,951
as far as other help
you can give us?

00:39:33,951 --> 00:39:34,018
 

00:39:34,018 --> 00:39:35,853
For starters, they would bring
their huge egos with them.

00:39:35,853 --> 00:39:35,920
 

00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,954
It...

00:39:36,954 --> 00:39:37,021
 

00:39:37,021 --> 00:39:39,190
Ladies, I'm gonna give you
an offer now.

00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:39,256
 

00:39:39,256 --> 00:39:42,993
You have to accept it now.
All right? I'm not gonna wait.

00:39:42,993 --> 00:39:43,060
 

00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,895
I don't have time
for the little boy games.

00:39:44,895 --> 00:39:44,962
 

00:39:44,962 --> 00:39:49,934
So I'm gonna give you $150,000
for 15% of the business.

00:39:49,934 --> 00:39:50,000
 

00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,069
But I'm gonna tell you what
I'm gonna bring to the table.

00:39:52,069 --> 00:39:52,136
 

00:39:52,136 --> 00:39:53,971
I had to learn how to break into
the big box stores.

00:39:53,971 --> 00:39:54,038
 

00:39:54,038 --> 00:39:55,840
I didn't know a darn thing
about it three years ago.

00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:55,906
 

00:39:55,906 --> 00:39:57,141
I know it inside and out.

00:39:57,141 --> 00:39:57,208
 

00:39:57,208 --> 00:39:59,910
But you know what else? You
girls are cut of the same cloth.

00:39:59,910 --> 00:39:59,977
 

00:39:59,977 --> 00:40:02,146
We don't need these boys
to help us find our success.

00:40:02,146 --> 00:40:02,213
 

00:40:02,213 --> 00:40:04,048
They weren't there
when we were struggling.

00:40:04,048 --> 00:40:04,115
 

00:40:04,115 --> 00:40:05,816
Girl power!
They're not gonna be there
at the end.

00:40:05,816 --> 00:40:05,883
 

00:40:05,883 --> 00:40:07,184
What is this?
And that's the truth. All right?

00:40:07,184 --> 00:40:07,251
 

00:40:07,251 --> 00:40:09,086
Barbara, let's just get to your
blood-sucking offer, please.

00:40:09,086 --> 00:40:09,153
 

00:40:09,153 --> 00:40:10,788
Reiterate it again.
All right.
And you wanna know what else?

00:40:10,788 --> 00:40:10,855
 

00:40:10,855 --> 00:40:12,156
(Kevin) is there an offer
at the end of this?

00:40:12,156 --> 00:40:12,223
 

00:40:12,223 --> 00:40:13,924
I already gave the offer.

00:40:13,924 --> 00:40:13,991
 

00:40:13,991 --> 00:40:14,992
Make sure the phone bill's
in there,

00:40:14,992 --> 00:40:15,059
 

00:40:15,059 --> 00:40:16,193
because as long-winded
as she is,

00:40:16,193 --> 00:40:16,260
 

00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,129
you will be on the phone
forever.
(Maria and Veronica laugh)

00:40:18,129 --> 00:40:18,195
 

00:40:18,195 --> 00:40:19,964
you realize
they're both giving you

00:40:19,964 --> 00:40:20,030
 

00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:22,199
basically the same value
of the company.
Correct.

00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:22,266
 

00:40:22,266 --> 00:40:25,035
Ladies, do you accept the offer
or not?

00:40:25,035 --> 00:40:25,102
 

00:40:25,102 --> 00:40:29,006
Keep in mind, Maria, you've got
the offer from Daymond and Kevin

00:40:29,006 --> 00:40:29,073
 

00:40:29,073 --> 00:40:31,041
for $250,000 for 25%,

00:40:31,041 --> 00:40:31,108
 

00:40:31,108 --> 00:40:34,979
and Mark and I haven't made
any offer yet.

00:40:34,979 --> 00:40:37,982
 

00:40:37,982 --> 00:40:40,217
Okay, So, Barbara,
are you in or out?

00:40:40,217 --> 00:40:40,284
 

00:40:40,284 --> 00:40:42,853
My offer's off the table.

00:40:42,853 --> 00:40:44,088
 

00:40:44,088 --> 00:40:45,156
I'm out.

00:40:45,156 --> 00:40:46,857
 

00:40:46,857 --> 00:40:48,225
Too bad.

00:40:48,225 --> 00:40:48,292
 

00:40:48,292 --> 00:40:49,960
I love your business.

00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,027
 

00:40:50,027 --> 00:40:52,997
You guys have everything
under control, basically.

00:40:52,997 --> 00:40:53,063
 

00:40:53,063 --> 00:40:54,165
The issue really is,

00:40:54,165 --> 00:40:54,231
 

00:40:54,231 --> 00:40:55,933
can you run fast enough
to keep up with everything?

00:40:55,933 --> 00:40:56,000
 

00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,968
Mm-hmm.
You have no idea.

00:40:57,968 --> 00:40:58,035
 

00:40:58,035 --> 00:41:01,906
I think the best deal is
for the four of us--

00:41:01,906 --> 00:41:01,972
 

00:41:01,972 --> 00:41:03,808
and actually, if Barbara wants
to come back in--

00:41:03,808 --> 00:41:03,874
 

00:41:03,874 --> 00:41:06,844
the five of us on the--
You're being a gentleman.

00:41:06,844 --> 00:41:06,911
 

00:41:06,911 --> 00:41:08,012
No, I'll leave the boys club
up to the boys.

00:41:08,012 --> 00:41:08,078
 

00:41:08,078 --> 00:41:11,215
The only reason I would, uh,
make my offer

00:41:11,215 --> 00:41:11,282
 

00:41:11,282 --> 00:41:13,184
is to screw over Mark Cuban.

00:41:13,184 --> 00:41:13,250
 

00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:14,852
Ha!

00:41:14,852 --> 00:41:14,919
 

00:41:14,919 --> 00:41:17,788
But I think each of us can
add something, as Mark said.

00:41:17,788 --> 00:41:17,855
 

00:41:17,855 --> 00:41:21,025
I'm in on the deal with Mark,
Daymond, and Kevin.

00:41:21,025 --> 00:41:21,092
 

00:41:21,092 --> 00:41:24,862
$250,000 for 25%.

00:41:24,862 --> 00:41:28,999
 

00:41:28,999 --> 00:41:30,968
(Kevin) Come on, Barbara.
Barbara, you should come in.

00:41:30,968 --> 00:41:33,003
 

00:41:33,003 --> 00:41:34,138
I'm gonna tell you something.

00:41:34,138 --> 00:41:34,205
 

00:41:34,205 --> 00:41:35,906
I don't even like these guys,

00:41:35,906 --> 00:41:35,973
 

00:41:35,973 --> 00:41:38,876
But just to make
your life pleasant,

00:41:38,876 --> 00:41:38,943
 

00:41:38,943 --> 00:41:40,211
I'm gonna jump back in the deal.

00:41:40,211 --> 00:41:40,277
 

00:41:40,277 --> 00:41:42,012
Before she changes her mind,
you have all five sharks,

00:41:42,012 --> 00:41:42,079
 

00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:43,147
quarter of a million dollars

00:41:43,147 --> 00:41:43,214
 

00:41:43,214 --> 00:41:44,849
for 25% of the company.

00:41:44,849 --> 00:41:44,915
 

00:41:44,915 --> 00:41:45,916
Never happens <i>ever.</i>

00:41:45,916 --> 00:41:45,983
 

00:41:45,983 --> 00:41:47,818
Yes or no?
Okay, can we take on minute to--

00:41:47,818 --> 00:41:47,885
 

00:41:47,885 --> 00:41:49,286
No.
(Kevin and Barbara)
Don't even think about it.

00:41:49,286 --> 00:41:55,960
 

00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,161
I have one request.

00:41:57,161 --> 00:41:57,228
 

00:41:57,228 --> 00:41:59,797
Will you teach me
the Cha-Cha-Cha?

00:41:59,797 --> 00:41:59,864
 

00:41:59,864 --> 00:42:00,965
(laughs) It's a deal.
(laughs)

00:42:00,965 --> 00:42:01,031
 

00:42:01,031 --> 00:42:02,900
It's a deal.
Wow!

00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:02,967
 

00:42:02,967 --> 00:42:03,968
(Daymond) That is history.
(Kevin) Wow!

00:42:03,968 --> 00:42:04,034
 

00:42:04,034 --> 00:42:05,169
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

00:42:05,169 --> 00:42:05,236
 

00:42:05,236 --> 00:42:07,071
Congratulations to you, guys.
You guys are gonna do great.

00:42:07,071 --> 00:42:07,138
 

00:42:07,138 --> 00:42:09,907
Now go back and sprinkle bedbugs
in every hotel

00:42:09,907 --> 00:42:09,974
 

00:42:09,974 --> 00:42:11,942
and restaurant you can.
(laughs)

00:42:11,942 --> 00:42:12,009
 

00:42:12,009 --> 00:42:13,043
Yes!

00:42:13,043 --> 00:42:13,110
 

00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:15,146
(laughs)

00:42:15,146 --> 00:42:15,212
 

00:42:15,212 --> 00:42:17,014
Yes!
We did it, baby!

00:42:17,014 --> 00:42:17,081
 

00:42:17,081 --> 00:42:18,883
All five of them. Whoo-Hoo!

00:42:18,883 --> 00:42:18,949
 

00:42:18,949 --> 00:42:20,951
Barbara, your greed almost
killed that deal for all of us.

00:42:20,951 --> 00:42:21,018
 

00:42:21,018 --> 00:42:21,986
Yeah, you're a savage.

00:42:21,986 --> 00:42:22,052
 

00:42:22,052 --> 00:42:23,754
Bedbugs--My best friends.

00:42:23,754 --> 00:42:23,821
 

00:42:23,821 --> 00:42:25,055
They're your relatives.

00:42:25,055 --> 00:42:25,122
 

00:42:25,122 --> 00:42:27,925
Well, it's a great business.

00:42:27,925 --> 00:42:27,992
 

00:42:27,992 --> 00:42:31,061
Having all five sharks get in
the deal together

00:42:31,061 --> 00:42:31,128
 

00:42:31,128 --> 00:42:32,797
was <i>amazing</i>
for it to ever happen.

00:42:32,797 --> 00:42:32,863
 

00:42:32,863 --> 00:42:34,131
That's tremendous for us.

00:42:34,131 --> 00:42:34,198
 

00:42:34,198 --> 00:42:37,201
 

00:42:37,201 --> 00:42:40,701
