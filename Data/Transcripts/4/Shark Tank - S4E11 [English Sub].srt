00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,000
dream of a chance
to secure an investment

Look, I don't--I don't want
to be a grinch.

00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,320
If the sharks hear
a great idea,

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,270
they're ready to invest
using their own money.

00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,080
So greedy on this one.

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,450

they just said.

Did you really
just say that?

00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,100
But first the entrepreneurs
must convince a shark

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,400
to invest the full amount
they're asking for

00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,180

with nothing.

From the ground up,

00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,280
we got a business loan--

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,370
That's how we got our money--

00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,300
And we had a loan
for $125,000.

00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,480
And that includes
all the lease--

00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,230
How much was it?

00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,320
$125,000.

00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,150
You built the entire space
for $125,000?

00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,350
We did a lot of work
ourselves.
We did a lot of it ourselves.

00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,120
(Mark)
Why not just use the profits

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,120
recycle them, and open up
another coop here in L.A.?

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,250
it's a big city.

00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,420

I mean, the Manual labor

00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:40,030
of actually having
a physical space--

00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,000
We're open seven days a week,
we're always there.

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,420
We're there every day.
(laughs)

00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,250

with franchises,

00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,370
maybe we could open 300.

00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,430
Okay.
(laughs)

00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,470

where we were looking at that.

00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,420
(Kevin) Look, ladies,

00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,400
on the way
to a successful franchise,

00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,230
if you look historically
at the ones who have done it--

00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:02,000
they take a geographic region
they can actually drive to,

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,150
set up 5 to 15 locations,

00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,150
learn how to manage them,

00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,400
and then say this model works,

00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,320
and then do 300 more.

00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,120
'cause I actually believe
that this could be franchisable.

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,030
But you gotta prove it, because
if I was gonna buy it from you,

00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,000
I'd say,
"you've got one location."

00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,370
For now...

00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,280
not an investment,
but, boy, I love your numbers

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,280
and I rarely say that

(laughs) It's True.

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,100
We're here because we're...

what we're asking for,

your money back

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,230
(Daymond)
You want $150,000.

00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,370
Is that all you want?
(Juliet and Lucinda) No.

00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:51,000
We want the expertise of
somebody who's a businessperson.

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,370
We're creative people.
We're moms.

We don't come from
the business world,

00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,020
and our business has exploded.

00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,450
Well, that has to be clear,
because, uh,

00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,230
you know, we're not here
to exploit people, so...

00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,470
Well, speak for yourself.

00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,050
All right.

00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,120
You would regret
having done the deal with me,

00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,450
because here, I wouldn't be able
to add any value

00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,120
and it'd just be money.

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,280
And I think that you guys
are rock stars,

00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,450

four or five of 'em,

00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,070

for you guys.

00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:18,030

the key to the success
of this business

00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,400
is the two of you guys.

00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,070
Very successful

00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,230
Open another one.

00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,200
I don't understand
why you haven't done that.

00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,070
You've got the energy
to open 20 of them.

Guys, let me
jump in real quick.

First, thank you
for the birthday.

00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,280
It's the best birthday
I've ever--
Oh, good.

00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,050
That I've had today.

00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,130
(laughs)

00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,420
Two issues. One...

00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,420
having been through a business
that's very personal

00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,150
and thinking that I had to have
my stamp on everything

00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,480
and knowing
how difficult it is

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,130
to just grow
those types of businesses,

00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,350
that's my first concern.

00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,100
My second concern is,

00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,370
there are so
many inexpensive alternatives

00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,120
that the hip, cool, different

00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,200
I think will work
in the major markets,

00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,200
but it's gonna be
very, very difficult

00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,450
to sell to middle America,

00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,220
even if you reduced
your prices.

00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,130
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,420
Four of the sharks

back within two years.

00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:04,977
(Donna) This chocolate--
(Barbara) mmm.

00:15:04,977 --> 00:15:06,817
I'll tell you why
it's so good.

00:15:06,817 --> 00:15:08,067
Years ago,

00:15:08,067 --> 00:15:09,927
I always wanted to be
in show business,

00:15:09,927 --> 00:15:12,827
and every time I didn't get
a part or something,

00:15:12,827 --> 00:15:14,197
instead of beat myself up,

00:15:14,197 --> 00:15:16,797
I would beat that chocolate.

00:15:16,797 --> 00:15:19,067
So I got really good
at making chocolate--

00:15:19,067 --> 00:15:21,177
years of not getting things
that I wanted.

00:15:21,177 --> 00:15:24,747
It was at my 60th birthday,
my whole family--

00:15:24,747 --> 00:15:26,897
Dougie, Donna, Dana, Debbie,
Dennis, Daryl, Danny,

00:15:26,897 --> 00:15:28,147
and Mary-Katherine--

00:15:28,147 --> 00:15:30,147
We all came to my party,
plus all my friends...

00:15:30,147 --> 00:15:31,897
(laughs)

00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:34,747
I gave them little goodie bags
because This is a special treat.

00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:36,747
Donna, I gotta know--
Mary-Katherine?

00:15:36,747 --> 00:15:37,967
Why not a "D"?

00:15:37,967 --> 00:15:39,967
my mother prayed
to the virgin Mary

00:15:39,967 --> 00:15:41,977
that she wouldn't have
any more kids,

00:15:41,977 --> 00:15:43,797
and if she didn't have
any more kids,

00:15:43,797 --> 00:15:44,997
she'd name it after her.
(laughs)

00:15:44,997 --> 00:15:47,897
So my older brother said to me
when he had that Fudge,

00:15:47,897 --> 00:15:49,927
he said,
"you should sell it."

00:15:49,927 --> 00:15:51,017
And he said,
"what would you call it?"

00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:52,867
and I said,
"I'll call it

00:15:52,867 --> 00:15:54,197
"what you
used to call me growing up--

00:15:54,197 --> 00:15:56,067
Fat ass."

00:15:56,067 --> 00:15:58,077
And that--That idea

00:15:58,077 --> 00:16:01,027
never left my mind.

00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:03,847
I saw it. I got, like, chills.

00:16:03,847 --> 00:16:06,167
I knew that
this would be a hit.

00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:08,077
I had a dream about you
last night.

00:16:08,077 --> 00:16:09,777
I'll have to tell you.

00:16:09,777 --> 00:16:11,917
(Robert) WHOA!
(Barbara) Whoa, baby.

00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:12,947
(laughs)

00:16:12,947 --> 00:16:14,197
No, I do. (laughs)

00:16:14,197 --> 00:16:17,097
I do. I do. I see it.

00:16:17,097 --> 00:16:19,077
Donna, you're scaring me.
You're scaring me.

00:16:19,077 --> 00:16:20,777
(both laughing)
Give us your numbers.

00:16:20,777 --> 00:16:21,877
Okay.

00:16:21,877 --> 00:16:25,077
I have a deal
with whole foods. Ta-Da!

00:16:25,077 --> 00:16:27,067
Let me just tell you
what's happening.

00:16:27,067 --> 00:16:29,797
(Robert) But do you have sales
in the last 12 months?

00:16:29,797 --> 00:16:31,047
Yes!
What are they?

00:16:31,047 --> 00:16:33,017
(laughs)
What are they?

00:16:33,017 --> 00:16:34,827
It's so exciting. Okay.

00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,197
(Kevin) Donna.
Yes.

00:16:36,197 --> 00:16:38,877
What are the sales
in the last 12 months?
How many dollars?

00:16:38,877 --> 00:16:39,917
Okay.

00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:41,217
$60,000.

00:16:41,217 --> 00:16:43,027
$60,000?

00:16:43,027 --> 00:16:45,027
I'm not as excited
as you were.

00:16:45,027 --> 00:16:46,877
What?
(Barbara) Oh, my God.

00:16:46,877 --> 00:16:48,077
That's not good?

00:16:48,077 --> 00:16:49,797
No! Donna.
Oh, my god.

00:16:49,797 --> 00:16:52,017
Donna, whatever you're on,
don't give it to Kevin.

00:16:52,017 --> 00:16:54,047
That's not good? Listen,
I'm just one person.

00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:55,867
(Robert) That's so low.

00:16:55,867 --> 00:16:56,947
Huh?
That's so low.

00:16:56,947 --> 00:16:58,047
No, listen--
listen to this--

00:16:58,047 --> 00:17:00,117
The name alone
is worth a million.

00:17:00,117 --> 00:17:03,847
Oh, can I just tell you
another really exciting thing?

00:17:03,847 --> 00:17:05,997
Now imagine me--
I'm in a farmers' market.

00:17:05,997 --> 00:17:07,117
This is where I started.

00:17:07,117 --> 00:17:09,127
All these people come out,

00:17:09,127 --> 00:17:11,217
and they wipe me out
of all my product,

00:17:11,217 --> 00:17:12,897
like in a wind whirl.

00:17:12,897 --> 00:17:15,127
The name brings them to me,

00:17:15,127 --> 00:17:17,147
But the taste keeps people
coming back.

00:17:17,147 --> 00:17:18,727
(Barbara) Ah.

00:17:18,727 --> 00:17:19,897
This is a brand.

00:17:19,897 --> 00:17:21,817
This has
endless possibilities.

00:17:23,217 --> 00:17:25,197
First off, I think
you're a great actress.

00:17:25,197 --> 00:17:27,027
Oh, thank you.
But what do you do?

00:17:27,027 --> 00:17:28,797
You're going from farmers'
market to farmers' market

00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,747
and selling your product
by yourself?

00:17:30,747 --> 00:17:32,747
Yes, and then
the second part of it--

00:17:32,747 --> 00:17:34,997
now that I'm in whole foods,
they're putting in orders,

00:17:34,997 --> 00:17:36,877
and there's another--
(Kevin)
When you say whole foods,

00:17:36,877 --> 00:17:38,767
you have one store
you're selling to?

00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:39,777
I have two stores.

00:17:39,777 --> 00:17:40,897
Do you have a purchase order?

00:17:40,897 --> 00:17:41,997
Yes! Oh. (laughs)

00:17:41,997 --> 00:17:43,077
For two stores?

00:17:43,077 --> 00:17:45,077
Can I say "Yes!"?
(laughs)

00:17:45,077 --> 00:17:46,867
(Barbara chuckles)

00:17:46,867 --> 00:17:48,067
♪ Hee-Hee-Whoo ♪
(Kevin) Here's the problem,
Donna.

00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,147
(laughs)

00:17:49,147 --> 00:17:50,927
'cause, you know, in the end,

00:17:50,927 --> 00:17:52,967
the reality is about money,
okay?

00:17:52,967 --> 00:17:54,147
I know.

00:17:54,147 --> 00:17:56,177
We're dealing with $60,000
in sales.

00:17:56,177 --> 00:17:58,877
I believe that probably
you're breaking even on that.

00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:00,197
Aren't we supposed to
negotiate, babe?

00:18:00,197 --> 00:18:02,167
Well, here's what--we'll start
the negotiation this way--

00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:05,947
I'll give you $250,000...

00:18:05,947 --> 00:18:08,927
for 1,000%
of fat ass Fudge.

00:18:08,927 --> 00:18:10,867
I'm--1,000%?

00:18:10,867 --> 00:18:12,727
But isn't that too much?

00:18:12,727 --> 00:18:13,817
1,000%?
(Robert) Oh, my god.

00:18:13,817 --> 00:18:14,927
Exactly my point.

00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,067
It's 1,000%.
It's, like, you know--

00:18:16,067 --> 00:18:18,797

and Barbara been friends?

00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,897
(sharks laugh)

00:18:20,897 --> 00:18:23,877
You don't think that I have
something special, honestly?

00:18:23,877 --> 00:18:27,017
I feel I can bring sweetness
and happiness to people

00:18:27,017 --> 00:18:30,917
and also I feel
I deserve my own tv show.

00:18:30,917 --> 00:18:32,917

00:18:32,917 --> 00:18:35,217

kidding me.

00:18:35,217 --> 00:18:36,847
(Kevin) You're interesting.

00:18:36,847 --> 00:18:38,917
The product is good.

00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,817
So that's what we have.
And that's all you--

00:18:40,817 --> 00:18:42,947
stirring it up in the kitchen,
packaging it, and selling it.

00:18:42,947 --> 00:18:45,027
If you want to make this
a big business,

00:18:45,027 --> 00:18:46,877
one that's worth
$5 million one day,

00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:49,027
you need a partner,
because you're nuts.

00:18:51,077 --> 00:18:53,847
In a nice way, I'm saying it.
You need a partner.

00:18:53,847 --> 00:18:55,777
You need somebody that says,
"listen, Donna,

00:18:55,777 --> 00:18:57,817
"you make the Fudge,
and I'm going to figure out

00:18:57,817 --> 00:18:59,797
how to make this
much bigger."

00:18:59,797 --> 00:19:01,767
That's what's missing
in your presentation.

00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:02,927
'cause every once in a while,
lightning strikes

00:19:02,927 --> 00:19:04,117
and somebody
dreams up a cookie

00:19:04,117 --> 00:19:06,097
or a piece of Fudge
with a crazy name,

00:19:06,097 --> 00:19:07,767
and they become rich.

00:19:07,767 --> 00:19:09,867
You're half-Baked right now.

00:19:09,867 --> 00:19:12,927
You're not fully cooked.
You need the other piece.

00:19:12,927 --> 00:19:15,047
You didn't bring it with you,
so unfortunately,

00:19:15,047 --> 00:19:18,067
Mr. Wonderful has to say...

00:19:18,067 --> 00:19:19,897
I'm out.

00:19:21,977 --> 00:19:23,777
Kevin, can I say to you...

00:19:23,777 --> 00:19:24,867
Please, Donna.

00:19:24,867 --> 00:19:26,777
The difference between
you and chocolate--

00:19:26,777 --> 00:19:28,127
Want me to tell you?
Please.

00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,027
Chocolate doesn't disappoint.

00:19:32,947 --> 00:19:34,027
Yeah!

00:19:34,027 --> 00:19:36,877
I love you,
and I love your Fudge.

00:19:36,877 --> 00:19:38,877
I think I found
your other partner.

00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:40,127
She's just as crazy as you.

00:19:40,127 --> 00:19:43,047
I'm introducing you

00:19:43,047 --> 00:19:44,827
(Barbara) Donna,
do you mind if I give you

00:19:44,827 --> 00:19:46,167
some honest feedback?
Yes.

00:19:46,167 --> 00:19:47,967
Okay.

00:19:47,967 --> 00:19:49,727
You know what I see
in front of me?

00:19:49,727 --> 00:19:53,067
A wildly enthusiastic lady
who likes to make Fudge.

00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:56,077
I don't think this has a thing
to do with money.

00:19:56,077 --> 00:19:59,797
I think all you want to do is
get out there and meet people,

00:19:59,797 --> 00:20:01,917
get attention, share your
enthusiasm for your product,

00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:03,967
and that's
what you're doing already.

00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:06,167
There's no room in this deal
for any kind of a partner.

00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:08,947
Why don't you just keep doing
what you're doing?

00:20:08,947 --> 00:20:11,177
I'm out.

00:20:18,997 --> 00:20:20,817
definitely. A good show.
I enjoy your energy.

you need me.

00:22:04,847 --> 00:22:08,467
thrown out
with the rest of the trash.

00:22:08,467 --> 00:22:09,717
And that's when it hit me--

00:22:09,717 --> 00:22:11,827
why can't I deliver
a live tree

00:22:11,827 --> 00:22:14,547
in a container like this
before Christmas

00:22:14,547 --> 00:22:16,647
and pick it up afterwards?

00:22:16,647 --> 00:22:19,547
In 2008,
I took my napkin sketch

00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:20,817
and turned it into a web site.

00:22:20,817 --> 00:22:22,697
We rented a hundred trees

00:22:22,697 --> 00:22:25,397
and delivered them out of
the back of my pickup truck.

00:22:25,397 --> 00:22:28,617
Last year we delivered
over 1,300 trees.

00:22:28,617 --> 00:22:31,567
The time has come
to invite a partner.

00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:34,477
You see, just because
it's a good idea,

00:22:34,477 --> 00:22:36,477
it doesn't make
my trees grow faster.

00:22:36,477 --> 00:22:38,477
But money does.

00:22:38,477 --> 00:22:40,467
And with an investor

00:22:40,467 --> 00:22:41,717
and the right partner,

00:22:41,717 --> 00:22:43,677
we can take this national

00:22:43,677 --> 00:22:46,577
and change the way the country
celebrates Christmas.

00:22:46,577 --> 00:22:47,777
Thank you.

00:22:47,777 --> 00:22:50,467
Scotty Claus, how much
do you rent the trees for?

00:22:50,467 --> 00:22:51,667
The average tree
is about $100.

00:22:51,667 --> 00:22:53,517
It goes up to $200.

00:22:53,517 --> 00:22:55,867
So it might be more expensive
to rent a $200 tree from you

00:22:55,867 --> 00:22:57,717
than it would be
to buy it locally?
Right.

00:22:57,717 --> 00:22:59,677
Oh.
We're definitely not trying
to go after that market.

00:22:59,677 --> 00:23:01,427
(Daymond)
Why would I pay for that

00:23:01,427 --> 00:23:02,877
if I could buy it
at the same price?

00:23:02,877 --> 00:23:04,667
We deliver it to your house
and we pick it up afterwards.

00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:05,827
You don't want a tree.

00:23:05,827 --> 00:23:07,597
You're looking for
the service of a tree.

00:23:07,597 --> 00:23:08,767
Half of the fun of the tree

00:23:08,767 --> 00:23:10,797
is going to pick it out
with the family,

00:23:10,797 --> 00:23:12,527
you know--
(Barbara) Only for
the first five years.

00:23:12,527 --> 00:23:14,477
After that, it's a pain
in the neck.
Yeah.

00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:15,567
(Robert) True, Barbara.

00:23:15,567 --> 00:23:16,647
What is the process
of picking it out?

00:23:16,647 --> 00:23:17,727
Right now,
you can go on-Line.

00:23:17,727 --> 00:23:18,877
We have five different trees
to choose from.

00:23:18,877 --> 00:23:20,547
We have elves--
Every one has Christmas names--

00:23:20,547 --> 00:23:22,727
We have Justin season,
gregnog.

00:23:22,727 --> 00:23:23,847
These guys deliver
that tree to your house.

00:23:23,847 --> 00:23:25,617
(laughs)
Then pick it up afterwards.

00:23:25,617 --> 00:23:26,847
How many markets
are you in?

00:23:26,847 --> 00:23:28,427
Right now,
it's Southern california.

00:23:28,427 --> 00:23:29,767
(Robert) I like the idea.

00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:31,667
Like Barbara said,
first five years, going in the--

00:23:31,667 --> 00:23:33,777
in the forest, cutting down
my own Tree was wonderful.

00:23:33,777 --> 00:23:35,867
After that, I want somebody
to deliver it.

00:23:35,867 --> 00:23:37,667
Going into the forest
and cutting it down?

00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:39,547
I didn't say go in the forest
and cutting it down.

00:23:39,547 --> 00:23:40,677
(mark and Barbara laugh)

00:23:40,677 --> 00:23:42,627
Is that croatian?
No! That's the kind of...

00:23:42,627 --> 00:23:44,547
(Scott) Let me tell you,
there's people--
Hardy guy I am.

00:23:44,547 --> 00:23:46,647
I go into the forest,
I cut my own tree, mark.

00:23:46,647 --> 00:23:50,577
So the cache is,
it's the same tree every year,

00:23:50,577 --> 00:23:52,527
it becomes part of our family?

00:23:52,527 --> 00:23:53,617
Yeah.

00:23:53,617 --> 00:23:54,747
The whole symbol
about having a tree

00:23:54,747 --> 00:23:55,827
is something that's alive
in your home,

00:23:55,827 --> 00:23:57,417
and the difference of having

00:23:57,417 --> 00:23:58,747
something slowly dying
in the corner

00:23:58,747 --> 00:24:00,597
or plastic in the corner
as opposed to live tree

00:24:00,597 --> 00:24:01,847
is a completely different
experience.

00:24:01,847 --> 00:24:03,467
What are the sales?

00:24:03,467 --> 00:24:04,767
$150,000.

00:24:04,767 --> 00:24:08,477
$150,000 in your season,
which is basically one month.

00:24:08,477 --> 00:24:09,567
Yeah, it's a 2-Month season.

00:24:09,567 --> 00:24:11,447
And what's your profit
on that?

00:24:11,447 --> 00:24:12,527
$33,000.

00:24:12,527 --> 00:24:13,747
And that's after
paying yourself?

00:24:13,747 --> 00:24:15,467
No, I have not paid myself.

00:24:15,467 --> 00:24:17,447
Do I have to pay
if I kill the tree?

00:24:17,447 --> 00:24:19,427
On the web site, it says
that there is a penalty.

00:24:19,427 --> 00:24:21,417
You go on the naughty list
and--And you get fined.

00:24:21,417 --> 00:24:22,777
The fact of the matter is,
if someone's gone

00:24:22,777 --> 00:24:24,447
out of their way to rent
a living Christmas tree,

00:24:24,447 --> 00:24:25,647
they tend to take care of it.

00:24:25,647 --> 00:24:26,727
What do you need?

00:24:26,727 --> 00:24:28,697
So I need capital
and infrastructure.

00:24:28,697 --> 00:24:30,777
I need a nursery with
an automatic irrigation system.

00:24:30,777 --> 00:24:33,547
I need to be able to plant
my own trees from seedlings

00:24:33,547 --> 00:24:34,627
and grow them
all the way through.

00:24:34,627 --> 00:24:35,797
Then I control my inventory.

00:24:35,797 --> 00:24:37,597
Let me tell you all the ways
I hate this business.

00:24:37,597 --> 00:24:38,827
Number one, I hate it

00:24:38,827 --> 00:24:40,797
because it's Only
for six weeks of the year.

00:24:40,797 --> 00:24:42,767
Sure.
Number two, I hate it

00:24:42,767 --> 00:24:44,767
because it's more expensive
than just buying it.

00:24:44,767 --> 00:24:46,747
So my market is only people

00:24:46,747 --> 00:24:48,647
that cumbaya and don't want
to kill at tree.
Sure.

00:24:48,647 --> 00:24:50,397
And then number three,
I hate it

00:24:50,397 --> 00:24:52,467
because the competition
is a plastic tree

00:24:52,467 --> 00:24:53,717
that I can get
that looks identical.

00:24:53,717 --> 00:24:55,727
If I hid a plastic tree
in here right now,

00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:57,577
you couldn't tell
the difference.

00:24:59,417 --> 00:25:00,717
I really hate it. I'm out.

00:25:03,467 --> 00:25:07,527
This is very, very attractive
and endearing to me.

00:25:07,527 --> 00:25:09,727
It's a green play.
I love that.

00:25:09,727 --> 00:25:11,547
I have a-a tree farm.

00:25:11,547 --> 00:25:14,727
I've been dying to be
in business with a guy

00:25:14,727 --> 00:25:16,547
with a handlebar moustache.

00:25:16,547 --> 00:25:17,617
(sharks laugh)

00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:18,747
All right?
There's only one thing

00:25:18,747 --> 00:25:19,877
higher on my priority list
than being in business

00:25:19,877 --> 00:25:22,397
with a guy
with a handlebar moustache.

00:25:22,397 --> 00:25:23,647
You know what that is?
What's that?

00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,797
Being in business with a woman
with a handlebar moustache.

00:25:25,797 --> 00:25:27,867
(all laugh)

00:25:27,867 --> 00:25:29,527
I'll keep a lookout
for you.

00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:30,597
I know the challenges
you're gonna face.

00:25:30,597 --> 00:25:31,767
You have the price of gas
going up,

00:25:31,767 --> 00:25:33,717
so now you're gonna go
and ship these trees,

00:25:33,717 --> 00:25:35,627
then you're gonna pick 'em up
and bring 'em back, right?

00:25:35,627 --> 00:25:38,447
The trees grow,
you need to acquire more land.

00:25:38,447 --> 00:25:40,527
That means, more fertilizer,
that means more water,

00:25:40,527 --> 00:25:42,767
that means more having to deal
with deer and other things

00:25:42,767 --> 00:25:44,667
that are killing the trees.

00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:46,797
And the--the answers
you're giving me,

00:25:46,797 --> 00:25:48,467
you're gonna figure out

00:25:48,467 --> 00:25:49,877
are a little Harder
than you think they're gonna be.

00:25:49,877 --> 00:25:51,877
So I'm out.

00:25:51,877 --> 00:25:53,767
Very sweet of you.

00:25:55,847 --> 00:25:58,797
(Robert) Scotty Claus,
I don't want to be a grinch.

00:25:58,797 --> 00:26:00,467
I'm not seeing the growth curve.
Okay.

00:26:00,467 --> 00:26:02,717
I-I think
it's a good business for you,

00:26:02,717 --> 00:26:04,797
not an investment for me.

00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:06,577
I'm out.

00:26:06,577 --> 00:26:08,767
Okay. Fair enough.

00:26:12,827 --> 00:26:16,617
So and--And--And--
And--And so what I'm offering,

00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:17,697
it's a $2-Billion market.

00:26:17,697 --> 00:26:18,817
One thing we know--

00:26:18,817 --> 00:26:20,567
that Christmas is not gonna be
canceled next year.

00:26:20,567 --> 00:26:21,697
It's gonna happen.

00:26:21,697 --> 00:26:23,627
I feel like I've--I've solved

00:26:23,627 --> 00:26:25,877
the deforestation problem,
the convenience problem,

00:26:25,877 --> 00:26:27,667
by what we're doing.

00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:28,827
(Barbara)
But here's the rub, right?

00:26:28,827 --> 00:26:30,827
You've been
in business four years,

00:26:30,827 --> 00:26:33,777
and you had a $33,000 profit.

00:26:33,777 --> 00:26:35,567
Think about that.

00:26:35,567 --> 00:26:37,767
I don't doubt your passion.
Sure.

00:26:37,767 --> 00:26:39,517
I'm out
'cause I just don't believe

00:26:39,517 --> 00:26:41,397
there's enough profit
in this business.

00:26:41,397 --> 00:26:42,877
Fair enough. Thank you.

00:26:44,577 --> 00:26:47,497
Okay. What is not
being told here

00:26:47,497 --> 00:26:48,777
is what I'm able to do

00:26:48,777 --> 00:26:50,777
with the investment I've made
over the last four years,

00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:52,847
the dozens of people
I've employed,

00:26:52,847 --> 00:26:54,597
and the value
I've been able to create

00:26:54,597 --> 00:26:56,597
because I took something
that used to be thrown away

00:26:56,597 --> 00:26:58,647
and gave value to it.

00:26:58,647 --> 00:26:59,817
I hire vets.

00:26:59,817 --> 00:27:01,617
I mean, perfect guys
for delivering Christmas trees.

00:27:01,617 --> 00:27:03,867
Guys who know logistics,
know how to get the work done.

00:27:03,867 --> 00:27:06,677
But having a business that is
able to give back and make money

00:27:06,677 --> 00:27:09,727
and make a profit
is meaningful.

00:27:09,727 --> 00:27:12,417
And so I give people meaningful
jobs during the holidays

00:27:12,417 --> 00:27:13,827
they wouldn't have had
otherwise.

00:27:13,827 --> 00:27:15,727
I set this up
as a for-Profit company

00:27:15,727 --> 00:27:17,477
to do well By doing good.

00:27:18,597 --> 00:27:20,747
(Mark) Scotty Claus

00:27:20,747 --> 00:27:23,777
I-I'm a believer in convenience
with a conscience.

00:27:23,777 --> 00:27:25,567
I think you have
some Real challenges

00:27:25,567 --> 00:27:26,867
from a capital perspective.

00:27:26,867 --> 00:27:28,567
Right.

00:27:28,567 --> 00:27:29,877
I think you have
some pricing challenges.

00:27:29,877 --> 00:27:33,417
I think you're gonna
have to turn off

00:27:33,417 --> 00:27:35,577
the "Let's just be
the nice guy Scotty Claus"--

00:27:35,577 --> 00:27:37,827
to that point,
I'm on the "shark tank."

00:27:37,827 --> 00:27:39,497
This isn't, you know,
the guppy pond.

00:27:39,497 --> 00:27:40,827
I came here
with the idea that

00:27:40,827 --> 00:27:42,667
I've gotta be willing
to make some changes.

00:27:42,667 --> 00:27:44,627
So if I gave you
the $150,000,

00:27:44,627 --> 00:27:46,697
how many more jobs
do you think you can create?

00:27:46,697 --> 00:27:48,447
How many more veterans
do you think you could hire?

00:27:48,447 --> 00:27:49,667
Oh, man, I could--
I mean, as I keep growing,

00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,517
I'm--I'm doubling the jobs
because it--it--

00:27:51,517 --> 00:27:53,817
I need a set number of people to
deliver the set number of trees.

00:27:53,817 --> 00:27:55,727
I mean, that's--That's--
It's 200 jobs.

00:27:55,727 --> 00:27:57,527
Okay.

00:27:58,667 --> 00:28:00,627
What are you gonna do,
Mark?

00:28:00,627 --> 00:28:02,497
Is Christmas gonna come early?

00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:10,427
Here's what
I'm willing to do.

00:28:15,497 --> 00:28:18,597
I'll give you the $150,000...

00:28:24,527 --> 00:28:27,527
and I'll take 40%...

00:28:27,527 --> 00:28:29,527
and I'll provide you support.

00:28:29,527 --> 00:28:30,697
Okay.

00:28:30,697 --> 00:28:32,427
You're
the landscape architect.

00:28:32,427 --> 00:28:34,677
So all that side of it
is all you.

00:28:34,677 --> 00:28:36,477
What I know inside and out.

00:28:36,477 --> 00:28:37,847
We're gonna have to
work together to figure out

00:28:37,847 --> 00:28:39,647
how to scale this thing.

00:28:39,647 --> 00:28:41,677
What do you say,
Scotty Claus?

00:28:45,427 --> 00:28:46,667
(laughs) that to me
sounds like a deal, mark.

00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:48,417
Let's do it.
All right.

00:28:48,417 --> 00:28:49,727
(Robert) Wow.

00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:50,817
(chuckles)

00:28:50,817 --> 00:28:52,717
(laughs
and speaks indistinctly)

00:28:52,717 --> 00:28:54,717
(laughs)

00:28:54,717 --> 00:28:56,467
Santa Claus really exists.

00:28:56,467 --> 00:28:57,717
(Mark)
No. I'm not Santa Claus.

00:28:57,717 --> 00:28:59,767
Trust me. If I can't make money
at it, it's not happening.

00:28:59,767 --> 00:29:01,467
We'll create a web site,

00:29:01,467 --> 00:29:02,697
we'll put the pictures
of the guys that we hired

00:29:02,697 --> 00:29:03,867
and let them show
who delivered the tree.

00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,747
Right.
We'll create
a history of every tree,

00:29:05,747 --> 00:29:07,597
the families
that have owned it

00:29:07,597 --> 00:29:09,467
so there's more connection.

00:29:09,467 --> 00:29:10,717
There's so many positives
about this

00:29:10,717 --> 00:29:12,627
that if the only thing
keeping you from doing this

00:29:12,627 --> 00:29:15,467
a thousand times more
is a little bit of money,

00:29:15,467 --> 00:29:16,547
money's easy.
Yeah.

00:29:16,547 --> 00:29:17,717
Doing the right thing
isn't always.

00:29:17,717 --> 00:29:19,467
(speaks indistinctly)
Appreciate it, Scotty.

00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:21,667
Awesome.
Thank you.

00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:23,527
Thank you, all.

00:29:23,527 --> 00:29:25,417
Boy, did not see that coming.
(Daymond)
I didn't see it either.

00:29:25,417 --> 00:29:27,777
I can't explain how excited
I am right now.

00:29:27,777 --> 00:29:30,397
It's been something
I have worked so hard,

00:29:30,397 --> 00:29:33,767
went through so many long days,
long nights

working at this,
believing in this,

00:29:35,517 --> 00:29:37,547
and the fact that mark cuban
believes in it, too,

00:29:37,547 --> 00:29:39,827
is so invigorating
and so empowering

00:29:39,827 --> 00:29:42,417

Hi, I'm Jillian Jaccard,

00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:11,817
and we're the owners
of the partie Poche group.

00:30:11,817 --> 00:30:14,157
We are seeking
a $100,000 investment

00:30:14,157 --> 00:30:16,907
for a 20% equity stake
in our company.

00:30:16,907 --> 00:30:18,967
We're both students
a loyola marymount University,

00:30:18,967 --> 00:30:20,217
where I'm pursuing

in accounting and finance,

00:30:21,807 --> 00:30:23,007
and Connor is getting
his M.B.A.

00:30:23,007 --> 00:30:25,207
When I used to live with
a bunch of sorority girls,

00:30:25,207 --> 00:30:28,087
I witnessed firsthand

00:30:28,087 --> 00:30:30,007
a female phenomena
of our generation.

00:30:30,007 --> 00:30:32,067
When going out
for a night on the town,

00:30:32,067 --> 00:30:33,937
it's commonplace for girls
to stuff their phone,

00:30:33,937 --> 00:30:35,787
cards, I.D.

00:30:35,787 --> 00:30:37,217
Into their bras...

00:30:37,217 --> 00:30:38,807
Really?

00:30:38,807 --> 00:30:39,957
To avoid the hassle
of carrying a purse.

00:30:39,957 --> 00:30:41,037
Yes, really.

00:30:41,037 --> 00:30:42,787
Stop the madness.

00:30:42,787 --> 00:30:44,017
Our product is partie Poche,

00:30:44,017 --> 00:30:46,207
a novel nightlife
fashion accessory

00:30:46,207 --> 00:30:49,137
that conveniently replaces
a handbag or clutch

00:30:49,137 --> 00:30:51,267
by carrying a woman's essentials
around her leg.

00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:54,187
No one wants to lug around
a bulky handbag

00:30:54,187 --> 00:30:56,187
when the whole purpose
of going out is to dance,

00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,037
be carefree, and have fun.

00:30:58,037 --> 00:31:00,037
And not only
does it look adorable,

00:31:00,037 --> 00:31:02,267
but it's so comfortable that
I forget I'm wearing it.

00:31:02,267 --> 00:31:04,957
As part of this target market,

00:31:04,957 --> 00:31:07,787
I can assure that Partie Poche
will sell.

00:31:07,787 --> 00:31:09,917
So remember, when you party,

00:31:09,917 --> 00:31:12,137
partie Poche.

00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:15,257
Jillian, you say "Will sell."
Have you sold anything?

00:31:15,257 --> 00:31:18,257
Yes, we sold 200
on our web site.

00:31:18,257 --> 00:31:20,117
And then all of a sudden,
we were shipping these things

00:31:20,117 --> 00:31:21,937
to maine, to Vermont,
to Virginia...

00:31:21,937 --> 00:31:23,807
But if people didn't
know your name...
all over.

00:31:23,807 --> 00:31:25,067
How did they find
your website?

00:31:25,067 --> 00:31:26,237
Because people are actively

00:31:26,237 --> 00:31:29,107
looking for a way
to solve this problem.

00:31:29,107 --> 00:31:31,087
How much does each unit
sell for?

00:31:31,087 --> 00:31:33,117
The majority of those units
sold for $17.

00:31:33,117 --> 00:31:36,237
But we started bumping up
between $17

00:31:36,237 --> 00:31:38,237
all the way to $39
toward the end of the 200,

00:31:38,237 --> 00:31:40,967
and we ended up selling
about 27 of them

00:31:40,967 --> 00:31:42,987
at the $39 price point.

00:31:42,987 --> 00:31:45,057
And is there anything
proprietary about this?

00:31:45,057 --> 00:31:46,137
Do you have a patent?

00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:47,787
We do have
a provisional patent.

00:31:47,787 --> 00:31:49,867
You're telling me,
for $100,000 I get 20%.

00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:51,817
(Connor) correct.
And because
you're smart M.B.A.S

00:31:51,817 --> 00:31:53,067
and accounting people,

00:31:53,067 --> 00:31:55,057
what are you saying your
business is worth right now?

00:31:55,057 --> 00:31:56,857
So we're gonna
steer you clear--

00:31:56,857 --> 00:31:57,907
What is it?
Give me the number.

00:31:57,907 --> 00:31:59,237
Let me--Let me--
Let me preface that--

00:31:59,237 --> 00:32:01,087
professor O'Leary
wants to know the answer.

00:32:01,087 --> 00:32:02,937
Let me--Let me try and steer you
clear of a valuation--

00:32:02,937 --> 00:32:04,267
Are you groveling and begging
'cause you know the answer

00:32:04,267 --> 00:32:06,157
is crazy?
We want--He wants to know--

00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:08,057
okay. Connor, can I take it?
What's crazy is to try

00:32:08,057 --> 00:32:10,157
to value a company
that is pre-Revenue.

00:32:10,157 --> 00:32:12,187
(Connor) it makes no sense. We
could do discounted Cash flow--
Well done.

00:32:12,187 --> 00:32:13,787
Point well done.
Let me value it.

00:32:13,787 --> 00:32:14,907
You know what?
But the problem is that--Is--

00:32:14,907 --> 00:32:16,157
(Jillian) But I can talk
discounted cash flows

00:32:16,157 --> 00:32:18,237
and intangible assets
right now.
One second. One second.

00:32:18,237 --> 00:32:19,907
(Kevin) 'cause you know--
Jillian, you know...
bring it on. Let's do it.

00:32:19,907 --> 00:32:21,207
You're gonna sell exactly
how many in 12 months?

00:32:21,207 --> 00:32:23,237
You don't know.
Yes. Well,
I don't know exactly.

00:32:23,237 --> 00:32:24,887
(laughs)

00:32:24,887 --> 00:32:26,807
How much are you saying
your company is worth?

00:32:26,807 --> 00:32:29,107
Okay, 200--If we sell 200,000
units in the first year--

00:32:29,107 --> 00:32:30,867
No, wait.
No, no, no. You asked for--

00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:33,087
the question is, when you
impute a value on the company--

00:32:33,087 --> 00:32:36,167
I give you $100,000,
you give me 20% of the stock--

00:32:36,167 --> 00:32:38,917
What are you telling me
your company's worth today?

00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:41,967
I based 2 valuation methods
off of 200,000 units of sales

00:32:41,967 --> 00:32:44,167
or 100,000 units of sales
in the first year.

00:32:44,167 --> 00:32:47,157
That brought us to
a $4.3-Million valuation

00:32:47,157 --> 00:32:50,067
and then
a $1.9-Million valuation.

00:32:50,067 --> 00:32:51,817
You still haven't given us
the answer.

00:32:51,817 --> 00:32:54,887
There is a number that you have
valuated your company at--

00:32:54,887 --> 00:32:56,007
$500,000 is what--

00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:57,087
there you go.
That's all.

00:32:57,087 --> 00:32:58,237
But--but that's not what
I'm valuing it at

00:32:58,237 --> 00:33:00,087
because I realized
that's it not just the cash.

00:33:00,087 --> 00:33:01,237
But if you can make
a value 500--
the cash is just an asset--

00:33:01,237 --> 00:33:02,967
Okay, you know what?
You wasted Everybody's time.

00:33:02,967 --> 00:33:04,057
'cause they had--they don't--
They're not creative

00:33:04,057 --> 00:33:05,937
to think about anything else

00:33:05,937 --> 00:33:07,237
and they have no ability
to increase the value.

00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:09,187
Why isn't it--
So this is the deal--

00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:10,857
Well, I bet you she'll be
real accurate about my money

00:33:10,857 --> 00:33:12,087
when it comes over there,
right?
Tell us--

00:33:12,087 --> 00:33:14,037
She'll have an accurate
valuation of that, wouldn't she?

00:33:14,037 --> 00:33:15,967
Tell us about how much
it costs to make these

00:33:15,967 --> 00:33:17,957
and how low you think
you can get your cost,

00:33:17,957 --> 00:33:20,007
um, based off of,
um, volume.

00:33:20,007 --> 00:33:23,117
(Connor) So recently we
partnered with a manufacturer

00:33:23,117 --> 00:33:26,987
and, uh, she quoted us
at $4, said and done.

00:33:26,987 --> 00:33:29,137
We have the infrastructure
to support the 200,000 units

00:33:29,137 --> 00:33:31,207
that I said we can sell.

00:33:31,207 --> 00:33:32,867
And I can break--
If we cut it in--

00:33:32,867 --> 00:33:34,117
Down into 100,000 units
for one year,

00:33:34,117 --> 00:33:36,157
that's $1.9-Million
valuation.

00:33:36,157 --> 00:33:37,907
I can--I can break out--

00:33:37,907 --> 00:33:39,037
I'm in this space.

00:33:39,037 --> 00:33:40,807
It sounds really good,
what you're saying.

00:33:40,807 --> 00:33:41,857
Thank you.

00:33:41,857 --> 00:33:43,107
It's worth nothing.

00:33:43,107 --> 00:33:45,007
Well, we ha--
Not yet. It can't
be worth anything,

00:33:45,007 --> 00:33:47,237
which is why we don't try
to valuate in front of it.
But you're asking--

00:33:47,237 --> 00:33:49,007
You just said "Not yet.
It can't be worth anything,"

00:33:49,007 --> 00:33:50,117
but you want

00:33:50,117 --> 00:33:52,807
a half-a-million-Dollars
valuation on our company.

00:33:52,807 --> 00:33:54,817
I had a meeting with the vice
president of sales and marketing

00:33:54,817 --> 00:33:56,107
at Nordstrom
up in seattle about--

00:33:56,107 --> 00:33:57,937
and what did they say?

00:33:57,937 --> 00:33:59,207
Loved the concept.

00:33:59,207 --> 00:34:01,207
But you need a buyer? Did they
put you in touch with a buyer?

00:34:01,207 --> 00:34:03,037
No. He said, "I don't want to
put you in touch with a buyer

00:34:03,037 --> 00:34:05,037
until you have
the final product."
(Daymond) right.

00:34:05,037 --> 00:34:06,117
But you have put

00:34:06,117 --> 00:34:08,837
a half-a-million-Dollar
valuation on

00:34:08,837 --> 00:34:10,857
basically a piece of hosiery
with a bag.

00:34:10,857 --> 00:34:12,107
Daymond, are you--
maybe it's
the best thing ever...

00:34:12,107 --> 00:34:13,957
are you saying that
everything comes back

00:34:13,957 --> 00:34:16,007
to one thing in life--
Money?
Yes.

00:34:16,007 --> 00:34:17,787
Okay, then let me take it
from here.

00:34:17,787 --> 00:34:18,967
You're insane.
(Connor laughs)

00:34:18,967 --> 00:34:21,037
This is not worth $500,000.

00:34:21,037 --> 00:34:24,807
Under no scenario would I ever
give you $100,000 for only 20%.

00:34:24,807 --> 00:34:27,867
$100,000 is what
the whole thing is worth, maybe.

00:34:27,867 --> 00:34:29,207
I'm stuck.
I'm choking on it, you know?

00:34:29,207 --> 00:34:30,807
Let me address that.

00:34:30,807 --> 00:34:32,057
There's nothing
you can say.
If we--

00:34:32,057 --> 00:34:34,167
there's not a word--
Another word you could say

00:34:34,167 --> 00:34:36,007
that would ever, ever, ever
convince me this--

00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:37,167
What about "money"?

00:34:37,167 --> 00:34:39,807
we have 50 grand cash
in our account.
(laughs)

00:34:39,807 --> 00:34:41,157
Where did you get
the 50 grand?

00:34:41,157 --> 00:34:42,807
We had
two people approach us.

00:34:42,807 --> 00:34:44,857
Their buy-In, their capital
contribution was 50 grand.

00:34:44,857 --> 00:34:46,887
At that time, we didn't
even have a product.

00:34:46,887 --> 00:34:48,907
It was an idea.
You still don't.

00:34:48,907 --> 00:34:50,157
We do. That--
That will sell.

00:34:50,157 --> 00:34:52,207
This one on my leg
will sell on a web site.

00:34:52,207 --> 00:34:53,957
So what did you--
Will sell.

00:34:53,957 --> 00:34:55,807
How much of the company
did you sell them for $50,000?

00:34:55,807 --> 00:34:56,887
40%.

00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:58,887
Jillian and I
are 60% stakeholders.

00:34:58,887 --> 00:35:00,887
They got 40% for $50,000?

00:35:00,887 --> 00:35:01,907
We had nothing
at that point.

00:35:01,907 --> 00:35:03,167
Oh, my goodness.

00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:05,057
We didn't have a distributor.
We didn't have a designer.

00:35:05,057 --> 00:35:06,857
(laughs)
We didn't have p.O.S
hanging in front of us.

00:35:06,857 --> 00:35:08,187
Do you see my dilemma?
You still
don't have a p.O.

00:35:08,187 --> 00:35:09,837
Wait, wait. But, Kevin...
we have p.O.S
hanging in front of us.

00:35:09,837 --> 00:35:11,117
They're--
they are also working.

00:35:11,117 --> 00:35:12,787
They're managing partners--
You come in here
with this story...

00:35:12,787 --> 00:35:13,867
they work 60 hours a week.

00:35:13,867 --> 00:35:15,117
And you charge me
ten times more?

00:35:15,117 --> 00:35:16,917
Are you crazy?

00:35:16,917 --> 00:35:18,167
No, I'm not crazy...
Well, it's not ten times.

00:35:18,167 --> 00:35:19,907
Because that's what
the company's worth.

00:35:19,907 --> 00:35:21,157
Guys, you guys
just don't get it.

00:35:21,157 --> 00:35:24,817
You don't have a--you have P.O.S
that you can show us?

00:35:24,817 --> 00:35:25,907
No, we don't have P.O.S

00:35:25,907 --> 00:35:26,987
no, I'm saying.
I have a--one waiting.

00:35:26,987 --> 00:35:28,067
I mean, 24,000 units--

00:35:28,067 --> 00:35:29,857
You have one waiting.
Oh, I got it.

00:35:29,857 --> 00:35:31,067
I just didn't have
a product to give to her.

00:35:31,067 --> 00:35:32,207
(sharks laughing)
(Connor) Look, Kevin,

00:35:32,207 --> 00:35:34,037
if you were willing to work
and slave on this product--

00:35:34,037 --> 00:35:35,917
(Kevin) Connor...
you can have the exact
same rate they got.

00:35:35,917 --> 00:35:37,907
Critical mistake
if you think I would ever pay

00:35:37,907 --> 00:35:41,957
10 times more than some college
guy got it for 30 days ago.

00:35:41,957 --> 00:35:43,107
Are you out of your minds?

00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:44,787
Okay, it's five times.
Five times more.

00:35:44,787 --> 00:35:46,817
Only five times?
Oh, that's much more exciting.

00:35:46,817 --> 00:35:48,037
Well, no, let's talk about what
they brought to the company

00:35:48,037 --> 00:35:49,937
because that's worth a lot.
Sure. Cash, right?

00:35:49,937 --> 00:35:51,017
They brought cash...
Cash--

00:35:51,017 --> 00:35:52,217
But they also--
they brought a designer,

00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:55,067
a supplier in are area that
can produce any quantity,

00:35:55,067 --> 00:35:56,787
literally any quantity,

00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:57,937
up to a million units
within a year.

00:35:57,937 --> 00:35:59,257
By the way--
That's invaluable,

00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:00,957
to find a supply chain
that is well-Oiled.
All right, look, look--

00:36:00,957 --> 00:36:02,057
That is not invaluable.
That's everybody.
I-I--

00:36:02,057 --> 00:36:03,907
to find a supply chain
that is well-Oiled?

00:36:03,907 --> 00:36:05,167
That's everybody.
That's out there.
I am very, very worried--

00:36:05,167 --> 00:36:06,917
That's everybody.

00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:08,137
That's something we didn't have
before we had them.

00:36:08,137 --> 00:36:09,787
What do you think
factories exist for?
(Barbara) Talk.

00:36:09,787 --> 00:36:10,957
(Kevin) listen, I'm very worried
for both of you

00:36:10,957 --> 00:36:12,117
because what happens
if you come in here

00:36:12,117 --> 00:36:13,787
with a crazy valuation--

00:36:13,787 --> 00:36:15,137
Sometimes a lightning Bolt

00:36:15,137 --> 00:36:16,807
comes from the ceiling
and Fries you.

00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:18,137
And I think that's happening
right now.

00:36:18,137 --> 00:36:20,037
I am out.

00:36:21,257 --> 00:36:23,257
Gone. Out.

00:36:23,257 --> 00:36:26,867
And I forbid any of these sharks
to get involved with you.

00:36:26,867 --> 00:36:28,787
Wow. Well, let me, uh,
double back

00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:30,837
and start talking about
the demand again,

00:36:30,837 --> 00:36:32,167
because I-I know
it will sell.

00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:34,057
I'm standing here,

00:36:34,057 --> 00:36:36,207
and that $500,000 valuation,
Kevin, it kills me.

00:36:36,207 --> 00:36:39,237
Next week I can sign
a $124,000 purchase order.

00:36:39,237 --> 00:36:40,817
Next week.

00:36:40,817 --> 00:36:41,987
Is that--Is that right?
You think that, right?

00:36:41,987 --> 00:36:43,867
And I'm gonna give away
20% of my company

00:36:43,867 --> 00:36:46,987
for a $100,000 to you?

00:36:46,987 --> 00:36:51,017
You have such a thick skull
that you're not listening to us.

00:36:51,017 --> 00:36:52,217
Mm-hmm.

00:36:52,217 --> 00:36:53,967
You're not getting
what we're saying to you.

00:36:53,967 --> 00:36:55,887
I have about
ten apparel companies,

00:36:55,887 --> 00:36:59,087
and I can't get
a $125,000 opening order

00:36:59,087 --> 00:37:00,887
on a new product line.

00:37:00,887 --> 00:37:02,857
It just doesn't happen.

00:37:02,857 --> 00:37:06,107
What if your board member
works directly with...

00:37:06,107 --> 00:37:07,267
Who cares where
your board member works?

00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:09,087
That doesn't--
who cares?

00:37:09,087 --> 00:37:10,257
The way stores Work is...
who cares who your--

00:37:10,257 --> 00:37:12,837
they give you a small order,
they test you.

00:37:12,837 --> 00:37:14,837
Then they come back.
Then they come back.

00:37:14,837 --> 00:37:17,167
Everything you've said here
is incorrect.

00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:18,967
It's just theory.

00:37:18,967 --> 00:37:20,217
(Robert) You know,
the success in business

00:37:20,217 --> 00:37:22,967
is by going out
and actually selling stuff.

00:37:22,967 --> 00:37:25,907
I find it so arrogant
of you to--

00:37:25,907 --> 00:37:28,917
to be so flippant about
your ability to get orders

00:37:28,917 --> 00:37:30,237
when you don't have
any orders.

00:37:30,237 --> 00:37:33,807
You've done everything
except get dirty.

00:37:33,807 --> 00:37:35,217
(Connor) I completely
appreciate that.

00:37:35,217 --> 00:37:38,107
And believe me when I tell you
that I am willing

00:37:38,107 --> 00:37:40,107
to get out there,
to put in the 80-Hour weeks,

00:37:40,107 --> 00:37:42,117
and to slave
to make this thing happen.

00:37:42,117 --> 00:37:45,057
And that's going back to what
that $500,000 valuation is,

00:37:45,057 --> 00:37:47,057
is you're buying us.

00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:48,917
You're buying our time,
our emotion, and our passion

00:37:48,917 --> 00:37:50,157
to make this thing happen.

00:37:50,157 --> 00:37:51,957
It doesn't matter
who you know.

00:37:51,957 --> 00:37:53,887
It doesn't matter
what connections you have.

00:37:53,887 --> 00:37:57,157
None of that crap matters when
you get out in the real world.

00:37:57,157 --> 00:37:59,037
Go out, get dirty,

00:37:59,037 --> 00:38:00,257
get some sales.

00:38:00,257 --> 00:38:01,937
I'm out.

00:38:03,237 --> 00:38:06,107
You came in here
with no orders, 200 sold,

00:38:06,107 --> 00:38:08,017
and you said, "It's worth
a half a million dollars."

00:38:08,017 --> 00:38:10,957
I know. We gave you guys a deal.
I'm 100% aware of that.

00:38:10,957 --> 00:38:12,157
(Robert and Daymond laugh)

00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:13,237
(Kevin) I believe him.

00:38:13,237 --> 00:38:14,907
All right. Go ahead.
He gave us a deal.

00:38:14,907 --> 00:38:17,887
I'm--I'm thinking Bambi
about to meet godzilla.

00:38:17,887 --> 00:38:19,207
I mean,
that's what's gonna happen.

00:38:19,207 --> 00:38:20,957
You're gonna walk out
of the shark tank

00:38:20,957 --> 00:38:22,207
into the real world,

00:38:22,207 --> 00:38:24,007
and it is going to
eat you alive.

00:38:24,007 --> 00:38:25,217
You don't know me, Kevin.
You're gonna be kicking--

00:38:25,217 --> 00:38:26,967
You're gonna be
kicking yourselves...
alive.

00:38:26,967 --> 00:38:29,037
That you didn't get in
with us.
Oh, my goodness.

00:38:29,037 --> 00:38:30,207
Kevin, you don't know me.
(Kevin groans)

00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:31,967
You don't know
how I can fight, Kevin.

00:38:31,967 --> 00:38:33,787
(Barbara) I don't think
This is gonna sell, honestly.

00:38:33,787 --> 00:38:34,957
And you know what?

00:38:34,957 --> 00:38:38,207
Your wild-Eyed enthusiasm
makes you blind.

00:38:38,207 --> 00:38:41,867
Every time a shark went out
here, you just kept talking.

00:38:41,867 --> 00:38:43,117
That is amazing to me.

00:38:43,117 --> 00:38:46,057
I think you really have to go
into the Real world--

00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:47,217
Test this thing--

00:38:47,217 --> 00:38:49,257
Before you ever involve
other investors.

00:38:49,257 --> 00:38:52,057
Barbara, let me clarify
for the rest of the sharks--

00:38:52,057 --> 00:38:53,137
See? You didn't
even take a breath there.

00:38:53,137 --> 00:38:55,257
"Barbara, let me clarify."

00:38:55,257 --> 00:38:57,887
I don't feel listened to.

00:38:57,887 --> 00:38:59,107
I'm so out on this.

00:39:01,887 --> 00:39:04,957
Uh, I put
my whole savings

00:39:04,957 --> 00:39:06,117
into this company.

00:39:06,117 --> 00:39:08,067
The saying is, you know,
life is a cruel teacher.

00:39:08,067 --> 00:39:09,817
She loves to give you
the test first

00:39:09,817 --> 00:39:11,817
and the lesson later.

00:39:11,817 --> 00:39:13,917
And you'll learn
sooner or later. I'm out.

00:39:15,267 --> 00:39:16,887
Hey, Mark.

00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:18,257
So A.E.G.,

00:39:18,257 --> 00:39:19,937
100,000-Plus attendees,

00:39:19,937 --> 00:39:21,017
100,000--

00:39:21,017 --> 00:39:22,867
Shh.

00:39:22,867 --> 00:39:24,117
Calm down.

00:39:24,117 --> 00:39:26,007
Ignore everything
they just said.

00:39:28,857 --> 00:39:29,917
They're 100% wrong.

00:39:29,917 --> 00:39:31,187
(chuckles)

00:39:39,587 --> 00:39:41,567
Four sharks are out.

00:39:41,567 --> 00:39:43,537
Shh.
And Mark Cuban

00:39:43,537 --> 00:39:46,557
is Jillian and Connor's
last chance at getting a deal.

00:39:46,557 --> 00:39:48,537
Just calm down.

00:39:49,807 --> 00:39:51,617
Ignore everything
they just said.

00:39:51,617 --> 00:39:54,233
They're 100% wrong.

00:39:54,233 --> 00:39:56,133
You guys remind me of me

00:39:56,133 --> 00:39:57,543
when I was 21.

00:39:57,543 --> 00:40:00,383
You're trying to win
every battle.

00:40:00,383 --> 00:40:03,113
That's what being competitive
is all about.

00:40:03,113 --> 00:40:04,593
Now I tried
to ask the questions

00:40:04,593 --> 00:40:08,193
that would educate me about
where you're going strategically

00:40:08,193 --> 00:40:10,283
and could I add value.
(chuckles)

00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:11,583
Tell me about
your infrastructure.

00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:13,243
Really quick.
(snaps fingers)

00:40:13,243 --> 00:40:15,233
Ten seconds or less.
What--what do you have?

00:40:15,233 --> 00:40:18,163
So we have a design,

00:40:18,163 --> 00:40:19,413
so we can design New products
in different colors,

00:40:19,413 --> 00:40:21,383
different sizes.

00:40:21,383 --> 00:40:23,113
Great. So you have someone
who can make 'em and build 'em?

00:40:23,113 --> 00:40:24,513
Yeah.
Okay.

00:40:24,513 --> 00:40:26,413
And the 200 you sold at
your web site was how long ago?

00:40:26,413 --> 00:40:28,193
It was six months ago.

00:40:28,193 --> 00:40:29,563
Okay, why have you not continued
to sell them on your web site?

00:40:29,563 --> 00:40:31,233
Because we ran out.
(laughs)

00:40:31,233 --> 00:40:32,393
Okay, so you have $50,000
in the bank.

00:40:32,393 --> 00:40:34,563
Why didn't you use that money
to fulfill the orders?

00:40:34,563 --> 00:40:37,363
Because we--we couldn't
make any more of those.

00:40:37,363 --> 00:40:39,513
That was with a small designer
who did freelance work

00:40:39,513 --> 00:40:42,133
with a supply chain that
Connor put together...

00:40:42,133 --> 00:40:43,343
(laughs) That was amazing
for his first whack at it.

00:40:43,343 --> 00:40:45,283
Okay. Shh.
Don't go on a tangent.

00:40:45,283 --> 00:40:46,483
Okay?

00:40:46,483 --> 00:40:48,493
So you have $50,000
in the bank,

00:40:48,493 --> 00:40:51,183
and you've gone six months
without selling anything?

00:40:51,183 --> 00:40:52,593
We just secured that
a month ago.

00:40:52,593 --> 00:40:55,263
Okay, in your model,
in your business plan,

00:40:55,263 --> 00:40:57,283
you've gone from nothing,
basically,

00:40:57,283 --> 00:40:59,213
to 200,000 units.
Mm-hmm.

00:40:59,213 --> 00:41:01,433
What got you from nothing
to 200,000 units?

00:41:01,433 --> 00:41:03,163
What percentage was on-Line,

00:41:03,163 --> 00:41:05,513
what percentage was
going to have to be retail?

00:41:05,513 --> 00:41:08,463
15% was retail
through the web site.

00:41:08,463 --> 00:41:10,143
85% was--
Okay, you mean on-Line.

00:41:10,143 --> 00:41:11,243
85% was wholesale.

00:41:11,243 --> 00:41:13,283
Or we can change up
that ratio.

00:41:13,283 --> 00:41:15,193
It could be one of those
internet on-Line sensations--

00:41:15,193 --> 00:41:16,433
50/50.
See? But now you're waffling.

00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:18,463
What you just told me is,

00:41:18,463 --> 00:41:20,563
you don't really know
what you're going to do.

00:41:20,563 --> 00:41:22,313
I know who I'm gonna
sell it to...
I mean, what--

00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,583
in the next--
I know those 100,000 units.

00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:25,343
I know. I--look, I get--

00:41:25,343 --> 00:41:27,563
I get
that you believe in it.

00:41:27,563 --> 00:41:30,313
I was hoping I could prove
these fools wrong.

00:41:30,313 --> 00:41:31,393
And you didn't.

00:41:31,393 --> 00:41:32,483
No, unfortunately not.

00:41:32,483 --> 00:41:34,283
If you would've come back
to me

00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:37,313
and said, "'a,' this is
what I'm gonna do--

00:41:37,313 --> 00:41:40,593
'a,' 'b,' 'c,' 'd,'--
to get to 200,000 units"

00:41:40,593 --> 00:41:43,463
and it made
crystal-Clear sense to me,

00:41:43,463 --> 00:41:46,493
the hun--Then the $100,000
is nothing.

00:41:46,493 --> 00:41:48,233
So for that reason, I'm out.

00:41:48,233 --> 00:41:50,193
Can I stop you there
and try again?

00:41:50,193 --> 00:41:51,393
No, I'm out.

00:41:51,393 --> 00:41:53,313
Well, we do have a plan,

00:41:53,313 --> 00:41:55,313
and that--Our last one
was the meeting

00:41:55,313 --> 00:41:57,233
that we had last week,
so that's the first one.

00:41:57,233 --> 00:41:58,333
We have--We--

00:41:58,333 --> 00:42:00,333
Jillian, Jill...

00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:02,113
good luck.

00:42:02,113 --> 00:42:04,343
Go get 'em, guys.

00:42:04,343 --> 00:42:07,533
All right.
Thank you, guys.

00:42:10,543 --> 00:42:13,543
♪♪♪

00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:18,243
You know, in the end, Mark,

00:42:18,243 --> 00:42:19,583
the most important thing
about that pitch is,

00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:21,443
we were right,
and you were wrong.

00:42:21,443 --> 00:42:22,563
End of story.

00:42:22,563 --> 00:42:24,443
On that pitch,
I'll give you that one, Kevin.

00:42:24,443 --> 00:42:26,343
Wow.

00:42:26,343 --> 00:42:27,433
That's a first.
Yep.

00:42:27,433 --> 00:42:29,143
(Barbara)
That is a first.

00:42:29,143 --> 00:42:31,113
Steve jobs said,
"stay hungry, stay foolish."

00:42:31,113 --> 00:42:32,493
And that's exactly
what we're planning to do.

00:42:32,493 --> 00:42:34,533
We're hungry and foolish.
(chuckles)
