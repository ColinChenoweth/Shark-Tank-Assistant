from across the country

00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:10,210

If the sharks hear
a great idea,

First...
(clatters)

00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:02,582
They absorb extra heat
from your coffee

00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:05,318
and make it a drinkable
temperature within minutes.

00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:07,387
And then they release
the heat that they stored

00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,056
and keep it in
the perfect drinking range

00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:10,457
for up to twice as long.

00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:11,925
Wow.

00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,560
Our favorite way to use
coffee joulies

00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,796
is in this vacuum-Insulated
travel mug.

00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:17,864
(sloshing)
in here, you can pour in
coffee as hot as you want,

00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,966
and it'll be the perfect
drinking temperature

00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,635
in five minutes,
and it'll stay that way

00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:23,770
for over five hours.

00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,339
We have five perfection packs
here for you to try out

00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:29,109
with coffee that we poured
over three hours ago.

00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:32,112
What is the right temperature
to drink coffee at?

00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:34,614
The right temperature is
140 degrees fahrenheit.

00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,917
It will not burn your tongue.
It's a pleasant temperature,

00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:39,986
and it gives you good flavor
and aroma for your coffee.

00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,855
Thermoses already
keep things hot.

00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:43,690
But they keep them too hot,

00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,159
especially right when you pour
your coffee into the thermos--

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,095
It'll be too hot
for a long period of time.

00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:49,830
Holy smokes.
Lori, look at this.

00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:50,897
Right.
Three hours ago.

00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,365
Three hours old?
Yep.

00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,134
How does it monitor
the temperature

00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:56,570
when it gets in,
and it retains the heat

00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,905
and monitors how much
it has to give off?

00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,340
There's material
inside the joulies

00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,309
that melts
at 140 degrees fahrenheit.

00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:04,478
So you put it in hot coffee--
Coffee that's poured at 180--

00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:06,446
It absorbs all that
extra energy,

00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:07,714
cooling it down to 140.

00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,783
When it hits 140,
the process reverses,

00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:11,251
releasing the energy
back into the coffee,

00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,652
keeping it hot longer.

00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:14,554
Are you a chemist?
That's fascinating.

00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,223
We're both
mechanical engineers.
We're both--Yeah.

00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:18,558
Oh. What is this made out of?
Is this stainless steel?

00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:20,494
The outside
is 18/10 stainless steel,

00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:23,296
and the inside is a proprietary
phase Change material that's--

00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:24,898
Did you come up with it?

00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:27,367
Uh...
we did not.

00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:28,869
There's a company
that makes it,

00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:30,971
and we like that,
because they've done

00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:32,773
the effort of making sure
it's safe.

00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,808
So, Dave,
what's the response been?
Wait, wait. Let him finish.

00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,109
Let him finish up, Kevin.

00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,677
It's all derived
from plant sources,

00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:39,212
so it's edible.
You can actually eat this stuff.

00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,314
So what is it that--
That's inside?

00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,083
As soon as you sign your n.D.A.,
we can talk about that.
(laughter)

00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,585
We have a design patent
that's been issued,

00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,621
and we have a utility patent
that's pending,

00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,624
and we have, uh, trademarks
in the United States

00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:51,858
and in China.

00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,160
Does this work with tea
as well?

00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,661
Yes.
Yeah. It works with
any hot beverage.

00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,496
Tea, hot chocolate. Someone
put them in oatmeal, we heard.

00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:57,764
People use them in soup.

00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,200
And you only need one
in a--in a mug?

00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,135
One per 4 ounces of coffee
is our guideline.

00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,804
(Lori) One for 4 ounces.
Oh!

00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,639
Yeah.
So I'm, like, plopping
multiple of these.

00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,374
Multiple of them in. There's
five in your coffee right now.

00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:10,277
That's a 16-Ounce
travel mug, and--
There's five in here?

00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:11,511
Wow.
Yeah, there's five
in there.

00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:12,579
So you have to walk around

00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,614
like you got a pack
of marlboros on you.

00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:16,616
I drink three, four cups
a day. I love coffee,

00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,084
but I don't carry a mug

00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,353

jewels around.

00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:21,822

(mark and Lori) Joulies.

00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,857
Joulies. Sorry. So who's
the target market?

00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:26,660
In our past sales,
we've had the most traction

00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,828
as a gift item.

00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,362
Because everyone
drinks coffee,

00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,231

00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:33,200

What did you profit
on the $575,000?

00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,722
Last year our profit
on the books was like $50,000.

00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:58,792
We spent a lot of money
on patents, tooling, legal fees.

00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,493
And you expensed
all of that?
Yeah.

00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,295
We're--We're
cash flow positive.

00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:03,730

00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,798
Over a million dollars.

00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:09,336
Last year was the year
of online sales for us.

00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:11,137
But our focus this year

00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:13,139
is gonna be going
into wholesale accounts.

00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,542

00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:18,612

00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,288
(laughs)

00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:30,056

00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,826
That's right.
(Kevin) Are you gonna

00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:13,833
I think so.

00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,442
I think I can get that
faster into retail

00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,144
and some of the other retailers,
like target.

00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:26,913
You've got three sharks
now under that structure.

00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:29,015
You keep the company.

00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:31,184
There's one--One person
we haven't heard--
(mark) But wait. There's more.

00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,852
We haven't heard from yet.
But wait. There's more.

00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,155
First of all, I think
you're crazy to go retail

00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:36,389
and wholesale.

00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,758
Okay.
Absolutely loony bin nuts.

00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,894
Because your costs
go through the roof.

00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:42,929
Okay.
I'd like to get involved,
but I don't know want to be

00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,165
in the wholesale distribution
business,

00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:47,033
because you lose control
of your own destiny,

00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,235
particularly this early.
Right?

00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,771
You gotta crawl
before you ball. Right?

00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:54,107
And the minute it goes
to bed bath &amp; beyond,

00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:55,775
they control who you are.

00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,877
(Lori) This doesn't make
any sense.

00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:00,513
I've done over $500 million
in retail sales,

00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,682
and the reason?
Because I do exactly

00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:04,684
the opposite
of what mark just said.

00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,186
You get it out as wide
and as fast

00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:07,988
into everybody that you can.

00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,757
You have the whole world
Knowing what joulies is fast.

00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:12,525
If you go with the way
mark was saying,

00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,494
you could crawl along
like a snail forever.

00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,329
You know what?
If They would allow me,

00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,731
I'll come in on this, too,

00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:19,599
to do the retail,
'cause I believe in it.

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,134
And when Lori puts it on,

00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:22,802
then you can do "As seen on tv"
in the stores.

00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:24,337
Are you gonna let him back in?
He seemed--

00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,306
I don't know,
earlier he was kinda...

00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:28,441
(Lori laughs)
Yeah, he was a little--He was
a little poopy, wasn't he?

00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,579
The truth about this guy is,
he is Mr. Retail.

00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:34,714
And even though sometimes
I don't like him,

00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:37,117
I like to make money.

00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:39,719
So enemies become friends
When they can help you.

00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,488
Kevin, let's bring daymond in.
We need daymond on this.

00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:43,490
(Lori) I would bring daymond in
for sure.
I'm happy to have him in.

00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,325
(Kevin) Here's the offer.
Very simple.

00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,594
You get $150,000
from 4 sharks.

00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:50,363
Every time you sell a unit,
give us $6 back.

00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,098
Any unit?
Any unit.

00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:54,567
Even wholesale, where
our margins today are--
Any unit, $6 back.

00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:55,935
You'll get focused on this,

00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,637
because as soon as we get
our money back,

00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,005
it drops to a dollar.

00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,908
That's it. And you keep
100% of the company

00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,943
for when that big coffee company
Comes and says,

00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,212
"I'm buying you now
for an obscene amount of money,"

00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,647
so you can buy suits.

00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:10,083
(mark) right.
So just think about that.

00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,451
First of all, you'd be
an idiot if you bought a suit.

00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:12,919
But--
Do you have to think
about that?

00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,320
Is there an offer that
you'd like to make?
(mark) Sure.

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,122
I'd like to make an offer.
Let's hear it.

00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:19,259
Okay. I'm gonna offer you
$250,000

00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,961
for 12%, no royalties.

00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:24,964
My preference is that
you don't go

00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:27,834
wholesale/retail
and qvc right away,

00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:30,637
because I see this as having
a great opportunity

00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:31,871
for a liquidity event.

00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,873
I see this as being able
to sell the company.

00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:36,009
When you go to sell the company
and they say,

00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:39,312
"Let's look at your numbers,"
first Big old red flag

00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,448
is going to be
a perpetual royalty.

00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:42,882
Doesn't matter
if it's a penny.

00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:45,151
It's not gonna be negotiated
out on a buyout

00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:48,421
as simply as it sounds.
Absolutely will.
Happens every day.

00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,856
Can I finish?

00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:52,392
When you have a company
that is looking to grow,

00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:55,361
you can't be on qvc
every week all the time.

00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,697
Tell that to George Foreman,
who did about $400 million

00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,499
over five years.
And he has to go back
to that environment

00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:00,834
and to--
No, he doesn't.

00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:02,368

It's in every single store

Yeah. We're gonna--

a difference in the offers

Yeah.

in the experience

00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,454

you this advice and offers.
They're all very different.

Yes. Mm-hmm.

Was that an assurance,

00:19:35,855 --> 00:19:38,124

"We really like your sales

00:19:58,978 --> 00:20:00,747
And it's all natural
ingredients,

00:20:00,747 --> 00:20:02,181
because we want to sell to
the whole foods and the mothers.

00:20:02,181 --> 00:20:05,785
Smells really Good. (laughs)

00:20:05,785 --> 00:20:06,219

My kids would love it.

00:20:09,088 --> 00:20:10,790
I think you have a home run
there with the--

00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:13,826

that Teddy smells.
Yeah, I think so, too.

00:20:13,826 --> 00:20:14,193
I see there's a need.

00:20:14,193 --> 00:20:16,763
I'm just wondering
how big a need,

00:20:16,763 --> 00:20:19,799
how much this would catch on.
You don't really know yet.

00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:22,101
You're at the beginnings.
And I have seen bags like this.

00:20:23,536 --> 00:20:25,772

(daymond) aw.

00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,401
I was allergic to house dust.
I used to--

00:21:28,401 --> 00:21:31,070
Every week I'd have to go
get an injection.

00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,606
And I had no idea
Teddy was killing me.

00:21:33,606 --> 00:21:34,240
Seriously.
I wouldn't have hung out
with Teddy so much.

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,876
It's serious.
That's why I really have

00:21:36,876 --> 00:21:38,711

I'm sorry.

00:21:51,391 --> 00:21:56,229
I'll give you the $50,000
for 50% of the business.

00:21:56,229 --> 00:22:00,033
But I have to have
10% of sales...

00:22:00,033 --> 00:22:00,500
(laughs) Kevin.

00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,136
(Kevin) Paid to me
every month.

00:22:03,136 --> 00:22:04,904
Because I'll never get
my cash back.

00:22:04,904 --> 00:22:07,173
And after I get my cash back,

00:22:07,173 --> 00:22:09,108
I'll drop that to 5%.

00:22:09,108 --> 00:22:10,576
Okay.

00:22:10,576 --> 00:22:11,511

what the benefits are

compared to a pillowcase

Oh, yes.

00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,418
So I teamed up
with this manufacturer

00:22:18,418 --> 00:22:22,021
of Washer and dryers--
Frigidaire and electrolux.

00:22:22,021 --> 00:22:23,723
Okay.
They supplied

00:22:23,723 --> 00:22:24,424

Nicole, I'll make it easier.

You've convinced me

00:22:32,732 --> 00:22:33,866
Okay.

00:22:33,866 --> 00:22:34,233
So I want to make you
an offer.

00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:36,402
But is $50,000 enough?

00:22:36,402 --> 00:22:38,304
If you're gonna have
all these purchase order--

00:22:38,304 --> 00:22:42,008
Yeah, I'm gonna need an investor

Here's what I'm willing
to offer.

00:22:46,112 --> 00:22:47,747
Because you're gonna need
more capital...
Mm-hmm.

00:22:47,747 --> 00:22:49,182
And the better you do, obviously
the more capital you need,

00:22:49,182 --> 00:22:51,217
because you want to be able
to hit those $10,000,

$20,000, $50,000

I'm willing to invest
$100,000...

I'll drop the equity ask
from 50% down to 30%,

00:28:59,986 --> 00:29:02,455
It's what doctors use
to freeze off your warts.

00:29:02,455 --> 00:29:04,257
No, it's the same stuff
they used to freeze Han solo.

00:29:04,257 --> 00:29:05,391
Right?
(both) Yeah, exactly.

00:29:05,391 --> 00:29:07,327
In fact, here...
oh!

00:29:07,327 --> 00:29:09,496
There you go.
You're this far away.
That's--

00:29:09,496 --> 00:29:11,764
There you go.
That's the image right there.
Yeah. Yeah.

00:29:11,764 --> 00:29:13,700
What happens if I hire
an 18-year-old

00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,068
and they freeze their hand off?

00:29:15,068 --> 00:29:16,836
Well, we've developed processes
to make it safe.

00:29:16,836 --> 00:29:18,538
We use nozzles
and we use systems

00:29:18,538 --> 00:29:19,906
that are low pressure

00:29:19,906 --> 00:29:22,675
so that they really
don't have the impact.

00:29:22,675 --> 00:29:24,377
Okay, let's get
into the numbers,

00:29:24,377 --> 00:29:27,947
because you're asking
for a lot.
$2.4 million value.

00:29:27,947 --> 00:29:29,616
That's right.
Walk me through
the numbers.

00:29:29,616 --> 00:29:31,317
So what were sales in 2011?

00:29:31,317 --> 00:29:32,986
What do you think
they'll be this year?

00:29:32,986 --> 00:29:36,623
2011, they were $2 million,

00:29:36,623 --> 00:29:38,191
and this year we're projected
to be about $4 million

00:29:38,191 --> 00:29:39,826
by the end of the year.

00:29:39,826 --> 00:29:43,263
What's the capital cost to
set up a 600-Square-Foot unit?

00:29:43,263 --> 00:29:45,932
A typical store
that's full-Blown

00:29:45,932 --> 00:29:49,369
is between $125,000
and $175,000.

00:29:49,369 --> 00:29:51,171
How much of your own money
is into this?

00:29:51,171 --> 00:29:53,640
We've got about $750,000.
Oh.

00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,641
Whoa.
Wow.

00:29:54,641 --> 00:29:55,942
That's a lot of money.

00:29:55,942 --> 00:29:57,577
We just took a loan--
Our first loan out

00:29:57,577 --> 00:29:58,978
for $275,000.

00:29:58,978 --> 00:30:02,749
If it costs about $125,000
to open a store...

00:30:02,749 --> 00:30:04,617
Mm-hmm.
It's been seven years.

00:30:04,617 --> 00:30:06,853
You've only opened up
two corporate stores.

00:30:06,853 --> 00:30:09,355
Where did the $750,000 go?

00:30:09,355 --> 00:30:10,990
Well, a lot of it was
developing this--

00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:13,193
The systems and--
Did you lose a lot of money
along the way?

00:30:13,193 --> 00:30:15,995
Um, a year and a half ago,
we--we partnered

00:30:15,995 --> 00:30:18,731
with someone,
and the management decisions...
Well--

00:30:18,731 --> 00:30:20,767
That he was making
was not right for the company.

00:30:20,767 --> 00:30:24,404
And in order to, um,
to--to leave that situation,

00:30:24,404 --> 00:30:25,405
we needed to buy him out.

00:30:25,405 --> 00:30:26,940
For how much?
(Robert) Wow.

00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,441
$500,000.

00:30:28,441 --> 00:30:29,709
Ohh!
Whoa!

00:30:29,709 --> 00:30:32,845
Whoa.
Things got very chilly
in here.

00:30:32,845 --> 00:30:37,183
Why would you want to take on
another partner right now,

00:30:37,183 --> 00:30:40,553
when you could grow this company
the way you've been doing it?

00:30:40,553 --> 00:30:42,555
Well, there are some problems
that we've had

00:30:42,555 --> 00:30:44,224
in our growth pattern

00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:46,993
that I think that the sharks
Can help us with.

00:30:46,993 --> 00:30:48,494
(Robert) such as?
Yeah, what are the problems?

00:30:48,494 --> 00:30:49,896
(Jerry) Well, locations.

00:30:49,896 --> 00:30:52,665
To get those "a" locations
and to get into stadiums,

00:30:52,665 --> 00:30:54,200
you've got to have
some backing,

00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,835
or else they're not gonna
really take you seriously.

00:30:55,835 --> 00:30:58,071
You want us to strategically
help you

00:30:58,071 --> 00:31:00,506
make a lot of calls and--
And help you with that, right?

00:31:00,506 --> 00:31:02,842
I mean, it's, uh,
it's part of it.

00:31:02,842 --> 00:31:04,777
So, guys, um,
I like the idea.

00:31:04,777 --> 00:31:07,580
I-I just don't know
if I have the hours and the time

00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,115
to give you the money
as well as Come

00:31:09,115 --> 00:31:11,718
and help you work
with this project.

00:31:11,718 --> 00:31:12,719
I'm out.

00:31:12,719 --> 00:31:15,488
Well, thank you.
Okay. Thank you.

00:31:15,488 --> 00:31:18,825
Unfortunately,
the ice cream operator business

00:31:18,825 --> 00:31:20,460
is incredibly crowded.

00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:24,197
I don't believe your business
right now is worth $2.4 million.

00:31:24,197 --> 00:31:26,466
It's interesting.
Right.

00:31:26,466 --> 00:31:28,735
But not enough for me
to invest. I'm out.

00:31:28,735 --> 00:31:30,970
Okay. Thank you.
Okay.

00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:33,673
You lost $500,000
by hiring the wrong guy.

00:31:33,673 --> 00:31:35,708
To me, you're trying
to do the same thing.
I--

00:31:35,708 --> 00:31:37,610
at the same--
You're trying to bring in
people from the outside

00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:40,179
and asking for $300,000.
At the same time,
I'm not sure--

00:31:40,179 --> 00:31:41,881
And my guiding principle
is always

00:31:41,881 --> 00:31:43,483
if it doesn't
make sense to me--
(Jerry) Well, uh--

00:31:43,483 --> 00:31:45,385
Then it doesn't make sense.
Okay, well, let me--

00:31:45,385 --> 00:31:47,654
For that reason,
Jerry, Naomi, I'm out.

00:31:47,654 --> 00:31:49,322
Okay.

00:31:49,322 --> 00:31:51,124
(Lori)
I think it's a great idea.
Right.

00:31:51,124 --> 00:31:52,925
I think you two
are a great, strong,

00:31:52,925 --> 00:31:54,327
willing-to-Do-
Whatever-it-takes team.

00:31:54,327 --> 00:31:57,297
I think you can get there
on your own

00:31:57,297 --> 00:31:59,032
and still own
your whole company.

00:31:59,032 --> 00:32:02,368
And for that reason, I'm out.

00:32:02,368 --> 00:32:03,703
Thanks.

00:32:03,703 --> 00:32:06,005
Appreciate that. Thank you.

00:32:06,005 --> 00:32:07,607
I like the idea. I think
you've got a lot of potential.

00:32:07,607 --> 00:32:08,975
But I don't really want to be

00:32:08,975 --> 00:32:10,276
in the ice cream
franchise business.

00:32:10,276 --> 00:32:11,544
I will eat some more
of your ice cream, though,

00:32:11,544 --> 00:32:12,845
But, um, I'm out.

00:32:12,845 --> 00:32:14,747
Okay.
All right.

00:32:14,747 --> 00:32:16,015
Well, I appreciate that.
Yes, we appreciate
your time.

00:32:16,015 --> 00:32:17,016
Thank you, guys.
Thanks, guys.

00:32:17,016 --> 00:32:18,217
Thank you.

00:32:18,217 --> 00:32:20,286
Oh, well.
(sighs) Yeah.

00:32:20,286 --> 00:32:23,156
We--Uh... we did okay.
(laughs)

00:32:23,156 --> 00:32:25,291
We said everything
we wanted to say.
Yeah.

00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:26,959
And more.
You know? There's not
anything that we left out,

00:32:26,959 --> 00:32:28,328
and, yes, we tried.

Next up are Beau Oyler
and Jared aller

00:32:42,709 --> 00:32:45,111
with a product designed
for urban living.

00:32:51,184 --> 00:32:53,467
Hello.
My name is Beau Oyler.

00:32:53,467 --> 00:32:54,802
And I'm Jared aller.

00:32:54,802 --> 00:32:56,504
And our company is urbio.

00:32:56,504 --> 00:32:57,972
We're asking
for $300,000

00:32:57,972 --> 00:33:00,107
for 12% of our company.

00:33:00,107 --> 00:33:02,109
Inside of each of us is a need

00:33:02,109 --> 00:33:04,178
to connect with nature
in a meaningful way,

00:33:04,178 --> 00:33:07,014
and indoor plants are
a fantastic way of doing this.

00:33:07,014 --> 00:33:08,649
People living in Large homes...

00:33:08,649 --> 00:33:09,951
like all of you guys.

00:33:09,951 --> 00:33:11,552
You've got plenty of space
for plants.

00:33:11,552 --> 00:33:14,021
But for the rest of us
living in small spaces...

00:33:14,021 --> 00:33:15,690
like Beau and myself...

00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,258
and most people in the world,
we simply don't have

00:33:17,258 --> 00:33:19,193
the room for indoor plants.

00:33:19,193 --> 00:33:22,063
So Jared and I put our minds
together and created urbio,

00:33:22,063 --> 00:33:24,198
the modern vertical garden.

00:33:24,198 --> 00:33:26,267
Urbio is
a fully modular system,

00:33:26,267 --> 00:33:28,102
so it can fit
on any wall.

00:33:28,102 --> 00:33:30,238
And these little guys
have a magical twist--

00:33:30,238 --> 00:33:32,373
Super-Strong magnets
that allow it to attach

00:33:32,373 --> 00:33:35,176
to any metal surface,
including our metal wall plates,

00:33:35,176 --> 00:33:37,078
which are super easy
to install.

00:33:37,078 --> 00:33:38,980
(clicks)
Clickety-Clack,
and just like that,

00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:42,183
you can have your own
urbio design for your lifestyle.

00:33:42,183 --> 00:33:43,651
We've been absolutely
blown away

00:33:43,651 --> 00:33:45,620
at the reception
urbio's received.

00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,388
We've been featured
in multiple magazines,

00:33:47,388 --> 00:33:49,156
blogs, and even tv shows.

00:33:49,156 --> 00:33:51,859
And all of this
just in the last five months.

00:33:51,859 --> 00:33:53,628
And the worldwide
response to urbio

00:33:53,628 --> 00:33:55,196
has also been insane.

00:33:55,196 --> 00:33:57,498
We've been sold
in over 50 different countries,

00:33:57,498 --> 00:34:00,334
and the vertical garden is
just the tip of the iceberg.

00:34:00,334 --> 00:34:03,137
We have infinite possibilities
for urbio

00:34:03,137 --> 00:34:04,538
in every room in your home.

00:34:04,538 --> 00:34:07,341
Yeah, such as kitchen,
bathroom, and office.

00:34:07,341 --> 00:34:10,544
But the best part about urbio
is the experience.

00:34:10,544 --> 00:34:12,380
Lori, come on down.

00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,515
We'd like you to have
the experience

00:34:14,515 --> 00:34:17,618
of placing an urbio magnetic pot
up on the wall.

00:34:17,618 --> 00:34:20,688
There's a spot
right there for ya.

00:34:22,023 --> 00:34:23,858
(clicks)
Whoa. It's strong.

00:34:23,858 --> 00:34:25,760
I know, right?
Right.

00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,328
How cool is that?
Very cool.

00:34:27,328 --> 00:34:30,031
If there's one thing
that urbio knows how to do,

00:34:30,031 --> 00:34:31,799
it's how to grow green.

00:34:31,799 --> 00:34:34,902
So we're looking forward
to partnering with you

00:34:34,902 --> 00:34:37,505
so that we can watch
urbio grow.

00:34:37,505 --> 00:34:39,974
Thank you, Lori.
(mark) Hey, guys,
before you get started,

00:34:39,974 --> 00:34:41,475
I get pitched all the time,

00:34:41,475 --> 00:34:44,345
and these guys had
contacted me before

00:34:44,345 --> 00:34:46,213
and--And solicited
an investment from me.

00:34:46,213 --> 00:34:49,684
So I have to disqualify myself
because I know...
Yeah.

00:34:49,684 --> 00:34:52,453
More about this investment
than the other sharks do,

00:34:52,453 --> 00:34:54,388
which gives me
an unfair advantage, so...

00:34:54,388 --> 00:34:56,657
I have to say I'm out,
but pitch away.

00:34:56,657 --> 00:34:58,292
Yeah. We understand.
Wow.

00:34:58,292 --> 00:35:00,861
You said you were blown away
by the response.

00:35:00,861 --> 00:35:03,030
Why don't you blow me away
by your sales?

00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:06,734
We have $125,000 in sales
in the first 4 months.

00:35:07,968 --> 00:35:09,603
Where were you selling?

00:35:09,603 --> 00:35:12,073
We've been selling in--
Through our web site.

00:35:12,073 --> 00:35:14,008
We're in, uh,
about 25 different

00:35:14,008 --> 00:35:16,010
brick-and-Mortar stores
right now.

00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,945
Any big ones
that we would know,

00:35:17,945 --> 00:35:19,513
or more mom-and-Pop?

00:35:19,513 --> 00:35:21,082
We're working on that,
but we're--
Yeah.

00:35:21,082 --> 00:35:22,850
But we have a large
distribution of mom-and-Pops.

00:35:24,151 --> 00:35:25,319
Well, tell me a little bit
about it.

00:35:25,319 --> 00:35:26,420
Like, what would that cost?

00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,823
The urbio vessels
start at about $15

00:35:28,823 --> 00:35:30,691
and go up to about $35.

00:35:30,691 --> 00:35:32,426
To the customer?

00:35:32,426 --> 00:35:34,161
to the customer.
That's full retail.

00:35:34,161 --> 00:35:35,463
Does that include
the back plate?

00:35:35,463 --> 00:35:37,164
And the back plates
are also $15.

00:35:37,164 --> 00:35:39,767
And what about the smaller cups
that you have up there?

00:35:39,767 --> 00:35:41,602
These ones here?
We call these the shorty.

00:35:41,602 --> 00:35:43,671
Shorties. How much are they?
The shorties are 15 bucks.

00:35:43,671 --> 00:35:46,540
And what does it cost you
to make each different piece?

00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:49,210
So, the shorty
costs us $3.50,

00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:51,679
so we have about
a 75% margin.

00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:53,514
Is there anything out there
similar, though?

00:35:53,514 --> 00:35:55,616
There is nothing on the market
that's like this.

00:35:55,616 --> 00:35:58,152
There are lots
of vertical garden products,

00:35:58,152 --> 00:35:59,587
but they have flaws in them.

00:35:59,587 --> 00:36:02,623
They Leak a lot, and when
people try to water 'em

00:36:02,623 --> 00:36:05,359
on the wall, they get moldy
and they stink.

00:36:06,427 --> 00:36:08,829
How did you come up with it?

00:36:08,829 --> 00:36:10,097
We're both trained
industrial designers.

00:36:10,097 --> 00:36:11,065
We've designed products

00:36:11,065 --> 00:36:13,267
that are now
in Williams-Sonoma,

00:36:13,267 --> 00:36:15,469
best buy, target, costco.

00:36:15,469 --> 00:36:17,738
We have a design studio
(Kevin) Yeah?

00:36:17,738 --> 00:36:19,774
At which we design
for clients.

00:36:19,774 --> 00:36:22,376
This here is our first
consumer product company

00:36:22,376 --> 00:36:23,844
that we're launching.

00:36:23,844 --> 00:36:25,713
You see, that's a bit of
a problem for me as an investor,

00:36:25,713 --> 00:36:27,448
'cause I want you focused
on what I'm putting

00:36:27,448 --> 00:36:29,950
my money into,
not some other clients.

00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,719
Hmm.
How do I get you
to stop worrying

00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:34,555
about those people and worrying
about this business full-time?

00:36:34,555 --> 00:36:36,357
We have a great team--
Eight designers.

00:36:36,357 --> 00:36:38,459
They're cranking out
work all the time,

00:36:38,459 --> 00:36:40,428
which is a good thing,
because this is

00:36:40,428 --> 00:36:42,696
an infinitely expandable,
uh, product line.

00:36:42,696 --> 00:36:45,833
But what are you gonna do
with the $300,000 today?

00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:48,436
We have orders pouring in.
Our inventory's flying out.

00:36:48,436 --> 00:36:50,104
We need to order
more inventory.

00:36:50,104 --> 00:36:51,739
So we need working capital.

00:36:51,739 --> 00:36:53,274
We're not asking you
to pay our salaries.

00:36:53,274 --> 00:36:57,178
We're asking you to help us
fill the next orders

00:36:57,178 --> 00:36:58,813
and get more product
in our warehouse.

00:37:02,116 --> 00:37:03,617
I'm gonna make you
an offer, okay?

00:37:03,617 --> 00:37:07,488
I'll give you $300,000
for 20%,

00:37:07,488 --> 00:37:11,091
but you can't take a salary
from this company.

00:37:11,091 --> 00:37:12,626
You have to take a distribution

00:37:12,626 --> 00:37:14,462
that all the shareholders get,

00:37:14,462 --> 00:37:16,831
and you get to decide
when that is.

00:37:16,831 --> 00:37:20,701
I want to put your shoes
in the same position I'm in.

00:37:23,304 --> 00:37:26,273
Let me say this.
I love great design.

00:37:26,273 --> 00:37:31,178
I love the purity of stuff that
is beautiful for what it is.

00:37:31,178 --> 00:37:33,080
I'll make you an offer
with a bit of a twist.

00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,683
Okay.
I'll give you $400,000

00:37:35,683 --> 00:37:37,518
for the same 20%,

00:37:37,518 --> 00:37:39,820
$300,000 for the equity,

00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:42,223
and $100,000 to go out

00:37:42,223 --> 00:37:45,893
and hire a guy
to run this full-time.

00:37:45,893 --> 00:37:47,761
I think you need somebody
to come in

00:37:47,761 --> 00:37:50,498
and quarterback
all the activity and flurry

00:37:50,498 --> 00:37:51,866
that's going on with you.

00:37:51,866 --> 00:37:54,101
You guys can be the brains
behind it,

00:37:54,101 --> 00:37:57,571
but you need somebody there
every day, 24 by 7.

00:37:57,571 --> 00:37:59,340
Yeah.
That's my offer.

00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:02,042
(daymond)
I'll tell you what, guys.

00:38:02,042 --> 00:38:04,044
I think the--I think
the other two offers

00:38:04,044 --> 00:38:06,180
are pretty generous.

00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,482
I just can't understand
that valuation.

00:38:08,482 --> 00:38:10,684
And maybe I'm just a greedy
Savage, 'cause I would ask...
(chuckling)

00:38:10,684 --> 00:38:13,287
Way more than what the other
sharks are offering right now.

00:38:13,287 --> 00:38:14,655
So...

00:38:14,655 --> 00:38:15,823
I'm out.

00:38:15,823 --> 00:38:18,792
Thank you.
Thanks, daymond.

00:38:18,792 --> 00:38:21,195
Do you have any type of
intellectual property on it?

00:38:21,195 --> 00:38:24,932
Do you have a patent?
We have a design
and utility patent pending.

00:38:24,932 --> 00:38:28,168
Are you willing to work to
reduce the cost of the product?

00:38:28,168 --> 00:38:30,137
Yes.
Okay.

00:38:30,137 --> 00:38:32,006
The magnets are a significant
portion of our cost.

00:38:32,006 --> 00:38:35,342
So I took a plane to China,
and I found an awesome,

00:38:35,342 --> 00:38:36,744
um, magnet manufacturer.

00:38:36,744 --> 00:38:38,212
That's in the pipeline
right now,

00:38:38,212 --> 00:38:39,813
and we're reducing our cost.

00:38:39,813 --> 00:38:42,950
Okay. I'll make you an offer.

00:38:45,185 --> 00:38:47,988
$300,000 for 20%.

00:38:47,988 --> 00:38:51,792
And I think you know
that through qvc, drtv,

00:38:51,792 --> 00:38:54,862
and brick-and-Mortar
retail stores and Online,

00:38:54,862 --> 00:38:57,331
we will blow this out there
fast and furious,

00:38:57,331 --> 00:38:58,799
because that is
what I am best at.

00:38:58,799 --> 00:39:00,467
You know what I find
interesting?

00:39:00,467 --> 00:39:03,003
You never talked about
the beauty of the design.
We will. I love it.

00:39:03,003 --> 00:39:04,838
You never talked about
the design.
They know I love it.

00:39:04,838 --> 00:39:06,740
Can't you tell I love it?
Yeah.

00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,576
You guys are cool and hip
and so is your product,

00:39:08,576 --> 00:39:10,778
and that's the focus
of this market.
Oh, my god.

00:39:10,778 --> 00:39:12,813
People that are in small spaces
just starting out

00:39:12,813 --> 00:39:14,682
that want something
really hip.

00:39:14,682 --> 00:39:18,319
People that are watching qvc
are grandmothers.

00:39:18,319 --> 00:39:19,820
Oh, my god.
Face it--

00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,689
Sometimes you remind me
of a golf ball--

00:39:21,689 --> 00:39:24,625
Small, bald, and I want to
hit you 300 feet away from me.
The point is,

00:39:24,625 --> 00:39:26,327
am I wrong?
(laughter)

00:39:26,327 --> 00:39:28,062
(Robert) That was good.
Lori, that was the best line
you've had so far.

00:39:28,062 --> 00:39:30,598
That was really Good.
That was really Good.

00:39:30,598 --> 00:39:33,200
Guys, we have three offers.

00:39:34,501 --> 00:39:35,769
What are you gonna do?

00:39:35,769 --> 00:39:38,772
♪♪♪

00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,349

00:39:48,349 --> 00:39:51,185
but Beau and Jared have
three offers on the table.

00:39:51,185 --> 00:39:52,820

00:40:20,614 --> 00:40:22,349
literally within months.

00:40:22,349 --> 00:40:24,351
I can sell hundreds of thousands
of dollars in minutes,

00:40:24,351 --> 00:40:25,886
but also I have connections

00:40:25,886 --> 00:40:28,389
to all of the retailers
across the country

00:40:28,389 --> 00:40:30,624
and internationally.
Jared, do you know what I hear?

00:40:30,624 --> 00:40:32,593
And I might have better
sourcing for you...
Jared--

00:40:32,593 --> 00:40:34,662
Because I also have
factories and manufacturers

00:40:34,662 --> 00:40:36,263
that I use all over the world.

00:40:36,263 --> 00:40:38,065
Jared, you know what I hear?
I hear--
It is all one-Stop--

00:40:38,065 --> 00:40:40,567
I hear, "me, me, me, me."
This is your design.

00:40:40,567 --> 00:40:42,136
He's not hearing,
"me, me, me, me."
(daymond) Shark fight!
Shark fight!

00:40:42,136 --> 00:40:43,537
This is your design.
It's not a partnership.

00:40:43,537 --> 00:40:45,606
This is what I always do.
Shark fight! Shark fight!

00:40:45,606 --> 00:40:48,142
Thank you for your offers.
These are all great offers,

00:40:48,142 --> 00:40:50,044
and as we look
at all the sharks,

00:40:50,044 --> 00:40:52,446
you guys would be
fantastic partners,

00:40:52,446 --> 00:40:53,981
each of you
for your different aspects.

00:40:53,981 --> 00:40:56,650
So let me sweeten the deal
a little bit more.

00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,352
(laughs)

00:41:01,388 --> 00:41:03,424
This is a purchase order
from the container store.

00:41:03,424 --> 00:41:07,461
18,000 units
just for the first order--

00:41:07,461 --> 00:41:09,129
Nationwide, every store,

00:41:09,129 --> 00:41:12,466
committed end cap
in every single store.

00:41:12,466 --> 00:41:13,701
What's the dollar amount?

00:41:13,701 --> 00:41:16,003
$150,000.

00:41:17,471 --> 00:41:19,473
Here's the thing.

00:41:19,473 --> 00:41:22,176

ooh.

$400,000 for 20%.

I'll split it with you.

00:41:31,685 --> 00:41:34,621
I'll do $400,000 at 17.5%.

00:41:34,621 --> 00:41:37,024
(Kevin) I'm gonna leave
my offer alone.

00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,992
I think I bring
a unique skill to this.

00:41:38,992 --> 00:41:42,463
Anybody can get on
direct selling television.

00:41:42,463 --> 00:41:44,364
Oh, that is so not True.
It's so True.

00:41:44,364 --> 00:41:45,766
I think I bring
a lot of value

00:41:45,766 --> 00:41:48,168
that I want reflected.

00:41:48,168 --> 00:41:50,037
I'm gonna stand firm.

00:41:50,037 --> 00:41:51,538
Yeah.
So, guys, you have--
You have

00:41:51,538 --> 00:41:52,773
three firm offers.
Yes.

00:41:52,773 --> 00:41:55,642
So what are you gonna do?

00:41:59,513 --> 00:42:00,714
(whispers) Lori?
(whispers) Yeah.

00:42:00,714 --> 00:42:03,350
(normal voice)
We're gonna keep our equity.

00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:05,586
Lori, we'd like to accept
your offer.

00:42:05,586 --> 00:42:07,554
Will you be
our business partner?
Great. Yes.

00:42:07,554 --> 00:42:09,089
Love to.
(laughter)

00:42:09,089 --> 00:42:09,723
It's great.
Thank you.

00:42:09,723 --> 00:42:12,092
Awesome.
We're gonna do
great things.

00:42:12,092 --> 00:42:12,793
We're so excited.
Me, too. Me, too.

00:42:12,793 --> 00:42:15,529
Thank you, Lori.
Thank you very much.
Awesome. Thank you so much.

00:42:15,529 --> 00:42:16,864
(mark) Congrats, guys.
All right. Thank you.

00:42:16,864 --> 00:42:18,031
Thank you, guys.
Appreciate it.

00:42:18,031 --> 00:42:19,299
Good luck to you.
Great to be with you.

00:42:19,299 --> 00:42:20,467
I feel like throwing this
at you.

00:42:20,467 --> 00:42:22,536
(laughter)
Sorry.

00:42:22,536 --> 00:42:24,138
Sorry, Robert.
Thank you. Thanks.

00:42:24,138 --> 00:42:26,540
(daymond) Lori...
wow.

00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:30,077
You stood firm,
you called Kevin a golf ball,

00:42:30,077 --> 00:42:32,312
and you made a profit.
That was the best part
of the whole bit.

00:42:32,312 --> 00:42:34,648
You won't be coming golfing
with me.
(laughs)
