00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,102
(Man) The sharks are back

00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:04,638
in an all-new season
of "Shark Tank,"

00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:06,973
where hopeful entrepreneurs
from across the country

00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:09,509
dream of a chance
to secure an investment

00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,177
and gain powerful partners

00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:15,315
to start, grow,
or save their businesses.

00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:17,517
We urge you to catch
this golden opportunity

00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,185
before Pat and I
knock it out of the park.

00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:20,720
If the sharks hear
a great idea,

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,190
they're ready to invest
using their own money...

00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,125
I want to be involved
with this.

00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,394
I think you're gonna hit
a home run with this.

00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:30,130
And they'll fight each other
for a piece of the action.

00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,198
So I'm gonna give you
ten seconds, Chris.

00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,100
Before you do that--
I am not gonna let
this price go up.

00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,636
Oh, he's pulling
an old Mark Cuban.

00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:39,906
But first, the entrepreneurs
must convince a shark

00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:42,175
to invest the full amount
they're asking for

00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:43,376
or they'll walk away
with nothing.

00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,845
I absolutely hate
to see young entrepreneurs

00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:47,447
Getting completely screwed.

00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:48,848
It's sink...

00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:49,716
What is it
we don't know yet?

00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:50,917
Or swim.

00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:52,385
You just got on board
as an opportunist.

00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,453
She's not stupid.

00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:54,654
I think they call me
a mini shark.

00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:58,124
Who are the sharks?

00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:02,929
They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors

00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:04,931
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.

00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,702
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist

00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:12,505
who turned a $10,000 loan
into a software business

00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:15,308
worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:18,044
Barbara Corcoran
went from working

00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:19,980
as a waitress in Manhattan

00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,450
to building the city's
preeminent real estate empire.

00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,653
Daymond John is a fashion mogul
and branding expert

00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:28,922
who grew his homemade
clothing line

00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:32,859
into the globally recognized
fashion brand Fubu.

00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:36,196
Robert Herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,

00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:37,464
is now a technology mogul

00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,132
Who sold his first
internet companies

00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:43,703
for over $350 million.

00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:45,572
And Mark Cuban,

00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:48,375
notorious billionaire
entrepreneur

00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,310
and the outspoken owner
of the Dallas Mavericks.

00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:02,400
First up is Jenny Nigrosh,

00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,602
who believes she can make
the sharks a lot of green with

00:02:04,602 --> 00:02:08,406
her environmentally friendly
business.

00:02:08,406 --> 00:02:10,608
♪♪

00:02:16,433 --> 00:02:18,667
Hello, sharks.
My name is Jennie Nigrosh.

00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:20,700
I'm president
of the green garmento,

00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,102
and I'm here
seeking $300,000

00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:25,905
for 20% equity
in my growing business.

00:02:25,905 --> 00:02:29,442
How many of you have ever had to
struggle with a twist tie

00:02:29,442 --> 00:02:33,646
or search for clothing that was
suffocating inside plastic?

00:02:33,646 --> 00:02:35,448
You're not alone.

00:02:35,448 --> 00:02:38,250
Every year, U.S. dry cleaners

00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,922
process 1.4 billion
items of clothing,

00:02:42,922 --> 00:02:46,392
creating an estimated
300 million pounds

00:02:46,392 --> 00:02:49,295
of single-use plastic
that invade our landfills

00:02:49,295 --> 00:02:51,831
and waterways,
threatening our marine life,

00:02:51,831 --> 00:02:53,833
including sharks...
(laughs)

00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,568
And wildlife,

00:02:55,568 --> 00:02:56,836
including Mr. Wonderful.

00:02:56,836 --> 00:02:59,638
(laughter)

00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:01,307
The green garmento has
multi functions

00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:05,444
to help you create a cleaner
closet and a cleaner planet.

00:03:05,444 --> 00:03:08,247
When you get the bag home,
simply turn it upside-Down.

00:03:08,247 --> 00:03:10,649
It'll hang from
any hook in your house.

00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:11,851
And it's
a space-Saving hamper,

00:03:11,851 --> 00:03:14,920
or it'll fit
into a hamper frame.

00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,389
Throw your dry cleaning in.

00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:17,990
When you're ready
to go to the cleaner,

00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,659
simply cinch the bag,

00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:23,562
carry it like a duffel
or a yoga bag,

00:03:23,562 --> 00:03:24,563
bring it to
your dry cleaner

00:03:24,563 --> 00:03:27,166
and ask for them
to save the bag,

00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,434
keep it with your clothes.

00:03:28,434 --> 00:03:30,102
And when you get
your clothes returned,

00:03:30,102 --> 00:03:33,506
the bag has magically morphed

00:03:33,506 --> 00:03:35,708
into this gorgeous
hanging garment bag,

00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,911
and your clothes are hanging
gently inside,

00:03:38,911 --> 00:03:41,981
and not a single-use
plastic bag in sight.

00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:45,918
Sharks, sometimes the biggest
ideas truly are the simplest.

00:03:45,918 --> 00:03:48,721
Please help the world
to be fantastic,

00:03:48,721 --> 00:03:51,457
use less plastic,

00:03:51,457 --> 00:03:53,259
and invest
in the green garmento.

00:03:53,259 --> 00:03:54,360
Cool idea.
How do I make money?

00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,429
Right now
dry cleaning packaging

00:03:56,429 --> 00:03:59,765
is about a $200 million
a year business.

00:03:59,765 --> 00:04:00,766
This month, we're gonna reach

00:04:00,766 --> 00:04:03,035
our million-dollar mark
in sales.

00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:04,036
Whoa.

00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:05,571
What about
the last 12 months?

00:04:05,571 --> 00:04:08,374
Just this year,
we're at about $260,000.

00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:10,643
We have projected
just under $400,000.

00:04:10,643 --> 00:04:13,179
Do I pay for the bag
as the consumer,

00:04:13,179 --> 00:04:14,647
or does the dry cleaning shop
pay for it?

00:04:14,647 --> 00:04:16,382
Depends where
you're buying it.

00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:17,850
Most likely, you'd buy it
from your dry cleaner,

00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:18,851
and they buy it from us.

00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:20,653
Do you sell
to dry cleaners?

00:04:20,653 --> 00:04:22,922
We sell to dry cleaners
all over the country.
What do you sell 'it for?

00:04:22,922 --> 00:04:25,524
Um, they are in the $4 range,

00:04:25,524 --> 00:04:26,926
and then we print
their logos on them.

00:04:26,926 --> 00:04:29,829
So we also--We do mostly
customized bags.

00:04:29,829 --> 00:04:31,096
What do they cost you
to make?

00:04:31,096 --> 00:04:34,500
There's two things my mama
never told me to talk about,

00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,568
and that's my age and how much
my bags cost. (chuckles)

00:04:35,568 --> 00:04:37,436
No. Come on now.
How are we gonna know?

00:04:37,436 --> 00:04:38,170
You can't hold that back.

00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,039
But did mama tell you you ain't
gonna get an investment?

00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:42,508
(laughs) And my mama's
from Boston,

00:04:42,508 --> 00:04:43,242
so it's weird
that she'd talk like that.

00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:44,910
Um...
(laughs)

00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,579
They are under $2.

00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:48,581
Do they charge me more...

00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:50,516
no.
As opposed to plastic?

00:04:50,516 --> 00:04:51,317
Which is exactly what
my dry cleaner did.

00:04:51,317 --> 00:04:53,252
He came out with these bags,

00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:55,254
and I keep losing them.

00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:56,989
And every time I lose them,
they charge me money for it.

00:04:56,989 --> 00:04:59,592
Okay.
Is--Is that one of the models

00:04:59,592 --> 00:05:00,526
that people are using?

00:05:00,526 --> 00:05:02,828
That's not normally what
we would like to have happen.

00:05:02,828 --> 00:05:05,631
First of all, your dry cleaner
Should be giving you free bags

00:05:05,631 --> 00:05:07,366
because you're Mr. Herjavec,
but...
that's True.

00:05:07,366 --> 00:05:09,768
Um, the, uh...
(laughs) No, he should be...

00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,570
well, here's the other
problem, Jennie--
Charging you double
is what he should be doing.

00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,104
But are--Robert, are you
saying this actually

00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:13,973
had happened to you?
Yeah.

00:05:13,973 --> 00:05:15,641
It's ridiculous.
Yep.

00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:16,842
Here's the problem
when I looked into it--

00:05:16,842 --> 00:05:19,111
Most dry cleaners
are relatively small.
Mm-hmm.

00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:22,314
So they don't actually do
the dry cleaning at the shop.

00:05:22,314 --> 00:05:24,850
Mm-hmm.
The problem was, they said,
actually sorting.

00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,785
The idea of you bringing
your own bag

00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,053
and them having to put
your stuff

00:05:28,053 --> 00:05:31,323
in your bag
was too much time for them.

00:05:31,323 --> 00:05:32,258
These plastic bags,
however,

00:05:32,258 --> 00:05:34,493
are costing them
5 to 15 cents each.

00:05:34,493 --> 00:05:36,896
So the sale
is to the dry cleaner,

00:05:36,896 --> 00:05:38,230
and your pitch to them is,

00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:38,764
"you're actually
gonna save money"?

00:05:38,764 --> 00:05:43,035
if one person rotates
their two bags per year,

00:05:43,035 --> 00:05:45,771
that is a $35- to $45-Saving

00:05:45,771 --> 00:05:47,640
on just the one--

00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,173
And they pocket that margin?
They keep that money?

00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:49,909
Absolutely.
Yes.

00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:51,510
And then they resale these.

00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,378
These bags retail
on our web site for $9.99.

00:05:52,378 --> 00:05:53,979
But currently now

00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,648
how many competitors
do you have

00:05:55,648 --> 00:05:57,850
and how big are they
in relevance to you?

00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,385
One, really.

00:05:59,385 --> 00:05:59,919
It's a totally different bag.

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,588
They aren't at all
consumer-driven.

00:06:02,588 --> 00:06:04,390
We also have the patent
on these bags.

00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,925
We have 18 claims
in a utility patent.

00:06:05,925 --> 00:06:07,660
I love a clear bag.

00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,025
Mm-hmm.

00:06:08,025 --> 00:06:08,925
I could look in my closet

00:06:08,925 --> 00:06:11,060
and see exactly
what I'm pulling out...

00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,062
Right.
Without opening a bag
to see what's inside--One.

00:06:13,062 --> 00:06:15,331
And secondly, I covet
these little plastic bags

00:06:15,331 --> 00:06:19,202
and save them
for when I travel because...

00:06:19,202 --> 00:06:20,403
seriously?
I find if I group--

00:06:20,403 --> 00:06:23,940
Because the clothing wrinkles
without the use of the bag.

00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,142
So if you were to put
a man's suit, a woman's dress...

00:06:26,142 --> 00:06:28,144
Right.
And a pair of trousers in there

00:06:28,144 --> 00:06:30,413
without the plastic
on each one,

00:06:30,413 --> 00:06:31,814
they will wrinkle.

00:06:31,814 --> 00:06:34,350
It's true. Men's suits, if you
put the plastic between them,

00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,885
don't wrinkle.

00:06:35,885 --> 00:06:37,220
I never knew that.
(Kevin) Yeah, it's true.

00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:37,925
Our bags are breathable.

00:06:37,925 --> 00:06:39,925
Would you rather
search through that

00:06:39,925 --> 00:06:41,992
or would you rather have
your stuff neatly hanging?

00:06:41,992 --> 00:06:43,593
Jennie, can we focus
on the numbers for a second?
Sure.

00:06:43,593 --> 00:06:45,862
You say you're gonna make
$400,000 this year.

00:06:45,862 --> 00:06:47,797
After you pay yourself
a normalized salary,

00:06:47,797 --> 00:06:49,933
how much money will be
at the bottom line?

00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:51,134
We are not in profit yet.

00:06:51,134 --> 00:06:53,336
Who is "We"?

00:06:53,336 --> 00:06:56,873
Oh, my husband and I. We run
the business together. Um--

00:06:56,873 --> 00:06:58,742
So on $400,000 in sales,
you're not making any money?
Correct.

00:06:58,742 --> 00:07:00,010
(Daymond) Ooh.

00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:00,810
We are not--
Why?

00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,279
It's a brand-New category.
Why?

00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,613
Uh, it is a new business.

00:07:03,613 --> 00:07:04,948
You know, we're just
four years in,

00:07:04,948 --> 00:07:06,283
and to have--
four years?

00:07:06,283 --> 00:07:08,952
You haven't made any money
in four years?

00:07:08,952 --> 00:07:11,154
Um...

And as former players
ourselves,

00:14:14,297 --> 00:14:15,898
we spent the past two years
building our brand

00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:18,901
through our contacts in both
major and minor league baseball

00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:21,304
with over 20 major league teams
currently using the product,

00:14:21,304 --> 00:14:23,239
including the Chicago Cubs
and Boston Red Sox.

00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:25,308
In the U.S. alone,

00:14:25,308 --> 00:14:28,411
chewing tobacco is
a $4.5 billion-a-year industry.

00:14:28,411 --> 00:14:31,948
It is estimated that over
half of all users

00:14:31,948 --> 00:14:33,683
make at least one attempt
to quit their habit.

00:14:33,683 --> 00:14:36,018
With your help and experience,
we can take our product

00:14:36,018 --> 00:14:39,355
into every gas station
and convenience store,

00:14:39,355 --> 00:14:42,291
not only in the U.S.,
but in the world.

00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,292
So, sharks, we urge you

00:14:43,292 --> 00:14:46,095
to catch this golden opportunity
before Pat and I...

00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:48,364
knock it out of the park.
(bat cracks ball)

00:14:48,364 --> 00:14:49,565
(Barbara chuckles)

00:14:49,565 --> 00:14:51,834
So before hand out some samples,
we'll give you a quick demo

00:14:51,834 --> 00:14:53,436
in case you're not familiar
with how to use the product.

00:14:54,637 --> 00:14:56,839
Open it up,

00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,375
take out a pouch or two,

00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,377
place it in your mouth.

00:15:01,377 --> 00:15:03,880
Let it sit for 20 minutes,

00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,548
half-hour, 45 minutes--

00:15:05,548 --> 00:15:06,816
Whatever you need
to get your energy kick.

00:15:06,816 --> 00:15:09,819
When you're done,
take it out, throw it away.

00:15:09,819 --> 00:15:12,155
And that's it.

00:15:12,155 --> 00:15:14,090
So now Matt's gonna pass out
our best seller--

00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:16,959
The mint chocolate flavor
that you guys can all try.

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:17,960
And then we've got
the cinnamon roll and mocha

00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,229
that you can open up and try
or check out the aroma.

00:15:20,229 --> 00:15:22,899
(sniffs) whoa.

00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:25,234
So you can put it kinda
right in your cheek.

00:15:25,234 --> 00:15:26,102
You don't actually
Chew on it.

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:30,506
Okay, so this is starting
to work now.

00:15:30,506 --> 00:15:32,708
I can taste the chocolaty...

00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,310
(both) Yeah.

00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,745
(Kevin) Coffee thing going here.
That's the idea.

00:15:35,745 --> 00:15:37,814
How--How long
will the pouch last?

00:15:37,814 --> 00:15:39,215
It can go up to 45 minutes
or so as well. I mean, it's--

00:15:39,215 --> 00:15:41,017
How much coffee equivalent
in one pouch?

00:15:41,017 --> 00:15:43,419
So one pouch is about
a quarter cup of coffee.

00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:45,154
But one can has got
about 20 pouches,

00:15:45,154 --> 00:15:47,490
which is four or five
cups of coffee.

00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:48,491
One is just a quarter cup?

00:15:48,491 --> 00:15:50,293
'cause I gotta tell you, it--
it feels a lot stronger.

00:15:50,293 --> 00:15:52,895
It's strong. Yeah, Yeah.
Yeah, right.

00:15:52,895 --> 00:15:54,096
So wait. How'd you guys
get into this?

00:15:54,096 --> 00:15:56,165
So Matt and I met
at Cal Poly.

00:15:56,165 --> 00:15:57,500
We were both
business finance students

00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,968
playing baseball together.

00:15:58,968 --> 00:16:00,837
Matt was a catcher.

00:16:00,837 --> 00:16:02,371
He was actually drafted
by the Chicago Cubs.

00:16:02,371 --> 00:16:04,040
We were working
on this econ project,

00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,242
and we were procrastinating,
as most college students do.

00:16:06,242 --> 00:16:09,145
We, uh, ended up not having
much in our pantries late night,

00:16:09,145 --> 00:16:10,947
and we needed some sort
of energy kick.

00:16:10,947 --> 00:16:12,281
So what did we do?

00:16:12,281 --> 00:16:13,015
We actually took
coffee grounds--

00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:15,952
Regular just coffee grounds--
And put it in our mouth.

00:16:15,952 --> 00:16:18,087
Ew!

00:16:18,087 --> 00:16:19,222
So after ten minutes or so,
we look at each other.

00:16:19,222 --> 00:16:20,556
We kind of smile and we say,

00:16:20,556 --> 00:16:21,224
"Yeah, we kind of feel
an energy kick,"

00:16:21,224 --> 00:16:23,226
but we got all these coffee
grounds all over our teeth--

00:16:23,226 --> 00:16:25,161
And we just started
brainstorming right away.

00:16:25,161 --> 00:16:27,497
And we said, "why don't we
come up with a prototype?"

00:16:27,497 --> 00:16:29,365
Next thing we knew, there was
a flyer on our campus...
Yeah.

00:16:29,365 --> 00:16:31,234
That said, "Have a cool idea?
Free pizza."

00:16:31,234 --> 00:16:33,636
So being starving
college students...
(Robert laughs)

00:16:33,636 --> 00:16:36,572
Yeah, we went down,
filled out a questionnaire.

00:16:36,572 --> 00:16:37,907
Next thing you knew,
we were pitching

00:16:37,907 --> 00:16:39,242
at a business plan
competition,

00:16:39,242 --> 00:16:40,109
had some seed money,

00:16:40,109 --> 00:16:42,912
And, uh, and launched
our product at spring training.

00:16:43,746 --> 00:16:45,481
So do you have sales today?

00:16:45,481 --> 00:16:47,483
So in 2010 we did $3,500.

00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,235
Matt and I were thinking at
the end of the baseball season,

00:16:51,235 --> 00:16:52,970
it's time to get
a 9-to-5 job.

00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,972
Two days after
the San Francisco Giants

00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:55,505
won the world Series,

00:16:55,505 --> 00:16:57,641
we got a call from
their manager Bruce Bochy.

00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,710
He said, "guys, I've been
using your product.

00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:02,512
It might be saving my life.
I wish you guys the best."

00:17:02,512 --> 00:17:03,647
(singsongy) Bingo!

00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,251
We took that as the kick
in the pants to say,

00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:08,518
"All right, we gotta make
this product meet the idea."

00:17:08,518 --> 00:17:11,521
And we proceeded to find
new manufacturing,

00:17:11,521 --> 00:17:13,190
raised a little bit
of financing.

00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:16,827
So basically last year in 2011,
we did $135,000.

00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:20,564
And this year we are on track to
do $300,000 by--By year's end.

00:17:20,564 --> 00:17:21,899
Wow.

00:17:23,233 --> 00:17:25,369
So tell us about
the cost issues.

00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:26,837
For retail,
direct to consumer,

00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,640
we--We like to offer the cans
at about $3.99.

00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,042
Is that equivalent to what
tobaccy would cost?

00:17:32,042 --> 00:17:35,579
Tobacco can range from,
on the low side, $3.50,

00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:37,714
to up to $7 with taxes.

00:17:37,714 --> 00:17:40,183
What are you gonna sell it
to distribution for?

00:17:40,183 --> 00:17:42,119
$2.69 per can.

00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:42,786
And what do you make it for?

00:17:42,786 --> 00:17:45,522
Last year the cost per can
was $1.30.

00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:48,358
This year, it's been around
$1.24, $1.25.

00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,694
And we're hoping to drop it
at least below $1.10

00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,496
by the end of the year.

00:17:52,496 --> 00:17:55,032
(Barbara) Hey, Matt and Pat,
I love your energy.

00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:55,899
I think you have great energy.

00:17:55,899 --> 00:17:57,367
I can't imagine you not selling
this product, frankly.

00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,236
I get it.

00:17:59,236 --> 00:18:00,237
But it's just not a product
that I can relate to--

00:18:00,237 --> 00:18:03,040
Chewing something in my mouth
like this--So I'm out.

00:18:06,777 --> 00:18:10,180
Hey, guys, you're--You're
creating a new category, okay?

00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,181
And this is wonderful,
and you got a lot of energy,

00:18:11,181 --> 00:18:12,849
and it's smart.

00:18:12,849 --> 00:18:14,117
But one of the problems is,

00:18:14,117 --> 00:18:16,453
coffee companies
have a lot of coffee.

00:18:16,453 --> 00:18:18,655
If you prove out this category,
why wouldn't they crush you

00:18:18,655 --> 00:18:21,058
like the cockroaches
you are right now?

00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:24,027
What you need is capital.

00:18:24,027 --> 00:18:25,162
You need money to fire it up,

00:18:25,162 --> 00:18:27,164
and you gotta get
into retail faster.

00:18:27,164 --> 00:18:28,899
You don't want to wait until
the coffee guys figure it out

00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:29,766
and come after you.

00:18:29,766 --> 00:18:33,170
You want to get the brand out
in every store you possibly can.

00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:33,637
You need money.

00:18:33,637 --> 00:18:36,707
Why don't I provide you
with $100,000?

00:18:36,707 --> 00:18:39,643
And the way
you pay me back is,

00:18:39,643 --> 00:18:43,046
every time you sell a tin,
you give me a quarter.

00:18:43,046 --> 00:18:43,714
I'm gonna make it easy.

00:18:43,714 --> 00:18:46,316
I'm not gonna ask
for any equity at all.

00:18:46,316 --> 00:18:48,051
Maybe I'm your guy.
I'm your bank.

00:18:48,051 --> 00:18:49,252
Perhaps, yeah.

00:18:50,988 --> 00:18:52,723
(Daymond) Are you looking for
solely capital?

00:18:52,723 --> 00:18:53,657
Or are you looking for

00:18:53,657 --> 00:18:55,892
the strategic relationship?

00:18:55,892 --> 00:18:58,428
Strategic relationship.
The strategic relationship
is of course valuable to us.

00:18:58,428 --> 00:18:59,496
We know baseball, we know our
product, we know the numbers.

00:18:59,496 --> 00:19:01,631
Distribution
is that missing link.

00:19:01,631 --> 00:19:03,300
And we're doing our homework,

00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,968
But someone who can
expedite that process--

00:19:04,968 --> 00:19:07,637
Pat, honestly, I know
nothing about chewing tobacco.

00:19:07,637 --> 00:19:08,638
But I want to be involved
with this.

00:19:08,638 --> 00:19:11,508
I think you're gonna hit
a home run with this.

00:19:13,977 --> 00:19:15,846
I'll give you the $75,000

00:19:15,846 --> 00:19:17,781
for... 15%,

00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:21,585
but I really would like Daymond
in on the deal with me.

00:19:21,585 --> 00:19:23,253
Not because I need the money,

00:19:23,253 --> 00:19:24,521
but I think he can do
the distribution.

00:19:24,521 --> 00:19:27,591
I mean, that's his specialty.

00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,162
I'm okay with Robert on that

00:19:32,162 --> 00:19:32,829
because this is
such a good deal,

00:19:32,829 --> 00:19:35,098
and you guys--
You guys know your stuff.

00:19:35,098 --> 00:19:36,299
So what exactly
are you offering here?

00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:38,168
So $75,000,

00:19:38,168 --> 00:19:41,705
37.5 from each of us,
for 15%.

00:19:41,705 --> 00:19:43,840
Why give up so much now

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,043
when in a year, after I help
you get distribution,

00:19:46,043 --> 00:19:47,044
it'll be worth ten times more?

00:19:47,044 --> 00:19:48,779
And I won't take any equity.

00:19:50,914 --> 00:19:51,581
That's why they call me
Mr. Wonderful.

00:19:51,581 --> 00:19:54,251
I know what you need
and when you need it.

00:19:54,251 --> 00:19:56,253
Yeah, you're definitely
correct in that sense.

00:19:56,253 --> 00:19:58,121
I-I don't think we're--
Of course I'm correct.

00:19:58,588 --> 00:20:00,257
Why give up any equity?

00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,827
Mark, do you--
Mark, mark,
do you have anything

00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,762
you'd like to add
to the conversation?
(laughs)

00:20:08,231 --> 00:20:09,766
Look, guys,

00:20:09,766 --> 00:20:12,903
in any sport, you can
play small or you can go big.

00:20:12,903 --> 00:20:15,105
I see
tobacco replacement products

00:20:15,105 --> 00:20:17,507
as a medium-Sized industry.

00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,576
I see you guys carving out
a nice niche.

00:20:19,576 --> 00:20:20,577
But like I always say,
you know,

00:20:20,577 --> 00:20:23,780
the most valuable asset I need
to get a return on is my time.

00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,449
And the return on time
just isn't there.

00:20:25,449 --> 00:20:27,384
So for that reason, I'll make it
easier for these guys,

00:20:27,384 --> 00:20:29,986
and I'll go out.

00:20:29,986 --> 00:20:32,656
Okay.

00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,432
Daymond and Robert,
would you guys be willing to

00:20:42,432 --> 00:20:45,102
up the cash to $100,000

00:20:45,102 --> 00:20:48,638
for 15% equity
and go in on the deal 50-50?

00:20:48,638 --> 00:20:51,641
Would you be willing
to up the equity?

00:20:51,641 --> 00:20:55,045
'cause that's all I was
gonna say as well.

00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:58,048
It'd be--It'd be hard
to do that without more cash.

00:21:01,118 --> 00:21:03,120
Guys, I'm not gonna do it.

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,788
And I'll tell you why
I'm not gonna do it.

00:21:04,788 --> 00:21:07,257
With what I'm bringing
to the table,

00:21:07,257 --> 00:21:10,694
the $25,000 is neither
here nor there.

00:21:10,694 --> 00:21:12,229
Over the long run,

00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,096
the $25,000 is not gonna
make the difference.

00:21:13,096 --> 00:21:15,165
Yeah, you're step--
You're stepping over dollars

00:21:15,165 --> 00:21:16,500
to save pennies right now.

00:21:19,503 --> 00:21:22,105

For 15%.

00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,452
I'm gonna stay with that.

00:21:35,452 --> 00:21:38,188
It's equity versus a royalty.

and you wanna
keep your drinks cold.

00:22:51,956 --> 00:22:52,757
How would you keep
those cool?

00:22:52,757 --> 00:22:55,427
I'd use an ice chest.
Okay.

00:22:55,427 --> 00:22:56,761
Now you're ready to enjoy
one of those drinks.

00:22:56,761 --> 00:22:58,096
You take it out
of your ice chest

00:22:58,096 --> 00:23:00,298

the simplest process.

It's just ice and water
in a cup.

He takes the drink out of
his ice chest in the sun,

00:23:15,046 --> 00:23:17,182
he simply slides it
into his cold snap,

yes.
And we would own 100%
of the patent or property.

Mm-hmm.

a 12% royalty.

00:23:46,177 --> 00:23:47,512
Correct.

well, if you take 100%

you will be doing that part.

Now because the important part

00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:00,091

have been sold.

00:24:07,432 --> 00:24:09,834
How did you sell them?
In the promotional products
industry.

00:24:09,834 --> 00:24:12,303
And, uh, they g--They paid us
a licensing fee at that time,

00:24:12,303 --> 00:24:13,838
and it was 10%.
(Robert)
so you've already got sales.

00:24:13,838 --> 00:24:15,039
Is that deal over?

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,708
Yes, it is. It's over.
That deal is over.

00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:18,510
What happened to that deal?

00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,577
Well, we struck
that deal with

00:24:19,577 --> 00:24:21,913
the largest promotional company
in the United States.

00:24:21,913 --> 00:24:24,182
Unfortunately,
unbeknownst to us,

00:24:24,182 --> 00:24:26,251
that company was going
under bankruptcy.

00:24:26,251 --> 00:24:28,987
So they really actually
mismanaged the product.

00:24:28,987 --> 00:24:31,556
There's inventory sitting
in Houston, waiting to be sold.

00:24:31,556 --> 00:24:33,625
How much inventory?
We have 20,000 units
of inventory.

00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:35,493
20,000 units of inventory.
Mm-hmm.

00:24:35,493 --> 00:24:37,362
How much does each unit cost?

00:24:37,362 --> 00:24:39,364
Uh, they cost a little bit
over a dollar to make.

00:24:39,364 --> 00:24:41,232
Can we see a couple of units,
please?
Yeah, absolutely.

00:24:43,234 --> 00:24:45,303
(Robert) So, Carlos,
my dad always told me,

00:24:45,303 --> 00:24:48,907
if it's too good to be true,
it's too good to be true.

00:24:48,907 --> 00:24:52,510
You've licensed it. You've
created it. You've got sales.

00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,578
I mean, why aren't you doing
the heavy lifting?

00:24:53,578 --> 00:24:54,913
(Daymond) You don't have
too many sales

00:24:54,913 --> 00:24:56,981
'cause he still has inventory,
Robert.

00:24:56,981 --> 00:24:59,717
Why are you telling us that
you can't sell your own product?

00:24:59,717 --> 00:25:01,452
What is it we don't know yet

00:25:01,452 --> 00:25:03,388
and we're gonna find out
in two seconds?

00:25:03,388 --> 00:25:05,023
No, Kevin, we're not. Before
when it was launched prior,

00:25:05,023 --> 00:25:07,225
we didn't not own the tooling.

00:25:07,225 --> 00:25:08,159
In order to get it to

00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,629
the promotional products
industry, we spent $200,000.

00:25:11,629 --> 00:25:12,764
And it augmented us
pretty inefficiently.

00:25:12,764 --> 00:25:15,967
What did you spend
the $200,000 on?

00:25:15,967 --> 00:25:17,502
We--We went to mexico.

00:25:17,502 --> 00:25:19,037
We--We did prototypes first.

00:25:19,037 --> 00:25:22,507
We did tooling,
uh, worked on the patent.

00:25:22,507 --> 00:25:24,562
You didn't spend the money well.
We had attorneys for the --

00:25:24,562 --> 00:25:25,897
We didn't
spend the money well.

00:25:25,897 --> 00:25:28,300
We spent it in a--
We spent it very poorly.

00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:31,330
And how much revenue
have you gotten back

00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,666
through your licensing
and any other efforts?

00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:36,936
We got 10 cents, uh,
10 cents per Unit.

00:25:36,936 --> 00:25:37,503
(Robert) What was
the total dollar you got?

00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:40,106
What was--
We got $25,000 from that time.

00:25:40,106 --> 00:25:42,442
That's all you've made?
Mm-hmm. Yeah, during that--

00:25:42,442 --> 00:25:44,577
Yeah, from promotional Products,
that's all we made.

00:25:44,577 --> 00:25:46,312
That's correct.
How long ago did
the other company go bankrupt?

00:25:46,312 --> 00:25:48,381
This was in 2000...
2004.

00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:49,715
So it's been sitting around
forever then.
(Scott speaks indistinctly)

00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,250
It's been sitting around
for a little bit.

00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,251
(Robert) Oh, I thought
this was, like, now.

00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:55,388
So you haven't been able to sell
those units?

00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:57,523
(Scott and Carlos
speak indistinctly)
No, no, no,
this is getting nasty, guys,

00:25:57,523 --> 00:25:58,191
no, no, no, Daymond, Daymond,

00:25:58,191 --> 00:26:00,793
maybe we're not doing
a good job communicating.

00:26:00,793 --> 00:26:02,395
You're doing a horrible job,
don't worry about it, okay?
(mark laughs)

00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:05,064
it--There was a period
of inactivity. We--We...

00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,732
eight years. Eight years.
(Scott speaks indistinctly)

00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:09,402
(Robert) What did you do
in the eight years, Scott?

00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:10,403
Well...
well--

00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:13,506
You put it on ice, right?
(mark, Barbara,
and Robert laugh)

00:26:13,506 --> 00:26:15,508
We didn't put it on pause,
and I'll tell you why.

00:26:15,508 --> 00:26:19,579
So we stopped for a little bit.
We had spent $200,000.

00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:21,981
Now we're a little bit older,
a little bit Wiser,

00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:24,317
and have a little bit more
powder in our--In our storage.

00:26:24,317 --> 00:26:26,252
So we were relaunching,
and we recognized

00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:28,054
the opportunity that
you guys could accomplish.

00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:29,388
So this, for me, feels like

00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:31,924
you took a cold body
out of the closet,

00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,860
you're wheeling it back in,
you want us to buy in.

00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:37,797
If you're not excited about
running your business...

00:26:37,797 --> 00:26:39,265
(speaks indistinctly)
(chuckles) I can't get excited.

00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:41,868

I'm--I'm sorry that we gave--

00:26:41,868 --> 00:26:42,668

I'm sorry. I'm out.

00:26:44,637 --> 00:26:46,305
Barbara, it--
It's not a cold body.

00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:48,107
It--Well...
Okay, so, you guys,

00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,243
now--Now you've actually
created more confusion

00:26:50,243 --> 00:26:53,333
because you just spent
$20,000 more

00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:54,934
to get 20,000 units
of inventory.

00:26:54,934 --> 00:26:57,003
Mm-hmm.
Why?

00:26:57,003 --> 00:27:00,406
Because today, we have the time,
we have the resources.

00:27:00,406 --> 00:27:02,075
And we are fully committed.

00:27:02,075 --> 00:27:03,743
Believe me, there's nobody
that's more committed to this--

00:27:03,743 --> 00:27:05,078
you can't--You are not
fully committed to a product

00:27:05,078 --> 00:27:06,746
where you're saying,

00:27:06,746 --> 00:27:08,348
"We're just gonna give you
the company for $50,000."

00:27:10,616 --> 00:27:11,484
I don't have a problem
with the approach.

00:27:11,484 --> 00:27:15,688
What I have a problem with
is this thing died years ago,

00:27:15,688 --> 00:27:17,457
and now you're trying
to pawn it off on us.

00:27:17,457 --> 00:27:20,727
It--It didn't die.
It was a dead business
years ago.

00:27:20,727 --> 00:27:23,196
Our goal--Carlos and I's goal

00:27:23,196 --> 00:27:25,198
is--is to move this thing
forward.

00:27:25,198 --> 00:27:26,866
We think it has
tremendous potential.

00:27:26,866 --> 00:27:28,201
Scott, never invest

00:27:28,201 --> 00:27:30,603
in a business
that's rolling downhill,

00:27:30,603 --> 00:27:34,874
'cause a boulder rolling
downhill cannot be stopped.

00:27:36,409 --> 00:27:37,677
I'm out.

00:27:37,677 --> 00:27:40,546
Okay. Let--Let--Let me say...

00:27:40,546 --> 00:27:41,881
I'm just trying
to figure out,

00:27:41,881 --> 00:27:43,016
can I make any money
off this thing?

00:27:43,016 --> 00:27:44,350
I don't think so.

00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,285
I think the problems
are really dramatic

00:27:46,285 --> 00:27:48,821
in terms of how you get it
to the market.

00:27:48,821 --> 00:27:51,457
I don't think the beer business
or the pop business

00:27:51,457 --> 00:27:53,726
or any bottler's gonna
add to the cost

00:27:53,726 --> 00:27:55,461
of distributing their product
when They've already got sales.

00:27:55,461 --> 00:27:56,596
They're gonna have
no interest.

00:27:56,596 --> 00:27:58,264
So I gotta sell it
one at a time.

00:27:58,264 --> 00:28:01,200
I have no interest
in joining you in that hell.

00:28:02,735 --> 00:28:03,669
I am out.

00:28:03,669 --> 00:28:05,138
Okay.

00:28:05,138 --> 00:28:06,939
(Daymond)
You're asking for 12% royalty.

00:28:06,939 --> 00:28:10,810
So in this market,
a royalty at 12%--

00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:13,346
I could probably go get
Mickey mouse as a license

00:28:13,346 --> 00:28:14,881
and put it on anything
and sell a large amount of it.

00:28:14,881 --> 00:28:18,351
So for something unknown,
you should be asking for 5%.

00:28:18,351 --> 00:28:20,219
That's just the beginning
of the problems

00:28:20,219 --> 00:28:23,823
of something you haven't proven
in the market. I'm out.

Before we continue

This--This boulder
that's rolling,

00:28:30,263 --> 00:28:33,733
let's get off the royalties.
Really, what we want--

00:28:33,733 --> 00:28:34,867
Well, that's not working so far,
is it?

00:28:34,867 --> 00:28:36,869
Well... Well...

00:28:36,869 --> 00:28:38,004
guys, I'd like to--
I'd like to stop it.

00:28:38,004 --> 00:28:39,338
(mark and Daymond laugh)
Uh...

00:28:39,338 --> 00:28:40,673
hard to stop a boulder.

00:28:40,673 --> 00:28:43,276
I'm--I'm trying. I'm trying.

00:28:43,276 --> 00:28:45,344
The problem is,
I don't like it,

00:28:45,344 --> 00:28:47,480
I don't want it,
I don't need it,

00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,817
and I definitely don't want
to help it.

00:28:50,817 --> 00:28:51,181
So...

00:28:51,181 --> 00:28:54,050
(tears paper)
I'm out.

00:28:57,687 --> 00:28:59,222

Thanks for your time.

(laughs)
(Kevin)
I was just looking at that.

00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,833
I think it's very cool
right now.

00:29:26,494 --> 00:29:28,633
In season 2,
Rebecca Rescate pitched

00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:30,869
her cat toilet training system
citikitty...

00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:33,672
you take the citikitty training
seat that you see there,

00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:34,940
you put it on your toilet,

00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,475
and you fill it with
a small amount of kitty litter.

00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:38,810
And sealed a deal
with Kevin Harrington...

00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,212
20%, $100,000?
Yes.

00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:42,013
Okay.

00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:44,082
Which catapulted her business
to huge success.

00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:45,750
Before "Shark tank,"

00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,019
citikitty had only $100,000
in sales a year,

00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:50,956
and now citikitty is breaking
$1 million this year alone.

00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:54,693
Now she's back to the tank
to try her luck again

00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:57,963
with a partner
and a brand-new product.

00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:03,101
She's so familiar.

00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:03,602
Oh, yeah.

00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,739
Hello, sharks. I'm Chris.

00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:08,607
And I'm Rebecca.

00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:11,009
Our product is Hoodie Pillow.

00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:16,081
We're seeking $90,000
for 15% of our company.

00:30:16,081 --> 00:30:18,683
Sharks, you may remember me
and my product from season 2,

00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:20,752
the citikitty
cat toilet training kit.

00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:22,821
Not only did I walk away
from "Shark Tank" with a deal,

00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,290
but my experience helped me see
the huge potential

00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:28,226
in my newest venture,
Hoodie Pillow.

00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:30,896
Citikitty revolutionized
owning a cat.

00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:33,765
Get ready for Hoodie Pillow
to revolutionize relaxation.

00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:38,803
Americans love hoodies Because
they provide casual comfort

00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:40,138
wherever you go.

00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:40,472
You put your hood on,

00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:42,007
you zip it up,

00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:44,409
and you're in your own
cozy environment.

00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:45,744
We love our hoodies so much,

00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:48,213
we would wear them
every chance we could.

00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:50,348
But at times,
they become impractical.

00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:53,952
When lying down,
they pull at your neck,

00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,755
and when sleeping,
the sweatshirt gets too hot.

00:30:56,755 --> 00:30:59,224
And really, the best part
about them is just the hood.

00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:01,626
Problem solved
with Hoodie Pillow.

00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:04,296
Hoodie Pillow combines
the comfort of your pillow

00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:06,031
with America's favorite
piece of clothing...

00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,033
Oh, you're kidding me.
(Kevin laughs)

00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:08,567
the hoodie.
(Robert laughs)

00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:11,336
The hood is completely attached
to the pillowcase.

00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:14,339
There's no pulling.
There's no discomfort.

00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:15,407
It allows you
to turn your head

00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:19,010
and sink into your comfy spot
with ease.

00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,478
Our design has
adjustable drawstrings

00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:23,014
that block out light
and dampen sound,

00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:25,617
a convenient pocket
for your phone and tv remote,

00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:29,754
or a porthole that keeps
your headphones tangle-free.

00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:33,024
Daymond, why don't you come on
down and give it a try?

00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:35,093
I'll give a shot. You know,
I made some money off of hoods.

00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:37,295
I'm gonna lay down...

00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:38,697
you're gonna lay down
and put the hood on.

00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:40,899
(Kevin)
Stick your head in it.

00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:45,337
(all laughing)

00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:46,871
(Robert) Ohh.

00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:49,274
I-I don't think he can look
more ridiculous.

00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:50,875
(all laugh)

00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:52,277
Or more relaxed.

00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:53,612
Right now for Hoodie Pillow,

00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:57,015
we've already sold
over 3,000 units.

00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:58,683
We launched eight weeks ago.

00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:00,552
All right.

00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:02,754
(Mark) That's your market.

00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,422
(laughter continues)

00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,358
(nasal voice)
Can I get into the club?

00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:09,561
(laughter continues)

00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:11,830
All right.

00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,231
(Kevin) Hey, Rebecca,
you had...

00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:15,233
(Rebecca) You know what?
Let--Let's call it
like it is.

00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:19,604
You had a Winner in
the cat, uh, poo-poo dome thing.

00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:20,405
There was no question
about it.

00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:22,273
Citikitty is doing fantastic.
We're gonna reach

00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,609
about $5 million in sales
this coming year.

00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,211
$5 million?!
Good for you.

00:32:26,211 --> 00:32:27,412
Did you invent this?

00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:29,280
Chris is the inventor
of this product.

00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,815
And as soon as I saw it,

00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:32,217
I knew the huge market potential
for it.

00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:36,221
There was a reason that
the snuggie sold $500 million

00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:37,689
in product.

00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,624
(Kevin) So you just got on board
as an opportunist?

00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,092
I think they call me
a mini shark.

00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:43,962
(chuckles) A mini shark.
I own 30% of the company.

00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,296
How much did you put up?
$15,000.

00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,832
Chris--Christopher, how did you
come up with it?

00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:48,700
I invented Hoodie Pillow

00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,803
After bringing my triplet girls
home from the hospital.

00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,138
Our lives were turned
upside down,

00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:56,141
our sleep schedules were
completely taken away from us,

00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,075
and I needed a way to shut
the world off just a little bit

00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:58,410
and regroup.

00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:59,411
I've known Rebecca
for a few years,

00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:01,813
and she was one of the first
people that it brought it to.

00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,015
And you should've seen
the look on her face.

00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:06,951
So, Rebecca, you have a knack
for crazy-looking stuff.

00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:08,420
Yes.
But you were right last time.

00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,421
I gotta tell you,
when you came out here,

00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:12,023
I thought it was the most
ridiculous thing I'd ever seen,

00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:13,291
and your proved us all wrong.

00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:15,493
I have the same reaction here.
Yeah.

00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,495
Well, you have
to keep in mind,

00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,097
we launched Hoodie Pillow
eight weeks ago--

00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:21,499
A soft launch with one Link
on facebook--

00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:25,003
And we did $60,000
in 8 weeks.

00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,605
I invested in, uh, Chris
and in this product

00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:28,940
'cause I believe in it.
Chris and I--on our, uh--

00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:32,944
but you already have a shark,
one of our beloved sharks,

00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:34,679
who helped you with this
progress--Kevin Harrington--

00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,881
Yep.
Of your citikitty.

00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:38,550
You have money.
You have distribution.

00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:41,219
I came here thinking that
your experience in textiles...
Yeah.

00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:44,689
And then the experience that
Barbara has with consumer--

00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:45,690
(Robert) I know why she's here.
(Rebecca) It's different.

00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:49,961
Because "Shark tank" made
citikitty a $5 million product.

00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:51,896
She's not stupid.

00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:52,230
Maybe, Chris,
you can answer this.

00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,165
One of you are gonna have to.

00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:56,968
You put your money
in a valuation

00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:59,070
of around $50,000
for the business.

00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,873
Then you walk in here
and tell me it's worth $600,000.

00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,609
Rebecca invested in the company
when it was an idea.

00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,277
We launched the product.
We had sales.

00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:07,879
It's proving that people like
this product.

00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,748
They see it and they buy it.

00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:12,283
We posted one link on facebook.
The product went viral.

00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:14,886
Within three weeks, we were
on "Good Morning America,"

00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:18,356
"today" Show, aol, msn,
yahoo's main pages,

00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:21,826
nasdaq "Businessweek."
People see it and they buy it.

00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:23,495
Rebecca, here's where
I was wrong about citikitty.

00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:25,430
It fixed a problem.
Yes.

00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,832
People didn't have to clean
Kitty litter.

00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:30,568
What problem is this solving?
It doesn't matter.

00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,270
There are 30 million students
in colleges

00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,272
that are sitting in dorm rooms
right now

00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:36,207
that are laying within 4 feet
of somebody else

00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:38,076
that love the hoodie Pillow.

00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,411
And all looking to buy--Spend
their money on something stupid.

00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,147
Right?
Yeah. It's only 20 bucks.

00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:43,214
And what does it cost
to make it?

00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:45,216
It costs us $5 to make one.

00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:46,551
Is there a patent on this?

00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:48,620
We have utility
and a design patent on this.

00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:52,891
Nobody can put a Hood
on a pillowcase or a Pillow.

00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:54,359
(laughs) That just sounds
so ridiculous.
(laughs) Yeah.

00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:55,693
But you know what?
I knew, like, with citikitty,

00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:57,228
that I could sell

00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:58,630
maybe $10 million,
$15 million worth of goods.

00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,298
But this product?
This is totally different.

00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:02,634
We're talking
tens of millions of dollars.

00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:04,736
Tens of millions?
Absolutely.

00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:07,071
There are 300 million americans,

00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:08,873
like, that this product
is applicable to.

00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:10,275
It's anybody
with a head that sleeps,

00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,277
and I'm pretty sure
that's every one of you.
(laughter)

00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:14,279
And what are you gonna do
with the $90,000?

00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:15,747
First, we're gonna start
investing in, um,

00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:17,682
low-cost high-yield marketing.

00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:19,217
What low-cost high-yield
marketing?

00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:20,552
Uh, well,
a lot of social marketing

00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:21,886
and stuff like that online,
facebook.

00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:23,755
We posted a video, like,
two or three weeks ago

00:35:23,755 --> 00:35:25,423
that have already had, like,
10,000 views

00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:27,692
and have driven a ton of traffic
to our web site.

00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:29,294
After that, we're gonna start
running a commercial

00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:30,295
that we've already produced
and tested.

00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:33,164
So you're not using any of this
for production

00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:33,832
or anything of that nature?
(mouths word)

00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:35,433
You have production
already locked up?
Yes.

00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:39,003
We do have a new product.

00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:44,609
Hoodie Pillow has
a huge market for it,

00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:46,411
but the more exciting thing is,

00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:49,747
there are 1.5 billion people
that fly on airlines

00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:50,348
every year.
(laughs) Oh, god!

00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:52,016
(Robert laughs)
(Mark) Actually,
that's not bad.

00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:53,551
You know what? That's not bad.

00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:56,421
Could you bundle that together
and sell 'em together?

00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:57,755
(Rebecca) Of course.

00:35:57,755 --> 00:35:59,424
The reason I like that
is it solves a problem.

00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:00,225
Yes.
I don't want to talk
to the person next to me

00:36:00,225 --> 00:36:01,893
on the airplane.

00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:03,895
Tell us--Tell us about
this one.

00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:06,030
Okay, so there are
1.5 billion people

00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,433
that fly on airlines
every single year.

00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:10,468
And most of us are sitting
in a commercial aircraft.

00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:13,404
We don't have
our own 757s or g5s.

00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:17,408
We're flying, sitting within
1, 2 feet of somebody else.

00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:19,344
Hoodie Pillow provides you
comfort by holding up your neck

00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:20,678
when you're trying to relax,

00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,547
and then also provides you
privacy.

00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:24,816
The travel Pillow retails
for $15

00:36:24,816 --> 00:36:26,551
and, uh, the cost is
less than $3 to make it.

00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:28,887
You have pretty good credibility
in this space.

00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:32,891
Even though the stuff may
be crap, you sell a lot of it.

00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:33,358
That's what matters.

00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,360
(chuckles) Well, thank you.

00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,630
So here's an offer for you.
I'll make it very simple.

00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,098
Um, I'll give you the 90k,

00:36:40,098 --> 00:36:42,033
but I'm gonna be
a 1/3, third partner.

00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:42,700
But the only way
I would do this deal

00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,802
is that you don't take
any draw from the business,

00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:46,604
and when you make the draw
you'll decide.

00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:49,674
But each of us pay ourselves
the same amount

00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:50,942
when the draw occurs.
Look at her.
She's already laughing at him.

00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:53,077
Well, maybe she is,
maybe she isn't.

00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:54,746
But right now
you haven't made any offers.

00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:57,215
So when it comes time to
cash out, I wanna wet my beak

00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,217
at the same pace you are.
I'm hearing "Cash out."
That's all I'm hearing.

00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,352
I'm not hearing something

00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:02,820
that's gonna help us grow this
business is what we're...

00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,155
I don't want to help you grow
the business.

00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:05,823
I don't want
to help finance it.

00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:07,492
I just know that you're
very successful at what you do.

00:37:07,492 --> 00:37:08,493
I don't know.
At least be respectful.
You may not get another offer,

00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:11,029
so you should be careful.
Yeah.

00:37:11,029 --> 00:37:12,363
Yes, you're right. Um...

00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:13,698
(laughs)
(Kevin) Yes, I am.
I'm always right.

00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:14,565
Oh, wow.

00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,367
Um... we'll consider it.

00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:18,202
You decide when
the capital comes out.

00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:19,537
But when it comes out,

00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:21,005
each of us get a third,
a third, a third.

00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:24,142
What's wrong with that?

00:37:24,142 --> 00:37:24,676
Nothing.

00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:28,947
Kevin, I would be interested
in working with you.

00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:31,082
I like you a lot.
You're my favorite shark.

00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,017
I would be willing to do...

00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:35,887
25% for $100,000.

00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,755
I wanna be a third,
a third, a third,

00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,224
and I'm happy giving you 90k.
I like my offer.

00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,562
I'd to hear if there are
other offers.

00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:46,831
I mean, I think we're bringing
a lot to the table here.

00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:48,900
We have a product that has
a huge market.

00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:52,136
I'm--I'm just like Kevin.

00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:52,470
I want--I want a third
of the company.

00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,805
I don't care about

00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:55,673
pulling the money out like that
necessarily.

00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:58,076
If you guys are working
every day, I'm fine with that.

00:37:58,076 --> 00:37:59,610
And I wanna take this to my guys
at travelpro,

00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,278
and I wanna take that
to hsn

00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:03,948
and--And help with
the manufacturing.

00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,685
Can you make the decision
and give me in ten seconds?

00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:09,354
Or I'm gonna be out.

00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:17,028
♪♪

00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:25,700
♪♪

00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,835
Can you make the decision
and give me in ten seconds?

00:38:27,835 --> 00:38:28,503
Or I'm gonna be out.

00:38:28,503 --> 00:38:29,904
Before you do that--No--
because I'm very excited,

00:38:29,904 --> 00:38:31,306
and I'm not gonna
let this price go up.

00:38:31,306 --> 00:38:33,041
No, no, I just wanna
jump in with Daymond.

00:38:33,041 --> 00:38:34,042
Daymond--
I'm not gonna
let the price go up.

00:38:34,042 --> 00:38:35,310
So I'm gonna give you
ten seconds, Chris and Rebecca,

00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:36,377
to please accept my offer,

00:38:36,377 --> 00:38:39,380
'cause I'm excited, and I do not
want this price to go up.

00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:42,784
Oh, he's pulling
the ol' Mark Cuban.

00:38:42,784 --> 00:38:43,918
I think the--one of
the amazing things is

00:38:43,918 --> 00:38:45,320
actually hearing what
all of the sharks have to say,

00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,789
and we haven't even gotten
that opportunity yet.

00:38:47,789 --> 00:38:49,991
We haven't heard anything
from Mr. Cuban or...

00:38:49,991 --> 00:38:52,460
okay, the ten seconds is up.
I'm rescinding my offer.

00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,595
I'm out.

00:38:56,464 --> 00:38:57,932
Okay.

00:38:57,932 --> 00:38:58,299
You have an offer
on the table.

00:38:58,299 --> 00:39:00,902
So far, I have not heard
any others.

00:39:00,902 --> 00:39:02,370
The only other was retracted

00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:04,906
'cause Daymond's
in a nasty mood today.

00:39:04,906 --> 00:39:06,975
I'm gonna make an offer.

00:39:06,975 --> 00:39:07,976
Let's hear it.

00:39:07,976 --> 00:39:10,178
I trust you, but I don't trust
the product enough.

00:39:10,178 --> 00:39:14,983
Okay.
So I'll give you half
for 40% of your business.

00:39:14,983 --> 00:39:17,385
But Daymond has got to come
back in with me,

00:39:17,385 --> 00:39:20,655
putting up half of the $90,000
and I the other half.

00:39:20,655 --> 00:39:21,456
He's a great partner for you.

00:39:21,456 --> 00:39:25,460
And I want 10 cents
for every Pillow you sell.

00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,794
Ooh!

00:39:26,794 --> 00:39:27,528
Royalty.
Even worse.

00:39:27,528 --> 00:39:28,863
Call it what you want.

00:39:28,863 --> 00:39:30,665
Let's call it a royalty.
(laughs)

00:39:30,665 --> 00:39:33,501
But you have to admit,
it's a very high-Risk business.

00:39:33,501 --> 00:39:35,169
I don't agree with that.

00:39:35,169 --> 00:39:36,771
We've launched this company
with $10,000

00:39:36,771 --> 00:39:39,574
and were profitable
within the first few weeks.

00:39:39,574 --> 00:39:40,775
And I've done this before--
If Barbara wants that deal,

00:39:40,775 --> 00:39:42,777
I'm willing to entertain
that deal.

00:39:42,777 --> 00:39:44,645
I already have a luggage line
with travelpro.

00:39:44,645 --> 00:39:46,581
I could put this right into
that system and obv--

00:39:46,581 --> 00:39:48,916
So, Daymond, you're willing
to partner with me?

00:39:48,916 --> 00:39:50,385
I'm willing to partner with you,
but we need that answer now

00:39:50,385 --> 00:39:52,987
before this drags out
and the prices go up.

00:39:55,857 --> 00:39:59,394
W-We came in here
and wanting to do a deal.

00:39:59,394 --> 00:40:00,595
I--And, Daymond, of course
we were thinking about you

00:40:00,595 --> 00:40:01,929
'cause of your experience
in the textile industry.

00:40:01,929 --> 00:40:03,131
But for giving up 40%
of the company

00:40:03,131 --> 00:40:04,999
and then you have
two partners here...

00:40:04,999 --> 00:40:06,367
let me make it
more interesting.

00:40:06,367 --> 00:40:08,770
I am willing to put Daymond
in on my deal

00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:10,238
and throw Barbara
under the bus.

00:40:10,238 --> 00:40:11,572
I don't want this
to get too crazy.

00:40:11,572 --> 00:40:13,574
I'm still
with Barbara on it,

00:40:13,574 --> 00:40:15,710
because there wouldn't be
enough meat for Barbara and I

00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:18,513
or Kevin and I to work
at a lower percentage.

00:40:18,513 --> 00:40:21,849
Are you declining the offer
for $90,000?

00:40:21,849 --> 00:40:24,919
Both Barbara and I will
be in for 40%.

00:40:24,919 --> 00:40:27,588
I think that's too high
of a share of the company.

00:40:27,588 --> 00:40:29,924
We've done $60,000 in goods.

00:40:29,924 --> 00:40:32,126
I would do the same deal
if it's--if it's...
don't do it.

00:40:32,126 --> 00:40:33,461
30%.

00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:37,665
(Kevin)
my deal's very simple.

00:40:37,665 --> 00:40:40,034
It's $90,000 for 33 1/3%.

00:40:40,034 --> 00:40:42,036
We're 3-Way partners.

00:40:42,036 --> 00:40:43,171
And we all get paid
at the same time,

00:40:43,171 --> 00:40:45,506
which is very reasonable.

00:40:45,506 --> 00:40:49,911
Daymond's and my deal
is $90,000 cash for 40%,

00:40:49,911 --> 00:40:52,246
and we get 10 cents
on every Pillow that you sell.

00:40:52,246 --> 00:40:55,783
Barbara and Daymond, can you do
that same deal at 30%?

00:40:55,783 --> 00:40:57,852
Don't do it. You guys are crazy
if you do that deal.

00:40:57,852 --> 00:41:02,056
If we went halfway and met you
right in the middle--35%--

00:41:02,056 --> 00:41:04,058
Would you come the other half?

00:41:06,461 --> 00:41:08,529
Rebecca, you obviously have
a number in mind.

00:41:08,529 --> 00:41:10,264
Why are we skating around it?

00:41:10,264 --> 00:41:11,933
What's your number?

00:41:11,933 --> 00:41:12,567
20% for $90,000.

00:41:14,569 --> 00:41:17,171
Okay. So we've heard
from both of you. I'm out.

00:41:18,906 --> 00:41:20,575
Why are you out?

00:41:20,575 --> 00:41:22,310
Because they don't want
to meet us halfway.

00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:25,113
You won't accept the 40%.
You won't accept 35%.

00:41:34,122 --> 00:41:38,326
(Robert) Rebecca, let me make it
very simple.

00:41:38,326 --> 00:41:40,128
I'll give you the $90,000
for 20%.

00:41:42,396 --> 00:41:45,066
I missed out on you once.
Mm-hmm.

00:41:45,066 --> 00:41:46,100
I'm not gonna do it again.

00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,969
I think you're gonna
make it happen.
Wow.

00:41:49,237 --> 00:41:52,573
That's a full-price offer.
Why would you even hesitate?

00:41:52,573 --> 00:41:54,442
I'm looking at
the majority shareholder.

00:41:54,442 --> 00:41:56,978
I have--He has to make
that decision.

00:42:05,853 --> 00:42:08,322
Robert, you have a deal.
Very good.

00:42:08,322 --> 00:42:10,925
Damn.
(Robert) Excellent.

00:42:10,925 --> 00:42:12,927
Thank you.
Yeah, thanks. Nice to be
in business with you this time.

00:42:12,927 --> 00:42:14,662
Thank you. Thanks, you guys.
Whoo! Thanks!

00:42:14,662 --> 00:42:15,263
Very Good. Thank you.
Good luck to you.

00:42:15,263 --> 00:42:17,064
(Robert) Well...

00:42:17,064 --> 00:42:18,566
you sneaky guy, you.

00:42:18,566 --> 00:42:20,168
(laughs)
I'll tell you something.

00:42:20,168 --> 00:42:22,103
That lady--She's gonna
make it happen.

00:42:22,103 --> 00:42:25,907
I don't like her.
I don't care if you like her.

00:42:25,907 --> 00:42:27,575
You like her when
she's on your side.

00:42:27,575 --> 00:42:30,244
I feel so excited to come back
in "Shark tank" Again

00:42:30,244 --> 00:42:31,846
and walk away
with another deal.

00:42:31,846 --> 00:42:34,649
And Robert is gonna be
a great partner for us.
