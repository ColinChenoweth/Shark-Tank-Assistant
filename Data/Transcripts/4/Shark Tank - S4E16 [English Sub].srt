00:00:00,467 --> 00:00:01,869
The sharks are back

00:00:01,869 --> 00:00:03,737
in an all-new season
of "Shark Tank,"

00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:07,567
where hopeful entrepreneurs
from across the country

00:00:07,567 --> 00:00:10,200
dream of a chance
to secure an investment

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,801
and gain powerful partners

00:00:11,801 --> 00:00:15,433
to start, grow, or save
their businesses.

00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:17,302
I decided to revolutionize
the dessert industry.

00:00:17,302 --> 00:00:20,038
(all) We can save lives,
and you can make money.

00:00:20,038 --> 00:00:22,040
If the sharks hear
a great idea,

00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,109
they're ready to invest
using their own money...

00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:26,845
I'll give you $1 million.

00:00:26,845 --> 00:00:29,647
And they'll fight each other
for a piece of the action.

00:00:29,647 --> 00:00:31,116
Listen to what he just said!

00:00:31,116 --> 00:00:31,450
(Robert)
Kevin, why would they--

00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:32,650
It doesn't matter
what you think.

00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,384
I couldn't care less.
It's what they think.

00:00:34,384 --> 00:00:37,187
But first the entrepreneurs
must convince a shark

00:00:37,187 --> 00:00:40,190
to invest the full amount
they're asking for

00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,192
or they'll walk away
with nothing.

00:00:42,192 --> 00:00:43,994
How can you come in here
and say,

00:00:43,994 --> 00:00:45,395
"I need to get clear
on the numbers"?

00:00:45,395 --> 00:00:46,730
I thought I had a good,
basic understanding of it.

00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,665
No, you were terrible.
It's sink...

00:00:48,665 --> 00:00:51,335
all I see is problems.
Or swim.

00:00:51,335 --> 00:00:52,669
We have an order from

00:00:52,669 --> 00:00:54,004
a very high-ranking
government official.

00:00:54,004 --> 00:00:55,472
How about president Obama?
Wow.

00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,740
â™ªâ™ª

00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,943
Who are the sharks?

00:00:59,943 --> 00:01:03,680
They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,282
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.

00:01:07,117 --> 00:01:09,453
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist

00:01:09,453 --> 00:01:13,256
who turned a $10,000 loan
into a software business

00:01:13,256 --> 00:01:17,794
worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:17,794 --> 00:01:19,796
Barbara Corcoran
went from working

00:01:19,796 --> 00:01:20,731
as a waitress in Manhattan

00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:24,201
to building the city's
preeminent real estate empire.

00:01:24,201 --> 00:01:27,404
Daymond John is a fashion mogul
and branding expert

00:01:27,404 --> 00:01:30,674
who grew
his homemade clothing line

00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:33,610
into the globally recognized
fashion brand Fubu.

00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,546
Robert Herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,

00:01:36,546 --> 00:01:38,615
is now a technology mogul

00:01:38,615 --> 00:01:40,450
who sold his first
internet companies

00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:44,454
for over $350 million.

00:01:44,454 --> 00:01:46,256
And Mark Cuban,

00:01:46,256 --> 00:01:48,325
notorious
billionaire entrepreneur

00:01:48,325 --> 00:01:51,061
and the outspoken owner
of the Dallas Mavericks.

00:02:00,404 --> 00:02:04,133
â™ªâ™ª

00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:05,468
First up is Carmen Lindner,

00:02:05,468 --> 00:02:10,339
selling a delicious new twist
on an old camping favorite.

00:02:17,046 --> 00:02:20,182
Hi.
My name is Carmen Lindner,

00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,985
and I am the founder and c.E.O.
Of gotta have s'more.

00:02:22,985 --> 00:02:25,788
I'm here seeking an investment
of $75,000

00:02:25,788 --> 00:02:29,258
in exchange for 25% equity
in my company.

00:02:29,258 --> 00:02:31,060
Quick show of hands here.

00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,128
Who likes s'mores?

00:02:32,128 --> 00:02:33,729
Me, too.

00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:35,731
But you know what I don't like?

00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:37,400
Camping.

00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,202
(sharks laugh)
So I decided to set out

00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:41,804
and revolutionize
the dessert industry.

00:02:41,804 --> 00:02:45,408
I want to introduce you
to the s'muffin.

00:02:45,408 --> 00:02:48,511
The s'muffin is a s'more
in the shape of a mini muffin.

00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:52,515
And I promise you have never
seen or tasted

00:02:52,515 --> 00:02:53,582
anything
quite like this before.

00:02:53,582 --> 00:02:54,984
You don't have to take
my word for it,

00:02:54,984 --> 00:02:57,920
'cause you get to try some
right now.

00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,388
Barbara, I want you
to remember something.

00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,324
A moment on the lips,
a lifetime on the hips.

00:03:01,324 --> 00:03:02,925
(Carmen) Oh.
(laughs)

00:03:02,925 --> 00:03:03,726
Thank you.

00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:05,528
You're welcome.

00:03:05,528 --> 00:03:06,862
They sure look yummy, huh?

00:03:06,862 --> 00:03:08,197
They are yummy.
Mmm.

00:03:08,197 --> 00:03:09,932
So the middle one
is dark chocolate.

00:03:09,932 --> 00:03:13,002
There's one that's chocolate
with caramel.

00:03:13,002 --> 00:03:14,937
And another half that is...

00:03:14,937 --> 00:03:16,272
thank you.

00:03:16,272 --> 00:03:17,606
(Carmen) Milk chocolate.

00:03:17,606 --> 00:03:19,475
Oh, that's a good one.

00:03:19,475 --> 00:03:20,943
(Kevin) Carmen, it's gotta be
a million calories.

00:03:20,943 --> 00:03:22,712
It's not
a million calories.

00:03:22,712 --> 00:03:23,713
It's only 200 calories,

00:03:23,713 --> 00:03:27,450
but I'm not trying
to market these as a fat-free.

00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,985
And so now that you've tried
your very first s'muffin,

00:03:29,985 --> 00:03:33,255
you know why my customers
are constantly coming back,

00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:37,460
saying, "Carmen,
I gotta have s'more."

00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,277
(Robert chuckles)

00:03:38,277 --> 00:03:40,043
Okay, Carmen, what--
what are your sales?

00:03:40,043 --> 00:03:43,780
My sales to date,
for two and a half year,

00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,915
are $250,000.

00:03:44,915 --> 00:03:47,050
And that's just within
local mark--L.A. market.

00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,586
What do you think
you're gonna do this year?

00:03:49,586 --> 00:03:53,457
This year, my forecast
is to do $165,000.

00:03:53,457 --> 00:03:54,758
How do you sell them,
Carmen?

00:03:54,758 --> 00:03:58,629
75% of my customers
come direct to me online

00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:00,631
or they phone in.

00:04:00,631 --> 00:04:01,965
That's been my primary focus
over the first two years.

00:04:01,965 --> 00:04:04,768
Do any stores
carry them as well?

00:04:04,768 --> 00:04:06,370
So there are a few stores
that carry 'em--

00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,239
Local specialty bakeries,
wine stores.

00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:09,973
(Mark)
How much do you sell it for

00:04:09,973 --> 00:04:11,375
and what does it
cost you to make?

00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,176
Costs me to make--

00:04:13,176 --> 00:04:14,845
$9.34 a dozen.

00:04:14,845 --> 00:04:17,648
I charge $29.95 a dozen.

00:04:17,648 --> 00:04:20,050
We deliver
throughout Los Angeles.

00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,719
And just recently, I was able to
launch the national shipping.

00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:25,122
These are the boxes
that I ship 'em in.

00:04:25,122 --> 00:04:26,423
So--
(Barbara)
You ship them frozen?

00:04:26,423 --> 00:04:28,158
Ship them frozen.

00:04:28,158 --> 00:04:29,426
5 pounds of dry ice
with a cooler.

00:04:29,426 --> 00:04:30,761
How much
is that cost for shipping?

00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:33,363
Shipping cost alone
is $54.

00:04:33,363 --> 00:04:34,698
Whoa.
That's a lot.

00:04:34,698 --> 00:04:36,299
Which is high, but...

00:04:36,299 --> 00:04:39,369
stop the madness, Carmen.
Let's walk through this.

00:04:39,369 --> 00:04:42,773
You've got a dozen little
shmuffins or shmores in there.

00:04:42,773 --> 00:04:45,442
And I have to pay 60 bucks
to get them...

00:04:45,442 --> 00:04:47,310
(laughs)
To my honey bunny in New York.

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,645
All right?
Mm-hmm.

00:04:48,645 --> 00:04:50,113
That is, like, 10 bucks
a shmore.

00:04:50,113 --> 00:04:52,115
That's right in line
with all my comp--

00:04:52,115 --> 00:04:53,650
All my competitors.

00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,986
Is there anything else
out in the market

00:04:55,986 --> 00:04:57,320
comparable to this?

00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,390
No. This is my baby.

00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,758
I trademarked
the name "S'muffin."

00:05:01,758 --> 00:05:03,760
I didn't want to just
call it a s'more

00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,229
because honestly, it's so much
more than a s'more.

00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:08,765
It's a shmuffin.

00:05:08,765 --> 00:05:09,833
It's a s'muffin.
I get it,

00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,368
but the cost
is freaking me out.

00:05:11,368 --> 00:05:14,200
I'm just thinking--
What--what do you think
is expensive?

00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,935
It's 10 bucks a shmuffer.

00:05:15,935 --> 00:05:16,869
(Daymond laughs)

00:05:16,869 --> 00:05:19,272
My target market--
They're high-end customers.

00:05:19,272 --> 00:05:21,540
They're used to paying
shipping...
(Robert) But why argue
with you, Carmen?

00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,875
And I'm getting--
You're doing it today. You're
selling them at that price.

00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,277
Yeah, and--
Not that many.

00:05:24,277 --> 00:05:25,544
You haven't sold many shmuffers
at that price.

00:05:25,544 --> 00:05:27,667
She sells $165,000 a year.

00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:29,536
Are you selling
a lot of product

00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:31,538
that costs $60 a box?

00:05:31,538 --> 00:05:32,472
Come on.
Yes.

00:05:32,472 --> 00:05:34,574
That's crazy.
$50--

00:05:34,574 --> 00:05:36,776
Am I the only person
Who says that's insane?

00:05:36,776 --> 00:05:38,245
(laughs)

00:05:38,245 --> 00:05:39,579
I mean, you fedex this
across the country...

00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:41,581
you wouldn't bel--
Or you send your children
to college.

00:05:41,581 --> 00:05:42,916
(Mark and Daymond laugh)
You choose one.

00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,918
You wouldn't--
Like, think about that.

00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:45,719
You wouldn't believe

00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:47,787
the frenzy
that these things create.

00:05:47,787 --> 00:05:51,858
This is
the next dessert craze.

00:05:51,858 --> 00:05:53,393
All right, Carmen. I'm not
gonna invest in your shmagels.

00:05:53,393 --> 00:05:56,329
I'm out.

00:05:56,329 --> 00:05:58,865
(laughs) Sorry, Carmen.

00:05:58,865 --> 00:06:00,400
What's your background?

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,536
I was an advertising
sales executive.

00:06:03,536 --> 00:06:05,538
I was laid off
during the recession.

00:06:05,538 --> 00:06:06,206
I got a severance package.

00:06:06,206 --> 00:06:09,042
My husband and I
had always dreamed

00:06:09,042 --> 00:06:12,646
of starting a s'more store,
and--

00:06:12,646 --> 00:06:13,647
What?

00:06:13,647 --> 00:06:15,048
I-I never met somebody Who
loves s'mores more than you.

00:06:15,048 --> 00:06:17,183
(laughs)
When you say "s'more,"

00:06:17,183 --> 00:06:18,451
it brings back
happy memories,

00:06:18,451 --> 00:06:20,387
and people
automatically smile.

00:06:20,387 --> 00:06:23,123
I see this all the time
at events.

00:06:23,123 --> 00:06:24,791
They're like, "Oh, my gosh.
These are unique.

00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:25,592
What is this, a cupcake?"

00:06:25,592 --> 00:06:27,327
I'm like, "Oh, no.
It's better than a cupcake.

00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,862
It's a s'muffin."

00:06:28,862 --> 00:06:31,464
And then they taste it,
and then just fall over.

00:06:31,464 --> 00:06:34,868
Then they order it
and go bankrupt.
(Daymond laughing)

00:06:34,868 --> 00:06:35,268
They come back.

00:06:35,268 --> 00:06:37,604
They come back
and they order over and over.

00:06:37,604 --> 00:06:41,274
My biggest cost
was investing

00:06:41,274 --> 00:06:44,311
in getting
the national shipping down.

00:06:44,311 --> 00:06:45,979
Why didn't you just
stay local then?
Yeah, like why are you--

00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:47,314
if it was gonna cost you
all your money--

00:06:47,314 --> 00:06:48,648
'cause I don't want
to stay local.

00:06:48,648 --> 00:06:50,450
I want everybody to be able
to have these.

00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,718
I want s'muffins
and gotta have s'mores...

00:06:51,718 --> 00:06:53,386
that's completely
different, though, than--
to be a national name.

00:06:53,386 --> 00:06:55,722
That's a whole different thing
than trying to make money.

00:06:55,722 --> 00:06:57,857
You have a huge market
in Los Angeles.

00:06:57,857 --> 00:06:58,191
Mm-hmm.

00:06:58,191 --> 00:06:59,659
And you've got
willing customers.

00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:01,795
Why focus on
trying to solve a problem

00:07:01,795 --> 00:07:02,529
that's not really
a problem?

00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:04,931
This was one focus.
(chuckles)

00:07:04,931 --> 00:07:06,800
I'm also now wanting
to start focusing

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,400
on wholesaling as well.
(laughs)

00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,004
Carmen, you're so in love
with your s'muffins,

00:07:11,004 --> 00:07:13,606
you can't see the dollars
from the marshmallows.

00:07:13,606 --> 00:07:15,575
I'm out.

00:07:15,575 --> 00:07:17,310
(Robert) Carmen,

00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,446
you put yourself in a position

00:07:19,446 --> 00:07:21,781
where you have to ask for
$75,000 from us

00:07:21,781 --> 00:07:26,720
and give up 25% equity
to fix a problem

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,788
that isn't generating
any sales.

00:07:28,788 --> 00:07:31,057
All I see is problems.

00:07:31,057 --> 00:07:34,861
I see it as building
my distribution.

00:07:34,861 --> 00:07:36,196
The s'muffins were good.
I'm out.

00:07:38,198 --> 00:07:41,668
Your strategy is, uh,
s'muffin crazy.

00:07:41,668 --> 00:07:44,738
So, um, I'm out.

00:07:44,738 --> 00:07:48,108
I like nothing more
than a real s'more.

00:07:48,108 --> 00:07:50,777
But when I tasted this,

00:07:50,777 --> 00:07:52,245
it didn't taste anything
really like it.

00:07:52,245 --> 00:07:55,849
So I'm going out just because
I don't like the muffin.

00:07:55,849 --> 00:07:58,385
And I feel badly
telling you that.

00:07:58,385 --> 00:07:59,986
Okay.
Okay?

00:07:59,986 --> 00:08:01,921
But good luck to you.

00:08:01,921 --> 00:08:03,390
Thank you.

00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,525
(Carmen) It was just weird

00:08:05,525 --> 00:08:09,195
that they didn't
go bananas over them.

00:08:09,195 --> 00:08:12,132
It's almost like I was
in the twilight zone... (laughs)

00:08:12,132 --> 00:08:16,336
Because that was--That's not
the typical reaction.

00:08:16,336 --> 00:08:19,472
How can there only be
a dozen of them in that box?

00:08:19,472 --> 00:08:20,740
'cause it's full of ice.

00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,643
You're shipping water
across the country.
(sharks laugh)

00:08:27,847 --> 00:08:31,184
in season 3, Donny Mccall
failed to get a deal

00:08:31,184 --> 00:08:33,453
with the sharks
for his folding cargo system,

00:08:33,453 --> 00:08:34,387
invis-a-rack.

00:08:34,387 --> 00:08:36,856
I'm committed to making
invis-a-rack

00:08:36,856 --> 00:08:37,190
in the United States.

00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,392
(Kevin) Donny.
Yes, sir.

00:08:39,392 --> 00:08:40,927
You can't solve the problem
we're talking about here.

00:08:40,927 --> 00:08:42,929
I believe I can make it.
I know I can.

00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:45,331
Let's see
what he's up to now.

00:08:45,331 --> 00:08:48,735
â™ªâ™ª

00:08:48,735 --> 00:08:51,071
Things have been going great
since being on "Shark Tank."

00:08:51,071 --> 00:08:53,606
Before "Shark Tank," I sold
$75,000 worth of product,

00:08:53,606 --> 00:08:55,575
but it took
about a year and a half.

00:08:55,575 --> 00:08:56,643
Since being on "Shark Tank,"

00:08:56,643 --> 00:08:59,646
in about 3 months, I sold
$75,000 worth of product.

00:08:59,646 --> 00:09:01,915
Coulda sold a lot more,
but I actually ran out.

00:09:01,915 --> 00:09:03,583
Hey, Donny.
Welcome to Dee zee.

00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,984
I've solved that problem

00:09:04,984 --> 00:09:05,985
by signing a licensing deal
with a company

00:09:05,985 --> 00:09:07,987
in Des Moines, Iowa,
called Dee Zee.

00:09:07,987 --> 00:09:09,656
And we're gonna be marketing,

00:09:09,656 --> 00:09:11,391
manufacturing,
and distributing invis-a-rack.

00:09:11,391 --> 00:09:13,660
(whirs, clicks)

00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,196
here we have some inventory.
Hey, this is awesome.

00:09:16,196 --> 00:09:18,531
I currently have hundreds
of people on a waiting list,

00:09:18,531 --> 00:09:20,867
and as soon as Dee Zee gets
production ramped up,

00:09:20,867 --> 00:09:22,202
I believe
the sky's the limit.

00:09:22,202 --> 00:09:23,870
Well, Donny, that's
the first one off the line.

00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,405
What do you think?
Looks great.

00:09:25,405 --> 00:09:28,141
Even though I didn't get
a deal on "Shark tank,"

00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:29,642
it's pretty overwhelming to see

00:09:29,642 --> 00:09:30,777
the product that I invented
in my garage

00:09:30,777 --> 00:09:33,379
now in a manufacturing facility
being produced

00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:37,784
by lots of American workers.
It's--It's exciting.

00:09:37,784 --> 00:09:39,519
â™ªâ™ª

00:09:44,057 --> 00:09:47,333
â™ªâ™ª

00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,600
I'm Yuen.
And I'm Peter.

00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,668
We're brothers
from Austin, Texas.

00:09:49,668 --> 00:09:51,937
And we started the sushi
revolution, how do you roll?

00:09:51,937 --> 00:09:53,271
Great combination.

00:09:53,271 --> 00:09:55,073
You got it.
Coming right up.

00:09:55,073 --> 00:09:56,341
I'm the C.E.O.
Of the company.

00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:58,009
I deal with
all the business stuff.

00:09:58,009 --> 00:09:59,678
And I'm the C.O.O.
I'm on the creative side.

00:09:59,678 --> 00:10:00,979
And I came up
with the menu.

00:10:00,979 --> 00:10:03,115
Everything good? Yes?

00:10:03,115 --> 00:10:05,517
Well, we both grew up
in the restaurant business.

00:10:05,517 --> 00:10:07,119
Our parents had several
Chinese restaurants.

00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:08,186
So at the tender age
of 8 and 9,

00:10:08,186 --> 00:10:10,522
we both started working
in our parents' shop.

00:10:10,522 --> 00:10:11,656
The restaurant business
is in our blood.

00:10:11,656 --> 00:10:13,725
It's in our veins.

00:10:13,725 --> 00:10:15,193
It's just what we know.

00:10:15,193 --> 00:10:16,528
What can I get for you,
sir?

00:10:16,528 --> 00:10:16,862
I'd love to have
that slammin' Salmon.

00:10:16,862 --> 00:10:18,263
Slammin' Salmon?
You got it.

00:10:18,263 --> 00:10:19,664
Together, we've created
a sushi experience

00:10:19,664 --> 00:10:22,000
that's never
been done before.

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,468
Can you add cucumber
to that?

00:10:23,468 --> 00:10:25,470
The artichoke.
Can I get that with crab?

00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,539
We've allowed the customer
to become the chef.

00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:29,341
So our customers
get to choose everything--

00:10:29,341 --> 00:10:30,876
From the type of wrap
they want to use

00:10:30,876 --> 00:10:32,010
to the rice
they want to use,

00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,379
the veggies, the proteins,
the sauces, the toppings.

00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:37,048
And nobody is doing
what we're doing today.

00:10:37,048 --> 00:10:38,717
Getting an investment
from the sharks is critical

00:10:38,717 --> 00:10:41,253
at this stage
of where we are as a company.

00:10:41,253 --> 00:10:42,654
I believe our business model
is gonna be the next great thing

00:10:42,654 --> 00:10:45,390
in ethnic food.

00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,057
And with
the sharks' investments,

00:10:46,057 --> 00:10:49,795
we're gonna be able
to explode this concept.

00:10:49,795 --> 00:10:52,798
â™ªâ™ª

00:11:06,478 --> 00:11:07,412
Hello, sharks.

00:11:07,412 --> 00:11:09,700
My name is Yuen Yung.

00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,236
And I'm his younger brother
Peter Yung.

00:11:12,236 --> 00:11:13,905
Our business is
how do you roll?

00:11:13,905 --> 00:11:16,774
We are seeking $1 million

00:11:16,774 --> 00:11:18,442
for 12% of our company.

00:11:18,442 --> 00:11:20,978
How do you roll? Is
a fast-Casual restaurant

00:11:20,978 --> 00:11:22,780
where you can get sushi rolls
made to order,

00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,782
just the way you like it.

00:11:24,782 --> 00:11:26,450
Before we
came onto the scene,

00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,118
if you wanted sushi,

00:11:27,118 --> 00:11:29,187
you really
only had two choices.

00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:31,255
Option number one
was to go to

00:11:31,255 --> 00:11:33,124
a fancy, sit-Down
sushi restaurant

00:11:33,124 --> 00:11:35,193
where you had to dress right,

00:11:35,193 --> 00:11:37,061
you had to smell right,

00:11:37,061 --> 00:11:38,062
you gotta like techno music.
(laughing)

00:11:38,062 --> 00:11:40,264
And, you know,
those can be fun occasionally,

00:11:40,264 --> 00:11:41,199
if you want to spend more money
than you actually have

00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:43,367
trying to impress people
you really don't like.

00:11:43,367 --> 00:11:45,236
(chuckles)
So that leaves you
with your second option.

00:11:45,236 --> 00:11:46,971
You go down to
the local grocery store,

00:11:46,971 --> 00:11:50,041
you get a premade roll
made fresh "daily."

00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,844
You just don't know which day of
the week it was actually made.

00:11:52,844 --> 00:11:54,312
The quality is just subpar.

00:11:54,312 --> 00:11:57,048
And because of
Yuen's horrible experience,

00:11:57,048 --> 00:11:59,450
we started the sushi revolution
three years ago

00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,852
with just one location
in Austin, Texas.

00:12:00,852 --> 00:12:03,521
We've taken
the same food quality

00:12:03,521 --> 00:12:04,188
you get
at a high-end restaurant

00:12:04,188 --> 00:12:04,700
and paired it up

00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,902
with the convenience
of the grocery store.

00:12:06,902 --> 00:12:09,038
Unpretentious, good food
in a fast-casual environment.

00:12:09,038 --> 00:12:11,774
(Yuen) So we want you to
experience this for yourself.

00:12:11,774 --> 00:12:13,442
So, Barbara, we would like
to actually invite you up...

00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:14,777
how nice is this?

00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:16,545
So you can create
your own sushi roll.

00:12:16,545 --> 00:12:17,413
All right, Barbara, whenever
you go to how do you roll?

00:12:17,413 --> 00:12:19,481
Uh, the first thing
you want to do...

00:12:19,481 --> 00:12:19,882
Mm-hmm.
Is pick out
what kind of wrap you'd like.

00:12:19,882 --> 00:12:21,550
We have seaweed wrap,
and we have soy wrap.

00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,885
I'll take the soy wrap.

00:12:22,885 --> 00:12:23,819
Soy wrap. Good choice.

00:12:23,819 --> 00:12:25,821
And what you get to do
is pick out your protein.
Mm-hmm.

00:12:25,821 --> 00:12:28,023
We have crab stick,
chicken, salmon, tuna.

00:12:28,023 --> 00:12:29,691
I'll take the tuna.

00:12:29,691 --> 00:12:31,627
Okay, and we also have
proprietary sauces.
Wow.

00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:32,628
Okay, do you like
spicy, sweet?

00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:34,830
A little spicy.
A little spicy.

00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:35,964
Our best seller
is the spicy mayo.

00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:37,833
I'll take it.
And I'll go ahead
and put that on there.

00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,168
(Peter) You can have a seat,

00:12:39,168 --> 00:12:39,835
and I'll bring that
right out to you.

00:12:39,835 --> 00:12:41,904
Sharks, do not fear,
we have food for you, too.

00:12:41,904 --> 00:12:44,306
You're gonna get to sample
our other side of the menu,

00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:44,907
which is our featured rolls.

00:12:44,907 --> 00:12:46,241
He's making it right there.

00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:47,776
He's making it
right now.

00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:51,013
Thank you, Yuen.

00:12:51,013 --> 00:12:53,348
You bet.

00:12:53,348 --> 00:12:54,149
Daymond.

00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,484
Thank you.
Enjoy.

00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:57,419
Mmm.

00:12:57,419 --> 00:12:58,353
Thank you, sir.
There you go.

00:12:58,353 --> 00:12:59,621
Good sushi.
(mouth full) Fantastic.

00:12:59,621 --> 00:13:00,956
(Yuen) Thank you.
Thank you.

00:13:00,956 --> 00:13:02,291
Hurry. Hurry.

00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,625
Barbara, this is
your custom roll.

00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:04,426
There you go.
How nice is this?

00:13:04,426 --> 00:13:06,028
Yeah.
Mmm.

00:13:07,362 --> 00:13:09,164
(Daymond) Very good.
This is very good.

00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:11,300
So here's our question--

00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,569
Who wants to roll
with us?

00:13:13,569 --> 00:13:14,103
Yuen, how did you
get started in this?

00:13:14,103 --> 00:13:15,571
You know, it's funny.

00:13:15,571 --> 00:13:16,905
We both grew up
in the restaurant business.

00:13:16,905 --> 00:13:18,774
I actually said,

00:13:18,774 --> 00:13:19,108
"I'm never gonna be in
the restaurant business again.

00:13:19,108 --> 00:13:21,043
I'm never gonna work
with family,"

00:13:21,043 --> 00:13:21,944
'cause I had to work with
my parents growing up. (laughs)

00:13:21,944 --> 00:13:24,480
Uh, 14 years later,

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,814
uh, here I am, standing
next to my brother.

00:13:25,814 --> 00:13:29,485
Tell us about the economics
of the business.
Absolutely.

00:13:29,485 --> 00:13:31,687
Uh, so we started franchising
two and a half years ago.

00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:33,021
We have sold 40 total.

00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,890
We've gotten
15 of them opened,

00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,225
two of them
are corporate stores.

00:13:36,225 --> 00:13:37,426
So the first two stores
are our own.

00:13:37,426 --> 00:13:39,094
We opened the first two.

00:13:39,094 --> 00:13:41,630
Since then, we've been
focusing on franchising.

00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,699
Got it.
And the franchisees--

00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:44,967
How long has
the longest one been open?

00:13:44,967 --> 00:13:48,237
Uh, one has been open
for right at about a year.

00:13:48,237 --> 00:13:49,438
And how are they doing?

00:13:49,438 --> 00:13:50,906
What are the economics
of their business?

00:13:50,906 --> 00:13:51,974
So far, so good.
Knock on wood.

00:13:51,974 --> 00:13:53,642
Are they profitable?
They are.

00:13:53,642 --> 00:13:56,879
What's the average bill
in the sit-Down restaurant?

00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:59,148
Roughly, it's around
$10 to $12.

00:13:59,148 --> 00:14:01,283
Sushi's good.
Let's talk money.
Yeah.

00:14:01,283 --> 00:14:03,285
You're offering me 12%
of the corporate entity...

00:14:03,285 --> 00:14:04,620
correct.

00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,621
That owns
all the franchise flows

00:14:05,621 --> 00:14:07,623
for $1 million.

00:14:07,623 --> 00:14:09,291
That is correct.

00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,759
So what is this year's
cash flow gonna look like?

00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:14,096
Just on royalties,
it's $250,000 a year.

00:14:14,096 --> 00:14:14,897
Wow.

00:14:17,432 --> 00:14:19,434
What are your sales
in the corporate stores?

00:14:19,434 --> 00:14:21,170
Oh, uh, one is running
600-something-thousand,

00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:24,039
and the other one
is running $400,000.

00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:24,907
(Barbara)
I would like to ask,

00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:27,309
I'm going to buy a franchise.

00:14:27,309 --> 00:14:29,278
Tell me
what I have to pay you.

00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:31,613
Okay. So the all-in cost
of the franchise,

00:14:31,613 --> 00:14:33,348
including the $20,000
in franchise fee,

00:14:33,348 --> 00:14:36,018
the building out of the store,
buying the equipment--

00:14:36,018 --> 00:14:39,154
$270,000, $300,000 all in.
Mm-hmm.

00:14:39,154 --> 00:14:40,489
(Daymond) So it looks like--
now they're in business.

00:14:40,489 --> 00:14:42,224
Yes.
But what happens after that?

00:14:42,224 --> 00:14:43,358
You get a percentage
of what they sell?

00:14:43,358 --> 00:14:44,760
That is correct.
A royalty.

00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,427
What's your royalty rate?

00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:46,762
Our royalty rate is 7%.

00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:48,363
What are the compliance systems
you have

00:14:48,363 --> 00:14:49,898
to make sure
you're getting paid?

00:14:49,898 --> 00:14:51,233
Uh, we suck it right out
of their checking account

00:14:51,233 --> 00:14:52,634
every week.

00:14:52,634 --> 00:14:53,569
(laughs)
So you mean, in other words,

00:14:53,569 --> 00:14:55,237
they have to set up
a corporate account...
that is correct.

00:14:55,237 --> 00:14:56,972
(Mark) Guys,
let me jump first.

00:14:56,972 --> 00:14:59,575
I-I like the idea.
I like the concept.

00:14:59,575 --> 00:15:02,144
But that's
a brutally competitive area.

00:15:02,144 --> 00:15:04,813
I don't want to be
in the sushi business,

00:15:04,813 --> 00:15:07,216
so I'm out.

00:15:11,086 --> 00:15:13,488
(Kevin) I-I'm looking at it
from a different perspective.

00:15:13,488 --> 00:15:15,157
I believe
it's very well managed.

00:15:15,157 --> 00:15:15,824
I think
your presentation's excellent.

00:15:15,824 --> 00:15:17,492
And you have
the right combination--

00:15:17,492 --> 00:15:19,228
The chef guy
with the finance guy.

00:15:19,228 --> 00:15:22,231
That's perfect.
The valuation is rich.

00:15:22,231 --> 00:15:23,232
It--It is probably
a little bit high.

00:15:23,232 --> 00:15:26,435
We--we have had a, uh,
letter of intent sent to us

00:15:26,435 --> 00:15:29,037
to, uh, buy 75%
of the company.

00:15:29,037 --> 00:15:30,639
And, uh, that valuation

00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,641
came in at 6.6.
Ah.

00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:34,533
Are you going
to do that deal?

00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:35,834
Uh, I-I don't think so.

00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:37,169
I don't think you should.

00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:38,837
Yeah, the reason why is,
because number one,

00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,973
I don't want to lose
that much of the company.

00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:42,975
Uh, really, honestly,
with the opening

00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,176
of, uh, four or five
more stores,

00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:46,645
our royalties will--will--
Will get us to--

00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:48,781
to profitability.
What's your geography right now?
Are they all in Texas?

00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:52,184
No. They are in, uh,
California, Marina Del Rey,

00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:53,519
uh, we have one
in Phoenix, Arizona,

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,454
Tucson, Arizona.

00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,989
Yuen, I got--I gotta tell you,
man, you--You started a business

00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:57,656
a few years ago,

00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:01,927
and someone's offering you
$6.6 million in cash...

00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,529
Mm-hmm.
You'd be
a multimillionaire overnight,

00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,931
and you're just talking about
turning it down like that.

00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:06,598
We are.
Power to you,
'cause I gotta tell you,

00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:08,934
the first time somebody
offered me a million bucks...

00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:10,235
Yeah.

00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:11,570
I--it took me weeks
to say no.

00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,372
I understand.
I wanted to grab that check...

00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,307
right.
And run.

00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:15,908
(Yuen and Barbara laugh)

00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:18,644
(Daymond) So, guys, the profit
that you make in food

00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,246
is in appetizers,

00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,649
liquor and/or beverages,
and desserts.

00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,917
There's no money in this,

00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,986
and you're selling fish--
Fresh fish.

00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,654
I think that the margins
are gonna be too low.

00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,589
I'm out.

00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,324
Okay.

00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,394
Great presentation.

00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,329
Uh, more importantly,
great food.

00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,531
Um...

00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:40,799
I can't help you
with the operation.

00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:45,104
I don't understand
this particular food model.

00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,706
You're running
a great, great business.

00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,842
Thank you.

00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:50,509
I'll bring all my buddies,
we'll spend a lot of money...

00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,378
okay. Thank you.

00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:55,647
But we're not gonna spend
$1 million to invest today.

00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,850
I'm out.

00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,253
You have 15 locations
in 2 1/2 years.

00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:03,188
That is correct.
Amazing.

00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:03,522
Thank you.

00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,791
I have recently gotten involved

00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,126
in two different
food franchises,

00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:10,062
and I'm quickly learning
how complicated it is.

00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:11,397
It can be.

00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,332
So I have great respect
for where you came from

00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:13,932
and how far you got.

00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,601
Thank you.
But I mistrust it.

00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:16,902
I think your presentation
is so buttoned up...

00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:18,570
uh-huh.

00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,440
And for my liking,
a little too buttoned up.

00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,576
So I'm gonna trust my gut
on this. I'm out.

00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,578
Okay.

00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:27,646
Um...

00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,581
I like your business.
I like you guys.

00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:30,916
Thank you.

00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,585
So I'll make you
an offer.

00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:36,121
I'll give you $1 million.

00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:37,656
(Daymond) Whoa.

00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,124
Wow.

00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:42,394
But I want 22%
of the business.

00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,200
And there's one caveat.

00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,438
â™ªâ™ª

00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:57,743
Four sharks are out,

00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,412
and Peter and Yuen
have an offer on the table.

00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:03,282
I'll give you $1 million.

00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,150
(Daymond) Whoa.

00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,286
Wow.

00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:09,955
But I want 22%
of the business.

00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:11,824
There's one caveat.

00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:14,760
I want a monthly distribution
prorated to the owners.

00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,831
In other words, the partners--
Obviously, you are the majors--

00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:22,901
We get a check every month
from the free cash

00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,136
that's coming from franchisees.

00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:27,606
Percentage
we can negotiate in the future.

00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,541
That's the only request
I have,

00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,344
and you get $1 million.

00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:35,347
So you're giving them a value
of $5 million on the business?

00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:36,748
Less than. Less than.
(Mark) Less than $5 million.

00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:38,083
(Robert) Right.
And on top of that,

00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,618
he's getting
a check every month...

00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,887
(Kevin) Well, guys,
I want to tell you something.
To reduce his equity.

00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,755
I bring a lot of value
to the table here.

00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:45,424
I know this space.
Okay.

00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,426
Not sushi rolling,
But franchise...
Mm-hmm.

00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:48,627
And the economics
of investing in this.

00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,896
I'll force
some disciplines on you

00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,030
that you'll thank me for
five years from now.

00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,499
Ha!

00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,033
Can you--Can you elaborate
a little bit about

00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:56,468
what disciplines you might
be alluding to?

00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,669
(sharks laugh)

00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:59,004
All I'm saying is,

00:18:59,004 --> 00:18:59,738
the only covenant
I'm putting in place is--

00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:02,074
is to make you
more money monthly.

00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,142
I'm going to sit down
with you and negotiate

00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,010
what portion
of the free cash flow

00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,679
that comes from
the royalty stream

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,548
goes into your pocket
every month.
So it goes into you guys collectively?

00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:11,483
L-listen to what
he just said, though.

00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,684
But it goes into you
collectively, right?
Listen to what he just said.
He goes--

00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:15,154
It goes into you collectively.
No, listen to what
he just said.

00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,289
He said--Not only is he gonna
undervalue your valuation...

00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,624
(Kevin) I think actually
what you're hearing here is--
Versus the offer you have.

00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:21,560
On top of that, he's taking cash
out of the business upfront.
Mark never--Mark didn't...

00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,761
(Daymond) But with you.
Think of this structure.

00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:24,229
But he's taking the cash out
with you.
That's correct.

00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:25,497
(Mark) it doesn't matter!
(Kevin) I said prorated.

00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,366
But, Kevin, why would they

00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:30,002
have a firm offer
for their business at 6.6,

00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,734
and in their wildest
sake-instilled nightmare...

00:19:32,734 --> 00:19:34,000
But, Robert, here's--
Here's what's great about it.

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,300
Take your value of $5 million?

00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,567
It act--It actually doesn't
matter what you think.

00:19:36,567 --> 00:19:37,166
I couldn't care less.

00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,968
It's what they think
that matters.

00:19:38,968 --> 00:19:39,702
(laughs)
(Mark laughs) No kidding.

00:19:39,702 --> 00:19:41,304
I made you an offer.
It's very simple.

00:19:41,304 --> 00:19:42,838
I'll be your partner.

00:19:42,838 --> 00:19:43,506
I'm willing to give you
$1 million

00:19:43,506 --> 00:19:45,308
for 22% of the company.

00:19:45,308 --> 00:19:47,510
It's your vision. It's--
You still control it.

00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,578
You don't have to give up
control. I don't want control.

00:19:49,578 --> 00:19:51,847
I just want a return
on my investment.

00:19:51,847 --> 00:19:55,051
Is that too much to ask?
I don't think so.

00:19:55,051 --> 00:19:56,986
Are you willing to come down
on your--Your equity portion

00:19:56,986 --> 00:19:58,854
to 15%?

00:20:01,524 --> 00:20:02,959
I would meet you
in the middle.

00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:05,494
Okay.

00:20:05,494 --> 00:20:07,096
So you'd do it at 20%...

00:20:07,096 --> 00:20:07,430
Yeah.
Roughly?

00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,298
Are you not, uh, curious

00:20:09,298 --> 00:20:11,300
as to how much he wants to take
out of that business monthly?

00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,703
He has to have some number
in his head.

00:20:13,703 --> 00:20:16,266
No, I don't. I-I--
to leave that open-ended?

00:20:16,266 --> 00:20:17,934
Because you are actually
getting the lion's share

00:20:17,934 --> 00:20:19,269
of what comes out.

00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:20,604
That's true.

00:20:20,604 --> 00:20:21,567
So I wasn't thinking
about that.

00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:22,567
I was thinking that,
you know,

00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:23,901
even if we got crammed down
with this offer,

00:20:23,901 --> 00:20:26,571
uh, that we would still get
some share

00:20:26,571 --> 00:20:28,172
of--of the distribution.
Absolutely.

00:20:28,172 --> 00:20:29,907
So can we have a standing offer
so we can discuss?

00:20:29,907 --> 00:20:31,642
Absolutely, Yeah.
Thank you.

00:20:31,642 --> 00:20:32,633
Standing offer.

00:20:32,633 --> 00:20:33,968
That's an aggressive valuation,
Mr. O'Leary.

00:20:33,968 --> 00:20:35,837
I like it.
Of course you like it.

00:20:35,837 --> 00:20:37,405
So all you want to do
is basically--
No!

00:20:37,405 --> 00:20:38,873
All he wants to do
is protect his downside.

00:20:38,873 --> 00:20:40,274
Exactly.
They're--they're giving up
their upside

00:20:40,274 --> 00:20:42,543
because they think they
can get at least...
he made it sound so good.

00:20:42,543 --> 00:20:43,878
A 15% return on their cash,

00:20:43,878 --> 00:20:44,212
'cause that's what
their discount was

00:20:44,212 --> 00:20:45,880
in their discounted
cash flow model.

00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,215
I don't need your help
on this one, Mark.

00:20:47,215 --> 00:20:48,549
(chuckles)
I figured this one out myself.

00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:49,550
I'm not--I'm not
giving you help.

00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,285
I'm just sayin'--
Yeah, the key
with these guys is,

00:20:51,285 --> 00:20:52,753
I think they really need
the cash.

00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:55,022
Do you want to punt?

00:20:55,022 --> 00:20:55,356
I think so.

00:20:55,356 --> 00:20:57,225
You want to punt?
Yeah.

00:20:57,225 --> 00:20:58,226
Okay.
I think we have
other opportunities out there.

00:20:58,226 --> 00:21:00,027
Mm-hmm.

00:21:00,027 --> 00:21:02,296
Oh, here we go.

00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,538
Before we answer, we just
have a quick question.

00:21:10,538 --> 00:21:12,340
How are you gonna help us
with the real estate side,

00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,742
which has become
very problematic for us?

00:21:14,742 --> 00:21:16,277
There is no easy answer
to that.

00:21:16,277 --> 00:21:19,680
Even when you have
400 locations,

00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,482
every new one is a fi--
is a paramount fight.

00:21:21,482 --> 00:21:24,018
There's no question
about it.

00:21:24,018 --> 00:21:25,820
Right.
Those are
individual negotiations,

00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,133
every single time.
Right.

00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:30,166
Now you don't have a person
doing your real estate

00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:30,967
right now, do you?

00:21:30,967 --> 00:21:31,768
That is correct.
I am doing it.

00:21:31,768 --> 00:21:34,967
Yeah, but, you know,
you can't afford one

00:21:34,967 --> 00:21:36,836
till you're past 50 locations.

00:21:36,836 --> 00:21:38,904
You just can't.
You're gonna have to do it.

00:21:38,904 --> 00:21:40,239
Okay.
That's the answer.

00:21:40,239 --> 00:21:41,640
That's fair, yeah.

00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,975
'cause you're--
You're still too small.

00:21:42,975 --> 00:21:43,743
Right.

00:21:43,743 --> 00:21:45,300
You're going to reduce
your risk in some ways

00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,436
by growing a little slower,

00:21:47,436 --> 00:21:48,837
I think, whether you take me on
or not as a partner.

00:21:48,837 --> 00:21:49,504
Right.

00:21:49,504 --> 00:21:51,773
If I were you,
I'd take me on.
(chuckles)

00:21:51,773 --> 00:21:53,108
Okay.
(Robert laughs)

00:21:53,108 --> 00:21:54,976
Peter, what do you
want to do?

00:22:00,515 --> 00:22:02,584
Okay. I mean, if you feel like
that's the right decision.

00:22:02,584 --> 00:22:04,186
We'll take your offer.

00:22:04,186 --> 00:22:05,484
Whoa.
Wow.

00:22:05,484 --> 00:22:06,784
(Barbara) I wasn't sure.
All right.

00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:07,651
Kevin, I even started
to believe that crap.

00:22:07,651 --> 00:22:09,653
(Kevin) Thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you.

00:22:09,653 --> 00:22:10,988
Looking forward to it.
It sounds like a great offering.

00:22:10,988 --> 00:22:12,523
Thank you so much.
I'm looking forward
to working with you guys.

00:22:12,523 --> 00:22:13,857
Thank you. Thank you.
Appreciate it.

00:22:13,857 --> 00:22:15,192
Congratulations, guys.
(Yuen) Thank you, all.

00:22:15,192 --> 00:22:15,618
(Barbara) Bye-Bye.
Thank you so much.

00:22:15,618 --> 00:22:16,751
Appreciate it.
(Robert) Good job.

00:22:16,751 --> 00:22:19,287
Have a good day.
You made a deal with the devil.

00:22:19,287 --> 00:22:21,422
(exhales deeply)

00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:26,227
Wow. That was amazing.

00:22:26,227 --> 00:22:26,561
That was.

00:22:26,561 --> 00:22:28,896
We took Kevin's deal
of $1 million

00:22:28,896 --> 00:22:29,564
because ultimately,
we felt like

00:22:29,564 --> 00:22:31,566
the strategic alliance
with Kevin

00:22:31,566 --> 00:22:34,569
was gonna far outweigh
the other dollars.

00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:37,305
â™ªâ™ª

00:22:40,742 --> 00:22:43,411
â™ªâ™ª

00:22:43,411 --> 00:22:45,346
Next into the tank
is Bea Arthur,

00:22:45,346 --> 00:22:49,283
whose business aims to bring
some sanity into the world.

00:22:56,391 --> 00:22:58,192
Hello, sharks.

00:22:58,192 --> 00:22:59,861
My name is Bea Arthur,

00:22:59,861 --> 00:23:01,529
and, yes,
that is my real name.
(chuckles)

00:23:01,529 --> 00:23:06,200
And I am the founder and C.E.O.
of pretty padded room.

00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,671
I am asking $100,000
for 30% of my company.

00:23:10,671 --> 00:23:13,007
The practice of psychotherapy

00:23:13,007 --> 00:23:15,076
has been around for more than
a hundred years,

00:23:15,076 --> 00:23:16,010
and it's helped
millions of people,

00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:19,013
but it doesn't have
a really wonderful reputation.

00:23:19,013 --> 00:23:20,681
See, when most people
think "therapy,"

00:23:20,681 --> 00:23:24,185
they imagine paying $200
to be trapped in a room

00:23:24,185 --> 00:23:25,787
with this guy.

00:23:25,787 --> 00:23:30,124
(elderly male voice)
How does that make you feel?

00:23:30,124 --> 00:23:31,592
(laughs)
Creepy, right?

00:23:31,592 --> 00:23:33,194
So most of us tend
to solve our problems

00:23:33,194 --> 00:23:34,796
"the normal way,"

00:23:34,796 --> 00:23:37,999
by confiding
in a trusted friend.

00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,667
(female voice)
Honey, you don't need him.

00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:41,402
You need margaritas.

00:23:41,402 --> 00:23:43,471
Oh, yeah.
(Barbara laughs)

00:23:43,471 --> 00:23:46,140
She knows you inside and out,
and she's always there for you,

00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:49,076
but her advice
isn't always the best.

00:23:49,076 --> 00:23:50,411
In order to make counseling
more approachable

00:23:50,411 --> 00:23:51,746
and accessible,

00:23:51,746 --> 00:23:53,281
I felt we needed to provide

00:23:53,281 --> 00:23:54,749
the credentials
of an experienced therapist

00:23:54,749 --> 00:23:59,187
with the comfort and ease
of an old friend.

00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,455
So I broke all barriers

00:24:00,455 --> 00:24:01,989
and created
pretty padded room--

00:24:01,989 --> 00:24:05,326
a nice place to go crazy.

00:24:05,326 --> 00:24:08,329
Pretty padded room Provides
online therapy to women

00:24:08,329 --> 00:24:10,331
on their own time
and in their own space.

00:24:10,331 --> 00:24:13,468
We connect users
from all around the world

00:24:13,468 --> 00:24:15,136
with an all-female team
of licensed therapists

00:24:15,136 --> 00:24:17,271
through video chat
or a digital diary

00:24:17,271 --> 00:24:19,273
for just a fraction
of the price.

00:24:19,273 --> 00:24:21,275
As you can see,
pretty padded room

00:24:21,275 --> 00:24:23,544
has transformed
traditional therapy,

00:24:23,544 --> 00:24:25,079
completely redefined
the approach,

00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:29,484
and is now poised to dominate
in This very important space.

00:24:29,484 --> 00:24:32,053
So... How did that pitch
make you feel?

00:24:33,454 --> 00:24:35,389
(Kevin) So, Bea,
I can go online

00:24:35,389 --> 00:24:38,125
and get a credible,
licensed psychotherapist?

00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:39,460
Yes.

00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:39,927
What does it cost?

00:24:39,927 --> 00:24:43,397
A trial session at $20
is a 30-minute session,

00:24:43,397 --> 00:24:44,732
and it's either through
video chat

00:24:44,732 --> 00:24:46,267
or our digital diary,
which is where--

00:24:46,267 --> 00:24:48,069
And what are you paying
the doctor?

00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,403
We--It's a flat rate.

00:24:49,403 --> 00:24:51,539
So for $20,
they get $16 of that.

00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:53,207
For $40, they get $30.

00:24:53,207 --> 00:24:54,475
(Kevin) Yeah, it raises
the immediate question--

00:24:54,475 --> 00:24:56,477
If a therapist can't
generate their own practice

00:24:56,477 --> 00:24:58,333
at 150 bucks an hour,

00:24:58,333 --> 00:25:01,469
They'd be a discount therapist,
and they'd go to your deal,

00:25:01,469 --> 00:25:03,638
'cause they're getting paid
a whole lot less.

00:25:03,638 --> 00:25:05,306
Mm-hmm.

00:25:05,306 --> 00:25:07,575
So if I'm a good therapist,
why would I do this?

00:25:07,575 --> 00:25:09,644
I was actually trying to solve
two problems with this business.

00:25:09,644 --> 00:25:12,046
I really did want to make
therapy more approachable,

00:25:12,046 --> 00:25:15,717
and most importantly, affordable
for the average consumer.

00:25:15,717 --> 00:25:17,051
Also for new therapists
who are just starting out,

00:25:17,051 --> 00:25:19,520
it's actually very difficult
to just hang up a shingle

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,190
and just automatically
get clients like that.

00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:24,058
Is this only for women?
We're women-oriented,

00:25:24,058 --> 00:25:26,194
but we have about 6%
male membership, actually.

00:25:26,194 --> 00:25:28,062
It's a subscription-based
service.

00:25:28,062 --> 00:25:29,063
There's three tiers
of membership.

00:25:29,063 --> 00:25:31,065
$100 is
5 digital diary sessions,

00:25:31,065 --> 00:25:33,100
and that's when you can
write in to your therapist.

00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:33,768
It's an interactive journal.

00:25:33,768 --> 00:25:36,404
$150 is 4
30-minute sessions with video

00:25:36,404 --> 00:25:37,805
and one digital diary.

00:25:37,805 --> 00:25:40,875
At $200 is 4
45-minute sessions

00:25:40,875 --> 00:25:41,876
And three digital diaries.

00:25:41,876 --> 00:25:45,012
(Robert) Bea, when I use
the digital diary

00:25:45,012 --> 00:25:47,815
to write to a therapist,
am I doing that one-on-one?

00:25:47,815 --> 00:25:49,483
I'm basically e-mailing her?

00:25:49,483 --> 00:25:51,152
Or am I going through
your computer to do that?

00:25:51,152 --> 00:25:52,753
It's through the site, and a lot
of people appreciate that.

00:25:52,753 --> 00:25:53,688
It's a virtual office.

00:25:53,688 --> 00:25:56,023
I've been working on this for
about two and a half years.

00:25:56,023 --> 00:25:56,691
In our very first year,

00:25:56,691 --> 00:25:58,359
when we were offering
free sessions,

00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:00,027
and I was still working
my full-time job

00:26:00,027 --> 00:26:01,028
as a domestic violence
counselor,

00:26:01,028 --> 00:26:03,030
we did about $7,500
in sales.

00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:05,433
$7,500?

00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:06,968
Yes.

00:26:08,836 --> 00:26:10,471
(Mark) What was
your average session price?

00:26:10,471 --> 00:26:12,406
So we get an idea of the number
of sessions

00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:13,741
that people paid for?

00:26:13,741 --> 00:26:15,076
The first session
was free.

00:26:15,076 --> 00:26:15,810
In the first three months,

00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,612
about 600 people
did sign up.

00:26:17,612 --> 00:26:20,548
600 signed up, and then how many
actually paid for sessions?

00:26:20,548 --> 00:26:23,818
Um, originally, uh,

00:26:23,818 --> 00:26:26,554
so our conversion rate has
always been right around 40%.

00:26:26,554 --> 00:26:28,689
So people who try up,
about 40%

00:26:28,689 --> 00:26:30,491
end up going on
and signing up for memberships.

00:26:30,491 --> 00:26:33,561
The average customer stays on
for about three to six months.

00:26:33,561 --> 00:26:35,896
What are you on course
to do this year?

00:26:35,896 --> 00:26:38,032
$21,000,
and we're on track to--
(Barbara) But are you on target?

00:26:38,032 --> 00:26:40,034
Yes, at this moment,

00:26:40,034 --> 00:26:42,036
we're halfway through
our fiscal year.

00:26:42,036 --> 00:26:44,138
(Kevin) But does it bother you,
Bea, that after

00:26:44,138 --> 00:26:46,140
basically three years,
right,

00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,143
you're talking about doing
$20,000 in sales?

00:26:49,143 --> 00:26:50,678
I'm not even sure we're
proving the concept here.

00:26:50,678 --> 00:26:53,481
I mean, that is absolutely
nothing burger.

00:26:55,483 --> 00:26:57,485
(Mark) You've said
that the average customer

00:26:57,485 --> 00:26:59,153
is three months?

00:26:59,153 --> 00:27:00,621
Three to six months.

00:27:00,621 --> 00:27:01,622
So what's the lifetime,
um, revenue value

00:27:01,622 --> 00:27:04,291
of the customers
that you've had so far?

00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:04,825
Do you know?

00:27:04,825 --> 00:27:07,762
The lifetime revenue?

00:27:07,762 --> 00:27:11,165
So in other words,
the average customer

00:27:11,165 --> 00:27:13,501
is online for three months?

00:27:13,501 --> 00:27:15,237
Mm-hmm.

00:27:15,237 --> 00:27:16,804
How much revenue are you
typically collecting

00:27:16,804 --> 00:27:19,140
from that 3-Month customer?

00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,808
Between $300 and $500.

00:27:20,808 --> 00:27:22,877
So your average--So--
$300 and $600.

00:27:22,877 --> 00:27:25,012
I'm sorry?

00:27:25,012 --> 00:27:26,614
$300 and $600,
I'm sorry.

00:27:28,082 --> 00:27:29,083
Okay, so your--
That--That's a big range,

00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:30,418
so it's hard
to get a feel.

00:27:30,418 --> 00:27:32,219
Bea, something's not
adding up for me.

00:27:32,219 --> 00:27:35,956
You had 600 people come and do
a session the first year.

00:27:35,956 --> 00:27:39,960
If all the people
from the first year converted

00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,294
into paid customers,

00:27:40,294 --> 00:27:42,830
you would be doing
$60,000 a year

00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:45,833
under
your minimum subscription.

00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:46,500
Yes.

00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,502
But you're doing $15,000.

00:27:48,502 --> 00:27:51,338
So the drop-Off rate of people
that use the product once

00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:55,009
and don't sign up is huge.

00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:58,813
The numbers don't seem
to add up. Robert's right.

00:27:58,813 --> 00:28:02,616
You're basically
in an e-Commerce business.

00:28:02,616 --> 00:28:04,552
Mm-hmm.

00:28:04,552 --> 00:28:06,020
It happens to be your product
is psychotherapy counseling.

00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,556
It feels to me
like you need a partner

00:28:08,556 --> 00:28:10,224
that can explain to me,

00:28:10,224 --> 00:28:10,891
'cause you don't seem
to be able to do it,

00:28:10,891 --> 00:28:12,893
customer acquisition costs,

00:28:12,893 --> 00:28:14,895
margins, attrition--

00:28:14,895 --> 00:28:16,964
Which Robert identified
you have a huge attrition rate.

00:28:16,964 --> 00:28:20,501
In other words, people come,
use it, and just go away.

00:28:20,501 --> 00:28:22,036
That's not--
That's not True at all.

00:28:22,036 --> 00:28:23,437
I mean, our customers are
addicted to the site.

00:28:23,437 --> 00:28:24,937
Well, then why do you have
no sales?

00:28:24,937 --> 00:28:26,204
All of our business has been
through word of mouth.

00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,206
But you can't answer
one of those questions.

00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,941
Think about it. If you--
I--

00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:30,809
(Robert) Bea, your--
Your numbers aren't adding up.

00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:33,545
I mean, I--
they're just not.

00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,279
You... (sighs) I'm not--

00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,415
I am a non-Tech entrepreneur.
My background is--

00:28:36,415 --> 00:28:38,283
That's your answer?
(huffs)

00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:41,153
a non-Tech is a whole lot
different than non-numbers.

00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:42,621
I understand that.

00:28:42,621 --> 00:28:44,489
I'm building this.

00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:45,490
The first two years,
it's been extremely difficult.

00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,492
The learning curve
is very steep,

00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:48,693
but I've learned so much.

00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:50,695
And my vision
has been validated.

00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:51,696
People are in love
with This site.

00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:54,032
We get the--
it gets me high,

00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:55,033
the things that people
say about this site,

00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:56,635
and I get to help people.

00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:58,870
I just need to get clear
on the numbers.

00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,806
You just said it
right there.

00:29:00,806 --> 00:29:03,074
How can you come in here
and say,

00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,409
"I need to get clear
on the numbers"?

00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,278
I thought I had a good,
basic understanding of it.

00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:08,413
No, you were terrible.
(chuckles)

00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,681
Terrible.

00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:11,883
(Barbara)
Here's my spin--

00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:14,152
You have a great thing here,

00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:16,488
and I think it's creative
in a fresh way.

00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:19,491
And I think it's--
Even has a noble purpose.

00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:20,492
Right.

00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:24,896
But you did a terrible job
fumbling through the numbers.

00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:26,565
Ohh.

00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:28,300
But I have good news
for you.
Hmm?

00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,968
I'm terrible at numbers,

00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:31,937
and I'm rich.

00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:32,871
(laughs)

00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:35,607
All you really need here

00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:39,344
is to find the smartest
finance person you know

00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:41,947
who has an understanding
of technology

00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:43,949
and make them your partner.

00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:45,550
If you do that,
I have no doubt in my mind,

00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,085
you're gonna have
a great business.

00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:49,287
But I'm sure not gonna
invest in it today

00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,423
with that giant question mark
over the numbers.

00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:54,359
I'm sad to say I'm out.

00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:57,496
Aw. I kind of
felt like--Okay.

00:29:57,496 --> 00:29:59,231
Bea, Barbara is wrong.

00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:00,899
There are key metrics

00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:04,870
to every business
that you have to know.

00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,538
You can't subcontract that.

00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,740
No matter if you hire
an accountant or not...

00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,209
no, just get a partner
is what I said.
There are key numbers
in your business.

00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:12,878
(Robert)
When you have ignorance,

00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:14,279
you're not defensible.

00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,815
You can't fight back when you're
ignorant about your numbers.

00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,017
(sighs)

00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:19,351
I'm out.

00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:23,555
(Mark)
Bea, your vision's in place.

00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,357
You've gotten all the accolades
of people who like your site.

00:30:25,357 --> 00:30:27,359
You've gotta learn
the language of business.

00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:29,361
Otherwise you got no shot.

00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:30,495
And you've got
an opportunity here.

00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,963
Don't blow it,

00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:34,699
but I'm out.

00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:35,233
(Daymond) So, Bea,

00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:37,235
you obviously are doing
what you love

00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:39,004
and you have a passion.

00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:39,938
But it's scary,

00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:42,607
the problem you're having
with the numbers here.

00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:45,610
These numbers do not add up.

00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:46,945
I'm out.

00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:48,947
Well, thank you.
I do appreciate that.

00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:50,815
I think what's appropriate
is a very simple story

00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:52,417
that I think
you'll appreciate.

00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:55,353
There's an island right off
the coast of south africa

00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,822
where the largest population
of sardines exists.

00:30:57,822 --> 00:30:59,824
Seals love sardines.

00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:01,226
Hundreds of thousands of them
sit on an island--

00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:03,228
Just bare rock,
nothing to eat.

00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:04,963
They look at the sardines.

00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:06,364
After about seven days,
they start to starve.

00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,366
But they know
if they go in the water,

00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:11,937
the great white Sharks
will eat them alive.

00:31:11,937 --> 00:31:13,872
Somebody has to go in the water
from the Seals

00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,007
to sacrifice their lives

00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:17,409
so that the others can live,
eating the sardines.

00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:19,544
It's the one
that's starving the most

00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,879
that goes in first,

00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:21,880
followed by maybe
a few thousand more.

00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,482
The ones that sacrificed their
lives did it for a purpose--

00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:26,217
So the D.N.A. of the ones
that live can go on.

00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,753
So, Bea, do you know
who you are in this story?

00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:31,556
You're the first seal
that goes in the water.

00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,161
The purpose was that others

00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:38,430
will never come in here again
without their numbers.

00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,631
They will learn
from the blood in the waters

00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:42,233
that you've provided.

00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,469
I'm out.

00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,205
Good luck.

00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:49,941
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:50,675
Don't go swimming.

00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:55,013
(exhales)

00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:56,481
Let that be a lesson.

00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:58,283
She's smart.
She'll figure it out.

00:31:58,283 --> 00:31:59,951
(voice breaking) I'm here
representing my business,

00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:01,419
and I really, really resent

00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:04,422
having anybody call my business
or my project

00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:07,559
or anything that I've worked
this hard on... horrible.

00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,561
It isn't.

00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:12,230
â™ªâ™ª

00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:19,204
(crowing)

00:32:19,204 --> 00:32:22,741
â™ªâ™ª

00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:24,075
I'm T.J...
I'm Jaiden...

00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:24,409
I'm Emily...
I'm Kate...

00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:26,745
I'm Paige...
I'm Bryeton...

00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:28,947
and we're the inventioneers!

00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,149
â™ªâ™ª

00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:33,885
Well, the name says it all.
We're inventors.

00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:34,219
Look, guys. It's working.
(girl) whoo!

00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:35,620
(T.J.) we created
the inventioneers

00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,955
eight years ago
with the goal

00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,557
of changing the world
through our inventions.

00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:41,426
Come back here, you!
Come back!

00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:43,628
When we're not inventing,
we're just regular kids.

00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,564
We ride bikes, play soccer,
do homework together.

00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:48,366
We're just best friends.

00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:49,701
(grunts)

00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:50,335
We've invented a solution

00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:53,538
to one of the biggest problems
facing drivers today--

00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:54,939
Distracted driving.

00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:55,740
(all) Three, two, one.

00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,742
(cheering)

00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:58,610
(T.J.) right now our invention
is just a prototype.

00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,345
But we want to get it
out there to the public

00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:01,880
as soon as possible,

00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,481
and that's why
we need the sharks.

00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,483
(Bryeton) If we don't get
a deal with the sharks,

00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:08,219
then the world will miss out on
one of the most amazing products

00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:10,021
to ever hit the streets.

00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:11,356
(all) one, two, three!
Go, inventioneers!

00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:13,224
(cheering)

00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:16,227
â™ªâ™ª

00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:29,874
Hi. We're the inventioneers.

00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:31,543
My name is Bryeton.

00:33:31,543 --> 00:33:33,545
I'm here with T.J., Paige,

00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:35,814
Jaiden, Emily, and Kate.

00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:39,017
We're 6 inventors,
ages 12 to 18.

00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,819
Today we're looking for $100,000

00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:43,488
in exchange for 15%
of our company.

00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:45,890
(Paige) Sharks, as parents,

00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,358
you unfortunately know
that this

00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,360
is a very common occurrence
among teen drivers.
Stop it.

00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,695
(girls laugh)

00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,030
Teens think
they can multitask

00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,364
and drive safely.

00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,100
But they're faced
with distractions

00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,501
like cell phones, makeup,

00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:58,670
eating, drinking,

00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:01,005
and fooling around
with friends.

00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:01,873
Oh, my gosh.
(girls laugh)

00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,208
(laughs)
No way!

00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:04,943
That is so cool.

00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:07,145
Now, sharks,
please join our teen driver

00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:08,546
and imagine you are driving
down the freeway.

00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,548
Put your hands up
at 9 and 3.

00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,820
Now close your eyes.

00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:20,959
One, two, three, four.

00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:21,493
(bang)

00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:26,164
In those four seconds,

00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:28,767
our teen driver traveled
the length of a football field.

00:34:28,767 --> 00:34:31,336
Thankfully,
these kids are okay.

00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:33,338
But 18 teenagers die
every day in the U.S.

00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:35,073
From car crashes.

00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,875
The number-one cause--
You guessed it--

00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:38,943
Distracted driving.

00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:40,678
We want to make
a difference in the world

00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:42,147
by solving this problem.

00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:44,149
So... â™ª tada â™ª

00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:45,817
we created the smartwheel.

00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:47,285
(Paige) We realized
that most distractions

00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:50,755
require drivers to take one
or both hands off the wheel.

00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,825
So we thought
why not create a product

00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:56,361
that would alert drivers
when they make that mistake.

00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:57,362
And that's what
the smartwheel does.

00:34:57,362 --> 00:34:59,697
The smartwheel's
proprietary technology

00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:01,032
tracks
a driver's hand position

00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:04,035
and alerts the driver
through red lights and a tone

00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:07,672
if it detects one of three
unsafe hand positions.

00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:08,940
First is
no hands on the wheel.

00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,275
(beeps)

00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:11,676
That's obviously unsafe.

00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:13,411
Second,
one hand off the wheel

00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:16,414
is another
unsafe hand position...
(beeps)

00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:17,949
because it's a good indication
that the driver is distracted.

00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,951
And third
is two hands together...
(beeps)

00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,753
Which is a common
texting position.

00:35:21,753 --> 00:35:24,289
The smartwheel then
records the events

00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:27,091
and can alert third parties,
such as parents.

00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:28,359
Today we're looking for
your help

00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:30,829
to get our business
off the ground...

00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:33,498
(all) So that we can save lives,
and you can make money.

00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:35,900
(laughs)
(Barbara) Nice job.

00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,235
Thank you.

00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:39,137
(Mark)
guys, to get it rolling,

00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,005
is it a prototype or is it
a product right now?

00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:41,339
It's a prototype
right now.

00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:43,608
The first thing we're
gonna do

00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:44,943
with the $100,000

00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:46,277
is take approximately
$75,000 of it,

00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:50,148
um, and complete what we call
the final industrial design

00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,482
for manufacturing.

00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,618
We'll then use the remainder to
start our first production run.

00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:55,620
How are you gonna sell it?

00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,889
We plan on selling it
on the internet.

00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:00,091
Uh, we are open to going into
the big-Box stores eventually.

00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:01,559
And for how much?

00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:02,894
So we were planning on

00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:04,762
retailing the smartwheel
for $200.

00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:07,098
For cost to make it,

00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:08,566
we have professional estimates
that say $50.

00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:10,635
Let me ask you a question.

00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:12,604
You showed us all the activities
that teens shouldn't be doing.

00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:15,540
How does the device actually
stop them from doing it?

00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,609
It doesn't.
It just records it.

00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:20,478
You don't see a problem
with that?

00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:25,550
And let me suggest
a modification.

00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,885
Let's say
they're sitting there,

00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:28,137
they take
a hand off the wheel.

00:36:28,137 --> 00:36:29,739
They get a 120-volt shock.

00:36:29,739 --> 00:36:30,904
(all laugh)

00:36:30,904 --> 00:36:31,905
Maybe that's gonna work,
but I--

00:36:31,905 --> 00:36:34,908
It's not stopping anybody from
doing all of these bad things.

00:36:34,908 --> 00:36:36,643
It's just recording
the event.

00:36:38,445 --> 00:36:41,047
Guys, have you
demonstrated anywhere

00:36:41,047 --> 00:36:43,516
or put it in use for trials
or anything like that?

00:36:43,516 --> 00:36:45,885
Actually, one of
the first things we did, too,

00:36:45,885 --> 00:36:47,554
once we came up
with the idea,

00:36:47,554 --> 00:36:50,290
was to do a pilot study.

00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:51,291
You want to talk more
about that, Bryeton?

00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:53,693
At that pilot study,
90% of the pa--

00:36:53,693 --> 00:36:54,694
No, tell 'em where--
Where we did it at.

00:36:54,694 --> 00:36:57,097
At M.I.T.

00:36:57,097 --> 00:37:00,033
90% of the participants
said that

00:37:00,033 --> 00:37:01,167
the smartwheel
would be effective

00:37:01,167 --> 00:37:04,170
at changing
the driver's unsafe behavior.

00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:07,374
We had an order

00:37:07,374 --> 00:37:09,442
from a very high-ranking
government official.

00:37:09,442 --> 00:37:10,310
Do you want me to tell you
who he is?

00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,978
(Mark) Sure.

00:37:11,978 --> 00:37:13,380
How about president obama?

00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,383
We actually were invited
to the White house

00:37:16,383 --> 00:37:17,117
to present to him,

00:37:17,117 --> 00:37:18,418
and he loved the smartwheel
so much

00:37:18,418 --> 00:37:19,753
that he wants one
for his daughters

00:37:19,753 --> 00:37:22,289
when they're old enough
to drive.

00:37:22,289 --> 00:37:24,357
Wow.

00:37:24,357 --> 00:37:26,760
I would love to be part
of this.

00:37:28,895 --> 00:37:31,164
But honestly, the challenge is

00:37:31,164 --> 00:37:33,833
that I know absolutely nothing
about this space.

00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:35,168
I know manufacturing,

00:37:35,168 --> 00:37:37,771
but I don't know
electronic manufacturing.

00:37:37,771 --> 00:37:40,373
I can't offer you any value.

00:37:40,373 --> 00:37:41,775
I'm out.

00:37:45,779 --> 00:37:48,114
(Barbara)
I'm picturing myself

00:37:48,114 --> 00:37:49,783
introducing this
to my 17-year-old son.

00:37:49,783 --> 00:37:53,086
One pitch is, "Hey, This is
gonna help you drive safe,

00:37:53,086 --> 00:37:54,754
"and we're gonna get a report

00:37:54,754 --> 00:37:57,490
if you take your hands
off the wheel."

00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:59,492
That thing
ain't going on that car.

00:37:59,492 --> 00:38:00,694
If it's going on,
it's gonna come off quickly.

00:38:00,694 --> 00:38:04,030
I think you've gone
too far with the product.

00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:06,900
I think you have to eliminate
the report back to the parent.

00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,767
(Paige) But if we don't have
the reporting,

00:38:07,767 --> 00:38:10,570
then there's no incentive
for the teen to actually...

00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:13,039
Actually, yeah,
can I--can I--
work with the lights.

00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:14,574
No, you know what?
I don't agree with you.

00:38:14,574 --> 00:38:16,576
I think teenagers
do want to be safe,

00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,912
But they don't want their ma

00:38:18,912 --> 00:38:20,580
and their father looking over
their shoulder all the time.

00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,581
Right. You're--You're mi--
They want to get away.

00:38:21,581 --> 00:38:23,316
But then I do want to
bring up the numbers

00:38:23,316 --> 00:38:25,885
from our surveys that,
you know,

00:38:25,885 --> 00:38:28,221
85% of them said--
Teens agreed--

00:38:28,221 --> 00:38:31,024
Teens should use
the smartwheel and--

00:38:31,024 --> 00:38:31,891
I'm not convinced. I'm out.

00:38:37,097 --> 00:38:38,698
(Kevin)
Here's my take on this--

00:38:38,698 --> 00:38:39,899
You've achieved a whole lot,

00:38:39,899 --> 00:38:42,435
putting this
whole thing together.

00:38:42,435 --> 00:38:44,904
You've taken an idea and gone
all the way to the White House.

00:38:44,904 --> 00:38:46,573
That's cool.

00:38:46,573 --> 00:38:48,775
Now if you only had
a good idea,

00:38:48,775 --> 00:38:49,976
just think
what you'd be doing.

00:38:52,312 --> 00:38:53,646
You will one day come up
with a good product

00:38:53,646 --> 00:38:56,583
that I can invest in,
and when that day comes,

00:38:56,583 --> 00:38:58,618
you're invited
back through those doors,

00:38:58,618 --> 00:39:02,422
and I will write you a check.
But today, no. I'm out.

00:39:02,422 --> 00:39:05,959
â™ªâ™ª

00:39:11,364 --> 00:39:13,032
Three sharks are out.

00:39:13,032 --> 00:39:16,503
To get a deal,
the inventioneers need an offer

00:39:16,503 --> 00:39:18,171
from Robert or Mark.

00:39:18,171 --> 00:39:19,305
(Robert)
Here's where I'm at--

00:39:19,305 --> 00:39:20,774
I love cars, I race cars,

00:39:20,774 --> 00:39:22,776
I know
all the car company guys,

00:39:22,776 --> 00:39:25,311
and most importantly,

00:39:25,311 --> 00:39:28,047
I have a 16-year-old daughter
who just started to drive.

00:39:28,047 --> 00:39:30,116
I can't believe
this isn't an option

00:39:30,116 --> 00:39:32,118
within an existing car.

00:39:32,118 --> 00:39:34,220
Where I'm struggling
a little bit is,

00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,890
I think you're missing
the business that you're in.

00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,558
You think you're
in the smartwheel business,

00:39:38,558 --> 00:39:42,162
But the name of your company
or of you guys

00:39:42,162 --> 00:39:44,564
is the inventioneers.

00:39:44,564 --> 00:39:48,435
The smartwheel is simply
a product that you've invented.

00:39:48,435 --> 00:39:50,170
The thing to do
with a great invention

00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:52,906
is now go and sell it
to somebody.

00:39:52,906 --> 00:39:56,643
I think trying to manufacture it
and doing all this other stuff

00:39:56,643 --> 00:39:57,911
is just crazy.

00:40:01,381 --> 00:40:04,384
We did get, uh, another offer
to do a pilot study.

00:40:04,384 --> 00:40:05,351
We were actually able to talk

00:40:05,351 --> 00:40:07,754
with the U.S. Secretary
of Transportation Ray Lahood.

00:40:07,754 --> 00:40:09,956
He not only endorsed
the smartwheel,

00:40:09,956 --> 00:40:11,624
but he also offered
to set us up

00:40:11,624 --> 00:40:12,826
for a pilot study
on Mass transit vehicles.

00:40:15,161 --> 00:40:17,163
So what was the follow-up
to that?

00:40:17,163 --> 00:40:18,565
The follow-up is,

00:40:18,565 --> 00:40:20,633
we need more smartwheels
to test it with.

00:40:20,633 --> 00:40:24,170
(Robert) Here's what
I'm willing to do.

00:40:27,106 --> 00:40:30,577
I'll give you the $100,000
for 30%...

00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:34,447
contingent on

00:40:34,447 --> 00:40:36,316
taking it to a car company

00:40:36,316 --> 00:40:38,818
and them being interested
in moving forward

00:40:38,818 --> 00:40:41,020
with a licensing deal.

00:40:43,756 --> 00:40:46,025
Was anyone willing
to go in on that deal?

00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,028
What am I,
chopped liver to you?

00:40:49,028 --> 00:40:50,029
No, you are awesome.
My offer's not good enough?

00:40:50,029 --> 00:40:53,032
We are--we are on the edge
of our seats here.

00:40:53,032 --> 00:40:54,701
Robert,
I'll go in with you 50/50

00:40:54,701 --> 00:40:58,371
if you take out the contingency
on the car companies,

00:40:58,371 --> 00:41:00,707
because I think once we go
visit the car companies,

00:41:00,707 --> 00:41:03,309
and we've talked to them
not just about

00:41:03,309 --> 00:41:05,044
driver training for kids

00:41:05,044 --> 00:41:07,514
but also
the commercial applications,

00:41:07,514 --> 00:41:09,516
we have the opportunity
to pivot.

00:41:09,516 --> 00:41:11,918
My only issue is,
T.J.'s vision is to take...

00:41:11,918 --> 00:41:14,287
I agree. I-I agree.
The entire $100,000
to manufacture.

00:41:14,287 --> 00:41:15,154
I don't want to do that.

00:41:15,154 --> 00:41:16,756
No, I--Okay, so, T.J.,
would you be open to,

00:41:16,756 --> 00:41:19,025
once we discuss everything...
Mm-hmm.

00:41:19,025 --> 00:41:22,095
If the best course of action
is not necessarily

00:41:22,095 --> 00:41:24,097
to take that further along

00:41:24,097 --> 00:41:27,367
But talk to the car companies,
let them help us design it

00:41:27,367 --> 00:41:28,434
so we don't have to spend
all that money,

00:41:28,434 --> 00:41:30,436
so we have
a little dry powder left

00:41:30,436 --> 00:41:31,571
to--to evolve and pivot?

00:41:31,571 --> 00:41:33,373
Yeah.

00:41:33,373 --> 00:41:39,178
All right, Mark and I
will give you $100,000 for 30%.

00:41:39,178 --> 00:41:40,513
What do you say?

00:41:40,513 --> 00:41:42,382
No contingency?

00:41:42,382 --> 00:41:43,583
No contingency.

00:41:45,018 --> 00:41:47,086
That's a deal.

00:41:47,086 --> 00:41:49,489
(laughs)
All right.

00:41:49,489 --> 00:41:50,738
Thank you so much, guys.
Wow. Great job.

00:41:50,738 --> 00:41:52,371
Congratulations, guys.
Thank you.

00:41:52,371 --> 00:41:53,706
Thanks. Congratulations.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

00:41:53,706 --> 00:41:55,441
(Robert) I love cars.
This is so cool.

00:41:55,441 --> 00:41:56,776
Here.

00:41:56,776 --> 00:41:58,511
(imitates engine revving)

00:41:58,511 --> 00:41:59,445
(inventioneers laugh)

00:42:02,515 --> 00:42:03,850
(laughs) We did it.

00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:04,304
(singsongy)
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

00:42:04,304 --> 00:42:05,604
Oh, my gosh.

00:42:05,604 --> 00:42:06,504
We're investing
in these kids.

00:42:06,504 --> 00:42:08,372
They're super smart.
I--they are. They are.

00:42:08,372 --> 00:42:09,707
They're gonna do smart things.
They are gonna figure it out.

00:42:09,707 --> 00:42:10,641
I agree with you.
They're fantastic.

00:42:10,641 --> 00:42:14,245
But I have to also tell you,
I love the product.

00:42:14,245 --> 00:42:15,580
Jaiden's crying.

00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:16,914
(all laugh)

00:42:16,914 --> 00:42:18,282
It's okay. It's okay.

00:42:18,282 --> 00:42:19,617
(T.J.) Oh, wow.

00:42:19,617 --> 00:42:20,952
(girl) Oh, my goodness.

00:42:20,952 --> 00:42:22,420
I can't believe
that actually happened.

00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,421
(Jaiden, voice breaking)
The sharks actually

00:42:23,421 --> 00:42:25,222
treated us like adults,
and they valued our ideas.

00:42:25,222 --> 00:42:27,224
And it's great to see
someone else

00:42:27,224 --> 00:42:29,160
appreciate the smartwheel
as much as we do.

00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,162
(all) The inventioneers!

00:42:31,162 --> 00:42:34,098
(cheering)
