The sharks are back

00:00:01,869 --> 00:00:03,737
in an all-new season
of "Shark Tank,"

00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:07,567
where hopeful entrepreneurs
from across the country

00:00:07,567 --> 00:00:10,200
dream of a chance
to secure an investment

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,801
and gain powerful partners

00:00:11,801 --> 00:00:15,433
to start, grow, or save
their businesses.

00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:17,302
I decided to revolutionize
the dessert industry.

00:00:17,302 --> 00:00:20,038
(all) We can save lives,
and you can make money.

00:00:20,038 --> 00:00:22,040
If the sharks hear
a great idea,

00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,109
they're ready to invest
using their own money...

00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:26,845
I'll give you $1 million.

00:00:26,845 --> 00:00:29,647
And they'll fight each other
for a piece of the action.

00:00:29,647 --> 00:00:31,116

Kevin, why would they--

It doesn't matter
what you think.

00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,384
I couldn't care less.
It's what they think.

00:00:34,384 --> 00:00:37,187
But first the entrepreneurs
must convince a shark

00:00:37,187 --> 00:00:40,190
to invest the full amount
they're asking for

00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,192
or they'll walk away
with nothing.

00:00:42,192 --> 00:00:43,994
How can you come in here
and say,

00:00:43,994 --> 00:00:45,395
"I need to get clear
on the numbers"?

00:00:45,395 --> 00:00:46,730
I thought I had a good,
basic understanding of it.

00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,665
No, you were terrible.
It's sink...

00:00:48,665 --> 00:00:51,335

Or swim.

to remember something.

They are yummy.
Mmm.

00:03:08,197 --> 00:03:09,932
So the middle one
is dark chocolate.

00:03:09,932 --> 00:03:13,002
There's one that's chocolate
with caramel.

00:03:13,002 --> 00:03:14,937
And another half that is...

thank you.

a million calories.

It's only 200 calories,

00:03:23,713 --> 00:03:27,450
but I'm not trying
to market these as a fat-free.

00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,985

your very first s'muffin,

00:03:29,985 --> 00:03:33,255

are constantly coming back,

00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:37,460

00:03:44,915 --> 00:03:47,050
And that's just within
local mark--L.A. market.

What do you think
you're gonna do this year?

00:03:49,586 --> 00:03:53,457
This year, my forecast
is to do $165,000.

00:03:53,457 --> 00:03:54,758
How do you sell them,
Carmen?

00:03:54,758 --> 00:03:58,629
75% of my customers
come direct to me online

00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:00,631
or they phone in.

00:04:00,631 --> 00:04:01,965
That's been my primary focus
over the first two years.

00:04:01,965 --> 00:04:04,768
Do any stores
carry them as well?

00:04:04,768 --> 00:04:06,370
So there are a few stores
that carry 'em--

00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,239
Local specialty bakeries,
wine stores.

00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:09,973
(Mark)
How much do you sell it for

00:04:09,973 --> 00:04:11,375
and what does it
cost you to make?

00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,176
Costs me to make--

00:04:13,176 --> 00:04:14,845
$9.34 a dozen.

00:04:14,845 --> 00:04:17,648
I charge $29.95 a dozen.

00:04:17,648 --> 00:04:20,050
We deliver
throughout Los Angeles.

00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,719
And just recently, I was able to
launch the national shipping.

00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:25,122
These are the boxes
that I ship 'em in.

00:04:25,122 --> 00:04:26,423
So--
(Barbara)
You ship them frozen?

00:04:26,423 --> 00:04:28,158
Ship them frozen.

00:04:28,158 --> 00:04:29,426
5 pounds of dry ice
with a cooler.

00:04:29,426 --> 00:04:30,761
How much
is that cost for shipping?

00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:33,363
Shipping cost alone
is $54.

00:04:33,363 --> 00:04:34,698
Whoa.
That's a lot.

00:04:34,698 --> 00:04:36,299
Which is high, but...

00:04:36,299 --> 00:04:39,369
stop the madness, Carmen.
Let's walk through this.

00:04:39,369 --> 00:04:42,773
You've got a dozen little
shmuffins or shmores in there.

00:04:42,773 --> 00:04:45,442
And I have to pay 60 bucks
to get them...

00:04:45,442 --> 00:04:47,310
(laughs)
To my honey bunny in New York.

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,645
All right?
Mm-hmm.

00:04:48,645 --> 00:04:50,113
That is, like, 10 bucks
a shmore.

00:04:50,113 --> 00:04:52,115
That's right in line
with all my comp--

00:04:52,115 --> 00:04:53,650
All my competitors.

00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,986
Is there anything else
out in the market

00:04:55,986 --> 00:04:57,320
comparable to this?

00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,390
No. This is my baby.

00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,758
I trademarked
the name "S'muffin."

00:05:01,758 --> 00:05:03,760
I didn't want to just
call it a s'more

00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,229
because honestly, it's so much
more than a s'more.

00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:08,765
It's a shmuffin.

00:05:08,765 --> 00:05:09,833
It's a s'muffin.
I get it,

00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,368
but the cost
is freaking me out.

00:05:11,368 --> 00:05:14,200
I'm just thinking--
What--what do you think
is expensive?

00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,935
It's 10 bucks a shmuffer.

00:05:15,935 --> 00:05:16,869
(Daymond laughs)

00:05:16,869 --> 00:05:19,272
My target market--
They're high-end customers.

00:05:19,272 --> 00:05:21,540
They're used to paying
shipping...
(Robert) But why argue
with you, Carmen?

00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,875
And I'm getting--
You're doing it today. You're
selling them at that price.

00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,277
Yeah, and--
Not that many.

00:05:24,277 --> 00:05:25,544
You haven't sold many shmuffers
at that price.

00:05:25,544 --> 00:05:27,667
She sells $165,000 a year.

00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:29,536
Are you selling
a lot of product

00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:31,538
that costs $60 a box?

00:05:31,538 --> 00:05:32,472
Come on.
Yes.

00:05:32,472 --> 00:05:34,574
That's crazy.
$50--

00:05:34,574 --> 00:05:36,776
Am I the only person
Who says that's insane?

00:05:36,776 --> 00:05:38,245
(laughs)

00:05:38,245 --> 00:05:39,579
I mean, you fedex this
across the country...

00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:41,581
you wouldn't bel--
Or you send your children
to college.

00:05:41,581 --> 00:05:42,916
(Mark and Daymond laugh)
You choose one.

00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,918
You wouldn't--
Like, think about that.

00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:45,719
You wouldn't believe

00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:47,787
the frenzy
that these things create.

00:05:47,787 --> 00:05:51,858
This is
the next dessert craze.

00:05:51,858 --> 00:05:53,393
All right, Carmen. I'm not
gonna invest in your shmagels.

00:05:53,393 --> 00:05:56,329
I'm out.

00:05:56,329 --> 00:05:58,865
(laughs) Sorry, Carmen.

00:05:58,865 --> 00:06:00,400
What's your background?

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,536
I was an advertising
sales executive.

00:06:03,536 --> 00:06:05,538
I was laid off
during the recession.

00:06:05,538 --> 00:06:06,206
I got a severance package.

00:06:06,206 --> 00:06:09,042
My husband and I
had always dreamed

00:06:09,042 --> 00:06:12,646
of starting a s'more store,
and--

00:06:12,646 --> 00:06:13,647
What?

00:06:13,647 --> 00:06:15,048
I-I never met somebody Who
loves s'mores more than you.

00:06:15,048 --> 00:06:17,183
(laughs)
When you say "s'more,"

00:06:17,183 --> 00:06:18,451
it brings back
happy memories,

00:06:18,451 --> 00:06:20,387
and people
automatically smile.

00:06:20,387 --> 00:06:23,123
I see this all the time
at events.

00:06:23,123 --> 00:06:24,791
They're like, "Oh, my gosh.
These are unique.

00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:25,592
What is this, a cupcake?"

00:06:25,592 --> 00:06:27,327
I'm like, "Oh, no.
It's better than a cupcake.

00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,862
It's a s'muffin."

00:06:28,862 --> 00:06:31,464
And then they taste it,
and then just fall over.

00:06:31,464 --> 00:06:34,868
Then they order it
and go bankrupt.
(Daymond laughing)

00:06:34,868 --> 00:06:35,268
They come back.

00:06:35,268 --> 00:06:37,604
They come back
and they order over and over.

00:06:37,604 --> 00:06:41,274
My biggest cost
was investing

00:06:41,274 --> 00:06:44,311
in getting
the national shipping down.

00:06:44,311 --> 00:06:45,979
Why didn't you just
stay local then?
Yeah, like why are you--

00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:47,314
if it was gonna cost you
all your money--

00:06:47,314 --> 00:06:48,648
'cause I don't want
to stay local.

00:06:48,648 --> 00:06:50,450
I want everybody to be able
to have these.

00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,718
I want s'muffins
and gotta have s'mores...

00:06:51,718 --> 00:06:53,386
that's completely
different, though, than--
to be a national name.

00:06:53,386 --> 00:06:55,722
That's a whole different thing
than trying to make money.

00:06:55,722 --> 00:06:57,857
You have a huge market
in Los Angeles.

00:06:57,857 --> 00:06:58,191
Mm-hmm.

00:06:58,191 --> 00:06:59,659
And you've got
willing customers.

00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:01,795
Why focus on
trying to solve a problem

00:07:01,795 --> 00:07:02,529
that's not really
a problem?

00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:04,931
This was one focus.
(chuckles)

00:07:04,931 --> 00:07:06,800
I'm also now wanting
to start focusing

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,400
on wholesaling as well.
(laughs)

Carmen, you're so in love
with your s'muffins,

00:07:11,004 --> 00:07:13,606
you can't see the dollars
from the marshmallows.

00:07:13,606 --> 00:07:15,575
I'm out.

(Robert) Carmen,

00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,446
you put yourself in a position

00:07:19,446 --> 00:07:21,781
where you have to ask for
$75,000 from us

00:07:21,781 --> 00:07:26,720
and give up 25% equity
to fix a problem

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,788
that isn't generating
any sales.

00:07:28,788 --> 00:07:31,057
All I see is problems.

00:07:31,057 --> 00:07:34,861
I see it as building
my distribution.

00:07:34,861 --> 00:07:36,196
The s'muffins were good.
I'm out.

00:07:38,198 --> 00:07:41,668
Your strategy is, uh,
s'muffin crazy.

00:07:41,668 --> 00:07:44,738
So, um, I'm out.

00:07:44,738 --> 00:07:48,108
I like nothing more
than a real s'more.

00:07:48,108 --> 00:07:50,777
But when I tasted this,

00:07:50,777 --> 00:07:52,245
it didn't taste anything
really like it.

00:07:52,245 --> 00:07:55,849
So I'm going out just because
I don't like the muffin.

00:07:55,849 --> 00:07:58,385
And I feel badly
telling you that.

00:07:58,385 --> 00:07:59,986
Okay.
Okay?

00:07:59,986 --> 00:08:01,921
But good luck to you.

00:08:01,921 --> 00:08:03,390
Thank you.

00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,525
(Carmen) It was just weird

00:08:05,525 --> 00:08:09,195
that they didn't
go bananas over them.

00:08:09,195 --> 00:08:12,132
It's almost like I was
in the twilight zone... (laughs)

00:08:12,132 --> 00:08:16,336
Because that was--That's not
the typical reaction.

00:08:16,336 --> 00:08:19,472
How can there only be
a dozen of them in that box?

00:08:19,472 --> 00:08:20,740
'cause it's full of ice.

Before "Shark Tank," I sold
$75,000 worth of product,

Hey, Donny.
Welcome to Dee zee.

00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,984
I've solved that problem

00:09:04,984 --> 00:09:05,985
by signing a licensing deal
with a company

00:09:05,985 --> 00:09:07,987
in Des Moines, Iowa,
called Dee Zee.

00:09:07,987 --> 00:09:09,656

production ramped up,

I believe
the sky's the limit.

Looks great.

Well, we both grew up

00:10:05,517 --> 00:10:07,119
Our parents had several
Chinese restaurants.

00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:08,186
So at the tender age
of 8 and 9,

00:10:08,186 --> 00:10:10,522
we both started working

Option number one
was to go to

sushi restaurant

trying to impress people
you really don't like.

So that leaves you
with your second option.

You go down to
the local grocery store,

00:11:46,971 --> 00:11:50,041
you get a premade roll

with family,"

We have sold 40 total.

00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,890

15 of them opened,

two of them
are corporate stores.

are our own.

00:13:50,906 --> 00:13:51,974
So far, so good.
Knock on wood.

00:13:51,974 --> 00:13:53,642
Are they profitable?
They are.

00:13:53,642 --> 00:13:56,879
What's the average bill
in the sit-Down restaurant?

00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:59,148
Roughly, it's around
$10 to $12.

00:13:59,148 --> 00:14:01,283
Sushi's good.
Let's talk money.
Yeah.

00:14:01,283 --> 00:14:03,285
You're offering me 12%
of the corporate entity...

00:14:03,285 --> 00:14:04,620
correct.

00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,621
That owns
all the franchise flows

00:14:05,621 --> 00:14:07,623
for $1 million.

00:14:07,623 --> 00:14:09,291
That is correct.

00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,759
So what is this year's
cash flow gonna look like?

00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:14,096
Just on royalties,
it's $250,000 a year.

00:14:14,096 --> 00:14:14,897
Wow.

00:14:17,432 --> 00:14:19,434
What are your sales
in the corporate stores?

00:14:19,434 --> 00:14:21,170
Oh, uh, one is running
600-something-thousand,

00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:24,039
and the other one
is running $400,000.

00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:24,907
(Barbara)
I would like to ask,

00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:27,309
I'm going to buy a franchise.

00:14:27,309 --> 00:14:29,278
Tell me
what I have to pay you.

00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:31,613
Okay. So the all-in cost
of the franchise,

00:14:31,613 --> 00:14:33,348
including the $20,000
in franchise fee,

00:14:33,348 --> 00:14:36,018
the building out of the store,
buying the equipment--

00:14:36,018 --> 00:14:39,154
$270,000, $300,000 all in.
Mm-hmm.

00:14:39,154 --> 00:14:40,489
(Daymond) So it looks like--
now they're in business.

00:14:40,489 --> 00:14:42,224
Yes.
But what happens after that?

00:14:42,224 --> 00:14:43,358
You get a percentage
of what they sell?

00:14:43,358 --> 00:14:44,760
That is correct.
A royalty.

00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,427
What's your royalty rate?

00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:46,762
Our royalty rate is 7%.

00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:48,363
What are the compliance systems
you have

00:14:48,363 --> 00:14:49,898
to make sure
you're getting paid?

00:14:49,898 --> 00:14:51,233
Uh, we suck it right out
of their checking account

00:14:51,233 --> 00:14:52,634
every week.

00:14:52,634 --> 00:14:53,569
(laughs)
So you mean, in other words,

00:14:53,569 --> 00:14:55,237
they have to set up
a corporate account...
that is correct.

00:14:55,237 --> 00:14:56,972
(Mark) Guys,
let me jump first.

00:14:56,972 --> 00:14:59,575
I-I like the idea.
I like the concept.

00:14:59,575 --> 00:15:02,144
But that's
a brutally competitive area.

00:15:02,144 --> 00:15:04,813
I don't want to be
in the sushi business,

00:15:04,813 --> 00:15:07,216
so I'm out.

00:15:11,086 --> 00:15:13,488
(Kevin) I-I'm looking at it
from a different perspective.

00:15:13,488 --> 00:15:15,157
I believe
it's very well managed.

00:15:15,157 --> 00:15:15,824
I think
your presentation's excellent.

00:15:15,824 --> 00:15:17,492
And you have
the right combination--

00:15:17,492 --> 00:15:19,228
The chef guy
with the finance guy.

00:15:19,228 --> 00:15:22,231
That's perfect.
The valuation is rich.

00:15:22,231 --> 00:15:23,232
It--It is probably
a little bit high.

00:15:23,232 --> 00:15:26,435
We--we have had a, uh,
letter of intent sent to us

00:15:26,435 --> 00:15:29,037
to, uh, buy 75%
of the company.

00:15:29,037 --> 00:15:30,639
And, uh, that valuation

00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,641
came in at 6.6.
Ah.

00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:34,533
Are you going
to do that deal?

00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:35,834
Uh, I-I don't think so.

00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:37,169
I don't think you should.

00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:38,837
Yeah, the reason why is,
because number one,

00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,973
I don't want to lose
that much of the company.

00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:42,975
Uh, really, honestly,
with the opening

00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,176
of, uh, four or five
more stores,

00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:46,645
our royalties will--will--
Will get us to--

00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:48,781
to profitability.
What's your geography right now?
Are they all in Texas?

00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:52,184
No. They are in, uh,
California, Marina Del Rey,

00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:53,519
uh, we have one
in Phoenix, Arizona,

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,454
Tucson, Arizona.

00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,989
Yuen, I got--I gotta tell you,
man, you--You started a business

00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:57,656
a few years ago,

00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:01,927
and someone's offering you
$6.6 million in cash...

00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,529
Mm-hmm.
You'd be
a multimillionaire overnight,

00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,931
and you're just talking about
turning it down like that.

00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:06,598
We are.
Power to you,
'cause I gotta tell you,

00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:08,934
the first time somebody
offered me a million bucks...

00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:10,235
Yeah.

00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:11,570
I--it took me weeks
to say no.

00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,372
I understand.
I wanted to grab that check...

00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,307
right.
And run.

00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:15,908
(Yuen and Barbara laugh)

00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:18,644
(Daymond) So, guys, the profit
that you make in food

00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,246
is in appetizers,

00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,649
liquor and/or beverages,
and desserts.

00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,917
There's no money in this,

00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,986
and you're selling fish--
Fresh fish.

00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,654
I think that the margins
are gonna be too low.

00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,589
I'm out.

00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,324
Okay.

00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,394
Great presentation.

00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,329
Uh, more importantly,
great food.

00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,531
Um...

00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:40,799
I can't help you
with the operation.

00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:45,104
I don't understand
this particular food model.

00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,706
You're running
a great, great business.

00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,842
Thank you.

00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:50,509
I'll bring all my buddies,
we'll spend a lot of money...

00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,378
okay. Thank you.

00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:55,647
But we're not gonna spend
$1 million to invest today.

00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,850
I'm out.

00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,253
You have 15 locations
in 2 1/2 years.

00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:03,188
That is correct.
Amazing.

00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:03,522
Thank you.

00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,791
I have recently gotten involved

00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,126
in two different
food franchises,

00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:10,062
and I'm quickly learning
how complicated it is.

00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:11,397
It can be.

00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,332
So I have great respect
for where you came from

00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:13,932
and how far you got.

00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,601
Thank you.
But I mistrust it.

00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:16,902
I think your presentation
is so buttoned up...

00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:18,570
uh-huh.

00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,440
And for my liking,
a little too buttoned up.

00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,576
So I'm gonna trust my gut
on this. I'm out.

00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,578
Okay.

00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:27,646
Um...

00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,581
I like your business.
I like you guys.

00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:30,916
Thank you.

00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,585
So I'll make you
an offer.

00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:36,121
I'll give you $1 million.

00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:37,656
(Daymond) Whoa.

00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,124
Wow.

00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:42,394
But I want 22%
of the business.

00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,200
And there's one caveat.

00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,438
♪♪

00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:57,743
Four sharks are out,

00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,412
and Peter and Yuen
have an offer on the table.

00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:03,282
I'll give you $1 million.

00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,150
(Daymond) Whoa.

00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,286
Wow.

00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:09,955
But I want 22%
of the business.

00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:11,824
There's one caveat.

00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:14,760
I want a monthly distribution
prorated to the owners.

00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,831
In other words, the partners--
Obviously, you are the majors--

00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:22,901
We get a check every month
from the free cash

00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,136
that's coming from franchisees.

00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:27,606
Percentage
we can negotiate in the future.

00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,541
That's the only request
I have,

00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,344
and you get $1 million.

00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:35,347
So you're giving them a value
of $5 million on the business?

00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:36,748
Less than. Less than.
(Mark) Less than $5 million.

00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:38,083
(Robert) Right.
And on top of that,

00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,618
he's getting
a check every month...

00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,887
(Kevin) Well, guys,
I want to tell you something.
To reduce his equity.

00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,755
I bring a lot of value
to the table here.

00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:45,424
I know this space.
Okay.

00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,426
Not sushi rolling,
But franchise...
Mm-hmm.

00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:48,627
And the economics
of investing in this.

00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,896
I'll force
some disciplines on you

00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,030
that you'll thank me for
five years from now.

00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,499
Ha!

00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,033
Can you--Can you elaborate
a little bit about

00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:56,468
what disciplines you might
be alluding to?

00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,669
(sharks laugh)

00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:59,004
All I'm saying is,

00:18:59,004 --> 00:18:59,738
the only covenant
I'm putting in place is--

00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:02,074
is to make you
more money monthly.

00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,142
I'm going to sit down
with you and negotiate

00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,010
what portion
of the free cash flow

00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,679
that comes from
the royalty stream

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,548
goes into your pocket
every month.
So it goes into you guys collectively?

00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:11,483
L-listen to what
he just said, though.

00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,684
But it goes into you
collectively, right?
Listen to what he just said.
He goes--

00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:15,154
It goes into you collectively.
No, listen to what
he just said.

00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,289
He said--Not only is he gonna
undervalue your valuation...

00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,624
(Kevin) I think actually
what you're hearing here is--
Versus the offer you have.

00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:21,560
On top of that, he's taking cash
out of the business upfront.
Mark never--Mark didn't...

00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,761
(Daymond) But with you.
Think of this structure.

00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:24,229
But he's taking the cash out
with you.
That's correct.

00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:25,497
(Mark) it doesn't matter!
(Kevin) I said prorated.

00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,366
But, Kevin, why would they

00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:30,002
have a firm offer
for their business at 6.6,

00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,734
and in their wildest
sake-instilled nightmare...

00:19:32,734 --> 00:19:34,000
But, Robert, here's--
Here's what's great about it.

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,300
Take your value of $5 million?

00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,567
It act--It actually doesn't
matter what you think.

00:19:36,567 --> 00:19:37,166
I couldn't care less.

00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,968
It's what they think
that matters.

00:19:38,968 --> 00:19:39,702
(laughs)
(Mark laughs) No kidding.

00:19:39,702 --> 00:19:41,304
I made you an offer.
It's very simple.

00:19:41,304 --> 00:19:42,838
I'll be your partner.

00:19:42,838 --> 00:19:43,506
I'm willing to give you
$1 million

00:19:43,506 --> 00:19:45,308
for 22% of the company.

00:19:45,308 --> 00:19:47,510
It's your vision. It's--
You still control it.

00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,578
You don't have to give up
control. I don't want control.

00:19:49,578 --> 00:19:51,847
I just want a return
on my investment.

00:19:51,847 --> 00:19:55,051
Is that too much to ask?
I don't think so.

00:19:55,051 --> 00:19:56,986
Are you willing to come down
on your--Your equity portion

00:19:56,986 --> 00:19:58,854
to 15%?

00:20:01,524 --> 00:20:02,959
I would meet you
in the middle.

00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:05,494
Okay.

00:20:05,494 --> 00:20:07,096
So you'd do it at 20%...

00:20:07,096 --> 00:20:07,430
Yeah.
Roughly?

00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,298
Are you not, uh, curious

00:20:09,298 --> 00:20:11,300
as to how much he wants to take
out of that business monthly?

00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,703
He has to have some number
in his head.

00:20:13,703 --> 00:20:16,266
No, I don't. I-I--
to leave that open-ended?

00:20:16,266 --> 00:20:17,934
Because you are actually
getting the lion's share

00:20:17,934 --> 00:20:19,269
of what comes out.

00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:20,604
That's true.

00:20:20,604 --> 00:20:21,567
So I wasn't thinking
about that.

00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:22,567
I was thinking that,
you know,

00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:23,901
even if we got crammed down
with this offer,

00:20:23,901 --> 00:20:26,571
uh, that we would still get
some share

00:20:26,571 --> 00:20:28,172
of--of the distribution.
Absolutely.

00:20:28,172 --> 00:20:29,907
So can we have a standing offer
so we can discuss?

00:20:29,907 --> 00:20:31,642
Absolutely, Yeah.
Thank you.

00:20:31,642 --> 00:20:32,633
Standing offer.

00:20:32,633 --> 00:20:33,968
That's an aggressive valuation,
Mr. O'Leary.

00:20:33,968 --> 00:20:35,837
I like it.
Of course you like it.

00:20:35,837 --> 00:20:37,405
So all you want to do
is basically--
No!

00:20:37,405 --> 00:20:38,873
All he wants to do
is protect his downside.

00:20:38,873 --> 00:20:40,274
Exactly.
They're--they're giving up
their upside

00:20:40,274 --> 00:20:42,543
because they think they
can get at least...
he made it sound so good.

00:20:42,543 --> 00:20:43,878
A 15% return on their cash,

00:20:43,878 --> 00:20:44,212
'cause that's what
their discount was

00:20:44,212 --> 00:20:45,880
in their discounted
cash flow model.

00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,215
I don't need your help
on this one, Mark.

00:20:47,215 --> 00:20:48,549
(chuckles)
I figured this one out myself.

00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:49,550
I'm not--I'm not
giving you help.

00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,285
I'm just sayin'--
Yeah, the key
with these guys is,

00:20:51,285 --> 00:20:52,753
I think they really need
the cash.

00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:55,022
Do you want to punt?

00:20:55,022 --> 00:20:55,356
I think so.

00:20:55,356 --> 00:20:57,225
You want to punt?
Yeah.

00:20:57,225 --> 00:20:58,226
Okay.
I think we have
other opportunities out there.

00:20:58,226 --> 00:21:00,027
Mm-hmm.

00:21:00,027 --> 00:21:02,296
Oh, here we go.

00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,538
Before we answer, we just
have a quick question.

00:21:10,538 --> 00:21:12,340
How are you gonna help us
with the real estate side,

00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,742
which has become
very problematic for us?

00:21:14,742 --> 00:21:16,277
There is no easy answer
to that.

00:21:16,277 --> 00:21:19,680
Even when you have
400 locations,

00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,482
every new one is a fi--
is a paramount fight.

00:21:21,482 --> 00:21:24,018
There's no question
about it.

00:21:24,018 --> 00:21:25,820
Right.
Those are
individual negotiations,

00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,133
every single time.
Right.

00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:30,166
Now you don't have a person
doing your real estate

00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:30,967
right now, do you?

00:21:30,967 --> 00:21:31,768
That is correct.
I am doing it.

00:21:31,768 --> 00:21:34,967
Yeah, but, you know,
you can't afford one

00:21:34,967 --> 00:21:36,836
till you're past 50 locations.

00:21:36,836 --> 00:21:38,904
You just can't.
You're gonna have to do it.

00:21:38,904 --> 00:21:40,239
Okay.
That's the answer.

00:21:40,239 --> 00:21:41,640
That's fair, yeah.

00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,975
'cause you're--
You're still too small.

00:21:42,975 --> 00:21:43,743
Right.

00:21:43,743 --> 00:21:45,300
You're going to reduce
your risk in some ways

00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,436
by growing a little slower,

00:21:47,436 --> 00:21:48,837
I think, whether you take me on
or not as a partner.

00:21:48,837 --> 00:21:49,504
Right.

00:21:49,504 --> 00:21:51,773
If I were you,
I'd take me on.
(chuckles)

00:21:51,773 --> 00:21:53,108
Okay.
(Robert laughs)

00:21:53,108 --> 00:21:54,976
Peter, what do you
want to do?

00:22:00,515 --> 00:22:02,584
Okay. I mean, if you feel like
that's the right decision.

00:22:02,584 --> 00:22:04,186
We'll take your offer.

00:22:04,186 --> 00:22:05,484
Whoa.
Wow.

00:22:05,484 --> 00:22:06,784
(Barbara) I wasn't sure.
All right.

00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:07,651
Kevin, I even started
to believe that crap.

00:22:07,651 --> 00:22:09,653
(Kevin) Thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you.

00:22:09,653 --> 00:22:10,988
Looking forward to it.
It sounds like a great offering.

00:22:10,988 --> 00:22:12,523
Thank you so much.
I'm looking forward
to working with you guys.

00:22:12,523 --> 00:22:13,857
Thank you. Thank you.
Appreciate it.

00:22:13,857 --> 00:22:15,192
Congratulations, guys.
(Yuen) Thank you, all.

00:22:15,192 --> 00:22:15,618
(Barbara) Bye-Bye.
Thank you so much.

00:22:15,618 --> 00:22:16,751
Appreciate it.
(Robert) Good job.

00:22:16,751 --> 00:22:19,287
Have a good day.
You made a deal with the devil.

00:22:19,287 --> 00:22:21,422
(exhales deeply)

00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:26,227
Wow. That was amazing.

00:22:26,227 --> 00:22:26,561
That was.

00:22:26,561 --> 00:22:28,896
We took Kevin's deal
of $1 million

00:22:28,896 --> 00:22:29,564
because ultimately,
we felt like

00:22:29,564 --> 00:22:31,566
the strategic alliance
with Kevin

00:22:31,566 --> 00:22:34,569
was gonna far outweigh
the other dollars.

00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:37,305
♪♪

00:22:40,742 --> 00:22:43,411
♪♪

00:22:43,411 --> 00:22:45,346
Next into the tank
is Bea Arthur,

00:22:45,346 --> 00:22:49,283
whose business aims to bring
some sanity into the world.

00:22:56,391 --> 00:22:58,192
Hello, sharks.

00:22:58,192 --> 00:22:59,861
My name is Bea Arthur,

00:22:59,861 --> 00:23:01,529
and, yes,
that is my real name.
(chuckles)

00:23:01,529 --> 00:23:06,200
And I am the founder and C.E.O.
of pretty padded room.

00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,671
I am asking $100,000
for 30% of my company.

00:23:10,671 --> 00:23:13,007
The practice of psychotherapy

00:23:13,007 --> 00:23:15,076
has been around for more than
a hundred years,

00:23:15,076 --> 00:23:16,010
and it's helped
millions of people,

00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:19,013
but it doesn't have
a really wonderful reputation.

00:23:19,013 --> 00:23:20,681
See, when most people
think "therapy,"

00:23:20,681 --> 00:23:24,185
they imagine paying $200
to be trapped in a room

00:23:24,185 --> 00:23:25,787
with this guy.

00:23:25,787 --> 00:23:30,124
(elderly male voice)
How does that make you feel?

00:23:30,124 --> 00:23:31,592
(laughs)
Creepy, right?

00:23:31,592 --> 00:23:33,194
So most of us tend
to solve our problems

00:23:33,194 --> 00:23:34,796
"the normal way,"

00:23:34,796 --> 00:23:37,999
by confiding
in a trusted friend.

00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,667
(female voice)
Honey, you don't need him.

00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:41,402
You need margaritas.

00:23:41,402 --> 00:23:43,471
Oh, yeah.
(Barbara laughs)

00:23:43,471 --> 00:23:46,140
She knows you inside and out,
and she's always there for you,

00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:49,076
but her advice
isn't always the best.

00:23:49,076 --> 00:23:50,411
In order to make counseling
more approachable

00:23:50,411 --> 00:23:51,746
and accessible,

00:23:51,746 --> 00:23:53,281
I felt we needed to provide

00:23:53,281 --> 00:23:54,749
the credentials
of an experienced therapist

00:23:54,749 --> 00:23:59,187
with the comfort and ease
of an old friend.

00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,455
So I broke all barriers

00:24:00,455 --> 00:24:01,989
and created
pretty padded room--

00:24:01,989 --> 00:24:05,326
a nice place to go crazy.

00:24:05,326 --> 00:24:08,329
Pretty padded room Provides
online therapy to women

00:24:08,329 --> 00:24:10,331
on their own time
and in their own space.

00:24:10,331 --> 00:24:13,468
We connect users
from all around the world

00:24:13,468 --> 00:24:15,136
with an all-female team
of licensed therapists

00:24:15,136 --> 00:24:17,271
through video chat
or a digital diary

00:24:17,271 --> 00:24:19,273
for just a fraction
of the price.

00:24:19,273 --> 00:24:21,275
As you can see,
pretty padded room

00:24:21,275 --> 00:24:23,544
has transformed
traditional therapy,

00:24:23,544 --> 00:24:25,079
completely redefined
the approach,

00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:29,484
and is now poised to dominate
in This very important space.

00:24:29,484 --> 00:24:32,053
So... How did that pitch
make you feel?

00:24:33,454 --> 00:24:35,389
(Kevin) So, Bea,
I can go online

00:24:35,389 --> 00:24:38,125
and get a credible,
licensed psychotherapist?

00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:39,460
Yes.

00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:39,927
What does it cost?

00:24:39,927 --> 00:24:43,397
A trial session at $20
is a 30-minute session,

00:24:43,397 --> 00:24:44,732
and it's either through
video chat

00:24:44,732 --> 00:24:46,267
or our digital diary,
which is where--

00:24:46,267 --> 00:24:48,069
And what are you paying
the doctor?

00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,403
We--It's a flat rate.

00:24:49,403 --> 00:24:51,539
So for $20,
they get $16 of that.

00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:53,207
For $40, they get $30.

00:24:53,207 --> 00:24:54,475
(Kevin) Yeah, it raises
the immediate question--

00:24:54,475 --> 00:24:56,477
If a therapist can't
generate their own practice

00:24:56,477 --> 00:24:58,333
at 150 bucks an hour,

00:24:58,333 --> 00:25:01,469
They'd be a discount therapist,
and they'd go to your deal,

00:25:01,469 --> 00:25:03,638
'cause they're getting paid
a whole lot less.

00:25:03,638 --> 00:25:05,306
Mm-hmm.

00:25:05,306 --> 00:25:07,575
So if I'm a good therapist,
why would I do this?

00:25:07,575 --> 00:25:09,644
I was actually trying to solve
two problems with this business.

00:25:09,644 --> 00:25:12,046
I really did want to make
therapy more approachable,

00:25:12,046 --> 00:25:15,717
and most importantly, affordable
for the average consumer.

00:25:15,717 --> 00:25:17,051
Also for new therapists
who are just starting out,

00:25:17,051 --> 00:25:19,520
it's actually very difficult
to just hang up a shingle

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,190
and just automatically
get clients like that.

00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:24,058
Is this only for women?
We're women-oriented,

00:25:24,058 --> 00:25:26,194
but we have about 6%
male membership, actually.

00:25:26,194 --> 00:25:28,062
It's a subscription-based
service.

00:25:28,062 --> 00:25:29,063
There's three tiers
of membership.

00:25:29,063 --> 00:25:31,065
$100 is
5 digital diary sessions,

00:25:31,065 --> 00:25:33,100
and that's when you can
write in to your therapist.

00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:33,768
It's an interactive journal.

00:25:33,768 --> 00:25:36,404
$150 is 4
30-minute sessions with video

00:25:36,404 --> 00:25:37,805
and one digital diary.

00:25:37,805 --> 00:25:40,875
At $200 is 4
45-minute sessions

00:25:40,875 --> 00:25:41,876
And three digital diaries.

00:25:41,876 --> 00:25:45,012
(Robert) Bea, when I use
the digital diary

00:25:45,012 --> 00:25:47,815
to write to a therapist,
am I doing that one-on-one?

00:25:47,815 --> 00:25:49,483
I'm basically e-mailing her?

00:25:49,483 --> 00:25:51,152
Or am I going through
your computer to do that?

00:25:51,152 --> 00:25:52,753
It's through the site, and a lot
of people appreciate that.

00:25:52,753 --> 00:25:53,688
It's a virtual office.

00:25:53,688 --> 00:25:56,023
I've been working on this for
about two and a half years.

00:25:56,023 --> 00:25:56,691
In our very first year,

00:25:56,691 --> 00:25:58,359
when we were offering
free sessions,

00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:00,027
and I was still working
my full-time job

00:26:00,027 --> 00:26:01,028
as a domestic violence
counselor,

00:26:01,028 --> 00:26:03,030
we did about $7,500
in sales.

00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:05,433
$7,500?

00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:06,968
Yes.

00:26:08,836 --> 00:26:10,471
(Mark) What was
your average session price?

00:26:10,471 --> 00:26:12,406
So we get an idea of the number
of sessions

00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:13,741
that people paid for?

00:26:13,741 --> 00:26:15,076
The first session
was free.

00:26:15,076 --> 00:26:15,810
In the first three months,

00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,612
about 600 people
did sign up.

00:26:17,612 --> 00:26:20,548
600 signed up, and then how many
actually paid for sessions?

00:26:20,548 --> 00:26:23,818
Um, originally, uh,

00:26:23,818 --> 00:26:26,554
so our conversion rate has
always been right around 40%.

00:26:26,554 --> 00:26:28,689
So people who try up,
about 40%

00:26:28,689 --> 00:26:30,491
end up going on
and signing up for memberships.

00:26:30,491 --> 00:26:33,561
The average customer stays on
for about three to six months.

00:26:33,561 --> 00:26:35,896
What are you on course
to do this year?

00:26:35,896 --> 00:26:38,032
$21,000,
and we're on track to--
(Barbara) But are you on target?

00:26:38,032 --> 00:26:40,034
Yes, at this moment,

00:26:40,034 --> 00:26:42,036
we're halfway through
our fiscal year.

00:26:42,036 --> 00:26:44,138
(Kevin) But does it bother you,
Bea, that after

00:26:44,138 --> 00:26:46,140
basically three years,
right,

00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,143
you're talking about doing
$20,000 in sales?

00:26:49,143 --> 00:26:50,678
I'm not even sure we're
proving the concept here.

00:26:50,678 --> 00:26:53,481
I mean, that is absolutely
nothing burger.

00:26:55,483 --> 00:26:57,485
(Mark) You've said
that the average customer

00:26:57,485 --> 00:26:59,153
is three months?

00:26:59,153 --> 00:27:00,621
Three to six months.

00:27:00,621 --> 00:27:01,622
So what's the lifetime,
um, revenue value

00:27:01,622 --> 00:27:04,291
of the customers
that you've had so far?

00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:04,825
Do you know?

00:27:04,825 --> 00:27:07,762
The lifetime revenue?

00:27:07,762 --> 00:27:11,165
So in other words,
the average customer

00:27:11,165 --> 00:27:13,501
is online for three months?

00:27:13,501 --> 00:27:15,237
Mm-hmm.

00:27:15,237 --> 00:27:16,804
How much revenue are you
typically collecting

00:27:16,804 --> 00:27:19,140
from that 3-Month customer?

00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,808
Between $300 and $500.

00:27:20,808 --> 00:27:22,877
So your average--So--
$300 and $600.

00:27:22,877 --> 00:27:25,012
I'm sorry?

00:27:25,012 --> 00:27:26,614
$300 and $600,
I'm sorry.

00:27:28,082 --> 00:27:29,083
Okay, so your--
That--That's a big range,

00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:30,418
so it's hard
to get a feel.

00:27:30,418 --> 00:27:32,219
Bea, something's not
adding up for me.

00:27:32,219 --> 00:27:35,956
You had 600 people come and do
a session the first year.

00:27:35,956 --> 00:27:39,960
If all the people
from the first year converted

00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,294
into paid customers,

00:27:40,294 --> 00:27:42,830
you would be doing
$60,000 a year

00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:45,833
under
your minimum subscription.

00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:46,500
Yes.

00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,502
But you're doing $15,000.

00:27:48,502 --> 00:27:51,338
So the drop-Off rate of people
that use the product once

00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:55,009
and don't sign up is huge.

00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:58,813
The numbers don't seem
to add up. Robert's right.

00:27:58,813 --> 00:28:02,616
You're basically
in an e-Commerce business.

00:28:02,616 --> 00:28:04,552
Mm-hmm.

00:28:04,552 --> 00:28:06,020
It happens to be your product
is psychotherapy counseling.

00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,556
It feels to me
like you need a partner

00:28:08,556 --> 00:28:10,224
that can explain to me,

00:28:10,224 --> 00:28:10,891
'cause you don't seem
to be able to do it,

00:28:10,891 --> 00:28:12,893
customer acquisition costs,

00:28:12,893 --> 00:28:14,895
margins, attrition--

00:28:14,895 --> 00:28:16,964
Which Robert identified
you have a huge attrition rate.

00:28:16,964 --> 00:28:20,501
In other words, people come,
use it, and just go away.

00:28:20,501 --> 00:28:22,036
That's not--
That's not True at all.

00:28:22,036 --> 00:28:23,437
I mean, our customers are
addicted to the site.

00:28:23,437 --> 00:28:24,937
Well, then why do you have
no sales?

00:28:24,937 --> 00:28:26,204
All of our business has been
through word of mouth.

00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,206
But you can't answer
one of those questions.

00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,941
Think about it. If you--
I--

00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:30,809
(Robert) Bea, your--
Your numbers aren't adding up.

00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:33,545
I mean, I--
they're just not.

00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,279
You... (sighs) I'm not--

00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,415
I am a non-Tech entrepreneur.
My background is--

00:28:36,415 --> 00:28:38,283
That's your answer?
(huffs)

00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:41,153
a non-Tech is a whole lot
different than non-numbers.

00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:42,621
I understand that.

00:28:42,621 --> 00:28:44,489
I'm building this.

00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:45,490
The first two years,
it's been extremely difficult.

00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,492
The learning curve
is very steep,

00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:48,693
but I've learned so much.

00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:50,695
And my vision
has been validated.

00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:51,696
People are in love
with This site.

00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:54,032
We get the--
it gets me high,

00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:55,033
the things that people
say about this site,

00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:56,635
and I get to help people.

00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:58,870
I just need to get clear
on the numbers.

00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,806
You just said it
right there.

00:29:00,806 --> 00:29:03,074
How can you come in here
and say,

00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,409
"I need to get clear
on the numbers"?

00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,278
I thought I had a good,
basic understanding of it.

00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:08,413
No, you were terrible.
(chuckles)

00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,681
Terrible.

00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:11,883
(Barbara)
Here's my spin--

00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:14,152
You have a great thing here,

00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:16,488
and I think it's creative
in a fresh way.

00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:19,491
And I think it's--
Even has a noble purpose.

00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:20,492
Right.

00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:24,896
But you did a terrible job
fumbling through the numbers.

00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:26,565
Ohh.

00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:28,300
But I have good news
for you.
Hmm?

00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,968
I'm terrible at numbers,

00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:31,937
and I'm rich.

00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:32,871
(laughs)

00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:35,607
All you really need here

00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:39,344
is to find the smartest
finance person you know

00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:41,947
who has an understanding
of technology

00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:43,949
and make them your partner.

00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:45,550
If you do that,
I have no doubt in my mind,

00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,085
you're gonna have
a great business.

00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:49,287
But I'm sure not gonna
invest in it today

00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,423
with that giant question mark
over the numbers.

00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:54,359
I'm sad to say I'm out.

00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:57,496
Aw. I kind of
felt like--Okay.

00:29:57,496 --> 00:29:59,231
Bea, Barbara is wrong.

00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:00,899
There are key metrics

00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:04,870
to every business
that you have to know.

00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,538
You can't subcontract that.

00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,740
No matter if you hire
an accountant or not...

00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,209
no, just get a partner
is what I said.
There are key numbers
in your business.

00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:12,878
(Robert)
When you have ignorance,

00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:14,279
you're not defensible.

00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,815
You can't fight back when you're
ignorant about your numbers.

00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,017
(sighs)

00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:19,351
I'm out.

00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:23,555
(Mark)
Bea, your vision's in place.

00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,357
You've gotten all the accolades
of people who like your site.

00:30:25,357 --> 00:30:27,359
You've gotta learn
the language of business.

00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:29,361
Otherwise you got no shot.

00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:30,495
And you've got
an opportunity here.

00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,963
Don't blow it,

00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:34,699
but I'm out.

00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:35,233
(Daymond) So, Bea,

00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:37,235
you obviously are doing
what you love

00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:39,004
and you have a passion.

00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:39,938
But it's scary,

00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:42,607
the problem you're having
with the numbers here.

00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:45,610
These numbers do not add up.

00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:46,945
I'm out.

00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:48,947
Well, thank you.
I do appreciate that.

00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:50,815
I think what's appropriate
is a very simple story

00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:52,417
that I think
you'll appreciate.

00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:55,353
There's an island right off
the coast of south africa

00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,822
where the largest population
of sardines exists.

00:30:57,822 --> 00:30:59,824
Seals love sardines.

00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:01,226
Hundreds of thousands of them
sit on an island--

00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:03,228
Just bare rock,
nothing to eat.

00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:04,963
They look at the sardines.

00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:06,364
After about seven days,
they start to starve.

00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,366
But they know
if they go in the water,

00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:11,937
the great white Sharks
will eat them alive.

00:31:11,937 --> 00:31:13,872
Somebody has to go in the water
from the Seals

00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,007
to sacrifice their lives

00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:17,409
so that the others can live,
eating the sardines.

00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:19,544
It's the one
that's starving the most

00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,879
that goes in first,

00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:21,880
followed by maybe
a few thousand more.

00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,482
The ones that sacrificed their
lives did it for a purpose--

00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:26,217
So the D.N.A. of the ones
that live can go on.

00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,753
So, Bea, do you know
who you are in this story?

00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:31,556
You're the first seal
that goes in the water.

00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,161
The purpose was that others

00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:38,430
will never come in here again
without their numbers.

00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,631
They will learn
from the blood in the waters

00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:42,233
that you've provided.

00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,469
I'm out.

00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,205

No way!

00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:04,943
That is so cool.

00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:07,145
Now, sharks,
please join our teen driver

00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:08,546
and imagine you are driving
down the freeway.

00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,548
Put your hands up
at 9 and 3.

00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,820
Now close your eyes.

00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:20,959
One, two, three, four.

00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:21,493
(bang)

00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:26,164
In those four seconds,

00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:28,767
our teen driver traveled
the length of a football field.

00:34:28,767 --> 00:34:31,336
Thankfully,
these kids are okay.

00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:33,338
But 18 teenagers die
every day in the U.S.

00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:35,073
From car crashes.

00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,875
The number-one cause--
You guessed it--

00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:38,943
Distracted driving.

00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:40,678
We want to make
a difference in the world

00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:42,147
by solving this problem.

00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:44,149
So... ♪ tada ♪

00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:45,817
we created the smartwheel.

00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:47,285
(Paige) We realized
that most distractions

00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:50,755
require drivers to take one
or both hands off the wheel.

00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,825
So we thought
why not create a product

00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:56,361
that would alert drivers
when they make that mistake.

00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:57,362
And that's what
the smartwheel does.

00:34:57,362 --> 00:34:59,697
The smartwheel's
proprietary technology

00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:01,032
tracks
a driver's hand position

00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:04,035
and alerts the driver
through red lights and a tone

00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:07,672
if it detects one of three
unsafe hand positions.

00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:08,940
First is
no hands on the wheel.

00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,275
(beeps)

00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:11,676
That's obviously unsafe.

00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:13,411
Second,
one hand off the wheel

00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:16,414
is another
unsafe hand position...
(beeps)

00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:17,949
because it's a good indication
that the driver is distracted.

00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,951
And third
is two hands together...
(beeps)

00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,753
Which is a common
texting position.

00:35:21,753 --> 00:35:24,289
The smartwheel then
records the events

00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:27,091
and can alert third parties,
such as parents.

00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:28,359
Today we're looking for
your help

00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:30,829
to get our business
off the ground...

00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:33,498
(all) So that we can save lives,
and you can make money.

00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:35,900
(laughs)
(Barbara) Nice job.

00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,235
Thank you.

00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:39,137
(Mark)
guys, to get it rolling,

00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,005
is it a prototype or is it
a product right now?

00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:41,339
It's a prototype
right now.

00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:43,608
The first thing we're
gonna do

00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:44,943
with the $100,000

00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:46,277
is take approximately
$75,000 of it,

00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:50,148
um, and complete what we call
the final industrial design

00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,482
for manufacturing.

00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,618
We'll then use the remainder to
start our first production run.

00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:55,620
How are you gonna sell it?

00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,889
We plan on selling it
on the internet.

00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:00,091
Uh, we are open to going into
the big-Box stores eventually.

00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:01,559
And for how much?

00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:02,894
So we were planning on

00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:04,762
retailing the smartwheel
for $200.

00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:07,098
For cost to make it,

00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:08,566
we have professional estimates
that say $50.

00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:10,635
Let me ask you a question.

00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:12,604
You showed us all the activities
that teens shouldn't be doing.

00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:15,540
How does the device actually
stop them from doing it?

00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,609
It doesn't.
It just records it.

00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:20,478
You don't see a problem
with that?

00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:25,550
And let me suggest
a modification.

00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,885
Let's say
they're sitting there,

00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:28,137
they take
a hand off the wheel.

00:36:28,137 --> 00:36:29,739
They get a 120-volt shock.

00:36:29,739 --> 00:36:30,904
(all laugh)

00:36:30,904 --> 00:36:31,905
Maybe that's gonna work,
but I--

00:36:31,905 --> 00:36:34,908
It's not stopping anybody from
doing all of these bad things.

00:36:34,908 --> 00:36:36,643
It's just recording
the event.

00:36:38,445 --> 00:36:41,047
Guys, have you
demonstrated anywhere

00:36:41,047 --> 00:36:43,516
or put it in use for trials
or anything like that?

00:36:43,516 --> 00:36:45,885
Actually, one of
the first things we did, too,

00:36:45,885 --> 00:36:47,554
once we came up
with the idea,

00:36:47,554 --> 00:36:50,290
was to do a pilot study.

00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:51,291
You want to talk more
about that, Bryeton?

00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:53,693
At that pilot study,
90% of the pa--

00:36:53,693 --> 00:36:54,694
No, tell 'em where--
Where we did it at.

00:36:54,694 --> 00:36:57,097
At M.I.T.

00:36:57,097 --> 00:37:00,033
90% of the participants
said that

00:37:00,033 --> 00:37:01,167
the smartwheel
would be effective

00:37:01,167 --> 00:37:04,170
at changing
the driver's unsafe behavior.

00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:07,374
We had an order

00:37:07,374 --> 00:37:09,442
from a very high-ranking
government official.

00:37:09,442 --> 00:37:10,310
Do you want me to tell you
who he is?

00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,978
(Mark) Sure.

00:37:11,978 --> 00:37:13,380
How about president obama?

00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,383
We actually were invited
to the White house

00:37:16,383 --> 00:37:17,117
to present to him,

00:37:17,117 --> 00:37:18,418
and he loved the smartwheel
so much

00:37:18,418 --> 00:37:19,753
that he wants one
for his daughters

00:37:19,753 --> 00:37:22,289
when they're old enough
to drive.

00:37:22,289 --> 00:37:24,357
Wow.

00:37:24,357 --> 00:37:26,760
I would love to be part
of this.

00:37:28,895 --> 00:37:31,164
But honestly, the challenge is

00:37:31,164 --> 00:37:33,833
that I know absolutely nothing
about this space.

00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:35,168
I know manufacturing,

00:37:35,168 --> 00:37:37,771
but I don't know
electronic manufacturing.

00:37:37,771 --> 00:37:40,373
I can't offer you any value.

00:37:40,373 --> 00:37:41,775
I'm out.

00:37:45,779 --> 00:37:48,114
(Barbara)
I'm picturing myself

00:37:48,114 --> 00:37:49,783
introducing this
to my 17-year-old son.

00:37:49,783 --> 00:37:53,086
One pitch is, "Hey, This is
gonna help you drive safe,

00:37:53,086 --> 00:37:54,754
"and we're gonna get a report

00:37:54,754 --> 00:37:57,490
if you take your hands
off the wheel."

00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:59,492
That thing
ain't going on that car.

00:37:59,492 --> 00:38:00,694
If it's going on,
it's gonna come off quickly.

00:38:00,694 --> 00:38:04,030
I think you've gone
too far with the product.

00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:06,900
I think you have to eliminate
the report back to the parent.

00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,767
(Paige) But if we don't have
the reporting,

00:38:07,767 --> 00:38:10,570
then there's no incentive
for the teen to actually...

00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:13,039
Actually, yeah,
can I--can I--
work with the lights.

00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:14,574
No, you know what?
I don't agree with you.

00:38:14,574 --> 00:38:16,576
I think teenagers
do want to be safe,

00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,912
But they don't want their ma

00:38:18,912 --> 00:38:20,580
and their father looking over
their shoulder all the time.

00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,581
Right. You're--You're mi--
They want to get away.

00:38:21,581 --> 00:38:23,316
But then I do want to
bring up the numbers

00:38:23,316 --> 00:38:25,885
from our surveys that,
you know,

00:38:25,885 --> 00:38:28,221
85% of them said--
Teens agreed--

00:38:28,221 --> 00:38:31,024
Teens should use
the smartwheel and--

00:38:31,024 --> 00:38:31,891
I'm not convinced. I'm out.

00:38:37,097 --> 00:38:38,698
(Kevin)
Here's my take on this--

00:38:38,698 --> 00:38:39,899
You've achieved a whole lot,

00:38:39,899 --> 00:38:42,435
putting this
whole thing together.

00:38:42,435 --> 00:38:44,904
You've taken an idea and gone
all the way to the White House.

00:38:44,904 --> 00:38:46,573
That's cool.

00:38:46,573 --> 00:38:48,775
Now if you only had
a good idea,

00:38:48,775 --> 00:38:49,976
just think
what you'd be doing.

00:38:52,312 --> 00:38:53,646
You will one day come up
with a good product

00:38:53,646 --> 00:38:56,583
that I can invest in,
and when that day comes,

00:38:56,583 --> 00:38:58,618
you're invited
back through those doors,

00:38:58,618 --> 00:39:02,422
and I will write you a check.
But today, no. I'm out.

00:39:02,422 --> 00:39:05,959
♪♪

00:39:11,364 --> 00:39:13,032
Three sharks are out.

00:39:13,032 --> 00:39:16,503
To get a deal,
the inventioneers need an offer

00:39:16,503 --> 00:39:18,171
from Robert or Mark.

00:39:18,171 --> 00:39:19,305
(Robert)
Here's where I'm at--

00:39:19,305 --> 00:39:20,774
I love cars, I race cars,

00:39:20,774 --> 00:39:22,776
I know
all the car company guys,

00:39:22,776 --> 00:39:25,311
and most importantly,

00:39:25,311 --> 00:39:28,047
I have a 16-year-old daughter
who just started to drive.

00:39:28,047 --> 00:39:30,116
I can't believe
this isn't an option

00:39:30,116 --> 00:39:32,118
within an existing car.

00:39:32,118 --> 00:39:34,220
Where I'm struggling
a little bit is,

00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,890
I think you're missing
the business that you're in.

00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,558
You think you're
in the smartwheel business,

00:39:38,558 --> 00:39:42,162
But the name of your company
or of you guys

00:39:42,162 --> 00:39:44,564
is the inventioneers.

00:39:44,564 --> 00:39:48,435
The smartwheel is simply
a product that you've invented.

00:39:48,435 --> 00:39:50,170
The thing to do
with a great invention

00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:52,906
is now go and sell it
to somebody.

00:39:52,906 --> 00:39:56,643
I think trying to manufacture it
and doing all this other stuff

00:39:56,643 --> 00:39:57,911
is just crazy.

00:40:01,381 --> 00:40:04,384
We did get, uh, another offer
to do a pilot study.

00:40:04,384 --> 00:40:05,351
We were actually able to talk

00:40:05,351 --> 00:40:07,754
with the U.S. Secretary
of Transportation Ray Lahood.

00:40:07,754 --> 00:40:09,956
He not only endorsed
the smartwheel,

00:40:09,956 --> 00:40:11,624
but he also offered
to set us up

00:40:11,624 --> 00:40:12,826
for a pilot study
on Mass transit vehicles.

00:40:15,161 --> 00:40:17,163
So what was the follow-up
to that?

00:40:17,163 --> 00:40:18,565
The follow-up is,

00:40:18,565 --> 00:40:20,633
we need more smartwheels
to test it with.

00:40:20,633 --> 00:40:24,170
(Robert) Here's what
I'm willing to do.

00:40:27,106 --> 00:40:30,577
I'll give you the $100,000
for 30%...

00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:34,447
contingent on

00:40:34,447 --> 00:40:36,316
taking it to a car company

00:40:36,316 --> 00:40:38,818
and them being interested
in moving forward

00:40:38,818 --> 00:40:41,020
with a licensing deal.

00:40:43,756 --> 00:40:46,025
Was anyone willing
to go in on that deal?

00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,028
What am I,
chopped liver to you?

00:40:49,028 --> 00:40:50,029
No, you are awesome.
My offer's not good enough?

00:40:50,029 --> 00:40:53,032
We are--we are on the edge
of our seats here.

00:40:53,032 --> 00:40:54,701
Robert,
I'll go in with you 50/50

00:40:54,701 --> 00:40:58,371
if you take out the contingency
on the car companies,

00:40:58,371 --> 00:41:00,707
because I think once we go
visit the car companies,

00:41:00,707 --> 00:41:03,309
and we've talked to them
not just about

00:41:03,309 --> 00:41:05,044
driver training for kids

00:41:05,044 --> 00:41:07,514
but also
the commercial applications,

00:41:07,514 --> 00:41:09,516
we have the opportunity
to pivot.

00:41:09,516 --> 00:41:11,918
My only issue is,
T.J.'s vision is to take...

00:41:11,918 --> 00:41:14,287
I agree. I-I agree.
The entire $100,000
to manufacture.

00:41:14,287 --> 00:41:15,154
I don't want to do that.

00:41:15,154 --> 00:41:16,756
No, I--Okay, so, T.J.,
would you be open to,

00:41:16,756 --> 00:41:19,025
once we discuss everything...
Mm-hmm.

00:41:19,025 --> 00:41:22,095
If the best course of action
is not necessarily

00:41:22,095 --> 00:41:24,097
to take that further along

00:41:24,097 --> 00:41:27,367
But talk to the car companies,
let them help us design it

00:41:27,367 --> 00:41:28,434
so we don't have to spend
all that money,

00:41:28,434 --> 00:41:30,436
so we have
a little dry powder left

00:41:30,436 --> 00:41:31,571
to--to evolve and pivot?

00:41:31,571 --> 00:41:33,373
Yeah.

00:41:33,373 --> 00:41:39,178
All right, Mark and I
will give you $100,000 for 30%.

00:41:39,178 --> 00:41:40,513
What do you say?

00:41:40,513 --> 00:41:42,382
No contingency?

00:41:42,382 --> 00:41:43,583
No contingency.

00:41:45,018 --> 00:41:47,086
That's a deal.

00:41:47,086 --> 00:41:49,489
(laughs)
All right.

00:41:49,489 --> 00:41:50,738
Thank you so much, guys.
Wow. Great job.

00:41:50,738 --> 00:41:52,371
Congratulations, guys.
Thank you.

00:41:52,371 --> 00:41:53,706
Thanks. Congratulations.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

00:41:53,706 --> 00:41:55,441
(Robert) I love cars.
This is so cool.

00:41:55,441 --> 00:41:56,776
Here.

00:41:56,776 --> 00:41:58,511
(imitates engine revving)

00:41:58,511 --> 00:41:59,445
(inventioneers laugh)

00:42:02,515 --> 00:42:03,850
(laughs) We did it.

00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:04,304
(singsongy)
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

00:42:04,304 --> 00:42:05,604
Oh, my gosh.

00:42:05,604 --> 00:42:06,504
We're investing
in these kids.

00:42:06,504 --> 00:42:08,372
They're super smart.
I--they are. They are.

00:42:08,372 --> 00:42:09,707
They're gonna do smart things.
They are gonna figure it out.

00:42:09,707 --> 00:42:10,641
I agree with you.
They're fantastic.

00:42:10,641 --> 00:42:14,245
But I have to also tell you,
I love the product.

00:42:14,245 --> 00:42:15,580
Jaiden's crying.

00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:16,914
(all laugh)

00:42:16,914 --> 00:42:18,282
It's okay. It's okay.

00:42:18,282 --> 00:42:19,617
(T.J.) Oh, wow.

00:42:19,617 --> 00:42:20,952
(girl) Oh, my goodness.

00:42:20,952 --> 00:42:22,420
I can't believe
that actually happened.

00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,421
(Jaiden, voice breaking)
The sharks actually

00:42:23,421 --> 00:42:25,222
treated us like adults,
and they valued our ideas.

00:42:25,222 --> 00:42:27,224
And it's great to see
someone else

00:42:27,224 --> 00:42:29,160
appreciate the smartwheel
as much as we do.

00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,162
(all) The inventioneers!

00:42:31,162 --> 00:42:34,098
(cheering)
