00:00:00,533 --> 00:00:02,067
(man) The sharks are back

00:00:02,067 --> 00:00:03,936
in an all-new season
of "Shark Tank,"

00:00:03,936 --> 00:00:06,539
where hopeful entrepreneurs
from across the country

00:00:06,539 --> 00:00:09,375
dream of a chance
to secure an investment

00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:11,377
and gain powerful partners...

00:00:11,377 --> 00:00:14,580
to start, grow,
or save their businesses.

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,450
We think we can take our sales
to $3 million.

00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:18,651
Whoa.
Whoa.

00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:20,386
If the sharks
hear a great idea,

00:00:20,386 --> 00:00:23,589
they're ready to invest
using their own money...

00:00:23,589 --> 00:00:26,358
I built a hundred-million-dollar
business in record time.

00:00:26,358 --> 00:00:29,767
And they'll fight each other
for a piece of the action.

00:00:29,767 --> 00:00:32,370
She's out of her mind.
I don't know
where he comes from,

00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:35,540
thinking that he knows
all about the retail world...
you can go
to a mass market with $90,000?

00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,100
Because he's not even in it.
You're crazy.

00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,636
But first, the entrepreneurs
must convince a shark

00:00:39,636 --> 00:00:42,405
to invest the full amount
they're asking for,

00:00:42,405 --> 00:00:43,540
or they'll walk away
with nothing.

00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,275
You didn't ask
for enough money!

00:00:45,275 --> 00:00:47,077
That's the problem!
That's it! I knew it.

00:00:47,077 --> 00:00:48,145
It's sink...

00:00:48,145 --> 00:00:49,346
Shucky ducky quack quack.

00:00:49,346 --> 00:00:50,747
Be nice.
Or swim.

00:00:50,747 --> 00:00:51,882
You have sharks
fighting for you.

00:00:51,882 --> 00:00:53,150
How is your order
better than Robert's?

00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,751
It's always better
when you have me.

00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:55,886
♪♪♪

00:00:55,886 --> 00:00:58,488
Who are the sharks?

00:00:58,488 --> 00:01:02,392
They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors

00:01:02,392 --> 00:01:04,594
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.

00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:08,098
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist

00:01:08,098 --> 00:01:11,902
who turned a $10,000 loan
into a software business

00:01:11,902 --> 00:01:16,473
worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:16,473 --> 00:01:18,809
Lori Greiner,
the queen of qvc,

00:01:18,809 --> 00:01:20,010
holds over a hundred patents

00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,412
and has launched
over 300 products,

00:01:22,412 --> 00:01:24,614
grossing over
a half a billion dollars

00:01:24,614 --> 00:01:26,216
in retail sales.

00:01:26,216 --> 00:01:29,286
Daymond John is a fashion mogul
and branding expert

00:01:29,286 --> 00:01:30,954
who grew
his homemade clothing line

00:01:30,954 --> 00:01:35,392
into the globally recognized
fashion brand Fubu.

00:01:35,392 --> 00:01:38,528
Robert Herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,

00:01:38,528 --> 00:01:40,130
is now a technology mogul

00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,898
who sold his first
internet companies

00:01:41,898 --> 00:01:45,769
for over $350 million.

00:01:45,769 --> 00:01:47,704
And Mark Cuban,

00:01:47,704 --> 00:01:50,607
notorious billionaire
entrepreneur

00:01:50,607 --> 00:02:02,219
and the outspoken owner
of the Dallas Mavericks.

00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:03,486
First into the tank

00:02:03,486 --> 00:02:05,488
are Brooke Bryant
and Brittany hayes,

00:02:05,488 --> 00:02:07,257
who are hoping
to elevate the decor

00:02:07,257 --> 00:02:09,326
of children's bedrooms.

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,968
Hey, y'all.

00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,503
We are
the Georgia peaches

00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,638
behind the next
multimillion-dollar

00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,708
children's decor company,
Addison's Wonderland.

00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,009
My name is Brittany Hayes.

00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:24,878
And my name is Brooke Bryant.

00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,947
We are seeking an investment
of $90,000

00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:30,550
in exchange for 20%
of our company.

00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,086
Addison's Wonderland
is the most unique,

00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,622
versatile, and exquisite
line of children's bedding

00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,157
on the market today--

00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,826
So much so
that when moms see it,

00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,328
they will never want
to buy ordinary again.

00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,931
When my sweet little Addison
was ready for her first bed,

00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:47,100
I started my search
for her big-girl room.

00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,170
And everything I found
had such Bland colors,

00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,372
lacked detail,
and most of the selection

00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,507
just was so plain,
it looked kind of cheap.

00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,042
So I got out my sketchbook

00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:57,477
and started working
on my vision

00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:59,546
of the ultimate
little girl's room.

00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:03,083
I got to work creating pillows,
window treatments, and bedding.

00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,151
Addison absolutely
loved her room,

00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:07,020
and so did everyone
who saw it.

00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,957
Brittany and I have been friends
for a really long time,

00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:13,460
and I've always believed in her
amazing creativity and design.

00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,328
So when she asked me
to partner with her,

00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,863
I didn't think twice.

00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,399
We are ready
to make Addison's Wonderland

00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,034
into a brand name
that everyone

00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,435
will want to have
for their child.

00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:24,237
So which of you
wants to team up

00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,506
with these motivated,
hardworking Southern gals

00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:31,544
and become the next
designer home decor empire?

00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,547
Ladies, no shark is
as fashion-forward as I am.

00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,548
(laughter)

00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,952
So is this sold
through retailers,

00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:39,753
or are you selling this
all direct online?

00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:42,021
Right now we are selling it
direct online.

00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:45,291
And you offer it
as a whole piece?

00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,526
On our web site,
we have what's called

00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:49,996
"Build your collection,"
where you can go through,

00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:50,530
and it easily kind of
navigates you through.

00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,532
If you wanna buy
the Addison collection,

00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,266
you know, you click
the duvet, pillows...

00:03:54,266 --> 00:03:55,299
Oh, I see.
And it'll kind of
show you.

00:03:55,299 --> 00:03:56,700
Or you can go
to each individual--

00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,768
like, the pillow section,
and order pillows.

00:03:58,768 --> 00:03:59,903
And what would this cost?

00:03:59,903 --> 00:04:02,105
A whole bedding set

00:04:02,105 --> 00:04:03,540
runs about $1,400
for a twin set.

00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,542
That's $1,400?

00:04:07,344 --> 00:04:09,612
Are you hand-sewing this
yourself at home?

00:04:09,612 --> 00:04:10,947
We have a small
custom workroom

00:04:10,947 --> 00:04:12,749
that does all
of our work locally,

00:04:12,749 --> 00:04:15,085
but that's one of
the reasons we're here,

00:04:15,085 --> 00:04:18,021
is to get better
manufacturing options.

00:04:18,021 --> 00:04:20,457
Yeah.
'cause that's very expensive
for a child's...

00:04:20,457 --> 00:04:21,458
that's another reason.
Bed.

00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:22,859
We would like to get
the price point down

00:04:22,859 --> 00:04:24,260
to a more reasonable rate.

00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,929
How long have you
been selling this again?

00:04:25,929 --> 00:04:27,364
Exactly a year.

00:04:27,364 --> 00:04:30,100
How's it been going?
Good.

00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,102
We've sold $130,000 so far.

00:04:32,102 --> 00:04:33,066
Wow.

00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:34,566
And what's your cost
on that $130,000?

00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:38,299
Our gross margin right now
is about 55%.

00:04:38,299 --> 00:04:41,099
And, Brittany,
what's the average order size?

00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:45,103
The average order size has been
between $800 and $1,200.

00:04:45,103 --> 00:04:47,039
Whoa.
(Lori) Whoa.

00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:48,100
How are people
finding your web site?

00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,236
We are just--Right now
mainly on social media.

00:04:51,236 --> 00:04:54,473
I posted some sneak peeks,
and it just took off.

00:04:54,473 --> 00:04:56,275
I mean, we got
hundreds of comments.

00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:57,409
And people were like,
"what date

00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:58,944
and what time
is this coming out?"
mm-hmm.

00:04:58,944 --> 00:05:04,717
That just seems
like so much money to me.

00:05:04,717 --> 00:05:07,853
It does to me, too.
So this is a very,
very high-End...

00:05:07,853 --> 00:05:09,361
Yes.
Exclusive product line?

00:05:09,361 --> 00:05:10,494
Yes. We would like
to get it down

00:05:10,494 --> 00:05:12,694
to a little bit less
of a high-End.

00:05:12,694 --> 00:05:14,630
If--if that's the market
you're catering to,

00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,698
and it seems to be
accepting that price point,

00:05:16,698 --> 00:05:18,700
why bring the price down?

00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,835
The feedback we've gotten

00:05:19,835 --> 00:05:21,170
is if it were
about 30% lower in price,

00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,238
we could reach a broader market.
We're kind of--

00:05:23,238 --> 00:05:25,574
Isn't the online strategy
a way to keep this

00:05:25,574 --> 00:05:28,410
so that you can fulfill
for everybody that wants it?

00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,947
I mean, maybe this isn't
destined to be a huge business.

00:05:31,947 --> 00:05:32,548
Maybe it's meant
to be a profitable one...

00:05:32,548 --> 00:05:34,316
right.
Where you just charge people

00:05:34,316 --> 00:05:36,385
outrageous prices
for this stuff.

00:05:36,385 --> 00:05:39,721
They won't survive that way.

00:05:39,721 --> 00:05:40,122
No, that's not true at all.
That's not True at all, Lori.

00:05:40,122 --> 00:05:43,759
Kevin, shockingly enough,
is--is right.

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,829
Um, you guys
are identifying a niche.

00:05:46,829 --> 00:05:47,229
Thousands of people
come to your site.

00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:49,631
You're selling to them.

00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:52,835
I don't agree with Mark.
I have always based my model

00:05:52,835 --> 00:05:55,237
off of making
great quality product

00:05:55,237 --> 00:05:57,039
at a great, affordable price

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,609
so that it can be enjoyed
by the masses.

00:06:00,609 --> 00:06:02,945
The good news is, your model
is not the only model.
And... Wait...

00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,746
there's lots of other ways
to make money.
Wait, wait, wait.
Mark, I was talking.

00:06:04,746 --> 00:06:05,694
Excuse me.

00:06:05,694 --> 00:06:10,061
I think that for you
to make a good profit,

00:06:10,061 --> 00:06:11,929
you're going to need
to hit the masses.

00:06:11,929 --> 00:06:13,197
That's really
the way to go.
You can't--

00:06:13,197 --> 00:06:15,933
Mark, there's a recession
going on.

00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:17,968
Most people--
They're struggling to just...

00:06:17,968 --> 00:06:20,771
$1,400 for a mortgage payment.
Well, I think--
we haven't done any--

00:06:20,771 --> 00:06:22,973
and they're saying
they wanna get their price down.

00:06:22,973 --> 00:06:25,509
She's out of her mind.
You're asking for $90,000.
I don't know
where he comes from

00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:27,133
thinking that he knows
all about the retail world...

00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:29,000
you can go into
a mass market with $90,000?

00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,266
Because he's not even in it.
You're crazy.

00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:33,800
Well, I think we would like to
go a little bit more wholesale.

00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,468
Like, we have
a lot of boutiques

00:06:35,468 --> 00:06:36,869
want to put it
in their storefront.

00:06:36,869 --> 00:06:39,633
Any specialty chains?
Bellini is one of them.

00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:43,537
I remember buying, uh, a crib
for my daughter in Bellini's.

00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:45,472
I think I'm just
paying it off now,

00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:47,340
and she's almost 18.

00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,609
(laughs)
Another reason we'd like
to get our cost down

00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,433
is so that we can
offer a wholesale rate.

00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:54,101
But that's a completely
different business

00:06:54,101 --> 00:06:55,867
than what you're in now.

00:06:55,867 --> 00:06:57,869
You've got end users
willing to pay crazy prices

00:06:57,869 --> 00:06:59,871
for colorful sheets
and pillows.

00:06:59,871 --> 00:07:03,608
Now you want to start servicing
a distribution business

00:07:03,608 --> 00:07:06,644
that wants at least
a 50% margin.

00:07:06,644 --> 00:07:09,380
Yeah, you may be trying
to grow too BIG too fast.

00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,982
You have a good business here.

00:07:10,982 --> 00:07:11,583
Yeah. I mean, that's what
we're trying to avoid.

00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,252
And that's why we're here,
to need your advice.

00:07:14,252 --> 00:07:14,886
'cause we feel like...
are you sure you're ready

00:07:14,886 --> 00:07:16,821
to bring in
a... a third voice?

00:07:16,821 --> 00:07:19,357
Yes.
Definitely.

00:07:19,357 --> 00:07:19,824
Just a little background
on me...
okay.

00:07:19,824 --> 00:07:21,826
So you know I'm not just,
like, a sew-at-Home mom--

00:07:21,826 --> 00:07:22,894
when I was in college,

00:07:22,894 --> 00:07:25,196
my husband and I
got married at 20,

00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:27,465
and he decided he wanted
to start a granite company.

00:07:27,465 --> 00:07:28,933
So I went in with him,

00:07:28,933 --> 00:07:31,202
we worked our...
booties off,

00:07:31,202 --> 00:07:33,071
and by the time
we were 23,

00:07:33,071 --> 00:07:34,272
we graduated from college,

00:07:34,272 --> 00:07:35,740
and the company was selling
$2 1/4 million.

00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,542
I know business.
I really do.
(Daymond) All right.

00:07:37,542 --> 00:07:39,744
We may be sweet
Southern girls, but...
Yeah, we can work hard.

00:07:39,744 --> 00:07:41,913
We're hard workers...
yes.

00:07:41,913 --> 00:07:43,114
And we're motivated
and passionate.

00:07:43,114 --> 00:07:43,648
What happened
to that business, Brittany?

00:07:43,648 --> 00:07:44,716
It's still in business.

00:07:44,716 --> 00:07:47,318
I-I... you know, I think--

00:07:47,318 --> 00:07:47,719
I think you're on
the right track.

00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:51,233
Your first year in,
you've done $130,000 in sales,

00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:53,168
and you're profitable.

00:07:53,168 --> 00:07:54,970
You know, in some ways,
you have the perfect business.

00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,339
Not sure I agree
with the strategy

00:07:57,339 --> 00:07:59,541
of going away from that.

00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:02,411
Not a market I understand.

00:08:02,411 --> 00:08:03,545
I'm out.

00:08:04,946 --> 00:08:08,467
I will say I-I love
your creativity,

00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:10,467
and I think
that you will go far.

00:08:10,467 --> 00:08:13,904
But I'm more
interested in products

00:08:13,904 --> 00:08:17,975
that, uh, can be affordable
by most of the population,

00:08:17,975 --> 00:08:20,911
as opposed to just a few.

00:08:20,911 --> 00:08:23,213
So for that reason,
I'm out.

00:08:25,549 --> 00:08:28,419
I really don't think
you need us.

00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:30,654
I think this is a business

00:08:30,654 --> 00:08:32,523
that you could run
out of your home,

00:08:32,523 --> 00:08:35,192
you can make
a couple hundred thousand,

00:08:35,192 --> 00:08:36,660
maybe even a million,

00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,462
and you can grow
the business like that.

00:08:38,462 --> 00:08:41,398
I wouldn't be of any assistance
to you. I'm out.

00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:45,069
Here's what
Mr. Wonderful says--

00:08:45,069 --> 00:08:48,639
There's nothing unique
or proprietary about it.

00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,375
You're wonderful Southern girls.
I get all that.

00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,844
But frankly,
if I wasn't so wonderful,

00:08:53,844 --> 00:08:55,746
and I wanted
to knock this off,

00:08:55,746 --> 00:08:57,014
I could do it
for a lot less.

00:08:57,014 --> 00:09:00,751
This is the brutal reality
of business.

00:09:00,751 --> 00:09:04,121
So I'm out.

00:09:04,121 --> 00:09:05,322
Mark? (chuckles)
(chuckles)

00:09:05,322 --> 00:09:06,924
As someone who's going through,
right now,

00:09:06,924 --> 00:09:10,661
redoing the rooms
for a 6-year-old

00:09:10,661 --> 00:09:12,529
and a 9-year-old daughter,

00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:15,532
I'm getting brutalized
with all this stuff, right?

00:09:15,532 --> 00:09:18,535
And so my wife would love it.

00:09:18,535 --> 00:09:21,972
And I recognize
that it's relatively expensive,

00:09:21,972 --> 00:09:25,309
but there's a market there
as well.

00:09:25,309 --> 00:09:29,279
But a lot of investors,
when they look at an investment,

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,749
they look at R.O.I.--
return on investment.

00:09:31,749 --> 00:09:34,952
I look at R.O.T., you know?
Return on my time.

00:09:34,952 --> 00:09:37,087
What are you gonna do, Mark?

00:09:40,991 --> 00:09:44,395
You know your daughters
would love this.
Yes, they would love it.

00:09:44,395 --> 00:09:46,196
(laughs)
You're gonna kill me.

00:09:46,196 --> 00:09:48,465
Um...

00:09:48,465 --> 00:09:51,869
I love the way these ladies
are pulling your heartstrings.
(women laugh)

00:09:51,869 --> 00:09:53,704
Just think--You could design
your daughter's room,

00:09:53,704 --> 00:09:56,173
on your own.
Go online...
yes. You could do this.

00:09:58,308 --> 00:09:59,910
I'm thinking.

00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:03,080
You're fine.
Take your time.
Evaluating.

00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,016
I mean, I like
what you guys are doing.

00:10:06,016 --> 00:10:08,485
If you were
half a million in sales

00:10:08,485 --> 00:10:10,320
or a million in sales,
then, you know,

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,189
then we could say, "Okay,
this is gonna result

00:10:12,189 --> 00:10:12,923
in me making
"X" Amount of dollars.

00:10:12,923 --> 00:10:16,727
It's just gotta
be worth my time.

00:10:16,727 --> 00:10:18,595
And I think
you guys don't need me.

00:10:18,595 --> 00:10:20,330
I think we do, though.
We--we do.

00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:23,133
Our sales have doubled
in the last six months.

00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:25,602
I think you guys
are gonna do wonderful things.

00:10:25,602 --> 00:10:27,337
I think you don't
have to rush it.

00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,242
I'm-a say I'm out.

00:10:32,242 --> 00:10:33,377
No.

00:10:33,377 --> 00:10:34,445
Shocking, but true.

00:10:34,445 --> 00:10:36,413
Yeah, I didn't
see that coming.

00:10:36,413 --> 00:10:37,881
Thank y'all so much
for your time...
Thank you so much.

00:10:37,881 --> 00:10:39,616
Thank you, guys.
And encouragement.

00:10:39,616 --> 00:10:40,951
(Lori) Good luck with everything.
You guys
will do very, very well.

00:10:40,951 --> 00:10:42,619
And if you need help
with your daughter's room...

00:10:42,619 --> 00:10:43,654
yes, call us.
I would be more than happy.

00:10:43,654 --> 00:10:44,721
Trust me, I'm taking notes,

00:10:44,721 --> 00:10:46,323
and I'm gonna give it
to my wife.

00:10:46,323 --> 00:10:47,658
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
All right. Thank y'all.

00:10:47,658 --> 00:10:48,659
Thank y'all.
Good luck.

00:10:51,128 --> 00:10:53,197
(Robert)
Who can afford $1,400?

00:10:53,197 --> 00:10:54,865
(Kevin) Apparently,
many people.

00:10:54,865 --> 00:10:57,468
At least $130,000
worth of people so far.

00:10:57,468 --> 00:10:59,136
Look, there's nothing wrong
with what they're doing,

00:10:59,136 --> 00:11:00,637
but that's never
gonna get big.

00:11:00,637 --> 00:11:02,306
It's crazy.
They'll be fine.

00:11:02,306 --> 00:11:04,975
Having the five sharks say
that we didn't need them

00:11:04,975 --> 00:11:07,311
was a little bit
of a disappointment.

00:11:07,311 --> 00:11:08,445
We definitely
wanted a deal.

00:11:08,445 --> 00:11:10,414
But it was actually
a great boost of confidence,

00:11:10,414 --> 00:11:13,283
'cause we know
that we can do it without them.

00:11:13,283 --> 00:11:14,633
♪♪♪

00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,367
Next into the tank
is Steve Maloney,

00:11:26,367 --> 00:11:29,637
with a game-changing
innovation for duck hunters.

00:11:29,637 --> 00:11:31,839
(duck call quacking)

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,841
(laughs)

00:11:35,075 --> 00:11:39,079
♪♪♪

00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:40,614
Hi. I'm Steve Maloney,

00:11:40,614 --> 00:11:42,616
president of Muddy Water Camo.

00:11:42,616 --> 00:11:45,452
And today,
we are seeking $150,000

00:11:45,452 --> 00:11:47,988
for a 5% equity
in our business.

00:11:47,988 --> 00:11:53,627
Sharks, we have created a new
process of making camouflage

00:11:53,627 --> 00:11:56,630
that's going to revolutionize
the hunting industry.

00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,832
The whole purpose of camouflage

00:11:58,832 --> 00:12:02,369
is to help the person wearing it
blend into the environment.

00:12:02,369 --> 00:12:04,371
Now Bubba over here

00:12:04,371 --> 00:12:07,474
is wearing a sample
of where camo started.

00:12:07,474 --> 00:12:09,944
Does that look like
the real outdoors to you?

00:12:09,944 --> 00:12:11,612
No.
Of course not.

00:12:11,612 --> 00:12:14,682
As an obsessed duck hunter,
I kept asking,

00:12:14,682 --> 00:12:18,452
"where's the camo that looks
like the places where I hunt?"

00:12:18,452 --> 00:12:20,721
after 30 years
of searching for camo

00:12:20,721 --> 00:12:24,959
that actually looked like
a real marsh,

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,095
I finally decided I'm just
gonna have to make it myself.

00:12:28,095 --> 00:12:31,098
(duck call quacking)

00:12:31,098 --> 00:12:33,634
(laughter)

00:12:33,634 --> 00:12:35,903
That's when he called me.

00:12:35,903 --> 00:12:37,571
Hee-Haw!
(Lori laughs)

00:12:37,571 --> 00:12:38,567
I'm Stephen Kirkpatrick.

00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:40,068
I've been a professional
wildlife photographer

00:12:40,068 --> 00:12:42,003
for over 30 years now.

00:12:42,003 --> 00:12:46,274
My profession demands
that I stay hidden.

00:12:46,274 --> 00:12:49,711
So I've been searching
for more realistic camo myself.

00:12:49,711 --> 00:12:53,115
So together, we set out
to create one.

00:12:53,115 --> 00:12:57,018
And now, five years later,
it's finally here.

00:12:57,018 --> 00:13:02,224
Introducing Muddy Water Camo.

00:13:02,224 --> 00:13:04,893
Here's me in muddy water.

00:13:04,893 --> 00:13:06,228
Where?
(Lori) Yeah.

00:13:06,228 --> 00:13:07,896
I'm-a have to help you out
here a little bit.

00:13:07,896 --> 00:13:11,766
Here I am...

00:13:11,766 --> 00:13:14,669
and here's Stephen.

00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,872
(Lori) Wow.
(Mark) Where'd you go, Waldo?

00:13:16,872 --> 00:13:18,607
(Stephen) Muddy water
is photographic camo.

00:13:18,607 --> 00:13:21,843
It is created outdoors,
where hunting happens,

00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:25,113
as opposed to indoors,
on some kind of computer screen.

00:13:25,113 --> 00:13:28,183
The entire pattern
is 100% in focus,

00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:31,153
and therefore 100% realistic,

00:13:31,153 --> 00:13:34,089
just as nature appears
to a bird's eye.

00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:37,893
We have found the way
to make camo real.

00:13:37,893 --> 00:13:40,428
Hey, and forget
the salt water.

00:13:40,428 --> 00:13:43,231
We're gonna put the sharks
in muddy water.

00:13:43,231 --> 00:13:46,668
(laughter, duck call quacks)

00:13:46,668 --> 00:13:49,538
(laughter)

00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:52,941
So, boys, are you basically
photographing a terrain,

00:13:52,941 --> 00:13:56,178
and then taking that image
and putting it onto cloth?

00:13:56,178 --> 00:13:57,712
Is that what's really
going on here?

00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:00,048
Basically, that's the way
we do it.

00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,884
It's about a 54-Step process,
believe it or not.

00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:04,085
Would anybody like a hat?
(Lori) Yes.

00:14:04,085 --> 00:14:06,221
(Robert) Oh, of course.
Sure, if it's free.

00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:07,689
Thank you.
Sure.

00:14:07,689 --> 00:14:08,690
Here's a hat, Daymond.
Thank you.

00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,958
Sure.
Thank you.

00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,293
Thank you.

00:14:11,293 --> 00:14:12,961
Let's go back
to why you're doing this.

00:14:12,961 --> 00:14:15,964
Let's assume a fact here.
Okay.

00:14:15,964 --> 00:14:17,098
Ducks are birds.
Right.

00:14:17,098 --> 00:14:18,967
They got bird brains.
(laughs)

00:14:18,967 --> 00:14:20,869
They fly over hunters
every day.

00:14:20,869 --> 00:14:23,205
They get blasted out of the sky.
That happens every day.

00:14:23,205 --> 00:14:25,740
Now are you saying
to me as an investor,

00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,276
"I can blast more ducks."
Right.

00:14:28,276 --> 00:14:32,447
"20% more ducks die
because of this technology"?

00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,115
it's gonna hide you better.

00:14:34,115 --> 00:14:39,154
Are you selling the technology
to camo companies,

00:14:39,154 --> 00:14:41,957
or are you actually
selling your own garments

00:14:41,957 --> 00:14:43,558
with your camo on it?

00:14:43,558 --> 00:14:46,161
We are selling both.

00:14:46,161 --> 00:14:47,162
Okay.

00:14:47,162 --> 00:14:49,030
What are your sales,
Steven, so far?

00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,833
So far this year,
they're $150,000.

00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:52,801
Your sales, total?

00:14:52,801 --> 00:14:54,402
Our--Our sales total
This year.

00:14:54,402 --> 00:14:56,204
Now, it--This is
a seasonal business,

00:14:56,204 --> 00:14:58,873
and we have not made it
to our first season yet.

00:14:58,873 --> 00:15:00,609
So I tell you,
you've done a very good job

00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:03,178
of camouflaging your valuation.
Well...

00:15:03,178 --> 00:15:06,114
(Lori laughs)
in fact, you've done such
a good job of camouflaging it,

00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,649
Kevin didn't pick up on it.

00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:08,917
They're not worth $3 million?

00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:10,218
Oh, you did catch that.

00:15:10,218 --> 00:15:11,419
I hadn't got
to that yet.

00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:13,555
How did you get

00:22:45,771 --> 00:22:47,640
And like we love
to say in Texas...

00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,543
(together)
Y'all want some of this.
(Daymond laughs)

00:22:50,543 --> 00:22:52,411
(laughs)

00:22:52,411 --> 00:22:53,412
Are you wearing them?

00:22:53,412 --> 00:22:54,413
Yes.
Yes.

00:22:54,413 --> 00:22:55,614
Because I just want to see

00:22:55,614 --> 00:23:00,252
why your jeans stop whale tail
and muffin top.

00:23:00,252 --> 00:23:02,788
Why is this different?
Just because it stretches?

00:23:02,788 --> 00:23:04,723
No, because usually,
waistbands are, like,

00:23:04,723 --> 00:23:07,193
more of a circular,
and ours is kind of an angle,

00:23:07,193 --> 00:23:09,728
so we have a little bit
more length back here,

00:23:09,728 --> 00:23:12,264
so that when you do bend down,
it's not gonna show everything.

00:23:12,264 --> 00:23:13,232
And then muffin top--

00:23:13,232 --> 00:23:15,701
What if--What if
you have a couple rolls?

00:23:15,701 --> 00:23:18,370
It's a really forgiving fabric.
It's really slimming.

00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,905
Do you have any sales?

00:23:19,905 --> 00:23:22,508
We do. We have
$12,000 worth of sales.

00:23:22,508 --> 00:23:23,676
Oh.

00:23:23,676 --> 00:23:25,611
Megan, there's gotta be a story.

00:23:25,611 --> 00:23:27,813
Why only $12,000?
Why are you here?

00:23:27,813 --> 00:23:30,449
Well, we--We originally
created a test.

00:23:30,449 --> 00:23:31,784
We did two years of research.

00:23:31,784 --> 00:23:33,853
Basically, we wanted
to meet the need in the market.

00:23:33,853 --> 00:23:35,855
So we met with boutiques
and said, "what's selling,

00:23:35,855 --> 00:23:38,257
and what are you lacking?"
and we designed for that,

00:23:38,257 --> 00:23:41,327
and we created
a premium product, meaning...
in 1 year, $12,000.

00:23:41,327 --> 00:23:42,461
Yes. Yes.
In 1 year, $12,000.

00:23:42,461 --> 00:23:43,529
Off of 300 pairs.

00:23:43,529 --> 00:23:45,831
So once Kevin gives you
the $150,000,

00:23:45,831 --> 00:23:48,567
tell me what the next
12 months are gonna look like.

00:23:48,567 --> 00:23:50,836
What we wanna do with the money
is drive sales.

00:23:50,836 --> 00:23:52,238
So we've got
to build a sales force.

00:23:52,238 --> 00:23:53,706
We have to develop
more product.

00:23:53,706 --> 00:23:57,076
We only created two styles,
so we need more styles.

00:23:57,076 --> 00:23:58,811
I don't wanna discount
the $12,000.

00:23:58,811 --> 00:24:01,480
But if you got the investment,

00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,049
what would the sales be
and how would you get them?

00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:05,384
So over the next 12 months,

00:24:05,384 --> 00:24:07,987
we're hoping to be
around $850,000 revenue.

00:24:07,987 --> 00:24:09,455
And how are you gonna do that?

00:24:09,455 --> 00:24:10,856
Through boutiques.
So, I mean,

00:24:10,856 --> 00:24:12,525
we'd love to do more P.R.,
marketing.

00:24:12,525 --> 00:24:14,393
The exposure we've had
so far in the last year,

00:24:14,393 --> 00:24:16,195
we haven't spent
one dime on it.

00:24:16,195 --> 00:24:17,930
How did those
300 units selling

00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:20,232
compare to other jeans?

00:24:20,232 --> 00:24:21,433
So at--at this boutique,

00:24:21,433 --> 00:24:23,569
they've got over
30 brands of jeans,

00:24:23,569 --> 00:24:26,639
and we were within
their top 25% Sellers.

00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:28,908
How much do these jeans
retail for?

00:24:28,908 --> 00:24:30,342
$187.

00:24:30,342 --> 00:24:33,612
And how much do you
sell it to the store for?
Wow.

00:24:33,612 --> 00:24:34,613
We sell for $80.

00:24:34,613 --> 00:24:35,981
And how much
do you make it for?

00:24:35,981 --> 00:24:37,116
$68.
It's $68.

00:24:37,116 --> 00:24:38,984
$68, and you sell it
for $80?
Mm-hmm.

00:24:38,984 --> 00:24:40,319
Because--
You are going to hell.

00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:42,187
Well, we...

00:24:42,187 --> 00:24:43,722
exactly.
We add the premium charge.
We wanted to flip
our profit margin

00:24:43,722 --> 00:24:45,858
by ordering bigger.
You're making no money.

00:24:45,858 --> 00:24:47,860
That's--That's why
we're here.
That's--Yeah.

00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,862
We want to place
a bigger order, so...

00:24:49,862 --> 00:24:51,997
so the cost...
I have to go
to hell with you?

00:24:51,997 --> 00:24:53,832
That's why you're here?
No, you're gonna go
on This great journey with us.

00:24:53,832 --> 00:24:55,568
It'll be so much fun.
We're gonna paint the town red.

00:24:55,568 --> 00:24:58,571
This is my space,
and most of the jean players

00:24:58,571 --> 00:25:01,640
are trying to bring
their jean price down to $120.

00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:05,878
Because the days
of $180, $220...

00:25:05,878 --> 00:25:07,079
it's--It's really over.

00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:09,114
Right now people can't pay
their mortgages.

00:25:09,114 --> 00:25:11,784
They're--they're wearing
that favorite pair of jeans

00:25:11,784 --> 00:25:12,851
forever now.

00:25:12,851 --> 00:25:14,720
Daymond, if I came to you,
and I said,

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,523
"Let's launch a denim brand.

00:25:17,523 --> 00:25:18,057
"Let's hire a designer,

00:25:18,057 --> 00:25:20,659
and I want to fund it.
Here's a check."

00:25:20,659 --> 00:25:23,062
You tell me what that check
has to be for

00:25:23,062 --> 00:25:28,500
for me to get 1% market share
in the next 5 years.

00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,435
To launch a denim line?

00:25:29,435 --> 00:25:31,170
$5 million.

00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:33,906
I'm in.
(laughter)

00:25:33,906 --> 00:25:35,674
You didn't ask
for enough money!

00:25:35,674 --> 00:25:38,143
That's the problem!
That's it! I knew it.

00:25:38,143 --> 00:25:42,247
(laughs)
Look, you're--You're
incredibly nice people.

00:25:42,247 --> 00:25:45,451
You've done a great job
with your presentation.

00:25:45,451 --> 00:25:47,510
What?!

00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,143
I just don't think
one store is enough.

00:25:50,143 --> 00:25:53,343
I'm out today.
Okay.

00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:54,977
Well, thank you.
Thank you.

00:25:54,977 --> 00:25:57,077
I think that you need
a lot of money,

00:25:57,077 --> 00:26:00,213
and I think it's really
too high a hill to tackle.

00:26:00,213 --> 00:26:03,250
But you're a designer.
Design something else.

00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,185
Do something
unique and different,

00:26:05,185 --> 00:26:06,787
where you don't have
a lot of competition.

00:26:06,787 --> 00:26:10,390
And then have something where
you're cornering the market,

00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:10,857
and people will back you,

00:26:10,857 --> 00:26:12,492
and you can
get out there quickly.

00:26:12,492 --> 00:26:15,228
So that's my recommendation.

00:26:15,228 --> 00:26:17,931
And I'm sorry. I'm out.
Thank you.

00:26:17,931 --> 00:26:20,934
If I were you, I would take
100, 200 pair of jeans,

00:26:20,934 --> 00:26:23,070
and because women
are obsessed with the fit,

00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:25,072
every single female star
in the world

00:26:25,072 --> 00:26:26,673
thinks they can be
a designer tomorrow,

00:26:26,673 --> 00:26:28,875
and they know nothing about it.

00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:32,613
You mail 200 pair of those
out to each individual person,

00:26:32,613 --> 00:26:34,648
and you tell them you want
to partner up with one of them,

00:26:34,648 --> 00:26:36,650
believe it or not,
one of them may say,

00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:38,919
"This is such
an incredible pair.

00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:40,854
Yes, I'll partner up
with you."

00:26:40,854 --> 00:26:43,523
And then you take that
to a... a shark,

00:26:43,523 --> 00:26:45,834
and they will die
to give you the money.

00:26:45,834 --> 00:26:48,503
It's just that simple.
Hmm.

00:26:48,503 --> 00:26:51,740
But today...

00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,140
I'm out.

00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:55,077
That hurt.

00:26:55,077 --> 00:26:57,813
So anybody else?

00:26:57,813 --> 00:26:58,947
If you can make
a woman's tushie

00:26:58,947 --> 00:27:02,284
look significantly better
than anybody else's,

00:27:02,284 --> 00:27:04,286
you're gonna be able
to build a following of people

00:27:04,286 --> 00:27:07,189
who will pay a premium, who are
waiting for your next product.

00:27:07,189 --> 00:27:08,857
It's gonna take longer,
it's gonna be slower,

00:27:08,857 --> 00:27:11,793
the margins won't be
as--As strong,

00:27:11,793 --> 00:27:13,018
but you can get there.

00:27:13,195 --> 00:27:15,397
I'm not the right person
to help you.

00:27:15,397 --> 00:27:17,966
But I'm telling you,
do not quit.

00:27:17,966 --> 00:27:19,533
It's not about spending
$5 million.

00:27:19,533 --> 00:27:20,934
It's just about
grinding it out and doing it.

00:27:20,934 --> 00:27:23,300
So I wish you guys
nothing but the best.

00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,301
I'm out.

00:27:24,301 --> 00:27:26,770
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,773
Mark is doing you
a huge disservice.

00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,041
No.

00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:31,508
Let me speak, Mark.

00:27:31,508 --> 00:27:35,646
Your probability of success
in this market is zero.

00:27:35,646 --> 00:27:39,216
So the more time you spend
pursuing this dream,

00:27:39,216 --> 00:27:41,218
the more you'll be wasting
your precious time.

00:27:41,218 --> 00:27:42,686
If you're truly entrepreneurs,

00:27:42,686 --> 00:27:45,489
go find something where
the probability of success

00:27:45,489 --> 00:27:47,491
is more than zero.

00:27:47,491 --> 00:27:52,596
No chance that you will get
share in the Jean business.

00:27:52,596 --> 00:27:54,798
I'm out.

Nobody goes out

and buys something
they've never heard of for $200

Hi, guys.

00:28:52,872 --> 00:28:54,807
Got a load
of, uh, ponderosa pine

from central Oregon.

00:28:56,066 --> 00:28:58,300

a family tradition

00:29:03,603 --> 00:29:04,938

00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,078
I'm Tanner...

00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:50,346
and I'm Taylor,

00:29:50,346 --> 00:29:53,549
and we're the Dame brothers
from Boise, Idaho.

00:29:53,549 --> 00:29:55,517
Our company is Proof eyewear.

00:29:55,517 --> 00:29:57,987
We are seeking an investment
of $150,000

00:29:57,987 --> 00:30:00,633
for a 10% share
in our innovative company.

00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:02,635
At Proof,
we create the most amazing

00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:04,604
one-of-a-kind
handcrafted eyewear

00:30:04,604 --> 00:30:07,700
from the most sustainable
woods available.

00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,536
As we have grown, we have added
other eco-friendly frames

00:30:10,536 --> 00:30:13,166
from materials such as
plant-based plastics

00:30:13,166 --> 00:30:15,034
and recycled
skateboard decks.

00:30:15,034 --> 00:30:17,904
I started Proof in my garage
a little over a year ago.

00:30:17,904 --> 00:30:18,438
As Proof started getting
more and more popular

00:30:18,438 --> 00:30:21,240
and started showing up
on famous people's faces

00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,309
and in International
publications around the world,

00:30:23,309 --> 00:30:25,244
it became more than I could
handle by myself,

00:30:25,244 --> 00:30:25,645
and I needed some help
in a major way,

00:30:25,645 --> 00:30:28,347
so I brought these two guys in
to help me out.

00:30:28,347 --> 00:30:29,882
For me, really,
it was a no-brainer,

00:30:29,882 --> 00:30:30,550
because, "a,"
I can trust them,

00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:33,086
I knew their work ethic.

00:30:33,086 --> 00:30:34,687
Heck, I used to give these guys
wedgies when they were little.

00:30:34,687 --> 00:30:38,024
(laughter)
And, "B," you know,
they work for cheap.

00:30:38,024 --> 00:30:40,326
So that's a win-win, right?

00:30:40,326 --> 00:30:41,313
In addition to that,
our family's been

00:30:41,313 --> 00:30:43,113
in the wood business
for a real long time.

00:30:43,113 --> 00:30:45,048
We like to joke that we have
sawdust in our veins.

00:30:45,048 --> 00:30:47,117
We bought each shark
their own personalized pair

00:30:47,117 --> 00:30:49,119
of proofs they can check out.

00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:51,000
We even engraved
with your names in 'em.

00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,001
Thank you.

00:30:52,001 --> 00:30:53,667
Thank you.

00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:55,567
Kevin, they've got,
uh, spring hinges,

00:30:55,567 --> 00:30:57,233
so they'll even fit
big heads like yours.

00:30:57,233 --> 00:30:59,702
(Robert) Let me see, Kevin.
Let's see.

00:30:59,702 --> 00:31:00,202
(laughs)
You look ridiculous.

00:31:00,202 --> 00:31:01,404
We got him
some green lenses, too.

00:31:01,404 --> 00:31:03,873
The color of money.
Daymond, let me see yours.

00:31:03,873 --> 00:31:04,940
Let's see.
Oh, yours are cool.

00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,075
Mark, you look ridiculous.
(laughs)

00:31:06,075 --> 00:31:07,276
He's ready
for a night on the town.
You guys are looking stylish.

00:31:07,276 --> 00:31:09,478
That's all I can say
right now.

00:31:09,478 --> 00:31:10,413
Please note the uniqueness
of the wood grain.

00:31:10,413 --> 00:31:12,433
No two trees
are exactly alike, right?

00:31:12,433 --> 00:31:14,502
Making no two pairs of Proofs
exactly alike.

00:31:14,502 --> 00:31:15,503
This makes your pair
a one-of-a-kind,

00:31:15,503 --> 00:31:17,738
handmade original.

00:31:17,738 --> 00:31:19,340
Over six decades ago,
our grandfather

00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:22,076
took his small Wood sawmill
from a one-man show

00:31:22,076 --> 00:31:24,078
to becoming
a very successful business.

00:31:24,078 --> 00:31:26,680
With his example
of hard work,

00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,816
dedication, and creativity,

00:31:28,816 --> 00:31:29,350
we're prepared
to take proof

00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,685
from three brothers
from Idaho

00:31:31,685 --> 00:31:34,054
to becoming a major success
in the eyewear industry.

00:31:34,054 --> 00:31:37,658
Entrepreneurs like us
don't grow on trees...
(Robert laughs)

00:31:37,658 --> 00:31:39,660
Even though the majority
of our products do.

00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,595
Speaking of things
that grow on trees,

00:31:41,595 --> 00:31:43,998
we need your money
to make this dream come true.

00:31:43,998 --> 00:31:46,033
Sharks, who's gonna become
part of the Proof family?

00:31:46,033 --> 00:31:48,436
Do you have any sales?

00:31:48,436 --> 00:31:49,603
Yeah, we've sold a little bit.

00:31:49,603 --> 00:31:50,070
Uh, in the last 12 months,

00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:53,407
we've had $433,000
worth of sales.

00:31:53,407 --> 00:31:54,809
Whoa.
Wow, that's good.

00:31:54,809 --> 00:31:56,477
Yeah, not bad.
You don't seem proud of that.

00:31:56,477 --> 00:31:58,279
We're very proud of that.
You know, it's, uh, it's...

00:31:58,279 --> 00:32:00,214
but you're kind of, like,
"Oh, Gee, shucks..."

00:32:00,214 --> 00:32:02,550
we gotta be humble.
We're from humble beginnings.

00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,618
We're from Idaho.
We're humble boys.

00:32:04,618 --> 00:32:05,219
But we work hard.
You should be proud of that.
How did you sell that?

00:32:05,219 --> 00:32:08,522
$433,000--
How did you sell that?

00:32:08,522 --> 00:32:10,257
Grassroots marketing.
Uh, we've gone to trade shows.

00:32:10,257 --> 00:32:13,194
And, uh, it really comes down to
the product really sells itself.

00:32:13,194 --> 00:32:16,464
What does it cost
to manufacture

00:32:16,464 --> 00:32:18,766
the case, the glasses,
the lens?

00:32:18,766 --> 00:32:19,233
What is your--your cost?

00:32:19,233 --> 00:32:24,271
The cost with the packaging
and the sunglasses is $14.

00:32:24,271 --> 00:32:25,206
What do you sell it
to a retailer for?

00:32:25,206 --> 00:32:28,876
Around $50 wholesale,

00:32:28,876 --> 00:32:30,878
and $100 retail.

00:32:30,878 --> 00:32:32,146
What celebrities and what
magazines did you get in?

00:32:32,146 --> 00:32:34,482
That's a great question.
It's a good question.

00:32:34,482 --> 00:32:37,351
We've been on, uh,
Snoop Dogg's face,

00:32:37,351 --> 00:32:39,253
Beyonce, Kelly Rowland...

00:32:39,253 --> 00:32:40,721
Shannon Brown.
And they endorsed them?

00:32:40,721 --> 00:32:42,590
We've gotten tweets--
We don't send the product out

00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,859
and say, like, "Hey, will you
wear these and endorse us?"

00:32:44,859 --> 00:32:46,460
you just saw them
wearing them?
It just happens.

00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,395
We've had a budget of zero
for our marketing,

00:32:48,395 --> 00:32:49,864
but we hustle a lot.

00:32:49,864 --> 00:32:51,031
Wood is extremely hot
right now.

00:32:51,031 --> 00:32:53,434
Crazy.
You're absolutely right.

00:32:53,434 --> 00:32:54,835
Everybody's doing chains,
they're doing watches.

00:32:54,835 --> 00:32:56,937
So you guys
are the official "Wood guys"?

00:32:56,937 --> 00:32:58,739
right?
We're the woodies, you know?
We're the wood brothers.

00:32:58,739 --> 00:33:01,208
There are other wood sunglasses.
I've seen them, right?
Oh. Plenty, yeah.

00:33:01,208 --> 00:33:02,543
What we've really
strived to do

00:33:02,543 --> 00:33:05,279
is really build a brand
around the product.

00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,680
Tanner, tell me about the logo.

00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,616
What's the significance?
How'd you come up with that?

00:33:08,616 --> 00:33:09,950
Really, when we started proof,

00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,720
we actually wanted to give back
in what we did,

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,456
and so we're working on building
an eye clinic in India.

00:33:15,456 --> 00:33:17,324
And so part of our sales
that we have,

00:33:17,324 --> 00:33:19,326
we--we donate
to this eye clinic in India.

00:33:19,326 --> 00:33:21,195
For us, the idea
behind the bird logo

00:33:21,195 --> 00:33:22,863
is everybody
has wings to fly.

00:33:22,863 --> 00:33:24,532
Sometimes they just need
a little help...
Oh.

00:33:24,532 --> 00:33:25,633
To catch flight.

00:33:25,633 --> 00:33:27,034
It's a great story.
It's nice.

00:33:27,034 --> 00:33:29,470
$433,000 last year.

00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:31,472
What do you think
your sales will be this year?

00:33:31,472 --> 00:33:34,742
I think we're gonna do about
$850,000 to $900,000 in sales.

00:33:34,742 --> 00:33:36,076
On the $433,000
that we've sold,

00:33:36,076 --> 00:33:38,345
$150,000 is profit.

00:33:38,345 --> 00:33:39,613
What we're doing, really,

00:33:39,613 --> 00:33:41,882
is putting a lot of the money
back into inventory.

00:33:41,882 --> 00:33:43,150
I mean, I'm not
taking a salary,

00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,552
and these two guys
are working--

00:33:44,552 --> 00:33:45,553
I mean,
they could make more money

00:33:45,553 --> 00:33:46,654
working at Mcdonald's, really.

00:33:46,654 --> 00:33:48,722
Is this your only job?
I have a full-Time job.

00:33:48,722 --> 00:33:49,723
I work in
our family's business,

00:33:49,723 --> 00:33:50,057
in the wood business
full-Time.

00:33:50,057 --> 00:33:53,994
You know, I've sold millions
of dollars of glasses.

00:33:53,994 --> 00:33:56,330
I don't know if you--if you're
aware of that or not.
We're big fans, yeah.

00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:59,567
And I'm partners with a large
company that makes sunglasses.

00:33:59,567 --> 00:34:02,236
And I'm afraid it's going
to be a conflict for me

00:34:02,236 --> 00:34:03,337
with that partnership.

00:34:03,337 --> 00:34:05,139
And as much
as I love you guys,

00:34:05,139 --> 00:34:06,674
I'm gonna have to be out.

00:34:06,674 --> 00:34:08,876
Okay.
Okay.

00:34:08,876 --> 00:34:10,277
Thanks, Lori.
What are you here looking for

00:34:10,277 --> 00:34:12,546
to get to that next
jump-off point?

00:34:12,546 --> 00:34:15,166
What we're really looking for
is money for inventory.

00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:17,368
We actually have
a small problem--

00:34:17,368 --> 00:34:19,170
I don't know if it's a problem.
It's an opportunity--

00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:21,567
Where one of
our biggest retailers

00:34:21,567 --> 00:34:23,667
has come to us,
and they wanna expand with us.

00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:24,800
We've gotta get
our inventory on point.

00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,135
Who's the retailer,
and what's the order?

00:34:26,135 --> 00:34:27,136
Pacific Sunwear.
Pacific Sunwear.

00:34:27,136 --> 00:34:28,337
Yeah, exactly.
Is the--

00:34:28,337 --> 00:34:30,072
we initially started,
um, in five stores.

00:34:30,072 --> 00:34:31,974
And within two weeks,
they got back to us,

00:34:31,974 --> 00:34:33,242
and said, "Hey,
we're gonna do ten."

00:34:33,242 --> 00:34:34,777
and then they just recently
got to us last week

00:34:34,777 --> 00:34:36,679
and said, "Hey, we need
to open--Open 50 stores

00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,014
for the holiday season."

00:34:38,014 --> 00:34:41,884
And that equates
to an order of over $200,000.

00:34:41,884 --> 00:34:43,152
Wow.
Wow.

00:34:43,152 --> 00:34:44,487
Yeah, but, guys, when
you're turning your sales

00:34:44,487 --> 00:34:46,155
at a relatively slow rate,

00:34:46,155 --> 00:34:47,823
you can slow down
your customers,

00:34:47,823 --> 00:34:49,558
which you've been able to do.

00:34:49,558 --> 00:34:51,494
But once it starts to sell,

00:34:51,494 --> 00:34:53,396
and there's other people
knocking on the door,

00:34:53,396 --> 00:34:56,265
and they're saying, "guys,
if you can't hit this order

00:34:56,265 --> 00:34:59,535
"for 150 pairs
for a thousand stores.

00:34:59,535 --> 00:35:01,670
I gotta take it
somewhere else"...
you got a problem.

00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,272
What are you gonna do?

00:35:03,272 --> 00:35:04,874
Maybe the answer to that is

00:35:04,874 --> 00:35:06,175
structuring a deal
with one of you

00:35:06,175 --> 00:35:08,110
where you say, "Okay,
you have--You have access

00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:10,146
to more capital if needed."
So what you're saying is,

00:35:10,146 --> 00:35:13,282
"come on, guys.
Give us more."
And free sunglasses for life.

00:35:13,282 --> 00:35:14,950
Free sunglasses for life.
And sunglasses for life?

00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:16,152
Yeah, but they're not
saying that, mark.

00:35:16,152 --> 00:35:17,553
You're saying that.
I love the sunglasses,

00:35:17,553 --> 00:35:19,288
but I'm out.

00:35:19,288 --> 00:35:20,289
Thanks, mark.

00:35:20,289 --> 00:35:22,291
If you went to general retail,

00:35:22,291 --> 00:35:25,628
like a Costco,
does that kill the brand today?

00:35:25,628 --> 00:35:27,463
I-I would say so.

00:35:27,463 --> 00:35:30,533
I mean, at the beginning,
we didn't wanna grow super fast.

00:35:30,533 --> 00:35:34,670
(Daymond) The good news is
that in a down economy,

00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,605
where apparel
and everything is horrible...

00:35:36,605 --> 00:35:38,007
Yeah.
Oh, for sure.

00:35:38,007 --> 00:35:40,109
You guys are actually getting
interest from Pacsun, right?

00:35:40,109 --> 00:35:41,977
Right.
So that's great.
You're cool.

00:35:41,977 --> 00:35:44,013
Thank you.
I've had a lot
of cool companies.

00:35:44,013 --> 00:35:45,548
Heatherette was
my most famous company

00:35:45,548 --> 00:35:47,283
that I've owned
that was really, really cool.

00:35:47,283 --> 00:35:50,820
But the problem is--was all
the cool brands are broke.

00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,155
Most people would say,

00:35:53,155 --> 00:35:55,224
"I don't wanna ever
be in Walmart."

00:35:55,224 --> 00:35:58,294
I'm dying to be in Walmart.

00:35:58,294 --> 00:36:01,263
Um, so we wouldn't have
the same vision.

00:36:01,263 --> 00:36:02,798
I wish you luck.
I'm out.

00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:06,001
Thanks, Daymond.
Thanks, Daymond.

00:36:06,001 --> 00:36:07,470
Wow. The cool, hip...

00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:10,272
Cool is not hip.
I thought you'd be
all over this.

00:36:10,272 --> 00:36:12,241
Cool and a profit
are two different things.

00:36:12,241 --> 00:36:14,176
I'm already cool and hip.
That's true.

00:36:14,176 --> 00:36:16,112
(laughter)
Well, here's something
I'll throw out at you--

00:36:16,112 --> 00:36:19,148
I'll give you the $150,000
for 25%.

00:36:19,148 --> 00:36:22,418
I want $2.50 per order...

00:36:22,418 --> 00:36:25,154
Hell, no!
Until I get my capital back.

00:36:25,154 --> 00:36:26,889
And then it drops to a dollar.

00:36:26,889 --> 00:36:28,824
Mr. Wonderful
is also the undertaker.

00:36:28,824 --> 00:36:30,826
I don't want
to fund inventory with equity.

00:36:30,826 --> 00:36:32,228
I want my equity because
I'm getting involved

00:36:32,228 --> 00:36:34,196
in a business I'm gonna
be with for a few years.

00:36:34,196 --> 00:36:36,465
That way, I get a constant,
you know, return of my capital.

00:36:36,465 --> 00:36:38,667
I'm a quarter-Partner
with you guys,

00:36:38,667 --> 00:36:39,735
and I've funded the business.

00:36:39,735 --> 00:36:40,870
All right,
so there's an offer--

00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:43,405
You get
the $150,000 today,

00:36:43,405 --> 00:36:45,007
that's gonna fill one order.

00:36:45,007 --> 00:36:47,776
When you wake up tomorrow,
what's the plan then?

00:36:47,776 --> 00:36:49,145
You gotta be very careful
about taking

00:36:49,145 --> 00:36:51,347
anything off the top
of your gross,

00:36:51,347 --> 00:36:53,149
and then paying it out
to somebody at this point.

00:36:53,149 --> 00:36:54,483
What is this,
"advice tank?"

00:36:54,483 --> 00:36:56,752
(laughter)
Or are you gonna
make 'em an offer?

00:36:56,752 --> 00:36:59,088
So I'll give you
the $150,000 for 25%.

00:36:59,088 --> 00:37:00,956
No royalty,
because that's ridiculous

00:37:00,956 --> 00:37:03,425
at this point in your company.

00:37:03,425 --> 00:37:06,795

Three sharks are out.

Kevin and Robert have each
offered the Dame brothers

00:37:20,176 --> 00:37:24,146
$150,000 for 25%
of their company.

00:37:24,146 --> 00:37:26,081
However, Kevin also
wants a royalty

00:37:26,081 --> 00:37:29,351
on each pair of glasses sold.

00:37:29,351 --> 00:37:31,353
Well, guys, you got
two offers on the table.

00:37:31,353 --> 00:37:32,488
Gotta make
a decision, guys.
Yeah.

00:37:32,488 --> 00:37:34,490
And you have sharks
fighting for you.

00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:37,226
Let me reiterate
the offers--
Let me--so it's $150,000

00:37:37,226 --> 00:37:39,094
for 25% from me.
I'll give you
$150,000 for 25%.

Robert's deal--
That's it.

00:37:40,796 --> 00:37:44,333
Mine--
I get $2.50 per order

00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:45,668
until my capital
is returned,

00:37:45,668 --> 00:37:47,736
then it drops to a dollar.

How is your order
better than Robert's?

00:37:49,405 --> 00:37:51,006
It's always better
when you have me.

00:37:51,006 --> 00:37:52,708
Difference
between Mr. O'Leary and I--

00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:55,244
I don't shuffle money around
on wall street

00:37:55,244 --> 00:37:56,612
and take a few bucks.

00:37:56,612 --> 00:37:59,148
I built a $100 million business
in record time.

00:37:59,148 --> 00:38:02,284
Mr. Wonderful knows
the life cycle of cash.

00:38:02,284 --> 00:38:04,153
We don't know what's gonna
happen to this thing.

00:38:04,153 --> 00:38:05,287
In my structure,

00:38:05,287 --> 00:38:08,757
I get my capital back
in about 14 months.

00:38:08,757 --> 00:38:10,867
I'm happy with that.
After that, I drop out...

00:38:10,867 --> 00:38:11,867
Look, guys, I'm not--I'm not
really worried

00:38:11,867 --> 00:38:13,367
about getting
my capital back today.

00:38:13,367 --> 00:38:15,102
Well, I always worry
about my capital.
I think a real investor

00:38:15,102 --> 00:38:17,037
worries about
growing the company.

00:38:17,037 --> 00:38:18,505
I know if you grow
the company,

00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:19,840
and we have
a successful company,

00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,709
we'll all get our money back.

00:38:21,709 --> 00:38:23,510
To--to put in
an investment at this point,

00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:26,480
and your primary reason
and worry is,

00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,749
"how do I get my few Pennies
back along the way?"

00:38:28,749 --> 00:38:30,918
I mean, that's ridiculous.
It's--That's ridiculous, too.

00:38:30,918 --> 00:38:32,252
You know, let me
tell you something...
(laughs)

00:38:32,252 --> 00:38:34,855
You guys should be taking some
off the table every month,

00:38:34,855 --> 00:38:37,124
because you don't know
what's gonna happen.
That's ridiculous!

00:38:37,124 --> 00:38:38,926
Why would you--
He doesn't understand
the cycle of cash.

00:38:38,926 --> 00:38:41,328
Look, I-I know
how to scale a business.

00:38:41,328 --> 00:38:42,930
I know how to grow it quickly.

00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:43,931
The more successful
you are,

00:38:43,931 --> 00:38:45,666
the more capital
you're gonna need.

00:38:45,666 --> 00:38:46,967
That's the challenge
of inventory-Based growth.

00:38:46,967 --> 00:38:47,968
Anyways, I've made you
an offer.

00:38:47,968 --> 00:38:49,436
What do you think
about it?

00:38:49,436 --> 00:38:50,504
We appreciate the offers,
and...

00:38:50,504 --> 00:38:52,106
Let us--Let us make
a phone call.

00:38:52,106 --> 00:38:53,774
All right.
And, uh...

00:38:53,774 --> 00:38:55,309
(Taylor) We'll be back.
We'll regroup here a second.

00:38:55,309 --> 00:38:56,643
Thanks.

00:39:00,414 --> 00:39:01,482
I really like them.

00:39:01,482 --> 00:39:03,584
They're gonna be
too cool for school.

00:39:03,584 --> 00:39:05,519
This is
a ride-the-wave business.

00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:06,854
Hey, pops. How we doing?

00:39:06,854 --> 00:39:08,722
Hey, Brooks, how are ya?

00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:09,990
Good I'm here
with Tanner and Taylor,

00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:12,059
and, uh, we've got
two offers on the table

00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:14,261
that we wanted to get--
Get your opinion on.

00:39:14,261 --> 00:39:15,529
Ah, great. Congratulations.

00:39:15,529 --> 00:39:16,997
Thanks.

00:39:16,997 --> 00:39:18,999
I think they're on to something.
I think this is a hot wave.

00:39:18,999 --> 00:39:21,635
You ride it for a while,
and you hope you figure it out.

00:39:21,635 --> 00:39:23,237
I would never do this deal

00:39:23,237 --> 00:39:25,038
without my capital
being returned, ever.

00:39:25,038 --> 00:39:27,241
Boy, what are
they gonna do?

00:39:27,241 --> 00:39:28,709
The advantage of taking on
a partner

00:39:28,709 --> 00:39:31,044
is the additional
working capital is good...
Mm-hmm.

00:39:31,044 --> 00:39:32,746
And the expertise is good.

00:39:32,746 --> 00:39:35,549
Obviously, the downside
is you dilute your ownership.

00:39:35,549 --> 00:39:36,517
Appreciate it, pops.
Love ya.

00:39:36,517 --> 00:39:38,118
We love you. Bye-Bye.

00:39:38,118 --> 00:39:39,119
See ya.

00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,988
All right, let's go.

00:39:45,859 --> 00:39:47,060
Well, we talked
to the old man.

00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,862
You know, he gave us
some good advice.

00:39:48,862 --> 00:39:50,130
Would either of you guys
be willing to--

00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:51,598
to up--up the amount?

00:39:53,634 --> 00:39:55,302
'cause, I mean, you're basically
valuating our company

00:39:55,302 --> 00:39:56,904
at $600,000.

00:39:56,904 --> 00:40:00,374
We got $433,000
of sales today.

00:40:00,374 --> 00:40:02,976
I think our company's worth
more than $600,000.

00:40:02,976 --> 00:40:04,978
Now you're getting smart.

00:40:04,978 --> 00:40:06,213
(Robert) Hallelujah.
Our grandpa
started with nothing.

00:40:06,213 --> 00:40:07,548
I mean, the guy
used to be a truck driver.

00:40:07,548 --> 00:40:08,949
He would mold wood,

00:40:08,949 --> 00:40:10,651
and then take it to California
on the weekend,

00:40:10,651 --> 00:40:12,519
and then flip back around
and mold wood all week,

00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:14,254
and then take it back down.
So he's just a hustler.

00:40:14,254 --> 00:40:15,722
He's about
building the business.

00:40:15,722 --> 00:40:17,658
Our dad is the C.E.O.
of the company today,

00:40:17,658 --> 00:40:20,661
and our--Our family
is about building business

00:40:20,661 --> 00:40:21,995
and supporting people.

00:40:21,995 --> 00:40:23,397
I mean, our family business,
we have...

00:40:23,397 --> 00:40:25,799
(voice breaking) 17...
1,700 people

00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:26,767
that... (laughs)

00:40:26,767 --> 00:40:29,036
1,700 people that we support.

00:40:29,036 --> 00:40:31,638
And so, you know, we started
out with three people,

00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:33,507
and we have seven people
in our business,

00:40:33,507 --> 00:40:36,844
and we wanna...
man, I don't know.

00:40:36,844 --> 00:40:39,680
We're about making, uh,
making this thing go.

00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,482
And we wanna build it
with a good partner

00:40:41,482 --> 00:40:44,718
that supports us and wants to
see this thing be successful.

00:40:44,718 --> 00:40:46,053
Make a counteroffer.

00:40:46,053 --> 00:40:48,322
That's why
it's called a "Shark Tank."

00:40:48,322 --> 00:40:50,524
Uh, Robert, would you
be willing to, uh,

00:40:50,524 --> 00:40:54,528
go to $200,000
for 20% equity in the company?

00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:56,797
I think that's
a fair valuation of our--

00:40:56,797 --> 00:40:58,599
of our company at this point.

00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:00,901
So you want him
to up his cash

00:41:00,901 --> 00:41:03,170
and reduce his ask?
Correct.

00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,172
And we'd also like
to kind of understand

00:41:05,172 --> 00:41:08,175
if you'd be willing
to help us going forward

00:41:08,175 --> 00:41:11,245
getting financing
if--If necessary.

00:41:11,245 --> 00:41:15,015
Well, uh, you've asked
for two concessions from me--

00:41:15,015 --> 00:41:17,117
more cash, less equity.

00:41:17,117 --> 00:41:19,052
Of course I'm gonna
help you find the funding.

00:41:19,052 --> 00:41:21,121
Of course I'm gonna help you
with advice.

00:41:21,121 --> 00:41:25,325
I'm gonna stick
to the $150,000 and 25%.

Could have helped
those guys.

No deal for either of us.
That's a tragedy.

Robert, they saved you

about doing the deal

You know, that's--That's flashy.
