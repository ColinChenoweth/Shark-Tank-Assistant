00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,501
(man) The sharks are back

00:00:02,501 --> 00:00:05,037
in an all-new season
of "Shark Tank,"

00:00:05,037 --> 00:00:07,440
where hopeful entrepreneurs
from across the country

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,976
dream of a chance
to secure an investment

00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:12,111
and gain powerful partners...

00:00:12,111 --> 00:00:15,248
to start, grow,
or save their businesses.

00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:17,049
If the sharks
hear a great idea,

00:00:17,049 --> 00:00:19,986
they're ready to invest
using their own money...

00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:23,189
what if I were
to give you $150,000

00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,523
and just buy you out?
Whoa.

00:00:24,523 --> 00:00:28,127
And they'll fight each other
for a piece of the action.

00:00:28,127 --> 00:00:29,595
You could make a lot,
a lot of money.

00:00:29,595 --> 00:00:32,131
I can buy you happiness.

00:00:32,131 --> 00:00:34,567
But first, the entrepreneurs
must convince a shark

00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:37,169
to invest the full amount
they're asking for,

00:00:37,169 --> 00:00:38,571
or they'll walk away
with nothing.

00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:40,773
This is a very serious
problem that happens.

00:00:40,773 --> 00:00:43,309
Why is the government
not all over this?

00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:43,709
It's sink...

00:00:43,709 --> 00:00:45,912
you think it's worth
a million dollars.

00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:47,847
Yes.
Not a chance in hell.

00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:48,514
Or swim.

00:00:48,514 --> 00:00:50,983
I can easily make you
millionaires.

00:00:50,983 --> 00:00:52,718
Mark, I think that was
the fastest deal

00:00:52,718 --> 00:00:53,986
we've ever done.
(laughs)

00:00:53,986 --> 00:00:55,121
Next?

00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:56,322
♪♪

00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:58,524
Who are the sharks?

00:00:58,524 --> 00:01:03,262
They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors

00:01:03,262 --> 00:01:04,864
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.

00:01:06,732 --> 00:01:08,901
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist

00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:12,171
who turned a $10,000 loan
into a software business

00:01:12,171 --> 00:01:16,509
worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:19,178
Lori Greiner,
the queen of qvc,

00:01:19,178 --> 00:01:20,646
holds over a hundred patents

00:01:20,646 --> 00:01:23,249
and has launched
over 300 products,

00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,850
grossing over
a half a billion dollars

00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,986
in retail sales.

00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:30,189
Daymond John is a fashion mogul
and branding expert

00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:32,458
Who grew
his homemade clothing line

00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:35,394
into the globally recognized
fashion brand fubu.

00:01:35,394 --> 00:01:38,731
Robert Herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,

00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:40,933
is now a technology mogul

00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:42,635
who sold his first
internet companies

00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:46,238
for over $350 million.

00:01:46,238 --> 00:01:48,107
And Mark Cuban,

00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:50,910
notorious billionaire
entrepreneur

00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,846
and the outspoken owner
of the Dallas Mavericks.

00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:06,792
(man) First into the tank

00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:08,527
are Jeffrey Simon
and Marc Newburger,

00:02:08,527 --> 00:02:11,063
with a business
to help make sure

00:02:11,063 --> 00:02:12,999
that nothing ever
slips through the cracks.

00:02:17,503 --> 00:02:19,038
Howdy, sharks,
I'm Marc Newburger...

00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:20,373
and I'm Jeffrey Simon,

00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:21,374
and our company is...

00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:23,109
(together) Drop stop!

00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:25,778
We're here today
seeking a $300,000 investment

00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:28,781
in exchange for
a 15% stake in our company.

00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:31,317
Now, sharks, let me
ask you a question--

00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,919
Have you ever dropped anything
down that gap

00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,921
between the seat
and center console in your car?

00:02:35,921 --> 00:02:37,189
You know what
I'm talking about--

00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:39,392
That black hole,
that dark abyss,

00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:41,127
the pit of doom.

00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,928
What we like to call
the car-muda triangle.

00:02:42,928 --> 00:02:46,265
(laughs)
That place that eats up
your cell phone,

00:02:46,265 --> 00:02:49,035
your keys, loose change,
parking and credit cards,

00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:52,838
and all sorts of food items,
like the French fry.

00:02:52,838 --> 00:02:53,439
Tell me.
How many of you have

00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,774
a 2-year-old
petrified French fry

00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:56,709
sittin' down in that gap?

00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:59,712
Who hasn't struggled, gotten
on their hands and knees,

00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,113
Butt up in the air,

00:03:01,113 --> 00:03:02,915
trying to retrieve
what just fell down there?

00:03:02,915 --> 00:03:05,384
Well today,
your crack problems are over...

00:03:05,384 --> 00:03:06,452
car seat crack, that is.

00:03:08,654 --> 00:03:10,523
Introducing drop stop--

00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:14,593
the first-of-Its-kind,
original patented safety device

00:03:14,593 --> 00:03:16,929
designed to once and for all
block that pesky,

00:03:16,929 --> 00:03:18,531
yet ever-so-dangerous gap

00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,100
between your car seat
and center console.

00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,569
Drop stop
reduces driver distraction

00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:26,839
by Keeping your eyes
on the road, not in your gap.

00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:30,042
Drop stop is universal
to fit any car or truck.

00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:32,311
The built-In slot is designed
to fit easily

00:03:32,311 --> 00:03:35,181
around the seat belt catch
like so...

00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:36,782
Which anchors it
to the seat...
(Robert laughs)

00:03:36,782 --> 00:03:38,717
So it can never
fall through to the floor.

00:03:38,717 --> 00:03:44,323
And wherever your seat goes,
drop stop follows.

00:03:44,323 --> 00:03:45,124
The stretchy,
durable material

00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:48,194
is designed to last the life
of your vehicle and beyond,

00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:50,196
and drop Stop's squishy center

00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:54,066
allows it to expand or contract
to fit any size gap.

00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:57,770
You won't even know
it's there...

00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,904
till it stops the drop.

00:03:58,904 --> 00:04:01,574
So, sharks, we can make
a lot of money together.

00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,710
But we can also save
a lot of lives together.

00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,712
So we're asking y'all
just this once

00:04:06,712 --> 00:04:08,781
to lay down your dorsal fins

00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:11,317
and join us to make
dropping and driving...

00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:12,785
(together)
a thing of the past.

00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:14,386
(laughs)

00:04:14,386 --> 00:04:16,388
How much money is there

00:04:16,388 --> 00:04:19,391
in solving
the car-Muda triangle problem?

00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:23,996
We have actually sold
over 260,000 units.

00:04:24,396 --> 00:04:26,532
You've sold 260,000 units?

00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:27,500
Yes.
Yes.

00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,102
130,000 sets,
or 260,000 units.

00:04:30,102 --> 00:04:33,305
How many dollars
did that equate to?

00:04:33,305 --> 00:04:35,241
Uh, we have had gross sales,

00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:38,043
since we opened our doors
in 2009, of $1.3 million.

00:04:40,846 --> 00:04:41,647
This year,
how much will you do?

00:04:41,647 --> 00:04:44,850
This year, we have made
$300,000 in gross sales,

00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,052
and we have net $50,000.
For the fourth quarter,

00:04:47,052 --> 00:04:48,587
which is one of
our biggest times of the year,

00:04:48,587 --> 00:04:50,923
we have commitments
and things are in the works

00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:53,792
to actually gross $500,000.

00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:58,330
And from that, we will be making
$260,000 net income.

00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,366
What is your mode of selling?
Where are you selling this?

00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:03,569
We sell on our web site,
we sell through the catalogs,

00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:04,970
and, Marc, where's
the other big one

00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,238
we've been working on?

00:05:06,238 --> 00:05:08,374
Well, we've actually had
42 shows on qvc.

00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:10,376
And I'm speaking to
the queen herself right here.

00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:13,112
And we--
42 times
it's been on qvc?

00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:16,048
Yes. We just
had two shows last week,

00:05:16,048 --> 00:05:16,582
in fact, we had
one scheduled for today...
today.

00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:19,185
That we had to skip,
unfortunately, because--

00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,453
This is much cooler
than qvc.

00:05:21,453 --> 00:05:23,455
We love qvc. We love qvc.

00:05:23,455 --> 00:05:24,790
That's right.
Everybody loves qvc.

00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,059
(laughs)
Can we see 'em, guys?

00:05:27,059 --> 00:05:28,394
Yeah.
Absolutely. Marc,
please give it to them.

00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:30,196
With the packaging.
Yeah, with the packaging.

00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:32,665
Are people that big slobs

00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,234
that they're dropping stuff
in their car all the time?

00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:36,769
Have you never dropped
anything down that gap before?

00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,837
Even just could be
your phone, your keys.

00:05:38,837 --> 00:05:39,972
I mean, everybody says,

00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,640
"why didn't
I think of this idea?"

00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,575
or, "god,
this happened to me."
Really?

00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:44,977
This is a very serious
problem that happens.

00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:45,711
The United States
department of transportation

00:05:45,711 --> 00:05:48,714
said There are
over 500,000 accidents

00:05:48,714 --> 00:05:50,249
and over 5,000 fatalities
that happen

00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:51,584
from driver distraction
alone.

00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:52,785
And, Marc,
why don't you share

00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:54,186
how we actually
came up with the idea,

00:05:54,186 --> 00:05:54,720
and I think that'll help...
okay.

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,522
You know.

00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,325
About four and a half years ago,
we both live in Los Angeles,

00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:00,593
I was driving
on sunset boulevard,

00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:02,795
and my phone was just
sitting on the center console.

00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:04,730
And when it rang, it shimmied
off and fell down the gap,

00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,665
and I went to go
reach for it really quick,

00:06:06,665 --> 00:06:08,067
and I tugged
the wheel to the right.

00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,301
I looked up,

00:06:09,301 --> 00:06:10,636
all four tires went up
onto the sidewalk,

00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:11,837
I literally saw a guy

00:06:11,837 --> 00:06:13,239
superman-leap
3 feet out of the way--

00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:13,772
I would have killed him--

00:06:13,772 --> 00:06:16,041
And I missed hitting
a telephone pole by an inch.

00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,443
Wow.
And I just
started screaming,

00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:19,712
"why doesn't somebody
come up with a way

00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,914
to block this stupid crack?!"
there has to be a better way!

00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:24,316
(laughs)
I agree!

00:06:24,316 --> 00:06:26,719
What's it cost to make these,
and what do you sell 'em for?

00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,187
Our cost to us is $4.

00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:29,521
For one or two?

00:06:29,521 --> 00:06:30,522
For a set of two.
For two.

00:06:30,522 --> 00:06:32,057
$2 apiece.
$2 apiece.

00:06:32,057 --> 00:06:33,259
And for retail,
it sells for $19.99.

00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,727
So we're talking about
a markup of $5,

00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,396
which we know is a very
attractive number to investors.

00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:39,932
And you have to sell it
to retailers for $10.

00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:41,834
Right.
Hold on.
I'm not there yet,

00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,302
but I will get to that.
(Lori laughs)

00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:45,971
Obviously, retailers
want a 50% markup.

00:06:45,971 --> 00:06:47,106
So we sell it for $10.

00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:48,707
We're making a gross profit
of $6.

00:06:48,707 --> 00:06:51,844
Retail is the next big game,
which is why we're really here.

00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:54,246
Do you have
intellectual property?
We have a patent.

00:06:54,246 --> 00:06:55,914
(Lori) a utility patent.
A utility patent.

00:06:55,914 --> 00:06:57,850
On?
On the actual product,
drop stop.

00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,786
On putting stuff between a seat
and a center console?

00:07:00,786 --> 00:07:03,055
An elongated member

00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:05,324
with--With a slot that goes
around the seat belt catch.
(laughing)

00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:06,725
We--We own that area, baby.

00:07:06,725 --> 00:07:09,862
And--And there have been...
you are a sick puppy.

00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:10,729
(laughs)

00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:14,099
I can't believe people
are dropping that much stuff.

00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:16,635
Like, it never happens to me.

00:07:16,635 --> 00:07:18,971
Robert, just go out there
and look in my car.

00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,706
(laughs)
(laughs) Thank you.

00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:21,974
I'm not a believer
in the product.

00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:24,109
I'm not the right investor.
I'm out.

00:07:24,109 --> 00:07:26,445
Thank you, anyway.
Respectfully,
we understand that.

00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:29,248
Thank you.
You know,
I-I like the story.

00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:30,249
I think you guys
are making money.

00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:31,583
I mean, where I'm from,

00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,252
that--That space
is really, really special.

00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:35,187
Because when somebody
pulls you over,

00:07:35,187 --> 00:07:36,789
you can get three to five
on rikers island

00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,124
if you don't have that space
to drop something down there.

00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:42,594
(laughter)

00:07:42,594 --> 00:07:44,596
Thankfully,
that hasn't happened yet.

00:07:44,596 --> 00:07:47,199
I'm not saying that I ever
did anything like that.

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,969
Um, the--the sales are
showing that it's a need,

00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:54,840
but it's not something
that I believe in.

00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,308
I'm out.

00:07:56,308 --> 00:07:59,978
Thank you.

00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:00,512
Guys, I think
it's a phenomenal product.

00:08:00,512 --> 00:08:02,848
I'm gonna take
the one you gave me,

00:08:02,848 --> 00:08:04,316
and I'm gonna use it,
you know?

00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:05,384
Because I'm--I'm a slob.

00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:06,919
(laughs)

00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:10,189
But being a slob, and being
a customer for the product

00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,123
is different than being
the right person

00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:12,591
to help you sell it.

00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:14,526
You know, you've
already got qvc,

00:08:14,526 --> 00:08:16,395
and Lori's
the right person for that.

00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:19,264
So if I could
add value, I would,

00:08:19,264 --> 00:08:21,567
but, guys,
I have to say I'm out.

00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:22,568
Okay.

00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:25,104
That's a bummer.
Bummer.

00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:26,972
For me,
this isn't just a product.

00:08:26,972 --> 00:08:28,374
It's a dream.
It is a calling.

00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:29,975
If you can just
save someone's life once,

00:08:29,975 --> 00:08:32,378
it's worth it.

00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:34,913
I see the value, guys.
I really, really do.

00:08:34,913 --> 00:08:38,117
Um, but it takes
a commitment to do it right.

00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:40,452
I would be nothing more
than a checkbook to you guys,

00:08:40,452 --> 00:08:42,921
and you guys are asking
for more than that.

00:08:42,921 --> 00:08:46,125
Absolutely, and thank you
for being honest.
Yeah.

00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,194
I like being a checkbook.

00:08:49,194 --> 00:08:49,728
(both laugh)

00:08:49,728 --> 00:08:51,663
I like to hear that.
Yeah.

00:08:51,663 --> 00:08:53,265
You know, I think
the problem with this deal

00:08:53,265 --> 00:08:56,301
is it's not really a company.
It's a product.

00:08:56,301 --> 00:08:59,104
Right now what it does is,
it uses capital.

00:08:59,104 --> 00:09:01,974
The bigger it grows,
it just sucks cash.

00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:04,243
The bigger you get,
the more distribution you get,

00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,778
the more money
you're gonna need.

00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:07,446
Now for the investor,
Mr. Checkbook here--

00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:10,716
Mr. Wonderful checkbook,
you can call me that--

00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:11,984
I look at it
and say to myself,

00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,452
"okay, I'll give you
$300,000."

00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:17,189
You know, and right now that
money is hanging onto my leg,

00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:18,457
it's saying,
"daddy, where am I going?"

00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:21,193
I say, "nowhere yet.
I'm thinking about it.

00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,261
You may go
to summer camp now."

00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:24,663
It says, "no, daddy, no!
I wanna make sure I come home."
(laughs)

00:09:24,663 --> 00:09:26,799
And so I'm thinking
to myself,

00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,234
before I send
these little soldiers off,

00:09:29,234 --> 00:09:29,902
I gotta figure out a way

00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,703
that they come home
with more friends.

00:09:31,703 --> 00:09:33,705
The idea is
send the dollars out,

00:09:33,705 --> 00:09:36,041
they capture some,
they come back to daddy.

00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:39,378
That's how it works.
So I give you the $300,000,

00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,647
I don't want
any equity in your company.

00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,382
But what I want is,
every time you sell

00:09:46,518 --> 00:09:48,387
I get $2 back.

00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,191

end up leaving us

00:15:25,263 --> 00:15:27,332
the extent
of the lionfish spread

00:15:27,332 --> 00:15:28,867
over the past 20 years.

00:15:28,867 --> 00:15:32,738
You see, the lionfish,
because of its venomous spines,

00:15:32,738 --> 00:15:35,007
has no natural predator.

00:15:35,007 --> 00:15:38,577
And already, it is
the second most populous fish

00:15:38,577 --> 00:15:41,179
in the western atlantic
and the caribbean.

00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:43,782
And it eats
just about anything.

00:15:43,782 --> 00:15:45,717
Right,
including valuable species,

00:15:45,717 --> 00:15:48,654
like snapper, grouper, lobster,
shrimp, and crab,

00:15:48,654 --> 00:15:52,591
that thousands of fisheries
and millions of people

00:15:52,591 --> 00:15:53,925
depend on for survival.

00:15:53,925 --> 00:15:55,794
And it gets worse.

00:15:55,794 --> 00:15:56,595
Now they also feast on fish

00:15:56,595 --> 00:16:01,133
that are crucial to keeping
Coral reefs alive.

00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:02,801
Our oceans
are already in crisis.

00:16:02,801 --> 00:16:05,270
And the lionfish
could be the straw

00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,539
that breaks the camel's back.

00:16:07,539 --> 00:16:09,508
But, sharks, we have
a solution to this problem.

00:16:09,508 --> 00:16:11,843
Mm-hmm.

00:16:13,845 --> 00:16:16,048
(together) to beat 'em,
just eat 'em.

00:16:16,048 --> 00:16:19,117
Oh, chef Jeffrey?
Would you come out here, please?
(laughs) Oh, no.

00:16:19,117 --> 00:16:20,652
The sharks are feeding.

00:16:20,652 --> 00:16:22,320
Oh...
no.

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,388
No.

00:16:23,388 --> 00:16:25,590
That's right, folks.

00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:29,461
Today we are serving lionfish.

00:16:29,461 --> 00:16:32,130
It's delicious, nutritious,

00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,466
and perfectly safe to eat,
I assure you.

00:16:34,466 --> 00:16:36,735
What would you liken it to?

00:16:36,735 --> 00:16:38,070
What type of fish,
the way it tastes?

00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:41,339
I would say it's similar
to snapper or grouper.
Chicken.

00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:42,340
Chicken? (laughs)

00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,308
So you are selling it?

00:16:43,308 --> 00:16:45,043
Oh, absolutely, yeah.

00:16:45,043 --> 00:16:46,178
And what do you call it
when you sell it?

00:16:46,178 --> 00:16:49,448
We call it lionfish.

00:16:49,448 --> 00:16:53,051
Why? Like sea Bass wasn't
originally called sea Bass.

00:16:53,051 --> 00:16:54,920
It had some nasty name
for whatever...

00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,588
patagonian toothfish.

00:16:56,588 --> 00:16:58,256
Yeah,
the patagonian toothfish.

00:16:58,256 --> 00:16:59,391
There you go. Right.
Right. Right. Yeah.

00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,993
Sea Bass sure sounds
a whole lot better.

00:17:01,993 --> 00:17:03,528
Well, you're right, mark.

00:17:03,528 --> 00:17:05,130
In that regard,
it does sound better.

00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,065
But on the other hand, uh,

00:17:07,065 --> 00:17:10,469
we're promoting this as
an opportunity for people

00:17:10,469 --> 00:17:13,205
to help the ecology
by consuming the fish.

00:17:13,205 --> 00:17:16,575
So that's why we wanted
to keep the name lionfish.

00:17:16,575 --> 00:17:18,910
But, mark, if you
wanna give us money,

00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,178
we'll call it
anything you want.

00:17:20,178 --> 00:17:22,047
We'll--We'll call it
the cubanfish.

00:17:22,047 --> 00:17:25,050
(laughs) It tastes good.
I mean, do you guys like it?

00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:27,452
Yeah.
Yeah, I mean,
it tastes like, uh...

00:17:27,452 --> 00:17:28,987
flounder.

00:17:28,987 --> 00:17:30,655
Delicious.

00:17:30,655 --> 00:17:34,126
I'm familiar with
the lionfish from aquariums.

00:17:34,126 --> 00:17:35,994
'cause it's
a very beautiful fish.

00:17:35,994 --> 00:17:37,596
Until you told me today

00:17:37,596 --> 00:17:41,733
that it's a danger
to all the other fish,

00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:42,934
I never realized that.

00:17:42,934 --> 00:17:45,403
(Mark) Yeah.
The fact that it has
no predators.

00:17:45,403 --> 00:17:47,539
It's proliferating
in the caribbean,

00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:49,374
and there's just
no stopping that.

00:17:49,374 --> 00:17:51,910
And you're saying that's bad
for the underwater environment?

00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,979
It eats snapper.
It eats the herbivorous fish.

00:17:53,979 --> 00:17:56,248
How does that little guy
eat a lobster?

00:17:56,248 --> 00:17:58,250
Lobster larvae.
Lobster larvae.

00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,652
But doesn't every fish
eat lobster larvae?

00:18:00,652 --> 00:18:01,186
It sounds like a delicacy.

00:18:01,186 --> 00:18:04,055
Yeah, it does sound
like a--
Yeah.

00:18:04,055 --> 00:18:05,390
I would guess that
every fish does, but--

00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,926
So aren't we being
a little negative on this guy?

00:18:07,926 --> 00:18:09,327
(mark laughs)
No, we're not.
Trust me, Kevin.

00:18:09,327 --> 00:18:11,129
But I'm amazed that this
is so delicious.

00:18:11,129 --> 00:18:13,131
I'm-a go home to my fish tank

00:18:13,131 --> 00:18:15,667
and Lemon and tartar up,
uh... ol' skippy.
(laughter)

00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:17,669
But let me ask you
something.
Yeah, sure.

00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:21,006
If they taste that delicious,
why haven't anybody else

00:18:21,006 --> 00:18:23,642
harvested this, uh,
fish out of the sea?

00:18:23,642 --> 00:18:25,243
It's very labor intensive.
It's taken us a long time

00:18:25,243 --> 00:18:27,979
and it's cost us
a lot of money.

00:18:27,979 --> 00:18:29,314
What's the process
of catching them?

00:18:29,314 --> 00:18:30,582
They don't bite on a hook,

00:18:30,582 --> 00:18:33,185
and they live in caves
of the reef.
Of the reefs, yeah.

00:18:33,185 --> 00:18:36,254
So you can't net them.
So they're only speared.

00:18:36,254 --> 00:18:38,790
And we deal with, uh,
mexican spearing cooperatives.

00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:42,194
How can you scale it if you
have to Spear each one of 'em?

00:18:42,194 --> 00:18:44,863
There's a surprising number
of, uh,

00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,464
Spear fishing cooperatives
in the caribbean.

00:18:46,464 --> 00:18:50,068
So how does the cost
of the fish per pound

00:18:50,068 --> 00:18:50,869
compare to other fish,

00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:53,138
like sea Bass or Trout
or whatever?

00:18:53,138 --> 00:18:55,373
It would comparable
to probably sea Bass,

00:18:55,373 --> 00:18:57,843
grouper, uh, snapper.

00:18:57,843 --> 00:18:59,644
So there's not really
a cost element here?

00:18:59,644 --> 00:19:01,112
So you've really gotta
like the taste

00:19:01,112 --> 00:19:02,914
and be willing to choose it

00:19:02,914 --> 00:19:04,983
and possibly be willing
to choose your dinner

00:19:04,983 --> 00:19:07,786
based off of some
ecological factors?

00:19:07,786 --> 00:19:09,988
That and the taste.
I mean...

00:19:09,988 --> 00:19:12,791
how does the consumer know
they should eat this?

00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:16,127
Well, that's been a challenge,
because we essentially

00:19:16,127 --> 00:19:19,865
are introducing a new fish
into the U.S. Market.

00:19:19,865 --> 00:19:22,267
But, Dave, if this is
such a problem,

00:19:22,267 --> 00:19:23,735
why is the government
not all over this?

00:19:23,735 --> 00:19:26,538
I've never seen anything
of this danger.

00:19:26,538 --> 00:19:29,040
You're telling me
that the reefs are gonna die.

00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,309
Robert, I honestly think
the problem is

00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:32,244
a lack of funding right now

00:19:32,244 --> 00:19:34,579
because so many programs
have been cut.

00:19:34,579 --> 00:19:35,981
At least that's what
we're hearing

00:19:35,981 --> 00:19:38,049
from the people that we talk to
in the government.

00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:39,784
So let's go to the business
side of it.

00:19:39,784 --> 00:19:43,054
How much fish have you sold
in the last year?

00:19:43,054 --> 00:19:47,525
Um, we've grossed $12,000.

00:19:47,525 --> 00:19:48,793
Sales?

00:19:48,793 --> 00:19:50,061
Yes.
Sales.

00:19:50,061 --> 00:19:50,929
Boy, is that ever small.

00:19:52,797 --> 00:19:56,601
Let me tell you where I stand.
I think you have a tremendous

00:19:56,601 --> 00:20:00,538
market acceptance problem
ahead of you.

00:20:00,538 --> 00:20:04,843
You did a good job of explaining
the problem, but...
Mm-hmm.

00:20:04,843 --> 00:20:08,179
I don't care how much supply
you have if there's no demand.

00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:11,182
I'm out.
All right. Well, thanks
for your time, Robert.

00:20:11,182 --> 00:20:14,519
So, on cape cod
at the turn of the century,

00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:17,322
the lobster was considered
the cockroach of the sea.

00:20:17,322 --> 00:20:18,990
Mm.
Nobody would eat it.

00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:21,326
That's why they fed it
to prisoners.

00:20:21,326 --> 00:20:24,529
It took 40 years
to convince Boston society

00:20:24,529 --> 00:20:26,665
that that cockroach
was a delicacy,

00:20:26,665 --> 00:20:28,800
and now it trades
for, you know,

00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,870
$15 a pound sometimes
in restaurants.

00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,538
40 years is a long time.

00:20:33,538 --> 00:20:35,507
Now, that little cockroach
May take just as long

00:20:35,507 --> 00:20:39,110
to convince people to eat it.

00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:42,781
You'll both be dead
before that's mainstream.

00:20:42,781 --> 00:20:44,115
I won't be,
'cause I'm a vampire.

00:20:44,115 --> 00:20:46,918
(laughter)
But in the meantime, I'm out.

00:20:46,918 --> 00:20:49,587
All right. Thanks for your time,
Kevin. Appreciate it.

00:20:51,056 --> 00:20:53,792
Guys, I think this is
just gonna be a huge

00:20:53,792 --> 00:20:57,195
educational challenge,
and, uh,

00:20:57,195 --> 00:20:59,798
$225,000 is just not
gonna do it.

00:20:59,798 --> 00:21:01,399
I'm out.
Thank you.

00:21:01,399 --> 00:21:03,935
All right, thanks, daymond.

00:21:03,935 --> 00:21:05,070
It is a good problem
to solve.

00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,405
It is
a high leverage problem,

00:21:07,405 --> 00:21:08,907
meaning that if you can
solve it,

00:21:08,907 --> 00:21:12,444
you can make a lot,
a lot, a lot of money.

00:21:12,444 --> 00:21:16,314
But your catch-22 is
it's gonna take a lot of money.

00:21:16,314 --> 00:21:19,985
You really haven't asked
for enough to solve a problem.

00:21:19,985 --> 00:21:21,386
You haven't said, "look,

00:21:21,386 --> 00:21:24,122
"This is how we're gonna
market it

00:21:24,122 --> 00:21:27,125
just to one community
to--to find the demand."

00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,460
So I'm out.

00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,930
Thanks.
Thank you, mark.

00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,466
I'm for anything that helps
the ecology,

00:21:34,466 --> 00:21:38,069
and I hope that some kind
of solution happens

00:21:38,069 --> 00:21:40,872
in a more global way
with More help

00:21:40,872 --> 00:21:43,074
than just the two of you.

00:21:43,074 --> 00:21:46,911
But I can't see people
running to eat lionfish.

00:21:46,911 --> 00:21:49,848
And for that reason,
I'm out.

00:21:49,848 --> 00:21:51,983
Well, thank you all
for your time.

00:21:51,983 --> 00:21:54,052
Good luck, guys.
Very much so.

00:21:54,052 --> 00:21:54,919
Good luck.
Congratulations, too.
It was very interesting.

00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:57,856
Bye-Bye.

00:21:57,856 --> 00:21:58,790
It's a beautiful fish.
I want to go see
that fish.

00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,793
I know. They're great
in aquariums.

00:22:01,793 --> 00:22:03,928
They're so cool.
Look at the--look at
the tips on those spines.

00:22:03,928 --> 00:22:05,997
It's beautiful.

00:22:05,997 --> 00:22:07,999
It's also quite unattractive
when it's Fried up.

00:22:07,999 --> 00:22:10,935
It's primordial.
I love the fish.
I think it's beautiful.

00:22:10,935 --> 00:22:12,604
I didn't realize it was
such a big problem.

00:22:12,604 --> 00:22:14,606
He's not looking
so good now.

00:22:14,606 --> 00:22:16,174
We didn't get a deal,
but we're gonna move forward

00:22:16,174 --> 00:22:18,777
and we're gonna fight
this damn fish.

00:22:18,777 --> 00:22:20,779
There's more lionfish
in the sea today

00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:22,313
than there were yesterday.

00:22:22,313 --> 00:22:23,581
And that's gonna continue
to happen

00:22:23,581 --> 00:22:25,784
until somebody does
something about it.

00:22:25,784 --> 00:22:28,253

Hi, everyone.
Hey, Lani.

00:22:45,109 --> 00:22:46,310
I was born to be
an entrepreneur.

00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:48,779
I wanted to go over these
sales numbers with you.

00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:51,081
When I was in third grade,
I started selling

00:22:51,081 --> 00:22:52,750
hair scrunchies
out of my backpack

00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,352
to my friends at school,
and that was just the beginning.

00:22:55,352 --> 00:22:57,354
A few years later
when I was 11,

00:22:57,354 --> 00:22:58,756
I started simple sugars.

00:22:58,756 --> 00:23:00,958
Simple sugars products provide
a high-end

00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:02,960
skin care experience,
while also being

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,094
completely all natural

00:23:04,094 --> 00:23:05,963
and safe for even
the most sensitive skin.

00:23:05,963 --> 00:23:07,164
Tie the bow on,
trim it up,

00:23:07,164 --> 00:23:09,700
and give it to me, and I'll
pack 'em into the box.

00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,034
Ever since the beginning,
I've always been the one

00:23:11,034 --> 00:23:13,170
really running this business.

00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,438
I have gone
to all my own meetings,

00:23:14,438 --> 00:23:16,774
negotiated all my own deals,

00:23:16,774 --> 00:23:18,166
even from the time
when I was 11.

00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:20,168
I know. Oh, Kate!
(laughter)

00:23:20,168 --> 00:23:23,305
My family is so important to me,
especially my mom.

00:23:23,305 --> 00:23:24,539
Sports is not your thing.
(laughs)
Yeah, I know.

00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:27,208
She drove me to every meeting
until I could get

00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:28,877
my driver's license,
and she's been behind me

00:23:28,877 --> 00:23:29,544
supporting me all the way.

00:23:29,544 --> 00:23:32,414
I need an investment
from the sharks because

00:23:32,414 --> 00:23:34,683
Simple Sugars has grown
as much as it can

00:23:34,683 --> 00:23:36,818
with how we've been able
to fund it.

00:23:36,818 --> 00:23:39,354
We've been bootstrapping
this business on credit cards,

00:23:39,354 --> 00:23:40,955
and now we really need
to put a little bit of money

00:23:40,955 --> 00:23:43,625
behind it to be able
to capitalize on its growth.

00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:46,161
I've risked a lot
to make my dream come True.

00:23:46,161 --> 00:23:48,096
I've had to give up
my good grades in high school,

00:23:48,096 --> 00:23:52,100
my friends, a lot of
my childhood experiences.

00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,234
So getting a deal
from the sharks

00:23:53,234 --> 00:23:55,437
would really make it all
worth it.

00:23:57,405 --> 00:24:00,408
♪♪

00:24:12,153 --> 00:24:14,289
Hi. My name is Lani Lazzari.

00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:15,423
I'm from
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,

00:24:15,423 --> 00:24:17,959
and my company
is Simple Sugars.

00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:20,028
I'm seeking $100,000

00:24:20,028 --> 00:24:22,630
in exchange for 10% equity
in my company.

00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:25,633
I started simple Sugars
almost seven years ago

00:24:25,633 --> 00:24:27,102
when I was 11 years old.

00:24:27,102 --> 00:24:31,139
Since infancy, I've suffered
from horrible eczema.

00:24:31,139 --> 00:24:33,074
I couldn't find
a single product that I could

00:24:33,074 --> 00:24:34,743
safely use
on my sensitive skin,

00:24:34,743 --> 00:24:37,479
let alone one
that actually smelled good.

00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:39,414
So, as a determined
11-year-old,

00:24:39,414 --> 00:24:41,282
I started doing research
and got to work

00:24:41,282 --> 00:24:42,951
creating the product
I was looking for.

00:24:42,951 --> 00:24:46,287
My homemade creation
not only took away my eczema,

00:24:46,287 --> 00:24:49,090
but it also cleared up
my Aunt's psoriasis.

00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:51,292
Soon I was getting requests
from my friends and family

00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:52,827
to buy my products.

00:24:52,827 --> 00:24:53,695
I couldn't pass up
the opportunity

00:24:53,695 --> 00:24:55,697
to become a businesswoman,

00:24:55,697 --> 00:24:57,766
despite the fact that I wasn't
even a teenager yet.

00:24:57,766 --> 00:25:00,635
Simple Sugars products are
all-Natural sugar scrubs.

00:25:00,635 --> 00:25:03,138
They gently exfoliate,
providing deep moisture

00:25:03,138 --> 00:25:05,740
and complete skin nourishment
in one easy step.

00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:09,144
The result is super smooth,
great-Looking skin

00:25:09,144 --> 00:25:11,079
without using a laundry list
of products.

00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:13,014
Up until this point,
I've been growing simple sugars

00:25:13,014 --> 00:25:15,950
while simultaneously being
a high school student.

00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,752
Now that I've graduated,
I'm ready to do

00:25:17,752 --> 00:25:20,555
whatever it takes
to blow the lid off this thing.

00:25:20,555 --> 00:25:23,024
But I need a little help.
That's where you guys come in.

00:25:23,024 --> 00:25:25,427
Lori, I would love it
if you would come up

00:25:25,427 --> 00:25:27,429
and try out the products.

00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:31,766
Now, I have three of
our bestselling body scrubs

00:25:31,766 --> 00:25:32,700
to choose from.
Would you like to try

00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,569
strawberry, coconut,
or lemonade?

00:25:34,569 --> 00:25:37,071
Uh, strawberry.
Okay.

00:25:37,071 --> 00:25:38,339
Here, take a smell.

00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:39,941
Ooh, that smells great.
S--

00:25:39,941 --> 00:25:41,876
Gonna give you a little
bit of water.

00:25:41,876 --> 00:25:43,812
She might melt.
(laughter)

00:25:43,812 --> 00:25:46,014
I'm gonna give you
a little bit of scrub.

00:25:46,014 --> 00:25:48,149
Okay. So now you
want to scrub

00:25:48,149 --> 00:25:50,418
until it feels like the sugar
crystals start to melt.

00:25:50,418 --> 00:25:53,154
They have a very small
crystal size,

00:25:53,154 --> 00:25:55,690
which means that sugar is
a very gentle exfoliant,

00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:56,891
so it's safe
for sensitive skin.

00:25:56,891 --> 00:25:59,027
They're
completely all-natural.

00:25:59,027 --> 00:26:00,428
They have no
artificial colorings,

00:26:00,428 --> 00:26:03,364
preservatives, scents,
anything in them.

00:26:03,364 --> 00:26:06,301
All of the oils are chosen
because they're safe

00:26:06,301 --> 00:26:08,970
for sensitive skin, and also
because they absorb quickly,

00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,605
so you're left feeling
smooth and not greasy.

00:26:10,605 --> 00:26:13,274
So... wanna dry 'em off?

00:26:13,274 --> 00:26:15,810
And how do they feel?

00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:18,480
It feels very, very soft.
Yeah.

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,682
So that's the oils in it?
The--
that's the oils in it.

00:26:20,682 --> 00:26:23,284
The sugar removes the barrier
of dead skin cells

00:26:23,284 --> 00:26:24,486
that naturally sits on top
of your skin...

00:26:24,486 --> 00:26:27,155
smells great.
Which allows the oils
to penetrate into your skin

00:26:27,155 --> 00:26:28,957
and provide that moisture.

00:26:28,957 --> 00:26:30,358
Where have you been
selling this?

00:26:30,358 --> 00:26:32,827
60% of our sales are on
the simple sugars Web site.
Okay.

00:26:32,827 --> 00:26:35,363
But we also do
wholesale as well.

00:26:35,363 --> 00:26:39,567
And we are in our largest
local high-End grocery chain.

00:26:39,567 --> 00:26:40,568
What are your sales, Lani?

00:26:40,568 --> 00:26:43,938
Our sales year-to-date
are $55,000.

00:26:43,938 --> 00:26:46,007
What do you think you'll do
this calendar year?

00:26:46,007 --> 00:26:48,209
This calendar year,
we're projecting

00:26:48,209 --> 00:26:49,677
very conservatively
$100,000.

00:26:49,677 --> 00:26:51,679
What do you think
you'll make on it?

00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,949
Our profit margins
are 75% to 80%.

00:26:54,949 --> 00:26:56,217
But you're not paying yourself
anything yet?

00:26:56,217 --> 00:26:59,020
Sometimes I take
a small salary--

00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:02,023
Um, $400 a month--When we
have the cash flow for it.
Couple gummi bears, Yeah.

00:27:02,023 --> 00:27:03,958
Yeah. (laughs)
(Robert) Lani,
I'm more interested

00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:05,760
than the money right now--

00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,363
How did you come up
with the formulas?

00:27:08,363 --> 00:27:10,565
Like, uh, like the chemistry
behind it?

00:27:10,565 --> 00:27:13,701
I was more aware
of skin care products

00:27:13,701 --> 00:27:15,503
than the average 11-year-old,

00:27:15,503 --> 00:27:16,938
'cause I was always
at the dermatologist's office

00:27:16,938 --> 00:27:18,806
with all of these problems.

00:27:18,806 --> 00:27:21,009
So I started doing research,
and, to be honest,

00:27:21,009 --> 00:27:23,144
I just got obsessed with it.

00:27:23,144 --> 00:27:24,946
So I just started,
through trial and error,

00:27:24,946 --> 00:27:27,949
making products
and trying them on myself.

00:27:27,949 --> 00:27:30,351
You don't have
any mainstream distribution.

00:27:30,351 --> 00:27:31,619
You're a niche player
online.

00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:34,222
You have $100,000 in sales.

00:27:34,222 --> 00:27:36,891
But it's not worth
a million dollars.

00:27:36,891 --> 00:27:39,894
Now, tell me why--
I don't care what age you are.

00:27:39,894 --> 00:27:41,896
If you bring out here
a million-dollar valuation,

00:27:41,896 --> 00:27:43,298
you gotta defend it.
Yes.

00:27:43,298 --> 00:27:44,766
So defend it.

00:27:44,766 --> 00:27:46,701
I am willing to negotiate
on that,

00:27:46,701 --> 00:27:48,770
but there are a few things
I'd like you to consider first.

00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:51,806
In 2010, I was a sophomore
in high school.

00:27:51,806 --> 00:27:53,608
My sales were $13,000.

00:27:53,608 --> 00:27:55,810
At that point, I decided
that I wanted to actually

00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:57,879
focus on growing
this business.

00:27:57,879 --> 00:28:00,882
So I basically took
the whole year off

00:28:00,882 --> 00:28:03,151
to work full-time
on growing the business.

00:28:03,151 --> 00:28:04,953
As a result of my efforts
that year,

00:28:04,953 --> 00:28:08,890
my sales grew to $38,000,
a 192% increase,

00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:12,160
and I did all of that
by myself

00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,964
with no funding and no help
as a high school student.

00:28:15,964 --> 00:28:18,633
Now, in the past three months
since I've graduated

00:28:18,633 --> 00:28:21,035
and been able to work
full-time,

00:28:21,035 --> 00:28:23,938
I have grown simple sugars'
retail presence

00:28:23,938 --> 00:28:24,806
from 6 stores to 20.

00:28:24,806 --> 00:28:28,009
I've made it
the top-Selling specialty brand

00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:29,744
in our local high-End
grocery chain,

00:28:29,744 --> 00:28:30,411
and I'm in the process
of negotiating

00:28:30,411 --> 00:28:33,681
a deal worth
$150,000 to $400,000

00:28:33,681 --> 00:28:35,083
over the next two years

00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:38,753
with a high-End online
Skin care retailer.

00:28:38,753 --> 00:28:41,823
You said that it cured
your own eczema and psoriasis.

00:28:41,823 --> 00:28:44,559
It's really hard to be able
to make a claim like that.

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,294
We don't make any claims

00:28:46,294 --> 00:28:47,562
about what the product
will do for you.

00:28:47,562 --> 00:28:49,897
What we do talk a lot
about is the benefits

00:28:49,897 --> 00:28:51,766
of each individual
ingredient,

00:28:51,766 --> 00:28:52,433
which is something
you can say.

00:28:52,433 --> 00:28:54,902
But we can't make any claims
about it curing eczema

00:28:54,902 --> 00:28:57,405
or psoriasis. I can only
speak from my experience.

00:28:57,405 --> 00:29:00,341
What does your dermatologist
say when you go back to him

00:29:00,341 --> 00:29:02,343
or her and present this
to them,

00:29:02,343 --> 00:29:04,412
and is he recommending--
Or her--recommending it

00:29:04,412 --> 00:29:05,947
to his other patients?

00:29:05,947 --> 00:29:07,548
Oh, yes, definitely.
She uses the products.

00:29:07,548 --> 00:29:09,150
She loves them.

00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:11,886
'cause I have three kids,
and my wife literally

00:29:11,886 --> 00:29:14,222
would come and make
your bed every day...
yes.

00:29:14,222 --> 00:29:16,090
I would, too, for that matter,
if it kept my--My son

00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:18,359
in particular from itching
all over.
(laughs)

00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:19,293
Yes.
Well, it's a huge problem.

00:29:19,293 --> 00:29:20,895
There are 30 million people
in the United States

00:29:20,895 --> 00:29:23,831
that have eczema,
and 52% of the population

00:29:23,831 --> 00:29:27,101
describes themselves
as having sensitive skin.

00:29:27,101 --> 00:29:29,800
We heavily market it
as a product for sensitive skin.

00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,769
That's something that
we can say.
And you're allowed to say that?

00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:34,171
Right.
Oh, yes. We're perfectly
allowed to say that.

00:29:34,171 --> 00:29:37,041
It is one of the hardest things
you could do with your life,

00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:39,000
starting a business,
being an entrepreneur.
Oh, yes.

00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,469
What inspired you to start
your own business?

00:29:41,469 --> 00:29:44,940
When I was much younger,
my mom went on maternity leave

00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,875
with my youngest brother.

00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:48,143
And while she was away
on maternity leave,

00:29:48,143 --> 00:29:50,278
she got passed over
for a promised promotion.

00:29:50,278 --> 00:29:51,947
At that point,
I was very discouraged,

00:29:51,947 --> 00:29:53,949
especially as a woman,
about one day

00:29:53,949 --> 00:29:56,284
going into
the corporate world.

00:29:56,284 --> 00:29:58,286
So from that point on,
I decided

00:29:58,286 --> 00:29:59,688
that I wanted to be
an entrepreneur

00:29:59,688 --> 00:30:01,957
so I could be responsible
for my own success.

00:30:01,957 --> 00:30:04,659
I was the same way.
I didn't want to be

00:30:04,659 --> 00:30:06,328
under control
of somebody else.

00:30:06,328 --> 00:30:08,597
I wanted to lead
my own destiny.
Yes.

00:30:08,597 --> 00:30:13,134
And I am super impressed that
you are doing what you're doing.

00:30:13,134 --> 00:30:15,670
I-I do want to know what--what
are you gonna do with the money?

00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:19,874
$50,000 is going to go towards
hiring 2 part-time salespeople

00:30:19,874 --> 00:30:21,009
to support
our initial accounts.

00:30:21,009 --> 00:30:24,212
Because right now I'm focusing
too much of my time

00:30:24,212 --> 00:30:25,080
on supporting the accounts
we already have,

00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,883
and not enough time
on seeking out larger accounts.

00:30:28,883 --> 00:30:31,486
And where are you currently
making the goods and--

00:30:31,486 --> 00:30:33,154
is this all out of your house?
No, not anymore.

00:30:33,154 --> 00:30:34,956
We have a facility
in pittsburgh.

00:30:34,956 --> 00:30:36,157
Everything is made there,

00:30:36,157 --> 00:30:38,193
and that's also
where we have our offices.

00:30:38,193 --> 00:30:39,861
I have three employees

00:30:39,861 --> 00:30:41,997
who do all the manufacturing
of the products.

00:30:41,997 --> 00:30:44,733
Uh, I really am questioning,
do you really need us,

00:30:44,733 --> 00:30:47,535
or--Or me?
Because you're doing great.

00:30:47,535 --> 00:30:49,070
You can grow yourself,

00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:51,406
and I would not complement
your business,

00:30:51,406 --> 00:30:55,143
and I think it would be,
um, counterproductive

00:30:55,143 --> 00:30:57,612
for us to partner up
in that sense.

00:30:57,612 --> 00:30:59,881
So, with that said,
I'm out.

00:30:59,881 --> 00:31:02,083
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:04,486
Lani, I love you.

00:31:04,486 --> 00:31:07,489
I think you are amazing.
Amazing.

00:31:09,491 --> 00:31:11,126
The quality's great.
It smells great.

00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,262
I'm so impressed by you.

00:31:14,262 --> 00:31:15,664
Thank you.

00:31:15,664 --> 00:31:18,066
But...

00:31:18,066 --> 00:31:21,269
♪♪

00:31:29,644 --> 00:31:31,046
Lani, I love you.

00:31:31,046 --> 00:31:34,382
I think you are amazing.

00:31:34,382 --> 00:31:36,251
Amazing.
Thank you.

00:31:36,251 --> 00:31:38,253
And the quality's great,
it smells great.

00:31:38,253 --> 00:31:41,122
But for me, I think there's
too much competition

00:31:41,122 --> 00:31:43,124
with scrubs out there,

00:31:43,124 --> 00:31:45,293
so I'm not going to offer you
any money...

00:31:45,293 --> 00:31:47,028
okay.
For this.

00:31:47,028 --> 00:31:48,830
I'm out.

00:31:49,898 --> 00:31:51,700
(Kevin) Okay, Lani.

00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,301
Here's what I know
is a reality.

00:31:53,301 --> 00:31:56,171
The cosmetics industry,
of which you're a part of,

00:31:56,171 --> 00:31:57,505
is the most competitive
on earth. Why?

00:31:57,505 --> 00:32:00,308
Because the only products that
have higher margins are illegal.

00:32:00,308 --> 00:32:02,577
(chuckles) Yes.
(Lori chuckles)

00:32:02,577 --> 00:32:05,447
It's virtually impossible
to get share

00:32:05,447 --> 00:32:07,849
from the large companies
that own this space.

00:32:07,849 --> 00:32:09,851
There's absolutely
nothing proprietary

00:32:09,851 --> 00:32:11,653
of what you're doing
at all.

00:32:11,653 --> 00:32:13,922
It's so simple to do that
even an 11-year-Old can do it,

00:32:13,922 --> 00:32:15,924
and apparently has.
Yes.

00:32:15,924 --> 00:32:18,693
But what really strikes me is,

00:32:18,693 --> 00:32:20,362
you think it's worth
a million dollars.

00:32:20,362 --> 00:32:22,364
Yes.

00:32:22,364 --> 00:32:23,898
Not a chance in hell,

00:32:23,898 --> 00:32:26,768
no matter how wonderful
your story is.
(chuckles)

00:32:27,035 --> 00:32:29,304
I'm not interested. I'm out.

00:32:30,305 --> 00:32:33,641
Lani, I think if the measure
of success in a business

00:32:33,641 --> 00:32:36,778
was drive and passion,

00:32:36,778 --> 00:32:37,979
your business would be
successful.

00:32:37,979 --> 00:32:39,514
Yes.

00:32:39,514 --> 00:32:42,050
I-I think my challenge
with it is

00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:45,987
it is a very, very
difficult task

00:32:45,987 --> 00:32:48,323
that you're trying to take on.

00:32:48,323 --> 00:32:50,458
For me to give you
the $100,000,

00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:52,827
I would have to negotiate
such a value from you,

00:32:52,827 --> 00:32:55,964
that it's... unequitable
to you...
yes.

00:32:55,964 --> 00:32:58,900
And it becomes
unequitable to me.
Yes.

00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,769
And you don't want
to do that...
No.

00:33:00,769 --> 00:33:02,103
And I don't want to do that
to you.
No, and--

00:33:02,103 --> 00:33:04,706
So on this investment,
I'm out.

00:33:06,641 --> 00:33:09,043
Four sharks are out.

00:33:09,043 --> 00:33:12,046
Mark is Lani's last chance
for an investment.

00:33:12,046 --> 00:33:13,848
I'm not an expert
in this market, obviously.

00:33:13,848 --> 00:33:15,784
Yes.
All I know is the suffering
my kids go through.

00:33:15,784 --> 00:33:18,186
Yes.
So I want you
to explain to me

00:33:18,186 --> 00:33:20,321
for my 3-year-old son--

00:33:20,321 --> 00:33:23,792
He's got it all right here
where his eczema is.
Mm-hmm.

00:33:23,792 --> 00:33:26,027
What should he do?
What product should he be using?

00:33:26,027 --> 00:33:29,297
Eczema is a scaly,
dry skin condition.

00:33:29,297 --> 00:33:31,299
So gentle exfoliation
is really important

00:33:31,299 --> 00:33:33,034
to helping alleviate it.

00:33:33,034 --> 00:33:34,969
So the scrubs,
with the blend of the sugar

00:33:34,969 --> 00:33:36,771
and the oils
that are in there--

00:33:36,771 --> 00:33:39,641
That's especially what's good
to use on eczema.

00:33:39,641 --> 00:33:41,643
So...
okay. Who do you see
as your primary competition,

00:33:41,643 --> 00:33:43,044
and name the company name.

00:33:43,044 --> 00:33:44,779
Fresh.

00:33:44,779 --> 00:33:46,581
And why do you think they're
your primary competition?

00:33:46,581 --> 00:33:49,184
Because they have
a very comparable product

00:33:49,184 --> 00:33:50,385
quality-wise,

00:33:50,385 --> 00:33:53,455
and most of the time,
we get customers

00:33:53,455 --> 00:33:56,191
who come to us from
using a fresh scrub

00:33:56,191 --> 00:33:57,392
and switch to our company,

00:33:57,392 --> 00:33:59,427
because we are
more affordable than them.

00:33:59,427 --> 00:34:03,031
I don't think we ever heard
the cost for your product.

00:34:03,031 --> 00:34:05,033
They're $15.95
for the large size,

00:34:05,033 --> 00:34:08,770
which is this size.
And how much does a comparable
fresh product cost?

00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:10,238
$74.

00:34:10,238 --> 00:34:11,906
And the cost
to make the scrub?

00:34:11,906 --> 00:34:13,308
$3.61.

00:34:13,308 --> 00:34:15,844
And how low do you think
you can get that cost?

00:34:15,844 --> 00:34:18,313
Uh, I can cut it at least
in half by doubling the sales.

00:34:22,584 --> 00:34:23,985
Mark, has she convinced you?

00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,801
She's darn good.

00:34:26,801 --> 00:34:28,803
Okay, here's what
I'm willing to do.

00:34:28,803 --> 00:34:33,108
I'm willing
to invest $100,000...
okay.

00:34:33,108 --> 00:34:34,576
For 33% of the company.

00:34:34,576 --> 00:34:36,044
Okay.

00:34:36,044 --> 00:34:39,714
And the reason why 33%
from where you are is,

00:34:39,714 --> 00:34:42,984
there's gonna be considerable,
um, requirements of my time.

00:34:42,984 --> 00:34:43,585
And I value my time.

00:34:47,322 --> 00:34:49,324
I'd like to counter.
Okay.

00:34:49,324 --> 00:34:50,659
Would you accept $100,000

00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:54,129
for 25% equity?

00:34:54,129 --> 00:34:55,730
No, I would not.

00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:57,933
Okay. So you won't go
any lower than 33%?

00:34:57,933 --> 00:34:59,868
No.

00:35:04,339 --> 00:35:07,709
Mark... I would love
to accept your offer.

00:35:07,709 --> 00:35:09,377
That's what I like to hear.

00:35:09,377 --> 00:35:10,378
I'm very excited
to work together.

00:35:10,378 --> 00:35:12,447
So am I. Congratulations.

00:35:12,447 --> 00:35:13,448
Thank you so much. Thank you.
Thanks, sweetie.

00:35:13,448 --> 00:35:15,250
And please take some home
to your kids as Well,

00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,118
so they can try it out.
Trust me, I'm already
grabbin' everybody's.

00:35:17,118 --> 00:35:18,053
Great.
Thank you so much.
Thanks. Congratulations,
Lani.

00:35:18,053 --> 00:35:19,387
Thank you.

00:35:19,387 --> 00:35:20,388
(Lori) Congratulations.
(Mark) Nice job.

00:35:20,388 --> 00:35:21,389
Thank you.

00:35:21,389 --> 00:35:22,991
You're amazing.

00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,262
She was one of the best pitchers
we've had here

00:35:27,262 --> 00:35:30,131
at any age.
She was 18.

00:35:30,131 --> 00:35:31,666
If that's our future,
we are in good hands.

00:35:31,666 --> 00:35:34,135
We're in really good shape.

00:35:34,135 --> 00:35:36,137
In the future, I hope
that I will be an inspiration

00:35:36,137 --> 00:35:38,406
to other young entrepreneurs

00:35:38,406 --> 00:35:39,908
and encourage them
to follow their dreams

00:35:39,908 --> 00:35:42,510
and that if you're passionate
and you're committed,

00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,044
you can do it.

00:35:58,827 --> 00:36:01,963
who's hoping to resurrect
an old idea.

00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:11,300
Hello, sharks.
My name is Jeffrey Miller.

00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,334
And my product
is called coolwraps.

00:36:12,334 --> 00:36:16,205
I'm seeking $100,000

00:36:16,205 --> 00:36:19,742
in exchange
for 40% equity in my company.

00:36:19,742 --> 00:36:21,143
Let me ask you a question--

00:36:21,143 --> 00:36:24,146
When was the last time
you had fun gift wrapping?

00:36:24,146 --> 00:36:25,481
Well, if you're
anything like me,

00:36:25,481 --> 00:36:27,616
and I'm gift wrap-Challenged,
the answer is "Never"...

00:36:27,616 --> 00:36:29,351
until now.

00:36:29,351 --> 00:36:32,154
Allow me to introduce you
to coolwraps.

00:36:32,154 --> 00:36:34,690
Coolwraps is
a shrink wrap gift bag

00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:36,892
that is so easy to use.

00:36:36,892 --> 00:36:38,360
We say it's as easy
as 1-2-3...

00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,830
stuff it, Seal it,
shrink it.

00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:44,033
Allow me to demonstrate.

00:36:44,033 --> 00:36:46,335
Simply place a gift
into a bag.

00:36:46,335 --> 00:36:50,005
Remove the protective film
from the adhesive strip.

00:36:50,005 --> 00:36:53,208
Fold it over and close it
like you would an envelope.

00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:57,012
And now with a hair Dryer,
you shrink it to fit.

00:36:57,012 --> 00:36:59,615
(whirring)
Simply run the hair Dryer
around the present,

00:36:59,615 --> 00:37:02,818
and you will instantly
see it start to shrink.

00:37:02,818 --> 00:37:05,821
Have you noticed
there's no tape, no scissors,

00:37:05,821 --> 00:37:09,158
no hassle,
and absolutely no mess?

00:37:09,158 --> 00:37:10,959
It's amazing.

00:37:10,959 --> 00:37:14,430
And in no time, you will have
a wonderfully wrapped gift.

00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:15,497
(Dryer turns off)

00:37:16,765 --> 00:37:19,468
Jeffrey, are those the ones
you did before?

00:37:19,468 --> 00:37:21,203
Yes. I did all of these
last night.

00:37:21,203 --> 00:37:23,672
And unlike regular
gift wrapping,

00:37:23,672 --> 00:37:25,340
I had fun doing it.

00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:29,278
I mean, coolwraps... (laughs)
Coolwraps is a great product,

00:37:29,278 --> 00:37:30,813
and it's proven,
and it's great.

00:37:30,813 --> 00:37:34,083
Um...

00:37:37,553 --> 00:37:38,821
it is an amazing product.

00:37:38,821 --> 00:37:41,023
I love it.
I'm passionate about it.

00:37:41,023 --> 00:37:42,958
I mean, it's perfect
for everyone.

00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:46,028
As I said, young and old,
male and female.

00:37:46,028 --> 00:37:50,099
And if you have
dexterity issues, it's perfect.

00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:53,335
This is a game-Changer now.
This is an amazing product.

00:37:53,335 --> 00:37:55,737
Jeff, can you tell us
about the business?

00:37:55,737 --> 00:37:58,941
This product was out on
the market about ten years ago.

00:37:58,941 --> 00:37:59,408
Then what happened?

00:37:59,408 --> 00:38:00,943
We were a partnership,

00:38:00,943 --> 00:38:02,945
and we got it out
into the market,

00:38:02,945 --> 00:38:05,814
we got on qvc twice,
and we sold out.

00:38:06,482 --> 00:38:09,751
We got tested in cvs,
and we sold out.

00:38:11,887 --> 00:38:14,623
We went to the banks.
We needed money to roll it out,

00:38:14,623 --> 00:38:18,694
and we couldn't get it.
We had purchase orders in hand.

00:38:18,694 --> 00:38:21,096
And they just wanted us
to collateralize our homes.

00:38:21,096 --> 00:38:21,763
They didn't care
about the orders.

00:38:21,763 --> 00:38:25,100
Well, how much were you
asking for from the bank?

00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,803
We needed, in order to fulfill
the larger quantities

00:38:27,803 --> 00:38:29,138
that we were
getting orders for,

00:38:29,138 --> 00:38:31,473
we needed $300,000
to $500,000.

00:38:32,674 --> 00:38:34,276
Jeff, when the bank manager

00:38:34,276 --> 00:38:37,012
was willing to lend you that
money--pretend I'm him--

00:38:37,012 --> 00:38:38,280
I say, "Jeff, I'm very excited

00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,816
"About your gift wrap bag,
shrink wrap, whatever.

00:38:40,816 --> 00:38:42,951
"I hope you're as excited
as I am,

00:38:42,951 --> 00:38:44,419
"because I'm gonna
lend you the money,

00:38:44,419 --> 00:38:46,755
"and I'm gonna put
as a collateral your home.

00:38:46,755 --> 00:38:48,223
"But you have
no problem with that,

00:38:48,223 --> 00:38:49,625
because you believe
in the product."

00:38:49,625 --> 00:38:50,626
I did.

00:38:50,626 --> 00:38:52,694
But the partnership--
in total,

00:38:52,694 --> 00:38:56,098
we had already put in
over $150,000 into it.

00:38:56,098 --> 00:38:57,499
Why didn't the other partners
also believe

00:38:57,499 --> 00:38:59,468
and be willing
to put up their homes?

00:39:02,671 --> 00:39:03,805
Well, we didn't want--

00:39:03,805 --> 00:39:05,274
This is the test
of a real entrepreneur.

00:39:05,274 --> 00:39:07,609
I--absolutely.
Do you take the chance?

00:39:07,609 --> 00:39:11,280
Do you bet it all?
I'm there with you.

00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:11,813
Obviously, you weren't
there with him,

00:39:11,813 --> 00:39:13,815
because you said No.
Why did you say no?

00:39:15,951 --> 00:39:17,886
I didn't say no.
The consensus was no.

00:39:17,886 --> 00:39:19,955
I wanted to bring in
venture capital.

00:39:19,955 --> 00:39:22,224
What percentage
of the company did you own?

00:39:22,224 --> 00:39:23,158
I was a 20% shareholder.

00:39:23,158 --> 00:39:25,894
And so fast forward to today.
Yes.

00:39:25,894 --> 00:39:27,429
How much of it do you own?

00:39:27,429 --> 00:39:29,498
I own 100% of this.

00:39:29,498 --> 00:39:32,334
But, Jeffrey, what happened
to the other partners?

00:39:32,334 --> 00:39:34,136
Well, we couldn't
fulfill the orders,

00:39:34,136 --> 00:39:36,605
they gave up,
and I acquired everything.

00:39:36,605 --> 00:39:38,140
What's happened?

00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,676
Why for ten years
did you do nothing with it?

00:39:40,676 --> 00:39:43,278
I've not been able to get
in front of the right people.

00:39:43,278 --> 00:39:44,680
I have been to trade shows,

00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,547
I have tried
to get the word out there.

00:39:45,547 --> 00:39:47,950
Did you stand there
with a blow Dryer,

00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,952
sealing,
getting people excited?

00:39:49,952 --> 00:39:53,755
Um, no. I went around
and tried to hand out my cards

00:39:53,755 --> 00:39:54,556
and get--Give some...

00:39:54,556 --> 00:39:57,159
Oh, my gosh.
So nobody saw
the product in action?

00:39:57,159 --> 00:39:58,560
No.
Nobody knew
what you were really selling?

00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,828
No.
So you didn't have a Booth?

00:39:59,828 --> 00:40:02,164
You were just
going around trolling?
Correct.

00:40:02,164 --> 00:40:03,165
I didn't--I didn't
have the money.
Jeffrey, you gotta--

00:40:03,165 --> 00:40:04,099
You gotta demonstrate this.

00:40:04,099 --> 00:40:06,068
I know.

00:40:06,068 --> 00:40:08,470
Is there anything else
like this out on the market?

00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:10,939
There is not. I have
a patent on it.
Not at all?

00:40:10,939 --> 00:40:11,873
Nothing.
It's a utility patent?

00:40:11,873 --> 00:40:13,075
It's a utility patent.

00:40:13,075 --> 00:40:15,077
You cannot make
anything like this.

00:40:15,077 --> 00:40:16,144
And how much does it cost you
to make one bag?

00:40:16,144 --> 00:40:18,480
Um... on average...

00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,551
on average.
Price is between
11 to 18 cents a bag.

00:40:22,551 --> 00:40:25,153
And then what did you sell them
for when you sold them on qvc?

00:40:25,153 --> 00:40:26,555
What was your offer?

00:40:26,555 --> 00:40:28,890
Qvc was a 20-Pack,
and they had a special price

00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:31,760
of--I think it was $16.88.

00:40:32,561 --> 00:40:34,696
Have you called anybody
to try and license this?

00:40:34,696 --> 00:40:36,565
No. I-I don't know
how to go about it,

00:40:36,565 --> 00:40:39,001
and that's why
I need your help.

00:40:39,001 --> 00:40:40,802
So you want us to bet
on a 10-year-Old product

00:40:40,802 --> 00:40:42,271
'cause you think we'll
bring it back into the market,

00:40:42,271 --> 00:40:44,406
and bingo--It'll come back.
Actually, I think--

00:40:44,406 --> 00:40:46,408
I am so happy
that it's happening now,

00:40:46,408 --> 00:40:48,810
because manufacturing processes
have improved.

00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:51,079
We can bring cost down.

00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:52,681
Jeff, it--It's great
that you love it,

00:40:52,681 --> 00:40:54,883
but my gosh--ten years?

00:40:54,883 --> 00:40:57,286
You--You've gotta
go and sell some.

00:40:57,286 --> 00:41:00,222
And obviously,
you're not the sales guy.

00:41:00,222 --> 00:41:01,690
I don't see the market.

00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:02,958
I'm sorry. I'm out.

00:41:06,962 --> 00:41:09,298
I'm not sure
about this product at all.

00:41:09,298 --> 00:41:09,765
I think it has potential,

00:41:09,765 --> 00:41:11,600
and I like
that you have a patent.

00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,469
I also think
it's a good tv product,

00:41:14,469 --> 00:41:16,672
but I think it needs
a lot of revamping.

00:41:16,672 --> 00:41:20,475
So what if I were
to give you $150,000

00:41:20,475 --> 00:41:22,210
and just buy you out?

00:41:23,612 --> 00:41:24,680
Whoa.

00:41:26,615 --> 00:41:29,751
You make $150,000.
The risk is mine.

00:41:29,751 --> 00:41:30,419
Because I'm really not sure.

00:41:30,419 --> 00:41:32,888
I don't like
that for ten years it sat.

00:41:32,888 --> 00:41:35,424
But I'm willing
to take the Gamble.

00:41:35,424 --> 00:41:38,226
You can continue
to do other things.

00:41:38,226 --> 00:41:40,362
You don't have
a 10-year dinosaur.

00:41:40,362 --> 00:41:45,233
And it becomes my problem
or my success.

00:41:46,601 --> 00:41:47,869
I'll tell you what--

00:41:47,869 --> 00:41:52,074
I'll give you $250,000
for the whole company...

00:41:52,074 --> 00:41:54,076
and a 3% royalty,

00:41:54,076 --> 00:41:55,477
but it's yes or no
right now.

00:41:55,477 --> 00:41:56,945
Whoa.

00:41:56,945 --> 00:41:58,613
Aggressive.

00:41:58,613 --> 00:42:01,149
Look at these sharks circling.

00:42:02,284 --> 00:42:04,019
Yes or no?

00:42:09,624 --> 00:42:10,625
Mark, I accept your offer.

00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:12,828
Done.
(Kevin) whoa!

00:42:12,828 --> 00:42:14,763
I like the way you think.
Wow.

00:42:14,763 --> 00:42:16,965
Congratulations.
You're a rich man.

00:42:16,965 --> 00:42:17,966
Thank you very much.

00:42:17,966 --> 00:42:19,267
How does it feel
to have 250 grand?

00:42:19,267 --> 00:42:19,801
That's amazing.

00:42:19,801 --> 00:42:21,136
Yes, it is. That's how we
do business, right?

00:42:21,136 --> 00:42:22,604
Uhh. Done.

00:42:22,604 --> 00:42:24,339
Lori, can I wrap
any presents for you?

00:42:25,807 --> 00:42:28,210
Yes! (laughs)

00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:29,277
Mark, I think that was
the fastest deal

00:42:29,277 --> 00:42:32,280
we've ever done.
(laughs)

00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,216
Next?
