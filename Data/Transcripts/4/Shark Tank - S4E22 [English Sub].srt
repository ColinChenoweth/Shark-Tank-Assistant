00:00:00,701 --> 00:00:02,169
Narrator:
The sharks are back

00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:04,771
in an all-new season
of "Shark Tank,"

00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:07,608
where hopeful entrepreneurs
from across the country

00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:10,277
dream of a chance
to secure an investment

00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:12,145
and gain powerful partners

00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:15,582
to start, grow,
or save their businesses.

00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:17,484
If the sharks hear a great idea,

00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:20,988
they're ready to invest
using their own money...

00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:22,856
you're a hero.
It's very innovative.

00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,591
Lori's squawking --
What are we doing here?

00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:27,861
Narrator:
...and They'll fight each other
for a piece of the action...

00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,863
What is going on
with Cuban this season?

00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,466
You guys have no vision
whatsoever.

00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:35,702
...but first, the entrepreneurs
must convince a shark

00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,905
to invest the full amount
they're asking for,

00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:40,140
or they'll walk away
with nothing.

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,909
I'm seeking
a $2 million investment.

00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:43,677
Wow.
How twisted is that?

00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:45,078
Narrator:
It's sink...

00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:46,480
bobber up.
And bam.

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,048
Please don't mess this pitch up.

00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,584
Narrator: ...or swim.
I'll make the first offer.

00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:52,085
No. I want to make
the first offer.
Excuse me.

00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:53,220
No, I want to make
the first offer.

00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,254
I want to make
the first offer.

00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:55,455
Whoa!

00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:57,724
Narrator:
Who are the sharks?

00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:03,063
They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors

00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,365
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.

00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:09,403
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist

00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,805
who turned a $10,000 loan

00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:16,410
into a software business
worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:21,348
Lori Greiner, the queen of qvc,
holds over 100 patents

00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:23,584
and has launched
over 300 products,

00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:26,954
grossing over a half a billion
dollars in retail sales.

00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:30,824
Daymond John is a fashion mogul
and branding expert

00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:32,092
Who grew
his homemade clothing line

00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,495
into the globally recognized
fashion brand fubu.

00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,299
Robert Herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,

00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,935
is now a technology mogul

00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:45,672
who sold his first internet
companies for over $350 million.

00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:51,411
And Mark Cuban -- Notorious
billionaire entrepreneur

00:01:51,411 --> 00:02:05,659
and the outspoken owner
of the Dallas Mavericks.

00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,260
First into the tank

00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,496
are Jeff Stafford
and Dusty Holloway

00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,098
with a product they believe

00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:13,133
is going to explode
in the fishing market.

00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,407
Hello, sharks.

00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:22,242
My name is Jeff Stafford,

00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,444
and this my longtime
hunting and fishing buddy

00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:25,545
Dusty Holloway.

00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,147
Our product
is the shell bobber.

00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:31,018
We are seeking $80,000
in exchange for 20% equity --

00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:33,887
That's 20% of the coolest
fishing accessory

00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:35,489
to ever hit the market.

00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,891
Now, earlier this year,
Dusty and I went hunting,

00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,960
and after firing
a shotgun,

00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,629
the empty shell fell into the
water and floated perfectly.

00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:43,764
I immediately thought,

00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:46,166
"That'd be a really cool
fishing bobber."

00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,435
The market would be huge,
as we'd be combining

00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:50,871
two complementary
multibillion-dollar industries,

00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:53,540
hunting and fishing.

00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,043
So we took the bobber
and we went to work.

00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:58,278
The first thing we did
was deprime it.

00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:01,281
And after depriming it,

00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:04,351
we stuffed it
with a floatable material.

00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:07,154
And after that,
we inserted a cap

00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:09,089
to make it look
real pretty-Like.

00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:14,561
And then, once you do that,
you insert a wooden dowel

00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,496
with slot in it
for the fishing line

00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:20,333
and then a spring on top of that
to make it stay on the line.

00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,735
Bobber up.
And bam.

00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,837
We had our very first
shell bobber.

00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:26,339
We were in love.

00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:28,408
In order to find out
if others would be as excited

00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,977
about the product as we were,
we had to test the market.

00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:32,479
I took the prototype

00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,048
and I called on local
bait-And-Tackle shops.

00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,283
People loved it so much,

00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:38,151
they were actually stealing it
off the shelves.

00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,153
We tested the market,
we proved the concept,

00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,489
and now we're here
looking for help,

00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:44,925
because we know every store
that sells fishing accessories

00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:46,927
is going to want to sell
the shell bobber.

00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:50,764
With a product this hot,
our passion, and your expertise,

00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:54,034
I know we can get it
in every one of those stores.

00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:56,870
So, sharks, which one of you
can I get on my hook,

00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,905
and which one needs
a three-Second head start?

00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,073
[ gun cocks ]

00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,775
[ laughter ]

00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:05,979
Jeff, I wonder if we have to use
all dead shells.

00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,415
Why not keep them alive
so when the fish pulls on it,

00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,417
it blows it
right out of the water?

00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,385
Cuban: That's what I thought
you were doing anyway.

00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:15,756
Yeah, but that wouldn't
have been a fair fight.

00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,491
Harrington:
So, Jeff, they're real shells?

00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:18,892
Stafford: They are real
shotgun shells -- 100%.

00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:19,960
And what's your cost?

00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,195
Our cost for the three-Pack
like that

00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:23,463
is actually under $1.

00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,799
Under $1.
And what are you selling it for?

00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,400
We retail that for $8.99.

00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:30,237
Wow.

00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:32,606
So, Jeff, this is
an important question,

00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,541
because I love fishing.

00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,477
I love the whole thing,
but $80,000 for 20% --

00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,446
Please don't
mess this pitch up --

00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:40,914
What are the sales?

00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:44,151
So in our market test,
we sold 440 units.

00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:46,119
It was a little
under $1,000.

00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,321
[ laughter ]

00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:51,491
Jeff, now I understand
why you brought the shotgun.
[ laughter ]

00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:54,161
'cause that's the only way
you're getting money today.

00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:56,763
So I want to just make sure I'm
getting everything straight.

00:04:56,763 --> 00:05:00,100
You've sold less than
$1,000 worth of product?
Correct.

00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,102
Daymond, he said they were
flying off the shelves,

00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:04,137
what do you mean they were
flying off the shelves?

00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,240
You know, honestly,
this is brand new to us,

00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,209
but to give you
an example --

00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:11,778
Ace hardware put us
in a pilot location,

00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,480
and they were selling
about a bobber a day.

00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,482
For us, it doesn't sound like
flying off the shelves,

00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,317
but for them in the
fishing-Accessory world --

00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,585
they're a hardware store.

00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:19,920
They had people coming in
buying a screwdriver.

00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,121
They ended up
buying a bobber.

00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,722
They're not
looking for this.
Right.

00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:25,392
They put us in another location
for about the same success.

00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:27,194
Well, there's 4,400
ace hardwares.

00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:30,130
If we can get in that, that's
1.6 million bobbers a year.

00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:35,368
Are you selling these online?
Do you have a patent, trademark?

00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,838
Is everything locked up
with all this?

00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,806
We've got a provisional patent
on the shell itself.

00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,208
We've trademarked
"Shell bobbers"

00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:44,010
and We've trademarked
the name "Fishing ammo."

00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,345
do you see anything wrong

00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,514
with the valuation
that you've put on the company?

00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:48,882
Honestly,
for a start-up company

00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:50,784
that hasn't really
officially launched a product,

00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:53,220
it's very tough
to come up with any valuation.
Yes. I agree.

00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,689
What we did was we decided
how much money we needed

00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,424
to get this going
the proper way,

00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:59,759
with the machines,
the inventory, legal fees,

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,795
turning that
into a real patent,

00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:03,997
and then
some operational expenses.

00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:05,765
I think it's gonna sell.
I really do.

00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,634
I think people
are gonna buy this thing

00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:09,936
if you get distribution,
which could be challenging.

00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:13,773
There's probably a distributor
in your sector

00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:16,710
that supplies 80%
of the fishing-tackle stores.

00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,111
You don't know
who that is yet, right?

00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,246
Yes, I do.

00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:20,981
Okay. Have you
shown it to them?
No.

00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:22,616
Why not?

00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:24,618
I'm kind of a perfectionist
in that I didn't really want to

00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:26,620
take it to a lot of places
until I was confident

00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,889
we had a product and packaging
that would be impressive.

00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:29,923
I think
there's something here.

00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:31,091
I'm willing to make you
an offer.

00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:32,659
I haven't finished.
I'll make the first offer.

00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,594
No, I want to make
the first offer.
Excuse me.

00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:35,929
No, I want to make
the first offer.

00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:37,130
I want to make
the first offer.

00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,064
Whoa!

00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,232
I'm getting
the shotgun.

00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,634
People normally
would give you three --

00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:41,801
I think there's
market confusion.

00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:44,004
Well, people would normally
give you three times,

00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:46,940
five times sales
if you're lucky.

00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,111
I'm willing to offer you
eight times sales for 20%,

00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:55,315
and you raise
the other the $72,000...

00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:57,484
Cuban:
That's not an offer!
...from one of the other sharks.

00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,119
That's like picking up
a Crumb and saying,

00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,287
"I just handed you
a cake."

00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:01,955
I gave them
eight times sales!

00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:02,989
[ Laughter ]

00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:04,591
O'Leary:
He's just messing around.

00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,060
He's not being a shark.
He's being a minnow.
Exactly.

00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,396
I'll make you a real offer.
You ready?
Please. Please.

00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:10,630
Here's how
it's gonna work.

00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:15,201
I'll give you $80,000
for 50%, all right?

00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:18,605
But how do I get
my money back?

00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,006
So here's
what we're gonna do.

00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:24,978
Every time you sell one,
I get 50 cents, all right?

00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:29,316
And after I get my money back,
that drops down to 10 cents.

00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:33,153
That simple.

00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,755
You know what? That's not
a bite. That's a throw-back.

00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:36,990
Greiner:
Wait, Jeff, Dusty --

00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,125
It was better than Daymond's,
I have to say.

00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,027
[ laughter ]
That's True.

00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,395
John: Whoa.
What am I here?

00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,130
At least we're improving.
You got two non-offers.

00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,300
Put aside the nonsense.
How are you gonna scale?

00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,336
'cause the challenge --
It's not a lot of money.

00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,204
You know, you guys
don't need a lot of cash

00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:52,939
'cause your margins
are huge, right?

00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,307
So that's not the issue.

00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,843
I'm guessing you were afraid
to go to the distributors

00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,645
because if they gave you
a big order,

00:07:58,645 --> 00:07:59,980
there's nothing
you can do.

00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,582
If we sold 10 million of these
a year, what are you gonna do?

00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,250
I could make 10 million
in a year.

00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,318
You're gonna do them?

00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,553
You're gonna
make 10 million a year?

00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,421
Myself? No.

00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,724
Just simple question --
just how?

00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:13,426
There's reloading machines,
crimps them,

00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:14,794
and then the last thing
we have to do

00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:15,829
is put the dowel
on them.

00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,364
So it's still
a manual process

00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:18,965
where you've got to
have someone

00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,900
physically doing
the Insertion?
Yeah.

00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,969
A part of the money
that we're looking for

00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:25,238
is to get out of his garage
and into a place

00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,773
where we can
keep the inventory,

00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,675
a few new machines
that we need to purchase,

00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,577
and then a few people
making an hourly wage

00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:32,445
that we can just have
stuffing the bobbers.

00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,514
Now, listen.
We're talking, we're squawking.

00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,750
But nobody's making any offers.
I'm the only one.

00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,219
Before you consider
Kevin's offer, let me...

00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:41,054
you gonna
throw something at them?

00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,889
Well, let me throw something
at you.

00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:45,725
I don't think you really have
a company yet.

00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,293
I think you have
a cool product.

00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,295
Will it sell
in the millions

00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,297
that you can build
an entire company around?

00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,299
I don't know.

00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:55,635
I'm out.

00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,973
I love fishing.
I'm not being funny.

00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:03,009
I probably fish about five
or six times a month.

00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,445
It's a great idea.

00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:08,248
I think it's too soon for me
because it's such a small,

00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:11,184
you know, proof of concept,
so I'm out.

00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:12,585
Okay.

00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:16,322
Greiner:
I have a question.
Yes.

00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:19,692
The provisional patent,
obviously a utility patent,

00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,362
what did your attorneys
tell you?

00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:24,164
What were their thoughts
as to whether or not

00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:25,765
they think you'll get a patent
on this?

00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:30,503
Well, we actually did
the provisional ourselves.

00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,439
So you did not do
an extensive search.

00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:33,940
No, I have not
done an extensive search.

00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,877
But, you know, I would be
willing to do a deal

00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,346
contingent upon
a search being done

00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,382
and having you feel
more comfortable about it.

00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:43,550
Wow.
He's got confidence.

00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,251
Were you thinking
of doing --

00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,620
Like, you started to talk
about other extensions.

00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,322
We've had a couple people
ask us for --

00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,257
there's glow-in-the-dark
for nighttime fishing

00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,860
where We actually can get clear
shells and do glow-in-the-dark.

00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,662
You can do glow-in-the-dark
plastic, yeah.

00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:57,997
And we're going to do
a saltwater shell, as well,

00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,466
that rattles
to attract the fish.

00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,267
So yeah, we can do
different variations.

00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,003
O'Leary: The question is --
You have no offers.

00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,473
Lori's squawking,
not doing anything.
I'm not squawking.

00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:09,275
I'm the only offer you have.
What are we doing here?

00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:11,978
Well, any other offers?

00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,046
Lori? Mark?

00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:16,182
Doesn't look good.

00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,499
Narrator:
Two sharks are out.

00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:35,168
Jeff and Dusty have an offer
from Kevin O'Leary,

00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:38,671
but they're hoping to get a
better offer from Lori or mark.

00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,907
Question is --
You have no offers.

00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:43,409
Lori's squawking,
not doing anything.
I'm not squawking.

00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,645
I'm the only offer you have.
What are we doing here?

00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,882
Well, any other offers?

00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:49,949
Lori? Mark?

00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:53,419
Doesn't look good.

00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,725
What was your offer
again?

00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:00,460
It was so horrible
I don't remember it.

00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,262
I will have to have him
recap that, actually.

00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:04,197
You ready?
It's very simple.

00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:05,932
You know, I never forget
a good offer,

00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:09,169
so I'm able to tell it to you
again with ease.

00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,004
I give you the $80,000
for 50%.

00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,606
Every time you sell one,
I get 50 cents

00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:17,510
until I get my $80,000 back,
and then it drops to a dime.

00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,878
It's that simple.

00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:22,348
Yeah, you know, honestly,
I don't think we're comfortable

00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,917
giving away 50% just yet.

00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,820
You know what, guys?
You just gave the right answer.

00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,023
You're getting out there
and hustling

00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,091
and doing it
the exact right way.

00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,726
So for that reason,
I'll make you an offer.

00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:39,866
I'll offer you the $80,000,
and I want 33%.

00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:42,635
Not 33 1/3%
so we're all the same,

00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:47,040
but 33%, so this way, you both
own more stock than I do, right?

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,241
So it's still
your baby,

00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:49,943
and you guys have
all the incentive --

00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:53,112
but $80,000 for 33%.

00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:55,815
What's wrong with you?
Greiner: [ laughs ]

00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,884
I see nothing wrong
with you.
Deal?

00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:00,653
He must be scared
of that shotgun.

00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,121
What are you
talking about?!

00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:04,023
yes or no, guys. You got to be
able to say yes or No.

00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,191
These guys put a shell
on a --

00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,760
You got to be able
to say yes or no.

00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,064
Yes, we will accept
your offer, Mark.
Done.

00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,066
Greiner: Oh, my God.
I wasn't even out yet.

00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,033
John: Shocking.

00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:15,168
Mark, you're the one.

00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:17,103
[ laughs ]
of course.

00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,838
Congratulations, guys.
Good job.

00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:20,907
What is going on
with Cuban this season?

00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,041
What do you mean?

00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,910
I take great deals
And make them better.

00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,279
You guys just have no vision --
None whatsoever.

00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,280
Oh, my god.

00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,982
They put a shotgun shell
on a string.

00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:31,217
Are you kidding me?

00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:33,219
You guys have no vision
whatsoever.

00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,555
That's a horrible,
horrible deal.

00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:37,757
You guys just don't know
how to invest in people, then.

00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,858
You really don't.

00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:41,461
These guys are doing
everything exactly right.

00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:43,496
Why did you put
such a high valuation on it?

00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,765
You spent more than that
last night on cocktails.

00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,166
So?

00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,369
Thanks to mark Cuban
and his investment

00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:50,536
and belief
in our product,

00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:53,473
shell bobbers
are gonna be a reality

00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:54,807
in every fishing store.

00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:57,377
We are gonna be living
the American dream.

00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:05,551
Narrator: In season 3,
Billy Blanks jr. Made a deal

00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,453
with Mark Cuban and Daymond John

00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,089
for his workout system,
dance with me.

00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:12,091
I would definitely take
that deal.
John:
Don't make me cry.

00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,060
Let's see what he's up to now.

00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:17,830
John: I brought Billy Blanks jr.
To boise, idaho, today

00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,632
for a special meeting
I've arranged

00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,835
with the largest online
fitness company in the world.

00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:24,771
What's up?
Hey. Daymond John.

00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:26,339
Bodybuilding.Com is huge.

00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:27,840
They have 20 million viewers
a month.

00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,009
This is perfect
for Billy Blanks jr.,

00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,411
and it's a huge deal.

00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:32,712
Billy is about
changing lives,

00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:34,147
and I knew that
bodybuilding.Com

00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,515
is about changing lives
as well.

00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:37,617
We heard your story.
I was talking with Dean.

00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:39,519
I was like, "We have to
do content with this guy."

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,754
We want to put you in front
of our 20 million users

00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:43,323
and get your content
on our website.

00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,757
We want to get started
on this deal today.

00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,626
We've got a contract
ready to go.

00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:49,062
We have the gym
and our video team on standby,

00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:50,930
and we're shooting content
this afternoon.

00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,265
Wow.
This is awesome.

00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:53,766
Blanks: I knew Daymond
and mark would deliver.

00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,935
I had no idea that
I was gonna be filming today.

00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,437
[ chuckles ]
but I'm excited about that.

00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:58,638
One, two, three.

00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:00,273
We are truly excited

00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:01,841
about this deal
with bodybuilding.Com.

00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,042
This is our first big deal.

00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,944
It's gonna help us reach
a whole new Audience

00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:07,180
and help us bridge that gap
between Dance and fitness.

00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,581
Oh, yeah!
Come on. One.

00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,717
And we're really excited
because over the next 12 months,

00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:12,518
we're projecting to hit
our first million dollars.

00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,455
"Shark Tank"
has truly changed our lives.

00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,767
Tracey:
My name's Tracey Noonan,

00:14:31,767 --> 00:14:33,133
and this is my daughter
Danielle.

00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:34,934
We're from Cohasset,
Massachusetts.

00:14:34,934 --> 00:14:36,936
Danielle: And our company
is Wicked Good Cupcakes.

00:14:36,936 --> 00:14:39,873
We're from Boston, and
everything's wicked pissa here.

00:14:39,873 --> 00:14:41,708
[ both laugh ]

00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,743
our cupcakes are baked fresh
daily from scratch.

00:14:43,743 --> 00:14:46,513
No boxes or mixes
are ever used.

00:14:46,513 --> 00:14:48,982
I am head baker,
and she is head decorator.

00:14:48,982 --> 00:14:50,684
You need any help
with Anything?

00:14:50,684 --> 00:14:52,952
Tracey: Danielle and I
have always been very close.

00:14:52,952 --> 00:14:55,055
We make all our decisions
together.

00:14:55,055 --> 00:14:56,289
[ scoffs ]
No. No, we don't.

00:14:56,289 --> 00:14:58,825
She makes most of
the decisions all the time.

00:15:00,427 --> 00:15:01,761
Mom, the red velvets
are done.

00:15:01,761 --> 00:15:05,098
We're at a point where
our company is growing too fast

00:15:05,098 --> 00:15:08,101
for us to keep up,
and we actually have a new twist

00:15:08,101 --> 00:15:11,304
on how to share our wicked good
cupcakes with the nation.

00:15:11,304 --> 00:15:13,139
Oh, this was
only half a dozen?
Yeah.

00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:15,775
Are you worried the sharks
won't understand our accent?

00:15:15,775 --> 00:15:18,244
No, I'm not worried
they won't understand us.

00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,058
Hi, sharks.

00:15:32,058 --> 00:15:33,093
I'm Tracey Noonan,

00:15:33,093 --> 00:15:34,928
and this is my daughter
Danielle.

00:15:34,928 --> 00:15:36,896
We own and operate
Wicked Good Cupcakes.

00:15:36,896 --> 00:15:39,866
We're here today
seeking $75,000

00:15:39,866 --> 00:15:42,902
in return for a 20% equity
in our company.

00:15:42,902 --> 00:15:45,839
Two years ago,
buttercup moved out.

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,307
As a mom,
I was heartbroken.

00:15:47,307 --> 00:15:50,043
I decided we should take
cake-decorating classes

00:15:50,043 --> 00:15:51,978
as a way to spend some time
together.

00:15:51,978 --> 00:15:54,848
Well, before we knew it,
in October 2011,

00:15:54,848 --> 00:15:56,883
Wicked Good Cupcakes
was born.

00:15:56,883 --> 00:16:00,353
We received tons of requests
to ship our cupcakes nationwide.

00:16:00,353 --> 00:16:02,455
It was a big challenge, though,
trying to figure out

00:16:02,455 --> 00:16:03,923
how to keep them fresh
and intact,

00:16:03,923 --> 00:16:06,259
and that's when we came up
with the idea

00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:07,927
of shipping them
in a jar.

00:16:07,927 --> 00:16:10,730
Our cupcake jars
are baked fresh daily.

00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,299
We layer them with homemade
frosting and filling,

00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:16,002
ship them in gift boxes
with spoons

00:16:16,002 --> 00:16:18,505
so they're ready to eat
right out of the package.

00:16:18,505 --> 00:16:21,074
Basically, they appeal
to anyone with a mouth.

00:16:21,074 --> 00:16:22,242
[ laughter ]

00:16:22,242 --> 00:16:24,444
We're not afraid
to work hard.

00:16:24,444 --> 00:16:27,647
Our days right now average 13
to 14 hours, plus.

00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:31,317
Mom's definitely getting
her fair share of time with me.

00:16:31,317 --> 00:16:33,787
So, which of you sharks
will be the first

00:16:33,787 --> 00:16:35,789
to sink your choppers
into our sweet deal?

00:16:35,789 --> 00:16:37,590
It's definitely a risk
worth taking.

00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:40,393
We found that there's a lot
of dough to be made from batter.

00:16:40,393 --> 00:16:42,695
[ laughter ]
BOTH: Thank you.

00:16:42,695 --> 00:16:44,764
We got to try it.
We got to try it.

00:16:44,764 --> 00:16:46,566
We actually have some
for you to try.

00:16:46,566 --> 00:16:48,201
They're wicked good.

00:16:48,201 --> 00:16:50,303
Danielle: They also have
a much better shelf life

00:16:50,303 --> 00:16:52,405
thanks to the jars.
[ laughs ]

00:16:52,405 --> 00:16:53,640
Harrington:
Can I have a "Jah"?

00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,008
is that -- "Jah"?
jar.

00:16:55,008 --> 00:16:56,142
I love your accent.

00:16:56,142 --> 00:16:58,978
O'Leary:
Where are you from?
Boston.

00:16:58,978 --> 00:17:00,013
The middle one's
for you.

00:17:00,013 --> 00:17:01,381
Thank you.
No problem.

00:17:01,381 --> 00:17:03,383
Cookies and cream
is for you.

00:17:03,383 --> 00:17:05,485
Oh, my God.
This is so good.

00:17:05,485 --> 00:17:07,687
Thank you, buttercup.
[ laughs ]

00:17:07,687 --> 00:17:10,456
Well, ladies, let me say,
welcome to the shark tank...

00:17:10,456 --> 00:17:11,891
thank you.
...from a fellow Bostonian.

00:17:11,891 --> 00:17:13,560
I live on Marlborough Street.

00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,161
Oh, I love
Marlborough Street!

00:17:15,161 --> 00:17:17,497
That is one damn good jar
of cake.

00:17:17,497 --> 00:17:18,731
It's the bomb, literally.

00:17:18,731 --> 00:17:21,100
Unbelievable. Look at this.
It's gone already.

00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,902
Here's another jar
for you, Mark.

00:17:22,902 --> 00:17:24,304
[ laughter ]

00:17:24,304 --> 00:17:25,405
You're killing me.

00:17:25,405 --> 00:17:26,973
How many have you sold
so far, Tracey?

00:17:26,973 --> 00:17:29,309
From January
of this year,

00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:32,846
we've sold $73,000
worth of jars.

00:17:32,846 --> 00:17:36,316
Our cupcake shop
has sold $150,000,

00:17:36,316 --> 00:17:39,552
including the $73,000
of the jars.

00:17:39,552 --> 00:17:41,221
So you have a store.

00:17:41,221 --> 00:17:44,958
We have a retail storefront,
as well, since october 2011.

00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:48,194
Are we being asked to invest
in the retail store

00:17:48,194 --> 00:17:49,929
and the jar cupcake company?

00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:51,397
We're actually offering
a piece of both...

00:17:51,397 --> 00:17:52,398
let me try yours.

00:17:52,398 --> 00:17:54,567
...the retail shop
as well as the jars.

00:17:54,567 --> 00:17:55,568
No.

00:17:55,568 --> 00:17:57,737
Basically,
our sales right now

00:17:57,737 --> 00:18:00,540
for this year
are slated to be $360,000.

00:18:02,542 --> 00:18:04,744
The growth potential that
we have discovered with these

00:18:04,744 --> 00:18:06,212
is phenomenal.

00:18:06,212 --> 00:18:07,280
Tracey, it's not patented.

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,514
Someone else
can put a cake in a jar

00:18:08,514 --> 00:18:09,983
and ship it
across the country.

00:18:09,983 --> 00:18:11,084
Absolutely,
they could.

00:18:11,084 --> 00:18:13,152
So tell me
what your plan is.

00:18:13,152 --> 00:18:15,455
How are you going to grow
this business quickly

00:18:15,455 --> 00:18:18,157
so that if I give you $75,000,
I get richer?

00:18:18,157 --> 00:18:19,525
That's all I care about.

00:18:19,525 --> 00:18:21,794
We want to be the Ben &amp; Jerry's
of cupcakes in a jar.

00:18:21,794 --> 00:18:23,630
How many days
is the shelf life of a jar?

00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,098
Seven to 10.

00:18:25,098 --> 00:18:26,532
Seven to 10.
So you've got bake it

00:18:26,532 --> 00:18:28,635
and sell it right away
and ship it,

00:18:28,635 --> 00:18:30,169
'cause it's gonna be
two days

00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:32,305
before It's
in somebody's mouth, right?
Correct.

00:18:32,305 --> 00:18:34,274
Have you talked to anybody
about extending the shelf life?

00:18:34,274 --> 00:18:35,842
'cause I know
it's something you can do.

00:18:35,842 --> 00:18:38,411
Yeah -- with preservatives.
You know, we --

00:18:38,411 --> 00:18:41,814
if you put preservatives in,
does it taste this wonderful?

00:18:41,814 --> 00:18:43,516
That's the exactly
the question --

00:18:43,516 --> 00:18:44,884
Will it alter the taste?

00:18:44,884 --> 00:18:47,520
What does each one cost to make,
and what do you sell them for?

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,290
The 8-Ounce jars
cost $2.15 to make.

00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:52,392
We retail that
for $5.95.

00:18:52,392 --> 00:18:55,395
The 16-Ounce jar
costs $3 to make,

00:18:55,395 --> 00:18:57,363
and we retail that
for $8.95.

00:18:57,363 --> 00:18:59,098
O'Leary: This product
will never be in retail.

00:18:59,098 --> 00:19:01,000
It's always going to be
an online.

00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,736
Somebody buys it, you bake it,
you send it overnight to them.

00:19:03,736 --> 00:19:05,738
Actually, we do have
some wholesale clients.

00:19:05,738 --> 00:19:08,675
We have a Coffee Company
up in Massachusetts.

00:19:08,675 --> 00:19:10,343
What are you charging her
a jar?

00:19:10,343 --> 00:19:12,512
We're charging her
$3 a jar.

00:19:12,512 --> 00:19:13,579
It's not enough margin
for you.

00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:15,381
Okay,
but here's the thing --

00:19:15,381 --> 00:19:18,651
We're buying in such
pathetic bulk right now.

00:19:18,651 --> 00:19:21,421
Okay, Tracey,
your best-case scenario --

00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:23,723
I give you
the $75,000.
Yep.

00:19:23,723 --> 00:19:26,292
Tell me
what your margins will be.
Sure.

00:19:26,292 --> 00:19:28,227
Right now it costs you $2.15
to make the small one

00:19:28,227 --> 00:19:29,529
and $3 for the big one.
Right.

00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:31,230
How much can you reduce
the cost?

00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:34,701
I believe we can get
the smaller jars down to $1.45.

00:19:34,701 --> 00:19:37,704
The question I have is --
On the Mason jars,

00:19:37,704 --> 00:19:40,373
are there any alternatives
that would allow you

00:19:40,373 --> 00:19:42,342
to reduce your costs
considerably?

00:19:42,342 --> 00:19:45,445
I got to say the Mason jars are
a really big draw for people.

00:19:45,445 --> 00:19:47,146
O'Leary: Exactly.
Greiner: You can see it.

00:19:47,146 --> 00:19:49,248
It's motherhood
and apple pie.
Exactly.

00:19:49,248 --> 00:19:52,085
It's a homemade product
in a crafty container.

00:19:52,085 --> 00:19:53,753
Right.
It suggests homemade, right?

00:19:53,753 --> 00:19:56,456
Exactly, and people
do say that to us.

00:19:56,456 --> 00:19:58,725
I don't think there's anything
wrong with your packaging.

00:19:58,725 --> 00:20:00,560
I just think you might need
a better supplier

00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,794
for the jar itself.

00:20:01,794 --> 00:20:03,863
Maybe you're not buying
at a big enough bulk.

00:20:03,863 --> 00:20:06,332
We need more money to buy
in bigger bulk -- Bottom line.

00:20:06,332 --> 00:20:07,600
That's why we're here.

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,205
Tracey, as you can tell,
I'm not a big dessert guy, so...

00:20:12,205 --> 00:20:13,806
you can pass yours
down this way.

00:20:13,806 --> 00:20:16,409
I know. This is really good.
It's carrot cake.
Pass that to Mark.

00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:18,578
There's definitely
a novelty aspect to it,

00:20:18,578 --> 00:20:21,014
because I've never heard of
a cupcake in a jar.

00:20:21,014 --> 00:20:23,850
So I think you can sell
some of those.

00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,318
How did you
like the product?

00:20:25,318 --> 00:20:27,253
It's too sweet for me.

00:20:27,253 --> 00:20:31,624
But I have concerns with
the retail and jar aspect of it,

00:20:31,624 --> 00:20:33,393
so for that reason,
I'm out.

00:20:33,393 --> 00:20:36,429
Okay. Well, thank you.
Danielle: Thank you.

00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:37,830
Robert's not
a big dessert eater.

00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,532
I am, and if I invest
in this company,

00:20:39,532 --> 00:20:42,101
I'll be a bigger and bigger
and bigger desert eater.
[ laughter ]

00:20:42,101 --> 00:20:45,505
and I'm afraid,
because I love the product.

00:20:45,505 --> 00:20:48,508
Well, we work there,
and we look pretty good.

00:20:48,508 --> 00:20:49,609
We'll limit you.

00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:51,677
I won't look the same.
Trust me.

00:20:51,677 --> 00:20:52,578
I'm out.

00:20:52,578 --> 00:20:54,814
Okay. Thank you.
Okay. Thank you.

00:20:54,814 --> 00:20:57,550
You know,
I have now tried three.

00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,018
They are fantastic.

00:20:59,018 --> 00:21:00,453
They are wicked good.

00:21:00,453 --> 00:21:04,090
The problem is it's just not
going to have a long shelf life,

00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,925
so for that reason, I'm out.

00:21:05,925 --> 00:21:07,794
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:21:07,794 --> 00:21:10,930
Cupcakes are super-Scorching
hot right now,

00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:13,466
and there's just so many people
going into this space.

00:21:13,466 --> 00:21:16,369
That's not really
where my specialty is,

00:21:16,369 --> 00:21:18,871
and I think you guys
are gonna do great things.

00:21:18,871 --> 00:21:20,873
But it's really not a fit
for me, so I'm out.

00:21:20,873 --> 00:21:22,842
Okay. Thank you.
Okay. Thank you.

00:21:23,876 --> 00:21:25,845
Come on, Mr. Wonderful.
[ laughs ]

00:21:25,845 --> 00:21:27,980
I'm gonna make you an offer.
You may not like it.

00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,716
I love the product.
I hate the margins.

00:21:30,716 --> 00:21:34,087
I'll give you the $75,000.
I don't want any equity.

00:21:34,087 --> 00:21:36,789
I want $1
from every jar.

00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:37,690
Oh.

00:21:39,092 --> 00:21:40,193
A dollar?

00:21:40,193 --> 00:21:42,228
Silence, please.
Let me get the offer out.

00:21:42,228 --> 00:21:46,632
I want $1 from every jar
until I get my $75,000 back,

00:21:46,632 --> 00:21:50,603
which means you have to sell
75,000 jars, all right?

00:21:50,603 --> 00:21:52,972
And then I want it to drop
to 50 cents in perpetuity.

00:21:52,972 --> 00:21:54,207
Whew.

00:21:54,207 --> 00:21:57,043
And you decide
what to do with the business.

00:21:58,678 --> 00:22:01,681
Can we just scoot out
in the hall for one second?

00:22:01,681 --> 00:22:03,649
Trust me. You're not gonna get a
worse offer than that.

00:22:03,649 --> 00:22:04,750
So you probably
should talk.

00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,852
Thank you.
We'll be right back.

00:22:05,852 --> 00:22:07,186
Thank you.
All right.

00:22:09,188 --> 00:22:11,090
Harrington: How much money
does that leave them with

00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,725
if they give you a dollar?

00:22:12,725 --> 00:22:13,960
Practically nothing.

00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,294
[ laughter ]

00:22:15,294 --> 00:22:16,596
Think of
what you're doing, Kevin.

00:22:16,596 --> 00:22:17,964
Hey, listen.

00:22:17,964 --> 00:22:19,232
This will give them incentive

00:22:19,232 --> 00:22:20,867
to figure
their margin problem out.

00:22:27,707 --> 00:22:28,708
[ laughs ]

00:22:33,446 --> 00:22:35,148
I like my deal,
and I'll sleep tonight

00:22:35,148 --> 00:22:36,949
with a cupcake beside me.

00:22:36,949 --> 00:22:38,284
[ laughter ]

00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,521
All right.

00:22:43,089 --> 00:22:45,558
So, Tracey, Danielle,
welcome back.

00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:47,193
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:22:47,193 --> 00:22:50,997
Four sharks were out, and
Mr. Wonderful made you an offer.

00:22:50,997 --> 00:22:54,767
He's giving you the $75,000,
but he wants no equity.

00:22:54,767 --> 00:22:59,438
He wants $1
off every cupcake jar

00:22:59,438 --> 00:23:01,908
until he gets paid back,

00:23:01,908 --> 00:23:05,144
and then 50 cents
from there on in

00:23:05,144 --> 00:23:07,246
until you can't bake
any more.

00:23:07,246 --> 00:23:08,514
[ chuckles ]

00:23:08,514 --> 00:23:10,850
Don't do a deal that could
cripple your business.

00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,251
Greiner:
I agree with him.

00:23:12,251 --> 00:23:14,720
Don't do something
that you'll regret afterwards.

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,257
Oh, Tracey,
talk is so cheap.

00:23:18,257 --> 00:23:20,960
Okay, we'd like
to come back to you

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,162
with 40 cents a jar
in perpetuity.

00:23:23,162 --> 00:23:24,530
Damn.

00:23:35,341 --> 00:23:36,676
45 cents, you have a deal.

00:23:38,077 --> 00:23:39,845
Come to mama.

00:23:39,845 --> 00:23:40,913
[ laughter ]

00:23:40,913 --> 00:23:42,081
[ groans ]

00:23:42,081 --> 00:23:43,683
Oh, my goodness.

00:23:43,683 --> 00:23:44,684
That's great.

00:23:44,684 --> 00:23:45,952
Thank you.
Harrington: Wow.

00:23:45,952 --> 00:23:47,086
O'Leary:
That's wonderful,

00:23:47,086 --> 00:23:48,454
and the product
really is fantastic.

00:23:48,454 --> 00:23:49,288
Get baking.

00:23:49,288 --> 00:23:50,823
Good luck.

00:23:50,823 --> 00:23:52,358
Congratulations.

00:23:52,358 --> 00:23:54,227
It was nice
meeting you.
Bye.

00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,967
I'm gonna be very happy.

00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:57,969
Mr. Wonderful
will see his return

00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:00,772
sooner than he thinks,
and we're just gonna do great.

00:24:13,361 --> 00:24:15,329
Narrator:
Next up is Aaron Lemieux,

00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:17,999
who's hoping to generate
lots of interest

00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:20,535
in his revolutionary
new product.

00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:29,210
Hello.
My name is Aaron Lemieux.

00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:30,978
My company is tremont electric,

00:24:30,978 --> 00:24:33,347
and I'm seeking
a $2 million investment

00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:36,450
for a 22% equity stake
in my company.
Whoa.

00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,852
Mm-hmm.

00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:41,756
Mobile electronic devices,
smartphones --

00:24:41,756 --> 00:24:45,693
It seems like our entire lives
are revolving around these days.

00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:47,762
But they have one fatal flaw --

00:24:47,762 --> 00:24:51,632
The batteries always run out
whenever we need them the most.

00:24:51,632 --> 00:24:53,968
But you don't need to worry
about that anymore.

00:24:53,968 --> 00:24:55,736
We have a technology
that allows us

00:24:55,736 --> 00:24:59,941
to harvest an energy
that's all around us.

00:24:59,941 --> 00:25:05,313
Introducing our first product --
The award-Winning npower Peg,

00:25:05,313 --> 00:25:08,482
the world's first
human-Powered charger

00:25:08,482 --> 00:25:10,718
for mobile electronic devices.

00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:12,687
This takes
your human walking Motion

00:25:12,687 --> 00:25:15,222
and turns it into the power
that you need.

00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,924
Simply place it inside of a bag

00:25:16,924 --> 00:25:19,160
and go about
your daily activities.

00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,496
The Peg stores your power
for when you need it the most --

00:25:22,496 --> 00:25:26,334
when you're out of power and
you're away from a wall outlet.

00:25:26,334 --> 00:25:29,003
With this investment
and the right partners,

00:25:29,003 --> 00:25:32,640
we'll be able to change
the way the WORLD makes energy.

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,642
Can I see it, Aaron?
Yes, sir.

00:25:34,642 --> 00:25:37,178
And all you have to do --
It's by motion. It has to move.

00:25:37,178 --> 00:25:39,413
You can't have it
sitting somewhere still.

00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:40,748
That is correct.

00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:42,383
How long does it hold
its power or energy?

00:25:42,383 --> 00:25:43,918
Hold its charge?
Yeah.

00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:46,220
That's actually
one of the interesting features

00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,555
of this product.

00:25:47,555 --> 00:25:50,891
Because it has a kinetic-Energy
generator built into it,

00:25:50,891 --> 00:25:54,662
it's continuously recharging
the battery that's inside of it.

00:25:54,662 --> 00:25:56,964
I see you have
a lot of patents up there.

00:25:56,964 --> 00:25:57,999
Yes, ma'am.

00:25:57,999 --> 00:25:59,333
Can you tell us
What those cover?

00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:02,269
They cover the BASIC
operating principles of this.

00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,838
So no one else can do it?

00:26:03,838 --> 00:26:05,072
That is correct.

00:26:05,072 --> 00:26:08,042
Aaron, I keep it
in my backpack or briefcase --

00:26:08,042 --> 00:26:09,644
Mm-hmm.

00:26:09,644 --> 00:26:12,947
How much power do I have there
after eight hours?

00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:14,715
Depending on how rapidly
you walk,

00:26:14,715 --> 00:26:17,418
you could have
up to a 20% recharge

00:26:17,418 --> 00:26:18,619
in your cellphone.

00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:19,587
So, who is this for?

00:26:19,587 --> 00:26:21,589
Is this for
the everyday person,

00:26:21,589 --> 00:26:25,626
or do you want this for hikers,
people in the wilderness,

00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:28,629
boaters, people
who are in positions

00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:30,765
where they really
may need energy?

00:26:30,765 --> 00:26:32,366
That is our initial
target market --

00:26:32,366 --> 00:26:34,068
people that have
a very compelling need

00:26:34,068 --> 00:26:36,937
to be able to have mobile power
When they need it,

00:26:36,937 --> 00:26:38,072
where they need it.

00:26:38,072 --> 00:26:39,473
What's the science
behind it?

00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:42,643
The science
is kinetic-Energy harvesting.

00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:46,881
The generator component --
We use the faraday effect,

00:26:46,881 --> 00:26:50,284
which is a magnet passing
through an induction Coil.

00:26:50,284 --> 00:26:53,120
How much do you sell them for,
and how many have you sold?

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,523
We sell them for $199.

00:26:55,523 --> 00:26:57,358
We've been selling them
through our web store,

00:26:57,358 --> 00:27:00,194
and we've sold 1,300 of them
up until this point.

00:27:00,194 --> 00:27:02,296
What does it cost you
to make them?

00:27:02,296 --> 00:27:04,131
It costs us
about $110 to make them.

00:27:04,131 --> 00:27:05,232
It's expensive.
It is.

00:27:05,232 --> 00:27:06,801
It was very much
a proof of concept,

00:27:06,801 --> 00:27:09,136
and it went out into the market.

00:27:09,136 --> 00:27:10,905
We needed to prove
that there is a market.

00:27:10,905 --> 00:27:13,407
For $2 million,
you better be selling me

00:27:13,407 --> 00:27:15,443
on where this is
in 10 or 15 years

00:27:15,443 --> 00:27:17,845
that's gonna revolutionize
the world

00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:20,848
instead of a backup battery
that goes on your phone.

00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:22,149
All right.

00:27:22,149 --> 00:27:24,552
What I plan on doing
to be able to change the world

00:27:24,552 --> 00:27:25,920
is this image right here.

00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,123
The reason why we have
the extensive patent portfolio,

00:27:29,123 --> 00:27:31,926
why we have a device and We've
commercialized something

00:27:31,926 --> 00:27:34,528
as a proof of concept
was because this technology

00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,330
applies to mass-Wave-Energy
power generation.

00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,398
So what you're saying --

00:27:37,398 --> 00:27:38,899
You're gonna put them
in the ocean,

00:27:38,899 --> 00:27:40,668
and you're gonna Harness
the power of waves.

00:27:40,668 --> 00:27:42,169
That is affirmative.

00:27:42,169 --> 00:27:46,941
From walking to wave --
Capturing energy from waves.

00:27:46,941 --> 00:27:48,642
Well, we've been able
to demonstrate

00:27:48,642 --> 00:27:50,377
that we can take
normal human walking

00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,813
and make usable power off of it.

00:27:52,813 --> 00:27:54,181
The exact same technology

00:27:54,181 --> 00:27:56,283
is able to do the same thing
in waves.

00:27:56,283 --> 00:27:59,220
Is it comparable to wind?
Is it better than solar?

00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,689
It's comparable to wind,
and the studies that we've done

00:28:01,689 --> 00:28:04,425
show that the power we could
produce from a wave farm

00:28:04,425 --> 00:28:06,827
would be price-comparable
to coal-Fired power.

00:28:06,827 --> 00:28:10,064
It seems to me that there are
at least three companies

00:28:10,064 --> 00:28:12,166
that are
in the turbine business

00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:14,869
that might be interested
in this technology.

00:28:14,869 --> 00:28:16,804
Why isn't all the energy
of this company

00:28:16,804 --> 00:28:19,540
to simply take these patents
and go and license it

00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,208
and prove this concept,

00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:23,711
which is ultimately
the best use of this technology?

00:28:23,711 --> 00:28:25,880
This is crap
compared to that.

00:28:27,014 --> 00:28:29,884
Why are wasting
with a little shake weight

00:28:29,884 --> 00:28:32,286
when you can go
and start in the water

00:28:32,286 --> 00:28:34,421
and start working
on smaller concepts there?

00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,323
It's a company.
We've got a product.

00:28:36,323 --> 00:28:37,758
So that's what it's about
right now --

00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:39,894
You're trying to create revenue
because you need the Revenue.

00:28:39,894 --> 00:28:41,462
Correct.
Okay. That's fair.

00:28:41,462 --> 00:28:46,867
The reality is you said you've
sold 1,300 of these at $199,

00:28:46,867 --> 00:28:50,437
so you've made $130,000
off of these things.

00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,606
You know, that's very,
very commendable.

00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:54,175
If you would have
walked in here

00:28:54,175 --> 00:28:56,177
and said, "Look at
this operating business.

00:28:56,177 --> 00:28:58,112
"I just made $130,000
in a few years.

00:28:58,112 --> 00:28:59,513
"This product's selling.

00:28:59,513 --> 00:29:01,782
"Help me get started,
and with your connections,

00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:05,986
let me tease you with this,"
I might have bitten.

00:29:05,986 --> 00:29:07,421
Okay.

00:29:07,421 --> 00:29:09,623
But when you try to sell us
on your plan

00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:11,025
and ask for $2 million,

00:29:11,025 --> 00:29:12,793
that's a different beast
altogether,

00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:14,161
so I have to
tell you I'm out.

00:29:16,564 --> 00:29:18,199
I think
you're brilliant.

00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:20,868
I hope that
you find a way

00:29:20,868 --> 00:29:22,937
in which to make
this dream come True.

00:29:22,937 --> 00:29:25,306
But I don't know
that I'm the right person

00:29:25,306 --> 00:29:29,610
to help you get to such a big,
global level.

00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:32,179
So for that reason,
I'm out,

00:29:32,179 --> 00:29:33,247
but I wish you
good luck.

00:29:33,247 --> 00:29:34,281
Thank you very much.

00:29:34,281 --> 00:29:36,483
Aaron, you know,
the only thing

00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:41,288
that I worry more about
than the debt in America

00:29:41,288 --> 00:29:44,258
is our consumption
of energy.

00:29:44,258 --> 00:29:45,626
Something's got to change.

00:29:45,626 --> 00:29:47,394
There's got to be
new technologies.

00:29:47,394 --> 00:29:49,396
There's got to be new ways
to create it.

00:29:49,396 --> 00:29:51,765
This could be part
of the answer --

00:29:51,765 --> 00:29:53,467
I don't really know --

00:29:53,467 --> 00:29:55,269
but I'm not making
the connection

00:29:55,269 --> 00:29:58,105
between this and that.

00:29:58,105 --> 00:30:02,243
I'm just not seeing it.
I'm out.

00:30:02,243 --> 00:30:04,678
Okay.

00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:08,749
Keep in mind, the strategy here
is crawl, walk, run.

00:30:08,749 --> 00:30:10,150
This is crawling.

00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,219
We have other business
development opportunities

00:30:12,219 --> 00:30:14,421
that are in our pipeline
that are actually starting

00:30:14,421 --> 00:30:16,257
to create revenue
at this point, too,

00:30:16,257 --> 00:30:17,925
like the military application --

00:30:17,925 --> 00:30:19,360
Being able to reduce
the battery weight

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,663
of soldiers in combat by 25%
by harvesting the power

00:30:22,663 --> 00:30:24,398
that already exists
on the battlefield.

00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:27,301
John: You're a smart guy.
I can't add value.

00:30:27,301 --> 00:30:29,770
I'm just not excited
about it.

00:30:30,771 --> 00:30:31,639
I'm out.

00:30:31,639 --> 00:30:33,173
Thank you.

00:30:33,173 --> 00:30:35,709
Well, I think at this point,
four sharks are out

00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:37,478
and only Kevin is left.

00:30:37,478 --> 00:30:39,580
Okay, Aaron, you know,
as far as I'm concerned,

00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:42,149
you've proven
the concept.

00:30:42,149 --> 00:30:44,652
Whether or not this is
a successful retail product

00:30:44,652 --> 00:30:47,087
is irrelevant
when that's the prize.

00:30:47,087 --> 00:30:49,423
And I think it's
very interesting technology.

00:30:49,423 --> 00:30:51,659
If it's true,
if you have some proof

00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:54,461
that this is equivalent to
the efficiency of burning coal,

00:30:54,461 --> 00:30:57,231
this is obviously
a better solution.

00:30:57,231 --> 00:30:59,433
So what I would have
liked to have done

00:30:59,433 --> 00:31:01,335
is said,
"I'll get on board.

00:31:01,335 --> 00:31:03,370
I'll buy a piece
of this company,

00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:04,738
and I'll take it to g.E."

00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:07,808
But I can't play,

00:31:07,808 --> 00:31:12,646
'cause it costs me $2 million
so that I can work for you.

00:31:12,646 --> 00:31:14,815
How twisted is that?

00:31:14,815 --> 00:31:17,318
Sounds like America
to me.
No.

00:31:17,318 --> 00:31:20,220
It sounds like
you made a mistake to me.

00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:23,757
I'm not gonna pay you $2 million
and then do the heavy lifting.

00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:25,326
That's insane.

00:31:25,326 --> 00:31:27,127
That's un-American.

00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:29,930
I'm out.

00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,932
Okay.
All the best.

00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:33,667
Thank you all very much
for your time.

00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:35,669
I really do appreciate it.

00:31:39,907 --> 00:31:41,008
I think
he's got something.

00:31:41,008 --> 00:31:42,276
I hope he makes it.

00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:43,544
Yeah, I do too.

00:31:43,544 --> 00:31:46,146
I feel strongly
that we're on the right path,

00:31:46,146 --> 00:31:47,448
we're doing the right stuff

00:31:47,448 --> 00:31:49,817
and we're gonna be growing
our clean technology

00:31:49,817 --> 00:31:52,419
into a multibillion-dollar
company.

00:32:04,331 --> 00:32:07,167
Narrator: Next into the tank
is Nathan Holdsaffle,

00:32:07,167 --> 00:32:10,437
with a new twist
to a common men's accessory.

00:32:16,176 --> 00:32:18,045
Hi, sharks.
I'm Nate Holdsaffle.

00:32:18,045 --> 00:32:20,381
And I'm founder
of the Mission Belt Company,

00:32:20,381 --> 00:32:22,616
and we're seeking $50,000
in exchange for 20% equity

00:32:22,616 --> 00:32:23,951
in our company.

00:32:23,951 --> 00:32:26,320
Everyone owns a belt --
Most people own a few --

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,956
and in a thousand years,
this everyday accessory

00:32:28,956 --> 00:32:30,491
Has hardly ever changed.

00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:32,626
And some people might ask,
"Why reinvent the wheel?"

00:32:32,626 --> 00:32:35,329
at the mission belt company,
we've asked, "Why not?"

00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:38,065
so we set on a mission to
improve this everyday accessory.

00:32:38,065 --> 00:32:40,401
For starters...

00:32:40,401 --> 00:32:41,301
careful.

00:32:42,436 --> 00:32:44,204
...we removed all the holes.

00:32:44,204 --> 00:32:46,373
We've also employed
our unique ratchet system

00:32:46,373 --> 00:32:48,008
to allow it to go together.

00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:51,145
You can hear the clicks
as it goes together, feeds...

00:32:51,145 --> 00:32:52,513
[ clicking ]
...slowly,

00:32:52,513 --> 00:32:55,049
and use the release lever
on the bottom to take it apart.

00:32:55,049 --> 00:32:57,418
It's like a giant zip tie
for your pants.

00:32:57,418 --> 00:32:59,186
Now, sharks,
I'm a big, husky guy,

00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:02,089
and keeping my pants on
is a full-time job, okay?

00:33:02,089 --> 00:33:04,258
[ laughter ]
I wear out so many belts.

00:33:04,258 --> 00:33:06,160
I wear all kinds of belts.

00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,761
It is for Kevin, also.

00:33:07,761 --> 00:33:09,229
[ laughter ]

00:33:09,229 --> 00:33:11,632
Okay, O'Leary, we got something
in common. That's good.

00:33:11,632 --> 00:33:14,134
Keeping up my pants
is a full-time job

00:33:14,134 --> 00:33:15,436
because I wear them out so quick

00:33:15,436 --> 00:33:17,438
and the holes
are what cause the problem.

00:33:17,438 --> 00:33:20,674
Regardless of my caloric intake,
the mission belt's gonna give me

00:33:20,674 --> 00:33:23,710
the perfect fit every time,
and it's gonna last a long time.

00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,979
Sharks, with your help,

00:33:25,979 --> 00:33:27,815
I believe I could put
one of these belts

00:33:27,815 --> 00:33:30,651
around the waist
of everyone in America.

00:33:30,651 --> 00:33:32,352
Let's make a deal.

00:33:32,352 --> 00:33:34,755
Is that all it does
is ratchet on?
Yep.

00:33:34,755 --> 00:33:36,323
Can we see them?
Sure.

00:33:36,323 --> 00:33:38,859
Harrington:
Thank you.

00:33:40,627 --> 00:33:42,062
Oh, it's well made.

00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:43,530
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:45,299
It's very well made.

00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:46,900
Do you manufacture
these, Nate?

00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,901
I sure do.

00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:49,269
Yourself, or do you --

00:33:49,269 --> 00:33:51,805
No, I actually employ
a factory to do it.

00:33:51,805 --> 00:33:53,907
This is as high a quality belt
as I could make

00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:55,609
and still make it
comfortable price.

00:33:55,609 --> 00:33:57,744
But nobody can make a belt
just like the mission belt.

00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:01,381
Our unique style, our design,
and frankly, the quality

00:34:01,381 --> 00:34:03,417
and the effort we put together
to make these belts

00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:04,751
is unique and special.

00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,320
What's the distribution
plan?

00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,388
How are you gonna get this
in every store

00:34:08,388 --> 00:34:10,457
where Men's and Women's clothes
are sold?

00:34:10,457 --> 00:34:13,360
That's exactly my biggest Hurdle
that I'm gonna have.

00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,295
I need a rolodex.

00:34:15,295 --> 00:34:16,430
I'm a good salesman,

00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,931
but I can't get in front
of the right people.

00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:20,534
Tell us about the stores
you're selling in right now.

00:34:20,534 --> 00:34:22,035
They're small, local retailers.

00:34:22,035 --> 00:34:23,537
I'm in a couple
of country clubs,

00:34:23,537 --> 00:34:25,105
a couple
of men's clothier places,

00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:27,040
and really,
it's the number-one-selling belt

00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,208
in each of these locations.

00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:30,577
What are they
reordering?

00:34:30,577 --> 00:34:32,980
Is it because they're selling
three a week or 20 or 30

00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,715
or you're really
doing well?

00:34:34,715 --> 00:34:35,916
The orders are going up.

00:34:35,916 --> 00:34:37,484
I have one location
that sells 250 a month.

00:34:37,484 --> 00:34:39,486
250 belts a month?
Greiner: A month?

00:34:39,486 --> 00:34:41,522
In one location out of those 22.

00:34:41,522 --> 00:34:43,257
What does it sell for?

00:34:43,257 --> 00:34:44,358
35 bucks.

00:34:44,358 --> 00:34:45,659
How much have you made
last year?

00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:47,828
We've only been in business
for three months.

00:34:47,828 --> 00:34:50,731
How much have you sold?
$39,000 worth of product.

00:34:50,731 --> 00:34:51,765
In three months?
Yep.

00:34:51,765 --> 00:34:53,433
Pretty darn good
for belts.

00:34:53,433 --> 00:34:54,902
John:
That is really Good.
Wow.

00:34:54,902 --> 00:34:57,137
What's it cost to make them,
and what are you wholesaling
them for?

00:34:57,137 --> 00:35:00,107
Right now, even in the small
quantities I'm building them,

00:35:00,107 --> 00:35:02,843
I can build them for anywhere
from about $5.50 to $6,

00:35:02,843 --> 00:35:04,912
shipped here in the U.S.
With a tag.

00:35:04,912 --> 00:35:06,813
And what's your wholesale?
$15.

00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,081
$15?
Mm-hmm.

00:35:08,081 --> 00:35:10,317
Margins are okay.
Margins are good.

00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:12,953
The biggest challenge
is the demonstration of that.

00:35:12,953 --> 00:35:16,023
If it's just hanging there,
we have no idea what it was.

00:35:16,023 --> 00:35:17,824
We were all looking at it,

00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,626
and you don't
hear the ratcheting.

00:35:19,626 --> 00:35:20,861
You don't understand it.

00:35:20,861 --> 00:35:23,864
How do I walk into a store,
see that display,

00:35:23,864 --> 00:35:26,934
see mission belt --
How do I know it does that?

00:35:26,934 --> 00:35:29,870
What I've gone ahead and done
in these 22 locations

00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:31,872
is I've taken
some Real personal effort

00:35:31,872 --> 00:35:33,106
and I've gone to each one
of them,

00:35:33,106 --> 00:35:34,408
and I pay attention
to the salespeople.

00:35:34,408 --> 00:35:36,009
"Hi. How are you?
My name's nate."

00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:38,378
"And Here's a belt."
"Here's a belt.
You want to try one on?"

00:35:38,378 --> 00:35:40,314
I have every salesperson
who sells them wear them.

00:35:40,314 --> 00:35:42,983
The reality of it is, once you
wear one of these belts,

00:35:42,983 --> 00:35:45,652
it's really hard to consider
anything else for the pants,

00:35:45,652 --> 00:35:47,788
because it adjusts
to every quarter-Inch.

00:35:47,788 --> 00:35:50,390
A lot of belts, it's like
it fits and then it doesn't.

00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:52,459
Especially for big guys.
I weigh 250, man.

00:35:52,459 --> 00:35:53,860
You don't want to buy
a 42-Inch.

00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,062
I lost 10 pounds
last week,

00:35:55,062 --> 00:35:56,797
and I might gain 10 pounds
tomorrow

00:35:56,797 --> 00:35:59,299
because I'm in l.A.
And I love food.
[ laughter ]

00:35:59,299 --> 00:36:01,468
the reality of it is
that my belt will fit.

00:36:01,468 --> 00:36:02,936
And it always broadcasts
to the world

00:36:02,936 --> 00:36:04,805
how much weight you've gained
or lost or whatever.

00:36:04,805 --> 00:36:06,039
This belt doesn't show any wear.

00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:07,808
When I decided I wanted
to try to sell these,

00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,643
I thought,
"I'm gonna do a test market."

00:36:09,643 --> 00:36:12,879
And I went out
to a local swap meet.

00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,848
I took 100 belts with me.

00:36:14,848 --> 00:36:17,017
Two hours later,
the belts were gone,

00:36:17,017 --> 00:36:18,585
and I knew
at that point right there

00:36:18,585 --> 00:36:20,487
that I had something unique
and special.

00:36:20,487 --> 00:36:23,624
I sold some Belts door-To-Door
here in west hollywood.

00:36:23,624 --> 00:36:24,891
I want to say
it was saturday night.

00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,594
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You came to L.A.

00:36:27,594 --> 00:36:29,329
And one of
the first things you did

00:36:29,329 --> 00:36:30,897
when you get
to Los Angeles --

00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,532
I check in,
got nothing else to do,

00:36:32,532 --> 00:36:33,533
evening to myself.

00:36:33,533 --> 00:36:35,402
I went and sold 20 belts
door-to-door.

00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:37,704
I love you.
I love you!

00:36:37,704 --> 00:36:39,640
Are their any other ones
like this?

00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,841
There are.
There are?

00:36:40,841 --> 00:36:42,976
Holdsaffle: Yeah, there's
products that are like it.

00:36:42,976 --> 00:36:44,311
It's called a t-Belt.

00:36:44,311 --> 00:36:46,079
But, Lori,
they don't ratchet like this.

00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,749
No, they don't ratchet,
which is why I'm saying --

00:36:48,749 --> 00:36:50,717
the t-Belt's where
they just get snug, right?

00:36:50,717 --> 00:36:51,918
John:
Yeah, the army ones.

00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,421
But they never work properly
over time.

00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:56,423
They sure don't,
and lot of times, too,

00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:58,091
a nylon belt's really cool,

00:36:58,091 --> 00:37:00,594
but I wouldn't wear a nylon belt
with anything you're wearing.

00:37:00,594 --> 00:37:03,664
I think it's very tough
to actually get distribution

00:37:03,664 --> 00:37:05,699
of just five
or six belts.

00:37:05,699 --> 00:37:07,134
But with the right person
as a partner,

00:37:07,134 --> 00:37:08,335
with the right rolodex --

00:37:08,335 --> 00:37:09,870
I'm not asking anyone
to sell this belt for me.

00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,371
We don't need to hire
a sales force.

00:37:11,371 --> 00:37:13,073
I am a sales force.
We can go out and do this.

00:37:13,073 --> 00:37:14,141
I love him.

00:37:14,141 --> 00:37:15,942
What I need is to get
the appointments.

00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:18,679
With the right names
and the right references,

00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:19,980
I can get in front
of these places.

00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,415
Right now I bat 1.000.

00:37:21,415 --> 00:37:25,986
Everybody who I pitch the belt
to who can make a decision buys.

00:37:25,986 --> 00:37:28,422
I think you're great.
You're a hero.

00:37:28,422 --> 00:37:30,791
It's very innovative.
I like it a lot.

00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:34,261
And I think that men could use
a product like this.

00:37:34,261 --> 00:37:36,730
The only problem
is I see this product

00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:39,533
as something that really
needs to be demonstrated,

00:37:39,533 --> 00:37:42,736
and I think it would be
difficult to show it in,

00:37:42,736 --> 00:37:45,105
let's say, jcpenney
in 1,000-Plus stores.

00:37:45,105 --> 00:37:46,440
You're not gonna get
the sales force

00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,942
to be able to talk about it
enough,

00:37:48,942 --> 00:37:52,679
because there's hundreds
of products per floor.

00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:55,482
So for that reason,
I'm out.

00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:57,484
No problem. Thank you very much
for your opinion.

00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:59,853
I appreciate it.

00:37:59,853 --> 00:38:02,155
I like the product.

00:38:03,423 --> 00:38:06,259
I think this is
a big distribution play.

00:38:06,259 --> 00:38:08,095
I think it will sell
wherever it goes.

00:38:08,095 --> 00:38:10,764
Getting it into the stores is
gonna be a significant challenge

00:38:10,764 --> 00:38:14,935
that I'm not up for,
but I will buy one from you.

00:38:14,935 --> 00:38:18,205
I like the product a lot.
I'm gonna use it.

00:38:18,205 --> 00:38:19,439
But I'm out.

00:38:21,241 --> 00:38:23,477
Is there a problem at all
if someone's really skinny

00:38:23,477 --> 00:38:26,079
where there's just
too much belt hanging over?
No.

00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:27,581
I know you don't have
that problem.

00:38:27,581 --> 00:38:29,449
I don't have that problem,
but there are some.

00:38:29,449 --> 00:38:30,784
It's actually a cool feature.

00:38:30,784 --> 00:38:32,586
My son Lorenzo
is 4 1/2 years old.

00:38:32,586 --> 00:38:34,121
He's a little guy.
He's skinny.

00:38:34,121 --> 00:38:35,756
And he wanted a mission belt.

00:38:35,756 --> 00:38:36,890
You take the belts off.

00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:38,759
The Buckles
are totally interchangeable.

00:38:38,759 --> 00:38:40,560
But how do you
make it smaller?

00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,828
Cut it down.

00:38:41,828 --> 00:38:44,164
I guess it doesn't matter.
The ends don't matter, right?

00:38:44,164 --> 00:38:46,032
Sure. You can make it
as small as you want.

00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:48,001
But if you're in a men's store,
if you're thin,

00:38:48,001 --> 00:38:50,003
you're not gonna
want to cut a belt.

00:38:50,003 --> 00:38:51,405
We have different sizes,
though.

00:38:51,405 --> 00:38:53,473
We have small, medium, large,
and extra large right now.

00:38:55,175 --> 00:38:57,310
You know, for me,
it's a pure licensing play.

00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:59,279
And I'm open to licensing.

00:38:59,279 --> 00:39:02,048
I'm not a person
who has an agenda.

00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,917
I want to get things done.
I want to make things work.

00:39:03,917 --> 00:39:06,219
The thing about it
is that in the end of the day,

00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:07,554
it's not just $50,000.

00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:09,790
I do need that rolodex,
and I need financial depth.

00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:12,092
Well, I think everybody here
can give you the rolodex.

00:39:12,092 --> 00:39:14,327
Everybody here can give you
the financial depth,

00:39:14,327 --> 00:39:17,431
but I think if you want to sell
belts to other stores,

00:39:17,431 --> 00:39:18,965
I'm probably
not your partner.

00:39:18,965 --> 00:39:20,133
I'm out.

00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,804
How much did you say
you invested?

00:39:23,804 --> 00:39:25,405
Right now,
we're about $90,000.

00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:27,307
You don't have any debt,
no big credit cards backed up?

00:39:27,307 --> 00:39:29,443
No credit cards.
I sold my car to do belts.

00:39:29,443 --> 00:39:31,678
I'm eating peanut Butter
and jelly sandwiches.

00:39:31,678 --> 00:39:32,979
It's not as bad as ketchup.

00:39:32,979 --> 00:39:35,048
Ketchup and Mustard is good.
You ought to try it sometime.

00:39:35,048 --> 00:39:37,017
I'm not that desperate yet,
but coming up on it soon.

00:39:37,017 --> 00:39:38,385
Right now it's pb&amp;js.

00:39:38,385 --> 00:39:40,420
But just doing my part
to try and Make things work.

00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,255
I'm a person who's patient,
reasonable,

00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:44,057
and I want to
make something happen.

00:39:44,057 --> 00:39:46,226
So three sharks are out.

00:39:46,226 --> 00:39:49,362
Mark and Daymond,
what are you going to do?

00:40:03,261 --> 00:40:05,030
Narrator:
Three sharks are out.

00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:09,167
Daymond and Mark are Nathan's
last chance to make a deal.

00:40:09,167 --> 00:40:10,836
You're impressive.
Very impressive guy.

00:40:10,836 --> 00:40:13,004
So let me
enlighten you.

00:40:13,004 --> 00:40:16,675
Accessories are
the hottest thing selling now,

00:40:16,675 --> 00:40:20,745
But just one design of a belt
is not a business.

00:40:20,745 --> 00:40:21,980
Holdsaffle: Right.
Right?

00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,348
That's for sure.

00:40:23,348 --> 00:40:24,783
That's the biggest
challenge,

00:40:24,783 --> 00:40:26,518
but I'm really impressed
by you.

00:40:26,518 --> 00:40:28,220
Getting off the plane and
walking around West Hollywood

00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,354
and selling belts
door-to-door --

00:40:29,354 --> 00:40:31,189
Cuban:
And let me just say,

00:40:31,189 --> 00:40:34,593
I relate to that, because I sold
garbage bags door-to-door.

00:40:34,593 --> 00:40:35,894
I sold candy
door-to-door.

00:40:35,894 --> 00:40:37,395
I sold greeting cards
door-to-door.
Yeah.

00:40:37,395 --> 00:40:38,897
I sold magazines
door-to-door.

00:40:38,897 --> 00:40:41,233
You name it, I sold it.
Takes guts.

00:40:41,233 --> 00:40:42,701
No, it just takes
confidence.

00:40:42,701 --> 00:40:45,537
So, what are you gonna do?

00:40:46,905 --> 00:40:48,006
Are you doing something?

00:40:48,006 --> 00:40:50,008
I'm patient.

00:40:50,008 --> 00:40:51,576
Oh, you want to wait
for me?

00:40:51,576 --> 00:40:53,078
Exactly.
Okay. No problem.

00:40:53,078 --> 00:40:54,913
John:
Doing this offer,

00:40:54,913 --> 00:40:57,215
I would really want it to be
for a license reason,

00:40:57,215 --> 00:40:59,284
but the biggest challenge
with that is

00:40:59,284 --> 00:41:00,886
you're the best salesman.

00:41:00,886 --> 00:41:02,521
So we would have to
do something

00:41:02,521 --> 00:41:04,222
where we license it
to a company,

00:41:04,222 --> 00:41:07,526
but you also do sales
and you're the head of sales

00:41:07,526 --> 00:41:11,363
and you get a commission
for that as well.

00:41:11,363 --> 00:41:13,131
I will make you
an offer...

00:41:14,766 --> 00:41:19,638
...for $50,000
and 40% of the company.

00:41:19,638 --> 00:41:22,407
We're gonna take it, obviously,
to a license guy,

00:41:22,407 --> 00:41:24,342
a partner of mine,

00:41:24,342 --> 00:41:26,044
and they're gonna do
all the manufacturing,

00:41:26,044 --> 00:41:28,113
product development,

00:41:28,113 --> 00:41:29,915
and you'll also
head up the sales team.

00:41:30,982 --> 00:41:32,183
That's my offer.

00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,055
Take his offer.
I'm out.

00:41:39,891 --> 00:41:41,626
Would you settle for 30%?

00:41:41,626 --> 00:41:44,696
I will absolutely settle
for 37.5%.

00:41:48,166 --> 00:41:51,169
Daymond, I'd be crazy
to not want a partner like you.

00:41:51,169 --> 00:41:52,737
I accept 100%.

00:41:52,737 --> 00:41:54,172
My man.
[ cracks belt ]

00:41:54,172 --> 00:41:55,840
Harrington: Wow.
That's a deal.

00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,509
That is a deal.
What a dream come true
for me.

00:41:57,509 --> 00:41:58,510
Thank you.

00:41:58,510 --> 00:41:59,778
Thank you so much.

00:41:59,778 --> 00:42:01,212
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

00:42:01,212 --> 00:42:02,314
[ laughs ]

00:42:03,915 --> 00:42:05,784
Congratulations.

00:42:05,784 --> 00:42:08,787
[ laughs ]

00:42:08,787 --> 00:42:11,356
I'm happier about being
in business with him.
You should be.

00:42:11,356 --> 00:42:13,024
Yeah, he's gonna call me
every morning

00:42:13,024 --> 00:42:15,226
and say, "Hey, why don't you
get up and do something?"

00:42:15,226 --> 00:42:18,563
I was able to get a deal
with Daymond, of all people --

00:42:18,563 --> 00:42:19,664
Just so lucky.

00:42:19,664 --> 00:42:21,533
I couldn't have dreamt it
any better.

00:42:21,533 --> 00:42:22,968
It's just absolutely wonderful.
