in an all-new season
of "Shark Tank,"

00:00:04,637 --> 00:00:06,872

dream of a chance
to secure an investment

00:00:09,742 --> 00:00:11,644

00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:14,814

00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:21,053
If the sharks hear
a great idea,

00:00:21,053 --> 00:00:24,023
they're ready to invest
using their own money.

00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:26,726
Have you put up
any of your money?
(exhales) Thousands.

00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:29,695
And they'll fight each other
for a piece of the action.

00:00:29,695 --> 00:00:31,964
Kevin, he can't just sell
chopping blocks. That's boring.

00:00:31,964 --> 00:00:33,699
Why not?

I forbid you to talk
about this topic anymore.

00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:38,037
But first, the entrepreneurs
must convince a shark

to invest the full amount
they're asking for,

00:00:40,906 --> 00:00:42,742
or they'll walk away
with Nothing.

00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:44,844
Guys, I really do need a deal.
I can't leave without a deal.

It's sink...

gonna do?

any other offers.

Thanks to the boom
of small, local coffee shops,

00:02:49,835 --> 00:02:51,904
we've all learned
it's the independent

artisan coffee roaster
that seeks out

00:02:54,506 --> 00:02:57,509
the world's best beans
and artfully roasts a product

to anything you could find

00:02:59,478 --> 00:03:02,715

These coffees were grown

Guatemala, Ethiopia,
and Tanzania,

00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:14,386
then they were sourced

all right?
(Samantha) Great.

00:04:18,624 --> 00:04:20,826
I'm trying it. It's delicious.
I'm a coffee drinker.

00:04:20,826 --> 00:04:23,562
What's the cost of acquiring
me as your customer?

00:04:23,562 --> 00:04:25,597
Because I've never heard
of you before,

00:04:25,597 --> 00:04:27,800
but I may be a customer.
How are you gonna get me?

00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,703
So, so far, our cost
of customer acquisition

00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,604
has been $4.60.

00:04:32,604 --> 00:04:35,374
Oh, you know that number?

00:04:35,374 --> 00:04:36,709
Yes, we do.
It's very rare
that somebody

00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,444
with an online strategy
walks in here

00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,611
and knows that number.
Yep.

00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:40,779
You get special
bonus points for that.
Very good.

00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:42,448
I will take another
sip then.
Great.

We're from
Scottsdale, Arizona.

00:04:45,684 --> 00:04:47,453
Okay. How'd you get
into this?

00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,422
So, we actually met
at the University of Arizona,

00:04:50,422 --> 00:04:51,623
and we started the company

00:04:51,623 --> 00:04:52,791
out of
the entrepreneurship program.

00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,426
Are you dating?
We are not.

00:04:54,426 --> 00:04:55,627
No, we're not dating.
Just friends.

00:04:55,627 --> 00:04:56,695
Did you ever date?
No, we didn't.

00:04:56,695 --> 00:04:58,430
Never dated.

00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,765
How would I hear about you?
Where are you targeting me?

00:04:59,765 --> 00:05:03,635
So right now we're really
targeting the coffee community

00:05:03,635 --> 00:05:05,371
and the foodie community.

00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:07,706
We were surprised to find
that the foodie-type people,

00:05:07,706 --> 00:05:10,476
not just the coffee people,
were really receptive to us,

00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,345
because they really want
to learn more about coffee.

00:05:13,345 --> 00:05:15,547
So we're targeting the bloggers,

00:05:15,547 --> 00:05:17,649
all of the different
publications.
All right, so grassroots.

00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:18,784
Yeah.
Exactly.

00:05:18,784 --> 00:05:20,419
Walk me through
the pricing model.

00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:22,654
I hear about you.
I say, "Mistobox."

00:05:22,654 --> 00:05:24,423
Right. So you can go back
online...
okay.

00:05:24,423 --> 00:05:25,557
And we have three different
subscriptions,

00:05:25,557 --> 00:05:27,326
and then three different
gift subscriptions.

00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:29,328
Yep, just Mistobox.Com.
What do they range
in price?

00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:31,697
They range $15
for a monthly subscription

00:05:31,697 --> 00:05:33,532
and $14 for 6-month
subscription

00:05:33,532 --> 00:05:35,667
and $12.50 for
a year-long subscription.

00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:38,370
And then what do I--
how do you charge me more?

00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,539
So, if you get
a year-long subscription,

00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:42,574
you pay $150 on day 1,

00:05:42,574 --> 00:05:43,709
and then that equates
to $12.50 a month

00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:45,310
and you get that
for the full year,

00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,346
and then at the end
of the year,

00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:49,348
you're recurrently billed
for the following year.
There's no other cost?

00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:50,716
Whether I keep it, send it
back, there's--That's it?
No matter what you do.

00:05:50,716 --> 00:05:52,484
And if you get
a monthly subscription,

00:05:52,484 --> 00:05:53,786
it's recurring billing
until you cancel.

00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:55,754
And on that $150--
Let's work with that example.
Right.

00:05:55,754 --> 00:05:58,390
So it's $150.
I paid you up front.

00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,526
What's your margin on that
over the year?

00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,694
So our margin is anywhere
from about 30% to 45%,

00:06:02,694 --> 00:06:04,596
and we get the coffee
from the roasters

00:06:04,596 --> 00:06:06,598
at a steep, steep discount
or for free.

00:06:06,598 --> 00:06:08,434
How are they giving it
to you for free?
(Mark) So then--Yeah.

00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:10,402
Why would they give it
to you for free?
We're a sampling department.

00:06:10,402 --> 00:06:11,537
Because we are putting
their product

00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,338
in the hands
of prequalified consumers

00:06:13,338 --> 00:06:14,606
that want to try new coffees.

00:06:14,606 --> 00:06:16,508
So, the advantage
to the coffee guys is,

00:06:16,508 --> 00:06:18,310
I can't get my coffee
out there.

00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,513
You're offering me
a distribution channel.
(both) Exactly.

00:06:21,513 --> 00:06:24,249
And the hope for me
as a coffee guy

00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:27,319
is that Lori will start
buying my coffee.
(both) Exactly.

00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:29,254
Is that right?
Right.

00:06:29,254 --> 00:06:30,689
Does a time come
when I, the customer, says,

00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:33,559
"Oh, that coffee from Ethiopia
is all I care about"?

00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:36,562
you know--
"That's all I want.
Just ship me that.

00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,497

the Mistobox coming every month.

00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,469
Mr. Wonderful, as long
as you stay our customer,

we're happy.
We'll send you

your favorite coffee
on your schedule.

00:06:46,705 --> 00:06:48,674
So say you want it
every two weeks, every week--
Yeah, well,
that's what you said.

the recurring schedule you want,

00:06:54,513 --> 00:06:56,248

so it's an auto-delivery.

It's an auto-delivery.
auto-delivery every month.

Yeah. And you can switch

There's no commitment.
'cause your margins--

00:07:02,187 --> 00:07:03,522
What percentage convert
from that?

00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:05,257
They start on the sampler box.

00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:06,425
What percentage go
to the full-Time--
We have about--

00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:08,260
right now, we have about
15% of our customers

00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,262
coming back online
and ordering coffee.

00:07:10,262 --> 00:07:11,597
So we have
two revenue streams--

00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,298
Both from the subscription

00:07:13,298 --> 00:07:15,200
and from the return online
sales.

00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,368
How long have you
been in business,

00:07:16,368 --> 00:07:17,569
and what have you done
to date?

00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:19,338
Yes, so we've been operating
for about four months now,

00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:20,506
going into our fifth month.

00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,508
And we have a growth chart
here for you guys.

00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,309
We just hit
our 700 customer Mark.

00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:27,513
So in the past 21 days,
we've grown by 370%

00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:30,282
and about, uh,
551 customers.
So, Connor, when you say

00:07:30,282 --> 00:07:32,518
"Customers," can I assume
that those 700 people

00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:35,254
are buying some type
of subscription?

00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:36,588
Exactly.
Yes, they're buying
a subscription...

00:07:36,588 --> 00:07:38,257
(Robert) Okay.
Whether it's a monthly,
6-Month, or annual.

00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:39,591

familiar with kickstarter?

00:07:41,426 --> 00:07:43,362
Sure. Yeah.
We had a successful
kickstarter campaign

00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:45,330
where we raised just over
$9,000.

00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,332
That's what kind of
kickstarted us,

00:07:47,332 --> 00:07:49,501

about $6,000 of our own money.

00:07:49,501 --> 00:07:51,537

It's just us two.

(Robert) So, Mike--Mike D.,
just to be clear,

00:15:37,174 --> 00:15:38,375
I'm sitting in my house.
Yes.

00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,510
I see the little squirrel
eating.
Yes.

00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:43,246
I think he's had too much.
I zap him?

00:15:43,246 --> 00:15:44,381
That's the whole thing.

00:15:44,381 --> 00:15:45,515
When I said
"Wears out his welcome"--

00:15:45,515 --> 00:15:47,217
because squirrels need
to eat, too.

00:15:47,217 --> 00:15:49,119
But that means I have to be
watching the bird feed--

00:15:49,119 --> 00:15:50,587
That's
our second-Biggest objection

00:15:50,587 --> 00:15:53,523
that I get all of the time
in public and--

00:15:53,523 --> 00:15:55,158
What's the first?
That you have to be watching--

00:15:55,158 --> 00:15:57,260
It's too expensive,
and that's why I'm here.

00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,297
I have a question. Let's say
the squirrel, named Joe...

00:16:00,297 --> 00:16:02,432
(chuckles)
goes on, gets zapped.

00:16:02,432 --> 00:16:05,335
Does Joe then never
come back again?

00:16:05,335 --> 00:16:07,070
And how many shocks
can Joe take?

00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,371
No, excellent question,
Lori.

00:16:08,371 --> 00:16:11,274
Um... it gets Boring
really fast.

00:16:11,274 --> 00:16:13,343
Boring?
Boring, meaning he won't
touch it after two shocks.

00:16:13,343 --> 00:16:15,112
Oh, he won't touch it?
He won't touch it.

00:16:15,112 --> 00:16:17,114
But, Mike, wouldn't
the animal rights people

00:16:17,114 --> 00:16:18,448
get all over this?
You're el--

00:16:18,448 --> 00:16:21,184
You're electrocuting
the animals.

00:16:21,184 --> 00:16:23,086
Actually, they like it,

00:16:23,086 --> 00:16:25,522
because they know
the alternative is lethal force.

00:16:25,522 --> 00:16:29,259
People are, unfortunately,
shooting squirrels to death.

00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:31,094
There's no way to stop
an animal--

00:16:31,094 --> 00:16:33,096
Is that legal?
It's totally legal,

00:16:33,096 --> 00:16:34,397
totally unethical.

00:16:34,397 --> 00:16:37,434
There's a squirrel rehabilitator
in massachusetts.

00:16:37,434 --> 00:16:39,236
Squirrel rehabilitator?

00:16:39,236 --> 00:16:41,138
If he finds squirrels
that were orphaned,

00:16:41,138 --> 00:16:43,306
for whatever reason,
he'll nurse the baby squirrels

00:16:43,306 --> 00:16:45,375
with a bottle till they're
well enough to go away.
(laughs)

00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,210
And you know what?
He said to me--

00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:49,513
he said, "Mike D., I would not
own your bird feeder,

00:16:49,513 --> 00:16:52,349
but I like it, because I know
the alternative is terrible."

00:16:54,151 --> 00:16:56,052
Mike, is there
a business here?

00:16:56,052 --> 00:16:57,387

Let's get serious here.
Okay.

00:16:59,156 --> 00:17:02,058
We have sold $196,096.

00:17:02,058 --> 00:17:05,162
It was 4,131 units.

00:17:05,162 --> 00:17:10,167
Average wholesale price--
$47.47 per Unit.

00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:12,202
How much money have you
put into it so far?

00:17:12,202 --> 00:17:13,336
I had an Angel investor.

00:17:13,336 --> 00:17:15,005
How much did he put in?

00:17:15,005 --> 00:17:16,106
$140,000.

00:17:16,106 --> 00:17:17,174
Really?

00:17:17,174 --> 00:17:18,175
How much have you
paid him back?

00:17:30,453 --> 00:17:33,123

00:17:33,123 --> 00:17:35,091
Thousands.

00:17:35,091 --> 00:17:36,960
Not tens of thousands.

Do you have a patent on it?

00:17:40,397 --> 00:17:43,066
Unfortunately, the--I had
the worst patent attorney

00:17:43,066 --> 00:17:45,035
on planet earth.
He was older than dirt.

00:17:45,035 --> 00:17:47,237
He was 15 years behind
the current state of the law,

00:17:47,237 --> 00:17:50,073
so it was denied.
We chose not to appeal--

00:17:50,073 --> 00:17:53,076
was it denied because something
else existed already like it?

00:17:53,076 --> 00:17:54,077
No, no, no.

00:21:53,242 --> 00:21:54,443
Over what period of time?

00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:56,245
I started in 2004.

00:21:56,245 --> 00:21:59,181
Last calendar year,
we sold $800,000.

00:21:59,181 --> 00:22:01,016
This year, we're s--
We're slated to sell

00:22:01,016 --> 00:22:03,218
probably a million,
a million 50.

00:22:03,218 --> 00:22:04,987
What are you gonna make
on that million dollars?

00:22:04,987 --> 00:22:06,388
Uh, we're running about 20%.

00:22:06,388 --> 00:22:08,190
What do you need us for?

00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:10,092
I need money,
and I need somebody

00:22:10,092 --> 00:22:13,061
who knows business
to help me grow the business.

00:22:13,061 --> 00:22:17,032
You're, uh, asking for 25%
for $400,000.

00:22:17,032 --> 00:22:21,336
That's around $1.6 million
you are valuing the business at.

00:22:21,336 --> 00:22:25,040
And you made a profit
of $150,000 last year.
Yeah.

00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,375
I figured one and a half
times sales.

00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:28,076
Why did you figure that?

00:22:28,076 --> 00:22:30,279
Let me go through my client--
My client list.

00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:32,314
Daniel boulud
is our number-One client.

00:22:32,314 --> 00:22:34,016
We have our retail store--

00:22:34,016 --> 00:22:35,317
We have one retail store
up in vermont

00:22:35,317 --> 00:22:37,986
where we can sell
all of our odds and ends

00:22:37,986 --> 00:22:39,288
and we can test-market
our product.

00:22:39,288 --> 00:22:42,357
It does about $400,000
a year.

00:22:42,357 --> 00:22:45,227
Wow.
Internet, which is about
10% of our business.

00:22:45,227 --> 00:22:47,329
Wholesale, which is about
10% of our business.

00:22:47,329 --> 00:22:49,331
Uh, then we have
restaurants.

00:22:49,331 --> 00:22:51,366
And we also just started
talking to Fleming's,

00:22:51,366 --> 00:22:53,268
which is a chain out here
that you guys probably know.

00:22:53,268 --> 00:22:56,138
We're in the orvis catalog.
We're in the frontgate catalog.

00:22:56,138 --> 00:22:58,307
We've talked to Williams-Sonoma
three times.

00:22:58,307 --> 00:23:00,142
Did they give you orders,
or you talked to them?

00:23:00,142 --> 00:23:01,977
Talked to them.
'cause I talked to guy Named
Williams-Sonoma

00:23:01,977 --> 00:23:03,145
three times yesterday.
We was at a dice game.

00:23:03,145 --> 00:23:04,246
Well, we talked to them.
I don't know--

00:23:04,246 --> 00:23:05,914
but then
they approached me.

00:23:05,914 --> 00:23:08,083
They wanted 25 Pieces
for their top 12 stores.

00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:09,318
We couldn't make the demand.

00:23:09,318 --> 00:23:11,386
Right now I have
a-a 2,000-Square-Foot shop

00:23:11,386 --> 00:23:13,288
on my property.

00:23:13,288 --> 00:23:15,390
We need to move out
to a production facility

00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:17,292
so I can grow the business.

00:23:17,292 --> 00:23:19,294
I can't keep selling
if I can't produce.

00:23:19,294 --> 00:23:21,163
Why wouldn't you focus on
the one thing

00:23:21,163 --> 00:23:23,232
that you can differentiate
yourself in being--

00:23:23,232 --> 00:23:26,201
The best chopping block
in America,

00:23:26,201 --> 00:23:29,204
made from the trees of vermont,
and just focus on that?

00:23:29,204 --> 00:23:31,240
Why do you need
to make these?
He has to offer more.

00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,108
Thank you, Lori.
Do you know how inexpensively
these are made in Asia?

00:23:33,108 --> 00:23:35,978
There's thousands of them.
They are. They are.
Absolutely.

00:23:35,978 --> 00:23:37,279
And you know what?
They crack, they drop,

00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:39,314
they're thin, they're bamboo.
Yeah, yeah, but they sell!

00:23:39,314 --> 00:23:41,116
They sell.
Yeah, Kevin, you can't just
offer chopping blocks.

00:23:41,116 --> 00:23:42,918
I sell
to the premium market.

00:23:42,918 --> 00:23:45,087
Why not?
That sells--the--
the cheap ones sell to the--

00:23:45,087 --> 00:23:46,355
to the people that want
to walk into walmart

00:23:46,355 --> 00:23:48,156
and pay $2.99.

00:23:48,156 --> 00:23:50,192
Okay.
People--but people who are
giving wedding gifts

00:23:50,192 --> 00:23:52,194
don't want to give
a $2.99 bowl.

00:23:52,194 --> 00:23:54,296
They want a nice set
of wooden bowls. I have--
I'm trying to figure out

00:23:54,296 --> 00:23:56,265
how you carve a niche
in your space

00:23:56,265 --> 00:23:57,966
that is defendable.

00:23:57,966 --> 00:24:00,002
I think by expanding your
business into all this stuff,

00:24:00,002 --> 00:24:01,870
you're going
into some categories

00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:03,205
where there's tremendous
competition.
No. You--You know what?

00:24:03,205 --> 00:24:04,906
I don't normally jump in

00:24:04,906 --> 00:24:06,842
and speak
for the entrepreneur...
thank you, Lori.

00:24:06,842 --> 00:24:08,277
I appreciate that.
But, Kevin, he can't just
sell chopping blocks.

00:24:08,277 --> 00:24:10,178
Why not?
It's Boring.

00:24:10,178 --> 00:24:12,080
That's right.
Because nobody Wants
just chopping blocks

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,850
from a company.
They want a number of S.K.U.S.

00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:16,084
He's got a retail store.
(Lori) Yeah.

00:24:16,084 --> 00:24:17,853
What's he gonna do all of
a sudden for his retail store,

00:24:17,853 --> 00:24:18,954
go, "I'll stop"?
forget about it--

00:24:18,954 --> 00:24:20,088
"I could sell tie-dye."

00:24:20,088 --> 00:24:22,257
I forbid you to talk about
this topic anymore.

00:24:22,257 --> 00:24:24,993
David, here's where
it doesn't add up for me.

00:24:26,094 --> 00:24:27,929
Normally,
when people want money,

00:24:27,929 --> 00:24:30,299
it's in order to lower
their cost

00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:32,167
and increase their margin.

00:24:32,167 --> 00:24:34,169
Your margin is fantastic.

00:24:34,169 --> 00:24:37,072
It is to increase
our production capability.

00:24:37,072 --> 00:24:40,208
We're profitable. I can sell
as much product as I can make.

00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:42,077
Well, do you need machinery,
or do you need staff?
I do.

00:24:42,077 --> 00:24:43,912
We need space,
we need machinery,

00:24:43,912 --> 00:24:45,914
and we probably need
more people.

00:24:45,914 --> 00:24:47,282
Nobody's brought this up,
so I'm--

00:24:47,282 --> 00:24:49,151
I'm gonna bring up
something...
sure.

00:24:49,151 --> 00:24:50,986
That might be
a crushing blow.

00:24:50,986 --> 00:24:52,154
Uh-Oh.

00:24:52,154 --> 00:24:53,855
You're competing against--

00:24:53,855 --> 00:24:55,157
You know,
the new wave for all things

00:24:55,157 --> 00:24:59,127
that are cutting boards
is antimicrobial boards.

00:24:59,127 --> 00:25:00,996
You're aware of that.

00:25:00,996 --> 00:25:02,998
I am.
And they're extremely
popular on the market.

00:25:02,998 --> 00:25:05,834
The whole point about it is,
is that salmonella, e. Coli,

00:25:05,834 --> 00:25:07,836
and other types of things
will not...
okay.

00:25:07,836 --> 00:25:09,871
Leech into the board

00:25:09,871 --> 00:25:11,940
and therefore
contaminate your food.

00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,108
That's not True.

00:25:13,108 --> 00:25:15,110
"Cook's illustrated" Came out
with an article,

00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:18,213
and what they found was
that plastic cutting boards

00:25:18,213 --> 00:25:20,849
kept the bacteria on them
longer

00:25:20,849 --> 00:25:22,951
than the wood
cutting boards did,

00:25:22,951 --> 00:25:25,854
because wood has a natural
propensity to kill bacteria.

00:25:27,122 --> 00:25:29,191
I think you ought to ignore
all the comments.

00:25:29,191 --> 00:25:31,193
I get that you're trying
to grow this business.

00:25:31,193 --> 00:25:33,161
All you need is capital.

00:25:33,161 --> 00:25:35,263
Basically, what you're saying--
You know your stuff.

00:25:35,263 --> 00:25:37,065
In order for me
to be effective,

00:25:37,065 --> 00:25:39,768
it means I have to make
a commitment to learn

00:25:39,768 --> 00:25:41,236
the Butcher block
and board industry.

00:25:41,236 --> 00:25:43,772
I don't feel comfortable
giving advice

00:25:43,772 --> 00:25:45,240
unless I do the Work.
Okay.

00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,043
I can appreciate that.
And if anything,
I-I do that too much.

00:25:48,043 --> 00:25:50,946
And so, for that reason,
I'm out.

00:25:53,014 --> 00:25:55,751
I'm a hard worker.
I am dedicated.

00:25:55,751 --> 00:25:57,052
I am loyal to this business.

00:25:57,052 --> 00:25:58,787
I know it has
a potential to grow.

00:25:58,787 --> 00:26:00,155
I really do.

00:26:00,155 --> 00:26:01,957
You know, David,
one of the things

00:26:01,957 --> 00:26:03,992
I really like about me
is I'm always right.

00:26:03,992 --> 00:26:05,861
Well, you think
you're always right.

00:26:05,861 --> 00:26:07,896
I know I'm always right.
It's important to know that,

00:26:07,896 --> 00:26:09,898
because in your case,

00:26:09,898 --> 00:26:11,833
my vision of your business
is different than yours.

00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:13,702
I'd argue to you,
when you actually allocate

00:26:13,702 --> 00:26:16,171
the time that you're spending,
selling a spoon--

00:26:16,171 --> 00:26:18,740
It's not really profitable
at all.

00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,777
You don't agree with me--
I disagree--
I disagree, Kevin. I disagree.

00:26:21,777 --> 00:26:23,145
We need to be
at the full line--
Why do you disagree?

00:26:23,145 --> 00:26:24,946
Because--
Numbers never lie, David.

00:26:24,946 --> 00:26:26,748
I'm not saying the numbers
are wrong.

00:26:26,748 --> 00:26:27,949
What I'm saying is
you're wrong.

00:26:31,753 --> 00:26:33,121
The only reason
a business exists

00:26:33,121 --> 00:26:34,890
is to make money.

00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,992
You can be passionate
about it--
I agree. I agree.

00:26:36,992 --> 00:26:40,028
You and I don't agree
on the next direction.

00:26:40,028 --> 00:26:42,063
That's what happens
in the shark tank.

00:26:42,063 --> 00:26:43,899
We don't have to.
It's your business.

00:26:43,899 --> 00:26:45,133
But it's my money.

00:26:47,102 --> 00:26:48,103
I'm out.

00:26:49,871 --> 00:26:52,741
(Daymond) Dave, um,
I-I love your Passion.
Thank you.

00:26:52,741 --> 00:26:54,075
You have a good business
for yourself.
Thank you.

00:26:54,075 --> 00:26:57,712
You're a smart guy, but I'm
just not excited about it.

00:26:57,712 --> 00:26:59,080
I'm out.

00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,116
Sorry.
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

00:27:01,116 --> 00:27:02,918
Well, not thank you
for being out,

00:27:02,918 --> 00:27:05,620
but thank you
for your feedback.

00:27:06,822 --> 00:27:09,958
David, um...
make me an offer,
Robert.

00:27:09,958 --> 00:27:11,793
Please.
Look, I-I love--

00:27:11,793 --> 00:27:13,061
It's a great business.

00:27:13,061 --> 00:27:15,864
I love the story, and I think
great Businesses are built

00:27:15,864 --> 00:27:18,066
when somebody has the passion
like you.

00:27:18,066 --> 00:27:20,635
But here--Here's my challenge.

00:27:20,635 --> 00:27:24,072
As an investor, to give you
a $400,000 investment,

00:27:24,072 --> 00:27:27,042
which is 50% of today's sales,

00:27:27,042 --> 00:27:29,678
that seems risky to me.

00:27:29,678 --> 00:27:32,080
And I don't know enough
about your business

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,816
to share your passion in it.

00:27:34,816 --> 00:27:35,784
I'm out.

00:27:38,854 --> 00:27:40,689
Lori?

00:27:41,957 --> 00:27:43,792
I'll give you
a bigger percentage.

00:27:43,792 --> 00:27:45,660
I want a partner who can
help me grow my business.

00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,728
Well...

00:27:47,963 --> 00:27:49,998
I think your work
is beautiful.
Thank you.

00:27:49,998 --> 00:27:52,667
And I really respect
and admire what you've done.

00:27:52,667 --> 00:27:55,637
But I am brutally honest.

00:27:55,637 --> 00:27:59,040
And I--my concern is
the antimicrobial boards

00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,577
are really coming on strong,
and they have been for years,

00:28:02,577 --> 00:28:04,679
and they're taking
a larger part of the market.

00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:06,748
I agree, but you say that
with no--With No...
and--

00:28:06,748 --> 00:28:08,683
Uh, industry knowledge
on that.

00:28:08,683 --> 00:28:10,986
I-I do have knowledge
about it, and it's okay.

00:28:10,986 --> 00:28:13,722
I mean, I have my feelings,
you have yours.

00:28:13,722 --> 00:28:15,757
But for me,
it's not a good investment.

00:28:15,757 --> 00:28:18,059
I think it's too risky,
because I don't think

00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:19,828
that you're
with the cutting edge

00:28:19,828 --> 00:28:20,996
of what's really happening.

00:28:20,996 --> 00:28:22,898
And for that reason, I'm out.

00:28:26,902 --> 00:28:29,905
♪♪♪

00:28:29,905 --> 00:28:31,873
40%, Mark.

40%. I do everything.

00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:35,977
That's a big change,
but it's not--

00:28:35,977 --> 00:28:37,979
It's not my--Not my kind
of deal, David.

It--I--

00:28:46,755 --> 00:28:48,723

So go in with mark.
$200,000 apiece.

00:28:53,695 --> 00:28:56,798
You guys each get 22.5%.
You get enough skin in the game,

00:28:56,798 --> 00:28:57,933

the business.

do you really want this?

No, I want to know.
I want to know.
You know what? Don't even.

00:29:12,681 --> 00:29:14,683

I want a partner

Don't even go there.
David, thank you.

Don't even go there.
David,
you're overselling now.

and so is the time it takes
to make it yourself.

00:31:16,671 --> 00:31:17,972
I've been
a long-Haul truck driver

00:31:17,972 --> 00:31:19,808

Besides being a truck driver,
I am a total gumbo geek.

00:31:26,915 --> 00:31:30,051
A few years ago, friends asked
me to make gumbo for them

00:31:30,051 --> 00:31:32,887
for the holidays,
but each in a different way.

00:31:32,887 --> 00:31:34,689

Because even for
an experienced cook like myself,

gumbo can take hours
to prepare.

00:31:39,728 --> 00:31:42,664
So instead,
I made for them a frozen,

00:31:42,664 --> 00:31:44,566
fully seasoned gumbo base

00:31:44,566 --> 00:31:46,568

In the last two years?

00:33:38,746 --> 00:33:41,816

00:33:41,816 --> 00:33:43,718
for only three days a week.

00:33:43,718 --> 00:33:45,553

a lot of the money

What--what do you
need money for?

00:34:00,368 --> 00:34:02,370
We need money so that we can
increase our inventory

00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:04,539
and get it into more stores.

00:34:04,539 --> 00:34:08,710

00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:12,480

15 pallets?

00:34:16,751 --> 00:34:18,553

be frozen, though, right?

00:34:18,553 --> 00:34:20,521
It is frozen.
So is that
a permanent listing,

00:34:20,521 --> 00:34:22,624
or they're gonna put it...
they're gonna put it in
as a permanent item.

00:34:22,624 --> 00:34:24,759
As a matter of fact, we were
accepted as a permanent item

00:34:24,759 --> 00:34:27,662

you were in costco,

00:34:45,747 --> 00:34:48,383
and you were
giving out samples...
correct.

00:34:48,383 --> 00:34:51,419
And people were Loving it?
Yes. We sold 50,000 units.

00:34:51,419 --> 00:34:53,454
So do you think
that you would be able

00:34:53,454 --> 00:34:56,624
to get your gumbo
into the costcos nationwide?

00:34:56,624 --> 00:34:59,727
Yes. Costco has
about 600 clubs nationwide.

00:34:59,727 --> 00:35:01,396
Even if I were only able

00:35:01,396 --> 00:35:03,698
to get into
a third of those stores,

00:35:03,698 --> 00:35:05,667

would be... incredible.

00:35:05,667 --> 00:35:07,435
Well, tell us

00:35:07,435 --> 00:35:08,603
and what you're
selling them for.

00:35:08,603 --> 00:35:11,406
That gumbo brick
Costs about $4 to make.

00:35:11,406 --> 00:35:13,341
Okay, and that's
with Packaging, everything?

00:35:13,341 --> 00:35:14,342
Correct. Out the door.

00:35:14,342 --> 00:35:16,611
Um, we sell it to costco
for $9.99.

00:35:16,611 --> 00:35:18,479
Can you get that cost down?

00:35:18,479 --> 00:35:20,348
Uh, if I could
make bigger quantities.

00:35:20,348 --> 00:35:23,518
I can only afford
to make small quantities.

lobster tails and scallops.

00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,535

00:35:55,683 --> 00:35:57,618
Carole, you obviously
have a great product.

00:35:57,618 --> 00:36:00,688
You're working hard.
It's obviously your life,

00:36:00,688 --> 00:36:02,290
and that's a beautiful thing.

00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:05,360
But in order to take $200,000
from an investor,

00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,695
particularly me,
you've gotta be ready

00:36:07,695 --> 00:36:10,264
to take the $200,000.

00:36:10,264 --> 00:36:12,333
I just don't think you're ready
to take someone's money

00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:15,336
and try to scale as big
as you wanna go yet.

00:36:15,336 --> 00:36:16,671
So for that reason,
I'm out.

00:36:16,671 --> 00:36:19,340
(whispers) okay.

00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,341
But the gumbo's great.

00:36:20,341 --> 00:36:21,642
Thanks.
I appreciate it.

00:36:23,578 --> 00:36:25,546
I came here because
I need the business acumen.

00:36:25,546 --> 00:36:26,581
I don't have that.

00:36:26,581 --> 00:36:29,250
I just know
that I make a great product.

00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,485
And it's a good idea.

00:36:30,485 --> 00:36:32,487
Um, I just--I need help
with that.

00:36:32,487 --> 00:36:34,555
You have decent margins.

00:36:34,555 --> 00:36:36,491
Have you talked
to anybody else

00:36:36,491 --> 00:36:39,360
about giving them
a little bit more incentive

00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,295
to make the product?

00:36:41,295 --> 00:36:42,697
Actually, this
particular co-Packer

00:36:42,697 --> 00:36:45,666
is willing to become
the vendor of record.

00:36:45,666 --> 00:36:48,569
What their requirement is
is that I pay for the packaging.

00:36:48,569 --> 00:36:50,471
And I don't
have money for that.

00:36:50,471 --> 00:36:52,607
The packaging
for just that order alone

00:36:52,607 --> 00:36:55,176
is about $10,000.

00:36:55,176 --> 00:36:57,445
But you made
$100,000 this year.
Where'd the money go?

00:36:57,445 --> 00:36:59,347
We're living off of it.
That's all we have.

00:36:59,347 --> 00:37:02,216
We don't have anything else.
I have six brothers and sisters.

00:37:02,216 --> 00:37:04,285
We're all
doing this business together.

00:37:04,285 --> 00:37:07,355
We're crowded up in one house
trying to make it happen.

00:37:07,355 --> 00:37:08,556
Okay. I-I-I got that.

00:37:08,556 --> 00:37:10,291
As an outside investor,

00:37:10,291 --> 00:37:13,628
how can we understand if we're
actually really making money

00:37:13,628 --> 00:37:16,364
or losing money with you?
Yes.

00:37:16,364 --> 00:37:17,498
I need--
I'm so--I'm so busy

00:37:17,498 --> 00:37:19,333
with my guys, trying to
take care of my numbers.

00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:22,170
Okay. I need help
in that--in that area.

00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:23,404
And you will get there...
I definitely do.

00:37:23,404 --> 00:37:26,274
And you're on a great path.
But as of now, I'm out.

00:37:27,341 --> 00:37:30,344
(clicks teeth) okay.

00:37:30,344 --> 00:37:32,513
Any other offers?

00:37:32,513 --> 00:37:36,350
Carole, by asking
for $200,000 for 20%,

00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,552
you're telling me
that your business

00:37:37,552 --> 00:37:39,554
is worth a million dollars.

00:37:39,554 --> 00:37:41,422
Yes.
Which it isn't right now.

00:37:41,422 --> 00:37:44,459
I-I... you know,
I rarely get this kind of angst

00:37:44,459 --> 00:37:46,627
in--in the--
in the shark tank,

00:37:46,627 --> 00:37:48,362
'cause I'm very definitive.

00:37:48,362 --> 00:37:50,231
The product
is so fantastic,

00:37:50,231 --> 00:37:52,300
but the infrastructure
isn't there.

00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,335
And I know that that's one of
my weaknesses. I definitely do.

00:37:54,335 --> 00:37:56,337
Yeah, it is--It is a problem.

00:37:56,337 --> 00:38:00,141
(Robert) Carole, I, uh...

00:38:00,141 --> 00:38:01,209
I love gumbo.

00:38:01,209 --> 00:38:03,377
If it's on the menu
anywhere I go,

00:38:03,377 --> 00:38:05,513
I order it.
The spicier the Better.

00:38:05,513 --> 00:38:08,116
Okay.
Here's the thing about food--

00:38:08,116 --> 00:38:12,153
the margins
are actually not very good.

00:38:12,153 --> 00:38:16,224
Once you scale, it's a very
challenging business to run.

00:38:16,224 --> 00:38:18,326
'cause the margins
get smaller and smaller,

00:38:18,326 --> 00:38:21,262
and you've really gotta run
a tight business.
Mm-hmm.

00:38:21,262 --> 00:38:22,530
I'd rather see you
take your equity,

00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:28,169
bring in an industry partner who
can guide you to that next step,

00:38:28,169 --> 00:38:29,303
'cause you'll always
find the money.

00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:33,274
I'm out.

00:38:33,274 --> 00:38:37,378
I understand.
I understand.

00:38:48,356 --> 00:38:50,491
Lori, what are you gonna do?

00:38:52,326 --> 00:38:54,095
I think she wants
more gumbo.

00:38:54,095 --> 00:38:57,298
♪♪♪

00:39:03,604 --> 00:39:05,439
♪♪♪

00:39:08,376 --> 00:39:10,378
Three sharks are out.

00:39:10,378 --> 00:39:15,283
Lori and Kevin are Carole's
last chance to get a deal.

00:39:15,283 --> 00:39:16,484
Lori, what are you
gonna do?

00:39:18,586 --> 00:39:19,620
Well, I have to say,

00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:22,490
I love you,
and I love your Gumbo.

00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:24,659
Thank you.
I was not even hungry,

00:39:24,659 --> 00:39:27,295
and my gumbo's almost gone.
(laughs) okay.

00:39:27,295 --> 00:39:29,630
So that's a testament
to your gumbo.
Okay.

00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:33,401
Um, but I'm
kind of on the fence.

00:39:33,401 --> 00:39:37,238
Because $200,000
is a lot of money.

00:39:37,238 --> 00:39:39,240
As Kevin said,
your valuation's at a million.

00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,276
And, uh,
that's kind of hard for me.

00:39:42,276 --> 00:39:44,212
I-I-I don't think
you're there.

00:39:44,212 --> 00:39:47,615
This is the smartest thing
I've ever come up with to do.

00:39:47,615 --> 00:39:50,451
It's my life.
It's all that I do.

00:39:50,451 --> 00:39:55,690
Um, right now, um,
I'm homeless.

00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:58,459
I'm staying with friends
right now.

00:39:58,459 --> 00:40:00,294
And when I'm not with them,

00:40:00,294 --> 00:40:03,264
I go over to my sister's house
and stay with them.

00:40:03,264 --> 00:40:06,267
And if not,
I have a Van. (chuckles)

00:40:06,267 --> 00:40:08,236
But...
where does your daughter live?

00:40:08,236 --> 00:40:10,304
She's with me.
She's always been with me.

00:40:10,304 --> 00:40:12,607
And by her being with me
all this time,

00:40:12,607 --> 00:40:14,475
she knows how
to write a business plan,

00:40:14,475 --> 00:40:16,577
she knows how to,
you know, check prices

00:40:16,577 --> 00:40:18,479
on different items
that we use.

00:40:18,479 --> 00:40:20,414
She's, uh,
she's been there for me.

00:40:20,414 --> 00:40:23,351
When I decided
to become a truck driver

00:40:23,351 --> 00:40:25,553
and reinvent myself,
I felt empowered,

00:40:25,553 --> 00:40:29,223
because I was doing
a "Man's job."

00:40:29,223 --> 00:40:31,492
But I was taking care of my baby
at the same time.

00:40:31,492 --> 00:40:35,263
And that's why I'm here,
because I'm here for her.

00:40:35,263 --> 00:40:37,265
This isn't right.
I'll put up half.

00:40:39,467 --> 00:40:42,270
This is crazy.
What do you wanna do?

00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:44,238
She's got a product.

00:40:44,238 --> 00:40:45,339
I know.

00:40:52,146 --> 00:40:53,147
Wow.

00:40:53,147 --> 00:40:54,248
Come in with me.

00:40:58,185 --> 00:41:04,158
So the offer is
$200,000 for 50%.

00:41:04,158 --> 00:41:05,359
For 50%?

00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,194
What you have is a lot
of drive and a great product.

00:41:07,194 --> 00:41:08,596
The problem is
you don't have a business.

00:41:08,596 --> 00:41:10,364
And we're gonna
fix that for you.

00:41:10,364 --> 00:41:13,267
Absolutely. I need that.
And so we feel it's important

00:41:13,267 --> 00:41:15,603
that we run it,
and we help to make sure

00:41:15,603 --> 00:41:19,340
that we make you
very, very successful.

00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,409
Oh, my God. (laughs)

00:41:21,409 --> 00:41:22,543
You're not worth
a million bucks,

00:41:22,543 --> 00:41:24,178
but we're gonna
put you in business, okay?

00:41:24,178 --> 00:41:25,513
That's what happens
here in the shark tank

00:41:25,513 --> 00:41:27,281
if you're willing to work.

00:41:27,281 --> 00:41:29,583
That's what makes
America great--People like you.

00:41:29,583 --> 00:41:31,385
Thank you so much.
Wait a minute, Carole--

00:41:31,385 --> 00:41:32,386
do you accept their offer?

00:41:32,386 --> 00:41:33,387
I take your offer.

00:41:33,387 --> 00:41:34,522
You got it.

00:41:34,522 --> 00:41:35,623
Oh...
get ready
to work your ass off.

00:41:35,623 --> 00:41:37,391
Yes!
And make a lot of gumbo.

00:41:37,391 --> 00:41:40,261
Yes! Yes, yes. (laughs)

00:41:40,261 --> 00:41:41,529
Thank you.
(Lori) You're welcome.
You're welcome.

00:41:41,529 --> 00:41:43,531
This is great.
This is great.
Thank you so much.

00:41:43,531 --> 00:41:46,100
Put you back in business.
Tell Costco we're coming.

00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,135
All right.
Oh, my god, Yes.

00:41:48,135 --> 00:41:50,171
Thank you so much.
That's terrific.

00:41:50,171 --> 00:41:51,539
Oh, god.
Congratulations, Carole.

00:41:51,539 --> 00:41:53,441
Thank you so much.
Awesome.

00:41:53,441 --> 00:41:55,543
Oh, I appreciate it.
Oh, god.

00:41:55,543 --> 00:41:58,412
I don't know what to do.
Congratulations on finding
a heart in the grinch.

00:41:58,412 --> 00:42:00,314
(laughs) okay.
No, no, no.
That was shocking.

00:42:00,314 --> 00:42:01,349
No, the food's good.
I'd never do this

00:42:01,349 --> 00:42:02,483
if I didn't like
your product.

00:42:02,483 --> 00:42:04,151
It's a great product.
Thank you so much.

00:42:04,151 --> 00:42:05,319
I appreciate it so much.
Thank you.

00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:06,320
Congratulations.
Congratulations.

00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,222
Oh, yes!
Congratulations.

00:42:08,222 --> 00:42:09,323
Aah!

00:42:10,524 --> 00:42:13,160
She called you
a slimy something, and...

00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,396
I like that.
(laughs)

00:42:15,396 --> 00:42:17,431
What do you know?
Kevin has a heart.

00:42:17,431 --> 00:42:21,435
Let's not go that far.
She had me from the moment
she called me slimy.

00:42:21,435 --> 00:42:23,504
(laughs)

00:42:23,504 --> 00:42:25,506
This deal
means everything to us.

00:42:25,506 --> 00:42:29,033
This means that we can
actually have a real life now.

00:42:29,033 --> 00:42:32,069
Um, it just means
that we can move forward,

00:42:32,069 --> 00:42:34,238
and I can provide
for my daughter.
