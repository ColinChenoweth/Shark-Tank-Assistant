00:00:00,801 --> 00:00:02,002
(man) The sharks are back

00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,671
in an all-new season
of "Shark Tank,"

00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:07,374
Where hopeful entrepreneurs
from across the country

00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:10,077
dream of a chance
to secure an investment

00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:12,179
and gain powerful partners

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,449
to start, grow, or save
their businesses.

00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:17,351
If the sharks hear
a great idea,

00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:20,187
they're ready to invest
using their own money...

00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,956
mark, would you like
to go in with me?

00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:24,958
You'd be insane
not to take that.

00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:28,028
And they'll fight each other
for a piece of the action.

00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,029
I'll give you more cash.

00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,564
Did you just jump in
on my geek?

00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:33,901
But first the entrepreneurs
must convince a shark

00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:36,703
to invest the full amount
they're asking for,

00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,672
or they'll walk away
with nothing.

00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:40,140
Mama taught me
how to bake.

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,742
This company's gonna be
a lot bigger than $10 million.

00:00:41,742 --> 00:00:42,910
(Robert) Wow.
Wow.

00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,244
It's sink...

00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:45,245
you're telling me

00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:46,880
you can't
control your own destiny.

00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,448
Or swim...

00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:52,452
this girl served 15 months
in Afghanistan for you.

00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:54,354
So...
wow.

00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:55,889
While you were making money!

00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,660
Who are the sharks?

00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:03,564
They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors

00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,832
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.

00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:09,870
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist

00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,073
who turned a $10,000 loan
into a software business

00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:17,578
worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,947
Lori Greiner,
the queen of QVC,

00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:21,582
holds over a hundred patents

00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,517
and has launched
over 300 products,

00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:25,819
grossing over
a half a billion dollars

00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,387
in retail sales.

00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:30,490
Daymond John is a fashion mogul
and branding expert

00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,059
who grew his homemade
clothing line

00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:36,597
into the globally recognized
fashion brand fubu.

00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:39,700
Robert Herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,

00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,368
is now a technology mogul

00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:43,203
who sold
his first internet companies

00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:47,007
for over $350 million.

00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:48,875
And Mark Cuban,

00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,211
notorious
billionaire entrepreneur

00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:55,100
and the outspoken owner
of the Dallas Mavericks.

00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:05,892
♪♪

00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,529
First into the shark tank
is J. Jones,

00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:11,798
an American who believes
he has perfected

00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:15,969
a traditional English Treat.

00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,773
Hi, I'm J. Jones
from Denver, Colorado,

00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:22,643
my company is Jones Scones.

00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:25,012
And I'm asking for $100,000

00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:26,680
for 25% of my company.

00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,149
Let me tell you
why Jones Scones are awesome--

00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,584
It's because they're authentic.

00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,719
They're just like the scones
you would find in England,

00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,988
and not the cardboard,
icing-covered copies

00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,823
that you find
in some coffee chains here.

00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,092
Now I started making scones
for the usual reasons,

00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,762
and that's pretty much
England and women.

00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:42,996
When I lived in England,

00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,798
I was there for school
and some other adventures.

00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:47,167
I fell in love
with my local bakery's scones.

00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,202
And when I came home
to go to law school in D.C.,

00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:50,537
I could not find a scone

00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,172
that did not taste
like compressed sand.

00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,441
So mama taught me how to bake.
I made a scone.

00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:55,942
And I would make them
for friends,

00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:57,377
they helped out
when I was dating.

00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:59,980
So I put my law career on hold
and I dove in headfirst.

00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,081
Had no capital.

00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:03,617
I was delivering scones
in my jeep.

00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:06,687
So I have some scones
for you to try.

00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,124
Some blueberry.
Blueberry?

00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,292
That's blueberry.
Thank you.

00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,127
How about you, Lori?
What do you want?

00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:16,763
All right. I'm a chocolate girl.
Is there a chocolate?
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:17,964
Thank you.
Is that blueberry up there?

00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,132
It's blueberry.
Hey, save me a blueberry.

00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,367
You want a blueberry?
Yes, sir.

00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,768
Mark, you can share
half mine.

00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:24,104
That's what's up right there.

00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:25,839
(Robert)
J., why is it so dry?

00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,607
Is that on purpose?

00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,676
Our scones
tend to be more moist.

00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:30,944
If you're experiencing
a dryness,

00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,312
I find that
to be unusual.

00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:34,081
Scones are on
the drier side.

00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:36,717
They're not like
a muffin. More like a biscuit.

00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:39,319
Are scones typically
a breakfast food?
Yes.

00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,487
They are.

00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:41,922
J., what are you selling
in terms of the scone?

00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:45,258
Are the... are the scones
selling cash?

00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,461
Yes. Uh...
how much?

00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:50,397
We are selling right now
$5,000 worth of scones a month.

00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,565
(Lori) a month.
A month.

00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:52,733
Yes.

00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:53,900
Why are your scones better

00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,069
than the other
typical scones?

00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,170
Well, number one,

00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,872
that cream style
that we talked about.

00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:00,006
Number two,
they're all natural.

00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:03,343
So we found a home
in Whole Foods.

00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:04,344
You're in Whole Foods?

00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:05,445
One store, right?

00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:06,613
(laughs) No.

00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,014
We're in--We're in
six stores now,

00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:09,683
uh, in the Denver/
Rocky mountain region,

00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:10,717
and in Utah.

00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,385
Why can't you get
all the stores?

00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:15,689
We were. And, uh, might as well
kick into the sales talk.

00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:16,823
At one point,
we were selling

00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,692
$113,000 worth of scones
a month.

00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:20,293
We sold
a half-million of these

00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,662
over the course
of the life of the business.
What happened, J.?

00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:25,632
Well, uh... (laughs)
This is why we're here.
This is not good.

00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,067
Is this a bad story?

00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:29,202
No, it's not a bad story,
'cause I'm here.

00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:30,203
All right. Tell us.

00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:31,738
What we did was,
we expanded.

00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,741
We went from Denver
out to California,

00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,977
and we picked
a new manufacturer.

00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:38,044
Terrible mistake.

00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,580
I was not able
to oversee my co-packing

00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,748
the way I should have.

00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,049
And when I had to correct
that mistake,

00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,651
we didn't have
the capital to fix it.

00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:45,919
We had to pull back,

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,688
so sales came back down
to $75,000 last year--

00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,824
Or 2 years ago,
and $65,000.

00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:52,259
So they didn't manufacture
good product for you,

00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:53,627
was that the problem?

00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,328
They didn't do it right.
You couldn't oversee it,

00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,130
so you couldn't
come in and test it...
it's not their fault.

00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,698
It's my fault. I should have
been out there more

00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,100
to watch the product.

00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,068
And frankly, I should have
been talking to people like you

00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,104
before I expanded, because
we would have had the capital

00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:07,641
to maintain the ground
that I worked so hard to earn.

00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,643
Are those same stores now

00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,478
willing to give you
another chance?

00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,779
Yes. We know that in Denver,

00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,548
and we believe so
in California.

00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:17,050
How long have you been
in the Denver Whole Foods,

00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,718
and how many times
have they reordered?

00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:19,886
Seven years.

00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,688
Seven years?
(Robert) seven years?

00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:24,524
Yeah.
We went from selling

00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:28,361
$37,000 worth of scones
in '07

00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:31,364
to selling $60,500
in '08

00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:34,234
to selling $113,000
in 2009.

00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:37,437
I'm just--I'm not
a big scone guy.

00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,005
I could tell. (laughs)

00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,007
Um, but when I
walk into a whole foods today,

00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,510
do I see
only Jones Scones

00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,880
or do I see multiple
manufacturers of scones?

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,615
People have
done scones locally.

00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:50,417
Nobody has gone
into the scones category

00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:51,952
and said, "Hi, I'm Jones."

00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:53,653
We've got a brand. We've got
someone you can attach it to.

00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:54,955
So it's a fragmented market.

00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:57,390
You're trying
to become the brand.

00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,259
Absolutely.
Yeah, but after six,
seven years

00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:03,630
of around $60,000,
one year popped to $130,000...

00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:07,968
what will $100,000 do that
will be so magical this year?

00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:10,337
We are going to
hire food brokers,

00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:12,505
which is the way to get
our sales force out there.

00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:16,776
The biggest cost that we have
is feeding people the scones.

00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:19,713
You know what, man? J.,
you are such a likeable person.

00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,349
Um, I just don't like it.

00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,384
Well, let me continue
on--on how...

00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,752
you don't
have to with me. I like...

00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,288
I like you, but...

00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:29,456
I'm out.

00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:31,825
Okay.

00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:34,594
We looked at what we can sell
the scones for.

00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:35,629
Whole foods, actually,

00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:38,031
each store Sells
$368 worth of scones

00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:39,833
selling 12 cases a month.

00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,067
That says we're gonna have

00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,136
about a quarter of
a million dollars in sales.

00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,805
Potential. But here's
the reality that I see--

00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,841
You've been in business
for ten years.

00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:51,244
Your sales in the last three
have actually declined.

00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,246
Lots of potential.

00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,383
Tell me what you've learned
in the last few years

00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:58,585
that when you wake up tomorrow,

00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:02,088
it's gonna be a different day
than it was in the past.

00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,991
Team. That's the next part.
Team.

00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:08,261
I've got a guy that can guide me
with what I'm doing.

00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,262
That's bull crap.

00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,031
What you're telling me,

00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:14,334
without any uncertainty
whatsoever,

00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:16,770
is you can't control
your own destiny.

00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,171
I-I hate to agree with Mark,

00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,606
but I agree with him 100%.

00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,876
You're looking for answers
from people outside of yourself.

00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:24,544
I hate when people
tell me

00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:27,580
the answer to my salvation
is a consultant.

00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,015
Yeah. No kidding.

00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,984
No, I'm--I'm not
looking for a consultant, guys.

00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:32,218
But you are.
That's what you just said.

00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:34,054
Wait, no, he just said
his "Team." His "Team."

00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:35,522
But every one of you
has a team.

00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:37,824
Every one of you
has somebody that you rely on.

00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,693
But now you make
the final decisions.

00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:40,860
Here's the thing, though--

00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,228
When I hear you say

00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:44,130
that you've been ten years
in the business,

00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,032
and you're where
you are right now,

00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:47,734
needing
to ask us for money,

00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,402
it tells me
something's wrong.

00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:52,072
There's some reason
why this isn't taking off.

00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:56,376
I'm not sure what that is.
I thought the scone was fine.

00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,778
But for me,
I need to love the product

00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:01,247
and feel passionate
and want to eat it constantly.

00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:02,983
And I'm not at that place.

00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,919
So for that reason,
I'm out.

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,054
Sorry to hear that.

00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,489
What else
can I answer for you?

00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,958
How can--How can
I bring us closer?

00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,927
Well, J.,
here's how I see it--

00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:14,928
I agree with you.

00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:16,963
Nobody wins without a team.

00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:20,767
But I don't have time to be
part of that overall team.

00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:23,870
I wish you all the best,
'cause you're a very nice guy.

00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,072
But I'm out.

00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:28,808
Mr. Wonderful?

00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:33,780
You know, I don't get
emotionally involved.

00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:37,817
The scones are good.
I eat scones.

00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,653
But there's nothing proprietary
about making a scone.

00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:43,590
All there is
is executional excellence.

00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:47,460
And on that test,
you failed once.

00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,397
Doesn't mean
you can't recover.

00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:52,298
But cutting your sales in half

00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:55,835
in a commodity business
like scones is never good.

00:08:57,103 --> 00:09:01,341
Look, this is about money.

00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:04,377
And I can't make any
from what I see. I'm out.

00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,747
Well, I have to thank you
for your time.

00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,049
Good luck.

00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,383
Good luck.
Cheers.

00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,087
And I'm out. (chuckles)

00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:17,757
Mark never said
he's out?

00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,125
Mark never said
he was out? (laughs)
I gave him a little quickie.

00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,126
I gave him
a little quickie.

00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,828
(laughing) That's a first.

00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:23,563
Bye. (laughs)

00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,398
He gave up.

00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,067
Something new every day.

00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,668
Oh, my goodness.

Next up is Brian Altomare,

00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,949
whose business aims
to help people

00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,651
with their extra baggage.

00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:55,835
Hi. My name is Brian Altomare,
and I'm from New York.

00:09:55,835 --> 00:09:57,904
My company is Lugless,

00:09:57,904 --> 00:09:59,806
and I'm here asking
for $100,000

00:09:59,806 --> 00:10:01,541
for 10% equity.

00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,610
Sharks,
people are tired of paying

00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,111
ridiculous airline baggage fees,

00:10:05,111 --> 00:10:06,746
tired of lost luggage,

00:10:06,746 --> 00:10:09,449
and tired of T.S.A.
pilfering through their luggage.

00:10:09,449 --> 00:10:11,150
So are we.

00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,386
That's why we've solved
these problems forever.

00:10:13,386 --> 00:10:15,355
Introducing Lugless--

00:10:15,355 --> 00:10:17,223
A door-to-door
luggage shipping service

00:10:17,223 --> 00:10:20,860
that picks up your luggage
from your home, office, or hotel

00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,596
and sends it to wherever
you're going ahead of time.

00:10:23,596 --> 00:10:24,764
And when your trip is over,

00:10:24,764 --> 00:10:25,932
we'll pick your luggage
right back up

00:10:25,932 --> 00:10:27,300
and send it on home for you.

00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,402
We send luggage
to over 200 countries

00:10:29,402 --> 00:10:31,137
365 days a year.

00:10:31,137 --> 00:10:33,573
We sleep, eat, and breathe
luggage shipping.

00:10:33,573 --> 00:10:35,508
Our mission is to be
the voice of reason

00:10:35,508 --> 00:10:37,777
in a world gone mad
with baggage fees

00:10:37,777 --> 00:10:40,179
and bring back
the joy of traveling

00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:41,514
for millions of passengers

00:10:41,514 --> 00:10:43,316
who deserve
a better travel experience

00:10:43,316 --> 00:10:45,952
with or without
a first-class ticket.

00:10:45,952 --> 00:10:50,056
Brian, hasn't this been done?
It's called Fedex.

00:10:50,056 --> 00:10:51,924
(Lori) Mm-hmm.
It has.
Fedex does do shipping.

00:10:51,924 --> 00:10:53,359
But not like us.

00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:54,794
Okay, what's the difference?

00:10:54,794 --> 00:10:56,629
The difference is, is that
we have a proprietary system

00:10:56,629 --> 00:10:59,132
and we have
service flexibility.

00:10:59,132 --> 00:11:00,500
Sorry. Sorry.
Fedex--

00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,603
Fedex, $40-Billion company,
I believe, last year,

00:11:03,603 --> 00:11:06,739
they don't have anything
proprietary or a service--

00:11:06,739 --> 00:11:08,274
of course they do. I probably
shouldn't have led with that.

00:11:08,274 --> 00:11:10,610
Most importantly
is service flexibility.

00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:13,112
Some of the differences--Let's
talk about price real quick--

00:11:13,112 --> 00:11:16,582
Is any express or international,
we're 20% to 60% less

00:11:16,582 --> 00:11:18,117
than if you went directly
to Fedex.

00:11:18,117 --> 00:11:19,352
'cause your bulk buying?

00:11:19,352 --> 00:11:20,853
We're bulk buying.
We have deep discounts.

00:11:20,853 --> 00:11:22,388
Okay, so walk me through it.

00:11:22,388 --> 00:11:24,090
Okay, so let's say, Mark,
you're going to new York...

00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,391
okay.

00:11:25,391 --> 00:11:26,559
For an upcoming Mavericks,
uh, knicks game.

00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:27,827
Right.

00:11:27,827 --> 00:11:29,062
All right. Um, your private jet
is in the shop,

00:11:29,062 --> 00:11:30,363
so you have to fly commercial.

00:11:30,363 --> 00:11:31,531
Whoa.
Oh, my--

00:11:31,531 --> 00:11:32,932
That's not gonna happen,
so go ahead.

00:11:32,932 --> 00:11:34,600
You don't want to lug
your bag

00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,736
and you want it waiting for you
at your hotel when you arrive.

00:11:36,736 --> 00:11:38,071
Perfect.
Right.

00:11:38,071 --> 00:11:39,572
So first you go online,

00:11:39,572 --> 00:11:41,140
sign up
in less than five minutes.

00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,341
And then...

00:11:42,341 --> 00:11:44,777
you receive a packet
from Lugless at your door.

00:11:44,777 --> 00:11:46,679
You open it up...

00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:49,549
and you place the reusable
plastic luggage tag

00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:52,618
on the handle of the suitcase
that you're sending.

00:11:52,618 --> 00:11:54,454
Okay, well, there's--
There's a red flag right there.

00:11:54,454 --> 00:11:57,056
How long does it take for me
to get the--the package?

00:11:57,056 --> 00:11:58,391
Overnight.

00:11:58,391 --> 00:11:59,959
So you can't help me
right now?

00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:02,061
Absolutely.
You don't need this packet.

00:12:02,061 --> 00:12:03,896
If you don't want it
and you need it out that day,

00:12:03,896 --> 00:12:06,132
we have drop-off locations
or we can schedule

00:12:06,132 --> 00:12:08,267
a private pickup with, uh,
one of our couriers.

00:12:08,267 --> 00:12:09,602
So, you know,
we have a big company,

00:12:09,602 --> 00:12:11,070
so we have
our own Fedex account.

00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,371
Sure.

00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:14,040
So you're gearing it
towards individuals.

00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,641
We are, but we're also

00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:17,877
gearing it towards corporations
and companies--
You're saying

00:12:17,877 --> 00:12:21,047
you could ship my stuff
cheaper than I could with Fedex.

00:12:21,047 --> 00:12:22,715
Uh, I'm gonna say, even though
you have a large company,

00:12:22,715 --> 00:12:24,584
we have
very competitive rates.

00:12:24,584 --> 00:12:26,085
You have to ship somebody
a package first,

00:12:26,085 --> 00:12:27,253
so that's a cost.

00:12:27,253 --> 00:12:28,588
Yep.

00:12:28,588 --> 00:12:30,590
Sometimes you have to have
a local delivery service

00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,091
come there,

00:12:32,091 --> 00:12:35,461
and then you still have the main
shipping of the luggage.

00:12:35,461 --> 00:12:37,730
How do you add
all that in there and it's--

00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,632
You're still cheaper
than Fedex or U.P.S.?

00:12:39,632 --> 00:12:40,800
Well, for those--
Those are add-ons,

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,101
and those are
for those customers

00:12:42,101 --> 00:12:43,269
that want a little bit more
white-glove service

00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:44,504
and they're willing
to spend that.

00:12:44,504 --> 00:12:46,005
What did you sell last year?

00:12:46,005 --> 00:12:49,008
This year, $215,000 so far,
to date. 10 months.

00:12:49,008 --> 00:12:50,810
That's gross or your net?
In revenue.

00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:53,212
That's gross.
Net is around $70,000 so far.

00:12:53,212 --> 00:12:54,714
Have you tried to partner
with airlines,

00:12:54,714 --> 00:12:56,449
saying that
this is more convenient,

00:12:56,449 --> 00:12:58,484
and give them a piece
of the action?

00:12:58,484 --> 00:12:59,986
Not at this point.

00:12:59,986 --> 00:13:01,320
We're trying to partner with
travel-related companies--

00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,055
Travel agents, hotels--

00:13:03,055 --> 00:13:04,824
Well, what's more travel related
than an airline?
Well, they're--

00:13:04,824 --> 00:13:06,459
(Lori) Travelocity--

00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:07,960
they're collecting $3.4 billion
on baggage fees, so right now--

00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,862
Yeah, but, you know, they're
aware of what you're doing.

00:13:09,862 --> 00:13:11,364
They know what Fedex is doing.

00:13:11,364 --> 00:13:13,366
They may consider you
to be an ally

00:13:13,366 --> 00:13:14,767
if you gave them
a piece of it.

00:13:14,767 --> 00:13:16,269
I-I think it's a great idea.

00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:17,770
We just haven't led with that
because we're focused

00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,772
on hotel chains,
travel agents,

00:13:19,772 --> 00:13:23,109
uh, concierge services,
uh, travel portals.

00:13:23,109 --> 00:13:24,510
That's really our market.

00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,412
So am I correct--

00:13:26,412 --> 00:13:29,015
You're in
the problem-solving business?

00:13:29,015 --> 00:13:30,449
I have my golf clubs.
I call you.

00:13:30,449 --> 00:13:32,885
A guy comes,
puts 'em in whatever,

00:13:32,885 --> 00:13:35,154
takes care of 'em,
they show up.

00:13:35,154 --> 00:13:36,322
I don't have to do anything.

00:13:36,322 --> 00:13:37,490
Nothing.
It's all handled.

00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,991
So it's a--
It's a premium service.

00:13:38,991 --> 00:13:42,628
It's not geared towards somebody
who cares about cost.

00:13:42,628 --> 00:13:43,963
Am I right?

00:13:43,963 --> 00:13:45,264
No, you're wrong. Right now,
with the baggage fees,

00:13:45,264 --> 00:13:46,732
second, third, and fourth bags

00:13:46,732 --> 00:13:49,502
sometimes is more expensive
than what we charge,

00:13:49,502 --> 00:13:50,837
especially for the--
What do you charge for...

00:13:50,837 --> 00:13:52,872
sure.
An average-Size suitcase?

00:13:52,872 --> 00:13:54,373
Sure. So this--

00:13:54,373 --> 00:13:55,508
Like point to them.

00:13:55,508 --> 00:13:56,709
This would be carry-on.

00:13:56,709 --> 00:13:58,144
That's $39 flat rate,
anywhere in the U.S.

00:13:58,144 --> 00:14:00,346
Um, the standard bag,
that's $59.

00:14:00,346 --> 00:14:03,382
Uh, this let's say oversized,
that would be $99.

00:14:03,382 --> 00:14:05,084
Surf Board's $149.

00:14:05,084 --> 00:14:06,652
Uh, and then golf clubs
are $89.

00:14:06,652 --> 00:14:08,154
(Mark)
But you're not--You're not

00:14:08,154 --> 00:14:11,023
the only luggage shipping
service that's available online.

00:14:11,023 --> 00:14:12,491
Absolutely not.
We're the best brand,

00:14:12,491 --> 00:14:13,926
and we're definitely
the fastest growing.

00:14:13,926 --> 00:14:15,928
(Kevin) The question is,
how do I value this business?

00:14:15,928 --> 00:14:17,530
How do I know that...

00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:21,367
for $100,000, I shouldn't be
getting 60% of it?

00:14:21,367 --> 00:14:22,702
We have a lot of partnerships
that are pending.

00:14:22,702 --> 00:14:24,070
I have a letter of interest

00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,538
from a company called
secure wrap.

00:14:25,538 --> 00:14:27,607
And what do they want to do?

00:14:27,607 --> 00:14:29,375
They want to put, um,
our Lugless kiosks

00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,510
that we'll--We'll have
next to them

00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,479
in, um, in the airports
with them.

00:14:33,479 --> 00:14:35,514
So they package your bag,
and they want us to be with them

00:14:35,514 --> 00:14:38,651
to fulfill service for them
in their 53 airports.

00:14:38,651 --> 00:14:40,186
We'd get business there...
but...

00:14:40,186 --> 00:14:41,621
and We'd also--

00:14:41,621 --> 00:14:42,955
Why couldn't they just
create an account with Fedex

00:14:42,955 --> 00:14:44,390
and do the same thing?

00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,725
They don't want to get
into the logistics of it.

00:14:45,725 --> 00:14:46,893
They don't want
to worry about

00:14:46,893 --> 00:14:48,060
if there needs to be
a private courier,

00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,228
which is one of the levels
of service

00:14:49,228 --> 00:14:50,563
that makes us different.

00:14:50,563 --> 00:14:51,898
They don't want to do it.
They want it--

00:14:51,898 --> 00:14:53,599
so let's say--Let's say
this comes to fruition.

00:14:53,599 --> 00:14:55,902
Right? You've gotta
set up a kiosk right there

00:14:55,902 --> 00:14:58,771
and hire employees to be there
all the time.

00:14:58,771 --> 00:15:02,408
You're gonna have to--to pack
and ship a whole lot of luggage.

00:15:02,408 --> 00:15:03,576
We're--We're actually,

00:15:03,576 --> 00:15:05,544
I mean, the kiosk idea
is as simple

00:15:05,544 --> 00:15:07,980
as just a tablet, uh,
where you can sign up--

00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,682
but then someone--Then someone's
gotta deal with

00:15:09,682 --> 00:15:11,317
getting your courier
or whoever

00:15:11,317 --> 00:15:14,287
to take it
to wherever it needs to go.

00:15:14,287 --> 00:15:17,556
I-I don't see it
any more than a premium service.

00:15:17,556 --> 00:15:20,893
Because it's not gonna be
less money than the airlines.

00:15:20,893 --> 00:15:23,963
When you add the local courier,
a guy picking it up,

00:15:23,963 --> 00:15:26,299
customer service--
"Hey, Brian, where's my bag?"

00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:28,134
it's--right now it is.
It's a premium service

00:15:28,134 --> 00:15:30,202
that's going to slowly get
more to the masses

00:15:30,202 --> 00:15:33,639
when the baggage fees continue
to remain where they are.

00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:35,708
And you're--You're incorrect
by saying We're more expensive.

00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,376
We're not.
We're cost effective and--

00:15:37,376 --> 00:15:39,645
but I don't--
I don't see it.

00:15:39,645 --> 00:15:40,813
I'm out.

00:15:40,813 --> 00:15:42,982
Okay. Thank you.

00:15:42,982 --> 00:15:45,384
The model kinds

00:15:45,384 --> 00:15:47,053
of reminds me of what happens

00:15:47,053 --> 00:15:49,221
in the cellular telephone
market.

00:15:49,221 --> 00:15:51,791
A new brand carrier
like a virgin

00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,292
sits on top
of the infrastructure

00:15:53,292 --> 00:15:55,094
of another company,

00:15:55,094 --> 00:15:58,064
and sells
for very thin margins.

00:15:58,064 --> 00:16:00,066
You're doing the same thing
on top of Fedex.

00:16:00,066 --> 00:16:01,534
I think
what happens over time is,

00:16:01,534 --> 00:16:05,137
maybe you scale,
but your margins get crushed.

00:16:05,137 --> 00:16:06,806
I think that's the challenge,

00:16:06,806 --> 00:16:08,474
because anybody can do this.

00:16:08,474 --> 00:16:09,608
And I'm not saying you won't

00:16:09,608 --> 00:16:10,910
as you run
for building this brand.

00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:14,046
I've never heard of Lugless.
I travel a lot.

00:16:14,046 --> 00:16:16,048
I personally, if I owned
a piece of this company,

00:16:16,048 --> 00:16:18,050
would push for an airline deal.

00:16:19,385 --> 00:16:21,287
I'm out.

00:16:21,287 --> 00:16:24,056
(mouths word)

00:16:24,056 --> 00:16:26,892
You're asking for $100,000
for 10% of the company.

00:16:26,892 --> 00:16:29,261
So you're saying that
the company's worth

00:16:29,261 --> 00:16:30,896
a million dollars.

00:16:30,896 --> 00:16:32,331
Um, why is that?

00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:33,733
I'm asking that for
a couple of different reasons.

00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:36,202
Uh, one is the system
that we've created.

00:16:36,202 --> 00:16:38,137
If you did what we did on
the open market and created it,

00:16:38,137 --> 00:16:40,306
it's about $200,000,
$250,000.

00:16:40,306 --> 00:16:42,708
Then we have these partnerships
that we're talking about.

00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,643
You have that contract already?

00:16:44,643 --> 00:16:47,179
No, because we have hotel chains
that we're speaking with,

00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:49,081
their looking for
a fully integrated

00:16:49,081 --> 00:16:50,583
Lugless operation.

00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,018
I got it. I-I understand.
Um...

00:16:52,018 --> 00:16:53,152
I'm out.

00:16:53,152 --> 00:16:55,087
Thank you.

00:16:56,555 --> 00:16:58,691
I love
your entrepreneurial spirit.

00:16:58,691 --> 00:17:01,027
And I do think
it's a good idea.

00:17:01,027 --> 00:17:02,828
But for me,
the problem is,

00:17:02,828 --> 00:17:05,131
you're up against too big
a fish right now.

00:17:05,131 --> 00:17:06,832
And for that reason,
I'm out.

00:17:06,832 --> 00:17:08,734
Thank you.

00:17:10,302 --> 00:17:12,671
Mark?

00:17:12,671 --> 00:17:15,074
You know, I typically like
software plays like this

00:17:15,074 --> 00:17:16,509
that are scalable.

00:17:16,509 --> 00:17:19,478
Um, but...

00:17:19,478 --> 00:17:23,449
you have one huge,
huge problem.

00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:25,951
You've got other competitors
that are bigger

00:17:25,951 --> 00:17:28,554
and have more
marketing strength than you do.

00:17:28,554 --> 00:17:30,022
You're gonna get crushed.

00:17:30,022 --> 00:17:32,691
You need an angle
that differentiates you

00:17:32,691 --> 00:17:34,560
and just smacks people
in the face--

00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,430
Quick, easy, cheap, now.

00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,931
And I don't think you've come
close to doing that,

00:17:38,931 --> 00:17:40,433
and you didn't give me
any indication

00:17:40,433 --> 00:17:42,168
that you're going to do that,
so I'm out.

00:17:42,168 --> 00:17:45,871
All right.
Thank you very much.

00:17:45,871 --> 00:17:47,039
Appreciate it.
Good luck, Brian.

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,207
Thanks.

(exhales)

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,648
I don't think they understood

00:17:55,648 --> 00:17:57,183
that it's not
just about the price,

00:17:57,183 --> 00:17:58,684
it's not just about
the network,

00:17:58,684 --> 00:18:00,019
that it's about the industry

00:18:00,019 --> 00:18:01,754

a growing industry.

I would describe myself

Any blow to this road

Ohh.

00:18:24,643 --> 00:18:26,745
I'm obsessed with all

Like all good invention,
it comes from a wife's ire.

My wife was irritated
by the... (speaks indistinctly)

00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,878
That was sprinkled
around her home.

00:18:51,878 --> 00:18:53,847
I realized I should fix it
if I want to remain married

00:18:53,847 --> 00:18:55,148

00:18:55,148 --> 00:18:56,950

So I'm a geek.

But as a geek, I am compelled
to define that nebulous word.

00:19:45,632 --> 00:19:47,467
A geek is simply someone
who's obsessively curious

00:19:47,467 --> 00:19:49,002
about one or more topics.

00:19:49,002 --> 00:19:50,871

my controllers in baskets

00:20:12,271 --> 00:20:14,506
invading our lives
on comic wednesdays.

00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:16,508
But I could see
that it aggravated her,

00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:18,977
and in a rare moment
of marital insight...

00:20:18,977 --> 00:20:21,513
(bell chimes)
I realized
that she deserved better.

00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:24,750
So I started designing
beautiful, geeky furniture

00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,585
that would be at home
in our home.

00:20:26,585 --> 00:20:28,253
But then I had
a more startling revelation--

00:20:28,253 --> 00:20:30,122
that we all deserve better.

00:20:30,122 --> 00:20:32,458
Well, and that's where
geek chic comes in.

00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:36,328
This is a black walnut
3X5 emissary dining table,

00:20:36,328 --> 00:20:39,498
but like many good things geek,
it's more than meets the eye.

00:20:39,498 --> 00:20:42,334
So if I reach back
down here,

00:20:42,334 --> 00:20:45,738
with the push of a button,
I reveal a second surface.

00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:50,943
This surface can be used
for card games

00:20:50,943 --> 00:20:53,645
or board games
or anything you want to do,

00:20:53,645 --> 00:20:54,980
in progress or in storage.

00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,315
If I pull out of this drawer,

00:20:56,315 --> 00:20:57,783
it becomes a desk,

00:20:57,783 --> 00:21:00,753
and the desk
is good for laptops

00:21:00,753 --> 00:21:03,322
or for running
a role-playing game.

00:21:03,322 --> 00:21:04,990
We also have this rail

00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,626

Geeks, by accident or design,

and Geek Chic is the brand

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,009

and shape it with them.

and hopefully geeks,

00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:30,582
what do you need to know
to become a part of geek chic?

00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:32,017
(laughs)

00:21:32,017 --> 00:21:34,153
Is this your only product
or do you have more products?

00:21:34,153 --> 00:21:35,387
No, no, we have--

00:21:35,387 --> 00:21:36,889
This is one of, uh,
19 pieces of furniture

00:21:36,889 --> 00:21:38,423
that we currently offer.

00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:39,758
(Robert) Can I see it?
(Lori) Yeah, I was gonna say--

00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:41,093
So they're all tables
and cabinets at the moment,

00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:42,394
or are there also chairs or--

00:21:42,394 --> 00:21:44,663
We do chairs as well,
absolutely.

00:21:44,663 --> 00:21:46,431
Oh, this is really cool.

00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:48,433
And this is the desk?
Yep.

00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:50,068
Wow. Very clever.

00:21:50,068 --> 00:21:52,070
Do you customize them,
what's inside here?

00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:54,740
So it could be a poker table,
it could be a crap table,

00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,941
it could be...
right.

00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:57,376
Whatever you decide to order?

00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,777
Yeah, absolutely.

00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:00,179
That's what--You're seeing
two examples there.

00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:01,713
There's a wet-dry-erase surface
that's over,

00:22:01,713 --> 00:22:03,549
uh, one of our maps.
(Robert) Oh, look at this.

00:22:03,549 --> 00:22:04,883
That thing--
Yeah, that just comes out.

00:22:04,883 --> 00:22:06,385
That would be--you could have
that full inset

00:22:06,385 --> 00:22:08,320
for playing cards on.

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,521
What does this cost?

00:22:09,521 --> 00:22:10,923
Uh, about $3,500,
I would say.

00:22:10,923 --> 00:22:12,090
Wow, that's reasonable...
Mm-hmm.

00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,258
For this quality.

00:22:13,258 --> 00:22:14,426
How many sales do you have?

00:22:14,426 --> 00:22:16,962
We did $2 million
in sales last year.

00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:18,997
Wow.
Th--Yes.

00:22:18,997 --> 00:22:20,098
Impressive.

00:22:20,098 --> 00:22:21,633
What was your profit?

00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:22,901
We were negative.

00:22:22,901 --> 00:22:24,169
We were in the red by $100,000
on $2 million.

00:22:24,169 --> 00:22:26,405
Whoa.

00:22:26,405 --> 00:22:29,208
We know what furniture
manufacturers are worth.

00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:31,910
5 times free cash.

00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,712
Sure.
You don't have any free cash.

00:22:33,712 --> 00:22:35,781
Why are you worth $2 million?

00:22:35,781 --> 00:22:38,584
I'm worth more
than $2 million.

00:22:38,584 --> 00:22:42,421
The $2 million is what we did
in revenue last fiscal year.

00:22:42,421 --> 00:22:44,790
So what are your projected
cash flows for this year?

00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:48,393
Um, I believe that our projected
is about $400,000 or $500,000.

00:22:48,393 --> 00:22:51,330
And what are you gonna use
the $100,000 from us for?

00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,232
Well, I'm gonna use it
to probably buy a truck

00:22:53,232 --> 00:22:54,967
to expand
our shipping operations

00:22:54,967 --> 00:22:57,035
and probably put on--
Get some more machinery

00:22:57,035 --> 00:22:59,972
in the facility
to increase our efficiencies.

00:22:59,972 --> 00:23:01,473
What is your average order?

00:23:01,473 --> 00:23:04,543
Uh, our average order's about
$4,000, $4,500.

00:23:04,543 --> 00:23:06,712
So how much are your margins,
then, on that table?

00:23:06,712 --> 00:23:09,915
Uh, about--Well, this is about
$1,800 to make a $3,500 table.

00:23:09,915 --> 00:23:12,017
So about 50%?
Yes.

00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:13,185
The furniture manufacturing
sector

00:23:13,185 --> 00:23:14,519
has been decimated in America.

00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,154
Yes.
It's all in Asia now.

00:23:16,154 --> 00:23:19,758
Why are you staying alive?
Why are you not a dead geek?

00:23:19,758 --> 00:23:21,827
Because I am not trying
to compete with China.

00:23:21,827 --> 00:23:24,263
China does what they do
very, very well.

00:23:24,263 --> 00:23:25,464
But they aren't gonna
be able to make

00:23:25,464 --> 00:23:26,965
North American
fully hardwood furniture

00:23:26,965 --> 00:23:28,934
in the same kind of way
at a competitive level.

00:23:28,934 --> 00:23:30,235
They can't do that.

00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,605
(Lori)
I-I think you're great.

00:23:33,605 --> 00:23:35,107
I love your enthusiasm.

00:23:35,107 --> 00:23:37,809
This is a beautiful table,
really beautiful.

00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:40,545
I've seen
a lot of tables similar.

00:23:40,545 --> 00:23:41,880
I'm just not sure
how you're gonna get

00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,548
the competitive edge
on top of them

00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:45,984
because some of them
are very high-end.

00:23:45,984 --> 00:23:49,221
So for that reason,
I'm out.

00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:50,722
Okay.

00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:53,492
Robert, do you want to sell this
to a lot of people

00:23:53,492 --> 00:23:57,329
or do you want to stay
very niche-oriented,

00:23:57,329 --> 00:24:00,999
make very high-end stuff,
maybe grow to $10 million,

00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:03,001
and just keep it at that?

00:24:03,001 --> 00:24:04,503
This company's gonna be
a lot bigger than $10 million.

00:24:04,503 --> 00:24:06,705
And we--I want to sell it
to a lot more than--

00:24:06,705 --> 00:24:08,106
Than just geeks.

00:24:08,106 --> 00:24:09,608
Everyone's looking at this
and going,

00:24:09,608 --> 00:24:11,944
"Man, that is nice.
I really do want--I want that.

00:24:11,944 --> 00:24:13,278
That's something"--

00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:14,613
see, that--That's where
I disconnect, Robert.

00:24:14,613 --> 00:24:17,049
I look at that and say,
"That's a table," you know?

00:24:17,049 --> 00:24:19,351
I don't--I don't see
anything more there.

00:24:19,351 --> 00:24:20,852
Do you see the functionality,
though? Do you see it, Mark?

00:24:20,852 --> 00:24:22,187
Do you see that--that--
That's the part--

00:24:22,187 --> 00:24:23,689
that part of this is,
is about describing

00:24:23,689 --> 00:24:25,424
very specific function
for people?

00:24:25,424 --> 00:24:27,159
I mean, I see
what you're trying--Look...
this may not be for you--

00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:28,460
for me to get into a business,

00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,629
I've gotta be relentless
and dive in.

00:24:30,629 --> 00:24:32,130
This sounds like you're
trailing down to "No, sir."

00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:33,632
Yeah, I'm just telling you...
think about it for a second.

00:24:33,632 --> 00:24:35,867
If--if it was Geek Chic
in another direction...
I--this--

00:24:35,867 --> 00:24:37,569
but furniture?

00:24:37,569 --> 00:24:38,737
I'm--That's just not me.

00:24:38,737 --> 00:24:39,905
I--geek furniture is
the beginning

00:24:39,905 --> 00:24:41,340
of what we're doing.

00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,507
It is absolutely the beginning
of what we're doing.

00:24:42,507 --> 00:24:44,476
Well, when you get
to the rest of it...

00:24:44,476 --> 00:24:46,311
give you a call?
Give me a call,
but I'm out.

00:24:46,311 --> 00:24:47,612
Fair enough. Fair enough.

00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:49,614
Robert, let me, uh,

00:24:49,614 --> 00:24:52,517
let--Let me tell you where
I differ with your vision...

00:24:52,517 --> 00:24:55,887
that you want to be
a big furniture guy.

00:24:55,887 --> 00:24:57,155
I don't want to be
a big furniture guy.

00:24:57,155 --> 00:24:58,390
I want to be
a big company.

00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:00,659
I buy into the design,
but I don't buy into

00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:02,227
the furniture company
part of it.

00:25:02,227 --> 00:25:03,362
I'm out.

00:25:03,362 --> 00:25:05,364
Okay.

00:25:05,364 --> 00:25:07,566
I have a story
about biology class...
(laughs)

00:25:07,566 --> 00:25:09,468
That may be relevant to this.
(laughs)

00:25:09,468 --> 00:25:10,736
okay.

00:25:10,736 --> 00:25:12,070
I remember once
counting fruit flies

00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,572
in a petri dish
with a microscope.

00:25:13,572 --> 00:25:14,940
(laughs) I can't
picture that.

00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,209
And after doing about
a hundred of them

00:25:17,209 --> 00:25:18,810
with my little tweezer,
I found one that was not black.

00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,079
It was white.
It was clear white.

00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:23,548
And I held it up
for the teacher and I said,

00:25:23,548 --> 00:25:25,684
"What is this doing with
the rest of my fruit flies?"

00:25:25,684 --> 00:25:28,987
and he said,
"That's an anomaly."

00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:30,589
You're that fruit fly.

00:25:30,589 --> 00:25:31,757
You're the anomaly.

00:25:31,757 --> 00:25:34,726
You're in
a really crappy business,

00:25:34,726 --> 00:25:37,129
who got decimated over
the last 20 years in America.

00:25:37,129 --> 00:25:38,463
But if you try and become
a furniture company,

00:25:38,463 --> 00:25:39,798
You'll be like
all the other fruit flies--

00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:40,966
Dead in the petri dish.

00:25:40,966 --> 00:25:42,167
That's what I believe.

00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:43,668
I don't think you should
raise any money

00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:45,570
or give up any equity.

00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:47,906
You should just be
a happy fruit fly.

00:25:47,906 --> 00:25:49,174
I'm out.

00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:52,110
Okay.

00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,478
Four sharks are out.

00:25:53,478 --> 00:25:55,847
Oh, yes, Daymond.

00:25:55,847 --> 00:25:58,750
I just don't know if we're
gonna have the same vision.

00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,085
If you do this geek angle,

00:26:00,085 --> 00:26:02,521
I just don't know
if I can ride with that.

00:26:02,521 --> 00:26:04,489
But I real--I'm in love
with the stuff,

00:26:04,489 --> 00:26:07,259
and I'm--I'm in love with how
you're running the company.

00:26:09,227 --> 00:26:11,596
You asked for $100,000
for 5%?

00:26:11,596 --> 00:26:13,465
You're right.

00:26:13,465 --> 00:26:16,435
I'm giving you an offer
of $200,000... (exhales)

00:26:16,435 --> 00:26:18,203
for 25%.

00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:23,041
Now I-I mostly made the offer
at $100,000 for 5%

00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,976
because I was, you know,
counting the value

00:26:24,976 --> 00:26:28,814
that any shark could bring
to my business, for sure.

00:26:28,814 --> 00:26:31,683
Uh, how about...

00:26:31,683 --> 00:26:35,620
uh, $500,000 for 15%?

00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,355
(Robert) So, Robert,
you're raising your value.

00:26:37,355 --> 00:26:39,858
You've gone from
$2-Million value on the company

00:26:39,858 --> 00:26:41,326
to 3.3.

00:26:41,326 --> 00:26:43,495
Yes, and I still think that
that's probably undervalued.

00:26:43,495 --> 00:26:45,664
Now I'm finding a flaw
in your character.

00:26:45,664 --> 00:26:48,100
You see, you came in here
and you offered that--

00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,868
not a flaw in my character,
sir.

00:26:49,868 --> 00:26:52,404
Robert, hang on a sec.
Are you considering his offer?

00:26:52,404 --> 00:26:55,006
No. No, I'm--I'm--
I'm countering with a diff--

00:26:55,006 --> 00:26:56,875
All right. I'm gonna have to
stay firm on that offer.

00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:58,844
My ticket to enter

00:26:58,844 --> 00:27:02,681
is my time and $200,000
and 25%.

00:27:02,681 --> 00:27:06,518
Uh, 25%--It's--
25% is Still too high.

00:27:06,518 --> 00:27:08,353
Yeah, then it comes down
to a "Yes" Or "No," Robert.

00:27:08,353 --> 00:27:09,521
We're great partners, man.

00:27:09,521 --> 00:27:12,457
You're 75%. I'm 25%.

00:27:14,593 --> 00:27:16,228
Be true to yourself.

00:27:19,197 --> 00:27:20,432
Robert, I'll give you
more cash.

00:27:22,234 --> 00:27:25,837
♪♪

00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,033
Four sharks are out.

00:27:34,033 --> 00:27:36,736
Daymond's made an offer
of $200,000

00:27:36,736 --> 00:27:38,471
for a 25% stake.

00:27:38,471 --> 00:27:40,473
But Robert may have had
a change of heart.

00:27:40,473 --> 00:27:42,208
Robert, I'll give you
more cash.

00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:47,546
I'll give you $300,000
for 25%.

00:27:49,615 --> 00:27:51,217
My vision
is slightly different.

00:27:51,217 --> 00:27:53,753
I gotta tell you, when you have
something beautiful and rare,

00:27:53,753 --> 00:27:55,488
you can charge more for it.

00:27:55,488 --> 00:27:57,523
Did you just jump in
on my geek?

00:27:57,523 --> 00:27:59,058
I sure did.
He did.

00:27:59,058 --> 00:28:01,427
(Kevin) Well, let's summarize
what you've got here.

00:28:01,427 --> 00:28:05,030
Daymond made you an offer
of $200,000 for 25%,

00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:08,400
valuing your company
at $800,000.

00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,503
And while you were whining
about that,

00:28:10,503 --> 00:28:14,573
Robert made you an offer
for $300,000 for 25%,

00:28:14,573 --> 00:28:17,910

00:28:23,382 --> 00:28:25,384
I cannot, because my time
is worth...

00:28:25,384 --> 00:28:26,986
because your time is--

00:28:26,986 --> 00:28:28,988

That's completely fair.

00:28:28,988 --> 00:28:31,157
Uh, so..

00:28:31,157 --> 00:28:33,759

Really, I appreciate

You want 25% of my company,

really understand it...
yes.

What--what's a trunk show?

00:34:02,817 --> 00:34:06,054
A trunk show is where
the store asks you to come up

00:34:06,054 --> 00:34:10,325
and set up your stuff exactly--
sort of like we have here,

00:34:10,325 --> 00:34:12,327
and we would stand there
as designers

00:34:12,327 --> 00:34:15,363
and just talk to
the end customer about our line,

00:34:15,363 --> 00:34:17,966
show them how it works, um--

00:34:17,966 --> 00:34:20,135
Did Bloomingdale
pick it up then?

00:34:20,135 --> 00:34:22,804
The national buyer was
so impressed with our sales,

00:34:22,804 --> 00:34:26,808
she does not doubt that we could
triple, if not more, our sales.

00:34:26,808 --> 00:34:29,611
And she's confirmed
three additional trunk shows

00:34:29,611 --> 00:34:31,713
for, um, our brand.

00:34:31,713 --> 00:34:34,749
Why would they keep asking you
to come back and do trunk shows

00:34:34,749 --> 00:34:37,085
and simply not pick it up

00:34:37,085 --> 00:34:38,420
and distribute it
throughout Bloomingdale's?

00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,754
They're testing.
They're taking you broader.

00:34:39,754 --> 00:34:41,523
Right.
Right.

00:34:41,523 --> 00:34:43,158
They're trying to see
how people are reacting--

00:34:43,158 --> 00:34:44,325
'cause they're not sure.
Well--

00:34:44,325 --> 00:34:45,693
What are the average prices?

00:34:45,693 --> 00:34:49,864

anywhere from $50 to $375.

00:34:49,864 --> 00:34:52,000

00:34:54,502 --> 00:34:57,172
I actually do more

00:34:57,172 --> 00:34:59,407
um, but we collaborate
on the design.

00:34:59,407 --> 00:35:01,042
We kind of pass things
back and forth

00:35:01,042 --> 00:35:03,912
and then, uh, decide
on our collection.

00:35:03,912 --> 00:35:06,648
We basically have
three collections here,

00:35:06,648 --> 00:35:10,018
so our first collection
was all create your own,

00:35:10,018 --> 00:35:15,089
and you actually can unscrew
all of these charms

00:35:15,089 --> 00:35:18,593
so that the customer
can create their own.

00:35:18,593 --> 00:35:21,663
So buy extra ones
and put 'em in?
That's looks good on you, Lori.

all the way up
to your $375 item?

00:35:28,403 --> 00:35:31,139
$3 to $45 per piece.

00:35:31,139 --> 00:35:34,576
Your $3 cost items you sell
retail for how much?

00:35:34,576 --> 00:35:36,845
Uh, $96.

00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:40,048
Sorry. Your retail is $96,

00:35:40,048 --> 00:35:42,383
Yes.
That's unbelievable margin.

00:35:43,618 --> 00:35:44,853

of your collections,

00:35:44,853 --> 00:35:46,387

00:35:46,387 --> 00:35:47,889
to help the people?

00:35:47,889 --> 00:35:50,558
We're asking for $150,000,

00:35:50,558 --> 00:35:53,495
and we did that for
a very specific reason.

00:35:53,495 --> 00:35:57,298
What we wanna do is to, um,

00:35:57,298 --> 00:35:59,734
take the idea
of the trunk show

00:35:59,734 --> 00:36:02,871
And, uh, replicate it
across many different stores.

00:36:02,871 --> 00:36:04,572
Why do you even need
to go there?
Why do you need to do
trunk shows?

00:36:04,572 --> 00:36:07,575
If--If Bloomingdale
likes the sales,

00:36:07,575 --> 00:36:10,011
why wouldn't they just pick
it up, sell it nationally?
They probably will.

00:36:10,011 --> 00:36:12,514
Eventually they will.
That's what we've been told.
This is--

00:36:12,514 --> 00:36:15,483
I see this absolutely
in a store like Bloomingdale's

00:36:15,483 --> 00:36:16,684
or Bendel.

00:36:16,684 --> 00:36:17,685
What does this sell for?

00:36:17,685 --> 00:36:18,820
$375 retail.

00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,054
Yeah. $375.
(Kevin) $375.

00:36:20,054 --> 00:36:21,556
We made it for $49.

00:36:21,556 --> 00:36:23,491
$49. Wow.

00:36:23,491 --> 00:36:24,993
It's all Swarovski Crystal.
So basically this is

00:36:24,993 --> 00:36:26,561
very expensive
costume jewelry, right?

00:36:26,561 --> 00:36:28,329
We have so many people
that come in here,

00:36:28,329 --> 00:36:30,932
trying to sell jewelry.
The tank is full of jewelry,

00:36:30,932 --> 00:36:34,002
but yours is different
because of where you came from.
(Lori) Mm-hmm.

00:36:34,002 --> 00:36:37,238
Right.
Well, here's the bad news.
You're not worth $600,000.

00:36:37,238 --> 00:36:38,506
We think we are.
So...

00:36:38,506 --> 00:36:39,974
I don't think so.

00:36:39,974 --> 00:36:41,509
And we've based that off

00:36:41,509 --> 00:36:44,746
of what we've made in the past,
and also the opportunities

00:36:44,746 --> 00:36:46,447
that we have--
You haven't made
anything yet.

00:36:46,447 --> 00:36:49,551
We've made $75,000
in revenue.
In sales.

00:36:49,551 --> 00:36:50,685
Exactly.
(Mark) ignore him.
You know what, guys?

00:36:50,685 --> 00:36:52,754
At some point, you just have
to look at somebody

00:36:52,754 --> 00:36:54,656
who just doesn't get it
and say, "Next?"

00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,858
So just ask him,
"are you in or are you out?"
(Ashley and Paige laugh)

00:36:56,858 --> 00:36:59,327
So the question is, you haven't
made any money yet, have you?

00:36:59,327 --> 00:37:02,697
If we can replicate
ten trunk shows

00:37:02,697 --> 00:37:05,199
across any retailer,
worst case scenario,

00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:08,503
we sell $500 a day revenue,

00:37:08,503 --> 00:37:12,240
we will generate in 60 days
$300,000.

00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,143
I can't get to your $600,000
valuation right now.

00:37:15,143 --> 00:37:18,479
I would never give you $150,000
for only 25%.

00:37:18,479 --> 00:37:20,949
To me, that's what
the whole thing's worth today.

00:37:20,949 --> 00:37:22,584
I'm out.

00:37:23,885 --> 00:37:25,587
What's your logic
for replicating yourselves

00:37:25,587 --> 00:37:27,622
as opposed to just
trying to get the big order

00:37:27,622 --> 00:37:29,891
in Bloomingdale's
or other retailers?

00:37:29,891 --> 00:37:31,926
We think we have to get
the name out there

00:37:31,926 --> 00:37:33,761
before you can just put it
on a shelf

00:37:33,761 --> 00:37:36,497
and people are coming in there
for Stella Valle.

00:37:36,497 --> 00:37:38,700
We don't have
that brand recognition yet.

00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,603
One of the hardest things
to build is a brand.

00:37:41,603 --> 00:37:42,704
Right.
Mm-hmm.

00:37:42,704 --> 00:37:44,606
I'm not sure I agree
with the strategy.

00:37:44,606 --> 00:37:46,107
I'm out.

00:37:48,643 --> 00:37:50,678
Just to talk to that point
a little bit, though.

00:37:50,678 --> 00:37:53,448
When we got into Henri Bendel
and Bloomingdale's,

00:37:53,448 --> 00:37:55,249
they didn't know our story.

00:37:55,249 --> 00:37:57,552
We went into an open call
and stood in line

00:37:57,552 --> 00:38:01,189
with 500 other designers,
and we went,

00:38:01,189 --> 00:38:03,658
and we showed our designs
to the buyer of Henri Bendel,

00:38:03,658 --> 00:38:06,194
and they loved our designs.

00:38:06,194 --> 00:38:08,429
They didn't know anything
about Ashley and I yet.

00:38:08,429 --> 00:38:11,232
And we are the brand,
and I think if we

00:38:11,232 --> 00:38:13,368
can get our story
out there,

00:38:13,368 --> 00:38:16,104
people will come seeking
our jewelry.

00:38:16,104 --> 00:38:18,539
Paige and Ashley, I think
it's--It's an amazing story,

00:38:18,539 --> 00:38:21,442
but, um...

00:38:21,442 --> 00:38:23,211
we both have
business degrees.

00:38:23,211 --> 00:38:24,379
We're ready to run
the company.

00:38:24,379 --> 00:38:25,913
We just need the money,

00:38:25,913 --> 00:38:27,248
and that's what
we want from you.
(Kevin laughs)

00:38:27,248 --> 00:38:28,916
And the connection.

00:38:28,916 --> 00:38:30,318
And--And any connection
you have.
Listen, you're--You're very...

00:38:30,318 --> 00:38:31,819
I'm gonna have to close
my eyes a minute,

00:38:31,819 --> 00:38:33,588
'cause you're gonna convince me,
which I don't want

00:38:33,588 --> 00:38:36,658
to be convinced.
Daymond, this girl served for 15
months in Afghanistan for you.

00:38:36,658 --> 00:38:37,925
All right.
Come on.

00:38:37,925 --> 00:38:39,027
For your freedom...
(laughter)

00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:40,895
So... ah--

00:38:40,895 --> 00:38:44,565
while you are making money!
You cannot back out on us.

00:38:44,565 --> 00:38:47,669
♪♪

00:38:52,974 --> 00:38:54,676
Two sharks are out,
and Paige and Ashley

00:38:54,676 --> 00:38:58,413
are trying to convince Daymond
not to become the third.

00:38:58,413 --> 00:38:59,847
Daymond,
we know that you can.

00:38:59,847 --> 00:39:00,915
I'm gonna have to close
my eyes a minute,

00:39:00,915 --> 00:39:02,517
'cause you're gonna
convince me,

00:39:02,517 --> 00:39:03,551
which I don't want
to be convinced.
Daymond, this girl served

00:39:03,551 --> 00:39:06,220
15 months in Afghanistan
for you.

00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,056
All right.
While you are making money...

00:39:08,056 --> 00:39:11,192
um...
she's getting shot at.
Come on.

00:39:11,192 --> 00:39:12,960
(Robert) Wow, guilt trip.

00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,429
You cannot back out on us.

00:39:14,429 --> 00:39:15,463
(Kevin) Oh, I love it.

00:39:15,463 --> 00:39:17,665
I love it.
Please don't.

00:39:17,665 --> 00:39:19,400
Mark? Lori?

00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,235
There's your vice president
of sales right there.
Come on.

00:39:21,235 --> 00:39:22,603
Listen, I have to be honest,

00:39:22,603 --> 00:39:25,506
but I really just don't like
the jewelry. I'm out.

00:39:27,442 --> 00:39:29,110
Lori.
Come on, Lori.

00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:31,546
Mark. Come on.

00:39:31,546 --> 00:39:34,649
I think there's something
very interesting here.

00:39:34,649 --> 00:39:36,050
I love your story.

00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:38,553
I love the combination
of all of it together.

00:39:38,553 --> 00:39:43,858
Everybody in our country
cares so much about all of you

00:39:43,858 --> 00:39:45,860
that have fought for us,

00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,462
and I think
there's something there.

00:39:47,462 --> 00:39:52,934
This being jewelry that's...
for women with power,

00:39:52,934 --> 00:39:55,002
but I also think, you know,
in my mind,

00:39:55,002 --> 00:39:59,340
if a percentage of the proceeds
went to the military...

00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:02,009
we actually designed, um,
a screw

00:40:02,009 --> 00:40:04,479
in the create-your-own,
which is a star,

00:40:04,479 --> 00:40:05,713
and it's engraved "U.S.A."

00:40:05,713 --> 00:40:07,749
and we donate a portion
of the proceeds

00:40:07,749 --> 00:40:09,884
to the Wounded Warrior Project.

00:40:09,884 --> 00:40:13,988
Um, and Ashley actually
mentors a wounded soldier.

00:40:13,988 --> 00:40:15,723
I love these girls, Mark,

00:40:15,723 --> 00:40:19,393
and I think that there is
something special here.

00:40:19,393 --> 00:40:21,129
I think the jewelry
is great-looking.

00:40:21,129 --> 00:40:24,832
I think that we could
design even more things

00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:28,936
that could be this cool, edgy,
powerful kind of jewelry

00:40:28,936 --> 00:40:31,539
from your background.
You can't pay $600,000
for this.

00:40:31,539 --> 00:40:37,078
But, Mark... would you like
to go in with me?

00:40:37,078 --> 00:40:39,347
I think that we can...
all together make this is a hit.

00:40:39,347 --> 00:40:43,284
Do you see this
as a QVC product?
I think it could be, yes.

00:40:43,284 --> 00:40:44,786
See, I-I actually like
the fact that it might not be

00:40:44,786 --> 00:40:46,020
a QVC product.

00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,022
I think they need everything,
Mark.

00:40:48,022 --> 00:40:50,992
My gut feeling
is you need stores.

00:40:50,992 --> 00:40:53,661
I think QVC would give you
free advertising

00:40:53,661 --> 00:40:55,596
and get your name
and your brand out there,

00:40:55,596 --> 00:40:59,901
and you can create
special pieces just for QVC.

00:40:59,901 --> 00:41:01,602
I think there's a lot
that could be done with it.
There's a lot to it.

00:41:01,602 --> 00:41:04,505
Especially with how proud
we are of your background.

00:41:04,505 --> 00:41:06,808
I think that story
is really powerful.

00:41:06,808 --> 00:41:10,812
Um, mark,
if you go in with me...
Mm-hmm.

00:41:10,812 --> 00:41:14,515
Maybe 30% of the company.

00:41:14,515 --> 00:41:16,250
I'd rather put in
a little bit more cash

00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,786
and get a little bit more
of the company than 30%

00:41:18,786 --> 00:41:20,188
because if there's
two of us,

00:41:20,188 --> 00:41:21,756
there's gotta be enough
skin in the game.

00:41:21,756 --> 00:41:24,358
And for what it's worth,
I started an organization

00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:26,194
called
the Fallen Patriot Fund.

00:41:26,194 --> 00:41:27,829
It's something I believe in,

00:41:27,829 --> 00:41:32,366
so what if we both put up 100k--
$200,000 for 40% of the company?

00:41:32,366 --> 00:41:35,970
That way, you have more cash,
you have more expertise,

00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:38,372
and we both have enough skin
in the game.

00:41:38,372 --> 00:41:40,508
I think $150,000 is where
we should stick

00:41:40,508 --> 00:41:42,910
at 30 or 35% of the company.

00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:54,422
We'll do 150k for 35%, okay?
Lori and I together.

00:41:54,422 --> 00:41:55,890
I'm on that deal, Mark.

00:41:57,191 --> 00:41:59,660
By the way, You'd be insane
not to take that.

00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,696
We don't want any more talking,
right?

00:42:01,696 --> 00:42:03,197
So what are you gonna do?

00:42:03,197 --> 00:42:05,800
Mark and Lori,
we accept your offer.

00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,901
All right.
Yeah.

00:42:06,901 --> 00:42:08,169
(Lori) Great.
Thank you.

00:42:08,169 --> 00:42:09,971
(laughs)
It's done.

00:42:09,971 --> 00:42:11,372
Great.
(Mark) Good, good.

00:42:11,372 --> 00:42:12,840
(Daymond) Ohh.

00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,508
Yay!

00:42:14,508 --> 00:42:16,677
(laughs) Thank you,
thank you. Congratulations.

00:42:16,677 --> 00:42:18,613
Thank you so much.
Congratulations.

00:42:18,613 --> 00:42:20,848
(Lori) You're awesome.

00:42:20,848 --> 00:42:23,050
(Kevin) Wow.

00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:27,200
To think that we started
our business with a $1,000 loan,

00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,270
and now we're business partners
with Mark Cuban

00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:34,333
and Lori Greiner, this--This is
a dream come true for us.
