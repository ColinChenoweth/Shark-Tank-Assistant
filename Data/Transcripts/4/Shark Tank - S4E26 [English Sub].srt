(man) the sharks are back

00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,474
Where hopeful entrepreneurs

dream of a chance

00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:12,012

00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:15,415
to start, grow, or save
  their businesses.

00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:16,950
Last year, we grossed 1.5.

00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,719
1.5?
  Million.

00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,288
How much again?
  If the sharks hear
  a great idea,

00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:24,458
they're ready to invest
  using their own money.

00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:27,194
Everything in my bones is saying
  This is a runaway hit.

00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:30,063
And they'll fight each other
  for a piece of the action.

00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:32,299
You take a big risk
  with me dropping out.
  Not really.

to invest the full amount
  they're asking for,

00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,645

which is why we created
  three day rule.

00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:55,042
Three day rule is unique from
  other mass-Market dating sites,

00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:58,912
because everyone must be invited
  or must be endorsed to get in.

00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,547

00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:07,654
Here's how it works--
  People request membership.

00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:10,824
They go through a competitive
  application process.

00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:12,993
Once people are accepted,
  they take a quiz.

00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:14,628
We determine
  what their type is.

00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:16,997
They receive matches,
  and can start communicating--

00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:19,299
even with me as the cofounder
  who is single.

00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,802
But they can start communicating
  with other singles

00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,403
and quickly go on dates.

00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:34,815
Many questions, Val.
  First of all,

00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:37,951
do I impute from your name,
  the three day rule,

00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,619
that perhaps
  after Three dates...

00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,791
I might...
  (laughs)

00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,060
What am I--what's the word
  I'm looking for?

00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,128
Love?
  Action.

00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:49,429
Yeah.
  No, no, no.

00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:50,964
(laughter)
  Guys, guys--
  When we read that,

00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,466
we don't read
  "Three day rule."

00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:53,767
We read "Three date rule,"
  you know?

00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,469
Oh, three date rule?
  No, actually...
  Oh...

00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:57,304
(laughs)
  Is that what you're
  implying?

00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:59,740
No. Let's clarify
  any ambiguity.

00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,576
So, the three day rule
  was this rule in pop culture

00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,644
that people thought, "I can't
  call somebody For three days

00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,413
because I'll seem
  too desperate."

00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:09,216
Oh...
  and what that results in
  is people waiting by the phone,

00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:11,551
not going out on dates, and not
  really meeting the real--

00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,553
but you are aware of
  the three date rule as well?

00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:15,689
We are aware
  of that rule, but...
  what is that rule?

00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:17,224
That's not what we're pushing.
  What is the three date rule,
  Kevin?

00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:18,792
Explain that rule, Kevin.
  The three date rule...

00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:21,194
(laughing)
  is an investment
  portfolio strategy.

00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:23,263
(laughs)
  Third date is when
  the bond comes through.

00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,966
You consummate the deal.
  (laughs) Oh, god.

00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:27,534
(daymond) So this is for
  busy, wealthy people, or...

00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:29,770
Well, we look for
  a number of criteria.

00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,639
Our demographic
  is the 12 million people

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,208
who are making
  over $50,000.

00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,344
They have to make
  over $50,000 to get in?

00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:38,945
No--I mean, it's definitely
  who we're marketing to.

00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,447
What we're looking for
  is people

00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,882
who are established
  in their career,

00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:43,049
who have had accomplishments,

00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,351
not only in
  their professional life,

00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:45,652
but also in
  their personal life,

00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,087
and who are
  relationship-Minded.

00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:48,889
The key differentiator
  from the other dating sites

00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,891
is that we actually have
  an application process,

00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:53,360
or a quiz, before you get
  onto the site.

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,262
You may find this hard
  to believe,

00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:57,130
but sometimes guys lie.

00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,832
I know. (laughs)
  It's horrible.

00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,767
Do you validate
  any of that information?

00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,269
We do validate
  the answers,

00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:04,471
and we have additional premium
  services that we'll offer.

00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,006
An additional
  revenue stream for us

00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:08,141
beyond the subscription fee
  that we're charging

00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,476
is actual validation.

00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,812
So members will actually
  have a verified--

00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,647
So unless I buy extra,
  I get the liars,

00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,148
is what you're saying?

00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,650
But, Robert, Robert,
  what's the criteria for women?

00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,051
You don't think women lie?

00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:21,321
I think women tend to be
  more honest in dating--

00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,823
so you're saying Somebody
  puts on fake nails,

00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,724
fake eyelashes, fake lips,
  and fake hair...
  (laughing)

00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,927
They're not lying?
  (laughs) Good point.
  Good point.

00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,029
Now, how many members
  do you have now?

00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:30,297
We have about 10,000 people

00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:32,232
that have submitted
  applications.

00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:33,700
Paid the subscription fee?

00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,901
No. We're pre-Revenue,
  so we're actually--

00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,670
Oh, I love that word--
  "Pre-Revenue."

00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,904
(laughs) We're actually
  in our data build.

00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:40,373
What it means is you
  have no sales.

00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,577
We launched
  about four weeks ago,

00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:45,045
and one of the things
  that we wanted to do

00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:46,646
was build up
  a core base of users.

00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,315
So at this point,
  we decided that we will not

00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:50,417
implement a paywall,
  as they call it

00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,052
in the dating industry,
  until day Three.
  Yeah, but that's
  hardly a test.

00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:53,653
Everybody jumps in
  without paying.

00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,222
One of the things
  that we had

00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:56,990
is we an earlier version
  of this business,

00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,726
and what we had was a successful
  offline matchmaking business.

00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:02,329
You had this business before?
  We did.

00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,598
We had events, and we also
  had activities,

00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:06,867
and we had matchmaking.
  And what happened
  to it?

00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,168
So that business
  is still existing.

00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:09,870
What's happening
  is we're actually

00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,072
scaling that business
  to this online offering.

00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:14,040
How much is a subscription?

00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,976
$100 is the base subscription.

00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:18,311
For a 1-year subscription?
  No, for one month.

00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,380
So it would be $100
  per month.
  $100 a month?

00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,915
Yes.
  But you haven't done that yet.
  You haven't proven that yet.

00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:23,683
You--
  we actually have
  in our offline model.

00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:25,852
How many members do you have
  in that original business?

00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,420
So for that,
  close to 10,000 people.

00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,922
(Barbara) and what's
  your revenue for that business?

00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:31,091
From that, it was about
  $70,000 from last year.

00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:33,360
Are you single?

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,928
I'm single, yes.

00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:37,731
If you're single,
  maybe the product doesn't work.

00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,466
No, it a-- (laughs)
  Aww!

00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:40,834
That's not True.
  I'm creating-- (laughs)
  I'm asking.

00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:42,702
Maybe she's too picky,
  daymond.
  No!

00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,137
I've been single because
  I've been working

00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,839
16 hours a day,
  and I don't have time

00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,607
to really go out
  and meet people,

00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,342
so I'm building this--
  but have you gone
  on your own Web site?

00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,077
I have. Actually, that was
  my profile you just saw,

00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,413
so I'm--
  so you haven't met
  your Mr. Wonderful yet.

00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,548
Well, I've put up a profile.
  I started communicating.

00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,417
But my business partner
  is an expert matchmaker.

00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,853
She's been matchmaking
  for, uh,

00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,688
pro--a very long time...
  (mark) Wait, wait, wait,
  wait, wait, wait.

00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:03,189
So she has that knowledge.

00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,191
So if you got 10,000 people,
  how many signed up

00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,193
for the $100 per year fee?

00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,462
We charge them $1,000
  for 3 dates.

00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,398
Whoa!
  $1,000 for 3 dates?

00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:13,934
It's actually--
  whoa! Boy, you gotta
  fall in love right away.

00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,268
Or you gotta cash
  that check right away.

00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,536
We did. But, uh...

00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,605
(Robert) So, Val, how long
  did you do that model?

00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,140
We did that model
  for about a year.

00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,676
And you basically made
  70 sales?

00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:24,444
Right, but we had events
  and activities also

00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,912
where we collected
  a transaction fee

00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,747
and a ticket price
  to attend our event, so...
  complicated.

00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,582
Did you make money
  on the events as well?
  We did.

00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,084
Is that a revenue generator?

00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:33,019
The online/offline commerce
  industry is huge.

00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,689
It's a $3 trillion industry.
  Val, I just don't
  understand one thing.

00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:38,191
Other sites that we see on Tv--
  don't they all do...

00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:39,993
(Kevin) they do.
  A similar thing?

00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:41,528
No.
  What--what is
  the difference?

00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,196
The difference is we actually
  screen people coming in

00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:45,198
to the community.
  Those sites
  don't screen people?

00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,100
They don't screen...
  okay.

00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,802
So anybody with
  an e-Mail address can log on

00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,637
to some of those
  mass-Market dating sites.

00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,238
Just pretend you worked
  for one of those companies,

00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,741
and we said, "One of your
  competitors, three day rule,

00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:56,910
said you don't screen at all,"
  what would they say?

00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,611
They probably would agree.
  Those--

00:07:58,611 --> 00:07:59,813
No.
  Those companies
  are about volume.

00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,581
No, I don't think so.

00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,683
Val, all I care about
  is money, okay?

00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,452
So--and you're gonna have
  to explain to me...
  yes.

00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:07,253
How you make money
  at some point today.
  Absolutely.

00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,222
So I'll take you down
  the path to revenue.

00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:12,225
Members will pay
  $100 per month.

00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,860
They're able to buy
  subscriptions

00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,695
in one-Month, 3-Month,
  and 6-Month increments.

00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,197
We estimate
  people will stay on

00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:18,698
Probably between
  three and six months.

00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:22,035
We will make anywhere between
  $300 and $600 per customer.

00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:24,504
So, if you have
  200,000 members,

00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,906
and you go across
  20 Major metropolitan cities,

00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,441
by year 3, you have
  a $20 million business.

00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:29,642
But you have
  no anecdotal evidence

00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:30,910
that that's going to be
  your metric.

00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,179
You know, Val,
  you have the perfect answers,

00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,115
but they're all based
  on theory.

00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:38,118
Um, I'm looking for
  a reason to say yes.

00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:41,621
Because if there is
  a way to differentiate

00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,456
and it's real,
  you got a home run.

00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,125
I agree,
  and I think we do.

00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,494
But you haven't proven that.

00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:49,295
One last chance.
  Okay.

00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:50,964
And don't tell me
  you have a questionnaire...
  okay.

00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:52,432
And you have algorithms.

00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:55,702
Tell me, what is it?

00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,571
♪♪

00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,478

And don't tell me
  you have a questionnaire

and you have algorithms.
  Tell me, what is it?

00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:14,487
Our major selling point,
  our value proposition

00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,289
is that everyone
  must be endorsed,

00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,992
so there is social context
  around every member.

00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:21,194
You know that
  that person has gone through

00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:23,096
an application process.
  They've been approved.

00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:25,165
There's an implicit trust
  that whoever you're meeting

00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:27,133
is someone who's been vetted,
  so people don't feel like

00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,302
they're putting themselves
  out there on a dating site

00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,337
Where everyone can see
  their love life.

00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,907
I just don't think
  that's strong enough.

00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,241
I think that every matchmaker,

00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,843
they would tell you
  the exact same thing.

00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:39,846
That's just not enough
  of a differentiation,

00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:41,514
so for that reason,
  I'm out.

00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:46,319
I don't think three day rule's
  ever going to dominate

00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,121
the dating business online.

00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:50,590
That's already done.

00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,826

  established scale There

00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:55,395

  a teenage pimple if they want.

(laughs)
  They can do all kinds
  of things to you

00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,666
that are gonna hurt
  if you start to Garner share.

00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,534
And maybe they'll buy you,
  maybe they'll crush you.

00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,637
I don't know. But for me,
  that's too big a risk.

00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:08,274
So for that reason, I'm out.

00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,377
Okay. Thank you.

00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:14,781
You're asking $200,000
  for 10%.

00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,383
You do understand you're
  valuing this at $2 million?

00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,319
Yes.
  You're not in love
  with the valuation?

00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:21,054
No, I don't think so.

00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:22,722
I'll tell you a little bit
  about the valuation.

00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,290
We already have investors
  already committed

00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,227
and money in the bank
  at a $4 million valuation.

00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,928
And that's--
  how much have you
  raised there?

00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:30,830
We've raised
  a $150,000 stake.
  At a $4 million valuation?

00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,365
Yes, that's right,
  but we realize

00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,000
the value that you bring
  to the table.

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,401
So, Val, you know the saying

00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,370
"Never trust a skinny chef,"
  right?

00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,641
Well, never invest
  in a single matchmaker.

00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,077
I'm out.

00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:48,414
(Robert) So, Val... (sighs)

00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:50,150
It's been
  an interesting journey.
  Okay.

00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,684
You're very pleasant.

I feel like we're on
  a date right now. (laughs)

00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:55,421
Oh.

00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,891
I'm not clear,
  and I keep coming back to,

00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:00,927
you're just another dating site.
  No, we're different.

00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:02,529
We are different from
  the mass-Market dating sites.

00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:03,863
But I don't think
  you explained that.

00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,431
I was looking for you to say,

00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,200
"Here's all
  the other dating sites,

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,801
but here's why I'm different."

00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:11,538
And for me,
  you didn't do that today.

00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:12,772
For that reason, I'm out.

00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,576
You were not convincing here
  at all.

00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:19,412
In fact, I would say
  you were confusing,

00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,114

00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:24,083
And most importantly,
  the name is terrible.

00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,852
Three day rule--
  I'm a girl,

00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,086
and I even interpreted it

00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,321
the way these guys
  interpreted it.

00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:31,424
Third day, you better put out.
  I like that.

00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:33,493

00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,756
And this is Barkley,
  my best friend

00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,425
who inspired me
  to start my company,

00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:46,859
Ryan's barkery.

00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,461
We are asking
  for an investment

00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:52,899
of $25,000 in exchange
  for 25% of Ryan's business.

00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:56,469
Ryan's barkery bakes and sells
  fresh, all-Natural dog treats--

00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:58,571
So fresh,
  they should be slapped!

00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:01,174
(laughter)
  If your family is like mine,

00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,842
then you consider your pet
  to be part of the family

00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,043
just like Barkley.

00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,645
After we adopted him,

00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:07,213
we went shopping
  for dog treats

00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:09,048
and found
  that they smelled horrible.

00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:11,651
They couldn't possibly
  taste fresh and be wholesome.

00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:14,020
Since Ryan and I share
  a passion for baking,

00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,388
we consulted
  with a veterinarian

00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:17,523
to find out which ingredients
  are good for dogs,

00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,692
then started experimenting
  in the kitchen.

00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,562
We didn't stop experimenting
  until we found the flavors

00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:24,697
that Barkley
  cannot get enough of.

00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,367
We made super flavors
  like pumpkin apple,

00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,902
banana oat,
  and low-Fat cheddar.

00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:32,171
Our treats are baked fresh
  with simple ingredients

00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,040
and no preservatives.

00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,808
I rode my bike
  to my friends' houses

00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,543
and did taste tests
  with their dogs.

00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,079
(laughing)
  Their dogs went crazy
  for our treats.

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,782
Look how Barkley reacts.
  (gasps and whispers) a treat.

00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,285
Look at that.
  (Robert laughs)

00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:48,788
I started getting calls
  from PET Owners

00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:50,790
asking where they could
  buy these treats,

00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,759
and that's how
  the barkery was born.

00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,627
With an investment
  from you,

00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:57,163
we could develop our Web site
  and start fulfilling orders

00:14:57,163 --> 00:14:58,631
in a commercial kitchen.

00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:01,100
We need your partnership
  in order to grow,

00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,770
because I can't do this alone...
  (Barbara laughs)

00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,439
And keep up with my homework.
  (laughter)

00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:08,741
Thank you for your time.
  We brought some treats

00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,344
for you to see, smell,
  and even taste if you'd like.

00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:13,579
(gasps)

00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,081
They're human-Grade?
  They are.

00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:17,617
Thank you, Ryan.

00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:19,552
(Barbara) Wow, great job.
  (Kevin) Thank you, Ryan.

00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,220
They're so cute!

00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,355
Thank you.
  (Robert) Barbara.

00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:23,556
Thanks, Ryan.

00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:25,124
I've never eaten
  a dog biscuit.

00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:28,060
Mmm.
  Now, Ryan, where you
  making these today?

00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,163
In our kitchen at home.

00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:32,064
When do you do it, after you
  finish your homework at night?

00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,366
On weekends?
  No.

00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,968
Early before school,
  like at 5:00.

00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:38,271
5:00 in the morning
  you get up to bake these?
  Yeah. Mm-hmm.

00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,139
Good for you, Ryan.
  (Barbara) Wow.

00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,874
You have any siblings
  that help you out?

00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,376
Uh, yeah,
  my older brother Nick.

00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:45,912
And is he getting up
  at 5:00 with you?

00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:47,213
Um, no, be--

00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:49,282
sometimes when I--
  like lacrosse practice,

00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,451
and there's an adoption event,
  I'll let him go,

00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:54,821
and then he can keep
  some of the money that he makes.

00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:56,088
Your older brother's
  working for you?

00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,257
Yeah.
  That's awesome.

00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,559
Have you sold any of these?

00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,661
We've sold
  about 200 bags of them.

00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:03,796
What do you sell--What do you
  sell the bags for, Ryan?

00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,232
$4 a bag,
  with 8 treats in each.

00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:08,367
And what does it cost you
  to make one of those bags?

00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,136
36 cents each bag.

00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,638
Ryan, have you made any
  attempts to grow the business,

00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,740
to grow--To sell more bags?

00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,210
Um, we've tried to sell
  at the supermarket...
  uh-huh.

00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,546
But... I don't think
  it worked out so well.

00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:23,115
What happened?
  They were very receptive
  to having them.

00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:25,184
We quickly found out
  that it was better to take out

00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:28,287
any middle man, to get
  the product directly to the dog.

00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,323
Ryan, are you selling them
  any other way?

00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,325
Are you selling them
  through the community?

00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,060
Like, we'll bring them
  to lacrosse Practice

00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,362
and s--Um, give out
  little samples,

00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,431
because there's a lot
  of dogs there.

00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:40,399
And a lot of people
  bought them there

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,934
and just kept on repeating.

00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,403
But did they ever buy them
  again without you there?

00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,205
Yeah.
  Yes.

00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:49,175
At the lacrosse game?
  Because the labels have
  our phone number on it, so...

00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,577
Ryan, how much money did you
  put into the business,

00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:53,079
and Where'd you get
  the money from?

00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:56,015
(laughs)
  From my best investor,

00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,383
of course--my mom.
  (Barbara) How much?

00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,652
What did mom invest?
  How much do you
  owe me, Ryan?

00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:01,988
$200.
  (laughs)

00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:04,190
Yeah, have you guys
  made a profit?
  Yeah.

00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,158
Why haven't you
  paid your mom back?

00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,426
Because we just
  keep on baking them,

00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:08,895
and at some
  of the adoption events,

00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:12,632
I give her a lot of the money
  to help pay her back.

00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:14,967
(laughs)
  Hey, Ryan, where do you
  see the business going?

00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:18,938
I see, like, stores, um,
  with my treats in them,

00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:21,307
and the Web site...
  Mm-hmm.

00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:22,875
Where people could, um,
  develop orders,

00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,644
and then we fulfill them.

00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:26,812
Ryan, you know what
  Mr. Cuban's gonna say to you?

00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:27,914
If you're a real businessman,

00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:29,849
you have to quit school
  right now...

00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:31,317
(laughter)
  And do this full-Time.

00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:32,985
No, you know what I would
  tell you, Ryan?

00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:34,420
I'm gonna tell you exactly.
  My first business

00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,155
I started when I was
  12 years old.

00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,391
And the reason I started
  my business was because

00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,526
I wanted a new pair
  of basketball shoes.

00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:43,763
And I went door to door
  to door selling garbage bags.

00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:46,165
My garbage bag route
  is not all that much different

00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,767
than what you're doing
  with your treats.

00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:50,803
But $25,000 is a lot
  of money,

00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:54,707
and with all that money
  comes a lot of responsibility,

00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:57,243
and I think it would be
  very, very difficult

00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,978
for you, while you're
  still in school

00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:01,047
and while you're trying
  to balance all these things,

00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:02,515
really to put that money
  to work, so...

00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:05,751
a-as much as I'm--
  I'm excited for you,

00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:09,155
I'm proud of you, um, I think
  you're gonna do amazing things,

00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:12,024
but I still have to say
  I'm out.

00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,326
Okay.

00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:15,895
Thank you.
  Thank you.

00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:18,264
Ryan, when I was 11 years old,

00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,967
I couldn't even dream
  of owning my own business.
  (Ryan chuckles)

00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:22,868
the reason I started my business
  is somebody

00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:25,271
much later on in life fired me.

00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,873
But to be 11 years old
  and actually go out there

00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:32,078
and dream about that--
  That's fantastic.

00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:34,013
Look, this is not the business

00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:36,248
that I want to invest
  with you in today,

00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:38,417
but I think you'll be back.

00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,753
And for that business,

00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:43,422
hopefully I'll be here,
  and we can talk then.

00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:46,025
But for this today, I'm out.

00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:47,593
Thank you.

00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,996
Ryan, so where I grew up,
  it was, uh...

00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,632
people all wanted to be rappers
  and Gangsters and...

00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:55,167
when I told my buddies

00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:58,204
that I was going to be
  a fashion designer,

00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:01,107
they laughed at me.
  But I didn't care.

00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:02,775
How do your friends
  feel about this?

00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:05,378
I think they're jealous
  now that I'm here.

00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:06,746
(laughter)
  They are.

00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:08,014
Yeah, Ryan!
  (Robert) No kidding.

00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:09,315
Way to take it to 'em.

00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:10,783
Ryan, very few 11-year-Olds
  get on "Shark tank."

00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:12,418
You're a very lucky guy.
  Mm-hmm.

00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:14,720
Here you are. It's not
  a business yet. It's a Hobby.

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,821
Nothing wrong with that.

00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,857
A Hobby you make money at
  is a good thing.

00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:19,925
But if you really want
  to turn this into a business,

00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,827
you got a long road ahead.
  Yeah.

00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,763
Good luck to you. I'm out.

00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:25,031
Thank you.

00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:29,335
I'd love to make you
  a full price offer

00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:33,539
for exactly what you're asking--
  $25,000 for 25%,

00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,341
because I think this has
  the potential to be

00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,043
a very big business quickly.

00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:39,145
(Robert) Wow!
  (daymond) Ryan,
  I want you to--

00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:41,347
And I think Barbara's making
  you a very generous offer,

00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,815
but I--
  but what?

00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,884
I want you to really think
  about what cuban said, though.

00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:50,289
You're gonna have to sell almost
  $150,000 worth of cookies

00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,758
to pay her back.
  Guess what.

00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:55,728
You don't have to pay me back
  until your 13th birthday.
  Bar--Barbara, all I want to--

00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:57,263
and all you have to do
  is pay me back

00:19:57,263 --> 00:19:59,031
$5,000 a year.

00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:02,001
By your 13th birthday,
  that's gonna be nothing.

00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:04,470
Ryan, do you really want Barbara
  at your 13th birthday party?
  (laughs)

00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,639
(Barbara) I'm not coming
  to your party.
  I think Barbara's being
  very generous.

00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:09,241
I just want you to understand...
  the responsibilities.

00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,477
The responsibility.
  I think she is a great partner,

00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:15,715
but sometimes money just creates
  a bigger problem.

00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:18,651
I think you're gonna be
  really good without us.

00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:20,853
So I'm out.

00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:22,855
Ry-Ryan, don't listen.
  Don't listen to them.

00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:24,457
(Kevin) Listen, don't listen
  to any of this.
  (mark) No, all I'm saying--

00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:26,025
Buy a leather jacket,
  take the money, buy a car.

00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:28,928
(Robert) Ryan, you--
  (laughter)

00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:31,097
Gotta say yes or no, guys.

00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:33,265
You want it? Yes or no?
  Is there anything
  to think about?

00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:35,501
(laughter)
  We have a deal.

00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:36,769
Aah!
  Yeah, there you go!

00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:38,604
All right.
  Ya-Ha!

00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:40,439
I wish I could adopt you!
  Car and college!
  Car and College!

00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:42,108
Look at this little guy.
  Let me lift him up.

00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:44,844
(Robert speaks indistinctly)
  Whoa! Good job!

00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:46,746
Nice job.
  Thank you.

00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,781
Nice job.
  Never heard a better pitch.

00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:50,116
Congratulations, Ryan.

00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:51,250
What a cutie.
  (Robert) way to go, Ryan.

00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,852
Yeah!

00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:55,020
I am so proud of you.

00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,789
Why didn't you guys bid on that?

00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:58,824
Barbara has
  a great track record...

00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:00,259
okay.
  With foodie-Type

00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,795
Yes.
  A compliment.
  At last, a compliment.

00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:04,797
I have a business. This is
  gonna be something amazing.

00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:08,200

00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,855
Tom + Chee is a grilled cheese

for the kid at heart.

00:21:31,157 --> 00:21:32,858

00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,761
I think people Love
  grilled Cheese

00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:37,496
'cause it is
  a classic comfort food.

00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,799
It's something that everybody
  had growing up.

00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,133
Sandwiches with Melted cheese
  on it--

00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,635
it doesn't really get
  much better than that.

00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:48,007
What sets Tom + Chee apart
  would be our creativity,

00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:51,443
the use of many different
  ingredients, combinations.

00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:52,545
We're always offering
  something

00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:54,246
that's fun and unique.

00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:55,614
One more basket
  for a donut, please.

00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:58,250
I got a bananarama
  coming over.

00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,985
Tom + Chee is

Corey and I

00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:04,390
we all emptied

00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:07,560
we all quit our jobs
  to start our cheesy empire.

00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,228
Our restaurants have been
  very busy.

00:22:09,228 --> 00:22:11,430
So busy, in fact,
  that sometimes it feels

00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,365
we can't keep up
  with demand.

00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,934
We're ready to go in

00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:17,903
We need this investment

Good afternoon, sharks.
  My name is Corey ward.

And I'm trew Quackenbush.
  Our company is Tom + Chee.

00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:45,097
We're seeking $600,000

00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:47,800
in exchange
  for 10% of our company.

00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,135
(sharks laugh)

00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:51,437
$600,000 may seem
  like a lot

00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:53,639
for an empire built
  on cheesy goodness,

00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:56,375
but I assure you, once you
  taste what trew's cooking...
  (sizzling)

00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,210
You'll be a believer.

00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,246
Corey and his wife came over
  for a cookout at my house,

00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:01,780
and he said, "do you want
  to open up a grilled cheese

00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,717
and tomato soup Shop?"
  Thankfully,
  trew said Yes,

00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:07,186
so in the winter of 2009,
  we emptied our bank accounts,

00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:08,554
we bought a tent
  and a griddle,

00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,155
and set up on
  Cincinnati's Fountain square

00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:11,724
next to an ice skating rink.

00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,859
The response was incredible.

00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,662
What started out as curiosity
  quickly turned to excitement,

00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:18,497
as word of mouth spread.

00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:20,566
And 364 days
  after we set up our tent,

00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,801
we opened our first shop,
  and it wasn't long before

00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,536
we had lines out the door.

00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:26,472
Then we got an offer
  from a local mall.

00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:27,873
They liked our concept so much,

00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:29,875
they basically handed us
  our second restaurant.

00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,845
This year, Tom + Chee sold
  our very first franchise,

00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:34,380
in louisville, kentucky.

00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,249
With your help, we want to
  expand our franchising efforts

00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,817
and really build
  something special.

00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:41,353
We now have over 70 employees,
  and we're growing.

00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:43,555
We are proof the American dream
  is still alive,

00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:46,592
and we know that with your help,
  we will be the next big thing.

00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,494
I've created our world-Famous
  grilled cheese donut

00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:50,963
for you to try,
  and whoever makes this deal

00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:53,098
not only is getting
  a good opportunity,

00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,868
but we're gonna name
  a sandwich after you.

00:23:55,868 --> 00:23:58,137
Let's feed some to Barbara
  and see if she lives.

00:23:58,137 --> 00:23:59,905
(laughter)

00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:03,909
This is a donut?

00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:05,644
It is a glazed--
  Yeast-Glazed donut.

00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:08,681
Yeah.
  (Robert) So I'm eating
  a donut that's been Fried?

00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:10,983
It's not been Fried,
  it's been grilled.
  Grilled.

00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:13,252
Mmm!

00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:15,154
Oh!

00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,493
I got to admit,
  it tastes great.

00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:24,530
Is this your only product?

00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,998
I mean, you mentioned
  some of these here,

00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:27,499
and I'm guessing there's
  tomato soup?

00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:28,667
Correct.
  Yes.

00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,002
And you sell traditional
  Grilled cheeses as well?

00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:31,303
We have over 20 sandwiches
  on the menu.

00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,805
Can we see your menus?
  Of course.

00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,707
Okay, so give us
  the breakdown,

00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:37,042
because as interesting
  as it sounds

00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:39,178
to talk about
  a grilled cheese and donut,

00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:42,281
that doesn't mean that's
  what everybody is buying.

00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:44,316
Well, our most popular sandwich
  is the barbecue Bacon,

00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,985
where we take
  barbecue potato chips,

00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:48,354
Bacon, American cheese,
  and we put it on white bread.

00:24:48,354 --> 00:24:49,822
Does that come
  with a defibrillator?

00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,256
(laughs)

00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:54,193
It comes with a lot of "Yum"S,
  is what it comes with.

00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:56,962
Um, we do pesto and turkey,
  we roast our own meats,

00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:58,864
create our own
  sauces and spreads.

00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:01,033
Everything we do
  is pretty much vegetarian,

00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:03,736
as far as soup Goes,
  unless we put meat in the title.

00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:05,904
So we definitely are--are
  pushing a health-Conscious--

00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:07,473
(laughing)
  "Health-Conscious"!

00:25:07,473 --> 00:25:09,408
health? Health-Conscious?

00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:11,243
It's grilled cheese.
  (laughs)

00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:14,246
So, the sandwiches are
  relatively cheap.

00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:16,181
The menus
  are definitely cheap.

00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:19,785
So are you guys perceived
  in your marketplace as being

00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:21,987
a really inexpensive place
  to go get lunch?

00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:24,456
I'm gonna re-Articulate
  his question.

00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:27,593
The menu looks like crap.

00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:30,462
The logos are crap,
  the whole thing's crap.

00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:32,097
Is crap the brand?

00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:34,967
It's gourmet grilled cheese
  that--

00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:36,668
That's given out
  at a reasonable price.

00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:38,504
In this economy,
  everybody needs something

00:25:38,504 --> 00:25:40,172
that they can take
  a family of five out to,

00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:41,740
and we can do that
  at Tom + Chee.

00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,575
You can come in
  And you can sit down with--

00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:44,910
With all your little kids,

00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,245
and everybody can have
  a great meal

00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:47,513
and walk away happy.

00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:51,417
You have 70 employees.
  What are your sales?

00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:54,753
Our--Our two corporate stores,
  um, have grossed--

00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:57,056
last year, we grossed 1.5.

00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:58,557
1.5?

00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,559
Million.

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,129
How much again?
  You sold $1.5 million
  of this stuff?

00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,365
In the last 12 months.
  Very impressive.

00:26:06,365 --> 00:26:09,234
We've actually done
  $1,400 in an hour.

00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,870
They will wait
  an hour and a half

00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,105
just to get up to order.

00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:14,339
If I drove by your shop,

00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:16,041
I'd see people lined up
  out the door?

00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,142
Yes.
  Out the door.

00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,512
Tell me what
  the franchise fees are.

00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:23,849
Okay, So, uh, to get in,
  it's, um, $35,000.

00:26:23,849 --> 00:26:26,785
And then, like, 7.5%
  comes back to us.

00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:29,521
And our franchisee,
  he had to spend about

00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:32,024
$250,000 to get
  his first store open.

00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:33,826
How's his monthly sales doing?

00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:35,427
Great.
  He did $100,000 last month.

00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,628
Wow.

00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:42,501
You know what I love
  about your business?

00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:44,436
You have
  the most important ingredient--

00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,072
the magic
  of any great business--

00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:49,274
You've got a line out front.
  Yeah.

00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,709
And I'm going to give you
  an offer.

00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:52,744
I'm gonna give you...

00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:54,880
half of the $600,000

00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,949
for 30% of the business

00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:59,118
if you can get another shark
  in on the deal.

00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:04,123
I'm sitting here
  and I'm thinking to myself,

00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,492
what's the odds that these
  two guys are gonna win?

00:27:06,492 --> 00:27:09,795
And everything in my bones
  is saying This is a runaway hit.

00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:11,530
This is a Winner.

00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,632
I want to let you guys
  get a little more focused here.

00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,767
Okay.
  My portfolio kinda goes
  the opposite way.

00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:18,170
I-I really believe
  in healthy products,

00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:21,473
so this just wouldn't be
  for me. I'm out.

00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,941
Okay.
  Okay.

00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:24,543
You know, I'm sitting
  on the fence here,

00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:26,211
looking at this saying,
  these guys have come up

00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:27,913
with something so outrageous
  that it worked.

00:27:27,913 --> 00:27:29,781
I would have never thought
  this would have Worked, ever.

00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:31,950
And it has. All right,
  I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,685
I'm gonna throw 100 grand in

00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:37,356
just to be a piece
  of this really crazy idea.

00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,393
All right, I'm in on that.
  How much you in, Robert?

00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:43,629
You have $100,000 or $200,000
  available.
  I'm in for $100,000.

00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,299
Barbara, Robert, and Kevin

00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:50,869
have made an offer, but trew
  and Corey need another $100,000

00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:53,472
from the last remaining shark
  to reach the $600,000

00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,908
they have asked for.

00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,777
What are you thinking,
  mark?

00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:01,180
You know you have
  the resources to help us grow.

00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,748
We've done our research.

00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:07,586
I'm not gonna do $100,000.

00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:15,194
It's just not worth
  the time and aggravation.

00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,995
But...

00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:18,931
what I will do is
  I'll go in with Barbara.

00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:21,633
I'll match
  Barbara's $300,000.

00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:25,137
So each of us will put in
  $300k for a total of $600k,

00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:27,739
for a total of 30% equity,

00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:30,475
but I don't want
  all the sharks in.

00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:31,743
That's just too much work,
  too much Hassle,

00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:33,712
too much paperwork.

00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,047
And in addition,

00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,382
I want the rights
  to the state of texas,

00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,484
just in case it takes off.

00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:42,721
We actually have a--
  a very interested person

00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,022
for Dallas already.

00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:45,958
Well, then
  we'll carve out Dallas,

00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:47,459
and if they don't close,

00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:49,027
then that'll revert
  back to me.

00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:52,464
And may I say
  I want new York?

00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,499
Because I'm gonna be jealous
  of him carving that out.

00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:55,634
(laughs)

00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:03,075
I'm--I'm sorry, guys.
  I'm not in love with it enough

00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,210
to compete and start
  to bid this thing up.

00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,678
I just can't get there.
  I'm out.

00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:12,551
I'll clear the field.
  You got Barbara, you got mark.

00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:16,455
$300,000 each for 30%.
  What do you say?

00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:24,162
I'd say we take the Deal.
  Yeah.

00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:26,131
Yes, sir!
  Thank you, mark.
  This is gonna be awesome.

00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:27,733
You gu--You were the two
  that we were talking about

00:29:27,733 --> 00:29:29,801
the whole time.
  It's not easy being
  cheesy, right?

00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:31,903
You know it.
  (laughter)

00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:33,772
Good for you. Good for you.
  Thank you, guys, so much.

00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,308
You gotta shave a little,
  you know?
  (laughs)

00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:37,976
Would have never seen that
  coming.

00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:39,311
Not in a million years.

00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:40,812
Awesome.
  (laughs)

00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,314
I've already got
  all the people in place.

00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:45,017
I've got a buyer. I-I can
  take it to wisconsin cheese.

00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:47,719
Good. You do all the work,
  I'll collect the profit.

00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:48,887
It's a deal?
  No.

00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:50,055
(laughs)

00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:51,657
That's not a bad deal
  for $600,000.

00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:54,026

in your back pocket.

00:30:52,348 --> 00:30:53,882
Here's how it works.
  With verbalizeit,

00:30:53,882 --> 00:30:56,986
you simply register
  at the verbalizeit Web site,

00:30:56,986 --> 00:30:58,954
or download the app.

00:30:58,954 --> 00:31:01,991
Within 15 seconds, you press
  a button on your phone.

00:31:01,991 --> 00:31:05,027
You're instantly connected
  to one of our live translators

00:31:05,027 --> 00:31:06,562
around the world.

00:31:06,562 --> 00:31:08,564
You tell that translator
  what you need,

00:31:08,564 --> 00:31:10,499
place the phone on speaker.

00:31:10,499 --> 00:31:12,801
Our translators communicate
  on your behalf.

00:31:12,801 --> 00:31:15,270
Every year, millions
  of international travelers

00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:17,673
run into situations where
  they cannot communicate

00:31:17,673 --> 00:31:19,842
because of
  the language Barrier.

00:31:19,842 --> 00:31:21,877
We want to work with you
  to put verbalizeit

00:31:21,877 --> 00:31:26,548
in the hands of individuals
  and businesses around the world.

00:31:26,548 --> 00:31:29,551
So who's ready to make a deal?

00:31:29,551 --> 00:31:31,253
Thank you, Erica.

00:31:31,253 --> 00:31:33,155
What's your background?
  Where did you come from?

00:31:33,155 --> 00:31:34,857
Uh, kunal and I met
  in business school.

00:31:34,857 --> 00:31:36,892
What business school
  did you meet in?
  At Wharton.

00:31:36,892 --> 00:31:38,961
Wow.
  (daymond) hmm.

00:31:38,961 --> 00:31:40,562
Ryan, walk me through
  how it works.

00:31:40,562 --> 00:31:41,764
I download the app.

00:31:41,764 --> 00:31:43,966
Do I call
  international 1-800 numbers?

00:31:43,966 --> 00:31:45,434
Yes.
  Correct.

00:31:45,434 --> 00:31:48,337
Your call is Routed directly
  from our virtual call center

00:31:48,337 --> 00:31:50,205
to one of our thousands
  of translators

00:31:50,205 --> 00:31:51,540
around the world.

00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,375
So you're sourcing people
  that have capacity

00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:54,877
at that moment,
  anywhere in the world--

00:31:54,877 --> 00:31:57,713
if I'm in egypt, if I'm
  in russia, I'm in cyprus,

00:31:57,713 --> 00:32:00,749
I need greek--You have
  enough people now sourced

00:32:00,749 --> 00:32:02,284
to actually translate for me?

00:32:02,284 --> 00:32:04,019
That's what's really
  interesting, Mr. Wonderful.

00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:06,488
(sharks laugh)
  We have created
  this global community

00:32:06,488 --> 00:32:08,157
of multilingual individuals

00:32:08,157 --> 00:32:10,359
who are monetizing on
  their spare time during the day.

00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:11,593
This is very interesting,

00:32:11,593 --> 00:32:13,228
but I'm trying to figure out
  the business model,

00:32:13,228 --> 00:32:16,765
because the key to this is,
  every single time I call,

00:32:16,765 --> 00:32:18,233
the guy's gotta be there
  translating for me

00:32:18,233 --> 00:32:19,668
30 seconds later.
  Absolutely.

00:32:19,668 --> 00:32:21,870
We have 2,000 translators
  already around the world,

00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:24,039
and we're live
  in Five languages,

00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:25,541
and we can connect your call
  within 15 seconds

00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:27,042
of you dialing
  into the system.
  I'm trying to figure out

00:32:27,042 --> 00:32:28,977
how you can get
  somebody that quickly

00:32:28,977 --> 00:32:32,047
in a language,
  24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

00:32:32,047 --> 00:32:34,383
It's a great question, sir.
  What we've created here

00:32:34,383 --> 00:32:36,952
is a powerful community
  of people around the world

00:32:36,952 --> 00:32:38,654
who speak a second language

00:32:38,654 --> 00:32:41,523
and want to be able to make
  money during their spare time.

00:32:41,523 --> 00:32:44,660
So by virtue of having such
  a large population of people

00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,095
who want to make money,

00:32:46,095 --> 00:32:47,996
your call will automatically
  always be answered.

00:32:47,996 --> 00:32:49,531
So, Ryan, how do you pay them?
  So, first of all,

00:32:49,531 --> 00:32:51,233
let's go to the traveler.
  Kevin's traveling.

00:32:51,233 --> 00:32:53,068
Does he pay you
  to download the app?

00:32:53,068 --> 00:32:54,937
The app is free, so anyone
  who goes to the App store

00:32:54,937 --> 00:32:57,406
can download it for free
  and try it for free,

00:32:57,406 --> 00:32:59,274
one free call.
  And then afterwards,

00:32:59,274 --> 00:33:03,145
our customers pay anywhere
  from 50 cents to $1 per minute,

00:33:03,145 --> 00:33:04,980
depending on how many minutes
  they buy.

00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,150
And then how do you pay
  the translators?

00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:11,320
Translators make anywhere
  between $7 and $15 an hour

00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,322
based on every minute
  that they translate.

00:33:13,322 --> 00:33:14,823
What percentage
  of the 50 cents

00:33:14,823 --> 00:33:16,492
you're collecting a minute
  is that?

00:33:16,492 --> 00:33:19,528
Uh, we have a 70% margin.

00:33:19,528 --> 00:33:21,230
And what are your sales
  to date?

00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,899
In the last 2 weeks,
  we have had $10,000 in sales.

00:33:23,899 --> 00:33:25,300
How long has it been
  on the market?

00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,302
Verbalizeit has been live
  as of one month.

00:33:27,302 --> 00:33:28,737
How do you filter
  these people?

00:33:28,737 --> 00:33:31,073
How do you get these, uh,
  translators, and how do you

00:33:31,073 --> 00:33:33,642
trust that they're gonna
  translate Correctly?

00:33:33,642 --> 00:33:35,978
Uh, the first and foremost,
  we found 50 TRANSLATORS

00:33:35,978 --> 00:33:38,580
by going out and talking
  to language learning centers,

00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:41,049
and we said, "Okay, would you
  like to join our community?"

00:33:41,049 --> 00:33:43,519
and then we got tremendous
  word-of-Mouth referrals.

00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,287
Do you have a ratings system
  after the Call is over...
  yes, we do.

00:33:45,287 --> 00:33:47,156
To rate the translators?
  We do. So you build up
  a reputation

00:33:47,156 --> 00:33:49,858
as a higher-Quality translator,
  you make more money.

00:33:49,858 --> 00:33:51,860
Wow.
  Our top translator made

00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,797
$550
  in the last 2 days.

00:33:54,797 --> 00:33:57,299
There are so many
  translation apps out there.

00:33:57,299 --> 00:34:00,102
Why is this specifically
  different from everything else?

00:34:00,102 --> 00:34:02,738
Well, on the one hand, you have
  machine-Based technology,

00:34:02,738 --> 00:34:04,373
which just doesn't work.

00:34:04,373 --> 00:34:06,475
And I'm gonna disagree
  with you there significantly.

00:34:06,475 --> 00:34:08,343
Machine language translation
  does work,

00:34:08,343 --> 00:34:10,846
particularly
  in a business environment.

00:34:10,846 --> 00:34:12,714
So you have to go out
  and find translators

00:34:12,714 --> 00:34:14,316
that understand business.

00:34:14,316 --> 00:34:17,386
Because if we are doing a deal,
  and someone said

00:34:17,386 --> 00:34:18,954
they've got
  a subordinated note

00:34:18,954 --> 00:34:21,590
that has a buyout at 13%,
  and we're gonna do

00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:23,258
a Cram--
  whatever it may be,

00:34:23,258 --> 00:34:25,794
typical Translator's
  not gonna understand that.

00:34:25,794 --> 00:34:27,596
Our community ranges
  from people

00:34:27,596 --> 00:34:29,198
who have just graduated
  high school

00:34:29,198 --> 00:34:31,300
to people who have their phds
  and their business degrees.

00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,402
But you lose
  your instantaneous aspect of it

00:34:33,402 --> 00:34:35,037
because that person
  has got to be available.

00:34:35,037 --> 00:34:36,972
'cause it's not like
  there's an unlimited number

00:34:36,972 --> 00:34:38,774
of those people
  willing to work cheap.

00:34:40,275 --> 00:34:41,810
What does your business
  look like

00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:43,078
in terms of the languages?

00:34:43,078 --> 00:34:44,646
So we are live
  in Five languages, as I said.

00:34:44,646 --> 00:34:47,249
Which five?
  Hindi, mandarin,
  spanish,

00:34:47,249 --> 00:34:48,784
portuguese, and French.

00:34:48,784 --> 00:34:51,186
Why not croatian?
  (sharks laugh)

00:34:51,186 --> 00:34:52,855
We don't have a translator yet.
  How about joining us?

00:34:52,855 --> 00:34:55,157
I got some time.
  We've only been live
  for a month,

00:34:55,157 --> 00:34:57,559
and we're very excited with
  some of the large partnerships

00:34:57,559 --> 00:34:58,760
that we're working on.

00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,530
We just launched a pilot
  with Skype,

00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:05,400
which means that any one
  of the 31 million Skype users

00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:09,404
can add a verbalizeit translator
  into any conversation.

00:35:09,404 --> 00:35:11,139
You've made that deal
  with skype?
  We have. We--

00:35:11,139 --> 00:35:13,542
wow. Hang--Whoa.

00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:15,277
Tell us how that deal works.
  Wow.

00:35:15,277 --> 00:35:17,579
So we reached out to skype,
  given the--

00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:19,381
the fact that
  they're a fantastic company.

00:35:19,381 --> 00:35:22,651
We are now the featured app
  in the skype app directory.

00:35:22,651 --> 00:35:24,353
Is it an exclusive deal?

00:35:24,353 --> 00:35:26,088
Can someone else
  in your space come in

00:35:26,088 --> 00:35:28,357
and also offer
  the same thing to skype?

00:35:28,357 --> 00:35:30,092
Well, since we don't have
  an exclusivity agreement,

00:35:30,092 --> 00:35:32,527
someone could technically
  come in.

00:35:32,527 --> 00:35:33,896
I see.

00:35:33,896 --> 00:35:35,297
There aren't a lot
  of companies out there

00:35:35,297 --> 00:35:36,832
doing what we're doing,
  and we do have

00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:39,001
a word-of-Mouth agreement that
  that won't be the case.

00:35:40,636 --> 00:35:42,237
I happen to think
  that skype piece

00:35:42,237 --> 00:35:44,239
is the sex appeal
  in the whole deal.

00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:46,508
Creates a lot of confidence.

00:35:46,508 --> 00:35:48,243
I really thought that was
  a real deal,

00:35:48,243 --> 00:35:51,513
like you cornered
  the skype space.

00:35:51,513 --> 00:35:54,483
So I'm out. 'cause... too shaky
  for me. I'm too scared.

00:35:55,951 --> 00:35:59,021
So, guys, my other fellow sharks
  are asking a lot of questions,

00:35:59,021 --> 00:36:03,292
because there's clearly gonna be
  some blood in the water.

00:36:03,292 --> 00:36:06,561
This is really
  in their tech space.

00:36:08,563 --> 00:36:09,831
But I'm gonna watch them fight,

00:36:09,831 --> 00:36:11,333
and this is really
  gonna be good.

00:36:13,235 --> 00:36:14,436
I'm out.

00:36:14,436 --> 00:36:15,971
Thank you.
  Thank you.

00:36:19,141 --> 00:36:21,944
See, Ryan, mark loves
  to hear himself talk so much

00:36:21,944 --> 00:36:23,645
that when he's quiet,

00:36:23,645 --> 00:36:25,881

00:36:25,881 --> 00:36:28,550
Guys, I'm--I'm gonna make
  this easy for you.

00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,719
I've made several investments
  in language.

00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:33,956
One of the challenges is,
  no solution has everything.

00:36:33,956 --> 00:36:36,625
Human translators
  sometimes don't fit

00:36:36,625 --> 00:36:38,126
for very verticalized
  applications,

00:36:38,126 --> 00:36:39,528

Machine language--
  vice versa.

00:36:43,465 --> 00:36:45,834
