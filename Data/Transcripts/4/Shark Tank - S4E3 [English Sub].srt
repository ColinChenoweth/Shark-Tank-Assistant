<i>If the sharks</i>

<i>they are ready to invest,</i>

00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:27,027
<i>And they'll fight each other</i>

gluten-free, dairy-free,
egg-free.

a blend of rice flour

and some starches,
but don't let that fool you.

(Liz) okay.

00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,904
The one with the chocolate
is cowboy.

00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,031
Then you've got
gluten-free chocolate fudge

00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,701
and gluten-free
Ginger molasses.
(mark) It's really good.

00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:48,038
Oh, I like the cowboy.
Is there nuts in it?
(Liz) Walnuts.

00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,457
You see, that's the difference
between the cowgirl cookie

00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,042
and the cowboy cookie,
is that the cowboy has nuts.

(Daymond) ooh!

00:05:02,637 --> 00:05:04,889

00:05:11,271 --> 00:05:12,564
Well,
you're in the minority

00:05:12,647 --> 00:05:13,481
thinking that
they don't taste good,

00:05:13,565 --> 00:05:16,026
'cause lots of our customers
are not gluten-free.

00:05:16,109 --> 00:05:17,819
Let me tell you this.
So, one in three

00:05:17,902 --> 00:05:20,530
U.S. Households
is now catering to someone

00:05:20,613 --> 00:05:22,907
in their house
who has to eat gluten-free

00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:23,491
for one reason or another.

00:05:23,575 --> 00:05:26,036
So this is
the best of the cookies

00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:26,494
you wouldn't eat
unless you had to?

00:05:26,578 --> 00:05:29,581
The very best.
(Robert chuckles) No.

00:05:29,664 --> 00:05:32,042
You don't know this,
but I'm a gluten-free mogul.

00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,960
No, I do know that, mark.
Oh, you do know? Okay.

00:05:34,044 --> 00:05:35,337
So what got me interested

00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,630
is because of
athletic performance.

00:05:36,713 --> 00:05:38,506
Steve Nash and other athletes
now eat gluten-free,

00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,675
so it's become
more mainstream.

00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,260
But it's a very competitive
market,

00:05:42,344 --> 00:05:44,638
as Kevin alluded to.

00:05:44,721 --> 00:05:48,391
How much money do you make
on $1 million in sales today?

00:05:48,475 --> 00:05:49,476
It's about 10%.

00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:51,478
But we're nowhere
near scale

00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:54,314
in terms of what
our profitability could be

00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:56,983
in terms of cost and maximizing
our value on overhead.

00:05:57,067 --> 00:05:58,485
How do you blow this up
so that you become

00:05:58,568 --> 00:06:01,863
the brand for... sand
or whatever it is?

00:06:01,946 --> 00:06:04,157
Okay, so that is
the opportunity

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,159
we have right now.

00:06:06,242 --> 00:06:07,827
What's amazing about
our cookies is that

00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:08,495
they're not the boxed,

00:06:08,578 --> 00:06:11,748
sit on the shelf
next to 16 other brands.

00:06:11,831 --> 00:06:13,249
This is a perishable cookie

00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,668
that sits
in the bakery department.

00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:16,419
How long is its shelf life
in that bag?

00:06:16,503 --> 00:06:18,046
30 days
outside of the freezer.

00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:18,463
What does it cost you to make?

00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:22,842
About a dollar to make
one pack of two cookies.

00:06:22,926 --> 00:06:26,054
So, two cookies are costing
what at retail?

00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:28,056
$3.99 to $4.99.

00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:30,725
(Daymond) That's a lot.
That's an expensive cookie.

00:06:30,809 --> 00:06:31,476
You know, this is where
the price

00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:33,812
of this category lives.

00:06:33,895 --> 00:06:36,064
If you go and you get
a single gourmet

00:06:36,147 --> 00:06:38,650
allergen-friendly cookie,
it's gonna cost you 2 bucks.

00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:40,485
Do you have
a retail location in Vermont?

00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:44,239
No. Actually,
the one retail location

00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:45,907
that we tried
to put together

00:06:45,991 --> 00:06:48,618
was destroyed three days
before opening

00:06:48,702 --> 00:06:50,328
by hurricane Irene
in a flood.

00:06:50,412 --> 00:06:53,498
We lost $15,000
and a whole summer's worth

00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:56,167
of long nights
building things.

00:06:56,251 --> 00:06:57,794
Did you think you were going
to survive through that

00:06:57,877 --> 00:06:58,461
when that happened?

00:06:58,545 --> 00:07:01,381
I mean, we are the most
relentless businesspeople

00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:03,174
you're ever gonna meet.

00:07:03,258 --> 00:07:05,719
That was the smallest setback
that we've survived.
Yeah.

00:07:05,802 --> 00:07:08,013
Yeah, we've had--
We've had a lot of knocks.

00:07:08,096 --> 00:07:10,557
When the recession hit,
it really hit our business.

00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,310
We couldn't pay our loans.
We called the bank and said,

00:07:13,393 --> 00:07:14,686
"we don't think
we can pay next month."

00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:17,147
So what did the bank say?
"When are you gonna pay us?

00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,481
We're gonna auction
all your stuff off."

00:07:18,565 --> 00:07:19,858
And Dan and I decided

00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:21,276
the only way
we're out of business

00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:23,111
is if someone comes
and literally takes the seat

00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:24,863
from under our butt.
You know, we were
out of money,

00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:25,488
we were out of time,

00:07:25,572 --> 00:07:27,907
but we just fought
and fought and fought.

00:07:27,991 --> 00:07:29,492
We got really creative.
We built an e-commerce site,

00:07:29,576 --> 00:07:32,412
and we just
sold, sold, sold,

00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:33,955

we've worked our way up

00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:35,957

How are you distributed,

00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,502
and what percentage
of your sales are wholesale?

00:07:39,586 --> 00:07:42,422
So, 90% of the sales
are wholesale, at least.

00:07:42,505 --> 00:07:44,799
We are distributed
by the--the country's

00:07:44,883 --> 00:07:46,885
largest natural foods
distributor.

00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:49,471
We were just at the I.D.D.B.A.
trade show in New Orleans.

00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:52,807
Essentially, every single person
that walked up to the booth

00:07:52,891 --> 00:07:55,143
said, "We're looking for this.
This is great.

00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:57,187

thing we've tasted yet."

00:15:50,794 --> 00:15:52,379
I was able to get in

00:15:52,462 --> 00:15:54,506
four of the top retailers
in America.

00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:57,718
Now, the only thing
I wasn't prepared for

00:15:57,801 --> 00:16:00,637
were the politics
of retail.

00:16:00,721 --> 00:16:04,766
So I definitely took
a few hits along the way.

00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:09,938
But every fight led me
to here today in front of you.

00:16:10,022 --> 00:16:14,443
Everyone that sees Rock Band
loves Rock Band.

00:16:14,526 --> 00:16:16,445
That even goes
for the rich and famous.

00:16:16,528 --> 00:16:18,405
You don't even have
to take <i>my </i>word.

00:16:18,488 --> 00:16:22,451
You can take it from the voice
of the rich and famous.

00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:26,830
That's right, sharks.
(laughter)

00:16:26,913 --> 00:16:30,459
Rock Bands by Lee Dahlberg are
the hottest thing in Hollywood.
Oh!

00:16:30,542 --> 00:16:33,086
Rock Bands can be seen
on the celebrity wrists

00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,464
of Bono, Johnny Depp,

00:16:35,547 --> 00:16:37,758
Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie,

00:16:37,841 --> 00:16:41,219
Tommy Lee, Britney Spears,
Lindsay Lohan,

00:16:41,303 --> 00:16:43,764
even President
William B. Clinton,

00:16:43,847 --> 00:16:46,767
and... me, Robin Leach.

00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,435
Rock Bands--
The ultimate expression

00:16:48,518 --> 00:16:51,021
of Champagne wishes
and caviar dreams,

00:16:51,104 --> 00:16:53,357
individuality, and fashion.

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,067
Love that, Robin.
(Barbara) Wow!

00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,568
We loved it.
Good job, Robin.

00:16:56,652 --> 00:16:57,986
Very impressive.
Good luck.

00:16:59,488 --> 00:17:00,614
Lee, how did you get him?

00:17:00,697 --> 00:17:02,366
Um, we've been friends
for years.

00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:04,660
Sharks,
I've taken the liberty

00:17:04,743 --> 00:17:08,080
to create a Rock Band
for each of you...

00:17:08,163 --> 00:17:09,289
Oh, cool!
Based--

00:17:09,373 --> 00:17:10,999
Based on your
individual personalities.

00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:13,085
Awesome. Thank you, Lee.
This is for you.

00:17:13,168 --> 00:17:14,795
This is for you.
You brought out Robin Leach.
You got our attention.

00:17:14,878 --> 00:17:16,672
Ah, exactly.
What do you have
for Mr. Wonderful?

00:17:16,755 --> 00:17:19,466
Oh. You are a special one.
I hope it explodes.

00:17:19,549 --> 00:17:22,636
(laughter)
Yeah. Yes. Here you are.

00:17:22,719 --> 00:17:24,137
Ooh, I like that.
(chuckles)

00:17:24,221 --> 00:17:27,182
So--So, Lee, you said
they had healing powers.

00:17:27,265 --> 00:17:28,684
Yes, sir?
Do you have any idea

00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:30,435
the history of people
who've come into the tank

00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:32,062
talking about healing powers?
No--

00:17:32,145 --> 00:17:33,772
No, I'm not the great wazoo.

00:17:33,855 --> 00:17:35,607
You're not selling these
as medicinal

00:17:35,691 --> 00:17:37,359
in any way, are you?
No--at the end of the day,

00:17:37,442 --> 00:17:39,611
if it's a placebo,
it makes everyone smile.

00:17:39,695 --> 00:17:41,655
Tell--Tell us about
your sales.

00:17:41,738 --> 00:17:45,367
Sales. I've done about
$300,000 in sales.

00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:46,535
Over what period?

00:17:46,618 --> 00:17:47,577
Five and a half years.

00:17:47,661 --> 00:17:49,871
(Mark and Daymond) OHH!
No--Ohh! Here you go.

00:17:49,955 --> 00:17:51,957
What are sales gonna be
this year, Lee?

00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,835
It all depends.
The one thing about the brand

00:17:54,918 --> 00:17:56,628
is that I own
the trademarks.

00:17:56,712 --> 00:17:57,963
Something came up
just recently--

00:17:58,046 --> 00:17:59,923
a very well-Known
italian company

00:18:00,007 --> 00:18:01,591
is launching in America.

00:18:01,675 --> 00:18:03,760
They called me,
and we signed a contract.

00:18:03,844 --> 00:18:06,179
They're gonna launch
under the name Rock Band.

00:18:06,263 --> 00:18:08,473
So you licensed Rock Band
to them?
Yes.

00:18:08,557 --> 00:18:10,017
It's called Rock Band by...
(speaks italian).

00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,643
And they did $1 million
last year,

00:18:11,727 --> 00:18:12,936
and they're think--
That's in Europe,

00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,605
and my share is 40%
of all U.S. sales.

00:18:15,689 --> 00:18:17,691
I'm sorry. They're gonna
give you 40% of net,

00:18:17,774 --> 00:18:19,484
correct?
All U.S. Sales.

00:18:19,568 --> 00:18:21,403
Of profit?
Gross or net?

00:18:21,486 --> 00:18:23,405
Some of the negotiation
is about helping

00:18:23,488 --> 00:18:24,781
in cost of manufacturing.
Okay. Hold on, hold on.

00:18:26,491 --> 00:18:29,703
If they sell $100,000
worth of product--

00:18:29,786 --> 00:18:33,665
Gross sales--Will they
give you $40,000,

00:18:33,749 --> 00:18:37,502
or, after everything
is paid, said, and done,

00:18:37,586 --> 00:18:41,256
will you get 40%
of the total profit?

00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,175
Meaning maybe $10,000.

00:18:43,258 --> 00:18:46,470
Uh, as it stands,
of the profit. You're right.

00:18:46,553 --> 00:18:49,681
And you mentioned something
about politics of retail?

00:18:49,765 --> 00:18:51,850
I had a large P.O. agreement.

00:18:51,933 --> 00:18:54,686
How large was
your purchase order?
Uh, 150,000.

00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,439
After it was manufactured,
well, they did in fact cancel.

00:18:57,522 --> 00:18:59,066
Isn't a purchase order
a contract, though?

00:18:59,149 --> 00:19:00,692
That's what <i>I </i>said.

00:19:00,776 --> 00:19:03,612
And I was told, kind of,
um, "Sue us."

00:19:03,695 --> 00:19:07,741
Walk me through the economics
of all this and this.

00:19:07,824 --> 00:19:09,618
$12, and it, uh...

00:19:09,701 --> 00:19:11,703
$12 for--everything in This
is $12?
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

00:19:11,787 --> 00:19:13,288
Including the case?
Yes, sir.

00:19:13,372 --> 00:19:14,414
And what do you sell it for?

00:19:14,498 --> 00:19:16,208
Um, that wholesales at $50,

00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:19,753
and then retails--
Suggested $99 to $150.
Great margin.

00:19:19,836 --> 00:19:22,130
How many units have you sold
in the last month?

00:19:22,214 --> 00:19:25,509
A dozen a week. And I know
that's not impressive. I--

00:19:25,592 --> 00:19:28,095
actually, it's not so horrible
at 150 bucks a pop.

00:19:28,178 --> 00:19:31,473
I give you $100,000 today--
What are you gonna do with that?

00:19:31,556 --> 00:19:35,018
30% will probably go to,
like, Web site optimization.

00:19:35,102 --> 00:19:38,772
30% has to go to a-a lawyer
to protect the trademarks

00:19:38,855 --> 00:19:40,315
that are already being
infringed of mine.

00:19:40,399 --> 00:19:41,733
So what you're saying is,
you've had to fight

00:19:41,817 --> 00:19:44,611
the game company that did
"Rock Band" the game, right?

00:19:44,695 --> 00:19:46,655
Well, obviously, they have
the rights to do electronics...
right.

00:19:46,738 --> 00:19:48,907
'cause that's not my field,
but what I have is clothing.

00:19:48,991 --> 00:19:51,410
Oh, so you want to sue <i>them</i>
for making--for the clothing?

00:19:51,493 --> 00:19:53,578
Yeah--I wouldn't say "Sue."
I would just say,

00:19:53,662 --> 00:19:55,539
"Hello. Remember me?"
yes, of course.

00:19:55,622 --> 00:19:57,416
We don't want to say
anything harsh.

00:19:57,499 --> 00:19:59,543
(Kevin)
I want to make you an offer.

00:19:59,626 --> 00:20:03,588
How about I give you $100,000,
and I buy Rock Band from you?

00:20:03,672 --> 00:20:05,465
All of it. The whole thing.
(chuckles)

00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:07,134
And I pay you
for the rest of your life

00:20:07,217 --> 00:20:11,263
a 7% royalty on everything
I commercialize with that brand.

00:20:11,346 --> 00:20:13,265
And by the way, I have
a whole bunch of lawyers

00:20:13,348 --> 00:20:15,600
to take care of all
the problems of people

00:20:15,684 --> 00:20:17,519
that have messed around
with our brand.

00:20:17,602 --> 00:20:19,521
I'm sure your letterhead would
scare them a lot more than mine.

00:20:19,604 --> 00:20:22,524
(chuckles)
No, I-I help encourage them
to do the right thing.

00:20:22,607 --> 00:20:23,942
No, of course.
At the end of the day,

00:20:24,026 --> 00:20:25,485
I could make a lot of money
with this.

00:20:25,569 --> 00:20:27,237
I'm not sure the rocks sell,

00:20:27,321 --> 00:20:28,655
so I don't really care
about that.

00:20:28,739 --> 00:20:31,074
But I care about the brand.
Of course.

00:20:31,158 --> 00:20:33,535
I could license this brand
in a lot of places.

00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,205
Lee, I think you're unlucky.

00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:39,833
This went wrong,
that went wrong,

00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:42,502
and luck tends not to change
around businesses.
(laughs)

00:20:42,586 --> 00:20:44,296
Are you kidding me?
(Barbara) I hope I'm wrong.

00:20:44,379 --> 00:20:45,464
That is--
(Robert) You know what?
That is such crap.

00:20:45,547 --> 00:20:47,299
Come on. You make
your own luck in life.

00:20:47,382 --> 00:20:49,051
Don't tell the guy
he's unlucky and he's doomed.

00:20:49,134 --> 00:20:51,345
I don't think you're unlucky.
You just got a shark

00:20:51,428 --> 00:20:53,305
to offer you $100,000 cash.

00:20:55,015 --> 00:20:56,516
I'm gonna join Kevin
on half his offer.

00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,435
(laughs) "I don't want
to work you.

00:20:58,518 --> 00:21:00,687
No, no, no.
There's everything wrong,
but I'm gonna go in, because..."

00:21:00,771 --> 00:21:03,273
I was about to call her a witch,
but I'm taking that back now.

00:21:03,357 --> 00:21:05,442
Oh, no.
Because I'm going to partner
with Barbara on this.

00:21:05,525 --> 00:21:08,487
You get two sharks.
You get a shark and a sharkette.

00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:11,490
50/50.

00:21:11,573 --> 00:21:13,200
What are you gonna do?

00:21:13,283 --> 00:21:14,701
Listen to the whispers
real quick.

00:21:14,785 --> 00:21:16,578
(laughs) Smart man.

00:21:16,662 --> 00:21:18,914
(Daymond)
Here's what I'm thinking.

00:21:18,997 --> 00:21:20,999
I'm interested
in the business.

00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:24,294
Mark and I, uh, invested in some
girls named Litter last year...

00:21:24,378 --> 00:21:26,296
I was very aware of that.
And they are doing incredible.

00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,174
If... mark agrees,

00:21:29,257 --> 00:21:32,469
I'll give you the first $50,000
if he gives another $50,000,

00:21:32,552 --> 00:21:34,262
and we would want 40%.

00:21:34,346 --> 00:21:36,264
I don't like it.
Of course you don't like it,

00:21:36,348 --> 00:21:37,683
because it's far better than--
'cause it doesn't
make sense.

00:21:37,766 --> 00:21:39,768
It makes total sense.
The opportunity here

00:21:39,851 --> 00:21:41,687
is to leverage
the two together.

00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,271
All right, so, Lee--
Listen, Lee, you've got
to make a decision.

00:21:43,355 --> 00:21:45,524
You have a real offer here,
all right?

00:21:45,607 --> 00:21:47,442
Sure. We just don't want
to be--
got a lot of noise--
You've got a team here

00:21:47,526 --> 00:21:49,569
that's been licensing masters.

00:21:49,653 --> 00:21:52,072
Barb's proved herself on
television a zillion times now.

00:21:52,155 --> 00:21:54,574
(Kevin) she's gonna put this
on television.
Oh, this is a shoo-In for qvc.

00:21:54,658 --> 00:21:56,535
(mark) Lee, let me--Let me
quantify this for you.

00:21:56,618 --> 00:21:58,078
Your challenge is...
back offers.

00:21:58,161 --> 00:22:00,872
Fulfillment and back offers.
We've already done this,

00:22:00,956 --> 00:22:03,500
so you'll be able to step
right in and just go to work.

00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:06,128
And I think that's why we'll be
able to do a great deal.
(Barbara) But, Lee, think about
one other thing.

00:22:06,211 --> 00:22:07,421
You're an artist at heart.

00:22:07,504 --> 00:22:09,673
If you were to just
unload this business

00:22:09,756 --> 00:22:12,634
and collect your check,
you're free as a bird

00:22:12,718 --> 00:22:14,845
to develop your next dream,
the dream after that.
You're gonna have Kevin

00:22:14,928 --> 00:22:16,638
and a real estate agent
designing jewelry after that.

00:22:16,722 --> 00:22:18,682
Why would you wanna stay with
both feet in the business?

00:22:18,765 --> 00:22:21,518
It's all attractive
in its own ways.

00:22:21,601 --> 00:22:24,104
I-I see the benefits
of both, honestly.

00:22:24,187 --> 00:22:26,523
That alone is proof
that you ought to be

00:22:26,606 --> 00:22:27,733
walking out of this business.

00:22:27,816 --> 00:22:29,818
Anybody's who's married
to a business

00:22:29,901 --> 00:22:32,612
never sees the benefit
of walking away.
He's just being objective

00:22:32,696 --> 00:22:34,656
and just analyzing
what's in front of him.
No. His heart's not in it.

00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,992
Wow. Really?

00:22:37,075 --> 00:22:38,618
Lee, I'm gonna make
one last statement,

00:22:38,702 --> 00:22:41,663
and then I-I may actually
recant the offer.

00:22:41,747 --> 00:22:45,625
I think that we can
license as well,

00:22:45,709 --> 00:22:47,461
if the opportunity
provides itself,

00:22:47,544 --> 00:22:50,714
but we will also let you work on
your dream instead of saying,

00:22:50,797 --> 00:22:52,716
"You've been doing this
for three to five years. Leave."

00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,676
Can we make sure
that the licensing

00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,763
is an actual part of it--
absolutely. We're gonna--
Everything.

00:22:57,846 --> 00:23:00,515
It's your company still.
You own 60% of the company.

00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:03,268
So I'm gonna let you
answer us yes or no right now.

00:23:03,352 --> 00:23:04,853
And you'll be inspired...
(Kevin) Lee, you have
to make a decision.

00:23:04,936 --> 00:23:06,688
To seek out these
licensing deals?
You have to decide.

00:23:06,772 --> 00:23:09,232
Basically, as long as you're
in--in the same interest

00:23:09,316 --> 00:23:10,942
of licensing--
Yes, we will license it.
Absolutely.

00:23:11,026 --> 00:23:12,527
Absolutely?
Absolutely.

00:23:16,573 --> 00:23:18,492
Yes or no?

00:23:24,331 --> 00:23:25,457
Yes.

00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,875
Good job.
Done deal.

00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:28,543
Huge opportunity missed.

00:23:28,627 --> 00:23:30,045
Good job, Lee.
Looking forward to it.
Absolutely.

00:23:30,128 --> 00:23:31,505
All right, thank you.
Appreciate it.

00:23:31,588 --> 00:23:33,924
All right.
Just because
we didn't make a deal

00:23:34,007 --> 00:23:35,717
doesn't mean
you can't root for me.

00:23:35,801 --> 00:23:37,344
Come on.
Put your hand in there.
(laughing)

00:23:37,427 --> 00:23:39,262
Put your hand in there.

00:23:39,346 --> 00:23:42,099
Thank you.
Good job, Lee.
Looking forward to it.

00:23:42,182 --> 00:23:44,101
(Kevin) Huge mistake.

00:23:44,184 --> 00:23:46,186
(Lee exhales)

00:23:46,269 --> 00:23:49,690
He's unlucky? Well, his luck
just changed, Barbara.

00:23:49,773 --> 00:23:51,566
(Daymond)
His luck just changed.
His luck just changed.

00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:53,485
Daymond, I'm not happy.

00:24:06,289 --> 00:24:10,043
<i>who invented an eco-friendly</i>
<i>must-have for babies.</i>

00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,552
Hi. My name is Tereson Dupuy,

00:24:18,635 --> 00:24:22,973
and I am founder and C.E.O.
Of Fuzzibunz Diapers.

00:24:23,056 --> 00:24:25,892
I am here asking
for a $500,000 investment

00:24:25,976 --> 00:24:30,188
for a 15% equity stake
in my company.

00:24:30,272 --> 00:24:34,568
This trash represents
the 1 ton of garbage

00:24:34,651 --> 00:24:37,154
that one baby generates
in disposable diapers

00:24:37,237 --> 00:24:39,072
by the time
they're potty-trained.

00:24:39,156 --> 00:24:42,617
Disposable diapers make up
the third largest consumer item

00:24:42,701 --> 00:24:44,077
in landfills today.

00:24:44,161 --> 00:24:49,166
One disposable diaper takes
up to 400 years to decompose.

00:24:49,249 --> 00:24:52,127
But, sharks,
I do have a solution.

00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:56,882
Fuzzibunz are a 100%
reusable diapering product

00:24:56,965 --> 00:25:00,844
that is easy to use
and easy to wash at home.

00:25:00,927 --> 00:25:04,556
They save parents over $2,500
on their diapering cost,

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,643
because you only need
12 Fuzzibunz

00:25:07,726 --> 00:25:10,729
in comparison
to 8,000 disposables.

00:25:10,812 --> 00:25:12,439
They also keep
babies drier,

00:25:12,522 --> 00:25:14,399
uh, more comfortable,
rash-free,

00:25:14,483 --> 00:25:18,403
which is why I created them
for my own Baby 12 years ago.

00:25:18,487 --> 00:25:20,989
So Fuzzibunz
are a pocket-style diaper.

00:25:21,073 --> 00:25:22,908
There's a pocket in the back

00:25:22,991 --> 00:25:25,827
that you insert
a microfiber pad into.

00:25:25,911 --> 00:25:28,163
The lining is polar fleece,

00:25:28,246 --> 00:25:30,457
so even though
the pad inside is wet,

00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,459
the lining is staying dry,

00:25:32,542 --> 00:25:34,961
so the baby's more comfortable,
and less diaper rash.

00:25:35,045 --> 00:25:36,380
The outside is waterproof,

00:25:36,463 --> 00:25:38,298
so everything stays
where it belongs.

00:25:38,382 --> 00:25:40,050
Now let's talk
about the washing,

00:25:40,133 --> 00:25:41,301
because I know
everybody wants to know

00:25:41,385 --> 00:25:43,387
what do you do
with the poop?

00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,805
(laughter)
So it's easy.

00:25:44,888 --> 00:25:46,139
If it's solid poop,

00:25:46,223 --> 00:25:48,266
it just plops right on
into the toilet,

00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,018
where it belongs,
by the way.

00:25:50,102 --> 00:25:52,187
It's never solid.
(laughter)

00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,230
I'm getting there.

00:25:53,313 --> 00:25:55,732
If it's less than
the ploppable variety,

00:25:55,816 --> 00:25:57,401
we have a handy-dandy
diaper sprayer

00:25:57,484 --> 00:25:58,902
that attaches
to a toilet,

00:25:58,986 --> 00:26:01,989
parents can just rinse off
whatever's left over,

00:26:02,072 --> 00:26:04,992
they put it in this mess-free
hanging diaper pail,

00:26:05,075 --> 00:26:06,493
and then when they're
ready to wash,

00:26:06,576 --> 00:26:09,287
you unzip the diapers
into your washing machine,

00:26:09,371 --> 00:26:13,375
including the bag,
and your hands stay clean.

00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:14,710
Thank you.

00:26:14,793 --> 00:26:16,837
Feeling these really
makes you believe in them.

00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,256
The color of money
for you.
Thank you.

00:26:19,339 --> 00:26:21,091
Kevin, how's it compare
to the one you're wearing?

00:26:21,174 --> 00:26:23,635
(laughter)

00:26:23,719 --> 00:26:26,805
So who's ready
to invest in Fuzzibunz?

00:26:26,888 --> 00:26:29,975
Stop generating
tons of trash,

00:26:30,058 --> 00:26:32,811
and start generating
tons of cash.

00:26:32,894 --> 00:26:34,688
How long you been
doing it, Tereson?

00:26:34,771 --> 00:26:36,064
12 years.

00:26:36,148 --> 00:26:37,065
12--Wow.
Whoa.

00:26:37,149 --> 00:26:38,191
12 years.
Wow.

00:26:38,275 --> 00:26:39,985
What are
your sales last year?

00:26:40,068 --> 00:26:41,987
Last year,
they were $3.9 million.

00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,405
Whoa.
(Barbara) Wow.

00:26:43,488 --> 00:26:46,575
But I've sold
$24 million worth

00:26:46,658 --> 00:26:49,661
with no advertising,
word-of-mouth only.

00:26:49,745 --> 00:26:51,038
Where are they sold?

00:26:51,121 --> 00:26:53,165
Internet sites.
No retail?

00:26:53,248 --> 00:26:55,375
No big-box retail,
but we have boutiques.

00:26:55,459 --> 00:26:58,211
How much profit did you make
on $3.9 million?

00:26:58,295 --> 00:27:00,422
$20,000.
Oh!

00:27:02,299 --> 00:27:05,302
Why is it so low?

00:27:05,385 --> 00:27:07,346
Because I had
manufacturing problems.

00:27:07,429 --> 00:27:09,931
We went overseas,
into China,

00:27:10,015 --> 00:27:11,183
thought it was gonna
be a good thing,

00:27:11,266 --> 00:27:13,185
until they took
all of my product,

00:27:13,268 --> 00:27:15,062
patterns, et cetera,

00:27:15,145 --> 00:27:16,313
handed it over
to somebody else,

00:27:16,396 --> 00:27:18,023
so now she's
competing with me.

00:27:18,106 --> 00:27:19,816
I can't even tell
the two products apart.

00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,735
Kevin, are you paying attention
to what she just said?

00:27:21,818 --> 00:27:23,987
Hey. That's why
you have a patent, my friend.

00:27:24,071 --> 00:27:26,323
I have a patent,
but it wasn't very strong.

00:27:26,406 --> 00:27:27,908
When I first started out,
I had no money,

00:27:27,991 --> 00:27:29,242
couldn't afford
a good patent attorney.

00:27:29,326 --> 00:27:32,037
And your factory
just gave this to her?

00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,748
Yes. She was in Hong Kong.
She was my distributor.

00:27:34,831 --> 00:27:36,166
Wow. The story
gets even worse.

00:27:36,249 --> 00:27:37,668
I mean, you're in--
You're in the poo-poo business,

00:27:37,751 --> 00:27:39,961
and poo-poo happens.
Yes, it does.

00:27:40,045 --> 00:27:41,088
Did you Sue?

00:27:41,171 --> 00:27:42,214
We are suing.

00:27:42,297 --> 00:27:43,715
Wow. You know, in my business,

00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:46,093
people always tell me you can
sue anybody for anything,

00:27:46,176 --> 00:27:47,427
but good luck collecting.

00:27:47,511 --> 00:27:48,720
(Daymond) Correct.
Right.

00:27:48,804 --> 00:27:50,097
What do you think'll happen
to your sales

00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,640
if by magical force,

00:27:51,723 --> 00:27:53,850
your patent's successful
and you shut her down?

00:27:53,934 --> 00:27:55,727
What incremental sales
would you get

00:27:55,811 --> 00:27:57,771
as a result of it?
70% more.

00:27:57,854 --> 00:27:59,022
Whoa.
Wow.

00:27:59,106 --> 00:28:02,150
And you think your sales
would go up 70%?

00:28:02,234 --> 00:28:03,151
Oh, yes.

00:28:03,235 --> 00:28:04,152
Not just from her,

00:28:04,236 --> 00:28:06,571
from <i>all </i>of the people
that are squatting.

00:28:06,655 --> 00:28:08,073
Well, tell us more.
Whoa, sorry.
Seriously?

00:28:08,156 --> 00:28:10,075
Who else--Who else
is squatting?
(Daymond) Who else?

00:28:10,158 --> 00:28:11,284
A lot of people.

00:28:11,368 --> 00:28:12,869
If you combine 'em all
and roll 'em up,

00:28:12,953 --> 00:28:14,454
how much do you think
annual sales are?

00:28:14,538 --> 00:28:16,665
I would say, if I had
to give a good average,

00:28:16,748 --> 00:28:20,085
probably selling
between $30 and $40 million.

00:28:20,168 --> 00:28:21,586
Total?
Whoa!

00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:23,088
Okay. Hold on here.

00:28:23,171 --> 00:28:24,715
They're all
breaching your patent?

00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:26,049
Yes.

00:28:26,133 --> 00:28:28,010
Now This is where
poo-poo really happens.

00:28:28,093 --> 00:28:29,553
Mm.
Because frankly,

00:28:29,636 --> 00:28:31,346
this is
a very hard business.

00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:34,266
You've gotta get retail,
you've gotta get distribution,

00:28:34,349 --> 00:28:36,852
you have inventory issues,
manufacturing issues.

00:28:36,935 --> 00:28:40,314
Or you work with
my army of lawyers,

00:28:40,397 --> 00:28:42,232
who sues everybody
into the stone age

00:28:42,316 --> 00:28:43,817
until they agree
to a license deal.

00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,153
That is the slimiest,
the nastiest,

00:28:46,236 --> 00:28:49,364
the worst element
of business.
Welcome to
the real world, mark.

00:28:49,448 --> 00:28:50,907
No! Look, if you're not
part of the solution,

00:28:50,991 --> 00:28:52,659
you're part of the problem.
I am the solution!

00:28:52,743 --> 00:28:55,287
That is absolutely
part of the problem.
This is why we have patents!

00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:56,580
This is why we have law
in this country.
No, no, no, no.

00:28:56,663 --> 00:28:58,373
You know what you do?
You out-compete.

00:28:58,457 --> 00:28:59,958
Why have you not been able
to just kick their butt

00:29:00,042 --> 00:29:01,543
because you're
a better company,

00:29:01,626 --> 00:29:03,170
you're a better solution,
and you're a better execution?

00:29:03,253 --> 00:29:05,922
And that's the position
I've taken this entire time.

00:29:06,006 --> 00:29:07,883
Here's what I see--
You hit a roadblock.

00:29:07,966 --> 00:29:09,468
And how you respond

00:29:09,551 --> 00:29:11,887
is exactly what guides
your future.

00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:14,222
Mm-Hmm.
Unfortunately,
it sounds like

00:29:14,306 --> 00:29:16,308
you talked
to too many lawyers,

00:29:16,391 --> 00:29:19,144
talked to too many kevins,
and you were rudder-Less.

00:29:19,227 --> 00:29:21,188
And someone
who's coming in

00:29:21,271 --> 00:29:22,731
is probably gonna
have to come in

00:29:22,814 --> 00:29:24,191
and do more pooper-Scooping,

00:29:24,274 --> 00:29:26,234
and I don't wanna be
in the pooper scooper business,

00:29:26,318 --> 00:29:28,070
so I'm out.

00:29:31,198 --> 00:29:32,991
I'm looking at you
and thinking of myself

00:29:33,075 --> 00:29:34,993
at different crossroads
along the way,

00:29:35,077 --> 00:29:38,580
where people stole my stuff,
things got in the way.

00:29:38,664 --> 00:29:41,792
And I just had to persist,
and I see that in you.

00:29:41,875 --> 00:29:44,211
What I'm not sure I trust
in you is your judgment.

00:29:44,294 --> 00:29:46,338
Okay. Well, Barbara,
if you invest in me,

00:29:46,421 --> 00:29:48,006
I will do whatever
you tell me to do.

00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:50,550
But I have
no interest at all

00:29:50,634 --> 00:29:52,135
in being the entrepreneur
for your business.

00:29:52,219 --> 00:29:53,345
I'm an investor...
Mm-hmm.

00:29:53,428 --> 00:29:54,680
An advocate,

00:29:54,763 --> 00:29:56,390
but I'm certainly not
gonna solve all your problems.

00:29:56,473 --> 00:29:57,516
I will not quit.

00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:00,310
And I see the vision
for this company.

00:30:00,394 --> 00:30:01,603
I've had a lot of challenges,

00:30:01,687 --> 00:30:03,939
from divorce to, uh,

00:30:04,022 --> 00:30:05,440
to manufacturing issues,

00:30:05,524 --> 00:30:06,650
to... you name it.

00:30:06,733 --> 00:30:09,486
It's just not
in my D.N.A. To quit.

00:30:09,569 --> 00:30:10,570
I'm sorry to say
I am out.

00:30:10,654 --> 00:30:13,740
Okay. Thanks.

00:30:13,824 --> 00:30:17,119
Daymond, I'm winking at you.

00:30:17,202 --> 00:30:19,162
You know, when you first
started talking all that poo,

00:30:19,246 --> 00:30:21,581
you attracted
a really big fly over here.
Yeah.

00:30:21,665 --> 00:30:24,960
But peeling back the layers
on this onion,

00:30:25,043 --> 00:30:27,254
it's starting to stink...
Mm-hmm.

00:30:27,337 --> 00:30:28,255
And I'm out.

00:30:28,338 --> 00:30:30,340
Okay.

00:30:32,175 --> 00:30:34,761
You seem to be looking
for a lifeline.

00:30:34,845 --> 00:30:36,346
Mm-hmm.
I like to invest
in businesses

00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:39,141
that are in upswing.

00:30:39,224 --> 00:30:42,602
I think once a-a stone
starts rolling down a hill,

00:30:42,686 --> 00:30:45,147
it's very, very difficult
to stop.

00:30:48,066 --> 00:30:49,901
I'm out.

00:30:54,156 --> 00:30:55,991
Tell me if any
of the assumptions

00:30:56,074 --> 00:30:58,035
I'm going to make now
are wrong.

00:30:58,118 --> 00:30:59,369
You're an innovator.
You practically created

00:30:59,453 --> 00:31:01,163
the cloth diaper business.
I did.

00:31:01,246 --> 00:31:03,206
Yet at the same time,
everybody else

00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:07,169
took a huge part of it,
70% of it away from you.
Mm-hmm.

00:31:07,252 --> 00:31:09,713
Some of that's your fault.
It just is.

00:31:09,796 --> 00:31:11,965
I started this industry,
I grew it,

00:31:12,049 --> 00:31:13,258
I did all of the footwork--

00:31:13,342 --> 00:31:14,509
Look, I admire
your tenacity,

00:31:14,593 --> 00:31:17,471
but I don't wanna join you
on your...

00:31:17,554 --> 00:31:18,472
on your ride.

00:31:18,555 --> 00:31:19,765
I wish you
the best of luck,

00:31:19,848 --> 00:31:22,476
but I'm out.

00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,269
Okay. Thank you.

00:31:24,353 --> 00:31:25,771
Good luck.
Thanks.

00:31:31,318 --> 00:31:33,070
I didn't get a deal
from the sharks,

00:31:33,153 --> 00:31:34,905
but I'm not upset with them.

00:31:34,988 --> 00:31:36,239
They told me the truth,

00:31:36,323 --> 00:31:38,742
and they didn't do it from
a good business perspective.

00:31:38,825 --> 00:31:40,786
But you know what stopped me
from getting a deal?

00:31:40,869 --> 00:31:42,537
All of the I.P. squatters
out there

00:31:42,621 --> 00:31:44,873
that are making tons of money
off my idea.

00:31:44,956 --> 00:31:45,874
So...

00:31:45,957 --> 00:31:47,376
Just look out.

Yeah, please. I would love that,

00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,835
Now we asked
Jonathan and Anna

00:33:07,918 --> 00:33:09,503
to join us today...

00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:12,548
to show the importance
of posture in ballroom dancing.

00:33:12,631 --> 00:33:15,301
And good posture's not only
critical for ballroom dancing,

00:33:15,384 --> 00:33:17,094
it's critical
for everyday life.

00:33:17,178 --> 00:33:19,180
Unfortunately, today,
we're hunched over our computers

00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:20,514
and our mobile devices,

00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:23,809
and poor posture has become
a worldwide epidemic.

00:33:23,893 --> 00:33:25,519
PostureNow is a simple device

00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:27,563
that can be worn inside
or outside of your clothes.

00:33:27,646 --> 00:33:29,231
In fact,
Mike's wearing one right now.

00:33:29,315 --> 00:33:33,402
As you can see,
it is two neoprene arm bands...
(laughter)

00:33:33,486 --> 00:33:35,321
We're still laughing at it,
just so you know.

00:33:35,404 --> 00:33:36,614
When your shoulders
slouch forward,

00:33:36,697 --> 00:33:38,073
it provides a gentle reminder

00:33:38,157 --> 00:33:39,325
to keep your shoulders back
and your back straight.

00:33:39,408 --> 00:33:41,869
It looks like "used by
law enforcement everywhere."

00:33:41,952 --> 00:33:43,162
(laughter)
Yeah. No kidding, right?

00:33:43,245 --> 00:33:44,538
I-I initially came up
with the idea

00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:46,791
because I was looking for a way
to get rid of my beer belly

00:33:46,874 --> 00:33:49,043
without actually having
to stop drinking beer.

00:33:49,126 --> 00:33:50,711
And I noticed that when
I stood up straight,

00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:52,588
my belly would
magically disappear.

00:33:52,671 --> 00:33:54,882
And one of the biggest
surprises we found

00:33:54,965 --> 00:33:58,052
is how the dance community
has really embraced PostureNow.

00:33:58,135 --> 00:34:00,054
Yeah, Well,
posture and timing

00:34:00,137 --> 00:34:01,305
in dancing is everything,

00:34:01,388 --> 00:34:04,100
as Mark here might attest, yes?

00:34:04,183 --> 00:34:06,310
Couldn't attest to,
actually.
Yes. He has the experience.

00:34:06,393 --> 00:34:07,978
Have you tried it?

00:34:08,062 --> 00:34:09,647
Well, I'm actually wearing it
right now, as I'm dancing.

00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:11,023
Really?
Really?

00:34:11,107 --> 00:34:13,150
Oh, 'cause you really
needed it, right, Jonathan?

00:34:13,234 --> 00:34:14,318
(laughter)
You know what?

00:34:14,401 --> 00:34:15,903
You can always get better.

00:34:15,986 --> 00:34:17,071

00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:27,456
Uh, $39.95.

00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,041
What does it--
What does it cost to make?

00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:30,668
Costs about $5 a unit.

00:34:30,751 --> 00:34:31,961
So what's
your wholesale price?

00:34:32,044 --> 00:34:33,587
We--We do wholesale also.
Wholesale price is $19.95.

00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:34,672
How are you
selling them right now?

00:34:34,755 --> 00:34:35,881
Internet only.

00:34:35,965 --> 00:34:38,551
Every month on Google,

00:34:38,634 --> 00:34:40,177
there are over
1 million searches

00:34:40,261 --> 00:34:43,180
for "posture"
And posture-related keywords.

00:34:43,264 --> 00:34:44,557
Are--Are chiropractors
and doctors

00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,392
gonna get behind this and say,

00:34:46,475 --> 00:34:48,102
"This is good for your back"?
I can't say they're
gonna get behind it,

00:34:48,185 --> 00:34:50,020
but they've been
buying the hell out of it.

00:34:50,104 --> 00:34:51,313
And you're saying
this company

00:34:51,397 --> 00:34:53,399
is worth now
about $700,000?

00:34:53,482 --> 00:34:55,067
$650,000. Yeah.
Yeah.

00:34:55,151 --> 00:34:57,069
That's what we value at.
Okay, $50,000
between friends, right?

00:34:57,153 --> 00:35:00,322
Yeah. Yeah.
Um, it's a lot of money
you're asking for this company.

00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:03,742
I mean, you are
stacking the deck,

00:35:03,826 --> 00:35:05,327
because you have Anna
and Jonathan in here talking.

00:35:05,411 --> 00:35:07,830
Yeah. Why not?
But the only problem
is if they weren't here--

00:35:07,913 --> 00:35:09,540
But you know what, Daymond?
They <i>are </i>here.

00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,543
How much money have you guys
invested to this point?

00:35:12,626 --> 00:35:14,462
Initially, we put
about 5 grand on a credit card.

00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:16,922
Oh, $5,000 now
is worth $700,000.

00:35:17,006 --> 00:35:18,841
I like those numbers.
These guys are drug dealers!
Hey, it's a great business.

00:35:18,924 --> 00:35:21,051
Only in the shark tank can you
create that kind of wealth.

00:35:21,135 --> 00:35:23,512
(Barbara)
So you do have a patent?

00:35:23,596 --> 00:35:25,556
We do.
A utility patent.
And you only spent $5,000?

00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:27,057
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Pending.
It's--It's pending.

00:35:27,141 --> 00:35:30,227
Oh, patent <i>pending.</i>
Ohh! Pending!

00:35:30,311 --> 00:35:31,645
But also, we've gotten

00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:33,564
some really good support
from chiropractors.

00:35:33,647 --> 00:35:35,983
And another market which
we're just starting to hear from

00:35:36,066 --> 00:35:37,318
is H.R. departments

00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:39,653
of--of--Of huge
fortune 500 companies

00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:41,322
that are like,
"This is preventative."

00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:43,449
So how many corporate orders
did you get?

00:35:43,532 --> 00:35:45,075
We have no corporate orders,
just inquiries.

00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:46,076
Oh, you've <i>heard</i>
from them.

00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,286
Something we want
to target.

00:35:47,369 --> 00:35:48,913
Okay. Well, these guys
like to talk about what's wrong.

00:35:48,996 --> 00:35:50,164
Let's talk
about what's right.

00:35:50,247 --> 00:35:51,457
Let's do. Thank you.
I'd love to do that.

00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,042
Okay. Let's get into
some real details here.
Okay.

00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:55,461
You've done $330,000
in sales.

00:35:55,544 --> 00:35:58,547
You've said
your net margins are 40%.

00:35:58,631 --> 00:36:02,092
So you're making $132,000,
basically.

00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,594
So you guys--
You're splitting it

00:36:03,677 --> 00:36:04,929
and you're putting it
in your pockets?

00:36:05,012 --> 00:36:06,138
Yeah.
Pretty much, so far.

00:36:06,222 --> 00:36:07,348
I mean--
What are your real jobs?

00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:08,974
Are they anything
to do with posture?

00:36:09,058 --> 00:36:11,977
I-I'm a--I'm a sales director
for an art handling company,

00:36:12,061 --> 00:36:13,062
so we--You know...

00:36:13,145 --> 00:36:14,730
and I own
a little videography company

00:36:14,814 --> 00:36:16,649
where I do
corporate training films.

00:36:16,732 --> 00:36:20,402
Why did you not reinvest
that $132,000 into the business

00:36:20,486 --> 00:36:22,446
since you already
have other jobs?

00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:25,157
Well, to be honest, this was
kind of more of a Hobby.

00:36:25,241 --> 00:36:27,284
And so now we're starting
to realize

00:36:27,368 --> 00:36:29,078
this could be
really, really big.

00:36:29,161 --> 00:36:30,734
It's a hobby.
You're pulling out some cash.

00:36:30,818 --> 00:36:32,069
But, you know,
if I put money in,

00:36:32,152 --> 00:36:34,113
I wanna know you're gonna
do it full-time.

00:36:37,449 --> 00:36:38,534
I want to be the first guy

00:36:38,617 --> 00:36:40,744
to quit his job
on--On national television.

00:36:40,828 --> 00:36:41,829
(laughter)

00:36:41,912 --> 00:36:43,706
You have tantalized me

00:36:43,789 --> 00:36:45,749
with the idea that
there is a market for this.

00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:47,626
I think it's
sort of semi-Interesting.

00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,628
I'd give you 100k.

00:36:49,712 --> 00:36:51,880
I want 50%.
I also want--

00:36:51,964 --> 00:36:52,965
Not gonna happen.

00:36:54,049 --> 00:36:55,134

00:37:00,055 --> 00:37:01,724

Let's--okay.
I'll hear you out, Kevin.

00:37:03,726 --> 00:37:05,644
Always listen, all right?

00:37:05,728 --> 00:37:08,480
$100,000 just doesn't
fall out of the ceilings.

00:37:08,564 --> 00:37:09,648
Understood.
All right.

00:37:09,732 --> 00:37:11,442
I'll give you $100,000.
I want 50%.

00:37:11,525 --> 00:37:13,861
I want a star attached,
that comes out of your hide.

00:37:13,944 --> 00:37:15,112
All right?
Okay.

00:37:15,195 --> 00:37:18,282
And I want a 10% royalty
on Every unit sold.

00:37:18,365 --> 00:37:20,451
If you own half the business,
why would you want a royalty?

00:37:20,534 --> 00:37:21,910
I have to get
some cash flow back.

00:37:21,994 --> 00:37:22,995
How do I get my money back?
How does it come back?

00:37:23,078 --> 00:37:25,998
No. I would not
do that.

00:37:26,081 --> 00:37:28,751
Whoo!
Whoo! Let's give him
a round of applause.

00:37:28,834 --> 00:37:31,920
I just wouldn't do it.
No way.
So--So far I'm the only guy
that offered you anything.

00:37:32,004 --> 00:37:34,465
But it's just
too much equity.

00:37:34,548 --> 00:37:36,967
And I think you know that.
Well, what do you think
is a fair amount of equity?

00:37:37,051 --> 00:37:38,635
Uh, the offer I made--15%.

00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:40,304
No, that's insane.
That's what
I think's fair.

00:37:40,387 --> 00:37:42,222
This is not worth
$600,000 right now.

00:37:42,306 --> 00:37:44,433
Why not?
Because you haven't
proven it yet...

00:37:44,516 --> 00:37:45,893
we've proven it
two years!
As a business.

00:37:45,976 --> 00:37:47,561
It's sold $300,000!
You haven't proven
anything.

00:37:47,644 --> 00:37:49,938
Yeah.
You put $5,000 into it.

00:37:50,022 --> 00:37:52,524
Patent pe--
We took $5,000
and turned that into $330--

00:37:52,608 --> 00:37:54,610
$5,000, patent pending,
and it's worth $700,000 now?

00:37:54,693 --> 00:37:55,986
That's--Absolutely.
Well, then
you don't need the money.

00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,529
You shouldn't
be here then.

00:37:57,613 --> 00:38:00,449
This stage is for people
who <i>need </i>money and need deals.

00:38:00,532 --> 00:38:02,576
And every time
you get up here,

00:38:02,659 --> 00:38:04,620
you take that opportunity
away from somebody

00:38:04,703 --> 00:38:05,913
who <i>really </i>needs it,

00:38:05,996 --> 00:38:08,248
who appreciates the offer
of $100,000.

00:38:08,332 --> 00:38:10,667
You know what? I-I'm--I'm not
begging for anything.

00:38:10,751 --> 00:38:12,252
I'm offering something.

00:38:12,336 --> 00:38:14,672

You--Then write him
a check, Barbara.
Ay, ay--

00:38:56,261 --> 00:38:57,512
You gonna write him a check?

00:38:57,596 --> 00:38:59,890
Daymond, I think
I was being passionate,

00:38:59,973 --> 00:39:00,974
I think you were
being passionate.

00:39:01,058 --> 00:39:03,060
I'd like you
to reconsider.

00:39:03,143 --> 00:39:05,020
Just--Just reason it out here.
Here--Here's why
I cannot reconsider.

00:39:05,103 --> 00:39:06,063
Okay.
Honestly.

00:39:06,146 --> 00:39:07,522
Okay.
I'm gonna tell you
the truth.

00:39:07,606 --> 00:39:09,983
Okay.
I know the product.
I like it. I wore it before.

00:39:10,067 --> 00:39:11,902
Okay.

00:39:11,985 --> 00:39:13,028
You did?
Yeah.

00:39:13,111 --> 00:39:14,196
I was fascinated with it.

00:39:14,279 --> 00:39:17,324
I was staying in the back,
as I usually do.

00:39:17,407 --> 00:39:19,701
And then I ran my mouth.
Yes.

00:39:19,785 --> 00:39:21,036
(laughs) So please--

00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,454
Gut I'm gonna tell you
the honest truth--

00:39:22,537 --> 00:39:24,373
I would have had
the same exact offer

00:39:24,456 --> 00:39:25,957
without the royalty.

00:39:28,502 --> 00:39:29,586
I'm gonna stay out.

00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:30,879
Okay. Fair enough.

00:39:30,962 --> 00:39:32,673
I don't know what
he's seeing wrong in you.

00:39:32,756 --> 00:39:34,257
I mean, I've never
met an entrepreneur

00:39:34,341 --> 00:39:36,051
who wasn't
as spunky as this guy.

00:39:36,134 --> 00:39:37,719
But you got up on the wrong side
of the bed today.

00:39:37,803 --> 00:39:38,971
Well, I--
What is this, "kumbaya"?

00:39:39,054 --> 00:39:40,055
it's a business!
No, no. I'm just--

00:39:40,138 --> 00:39:42,182
I apologize for Daymond,
the way he treated you.

00:39:42,265 --> 00:39:44,267
That--I-I--
who cares?
Talk business!

00:39:44,351 --> 00:39:45,727
Barbara, you gonna give him
an offer or not?

00:39:45,811 --> 00:39:46,979
Or just keep preaching?

00:39:47,062 --> 00:39:48,480
There's a lot
I like about this.

00:39:48,563 --> 00:39:51,024
What I don't like is I think
your price is way out of line.

00:39:51,108 --> 00:39:54,528
39 bucks? I think
it should be under $20.

00:39:54,611 --> 00:39:55,862
It could absolutely
be done.

00:39:55,946 --> 00:39:59,366
But I have to say that I am not
as convinced as you are

00:39:59,449 --> 00:40:02,869
that its application is as broad
as you're suggesting.

00:40:02,953 --> 00:40:04,871
And you were a little weak
in your presentation

00:40:04,955 --> 00:40:06,748
on who's gonna buy it.

00:40:06,832 --> 00:40:09,751
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:40:10,836 --> 00:40:12,879
Wow.
Thanks.

00:40:12,963 --> 00:40:16,341
That stings. (laughs)
Yep.

00:40:16,425 --> 00:40:17,676
What you're asking for
is just nuts.

00:40:17,759 --> 00:40:20,971
Uh, I'll give you
$100,000 for 40%.

00:40:21,054 --> 00:40:21,930
No royalty.

00:40:22,014 --> 00:40:23,015
Okay.

00:40:23,098 --> 00:40:24,683
That's my offer.

00:40:24,766 --> 00:40:26,685
Mark, we haven't heard
from you yet.
Well--

00:40:26,768 --> 00:40:28,895
Whoa! What am I,
chopped liver?

00:40:28,979 --> 00:40:30,230
Exactly. I-I--
"Thanks for your offer,

00:40:30,314 --> 00:40:31,857
But, mark,
what do you think?"

00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:34,484
Matt, there's a reason
you don't talk!

00:40:34,568 --> 00:40:35,610
(laughter)

00:40:35,694 --> 00:40:37,029
Robert, thank you
for the offer,

00:40:37,112 --> 00:40:41,616
and we'd like
to consider it.

00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,868
Are there any other offers?

00:40:42,951 --> 00:40:44,286
They are working the room.

00:40:46,872 --> 00:40:48,457
You know what?

00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,625
I'm gonna pull my offer.

00:40:50,709 --> 00:40:53,962
Because it seems like you're
trying to work <i>me...</i>
(exhales)

00:40:54,046 --> 00:40:55,088
So I'm gonna work you.

00:40:55,172 --> 00:40:58,175
But you know what?
That's a good thing.

00:40:58,258 --> 00:41:00,469
Let him go.

00:41:00,552 --> 00:41:01,928
It's that simple.
Here's where I'm at--

00:41:02,012 --> 00:41:03,263
Absolutely. In fact--
Absolutely. We actually--

00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:06,767
Sometimes it pays
to listen.

00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:08,894
Isn't this wonderful?
All roads come back to me.

00:41:08,977 --> 00:41:11,313
No, actually,
the undertaker--

00:41:11,396 --> 00:41:14,024
We already know
what's happening with you.

00:41:14,107 --> 00:41:15,400
I understand
on the equity.

00:41:15,484 --> 00:41:17,527
Because there's 2 of you,
50% partners,

00:41:17,611 --> 00:41:19,946
and if you give up 40%,

00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:21,615
it just doesn't feel right.

00:41:21,698 --> 00:41:25,869
So 35% for Matt,
35% for, uh, Mike,

00:41:25,952 --> 00:41:29,706
and 30% for Mark.

00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:34,378
But because there's
an evolutionary life, um, scale

00:41:34,461 --> 00:41:37,214
for the product,
I do want a royalty.

00:41:37,297 --> 00:41:40,634
Ouch.

00:41:40,717 --> 00:41:41,635
Of $5 per unit,

00:41:41,718 --> 00:41:44,721
only until
I get my money back.

00:41:44,805 --> 00:41:46,056
Then it ends,

00:41:46,139 --> 00:41:48,850
with the expectation you--
Mike, you have to quit your job.

00:41:48,934 --> 00:41:49,977
Okay.

00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:50,852
You have to tell me now.

00:41:50,936 --> 00:41:53,146
I'm not gonna
get into a bidding war.

00:41:55,107 --> 00:41:56,024
How do you feel?

00:41:56,108 --> 00:41:57,776
I feel great.

00:41:57,859 --> 00:41:59,903
We're in!
And I quit my job!

00:41:59,987 --> 00:42:01,113
Let's do this!
I quit my job!

00:42:01,196 --> 00:42:03,949
I don't have to
go to work on tuesday!

00:42:04,032 --> 00:42:05,367
(Barbara) Sorry!
(laughs)

00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:06,952
Thanks, mark.
Appreciate it so much.

00:42:07,035 --> 00:42:08,370
Thanks, mark.
Appreciate it.

00:42:08,453 --> 00:42:10,122
You are two smart guys.

00:42:10,205 --> 00:42:11,123
(Anna) Bye!
(Jonathan) Take care.

00:42:11,206 --> 00:42:13,417
(Barbara) Bye, Mike!
(Mike laughs)

00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,585
I didn't think they were
gonna go for the royalty.

00:42:15,669 --> 00:42:16,712
I didn't think so, either.

00:42:16,795 --> 00:42:18,046
I like you on that one.
I like that.

00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:21,883
So may I have
a little celebratory dance?

00:42:21,967 --> 00:42:22,926
Yes. All right.
Yeah.

00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,261
If you don't mind,
Jonathan?
Go for it.

00:42:24,344 --> 00:42:25,887
(laughter)
You deserve it today.

00:42:25,971 --> 00:42:27,639
And, Jonathan, I'm not
gonna ask you to dance.

00:42:27,723 --> 00:42:30,017
That's all right.
(laughing) I really don't
know how to dance.
