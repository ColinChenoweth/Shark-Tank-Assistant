00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,330
(man) The sharks are back

00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,220
in an all-new season
of "Shark Tank,"

00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,170
where hopeful entrepreneurs
from across the country

00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,400
dream of a chance
to secure an investment

00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,150
and gain powerful partners

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,330
to start, grow,
or save their businesses.

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,080
We have five
pending purchase Orders

00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,330
for over a million dollars.

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,100
If the sharks
hear a great idea,

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,130
they're ready to invest
using their own money...

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,400
I'm gonna offer you
$200,000.

00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,080
And they'll fight each other
for a piece of the action.

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,220
How many brands
have you grown?

00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,380
Name the brands
that you have grown.
I just passed
a lemonade stand this morning

00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,280
that sells
more product than you.

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,430
But first, the entrepreneurs
must convince a shark

00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,470
to invest the full amount
they're asking for,

00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,270
or they'll walk away
with nothing.

00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,330
So you have access
to retailers?

00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,030
I did $6 billion.
B-B-B-Billion.

00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,070
It's sink or swim.

00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,220
I've never seen a man sweat
as much in my life.

00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,370
(laughter)

00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:54,470
Who are the sharks?

00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:00,220
They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors

00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,350
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,420
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,000
who turned a $10,000 loan
into a software business

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,280
worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,450
Lori Greiner,
the queen of QVC,

00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,270
holds over 100 patents

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,350
and has launched
over 300 products

00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,330
grossing over a half
a billion dollars

00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,150
in retail sales.

00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,230
Daymond John is a fashion mogul
and branding expert

00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,200
who grew his homemade
clothing line

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,250
into the globally recognized
fashion brand Fubu.

00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,320
Robert Herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,200
is now a technology mogul

00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,170
who sold his first
internet companies

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,470
for over $350 million.

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,380
And Mark Cuban,

00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,380
notorious billionaire
entrepreneur

00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,100
and the outspoken owner
of the Dallas Mavericks.

00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,430
First in is Aly Lessor,

00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:07,100
with a business inspired
by her daughter Cosette.

00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,020
Hi, sharks.
My name is Aly Lessor,

00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,100
and I'm the creator

00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,080
of the children's clothing line
Cozy Bug.

00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,180
I'm asking for $50,000

00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,080
in exchange for
25% of my company.

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,030
Most kids outgrow their clothes
every season,

00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,170
and it gets really expensive.

00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:38,170
However, our pillowcase dresses
grow with the kids.

00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,350
And the way
they're designed,

00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,230
they cinch here
at the neck,

00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,200
and then we use
these beautiful ribbons

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,480
that tie at the shoulder,

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,420
allowing for growth
under the arm

00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,080
and in length.

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,480
Now eventually,
the kids sprout so much,

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,120
and then you just put on

00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,070
an adorable pair
of leggings or shorts

00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,070
and you have another outfit
for years to come.

00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,070
Cosette is 4 years old,

00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,450
and she's in
a size 4.

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,120
This is Morgan,
who's 8 years old,

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,180
and she is still
in a size 4.

00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,330
I'm a Southern girl
now living in Los Angeles,

00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,380
and my mother-In-law
in Alabama

00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,150
started mailing us
the most adorable

00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,270
monogrammed pillowcase
dresses

00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,380
for my daughter Cosette.

00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,430
Cosette is Cozy Bug.
That's her nickname.

00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,250
And whenever she wore them,
we would literally get stopped

00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,220
four to five times a day
by moms saying,

00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,230
"Where did you get
that outfit?"

00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:30,050
and that's when I decided
to pillowcase the world.

00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,400
Our pillowcase dresses are not
actually made from pillowcases.

00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,370
We use really fun,
vibrant fabrics.

00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,330
We have jackets, jeggings,
shirts,

00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,250
and of course every outfit
needs a matching hair bow,

00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,080
which we've sold
thousands of.

00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,430
I have taken Cozy Bug
just about as far as I can

00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,180
with my contacts.

00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,220
With your help
and expertise,

00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,350
we can make Cozy Bug
an international brand

00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,170
and take it places
I could only imagine.

00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,400
So come on, sharks.

00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,350
Who's ready to pillowcase
the world?

00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,180
Aw!
(sharks laugh)

00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,200
Okay, thank you, girls.
Say bye to the sharks.

00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,420
Bye, sharks!
(Lori) Bye!

00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,330
(Mark) See ya!
(men) Bye!

00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,150
Aw. (laughs)

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,200
I'm in.
(laughter)

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,400
(laughs)
Is the concept
of a pillowcase dress

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,320
something that's been around
in the south forever,

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,000
as you said?
It has, yes.

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,050
(Lori) Oh, really?
Yeah.

00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,450
How many people
are in your company?

00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,450
Me.

00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,170
Just you?
Yeah.

00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,070
(Robert)
What's your background?

00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,280
I was in sales. I've been
in sales for 20 years.

00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,000
And had my daughter Cosette.

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,420
And they were not letting me
pump my breast milk at work.

00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:38,170
And I told my 26-year-old
female manager,

00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,100
"I need to pump,"
and she's like,

00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,430
"Oh, we don't have time
for that right now.

00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,250
You're gonna have to wait."

00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,080
So I told my manager,
"I'm sorry.

00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,430
I have to go do this
right now."

00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,330
And she's like, "you can get
your stuff and go home."

00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,020
Fired me--
Oh, my--

00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,150
Wow.
Really?

00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,330
Yes. And, uh...
come on.

00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,330
Yes, so I sued her, won,

00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,000
and I had money
to start my company.

00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,170
Wow, good for you.
I love that.

00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,470
I love that.
Outstanding. Great story.

00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,200
I can't believe somebody
would say that to you. That's--

00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,430
I was like,
what year are we in?

00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,330
A female, at that.

00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:09,150
What does it cost you
to make one pillowcase dress?

00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,430
$6.
$6.

00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,430
With fabric
and manufacturing.

00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,450
I know you guys could get
that done a lot cheaper.

00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,320
(chuckles)
Where are you selling?

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,250
The main place we sell
is online.

00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:23,150
In just 30 days,
we sold over $300,000...

00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,320
Whoa. Oh.
Worth of dresses.

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,030
Oh. Really?

00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,220
The Web site that I sell on--

00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,030
Have you guys heard of
zulily?

00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,370
So you're allowed
to go on there

00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,470
three days every month.

00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,100
And within 30 days
of being on there,

00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,280
$300,000.

00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,080
Ooh!

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,050
We also just launched
our own dancewear line

00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,270
called Dance Bug.

00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:45,170
We sell tutus and all that.

00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,000
(Kevin) Why,
when you know you've found

00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,230
this remarkable niche,

00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,200
would you want to bother
competing

00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,200
with everybody else
in the children's lines,

00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,120
making, you know,
ballerina dresses and coats?

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,230
Kevin's right.
So you think just this?

00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,350
You've got--You've got
the ability

00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:00,130
to differentiate yourself
from everybody,

00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,180
and it's making you
a boatload of money.

00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,450
Why not be great
at one thing?

00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,170
I don't agree with that,
because this is

00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,250
a fashion item--
'cause it doesn't work
on QVC, that's why.

00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,000
If mark knew about fashion,
he would know that women,

00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,070
when you start with something
and it's a great concept

00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,000
and people are loving it,
they want more.

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,330
And that's how businesses
continue to grow

00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,370
and grow and grow.

00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,070
So you are very smart to--
That's also how businesses
go out of business as well.

00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,270
They try to get too wide--
All of these--

00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,170
Nothing great.
Well, maybe,
But not in fashion, Mark.

00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:26,350
In fashion--
Right, because so many fashion
companies just stay in business.

00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,000
They all stay in business.
None of them ever go out

00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,220
from expanding their lines
too quickly.

00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,070
But, Mark, you're not
in the fashion business.

00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,020
Okay, Aly, here--Here's
the way I see it.

00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,420
The biggest mistake many,
many entrepreneurs make

00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,000
is that they try to do
too much too soon.

00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,050
And it kills them
and they go out of business.

00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,320
I like to shoot for the stars.
I see me going everywhere.

00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,230
I'm glad you told me that,
because to me,

00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,130
it's better to dominate
at one thing

00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,380
and then build off of that.

00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,370
By going too wide,
typically companies drown.

00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:57,380
And so, for that reason,
I'm out.

00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,350
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you.

00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,380
I'm not here
just for money.

00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,180
I'm here for a partnership.

00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,470
I have tried countless times
to even get phone numbers

00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:13,200
or contacts of the buyers
at the big box stores.

00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,150
It's impossible.
It's a secret society.

00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,050
All right, let me--

00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,320
Let me clear
the field a little bit.

00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,270
I can't really offer you
the expertise

00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,450
in terms of what you're doing
and your expansion plans.

00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:28,230
Let me get out of the way.

00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,270
I'm out.
I wish you all the best.

00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,080
And I'll make you
an offer, okay?

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,130
Because you're unique.

00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,320
I'll give you $50,000,

00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,320
and here's how much equity
I want in your business.

00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,350
Zero. Okay?

00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:51,080
You're gonna pay me
$2 a dress

00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,330
until I get my 50k back,

00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:55,350
and then you're gonna pay me
$1 forever after that.

00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,170
Here's the covenant.

00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:00,370
I forbid you to make anything
except hair bows

00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,150
and pillowcase dresses.

00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,350
Every dress does need
a hair bow. (laughs)

00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,430
(laughter)
It's true.

00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:09,270
Last season,
I took a woman

00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,350
who came in with a towel
with a slit in it.

00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:14,170
Mr. Wonderful said
It was insane.

00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,430
It was madness.

00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,050
And to date, we're
in the Disney theme parks,

00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,420
all over, with that towel
with the slit in it.

00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,330
I'm going to offer you
the $50,000...

00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:28,170
Take 30% stake in the company,

00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:31,020
and take this nationwide.

00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,480
And not just on QVC,

00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,480
but we can take it
into all the retailers,

00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,120
and I think that I can
make you a millionaire

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,330
with this line.

00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,030
Here's why that's
a bad idea.

00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:46,000
If you go the route
that Lori's suggesting,

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,220
you don't make enough money
to sell to retailers--
Excuse me.

00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,250
Silence.

00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,130
You're the silent partner.
Here's what's--

00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,050
Here's what's good about
what I'm doing for you.

00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:57,370
I am forcing you into
a tunnel of profitability,

00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,330
where every time you get up
in the morning and make a sale,

00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:03,170
you make money.
That's a grand plan,

00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:05,100
kind of like the "titanic."
And that is the only plan.

00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,280
(Daymond)
Let me just, uh...

00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,250
don't even get involved.

00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:13,130

the deal. Um...

00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,250
I know I can make you
the millionaire quicker.

00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,070
I'm gonna offer you
the $50,000 for 30%--

00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,430
The same thing as Lori's.

00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:29,200
And your avenue would be to
get it in the retail stores?

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,400
That's the only value
that I would bring to it,

00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,420
is to roll it out to retail,
to roll it out quick,

00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,100
to roll it out globally,

00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,130
and bring you into my system
and distribute it.

00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,230
(Lori) And I can do
all of the above...
(Kevin) Aly, these--

00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,070
Just the same and more.

Stop, stop, stop.

00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,370
right after she sells
hemorrhoid cream,

00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:49,250
she'll sell your stuff and then
dental cream or something else.

00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,250

a lemonade stand this morning

in the company.

00:15:36,657 --> 00:15:38,637
Basically, we've taken
an energy drink

00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,467
and we've put it
into a waffle.

00:15:40,467 --> 00:15:43,387
Think about it--People
walk into a convenience store,

00:15:43,387 --> 00:15:46,257
and they grab an energy drink
or a shot for their energy,

00:15:46,257 --> 00:15:48,717
But they still need a snack
to satisfy their hunger.

00:15:48,717 --> 00:15:51,237
The wired waffle does both.

00:15:51,237 --> 00:15:52,587
With our proprietary
energy blend,

00:15:52,587 --> 00:15:55,417
we've been able to create
something that's delicious,

00:15:55,417 --> 00:15:58,657
functional, and designed for
today's most active lifestyles.

00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:01,257
And I've brought some samples
for you guys to try.

00:16:01,257 --> 00:16:02,637
Oh, thank you.

00:16:04,317 --> 00:16:05,707
Thank you.

00:16:05,707 --> 00:16:07,257
Thank you, sir.

00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,387
There you go.

00:16:08,387 --> 00:16:10,657
♪♪♪

00:16:18,934 --> 00:16:21,954
So who wants to shake on a deal
and make some money?

00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,266
Can I see the packaging?

00:16:26,266 --> 00:16:27,586
Absolutely.
I want to see
the ingredients.

00:16:29,436 --> 00:16:31,736
Roger, do you put anything
on it to make it taste better?

00:16:31,736 --> 00:16:33,596
Thank you.
Um, you can,

00:16:33,596 --> 00:16:36,346
But the--they were designed

00:16:36,346 --> 00:16:38,396
with the flavor already
inside of them.

00:16:38,396 --> 00:16:40,436
They taste really dry.
Is that part of the flavor?

00:16:40,436 --> 00:16:42,336
Yeah. It's, um...

00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:44,266
they were designed to be
more like a scone texture,

00:16:44,266 --> 00:16:47,266
so something that, uh, is--
is kind of complementary to--

00:16:47,266 --> 00:16:48,416
What is the shelf life
of this?

00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:49,686
It lasts for 30 days
on the shelf.

00:16:49,686 --> 00:16:51,336
This has guarana in it,
or no?

00:16:51,336 --> 00:16:53,646
No, it does not. It has
natural caffeine extract.

00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:55,516
How much caffeine is in this?

00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:57,296
Is this like drinking
five cups of coffee?

00:16:57,296 --> 00:16:58,686
It's about a 20-ounce
premium cup of coffee.

00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:01,696
Venti.
So it's really like four
or five cups of coffee?

00:17:01,696 --> 00:17:03,696
I mean, regular cups--
It's about three.
It's about three.

00:17:03,696 --> 00:17:05,596
Like, really?
So, if I--

00:17:05,596 --> 00:17:07,596
if I ate two of these,
what would happen?

00:17:07,596 --> 00:17:09,436
You'd just be--
You'd just be excited.

00:17:09,436 --> 00:17:11,466
Basically what I did is
I looked at--I looked at--

00:17:11,466 --> 00:17:14,436
Just be excited.
It would take many more than
that to get him excited.

00:17:14,436 --> 00:17:15,636
How long have you been
selling these?

00:17:15,636 --> 00:17:17,346
Where have you been
selling these?

00:17:17,346 --> 00:17:18,566
Give us some background.
Okay, Well, um,

00:17:18,566 --> 00:17:20,386
we first brought
the product to market

00:17:20,386 --> 00:17:22,296
back in October, um, for...

00:17:22,296 --> 00:17:24,396
we did a-a test run
of about 10,000 units.

00:17:24,396 --> 00:17:26,466
Based on the feedback
that we got during that time,

00:17:26,466 --> 00:17:27,566
we went back
to the drawing board,

00:17:27,566 --> 00:17:28,736
we changed the recipe,

00:17:28,736 --> 00:17:30,466
and then
we've officially launched

00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,336
This particular product
less than a month ago.

00:17:33,336 --> 00:17:34,386
What are sales, then?

00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,516
Can you give us
any indication

00:17:35,516 --> 00:17:36,636
in the first month
what you sold?

00:17:36,636 --> 00:17:38,296
Um, the first month,
right now,

00:17:38,296 --> 00:17:39,636
we're at about--
We're at about $1,000.

00:17:39,636 --> 00:17:41,586
Oh, really?

00:17:41,586 --> 00:17:43,286
$1,000.
I just got--
I got, um...

00:17:43,286 --> 00:17:45,496
you of course realize
that is absolutely nothing?

00:17:45,496 --> 00:17:46,736
Absolutely. Absolutely.

00:17:46,736 --> 00:17:49,546
Give him a chance.
He just got started.
Yeah, absolutely.

00:17:49,546 --> 00:17:51,346
So $1,000--He's Only
sold it for a month.

00:17:51,346 --> 00:17:53,666
But on Friday, I got a phone
call from one of our brokers,

00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:56,546
and he's telling me that
he's putting together an order

00:17:56,546 --> 00:17:59,296
that's 22 pallets. It could be
a $140,000 order.

00:17:59,296 --> 00:18:01,446
(Kevin) Who's buying that?
A distributor
in Dallas, Texas.

00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:03,336
And have they
ever tried it before?

00:18:03,336 --> 00:18:04,616
Actually, they have
sampled the product.

00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:06,416
They actually move
another waffle product

00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:07,736
in convenience stores,

00:18:07,736 --> 00:18:09,346
and they're thinking
they can put ours

00:18:09,346 --> 00:18:11,586
right alongside of it,
and that it'll take off.

00:18:11,586 --> 00:18:13,316
Roger, let's assume
it takes off.

00:18:13,316 --> 00:18:16,266
What stops any
confectionary operator

00:18:16,266 --> 00:18:17,636
that has massive distribution

00:18:17,636 --> 00:18:20,266
from absolutely killing you
by doing this themselves?

00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,546
There's nothing
proprietary about this.

00:18:21,546 --> 00:18:22,666
No, there--There--
There's not.

00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,316
But, you know,
the thing is,

00:18:24,316 --> 00:18:25,546
is we've--We've taken
and we've energized

00:18:25,546 --> 00:18:28,736
one of the most
recognizable comfort foods

00:18:28,736 --> 00:18:31,266
on the face of the planet.
People love waffles.

00:18:31,266 --> 00:18:32,466
So if someone's
gonna come along,

00:18:32,466 --> 00:18:33,716
they're either
gonna have to just be

00:18:33,716 --> 00:18:36,716
a blatant,
outright copy, or--
Yeah? So?

00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:40,396
You have to admit,
you have an idea.

00:18:40,396 --> 00:18:43,546
If this concept takes hold
and gets traction,

00:18:43,546 --> 00:18:47,336
you are the pioneer that'll get
the arrows in his back,

00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:49,546
because any large
confectionary operator

00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:51,386
with, you know,
industrial kitchens

00:18:51,386 --> 00:18:53,346
will slaughter you
like the cockroach you are.

00:18:53,346 --> 00:18:54,646
You know what? You say--
How do you stop that
from happening?

00:18:54,646 --> 00:18:56,446
You say that to...

00:18:56,446 --> 00:18:59,386
you know, seriously,
I am so...
You know why? It's true.

00:18:59,386 --> 00:19:01,366
I am so sick of that...

00:19:01,366 --> 00:19:03,346
Yay, Robert.
Tell it like it is.
Line from you.

00:19:03,346 --> 00:19:05,346
You know what?
You say that to everybody.

00:19:05,346 --> 00:19:07,696
Every--"you're not unique.
You don't have a patent."
I want to know the answer.

00:19:07,696 --> 00:19:09,596
Are you telling me everything
you've ever invested in,

00:19:09,596 --> 00:19:13,546
it was the only one out there?
I want a proprietary
fence around it,

00:19:13,546 --> 00:19:14,746
so it has a chance!
You're such an idiot!

00:19:14,746 --> 00:19:16,646
You want--Kevin, you know why
you want a proprietary fence?

00:19:16,646 --> 00:19:18,546
Why not?
Because you don't know how
to run a company,

00:19:18,546 --> 00:19:20,296
you don't know how
to preempt the competition...
sure I do.

00:19:20,296 --> 00:19:21,566
You don't know how to compete,
you don't know how to sell.

00:19:21,566 --> 00:19:23,496
You don't know
how to create profit.
Did all that already.

00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,516
You want--You want
it all handed to you.

00:19:25,516 --> 00:19:26,516
No.
That's just wrong.

00:19:26,516 --> 00:19:27,516
I want to make
smart investments,

00:19:27,516 --> 00:19:28,616
not stupid ones, Mark.

00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:31,636
I'm thinking about
giving you the money

00:19:31,636 --> 00:19:33,746
because it gave us
the energy to argue.

00:19:33,746 --> 00:19:35,466
(laughter)

00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:38,446
How do you stop children
from buying these?
No kidding.

00:19:38,446 --> 00:19:40,716
Because they would just be,
like, crazed, wouldn't they?

00:19:40,716 --> 00:19:42,366
There's a warning
on the label, you know,

00:19:42,366 --> 00:19:43,696
that says that it's
not intended for kids.

00:19:43,696 --> 00:19:46,266
It's not intended for,
you know, pregnant mothers.

00:19:46,266 --> 00:19:47,466
We're targeting
the same market

00:19:47,466 --> 00:19:49,286
that's going after
the energy drinks.

00:19:49,286 --> 00:19:50,386
Now I'd like to
stand here and say,

00:19:50,386 --> 00:19:51,536
you know, that
we're--We're going after

00:19:51,536 --> 00:19:54,416
the 18-
to 35-year-old market.

00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,436
But the fact is, is that
kids drink energy drinks.

00:19:56,436 --> 00:19:58,386
You know, my kids
Drink energy drinks.

00:19:58,386 --> 00:19:59,536
The neighbor kids
drink energy drinks.

00:19:59,536 --> 00:20:00,686
But, you know,
that's where Lori's right--

00:20:00,686 --> 00:20:02,436
Someone's gonna
crush you,

00:20:02,436 --> 00:20:04,646
crush you
on the selling it to kids.

00:20:04,646 --> 00:20:07,396
I do think it's a bit
of a liability nightmare.

00:20:07,396 --> 00:20:10,636
That's a lot of caffeine,
and it's a sweet.

00:20:10,636 --> 00:20:13,316
So kids are gonna
get their hands on it,

00:20:13,316 --> 00:20:15,696
and I think
that's very problematic.

00:20:15,696 --> 00:20:17,336
For that reason,

00:20:17,336 --> 00:20:18,336
I'm out.

00:20:20,736 --> 00:20:24,316
I don't really know people
that eat cold waffles.

00:20:24,316 --> 00:20:25,616
Is that something that...

00:20:25,616 --> 00:20:27,446
the product
was designed originally to--

00:20:27,446 --> 00:20:29,366
It's best heated up.

00:20:29,366 --> 00:20:32,316
But because we're going after
the convenience store market,

00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:33,686
where we're displaying,
where point of sale is,

00:20:33,686 --> 00:20:36,366
stuff is right on the counter,
it's by the coffee stuff,

00:20:36,366 --> 00:20:37,716
it's by the microwave.
But you don't
say that on here.

00:20:37,716 --> 00:20:39,636
You don't recommend
it be heated up.

00:20:42,296 --> 00:20:43,296
I don't get the product.

00:20:43,296 --> 00:20:44,366
I think
that the whole purpose

00:20:44,366 --> 00:20:45,686
energy shots are working
is it's quick.

00:20:45,686 --> 00:20:47,366
You take it, you're gone.

00:20:47,366 --> 00:20:49,536
This is becoming a process
of making a meal almost.

00:20:49,536 --> 00:20:51,366
Um, so I wish you luck,

00:20:51,366 --> 00:20:52,716
but I'm out.

00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,466
Look, Roger,
I like the idea

00:20:56,466 --> 00:20:58,336
you created
a new category...
Mm-hmm.

00:20:58,336 --> 00:21:00,546
For caffeine
energy products.

00:21:00,546 --> 00:21:04,486
I just--I just don't see
a waffle as the one

00:21:04,486 --> 00:21:06,466
that's gonna open
a market share.

00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:09,596
And for $75,000,

00:21:09,596 --> 00:21:12,286
I don't wanna bet
on waffles.

00:21:12,286 --> 00:21:13,316
I'm out.

00:21:15,386 --> 00:21:17,266
We've got, you know,

00:21:17,266 --> 00:21:19,266
I-I-I don't know what else
to say. You know--

00:21:19,266 --> 00:21:21,586
Roger, it's actually--
It's actually a good idea.

00:21:21,586 --> 00:21:24,546
I can--I can envision it
being in convenience stores,

00:21:24,546 --> 00:21:26,646
and to pick up,
and, you know,

00:21:26,646 --> 00:21:28,646
I can see somebody
saying, "Oh," you know,

00:21:28,646 --> 00:21:30,616
"peanut butter
and chocolate," you know?

00:21:30,616 --> 00:21:31,696
Energy drinks and waffles.

00:21:31,696 --> 00:21:34,296
But I don't see you
selling a lot of them.

00:21:34,296 --> 00:21:35,586
And--
Here's--Here's
the deal, mark--

00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,736
is basically, I've created
the energy blend

00:21:38,736 --> 00:21:40,396
that I can put into anything.

00:21:40,396 --> 00:21:42,286
I put it into a waffle
because we felt like

00:21:42,286 --> 00:21:44,396
we were looking
for a breakfast snack,

00:21:44,396 --> 00:21:45,666
a breakfast offering, okay?
I get it. I get that.

00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:51,286
The bad news is, I-I-I just
didn't like the product.

00:21:51,286 --> 00:21:52,486
And so for that reason,
I'm out.

00:21:52,486 --> 00:21:53,636
All right. Thanks.

00:21:53,636 --> 00:21:57,416
Caffeine is the most
consumed drug in the world.

00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,716
And that goes to my point.

00:21:58,716 --> 00:22:01,416
You know,
here's the frustration--

00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:03,366
If you had stood there
and said to me,

00:22:03,366 --> 00:22:05,736
look, I've found a unique
and proprietary way

00:22:05,736 --> 00:22:09,386
to infuse baked goods with
the most popular drug on earth,

00:22:09,386 --> 00:22:11,486
and my plan is to go
to license it

00:22:11,486 --> 00:22:14,536
to a thousand bakeries that make
food that people already eat,

00:22:14,536 --> 00:22:15,696
and brands they already know,

00:22:15,696 --> 00:22:18,346
that's a business
I would invest in.

00:22:18,346 --> 00:22:20,586
It's a proprietary
energy blend that I've created

00:22:20,586 --> 00:22:22,586
to be able
to put into anything.
Yes, but that's not
your business plan.

00:22:22,586 --> 00:22:24,416
You want to actually
establish distribution

00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:27,446
of a waffle that so far, not one
shark said they liked eating.

00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:28,586
That's the cold,
hard truth about this.

00:22:28,586 --> 00:22:30,346
It doesn't taste
that good.

00:22:31,546 --> 00:22:33,296
I'm out.

00:22:33,296 --> 00:22:34,696
Thanks, Kevin.

00:22:36,536 --> 00:22:38,386
All right. Thanks, guys.

00:22:38,386 --> 00:22:40,266
Good luck, Roger.
Thank you very much.

00:22:40,266 --> 00:22:41,386
Good luck, Roger.
I appreciate your time.

00:22:41,386 --> 00:22:42,386
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,266
Obviously, I'm disappointed.

00:22:46,266 --> 00:22:47,266
But at the end of the day,

00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:48,496
the success of our business

00:22:48,496 --> 00:22:50,396
doesn't--doesn't rest
on the shoulders of five people.

My name's Cheryl Rigdon.

I live

You could definitely say
I'm a small-town Southern girl.

00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,750
I came up with
my product idea

00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,330
when I was
putting on makeup

00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,600
to go out with my husband
for dinner.

00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,550
I was getting so frustrated
with all the makeup

00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,360
I was wasting,
having to throw away

00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,700
because I couldn't get
to the bottom of my bottle.

00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,650
So I looked online
for a product to buy,

00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,460
and there wasn't
anything there.

00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:36,450
So I just decided
to make it myself.

00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,630
My idea's really simple,

00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,730
But everyone says
that the best ideas

00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,410
are the simple ones.

00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:43,700
I know I have a great idea
that everyone would want.

00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,750
But I've never started
a business before,

00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,330
so I really need
the sharks' help.

00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,730
With one of the sharks
behind me,

00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:52,550

Hello. My name is
Cheryl Rigdon,

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,550
and I'm the creator
of the Spatty.

00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:19,150
I am asking for $50,000
for 40% of my business.

00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,300
The Spatty is
a money-saving tool

00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,540
that is gonna be in the homes
of people around the world.

00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,550
As you all know, everyone's
talking about the economy

00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,440
and how to stretch a dollar.

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,033
Take this bottle of lotion
as an example.

00:24:29,033 --> 00:24:30,667

left at the bottom.

00:24:31,817 --> 00:24:33,817
But you try to get it out
and nothing comes out.

00:24:33,817 --> 00:24:36,777
So you look around the house
for something to use.

00:24:36,777 --> 00:24:37,867
You try a spoon.

00:24:37,867 --> 00:24:40,697
It's not gonna
fit in there, obviously.

00:24:40,697 --> 00:24:41,977
You know, you try
a spatula.

00:24:41,977 --> 00:24:43,097
You know,
just the hole's too small.

00:24:43,097 --> 00:24:44,817
Nothing's gonna
fit in there.

00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:48,047
So you just have to throw
all that product in the trash.

00:24:48,047 --> 00:24:50,747
Well, I have a product
that is gonna end

00:24:50,747 --> 00:24:52,117

They're, um,
simple, versatile tools

00:25:19,767 --> 00:25:21,097
that fit inside
small openings

00:25:21,097 --> 00:25:24,117

your shampoos,

Thank you.
You're welcome.

00:25:47,027 --> 00:25:48,917
Thank you.
You're welcome.

00:25:48,917 --> 00:25:50,877
All right. I'll take
the little Spatty,

00:25:50,877 --> 00:25:52,747
and the little bottle.

00:25:52,747 --> 00:25:54,867
I figured you'd be
the little Spatty.

00:25:54,867 --> 00:25:56,827
No, no, I wanna test
the surgical precision.

00:25:56,827 --> 00:25:58,147
Where's your accent from?

00:25:58,147 --> 00:25:59,927
From Greenville,
South Carolina.

00:25:59,927 --> 00:26:01,117
Oh, it's a great accent.
Thanks.

00:26:01,117 --> 00:26:02,897
I love your accent.
I do. I love it, though.

00:26:02,897 --> 00:26:03,947
I do, too.
Thank you.

00:26:03,947 --> 00:26:05,927
So what you do,
you just put it in,

00:26:05,927 --> 00:26:08,997
and you just, um,
move it along the sides.

00:26:08,997 --> 00:26:11,897
Um, and you can see
how much comes off.

00:26:11,897 --> 00:26:13,947
Um, there's actually
a study done

00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,927
by "Consumer Reports"

00:26:15,927 --> 00:26:20,777
that shows you throw away
17% to 25% of the product.

00:26:20,777 --> 00:26:22,747
Um, let's say this is
a $60 bottle of makeup,

00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,047
that's $15.

00:26:24,047 --> 00:26:25,967
Cheryl, who makes them?
Who physically makes them?

00:26:25,967 --> 00:26:27,097
I do.

00:26:27,097 --> 00:26:28,877
Right now,
they're just prototypes.

00:26:28,877 --> 00:26:30,047
So that's why I'm asking
for the money,

00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:31,777
so I can get
these manufactured.

00:26:31,777 --> 00:26:33,097
Do you have a plan, Cheryl,
on how you're gonna sell these?

00:26:33,097 --> 00:26:34,867
Well, first, I gotta
get 'em manufactured

00:26:34,867 --> 00:26:36,117
and get 'em packaged.

00:26:36,117 --> 00:26:38,027
Let's assume we've got
all that solved.
I have to...

00:26:38,027 --> 00:26:39,817
Oh, you're--You're not
selling any at all today?

00:26:39,817 --> 00:26:41,817
I put a couple on ebay,

00:26:41,817 --> 00:26:42,967
just to see
how they would sell,

00:26:42,967 --> 00:26:44,767
and get unbiased
opinions on 'em.

00:26:44,767 --> 00:26:45,877
And kind of see
what price range

00:26:45,877 --> 00:26:48,067
people would pay for it.
And what happened?

00:26:48,067 --> 00:26:50,927
I had about 15
that sold off ebay.

00:26:50,927 --> 00:26:53,747
Everybody really liked 'em.

00:26:53,747 --> 00:26:54,997
They said,
"This is a great product.

00:26:54,997 --> 00:26:56,077
It works perfectly."

00:26:56,077 --> 00:26:58,677
And what price did you
sell it to them for?

00:26:58,677 --> 00:27:00,017
Um, $2.99 for the Spatty,

00:27:00,017 --> 00:27:01,927
$3.99 for the Spatty Daddy.

00:27:01,927 --> 00:27:03,027
How much is it gonna cost you

00:27:03,027 --> 00:27:05,677
before you can
start selling them?

00:27:05,677 --> 00:27:06,927
I called a place in Florida,

00:27:06,927 --> 00:27:09,727
and they said it would cost
a little over $9,000

00:27:09,727 --> 00:27:11,097
for the molds
for the Spatty Daddy,

00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:14,147
a little over $7,000
for the molds for the Spatty.

00:27:14,147 --> 00:27:16,117
Is there any way,
do you think,

00:27:16,117 --> 00:27:17,967
that you can test the market?

00:27:17,967 --> 00:27:19,997
'cause 15 people
on ebay...

00:27:19,997 --> 00:27:21,817
is not a lot. Yeah.
No, it's not.

00:27:21,817 --> 00:27:23,847
This stuff is sheer gold.
Yes.

00:27:23,847 --> 00:27:26,817
So if you can actually get
17% more out of a...

00:27:26,817 --> 00:27:27,847
of makeup...

00:27:27,847 --> 00:27:29,947
But will you still get
17% more out?

00:27:29,947 --> 00:27:32,867
Or will you just--Because
it doesn't get everything.

00:27:32,867 --> 00:27:34,117
You're still
gonna have--
It does if you keep--Look.

00:27:34,117 --> 00:27:35,917
It does if you keep going.

00:27:35,917 --> 00:27:38,077
I mean, if you really cared
about whatever this is,

00:27:38,077 --> 00:27:41,097
you could get 90% of
what's in here with the Spatty.

00:27:41,097 --> 00:27:42,917
I get it.
I think some people
would use it.

00:27:42,917 --> 00:27:44,827
(Lori) Some people would.

00:27:44,827 --> 00:27:45,977
(Robert) So, Cheryl,
you get the money,

00:27:45,977 --> 00:27:47,817
you get them made...

00:27:47,817 --> 00:27:49,767
What happens next?

00:27:49,767 --> 00:27:51,147
How are you
gonna sell these?

00:27:51,147 --> 00:27:54,097
I think QVC would be
a great way to go.

00:27:54,097 --> 00:27:58,927
Um, I think
that Mary Kay and Avon,

00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,917
they have a lot of people
out in the fields

00:28:00,917 --> 00:28:02,927
around the world
who sell their makeup.

00:28:02,927 --> 00:28:04,677
And they have to
test it out on people.

00:28:04,677 --> 00:28:05,747
Cheryl, the problem
with that strategy

00:28:05,747 --> 00:28:07,777
is it increases
the packaging costs...

00:28:07,777 --> 00:28:09,027
Yeah.
For a consumer goods
company.

00:28:09,027 --> 00:28:10,917
Okay.
I think the challenge
with this idea

00:28:10,917 --> 00:28:12,997
is how do you get it
into the hands

00:28:12,997 --> 00:28:15,847
of all the consumers
that can make use of it?

00:28:15,847 --> 00:28:17,047
There's a cost
to doing that.
Yeah.

00:28:17,047 --> 00:28:19,067
That is where the risk
in this deal is.

00:28:19,067 --> 00:28:22,097
You've got a really
interesting product

00:28:22,097 --> 00:28:23,747
and a great idea,

00:28:23,747 --> 00:28:26,767
but what you haven't
brought me is the plan

00:28:26,767 --> 00:28:29,097
on how you're gonna get it
into 100 million households.

00:28:29,097 --> 00:28:32,697
And so for that reason,
I'm out.

00:28:32,697 --> 00:28:33,947
Okay.

00:28:33,947 --> 00:28:35,747
Well, yeah, Kevin is
somewhat right.

00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:37,147
I mean, he's never
all the way right.

00:28:37,147 --> 00:28:38,897
He's always right.
In that it's a product,

00:28:38,897 --> 00:28:40,977
it's not a company yet.
And you know that, right?

00:28:40,977 --> 00:28:42,777
And that's why you're here
looking for help.
Yeah.

00:28:42,777 --> 00:28:45,127
The challenge is formulating
an entire company.

00:28:45,127 --> 00:28:47,897
And all the time and resources
required to do that.

00:28:47,897 --> 00:28:49,797
And I just don't have
that time.

00:28:49,797 --> 00:28:51,717
Um, so for that reason,
I'm out.

00:28:51,717 --> 00:28:54,117
Okay. Thank you.

00:28:54,117 --> 00:28:56,867
Cheryl, Mark and Kevin
are partly right.

00:28:56,867 --> 00:28:58,717
But you never know.

00:28:58,717 --> 00:29:00,927
Spatty Daddy
could be brilliant,

00:29:00,927 --> 00:29:03,767
or Spatty Daddy could be dead.

00:29:03,767 --> 00:29:05,827
The difference is gonna be
in you

00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,017
and how you take it
to the market.

00:29:08,017 --> 00:29:11,927
I'm a very, um,
goal-Oriented, um, person.

00:29:11,927 --> 00:29:13,877
I don't even like
downtime.

00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,927
I'm really bad.
It drives my husband crazy,

00:29:15,927 --> 00:29:17,797
but I can't just
go home and sit.

00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:18,997
I have to be doing something.

00:29:18,997 --> 00:29:21,977
Cheryl, I have
no doubt about you.
Yeah.

00:29:21,977 --> 00:29:25,677
I have some doubts about
Spatty Daddy as a business.
Okay.

00:29:25,677 --> 00:29:29,097
I'm out.
Okay.

00:29:29,097 --> 00:29:32,767
I don't have the finances
to make it go any further

00:29:32,767 --> 00:29:33,877
than where it is now.

00:29:33,877 --> 00:29:35,827
And that's where
I really need y'all

00:29:35,827 --> 00:29:37,817
to help me out with that.

00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:39,867
And I promise y'all
that I will work

00:29:39,867 --> 00:29:42,027
night and day
on this if need be.

00:29:43,727 --> 00:29:45,747
I think we're all
in love with you,

00:29:45,747 --> 00:29:49,847
but it's just
a little too early for us.

00:29:49,847 --> 00:29:51,097
I'm sorry. I'm out.

00:29:51,097 --> 00:29:54,767
Okay. Thank you.

00:29:54,767 --> 00:29:59,677
I think, you know, this product
would sell tremendously

00:29:59,677 --> 00:30:02,097
on QVC.

00:30:02,097 --> 00:30:04,017
Well, you know,
I love you,

00:30:04,017 --> 00:30:06,827
and I love your drive
and your determination.

00:30:06,827 --> 00:30:09,067
And I love that you thought
and created something.

00:30:09,067 --> 00:30:11,717
You had a problem,
you came up with the solution.

00:30:11,717 --> 00:30:15,827
But I think it's too inexpensive
of a price point for QVC,

00:30:15,827 --> 00:30:17,997
because people already have
to pay $5, $6...

00:30:17,997 --> 00:30:20,017
for shipping and handling.
Shipping and handling.

00:30:20,017 --> 00:30:22,017
And, uh, I see it as something

00:30:22,017 --> 00:30:23,817
that could be
a promotional item,

00:30:23,817 --> 00:30:26,817
that you could present
to avon or other places

00:30:26,817 --> 00:30:28,667
how would
you contact them?

00:30:28,667 --> 00:30:30,127
Like, if I just call them up,
would they talk to me?

00:30:30,127 --> 00:30:32,077
Or would they say,
you know...

00:30:32,077 --> 00:30:34,667
well, I would find
somebody in your area

00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:37,027
that's an avon distributor,
and talk to them,

00:30:37,027 --> 00:30:39,777
and say, "who's the head
of this region?"

00:30:39,777 --> 00:30:41,927
I think you'll go far
because of you,

00:30:41,927 --> 00:30:43,767
and because of your drive.

00:30:43,767 --> 00:30:45,127
I'm sorry. For me,

00:30:45,127 --> 00:30:47,967
I don't think it's the right
product right now.

00:30:47,967 --> 00:30:49,897
I do think
it's more promotional.

00:30:49,897 --> 00:30:52,917
And so for that reason,
I'm out.

00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:54,717
Okay.

00:30:54,717 --> 00:30:55,927
Good luck.
So thank y'all
for y'all's time.

00:30:55,927 --> 00:30:57,017
Good luck. You know
what I'm gonna do?

00:30:57,017 --> 00:30:58,097
I'm gonna give you
the number

00:30:58,097 --> 00:30:59,897
to two of
the big makeup people...

00:30:59,897 --> 00:31:01,667
Oh, that'd be great.
And I'll let you
contact them, okay?

00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:02,717
Thank you.
That'd be awesome.

00:31:02,717 --> 00:31:04,047
Thank you so much.
No problem. Good luck.

00:31:04,047 --> 00:31:05,047
All right. Thank you.

00:31:05,047 --> 00:31:06,867
All right. Bye.
Thank y'all.

00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:07,867
Bye.

00:31:10,917 --> 00:31:13,017
The sharks gave me
some great advice in the tank,

00:31:13,017 --> 00:31:14,997
and I hope they smile
when they see the Spatty

00:31:14,997 --> 00:31:16,827
and the Spatty Daddy
on the shelf.

00:31:26,133 --> 00:31:27,483
Next up are
Brandon and Keith Marz,

00:31:27,483 --> 00:31:29,283
with a product designed

00:31:29,283 --> 00:31:31,453
to make it easier
to be health-conscious.

00:31:38,153 --> 00:31:40,513
Hello. My name
is Brandon Marz,

00:31:40,513 --> 00:31:42,263
this is my dad Keith,

00:31:42,263 --> 00:31:44,453
and our company
is Marz Sprays.

00:31:44,453 --> 00:31:47,063
We're seeking $200,000

00:31:47,063 --> 00:31:50,103
for a 10% equity interest
in our company.

00:31:50,103 --> 00:31:52,103
We're here today to talk
about something

00:31:52,103 --> 00:31:53,463
that nobody likes to do,

00:31:53,463 --> 00:31:55,363
and that's swallow pills.

00:31:55,363 --> 00:31:57,313
We all like
the benefits we get

00:31:57,313 --> 00:31:59,353
from vitamins
and supplements.

00:31:59,353 --> 00:32:02,333
But did you know
that over 100 million people

00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:05,303
in the United States Alone
cannot or have difficulty

00:32:05,303 --> 00:32:06,413
swallowing pills?

00:32:06,413 --> 00:32:08,533
What's worse,
they might not even work.

00:32:08,533 --> 00:32:11,333
If you took a vitamin b
or a vitamin c pill

00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:13,463
That may look like
it's the size of Pittsburgh,

00:32:13,463 --> 00:32:16,313
you may only absorb
10% or 20% of it.

00:32:16,313 --> 00:32:17,503
As a father of two boys

00:32:17,503 --> 00:32:21,063
who refused to swallow
any pills,

00:32:21,063 --> 00:32:22,403
I knew something
had to be done.

00:32:22,403 --> 00:32:24,513
So we developed
Marz Sprays--

00:32:24,513 --> 00:32:28,433
a full line of oral sprays
for health and wellness.

00:32:28,433 --> 00:32:32,383
C-Spray is our multivitamin
immunity blend,

00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:33,483
which has as much
Vitamin c

00:32:33,483 --> 00:32:35,263
as 114 oranges.

00:32:35,263 --> 00:32:37,403
Kids spray has
the real nutrients

00:32:37,403 --> 00:32:39,533
from all these real
fruits and vegetables.

00:32:39,533 --> 00:32:41,303
Slim spray was developed

00:32:41,303 --> 00:32:44,133
with the assistance
of doctors and phds

00:32:44,133 --> 00:32:45,513
to help reduce
food cravings.

00:32:45,513 --> 00:32:48,183
Reboot is our energy spray,

00:32:48,183 --> 00:32:50,503
which has a megadose
of vitamin b-12.

00:32:50,503 --> 00:32:54,103
If you bought 1 energy shot
each day for 30 days,

00:32:54,103 --> 00:32:55,303
you'd spend over $100.

00:32:55,303 --> 00:32:58,233
Reboot retails for $14.99,

00:32:58,233 --> 00:33:00,163
and lasts an entire month.

00:33:00,163 --> 00:33:03,463
Sleep spray has three well-Known
sleep aid ingredients--

00:33:03,463 --> 00:33:06,433
Gaba, melatonin,
and valerian root.

00:33:06,433 --> 00:33:08,083
I'll try the reboot.

00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:09,363
I want the reboot, too.
Hit me.

00:33:09,363 --> 00:33:12,083
No problem.
And can I look at the c-Spray?

00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:13,253
Sure.
Give her the sleep spray.

00:33:13,253 --> 00:33:14,253
(laughs)
(Mark) Please.

00:33:14,253 --> 00:33:16,363
Thank you, Brandon.
My pleasure.

00:33:16,363 --> 00:33:17,433
Spray it
in your mouth.

00:33:17,433 --> 00:33:19,133
(spritzes)

00:33:19,133 --> 00:33:20,253
Wow. That's really strong.

00:33:20,253 --> 00:33:21,533
Whoo! (coughs) Oh!

00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:23,413
Reboot.
Reboot for you?

00:33:23,413 --> 00:33:25,453
Lot of energy takers
in the crowd.

00:33:25,453 --> 00:33:28,413
(spritzing)

00:33:28,413 --> 00:33:30,103
It's got an awful taste.

00:33:30,103 --> 00:33:32,213
Chocolate?
It's chocolate.
Yeah.

00:33:32,213 --> 00:33:33,453
It's chocolate. That's 'cause
you don't like sweets.

00:33:33,453 --> 00:33:36,213
We also have created
and paid for and developed

00:33:36,213 --> 00:33:38,113
five infomercials.

00:33:38,113 --> 00:33:39,263
In fact,
I could show you one.

00:33:39,263 --> 00:33:41,203
I have it on my phone.

00:33:41,203 --> 00:33:42,463
Since I have
a t-Mobile phone,

00:33:42,463 --> 00:33:44,363
I can just share it
on that tv.

00:33:45,483 --> 00:33:46,967
Vitamin c.

00:33:46,967 --> 00:33:48,567
(laughs) You know it's good

00:33:48,567 --> 00:33:49,867
for supporting
your immune system.

00:33:49,867 --> 00:33:51,767
If you've taken
vitamin C pills or powders

00:33:51,767 --> 00:33:55,517
for any of these benefits,
then get ready,

00:33:55,517 --> 00:33:58,437
because the next evolution
of vitamin c is here,

00:33:58,437 --> 00:34:01,487
and it's as simple
as spray... Spray.

00:34:01,487 --> 00:34:03,567
C-Spray daily
immune system support.

00:34:03,567 --> 00:34:05,437
Hmm.
Not bad.

00:34:05,437 --> 00:34:06,567
Very good.
It's Nicely done.

00:34:06,567 --> 00:34:07,797
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:34:07,797 --> 00:34:09,817
So why do you feel
that this is a solution

00:34:09,817 --> 00:34:11,637
to the people
that have to take pills?

00:34:11,637 --> 00:34:13,867
For the 100
to 150 million people

00:34:13,867 --> 00:34:15,767
that can't swallow pills...

00:34:15,767 --> 00:34:17,567
and where did you get
this data from?

00:34:17,567 --> 00:34:19,867
'cause you're saying
almost half of America...
40%.

00:34:19,867 --> 00:34:21,597
Will not take pills.
That was a study done

00:34:21,597 --> 00:34:23,647
by a company called
Harris interactive.

00:34:23,647 --> 00:34:26,547
But you realize how stupid
it all sounds, right?

00:34:26,547 --> 00:34:27,737
You're saying that everybody

00:34:27,737 --> 00:34:31,587
who delivers anything via pill
is so stupid

00:34:31,587 --> 00:34:34,747
they can't figure out
that there's this big market...
Oh, no, no, no.

00:34:34,747 --> 00:34:35,867
For alternative
deliveries.

00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:37,597
They're not stupid.

00:34:37,597 --> 00:34:38,897
They have a market share
that's fine with them.

00:34:38,897 --> 00:34:40,547
There's lots of companies

00:34:40,547 --> 00:34:42,717
offering homeopathic
alternatives using sprays.

00:34:42,717 --> 00:34:45,497
There's
no major market Leader.

00:34:45,497 --> 00:34:47,487
We're poised
to be that Leader.
So you're saying...

00:34:47,487 --> 00:34:49,437
Well, Wait, wait, wait.
What about vitamins?
There's so many--
Wait, wait, wait.

00:34:49,437 --> 00:34:50,737
You're saying
there's so many competitors,

00:34:50,737 --> 00:34:52,537
that none of them
has really taken the lead,

00:34:52,537 --> 00:34:53,897
and you wanna compete
with all of them?
No. We're saying--

00:34:53,897 --> 00:34:56,837
But wait, Mark...
Mark, I think you took
a different spray than I did.

00:34:56,837 --> 00:34:58,697
You seem very irritable
about this.

00:34:58,697 --> 00:35:00,897
It's a scam!

00:35:00,897 --> 00:35:02,447
I mean, it's a hustle, right?

00:35:02,447 --> 00:35:03,647
I mean, it's a hustle.
Wait a second.

00:35:03,647 --> 00:35:05,837
The whole supplement market's
a hustle.
Exactly.

00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:07,887
Hey, Yeah, Keith,
he just called you a hustler.

00:35:07,887 --> 00:35:09,887
Now hold it, Keith.
I know, and I was
offended by that,

00:35:09,887 --> 00:35:11,667
because--
Guys. Guys.

00:35:11,667 --> 00:35:13,567
Your answer is simple--

00:35:13,567 --> 00:35:15,797
The supplement market is
a multibillion-dollar market.

00:35:15,797 --> 00:35:17,567
So why don't you
just say that?

00:35:17,567 --> 00:35:19,537
Do I have to say that for you?
What's the matter with you guys?

00:35:19,537 --> 00:35:20,587
Brandon, holy crap!

00:35:20,587 --> 00:35:22,467
What did you give us
in this?

00:35:22,467 --> 00:35:23,737
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

00:35:23,737 --> 00:35:25,747
Let's all stop.
Lots of b-12.

00:35:25,747 --> 00:35:26,847
It's very good for you.
Trust me.
They're feeling like
chum in the water.

00:35:26,847 --> 00:35:28,467
It works.

00:35:28,467 --> 00:35:30,447
To answer your question,
we're not hustlers.

00:35:30,447 --> 00:35:31,537
We have first mover advantage.

00:35:31,537 --> 00:35:32,897
But, Brandon,
prove us wrong.

00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:34,817
Do you have any sales?
Yes.

00:35:34,817 --> 00:35:37,847
So originally, we only
had one product,

00:35:37,847 --> 00:35:39,637
which was
the slim spray product,

00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:42,647
and we sold that
in some small retail locations

00:35:42,647 --> 00:35:43,837
and to one distributor.

00:35:43,837 --> 00:35:45,567
Give me a number!

00:35:45,567 --> 00:35:47,597
You need to hear
the story.
I'm jacked up on b-12! Hit me.

00:35:47,597 --> 00:35:49,717
He's--he's--he's gonna
give you an answer.

00:35:49,717 --> 00:35:50,737
In about nine months,

00:35:50,737 --> 00:35:52,667
we did about $125,000
of sales.

00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:54,887
What are your total sales,
all products?

00:35:54,887 --> 00:35:56,597
Keep in mind these products,

00:35:56,597 --> 00:35:58,517
as you see them
packaged here today,

00:35:58,517 --> 00:35:59,687
entered into
our fulfillment center

00:35:59,687 --> 00:36:01,537
nine business days ago.

00:36:01,537 --> 00:36:02,797
We attended and exhibited

00:36:02,797 --> 00:36:04,617
at the largest
vitamin supplement conference

00:36:04,617 --> 00:36:05,697
in the world.

00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:07,897
The response
was absolutely overwhelming.

00:36:07,897 --> 00:36:10,667
One of the first people
that asked for an appointment

00:36:10,667 --> 00:36:13,867
was one of the biggest pill
companies in the United States.

00:36:13,867 --> 00:36:15,567
What company?

00:36:15,567 --> 00:36:16,887
Nature's--Nature's made.
Nature's made.

00:36:16,887 --> 00:36:19,567
Now that's interesting.

00:36:19,567 --> 00:36:21,537
So they're interested?

00:36:21,537 --> 00:36:23,547
We're negotiating a licensing
agreement with them right now.
They want--

00:36:23,547 --> 00:36:24,837
and--and that's the answer
to mark's question.

00:36:24,837 --> 00:36:27,567
They want to do
a licensing agreement.

00:36:27,567 --> 00:36:28,847
Now why is that?

00:36:28,847 --> 00:36:32,617
Because they have
144 different S.K.U.S

00:36:32,617 --> 00:36:35,747
so they don't need
to be in our business.

00:36:35,747 --> 00:36:36,847
But, Keith, hang on a sec.

00:36:36,847 --> 00:36:39,847
I know you didn't invent
the ability to spray...

00:36:39,847 --> 00:36:41,437
absolutely not.
Right.

00:36:41,437 --> 00:36:42,647
So what do they want
from you?

00:36:42,647 --> 00:36:43,897
They specifically came
to us and said,

00:36:43,897 --> 00:36:46,837
"we don't have the capacity
to make an oral spray.

00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:49,717
You've done a great job doing
it. We want to license it."

00:36:51,617 --> 00:36:53,717
We also have
five pending purchase Orders

00:36:53,717 --> 00:36:55,437
for over a million dollars.

00:36:55,437 --> 00:36:57,887
Whoa.
Why are they pending?
What's the pending?

00:36:57,887 --> 00:36:59,737
The reason they're pending--and
that's a very valid question.
It's a good question.

00:36:59,737 --> 00:37:01,647
We went to
an international conference

00:37:01,647 --> 00:37:03,647
where buyers came
from all over the world.

00:37:03,647 --> 00:37:05,597
The only reason
it's pending...
it's europe.

00:37:05,597 --> 00:37:07,537
They have to clear it.
Is because we haven't
registered our product...

00:37:07,537 --> 00:37:09,647
they have to clear it.
Yes.
In their
respective countries.

00:37:09,647 --> 00:37:11,467
We've hired a consultant
out of France

00:37:11,467 --> 00:37:14,437
that's right now
registering our products

00:37:14,437 --> 00:37:16,647
in the seven countries that we
have interest from originally.

00:37:16,647 --> 00:37:18,567
You know, registering
each one of those countries

00:37:18,567 --> 00:37:19,867
takes a long period
of time.

00:37:19,867 --> 00:37:21,847
It's like every version
of the F.D.A.,

00:37:21,847 --> 00:37:23,547
and it make take
six months, a year.

00:37:23,547 --> 00:37:25,467
There's gonna be
a lot of challenges

00:37:25,467 --> 00:37:27,847
with claims, labels,
international shipping.

00:37:27,847 --> 00:37:29,597
A lot
of those other countries

00:37:29,597 --> 00:37:31,697
are way more stringent
than we are.

00:37:31,697 --> 00:37:32,787
We've been quoted 60 to 90 days

00:37:32,787 --> 00:37:34,667
for the full registration
process.

00:37:34,667 --> 00:37:37,817
I know it'll take longer because
I've--I've dealt in this.

00:37:37,817 --> 00:37:38,817
I'm out.

00:37:43,617 --> 00:37:44,887
I-I will tell you this--

00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,497
The reboot stuff
really works.

00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:48,487
I'm hyper enough.
Look at him.

00:37:48,487 --> 00:37:50,867
Um, I'm not
a big supplement guy.

00:37:50,867 --> 00:37:53,867
I never gave external
vitamins to my kids.

00:37:53,867 --> 00:37:57,447
I think there's way too much
of that going on in society.

00:37:57,447 --> 00:37:59,887
I find the whole thing
hard to swallow.

00:37:59,887 --> 00:38:01,467
I'm out.

00:38:03,687 --> 00:38:05,647
I'm not a big believer

00:38:05,647 --> 00:38:07,547
that you have anything
that's protectable.

00:38:07,547 --> 00:38:10,647
I think you've vastly
underestimated

00:38:10,647 --> 00:38:11,867
How much money
it's gonna take

00:38:11,867 --> 00:38:13,597
to become "the brand."

00:38:13,597 --> 00:38:15,517
I don't think
it has to be protected

00:38:15,517 --> 00:38:17,537
for us to be the Leader
in this industry.

00:38:17,537 --> 00:38:18,537
I'm out.

00:38:21,687 --> 00:38:22,737
Thank you.

00:38:22,737 --> 00:38:25,537
You're welcome.

00:38:25,537 --> 00:38:28,597
Lori, together, we can
make a lot of money.

00:38:29,747 --> 00:38:31,767
Well, here's the thing.

00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:34,897
I like what you're doing,

00:38:34,897 --> 00:38:36,537
so I'm gonna
make you an offer.

00:38:39,797 --> 00:38:42,497
♪♪♪

00:38:45,597 --> 00:38:47,266
♪♪♪

00:38:47,266 --> 00:38:49,156
Three sharks are out.

00:38:49,156 --> 00:38:52,266
Kevin and Lori are
Brandon and Keith's last chance

00:38:52,266 --> 00:38:54,006
to make a deal.

00:38:54,006 --> 00:38:55,166
Well, here's the thing.

00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,206
I like what you're doing.

00:38:57,206 --> 00:39:00,956
I'm into
the vitamin industry.

00:39:00,956 --> 00:39:03,116
I like
the homeopathic industry.

00:39:03,116 --> 00:39:04,256
I believe in both.

00:39:04,256 --> 00:39:09,086
And I like the fact
that this is an oral spray.

00:39:09,086 --> 00:39:12,036
So I'm gonna
make you an offer.

00:39:12,036 --> 00:39:15,306
I'm gonna offer you $200,000,

00:39:15,306 --> 00:39:18,106
but I want 30% of the company

00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:22,066
contingent upon you getting
the nature's made deal.

00:39:22,066 --> 00:39:24,316
Thank you very much
for the offer.

00:39:24,316 --> 00:39:27,056
I think there's one more,
just in fairness,

00:39:27,056 --> 00:39:28,066
that we're waiting for,

00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:29,116
and that's you,
Mr. Wonderful.

00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:31,966
Hmm. Interesting.

00:39:31,966 --> 00:39:34,966
I also like this space
because of its size.

00:39:34,966 --> 00:39:36,886
I like what Lori
brings to the table,

00:39:36,886 --> 00:39:38,866
and we don't--We don't
participate together very often,

00:39:38,866 --> 00:39:41,006
but I love
her leverage on tv.

00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:42,886
Why does she need you?
But--Wait.

00:39:42,886 --> 00:39:44,266
Silence, please.

00:39:44,266 --> 00:39:49,336
I say we give 'em
$250,000 for 40%.

00:39:51,266 --> 00:39:55,016
I'd rather do it alone.

00:39:55,016 --> 00:39:57,086
Well, because I threw her
an Olive leaf,

00:39:57,086 --> 00:39:58,956
and she stepped on it...
she did.

00:39:58,956 --> 00:40:00,166
I am forced to do this--

00:40:00,166 --> 00:40:03,016
I will give you
the $200,000 for 25%.

00:40:04,266 --> 00:40:07,156
Do not screw
with Mr. Wonderful.

00:40:09,936 --> 00:40:12,036
Guys, two deals on the table.

00:40:12,036 --> 00:40:15,036
Mr. Wonderful--
$200,000 for 25%.

00:40:15,036 --> 00:40:17,306
Lori--$200,000 for 30%.

00:40:17,306 --> 00:40:21,306
I've never seen a man sweat
as much in my life.

00:40:21,306 --> 00:40:24,336
(laughter)

00:40:24,336 --> 00:40:27,266
I will match Kevin's deal.

00:40:27,266 --> 00:40:28,936
Wow!

00:40:28,936 --> 00:40:32,036
Is this not a moment
where you thank Mr. Wonderful?

00:40:32,036 --> 00:40:33,356
Without his bid...
the undertaker.

00:40:33,356 --> 00:40:35,866
You would have had somebody
take an extra 5%.

00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:39,016
You should give that to me
for free.

00:40:39,016 --> 00:40:40,916
Lori, can I ask you a question?

00:40:40,916 --> 00:40:42,216
I'm in this for the equity.

00:40:42,216 --> 00:40:44,986
Would you give me
a redemption option

00:40:44,986 --> 00:40:49,206
to buy back half the stock
at three times your investment?

00:40:49,206 --> 00:40:50,916
You keep half.

00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:53,086
That way we both can get
very rich together.

00:40:53,086 --> 00:40:55,916
You believe in it so much?
Then buy it back at four times.

00:40:59,906 --> 00:41:02,036
Kevin, did you hear
our proposal to Lori?

00:41:02,036 --> 00:41:04,116
I never participate
in options

00:41:04,116 --> 00:41:06,056
where I am not getting
any upside.

00:41:06,056 --> 00:41:08,916
This is an equity deal.
We're partners together.

00:41:08,916 --> 00:41:10,906
It's unfair
for one partner to say,

00:41:10,906 --> 00:41:12,866
"listen, after all
the risks have been taken,

00:41:12,866 --> 00:41:14,866
"and things are on fire,
and it's working,

00:41:14,866 --> 00:41:16,986
I call back my equity."

00:41:16,986 --> 00:41:20,966
But remember--
The original deal was for 10%.

00:41:20,966 --> 00:41:24,136
So the difference was something
that you threw out there.

00:41:24,136 --> 00:41:26,206
You're gonna lose
both deals in a second.

00:41:26,206 --> 00:41:29,016
Lori, we came here wanting
to be partners with you.

00:41:29,016 --> 00:41:30,136
There's no question

00:41:30,136 --> 00:41:33,336
you are gonna bring
this product to America.

00:41:33,336 --> 00:41:35,356
One last shot--Will you
consider 20%,

00:41:35,356 --> 00:41:37,056
same deal,
and we have a deal?

00:41:38,866 --> 00:41:41,866
We buy back half,
20%, $200,000.

00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:43,166
What--

00:41:43,166 --> 00:41:44,236
No.

00:41:44,236 --> 00:41:47,986
Okay. 25% is your deal?

00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:51,206
You got a deal, Lori.
Great.

00:41:51,206 --> 00:41:54,086
Whoo!
All right.

00:41:54,086 --> 00:41:56,186
This is gonna be great.
We're very excited
to be partners.

00:41:56,186 --> 00:41:57,906
I gotta tell you,
I did not see that

00:41:57,906 --> 00:42:00,216
ending up the way it did.

00:42:00,216 --> 00:42:03,016
Congratulations.
Thanks so much.

00:42:03,016 --> 00:42:05,016
You got hustled, Lori.

00:42:05,016 --> 00:42:06,186
(laughs) I did not get hustled.

00:42:06,186 --> 00:42:07,186
The buyback...
is bad.

00:42:07,186 --> 00:42:08,316
The buyback was ridiculous.

00:42:08,316 --> 00:42:10,006
No. She didn't agree
to the buyback.

00:42:10,006 --> 00:42:11,116
Yes, she did.
You agreed
to the buyback?

00:42:11,116 --> 00:42:13,056
Four times. Four times.

00:42:13,056 --> 00:42:15,316
Lori, he out-sharked you
on that one.
That's his company--

00:42:15,316 --> 00:42:17,136
No, he didn't.
That's his company,

00:42:17,136 --> 00:42:20,286
and he has the right to have
the major stake in it.

00:42:20,286 --> 00:42:22,316
After you've taken
all the risk?
It--It--

00:42:22,316 --> 00:42:25,006
Help make us popular,
and then get out of here?
You guys, this is the decision

00:42:25,006 --> 00:42:27,136
that I made.
I made it for my reasons,

00:42:27,136 --> 00:42:29,186
and I think
it was the right decision.

00:42:29,186 --> 00:42:30,316
You cost us a fortune.
I did what
I thought was right,

00:42:30,316 --> 00:42:33,216
and--And I feel good about it.

00:42:33,216 --> 00:42:34,306
Whew!
