(man) The sharks are back

00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:04,480
in an all-new season
of "Shark Tank,"

00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,230
where hopeful entrepreneurs
from across the country

00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,100
dream of a chance
to secure an investment

00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,070
and gain powerful partners

00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,280
to start, grow, or save
their businesses.

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,030
It's the only one
of its kind.

00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:18,470
We can't keep up
with our own demand.

00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,030
Fantastic.

00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,280
If the sharks hear
a great idea,

00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,480
they're ready to invest using
their own money,

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,370
and they'll fight each other
for a piece of the action.

00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,120
You're valuing this business
at over a million bucks.

00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,370
You haven't heard a word
about the business.
He's acting like a greedy pig.

00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,100
Pipe down, little man.
Ooh.

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,300
But first, the entrepreneurs
must convince a shark

00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,300
to invest the full amount
they're asking for

00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,280
or they'll walk away
with nothing.

00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,120

You better be working
16 hours a day on our business.

Sorry. What did you say?
Ay, yi yi.

Great question.

00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,220

get the access and the pricing
that we have.

00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,430
You grow up with it.
But you're saying

00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,450
you're the only one
who can get this?
So they are your family?

00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,050
They're not family, but we--
the Mainers. The roots.

00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,480
We grew up with them.
Be careful with that.

00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,330
There are multiple suppliers
of lobster meat in Maine.

There are multiple suppliers
of lobsters,

00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,270
but it just depends on

00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,130
the pricing
that you're getting it at

00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:04,330
in order to ship it wholesale
across the country.

00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,180

because--
Because This is where

00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,220
I'm getting a little concerned,

Basically, you wanna buy
another truck with my $55,000.

00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,480

You haven't heard a word

I know the business already,
Mark.

00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,430
So what are you worried
about the valuation?
They may have ten trucks,

00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,020
so you--How many trucks
do you have?

00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,370

Twitter, web site,
social media.
Social media.

00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,070
Okay, then let me ask you this.

00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:45,020
Let's say I want to be
in the lobster business.

00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,380
Mr. Wonderful's lobster, okay?
Mm-hmm.

00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,170

Why don't I just go get

00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,330
a couple of guys
with flip-flops on,

00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,200

"I've got money.
You've got lobsters"...

00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,300
Mm-hmm.
And do this whole thing
myself?

00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,300
Why are you worth
$1.1 million?
We--

00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,170
Come back with an answer

00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,420
that maybe you won't
get sliced up into bun with.

00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:08,270
You can start your own truck
and you can hire your own staff.

00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,080
But what you can't do
is what you just said

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,330
and call up on the phone
to Maine.

00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,170
They don't do business
with other guys outside.

00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,080
It's not--It's not like that.

00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,330
So you're the only guys--

00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,020
'cause you've only even been
in business two months--

00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,120
These guys only deal
with you now because they--

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,080
they haven't been in business
the last 50 years?

00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,330
No, no, no. Of course.
You know, they have.

00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,170

00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,300
It's not--It's not greed.

00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,070
You haven't gotten into
the economics per truck.

00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,180
Right.
You haven't talked about
seasonality.

00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,400
You haven't talked about
any other cost issues

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,020
that might come along.

00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,380
Right. So we're locked into
our pricing,

00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,120
and typically, prices will rise.

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,330
With our connections and what
we have with our supplier,

00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,000
we're locked in.
What we're paying right now,

00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,180
we're gonna be paying
in the winter.

00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,480
So what are you paying
right now on a--

00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,220
what's the average?

00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,450
The traditional lobster roll,
we price at $13.

00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,080
What's your cost on that?

00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,300
$5.85.

00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,420
Guys,
I asked you the question

00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,470
about the economics
of the truck.
Mm-hmm.

00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,350
So please,
somebody who might invest,

00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:04,270
tell me what the economics are
per truck.

00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,000
Okay, so we'll start with,
how much is a purchase?

00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,300
You buy it for roughly--
Ours was $65,000.

00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,370
Okay.

00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,320
Monthly overhead
with our employees--

00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,450
$20,000.

00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,270
Per truck or...
per truck.

00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,420
Okay.
(Daymond and Robert) a month?

00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,420
A month. Mm-Hmm.
Okay, so 20k per month
per truck.

00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,000
If you have
more than one truck,

00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,320
does it get advertised
across the truck?

00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,350
The overhead would actually
go down a little

00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,400
because we've hired
a general manager.

00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,100
You're not the general manager
in this little business?

00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,070
(stammers)
Well--Well--Well,
there's a reason why that,

00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,030
is because when we got
into this business,

00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,200
we knew a lot about lobster.

00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,050
We knew a lot about
the service industry.

00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,430
We didn't know a lot about
the trucking business.

00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,070
How did you get
into the business?

00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,030
How'd you get from Maine to...

00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,400
(Jim) Great question. We--
Bring your lobster
over here to California?

00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,170
So we both grew up in Maine.

00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,170
And, uh, he's been out here
about eight years--Sabin has.

00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,350
What brought you out here
eight years ago?

00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,050
I used to do a lot of acting,

00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,170
and I translated
that into, uh, real estate

00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,050
and I've become successful
at real estate.

00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,400
It allowed me to--to save
some money and do well.

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,180
He's still a great actor.

00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,050
He's acting like a greedy pig,
asking for $55,000 for 5%.

00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,220
No. No. Honestly, we're not
trying to be greedy.

00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,050
What is in it for us?

00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,000
To be a part of this family,
just like we need you.
And to make money.

00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,180
Guys, these guys are talking
all kinds of nonsense.

00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,030
I had asked you what
the economics of the truck were.

00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,200
You know what?
Because you thought it was

00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,350
more important
to talk about all the nonsense

00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,230
and couldn't see through
the nonsense...
that's not fair, Mark.

00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:25,080
I'm out.

00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,250
Oh, my god, mark. What?
Yeah, what's that about?

00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,000
(Kevin) He was never in.
It was a simple question.

00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,080
It was a simple question.
You guys went--
(Robert) wow.

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,280
They weren't ignoring you.

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,470
You're starting to act
like Daymond, like a baby.

00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,380
(laughs)
OHH!

00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,130
So why don't you--
So why don't you let it go?
No, 'cause I--

00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,250
I asked it twice. I asked
the question twice, not once.

00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,420
So, Barb, are you gonna
write 'em a check?

00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,330
You know what?
I am gonna write them a check.

00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,420
Yes, I am, big mouth.
Pipe down, little man.
Let's go. Let's go.

00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,080
(Robert) All right,
write 'em a check.
Barb, just 'cause
you're an old crab

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,400
doesn't mean you should get
into the lobster business.

00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,480
Whoa! Daymond!

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,130
Are there other competitors?

00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,330
There--Sometimes there are
two other competitors,

00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,150
to our knowledge.

00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,050
Are they selling
Maine lobster like you?

00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,220
Of course they are.
There's none in Texas.

00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,270
Who cares? Who cares where
the lobsters come from?

00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,420
(laughs)
Guys, here. Help me,

00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,020
'cause--'cause I like the idea.

00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,150
Yes.
And I know this is very hot
and people are loving this.

00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:08,380
Help me get to the $1 million--
$1.1 million valuation.

00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,250
It's so high.
It's so ridiculous. Yes.

00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,000
It's outrageous,
what you're asking for.

00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,050
Okay.
I can't take anymore.

00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,430
For the sake of lobsters
who are still alive, I'm out.

00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,220
Okay.

00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,300
So the bottom feeder's out.
(Jim chuckles)

00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,380
to--to your point,

00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,350
we are first month, $65,000.

00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,420
The second month, $85,000.

00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,180
Fantastic.
We're getting calls
'round the clock.

00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,430
We have to turn down
catering events.

00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,120
We're getting--
We're turning down business.

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,180
I'm gonna tell you
the honest truth.

00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,350
Maybe you don't know this
about my history.

00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,300
I was a commercial fisherman
for a year...

00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,030
Yep.
And I worked
in a red lobster for ages.

00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,120
(Jim and Sabin)
We did know that.
All right?

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,000
So I do understand
a little bit of the market.

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,230
You're making everything--

00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,370
The fact that you just have
a contact in Maine?

00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,220
I mean, one of the only places
you can buy lobster,

00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,430
which everybody
buys lobster from.

00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:54,420
So for $55,000,
you are offering 5%.

00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,370
That is crazy.

00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:59,380
You're kinda like
halfway in a body bag

00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,280
without the zipper pulled up
right now.

00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,220
Give me your best offer.

00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,480
♪♪♪

00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,200
♪♪♪

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,050
Two sharks are out.

00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,380
Daymond is interested,

00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,180
but by asking for $55,000
for only 5% of their company,

00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,100
he feels Sabin and Jim have

00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,120
grossly overvalued
their company

00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,080
and has given them
one last chance

00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,380
to make him a better offer.

00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,250
Give me your best offer.

00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,300
I mean...

00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,980
I would feel
really comfortable

00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,180
right around the 7% to 8%.

00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,970
(sharks laugh)

00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,030
You know what?
You're a very good actor.

00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,150
You said that
with a straight face.

00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,320
So, uh, I'm out.

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,370
Okay. Okay.

00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,280
Thank you.

00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,080
Ay, yi yi.

00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,100
I really like you guys.
I think you're hustlers.

00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,370
I like to invest in people
that like to get up every day

00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,980
and work their Butts off.

00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,180
And that's what we're doing.
Right.

00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,120
So I'll give you the $55,000,

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,280
but I want 25%.

00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,080
Okay.
Okay.

00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,180
Is that an offer
you would entertain?

00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,180
I do not think so, no.
(speaks indistinctly)

00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,230
Can we hear Barbara's?

00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:31,300
Well, I'm going
to offer you your $55,000,

00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,150
and--But for
that amount of money,

00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:37,950
I would like to have 17%
of your business.

00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,000
17%.

00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And you--And you know why?

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,350
'cause 17's my lucky number.

00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:46,900
Sabin, I'm really good at
building businesses quickly.

00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,380
Hey, I think the way
I'm gonna get my money back

00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,270
is by having more trucks
on the street.

00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,180
So let me change my offer.

00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,930
I'll give you $100,000, 'cause
I think you need more money

00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,250
to get more trucks
on the street.

00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,380
So $100,000 for 25%.

00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,080
You don't need that much money,
do you?

00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,180
(sighs)

00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:10,180
You've got one offer
for $100,000 for 25%,

00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:13,170
and Barbara, who likes
the lucky number 17...

00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,300
who's randomly pulling
your value out of the air,

00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,370
which she often does.

00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:19,000
What are you going to do?

00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,970
Our last question--

00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:26,250
Strategies? Thoughts that
you guys might have?

00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,330
Great question.

00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,150
The best thing
I could do for you

00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:33,380
which this guy cannot do is,
I am a genius marketer.

00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,950
I am. I have it in my bones,
in my blood.

00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,370
It always works.
I'm never wrong.

00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,180
I think your truck is terrible.

00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,180
Forgive me. Don't feel offended.
It's not a personal thing.

00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,930
I can't believe
your two handsome faces

00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,070
aren't side-By-Side
in caricatures as the cousins.

00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,920
I don't even like the fact that
"Cousins Maine lobster"

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,070
doesn't say
"Cousins fresh Maine lobster."

00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,230
It should have "fresh" in there.

00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,030
Let me get my hands
in that business

00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,370
and I'll tell you
everything wrong with it.

00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,280
I have to agree
with Krusty krab over there.

00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,370
She has some
great marketing ideas.

00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,080
All right, let--Let me answer
that question.

00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,330
Uh, you gotta be kidding me.

00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:10,200
There's a reason I'm up here.

00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,320
I-I don't need to prove
what I can do...

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,200
But they asked you.
To you.

00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,300
You wanna go in
and change their business?

00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,170
Do you need a job, Barbara?
I wanna help them.

00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,130
Go ahead.
My offer's off the table.
No, I help every entrepreneur

00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,930
I'm in business with.
You're left with Barbara.
I have a job.

00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,350
Robert, you're out?
I'm out.

00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:30,144
That was the butter and lemon
right there.

00:13:30,144 --> 00:13:32,084
Okay, So, uh...

00:13:32,084 --> 00:13:35,894
Barbara,
would you consider 12%?

00:13:35,894 --> 00:13:37,794
(chuckles)

00:13:37,794 --> 00:13:38,914
(mouths word)

00:13:38,914 --> 00:13:41,094
Okay.

00:13:41,094 --> 00:13:43,934
Why are you guys holding on
so tightly to the equity?

00:13:43,934 --> 00:13:45,764
Because it's--It's--
It's our baby. It's--

00:13:45,764 --> 00:13:47,194
80% of a watermelon is
better than 100% of a grape.

00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:49,884
Mark, you said, "5% of something
is better than 0% of nothing"

00:13:49,884 --> 00:13:50,964
in the past.

00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:52,884
You know what I'm gonna do?

00:13:52,884 --> 00:13:54,834
I'm gonna meet you halfway.

00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,914
The $55,000 for 15%.

00:13:58,914 --> 00:14:02,114
Halfway between
the 12% and the 17%.

00:14:05,964 --> 00:14:07,044
J.T.?

00:14:07,044 --> 00:14:08,194
Let's go.

00:14:08,194 --> 00:14:10,084
Barbara,
welcome to the family.

00:14:10,084 --> 00:14:11,134
(Jim laughs)
Thank you.

00:14:11,134 --> 00:14:12,934
Come on over here.
Come bring it in.

00:14:12,934 --> 00:14:14,734
Baby, I'm coming.
Have you ever had
a lobster sandwich?

00:14:14,734 --> 00:14:17,084
I'm coming!
(Robert) WHOA!
It's a family show, guys!

00:14:17,084 --> 00:14:18,734

Why is it, uh,
doing so well?

00:19:08,984 --> 00:19:12,894

Issued?
Yes.

What's your cost
per freaker?

00:19:22,664 --> 00:19:24,884
Right about a dollar,
little under a dollar.

00:19:24,884 --> 00:19:25,964

$8 to $10.

Mm-hmm.

00:19:42,744 --> 00:19:44,034

00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:47,984
Now let's talk about

00:19:47,984 --> 00:19:50,014
what your business
is really worth.

00:19:50,014 --> 00:19:53,744
Let's say you're gonna do
$320,000 in the last--

00:19:53,744 --> 00:19:55,664
Just over 11 months,
you said, right?

00:19:55,664 --> 00:19:57,794
Uh, yeah.
So let's annualize that.

00:19:57,794 --> 00:19:59,814
You're making about 15%
to the bottom line

00:19:59,814 --> 00:20:01,994
before you pay tax--
Approximately.

00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:03,744
Uh-huh.

00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,694
You're worth somewhere between
350,000 and 400,000 bucks.

00:20:05,694 --> 00:20:06,784
That's it.

00:20:06,784 --> 00:20:07,864
Okay.

00:20:07,864 --> 00:20:10,044
So I think I need 50%.

00:20:10,044 --> 00:20:13,734
That would be
a reasonable valuation.

00:20:13,734 --> 00:20:14,894
Yeah.
What do you say to that?

00:20:17,834 --> 00:20:20,064
Um, I'd probably make some beeps
at ya and... (chuckles)

00:20:20,064 --> 00:20:22,044
(all laugh)

00:20:22,044 --> 00:20:23,864
Well, I'm just saying,
while we're beeping...

00:20:23,864 --> 00:20:25,594
Yeah. Yeah.

00:20:25,594 --> 00:20:28,014
Um, I-I wouldn't--I wouldn't
entertain it seriously.

00:20:28,014 --> 00:20:30,714
Okay, Zach, baby.

00:20:30,714 --> 00:20:31,784
Beep-Beep-Beep.

00:20:31,784 --> 00:20:32,894

00:20:34,914 --> 00:20:37,034
Okay.

00:20:37,034 --> 00:20:39,984
Another cool thing
that we didn't touch on,

00:20:39,984 --> 00:20:42,614
on the video,
there was a box truck

00:20:42,614 --> 00:20:43,914
that we turned into a house

00:20:43,914 --> 00:20:46,694
and we drove around the country,
throwing grilled cheese parties.

00:20:46,694 --> 00:20:47,894
It's one of
our forms of marketing.

00:20:47,894 --> 00:20:49,664
But isn't that kind of
the challenge, right?

00:20:49,664 --> 00:20:50,744
I-I think it's cool.

00:20:50,744 --> 00:20:51,834

00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,864
You guys can set up at--
Huh? Not festivals.

00:20:53,864 --> 00:20:55,664
You don't go to festivals at all
and set up?

00:20:55,664 --> 00:20:56,944
Not right now. I don't really
like festivals, no.

00:20:56,944 --> 00:20:58,684
Okay--
You don't like festivals?
(chuckles)

00:20:58,684 --> 00:20:59,764
No.

00:20:59,764 --> 00:21:00,984
(Barbara laughs)

00:21:00,984 --> 00:21:02,044
No.
(Robert laughs)

00:21:02,044 --> 00:21:03,994
You seem perfect
for festivals.

00:21:03,994 --> 00:21:06,844
I seem that way. I'm not--
I'm not much of a festival guy.

00:21:06,844 --> 00:21:08,594
Really?
No.

00:21:08,594 --> 00:21:09,784
What do you do
in your off time?

00:21:09,784 --> 00:21:12,744
I get up early, usually go to
the river, walk dogs.

00:21:12,744 --> 00:21:15,994
Let me tell you. How you valued
the company, it's nutsy.

00:21:17,814 --> 00:21:19,664
On that basis alone,

00:21:19,664 --> 00:21:21,844
although I love you,
I'm out.

00:21:23,014 --> 00:21:24,714
Okay.

00:21:24,714 --> 00:21:25,794
I love you, too, Barbara.

00:21:25,794 --> 00:21:27,064
I love you, too.

00:21:27,064 --> 00:21:30,814
I get the entire brand.

00:21:30,814 --> 00:21:32,594
Yeah.

00:21:32,594 --> 00:21:34,684
But there's no beeping way...

00:21:34,684 --> 00:21:35,994
(laughs)

00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:38,814
You're worth $2 million today.

00:21:38,814 --> 00:21:39,894
Well, uh, there obviously--

00:21:39,894 --> 00:21:41,644
I feel like there must be
some, like,

00:21:41,644 --> 00:21:44,914
missing on your guys' part
of where I'm at

00:21:44,914 --> 00:21:47,984
if you're not getting
even close to that.

00:21:49,764 --> 00:21:51,014
Look, I like you, Zach...
Yeah.

00:21:51,014 --> 00:21:52,934
But, you know, it's--It's--
It's--It's hard.

00:21:52,934 --> 00:21:54,644
I-I can promise you,
you'd be into it.

00:21:54,644 --> 00:21:56,964
I-I could say in six months,
you're gonna be like...

00:21:56,964 --> 00:21:58,634
(high-Pitched voice)
man, what was I thinking?
Oh, Zach, you know what?
I gotta be honest with you.

00:21:58,634 --> 00:22:00,064
When I'm not up here,
I'm dressed like you

00:22:00,064 --> 00:22:01,694
and hanging out
and dancing everywhere.

00:22:01,694 --> 00:22:02,834
We could have some, like,
umbrella drinks

00:22:02,834 --> 00:22:04,664
and we'd kick it back...

00:22:04,664 --> 00:22:06,034
(laughs)
Holler at some girls?

00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:07,964
I'm out.

00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,044
All right, Robert.

00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:16,614
So, Zach, uh, you know,

00:22:16,614 --> 00:22:19,934
I have to be passionate
about everything I invest in...

00:22:19,934 --> 00:22:21,664
Yeah.

00:22:21,664 --> 00:22:23,714
And I'm just not feeling
that way about this.

00:22:23,714 --> 00:22:24,794
I'm out.

00:22:27,594 --> 00:22:30,944
Okay. All right, you got
some words of wisdom?

00:22:30,944 --> 00:22:33,664
You know, the reality is,
your margin's great.

00:22:33,664 --> 00:22:36,864
The opportunity for branding
and putting a mavs logo

00:22:36,864 --> 00:22:37,944
or whatever logo,

00:22:37,944 --> 00:22:40,594
the incremental cost
is probably minimal.

00:22:40,594 --> 00:22:42,884
So there's some
unique opportunities there.

00:22:42,884 --> 00:22:45,884
But if I had to listen to,
"beep-Beep-Beep! Hey, Mark.

00:22:45,884 --> 00:22:46,964
Beep-Beep-Beep-Beep!
What's up?"

00:22:46,964 --> 00:22:48,044
(trills)
"beep-Beep-Beep!"

00:22:48,044 --> 00:22:49,964
I'd shoot myself. I'm out.

00:22:52,644 --> 00:22:55,714
Now we need to hear the beeping
of you backing up.

00:22:55,714 --> 00:22:56,794
Boop, boop, boop,
boop, boop.

00:22:56,794 --> 00:22:57,914
Beep! Beep!

00:22:57,914 --> 00:22:59,034
All right. Love you, guys.

00:22:59,034 --> 00:23:00,884
Boom-Boom-Boom-Boom-Boom.

00:23:00,884 --> 00:23:02,594
Boom-Boom-Boom-Boom.

00:23:06,044 --> 00:23:07,934
Mark, I thought you were in
for sure at the end.

00:23:07,934 --> 00:23:09,594
Hell, no!

00:23:09,594 --> 00:23:10,984
I-I love his technique. I'm-a do
that at my next meeting.

00:23:10,984 --> 00:23:12,034
(trills)

00:23:12,034 --> 00:23:14,694
what it was like
in the Shark Tank?

00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:15,784
It was like,

00:23:15,784 --> 00:23:17,014
beep, beep, beep, beep.

00:23:17,014 --> 00:23:19,044
Beep!

00:23:19,044 --> 00:23:20,964
Ah! (laughs)

Next in are Tania Patruno

00:23:35,094 --> 00:23:38,294
and NFL running back
Brandon Jacobs.

00:23:46,934 --> 00:23:49,094
Hi. My name is
Tania Patruno...

00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,244
and I'm 2-Time super Bowl
champion Brandon Jacobs.

00:23:51,244 --> 00:23:54,134
And my company is PRO-NRG.

00:23:54,134 --> 00:23:56,214
I'm here seeking $250,000

00:23:56,214 --> 00:23:58,944
in exchange for 15% equity.

00:23:58,944 --> 00:24:03,094
PRO-NRG is a unique
protein-Infused flavored water.

00:24:03,094 --> 00:24:05,084
It's all-Natural
and great-Tasting,

00:24:05,084 --> 00:24:08,164
with no fat, no caffeine,
and no sugar.

00:24:08,164 --> 00:24:10,264
In just one 4-Ounce bottle,

00:24:10,264 --> 00:24:12,214
there are 15 Grams
of whey protein,

00:24:12,214 --> 00:24:14,984
essential vitamins,
and an energy blend.

00:24:14,984 --> 00:24:17,144
It's balanced no matter
how active your lives are.

00:24:17,144 --> 00:24:19,934
I didn't get to where I am
by playing a half a game.

00:24:19,934 --> 00:24:21,234
I got to where I am
by playing a whole game

00:24:21,234 --> 00:24:23,884
at a very, very high level,

00:24:23,884 --> 00:24:26,044
and PRO-NRG has done that
for me.

00:24:26,044 --> 00:24:29,144
I was overweight,
and like many people,

00:24:29,144 --> 00:24:31,064
I bought in to all
the products and gimmicks

00:24:31,064 --> 00:24:33,014
that claimed
to melt the weight off.

00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:35,884
The truth is, I was frustrated
with the results,

00:24:35,884 --> 00:24:37,944
so I set out to create
my own answer

00:24:37,944 --> 00:24:39,994
and I brought it down
to the basics--

00:24:39,994 --> 00:24:42,264
Rehydrate, replenish,
refresh.

00:24:42,264 --> 00:24:43,944
I hustled my way
through doors

00:24:43,944 --> 00:24:46,214
and I got PRO-NRG
into over 3,000 stores

00:24:46,214 --> 00:24:47,264
in the New York area.

00:24:47,264 --> 00:24:49,194
Wow.
Wow.

00:24:49,194 --> 00:24:52,164
Sharks, I need your investments
to fill my purchase orders

00:24:52,164 --> 00:24:54,994
and propel PRO-NRG
onto the national market.

00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:56,214
I'd like for you each
to have a try

00:24:56,214 --> 00:25:00,144
so you can really experience
what PRO-NRG will do for you.

00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:10,164
(groans) Oh.

00:25:11,994 --> 00:25:14,234
Wow. What...

00:25:14,234 --> 00:25:15,934
why does it taste so bad?

00:25:17,294 --> 00:25:19,234
Taste so bad?
Yeah.

00:25:19,234 --> 00:25:21,244
It tastes chemical-y.

00:25:21,244 --> 00:25:23,014
I don't think it's bad
at all.

00:25:23,014 --> 00:25:25,134
You ever taste
protein products?
No.

00:25:25,134 --> 00:25:27,264
That's--there it is.
That's the difference, yeah.

00:25:27,264 --> 00:25:29,884
Believe me, this is something
that tastes right.

00:25:29,884 --> 00:25:32,994
Tania, what am I actually
buying here?

00:25:32,994 --> 00:25:35,314
Do I get a boost?
Am I trying to get jacked up?

00:25:35,314 --> 00:25:36,894
Or am I trying
to lose weight?

00:25:36,894 --> 00:25:38,214
It's the only one
of its kind.

00:25:38,214 --> 00:25:42,134
PRO-NRG simplifies
what your body needs.

00:25:42,134 --> 00:25:45,234
Is this like a gatorade
or like a red Bull?
No.

00:25:45,234 --> 00:25:47,034
It's not either one--
Either one of those.

00:25:47,034 --> 00:25:48,184
Is it a weight loss product?

00:25:48,184 --> 00:25:49,864
These guys have never
been in a gym,

00:25:49,864 --> 00:25:51,144
so they--they don't quite
understand.

00:25:51,144 --> 00:25:53,294
This is a complement
to a workout.

00:25:53,294 --> 00:25:54,884
You wanna rehydrate

00:25:54,884 --> 00:25:57,984
and you also want protein
to rebuild your muscles.

00:25:57,984 --> 00:25:59,864
But, mark, shouldn't pro-"nurg"
Tell me that?

00:25:59,864 --> 00:26:00,984
It's pro-"energy."

00:26:00,984 --> 00:26:02,994
Pro-"n.R.G." (chuckles)
"n.R.G."

00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:04,844
Okay. Whatever.
It's actually a great name.

00:26:04,844 --> 00:26:06,194
Pro-"nurg"?

00:26:06,194 --> 00:26:08,264
no, PRO-NRG.
Listen,
it's all fun and games

00:26:08,264 --> 00:26:10,844
till Brandon comes over there
and crack your head open.

00:26:10,844 --> 00:26:11,934
Nah, I'm--I'm not--I'm not
really... (speaks indistinctly)
he's not gonna...

00:26:11,934 --> 00:26:12,984
then I will give you
the money--

00:26:12,984 --> 00:26:14,264
I will give you
the money for that!

00:26:14,264 --> 00:26:16,044
Oh, really?
Yeah, baby.

00:26:16,044 --> 00:26:17,864
(sharks laugh)

00:26:17,864 --> 00:26:18,994
put the ring on, too,
when you do it.

00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,064
(chuckles) okay.

00:26:21,064 --> 00:26:22,944
Brandon, you're obviously
a businessman.

00:26:22,944 --> 00:26:26,114
So why do you guys need
the capital?

00:26:26,114 --> 00:26:28,094
To get a 2-Time
super bowl champion

00:26:28,094 --> 00:26:29,214
as part of my team--

00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:30,884
You know,
I brought Brandon on,

00:26:30,884 --> 00:26:32,934
but I'm not looking for him
to be an investor.

00:26:32,934 --> 00:26:34,844
You guys are business--
Businessmen.

00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:35,984
Why--Why isn't he
an investor?

00:26:35,984 --> 00:26:38,114
Because I am an endorser.

00:26:40,064 --> 00:26:41,864
Who do you play for?

00:26:41,864 --> 00:26:43,234
San Francisco 49ers.

00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:44,334
And what position
do you play?

00:26:44,334 --> 00:26:46,044
Running back.

00:26:46,044 --> 00:26:47,134
Played the last seven years with

00:26:47,134 --> 00:26:49,214
the 2-Time super Bowl champion
New York giants.

00:26:49,214 --> 00:26:51,184
I don't know if you had it
when you were with the giants.

00:26:51,184 --> 00:26:54,034
Are--Are you gonna have it
in the niners' locker room?

00:26:54,034 --> 00:26:57,084
We had it with the giants
throughout the playoff run,

00:26:57,084 --> 00:27:00,094
then we went to indianapolis
to play in the super bowl.

00:27:00,094 --> 00:27:01,944
Those guys--they loved it.

00:27:01,944 --> 00:27:03,884
Guys were sharing.
Like, the--the bottles,

00:27:03,884 --> 00:27:05,334
you drink half and another guy
drink half of that.

00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:07,194
Like, it--It--It was crazy.

00:27:07,194 --> 00:27:09,894
You guys had a big ol' comeback,
right? The second half?

00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:11,084
Yeah.
Was that the difference?

00:27:11,084 --> 00:27:14,234
So I couldn't tell if that
was the reason why...

00:27:14,234 --> 00:27:15,334
no, I know. I know.
I know. I know.
We went and won.

00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:17,264
But they loved it.

00:27:17,264 --> 00:27:18,844
I like that.
You're not giving us the B.S.,

00:27:18,844 --> 00:27:20,094
but you believe in it.
I like that.

00:27:21,184 --> 00:27:23,884
Tell us about the economics
of the business--

00:27:23,884 --> 00:27:26,194
what you're sales are, how
business is going in general.

00:27:26,194 --> 00:27:28,264
I have invested $75,000.

00:27:28,264 --> 00:27:31,044
It cost me $1.10 to make
per bottle,

00:27:31,044 --> 00:27:33,214
But those costs will be
significantly dropped

00:27:33,214 --> 00:27:35,334
once I reach certain benchmarks
in quantity.

00:27:35,334 --> 00:27:37,164
What do you sell it
to the wholesaler for?

00:27:37,164 --> 00:27:39,164
$1.80.

00:27:39,164 --> 00:27:42,034
Ugh. I hate it.

00:27:42,034 --> 00:27:45,034
So you're making 70 cents margin
but still, it's not horrible.

00:27:45,034 --> 00:27:46,164
And what does it retail for?

00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,264
$3.99.

00:27:49,094 --> 00:27:51,264
Well, good margin for them,
bad margin for you.

00:27:51,264 --> 00:27:54,064
Tania, you realize
that your distributors are

00:27:54,064 --> 00:27:55,994
making more money than you?

00:27:57,234 --> 00:27:58,314
Well...

00:27:58,314 --> 00:27:59,894
that's upside down.

00:27:59,894 --> 00:28:01,284
That's what life is like
in hell.

00:28:03,164 --> 00:28:06,134
You have to make more money
than they do. That's crazy.

00:28:06,134 --> 00:28:08,144
You gotta pay your dues
in whatever business you're in.

00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:09,234
You're not worried about it

00:28:09,234 --> 00:28:10,314
because you're not on
the P&amp;l side.

00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:11,984
You're taking it off the top.

00:28:11,984 --> 00:28:14,134
I as an investor would be very
concerned about those margins.

00:28:14,134 --> 00:28:16,014
That's how
I get my money back.

00:28:16,014 --> 00:28:17,194
In what kind of retailers?

00:28:17,194 --> 00:28:19,194
We're in
all the delis and markets

00:28:19,194 --> 00:28:20,864
that flooded in manhattan,

00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,244
and also big box retailers.

00:28:22,244 --> 00:28:23,944
You told us
you're in 3,000 stores

00:28:23,944 --> 00:28:25,934
how much have you sold
in the last year?

00:28:25,934 --> 00:28:27,144
Okay, we've been in the--
um, on the market

00:28:27,144 --> 00:28:28,864
for just about
three months now.

00:28:28,864 --> 00:28:31,244
We've done $126,000
in sales.

00:28:31,244 --> 00:28:33,194
$120,000 in sales
in 3 months?
Yes.

00:28:33,194 --> 00:28:35,884
I'm surprised, Tania, you--You
haven't been slaughtered yet.

00:28:38,144 --> 00:28:39,914
Somehow you've survived.
Maybe the right partnerships.

00:28:39,914 --> 00:28:42,864
I don't know. But you are not
worth $1.7 million

00:28:42,864 --> 00:28:46,244
under any scenario. You've got
way too much to prove.

00:28:46,244 --> 00:28:48,334
Good luck to you,
but I'm out.

00:28:48,334 --> 00:28:50,214
Yep.

00:28:50,214 --> 00:28:51,934
Here's what I see.

00:28:51,934 --> 00:28:53,914
You've got a great idea,
great product.

00:28:53,914 --> 00:28:57,084
You've got a great angle because
you got Brandon and New York.

00:28:57,084 --> 00:28:59,034
Now he's gonna go out
to san Francisco.

00:28:59,034 --> 00:29:00,284
That's not the challenge.

00:29:00,284 --> 00:29:03,164
The challenge is never the first
act. It's like the nfl.

00:29:03,164 --> 00:29:04,964
The nfl stands for
"not for long"

00:29:04,964 --> 00:29:06,264
for a lot of people.

00:29:06,264 --> 00:29:08,084
He's absolutely correct.

00:29:08,084 --> 00:29:10,144
It's the same thing
in your business here.

00:29:10,144 --> 00:29:11,934
The hard part is
the second act.

00:29:11,934 --> 00:29:13,944
After the newness wears off,

00:29:13,944 --> 00:29:16,044
after someone tries
to knock you off

00:29:16,044 --> 00:29:18,294
and comes out with
super PRO-NRG,

00:29:18,294 --> 00:29:21,844
then that's the hard part.

00:29:21,844 --> 00:29:24,044
I hate businesses where
everybody and their brother

00:29:24,044 --> 00:29:25,844
is trying to get in.

00:29:25,844 --> 00:29:28,114
To me, if you're looking
where everybody else is looking,

00:29:28,114 --> 00:29:29,284
you're looking
in the wrong spot.

00:29:29,284 --> 00:29:31,894
I try to go
where people aren't.

00:29:31,894 --> 00:29:33,244
So for that reason,
I have to say I'm out.

00:29:33,244 --> 00:29:35,094
Okay.

00:29:35,094 --> 00:29:39,044
Tania, you've failed to be clear
as to what the product was

00:29:39,044 --> 00:29:41,084
after a lot of conversation.

00:29:41,084 --> 00:29:43,134
Even when I look
at your packaging here,

00:29:43,134 --> 00:29:46,134
it's even confusing
as a stand-Alone.

00:29:46,134 --> 00:29:48,914
And I just wanna
make a note about Brandon.

00:29:48,914 --> 00:29:50,934
I don't think you utilize him
well at all.

00:29:50,934 --> 00:29:53,984
He's great.
The first time he engaged me

00:29:53,984 --> 00:29:56,264
was when he told
his locker room story.

00:29:56,264 --> 00:29:57,964
I'm picturing this pitch
all over,

00:29:57,964 --> 00:30:00,094
and him coming out
and him starting it and saying,

00:30:00,094 --> 00:30:02,314
"I was in my locker room--"

00:30:02,314 --> 00:30:03,884
"and we were losing
the super bowl.

00:30:03,884 --> 00:30:05,094
Then I hit the pro-'Nurg'."

00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:06,214
Yeah. (chuckles)
"Wham!"

00:30:06,214 --> 00:30:07,934
wham! Anything like that!
"We win!"

00:30:07,934 --> 00:30:10,864
PRO-"nurg."
Pro-"energy"!

00:30:10,864 --> 00:30:14,044
but because of the confusion
of your message alone,

00:30:14,044 --> 00:30:16,244
which it you've gotta clean up,
I'm out.

00:30:19,264 --> 00:30:24,994
Tania, you've done
an amazing job.

00:30:24,994 --> 00:30:27,044
I don't think we've ever had
anybody out here

00:30:27,044 --> 00:30:29,244
that's been in business
for the amount of time you have

00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,014
with the distribution
that you have.

00:30:32,014 --> 00:30:33,184
I mean, it's unbelievable.

00:30:33,184 --> 00:30:37,064
You must be the best salesperson
we've ever met.

00:30:37,064 --> 00:30:41,164
But, you know, my concern is,

00:30:41,164 --> 00:30:42,914
besides the cash,

00:30:42,914 --> 00:30:44,994
I think you need somebody
who understands this space.

00:30:44,994 --> 00:30:46,294
For me,
it's an energy drink space.

00:30:46,294 --> 00:30:48,214
It's just not something
I wanna compete in.

00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:51,264
You know, for that reason, um...

00:30:51,264 --> 00:30:53,214
don't say it. (chuckles)

00:30:53,214 --> 00:30:55,894
I'm out.

00:30:55,894 --> 00:30:58,044
(sighs)

00:30:58,044 --> 00:31:00,064
okay.
Yeah.

00:31:00,064 --> 00:31:01,244
Way it is.

00:31:01,244 --> 00:31:03,984
Tania, there are
four sharks out.

00:31:03,984 --> 00:31:06,284
Only one remains--Daymond.

00:31:06,284 --> 00:31:09,244
Okay, Daymond.

00:31:09,244 --> 00:31:11,034
Listen, you know,
my challenges with this,

00:31:11,034 --> 00:31:14,294
I think is what all the sharks
have--Have vocalized.

00:31:14,294 --> 00:31:17,284
Uh, you know,
very high valuation,

00:31:17,284 --> 00:31:20,194
such a-a hard market
to get into.

00:31:20,194 --> 00:31:22,194
But the good side of it
is that, um,

00:31:22,194 --> 00:31:25,264
I just invested in a-a bunch
of crossfits.

00:31:25,264 --> 00:31:26,844
I'm starting to understand

00:31:26,844 --> 00:31:28,294
how much people want
this type of stuff.

00:31:28,294 --> 00:31:30,994
I forbid you to pay
$1.7 million for this.

00:31:30,994 --> 00:31:32,184
I forbid you.

00:31:32,184 --> 00:31:37,244
I'm gonna give you
$250,000 for 30%,

00:31:37,244 --> 00:31:39,984
but that is contingent
on me taking it to

00:31:39,984 --> 00:31:41,314
a protein and supplement
company

00:31:41,314 --> 00:31:43,034
that I have
a partnership with--

00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:44,334
It's called badass--

00:31:44,334 --> 00:31:47,064
And closing a deal
with them.

00:31:47,064 --> 00:31:48,864
And, Brandon,
I need you in the room

00:31:48,864 --> 00:31:51,314
telling that super bowl story,
to help us sell this thing.

00:31:51,314 --> 00:31:53,014
I got you.

00:31:53,014 --> 00:31:55,014
Just in case you hadn't notice,

00:31:55,014 --> 00:31:57,184
shark Daymond has cut
your value in half.

00:32:00,164 --> 00:32:01,244
Mm-hmm.

00:32:01,244 --> 00:32:02,994
I realize that,

00:32:02,994 --> 00:32:06,244
but I need his know-How, how to
navigate through those meetings.

00:32:06,244 --> 00:32:09,064
Is that a "Yes"?

00:32:09,064 --> 00:32:10,284
that's a "Yes," Daymond.
All right!

00:32:10,284 --> 00:32:11,944
Congratulations.

00:32:11,944 --> 00:32:13,114
I hope it's not the energy drink
making me do this.

00:32:13,114 --> 00:32:14,284
(all laugh)

00:32:14,284 --> 00:32:16,034
You jumped up
pretty fast there.
I did. I did.

00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:17,284
All right. Thank you.
All right. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

00:32:17,284 --> 00:32:19,264
(Daymond and Barbara)
Congratulations.
Thank you so much.

00:32:19,264 --> 00:32:20,844
See ya, guys.

00:32:20,844 --> 00:32:23,894
(Kevin) I think you need
to reposition this.

00:32:23,894 --> 00:32:24,994
I don't think anybody
understands what it is.

00:32:24,994 --> 00:32:27,264
Anybody who works out
understands completely.

00:32:27,264 --> 00:32:30,234

00:32:51,794 --> 00:32:53,984
Hi, sharks. I'm Mona Weiss...

00:32:53,984 --> 00:32:55,664
and I'm Scott Shields.

00:32:55,664 --> 00:32:57,944
And our company is Eco Nuts.

00:32:57,944 --> 00:33:00,594
We are here seeking $175,000

00:33:00,594 --> 00:33:02,734
for a 15% stake
in our company.

00:33:02,734 --> 00:33:05,584
Eco Nuts is a line of
eco-friendly cleaning products

00:33:05,584 --> 00:33:07,764
packaged with little
to no plastic.

00:33:07,764 --> 00:33:09,694
Now I know what you're thinking.

00:33:09,694 --> 00:33:11,864
"Oh, it's another
green Cleaning company."

00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:14,844
But Eco Nuts
are totally different.

00:33:14,844 --> 00:33:17,034
Most of our products
are certified organic

00:33:17,034 --> 00:33:18,594
and are based on this.

00:33:18,594 --> 00:33:20,584
This is our secret weapon.

00:33:20,584 --> 00:33:22,584
It's an organic berry
from the himalayas

00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,044
that naturally produces a soap.

00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:26,694
It's called a soapberry,
or soap nut,

00:33:26,694 --> 00:33:28,994
thus our name Eco Nuts.

00:33:28,994 --> 00:33:30,584
You can use these berries
for laundry

00:33:30,584 --> 00:33:31,964
by placing
four to five of 'em...

00:33:31,964 --> 00:33:33,884
place them into the wash bag
like so,

00:33:33,884 --> 00:33:34,964
directly in your machine.

00:33:34,964 --> 00:33:36,634
When it comes in contact
with the water,

00:33:36,634 --> 00:33:38,964
it releases a natural soap
as it gets shaken around,

00:33:38,964 --> 00:33:40,664
which can do your laundry.

00:33:40,664 --> 00:33:44,644
This jar of water is gonna
represent your washing machine.

00:33:44,644 --> 00:33:46,644
I'm gonna place in one.

00:33:53,794 --> 00:33:55,914
It makes soap. Isn't that cool?

00:33:55,914 --> 00:33:57,864
(laughs)
(Mona) You can... (laughs)

00:33:57,864 --> 00:33:59,034
It's still solid.

00:33:59,034 --> 00:34:01,594
Well, it does--You can
reuse these up to ten times.

00:34:01,594 --> 00:34:03,864
(sharks) Ah.

00:34:03,864 --> 00:34:06,634
This box here does
a year's worth of laundry,

00:34:06,634 --> 00:34:10,614
and it replaces ten bottles
of detergent.

00:34:10,614 --> 00:34:12,634
And now is the perfect time
to invest.

00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:15,844
Americans spend over $70 billion
a year on cleaning products,

00:34:15,844 --> 00:34:18,694
and with your help, we can
help take a bite out of it

00:34:18,694 --> 00:34:19,914
and help save the planet.

00:34:19,914 --> 00:34:21,884
What do you say, sharks?
You with us?

00:34:21,884 --> 00:34:25,834
But why is it the perfect time
to invest?

00:34:25,834 --> 00:34:27,994
Well, we were first
to the mainstream market,

00:34:27,994 --> 00:34:30,564
and now, uh,

00:34:30,564 --> 00:34:31,914
we are going to be everywhere.

00:34:34,734 --> 00:34:38,614
We've managed to capture about
90% of the soapberry market

00:34:38,614 --> 00:34:39,834
thus far by branding it--

00:34:39,834 --> 00:34:41,614
(chuckles)
There's a soapberry market?

00:34:41,614 --> 00:34:42,764
There is a soapberry market
out there, believe it or not.
Okay.

00:34:42,764 --> 00:34:44,564
Scott, what percentage?

00:34:44,564 --> 00:34:47,634
Uh, 90%
in less than 3 years.

00:34:47,634 --> 00:34:49,044
(Daymond) How big is
the soapberry market?

00:34:49,044 --> 00:34:50,834
(Kevin) How big is it annually?

00:34:50,834 --> 00:34:53,694
It's--in the U.S., it's right
around about $1 million.

00:34:53,694 --> 00:34:55,814
So you have $900,000
in sales?

00:34:55,814 --> 00:34:56,894
No. I...

00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:59,014
(sharks laugh)

00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:00,634
I walked into that one,
didn't I?

00:35:00,634 --> 00:35:01,894
Let's do the math.
(Mark) OHH!

00:35:01,894 --> 00:35:03,644
All right. Wait.
Hold--Hold on a second.

00:35:03,644 --> 00:35:04,734
Wait. I caught you
with your mouth open. I got it.

00:35:04,734 --> 00:35:05,814
Let's uh--
why don't you put

00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:06,944
one of those soapberries
in your mouth right now?

00:35:06,944 --> 00:35:09,664
Can we--can we just go back

00:35:09,664 --> 00:35:11,744
to Scott's point
of 90% market share?
Yeah. Okay.

00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,944
(Mark) Yeah.
How much does that equate to
in terms of sales?

00:35:13,944 --> 00:35:16,614
90% of market share--
for us, what it equates to is,

00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,634
last year,
we did about $100,000.

00:35:19,634 --> 00:35:22,744
This year, we're already
on track to do over $250,000.

00:35:22,744 --> 00:35:23,984
Can I see a sample?

00:35:23,984 --> 00:35:26,614
Why, yes.
Absolutely.

00:35:26,614 --> 00:35:27,714
Got a tray for you
right here.
I love Mona.

00:35:27,714 --> 00:35:28,994
Mona is a champ.

00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:30,964
Are these the nuts?
Yes.

00:35:30,964 --> 00:35:32,664
(Kevin) Thank you, Mona.

00:35:32,664 --> 00:35:35,014
You're welcome.
Are the two of you married?

00:35:35,014 --> 00:35:37,644
Not yet. We're working on it.
No. We're engaged.

00:35:37,644 --> 00:35:38,894
(Kevin speaks indistinctly)
(mark and Daymond) AW!

00:35:38,894 --> 00:35:40,894
(Robert) congratulations!
We--Oh, don't congratulate me.

00:35:40,894 --> 00:35:43,784
We've been engaged
for five years.

00:35:43,784 --> 00:35:45,644
(all laugh)
Scott, you animal!

00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:46,844
Mona, Mona, let me ask you this.

00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:47,944
Why does a guy stay engaged
for fives years?

00:35:47,944 --> 00:35:49,694
Why would he do that?

00:35:49,694 --> 00:35:51,814
We're not using the investment
money to get married,

00:35:51,814 --> 00:35:53,744
but we need to bring
our business to the next level

00:35:53,744 --> 00:35:54,894
so that we can get married.

00:35:54,894 --> 00:35:55,964
(laughs)

00:35:55,964 --> 00:35:57,584
Let's say this market
takes off.

00:35:57,584 --> 00:35:59,664
You're assuming your brand
Eco Nuts

00:35:59,664 --> 00:36:01,964
will maintain its dominance.

00:36:01,964 --> 00:36:03,634
Oh, first of all,

00:36:03,634 --> 00:36:05,714
we have a proprietary
sterilization process.

00:36:05,714 --> 00:36:08,794
And we came up with this
because while he and I were

00:36:08,794 --> 00:36:11,034
in our living room
Originally sorting berries,

00:36:11,034 --> 00:36:13,994
and we had people who were
helping us out sorting berries,

00:36:13,994 --> 00:36:15,934
we were all getting sick.

00:36:15,934 --> 00:36:19,564
And we--we decided there must be
something going on with these,

00:36:19,564 --> 00:36:21,034
so we sent them off to a lab,

00:36:21,034 --> 00:36:22,814
and we found that they had
stuff on them.

00:36:22,814 --> 00:36:25,764
Stuff on nuts. Imagine that.

00:36:25,764 --> 00:36:27,634
So you had to get your nuts
sterilized?

00:36:27,634 --> 00:36:28,884
So you found that they had
monkey poop on them?
(Scott) Exactly.

00:36:28,884 --> 00:36:30,644
Everybody needs
their nuts sterilized.

00:36:30,644 --> 00:36:32,664
And if you look into--
Basically, if you look into

00:36:32,664 --> 00:36:34,594
trying Different
sterilization practices,

00:36:34,594 --> 00:36:37,564
you'll find it's very difficult
to get one that is for organic.

00:36:37,564 --> 00:36:38,764
I'm gonna ask you
an important question.

00:36:38,764 --> 00:36:39,934
You have 90% of the market.

00:36:39,934 --> 00:36:41,914
You say you've done
about $250,000.

00:36:41,914 --> 00:36:45,634
You're, uh, asking for a little
over $1 million valuation.

00:36:45,634 --> 00:36:47,814
Uh-huh.
Give me the valuation,
why you came up with that.

00:36:47,814 --> 00:36:48,934
It--It's based on the fact that

00:36:48,934 --> 00:36:50,014
every year we've been
in business,

00:36:50,014 --> 00:36:51,964
we have doubled and tripled
our sales.

00:36:51,964 --> 00:36:54,584
We started our company
with $1,000.

00:36:54,584 --> 00:36:57,014
Now we didn't put anymore money
into it for over a year.

00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:59,034
We made $10,000.

00:36:59,034 --> 00:37:01,984
Our next year, we made $40,000.

00:37:01,984 --> 00:37:03,794
Then we saw the business
was going somewhere.

00:37:03,794 --> 00:37:05,014
We put it--
but you're still not making
any money.

00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,794
We've--We've done over $100,000
this year already.

00:37:07,794 --> 00:37:09,944
How did you secure
your customer base?

00:37:09,944 --> 00:37:11,994
Well, I'm a social media ninja.
(laughs)

00:37:11,994 --> 00:37:13,694
Ah.

00:37:13,694 --> 00:37:15,584
We've got more fans on facebook
than you do, Barbara.

00:37:15,584 --> 00:37:16,794
Well, I'm insulted.

00:37:16,794 --> 00:37:17,884
And I'm out.

00:37:17,884 --> 00:37:18,964
(Mark laughs)
There you go, Barbara!

00:37:18,964 --> 00:37:20,644
Oh, don't be out yet!

00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,734
(laughs) I'm only kidding.
(Mark) Barbara?

00:37:23,734 --> 00:37:24,894
(Robert) WHOA!
No, no, no. I'm not.

00:37:24,894 --> 00:37:26,784
Okay.
Look at that.

00:37:26,784 --> 00:37:27,934
(laughs)

00:37:27,934 --> 00:37:29,684
(Kevin) The market is
so small right now.

00:37:29,684 --> 00:37:31,694
And what you've got--Like,
$1 million in sales in the U.S.

00:37:31,694 --> 00:37:32,994
Means a tremendous amount
of education

00:37:32,994 --> 00:37:34,734
that's to occur before
people who do laundry

00:37:34,734 --> 00:37:37,014
are gonna start buying nuts.
It's gonna be a tough haul.

00:37:37,014 --> 00:37:38,594
I'm not saying
it's impossible.

00:37:38,594 --> 00:37:39,844
I'm not saying
you're not the best.

00:37:39,844 --> 00:37:41,914
It's just that
your company today

00:37:41,914 --> 00:37:44,044
is not worth over $1 million.

00:37:44,044 --> 00:37:46,594
It just isn't. You're not making
enough money yet.

00:37:46,594 --> 00:37:48,014
You're not even married yet.

00:37:48,014 --> 00:37:49,764
For $175,000,

00:37:49,764 --> 00:37:53,014
I'd probably have to own
all of this company right now.

00:37:54,734 --> 00:37:56,584
I'm out.

00:38:00,814 --> 00:38:03,794
So you say you're number one
in the market.

00:38:03,794 --> 00:38:05,744
I'm trying to understand it.

00:38:05,744 --> 00:38:06,994
Shouldn't have said that, Scott.

00:38:06,994 --> 00:38:09,634
Right?

00:38:09,634 --> 00:38:12,564
You said that the market is
$1 million...

00:38:12,564 --> 00:38:14,614
it--It's not $1 million.
He messed up.
Domestically.

00:38:14,614 --> 00:38:15,944
How do you not know
the numbers, Scott?

00:38:15,944 --> 00:38:17,964
Right.
Hold on, Robert. Robert.

00:38:17,964 --> 00:38:19,994
You shouldn't be making
these mistakes

00:38:19,994 --> 00:38:21,564
and these assumptions.

00:38:21,564 --> 00:38:22,764
I'm out.

00:38:25,834 --> 00:38:28,584
Who do we have left here?
Robert?

00:38:28,584 --> 00:38:29,814
You gotta know the numbers.

00:38:29,814 --> 00:38:32,764
You can't come out and say,
"I own 90% of the market,"

00:38:32,764 --> 00:38:36,634
and it turns out
you might own 10%, 15%.

00:38:36,634 --> 00:38:39,584
I would like to
get into this business

00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:41,584
because I do think
it's gonna grow.

00:38:41,584 --> 00:38:43,034
At $175,000,

00:38:43,034 --> 00:38:46,614
what possible offer
could I give you

00:38:46,614 --> 00:38:50,944
that's reasonable from
a pure numbers perspective?

00:38:50,944 --> 00:38:55,864
It's--It's not
a $1.2 million business today.

00:38:55,864 --> 00:38:58,614
$175,000

00:38:58,614 --> 00:38:59,794
for... 50%?

00:38:59,794 --> 00:39:01,714
Would you consider that?

00:39:04,944 --> 00:39:07,794
I'd consider it but I wouldn't
take it, unfortunately.

00:39:07,794 --> 00:39:09,594
I mean...

00:39:09,594 --> 00:39:10,844
just from what we've done...
(speaks indistinctly)

00:39:10,844 --> 00:39:12,714
Well, you better be working
16 hours a day on our business,

00:39:12,714 --> 00:39:14,934
like we do.

00:39:14,934 --> 00:39:16,564
Sorry. What did you say?

00:39:19,594 --> 00:39:21,994
♪♪♪

00:39:25,314 --> 00:39:28,514
♪♪♪

00:39:28,514 --> 00:39:30,344
Two sharks are out.

00:39:30,344 --> 00:39:32,634
Mona and Scott have one offer
on the table from Robert--

00:39:32,634 --> 00:39:37,614
$175,000 for a 50% stake.

00:39:37,614 --> 00:39:40,444
But Mona has questioned what
Robert will bring to the table

00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:42,544
for such a high stake
in the business.

00:39:42,544 --> 00:39:43,794
Just from what we've done...
(speaks indistinctly)

00:39:43,794 --> 00:39:45,664
Well, you better be working
16 hours a day on our business,

00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:48,344
like we do.

00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,514
Sorry. What did you say?

00:39:49,514 --> 00:39:50,594
(laughs) I said,
"you better be working

00:39:50,594 --> 00:39:53,364
16 hours a day on our business,
like we do."

00:39:53,364 --> 00:39:54,634
(laughs) For that kind of...
for that kind of money.

00:39:54,634 --> 00:39:56,614
Oh--Oh, no, Mona. I worked
24 hours a day on my business

00:39:56,614 --> 00:39:58,744
so I could have the privilege
of sitting up here

00:39:58,744 --> 00:40:00,564
and listening
to people like you.

00:40:02,684 --> 00:40:03,764
I'm out.

00:40:03,764 --> 00:40:05,784
Okay.
Okay.

00:40:05,784 --> 00:40:08,614
Guys, I'll get right to
the point.

00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:09,744
I think your marketing's
horrible.

00:40:12,644 --> 00:40:16,384
There's nothing that's gonna
demonstrate to me

00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:18,434
that your product is
any different than the others.

00:40:18,434 --> 00:40:20,594
You're using berries
to do your clothes.

00:40:20,594 --> 00:40:22,664
We sterilize ours.
But that's the point.

00:40:22,664 --> 00:40:25,344
You may sterilize them,
but there's nothing there

00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,544
that tells me
that you do that.

00:40:26,544 --> 00:40:29,444
You've completely left out
your greatest differentiation.

00:40:29,444 --> 00:40:30,534
Well, just the branding

00:40:30,534 --> 00:40:31,694
and the look
of the boxes alone--

00:40:31,694 --> 00:40:33,734
When you look at how
traditionally in the marketplace

00:40:33,734 --> 00:40:35,394
where it's sold--
When I look at the boxes,

00:40:35,394 --> 00:40:37,414
I'm gonna know
they're sterilized nuts?

00:40:37,414 --> 00:40:40,544
At our size, advertising out
there in front of everybody...

00:40:40,544 --> 00:40:41,714
"Oh, look.
Here's this, here's that.

00:40:41,714 --> 00:40:43,484
Here's what we do
so differently"...

00:40:43,484 --> 00:40:45,394
until we're actually large
enough to truly have

00:40:45,394 --> 00:40:47,764
our big, big place--
You're giving me excuses.

00:40:47,764 --> 00:40:50,634
Excuses are worthless.
I'm giving you a very solid
and valid reason

00:40:50,634 --> 00:40:53,494
of how we managed to protect
ourselves in the business...
your packaging sucks.

00:40:53,494 --> 00:40:56,444
Run rabid with dogs

00:40:56,444 --> 00:40:58,494
and manage to climb our way up
to be number one.

00:40:58,494 --> 00:41:00,434
Congratulations.
And we will not
be brought down,

00:41:00,434 --> 00:41:01,594
even if another larger company
comes in--
You know what?

00:41:01,594 --> 00:41:02,684
When you're done patting
yourself on the back,

00:41:02,684 --> 00:41:04,464
you should look at
your marketing and say,

00:41:04,464 --> 00:41:07,564
"the message this big board
sends me is not gonna

00:41:07,564 --> 00:41:10,694
educate me on the fact that you
have a differentiated product."

00:41:10,694 --> 00:41:12,714
You've completely
left it out,

00:41:12,714 --> 00:41:15,384
and now you've left me out.
I'm out.

00:41:16,614 --> 00:41:17,714
Okay.

00:41:21,334 --> 00:41:22,734
Hi, sharkette.
Well, let me tell you,

00:41:22,734 --> 00:41:24,334
the best part about
your pitch today

00:41:24,334 --> 00:41:26,684
is you are
such a good couple.

00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:29,464
It only take an hour
to get married.

00:41:29,464 --> 00:41:30,534
Oh, my lord.

00:41:30,534 --> 00:41:32,514
I think the Eco Nuts name
is great,

00:41:32,514 --> 00:41:33,734
but beyond that,

00:41:33,734 --> 00:41:35,644
I don't think you present
the product well at all.

00:41:35,644 --> 00:41:37,634
Not really.

00:41:37,634 --> 00:41:38,714
I'm out.

00:41:38,714 --> 00:41:40,414
Well, thank you.

00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,744
Well, thank you very much
for letting us show everything.

00:41:42,744 --> 00:41:44,594
(Kevin)
Wait. Wait. Wait a minute.

00:41:44,594 --> 00:41:45,734
I also agree with Barbara

00:41:45,734 --> 00:41:48,484
that you did
a genuinely terrible job.

00:41:48,484 --> 00:41:51,394
But she really moved me
with something she said.

00:41:51,394 --> 00:41:53,784
And I haven't done this before
on "Shark Tank,"

00:41:53,784 --> 00:41:55,664
but I'm willing to do it today
because I am Mr. Wonderful.

00:41:55,664 --> 00:41:57,664
Do you want me to
marry you now?

00:41:57,664 --> 00:42:00,364
(all laugh)

00:42:00,364 --> 00:42:02,564
Can you marry us?
Of course I can.
I'm Mr. Wonderful.

00:42:02,564 --> 00:42:04,434
My parents would kill me.

00:42:04,434 --> 00:42:06,434
I'm sorry. Then you leave
with nothing.
Well, get them on the line.

00:42:06,434 --> 00:42:07,494
All right, guys.
Well, good luck.

00:42:07,494 --> 00:42:09,464
(Mark) Good luck, guys.
Bye!

00:42:09,464 --> 00:42:10,544
Scott, marry that woman.

00:42:10,544 --> 00:42:12,314
Ah! (laughs)
I will!

00:42:12,314 --> 00:42:13,784
Let me do it for you now!

00:42:13,784 --> 00:42:15,534
(sharks laugh)

00:42:15,534 --> 00:42:16,614
When Scott said that we had

00:42:16,614 --> 00:42:18,594
a 90% share
of a $1 million market,

00:42:18,594 --> 00:42:21,544
I was thinking,
oh, no. That's not what it is.

00:42:21,544 --> 00:42:23,714
I didn't wanna, like, stop him
right then and there on air

00:42:23,714 --> 00:42:25,394
'cause I didn't want
to embarrass him.

00:42:25,394 --> 00:42:27,534
But, like, you know,
I-I didn't wanna...

00:42:27,534 --> 00:42:30,594
it's okay. I do a great job
embarrassing myself. (laughs)
