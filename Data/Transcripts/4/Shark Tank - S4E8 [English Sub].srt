00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:02,830
(man) the sharks are back,

00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:04,400
in an all-New season
of "Shark tank,"

00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,530
where Hopeful entrepreneurs
from across the country

00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,270
dream of a chance
to secure an investment

00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,070
and gain powerful partners

00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,330
to start, grow,
or save their businesses.

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,430
If the sharks
hear a great idea,

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,370
they're ready to invest
using their own money.

00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,500
It's potentially the best
product we've ever seen.

00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,530
Here's my offer.
I'd like to take

00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,470
the $90,000 you want

00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,170
and add a zero to it.

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,170
Now we're at $900,000.

00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,570
And they'll fight each other
for a piece of the action.

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,370
But first, the entrepreneurs
must convince a shark

00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,370
to invest the full amount
they're asking for...

00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,000
(voice breaking)
I work so hard.

00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,800
Or they'll walk away
with nothing.

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,370
Who will bid the highest?
It doesn't work that way!

00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,030
I haven't seen this before
in the "shark tank."

00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,500
It's sink...

00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,370
(Robert) Wow.
Seth Macfarlane, baby.

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,530
Or swim.

00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,270
None of us are interested
except for Lori.

00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,200
This is such a warm,
inviting place.

00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,470
Who are the sharks?

00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:03,800
They're self-Made millionaire
and billionaire investors

00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,100
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,130
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist

00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:14,030
who turned a $10,000 loan
into a software business

00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:17,830
worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:20,230
Lori Greiner,
the queen of qvc,

00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,030
holds over a hundred patents

00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,230
and has launched
over 300 products,

00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,070
grossing over
a half a billion dollars

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,630
in retail sales.

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,730
Daymond John is a fashion mogul
and branding expert

00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,030
Who grew
his homemade clothing line

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,770
into the globally recognized
fashion brand fubu.

00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,970
Robert herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,

00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,830
is now a technology mogul

00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,770
who sold his first
internet companies

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,270
for over $350 million.

00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,170
And mark cuban,

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,700
notorious billionaire
entrepreneur

00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,570
and the outspoken owner
of the Dallas mavericks.

00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,400
First into the tank
is ginelle mills,

00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,430
who set out to solve
a problem she faced as a mom.

00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,600
♪♪

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,230
Hi. I'm ginelle.

00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,570
I am the owner of cool wazoo.

00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,870
I'm here seeking $65,000

00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,200
in exchange for 25% equity
in my company.

00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,100
When my daughter
was Younger,

00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,100
she was burned
on a park swing.

00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,730
And I looked everywhere
for a product

00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,700
that would protect her
from the heat of the swing,

00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,200
and I couldn't find one.

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,400
So that's when I decided
to create one.

00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,170
This was my diaper bag
at the time.

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,970
It was overstuffed
with all these products.

00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,530
I was carrying around this
bulky shopping cart cover,

00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,230
this restaurant
high chair cover,

00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,000
this car shade,

00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,500
and this way-Too-Small
changing pad.

00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,730
I couldn't fit another
product in this diaper bag.

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,770
I couldn't even fit the diapers,
and it was a diaper bag.

00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,800
And then I had an "Aha!"
moment.

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,730
What if I took
all these products

00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,530
and made them
into one product

00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,830
and incorporated my swing idea
into that same product?

00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,170
Wouldn't that be cool?

00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,000
(laughs)
Well, here it is.

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,830
It's called cool wazoo.

00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,800
This is the first cover

00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,930
with core material
on the inside

00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,700
that redirects that heat
back to its source,

00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,170
and it does five things.

00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,170
It is the swing cover,

00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,170
the restaurant high chair
cover,

00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,530
the shopping cart cover,
and a car shade,

00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,500
and... a changing pad.

00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,670
I'm looking for a shark
who wants to make money

00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:43,470
while making lives easier
and safer

00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,170
for moms and children
everywhere.

00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,730
Who wants to be cool with me?

00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:50,930
Ginelle, 35 years ago,
when I was 5 years old...

00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,630
(laughter)

00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,330
I didn't have any of this crap,
and I somehow survived.

00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,130
Who's buying all this junk?

00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,230
Moms buy this stuff.

00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,100
They're concerned
about the germs,

00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,100
and now, as my daughter was,
I was concerned about the heat.

00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,600
So that's why I meshed
the two together.

00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,430
Why don't you show him
your packaging?

00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,770
(mark) Now, ginelle, there's
other competitors, right?

00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,970
Because I know my wife
has used other products.
(Robert) There is?

00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,000
These are some
of my competitors.

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,270
There's not one product
that does five things.

00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:22,900
When my daughter was burned,
it was 80 degrees outside.

00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,130
What were you doing?

00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,370
Swinging her on the swing.
I put her on.

00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,770
It was 80 degrees--
Wasn't she howling
at the moon?

00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:30,300
No--Well, you put her down.

00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,770
(imitates babbling)
You know?

00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,400
I'm like, "ugh.
Just swing," you know?

00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,030
Just like--
(sharks laughing)

00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,900
I mean, something like that.
I mean... (laughs)

00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,100
You see smoke coming up,
she's on fire.
(Robert) Wow.

00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,130
(speaks indistinctly)
I bought online
one of those laser guns

00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,170
that measure--
You shot her?

00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,700
(laughter)

00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,270
That measures the surface
temperat--

00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,600
I know what you're
talking about.
That measures surface
temperatures, yes.

00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,230
You--You direct it, and it
tells you the temp.
So you're now shooting the seat
with a laser

00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,530
to get the temperature.

00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:58,000
Yes, because I couldn't
believe it was that hot.

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,970
I can't believe you go from
that to buying a laser gun.

00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,030
Yeah, because I felt bad.

00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,730
I had a little bit of luck
back last may.

00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,130
The product
was on the "today" show

00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,900
With Kathie Lee and hoda.

00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,400
And it was on for about
40-Second airtime--

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,900
How many did you sell
from those 40 seconds?

00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,700
Well, I didn't have
any inventory.

00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,500
So, online,
did you take orders

00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,030
even though
you didn't have inventory?

00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:24,030
I'd rolled into production,
the "today" show hit,

00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,200
and when I got
those orders back,

00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,800
85% of those cool wazoos
were wrong.

00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,930
That first run that I did,
85% of it

00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,600
went back to the factory

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,330
because they didn't
really know

00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,370
how to work with
this kind of material.

00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,200
Did they refund your money
when you returned it?

00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,030
They didn't refund the money.

00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,570
(Lori) But how many people
ordered, anyway?

00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:48,830
About $14,000 in sales.

00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,370
What happened after that?

00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,100
Well, I didn't really know
how to capitalize on that.

00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,530
This past december, I was
on the show "the doctors,"

00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,730
and it was
a christmas special.
Wow!

00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,470
The first time,
she wasn't in a position

00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,970
to take advantage of it.

00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,400
I'm sure when you were going
on "the doctors," you said,

00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,830
"I don't want this
to happen again."

00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,300
What happened?
Good point.

00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,530
Well, I was kind of
out of money at that point.

00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:13,970
They wanted to give
everyone in the audience

00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:17,030
250 cool wazoos,

00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,830
so that's where
my inventory went.

00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,330
I basically gave it away.

00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,500
For free?
For free.

00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,600
And what'd you get back
in return?

00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,170
Nothing, because the format
of the show kind of...

00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,570
wow.
Changed a little bit
at the last minute.

00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,970
That's not a great
business decision.

00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,430
(Kevin) You know what?
I know. That's--

00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,200
That was a bad--
You got cool wa-Screwed.

00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,870
What are your sales?

00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,330
In the last 12 months,
my sales have been $20,000,

00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:41,030
but I have had
zero inventory.

00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,800
My efforts right now
have not been on sales,

00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,570
because I'm moving
my production overseas,

00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,800
because it's costing me too much
money to make them here.

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,470
How much is it costing you
to make them here?

00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,630
It's costing me--
Hold your breath.

00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,270
$30 to make one.

00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,270

Shocking.

What about wholesale?

That's why--
I'm not kidding you.

Are you a Charity?
So, Yeah.

From $30 to what if you move
production overseas?

00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,850
Okay, so I've spent
the last year,

00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:46,580
um, really focusing on
not just the cost,

00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,520
but also the quality.
(Robert) How much?

00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,620
$11.36.

00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,750
Nice.

Does your husband own
half the business?

He has funded the business
100%.

00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,350

on it so far?

00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,880
$96,000.

Whoa!

Wow.

Wow.
Well, okay, so, it--

00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,350
How much more pain
can he sustain?

00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,050
(laughs)
(chuckles)
he's very tolerable.

00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,180
I mean, he's--
He is supportive 100%.

00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,350
If you lose another $100,000,
he'd be okay?

00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:23,350
I think if I gave him
a nice smile, he might.

The problem is
it's not a company yet.

the easier part.

I have been working on This

and to source the material.

00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,880

I was frustrated with these,

00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,220

And I will help you
to get the price down

00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,650
and to manufacture
this better.

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,650
Wow, I would have
taken 50%.

00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,850

Lori, did you invest in her
because she cried?

No, it wasn't because
she cried.
This cannot become--

00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,980
It was because she showed
such extreme passion for this.

00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,880
I liked who she was,

00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,950
and I also think
it's a good product, and I--

00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,220
why didn't you get 51%
and get control?

00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,880

all over the map.

taking control of things.

to run out there

00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,150
means everything to myself
and everything to my family.

00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:25,020
Hello, folks.
My name is Bruce Gaither.

00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,620
This is biscuit.

00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,350
And my company
is no fly Cone.

00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:31,980
I'm looking for an investment
of $25,000

00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,050
for a 15% stake in my company.

00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:35,950
Now, you've all heard
the saying,

00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,680
"build a better mousetrap,
and the world

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,250
will beat a path
to your door."

00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,850
Well, I've built
a better flytrap.

00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:44,680
No fly Cone is a nontoxic,
Cone-Shaped flytrap

00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,320
that catches them on the inside
so you don't have to see them.

00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,750
The Cone is placed over
a natural attractant,

00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,920
provided by biscuit.

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,080
Nothing works better.

00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,580
It's a simple solution.

00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,020
You take your flytrap,
your no fly Cone,

00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:03,080
and you set it...
over a scooper.

00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:07,520
Come back later, and you
see how well it works.

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,920
(Robert) EW!
(Lori laughs)

00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,280
Now, the reason I came up
with This

00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,350
is because my office
is the barn,

00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,680
which is haunted with flies

00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,380
because of the dogs
and the horses.

00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,180
So, I designed
an all-Natural flytrap,

00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,820
and right away,
we were successful,

00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,150
catching them where they
feed and breed.

00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:26,950
With your investment
and your connections,

00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:29,880
we can make no fly Cone
the trusted standard

00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,380
for controlling flies
in no time.

00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,950
What questions do you have
for me?

00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,350
How is that different
than, like,

00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,180
a no-Pest strip
that you would hang?

00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,580
Well, the strips
have an external glue.

00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,520
Well, you see the flies
that they accumulate.

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,080
With this,
you don't see the flies

00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,020
until you actually look
to see what you've caught.

00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,920
It requires dog excrement
as the attractant.

00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,950
(Robert) Is that True?
Yes, sir.

00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,780
(daymond) So, the dog
has to defecate outside,

00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,950
and you put the cap over this,
and that attracts the flies.

00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,220
But if you clean up the dog's
mess and put it away...

00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,420
You got it, daymond.

00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,780
You--You're kind of
creating the problem

00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,920
by leaving the poop outside,
aren't you?

00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,780
When you pick up
your dog poop,

00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,350
there's gonna be residue
on the grass,

00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,050
and there's residue
in your scooper.

00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,820
Does this attract other things
besides flies?

00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,480
People catch mosquitoes
with it,

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,050
people catch gnats with it.

00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:20,680
Um, there's a lot of different
uses for the trap.
Wh--

00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,050
Lot of different applications.

00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,750
Seth Macfarlane, baby.
Hey, you guys doing
a tv show?

00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,580

How are you?

00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,650

This is, uh,

00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,550
Welcome, Seth.
How's it going?

00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,080

theatre business.

00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,350
Didn't do so well.

00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,850
Oh, stewie, come on, man!
(laughter)

00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:44,550

00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,220
Love that show.
(normal voice)
Thank you very much.

00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,120
Seth, you look like you're
18 years old, for god sake.

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,520
You are so--Oh, god,
now I love it here.

walking by.

00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,480
(chuckles)
So, what brings you?

00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,150
Uh, Bruce is
a friend of mine.

00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,320
I actually take horseback
Riding lessons from Bruce.

00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,580
And, you know, he--He showed me
how this thing works,

00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,480
and, you know,
it's not just flies.

00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,380
It's small children...
(laughter)

00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,380
Uh, bad feelings.

00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,520
It just--It attracts them all.
It's great. Yeah.

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,720
Seth saw me develop the trap.

00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,020
Well, Bruce, you have
a very big fly right here

00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,320
who can help you
with this situation.

00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,820
(Lori laughs)
Why--Why do you need us?

00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,220

I'm not allowed to do

00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,820

If I ever write
a really funny cartoon,

00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,020
I'm gonna hand it
to Seth and say, "here."

00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,750
But right now I have, like,
five amazing people

00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,880
in front of me
that can help me

00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,450
get this on the market.

00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:33,420
What are your sales
for the last year?

00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,180
Only 3,000 traps.

00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,180
Seth, uh, where do you live?

00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,680
I-I don't like flies
in my house.

00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,280
Do you use this
in your house?
What's my address?

00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,580
I'm not gonna tell you
where I live.
(laughter)

00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,850
But do you use these
in your house?

00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,680
Yeah, I-I don't have a dog.

00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,880
He's your spokesman,
and he doesn't even have a dog?

00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:52,450
If I did, I'd be
the first guy in line.

00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:55,880
What I'm not relating to is,
is that I have to have...

00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,280
dog excrement
to make it work.

00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,150

selling this.

Bruce, I don't have
any connections

00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:31,750
in this side of the world,
so I-I don't think

00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,620
I'm the guy to help you,
so I'm out.

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,580

landmark. I wouldn't never s--

00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,280
thank you, mark.

this already.
No--

So, Bruce,
two sharks are out.

00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,480
Was it a good idea
to bring Seth or not?
(laughs)

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,980
Well, I'll tell you,
it was a lot more fun

00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,650
than being out here
by myself, so Yeah.
Yeah. (laughs)

00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,480
Hey, you know, I'll tell you,
the only reason I'm not out yet

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,480
is because you brought Seth.

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,850
Ugh. I, uh... (sighs)

00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:58,080

help you even with Seth.

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,920
I'm out.

00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,520
Well, I'm not gonna hold
Seth against you.

00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,280
This is a--such a warm,
inviting place.

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,650

00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,620
(Lori) I commend you
for coming up with something.

00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,550
You had a problem,
you created a solution,

00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,080
and that's great.

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,220
The problem for me is,
is I can't get past

00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,750
how it works.
It's a personal turn-off.

00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,080
I--if it had another
type of attractant,

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,980
then it might be
more appealing.

00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,720
Well, let's go
for chicken bones.
Chicken bones. (laughs)

00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,220
I'm sorry. I'm out.

(Robert) I got to be honest
with you, Bruce.

00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:38,080

a lot of value.

I-I blame myself.
No, no.

00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,320
You probably should.
This was my fault.

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,680
Yeah, Seth, we're all
blaming you.
You probably should, Seth.

00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,520
This was my fault.
This was a terrible idea.

00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,720
What a disaster.
No, it was wonderful.

00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,920
Not really.
Thanks for coming out.

Thank you very much.

00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,880
It was actually a good idea.

just kind of made its way

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,180
into his mouth, and--

Like the bad guy from
"raiders of the lost ark,"

00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,350
and he didn't do anything.

00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,720
He just sat there,
kept talking.

I don't know if it went
down his throat or what.

does he need this thing,

is an inconvenient mess.

00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,730
Platetopper transforms
your plates at home

00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:27,030
into airtight
Food storage containers.

00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,700
Here's how it works.

00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,200
Simply grab the handle
and press down.

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,930
And the airtight Seal
is so strong...
(Kevin) Oh.

00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:36,070
You can suspend a plate
in midair.

00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,570
It works on circular plates,

00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:41,030
grandma's favorite China,
even your kitchen counter.

00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:43,200
To release the Seal,
lift the pull tab,

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,930
and your food is ready
to serve.

00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,870
Platetopper
is microwave-Safe,

00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:50,200
to prevent messy splattering
and to keep food warm.

00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,200
And cleanup is a breeze,

00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,200
because platetopper
is dishwasher-safe.

00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,530
And watch this.
You can finally organize

00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:58,000
your kitchen cabinets
at home,

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,430
because platetoppers
nest neatly

00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,800
for efficient storage.

00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,030
But wait. There's more.

00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,430
(laughter)

00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,800
Sharks, if you invest
right now,

00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,930
I'll throw in Three
New Sizes absolutely free.

00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:12,170
(Lori laughs)

00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,770
The platetopper mini...
(Kevin) Wow.

00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:14,830
The platetopper tall...

00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:15,900
(Kevin) Ooh.
(daymond) ahh!

00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,600
And the famous cake topper.

00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,270
Ahh!
Wow!

00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,830
Sharks, I need your help

00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,530
to fill
massive purchase orders

00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:26,230
from two of the world's
largest retailers.

00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,830
Join me,
and let's make platetopper

00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:31,430
into a household brand
right now.

00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,070
Sharks, here are
the platetoppers.

00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,900
Thanks, Michael.
Absolutely.

00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,430
Lori.
Thank you.

00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,770
Wow!
Kevin.

00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,730
Isn't that amazing?

00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:45,900
Comes off so easy.

00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:49,000
(Lori) So what are these
major retailers that you're in?

00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,830
You might as well jump
right to that.

00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:53,930
Uh, the product has been
on qvc since March,

00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,530
and it's still on,

00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:58,670
and on walmart's Web site
since may.

00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,870
So no actual retailers
in the store?

00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:03,800
This has been just only
on web sites?
Correct.

00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,370
This is such a good idea.
Thank you.

00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,200
It's by far the most elegant way
to cover food,

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,700
as opposed to covering it
with a disposable...

00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,700
(Kevin) Oh, I hate that.
I'm always ripping it.
Trash product.

00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,200
Mike, you--
(Robert) Michael, how did you
come up with it?

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,070
I came up with the product
over seven years ago

00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:17,770
when I was at home from college
over holiday break.

00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:20,200
I was doing a lot of work
in the kitchen

00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,870
and just envisioned
a suction plate dome.

00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:27,030
And eventually I combined that
with a microwave plate cover

00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,670
and created the platetopper
you see today.

00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,930
So you had
no engineering background

00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,730
or product background?

00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,500
Well, I did just come up
with the idea randomly,

00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,700
but I studied electrical
engineering in college

00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,070
at princeton university.

00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,300
Oh. A princeton guy.
And then I went on
to study

00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,100
biomedical engineering,
and last year I graduated

00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,230
from medical school
from U.C.S.F.

00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:48,100
And, Mr. Wonderful, feel free
to call me Dr. Platetopper.

00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,370
(sharks laugh)
Are you a doctor, Michael?

00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:52,730
I'm a doctor on paper.

00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:54,530
I'm not a practicing physician
right now,

00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,200
because I've taken
the last year off

00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,430
to completely dedicate myself
to launching

00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,970
the platetopper product line.

00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:01,270
I see there's a patent there.

00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,630
Yes. There's
a utility patent here.

00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,530
Under your best case scenario,
in the next 12 months,

00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:06,830
how much can you sell?

00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,670
So right now, uh,
purchase orders

00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,900
Have totaled over $1 million.

00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:14,170
That's over four months.

00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:18,630
Of that, I get paid wholesale
$500,000.

00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,800
Michael,
I like what you're doing.
Okay.

00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,630
And I think what you need
is a financier.

00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:27,300
Absolutely.
Because, you know,
when I talk about

00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,800
owning 5% equity
in a business,

00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,200
I don't even get up
in the morning for that.

00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,300
It's irrelevant.
Mm-hmm. Right.

00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,600
So I'm not interested
in your equity,

00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,070
but I am interested in you.

00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,570
I'm gonna reverse your deal.

00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:38,530
I'm gonna say, you want
$90,000? You've got it.
Okay.

00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,070
Pay me a 5% royalty.

00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,700
And you keep 100%
of what you own

00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,070
for the big score
when you sell this

00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,270
to a major player one day.

00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,230
I totally love this product.

00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:51,030
I'll even get on qvc and say
it's great on my chicken.

00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:53,300
So, Mike--
Okay. Well, thank you,
Mr. Wonderful.

00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,670
Thank you for that offer.
It is an offer on the table,

00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,900
and I will consider it
as I listen to other offers.
Excellent.

00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,670
Great answer.
What I love about you
is you're very, very smart.

00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:03,030
Um, you know, you're slick.

00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,770
Also, I think
a little obnoxious.

00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:06,330
Wait, there's more.
You're a little greedy,

00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:09,200
and I can't wait
to be your partner.

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,570
What was your strategy
coming here

00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:12,130
offering us 5% for $90,000?

00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,270
I mean, you know, obviously,
that's--That's crap, right?

00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,930
I know th--I--

00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:19,070
the relatively low portion
of the equity

00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,500
is because I want to retain
as much of the company

00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,000
as possible, obviously.

00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,230
All roads lead to Mr. Wonderful
in that scenario.

00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:27,730
How many did you sell
your first time on qvc?

00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,100
How many units?

00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,100
It was 6,080 single units.

00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,570
But what I'd--
what I'd like to say is

00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,800
on qvc, they did
an initial test run

00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,070
with $60,000 worth of retail.
(daymond) Mm-hmm.

00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,730
A few months later,
they ordered

00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,230
$1 million worth
of retail goods.

00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:44,970
So... the same possibility
exists with walmart.

00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,800
So I think we've established
this guy's the real deal, right?

00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,300
(Lori) Here's my offer.
I'd like to take

00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,500
the $90,000

00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,900
and add a zero to it.

00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:59,700
Yes. (exhales deeply)

00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,700
So now we're at $900,000--
Offer.
Yes.

00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,430
Ooh.
(daymond) All right.

00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:09,230
♪♪

00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:18,630
I'd like to take the $90,000

00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,530
and add a zero to it.

00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:24,200
Lori has offered Michael
10 times more money

00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,500
than he asked for.

00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,900
So now we're at $900,000--
Offer.
Yes.

00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,770
(Robert) Ooh.
(daymond) All right.

00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,470
For 30%.

00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:35,430
I would like us to do
our own infomercial rollout.
Mm-hmm.

00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,700
And I have all the connections

00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,400
to all of the top retailers
around the world.

00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,230
Michael, she's giving you
a $3 million valuation,

00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,000
all right?
That is a phenomenal offer,

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,670
but what I'm curious is--

00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:48,700
I know it's going to take
more than $900,000.

00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,000
What is the financing like
on the back end?

00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,100
As it's working,
I'll keep funding.

00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,900
(daymond) Here's why
Lori's not necessarily

00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,300
the right partner for you,
because you already are on qvc.

00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,200
We're not even talking about
getting on qvc, daymond.
If you didn't have that...

00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,700
Mm-Hmm.
Then I can see that she's
giving you something else

00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,970
that we may not be able
to do...
Yeah.

00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:06,770
Because she has an immediate--
Turn the switch.

00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:07,900
Mm-hmm.
But... you're there.

00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,470
(Lori) That's all fine,
daymond,

00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:12,470
but he has an offer
on the table right now...
I know it.

00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:13,870
From me for $900,000.
And he has a second one

00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:16,430
for $1 million for 25%, Lori.
Pardon me?

00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:18,500
Oh. Silence.
Well--

00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:22,100
He has a second offer
for $1 million for 25%.

00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,500
Bang!

00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,370
(Lori) But he doesn't have...

00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:27,300
okay.
Any of the connections
or the pipeline

00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,330
or the factories
or all the things...

00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:31,100
Mm-Hmm.
That I'm offering you.

00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,630
What is she--
What is she talking about?
And I've offered you more,

00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:35,030
because I said we'd start
with $900,000.

00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,800
I offered $1 million.

00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,630
You know, I started
exactly like you.

00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:44,130
I'm just you 17 years later
with all those connections.

00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:47,200
I think you know I'm
the right partner for you...

00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,100
Mm-Hmm.
Because I know how to do
exactly what you want to do.

00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,930
Bull crap. You know,
Lori's great at what she does,

00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:55,430
but she thinks she's great at
everything every one of us does.

00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:58,270
Um...
(laughs) Don't listen
to the little noise over there.

00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,630
(Kevin) Let's just look
at these two offers--

00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:01,030
$900,000 for 30%.
Right.

00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,530
$1 million for 25%.

00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:05,370
But of them, you understand,
steals your equity.

00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:06,800
Okay.

00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,670
Because This is gonna be
worth a fortune one day,

00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:11,430
and you gave up.
Michael, are you seriously
considering Kevin's offer?

00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:13,630
Kevin, right now, based on
these excellent offers

00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:16,270
on the table, I'm gonna
respectfully decline your offer.

00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,670
(Robert) Thank you.
You want to give up equity?

00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:19,170
Bam!
Shut up, Kevin.

00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,400
So right now I just want to
get to the valuation.

00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,300
I do have a valuation in mind
that's, uh,

00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,770
a little bit different than
the one I stated initially.

00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:32,470
My product--
It's gone from $60,000

00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:35,800
to $1 million in retail sales
in a few months.

00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,830
And it's been proven
on qvc--

00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:41,270
Yes, but there's 4,000 other
products that went to zero.

00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,500
I'm just saying,
there's obviously utility

00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,870
for every single household
in America

00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,370
that has circular plates.

00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:49,470
But I'll tell you one--
Let him finish.
Let him finish.

00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,970
I'm saying
that my valuation--

00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:53,000
I want it to reflect
the potential.

00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,030
Are you gonna put
a number out there, Mike?

00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:57,300
Yeah, but, Mike, because--
Michael, you were gonna get
to a number, weren't you?

00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:00,330
I-I'm saying these other
products grow

00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,870
to $100 million products.
Okay. Guys--

00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,330
(Robert) No, but, Michael,
you must have a number in mind.

00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:05,730
What's your number?
I'm getting irritated.

00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,700
It's a little slippery to me,
the way you're acting.
S--

00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,070
'cause, listen,
you got a number, man.

00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,370
Yeah.
Let's not play games.

00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,070
Daymond,
I'm--I'm honestly not

00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:15,530
trying to be slick or Sly--
Just get to the number, man.
Say it then.

00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:17,070
I'm not trying to be
slick or Sly.

00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:19,370
I'm just letting everybody
field their offer before--

00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,970
Okay, you have one offer
for $900,000.
Before I--

00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,470
just say the number, man.

00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:24,170
If I were
a used car salesman,

00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:26,300
I wouldn't say,
"here's the lowest I'll go."

00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:29,200
I would negotiate.
Michael, I don't disagree
with your strategy.

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,730
I'm not being--
I'm not trying to be negative.

00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:35,130
If I know one thing,
it's to say less

00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,900
than it is to say more.

00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,630
So I am not gonna disclose
what my magic number is.

00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,330
All right, Mike,
you know what?

00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:43,670
You're starting to rub me
the wrong way. I'm out.

00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:46,530
(Robert) WHOA!
Whoa!

00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:49,130
It's a slick Willie thing.
You know, dancing around--

00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:50,800
"Well, maybe. Hold on.
I'm say--"
So, daym--

00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,670
I-I'm out. You don't need
to speak to me anymore.

00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:56,400
I--
(Kevin) Well,
that's interesting, Mike.

00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,130
So I'll speak
to Mr. Wonderful,

00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:01,570
and may--And daymond
might overhear me.

00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:03,770
So I really appreciated
daymond's offer

00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:05,900
of $1 million for 25%.

00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,770
Listen.
My gut Feeling is saying

00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:10,470
This would not be a great
partnership for you and I.
Hmm.

00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,600
Because I practice business
another way, all right?
Okay.

00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,370
So I should shut up,
because I'm not in this anymore.

00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:18,000
Uh, so--Uh, daymond, I'm--

00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,900
(Kevin) Y-You know why you're
running into trouble here?

00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,470
You came with a valuation
of $1.8 million.
Yeah.

00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:25,230
And then you're not
honoring it anymore.
(Robert) he's negotiating.

00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:27,800
I-I'm field--
I'm fielding these offers.

00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,370
(Kevin) You have
three sharks left.

00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:31,670
You have reduced
your probability of success

00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:33,630
by at least two out of five.

00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:35,230
You better get focused
on the other sharks

00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,470
that are still in the deal.

00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:38,570
I want to hear
from the other sharks.

00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:39,970
And, Lori, I--
your offer's great,

00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:42,070
so we're gonna talk about it.
You know,

00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:44,070
I'm gonna step back.

00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,900
Are you taking your offer
off the table, Lori?

00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,870
I'm curious just to say,
what if I rolled it back?

00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:56,230
What if I went back
to the $90,000

00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,830
for the 5%
as you walked in?

00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:00,700
Seems to me like you're
more comfortable with that.

00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,770
So, Michael, let me tell you
what's happening now.

00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:04,570
You had an offer.
(laughing)

00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:06,270
No, it's nothing
to laugh about, my friend.
Okay.

00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,230
You're losing offers.
You're losing money.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,730
You're losing!

00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,900
When are you gonna shut up
and take an offer?

00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,500
(Robert) Here's where I'm at.

00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:19,370
For me, the risk is
the product doesn't sell.

00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:20,900
(snaps fingers)
$1 million gone.

00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,570
(snaps fingers)
$500,000 gone.

00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:25,470
All of a sudden,
you're into negative cash.

00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,030
That's my worry.

00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:33,170
Are you gonna make
an offer, Robert?

00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:34,730
Michael,

00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:37,770
I-I can't help you
with the retail part.

00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:39,330
Okay.
Um...

00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:41,400
uh, so, in terms--
Before you--before--

00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,500
I'm out.

00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,870
You do realize you haven't
even given

00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:50,730
the remaining two sharks
your valuation yet?

00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:52,970
I mean, at this point, you gotta
stop playing the games.

00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:54,530
What is the number?

00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,830
I-I'm simply waiting for
offers to be on the table.

00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:59,270
All right. I'm gonna go
to the bathroom, man...
if you keep waiting...

00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,530
or something, you know?
They keep getting smaller.

00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:01,770
That's what's actually
happening here.

00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:03,470
You only have two sharks left.
I'm gonna--

00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:05,070
I'll give--I'll put out--
I'll throw out a number.

00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,730
You guys have pushed me.
Okay.

00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:09,000
Um, I'll--I'll describe
the offer

00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,830
that I was originally
going to make,

00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:14,000
which was $750,000

00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,700
in exchange for 5%
of the company.

00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,670
Here we go with this crap.

00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:21,630
And that's a valuation
of $15 million.

00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:25,430
Wait a minute.
You asked for $90,000 for 5%.

00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:28,300
Now you've changed it
to $750,000?

00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,170
I haven't changed it.
I've said that was

00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,430
what I was originally gonna
come into the tank with.

00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:35,970
Why did you come in
with $90,000 for 5%?

00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:37,300
Switch and bait.

00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,300
Why are you doing that? Why?
I'm not--

00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,100
We actually may watch a guy
with a fantastic business

00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,830
walk out of here
with nothing pretty soon.

00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,770
Potentially the best product
we've ever seen.

00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:48,730
♪♪

00:34:56,650 --> 00:35:00,920
Wow. We actually may watch a guy
with a fantastic business

00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,750
walk out of here
with nothing pretty soon.

00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:05,220
Potentially the best product
we've ever seen.

00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,820
(mark) Let me ask
a simple question.

00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:09,620
What is the value to you
for a line of credit

00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,620
in the event
your projections are met?

00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:14,350
(sighs and clicks tongue)

00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:17,250
I would need to call--
Can I call my person?

00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,620
Sure. Let him make
his phone call.
Really?

00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,050
Yes. Yeah.
Time is money.

00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:22,520
Go ahead. Just make it quick.

00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,520
(exhales deeply)

00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,020
guys, you wanna deal
with this guy every day?
No. I wouldn't
deal with this guy.

00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:34,150
He went from $90,000 for 5%
to $750,000 for 5%.

00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:36,580
You're telling me
he's accurate?
Well, I don't know
if he's accurate,

00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,580
but there's definitely
something there.
(cell phone chimes)

00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,920
(man) Hey, Mike.
Can you talk to
one of your c.E.O.S?

00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,380
Can you pull them
into your office right now

00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,850
to help me with this
sort of valuation?

00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:46,880
Sure, Yeah. One second.

00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,020
He's playing a ridiculous game.

00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,680
No, he's just precise.

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,980
It's definitely something there,
but don't lie.

00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,650
I mean, this is when
he's in his best behavior.

00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,180
Imagine when he's a partner.

00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,920
They're essentially saying,
"look, you're gonna need

00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,250
"money in the future
in order to finance,

00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:01,180
uh, purchase orders."
Mm-hmm.

00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:04,350
What if they were to give me
a $10 million line of credit?

00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:06,850
Essentially, how much equity
would I give them in return?

00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:09,080
He came in and made
a strategic decision

00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,980
that he would give up
a small portion of equity

00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,380
for a small amount of money

00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,780
in order to get
the relationship.

00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,120
I throw guys like this
out of my office.

00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,620
I throw them out
of the window.

00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,780
Like, this is just ridiculous.

00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,450
This is--
This is ridiculous.

00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,150
(under breath) okay.

00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,820
Okay, Michael, what's happened
here in the "shark tank"

00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,220
is rather remarkable.

00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:39,120
You had a $900,000 offer
for 30%.

00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,180
That evaporated down
to $90,000 for 5%.

00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,080
So you talked your way
out of that one Nicely.

00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,580
Daymond offered you
$1 million,

00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:49,080
and it went to zero, because you
meandered around here

00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,450
like a shark that has
no direction.

00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:53,120
So I think,
at the end of the day,

00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,250
if you keep working this hard,
you'll leave with nothing.

00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:58,750
I was gonna offer him
$1 million, too,

00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,020
and he talked himself
out of that.
(Kevin) wow.

00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,850
I think you better get focused,

00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:05,320
because now you have
two sharks left.

00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,580
Mr. Cuban hasn't spoken
what he wants to do.
Right.

00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,680
Lori has actually diminished
her offer dramatically

00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,120
'cause she got tired
of listening to you.
(laughs) That's not why.

00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,580
I think it's True.

00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,080
You went back and talked
to somebody.

00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,820
What are you coming back
to tell us?

00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,680
Uh, so I went and talked
to my Younger brother

00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,180
and got his c.E.O.
To speak to me

00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:25,480
about the value of, uh,
a line of credit.

00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,980
$10 million is a number
that we discussed.

00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,950
But what amount of cash
do you want today

00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,450
for what percentage?

00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,020
M-more what I want is
based on the valuation.

00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,580
So the--
so you'll take $90,000--

00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,020
What's the--
Let him talk.
Let him talk. Let him talk.

00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,120
The valuation is $15 million.

00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:44,150
So $1.5 million for 10%
of the company, for example.

00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:46,780
Okay. There's what you really
wanted to come in

00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,220
and ask for today.
Okay.

00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:50,050
I just want to make sure
you guys are clear.

00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:52,320
He wants
a $15 million valuation.

00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,180
Okay, I'm out again.

00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:57,280
(mark) It took a lot of work
to get you to that valuation.

00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,380
$15 million, even with knowing
that there's a floor

00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,950
of $1 million
in purchase orders,

00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:06,580
is too high
for a consumer goods product.
Okay.

00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,920
So for that reason,
I'm out.

00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,380
Uh, is there--
Whoa. Wow.

00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,850
Wait, wait.
So what's the value

00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:12,580
that you have in mind
for the company right now?

00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,820
Nowhere near $15 million,
because--
I know.

00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,550
I'm happy to hear
what it is, though.
(Robert) Michael.

00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:18,350
It doesn't matter, Michael.
I don't want--
Michael, he's out.

00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:21,180
Lori's still in.

00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,920
I'm--I'm still--

00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,150
Michael, what I tried to do--
I'm still willing
to negotiate.

00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:27,050
I understand, Michael,
but we did negotiate.

00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:29,280
I gave you
the benefit of the doubt,

00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,880
and we went through
a whole dance,

00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,320
a whole negotiation.
Right.

00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,780
And with that still,
you came to $15 million.

00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:37,520
We were talking about details
that, to me,

00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,480
are--Are very important
for structuring the deal,

00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,320
but we weren't talking numbers,
and I--

00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,350
But the most important detail
now is he's out.

00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,880
So talk to Lori.

00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,450
I was just--
I was just waiting--

00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:49,980
I thought you were gonna
make an offer,

00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,250
and I was just biding time.
And you were wrong, Michael.

00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:54,650
You were wrong.

00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:57,480
You're best to talk to Lori.
So, the--
mark, the one thing

00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,080
I have for you is that the--
You're best to talk
to Lori, man.

00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,080
There are 15--
Michael, what are you doing?

00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,820
(indistinct arguing)
the guy said he was out.

00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,120
(daymond) You have one last
person to talk to. Please.

00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,680
You have--You have done
a remarkable thing.

00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,480
You have convinced everybody
to rescind their offer

00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,650
because you can't seem
to make a decision.

00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,820
I do seem to be
the only one left here.

00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:18,350
So you have your moment now
to convince me

00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:21,480
why I should stay with you,
when you didn't realize that...
Mm-hmm. Right.

00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,580
I was the right one for you.

00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,450
My initial Strategy was simply
to field all the offers,

00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:29,650
and I think because we got so
caught up in those discussions,

00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:31,180
that I wasn't able to ask you
all the questions

00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,650
that I wanted to originally.

00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:34,420
Michael, what are you
doing with Lori's offer?

00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,950
So what I'm asking
from you is,

00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,680
in an "as seen on tv"
Campaign,

00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,920
it requires buying
Inventory

00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,350
before Those purchase orders
are in place.

00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:42,880
No, actually, it doesn't.

00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,880
But that's why I was
the right partner,

00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,720
because I told you I know
all about what you need.

00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:55,720
But still, the valuation...
I'm not pleased with.

00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:00,620
Well, if we went back to
your original $90,000 for 5%...

00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:04,020
Mm-Hmm?
What if I were to give you
$90,000 for 10%?

00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,650
All of it's here for you.

00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:08,380
It's all here.
Mm-hmm.

00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,720
Perfectly.
Like, tied up in a bow.

00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,980
I just tuned out
for a little bit because--

00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,680
You tuned out?!

00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,380
(daymond) He tuned you out,
Lori, for a little bit.
(laughs)

00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,250
I just thought--I mean,
you're obviously the shark

00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,620
and trying to take advantage
of the situation--

00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,080
(daymond) No, you're not.
No, I'm not trying
to take advantage.

00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,250
He just said
he tuned you out.
That's--No--

00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,920
Not in a--
not in a disrespectful way.
Well, you--

00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,380
Just a breather--
Yeah, take a breath.

00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,980
Take a breath.
Ask yourself--
Michael, how do you say

00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,180
something like that
respectfully?

00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,550
I--
Ask yourself--
How is it going

00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:33,680
in the "shark tank"
for you right now?
(laughs)

00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,680
How's it going, Buddy?

00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,120
Uh, far more intense
than I anticipated.

00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,980
(Robert) Michael, you've played
this game for a long time now.

00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,580
You know, you've been
disrespectful to Lori.

00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:47,150
She's made you an offer.
What are you going to do?

00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:51,650
Uh, I'd like to make
a counteroffer.

00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:54,050
Why don't you talk to her?

00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,620
All right. Absolutely.

00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,850
Okay.
Lori, So, uh,

00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:00,150
I would like to sign
an agreement

00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:02,120
for a 5% equity stake.

00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,080
So, if any of the sharks
would like to re-Enter

00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,620
and make
a simple cash offer

00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:09,350
for a 5% equity stake
so we can be--

00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:12,050
the $90,000 at 5%?
So--No. I-I'm saying,

00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:14,750
who will bid the highest?
(scoffs)

00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:16,420
Michael, it doesn't work
that way!

00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,680
(daymond) You are
playing games.
It doesn't work that way!

00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,750
None of us are interested
except for Lori.

00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:22,320
Are you gonna take
her offer or not?

00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,450
Michael, I'm giving you
a lifeline

00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:28,350
for the next--Literally--
Two seconds.

00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:30,420
This is the last thing
I'm gonna offer you.

00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,780
$90,000, 8%.

00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,420
Take it or leave it.

00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:38,150
(exhales deeply)

00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:44,720
(exhales deeply)

00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,380
time to make a decision,
Michael.

00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,350
(clears throat)

00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:56,320
(Lori) You should know
in your gut.

00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,750
I-I'll do it.
You got a deal.

00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:59,020
You got a deal.
All right. Good.

00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,350
Wow.
Yeah, finally!

00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:04,320
(all speaking at once)

00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,680
Thank you. I'm really--

00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,280
I am really happy
to have a deal done.

00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,150
All right, good.
Good to hear.

00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:11,550
Congratulations, Michael.
All right. Michael.
Thanks, guys. Thank you.

00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,580
Thank you.
Bye.

00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,320
I got a deal.

00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,820
(groans)

00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,020
I'm shocked
you stayed in it.

00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,720
You know, I like
the product, guys.

00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,350
I can't stand him.

00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:28,280
Platetopper bozo.
(Lori) I did what I wanted
to do.

00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,550
It's a good product.
(singsongy)
I'm gonna make it a hero!
