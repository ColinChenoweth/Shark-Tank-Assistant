00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,550
(man) The sharks are back,

00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:03,820
in an all-new season
of "Shark Tank,"

00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,870
where hopeful entrepreneurs
from across the country

00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,650
dream of a chance
to secure an investment

00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,570
and gain powerful partners

00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,870
to start, grow,
or save their businesses.

00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,930
I'm not trying to make friends.
I'm trying to make money.

00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,550
We can dramatically
increase profit.

00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,700
If the sharks
hear a great idea,

00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,550
they're ready to invest

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,800
using their own money.
They're so greedy.

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,580
And they'll fight each other
for a piece of the action.

00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,700
I feel this Barbara crap.

00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,970
I've worked with him.
He's miserable.

00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,920
You're a vicious granny.
I'm not vicious at all.

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,550
But first, the entrepreneurs
must convince a shark

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,830
to invest the full amount
they're asking for,

00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,800
or they'll walk away
with nothing.

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,930
I don't think
you have a clue

00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,700
about what you're going to do
to run your business.

00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,020
You have no business concept.

00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,620
It's sink...
you're getting your ass
kicked in here.

00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,680
Or swim.
Any side effect?

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,550
Diarrhea.
Ooh!

00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:55,880
Ha!
You guys don't make it easy,
do you?

00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,980
Welcome to the "Shark Tank."

generation of costumes.

Oh, lord.
Are they people?

(whirring)

00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,020

Ooh!

00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,370
Hello, sharks.
My name is Drew Beaumier.

00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,270
My product is drive suits,

00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,020
and I'm requesting $150,000

00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,330
for 20% equity stake
in my company.

00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,420
Drive suits are
the first generation

00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,320
of wearable
recreational devices

00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,270
and are unlike any other
product available

00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,030
on the market today.

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,120
Their main attraction
is the function

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,470
to instantaneously
transform the user

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,470
from a human or walking state

00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,330
to a vehicular
or motor-driven form.

00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,200
(laughs)
Crazy.

00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,350
Whether I'm
at a national convention

00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,170
or simply testing a prototype
out on the street,

00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,470
everyone stops,
and the first thing

00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:06,380
they always ask me is,
"where can I get one?"

00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,050
This leads me to believe

00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,070
that the highest financial
payoff for my invention

00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,370
exists in mass manufacturing
and distribution.

00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,380
With your much-needed
investment

00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,030
and equally needed and respected
business expertise,

00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,150
I see absolutely no reason
why together

00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,330
we can't mark a new standard
in children's entertainment

00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,120
and create a product
that literally

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,350
drives off the shelves.

00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:28,350
(whirring)

00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:31,280
That's cool.
(laughs)

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,180
Thank you very much.

00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,300
How fast does it go?

00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,420
It goes about 10, uh,
maybe 12 miles an hour.

00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,470
Drew, can I see it? Can I--
absolutely.

00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,000
(Barbara) Drew, how did you
come up with the idea?

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,450
Um, just basically I needed
to make my rent money,

00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,180
and I just kind of had
this idea.

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,400
I saw a flier
for a costume contest.

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,320
And I saw a chance to, like,
definitely make my money back,

00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,400
my investment back,
even if it was just

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,400
selling the costume
after I created it.

00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,130
Can I ask you a question?
I'm sorry.
Absolutely.

00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,030
So... I get you put it on.
Mm-Hmm.

00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,220
Then how do you go?

00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,020
It's a hand switch.
(whirs)

00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,180
OHH!

00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,270
(laughs)

00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,450
Oh, that's cool.
And it's--

00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,370
I know it's mechanical
and technological-Looking,

00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,000
but honestly, all it is
is a positive/negative wire

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,250
to a battery with a switch.

00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,450
Is that insurable?

00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,220
I actually think these
are safer

00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,250
than most, uh, like,
standing apparatuses.

00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,420
Because you're so close
to the ground,

00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,170
you can't fall, yeah.

00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:22,250
How big is the box
that you ship this in?

00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,180
I have not, uh, yet
begun selling them.

00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,270
♪♪♪

00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,450
I was pretty much advised
to not sell

00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:33,080
until I had everything
covered with patenting.

00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,420
What do you want
the $150,000 for?

00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,220
I believe that's
the minimal amount

00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,380
I would need to bring
my product to the next level,

00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,480
which is basically having
an autocad drawing,

00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,320
all patents, and getting
a manufacturer's request.

00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,150
Tell us about what it takes
to build one--

00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:50,150
You know, what the pieces are,
and then also go into

00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,170
the patents you're trying
to put together.

00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,480
They're basically made out
of currently successful

00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,230
children's products and toys.

00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,400
Have you been to toy fair yet?
I haven't.

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,000
I-I mostly work in, like,
costume contests

00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,130
And, uh, performances
and appearances.

00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,330
In the past two years,
we've won about five contests

00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:08,200
and I made about $25,000
in cash and prizes.

00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,430
But, Drew, isn't it time,
at this point,

00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,000
to partner with
one of the big toy companies,

00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,030
because so much of the challenge
you face is manufacturing,

00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,150
which they have nailed down,

00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,470
and more importantly,
distribution?

00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,320
What you're wearing
could probably be dumbed down

00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,400
to a $99 price point,
I would hope,

00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,220
and perhaps packaged in a way

00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,080
that would fit on the shelves
of walmart.

00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,350
If you had... a partner.

00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,170
(Robert) But what's proprietary
about it, Kevin?

00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,000
Like, he goes
to a toy company.

00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,280
Wh-What's unique?
What can't they copy?

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,170
Basically, what I have to
bring to the table for them

00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,300
is just the trial and error
over the past two years.

00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,220
These are definitely not
the first prototypes.

00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,100
So it's your experience?
Yes.

00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,220
The best thing I have in place

00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,380
is I have the trademark
for drive suits.

00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,150
I have not been able
to afford a patent.

00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,420
I had a provisional patent,
which expired,

00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,100
but I didn't see it doing
much good.

00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,380
Whoa. Don't like that.

00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,470
You know what?

00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,470
These guys are wasting time.

00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,080
I call these guys hammerheads,
'cause they think

00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,330
that everything that
walks in the door is a nail,

00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,200
and they just try
to pound 'em.

00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,330
Because it works, Mark,
that's why.
You--It doesn't work.

00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,300
You guys--You guys aren't
about--look.

00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,400
You guys aren't about
a product yet. So you've got--
what are they about?

00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,080
You guys have gone

00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,030
and you've won all this money
at costume parties.

00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,380
Tell me how much money
you've made,

00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,230
what you've been
hired to do.

00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,020
My daily rate is usually--
for a costume,

00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,270
for an 8-hour day, is I usually
charge $300 or $400.

00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,400
That's it?
Oh, my gosh.
That's...

00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,080
that's nothing.
Way too low.

00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,370
Wha-What is it you want?

00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,050
You want to be a circus
performer, or you want to sell

00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,480
500,000 units
through the toy chains?

00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,280
That's what I would
like to do.

00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,120
Like I said, I'd much rather
mass manufacture them and--

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,320
Okay, so you need
a partner to do that.

00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,020
Absolutely.

00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,230
So why wouldn't you
take this to a toy company,

00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,450
partner with them?

00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,050
They're currently paying
between 5% and 7% in royalties.

00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,330
You'd make some money,
my friend.
Sir.

00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,200
(Mark) what they're really
gonna say is,

00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,400
"It's not quite ready.

00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,420
"We're not gonna pay you
7% of anything right now,

00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,130
"because there's nothing
to pay.

00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,330
"We're not gonna pay you
an upfront fee.

00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,170
"and, oh, by the way,
even if we like it,

00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,280
we're gonna take six months
to put together a contract,"

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,180
and meanwhile you're
sitting around doing nothing.

00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,030
So, Mark, you want to send
this guy into a destiny

00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,180
of being a circus performer?

00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,120
(Robert)
Here--Here's my challenge.

00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,000
You want to manufacture these.

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,250
As we've decided,
this is one of the rare times

00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,000
I think unless you have
a patent

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,070
or some proprietary
technology,

00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,030
you're gonna be in trouble.

00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,300
I'm out.

00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,000
Thank you.

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,020
So, Drew, it's just

We'll also hire
an engineer

00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,180
to help you optimize
the design of this.

00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,270
We'll see where we can take it
in terms of cost.

00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:33,050
Then we'll make some
business decisions.

00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,470
Because the key here,
you have to understand--

00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,120
You're not a company yet.

00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,050
(Daymond) So, Cuban wants you
to work for him

00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,030

for about three years...

Until maybe there's, uh...

00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,130

00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,280
No, that's not--
That's so far from the truth.

00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,130
As an elephant in a circus.

00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:49,230
You might get a feed bag.

00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,480
No. That's so far from
the truth, and you know it.

00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,080

there's some uncertainty

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,270
and we'll learn as we go

00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,220

business decisions as we go,

00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,030

00:15:31,467 --> 00:15:33,217
and it's flawless.

00:15:33,217 --> 00:15:34,337
It's--It's the "Mona Lisa."

00:15:34,337 --> 00:15:36,337
(laughs)
Well, there's one tiny flaw.

00:15:36,337 --> 00:15:38,487
There's a zit.

00:15:38,487 --> 00:15:41,517
It's not a tiny zit.
It's Mount St. Zit.

00:15:41,517 --> 00:15:43,587
Oh, my god,
is that hideous!
I know.

00:15:43,587 --> 00:15:45,467
(laughter)

00:15:45,467 --> 00:15:47,217
All we do is we take
this little tool here--

00:15:47,217 --> 00:15:48,597
It's called the lasso.

00:15:48,597 --> 00:15:51,697
And we're just gonna circle
that sucker right there.

00:15:51,697 --> 00:15:53,437
Hold shift, tap delete...

00:15:53,437 --> 00:15:55,367
okay.
Enter, and voila.

00:15:55,367 --> 00:15:58,247
Your pimple is no more.
Oh, my... yikes.

00:15:58,247 --> 00:15:59,497
(laughter)

00:15:59,497 --> 00:16:02,417
Sharks, we want to get
pc classes online

00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:04,547
into the hands
of every computer

00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,367
and gadget retailer.

00:16:06,367 --> 00:16:10,517
By bundling our service
with their hardware sales,

00:16:10,517 --> 00:16:13,537
we can dramatically
increase both of our profit.

00:16:13,537 --> 00:16:15,697
David, how did you meet Bruce?

00:16:15,697 --> 00:16:18,217
He taught my mother to skype.

00:16:18,217 --> 00:16:20,387
Now I can't get rid of her.
(laughing)

00:16:20,387 --> 00:16:22,517
I turn on the computer,
there she is.

00:16:22,517 --> 00:16:24,387
(laughter)

00:16:24,387 --> 00:16:26,347
Why are you bundling
your sales

00:16:26,347 --> 00:16:27,567
with hardware sales?

00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:29,387
What's your logic
behind that?

00:16:29,387 --> 00:16:32,247
Both of my parents
are therapists,

00:16:32,247 --> 00:16:33,687
and they taught me
a very interesting

00:16:33,687 --> 00:16:36,467
basic rule in psychology,

00:16:36,467 --> 00:16:39,487
that if you can touch it,
it's real.

00:16:39,487 --> 00:16:40,667
So instead of just saying,

00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,337
"Hey, why don't you
buy these classes?",

00:16:42,337 --> 00:16:44,247
by putting it
in their hands,

00:16:44,247 --> 00:16:46,437
they can touch it.
It makes it real.

00:16:46,437 --> 00:16:48,597
We sell our service
for $199 a year.

00:16:48,597 --> 00:16:52,497
And through the retailer,
we sell it to them at $99.

00:16:52,497 --> 00:16:54,517
They're getting 100% markup.

00:16:54,517 --> 00:16:55,637
So you don't want a bundle.

00:16:55,637 --> 00:16:57,667
You want it to be sold
as an add-On?
Yes.

00:16:57,667 --> 00:17:00,437
You don't even know
what you want.

00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:02,247
You don't even understand
the difference

00:17:02,247 --> 00:17:03,637
between a bundle
and an add-on.

00:17:03,637 --> 00:17:06,637
A bundle is when you
put together two products

00:17:06,637 --> 00:17:08,387
or services for one price.

00:17:08,387 --> 00:17:11,587
An add-on is something
you add to in a sale

00:17:11,587 --> 00:17:13,467
afterwards for more money.

00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:15,667
You don't even get that.
You're a bozo.

00:17:19,567 --> 00:17:21,337
Do you have any sales?

00:17:21,337 --> 00:17:22,637
We've only been in existence
for six months,

00:17:22,637 --> 00:17:25,267
but we have about
115 members.

00:17:25,267 --> 00:17:27,537
How much did it come to
in revenue?

00:17:27,537 --> 00:17:29,517
We're currently, uh,
right around thirty--

00:17:29,517 --> 00:17:31,687
$35,000.

00:17:31,687 --> 00:17:34,597
(sighs)
Let's say I go
to a large manufacturer

00:17:34,597 --> 00:17:38,447
and I say, "bundle this
into a million laptops."

00:17:38,447 --> 00:17:39,587
Mm-hmm.

00:17:39,587 --> 00:17:42,447
You don't have the capacity
to service them.

00:17:42,447 --> 00:17:44,287
You'd blow up in two seconds.

00:17:44,287 --> 00:17:45,697
If it was that many,

00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:47,647
we would have to expand
rapidly.

00:17:47,647 --> 00:17:51,397
You think? (laughs)
(laughs)

00:17:51,397 --> 00:17:54,337
We do not pay our teachers,

00:17:54,337 --> 00:17:55,637
because what we offer them

00:17:55,637 --> 00:17:58,647
is at the end of teaching
a class, the teacher can say,

00:17:58,647 --> 00:18:00,517
"if you'd like to do
a private lesson,

00:18:00,517 --> 00:18:02,267
here's how you can
sign up for it."

00:18:02,267 --> 00:18:04,697
You need slave grunts
that work for free initially,

00:18:04,697 --> 00:18:07,667
and then you hope that some
percentage of those individuals

00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:10,297
end up getting
a direct relationship

00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,447
with your customers,
and you get a piece of it?

00:18:12,447 --> 00:18:14,547
We get 30%.

00:18:14,547 --> 00:18:18,287
You are valuing this business
at $1 million.

00:18:19,587 --> 00:18:23,217
Okay. So, is there anything else
that you can tell me

00:18:23,217 --> 00:18:25,217
that's gonna give me
the "Aha!" moment

00:18:25,217 --> 00:18:26,467
that it's worth
a million dollars?

00:18:26,467 --> 00:18:29,447
What it comes down to
is passion.

00:18:31,247 --> 00:18:33,267
Mmm.
Ha!

00:18:33,267 --> 00:18:34,387
Oh, no, no, no. I--
that's such a huge--

00:18:34,387 --> 00:18:36,217
You're the only person
that has passion.

00:18:36,217 --> 00:18:38,217
That's such a differentiator.
I want to hear this one!

00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,397
Thank god we finally found
somebody with passion.

00:18:41,547 --> 00:18:43,287
(Mark)
I got to tell you, David.

00:18:43,287 --> 00:18:44,617
I used to write for
"Computer reseller news,"

00:18:44,617 --> 00:18:46,347
so I'm very familiar...

00:18:46,347 --> 00:18:49,287
I love the idea
of classes online...

00:18:50,437 --> 00:18:51,687
in 1985.

00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:57,537
It's been done again
and again and again.

00:18:57,537 --> 00:19:01,417
And to come in as
your differentiation being

00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:05,547
50 years old, yet you haven't
said a single, solitary word

00:19:05,547 --> 00:19:07,497
about what you're going to do

00:19:07,497 --> 00:19:11,217
to identify
50-plus-year-old consumers,

00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:13,497
and you've got bundling
confused

00:19:13,497 --> 00:19:15,467
with up-sell at retailers.

00:19:15,467 --> 00:19:18,387
I don't think you have
a single, solitary clue

00:19:18,387 --> 00:19:20,517
about what you're going to do
to run your business.

00:19:22,497 --> 00:19:24,337
Now you may think
I'm gonna go out

00:19:24,337 --> 00:19:25,617
after saying all that...

00:19:28,217 --> 00:19:31,617
and you would be right.
I'm out.
(laughter)

00:19:31,617 --> 00:19:34,347
Dave, there's no market
for this.

00:19:34,347 --> 00:19:37,297
115 users.

00:19:37,297 --> 00:19:38,617
$35,000 in sales.

00:19:38,617 --> 00:19:42,537
As an investment,
you're about, uh,

00:19:42,537 --> 00:19:44,467
30 years too late. I'm out.

00:19:47,217 --> 00:19:49,267
What I think is so remarkable

00:19:49,267 --> 00:19:52,587
if you've got people
doing this for free for you.

00:19:52,587 --> 00:19:54,547
You're basically
a online computer pimp.

00:19:56,217 --> 00:19:58,297
And believe me, David,

00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,547
it's not worth
a million dollars.

00:20:01,317 --> 00:20:02,317
I'm out.

00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:07,687
Dave, there's three sharks
that are out.
Mm-Hmm.

00:20:07,687 --> 00:20:10,597
David, horrible idea,
horrible pitch,

00:20:10,597 --> 00:20:11,617
horrible valuation.

00:20:11,617 --> 00:20:13,667
I'm out.

00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:15,517
It's all right.
Thank you.

00:20:15,517 --> 00:20:19,467
Well, unlike the other sharks,
I think there is a need

00:20:19,467 --> 00:20:22,367
for live classes
to the 50-plus crowd.

00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:23,617
And this isn't it.

00:20:23,617 --> 00:20:25,547
I don't know
if this is it or not,

00:20:25,547 --> 00:20:28,487
but I think you've got
to do it from the ground up

00:20:28,487 --> 00:20:30,267
and get some traction.

00:20:30,267 --> 00:20:31,497
So, with that, I'm out.

00:20:33,467 --> 00:20:35,687
Thank you, everyone.
I appreciate your time.

00:20:35,687 --> 00:20:37,597
David, you made us laugh.
Thank you.

00:20:37,597 --> 00:20:40,347
Thank you, guys.
Come on, let's get sushi.

00:20:40,347 --> 00:20:43,247
(laughter)

00:20:43,247 --> 00:20:45,397
Thanks, Bruce.

00:20:45,397 --> 00:20:46,517
Humor battles everything.

00:20:46,517 --> 00:20:48,397
Yeah, because
that idea sucked.

00:20:48,397 --> 00:20:50,297
He was terrible.
I don't think so.

00:20:50,297 --> 00:20:52,247
I think Bruce
just wanted to meet Barbara.

00:20:52,247 --> 00:20:53,617
He's my type.

00:20:53,617 --> 00:20:55,337
Sharks, you ripped me
a new one.

00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,247
It was brutal.
But I still love you.

of the future.

00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:34,960
Today, I'm seeking $250,000

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,910
in exchange for 10% equity

Revestor's doing
for real estate

00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,600

Revestor gives you access

that only investors

00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,850
Say you're a first-time

00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:05,810
Let's say you're
a real estate investor...

00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:07,910
I am.
And you want one thing--

00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,480
To make money.

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,650
The most money possible.

00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:15,910
And you know one of the hardest
things to do in the first place

00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,730
is to find deals.

00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:18,880
Go on.

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,910
Let me give you a quick tour
and show you how it works.

00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:24,810
You go to the home page
and you simply tell it

00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,500
what kind of property
you're looking for.

00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,880
Then it tells you
which properties

00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,800
have the most potential
in a map and list view.

00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,800
You can then go
to the detail page,

00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,900
and it gives you all the key
real estate indicators

00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,580
that are associated
with the property.

00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,930
It's so easy to use,
anyone can do it.

00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:49,680
For example, mark,
Barbara, Robert,

00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,680
let's say that you all
recently bought similar homes.

00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,880
What you don't know
is that house "a"

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,480
has the potential
to make money.

00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,680
House "B" is gonna break even.

00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,860
House "C," unfortunately,
is upside down and underwater.

00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,650
Question is, which one of you
bought house "C"?

00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,730
So, Bill, how do you predict

00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:15,810
the value of a house
five years from now?

00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:18,480
Well, our proprietary
algorithm

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,810
makes some assumptions,

00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:21,730
but obviously
it's up to the user

00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,500
to decide
what they believe--

00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,730
(Robert) Tell me about
the proprietary algorithm

00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,480
that you use.

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,510
Like, what criteria do you use
to come up with the best deal?

00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,850
The--the patent
is submitted on the fact

00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:34,700
that we have the ability
to generate and search

00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,660
by key real estate
indicators.

00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,550
Like what?
Where are you
getting the data from?

00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,880
(Robert) Like what?
Just the same source
Everybody else has?

00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,700
We-We're partnered
with the largest

00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,760

Oh, there are so many of them.

when you came out here

00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,950
you were gonna say, "look,
"the world has a huge problem.

00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:56,630
"It's full of blood-sucking
real estate agents

00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:57,850
Like Barbara..."
(laughter)

00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:00,710
"Who suck out all the profits
in their transaction fees

00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,580
"up-Front--3% to 6%,

00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,900
so I'm already underwater
when I buy a house."

00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,480
If you could solve
that problem,

00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,660
get rid of the barbaras
of the world,

00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,930
then you'd have something.

00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:10,730
Get me directly
to the buyer, maybe,

00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:12,480
so I don't have to get
all of that value

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,750
sucked out by Barbara.

00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,750
We still need Barbara
as an expert...

00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,550
no, we don't.
We gotta get rid of her.
But we don't trust
the barbaras.

00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,930
We never need Barbara.
We don't trust
the barbaras, right?

00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,530
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop using "Barbara."
Sorry.

00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,650
(Barbara) I feel I'm missing
something basic here.

00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:24,780
Okay.
Okay.

00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,660
I'm an investor.
I want to buy in Los Angeles.

00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,710
I have $400,000 to spend,

00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:31,560
and I have 30% down.

00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,810
How are you going to locate
the best house,

00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:35,880
not being a fortune-Teller,

00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,800
knowing what's going to happen
in the L.A. market

00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,600
over the next two years,
three years, five years?

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,630
How are you able to make
a prediction on value?

00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:47,560
Best question--
I don't understand
what your magic sauce is here.

00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,760
Best question so far.

00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,910
It--It gives you
key indicators

00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,780
that are associated
with the property to see--

00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,650
Like what?!
for example? For example?

00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:56,830
For example, cash flow,
cap rate,

00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,560
return on investment.
That's a spreadsheet.

00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,680
It--
That's a spreadsheet.

00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,930
Buddy, I can calculate that
on my own.

00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,730
No, we're not cut-And-Pasting
a spreadsheet online.

00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,500
That's not what we're doing.
We're giv--

00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,700
So what are you doing?

00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,880
We're giving people "a"--
house "a," "B," "C"--

00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,880
Which is better?
What's the value of that?

00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,630
I want to stop them
from ripping you apart,

00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:14,580
so maybe I can help you.
(chuckles) Thank you.

00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,910
Do you have any sales?

00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:18,550
We're in ten cities so far.

00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,730
Our revenue model's
not rolled out yet.

00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,900
I'm not here to mess around
and make a few thousand bucks.

00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,910
I want to be one of the largest
real estate web sites,

00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:30,910
do $100 million in revenue,
and be a billion-dollar company.

00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:34,500
I've done this before.
I'm not a "wantrepreneur."

00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,500
I've been around
the block before.
Okay, what did you do before?

00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,580
I built a $20 million company
from scratch.

00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,530
What kind of company was it
and what did you do?

00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:42,950
It was a financial services
company.
(Kevin) Really?

00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:45,480
And what did you do?
That's my area.
What did it do?

00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,660
We're mortgage, real estate,
and life insurance.

00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,760
I know that business very well.
And what happened?

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,730
2007, all of our lenders
stopped funding deals,

00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,810
and it--It was horrible.

00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:57,850
I lost $1 million in a day.
Okay. You know something
about this business.

00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,880
But why couldn't you use
your software to predict that?

00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,810
(laughs) The software
didn't exist then.

00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,960
(Kevin)
What you haven't said is,

00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,630
"here's my model
and how I make revenue."

00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,560
Okay, I'm interested.
I want to buy a home in l.A.

00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,900
How do you make money
for me?
Okay.

00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,900
Okay.
So right now maybe you're

00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,810
going to a foreclosure
Web site...

00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:15,700
yes.
To get auction data,
and you're spending

00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,650
50 bucks a month for that.

00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,880
Here, you can get the M.L.S.
And the auction data.

00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,910
The auction sites just give you
the date and the time

00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:24,550
of the auction.
So I buy the subscription
for $49.95 a month?

00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,860
$99.

00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,660
Because--
$99 a month?

00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,730
Because you're getting both.
You're getting the m.L.S. Data

00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,650
and the foreclosure
auction data...
okay.

00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:33,530
I'm analyzing it for you.

00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,900
(snaps fingers)
I'm gonna instantly give you
the deals in your criteria

00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,860
in your e-mail every day.
So you're really going--

00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,630
You're not going after
the one-Time buyer.

00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,610
You're going after somebody
who's investing in real estate,

00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:44,760
which is a subset of
the real estate buyer market.

00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,650
You're almost a service entity

00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:48,830
for a very small vertical
of financial buyers.

00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,850
The normal home buyer
that buys

00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:53,780
$5 million properties--
Residential properties--
No, no, you're confusing me.

00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:57,650
Is it for the normal couple
that's going out to buy a home,

00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,730
or is it for the shark
out there

00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,700
who wants to get
a foreclosure property

00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,560
and rent it out or flip it?
Which is your audience?

00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,900
I-It's for both,

00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,680
because people
are scared to buy.

00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,950
They want more information.

00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:11,830
Bill, you're only gonna
have that person--

00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,850
Bill, you're talking out of
both sides of your mouth.

00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:15,900
It's incredible.
Okay, Bill, let me see if I
get it, and maybe that'll help.

00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,650
Okay. Okay. Thank you.

00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:19,650
So you're buying the data
from the two sources.
Right.

00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:21,610
That gives you
M.L.S. listings,

00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:22,900
the listings of all the houses
that are for sale,

00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,550
plus another source that's
giving you the auction listings.

00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,880
Right.
Right. And you'll give me
a little bit of help

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,760
with your "algorithms."

00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,910
Right. You're not using
an archaic spreadsheet.

00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:34,580
I'm gonna pay you $99 a month
for access to that?

00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,830
Right.

00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:38,480
You want--
I hate that business.
I'm out.

00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,560
Okay.

00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,880
Well, Bill, I'm glad that Mark
explained it to me as well,

00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,480
because if it was that hard
for you to explain it to me,

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,550
it's gonna be
that much harder

00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:49,760
for you to explain
to customers,

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,650
and that pitch was underwater.
I'm out.

00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,860
I buy a lot
of foreclosed property

00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,480
in my local market,
because I understand it,

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,680
and I have access to brokers
who have great information.

00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,900
They have certain information
that is on no web site.

00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:08,550
I don't think you can possibly
think of a formula

00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,900
that will lead me
to the right conclusion

00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:14,660
that this is a great investment
or it's not a great investment.

00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,850
But you do have one
great thing going for you.

00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:20,480
Nobody can tell
if you're wrong. (laughs)

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,610
No one's gonna know
if you're ever right,

00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:24,860
because the only time
you find out whether you

00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,700
indicated a great investment
or not

00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,960
is when I go to sell it
in two years,

00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,730
five years, eight years.

00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,500
And where are you gonna be then?

00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:34,650
I'm out.

00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:36,880
Thank you.

00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,900
Bill, you have
no business concept.

00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,810
You talk out of
both sides of your mouth.

00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:45,950
I'm gonna build this company

00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:48,800
to a $100 million Company
right next to zillow.

00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,510
(Robert) Bill, there's nothing
wrong with believing that.

00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,830
But the presentation
you came up with today

00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:56,800

a bit of a con artist.

00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,880
I'm not a s--
I'm out.

kicked in here.
I-I know.

respect somebody

00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,580
that comes out of
financial services,

00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,910
'cause it's a very tough space.
And the one

00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,900
you've come out of
was a really tough space.

00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,850
So you're trying
to get back in the game.

00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:17,660
Nothing wrong with that,
but won't be with me. I'm out.

(laughs)
the answer is "Yes."

00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:23,050
of Ice Chips candy.

00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:26,180
We're asking for $250,000

00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:30,280
in exchange for a 15% equity
in our company.

00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,260
In the competitive
candy and mint world,

00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:37,280
xylitol is the hottest
alternative sweetener going.

00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,960
Ice chips are
the yummiest, healthiest

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,050
xylitol candy on the market.

00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:46,060
Most sugar-free candy
and "healthy" candy

00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,210
tastes like petrified flour.

00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:52,130
But our candy comes
in 17 exciting flavors--

00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:55,960
Zesty, stimulating,
and actually good

00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,210
for adults and children.
It's true.

00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:00,950
Xylitol is
a natural sweetener.

00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:03,310
Germs and bacteria
cannot grow on it,

00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:05,360
so dentists love it.

00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,230
Life still hands out
plenty of surprises.

00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:11,110
We thought by this time
we would be doing

00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:14,200
grandma things
for our 37 grandchildren.

00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,060
Wow.
Whoa.

00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,030
But, no,
we're taking orders,

00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:21,080
shipping ice chips,
and negotiating prices

00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,950
all over the world.

00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:26,300
We may have started out
as two grannies in a garage...

00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,060
(laughs)
But believe me,

00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,060
we've grown
far beyond that now.

00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:33,100
And all we had to give up
was the thrilling life

00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:37,410
of scrapbooking and quilting
many of our friends enjoy.
(laughter)

00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:39,110
Not.
Not!

00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,350
(laughter)

00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:43,410
Now we'd like you
to try our ice chips.

00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:44,430
Nicely done.

00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,410
Thank you.
You're welcome.

00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:51,250
Thank you, Charlotte.

00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,380
Thank you.

00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,180
Kevin, Beverly says
she thinks

00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:59,280
she used to babysit you.
(laughter)

00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,050
Tastes great.
Mmm.

00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,280
Doesn't taste sugar-Free.

00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,210
(Robert) So, ladies,
xylitol is all natural?

00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:05,980
It's not chemically made?
Absolutely natural.

00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,330
Yes.
Hmm.

00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:09,230
I've never seen
this type of candy.

00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:12,230
Health food stores are
our primary source for sales.

00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,980
Dentists sell them.

00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,080
A lot of them sell them
in their offices.

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,110
We use American xylitol

00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:21,010
made from the Birch bark
of the Birch tree.

00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:22,260
Any downside
to that chemical?

00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,150
It's something
I'm not familiar with.

00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:25,310
Any side effect?

00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:27,030
Only if you eat
the whole tin.

00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,950
Yeah. Then there can be...
(laughs)

00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:31,400
a little tummy distress--
If you ate the whole tin.

00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,130
Tummy distress?

00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:35,210
What would that be?
Diarrhea.

00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,310
(Daymond and Barbara) Oh.
Oh.

00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,230
(laughing)
(Daymond) It's not
like a laxative.

00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,960
I'm just trying to get
clarity.
Oh, no, no, no.
Not like a laxative.

00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,360
All right, you guys can
continue to eat them then.

00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,410
You're a couple of grannies
on steroids. I get it.

00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:49,980
(laughing)
You're valuing

00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:52,280
your ice chips business

00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,950
at $1.67 million.

00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,160
Yes.
That's quite a bit.

00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,260
Explain to me why you think
it's worth that much money.

00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,210
This year,
up through Friday,

00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:06,280
our sales for ice chips
was $342,000.

00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:08,950
Really?
Yes.

00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:13,000
Last year,
sales were $360,000.

00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,430
Wow. Charlotte,
that's fantastic.

00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:16,200
Sales--
So we've almost doubled.

00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,160
Oh, so you're halfway through.
Yes.

00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,950
So you think you'll hit,
uh, $700,000 this year.
$700,000.

00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:22,150
We actually think
we could hit

00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,110
that million-Dollar mark
by the end of the year.

00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,400
Those are some sweet numbers.
(both laugh)

00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,360
What are you making it for
and what are you selling it for?

00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,310
We make it right now
for $1.11 a tin.

00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:36,080
It wholesales for
$3 and 12 1/2 cents a tin.

00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,250
(Daymond) nice.

00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:40,150
The average sale
in a store is $5.

00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:42,150
Are you opening more accounts,

00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:45,250
or are the same accounts
just increasing their orders?

00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,030
Yes and Yes.

00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:49,060
Nice.
We have about
ten new accounts--

00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,080
10 to 12 new accounts
every week.

00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,400
Why is it shaped like flakes?

00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,010
The honest answer?

00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:58,330
No, I want you to lie
to me, granny.
(both laugh)

00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:00,360
Two grannies in a garage
couldn't press out

00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,260
100,000 little pellets.

00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,000
(Beverly) Yeah.
(Robert) Come on, seriously?

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,250
So you just hit it
with a hammer? Bang?
Serious.

00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,030
Yep. Yes.
But they said

00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:09,330
you couldn't make hard candy
from xylitol,

00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:12,130
and we did what they said
couldn't be done.

00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:14,430
And by pouring it
and then breaking it this way

00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:17,410
and calling it ice chips,
everyone has loved it.
(laughs)

00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:20,250
Tell me your background
before you became grannies.

00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,110
Well,
I was a romance writer.

00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:25,200
So probably not gonna
help you much.
(laughter)

00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,400
I have a bachelor of science
degree in natural health.

00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,410
(Daymond) There's other candies
in the market.

00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:31,350
I-I just want to know
about your competitors.

00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:36,100
Spry is our biggest competitor,
'cause dentists also do them.

00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,000
But they have
a pressed candy, like...

00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,380
what other pressed candy?
Like an altoid?

00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,310
Maybe Altoids is pressed.
Yeah. And are these sold

00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:44,430
only in, uh, mainly, uh,
health food stores,

00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:47,180
or are they in 7-Elevens
and Walgreens and...

00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,330
Well, that's distribution.
It's hard to get in.

00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:51,110
We do have
a lot of grocery stores.

00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,380
We're in grocery--
But there's a distributor

00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,210
you want to sell to
that's gonna supply all them.

00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:56,260
(Beverly and Charlotte) Yes.
(Daymond) So you guys--

00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,030
You have everything.
You know, you know your market,

00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,180
you know your numbers.
You're making money.

00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:03,080
So why are you here?
Automation.

00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:07,110
To bring our margin down
where we make this for 77 cents.

00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,400
Basically want us
to buy you a machine

00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,380
that's gonna cost
$250,000, right?

00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,100
Yes.
Well--

00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,330
$250,000--That's not even
$5,000 per grandchild.

00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:17,280
Get those grandchildren
out there working.

00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,100
That's true.
Get them to make
a few thousand bucks,

00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,350
and you're good to go.
We are.

00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:23,030
We have two of them
working there now.
(both laugh)

00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,400
I'd like to make you
an offer.

00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,050
What I like best
about the product

00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:29,410
over all of the candy products
I've seen, dietary or not,

00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:33,160
is I love the idea
that you have chips.

00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,160
You can pick how big
or little a chip

00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,980
you want to pop in your mouth.

00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,360
I don't know why, but I love,
like, picking it out.
(laughing)

00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,280
Like a choice.
(Mark) Yeah, you're right.

00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,410
(Barbara) You know?
That's unique.

00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:46,100
And I would just like
to go on a sales call with you,

00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,180
just to see what you do.
You're a hoot.

00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,260
(laughing)
So it would be three grandmas.

00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:52,110
Whatever. No problem.
The full granny gang.

00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:54,280
If you wanna call me
a grandma, no problem.

00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,100
So I'm gonna give you
half the investment--$125,000.

00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,050
But I'll have to have
more stock.

00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,400
I would need 1/3 of the business
for that--33%.

00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,260
Ohh! That's crazy.

00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,200
For just your piece?

00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,280
Yes, for just my piece.

00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,410
So, Barbara,
they have to go out and raise

00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:15,280
the other $125,000,
and get another 33%.

00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,260
You're a vicious granny.

00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:20,260
♪♪♪

00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,900
♪♪♪

00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,533
Beverly and Charlotte
have one partial offer

00:37:33,533 --> 00:37:35,066
on the table,
from Barbara.

00:37:35,066 --> 00:37:38,046
But she wants
a whopping 33% of the company

00:37:38,046 --> 00:37:39,996
for just her half
of the investment.

00:37:39,996 --> 00:37:43,136
You're a vicious granny.
I-I--
I'm not vicious at all.

00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:45,986
Ladies, what else
is in this candy?

00:37:45,986 --> 00:37:47,266
(Barbara) Hold on. Hold on.
Finish, Barb. Finish, Barb.

00:37:47,266 --> 00:37:49,046
Please, please, please.
(laughs)

00:37:49,046 --> 00:37:51,966
What I guarantee you--
as part of the offer--

00:37:51,966 --> 00:37:54,216
is that I'll get you
in 3,000 big box stores

00:37:54,216 --> 00:37:55,886
to sell your product.

00:37:55,886 --> 00:37:57,866
Ooh. Interesting.
And that's worth
a lot of money.

00:37:57,866 --> 00:37:59,236
Would you feel free
to take out your dentures

00:37:59,236 --> 00:38:01,016
and throw it at her...
(laughing)

00:38:01,016 --> 00:38:03,846
For that rude
and insensitive offer?
What is wrong with that?

00:38:03,846 --> 00:38:05,816
How long would it take you
to get into all those

00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:07,096
big box stores?
Not long.

00:38:10,046 --> 00:38:13,046
Grannies, I want to put
the other half up

00:38:13,046 --> 00:38:15,886
that Barbara needs, and you
get something else from me.

00:38:15,886 --> 00:38:18,136
I'm gonna talk her back
into sanity on value.

00:38:18,136 --> 00:38:19,986
So what I'm gonna say is this--

00:38:19,986 --> 00:38:23,096
I'll put up the other
$125,000,

00:38:23,096 --> 00:38:24,936
and we will each get
20% each.

00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:28,046
So we're taking 40%,
not 66%.

00:38:28,046 --> 00:38:31,046
You know what?
I will retrench a bit

00:38:31,046 --> 00:38:33,136
on that value,
but not with this guy.

00:38:35,886 --> 00:38:37,136
He's no fun to work with.

00:38:37,136 --> 00:38:39,136
He's totally focused
on money,

00:38:39,136 --> 00:38:41,116
and you both know
it's not about the money.
You need somebody

00:38:41,116 --> 00:38:43,266
like Mr. Wonderful
in the model.
Trust me, you don't need him.

00:38:43,266 --> 00:38:45,266
So I'll do that deal. Any other
guys wanna do that deal?

00:38:45,266 --> 00:38:47,066
No problem.
But not with this guy.

00:38:47,066 --> 00:38:51,016
So I'll do $125,000 for 20%,

00:38:51,016 --> 00:38:52,266
because I must say,
I did feel a little bit greedy.

00:38:52,266 --> 00:38:54,136
Look at the value I've
created for you already.

00:38:54,136 --> 00:38:56,046
I took her down
from being insane,

00:38:56,046 --> 00:38:58,146
asking for 66%.

00:38:58,146 --> 00:39:00,966
(Daymond) Well, I'm--I'm--
I'm interested.

00:39:00,966 --> 00:39:03,796
My only concern is
I don't want, uh, you guys

00:39:03,796 --> 00:39:05,136
to be doing the manufacturing.

00:39:05,136 --> 00:39:07,216
I don't want to have to learn
that part of the business.

00:39:07,216 --> 00:39:12,796
So what I'd be interested in
is $250,000 for...

00:39:12,796 --> 00:39:14,246
30%,

00:39:14,246 --> 00:39:17,266
and we go out and take
the manufacturing elsewhere.

00:39:19,166 --> 00:39:21,866
Do we have any other offers?
Solid?

00:39:21,866 --> 00:39:22,986
Patience is a virtue.

00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:24,816
(laughs)
(Daymond)
I'm the only full offer.

00:39:24,816 --> 00:39:26,966
You have half offers
from Kevin and Barbara.

00:39:26,966 --> 00:39:28,946
Well, Barbara doesn't want
to play in this candy box.
And these savages

00:39:28,946 --> 00:39:30,836
want to take 40%
of your company.

00:39:30,836 --> 00:39:32,866
I-I delivered so much value
to the grannies,

00:39:32,866 --> 00:39:35,036
and I'm getting nothing for it.
I'm really heartbroken.

00:39:35,036 --> 00:39:36,936
We're smiling at you pretty,
if that helps. (laughs)

00:39:36,936 --> 00:39:39,866
It helps.

00:39:39,866 --> 00:39:41,116
I'm interested in working
with Barbara,

00:39:41,116 --> 00:39:44,046
because I think she works really
well with consumer products.

00:39:44,046 --> 00:39:47,916
I see a lot of ways
that we can work together.

00:39:47,916 --> 00:39:49,886
So I'm happy to go in
with Barbara

00:39:49,886 --> 00:39:52,286
at $125k for 20%,

00:39:52,286 --> 00:39:54,196
and $125k for 20%.

00:39:54,196 --> 00:39:56,286
You know, when I put out
my offer,

00:39:56,286 --> 00:39:58,146
I was hoping
Mark would jump in with me.

00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,186
There's no better partner here.

00:40:00,186 --> 00:40:02,036
(inhales)
Ladies, it--

00:40:02,036 --> 00:40:05,186
It's sweeter than I would
have offered you.

00:40:05,186 --> 00:40:06,996
I'm out.

00:40:08,046 --> 00:40:09,216
Thank you.

00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,146
Okay, grannies,
let's shake it up a bit.

00:40:11,146 --> 00:40:12,986
I want back in this deal.

00:40:16,886 --> 00:40:18,886
Okay, so here's what
I'm gonna propose.

00:40:18,886 --> 00:40:20,096
I want to join Daymond.

00:40:20,096 --> 00:40:22,046
So he'll put up $125,000.

00:40:22,046 --> 00:40:25,836
I'll put up $125,000.
So you get your $250,000.

00:40:25,836 --> 00:40:29,036
But I want to be part
of a 35% deal.

00:40:29,036 --> 00:40:30,086
All right?

00:40:30,086 --> 00:40:31,996
But you get two sharks.

00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:33,886
And it's still way less

00:40:33,886 --> 00:40:35,286
than what Barbara and Mark
are asking for.

00:40:35,286 --> 00:40:38,096
They're so greedy.

00:40:38,096 --> 00:40:40,886
Ooh! So, grandmas...
(Daymond) I think--
Yeah, I think, uh...

00:40:40,886 --> 00:40:42,236
grandmas, you--
That might sweeten the deal.

00:40:42,236 --> 00:40:46,246
Uh, if you have two sharks
here for less percentage.

00:40:46,246 --> 00:40:48,796
So, grandmas,
Kevin and Daymond,

00:40:48,796 --> 00:40:50,096
or Mark and Barbara?

00:40:50,096 --> 00:40:51,216
The sweet deal,
or the yuck mouths?

00:40:53,986 --> 00:40:56,086
The vindictive deal,
or the honest deal?

00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:57,966
We know.
We know.

00:40:57,966 --> 00:41:00,146
Oh, you do? Wow.

00:41:00,146 --> 00:41:02,796
(Daymond)
I've decided that--
(Kevin) What--

00:41:02,796 --> 00:41:05,146
I've decided that I-I'm
dropping my partner already...

00:41:05,146 --> 00:41:07,236
Oh.

00:41:07,236 --> 00:41:09,046
And I'm going down--
Whoa, everything
changes in the tank!

00:41:09,046 --> 00:41:12,066
And I'm going down
to 25% for $250,000.

00:41:12,066 --> 00:41:13,266
(Robert and Mark) WHOA!
Whoa!

00:41:13,266 --> 00:41:16,286
Daymond, what happened there?
Your offer is $250,000

00:41:16,286 --> 00:41:18,016
for 25%...
(Kevin) Whoa.

00:41:18,016 --> 00:41:19,886
But you, just like Barbara,

00:41:19,886 --> 00:41:21,066
are dumping Kevin to the curb.

00:41:21,066 --> 00:41:22,796
I'm dumping Kevin.
The only reason why

00:41:22,796 --> 00:41:25,886
is because I feel this
Barbara crap growing on them,

00:41:25,886 --> 00:41:28,236
and I want to make sure
that they don't make

00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:30,146
the wrong decision.

00:41:30,146 --> 00:41:32,216
So, what are you gonna do?

00:41:40,866 --> 00:41:41,966
You can tell.
Okay.

00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:43,936
We're gonna go
with Barbara and Mark.

00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,146
Ahh!
Good decision.

00:41:45,146 --> 00:41:47,846
Yes!
Thank you so much.

00:41:47,846 --> 00:41:50,836
Thank you.
Smart people.
You picked the good people.

00:41:50,836 --> 00:41:52,096
I never liked grandmothers.

00:41:52,096 --> 00:41:54,266
Don't be mean to grandma.
Bye.

00:41:54,266 --> 00:41:56,036
Thanks, ladies.
Bye.

00:41:56,036 --> 00:41:57,886
(Charlotte)
We so appreciate them all,

00:41:57,886 --> 00:42:00,896
but we just really felt
the Barbara/Mark combination,

00:42:00,896 --> 00:42:03,946
for our personality,
was probably gonna be the best.

00:42:03,946 --> 00:42:05,146
Business-wise,

00:42:05,146 --> 00:42:07,286
a different decision
might be good,

00:42:07,286 --> 00:42:10,216
but personality-wise,
we will...

00:42:10,216 --> 00:42:12,936
be happy.
Kill it together.
(laughs)

00:42:12,936 --> 00:42:15,116
listen, I can go to bed
knowing I helped granny.

00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:17,146
Talk about judging a book
by its cover.

00:42:17,146 --> 00:42:18,216
They're hustlers.

00:42:18,216 --> 00:42:21,046
This is something
that Barbara will enjoy.

00:42:21,046 --> 00:42:22,816
They will love to get
on the phone with her

00:42:22,816 --> 00:42:24,946
and hear her ramble about
her cockamamie stories

00:42:24,946 --> 00:42:26,916
for, like, two weeks.
(laughs)

00:42:26,916 --> 00:42:30,216
I loved the grandmas.
I love the gramas, too,
and I hate--UGH!

00:42:30,216 --> 00:42:34,236
