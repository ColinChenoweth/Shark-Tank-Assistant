you just screwed up?

00:04:57,834 --> 00:04:59,569
We built all of our databases.
There are no royalties.

00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:01,171
Do you own this business
yourself?

00:05:01,171 --> 00:05:03,807
That's correct. I actually have
a group of investors as well.

00:05:03,807 --> 00:05:05,608
You do.
Uh, I did. I raised
a little bit of capital

00:05:05,608 --> 00:05:07,344
to get this off the ground.

00:05:07,344 --> 00:05:09,012
Keep in mind, I put 30,000 bucks
of my own money

00:05:09,012 --> 00:05:10,447
to get this thing going.

00:05:10,447 --> 00:05:12,215
And what is your background that
you've come up with this idea?

00:05:12,215 --> 00:05:14,084
I used to run marketing
for myspace

00:05:14,084 --> 00:05:16,486
during the good days
for three and a half years.

00:05:16,486 --> 00:05:19,055
What are your sales?
That's all that really matters.
Sure. So in the 21 months,

00:05:19,055 --> 00:05:21,691
we've done $450,000 in revenue.
Okay, and you've made...

00:05:21,691 --> 00:05:22,926
(Robert) Wow.
How much money on that?

00:05:22,926 --> 00:05:24,127
Everything goes right back
into the company, 100%.

00:05:24,127 --> 00:05:26,262
Josh, how many downloads
of the app do you have?

00:05:26,262 --> 00:05:28,198
Just around 500,000, uh,
downloads of the application.

00:05:28,198 --> 00:05:31,267
Josh, let's go back
to the investors for a sec.

00:05:31,267 --> 00:05:33,470
How much money did you raise
in total?

00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,238
We raised $1.6 million
in total.

00:05:35,238 --> 00:05:36,573
And what was the valuation

00:05:36,573 --> 00:05:38,908
of the 1.6 you raised
in the valley?
$6 million.

00:05:38,908 --> 00:05:40,744
You're giving us the same value,
am I right?

00:05:40,744 --> 00:05:41,978
That's right.

00:05:41,978 --> 00:05:44,447
So, Josh, your strategy is
to run like hell

00:05:44,447 --> 00:05:46,049
because there's nothing
proprietary here.

00:05:46,049 --> 00:05:48,051
Anybody can do this.
Let's be honest with each other.

00:05:48,051 --> 00:05:49,753
Well, being totally honest,
that is not correct.

00:05:49,753 --> 00:05:51,488
It takes a tremendous amount
of ingenuity

00:05:51,488 --> 00:05:53,056
to do what we did.
Okay, but--

00:05:53,056 --> 00:05:54,224
Absolutely.
That's easy to do. There's tons
of people who do that.

00:05:54,224 --> 00:05:55,725
This is not a one-winner
takes all.

00:05:55,725 --> 00:05:57,494
This is about coming up
with a great product

00:05:57,494 --> 00:05:59,496
that people absolutely love.
But that doesn't mean

00:05:59,496 --> 00:06:01,698
it can't be replicated easily
by using third party products.

00:06:01,698 --> 00:06:04,134
But that is the 1,000-Pound
postcard in the room.
Yeah, no, absolutely.

00:06:04,134 --> 00:06:06,136
Josh, I'm telling you--
but the point being is that
we've hit the market.

00:06:06,136 --> 00:06:07,637
We've got--If you look
at web sites,

00:06:07,637 --> 00:06:09,239
if you look at bloggers,
you look at editorial,

00:06:09,239 --> 00:06:11,041
and they talk about
"Hey, what's interesting

00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,542
connecting the online
to offline?"

00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:14,811
they're gonna point
to our product.
Here's the problem, Josh.

00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:18,915
The concept of valuing this
at $6 million is ridiculous.

00:06:18,915 --> 00:06:21,551
You live in
the silicon valley bubble,

00:06:21,551 --> 00:06:23,019

because there's
no I.P.O. market anymore

00:06:27,824 --> 00:06:29,426
for middle-sized companies
like yours,

00:06:29,426 --> 00:06:30,560
so you have to get acquired.

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,661
I hear your point, right?

00:06:31,661 --> 00:06:33,196
My point is this,
is that we haven't even

00:06:33,196 --> 00:06:34,497
begun marketing, right?

00:06:34,497 --> 00:06:37,400
I get that. Look, you fell
to the silicon valley curse.

00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,635
If you were to come in here,
Saying, look,

00:06:38,635 --> 00:06:40,970
"We gotta raise $200,000
or $300,000

00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,906
at a $2 million valuation,"

00:06:42,906 --> 00:06:45,275
then we can visualize,
okay, nice little business,

00:06:45,275 --> 00:06:46,776
and we could sell it
for 6.

00:06:46,776 --> 00:06:48,344
But you're already at 6.
Mark--

00:06:48,344 --> 00:06:50,246
The problem is you've gotta
sell it big

00:06:50,246 --> 00:06:51,915
to get any type of return
for us.

00:06:51,915 --> 00:06:54,684
So I-I think what I have is
a great group of investors

00:06:54,684 --> 00:06:56,386
that are super supportive
of us.

00:06:56,386 --> 00:06:57,587
Josh, you could stay up
all night.

00:06:57,587 --> 00:06:58,822
That doesn't mean
you're gonna get lucky, right?

00:06:58,822 --> 00:07:00,623
Totally.
You've gotta get lucky
in order

00:07:00,623 --> 00:07:02,826
for this to really work
for investors.
Absolutely.

00:07:02,826 --> 00:07:04,661
You have to have an exit
that takes some luck,

00:07:04,661 --> 00:07:05,728
and I just don't see it.

00:07:05,728 --> 00:07:08,498
How much cash do you have
left in the bank?

00:07:08,498 --> 00:07:09,966
We have $185,00
in the bank.

00:07:09,966 --> 00:07:11,568
You're screwed. I'm out.

00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:16,573
Out of $1.6 million,
you're down to $185,000?

00:07:16,573 --> 00:07:18,108
$185,000, correct.

00:07:18,108 --> 00:07:19,809
You're gonna blow up
in 90 days, you don't get cash.

00:07:19,809 --> 00:07:23,646
You need to raise right now
this $300,000.

00:07:23,646 --> 00:07:25,448
You are running like
that little postcard guy.

00:07:25,448 --> 00:07:28,852
There is nothing proprietary
about what you're doing.

00:07:28,852 --> 00:07:30,320
I'm not diminishing
your business.

00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,323
I'm just telling you I could
do it for less than $6 million.

00:07:33,323 --> 00:07:37,060
Absolutely not what I invest
in this. I'm out.

00:07:39,095 --> 00:07:40,864
(Barbara) There's a couple
things I really like.

00:07:40,864 --> 00:07:44,601
I like nothing better than
a friend sending me

00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:46,369
an actual photograph.

00:07:46,369 --> 00:07:47,937
I take hundreds of them
of my kids,

00:07:47,937 --> 00:07:50,573
but I never print them out,
and there's a difference.
Exactly.

00:07:50,573 --> 00:07:52,575
So when I get a photo
in the mail,

00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,210
for me it's a present,
all right?
Mm-hmm.

00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,445
The idea that I would get

00:07:55,445 --> 00:07:58,314
also wrapped into that
a postcard is great.

00:07:58,314 --> 00:08:00,917
I think of a postcard
as a present, too.

00:08:00,917 --> 00:08:02,218
Sure.
Nobody sends them anymore,

00:08:02,218 --> 00:08:03,286
and of your kid...
sure.

00:08:03,286 --> 00:08:04,454
It's a win, all right?
Sure.

00:08:04,454 --> 00:08:06,656
But there's something
that really disturbs me,

00:08:06,656 --> 00:08:08,825
and that is
this postcard lacks

00:08:08,825 --> 00:08:10,126
in the warm and fuzzy
emotional piece

00:08:10,126 --> 00:08:13,096
which you're hard-selling here,
is that it's typefaced.

00:08:13,096 --> 00:08:16,132
Can you scroll your whole
message or only your signature?

00:08:16,132 --> 00:08:19,202
Today we can just do
your signature and a picture.

00:08:19,202 --> 00:08:21,037
Well, that's a problem.
Tomorrow there's no reason
why we couldn't do any of that.

00:08:21,037 --> 00:08:22,071
It takes the warm and fuzzy
out of it for me.

00:08:22,071 --> 00:08:23,206
I'm out.

00:08:23,206 --> 00:08:26,676
Okay.

00:08:26,676 --> 00:08:29,078
Guys, we've got a business
that actually brings in money.

00:08:29,078 --> 00:08:32,649
It's $450,000 in 21 months.

00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:34,317
Yeah, but you have hardly
any money left.
We have not added any gasoline

00:08:34,317 --> 00:08:35,952
to that flame at all.

00:08:35,952 --> 00:08:38,388
So out of the downloads
or the users,

00:08:38,388 --> 00:08:39,622
what's the age range?

00:08:39,622 --> 00:08:41,291
Our target market
would be

00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:44,027
somewhere in this
21-to-45-year-old female,

00:08:44,027 --> 00:08:47,297
but my partner and investor
in the company is Selena Gomez.

00:08:48,631 --> 00:08:50,800
Sorry. The Selena Gomez
that my kids love?

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,268
Totally.

00:08:52,268 --> 00:08:54,103
Uh, she invested
in both rounds--

00:08:54,103 --> 00:08:55,505
The angel round as well as
the seed round of financing.

00:08:55,505 --> 00:08:57,340
My kids travel
all over the place.

00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,042
I love my kids.
I miss my kids.

00:08:59,042 --> 00:09:01,144
They never e-mail me.
They never text me.

00:09:01,144 --> 00:09:02,679
I think my kids would use this.

00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:04,180
They're always sending
pictures.

00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,381
They never...
so what you're saying--
they won't take the time

00:09:05,381 --> 00:09:06,649
to e-mail or text, but they're
gonna download an app,

00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:08,117
take the picture,
and click "Send"?
Yeah, Mark,

00:09:08,117 --> 00:09:10,486
because they know daddy--They
know that daddy would love it.

00:09:12,188 --> 00:09:14,924
I think it's a great idea,
but, you know, you said,

00:09:14,924 --> 00:09:16,593
"I have patents pending."

00:09:16,593 --> 00:09:19,062
You don't know if
you're going to get it or not

00:09:19,062 --> 00:09:20,830
and really get out there
fast and furious.

00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:23,366
And for that reason, I'm out.

00:09:23,366 --> 00:09:25,602
All right.

00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,773
All right, who's left here?
Robert, I think.

00:09:33,309 --> 00:09:34,477
Robert sees the vision.

00:09:34,477 --> 00:09:36,646
Yeah, Josh,
I do see the vision.

00:09:36,646 --> 00:09:39,249
But I kind of
agree with Mark.

00:09:39,249 --> 00:09:41,451
Your value is
a silicon valley bubble,

00:09:41,451 --> 00:09:43,653
and you'd have to sell
for an enormous amount

00:09:43,653 --> 00:09:44,821
just to get some return.

00:09:44,821 --> 00:09:46,155
Right.

00:09:46,155 --> 00:09:47,724
I love the idea, though.

00:09:47,724 --> 00:09:49,959
I think it's a great vision.
I appreciate that.

00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:53,696
But... I'm not comfortable
with the $6 million valuation.

00:09:55,698 --> 00:09:58,501
But I am comfortable
with a $3 million valuation.

00:09:58,501 --> 00:10:02,572
So I'll do $300,000 for 10%.

00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,676

Let me ask you this.

00:10:43,287 --> 00:10:45,222
Would you consider doing
something more on the lines

00:10:45,222 --> 00:10:46,724
of a $5 million valuation?

00:10:46,724 --> 00:10:49,727
And that's 6% of your company.
Correct.

00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,129
That allows me to keep
my current group of investors

00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:53,731
that I have
a lot of respect for

After $1.6 million in 2 years,

00:10:58,235 --> 00:10:59,904
you're down
to the last $180,000,

00:10:59,904 --> 00:11:02,373
and the reason I think my money
brings the premium is

00:11:02,373 --> 00:11:04,208
you can't survive
without that money.

00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,176

It's my money. I worked
really hard for my money.

00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:15,486
I get the privilege of saying
what I feel it's worth.
Right.

00:11:15,486 --> 00:11:17,354
So...

00:11:17,354 --> 00:11:20,958
I'm comfortable with $3 million.
You're saying $5 million.

00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,259
Now it's up to you.

00:11:27,398 --> 00:11:30,167

itself to something larger,

appreciate

for the company,

that significant of a haircut

(sighs) I'll ask you again.

00:11:39,843 --> 00:11:43,013
What about something closer
to the $5 million range?

00:11:43,013 --> 00:11:44,882
And even if it's at 4.8.

00:11:44,882 --> 00:11:47,785
Find me at 4.8,
and let's do a deal.

00:11:50,287 --> 00:11:52,289
Okay, my last offer--$4 million.

00:11:52,289 --> 00:11:55,559
That's $300,000 for 7 1/2%.

00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:58,195
I think
there's significant value

00:11:58,195 --> 00:11:59,763
in having a shark onboard.

00:11:59,763 --> 00:12:03,534
(exhales) Hone--
I really appreciate the offer.

00:12:03,534 --> 00:12:06,904
I don't think at $4 million
of valuation, I can do that.

00:12:06,904 --> 00:12:09,139
But the company
is more than that.

00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:12,109
I swear it is. I know it is.
So you're not accepting
his offer.

00:12:12,109 --> 00:12:16,380
Find me at 4.5, and let's make
this thing happen.

Listen, you're investing

Under two years.

00:12:21,518 --> 00:12:23,387
as soon as you came out
that saw it...

00:12:28,192 --> 00:12:29,860
but not in the price.
You're not a fan of his price.

00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,395
I'm not a fan of the price,
and that's my privilege

00:12:31,395 --> 00:12:34,098
as a shark.
(sighs) $300,000
at a $4 million valuation--

00:12:34,098 --> 00:12:35,466
is that what you're saying?

00:12:35,466 --> 00:12:38,002
I'm saying $300,000 at--
For 7 1/2%,

00:12:38,002 --> 00:12:40,671

a $4 million valuation.

00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,572
After airing on "Shark Tank,"

00:13:48,572 --> 00:13:52,543
We did $230,000 in sales
in one week.

00:13:52,543 --> 00:13:54,344
We're up to $700,000
in sales,

00:13:54,344 --> 00:13:57,347
and it looks like we'll close in
on $2 million this year.

00:13:57,347 --> 00:13:58,749
That's a ton of money.
(laughs)

Ladies!

00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,619
(Danielle) When we first
took the deal with Kevin,

00:14:02,619 --> 00:14:06,323
it pretty much felt like we were
making a deal with the devil,

00:14:06,323 --> 00:14:07,925
but he's like a little angel
in disguise.

00:14:07,925 --> 00:14:09,893
$700,000 since the show.

00:14:09,893 --> 00:14:12,963
And you've paid me back
my full $75,000.

00:14:12,963 --> 00:14:13,997
That's what "Shark Tank's"
All about.

00:14:13,997 --> 00:14:15,132
Those are huge numbers.

00:14:15,132 --> 00:14:18,001
Our "Shark tank" Experience
was a big risk,

00:14:18,001 --> 00:14:20,204
but a really well-Calculated
risk.

00:14:20,204 --> 00:14:22,272
Everything that we worked
so hard to achieve

00:14:22,272 --> 00:14:24,274
has been
completely validated.

00:14:24,274 --> 00:14:25,943
All right,
I'm selling cupcakes.

00:14:25,943 --> 00:14:27,010
Wicked good cupcakes.

00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,879
The great thing
about "Shark tank"

00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:30,180
is it changes lives.

00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,516

which is 36,000 jars
of pickles.

00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,391
Wow.

00:16:54,391 --> 00:16:56,927
What does a jar cost?

00:16:56,927 --> 00:16:59,630
Suggested retail price
is $6.99.

00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,132
And what do you sell them
wholesale for?
Average--$4.

00:17:02,132 --> 00:17:03,367
And what's your cost?
(Lori) and what does
it cost you to make?

00:17:03,367 --> 00:17:05,035
Our cost is $1--
Our cost is $1.93.

So right now we have stores
that want our product.

00:17:07,871 --> 00:17:10,874
We just don't have the money
to produce the inventory.

00:17:10,874 --> 00:17:12,643
For inventory and producing,
yeah.

00:17:12,643 --> 00:17:14,778
And where have you sold them?
We actually are available

00:17:14,778 --> 00:17:17,047
in 26 states
and about 200 locations.

00:17:17,047 --> 00:17:18,715
Amazing.
Yeah, but--

00:17:18,715 --> 00:17:19,716
do you sell them yourself?
(Robert)
are you using a distributor?

00:17:19,716 --> 00:17:21,084
We do.
We are using a distributor.

00:17:21,084 --> 00:17:22,853
We're signed on with the largest
specialty food distributor

00:17:22,853 --> 00:17:24,354
in the U.S.
You know, you're--

00:17:24,354 --> 00:17:26,089
You're in a classic
entrepreneur's dilemma, right?
Yeah.

00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:27,958
Because you don't
have enough inventory

00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,426
to grow with the company, so--
but it's a good dilemma
to have.

00:17:29,426 --> 00:17:30,827
(Lynnae and Aly) Yeah.
It's a good problem to have,
right?

00:17:30,827 --> 00:17:33,463
But what I'm saying is
in order for us to invest,

00:17:33,463 --> 00:17:34,932
we have to see beyond that.

00:17:34,932 --> 00:17:36,767
Do you have anything
that's so differentiated,

00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,001
people are gonna say,
"Wow"?

00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:39,903
I wanna tell you
the answer for his question.

00:17:39,903 --> 00:17:41,972
The differentiator
are the two of you.

00:17:41,972 --> 00:17:43,573
What else do you do
to market the product

00:17:43,573 --> 00:17:46,109
other than a fancy display?

00:17:46,109 --> 00:17:47,477
We do really creative things.

00:17:47,477 --> 00:17:49,513
We did the national pickle hunt
within our city last year

00:17:49,513 --> 00:17:51,982
that was covered
both locally and nationally.

00:17:51,982 --> 00:17:53,684
And that was your idea?
Yes.

00:17:53,684 --> 00:17:55,352
Mm-hmm, and throughout the day,
there was little clues posted,

00:17:55,352 --> 00:17:57,587
and whoever got there first
to find the jar

00:17:57,587 --> 00:18:00,834
got a package worth
anywhere from $200 to $1,000.

00:18:00,834 --> 00:18:02,302
The video footage
from the newscasts--

00:18:02,302 --> 00:18:05,572
Literally people are running
down the streets of our city,

00:18:05,572 --> 00:18:07,474
trying to find these jars,
and it was a huge success,

00:18:07,474 --> 00:18:09,075
so we're planning
on doing that every year.

00:18:09,075 --> 00:18:10,577
Chasing the big pickle.
(laughing)

00:18:10,577 --> 00:18:12,112
Chasing the pickle, so...

00:18:12,112 --> 00:18:13,914
look, we've seen food products,

00:18:13,914 --> 00:18:16,183
but you've obviously
been very ambitious

00:18:16,183 --> 00:18:18,385
and successful
in marketing this,

00:18:18,385 --> 00:18:21,021
and I'm trying to figure out
how do I make money with this?

00:18:21,021 --> 00:18:22,389
How do you scale the business?

00:18:22,389 --> 00:18:24,090
We have--next month,
we have a meeting

00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,026
with one of the largest
retailers in the U.S

00:18:26,026 --> 00:18:27,260
because they just--
(Kevin) Who is that?

00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,262
Target.

00:18:29,262 --> 00:18:30,864
They came to us, though,

00:18:30,864 --> 00:18:33,200
because they expanded
into grocery last year,

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,968
and now they want to expand
their specialty line.

00:18:34,968 --> 00:18:36,803
That would be
a game-Changer for me.
(Lori) Yes.

00:18:36,803 --> 00:18:38,939
If it works, then you're
in the big league.

00:18:38,939 --> 00:18:41,675
I'm not sure you guys are gonna
be able to pull that off.

00:18:41,675 --> 00:18:44,744
Our distribution channels
already deliver to Target.
I'm Target.

00:18:44,744 --> 00:18:46,179
Tell me why
I should carry your pickles

00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:48,882
over the other 20 other ones.

00:18:48,882 --> 00:18:51,084
We really appeal to
a gourmet, high-end... market.

00:18:51,084 --> 00:18:53,587
Is it reflected in your price?

00:18:53,587 --> 00:18:54,588
Yeah, $6.99. Yeah.
Yeah, $6.99.

00:18:54,588 --> 00:18:55,755
(Robert) is that--
the average--

00:18:55,755 --> 00:18:57,791
How does that compare
to a normal pickle jar?

00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:58,859
A normal pickle jar--

00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:01,127
The average
is about $3, $3.50.

00:19:01,127 --> 00:19:02,729
(Kevin) Wow.
But in specialty pickles--
Specialty pickles, though--

00:19:02,729 --> 00:19:04,331
Twice.
Okay, ladies,

00:19:04,331 --> 00:19:05,599
you just walked in
with huge risk.
$5.99, so it's $9.99.

00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:09,336
Why would Target put a $7 jar in
when the market's at $3?

00:19:09,336 --> 00:19:12,038
Because specialty food
has been growing by 22%

00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:13,640
over the last several years.

00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,511
You guys, I feel there are
a lot of competition

00:19:17,511 --> 00:19:19,112
already out there.

00:19:19,112 --> 00:19:21,047
I think you guys are wonderful,

00:19:21,047 --> 00:19:22,782
but for me,

00:19:22,782 --> 00:19:24,918
I don't like sweet pickles,

00:19:24,918 --> 00:19:28,855
and I do have to like
whatever it is I invest in.

00:19:28,855 --> 00:19:31,725
So I'm out on this one.

00:19:31,725 --> 00:19:32,826
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:19:32,826 --> 00:19:34,794
Guys, I think you have
a nice little business.

00:19:34,794 --> 00:19:36,630
I think you guys hustle,
which is great.

00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:37,898
You're creative.

00:19:37,898 --> 00:19:40,100
And the big guys
aren't paying attention to you

00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,536
because you're $144,000
in sales.

00:19:42,536 --> 00:19:44,271
You--You don't matter to them.

00:19:44,271 --> 00:19:45,505
But as you grow,

00:19:45,505 --> 00:19:46,773
and you will,
they'll start paying attention.

00:19:46,773 --> 00:19:49,075
They'll make a decision.
"do I buy them?"

00:19:49,075 --> 00:19:51,611
you're not big enough.
"do I crush them

00:19:51,611 --> 00:19:54,548
by just putting out
a comparable product?"

00:19:54,548 --> 00:19:58,885
probably, and for that reason,
I'm out.

00:19:58,885 --> 00:20:00,053
We know that
with any type of food,

00:20:00,053 --> 00:20:01,988
there really is never
anything proprietary

00:20:01,988 --> 00:20:04,124
Because someone Can create
something similar,

00:20:04,124 --> 00:20:06,326
so our plan is to explode
into the market

00:20:06,326 --> 00:20:07,661
and gain as much distribution
as we can,

00:20:07,661 --> 00:20:08,895
and we do actually have interest

00:20:08,895 --> 00:20:11,998
from several large--
Large stores.

00:20:11,998 --> 00:20:14,634
No one's beating you up yet
because you're--You're so nice,

00:20:14,634 --> 00:20:16,970
but now it's my chance
to do that, so I'm going to.

00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,473
You're not worth over $600,000.

00:20:20,473 --> 00:20:23,743
I don't think you can sell this
stuff at target at 7 bucks.

00:20:23,743 --> 00:20:25,278
That's my personal opinion.

00:20:25,278 --> 00:20:26,813
And the other issue for me

00:20:26,813 --> 00:20:28,982
is do I want pickles
in my portfolio?

00:20:28,982 --> 00:20:30,650
That's what I've been debating.
(Mark laughs)

00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,285
And I don't think
the answer's "yes" to that,

00:20:32,285 --> 00:20:34,020
so I'm out.

00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:42,062
Any other questions or concerns
we can address for you?

00:20:42,062 --> 00:20:43,964
I think you have two sharks
still left,

00:20:43,964 --> 00:20:45,565
and Barbara's a sucker
for people selling food

00:20:45,565 --> 00:20:47,033
in funny dresses.
I'm not a sucker at all.

00:20:47,033 --> 00:20:48,735
I'm a sucker for
a great entrepreneur,

00:20:48,735 --> 00:20:50,437
which obviously you both are.
Well, here's--
Here's what happens here.

00:20:50,437 --> 00:20:52,572
We started with
great-Grandma's secret recipe,

00:20:52,572 --> 00:20:54,441
and that was the passion
that started this business.

00:20:54,441 --> 00:20:55,875
No food background.

00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:56,977
No food background.

00:20:56,977 --> 00:20:58,533
We've grown so much
in the past two years.

00:20:58,533 --> 00:21:00,135
Our potential is unlimited.

00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:05,106
Aly, there's--There's no doubt
you guys have done a great job.

00:21:05,106 --> 00:21:08,176
But $7 for a jar of pickles?
Yeah--

00:21:08,176 --> 00:21:09,878
can I just reiterate

00:21:09,878 --> 00:21:12,947
that the average range
is $5.99 to $9.99

00:21:12,947 --> 00:21:14,816
for any specialty pickle?

00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:17,118
So I'm croatian.
Croatians love pickles.

00:21:17,118 --> 00:21:20,822
But very rare that they eat
sweet pickles.

00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:22,791
I'm--I'm not the right investor.

00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:25,393
I'm out.
All right, thank you.

00:21:25,393 --> 00:21:26,961
Barbara.

00:21:28,563 --> 00:21:30,732
(sighs)

00:21:30,732 --> 00:21:32,434
Couple of things.

00:21:32,434 --> 00:21:36,404
I think $144,000 in sales in
your first year is phenomenal.

00:21:36,404 --> 00:21:39,140
There are very few
young entrepreneurs

00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,542
that can make that claim.

00:21:40,542 --> 00:21:42,544
So you don't need
any help here.

00:21:42,544 --> 00:21:43,945
You're well on your road
to success,

00:21:43,945 --> 00:21:46,514
and you regret selling

00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:48,450
your chunk of your business
five years from now.

00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:51,186
I almost made that mistake once
selling half my business

00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:55,690
for $80,000, and thank god
that Investor changed his mind,

00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:58,326
'cause I sold it for $66 million
5 years later.

00:21:58,326 --> 00:22:01,029
I don't think you need
a partner, so I'm out.

00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:05,533
Great. Thank you.

Our company's Rolodoc,
and we're seeking

00:22:45,507 --> 00:22:47,775
$50,000 for 20% of our company.

00:22:47,775 --> 00:22:50,044
And as physicians,
we're constantly communicating

00:22:50,044 --> 00:22:51,346
with our peers, our patients,

00:22:51,346 --> 00:22:53,348
and with other
medical professionals.

00:22:53,348 --> 00:22:54,549
And what we've realized

00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:56,251
is that when it comes
to communication,

00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:58,486
medicine is not
in the 21st century.

00:22:58,486 --> 00:22:59,888
I mean, for crying out loud,

00:22:59,888 --> 00:23:01,890
we're still using pagers
to communicate.

00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,258
What is this, the '80s?

00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:06,327
Rolodoc is the cure
for the old school communication

00:23:06,327 --> 00:23:07,762
that exists in medicine.

00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:10,498
Rolodoc allows for secure
e-mail between patients,

00:23:10,498 --> 00:23:12,867
physicians,
and other medical professionals.

00:23:12,867 --> 00:23:16,104
The mobile app allows for
instant messaging between them.

00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:18,039
Take a look at this
sample patient profile.

00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:20,108
Here's Mr. Wonderful's page.

00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:23,511
He's entered in his information,
including his medical problems.

00:23:23,511 --> 00:23:25,580
He looks good.
It looks like he's suffering
from a heart condition--

00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,348
Acardia.
(laughs)

00:23:27,348 --> 00:23:30,318
For those non-medical nerds,
this is a condition

00:23:30,318 --> 00:23:33,021
when a person is literally born
without a heart.

00:23:33,021 --> 00:23:34,355
Not to worry, Mr. Wonderful,

00:23:34,355 --> 00:23:35,857
because you can then search
for physician by state,

00:23:35,857 --> 00:23:39,827
specialty, or insurance
provider. Let's pick surgery.

00:23:39,827 --> 00:23:42,397
Choosing surgery in Arizona
lets you find

00:23:42,397 --> 00:23:43,831
this young,
good-looking surgeon.

00:23:43,831 --> 00:23:47,468
You can then view his profile
and send him a message.

00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:49,737
The surgeon receives
the message Instantly

00:23:49,737 --> 00:23:51,439
and can reply
at his convenience.

00:23:51,439 --> 00:23:52,941
Sharks, with your investment,

00:23:52,941 --> 00:23:55,877
we will revolutionize the way
we communicate in medicine,

00:23:55,877 --> 00:23:58,780
but most importantly, you'll
help us get rid of these pagers

00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,148
and make some money
doing it.

00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:03,351
Is the point that you can
personally communicate

00:24:03,351 --> 00:24:06,054
to the doctors
that you have online?

00:24:06,054 --> 00:24:08,156
Because doctors
Could be inundated

00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:09,824
with e-Mails
and personal messages.

00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:11,559
How would they ever
keep up with it?

00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:14,095
What we're really trying to do
is bring social media

00:24:14,095 --> 00:24:16,965
and the social network
to the medical profession.

00:24:16,965 --> 00:24:18,533
What's the social element?
You didn't really say.

00:24:18,533 --> 00:24:21,336
So... you--Let's say--
Let's say

Kevin O'Leary moves to L.A.,

00:24:23,271 --> 00:24:24,906

00:24:24,906 --> 00:24:27,175
get even sexier than he is
already.

00:24:27,175 --> 00:24:29,043
I don't need that.
I look fantastic.
(laughter)

00:24:29,043 --> 00:24:32,413
(Albert) even sexier.
I'm gonna have a heart attack
listening to that nonsense.

00:24:32,413 --> 00:24:35,383
If he wants to go
find a doctor right now,

00:24:35,383 --> 00:24:37,218
he's gonna do a search engine.

00:24:37,218 --> 00:24:39,821
He's gonna be inundated
with inaccurate information,

00:24:39,821 --> 00:24:42,056
and he's really gonna be--
end up just as confused

00:24:42,056 --> 00:24:43,558
as when he started.

00:24:43,558 --> 00:24:44,726
Are you up and running
at all?

00:24:44,726 --> 00:24:46,928
We--we are in alpha testing
right now.

00:24:46,928 --> 00:24:48,463
We've got 50 users on it--

00:24:48,463 --> 00:24:50,265
Our personal connections
that are using it,

00:24:50,265 --> 00:24:51,699
verifying how it works,
how the--

00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:53,601
50 doctors
or just total users?

00:24:53,601 --> 00:24:54,736
Total users.

00:24:54,736 --> 00:24:56,738
(Kevin) I'm just looking
at my own situation.

00:24:56,738 --> 00:24:58,606
My doctor's in Boston.
When I have aches and pains

00:24:58,606 --> 00:25:02,543
and I'm on the road,
I can e-mail him as I do.

00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:03,845
He communicates back to me
that way

00:25:03,845 --> 00:25:06,047
and suggests that I go see
a specialist when I get home,

00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:07,582
all done by e-mail.

00:25:07,582 --> 00:25:11,719
The organization in Boston
which has my medical files

00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:13,888
shares them amongst hospitals.

00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:15,156
We've got that technology now.

00:25:15,156 --> 00:25:16,758
So when I arrive
at the specialist,

00:25:16,758 --> 00:25:18,826
they have all my history.
They know who I am.

00:25:18,826 --> 00:25:20,561
What are you adding
to that equation?

00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:22,096
So we're adding social media.

00:25:22,096 --> 00:25:26,067
Doctors wanna brand themselves,
wanna advertise.

00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:28,436
Just like you create a profile
on Rolodoc

00:25:28,436 --> 00:25:30,672
and create a profile
on another social network,

00:25:30,672 --> 00:25:32,540
but those social networks
aren't safe.

00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,676
You can't--You don't--
(Mark) Okay, wait.
Take a step back.

00:25:34,676 --> 00:25:36,177
How am I gonna convince you,

00:25:36,177 --> 00:25:38,780
the physician,
to put your profile up there

00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,948
and detail
the services that you offer?

00:25:40,948 --> 00:25:43,685
Well, that's easy. There's
800,000 U.S. Physicians--

00:25:43,685 --> 00:25:45,019
No, I didn't ask
what the market was.

00:25:45,019 --> 00:25:47,989
Okay.
There's a hundred places
to put profiles.

00:25:47,989 --> 00:25:52,026
What are you going to do
to convince doctors...

00:25:52,026 --> 00:25:53,461
just like you have
business connections,

00:25:53,461 --> 00:25:55,596
we have medical connections.
We're gonna launch in Arizona,

00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:58,633
texas, and chicago. Those are
where all our connections are.
Doing what? Doing what?

00:25:58,633 --> 00:26:00,835
We--we have access

00:26:00,835 --> 00:26:03,538
to multiple doctors,
multiple databases.

00:26:03,538 --> 00:26:05,273
We're gonna tell 'em
that this is the best way

00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:06,974
to brand yourself
in advertising.

00:26:06,974 --> 00:26:08,176
How are you going to
tell them?

00:26:08,176 --> 00:26:09,610
I'm pulling teeth.
I should be a dentist.

00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,512
Are you personally--
You're gonna quit your practice,

00:26:11,512 --> 00:26:14,449
you're gonna stop doing surgery,
and you're gonna make the call?

00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:17,151
No, this day and age,
we can do it with electronics.

00:26:17,151 --> 00:26:18,986
We can e-Mail--
(Lori) You can--

00:26:18,986 --> 00:26:20,421
buy a database?

00:26:20,421 --> 00:26:22,156
You know what, mark, though?
And send an e-Mail?

00:26:22,156 --> 00:26:23,758
This is dangerous. How are you
vetting these doctors?

00:26:23,758 --> 00:26:25,893
It's a valid concern, 'cause
you don't wanna be reading

00:26:25,893 --> 00:26:27,795
about somebody that actually
isn't a surgeon...

00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:29,931
right.
That's offering heart surgery.
That would be a bad outcome.

00:26:29,931 --> 00:26:31,566
Absolutely.
I don't think they're
gonna get anybody.

00:26:31,566 --> 00:26:34,001
It's not gonna be dangerous
if you can't get any doctors.

00:26:34,001 --> 00:26:36,637
Okay, let's go through
the logical progression.

00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:38,506
Yeah.
My doctor gets an e-mail.

00:26:38,506 --> 00:26:41,476
"Oh, it's from Rolodoc!"

00:26:42,944 --> 00:26:44,345
"Never heard of 'em."
Delete.

00:26:44,345 --> 00:26:46,247
(Kevin) Wait a second.

00:26:46,247 --> 00:26:49,217
You haven't explained
how I make money,

00:26:49,217 --> 00:26:51,319
which is
the most important thing.

00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:54,188
My doctor is very hip
to technology.

00:26:54,188 --> 00:26:56,557
Why would he use this,
and how would I profit

00:26:56,557 --> 00:26:58,393
from him actually
getting on board?

00:26:58,393 --> 00:26:59,560
He's gonna use this

00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,629
'cause he's gonna want
to attract new Patients,

00:27:01,629 --> 00:27:04,332
provide social media
to the medical field--
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, okay.

00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:06,167
You guys are driving me nuts.
Wait. Let him answer!
How do I make money?

00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:08,102
No, but he keeps on saying
"Social media, social media."

00:27:08,102 --> 00:27:10,037
This is all one-to-One
communication.

00:27:10,037 --> 00:27:12,573
You're not gonna let him
tell me how I make money.

00:27:12,573 --> 00:27:14,842
'cause there's no chance
of you making money on this.

00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:17,078
Do--is that the answer?

00:27:17,078 --> 00:27:19,247
Targeted advertising is how
you're gonna make your money.

00:27:19,247 --> 00:27:20,348
Within a secure environment,

00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:21,883
you're gonna do
targeted Advertising?

00:27:21,883 --> 00:27:23,985
Uh, not gonna happen.
Well, you can de--

00:27:23,985 --> 00:27:25,987
Look, there are social networks
that are already doing this

00:27:25,987 --> 00:27:28,489
for physician-only mobile--
Mobile networks.

00:27:28,489 --> 00:27:30,725
Within just
physician-to-physician...

00:27:30,725 --> 00:27:32,827
correct.
Which has a whole different
set of security issues

00:27:32,827 --> 00:27:34,796
than communicating
with patients.

00:27:34,796 --> 00:27:36,297
Correct.

00:27:36,297 --> 00:27:39,267
But you can target
the physicians.

00:27:39,267 --> 00:27:42,336
I see this as
a liability nightmare.

00:27:44,305 --> 00:27:46,274
Because you are putting
people in touch

00:27:46,274 --> 00:27:47,975
with their doctors.

00:27:47,975 --> 00:27:49,977
They're answering back without
maybe seeing a patient,

00:27:49,977 --> 00:27:51,245
knowing what's going on.

00:27:51,245 --> 00:27:52,880
This is just my opinion.

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,817
There's a lot of risk in it.
I'm out.

00:27:57,218 --> 00:27:59,320
What we're trying to do
is we're trying to bring

00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,456
social media to medicine.
And you--

00:28:01,456 --> 00:28:02,890
Albert, let me go back
to mark's point.
The current social network--

00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,058
You keep saying
"Social Media"...
Yeah.

00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:05,526
Then you go to e-mail.

00:28:05,526 --> 00:28:07,128
E-mail is not social media.

00:28:07,128 --> 00:28:09,997
Doctors are constantly
posting things

00:28:09,997 --> 00:28:12,300
on twitter
and on other web sites.

00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,101
And how do you use that?
Well, that's what we have.

00:28:14,101 --> 00:28:17,505
We have the capability
of being a social network.

00:28:17,505 --> 00:28:20,308
Instead of saying,
"Follow me on x-x site,"

00:28:20,308 --> 00:28:21,909
you say,
"Follow me on Rolodoc."

00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:24,011
I get that you're trying
to recreate twitter

00:28:24,011 --> 00:28:26,747
and facebook on to Rolodoc.
Correct.

00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:28,583
Okay, but I want to do this
eye-to-eye, face-to-face,

00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:30,218
'cause you're doctors.

00:28:33,588 --> 00:28:36,257
Worst presentation ever.
I'm out.

00:28:36,257 --> 00:28:37,658
(Robert) Oh, that was mean.

00:28:37,658 --> 00:28:40,828
Ever. You guys should be
smart enough to know.

00:28:40,828 --> 00:28:42,530
You didn't show us
any of the social media.

00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:44,665
You showed us profiles
and talked to us about e-mail.

00:28:44,665 --> 00:28:46,133
You didn't tell us at all
how you were gonna get there.

00:28:46,133 --> 00:28:47,568
It was horrible.

00:28:47,568 --> 00:28:49,303
(Robert) Mark, I just think
you're being a bully.

00:28:49,303 --> 00:28:50,872
I mean, they might be
misguided--
Okay, I am being a bully.

00:28:50,872 --> 00:28:52,807
Then they deserve
to be bullied.

00:28:52,807 --> 00:28:55,443
(Barbara) It's hurtful
to watch you.

00:28:55,443 --> 00:28:56,744
I would have to agree with mark.

00:28:56,744 --> 00:29:00,047
I think it was the worst
sales presentation I've heard.

00:29:00,047 --> 00:29:01,782
We're not presenters, okay?

00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:04,585
We're physicians, so--
But guess what.

00:29:04,585 --> 00:29:06,020
I don't care
what your background is.

00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,989
If you're looking for money,
you got to sell your idea.

00:29:07,989 --> 00:29:10,625
That business plan
is so unclear,

00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:11,826
I'm out.

00:29:11,826 --> 00:29:13,694
(Robert) With all due respect,

00:29:13,694 --> 00:29:15,463
I just don't think
you've explained

00:29:15,463 --> 00:29:18,900
how you're gonna get users,
how you're gonna monetize it.

00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,801
I just don't see the business.

00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:23,337

(Kevin) I was intrigued.

00:29:24,739 --> 00:29:26,641
Frankly, it's depressing,

00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:29,710
'cause I like new ideas
in the medical space.

They're forever if they work.

00:29:31,779 --> 00:29:33,948

I can't connect the dots

00:33:03,809 --> 00:33:06,278
in this kind of
retail environment before?

00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:09,615

food product, uh, category, yes.

00:33:21,494 --> 00:33:22,862
the right partnership

00:33:22,862 --> 00:33:24,630

the capital that we needed

00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,899
to help grow the business.
So you got burned
along the way, maybe,

00:33:26,899 --> 00:33:28,868
learned some lessons--
which is a good thing.

00:33:28,868 --> 00:33:30,603

Why are you here?

00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,669
Because for us,
it's about growth.

00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:05,905
Right now one of the things
we have is a 21-Day turnaround.

00:34:05,905 --> 00:34:07,573
The $250,000 would be used
to offset

00:34:07,573 --> 00:34:09,708
some of our inventory needs
so that we could get away

00:34:09,708 --> 00:34:11,377
from that 21-day lead time,

00:34:11,377 --> 00:34:13,445
'cause some of the retailers
that we've talked to right now

00:34:13,445 --> 00:34:15,915
want to be able to turn it
faster than 21 days.

00:34:15,915 --> 00:34:19,518
So you're asking for $250,000
for 25%?

00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:22,221
For 10% of the company.

00:34:22,221 --> 00:34:23,689
(laughter)
(Kevin) Yeah--

00:34:23,689 --> 00:34:25,157
Here's what's wrong
with the 10%--

00:34:25,157 --> 00:34:26,692
Nobody gets excited
about 10%.

00:34:26,692 --> 00:34:28,961
Understood.
Nobody's interested in 10%.

00:34:28,961 --> 00:34:31,230
What, uh... what would
get you interested?

00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,666
Oh, big numbers. 80%, 90%.
(laughing)

00:34:33,666 --> 00:34:35,768
Oh, yeah.
That works for me, too.

00:34:35,768 --> 00:34:38,404
Is that your offer, Barbara?
$250,000 for 90%?
(Lori) 90%?

00:34:38,404 --> 00:34:39,705
Hey, I'll give you an offer.

00:34:39,705 --> 00:34:42,474
I'll give you $250,000
for 40%.

00:34:42,474 --> 00:34:44,143
Ba-Bam!
Okay.

00:34:44,143 --> 00:34:46,111
Thank you for the offer, too.

00:34:46,111 --> 00:34:47,847
(laughs)
(Robert)
Ah, very nice, James.

00:34:47,847 --> 00:34:49,248
Well, it's not--You know,
not saying it's, you know,

00:34:49,248 --> 00:34:51,217
directly no, but thank you
for the offer.

00:34:51,217 --> 00:34:52,651
Do you guys want
to consult on that?
Well...

00:34:52,651 --> 00:34:54,820
(laughter)
Or the--hopefully
there's, uh,

00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,622
at least one other offer
out there.

00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,859
Have you paid yourself
anything?
Uh, we have.

00:34:59,859 --> 00:35:02,628
We've taken a distribution.
How big is your distribution?

00:35:02,628 --> 00:35:07,800
Uh, amounts to roughly
$2,500, $3,000 a month.

00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,535
(Kevin) I like it,
'cause it's close to a space

00:35:09,535 --> 00:35:10,903
I'm very involved in now,

00:35:10,903 --> 00:35:12,705
particularly the commercial
kitchen logistics side.

00:35:12,705 --> 00:35:14,106
Wicked Good Cupcakes--

00:35:14,106 --> 00:35:15,641
We're making a lot of money
in that company.

00:35:15,641 --> 00:35:18,711
I'll do the $250,000 for 30%,

00:35:18,711 --> 00:35:20,579
but here is the covenant
that I'm gonna put on it,

00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:23,182
because I'm concerned in all
the food deals I've ever done

00:35:23,182 --> 00:35:25,117
in getting my capital back
before I die.

00:35:25,117 --> 00:35:27,686
Sure.
So when you make
a distribution,

00:35:27,686 --> 00:35:30,723
I get one, too--
Dollar for dollar.

00:35:30,723 --> 00:35:33,058
So I'm just like a partner
that started at the top,

00:35:33,058 --> 00:35:34,960
except I paid a whole lot more
for it.

00:35:36,395 --> 00:35:38,063
We-We'd like to also know,
like, which retailer

00:35:38,063 --> 00:35:39,665
you--You have
relationships at

00:35:39,665 --> 00:35:41,000
that you could also help us
get into.

00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,335
I can call any retailer
and get my call returned.

00:35:43,335 --> 00:35:45,137
Well, that's not necessarily so.
What I--what I've learned--
what I've learned

00:35:45,137 --> 00:35:47,640
about this business--
That's not always true
of him.

00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,408
What I've learned about
this business--
"Hi, it's Kevin O'Leary."

00:35:49,408 --> 00:35:51,076
Click.
(chuckles)

00:35:51,076 --> 00:35:54,179
I like Kevin's offer...

00:35:54,179 --> 00:35:55,614
except--

00:35:55,614 --> 00:35:57,483
There's one problem.
You don't like Kevin.

00:35:57,483 --> 00:35:59,385
(laughs)
I like Kevin a lot.

00:35:59,385 --> 00:36:02,187
Well, I don't like Kevin,
so I'll just admit it.
I like Kevin's offer,

00:36:02,187 --> 00:36:05,124
but I'm going to change it
a little bit.
Okay.

00:36:05,124 --> 00:36:08,227
$250,000 for 36%

00:36:08,227 --> 00:36:11,463
and the same distribution
that Kevin offered.

00:36:11,463 --> 00:36:14,566
But I'm bringing with me
not only retail,

00:36:14,566 --> 00:36:16,468
which I'm known
for lightning speed...

00:36:16,468 --> 00:36:18,837
absolutely.
But I also bring with me qvc.

00:36:18,837 --> 00:36:20,506
And...
I've got good news for you.

00:36:20,506 --> 00:36:23,475
I'll keep my offer--
I can do hundreds
of thousands of dollars

00:36:23,475 --> 00:36:25,411
in minutes.
Right.

00:36:25,411 --> 00:36:27,379
We'll call in, and they will--
anybody that's got a product
that can sell...

00:36:27,379 --> 00:36:28,981
You know what?
Can sell it on qvc.

00:36:28,981 --> 00:36:31,283
I would agree with that.
Yes, and you know how many
people last?

00:36:31,283 --> 00:36:33,619
Very few.
I will tell you--

00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:36,622
to survive on qvc
is a very tricky thing.

00:36:36,622 --> 00:36:38,390
You have to really
know what you're doing.
Mm-hmm.

00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:40,159
As Barbara will attest to.

00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:41,727
I'll attest to it, but let me
tell you something.

00:36:41,727 --> 00:36:44,430
It's only in adjunct sales.
Right.

00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:46,031
It's not the main deal.
Sure.

00:36:46,031 --> 00:36:48,067
You've got the main deal.
It's free advertising

00:36:48,067 --> 00:36:50,302
and great sales.
It's free advertising,
and the theory is,

00:36:50,302 --> 00:36:52,805
is that it drives other sales,
and I have found

00:36:52,805 --> 00:36:55,641
in testing that theory
there's no truth to it.
Oh, that's not True at all.

00:36:55,641 --> 00:36:58,277
James, when you have Lori
and Barbara on the panel...
Wait, wait, wait.

00:36:58,277 --> 00:37:00,079
I c--
You can't get a word in
edgewise.

00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,981
(laughter)

00:37:01,981 --> 00:37:06,919
So, James, I'll give you
the $250,000 for 25%.

00:37:08,454 --> 00:37:11,857
And I-I don't need a royalty
or anything along the way.

00:37:11,857 --> 00:37:13,692
I mean, my gosh,
you've done a million dollars

00:37:13,692 --> 00:37:16,028
in your first year in sales.

00:37:16,028 --> 00:37:17,429
Let me come along
for that ride.

00:37:17,429 --> 00:37:18,564
Okay.
Thank you.

00:37:18,564 --> 00:37:20,032
Robert, and I'm sure
you bring a retailer

00:37:20,032 --> 00:37:21,767
to the table as well, from--
I can certainly bring costco,

00:37:21,767 --> 00:37:23,969
but, you know, frankly,
I'm sure everybody here could.

00:37:23,969 --> 00:37:27,773
But I'm not investing
in my retail strategy.
(James) Mm-hmm.

00:37:27,773 --> 00:37:29,675
I'm investing
in the two of you guys.

00:37:29,675 --> 00:37:31,276
Mm-hmm.
(Lori) You need a shark

00:37:31,276 --> 00:37:33,779
that knows how to keep you
in the retailer.

00:37:33,779 --> 00:37:36,382
Because it's--We can get in,
we can break down the door.

00:37:36,382 --> 00:37:38,684
Some of us, I think
more doors than others.

00:37:38,684 --> 00:37:40,152
Don't sell yourself short.
But--No.

00:37:40,152 --> 00:37:41,920
(Lori) I think
some more than others.

00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,989
But you also have to think
about who--What strategic

00:37:43,989 --> 00:37:45,491
partner do you want.
(lowered voice)
I like these guys,

00:37:45,491 --> 00:37:47,092
but I don't know the cake
and Candy business like you do.

00:37:47,092 --> 00:37:49,028
Is it somebody who has
a lot of experience,

00:37:49,028 --> 00:37:51,263
creativity, can get you
into a lot of stores?

00:37:51,263 --> 00:37:52,498
You're making me blush.
Stop.

00:37:52,498 --> 00:37:54,099
No, I mean--
(laughter)

00:37:54,099 --> 00:37:56,969
You know, you have to think
about it in your gut.
Sure.

00:37:56,969 --> 00:37:59,138
Well, let me ask one question.
Mark...

00:37:59,138 --> 00:38:02,274
um, is there a potential
for an offer on the table?

00:38:02,274 --> 00:38:03,809
Yeah, I'm interested.

00:38:03,809 --> 00:38:07,046
I think I'd rather have
a strategic partner with me...

00:38:07,046 --> 00:38:08,480
sure.
Than do it on my own.

00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,883
So I'd like to work
with Barbara.

00:38:12,317 --> 00:38:14,353
Um, I like
Barbara's experience there.

00:38:14,353 --> 00:38:16,955
Barbara, you had some ideas
on what you wanted to do,

00:38:16,955 --> 00:38:19,558
so fire away.
Yeah, I had offered you 40%,

00:38:19,558 --> 00:38:22,628
and I obviously know
I've been out-Priced here.

00:38:22,628 --> 00:38:25,130
I'm gonna adjust my offer,
but I have a feeling

00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:26,932
that I'm working with
a generous partner here,

00:38:26,932 --> 00:38:28,634
and I'm afraid--
and so keep your mouth shut.

00:38:28,634 --> 00:38:30,369
I always pay--they say I overpay
all the time.
Keep your mouth shut.

00:38:30,369 --> 00:38:32,204
What are you gonna say?
He overpays, all right?

00:38:32,204 --> 00:38:34,573
I'll adjust the offer
to 33%,

00:38:34,573 --> 00:38:37,076
because the truth
of the matter is--
That's not what we discussed.

00:38:37,076 --> 00:38:40,279
The offer is 25%. Right?
Thirty--
Wait, wait, wait.

00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:42,181
No, we didn't agree on 25%.
Yes, we did. Yes, we did.

00:38:42,181 --> 00:38:44,049
No, we didn't.
I said I'd think about it.
Whoa. You--

00:38:44,049 --> 00:38:45,651
do you want two partners
can't even agree

00:38:45,651 --> 00:38:47,386
on the offer?
He just
thought about it.

00:38:47,386 --> 00:38:49,088
Think about it.
(Barbara)
No, I didn't want to do that.

00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,622
(Mark) You didn't want
to do 25%?
This is really interesting.

00:38:50,622 --> 00:38:52,024
(Barbara) No. All right, 30%,
all right.

00:38:52,024 --> 00:38:54,126
I'm going along with him
'cause he's so damn pushy.

00:38:54,126 --> 00:38:57,663
Okay, I'll agree to $250,000
for your 25%.

00:38:57,663 --> 00:39:00,466
(Robert) 25%. So you've got
an offer from Barbara and mark

00:39:00,466 --> 00:39:02,734
for $250,000 for 25%,

00:39:02,734 --> 00:39:05,137
so would you agree with me
there's value

00:39:05,137 --> 00:39:07,339
in having more than one shark
in the deal?

00:39:07,339 --> 00:39:08,807
Absolutely.
Yes.

00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:11,443
All right, well, what if you
had three sharks

00:39:11,443 --> 00:39:13,278
with the same offer?

00:39:15,314 --> 00:39:19,118
♪♪

00:39:21,019 --> 00:39:23,489
♪♪

00:39:23,489 --> 00:39:26,692
All the sharks
have offers on the table,

00:39:26,692 --> 00:39:30,429
but Robert senses he may need
to collude with Lori and Kevin

00:39:30,429 --> 00:39:33,198
in order to compete with
an offer from Mark and Barbara.

00:39:33,198 --> 00:39:35,267
So you've got an offer
from Barbara and mark

00:39:35,267 --> 00:39:37,769
for $250,000 for 25%.

00:39:37,769 --> 00:39:40,739
So what if you had three sharks
with the same offer?

00:39:42,608 --> 00:39:47,346
I'm willing to work
with Lori and that Kevin guy.

00:39:47,346 --> 00:39:49,248
I think three sharks are
worth more than two.
Kevin's the only guy

00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:52,117
that's actually done
one of these deals.
I like it. I like it.

00:39:52,117 --> 00:39:53,252
But I'm willing
to match this offer

00:39:53,252 --> 00:39:54,686
if these guys come in with me--

00:39:54,686 --> 00:39:57,322
$250,000 for 25%,

00:39:57,322 --> 00:39:59,591
and we get the same
distribution.

00:39:59,591 --> 00:40:02,561
I think I can bring you retail
that you don't have today.

00:40:02,561 --> 00:40:04,530
I definitely can.
I think she can bring you
another channel.

00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:07,499
And... Kevin adds value.

00:40:07,499 --> 00:40:09,168
(laughter)

00:40:09,168 --> 00:40:11,203
How original.

00:40:11,203 --> 00:40:13,238
(Kevin) I think
you have to adjust it.

00:40:13,238 --> 00:40:14,640
I'll tell you why.
You got three sharks here.

00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,308
We should get 10% each
at least.

00:40:16,308 --> 00:40:18,644
So are--is--are these
the final offers on the table?

00:40:18,644 --> 00:40:20,379
(Robert) All right,
$250,000.
Okay.

00:40:20,379 --> 00:40:21,413
We're at 30%.
For 30%.

00:40:21,413 --> 00:40:22,748
(Cole) okay.
They're at 25%.

00:40:22,748 --> 00:40:24,283
(Robert) same distribution.
You get three sharks,

00:40:24,283 --> 00:40:25,617
two sharks.
Same distribution.

00:40:25,617 --> 00:40:27,953
And everybody has connections.
The more sharks you have,

00:40:27,953 --> 00:40:30,155
the more connections you get.
It's that simple.

00:40:32,925 --> 00:40:34,593
And in reality,
the differentiation is,

00:40:34,593 --> 00:40:36,195
they're not gonna walk you
into theater chains,

00:40:36,195 --> 00:40:39,898
they're not gonna walk you
into food service for arenas

00:40:39,898 --> 00:40:41,300
and for stadiums.
Well, yes, we are.

00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,001
I'm not sure that's true.
Because we're gonna
walk you...

00:40:43,001 --> 00:40:45,170
that's ridiculous.
Into any chain that they
can walk you into.

00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:47,372
When I have something that we
want to have sold in our arena,

00:40:47,372 --> 00:40:48,941
we say, "Sell this."

00:40:48,941 --> 00:40:51,243
when I have something that we
want sold in my theaters,

00:40:51,243 --> 00:40:52,911
I say, "Sell this."

00:40:52,911 --> 00:40:54,313
and that's great, except--
but--

00:40:54,313 --> 00:40:56,014
That's great for one Arena.
That's great--Yeah.

00:40:56,014 --> 00:40:57,749
I think there's more Arenas--
That's 5% of the market.

00:40:57,749 --> 00:41:00,752
And you need
really great advertising.

00:41:00,752 --> 00:41:03,855
And I will tell you,
regardless of what Barbara said,

00:41:03,855 --> 00:41:06,825
I know from 17 years
of experience

00:41:06,825 --> 00:41:10,862
that absolutely people are dying
to get on qvc

00:41:10,862 --> 00:41:13,232
for publicity alone.

00:41:13,232 --> 00:41:17,536
Qvc is lights, cameras,
customers--like that.

00:41:17,536 --> 00:41:18,870
(Kevin) You've got every shark.

00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,138
This is so rare
in the shark tank,

00:41:20,138 --> 00:41:21,940
where you got everybody
involved.

00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,843
♪♪

00:41:24,843 --> 00:41:27,246
Three is better than two.

00:41:29,314 --> 00:41:31,149
What are you going to do?

00:41:31,149 --> 00:41:34,152
♪♪

00:41:34,152 --> 00:41:35,554
In a perfect world,

00:41:35,554 --> 00:41:37,089
we'd love to be
partners with all you guys,

00:41:37,089 --> 00:41:38,557
'cause you all bring
so much to the table.

00:41:38,557 --> 00:41:39,725
Y'all really are great.

00:41:43,061 --> 00:41:44,363
Kevin, Lori, Robert...

00:41:46,298 --> 00:41:48,333
think it's
a fantastic opportunity

00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:49,635
knowing what you bring
to the table,

00:41:49,635 --> 00:41:50,769
but I think as of today,

00:41:50,769 --> 00:41:51,970
we'll have to go
with Mark and Barbara.

00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,272
Oh!
Yes, sir!

00:41:53,272 --> 00:41:54,606
(Barbara) Yes!
Sweet Ballz fans for life!

00:41:54,606 --> 00:41:56,575
Yes, sir!
F.F.L., baby! (laughing)

00:41:56,575 --> 00:41:58,010
Appreciate it.

00:41:58,010 --> 00:41:59,678
You're a smart guy.
Thank you.

00:41:59,678 --> 00:42:01,246
I could feel the ballz
slipping away.
(Barbara) Pleasure...

00:42:01,246 --> 00:42:02,981
Appreciate it, ma'am.
Congratulations, guys.

00:42:02,981 --> 00:42:04,383
Blah, blah, blah, blah!
Thank you, guys.

00:42:04,383 --> 00:42:06,051
Thank you, thank you.
(laughter)

00:42:06,051 --> 00:42:07,853
(Robert) Nice job.
(whispers) Yes, sir!

00:42:07,853 --> 00:42:11,023
Was there ever a doubt?
I'm very surprised.
I think they made a mistake.

00:42:11,023 --> 00:42:14,026
Yeow! Yes, sir!

00:42:14,026 --> 00:42:16,561
Sweet Ballz
coming to A.A.C., baby!

00:42:16,561 --> 00:42:18,430
Let's go! That's what
I'm talking about!

00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:21,033
Excuse me. Who's hot?
Who's hot?
(laughing)

00:42:21,033 --> 00:42:22,968
Who's hot? Who's hot?

00:42:22,968 --> 00:42:24,102
(Lori speaks indistinctly)
Who's hot?

00:42:24,102 --> 00:42:25,370
(Kevin) I think--
Who's hot?

00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:26,538
Lord...
