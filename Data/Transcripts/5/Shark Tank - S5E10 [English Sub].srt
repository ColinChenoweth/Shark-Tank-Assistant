00:00:01,403 --> 00:00:03,006
Narrator:
  This is the "Shark Tank"

00:00:03,006 --> 00:00:04,343
Where hopeful entrepreneurs

00:00:04,343 --> 00:00:06,815
get a once-in-a-Lifetime chance
  to pitch the sharks

00:00:06,815 --> 00:00:08,585
in hopes
  of getting an investment

00:00:08,585 --> 00:00:11,191
to start, grow,
  or save their businesses.

00:00:11,191 --> 00:00:13,362
We did $1.125 million
  in sales.

00:00:13,362 --> 00:00:14,698
Herjavec: Whoa!
  O'Leary: Wow!

00:00:14,698 --> 00:00:17,303
Narrator: The entrepreneurs
  must convince a shark

00:00:17,303 --> 00:00:19,174
to invest the full amount
  they're asking for,

00:00:19,174 --> 00:00:20,510
or they'll walk away
  with nothing.

00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,651
The idea of it
  is so wrong, I'm out.

00:00:23,651 --> 00:00:24,986
Let me -- Let me just stop you
  right there.

00:00:24,986 --> 00:00:26,423
You can't stop him
  if he's out.

00:00:27,659 --> 00:00:30,498
Narrator: If the sharks
  hear a great idea...
  this tastes great.

00:00:30,498 --> 00:00:33,371
...they're ready to invest
  using their own money.

00:00:33,371 --> 00:00:35,742
I was going to ignore you
  completely,

00:00:35,742 --> 00:00:38,048
but now I'm Loving you.

00:00:38,048 --> 00:00:41,488
That's a first. He tried
  to steal Someone's employee.

00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:42,924
Narrator: And they're willing
  to fight each other

00:00:42,924 --> 00:00:44,428
for a piece of the action.

00:00:44,428 --> 00:00:46,031
What I can do for you
  is take you to retail.

00:00:46,031 --> 00:00:47,969
Well, I'll make it
  even more interesting.

00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:50,841
What do you say?
  Can I ask you
  a few more questions?

00:00:52,278 --> 00:00:54,650
Don't mistake my kindness
  for weakness.

00:00:57,489 --> 00:00:58,958
Narrator:
  Who are the sharks?

00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:02,099
They're self-Made millionaire
  and billionaire investors

00:01:02,099 --> 00:01:05,640
who are entrepreneurs
  themselves.

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,278
Kevin O'Leary
  is a venture capitalist

00:01:08,278 --> 00:01:10,182
who turned a $10,000 loan

00:01:10,182 --> 00:01:14,392
into a software business
  worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:16,429 --> 00:01:19,636
Barbara Corcoran went from
  waiting tables in manhattan

00:01:19,636 --> 00:01:22,542
to building the city's
  preeminent real-Estate empire.

00:01:24,346 --> 00:01:27,085
Robert herjavec, the son
  of an immigrant factory worker,

00:01:27,085 --> 00:01:29,223
is now a technology mogul

00:01:29,223 --> 00:01:33,766
Who sold his first internet
  companies for over $350 million.

00:01:34,601 --> 00:01:38,810
Lori Greiner, the queen of qvc,
  holds over 100 patents,

00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,048
and has launched
  over 300 products

00:01:41,048 --> 00:01:44,823
grossing over a half a billion
  dollars in retail sales.

And mark cuban -- Notorious
  billionaire entrepreneur,

00:01:50,635 --> 00:02:02,193
of the Nba's Dallas mavericks.

00:02:02,193 --> 00:02:06,301
First into the tank is a couple
  from san Ramon, california,

00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:09,275
with a better solution
  to a school-Day dilemma.

00:02:14,018 --> 00:02:17,024
Hi, sharks.
  I'm Cyndi.
  And I'm Paul.

00:02:17,024 --> 00:02:21,400
And we're here today seeking
  $150,000 investment

00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,576
in exchange for 15%
  of our lunch-Box company, yubo.

[ bell rings ]

00:02:26,711 --> 00:02:28,850
lunchtime!
  Lunchtime!

00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,487
It all started
  four years ago.

00:02:30,487 --> 00:02:33,226
As the proud parents
  of two beautiful, little girls,

00:02:33,226 --> 00:02:34,562
we'd send them to school

00:02:34,562 --> 00:02:36,800
with your typical
  fabric lunch box

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,804
filled with
  Those plastic baggies

00:02:38,804 --> 00:02:42,712
and "Personalized" With a
  permanent Marker on the outside.

00:02:42,712 --> 00:02:47,188
We were going through nearly
  2,000 plastic baggies a year,

00:02:47,188 --> 00:02:48,959
not to mention
  these lunch boxes

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,634
would come home
  completely nasty.

00:02:52,634 --> 00:02:55,105
They were
  not dishwasher-Safe,

00:02:55,105 --> 00:02:57,544
so I would do my best
  to wipe it down.

00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,514
And, oh,
  it was clean, right?

00:02:59,514 --> 00:03:00,651
Wrong!
  Wrong!

00:03:00,651 --> 00:03:02,655
[ Laughs ]
  We looked everywhere

00:03:02,655 --> 00:03:05,728
for a lunch box that was easy to
  clean, good for the environment,

00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:07,966
and we couldn't find it,
  so we created yubo.

00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:11,574
Yubo is
  the only lunch box

00:03:11,574 --> 00:03:13,611
Where kids can create
  their own designs

00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:17,019
and change them out
  whenever their tastes change

00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:19,624
so you don't have to buy
  a whole new lunch box.

00:03:19,624 --> 00:03:21,395
You just pop in
  a new design.

00:03:21,395 --> 00:03:23,065
You have
  a whole new look.

00:03:23,065 --> 00:03:26,171
And if you spill yogurt
  or crumbs, it's not a problem.

00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:29,278
Just rinse it out in the sink
  or throw it in the dishwasher.

00:03:29,278 --> 00:03:31,449
Yubo comes with a set
  of reusable fruit containers

00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:34,255
and a custom-Fit ice pack
  so food stays fresh.

00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,860
We made you custom yubos.

00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,531
All you do is --
  HERJAVEC: Oh, very cool.

00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:40,535
See if you can
  recognize yourself.

00:03:40,535 --> 00:03:41,504
Oh, oh!
  [ laughs ]

00:03:41,504 --> 00:03:43,809
they're simple to open.

00:03:43,809 --> 00:03:45,346
Just hold on the middle
  and grab on any corner.
  Thank you.

00:03:45,346 --> 00:03:47,116
Cyndi: Barbara.
  Corcoran: Ah! Great.

00:03:47,116 --> 00:03:49,053
And when you want
  to close it back up,

00:03:49,053 --> 00:03:51,692
just push on All four corners --
  Super-Simple.

00:03:51,692 --> 00:03:52,594
Cute, right?

00:03:52,594 --> 00:03:54,665
So come on, sharks.

00:03:54,665 --> 00:03:55,868
Let's do lunch!
  Let's do lunch!

00:03:59,275 --> 00:04:01,246
PAUL: So, you'll notice
  there's no hinges.

00:04:01,246 --> 00:04:03,217
There's no zippers
  to break.

00:04:03,217 --> 00:04:05,021
Super-Simple.
  Open and close.

00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:06,657
Great job.

00:04:06,657 --> 00:04:09,063
Herjavec: Very clever.
  Thank you.
  Thank you.

00:04:09,063 --> 00:04:11,034
Are these add-Ons,
  or do these come with it?

00:04:11,034 --> 00:04:11,935
We have two models.

00:04:11,935 --> 00:04:13,439
We have
  our basic lunch box,

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,078
which comes empty
  at a lower price point.

00:04:16,078 --> 00:04:18,082
And what's that price point?
  This is -- $21.95.

00:04:18,082 --> 00:04:19,484
And then we have
  our deluxe model

00:04:19,484 --> 00:04:21,623
that comes with
  what you see there,

00:04:21,623 --> 00:04:23,660
and that can retail
  anywhere from $30

00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,297
for no personalization
  on it

00:04:25,297 --> 00:04:26,599
or up to $40 when you want
  to personalize it.

00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,803
When you think about something
  like this,

00:04:27,803 --> 00:04:29,773
I mean, you think about how easy
  this is to come apart,

00:04:29,773 --> 00:04:32,546
that's why this type of a design
  is so amazing.

00:04:32,546 --> 00:04:35,619
You could take it apart
  and put it in the dishwasher.
  Exactly.

00:04:35,619 --> 00:04:37,289
That -- That's one of the unique
  selling attributes.

00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:38,659
Absolutely.
  Correct.

00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:40,029
Paul, I think it's very clever,
  'cause they get filthy.

00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,465
That's what I think is
  so smart about it.

00:04:41,465 --> 00:04:42,668
Right.
  Right.
  They get gross.

00:04:42,668 --> 00:04:45,172
Great presentation,
  great name, great design.

00:04:45,172 --> 00:04:47,177
Thank you.
  Thank you.

00:04:47,177 --> 00:04:50,718
I got to believe that
  you're now at the cusp
  of going to retail,

00:04:50,718 --> 00:04:52,555
'cause you know
  you got to get it there.
  Absolutely, absolutely.
  Absolutely.

00:04:52,555 --> 00:04:55,026
I think most Moms Buy
  lunch boxes

00:04:55,026 --> 00:04:57,665
when they're walking down
  the aisle, see it, and say,

00:04:57,665 --> 00:04:59,402
"Need a lunch box."
  Absolutely.

00:04:59,402 --> 00:05:02,343
We have about 100 retail stores
  across the nation.

00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,447
We also are sold
  internationally.

00:05:04,447 --> 00:05:06,317
We have a handful
  of international distributors.

00:05:06,317 --> 00:05:08,923
Corcoran: Cyndi, what does
  a typical lunch box sell for?

00:05:08,923 --> 00:05:10,460
$15, $20.

00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,297
So, how long have you been
  selling? How many have you sold?

00:05:12,297 --> 00:05:13,800
We've been on the market
  for four years.

00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,706
This year, we're on track
  to do about

00:05:16,706 --> 00:05:18,844
between $200,000
  and $250,000.
  Wow.

00:05:18,844 --> 00:05:20,781
Greiner: do you have a patent
  on this?
  We do. Two patents.

00:05:20,781 --> 00:05:23,555
We own a design patent
  and a utility patent.

00:05:23,555 --> 00:05:25,090
We own
  our yubo trademark.

00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,561
And our vision
  for the company

00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:30,736
not only is to expand in the
  channels that we're already in,

00:05:30,736 --> 00:05:32,239
but I have another vision.

00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:34,377
So, Barbara,
  I know you have a daughter.

00:05:34,377 --> 00:05:36,715
Let's think back
  to when she was Younger

00:05:36,715 --> 00:05:37,985
and you took her

00:05:37,985 --> 00:05:40,424
to the happiest place on earth
  for the first time,

00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:42,228
to the amusement park
  we all know.

00:05:42,228 --> 00:05:44,699
She's filled
  with excitement.

00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:48,841
She meets her favorite Princess
  for the very first time,

00:05:48,841 --> 00:05:50,645
and somebody photographs
  that moment.

00:05:50,645 --> 00:05:54,119
Imagine that photograph
  is waiting for her

00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:57,560
on her lunch box
  in that gift shop.
  Mm.

00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,230
Do you have that deal
  in place?

00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,802
That's why we're here.
  We do not.
  We do not have that deal
  in place.

00:06:01,802 --> 00:06:03,740
So...
  we would love to have that deal
  in place.

00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,243
Did you design this yourself?

00:06:05,243 --> 00:06:07,481
He and I came up with the idea
  together.

00:06:07,481 --> 00:06:09,385
So, how much money
  did you have to put out?

00:06:09,385 --> 00:06:13,761
We have invested in Total about
  $350,000 of our own money.

00:06:16,868 --> 00:06:19,907
With our industrial designer,
  we didn't have the cash

00:06:19,907 --> 00:06:23,581
to pay what he would naturally
  charge up front.

00:06:23,581 --> 00:06:25,185
We had no sales.
  We had no product.
  Greiner:
  You gave him a piece.

00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:27,022
We gave him a piece.
  Absolutely.
  Cuban: That's okay.

00:06:27,022 --> 00:06:28,392
That's okay.
  How much did you give him?
  How much did you give him?

00:06:28,392 --> 00:06:29,795
He owns 20% of our company.
  We own 80%.

00:06:29,795 --> 00:06:31,699
And he has a royalty,
  to be clear.

00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:33,302
Oh.

00:06:33,302 --> 00:06:36,108
How much is the royalty?
  He has a 5% to 1%.

00:06:36,108 --> 00:06:38,847
It's a sliding scale
  based on the units sold.

00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,684
I think
  he's Kevin's cousin.
  Ah.

00:06:40,684 --> 00:06:42,321
Yes.
  And is that in Perpetuity?

00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:43,758
Uh, it is.
  It is.

00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,637
So, when -- When would it
  drop down to 1%?

00:06:49,637 --> 00:06:52,209
750,000 units.

00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:55,216
But it's 5% of the cost
  of the unit.

00:06:55,216 --> 00:06:56,385
It's 5% of sales.

00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,227
Oh.

00:07:00,227 --> 00:07:03,199
Net sales.

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,201
Net sales.
  Mm-hmm.

00:07:04,201 --> 00:07:07,509
Wow.
  That's steep. Ooh.

00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:09,312
We wouldn't be here today
  if we didn't do that,

00:07:09,312 --> 00:07:11,417
so we're very satisfied
  with that deal.

00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:12,953
Cuban:
  Guys, guys, I got to tell you,

00:07:12,953 --> 00:07:14,957
this is such
  a competitive industry.
  Mm-hmm.

00:07:14,957 --> 00:07:17,263
I mean,
  you said you invested 350k.
  Mm-hmm.

00:07:17,263 --> 00:07:18,765
And your sales are nowhere
  near that.

00:07:18,765 --> 00:07:19,768
Mm-hmm.

00:07:19,768 --> 00:07:21,204
The idea
  of a perpetual royalty

00:07:21,204 --> 00:07:22,841
I think is so wrong,
  I'm out.

00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:26,917
Let me -- Let me just stop you
  right there.

00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:29,522
So, mark --
  You can't stop him
  if he's out.

00:07:30,591 --> 00:07:34,566
Cyndi, let me tell you
  what I object to on this.

00:07:34,566 --> 00:07:37,506
This is rather large,

00:07:37,506 --> 00:07:40,645
so I could not put this
  in her backpack.

00:07:40,645 --> 00:07:42,649
It wouldn't fit.
  Okay.

00:07:42,649 --> 00:07:45,088
And I find that to be
  a problem.
  Okay.

00:07:45,088 --> 00:07:46,992
I think
  it's a charming product.

00:07:46,992 --> 00:07:48,195
I love the personalization
  of it.

00:07:48,195 --> 00:07:51,001
But it's too big.
  I'm out.

00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:54,942
Thank you, Barbara.
  I understand.

00:07:58,316 --> 00:08:00,053
Let me throw an offer at you,
  because I'm -- I'm interested.

00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:05,665
There's a fair amount of work
  that has to happen here

00:08:05,665 --> 00:08:07,035
to pull it into retail,

00:08:07,035 --> 00:08:08,605
where 90% of the boxes
  are bought,

00:08:08,605 --> 00:08:10,709
where I bought mine
  my whole life with my kids.

00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:12,813
And I think I can help there
  in a lot of ways.

00:08:12,813 --> 00:08:18,091
I'll give you the $150,000
  for 10% equity in your company.

00:08:18,091 --> 00:08:21,499
Plus, I want the same royalty
  deal that your designer has --

00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:27,245
5% sliding down to 1%
  based on sales volumes.

00:08:27,245 --> 00:08:29,316
Paul: Unfortunately,
  that type of a royalty

00:08:29,316 --> 00:08:30,886
is probably unsustainable.

00:08:33,592 --> 00:08:36,130
I'll give you the $150,000
  for 30%.

00:08:39,203 --> 00:08:42,176
You realize he just cut
  your valuation in half?

00:08:42,176 --> 00:08:43,446
I think we're gonna make it.

00:08:43,446 --> 00:08:46,251
I think this is
  a real home run.

00:08:46,251 --> 00:08:49,726
This is a time to make
  a decision. What do you say?

00:08:49,726 --> 00:08:51,563
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
  whoa, whoa, whoa.
  Well, let me put a little
  pressure on Robert for you.

00:08:51,563 --> 00:08:53,100
I can -- I might be able
  to squeeze him out.
  May I just ask you
  one question?

00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,235
Herjavec: What do you say?
  What do you say?

00:08:54,235 --> 00:08:56,507
Well, I'll make it
  even more interesting.

00:09:03,287 --> 00:09:05,426
Narrator:
  Two sharks are out.

00:09:05,426 --> 00:09:08,032
Paul and Cyndi
  have two offers --

00:09:08,032 --> 00:09:11,405
One from Kevin,
  who is offering $150,000

00:09:11,405 --> 00:09:13,810
for a 10% stake

00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:17,451
plus a sliding 5% to 1% royalty

00:09:17,451 --> 00:09:19,155
based on sales.

00:09:19,155 --> 00:09:22,127
Robert is offering $150,000

00:09:22,127 --> 00:09:24,232
for a 30% stake.

00:09:24,232 --> 00:09:26,403
But Lori may also want to bite.

00:09:26,403 --> 00:09:29,677
Well, I'll make it
  even more interesting.
  [ laughter ]

00:09:29,677 --> 00:09:31,013
great.
  We'd love to hear it.

00:09:31,013 --> 00:09:33,920
I'm gonna offer you
  the 150k...

00:09:36,592 --> 00:09:38,930
...for 20%.

00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,035
And I'm already in Disney.

00:09:41,035 --> 00:09:43,807
I also have a relationship
  with walmart.

00:09:43,807 --> 00:09:45,745
Herjavec: I think we can all
  get you into Disney.

00:09:45,745 --> 00:09:47,749
I believe
  in the product.

00:09:47,749 --> 00:09:50,989
Robert's at 30% equity.
  Lori's at 20%.

00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:52,493
You basically told me

00:09:52,493 --> 00:09:54,930
you're not gonna look at my
  offer with a royalty, correct?

00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,100
Right.
  That's fair.

00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,371
All right, so,
  I'll give you the $150,000.

00:09:58,371 --> 00:10:01,445
I'm gonna set a ratchet --
  I'm gonna go at 20%,

00:10:01,445 --> 00:10:04,251
but you can buy me
  all the way back down to 12.5%

00:10:04,251 --> 00:10:07,892
if you pay me back my $150,000
  in 18 months.

00:10:07,892 --> 00:10:08,994
What if they don't?

00:10:11,633 --> 00:10:13,003
I stay at 20%.

00:10:13,003 --> 00:10:15,708
It's like
  a roulette wheel.

00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:18,247
I would give you
  a similar deal.
  Cyndi: Okay.

00:10:18,247 --> 00:10:22,556
$150,000 for 15%.

00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:25,930
But you have to pay me back
  the 150k

00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:29,304
within the first 15 months.

00:10:29,304 --> 00:10:31,776
I just saved you
  $265,000.

00:10:31,776 --> 00:10:33,346
[ laughs ]
  That's what happened
  there.

00:10:33,346 --> 00:10:34,648
Thank you, Mr. Wonderful.

00:10:34,648 --> 00:10:35,684
I don't need
  the money back.

00:10:35,684 --> 00:10:39,391
I'll give you the $150,000
  for 15% --

00:10:39,391 --> 00:10:41,296
Exactly
  what you asked for.

00:10:41,296 --> 00:10:43,601
What I can do for you
  is take you to retail

00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,037
and help you
  go through Disney.

00:10:45,037 --> 00:10:47,342
You don't have to pay me back
  in 15 months.

00:10:47,342 --> 00:10:50,415
I'm not
  a loan tank kind of guy.
  [ both laugh ]

00:10:50,415 --> 00:10:53,488
I think there's
  lots of talk.
  O'Leary:
  Wait, wait, wait.

00:10:53,488 --> 00:10:54,658
Let me put some more pressure
  on everybody.
  Paul, I gave you exactly --

00:10:54,658 --> 00:10:56,194
Let me put
  some more pressure on,

00:10:56,194 --> 00:10:58,399
'cause I saved you
  a ton of money.
  I'm gonna say
  one last thing.

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,907
People can throw money
  at you all day long.
  Paul, I gave you exactly
  what you're looking for today.

00:11:01,907 --> 00:11:04,044
Paul: Yes.
  But if they don't know
  what to do with it,

00:11:04,044 --> 00:11:06,816
then it's really
  not very valuable.

00:11:06,816 --> 00:11:09,289
Well, Robert,
  can I ask you?

00:11:09,289 --> 00:11:11,761
Lori gave some examples
  of already being in Disney

00:11:11,761 --> 00:11:13,898
and having a relationship
  with walmart.
  Cuban: Let me -- on --
  on Disney -- Let me --

00:11:13,898 --> 00:11:17,139
Yeah, but you're not even
  on this.
  Not to jump on Robert.
  I'm just gonna educate them.

00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:19,176
People from Disney come in,
  and they say,

00:11:19,176 --> 00:11:21,782
"All the products that you guys
  invested in 'Shark Tank' --

00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:24,487
We'd love to find
  a way to get them in Disney."
  To all of us.

00:11:24,487 --> 00:11:26,993
And they've just got to
  go through a process.
  But why is there only one
  that's in Disney now

00:11:26,993 --> 00:11:28,296
and "Shark Tank's" Been on
  for so many years?
  Because different --

00:11:28,296 --> 00:11:29,899
Because different products
  have different types --

00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:32,237
Because different products
  have different test terms.
  No, it's because

00:11:32,237 --> 00:11:34,075
you have to know
  how to operate.
  We've got products there.

00:11:34,075 --> 00:11:36,112
No, no, come on.
  And I knew
  how to make it happen,

00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,517
because I've been in retail
  for 17 years.

00:11:38,517 --> 00:11:40,221
I am the one here
  out of your choices --

00:11:40,221 --> 00:11:43,495
You know, before we go on
  with half an hour of this...

00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:44,797
I'm just gonna put a little more
  pressure on it all,

00:11:44,797 --> 00:11:47,436
just 'cause I'm having fun.

00:11:47,436 --> 00:11:50,142
I'm gonna reduce my equity --
  In other words,

00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:53,583
if you do pay me back in
  the 18 months that I suggested,

00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,353
I'll drop it down to 10%.

00:11:55,353 --> 00:11:57,090
So I'm gonna be 20%
  down to 10%.

00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,729
I'm the lowest
  of them all now.

00:11:59,729 --> 00:12:02,368
I would like you
  to tell me

00:12:02,368 --> 00:12:05,274
whether or not you're going to
  take my offer now.

00:12:08,815 --> 00:12:10,018
Hmm.

00:12:10,018 --> 00:12:12,624
You won't allow us
  to step out in the hallway

00:12:12,624 --> 00:12:14,093
for just a moment?
  Just step out
  for just a minute?

00:12:14,093 --> 00:12:17,100
The problem is sometimes
  when you walk out,

00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,469
things change in here,
  right?
  O'Leary: Right.

00:12:18,469 --> 00:12:20,173
Mm-hmm. True.

00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:21,609
You never know.
  They're choppy waters.

00:12:23,112 --> 00:12:26,152
Would any of you
  be willing to team up?

00:12:29,225 --> 00:12:31,297
Yeah, I'll go in
  with Kevin's deal.

00:12:34,436 --> 00:12:38,979
I think there is a value
  in having more sharks.

00:12:38,979 --> 00:12:42,353
$150,000 for --
  okay.

00:12:42,353 --> 00:12:46,294
It's 20%, but if they
  pay it back in 18 months,

00:12:46,294 --> 00:12:48,833
it drops to 10%.
  Greiner: drops to 10%.

00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:52,709
Those are your options.
  What are you going to do?

00:12:56,917 --> 00:12:59,356
Robert,
  Mr. Wonderful...

00:12:59,356 --> 00:13:00,792
I think we've got a deal.
  ...I think we have a deal!

00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:01,895
O'Leary: All right.
  Whoo!

00:13:01,895 --> 00:13:03,632
All right!

00:13:03,632 --> 00:13:05,536
CUBAN: Congrats, guys.
  Herjavec: That was awesome.

00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:07,273
This actually is
  the best financial deal for you.
  It's a great product.

00:13:07,273 --> 00:13:09,177
Thank you all so much.

00:13:09,177 --> 00:13:10,947
Greiner: Good luck.
  Thank you.

00:13:10,947 --> 00:13:12,985
Yay!

00:13:12,985 --> 00:13:15,223
Yay! Good job!

00:13:15,223 --> 00:13:17,160
I'm so excited!
  Oh!

00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,730
PAUL:
  We really wanted Robert.

00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,901
We were so excited
  when he loved the design.

00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:21,971
It was fantastic.

00:13:21,971 --> 00:13:24,209
And to get Mr. Wonderful
  in there, as well,

00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:26,847
helping us grow the business,
  could not have asked for more.

00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,618
I think we just stick with
  this design.
  Yeah.

00:13:28,618 --> 00:13:31,524
I think every kid
  should see this in the morning.

00:13:31,524 --> 00:13:33,261
They're gonna have nightmares
  every night about it.

00:13:38,272 --> 00:13:39,407
Narrator: Last season,

00:13:39,407 --> 00:13:41,512
Marc newburger and Jeffrey Simon
  made a deal

00:13:41,512 --> 00:13:44,418
with Lori Greiner for their
  car-Safety product, drop stop.

00:13:44,418 --> 00:13:46,957
Drop Stop
  reduces driver distraction

00:13:46,957 --> 00:13:49,763
by keeping your eyes
  on the road, not in your gap.

00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:51,800
The built-In slot
  is designed

00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,839
to fit easily around
  the seat-Belt catch like so.

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,511
You won't even know it's there
  till it stops the drop.

00:13:56,511 --> 00:13:58,649
We can make a lot of money
  together,

00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:00,419
but we can also save
  a lot of lives together.

00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:03,058
Let's see how Marc and Jeffrey
  are doing now.

00:14:05,664 --> 00:14:07,401
Since appearing
  on "Shark Tank,"

00:14:07,401 --> 00:14:09,271
we have sold hundreds
  of thousands of drop stops.

00:14:09,271 --> 00:14:11,008
And that's not just sales
  for us.

00:14:11,008 --> 00:14:14,249
That is
  lots of jobs created.

00:14:14,249 --> 00:14:16,153
Simon: In the short five months
  since we aired,

00:14:16,153 --> 00:14:19,326
we have grossed
  over $5 million in sales.

00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:21,029
In the next 12 months,

00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:24,103
we project
  over $15 million in sales.

00:14:24,103 --> 00:14:28,111
And Lori just landed us
  our first National retail deal.

00:14:29,815 --> 00:14:31,285
Greiner: [ gasps ]

00:14:31,285 --> 00:14:34,224
Oh, my.
  Oh, my gosh!
  Oh, my god!

00:14:34,224 --> 00:14:35,360
[ laughing ]
  Oh, my god!

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,898
Not only
  did we get into walmart,

00:14:37,898 --> 00:14:40,404
but we got
  into 3,500 walmarts.

00:14:40,404 --> 00:14:44,980
That was an order
  valued at $2 million.

00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,751
What a dream come True.
  My God.

00:14:46,751 --> 00:14:48,788
This is unbelievable.
  Dream come True.
  Amazing.

00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:50,993
We're going to take over
  the world,

00:14:50,993 --> 00:14:54,234
and we're not gonna stop
  until every seat gap is filled.

00:14:54,234 --> 00:14:56,238
We are going to make
  a ton of money together,

00:14:56,238 --> 00:14:57,975
but we're also gonna help
  save lives.

00:14:57,975 --> 00:14:59,712
She's the best partner
  we could have,

00:14:59,712 --> 00:15:01,282
and we have
  just gotten started.

00:15:01,282 --> 00:15:03,386
Whoo!
  Whoo!
  Whoo!

00:15:03,386 --> 00:15:06,526
A few months ago,
  after appearing on "Shark Tank,"

00:15:06,526 --> 00:15:09,064
We were honored to
  get an e-Mail from an
  OFFICER, David Gerlach,

00:15:09,064 --> 00:15:10,735
and said drop Stop
  could really help

00:15:10,735 --> 00:15:13,107
to reduce driver distraction
  for officers.

00:15:13,107 --> 00:15:15,244
So that's why we came
  out here -- We wanted to
  donate a set of drop stops

00:15:15,244 --> 00:15:18,885
to all 425 officers
  of this police department.

00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:21,659
Literally, to be able
  to give something back

00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:24,465
to the people who,
  every single day, risk
  their lives for us,

00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,235
it's just truly
  a dream come True.

00:15:26,235 --> 00:15:27,838
All:
  Don't drop and drive!

00:15:36,189 --> 00:15:39,630
I'm Kelley coughlan.
  And I'm jenn Deese.

00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,099
And we are best friends

00:15:41,099 --> 00:15:43,271
living in Sunny Santa Monica,
  california.

00:15:43,271 --> 00:15:45,108
We're typical l.A. Girls.

00:15:45,108 --> 00:15:48,047
We love going Out and can't live
  without our phones.

00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:49,618
Melrose P.R.
  This is Jen.

00:15:49,618 --> 00:15:51,655
We launched our own company,
  melrose P.R.

00:15:51,655 --> 00:15:55,196
We represent clients in travel,
  hospitality, entertainment.

00:15:55,196 --> 00:15:56,833
Working in P.R. In l.A.,

00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,537
we're at the forefront
  of the industry.

00:15:58,537 --> 00:16:00,207
There's lights,
  there's cameras,

00:16:00,207 --> 00:16:02,913
there's red carpet,
  and it's always showtime.

00:16:02,913 --> 00:16:05,318
Our product keeps all your
  essentials at your fingertips,

00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:08,391
so gone are the days of digging
  through your oversized handbag.

00:16:08,391 --> 00:16:11,263
We help lighten your load
  and keep you stylin',

00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,466
all at the same time.

00:16:12,466 --> 00:16:14,637
We know we can get exposure

00:16:14,637 --> 00:16:15,639
with our P.R. Backgrounds,

00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:16,842
but we need help
  with sales.

00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:19,113
We don't know how to get
  into big-Box retailers.

00:16:19,113 --> 00:16:22,387
We want every woman to be able
  to have our product,

00:16:22,387 --> 00:16:24,491
but we need the help of
  the sharks to make that happen.

00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,837
Hi, sharks.
  I'm Kelley coughlan.

00:16:45,837 --> 00:16:47,073
And I'm jenn Deese.

00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:48,542
And we are
  the creators of...

00:16:48,542 --> 00:16:49,679
pursecase.
  Pursecase.

00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,120
We are here seeking
  a $55,000 investment

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,557
in exchange for 12%
  in our company.

00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:57,763
If you were to ask people
  what's the one thing

00:16:57,763 --> 00:16:59,933
that they would never
  leave the house without,

00:16:59,933 --> 00:17:02,539
we are confident that
  a smartphone would top the list.

00:17:02,539 --> 00:17:06,180
We love our clutches
  and our totes, but in reality,

00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,419
they're just not
  the most convenient accessory

00:17:08,419 --> 00:17:10,222
for busy publicists
  like ourselves.

00:17:10,222 --> 00:17:11,759
[ cellphone RINGS ]
  [ laughter ]

00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:14,899
How many times
  have you heard that noise

00:17:14,899 --> 00:17:18,073
and had to dig through
  your oversized handbag
  to find your phone?

00:17:18,073 --> 00:17:20,110
And who wants to shove
  their smartphone

00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:22,081
in the back pocket
  of their skinny jeans?

00:17:22,081 --> 00:17:23,451
Not cute.

00:17:23,451 --> 00:17:26,056
So, this leaves you
  with one option, and that is

00:17:26,056 --> 00:17:27,425
carrying your phone around
  with you in your hand,

00:17:27,425 --> 00:17:29,396
which you might
  accidentally drop

00:17:29,396 --> 00:17:31,935
or you're gonna eventually
  Put down somewhere

00:17:31,935 --> 00:17:34,140
and forget about it
  and lose it.

00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,579
We kept asking ourselves,
  why isn't there

00:17:36,579 --> 00:17:38,148
something that keeps
  everything we need

00:17:38,148 --> 00:17:40,987
easy to access
  and secure?
  There has to be a better way.

00:17:40,987 --> 00:17:43,626
There has to be.
  Well, now there is.

00:17:43,626 --> 00:17:46,900
Introducing pursecase...
  ta-Da!

00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,172
...The first ever
  smartphone clutch
  that's elegantly designed

00:17:49,172 --> 00:17:51,978
with just your phone
  and your essentials in mind.

00:17:51,978 --> 00:17:55,418
Now you can keep
  your cash, cards, and I.D.

00:17:55,418 --> 00:17:58,057
All at your fingertips
  in the most stylish way.

00:17:58,057 --> 00:18:00,362
Pursecase comes
  in a variety of colors

00:18:00,362 --> 00:18:02,333
to help accessorize
  any outfit,

00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,271
always
  with a stylish chain handle,

00:18:04,271 --> 00:18:06,208
which doubles
  as a bracelet,

00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,279
and a compact mirror

00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:10,584
just in case
  of a fashion emergency.

00:18:10,584 --> 00:18:12,888
Deese: So, now I'm gonna
  pass them out for you guys.

00:18:12,888 --> 00:18:15,260
Here's the classy white
  for you.

00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,231
'cause I'm a classy guy.
  Of course!

00:18:17,231 --> 00:18:18,734
Your daughters
  can fight over that.

00:18:18,734 --> 00:18:20,305
The royal purple
  for you, Lori,

00:18:20,305 --> 00:18:22,008
queen of qvc.
  Thank you. [ laughs ]

00:18:22,008 --> 00:18:24,446
the black for you,
  Mr. Wonderful.
  I love it. Thank you.

00:18:24,446 --> 00:18:25,816
Herjavec: Oh!
  I accept the bribe.
  Greiner: Oh, I got money.
  [ laughs ]

00:18:25,816 --> 00:18:27,787
I got money, too!

00:18:27,787 --> 00:18:30,359
DEESE: And then blue
  for the mavs for you, mark.
  Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,263
Coughlan: Sharks, we know
  we have a hit on our hands,

00:18:32,263 --> 00:18:34,301
and we are
  at the tipping point.

00:18:34,301 --> 00:18:36,205
We are hustlers,
  and we are ready

00:18:36,205 --> 00:18:39,511
to start making your money back
  immediately.

00:18:39,511 --> 00:18:41,850
Deese: So, which lucky one
  of you wants to ride this wave

00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,721
to millions of dollars
  with us?

00:18:43,721 --> 00:18:46,293
Join the pursecase team,
  and you, too,

00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:48,865
can be stylin'...
  and Dialin'.

00:18:50,134 --> 00:18:53,876
Kelley, I just -- I just
  came back from europe.

00:18:53,876 --> 00:18:56,114
We were in Italy,
  and you see cases

00:18:56,114 --> 00:19:00,023
that look exactly like this
  for phones, covers.

00:19:00,023 --> 00:19:01,927
You do,
  but not with a pocket.

00:19:01,927 --> 00:19:03,262
That's the only difference.
  Yeah.

00:19:03,262 --> 00:19:05,066
So everything
  you're showing me here,

00:19:05,066 --> 00:19:07,238
including
  the little handle,

00:19:07,238 --> 00:19:09,676
is all over Europe
  in those little, cheap stores,

00:19:09,676 --> 00:19:10,745
except the pocket.

00:19:10,745 --> 00:19:11,948
That's right.
  Correct.

00:19:11,948 --> 00:19:13,618
Greiner:
  I have a question.

00:19:13,618 --> 00:19:15,722
You guys know
  phones are constantly changing.
  Absolutely.

00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:19,831
So what smartphones
  do you have pursecases for?

00:19:19,831 --> 00:19:21,535
Currently,
  we're making pursecase

00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,472
for iphone 4
  and iphone 5.

00:19:23,472 --> 00:19:26,980
However, we have filed for
  a utility patent,

00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:31,055
which covers the functionality
  of having the flap

00:19:31,055 --> 00:19:32,826
for a credit-Card, I.D.,
  a little bit of cash,

00:19:32,826 --> 00:19:35,498
and, also,
  with a chain handle.

00:19:35,498 --> 00:19:37,234
How much do you think
  you'll sell of this stuff?

00:19:37,234 --> 00:19:38,971
We're just now starting
  to fulfill orders.

00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:40,308
But in the first
  three months,

00:19:40,308 --> 00:19:41,845
we did $30,000
  simply of preorders.

00:19:41,845 --> 00:19:44,484
Wow.

00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:45,753
And then we've projected

00:19:45,753 --> 00:19:49,895
for this first calendar year
  of ours, in business,

00:19:49,895 --> 00:19:51,799
about $240,000.

00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:55,607
What does it cost you
  to make it?
  $4.42.

00:19:55,607 --> 00:19:57,945
And then it's $15 wholesale,
  $38 retail.

00:19:57,945 --> 00:19:59,616
Our margins
  are really good --

00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,987
88% when we sell
  direct Online

00:20:01,987 --> 00:20:04,059
and then 71%.

00:20:04,059 --> 00:20:06,496
O'Leary: You don't find it
  a little steep at $38

00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:10,105
for the online orders?
  We've had no resistance
  to the price whatsoever.

00:20:10,105 --> 00:20:11,841
Ladies, you should be
  selling it for $19.95

00:20:11,841 --> 00:20:13,879
and you'd sell
  10 times more.

00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,026
We did some P.R.
  Around the initial prototypes,

00:20:20,026 --> 00:20:22,097
and the demand
  was just insane.

00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:24,201
And a manufacturer
  actually came to us.

00:20:24,201 --> 00:20:25,404
Who is that?
  Did they do a deal
  with you?

00:20:25,404 --> 00:20:26,639
It's called
  dall international,

00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:28,176
and it's
  a logistics company.

00:20:28,176 --> 00:20:29,445
And they said, "Listen,

00:20:29,445 --> 00:20:31,484
"We want to make a deal
  with you guys.

00:20:31,484 --> 00:20:35,058
We see this as being
  a huge opportunity
  for our company."

00:20:35,058 --> 00:20:36,393
What's your deal with them,
  though?

00:20:36,393 --> 00:20:38,599
15% equity stake
  in the company.

00:20:40,569 --> 00:20:44,377
But they have extended us
  a million-Dollar credit line.

00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:45,680
Wow.
  Cuban: Good for you guys.

00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,818
We can do any-- I mean, we can
  get things here in 45 days.

00:20:47,818 --> 00:20:50,022
So, why do you need
  the $55,000?

00:20:50,022 --> 00:20:52,695
We're looking to cast
  a wider net.

00:20:52,695 --> 00:20:54,766
We're gonna spend
  some of the money on molds

00:20:54,766 --> 00:20:56,436
to move into
  the Samsung galaxy s4.

00:20:56,436 --> 00:20:59,743
That's the initial
  one that we have a
  lot of demand for.

00:20:59,743 --> 00:21:01,547
Do you know
  I sell something

00:21:01,547 --> 00:21:04,186
that looks really similar
  to that already...

00:21:04,186 --> 00:21:06,591
didn't know that.

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,665
Ooh.
  ...on Qvc?

00:21:09,665 --> 00:21:11,067
What does it
  look like?

00:21:11,067 --> 00:21:12,537
It looks
  very much like that.

00:21:16,145 --> 00:21:20,221
Jenn, Kelley, I-I admire
  all the work that you've done,

00:21:20,221 --> 00:21:22,458
but seriously...

00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,697
I just spent two weeks looking
  at this on every street corner.

00:21:24,697 --> 00:21:26,032
I'm out.

00:21:27,502 --> 00:21:30,943
Well, we appreciate that.
  Coughlan: Thank you.
  We appreciate that.

00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:33,949
Corcoran:
  I think, jenn and Kelley --

00:21:33,949 --> 00:21:35,453
I think the design on this
  is adorable.

00:21:35,453 --> 00:21:36,688
Thank you. Thank you.
  It's very Chanel-Y.

00:21:36,688 --> 00:21:39,394
And I'm sure that's
  exactly what you're after.

00:21:39,394 --> 00:21:40,697
I think the Mirror's clever.

00:21:40,697 --> 00:21:42,401
But the two pieces
  I would have liked to have seen

00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,272
is a change purse
  and basically no flap.

00:21:44,272 --> 00:21:47,645
I kind of like it
  streamlined.

00:21:47,645 --> 00:21:49,415
Not for me. I'm out.

00:21:49,415 --> 00:21:50,885
Okay.

00:21:50,885 --> 00:21:53,023
We appreciate that.
  Thank you.
  All right. Thank you.

00:21:53,023 --> 00:21:54,626
Guys, I'll go next.
  Um...

00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:59,671
I'm not a fan of the
  technology-Accessory business.

00:21:59,671 --> 00:22:03,111
That's just not me, because
  it's just e-Everybody's whim,

00:22:03,111 --> 00:22:05,349
and if you make a zig
  and Everybody else zags,

00:22:05,349 --> 00:22:06,485
you're out of luck.

00:22:06,485 --> 00:22:07,521
I'm out.

00:22:07,521 --> 00:22:09,291
Okay. Thank you.
  Thank you.

00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:11,662
I appreciate that.

00:22:11,662 --> 00:22:13,232
O'Leary:
  I like you guys, and I think

00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:15,237
what you brought to the table
  is rather unique,

00:22:15,237 --> 00:22:17,475
particularly
  a million-Dollar credit line.

00:22:17,475 --> 00:22:18,444
That's pretty rare.

00:22:18,444 --> 00:22:20,281
So here's an offer for you.

00:22:20,281 --> 00:22:22,586
I give you $55,000.

00:22:22,586 --> 00:22:24,590
I get $1 a unit

00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:28,632
until I get my $55,000 back,

00:22:28,632 --> 00:22:31,805
and then I get 75 cents a unit
  in perpetuity.

00:22:31,805 --> 00:22:33,476
Herjavec: Wow.

00:22:33,476 --> 00:22:35,346
Appreciate your offer.
  Thank you for your offer.

00:22:35,346 --> 00:22:36,649
Wasn't expecting that.

00:22:39,655 --> 00:22:41,961
You know, I always say
  I can tell instantly

00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:44,265
if it's a hero or a zero.

00:22:45,535 --> 00:22:49,109
And the minute
  that you walked in here,

00:22:49,109 --> 00:22:50,913
I looked at it,
  and I thought...

00:22:53,652 --> 00:22:56,258
...it's a superhero.

00:22:56,258 --> 00:22:59,330
I really like it.

00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:04,275
Now, it is very much like
  something that I already sell.

00:23:04,275 --> 00:23:06,880
But because I've sold

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,285
hundreds of thousands
  of my own...
  we know.

00:23:09,285 --> 00:23:11,055
...I think that I can sell

00:23:11,055 --> 00:23:12,725
hundreds of thousands
  of these, too.

00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,897
So I'm gonna make you
  an offer.

00:23:16,366 --> 00:23:19,574
And my offer is...

00:23:19,574 --> 00:23:21,711
$55,000, 15%.

00:23:21,711 --> 00:23:24,116
That's it.

00:23:27,691 --> 00:23:30,597
That's a deal.
  Lori, you've got a deal.

00:23:30,597 --> 00:23:32,067
Like, no questions asked.

00:23:32,067 --> 00:23:34,171
You've basically gave us
  exactly what we wanted.
  Oh, my.

00:23:34,171 --> 00:23:36,376
And thank you.
  But Kelley, jenn,
  what about Kevin's offer?

00:23:36,376 --> 00:23:39,082
Mr. Wonderful, we so
  appreciate the offer, but...
  we really do
  appreciate that.

00:23:39,082 --> 00:23:40,652
We came in here for Lori.
  You know we did.

00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:42,154
I love it. I love it.
  Thank you!

00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,224
I think it's awesome.

00:23:43,224 --> 00:23:45,830
We're so excited!
  Aah!

00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,667
[ laughs ]
  That's exactly
  what we wanted,

00:23:47,667 --> 00:23:49,437
and I cannot wait
  to work with you.
  Thank you! Aah!

00:23:49,437 --> 00:23:50,640
It's really, really cute.

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,608
Thank you, everyone!
  Thank you guys so much!

00:23:51,608 --> 00:23:52,377
Nice job.

00:23:52,377 --> 00:23:54,414
[ laughing ] Oh, my God.

00:23:54,414 --> 00:23:55,483
I might cry.

00:23:55,483 --> 00:23:57,788
Yes!
  We're gonna sell a million!

00:23:57,788 --> 00:23:59,325
Does it not worry you
  that there's

00:23:59,325 --> 00:24:00,794
so many things like it
  out there?

00:24:00,794 --> 00:24:03,099
Cuban: For $55,000?
  No, because I have
  the perfect medium.

00:24:03,099 --> 00:24:05,170
I have a show on qvc.
  Yeah. This is perfect
  for qvc.

00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:06,907
It's just a line extension
  to you.

00:24:06,907 --> 00:24:08,110
My customers
  will love this,

00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,446
and I want to bring it
  to them at a great price.

00:24:09,446 --> 00:24:10,983
Good job, Lori.
  That'll be great for you.
  Herjavec: Wow.

00:24:21,272 --> 00:24:23,309
Narrator:
  Next up is an entrepreneur

00:24:23,309 --> 00:24:26,015
with a sweet take
  on customization.

00:24:35,569 --> 00:24:36,938
[ Boston Accent ]
  Hello, sharks.

00:24:36,938 --> 00:24:40,078
My name is Joe dauenhauer,
  and my company is chocomize.

00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:41,414
I'm seeking $500,000

00:24:41,414 --> 00:24:44,086
in exchange for a 20% equity
  interest in my company.

00:24:44,086 --> 00:24:47,027
The current chocolate-Bar market
  hasn't seen much innovation

00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,696
in its products
  in a very long time.

00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:51,836
Quite frankly, most chocolate
  bars are just plain Boring.

00:24:51,836 --> 00:24:54,142
Chocomize solves this problem
  by allowing customers

00:24:54,142 --> 00:24:56,613
to create their own
  chocolate bars online.

00:24:56,613 --> 00:24:58,685
Let me show you how it works.

00:24:58,685 --> 00:25:00,622
Customers start
  by choosing a shape.

00:25:00,622 --> 00:25:03,094
Then, they choose
  a belgian-Based chocolate

00:25:03,094 --> 00:25:05,298
of milk, dark, or white,

00:25:05,298 --> 00:25:07,235
and the choice to add
  up to five toppings

00:25:07,235 --> 00:25:09,274
from a selection of over 100.

00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:11,778
In addition to creating the
  chocolate bar of your dreams,

00:25:11,778 --> 00:25:13,549
our bars are perfect
  for all occasions.

00:25:13,549 --> 00:25:15,587
We put special edible messages
  in the chocolate bars,

00:25:15,587 --> 00:25:16,956
such as "Happy birthday."

00:25:16,956 --> 00:25:19,428
We also can put
  special edible corporate logos

00:25:19,428 --> 00:25:21,600
or pictures
  in the chocolate bar,

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,804
making it great for
  corporate events and weddings.

00:25:23,804 --> 00:25:26,744
So I've packed up some dreamy,
  delicious chocolate bars

00:25:26,744 --> 00:25:28,347
that have been made special
  for each one of you.

00:25:28,347 --> 00:25:30,719
Greiner:
  You're from massachusetts?

00:25:30,719 --> 00:25:32,155
Easy to tell, right?

00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:34,794
I love your accent.
  I love that accent.

00:25:34,794 --> 00:25:35,864
Thank you.
  Herjavec: Thank you.

00:25:35,864 --> 00:25:37,868
Greiner: Thank you.
  Low-Cal, right?

00:25:37,868 --> 00:25:39,938
[ laughs ] Completely.
  [ Laughs ] low-Cal.

00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:41,509
Oh, it's cute.

00:25:41,509 --> 00:25:44,481
Wow. This tastes great.
  Corcoran: Mmm.

00:25:44,481 --> 00:25:46,352
Joe, what's the middle
  made from, the picture part?

00:25:46,352 --> 00:25:49,057
Can you eat that, too?
  Everything's edible.

00:25:49,057 --> 00:25:50,962
What are you doing
  in the chocolate business?

00:25:50,962 --> 00:25:52,933
My partner, Fabian,
  who's from Germany --

00:25:52,933 --> 00:25:54,537
He started the company
  three years ago.

00:25:54,537 --> 00:25:58,211
And about a year and a half ago,
  I decided to join him.

00:25:58,211 --> 00:26:00,917
My background
  is actually finance.

00:26:00,917 --> 00:26:03,489
Greiner:
  So, are you partners?
  We're partners together.
  Exactly.

00:26:03,489 --> 00:26:05,660
What's the split?
  He actually
  owns half the company,

00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:08,632
and myself and one
  other shareholder own about 18%,

00:26:08,632 --> 00:26:10,737
and then we have
  two other shareholders.

00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:11,973
So, Joe,
  walk me through the numbers.

00:26:11,973 --> 00:26:16,182
So, last year,
  we -- We did $440,000 in sales.

00:26:16,182 --> 00:26:18,421
Okay. But -- but what about
  the year before? Just curious.

00:26:18,421 --> 00:26:20,792
The year before,
  we actually did $500,000.

00:26:23,397 --> 00:26:26,571
Oh, so you had a dip
  last year?
  A small dip.

00:26:26,571 --> 00:26:28,675
Part of the reason
  is because we moved facilities.

00:26:28,675 --> 00:26:31,147
We built out
  a 5,000-Square-Foot facility

00:26:31,147 --> 00:26:32,483
where we make
  all the chocolate, so --

00:26:32,483 --> 00:26:36,057
is this a really tiny niche
  that's gonna stay tiny?

00:26:36,057 --> 00:26:38,096
Because I guess
  if I analyze your customers,

00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,433
am I gonna find a bunch
  of people buying it once,

00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:42,872
having fun, giving it as
  a gift, and that's about it,

00:26:42,872 --> 00:26:45,711
or do I have repeat orders
  from the same customers?
  No, there's repeat orders.

00:26:45,711 --> 00:26:48,517
We are by far the largest
  customized chocolate in
  the United States.

00:26:48,517 --> 00:26:50,656
You got $500,000
  in sales!
  Yeah.

00:26:50,656 --> 00:26:52,860
There's no company that's
  dominant with $500,000 in sales.

00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,730
But -- but -- but -- but --
  but -- but this year,

00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:56,501
we have
  a very large car company

00:26:56,501 --> 00:26:58,406
in the U.S. That we do
  a promotional event.

00:26:58,406 --> 00:27:00,610
In the last 12 months, we've
  done over $125,000 in Sales.

00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,047
Yeah, that's gonna be
  your business --

00:27:02,047 --> 00:27:04,051
Corporate-Type purchases,
  as opposed to consumer.

00:27:04,051 --> 00:27:05,420
Exactly, and that's what
  we're trying to focus on.

00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:08,527
Joe, walk me through the
  profit margin on a single bar.

00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:11,199
We sell our bars for
  an average of $6 to $6.50,

00:27:11,199 --> 00:27:13,571
depending on what toppings
  and customization.

00:27:13,571 --> 00:27:15,375
And what does it cost you
  to make?

00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:16,711
It costs us
  about $2 to make.

00:27:16,711 --> 00:27:18,882
Okay, but what's your plan
  for your investors?

00:27:18,882 --> 00:27:20,753
Let's say I actually
  agreed with this valuation,

00:27:20,753 --> 00:27:23,325
which I haven't even
  started to tear the
  peanuts out of yet.

00:27:23,325 --> 00:27:26,331
Okay.
  Let's just think
  about the $500,000

00:27:26,331 --> 00:27:29,137
I give you as a minority guy
  with 20%.

00:27:29,137 --> 00:27:31,576
How do I get
  my chocolate back?

00:27:31,576 --> 00:27:32,678
You're gonna
  get your money back

00:27:32,678 --> 00:27:34,816
in approximately
  three to four years,

00:27:34,816 --> 00:27:36,587
or in the case
  of a liquidation event,

00:27:36,587 --> 00:27:38,791
in which we're a great
  acquisition target, our company.

00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:40,661
Why would you -- Why
  would you be a great
  acquisition target?

00:27:40,661 --> 00:27:43,635
'Cause I don't see it.
  Be-Because -- Because the LARGE
  companies mass-Produce.

00:27:43,635 --> 00:27:46,608
What we do is -- Is --
  is customize.
  Do you know why they
  mass-Produce?

00:27:46,608 --> 00:27:48,145
Because they make money
  that way.

00:27:50,984 --> 00:27:53,088
Cuban: Where --
  It's a much different model

00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,025
than a mass-Production model,
  which are not -- not alike.
  I get that, right?

00:27:55,025 --> 00:27:56,262
But there's nothing there

00:27:56,262 --> 00:27:58,834
that can't be reproduced
  by somebody else.

00:28:00,571 --> 00:28:03,577
Could I take $2 million
  or $2.5 million

00:28:03,577 --> 00:28:05,781
and go and do
  the exact same thing?

00:28:05,781 --> 00:28:09,255
W-W-- I mean, you c--
  You technically could do it,

00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:11,059
but you'd be hiring people
  to manage it --

00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:13,631
people like me, who are
  quality -- Quality managers.

00:28:15,001 --> 00:28:17,774
All right. Today is
  the best day of your life.

00:28:17,774 --> 00:28:20,580
You've come
  into the Shark Tank.

00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,484
You've met me,
  Mr. Wonderful.

00:28:22,484 --> 00:28:24,989
I'll make you an offer.

00:28:26,726 --> 00:28:28,163
Leave these guys.

00:28:28,163 --> 00:28:30,033
[ laughs ]

00:28:30,033 --> 00:28:33,173
I'll give you $500,000
  to start from scratch.

00:28:33,173 --> 00:28:34,843
You're my chocolate guy.

00:28:34,843 --> 00:28:37,182
You're gonna get 25% equity
  in the business.

00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:41,625
That's a first.
  [ chuckles ]
  I wouldn't do that.

00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:43,328
Why not? You're gonna get
  a lot more equity.

00:28:43,328 --> 00:28:45,032
And listen,
  anybody can do it.

00:28:45,032 --> 00:28:47,370
Anybody can't do it.
  That's the problem.

00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:48,907
We have a brand name.
  We have customer loyalty.

00:28:48,907 --> 00:28:50,277
People are beginning
  to recognize who we are.

00:28:50,277 --> 00:28:51,879
I don't have a brand name.
  Nobody knows Mr. Wonderful.

00:28:51,879 --> 00:28:53,583
I think I'll take a shot
  at it now. You're starting
  to get me interested.

00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:55,220
Mr. Wonderful's chocolate --
  Customized chocolate?

00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,423
Absolutely.
  Yeah.

00:28:56,423 --> 00:28:57,625
I'm in.
  Dauenhauer:
  I dare you to find a guy

00:28:57,625 --> 00:28:59,563
that's as good as managing it
  as me and Fabian.

00:28:59,563 --> 00:29:00,999
I just found one.
  It's you.
  [ laughter ]

00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:03,170

  That's a first.

00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:05,409
You know, Joe,
  with all due respect to Kevin,

00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:06,778
he thinks
  he can run any business.

00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:08,081
Of course.
  O'Leary: And he can.

00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:09,851
Hey, you know what,
  there's no one better than Kevin

00:29:09,851 --> 00:29:13,024
at running a business
  into the ground.
  [ laughter ]

00:29:13,024 --> 00:29:14,361
herjavec: The -- the thing
  that really turned me off --

00:29:14,361 --> 00:29:16,565
what you've said to me is
  I am the --

00:29:16,565 --> 00:29:17,902
at half a million
  a year,

00:29:17,902 --> 00:29:21,309
I am the dominant guy
  in the United States for this.

00:29:21,309 --> 00:29:22,678
Well, the customized space
  is small, right?

00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:25,150
The customize-- It's --
  It's a small market right now.

00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,052
And that excites me?

00:29:28,123 --> 00:29:29,927
Such a competitive
  business. Ooh.

00:29:29,927 --> 00:29:31,999
But -- but we don't know
  how big it is

00:29:31,999 --> 00:29:34,103
because we're -- We're -- We're
  the first big -- Big player

00:29:34,103 --> 00:29:35,439
in the market
  in the United States.

00:29:35,439 --> 00:29:37,977
Look, I love the chocolate,
  but I'm not sharing

00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:39,949
your -- your vision on the size
  of the market.

00:29:39,949 --> 00:29:41,351
Look, this is the thing.

00:29:41,351 --> 00:29:42,721
It -- It's a tchotchke.

00:29:42,721 --> 00:29:45,894
Look, I'm getting over
  the sugar high.

00:29:45,894 --> 00:29:47,798
I'm starting to crash.
  I'm out.

00:29:47,798 --> 00:29:50,203
Thank you.

00:29:50,203 --> 00:29:52,442
Cuban: Look, if you came in
  and said that you had

00:29:52,442 --> 00:29:56,150
something very special in terms
  of your s.E.O.,

00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:59,089
in terms of your sales process,
  you invented something --

00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:00,726
but you haven't
  done that at all.

00:30:00,726 --> 00:30:02,930
You haven't
  differentiated yourself.

00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,467
And for that reason,
  I'm out.

00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,152
Corcoran: You said, uh,
  through your own admission

00:30:13,152 --> 00:30:15,658
that customization
  is expensive.

00:30:15,658 --> 00:30:17,628
And from my way
  of thinking,

00:30:17,628 --> 00:30:19,265
that's what's wrong
  with this business.

00:30:20,802 --> 00:30:23,173
And when I look
  at your packaging,

00:30:23,173 --> 00:30:24,977
I really think
  it looks dated,

00:30:24,977 --> 00:30:27,917
not attractive,

00:30:27,917 --> 00:30:30,288
and it wouldn't make me feel
  like I'm giving

00:30:30,288 --> 00:30:33,362
an EXPENSIVE or special anything
  to someone.

00:30:33,362 --> 00:30:35,233
That's part of what I want
  to use the money for, is to
  create new Packaging, as well.

00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:37,036
I don't think you're
  gonna generate a profit
  on this business

00:30:37,036 --> 00:30:39,307
for a very long time,
  so I'm out.

00:30:39,307 --> 00:30:42,114
Okay.

00:30:44,686 --> 00:30:48,093

  chocomize.

00:30:48,093 --> 00:30:49,496
Chocomize!

00:30:49,496 --> 00:30:51,667
I think that's clever.

00:30:51,667 --> 00:30:53,605
But this is
  a very niche market.

00:30:53,605 --> 00:30:55,275
For me, I like to go big,

00:30:55,275 --> 00:30:58,015

  in things that are
  gonna go really big.

00:30:58,015 --> 00:30:59,852
And I don't see that
  for this,

00:30:59,852 --> 00:31:02,056

  I'm out.

And, you know,
  we'll compete directly with him

00:31:56,773 --> 00:31:58,977
and hopefully crush him, and
  I can send him a bar that says,

00:31:58,977 --> 00:32:00,881
"Hey, you should have
  invested in Chocomize."

00:32:00,881 --> 00:32:02,451
He's got a nice, little
  business. You can't
  crush him for that.

00:32:02,451 --> 00:32:04,221
Yeah, it is.
  It's a small, little business.

00:32:04,221 --> 00:32:05,892
Why -- Why wouldn't I start
  this myself if I want to be
  in this business?

00:32:05,892 --> 00:32:08,598
You could,

  Well, I'd hire him.

Hi, sharks.

00:32:39,597 --> 00:32:42,603
We're Rick and Melissa hinnant
  from Austin, texas,

00:32:42,603 --> 00:32:45,943
and we're here today to
  knock your socks off, literally.

00:32:45,943 --> 00:32:48,516
Our company is

...that women wear
  under their boots,

00:33:01,309 --> 00:33:04,450
and we've turned it into a Lacy,
  frilly fashion statement.

00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:07,122
Our story starts
  a couple of years ago.

00:33:07,122 --> 00:33:10,596
I had an idea
  for a cute, little, Lacy sock

00:33:10,596 --> 00:33:11,832
that stuck out
  of my boots.

00:33:11,832 --> 00:33:14,739
So after about nine hours
  on the sewing machine

00:33:14,739 --> 00:33:16,609
and a ton of frustration,

00:33:16,609 --> 00:33:18,813
I finally made
  my first pair.

00:33:18,813 --> 00:33:20,852
Everywhere I wore them,

00:33:20,852 --> 00:33:22,722
people would stop me
  and ask me where I got them.

00:33:22,722 --> 00:33:25,428
When I said I made them,
  literally, strangers would

00:33:25,428 --> 00:33:27,398
give me their phone number,
  ask me to make them a pair.

00:33:27,398 --> 00:33:28,835
So I threw up online
  to see if they'd sell.

00:33:28,835 --> 00:33:31,508
They did, instantly.

00:33:31,508 --> 00:33:33,779
Before we knew it,

00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:36,050

if I had the ability
  to make 30,000 to 50,000 pairs.

  exactly what we're asking for,

00:37:56,303 --> 00:37:58,307
but let me see
  what the other guy has to say."

00:37:58,307 --> 00:38:00,244
Of course he has
  that right.
  So for all due respect...

00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:01,581
yes.

00:38:01,581 --> 00:38:03,552
...I'd like an answer
  to my offer.

00:38:03,552 --> 00:38:07,126
And I absolutely want
  to respect you.

00:38:07,126 --> 00:38:09,263
I also want to hear
  everything else.

00:38:09,263 --> 00:38:11,535
And I think, you know,
  being a smart businessman,

00:38:11,535 --> 00:38:12,972
you would understand that,
  as well.

00:38:12,972 --> 00:38:14,475
Would you agree?

00:38:14,475 --> 00:38:17,013
You -- You got to make
  a decision on my deal.

00:38:17,013 --> 00:38:19,119
I mean, I'm --
  I'm happy to pull out...

00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,588
sure.
  ...and let you deal
  with the other guys,

00:38:20,588 --> 00:38:22,325
or I'm happy to
  have you take my deal.
  I'm just --

00:38:22,325 --> 00:38:24,964
I'm just interested in
  hearing what is out there

00:38:24,964 --> 00:38:26,768
so I can make the best educated
  decision for you and me.

00:38:26,768 --> 00:38:29,673
Rick, I gave you
  exactly what you're asking for.

00:38:29,673 --> 00:38:31,411
I understand.
  What is there left to decide?

00:38:33,582 --> 00:38:36,588
In the Shark Tank, we call this
  bone-In-Mouth disease.

00:38:36,588 --> 00:38:39,462
It's a dog looking
  into a pond with a
  bone in their mouth.

00:38:39,462 --> 00:38:41,165
Kevin, I don't -- I don't need
  you to make it better or worse.

00:38:41,165 --> 00:38:42,234
But I'm just telling you
  right now

00:38:42,234 --> 00:38:44,038
it is bone-In-Mouth disease
  right here.

00:38:44,038 --> 00:38:46,476
For the 10% -- Kevin, quiet!
  This is the dilemma
  of the Shark Tank.

00:38:46,476 --> 00:38:48,681
I'm Loving the drama.
  I'm Loving it.
  Quiet!

00:38:48,681 --> 00:38:53,124
It's $175,000 for 10%.
  It's what you asked for.

00:38:53,124 --> 00:38:54,460
Can I ask you
  a few more questions?

00:38:57,098 --> 00:38:58,202
Yes or no?

00:39:07,989 --> 00:39:10,393
Narrator:
  One shark is out.

00:39:10,393 --> 00:39:13,032
Barbara and Kevin
  have offers on the table,

00:39:13,032 --> 00:39:14,903
but Robert
  has offered Rick and Melissa

00:39:14,903 --> 00:39:19,547
exactly what they asked for --
  $175,000 for 10%.

00:39:19,547 --> 00:39:20,949
Yes or No?

00:39:20,949 --> 00:39:23,455
Can I ask you
  a few more questions?

00:39:23,455 --> 00:39:26,595
I've given you
  exactly what you're asking for.

00:39:26,595 --> 00:39:28,766
I'm a very nice guy,

00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:34,144
but don't mistake my kindness
  for weakness.

00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,748
Yes or no?

00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:38,019
Greiner: You guys,
  this is a moment

00:39:38,019 --> 00:39:41,761
that you don't want to
  walk away from and say, "uh-Oh."

00:39:43,932 --> 00:39:46,637
$175,000 for 10%.

00:39:46,637 --> 00:39:48,842
I-I'm happy to go out.

00:39:48,842 --> 00:39:50,412
Can we discuss it outside?

00:39:51,748 --> 00:39:54,254
You guys, you could
  lose this offer.
  Rick, I'm -- I'm --
  I'm out.

00:39:55,323 --> 00:39:57,360
O'Leary: Oh!
  [ groans ]

00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,863
you know why I like that?

00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:00,434
Because your options
  are lessened.

00:40:00,434 --> 00:40:02,738
And I would actually do the deal
  that I offered to you.

00:40:04,575 --> 00:40:07,114
Cuban: Look, I like
  what you guys are doing.

00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:10,121
Question is, where are you gonna
  need the most amount of help?

00:40:10,121 --> 00:40:11,958
So when you
  did your projections --

00:40:11,958 --> 00:40:14,129
$1 million, $5 million,
  $10 million, $100 million --

00:40:14,129 --> 00:40:16,468
What were the pain points
  where you said,

00:40:16,468 --> 00:40:18,138
"Oh, my goodness, how am I
  gonna get through this?"

00:40:18,138 --> 00:40:19,307
that's what I want to know.

00:40:19,307 --> 00:40:21,912
We're not looking to suck
  a ton of your time,

00:40:21,912 --> 00:40:23,950
because we understand
  time is the only commodity

00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:26,589
that we can't
  get more of.
  Amen.

00:40:26,589 --> 00:40:28,192
So I'm looking to be able
  to call and say,

00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:30,296
"Hey, you know,
  we're at the $5 million mark,

00:40:30,296 --> 00:40:33,337
"and we are gonna expand
  this year to $10 million.

00:40:33,337 --> 00:40:34,907
What should we be doing?"

00:40:36,276 --> 00:40:39,483
Okay, I'll offer you
  $175,000 for 10%.

00:40:39,483 --> 00:40:41,621
But I need to know right now
  yes or No.

00:40:44,995 --> 00:40:48,034
Can we talk about it
  in the hallway?

00:40:48,034 --> 00:40:50,173
Corcoran: Wow.

00:40:50,173 --> 00:40:52,444
There's a difference
  between trying to gather

00:40:52,444 --> 00:40:53,980
as much information as you can
  and indecision.

00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:57,555
There are gonna be many
  times in the evolution
  of your business

00:40:57,555 --> 00:40:58,925
where you can't be indecisive,

00:40:58,925 --> 00:41:00,595
and right now
  you're demonstrating

00:41:00,595 --> 00:41:02,164
that you're
  being indecisive.

00:41:02,164 --> 00:41:04,068
Yeah, but we came in
  with a strategy,

00:41:04,068 --> 00:41:05,505
and we knew
  who we wanted,

00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:07,910
so it wasn't indecisive --
  Not at all.

00:41:09,647 --> 00:41:11,251
I'm going to revise
  my offer.

00:41:13,355 --> 00:41:14,591
I'm gonna change the offer

00:41:14,591 --> 00:41:17,263
to give you exactly
  what you asked for,

00:41:17,263 --> 00:41:19,535
but half of the money
  is going to be a line of credit.

00:41:24,011 --> 00:41:27,886
Okay.
  So what's the answer?

00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:38,408
The answer is We would love
  to do business with Barbara.

00:41:38,408 --> 00:41:39,678
We think that she
  brings the most.
  O'Leary: Whoa.

00:41:39,678 --> 00:41:42,584
You know what? You picked
  the smartest person here.

00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:44,822
Good decision.

00:41:44,822 --> 00:41:46,893
I think it was
  a very good decision.
  Thank you.

00:41:46,893 --> 00:41:49,465
Thank you.
  Terrifically done.
  You were great under pressure.

00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,135
Thank you.
  Terrific together.

00:41:51,135 --> 00:41:54,108
We -- we came in with
  a plan, and sometimes
  it works out, right?

00:41:54,108 --> 00:41:56,079
Herjavec: Nice job.
  O'Leary: Congratulations.
  Greiner: Good luck.

00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:57,749
Rick: Thank you, guys.
  Best of luck to you.
  Melissa: Thank you, guys.

00:41:57,749 --> 00:41:59,018
Greiner: Congratulations.
  Good luck in retail.

00:41:59,018 --> 00:42:01,357
Whew!
  Can you believe it?

00:42:01,357 --> 00:42:02,927
Holy cow!

00:42:02,927 --> 00:42:04,898
We went with our gut,
  and it worked out,

00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:07,170
with the exact partner
  that we wanted.
  Yeah.

00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:09,040
Absolutely incredible.
  It couldn't have gone better.

00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,009
We did it!

00:42:10,009 --> 00:42:11,245
Melissa:
  I think Barbara just has

00:42:11,245 --> 00:42:12,447
the same kind of type
  of thinking that we do,

00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:14,719
and she just has
  that go-Get-'em attitude,

00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:17,024
and I think that we'll just pair
  really well with her.
  Mm-hmm.

00:42:17,024 --> 00:42:19,295
They were
  great negotiators.
  Well, they just do
  what they wanted.

00:42:19,295 --> 00:42:20,531
They should have
  just asked for Barbara

00:42:20,531 --> 00:42:21,767
is what
  they should have done.
  That's all right.

00:42:21,767 --> 00:42:23,709
You know what?
  They were sharks wearing socks.

00:42:23,709 --> 00:42:25,244
[ laughter ]
  I don't know
  if they were sharks.

00:42:25,244 --> 00:42:26,345
Well said.
