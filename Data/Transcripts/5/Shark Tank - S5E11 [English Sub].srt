00:00:02,405 --> 00:00:04,510
Narrator:
  This is the Shark Tank,
  where hopeful entrepreneurs

00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,249
get a once-in-a-Lifetime chance
  to pitch the sharks

00:00:07,249 --> 00:00:08,919
in hopes of
  getting an investment

00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:11,925
to start, grow,
  or save their businesses.

00:00:11,925 --> 00:00:13,528
Do you see
  adults wearing this?

00:00:13,528 --> 00:00:16,133
Absolutely.
  To date, we have
  $9.3 million worth of sales.

00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:17,068
Herjavec:
  What?!
  whoa!

00:00:17,068 --> 00:00:18,972
They don't look
  so stupid now.

00:00:18,972 --> 00:00:20,743
Narrator: The entrepreneurs
  must convince a shark

00:00:20,743 --> 00:00:23,048
to invest the full amount
  they're asking for,

00:00:23,048 --> 00:00:25,219
or they'll
  walk away with nothing.

00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:26,756
I hate this product.
  Oh, my gosh.

00:00:26,756 --> 00:00:28,492
People are calling me
  all the time, "Can you send --"

00:00:28,492 --> 00:00:29,962
they don't want it!
  They're not buying it!

00:00:29,962 --> 00:00:31,799
They are buying it!

00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:33,703
You've got to wake up
  and smell the bankruptcy, okay?

00:00:33,703 --> 00:00:35,941
[ laughter ]
  Narrator: If the sharks
  hear a great idea...

00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:37,010
reow!

00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,279
Narrator:
  ...they're ready to invest...

00:00:38,279 --> 00:00:39,348
Oh, wow!

00:00:39,348 --> 00:00:40,450
...using their own money.

00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,387
I want 50%.

00:00:42,387 --> 00:00:43,456
Narrator: And they're willing
  to fight each other

00:00:43,456 --> 00:00:45,360
for a piece
  of the action.

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,632
This greedy Savage --
  His deal is horrible.

00:00:47,632 --> 00:00:49,402
O'Leary: He's never done
  a deal like this.

00:00:49,402 --> 00:00:51,607
Excuse me.
  I'm the man.

00:00:51,607 --> 00:00:53,210
And I want you and I
  to de-Bone this pig together.

00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,814
[ laughs ]

00:00:54,814 --> 00:00:57,418
and then what -- what would you
  see for the brand itself?

00:00:57,418 --> 00:00:59,790
Money.

00:01:00,425 --> 00:01:02,061
Narrator:
  Who are the sharks?

00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,638
They're self-Made millionaire
  and billionaire investors

00:01:06,638 --> 00:01:09,110
who are entrepreneurs
  themselves.

00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,782
Kevin O'Leary
  is a venture capitalist

00:01:11,782 --> 00:01:13,686
who turned a $10,000 loan

00:01:13,686 --> 00:01:18,295
into a software business
  worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:19,931 --> 00:01:22,938
Barbara Corcoran went
  from waiting tables in manhattan

00:01:22,938 --> 00:01:26,746
to building the city's
  preeminent real-estate empire.

00:01:26,746 --> 00:01:29,184
Daymond John is
  a fashion and branding expert

00:01:29,184 --> 00:01:31,221
Who grew
  his homemade clothing line

00:01:31,221 --> 00:01:34,495
into the globally recognized
  fashion brand Fubu,

00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:37,835
with over $6 billion
  in retail sales to date.

00:01:37,835 --> 00:01:41,042
Robert Herjavec, the son
  of an immigrant factory worker,

00:01:41,042 --> 00:01:43,013
is now a technology mogul

00:01:43,013 --> 00:01:44,783
Who sold his
  first internet companies

00:01:44,783 --> 00:01:48,291
for over $350 million.

00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:51,731
And Mark Cuban -- notorious
  billionaire entrepreneur,

00:01:51,731 --> 00:01:53,167
tech guru,

00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:56,173
and the outspoken owner
  of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.

00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:08,232
First into the tank

00:02:08,232 --> 00:02:12,173
is a fashionable way
  to bring out your inner animal.

00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,592
What's up,
  sharks?

00:02:21,592 --> 00:02:23,163
My name is
  Alexander Mendeluk.

00:02:23,163 --> 00:02:24,331
I'm Marley Marotta.

00:02:24,331 --> 00:02:26,169
And we are the co-creators
  of Spirithoods.

00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:30,010
We're seeking $450,000
  for a 15% stake in our company.

00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,282
Our product brings the
  adventurous spirit of the wild

00:02:32,282 --> 00:02:33,651
into everyday life

00:02:33,651 --> 00:02:36,390
while helping to protect
  endangered animals.

00:02:40,198 --> 00:02:41,033
Reow!

00:02:47,045 --> 00:02:50,152
That happens every time
  you wear a spirithood.

00:02:50,152 --> 00:02:51,956
[ laughter ]

00:02:51,956 --> 00:02:53,358
Can we see
  that demo again?

00:02:53,358 --> 00:02:54,493
John: Very nice.

00:02:54,493 --> 00:02:55,897
But we're more
  than a hat company.

00:02:55,897 --> 00:02:58,235
We're
  a lifestyle brand.

00:02:58,235 --> 00:03:00,707
And as a brand, we're about
  community, self-Expression,

00:03:00,707 --> 00:03:02,577
and just all around
  having a good time.

00:03:02,577 --> 00:03:06,485
We have products for adults,
  kids, and sports markets.

00:03:06,485 --> 00:03:08,289
This is
  a traditional spirithood.

00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:10,193
It has paws
  for your hands...

00:03:10,193 --> 00:03:12,197
Cuban:
  [ laughing ]
  Corcoran:
  Oh, my gosh.

00:03:12,197 --> 00:03:13,032
Oh, yeah.
  ...sleeves that can
  be turned into a scarf.

00:03:13,032 --> 00:03:14,201
John:
  Oh, my God.

00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:15,337
Ooh, nice, thank you.

00:03:15,337 --> 00:03:17,608
It can worn up,
  it can be worn down.

00:03:17,608 --> 00:03:20,648
There's also a button here
  to secure it to your head.

00:03:20,648 --> 00:03:22,385
And then,
  on the inside,

00:03:22,385 --> 00:03:23,755
there's a hidden
  secret zipper pocket.

00:03:23,755 --> 00:03:26,961
That Hood actually has built-In
  machine-Washable speakers.

00:03:26,961 --> 00:03:28,965
So all you have to do
  is pull your phone out,

00:03:28,965 --> 00:03:31,270
you just pull the cord out
  right here,

00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,441
press play, and you've
  got music in your head.

00:03:33,441 --> 00:03:35,211
Wait, wait.
  I'm chopped liver?

00:03:35,211 --> 00:03:37,516
[ whistles ]

00:03:37,516 --> 00:03:39,386
introducing,
  ladies and gentlemen,

00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,123
the era
  of the new fanimal.

00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,967
Picture in the stands
  30,000 fans

00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:48,739
All rocking
  their team Spirithoods.

00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:51,044
I'm not feeling
  this one.
  So the team spirithood
  line is --

00:03:51,044 --> 00:03:52,915
is our latest addition
  to the company.

00:03:52,915 --> 00:03:54,785
Do you see
  adults wearing this?

00:03:54,785 --> 00:03:56,355
Absolutely.
  Absolutely. Um --

00:03:56,355 --> 00:03:58,560
the bulk of our sales
  are to adults.

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,764
I don't care who buys them.
  What are the sales?

00:04:00,764 --> 00:04:03,570
To date, we have
  $9.3 million worth of sales.

00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,140
Yeah! That's
  what I'm talking about.
  What?!

00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,542
whoa!
  Corcoran: Unbelievable.

00:04:06,542 --> 00:04:07,846
Good for you guys.
  Come on!

00:04:07,846 --> 00:04:08,948
You got to be kidding.
  Marotta: 100% fact.

00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:10,785
They don't look
  so stupid now.
  No.

00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:12,187
No, they don't.

00:04:12,187 --> 00:04:14,393
We launched the product
  in 2010 at magic trade show.

00:04:14,393 --> 00:04:16,897
We opened about
  35 different Accounts

00:04:16,897 --> 00:04:19,102
both domestically
  and internationally, and --

00:04:19,102 --> 00:04:21,273
any of
  the major accounts?

00:04:21,273 --> 00:04:24,847
We are currently in Zappos,
  Nordstrom's online, in Harrods,

00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,383
we've been carried
  in Fred Segal.

00:04:26,383 --> 00:04:27,486
And is this
  a seasonal sales

00:04:27,486 --> 00:04:28,989
that build around
  Halloween or Christmas,

00:04:28,989 --> 00:04:31,361
and then you kind of tail off
  the rest of the year?

00:04:31,361 --> 00:04:33,165
Well, the cold --
  The cold-weather months
  are our months.

00:04:33,165 --> 00:04:36,638
So, basically,
  we do 70% of our sales

00:04:36,638 --> 00:04:38,241
from September
  through December.

00:04:38,241 --> 00:04:40,179
What is the price?
  What is the price
  for an average --

00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:42,951
So, for a-a-a basic hood
  like that,

00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:44,721
our price point
  is $99.

00:04:44,721 --> 00:04:46,592
$99?
  John:
  That's a lot.

00:04:46,592 --> 00:04:48,162
Now, these -- These
  are synthetic, correct?

00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,298
These are all faux fur.

00:04:49,298 --> 00:04:50,868
So if this sells for $99,

00:04:50,868 --> 00:04:52,872
what does it
  cost you to make?

00:04:52,872 --> 00:04:55,410
On average, it costs
  about $29 to produce.

00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,913
Wow.
  That's made -- Made
  in Los Angeles.

00:04:56,913 --> 00:04:58,317
Mendeluk:
  Yeah.
  Great margin.

00:04:58,317 --> 00:05:00,187
Yeah.
  What were your sales
  last year?

00:05:00,187 --> 00:05:02,258
I know that you did $9 million
  over three years.

00:05:02,258 --> 00:05:04,295
What were they last year
  and the year before?

00:05:04,295 --> 00:05:07,535
The first year, we had
  $1 million that we launched,

00:05:07,535 --> 00:05:11,076
and the second year,
  we had $4.5 million in sales.

00:05:11,076 --> 00:05:13,046
And then the third year,
  we had $3 million.

00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,483
Oh. Ooh.

00:05:14,483 --> 00:05:16,053
Hmm.
  And we're on track
  to do $3 million again.

00:05:16,053 --> 00:05:17,689
O'Leary: What happened?
  What happened?

00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:20,362
We had a big explosion,
  a lot of early adapters,

00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,734
and then after that, we were
  left with a core business,

00:05:22,734 --> 00:05:24,538
which has
  basically petered out

00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:26,608
about $3 million
  steadily every year.

00:05:26,608 --> 00:05:28,579
Do you think it's a fad?
  Is that why?

00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:29,714
No, I think that --
  I think that --

00:05:29,714 --> 00:05:30,816
Well, of course
  it's a fad,

00:05:30,816 --> 00:05:31,986
but -- but -- but how
  do you replenish it

00:05:31,986 --> 00:05:32,754
and refresh this, right?

00:05:32,754 --> 00:05:33,957
It was a trend

00:05:33,957 --> 00:05:36,896
within the contemporary
  women's fashion market, yes.

00:05:36,896 --> 00:05:38,132
But, again,
  we expand --

00:05:38,132 --> 00:05:39,902
Many different markets,
  into

00:05:39,902 --> 00:05:42,106
but we have a core business
  that was left from that

00:05:42,106 --> 00:05:43,376
that followed
  the brand,

00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,347
because they love
  what we stand for, what we do.

00:05:45,347 --> 00:05:47,351
You never finished off
  your profitability.

00:05:47,351 --> 00:05:49,088
You did $4.5 million
  your best year.

00:05:49,088 --> 00:05:51,192
How much did you make
  that year?

00:05:51,192 --> 00:05:53,698
So the year where we made
  $4.5 million,

00:05:53,698 --> 00:05:56,069
we actually had $914,000
  worth of profit.

00:05:56,069 --> 00:05:57,706
John: Wow.
  And what about last year
  at $3 million?

00:05:57,706 --> 00:05:59,643
Last year at $3 million,
  we actually had a --

00:05:59,643 --> 00:06:00,945
we had -- We ran into
  some challenges,

00:06:00,945 --> 00:06:02,782
and we had
  a $500,000 loss.

00:06:02,782 --> 00:06:03,885
John: Mm.
  Whoa.

00:06:03,885 --> 00:06:05,789
Corcoran: Wow.
  $500,000
  or $600,000 loss?

00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:07,660
Herjavec: Why?
  Sounds like
  you got skinned that year.

00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,996
[ laughs ]
  Yeah, yeah.
  We got skinned for sure.

00:06:08,996 --> 00:06:10,332
We hired
  a lot of people

00:06:10,332 --> 00:06:11,801
because we wanted
  to expand

00:06:11,801 --> 00:06:13,605
into all these
  different markets immediately.

00:06:13,605 --> 00:06:15,042
We started
  branching into apparel.

00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,578
You're hot.
  You want to go with it.
  John: Yeah.

00:06:16,578 --> 00:06:17,680
We went --
  We went -- and We went

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,850
too big
  for our own britches.

00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,185
But what we've now done
  is cut our costs,

00:06:20,185 --> 00:06:22,323
focused on what we do best,
  which is this,

00:06:22,323 --> 00:06:23,826
and, you know,
  you had mentioned that,

00:06:23,826 --> 00:06:25,195
okay, it's
  a downward trend.

00:06:25,195 --> 00:06:27,099
Well, actually,
  our online sales this year

00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:29,138
are stronger
  than they were last year.

00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:32,711
However, we do see
  a lot of potential for growth.

00:06:32,711 --> 00:06:34,114
We just realized
  that we'd need

00:06:34,114 --> 00:06:35,483
to lock
  what we do best first.

00:06:35,483 --> 00:06:37,989
Somebody must've knocked
  you guys off, right?
  Many.

00:06:37,989 --> 00:06:39,224
Marotta:
  Uh, yeah. There was --

00:06:39,224 --> 00:06:40,761
Yeah, y-Y-You've probably seen
  quite a few of them

00:06:40,761 --> 00:06:41,963
out in the market
  right now.

00:06:41,963 --> 00:06:43,967
I've seen
  a lot for kids.
  Yeah.
  Yeah.

00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:46,473
But one of the main
  things, again, I want to
  get to is the reason

00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:48,377
why we've sustained,
  kind of, the storm

00:06:48,377 --> 00:06:49,714
is because of the brand,
  the brand, the brand.

00:06:49,714 --> 00:06:51,718
We have people
  who've literally

00:06:51,718 --> 00:06:53,253
tattooed our logos
  on their bodies.

00:06:53,253 --> 00:06:54,423
And I'm saying
  multiple.

00:06:54,423 --> 00:06:57,095
Like, that's how fanatic
  our -- our tribe is.

00:06:57,095 --> 00:06:59,633
I've never seen a product
  that elicits a response
  like this.

00:06:59,633 --> 00:07:00,970
That --
  People are literally
  wanting to pet you,

00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,373
take pictures with you,
  they want to --

00:07:02,373 --> 00:07:03,709
that -- that is
  a big factor of this product.
  Yeah.

00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:05,512
It's the only thing
  you could walk into a bar

00:07:05,512 --> 00:07:07,015
and girls come up to you
  and start petting you.

00:07:07,015 --> 00:07:10,356
And what do you want to use
  the $450,000 for?

00:07:10,356 --> 00:07:11,859
We could stay
  right now

00:07:11,859 --> 00:07:13,027
with a viable
  $3-million business,

00:07:13,027 --> 00:07:14,431
pay off Our debt
  next year,

00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:17,604
have maybe about $500,000
  in profit,

00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,143
but what we really want to do
  is we want to grow the company.

00:07:20,143 --> 00:07:23,617
The teams line we see as
  one of the main places
  for large potential.

00:07:23,617 --> 00:07:25,119
Guys, let me
  take a shot at it.

00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:27,324
I look at it as an interesting
  fashion statement,

00:07:27,324 --> 00:07:29,930
but it's not proprietary --
  Anybody can do it.

00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,635
It scares me to see a year
  $4.5 million down to $3 million,

00:07:32,635 --> 00:07:35,507
and then you're gonna
  build it up in a new Category.

00:07:35,507 --> 00:07:37,979
Look, I'm not gonna take
  the ride with you. I'm out.

00:07:39,817 --> 00:07:41,187
Good business, guys.

00:07:41,187 --> 00:07:43,558
I mean, great answers
  to all the questions.

00:07:43,558 --> 00:07:45,094
You really look like a shark
  right now, Robert.

00:07:45,094 --> 00:07:46,197
[ laughter ]

00:07:46,197 --> 00:07:48,067
Herjavec:
  I love how you came up with it,

00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:50,539
but I actually invested
  in a company

00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:53,846
that made really cool things
  like this for helmets.

00:07:53,846 --> 00:07:54,814
Mm-hmm.

00:07:54,814 --> 00:07:57,220
And here's
  what happened to us.

00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,557
Two years,
  we were on fire...

00:07:59,557 --> 00:08:02,898
and then the sales
  went completely away.
  Mm-hmm.

00:08:02,898 --> 00:08:05,035
That worries me about it, but
  there's nothing wrong with that.

00:08:05,035 --> 00:08:07,975
There's nothing wrong
  with starting a business,

00:08:07,975 --> 00:08:10,180
taking out
  a whack of cash...
  Mm-hmm.

00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,115
...and then
  starting something else.

00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,818
Mm-hmm.

00:08:12,818 --> 00:08:13,786
I'm out.

00:08:13,786 --> 00:08:16,058
Thank you.
  You look good in it.

00:08:16,058 --> 00:08:17,327
[ Laughter ]
  can I keep it?

00:08:17,327 --> 00:08:18,363
Absolutely.

00:08:18,363 --> 00:08:20,267
Corcoran: I think
  the best use of it,

00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:21,770
you mentioned earlier,
  is as a chick magnet.

00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,507
You walk into a bar
  with that on,

00:08:23,507 --> 00:08:25,378
I'm gonna go over to you and
  think you're an adorable guy.

00:08:25,378 --> 00:08:27,582
[ purrs ]
  I'm not sure
  I'm gonna want to date you...

00:08:27,582 --> 00:08:29,753
wow.
  ...but it's
  a great chick magnet.

00:08:29,753 --> 00:08:30,655
It really is.

00:08:30,655 --> 00:08:32,125
But you know what?

00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,162
I like to buy into businesses
  that are rising, not falling.

00:08:34,162 --> 00:08:35,331
So I'm out.

00:08:35,331 --> 00:08:38,338
Yeah.
  All right, thank you.
  Thank you.

00:08:39,974 --> 00:08:41,043
There are
  millions of people

00:08:41,043 --> 00:08:42,279
who haven't seen
  the product yet,

00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,782
and that's one of the reasons
  why we're here.

00:08:43,782 --> 00:08:46,054
Guys, you've got
  a nice little business, right?

00:08:46,054 --> 00:08:48,826
But the thing
  about it is, I --

00:08:48,826 --> 00:08:51,130
It's too expensive
  for me to sell.

00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,903
What would be a good price point
  for you?
  $19.95.

00:08:53,903 --> 00:08:56,040
Then maybe I could sell
  a couple hundred in the Arena,

00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,310
and you'll see
  some folks walking around.

00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:59,681
And I-I don't think
  you can get the price point

00:08:59,681 --> 00:09:00,951
where I can help you
  in sports,

00:09:00,951 --> 00:09:03,422
and I just don't see it,
  so I'm out.

00:09:03,422 --> 00:09:07,798
And you're left with the only
  shark that matters in this case.

00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:09,869
[ laughter ]
  Daymond is still here.

00:09:09,869 --> 00:09:12,341
Thank you for the pressure,
  Rob. How --
  Herjavec: Bang.

00:09:12,341 --> 00:09:14,145
And he loves
  this kind of stuff.
  How colorful.

00:09:14,145 --> 00:09:16,516
Daymond, the fashion guy
  who started with hats.

00:09:16,516 --> 00:09:17,418
Did he
  say that?
  I know!
  I know!

00:09:17,418 --> 00:09:18,621
John: I did.
  Oh, we know that.

00:09:18,621 --> 00:09:20,458
We've done
  our research.
  Yeah, yeah.

00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:21,961
You know, and I would like
  to draw a comparison,

00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,297
because you know what it's like
  to have an idea

00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:24,533
and see something
  in the market

00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:26,504
and pound the streets,
  put it on your friends.

00:09:26,504 --> 00:09:28,307
You know, we did
  the same type of thing.

00:09:28,307 --> 00:09:30,145
We got celebrity exposure.
  The brand grew.

00:09:30,145 --> 00:09:33,752
We've been on Bruno Mars,
  Snoop Dogg, ke$ha, Kardashians,

00:09:33,752 --> 00:09:36,123
Justin Bieber --
  The list goes on.

00:09:36,123 --> 00:09:38,395
Here's the --
  the bigger problem.

00:09:38,395 --> 00:09:40,766
This brand
  and this -- this category

00:09:40,766 --> 00:09:42,537
are hot for a second,
  is down-Trending.

00:09:42,537 --> 00:09:43,907
I would have to take
  a gamble with you,

00:09:43,907 --> 00:09:46,144
and it would be --
  it would be --

00:09:46,144 --> 00:09:47,581
Let's take a risk.
  Let's do it together.

00:09:47,581 --> 00:09:49,050
Well, I don't know if you'll
  want to take the risk with me,

00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,121
because my risk
  is gonna be $450,000,

00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:54,060
and we're gonna license
  this thing out, and I want 50%.

00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:57,835
50%.

00:09:57,835 --> 00:09:59,105
Ba-bam.

00:09:59,105 --> 00:10:00,006
Whoo-Wee!

00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:14,871
Narrator:
  Four sharks are out.

00:10:14,871 --> 00:10:17,710
Marley and Alexander
  have an offer from Daymond,

00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,547
but it's an aggressive one.

00:10:19,547 --> 00:10:21,183
I would have to take
  a gamble with you,

00:10:21,183 --> 00:10:22,620
and it would be --
  it would be --

00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,055
Let's take a risk.
  Let's do it together.

00:10:24,055 --> 00:10:26,060
Well, I don't know if you'll
  want to take the risk with me,

00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,131
because my risk
  is gonna be $450,000,

00:10:28,131 --> 00:10:31,070
and we're gonna license
  this thing out, and I want 50%.

00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:33,976
50%.

00:10:33,976 --> 00:10:34,912
Ba-Bam.

00:10:34,912 --> 00:10:37,651
Whoo-Wee!

00:10:37,651 --> 00:10:40,156
Yeah, I want to license out
  all categories,

00:10:40,156 --> 00:10:41,927
and the pricing
  will have to come down.

00:10:41,927 --> 00:10:44,231
I want outerwear, backpacks,

00:10:44,231 --> 00:10:46,603
and we want to try to find
  licenses for that

00:10:46,603 --> 00:10:48,072
and get that out there
  to support the brand.

00:10:48,072 --> 00:10:50,511
You see, when I first started
  making hats,

00:10:50,511 --> 00:10:54,085
the hats only lasted,
  literally, a year.

00:10:54,085 --> 00:10:55,487
Other than that,
  I had to move

00:10:55,487 --> 00:10:58,327
into outerwear and t-Shirts
  and Denim and everything else,

00:10:58,327 --> 00:11:00,264
because the hats
  were in and out --
  they were gone.

00:11:00,264 --> 00:11:01,701
Yeah.

00:11:01,701 --> 00:11:04,272
And then what -- what would you
  see for the brand itself?

00:11:04,272 --> 00:11:05,609
Money.

00:11:05,609 --> 00:11:07,679
[ laughter ]

00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:10,051
Guys, you've got a really nice
  warm and fuzzy offer here.

00:11:10,051 --> 00:11:11,787
That's not
  a warm and fuzzy offer.

00:11:11,787 --> 00:11:13,024
Yes, it is.
  $450,000 cash.
  You know
  what it's missing?

00:11:13,024 --> 00:11:14,628
Barbara,
  shut your pie hole.

00:11:14,628 --> 00:11:16,430
You know what it's --
  Barbara's not in this!
  Barbara is not in this.

00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,435
You know what it's missing?
  It's missing any promise,

00:11:18,435 --> 00:11:21,241
any conciseness of how much
  he expects to make for you.

00:11:21,241 --> 00:11:23,212
He hasn't given you
  a single number.

00:11:23,212 --> 00:11:25,182
He risked $450,000!
  And yet he wants --

00:11:25,182 --> 00:11:26,418
if he's so good
  at what he's doing,

00:11:26,418 --> 00:11:28,355
he should be able
  to give you

00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:29,792
an estimate
  of what he's gonna bring in.
  You're not even in
  on this deal!

00:11:29,792 --> 00:11:31,361
That's why
  I'm speaking honestly.

00:11:31,361 --> 00:11:33,366
Can we have a moment to go back
  and talk for a little bit?
  Two seconds?

00:11:33,366 --> 00:11:34,936
You know what happens when you
  go back and talk, right?

00:11:34,936 --> 00:11:36,071
What happens?

00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:37,241
You get eaten alive.
  Bad things happen.

00:11:37,241 --> 00:11:38,243
[ chuckles ]
  You know,
  you've watched the show.

00:11:38,243 --> 00:11:39,812
People have left
  that carpet --

00:11:39,812 --> 00:11:42,384
don't worry about it.
  Leave the ladies here,
  and go ahead out.

00:11:42,384 --> 00:11:43,988
[ Laughter ]
  Thank you.
  Appreciate it.

00:11:49,366 --> 00:11:51,937
So, $435,000.

00:11:51,937 --> 00:11:54,376
And he's gonna license it out
  into everything else,

00:11:54,376 --> 00:11:55,478
and then who knows

00:11:55,478 --> 00:11:57,248
what's gonna happen
  to the brand name?

00:11:57,248 --> 00:12:00,388
Do we want him
  to just take our brand

00:12:00,388 --> 00:12:02,793
and license it out
  to all these different people?

00:12:02,793 --> 00:12:03,962
I actually thought
  that was a good offer.

00:12:03,962 --> 00:12:05,098
O'Leary: That's
  a very reasonable offer.

00:12:05,098 --> 00:12:06,835
Hey, it's a gamble.
  Yeah.

00:12:06,835 --> 00:12:08,205
It's a gamble for them,
  not for you.

00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:09,908
Why? Are you kidding?
  It's a big gamble
  for him.

00:12:09,908 --> 00:12:11,411
Why is it not for me?
  It can easily go to zero.
  Sales are going way down.

00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:13,115
Yeah, this thing goes to zero,
  I'm out of $450,000, Barbara.

00:12:13,115 --> 00:12:14,117
You don't think
  that's a gamble?

00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,934
So, Marley and Alex,
  your sales went down.

00:12:22,934 --> 00:12:25,440
You scared most sharks away
  except for Daymond,

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,110
who knows
  your industry...

00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:29,749
except he wants, for $450,000,

00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:33,924
50% of your business.

00:12:33,924 --> 00:12:36,096
What are you going to do?

00:12:36,096 --> 00:12:40,638
We're not prepared to evaluate
  our company that low,

00:12:40,638 --> 00:12:43,477
but what
  we are prepared to do

00:12:43,477 --> 00:12:48,988
is give a $2 million evaluation
  for 22.5%,

00:12:48,988 --> 00:12:51,928
but then a particular percentage
  on licensing deals

00:12:51,928 --> 00:12:53,565
that you bring
  into the situation.

00:12:55,335 --> 00:12:58,007
Okay, well, I mean,
  that's the beauty of the tank.

00:12:58,007 --> 00:13:00,178
When you go out to think,
  I start to think,

00:13:00,178 --> 00:13:01,715
and I already have
  buyer's remorse,

00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:02,851
and I didn't even buy it.

00:13:02,851 --> 00:13:06,158
So I wasn't ready
  to renegotiate the deal.

00:13:06,158 --> 00:13:06,993
I'm out.

00:13:10,233 --> 00:13:12,036
Thank you guys.
  Thank you.

00:13:12,036 --> 00:13:13,405
We appreciate
  the opportunity.
  Appreciate it.

00:13:13,405 --> 00:13:14,307
Good luck, guys.
  Yeah, take it easy.

00:13:14,307 --> 00:13:14,976
Herjavec:
  Thanks, guys.

00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:20,487
Mendeluk: I'm actually stoked
  that we didn't go that low

00:13:20,487 --> 00:13:22,959
and that we still have
  our company to show for it.

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,963
Absolutely. 100%.
  So, good work, dude.

00:13:35,752 --> 00:13:39,726
Man: Joining me is billionaire
  entrepreneur Mr. Mark Cuban.

00:13:39,726 --> 00:13:42,132
[ cheers and applause ]
  Let's give it up
  for Daymond John.

00:13:42,132 --> 00:13:44,436
Cuban: We're at
  the kingonomics conference

00:13:44,436 --> 00:13:45,940
in celebration
  of entrepreneurship

00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,008
and the 50th anniversary

00:13:47,008 --> 00:13:49,547
of the Martin Luther King
  March on D.C.,

00:13:49,547 --> 00:13:52,019
and it's a unique opportunity
  for Daymond and I

00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:54,825
to help minority entrepreneurs
  understand the American dream

00:13:54,825 --> 00:13:56,862
and get fired up
  about starting companies,

00:13:56,862 --> 00:13:59,133
running companies,
  and hopefully making some money.

00:13:59,133 --> 00:14:00,971
Information
  is the most valuable commodity.

00:14:00,971 --> 00:14:03,710
The kingonomic conference
  aims to give entrepreneurs --

00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,447
Primarily
  minority entrepreneurs --

00:14:05,447 --> 00:14:07,117
access to capital
  and information

00:14:07,117 --> 00:14:09,121
on how to build
  a successful business.

00:14:09,121 --> 00:14:10,658
I'm somebody who benefited

00:14:10,658 --> 00:14:13,296
off of supporting
  of minority entrepreneurship,

00:14:13,296 --> 00:14:14,499
and now I can help others.

00:14:14,499 --> 00:14:15,801
[ cheers and Applause ]
  Daymond,
  thank you.

00:14:15,801 --> 00:14:18,139
Woman: welcome to
  "Shark Tank" Casting.

00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:19,509
Thanks for having us here.

00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:21,079
Cuban:
  Maybe not everybody knows --

00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:23,083
the sharks have nothing to do
  with who comes on the show.

00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,887
All we really know
  is their first name

00:14:24,887 --> 00:14:26,156
when they walk
  into the Shark Tank.

00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,593
So, tell me Real quick --

00:14:27,593 --> 00:14:29,362
What's the name of your company,
  how much are you looking for?

00:14:29,362 --> 00:14:31,834
Salvers: We are here
  at the kingonomics conference.

00:14:31,834 --> 00:14:33,638
We're looking
  for great businesses,

00:14:33,638 --> 00:14:35,842
great products,
  great ideas for "Shark Tank."

00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:37,313
If you had the restroom kit,

00:14:37,313 --> 00:14:39,650
you have everything you need
  right in your hand.

00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:40,787
Cuban:
  You know, on "Shark Tank,"

00:14:40,787 --> 00:14:41,689
we like to talk about,

00:14:41,689 --> 00:14:42,891
"Oh, it's all about the money,"

00:14:42,891 --> 00:14:44,394
but it's not always
  about the money.

00:14:44,394 --> 00:14:46,465
There's so many different ways
  to impact the world,

00:14:46,465 --> 00:14:48,469
and if we can give someone
  the confidence

00:14:48,469 --> 00:14:50,941
to have their dreams come True,
  then it's a good day,

00:14:50,941 --> 00:14:52,978
and we've accomplished
  something to be proud of.

00:14:52,978 --> 00:14:56,085
John:
  Entrepreneurship resonates with
  minorities for many reasons,

00:14:56,085 --> 00:15:00,159
but the good thing is there's
  no color when making money.

00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:02,898
And everybody can be a part
  of the American dream.

00:15:11,884 --> 00:15:14,590
Narrator: Next into the tank
  is a high-tech way

00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:17,396
to transport you
  to an alternate reality.

00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:29,754
Hello, sharks.
  My name is Jan Goetelvk.

00:15:29,754 --> 00:15:31,224
I am from Houston, texas.

00:15:31,224 --> 00:15:33,228
Our company is Virtuix,
  and we are seeking

00:15:33,228 --> 00:15:36,301
$2 million in exchange
  for 10% of our company.

00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:39,407
This is the Omni --

00:15:39,407 --> 00:15:42,714
The first-Ever
  virtual-Reality platform

00:15:42,714 --> 00:15:45,119
that allows you to be
  truly a part of the video game.

00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:47,858
The Omni is
  an Omnidirectional treadmill,

00:15:47,858 --> 00:15:49,361
but we removed
  all the moving parts.

00:15:49,361 --> 00:15:51,399
It's basically
  a low-friction surface

00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:53,904
on which the user walks
  with these special shoes

00:15:53,904 --> 00:15:55,641
that have
  a low-friction sole.

00:15:55,641 --> 00:15:57,311
Steve will also
  put on a support belt,

00:15:57,311 --> 00:15:58,380
which provides safety.

00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,783
You can't fall
  on the Omni.

00:15:59,783 --> 00:16:01,453
Also provides some support

00:16:01,453 --> 00:16:03,157
so you can use
  the Omni hands-free

00:16:03,157 --> 00:16:05,595
so you can hold a controller
  or a gun in your hands.

00:16:05,595 --> 00:16:08,400
The Omni can be played
  with Any existing game

00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,737
that uses keyboard input.

00:16:09,737 --> 00:16:10,873
Once you're in the Omni,

00:16:10,873 --> 00:16:12,710
you can put on
  the virtual-reality glasses.

00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:15,449
Oh, cool.
  This is right up
  your alley.

00:16:15,449 --> 00:16:18,188
The Omni enables you
  to walk...

00:16:18,188 --> 00:16:20,626
run...

00:16:20,626 --> 00:16:21,896
jump...

00:16:21,896 --> 00:16:25,202
and crouch
  in 360 degrees,

00:16:25,202 --> 00:16:27,707
and put your mind and your body
  into the video game

00:16:27,707 --> 00:16:29,945
to transport you
  into a different world.

00:16:33,921 --> 00:16:35,690
[ gunfire, explosions ]

00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,552
Cuban: Cool.
  John: Wow.

00:16:49,552 --> 00:16:50,855
Virtual reality
  has never broken through

00:16:50,855 --> 00:16:52,592
because the technology
  wasn't ready.

00:16:52,592 --> 00:16:54,329
That's
  all changing now.

00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:56,801
The technology is here,
  the Omni is here,

00:16:56,801 --> 00:16:59,740
so which of you sharks
  want to be on the forefront

00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,077
of this
  virtual-reality revolution?

00:17:01,077 --> 00:17:02,746
Robert, you look excited.
  Would you like to try it out?

00:17:02,746 --> 00:17:04,183
I'd love to try it out.
  Absolutely.

00:17:04,183 --> 00:17:07,089
Whose glasses
  are you using?

00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:08,993
Goetelvk: This is
  the Oculus Rift.

00:17:08,993 --> 00:17:10,295
Okay, so you're
  using Oculus Rift, right.

00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:11,732
Oculus Rift --
  You can interface

00:17:11,732 --> 00:17:14,771
with the different types
  of video platforms.
  That's right.

00:17:14,771 --> 00:17:16,708
Whoa!
  [ Laughter ]

00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,278
Goetelvk: Be careful, Buddy.
  Be careful when you get in.

00:17:18,278 --> 00:17:19,247
You better give Robert
  a vomit bag.

00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:20,516
[ laughter ]

00:17:20,516 --> 00:17:21,853
All right.
  Now, I'm gonna set up
  the kinect.

00:17:21,853 --> 00:17:23,690
What's it like
  in there, Robert?

00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:24,792
It's very cool.

00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:26,396
So, Robert,
  the gun is just a trigger,

00:17:26,396 --> 00:17:27,531
so you aim
  where your look.

00:17:27,531 --> 00:17:29,201
And there's a --
  Oh, very cool.

00:17:29,201 --> 00:17:30,971
[ gunshots ]
  Oh, wow!

00:17:30,971 --> 00:17:33,844
Oh, Gee!
  Cuban:
  Run, gerbil, run.

00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,249
Look,
  he's back in Croatia!

00:17:36,249 --> 00:17:39,556
[ Laughter ]
  Kevin, come out and play.
  Kevin!

00:17:39,556 --> 00:17:42,328
[ Laughter ]

00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:44,299
Corcoran: All right.
  Oh, what a relief. My God.
  It's very cool.

00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:46,670
Feels very, very immersive.
  How much is it?

00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,741
Goetelvk:
  We're selling those on our
  website right now for $499.

00:17:48,741 --> 00:17:50,645
That's it?
  Mm-hmm.

00:17:50,645 --> 00:17:52,248
That's cheaper
  than I would've thought.

00:17:52,248 --> 00:17:53,518
How many
  have you sold?

00:17:53,518 --> 00:17:55,389
So, we launched this product
  on kickstarter in June.

00:17:55,389 --> 00:17:56,491
What did you raise?

00:17:56,491 --> 00:17:59,964
We raised $1.1 million.
  Wow.

00:17:59,964 --> 00:18:02,369
How many units
  are you gonna have to deliver?
  Close to 3,000.

00:18:02,369 --> 00:18:04,842
Thank you very much, Jan.
  That was awesome.
  Great.

00:18:04,842 --> 00:18:07,346
It was very cool.
  Very, very cool.

00:18:07,346 --> 00:18:08,683
Wait till you see
  how uncool you looked up there.

00:18:08,683 --> 00:18:09,752
John: Were you winded
  when you were on there?

00:18:09,752 --> 00:18:11,589
Herjavec:
  I was, but I don't know

00:18:11,589 --> 00:18:13,593
if I was winded because I didn't
  know how to use it.

00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,230
I think once you got used to it,
  you'd be fine.

00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,667
John: Do you think that guys
  who play games like this

00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:19,104
want to exercise?

00:18:19,104 --> 00:18:21,610
'cause usually they have a
  side job as a plus-Sized model,

00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,747
most guys who are --
  Who play games.
  [ laughter ]

00:18:23,747 --> 00:18:25,451
Yeah. Well, nobody likes
  being overweight.

00:18:25,451 --> 00:18:28,824
People would like to
  be fit, but gamers, they
  don't like to exercise.

00:18:28,824 --> 00:18:31,463
Now we can play games
  and lose weight and Burn
  calories at the same time.

00:18:31,463 --> 00:18:33,433
People are excited
  about this.
  Corcoran: Is that the way
  you're positioning it --

00:18:33,433 --> 00:18:35,137
as a weight-loss machine,
  as well?

00:18:35,137 --> 00:18:36,339
Is that
  what you're thinking?
  A-a-Absolutely.

00:18:36,339 --> 00:18:38,711
But there's
  a bigger issue, right?

00:18:38,711 --> 00:18:41,551
This is pretty much based
  around Oculus Rift, right?

00:18:41,551 --> 00:18:43,922
As Oculus Rift goes,
  you guys go.

00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:45,392
Can you tell me what that is,
  Oculus Rift?

00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:46,561
That's the headset.

00:18:46,561 --> 00:18:47,864
The rift
  is basically what started

00:18:47,864 --> 00:18:49,667
this virtual-reality
  revolution.

00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:52,039
Cuban: They've done a phenomenal
  job of allowing you

00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:54,511
to put on a headset
  and be in an immersive world.

00:18:54,511 --> 00:18:56,448
Is that included
  in the price?

00:18:56,448 --> 00:18:57,917
It's not included
  in the price.
  Herjavec: Oh, it's not?

00:18:57,917 --> 00:18:59,120
Corcoran: So what do you pay
  for that headset?

00:18:59,120 --> 00:18:59,821
John: No, really?
  $300.

00:18:59,821 --> 00:19:01,091
Is the gun included?

00:19:01,091 --> 00:19:03,662
The gun is off-The-Shelf.
  You can buy it online.

00:19:03,662 --> 00:19:06,435
It sounds like it's gonna be
  an $800-To-$900 cost,

00:19:06,435 --> 00:19:07,705
which is quite a bit.

00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:11,646
Why don't you tell us why
  you're worth $20 million today?

00:19:11,646 --> 00:19:13,950
Goetelvk: Mm-hmm.
  'cause, I mean,
  no one's addressed that.

00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,187
Herjavec:
  Yeah, I want to hear that.

00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:16,456
I think it's
  the elephant in the room.
  Mm-hmm.

00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:17,625
That's a ridiculous valuation
  for this.

00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:18,728
Let me walk you
  through the numbers.

00:19:18,728 --> 00:19:20,665
The rift is an analog
  for our product.

00:19:20,665 --> 00:19:22,535
Same target market,
  same people.

00:19:22,535 --> 00:19:25,308
They're selling 200 of these
  per day right now.

00:19:25,308 --> 00:19:28,781
They project to do 500,000 units
  in sales next year.

00:19:28,781 --> 00:19:31,821
If we convert 1 out of 20 buyers
  of the rift,

00:19:31,821 --> 00:19:34,059
well, we would be selling
  25,000 units next year,

00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:36,531
which is $12 1/2 million
  in sales.

00:19:36,531 --> 00:19:38,502
Herjavec: There's a fundamental
  difference, though.

00:19:38,502 --> 00:19:39,604
When I buy the head gear,

00:19:39,604 --> 00:19:41,808
I can still sit around
  and lounge.

00:19:41,808 --> 00:19:43,010
You're forcing me to stand,

00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,847
and you're forcing me
  to be interactive.

00:19:44,847 --> 00:19:47,053
I don't think people
  want to be that interactive.

00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:48,522
I sold 3,000 units
  just without a product yet.

00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:50,092
O'Leary: Jan, staying
  on the numbers for a minute,

00:19:50,092 --> 00:19:51,394
we can debate the merits
  of the product.

00:19:51,394 --> 00:19:53,065
I'm just trying to look
  at the sheer number.

00:19:53,065 --> 00:19:55,236
You want me to pay your value
  two years from now today.

00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:57,507
Corcoran:
  Here's my thinking on it.

00:19:57,507 --> 00:19:59,378
If my husband
  brought this into my house,

00:19:59,378 --> 00:20:00,915
I would divorce him immediately.

00:20:00,915 --> 00:20:04,321
[ laughs ]
  I think it's a problem
  because of its size in the home.

00:20:04,321 --> 00:20:06,893
I also think it's a tremendous
  problem to sell this in retail.

00:20:06,893 --> 00:20:09,399
I sell a lot of product now
  through retail.

00:20:09,399 --> 00:20:11,870
I couldn't get anybody
  to give the floor space to this.

00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:14,075
You'd pay so much
  just to demonstrate it.

00:20:14,075 --> 00:20:15,177
But I think
  that's a concern.

00:20:15,177 --> 00:20:16,279
You have to realize

00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:17,850
that 50% of the population
  is married,

00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,287
and they're gonna have to deal
  with their wife on this one.

00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:22,025
So I'm out.

00:20:23,795 --> 00:20:25,097
John:
  You know, I see the market.

00:20:25,097 --> 00:20:27,169
You know,
  "Black Ops" Did amazing.

00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:28,705
"Grand Theft Auto," right?
  Breaking records.

00:20:28,705 --> 00:20:31,544
I-I see the market, but I also
  don't see somebody playing this

00:20:31,544 --> 00:20:33,783
more than an hour
  or a half an hour a day

00:20:33,783 --> 00:20:35,787
before they can't even play
  it anymore 'cause they're out
  of breath or they're tired.

00:20:35,787 --> 00:20:37,356
They just won't revisit it.

00:20:37,356 --> 00:20:39,961
So for all those reasons
  and more, I'm out.

00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:45,206
Look, great product.
  I will definitely buy one.

00:20:45,206 --> 00:20:46,976
But I think I'm an anomaly.

00:20:46,976 --> 00:20:49,347
You'd better talk to your wife.
  She's not a pushover.

00:20:49,347 --> 00:20:51,686
Well, we have a big house,
  Barbara. She'll never see it.

00:20:51,686 --> 00:20:55,194
But I don't think that people
  want to exercise

00:20:55,194 --> 00:20:58,033
and immerse themselves in
  a physical world to that degree.

00:20:58,033 --> 00:21:00,939
I think if people really wanted
  to immerse themselves that way,

00:21:00,939 --> 00:21:02,041
I think they'll go outside.

00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:04,546
I-I don't buy the premise.
  I'm out.

00:21:04,546 --> 00:21:06,417
O'Leary: I see
  where you're going with it,

00:21:06,417 --> 00:21:09,088
but it is a subsegment
  of a subsegment market,

00:21:09,088 --> 00:21:10,191
and it's very expensive.

00:21:10,191 --> 00:21:12,629
I look at it and say to myself,

00:21:12,629 --> 00:21:14,399
"is this a good deal
  at $20 million

00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:15,368
where you are right now?"

00:21:15,368 --> 00:21:17,405
and the answer is
  No, it's not.

00:21:17,405 --> 00:21:18,609
There's too much risk

00:21:18,609 --> 00:21:20,913
between your delivery
  of a consumer product,

00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:23,919
a retail-Distribution strategy,
  and your sales.

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,656
You've got tons of risk --
  All kinds of risk.

00:21:25,656 --> 00:21:27,693
And I got to pay
  Tomorrow's price today.

00:21:27,693 --> 00:21:28,863
I hate deals like that.

00:21:28,863 --> 00:21:30,666
I hate it
  when you make me pay

00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,505
for two years from now
  if everything works today.

00:21:33,505 --> 00:21:34,742
Why would I do that?

00:21:34,742 --> 00:21:36,779
I'm not an idiot.
  Why would I do that?

00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:37,848
Because of the potential.

00:21:37,848 --> 00:21:39,518
O'Leary:
  You are going to have problems.

00:21:39,518 --> 00:21:41,455
Poo-Poo's gonna happen,
  my friend,

00:21:41,455 --> 00:21:43,259
and I have to pay
  for that now?

00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:47,000
No. It's an outrage.
  Ridiculous. I'm out.

00:21:49,739 --> 00:21:51,610
I get what you're doing.

00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,182
I could see you creating
  $20 million in sales,

00:21:54,182 --> 00:21:57,422
$25 million in sales with this,

00:21:57,422 --> 00:22:00,428
but you're competing just like
  headsets are gonna be competing,

00:22:00,428 --> 00:22:02,766
just like the consoles
  are gonna be competing.

00:22:02,766 --> 00:22:06,206
You're one more -- one
  more outlet competing
  for consumer dollars.

00:22:06,206 --> 00:22:09,012
You have to push that ball
  so hard to keep going.

00:22:09,012 --> 00:22:10,315
You haven't told me

00:22:10,315 --> 00:22:12,286
that there's a way
  to get to $50 million in sales.

00:22:12,286 --> 00:22:13,722
And in six years,
  there's gonna be

00:22:13,722 --> 00:22:16,060
completely new technology
  that blows all this away.

00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,897
For those reasons,
  I'm out.

00:22:21,204 --> 00:22:22,440
Goetelvk: Thank you.
  Thanks, guys.

00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,278
O'Leary: Jan, you know,
  I look at the experience,

00:22:24,278 --> 00:22:26,382
and what can people learn
  from what happened here today?

00:22:26,382 --> 00:22:27,952
And, for me,
  the lesson is,

00:22:27,952 --> 00:22:30,556
very interesting I.P. --
  way overpriced.

00:22:30,556 --> 00:22:33,095
If you had put this
  at a $5 million valuation,

00:22:33,095 --> 00:22:35,033
it would've been
  very interesting.

00:22:35,033 --> 00:22:36,168
Good luck.

00:22:36,168 --> 00:22:38,774
Thank you.
  Herjavec:
  Good luck, Jan.

00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,212
Anybody that pays $20 million
  for that is insane.

00:22:41,212 --> 00:22:43,617
Gamers are lazy,
  like most human beings.

00:22:43,617 --> 00:22:44,887
They don't want to exercise.

00:22:44,887 --> 00:22:46,122
No, they don't.

00:22:53,971 --> 00:22:56,978
Narrator:
  Next into the tank are two moms
  from Bayonne, New Jersey,

00:22:56,978 --> 00:23:00,953
with a cooler way
  to keep kids safe.

00:23:00,953 --> 00:23:03,391
Herjavec:
  [ laughs ]

00:23:05,963 --> 00:23:07,065
Cuban: Cool.

00:23:07,065 --> 00:23:09,337
Cute kids.
  Very cool.

00:23:09,337 --> 00:23:11,675
Hi, sharks.
  My name is Jocelyn Fine.

00:23:11,675 --> 00:23:13,212
And I'm
  Kelly Dineen.

00:23:13,212 --> 00:23:14,815
We're
  from New Jersey,

00:23:14,815 --> 00:23:18,088
and we are the founders
  and moms behind Fohawx!

00:23:18,088 --> 00:23:21,629
We're here today
  seeking $150,000

00:23:21,629 --> 00:23:23,666
in exchange
  for 30% of our business.

00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:26,940
Sharks, just about
  every parent can relate

00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,510
to the struggle
  that you face

00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:31,750
when you try to get your child
  to wear their safety helmet.

00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,054
It's a fight.
  Why?

00:23:34,054 --> 00:23:36,360
Well, safety helmets
  are not perceived as being cool.

00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,466
They're clunky,
  plain, boring.

00:23:39,466 --> 00:23:42,338
So we took
  something ordinary,

00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:45,378
and we've made it
  extraordinary.

00:23:45,378 --> 00:23:47,750
Originally inspired
  by my daughter Maya,

00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:51,424
Fohawx! Are decorative, funky
  foam helmet accessories

00:23:51,424 --> 00:23:53,027
that come in a variety

00:23:53,027 --> 00:23:55,867
of outrageous colors
  and styles.

00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:57,904
Each and every Fohawx!

00:23:57,904 --> 00:24:01,612
Comes with its own
  self-adhesive velcro strip

00:24:01,612 --> 00:24:03,248
so it can easily be...

00:24:03,248 --> 00:24:07,290
removed and...
  reattached.

00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:08,759
Will it work
  on Kevin's head?

00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:09,761
[ laughter ]

00:24:09,761 --> 00:24:10,998
so you can remove it

00:24:10,998 --> 00:24:13,603
and reattach it
  to any safety helmet.

00:24:13,603 --> 00:24:15,340
So kids
  can collect them all,

00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,912
or they can swap
  with their friends.

00:24:17,912 --> 00:24:19,482
The Fohawx! Brand
  will continue

00:24:19,482 --> 00:24:22,088
to design and develop
  products

00:24:22,088 --> 00:24:24,559
that get kids excited
  about safety gear

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,701
because with Fohawx!,
  safety has never looked so cool.

00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:30,271
Very cool.
  Together: Thanks, guys.

00:24:30,271 --> 00:24:31,474
Say Bye to the sharks.
  Good job.

00:24:31,474 --> 00:24:33,010
Herjavec:
  Bye, guys. Bye, girls.

00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,145
Cuban: Bye.
  Bye, kids.

00:24:34,145 --> 00:24:35,749
Jocelyn, can we see one?

00:24:35,749 --> 00:24:37,586
Cuban:
  Yeah, could we -- can we?
  Of course.
  Absolutely.

00:24:37,586 --> 00:24:39,089
Well, here's
  some samples.

00:24:39,089 --> 00:24:41,093
Corcoran:
  So what is the age group
  that you're targeting here?

00:24:41,093 --> 00:24:42,396
We are targeting...
  thank you.

00:24:42,396 --> 00:24:44,868
...children between
  the ages of 4 and 10.

00:24:44,868 --> 00:24:46,505
This --
  This whole concept,

00:24:46,505 --> 00:24:49,076
like I said before,
  was inspired by my daughter.

00:24:49,076 --> 00:24:51,248
We were doing
  a family bike ride,

00:24:51,248 --> 00:24:52,985
and my son,
  who was 7 at the time,

00:24:52,985 --> 00:24:54,788
refused to wear
  his bike helmet.

00:24:54,788 --> 00:24:57,260
And my daughter,
  she ran to the garage,

00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,832
got some glue gun
  and some purple tissue paper,

00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,001
and created a mohawk

00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:02,571
right down the center
  of his helmet,

00:25:02,571 --> 00:25:04,408
and his whole
  attitude changed.

00:25:04,408 --> 00:25:07,181
He loved it.
  He thought he looked so cool.

00:25:07,181 --> 00:25:10,788
And I loved it because
  he was wearing his helmet --
  No complaining.

00:25:10,788 --> 00:25:12,424
Jocelyn, there --
  There's a lot of products

00:25:12,424 --> 00:25:13,226
like this out there.

00:25:13,226 --> 00:25:14,696
What's different about --

00:25:14,696 --> 00:25:16,400
Okay, what really differentiates
  us is the versat--

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,571
versatility
  of this project -- Product.
  In what sense?

00:25:18,571 --> 00:25:20,808
The -- the fact is that
  it can attach to any helmet.

00:25:20,808 --> 00:25:23,247
This is something that kids --
  Really excite kids

00:25:23,247 --> 00:25:26,253
because there's
  sort of limitless styles

00:25:26,253 --> 00:25:27,757
that we could come up with.

00:25:27,757 --> 00:25:29,594
We can --
  what do you make it for,
  and what do you sell it for?

00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:32,232
We make it for $5.
  That's packaged and landed.

00:25:32,232 --> 00:25:33,535
A good
  price.
  Oh.

00:25:33,535 --> 00:25:34,804
Yes, and our msrp
  is $19.99.

00:25:34,804 --> 00:25:36,975
And how many have you sold?
  Where have you sold them?

00:25:36,975 --> 00:25:39,147
Since we started selling,
  which was just over a year ago,

00:25:39,147 --> 00:25:40,817
we've sold
  about 5,000 units

00:25:40,817 --> 00:25:43,890
and generated
  $50,000 in sales.
  How?

00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:47,063
Um, we are in over 80
  specialty retail toy stores

00:25:47,063 --> 00:25:48,466
across the United States.

00:25:48,466 --> 00:25:50,370
We are also in test mode

00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,975
with two of the biggest
  mass-market retailers

00:25:52,975 --> 00:25:56,148
in the world --
  Toys "R" Us and Walmart.

00:25:56,148 --> 00:25:58,086
Not in retail --
  Online.

00:25:58,086 --> 00:26:00,491
Not in retail, but as some
  of you probably know,

00:26:00,491 --> 00:26:02,260
the mass-Market retailers

00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,731
like to test your products
  a little bit beforehand.
  Right.

00:26:03,731 --> 00:26:05,234
Online.
  John:
  They're gonna want --

00:26:05,234 --> 00:26:07,038
they're gonna want this thing
  at $9.99, aren't they?

00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:08,875
Well, you know,
  we have had no pushback

00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:10,846
from any of the buyers.

00:26:10,846 --> 00:26:12,983
They have not pushed back
  on the price.
  From walmart, you're saying?

00:26:12,983 --> 00:26:15,889
Walmart has -- has not pushed
  back on the price, which --

00:26:15,889 --> 00:26:18,060
So they're okay
  with a $20 retail price?

00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,098
Exactly.
  I don't think so.
  Yeah, that's
  hard to believe.

00:26:20,098 --> 00:26:21,701
Yeah, there's no --
  is there competition for it?

00:26:21,701 --> 00:26:23,973
Sure, there is.
  You kidding?
  There is no --
  We want to be sold --

00:26:23,973 --> 00:26:25,843
Wait a sec.
  There's tons of competition.
  Kelly, there's
  tons of competition.

00:26:25,843 --> 00:26:27,146
I disagree.

00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,953
If you go into
  any mass-Market retailer

00:26:30,953 --> 00:26:32,457
and walk down
  the helmet aisle,

00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:34,361
there's no
  helmet accessory.

00:26:34,361 --> 00:26:36,865
But, Kelly, if I walk
  into a ski shop on a ski hill,

00:26:36,865 --> 00:26:40,573
there's an entire rack
  of stuff like this.

00:26:40,573 --> 00:26:43,480
Okay.
  Also, a bike shop.

00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,350
O'Leary: There's
  tons of competition.
  But we want to be in every
  mass-market retailer.

00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,786
We're talking about Toys "R" Us,
  Walmart, Target --
  It's -- Yeah.

00:26:46,786 --> 00:26:48,590
Why -- Why are your sales
  so low?

00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:52,431
$50,000, and you've got
  how many stores?

00:26:52,431 --> 00:26:55,070
In -- Low? I don't agree.

00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:58,511
In one year in over 80 specialty
  retailer stores, and we --

00:26:58,511 --> 00:26:59,947
she's feisty.
  Look at her go.
  O'Leary: Yeah, we're --
  We're selling --

00:26:59,947 --> 00:27:03,221
Yeah, but we're selling --
  We're two moms
  from new Jersey.

00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:04,790
Yeah, and I get it, but I'm
  struck. The numbers don't lie.

00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:08,331
You're selling hundreds of
  dollars of them in each store.

00:27:08,331 --> 00:27:10,368
We just started selling
  over a year ago.

00:27:10,368 --> 00:27:12,707
I know, but in a year,
  with 80 stores,

00:27:12,707 --> 00:27:16,080
you've done $625 per store
  in a year.

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,717
They're all
  gonna get delisted.

00:27:17,717 --> 00:27:20,322
There's no way on earth
  a retailer's gonna keep that in

00:27:20,322 --> 00:27:22,660
with such small velocity.

00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,999
That's tiny.
  What's happening?
  Well, we envision --

00:27:24,999 --> 00:27:26,702
We envision expanding
  this assortment to include

00:27:26,702 --> 00:27:28,473
the hottest kids licenses,
  animation characters --

00:27:28,473 --> 00:27:30,042
No, but -- but
  you don't have to expand.

00:27:30,042 --> 00:27:31,345
Cuban: Yeah, you're
  missing his point. Yeah,
  you're missing his point.

00:27:31,345 --> 00:27:32,981
No, no, no. You're not --
  You're not going to expand.

00:27:32,981 --> 00:27:35,086
They're not gonna
  take more product.

00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:37,291
It's not working.
  It's just not working.

00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:39,228
It's only been a year.
  Give them a little break.
  It's a year!

00:27:39,228 --> 00:27:41,198
Fine: Another thing We really
  need to talk about is licensing.

00:27:41,198 --> 00:27:44,506
We think that --
  what? Don't even go there.

00:27:44,506 --> 00:27:46,510
You've sold
  $50,000 worth of this stuff.
  Corcoran: Yeah.

00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,314
No, no. Go there. Tell me
  your idea about licensing.
  Why?

00:27:48,314 --> 00:27:50,818
Because we really see that this
  is -- This is what kids want.

00:27:50,818 --> 00:27:52,288
They asked us
  for this product.

00:27:52,288 --> 00:27:53,624
They don't want it!
  They're not buying it!

00:27:53,624 --> 00:27:55,294
Maybe people
  don't want to buy them.

00:27:55,294 --> 00:27:56,263
Well, that -- We haven't
  had that experience.

00:27:56,263 --> 00:27:57,700
No, just -- That's
  just not possible.

00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,870
Look, you're on fire.
  You're burning.

00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,841
You have to figure out
  what's wrong

00:28:01,841 --> 00:28:03,178
and fix it right away
  before you go to zero.

00:28:03,178 --> 00:28:05,816
Do you think that if this
  was price point at $9.99,

00:28:05,816 --> 00:28:07,286
we would be
  selling more?

00:28:07,286 --> 00:28:08,655
I think so.
  Try anything.
  I think so.
  No.

00:28:08,655 --> 00:28:10,258
You do? Okay.
  Try anything.

00:28:10,258 --> 00:28:11,461
So let's
  make that happen.

00:28:11,461 --> 00:28:12,697
I have to get to China.
  I need your contact.

00:28:12,697 --> 00:28:13,933
Corcoran: Kelly, Kelly, Kelly.
  The only way --

00:28:13,933 --> 00:28:15,370
O'Leary: No, no, no, no.
  Can I get a word in here?

00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:17,307
Have you ever set a price
  at $9.99?
  Excuse me. Excuse me.

00:28:17,307 --> 00:28:18,776
Let's stay on the numbers.
  Excuse me.
  Barbara!

00:28:18,776 --> 00:28:20,346
We were still talking, Barbara.
  You're interrupting.
  Excuse me.

00:28:20,346 --> 00:28:22,017
I can't get a word in here.
  I'm still talking.
  You're interrupting.

00:28:22,017 --> 00:28:24,087
Just pipe down.
  No, I'm not interrupting.
  I want to know one thing.

00:28:24,087 --> 00:28:25,657
I'm getting --
  I'm getting a word in.
  Can I finish my --
  Can I finish my statement?

00:28:25,657 --> 00:28:26,793
You've got a minute.
  Go ahead.

00:28:26,793 --> 00:28:28,930
Have you set it up
  at $9.99 or done --

00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:32,271
Or done flash sales to see
  how people respond at $9.99?

00:28:32,271 --> 00:28:33,673
We did do
  a few partnerships

00:28:33,673 --> 00:28:35,811
with some of
  the hot flash-Sale websites,

00:28:35,811 --> 00:28:37,181
and they did sell out

00:28:37,181 --> 00:28:38,818
and come back
  and ask us for more.
  There's your answer.

00:28:38,818 --> 00:28:40,421
Was that part --
  Go ahead, Barb.
  Excuse me.

00:28:40,421 --> 00:28:41,256
Can I speak a moment?

00:28:41,256 --> 00:28:42,124
Yes.
  Fine: Yes, please.

00:28:42,124 --> 00:28:43,928
Consider the possibility

00:28:43,928 --> 00:28:45,532
that you're blinded

00:28:45,532 --> 00:28:48,404
by your sheer love
  of Making this thing go,

00:28:48,404 --> 00:28:50,008
which is a wonderful trait,

00:28:50,008 --> 00:28:52,814
but not when it negates
  fact that's all around you.

00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:58,325
You've got to face the reality
  that all the signs are saying,

00:28:58,325 --> 00:29:00,128
"It's a problem, it's a problem,
  it's a problem,"

00:29:00,128 --> 00:29:02,233
but you're too blind
  to see it.

00:29:02,233 --> 00:29:04,003
So --
  So what are you
  gonna do, Barbara?

00:29:04,003 --> 00:29:05,473
But I don't --
  I'm out for sure.

00:29:05,473 --> 00:29:07,744
We are absolutely --

00:29:07,744 --> 00:29:11,586
We are absolutely committed
  to making this.

00:29:11,586 --> 00:29:12,588
That's not enough.
  That's -- That's not enough.

00:29:12,588 --> 00:29:13,590
That's not good.
  Yeah, but there's --

00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,092
Everybody who walks
  into the Shark Tank

00:29:15,092 --> 00:29:16,061
is fully committed.

00:29:16,061 --> 00:29:18,333
That's why they're here.
  Okay.

00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:20,137
It takes more than that
  to be successful.

00:29:20,137 --> 00:29:24,846
We are two moms trying
  to create this company.

00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:28,754
We need somebody
  who can talk to China.

00:29:28,754 --> 00:29:32,061
We want expertise in
  global expansion, licensing --

00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:34,533
[ laughs ]
  Oh, lordy.
  O'Leary: Why?

00:29:34,533 --> 00:29:36,838
They're asking for it.
  We've had --
  You haven't even conquered
  New Jersey.

00:29:36,838 --> 00:29:38,007
What are you worried
  about the globe for?

00:29:38,007 --> 00:29:40,812
The market
  wants this now.

00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,248
I hate this product.
  It doesn't sell.
  Fine: It's too soon.
  It's too soon.

00:29:42,248 --> 00:29:43,552
Then don't say --
  Oh, my gosh.

00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:46,023
People are calling me
  all the time, "Can you send --"

00:29:46,023 --> 00:29:48,461
why don't they buy it?
  We've had
  international distributors.

00:29:48,461 --> 00:29:50,165
They are buying it!
  Well, why doesn't it
  show up in the numbers?

00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:52,536
What would you -- What would --
  what would've made you happy?

00:29:52,536 --> 00:29:54,875
If we came in here and we said
  we sold $75,000, $100,000?
  Numbers five times this.

00:29:54,875 --> 00:29:56,010
What are you
  looking for?
  Cuban:
  No, actually, wait. No.

00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:57,046
Here's what would've
  made it happen.

00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:58,181
A million dollars?
  Herjavec: No, no.

00:29:58,181 --> 00:29:59,418
This is what would've
  made us happy.

00:29:59,418 --> 00:30:02,057
If you would've said,
  "We had one store,

00:30:02,057 --> 00:30:04,027
and they sold $50,000 worth,"

00:30:04,027 --> 00:30:06,465
and you would've said,
  "We just need more money

00:30:06,465 --> 00:30:08,169
so we can go to a second store
  and then a third store."

00:30:08,169 --> 00:30:10,774
Then we could project numbers.

00:30:10,774 --> 00:30:14,081
You're selling us on the dream
  and not discussing the green.

00:30:15,317 --> 00:30:17,889
I'm out.

00:30:17,889 --> 00:30:22,365
Kelly, Um, look, you're --
  You're very scattered.

00:30:22,365 --> 00:30:24,302
There's a lot of products
  like it.

00:30:24,302 --> 00:30:25,672
You don't want to acknowledge
  that, but there are.

00:30:25,672 --> 00:30:27,609
And you're not getting
  enough customers.

00:30:27,609 --> 00:30:30,348
We really feel like this is
  the beginning for us.

00:30:30,348 --> 00:30:32,386
I appreciate what you're saying,
  but for us,

00:30:32,386 --> 00:30:33,388
we really are just --

00:30:33,388 --> 00:30:35,058
Our momentum is just
  really starting now.

00:30:35,058 --> 00:30:36,160
I hope so.

00:30:37,229 --> 00:30:37,964
I'm out.

00:30:37,964 --> 00:30:39,734
Okay.

00:30:44,311 --> 00:30:47,216
Daymond,
  let's do this together.

00:30:47,216 --> 00:30:50,691
Let's -- You want
  to sell them at $9.99?

00:30:50,691 --> 00:30:52,327
Let's do it together.

00:30:52,327 --> 00:30:54,397
It's not about the sales
  that we're upset about.

00:30:54,397 --> 00:30:56,201
It's the sales
  and amount of the stores.

00:30:56,201 --> 00:30:58,239
You have to look at that,

00:30:58,239 --> 00:30:59,542
and you have to take
  all this you've learned

00:30:59,542 --> 00:31:00,811
and use it
  moving forward.

00:31:00,811 --> 00:31:03,283
But at this point,
  I can't help you. I'm out.

00:31:08,059 --> 00:31:11,500
Okay,
  thank you.

00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,836
Herjavec:
  Is there anybody left?

00:31:12,836 --> 00:31:14,272
Well, yes, there is.
  Mister --

00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:16,610
[ laughs ]
  Oh, Mr. Wonderful,
  I can't wait to hear this.

00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:18,481
[ laughter ]

00:31:18,481 --> 00:31:20,652
I don't know
  what you're gonna do.

00:31:20,652 --> 00:31:22,188
I really don't know,

00:31:22,188 --> 00:31:23,759
because you're on the path,
  right now, to zero.

00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:26,664
Well, we came here today
  prepared to make a deal,

00:31:26,664 --> 00:31:29,670
and we are still --
  This business
  is not working.

00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,074
There's no numbers
  that make it work.
  It is working.

00:31:31,074 --> 00:31:32,476
I just gave you the math,
  and you deny it.

00:31:32,476 --> 00:31:33,612
What's the matter
  with you?

00:31:33,612 --> 00:31:37,019
Listen -- This is
  the first step of Fohawx!

00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:40,159
There will be a Fohawx!
  For every single kid.

00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,564
There will be a Fohawx!
  With the mavericks.

00:31:42,564 --> 00:31:44,635
There will be a Fohawx!
  With a fubu.

00:31:44,635 --> 00:31:45,938
You can print
  on this.

00:31:45,938 --> 00:31:47,140
There's glitter,
  there's die-cutting.

00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,877
Okay, I can't
  take it anymore.
  It's endless.

00:31:48,877 --> 00:31:51,750
Corcoran: Kelly --
  I want partners
  that can deal in reality.

00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,687
You've got to wake up
  and smell the bankruptcy, okay?

00:31:56,259 --> 00:31:58,297
I'm out.

00:31:58,297 --> 00:31:59,933
All right,
  you're missing out.
  Okay, thank you.

00:31:59,933 --> 00:32:01,169
John: Good luck.
  Good luck, guys.
  Cuban: Good luck, guys.

00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,338
Fine: Okay.
  Thank you.
  Prove us wrong.

00:32:04,844 --> 00:32:06,848
[ sighs ]
  Corcoran: Ugh.

00:32:06,848 --> 00:32:09,720
Exhausting.

00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,495
I truly feel like Fohawx!
  Is my fourth child.

00:32:13,495 --> 00:32:16,167
I have sacrificed
  so much to get here,

00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:18,471
and I'm just
  really disappointed

00:32:18,471 --> 00:32:20,475
that it didn't
  come across

00:32:20,475 --> 00:32:25,051
as being as successful
  as it feels to us.

00:32:25,051 --> 00:32:26,822
They were determined.

00:32:26,822 --> 00:32:28,692
Ferocious,
  I would say.
  Blinded.

00:32:28,692 --> 00:32:30,463
The question was, were they
  determined to make money,

00:32:30,463 --> 00:32:33,536
or were they determined
  to prove themselves right?
  To be right.

00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:46,262
My name is Al "Bubba" Baker,
  and I live in Avon, Ohio,

00:32:46,262 --> 00:32:48,266
with my beautiful wife,
  Sabrina,

00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:50,638
and I have
  three lovely children.

00:32:50,638 --> 00:32:52,676
I played in the NFL
  for 13 years.

00:32:52,676 --> 00:32:55,214
I was rookie of the year.
  I was an all-Pro.

00:32:55,214 --> 00:32:59,222
That was my job then,
  but barbecue is my passion.

00:33:00,993 --> 00:33:03,431
So, how we doing over here?
  Fantastic.

00:33:03,431 --> 00:33:07,105
After my NFL career, I opened up
  my own barbecue restaurant,

00:33:07,105 --> 00:33:08,942
and that's where
  my revolutionary product

00:33:08,942 --> 00:33:10,245
was invented.

00:33:10,245 --> 00:33:13,819
It's convenient, it's delicious,
  and it's all-natural.

00:33:13,819 --> 00:33:15,723
Here you go. You ready?
  Touchdown!

00:33:15,723 --> 00:33:18,161
It's important for us
  to get this investment today,

00:33:18,161 --> 00:33:21,401
because we've spent every penny
  on this dream,

00:33:21,401 --> 00:33:24,675
and we've almost wiped out
  the profits from my restaurant.

00:33:24,675 --> 00:33:26,879
My family's made
  a lot of sacrifices,

00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,549
particularly my wife, Sabrina,

00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:30,587
and I want to be able
  to show her

00:33:30,587 --> 00:33:33,292
that at the end of the day,
  it's gonna pay off.

00:33:33,292 --> 00:33:35,464
Being in the NFL for 13 years,

00:33:35,464 --> 00:33:39,205
things don't always go according
  to your game plan,

00:33:39,205 --> 00:33:42,745
and it's the end result --
  Winning -- that matters.

00:34:02,086 --> 00:34:03,188
Hi.

00:34:03,188 --> 00:34:06,762
I'm al "Bubba" Baker
  from Avon, Ohio,

00:34:06,762 --> 00:34:09,468
owner of the de-boned
  baby back rib steaks.

00:34:09,468 --> 00:34:11,872
I'm seeking $300,000

00:34:11,872 --> 00:34:16,014
in exchange for 15% equity
  in my company,

00:34:16,014 --> 00:34:18,587
and this is
  my lovely daughter Brittani.

00:34:18,587 --> 00:34:20,457
She's gonna make you sharks

00:34:20,457 --> 00:34:24,265
ribs in a microwave
  in two minutes.

00:34:25,701 --> 00:34:29,675
Now, I played a little football
  in the NFL for 13 years.

00:34:29,675 --> 00:34:34,051
That was my job.
  Barbecue is my passion.

00:34:34,051 --> 00:34:36,857
Sadly, I married a woman
  that doesn't like ribs

00:34:36,857 --> 00:34:38,961
because they're too messy.

00:34:38,961 --> 00:34:40,598
So I vowed to find a way

00:34:40,598 --> 00:34:42,669
for my wife
  to be able to enjoy ribs.

00:34:42,669 --> 00:34:45,876
But how do you make ribs
  less messy?

00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:48,447
You take the bones out.
  [ laughs ]

00:34:48,447 --> 00:34:51,388
After 20 years,
  I found the perfect method,

00:34:51,388 --> 00:34:55,129
and the de-boned
  baby back rib steaks were born.

00:34:55,129 --> 00:34:58,937
We are the only people
  that have removed the bones

00:34:58,937 --> 00:35:02,778
from an actual slab of Rib,
  leaving the meat intact

00:35:02,778 --> 00:35:06,151
so that everyone can enjoy ribs
  with a knife and fork.

00:35:06,151 --> 00:35:08,489
Our de-boned baby back rib steak

00:35:08,489 --> 00:35:12,731
is not pieces of meat
  formed in the shape of a rib,

00:35:12,731 --> 00:35:13,968
if you know what I mean.

00:35:13,968 --> 00:35:15,671
[ laughs ]
  you tell them, Bubba.

00:35:15,671 --> 00:35:17,709
Boneless meats are
  the way of the future,

00:35:17,709 --> 00:35:20,748
and the future is now.

00:35:20,748 --> 00:35:23,754
Make no bones about it, sharks.
  It's time for some ribs.

00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:26,260
John: Yeah.
  It's always time
  for ribs.

00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,430
All right, Bubba. Bless me
  with the Bubba baby back.

00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,432
[ laughs ]

00:35:29,432 --> 00:35:31,370
Cuban:
  Bubba, who'd you play for?

00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:32,940
Well, I played for the lions.

00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,877
I was rookie of the year
  in 1978.

00:35:34,877 --> 00:35:38,151
I played for
  the then-St. Louis cardinals,

00:35:38,151 --> 00:35:41,157
and then I came back and
  I retired in Cleveland in 1990.

00:35:41,157 --> 00:35:43,228
That's a long career, man.
  Great career.

00:35:48,305 --> 00:35:50,242
This is
  absolutely delicious.

00:35:50,242 --> 00:35:51,745
Yeah,
  it's very good.

00:35:51,745 --> 00:35:53,683
This is really,
  really Good.
  Thank you. Thank you.

00:35:53,683 --> 00:35:55,988
So, basically -- I just want
  to be really, really clear.

00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:58,326
I buy this, I throw it in the
  microwave for two minutes --

00:35:58,326 --> 00:35:59,528
and it tastes like this?

00:35:59,528 --> 00:36:00,731
You got it.

00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,503
Mmm.

00:36:03,503 --> 00:36:05,808
Often, when we
  go to restaurants,

00:36:05,808 --> 00:36:08,146
cowboy rib eye,
  bone-In rib eye --

00:36:08,146 --> 00:36:09,782
Some people actually believe

00:36:09,782 --> 00:36:11,854
that the bone
  just tastes better.

00:36:11,854 --> 00:36:12,990
That's a great point.

00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:16,129
We cook the product
  with the bone in it,

00:36:16,129 --> 00:36:18,066
and when the product
  is fully cooked,

00:36:18,066 --> 00:36:20,505
then we remove the bones,
  then we quick-chill it,

00:36:20,505 --> 00:36:22,409
and then it's packed
  right away.

00:36:22,409 --> 00:36:23,745
O'Leary:
  Is there anything proprietary

00:36:23,745 --> 00:36:25,315
about how
  you're removing the bone,

00:36:25,315 --> 00:36:26,918
or are you
  genetically altering cows

00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:28,287
So they grow up
  with no ribs?

00:36:28,287 --> 00:36:31,495
[ laughter ]
  actually, it's pigs.
  Kevin, it's hogs.

00:36:31,495 --> 00:36:33,499
Okay, So, why couldn't I
  just do the same thing?

00:36:33,499 --> 00:36:35,603
Well, um...

00:36:35,603 --> 00:36:38,308
if you mind,
  I'm not running, guys.
  The process and the product --

00:36:38,308 --> 00:36:39,912
don't run from
  the tough questions.

00:36:39,912 --> 00:36:41,248
Okay.

00:36:41,248 --> 00:36:43,920
I'm not gonna
  run from any questions.
  Literally.

00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,557
Right here, Kevin,

00:36:45,557 --> 00:36:48,430
is the patent
  for the product,

00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:51,736
and right here is
  the patent for the process.

00:36:51,736 --> 00:36:52,838
Wow.

00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:54,910
Could I see
  the process patent?

00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:56,479
Here. Take them both
  to them.

00:36:56,479 --> 00:36:58,784
So, nobody else Can make
  boneless ribs?

00:36:58,784 --> 00:37:00,053
Let me be more specific.

00:37:00,053 --> 00:37:03,026
No one else can make
  a fully cooked rib

00:37:03,026 --> 00:37:06,900
with either one or more
  bones removed from it.

00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,635
Wow.

00:37:09,072 --> 00:37:10,976
And how do you
  get the bones out?

00:37:10,976 --> 00:37:12,746
If I tell you that,
  I got to kill you.

00:37:12,746 --> 00:37:14,382
Kill him.
  Cuban: No, you don't.
  You got a patent.

00:37:14,382 --> 00:37:15,619
You got a patent
  for it, Bubba.

00:37:15,619 --> 00:37:17,456
You can tell him.
  Yeah, tell me.

00:37:17,456 --> 00:37:19,126
Baker: Robert, honestly,
  there's the patent,

00:37:19,126 --> 00:37:20,796
then there's the know-How,

00:37:20,796 --> 00:37:23,835
and what I say to people
  who are gonna go try

00:37:23,835 --> 00:37:26,374
and reverse-engineer
  and figure out how to do it,

00:37:26,374 --> 00:37:27,878
I say, "Good luck to you,

00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:29,915
'cause it took me
  20 years to do it."

00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,184
O'Leary: I got to
  tell you something.

00:37:31,184 --> 00:37:32,521
In the entire history
  of "Shark Tank,"

00:37:32,521 --> 00:37:36,662
I've never seen a patent
  on a food product ever before.

00:37:36,662 --> 00:37:37,931
Thank you.
  'cause we worked it.

00:37:39,768 --> 00:37:41,539
Herjavec:
  Al, what are your sales

00:37:41,539 --> 00:37:43,176
and how many locations
  are you in?

00:37:43,176 --> 00:37:46,716
Okay, our sales
  are $154,000.

00:37:46,716 --> 00:37:48,019
Over what period?

00:37:48,019 --> 00:37:50,157
Over a year's period.

00:37:50,157 --> 00:37:52,728
We're selling
  in about 48 stores.

00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:55,034
You said it took you
  20 years to develop this,

00:37:55,034 --> 00:37:57,305
and you've only been
  in business one year.

00:37:57,305 --> 00:37:59,710
What happened
  to those other 19 years?

00:38:01,614 --> 00:38:04,687
Well, at one point,
  I'll be honest with you.

00:38:04,687 --> 00:38:08,194
I, um -- I hate to
  use this word -- I quit.

00:38:08,194 --> 00:38:09,496
And the reason
  that this young lady and I

00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:12,169
are partners is
  we had an incident

00:38:12,169 --> 00:38:15,476
where she was in track,
  and, like most dads,

00:38:15,476 --> 00:38:16,678
I was pushing her.

00:38:16,678 --> 00:38:19,684
She said, "Hey,
  I don't want to run track."

00:38:19,684 --> 00:38:21,888
I said, "You cannot quit."

00:38:21,888 --> 00:38:24,461
And she said, "Well, you quit
  on the boneless ribs."

00:38:24,461 --> 00:38:25,529
Oh!
  Corcoran: Powerful.

00:38:25,529 --> 00:38:27,233
Yeah.

00:38:27,233 --> 00:38:28,803
If it wasn't for her,

00:38:28,803 --> 00:38:30,707
I wouldn't still be doing
  what I'm doing.

00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:34,014
O'Leary: Okay, guys.

00:38:34,014 --> 00:38:35,384
I actually am an investor

00:38:35,384 --> 00:38:37,621
in a restaurant chain
  with 450 locations

00:38:37,621 --> 00:38:39,091
that sells
  a ton of protein,

00:38:39,091 --> 00:38:41,596
and this is their second-largest
  selling item -- Ribs.

00:38:41,596 --> 00:38:43,834
Here's the big problem
  with your deal right now.

00:38:43,834 --> 00:38:46,407
You're asking for $2 million
  valuation on this thing.

00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,742
You're not making any money.

00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:50,915
The only value here
  is in the patent.

00:38:50,915 --> 00:38:53,955
This reminds me of a story
  that's so relevant to you.

00:38:53,955 --> 00:38:54,957
I love stories.

00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:56,060
The first season
  of "Shark Tank,"

00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,128
a guy stood
  right where you are.

00:38:57,128 --> 00:38:58,498
He had
  a folding-neck guitar.

00:38:58,498 --> 00:39:00,335
He wanted to build out
  a guitar company.

00:39:00,335 --> 00:39:01,571
The only thing of value

00:39:01,571 --> 00:39:03,442
was the patent
  on the folding-Neck technology.

00:39:03,442 --> 00:39:05,412
You know where
  we are today?
  Where are you at?

00:39:05,412 --> 00:39:07,283
They are licensing
  that technology

00:39:07,283 --> 00:39:09,755
on Fender Bender guitars
  all around the world.

00:39:09,755 --> 00:39:11,124
He's gonna be rich.

00:39:11,124 --> 00:39:12,460
Listen to
  what I'm saying to you.

00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:16,535
A patent on a food product --
  That's interesting.

00:39:16,535 --> 00:39:18,406
And the only value
  in the patent

00:39:18,406 --> 00:39:20,844
is to license it to
  one of the suppliers of protein.

00:39:20,844 --> 00:39:22,714
I want to take you
  to one guy...

00:39:22,714 --> 00:39:23,716
okay.

00:39:23,716 --> 00:39:25,120
...that supplies eight --

00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,025
You know what?
  Pigs hate this guy.
  [ laughs ]

00:39:28,025 --> 00:39:29,963
All around the world,
  pigs are walking around saying,

00:39:29,963 --> 00:39:31,666
"Stop the senseless slaughter,"
  because of this one guy.

00:39:31,666 --> 00:39:34,037
[ laughs ]

00:39:34,037 --> 00:39:37,512
So, my offer is very simple.
  I'll give you the $300,000.

00:39:37,512 --> 00:39:39,149
It's contingent on getting

00:39:39,149 --> 00:39:41,854
one of the large
  meat processors in america

00:39:41,854 --> 00:39:43,323
to license the patent.

00:39:44,058 --> 00:39:46,364
But I want 49%.

00:39:46,364 --> 00:39:47,566
That's the deal.

00:39:59,223 --> 00:40:02,197
Narrator:
  All five sharks are still in.

00:40:02,197 --> 00:40:04,734
Kevin has made an offer
  of $300,000,

00:40:04,734 --> 00:40:08,576
contingent on a licensing deal
  with a large meat processor.

00:40:08,576 --> 00:40:11,716
But he wants
  49% of Al's company.

00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,091
That's the first time
  Kevin actually has a decent idea

00:40:16,091 --> 00:40:17,126
when it comes to
  something like this.

00:40:17,126 --> 00:40:18,296
It's the first time

00:40:18,296 --> 00:40:20,734
we've heard his stupid idea
  making any sense.

00:40:20,734 --> 00:40:22,404
John:
  That idea is so brilliant,

00:40:22,404 --> 00:40:25,645
I'll do the exact same deal,
  but I'll only take 30%.

00:40:26,379 --> 00:40:28,083
Bam, Kevin!

00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:31,323
This greedy savage --
  His deal is horrible.

00:40:31,323 --> 00:40:32,759
O'Leary: He's never done
  a deal like this.

00:40:32,759 --> 00:40:35,031
If you talk to
  the guy that owns --
  I've licensed plenty.

00:40:35,031 --> 00:40:38,070
Al, let me
  clear it up for you.
  Yeah, okay.

00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,707
I think you're paying
  a very expensive price

00:40:39,707 --> 00:40:41,310
for somebody
  to make a phone call for you

00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:43,080
that you could do
  on your own.

00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,249
I'm out.

00:40:46,621 --> 00:40:47,623
Barbara?

00:40:47,623 --> 00:40:48,926
I would have pitched you

00:40:48,926 --> 00:40:50,931
that I should bring you
  to some of the big-box stores,

00:40:50,931 --> 00:40:53,502
some of the club channels,
  like B.J.'s, Costco,

00:40:53,502 --> 00:40:55,974
but I happen to think
  some of the offers on the table

00:40:55,974 --> 00:40:58,713
are better, so I'm out.
  Okay.

00:40:58,713 --> 00:41:00,049
Thank you.
  Cuban: I'm kind of
  in the same boat.

00:41:00,049 --> 00:41:01,686
I think you need to
  fatten up the hog some

00:41:01,686 --> 00:41:02,988
before it's ready to go.

00:41:02,988 --> 00:41:05,226
For me, the business would
  have to be a little bit bigger.

00:41:05,226 --> 00:41:07,765
That's why you're limited
  kind of to the licensing play.

00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:09,168
So, for those reasons,
  I'm out.

00:41:09,168 --> 00:41:10,470
Okay.

00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,675
Herjavec:
  Al, you got two offers.
  Yeah.

00:41:12,675 --> 00:41:14,813
Both licensing deals.

00:41:14,813 --> 00:41:17,017
Al, is this the path
  that you want to go down?

00:41:19,823 --> 00:41:21,828
Talk to the guys
  at Voyage-air and Fender --

00:41:21,828 --> 00:41:22,830
All around the world.

00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:24,132
I'm the man.

00:41:24,132 --> 00:41:25,869
And I want you and I
  to de-bone this pig together.

00:41:25,869 --> 00:41:27,439
[ laughs ]

00:41:29,142 --> 00:41:31,347
You've got the real deal,
  or you've got the
  discount license guy.

00:41:31,347 --> 00:41:33,284
Day 1, you're not
  taking a check,

00:41:33,284 --> 00:41:35,589
and he wants to take
  50% of your company.

00:41:35,589 --> 00:41:37,026
49%.

00:41:37,026 --> 00:41:39,096
I'm worth every cent
  of that 49%.

00:41:41,468 --> 00:41:43,673
What are you gonna do?

00:41:46,645 --> 00:41:51,355
Um, Kevin, I love the fact
  that you have made us an offer,

00:41:51,355 --> 00:41:54,261
but I think I'm gonna
  take Daymond's deal.
  Ah!

00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:55,564
You picked
  the better man, my son.

00:41:55,564 --> 00:41:58,069
You de-boned the pig
  right in front of me!

00:41:58,069 --> 00:42:00,240
Thanks a lot.
  Right deal, al.

00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,810
Thank you.
  Thank you.

Hey, hey!

00:42:06,954 --> 00:42:09,025
He was
  a great salesperson.

00:42:09,025 --> 00:42:10,198
He was a great pitcher.

00:42:10,198 --> 00:42:11,232
Yes, he is.
  He was
  a great salesperson.

00:42:11,232 --> 00:42:12,433
He understood
  the art of pitching.

00:42:12,433 --> 00:42:15,036
And he sure knows
  how to cook a rib.

00:42:15,036 --> 00:42:16,637

  Yay!

00:42:16,637 --> 00:42:18,639
Studying
  Daymond's background,

00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:22,310
I think he's a guy
  that enjoys making change,

00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:24,479
and that's what this is going to
  do to the barbecue industry.

00:42:24,479 --> 00:42:26,047
It's gonna change barbecue
  as we know it.
