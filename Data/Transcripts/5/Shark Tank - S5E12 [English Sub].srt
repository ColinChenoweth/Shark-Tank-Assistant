00:00:02,037 --> 00:00:03,240
Narrator: It's a special
  holiday edition of "Shark Tank."

00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,043
And even with the grinch
  in the tank...

00:00:05,043 --> 00:00:07,248
[ laughter ]
  ...it's jollier than ever.

00:00:07,248 --> 00:00:08,818
This stuff is hideous.

00:00:08,818 --> 00:00:10,922
I hate this idea.

00:00:10,922 --> 00:00:14,696
I can't believe
  I actually agree with Kevin.

00:00:14,696 --> 00:00:16,200
You're dead to me.

00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,969
Daymond.
  You're dead to me, too.

00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:20,275
If you described hell on earth,
  that would be it.

00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,714
Narrator: In the tank,
  hopeful entrepreneurs

00:00:23,714 --> 00:00:26,253
get a once-in-a-Lifetime chance
  to pitch the sharks

00:00:26,253 --> 00:00:28,057
in hopes of
  getting an investment

00:00:28,057 --> 00:00:30,930
to start, grow,
  or save their businesses.

00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:34,102
Our sales were $862,000.
  Whoa.

00:00:34,102 --> 00:00:35,739
Narrator: The entrepreneurs
  must convince a shark

00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:38,010
to invest the full amount
  they're asking for,

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,248
or they'll
  walk away with nothing.

00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,152
He will never get share
  in this market.

00:00:42,152 --> 00:00:43,822
Ever, Ever, ever, ever!

00:00:43,822 --> 00:00:45,391
NARRATOR:
  If the sharks hear a great idea,

00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:48,465
they're ready to invest
  using their own money.

00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:51,170
And now I'm gonna
  take it all off for you.
  Ooh.

00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,740
Narrator: And they're willing
  to fight each other

00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,076
for a piece of the action.

00:00:54,076 --> 00:00:55,813
Don't ever listen to Kevin
  on that stuff. He's the worst.

00:00:55,813 --> 00:00:58,117
So I'm actually shocked scrooge
  has made you guys an offer.

00:00:58,117 --> 00:01:00,356
I almost feel bad about it,
  but not really.

00:01:00,356 --> 00:01:01,491
[ laughs ]

00:01:02,593 --> 00:01:03,695
NARRATOR:
  Who are the sharks?

00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:08,205
They're self-Made millionaire
  and billionaire investors

00:01:08,205 --> 00:01:10,709
who are entrepreneurs
  themselves.

00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:13,382
Kevin O'Leary
  is a venture capitalist

00:01:13,382 --> 00:01:15,285
who turned a $10,000 loan

00:01:15,285 --> 00:01:20,462
into a software business
  worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:20,462 --> 00:01:23,468
Daymond John is
  a fashion and branding expert

00:01:23,468 --> 00:01:25,472
Who grew
  his homemade clothing line

00:01:25,472 --> 00:01:28,211
into the globally recognized
  fashion brand fubu,

00:01:28,211 --> 00:01:32,086
with over $6 billion
  in retail sales to date.

00:01:32,086 --> 00:01:34,825
Robert herjavec, the son
  of an immigrant factory worker,

00:01:34,825 --> 00:01:36,962
is now a technology mogul

00:01:36,962 --> 00:01:42,006
Who sold his first internet
  companies for over $350 million.

00:01:42,006 --> 00:01:44,378
Lori Greiner, the queen of qvc,

00:01:44,378 --> 00:01:48,453
holds over 100 patents and
  has launched over 300 products

00:01:48,453 --> 00:01:51,625
grossing over a half a billion
  dollars in retail sales.

00:01:52,327 --> 00:01:54,398
And Mark Cuban --

00:01:54,398 --> 00:01:56,736
Notorious billionaire
  entrepreneur, tech guru,

00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:08,526
and the outspoken owner
  of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.

00:02:08,526 --> 00:02:09,829
First into the tank

00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:12,200
is an entrepreneur
  from Lubbock, Texas,

00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,973
with a solution to one of
  the holidays' biggest headaches.

00:02:21,753 --> 00:02:24,091
Hi. My name
  is Shawn Genenbacher,

00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:26,061
and my company is Lite-Netics.

00:02:26,061 --> 00:02:31,406
I'm seeking $125,000 in exchange
  for 20% of my business.

00:02:31,406 --> 00:02:34,712
Now, everyone loves the festive
  atmosphere of the holidays.

00:02:34,712 --> 00:02:36,616
All the food, all the family --

00:02:36,616 --> 00:02:38,720
Okay,
  maybe not all the family.

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,889
But the decorations

00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:42,361
and, of course, my favorite,
  the lighting.

00:02:42,361 --> 00:02:44,766
Now, there is just one problem.

00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:47,940
Nothing can ruin
  the holiday spirit quicker

00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,678
than a tangled mess
  of holiday light strands.

00:02:50,678 --> 00:02:53,717
The clips, the tabs,
  the glues, the screws --

00:02:53,717 --> 00:02:56,022
All the tools needed
  to keep these attached.

00:02:56,022 --> 00:02:59,495
Well, you know, it doesn't have
  to be so complicated anymore.

00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:03,036
Introducing Lite-Netics.

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,009
[ chuckles ]
  ah.

00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:08,180
Magnetic light strands.

00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,319
These are the first and only
  light strands featuring a magnet

00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:13,791
embedded at the base
  of each and every socket.

00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:17,098
This allows for the quickest
  and easiest attachment

00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:19,035
of any strands available.

00:03:19,035 --> 00:03:22,276
So a decorating job
  that once took hours to complete

00:03:22,276 --> 00:03:24,546
can now be done in just minutes.

00:03:24,546 --> 00:03:25,548
Let me show you.

00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:37,239
Hmm.

00:03:38,341 --> 00:03:39,410
Voila . Just like that.

00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,180
So now you can spend less time

00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,384
on the roofs
  and off those ladders

00:03:43,384 --> 00:03:45,723
and more time sipping nog
  around the old yule log.

00:03:45,723 --> 00:03:48,796
So how many of you sharks
  are gonna team up with me

00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:50,599
so we can light up this world?

00:03:51,835 --> 00:03:53,605
Does it work
  on aluminum?

00:03:53,605 --> 00:03:55,543
It does not work
  on aluminum.

00:03:55,543 --> 00:03:58,749
How many homes have a metal
  that this would stick to?

00:03:58,749 --> 00:04:00,118
A lot of them do, actually.

00:04:00,118 --> 00:04:01,888
It just depends on the portion
  of the world you're at.

00:04:01,888 --> 00:04:05,930
How many people know if they
  have metal in the Eaves or not?

00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:06,999
Well, I think
  you can see that, can't you?

00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:08,268
Well, I-It's real simple.

00:04:08,268 --> 00:04:10,706
Well, metal or aluminum --
  I mean...

00:04:10,706 --> 00:04:12,710
You know, commercial side --
  This is not just for resident.

00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,214
But the commercial side,
  a lot of these are metal.

00:04:14,214 --> 00:04:17,854
In the residential side,
  you're seeing a-a lot of --

00:04:17,854 --> 00:04:20,326
of metal also,
  just depending on your gutter.

00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:21,929
But let's put that aside
  for a second.

00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,234
Okay.
  Tell me about
  the ones you've sold.

00:04:24,234 --> 00:04:25,603
How have you sold those?

00:04:25,603 --> 00:04:28,008
Well, I focused
  the last couple years

00:04:28,008 --> 00:04:29,879
on targeting
  the professional installers.

00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:33,552
They're out there working
  with your commercial builders,

00:04:33,552 --> 00:04:35,757
commercial installers
  that do this on the side

00:04:35,757 --> 00:04:37,427
during that holiday season.

00:04:37,427 --> 00:04:38,429
For residential?

00:04:38,429 --> 00:04:39,565
For both.
  Oh, interesting.

00:04:39,565 --> 00:04:41,468
So, which retailers
  have picked you up?

00:04:41,468 --> 00:04:43,005
I'm -- I'm working c-Currently
  with some buyers

00:04:43,005 --> 00:04:44,642
for -- for home depot.

00:04:44,642 --> 00:04:46,646
Okay.
  They --
  they like the product.

00:04:46,646 --> 00:04:47,915
They've taken this product now,

00:04:47,915 --> 00:04:49,618
and they're taking it
  to their factories

00:04:49,618 --> 00:04:50,654
So they can get some pricing

00:04:50,654 --> 00:04:52,391
and Costs down
  for the retail market.

00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:55,530
That's the market
  that I'm trying to jump into.
  Oh.

00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:56,599
What are
  the total sales?
  John: Okay, how much --

00:04:56,599 --> 00:04:58,169
Total sales, yes,
  in the last year.

00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:00,674
Last year,
  we did $118,000 in sales.

00:05:00,674 --> 00:05:03,746
We netted $38,000.
  How long have you been
  in business?

00:05:03,746 --> 00:05:05,684
We've been in business the last
  four seasons -- four years.

00:05:05,684 --> 00:05:07,187
So what were your years
  prior to that?

00:05:07,187 --> 00:05:10,360
Little over $400,000
  for the last 4 years.
  And so you're --

00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,131
You're up a little bit,
  but about the same.
  John:
  On average, it's the same.

00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:13,500
But it's about the same.
  You're not scaling it.

00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,504
What I'm having problems with
  is some factories,

00:05:15,504 --> 00:05:17,641
you know, trying to get
  my costs down a little bit.

00:05:17,641 --> 00:05:20,882
When I first started this
  product and got this patent,

00:05:20,882 --> 00:05:22,785
I pursued it, and I-I --
  It's cleared?
  The patent's cleared?

00:05:22,785 --> 00:05:24,789
Yes.
  Wow.

00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:27,127
You have something here,
  my friend.
  Greiner: You know what
  the biggest problem is,

00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:29,966
I think is that magnets
  are actually expensive.
  Yes.

00:05:29,966 --> 00:05:32,572
I've tried myself because
  I've made products with magnets,

00:05:32,572 --> 00:05:36,380
and the problem is, is you just
  can't get the price down

00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,549
after a certain point.

00:05:37,549 --> 00:05:38,951
It --
  because it is
  what it is.

00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:40,488
Right.

00:05:40,488 --> 00:05:42,458
Shawn, I want --
  A 50-Foot Strand

00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:45,665
of traditional lights is --
  Is how much at home depot?

00:05:45,665 --> 00:05:47,235
Maybe $20, $25.

00:05:47,235 --> 00:05:48,604
And how much
  would yours be?

00:05:48,604 --> 00:05:51,643
Probably $70.

00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:52,712
Oh.
  Ooh.

00:05:52,712 --> 00:05:54,349
That's what it is currently.

00:05:54,349 --> 00:05:56,520
Like I said, if we can work
  and get that product down --
  So --

00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,755
Yeah, but, Shawn,
  there's two problems.
  Mm-hmm.

00:05:57,755 --> 00:06:00,294
If you were talking
  about a 20% difference,

00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:02,365
if you were $25
  and they were $20,

00:06:02,365 --> 00:06:05,338
you can get
  the price down.
  But it --

00:06:05,338 --> 00:06:08,577
but are we even in the business
  of equaling their price?
  Absolutely.

00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:10,081
Or is that an impossible road
  to go down?
  I think what we're --

00:06:10,081 --> 00:06:11,316
what you're forgetting
  is -- Is if --

00:06:11,316 --> 00:06:12,753
if you're doing it
  on some of these structures,

00:06:12,753 --> 00:06:15,659
you got to buy
  the additional accessories --

00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:17,529
the -- the clips and the tabs --
  and that's just more.

00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:20,067
But they're plastic,
  so they're very cheap.

00:06:20,067 --> 00:06:23,341
What is wrong with approaching
  one of the major players...
  that's a $50 difference.

00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,044
...and saying,
  "I own this patent,

00:06:25,044 --> 00:06:29,287
"and I have a cost disadvantage
  of my small scale.

00:06:29,287 --> 00:06:31,157
I would like
  to show you this solution"?

00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,526
because it's patented.

00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:33,995
You're not -- You don't have the
  risk of them ripping you off.

00:06:33,995 --> 00:06:36,467
Absolutely. I-I would --
  Why wouldn't you do that?

00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:38,138
That opportunity
  hasn't arised yet

00:06:38,138 --> 00:06:39,807
where I had someone come in
  and --

00:06:39,807 --> 00:06:41,577
And, you know,
  offer license agreement.

00:06:41,577 --> 00:06:44,150
But you --
  but have you called them?
  No, I-I have not.

00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,922
Well, this is one of these deals
  where -- Where I can --

00:06:46,922 --> 00:06:49,761
I feel -- I almost feel bad
  about it, but not really.

00:06:49,761 --> 00:06:52,166
Ha!
  I mean,
  you want an offer?

00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,234
Here's what it is.

00:06:53,234 --> 00:06:55,572
I know how
  to call the two players

00:06:55,572 --> 00:06:57,877
that globally own
  this market, okay?

00:06:57,877 --> 00:07:01,919
I'll negotiate the deal
  with them.

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,591
You have the right to override
  me if you don't like the terms,

00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,731
but I won't pay you the $125,000
  till we sign it.

00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:10,135
Because I'm gonna get
  a massive advance on it.

00:07:10,135 --> 00:07:12,407
But we're 50/50 partners.

00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,915
Any other offers?

00:07:18,017 --> 00:07:20,656
Let me --
  Let me clear the deck, Shawn.

00:07:20,656 --> 00:07:22,560
I think you have
  a massive problem.

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,865
At a $50
  price difference --

00:07:24,865 --> 00:07:29,207
I-I don't know if there is
  a residential market for this.

00:07:29,207 --> 00:07:30,944
So I'm not sure
  that's the right path.

00:07:30,944 --> 00:07:32,781
And I got to tell you,
  after four years,

00:07:32,781 --> 00:07:34,484
you might be learning
  the same thing.

00:07:34,484 --> 00:07:35,553
I'm out.

00:07:35,553 --> 00:07:37,725
Okay.

00:07:40,798 --> 00:07:42,066
Anyone else?

00:07:42,066 --> 00:07:45,039
Look, the one issue
  to every professional installer

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,475
that's important to them

00:07:46,475 --> 00:07:49,281
and is their biggest cost
  is their time.

00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:53,390
To be able to say, "Your time
  is worth $50 or $100 an hour.

00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,195
"I can save you
  two hours per install.

00:07:56,195 --> 00:07:58,667
This is the product
  for you."

00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:00,637
Then you don't have
  to fight the behemoths,

00:08:00,637 --> 00:08:02,374
but I would focus
  on the professional installers.

00:08:02,374 --> 00:08:03,910
I don't know how
  to reach that market,

00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,282
and for that reason,
  I'm out.

00:08:06,282 --> 00:08:07,785
Thank you.

00:08:07,785 --> 00:08:09,388
Good advice,
  but no check.

00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:11,960
Greiner: You have
  three problems, as I see it.

00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,398
Number one
  is the cost is too high,

00:08:14,398 --> 00:08:17,004
and I don't think you'll be able
  to manufacture it

00:08:17,004 --> 00:08:19,810
ever apples to apples to
  the lights that are out there.

00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:22,314
Number two, I don't know
  how many places it'll work.

00:08:22,314 --> 00:08:25,120
Because you have to have metal
  that works with the magnet,

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,857
and a lot of homes
  have aluminum.

00:08:26,857 --> 00:08:30,899
And number three is
  you also have something here --

00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:32,434
This is a large bulb.

00:08:32,434 --> 00:08:34,873
It's more -- I think they call
  it the old-Fashioned light bulb.

00:08:34,873 --> 00:08:36,777
Yeah,
  it's a c9 socket. Mm-hmm.
  Yes.

00:08:36,777 --> 00:08:38,113
And a lot of people today

00:08:38,113 --> 00:08:40,284
are buying icicle lights
  for the home

00:08:40,284 --> 00:08:42,154
and smaller bulbs
  for the home.

00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:45,127
I don't think it's going to work
  in the retail market.

00:08:45,127 --> 00:08:46,095
I'm out.

00:08:46,095 --> 00:08:48,099
Thank you.

00:08:48,099 --> 00:08:49,269
Daymond?

00:08:54,011 --> 00:08:56,483
I believe that the only
  opportunity is the licenses.

00:08:58,521 --> 00:09:00,692
I'll go head-to-head
  with him,

00:09:00,692 --> 00:09:03,331
and I'll offer you
  the exact same deal,

00:09:03,331 --> 00:09:07,005
but instead of 50%,
  I'll only take 40%.

00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,140
Interesting.

00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,509
Why do I have to provide

00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:11,580
all the creativity
  to these deals?

00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,421
Doesn't anybody have the ability
  to think on their own here?

00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:16,791
This is ridiculous.

00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,127
It's a challenge here.
  Greiner:
  You should be flattered.

00:09:18,127 --> 00:09:20,465
I do this for a living.
  I'll give you an example.

00:09:20,465 --> 00:09:21,968
It's the voyage-Air guitar guy

00:09:21,968 --> 00:09:24,707
who didn't pick up the phone
  and call Fender or Gibson.

00:09:24,707 --> 00:09:26,210
He had a fantastic technology.

00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,747
I picked up the phone.

00:09:27,747 --> 00:09:29,717
Now he's in Fender guitar.

00:09:29,717 --> 00:09:32,088
And so I'm worth
  the extra 10%.
  Well, he has
  one of those examples.

00:09:32,088 --> 00:09:34,460
I have four.
  I do the work.
  That's the difference.

00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,364
I do the work as well.
  You get -- You get
  Mr. Wonderful.

00:09:36,364 --> 00:09:38,802
I'm worth 10% more.
  That's the way I look at it.
  [ laughs ]

00:09:38,802 --> 00:09:41,374
the Deal's gonna take me
  nine months to do.

00:09:41,374 --> 00:09:43,612
I want you to know that
  it's gonna take a long time.
  That's right.
  It's gonna take me two.

00:09:43,612 --> 00:09:45,616
So we need to do the deal.
  It won't happen that fast.

00:09:45,616 --> 00:09:47,286
They will want to test it.

00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:48,990
They will want
  to check their costs.

00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,292
And you'll be negotiating
  the whole way through.

00:09:50,292 --> 00:09:52,163
Herjavec: But, Shawn, you got
  to make a decision

00:09:52,163 --> 00:09:53,900
because Christmas
  is gonna come and go.

00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,536
We need a decision.
  We need a decision.

00:09:55,536 --> 00:09:59,712
Well, I appreciate
  both of them.

00:09:59,712 --> 00:10:03,720
Would you be willing
  to go to 30%, Daymond?

00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,024
Greiner: Ooh.

00:10:06,024 --> 00:10:08,095
He didn't ask you.

00:10:08,095 --> 00:10:09,430
No.

00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,967
I'm hard on the 40%.

00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:15,109
Shawn, I have no flexibility
  in case you're thinking.

00:10:15,109 --> 00:10:17,246
But I'll negotiate a better deal
  than he'll get.

00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:22,657
I'm gonna have to decline.

00:10:22,657 --> 00:10:24,561
Both offers?

00:10:24,561 --> 00:10:25,563
Yes.

00:10:25,563 --> 00:10:26,332
Wow.

00:10:27,734 --> 00:10:29,972
You see
  a different path?

00:10:29,972 --> 00:10:32,844
Yes. I'll continue on
  with the way I've been working.

00:10:32,844 --> 00:10:34,314
I-I got some opportunities

00:10:34,314 --> 00:10:37,087
with some -- Some other big
  wholesalers and distributors.

00:10:37,087 --> 00:10:38,556
Good luck.
  All right.

00:10:38,556 --> 00:10:39,658
Good luck.
  Thank you.

00:10:39,658 --> 00:10:40,961
Shawn, you're dead to me.

00:10:40,961 --> 00:10:42,531
[ laughs ] Best thing that
  happened to you all day, Shawn.

00:10:42,531 --> 00:10:43,533
Yeah.

00:10:43,533 --> 00:10:44,969
John: Shawn...

00:10:44,969 --> 00:10:46,071
you're dead to me, too.

00:10:46,071 --> 00:10:47,274
[ laughter ]
  Cuban: Second-Best thing.

00:10:47,274 --> 00:10:49,144
Good luck.

00:10:49,144 --> 00:10:52,585
So, Mr. Grinch
  and the little happy elf

00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:53,921
couldn't get a deal today.

00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:56,091
We did our worst,
  and that's all that counts.

00:10:56,091 --> 00:10:58,664
He will never get share
  in this market.

00:10:58,664 --> 00:11:00,266
Ever, Ever, ever, ever!

00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:02,405
Genebacher:
  I needed a strategic partner.

00:11:02,405 --> 00:11:04,241
I-I just think the equity,
  what they wanted,

00:11:04,241 --> 00:11:05,711
was just too much for me,

00:11:05,711 --> 00:11:08,483
and I just wasn't prepared and
  ready to -- to -- to give up.

00:11:19,806 --> 00:11:21,176
My name is Morri Chowaiki.

00:11:21,176 --> 00:11:22,913
I live in San Diego, California,

00:11:22,913 --> 00:11:24,282
with my wife and three kids.

00:11:24,282 --> 00:11:25,651
1, 2, 3. Oh!

00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:28,390
The holiday season
  in Our house is fantastic.

00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:32,231
It's full of love, presents,
  tons of good food, and laughter.

00:11:32,231 --> 00:11:34,369
Happy Christmas!
  Happy Hanukkah!

00:11:34,369 --> 00:11:37,341
Looks great,
  but maybe a little -- No.

00:11:37,341 --> 00:11:38,845
Not on your life.

00:11:38,845 --> 00:11:40,582
Chowaiki:
  My wife celebrates Christmas.

00:11:40,582 --> 00:11:42,285
And I celebrate Hanukkah.
  Children: Yay!

00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:45,224
My product is a solution
  for the thousands and thousands

00:11:45,224 --> 00:11:47,996
of interfaith families
  that live in the United States,

00:11:47,996 --> 00:11:49,265
and it bridges the gap

00:11:49,265 --> 00:11:51,637
between "Ho, ho, ho"
  And "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel."

00:11:51,637 --> 00:11:53,374
Come on, guys.
  Get our orders out.

00:11:53,374 --> 00:11:55,512
I have been selling my product
  now for three years.

00:11:55,512 --> 00:11:57,649
I've already put a second
  mortgage out on our house

00:11:57,649 --> 00:11:58,952
to make this dream come True.

00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:00,422
We can't keep putting money

00:12:00,422 --> 00:12:01,958
into this business ourselves.

00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,361
Without an investment
  from the sharks,

00:12:03,361 --> 00:12:04,763
I fear that we just
  won't make it.

00:12:04,763 --> 00:12:06,033
Oh!
  Daddy!

00:12:06,033 --> 00:12:07,903
This product
  is important to me

00:12:07,903 --> 00:12:10,342
because it brought us together
  as a family.

00:12:10,342 --> 00:12:13,147
And to be able to provide
  that same gift

00:12:13,147 --> 00:12:15,719
to the millions of interfaith
  families that are out there

00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:18,391
would just be a wonderful
  achievement in life for me.

00:12:26,207 --> 00:12:27,442
[ chuckles ]

00:12:27,442 --> 00:12:28,645
[ Chuckles ]

00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:33,889
Hello, gefilte sharks.

00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:35,826
And how are you?
  [ laughs ]

00:12:35,826 --> 00:12:37,296
My name is Morri Chowaiki,

00:12:37,296 --> 00:12:39,367
and I'm from san Diego,
  California.

00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:41,438
My company is one life products,

00:12:41,438 --> 00:12:43,308
and I'm here seeking $50,000

00:12:43,308 --> 00:12:45,980
in exchange
  for 15% of my company.

00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,285
Sharks, chrismukkah...
  [ laughter ]

00:12:48,285 --> 00:12:51,091
...is the most wonderful time
  of the year,

00:12:51,091 --> 00:12:56,268
a time when Interfaith families
  Can play spin the dreidel

00:12:56,268 --> 00:12:58,772
while kissing
  under the mistletoe.

00:12:58,772 --> 00:13:00,609
Wouldn't it be wonderful

00:13:00,609 --> 00:13:02,815
if interfaith families
  could find a way

00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:05,219
to truly capture the spirit
  of chrismukkah?

00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:06,789
Well, mazel toe.

00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:09,695
Because now they can
  with the Hanukkah tree topper.

00:13:09,695 --> 00:13:14,170
It's the perfect pairing between
  all these holiday traditions,

00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,110
and, hey, doesn't it look great
  on top of a Christmas tree?

00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:20,750
No more debates between
  Candy canes or chocolate gelt

00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,823
or Santa versus Hanukkah Harry.

00:13:23,823 --> 00:13:26,128
[ laughs ]
  You get
  the best of both worlds

00:13:26,128 --> 00:13:28,266
with the Hanukkah tree topper.

00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:31,272
[ laughter ]
  together, I know we can take
  the Hanukkah tree topper

00:13:31,272 --> 00:13:34,879
to the next level and make
  lots of shekels doing it.

00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:36,582
So what do you say?

00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:39,555
This holiday,
  let's reach for the star

00:13:39,555 --> 00:13:41,893
and sell like meshuggener!

00:13:41,893 --> 00:13:44,698
[ laughter ]

00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:47,872
So, I-I want to make sure
  we understand this right.

00:13:47,872 --> 00:13:51,512
Is the product simply the star
  to put on top of the tree?

00:13:51,512 --> 00:13:53,516
Yes, it is.
  Can we see them,
  morri?

00:13:53,516 --> 00:13:55,187
Absolutely.
  Who would like to see them?

00:13:55,187 --> 00:13:56,289
Greiner: Here.
  Cuban: We'd all like
  to see them.

00:13:56,289 --> 00:13:57,224
O'Leary: We all would.
  All right. Fantastic.

00:13:57,224 --> 00:13:58,694
Cuban: Yeah.
  Oh!

00:13:58,694 --> 00:14:00,998
Down Goes morri!
  Down I go. Down I go.

00:14:00,998 --> 00:14:02,936
There you go.
  And there is --

00:14:02,936 --> 00:14:04,205
You can turn on
  the switch on that.
  So -- So one lights up,
  and one doesn't.

00:14:04,205 --> 00:14:05,273
One does not.

00:14:05,273 --> 00:14:06,843
Oh, there it is.
  Exactly.

00:14:06,843 --> 00:14:08,581
How many of these
  have you sold?

00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:12,655
I have sold approximately 12,000
  of that item right there.

00:14:12,655 --> 00:14:14,426
Of this one.
  Herjavec: Where are you
  selling them, morri?

00:14:14,426 --> 00:14:18,099
Currently we are selling
  in a big-Box retail store

00:14:18,099 --> 00:14:21,139
as well as online
  and in a-a flight magazine.

00:14:21,139 --> 00:14:22,609
What do you
  sell them for?

00:14:22,609 --> 00:14:25,214
Sell those for $19.99.
  They cost $2.

00:14:25,214 --> 00:14:27,252
So we have
  about a 70% wholesale Margin

00:14:27,252 --> 00:14:28,887
and 90% retail margin.

00:14:28,887 --> 00:14:31,059
Those are higher end.

00:14:31,059 --> 00:14:35,301
We're at about $35.99
  and about, right now, a $9 cost

00:14:35,301 --> 00:14:37,840
because it's our first run, and
  we expect costs to come down.

00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,246
How much have you made
  on your 12,000 units?
  Our gross sales
  have been $150,000.

00:14:41,246 --> 00:14:42,215
In the last 12 months.

00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,585
No.

00:14:43,585 --> 00:14:45,589
In the last three seasons.

00:14:47,325 --> 00:14:48,394
Whoa.

00:14:50,499 --> 00:14:51,968
This year --

00:14:51,968 --> 00:14:53,270
Morri, baby,
  that's not a lot of sales.

00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,573
Oh, well --
  Bubele, come on!

00:14:54,573 --> 00:14:56,511
You got to step up
  your game.
  Wait a minute.

00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,481
Just wait a minute.
  Morri, oy vey!
  Come on!

00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,352
Let me tell you something.
  Let me tell you something.

00:15:00,352 --> 00:15:02,356
We've got massive potential,
  and let me tell you why, okay?

00:15:02,356 --> 00:15:04,527
[ laughter ]
  first of all --

00:15:04,527 --> 00:15:06,431
I love when the answer
  to existing sales is potential.

00:15:06,431 --> 00:15:08,234
Oh, no. This is --
  This is real potential.

00:15:08,234 --> 00:15:09,470
Or could it be, morri,

00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,209
that there's a little
  market confusion going on here?

00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:14,547
Nope.
  But, morri,
  sales are poo-Poo.

00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:17,619
So, here are the stats.

00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:19,523
A national survey was done

00:15:19,523 --> 00:15:21,594
that said that nearly 50%

00:15:21,594 --> 00:15:23,933
of all jewish people
  in the United States

00:15:23,933 --> 00:15:25,602
have married somebody
  of another faith.

00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:29,009
So we feel
  that there is a target audience

00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:30,580
of probably somewhere
  in the neighborhood

00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,316
of a million to a million
  and a half households

00:15:32,316 --> 00:15:33,953
for this one item.

00:15:33,953 --> 00:15:35,623
The retailer that we're in,

00:15:35,623 --> 00:15:38,128
we're in about 200 --
  Almost 200 stores.

00:15:38,128 --> 00:15:39,765
Herjavec:
  Which retailer is it?
  Bed bath &amp; beyond.

00:15:39,765 --> 00:15:42,404
Is that the only retailer
  you're in?

00:15:42,404 --> 00:15:43,539
In brick and mortar, yes.

00:15:43,539 --> 00:15:45,343
What percent of sales
  are online,

00:15:45,343 --> 00:15:47,447
and what are in retail?

00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:51,522
I'd say 70% online,
  20% in-Flight magazine,

00:15:51,522 --> 00:15:53,859
and the rest with stores.

00:15:53,859 --> 00:15:55,329
Morri, what are you gonna
  use the money for?

00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,567
Number one --
  New product design.

00:15:57,567 --> 00:15:59,905
We want to get our own website
  up and running

00:15:59,905 --> 00:16:02,343
so that we're not relying
  on Sites and Commissions

00:16:02,343 --> 00:16:03,612
and things like that.

00:16:03,612 --> 00:16:05,249
I need some fulfillment space,

00:16:05,249 --> 00:16:07,353
because we started
  not being able to park
  one car in the garage.

00:16:07,353 --> 00:16:08,857
Now it's two cars in the garage,
  and my wife --

00:16:08,857 --> 00:16:11,428
You're doing this all
  from home?
  Everything. 100%.

00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,832
How much money
  have you put in?

00:16:12,832 --> 00:16:16,004
About close to $130,000
  of our own money.

00:16:16,004 --> 00:16:17,407
Wow.

00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,777
O'Leary: Morri, one of
  the challenges about this,

00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:20,681
it's
  a seasonal business.

00:16:20,681 --> 00:16:23,987
I hate seasonality because,
  you know, you have one shot.

00:16:23,987 --> 00:16:25,189
You either make
  too much or make too little.

00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:27,260
It's always the same problem
  every year.

00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,601
That's never gonna change
  with --
  Mr. Wonderful, I was waiting
  for you bring that up.

00:16:30,601 --> 00:16:32,070
And what's your answer?

00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,540
My answer is, number one, first
  and foremost, you're right.

00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,775
It is seasonal.

00:16:34,775 --> 00:16:37,581
But number two --
  You're making the deal with me,

00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:39,252
and I work
  12 months out of the year.

00:16:39,252 --> 00:16:41,122
Morri,
  there's another problem.

00:16:41,122 --> 00:16:44,662
When a family buys this,
  it's once.
  Mm-hmm.

00:16:44,662 --> 00:16:46,132
They don't need to buy it again.

00:16:46,132 --> 00:16:48,503
Subset of a subset
  of a subset market,

00:16:48,503 --> 00:16:51,576
seasonal purchase,
  one-time-In-Your-Life only.

00:16:51,576 --> 00:16:53,814
If you described hell on earth,
  that would be it.

00:16:53,814 --> 00:16:54,749
[ chuckles ]

00:16:54,749 --> 00:16:55,752
No, I think --

00:16:55,752 --> 00:16:57,722
I'm sorry.
  I have to disagree.

00:16:57,722 --> 00:16:59,927
In my heart, I know
  we got something special

00:16:59,927 --> 00:17:02,331
and that is -- and it's -- and
  it may be a niche, but it's --

00:17:02,331 --> 00:17:03,734
but it's small.

00:17:03,734 --> 00:17:05,370
Well, let me tell you what
  small is. Okay. So I've got --

00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:06,840
I know what small is --
  your sales.

00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,211
Thank you. Well...
  Hey, that's -- That's --

00:17:09,211 --> 00:17:10,615
Numbers don't lie,
  my friend.

00:17:10,615 --> 00:17:11,717
Well, let me explain
  what's coming.

00:17:11,717 --> 00:17:13,854
I've been invited into

00:17:13,854 --> 00:17:16,660
the largest mass-Market
  big-Box store,

00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,231
one of the two
  largest drugstore chains,

00:17:19,231 --> 00:17:21,670
the largest toy-Store chain,

00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:24,710
as well as one of the largest
  discount-Clothing chains.

00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,716
"Invited" means to show it
  or you have a purchase order?

00:17:27,716 --> 00:17:29,853
"Invited" means to show it.

00:17:31,992 --> 00:17:34,763
My friend, morri,
  I'm out.

00:17:38,604 --> 00:17:40,541
I understand.

00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:44,383
You know, I can't believe
  I'm going to say this,

00:17:44,383 --> 00:17:46,955
but...

00:17:46,955 --> 00:17:49,894
I actually agree
  with Kevin.

00:17:49,894 --> 00:17:52,933
And I don't think
  you have a big enough market

00:17:52,933 --> 00:17:55,104
for this to become
  something really scalable

00:17:55,104 --> 00:17:56,708
and a huge business
  for you.

00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,346
Mm-hmm.
  And so for that reason,
  I'm out.

00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:01,351
Lori,
  I'll be honest with you.

00:18:01,351 --> 00:18:03,422
I want
  to do business with you.

00:18:03,422 --> 00:18:05,559
And --
  Morri, she's out.

00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:07,128
I'm out.
  All right.

00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:08,298
Let me tell you this.

00:18:08,298 --> 00:18:10,269
You're working
  in a full-Time job,

00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:12,673
and you're working
  basically out of your garage.

00:18:12,673 --> 00:18:14,544
The biggest challenge
  that I've ever experienced

00:18:14,544 --> 00:18:16,881
with all my "Shark Tank"
  Companies

00:18:16,881 --> 00:18:18,752
has been getting
  out of the garage

00:18:18,752 --> 00:18:20,923
and getting into an office
  or whatever it may be,

00:18:20,923 --> 00:18:23,361
and growing out
  of that home-Based business.
  Which is what I want.

00:18:23,361 --> 00:18:26,301
I don't expect you
  to run my business.

00:18:26,301 --> 00:18:29,808
What I want is your expertise
  behind, you know,

00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:32,546
marketing, social search-Engine
  Optimization.

00:18:32,546 --> 00:18:35,653
Look, it's what you want,
  but you're not set up

00:18:35,653 --> 00:18:38,291
to do that right now,
  so for that reason, I'm out.

00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,630
Okay.

00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:44,203
I think you've done
  a good job here.

00:18:44,203 --> 00:18:46,509
But 3 years later,
  you're at $60,000.

00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:48,346
But I haven't even broke
  Brick and mortar yet.

00:18:48,346 --> 00:18:50,683
For that reason,
  I'm out.

00:18:50,683 --> 00:18:53,188
Okay.

00:18:57,798 --> 00:18:59,134
Daymond.

00:19:01,405 --> 00:19:05,213
You know, I-I did a deal
  with, uh, a rabbi.

00:19:05,213 --> 00:19:08,419
Sure you did.
  Rabbi -- Rabbi Moshe.

00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:10,056
Moshe. Um...

00:19:10,056 --> 00:19:11,158
[ Laughs ]

00:19:11,158 --> 00:19:12,829
Soundbender.
  Yeah.

00:19:12,829 --> 00:19:15,333
Are you gonna
  make an offer on this?

00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,504
Uh...

00:19:19,174 --> 00:19:21,045
there's no way
  this is going to be

00:19:21,045 --> 00:19:22,849
a multi-million-dollar
  business ever.

00:19:22,849 --> 00:19:23,884
No.

00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:38,513
Narrator:
  Four sharks are out.

00:19:38,513 --> 00:19:41,519
Daymond is morri's last chance
  at getting a deal.

00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:45,828
Are you gonna
  make an offer on this?
  Uh...

00:19:47,131 --> 00:19:48,467
there's no way
  this is going to be

00:19:48,467 --> 00:19:51,907
a multi-million-dollar
  business ever.
  No.

00:19:51,907 --> 00:19:53,310
I don't want scrooge

00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,846
to interrupt my, uh,
  thought process here.

00:19:54,846 --> 00:19:56,416
[ laughs ]

00:19:57,652 --> 00:19:59,489
Yeah, Christmas and Hanukkah
  are about faith, and I --

00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,126
I just question your judgment.
  That's all.

00:20:01,126 --> 00:20:02,662
I like --
  There's product extension.

00:20:02,662 --> 00:20:04,399
If he has that,
  he may have some other stuff.

00:20:04,399 --> 00:20:06,636
You know what? I-I think I want
  to take a Gamble on you.

00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:14,620
Uh, $50,000 for 35%
  is my offer.

00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,757
35%.

00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,030
Wow.

00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,536
Morri, why are you even
  thinking about that?

00:20:25,074 --> 00:20:27,479
I'm not looking
  for control.

00:20:27,479 --> 00:20:29,483
Okay.
  I'm just looking
  for a happy chrikkahmas.

00:20:38,534 --> 00:20:40,472
35%.

00:20:43,578 --> 00:20:47,820
Can I ask, is it e-Commerce
  that you can bring?

00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,325
Is it ret--
  I mean, w-What --
  GREINER: Morri. Morri.

00:20:50,325 --> 00:20:52,930
You don't want to have
  an "Oh, no" Moment.

00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,504
This is
  a licensing play.
  Okay.

00:20:56,504 --> 00:21:00,646
And this is to do bulbs
  and Socks and other things,

00:21:00,646 --> 00:21:03,384
as well
  as the primary product.

00:21:09,531 --> 00:21:11,267
You know, morri,
  do me a favor.

00:21:11,267 --> 00:21:13,906
Just -- hopefully You'll make
  the right decision

00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:16,143
and not counter
  and do something crazy,

00:21:16,143 --> 00:21:17,747
because I really want
  to do the deal.

00:21:25,162 --> 00:21:27,033
And your answer is,
  morri?

00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:31,007
My answer is...

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,449
...kiss me.

00:21:35,449 --> 00:21:38,222

00:21:38,222 --> 00:21:39,792
All right.
  All right!

00:21:39,792 --> 00:21:41,963
Ah.
  This is for you.

00:21:41,963 --> 00:21:43,565
Thank you so much.
  Thank you.

00:21:43,565 --> 00:21:45,971
Thank you.

00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,240
Do a little dance.
  All right!

00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,977
Daymond, you look
  like a cute elf.

00:21:48,977 --> 00:21:51,047

  [ laughter ]

00:21:51,047 --> 00:21:52,083

WOMAN: Hi, honey.
  How are you?

00:21:55,857 --> 00:21:57,694
We made a deal.

00:21:57,694 --> 00:21:58,897
You made a deal?

00:21:58,897 --> 00:21:59,965
We made a deal.

00:21:59,965 --> 00:22:00,967
Chowaiki:
  It's a dream come True.

00:22:00,967 --> 00:22:02,771
This is a winning
  lottery ticket.

00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:03,773
This is unbelievable.

00:22:03,773 --> 00:22:05,644
Honey,
  we're so proud of you.

00:22:05,644 --> 00:22:07,079
Okay. Aww!
  Hi, babies!

DAUGHTER:
  Daddy, I miss you!

00:22:08,616 --> 00:22:09,852
Love you!

00:22:09,852 --> 00:22:12,291
To me,
  this is showing my kids

00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:15,030
how important it is
  not to give up.

00:22:20,207 --> 00:22:21,944
Narrator:
  Last season, Marine rob Dyer

00:22:21,944 --> 00:22:24,682
pitched his energy drink
  ruckpack to the sharks.

00:22:24,682 --> 00:22:27,421
Dyer: It's the world's first
  Peak performance nutrition shot,

00:22:27,421 --> 00:22:29,826
designed and tested
  by Spec ops forces.

00:22:29,826 --> 00:22:33,066
$150,000 from the two of us
  for 20%.

00:22:33,066 --> 00:22:34,736
I'll take $150,000
  for 20%.

00:22:34,736 --> 00:22:36,138
Cuban: All right.
  Congratulations, guys.

00:22:36,138 --> 00:22:37,942
Narrator: Let's see
  how rob is doing now.

00:22:40,815 --> 00:22:42,652
Dyer:
  Business has really taken off

00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,289
since making a deal
  with Kevin and Robert.

00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:45,625
Before we came on the show,

00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:48,162
we had done $35,000 revenue
  the entire year.

00:22:48,162 --> 00:22:50,368
10 months later, we're coming up

00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,070
on half a million dollars
  in revenue.

00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,409
We're even sponsoring
  our very own ruckpack jet.

00:22:58,617 --> 00:22:59,853
What do you think?

00:22:59,853 --> 00:23:00,855
Unbelievable.

00:23:00,855 --> 00:23:02,893
You weren't kidding.
  It's the real thing.

00:23:02,893 --> 00:23:05,064
The ruckpack jet's gonna be seen
  by millions of people.

00:23:05,064 --> 00:23:08,137
It's the number-One piece
  at ever air show Across America.

00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,740
So what's happening
  with the walgreen order?

00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,476
We're gonna roll
  right into the entire chain.

00:23:11,476 --> 00:23:12,880
So almost 9,000 stores.

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,382
Okay.
  That's a big deal.

00:23:14,382 --> 00:23:16,019
Dyer: We just signed a deal
  with walgreens,

00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:19,660
and they're gonna be putting us
  in over 8,600 stores nationally.

00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,131
This means a $4 million deal
  for ruckpack,

00:23:22,131 --> 00:23:24,570
and we're only gonna continue
  to grow from there.

00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,472
Well, let's fire
  this thing up.

00:23:27,843 --> 00:23:29,279
Whoa!

00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:30,382
Wow!

00:23:32,653 --> 00:23:34,089
Yeah!

00:23:34,089 --> 00:23:36,461
DYER: Kevin and Robert
  have been amazing for ruckpack.

00:23:36,461 --> 00:23:39,233
Their help has gone way Beyond
  just their checkbook.
  Herjavec: Whoo!

00:23:39,233 --> 00:23:41,002
They help us out
  any time we need,

00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,606
And you can tell
  that they really care

00:23:42,606 --> 00:23:45,545
about the company
  and about the team.
  Oh, wow.

00:23:45,545 --> 00:23:47,082
We're gonna be
  an actual contender

00:23:47,082 --> 00:23:48,318
in the energy-Drink category,

00:23:48,318 --> 00:23:49,820
which is unheard of
  for a new guy,

00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,192
all because of the help that
  I've received from the Sharks.

00:23:52,192 --> 00:23:53,495
Unbelievable.
  That's awesome.

00:23:53,495 --> 00:23:56,033
Unbelievable.

00:24:02,479 --> 00:24:04,951
Narrator: Next into the tank
  are a model and hair stylist

00:24:04,951 --> 00:24:09,026
from Beverly hills with a way
  to enhance a woman's beauty.

00:24:14,438 --> 00:24:16,608
Hi. I'm Rachel.

00:24:16,608 --> 00:24:17,811
And I'm Melissa.

00:24:17,811 --> 00:24:21,083
And we are the cashmere
  hair girls of Beverly Hills.

00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:26,093
We are asking $45,000
  for a 15% stake of our company.

00:24:26,093 --> 00:24:28,966
Every woman has had
  to fake it a time or two,

00:24:28,966 --> 00:24:31,271
especially
  when it comes to beauty.

00:24:31,271 --> 00:24:34,110
Not everyone is born
  with amazing hair.

00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,883
But with hair extensions,
  women can enhance their hair

00:24:36,883 --> 00:24:39,989
into the hair
  that they've always dreamed of.

00:24:39,989 --> 00:24:42,828
As a professional hair Stylist
  and extension expert

00:24:42,828 --> 00:24:45,533
in Beverly hills, I know
  clip-In hair extensions

00:24:45,533 --> 00:24:48,205
are a great
  nonpermanent option.

00:24:48,205 --> 00:24:50,543
Sharks,
  this is a real deal,

00:24:50,543 --> 00:24:52,915
and there is
  nothing fake about it.

00:24:52,915 --> 00:24:55,286
And now I'm gonna
  take it all off for you.

00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:56,890
As you can see,

00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:59,829
I'm going to unclip my hair
  from my head.

00:24:59,829 --> 00:25:01,799
Herjavec: Oh, wow.

00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:05,274
So you can see they are
  tracks attached to clips.
  Wow.

00:25:05,274 --> 00:25:06,643
Can't tell
  the difference.

00:25:06,643 --> 00:25:10,817
And I have two clips on each
  side of my head like that.

00:25:10,817 --> 00:25:12,821
And then three
  that go along the back.

00:25:12,821 --> 00:25:15,260
Here's the first one
  that goes along the back.

00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,398
You have a whole shetland pony
  in your hair, huh?

00:25:17,398 --> 00:25:18,700
It's all coming off.

00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,070
It is all coming off.
  Greiner:
  A shetland pony.

00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:25,814
As you can see, again,
  it is a big difference.

00:25:25,814 --> 00:25:28,119
So it comes
  with the clips in it?
  Yep.

00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:30,959
And I'm gonna show you
  how easy it is to clip back in.

00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:32,896
Is it real human hair?
  It is.

00:25:32,896 --> 00:25:35,067
Melissa: It is 100%
  all indian hair.
  Cuban: Can we see it?

00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:37,471
So there's people in India
  getting their hair cut,

00:25:37,471 --> 00:25:38,941
and they're
  sending you their hair.

00:25:38,941 --> 00:25:41,045
Melissa: We work
  through a manufacturer,

00:25:41,045 --> 00:25:43,584
and they're actually doing
  all the Supplying.

00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:46,022
Weird.
  They actually go out and collect
  the hair, put it together.

00:25:46,022 --> 00:25:48,361
There -- There's
  actually hair auctioners.

00:25:48,361 --> 00:25:51,165
Come on.
  And they collect different
  qualities of hair and suppliers.

00:25:51,165 --> 00:25:53,437
But --
  There's
  really low-Grade hair,

00:25:53,437 --> 00:25:55,508
and you could go up
  to very high quality.

00:25:55,508 --> 00:25:58,581
So that -- my next question is,
  how much is it per extension?

00:25:58,581 --> 00:26:01,654
The cost for us on average
  is $105.

00:26:01,654 --> 00:26:03,724
We retail these
  for $399.

00:26:03,724 --> 00:26:06,965
How many pieces
  do you get for $399?

00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:10,338
You get a full set of cashmere
  hair that is seven tracks.

00:26:10,338 --> 00:26:11,941
How do you know with certainty
  it's human hair?

00:26:11,941 --> 00:26:13,477
How -- I mean --
  [ laughs ]

00:26:13,477 --> 00:26:15,081
Well, no,
  but I'm -- I'm serious.

00:26:15,081 --> 00:26:17,419
No, no, no. Really.
  This is -- This is True.

00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:19,156
You know, listen, it might be
  from the underbelly of a yak.

00:26:19,156 --> 00:26:21,093
We have tested out
  about 20 suppliers,

00:26:21,093 --> 00:26:23,364
so we'll get their hair
  over to us as samples.

00:26:23,364 --> 00:26:24,667
For each batch?
  Yes.

00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:26,738
All cuticle intact,
  it's called Remy.

00:26:26,738 --> 00:26:28,742
We deal with the manufacturer
  and supplier

00:26:28,742 --> 00:26:30,946
that only deals
  with Remy hair.

00:26:30,946 --> 00:26:33,652
In this calendar year, how much
  of this are you going to sell?

00:26:33,652 --> 00:26:36,357
We have been in business
  for six months,

00:26:36,357 --> 00:26:39,464
and we have sold
  a total of $38,000.

00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:42,068
But other people can buy
  from that same supplier.

00:26:42,068 --> 00:26:43,271
Yes.
  Correct?

00:26:43,271 --> 00:26:44,941
That's a possibility.

00:26:44,941 --> 00:26:45,743
Anybody can.
  Right.

00:26:45,743 --> 00:26:47,113
I have 10 years

00:26:47,113 --> 00:26:49,851
as a professional hair stylist
  as an extension expert.

00:26:49,851 --> 00:26:52,923
So I know what girls are looking
  for and what they want.

00:26:52,923 --> 00:26:54,694
I've been a model
  for the last 10 years,

00:26:54,694 --> 00:26:56,598
and I've been
  wearing hair extensions myself

00:26:56,598 --> 00:26:57,600
for a really long time.

00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,938
I used to have
  to make my own.

00:26:59,938 --> 00:27:03,178
I would actually take apart
  other ones from other companies

00:27:03,178 --> 00:27:04,614
and sew them together

00:27:04,614 --> 00:27:07,153
so that they were full enough
  and thick enough and --

00:27:07,153 --> 00:27:08,689
There's nothing worse.
  Nothing.

00:27:08,689 --> 00:27:11,528
There isn't.
  It takes a long time,
  and also I didn't want

00:27:11,528 --> 00:27:14,568
to have to wear
  a ton of metal clips on my head.

00:27:14,568 --> 00:27:16,337
Let me ask you a question.

00:27:16,337 --> 00:27:19,343
Does it concern you --
  Let's talk "Guy meets girl."
  Mm-hmm.

00:27:19,343 --> 00:27:21,448
Guy looks at girl...
  [ Laughs ]

00:27:21,448 --> 00:27:23,653
I don't even want to know
  where this is gonna go.
  ...says,
  "I really like this girl.

00:27:23,653 --> 00:27:26,057
She has spectacular hair.
  Fantastic."

00:27:26,057 --> 00:27:28,796
The next morning...
  a couple of dates go by,
  the special evening arrives,

00:27:28,796 --> 00:27:31,502
and then you find out
  it's just all false advertising.

00:27:31,502 --> 00:27:35,743
Well, isn't that with a lot
  of things women do, you know?
  I mean, do we have
  a problem with this?

00:27:35,743 --> 00:27:38,015
A little bit --
  We cheat a little bit.

00:27:38,015 --> 00:27:39,451
Why not enhance something

00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:41,789
when someone could go
  from an 8 to a 10?

00:27:41,789 --> 00:27:44,394
Taking a pretty girl
  and even making her prettier.
  [ laughs ]

00:27:44,394 --> 00:27:46,365
HERJAVEC: So you've sold me
  it's a great product, okay?

00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:49,371
$38,000 in sales in 6 months --
  Great start.

00:27:49,371 --> 00:27:53,947
Yep.
  How do you now get all the women
  to know all about it?

00:27:53,947 --> 00:27:57,655
Number one is we really want
  to make instructional videos

00:27:57,655 --> 00:27:59,491
that are going
  to basically

00:27:59,491 --> 00:28:01,963
help sell the product
  for us because --

00:28:01,963 --> 00:28:03,266
Sell it where, though?

00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:04,802
Online, uh...
  online. Oh, let me --

00:28:04,802 --> 00:28:07,007
Okay, but, Rachel,
  how are people gonna know

00:28:07,007 --> 00:28:09,846
you're out there to come to
  your website to watch the video?

00:28:09,846 --> 00:28:13,185
Because we make our own beauty
  blogs, we utilize instagram.

00:28:13,185 --> 00:28:16,960
We -- Social media has take--
  A huge help for us.

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,463
We know what works,
  and we're --
  right,
  b-But the challenge --

00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:19,899
And where Robert was trying
  to get to --

00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:22,204
The challenge isn't will
  you have a successful
  business, right?

00:28:22,204 --> 00:28:23,874
Absolutely.
  You guys are there,
  right?

00:28:23,874 --> 00:28:25,811
You've just got to
  keep on doing --
  What are you
  talking about, mark?

00:28:25,811 --> 00:28:26,913
They've got $38,000
  in sales.

00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:28,150
No, no, no.
  They know what they're doing.

00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:29,519
Exactly. 'cause every business
  has to start somewhere.

00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:32,558
And we're actually -- We're
  planning on going into salons,

00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:33,760
and we want to have
  cashmere hair parties.

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,199
We want to be able
  to bring the hair to you.

00:28:36,199 --> 00:28:37,601
You haven't had one yet,
  have you?

00:28:37,601 --> 00:28:39,339
No, but we are having one
  at the end of the month.

00:28:39,339 --> 00:28:41,443
The challenge is,
  can you grow that enough

00:28:41,443 --> 00:28:44,215
to become a company that creates
  a return for an investor?

00:28:44,215 --> 00:28:47,088
Your --
  You asked for $45,000.
  Correct.

00:28:47,088 --> 00:28:48,390
And the reality is,

00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,795
if you guys
  hustle and grind enough...
  mm-hmm.

00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:53,534
...you can generate that
  $45,000, given your margins,

00:28:53,534 --> 00:28:55,505
with just $90,000
  in sales or less.

00:28:55,505 --> 00:28:57,709
And so while I think
  this is a great business,

00:28:57,709 --> 00:28:59,480
I don't think
  this is a great business

00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,951
suited for an investor,
  and so for that reason, I'm out.

00:29:01,951 --> 00:29:03,421
Oh. Okay.

00:29:03,421 --> 00:29:05,291
I think we could grow
  a lot faster, though,

00:29:05,291 --> 00:29:06,961
if we actually
  do have an investment.

00:29:06,961 --> 00:29:08,364
So,
  here's a question.

00:29:08,364 --> 00:29:09,933
When you look
  at yours --

00:29:09,933 --> 00:29:12,339
'cause there's tons
  of extensions out there.

00:29:12,339 --> 00:29:16,547
Where do your prices compare
  to what's already out there?

00:29:16,547 --> 00:29:18,852
Our price is more expensive

00:29:18,852 --> 00:29:22,592
than almost all of the
  other clip-In hair
  extension companies.

00:29:22,592 --> 00:29:24,764
But there's
  a good reason for it.

00:29:24,764 --> 00:29:28,204
A lot of clip-In hair extensions
  sell for half of our price.

00:29:28,204 --> 00:29:30,676
And it's because
  the quality is not good.

00:29:30,676 --> 00:29:34,517
You cannot buy that kind of hair
  for that cheap.

00:29:34,517 --> 00:29:37,523
You have -- You've gone
  to the high end, or at
  least you claim that.

00:29:37,523 --> 00:29:40,361
You're telling me it's not
  yak hair. I'm gonna believe you.

00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,567
But for an investor like me
  to look at this and say,

00:29:42,567 --> 00:29:43,969
"How am I gonna turn this

00:29:43,969 --> 00:29:45,439
into a multi-Million-Dollar
  business?"

00:29:45,439 --> 00:29:46,908
I don't think I am.

00:29:46,908 --> 00:29:48,946
I don't see the strategy
  that gets me there.

00:29:48,946 --> 00:29:52,119
And for that reason...
  I'm out.

00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:53,989
Okay.

00:29:58,098 --> 00:29:59,868
Melissa, are you okay?
  Yeah.

00:29:59,868 --> 00:30:01,171
All right,
  'cause you seem like you're --

00:30:01,171 --> 00:30:04,077
You're frustrated,
  you're melting a little bit.

00:30:04,077 --> 00:30:07,717
I-I guess I stand
  behind this so strongly.
  All right.

00:30:07,717 --> 00:30:11,224
The challenge with this is this
  is purely about marketing.

00:30:11,224 --> 00:30:15,065
And marketing
  is the black hole of a business.

00:30:15,065 --> 00:30:18,338
And, uh...
  well, I think even in the past
  six months, we've been --

00:30:18,338 --> 00:30:20,409
We've done pretty Well ourselves
  getting it out there.
  No, you have. You have.

00:30:20,409 --> 00:30:22,346
And this doesn't mean
  that you guys --

00:30:22,346 --> 00:30:24,050
So if we had help
  from Somebody like you,

00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:26,121
it only would make se--
  You don't want help
  from me on hair.

00:30:26,121 --> 00:30:28,158
[ both laugh ]
  trust me on that one.

00:30:28,158 --> 00:30:29,929
It's a good point.
  I would have to agree
  with mark.

00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:31,566
I don't think
  that this is something

00:30:31,566 --> 00:30:33,235
that you need an investor
  at -- at this time.

00:30:33,235 --> 00:30:34,238
And I'm out.

00:30:34,238 --> 00:30:35,840
Okay. Thank you.

00:30:40,015 --> 00:30:43,890
There's one thing you said here
  today that I think is unique.

00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:47,197
I think
  doing these home parties --

00:30:47,197 --> 00:30:50,437
I think that if you focused
  on that --
  I'm with Lori.

00:30:50,437 --> 00:30:54,278
I like the idea of the hair
  parties at salons and so on.

00:30:54,278 --> 00:30:55,680
But you haven't done it.

00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:59,221
Today,
  for me to invest in it,

00:30:59,221 --> 00:31:02,494
I-I wish there was more
  substance to the strategy.

00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:04,833
That's all.
  Well, I --
  and I'm gonna --

00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:06,870
Look, I wish you the best
  of luck. I'm out.

00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:13,082
Rachel: Lori?
  [ chuckles ]

00:31:13,082 --> 00:31:15,020
we know that you can
  help us a lot.

00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,358
I think that there are
  two products, right?

00:31:17,358 --> 00:31:18,961
Those that are revolutionary,

00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:21,032
and those that are like
  other things out there.

00:31:21,032 --> 00:31:23,203
And when it's like other things
  already out there,

00:31:23,203 --> 00:31:26,610
you have to really try
  much Harder

00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:29,949
to get yourself known
  and to beat the competition.

00:31:29,949 --> 00:31:31,787
I think it's going to be
  really hard for you

00:31:31,787 --> 00:31:33,257
to get ahead
  of that competition.

00:31:33,257 --> 00:31:35,361
So I'm out.

00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:37,365
Thank you.
  Okay, thank you.

00:31:37,365 --> 00:31:39,336
Good luck, you guys.
  Cuban: Good luck, guys.
  You'll be fine.

00:31:39,336 --> 00:31:40,504
It's a very nice product.

00:31:40,504 --> 00:31:41,740
Good luck.
  Good luck, guys.

00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,575
Melissa: Thank you.
  Great hair. Great product.

00:31:42,575 --> 00:31:43,812
Both: Thank you.
  Good luck.

00:31:43,812 --> 00:31:45,448
Greiner: Thank you, guys.
  Good luck.

00:31:45,448 --> 00:31:47,385
Herjavec: Well, she certainly
  believed in it.

00:31:47,385 --> 00:31:48,822
Passionate --
  Very passionate.

00:31:48,822 --> 00:31:50,324
Greiner:
  Very passionate, but --
  they have nothing.

00:31:50,324 --> 00:31:52,395
And I'll tell you what else.

00:31:52,395 --> 00:31:54,232
Where can I find a woman
  with Real hair?

00:31:54,232 --> 00:31:57,706
[ laughter ]

00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:02,683
RACHEL: I think we came here
  wanting a deal

00:32:02,683 --> 00:32:05,187
and wanting everything
  that went along with it.

00:32:05,187 --> 00:32:06,858
It's okay. Take a deep breath.
  Take a deep breath.

00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:08,995
Melissa: It is crushing
  and a disappointment.

00:32:08,995 --> 00:32:10,899
But life goes on.

00:32:16,911 --> 00:32:18,681
Narrator:
  Next into the tank is a duo

00:32:18,681 --> 00:32:20,852
with a new take
  on a favorite Christmas Staple.

00:32:28,869 --> 00:32:31,207
Hi, sharks.
  I'm Evan Mendelsohn.

00:32:31,207 --> 00:32:32,376
And I'm Nick Morton.

00:32:32,376 --> 00:32:34,881
Our company is Tipsy Elves,
  and our slogan is

00:32:34,881 --> 00:32:36,384
"Not your mama's
  Christmas sweater."

00:32:36,384 --> 00:32:38,656
We are seeking
  a $100,000 investment

00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,392
for 5% of our company.

00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:43,131
Before Tipsy Elves,
  Christmas sweaters were old,

00:32:43,131 --> 00:32:44,434
they smelled terrible,

00:32:44,434 --> 00:32:46,538
and you could only find them
  at your local Thrift store.

00:32:46,538 --> 00:32:48,074
Tipsy Elves re-creates

00:32:48,074 --> 00:32:49,945
those Christmas sweaters
  of the past

00:32:49,945 --> 00:32:52,182
with fun, witty, high-Quality
  Christmas sweaters

00:32:52,182 --> 00:32:53,519
that the whole family
  can enjoy.

00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:54,955
And they fit great,
  too.

00:32:54,955 --> 00:32:56,358
But don't take it from us,
  sharks.

00:32:56,358 --> 00:32:57,360
See for yourselves.

00:32:59,397 --> 00:33:02,270
Both: welcome to
  the Tipsy Elves fashion show.

00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,539
John: [ laughs ]

00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:05,476
O'Leary: [ sighs ]

00:33:05,476 --> 00:33:06,778
first we have Greg.

00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:08,917
Greg is wearing
  our runaway sleigh sweater,

00:33:08,917 --> 00:33:11,021
where Santa's sleigh
  gets the best of him.

00:33:11,021 --> 00:33:14,427
He's also wearing our popular
  Christmas bomber Hat.

00:33:14,427 --> 00:33:17,100
Next up, we have adry.

00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,569
She's wearing
  our elf sweater.

00:33:18,569 --> 00:33:22,010
She's also wearing
  our believe Fanny Pack.

00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:23,512
Next, we have Brad.

00:33:23,512 --> 00:33:26,619
Brad is wearing our popular
  Hanukkah Sweater.

00:33:26,619 --> 00:33:28,957
Next up, we have Nikki.

00:33:28,957 --> 00:33:31,194
Nikki is wearing our
  bucktooth Rudolph sweater dress.

00:33:31,194 --> 00:33:32,665
Oh, that's cute.
  Greiner: Yeah.

00:33:32,665 --> 00:33:34,702
Morton: She's also wearing
  our reindeer animal hat.

00:33:34,702 --> 00:33:38,577
Mendelsohn: Last but certainly
  not least, we have Andrew.

00:33:38,577 --> 00:33:40,948
Andrew is wearing our
  reindeer matchmaker jump suit,

00:33:40,948 --> 00:33:42,484
which is brand-New
  this season.

00:33:42,484 --> 00:33:47,161
Zip it up
  and watch them kiss.

00:33:47,161 --> 00:33:48,863
All right, sharks,
  so you've seen

00:33:48,863 --> 00:33:50,200
a little bit
  of what we have to offer.

00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,436
Our beautiful models here

00:33:51,436 --> 00:33:52,771
are gonna be
  handing out a sweater

00:33:52,771 --> 00:33:54,308
to each one of you
  that we've picked out

00:33:54,308 --> 00:33:56,579
along
  with Our bomber hat.

00:33:56,579 --> 00:33:57,748
Herjavec: Thank you.

00:33:57,748 --> 00:33:58,884
Thank you.

00:33:58,884 --> 00:34:00,420
Morton: The idea behind it
  was that there were

00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,924
a bunch of Tipsy Elves
  up in Santa's --

00:34:01,924 --> 00:34:04,261
You know,
  making these sweaters.

00:34:04,261 --> 00:34:05,530
You guys look great.

00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:07,267
Now it's time
  to get down to business.

00:34:07,267 --> 00:34:08,871
This stuff is hideous.

00:34:08,871 --> 00:34:11,777
Why don't you give us
  some sales numbers?

00:34:11,777 --> 00:34:13,714
Mendelsohn:
  We started in 2011.

00:34:13,714 --> 00:34:16,854
2012,
  our sales were $862,000.

00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:20,595
Which gave us $1.35 million
  in Sales in those 2 years.

00:34:20,595 --> 00:34:23,467
Wow.
  A little more than half
  of our orders came from amazon.

00:34:23,467 --> 00:34:26,674
This year, we started
  dabbling in wholesale.

00:34:26,674 --> 00:34:28,978
For example, one major retailer,
  urban outfitters,

00:34:28,978 --> 00:34:30,314
placed an order with us.

00:34:30,314 --> 00:34:32,652
I own the ugliest sweater
  company in history, coogi,

00:34:32,652 --> 00:34:33,888
the ones that bill Cosby
  used to wear.

00:34:33,888 --> 00:34:35,158
Yeah.
  And they're ugly.

00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:36,994
Ugly!
  No, trust me.
  They're really ugly.

00:34:36,994 --> 00:34:40,234
Um, and the challenge we have
  is the returns.

00:34:40,234 --> 00:34:42,839
So how much does
  each one cost to make?

00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:44,576
$12 --
  $11.40 per sweater.

00:34:44,576 --> 00:34:45,846
And what do you
  sell them for?
  And what do you
  sell them for?

00:34:45,846 --> 00:34:46,881
Sell them for $65.

00:34:46,881 --> 00:34:47,883
Oh!
  Wow.

00:34:47,883 --> 00:34:48,985
Wow.

00:34:48,985 --> 00:34:50,521
Greiner:
  What made you say one day,

00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:53,494
"I'm gonna make
  ugly Christmas sweaters"?

00:34:53,494 --> 00:34:54,797
MORTON:
  Evan was a lawyer,

00:34:54,797 --> 00:34:57,268
and it wasn't a job
  that he wanted to pursue.

00:34:57,268 --> 00:34:59,072
I had a background
  in s.E.O.,

00:34:59,072 --> 00:35:01,243
So I started doing
  internet businesses,

00:35:01,243 --> 00:35:03,214
like mostly
  informational websites

00:35:03,214 --> 00:35:05,184
where I'd make money
  off ad revenue.

00:35:05,184 --> 00:35:07,757
I saw there was a high demand
  for Christmas sweaters

00:35:07,757 --> 00:35:08,959
based on search volume.

00:35:08,959 --> 00:35:11,096
Why get into the wholesale
  retail side of it?

00:35:11,096 --> 00:35:12,833
Doesn't that
  just complicate things

00:35:12,833 --> 00:35:14,237
and increase
  your overhead?

00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:17,041
Once you take
  a wholesale account,

00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:18,445
you've got
  to support them,

00:35:18,445 --> 00:35:19,981
you've got to interact
  with them,

00:35:19,981 --> 00:35:21,384
you've got to make
  their buyers happy,

00:35:21,384 --> 00:35:22,787
you've got to talk
  about next season.

00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,757
At our core,
  we're an e-Commerce site.

00:35:24,757 --> 00:35:28,365
Why risk it and go into a
  new area where you're uncertain

00:35:28,365 --> 00:35:29,834
and you've got guys
  like Daymond

00:35:29,834 --> 00:35:32,173
who know this stuff inside
  and out competing with you?

00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:35,212
John: To mark's point,
  when you come over to our side,

00:35:35,212 --> 00:35:37,149
you're gonna have to be able
  to take back inventory,

00:35:37,149 --> 00:35:39,020
you're gonna have to have
  a warehouse the size of,

00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,522
you know, two blocks.

00:35:40,522 --> 00:35:41,959
It's gonna be a lot.
  Sure.

00:35:41,959 --> 00:35:43,629
O'Leary: Everybody's
  echoing the same thing.

00:35:43,629 --> 00:35:46,367
You shouldn't take this
  to retail, in my opinion.

00:35:46,367 --> 00:35:48,840
We're pursuing
  the online strategy

00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,442
as -- As much as we can.

00:35:50,442 --> 00:35:53,616
Retail is the drug
  that everybody goes for.

00:35:53,616 --> 00:35:55,854
They look at that order,
  and they say, "Wow,
  I got to fill that."

00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:57,657
We have retailers
  coming to us,

00:35:57,657 --> 00:35:59,928
and it's just hard for us
  to turn it -- to turn it down.

00:35:59,928 --> 00:36:01,565
Look, it sounds like
  what you guys are good at

00:36:01,565 --> 00:36:03,769
is s.E.O.
  And selling online.

00:36:03,769 --> 00:36:05,105
But I'm getting the sense

00:36:05,105 --> 00:36:07,042
that you think that there's
  a ceiling there.

00:36:07,042 --> 00:36:09,381
Yeah. We're -- We're pretty
  maxed out on s.E.O.

00:36:09,381 --> 00:36:12,087
2011, we were number one
  on "Ugly Christmas sweater,"

00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:13,456
"Ugly Christmas Sweaters."

00:36:13,456 --> 00:36:15,193
HERJAVEC: Do you guys do
  this full time?

00:36:15,193 --> 00:36:18,332
I quit last year
  to focus on this full time.

00:36:18,332 --> 00:36:21,038
And I was getting paid about
  $170,000 a year plus bonus,

00:36:21,038 --> 00:36:22,440
so it was a bit
  of a wake up --
  Wow.

00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,810
You wake up one night.

00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:27,450
You got a $170,000 job, you say,
  "Ugly Christmas Sweaters!"

00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:29,288
I mean,
  I'm -- I'm a risk-Adverse guy.

00:36:29,288 --> 00:36:31,860
It's a testament to --
  to me believing in this.

00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,864
Like, I-I really
  wouldn't walk away

00:36:33,864 --> 00:36:36,770
from a $170,000 job
  on a -- on a whim.

00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:38,573
Okay, but we know
  the sweaters are ugly,

00:36:38,573 --> 00:36:40,009
but also the valuation
  is ugly.

00:36:40,009 --> 00:36:42,748
Why don't you try and defend
  why this is worth $2 million?

00:36:42,748 --> 00:36:45,521
The reason our valuation
  is at that point

00:36:45,521 --> 00:36:48,794
is last year, we -- You know,
  we had $862,000 in sales.

00:36:48,794 --> 00:36:51,065
It would have --
  if we would have not run out,

00:36:51,065 --> 00:36:52,802
we would have had
  a little over a million.

00:36:52,802 --> 00:36:55,274
Well, I'm looking at it, saying
  you have to give a discount

00:36:55,274 --> 00:36:57,611
for the fact there's risk in
  the seasonality in the return.

00:36:57,611 --> 00:36:59,349
Yeah, you know what? Don't ever
  listen to Kevin on that stuff.

00:36:59,349 --> 00:37:01,720
He's the worst
  at valuations.
  I'm very good
  at it, actually.

00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,457
I mean, you guys have --
  your -- your problem

00:37:03,457 --> 00:37:04,860
is not valuation,
  all right.

00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,831
If you're going to grow --
  Really?

00:37:06,831 --> 00:37:09,635
Yeah, because some of us know
  how to grow past the valuation.

00:37:09,635 --> 00:37:13,477
Some people look backwards.
  Some of us look forward.
  So, Mark, why don't you give
  them a $4 million valuation?

00:37:13,477 --> 00:37:15,882
But doesn't matter.
  The valuation isn't the issue.
  Well, that's --
  It doesn't matter.

00:37:15,882 --> 00:37:17,184
It's where you can go.

00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:19,188
But the problem I have is that
  you really haven't explained

00:37:19,188 --> 00:37:20,457
how you're going to grow.

00:37:20,457 --> 00:37:22,428
I know you guys hate
  when it sounds like people

00:37:22,428 --> 00:37:24,666
are, you know, getting away
  from their core competency.

00:37:24,666 --> 00:37:26,269
It -- it probably sounds
  like that.

00:37:26,269 --> 00:37:28,541
But it's -- It's really
  easily duplicating

00:37:28,541 --> 00:37:30,478
what's worked here,
  and from our point of view,

00:37:30,478 --> 00:37:33,551
we're maxing out everything
  we can possibly think of

00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:34,920
when it comes
  to the E-Commerce side.
  And that's the problem.

00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:39,430
Trying to do everything
  is what scares me significantly.

00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,832
And so even though I think
  you've got a good business,

00:37:40,832 --> 00:37:43,304
a growing business,
  I'm out.

00:37:44,873 --> 00:37:48,247
Greiner: I think you're
  on a really good start,

00:37:48,247 --> 00:37:50,819
but there's other companies
  that do this.

00:37:50,819 --> 00:37:53,191
There's nothing unique.

00:37:53,191 --> 00:37:54,293
I'm out.

00:38:00,773 --> 00:38:01,975
I'm gonna make you an offer.

00:38:01,975 --> 00:38:03,912
Here's how it works.

00:38:03,912 --> 00:38:05,916
I'm gonna give you
  the $100,000.

00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:09,524
I want $2 a sweater
  till I recapture my 100K,

00:38:09,524 --> 00:38:12,395
then it drops to $1 a sweater
  in perpetuity.

00:38:12,395 --> 00:38:14,934
What equity
  are you taking?
  Zero. Zero equity.

00:38:14,934 --> 00:38:16,404
And would you be involved
  in the business,

00:38:16,404 --> 00:38:18,742
or would you
  mostly just be treating it

00:38:18,742 --> 00:38:20,145
kind of like
  as a source of capital?

00:38:20,145 --> 00:38:22,483
I-I work with All
  my entrepreneurs,

00:38:22,483 --> 00:38:23,919
and I do everything I can
  to optimize

00:38:23,919 --> 00:38:25,256
'cause our incentives
  are aligned.

00:38:25,256 --> 00:38:26,224
I'm about money.

00:38:26,224 --> 00:38:27,894
John:
  So I'm actually shocked.

00:38:27,894 --> 00:38:29,631
Scrooge has made you guys
  an offer.

00:38:29,631 --> 00:38:31,067
Do you like his offer?

00:38:31,067 --> 00:38:33,472
I'd love to hear if --
  if there's any other
  offers on the table,

00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,774
but we're definitely
  interested.

00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,488
Herjavec: So, it's an
  interesting offer from Kevin.

00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:43,625
It's actually not
  that bad an offer.

00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:44,962
It's bad,
  but not that bad.

00:38:44,962 --> 00:38:47,567
I love the fact
  that you left

00:38:47,567 --> 00:38:51,341
a $175,000-a-year job
  to do this,

00:38:51,341 --> 00:38:54,347
because that tells me
  you're all in, my friend,

00:38:54,347 --> 00:38:57,554
and I love that level
  of commitment to it.

00:38:57,554 --> 00:38:58,823
There's no going back
  for you.

00:38:58,823 --> 00:39:00,427
No.

00:39:00,427 --> 00:39:02,063
I don't have a problem
  with the retail.

00:39:02,063 --> 00:39:04,067
You know, I think
  when you start out,

00:39:04,067 --> 00:39:05,337
you try everything.

00:39:05,337 --> 00:39:07,039
So here's my offer
  to you.

00:39:09,143 --> 00:39:10,614
$100,000 for 10%.

00:39:13,686 --> 00:39:16,525
Daymond's being very quiet.
  So we'd also like to --
  Yeah.

00:39:16,525 --> 00:39:18,162
Yes, he is.
  What are you doing?

00:39:23,072 --> 00:39:27,581
Robert -- $100,000,
  10% of the company.

00:39:27,581 --> 00:39:31,255
Kevin -- $2 Per sweater
  until you get your money back,
  I'm not greedy.
  I don't need a --

00:39:31,255 --> 00:39:33,526
till you get $100,000 back,
  and then $1 in Perpetuity.

00:39:33,526 --> 00:39:34,796
Yes, that's correct,
  Daymond.

00:39:36,232 --> 00:39:37,769
And you're
  going to do what?

00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,810
You're the clothing man.

00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:44,281
Yeah, um...

00:39:49,693 --> 00:39:51,596
Oh, this is hard.

00:39:59,212 --> 00:40:01,717
Narrator:
  Two sharks are out.

00:40:01,717 --> 00:40:03,687
Nick and Evan have two offers
  on the table

00:40:03,687 --> 00:40:05,024
from Robert and Kevin,

00:40:05,024 --> 00:40:08,230
but the clothing expert,
  Daymond, is on the fence.

00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,232
Oh, this is hard.

00:40:10,801 --> 00:40:12,505
I'm really --
  I'm falling in love

00:40:12,505 --> 00:40:14,008
with the product
  and the guys.

00:40:14,008 --> 00:40:17,115
I just -- I still have inventory
  of ugly sweaters.

00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:18,484
Exactly.
  That's the challenge.

00:40:18,484 --> 00:40:20,321
And you'll be selling those
  to me.
  [ laughs ]

00:40:20,321 --> 00:40:24,663
My challenge is exactly
  what mark has been saying.

00:40:24,663 --> 00:40:26,734
This is very seasonal.
  You guys are doing great.

00:40:26,734 --> 00:40:29,907
You guys are doing
  what I cannot do online, s.E.O.

00:40:29,907 --> 00:40:32,011
You're gonna go
  to these big guys,

00:40:32,011 --> 00:40:33,715
and after they're
  through with you guys,

00:40:33,715 --> 00:40:35,184
they just let it go.
  Mendelsohn: And it's not --

00:40:35,184 --> 00:40:37,489
We're not relying on
  their business. It's --
  It's just adding --

00:40:37,489 --> 00:40:39,259
right, but if you're not relying
  on their business,

00:40:39,259 --> 00:40:41,062
then I can't be of service
  to you.

00:40:41,062 --> 00:40:44,570
You guys can go to $5 million
  and $10 million without anybody.

00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,039
And --
  but you can help add
  to what we're doing

00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:48,010
on the online side with your
  distribution channels and...

00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:49,747
I can't.
  I can't add to that.

00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:51,150
You guys
  are already doing that.

00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,121
That's what
  mark is saying.
  He's a retail king.

00:40:53,121 --> 00:40:54,557
So if you're going
  the retail strategy --
  I'm the retail king.

00:40:54,557 --> 00:40:55,826
I can make --
  I can make goods for you,

00:40:55,826 --> 00:40:57,362
but you're making the goods
  at the same price, so...

00:40:58,899 --> 00:40:59,935
...I'm out.

00:41:02,706 --> 00:41:04,243
O'Leary: So you have two offers
  on the table.

00:41:04,243 --> 00:41:06,481
You basically have one from me

00:41:06,481 --> 00:41:08,485
that doesn't take any
  of your equity away.

00:41:08,485 --> 00:41:10,155
I give you $100,000.

00:41:10,155 --> 00:41:12,493
You pay me $2 a sweater
  until I get my capital back

00:41:12,493 --> 00:41:14,363
and then $1 in perpetuity.

00:41:14,363 --> 00:41:16,067
Or you have
  an offer from Robert,

00:41:16,067 --> 00:41:19,574
which was $100,000
  for 10% equity.

00:41:21,344 --> 00:41:23,214
Evan, I'm just really
  investing in you guys.

00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:25,353
I think that you can
  build this up.

00:41:25,353 --> 00:41:28,526
I think the college market
  is gonna go huge for you guys.

00:41:28,526 --> 00:41:30,329
I want to participate
  in the company.

00:41:30,329 --> 00:41:32,500
Kevin just wants to suck money
  right off the top.

00:41:34,104 --> 00:41:35,439
You know,
  in the spirit of Christmas,

00:41:35,439 --> 00:41:37,977
I'm not stealing
  your equity like Robert is.

00:41:37,977 --> 00:41:39,614
There's a lump of coal
  over there.

00:41:39,614 --> 00:41:42,922
[ indistinct whispering ]

00:41:51,038 --> 00:41:53,442
Mr. Wonderful...

00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,016
...we appreciate your offer,

00:41:57,016 --> 00:41:59,220
but, Robert,
  we accept your offer.

00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,724
Excellent, guys.
  Thank you.
  O'Leary: Oh!

00:42:00,724 --> 00:42:03,128
Excellent. Yeah.
  Greiner: Congratulations.

00:42:03,128 --> 00:42:04,665
Thank you very much.
  Good job, guys.
  Good job.

00:42:04,665 --> 00:42:06,101
Thank you.
  Very, very impressive.

00:42:06,101 --> 00:42:07,638
Congratulations, guys.
  John:
  Congratulations.

00:42:07,638 --> 00:42:09,007
Wow. Great job.
  Great job, guys.

00:42:09,007 --> 00:42:10,042
Morton: Whoo!

00:42:10,042 --> 00:42:11,078
MENDELSOHN: That was good.
  That's good.

00:42:11,078 --> 00:42:12,180
Yeah,
  that was awesome.

00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,650
Kevin, how many versions
  of a royalty deal

00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:14,719
can you possibly do?

00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:16,138
That's why I love me.

00:42:16,138 --> 00:42:17,539
[ chuckles ]

00:42:17,539 --> 00:42:19,041
whoo!
  MENDELSOHN: Yes!

00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:20,342
Tipsy Elves!

00:42:20,342 --> 00:42:23,078
A deal with Robert was really
  a-a Christmas wish for us.

00:42:23,078 --> 00:42:25,347
Yeah, our Christmas dreams
  definitely came True today.

00:42:25,347 --> 00:42:26,548
All: Tipsy Elves! Whoo!
