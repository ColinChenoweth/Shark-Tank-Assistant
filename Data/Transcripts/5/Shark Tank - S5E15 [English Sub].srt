NARRATOR:
  This is the Shark Tank,

00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:09,051
where hopeful entrepreneurs

00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:11,790
get a once-in-a-lifetime chance
  to pitch the sharks

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,461
in hopes
  of getting an investment

00:00:13,461 --> 00:00:16,400
to start, grow,
  or save their businesses.

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,804
I'm asking for $150,000...

00:00:18,804 --> 00:00:20,375
...For 30% of my company.

00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:22,212
NARRATOR: The entrepreneurs
  must convince a shark

00:00:22,212 --> 00:00:24,316
to invest the full amount
  they're asking for,

00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,587
or they'll walk away
  with nothing.

00:00:26,587 --> 00:00:28,324
Someone wants
  to come after my business

00:00:28,324 --> 00:00:30,996
and take the food out of
  my kids' mouths, I will fight!

00:00:30,996 --> 00:00:33,835
I started this company
  'cause I was --

00:00:33,835 --> 00:00:35,338
I was diagnosed with skin cancer
  at 26.

00:00:35,338 --> 00:00:37,777
[ voice breaking ] I know
  I am just starting, but...

00:00:37,777 --> 00:00:39,380
This is my passion.

00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,218
I haven't have any food
  for eight days.

00:00:42,218 --> 00:00:44,490
You are so full of crap!
  I don't get you.

00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:45,726
CUBAN:
  You're the one who told us

00:00:45,726 --> 00:00:46,962
you know your company
  inside and out.

00:00:46,962 --> 00:00:48,999
We have sold
  a half a million of these.

00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:50,536
Wow!
  what?!

00:00:50,536 --> 00:00:52,540
NARRATOR:
  If the sharks hear a great idea,

00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,045
they're ready to invest
  using their own money.

00:00:55,045 --> 00:00:56,281
I want to give you
  an opportunity.

00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:58,118
NARRATOR: And they're willing
  to fight each other

00:00:58,118 --> 00:00:59,922
for a piece of the action.

00:00:59,922 --> 00:01:01,391
O'LEARY:
  I'll give you $75,000.

00:01:01,391 --> 00:01:03,328
I want a royalty of 7%.

00:01:03,328 --> 00:01:05,232
I say I give you the $150,000,

00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,269
and we tell this bozo
  to take a walk.

00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:08,305
Ohh!

00:01:09,474 --> 00:01:10,910
NARRATOR:
  Who are the sharks?

00:01:12,313 --> 00:01:15,152
They're self-made millionaire
  and billionaire investors

00:01:15,152 --> 00:01:17,658
who are entrepreneurs
  themselves.

00:01:17,658 --> 00:01:20,062
Kevin o'Leary
  is a venture capitalist

00:01:20,062 --> 00:01:22,768
who turned a $10,000 loan

00:01:22,768 --> 00:01:27,411
into a software business
  worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:27,411 --> 00:01:29,848
Daymond John is
  a fashion and branding expert

00:01:29,848 --> 00:01:31,887
who grew
  his homemade clothing line

00:01:31,887 --> 00:01:35,160
into the globally recognized
  fashion brand Fubu,

00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,566
with over $6 billion
  in retail sales to date.

00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:41,740
Robert Herjavec, the son
  of an immigrant factory worker,

00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,411
is now a technology mogul

00:01:44,411 --> 00:01:48,954
who sold his first internet
  companies for over $350 million.

Lori Greiner, the queen of QVC,

notorious billionaire
  entrepreneur, tech guru,

00:02:03,684 --> 00:02:07,692
and the outspoken owner
  of the NBA's Dallas mavericks.

00:02:15,441 --> 00:02:18,313
[ birds chirping ]

00:02:18,313 --> 00:02:21,721
We have to put on our sunscreen.
  we got to be sun-safe.

00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:23,925
I'm Betsy Johnson. I live
  in prairie village, Kansas,

00:02:23,925 --> 00:02:25,729
with my amazing husband, Matt,
  and my adorable son, Andy.

00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:29,135
Do you want to go outside?
  Time for a walk!

00:02:29,135 --> 00:02:31,006
I was diagnosed with skin cancer
  at 26.

00:02:31,006 --> 00:02:32,910
And it was actually
  one of the scariest things

00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,945
that ever happened to me.

00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,549
I quickly learned
  that one bad sunburn

00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:38,054
can really affect people
  for the rest of their lives.

00:02:38,054 --> 00:02:41,160
So I decided that I wanted
  to start a business

00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,997
to keep everybody sun-safe.

00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:45,569
JOHNSON: Hey, Ber!
  hi, Bets! How's it going?

00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:50,345
It can be a bit of a struggle,
  because he lives in Pittsburgh.

00:02:50,345 --> 00:02:52,516
Thankfully, for the internet,
  it makes it possible

00:02:52,516 --> 00:02:54,253
for Berry and I
  to be in the same room.

00:02:54,253 --> 00:02:56,123
I know
  that we're gonna be big.

00:02:56,123 --> 00:02:58,228
Berry has reservations
  about coming on "Shark Tank,"

00:02:58,228 --> 00:02:59,931
because he thinks
  we can do it on our own

00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:01,535
without giving up
  any of our company.

00:03:01,535 --> 00:03:03,204
But I feel
  we don't have the experience

00:03:03,204 --> 00:03:05,008
and the business connections
  like the sharks.

00:03:05,008 --> 00:03:07,145
If we don't get a deal
  with the sharks,

00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,649
I don't think
  our business can grow as big

00:03:08,649 --> 00:03:10,686
as it actually could be.

00:03:25,616 --> 00:03:27,688
Hi, sharks. I'm Betsy Johnson.

00:03:27,688 --> 00:03:29,291
And I'm Berry wanless.

00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,094
BOTH: And we are the siblings
  behind Swimzip...

00:03:31,094 --> 00:03:32,731
A sun-protective
  swimwear line.

00:03:32,731 --> 00:03:36,873
WANLESS: We're seeking $60,000
  for a 5% stake in Swimzip.

00:03:36,873 --> 00:03:39,345
JOHNSON: As parents,
  we want to keep our babies safe

00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:42,150
and protected
  from the sun's harmful rays.

00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:46,359
No matter how diligently
  we apply and reapply sunscreen,

00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,697
we are still subjecting
  our children's skin

00:03:48,697 --> 00:03:51,869
to the harsh sun and
  potentially painful sunburns.

00:03:51,869 --> 00:03:54,775
Taking kids to the pool
  and beach should be fun,

00:03:54,775 --> 00:03:57,214
but with all the screaming
  and fighting and fussing,

00:03:57,214 --> 00:04:00,822
traditional sun-protective
  methods are such a chore.

00:04:00,822 --> 00:04:02,157
There has to be
  a better way.

00:04:02,157 --> 00:04:03,828
You got it!
  there has to be
  a better way.

00:04:03,828 --> 00:04:07,334
Let us introduce you
  to the super-stylish

00:04:07,334 --> 00:04:08,838
U.V.-protective swimwear line

00:04:08,838 --> 00:04:12,379
that keeps kids sun-safe
  and parents sane.

00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:14,115
Swimzip features
  our signature full-length zipper

00:04:14,115 --> 00:04:15,351
down the front,

00:04:15,351 --> 00:04:17,989
so it's extremely easy
  to put on and take off.

00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:19,993
And both our tops
  and our bottoms

00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:25,304
block 98% of U.V.A.
  and U.V.B. cancer-causing rays.

00:04:25,304 --> 00:04:28,244
In fact, Swimzip's
  sun-protective swimwear

00:04:28,244 --> 00:04:30,381
is so simple to put on,

00:04:30,381 --> 00:04:32,987
kids can literally
  do it themselves.

00:04:32,987 --> 00:04:35,558
Just one quick zip
  leads to a day

00:04:35,558 --> 00:04:38,230
full of
  easy sun protection.
  wow!
  good job!

00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,869
All right, sharks,
  who wants to zip up this deal?

00:04:40,869 --> 00:04:43,742
Are you designing and
  manufacturing all of this today?

00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,579
Yep. I do
  all the designs myself.

00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:46,881
We create all the prints.

00:04:46,881 --> 00:04:48,952
We work directly
  with the manufacturer.

00:04:48,952 --> 00:04:50,322
It's very stylish.
  I love the little stuff.

00:04:50,322 --> 00:04:52,226
Really quick,
  we got samples for you, so...

00:04:52,226 --> 00:04:53,562
GREINER:
  oh, great. Great.

00:04:53,562 --> 00:04:54,397
Totally.

00:04:54,397 --> 00:04:56,434
Yeah.
  thanks.

00:04:56,434 --> 00:04:57,670
GREINER:
  thank you.

00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,273
JOHN: Thank you.

00:04:59,273 --> 00:05:00,709
Is this an adult-size?

00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:02,146
No. It's actually
  the kid-size.

00:05:02,146 --> 00:05:03,348
Thanks, bud.

00:05:03,348 --> 00:05:04,717
Our swimsuits
  actually come as sets,

00:05:04,717 --> 00:05:06,421
so you get
  both a top and a bottom

00:05:06,421 --> 00:05:08,125
when you purchase
  our product.

00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,728
Wave bye!
  say thanks!

00:05:09,728 --> 00:05:10,864
HERJAVEC:
  See you guys!
  Bye, guys!

00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:15,874
What are your sales?

00:05:15,874 --> 00:05:17,376
We sold $225,000
  this year.

00:05:17,376 --> 00:05:18,646
HERJAVEC:
  Was that your first year?

00:05:18,646 --> 00:05:20,149
That's our third year
  in business.

00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:22,754
Third year. What were the sales
  the second year?

00:05:22,754 --> 00:05:26,127
The second year, $18,000,
  so we've grown 1,100%.

00:05:26,127 --> 00:05:27,531
How are you selling them?

00:05:27,531 --> 00:05:29,635
We sell on Amazon.
  We sell on our website.

00:05:29,635 --> 00:05:31,172
We also sell
  on the target website.

00:05:31,172 --> 00:05:33,109
We also sell
  in high-end hotels.

00:05:33,109 --> 00:05:35,113
JOHN: You're selling
  to the independent stores?

00:05:35,113 --> 00:05:37,050
Yeah.
  It's fairly small, right?

00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,452
It is fairly small
  right now.

00:05:38,452 --> 00:05:41,725
We have stores that sell
  in Japan, Germany, Guam.

00:05:41,725 --> 00:05:43,830
What are you
  making it for?

00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,066
$5 to $7.

00:05:45,066 --> 00:05:47,537
O'LEARY:
  What were your profits?
  $100,000.

00:05:47,537 --> 00:05:48,941
But you didn't pay yourselves
  anything, right?

00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:50,410
We currently
  don't take a salary.

00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,447
O'LEARY:
  So, you've basically told me
  it's worth $1.2 million.

00:05:52,447 --> 00:05:55,220
You're offering me 5%
  for $60,000, right?

00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,192
Mm-hmm.
  You're making $100,000
  without paying yourselves.

00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:00,029
If you each paid yourself
  $50,000,

00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:02,268
which is not unreasonable,
  you make nothing.

00:06:02,268 --> 00:06:03,437
This year, yes.

00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:07,979
Is there anything unique about
  the materials that you're using?

00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:09,949
Nope.
  It's swimsuit material.

00:06:11,253 --> 00:06:13,557
HERJAVEC:
  the material is not unique.

00:06:13,557 --> 00:06:16,596
What makes you unique
  is the fact that you have

00:06:16,596 --> 00:06:19,569
that same material
  with a zipper up the front.

00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:20,604
That's it.

00:06:20,604 --> 00:06:21,974
No.
  Well, that's part of it.

00:06:21,974 --> 00:06:23,878
What really sets it apart
  are our designs.

00:06:23,878 --> 00:06:26,316
Betsy designs
  all of these suits herself.

00:06:26,316 --> 00:06:29,222
But where we really come in
  is that our price point

00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,259
is $15 wholesale,
  top and bottom.

00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:35,100
The people who we're
  competing with are $45 to $60.

00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,537
Without a zipper.

00:06:36,537 --> 00:06:38,574
We're trying to get at what
  this business is really worth.

00:06:38,574 --> 00:06:41,480
I think because you've
  established some market share

00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,751
and you've proven you can
  design it -- I don't know --

00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:45,956
I'd put a value on it
  of half a million bucks, maybe,

00:06:45,956 --> 00:06:48,728
but it's not worth
  $1.2 million.

00:06:48,728 --> 00:06:52,602
Let's ask our Fubu
  retail clothing guy.

00:06:52,602 --> 00:06:54,273
Can I set this up myself
  for $500,000?

00:06:54,273 --> 00:06:55,810
Yes.

00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,414
So, what do
  I need you for?

00:06:59,818 --> 00:07:01,755
I look at my money
  as gasoline.

00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,525
I want to pour it
  on something

00:07:03,525 --> 00:07:05,663
that I already understand
  how it works.

00:07:05,663 --> 00:07:08,602
I just add money. I make
  more money. That's what I love.

00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:12,777
There's no place
  for me to pour my money into.

00:07:12,777 --> 00:07:15,716
I don't see it here.

00:07:15,716 --> 00:07:17,018
I'm out.

00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:21,395
We are
  on the target website,

00:07:21,395 --> 00:07:23,432
and we actually have
  an exclusive line for them.

00:07:23,432 --> 00:07:25,269
They have not taken you
  into the stores yet?

00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:27,407
No. We're trying to work
  right now to do a test
  in the Southern stores.

00:07:27,407 --> 00:07:28,977
JOHN:
  you don't want to do that.

00:07:30,446 --> 00:07:31,515
Why not?

00:07:31,515 --> 00:07:34,722
The big guys and girls
  can crush you

00:07:34,722 --> 00:07:36,859
with just
  one set of returns.

00:07:36,859 --> 00:07:38,095
Yeah.

00:07:38,095 --> 00:07:40,065
Their margins
  are so, so small.

00:07:40,065 --> 00:07:42,504
You want to stay where you are,
  with the boutiques.

00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:45,410
But that's
  part of the problem here.

00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,881
You're a little green
  in understanding all this.

00:07:47,881 --> 00:07:49,885
Now, I have to
  take my hat off to you.

00:07:49,885 --> 00:07:51,856
You made it past
  the hardest point --

00:07:51,856 --> 00:07:54,128
to show proof of concept.
  well -- yeah.

00:07:54,128 --> 00:07:55,597
But there's bad stuff
  coming.

00:07:55,597 --> 00:07:59,271
It's a tough one for me, because
  I see the growth potential here.

00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,586
It's just a little too early
  for me, so I'm out.

00:08:09,525 --> 00:08:11,195
JOHNSON:
  I started this company

00:08:11,195 --> 00:08:13,767
'cause I was diagnosed
  with skin cancer at 26.

00:08:13,767 --> 00:08:16,339
[ voice breaking ]
  and, you know...

00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:18,811
I had insurance
  and a paycheck...

00:08:18,811 --> 00:08:20,080
And quit.

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,854
I decided to try to take
  this on, and this is my passion.

00:08:23,854 --> 00:08:26,460
Like, I know this company
  and sun protection

00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,962
is the wave of the future,

00:08:27,962 --> 00:08:29,699
and we're starting
  with swimwear.

00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:31,837
And, you know,
  I still have a lot to learn.

00:08:33,574 --> 00:08:35,778
But I'm a fighter,
  and I will build this brand,

00:08:35,778 --> 00:08:37,148
and I will build this swimwear

00:08:37,148 --> 00:08:40,187
to be the best swimwear line
  that kids can have.

00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,492
I'm a mommy on a mission.

00:08:42,492 --> 00:08:47,335
My 1-year-old is just --
  he is my world.

00:08:47,335 --> 00:08:48,738
And we go to the park,

00:08:48,738 --> 00:08:51,611
and he wears his Swimzips,
  because I can't find anything.

00:08:51,611 --> 00:08:54,215
I am pushing this product.

00:08:54,215 --> 00:08:58,224
I know I am just starting,
  and I have made mistakes,

00:08:58,224 --> 00:09:00,662
but we will bring this company
  to something huge.

00:09:00,662 --> 00:09:03,368
And, you know, I just --
  i-i don't think you understand.

00:09:03,368 --> 00:09:05,372
We're just at the tip
  of the iceberg here.

00:09:07,276 --> 00:09:12,086
$225,000 sales is nothing
  to laugh at by -- by any means.

00:09:12,086 --> 00:09:14,156
And I think Daymond's right --
  you are green.

00:09:14,156 --> 00:09:16,695
But, you know, frankly,
  all of us up here,

00:09:16,695 --> 00:09:19,968
if we knew the things we should
  be afraid of in business,

00:09:19,968 --> 00:09:21,505
we may have never started.

00:09:21,505 --> 00:09:22,941
[ laughs ]
  Right?

00:09:22,941 --> 00:09:24,310
Yeah, that's true.

00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,615
And what is really apparent
  about you and you, Berry,

00:09:26,615 --> 00:09:27,784
is that, you know,

00:09:27,784 --> 00:09:31,425
the best way to get over
  doubt and inexperience

00:09:31,425 --> 00:09:32,861
is simply action.

00:09:34,431 --> 00:09:36,902
I'm just struggling with,
  how do you go

00:09:36,902 --> 00:09:41,645
from a little boutique business
  to millions of dollars?

00:09:41,645 --> 00:09:42,982
I don't have the answer.

00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,986
And because
  I don't see the answer,

00:09:44,986 --> 00:09:46,823
I'm not gonna give you
  my money today.

00:09:46,823 --> 00:09:47,825
I'm out.

00:09:53,402 --> 00:09:55,674
Betsy, you're a beast.

00:09:55,674 --> 00:09:57,845
Thanks.
  and that's
  an enormous compliment.

00:09:57,845 --> 00:09:59,582
Berry, you're there to help her,
  and that's a great thing.

00:09:59,582 --> 00:10:01,686
But you're still
  a family business.

00:10:01,686 --> 00:10:04,124
And family businesses aren't
  to the point of their life cycle

00:10:04,124 --> 00:10:05,828
where they can just explode.

00:10:05,828 --> 00:10:07,965
You haven't even broken out

00:10:07,965 --> 00:10:10,437
of the "I'm hiring my friends
  and family" mode yet.

00:10:10,437 --> 00:10:12,208
Then you get to 10 employees
  or 15 employees.

00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,011
Then you have to manage
  those employees, right?

00:10:14,011 --> 00:10:16,683
It's just a huge step.
  and until you get to that step,

00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:18,888
it's much more difficult
  to be ignited

00:10:18,888 --> 00:10:20,758
and to have
  that inflection point.

00:10:20,758 --> 00:10:22,461
And honestly,
  I learned a lot of lessons

00:10:22,461 --> 00:10:24,700
from the 30 companies
  I've invested in on "Shark Tank"

00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,969
that proved that point to me.

00:10:25,969 --> 00:10:27,571
Well, I want
  a strategic investor.

00:10:27,571 --> 00:10:29,308
I don't want to be
  a family business.

00:10:29,308 --> 00:10:32,616
Like I said, I want this
  out there, and I need the help.

00:10:32,616 --> 00:10:33,985
I'm out.

00:10:38,861 --> 00:10:41,767
Okay, we have one shark left.
  Lori?

00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:45,942
You know, I was a one-man band
  for five years.

00:10:45,942 --> 00:10:49,016
I had passion and drive
  and a dream, and I made it.

00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:51,120
I'm sitting here today.

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,122
JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:10:52,122 --> 00:10:54,359
I see so much of that
  in you.

00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:55,728
Thank you.

00:10:55,728 --> 00:10:59,236
Because you are not only smart,
  you're right on trend,

00:10:59,236 --> 00:11:02,944
because melanoma is
  one of the number-one killers.

00:11:02,944 --> 00:11:04,079
Yeah.

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,583
And it starts in children.

00:11:07,352 --> 00:11:08,321
So...

00:11:10,993 --> 00:11:13,365
...I want to give you
  an opportunity here,

00:11:13,365 --> 00:11:15,034
because I believe in you.

00:11:15,034 --> 00:11:17,506
So, I'm going to give you
  the $60,000

00:11:17,506 --> 00:11:20,446
for a 20% equity stake.

00:11:22,483 --> 00:11:26,224
I personally want you
  to be open to going into target

00:11:26,224 --> 00:11:27,660
and other places,

00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,132
but we're just going to ask
  for terms that don't hurt us.

00:11:30,132 --> 00:11:31,568
I love that.
  so, no returns.

00:11:31,568 --> 00:11:33,405
You're --
  see, this is what I need,

00:11:33,405 --> 00:11:35,643
is I need the experience,
  and you've done it.

00:11:35,643 --> 00:11:37,748
Well, you're doing really well
  yourself,

00:11:37,748 --> 00:11:39,652
and that's why
  I want to get behind you --

00:11:39,652 --> 00:11:41,923
because sometimes, you just
  have to get behind people

00:11:41,923 --> 00:11:43,993
that are doing
  the right thing.
  thank you.

00:11:43,993 --> 00:11:46,231
So, that's my offer.

00:11:46,231 --> 00:11:50,573
That's evaluation of you
  at $300,000.

00:11:50,573 --> 00:11:51,709
That's fair.

00:11:52,844 --> 00:11:54,080
Because you don't make
  any money.

00:11:59,391 --> 00:12:01,162
I think it's too low.

00:12:04,335 --> 00:12:05,503
You know what, Lori?

00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,976
Would you be willing
  to do $120,000 for 20%?

00:12:07,976 --> 00:12:08,978
Ohh!

  Four sharks are out.

  have an offer from Lori --

00:12:23,941 --> 00:12:26,380
$60,000
  for 20% of their company --

00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,884

  a counteroffer,

Would you be willing
  to do $120,000 for 20%?

00:12:33,494 --> 00:12:34,429
Ohh!

00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:39,272
We were at $60,000 for 20%.
  CUBAN: Dang!

00:12:39,272 --> 00:12:43,013
So --
  I had a lot of confidence in you
  four or five minutes ago.

00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:45,584
It's your drive, your passion,
  that hard work,

00:12:45,584 --> 00:12:47,488
what I think you can do.

00:12:47,488 --> 00:12:49,927
But now
  I'm getting worried,

00:12:49,927 --> 00:12:51,998
because you're showing me
  a different side.

00:12:51,998 --> 00:12:55,772
You have to
  gain my confidence back now.

00:12:55,772 --> 00:12:58,878
I'm not going to change my
  number, but I want to make sure

00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:01,049
that I've just picked
  the right person.

00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:02,586
Well, I do believe in it.

00:13:02,586 --> 00:13:04,356
I just want to -- I want to
  make sure I have enough capital.

CUBAN: You're the one
  who came in that asked for
  a specific amount of money.

00:13:06,627 --> 00:13:09,033
You're the one who
  told us you know your
  company inside and out.

00:13:09,033 --> 00:13:11,137
You're the one who told us
  you only need the expertise.
  we value at five-times sales,

00:13:11,137 --> 00:13:12,941
and she's devaluing
  our company,

00:13:12,941 --> 00:13:14,477
and I believe
  that it's worth that.
  yeah, but, Betsy,
  hang on a second.

00:13:14,477 --> 00:13:15,947
[ sharks arguing ]

00:13:15,947 --> 00:13:18,017
100% of nothing
  is still nothing!
  you make no money!

You have no paycheck.

JOHN: Berry,
  why aren't you saying much?

00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,167
Why are you so hesitant?

00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:30,075
'cause I think I'm the reason
  that she's not saying yes.

00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:31,879
Why? Why not?
  why isn't she
  saying yes?

00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:33,214
Because I believe
  in our company.

00:13:33,214 --> 00:13:35,018
I think we are gonna be
  a $5 million company.

00:13:35,018 --> 00:13:37,457
And if we're giving someone
  this 20% stake right now,

00:13:37,457 --> 00:13:39,895
it's a huge, huge part
  of our business.

I don't want to push you
  into anything.

  we are gonna do this!

WANLESS: I think I was
  a little hesitant at first

00:14:27,057 --> 00:14:29,061
because we do
  value our company a lot

00:14:29,061 --> 00:14:31,266
and we do anticipate
  huge sales.

00:14:31,266 --> 00:14:33,671
But I do think,
  at the end of the day,
  it was the right deal

00:14:33,671 --> 00:14:35,875
and that Lori's gonna be
  fantastic, a fantastic partner.

00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,278
We're really excited
  about that.

NARRATOR: In season 2,

00:14:43,256 --> 00:14:45,561
Kimberly Nelson made a deal
  with Barbara Corcoran

00:14:45,561 --> 00:14:48,367
for her homemade-cake business,
  Daisy Cakes.

00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:49,736
What do you think?
  Do we have a deal?

00:14:49,736 --> 00:14:50,805
Of course.

00:14:50,805 --> 00:14:51,674
Whew!

00:14:51,674 --> 00:14:53,811
Let's see what she's doing now.

00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:57,118
Daisy Cakes has gone through
  some major changes

00:14:57,118 --> 00:14:58,621
since my last update.

00:14:58,621 --> 00:15:01,861
On my last update, we moved
  all the baking out of state

00:15:01,861 --> 00:15:03,564
to a large-production bakery.

00:15:03,564 --> 00:15:06,036
It seemed like the only way
  to meet the demand

00:15:06,036 --> 00:15:08,040
and keep my customers happy.

00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,180
For a few months,
  everything was good.

00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,821
And then things just started
  to spiral downward.

00:15:14,821 --> 00:15:17,860
We made a couple
  of really poor hiring decisions,

00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,733
and the quality of the cakes
  was so bad,

00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:24,540
we lost nearly $150,000
  in bad product.

00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,976
The worst part is,

00:15:25,976 --> 00:15:29,283
that damaged our reputation
  with our most loyal customers.

00:15:29,283 --> 00:15:31,254
We take a lot of pride

00:15:31,254 --> 00:15:34,060
in these Daisy Cakes
  being made the right way.

00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,664
So, with some really good
  words of advice from Barbara,

00:15:36,664 --> 00:15:40,272
we decided to bring
  the Daisy Cakes baking back here

00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,543
to Pauline, South Carolina,
  where it started.

00:15:42,543 --> 00:15:44,514
So, how are y'all doing
  on these? You got enough?

00:15:44,514 --> 00:15:45,717
We're back to basics here,

00:15:45,717 --> 00:15:48,188
and I've hired
  a great team of employees.

00:15:48,188 --> 00:15:49,525
And I learned
  a really big lesson --

00:15:49,525 --> 00:15:51,227
that's that nobody's gonna make
  a Daisy cake

00:15:51,227 --> 00:15:53,064
the way my mom and I
  are gonna make a Daisy cake.

00:15:53,064 --> 00:15:55,703
CORCORAN: I knew I'd be
  finding you hard at work!

00:15:55,703 --> 00:15:57,808
Come on!
  show me the operation!
  oh, my God!

00:15:57,808 --> 00:16:00,112
Barbara has been
  a tremendous support,

00:16:00,112 --> 00:16:03,586
and her guidance has been just
  what we needed for Daisy Cakes.

00:16:03,586 --> 00:16:05,256
Our projected sales
  for Daisy Cakes

00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:08,496
over the next year
  should be close to $3 million.

00:16:08,496 --> 00:16:10,600
Let me tell you something.
  we're just getting started.

00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,070
CORCORAN:
  When you're growing a business,

00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,742
it's a series of mistakes that
  you have to learn to overcome.

00:16:14,742 --> 00:16:18,049
Kim has the magic ingredient
  of every great entrepreneur.

00:16:18,049 --> 00:16:20,588
When she gets hit,
  she pops right back up.

00:16:20,588 --> 00:16:23,359
And that's why Kim is succeeding
  again at Daisy Cakes.

00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:25,230
NELSON: Just because
  you get a deal on "Shark Tank"

00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,802
doesn't mean
  it's going to be an easy road.

00:16:27,802 --> 00:16:29,973
But with Barbara by my side,

00:16:29,973 --> 00:16:32,512
I know the future
  for Daisy Cakes has no limits.

00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,335
NARRATOR: Next into the tank
  is an accomplished entrepreneur

00:16:44,335 --> 00:16:48,510
from San Diego, California,
  with a simple way to stay fit.

00:16:52,485 --> 00:16:53,788
Hello, sharks.

00:16:53,788 --> 00:16:57,729
My name is Phil Black,
  and my company is Fitdeck.

00:16:57,729 --> 00:17:00,702
And I'm seeking $300,000

00:17:00,702 --> 00:17:04,343
in exchange
  for 20% of the company.

00:17:04,343 --> 00:17:08,284
Fitdeck is a custom deck
  of fitness playing cards

00:17:08,284 --> 00:17:13,026
that makes exercise more simple,
  convenient, and fun.

00:17:13,026 --> 00:17:15,298
Each card has an illustration

00:17:15,298 --> 00:17:18,004
and instructions
  on how to perform the exercise.

00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:21,577
So all you need to do
  is shuffle, deal, and go.

00:17:21,577 --> 00:17:22,880
Can we see a package?

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,882
Sure.

00:17:23,882 --> 00:17:25,385
And where are you
  selling them?

00:17:25,385 --> 00:17:28,057
Primarily from our website,
  direct to consumer.

00:17:28,057 --> 00:17:29,493
That's about 75%
  of our business.

00:17:29,493 --> 00:17:30,896
So, why don't you take
  Fitdeck body weight?

00:17:30,896 --> 00:17:32,867
HERJAVEC: Thank you.

00:17:32,867 --> 00:17:34,103
This is cross training,
  Daymond,

00:17:34,103 --> 00:17:35,473
thank you.
  our equivalent to crossfit.

00:17:35,473 --> 00:17:36,608
Thank you.

00:17:36,608 --> 00:17:39,013
And, of course, mark --
  Fitdeck basketball.

00:17:39,013 --> 00:17:40,616
Appreciate that.

00:17:40,616 --> 00:17:42,854
So, sharks,
  who's ready to go all-in?

00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:44,491
HERJAVEC: Okay,
  walk me through a single unit.

00:17:44,491 --> 00:17:46,695
What do you sell it for?
  what does it cost to make?

00:17:46,695 --> 00:17:48,298
That sells for $14.95
  on our website.

00:17:48,298 --> 00:17:49,467
It costs about $2 to make.

00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:51,872
Are you selling
  a lot of these cards right now?

00:17:51,872 --> 00:17:54,744
We have sold a half a million
  of these Fitdecks.

00:17:54,744 --> 00:17:56,715
Wow!
  what?!
  in how long
  a period of time?

00:17:56,715 --> 00:17:58,953
That's been
  over the last seven years or so.

00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:02,293
Ohh.
  the majority of those have been
  in the last four years or so.

00:18:02,293 --> 00:18:03,797
Well, how many
  did you sell last year?

00:18:03,797 --> 00:18:05,801
Last year,
  we sold 55,000.

00:18:05,801 --> 00:18:07,771
So, how many dollars
  is that?

00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:09,407
Last year, $640,000.

00:18:09,407 --> 00:18:12,548
Very impressive.
  what was your profit?

00:18:12,548 --> 00:18:13,917
Last year,
  the profit was a break-even.

00:18:13,917 --> 00:18:16,422
Why? How could you
  only break even?

00:18:16,422 --> 00:18:17,958
HERJAVEC:
  there's something missing.

00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,495
You got to be making
  a ton of money.

00:18:19,495 --> 00:18:22,267
Or you got screwed
  somewhere along the line.

00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,636
Well, last year
  was an anomaly.

00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:26,342
The prior years, we had
  an average of $725,000 in sales

00:18:26,342 --> 00:18:29,181
with an average profit
  of about $120,000.

00:18:29,181 --> 00:18:31,552
So, when your sales dropped,
  your profit was wiped out?

00:18:31,552 --> 00:18:32,856
Correct.

00:18:32,856 --> 00:18:35,227
Okay. So, Phil, here's where
  it doesn't add up for me.

00:18:35,227 --> 00:18:38,901
Let's assume you did $700,000
  two years ago in sales.

00:18:38,901 --> 00:18:42,776
Your cost of goods on that
  would've been $100,000, right?

00:18:42,776 --> 00:18:45,481
That leaves you
  with $600,000.

00:18:45,481 --> 00:18:48,253
You made $100,000.
  that leaves you with $500,000.

00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:52,595
You're spending $500,000
  running a $700,000 company?

00:18:52,595 --> 00:18:54,166
Where's the money going?

00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,403
To some r&amp;d --
  we have to create them.

00:18:56,403 --> 00:19:00,011
It's going to making videos.
  we made 100 videos last year.

00:19:00,011 --> 00:19:02,048
We redid the entire website.

00:19:02,048 --> 00:19:04,486
O'LEARY: Phil, my greatest fear
  for this content

00:19:04,486 --> 00:19:06,825
is that when it moves online
  or into an app,

00:19:06,825 --> 00:19:07,927
it's simply free.

00:19:07,927 --> 00:19:10,833
I mean, if you just Google
  these stretches,

00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,204
there's a ton of content
  that's there for free.

00:19:13,204 --> 00:19:16,243
Well, the problem with that is
  it's so all over the place

00:19:16,243 --> 00:19:18,047
that if you wanted to do it --
  you could type in

00:19:18,047 --> 00:19:19,750
"stretching exercises
  for a bad hamstring" --

00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,821
you're gonna get
  15 million responses.

00:19:21,821 --> 00:19:24,226
And we're breaking it down
  for you to make it very simple.

00:19:24,226 --> 00:19:26,865
What would you like
  the $300,000 for?

00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,268
The $300,000 is gonna amount

00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:30,672
to where we think
  the future of the business is.

00:19:30,672 --> 00:19:34,914
So 75% to 80% of that, we feel
  is going on the digital side.

00:19:34,914 --> 00:19:36,517
You're planning
  to sell that app?
  correct.

00:19:36,517 --> 00:19:38,521
CUBAN:
  that's a tough business.
  we've been selling that app

00:19:38,521 --> 00:19:39,958
for the last --
  that's a very tough space.

00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:42,096
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
  you've been selling --
  you have an app?

00:19:42,096 --> 00:19:43,900
We've been selling it
  for about four or five months.

00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,737
We're getting
  1,000 downloads a month

00:19:45,737 --> 00:19:47,039
with very little marketing.

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,475
It's all free
  at that point, right?

00:19:48,475 --> 00:19:49,811
No, we sell this
  for $9.99.

00:19:49,811 --> 00:19:52,517
How did you come up with this?
  tell us about your background.

00:19:52,517 --> 00:19:54,454
I was a Navy Seal
  for almost six years.

00:19:54,454 --> 00:19:55,523
CUBAN: You were?
  yes.

00:19:55,523 --> 00:19:57,226
Oh! All right. Thank you.
  good for you.

00:19:57,226 --> 00:19:58,629
Yeah, well, actually,
  the idea for Fitdeck

00:19:58,629 --> 00:20:01,535
was based on a card game that I
  played with my college roommates

00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:02,904
at Yale University.

00:20:02,904 --> 00:20:05,410
And it was a game called "pug,"
  short for "push-up game."

00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:08,115
now, this became
  a campus-wide sensation at Yale.

00:20:08,115 --> 00:20:09,885
You know,
  it made an impression on me.

00:20:09,885 --> 00:20:11,322
I graduated from Yale,

00:20:11,322 --> 00:20:13,693
and I went to one of the biggest
  investment banks in the world

00:20:13,693 --> 00:20:14,761
for about 2 1/2 years.

00:20:14,761 --> 00:20:16,098
Which bank was it, Phil?

00:20:16,098 --> 00:20:17,434
It was Goldman Sachs.
  no kidding.

00:20:17,434 --> 00:20:19,604
Ah!
  oh, my God.
  so, hang on. Hang on.

00:20:19,604 --> 00:20:21,375
You -- you have a degree
  from Yale.

00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,680
You were an investment banker,
  and that wasn't enough,

00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,516
so then
  you were a Navy Seal.

00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:28,857
I came to my senses after
  the investment banking
  and became a seal.

00:20:28,857 --> 00:20:32,297
So, now you're flying around
  the world doing crazy stuff.
  HERJAVEC:
  okay, and then what happened?

00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:33,834
Well, while I was flying
  around the world,

00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:36,406
we had every fitness product
  and program in the world

00:20:36,406 --> 00:20:38,610
at our fingertips,
  and guess what we played.

00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,614
Pug?
  we played the pug game!

00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,253
I left, and I went
  to Harvard business school.

00:20:43,253 --> 00:20:44,522
And there --
  [ laughter ]

00:20:44,522 --> 00:20:45,924
HERJAVEC: Okay! Stop!

00:20:45,924 --> 00:20:48,196
All that training --
  you came up with cards?!

00:20:48,196 --> 00:20:49,432
Exactly!

00:20:49,432 --> 00:20:52,071
So, finish the story.

00:20:52,071 --> 00:20:53,673
So, I said,
  "why stop at push-ups?

00:20:53,673 --> 00:20:54,943
"why not take this pug concept

00:20:54,943 --> 00:20:56,914
and create a business
  out of it -- Fitdeck?"

00:20:56,914 --> 00:20:59,720
we can attack all things --
  not just body-weight exercises,

00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,726
but yoga, pilates, stretching,
  crossfit, basketball.

00:21:02,726 --> 00:21:03,995
HERJAVEC:
  how old are you?!

00:21:03,995 --> 00:21:06,500
Are you like 58? How could
  you have time to do all that?

00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,103
I'm 43.
  most of this was done --

00:21:08,103 --> 00:21:10,809
I have four kids, too, so they
  keep me pretty busy, as well.

00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:12,813
[ laughs ]
  and a dog.

00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,817
Phil, it's, like,
  a heck of a story, but...

00:21:14,817 --> 00:21:16,587
Why cards?
  cards?!
  trading cards, you know?

00:21:16,587 --> 00:21:18,091
Why the cards?
  it just doesn't add up.

00:21:18,091 --> 00:21:20,295
I-i-i-it's a simple solution.

00:21:20,295 --> 00:21:22,065
You understand the idea
  of milking it now...

00:21:22,065 --> 00:21:24,002
Yes.
  if you've already got
  the infrastructure.

00:21:24,002 --> 00:21:25,371
I don't know
  how long this lasts,

00:21:25,371 --> 00:21:26,908
but you could probably pull a
  couple million bucks out of it.

00:21:26,908 --> 00:21:29,046
That's what I'm hoping to do,
  Kevin. That's why I'm here.

00:21:29,046 --> 00:21:31,117
CUBAN:
  Phil, it's interesting.

00:21:31,117 --> 00:21:33,655
Honestly, with your background,
  it's kind of a disconnect

00:21:33,655 --> 00:21:35,492
that you go from there
  to trading cards,

00:21:35,492 --> 00:21:37,129
but you've done
  a great job of it.

00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,732
To sell 4 million,
  that's amazing.

00:21:38,732 --> 00:21:41,170
What is a problem
  is you recognize

00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:43,207
you're gonna have to go
  into the mobile side of things.

00:21:43,207 --> 00:21:44,243
Yes.

00:21:44,243 --> 00:21:47,683
It is the most brutal business
  in the world.

00:21:47,683 --> 00:21:51,925
There are
  hundreds of thousands of apps,

00:21:51,925 --> 00:21:56,001
and probably hundreds
  of thousands minus 1,000

00:21:56,001 --> 00:21:57,670
have gone out of business.

00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:02,513
I just don't see that
  as being an equitable outcome.

00:22:02,513 --> 00:22:04,450
[ chuckles ] Right? I just
  don't see the future there.

00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,887
And so, for that reason,
  I'm out.

00:22:05,887 --> 00:22:09,628
Phil, you're an m.B.A.
  investment banker

00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:10,997
at Goldman Sachs.
  Yale/Harvard graduate.

00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:13,770
You've put a value on
  this business of $1.5 million.

00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:16,174
Come on! I mean, you know
  it's not worth $1.5 million now.

00:22:16,174 --> 00:22:18,479
It doesn't make enough money
  to value that.

00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:19,715
Well, I think it does.

00:22:19,715 --> 00:22:21,485
I think we have
  a great library of content,

00:22:21,485 --> 00:22:23,289
I get that, but you --
  40 different titles.

00:22:23,289 --> 00:22:24,525
We've got cash flow.

00:22:24,525 --> 00:22:26,195
We have a great name --
  Fitdeck, fitness deck.

00:22:26,195 --> 00:22:27,631
It's a great name.

00:22:27,631 --> 00:22:30,036
We have the story. We have
  authenticity. We have a brand.

00:22:30,036 --> 00:22:31,405
And you're a Navy Seal!

00:22:31,405 --> 00:22:33,076
Exactly!

00:22:33,076 --> 00:22:35,547
And lastly, if there's one thing
  that I think all of us share...

00:22:35,547 --> 00:22:37,684
What?
  ...We can fight.

00:22:37,684 --> 00:22:39,956
Robert,
  I know you can fight.

00:22:39,956 --> 00:22:41,626
Lori, I know you can fight.

00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:44,198
Kevin, I know you can fight.
  Daymond, I know can fight.

00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:46,168
Is anyone gonna argue
  that Mark Cuban can fight?

00:22:46,168 --> 00:22:49,208
Guess what --
  I can fight, too!
  yeah, but I fight for me.
  I can fight for me.

00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:50,611
I can fight for you!
  I ain't fighting for you.

00:22:50,611 --> 00:22:52,949
Someone wants to
  come after my business, Kevin,

00:22:52,949 --> 00:22:56,523
and take the food out of
  my kids' mouths, I will fight!
  whoa.

00:22:56,523 --> 00:22:59,028
Whoo!
  you guys want to join me?
  we'll all fight!

00:22:59,028 --> 00:23:00,130
Phil, do you --
  [ laughter ]

00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,333
Somebody
  pepper-spray this guy.

00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:03,237
Do you do this --
  do you do this full time?

00:23:03,237 --> 00:23:05,207
Yes. This is
  our primary source of income.

00:23:05,207 --> 00:23:07,145
Fitdeck must work.
  I've got four kids.

00:23:07,145 --> 00:23:08,915
JOHN: Phil, let me bring
  some clarity.
  okay.

00:23:08,915 --> 00:23:12,890
You know, Goldman Sachs,
  Harvard, Yale, a seal, Fitdeck.

00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,760
I'm so impressed,
  I probably want to do the
  deal just 'cause of you.

00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,430
I probably will get a financial
  advisor, a Professor,

00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,735
a bodyguard, and a trainer
  all at the same time.

00:23:18,735 --> 00:23:20,471
All right!
  [ laughter ]

00:23:20,471 --> 00:23:21,908
um, you know,
  it's amazing.

00:23:21,908 --> 00:23:23,678
But, you know, applications --
  it's the new gold rush.

00:23:23,678 --> 00:23:26,684
Everybody with a computer
  believes they have one.

00:23:26,684 --> 00:23:30,625
You know, the money you have to
  spend to keep this current,

00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:33,331
I just don't know if I can help
  you and I think it's worth it.

00:23:33,331 --> 00:23:34,867
You have a --

00:23:34,867 --> 00:23:36,103
I -- [ sighs ]

00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,176
I'm out.

00:23:39,176 --> 00:23:42,583
Phil, I'm with you
  on the cards.

00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:44,253
It's a pretty good idea.

00:23:48,061 --> 00:23:51,567
Where you and I digress

00:23:51,567 --> 00:23:53,806
is there's something wrong
  in the business.

00:23:53,806 --> 00:23:56,210
You're selling 700,000

00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:59,350
for a product where your margin
  is unbelievable,

00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:02,424
and you can't make money
  at it.

00:24:02,424 --> 00:24:05,496
Very impressive story.
  thank you for your service.

00:24:05,496 --> 00:24:06,598
But I'm out.

00:24:06,598 --> 00:24:08,769
You -- as a technology person,
  you know,

00:24:08,769 --> 00:24:11,542
the fact that we have
  500,000 decks out there,

00:24:11,542 --> 00:24:13,179
that we can move people over
  and migrate them --

00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:15,750
Phil, if you think
  they're gonna migrate,
  you're lying to yourself.

00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:18,823
You know, Phil,
  I think you're amazing.

00:24:18,823 --> 00:24:20,259
I love your passion.

00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:22,965
I like the simplicity
  of the card,

00:24:22,965 --> 00:24:25,670
because, sometimes,
  I think we get too device-y.

00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:29,912
But I think
  it's really difficult

00:24:29,912 --> 00:24:31,281
to compete
  in this market.

00:24:31,281 --> 00:24:33,520
When you go online,
  there's just so many

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,693
different offerings
  for exercises.

00:24:36,693 --> 00:24:39,164
For me, I don't think it's
  the right business to invest in.

00:24:39,164 --> 00:24:40,199
So I'm out.

00:24:40,199 --> 00:24:42,505
HERJAVEC:
  who's left?

00:24:42,505 --> 00:24:44,074
I think
  Mr. Wonderful is the last,

00:24:44,074 --> 00:24:45,811
and I got to tell you
  something, Phil.

00:24:45,811 --> 00:24:48,183
I've been sitting in the
  Shark Tank for many years now,

00:24:48,183 --> 00:24:49,552
listening
  to a lot of pitches,

00:24:49,552 --> 00:24:51,122
and I pretty well get it
  very quickly.

00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:52,291
I don't get you.

00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:56,699
Phil, your răšsumăš
  is very impressive --

00:24:56,699 --> 00:24:58,470
perhaps the best we've ever seen
  on "Shark Tank."

00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,572
I'm not kidding.

00:24:59,572 --> 00:25:02,177
It does not equate
  to a deck of cards.

00:25:02,177 --> 00:25:04,750
You are destined for
  much greater things than this.

00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,052
I'm giving you a free pass

00:25:06,052 --> 00:25:08,089
to come back through the doors
  with the next idea,

00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:10,862
and I think everybody else here
  would do the same.

00:25:10,862 --> 00:25:12,432
This is not it.
  I'm out.

00:25:12,432 --> 00:25:14,101
Phil, thanks.

00:25:14,101 --> 00:25:16,139
Thank you
  for your time, Phil.
  thank you.

00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:17,241
It's a pleasure
  to meet you.

00:25:17,241 --> 00:25:18,544
Thank you. Likewise.

00:25:18,544 --> 00:25:20,715
GREINER:
  nice to meet you.

00:25:20,715 --> 00:25:22,619
They weren't really
  buying into the vision

00:25:22,619 --> 00:25:23,921
and into the business,

00:25:23,921 --> 00:25:26,995
and as a Navy Seal, I've swum
  with real sharks before.

00:25:26,995 --> 00:25:28,798
And given the choice,
  I'd probably go back

00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:30,835
to the real sharks
  and stay away from those guys.

00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:41,758
NARRATOR: Next up
  is an entrepreneur with a pill

00:25:41,758 --> 00:25:44,296
that he feels everyone
  should have just in case.

00:25:50,676 --> 00:25:51,678
Hello, sharks.

00:25:51,678 --> 00:25:53,382
My name is Daryl Stevenett,

00:25:53,382 --> 00:25:55,452
and I've created a product
  called Life Caps.

00:25:55,452 --> 00:25:58,659
I'm here
  seeking a $200,000 investment

00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:01,631
in exchange
  for 30% of my company.

00:26:01,631 --> 00:26:03,602
Now, sharks,
  can I ask you a question?

00:26:03,602 --> 00:26:04,972
Do I look healthy?

00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:07,677
Do I look mentally alert?

00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:11,786
I haven't had any food
  for eight days.

00:26:11,786 --> 00:26:12,854
[ chuckles ]

00:26:12,854 --> 00:26:15,860
Life caps is
  a life-saving survival pill

00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,698
that you can take
  in times of emergency

00:26:17,698 --> 00:26:19,568
when food is not available.

00:26:19,568 --> 00:26:22,674
Life caps satisfies hunger.
  I am not hungry.

00:26:22,674 --> 00:26:26,649
Life caps provides nutrition.
  I am mentally alert.

00:26:26,649 --> 00:26:28,786
I got the idea a few years ago

00:26:28,786 --> 00:26:31,124
when I saw a story
  about coal miners

00:26:31,124 --> 00:26:34,064
that were trapped underground
  in Southern Utah.

00:26:34,064 --> 00:26:38,773
The rescue workers were drilling
  a 4-inch hole down 1,500 feet,

00:26:38,773 --> 00:26:41,378
trying to get food and water
  down to the miners.

00:26:41,378 --> 00:26:44,585
Then I thought, "why doesn't
  somebody come up with an idea

00:26:44,585 --> 00:26:47,124
like a pill that could
  sustain life in an emergency?"

00:26:47,124 --> 00:26:50,029
then I thought, "why not me?"
  I'm a musician.

00:26:51,398 --> 00:26:53,637
I knew nothing about
  formulating a food product,

00:26:53,637 --> 00:26:56,308
so I reached out to a friend
  of mine who had created

00:26:56,308 --> 00:26:58,346
some of the top-selling
  energy bars in America.

00:26:58,346 --> 00:27:01,185
And a few weeks later,
  Life Caps was born.

00:27:01,185 --> 00:27:04,659
Life caps is perfect
  for any emergency situation,

00:27:04,659 --> 00:27:07,999
such as earthquakes,
  tornados, hurricanes --

00:27:07,999 --> 00:27:09,769
even campers, hikers, Hunters.

00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:13,343
With your help, I feel we can
  get the word out to the masses

00:27:13,343 --> 00:27:16,049
about this amazing new product
  and help a lot of people

00:27:16,049 --> 00:27:18,187
become better prepared
  for the unexpected.

00:27:18,187 --> 00:27:19,189
Thank you.

00:27:19,189 --> 00:27:20,691
O'LEARY:
  Now, you didn't tell us

00:27:20,691 --> 00:27:22,830
how long the shelf life is
  of this pill.

00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,365
I have
  a five-year shelf life.

00:27:24,365 --> 00:27:26,303
You really haven't eaten
  in eight days -- nothing?

00:27:26,303 --> 00:27:27,305
Swear to God.

00:27:27,305 --> 00:27:28,608
Just water and the pill?

00:27:28,608 --> 00:27:30,444
This is nothing --
  I went 17 days,

00:27:30,444 --> 00:27:32,381
and they put me on a show
  in Salt Lake City.

00:27:32,381 --> 00:27:34,219
Four ladies were interviewing.
  they kept saying,

00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:35,722
"Oh, my gosh!
  you must have lost weight!"

00:27:35,722 --> 00:27:37,526
six, seven times.
  did you lose weight?

00:27:37,526 --> 00:27:39,028
First of all,
  this is not a diet pill.

00:27:39,028 --> 00:27:40,632
Yes, I've lost some weight.

00:27:40,632 --> 00:27:43,036
And I think if you lose a little
  weight to save your life,

00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,506
that's a small price to pay.

00:27:44,506 --> 00:27:46,577
But the point is, these women
  were looking to you

00:27:46,577 --> 00:27:48,915
and going,
  "hmm. diet aid." right?

00:27:48,915 --> 00:27:50,252
Well, I know
  they were thinking that,

00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:52,256
because there was
  a 10,000 viewership on the show.

00:27:52,256 --> 00:27:53,591
It was 98% women.

00:27:53,591 --> 00:27:55,495
And after I said that,
  we sold out.

00:27:55,495 --> 00:27:56,732
We did $30,000 in sales.

00:27:56,732 --> 00:27:58,635
HERJAVEC:
  did you have one every day?

00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:01,675
I take a pill for breakfast,
  one for lunch, one for dinner,

00:28:01,675 --> 00:28:04,146
and if I'm hungry at night,
  I'll take a snack.

00:28:04,146 --> 00:28:05,215
[ pops lips ]

00:28:05,215 --> 00:28:07,085
[ laughs ]
  Would you like to try it?

00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:08,254
Yes!

00:28:08,254 --> 00:28:10,191
Absolutely not. Could we see
  the packaging, though?

00:28:10,191 --> 00:28:11,160
Mark, "absolutely not"?

00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,430
Absolutely not!

00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,766
Okay. Here you go.

00:28:13,766 --> 00:28:15,202
Thank you.

00:28:15,202 --> 00:28:17,173
HERJAVEC:
  Daryl, how many calories
  are in each capsule?

00:28:17,173 --> 00:28:18,542
There's a little bit of sugar
  in each one,

00:28:18,542 --> 00:28:21,515
but the calories are not there
  so you can live on it.

00:28:21,515 --> 00:28:24,287
The calories are there
  to help drive the nutrients

00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:25,991
right into your bloodstream.

00:28:25,991 --> 00:28:28,329
All right.
  so, I read this bottle.
  mm-hmm.

00:28:28,329 --> 00:28:30,599
And, basically,
  everything in here

00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:33,807
is like what's in some
  of the vitamins that I take.

00:28:33,807 --> 00:28:36,011
Isn't this just a vitamin?

00:28:36,011 --> 00:28:38,182
There is a huge difference.

00:28:38,182 --> 00:28:39,485
You know
  when bears hibernate,

00:28:39,485 --> 00:28:41,088
they go seven months
  without food?

00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,925
How do they do that?
  Bears don't die.

00:28:42,925 --> 00:28:45,430
They buy Life Caps.
  [ laughter ]

00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:48,403
when your body gets pure
  nutrition but zero calories,

00:28:48,403 --> 00:28:49,972
it feels free
  to burn body fat.

00:28:49,972 --> 00:28:52,110
I'm surviving right now
  on my own body fat.

00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,446
That's how bears hibernate.

00:28:53,446 --> 00:28:55,283
We've created
  a metabolic trigger

00:28:55,283 --> 00:28:57,921
which allows the body to burn
  its own fat for stored energy.

00:28:57,921 --> 00:29:00,060
How much weight did you lose
  in that eight days?

00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,264
I burn a pound a day when I'm
  doing this, and nothing else.

00:29:02,264 --> 00:29:03,266
8 pounds?

00:29:03,266 --> 00:29:04,568
JOHN: Let me ask you
  something here.

00:29:04,568 --> 00:29:06,940
At the end of the day, you want
  a bunch of people to say,

00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:09,746
"I want to just not eat
  and take this instead."

00:29:09,746 --> 00:29:11,282
No, that's not
  what I'm going for at all.

00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:12,952
Well, how do I make money?
  well, then how do we
  make money? Yeah.

00:29:12,952 --> 00:29:14,523
Because I'm gonna buy
  one pack. I don't need to
  buy another for five years.

00:29:14,523 --> 00:29:15,725
CUBAN: You guys seriously
  are considering

00:29:15,725 --> 00:29:17,394
looking at making money
  from this nonsense?

00:29:17,394 --> 00:29:18,631
I want to know --

00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:19,966
I'm just -- I want to know
  what he's thinking.

00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,235
Daryl, are you
  selling this today?

00:29:21,235 --> 00:29:22,605
In five years,
  we've done $440,000.

00:29:22,605 --> 00:29:24,609
All you have to say --

00:29:24,609 --> 00:29:27,148
"Hey, I took it for eight days,
  lost a pound a day,"

00:29:27,148 --> 00:29:28,317
and everybody goes nuts.

00:29:28,317 --> 00:29:30,421
If this was real,

00:29:30,421 --> 00:29:32,759
you would be telling us about
  how you took it to doctors,

00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:33,962
how you've had studies done.

00:29:33,962 --> 00:29:35,665
I want to do
  a clinical study.

00:29:35,665 --> 00:29:37,635
I didn't have the money
  to do it.

00:29:37,635 --> 00:29:40,475
You have had
  $100,000 in sales.
  my doctor -- I went
  and got a checkup on my 13th --

00:29:40,475 --> 00:29:41,543
my doctor looked at it.

00:29:41,543 --> 00:29:42,913
You are so full of crap.

00:29:42,913 --> 00:29:45,318
You keep on going back
  to all this nonsense, right?

00:29:45,318 --> 00:29:46,721
Well, I haven't eaten
  for eight days.

00:29:46,721 --> 00:29:48,592
I have no crap in me --
  trust me.

00:29:48,592 --> 00:29:49,660
[ laughter ]

00:29:51,564 --> 00:29:53,067
Daryl,
  I want to buy you --

00:29:53,067 --> 00:29:55,104
but, Daryl,
  I have a big question.

00:29:55,104 --> 00:29:56,674
Is this FDA-approved?

00:29:56,674 --> 00:29:58,043
Of course not.
  no supplement company wants --

00:29:58,043 --> 00:30:00,047
the FDA does not approve dietary
  supplements -- only drugs.

00:30:00,047 --> 00:30:02,419
This is FDA 100% compliant.

00:30:02,419 --> 00:30:04,323
Yeah,
  because it's nothing!

00:30:04,323 --> 00:30:05,459
You are
  such a snake-oil salesperson.

00:30:05,459 --> 00:30:06,928
If you do nothing,
  it's FDA-compliant.

00:30:06,928 --> 00:30:08,632
Mark, I challenge you
  to go eight days without food!

00:30:08,632 --> 00:30:10,202
Daryl, Daryl, you knew

00:30:10,202 --> 00:30:12,339
that you'd run across
  a guy like mark.

00:30:12,339 --> 00:30:14,477
You had the sales.
  you had the money.

00:30:14,477 --> 00:30:16,749
Why didn't you get
  some clinical tests done?

00:30:16,749 --> 00:30:19,220
Well, I think
  maybe it's time to do it.

00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,692
I look at the last five years
  as a test market.

00:30:21,692 --> 00:30:23,763
O'LEARY:
  so, I'm gonna suspend belief
  for a second

00:30:23,763 --> 00:30:25,700
and forget about
  all the objections to this.

00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,303
My biggest problem with it

00:30:27,303 --> 00:30:29,006
is that I have to have
  a few of these

00:30:29,006 --> 00:30:31,545
sitting on the shelf
  in case the zombies come.

00:30:31,545 --> 00:30:32,781
[ laughs ]

00:30:32,781 --> 00:30:34,551
The trouble is,
  I'm not buying any more

00:30:34,551 --> 00:30:36,956
until the zombies come,
  so I just buy it once,

00:30:36,956 --> 00:30:39,895
sits on my shelf
  waiting for zombies.

00:30:39,895 --> 00:30:41,131
That's no good.

00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:43,169
That's the problem.
  how do I make money?

00:30:43,169 --> 00:30:45,173
That's the only problem?

00:30:45,173 --> 00:30:47,477
Let's say this works.
  why are we talking
  about this?!

00:30:47,477 --> 00:30:49,615
Look, I see why you came up
  with this angle.

00:30:49,615 --> 00:30:50,884
No one can contest it.

00:30:50,884 --> 00:30:54,458
If this truly worked,
  it'd be really, really easy

00:30:54,458 --> 00:30:56,262
to take it to doctors
  and do studies.

00:30:56,262 --> 00:30:58,432
But instead, you come here
  like a snake-oil salesperson

00:30:58,432 --> 00:31:00,704
knowing that you're gonna prey
  on everybody watching

00:31:00,704 --> 00:31:02,942
the minute you said
  you lose 1 pound per day

00:31:02,942 --> 00:31:04,144
when you take this.

00:31:04,144 --> 00:31:05,246
That's wrong.

00:31:05,246 --> 00:31:07,885
I'm out, as Kevin says,
  with prejudice.

00:31:07,885 --> 00:31:10,991
Mark, I agree.
  we backdoored the diet industry.

00:31:10,991 --> 00:31:12,295
Like I said, I'm a musician.

00:31:12,295 --> 00:31:13,797
I don't know
  all the ins and outs.

00:31:13,797 --> 00:31:16,369
What have you been doing
  for five years?!
  you know what, though?

00:31:16,369 --> 00:31:18,740
He's a hustler.
  I did a real-world study.

00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:21,413
GREINER:
  Whenever somebody is selling
  something that you ingest,

00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:24,820
you have to be
  a really responsible person

00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:28,593
and make sure that what
  you're giving everybody is safe.

00:31:28,593 --> 00:31:30,999
Doing the clinical trials
  and the studies

00:31:30,999 --> 00:31:34,439
and all of that beforehand
  is really important.

00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:35,942
You haven't done that.

00:31:35,942 --> 00:31:37,713
I'm out.

00:31:37,713 --> 00:31:39,950
Barbara,
  can I explain one thing?

00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,754
I'm not Barbara.
  oh, excuse me -- Lori.

00:31:41,754 --> 00:31:43,524
[ laughter ]

00:31:43,524 --> 00:31:45,895
That mental thing
  is not holding up.

00:31:45,895 --> 00:31:46,964
Whoops. Yeah.

00:31:46,964 --> 00:31:48,568
That mental thing
  is not holding up.

00:31:48,568 --> 00:31:50,238
HERJAVEC:
  you know, the problem is,
  people want a shortcut.

00:31:50,238 --> 00:31:52,609
People don't want
  to put the discipline in

00:31:52,609 --> 00:31:55,382
it takes to eat healthy
  and lose weight and so on.

00:31:55,382 --> 00:31:59,289
So, a guy like you comes along,
  and people see a shortcut.

00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:00,893
And they don't look
  behind the facade.

00:32:00,893 --> 00:32:02,964
I think
  it's irresponsible.

00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:04,634
I'm out.

00:32:06,638 --> 00:32:09,878
You know, the presentation
  started off like steak.

00:32:09,878 --> 00:32:11,380
It started to look like
  filet mignon.

00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,317
But, as the other sharks
  pointed out,

00:32:13,317 --> 00:32:17,627
no FDA approval, no research,
  no clinical trials.

00:32:17,627 --> 00:32:18,962
The filet mignon,
  the steak,

00:32:18,962 --> 00:32:20,633
just became
  a rotten pack of baloney.

00:32:22,102 --> 00:32:23,472
I'm out.

00:32:25,075 --> 00:32:27,513
CUBAN:
  And then there was one.

00:32:27,513 --> 00:32:30,186
I'm just a guy
  trying to scratch out a living.

00:32:30,186 --> 00:32:34,829
I ask myself, can I make
  any money investing in this?

00:32:34,829 --> 00:32:36,498
And the answer is no.

00:32:36,498 --> 00:32:37,667
I'm out.

00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:41,441
STEVENETT:
  I really appreciate all of you,

00:32:41,441 --> 00:32:43,178
and I appreciate
  what you're doing for people.

00:32:43,178 --> 00:32:46,117
You're putting people to work,
  helping entrepreneurs.

00:32:46,117 --> 00:32:47,654
It's an honor to meet you all.
  thank you.

00:32:47,654 --> 00:32:48,556
Thank you.
  thank you.

00:32:51,529 --> 00:32:53,700
CUBAN: He's such
  a snake-oil salesperson.

00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,737
He's gonna go anywhere
  that there's an audience

00:32:55,737 --> 00:32:57,174
and hope
  that somebody says yes.

00:32:57,174 --> 00:32:59,111
I get slimy
  just thinking about him. Next!

00:33:06,792 --> 00:33:09,765
NARRATOR: Next into the tank
  is a mom from Provo, Utah,

00:33:09,765 --> 00:33:14,575
with a stylish and functional
  way to cover tiny feet.

00:33:17,782 --> 00:33:20,153
Hi. My name
  is Susan Petersen.

00:33:20,153 --> 00:33:22,992
The name of my company
  is Freshly Picked.

00:33:22,992 --> 00:33:26,433
And I'm asking for $150,000
  for 10%.

00:33:26,433 --> 00:33:29,673
Freshly picked is
  the world's best baby moccasin.

00:33:29,673 --> 00:33:31,476
When my second child, Gus,
  was born,

00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:33,514
I looked everywhere
  for this type of shoe.

00:33:33,514 --> 00:33:34,950
Soft soles are
  actually better for babies

00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,086
that are learning to walk

00:33:36,086 --> 00:33:37,990
because they can flex their toes
  with every step,

00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,125
and this promotes balance.

00:33:39,125 --> 00:33:41,263
I couldn't find the shoe
  that I was looking for,

00:33:41,263 --> 00:33:43,969
so I decided to try my hand
  at making one.

00:33:43,969 --> 00:33:45,304
I had a bag of scrap leather

00:33:45,304 --> 00:33:47,075
that I'd gotten
  from a garage sale,

00:33:47,075 --> 00:33:48,577
and I taught myself how to sew.

00:33:51,216 --> 00:33:53,120
I worked through
  six different designs

00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,091
until I landed on one
  that fit the bill.

00:33:55,091 --> 00:33:58,197
Let me show you
  how amazing my moccasins are.

00:34:01,904 --> 00:34:04,510
These are gonna remind you
  of your days on the track.

00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,314
GREINER: Adorable.

00:34:06,314 --> 00:34:07,816
Stay golden.

00:34:07,816 --> 00:34:09,620
Oh, thank you.
  they're so cute.

00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,758
Thank you.
  'cause I like your heart.

00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,094
And for your team.

00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:16,234
HERJAVEC:
  they're beautiful.

00:34:16,234 --> 00:34:17,770
Yeah, really cute.

00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:18,906
Where do you make these?

00:34:18,906 --> 00:34:21,177
I started out making these
  all by myself.

00:34:21,177 --> 00:34:24,651
Two years ago, I hired
  a local girl to help me,

00:34:24,651 --> 00:34:27,056
and then we also get them made
  in California, as well.

00:34:27,056 --> 00:34:28,659
HERJAVEC: Susan,
  how do you sell them today?

00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:29,995
Strictly through
  our e-commerce site.

00:34:29,995 --> 00:34:31,765
And what are
  your sales?

00:34:31,765 --> 00:34:33,001
$500,000.

00:34:33,001 --> 00:34:34,303
$500,000?!

00:34:34,303 --> 00:34:36,308
That's a big number.
  this year.

00:34:36,308 --> 00:34:37,977
GREINER: Wow!
  wow!
  O'LEARY: This year?

00:34:37,977 --> 00:34:39,113
Good for you.

00:34:39,113 --> 00:34:40,450
Susan, what's your profit
  on the $500,000?

00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:42,520
$120,000.

00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,226
How many pairs is the most
  active buyer buying from you?

00:34:45,226 --> 00:34:46,562
Okay,
  that's a good question.

00:34:46,562 --> 00:34:47,697
$500,000?!

00:34:47,697 --> 00:34:49,000
All my questions are good,
  Susan.

00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,038
That's why they call me
  "Mr. Wonderful."

00:34:51,038 --> 00:34:52,807
Kevin, your face
  is on my pillow at night.

00:34:52,807 --> 00:34:53,776
I've gone to bed --
  yeah!

00:34:53,776 --> 00:34:54,979
I love you.
  whoa!

00:34:54,979 --> 00:34:57,417
Keep it up,
  I'll drop the royalty rate.

00:34:57,417 --> 00:34:59,020
All right.
  answer that question, please.

00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,490
PETERSEN: Okay, wait.

00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:02,427
So, out of all of our customers
  that have made one purchase,

00:35:02,427 --> 00:35:04,164
50% of them have come back

00:35:04,164 --> 00:35:05,634
and bought
  at least three more times.

00:35:05,634 --> 00:35:07,103
That's very impressive.

00:35:07,103 --> 00:35:08,440
Can a baby easily
  just pull it off?

00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,575
No. That's the thing.

00:35:09,575 --> 00:35:11,746
The elastic keeps it
  around their ankle.

00:35:11,746 --> 00:35:14,352
So, Susan,
  $500,000 in sales.

00:35:14,352 --> 00:35:15,654
Tell me how much money

00:35:15,654 --> 00:35:17,491
you've put into the company
  when you started.

00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:19,896
So, when I first started,
  I didn't have any money.

00:35:19,896 --> 00:35:22,601
My husband was in school,
  and we were really, really poor.

00:35:22,601 --> 00:35:25,240
My brother owns
  a window-installation business,

00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,578
and so I convinced him
  one summer

00:35:27,578 --> 00:35:30,184
to give me all the old windows
  he took out.

00:35:30,184 --> 00:35:32,722
And I spent the whole summer
  out there during that time

00:35:32,722 --> 00:35:35,260
in the heat banging the glass
  out of those windows,

00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,730
'cause they're aluminum-frame.

00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:38,433
I took those frames
  to the scrapyard

00:35:38,433 --> 00:35:40,370
at the end of the summer,
  and I got $200.

00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:42,308
And I was able to buy
  one hide of leather,

00:35:42,308 --> 00:35:44,011
which makes
  about 40 moccasins.

00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:45,214
That's really great.

00:35:45,214 --> 00:35:47,184
And then I just continually
  put it back in.

00:35:47,184 --> 00:35:49,188
And that's why we had
  kind of a slow start.

00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,725
That literally
  is the best story

00:35:50,725 --> 00:35:51,861
to start a company
  I've ever heard.

00:35:51,861 --> 00:35:52,929
How much
  do these sell for?

00:35:52,929 --> 00:35:54,399
I don't think
  we got a price point.

00:35:54,399 --> 00:35:55,668
$60 retail.
  $60 a pair?

00:35:55,668 --> 00:35:57,038
60 bucks?
  uh-huh.

00:35:57,038 --> 00:35:59,042
And what do you
  make them for?

00:35:59,042 --> 00:36:01,480
We're at about $17,
  'cause we're still domestic.

00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,950
What's the projection
  for next year?

00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:05,555
I think with
  just my social media alone,

00:36:05,555 --> 00:36:07,894
I can do
  between $2- and $3 million.

00:36:07,894 --> 00:36:09,664
That's a lot
  of baby shoes.

00:36:09,664 --> 00:36:13,137
I am gaining about 1,500 new
  followers on Instagram a week,

00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:16,478
and we've found that
  about 10% of our Instagram buy.

00:36:16,478 --> 00:36:18,649
And do you have retailers
  that are customers?

00:36:18,649 --> 00:36:19,884
Any brick and mortar?

00:36:19,884 --> 00:36:21,855
We have a lot of retailers
  that are interested,

00:36:21,855 --> 00:36:23,224
but I can't keep up
  with the demand.

00:36:23,224 --> 00:36:26,331
I need the money
  to make a big order overseas.

00:36:26,331 --> 00:36:28,502
This next year,
  my vision for the company

00:36:28,502 --> 00:36:29,871
is to start
  moving into retail.

00:36:29,871 --> 00:36:32,143
I'm just wondering --
  how in love with retail are you?

00:36:32,143 --> 00:36:36,418
Because it's a very tough
  business on the inventory side.

00:36:36,418 --> 00:36:37,854
I really -- I want to --

00:36:37,854 --> 00:36:40,927
I want to build
  a big, big, big company.

00:36:40,927 --> 00:36:43,632
But you want to make money.
  you're right.

00:36:43,632 --> 00:36:46,706
Retail's like a siren
  on an ancient ship,

00:36:46,706 --> 00:36:49,611
drawing the sailors towards her
  and then drowning them.

00:36:49,611 --> 00:36:51,414
That's what happens.
  it's true.

00:36:51,414 --> 00:36:53,085
And I've seen it happen
  many, many times.

00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,555
They take your capital.

00:36:54,555 --> 00:36:56,792
They put your product
  in the store.

00:36:56,792 --> 00:36:59,732
  they get paid, plus 30 days.

00:36:59,732 --> 00:37:02,471
Susan, let me just say --
  your story

00:37:02,471 --> 00:37:05,543
of taking the windows
  and pulling out the aluminum

00:37:05,543 --> 00:37:07,447
should be
  in every business book,

00:37:07,447 --> 00:37:09,685
should be
  in every entrepreneur's guide.

00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:12,824
You personify
  the American dream

00:37:12,824 --> 00:37:14,796
of saying,
  "get off my butt,

00:37:14,796 --> 00:37:16,499
and let's go out there
  and get it done."

00:37:16,499 --> 00:37:17,935
thank you, mark.

00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:19,672
Now, that said, right,

00:37:19,672 --> 00:37:22,110
I'm not the guy
  for the baby-shoes world.

00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:25,316
I'd be learning from you more
  than you'd be learning from me.

00:37:25,316 --> 00:37:28,857
I can't respect you enough,
  but I have to say I'm out.

00:37:30,293 --> 00:37:31,128
Okay.

00:37:32,432 --> 00:37:35,304
So, Susan, like mark said,
  very impressive.

00:37:35,304 --> 00:37:37,308
I have a saying
  that I always tell people --

00:37:37,308 --> 00:37:38,977
"sales trumps all."

00:37:38,977 --> 00:37:40,114
I mean, wow!

00:37:40,114 --> 00:37:42,251
$500,000 --
  you got it going on.

00:37:42,251 --> 00:37:46,159
I just -- I can't add anything
  to the baby-shoe business.

00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:48,865
I don't think
  I'm the right partner for you.

00:37:48,865 --> 00:37:49,934
I'm out.

00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:53,373
You have what it takes

00:37:53,373 --> 00:37:56,981
to make a great business
  and to run your business.

00:37:56,981 --> 00:38:00,387
I actually think that
  you'll be better on your own.

00:38:00,387 --> 00:38:03,561
So, for that reason,
  I'm out.

00:38:05,197 --> 00:38:08,137
How many pairs do you think
  you're gonna sell in a year?

00:38:08,137 --> 00:38:09,773
Next year?
  yeah.

00:38:09,773 --> 00:38:12,312
Between 25,000 to 30,000.

00:38:12,312 --> 00:38:14,617
So, if you feel
  you're gonna do that --

00:38:14,617 --> 00:38:17,589
which is more than awesome,
  it's amazing --

00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:21,831
why do you feel
  you need the $150,000?

00:38:21,831 --> 00:38:24,036
Why take on a partner?

00:38:24,036 --> 00:38:27,075
Well,
  I haven't been to school.

00:38:27,075 --> 00:38:28,746
This is my first business,

00:38:28,746 --> 00:38:30,615
and I have been burned
  a couple times.

00:38:30,615 --> 00:38:33,556
And I really --
  I -- I love advice.

00:38:33,556 --> 00:38:35,526
No one ever
  has to do the work for me.

00:38:35,526 --> 00:38:37,229
As shown, I will do it.

00:38:37,229 --> 00:38:39,935
But I need help
  with manufacturing.

00:38:39,935 --> 00:38:41,204
That's a big one for me.

00:38:41,204 --> 00:38:43,576
I don't want
  10% of a company.

00:38:43,576 --> 00:38:45,780
That's just -- it doesn't
  get me up in the morning.

00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,584
I mean,
  that's just not enough

00:38:47,584 --> 00:38:49,387
for all the headaches
  you're gonna be.

00:38:49,387 --> 00:38:51,625
I -- I am not a headache.

00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:53,896
Business is always
  full of headaches. Trust me.

00:38:53,896 --> 00:38:56,835
But you have
  high margins.

00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:59,976
So, I'm gonna set up
  a rather crafty way of doing it.

00:38:59,976 --> 00:39:01,946
You have to get $150,000,

00:39:01,946 --> 00:39:04,417
and in this deal,

00:39:04,417 --> 00:39:06,756
I need this guy
  more than he needs me.

00:39:06,756 --> 00:39:08,693
But I bring a lot
  to the table

00:39:08,693 --> 00:39:11,064
in terms of making you
  bigger than you are.

00:39:11,064 --> 00:39:13,002
I'll give you $75,000,

00:39:13,002 --> 00:39:16,074
and the way I would structure it
  is -- no equity.

00:39:16,074 --> 00:39:17,176
Don't want any.

00:39:17,176 --> 00:39:19,515
I want a royalty.

00:39:19,515 --> 00:39:22,020
I'd like to do a royalty
  of 7%

00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,425
until my $75,000 comes back,

00:39:24,425 --> 00:39:26,028
and then drop it down to 5%.

00:39:26,028 --> 00:39:27,498
And you can well afford that,
  actually.

00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:29,035
You have to give her
  $150,000, kev.

00:39:29,035 --> 00:39:30,771
No, but I only have $75,000,
  unfortunately.

00:39:30,771 --> 00:39:32,374
I wonder
  if anybody else has $75,000.

00:39:32,374 --> 00:39:35,147
So, that means, Daymond,
  you have to give her $75,000.

00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:46,470
NARRATOR:
  three sharks are out.

00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:48,607
Susan has a partial offer
  from Kevin

00:39:48,607 --> 00:39:52,081
but needs Daymond
  to join in on the offer.

00:39:52,081 --> 00:39:55,688
Susan, I say I give you
  the $150,000 for 25%

00:39:55,688 --> 00:39:57,359
and we tell this bozo
  to take a walk.

00:39:58,394 --> 00:40:00,631
Ooh.

00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:03,938
25%.
  wow. That's expensive.

00:40:03,938 --> 00:40:05,708
I'm 25% of a partnership
  with you,

00:40:05,708 --> 00:40:07,812
and I'll help you
  with everything.

00:40:07,812 --> 00:40:09,616
That's a lot of equity.

00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:11,186
This is a real debate
  for you, now.

00:40:11,186 --> 00:40:12,489
It really is.
  no, it's not.

00:40:12,489 --> 00:40:15,428
Kevin, I really thank you
  for your offer, but I think

00:40:15,428 --> 00:40:17,532
at this point in my business,
  where I want to grow to,

00:40:17,532 --> 00:40:20,171
I don't think it's smart
  for me to give you 7%.

00:40:20,171 --> 00:40:22,409
What would you give me
  if I kept my equity at zero?

00:40:22,409 --> 00:40:24,346
Tell him to take a walk
  and let's do this.

00:40:24,346 --> 00:40:26,016
I would give you a kiss.

00:40:26,016 --> 00:40:27,987
Ohh!
  yeah!
  what?!

00:40:27,987 --> 00:40:29,490
That -- that is cheap.
  that's cheap.
  that's what's in it for me --
  a kiss?

00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:31,694
Tell him to take a walk.
  why are you not dealing
  with Daymond?

00:40:31,694 --> 00:40:34,267
Susan, why are you
  not dealing with Daymond?

00:40:34,267 --> 00:40:36,304
I -- I -- I was gonna --
  I -- Daymond.

00:40:36,304 --> 00:40:38,408
I -- you're actually --
  you're my dream shark.

00:40:38,408 --> 00:40:41,247
Will you do $150,000
  for 20%?

00:40:41,247 --> 00:40:43,385
I'm gonna give you
  the respect of who you are

00:40:43,385 --> 00:40:45,924
because of what you've done
  and what you've accomplished.

00:40:45,924 --> 00:40:49,998
I normally would want 1/3.

00:40:51,468 --> 00:40:54,240
I would like to stay
  at 25%.

00:40:55,710 --> 00:41:00,887
So, $150,000 for 25%
  values my company at $600,000,

00:41:00,887 --> 00:41:04,695
which is almost
  what I've done this year.

00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:07,434
I think next month,
  I'll hit that mark.

00:41:07,434 --> 00:41:10,773
But you're
  my dream investor.

00:41:10,773 --> 00:41:12,511
It's six times your profits.
  it's six times your profit.

00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:15,517
It's not -- it's not what
  I'm valuing your company at.

00:41:15,517 --> 00:41:18,155
Yeah.
  it's what
  I'm valuing my time at.

00:41:18,155 --> 00:41:20,093
'cause when you put in
  the valuation,

00:41:20,093 --> 00:41:22,030
if we were
  just purely doing valuation,

00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:24,268
that means
  I just write you $150,000

00:41:24,268 --> 00:41:26,907
and I look in my mailbox every
  quarter and I don't help you.

00:41:26,907 --> 00:41:28,376
Susan,
  one thing, though.
  yes.

00:41:28,376 --> 00:41:30,981
When you sell the company
  one day for $100 million,

00:41:30,981 --> 00:41:32,790
you're gonna cry
  on my pillow

00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,725
for the $25 million
  you're gonna give him.

00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:37,128
Kevin, I love you,
  but I don't think

00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:39,463
I can give away
  any percentage of my profit.

00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:43,434
Susan, $150,000, 25%
  from Daymond.

00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:45,136
You got to make
  a decision.

00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:52,176
When I go to New York next time,
  can I come see your office?

00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:55,346
You will have a space
  in my office.

00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,714
How about that?
  we have a deal.

00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:57,648
Yay!

00:41:57,648 --> 00:41:59,350
All right.

00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,586
I love it.
  you are a tough cookie.
  GREINER:
  Nice deal. Congrats, Susan.

00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:03,521
I'm so excited
  to work with you!

00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,222
Thank you for letting me be
  a part of your dream.

00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:06,257
This is amazing.
  thank you.

00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:07,325
Congrats.

00:42:07,325 --> 00:42:08,359
Great job, Susan.

00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,493
Thank you.

00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:11,929
Great deal.

00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:13,698
All right.
  I liked that one.

00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:14,398
Good job.

00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,301
PETERSEN: I'm really excited
  to work with Daymond

00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:19,604
because he knows manufacturing,
  he knows retail.

00:42:19,604 --> 00:42:22,173
He's just
  the perfect combination for me.

00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:24,442
It's gonna be
  a beautiful marriage.
