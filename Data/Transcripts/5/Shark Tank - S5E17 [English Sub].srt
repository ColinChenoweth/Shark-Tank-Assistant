00:00:02,236 --> 00:00:06,405
NARRATOR:
This is the Shark Tank...

00:00:06,405 --> 00:00:08,608
Where hopeful entrepreneurs

00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:11,477
get a once-in-a-lifetime chance
to pitch the sharks

00:00:11,477 --> 00:00:13,446
in hopes
of getting an investment

00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:16,214
to start, grow,
or save their businesses.

00:00:16,214 --> 00:00:18,116
I am a former C.I.A. officer,

00:00:18,116 --> 00:00:19,684
and if I had to
tell you any more,
I'd have to kill you.

00:00:19,684 --> 00:00:21,286
Tell him more!

00:00:21,286 --> 00:00:23,121
NARRATOR: The entrepreneurs
must convince a shark

00:00:23,121 --> 00:00:25,624
to invest the full amount
they're asking for...

00:00:25,624 --> 00:00:27,057
Oh, damn.
Whoa. [groans]

00:00:27,057 --> 00:00:28,692
...or they'll walk away
with nothing.

00:00:28,692 --> 00:00:30,394
My mom had me
at 16 years old.

00:00:30,394 --> 00:00:32,029
I'm a first-generation
college student.

00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:34,231
Have a heart, Barbara.
Come on.
I have the right to be here.

00:00:34,231 --> 00:00:36,600
I've worked so hard.
CUBAN, JOHN, AND HERJAVEC:
Barbara! Barbara!
Barbara! Barbara!

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,601
Come on, Barbara!

00:00:38,601 --> 00:00:39,836
NARRATOR: If the sharks hear
a great idea...

00:00:39,836 --> 00:00:41,538
I couldn't do anything
on my own.

00:00:41,538 --> 00:00:43,473
My wife had to dress me
in the morning.

00:00:43,473 --> 00:00:46,743
I'm former WWE world champion
diamond Dallas Page,

00:00:46,743 --> 00:00:48,243
and today,
we just broke $3 million.

00:00:48,243 --> 00:00:49,678
Dang.

00:00:49,678 --> 00:00:51,947
NARRATOR:
They're ready to invest
using their own money...

00:00:51,947 --> 00:00:53,982
I'll make you
a $100,000 offer

00:00:53,982 --> 00:00:56,685
for 40%.
You thief!

00:00:56,685 --> 00:00:58,086
NARRATOR: ...And they're willing
to fight each other

00:00:58,086 --> 00:00:59,587
for a piece of the action.

00:00:59,587 --> 00:01:02,657
I want a dollar a unit.
That doesn't make
any sense.

00:01:02,657 --> 00:01:04,559
If you want to make
an offer, Robert,
go ahead and make one.

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,428
You are so lucky you've met me.
You have no idea.

00:01:09,496 --> 00:01:10,864
NARRATOR:
Who are the sharks?

00:01:12,365 --> 00:01:15,435
They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors

00:01:15,435 --> 00:01:17,938
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.

00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:20,606
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist

00:01:20,606 --> 00:01:22,608
who turned a $10,000 loan

00:01:22,608 --> 00:01:26,946
into a software business
worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,783
Barbara Corcoran went
from waiting tables in Manhattan

00:01:31,783 --> 00:01:35,587
to building the city's
preeminent real-estate empire.

00:01:35,587 --> 00:01:38,022
Daymond John is
a fashion and branding expert

00:01:38,022 --> 00:01:40,058
who grew
his homemade clothing line

00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:43,260
into the globally recognized
fashion brand fubu,

00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,630
with over $6 billion
in retail sales to date.

00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,833
Robert Herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,

00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,835
is now a technology mogul

00:01:51,835 --> 00:01:56,205
who sold his first internet
companies for over $350 million.

00:01:57,139 --> 00:01:58,741
And Mark Cuban,

00:01:58,741 --> 00:02:02,011
notorious billionaire
entrepreneur, tech guru,

00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:17,057
and the outspoken owner
of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.

00:02:17,057 --> 00:02:18,425
My name is Ryan Carpenter.

00:02:18,425 --> 00:02:21,095
I live in Portland, Oregon,
with my turtle, Mo,

00:02:21,095 --> 00:02:23,030
and I'm the owner of Moberi.

00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:25,431
I love living in Portland.

00:02:25,431 --> 00:02:28,001
Portland is the place
where weird ideas thrive,

00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:30,837
and what I do is definitely
a little weird,

00:02:30,837 --> 00:02:32,171
and people
really like that here.

00:02:32,171 --> 00:02:33,506
Leading a healthy lifestyle

00:02:33,506 --> 00:02:35,507
is something I've done
for a long time.

00:02:35,507 --> 00:02:37,809
I frequently ride my bike around
to the farmers market,

00:02:37,809 --> 00:02:38,877
picking up fresh produce.

00:02:38,877 --> 00:02:40,012
Can't wait to juice these.

00:02:40,012 --> 00:02:41,413
They're gonna go great
in the smoothies.

00:02:41,413 --> 00:02:42,581
Yeah, totally.
Yeah.

00:02:42,581 --> 00:02:45,183
My goal was to start a business
with $500.

00:02:45,183 --> 00:02:47,752
Then, I found a new way
to use old bikes,

00:02:47,752 --> 00:02:51,022
and I found a way to mix
my healthy and active lifestyle

00:02:51,022 --> 00:02:52,657
and share it with the world.

00:02:52,657 --> 00:02:56,693
Standing out in Portland
is not an easy thing to do,

00:02:56,693 --> 00:02:58,795
but I've created a product
that turns heads

00:02:58,795 --> 00:03:00,296
and gets people excited.

00:03:00,296 --> 00:03:02,966
I've put all my savings and
then some into this business,

00:03:02,966 --> 00:03:05,101
but for me,
it's not just about the money.

00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,736
It's about the chance
to do something

00:03:06,736 --> 00:03:08,404
that I really like doing
for a living.

00:03:08,404 --> 00:03:10,706
My dream for this business
goes so much farther

00:03:10,706 --> 00:03:12,441
than my resources can take it.

00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:14,276
With an investment
from the sharks,

00:03:14,276 --> 00:03:16,712
I can take it to the next level
and make Mo proud.

00:03:32,225 --> 00:03:33,760
Hey, sharks.

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,462
My name is Ryan Carpenter,

00:03:35,462 --> 00:03:39,198
my business is Moberi,
and I'm looking for $50,000

00:03:39,198 --> 00:03:42,201
in exchange
for a 15% stake in my company.

00:03:43,836 --> 00:03:45,404
Welcome to Moberi,

00:03:45,404 --> 00:03:48,007
the first bicycle-powered
smoothie-and-juice cart,

00:03:48,007 --> 00:03:49,241
from Portland, Oregon.

00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:52,577
Food trucks, bicycles,
and healthy juice bars

00:03:52,577 --> 00:03:55,947
are major trends
sweeping the nation right now,

00:03:55,947 --> 00:03:57,882
and we combine all three

00:03:57,882 --> 00:04:01,151
into an interactive experience
unlike any other.

00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:03,587
Using fresh greens,
fruits, and superfoods,

00:04:03,587 --> 00:04:06,657
customers come to us to
pedal-power their own smoothies,

00:04:06,657 --> 00:04:08,292
or we do it for them.

00:04:08,292 --> 00:04:11,461
[laughter]
Either way, the experience
is always fun,

00:04:11,461 --> 00:04:13,763
And the product is delicious.

00:04:13,763 --> 00:04:15,598
And with a little bit
of your guys' help,

00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:19,135
we can take this pedal-powered
concept to a whole new level.

00:04:19,135 --> 00:04:20,603
But before
we get down to business,

00:04:20,603 --> 00:04:22,904
who wants to come up
and pedal their own smoothie?

00:04:22,904 --> 00:04:24,206
Me!

00:04:24,206 --> 00:04:25,907
Daymond? All right.
Come on up.

00:04:25,907 --> 00:04:27,309
[chuckles]
I want a piece of this.
Mark.

00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:28,677
All right.

00:04:28,677 --> 00:04:30,545
Daymond,
why don't you hop on that one?

00:04:30,545 --> 00:04:31,747
See if that works for you.

00:04:31,747 --> 00:04:33,080
Oh, that's funny.
HERJAVEC: Oh, wow.

00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,182
My, oh, my.
JOHN: Oh, my goodness.

00:04:35,182 --> 00:04:37,218
This is pretty funny.

00:04:37,218 --> 00:04:38,519
Go, Daymond! Go, Daymond!

00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:40,254
CARPENTER: Hold on.
All right, guys.

00:04:40,254 --> 00:04:41,789
The trick is to start slow

00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:44,157
and then pick up the speed
as we get going.

00:04:44,157 --> 00:04:46,626
[laughs]

00:04:46,626 --> 00:04:48,094
Nice. I like this.

00:04:48,094 --> 00:04:49,662
It's pretty smooth, right?
Yeah.

00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:52,599
Five, four, three, two, one!
HERJAVEC: Mark, go faster!

00:04:52,599 --> 00:04:53,666
That's it.
Power, not speed.

00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:54,933
Nice job, guys.

00:04:54,933 --> 00:04:56,401
That's cool.
Sweet.

00:04:56,401 --> 00:04:57,469
Did it work?
All right.

00:04:57,469 --> 00:04:58,871
There you go.
[laughs]

00:04:58,871 --> 00:05:00,405
That's all yours.
There you go.

00:05:00,405 --> 00:05:01,874
It's good.
[laughs]

00:05:01,874 --> 00:05:03,041
That is really good.

00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,176
Is it good? Nice.
That is really good.

00:05:04,176 --> 00:05:05,743
JOHN: Wow.
That is good.

00:05:05,743 --> 00:05:06,844
This is good.

00:05:06,844 --> 00:05:10,014
All right. Robert?
Take one of each, here.

00:05:10,014 --> 00:05:13,117
The green one here
is the Johnny Utah.

00:05:13,117 --> 00:05:16,219
That's got kale,
pineapple, and mint.

00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:17,420
HERJAVEC: Wow.

00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,421
Thank you.
You're welcome.

00:05:18,421 --> 00:05:20,223
This thing's amazing.

00:05:20,223 --> 00:05:22,392
Wow. The green is great.
Yummy.

00:05:24,227 --> 00:05:25,262
All right.

00:05:25,262 --> 00:05:27,129
Okay, Ryan.
Quick question.

00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:28,531
Sure.
Are you nuts?

00:05:28,531 --> 00:05:30,132
[laughs] Uh...

00:05:30,132 --> 00:05:31,867
O'LEARY: Think about
the capacity constraint.

00:05:31,867 --> 00:05:34,603
Get five guys walking up there
to buy their smoothie,

00:05:34,603 --> 00:05:36,438
and they all
have to ride a bicycle?

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,744
So, we have one bicycle
inside our current cart,

00:05:42,744 --> 00:05:46,014
and we have one bike outside
on our food-cart patio.

00:05:46,014 --> 00:05:47,282
CORCORAN: And how would
you even come up

00:05:47,282 --> 00:05:49,917
with this
really ridiculous idea?

00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:51,218
Ridiculously great idea?

00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,255
I saw
how a Guatemalan nonprofit

00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:56,723
was turning bicycles

00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:59,725
into washing machines
and concrete mixers,

00:05:59,725 --> 00:06:01,327
and I thought
smoothies would go over

00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:03,162
a little bit better
in the Portland market.

00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:05,164
What are sales, say?
What have you got for numbers?

00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:08,634
So, so far this year,
we've sold $70,000.

00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:09,901
We'll be at $100,000
by the end of the year.

00:06:09,901 --> 00:06:11,837
Do you have
a single location?

00:06:11,837 --> 00:06:13,271
I have
one full-time location,

00:06:13,271 --> 00:06:15,907
and I have a mobile cart
that I use for catering.

00:06:15,907 --> 00:06:17,242
So, tell me
about the one location.

00:06:17,242 --> 00:06:19,077
It's an 8x16 trailer.

00:06:19,077 --> 00:06:21,245
I'd say
about 80% of my customers

00:06:21,245 --> 00:06:22,713
let us do the pedaling.

00:06:22,713 --> 00:06:24,181
What do you charge
for a smoothie?

00:06:24,181 --> 00:06:25,649
So, the average
is 6 bucks.

00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:28,552
And why do you think
this is gonna become popular,

00:06:28,552 --> 00:06:30,054
with all the other
competitions you have --

00:06:30,054 --> 00:06:31,588
the jamba juices
and everybody in the world?

00:06:31,588 --> 00:06:34,290
Because it's -- it's different.
It's interactive. It's fun.

00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,626
But, Ryan, after I do it once,
do I care?

00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:37,760
Yeah. You do.

00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,796
Nobody comes into our spot
in a bad mood

00:06:39,796 --> 00:06:41,230
and leaves in a bad mood.

00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,131
They love it.
They come back --
What's it cost for the bike?

00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:45,868
So, these particular bikes
ran me about $2,000.

00:06:45,868 --> 00:06:47,502
Each?
Each.

00:06:47,502 --> 00:06:50,672
That thing cannot cost $2,000,
even with the blender.

00:06:50,672 --> 00:06:52,106
These are
my high-end bikes.

00:06:52,106 --> 00:06:55,142
My originals, I made
out of Schwinn exercise bikes.

00:06:55,142 --> 00:06:58,479
It cost me about 400 bucks
to make one of those bikes.

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,081
There was a few problems
with that.

00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:02,515
I couldn't lower the seat
all the way down for kids.

00:07:02,515 --> 00:07:05,085
These bikes are safer,
more predictable,

00:07:05,085 --> 00:07:07,921
and they're gonna give me
long-term return.

00:07:07,921 --> 00:07:09,122
But the prem--
the premise is nuts,

00:07:09,122 --> 00:07:11,825
because it's a
capacity-constraint function.

00:07:11,825 --> 00:07:14,193
I mean, do you have
a real blender back there?

00:07:14,193 --> 00:07:15,227
No.

00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:16,128
W-what are you, nuts?!

00:07:17,329 --> 00:07:18,764
That's part of
the beauty of it.

00:07:18,764 --> 00:07:20,432
You don't need a real blender.
No, no, it's not beautiful.

00:07:20,432 --> 00:07:21,500
It's ugly!
You really don't.

00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,668
It's -- it's not.

00:07:22,668 --> 00:07:23,902
It's beautiful,
and -- and it's efficient.

00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,170
I can bust out
as many smoothies on these

00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,072
in the same timeframe
as a busy Jamba Juice.

00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,307
Versus a blender?

00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:32,810
Now, what do you -- what do you
plan on doing with the money?

00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,245
With $50,000,
that'll give me enough money

00:07:35,245 --> 00:07:37,080
to open two more carts
just like that.

00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,782
Never mind that, Ryan.

00:07:38,782 --> 00:07:40,484
What are you planning
to do with your life?
Downtown --

00:07:40,484 --> 00:07:43,153
[laughter]

00:07:43,153 --> 00:07:45,488
It's like --
I'm just trying
to stay in shape

00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:46,923
and get a smoothie afterward.

00:07:46,923 --> 00:07:48,257
[laughter]

00:07:48,257 --> 00:07:50,293
Brian,
this is so crazy

00:07:50,293 --> 00:07:52,028
that it might actually
be brilliant.

00:07:52,028 --> 00:07:52,995
It is.

00:07:54,563 --> 00:07:56,531
Brian, I think
it's a very happy business,

00:07:56,531 --> 00:07:58,099
and that,
I have to hand to you,

00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:01,102
but I have to tell you,
it doesn't make any sense.

00:08:02,837 --> 00:08:04,940
Do you guys want to talk
about the numbers?

00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,507
I'm profitable.
No, you gave us
the numbers.

00:08:06,507 --> 00:08:07,675
It's just not investable.

00:08:07,675 --> 00:08:09,143
And this is our first year.

00:08:09,143 --> 00:08:10,044
I know. I'm out.

00:08:13,647 --> 00:08:14,949
Daymond,
you love healthy foods.

00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:17,350
You love --
you love to be outside.

00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,619
JOHN: Brian,
you look like a gerbil,

00:08:19,619 --> 00:08:21,087
working at the place, man.
[laughs]

00:08:21,087 --> 00:08:23,289
I-I love -- I love being
a gerbil in that machine.

00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:24,290
It's great.

00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,591
[laughter]

00:08:25,591 --> 00:08:27,460
O'LEARY: You know, Ryan,
I can time-travel,

00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,961
and I've gone
to the future.

00:08:28,961 --> 00:08:30,262
Here's the headline --

00:08:30,262 --> 00:08:33,432
"Man dies of cardiac arrest
blending smoothies."

00:08:33,432 --> 00:08:35,000
[laughter]
I'm out.

00:08:36,234 --> 00:08:38,703
How long did it take you
to make that $70,000?

00:08:38,703 --> 00:08:40,538
Well, since January.

00:08:40,538 --> 00:08:42,373
And how much did you net?

00:08:42,373 --> 00:08:43,307
We're netting 20%,

00:08:44,408 --> 00:08:47,578
and we're anticipating
$150,000 worth of sales

00:08:47,578 --> 00:08:49,312
from this cart next year,

00:08:49,312 --> 00:08:52,115
$150,000 for our second cart,
and $150,000 for our third.

00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,451
I think, you know,
it's very, very clever.

00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:55,986
What do you mean,
"clever"?

00:08:55,986 --> 00:08:58,154
I don't see it scaling.
I'm out.

00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,857
Ryan, I think
it's a cute little business.

00:09:01,857 --> 00:09:03,392
This looks like
it belongs on,

00:09:03,392 --> 00:09:05,094
you know,
on an island or something.

00:09:05,094 --> 00:09:06,161
It's really fun.

00:09:06,161 --> 00:09:07,463
You know, piña coladas
being made out of it.

00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:08,630
I just --
Yeah, that's true.

00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,299
I could -- on a beach
or something, yeah?

00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,433
You know, Gilligan actually used
one of these bikes.

00:09:12,433 --> 00:09:14,802
[laughs]
Exactly.

00:09:14,802 --> 00:09:17,372
But as for me...

00:09:17,372 --> 00:09:18,473
I'm out.

00:09:18,473 --> 00:09:20,608
Thank you.

00:09:21,975 --> 00:09:23,276
I love the idea.

00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:25,645
What I don't like
is the cost of the bikes.

00:09:25,645 --> 00:09:26,646
Right.

00:09:26,646 --> 00:09:28,382
Mark, he doesn't
make the bikes!

00:09:28,382 --> 00:09:29,816
I know.
That's the catch.

00:09:29,816 --> 00:09:32,818
If you were the bike guy instead
of the juice-and-smoothie guy,

00:09:32,818 --> 00:09:34,653
I would be all over it.

00:09:34,653 --> 00:09:36,822
I -- they're not doing
what I'm doing.

00:09:36,822 --> 00:09:38,424
I-I think
you're innovative.

00:09:38,424 --> 00:09:41,027
You took a concept
that I didn't even know existed,

00:09:41,027 --> 00:09:43,661
the blender bike,
and turned it into a business.

00:09:43,661 --> 00:09:46,464
If you were the bike guy
and you found an application

00:09:46,464 --> 00:09:47,799
and smoothies
was the first application,

00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,000
I'd be all over it,

00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,936
but you're not,
and so for that reason, I'm out.

00:09:53,537 --> 00:09:54,705
All right.
Well, thank you, Mark.

00:09:54,705 --> 00:09:55,773
I appreciate that.

00:09:55,773 --> 00:09:58,108
Good luck.
Thank you, guys.

00:09:58,108 --> 00:09:59,376
Thanks, Ryan.
Take care.

00:10:03,946 --> 00:10:06,282
It needs
to be on an island.

00:10:06,282 --> 00:10:09,118
Making margaritas --
you got that one right.

00:10:09,118 --> 00:10:10,486
Stupid.

00:10:21,263 --> 00:10:24,266
NARRATOR: Next into the tank
is a former C.I.A. agent

00:10:24,266 --> 00:10:27,234
who wants to expose
the tricks of the trade.

00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,676
Hi, sharks.
My name is Jason Hanson.

00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:38,244
My company
is Spy Escape &amp; Evasion,

00:10:38,244 --> 00:10:40,680
and I am seeking $100,000

00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,982
in exchange
for 15% of my company.

00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,419
The world of espionage
is a dangerous one.

00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:50,255
To survive, you need to be able
to adapt to any situation.

00:10:50,255 --> 00:10:52,324
You need to blend in
with your surroundings.

00:10:52,324 --> 00:10:56,261
And only when necessary do you
reveal your true identity.

00:11:01,566 --> 00:11:04,469
Actually, sharks, my name
is Hanson -- Jason Hanson.

00:11:06,704 --> 00:11:08,772
Thank you for your help.

00:11:08,772 --> 00:11:11,374
As a former C.I.A. officer,
I can also tell you

00:11:11,374 --> 00:11:13,677
that you need to be able
to detect a threat.

00:11:13,677 --> 00:11:15,846
You need to be able to adapt
to any situation, as mentioned.

00:11:15,846 --> 00:11:18,715
You also need to be able
to escape capture.

00:11:18,715 --> 00:11:21,350
Let's do a little training
exercise, and I'll show you.

00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,918
Barbara,
do you mind assisting me?

00:11:22,918 --> 00:11:25,187
I'm gonna have you come
and duct-tape my hands.

00:11:25,187 --> 00:11:26,522
I love
this kind of stuff.

00:11:26,522 --> 00:11:29,258
[laughter]
Don't tell Kevin!

00:11:29,258 --> 00:11:30,558
What I'm gonna have you do

00:11:30,558 --> 00:11:32,494
is just go around my wrists
three or four times --

00:11:32,494 --> 00:11:33,528
whatever you prefer.

00:11:33,528 --> 00:11:34,896
Happily.

00:11:34,896 --> 00:11:36,998
Don't worry about the hair.
It'll grow back.

00:11:36,998 --> 00:11:38,032
That's perfect.

00:11:38,032 --> 00:11:39,400
[chuckles]

00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,567
Thank you very much,
Barbara.

00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:41,802
That's it?
I appreciate it.

00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:43,337
That's -- well, there'll be
more later, I promise, okay?

00:11:43,337 --> 00:11:44,671
I'm coming back.
You can hold on to that.

00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:47,941
So, the fact is, sharks,

00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:50,077
criminals love to use duct tape
to kidnap people,

00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:53,045
but if the victims knew
how easy it is to escape,

00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,414
many would still be alive.

00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:56,849
Ooh.
JOHN: Oh, wow.

00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:59,152
These techniques
are simple and effective.

00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:01,820
But it's not just spies who can
benefit from this knowledge.

00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,722
Everyday civilians
can use these secrets

00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,724
to keep themselves
and their families safer.

00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,325
What was that secret?

00:12:07,325 --> 00:12:08,360
It's the angle.

00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,095
So, if I got duct-taped
like this,

00:12:10,095 --> 00:12:11,363
it wouldn't be as tight.

00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:12,963
You got to have your elbows
together and tight.

00:12:12,963 --> 00:12:15,366
That way, the friction of
going down at that exact angle,

00:12:15,366 --> 00:12:16,634
and then it's gonna pop that.

00:12:16,634 --> 00:12:18,369
Impressive.

00:12:18,369 --> 00:12:19,570
Sharks, your mission,

00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,206
should you choose to accept it,
is this.

00:12:22,206 --> 00:12:25,542
Invest in me, and together,
we'll build Spy Escape &amp; Evasion

00:12:25,542 --> 00:12:27,710
into the largest
and most valuable

00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,212
training experience
in the country.

00:12:29,212 --> 00:12:31,247
Now, which one of you would like
some additional training?

00:12:31,247 --> 00:12:32,382
Robert, you want some
additional training right now?

00:12:32,382 --> 00:12:33,882
Yes.
Okay.

00:12:33,882 --> 00:12:35,450
I love this stuff.
How about you come up here,

00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,852
and let me grab a chair.

00:12:36,852 --> 00:12:38,587
There you go. Perfect.
All right.

00:12:38,587 --> 00:12:39,588
Okay.

00:12:39,588 --> 00:12:40,923
So,
this is a zip tie --

00:12:40,923 --> 00:12:44,126
but not the cheap, little ones
that can break easily.

00:12:44,126 --> 00:12:45,560
Oh, you can't
get out of this.

00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,694
I'm gonna show you.

00:12:46,694 --> 00:12:48,462
So, what you do
is put your wrists together.

00:12:48,462 --> 00:12:50,298
Okay.

00:12:50,298 --> 00:12:51,966
So, Robert...
Wow.

00:12:51,966 --> 00:12:53,134
You can just try
and go like that,

00:12:53,134 --> 00:12:54,435
and they'll verify that...
it's the real deal.

00:12:54,435 --> 00:12:56,236
If you were to look down
at my shoes,

00:12:56,236 --> 00:12:58,171
you would see they appear
as regular dress shoes.

00:12:58,171 --> 00:12:59,806
Also, the black laces,

00:12:59,806 --> 00:13:02,075
they appear
as regular black laces.

00:13:02,075 --> 00:13:04,911
What I've done is switched out
my laces with 550 cord,

00:13:04,911 --> 00:13:06,312
also called parachute cord.

00:13:06,312 --> 00:13:08,714
So, what I would do
is take off my shoelaces,

00:13:08,714 --> 00:13:10,649
put them together,
but to save time,

00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:12,785
this is what it would form.

00:13:12,785 --> 00:13:14,320
So,
what you'd have to do --

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,055
and I'll do it for you,
Robert --

00:13:16,055 --> 00:13:17,589
you go
right through there.

00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:20,525
I'm gonna put this down
over this shoe.

00:13:20,525 --> 00:13:22,060
Now, Robert would have
made this.

00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,329
Now, Robert, you remember
how to ride a bicycle?
Yeah.

00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:25,663
I'll get down on the ground
for you.

00:13:25,663 --> 00:13:27,931
You're just gonna go like this
and bicycle,

00:13:27,931 --> 00:13:29,032
and then
it's gonna pop that.

00:13:29,032 --> 00:13:31,401
So just pretend
you're riding a bike.

00:13:31,401 --> 00:13:32,536
Oh, my God!

00:13:32,536 --> 00:13:33,971
There you go.
I'm amazed!

00:13:33,971 --> 00:13:35,606
Hey!
Wow!

00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:36,607
That easy.

00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,641
That's unbelievable.

00:13:38,641 --> 00:13:39,909
Thank you.

00:13:39,909 --> 00:13:41,377
Wow.

00:13:41,377 --> 00:13:42,678
Jason, were you really
a C.I.A. agent?

00:13:42,678 --> 00:13:44,080
I am a former C.I.A. officer,

00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,448
and if I had to tell you
any more,

00:13:45,448 --> 00:13:46,882
I'd have to kill you, so...

00:13:46,882 --> 00:13:48,717
Tell him more!
[laughs]

00:13:48,717 --> 00:13:51,152
Yes, I'm really ex-C.I.A.

00:13:51,152 --> 00:13:52,954
You're disposing
a lot of what I think

00:13:52,954 --> 00:13:54,422
are proprietary pieces
of information.

00:13:54,422 --> 00:13:55,991
I'm just wondering,
if I invested in you,

00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:57,392
one day,
you don't show up for work.

00:13:57,392 --> 00:13:58,893
[laughs]

00:13:58,893 --> 00:14:00,127
Nothing I'm sharing
is confidential.

00:14:00,127 --> 00:14:01,462
I've already had a talk
with the agency.

00:14:01,462 --> 00:14:02,563
I'm allowed to do this.

00:14:02,563 --> 00:14:03,931
I just can't share anything,
obviously --

00:14:03,931 --> 00:14:05,232
so, you think the chances
of you getting whacked

00:14:05,232 --> 00:14:07,868
and just being
turned into fish food are low.

00:14:07,868 --> 00:14:09,936
I'm very good at what I do,
so I'd say it's low.

00:14:09,936 --> 00:14:11,104
CUBAN: So, wait.

00:14:11,104 --> 00:14:12,438
You haven't told us
what the business is,

00:14:12,438 --> 00:14:14,140
what you're trying to do,
so...

00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,476
Spy escape &amp; evasion
is a two-day course.

00:14:16,476 --> 00:14:19,479
The first day, you learn
Spy Escape &amp; Evasion skills

00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:21,647
such as how to pick locks,
how to escape rope,

00:14:21,647 --> 00:14:22,814
how to escape duct tape,

00:14:22,814 --> 00:14:25,217
how to detect and evade
surveillance.

00:14:25,217 --> 00:14:28,086
Day 2 is
a field-training exercise,

00:14:28,086 --> 00:14:30,522
so you take all the operational
skills from day 1,

00:14:30,522 --> 00:14:32,423
you go on a series of missions,

00:14:32,423 --> 00:14:34,558
and I have trackers
and surveillance guys

00:14:34,558 --> 00:14:37,428
hunting you down to see if
you can complete your missions.

00:14:37,428 --> 00:14:39,330
Now, it's a very fun,
exciting course,

00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:41,599
but it's also
a practical self-defense course

00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:42,666
to keep you safe.

00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,234
Do you have this in place
right now?

00:14:44,234 --> 00:14:45,502
Correct. Yes.

00:14:45,502 --> 00:14:47,237
And what are your sales?

00:14:47,237 --> 00:14:50,707
$306,000 gross,
$128,000 net.

00:14:50,707 --> 00:14:52,409
Was that in one year,
or was that over
a period of time?

00:14:52,409 --> 00:14:54,209
That's in one year.
That is year-to-date.

00:14:55,044 --> 00:14:57,112
Who is this course
designed for?

00:14:57,112 --> 00:14:58,414
Great question.

00:14:58,414 --> 00:15:00,115
So, it started out
for high-net-worth individuals,

00:15:00,115 --> 00:15:02,918
so I was just doing it
for C.E.O.s, executives.

00:15:02,918 --> 00:15:06,087
But then I had -- just everyday
people started taking my course.

00:15:06,087 --> 00:15:07,622
How much is the course?

00:15:07,622 --> 00:15:09,490
This course is $600.

00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:10,858
For two days?
Correct.

00:15:10,858 --> 00:15:12,126
And where are you at?
Where are you based?

00:15:12,126 --> 00:15:13,161
Cedar City, Utah.

00:15:13,161 --> 00:15:14,928
[laughing]
Cedar City, Utah?

00:15:14,928 --> 00:15:17,731
Well, actually,
I just moved there last year --

00:15:17,731 --> 00:15:19,366
I'm from
the Washington, D.C., area --

00:15:19,366 --> 00:15:21,535
and so I was
teaching it there, doing well,

00:15:21,535 --> 00:15:22,936
moved out there,

00:15:22,936 --> 00:15:24,304
and that's actually
what I want to talk to you about

00:15:24,304 --> 00:15:25,438
for the money for.

00:15:25,438 --> 00:15:26,439
Okay.

00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:28,774
My wife and I have 320 acres

00:15:28,774 --> 00:15:31,243
that we're gonna close in
two weeks in Cedar City, Utah,

00:15:31,243 --> 00:15:33,479
and I want to build
Spy Escape &amp; Evasion ranch.

00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:36,781
I want to make it a premier
self-defense training facility.

00:15:36,781 --> 00:15:38,550
[laughing]
Spy escape &amp; evasion ranch!

00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:41,086
So, we're gonna teach
the spy courses.

00:15:41,086 --> 00:15:43,288
I want to do evasive driving,
which you would love.

00:15:43,288 --> 00:15:45,557
And then I want to have
a whole spy obstacle course,

00:15:45,557 --> 00:15:47,191
the toughest obstacle
course on the planet.

00:15:47,191 --> 00:15:49,526
But that's gonna
require more capital to
build that out, right?

00:15:49,526 --> 00:15:51,495
You're gonna need m--
Well, that's what I want
the $100,000 for.

00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:55,299
How are you making money
right now off the course?

00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:56,699
'cause you don't have
the land developed yet,

00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:57,900
so how are you making money
right now?

00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,235
Right now,
I fly around the country,

00:15:59,235 --> 00:16:01,637
so I do a course in Las Vegas,
in Washington, D.C.,

00:16:01,637 --> 00:16:03,639
in San Di--
And how do acquire
those customers?

00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:05,608
Magazine ads
and then internet.

00:16:05,608 --> 00:16:08,343
But what if we want to get
to $20 million in sales, right?

00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:10,312
Just Jason's
not gonna be enough.

00:16:10,312 --> 00:16:11,980
Who else is out there
that can be

00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,216
an authoritative teacher
so we could grow this?

00:16:14,216 --> 00:16:15,784
Obviously,
I'm gonna find people

00:16:15,784 --> 00:16:18,152
with ex-agency background
or ex-military background.

00:16:18,152 --> 00:16:20,821
I mean, I've had a ton of these
guys already take my course.

00:16:20,821 --> 00:16:22,757
CORCORAN: It really is a mistake
on your part

00:16:22,757 --> 00:16:24,625
assuming people
will come out to Utah

00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,660
to come
and be at your camp,

00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,895
so I'm out.

00:16:27,895 --> 00:16:29,896
All right, well,
I'm sorry to hear that, Barbara.

00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,967
Jason, what I see
is two different directions.

00:16:33,967 --> 00:16:36,936
The Model That seems to work
is when you go to a city,

00:16:36,936 --> 00:16:38,471
show up for two days,
train people.

00:16:38,471 --> 00:16:43,375
They don't want to fly to Utah,
because it's too expensive.

00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:46,378
It quadruples the cost
and takes a lot of time.

00:16:46,378 --> 00:16:48,614
I do not want to invest
in the Ponderosa.

00:16:48,614 --> 00:16:49,915
[laughter]

00:16:49,915 --> 00:16:51,449
But what you guys haven't
let me say is I'm flexible.

00:16:51,449 --> 00:16:52,850
I obviously lack the knowledge.

00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:55,253
If you guys, who are much
smarter businesspeople than me,

00:16:55,253 --> 00:16:57,922
say, "You know what?
This is the model.
It's not the land."

00:16:57,922 --> 00:17:00,057
Obviously, I'd be an idiot
not to listen to that,

00:17:00,057 --> 00:17:02,125
because you have
the business experience

00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,593
and the knowledge
that I lack.

00:17:03,593 --> 00:17:05,228
It's half-baked.
I'm out.

00:17:05,228 --> 00:17:07,397
All right.
Thank you, Kevin.

00:17:08,865 --> 00:17:11,600
Jason,
I love this stuff.

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,969
I actually think there's
a pretty big market for it.

00:17:13,969 --> 00:17:18,040
But I hate the business idea
you came out here with today.

00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,109
I mean...
Forget about the land, then.

00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,477
[laughter]
I'm flexible.
I lack the knowledge.

00:17:21,477 --> 00:17:23,244
You know, and --
What land?

00:17:23,244 --> 00:17:24,646
There goes the Ponderosa.

00:17:24,646 --> 00:17:25,880
I'm trying
to be nice to you,

00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,749
'cause you could be
packing heat, so I don't know.

00:17:27,749 --> 00:17:32,253
I am interested in the idea
of selling the seminar,

00:17:32,253 --> 00:17:36,590
but you should be filling
entire seminar rooms,

00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,193
like big hotel rooms.
and I lack the marketing
knowledge to do that.

00:17:39,193 --> 00:17:40,661
Well, the other thing
you're lacking

00:17:40,661 --> 00:17:42,296
is you don't have
any upsell.
Mm-hmm.

00:17:42,296 --> 00:17:44,630
You should have
a subscription -- e-mail

00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,265
or "Here's the latest threats
in the world" --

00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:47,533
Stuff like that.
Right.

00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,202
But I think you're the guy.
I think you could make it.

00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:50,436
I think
you could build that

00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:51,938
into a multi-million-dollar
business.

00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:53,506
I'll make you
an offer.
Okay.

00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:57,909
I'll give you $100,000
for 50%.

00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,245
First thing we got to do

00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,613
is you got to create
some material

00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:02,981
that you can sell
at these places,

00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:05,549
and then
we start testing cities

00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:07,918
to see
what the paying point is

00:18:07,918 --> 00:18:10,154
and how we can use that money
to build larger seminars.

00:18:11,288 --> 00:18:14,391
$100,000 for 50%.

00:18:14,391 --> 00:18:15,925
Look, that's the offer
I'm gonna make you,

00:18:15,925 --> 00:18:17,961
and I'm only making you
that offer because

00:18:17,961 --> 00:18:20,563
it's a completely different plan
than you came out with.

00:18:20,563 --> 00:18:22,065
I understand.

00:18:22,065 --> 00:18:24,167
Greedy savage, table of one.
Your table's ready.

00:18:24,167 --> 00:18:25,468
It's the right business.

00:18:25,468 --> 00:18:27,236
If you want to invest
in land in Utah, Daymond...

00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:28,470
Are you gonna make him
an offer

00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,772
or just insult
the only one he's got?

00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,183
NARRATOR:
Two sharks are out.

00:18:42,183 --> 00:18:46,420
Robert has made Jason an offer
of $100,000

00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,422
for a 50% stake
in his company.

00:18:49,422 --> 00:18:51,391
Look, that's the offer
I'm gonna make you,

00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:53,193
and I'm only making
that offer because

00:18:53,193 --> 00:18:55,662
it's a completely different plan
than you came out with.

00:18:55,662 --> 00:18:57,864
I understand.

00:18:57,864 --> 00:18:59,765
Greedy savage, table of one.
Your table's ready.

00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:01,066
It's the right business.

00:19:01,066 --> 00:19:02,735
If you want to invest
in land in Utah, Daymond...

00:19:02,735 --> 00:19:04,136
Are you gonna make him
an offer

00:19:04,136 --> 00:19:05,738
or just insult
the only one he's got?

00:19:05,738 --> 00:19:07,606
[laughing] I'm so amazed
at the offer he just got.

00:19:08,974 --> 00:19:11,142
Daymond? Mark?

00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,846
Look, I like the kind of
training aspect of it.

00:19:14,846 --> 00:19:15,914
That's interesting.

00:19:15,914 --> 00:19:18,049
But I don't see that
as the grand slam.

00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:21,351
I think the hottest trend
right now in entertainment

00:19:21,351 --> 00:19:23,487
is experiences, right?

00:19:23,487 --> 00:19:27,224
I could absolutely,
positively see putting together

00:19:27,224 --> 00:19:29,960
a fun, you know,
one-day or overnight spy school.

00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,160
Mm-hmm.

00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,730
And you're charging 50 bucks
or 60 bucks or 70 bucks,

00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:37,733
and you might get
300, 400 people coming through

00:19:37,733 --> 00:19:39,235
and doing
all these different things.

00:19:39,235 --> 00:19:40,636
O'LEARY:
By the time this is over,

00:19:40,636 --> 00:19:41,903
you're gonna have to
send him an invoice

00:19:41,903 --> 00:19:42,971
for rewriting
his business plan.

00:19:42,971 --> 00:19:44,272
[laughs]
That's okay,
'cause, see,

00:19:44,272 --> 00:19:45,640
That's the difference
between us, Kevin.

00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,509
You just look
and see A, B, and C.

00:19:47,509 --> 00:19:49,077
It's a weakness
in the presentation.

00:19:49,077 --> 00:19:51,079
I look at A, B, and C
and see X, Y, Z.

00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:52,546
That's the difference
between us.
It's a weakness
in the presentation.

00:19:52,546 --> 00:19:54,048
No, it's not.
It's just an opportunity.

00:19:54,048 --> 00:19:55,082
Like he said,
he's an entrepreneur.

00:19:55,082 --> 00:19:56,317
I think
Jason's gonna kidnap

00:19:56,317 --> 00:19:57,685
both of you in a moment
if you don't hurry up.

00:19:57,685 --> 00:19:59,086
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

00:20:00,354 --> 00:20:02,189
What are you doing, Mark?

00:20:02,189 --> 00:20:04,324
Well, talk to Daymond,
'cause I'm uncertain.

00:20:04,324 --> 00:20:05,725
I'm on --
I'm on the fence.

00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,362
Ay. All that
for being on the fence?

00:20:09,362 --> 00:20:11,464
Well, ask questions, you know?
You got to learn.

00:20:12,966 --> 00:20:14,499
All right. Daymond, sir.

00:20:18,036 --> 00:20:19,905
You cannot build
this property.

00:20:19,905 --> 00:20:22,040
You have to be able
to move around with it.

00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,775
And that's fine.
I know your model.

00:20:23,775 --> 00:20:27,445
Your model needs, really,
to be for moms and families

00:20:27,445 --> 00:20:29,680
and homes
in high-populated areas

00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,916
where they feel
that they could potentially face

00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:34,251
home invasion and other things
of that nature.

00:20:34,251 --> 00:20:37,220
Here's my offer --
$150,000 for 45% --

00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,189
but you got to take the offer
right now.

00:20:41,358 --> 00:20:42,959
Not gonna give me
a 24-second shot clock?

00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:44,094
No. That's it.

00:20:45,128 --> 00:20:47,029
All right. Let's do it. Done.
Good.

00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:48,330
Good move.
He's your best partner.

00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,365
Thank you.

00:20:49,365 --> 00:20:50,499
Thank you, sir.
All right.

00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,767
I appreciate it.
Yeah. You got it.

00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:53,002
Thank you.

00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,036
I like this guy.

00:20:55,604 --> 00:20:56,437
Congrats, Jason.

00:20:56,437 --> 00:20:57,839
Thank you.

00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,540
Today, I walked into the tank
with a mission,

00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,708
and I think it was accomplished.

00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,478
If we can teach thousands
upon thousands of people

00:21:03,478 --> 00:21:05,947
and one person's life
gets saved by this,

00:21:05,947 --> 00:21:07,948
then it's definitely worth it.

00:21:13,053 --> 00:21:15,889
NARRATOR:
Last season, we watched
Doug Marshall strike a deal

00:21:15,889 --> 00:21:17,257
with Mark and Lori

00:21:17,257 --> 00:21:19,558
for his unique alternative
to face paint, gameface.

00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:21,627
Let's do it.
Put your gameface on!

00:21:21,627 --> 00:21:22,695
Put your gameface on, baby!
Whoo-hoo!

00:21:22,695 --> 00:21:24,997
NARRATOR:
Let's see how he's doing now.

00:21:26,632 --> 00:21:28,500
MARSHALL: Making a deal
with Mark and Lori

00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,635
was the best thing I could have
done for my company.

00:21:30,635 --> 00:21:32,937
Get your gameface on, guys!
Let's go!

00:21:32,937 --> 00:21:35,607
My dream has always been
to be able to feature gamefaces

00:21:35,607 --> 00:21:38,610
at professional sport
league games around the country.

00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:42,246
Mark made that dream come true
by allowing us to give out

00:21:42,246 --> 00:21:44,782
thousands of gamefaces
to his most loyal mav fans.

00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:49,485
Hey, Mark.
What's up, dawg?

00:21:49,485 --> 00:21:50,653
[chuckles]
Good to see you.

00:21:50,653 --> 00:21:51,688
CUBAN: When we first did
the deal on "Shark Tank,"

00:21:51,688 --> 00:21:52,855
I knew it'd be a winner,

00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:54,090
but, you know,
it's good to get validation.

00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:55,525
When you bring it out
to the mavs games

00:21:55,525 --> 00:21:57,126
and the kids go nuts over it,

00:21:57,126 --> 00:21:58,594
we're showing them
on the jumbotron

00:21:58,594 --> 00:22:00,696
and everybody's going crazy
seeing them, this is exciting.

00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:02,197
I know Lori and I
are really fired up.

00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:05,033
Showing your fan pride
has just changed 180 degrees

00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:06,401
with gameface.

00:22:06,401 --> 00:22:08,503
MARSHALL:
We had been working on this

00:22:08,503 --> 00:22:11,672
for five, six years
and slowly being accepted.

00:22:11,672 --> 00:22:14,241
Since "Shark Tank,"
all of a sudden, bam --

00:22:14,241 --> 00:22:15,576
everybody wants it.

00:22:15,576 --> 00:22:19,046
In our first year of business,
we did $6,700 in sales.

00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,981
In the 10-month period
since airing,

00:22:20,981 --> 00:22:22,549
we've done $200,000 in sales.

00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,084
In order to keep up with demand,

00:22:24,084 --> 00:22:25,985
we had to change
our manufacturing process.

00:22:25,985 --> 00:22:28,021
With the finalization
of the product,

00:22:28,021 --> 00:22:31,091
we're able to project sales
of $2- to $20 million

00:22:31,091 --> 00:22:32,558
in the next 12 months.

00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:35,294
The possibilities for gameface
are endless.

00:22:35,294 --> 00:22:36,695
We're gonna have them
in all the colors

00:22:36,695 --> 00:22:37,896
of all the different teams.

00:22:37,896 --> 00:22:40,566
Our next step
is to launch licensed product

00:22:40,566 --> 00:22:43,501
from the NFL, NBA,
NHL, and NCAA.

00:22:43,501 --> 00:22:46,370
We're even working with
international soccer sponsors

00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:48,806
for the 2014 world cup.

00:22:48,806 --> 00:22:50,241
Those orders
could be in the millions.

00:22:50,241 --> 00:22:51,442
ALL: Defense!

00:22:51,442 --> 00:22:53,510
MARSHALL: So many people
want a small business

00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,578
or just have an idea.

00:22:54,578 --> 00:22:56,546
I had an idea,
created a business,

00:22:56,546 --> 00:22:58,081
went in front of the sharks,

00:22:58,081 --> 00:23:00,617
and it's changed our life
beyond our wildest dreams.

00:23:00,617 --> 00:23:02,419
[crowd cheers]

00:23:11,327 --> 00:23:14,463
NARRATOR: Next up is
a former wrestling superstar

00:23:14,463 --> 00:23:16,965
with a product
that changed his life.

00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:27,241
Hello, sharks.

00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:30,944
I'm former WWE world champion
diamond Dallas Page.

00:23:30,944 --> 00:23:32,579
And I'm Dallas' partner,
Steve yu.

00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:34,214
Our company's ddp yoga,

00:23:34,214 --> 00:23:38,518
and today, we're seeking
$200,000 for 5% of the company.

00:23:40,987 --> 00:23:43,456
Ddp yoga was created
out of necessity.

00:23:43,456 --> 00:23:45,591
You see, I didn't even become
a professional wrestler

00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,826
until I was 35 years old.

00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:51,196
My career did not take off
until I was 40.

00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:52,631
By the time I was 42,

00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:54,466
I was at the top
of the wrestling business,

00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:55,767
and bang!

00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,369
I blew my back out
so badly

00:23:58,369 --> 00:24:00,104
that three different
back specialists said

00:24:00,104 --> 00:24:01,705
my wrestling career
was over.

00:24:01,705 --> 00:24:02,840
So,
when it was suggested

00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,575
that I might try yoga
to heal my body,

00:24:04,575 --> 00:24:06,877
I got to be honest --
I was like, "Yoga?

00:24:06,877 --> 00:24:08,878
I'm a guy who wouldn't
be caught dead doing yoga!"

00:24:08,878 --> 00:24:10,814
But I was desperate
to save my career,

00:24:10,814 --> 00:24:12,081
so I gave it a shot,

00:24:12,081 --> 00:24:15,585
and in less than three months,
I was back in the ring.

00:24:15,585 --> 00:24:19,154
I proved the doctors wrong,
and at 43 years young,

00:24:19,154 --> 00:24:21,156
I was the heavyweight
champ of the world --

00:24:21,156 --> 00:24:23,992
not once, not twice,
but three times.

00:24:23,992 --> 00:24:27,529
You see, sharks, ddp yoga --
it ain't your mama's yoga.

00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:29,831
I combine the very best
of my old-school training

00:24:29,831 --> 00:24:32,400
with sports-rehabilitation
techniques, yoga positions,

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,435
and dynamic resistance

00:24:34,435 --> 00:24:37,238
to create the most
complete workout on the planet.

00:24:37,238 --> 00:24:39,207
It will dramatically increase
your flexibility

00:24:39,207 --> 00:24:41,641
and strengthen your core
like never before --

00:24:41,641 --> 00:24:45,111
all with
minimal joint impact.

00:24:45,111 --> 00:24:47,047
No other workout
can make that statement.

00:24:47,047 --> 00:24:49,783
Now, Dallas has spent years
developing this program,

00:24:49,783 --> 00:24:52,985
and we officially launched
ddp yoga two years ago,

00:24:52,985 --> 00:24:56,288
and we couldn't be more inspired
by people doing the workouts.

00:24:56,288 --> 00:24:57,790
Now, before you start
to grill us,

00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,859
let me show you
what ddp yoga did for me.

00:24:59,859 --> 00:25:01,727
When I blew my back out,

00:25:01,727 --> 00:25:03,261
this is
where my flexibility was.

00:25:03,261 --> 00:25:05,663
Today, this is where
my flexibility is.

00:25:05,663 --> 00:25:06,664
[exhales deeply]

00:25:06,664 --> 00:25:07,966
Wow.
PAGE: And being able

00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:12,070
to stand here and talk to you,
at 6'4", 226 pounds,

00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:14,538
and 57 years young,

00:25:14,538 --> 00:25:16,206
this is core strength
and balance

00:25:16,206 --> 00:25:17,407
at a whole different level.

00:25:17,407 --> 00:25:18,775
This is ddp yoga.

00:25:18,775 --> 00:25:21,845
Now, to show you that
just about anyone can do this,

00:25:21,845 --> 00:25:23,746
let me tell you about a guy
named Arthur boorman --

00:25:23,746 --> 00:25:25,214
disabled veteran

00:25:25,214 --> 00:25:29,785
that was 5'6", 297 pounds
when I first got with him

00:25:29,785 --> 00:25:33,189
and couldn't walk
without the aid of knee braces,

00:25:33,189 --> 00:25:35,423
back brace, or wraparound canes.

00:25:35,423 --> 00:25:36,892
Let me introduce you to him.

00:25:36,892 --> 00:25:38,159
Arthur, come on down here.

00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,195
He not only lost 140 pounds
in 10 months,

00:25:40,195 --> 00:25:42,731
he lost the knee braces,
the back brace,

00:25:42,731 --> 00:25:45,933
and the wraparound canes --
can not only walk, but run.

00:25:45,933 --> 00:25:48,602
CORCORAN: Whoa, no way.
This is not the same guy.
This is -.
This is the same guy.

00:25:48,602 --> 00:25:49,904
Wow.
CUBAN:
Good for you, buddy.

00:25:49,904 --> 00:25:52,640
Former staff sergeant
Arthur boorman.

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,608
Wow.
What a beast.

00:25:55,608 --> 00:25:57,443
Over 10 million views
on his video.

00:25:57,443 --> 00:25:59,379
Really?
Really.

00:25:59,379 --> 00:26:01,814
JOHN: Wow. Congrats.
Arthur, you swear to God
that's you in the video?

00:26:01,814 --> 00:26:03,216
That is me in the video.
CUBAN: Yeah, it looks like him.

00:26:03,216 --> 00:26:04,217
Yeah.
I mean, face-wise.

00:26:04,217 --> 00:26:05,218
Amazing.
Wow.

00:26:05,218 --> 00:26:06,218
Arthur,
why don't you show them

00:26:06,218 --> 00:26:07,686
some of the things
that you can do now?

00:26:07,686 --> 00:26:10,656
He couldn't stand on two legs,
never mind one leg.

00:26:10,656 --> 00:26:12,124
Good for you, Arthur.

00:26:12,124 --> 00:26:13,725
And his flexibility --
cold.

00:26:13,725 --> 00:26:15,060
CUBAN: Oh, damn.
JOHN: Whoa.

00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,295
Oh, wow.
Wow.

00:26:16,295 --> 00:26:17,929
PAGE: 53 years young.

00:26:17,929 --> 00:26:19,630
And how did you find
Dallas?

00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:22,500
Well, y-you kind of have to
understand how desperate I was.

00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,335
I was really bad-off.

00:26:24,335 --> 00:26:28,004
I could not -- I couldn't
do anything on my own.

00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:29,973
My wife had to dress me
in the morning.

00:26:29,973 --> 00:26:34,277
I could not
live like that anymore,

00:26:34,277 --> 00:26:37,147
and I tried different things,
and nothing worked.

00:26:37,147 --> 00:26:39,915
So, I was on the internet,
typing in different things,

00:26:39,915 --> 00:26:44,053
and one time, I just typed in
"Yoga, broken back" --

00:26:44,053 --> 00:26:45,688
up popped
Dallas Page.

00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:46,655
CORCORAN: Wow.
Hm.

00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,625
Okay, so, let's get into
the business, Dallas, guys.

00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:51,826
Sure.
Yeah, the first year,

00:26:51,826 --> 00:26:53,695
we -- we pretty much beat
our expectations.

00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,697
We were hoping to do maybe
a quarter of a million dollars,

00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:58,599
and we actually sold
$2.6 million.

00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:00,133
Oh, wow.
JOHN: In the first year?

00:27:00,133 --> 00:27:01,768
Today,
we just broke $3 million.

00:27:01,768 --> 00:27:03,070
Dang.
YU:
We broke $3 million.

00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,404
PAGE:
And that's with DVDs.

00:27:04,404 --> 00:27:06,840
Well, what was your profit
on the $3 million yielded?

00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,376
We netted $890,000.

00:27:09,376 --> 00:27:10,943
Before you paid yourselves
anything?

00:27:10,943 --> 00:27:12,178
Oh, we paid ourselves.

00:27:12,178 --> 00:27:13,679
So, that's after
you paid yourselves.
Oh, yeah.

00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,915
So, if I gave you
$200,000,

00:27:15,915 --> 00:27:17,550
how exactly
would you spend that money?

00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,986
We would put that
towards building

00:27:19,986 --> 00:27:23,021
the first mobile application
for ddp yoga.

00:27:23,021 --> 00:27:25,090
So, it's still being
sold in a DVD and
a book format, right?

00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,057
Right.
That's right.

00:27:26,057 --> 00:27:28,426
So, where do you come from,
Steve?

00:27:28,426 --> 00:27:31,695
How -- how did you end up,
you know, working with Dallas?

00:27:31,695 --> 00:27:35,599
I started trying to do
filmmaking to create stories

00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:38,068
that would inspire people
to change their lives,

00:27:38,068 --> 00:27:40,037
and then, you know,
Dallas and I spoke about it,

00:27:40,037 --> 00:27:41,338
and I said,
"Well, let me --

00:27:41,338 --> 00:27:43,139
"You know, I've got
a lot of documentary footage.

00:27:43,139 --> 00:27:45,141
Let me try
to retell Arthur's story."

00:27:45,141 --> 00:27:46,309
I'll tell you

00:27:46,309 --> 00:27:47,877
what's really fascinating me
and concerning me.

00:27:47,877 --> 00:27:49,412
We see
a lot of exercise programs

00:27:49,412 --> 00:27:50,580
coming into the Shark Tank.

00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,215
All the models we've seen,

00:27:52,215 --> 00:27:54,016
including the ones
that have been successful,

00:27:54,016 --> 00:27:55,684
have used an ingredient
that's very expensive --

00:27:55,684 --> 00:27:56,752
infomercials.

00:27:56,752 --> 00:27:58,687
They bought remnant time
on cable.

00:27:58,687 --> 00:28:00,989
That's the barrier to entry
in this space.
Yes.

00:28:00,989 --> 00:28:03,724
And so what I'm concerned about
in looking at your deal

00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:07,395
is you don't have
any of that in place.

00:28:07,395 --> 00:28:10,331
Yes, we do.
We start airing our Doc--

00:28:10,331 --> 00:28:12,767
not an infomercial,
it's a docu-mercial --

00:28:12,767 --> 00:28:14,834
we're reinventing
the infomercial.

00:28:14,834 --> 00:28:16,936
Are you buying
the airtime?
Yes.
We've already bought it.

00:28:16,936 --> 00:28:18,371
We're testing now.
We're testing right now.

00:28:18,371 --> 00:28:19,773
CORCORAN: Wait. How much money
did you spend on it?

00:28:19,773 --> 00:28:20,874
Well, they've got $890,000
in profits.

00:28:20,874 --> 00:28:21,975
That's what you do
with profits, right?

00:28:21,975 --> 00:28:23,309
Yeah, so, we -- yeah,

00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:24,811
we didn't have
that flexibility before.
Reinvest.

00:28:24,811 --> 00:28:26,278
JOHN: So,
here's what I think, Dallas.

00:28:26,278 --> 00:28:29,248
I think that you're asking
for $200,000, 5%.

00:28:29,248 --> 00:28:30,916
You're valuing the company
at $4 million.

00:28:30,916 --> 00:28:33,318
Really, that's not bad,
to be very honest.

00:28:33,318 --> 00:28:36,721
Um, but I've invested
in some fitness brands before --

00:28:36,721 --> 00:28:38,189
Billy Blanks Jr.,
cowboy Ryan --

00:28:38,189 --> 00:28:40,358
and I'm finding out
about all the challenges.

00:28:40,358 --> 00:28:45,063
It is a massive, massive drain
on my time and energy,

00:28:45,063 --> 00:28:47,230
so for that reason, I'm out.

00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,865
Thank you very much.

00:28:48,865 --> 00:28:50,200
You guys know
as well as I do --

00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,668
and I think
that's why you're here --

00:28:51,668 --> 00:28:53,003
that there will be
a transition.

00:28:53,003 --> 00:28:55,806
It's gonna get more difficult
to sell DVDs.

00:28:55,806 --> 00:28:57,740
The difficult factor
for me

00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:00,576
is that
when you transition to online,

00:29:00,576 --> 00:29:03,946
the pricing, the profitability,
the risk/reward

00:29:03,946 --> 00:29:06,415
is 180 degrees different,
right?

00:29:06,415 --> 00:29:09,751
So coming in,
we're creating a new company.

00:29:09,751 --> 00:29:13,354
It's just too great
a risk profile for me.

00:29:13,354 --> 00:29:15,623
Sure.
And so while I say,
"Good job, good effort,"

00:29:15,623 --> 00:29:18,325
I have to say,
for that reason, I'm out.

00:29:18,325 --> 00:29:21,061
Thanks. Appreciate that.
Thank you,
and congrats, guys.

00:29:21,061 --> 00:29:23,831
I don't like investing
in businesses that are
based on trends.

00:29:23,831 --> 00:29:26,433
All the up and down,
it just doesn't work for me.

00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:29,402
I fear that your big hit
already happened

00:29:29,402 --> 00:29:31,304
on the backs
of this great story.

00:29:31,304 --> 00:29:32,772
I don't have the faith
to go up and down

00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:34,140
on the roller-coaster ride
with you.

00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,374
I'm out.

00:29:36,709 --> 00:29:39,212
The challenge I have is,
as Mark said,

00:29:39,212 --> 00:29:41,480
is you want to create
a brand-new business.

00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,616
You're gonna burn
all your profit

00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,518
going into
the infomercial route.

00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,186
The thing about that,
Robert,

00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:50,588
is we're not going
into this infomercial world

00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:52,123
and just
dumping our money in.

00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,824
We're -- we're being
very cautious.

00:29:53,824 --> 00:29:57,561
Maybe. I just -- I'm --
I'm not believing in that route.

00:29:57,561 --> 00:30:01,898
And for the 5% for $200,000
when you're making $900,000,

00:30:01,898 --> 00:30:03,766
you know,
I just don't see it.

00:30:03,766 --> 00:30:04,734
I'm out.

00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:07,837
Well, Mr. Wonderful?

00:30:07,837 --> 00:30:10,206
O'LEARY: Yeah. Here's --
here's where I'm at.
[chuckles]

00:30:10,206 --> 00:30:12,608
It's rare that I --
I've got a, you know,

00:30:12,608 --> 00:30:14,009
an angel and a devil
on my shoulders

00:30:14,009 --> 00:30:15,878
saying, "Do this deal.
Just ask for more."

00:30:15,878 --> 00:30:19,515
You're offering me $200,000
for 5%.

00:30:19,515 --> 00:30:21,950
$200,000 for 50%
would be more along...

00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:24,018
[laughs]
YU: Yeah. [laughs]

00:30:24,018 --> 00:30:26,487
I'm a good salesman, too,
and the reason you'd do this

00:30:26,487 --> 00:30:28,789
is I have to write another check
and another check

00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:30,691
and another check after
you figure out the metrics.

00:30:30,691 --> 00:30:33,793
Yeah, so then he'll own 70%,
and then 80%, then 120%.

00:30:33,793 --> 00:30:35,428
That's why
they call me Mr. Wonderful.

00:30:35,428 --> 00:30:37,430
You made $900,000
this year.

00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:40,000
You're offering that?
God. What an insult.

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,103
Unfortunately, the angst
I have about the future

00:30:44,103 --> 00:30:45,571
can't be ignored,

00:30:45,571 --> 00:30:47,339
so, for that reason, I'm out.

00:30:48,941 --> 00:30:50,376
PAGE: I really appreciate
your time,

00:30:50,376 --> 00:30:53,646
and you're gonna watch ddp yoga
become a household name.

00:30:53,646 --> 00:30:55,613
YU: Absolutely.
You're gonna be going,
"Oh, God!

00:30:55,613 --> 00:30:57,282
Why wasn't I
a part of that?"

00:30:57,282 --> 00:30:58,316
Thank you so much, guys.

00:30:58,316 --> 00:30:59,617
Thank you, guys.
Thank you.

00:30:59,617 --> 00:31:01,819
See ya. Bang!
Appreciate it.

00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:03,321
[laughter]
CUBAN: Good job.
Good effort, guys.

00:31:05,355 --> 00:31:07,824
I was almost gonna
have to hold Dallas back

00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,459
when he offered,
you know,

00:31:09,459 --> 00:31:10,827
he wanted
50% of our company.
oh, boy.

00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,863
I was eyeing him up
right there, man.

00:31:12,863 --> 00:31:14,131
Bang!

00:31:14,131 --> 00:31:15,998
[laughing]
Mr. Wonderful.

00:31:15,998 --> 00:31:17,733
Not so wonderful
no more, bro.

00:31:26,142 --> 00:31:28,143
NARRATOR: Next into the tank
is an entrepreneur

00:31:28,143 --> 00:31:30,412
with an easy, gourmet way

00:31:30,412 --> 00:31:32,681
to make
a favorite breakfast treat.

00:31:38,652 --> 00:31:41,755
Hello, sharks.
My name is Erica Barrett.

00:31:41,755 --> 00:31:45,559
I'm from Atlanta, Georgia,
and I'm the founder and C.E.O.

00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:48,127
Of Southern culture
artisan foods,

00:31:48,127 --> 00:31:49,862
a breakfast lifestyle brand.

00:31:49,862 --> 00:31:52,765
I'm seeking $100,000
in exchange

00:31:52,765 --> 00:31:56,002
for a 25% equity stake
in my company.

00:31:56,002 --> 00:32:00,038
One morning, I was simply
making breakfast for my husband

00:32:00,038 --> 00:32:02,207
and had to run to the store
to grab ingredients

00:32:02,207 --> 00:32:05,844
to make our all-time favorite,
strawberry pancakes.

00:32:05,844 --> 00:32:09,347
I wanted to use organic flour,
pure cane sugar,

00:32:09,347 --> 00:32:11,349
fresh strawberries,

00:32:11,349 --> 00:32:13,918
and, sharks, what's pancakes
without great vanilla?

00:32:15,553 --> 00:32:18,222
I got to the register,
and my bill was close to $35.

00:32:18,222 --> 00:32:19,790
Stop the madness!

00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,925
I hadn't even
bought the bacon yet.

00:32:21,925 --> 00:32:23,660
And I thought to myself,

00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:26,229
"Why isn't there a quality
flavored pancake-and-waffle mix

00:32:26,229 --> 00:32:27,330
currently on the shelf?"

00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:29,699
So, with no formal
culinary experience,

00:32:29,699 --> 00:32:31,800
I created
our flagship product --

00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,837
shortstacks
pancake &amp; waffle mix.

00:32:34,837 --> 00:32:37,940
We feature unique flavors,
such as banana pudding,

00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:41,542
oatmeal-raisin cookie,
and even bourbon salted pecan.

00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:45,146
We use organic,
all-natural ingredients,

00:32:45,146 --> 00:32:48,116
and because our mixes contain
no powdered dairy,

00:32:48,116 --> 00:32:50,218
I've literally masterminded
a product

00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,719
that's great for all diets.

00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,553
But enough about my breakfasts.

00:32:53,553 --> 00:32:55,355
I have some samples
for you to try.
We're about to eat.

00:32:55,355 --> 00:32:57,791
Yes, breakfast.
Absolutely. Feed us!

00:32:57,791 --> 00:32:58,925
All right.

00:32:58,925 --> 00:33:00,193
Oh, wow.
Here you go, Robert.

00:33:00,193 --> 00:33:01,295
Oh, wow.
Just looking at it...

00:33:01,295 --> 00:33:02,562
Barbara.
Thank you.

00:33:02,562 --> 00:33:03,596
Are these
all the same flavors?

00:33:03,596 --> 00:33:04,830
They have
no carbs at all.

00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,165
Yes, it's our banana pudding,
our best seller.

00:33:06,165 --> 00:33:07,533
CORCORAN: Thank you so much.
HERJAVEC: This is banana?

00:33:07,533 --> 00:33:09,535
Banana-pudding pancake.
It smells fantastic.

00:33:09,535 --> 00:33:10,870
Mr. Wonderful. Here you go.
Banana-pudding pancake.

00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:12,171
JOHN: Thank you.

00:33:12,171 --> 00:33:13,272
Here you go, Mark.

00:33:13,272 --> 00:33:14,539
Yes, Ma'am.

00:33:14,539 --> 00:33:15,907
Mmm.

00:33:15,907 --> 00:33:18,576
Barbara, a moment on the lips,
a lifetime on your hips.

00:33:18,576 --> 00:33:21,179
[chuckles]
It's worth it.

00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:22,514
Mmm!

00:33:22,514 --> 00:33:24,448
Sharks, we've had
quite a bit of success.

00:33:24,448 --> 00:33:26,884
Now I'm ready to take this brand
to the next level.

00:33:26,884 --> 00:33:28,719
There's only one question
I have for you.
This is so good.

00:33:28,719 --> 00:33:29,953
Who's ready to take a bite

00:33:29,953 --> 00:33:32,022
out of the most important meal
of the day?

00:33:32,022 --> 00:33:33,023
Mmm.

00:33:33,023 --> 00:33:34,857
Erica,
tell us about your sales.

00:33:34,857 --> 00:33:36,759
Well,
within our first 12 months,

00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:38,094
we did $100,000 in sales.

00:33:38,094 --> 00:33:39,162
Mmm.

00:33:39,162 --> 00:33:40,797
We had gross profits
of $62,000.

00:33:40,797 --> 00:33:43,299
Where'd you sell
that $100,000?

00:33:43,299 --> 00:33:45,168
Well, Nordstrom picked us up
immediately

00:33:45,168 --> 00:33:46,501
after we went
to our first trade show.

00:33:46,501 --> 00:33:48,737
T.J. Maxx and Marshalls
also picked up our product.

00:33:48,737 --> 00:33:50,372
You've gotten into
some high-end retailers.

00:33:50,372 --> 00:33:51,707
Absolutely.

00:33:51,707 --> 00:33:53,141
And have they reordered
from you?

00:33:53,141 --> 00:33:54,810
Nordstrom, we're working
on an order with them

00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:56,044
for the holiday season.

00:33:56,044 --> 00:33:57,945
They usually do food
around the holidays, like --

00:33:57,945 --> 00:33:59,980
typically, people pick them up
as a gift item.

00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,350
Uh, we do have Whole Foods.

00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:04,518
I do Williams-Sonoma
artisans market once a month.

00:34:04,518 --> 00:34:07,520
Is this very expensive versus
just traditional pancake mix?

00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,988
What does it cost?

00:34:08,988 --> 00:34:11,324
Well, it costs me anywhere
between 99 cents and $1.50

00:34:11,324 --> 00:34:12,525
to make the product.

00:34:12,525 --> 00:34:14,794
It sells for about $7.99.
Great margins.

00:34:14,794 --> 00:34:15,962
How many waffles
does that make?

00:34:15,962 --> 00:34:18,097
12 pancakes
or 4 large waffles.

00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:21,033
That's a very, very high price
for that small quantity.

00:34:21,033 --> 00:34:23,435
Can I see the packaging,
Erica?
Yes. Absolutely.

00:34:23,435 --> 00:34:24,870
So, Erica,
if I'm walking into Whole Foods

00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,572
and I see
four products there...

00:34:26,572 --> 00:34:27,840
Mm-hmm.
...What's the difference

00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,273
between yours
and the other three?

00:34:29,273 --> 00:34:30,808
Why would I pick yours up?

00:34:30,808 --> 00:34:32,643
Well, the first thing
about our product

00:34:32,643 --> 00:34:34,212
is that we use
premium ingredients.

00:34:34,212 --> 00:34:35,880
Well, you've got
the Southern thing going, right?

00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,115
Absolutely.
So that's the whole thing.

00:34:37,115 --> 00:34:39,249
You've kind of created
a little vertical niche, right?

00:34:39,249 --> 00:34:40,650
A niche, absolutely.

00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:41,918
Southern gourmet.

00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,286
Or just a great,
quality pancake

00:34:43,286 --> 00:34:44,721
that's not filled
with chemicals.

00:34:44,721 --> 00:34:46,656
We use real blueberries.

00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:49,192
So, my concern
about growing this business is,

00:34:49,192 --> 00:34:50,393
how do I scale it?

00:34:50,393 --> 00:34:52,094
I don't think
you have a permanent listing

00:34:52,094 --> 00:34:53,896
in any of the stores
you talked to me about.

00:34:53,896 --> 00:34:55,831
Uh, Whole Foods -- we've been
in Whole Foods for a year.

00:34:55,831 --> 00:34:57,099
Okay, how many times
have they reordered?

00:34:57,099 --> 00:34:58,434
It's a local -- it's a local
Whole Foods, correct?

00:34:58,434 --> 00:34:59,802
Regional, yeah.
We're in 12 stores.

00:34:59,802 --> 00:35:01,002
And how many times
have they reordered?

00:35:01,002 --> 00:35:02,170
They reorder every week.

00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:03,838
And why can't you get
a national rollout on that?

00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:05,106
Well, Whole Foods told us

00:35:05,106 --> 00:35:06,608
that they want us to build
a great track record.

00:35:06,608 --> 00:35:08,610
We couldn't get in contact
with the regional buyers,

00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:10,678
so we hustled our way
into every single store.

00:35:10,678 --> 00:35:12,679
We called up every single
team leader and said,

00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:14,348
"I guarantee,
if you purchase this product,

00:35:14,348 --> 00:35:15,616
you're gonna get reorders."

00:35:15,616 --> 00:35:17,451
There hasn't been anything
in my life --

00:35:17,451 --> 00:35:18,919
my mom had me at 16 years old,

00:35:18,919 --> 00:35:20,954
I'm a first-generation
college student --

00:35:20,954 --> 00:35:23,356
that I've set out to achieve
that I have not done.

00:35:23,356 --> 00:35:24,724
I mean, I haven't --
I think I take naps.

00:35:24,724 --> 00:35:26,159
I won't say that I go to sleep.

00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:27,927
But I'm obsessed
with my business,

00:35:27,927 --> 00:35:29,429
because this is
what I'm here to do.

00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:30,430
That's awesome.
Good for you.

00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,798
If this category
takes off,

00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:35,467
why wouldn't you think
the big brands,

00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,135
everybody out there,
would say...
so good.

00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,770
..."I'll just create
my own brand"?

00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:39,971
I think you already have

00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,907
competitors in this category,
don't you?
Well --

00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:43,974
Yeah, there's competitors.
Um, there's --
Well, Kevin --
Kevin's trying to say

00:35:43,974 --> 00:35:46,310
the big boys
are gonna wipe you out,

00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,678
but the big boys already
know about this category.
Yeah.
That's what I'm saying.

00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:48,846
HERJAVEC: Yeah, right?
Absolutely.

00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:50,214
But Kevin
  always says that.

00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:51,282
And I want to know
the answer.

00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:53,017
I think what makes me different
is that,

00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:55,084
you know, traditional
manufacturers have made

00:35:55,084 --> 00:35:58,154
their breakfast products
the same way for 80 to 85 years,

00:35:58,154 --> 00:35:59,255
but people change.

00:35:59,255 --> 00:36:00,757
People have
dietary restrictions.

00:36:00,757 --> 00:36:02,525
People are vegan.
People are lactose-intolerant.

00:36:02,525 --> 00:36:04,194
But I want to hear more
about the ones

00:36:04,194 --> 00:36:05,661
who are currently
in your space,

00:36:05,661 --> 00:36:06,995
the ones
who are making other products.

00:36:06,995 --> 00:36:08,297
Yeah, the premium ones
you compete with --

00:36:08,297 --> 00:36:10,032
do they not make the product
the same way?

00:36:10,032 --> 00:36:11,300
They use powdered dairy.

00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:15,103
So, your claim is
you're the purest of the pure.

00:36:15,103 --> 00:36:16,537
Absolutely.

00:36:16,537 --> 00:36:18,606
So, you've done a remarkable job
in 16 months.

00:36:18,606 --> 00:36:22,043
You're making money.
Your packaging is amazing.

00:36:22,043 --> 00:36:23,711
Why are you here?
What do you need the money for?

00:36:23,711 --> 00:36:25,580
I need to fill orders.
Okay.

00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,414
QVC just sent me an e-mail
this morning.

00:36:27,414 --> 00:36:29,583
They want to pick me up
for their fourth-quarter lineup.

00:36:29,583 --> 00:36:32,252
They believe that we can sell
50,000 to 75,000.

00:36:32,252 --> 00:36:33,386
Let me just
slow you down, there.

00:36:33,386 --> 00:36:35,155
I've had
so many food products on QVC.

00:36:35,155 --> 00:36:37,990
Mm-hmm.
They have sold
wildly successfully.

00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,658
Uh-huh.
And you know what
the problem with them are?

00:36:39,658 --> 00:36:43,028
The margins are so skinny
that you basically break even.

00:36:43,028 --> 00:36:45,331
Mm-hmm.
The way to make money
in the food space,

00:36:45,331 --> 00:36:49,033
which I learned the hard way
over and over and over again,

00:36:49,033 --> 00:36:50,869
is to get into
the big-box stores.

00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:52,170
That's where
the margins are fat.

00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:53,404
And you know
what I've learned?

00:36:53,404 --> 00:36:56,207
I've learned that
boutique businesses like this...

00:36:56,207 --> 00:36:57,876
Uh-huh.
...aren't sold there.

00:36:57,876 --> 00:37:00,077
We were actually approached
by target,

00:37:00,077 --> 00:37:02,613
that wants to start us off
at 50 to 100 test stores.

00:37:02,613 --> 00:37:04,748
You're under a lucky star.
Where do you manufacture this?

00:37:04,748 --> 00:37:06,783
We manufacture the product
ourself.

00:37:06,783 --> 00:37:09,118
What do you mean, "yourself"?
Wait a minute --
you don't have a commer--

00:37:09,118 --> 00:37:10,486
in your own kitchen?
You box it, you make it?
You don't have
a commercial kitchen?

00:37:10,486 --> 00:37:11,888
We have our own facilities --
3,000 square feet.

00:37:11,888 --> 00:37:14,290
Oh.
Why wouldn't you go
to a commercial kitchen?

00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:17,393
Because they could
reduce your costs dramatically.

00:37:17,393 --> 00:37:18,661
I think what we're doing

00:37:18,661 --> 00:37:21,396
that's so unique, Mr. wonderful,
they can't produce this.

00:37:21,396 --> 00:37:22,797
They want to put --
They want to put me in a box.

00:37:22,797 --> 00:37:24,332
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.
Just hear me out on this.

00:37:24,332 --> 00:37:26,601
'cause all of us have food deals
in our portfolios now.

00:37:26,601 --> 00:37:27,769
Okay.

00:37:27,769 --> 00:37:29,538
I have learned that
a commercial co-packer kitchen

00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:30,671
is the only way to go.

00:37:30,671 --> 00:37:32,873
Your costs are reduced
by 30%.

00:37:32,873 --> 00:37:34,074
Okay.

00:37:34,074 --> 00:37:35,809
Erica,
I'll start to simplify things.

00:37:35,809 --> 00:37:37,077
You're amazing,

00:37:37,077 --> 00:37:38,979
but I'm not really
into the gourmet-food business.

00:37:38,979 --> 00:37:40,747
If it's more than $3

00:37:40,747 --> 00:37:42,782
or more than a hot dog
at 7-Eleven,

00:37:42,782 --> 00:37:43,983
that's too much for me,

00:37:43,983 --> 00:37:45,785
and, you know,
it's not my kind of thing,

00:37:45,785 --> 00:37:47,487
so for that reason,
I'm out.

00:37:47,487 --> 00:37:49,422
Thank you.

00:37:49,422 --> 00:37:51,257
But awesome.
Congratulations.
Thank you.

00:37:51,257 --> 00:37:53,992
Erica,
I think that you made

00:37:53,992 --> 00:37:57,896
a really fatal and critical
flaw here today.

00:37:57,896 --> 00:38:00,365
Uh, you didn't give me
enough food.

00:38:00,365 --> 00:38:02,000
[laughter]

00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,801
Unbelievable.
Thank you.

00:38:03,801 --> 00:38:04,802
Unbelievable.

00:38:04,802 --> 00:38:06,003
But here's the one thing
I've learned

00:38:06,003 --> 00:38:08,406
from my food investments.
Yes.

00:38:08,406 --> 00:38:11,876
The food business
is a really tough business.

00:38:11,876 --> 00:38:15,211
I see this
as a high-end niche product,

00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:17,247
but not a big business.

00:38:17,247 --> 00:38:18,648
For that reason, I'm out.

00:38:18,648 --> 00:38:20,183
Thank you.

00:38:20,183 --> 00:38:21,985
Look,
I'm gonna make you an offer,

00:38:21,985 --> 00:38:24,853
but it's gonna have a bunch
of contingencies in it.
Okay.

00:38:24,853 --> 00:38:26,422
Which you're gonna want
to say no to right away.
I haven't heard anyb--
Silence.

00:38:26,422 --> 00:38:29,091
Silence, Barbara, because
you're not making any offer.

00:38:29,091 --> 00:38:31,226
You might as well listen
to where the money is
for the moment, all right?

00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:34,796
You can't do what you want to do
in 3,000 square feet,

00:38:34,796 --> 00:38:38,099
so contingency number 1,
before I give you $100,000,

00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:40,635
is that you're gonna
have to work with a co-packer.

00:38:40,635 --> 00:38:41,703
You're gonna have to.
Okay.

00:38:41,703 --> 00:38:43,004
Secondly, I'm not interested
in any equity.

00:38:43,004 --> 00:38:45,038
I want a dollar a unit.

00:38:45,038 --> 00:38:46,740
Oh! [groans]
Silence.

00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,910
I want a dollar a unit
until I recoup my $100,000,

00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,612
and then
I'll go down to 50 cents --

00:38:51,612 --> 00:38:55,015
the exact same offer
I gave Dani and Tracey
for Wicked Cupcakes.

00:38:55,015 --> 00:38:58,384
They love me now --
Love me, all right?
Okay.

00:38:58,384 --> 00:38:59,619
That's why
I'm called Mr. Wonderful.

00:38:59,619 --> 00:39:02,088
Erica,
what's your cost per unit?

00:39:02,088 --> 00:39:04,757
About anywhere
from 92 cents to $1.50.

00:39:04,757 --> 00:39:06,558
So you're gonna pay Kevin
more than it costs you --
You know what?
No, you don't get it.

00:39:06,558 --> 00:39:08,126
Because when you go
to the co-packer,

00:39:08,126 --> 00:39:09,661
one third of that dollar's
gonna be recouped.

00:39:09,661 --> 00:39:11,296
That doesn't make
any sense.

00:39:11,296 --> 00:39:13,164
She's paying you --
She's paying you more.
I've made an offer.

00:39:13,164 --> 00:39:14,633
If you want to make an offer,
Robert, go ahead and make one.

00:39:14,633 --> 00:39:16,001
She's paying you more than
it costs to make the product.

00:39:16,001 --> 00:39:18,535
You are so lucky you've met me.
You have no idea.

00:39:18,535 --> 00:39:20,838
So you can learn
what not to do.

00:39:20,838 --> 00:39:22,072
Let's hear your offer.

00:39:22,072 --> 00:39:23,907
You -- oh, you're out.
I forgot.

00:39:23,907 --> 00:39:25,409
Now, how about you,
Daymond?

00:39:36,452 --> 00:39:39,855
NARRATOR: Two sharks are out,
Erica has an offer from Kevin,

00:39:39,855 --> 00:39:41,757
and Daymond is on the fence.

00:39:41,757 --> 00:39:42,591
How about you,
Daymond?

00:39:44,693 --> 00:39:46,795
I'll make you an offer.
CUBAN: Thank God.

00:39:46,795 --> 00:39:48,664
And I don't even know
if I really want to
make you an offer.

00:39:48,664 --> 00:39:51,132
I just don't want to see you
in bed with this character.

00:39:51,132 --> 00:39:55,436
But I'll make you
a $100,000 offer for 40%.

00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:57,038
You thief!

00:39:57,038 --> 00:39:58,472
You really do
come in on a broom.

00:39:58,472 --> 00:39:59,806
No, not at all.

00:39:59,806 --> 00:40:01,107
And the reason for that

00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,843
is I don't think you really know
what's ahead of you.

00:40:03,843 --> 00:40:06,413
You haven't dealt with
the stores that don't pay you.

00:40:06,413 --> 00:40:09,616
You haven't dealt with QVC,
where if a customer complains,

00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:11,283
wham --
They slam it back to you

00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:12,751
and they charge you
for the shipping.

00:40:12,751 --> 00:40:13,986
Okay.

00:40:13,986 --> 00:40:16,288
You haven't really gone
to the sophomore year,

00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:19,792
where you are about to have to
overcome tremendous hurdles

00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,859
that almost put every one of my
entrepreneurs out of business.

00:40:21,859 --> 00:40:23,394
Okay.

00:40:23,394 --> 00:40:24,796
It's problem after problem
after problem.

00:40:24,796 --> 00:40:25,963
You know
one of the biggest problems?

00:40:25,963 --> 00:40:27,465
You got to listen to this
every day.

00:40:27,465 --> 00:40:29,067
Which is a whole lot better
than that.

00:40:29,067 --> 00:40:30,568
[laughs]
O'LEARY: So much jealousy here,
you know?

00:40:30,568 --> 00:40:33,370
Erica, so...

00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:36,339
I, uh,
I-I'm one of the only sharks

00:40:36,339 --> 00:40:37,841
without food
in my portfolio,

00:40:37,841 --> 00:40:39,843
so one of my main agendas
this year

00:40:39,843 --> 00:40:42,578
is to put some food
in my portfolio.

00:40:42,578 --> 00:40:44,146
Looks like
you haven't missed many meals.

00:40:44,146 --> 00:40:46,248
[chuckles] No. In my stomach,
they're all there.

00:40:46,248 --> 00:40:48,517
I'm a hard worker.
I'm a hard worker, Daymond.

00:40:48,517 --> 00:40:49,985
You know,
but what I see here

00:40:49,985 --> 00:40:53,688
is that you do have
a horrible offer with Kevin.

00:40:53,688 --> 00:40:56,224
I believe you have a great
potential partner with Barbara,

00:40:56,224 --> 00:40:57,592
so I'm gonna step out.

00:40:57,592 --> 00:41:00,495
What do you think, Erica?
What do you think?

00:41:00,495 --> 00:41:02,230
Barbara,
I would like to counter.

00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,598
Fair.
Is it possible

00:41:03,598 --> 00:41:07,101
we could do 30%
in exchange for the $100,000?

00:41:07,101 --> 00:41:08,235
I'm a hard worker.

00:41:08,235 --> 00:41:10,971
No, I would have to stay firm
with the 40%.

00:41:10,971 --> 00:41:12,239
Oh, come on, Barbara.

00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:13,373
Again, because --
Wow.

00:41:13,373 --> 00:41:15,108
Because I know how much work
is involved in this

00:41:15,108 --> 00:41:16,476
from this point forward.

00:41:16,476 --> 00:41:17,810
35%.

00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:20,046
[clicks tongue]
Afraid not.

00:41:20,046 --> 00:41:21,881
But I want you
to be happy with the deal.
Barbara!

00:41:21,881 --> 00:41:23,850
Have a heart, Barbara.
Come on.
You can make 35%.
I'm a hard worker.

00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,350
Now you know
what evil looks like on Earth.

00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:28,086
No way we can do 35% and just
kind of meet in the middle?

00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:29,221
You savage.

00:41:29,221 --> 00:41:30,956
I mean, a little bit more
than the middle?

00:41:30,956 --> 00:41:32,791
I'll make you
a lot of money, Barbara.

00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:34,960
I'm a hard worker.
I have the right to be here.

00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,594
I've worked so hard.
CUBAN, JOHN, AND HERJAVEC:
Barbara! Barbara!

00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:39,630
Barbara! Barbara! Barbara!

00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,832
BARRETT: Come on, Barbara.
Come on, Barbara!

00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,601
O'LEARY: Erica.
Abandon this madness.

00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:45,102
Do the Mr. Wonderful deal.

00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:46,603
What's 5%?

00:41:46,603 --> 00:41:48,438
Come on, Barbara.
Come on, Barbara!

00:41:48,438 --> 00:41:50,073
Well...38%.

00:41:50,073 --> 00:41:51,541
[laughs]
You got a deal.

00:41:51,541 --> 00:41:54,110
[all cheer]
All right!

00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:56,212
And you don't have a deal,
Mr. Wonderful!

00:41:56,212 --> 00:41:57,479
Yeah!
I'm okay with that.

00:41:57,479 --> 00:41:58,881
Yeah!
CUBAN: Way to go, Erica!

00:41:58,881 --> 00:42:00,549
Whoo, baby!
And I love pancakes.

00:42:00,549 --> 00:42:01,617
Awesome.

00:42:01,617 --> 00:42:03,152
Thank you so much!

00:42:03,152 --> 00:42:04,286
Congratulations, Erica.
Thank you.

00:42:04,286 --> 00:42:05,721
Excellent job.

00:42:05,721 --> 00:42:07,289
CORCORAN: Looking forwar.
To working with you, baby.
Thank you.

00:42:07,289 --> 00:42:09,190
Yes! [laughs]

00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,391
I can't believe it.

00:42:10,391 --> 00:42:11,692
Flattened Mr. Wonderful
like a pancake.

00:42:11,692 --> 00:42:13,194
Take that, Mr. Meanie pants.
[chuckles]

00:42:13,194 --> 00:42:14,297
O'LEARY: I'm okay with it.

00:42:14,297 --> 00:42:15,565
You'll never get your money
out of that --

00:42:15,565 --> 00:42:16,833
ever. ever.
That woman hated you
on sight.

00:42:16,833 --> 00:42:17,867
She loved me.

00:42:17,867 --> 00:42:19,369
I didn't want to give up
that much equity,

00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:20,670
but I trust Barbara,

00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,672
I know that she cares
about my well-being,

00:42:22,672 --> 00:42:25,975
and I know
that I'm gonna be a millionaire.
