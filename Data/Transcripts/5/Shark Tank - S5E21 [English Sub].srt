00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:03,871
NARRATOR:
This is the Shark Tank,
where hopeful entrepreneurs

00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:06,740
get a once-in-a-lifetime chance
to pitch the sharks

00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,142
in hopes
of getting an investment

00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:11,879
to start, grow,
or save their businesses.

00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:14,147
We rent digital books
for $5 a day.

00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:15,682
Are you nuts?

00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:16,817
I have spent
zero Marketing dollars.

00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:18,919
You're just
a Marketing machine.

00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:20,988
NARRATOR: The entrepreneurs
must convince a shark

00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:22,756
to invest the full amount
they're asking for,

00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:25,526
or they'll walk away
with nothing.

00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:28,061
You're saying it's worth
a million dollars?
Absolutely.

00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:29,696
How many
have you sold?
450.

00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,165
You are an inventor,
not an entrepreneur.

00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:33,567
O'LEARY:
You will have no hair.

00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:35,335
You will both look like me
when this is over.

00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:37,137
NARRATOR: If the sharks hear
a great idea...

00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,039
You have
a great business.

00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,975
...They're ready to invest
using their own money.
[ laughter ]

00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:43,477
and they're willing
to fight each other

00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:45,078
for a piece of the action.

00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:46,613
I want 70%.

00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:51,018
70%?! What is wrong
with you?
I have a guy.

00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:53,020
I'm not gonna give you all the
verbal diarrhea you just heard.

00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,354
Cut that crap out.

00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:55,856
Now it got
a little serious here.

00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:57,291
Kevin, come on,
work with me here, Kevin.

00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:58,926
Listen, I'm Mr. Wonderful.
I know everything.

00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:02,930
NARRATOR:
Who are the sharks?

00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:07,167
They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors

00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,670
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.

00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,339
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist

00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:14,775
who turned a $10,000 loan

00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:19,379
into a software business
worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,051
Barbara Corcoran went from
waiting tables in Manhattan

00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:27,321
to building the city's
preeminent real-estate empire.

00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:29,756
Daymond John is
a fashion and branding expert

00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,792
who grew
his homemade clothing line

00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:35,062
into the globally recognized
fashion brand fubu,

00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:38,398
with over $6 billion
in retail sales to date.

00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:41,568
Robert Herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,

00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:44,237
is now a technology mogul

00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:47,975
who sold his first internet
companies for over $350 million.

00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:50,377
And Mark Cuban,

00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:53,714
notorious billionaire
entrepreneur, tech guru,

00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:57,217
and the outspoken owner
of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.

00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:07,127
My name is Pat Crowley.

00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,529
I live in beautiful
Salt Lake city, Utah.

00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:11,198
And I'm the founder
of Chapul.

00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:12,833
[ dog barks ]
As an environmentalist,

00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,469
I'm very concerned about
the future of our planet.

00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,237
And so that's what inspired me
to create

00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,406
an eco-friendly energy bar.

00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:22,709
Right now we work
in a very small kitchen,

00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,778
and we make all the bars
by hand.

00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:27,180
Our product is the first
of its kind in the world.

00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,850
It contains an extremely
healthy, sustainable form
of protein

00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,519
that we like to refer to
as our secret ingredient.

00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:35,555
Hello. Chapul.
This is Pat speaking.

00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:38,692
We're growing every month, and
we can't keep up with demand.

00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,260
We need an investment
from the sharks

00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,495
to increase our production

00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,196
and get the word out
about our amazing product.

00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,766
Yeah, stoked on the new design.
It looks good.

00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:47,567
Starting Chapul
has been a challenge.

00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,736
People have called us crazy

00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:51,071
and said that the idea
would never work.

00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:54,174
Wanting a deal today
goes well beyond my desire

00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,676
for personal success.

00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,911
I want to propel this protein
as the food of the future.

00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,434
My name is Pat Crowley,
from Salt Lake city, Utah.

00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:21,468
My company is Chapul,

00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:24,404
and I'm asking $50,000

00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:26,840
in exchange for 5% equity
in our company.

00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,210
At Chapul, we're changing
the way people think about food,

00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,212
and we do it
with an energy bar.

00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,716
But what separates us from
the thousands of competitors

00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,452
isn't the delicious
medjool dates

00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:40,387
or the organic dark chocolate.

00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:44,057
No, it's our sustainable,
eco-friendly form of protein

00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,292
that goes
into every single bar.

00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:46,593
I'll show you,
but first, a joke.

00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:47,561
[ laughter ]

00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,962
Why are frogs so happy?

00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,497
Uh-oh. Why?
Why?

00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:51,898
Because they eat
what bugs them.

00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,066
[ laughter ]

00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:57,037
And now, so can you
with Chapul cricket bars.

00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:00,540
Oh, you got
to be kidding.

00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,811
Crickets are an extremely
sustainable form of protein.

00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:08,181
They go into each one
of our bars.
Ohh.

00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,550
I-insects are eaten in over half
the countries around the globe,

00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,918
and we think that it's
about time that Americans

00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,320
catch up
with the rest of the world.

00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,188
There is no way
I'm eating that.

00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:18,058
[ laughter ]

00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:20,727
All right, we have
a thailand-themed
coconut ginger lime.

00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:21,928
T-this one?
Yep.

00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,664
Aztec bar is dark chocolate
coffee cayenne.

00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,733
And then we have an all-american
peanut butter and chocolate.

00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,602
Why not? Right?

00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,370
HERJAVEC: They're crickets,
not cockroaches.

00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,705
Correct.

00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:33,039
We actually make a flour
out of the crickets...

00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,275
Thank you.
...So you won't see
any legs or antennae.

00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,610
[ laughter ]

00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,045
You first.

00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,647
Must we eat it?
Sure.

00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:44,050
You're obviously jumping
at the opportunity here

00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,621
to get on board
with a growing global business.

00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,656
So, who wants to join Chapul

00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,992
and help us to feed
the revolution?

00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:55,729
You realize that there's
a huge barrier...

00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,364
Absolutely.

00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:58,632
...Around this product.
Absolutely.

00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,033
Some very large percentage
of consumers

00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,968
are going to be revolted

00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,437
because in our north
American society, they
don't eat insects.

00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,339
I'm not saying it's good or bad.
They just don't.

00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,808
I agree.

00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,209
So, what I'm trying
to determine,

00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:10,777
because I'm trying
to be pragmatic --

00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,612
I'm happy to invest in it
if I can make money.

00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:15,549
Sure. So, we modeled our energy
bar after the sushi industry.

00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:16,950
30 years ago,

00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,719
eating raw fish was completely
repulsive to Americans,

00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,688
and -- until a man by the name
of ichiro mashita

00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:24,958
craftily developed
the California roll,

00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,827
and it was
a gentle introduction.

00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,662
And so, that's what we're doing
with our ener--

00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,497
but that took 20 years.

00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:36,102
CUBAN: Tell --
talk about sales.

00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:39,773
Okay, so, we -- to date,
we have, uh, $50,000 in sales,

00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:41,708
and this year,
we're averaging

00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,611
33% increase
month over month revenue.

00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:47,547
So, over what period of time
would you say $50,000?

00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,082
Oh. That's in
just under a year.

00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,717
Where are you in retail?

00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,919
Natural-foods stores,
bike shops,

00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,021
rock-climbing gyms,
crossfit gyms.

00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,058
You're saying it's worth
a million dollars?
Absolutely.

00:05:58,058 --> 00:05:59,893
Well, why can't I
just get my own crickets
and make my own bars?

00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:01,394
[ laughter ]

00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,762
W-we've spent a lot of time

00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:05,232
developing the supply chain
and working with the FDA,

00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:07,234
and we're the only ones
right now

00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,536
with an insect-based nutritional
product on the Market.

00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,972
Only one that can sell
cricket bars?

00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,273
We're the only ones doing it.

00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:16,209
And one bar -- what do you
sell it for?
$2.99.

00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,511
And to make it?
It costs about a dollar.

00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:19,880
Where do you get
your crickets?

00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,615
Do you grow them yourself?
You catch them?

00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:23,783
We work with -- we work with
a cricket ranch, actually.

00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,485
[ laughter ]
And do you -- do you --

00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,320
They have --
they have little lassos.

00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,258
Little cricket brands.
Where is there
a cricket ranch?

00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:33,026
We've been raising crickets
in the -- in the United States

00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:34,394
for over 100 years,
and it was based on --

00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,795
why?

00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:38,164
Fishing bait,
then it was reptile feed,

00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:41,201
and now that was one of
the reasons we chose crickets,

00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:43,436
is because the infrastructure
is already in place

00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:44,771
to grow them at a large scale.

00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:47,474
Are cricket farms
enclosed?

00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:49,476
They are, and th-that's one
of the environmental benefits,

00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:50,944
is that you can grow them
in a warehouse,

00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:55,215
and it's significantly fewer
acres to grow more protein.

00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:56,783
I'm interested
in how they meet their end.

00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:58,718
You put them in a blender
and they stay to the sides,

00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,887
and they fall down
and get s-- fried?
what happens?

00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:02,656
We freeze them.
That's about the best way to go.

00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:04,024
So it's -- it -- actually,

00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:06,226
their natural metabolism
just slows down.

00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:07,694
[ laughs ]

00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:09,296
Pat, what does this
replace?

00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:12,299
Like, do I eat this
and it's half the size
of a normal bar?

00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:14,501
A bar with other all-natural
and organic ingredients...

00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:17,671
Right.
...Would have half the protein
that that does.

00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:20,874
So, you grind your crickets up
into flour?

00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:23,743
Our name, Chapul, is actually
an Aztec word for "cricket,"

00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,078
'cause they would do
the same thing.

00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:26,546
They would gather crickets,

00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,882
blend them up into a flour,
and make a protein-dense bread.

00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:30,984
Look, I got to tell you.

00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:34,154
I'm -- I'm a pretty brave guy,
but snakes, bugs...

00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:35,689
Not brave enough, huh?
...Freak me right out.

00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:39,259
So there's no way
I'm eating this stuff.

00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:41,428
Thank you. I'm out.

00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,231
O'LEARY: Let's -- let's talk
about the crickets,

00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:47,467
because you didn't tell
the whole cricket story.

00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,570
The truth about crickets
are that they are considered

00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,406
a very important insect in many
countries around the world.

00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,709
CROWLEY: Absolutely.
They're considered lucky.

00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,043
Absolutely.

00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,511
For example, in China,
people think

00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,680
it's incredibly unlucky to kill
one, even accidentally.

00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,248
How do you know that?

00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,517
[ laughter ]
Listen, I'm Mr. Wonderful.
I know everything.

00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,720
It's considered
really bad karma

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,488
to kill them,
let alone freeze them.

00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,623
You got a whole bunch
of crickets right here.

00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:13,026
They're not chirping
'cause they sense danger.

00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,828
I agree. I agree.
That's what they sense.

00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,530
You -- they know they're gonna
die a horrible death with you.

00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,599
I just think, in this case,

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,701
those crickets are telling me
to stay out of this deal.

00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:22,736
I'm out.

00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,706
CORCORAN:
I have to hand it to you.

00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:28,742
I ate that,
and it tastes great.

00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:31,778
I can't tell the difference,
and I'm relieved to find out

00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:33,213
that that crunch
that's on my tongue

00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:34,547
are not the legs
of the crickets

00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:36,549
and all that kind
of goofy stuff.
CUBAN: [ laughs ]

00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:40,186
I think it's gonna be
a heck of a long journey

00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,554
to convince people
that they're gonna love

00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:44,324
to bite into something
with crickets in it.

00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:45,625
I just think it is.

00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:46,993
And whenever there's
a long journey in a business,

00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,762
it means it costs you
more money to get there.

00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:50,130
I'm out.

00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,100
We-we've been very concerted
in our growth right now.

00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,236
We've been intentionally trying
to fly under the radar

00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,805
to some degree,
u-unsuccessfully.

00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:02,375
We've been in national,
international publications
because of this.

00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,144
I can't wrap my head
o-- around this.

00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:08,481
I spend most of my life
trying to get away from
bugs, not eat them.

00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:11,351
[ laughs ]
So, I'm sorry. I'm out.

00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,490
All right, let's do this, Mark.
Let's do this.
CUBAN: Me and you.

00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,460
Okay, Jiminy.
[ laughter ]

00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,129
With the work you've done
to create cricket flour,

00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,632
you're basically saying there's
no competition at all?

00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:27,934
There's a couple
of up-and-coming companies.

00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:31,337
What are they doing
compared to you guys?

00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,073
What are they using
for flour?

00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,307
They don't have
a product yet.

00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,009
They've asked us
to sell it to them.

00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:37,877
And we're --

00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:39,913
we're debating right now whether
we should actually do that.

00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,614
And why --
what's the debate?

00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:44,384
Our business model is not
to invest in infrastructure,

00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:46,486
and so I'd prefer
to purchase the flour

00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:47,754
at some point if I could

00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,489
and just be the brand
behind...

00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,157
Wait.
...The insect movement.

00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,159
I thou-- my understanding was
you own the flour, right?

00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,961
We do. We do.
You created it,
that you're --

00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,329
no one else has
this flour but you.

00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,098
Correct.
From an FDA
perspective...

00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,933
Right.
...You're the only one
that's approved, right?

00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,969
Correct.
So why not have -- go to
these other guys and say,

00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:05,438
"Okay, we'll sell you
our flour at, you know,

00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,574
"three times
what it costs us to make,

00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:10,310
but you have to brand it
'made with Chapul flour'"?

00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,446
That's what -- that's why I say
we're -- we're on the fence,

00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,814
and that's
what we're going to do

00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,149
if we decide
to sell the flour.

00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:19,419
Why wouldn't you do that?
It's a great idea.

00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:21,154
I got to tell you,
the longer you're talking,

00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:23,123
the more I realize you --
you have a great business.

00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,393
But the business
is the flour.

00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,462
The business
is not the energy bar.

00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,997
Come on back in.

00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:43,877
NARRATOR:
Four sharks are out,

00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:46,846
but Robert may have had
a change of heart.

00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:48,815
HERJAVEC: I got to tell you,
the longer you're talking,

00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,050
the more I realize you --
you have a great business.

00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,021
But the business
is the flour.

00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,090
The business
is not the energy bar.

00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,758
The business
is the flour.

00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:01,628
Come on back in.

00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:04,097
We do have a lot
of people saying,

00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:05,331
"When are you gonna sell
the flour,

00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,566
when are you gonna sell
the flour?"

00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:09,235
Right.
one reason I've held off
on doing that

00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,137
is that I'm --
my passion is

00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,606
the sustainability
of our food systems.

00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,441
I love the fact
that you're exclusive.
You have no competition.

00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:17,110
I mean --
yeah, it's great.

00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,045
I'd like to be able
to help you,

00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,747
but it's not worth my time
for 5%.

00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:22,782
Sell me.
I-i'd be happy
to take more money.

00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,484
I could do that for you,
if you want.

00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:25,652
Oh, really?
[ laughter ]

00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:26,753
that is so generous of you,

00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:28,254
but it doesn't work for me,
right?

00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:30,356
Okay.
Sell me.

00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,925
Yeah, okay.

00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:34,861
So, we're projecting $150,000
in sales.

00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,062
I'm -- I'm --
we're past that, right?

00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,631
Okay.
We're negotiating.

00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,466
A-- like I'm saying,
we are at the brink.
We're a-- we're on the whole --

00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:41,901
forget that.
we're negotiating.
he's past all that.

00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,836
We're negotiat--
now it's numbers.
He wants to know --

00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,672
talk money. talk money.
we're negotiating numbers.
CROWLEY:
All right, all right.

00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:47,407
You want me to come back
with another offer?
Yeah.

00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:50,643
You got to make it
cricket sweet for him.

00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,212
Make me an offer.

00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:57,083
All right, so, i-i know
what it takes to lead a team,

00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,452
and I need to maintain
complete ownership,

00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:02,722
so I need to maintain 51%
to lead the team that I have.

00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,824
Okay, so you have
other investors?

00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:07,393
Not investors, but, uh,
employees -- founders.

00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,394
Foun-- that have equity?
That have equity.

00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,162
Okay, so --
I have 80%.

00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:10,530
You have 80%?
I have 80%.

00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,498
Right.

00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,902
So...Let's do 10%.

00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,071
Make me an offer.

00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:21,975
This is going to be...
Make me an offer.

00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:25,278
...A $100 million business
in the next 5 years.

00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:26,479
With any luck at all,

00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,147
you might show a profit
before you're dead.

00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:34,821
15% I could do, Mark.

00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:35,922
Are you nuts?

00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:41,961
Pat, I'll give you
the $50,000 for 20%.

00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:47,033
Ooh, somebody
jumped back in.

00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,010
I'll do it
for the 15%.

00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,412
15%?
Yep.

00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:01,314
Let's do this.
Let's do this, Mark.
Let's go make
some chirping money.

00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:02,682
Appreciate it, buddy.
Thank you very much.

00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:04,584
He snatched that one
from you.

CUBAN:
Let's eat some crickets.
yeah, let's eat
some crickets.

00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:07,887
Good job, man.
Thank you very much.

00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,822
Robert, here's
your consolation prize.

00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,357
Oh, don't come near me.
[ laughter ]

00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,026
oh, my God.

00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:15,995
CROWLEY: I definitely gave away
more equity than I wanted,

00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,064
but now that Mark
is one of our partners,

00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:20,933
we can't be more excited to just
take this to the next level

00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:22,402
and really feed the revolution.

00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:24,170
You cost me 5%.

00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,105
I'm not gonna let you
live that down. I'm
gonna get that back.

00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:27,974
You were trying to get 20%
out of him?
Yeah.

00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,442
Yeah, but Robert ruined that
for you.

00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:32,478

They are so ugly.

NARRATOR:
This season, we watched

00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:41,220
Eric Child and Spencer Quinn

00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,156
strike a deal
with Lori Greiner

00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:46,159
for their multi-purpose
repair product, Fiberfix.

00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,093
Lori...

00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:49,495
You have a deal.
Good.

00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,997
NARRATOR: Let's see
what they're up to now.

00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,067
[ train whistle blows ]

00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,501
Prior to "Shark Tank,"

00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,670
we had only done
about $300,000 in sales.

00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,340
But since "Shark Tank,"
in only three months,

00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,009
we've done almost $6 million
in sales nationwide.

00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,410
Look at that.
10,000 units.

00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,713
One of the reasons we decided
to partner with Lori

00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:08,214
is because we knew
she brought

00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,416
a ton of expertise
in home shopping.

00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,752
Here we go. Look at this.
That was fiberfix.

00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:14,554
Unbelievably strong,
this stuff.

00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:16,389
QUINN: The day
after "Shark Tank" aired,

00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:17,790
we were able to get
into one

00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,726
of the most coveted positions
on QVC.

00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:23,363
We have now taken orders
for over 10,000 kits.
[ laughs ]

00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,698
and we were able to sell
through 45,000 rolls of fiberfix

00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,967
in only 10 minutes.

00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,836
We have sold out of everything
that we brought in.

00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:32,171
Hey, we got to get 2,000 boxes
out today.

00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,406
Can we do it?

00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:34,807
[ cheering ]
All right! Let's do it!

00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,609
CHILD: We've had so much demand
since "Shark Tank"

00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:39,679
that we've had to move into
this 8,200-square-foot facility,

00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,014
and we now have
a dedicated factory

00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,450
that's producing over 10,000
rolls of fiberfix every day.

00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,719
Fiberfix can now
be found in Home Depot,

00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,854
ace hardware,
true value,

00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:49,989
and many other retailers
nationwide.

00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,691
We like to think
that we're continuing

00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:53,593
the tradition
of American innovation.

00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:55,628
It's awesome to be able
to create jobs

00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:58,131
and provide a living wage
for lots of employees.

00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:00,500
Our most exciting news yet

00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,802
is the deal that Lori helped us
put together with Lowe's.

00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:06,139
We're rolling out to all
1,800 stores nationwide.

00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:07,273
So, do you all love it?

00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:08,708
Hey, look who's here.
Hey!

00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,043
GREINER: I've never seen
a product like this one.

00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,612
There's nothing else
out there like it.

00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:15,214
This is mandatory for everybody
to have in their home.

00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:18,117
I think fiberfix
is going to be enormous.

00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:20,186
CHILD: Doing our deal with Lori
has collapsed

00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:22,488
three to five years of growth
to just a few months.

00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:23,823
It's been an amazing ride
so far,

00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:25,591
and we're excited to see
what the future holds.

00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:29,162
ALL: Fiberfix it! Whoo!

00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:39,906
NARRATOR:
Next up is a product

00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:41,207
that solves
an alarming security issue

00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:43,843
every homeowner
should know about.

00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:53,085
Hello, sharks.
My name is Bryan White.

00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:55,588
And my company is
the Garage Door Lock.

00:15:55,588 --> 00:16:00,693
And I'm here seeking $275,000
for 30% equity in my company.

00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:04,931
There!

00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:07,133
It just happened.

00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,669
There's a home invasion every
15 seconds in this country.

00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,370
So, think about it.

00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,939
What's the biggest door
in your house,

00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:14,607
and which is the only door
you never lock?

00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:16,442
The garage door.

00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,511
Most people never give it
a second thought

00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:20,146
because most people
don't realize

00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:23,149
how easy it is
for thieves to break in.

00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,750
There!
It just happened again.

00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,254
The door is open in seconds,
and all you're left with are

00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:30,490
some old, rusty paint cans
and oil stains on the floor.

00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,993
The Garage Door Lock
is the answer.

00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,429
It's a steel deadbolt
that automatically
locks your garage door

00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:39,665
to protect your belongings
and to give you peace of mind.

00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,868
The Garage Door Lock
is universal.

00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:43,536
It works with all openers
on any door.

00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:45,204
We lock every other door
in our home.

00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:47,206
Why leave
the largest one unlocked?

00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:48,541
So, come on, sharks,

00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,209
let's close the deal
and lock this thing up.

00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,446
Bryan, my garage door
is locked all the time.

00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:55,748
No, your garage door is
not locked all the time.
That's a facade.

00:16:56,616 --> 00:17:00,119
You're telling me that
my traditional garage door,

00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,554
that I use my clicker on --

00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:02,822
I have for years --
that's not safe?

00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:03,990
Somebody can just walk
in there,

00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,258
open it up
just like this thief did?

00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:07,793
Correct.
Wow.

00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,996
If you could imagine breaking
into a locked vehicle

00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:12,565
with a slim Jim and -- or a coat
hanger, it's very similar.

00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:14,133
Wow.

00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:16,002
You know that guy that --
from the hood that I'm
always talking about?

00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:18,004
[ laughter ]
CUBAN: Yep. That's --
there he is.

00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:19,739
Hey, that's him
right there.

00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:21,374
O'LEARY: Okay, so --
HERJAVEC: So, how does
your product work, Bryan?

00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,575
How -- how do we --
how do we solve

00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:24,110
this horrific problem
that is all over America?

00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,278
Will it actually
stop the madness?

00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:26,279
Stop the madness.

00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,613
The way it works is when you --

00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,348
when you push your remote
that comes with the lock kit,

00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:30,983
the lock will unlock,

00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,552
then you would --
you would close it,

00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,487
and it would lock
a-automatically.

00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:36,589
O'LEARY: So, hang on.

00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:38,591
Is this an add-on that I put on
to my existing garage door?

00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:40,660
Yes, you don't need
to replace --

00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,194
but why -- but why doesn't
the manufacturer

00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:43,229
that sold me the door
in the first place

00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,497
just do the same thing?

00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:47,333
Why do I -- why are they selling
me a crappy garage door?

00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,936
WHITE: They're all sold,
they're all made the same way.

00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:51,437
Do you install it yourself?

00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,105
It's a do-it-yourself product.

00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,875
It comes with
all the hardware needed and
the instructions to do it.

00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,310
And how long
does it take to install?

00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,678
WHITE:
For me, about 45 minutes,

00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:00,179
but it would take somebody
that's never done one before

00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,081
probably about a couple hours.

00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,283
And what do you sell it for?

00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,719
We're selling them now
for $249.95.

00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,155
How many have you sold?
Total to date -- 450...

00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:12,458
...For about $112,000.

00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,095
And where are you
selling them at?

00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,330
Just online.

00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,831
We have ze-- I have spent
zero Marketing dollars.

00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:19,999
I've just put up the webs--

00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:21,334
how do people find --
how are people finding you?

00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:22,702
Usually after they
get broken in.

00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:24,337
Bryan, here's the biggest
problem with your product.

00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:27,340
How are you gonna educate
the Market for this?

00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,274
Well, that's --
that's part --

00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,843
that's why he's here.
yeah. exactly.

00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,912
That's what I was depending
on you guys for. I -- you know?

00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:35,147
That's not
your strength, huh?
Hmm.

00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,749
Oh, that's
a tough one there.

00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:37,683
So, you know the problem for --

00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:38,985
I've taken it this far.

00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:40,119
Have you done a video
for YouTube or anything?

00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,787
Yes, I have
a YouTube video.

00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,255
And have you gotten
much response to it?

00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:47,093
Yes. Actually,
the sales spiked in 2010
when that video went up.

00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:49,829
And did you do
a follow-up?
No.

00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:52,431
You're just
a Marketing machine.
[ laughter ]

00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,300
O'LEARY:
So, Bryan, if I invest --
I love the honesty,
though.

00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,135
JOHN: Bryan, can you --
I love the honesty.

00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,970
I can't help it.
It's who I am.
Bryan, Bryan,
Bryan, since you said --

00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,805
Bryan, would you like to go
to retail with this?
yes.

00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,307
But do you know anything
about that? What's your history?

00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:05,111
Well, I have invented a --
you ever been parasailing,

00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:07,079
or you know
what parasailing is?
yes.

00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,581
I invented the device
that launches parasails

00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:09,915
from a boat
and pulls it back in.

00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:12,051
But I see those
all around the world.
Right.

00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:14,487
Well, that patent's long
expired. That was back in 1979.

00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,055
Were you broken in?
Is this how you invented --

00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:17,590
that's how I came up --
yeah.

00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,026
I was living in a condominium
where there were, uh --

00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:22,161
the garages were separate
from the residence.

00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,430
People were going out and buying
the -- you know, the padlocks.

00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,032
And they would have to go out,
unlock the door,

00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,434
open the door, get in the car,
back it out.

00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:30,736
How much money did you put into
the business to get it started?

00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:33,873
We've got $250,000
into this,

00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:35,941
not including
the patent money.

00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,443
O'LEARY:
You're a -- you've built a
better mousetrap. Get that.

00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:39,045
Now, I don't know
how to sell it

00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:41,547
unless I want to come and work
with you in your garage

00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,182
and do all
the Marketing myself.

00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,251
If you could get me in front
of the -- the right people

00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:47,153
and get in the big-box stores,
I will do the work.

00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:49,422
I'm probably the most --
hardest-working guy you
ever met.

00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:52,658
And I do have
a confidential agreement

00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:55,494
to be introduced

00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:58,431
to a large garage-door
manufacturing company.

00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:01,767
What do you mean, to be
introduced to them?

00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,569
I have
a guaranteed introduction.

00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:06,305
[ chuckles ]
JOHN: Huh?

00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:07,506
That's one
we've never heard of.

00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,341
Yeah, I've never heard that.
What does that mean?

00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,277
WHITE: That means the --
the person I'm working with

00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:14,013
is very good friends
with the owner

00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:15,648
of a major garage-door
manufacturer.

00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:18,984
Oh.
You know, you got to be careful
with stuff like that.

00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:20,653
Anybody who's charging you
for introduction

00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:22,888
or stuff like that is
usually, uh...
a crook.

00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,323
Yeah, so you've got to be
careful with that.

00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,692
Can I tell you what you're
missing in this deal?

00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,428
The most important ingredient.
You're missing an entrepreneur.

00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:33,399
I am sure you are
probably the nicest person

00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,700
we've ever met, period.

00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,768
Thank you.

00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:37,636
However --
but still,
she'll insult you.

00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,572
However, I can't
even imagine you

00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,140
walking into a big-box store,

00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,076
I can't imagine you tracking
down billing, getting paid,

00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,611
even if you had the sale.

00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:48,414
You are an inventor,
not an entrepreneur.

00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:51,350
I don't think you're gonna have
a easy time at all

00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,818
getting people to invest

00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:54,987
until you have
a great sales front

00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:58,090
linked with your arm, standing
right there with you.

00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,826
Um, that's what I was hoping
to get here.

00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:03,763
Okay, well, until you get that,
I'm out.

00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:07,500
Well, uh, you know,
it didn't take me long

00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,935
for you to demonstrate how easy
and shock you into seeing...

00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,137
CORCORAN: Terrific product,
no doubt.

00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:12,304
...How valuable the product is,

00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,507
so I don't know that it's
that hard to do.

00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:17,910
The business is worthless
until the product is sold.

00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,814
Bryan, I'm not gonna give you
all the verbal diarrhea

00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:23,816
you just heard
from Barbara.
that's not --
cut that crap out.

00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:26,252
I'm just going to say that
this opportu--
a little respect here.

00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:28,320
Having said all that,
I got to get a door lock.

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,156
There's no question about it.

00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:32,091
So I'll probably go online
and buy one from you

00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:33,759
because you've scared
the pants off me.

00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,094
Yeah, me too.

00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:36,762
But the opportunity is
not evident to me

00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:39,565
on how I give you $275,000
and how I make a lot back

00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:41,367
because you're missing
so much.

00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:42,668
I'm out.

00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:45,905
I'm sorry to hear that.
Thank you.

00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:51,844
I just know that there's
a huge Market.

00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:54,280
There's $1.3 billion spent
on steel garage doors.

00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,681
Bryan, I don't think
anybody's contesting

00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:56,882
that there's
a huge Market there.

00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:59,285
But you don't have
the infrastructure in place

00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:00,252
for a salesperson,

00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:01,854
and that changes
the economics,

00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:03,055
and you're looking for us
to do it.

00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:05,558
I'm not in a position
to do that,

00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:07,493
and so, for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,762
Thank you, Mark.

00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:18,637
JOHN: I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:20,739
I'm gonna make you an offer.

00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:22,441
It's a Kevin O'Leary play.

00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:25,311
It's put this
in my licensing division

00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:27,580
and see if we
can get somebody to...

00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,981
Oh, grasshopper,
you've learned.

00:22:28,981 --> 00:22:31,016
...Go out there
and, uh, do something.

00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,618
I think that America needs
to know

00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:34,753
how to protect themselves,
needs to help themselves.

00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:36,455
Every homeowner should know
about this.

00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:40,726
I'll give you $275,000
for 40%,

00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:42,628
but it's contingent on us
finding a license.

00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:47,266
You should say yes.

00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:48,534
S-sorry. Hang on.

00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:53,038
What was the offer?

00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,675
$275,000 for 40%,

00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:58,944
and my only intention
is to license it.

00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:02,181
Here's the offer
I'll make you.

00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:04,416
$275,000,

00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:08,654
and I want to --
in exchange for 70%.

00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,558
70%?!

00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:13,826
That's my offer.

00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:16,495
What is wrong with you?

00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:18,864
I have a guy who --
who does this

00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:20,599
and sells products
like this.

00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:23,102
I have absolutely no doubt
in my mind

00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:26,138
I could put you in front
of those buyers immediately.

00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:28,807
We have the same exact offers
on the table,

00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:31,744
except for Robert,
the greedy savage he is,

00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:34,546
he wants to take 70%.

00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:36,448
Yeah, Bryan, my --
my friend,

00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:39,118
he's the largest manufacturer
of car covers

00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:40,252
in North America.

00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,255
Robert may have
a closer relationship

00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,957
with this one outlet.

00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:46,992
I'm gonna go
after five or six.

00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:49,561
Robert wants
to take 70%.

00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:52,064
Those offers are usually done
in Nigeria and Kuwait

00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,365
and things of that nature,

00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,034
and I want to take...

00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:56,535
[ laughs ]
Via e-mail, right?

00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:57,670
...Yeah -- 40%.

00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:04,043
O'LEARY: Okay, Bryan, we've got
two offers on the table.

00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:06,745
You'll get your $275,000
from Daymond.

00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:09,448
He wants 40% of the equity,
contingent on licensing it

00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,451
to a manufacturer that solves
your Marketing problem.

00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,154
Robert has a special friend
that knows this industry
inside out.

00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:17,389
There's no contingency,

00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:21,460
but he wants 70%
of any revenue stream.

00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,329
You keep 30%. He gets 70%.

00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:25,164
He'll solve your Marketing and
manufacturing problems also.

00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:26,432
But that's a crime.

00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:29,535
What are you going to do?

00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:42,815
Daymond, would you counter
at 35%?

00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:50,189
You got a deal.
Done.

00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:52,057
You got a deal.
Robert, I really like you.

00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:54,026
Don't talk to him.
He's a crook.
HERJAVEC:
Bryan, I hate you!

00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:55,995
[ laughter ]
I hate you!

00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:57,596
I had no idea.

00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:58,530
Bryan, get the hell
out of here!

00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,431
Thank you.
I'm sorry, Robert.

00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:00,733
I hate you!
I really like you.

00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:02,434
I like him better.
Oh!

00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,670
Ouch!
There goes a good man.

00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,739
Robert, I never heard
an offer from -- from
you like that before.

00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:08,540
What happened to you?
It's a lot of work.

00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,442
I do know
it's a lot of work.
It's a lot of work
to get this done.

00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:11,910
Oh, whoa. Yeah.

00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,714
WHITE: I struck a deal
with a millionaire.

00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:17,516
It's gonna get my product
out there.

00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:18,717
It just feels fantastic.

00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:20,386
I can't even tell you
how I feel.

00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:33,999
NARRATOR: Next into the tank is
a quick fix to a daily problem.

00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,576
Hi, sharks.
My name is Max Valverde.

00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:46,311
I'm from Boston, Massachusetts,

00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,447
and I'm the creator
of Morninghead.

00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:49,615
Of what?

00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:50,749
Morninghead.

00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:52,317
Ah.
Ah. Of course.

00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:54,353
I'm seeking $25,000

00:25:54,353 --> 00:25:55,921
in exchange for 20% equity
in my company.

00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:58,357
I try to exercise
every day after work.

00:25:58,357 --> 00:26:00,325
I love mountain biking,
rock climbing,

00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:01,560
basketball, you name it.

00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,196
After I get a good sweat going,
I come home,

00:26:04,196 --> 00:26:06,065
hit the shower,
and hit the hay.

00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:08,367
The next morning,
I'm still totally clean,

00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:09,735
but my bed head is insane.

00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,804
And the last thing I want to do
is take another shower.

00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:14,807
For years, I tried wetting
my hair in the sink.

00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:15,974
Water gets everywhere,

00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:17,976
and you never really get
the back of your head.

00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:21,447
Morninghead solves this problem
once and for all.

00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:23,582
It's a reusable, washable cap

00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,784
with a super-absorbent material
on the inside.

00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:30,189
Simply add water to it.
Allow that water to absorb.

00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:31,924
Put it on your head.

00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,892
Once it's on your head, you rub
it around for a few seconds.

00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:36,161
Let that water absorb
into your hair.

00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:38,430
No water dripping
down your neck, mind you,

00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,032
so you can do it anywhere,

00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:41,533
even if you're
fully clothed.
[ laughs ]

00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,769
and seconds later,
your hair is completely wet.

00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:46,305
No mess. Bed head's gone.

00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:48,540
You can then style your hair
as you normally would,

00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,442
as if you just toweled off
after a shower.

00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,579
Max, what do you
think the chances are I'm
going to invest in that?

00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:55,047
[ laughter ]

00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:56,682
Kevin, Daymond, Daymond, Kevin,
you guys are the lucky ones.

00:26:56,682 --> 00:26:59,051
No hair, no problem,
but for the rest of us,

00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:01,353
basically anyone
who's ever had bed head

00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:03,689
without the need or the time
for a shower

00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:05,791
has a real use
for this product.

00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,626
Our internet popularity

00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,361
coupled with your capital
and expertise

00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:11,897
ensures Morninghead is poised
to catch a viral wave,

00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:14,266
create a paradigm shift
in morning grooming,

00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:15,167
and in 12 months' time...
[ laughter ]

00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:16,568
...one or more of you

00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:19,505
will be able to tell friends
your best move of this year

00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:21,406
was getting Morninghead.

00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:25,210
Here we go.
This is our first run.

00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,346
I designed all this,
basically.
Thank you.

00:27:29,615 --> 00:27:32,084
This is a diaper
you put on your head.

00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:33,252
Hey, it works.
O'LEARY: It's a shower cap.

00:27:33,252 --> 00:27:34,887
I think that's
the challenge.
It's a diaper.

00:27:34,887 --> 00:27:36,155
Right. But check this.

00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:38,924
We'd be lucky if we sold
10, 20, 100 of these things.

00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:41,026
We've sold 7,000
in over 42 countries.

00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:42,828
This is a big product.
What?

00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:44,363
Now it got
a little serious here.

00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:46,398
You sold 7,000
of them?

00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:48,433
Exactly.
For how much?

00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:49,535
So, right now they're --

00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:51,270
we're selling them
for $7.99 on our website.

00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:54,173
Our cost is $1.19. We're gonna
get that closer to $1.

00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,340
The margin is sick.

00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,109
What were your total sales
to date?

00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:58,710
To date -- $36,000.

00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,246
How long have you been
in business?
18 months.

00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:02,514
JOHN: Why do you need
the money?

00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,316
What's the $25,000
gonna do for you?

00:28:04,316 --> 00:28:05,717
Here's why we need the money.

00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:07,920
If I can purchase
in a slightly larger bracket,

00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,589
we'll be able to get the cost
from $1.19 down closer to $1.

00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,425
And how do your customers
find you?

00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:15,561
What I've done
is I've made my own videos.

00:28:15,561 --> 00:28:18,430
We -- we've had 165,000 views
on our website.

00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:21,133
To me, that says for every 1,000
people who sees our video,

00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:26,171
sees our Marketing message,
we are getting 34 caps sold.

00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:27,839
You're not living
off Morninghead, are you?

00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,041
No.
What else
do you do?

00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:31,276
So, I'm
a mechanical engineer.

00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,245
I have a list of inventions,
a list of stuff I want to do.

00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:34,746
What else you got?
This sucks.

00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:37,316
No -- Kevin, think back
to after college

00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:39,284
when you had those big --
that big mop of hair.

00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:40,519
Yeah.

00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:42,187
You never wet your hair
in the sink? You never --

00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:44,856
i-i actually did, and I remember
those days fondly.
he never had hair.

00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:48,193
But it -- I just can't see
this as a big business, max.

00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:50,662
This is basically
a shower cap.

00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:52,397
[ laughs ]
VALVERDE: It is. It is.

00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,832
With a --
with a bumper sticker on it.

00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:55,767
But we've sold 7,000 units
in over 42 countries.

00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:56,969
No, I get it, max.

00:28:56,969 --> 00:29:00,872
It's just -- you know,
it's a tchotchke.

00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:02,274
And you're a great sales guy.

00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:03,742
Yeah.
What a waste of you.

00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,744
And so I say you take
some of the other ideas --

00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,446
what are your other ideas, max?
w-what's next?

00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:10,048
Mark, I learned long ago --
about five years ago, I had --

00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:11,850
you know, I have pages
of inventions.

00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,585
I was working on five,
six things at a time.

00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,554
I really need to devote time
to one thing at a time.

00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:17,256
And you've done
a great job of this.

00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:18,924
I -- this is
an easy-money product.

00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:21,260
It's good.
It's a big hit.

00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,528
But it's not enormous,
and it's not gonna go anywhere.

00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:26,431
You're not gonna be, you know,
on the Forbes 400 --

00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,400
"the inventor of Morninghead,

00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,936
$6.7 billion net worth,"
right? there's got --

00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,338
"retail locations everywhere."
[ laughter ]

00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:34,706
VALVERDE: I see what you're
saying, but that's why

00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:36,642
I'm not coming in here for
a million-dollar valuation.

00:29:36,642 --> 00:29:37,809
We're pricing at --

00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:40,078
based on our -- our last
quarter's run rate --

00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:41,747
look, I -- I get it.
I love it.

00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:42,614
It's hysterical.

00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,949
If you had told me you have

00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:45,717
three different
follow-up products,

00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:47,286
I'd invest
in a heartbeat.

00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:51,590
But you don't.
For that reason, I'm out.

00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,892
Well, h-here's the thing,
Mark, is that we are --

00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:56,795
our -- our users
have been writing in
asking for bulk orders.

00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:57,963
Users are asking --
bulk orders?

00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:58,930
Yes.
Well, why wouldn't you
sell it to them?

00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,599
O'LEARY: Like, max --
no, we are.

00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,100
We're selling --
what for?

00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,235
Because they're disposable.

00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:05,003
They -- they only last
about six months.

00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:06,238
So people are writing in --
what? Oh, no.

00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:08,040
So they want five years' worth
of Morninghead?

00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,642
Yes, they do,
and they're asking for
a subscription-based program.

00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,644
A subscription-based
program?

00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,012
[ laughter ]

00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:16,982
$2 a month. $2 a month.
Oh!

00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:19,584
Max, I have
some good news for you.

00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:22,587
Enough. Don't laugh too hard
at the guy.

00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:23,722
Ah.

00:30:23,722 --> 00:30:27,025
Let me speak up.
May I speak up? All right.

00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:29,394
So, max, let me ask you
something. Let me --
wait. No, no.
I'm speaking.

00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:31,229
Oh, sorry.
Pipe down, little man.
Barbara's speaking,
young Daymond.

00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:32,798
Please.
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:34,933
I'm your perfect customer,
honest to God,

00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:36,968
because I wash my hair
every other day,

00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,737
and it's true --
the second day,

00:30:38,737 --> 00:30:39,871
if you shower at night,

00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:41,340
your hair looks terrible.
right.

00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,507
But bad news for you

00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,476
is I discovered
another solution.

00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:46,311
It's called
a damp face cloth.

00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:49,915
I rub it around,
and I have perfect hair.

00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:53,652
It's totally unnecessary.
I'm out.

00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:55,487
Here's the thing, Barbara.

00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:56,722
You of anyone
should know that --

00:30:56,722 --> 00:30:58,790
that a funny name
and a gimmick can go a long way

00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,992
with your "pigtails"
and with --
no, this gimmick is --

00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:03,095
yeah, this gimmick is
not gonna go too far.

00:31:03,095 --> 00:31:06,965
Max, I just don't see the vision
for this product. I'm out.

00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:09,935
Max, it's not
a scalable business for me.

00:31:09,935 --> 00:31:12,437
It's an item, and I think
you're gonna make a good
amount of money

00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:14,373
and have some fun with it,
but I can't help you here.

00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:15,607
I'm out.

00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:18,477
Kevin, come on,
work with me here, Kevin.

00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:19,978
No, no, no.

00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:21,279
You like --
this -- no,
this -- this --

00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,214
this company --
high growth potential.

00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:23,315
You'll get
your $25,000 back.

00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:24,750
Max, max.
No problem.

00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,885
This qualifies
as poo-poo on a stick.

00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,820
I'm out. I'm out.

00:31:30,856 --> 00:31:32,357
Good luck.
Good luck, max.
Good luck.
Thank you.

00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:34,292
Good luck to you guys.
Thank you very much.

00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:36,795
Let's try it out.

00:31:36,795 --> 00:31:38,964
Wait. There's merit
in the product.

00:31:38,964 --> 00:31:40,732
[ laughs ]

00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,234
VALVERDE:
All laughing aside,

00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:43,969
Morninghead is
a serious business,

00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:45,704
and contrary to what
the sharks are saying,

00:31:45,704 --> 00:31:47,706
Morninghead is going to be
a million-dollar company.

00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:04,856
NARRATOR: Next up is
an affordable study solution

00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,491
for starving students.

00:32:12,197 --> 00:32:14,166
Hey, sharks.
My name is Kasey gandham.

00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:15,267
And I'm Mike Shannon.

00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:16,835
We're from Chicago,
Illinois,

00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:19,004
and our company
is packback books.

00:32:19,004 --> 00:32:21,373
We're seeking $200,000

00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:24,376
in exchange for 10% equity
in our company.

00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:26,545
Sharks, let me ask
you all a question.

00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:29,581
Do you remember what it was like
to be a college student?

00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:32,651
Well, sharks, there's been
a serious epidemic on the rise

00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:34,753
since your college days,
and it's the cost of textbooks.

00:32:34,753 --> 00:32:37,255
Hey, Mark, did you know

00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:39,591
that since the time when you
hung up your Hoosier hat,

00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:43,695
textbook prices
have risen 812%?

00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:46,531
In fact, the students
are even dropping out
of their courses

00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:48,099
in order to avoid
the book cost.

00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:50,569
They are compromising
their education.

00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:53,271
But that's not the worst
that can happen.

00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:54,573
Take a look at this.

00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:56,174
When you buy textbooks
  from the book store,

00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:57,375
you end up broke.
[ groans ]

00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:58,910
when you end up broke,
  you have to get a job

00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,712
cleaning windows
  on campus.

00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:02,747
When you clean windows
  on campus, you look in and see

00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:05,484
parts of your professor
  you wish you hadn't.
  huh? aah!

00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,853
When you see things
  you wish you hadn't, you
  fall off a 10-story building.

00:33:07,853 --> 00:33:10,088
[ groans ]
  when you fall off
  a 10-story building,

00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:11,590
You wind up
  in a full-body cast

00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,525
and can't lug
  your expensive books to class.

00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:15,627
When you can't lug
  your expensive books to class,

00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:17,229
you sadly flunk
  out of college.
  oh, no!

00:33:17,229 --> 00:33:18,563
And when you flunk
  out of college,

00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:20,098
you end up back in
  your mom's basement...

00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:22,367
Hi!
  ...Eating cookies
  on the couch in a onesie.

00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:25,170
[ groans ]
  don't end up eating cookies
  on the couch in a onesie.

00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,638
Use packback books.

00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:28,573
Clever.

00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:30,208
SHANNON:
Packback books is a website

00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:33,211
offering pay-per-use access
to digital textbooks.

00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:37,182
A student simply logs in,
selects the book they need,

00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:41,820
and bam, they have
immediate, affordable
access to their books.

00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,488
Our e-textbooks
are fully equipped

00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:45,390
with highlighting
and note-taking capabilities,

00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:48,693
and we're already working with
major U.S. textbook publishers

00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,663
to bring the packback service
to students nationwide.

00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:55,333
Sharks, who's ready to pack
smart with packback books?

00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,469
O'LEARY: You're walking
right into my space here.

00:33:57,469 --> 00:33:59,237
Let's say
I'm Houghton Mifflin,

00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:02,040
and I'm doing curriculum books
for the New York Market.

00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,309
I already offer them
in a digital format.

00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:07,345
Are you saying you're
just letting me lease
the digital format?

00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:08,413
Absolutely.

00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:11,550
So, the way
our service works --

00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,585
let's say Daymond is
a sophomore in college.

00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:16,254
He's fed up. Freshman year,
he spent $1,200 on new books.

00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:18,156
He realized he didn't use
half of them

00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:19,724
enough for
the purchase price.

00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:23,295
We allow Daymond to hold off
on buying anything.

00:34:23,295 --> 00:34:26,298
Rent for a day at a time
at $5 or less,

00:34:26,298 --> 00:34:28,133
as is a quiz
or a homework assignment.

00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:29,734
So, Mike,
I'm going to assume that,

00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,636
if you're in this business,
you have a deal

00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:34,172
with the largest publishers
in that space.
that's right.

00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:36,241
We have a deal with one
of the biggest four.
One of the largest.

00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,643
What percentage of the books
would that cover?

00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:40,412
So, it's roughly anywhere
from 25% to 30%,

00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,614
depending on your --
on your average campus.

00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:44,449
And if it works,
you'll get the other ones.
Right, so --

00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:46,184
but why wouldn't one
of the big guys just do this?

00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:48,253
It's their -- it's their
property you're renting
out anyway.

00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:50,522
Yes. E-textbooks
are being sold.

00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:52,357
They've been around
in the Marketplace for
around eight years, but --

00:34:52,357 --> 00:34:53,458
HERJAVEC:
But they're only being sold.

00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:54,826
They're being rented
for a semester

00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:58,396
at approximately
$100 to $150 per book. now --

00:34:58,396 --> 00:34:59,698
but you're doing it
differently --

00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:00,932
the only difference being
you're doing it by the day.

00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,567
We're introducing
a micro-transaction into this --

00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,069
you're -- you're pay-per-view.

00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:05,303
Yeah, we're pay-per--
pay-per-use.
Yeah, so --

00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:08,173
what's a typical price
for a textbook?

00:35:08,173 --> 00:35:10,408
Your new book
could be $150.
All right.

00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:12,410
A used book could be
as low as $89.
So, semester's starting.

00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:16,181
In your format, how much
is it gonna cost me?

00:35:16,181 --> 00:35:18,617
We rent digital books
for $5 a day.

00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:21,820
What's the average amount of
days that a student downloads?

00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,221
What we found was that --

00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:26,625
we're in a closed beta
with 330 students at one campus.

00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:30,195
They're using their books only
on four main occasions.

00:35:30,195 --> 00:35:32,530
We're seeing the -- the revenue
on an average student

00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:35,266
that -- that packbacks --
for our portion of the share --

00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:37,068
$34 per semester.

00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:39,037
Tell me your cost
to the publisher.

00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:43,041
So, the publishers receive
75% of revenue.
Ouch.
CORCORAN: Yeah.

00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:44,709
SHANNON:
So -- and this is --
that's the deal
you've negotiated right now?

00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:46,311
75%?
GANDHAM: This is -- so, this is
a standard industry --

00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:48,980
industry licensing agreement
for all e-books.

00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,649
So we think we --
you know,

00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:53,184
we might be able to get
up to 30% on our end.

00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:54,953
You don't -- y-you have
no exclusivity

00:35:54,953 --> 00:35:56,655
with any of these publishers,
right?

00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:59,891
'cause I've worked with these
guys for over a decade, okay?

00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:01,793
They don't give exclusivity.
That's correct.

00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:03,461
Right, so we --
we absolutely know

00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:05,230
that there's
a first-mover advantage

00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,998
to be taken advantage of
right here.

00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,000
The major players
in this space,

00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,535
they're all selling
used books.

00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:13,505
But the textbook industry
is an $8 billion industry.

00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,607
$6 billion of that
are used books.

00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:17,976
Everyone's buying a used --
but what's that got to do
with your Market?

00:36:17,976 --> 00:36:20,612
Because if -- if --
if an Amazon or a chegg

00:36:20,612 --> 00:36:22,380
were to offer
daily e-textbook rentals,

00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,549
they'd be directly cannibalizing
their used books.

00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:27,385
They're in so much trouble
because this used-book Market

00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:29,954
is -- is such a disaster
for their revenue.

00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:32,323
What percentage
of the student population

00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:33,491
are actually renting
their books

00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:34,859
versus buying them
in the first place?

00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,195
The average student
will spend about $500

00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,763
a semester
on used books.

00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:40,198
Okay, so now he's gonna rent
on a typical --
at least.

00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,534
The publisher didn't
get a dime of that
money, of those dollars.

00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,736
Okay, but he's now gonna
rent from you instead on
a daily basis?

00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:47,038
Correct.
So, what does that
come out to?

00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:51,142
In one year, he's going
to spend about $280.

00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:53,078
Oh.
So it's a great savings?
It's an amazing savings.

00:36:53,078 --> 00:36:55,714
I don't know
if it's a great saving.

00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:59,884
My son, he looks at his textbook
a lot more than four times.

00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,320
I mean, that's four days
in an entire semester?

00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,589
What we found in our research,
it doesn't --

00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:06,658
are you telling me my kids are
only looking at their textbooks,

00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:07,892
on average,
four times a semester?

00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,527
Robert, it's not because
they're not studying.

00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:11,429
It's because the professors
have a wealth of resources

00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:12,897
to put out
the necessary information.

00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,899
The book is
one more resource.

00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,202
It's not the --
the end-all, be-all.

00:37:17,202 --> 00:37:19,838
Kasey and Mike,
this is -- this --
so, Mike,
your entire pitch is,

00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:21,339
to the publisher,

00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:24,876
"I'm giving you revenue
that you're not getting"?
correct.

00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:27,812
Wow. So, guys, this is
the beauty about "Shark Tank."

00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:30,515
all the sharks have so much
knowledge in different spaces.

00:37:30,515 --> 00:37:33,384
I got to this place
in my life

00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:34,753
by having drive
and common sense.

00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,354
But, tell you the truth,
I didn't go to college,

00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:39,290
and I'm dyslexic,
so I can barely read.

00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,093
I like to invest
in businesses

00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,863
that I have some expertise in
so I can help them grow.

00:37:44,863 --> 00:37:48,166
I don't have any knowledge
in this business, so I'm out.

00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:49,567
We appreciate it --
appreciate it, Daymond.

00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:50,935
Okay, thank you very much
for your time.

00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,070
You know what I think?

00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,505
I think you're having
a much harder time

00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:55,240
selling this thing
than you're telling us.

00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,975
I admire your persistence,

00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:59,978
but I think you're gonna have
a heck of a hard time,

00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:01,179
and I can't imagine

00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:03,181
all the publishers
going along for the ride.

00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:05,049
Perhaps I'm being negative,
but I'm out.

00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:08,019
So, that kind of plays
into --
I'm out.

00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,621
You're out? Thank you
very much for your time.

00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:10,889
Thanks, Barbara.
We appreciate it.

00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:13,024
Guys, I like
what you're doing, okay?

00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:15,426
I-i know your --
your industry inside out.

00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:17,095
I have personally
negotiated deals

00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:19,230
with all of those publishers
for over a decade.

00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,166
I will give you one small piece
of advice.

00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:24,335
It'll take you a lot longer
than you think to get the deals.

00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:25,870
Oh, we know.
Okay.

00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,806
We spent two years as students
going through this ourselves.

00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:29,574
And -- and -- it -- well,
it sends a tingle up my spine

00:38:29,574 --> 00:38:31,709
to get back
into the education Market,

00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:33,611
which is where I made
the bulk of my net worth.

00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:35,346
Sure.
I can't go back there.

00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:37,248
If I walk
into those offices again,

00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:39,083
I'd rip the rest
of my hair out.

00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:40,752
Redbox and Netflix,
they -- they weren't --

00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:42,554
and iTunes -- they weren't
overnight successes.

00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:43,988
It's important
that you're young,

00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,658
'cause by the time you finish
with the educational publishers,

00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,459
you will be very old, okay?

00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:51,729
Right. But --
and -- and I'm not saying it's
not a noble pursuit.

00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:54,232
I have spent thousands of hours
in their offices.

00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:55,567
You will have no hair.

00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:57,502
You will both look like me
when this is over.

00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:58,903
CORCORAN: [ laughs ]
I am out.

00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:00,705
Thanks, Kevin.
Thank you very much.

00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:02,307
Guys --
um, here's what
we think it takes.

00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:05,076
It takes
the right context.

00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:06,444
When we find
the right individuals

00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:07,946
within the organization,
things click.

00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:09,247
HERJAVEC: Mike, look.

00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:10,448
I guess it comes down to --

00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:12,283
you know, everything's
a gut feel, right?

00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:14,919
Everything -- everything you
invest in in life is a gut feel.

00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:17,322
I just don't share
your vision for this product.

00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:18,957
I'm out.

00:39:18,957 --> 00:39:20,191
Okay.
Thanks, Robert.

00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,693
Thank you -- thank you
very much for the time.

00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:23,494
Who's left? Mark?
Mm-hmm.

00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,966
Okay.
I like the concept.

00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:29,968
I mean, I'm already
in tech Ed --

00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:32,437
degreed, ranku,
copley systems, hourlynerd.

00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:34,239
I mean, I'm -- I'm in a bunch,
so I get the space, right?

00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:37,275
But 10% isn't enough.

00:39:37,275 --> 00:39:39,410
And I want you guys
to come back to me

00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:42,580
and tell me what's
the most equity I can get,

00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,015
how, and how much.

00:39:44,015 --> 00:39:46,317
Right. Um...

00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:02,066
NARRATOR:
Four sharks are out.

00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,802
Mark is interested,
but he's not happy

00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:06,704
with the amount of equity
being offered.

00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:09,741
CUBAN: Okay.
I like the concept.

00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,643
But 10% isn't enough.

00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:13,811
And I want you guys
to come back to me

00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:16,281
and tell me what's
the most equity I can get,

00:40:16,281 --> 00:40:17,982
how, and how much.

00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:20,251
Right. Um...

00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:25,924
You can talk.
Talk?

00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:28,059
Let's go talk about it.

00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:29,861
What if we just ask him
for more?

00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:31,629
Ask him for more money

00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:33,965
and offer, uh...

00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:38,169
15% for $300,000?

00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:39,370
That's the same valuation.

00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,939
Yeah. It'd be the same.

00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:43,508
Look, if you look at it
as pay-per-view for text,

00:40:43,508 --> 00:40:45,843
then the fact that it --
that it's textbooks now...

00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:48,146
CORCORAN: Mm-hmm.
...That's just a start.

00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:50,615
In near-term, negotiating those,
uh, publisher agreements

00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:52,483
is gonna take
a long time.

00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:53,851
Yeah, I think they
can get past that

00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:55,653
because they don't have to be
completely dependent,

00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:57,588
just pay-per-view.
yeah.

00:41:02,894 --> 00:41:06,164
Mark, we agree
with what you're saying.

00:41:06,164 --> 00:41:09,133
We really value you
as an investor.

00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:12,136
We want you to be very much
vested into packback's growth.

00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:17,575
We would like to offer you
17.5% for $200,000.

00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:28,186
What about $250,000
for 20%?

00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:31,189
Would you do --
would you be ab--

00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:34,292
willing to do
$200,000 for the 20%?

00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,761
What?!

00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:37,862
Yes.

00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:39,230
No. No. That's not --
[ laughter ]

00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,698
no, you're --

00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:42,600
no, that's not --
no, we're thinking.
we're thinking.

00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,335
We're thinking. No, no.
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,537
I-i-i meant -- yeah.
No, no, he --
he did it wrong.

00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:48,272
Are you sure you want to be
in a deal with these guys?

00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:50,708
Let's hit
the rewind button on that.

00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:53,077
Yeah, so, we --
we would AC--
we'll accept your deal.

00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:55,346
We would like to accept
your deal, Mark.
250-- I'll cut you guys
a break.

00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,415
$250,000 for 20% equity.
For 20%. There you go. Yes.

00:41:57,415 --> 00:41:59,617
[ laughter ]
Thanks, Mark.
Appreciate it.

00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:00,985
All right, that was --

00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:03,154
all right.
congrats, guys. it'll be fun.
all right.

00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:05,490
You guys wouldn't have
been best friends anymore
after that one.

00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:07,058
[ laughter ]

00:42:07,058 --> 00:42:08,593
It's all right.
Thank you, guys.
JOHN: Congratulations.

00:42:08,593 --> 00:42:09,627
Thank you, guys.
Thank you very much.

00:42:11,596 --> 00:42:13,865
What I actually meant
to say was

00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:16,801
we were hoping to get
$250,000 at the 17.5%.

00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:18,403
I may, uh...
[ laughs ]

00:42:18,403 --> 00:42:20,838
I'm, uh -- I'm a sharp kid.
I can do math.

00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:22,840
But, uh, when you're
in the tank,

00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,876
it's -- it's not
that easy, right?

00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:27,612
Yeah, that was
a code red.
