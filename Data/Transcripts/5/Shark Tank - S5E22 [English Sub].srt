00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:04,771
NARRATOR:
This is the Shark Tank,
where hopeful entrepreneurs

00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:06,974
get a once-in-a-lifetime chance
to pitch the sharks

00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:09,109
in hopes
of getting an investment

00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:11,778
to start, grow,
or save their businesses.

00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:14,181
Who's ready to unleash
your inner bear?

00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,749
The entrepreneurs
must convince a shark

00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:18,352
to invest the full amount
they're asking for...

00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:21,054
We will take you from zero
to kitchen hero.

00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:23,290
...Or they'll walk away
with nothing.

00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,025
What does it cost?
$39.99.

00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,060
Guys, I love the product.
I hate the price.

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,229
You sharks might be thinking
you've seen this before.

00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:30,631
You sharks haven't.

00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:32,065
Talk is cheap.
Money talks.

00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:33,300
Here's where I think
you're going with that.

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,068
You know where I'm going
with it.

00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:37,804
NARRATOR: If the sharks
hear a great idea...

00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:39,106
This year, we're looking
to do $5 million.

00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:41,208
Tell me the projection
for the next six months.

00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,243
We'll do about $10 million
in sales.
Ooh.
Wow.

00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:45,979
None of you sound that smart.
Who said, "I have an idea"?

00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,282
He did.
I knew it, and you're
the best-looking one, too.

00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:51,552
NARRATOR: ...They're ready
to invest using their own money.

00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:54,288
I don't do good deals.
I do great deals.

00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:57,124
[ laughs ]
I'll give you $50,000
for 10%.

00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:58,625
I thought
you were out.
Shut up.

00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,561
Don't tell me to shut up.
Shut up.

00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,529
NARRATOR: And they're
willing to fight each other

00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,131
for a piece of the action.

00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:06,667
I'll give you $100,000
at 20%.

00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,969
My offer's
a better offer.
I wouldn't listen.

00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:12,205
What do
you guys think?
Guys, if you listen
to this offer,

00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:13,340
there's
an expiration date.

00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,309
I guarantee you my offer's
better than that.

00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:16,810
Appreciate the offer.
We do.

00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,947
I scooped you.
I'm really pissed,
Lori.

00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:22,282
Who are the sharks?

00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:25,752
They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors

00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,888
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.

00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:31,959
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist

00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:34,394
who turned a $10,000 loan

00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:38,999
into a software business
worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,403
Barbara Corcoran went
from waiting tables in Manhattan

00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:47,507
to building the city's
preeminent real-estate empire.

00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:50,711
Robert Herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,

00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:52,813
is now a technology mogul

00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:57,351
who sold his first internet
companies for over $350 million.

00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:02,456
Lori Greiner, the queen of QVC,
holds over 100 patents

00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,191
and has launched
over 300 products,

00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:08,495
grossing over a half a billion
dollars in retail sales.

00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:10,130
And Mark Cuban --

00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,367
notorious billionaire
entrepreneur, tech guru,

00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:25,646
and the outspoken owner
of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.

00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:26,813
First into the tank

00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,182
are entrepreneurs
from Park City, Utah,

00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:32,285
with a healthier version
of a favorite breakfast treat.

00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:39,292
Hey, sharks.
I'm Joel Clark.

00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:40,627
And I'm
Cameron Smith.

00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,963
Our product
is Kodiak Cakes.

00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:45,699
We're here seeking
$500,000

00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:48,435
in exchange for 10%
of our business.

00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:51,071
Kodiak Cakes is
a flapjack-and-waffle mix.

00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:55,275
It's unique because it's made
with 100% whole grains,

00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,277
has no added fats
or sugars,

00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:59,846
and all you have to do
to make it is add water.

00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,082
But most importantly,
it tastes amazing.

00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:03,283
It really does.

00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,484
And when I was
8 years old,

00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:06,153
I went around
the neighborhood

00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:09,189
and sold pancake mixes
like these out of a red wagon.
[ laughter ]

00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,691
my mom had always wanted

00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,859
to sell her whole-wheat
pancake recipe as a mix,

00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,394
so we decided
to give it a try.

00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,296
We're determined
to build Kodiak Cakes

00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,331
into a nationally
recognized brand.

00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,067
We believe
we have great products,

00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:21,601
and we have
a proven track record.

00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:23,937
Now, who's ready
to unleash your inner bear

00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:25,839
and start flipping
flapjacks with us?
[ roars ]
aah!

00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:28,875
So, we're gonna give you guys
a sample to try.
All right.

00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,812
We've got
our berry syrup here.
Thank you.
You're so polite.

00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:33,980
What kind of berries?
Mountain berries,
so it has a mix of berries.

00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,916
There's about five different
berries in there.
Thank you.

00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,351
Uh-huh.
Is this your product, too,
the berry syrup?

00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:41,054
It is. Yeah. We have a line
of fruit syrups, as well.

00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,222
Wow, they're very good.

00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,591
Oh, thank you.
The berry syrup's
amazing.

00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,593
The berry syrup's
really good.

00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,361
That's good, isn't it?
I'm glad you like that.

00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:49,763
I don't know. I love it.
I'd eat more.

00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:52,899
Every day, we get letters
in to our website saying,

00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,736
"hey, that is the best
pancake mix I have ever tried."

00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,637
what's your track record
that's so proven?

00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:00,240
Yeah, so,
we've actually been able

00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,642
to get this product
into target stores nationwide.

00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,111
Target?
Come on.

00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:07,080
The first order to target
was about a $260,000 order.

00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,683
That's a sizable order.
Good for you.
It was a huge order.

00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:11,184
In a year,
how much more have you sold

00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,053
since the first
$260,000?

00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:16,790
So, this year, we'll do
around $1 million at target.
Wow.

00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,392
We have an everyday
low price with target,

00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:23,897
but we still have
a 45% margin on that price.

00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:26,466
They rolled it out into over
1,600 target stores nationwide.

00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,834
Are they reordering?
They are.

00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:30,203
That's why we came here,
'cause we need the money now

00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,372
to grow more so we can launch
some innovative products.

00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:34,741
But why not just borrow money
against your receivables?

00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:37,611
Right.
Why not roll over the money
that you're bringing in

00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,347
and not even have to take out
any type of loan?

00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:43,450
Yeah, we could grow
the pancake mix like we are,

00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,352
but we're ready to explode
this business now.

00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:46,686
How much you gonna sell?

00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,655
So, this year, we're looking
to do $5 million.

00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,390
And last year,
we did $2.5 million,

00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,424
so we're looking
to double.

00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:53,093
CORCORAN: And all
in pancake mix?

00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:54,694
CLARK:
It's about 75% pancake mix,

00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,630
and then the syrups
are about 22%,

00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,999
and then we have
a couple of other products.

00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,267
Joel, let's be realistic.
Yeah.

00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:01,701
This is a complete commodity.

00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,638
There's nothing
proprietary about it.

00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,406
What you have here
is a brand you're building.

00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:09,276
Ultimately,
if the brand becomes big enough,

00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:10,577
we hope that
a major takes it out

00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:11,745
because
it's starting to itch

00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:13,146
and steal some
of their shelf space.

00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,147
Sure.
Yeah.

00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,515
You're not there yet,

00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:18,518
because $5 million in
this category is not that much.

00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,954
Right.
But it's
an interesting beginning.

00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:22,989
So let's just focus on what
you've asked for this company.

00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,826
You're telling me
you want $500,000 for 10%.

00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,195
That imputes
a value of $5 million.
Yeah.

00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:29,262
You know
you're not worth that.

00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,331
Well, we think
we are.

00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:35,101
You're trying to sell it to me
at 10 times your pretax profits.

00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,270
Never.

00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:41,141
What we've found is that
people are willing to pay

00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,876
for that whole-grain,
healthy breakfast product.

00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,044
A lot of those other

00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:47,047
white-flour, white-mix
pancake mixes out there,

00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:48,849
those are commodities.

00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,952
But those guys, without
mentioning their brand --

00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:53,553
no.
famous aunt involved,
here.

00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:54,621
[ laughter ]

00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:56,556
She leads the share
in this market.

00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:59,025
So you're taking share
away from her,
yeah.

00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,327
And I would think

00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:02,996
that she's significantly lower
in price right now.

00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:04,331
She is.
How much lower?

00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:05,398
Up to 50%.

00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:09,836
You think that
the average mom out there

00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,671
is gonna walk
into a store

00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:14,941
and pay twice as much
for a premium product.

00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:16,276
They are, though.

00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:18,378
Our sales are really,
really increasing.

00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,348
In the last three years,
we've grown at 40% to 50%,

00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:22,349
year on year.

00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,718
Our cost is $1.65,

00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,954
and our selling price
is an average of $3.02.

00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:29,723
I think your packaging,
though, I just have to say,

00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:30,724
I think
it's interesting.

00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,425
It makes you think,

00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:36,730
"oh, that seems like outdoor,
camping, you know, griddle."
yeah.

00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,964
People love
this brand.

00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,099
They don't know the brand.

00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,268
A mom doesn't walk
into target and say,

00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:43,370
"Oh, it's
the Kodiak Cakes guys."

00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:46,406
The thousand-pound bear
in the room --

00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,842
not this one.
this is a ratty little thing.

00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,010
[ laughter ]

00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,544
The big problem is,

00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,880
you've got two monster
competitors in this space.

00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,282
Yeah.

00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:57,918
You have to put in the risk
when you value the business,

00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,786
because if they want
your shelf space at target,

00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,254
they can come
and take it from you.

00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,856
No, because target --
yes, they can.

00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:05,759
Here's why
you're wrong, Kevin.
No, I'm not wrong.
Not on a commodity.

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,361
I'm never wrong, Mark,
by the way.

00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,829
Because target, Costco,

00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,565
they have to have competition
for the big brands.

00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:15,035
They have to have
some leverage.
It doesn't mean they have
to let them be profitable.

00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:18,004
They can make these guys stay
in there with listing fees
till the cows come home.

00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:20,006
So, they put them out
of business, and then
who takes their place?

00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:22,575
There always has to be a
second product. There always
has to be a third product,

00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:26,313
because otherwise, they're not
gonna keep the big guys honest.
no. they leave them on life
support with crappy margins.

00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:29,916
We can sell half as much
as the famous aunt in a store --

00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,485
half -- and still generate
a higher margin,

00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:35,388
more revenue
for the store.

00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,557
HERJAVEC: Joel, you're making
half a million dollars a year.

00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:38,825
That's fantastic.

00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:43,763
I haven't heard any reason
why you need $500,000.

00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,165
So, what
we want to do is

00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:48,401
we want to spend a huge chunk
of that on slotting fees.

00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:51,538
That's like buying your way
into the store...
Oh!

00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:53,440
Oh.
Which we generate a return
on in 10 to 20 weeks.

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,975
Explain to everybody
what a slotting fee is.

00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,443
You're buying
shelf space.

00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:59,012
Yeah. You're paying an up-front
fee to get your shelf space.

00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:02,716
Have you done that
before?
We have done that for 17 years,
and we get a return on it.

00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:06,052
I have to defend you,
because there's a million people

00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,787
that would want to pay
the same slotting fee,

00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,689
so they picked you.
and you made it work.

00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,424
He did it. He got
to target without it.

00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,026
Let's say I give you
$500,000, all right?

00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,694
How do I get my money back,
and when?

00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:17,497
We're gonna build this thing
to $20 million in four years.

00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,732
How much can you sell

00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:20,767
a $20 million commodity
pancake business for?

00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,469
Well, this is not a
commodity pancake business.

00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:23,803
This is a branded
pancake business.

00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,038
Let's not argue
about that.

00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:27,007
Tell me how much
you're planning to sell it for.

00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,408
Well, at that point,

00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:30,443
we're gonna go for one to
one and a half times revenue.

00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:31,845
I believe we'll get
one and a half times,

00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,413
so we'll go
for $30 million.

00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,517
Food companies --
I'm sorry --

00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,053
just don't trade
for 10 times cash flow.

00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:42,489
They do -- 8 to 10 times.
Our research shows that.

00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:43,790
We've talked
to investment bankers.

00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,458
We're talking to people
all the time.

00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,060
I love it
when people tell you that,

00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,862
but they never write a check
for you.

00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,531
I'm the only disciplined,
rational investor up here.

00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,533
Everybody else gets
emotionally involved,

00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,068
[ laughter ]
all right? not me.

00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:57,370
All right, guys.
Let me take a shot at this.

00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,041
I don't do good deals.
I do great deals, okay?
[ laughs ]

00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,909
and I make sure
they're great deals

00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,544
so that both sides
make money.

00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,413
I'll tell you
what your company's worth today,

00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:09,349
and I'm right.
it's worth $2 million, okay?

00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:16,056
You have to give up
25% equity, minimum,

00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,724
for this 500k,

00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,794
because you have to
jump this thing by 30%

00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:24,364
to even make it something that a
major competitor will take out.

00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:26,099
You have a lot of work
ahead of you,

00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:29,369
and for that ride,
I'd want a new-risk premium --

00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:31,471
50% of the business.

00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:45,351
NARRATOR:
All five sharks are still in.

00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:46,553
Kevin is interested

00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:49,422
but believes the company
is highly overvalued.

00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,924
You have a lot of work
ahead of you.

00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,560
And for that ride,
I'd want a new-risk premium --

00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,195
50% of the business.

00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,531
I said I do great deals.

00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,533
That would be a great deal.
That would make sense.

00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,001
That'd be a great deal
for you.
[ laughter ]

00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,403
you know, when
the devil looks at you,

00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:04,871
he always says
it's a great deal, right?

00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:06,172
That's why they call me
Mr. Wonderful.

00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:08,174
But listen, I know you're
not gonna accept that offer,

00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:09,809
so I'm not gonna make it,
and I'm out.

00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,046
Here's where I'm at.

00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,280
I'd love to be involved,

00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,915
but there's got to be
a premium in it for me.

00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,584
I mean, I think
there's a lot of risk,

00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:20,887
so I'm gonna price-end
that risk for me.

00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:23,623
I'll give you the $500,000
for 35%.

00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,028
Appreciate the offer.
We do.

00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:30,897
Which means you're taking
the offer?

00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:32,465
Barbara, we want to hear
from you before we --

00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,534
I have a partial offer.

00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:38,338
I'm gonna give you
$250,000 for 20%,

00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:40,773
but you're going to have to
get the other $250,000

00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,242
from one other shark.

00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,182
GREINER:
You know what?

00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:51,551
I have to love
what I get into,

00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:54,454
and I don't really
like pancakes...

00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:55,755
So I'm out.

00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:59,225
You know, I think
it's a good business,

00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,427
but I just think you're
gonna have more challenges.

00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,530
You've been on a nice ride.
You've executed incredibly well.

00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,798
You're efficient.
You're great salespeople.

00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:08,101
But I think you're gonna run
into some macro challenges.

00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:09,035
I'm out.

00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,373
Let me ask you a question
I don't think you considered.

00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:14,874
I think it's worth
discussing now

00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,843
'cause it's getting into
my interest range again.

00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,645
I thought
you were out.
No, wait --

00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,914
why do I always have to listen
to you all day long?
shut up.

00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:23,583
Don't tell me to shut up.
Shut up.
I'm doing it right now.

00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,485
If I wanted 2% share,

00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:26,953
which is what
you're gonna get this year

00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:28,154
if you're lucky
in this market,

00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,689
could I buy it myself
for $5 million

00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,124
without even
having you involved?

00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:33,426
What, you're gonna go start
a pancake company in your house?

00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:34,727
If I wanted to,
could I do it?

00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:36,162
No, not you.
That's
so ridiculous!

00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:37,597
Absolutely,
I could do it.
No way.

00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:38,798
I could hire
a couple of guys,

00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:40,600
go get a co-packer
to make this paste up,

00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,236
and I could
buy myself
you know what?
that's ridiculous.

00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:45,805
2% share of this market
easily for $2 million.

00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:46,906
Let's
watch him do it.
That's
ridiculous.

00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,241
I could buy
the shelf space.

00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:49,709
No, you couldn't.
HERJAVEC:
You know what, guys?

00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,111
I made you a decent offer.
Nobody else made you an offer.

00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,413
GREINER:
Barbara did.
I did.
Excuse me.

00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:56,049
She didn't make an offer
for the $500,000!

00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,717
All right, I'll help her out.
I'll help her out.

00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:01,120
I want -- for $250,000,
I want 25% of this business,

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,989
'cause I think I'm right
about what it's worth.

00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:04,324
So what's the offer?

00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,793
I'll join her. She's gonna
up her equity to 25%.

00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:09,562
I feel greedy,
but I'll go along with him.

00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,864
So now you have $500,000
from two sharks.

00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,600
I want 25%
for my investment.

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,667
Means you're giving up
half the business,

00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,336
'cause it's only worth
$2 million, guys.

00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:19,772
I'm sorry.
HERJAVEC: So, guys, you got an
offer from Kevin and Barbara,

00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:24,143
$500,000 for 50%, or an offer
of $500,000 for 35%.

00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,448
What are you going to do?

00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:34,654
Well, you guys,
thank you.

00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:36,089
I mean, we do appreciate
the offers.

00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,323
We appreciate
the interest.

00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,826
But we feel the value's
way beyond what you've said.

00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:41,427
We really do.

00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,229
So we need to decline
the offers.

00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,231
Seriously?
You're turning down $500,000?

00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,566
Yeah, we're gonna
turn it down,

00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:48,635
but we really, really
appreciate it. we really do.

00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:50,036
I think
you guys are smart.

00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:51,037
GREINER:
I do, too.

00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:52,138
Good luck,
guys.
Good luck.

00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,473
Appreciate it.
Thanks.

00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:55,074
HERJAVEC:
Thank you.
O'LEARY:
All right, Robert,

00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,676
get me the tranquilizer gun.
I'm taking the bear out.

00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:58,278
[ laughter ]
GREINER: Run, bear.

00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,213
Run, bear, run!

00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:04,117
Even you couldn't put
a $5 million valuation on that.

00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,752
There's no way that thing
was worth $5 million.

00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,086
Yes, it was, easily.

00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,956
They're buying every
square inch of shelf space.

00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,291
All that has to happen is

00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,192
the auntie has to go on deal
for a couple of months,

00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,261
and they'll squeeze these guys
like teenage pimples.

00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,430
You don't think that
the other bigger brands

00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,233
have done discounts right next
to them in target and Costco?

00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:21,234
Of course they have.

00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:24,771
Total commodity, 100%.
With a bear.

00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:26,639
Next.
Who cares?

00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,012
NARRATOR:
Earlier this season,

00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:35,415
we saw Melissa and Rick hinnant
make a deal with Barbara

00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:38,318
for their fashion-sock company,
grace and lace.

00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,986
You picked the smartest
person here. Good for you.

00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,688
Let's see
how they're doing now.

00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:46,459
Only five days after airing,
sales hit $1 million.

00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:47,794
We couldn't
believe it.

00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:50,530
And since we aired,
just three short months ago,

00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,398
we've almost done
$3 million in sales.

00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:55,001
MELISSA:
Before "Shark Tank," we had six
moms working out of our garage.

00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,837
Since the show, we've moved into
a 3,000-square-foot facility

00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:01,341
and now have over 36 people
working for grace and lace.

00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,109
Hi, guys.
Hey, Barbara.
How are you?

00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:06,012
Did you get the samples
out to Berkshire?
Yep.

00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,914
Barbara has already
arranged a meeting

00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:10,817
with the world's largest
manufacturer of knitted goods,

00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:12,985
and through her contacts,
our products are gonna be

00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:15,355
in the hands of people
at "vogue" and "bazaar"

00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,190
and these amazing magazines
in New York City.

00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,392
Bye-bye.
Back to work.

00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:22,729
MELISSA: Walking into a store
and seeing grace and lace

00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,130
almost brings me to tears.

00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,566
I cannot believe
that this is my brand

00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:28,234
sitting there being sold
on their tables.

00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:29,602
Our dreams are coming true,

00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,938
and really, it's all
because of "Shark Tank."

00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,140
[ giggles ]
whoa!
whee!

00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,341
When I look
at my kids now,

00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,777
I see that we're creating
a legacy for them.

00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:41,114
To know that your family's
future is more secure,

00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:44,450
if not completely secure,
is such a good feeling.

00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,852
Absolutely
a life changer.

00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:47,220
Mwah.
Mwah.

00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,496
NARRATOR:
Next into the tank are two moms

00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:59,832
with a must-have accessory
for parents on the go.

00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,443
Hi, sharks.
I'm Christie Barany.

00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:11,978
I'm
Courtney Turich.

00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:14,247
TOGETHER:
And we're the Monkey Mat Mamas.

00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:19,085
We're seeking $100,000 in
exchange for 30% of our company.

00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,454
Our product is the
award-winning Monkey Mat.

00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:25,858
The Monkey Mat is the only
clean, portable surface

00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,460
you can have
anywhere you go.

00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,062
It's an innovative, new
essential for life on the go.

00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:31,697
No bulky blankets
required.

00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:34,400
So, the original inspiration
for the Monkey Mat

00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,171
came during an unexpected
six-hour layover at the airport,

00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:40,173
where I watched
my two beautiful girls

00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:44,877
crawl and eat and play all over
those dirty, disgusting floors.

00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:45,978
Ew.
Total cringe.

00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:47,680
There has to be
a better way.

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,049
We searched for a solution
to meet our needs,

00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,952
and when nothing existed,
we decided to create it.

00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:56,722
There is nothing that provides
the portability, versatility,

00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:59,792
and functionality with style
like the Monkey Mat.

00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,495
The attached pouch
with easy buckle straps

00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:03,696
secures onto anything --

00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:07,467
cooler, stroller, bike handle,
purse, or diaper bag.

00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:12,004
The custom fabric is soft,
durable, and water-repellant,

00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:15,074
and grass, dirt, sand,
and messes shake right off.

00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,976
The corners have weights

00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,245
as well as loops
for additional grounding,

00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:20,913
and in the center
of the mat,

00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:24,083
there are loops for key
or toy attachments.

00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,952
And, of course, it's
all machine-washable.

00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:27,954
It comes in
four vibrant colors.

00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:30,690
It is perfect
for outdoor concerts,

00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,459
sporting events, picnics,
at the beach.

00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:35,294
The response
has been fantastic,

00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:39,298
but we need your help elevating
our business to the next level.

00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:40,533
Can we see them?

00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:42,034
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:44,737
Courtney, I love the way
it folds back up.
Absolutely.

00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,939
People are very amazed when
they see how quick and easy

00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,541
it goes back
into the pouch.

00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,611
GREINER: So, I have
to ask, are you related?

00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:54,714
We get asked that a lot,
and we are not related.

00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:56,916
However,
we're dear friends.

00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,252
We've known each other
for 11 years.

00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:01,454
Christie, well, do you
have sales today?

00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:04,690
We do. We have $60,000 of sales
in our first year of business.

00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,792
And how are you getting
those sales?

00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:09,662
We are available
on our own website.

00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:11,464
We have 51 retailers --

00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:14,267
storefront retailers
and online businesses.

00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:17,036
And we're also available in
three countries outside the U.S.

00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,170
And what
does it cost?

00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,839
$39.99.

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,108
Ooh! Wow.
Retail?

00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:23,142
Retail.
Ouch. Ouch.

00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,610
What is the cost to you?

00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,513
What does it cost you to make
it, and where do you make it?

00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,115
We actually make it
in China,

00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:32,251
so with shipping and customs,
we're at $13.14.

00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:33,219
Wow.

00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,287
That sounds high.

00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:35,588
That sounds really high.
Why?

00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:38,491
What's in the material
that makes it cost so much?

00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:41,227
It's a ripstop nylon,
but it's treated specially

00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,596
to be both water-repellant
and also soft.

00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:46,465
There's another material
that's embedded.

00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:49,535
The weights are
stainless-steel disks.

00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,971
The stainless-steel disks
are about 50 cents apiece,

00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:53,873
so times four.
oh!
GREINER:
Which is a lot.

00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:54,974
It is a lot.
It's very high.

00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:56,242
And how many disks
are there?

00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,044
Four, so there's one
in each corner.

00:17:58,044 --> 00:17:59,579
I want you to help me
with something,

00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,881
'cause I'm just
struggling a little bit, okay?

00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:03,649
It's a piece of nylon
on the floor.

00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:09,088
Why's anybody gonna pay
20, 30 bucks for this

00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:13,659
when it's 2 bucks off a roll
in any clothing store?

00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,528
You know what? At the end
of the day, Mr. Wonderful.

00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:19,265
Yes.
If you can carry a yoga mat,
which people use it as,

00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:22,668
a beach blanket,
a picnic blanket,

00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,437
a baby blanket onto --

00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,405
you can't stuff those
in your glove compartment,

00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:27,873
you can't throw them in the
trunk of your car all together,

00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,342
you can't --

00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:31,744
it's a convenience item
more than a --
it is. definitely.

00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:33,079
If you're
gonna plan --
absolutely.

00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,547
Are you gonna pay
30 bucks for it?

00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:36,716
I'm telling you, my wife,
in a heartbeat, would do it,

00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:39,485
because it's for those
times you don't expect
something to happen.

00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:42,455
Exactly.
Whether it's the airport,
or whether you're around...

00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,256
Guys, I love the product.
I hate the price.

00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:48,260
I think the price
has to be $9.99.
And he's right.

00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,998
The higher-end-mom environment
are gonna buy it, right?

00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:53,899
But that doesn't make it
a mass product.

00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:57,103
Can you make it a mass product
with a $9.95 retail

00:18:57,103 --> 00:19:00,306
that resembles anything that
has any of the quality at all?

00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:03,776
I don't believe,
for that cost,

00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:05,544
we would be able to provide

00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:08,948
the quality of product
that we're looking to provide

00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:11,617
with the versatility,
with the functionality.

00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:14,353
Quality? It's a piece of cloth
on the floor in the airport!

00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:16,555
Christie, I think it's
a very clever product,

00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,858
but what I heard you say
today is,

00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:22,461
from what you know today,
you can't get the price point

00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:24,430
to have it become
a mass-market product.

00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,367
I'm out.

00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,036
Thank you very much.

00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:32,638
You guys, with the right
strategic partner, you could.

00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:33,839
Right.
Yes.
I mean, I know

00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,808
because I manufacture
things made out of fabric.

00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:38,177
I have for 17 years.
You think you can bring
this down?

00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,111
Yes, I do.

00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,413
I don't get it.

00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:41,380
I just don't get it.

00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,815
You know what,
Mr. Wonderful?

00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,984
We have parents who use
this as a time-out mat.

00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:47,019
We might have to put you
over in the corner.

00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,755
I'd rather put it over top
of him, not underneath him.

00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:52,024
That's a good idea,
too.
They use it as
fort covers, too.

00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,392
Listen, somebody
figured out

00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,194
how to make an umbrella
so inexpensive,

00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,596
when it rains, I buy one
and I throw it out afterwards.

00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,298
That's where
you need to go.

00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:02,168
And maybe you'll get there,
but it won't be with me.

00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:03,235
I'm out.

00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:06,038
All right.
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,041
It's too small.
It should be larger.

00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,577
The colors are off.
They're not hip.

00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,746
And last, what you've heard
again and again,

00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:15,181
it's way too expensive.

00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:16,716
I think it's
a $10 product.

00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:20,186
It should be priced exactly like
those cheap portable umbrellas

00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:22,955
that come in a little kit.
that's it.

00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,890
It's not for me.
I'm out.

00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,828
Thanks
for your feedback.

00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:31,797
I want you to do one thing
right now.
Sure.

00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:35,668
Take it and fold it up
and put it back into the
zippered pouch for me.

00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:38,571
Fold it or stuff it?
Well, I want to see
how hard it is.

00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,406
I want to see how fast
you can do it.
Well, you
should do it.

00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:41,941
They've been doing it
the whole time.

00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:43,109
Look. Here's
the real test.

00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:45,578
Yeah, Mark,
you do it.
[ laughter ]

00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:48,347
it's a contest.
who's faster?
I cram.

00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:50,316
TURICH: Yeah, exactly. Christie
has a rolling technique.

00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:53,419
Mark's doing it the dad way --
just shove it in.
Yeah. No.

00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,054
But it works
the same.
I feel like
a magician, right?

00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:56,922
Oh, here I go!
I'm gonna --

00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,390
wow.
he wins.

00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,025
Whoo!
You beat me!

00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:03,129
Hey, now. See?
See how easy it is?
Awesome.

00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:04,930
Yeah, no,
it's actually --
well, if Mark
can do it...

00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,233
You know, I want to see if,
Mark, you'll go in with me.

00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:08,634
Okay.

00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:11,737
We'll give you an offer
for the $100,000...

00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,074
...35%.

00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,445
I think between Mark and I
and our connections,

00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:20,513
we can get this in.

00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:21,680
I can help you
with the manufacturing

00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,681
to get this way down.

00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,083
And I could help you
with the online.

00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,551
And he'll help you
with the online.

00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:27,486
And I'll help you with
all the different retailers.

00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,188
What do you guys think?

00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:30,723
100k for 35%.

00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:32,191
Got to tell us
right now.

00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:33,626
Yep.
You're one handshake away.

00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:37,830
Let's do this.
Let's do the deal.

00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,931
There you go.
Done.

00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:40,933
We're not
monkeying around.

00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:42,234
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.

00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,270
We're so excited.

00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,638
Oh, well,
you're great.
Thank you, Lori.

00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:46,572
It's gonna
be fabulous.

00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:47,706
You covered everything.
I love that.

00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:48,941
It's clever.

00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:50,609
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:53,946
Whoo!
We did it!
[ laughs ]

00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:55,948
way to go!

00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:59,652
If you make your money back
on this within even five years,
six months.
Six months.

00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:02,454
I will eat one of those mats.
I'll eat a mat.
GREINER: Yes, Mark.

00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:05,925
That is not a magic carpet.
That is a ride to hell.

00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:19,505
NARRATOR: Next up is a unique
alternative to delivered meals.

00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,785
Hi, sharks.
I'm Nick Taranto.

00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:34,420
And I'm Josh Hix.

00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,955
And we're the founders
of Plated.

00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:39,024
We're here today to ask you
for $500,000

00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:44,063
in exchange for 4% equity in
our rapidly growing company.
[ laughter ]

00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:48,300
at Plated, our mission is
to help Americans eat better.

00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,836
Josh and I met
at Harvard business school.

00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:54,240
After school, we both had
the same problem --

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,208
getting good food
on the table

00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,678
was difficult, time-consuming,
and expensive.

00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:01,180
We knew there had to be
a better way.

00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,581
So we started Plated.

00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:04,817
Plated delivers
all of the ingredients

00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:06,619
in the exact portions
you need

00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:09,822
to make a chef-designed,
delicious, nutritious meal

00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:12,157
at home
in 30 minutes or less.

00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:13,826
You come to the site,

00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:17,429
pick out only exactly
what you want and how much,

00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,765
and then we deliver
all of the ingredients,

00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:22,434
along with recipe cards
and instructional videos

00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:25,237
teaching you how to make
a delicious dish at home.

00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,806
Since we launched
six months ago,

00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:31,543
we've served tens of thousands
of meals around the Northeast.

00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:34,813
Now we need you guys
to take us nationwide.

00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:36,382
Sharks,
who's hungry?

00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:39,551
GREINER: So, I want to see
if I understand this right.

00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:41,320
I mean, I order
from a service.

00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,790
They deliver right to my door
my groceries,

00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,660
and all I have to do, then,
is just portion it out.

00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,962
But then you still have to go
find the recipe.

00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:52,164
You have to figure out
what you want to eat.

00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:54,967
CUBAN: [ scoffs ]
If I'm using a recipe card --

00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:56,535
recipe card, cookbook.

00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,103
Six of one,
half dozen of the other.

00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:01,373
We will take you from zero
to kitchen hero in 30 minutes.

00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:04,610
Our customers tell us
that they love the experience

00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,512
of getting everything
pre-portioned.

00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:08,013
It's easy to make.

00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:10,015
And the meal --
did you say it comes frozen?
All fresh.

00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:11,617
GREINER:
And what does it cost?

00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,385
Starts at
$10 per person.

00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:15,621
You need to order
four portions.

00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,823
So it's a
$40 minimum order.
Who pays shipping?

00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,758
We do.
That's included
in the price.

00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:22,161
GREINER: Is that sent overnight
with an ice pack in it?

00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:24,363
You got it.
Same day
or overnight.

00:24:24,363 --> 00:24:26,398
We have customers who
literally write in to us cold

00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:27,900
and tell us that
twice a week,

00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,869
they put the kids to bed, and
this is time with their spouse,

00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:33,205
and it's a ritual, and it's
helping their relationship.

00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:35,174
O'LEARY: But you don't need
to use your service to do that.

00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:36,942
I'm very interested in
understanding the premium delta.

00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:38,444
You don't,
but they are using it.

00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:41,947
If I'm a family buying Lori's
way, or buying at the grocer's,

00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,248
over the course of a year,

00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:45,384
how much more is the family
paying to eat?

00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:47,553
Yeah. So, here's where I think
you're going with that.

00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:49,154
You know where I'm going
with it.

00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,423
I have a lot of customers
that are grocery chains.

00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:52,958
The margins are awful.

00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:55,094
TARANTO: Here's the
dirty secret of grocery.

00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:56,195
When you start out,

00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:57,730
the gross margins are
actually pretty good --

00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,598
somewhere between
40% and 50%.

00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:01,967
But then you have spoilage
and overhead,

00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:04,837
and that chews up
95% of the margin.

00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:07,206
A grocery store throws away,
in some cases,

00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:09,174
half of
the perishable food.

00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,243
Plated delivers the amount
of spice you need

00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:12,378
and not the $20 jar.

00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:14,380
You get the amount
of basil you need

00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,281
and not a giant thing
that will wilt.

00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:19,084
Right, so you can make the
argument you're saving money
'cause you're not wasting.

00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:21,387
We're throwing away less than
1% of what we order every week.

00:25:21,387 --> 00:25:23,155
O'LEARY: Let's talk
about money for a second.

00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:24,423
HERJAVEC: Well, Kevin,
can I just ask them?

00:25:24,423 --> 00:25:25,524
They've been doing this
for how long?

00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:26,925
Seven months.

00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:28,961
Tell us about the actual numbers
you've had in seven months.

00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:30,963
Our margins today
are 40%.

00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:31,930
Right.

00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,499
Those will go to 60%
at scale.

00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:35,801
$350,000 in total sales,

00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:38,170
but $100,000 of that
was the last month.

00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,506
Tell me the projection
for the next six months.

00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:42,875
Calendar year,
$2 1/2 million in sales.

00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:46,345
Hmm.
And in the next 12 months, we'll
do about 10 million in sales.

00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:47,613
Okay.

00:25:47,613 --> 00:25:49,748
We project $1 million
a month in revenue

00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:51,050
by the end of the year.

00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,786
So, you're ramping up
every month?

00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:56,021
We're growing at over 40%
each month.

00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:58,657
Josh, how much cash did you have
to spend to start the business?

00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:00,692
We each put in north
of $50,000 to start.

00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:02,795
CUBAN: And then you
raised how much money?

00:26:02,795 --> 00:26:04,396
To date,
about $3 million.

00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,464
At what valuation?

00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:07,966
Post-money --
$9 1/2 million.
Okay.

00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:09,802
HERJAVEC:
Talk to me about expansion.

00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:12,871
We'll have a half a dozen or so
hubs around the country.

00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:14,206
We have two active now.

00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:16,708
From our warehouse
in Brooklyn

00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:18,644
and our warehouse
outside of Chicago,

00:26:18,644 --> 00:26:21,213
we cover the entire Northeast
and the entire Midwest.

00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:23,682
We're starting in San Francisco
in about four weeks.

00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:26,018
You're shipping California
from Chicago?
Tell me about
your background.

00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:27,953
I was doing tech
startups before.

00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:31,857
Worked in finance for a bit,
and met Nick at business school.

00:26:31,857 --> 00:26:33,926
Mm-hmm.
Josh is super-modest.

00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:36,195
He's a great engineer
coming out of Georgia Tech.

00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:38,330
Spent five years building
a software business.

00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,466
I went to Dartmouth college
undergrad.

00:26:40,466 --> 00:26:41,633
I did the joint degree

00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:43,469
at the Kennedy school
and Harvard business school,

00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:45,304
went to the Marine Corps
after hbs.

00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:46,438
Wow.
Very impressive.

00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,307
So I became the only person
to ever do that.

00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:49,675
And how long were you
in the marines for?

00:26:49,675 --> 00:26:51,710
You got to do more
with your lives. You
haven't done enough.

00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,911
So, I did a year
of active duty.

00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:54,079
I became
an infantry officer,

00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,981
and now I'm still
in the reserves.
wow.

00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:58,617
That's great.
O'LEARY:
Have you considered, once
you've captured that customer,

00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,153
perhaps there comes a week
when they're so busy

00:27:01,153 --> 00:27:02,554
that they need
the food prepared.

00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:04,223
Totally. Know where
you're going with that,

00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:05,524
and the different
product lines

00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:06,959
are six months from now
coming out.

00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,727
But there's a ton of
competition.

00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:10,195
There is
a ton of competition.

00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:11,797
Sure, but this is
about a brand, right?

00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:13,198
We are building
an amazing brand.

00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:14,733
We put a lot of time
into this.

00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:17,536
Yeah, but...
HERJAVEC: You guys are
obviously really smart guys,

00:27:17,536 --> 00:27:20,339
but, I mean, I can't
go along for the ride

00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:22,107
unless I buy
into the concept.
what are you
doubting?

00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:24,676
Personally,
I love to eat healthy,

00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:28,680
but I wouldn't order something
that I have to cook.

00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,848
Cooking is believing.

00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:31,917
When people try this,
they come back.

00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:33,852
This is a game-changer,

00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:36,021
because it allows you
to have an experience

00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:37,623
you would not have
otherwise.

00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:41,260
All right, Josh, look,
you've had great answers.

00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,596
I just can't get over
having to make it.

00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:48,534
I can't invest in something that
I would not use on some level.

00:27:48,534 --> 00:27:49,902
We'll send you
a free trial,

00:27:49,902 --> 00:27:52,237
and we'd like to get
your feedback afterwards.
please do.

00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:54,706
Send it to his wife.
She definitely wears
the pants in the family.

00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:56,108
I've seen her.
[ laughter ]

00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:57,743
my wife wouldn't use it,
and I wouldn't use it.

00:27:57,743 --> 00:27:59,611
You know, for that reason,
I'm out.

00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:02,681
O'LEARY:
The question is,

00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,450
how much of a premium am I,
as an investor,

00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:09,288
paying for the risk that this is
not proprietary anywhere?

00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:16,528
I think I could do the whole
thing for 3 million bucks.

00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,264
Instead, I have to pay
three times that multiple

00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:20,332
to play with you.

00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:26,405
Go find two hard chargers
who are smart, data-driven,

00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:29,107
and are gonna knock it
out of the park
we'll beat you
to it.

00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:31,176
Like the way we're gonna
knock it out of the park,

00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:32,945
we will crush whoever
you bring on board.

00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:34,079
I'm out.

00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:38,951
GREINER:
You know what? I cook a lot.

00:28:38,951 --> 00:28:40,686
The trouble I'm having
with this

00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:42,421
is that if you're
somebody who cooks --

00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:45,290
and I think most people
in America cook --

00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,259
if you do, you don't
really need somebody

00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:49,661
to send you in a box
the ingredients,

00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:50,862
'cause you go
to the grocery store --

00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:51,997
CORCORAN:
That's not their customer.

00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:52,898
Wait, wait.
Wait, wait.

00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:54,266
Yeah, it is,
though, Barb.

00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:55,734
I was wondering
if it was more
urban-centered.

00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:56,768
It is, though.
Think about it.

00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:58,170
Like, instead of going
and ordering takeout

00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,605
and eating that greasy
thing of Thai food --

00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:01,139
but you still
have to cook it.

00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:03,308
That's where I have
a little bit of difficulty.

00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:05,944
I'm seeing it as
your customer is somebody

00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:11,383
who's too busy to cook,
so for that reason, I'm out.

00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:16,855
Who do you see as your
biggest competition right now

00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:17,889
and your greatest threat?

00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:19,358
Takeout.

00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:20,892
Well,
that's pretty big.

00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:24,563
Takeout is your enemy,
and that's a big one.

00:29:24,563 --> 00:29:27,232
And you know what takeout
has over your concept?

00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:29,735
You can decide tonight what
you're in the mood for eating

00:29:29,735 --> 00:29:31,937
and get it to your table
and eat within the hour.

00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:34,740
It's done.
So that is an obstacle.

00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,142
This isn't for me.
I'm out.

00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,815
Guys, I would not be
a customer.

00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:46,551
That said, I don't have
to be a customer

00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:49,021
for a lot of things
that I take interest in.

00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:51,423
The real question is,
how do you preempt competition?

00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:53,792
How do you make this
so that it's an actual company,

00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,294
as opposed to
turning it into

00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:58,196
a feature from any
of the high-end supermarkets?

00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:00,465
So, to touch on that, the
back-end logistics are not easy.

00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,868
Also, we're signing customers
up for yearlong contracts.

00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:04,202
Okay, tell us
about that.

00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:07,039
You can either buy just
à LA carte, whenever you'd like,

00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,074
or you can subscribe
and save.

00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:10,742
And how many subscribers
do you have to that?

00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,244
Several thousand.
Okay.

00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:14,279
But this is another beauty of
the business, by the way.

00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:17,549
We don't need a lot of customers
to make this a giant business.

00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:26,658
Okay, so, guys,
I'll make you an offer.

00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:32,097
I'm gonna offer you $500,000
at the $9 million valuation,

00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:36,268
which is about 5.5%, 5.6%.
we'll figure that out.

00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:39,137
And in addition,
I want advisory shares.

00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:42,040
Whatever the best deal you give
to any of your other advisers --

00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,008
that's what I want.

00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:48,013
Do we have a deal?

00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:51,283
TARANTO: So, you're
talking about 500k

00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:54,086
at a 9 mil, at our...
yeah. you said
you left it open.

00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:57,823
...What we were looking for,
at our valuation.
Yeah. Exactly.

00:30:57,823 --> 00:30:59,658
Can we talk about it
real quick?

00:30:59,658 --> 00:31:00,859
Why do you need to talk?

00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,361
You basically told us
this is what you want,

00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:03,829
so either you want
to do business --

00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:06,164
we want you to be
a part of this, but we
need to just make sure

00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:07,933
that our numbers
are working with...
I wouldn't
leave that room

00:31:07,933 --> 00:31:09,835
with that kind of
a deal on the table.
...that we're on
the same page.

00:31:09,835 --> 00:31:11,536
CUBAN: Seriously, though,
I mean, what am I missing here?

00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,271
Because you said you wanted
advisory support.

00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:15,107
Right.
Yeah.

00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:16,842
I mean, I don't know what
there is to talk about,

00:31:16,842 --> 00:31:18,944
because I'm giving you
pretty much what you asked for.

00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:24,216
Yeah. Yeah.
I'd be happy
with that.

00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:25,817
Deal.
Let's do it.
All right.

00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:27,953
Fantastic.
Appreciate it, guys.
I might even learn
how to pound meat.

00:31:27,953 --> 00:31:29,087
Super excited.

00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:30,822
Can we hug it out,
man?
Hug it out, baby.

00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:31,890
[ both laugh ]

00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,792
Thank you,
guys.
Pleasure.

00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:34,793
Good job.
Thanks, guys.

00:31:34,793 --> 00:31:35,827
All right, thanks,
Mark.

00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:36,995
CUBAN:
See you guys. Thanks, guys.

00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:38,096
Bye.

00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:39,931
I'll take that.
Yeah, brother.

00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:42,334
Hey, there was no doubt these
guys had a solid business, Mark.

00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:43,468
There's no doubt
about that.

00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:44,936
Yep. I mean, look,
there's risks,

00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:46,238
as there are
to any business,

00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:47,839
but in this
particular case,

00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:50,776
the horse is a decent horse,
the jockeys are great jockeys.

00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:52,577
And you might learn
to cook, Mark.

00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:55,213
I'm not gonna learn
how to cook, ever.

00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:56,314
[ laughs ]

00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:09,194
I'm John.
I'm Sal.
I'm Anthony.

00:32:09,194 --> 00:32:11,196
[ laughter ]
Sal and I
are cousins.

00:32:11,196 --> 00:32:12,764
Me and Anthony,
best friends.

00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,332
Put together,
we're like brothers.

00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:15,467
How's my booboo?
Mwah.

00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:16,968
We come from
New York City.

00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:19,771
Rough neighborhood,
rough growing up for all of us.

00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,240
We could have went the wrong way
very easily, but we didn't.

00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,975
I work as a New York City
firefighter.

00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:26,077
I've been on the job
for nine years now.

00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:28,313
As a firefighter,
I have a lot of free time,

00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:30,949
so to supplement my income,
I started a painting business.

00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,051
Don't even think --
don't even think of rolling.

00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:34,619
Stop.
Painting's
in our genes.

00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,154
Long line of painters
right here.

00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:39,024
Being painters, we always
had this one problem,

00:32:39,024 --> 00:32:40,592
and one day, we just said,
"enough's enough."

00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:42,961
together, we have developed
the most revolutionary product

00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,529
the painting industry
has ever seen.

00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:45,530
Boom.
Got it.
[ laughs ]

00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,832
boom!

00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:48,867
Running this business has been
a total team effort,

00:32:48,867 --> 00:32:50,068
but I must say,

00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:52,003
our backs are a little
against the ropes right now.

00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:53,605
Striking a deal
with a shark

00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:56,241
would just be an absolute
game-changer for us.

00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:59,411
We're at that critical stage.
We're so close to making it.

00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:01,480
Somebody like a shark
to push us over the edge

00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,914
is really all we need.

00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:19,631
Hi, sharks.
I'm Sal depaola.

00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:20,932
I'm
John depaola.

00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:22,367
I'm
Anthony Caputo.

00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:24,603
Our company is called
liquid concepts,

00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:26,137
creators of
the paint brush cover.

00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:28,773
We're here today
seeking $50,000

00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:30,809
for a 10% stake
in our company.

00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:34,246
Sharks, the three of us
have been painting

00:33:34,246 --> 00:33:35,614
for a very long
time.

00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:37,849
In fact, together,
we have over 60 years

00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,784
professional painting
experience.

00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:42,587
Through the years, one thing
has bothered us most.

00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:45,123
Every time we put down
our brush...

00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:46,391
Oh, man.

00:33:49,995 --> 00:33:52,597
Hey, come on.
Don't be silly. Listen.

00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:54,499
Every time you put down
the brush, there's a problem.

00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:56,234
Every time we put down the
brush, there was a problem.

00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:57,602
Anyone who paints
can relate.

00:33:57,602 --> 00:34:01,106
Whether you get a phone call,
you need to take a lunch break,

00:34:01,106 --> 00:34:02,574
you have to pick up
the kids from school.

00:34:02,574 --> 00:34:04,943
There has never been
a reasonable or convenient way

00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:07,812
to keep your brush from drying
out or getting ruined until now.

00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:10,081
Me and cousin Johnny --
Johnny boy over here

00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:12,517
went to work in his lab --
A.K.A. his garage --

00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:14,386
and developed
what has become

00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:17,856
the most revolutionary
prototype...

00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:19,891
Painting product
in the industry.

00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:23,028
[ laughter, applause ]
Sal, you did
a great job!

00:34:23,028 --> 00:34:24,029
You did it!

00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:25,430
Slow down. Slow down.

00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:28,934
It's not like we invented a
robot that's gonna paint for us.

00:34:28,934 --> 00:34:31,770
We did, however, revolutionize
the painting industry

00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,905
with one piece of plastic.

00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,341
Introducing the
paint brush cover.

00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,845
You sharks might be thinking
you've seen this before.

00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:42,647
You sharks haven't.

00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:45,617
In fact, maybe you're thinking,
why didn't you think of it?

00:34:45,617 --> 00:34:48,253
We got you covered.
  we thought of it.

00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:50,055
CAPUTO:
The days of plastic wrap

00:34:50,055 --> 00:34:52,190
and other makeshift
coverings are over.

00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,759
With the paint brush cover's
unique, airtight design,

00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,395
it allows you to store
your wet brush for days, weeks,

00:34:57,395 --> 00:35:00,932
even months without
that wet brush drying out,

00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:04,636
saving anyone who paints a lot
of time and a lot of money.

00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:06,171
Johnny, hang on
a sec.

00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:08,406
Are you telling me all I have
to do is put my brush in there

00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:10,775
and it doesn't dry up?

00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,777
That's it.
Never dries out.
Not only does it not dry out,

00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,613
but we've tested it
for as long as three months.

00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,114
Really?
It stays wet.

00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,017
In fact, we have one here
that's been through the mill,

00:35:19,017 --> 00:35:21,353
and it's still wet.

00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:24,222
I find it hard to believe
that this little plastic cover

00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:25,824
keeps the paintbrush for days.

00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:29,094
Well, it holds almost
100% humidity inside of there.

00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:30,929
Picture tupperware.

00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:32,130
If I was to take paint
out of a can

00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,565
and put it into tupperware
and close it,

00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:36,101
you could put it on the shelf,
come back to it, open it up.

00:35:36,101 --> 00:35:37,769
It's not gonna be dry.
It's gonna be wet.

00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:39,571
It's such a great idea.

00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:42,874
If it's such a great idea,
how many have you sold?

00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:44,943
We've sold 17,000.

00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:46,411
Wow.
And how many dollars
is that?

00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:48,213
$35,000.

00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:49,581
50% of that revenue

00:35:49,581 --> 00:35:51,349
has come in over the course
of the past three months.

00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:53,385
How much does it cost you
to make it right now?

00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:54,786
41 cents a unit.

00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:56,154
And you sell it for $2?

00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,289
Correct.
And to a retailer
for 2 bucks.

00:35:58,289 --> 00:35:59,557
What do they sell it for?

00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:00,759
$3.99.
$3.99 target price.

00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:03,128
How do you sell them?
To who?

00:36:03,128 --> 00:36:05,830
We started off, obviously,
just door to door.

00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,033
Old-fashioned.
Come on.

00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:09,267
And nobody said no.

00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:10,835
We went to three stores
this morning.

00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,971
We went to three stores
this morning. It's true.
Did you sell any?

00:36:12,971 --> 00:36:15,340
Every store.
Every store.

00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,977
Have you tried to sell
to Lowe's or Home Depot

00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:20,578
or one of the Lar--

00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:21,980
we're talking to Walmart
right now.

00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:25,417
We have distributors in six
different countries right now.

00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:27,052
So, you're saying

00:36:27,052 --> 00:36:28,853
that there's nothing else
out there like this?

00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,689
No.
Not an
airtight one.

00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:33,058
How is that possible?
That's what we were saying!
How is that possible?

00:36:33,058 --> 00:36:35,093
I've been thinking --
how could no one
have thought of this?

00:36:35,093 --> 00:36:38,396
None of you sound that smart.
Who thought of it?
[ laughter ]

00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,365
which one's Moe,
which one's Larry,
which one's curly, right?

00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,700
Listen, we've both
been painting.

00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,967
We're tired of wrapping
in wrap.

00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:44,736
Yeah, but who said,
"I have an idea"?

00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:46,671
He did.
I've been thinking of this
for about 10 years.

00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:48,840
I knew it, and you're
the best-looking one,
too. You got both.

00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,975
[ laughter ]

00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:52,977
What are you guys
gonna use the money for?

00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:55,180
Number one is
to restock inventory.

00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,514
We have letters of intent

00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:58,683
into the hundreds
of thousands of units.

00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:00,952
Bunnings happens to be
the Home Depot of Australia.

00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:02,454
We're in talks right now

00:37:02,454 --> 00:37:06,891
with a buyer for bunnings who
wanted a quote for 250 pallets.

00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,394
What's that in total dollars?
What's that in total dollars?

00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:10,929
It was about
$450,000.

00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:13,498
Okay, so that raises
a big red flag, guys.

00:37:13,498 --> 00:37:15,300
Why did you only ask
for $50,000,

00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,469
knowing that
you might have a sale

00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:20,371
that would require you
to put up a lot of cash?

00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:23,675
Because we feel confident
enough in our company

00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:26,544
where we don't want to give up
that much equity.
but we feel --

00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:28,813
that's smart. that's smart.
equity is very expensive,

00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:30,415
particularly
if you have a winner.

00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,083
You know he's gonna
offer you a royalty deal.

00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,485
I'll tell you what I'll do
with you guys, all right?

00:37:33,485 --> 00:37:34,686
Yeah,
there we go.

00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:37,055
I like what you're doing.
I like the product.

00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:42,427
I'll give you $50,000 for 10%
royalty on all of your sales,

00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:45,363
and I think you're gonna need
more money, guys.

00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:46,397
I really do.

00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:47,665
So you'll
offer us more.

00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:49,567
Yeah, well, I'm gonna start
with what you asked for.

00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:51,736
I'll give you
$50,000 for 10%,

00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:53,738
then I'm gonna help you raise
what you're going to need

00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:54,739
to fund this inventory.

00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:56,207
And I would help you
get into retail.

00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:57,776
I think this is
a very interesting story.

00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,444
Thank you.

00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,880
So, Johnny, I'm curious to see
what you think

00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,414
about the royalty thing.
yeah.

00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:05,250
I like it,
and I respect it.

00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,285
CORCORAN:
Smart guy.
I mean, with that
being said --

00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,553
you're open
to other offers.

00:38:08,553 --> 00:38:10,255
I'm open
to other offers.
We're
open-minded.

00:38:10,255 --> 00:38:11,823
And you guys got to give me
a little more space,

00:38:11,823 --> 00:38:12,724
'cause I keep hitting
my shoulders.

00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:13,858
You know,
I need my space.

00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:15,059
All right.

00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:16,628
You're saying the company's
worth $500,000.

00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:17,762
Correct.

00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:21,533
I'll give you the $50,000
for 20%.

00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:26,304
That's much more expensive
than a royalty.

00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,006
Way more expensive.

00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:30,341
You started at somewhere.
I'm starting somewhere.

00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:32,076
Gotcha.
Yeah.

00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:33,511
Kevin, in regards
to your royalty,

00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:34,879
what will you focus
on our business

00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:36,314
to help us move forward?

00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,316
O'LEARY: You know, the great
thing about a royalty deal

00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,618
is it incentivizes us
and aligns it together,

00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:42,754
because the only thing
I want is sales.

00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:45,290
So, for me,
what I would be doing

00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:49,160
is focusing on big-box partners
and getting it in the store.

00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,596
So I only make money
if we sell the product.

00:38:51,596 --> 00:38:53,164
Even if they're not
profitable sales.

00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,400
Right.
Right.

00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,468
But you can decide whether
to take the sale or not.

00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:59,537
I can bring the buyer
to you very easily.

00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:02,841
And if he doesn't bring
any sales --
he's not invested in
the success of the company.

00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,275
Listen, talk is cheap.
Money talks.

00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:05,310
That's what matters.

00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:06,678
You understand
exactly what I'm saying.

00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:07,912
We know that.

00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:09,581
If they can come up
with a better structure --

00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:11,316
but when you start
giving away equity,

00:39:11,316 --> 00:39:13,318
in the long run,
that's incredibly expensive.

00:39:13,318 --> 00:39:17,589
We understand that.
I personally would
just love to know

00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:19,691
that you're invested
in the company as well.

00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:25,663
All right, I'll make it
more interesting for you.

00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:27,031
I'll give you $100,000.

00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,033
I'll leave my royalty in place,
but I want 5% equity.

00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,135
That aligns us even further.

00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:33,371
I do everything in my power
to get us more sales.

00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,139
I get my 10%
every time a unit's sold.

00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:36,274
That's about 20 cents.

00:39:36,274 --> 00:39:38,009
That's how I start
to recoup my capital.

00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:41,913
What do you want to do?

00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,517
GREINER:
Wait a minute.

00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:48,786
I'm going to make you
an offer.

00:39:57,328 --> 00:40:01,499
NARRATOR: Sal, John,
and Anthony have two offers.

00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:04,969
Robert has offered $50,000
for 20% equity.

00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:08,106
Kevin has offered $100,000
for 5% equity,

00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:11,676
plus a royalty of 10%.

00:40:11,676 --> 00:40:14,379
But Lori is also interested.

00:40:14,379 --> 00:40:16,147
What do you want to do?

00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:18,149
GREINER:
Wait a minute.

00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:19,384
I'm going to make you
an offer.

00:40:20,685 --> 00:40:25,490
I'll give you $100,000
at 20%,

00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:29,460
plus, if you just
take the deal right now,

00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:33,431
I'll add another $100,000
that will go towards

00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,934
paying for the first
purchase orders

00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,535
if we need excess money,

00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:39,804
'cause we're gonna be
out there so fast.

00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:43,775
So, Lori, is that your offer --
$200,000 for 20%?

00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,677
It's an offer in front
of you right now.

00:40:45,677 --> 00:40:47,178
If you take it
right now.

00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:49,314
And you're gonna do everything
in your power to get us on QVC.

00:40:49,314 --> 00:40:50,715
Oh, you know it.
QVC, Walmart.

00:40:50,715 --> 00:40:52,684
Get us and -- picking up
the phone and be saying,

00:40:52,684 --> 00:40:53,718
"hey, you know what?

00:40:53,718 --> 00:40:55,553
"Walmart, listen,
these are our guys.

00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:59,023
This is it."
Lowe's, menards, Home Depot --
everywhere, lightning speed.

00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:02,694
And I have another offer.
I'm gonna give you $100,000 --

00:41:02,694 --> 00:41:05,296
guys, if you listen
to this offer,

00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,198
there's an expiration date
on that extra $100,000.

00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:10,134
I don't know if you heard me say
my offer's a better offer,

00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,637
and you haven't heard
from Cuban either.
I would listen.

00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,472
I wouldn't listen.

00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:19,344
You'll wonder the rest of your
life what you turned away.
You guys know what I can do.
You've studied all of us.

00:41:19,344 --> 00:41:21,512
You know what each one of us
brings to the table.

00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:24,349
I guarantee you my
offer's better than that.
It's a no-lose situation.

00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:25,883
I love you guys, and I will put
my heart and soul into this.

00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:27,318
My offer is that you have
to take it now, though.

00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,088
And you haven't heard
our two offers yet.

00:41:36,094 --> 00:41:37,762
We know
what we want to do.
We know.

00:41:37,762 --> 00:41:38,763
Go get it.

00:41:38,763 --> 00:41:40,098
All right.

00:41:43,768 --> 00:41:45,703
Lori, welcome
to the family.
[ gasps ]
Yay!

00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:47,638
Ah, crap.
What?!

00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:50,308
Sorry, Barbara.
JOHN:
No offense, Barbara.
That is great.

00:41:50,308 --> 00:41:51,876
"sorry, Barbara"!
You're breaking my heart!
This is awesome.

00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:53,911
There you go.
You guys are great.
Sorry.

00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:55,013
You should have listened.

00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:57,582
You should have listened.

00:41:57,582 --> 00:41:58,950
Isn't that awesome?

00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,985
JOHN:
All right, boys.

00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:02,186
[ laughs ]
We did it.

00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,254
Yeah, baby.

00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:05,356
You know what?
They're not so smart.

00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:08,292
I was offering them $300,000
with a $500,000 credit.

00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:10,328
Well, they were smart.
They took mine.

00:42:10,328 --> 00:42:13,297
No, they weren't smart.
They short-sold themselves.
Yeah, they were.

00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:14,198
I scooped you.

00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,334
I'm really pissed,
Lori.

00:42:16,334 --> 00:42:18,436
We're not making enough noise.
Come on.

00:42:18,436 --> 00:42:19,537
Whoo!
Whoo.

00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,005
CAPUTO: Making a deal
with Lori's like

00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:22,407
being up in the bottom
of the ninth

00:42:22,407 --> 00:42:24,275
and hitting a grand slam
to win the World Series.

00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:26,110
This was a total home run
for us.
