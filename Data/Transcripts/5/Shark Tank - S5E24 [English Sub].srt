with a very small, one-time fee,
about $50,000.

00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:01,054
We'll be able to not only make
those adjustments.

00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,622
We will be able
to simplify payroll.

00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:05,025
I would've preferred you
came into the Shark Tank

00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,426
with all of that worked out

00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:10,030
and you just needed to pour
gasoline on a proven model.

00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,231
That's not what we got here.

00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:12,365
Okay.

00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,633
You should've fixed this stuff

00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,602
and then come in here saying,
"I fixed it all.

00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,370
I need $100,000
to pour gasoline on it."

00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,172
I would've been interested.

00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:21,007
I'm not interested in this.

00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:21,942
I'm out.

00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:26,980
Sir, what we've got here
is sales.

00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,082
Right.
We've got a proven interest,

00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:30,750
a massive proven interest
in our --

00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,319
in our product
and in our service.

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,887
You're very, very close.

00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,455
There's -- there's a lot
of holes in the Dike,

00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,657
and you've identified
where they all are.
right.

00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:40,927
But putting the putty in there
or putting a finger in there,

00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:42,462
that's a little bit
more complicated

00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,197
than I think
you're giving it credit for.

00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,967
Sure.
Because if it goes wrong...

00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:50,036
Where are you?
You're back in the same hole.

00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:51,171
Sure, sure.

00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:52,706
Right, and so you're
a little bit too early,

00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:54,374
and so for that reason,
I'm out.

00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:59,813
Right, absolutely, and I --
I think it's spectacular advice.

00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,648
Taylor,
I think you're close.

00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:02,882

the big jump today.

Sure, sure.
I'm out.

00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:17,230
Taylor, I'm an investor
on a very similar product

00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,699
called game changer
meetings.

00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:20,567
Okay.
You go on there.

00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:21,601
You want to meet
a supermodel

00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:22,969
to show you
how to walk down the runway.

00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:25,071
Right.
Anybody can show you
how to walk down the runway,

00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,007
but if you want a supermodel,
it's $4,000.

00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,475
HERJAVEC: Wow!

00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:30,043
I think your positioning
is absolutely wrong.

00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:32,312
Mm.
I think you're working hard
and not smart,

00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:35,081
and for those reasons,
I'm out.

GREINER:
In my business on QVC,

00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,823
I have to convince somebody
in four minutes

00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,559
why they should pick up
the phone, why they should buy,

00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,896
and as you've been standing
here, you didn't do that.

00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,298
I find there's
so much confusion.

00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:53,533
I'm out.

00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,671
All right.

00:08:58,671 --> 00:08:59,739
Appreciate it, man.
Thank you.

00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,641
Darn it.

00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,146
I don't know if I want some guy
who was in a rock band

to teach my daughter how
to play an instrument.

00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,183
Well, hey, man,
we gave it all we got.

00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:11,518
It's their loss.

00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:13,520
ROBINSON: Even though
we didn't get a deal today,

00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,021
I'm encouraged to move forward.

00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,824
They seemed like they liked me
and they liked the business,

00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:19,959
and we're just gonna keep doing
what we do.

00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,540
NARRATOR: Next into the tank
are two friends

00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,942
with a unique way
to create your own energy.

00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:47,854
Hi.
I'm David Toledo.

00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,155
And I'm Caleb Light.

00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:52,425
Our company is Power Practical,
creators of the Powerpot.

00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,395
We're seeking
a $250,000 investment

00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:57,063
for 10% equity
in our company.

00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:59,132
We know that
just about everyone

00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:00,667
knows how to boil
a pot of water

00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:03,503
and charge their phone,
but what if I told you

00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:05,672
you could charge your phone
from a pot of boiling water?

00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:08,308
Our first product
is the Powerpot.

00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:09,776
It takes fire and water

00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,178
and makes power
with no moving parts.

00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,013
It's a great solution
which we use

00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,982
to generate portable,
on-demand power

00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,618
because it works day,
night, rain, or shine.

00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,720
The best part is,
it's super easy to use.

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,289
And I'm gonna show you
how easy it is to use.

00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,158
You simply take
your Powerpot.

00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:28,261
You add water to the pot.
You fire up your stove.

00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:31,631
You take your regulator cord.
You plug it into the back.

00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,932
And as you can see,
in a matter of seconds,

00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,000
you're making power.

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,201
Wow.

00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,137
The Powerpot is
an incredible innovation

00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,705
that is a simple
cooking vessel

00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:40,974
that now doubles as
a mini renewable power plant.

00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,942
Who wants to join our team
and keep charging?

00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,011
Pretty cool, guys.
Can we see the packaging?

00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:46,312
Very cool.
Yeah, okay.

00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,381
You don't need to put water
in it, do you?

00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:49,415
TOLEDO: You -- you do need
to put water in it.

00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:50,683
Why?

00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,852
So, the Powerpot
is a thermoelectric generator,

00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,988
which means it takes
a temperature difference

00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,422
from the bottom
of the pot.

00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,625
And whatever's inside,
which should be water,

00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,761
and turns it into electricity
with no moving parts.

00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,096
So, as the water heats up,

00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:05,165
it becomes less efficient
in generating electricity?

00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:08,134
Yes. So, as the temperature
difference decreases,

00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:09,602
it produces less power.

00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:12,305
So, Caleb, how long
would it power something?

00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:15,108
The Powerpot output's 5 Watts,
or 1 amp, of current,

00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,744
so that means 90% of
the USB devices will charge

00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:20,079
just as quickly
as at home.

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,583
O'LEARY:
Is there anything protected,
or anybody can do this?

00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,552
So, we filed a patent
in 2010,

00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:27,654
and it's been published,
and it's still pending.

00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:29,589
I can't even cook a hot dog
in this thing.

00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:31,724
[ laughs ]

00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:33,860
Like, what's the game plan
size-wise?

00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,795
So, in terms
of the typical use case

00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,830
for someone that goes
into the outdoors...

00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,033
Yeah.
...That's a pot
that's pretty common.

00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,101
We actually have
larger-style pots.

00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:44,504
So, where have you
been selling this set?

00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,573
So, we initially launched
our company

00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:47,774
on a crowd-funding
platform.

00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:48,908
Of course.
Which one?

00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:50,843
Kickstarter, and --
what did you raise?

00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:55,381
We set out to raise 50 grand
in 30 days, and we raised 126.

00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,283
Okay.
We pre-sold
roughly 1,000 units.

00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,319
What do you guys want
to do with the money?

00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:00,954
So, we want to do
three things.

00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:02,522
We want to sell
more product.

00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:04,157
We want to get
into more doors,

00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:05,858
which we need to hire
a few more people.

00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,193
Second thing
we want to do is,

00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,229
we're doing some testing
with some big-box stores,

00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,030
and so we need to assist
in the sell-through

00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,198
with some point of sale.

00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,933
And then the third thing
we want to do is,

00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,902
we want to continue
to expand our product line.

00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,538
You're asking for $250,000
for 10%,

00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:20,139
and you're valuing
the company at $2.5 million.

00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,207
Yep.

00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,142
And you've sold
$300,000 worth of goods.

00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:24,444
This year.
This year.

00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:27,146
Have you got any orders
from outdoor retailers?

00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:30,183
Yeah, we are in over 100
different doors right now.

00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:35,088
Beyond a niche product,
how big is this market?

00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,790
Like, what could
your sales be next year?

00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,726
We're projecting to be
in the range

00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,461
of about $2 million
next year.

00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:44,197
[ laughter ]

00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:46,032
But there
are some solar companies

00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:49,035
that are doing tens of millions
of dollars of sales every year.

00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:52,071
So, when I was a teenager,
I was a camp counselor,

00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:56,209
and I used to take
two-week trips without any food.

00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:58,511
We'd go out
into the wilderness.

00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:01,247
I have very unfond memories
of that time.

00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,316

I enjoy the great outdoors
a lot, and I know roughing it.

So when I go out and I rough it
with my Range Rover,

00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,926
But at
a $2.5-million value...

00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:22,795
You're asking
for $250,000 for 10%?

00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:23,830
Mm-hmm.

00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,031
I think
you've already priced it

00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,199
in the size
of that market.

00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,201
I don't see a way for me
to participate today.

00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,435
I'm out.

00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:33,973
Okay, thanks, Robert.

00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,375
And then there was one.

NARRATOR:
Four sharks are out.

00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:56,396
Mark Cuban is Powerpot's
last chance for a deal.

00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,297
And then there was one.
[ laughs ]

00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,766
CUBAN: Where do you see
the company in three years?

00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:01,367
What other applications
do you see for that?

00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:02,502
LIGHT:
The emerging markets?

00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:04,203
That's a market that we see

00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,973
could be a huge benefit
on our side, and --

00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:08,341
you mean like
third-world application?

00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:11,778
TOLEDO: We have Powerpots
in Uganda with a nonprofit.

00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,112
They're keeping track
of them,

00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,881
finding out what people
are using them for.

00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:16,783
But just their phones,
right? Just being able to --

00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:18,251
that's what we thought
it was gonna be.

00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,318
It was gonna be phones,

00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,053
but that ends up
not being the case.

00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:22,288
What is the case?

00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,490
In Uganda, because
they have a fire indoor,

00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,558
they want lights.

00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,231
What are you gonna do,
Mark?

00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,307
The pot's boiling.

00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:42,742
I know.
LIGHT: The pot's boiling.

00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:44,710
[ Greiner laughs ]
And it's charging.

00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,813
Guys, I like
what you're doing.

00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:50,450
Um...I like
the social aspects of it.

00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,551
I just get the sense

00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,119
that you've got
all the pieces you need.

00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,153
We see tons of value

00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,288
in bringing someone like you
to the table.

00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:58,724
So, closing a round
with you means

00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:01,394
we potentially will never have
to raise money again ever.

00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:03,863
Since you guys
are smart [laughs]

00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:05,765
I'll offer you
250k for 20%.

00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:06,699
For 20%?

00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,534
Yeah.
Ooh!

00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:15,575
Well, Mark,
we have investors

00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,143
that have already put money up
to the table.

00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,612
We put a tremendous amount
of value in that.

00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:21,781
We feel like that would
not be very good for --

00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:24,050
so you see no value in all
the stuff you just said

00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,285
that was so great about Mark?
is that what you're saying?

00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,254
No, no, no, no.
I just am saying that --

00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:29,555
well, you cut
the value in half.

00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,357
O'LEARY: But a shark brings
more than just money,

00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:32,725
and I think you made
reference to that.

00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,126
Well, we -- we still see
GREINER: Right.

00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,361
A lot of value
in bringing on Mark.

00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,230
You don't see that much.
You only see 10% value.

00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:41,234
O'LEARY: There's many
venture-capital firms out there.

00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:43,302
There's only one Shark Tank.

00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:55,181
So what if we did 12% equity
for $250,000,

00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:59,185
plus another 3%
of advisor options

00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,653
and offer a seat
on our board?

00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,599
You got a deal.

00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,235
Whoo! Yeah!

00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:17,303
Wow.

00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:18,604
If it's a good company,
it's a good company.

00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:19,639
Congratulations.
Good job.

00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:21,007
Mr. Cuban,
we appreciate it.

00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:22,241
They even called you
"Mr. Cuban."

00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,309
I don't like that.
I like "Mark."

00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:24,310
Nice job, guys.

00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,112
Yeah, boy!
[ grunts ]

00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:27,446
Whoo!
Try that again.

00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:30,149
HERJAVEC: That was
a good one, Mark.

00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,384
Good kids.
That was
a really good product.

00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:32,652
CUBAN:
It's a good company.

00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:34,487
I just hate camping
so much.

00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,627
NARRATOR: On the very first
episode of "Shark Tank,"

00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,796
Tiffany krummins brought
a homemade prototype

00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:46,632
of her children's medicine
dispenser, Ava the elephant,

00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:49,602
into the tank, and she struck
a deal with Barbara Corcoran.

00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:50,937
You know what?
I'd love to take your offer.

00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:52,505
We're gonna make money
on this together.

00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:54,507
NARRATOR:
Let's see how she's doing now.

00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:56,642
Okay, guys, let's make
these a priority.

00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,444
KRUMMINS: You know,
I really still can't believe

00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,346
that Barbara took a gamble
on me that first episode.

00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:01,647
Five years ago,

00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,449
I walked into the Shark Tank
as green as it comes.

00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,418
I'm trying to play hardball.
Can you tell?

00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,853
Barbara kind of took me
under her wing

00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:11,290
and helped me transform my
prototype into a real product.

00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,060
All of this happened while
I was battling thyroid cancer.

00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,496
I truly believe that my business
was a great motivator

00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:19,298
to fight cancer and beat it.

00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:22,034
Today, I am so happy
and thankful to report

00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:24,604
that I am still cancer-free.

00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,973
The biggest thing
that's happened in my business

00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:29,408
is a connection with a company
called healthpons.

00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:31,243
Healthpons is so important to me

00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,779
because they have unlimited
resources and connections

00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,081
with doctors and hospitals.

00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:36,649
They have allowed me
to get into doors

00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,084
that I could not
get into before.

00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:40,586
We already have
confirmed purchase orders

00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:44,056
for over $6 million in hospitals
and doctors' offices alone.

00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,124
Patty, I'm offering you

00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,493
my entire share
in Ava the elephant.

00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:50,162
I would like to offer you
230,000 shares...

00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:51,764
Wow.
...Of healthpons.

00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:52,832
With the stock swap,

00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:54,767
I'm becoming a partner
in healthpons,

00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:57,503
and healthpons is becoming
a partner in Ava the elephant.

00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:59,939
We're taking our best resources
and putting them together.

00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:01,841
We can help
put more smiles

00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:03,876
on more
sick children's faces.

00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:07,013
WOMAN: We are presenting
to you the Phoenix award

00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:08,547
for your creation
of Ava the elephant,

00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:09,949
which has benefited
the lives

00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:11,751
of many children
across the nation.

00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,386
KRUMMINS:
To be recognized today

00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:15,021
for all of my work
with children

00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:17,156
and bringing manufacturing
to the United States

00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,791
is just phenomenal.

00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,127
KRUMMINS:
My "Shark Tank" experience
has been truly life-changing.

00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:24,764
I went from working as a nanny
to providing for my family.

00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:26,298
I'm truly touched.
Thank you.

00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:27,967
When you first saw me
on the show,

00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:29,535
my daughter was 3 months old.

00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:32,304
She has literally grown up
in this industry.

00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:33,739
It brings me to tears

00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:36,475
thinking about how proud I am to
show her that you can do this.

00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:37,710
You can follow your dreams.

This is my partner,
Kevin Ullery.

00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,661
We're from sugar grove,
Illinois,

00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,063
and we live
with our dog, Max.

00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:59,532
ULLERY: Stan and I met
when we were 25 years old,

00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,434
and it really was
love at first sight.

00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:03,502
He is
very business-oriented.

00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:05,137
I'm a lot more laid-back.

00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,039
Stan's the brains.
I'm the beauty.

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,674
I was very successful
in real estate,

00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,443
but when
the real-estate market crashed,

00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:11,844
it changed everything.

00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:13,979
And we needed to find
a new business to get into

00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,681
to bring in the cash flow
we needed.

00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,550
Watching Stan
have to shut the doors

00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,351
for the last time
was devastating.

00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:20,553
It was the hardest thing

00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,655
that we've been through
together for sure.

00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,323
How do you
like these colors?

00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,491
I think it looks good.

00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:27,059
We've always gotten along
very well,

00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,394
so we thought
it would be fun

00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,129
to start a new business
venture together.

00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:31,263
Our product is unique

00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:33,532
because every experience
is one of a kind,

00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:34,967
and we're paving the way
to new adventures.

00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:38,104
To get this business going,
we risked everything.

00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:40,239
We risked
all of our finances.

00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,742
Even our relationship
was put to the test.

00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,710
Here's to building
a new future, Stan.

00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,145
Sounds good.

00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:49,248
We've experienced firsthand
the pain of losing a business,

00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,784
so this new company is our way
of getting back on track.

00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:53,786
So, if things don't go our way
in the tank,

00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:55,554
this could be the end
of the road for us.

00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:54,213
when you were dragged
from store to store,

00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:57,183
stuck in an endless loop
of rejection and boredom.

00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:58,884
"dad, can I get
some ice cream?"

00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:00,019
"no."

00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:02,454
"mom, can I go
to the toy store?"

00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:03,556
"no, here's some money.

00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:04,924
"why don't you ride
the merry-go-round

00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:06,325
while I get myself
a new pair of shoes?"
[ snaps fingers ]

00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,060
and there
you find yourself,

00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,095
sitting on a dirty,
plastic horse,

00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:12,298
going in circles
on a trip to nowhere.

00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:13,499
That's the problem.

00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:16,068
Most malls offer
the same old attractions.

00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:18,671
Well, sharks, we've broken
the confinement barrier.

00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,639
We want you to relive
your childhood

00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,441
and imagine what trips
to the mall would've been like

00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:23,475
with a ride on...

00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,911
BOTH: The Fun Time Express!

00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:27,680
That's right.
Fun time express

00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,882
is a trackless train ride
for all ages.

00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:32,551
And we travel
through the entire mall,

00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:34,587
so it gives dads a chance
to take a break,

00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:36,121
moms a chance
to window-shop,

00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:38,324
and shopping malls
are just the beginning.

00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:40,159
Our trains
are built and equipped

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,595
to handle any event
or environment, like parks,

00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:46,699
amusement parks, sports arenas,
even private parties.

00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:49,235
Thank you, sharks. We are ready
for your questions.

00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:50,769
Is this
an existing business?

00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:52,338
Is this
a brand-new start-up?

00:22:52,338 --> 00:22:54,907
We currently have
five operational trains.

00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:56,542
Actually, a sixth one
was placed online

00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:57,476
a couple of weeks ago.

00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:59,144
This will be our lucky
number seven.

00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:00,746
Walk us through
how I make money.

00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:01,881
Monday through Thursday,

00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,382
it's like virtually
most retail businesses.

00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,050
Friday and Saturday,
basically,

00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,886
we can have
several hundred dollars,

00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:09,388
even $500 to $800
on a weekend.

00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,457
That's it --
500 bucks in two days?
What does it cost?

00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:13,392
That sucks!
What -- what is...

00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,961
Is it a nickel
to ride it?

00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:17,696
[ laughs ]

00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,565
No, it's $3
to ride a train.

00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:22,434
What's the capital expenditure
to buy the train?

00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:23,769
Each train
is about $37,500.

00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:25,471
Believe it or not,
six to eight months

00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:26,872
is the expected
projected time

00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,908
to pay off a train in full
from net proceeds.

00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,209
HERJAVEC: Stan, do you --
correct, and that's
the beauty about it.

00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:31,176
There's limited overhead.

00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:32,878
Stan, so, what
do you pay the mall?

00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:37,116
Malls are basically
individually negotiated leases.

00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:40,085
Last year, what did you gross,
and what was your net?

00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,321
Well, we started in 2011.

00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:44,757
We've sold 31,000 tickets.

00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,458
So you did about $95,000?

00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:49,094
We did about $106,000
in gross revenues.

00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,196
About $47,000
was net profits.

00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,065
Okay.
In 2012, we doubled.

00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:56,235
We actually went to about
62,000 in ticket sales.

00:23:56,235 --> 00:23:58,938
We went to about $216,000
in gross revenues,

00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:02,541
and we went to a little over
$80,000 roughly in net profits.

00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:05,044
Next year, with all seven
trains fully operational,

00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:07,980
we're projecting at selling
over 300,000 tickets.

00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,214
GREINER: $3 a ride.

00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:10,950
I'm just curious where
you picked that number from.

00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,751
$3 seems
to be the magic number.

00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:15,454
In November, December,
like many stores do,

00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,990
you could boost up
to one ticket for $5,

00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,224
two for $8,
three for $10,

00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:20,726
and we have done that
in one mall.

00:24:20,726 --> 00:24:22,728
Yeah, look, you've got
constrained capacity.

00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:24,997
You've got 24
or 28 seats, right?

00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:26,098
Absolutely.

00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:27,900
And so your ability
to change your prices

00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,468
expands by the traffic
in the mall.

00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,970
Absolutely.
Sure thing.

00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,671
So variable pricing
is the wave of the future.

00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:33,639
I'm glad
you're on top of it.

00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:34,773
But the bigger issue is,

00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:36,542
it's not really
a scalable business, right?

00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,845
It's tough to grow this.

00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:43,782
You could add more malls.

00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:45,217
Well, of course
you get more malls,

00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:46,518
but then the more malls
you get,

00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:48,053
the more people you need
to manage them,

00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:49,254
the more people
you have to manage,

00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:50,356
all the people
you have driving the trains,

00:24:50,356 --> 00:24:51,457
maintaining the trains.

00:24:51,457 --> 00:24:53,625
Even though I realize
over multiple years,

00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:56,528
it might be a nice little income
for an individual operator,

00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:59,164
from an investor's perspective
who's looking to get a return

00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,100
in addition to what
you're looking to get,

00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,835
that makes it
more difficult,

00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,103
and so for that reason,
I'm out.

00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,507
JOHN: You know, I grew up --

00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,909
I grew up riding trains
a lot as a kid,

00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:14,346
but they were the f-trains, so,
you know, I would get on there.

00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,281
I was flashed by a vagrant,
my pockets would be picked,

00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:18,250
and I'd have bedbugs by the time
I'd get off the train.

00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,318
[ laughter ]

00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:20,419
Yeah.
Ew!

00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:21,520
Oh, boy.
Ew.

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,788
That was the f train --
New York City.

00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:24,256
So, I want to believe in this.

00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:25,891
But I took my kids on something

00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:27,793
like this at the carnival,
right?

00:25:27,793 --> 00:25:30,896
By the time I was done,
both of my kids

00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:32,698
were playing online poker
on their smartphones.

00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:33,632
They couldn't care less.

00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:38,971
It's just not a model for me.
I'm out.

00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:43,308
We understand.
Thank you for the audience.

00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:44,510
We appreciate it.
Thank you so much.

00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,178
O'LEARY: What every shark
is struggling with

00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:49,214
is a scalability
and the actual return.

00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,883
I mean,
it's -- it's sort of --

00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:52,017
you came in too early
is what he's saying.

00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:53,752
It's one of these deals
that I'm tempted,

00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:55,687
but it's too small.

00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:58,157
It just --
but the -- but that's
the idea, is we --

00:25:58,157 --> 00:26:00,059
you know, where is the world
domination of the mall?

00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,193
[ laughter ]

00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:02,461
Let's not limit it
to malls.

00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:03,862
We can take these anywhere.
That's why we need you.

00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:06,765
You know,
I think -- I get it.

00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:08,734
It's interesting.
It's small.

00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:10,903
The train is small.
The deal is small.

00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,337
The returns are small.

00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:15,507
I like to think big.

00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:17,209
Well,
let's think big together.
Big, big, big, big, big, big.

00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:18,444
This train can grow.
100 locations.

00:26:18,444 --> 00:26:20,779
Basically, if we did absolutely
nothing all next year,

00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:23,315
that's $150,000 net profit
that's passive income,

00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:24,650
Mr. wonderful.

00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,685
You love
to invest in stocks.
No, look, I like it.

00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:27,753
Think of it that way.

00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,088
There's a little concern
about economies

00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:31,490
in different regions,
but the model basically works.

00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,659
It's not bad.
It's just small.

00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:36,929
HERJAVEC: Here's the great
thing about your business.

00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:40,032
You're making a pretty steady
stream of income.

00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:42,468
I think this is a great
business for you guys,

00:26:42,468 --> 00:26:44,203
but it's too small
for an investor.

00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:45,137
I'm out.

00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:50,075
Guys, look,
I'm very tempted

00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:51,944
because back-of-my-envelope
calculations,

00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,979
you're making about 20% return
on the capital.

00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:57,082
Probably 25%, 30%.

00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:59,118
Give us one
of your crazy proposals.

00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:01,553
It's just too small.
It's just too small.

00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:02,955
It's just too small.
I'm --

00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,756
there's small,
and small grows to big.

00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:07,159
You started out small, too,
and look where you're at today.

00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:08,794
What are you gonna do?

00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:09,995
I'm suffering,
I'm suffering!
CUBAN:
You're killing me, smalls!

00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:12,431
I'm suffering
listening to you!

00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:16,969
Okay, okay, look, guys, it's too
small for Mr. Wonderful.

00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:17,870
I'm out.

00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:21,240
Thank you
for your consideration.

00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,575
Oh, my gosh, that train
finally left the station.

00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:24,943
[ laughing ] Yeah.
[ laughs ]

00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:28,447
I'm thinking about this
'cause I like what you're doing

00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:30,315
in that you're bringing
something to the malls

00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,817
that's different.

00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:35,587
You're kind of bringing back
something that's fun for kids,

00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:37,523
and parents can do it
with them.

00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:40,159
It's like a feel-good,
nice kind of business...

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,226
And it is, Lori.
...To have.

00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:42,394
Thank you
for saying because --

00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:43,795
not -- go ahead.

00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:46,465
Well, you know, when Stan first
approached me about this

00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:49,067
and said, "well, Kev, we're
gonna drive choo-choo trains

00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:50,769
in the mall"...
[ Herjavec laughs ]

00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:53,705
...I was a little apprehensive
to say the least.

00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:54,873
[ laughs ]

00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:56,308
But then once
I went to the mall...

00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:58,143
You have to see it
in person to appreciate it.

00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:00,145
...And saw it in person,
it's exactly what you said.

00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:03,081
There was just such a level
of joy associated with it,

00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:05,551
and we were going through
a pretty rough time.

00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:08,754
Um...
I just think, you know,

00:28:08,754 --> 00:28:13,458
it would be so wonderful to get
one of you guys behind us.

00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:19,198
May I say one thing?

00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:22,568
We are willing to do
100% return.

00:28:22,568 --> 00:28:26,104
Every dollar that we make
from the sale of tickets,

00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:28,307
every dollar would go towards
paying that debt in full.

00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:31,143
Then thereafter,
you would get 20%.

00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:38,083
That's interesting to me.

00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:40,085
So, here's my offer.

00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:42,254
I'm gonna offer you half,

00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:44,156
but I'm gonna need
another shark in with me.

00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:45,023
Okay.

00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:50,195
I'd like Mr. Wonderful,
my buddy here,

00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:52,497
because of connections,
and he fits.

00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:05,110
[ sighs ] You're wrestling
with this, man.

00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,546
Yeah, I am 'cause it's
actually not a bad business.

00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:11,683
All right, Stan and Kev,
the offer is this.

00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:14,786
You get $125,000,
you have two sharks,

00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:17,222
and we are going to get 20%
of the whole business,

00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:18,824
and we'll grow this together
with you.

00:29:18,824 --> 00:29:20,359
There are some metrics
I want to work on,

00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:21,526
I want to tweak with you.

00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:23,295
We can make more money
than you're making.

00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:25,831
What do you say, guys?

00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:30,135
Absolutely,
we would be honored.

00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:31,770
We would love to do business
with both of you.

00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,572
And we want a dining car.
Yes.

00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:35,307
All right.
And you will get
your dining car.

00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:36,942
[ laughter ]
Thank you.

00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:38,310
Fantastic.
Thank you all
for your attention.

00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,544
It's a good thing
to be doing.

00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:40,512
Beautiful presentation.

00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:41,780
ULLERY: We will not
let you down.

00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,248
All right,
let's sell some tickets.

00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:44,616
Congrats, guys.
We're gonna sell lots
of tickets, guys.

00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,018
Thank you so much.
Thank you all
for your audience.

00:29:46,018 --> 00:29:47,886
Congratulations.

00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:49,655
You bo-bos did
all that thinking,

00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:51,323
and you didn't even
negotiate.

00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:52,557
No, don't worry.

00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:53,892
'cause we're getting
our money back.

00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:56,762
[ train horn honking ]
[ laughs ]

00:29:56,762 --> 00:29:58,864
[ bell ringing ]

00:29:58,864 --> 00:30:00,299
[ laughing ] Yes!

00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,366
We're excited, America.

00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:02,901
We're gonna bring
a trackless train

00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:04,002
in every mall in America.

00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:17,115
NARRATOR: Next into the tank
is a firefighter

00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:19,584
with an invention
to prevent costly damage

00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:20,919
for homes and business.

00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:31,496
Sharks, I'm Matt Scarpuzzi,

00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,666
and my company is Quickstop
fire sprinkler tools.

00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:39,371
I'm seeking $150,000 in exchange
for 10% equity in my company.

00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:40,572
What would you do

00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:43,275
if the fire sprinklers
above your head right now

00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:44,509
started to pour out

00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,279
an entire bathtub of water
every other minute?

00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,613
Now, fire sprinklers

00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:52,184
are the best way to save lives
and protect property.

00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:55,153
The bad news is, every year
in the United States,

00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:57,723
accidental activations
of these sprinkler heads

00:30:57,723 --> 00:30:59,891
cause billions of dollars
in water damage.

00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,026
I'm gonna show you

00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:03,128
what an activated sprinkler head
looks like.

00:31:03,128 --> 00:31:05,597
I want you to imagine this water

00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:09,201
pouring out inside your home
or your business.

00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:12,871
What you need is a Quickstop
fire sprinkler tool.

00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:19,745
With the Quickstop, you're not
just getting an incredible tool.

00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:21,546
You're getting
an insurance policy

00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,582
that protects
your greatest investments

00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:24,983
from expensive water damage.

00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:26,952
Sharks, I need your help

00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:29,755
to keep that water in the ocean
with you where it belongs

00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:31,823
and not in our homes
and our businesses.

00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:33,125
Can we see one?

00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:34,726
Absolutely. I have samples
that I'll bring to you.

00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,796
And these are
on sprinkler heads,

00:31:37,796 --> 00:31:39,531
so you can actually
use them yourself.

00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:40,365
Thank you, Matt.

00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:41,933
So, this is something

00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:45,070
that you normally carry around
as a fireman?

00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:49,174
These are on every truck
in the city that I work for,

00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:51,810
and, yes, this is a tool
that we use to shut off...

00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:54,513
Thanks, Matt.
...Fire sprinkler heads
when we're called to scene.

00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:55,814
HERJAVEC: Matt?
Yes?

00:31:55,814 --> 00:31:57,382
Walk me
through the premise.

00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:58,650
The fire alarm goes off.

00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,285
The sprinkler system
goes off.

00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:02,854
So then we know
it's a false alarm.

00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:03,922
Mm-hmm.

00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,525
Is the premise
that the building guy

00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:08,827
would then go to every sprinkler
and turn it off?

00:32:08,827 --> 00:32:10,962
That's one of the myths
about fire sprinklers

00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:13,064
is that every sprinkler head
goes off.

00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:16,535
Only the head that is nearest
to the heat source or the fire

00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:19,371
or the one that gets
accidentally hit goes off.

00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:20,405
Really?
So, 90 --

00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:21,573
I didn't know that.

00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:24,075
Yeah, 90% of the time,
if there is a fire,

00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:25,677
one sprinkler head goes off,

00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:28,380
and most of the time
when they're accidentally hit,

00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,381
it's usually one.

00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:30,515
Can't the building

00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:32,017
just turn the water source off
to that part?

00:32:32,017 --> 00:32:33,385
[ chuckles ]
If it was only that easy.

00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:36,521
I've been on calls where
it has taken over 45 minutes

00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:39,391
for the building engineer
to find the shutoff.

00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:40,792
GREINER: Yes,
I've experienced that.

00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,327
That is hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:44,429
So, Matt,
you're gonna have to educate

00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:47,432
every single potential buyer
about the merits of this tool.

00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:50,702
That is a form
of hell on Earth.

00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:54,306
Unless it happens to you,
which I had it happen to me,

00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,608
and black, sludgy water
comes out.

00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:58,009
It's not clear water.

00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:00,011
And then when that water
comes out,

00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:03,014
it stains and ruins everything,
and it floods out,

00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:05,083
so it went down floor
after floor after floor,

00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,918
flooding all the floors
all the way down.

00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:09,821
I've literally seen one
sprinkler head on the 32nd floor

00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,156
of a high-rise.

00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:14,125
By the time we got there,
which we were eight blocks away,

00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:16,361
it was down
to the parking garage.

00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:19,231
So, is your premise that
individuals would buy this,

00:33:19,231 --> 00:33:21,233
or will building managers
buy it?

00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:22,934
I mean, who are you
gonna sell this to?

00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:25,337
Our goal is to sell it
to the 33,000 fire departments

00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:26,705
that are in the United States.

00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:27,739
But don't
the fire departments

00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:28,807
already have a tool
like this?

00:33:28,807 --> 00:33:30,075
No, they don't.

00:33:30,075 --> 00:33:30,942
They don't?
They don't?

00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:32,077
I'm not kidding you.

00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:34,179
Before I invented this tool,
I would show up,

00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:35,881
and I would feel
utterly useless.

00:33:35,881 --> 00:33:37,816
So you have no tool
to turn it off?

00:33:37,816 --> 00:33:39,718
We would take
wooden door chalks,

00:33:39,718 --> 00:33:41,219
and we would hammer them
together...

00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:42,654
Really?
...Inside of the opening.

00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:44,256
Tell us about the economics
then, right?

00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:45,257
What do they cost to make?

00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:46,758
What are you gonna
sell them for?

00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:50,028
We have sold almost $18,000
in the last six weeks.

00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:54,332
Those cost about $25 each
to manufacture.

00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:55,734
What do you sell them for?

00:33:55,734 --> 00:33:56,868
They sell for $89.95.

00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,036
Who were you selling to?

00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,838
Who did you find
was your customer?

00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:01,373
We have sold fire departments,

00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,975
h.o.a.s, building construction
workers, hospitals.

00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:07,879
I like products that get sold
into a very narrow market...

00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,115
Mm-hmm.
...Because it's easy
to capture,

00:34:10,115 --> 00:34:12,284
but I'm trying
to get my head around,

00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:15,086
are the departments gonna buy
one for every fireman

00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:16,855
or just put one
on the truck?

00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:18,223
'cause if it's one
on every truck,

00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,591
it's not that big a market.

00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:23,328
Most of what we're selling to
is one on every engine.

00:34:23,328 --> 00:34:25,730
However, the fire department
is one little sliver.

00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,500
The market that we're selling to
is the people who go in

00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,169
and install these systems
because they knock them off.

00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:32,804
Oh, I see.
Homeowners who have had one
go off above them

00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:34,940
because they've suffered the
pain of the water coming down.

00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,441
Is there a patent on it?

00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:39,611
This has a utility patent
that was filed back in may,

00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:41,446
and we're still waiting
to hear back from that.

00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,715
And what are you gonna do
with the $150,000?

00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:46,151
I need to buy more parts.
We have a couple orders

00:34:46,151 --> 00:34:48,853
that are possibly coming forward
in the thousands,

00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:51,523
and I don't have that inventory
on hand right now.

00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:54,059
Basically, anybody that has
a fire sprinkler system

00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:55,961
should have this tool
in their home,

00:34:55,961 --> 00:34:58,496
but getting to them is
a whole different problem.

00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:00,031
That brings up a great point,
and that's --

00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:01,166
no kidding.

00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:02,000
SCARPUZZI: I actually have
a second product.

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,234
Ah!
Oh.

00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:06,771
And this is our home
fire sprinkler kit.

00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,807
It is designed
for the homeowner.

00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:10,609
It is actually a two-piece tool,

00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,477
and it not only stops
fire sprinklers,

00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:14,913
but it stops other plumbing
leaks around your house.

00:35:14,913 --> 00:35:15,981
How does it work?

00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:17,716
There is a disposable cartridge

00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:19,384
that gets loaded into the handle
of the gun.

00:35:19,384 --> 00:35:21,353
This is designed to fit
sprinkler heads,

00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:22,587
as well as other plumbing.

00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:26,625
So, if you have a sink
like I have here

00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,360
and you have a hose break...

00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,395
GREINER:
What about a pipe break?

00:35:30,395 --> 00:35:32,297
So, you have this hose that's --

00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:35,367
that's pouring water out
or a pipe, a faucet, a tap

00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:39,571
between 5/16 and an inch, this
gets inserted into the leak.

00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:42,641
Goes up inside, and, basically,

00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,776
you push the handle
of the tool forward,

00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:45,944
which expands the balloon

00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:47,545
and locks the cartridge
in place.

00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:48,913
But that -- that has existed

00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:50,749
for quite some time
where I'm from.

00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:52,784
What, that tool?
Yeah, where I'm from.

00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:54,419
We would -- we would fold
the holes in half

00:35:54,419 --> 00:35:55,654
and put a cinder block
on it.

00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:57,789
[ laughs ]
And that's it.
No more leak.

00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:00,592
So, let's get back to
the sprinkler head over here.

00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:05,930
The challenge with this
is really educational.

00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,332
I wouldn't even know
where to start with this.

00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:08,733
That's the challenge.
Yeah.

00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,268
CUBAN:
That's not a challenge.

00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:11,603
JOHN: Really?
O'LEARY: Okay,
what's the solution, Mark?

00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:12,871
Wait, but it's a challenge
for me.

00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:13,872
You're gonna go door to door
and sell them to each home?

00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:15,140
No.
But I think this is --

00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,142
"hi. I'm Mark Cuban.
I've solved your problem."

00:36:17,142 --> 00:36:18,777
hey, I used to go door to door
selling when I was a kid.

00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:19,911
I could.
You're gonna start again?

00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:22,347
Yeah, why not?
I have absolutely no knowledge

00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,749
in how
I can help you with this.

00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:27,719
You've come up with an ingenious
product, but I'm out.

00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:29,287
Thank you.
Appreciate it.

00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:31,489
Lori, if there was ever
a QVC product...

00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:33,324
[ laughs ]
...This has to be it.

00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:35,360
Here's my feeling.

00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,796
You risk your lives
every day to save us,

00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:40,532
and now you're doing something
really admirable

00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:42,367
in that you're trying
to create a product

00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,802
that stops damage
in our homes.

00:36:43,802 --> 00:36:46,237
And because I think
this is something needed

00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:48,740
and really good,
I'm gonna make you an offer.

00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,543
But I think there's
a lot of risk in it,

00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,645
so I'm gonna need
another shark in with me.

00:36:53,645 --> 00:36:58,083
So, I'm gonna offer you half,
$75,000.

00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:01,753
But I'm gonna want 18%.

00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:04,155
So they would get 18%,
as well,

00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:06,391
so it would be 36% total.

00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:10,729
And I think this should be
a consumer product, as well.

00:37:12,864 --> 00:37:14,766
But we need to get
one other shark in.

00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:28,613
NARRATOR:
One shark is out.

00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:30,315
Lori has made a partial offer

00:37:30,315 --> 00:37:32,751
but wants another shark
in on the deal.

00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:36,121
So, I'm gonna offer you half,
$75,000.

00:37:36,121 --> 00:37:39,724
But I'm gonna want 18%.

00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:42,160
So they would get 18%,
as well,

00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,329
so it would be 36% total.

00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:48,133
All right, Matt, so, I think
it's a very clever design,

00:37:48,133 --> 00:37:49,801
but I disagree with Lori.

00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:52,103
I don't see it as
a large consumer product.

00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,505
I think you will definitely

00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:55,406
sell one
to every fire department,

00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:57,108
but until you came
out here today,

00:37:57,108 --> 00:38:00,044
I didn't realize that you
get false alarms with them.

00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:03,782
So I don't see a self-evident
consumer market.

00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:07,385
The training challenge is
tremendous to educate people.

00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:08,386
I'm out.

00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:10,855
Thank you.
Appreciate it.

00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:13,658
GREINER:
I'm going to clarify.

00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:17,128
For me to be invested,
it's the whole kit and caboodle.

00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,464
It's this
for the sprinkler heads.

00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:22,467
It's that for leaking pipes.
It's everything.

00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:23,468
It's everything.
It's everything.

00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:24,435
Yes.
And --

00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:25,870
and it's actually
one more thing.

00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,205
Oh, great, bring it on.

00:38:27,205 --> 00:38:28,873
So, wait, there's more.

00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:31,009
Firefighters climb ladders
all day long.

00:38:31,009 --> 00:38:32,277
The average person doesn't,

00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:34,445
and in order to get up
to the sprinkler head,

00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:37,048
how do they get up there
without climbing a ladder?

00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:38,616
So, what I did...

00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:42,487
Was, I designed a pole,
and the pole actually gets...

00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:43,555
[ laughter ]

00:38:43,555 --> 00:38:45,857
...The Quickstop talon
into the pole.

00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:48,560
It telescopes out over 12 feet,

00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,662
and anybody like a homeowner
or a maintenance worker

00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:51,629
can operate.

00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:53,498
That, I think, is brilliant

00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:54,799
because you get it
[snaps fingers] fast.

00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:56,067
When do you have time
to work?

00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:57,435
[ laughs ]
My brain --

00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:58,570
You're designing things
all day.
I like your mind.

00:38:58,570 --> 00:38:59,838
My brain is always moving.

00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:02,040
O'LEARY: Let me declare
my position on this.

00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,509
Because, you know, I see
the merits of the product,

00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,344
but I do not see the path
to market.

00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,213
I think
it's a very challenging one.

00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:10,348
The only way
I would do the deal

00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,051
and be the other $75,000
in Lori's scenario

00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:14,185
is if I get 25%.

00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:17,455
She can stay at 18%,
but I think the challenge...

00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:19,824
[ laughs ]
...Is really horrific.

00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:21,159
That's one hell of a fire
you're gonna have to put out.

00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:24,762
I would encourage Lori
to go to 25%,

00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:26,664
and the partnership
would get 50%...

00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:28,700
Oh, Lord.
...Which is what
I think it deserves.

00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,568
I don't care what Mr. Cuban
says about this.

00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:32,670
I think the challenge here
is brutal,

00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,838
and if you want to step in

00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:35,540
and take my $75,000
at a different price,

00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,608
go ahead and do it.

00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:39,677
But I want 25% because
this is not a company.

00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:40,879
It's a product.

00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,214
I do appreciate that offer,

00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,349
and I agree with part
of what you're saying,

00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:45,750
but I do own a company,

00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,553
and we are starting to establish
lines of distribution.

00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,288
Matt,
let me ask a question.

00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:52,423
Why not, given
the value proposition

00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:55,026
that you've discussed
and the hundreds of thousands,

00:39:55,026 --> 00:39:57,362
if not millions, of dollars
that can be saved,

00:39:57,362 --> 00:39:58,463
why $89?

00:39:58,463 --> 00:40:01,532
Why not $299?
Why not $499?

00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:03,268
That's a great question.

00:40:03,268 --> 00:40:05,303
As a new product,
I put that $89.95 out there

00:40:05,303 --> 00:40:07,805
to get a feel for the market,
and you're absolutely right.

00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:10,441
We have not had anybody
kick at our price.

00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:11,843
People are paying $200

00:40:11,843 --> 00:40:13,544
for a sprinkler tool that
can't do what mine does.

00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:15,980
Right, so why aren't you
charging $299?

00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,182
'cause it solves
all your problems.

00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:20,151
Because I'm a fireman
and I design tools

00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:21,452
and that's what I'm good at.

00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:23,021
Therein lies the problem.
And I'm learning this.

00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:24,222
JOHN: That's the operator
problem we're talking about.

00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:25,390
SCARPUZZI: And I'm learning
this new thing.

00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,025
O'LEARY: That's why
I want to be commensurate

00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:28,159
with the risk inherent here.
the problem is,
you don't have a company.

00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,460
You're an inventor.

00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,130
And you have a full-time job
and a full-time obligation,

00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:35,266
and so whoever the partner is,
if you get a partner,

00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,834
is gonna be responsible
for that other side.

00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:38,036
So my point is,

00:40:38,036 --> 00:40:41,005
I'm not looking to have
to insert that much manpower

00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:42,607
to help develop a company.

00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,876
So my ask
is not unreasonable.
You can decide on that,

00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:47,211
but to answer the question,
I'm out.

00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:48,212
Thank you.

00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:49,380
HERJAVEC: Mark's out.
Damon's out.

00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:54,085
Kevin made you an offer --
$75,000 for 25%.

00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:55,520
If Lori goes in with him,

00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,024
you're giving up 50% of your
business to get your $150,000.

00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:01,659
You got to make
a decision here.

00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:04,729
Well, Lori, she hasn't clarified
where she stands. She dropped --

00:41:04,729 --> 00:41:05,863
yeah, Lori,
are you in on that?

00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:08,633
I would like you, Kevin,
to go in with me...

00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:09,667
O'LEARY: Right.

00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:10,702
...Because
this is good product.

00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:12,236
Would you go 40%?
No.

00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:15,139
20%/20%?
No,
it's a partnership 50/50.

00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,240
Half the work is here.

00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,508
That's the way
I look at it.

00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:19,277
The immense amount of work
it's gonna take

00:41:19,277 --> 00:41:20,845
to actually bring this
to market,

00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:22,447
it's weighing
on my shoulders now.

00:41:22,447 --> 00:41:26,017
Lori, Kevin's firm --
$75,000 for 25%.

00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:27,418
What are you --
what are you doing?
Are you in on that deal?

00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:34,459
Yes, but it doesn't sound
like he's in on that.

00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:35,660
All right.
We don't know,

00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,261
so the offer
on the table right now

00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:39,430
to clarify it,
you get two sharks.

00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:40,465
Each of them want 25%

00:41:40,465 --> 00:41:42,166
because of the weight of work
ahead of us.

00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:51,809
I-I do understand the deal.

00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:54,879
I thank you, and I cannot do 50%
of my business at this time.

00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:56,781
CUBAN: Thank you.
Thank you.

00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:58,282
Great idea.
Thank you.

00:41:58,282 --> 00:41:59,817
Sorry, it's a great idea.
You're gonna be fine,
Matt.

00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:00,885
And I really wish you
good luck.

00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:02,253
Thanks for your time.
I appreciate it.

00:42:06,224 --> 00:42:07,792
CUBAN:
It's a good product.

00:42:07,792 --> 00:42:10,094
I think it's an important
and good product,

00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:12,196
but I know what we would have
to put into it.

00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,599
If he raises the price
to $200 or more,

00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:16,401
he'll sell a million dollars
worth of product.

00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:17,802
HERJAVEC: I agree.

00:42:17,802 --> 00:42:20,271
I understand there's a lot
of work that needs to be done

00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:22,840
moving forward,
but I anticipate doing that,

00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,343
and I will take help,
but I just couldn't do 50%.

00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:27,612
It's just too much.
