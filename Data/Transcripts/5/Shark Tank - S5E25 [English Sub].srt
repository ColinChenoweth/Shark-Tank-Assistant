00:00:00,375 --> 00:00:02,255
NARRATOR:
This is the shark tank,

00:00:02,255 --> 00:00:03,845
where hopeful entrepreneurs

00:00:03,845 --> 00:00:06,646
get a once-in-a-lifetime chance
to pitch the sharks

00:00:06,646 --> 00:00:08,571
in hopes
of getting an investment

00:00:08,571 --> 00:00:11,489
to start, grow,
or save their businesses.

00:00:11,489 --> 00:00:12,745
How about I hand out
some wine?

00:00:12,745 --> 00:00:14,080
Absolutely. Great idea.

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,748
NARRATOR: The entrepreneurs
must convince a shark

00:00:15,748 --> 00:00:18,618
to invest the full amount
they're asking for,

00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:20,286
or they'll walk away
with nothing.

00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:21,888
How much
is each light bulb?

00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:22,788
$289.

00:00:22,788 --> 00:00:24,090
Wow.
That sucks.

00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,125
Somebody else can do it,
but we're gonna do it better.

00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:28,493
It's a huge --
but you got to tell me how
you're gonna do it better.

00:00:28,493 --> 00:00:29,661
No one comes in here
and says,

00:00:29,661 --> 00:00:31,162
"You know what, Mark?
I'm gonna do it worse."

00:00:31,162 --> 00:00:33,632
Your answers to the questions
are driving me nuts.

00:00:33,632 --> 00:00:36,735
We're a venture capital
firm on steroids. There's
nobody like us.

00:00:36,735 --> 00:00:38,637
NARRATOR:
If the sharks hear a great idea,

00:00:38,637 --> 00:00:42,607
they're ready to invest
using their own money.

00:00:42,607 --> 00:00:45,843
250k, but I need
30% of the business.

00:00:45,843 --> 00:00:47,878
I'll make you
a lot richer faster.

00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:49,547
NARRATOR: And they're willing
to fight each other

00:00:49,547 --> 00:00:51,248
for a piece of the action.

00:00:51,248 --> 00:00:52,349
I'll give you
the $350,000.

00:00:52,349 --> 00:00:54,084
I think Robert is being
a little bit greedy.

00:00:54,084 --> 00:00:56,587
Kevin's offer
is ridiculous.
My offer is great.

00:00:56,587 --> 00:00:58,355
Mark is simply tagging along
on my offer.

00:00:58,355 --> 00:01:00,124
Oh, that wasn't a real offer,
Robert, and you know it.

00:01:00,124 --> 00:01:02,826
It's a little bit of
a feeding frenzy in the tank.

00:01:05,395 --> 00:01:06,796
NARRATOR:
Who are the sharks?

00:01:08,231 --> 00:01:11,034
They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors

00:01:11,034 --> 00:01:13,536
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.

00:01:13,536 --> 00:01:16,205
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist

00:01:16,205 --> 00:01:18,608
who turned a $10,000 loan

00:01:18,608 --> 00:01:23,211
into a software business
worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:23,946 --> 00:01:26,782
Barbara Corcoran went
from waiting tables in Manhattan

00:01:26,782 --> 00:01:30,385
to building the city's
preeminent real-estate empire.

00:01:31,787 --> 00:01:35,023
Robert Herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,

00:01:35,023 --> 00:01:36,425
is now a technology mogul

00:01:36,425 --> 00:01:41,629
who sold his first internet
companies for over $350 million.

00:01:42,496 --> 00:01:44,865
Lori Greiner, the queen of QVC,

00:01:44,865 --> 00:01:48,936
holds over 100 patents and
has launched over 300 products,

00:01:48,936 --> 00:01:52,707
grossing over a half a billion
dollars in retail sales.

00:01:52,707 --> 00:01:54,475
And Mark Cuban,

00:01:54,475 --> 00:01:57,611
notorious billionaire
entrepreneur, tech guru,

00:01:57,611 --> 00:02:00,013
and the outspoken owner
of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.

00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:13,960
First into the tank
are entrepreneurs

00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,495
with smart light bulbs
for a new generation.

00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:27,373
Hello, sharks.
My name is Corey Egan.

00:02:27,373 --> 00:02:28,974
And my name
is Swapnil Bora.

00:02:28,974 --> 00:02:30,309
We're from Dallas, Texas,

00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:32,211
and our company
is ilumi solutions.

00:02:32,211 --> 00:02:36,047
We're here to show you
the future of lighting.

00:02:36,047 --> 00:02:39,851
We are seeking $350,000
of investment

00:02:39,851 --> 00:02:43,821
in exchange for 15% ownership
in our company.

00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,458
Ilumi is a series

00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:51,228
of intelligent
and tunable L.E.D. light bulbs

00:02:51,228 --> 00:02:54,197
you control wirelessly
right from a mobile device.

00:02:54,197 --> 00:02:56,133
It's very simple.

00:02:56,133 --> 00:02:59,903
Screw in any number of ilumi,
download the app,

00:02:59,903 --> 00:03:03,140
and you get complete control
over your lighting.

00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,476
It's about having the right
light at the right time.

00:03:06,476 --> 00:03:08,045
So, Barbara,
you're an early riser.

00:03:08,045 --> 00:03:09,145
CORCORAN: Yes, I am.

00:03:09,145 --> 00:03:11,947
Imagine waking up
feeling refreshed and alert

00:03:11,947 --> 00:03:15,618
with a simulated sunrise that
slowly eases you out of bed.

00:03:15,618 --> 00:03:17,119
Hmm.

00:03:17,119 --> 00:03:18,954
Robert, got a busy day
ahead of you.

00:03:18,954 --> 00:03:20,890
Every day.
You got your phone, your keys,
your wallet.

00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,358
You head outside,

00:03:22,358 --> 00:03:24,026
and your lights automatically
turn off behind you.

00:03:24,026 --> 00:03:25,661
And when you return,

00:03:25,661 --> 00:03:28,730
your lights greet you,
welcoming you home.

00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:33,168
Kevin, connect your ilumi
to your stock portfolio

00:03:33,168 --> 00:03:35,470
so you can know
if you're in the red...

00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,539
[ laughter ]
...Or the green.

00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:38,707
It's always red.

00:03:39,908 --> 00:03:43,478
Lori, set the perfect romantic
candlelit atmosphere

00:03:43,478 --> 00:03:44,846
and relax
with the husband.

00:03:44,846 --> 00:03:47,047
CORCORAN: Ooh.

00:03:47,047 --> 00:03:51,185
And, Mark, represent
your team and ours

00:03:51,185 --> 00:03:54,988
by lighting it up blue and green
on game day.

00:03:54,988 --> 00:03:57,057
Go, Mavericks. Yeah.
Yes. Go, Mavs.

00:03:57,057 --> 00:03:59,560
And after the Mavericks win,
of course,

00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,161
let the celebration begin.

00:04:01,161 --> 00:04:02,362
[ dance music plays ]

00:04:02,362 --> 00:04:02,787
GREINER: [ laughs ]

00:04:02,787 --> 00:04:05,590
Whoo!
Ahh. Pretty cool.

00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,758
[ music stops ]

00:04:06,758 --> 00:04:09,227
Very cute.
Corey,
how does it work?

00:04:09,227 --> 00:04:10,928
Do I plug something
into my outlet

00:04:10,928 --> 00:04:12,997
and that controls
all the lights?

00:04:12,997 --> 00:04:14,365
It is
the light themselves.

00:04:14,365 --> 00:04:15,867
So, we have
two sizes of light,

00:04:15,867 --> 00:04:17,001
and all you need are
the bulbs and the app.

00:04:17,001 --> 00:04:18,436
So you just --
and you can put the bulb

00:04:18,436 --> 00:04:21,605
into any light fixture
that you have.
any light fixture.

00:04:21,605 --> 00:04:23,240
So, we've got --
so, you're using Wi-Fi
in a house then?

00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,208
It's actually
bluetooth-based.
Bluetooth.

00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,444
So, where are you at with this
in the market?

00:04:27,444 --> 00:04:29,579
So, we're at the final stages
of development.

00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:31,448
Swapnil and I were
actually classmates

00:04:31,448 --> 00:04:34,451
at U.T. Dallas
where we came up with the idea.

00:04:34,451 --> 00:04:37,254
We're now right at the doorstep
to manufacturing,

00:04:37,254 --> 00:04:38,988
which is why, really,
we're here today.

00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:40,923
How much
is each light bulb?

00:04:40,923 --> 00:04:44,427
$289 for a three-pack.

00:04:44,427 --> 00:04:46,495
Whoa.
CORCORAN: Wow.
It's $90 a light bulb.

00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:47,963
Correct.
Wow.

00:04:47,963 --> 00:04:51,767
How long does it last compared
to a normal light bulb?

00:04:51,767 --> 00:04:53,669
It lasts
up to 20 years.

00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:55,504
From the consumer point
of view,

00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:58,673
making that decision
between a $100 bulb

00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:02,710
and one for $2.80
is gonna be a very tough call.

00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,879
What we've seen is
that both consumers

00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,381
as well as commercial folks

00:05:06,381 --> 00:05:08,416
when they're looking to get
the most from their space,

00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:09,684
ilumi is actually

00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,720
an easier and more
cost-effective solution.

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,255
You're not selling
light bulbs.

00:05:14,255 --> 00:05:15,255
You're selling
a lighting system.

00:05:15,255 --> 00:05:17,224
Exactly.
Correct.

00:05:17,224 --> 00:05:19,593
So tell me how many steps it
takes to get the system working.

00:05:19,593 --> 00:05:21,161
It takes
essentially two steps.

00:05:21,161 --> 00:05:22,463
Screw in the light bulb.
Got it.

00:05:22,463 --> 00:05:25,132
Download the app. Go straight
to the setup process.

00:05:25,132 --> 00:05:27,501
From that, the bulb finds
the app...

00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:28,702
Can I see the app?
Sure.

00:05:28,702 --> 00:05:29,870
...Connects,
and that's it.

00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,271
I have to ask
the magic question.

00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:34,507
Do you have a patent pending
on this or a patent on this?

00:05:34,507 --> 00:05:36,109
Great question.
We have filed U.S.

00:05:36,109 --> 00:05:39,545
And one international
utility patents pending.

00:05:39,545 --> 00:05:40,680
O'LEARY:
Tell me if I'm wrong,

00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,081
but I'm sort of focusing

00:05:42,081 --> 00:05:43,916
on what matters in this deal.

00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,284
If your I.P. clears,

00:05:45,284 --> 00:05:47,053
if your intellectual property
clears,

00:05:47,053 --> 00:05:48,387
you don't really want to be

00:05:48,387 --> 00:05:50,156
in the light bulb-building
business

00:05:50,156 --> 00:05:52,190
and distribution
and logistics business.

00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,992
Or do you?
This is our answer.

00:05:53,992 --> 00:05:56,027
So, we know that the value
in this company

00:05:56,027 --> 00:05:59,030
will come from, one,
building a great company

00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,333
that we are manufacturing
and shipping bulbs.

00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,101
Wow.

00:06:03,101 --> 00:06:04,669
There's so many players
in the light business

00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:05,837
that have
massive market share.

00:06:05,837 --> 00:06:07,873
If I -- if there was ever

00:06:07,873 --> 00:06:10,406
a licensing deal
in the shark tank, you're it.

00:06:10,406 --> 00:06:11,874
But you're telling me,

00:06:11,874 --> 00:06:13,842
"I can't wait to build
my light-bulb factory."

00:06:13,842 --> 00:06:14,877
That sucks.

00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:18,814
CUBAN: When are you gonna have
your samples,

00:06:18,814 --> 00:06:20,916
and when will you
be able to ship?

00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,985
So, our goal is to ship
by the end of this year.

00:06:22,985 --> 00:06:25,821
So we're ready to start
the tooling process right now.

00:06:25,821 --> 00:06:27,221
That's one of the reasons
we're here

00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:28,589
and we're asking
for the $350,000.

00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:31,759
Your money gets our product
into customers' hands.

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,394
I just want to clear
the field.
Sure.

00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:35,063
I'm -- I hate to tell you,
I'm a disbeliever here.

00:06:35,063 --> 00:06:38,966
Turning on my lights
with my iPad

00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:40,401
for me just seems weird.

00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:44,639
And $99 for a light bulb
versus 3 bucks

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,673
is a heck of a hard sell.

00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:49,409
Sure.
It just doesn't strike me
as a realistic amount.

00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,012
Well, I appreciate
your consideration, Barbara.

00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:53,580
Pleasure.

00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,017
I'm concerned with some
of your competition out there

00:06:57,017 --> 00:07:00,987
because I know
you do have competition.

00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:02,756
And I'm not sure --

00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,991
I think I love this
for the consumer market.

00:07:05,991 --> 00:07:07,927
But I'm not sure
where you're gonna fall

00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,096
when you finish everything
if you get the I.p.

00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,265
If you don't, then I'm afraid

00:07:13,265 --> 00:07:15,901
that you're not going to be able
to be competitive.

00:07:15,901 --> 00:07:17,403
So, for that reason, I'm out.

00:07:21,673 --> 00:07:24,909
Where I see
a real opportunity

00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:27,479
is in the lighting market

00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:30,115
that is very complicated
and very high-end.

00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:32,550
Yes.

00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,986
In that market,
your $100 light bulb is cheap.

00:07:34,986 --> 00:07:35,787
Exactly. Exactly.
Exactly.

00:07:35,787 --> 00:07:36,888
HERJAVEC: Okay.

00:07:36,888 --> 00:07:38,156
All right.
Let me start with an offer.

00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,726
I'll give you
the $350,000

00:07:42,726 --> 00:07:45,896
for 35%.

00:07:47,264 --> 00:07:50,134
Well, first of all, I really
appreciate the offer, Robert.

00:07:50,134 --> 00:07:52,236
So, you know, thank you,

00:07:52,236 --> 00:07:54,204
and I'm excited that you're
interested in ilumi.

00:07:54,204 --> 00:07:56,140
I would like to,
if it's okay,

00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,774
be open to other offers,
as well.

00:08:01,344 --> 00:08:04,313
All right, guys.
I'll make it easy. Look.

00:08:04,313 --> 00:08:06,682
I think Robert is being
a little bit greedy,

00:08:06,682 --> 00:08:08,618
but I'm not gonna be
totally ungreedy

00:08:08,618 --> 00:08:10,553
because I think I can bring
a lot of value.

00:08:10,553 --> 00:08:14,791
So, what I'll offer you
is the $350,000 for 25%.

00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:18,360
Mark, we really appreciate
your offer, as well.

00:08:19,561 --> 00:08:21,997
Wow, wow, wow, wow.
Ichi-wow-a.

00:08:21,997 --> 00:08:23,365
HERJAVEC: I know!
Oh, my God.

00:08:23,365 --> 00:08:24,733
You got to tell me
yes or no.

00:08:24,733 --> 00:08:26,201
If it --
if it's too much equity

00:08:26,201 --> 00:08:27,602
and that's what you feel,
and you have a --

00:08:27,602 --> 00:08:29,604
you have a limit
that you've set for yourselves,

00:08:29,604 --> 00:08:32,174
then let's not go
back and forth.
sure --

00:08:32,174 --> 00:08:34,408
just tell me the limit and if
you want to do a deal with me,
then we'll figure it out.

00:08:34,408 --> 00:08:38,012
Well, why don't you wait and see
if you have any other offers?

00:08:38,012 --> 00:08:39,313
EGAN: I-I would
appreciate that.

00:08:39,313 --> 00:08:41,081
If possible,
I'd also like to see

00:08:41,081 --> 00:08:42,483
if there's other folks
with more questions.

00:08:42,483 --> 00:08:44,285
You know, Corey,
I wouldn't --

00:08:44,285 --> 00:08:46,387
All right, guys.
I'm out.

00:08:55,028 --> 00:08:59,365
NARRATOR: Corey and Swapnil
had two offers on the table,

00:08:59,365 --> 00:09:01,968
but their indecision
has changed Mark's mind.

00:09:01,968 --> 00:09:04,003
If it's too much equity
and that's what you feel,
and you have a --

00:09:04,003 --> 00:09:06,673
you have a limit
that you've set for yourselves,

00:09:06,673 --> 00:09:08,842
then let's not go
back and forth.
sure --

00:09:08,842 --> 00:09:10,576
just tell me the limit and if
you want to do a deal with me,
then we'll figure it out.

00:09:10,576 --> 00:09:12,211
Well, why don't you wait and see
if you have any other offers?

00:09:12,211 --> 00:09:13,312
I-I would
appreciate that.

00:09:13,312 --> 00:09:14,580
If possible,
I'd also like to see

00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,981
if there's other folks
with more questions.

00:09:15,981 --> 00:09:17,783
You know, Corey,
I wouldn't --

00:09:17,783 --> 00:09:20,886
all right, guys.
I'm out.

00:09:20,886 --> 00:09:22,621
Doggone it. I was gonna warn you
on that one.

00:09:24,056 --> 00:09:26,158
EGAN: Mark, I --
you know, I-I know the
24-second shot clock.

00:09:26,158 --> 00:09:27,525
I didn't even get
the 24-second shot clock.

00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,060
CUBAN: Yeah, it's not even
about that, guys. Look.

00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,963
It was an opportunity to say,
"Look, Mark. Here's the number."

00:09:31,963 --> 00:09:34,432
Yeah.
and if you wanted to do
business with me,

00:09:34,432 --> 00:09:36,234
you would have given me
the number.

00:09:36,234 --> 00:09:37,802
Mark, if you could give us
a moment,

00:09:37,802 --> 00:09:38,970
we would love to take
the time.
fine, that's fine.
that's fine.

00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,705
Is that all right?
Okay. Fine, fine, fine.

00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,773
Okay. All right. Thank you.
O'LEARY: I'll -- I'll put
another offer on the table

00:09:42,773 --> 00:09:44,675
that doesn't involve
so much equity.

00:09:44,675 --> 00:09:46,710
My offer's much simpler.

00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,246
I'm not interested
in any equity at all.

00:09:49,246 --> 00:09:51,615
I'll give you $350,000

00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,817
upon the clearance
of your I.p.

00:09:53,817 --> 00:09:57,354
And one contingency --
that you allow me to license it

00:09:57,354 --> 00:10:00,090
to a very large
light-bulb manufacturer.

00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,491
I'm not interested
in funding

00:10:01,491 --> 00:10:03,959
growth in manufacturing
light bulbs.

00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:06,228
I want 15%
of the royalty stream.

00:10:06,228 --> 00:10:07,963
You keep the whole company.

00:10:07,963 --> 00:10:11,033
I'll make you a lot richer
faster with my strategy.

00:10:11,033 --> 00:10:12,801
And if you can't get
a license, what then?

00:10:12,801 --> 00:10:13,836
It reverts back to them.

00:10:13,836 --> 00:10:16,939
So, Corey, let's
just keep in mind

00:10:16,939 --> 00:10:18,908
the person who first made you
the offer...

00:10:18,908 --> 00:10:21,676
Yes.
...Was me.

00:10:21,676 --> 00:10:23,912
Mark is simply tagging along
on my offer.

00:10:23,912 --> 00:10:25,413
Yeah.

00:10:25,413 --> 00:10:28,650
Kevin's royalty deal
is just ludicrous.

00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,618
You can't do that.
You need both of those options.

00:10:30,618 --> 00:10:31,586
Right.
I don't know.

00:10:31,586 --> 00:10:32,787
You should think about that.

00:10:32,787 --> 00:10:34,122
My offers are
always very well thought-out.

00:10:34,122 --> 00:10:36,691
Guys, you -- you already know
what's going on here, right?

00:10:36,691 --> 00:10:38,526
Robert didn't quite get
it, so he asked for a
chunk of the company.

00:10:38,526 --> 00:10:39,559
Kevin did
what he always does...

00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:41,094
That's ridiculous.
I got it right away.

00:10:41,094 --> 00:10:42,496
...And put out
a ridiculous offer.

00:10:42,496 --> 00:10:43,964
Why do you want
to manufacture anything?

00:10:43,964 --> 00:10:45,532
Why do you want to go
through that headache?

00:10:45,532 --> 00:10:47,234
Look, if someone comes along
and makes the right offer

00:10:47,234 --> 00:10:50,170
on a licensing deal,
yeah, absolutely, right?

00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,672
But the biggest upside
for this company

00:10:51,672 --> 00:10:54,107
is going to come
from ongoing development.

00:10:54,107 --> 00:10:55,342
You know,
that's ridiculous.

00:10:55,342 --> 00:10:58,311
You could get a $4 million
advance on your license,

00:10:58,311 --> 00:11:00,212
fund your next five ideas
from it,

00:11:00,212 --> 00:11:02,848
and never spend an hour
in the plant.

00:11:02,848 --> 00:11:04,216
You guys are nuts.
EGAN:
I think the challenge

00:11:04,216 --> 00:11:06,085
that I'm seeing is,
you know, we do --

00:11:06,085 --> 00:11:07,219
the patents are pending,

00:11:07,219 --> 00:11:08,554
and, you know, we've put
a lot in to that.

00:11:08,554 --> 00:11:11,090
It's getting
from here to there.

00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:13,326
Are your patents gonna clear
or not? What do you think?

00:11:13,326 --> 00:11:15,393
Even if they don't --
oh, I'm sorry, my friend.

00:11:15,393 --> 00:11:16,828
If they don't, you've got
a world of hurt.

00:11:16,828 --> 00:11:18,396
You're just off to --
no, 'cause you're just
off to the races,

00:11:18,396 --> 00:11:20,432
and it's a real business --
just a nice small
light-bulb manufacturer.

00:11:20,432 --> 00:11:21,800
Look,
in my perfect world,

00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,969
all the patents for software
go away anyways,

00:11:23,969 --> 00:11:25,203
and you just hustle
and you grind.
this is not software.

00:11:25,203 --> 00:11:27,105
It's a little bit of
a feeding frenzy in the tank.

00:11:27,105 --> 00:11:28,373
EGAN: Yes.
HERJAVEC: Corey, look.

00:11:28,373 --> 00:11:31,376
You know what?
I'm out.

00:11:31,376 --> 00:11:33,143
And I'll tell you why I wanted
so much equity.

00:11:33,143 --> 00:11:35,546
It was simply commensurate
with the risk.

00:11:35,546 --> 00:11:39,049
I don't see
that wide a market.

00:11:39,049 --> 00:11:41,919
So I think you've got one
equity offer, and you've
got and a royalty offer.

00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:43,320
So, guys, he's out.
EGAN: Yeah.

00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,722
Kevin's offer
is ridiculous.

00:11:44,722 --> 00:11:48,092
My offer's great. I just want
you to deliver the patent.

00:11:48,092 --> 00:11:49,827
Kevin, I'm gonna get him
to write a software program

00:11:49,827 --> 00:11:52,161
that just puts a puppet there
and just recalculates

00:11:52,161 --> 00:11:54,497
the same offer
and just the same offer.
because I'm right
every time,

00:11:54,497 --> 00:11:56,165
over and over and over.
enough! enough, guys.

00:11:56,165 --> 00:11:57,400
Corey,
if you go with Mark,

00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,369
you're gonna listen
to this every day.

00:12:02,872 --> 00:12:04,474
EGAN: So, first of all,

00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:08,044
I want to thank you all
for your time today again.

00:12:08,044 --> 00:12:10,012
Kevin, we appreciate the offer,
but it doesn't really match

00:12:10,012 --> 00:12:12,614
with the vision for what
we're trying to achieve.

00:12:12,614 --> 00:12:13,615
You want
to make light bulbs.

00:12:13,615 --> 00:12:14,850
We want to make
light bulbs

00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:19,121
and make a great business
and bring ilumi to the world.

00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:21,323
Mark, would you be willing
to meet in the middle

00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:24,426
at 20% for the $350,000?

00:12:27,328 --> 00:12:28,662
I'm gonna stick
to the 25%, guys,

00:12:28,662 --> 00:12:30,731
'cause you know I can bring
a huge amount of value.

00:12:30,731 --> 00:12:33,834
Could I ask you --
I think everyone in here

00:12:33,834 --> 00:12:35,536
could pick up the phone
and make one phone call

00:12:35,536 --> 00:12:36,871
that could change the game
for us.

00:12:36,871 --> 00:12:39,740
Who would be
your phone call?

00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,742
Depends on who we need
to call.

00:12:41,742 --> 00:12:43,744
All right? There's nobody
that's not gonna take my call.

00:12:48,481 --> 00:12:50,250
Good answer.

00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,551
That's a good answer.

00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:52,786
Okay, Mark.
You've got a deal.

00:12:52,786 --> 00:12:53,720
I knew it.
Let's go to work.

00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,556
GREINER: Good deal.

00:12:56,556 --> 00:12:57,957
Congratulations.
It's a great program, guys.

00:12:57,957 --> 00:12:59,192
Thank you.
Congratulations, man.

00:12:59,192 --> 00:13:01,528
I'm looking forward
to it. Yes, sir.
Thanks, Mark.

00:13:01,528 --> 00:13:02,896
That's what
I'm talking about.
Live your lights.

00:13:02,896 --> 00:13:04,596
Live your lights.
Light up your life, baby.

00:13:04,596 --> 00:13:05,697
Mark, I want one.

00:13:06,865 --> 00:13:10,135
EGAN: Working with Mark,
it's gonna be a tremendous fit.

00:13:10,135 --> 00:13:12,538
He gets the technology
that we're bringing

00:13:12,538 --> 00:13:14,506
and our vision
to make it happen.

00:13:14,506 --> 00:13:16,942
Mark's just gonna be
like fuel on the fire.

00:13:16,942 --> 00:13:19,445
It's -- this thing is gonna
spread like wildfire,

00:13:19,445 --> 00:13:21,546
and ilumi's gonna shine
across the world.

00:13:26,651 --> 00:13:28,686
NARRATOR:
Earlier this season,

00:13:28,686 --> 00:13:31,389
Charles yim made a deal
with all five sharks

00:13:31,389 --> 00:13:33,124
for his smartphone breathalyzer,
Breathometer.

00:13:33,124 --> 00:13:36,461
All five sharks will give you
$1 million for 30%.

00:13:36,461 --> 00:13:38,362
I accept.
All right.
GREINER: Whoo!

00:13:38,362 --> 00:13:39,963
NARRATOR: Let's see
what's happening now.

00:13:39,963 --> 00:13:42,799
Since "Shark Tank,"
it's been crazy busy.

00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:44,401
We've got a ton
of pre-orders --

00:13:44,401 --> 00:13:46,303
actually more than we can
even catch up with.

00:13:46,303 --> 00:13:49,773
When I first went in the tank,
we only had $140,000 in sales.

00:13:49,773 --> 00:13:51,608
After closing a deal
with all five sharks,

00:13:51,608 --> 00:13:54,044
we closed $1 million
in just three months.

00:13:54,044 --> 00:13:55,112
We had to scale up
our production

00:13:55,112 --> 00:13:56,379
just to keep up
with the demand.

00:13:56,379 --> 00:13:58,514
Charles.
Hey, Kevin.

00:13:58,514 --> 00:14:00,950
O'LEARY: I came to the bay area
today to check in on Charles.

00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,118
It's unique
that we have a deal

00:14:02,118 --> 00:14:03,752
where every shark has put
their money to work.

00:14:03,752 --> 00:14:06,555
Everybody knows this thing is
going to be very successful.

00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:07,690
I'm their eyes today.

00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:08,802
I'm getting
a lot of e-mails

00:14:08,802 --> 00:14:10,370
from people that do not have
their device yet.
Right.

00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,939
What are you doing
about it?

00:14:11,939 --> 00:14:14,074
Being back-ordered is
not a good problem.

00:14:14,074 --> 00:14:16,475
You want happy customers,
not ones that are waiting
for their product.

00:14:16,475 --> 00:14:17,810
I have to come here
and beat him with a stick.

00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:18,845
We were only manufacturing

00:14:18,845 --> 00:14:20,079
roughly about 1,000 units
a week.

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,014
Now we're at 15,000 units
a week.

00:14:22,014 --> 00:14:23,950
We'll be, in about three
weeks, current with
all our pre-orders.

00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,718
And then the backlog
will be filled.
Yep.

00:14:25,718 --> 00:14:26,819
The operation looks
like it's working.

00:14:26,819 --> 00:14:27,954
He's been delayed.

00:14:27,954 --> 00:14:29,755
Now he's getting the product
out the door.

00:14:29,755 --> 00:14:30,923
This is important.

00:14:30,923 --> 00:14:32,525
Hey, guys.
Look who stopped by.

00:14:32,525 --> 00:14:34,926
YIM: Working with all five
sharks has been amazing.

00:14:34,926 --> 00:14:37,429
Each brings value to the table
in a very different, unique way.

00:14:37,429 --> 00:14:39,531
Kevin's been helping us
with international distribution.

00:14:39,531 --> 00:14:40,599
Mark's been instrumental

00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:42,167
in bringing us
to big-box retailers.

00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:44,336
Lori's working on helping us
get on QVC.

00:14:44,336 --> 00:14:46,671
Robert and Daymond
have helped us with
distribution here in the U.S.,

00:14:46,671 --> 00:14:49,841
but on top of that,
they've really helped
us refine our branding.

00:14:49,841 --> 00:14:51,876
JOHN: You know, not only
  are you saving lives,

00:14:51,876 --> 00:14:53,277
I know you want to make it

00:14:53,277 --> 00:14:55,279
more of a science technology
  and medical company.

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,214
We're now more than just
a smartphone breathalyzer.

00:14:57,214 --> 00:14:59,049
We're moving on to things
like halitosis,

00:14:59,049 --> 00:15:01,151
dehydration, diabetes,
asthma.

00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:03,287
Our main goal is
to improve patient healthcare

00:15:03,287 --> 00:15:04,455
and continue saving lives.

00:15:04,455 --> 00:15:06,824
So to be able to see the company
launch a product

00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:09,325
and create new jobs
in just three months,

00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,426
it's an amazing feeling
to have.

00:15:22,974 --> 00:15:24,942
My name
is Felix Brandon Lloyd,

00:15:24,942 --> 00:15:27,377
and this is my wife,
Jordan Lloyd Bookey.

00:15:27,377 --> 00:15:30,046
We live in Washington, D.C.,
with our two beautiful kids,

00:15:30,046 --> 00:15:31,782
and we're the founders
of Zoobean.

00:15:31,782 --> 00:15:33,049
Whee!
[ laughs ]

00:15:33,049 --> 00:15:35,218
My son received
a book in the mail

00:15:35,218 --> 00:15:36,354
from a family friend.

00:15:36,354 --> 00:15:37,822
And he so loved this book,

00:15:37,822 --> 00:15:39,156
both because it was
a wonderful story

00:15:39,156 --> 00:15:41,225
and it pictured
a mixed family like ours.

00:15:41,225 --> 00:15:43,060
Everybody's going
in the water.

00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,262
JORDAN: He read it every day
that week.

00:15:45,262 --> 00:15:46,930
And it was a very powerful
experience for us.

00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,798
And it dawned on us
that we could create

00:15:48,798 --> 00:15:51,601
this delightful experience
for families everywhere.

00:15:51,601 --> 00:15:53,270
That's why
we created Zoobean.

00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:57,207
Felix and I have both been
in education for many years.

00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:59,843
For us, education is
really everything.

00:15:59,843 --> 00:16:02,345
It is the one thing
that if we get it right,

00:16:02,345 --> 00:16:05,814
it can help change the
trajectory of anybody's life.

00:16:05,814 --> 00:16:07,082
Zoobean means to us

00:16:07,082 --> 00:16:09,885
an opportunity to make
a difference in the world

00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,553
and make a difference
in our own lives

00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:12,655
and our children's lives.

00:16:12,655 --> 00:16:14,857
[ laughter ]

00:16:28,102 --> 00:16:29,937
Hi.
My name's Jordan.

00:16:29,937 --> 00:16:32,340
But when it comes
to business,

00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,709
you can call me
the chief mom.

00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:37,545
And I'm Felix --
of course, the chief dad.

00:16:37,545 --> 00:16:40,180
Our company
is called Zoobean,

00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,683
and we're seeking
a $250,000 investment

00:16:42,683 --> 00:16:45,218
in exchange
for 15% equity.

00:16:45,218 --> 00:16:47,120
We first met
as teachers.

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,323
But it's
when we became parents

00:16:49,323 --> 00:16:51,191
that building
our kids' love of reading

00:16:51,191 --> 00:16:52,592
became more personal.

00:16:52,592 --> 00:16:54,461
The truth is,
we found it difficult

00:16:54,461 --> 00:16:55,862
to discover children's books

00:16:55,862 --> 00:16:57,997
that met our kids'
particular interests

00:16:57,997 --> 00:16:59,999
or that pictured families
like ours.

00:16:59,999 --> 00:17:02,501
And that's
why we created Zoobean,

00:17:02,501 --> 00:17:04,870
a children's book
discovery platform

00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,740
and highly personalized
subscription service.

00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,609
So, Zoobean uses filters

00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:13,979
like recommended age,
language,

00:17:13,979 --> 00:17:16,481
interests like
not-so-pink girls,

00:17:16,481 --> 00:17:17,716
or main character's
background,

00:17:17,716 --> 00:17:19,818
like being
from a mixed family.

00:17:19,818 --> 00:17:23,355
That way, our platform
curates the right book

00:17:23,355 --> 00:17:25,924
and eventually
other products.

00:17:25,924 --> 00:17:28,393
For us, Zoobean is
as much our mission

00:17:28,393 --> 00:17:29,794
as it is our business.

00:17:29,794 --> 00:17:32,097
Sharks, please join us
in helping

00:17:32,097 --> 00:17:34,998
all of our kids imagine
and achieve anything.

00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:37,601
So, you're pre-selecting
for them,

00:17:37,601 --> 00:17:38,702
making the task easier.

00:17:38,702 --> 00:17:41,271
I-I lived in this space
for 12 years,

00:17:41,271 --> 00:17:42,906
and I'm gonna guess
that 80% of your sales

00:17:42,906 --> 00:17:45,576
are between the ages of 3 and 8
years old, okay?

00:17:45,576 --> 00:17:47,244
So, here's the problem --

00:17:47,244 --> 00:17:50,347
in actually acquiring
the customer at that age,

00:17:50,347 --> 00:17:54,016
for every company that's tried,
has been a huge challenge

00:17:54,016 --> 00:17:56,552
in actually the cost
of customer acquisition

00:17:56,552 --> 00:17:58,988
because you've got
about 20 million people

00:17:58,988 --> 00:18:02,024
moving through that zone
every 12 months.

00:18:02,024 --> 00:18:03,593
This is the whole business,
my friends.

00:18:03,593 --> 00:18:05,061
That's all there is
to worry about.

00:18:05,061 --> 00:18:07,830
Do you know what your
customer-acquisition cost is?

00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:11,066
Customer-acquisitions cost
is about $6.03.

00:18:11,066 --> 00:18:13,268
Wow.
How many have you
been able to get?

00:18:13,268 --> 00:18:14,603
How many subscribers
do you have?

00:18:14,603 --> 00:18:16,238
We have 85 subscribers
and gifters.

00:18:17,506 --> 00:18:19,207
HERJAVEC: 85,000?

00:18:19,207 --> 00:18:21,309
85 subscribers
and gifters.

00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:24,212
We launched a beta version
just two months ago.

00:18:24,212 --> 00:18:27,314
It seems to me there's a need
for what you're doing.

00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,418
I don't know, though. Is there
other competition out there?

00:18:30,418 --> 00:18:32,219
Yeah, Amazon.

00:18:32,219 --> 00:18:33,421
[ chuckles ]

00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:35,055
Is this something
that people are really needing

00:18:35,055 --> 00:18:36,957
and you're fulfilling that
in the marketplace?

00:18:36,957 --> 00:18:38,325
I think I can start
to answer

00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,060
by -- by finishing
how the product works.

00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,229
As a user, you can come
to the site

00:18:42,229 --> 00:18:43,831
and state a number
of preferences.

00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,265
Once all that data's
in there,

00:18:45,265 --> 00:18:47,700
automatically our system
will then query and say,

00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,171
"Mr. Cuban's child has
a reading level this level,

00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,639
is interested in this type
of subject, these --"

00:18:52,639 --> 00:18:54,040
Okay, so, that's
still very simple search

00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,041
based off of tags, right,

00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,976
which isn't going
to get you very far

00:18:56,976 --> 00:18:58,711
because you can put together
lists on Amazon,

00:18:58,711 --> 00:19:02,549
and you can even put together
subscriptions on Amazon.

00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:05,217
What I'm trying to do is figure
out if there is a secret sauce.

00:19:05,217 --> 00:19:07,686
Yes. Right.
Right.
What's the secret sauce?

00:19:07,686 --> 00:19:09,455
It's the difference
between Google

00:19:09,455 --> 00:19:11,256
and another search engine,
right?

00:19:11,256 --> 00:19:13,158
What is it
that makes you different?

00:19:13,158 --> 00:19:15,194
Technology-wise,
when you look at it,

00:19:15,194 --> 00:19:18,530
the back end is data
and -- and -- and
matching tags with data.

00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:23,134
Firstly, we assign a relevant
score to each of those users.

00:19:23,134 --> 00:19:25,203
Okay.
And that relevant score
is based

00:19:25,203 --> 00:19:26,737
on those tags
being weighted.

00:19:26,737 --> 00:19:29,073
And then it becomes informed
by user behavior.

00:19:29,073 --> 00:19:31,108
And then we say
these are the potential items

00:19:31,108 --> 00:19:32,977
that could match up
with this.

00:19:32,977 --> 00:19:35,379
So, the difference
between you and Amazon

00:19:35,379 --> 00:19:36,781
is you're more specific.

00:19:36,781 --> 00:19:37,982
But I think, though,

00:19:37,982 --> 00:19:40,083
there's nothing really
that unique.

00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:43,954
And so, for that reason,
I'm out.

00:19:43,954 --> 00:19:46,857
I'm sorry to hear that.
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:19:46,857 --> 00:19:48,758
CORCORAN:
Help me with an example.

00:19:48,758 --> 00:19:50,927
I have a 7-year-old daughter
who's adopted.

00:19:50,927 --> 00:19:53,363
And when she was born,
I went on Amazon.

00:19:53,363 --> 00:19:55,031
So here's a perfect parallel.

00:19:55,031 --> 00:19:58,067
A specialty --
I wanted to find

00:19:58,067 --> 00:20:00,536
every book on adoption
and storybooks for children.

00:20:00,536 --> 00:20:02,238
Yes.

00:20:02,238 --> 00:20:03,706
What would have been
different

00:20:03,706 --> 00:20:05,841
if I had gone on your website
and had that same experience?

00:20:05,841 --> 00:20:07,610
If you'd gone on our website,
first of all,

00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,512
it would have been probably
a more pleasant experience.

00:20:09,512 --> 00:20:11,614
You'd go through, you'd -- you'd
look, and you'd see adoption.

00:20:11,614 --> 00:20:14,283
Then you might want,
you know,

00:20:14,283 --> 00:20:16,251
female characters,
for example, for your --

00:20:16,251 --> 00:20:18,386
in other words, if I had
something very specific.

00:20:18,386 --> 00:20:20,688
Now I want it just about little
girls who are adopted.

00:20:20,688 --> 00:20:22,690
I could put
female adoption?

00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:23,658
Right.
Correct. Correct.

00:20:23,658 --> 00:20:24,792
That have
female characters --

00:20:24,792 --> 00:20:25,727
so -- so to Lori's point --

00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,128
I-I think
she was clear on that.

00:20:27,128 --> 00:20:28,997
I really don't think there's
a need for the business,

00:20:28,997 --> 00:20:31,533
so I am out.

00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,136
Jordan, tell us
a little about your background.

00:20:36,136 --> 00:20:38,639
Jordan just left her job
as head of k--
a week ago.

00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:40,240
A week -- a week ago

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,309
as head of k-through-12
education at Google.

00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:44,111
GREINER: Oh, wow.
Wow.
CORCORAN: To focus
on this full-time?

00:20:44,111 --> 00:20:45,245
Yes.

00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:47,381
HERJAVEC: Felix,
what's your background?

00:20:47,381 --> 00:20:49,416
I'm Washington --
I'm a former Washington,
D.C., teacher of the year.

00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:53,019
And then after that, I left
and started a technology venture

00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:54,754
that I had an exit from
three years ago.

00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,689
It was kids-
and education-related.

00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:58,391
I think you guys
are very solid

00:20:58,391 --> 00:21:00,993
'cause my children
are voracious readers.

00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:01,994
Yes.
JORDAN: Yes.

00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,896
HERJAVEC:
But I got to tell you,

00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:06,232
they can go online,
and they can search

00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:09,267
for almost any book that they
want to find today.

00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:13,438
And I just currently don't see
it today. I'm out.

00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,107
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:21,379
Finding the customer
and getting the full value,

00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:23,081
which is really
only about five years,

00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:25,584
I don't know if you're gonna get
there with this baby.

00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:29,787
I'm not kidding. It's --
it's a -- it's gonna be
a really tough, uh, ride.

00:21:29,787 --> 00:21:31,021
But isn't that
what it's about?

00:21:31,021 --> 00:21:32,556
Isn't business about a struggle?
I mean, Jeff Bezos --

00:21:32,556 --> 00:21:34,525
I get it.
I get all that.

00:21:34,525 --> 00:21:36,660
But I just -- I-I'm trying
to find a way to get excited

00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,028
because this is my space --
or was my space.

00:21:38,028 --> 00:21:39,363
Well, get excited
about changing the world.

00:21:39,363 --> 00:21:40,864
No, I --
you know,
one of these things that --

00:21:40,864 --> 00:21:42,666
listen to me, seriously.
I don't want to change
the world.

00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,435
I want to make money.
He doesn't get excited
about that, Felix.

00:21:44,435 --> 00:21:45,868
I know that. M-making money
changes the world.

00:21:45,868 --> 00:21:47,837
You come into the shark tank,
you get all of these sharks

00:21:47,837 --> 00:21:50,707
that have had experience
in different sectors.
mm-hmm.

00:21:50,707 --> 00:21:54,477
And it -- we're a venture
capital firm on steroids.
There's nobody like us.

00:21:54,477 --> 00:21:56,379
You're all hearing
the different challenges

00:21:56,379 --> 00:21:58,314
from -- from all of us,
and -- and the one --

00:21:58,314 --> 00:22:00,750
the only one I care about is
the one that I've lived through,

00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,352
which is
customer-acquisition cost.

00:22:02,352 --> 00:22:04,219
I think you'll do a great job
monetizing it

00:22:04,219 --> 00:22:05,253
after you've got them.

00:22:05,253 --> 00:22:06,622
But I think
they're gonna cost you

00:22:06,622 --> 00:22:07,990
more than you'll make
off of them.

00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:10,125
And for that reason, I'm out.

00:22:14,229 --> 00:22:15,397
Is everybody else out?

00:22:15,397 --> 00:22:16,431
Yeah.
Good.

00:22:16,431 --> 00:22:19,134
Guys, I-I disagree
completely.

00:22:19,134 --> 00:22:21,836
I think trusted curation
is the future.

00:22:21,836 --> 00:22:25,406
The question is,
what's after books?

00:22:25,406 --> 00:22:29,010
Because the value in
this has nothing to do
with books, right?

00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:31,579
It has everything to do

00:22:31,579 --> 00:22:33,781
with helping grandma
find something

00:22:33,781 --> 00:22:35,783
when she has no idea
what to get.

00:22:35,783 --> 00:22:37,385
Absolutely.

00:22:37,385 --> 00:22:39,886
But you haven't convinced me
that you've got something,

00:22:39,886 --> 00:22:42,322
or -- and you haven't told me
why you've got something

00:22:42,322 --> 00:22:43,523
that allows that to happen

00:22:43,523 --> 00:22:46,092
in a way that someone else
can't do.

00:22:46,092 --> 00:22:48,962
Now, somebody else can do it,
but we're gonna do it better.

00:22:48,962 --> 00:22:51,064
It's a huge --
but you got to tell me how
you're gonna do it better.

00:22:51,064 --> 00:22:52,465
No one says --
no one comes in here and says,

00:22:52,465 --> 00:22:53,833
"You know what, Mark?
I'm gonna do it worse,"

00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:55,502
or, "I'm just gonna
do it average,"

00:22:55,502 --> 00:22:57,670
or, "I'm gonna do it
the same as everybody else."
You haven't explained to me.

00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,538
Because, Mark, you see --
you see an awful lot
of technology plays.

00:22:59,538 --> 00:23:01,240
This is not
a technology company.

00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,608
But that's what I'm trying
to figure out, 'cause --

00:23:02,608 --> 00:23:03,742
it's not.
it's a marketing company.

00:23:03,742 --> 00:23:05,611
Let me decide
if it's technology or not, okay?

00:23:05,611 --> 00:23:07,513
Yeah, but they're not even
telling you they're playing
it on a technology platform.

00:23:07,513 --> 00:23:08,714
That's like saying Google is
just a search company, right?

00:23:08,714 --> 00:23:10,182
Right.
It's -- it's just not,
right?

00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:13,118
Right.
Because I'm trying to figure out
where this can go.

00:23:13,118 --> 00:23:15,920
Yes, thank you.
Right? What --
what is it capable of doing?

00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,523
Right.
Could the software
be extended

00:23:18,523 --> 00:23:20,324
so that if you created
an inventory

00:23:20,324 --> 00:23:23,428
of all the children's-oriented
shows on Netflix...

00:23:23,428 --> 00:23:25,563
Yes.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
...All the movies
on Netflix...

00:23:25,563 --> 00:23:28,032
...And a current
programing guide...
Yes.

00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:29,367
...From all the different
TV networks...

00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:30,401
Yes.
Yes.

00:23:30,401 --> 00:23:32,704
...Could I go in there
and it would tell me

00:23:32,704 --> 00:23:34,337
which shows are appropriate
and recommend which?
Yes.

00:23:34,337 --> 00:23:35,806
Exactly what it could do.
Yes, exactly.

00:23:35,806 --> 00:23:38,308
CUBAN: So now if, all
of a sudden, you're
saying, Zoobean,

00:23:38,308 --> 00:23:41,445
you're not quite sure what shows
your kids can watch, right?

00:23:41,445 --> 00:23:42,546
Mm-hmm.
Right.

00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,047
Put in this data,
we'll show you

00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,349
which shows are applicable,
whether it's Netflix...

00:23:46,349 --> 00:23:47,984
Yes.
...Whether it's Hulu,
whether it's anywhere.

00:23:47,984 --> 00:23:49,453
And, oh, by the way,
buy our books.

00:23:49,453 --> 00:23:51,320
Now you're getting
two different ways to populate.

00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,822
Yes.
But that's happening
already.

00:23:52,822 --> 00:23:53,956
Oh, my goodness.

00:23:53,956 --> 00:23:56,158
No, not -- not within
one centralized location.

00:23:56,158 --> 00:23:58,327
Yeah? Check out Disney.
No, not -- not --

00:23:58,327 --> 00:23:59,562
no, I'm not talking about
TV guides and everything.

00:23:59,562 --> 00:24:01,530
I'm -- out-outside of Disney,
you want someplace,

00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:04,433
'cause not all Disney's gonna be
appropriate for what you do.
right.

00:24:04,433 --> 00:24:07,336
It's got to be
independent. Okay.
Right.

00:24:07,336 --> 00:24:10,305
So, guys, if that's the case,
I'll make you an offer.
FELIX: All right.

00:24:10,305 --> 00:24:14,042
250k, but I need
30% of the business.

00:24:15,577 --> 00:24:17,979
Would you consider 20%?

00:24:20,348 --> 00:24:21,850
I'll meet you
in the middle.

00:24:26,654 --> 00:24:28,789
Mark, we are excited and
ecstatic to accept your offer.

00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:30,657
Let's do this.
Thank you.

00:24:30,657 --> 00:24:31,825
Hey, you're -- you're nice guys.
We'll do a deal.

00:24:31,825 --> 00:24:32,893
Poker face not -- not
as good as you.

00:24:32,893 --> 00:24:34,027
Thank you, Mark.
My pleasure.

00:24:34,027 --> 00:24:36,163
Great deal. Good luck.
Thanks. Thank you.

00:24:36,163 --> 00:24:38,465
[ laughter ]

00:24:38,465 --> 00:24:40,467
It's the same thing
about Netflix.

00:24:40,467 --> 00:24:43,137
Netflix at the beginning
and the recommendation engine
started with nothing.

00:24:43,137 --> 00:24:45,138
This has
to go through that.
But, Mark, Netflix had

00:24:45,138 --> 00:24:46,572
a unique proposition
out of the gate.
no, they didn't.

00:24:46,572 --> 00:24:48,174
Sure, they did.
No, they didn't.

00:24:48,174 --> 00:24:50,009
Netflix's big angle was
data, and they put cash
up front to get content.

00:24:50,009 --> 00:24:51,644
Look. This is
a very binary business.

00:24:51,644 --> 00:24:54,247
It's either a home run, or --
or it's a strikeout, right?

00:24:54,247 --> 00:24:55,915
And if they hit it,
it's enormous.

00:25:04,756 --> 00:25:07,726
NARRATOR: Next up are
father-and-son entrepreneurs

00:25:07,726 --> 00:25:10,395
with a unique
food-preservation system.

00:25:15,767 --> 00:25:17,602
Hi.
My name is Chase Hoyt.

00:25:17,602 --> 00:25:20,005
And this is my father.
I'm Bob Hoyt.

00:25:20,005 --> 00:25:21,672
We're from Tucson, Arizona,

00:25:21,672 --> 00:25:24,708
and our company is
Intelli-Stopper Technology.

00:25:24,708 --> 00:25:26,210
We're seeking $250,000

00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:28,779
in exchange
for 10% equity.

00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:31,448
Sharks,
our Intelli-Stopper Technology

00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:33,717
will redefine
and revolutionize

00:25:33,717 --> 00:25:36,453
food and beverage
preservation.

00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:38,522
The problem
with current wine preservers is

00:25:38,522 --> 00:25:40,890
you never know when
you've pumped out the
right amount of air,

00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,859
and you never know when air gets
back into the bottle.

00:25:42,859 --> 00:25:44,627
And preservers on the market
allow air

00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:47,597
to seep back in within minutes
to hours of preserving.

00:25:47,597 --> 00:25:51,100
So, Mr. Wonderful,
that very expensive bottle

00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,736
of '69 Château Margaux
that you have is being --

00:25:53,736 --> 00:25:55,471
just one of many.
just one --

00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:56,506
is being exposed to oxygen

00:25:56,506 --> 00:25:58,073
when you think
it's being preserved...

00:25:58,073 --> 00:25:59,408
Until now.

00:25:59,408 --> 00:26:01,877
The intelli-stopper is
the first preserver

00:26:01,877 --> 00:26:04,546
on the market that has
a red visual indicator.

00:26:04,546 --> 00:26:05,848
So for the first time,

00:26:05,848 --> 00:26:08,550
you can see that all
of your wine is preserved.

00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,319
Let me show you
how it works.

00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:13,455
But before I do,
how about I hand out some wine?

00:26:13,455 --> 00:26:14,923
Absolutely. Great idea.
Sure.

00:26:18,192 --> 00:26:19,393
Here we go.

00:26:19,393 --> 00:26:20,962
Thank you.
There you go.

00:26:20,962 --> 00:26:22,063
Lori.
It's better than boxed.

00:26:22,063 --> 00:26:22,997
Ladies first.
Thank you.

00:26:22,997 --> 00:26:23,831
There we go.

00:26:23,831 --> 00:26:25,199
Thank you.
Absolutely.

00:26:25,199 --> 00:26:26,601
There you go.
Cheers.

00:26:26,601 --> 00:26:28,169
Mr. Wonderful.
Thank you.

00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,337
Absolutely.
Thank you.

00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,638
CORCORAN: It's free.
It might not be as good

00:26:30,638 --> 00:26:33,306
as O'Leary fine wines,
but it's pretty darn good.

00:26:33,306 --> 00:26:34,674
Of course. Thank you.
I'm sure
it's much better.

00:26:34,674 --> 00:26:37,844
There we go.
So, drink up, you guys.

00:26:37,844 --> 00:26:40,380
Thank you.
If I -- if I have a sip of this
and I go blind,

00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,582
there'll be hell to pay.
It's great wine.

00:26:42,582 --> 00:26:45,185
Okay, that wine has
been preserved with
the intelli-stopper.

00:26:45,185 --> 00:26:46,853
How long was it
since it was opened?

00:26:46,853 --> 00:26:49,155
Five days.
Okay.

00:26:49,155 --> 00:26:51,190
Well -- well, show us
how it works, Chase.
Sure. Absolutely.

00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:53,025
We've had a few glasses
of wine.

00:26:53,025 --> 00:26:55,194
Put the stopper in the top
of the bottle.

00:26:55,194 --> 00:26:58,230
You can see that red indicator
is up right now

00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:00,900
because, obviously, there's
still oxygen in there.

00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,034
Pump the air out,

00:27:02,034 --> 00:27:04,503
and you'll see
that red indicator goes down.

00:27:04,503 --> 00:27:06,438
When you see a clear window,

00:27:06,438 --> 00:27:08,207
you know that your wine
is preserved.

00:27:08,207 --> 00:27:10,108
So, by taking the air
out of it...

00:27:10,108 --> 00:27:12,310
Yes.
...It -- the wine
lasts longer.

00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,511
Absolutely.
Yeah, so --

00:27:13,511 --> 00:27:15,546
so if I don't do
the preserver thing...
Yeah.

00:27:15,546 --> 00:27:17,282
...How long will
the wine last?

00:27:17,282 --> 00:27:20,685
So, on average, um, maybe
two days, maybe three days.
That's it?

00:27:20,685 --> 00:27:22,453
And that bottle of wine,
how long will that last?

00:27:22,453 --> 00:27:24,722
With this product, it will
last up to two weeks.

00:27:24,722 --> 00:27:26,891
If air gets back
in that bottle,

00:27:26,891 --> 00:27:30,460
you're gonna see the red
indicator creeps right back up.

00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,695
O'LEARY:
Yeah, but, Chase --

00:27:31,695 --> 00:27:32,863
so you can visually see that
your wine is preserved.

00:27:32,863 --> 00:27:35,299
I have, I don't know,
six cellars now...

00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:36,466
Sure.

00:27:36,466 --> 00:27:38,435
...With tens of thousands
of bottles of wine.

00:27:38,435 --> 00:27:41,405
I own every single preservation
system ever made...

00:27:41,405 --> 00:27:42,706
Yeah.
...Including the ones

00:27:42,706 --> 00:27:45,641
that do nitrogen, argon gas,
you name it.
Right.

00:27:45,641 --> 00:27:48,778
Yours is a derivative
of a very popular one

00:27:48,778 --> 00:27:51,647
that does do $15 million
in sales.

00:27:51,647 --> 00:27:53,683
You've added an indicator
that air goes in.

00:27:53,683 --> 00:27:56,419
That's the only difference,
right?
Yes.

00:27:56,419 --> 00:27:57,653
Is this
the only product?

00:27:57,653 --> 00:28:00,089
We have four skus
with this product line.

00:28:00,089 --> 00:28:02,191
Okay.
And we are extending
into multiple markets.

00:28:02,191 --> 00:28:03,258
Chase,
what were your sales?

00:28:03,258 --> 00:28:05,327
Last year,
we sold $150,000.

00:28:05,327 --> 00:28:08,096
This year, we're on pace
to sell $300,000.

00:28:08,096 --> 00:28:11,866
And we just locked
a major retailer,

00:28:11,866 --> 00:28:13,068
which is really exciting.

00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:15,437
Which one?
Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.
Really?

00:28:15,437 --> 00:28:17,839
People that are passionate
about wine buy everything.

00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:19,774
I'll buy one, but for me
to get my head

00:28:19,774 --> 00:28:21,742
around a value
of $2 1/2 million...

00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:24,144
As a start-up company,
you should never argue value.

00:28:24,144 --> 00:28:26,947
Instead, we have to show you
a-a limited perception of risk,

00:28:26,947 --> 00:28:28,549
and that's exactly
what we've done...

00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:30,184
Oh, well said.
...Because what we have --

00:28:30,184 --> 00:28:32,753
proof of concept,
we have growing sales,

00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:35,556
we've got proof of market,
we've got patented
intellectual property.

00:28:35,556 --> 00:28:37,391
All right, so what's next?
Okay, so what's next?

00:28:37,391 --> 00:28:39,192
So, we're taking all of this
technology to --

00:28:39,192 --> 00:28:43,529
the first is olive-oil
preservation with olivedoctor.

00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:45,531
Think about the olive oil
that you have

00:28:45,531 --> 00:28:47,800
that sits on your counter
or in your cupboard

00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,435
that goes
stale and rancid.

00:28:49,435 --> 00:28:50,903
You use it for --
olive oil goes stale?

00:28:50,903 --> 00:28:52,672
Absolutely. Actually --
I thought
it lasts forever.

00:28:52,672 --> 00:28:54,240
Or is it honey
that lasts forever?

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,742
Honey -- honey does
last forever.

00:28:55,742 --> 00:28:57,476
Does love last forever?

00:28:57,476 --> 00:28:59,344
O'LEARY: I know -- you know,
Robert, I know there's --

00:28:59,344 --> 00:29:01,179
there's somewhere on you
I could plug this in

00:29:01,179 --> 00:29:02,748
and suck the air out of you.

00:29:02,748 --> 00:29:04,182
[ laughter ]

00:29:04,182 --> 00:29:06,451
But once you get up
to about a month,

00:29:06,451 --> 00:29:08,787
depending on the olive oil,
it's rancid.

00:29:08,787 --> 00:29:10,188
Sealed?
There's one challenge

00:29:10,188 --> 00:29:11,390
with the high-end olive oils

00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,358
is that the bottle sizes
vary dramatically.

00:29:13,358 --> 00:29:15,426
I have a pretty large collection
of olive oils,

00:29:15,426 --> 00:29:17,762
and this would only work
in maybe 10% of the bottles.

00:29:17,762 --> 00:29:20,931
Really expensive oils are being
collected like wines now.

00:29:20,931 --> 00:29:22,166
It's in my wine cellar.
You collect oils?

00:29:22,166 --> 00:29:23,734
[ laughs ]
So when you open it up...

00:29:23,734 --> 00:29:25,503
But it's not black oil.
...You may have one or two
months to use it.

00:29:25,503 --> 00:29:28,472
I've got some oils
that are $300 a bottle.

00:29:28,472 --> 00:29:30,408
Do you really?
You got what?!
Yeah.

00:29:30,408 --> 00:29:32,777
What are your other applications
for this?

00:29:32,777 --> 00:29:35,845
The next, which we're very
excited about, is to coffee.

00:29:35,845 --> 00:29:39,883
So, 2.4 billion cups of coffee
are consumed every day.

00:29:39,883 --> 00:29:41,818
We can take our intelli-stopper
technology --

00:29:41,818 --> 00:29:43,486
Okay.
We know there's a big market.

00:29:43,486 --> 00:29:45,321
Do you have the patent
for any of this?

00:29:45,321 --> 00:29:46,689
Well, we have
three patents.

00:29:46,689 --> 00:29:48,058
We have two design patents --

00:29:48,058 --> 00:29:50,326
one in the U.S., the other is
in the European union --

00:29:50,326 --> 00:29:53,562
and we have pending
a functionality patent,

00:29:53,562 --> 00:29:56,532
and so we have
some protection on that.

00:29:56,532 --> 00:29:58,467
When you say functionality,
you mean utility patent?

00:29:58,467 --> 00:30:00,436
Utility.
Yeah.

00:30:00,436 --> 00:30:02,371
I feel like everybody
has seen dozens

00:30:02,371 --> 00:30:03,639
of these kinds of things

00:30:03,639 --> 00:30:06,008
claiming to preserve wine
in particular.

00:30:06,008 --> 00:30:07,843
And I, for one, have bought
many of them.

00:30:07,843 --> 00:30:10,411
Yeah.
I don't think there's
enough point of difference

00:30:10,411 --> 00:30:13,014
that makes this jump apart
from the crowd and me say,

00:30:13,014 --> 00:30:15,216
"Wow! I got to get
my hands on this thing."

00:30:15,216 --> 00:30:18,486
So, because it seems
like more of the same

00:30:18,486 --> 00:30:20,788
with a little twist,
I'm out.

00:30:20,788 --> 00:30:22,623
Okay.

00:30:22,623 --> 00:30:25,293
Guys, it's obvious that you've
built a better mousetrap.

00:30:25,293 --> 00:30:29,796
But I have no idea what
the mouse is and where it goes.

00:30:29,796 --> 00:30:31,765
People collect oils?
Seriously?

00:30:31,765 --> 00:30:33,834
I thought those things
get better with age.

00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:35,869
So, I mean, it's really not
a fit for me.

00:30:35,869 --> 00:30:37,504
So, for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:30:37,504 --> 00:30:41,775
GREINER: For me, the problem
here is, is I've seen a lot --

00:30:41,775 --> 00:30:43,844
I'm very familiar
with this space.

00:30:43,844 --> 00:30:47,046
And there are other products
out there very similar,

00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:48,214
so I'm out.

00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:51,750
Chase, let me make it
really simple.

00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,818
Not for me.
I'm out.

00:30:54,987 --> 00:30:57,990
So, I use your competitor
every day

00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:00,826
because I start my evening with
a single glass of Montrachet

00:31:00,826 --> 00:31:02,561
which often comes out
of a new bottle.

00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:04,329
And your breakfast
and your lunch.

00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:05,964
[ laughter ]
And then I -- then I stop it

00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:08,800
and put it back into the cooler
with the competing product.

00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,869
CHASE: Right.
And then I hit the reds.

00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,872
Mm-hmm.
So, I generally have
two bottles stopped.

00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:17,976
The reason they have my business
is they have the distribution.

00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:22,212
I think the problem with this
deal is the value put on it.

00:31:22,212 --> 00:31:23,680
There's so much we could be
doing together

00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,882
if you weren't
such greedy pigs.

00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:26,116
[ chuckles ]

00:31:26,116 --> 00:31:27,818
That's really
the problem here.

00:31:27,818 --> 00:31:29,820
You've -- you've --
it's impossible

00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,288
to give you $250,000 for --

00:31:31,288 --> 00:31:32,890
I'd have to own
the whole company.

00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:35,192
I'm sorry, but I'm out.

00:31:35,192 --> 00:31:37,094
Okay.
CUBAN: Good luck, guys.

00:31:37,094 --> 00:31:39,029
Thank you, Bob.
Thanks, Chase.

00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:40,062
Thanks, guys.
Thank you.
GREINER: Good luck, guys.

00:31:40,062 --> 00:31:42,031
All the best.
Thank you.

00:31:43,266 --> 00:31:45,501
Kevin,
we're all friends here.

00:31:45,501 --> 00:31:46,736
Yes.
We love you.

00:31:46,736 --> 00:31:47,970
Yes.
You have a problem.

00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,305
[ laughter ]

00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,682
NARRATOR:
Next up is a product

00:32:00,682 --> 00:32:05,020
designed to unleash a child's
creativity and imagination.

00:32:11,326 --> 00:32:12,794
Hello, sharks.

00:32:12,794 --> 00:32:17,631
My name is Erika Pope,
and my company is Fort Magic.

00:32:17,631 --> 00:32:21,302
I am here seeking
a $75,000 investment

00:32:21,302 --> 00:32:24,672
in exchange for 15%
of my company.

00:32:24,672 --> 00:32:29,610
Remember being a kid and how
much fun it was to build forts

00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:32,346
when you wanted to bring your
greatest fantasies to life,

00:32:32,346 --> 00:32:35,448
but the frustration you had
that all you had to work with

00:32:35,448 --> 00:32:38,318
was couch cushions
that would fall apart

00:32:38,318 --> 00:32:41,254
or a card table that looked
nothing like your imagination?

00:32:41,254 --> 00:32:43,122
Well, enter Fort Magic,

00:32:43,122 --> 00:32:47,527
where a child can build a fort
as big as their imagination.

00:32:48,828 --> 00:32:51,030
The magic of our Fort Magic kit

00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,831
is in the large number
and variety

00:32:52,831 --> 00:32:56,034
of sticks and connectors
included in every kit.

00:32:56,034 --> 00:32:58,370
With just one Fort Magic kit,

00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:01,273
a child can build
unlimited fort designs.

00:33:01,273 --> 00:33:03,242
They can build a castle fort.

00:33:03,242 --> 00:33:06,144
They could build a pirate ship.

00:33:06,144 --> 00:33:08,146
Or they could build a racecar.

00:33:08,146 --> 00:33:10,748
Who's ready to come aboard
a company that has a product

00:33:10,748 --> 00:33:13,484
that has been repeatedly called

00:33:13,484 --> 00:33:16,387
the best money spent
on a toy ever?

00:33:17,622 --> 00:33:21,259
Erika, you must have
very amazing numbers.

00:33:21,259 --> 00:33:22,727
Yes, it has been
amazingly received.

00:33:22,727 --> 00:33:24,428
You want to share those
with us?

00:33:24,428 --> 00:33:28,064
Sure. So, Fort Magic has been
open for 18 months.

00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:32,869
And in those 18 months,
we have made $150,000 in sales.

00:33:32,869 --> 00:33:34,371
O'LEARY:
Erika, how have you sold it?

00:33:34,371 --> 00:33:36,673
You've done it online?
Have you worked with retailers?

00:33:36,673 --> 00:33:39,809
We sell almost entirely through
Amazon, as a matter of fact.

00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,746
HERJAVEC: Erika, tell me
a little bit about the product.

00:33:42,746 --> 00:33:44,347
You mention one kit
can do multiple things.

00:33:44,347 --> 00:33:45,614
Did I understand
that correctly?

00:33:45,614 --> 00:33:47,549
That is correct.
How big is that kit?

00:33:47,549 --> 00:33:51,887
So, each kit comes
with all of these pieces.

00:33:51,887 --> 00:33:54,990
There are 384 pieces
in a kit.

00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:56,959
When you receive
the retail box,

00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:59,261
it's 26 inches by 10 inches
by 10 inches.

00:33:59,261 --> 00:34:00,396
Oh, wow. That's big.

00:34:00,396 --> 00:34:02,731
Yes, but every
Fort Magic kit comes

00:34:02,731 --> 00:34:04,699
with a very high quality,
excellent storage bag.

00:34:04,699 --> 00:34:07,635
That's gonna be difficult
to get into retail ever.

00:34:07,635 --> 00:34:09,404
That's a very large footprint.

00:34:10,938 --> 00:34:12,473
What's the unique part
of the connectors?

00:34:12,473 --> 00:34:15,943
Have you -- is -- is the way
that they connect unique?

00:34:15,943 --> 00:34:19,647
Like, when I put it together,
is it -- is it hard?

00:34:19,647 --> 00:34:21,214
Like, how do I --
oh, I have test samples.

00:34:21,214 --> 00:34:22,616
Would you like to try some?

00:34:22,616 --> 00:34:23,483
Yes.
Sure.

00:34:25,686 --> 00:34:28,488
Here, everyone.
Here's some pieces.

00:34:28,488 --> 00:34:31,224
HERJAVEC: It's actually
really well made.

00:34:31,224 --> 00:34:32,893
Like, it's a lot sturdier
than I would have thought.

00:34:32,893 --> 00:34:35,729
It's very sturdy.

00:34:35,729 --> 00:34:37,397
This can't be patentable,
is it?

00:34:37,397 --> 00:34:39,298
POPE: Actually,
we are patent-pending.

00:34:39,298 --> 00:34:42,168
O'LEARY: So, tell me
about the numbers.

00:34:42,168 --> 00:34:43,936
Tell us what it costs,
what it costs to make,
who's making it for you.

00:34:43,936 --> 00:34:46,706
Sure.
Is it built in America
or offshore?

00:34:46,706 --> 00:34:48,474
Okay.
What are your margins,
all that good stuff?

00:34:48,474 --> 00:34:50,576
That's a lot of questions
at once. Oh, my gosh.
It's all one question.

00:34:50,576 --> 00:34:52,678
No problem. I'll answer
all of them, no problem.

00:34:52,678 --> 00:34:54,980
Well, because I want
to know about money.
Sure, of course.

00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:57,049
We all want to know about money
when it comes to business,

00:34:57,049 --> 00:34:59,084
so no problem.

00:34:59,084 --> 00:35:01,252
I just want to bring
to your attention, by the way,

00:35:01,252 --> 00:35:03,188
this is our teepee,
and simultaneous to the teepee,

00:35:03,188 --> 00:35:04,656
you can make
your stick buddy horse.

00:35:04,656 --> 00:35:06,191
So, just pointing that
out to you.

00:35:07,325 --> 00:35:09,461
[ laughs ]

00:35:09,461 --> 00:35:11,229
What's your background?
How did you come up with this?

00:35:11,229 --> 00:35:13,131
I was a stay-at-home mom
for 15 years,

00:35:13,131 --> 00:35:14,933
and I love being
a stay-at-home mom,

00:35:14,933 --> 00:35:16,667
and I, you know, love
my children.

00:35:16,667 --> 00:35:18,569
My son was playing
with his dryer box

00:35:18,569 --> 00:35:20,137
that was falling apart.

00:35:20,137 --> 00:35:23,741
I just thought, "You know,
we can do better than this."

00:35:23,741 --> 00:35:25,376
And then we started playing
with the idea.

00:35:25,376 --> 00:35:27,811
And we actually --
we had to invent the
way to bend our sticks.

00:35:27,811 --> 00:35:30,881
When I started playing with it,
it was so much fun.

00:35:30,881 --> 00:35:33,016
And then when we covered it,
it was,

00:35:33,016 --> 00:35:34,350
"Oh, it's so adorable.
It's so cute."

00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:37,220
Back to the numbers.
back to the numbers.

00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,322
Well, but the thing is,
before the numbers...
O'LEARY: Okay, please.

00:35:39,322 --> 00:35:41,290
Let me ask you --
wait, wait, wait.
Before I die of old age,

00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:43,926
tell me what these sell for
and how much you make.
let me ask you
one thing, though.

00:35:43,926 --> 00:35:45,528
None of the fabric
comes with, though.

00:35:45,528 --> 00:35:47,497
That you have to do
yourself.
That is correct.

00:35:47,497 --> 00:35:48,965
Which fabric?
All the fabrics on these.

00:35:48,965 --> 00:35:50,366
Any of the fabric.

00:35:50,366 --> 00:35:51,400
Does it come with a mom

00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,802
to make the fabrics
to cover the shell?

00:35:55,771 --> 00:35:57,739
So, tell me
about the numbers.

00:35:57,739 --> 00:36:01,042
Um, our -- not deviating
from the numbers on purpose.

00:36:01,042 --> 00:36:02,377
I think you are.

00:36:03,779 --> 00:36:08,450
Okay, great. So, our Fort Magic
kit sells for $199.

00:36:09,617 --> 00:36:12,319
Whoa. Ain't cheap.

00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:15,823
We currently manufacture the
Fort Magic kit for $40 a kit.

00:36:15,823 --> 00:36:19,593
And we can get it
to the end user for $50 a kit.

00:36:19,593 --> 00:36:21,862
So our margins are 75%.

00:36:21,862 --> 00:36:27,567
We profit approximately,
well, $100 per kit.

00:36:27,567 --> 00:36:30,036
How much money have you put
into this?

00:36:30,036 --> 00:36:33,773
So, I have invested $50,000.

00:36:33,773 --> 00:36:35,542
Um, my mother has invested
$200,000.

00:36:35,542 --> 00:36:37,110
Ohh!
$200,000?!

00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,244
Yes, $200,000.

00:36:38,244 --> 00:36:39,579
Whoa, mommy dearest.

00:36:41,114 --> 00:36:42,816
How much does mommy own
of the company?

00:36:42,816 --> 00:36:45,818
So, the original split
is 50/50,

00:36:45,818 --> 00:36:48,120
but we recently brought in
another investor.

00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,957
He's actually committed
$200,000 at 35%.

00:36:51,957 --> 00:36:53,826
What does that do
to the equity breakdown?

00:36:53,826 --> 00:36:54,960
'cause he's gonna get 35%,

00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,328
you and your mom
were 50/50.

00:36:56,328 --> 00:36:58,230
Yes.
Right?
Who takes the hit?

00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:00,466
Is it just equally,
so now you're all...
Equally.

00:37:00,466 --> 00:37:02,267
...Basically third, third,
third partners.

00:37:02,267 --> 00:37:03,734
Well, essentially, yes.

00:37:03,734 --> 00:37:06,370
But I have complete authority
to negotiate here today.

00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:09,273
Erika, let me say, I think
your enthusiasm is delicious.

00:37:09,273 --> 00:37:10,308
Thank you.

00:37:10,308 --> 00:37:11,976
You're bubbling over,
but let me tell you,

00:37:11,976 --> 00:37:14,879
your answers to the questions
are driving me nuts.

00:37:14,879 --> 00:37:15,780
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,849
Yeah.
You're all over the place.

00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:19,350
I feel like you don't know
what you're shooting at.

00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:20,418
Let me give you one shot
at that.

00:37:20,418 --> 00:37:21,618
Okay, yes.

00:37:21,618 --> 00:37:23,253
If I said to you, what are
your top three priorities,

00:37:23,253 --> 00:37:24,788
starting tomorrow morning
when you go to work,

00:37:24,788 --> 00:37:25,789
what would they be?

00:37:25,789 --> 00:37:29,159
Um...Sorry,
I'm quite caught off guard.

00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:30,760
Top three priorities.

00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,264
Well, immediately
or in general? I'm sorry.

00:37:34,264 --> 00:37:36,299
Immediate --
the next day,
the next week.

00:37:36,299 --> 00:37:37,934
You're making her point.
You realize that.

00:37:37,934 --> 00:37:38,969
[ chuckles ]
Well, I'm sorry.

00:37:38,969 --> 00:37:41,837
Okay, I've never seen
an entrepreneur

00:37:41,837 --> 00:37:43,572
ever in my life succeed

00:37:43,572 --> 00:37:45,808
without being
hyper-focused

00:37:45,808 --> 00:37:47,843
on exactly
what's most important.

00:37:47,843 --> 00:37:51,013
For me, it certainly
wouldn't be a good fit,

00:37:51,013 --> 00:37:52,915
and I'm sad to say
I'm out.

00:37:52,915 --> 00:37:54,817
Well, I-I don't know
what to say

00:37:54,817 --> 00:37:57,652
except other than I definitely
believe in Fort Magic.

00:37:57,652 --> 00:38:00,388
Erika, you're going
200 miles an hour,

00:38:00,388 --> 00:38:02,624
and I don't know what direction
you're going in.

00:38:02,624 --> 00:38:05,093
I don't think you know what
direction you're going in.

00:38:05,093 --> 00:38:06,861
I don't think
you're focused enough.

00:38:06,861 --> 00:38:08,363
And for that reason,
I'm out.

00:38:08,363 --> 00:38:10,932
Okay.
Well, thank you.

00:38:10,932 --> 00:38:13,001
Erika, most families
in America

00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:15,836
can't pay $199
for a child's toy.

00:38:15,836 --> 00:38:17,304
They just can't.

00:38:17,304 --> 00:38:20,974
I mean, that is really high
in the children's toy business.

00:38:20,974 --> 00:38:23,911
If you want this to be big,
it has to be for under $100.

00:38:23,911 --> 00:38:26,813
I'm out.

00:38:26,813 --> 00:38:28,682
Okay. Thanks, Kevin.

00:38:30,384 --> 00:38:32,719
Okay. Robert and Lori?
[ chuckles ]

00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,187
I agree with Kevin.

00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:39,292
I think that it's expensive
for what it is

00:38:39,292 --> 00:38:41,694
and that you don't get
everything to put it together.

00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,563
If it came at $199

00:38:43,563 --> 00:38:44,764
with all of the fabric

00:38:44,764 --> 00:38:47,099
and everything
that you have in front of us,

00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:50,570
then that would be, to me,
a great price.

00:38:52,671 --> 00:38:55,340
And for that reason,
I'm out.

00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,575
Thanks, Lori.

00:38:57,976 --> 00:38:59,911
HERJAVEC: You know,
one of the things

00:38:59,911 --> 00:39:02,581
I've learned on "Shark Tank"
after five seasons

00:39:02,581 --> 00:39:05,450
is there are some products
that when people come on,

00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:07,586
the audience
is gonna buy in droves.

00:39:07,586 --> 00:39:11,288
I think you're gonna sell
a ton of forts.

00:39:11,288 --> 00:39:13,691
Are you making
an offer?

00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,736
NARRATOR:
Four sharks are out.

00:39:25,736 --> 00:39:29,606
Erika only has one chance
to make a deal.

00:39:29,606 --> 00:39:32,442
I think you're gonna sell
a ton of forts.

00:39:32,442 --> 00:39:34,410
O'LEARY: Are you making
an offer?

00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:35,612
I am making an offer.

00:39:35,612 --> 00:39:38,781
My challenge
is keeping you focused.

00:39:38,781 --> 00:39:41,250
For me to be involved
with the business,

00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:43,519
I would need to be
an equal partner with you.

00:39:44,854 --> 00:39:47,022
$75,000 for 50%.

00:39:48,123 --> 00:39:50,292
Okay, thank you, Robert.

00:39:51,693 --> 00:39:52,728
Let me ask you this,
Robert.

00:39:52,728 --> 00:39:53,962
For 50%, can you tell me

00:39:53,962 --> 00:39:56,765
exactly what you think
that you'll be bringing

00:39:56,765 --> 00:39:59,001
in terms of, like, moving
our distribution

00:39:59,001 --> 00:40:01,436
and moving our sales for us
this year and in the future?

00:40:01,436 --> 00:40:03,371
That's the smartest question
you've asked so far.

00:40:03,371 --> 00:40:04,939
No, Erika,
that is a great question.

00:40:04,939 --> 00:40:07,541
There's a bunch of things
that I think

00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:09,777
my team and I
can help you focus on.

00:40:09,777 --> 00:40:12,847
You got to sell the materials
with it and stuff like that.

00:40:12,847 --> 00:40:14,415
Which will add cost.
So I think you could --

00:40:14,415 --> 00:40:16,651
it will add cost, but I think
that's an option for people.

00:40:16,651 --> 00:40:18,219
I would take it
to retail,

00:40:18,219 --> 00:40:20,154
but I'd have
to see the packaging.

00:40:20,154 --> 00:40:21,421
I just keep going back to,

00:40:21,421 --> 00:40:23,423
I think you're gonna sell
a lot of forts.

00:40:27,327 --> 00:40:31,464
50% is too much, unfortunately.
It's too much.

00:40:31,464 --> 00:40:33,867
And I understand that, um --

00:40:33,867 --> 00:40:36,836
O'LEARY: What would you sell
for $75,000,

00:40:36,836 --> 00:40:39,471
given that he's made you
an offer, and that's
an achievement here?

00:40:39,471 --> 00:40:42,408
Many people come on
"Shark Tank" with toys.
Very few get offers.

00:40:42,408 --> 00:40:44,476
He's reflecting
the challenges ahead

00:40:44,476 --> 00:40:46,612
in his risk profile
of your business,

00:40:46,612 --> 00:40:48,080
and he wants to be paid
for the risk.

00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,417
And you haven't done a really
good job in de-risking it,

00:40:51,417 --> 00:40:53,052
because, as Barbara said,

00:40:53,052 --> 00:40:55,087
you're scatterbrained,
you know?

00:40:55,087 --> 00:40:56,889
No, no.
No.

00:40:56,889 --> 00:40:58,956
CORCORAN: I didn't say
exactly that.
Okay. Mr. Wonderful,
I am not scatterbrained.

00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:01,793
Hey, I'm just --
that's right.
You tell him.

00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,628
I may be enthusiastic,
but I am actually very driven

00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,329
and very hard-working,
and I have brought us this far.

00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:06,531
Okay, then get focused
on the offer.

00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:10,134
I don't know that
you're gonna like it, Robert,

00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:13,705
but honestly, I was thinking
more something like 25%.

00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:18,008
I'm not gonna change
from that.

00:41:21,478 --> 00:41:24,881
I really appreciate it,
but I'm gonna have to say no.

00:41:24,881 --> 00:41:26,083
CORCORAN: Good for you.
CUBAN: Good for you.

00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:27,084
GREINER: Good for you,
and you'll make it.

00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:28,552
Yeah.

00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:30,387
Everybody's clapping.
They didn't make you an offer.

00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:32,889
Oh, that wasn't a real offer,
Robert, and you know it.

00:41:32,889 --> 00:41:35,024
Okay, how --
you -- you did not expect her
to take it, and you know it.

00:41:35,024 --> 00:41:36,625
How do I deal with all
the other partners, Mark?

00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:38,160
How do I deal
with the other partners?

00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,829
You did not -- you did not
expect her to take it.

00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:41,363
Just because she spent
$250,000 in the past

00:41:41,363 --> 00:41:42,898
doesn't change
where we are right now today.

00:41:42,898 --> 00:41:46,302
I'm just telling you it wasn't
a real offer, Robert.

00:41:46,302 --> 00:41:47,670
All right.
Thank you, everyone.

00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:48,904
I appreciate it.
Thank you.

00:41:48,904 --> 00:41:50,072
Good luck
with everything.

00:41:50,072 --> 00:41:51,306
I appreciate it.
Thank you.

00:41:53,708 --> 00:41:55,643
Ha to you, Robert.

00:41:55,643 --> 00:41:57,679
Look, Barbara,
I had the ability

00:41:57,679 --> 00:41:59,881
to make an offer
that works for me.

00:41:59,881 --> 00:42:01,249
O'LEARY: That business
is so screwed up.

00:42:01,249 --> 00:42:03,518
You can't sell
a lot of these at $200.

00:42:03,518 --> 00:42:04,719
Sure, you can.
That's ridiculous.

00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:06,688
Sure, you can.
I don't think so.

00:42:06,688 --> 00:42:08,656
For 200 bucks, that car should
have an engine in it.

00:42:08,656 --> 00:42:10,224
[ chuckles ]

00:42:10,224 --> 00:42:12,059
POPE: I'm actually
a very focused person.

00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:15,763
Even though I may not answer
every question immediately,

00:42:15,763 --> 00:42:18,132
that certainly doesn't take
anything away from the fact

00:42:18,132 --> 00:42:20,208
that I know exactly what we're
doing with Fort Magic.

00:42:20,208 --> 00:42:22,711
I know what our plan is. I know
where we are going forward.

00:42:22,711 --> 00:42:23,912
And I'm just really excited

00:42:23,912 --> 00:42:25,876
about the future
for our company.
