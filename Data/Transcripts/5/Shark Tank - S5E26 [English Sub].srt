00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:03,837
NARRATOR:
This is the Shark Tank,
where hopeful entrepreneurs

00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:06,607
get a once-in-a-lifetime chance
to pitch the sharks...

00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:08,108
My name
is moziah Bridges,

00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:10,177
and I am the C.E.O.
of Mo's Bows.

00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:12,145
...In hopes
of getting an investment

00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:15,115
to start, grow,
or save their businesses.

00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:17,417
Who would like to experience
the drink of the gods?

00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:18,652
Oh!
Ugh!

00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:19,987
People paid for this?

00:00:19,987 --> 00:00:22,155
NARRATOR: The entrepreneurs
must convince a shark

00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:24,124
to invest the full amount
they're asking for,

00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:26,260
or they'll walk away
with nothing.

00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,096
We're on track to do
$1.5 million in sales.

00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:33,133
I believe I am an n.B.T. --
The next big thing -- and --

00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:35,235
oh, my goodness. did you just
say "n.b.t. -- next big thing"?

00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:36,436
Yeah.

00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:38,472
NARRATOR: If the sharks
hear a great idea...

00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:39,940
I smell a royalty deal.

00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,943
NARRATOR: ...They're ready to
invest using their own money.

00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:44,745
And they're willing
to fight each other

00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:45,846
for a piece of the action.

00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:47,948
What are sales gonna be
this year?

00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:48,916
$4.2 million.

00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:50,784
I'll give you $1.5 million.

00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:52,920
I'd like to split it in the
middle and go $1.75 million.

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,354
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
HERJAVEC: Wow.
CORCORAN: Wow.

00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:56,557
Under what planet would that
make sense to an investor?

00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,693
I promise you, we will do a
minimum of $10 million in sales.

00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:00,761
What?

00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:02,095
Oh!
Oh!

00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:03,997
This is the shortest pitch
in "Shark Tank" history.

00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,768
NARRATOR:
Who are the sharks?

00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:12,339
They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors

00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:14,841
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.

00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:17,244
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist

00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,646
who turned a $10,000 loan

00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:23,584
into a software business
worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:28,655
Barbara Corcoran went
from waiting tables in Manhattan

00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:32,459
to building the city's
preeminent real-estate empire.

00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,928
Daymond John is
a fashion and branding expert

00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,964
who grew
his homemade clothing line

00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:40,200
into the globally recognized
fashion brand fubu,

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,503
with over $6 billion
in retail sales to date.

00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:46,707
Robert Herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,

00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:48,575
is now a technology mogul

00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:53,113
who sold his first internet
companies for over $350 million.

00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:55,482
And Mark Cuban,

00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,985
notorious billionaire
entrepreneur, tech guru,

00:01:57,985 --> 00:02:12,966
and the outspoken owner
of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.

00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,134
First into the tank

00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,637
is a reinvention
of an ancient beverage.

00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,948
Hello, sharks.
I'm Jon fotheringham.

00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,082
And I'm
Dr. Eric durtschi.

00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:30,651
We're the creators
of crio,

00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,352
and we're seeking
$1 million

00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:35,188
in exchange for a 10%
equity stake in our business.

00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:37,724
Imagine
if you could combine

00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:39,526
two of America's
biggest passions --

00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:40,761
coffee and chocolate --

00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:44,197
into one amazing new drink
and tap into the $75 billion

00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,366
coffee, tea,
and chocolate markets.

00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:48,769
For thousands of years,
the Maya of central America

00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:51,271
prepared a chocolaty drink
called xocoatl --

00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:52,673
the drink of the gods.

00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,007
After years
of experimenting,

00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,876
I reinvented
this delicious drink

00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:58,145
made with
100% cocoa beans.

00:02:58,145 --> 00:02:59,446
And it's
incredibly healthy.

00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:03,350
Crio has zero fat, zero sugar,
zero cholesterol,

00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,053
only 10 calories per cup,
and more antioxidants

00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:07,487
than pomegranate juice
or blueberries.

00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:10,957
It also contains a natural
stimulant called theobromine

00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:13,293
that gives you long-lasting,
gentle energy.

00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:16,563
So you can say goodbye
to the spike and crash

00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,532
of jittery energy
you get from coffee.

00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:22,235
In short, crio is cocoa
the way it was meant to be.

00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:25,439
Now, who would like
to experience the
drink of the gods?

00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,645
All right, sharks,
you're really in for a treat.

00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:34,614
For $1 million,
it better be a hell of a treat.

00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,049
DURTSCHI: We've got
a couple of things there.

00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,485
Crio can be brewed at home
or in coffee shops.

00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,687
Now, you can
have it plain.

00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,489
The one that you're
going to have that's iced

00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:43,790
is called iced coconut crio.

00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,659
This has a little bit of cream
added to it.

00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,033
Oh!

00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:54,768
Ugh!

00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:55,669
Ugh.

00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,241
Ugh, I don't like taste
of that.

00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:05,812
Not a fan, guys. I'm out.

00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,881
Not for me. I'm out.

00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:10,584
JOHN:
Yeah, it really is horrible.

00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:11,618
I'm out.

00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,923
Okay, so this is the shortest
pitch in "Shark Tank" history.

00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,725
I'm gonna let you
have a chance to explain

00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,994
why you're worth
$10 million.

00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:24,898
Well, this year, we're on track
to do $1.5 million in sales.

00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:28,835
We've sold over 276,000 units
over the past two years.

00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:32,739
We should be in 1,000 new stores
in the coming six months.

00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,741
We've done
hundreds of demos.

00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,543
I would say
that 9 out of the 10 people

00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:38,578
that try it in the store
like it.

00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:39,846
What do you think
about that?

00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,148
Hey, look,
just 'cause I don't like it

00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:42,682
doesn't mean there
aren't people who do like it.

00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,418
O'LEARY: Which one
of my assumptions is wrong?

00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:46,653
This is a commodity.

00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,889
Anybody can package this
and sell it.

00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,390
No one's ever heard of it,

00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,692
so you've got a marketing job
from hell.

00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:56,329
Why are you asking
for $1 million for 10%?

00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:59,399
How -- how -- under what
scenario on what planet

00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,801
would that make sense
to an investor?

00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:06,406
This is actually a
product that we've had
a lot of interest from

00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,074
from some
very large companies.

00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:11,344
I've actually found references
over 150 years old

00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,079
from people
who have tried to do this.

00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,682
And they've not been able
to do that for a few reasons.

00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:18,285
The roasting is something
that's completely different

00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:20,086
from what's done
with normal chocolate products

00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,254
as well
as coffee products.

00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:22,622
Oh, so you're telling me
the process

00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,724
by which you make your crio bean
is proprietary and unique?

00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:25,959
Absolutely.

00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,527
And that is something
we have patent pending.

00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,432
Who are you selling it to?
Through what medium?

00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,901
FOTHERINGHAM: 60% of our sales
are in grocery stores.

00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,469
We're in 500 stores
currently --

00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:39,139
on slate to be in 1,500 stores
by the end of the year.

00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,074
Do you have reorders
in this short period of time?

00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,142
Absolutely.

00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:43,743
And I know your experience
is different,

00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:44,978
but to be honest
with you,

00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:46,646
a lot of times,
people try it their first try,

00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:47,848
and you don't know
what to expect.

00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,416
You're either thinking
hot chocolate

00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,951
or you're thinking
coffee.

00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:52,185
This is neither one
of those.

00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,753
O'LEARY:
Why is that a good thing?

00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,655
You have to educate
an entire generation

00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:57,090
that they should be
drinking this,

00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,359
supposedly, because it's better
for them than coffee

00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,494
and that the taste is,
at least, equivalent.

00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:04,297
I mean, I can see people --
I think we have
five opinions here,

00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,632
and everybody thought
the taste --

00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:07,267
no, not me. I thought
the taste was fine.

00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:09,569
What you were expecting
was something that tasted
like coffee.

00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,204
No, that's not what
I was expecting at all.

00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,006
I was looking for
a coffee replacement,

00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:14,774
not knowing
what to expect.

00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:18,445
It just tastes like cocoa beans
mashed up, ripe,

00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:21,781
and hot water put
in, and there wasn't
enough cocoa put in.

00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:22,983
Well, Mark, they're --
they're selling $1.5 million.

00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:25,151
Some people like it.
So, here's the thing --

00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,921
how much you making
on the $1.5 million?

00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:30,257
This year,
we should do $150,000.

00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:32,559
So let's just
think about this.
That's awesome.
That's all that matters, right?

00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,896
You're asking me to pay
100 times your profit.

00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,798
Well, and so,
part of that is --

00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:41,234
I mean,
I have to punish you now.

00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,237
Why in the world
would you value yourself

00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,240
at such a number
that it is impossible --

00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,743
that's what they've been trying
to figure out for 150 years.

00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,913
[ laughter ]
Nobody would ever pay you
that valuation.

00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,548
You're not worth
100 times your profit.

00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,884
I think you're screwed.
I'm out.

00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,756
And then there
was Barbara.

00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,159
Barbara,
what are you gonna do?

00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,094
I think you're screwed.
I'm out.

00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,196
[ laughter ]
Oh, Barbara!

00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,432
I'm sorry.
That was so --
guys, we didn't mean
to be that mean. I mean --

00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,235
no, because the wrong
evaluation -- it's too
bad you did that.
yeah.

00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:16,836
Okay.
Yeah, I apologize for us --
the initial response.

00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,905
I didn't expect it.
All of us here tried
it, except for Kevin.

00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,340
What are you
apologizing for?

00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,975
Because we try to be very
supportive entrepreneurs.

00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:24,010
You guys --
how can you be
supportive of this? My God.

00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,146
No, somebody asks you for
a crazy number, and you
want to be supportive?

00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,214
You're en-- you're --
you're encouraging America
to come here and ask
for stupid valuations?

00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:30,317
All I can tell you is the first
615 times I drank beer,

00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:31,785
I thought
it tasted horrible, right?

00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,820
Nothing to do with the taste.
The valuation was insane.

00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,157
Yeah, but, Kevin, you're basing
on the value today. They're --

00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:38,525
oh, really?
I want to pay --

00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:40,226
and I -- and I promise you,
we really wanted a deal

00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,329
because you guys have so much
to bring to the table.

00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,797
But why do you -- why did you
price it that way?
But I promise you
that next year,

we will do a minimum
of $10 million in sales.

We hope you prove us wrong.

At rugged maniac,

00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,451
participants will climb over
towers of shipping containers,

of forest, fields, ski slopes,
and even motocross tracks.

In short, rugged maniac
strikes the perfect balance

00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,032
between fun
and physicality

00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,535

what we're all about,

I didn't even know
you existed,

00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,333

your competitor.

00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,868
You mean like

00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:03,036
How are you different
than that?

00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:04,971
We're -- we're different
in this sense.

00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,707
Basically, tough mudder
is a 12-mile course, right,

00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,109
with about 20 obstacles.

00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,277
We have 25 obstacles
over three miles.

00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,080
So it's more about the obstacles
and less about the running.

00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,682
And being
a three-mile course,

00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:17,050
it's much more accessible
to the general public

00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,085
than something like
a 12-mile course would be.

00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,087
Are you saying this
is a tamer version of that --

00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,889

an excellent balance

00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,406
between the workout
and the party.

00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:41,774
Because it's a shorter race,
it takes, you know,

00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,977
an average of an hour
or a little bit more to finish.

00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,679

00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,120
Mark, you said you were
interested. Would you --

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,555
CUBAN: No, I'm very --
I love the one business.

00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,624
I-if I didn't know
about this other business,

00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,726
I'd probably make an offer
right now, right?

00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,827
Sure.

00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,262
But I want to hear
what you say to rob.

00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:58,264
I think I know, but --
I think I'm giving you
a fair offer.

00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,299
I think the business is worth,
what, six times ebitda --

00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,001
1.5 times revenue,
roughly.

00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,903
Right.
And I'm pricing in.
I think that's generous.

00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,405
I'm pricing it in

00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,974
because I see the upside
in the other business.

00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:11,611
Okay.
Asking for $1 million
for this business

00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:12,678
was already challenging.

00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:14,680
Having another agenda

00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,516
and another business
on the other side,

00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:18,918
my gut feeling is and my
instinct is that no matter what,

00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,954
I would be screwed working
with you, I wouldn't trust you.

00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,489
I'm out.

00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,091
Okay.
Thank you for your
consideration.

00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,427
You know, a funny thing happened
to me watching you here today.

00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,096
You came out here, I thought,
"what good-looking guys.

00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,465
Man, they look the part.
What a great video."

00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:34,534
but then
somewhere along the way,

00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:36,102
the surprise of the bulls

00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,104
and, "Oh, yeah.
we'll wrap that into the deal."

00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,606
And I don't think maybe
you intended it that way,

00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,642
but for some reason,
you lost my trust.

00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:46,279
But either way, I'm out.

00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,382
Sorry to hear that, but we thank
you for your consideration.

00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:51,417
Well, guys, you have --
you have, uh, one --
we have an offer...

00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,219
You have an offer
on the table.

00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:55,154
...From -- yes, we --
yes, we do.
What are you gonna do?

00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:59,158
And that's an offer
that's...Lower than
what we had wanted, but --

00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,027
no, let me make you an offer
higher than what you want.

00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:02,161
Well, no, of course.
I get it.

00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:06,265
Anyone else want to throw
an offer in the ring?

00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:07,266
I'm still listening.

00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:09,435
Well, Mark,
your concern is

00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:12,405
that you -- you want us to focus
all our energies on one.
CUBAN: No, no, no.
it's not that.

00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:15,308
You came in, and you tried
to sell us one business,

00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,009
and you
separated the two.

00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:20,012
You're overvaluing the other
business, in my opinion.

00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:24,383
And if you have such a-a
high opinion of that business,

00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:27,119
that's probably where a lot
of your attention's going to be.

00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:29,655
And as an investor,
I don't think it's worth

00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,457
the -- the value
that you're assigning to it,

00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:34,527
because you've had one event
for $200,000.

00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:36,295
Because the --
Mark, are you saying
my value's too high?

00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,431
Yes.

00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,400
Wow. Now Mark's
making me nervous about,

00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,303
"am I overpaying?"

Two sharks are out.

Robert has made an offer,

00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:01,521
but Mark's concerns may
have caused a change of heart.

00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,389
Because the --
Mark, are you saying
my value's too high?

00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,258
Yes.

00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:07,727
Wow. Now Mark's
making me nervous about,

00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:09,328
"am I overpaying?"

00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:12,498
$1.5 million -- 25%.

00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,634
That gives you about
a $6 million value

00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,569
for the combined businesses.

00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,771
The longer we wait,

hang on, Robert.
you may want to hear this.

I think your offer
should be for 33% -- 1/3.

You because a third partner
with these guys.

00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:35,755

00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,124
Hmm.

00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:43,729
I'm good with that.
I like going up to 1/3.

00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:49,936
$1.5 million for 1/3
of the combined businesses.

00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:51,804
I'm with you, uncle Kevin.

00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,139
Yeah, I thought
you might be,

00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:55,341
because I think
you did overpay.
[ laughs ]

00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:56,842
rob, isn't it interesting
what's happened?

00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:59,679
You had an offer at here.

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,181
Now we're here.
Sure.

00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,116
The longer we stay here...

00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:10,289
So, what I would be
willing to do...

00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,725
Is $1.5 million,

00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:17,463
but it's for 25%
of the two companies combined.

00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,401
Okay.

00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:27,073
We're going to go discuss this,
consider both offers,

00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:28,441
and come back.

00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:42,321
I'm not sure what there is
to discuss, Mark.

00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:43,789
You made a better offer
than we did.

00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,725
Yeah, Mark made the same
as your initial.

00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:47,059
The challenge is,
when they come back,

00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,928
do you drop this dead weight
right here

00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:50,396
and go back
to your initial offer?

00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:51,931
Then you're overpaying.

00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:53,633
I don't think they're
gonna take either offer.

00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:54,967
Oh, I think they will.

00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,672
O'LEARY: Okay, gentlemen, let's
summarize what's happened here.

00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:01,607
You have two distinct offers.

00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:02,975
The first, from Mr. Cuban,

00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,544
is for $1.5 million
for 25% of your company.

00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:08,047
Which, by the way,
was the exact same offer I made,

00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:09,382
and he spent half an hour

00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:10,716
telling you how bad
your business is.

00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,084
I know, I know.

00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,987
O'LEARY: The other offer
is for the same amount of money

00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,889
for 33 1/3%
of your business.

00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:17,857
DICKENS: Mm-hmm.

00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:18,958
What are you going to do?

00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,662
We went out there
and discussed it.

00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,697
We'd -- we'd like to eventually
strike a deal with you.

00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:28,034
We wanted to come back in
and say,

00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:31,303
listen, we do $2 million
for -- for the 25%.

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,775
Instead of doing that,
we'd like to split it in the
middle and go $1.75 million.

00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,048
Deal.

00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:43,883
Deal? All right.

Go to work, baby.

Looking forward to it.
Looking forward to it.

00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,655
Looking forward to it.
Absolutely.
We'll make some money.

00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:51,323
Knew you'd lose out, but,
Robert, why did you do that?

00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,225
And thank you
for your considerations.

We are very excited.

We took that offer
from Mark

00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:01,500
because we realized that Mark
offers more than just money.

00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,537
Mark offers his experience,
he offers his connections.

00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,105

can come from it.

00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:08,140
Well done.
$1.75 million?

00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,542
For 25%.

00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,410
I'm actually surprised that
they came down in the valuation.

00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,445

00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:53,672
CORCORAN: [ laughs ]

00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:55,708
So, Cerebral Success contains
ginkgo biloba,

00:22:55,708 --> 00:23:00,112
schizandrol-a, omega 3 dha,
huperzine, vinpocetine,

00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:02,982
choline, and bacopa.

00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:04,917
Yeah, Kevin. Bacopa.

00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:06,418
But, sharks, pills?

00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:07,920
They're old-school.

00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,489
Introducing Cerebral Success
brain-boosting shots.

00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:12,725
These little shots
will contain the same

00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:15,027
tested and loved formula
as their older brother,

00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:16,662
while being the perfect
point-of-purchase item

00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:20,432
at every campus in every
bookstore nationwide.

00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:23,836
Sharks, I need your help
to make Cerebral Success

00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:25,304
a worldwide success.

00:23:25,304 --> 00:23:27,106
Can you show us all
a bottle?
Sure.

00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:29,541
So these are
just prototypes, so...

00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:30,776
There's nothing
in here, right?

00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:32,912
HERJAVEC: How did you
come up with it?

00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,347
So, I came up with it
while I was a college student.

00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:38,350
I, uh -- I always kind of fo--
struggled to focus, and, uh --

00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,785
no kidding.

00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:40,786
Really?

00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:42,254
[ chuckles ] Yep.

00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,557
And so, I-I was kind of mixing
my own different ingredients,

00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:48,627
different supplements,
for my own purpose, and --

00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:51,697
and so, is there any scientific
proof that this works?

00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:54,800
All of my ingredients have had
clinical studies done on them.

00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,937
No, I know, but the --
the combined product --
which means
absolutely nothing.

00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,673
Have you done any studies
or any tests

00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:03,042
that the combined product
works?

00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:07,046
We've had
over 60,000, um...

00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:09,281
Can't remember?
Can't remember?

00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,617
60-- 60,000 servings, sorry.
You're not doing yourself
any favors, Trevor.

00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:12,952
What were your sales
in the pills?

00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,186
So, we've sold 6--

00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:17,189
we-we've sold almost 900 bottles
in the pill form.

00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,124
Dollar-wise?
6-- about $60,000.

00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,093
You're selling those
for 70 bucks a pop?

00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:22,561
Yep.
Can I see that? That's --

00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:23,762
check this out.
so --

00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,331
what's your cost
on it?

00:24:25,331 --> 00:24:26,298
63 cents.

00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,599
Um, it's about --
it's about $10.

00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,868
We have really expensive
and high-quality ingredients.

00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,470
All the ingredients
listed there --

00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,604
O'LEARY:
Trevor, if I go into gnc

00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:35,407
and I go to the sector
that gives me supplements

00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:38,043
to enhance focus,
mental abilities,

00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:40,245
there's plenty
of offerings.

00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:41,647
Why are you
different?

00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:44,416
So, we're specifically designed
for college students.

00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:45,651
most brain sup--
what?

00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,052
How's that possible?

00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,320
So, most brain supplements

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,322
are more geared
towards elderly people.

00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,590
Like Barbara.

00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,825
[ laughs ]
Let me explain.

00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,093
Can I explain?
Can I explain?

00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:57,029
So, my product
has these four areas,

00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:59,665
whereas most --
most brain supplements,

00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,233
they only target
brain health.

00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,135
Mine throws in
the mental agility.

00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:04,737
Trevor, how do you
sell this today?

00:25:04,737 --> 00:25:06,705
You're at $60,000 in sales,
which, by the way --
all online.

00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,607
All online?
Yep.

00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:10,142
So, how do you know
it works?

00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:12,611
Reviews from our customers.
We've had --
that's it?

00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:15,647
So, we're averaging about
three bottles per customer.

00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,549
Customers keep buy--
coming back.

00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:20,586
So, if I buy this, how many
pills do I have to take?

00:25:20,586 --> 00:25:24,690
How long before
my memory improves or I get --

00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,393
immediately you feel the effect
and you do better on your test?

00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:29,762
So, it's -- it's designed
to feel in the short term

00:25:29,762 --> 00:25:32,164
and for, like, effects
in the long term.

00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:33,298
So if you take it once --

00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:34,867
say you're cramming
for a test --

00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:38,170
it'll help you recall more
information in the morning.

00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,738
If you take it
consistently,

00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:43,275
it'll have long-term benefits
for your memory,

00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:46,311
for your focus,
for your mental health.

00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:49,715
Look, you -- you can -- you can
convince anybody of anything

00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,283
for a short period of time.

00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:53,585
You don't --
you don't really believe

00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:56,588
that this is gonna lead
to Cerebral Success, do you?

00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:58,057
I-i really do believe it.

00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:59,191
I picked a collection

00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:01,160
of -- of --
of supplemental ingredients

00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,328
that I wanted in my product,
and then I had

00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:05,097
the professionals,
the manufacturers,

00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:07,299
the gmp-certified facilities
help me put it together,

00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:08,600
make sure it's all legit,

00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,403
make sure they -- they don't
interact with each other.

00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,439
But what about a kid
who's studying for an exam,

00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:15,574
he's a nervous wreck,
he's been drinking all night,

00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,142
and he takes 15, 20
of these pills?

00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:20,179
He'll have the dance
of the flaming sphincter.

00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:23,315
[ laughter ]
No, let me ask you,
though.
That's it.

00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:26,418
Now, what is the downside
to a substantial overdose?

00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,820
Just like
any other supplement,

00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,588
if -- if you're super-sensitive
to caffeine --

00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,156
JOHN: So, Trev, I don't want
to discredit you,

00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:33,358
and I know, you know,
you're a young entrepreneur,

00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:35,694
and you just want to get out
there and make some money

00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:37,229
and -- and -- and work
on your company,

00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:39,765
but you just don't have
any credibility in the market.

00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:40,899
I'm out.

00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:42,935
Okay.

00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,636
Yeah, Trevor,
I, you know --

00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:46,004
but they're all successful.

00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:47,739
This is a massive,
massive market, with --

00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,808
Trevor, just because
something's a-a massive market

00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:51,009
doesn't mean
that your --

00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:52,144
the demand's not there?

00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:53,512
No, no, no.
H-h-hey, Trevor, what?

00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:54,847
You're gonna stand there

00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:56,381
and you're gonna start telling
me about the business

00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:57,883
just because there's
a massive market?

00:26:57,883 --> 00:26:58,951
I was gonna tell you
about the demand.

00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,486
Focus used to be
a struggle for me.

00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:02,421
Hey, Trevor, anyb--
anybody can sell anything.

00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:03,989
I'm -- I'm not
a big believer in it.

00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:06,592
Let me paint one -- let me paint
one quick -- quick picture.

00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:08,694
Look, I -- before I forget,
I'm out.

00:27:08,694 --> 00:27:10,295
CORCORAN:
[ chuckles ]

00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,697
for those of you
who are still in,

00:27:11,697 --> 00:27:13,098
let me paint a picture
real quick.

00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:15,000
Imagine you're
a college student.

00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,369
Imagine you're going
to wherever they sell

00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:21,406
convenience items on campus,
and they see this product --

00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:24,443
something that says,
"boosts memory, boosts focus,

00:27:24,443 --> 00:27:28,514
boosts mental alertness,
and boosts brain health."

00:27:28,514 --> 00:27:30,983
whether -- whether you think my
credentials are there are not,

00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:33,185
do you think that they would buy
that product or not?

00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:34,153
JOHN:
That's not what we're saying.

00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:35,087
We're saying that
in our position,

00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:37,289
we just don't
necessarily feel

00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:40,692
that you have
the credibility to do that.

00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:41,960
I don't even think it's
about his credibility.

00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,530
This is about ethics
and integrity.

00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,131
Yes.

00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:48,467
Have you read
the warning on here?

00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:50,369
Yes. I mean, I've writ--
I wr-- I wrote the warning.

00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:52,137
"before taking, consult
a health-care professional

00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:53,639
"prior to consumption.

00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:56,975
"or if you have any pre-existing
medical conditions

00:27:56,975 --> 00:28:00,846
or any prescription medications,
do not use this product."

00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:02,114
I mean, you're not --
that's on --

00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:03,148
but that's on everything.
but why am I saying that?

00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:04,750
No, that's just
to protect myself.

00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,018
That's just to protect
myself from --
JOHN: It's all about ethics.

00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,319
We care about ethics here.

00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,454
And if you really want to deal
with a shark without ethics,

00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:12,124
then why don't you
just talk to Kevin?
[ laughter ]

00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:14,927
look, I-I mean, I feel like
I'm a very ethical person.

00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:17,496
I would never want to, you know,
mislead anybody.

00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:19,898
Look, I --
Trevor, you know what I hated
most about your presentation?

00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:22,467
What's that?
There's good money, and then
there's dirty money.

00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:25,437
I hated your example
where you said

00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:26,972
a college student
who didn't have enough sleep --

00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:30,742
would they shell out money
for something like this?

00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:32,744
And I'm amazed
that you're making

00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:35,414
a conscious decision
to go after this kind of money.

00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:38,450
There's a lot of ways
to be successful in life.

00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,352
Why take this path?

00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:41,520
Because I believe in it.

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,255
I mean, I've used it,
and it works.

00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:45,257
And I've had customer
who have used it --

00:28:45,257 --> 00:28:47,726
hallelujah. this is America.
do anything to make a buck.

00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:48,927
I'm kind of confused
on why you guys

00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,095
are painting this
as a -- as super-unethical --

00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:51,797
O'LEARY: I am not --
I'm trying to figure out,

00:28:51,797 --> 00:28:54,866
can I make a return in
the supplemental market
with your strategy?

00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:58,437
But you haven't articulated one.
I'm out.

00:28:58,437 --> 00:29:00,205
Thank you.

00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:03,609
CUBAN: Look, if you had
come in here and said,

00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:05,244
"I want to do
a controlled test.

00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,613
"I so believe at this
that I want to be able

00:29:07,613 --> 00:29:09,648
to demonstrate
that this works."

00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:11,783
that's not what you
came in to do.

00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:13,151
You -- you got a good marketing
pitch, you got big margins,

00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:14,586
and so, you can --
you can just do it,

00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,556
and that's what much of
the supplement business
is all about.

00:29:17,556 --> 00:29:19,458
Not for me. I'm out.

00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:21,293
Thank you.

00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:26,565
Barbara?
What are your thoughts?

00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:29,101
Um, I happen to have
a lot of close experience

00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,270
with people
who can't hold attention.

00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:35,240
One is my husband, bill,
who's a super-high-I.Q. Guy

00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,276
and has been on Adderall
his entire life.

00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:40,479
He orders anything
and everything

00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:43,782
and tries everything out so
that he doesn't take Adderall.

00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,652
And certain things work,
and then he's functional.

00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:48,253
Another experience --

00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:51,056
my kid went to a high-pressure
ivy league college,

00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:53,125
and he tells me that kids

00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:56,061
trade a-adderall
faster than beer.

00:29:56,061 --> 00:29:58,330
It's the drug of choice,
so there is a real need

00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:01,400
for kids to have something
to help them concentrate.

00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,902
But here's the thing --

00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:05,637
I'm concerned
about the liability.

00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,339
If you would do
a contingent deal

00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:09,241
where I have to get some kind
of liability coverage --

00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:10,742
[ groaning ]

00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,511
I don't need
your help here, Mark.

00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:15,714
So if you'd be willing to
make a small contingency
on that deal --

00:30:15,714 --> 00:30:18,350
so, Barbara, no matter
what chemical

00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,052
or anything he puts in there
that may kill somebody...
no, I read the chemicals.

00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:21,153
...As long as you're insured

00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:22,587
if he kills somebody,
you're fine.

00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:24,756
Let me tell you. Anything
wrongly taken can kill somebody.

00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:26,024
Just insurance
if somebody dies.

00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:27,292
You know what?
I'm gonna take a shot at it.

00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:28,593
What is your offer?

00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:33,098
My offer is $75,000
with that contingency for 40%.

00:30:33,098 --> 00:30:34,933
Oh, Barbara. Barbara.

00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:39,438
So, she has actually cut
your valuation in half --

00:30:39,438 --> 00:30:41,206
offered you $75,000 --

00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:42,808
no, he's not asking
for an interpreter,
thank you very much.

00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:44,443
What do you think?
You're making me ill.

00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:46,178
I'm very aware
of the valuation.
You're making me ill,
Barbara.

00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,546
I can't believe you made
an offer on that.
You're making my ill,
Barbara.

00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:49,648
I'm absolutely willing
to -- to do

00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:51,616
the -- the liability
insurance.

00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:56,054
And if you'd go down to 37%,
I'd be happy to take your deal.

00:30:57,556 --> 00:30:59,057
[ groans ]

00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:01,560
No. 40%.

00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,428
40% -- you got a deal.
Let's do it.
CORCORAN:
You got it, baby.

00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:06,498
They're making you out like
you're a thief in the night.

00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:08,367
I thank you.
Appreciate it.
Yeah.

00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:09,968
We'll do great.
He's not so bad.

00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:10,969
You guys are welcome
to try it.

00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:11,937
If I leave some,
would you --

00:31:11,937 --> 00:31:13,271
would you be willing
to try it?

00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:14,773
No.
No, they're
too close-minded.

00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:16,742
All right, well, thanks, guys.
Appreciate it.

00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:18,977
O'LEARY:
I did not see that coming.
You know I hate that.

00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:20,579
Yeah, of course you hate it.
I don't care if you --

00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:21,713
no, no.
you know why I hate it?

00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,148
'cause I have a lot
of respect for you.

00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:25,083
And by you investing in that,
you're giving credibility to it.

00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:28,653
Listen, when my husband's taking
supplemental nutrients,

00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:30,188
he functions better.

00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:32,290
HILTBRAND: So, to
the four sharks that thought

00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,925
that I was just selling
snake oil,

00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:35,193
all I say is try my product.

00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:37,362
If you still don't feel it,
then fine.

00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:39,965
But just try it
before you knock it.

00:31:47,506 --> 00:31:50,876
Do you like more patterns,
or do you like more solids?

00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:54,279
My name is moziah Bridges.
And I'm Mo's mom, tramica.

00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,214
And we live
in Memphis, Tennessee.

00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:57,783
These are
some nice suits.

00:31:57,783 --> 00:31:59,084
Fashion!

00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,252
It just speaks to me,

00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:02,721
and I like to look good,
and I like to feel good.

00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:04,556
Mo's always been
a snappy dresser.

00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:06,958
Even when he was 4 and I allowed
him to dress himself...

00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,193
Looking good.

00:32:08,193 --> 00:32:11,496
...He would choose to ride
his bike in a suit and tie.

00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:15,967
You're doing
a great job.

00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:18,603
BRIDGES: My grandmother was
a seamstress for a long time.

00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,871
She taught me how to sew,
and after that,

00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:23,208
my wardrobe got
a major upgrade.

00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:26,011
I love fashion so much,

00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:28,980
I decided to turn my passion
into a business.

00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,483
It's a high-end
fashion accessory

00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:33,852
that will have you
smiling and styling.

00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:35,554
We could put these
on our website.

00:32:35,554 --> 00:32:37,189
My fashion idol
is Daymond John,

00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:39,157
and when I grow up,
I want to be just like him.

00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:43,061
I need an investment from the
sharks to hire manufacturers.

00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:44,796
My strongest suit
is designing,

00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:48,233
and I need a team to bounce
my fresh ideas off of.

00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:51,136
If I don't get a deal from
the sharks, I'll be very sad.

00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:53,305
I need
to keep this dream alive,

00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:56,074
because my passion
is your fashion.

00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:17,729
Hello.

00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:19,264
My name
is moziah Bridges,

00:33:19,264 --> 00:33:22,434
and I am the C.E.O.
of Mo's Bows handmade bow ties.

00:33:22,434 --> 00:33:25,971
And I brought with me
my lovely mom-ager.

00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:27,506
Hi, sharks.
I'm tramica morris.

00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,574
And we're here today
seeking $50,000

00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:31,610
in exchange
for 20% of our company.

00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:37,382
Sharks, I always -- I mean,
always -- like to dress nice.

00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:39,451
Even when I was little,
I would wear a suit and tie

00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:41,219
just to go play
on the playground.

00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:45,156
But the problem was, I couldn't
find any bow ties that I liked,

00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:49,361
so my grandma,
she showed me how to sew,

00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,596
and then Mo's Bows
became.

00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:53,265
Now, we've actually
brought y'all

00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:56,301
some amazing bow ties
to have, feel, and see

00:33:56,301 --> 00:33:58,670
the quality of product
we offer.

00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,639
Bow ties are classic,
but Mo's Bows bow ties...

00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:03,475
Thank you.
...We like to call them
classic swag.

00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:05,410
But by investing
in Mo's Bows today

00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,379
means investing
in the future,

00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,681
because we don't
just make bow ties.

00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:11,449
Mo's story has inspired
people young and old

00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,517
to tap into their passion.

00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:15,287
Yes, I give everyone
the same advice --

00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:16,655
figure out
what you like doing,

00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:18,523
and find out how you can make
money doing it.

00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:22,594
Figure out, find out.
Figure out, find out.
It's that simple.

00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:26,197
Sharks, I know that, together,
we can make a lot of money

00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:28,800
and make this business
really, really successful

00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,437
by helping people look good
and feel good in my bow ties.

00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:35,774
So, I only just have
one question --

00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:37,909
who's coming with me?

00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,046
[ laughs ]
You're so charming.

00:34:41,046 --> 00:34:42,213
Thank you.

00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:44,215
Are you selling
any of these bow ties, mo?

00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:45,517
Yes.

00:34:45,517 --> 00:34:49,654
How many and to who?
I've sold, uh, 2,000.

00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:51,656
2,000? Wow.
Wow.
Wow.

00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:53,391
Did you hand-make
2,000 bow ties?

00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:54,960
Yes. Me and my grandma.
Yourself?

00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,128
But you're doing it all
in your house right now?
Yeah.

00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:59,564
You're running
a sweatshop.
Yes.

00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:00,999
[ laughter ]
How old are you, mo?

00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:02,634
I'm 11 years old.
Wow.

00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:04,636
How long did it take you
to sell the 2,000?

00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:05,837
We've been in business
for two years.

00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:07,038
mo started when he was 9.

00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:10,342
This year, we've sold
a total of 1,500 ties,

00:35:10,342 --> 00:35:12,978
at a total of $55,000
in selling ties.

00:35:12,978 --> 00:35:14,946
$55,000? mo.
Wow.

00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,514
CORCORAN: Who are you
selling them to?

00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:17,749
We sell online,

00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:20,685
and we have 11 different stores
across the South.

00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:23,054
How do people
find you, mo?

00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:26,291
They find me
from different trunk shows.

00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:29,127
My mom posted it
on Facebook and magazines.

00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,429
I've been in
  the Oprah magazine.

00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:34,232
moRRIS: So he's gotten
a lot of publicity.
Wow.

00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:35,367
How much does it cost you
to make one,

00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:36,434
and how much
do you sell it for?

00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:40,639
What it costs for me
to make one is $6 to $10,

00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,575
and they range
from $45 to $55.

00:35:43,575 --> 00:35:46,945
mo, why did you decide
on bow ties?

00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:48,647
Because I really like
to dress up,

00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:50,715
and, also,
my dad and my granddad,

00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:52,550
they were
really dapper men.

00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,785
[ laughs ]

00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:55,587
And bow ties make you look good
and feel good.

00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:58,823
I feel like I'm watching,
standing right before me,

00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,292
Daymond John working with his
mother, making his clothes...
you know, baby D.J.

00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:02,560
BRIDGES: Maybe.

00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,496
...His first hats
in the kitchen.
HERJAVEC: Oh.

00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:07,298
What do you think, Daymond?
Is that your new protégé?

00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:08,233
It could be.

00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:10,035
I'm you in 30 years.

00:36:10,035 --> 00:36:11,603
I wasn't doing that type
of business

00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:13,038
at that age,
so congratulations.

00:36:13,038 --> 00:36:15,774
What do you need
the $50,000 for?

00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:17,942
We want to use
the $50,000

00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:20,278
to go home and, um,
secure a manufacturer.

00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:23,014
Do you anticipate a large
amount of orders, or are
you saying

00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,382
that you already have orders

00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:27,018
and you want to take the money
to utilize it for that?

00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,220
Absolutely, both. We, uh,
currently have 11 stores.

00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,890
We have about five more stores
that are waiting.

00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:35,060
Any big-box players? Any large
fashion players interested?

00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:38,296
Right now, he's reached out
to Macy's and Dillard's

00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:39,931
and some
of the big-box players,

00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:42,167
but right now it's
in specialty boutiques
throughout the South.

00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:43,435
I'm gonna make
the assumption

00:36:43,435 --> 00:36:44,602
that you're trying to build
a brand -- Mo's Bows.

00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:45,904
I get it...
Mm-hmm.

00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:47,205
...Because these
are expensive.

00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,440
This is not
a cheap bow tie.

00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,141
CUBAN: mo,
you're teaching Kevin

00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:53,545
a very valuable lesson
in pricing elasticity.

00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:56,081
Do you know what pricing
elasticity is?
No.

00:36:56,081 --> 00:36:58,049
What that means is,
when you have more demand

00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,985
than you can supply,
what do you do?

00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:03,755
You raise your prices.

00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:05,056
When you go
to manufacturing,

00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:09,527
do you not lose a certain amount
of cache around it?

00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:12,063
Because today,
it's handcrafted Mo's Bows.

00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,898
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:17,635
If you have it manufactured,
is it still handcrafted?

00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:19,104
I believe so.

00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:21,639
Well, the -- the company that
we're working with in Memphis,

00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:24,109
it's a lady that used to own
a sewing factory.

00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:25,610
They're sewing,
they're cutting, so...

00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,779
I see. And how many
can they make a day?

00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:29,147
At least 500 a week.

00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:31,549
What will your grandmother say,
mo, when you fire her?

00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:32,717
Will she be upset?

00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:34,319
Well, my grandma,
she's just funny.

00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:36,254
She's just, "oh, okay."
CORCORAN: [ laughs ]

00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,689
yeah, she's --
she's --

00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:39,491
at 80 years old,
she's fine...
chill. everything.

00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:40,859
...With pretty much
whatever we --

00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:42,894
you're making an 80-year-old
woman work 10 hours a day?

00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:44,763
[ laughter ]

00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:46,097
Well, she loves me.

00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,699
She loves the feel
of my cheeks the most.

00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:49,267
JOHN:
mo, mo, are you gonna --

00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,136
are you planning
on expanding the line

00:37:51,136 --> 00:37:53,204
to other haberdasheries
and -- and other things?

00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:55,940
Yes, I'm planning
to have my own clothing line

00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,142
by the time I'm 20.

00:37:57,142 --> 00:37:58,877
20? Okay, good.
Nine years.

00:37:58,877 --> 00:38:01,513
Why do you believe
that you need an investor

00:38:01,513 --> 00:38:03,748
instead of growing the business
steadily on your own

00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:05,483
and making all the profit
for yourself?

00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:09,354
Because I believe I am an
n.B.T. -- The next big thing --

00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:11,222
and because I've been in --

00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:13,458
oh, my goodness. did you just
say "n.b.t. -- next big thing"?

00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:14,359
Yes.
[ laughter ]

00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:15,560
moRRIS:
And we feel like,

00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,495
with your funding
and with your connections,

00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:19,664
we can grow faster,
we can really get
the brand out there.

00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:21,332
And we want to take the world
of male accessories

00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:23,434
and kind of turn it
upside down.

00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:26,371
We want cool socks. We want
fun bow ties, fun neckties.

00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:29,974
Guys, I'll get it started.

00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,110
Um, I -- mo, you are
the next big thing.

00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,745
Thank you.

00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:35,113
I'm excited for you,

00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:37,749
but as advanced
as my fashion sense is,

00:38:37,749 --> 00:38:40,251
I don't know
if I'm the guy to help you.

00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:41,219
I'm out.

00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:44,255
Okay. Thank you.

00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:46,658
Mo, I-I appreciate you
coming out here today.

00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,026
Thank you.

00:38:48,026 --> 00:38:50,662
But, uh, I don't think I'm
the right partner for you.

00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,497
There might be somebody else
on this panel

00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,032
who might be
a better fit.

00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:55,967
And for that reason,
I'm out.

00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:58,503
Okay.
Thank you.

00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:01,272
Barbara, Kevin,
Daymond?

00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:03,374
I'll tell you what I'm
smelling right here. [ sniffs ]

00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:04,876
HERJAVEC: What?
I smell a royalty deal.

00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,389
NARRATOR: Two sharks are out,

00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:20,291
but Kevin may be interested.

00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,893
O'LEARY: I'll tell you what I'm
smelling right here. [ sniffs ]

00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:24,562
HERJAVEC: What?
I smell a royalty deal...

00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:26,497
[ laughs ]
Oh, my God.

00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:29,801
...'cause your margins are
so high, they're incredible.

00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:33,605
You could afford
to pay me $3 a tie

00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:35,540
if I give you the $50,000.
don't do it, mo.

00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,675
There's your first offer.
I'll give you the $50,000.

00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:40,178
I don't want
any equity in Mo's Bows.

00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:42,614
I want $3 every time
you sell a tie.

00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:45,016
CORCORAN:
Here's my take on it.

00:39:45,016 --> 00:39:47,585
Um, it's a family business...

00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:49,220
HERJAVEC:
Hmm. That's true.
...And you're doing
very well.

00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,355
Mm-hmm.

00:39:50,355 --> 00:39:52,223
So it's not like you're
standing alone.

00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,858
You're surrounded by people
that love you, support you,

00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:56,027
and they're working
for you.
moRRIS: Okay.

00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:57,562
And you're hardly grown-up.
[ chuckles ]

00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,664
I honestly don't think
you need anybody's help.

00:39:59,664 --> 00:40:01,866
I think you're
on to something here.

00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:03,935
Your margins are great.
You're selling them.

00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:05,870
If you could keep
the publicity going...

00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:08,139
Mm-hmm.
...I think that is amazing,
and you being who you are,

00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:10,775
why wouldn't everybody write
about you?
Yeah.

00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:11,743
Right?
Absolutely.

00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,378
For those reasons, I'm out.

00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:18,950
JOHN: So, I-In 1989,

00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:22,487
I was offered $10,000
for 40% of my company,

00:40:22,487 --> 00:40:26,057
and my company was only a couple
of hats I made, right?

00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:27,725
10 years later,
that would've been worth,

00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:30,628
to somebody else,
$40 million.

00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:34,933
I'm glad
I didn't take that money.

00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:36,834
I strongly suggest

00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:39,404
that you don't take on investors
at this time.

00:40:39,404 --> 00:40:43,541
So I will guarantee
to mentor you,

00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,944
but I will not give you
the money at this time.

00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:47,245
And I think the mentoring

00:40:47,245 --> 00:40:49,180
is way more valuable
than the money.

00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,548
Absolutely.

00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:52,684
So, in regards to the deal,
I'm out.
Okay.

00:40:52,684 --> 00:40:54,385
In regards to mentoring,
I'm in.

00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:55,653
Perfect.

00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:57,655
And don't do this deal.
[ chuckles ]

00:40:57,655 --> 00:40:59,624
O'LEARY: You know, here's
the thing, mo. I believed
in you from the beginning.

00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,459
And the way I'm showing my
belief is I'm writing a check.

00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,661
Everybody else -- talk.

00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:06,631
You also will have
Mr. Wonderful as a mentor
instead of myself.

00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:08,700
No, no,
you can also mentor.
Wow.

00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,369
I won't -- I won't --
I wouldn't be able to do that

00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:14,272
because you -- it will show that
you're not listening to me.

00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:16,808
I want to take you
down the path that I want.
Wow! Listen to that.

00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,443
Wow. Good move, Daymond.
He's telling you
not to take my money.

00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:20,078
So once you do
10,000 ties,

00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:22,246
think about sending
this guy $30,000

00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:24,115
every time
you do your ties...

00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:25,249
And you would've made
on that --
...Forever.

00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:26,617
Mo, I-I know --
Mo, I know

00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:28,686
it's a very -- it's a very,
very difficult decision.

00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,056
What are you
going to do?

00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:37,028
Well, we appreciate
all of your comments and
all of your feedback.

00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:39,497
Um, Mr. Wonderful, Kevin,
we appreciate your offer,

00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,699
but we're going
to have to decline.

00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:42,433
Yes.

00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:43,868
Yes.
HERJAVEC: Yay!

00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:45,703
Daymond, we would love
to -- to work with you

00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:47,572
as a mentor...
absolutely.

00:41:47,572 --> 00:41:49,007
...And take Mo to --
to the next level

00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:50,308
of where --
of where he could go.

00:41:50,308 --> 00:41:51,642
Do you agree
with that, Mo?

00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:53,544
Mo? Okay.
Mm-hmm.

00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:55,513
mo, you're thinking about it,
and mom doesn't like it.
I'm checking
with the C.E.O.

00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,482
mo is the C.E.O., but I'm
the C.E.O. Of mo, so...

00:41:57,482 --> 00:41:59,951
JOHN: There you go.
CUBAN: Good luck, guys.

00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:02,053
Thank you guys so much.
We really appreciate
the offer. Thank you.

00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:03,121
Good luck.
Congratulations, mo.

00:42:03,121 --> 00:42:04,956
All right, and I'll be
speaking to you.

00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:06,657
All right, perfect.

00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:09,927
BRIDGES: I walked out with
Daymond John as my mentor.

00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:12,530
Ba-zam!
I'm on my way.

00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,132
And you know what I like
about him?

00:42:14,132 --> 00:42:16,200
He said he's gonna do clothing
by the age of 20.

00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,636
Nine years. He's not thinking
tomorrow, tomorrow.

00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:20,338
He's gonna develop
his business.

00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:22,040
I think you did him
a huge disservice.

00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,441
I think you're an animal.

00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:25,109
No, listen. I think that
would've worked beautifully.

00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:25,977
