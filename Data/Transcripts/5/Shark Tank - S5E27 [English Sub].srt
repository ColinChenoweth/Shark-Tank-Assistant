00:00:00,198 --> 00:00:03,285
NARRATOR:
This is the Shark Tank,
where hopeful entrepreneurs

00:00:03,285 --> 00:00:06,572
get a once-in-a-lifetime chance
to pitch the sharks

00:00:06,572 --> 00:00:08,207
in hopes
of getting an investment

00:00:08,207 --> 00:00:10,910
to start, grow,
or save their businesses.

00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,146
The most difficult thing about
wearing Angellift for women

00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:14,614
is just to be quiet
for a few minutes.

00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:16,783
NARRATOR: The entrepreneurs
must convince a shark

00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:19,252
to invest the full amount
they're asking for

00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:21,654
or they'll walk away
with nothing.

00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:24,424
I'm seeking $258,000
for 3%.

00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:26,559
Ooh.
That's a problem.
Ooh.

00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,361
NARRATOR: If the sharks
hear a great idea...

00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,996
We did
about $3 million retail.

00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:32,131
You did $3 million
in sales?

00:00:32,131 --> 00:00:33,566
Correct.
Wow.

00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:35,568
I'm taking you
way more seriously now.

00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:38,604
NARRATOR: ...They're ready to
invest using their own money.

00:00:38,604 --> 00:00:40,773
I'll offer you
the $80,000.

00:00:40,773 --> 00:00:43,342
I'll lend you $250,000
as debt.

00:00:43,342 --> 00:00:44,977
NARRATOR: And they're willing
to fight each other

00:00:44,977 --> 00:00:46,579
for a piece of the action.

00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:48,347
We really do think we can make
that $5 million.

00:00:48,347 --> 00:00:49,415
What kind of greed
is this?

00:00:49,415 --> 00:00:51,417
DOUBILET: Don't let
the party hats fool you.

00:00:51,417 --> 00:00:52,919
We're savvy
businesswomen.

00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:54,554
I could put one match
to the bottom of that.

00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,456
It would burn beautifully.

00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:58,057
You're a gold digger.

00:00:58,057 --> 00:01:00,593
I've never heard anybody say
that here in the Shark Tank.

00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:01,627
Sheer evil.

00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,265
NARRATOR:
Who are the sharks?

00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:08,401
They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors

00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,503
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.

00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,574
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist

00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,010
who turned a $10,000 loan

00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,580
into a software business
worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:26,820
Barbara Corcoran went
from waiting tables in Manhattan

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,190
to building the city's
preeminent real-estate empire.

00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,393
Robert Herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,

00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:36,396
is now a technology mogul

00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:40,033
who sold his first internet
companies for over $350 million.

00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,270
Lori Greiner, the queen of QVC,

00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:47,307
holds over 100 patents and
has launched over 300 products,

00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:51,111
grossing over a half a billion
dollars in retail sales.

00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,779
And Mark Cuban,

00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,982
notorious billionaire
entrepreneur, tech guru,

00:01:55,982 --> 00:02:07,127
and the outspoken owner
of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.

00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,462
First into the tank
is an entrepreneur

00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,799
who believes he has a better way
to send a thoughtful gift.

00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,181
Hello, sharks.

00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:31,318
I'm John, and I'm so excited
to introduce to you today

00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:34,688
the world's most genuine
online floral solution --

00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,022
The Bouqs company.

00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:39,492
I'm here seeking
an investment of $258,000

00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,995
in exchange for 3%
of our business.

00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,330
HERJAVEC:
[ laughs ]

00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,864
Now, just by way
of introduction,

00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,333
I'm a Pittsburgh-born guy

00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,135
who knows how to make
a lot of money, Mr. Wonderful,

00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:50,403
selling lovely flowers

00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:52,839
to be sent to the
lovely people in our lives.

00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,240
Lori and Barbara,

00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,775
these are for you.
GREINER: [ laughs ]

00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:58,478
Wow. Man after
my own heart.
CORCORAN:
What a schmoozer.

00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,213
That's our desperado bouquet,

00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:01,881
and this is
our diamonds bouquet.

00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:04,017
You know how to suck up to me,
baby, and I love it.

00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,885
O'LEARY: Are those
real, or are they fake?
GREINER: They're real.

00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:08,121
They're beautiful.
Oh, wow.
They smell great.

00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,589
CUBAN: Are they real?
CORCORAN: Yeah, they're real,
and they're fresh.

00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:10,990
TABIS: So,
this business is working

00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,692
because there are really major
consumer paying points

00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:13,860
in this industry.

00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,463
They say it's $19.99.
You check out at $64.50.

00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:18,665
What's up with that?
Bait-and-switch product.

00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:21,067
You see a photo.
It's not what arrives.

00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:24,003
And this is flowers.
This is supposed to feel good.

00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:26,973
There's a solution,
and the solution is Bouqs.

00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,608
Bouqs are bouquets simplified.

00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,910
Now, there's three things
that we do

00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,946
to really make
our business special.

00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,115
The first --
We have one price.

00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:37,684
It's $40 --
$40 including shipping.

00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,619
There are no "care and handling"
charges.

00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:42,722
And we also don't try to sell
you a cheesy plastic butterfly

00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,291
or some balloons that just
degrades the experience.

00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,693
The second thing
we do differently

00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,996
is we ship straight from
eco-friendly, sustainable farms

00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:53,733
located on the equator
on the side of a volcano.

00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,736
Seriously.
That's the volcano.

00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,338
It also means
you get a really fresh stem,

00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,039
because it comes
straight from the farm.

00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,875
The third and final thing
we do differently

00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,410
is our concierge service.

00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,513
You can schedule an entire
year's worth of deliveries.

00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:08,882
Birthdays, anniversaries,
important business dates --

00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:11,251
We take care of it for you,
and we do it all at a discount.

00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,253
Business is blooming.

00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,889
Let's get you guys out of
the water and onto the volcano.

00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:18,691
Who's with me as we build
the next big flower brand

00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:20,226
at the Bouqs company?

00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,628
Tell us about
the business.

00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:24,130
The business is essentially
an e-commerce business.

00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,666
We launched this business
about 11 months ago.

00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,269
This year to date,
we've done $700,000 in sales

00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,737
with almost no
marketing budget.

00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,505
Wow. Good for you.

00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:35,008
What are you attributing
your success to?

00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,243
I think people were ready
for something that feels

00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:38,845
a little different
in this space.

00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:41,614
Is this a $40 bouquet,
this bouquet you just gifted me?

00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:42,916
That's a $50 bouquet.

00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,584
I thought you said
you had one price.
$50.

00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:45,952
I thought you said
everything was $40.
Everything was $40.

00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,188
So, our $40 price
is for all of our skus,

00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:50,323
and you can double that sku
for $10 more,

00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,025
and you can triple it
for $10 more than that.
When you say
double the sku --

00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,828
When you say "double," you mean
double the amount of flowers?
Exactly.

00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:55,862
So, if mine is --
That's the most
exciting angle,

00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:56,930
and you didn't
even mention that.

00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,631
It really is.
That's a great angle.

00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,267
Let -- Let's go back
for a second before we
dive into the numbers.

00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,570
How did you even
start the business?

00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,905
TABIS: We started the company,
actually, with my co-founder.

00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:06,906
His name's J.P. MontÃºfar.

00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:08,208
He's actually on the volcano,

00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,043
which is why he couldn't
be here today.

00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:13,179
And he's the sort of
floral-farming expert,

00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:15,381
and I'm more of the front-end
operations, marketing,

00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:16,416
brand side of things.

00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,985
GREINER: And explain
to us the volcano.

00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,088
I-I don't know a lot about where
different flowers come from.

00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,356
At the bottom
of this volcano,

00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:27,026
are there a lot of very
prolific floral farms?

00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:28,161
Absolutely.

00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,897
What is your cost
of customer acquisition?

00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:32,799
Our average, year-to-date,
is $13.

00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,467
Yeah?
Last month was 20 bucks.

00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:37,203
Wow.
Just give us what data
went into that number.

00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:39,639
So, it's a combination
of some really amazing P.R.,

00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:43,443
Oprah magazine, dailycandy,
thrillist, Wall Street journal.

00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:46,212
How much money have you
spent just on P.R.?

00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:47,614
No, not P.R. --
Marketing, advertising.

00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:52,252
Total marketing to date
has been...about $70,000.

00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:56,189
What does the $40 bouquet
cost you?

00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:00,026
We're at 40% to 50% gross
margins on the smallest size.

00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,462
When we get up
to the triple bouquets,

00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,330
we're closer to
the 50% end of that range.

00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,899
Do you ship overnight?
I order today,

00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,333
it's my husband's birthday
tomorrow.

00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,801
Do I get them
tomorrow?
We do not.

00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,436
It is six days
to delivery...

00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:11,905
Whoa!
Ooh.

00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:13,573
HERJAVEC: Six days?
...From your first
order -- paid order.

00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,041
Oh, I think you just ran
into a buzzsaw.

00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,110
John, the average guy
doesn't realize...

00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,479
Whoa.
...It's his wife's birthday
until that morning.

00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,581
I understand it. This is --
CORCORAN: [ laughs ]
until she tells him.

00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:22,882
How is he gonna
wait six days?

00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,384
So, two answers
to this question.

00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,419
One is overnight shipping
launches in three weeks.

00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,354
We're doing the same exact model
with California farms...

00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:31,758
Oh, okay.
...To satisfy
the shorter lead time.

00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,893
What will the price be
with overnight shipping?
Same prices,
same margins?

00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,296
$10 more on everything,
slightly lower margins.
Ah.

00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:38,698
But aren't you --
So, you're totally changing
your model already.

00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,567
Um, I don't know
that we're changing it.

00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,269
It's still farm-fresh,
farm-direct...
You upped the price.
You got --

00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:47,140
You have it from California, and
it's going to be $50, actually.
Yes.

00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,810
Some of our roses will last
in your home three weeks.

00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,812
Why is that?
And people tweet about that,
people talk about it.

00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:55,615
What do you attribute
that to?
So, my co-founder J.P.'s

00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,750
background in biology
has come in very handy.

00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,586
We actually have
a proprietary process

00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,588
that we use
to hydrate the flowers.

00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,690
And then the other thing is
you're getting these flowers

00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,491
four or five days
after they were cut.

00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:07,460
Whenever you're
at a local florist,

00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,628
they're,
just by definition,

00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,196
because it takes so long
for them to get there,

00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,598
and then they have
to hold that inventory,

00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:12,932
just much older flowers.

00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:16,769
O'LEARY:
Let's go back to the numbers,
because no one's tackled

00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,972
what really matters here --
Your evaluation.

00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:22,041
My math, I think, is correct at
$8.6 million you're asking for?

00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,076
That's right.

00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:24,744
Okay, so,
let's be pragmatic.

00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:28,181
You're going to do $800,000
in this calendar year, right?

00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,882
We're gonna do
$1.2 million.

00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:33,019
And you're going to make
on that about $250,000 pre-tax?

00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,587
Yes.
Okay.

00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:36,489
So, how do I value
your business?

00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:39,792
Give me the metrics that
makes you worth $8.6 million.
Sure.

00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,327
So, the growth
has been astronomical.

00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:42,929
We started the business
10 months ago,

00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,931
and we started
with $13,000

00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:46,899
in our total, sort of,
friends-and-family round,

00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,101
which was
literally, like,

00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,003
my parents and my sisters
and my best friends.

00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:52,739
And we grew that
into $700,000 in sales.

00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:54,674
You said you raised $13,000,
friends and family.

00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:55,942
Have you raised any money
since then?

00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:59,245
We closed a seed round
in may of $1.1 million.

00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,346
At what valuation?

00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,281
That was
a $5.2 post money.

00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,183
To me, that --
That's a huge problem.

00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,918
I don't like to be
just one of many.

00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,420
I don't like
to be dumb money.

00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,789
And for that reason,
I'm out.

00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,762
HERJAVEC: You just
raised the $1.1 million.

00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:17,664
Why are you here
looking for $258,000?

00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:20,800
We're actually raising
a full round of $1 million.

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,635
O'LEARY: So, you -- You have
an existing round that's open,

00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:26,839
and the investors are willing to
pay a 40-times free cash flow.

00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,374
I'm a very pragmatic
investor.

00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:29,842
I don't care
what you're selling.

00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,544
What matters in business
is cash flow.

00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:32,545
That's it.

00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:35,114
You're asking me
to pay 40 times,

00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:38,151
which would be
the absolute premium

00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:40,720
that I would pay
for a much larger company.

00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,189
But he's growing.
Yeah, b-but it's
a flower business.

00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,826
GREINER: Your angle -- The thing
that I saw is different...

00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,261
What's his angle?
Tell me that.

00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:50,463
...Was that it's
$40 a bouquet.

00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:53,966
That's it. No added charges.
No shipping and handling.

00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:57,637
And you can upgrade
for $10 to a $50 bouquet.

00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,039
My problem is

00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:03,309
all your competition
can do exactly what you said

00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,445
if they like the idea
and the strategy,

00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:11,084
so, for me, I think that this
doesn't have an edge anymore

00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:13,319
over any other
floral company.

00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:14,320
I'm out.

00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,625
All right, look,
$258,000 for 3%,

00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,729
I mean, that -- it's such
a small, irrelevant amount

00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,697
to what
you've already raised.

00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:26,065
I-I have a challenge
with that,

00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,433
and I don't know

00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,202
if your competitive
advantage

00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:30,336
is sustainable.

00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,638
I'm out.

00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:34,741
CORCORAN: I want to address
the name of your business.

00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,377
I think it's
a terrible name.

00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:40,747
It's hard to spell,
hard to remember.

00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,815
If you gave me
a spelling test,

00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:44,650
it would take me 10 times
to really get it.

00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,852
I'm out.

00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:52,592
As usual, all roads
back to Mr. Wonderful.

00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,729
I tell you, John, there's
one problem with your deal.

00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,932
You are crazy expensive.

00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:04,103
I think the risk in your deal
is not executional risk

00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,938
'cause it sounds like
you know what you're doing.

00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,006
It's exit risk.

00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:09,008
You have to be acquired
by a strategic.

00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:11,577
Very true.
You're in
the Neverland.

00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,913
You're in a place
where it's not that attractive,

00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,915
and you didn't really
differentiate yourself

00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,116
against the commodity

00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,519
other than to tell me
you're a better marketer.

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,720
That may be true,

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,755
but I think you may die
of old age waiting to exit.

00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,157
But there's
another problem.

00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,993
If I want to send flowers
to your grave,

00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,961
I have to wait
six days...

00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,863
[ laughter ]
...And I think --

00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:34,300
And I think
you died here today.

00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,568
I'm out.

00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,204
Well, I very much appreciate

00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:39,772
all of your time
and -- and your input,

00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,240
and thank you so much
for having me.

00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,408
Good luck, John.

00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:43,843
Thank you
for the flowers.

00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,678
You're welcome.
Yeah.

00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:49,749
Kevin sending flowers
to my grave

00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:52,151
was a really funny comment,
but he forgot

00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,220
that we offer overnight shipping
from California,

00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,922
so they can show up to my grave
right on time.

00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:58,257
[ sighs ]
Brutal.

00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:10,203
NARRATOR: Next into the tank

00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:13,406
is a unique way
to solve an age-old problem.

00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,619
Hi, sharks.

00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,621
I am Aaron Bruce.

00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,990
My company is Angellift.

00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,560
I'm here seeking
a half-million dollars

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,963
in exchange
for 10% of my company.

00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:39,932
You know,
nobody wants to look old.

00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:41,968
In fact,
women spend billions

00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:45,705
injecting poisons, acids,
even animal parts

00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,841
into their face, and that's
just to try and remove wrinkles.

00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,544
Laugh lines, smile lines,
frown lines, lip lines.

00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,613
There's all kinds
of names for them.

00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:55,248
They all make us look old.

00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:57,283
I believe
that we have developed

00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,819
one of the greatest anti-aging
tools of our generation.

00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:02,555
And I'd like to introduce
to you now Angellift.

00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,324
Angellift is the only

00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:08,628
under-the-skin facial
lifting strips in the world.

00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:10,963
Through the use
of light, soft pressure,

00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:14,600
we can not only stop
this facial movement,

00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,302
we can restore
facial contours.

00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,470
We can lift out lines.

00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,839
We can add volume
to lips.

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,009
Angellift is worn exactly like
teeth-whitening strips --

00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:25,311
10 to 30 minutes a day,
then you put them away.

00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:26,545
They're worn when you're
completely relaxed,

00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:27,546
when it's comfortable
for you.

00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:29,782
[ laughter ]

00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,117
The most difficult thing about
wearing Angellift for women

00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,919
is just to be quiet
for a few minutes.

00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,388
CORCORAN: Ohh.
CUBAN: Wow.

00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:37,056
HERJAVEC: Whoa!
O'LEARY: Clearly...
Do not make any comments.

00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:39,525
...We can really use
Angellift up here.

00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:41,093
Aaron, you're not
married, obviously.

00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,094
Well, I am.

00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,996
This is my beautiful wife,
Kelly.

00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,465
She's our best model.

00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:50,036
Clearly, Angellift is
a game-changer in this industry.

00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:51,370
And in many, many cases,

00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,206
Angellift has been a
life-changer for a lot of women.

00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:55,541
I've come here to "Shark Tank"

00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,144
to find a partner to help me
build an amazing brand.

00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:59,512
Does this work
permanently?

00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,447
This has a cumulative effect
on the skin.

00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,050
Your mouth, unlike
any other part of your body,

00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,218
reacts to pressure
and reacts very fast.

00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:08,187
We've found out through
orthodontists on our team

00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:09,855
that the same thing happens
with braces.

00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:12,191
When you put braces on, which
lift two to four millimeters,

00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,160
you instantly get
almost a facelift,

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,762
but months after
they're removed, with adults,

00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,965
they see the wrinkles
begin to come back.
Really?

00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,434
But the pressure causes
a cumulative action
within your mouth.

00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,803
Kelly's gonna hand out
some -- some samples for you.

00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,371
CUBAN: You guys are both
in your 70s, right?

00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,372
[ laughter ]
KELLY: Right.

00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,174
80s. But you're close.
Thanks.

00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:29,575
O'LEARY:
Why is it only for women?

00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:33,679
It's not. 30% of our --
Of our customers are men.

00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,880
How much do they sell for,

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,882
and what are your total --
Total revenues?

00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:40,119
Okay, so, we only sold these
in a test market, all right?

00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,154
We took an unfinished product,
and we took it

00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:45,024
to the smallest live shopping
channel in the country.

00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:48,394
In that test market,
we did about $3 million retail.

00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,696
We profited $1.2 million.

00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:52,264
HERJAVEC: You did
$3 million in sales?

00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:53,866
In a test. Correct.
Wow.

00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,434
We pulled out of there,

00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,169
but we are still filling orders

00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,838
from shows that happened
over six months ago.

00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,440
Aaron, you have to wear them
for how long?

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,443
30 minutes a day --
30 to an hour a day for 30 days

00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:05,611
would take out
about 87%.

00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,580
So you have
to wear these forever?

00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,348
No, you have to do
what we call maintenance wear.

00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,484
So maybe once a week, you'll
wear them once the lines are out

00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:12,785
because you'll need to
tell your body

00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,253
that you still need
that space.

00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:15,721
Well, you have pictures here --
Before and afters.

00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:16,722
Mm-hmm.

00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:19,225
Same model.
These are not retouched.

00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:20,226
No.

00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:22,728
So how long
a period of time

00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,597
from the "before"
to the "after" there?

00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,065
These are 30 days.
30 days.

00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,267
In 30 days, you had
that much improvement.
That much change.

00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:29,635
Wow!

00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:32,738
Is there anything
proprietary about it?

00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:34,073
We are under patent pending
right now.

00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:35,741
Aaron, what do you
sell it for?

00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:37,943
So, when we tested it in
the market, we sold it for $49.

00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:40,579
Did you mention yet whether you
have any proof that it works?

00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:42,048
Real proof.
Absolutely.

00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:44,216
Not only do we have third-party
clinical trials to prove it,

00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:47,553
but we've gone to QVC,
and they took us to theirs.

00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,388
So why are you
 not on QVC?

00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,591
We haven't pursued QVC at all
because we want the public

00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:53,959
to come to us --
To come to Angellift.

00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,227
We don't want to
go to new buyers.

00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,429
Wait.
Aaron, Aaron,
you've done a great job.

00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:57,430
That's the one thing
that's very confusing to me.

00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,364
Yeah,
I'm very confused.

00:14:58,364 --> 00:14:59,899
Here's your pitch --

00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,835
"We have too many sales and have
pulled the product back."

00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,570
We don't -- I don't believe
the product's finished.

00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,972
I want a finished line.
That's what I came here for.

00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:08,941
So, Aaron,
you want to stop sales

00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,776
while you perfect
the product?

00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,044
It's pretty close.

00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:13,712
GREINER: But, Aaron,
that's an easy thing to do.

00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,748
O'LEARY: But that -- Aaron,
that does not make sense.
I know it --

00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,650
Y-you come in the Shark Tank
with a monster success

00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,752
that's generating
over $1 million in free cash.

00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,854
Why wouldn't you
just simply be upgrading --

00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,522
Constantly upgrading
your site,

00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:25,191
constantly upgrading
your package

00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:26,292
while you bring in
the cash?

00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:29,061
I want to maximize
the value of my company.

00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,362
We have a product here

00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:32,598
that will knock out injections
altogether.

00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,799
Yeah, but, Aaron, look --

00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,568
You're talking out of both sides
of your mouth...

00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:36,569
[ laughs ]

00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:37,770
...Because what you're
saying is,

00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,238
"I'm taking back control
of my company."

00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:40,239
Okay, that's fine.

00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,273
That makes for
a good talking point.

00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,975
But you said
you made $1.2 million.

00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:45,177
Mm-hmm.
You're not hurting
for cash, right?

00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:47,379
Then you come in and say,
"I need $500,000.

00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,181
I need your expertise."
[ imitates buzzer ]

00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:52,017
HERJAVEC: The story
just doesn't add up for me.

00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:55,054
To pull a product
that's selling $3 million

00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,523
because it increases
the value of your business --

00:15:57,523 --> 00:16:00,359
You got more guts than I do
'cause I would have --

00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:01,827
I would have
kept selling more.

00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,729
I don't understand
the need.

00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:06,765
And if I don't see
the need...

00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:09,068
My money doesn't go there.
I'm out.

00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:13,405
I appreciate it, Robert.
Thank you.

00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:14,540
I don't think you get it,

00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,041
when you look at this packaging,
what it is.

00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,977
I think you really
have to demonstrate it.
We --

00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,712
So it's a very expensive sell
to demonstrate,

00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:22,515
do an infomercial, do -- do QVC,
whatever you're gonna do,

00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:23,616
but that's necessary.

00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:25,784
I think it's gonna cost
way too much money

00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,486
to make this happen,
so I'm out.

00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,289
Thank you, Barbara.

00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:31,524
Aaron, i-in my world,

00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:33,993
it's evil
if something's selling

00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,427
and you stop doing it.

00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,596
I've never, ever,
ever heard anybody

00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:39,665
say that here
in the Shark Tank.

00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,833
Sheer evil.

00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,836
And I don't want to be
part of it. I'm out.

00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:48,274
How much cash does
the company have in the bank?

00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:50,176
$1 million and change.

00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,377
Yeah, I mean, look --

00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,779
I wanted you to be
the first guy at "Shark Tank"

00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:57,516
to just own it and say,
"I'm here because I'm gonna
sell a crap load more."

00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,518
But you just didn't step up
and own it.

00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,221
I don't trust that you're here
for the right reasons.

00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,389
I'm out.

00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:07,026
So, who's left?
Lori?

00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,360
Lori's intrigued.

00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,795
She sees the opportunity,

00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:10,963
but she's looking
at the price tag,

00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,398
saying,
"Wow, that's a lot."

00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,649
NARRATOR:
Four sharks are out.

00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:33,953
Lori is Aaron's last chance
for a deal.

00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:37,223
I think
it's a QVC product.

00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,425
I think it's
an infomercial product.

00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:43,295
But I have to admit
i-it's a very confusing story.

00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:44,964
You said,
"It was doing great.

00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:46,732
"We were on a shopping channel,
and we pulled it.

00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,833
"We went in to QVC.

00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,135
They loved it,
but then we didn't pursue it."

00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:52,004
'cause he's evil.

00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:53,606
GREINER: I feel very iffy
about what you're doing.

00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:55,274
I still don't really
understand it.

00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:56,842
AARON: Well,
in my opinion, Lori,

00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:59,545
this is a giant package in pink
wrapped up for you.

00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,180
This is your area.
This is your arena.

00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,781
You're the one
that really carries --

00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:06,952
$500,000 for a 10% stake
doesn't do it for me.

00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:11,290
I know the offers we've
already had for our company.

00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,792
I know the kind of sales we do
in a tiny test market.

00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:16,028
I know what we're gonna do.
It's huge numbers.

00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:19,465
I'm gonna make you
a really hard bargain here.

00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:20,466
AARON: Sure.

00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,167
Ooh.
May not take it.

00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:26,438
I want to see
proof of your patent,

00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:30,609
proof of the $3 million
in retail that you've done,

00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,611
and I'd like to see
your clinical trials

00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,246
and see that
they are accurate.

00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:36,115
Those are all easy.

00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,251
I will offer you
the $500,000,

00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:45,624
but I want...
25% of your company.

00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,761
I respect your offer.

00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:50,095
Everything we have going
right now

00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:51,764
is so exciting and so big.

00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:53,666
I was hoping that you
would jump on and enjoy the ride

00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,801
and help us with the direction
of the brand,

00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:59,204
as I would of any of the sharks,
but it's way too high for us.

00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:02,675
Hmm.

00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,576
Do you want to
counter to her?

00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:06,812
I do.
I would offer you 15%.

00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:09,782
What kind of greed
is this?

00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:11,417
CUBAN: You're just
really proving my point, Aaron,

00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:12,885
that you're
a gold digger.

00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:15,321
Oh, I am a gold digger.
I'm an entrepreneur.

00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,357
GREINER: How's this?

00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:22,261
If I gave you
the $500,000,

00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:25,431
I get 15%, as you said,

00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:29,168
but the $500,000
would solely be used

00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:34,440
to fund any purchase orders
that came in from QVC.

00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,843
15%.

00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,945
15% for $500,000.

00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,413
You fund the buy from QVC.

00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:43,015
The $500,000 goes
into an account

00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,017
that solely funds
your QVC purchase orders.

00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,059
Aaron, what are you
gonna do?

00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:59,498
Lori, I'll do the deal.

00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,500
Good.
CUBAN: There you go.

00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,168
There you go.
Thank you, sharks.

00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,037

straighten up faces.

for an update,

any better.

If he doesn't have the patent,
if he can't get on QVC,

00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,551
if he doesn't have the trials,
it's all gone.

to that story.

There's more
to that story.

00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:34,266
NARRATOR: Just this season,
Brian and Julie Whiteman

00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,567
struck a deal
with Kevin and Mark

00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,036
for their photo-book service,
Groovebook.

00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:40,105
The Groovebook app
allows you to choose

00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:42,574
up to 100 photos every month
from your smartphone

00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,977
and create a beautiful, bound,
photo book in just minutes.

00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,712
Let's see what they're
up to now.

00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:51,450
JULIE:
It's only been a week since we
appeared on "Shark Tank,"

00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,119
and things have been
non-stop crazy.

00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:58,290
BRIAN: We got 50,000
new customers in five days,

00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,626
and the orders still
keep coming in by the minute.

00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,094
Yeah?
How's it going today?

00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,595
Good. Good.
Really busy.

00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:07,099
JULIE: It took us one year
to get to 35,000 customers.

00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,636
One night on "Shark Tank,"
we now have 85,000 customers.

00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,638
That equates to $3 million
in sales.

00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:14,673
But once they tell
their friends and their family,

00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:16,175
who knows
what that may turn into?

00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:18,477
It could double.
It could triple.

00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:19,645
JULIE: Kevin!
Brian, Julie.

00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,079
We're so excited
to have you here!

00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,881
O'LEARY: I called
Brian and Julie, and I said,

00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:24,850
"Brian, I want to come out
and see the operation."

00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,151
I want to see
what I'm putting my money into.

00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:27,219
Wow.

00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:28,754
In all the "Shark Tank"
deals I've done,

00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:31,690
I've never seen a tripling
of the user base

00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,226
in a matter of five days --
None of us have.

00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,662
This is where we put
the "groove" in the Groovebook.

00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:39,832
O'LEARY:
The Groovebook story is proof
of the "Shark Tank" factor.

00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:42,267
It's the most powerful
venture-capital firm on Earth.

00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:44,069
It has sharks, it has money,

00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,538
and it has millions
of people watching.

00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:49,208
When you put all of those
together, magic happens.

00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,910
JULIE: Each morning I've
woken up, I've pinched myself.

00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,346
I just can't believe
this is really happening,

00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:58,283
and I just can't wait to see
what happens in the future.

00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:09,728

when he was a third-grader.

Hi, sharks.

00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:27,779
I'm Ryan from Plano, Texas,
and my company is HangEase.

00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:29,915
Today I'm seeking $80,000

00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:33,185
in exchange for a 30% stake
in my company.

00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,520
HangEase is
a collapsible clothing hanger

00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,121
that'll do two things for you.

00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:37,422
First, it'll make it easier

00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:38,924
to get your clothes
off the rack.

00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:40,859
And second, it'll make it easier
to hang your clothes.

00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,195
This will save you
time and money

00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,496
by getting rid
of broken plastic hangers

00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:45,797
and stretched-out shirt necks.

00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:48,500
HangEase was born out
of my third-grade project

00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,668
called
the invention convention,

00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:51,837
where I was told
to walk through my house,

00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,906
find a problem, and solve it.

00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:56,675
The problem I solved
was right in my own closet --

00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:59,344
Broken plastic hangers
and stretched-out shirt necks.

00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:01,046
This drives moms nuts.

00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:04,316
My third-grade solution
looked like this.

00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:09,488
The finished product
looks like this.

00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,323
You see, the way HangEase works
is simple.

00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:13,592
It's built around a hinge
in the center of the hanger

00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:16,194
that collapses
when pressure's applied,

00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:18,196
dropping the shirt off
into your hand.

00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:20,065
It also makes it easier
to hang clothes.

00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,801
You simply insert the hanger
into the shirt neck, pop it out,

00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,336
and it's right back up
on the rack,

00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,405
which I think
is perfect for men

00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,373
'cause some guys never learn how
to hang their clothes properly.

00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:31,209
I sold HangEase
to a major retailer,

00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,511
but due
to the grueling schedule

00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,546
of a third-grader,
I wasn't able to continue.

00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:37,182
But now I'm here and ready
to bring HangEase back.

00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,818
Sharks, I'm 19,
I'm out of high school,

00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:41,053
so who's with me

00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:43,055
to bring a third-grader's dream
back to life?

00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:45,057
Let's get you some samples.

00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:46,058
Ryan, what
do you do now?

00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:47,559
I'm a sophomore at S.M.U.

00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:48,794
Thank you.

00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:50,829
So you've had this product
in your closet for 10 years?

00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:52,164
Yes, seven --
Yes, seven years.

00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:54,132
And just decided
to bring it out now?
Yes.

00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:55,500
Did you dust
these things off?

00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,936
Uh, we -- Yeah, we did.
I've had them in boxes.

00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,805
I use them in my closet,
as well, though, so --
[ chuckles ]

00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:01,406
You really had them in boxes
for seven years? Tell me.

00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:02,808
I have. Yes.

00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:04,009
Well, Ryan,
you said in grade 3,

00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,210
which was
a long time ago...

00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,645
Yes.
...You sold it
to a big retailer.

00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:07,846
Who was that?
Walmart.

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,449
You got this
in Walmart?

00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,284
And what -- What happened
with those sales?

00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,653
Well, with Walmart,
we sold about --

00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:17,389
It was four --
An order of 400,000 hangers.

00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:18,890
So that's about --
400,000 hangers?!

00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,626
400,000 hangers.
That's about --
[ laughs ] Yes.

00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,260
How did you even
get in to Walmart?

00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,063
Well, one of my, uh,
classmates' friends --

00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:26,164
I think she was
a sales broker,

00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:27,399
and she had
a relationship with them.

00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:28,600
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,068
One of your classmates'
friends --

00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:32,404
One of my classmates' mothers.
Mothers -- Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:34,239
So one of your third --
Oh, mothers, okay, there we go.
Oh. Whoa.

00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:35,340
One of my classmates'
mothers, right --

00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,475
Uh, she has a company

00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,976
that has a relationship
with retailers,

00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,845
and she had a relationship
with Walmart,

00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:42,280
and she was walking through
the invention convention

00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,049
and saw my product,
and she loved it.

00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:45,884
Now, how much of it
did you sell in Walmart?

00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:47,719
Their sale was for $200,000.

00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:49,154
How much money
did you make?

00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,722
I made $70,000 off of that.

00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:53,325
If it was selling through them
and it was successful,

00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,160
why wouldn't they
keep going with it?

00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:59,131
My suspicion is that it wasn't
really marketed well.

00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:00,465
GREINER: What did
one piece sell for?

00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:02,367
Uh, they sold for
about $3.89.

00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:04,436
All right, so, Ryan --
A hanger? a hanger?
$3.89 apiece?

00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:06,672
A four-pack.
A four-pack for $3.89.

00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:11,143
So, what do a pack
of regular plastic hangers cost

00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:12,811
compared to
a pack of yours?

00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:14,613
Like...88 cents.

00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:15,647
[ chuckles ]

00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,115
Did you file
for a patent?

00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:18,717
Yes, I have
a fully issued utility patent.

00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:20,485
So I have
a big question.
Mm-hmm.

00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:23,455
I've seen other products
out there like this.

00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:25,891
Really?

00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,861
I've done research
on a bunch of hangers,

00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,096
and I haven't
ever seen anything

00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:33,031
that does
what my product does.

00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,033
CORCORAN: You've seen no
foldable hangers at all?

00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,468
Yeah, I have seen --
I've definitely seen --

00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:38,437
N-nothing with
the pressure application.

00:25:38,437 --> 00:25:39,838
CUBAN: I think what
Lori's saying, too --

00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:41,373
When you buy a hanging bag,
for instance --
Mm-hmm.

00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:44,409
Suitcase, hanging bag, right?
You get metal things.

00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:47,679
Like, there's a little metal
thing that collapses so that
you can put it --

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,681
HERJAVEC: Oh, yeah.
You're right.
GREINER:
Great point, Mark.

00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:51,483
Tell me again.
I'm a retailer.

00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:52,751
What is the --
What is the benefit, again,

00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:55,353
to me,
of using your hanger?

00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:56,655
You're selling clothes?
Yeah.

00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:59,124
The benefit of this, opposed to
using a normal hanger,

00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:00,459
is when people come in

00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:02,027
and they try and get
your clothes off to try them on

00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:04,029
or they're messing with it
out there --
They just yank it.

00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:06,465
It -- It can damage
your clothes.

00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:08,533
I'm that guy, right?
[ chuckling ]
You are that guy.

00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:09,801
I'm that guy.
Boom, there it is.

00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:11,036
There's a sweater
or whatever.

00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:12,571
Pull. That's it, right?
Right.

00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,573
But why does a high-end retailer
care about

00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:17,075
tearing clothes off his hangers?
Why would --

00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,677
Because when idiots like me
pull it off,

00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:19,845
they don't want it
to be damaged.

00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:21,413
It's a common problem,
though.
No.

00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,181
I mean, the reason why I've seen
this out there a lot

00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:24,716
is because
it's a common problem.

00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:25,984
HERJAVEC: Well, look,
I've learned one thing today.

00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:27,586
I thought Mark Cuban
was a slob.

00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,788
I've learned
he's a real slob.
[ chuckles ]

00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:31,890
So I don't see the application
for the product.

00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:32,891
Um...

00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,460
I'm out.

00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,696
Okay. Thank you so much
for your time.

00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,665
I-I don't think you have
a chance of survival with this

00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:41,933
'cause it's too expensive.

00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,136
I personally do not see
the vision

00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:46,404
of this opportunity
at all.

00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:47,806
And it bores
the crap out of me.

00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:48,907
Oh.

00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:51,476
I'm out.

00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:53,779
Okay.
Thank you so much.

00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,480
Here's my read on it.

00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,784
I've invested in a few
businesses on "Shark Tank"

00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:02,587
that were businesses put to
the side and then brought back.

00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,024
On those few businesses,
I've never done well.

00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:08,960
And I think because while
you're putting it to the side,

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,097
the passion goes with it,
and it's hard to really go back

00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:14,800
and travel in time
and kick that product back in

00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,701
with the same heart in it,
all right?

00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:18,804
This is an old idea
that you stuffed in your closet.

00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,038
You ought to leave it there
and move on.

00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,039
I'm out.

00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,075
Okay, thank you so much.

00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:26,044
Who's left?
Mark...
And Lori.

00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:27,045
...And Lori.

00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:30,215
Ryan, who's your primary
competition?

00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:31,550
I -- There's
really not anything

00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,851
that does the pressure thing
out there.

00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:34,719
There's nobody else
that you've seen that folds?

00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:36,254
I guess the ma--
Right, the major competition

00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:37,722
would be the normal
plastic hanger, but --

00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:38,890
You've seen nobody
who folds.

00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,091
I-I haven't.
I haven't. I've --

00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:41,459
I've seen this.
I know I've seen it.

00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:42,594
Okay.

00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:44,496
Now, I'm not sure.
I just can't remember.

00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:45,797
Mark said he's seen it.

00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:46,965
Definitely in luggage,
I've seen it.

00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:49,167
But what about it?
Well, so I'm asking.

00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,702
I mean, what are we
missing here?

00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:51,837
There's got to be

00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:53,438
some competition somewhere
that's comparable.

00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:55,006
Nothing?
You know what
you're missing here?

00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,708
You're missing there's
no real problem to solve.

00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:58,310
No, I don't believe that at all,
'cause I see --

00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,945
Look, just being --
I don't mind a kid
with a messy closet.

00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:02,013
You have two children,
correct?
Three. Yeah.

00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,749
Three? It's -- Get their clothes
off the rack like that?
Forget my children.

00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:06,351
Me -- Right?
No, literally, I yank. I yank.

00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,352
Right.
I'm a yanker.

00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,087
I-I see the value, right?

00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:11,156
But it's just
inconceivable to me

00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:13,425
that there's nothing else
like this that you've seen.

00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:15,160
Or you just haven't
done the work.

00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:20,398
It concerns me
that others are out there

00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:22,200
really cornering
the market,

00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,604
I think, using your idea.

00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:28,640
And I'm not sure if they
infringe your patent or not.

00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,108
That's the problem.
Right.

00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:32,644
What are you gonna do?

00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:34,412
So make a contingency deal
with the kid.

00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:36,848
Come on.

00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:40,852
CUBAN: Look,
I'll -- I'll make you a deal.

00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:44,890
But, to everybody's point,

00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:48,093
there is uncertainty relative
to the competition.

00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:50,195
Okay.
There is uncertainty
to whether or not

00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:51,696
your patent's
being violated.

00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:55,567
So, contingent on the patent
being legit and covering

00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,669
and that we do
have protection,

00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:00,805
I'll offer you
the $80,000 for 30%,

00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:01,840
just like you've asked.

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,708
I know Lori's kind of
thinking about this.

00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:05,977
If Lori wants to come in
and split it, that's fine,

00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:08,480
uh, because we -- just
two brains are better than one

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,681
in this particular case.

00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:10,682
Lori?

00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:18,556
I would do it with Mark.
I think you deserve a chance.

00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:21,226
I-I'd love to do that.
Absolutely.

00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:22,761
Done.

00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,262
All right. Done.
Easy, breezy.

00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,630
Wow, you could have asked
for a lot more.

00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,199
Yeah, we could have,
but why?
Thank you, Mark.

00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:29,167
I'll even throw in
some Mavs t-tickets

00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:30,168
so you can come
to a game.

00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:31,169
I'd love it.
[ laughs ]

00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:32,771

Thank you so much.

00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,906
You're welcome.
I just got to check.
I just got to check this.

00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:37,208
Watch.
Yeah.

00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:38,376
See, that's great.

00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:39,611
Hang one up real fast.
It makes it easy.

00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,246
That plays. Yeah.
It's great.

00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:42,547
I'll just use them at home.
It's worth it.

00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:43,548
$80,000 worth of hangers.

00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:44,749

Nothing.

00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,619
Thank you all.
GREINER: Yeah.

00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,154
I can't even tell you
how many times

00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:50,689
I've pulled down on something
that's on a hanger

00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:51,823
and then boomeranged it,
you know.

00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:53,325
Right.

00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:55,593
LANDIS: I'm feeling awesome.

00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:57,128
I've worked really hard
on this product.

00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,730
It's been a part of me
since third grade,

00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,066
and I'm crazy excited that I got
a deal with Mark and Lori today

00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:03,168
and we can do some great
business together in the future.

We're friends living
in Brooklyn, New York.

00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:25,991
I've always been
an environmentalist

00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,592
who loves
to throw parties.

00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:29,160
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!

00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,496
These days, we're living
so much of our lives

00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,564
behind a computer screen,

00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:34,499
but having a party
or an event

00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:37,569
makes people come out and
meet each other face-to-face.

00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:41,072
We just got picked up
in the Southwest region.

00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:42,073
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!

00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:43,875
Our company is unique

00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:46,511
because we're building a
culture that's a little
weird but a lot of fun.

00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,746
Bring it in.

00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:50,648
We take time out for
a dance break during work,

00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:54,119
or even a yoga break
to keep us energized.

00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:56,187
Yes!
Purchase order.

00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,423
Our company is growing
like crazy.

00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:00,825
We really need
a capital infusion

00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:01,826
to get this party
started.

00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:04,029
We've put in
our personal savings,

00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:05,563
left stable, paying jobs,

panic attacks at night.

00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:09,501
We're losing money
quickly,

00:31:09,501 --> 00:31:11,870
but there's a light
at the end of the tunnel.

00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,538
We're so close
to profitability,

00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,440
and the sharks
can help us get there.

And I'm
Emily Doubilet.

00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,796
We live in Brooklyn,

00:31:37,796 --> 00:31:40,965
TOGETHER:
We're the owners of Susty Party!

00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:43,468
We're seeking $250,000

00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:47,172
in exchange for 10% of our
party-tableware company.

00:31:47,172 --> 00:31:50,241
Parties and events produce
a huge amount of waste.

00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,977
As an environmental-studies
grad from Oberlin college,

00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:55,046
and as an entertainer
at heart,

00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:57,916
I've always believed
in order to change the world,

00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,617
throw a better party.

00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:03,421
When I ran into Emily
at -- where else -- a party,

00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,623
I was looking to leave
my Wall Street job

00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:07,859
and put my Harvard
economics degree to use

00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:10,228
building a business
that was good for people,

00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:13,465
the planet, and profit --
The triple bottom line.

00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:17,936
So, Susty -- Short for
"sustainable" -- Party was born.

00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,538
We've created
a retail line

00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:22,774
of eco-friendly,
highly functional,

00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:26,578
mix-and-match party tableware,
all made in the U.S.a.

00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:30,849
With factories who employ and
empower the visually impaired.

00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:33,418
Our products are not
just plain brown or white

00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:36,988
like other natural tableware,
but colorful and fun.

00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:38,790
The cups, straws,
and cutlery

00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,558
are made from sustainably
harvested wood,

00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:43,728
and the napkins are made
from 100% recycled paper.

00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:44,796
Our plates and bowls

00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,098
are made from tapioca starch
and grass fiber,

00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:49,834
but they're super sturdy,
even oven- and microwave-safe.

00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:52,670

throw a little party,

Can I only buy these
from you, or can I buy
from other people?

00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:36,548
We contract
a manufacturer.

CORCORAN:
I'm sorry, does that mean

00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:39,851
that someone else can order
the same plates

00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,086
from that particular factory
if they wanted?

00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:44,622
We have sales-channel
distribution, like --

00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:46,758
Yes. the answer
is yes, right?
CUBAN: So, you're a branding
play, basically.

00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,726

and, you know,

00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:53,598
we are bringing
a few new products

that are gonna be
the first on the market.

00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:58,236
What do your plates cost
for the same amount of plates

00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,505
that aren't
environmentally conscious?

00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:02,340
Our seven-inch plates retail
for about $4.99

00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,608
for the pack of eight.

00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:06,244
A thin paper plate might
be half that price,

00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:07,845
but it's not competing.

00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:09,514
Our plates are very sturdy,

00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:13,084
so we would compare them to,
like, a thick plastic plate.

00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:15,186
CUBAN: So, where are you
selling? how's it selling?

00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:16,788
Give us the metrics.

00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:19,190
We're carried by the largest
natural-products retailer

00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,692
in the country,
Whole Foods.

00:34:20,692 --> 00:34:23,428
So far, this year, we've done
$1 million in sales.

00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:24,762
You've got
to be kidding.

00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:26,364
That's fantastic!
We're on track

00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:28,433
to do $1.5 million
by the end of this year,

00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:30,501
which is triple
what we did last year.

00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:32,537

Good for you. Wow.
Wow. Wasn't expecting
that answer.

00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:35,273
I'm taking you
way more seriously now.

00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:37,275
Don't let the party hats
fool you.

00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:38,910
We're savvy

[ laughs ]

00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,979
We've been profitable
for the last three months.

00:34:40,979 --> 00:34:42,981
We know we can grow.

00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:45,617
From $1.5 million this year,
if we get an investment,

00:34:45,617 --> 00:34:48,553
we can expand our sales channels
and expand our product lines

00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:50,088
and do $5 million
next year.

00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,624
So, this year,
with all the slotting fees,

00:34:52,624 --> 00:34:56,694
launching nationally, we're
gonna net about an $80,000 loss.

00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:59,697
How much cash do you have
in the bank?

00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:01,532
We have about $30,000
in the bank right now.

00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:03,067
Ooh.
That's a problem.
Ooh.

Jessica, how much in inventory
to do have today?

00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:09,607
Right now, we have about
$125,000 in inventory.

00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,776
That's a lot of money
in inventory.
GREINER:
the big interest to me --

00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,112
You got to move
that inventory, Jessica.
So, you're at negative
current assets.

00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,247
But we are, however,

00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:19,851
on that $5 million that we think
we can get to next year,

00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,853
we -- we would net
a $600,000 profit.

00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:24,756
Jessica, where are you getting
the cash to fund the loss?

00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:27,725
We do have some debt that
we've gotten from some angels.
How much?

00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:29,661
It's about $200,000 --
A little over $200,000.

00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:32,230
I don't want to poop
on the party here,

00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,866
but you're asking me
for $250,000 for 10%.

00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:37,035
You're putting an imputed value
of $2 1/2 million on it.

00:35:37,035 --> 00:35:40,204
Do you think, if I wanted
to enter this business in
an identical way...
[ chuckles ]

00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:42,774
...That I -- That I could --
CORCORAN: Oh, I can so see you
in this business, Kevin.

00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:44,175
There's only happy people
allowed in your business.

00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:46,411
Do you think I could do
what you've done

00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:48,346
for a lot less
than $2 1/2 million?
No, absolutely not.

00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:50,181
We have a few reasons
for you.
No way.

00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:52,116
So, one,
we're authentic.

00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:54,052
As you can see, we live
and breathe our mission.

00:35:54,052 --> 00:35:55,553
What does that mean?
I'm authentic, too.

00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:56,854
You're authentic?
Very.

00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:59,757
We're responsive. We know
exactly what our customers want.

00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:01,259

We listen
to our customers.

My point is, anybody
can do what you're doing.

00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:06,130
Would they work as hard as we do
for as little pay as we do?

00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,466
Would they spend years
researching the market

00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:11,803
to know every sustainable
factory and scientist out there?
Maybe, but that's
the problem with your deal.

00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:14,739
Would they know exactly what
the Susty Party customers want?
But it's -- It's a huge problem
with your deal.

00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:17,442
You've met your match.
You've met your match.
Will they show up
at every sales meeting

00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:20,144
with a boom box and a glass
of champagne in hand...
Yes, they will!

00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:21,779
...Ready to bring
the party,

00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:23,514
all while making
our dream a reality?

00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,417
Good for you. My God.
I love this kid.

00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:28,219
More innovation and competitors
are gonna drive us --

00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:30,388
Our industry to have more
sustainable materials out there,

00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:32,523
and we're gonna be one step
ahead of the competition.
You're selling paper plates,

00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,425
and you're telling me you're
worth 2 1/2 million bucks?
It's not paper.

00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:37,395
Are you nuts?
It's not paper.
It's tapioca.
It's not paper.

00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:39,597
I could put one match
to the bottom of that.

00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:41,699
It would burn beautifully.

00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:42,867
Putting Kevin aside
for a sec --

00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,702
And he is bringing up
a legitimate point --

00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,705
Why is the business worth
$2 1/2 million?

00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:50,408
We're gonna do $1.5 million
in sales this year.

00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:53,077
On which you're gonna
lose $80,000.

00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:54,879
But we really do think
we can make that $5 million.

00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,348
And why would we believe
that you could actually build

00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:58,816
the business
from where it is now

00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:01,819
to $5 million
one year from today?

00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:04,288
So, we're introducing
38 new product skus.

00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:06,624
Without purchase orders?

00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:09,160
Uh, yeah, we're --

00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,763
We're kind of coming up
with a plan for that.
You love to talk,

00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:14,065
and you're delicious
to listen to, no doubt.

00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,000
I could spend a whole day
and enjoy every minute.

00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:20,238
But I just don't think
I'm ever going to make
my money back on this.

00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,239
I'm out.

00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,009
Emily, the designs
are fantastic,

00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:27,912
but...you got to run
like heck.

00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:31,549
You got to get market share
above the $5 million level,

00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:33,751
and hopefully,
somebody acquires you.

00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:37,688
Or you then scale back
and then start making a profit.

00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:41,926
I see a tremendous
amount of risk

00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,095
in the business
at this point.

00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,430
I'm out.

00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:48,199
You know, you guys
are a great team.

00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,534
I personally like

00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:52,236
environmentally
conscious products,

00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:53,838
and I like that it's made
in the U.S.a.

00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:57,175
That's great.
More jobs for Americans.

00:37:57,175 --> 00:38:00,278
I would love
to have invested in you,

00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,280
but I just recently invested

00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,716
in a company that makes
gift bags and tissue

00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:08,319
and things like that,
and I think they're going to be

00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:11,789
getting into plates that
are environmentally conscious,

00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:15,126
so, for that reason,
I'm out.

00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,330
The problem with your deal --
And I think the other sharks

00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,966
are starting
to circle these waters --

00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:25,536
This is a total commodity
that you're basically curating.

00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:28,473
Frisky over here is very good
at picking the right colors

00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:29,907
to put on the commodity.

00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:32,276
GREINER:
"Frisky" is a positive.
I'll -- I'll take it.

00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:35,346
So, leaving aside
your valuation issue,

00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:37,748
the risk is
that someone else does this

00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:40,818
that already has a much bigger
distribution channel

00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,420
and a bigger
marketing budget

00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,956
and crushes you like
the frisky cockroaches you are

00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:46,491
in this space right now.

00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:50,495
Everything you're doing
anybody else can get,

00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,697
which is why I believe your
investors have only put debt in,

00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:54,665
not equity.

00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,067
We strategically
took debt

00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:58,002
because we didn't want to give
up ownership of our company.

00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,104
What interest rate
are you paying on your debt?

00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:04,475
Some of them are as low as 4%,
and some are as high as 10%.

00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:10,314
I sense that there's a difficult
situation coming, here.

00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:12,350
Just -- I'm
a balance-sheet guy.

00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,453
I'm looking at what's happening.
You're growing. You need cash.

00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:18,489
Here's an offer for you.

00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:32,169
NARRATOR: Three sharks are out,
but Kevin seems interested.

00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:34,739
Here's an offer for you.

00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:37,408
I'll lend you $250,000
as debt at 10%,

00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:39,277
which is what
you're paying somebody else,

00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:41,345
and I want...

00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:42,747
30% of the company.

00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:46,017
Plus the debt?
Plus the debt.

00:39:46,017 --> 00:39:47,919
CUBAN:
[ laughs ]
[ groans ]

00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:49,420
Bam!
We're --

00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,455
Well, it's the only offer
you've got.
Boom goes the dynamite.

00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:53,791
It's the only offer
you have.
So, Emily,
three sharks are out.

00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:56,861
You have Mark left,
and Kevin's made you an offer.

00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:59,330
Yeah, guys, I'm concerned
about your management.

00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:02,099
Operational efficiency
is everything for you guys

00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:03,901
when you're
cash-constrained.

00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:07,572
You have $125,000
in inventory,

00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:09,774
and what raises
a management red flag --

00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:12,577
While you still have
this huge amount of inventory,

00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:15,012
you're introducing
more skus.

00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:17,682
We've come this far with
only $300,000 in capital. um --

00:40:17,682 --> 00:40:20,751
No, no, no. don't -- don't
give me the sob story...
I'm not gonna give you
a sob story.

00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,954
...Because it's not about
how much you've raised,

00:40:22,954 --> 00:40:24,822
and it's not
about your sales.
Right.

00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:27,725
It's about how effectively
you've managed your cash...
Right.

00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:30,261
...How effectively have
you managed your inventory.
Right.

00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:33,698
Look, I like the business,
but, operationally,

00:40:33,698 --> 00:40:37,034
cash-management-wise,
there's, you know,

00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:39,003
a truck on the other side
of the tunnel,

00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:40,137
coming straight at you.

00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:42,306
The minute one of these --
You -- retailers says,

00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:44,508
"You need to start
generating demand,"

00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:46,644
or a competitor
comes in the market,

00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:50,114
you're stuck,
and that's a red flag for me,

00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,882
and for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:54,585
Hey, there.

00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:55,920
Hi.

00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,155
All roads lead
back to Mr. Wonderful.

00:40:58,155 --> 00:41:00,958
To Mr. Wonderful.
[ laughs ]

00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,893
What are you gonna do?

00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:05,496
You know, I am the only shark

00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:08,299
that actually graduated with
an environmental-studies degree.

00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,334
Had you done your research,
you would have learned that.

00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:12,470
I am an eco-preneur
for profit,

00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,872
so I think profit
saves the world.

00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:18,509
You're talking to
the only person here who cares.

00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:19,644
[ laughs ]

00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:21,412
I don't think it's
a good deal.

00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:23,214
I think
we can do better.

00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:25,282
So make a counter.

00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:33,624
Well, what -- You know,
what if you did $250,000 in debt

00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:39,096
and an option
for $250,000 at a discount

00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:40,698
when we do
go out and raise money,

00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:42,233
which, inevitably,
we have to do?

00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:43,768
No.

00:41:43,768 --> 00:41:45,970
I'm very good
at helping entrepreneurs,

00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:48,039
but I see no reason
to be flexible here.

00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:50,174
You are about to hit
a brick wall.

00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,743
You both know it.
Well...

00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:55,212
A little more champagne
while you're thinking about it?

00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:59,650
You got to come
to a conclusion.
Right.

00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,820
We think
that we can go out

00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,790
and find an investor
who will support us.

00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:08,125
All right, ladies.
The party's over.

00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:09,160
I'm out.

00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,327
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:11,328
Go get 'em.
Good luck.

00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:12,496
Bye.

00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:14,665
Eh. Blah.

00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:16,567
DOUBILET: We turned
down Kevin's offer

00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:19,003
because we're not willing
to give up so much equity

00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:20,404
at such an early stage.

00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:23,307
We're just gonna keep
living by our motto --

00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:26,310
Respect Earth
and party on.
