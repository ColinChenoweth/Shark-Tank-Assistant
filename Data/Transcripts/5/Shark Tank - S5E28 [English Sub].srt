00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:03,871
NARRATOR:
This is the Shark Tank,
where hopeful entrepreneurs

00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:07,007
get a once-in-a-lifetime chance
to pitch the sharks

00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,976
in hopes
of getting an investment

00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:11,612
to start, grow,
or save their businesses.

00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:12,546
I'm a treasure hunter.

00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:14,515
So your total sales
are at what?

00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:15,249
$1.1 million.

00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:16,717
Oh.
Whoa.
Wow.

00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:18,519
NARRATOR: The entrepreneurs
must convince a shark

00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:21,054
to invest the full amount
they're asking for...

00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:23,223
There's a little, sweet secret
to our cinnamon rolls.

00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:24,057
Here it is.

00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:25,626
No!
JOHN: Whoa.

00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:27,561
NARRATOR: ...Or they'll walk
away with nothing.

00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,930
Sometimes I invest
because it's really cool.

00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,131
But I'm still a shark.

00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,100
So, are you holding firm
at 25%?

00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,769
It doesn't add up for me.
I'm out.

00:00:36,937 --> 00:00:39,740
NARRATOR: If the sharks
hear a great idea...
Wow.

00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,808
You'd have bought
a hundred of these if they
made you look cool, Robert.

00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:43,844
You're
a pretty good salesman.
Maybe I'm a mini-sharkette.

00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:46,947
NARRATOR: ...They're ready to
invest using their own money.

00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:48,949
And they're willing
to fight each other

00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:49,917
for a piece of the action.

00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:51,752
We really like your idea.

00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:53,020
I smell
a counteroffer coming.

00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,822
I'm really contemplating
screwing up Robert's offer.

00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,925
Here comes
a royalty deal.

00:00:57,925 --> 00:00:59,092
Here comes
a bloodsucking offer.

00:00:59,092 --> 00:00:59,860
Silence, please.

00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:04,031
NARRATOR:
Who are the sharks?

00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:07,968
They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors

00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:10,470
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,140
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,576
who turned a $10,000 loan

00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:20,180
into a software business
worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:24,851
Barbara Corcoran went
from waiting tables in Manhattan

00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:28,121
to building the city's
preeminent real-estate empire.

00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:30,557
Daymond John is
a fashion and branding expert

00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:32,593
who grew
his homemade clothing line

00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,862
into the globally recognized
fashion brand Fubu,

00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:39,199
with over $6 billion
in retail sales to date.

00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:42,369
Robert Herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,

00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:45,038
is now a technology mogul

00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:48,775
who sold his first internet
companies for over $350 million.

00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:51,278
And Mark Cuban,

00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:54,514
notorious billionaire
entrepreneur, tech guru,

00:01:54,514 --> 00:02:06,994
and the outspoken owner
of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.

00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:09,763
First into the tank is
an innovative solution

00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:12,265
for the modern
outdoor adventurer.

00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,811
Hello, sharks.
I'm Anton.

00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,147
I'm Roberto.
And I'm ardy.

00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,182
Our company is Oru Kayak,

00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:33,086
and we're here seeking $500,000
for a 12% equity stake.

00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,255
We all love kayaking,

00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:38,258
but we hate all the hassle

00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,726
of storing and transporting
our boats.

00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:42,162
So what if I told you

00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,332
that that kayak
folds out of this?

00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:47,668
Wow.

00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,069
WILLIS: So, a few years ago,

00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:50,437
I set out to design a kayak

00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:53,407
that I could literally store
inside my bedroom closet.

00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:55,008
And to do that, I looked back

00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,211
to an old childhood passion
Of mine -- Origami.

00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:02,949
Wow!
JOHN: Oh.

00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,518
That's pretty clever,
pretty clever.

00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,486
So as you can see, the whole
boat unfolds pretty magically

00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,522
out of a single, seamless sheet,
just like a piece of paper.

00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,891
Now, this material
is extremely durable,

00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:13,427
it's very sturdy,
and it's extremely light.

00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:16,129
The whole boat weighs
only 26 pounds.

00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:20,000
So as you can see, they're
inserting these rigid bulkheads,

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,234
which give the kayak
more structure.

00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:23,870
This orange piece here,

00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,706
which was the lid of the case
when I walked in,

00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,508
now becomes the floorboard
of the kayak that you sit on.

00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:30,277
Well done.

00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:31,411
They're sealing up
the top seams.

00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:32,746
These are the only seams
in the entire boat.

00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:34,347
They're completely watertight,

00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:37,350
so you're gonna stay dry,
even in rough water.

00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,552
So that's a little bit
about how the kayak works.

00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:39,586
I'm gonna hand it to Roberto

00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,388
to talk about what you can do
with it.

00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:44,157
Now, sharks, I'm a former
professional paddler,

00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:46,860
and I've tested this
on flat lakes, big ocean waves,

00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,195
and even
in Whitewater rapids.

00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:50,097
The Oru Kayak is fast
and durable,

00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:52,966
great for an expert-level
paddler like myself,

00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,935
but it's stable,
comfortable, easy to use,

00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:56,503
which is perfect
for beginners.

00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:57,804
I told you a bit
about the boat.

00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,272
Ardy's gonna tell you some more
about the company.

00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,842
In nine months,
we launched the company,

00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:03,076
created a manufacturing line,

00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,312
and are shipping
all around the world.

00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:06,947
Now we need a partner
to help us

00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:09,015
scale up manufacturing
to meet the demand.

00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:13,120
So...Who wants to jump
in the water with us?

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,088
HERJAVEC: Wow.
CORCORAN: Wow.
Remarkable.

00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,057
JOHN: Good, good, good.
Excellent, excellent. Well done.
Well done, guys.

00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,892
Thank you. So seriously,
you guys want to take a try,

00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:20,193
sit in it, lift it up?
HERJAVEC: Yeah, man, yeah.

00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:24,097
So, it's about half
the weight

00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,766
of a comparable plastic
or fiberglass boat.

00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:29,102
And it's
completely watertight?

00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,137
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:31,037
Can I try it?
Yeah.

00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,005
You can hop in.
Please. Yeah.

00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,173
Is it as strong
as fiberglass?

00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:34,207
WILLIS: Pretty strong, yeah.
We'll show you --

00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:36,009
Pretty strong
or as strong?
As strong.

00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,211
There you go.
Get out of my way.

00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,579
GUTIERREZ:
Can we splash him?

00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,381
You got to adjust the footrest
inside there.

00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,016
You can,
just like a regular kayak.
Yeah.

00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:45,352
I-I-I got to tell you,
it feels very, very solid.

00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:48,255
WILLIS: It's pretty comfortable.
Yeah.
I was expecting it
to feel flimsy.

00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,356
Yeah.
Not in the least.

00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:50,724
Yeah, you'd have bought
a hundred of these

00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:51,892
if they made you look cool,
Robert.

00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:53,660
How many have you sold?

00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,263
We sold 1,228.

00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:57,631
Good for you.
At what price?

00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:58,732
$1,100.

00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:00,567
So your total sales
are at what?

00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:02,435
$1.1 million.
Good for you.

00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:05,205
And how have you sold them?
To who and how?

00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:07,607
We sell primarily direct online
right now at our website,

00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,442
and it's going direct
to consumer.

00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,611
What does a typical kayak
sell for?

00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:14,514
For a boat comparable in length,
size, and dimensions,

00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,683
our best-selling boat
in this same range

00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:17,951
sells for about $1,049.

00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,020
So it's roughly
the same price as --

00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,121
About the same
as that, yeah, so...

00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,056
Is there any other collapsible
boat out there?

00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,724
WILLIS: There are a few,
but they're very expensive --

00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:25,792
Usually $4,000 or $5,000.

00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:26,860
They're much heavier,

00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,461
and they're much harder
to put together.

00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,263
What's it cost you
to build one?

00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,598
Right now,
it costs us $505.

00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:32,966
Wow. That's a lot.

00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:35,035
It is a lot, and that's why
we're looking for your money.

00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:37,003
And what do you think is
the lowest you can get it at?

00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,339
We think we can get it to $350
within the next year.

00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,374
Right now it's
quite labor-intensive.

00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:42,576
We're looking to replace

00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:44,010
some of those labor-intensive,
handmade parts

00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,012
through automation, equipment,
and assembly optimization

00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,181
to just get them out
much faster, as well as cheaper.

00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:51,251
HERJAVEC: I'm -- I'm a big
car guy. I-I love design.

00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:54,087
What I find in the car world

00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:57,757
is if you're unique
And -- And more beautiful,

00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,292
there's a price point.
Right.

00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,795
I-I'm struggling
with why aren't people

00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:03,463
willing to pay more for it?

00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:04,898
'cause it's beautiful.

00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,233
We get both questions --

00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:07,868
Why doesn't
this cost $500,

00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,736
and why doesn't
this cost $1,500?

00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:11,171
So what we were trying to do
is appeal

00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:12,505
to the general population,
as well.

00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,808
What's your projection
for next year?

00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:17,878
Projection for next year
is, uh, $4 million in revenue.

00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:25,418
You're gonna go from $1 million
to $4 million?
$1.1 million
to $4 million?

00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,354
Well, we're gonna hit --
By end of the year, we're
gonna hit $1.4 million.

00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:32,058
Guys, I-I'll get things going.
Beautiful, beautiful.

00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,426
I'm not
a big outdoors guy,

00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,362
and I've never been
in a kayak in my life,

00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:37,097
so it's not really
a great fit.

00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:39,332
So for that reason,
I'm out.

00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,635
GUTIERREZ: Okay.
Thank you.

00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:43,837
The -- The big issue
with this deal is

00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,372
I don't think 500k is enough

00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:47,574
to automate
the manufacturing process.

00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:50,176
Some of the equipment you need
is very expensive.

00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:53,947
It's -- It's an interesting
product, but to me,

00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:56,917
I-it's not developed enough
on a manufacturing and
logistics point of view

00:06:56,917 --> 00:07:01,087
to know how this thing scales
and how fast it can scale.

00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,089
For that reason, I'm out.

00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,492
Thank you very much.
Thank you for your time.

00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:07,294
I'm challenged with this,
'cause I love it,

00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:08,762
and I want to give you
the money.

00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:13,600
I just -- The unknown
is the manufacturing.

00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,568
See, in my business, we're
really on tight margins.

00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:16,736
Mm-hmm.
Right.

00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:18,538
So if we can save 25 cents
on a pair of jeans,

00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,273
we'll fly around the world
to do that, right?

00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,675
Right. Right, right.
Right. Right.

00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:23,610
So it's a touch too early,
and I can't help you with this.

00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,314
And I'm -- I'm kicking myself,
but I'm out.

00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:30,417
I'm not trying to push it,

00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:33,520
but I would say I think
we've done a pretty amazing job

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,689
of getting this up -- the
manufacturing off the ground

00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:37,390
from scratch, you know,
from a prototype.

00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,893
Dealing with it
at a $1 million business

00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:42,195
and dealing with it
at a $20 million business...
Of course. Mm-hmm.

00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:45,432
...is night and day.

00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:48,768
You know, I own two kayaks
that I never use. I mean...

00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,103
[ laughter ]

00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:52,339
But for some reason,
I'm dying to have this kayak.

00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:53,473
I think it's like
a status symbol.

00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,141
I really want to show off
about it.

00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,443
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Yeah, yeah.

00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:57,777
CORCORAN: And I think
that's half the sale.

00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:00,146
It really is.
It's sexy and cool.
Yeah.

00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,282
But here's the rub -- I love to
get involved with my businesses

00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:03,850
and help them
however I can...
WILLIS: Mm-hmm.

00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,318
...Other than investing
the money.

00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,687
I can't imagine what I could do
With -- With this. I'm out.

00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,291
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you very much,
yeah.

00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:15,595
Robert?

00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,831
And the only
adventure-loving guy here.

00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:18,932
Ah.
[ laughs ]

00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:20,467
Adventure-
and design-loving guy.

00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:25,171
Definitely a customer.

00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,741
Lot of risk
on the manufacturing side.

00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,376
I think Daymond's right.

00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:33,279
But I think you have a lot of
unanswered questions out there.

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,547
But, I got to tell you,
I-I made an investment

00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:35,915
in a product that I just thought
was really cool --

00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:38,385
Chordbuddy --
And we did great on it.

00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:41,755
So sometimes I invest because,
you know, I'm a shark...
Mm-hmm.

00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:44,657
...And I want my money back,
And it's "grrr!"
mm-hmm.

00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:45,992
And sometimes I just think
it's really cool.
Yeah.
Right.

00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,394
But I'm still a shark.

00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,295
GUTIERREZ: Right.
Right.

00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,965
$500,000 for 25%.

00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,269
That's cutting
your valuation in half.

00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:08,848
NARRATOR:
Four sharks are out.

00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:13,119
Oru kayak has an offer
on the table from Robert.

00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,789
$500,000 for 25%.

00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,892
That's cutting
your valuation in half.

00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:26,533
25%. All right.

00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:29,035
So, Robert, we really love
your enthusiasm,

00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,805
and we've always wanted
to have people involved

00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:34,107
who really understand
the design behind this

00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:36,843
on the brand value that we've --
We've -- We've created.

00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:40,280
What do you think about 15%,
a-a seat on the board,

00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,083
and we can do due diligence,
get you out to the factory?

00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,251
Of course I'm going to get
a seat on the board, number one.

00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,653
GUTIERREZ: Right.

00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,621
Of course we're gonna go see
the factory,

00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:51,091
and of course I'm gonna bring in
people that I trust,

00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,293
that manufacture other things,
to help you guys.
Mm-hmm.

00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:55,762
I-I'm not sure any
Of that stuff changes it. I-I --

00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,197
So are you holding f-firm
at 25%,

00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:58,298
or do you have room to move?

00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:03,803
That's my offer. I-I'm not
interested in a counter at 15%.

00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,572
Okay.

00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:06,940
What are you gonna do?

00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:15,081
All right.
So, Robert, would you take 20%?

00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,151
[ laughs ]

00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,487
No.

00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:25,125
I-I -- You know, guys,
if it's worth --

00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,526
If it's worth it to you
at 20%,

00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:28,728
it's worth it to you at 25%.

00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,163
$500,000 is a lot of money.

00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:32,332
JOHN: Yeah.
That -- That's my offer.

00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:35,502
I'm not trying to, you know,
negotiate you out of it.
I know.

00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:37,003
That's the offer I feel
comfortable with.

00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:41,107
Let's do it.
All right.

00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,743
Well...

00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:48,348
...we'd love to have you.

00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:49,582
O'LEARY: Oh!
All right! Wow!

00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,951
All right!
Excellent!

00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,620
CUBAN:
Score one for the Robert.
Thanks, guys.

00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,389
Yeah! Nice job.
Thank you. Thank you
very much. thank you.

00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,224
Good job, guys. Well done.
Thank you.

00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:01,594
CUBAN: Great product.
Great product.
Well presented.
Thank you.

00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:02,795
Good job, Robert.

00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,899
WILLIS:
We're pretty excited.

00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,767
It feels like great validation

00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,569
to just have Robert love
the product so much

00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:12,172
and really have that
be the guiding force
behind his decision.

00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,913
NARRATOR: In season 4,
Sabin lomac and Jim Tselikis

00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:22,749
made a deal with Barbara
for their food-truck business,

00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,451
Cousins Maine Lobster.

00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,253
$55,000 for 15%.

00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,589
Barbara,
welcome to the family.
Thank you.

00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:30,723
Come on over here.
Come bring it here.

00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,492
NARRATOR: Let's see
what they're up to now.

00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:34,761
When we first came
on "Shark Tank,"

00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,329
we had $150,000 in sales.

00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:39,332
On our last update,
we had $700,000.

00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:40,900
And now,
just a year later,

00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,736
we're approaching
$3.5 million in sales.

00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:46,105
What's cooking?
30 new applicants in Seattle.

00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,074
When we started out,
it was our goal

00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:50,610
to be the name and the face
of Maine lobster.

00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,045
Right now we're taking
that step

00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,713
with franchising
our trucks nationwide.

00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,950
We are here today to deliver
our first truck

00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,718
to our first
franchisee, Gil.

00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,453
He loved our concept
and brand

00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,188
and plans on taking the truck
to Phoenix, Arizona.

00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,624
We have
a little surprise, too.
I'm excited. What?

00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:06,993
[ horn honking ]
Look at this.

00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:09,028
Hey, guys!

00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,930
Barbara has always believed
that franchising our business

00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,265
is the way
that we're gonna make it.

00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:13,466
Wow.
Welcome aboard.

00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:14,801
Running
a successful business

00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,603
isn't just about keeping
all your profits and money.

00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:17,637
It's about giving back.

00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:19,772
So we created
our own foundation,

00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,007
called Cousins for a Cause.

00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:22,675
Welcome to Big Brothers
Big Sisters.

00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,477
LOMAC: We chose Big Brothers
Big Sisters

00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:25,712
to share
our profits with

00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:27,280
because of
the personal connection

00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,948
that I have
with their organization.

00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,617
I was a little brother
growing up,

00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,418
so the foundation means
a lot to me.

00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,488
It was such a huge part
of my life growing up,

00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,290
and now I have a little brother
named Lawrence.

00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,591
LOMAC: What kind of theorem
is that?

00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,293
Pythagorean theorem.
Phew! Boom!

00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:43,162
Now I get to hopefully send him
in the right direction,

00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:44,931
just like my Big Brother
did for me.

00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,065
Whoo!

00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:47,634
CORCORAN: These guys are
tomorrow's billionaires.

00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:48,968
And more important than that,

00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,370
they're gonna be
happy billionaires

00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,804
because they know
how to give back.

00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,774
What we have here
are two great entrepreneurs

00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,243
that are giving back
and making a ton of money.

00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,645
I mean, this is
the American dream.

00:12:58,645 --> 00:12:59,846
Here we come, Phoenix.

00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:01,981
We are so lucky to have made
a deal with Barbara.

00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,117
Bottom line is,
she cares.

00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:07,687
She's a part of our family,
and now we're a part of hers.

00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:19,198
My name is Jayla Siciliano.

00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:20,900
I'm from Solana Beach,
California,

00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,435
and I'm the owner
of Bon Affair.

00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:25,038
California is the perfect place
to start my business,

00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:27,040
'cause it's the hub
of America's wine country,

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,941
and it's also the hub
of health and fitness,

00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:31,644
which are two key aspects
to my product.

00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,079
Cheers.
Cheers.

00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:35,515
My past career involved
a lot of business trips

00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:37,583
where there was a lot
of wining and dining,

00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,653
and I needed something that
wouldn't pack on the calories

00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,256
and wouldn't leave me feeling
groggy the next morning.

00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:46,326
We have the sauvignon blanc
and the syrah.

00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,461
Currently, my business
is a grind.

00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:49,696
I'm doing everything

00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:53,833
from store deliveries
to managing the website,

00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,468
and it's really tough
to compete

00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:57,470
with the big alcohol companies
out there.

00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,971
We have the capacity to do

00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,107
up to 10,000 cases
a month for you.

00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:03,176
I've pretty much risked
everything

00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,510
to start this business.

00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,746
I quit my job,
I cashed in my 401(k),

00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:10,149
ran up credit cards, and I even
went back to bartending nights

00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,651
so I could work during the day.

00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:13,386
If I don't get a deal
from the sharks,

00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:15,288
I honestly don't know
what's gonna happen.

00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:16,556
We're running out of money,

00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:18,358
and we're looking
at possibly having

00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,059
to close the doors
in a few months

00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,494
if I don't get this investment,

00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:23,629
so I have everything
on the line right now.

00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,044
Hi, sharks.

00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,213
My name is Jayla Siciliano,

00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,181
and I'm the founder
of Bon Affair.

00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:47,220
I'm looking for $150,000
for 35% of my company.

00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,256
Okay, now, I'm gonna guess
that most of you sharks

00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:53,559
like to drink wine
and also care about your health.

00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,828
I'm one
of over 50 million Americans

00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:58,598
who feels the same way,
and in my past career,

00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:01,000
there were tons of dinners
and parties.

00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,435
And I love to have fun,

00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:05,238
but I couldn't afford to wake up
feeling groggy in the morning,

00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:08,875
so I started adding soda water
to my wine.

00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,476
But I found I could
socialize longer

00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,245
and I would feel better
the next morning,

00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,746
and that's when it hit me.

00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,982
I knew this was needed
on the market,

00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:18,618
so I quit my job,
and I decided to go for it,

00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:20,353
and that's when Bon Affair
was born.

00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:24,757
Bon affair is
the first premium wine spritzer

00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:28,194
with California wine,
purified sparkling water,

00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:29,495
and electrolytes,

00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:33,566
with zero added sugar
and 6.5% alcohol.

00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:35,201
I'd love to give you
some samples,

00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:36,636
and I want to remind you

00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:39,939
that this is not a replacement
for a full-bodied glass of wine.

00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,174
This is a lighter alternative.

00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:44,777
Think of it as the best
sparkling water ever,

00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,479
'cause it has wine in it.

00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:48,881
Are -- Are you okay
with that?
Thank you. Yeah.

00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,417
CORCORAN: Thank you.

00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,488
Cheers, Barbara.
To you.
Thank you. [ chuckles ]

00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:56,456
whoa.
Thank you, thank you.

00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:57,256
You're very welcome.

00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,091
Toast. Kev.

00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:00,560
Cheers.

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,861
HERJAVEC: Jayla,
if I ordered

00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:04,297
a normal glass
of red wine,

00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,531
your product,
how many calories?

00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:08,968
So, this has half the calories
of regular wine.

00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,037
What is the purpose of the
electrolytes that you mentioned?

00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:13,439
You know, we make no claims.

00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,308
It's alcohol.
It's not wheatgrass.

00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,577
So we always say
the electrolytes are in there

00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,979
'cause why not?
[ laughs ]

00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,815
And from personal experience,
I find that they do help,

00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,283
but interesting enough --

00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:26,752
But help with what? I'm not sure
I understand the concept.

00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:29,555
Um, countering the negative
effects of alcohol.

00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:30,823
Less of a hangover.
Yeah.

00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,325
Griffith University
in Australia

00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:35,261
actually just did a study
at their health institute

00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:37,697
on how electrolytes
added to beer

00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:40,933
actually do hydrate you
more than regular beer.

00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,969
Have you drank enough to really
test the -- the hypothesis?

00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:44,537
I have.

00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:47,073
Is anybody up here
a wine spritzer drinker?
'cause I'm not.

00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:48,541
I am. Yeah.
How does it compare?

00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,744
Um, it feels -- It tastes to me
less sweet than a spritzer.

00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,813
Do men ever drink a spritzer?
I associate it with a woman.

00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:55,181
Yeah, they do.
In the summertime --

00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,249
No, they don't.
Yeah.

00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:57,650
Yes, they do.
In the summertime, a rosé.

00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:00,052
SICILIANO: They do.
Do they?
[ deep voice ]
Not real men.

00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:02,455
Rosé wine with, um --
With ice in it

00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:04,590
started in the South
of France in Saint-Tropez

00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,725
back in the '50s.

00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:07,493
It's now extremely popular
in North America.

00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:10,062
Jayla, who is
the target customer?

00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:13,266
So, the target customer
is a woman

00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:16,102
who has a really busy
either career or she's a mom,

00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:18,671
she likes to drink wine
at least a few days a week,

00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:21,541
but she has to wake up
super early the next morning.

00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,709
So she can drink your product,
not get a hangover.

00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,545
She feels better
the next day,

00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,180
but she's comfortable
in a social setting.

00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,515
Yeah, it's kind of that
guilt-free option.

00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,117
This is kind of like a skinny
margarita alternative, right?

00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:32,051
Yep.

00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,487
Right now we're selling

00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:37,123
in 10 Whole Foods
from L.A. to San Diego.

00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:38,424
We just went
into our first Albertsons.

00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:39,992
We're approved to go
into three more Whole Foods,

00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,460
and we're approved
for five more Albertsons.

00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,563
Because you only have clearance
in California at this point.

00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:44,964
Yeah.

00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:46,732
And how much have you been
selling in those stores?

00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,535
Um, we've sold about $11,000
in the last six weeks.

00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,604
We just launched it.

00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:52,638
[ groans ]

00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,707
Oh, just --
This is brand-new.

00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:55,875
You're six weeks old.

00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:56,676
Brand-new.

00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,844
Did you design this bottle?

00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:01,180
I think -- I wouldn't mind
having a closer look.

00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,848
But it's very elegant.
SICILIANO:
Do you want to see?

00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,283
Is that your background?
Are you a designer of some sort?

00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,953
Yeah, I did product development
and design

00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:09,322
for footwear and bags
for seven years.
Thank you.

00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:11,724
Looks very feminine.
HERJAVEC: Jayla, how much money
did you put into this?

00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:14,860
I've personally
put in $30,000.

00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:19,231
As I said, I quit my job,
and I've been doing

00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,200
everything I possibly could
to make ends meet.

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,268
I went back to bartending.

00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,904
And when I had
no resources left,

00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:27,506
I ended up going out
and pitching investors.

00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:28,708
Did you get
any investors?

00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:31,344
I did.
I ended up getting $450,000.

00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:33,145
Oh.
Whoa.
Wow.

00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:34,313
From who?
From?

00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:36,782
And we -- Um,
from two private investors

00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,384
that I didn't know
beforehand.

00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:42,221
Um, I got a $2.61 million
valuation on that first round.

00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:43,389
[ laughs ]

00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:45,424
I did. Hey.
You're
a pretty good salesman.

00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,126
Maybe I'm a mini-sharkette.
No kidding.

00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,327
[ laughs ]

00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:51,664
And today you're asking
$150,000 for 35%.

00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:55,134
So you're diluting
your original shareholders.

00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,636
The whole company believes

00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,338
a partnership with you guys
would be worth it.

00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:02,141
Wow.

00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,510
You -- You've run
out of money.

00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,612
SICILIANO:
Let me explain what happened.

00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,881
So basically,
we got that $450,000.

00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,117
It was off to the races.
Let's go.

00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:12,818
I had a bottler in Michigan

00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,655
who had a really great
reputation at the time.

00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,056
They bottled for --
Something must have
gone wrong.

00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:18,891
It did.
It went very, very wrong.

00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,259
Our initial production run,

00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:22,495
we lost about 90% of it
due to leaky caps.

00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,498
Why did it leak?

00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,700
SICILIANO: They basically didn't
put them on there correctly.

00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,102
It was very devastating,
obviously.

00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,738
After all that,
our existing investors

00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:35,074
actually put in
another $150,000.

00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:37,343
How much money was lost
in that little faux pas?

00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,879
We lost over $100,000
worth of inventory.

00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,715
Oh!

00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:44,116
So when they put in
another $150,000,

00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,752
the -- the total
is still $450,000?

00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:49,922
No, the total to date
is $700,000,

00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,524
so they put in more,
our existing investors.
Whoa.

00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,826
Our goal is to grow this.

00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:55,761
We think there's potential for
an acquisition down the road.

00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,863
You look at all the
coconut waters that
have been acquired...

00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,700
[ laughs ] 'cause it's just
like coconut water, right?
...Skinnygirl margarita.

00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,935
O'LEARY: Got to get
to $10 million.
Yeah, we'll --

00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,470
$10 million in sales
to acquire.
I agree, yeah. Coconut water
wasn't there before.

00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,238
I think this is
an amazing category.

00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:07,740
It's just
the amount of money

00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,343
you're -- that you're gonna
need for this is massive.
Jayla --

00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,045
Well, there's lots
of beverages have --

00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,914
That have grown out
their grassroots style.

00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:17,283
And the benefit -- I mean,
we saw skinnygirl margarita

00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:19,251
pave the path
for the low-calorie, but --

00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,187
Very, very, very rare.

00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:23,289
Hpnotiq, skinnygirl --
Very rare.

00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:25,725
She had hundreds
of hours of television,

00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,661
and she really hit a certain
audience that didn't expect it.

00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:30,563
You can't touch this market

00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,665
without even $5 million
to get started.

00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:35,234
I know this journey --
Very, very hard,

00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,237
and I've already lost my shirt
on one deal like this.

00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,072
Daymond, you can help me
get those endorsers, though.

00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,373
I-I couldn't help
myself.

00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:42,441
Yeah.

00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,176
I'm out.

00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:45,377
Okay.

00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:47,747
I don't understand

00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:52,485
how you raised $700,000
from investors

00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:55,488
for a value
Of $2.6 million,

00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:59,792
and now, because I'm a wonderful
human being and a shark,

00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:03,295
I get a value of $420,000
for the company.

00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,064
Well, I know our sales
are low.

00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:07,700
It doesn't add up for me.
It doesn't add up for me.

00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:12,271
It tells me that perhaps
there's bigger challenges.

00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,539
I'm out.

00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:14,473
Okay. Thank you.

00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,408
Jayla, who is
the number-one buyer

00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:18,043
of wine in this country
on Earth?

00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:19,512
Women?

00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:21,013
No. Costco.

00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,615
Oh. Costco, yeah.
Of course.

00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,016
So, west
of the Mississippi,

00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,484
there's one buyer
right here in California.
Mm-hmm.

00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:26,452
Why don't you
go see her?

00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,120
Costco? I would love to.
Yeah.

00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,755
It took me a year to
get into Whole Foods,
and you guys could --

00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:31,757
And she might listen to your
story and give you a test,

00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:34,193
and it's only one buyer

00:21:34,193 --> 00:21:35,861
for the largest buyer of wine
on Earth,

00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:36,996
just one phone call.

00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:38,964
No, I'm not opposed
To it at all. I think --

00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,266
Kevin, are you gonna marry her
or make her an offer?

00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:41,967
No, but I-I'm trying
to help her...

00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,035
SICILIANO: Yeah.
...Because I'm in her business,
but I understand --

00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:44,036
I think you could help me
get that meeting.

00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:45,838
No, I know, but I-it's --
You know,

00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:48,073
you're in --
You're in a difficult situation,

00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:50,543
because you've taken down
a lot of investor dollars

00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:53,579
to try and build a whole new
category in the wine business.

00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:55,915
But I think you've got a lot --
A tough road ahead.

00:21:55,915 --> 00:21:57,583
That's exactly
what you should do.

00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:00,419
And I never give advice,
but I know this space very well.

00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:03,088
Go do that, and good luck
to you. I'm out.

00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:07,426
I am amazed
that you were able

00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:09,628
to raise $700,000
from your investors.

00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:11,030
It wasn't easy.
CORCORAN: Right.

00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,698
You're an amazing salesperson,
truly,

00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,600
but I really think you have
a double sell --

00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,770
Sell the category,
sell the brand.

00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:20,039
And I think it's gonna be
a heck of a long haul,

00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,274
and it's gonna take
so much more money,

00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:24,443
and I'm just not willing
to put that money in.

00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:25,477
I'm out.

00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:27,546
Okay.

00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:35,120
Mark, I have put everything
I have into this.

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,190
I am laser-focused.
I am 100% dedicated.

00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,927
I'm the most resourceful person
you'll come across.

00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:43,896
What's the one thing
you need?

00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:46,265
The one thing I need --
Exposure and contacts.

00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:48,968
It took me, as I said, a year
to get into Whole Foods.

00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:50,669
I know I'll get
a distributor.

00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:53,639
I know I could get into Costco
if I really try.

00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:57,476
But I know that with your help,
I could get there a lot faster.

00:22:57,476 --> 00:23:00,746
Okay. I like you.

00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:05,184
Um, I'm not an expert
in the wine business,

00:23:05,184 --> 00:23:07,286
but I like the category.

00:23:07,286 --> 00:23:08,621
I'll make you an offer.

00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:14,360
I'll offer you
the $150,000...

00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:18,297
...for 35%.

00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,934
[ laughs ]

00:23:21,934 --> 00:23:23,035
Mark, I will take it.

00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:25,671
You are
a tough negotiator.

00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:27,172
I am.
I'm tough as hell.

00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:28,440
Thank you so much.
No problem. My pleasure.

00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,676
I'm excited. My -- My wife
would love it, too.

00:23:30,676 --> 00:23:33,178
I-I don't think Mark gets
The concept of "Shark Tank."

00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:34,079
[ laughs ]

00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,214
You take
small businesses,

00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:36,749
and you make them
into big businesses.

00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,450
That's the concept
of "Shark Tank," right?

00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,885
You're so tough, Mark.

00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:41,553
Thank you very much.
Thank you, all. Appreciate it.

00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:43,355
Good luck.
Congratulations.

00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:45,925
Being here today,
getting this opportunity,

00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:48,594
and then getting a deal
with Mark makes me realize

00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:51,497
every single day, every tear,
every struggle

00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:53,198
has been totally worth it.

00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:55,000
JOHN: You're gonna regret
that one, man.
We'll find out, right?

00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,671
It's not like I'm spending
$10 million just as an option
on a big business.

00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:00,739
If it works,
it's worth a lot of money.

00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:03,075
If it doesn't,
I'm out time and 150k.

00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:04,977
So the risk/reward
is enormous.

00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:07,780
You know what?
Worst case, my wife gives
these away at Christmas.

00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,050
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
You're -- You're gonna have a
garage full of those things.

00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,485
I know what we're getting
from Mark for Christmas, guys.

00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:15,287
Bon Affair!

00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:28,767
NARRATOR:
Next up is a treasure hunter

00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:31,403
with a unique opportunity
for the sharks.

00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:40,112
Ahoy, sharks.
My name is Mark Hargitt.

00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:41,480
Okay, sharks,
here is the scuttlebutt.

00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,317
I'm a treasure hunter,
and I found treasure.

00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:49,621
I found 1,200 tons
of copper, silver, and gold ore

00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:52,024
sitting in the belly
of the Mariposa,

00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:54,793
a ship that sank
almost a hundred years ago

00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:56,428
just off the coast of Alaska.

00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58,364
Let me take you there.

00:24:58,364 --> 00:24:59,531
Wow.

00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:05,037
As you can see,
there's a lot of kelp.

00:25:05,037 --> 00:25:07,973
Pretty strong currents.

00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:09,942
Going down the anchor line.

00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:12,411
Got to hang on, because
the current will sweep you away.

00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:15,114
And here's a steam valve.

00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:19,451
You can see there's
a lot more artifacts.

00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:22,588
Here's one of the fire bricks
from the boiler.

00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:27,559
Wow. Very cool.

00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,228
What was so cool
about that, Rob?

00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:31,063
I just love diving
and treasure and --

00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:32,598
That could have been a car
in the Hudson river.

00:25:32,598 --> 00:25:34,466
[ laughter ]

00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:36,135
So, Mark,
what is your offer?

00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:40,472
I need $250,000 for 25%
of my business.

00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:43,308
What do we get for that,
Mark?

00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:48,180
Well, you'll get 25%
of, um, the booty.

00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,282
The booty being that ore, the
rocks we were looking at there?

00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:52,484
Well, there's more than that.
There is artifacts.

00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:55,454
The wholesale value of the ore
I estimate

00:25:55,454 --> 00:25:57,423
at around $2.4 million

00:25:57,423 --> 00:26:01,693
if I can gather it all,
if I get the right equipment.

00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:03,896
Mark, how did you find
the treasure?

00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:06,365
Well, research
is the key there.

00:26:06,365 --> 00:26:08,901
I'm a nautical
amateur historian.

00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,502
I grew up
in the marine industry.

00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:12,771
I'm the seventh son
of a seventh son

00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:14,239
of a son of a son of a sailor.

00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,808
Are you the only person
that knows

00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:17,409
the GPS coordinates
of where it is?

00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,044
Oh, heck no.
This is a well-known wreck.

00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:21,313
Oh, it is?
Yeah, so why -- Yeah, so why
hasn't it been salvaged before?

00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:22,281
Well, it has.

00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:24,750
What gives you
the rights to it, Mark?

00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,985
Well, I filed a claim
with the state of Alaska,

00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:29,088
basically a mineral claim.

00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:32,558
If it's been salvaged before,
how do we know with certainty
that the ore is still there?

00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:33,659
Here it is.

00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:34,993
What's that?
What's that?

00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:36,762
Come and look.
CORCORAN: Scared me
when you opened that.

00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,163
Now, hold your breath.
I got some gloves here.

00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:39,298
Oh!

00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:41,100
This came --
Just came off the seafloor.

00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,234
O'LEARY:
This is the ore?

00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:43,335
No. This is
actually copper matte.

00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:44,436
CORCORAN:
Phew! It stinks.

00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,471
This is ore.

00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:47,005
HERJAVEC: Why does it smell
so bad, Mark?

00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:49,208
Well, because it was underwater
a few days ago.

00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:52,111
Some of this is ore
that hasn't been smelted,

00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:53,345
and some of this
already has.

00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,980
What does that mean --
Smelted?

00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,015
That means
it's concentrated.
So it's denser,
it's denser.

00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:59,118
HERJAVEC:
So, Mark, let's say --
This is actually
a copper concentrate.

00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,385
So you're assuming

00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:04,323
there is "x" amount
of mineral down there?

00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:06,925
Where else would it go?
Other people.

00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:08,494
Plenty of things could have
Salvaged -- Other people
could have salvaged it.

00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:10,129
Yes, they have, but they've
picked the cherries off.

00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,131
They've gotten, like,
the ship's wheel,

00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,832
and the whistle,
and propellers.

00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:16,668
But do you think
the entire 1,200 tons
is still down there?

00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:18,837
I don't see any reason
why not.

00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,606
And how much
have you salvaged,

00:27:20,606 --> 00:27:23,008
and what type of dollars
has that turned into?

00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,844
Well, we have just salvaged
a few hundred pounds so far,

00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:27,679
because we were doing it
by hand.

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,381
If I get three-quarters of it,

00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:33,752
I'm thinking around
$2.4 million wholesale.

00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:38,257
How long would it take to
salvage the entire mother lode?

00:27:38,257 --> 00:27:40,459
I know with the eductor system
I want to build --

00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:42,361
It's basically like
an underwater vacuum cleaner --

00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:45,030
It would take about a week,
maybe two.

00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:48,000
That's it? You could have
the entire mother lode up?

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,368
Well, that's
just a rough estimate.

00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:50,903
What do you need
the money for?

00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:54,773
Well, I need, uh,
equipment, crew.

00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:57,543
Um, I need to build
an eductor system,

00:27:57,543 --> 00:27:59,845
rent a barge, uh...

00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:02,047
Sounds like you have
the equipment, though.
...Lawyers,
guns, shark repellent,

00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:03,815
'cause there's real sharks
that swim around.
Sharks?

00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:06,351
Yeah. There's real ones
that swim around.

00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:09,288
O'LEARY: Okay, so, Mark,
if I want to invest

00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:11,924
in treasure hunting,
there's many guys I can go to.

00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:13,525
I'm gonna make that assumption.

00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,893
O'LEARY: There's lots
of competitors.
Mm-hmm.

00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,061
If I just started
to do my due diligence,

00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:18,864
why am I picking you?

00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:21,200
Well, because I'm the captain.
I'll do this operation.

00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,734
I've been in salvage
all my life,

00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:24,970
21 years
in the merchant marines.

00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,639
I've saved ships.
I've had my life saved.

00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,541
I've saved others.

00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,844
This is, uh -- I'm the guy.
I can do this for you.

00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:34,846
Good for you, Mark.
CORCORAN: Isn't there someone
in your industry

00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:36,715
that you could easily go to
and get the money?

00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,517
You're well known.
You have the experience.

00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:41,720
Well, that is true.
You guys are plan "c," actually.

00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,089
Plan "c"?
[ laughter ]

00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:45,757
It's good
to know we're loved.

00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:47,426
Well, plan "a"
is to do it by hand.

00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:49,328
Plan "b" was to take
my early retirement.

00:28:49,328 --> 00:28:51,863
I have half a million
in a retirement account.

00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:53,865
Let me -- Let me just ask
this question.

00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:54,967
You have the rights

00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:56,702
for the minerals
on this ship, correct?

00:28:56,702 --> 00:28:59,071
It was granted
exclusive --
Mineral rights, yes.

00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:02,074
It was granted
exclusively to you,

00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:04,443
which means you're the only one
who can go down there,

00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:06,578
bring it up,
and sell it.

00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,981
Since you have
the exclusive rights,

00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:12,517
could you not simply take
your rights,

00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:14,820
go to
a big salvage company,

00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,256
and sell
your rights to them?

00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,758
I hadn't thought of that.
Yeah, I could.

00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,927
Welcome to
the Shark Tank.
Yes, yes. Great idea.

00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:24,196
Mark, I get pitched this
all the time --

00:29:24,196 --> 00:29:25,797
This treasure,
that treasure.

00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:27,065
Everybody e-mail --

00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:28,500
You do?
Do you really, Mark?
Oh, yeah. All the time.

00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,003
There goes my lunch meeting
with you.
Oh, yeah. [ laughs ]

00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:32,871
I've been pitched a lot
of treasure hunts.

00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:34,306
Everybody talks
a grand plan,

00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:36,341
but they never turn out
the way they project.

00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:38,110
There's just too much risk
here, Mark.

00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,878
I like you.
I like what you're doing.

00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:41,913
You're a great guy.
But I'm out.

00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:45,884
I'm falling in love with
the romance of the idea --

00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:47,886
You know, diving deep,
salmon boats.

00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:50,389
You know, maybe I get
into this investment,

00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:52,591
I get my own patch
over my eye and --

00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:54,393
Talk like a pirate?
Yeah.
And hang out with you.

00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:56,695
Well, I do want you
to go diving on it with me.

00:29:56,695 --> 00:29:58,997
I wouldn't have the slightest
idea what you're telling me

00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:00,899
or what you're doing or --
I couldn't even advise.

00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:03,602
I just -- I can't be of any help
here. I'm sorry. I'm out.

00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:06,438
Well, you want to forget
about the money and just
sign on as crew?

00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:07,739
There you go.
[ laughter ]

00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:09,207
HERJAVEC: Like Daymond,
I love the water.

00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:11,443
I love cars,
but I really love boats.

00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:15,814
I've been a diver since I was
16 years old, padi certified.

00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,150
In fact, I ran away from home
when I was 17.

00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,918
I wanted to join the navy.
True story.

00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:23,488
So I love it. Love diving.
Love everything about it.

00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,123
Well, this is your chance
to go and take it

00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:27,459
to the most moneymaking
adventure you've ever had

00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:28,593
walk through these doors.

00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:31,096
Arrr!
That's right.

00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:34,733
But this really isn't
an investment today

00:30:34,733 --> 00:30:37,402
I-I-in the kind where I can see
getting a return.

00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,805
I'm out. Thank you
for coming here, though.

00:30:39,805 --> 00:30:41,473
You bet.

00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:42,808
CORCORAN: You know what the deal
lacks for me?

00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:45,410
First of all, knowledge.
I have no knowledge of this.

00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,778
I have to totally trust you.

00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:48,647
When has that
ever stopped you before?

00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:50,949
Yeah. But you know what?
It lacks the sex appeal.

00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:53,051
I was hoping when you opened
that big box,

00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:55,220
I was gonna see crown jewels,
some diamonds.

00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,856
Well, it doesn't look like
a treasure chest. that's true.

00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:01,293
CORCORAN: Somehow, seeing those
rocks just didn't do it for me.

00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:03,595
I'm out. I just wish
it had more sex appeal.

00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:09,568
I think that the only person
that's left is...Kevin.

00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:13,305
O'LEARY: Very interesting.

00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:14,740
First time we ever had

00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,007
someone like you
in the Shark Tank.

00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:19,211
I think there's
lots of risk in this.

00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,046
It's, uh,
not a slam dunk at all.

00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:23,315
It's just very expensive
to get it out.

00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:25,050
No, not really.

00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,718
Well, we don't know that yet.
Anyways, I --

00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,220
Well, the system
that I want to use

00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,690
is basically like an underwater
vacuum cleaner, an eductor.

00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:35,660
I-I-I've actually seen it work
On a -- On a Roman ship

00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,063
off the coast of Cyprus
that I got involved in,

00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:41,032
and it's a long story,

00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:42,701
but that ship now sits
in kyrenia castle.

00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:45,303
It's very expensive. It takes
a lot longer than you think.

00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:47,572
And that's in warm water
in the Mediterranean.

00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,274
Here's the thing --
Once you start, you can't stop.

00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:50,475
You got to finish it.

00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:53,412
Otherwise, the whole
investment's worthless.

00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:55,647
So, look, I'm not gonna take
the dive with you.

00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:57,349
Good luck to you. I'm out.

00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:59,251
Okay.

00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:02,421
Good luck
with the treasure, Mark.

00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:05,490
You bet. Thanks.

00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,860
Well, you know, we've never had
an investment here

00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,896
where one of the risk
is real sharks.

00:32:10,896 --> 00:32:13,732
Do you know why they haven't
actually done that?

00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:15,767
Because the cost
of taking it out is gonna
be more than $2 million.

00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,670
That isn't cheap.
I mean, it's --
It's really expensive.

00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:32,150
NARRATOR:
Next into the tank is a couple

00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,753
with a twist
on a decadent dessert.

00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,929
And my name
is Shannon Radke.

00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:45,797
Thank you so much
for having us.

00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,632
We're super excited
to be here.

00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,302
Our company
is called Cinnaholic,

00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:53,104
and we're looking
for a $200,000 investment

00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:55,340
in return for 20%
of our company.

00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:59,044
My background
in brand marketing

00:32:59,044 --> 00:33:01,213
and with s-Shannon's talent
for baking,

00:33:01,213 --> 00:33:04,716
we created the world's
best cinnamon-roll experience.

00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:06,685
At Cinnaholic,

00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:08,587
it's all about custom,
gourmet cinnamon rolls.

00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:11,289
We start you off
with a fresh cinnamon roll

00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:13,625
right out of the oven,
and then you can choose

00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:15,594
from over 30 different
frosting flavors

00:33:15,594 --> 00:33:17,128
and 30 different toppings

00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:20,699
and create your own
very unique cinnamon roll.

00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:23,034
Today, we have a couple rolls
prepared for you.

00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,436
We're always hungry.

00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:25,704
What do we have here?

00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:31,309
So, for Robert, we're making
caramel banana cream pie.

00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:34,412
You are speaking
my language, Shannon.

00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:36,381
Thank you very much.
There you go.

00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:38,383
And for Barbara, we're doing
our mocha almond roll.

00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:40,285
Thank you very much.
There you go.

00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:42,754
And for Kevin, we have
our classic old-school roll.

00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:46,725
Oh!
It's vanilla frosting
with strawberry.

00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:48,460
Shannon,
it's incredible.

00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,095
Yay! Thank you!

00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:55,300
And for Daymond, we are doing
our coffee cookie dough.

00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,535
Wow!
Our cookie is
made in-house.

00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:57,736
HERJAVEC: Mmm.
Isn't that amazing?

00:33:57,736 --> 00:33:59,404
Bless me, Florian. Bless me.
Thank you.

00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:01,907
Wow.
SHANNON:
And for Mark,

00:34:01,907 --> 00:34:04,009
we have
our almond raspberry.

00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:04,976
All right.

00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:06,144
Thank you, Florian.
You're welcome.

00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:07,712
Before I go on, how many
calories are in this?

00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,281
Well, in our typical
old-school roll,

00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:12,217
it's about 485, 500, depending
on the size of the roll.

00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:13,451
In this?

00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:14,786
Yeah.
Yes.

00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:16,988
It's about half the calories
of our competitor.

00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:19,291
All right, sharks,
we're here

00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:22,027
because we need your investment
to open another location

00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:23,528
and start
our cinnamon-roll empire.

00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:26,164
So who's ready to make
a sweet deal with us?

00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:29,267
Did you say
another location?
Yes.

00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:30,602
Where is
your current location?

00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:32,737
Our current location is
in Berkeley, California.

00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:33,972
How many square feet?

00:34:33,972 --> 00:34:36,007
It's about
650 square feet.

00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:37,909
What are your sales
in that store?

00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,978
The sales last year
were $260,000.

00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:42,314
And before we go
into any more numbers,

00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:44,182
there's a little, sweet secret
to our cinnamon rolls

00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:45,450
that we haven't
disclosed yet.

00:34:46,785 --> 00:34:49,220
There is a secret
to a cinnamon roll?

00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:53,291
They're 100% dairy-free,
egg-free, cholesterol-free...

00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:55,360
Unbelievable.
They taste the opposite.

00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,728
Really?
...Allergy friendly,
and 100% vegan.

00:34:56,728 --> 00:34:59,531
Yes.
No!
JOHN: Whoa.

00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:01,232
There is
50 million Americans

00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:02,968
that have
a dairy intolerance.

00:35:02,968 --> 00:35:05,904
There is
another 5 million people

00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:07,939
who have
severe food allergies,

00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,775
and the top two are dairy
and eggs in children.

00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,244
So we have tons of moms
coming in, and they ask,

00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:15,046
"oh, my kid cannot have
any dairy or eggs.

00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:16,414
Do we have anything
For them?"

00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:17,916
we say, "yep.
Knock yourself out."

00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:21,786
and out of the $260,000,
what did you net last year?

00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,589
17%, so $45,000.

00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:27,125
And you sell them
for like $4 apiece?

00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,127
The average r-roll
is $5.50.

00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,930
Is there another path
to big sales

00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:34,232
besides more retail stores?

00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:37,902
We went away from thinking
about wanting to go into retail,

00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:40,271
like maybe having it
in Whole Foods or whatever,

00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:42,507
because we think our product
is only that amazing

00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:44,876
if you have the same experience
in the store.

00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:48,847
Tell me what the $200,000
is gonna get me.

00:35:48,847 --> 00:35:52,083
The $200,000 will get you
another store in San Francisco,

00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,119
and then from there, we're
gonna go into franchising.

00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:55,186
But you don't have
enough money

00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:56,454
to go into franchising
at that point,

00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:59,691
because you have to get
All the -- The legal documents.

00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:01,559
You have to get
all the state approvals.

00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,495
Costs another quarter
of a million.
Yeah. It's gonna cost
a lot of money to do that.

00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:06,064
CORCORAN: Let me get back
to the food for a minute.

00:36:06,064 --> 00:36:07,832
This was so delicious,
and it just dawned on me --

00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:08,967
When did you make this?

00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:10,035
Three days.
Three days ago.

00:36:10,035 --> 00:36:11,369
It's three days old?
Yes.
Yes.

00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:13,271
You're feeding us this stuff
that tastes so good --

00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:14,572
It's three days old?
Exactly.

00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:16,474
Do you guys do anything online,
sell online at all?

00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:18,777
We have a tiny, little,
small, online store,

00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:20,078
just because we
have demand.

00:36:20,078 --> 00:36:21,813
Hollywood celebrities
heard about us,

00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:23,748
and they wanted
to order stuff,

00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:25,583
so in order to fulfill that,
we just put it

00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,452
like a small, little e-commerce
store online.

00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:28,753
You're doing quite well.

00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:31,222
The only thing,
getting back to your numbers,

00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:34,225
is you've put a million-dollar
valuation on a single store.

00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:36,161
It's a lot of buns.

00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:39,431
And -- And so you're making
$45,000 for the investor.

00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:43,468
That means you're asking
22 times your pretax profit

00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:46,104
on a cinnamon-bun store.

00:36:46,104 --> 00:36:47,172
The $1 million valuation

00:36:47,172 --> 00:36:48,807
is on the brand
and on the concept.

00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:52,010
We do believe that could be
a national food chain.

00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,079
I don't think your business
model is that great

00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,614
because of my experience
with cousins Maine lobster,

00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:58,550
because on one food truck,

00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,618
they're selling $800,000
a year.

00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:03,555
What?
That's -- That's working.

00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,990
CORCORAN: So, because I've been
spoiled rotten

00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:10,228
by their first truck and now
their second truck, I'm out.

00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:14,499
The challenge here is I want
to be in this space,

00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:16,501
and I think I got
a little jealous

00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:19,304
because of Barbara over here
with cousins lobster.

00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:20,872
She's doing amazing.

00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:22,440
The numbers
aren't there for me,

00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,042
so I don't think
I can help you.

00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:25,043
I'm out.

00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:26,511
Okay.
Okay.

00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:28,947
This is so much like
wicked good cupcakes in Boston.

00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:30,115
It's the same thing.

00:37:30,115 --> 00:37:31,616
Here comes
a royalty deal.

00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:32,884
Here comes
a bloodsucking offer.

00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:33,918
Silence, please.

00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:37,088
A cupcake operator
in a retail location

00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:41,326
decided to change the model
and go to shipping the product.

00:37:41,326 --> 00:37:44,662
All of a sudden, they leveraged
themselves up 10,000%.

00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:48,700
Their sales went from $15,000
a week to $300,000.

00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,469
If people knew they could get
this overnighted to them

00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:52,704
in a package of six,

00:37:52,704 --> 00:37:55,707
it -- it -- you would get
a whole online business

00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:57,842
that's extremely profitable
going,

00:37:57,842 --> 00:38:00,245
and that may be more
lucrative than opening
up more retail space.

00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,616
HERJAVEC:
Two problems for me.

00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:07,685
One is the --
You're asking for $200,000.

00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:09,587
You're gonna invest it all
into a second store,

00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:10,755
and then it's gone.

00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:13,792
If it works, we then have
to raise more money,

00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:16,861
which is not a problem,
but then we try the franchise.

00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:18,096
That's one challenge.

00:38:18,096 --> 00:38:20,131
My other challenge is

00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:23,067
you're valuing the business
at $1 million today.

00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:27,338
I-I don't see the value today.
But I want to be involved.

00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:30,108
So here's my idea.
All right.

00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:34,946
I'll give you
the $200,000 for 40%,

00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:37,148
but I don't want to do
another store.

00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,951
I really like the idea

00:38:39,951 --> 00:38:42,620
of putting them
in a nice, little package

00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,422
and shipping them out.

00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:46,424
I think he should pay me a
royalty for that idea right now.

00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:47,559
[ laughter ]

00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:49,794
I think people
are gonna go online.

00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:52,530
We put all the investment
into that presence,

00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,566
and now that's
a game changer.

00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:58,303
All right. Is anything
you wanted to add?

00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:03,208
I'm really contemplating
screwing up Robert's offer.

00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,888
NARRATOR:
Two sharks are out.

00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:18,857
Shannon and Florian have
an offer from Robert --

00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:22,026
$200,000 for a 40% stake --

00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,596
But Kevin is also interested.

00:39:24,596 --> 00:39:27,866
I'm really contemplating
screwing up Robert's offer.

00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,302
What I like
about my royalty program

00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:33,738
is I don't take
any of your family's equity.

00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:35,506
I don't steal 40%
like Robert's proposal.

00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:37,642
He just takes
your family's legacy.

00:39:37,642 --> 00:39:40,678
All right,
here's an offer for you.

00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:42,981
Um, no equity whatsoever.

00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:45,650
No, no, but wait.

00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:46,918
Cover your neck.
$200-- $200,000.

00:39:46,918 --> 00:39:49,287
Was that good? Huh?
Was it?

00:39:49,287 --> 00:39:51,589
I also, uh, do not want to see
a second retail location.

00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:52,957
You have to go
and actually --

00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:54,926
My idea --

00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:56,094
Uh, actually, I think
I brought that

00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:57,629
to the table originally.
No, I think it was mine.

00:39:57,629 --> 00:40:01,266
So, and my royalty
would be $1.20 a unit.

00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:04,736
After I recoup my 200k,
it drops down to 60 cents.

00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:06,604
In perpetuity
means forever.

00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:09,774
But I've already proven
this model in wicked cupcakes.

00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:11,442
It's wildly successful.

00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:12,777
What are you gonna do,
Mark?

00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:14,879
I'm gonna listen.

00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:16,681
Do we have a chance to talk
about the switching...
HERJAVEC: Sure.

00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:17,615
...The business model
real quick?

00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:18,549
We'll be back
in one second.

00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:19,250
Okay.
Yes.
All right.

00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,868
Mark, I know exactly
what you're gonna do,

00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:38,369
you little snake over there
on the corner.

00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:40,104
What am I gonna do?

00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,639
You're gonna come in,
listen to what they say,

00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,308
and then give them a nickel more
and close the deal

00:40:43,308 --> 00:40:44,776
and tell them they have
the 10-second clock.

00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,077
Come on!
That's not
what I'm gonna do.

00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:47,478
Oh, yeah?
You're gonna say
$250,000, 40%.

00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:49,080
I will not give them
a full 10 seconds.

00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,581
[ laughter ]

00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:58,489
We really like your idea
of going into online shipping.

00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:01,859
We know our product
ships well.

00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:03,227
We don't really like...

00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:04,896
You?
...Your business model.

00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:06,397
O'LEARY: Think about it.

00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:09,534
You'd rather sell 40%
of your equity instead forever.

00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:11,502
Yeah, I -- Yes.
That's in perpetuity,
by the way.

00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:14,005
Florian, I smell
a counteroffer coming.

00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:16,641
I would love to be able
to negotiate with you
a little bit

00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:18,676
if there is
a little wiggle room.

00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:20,511
Um, maybe we can meet
at 35%.

00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:22,680
Florian,
here's where I'm at.

00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,015
I'm gonna say this at the risk

00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:25,783
of Mark Cuban standing up
and saying,

00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:26,884
"I'll take that deal."

00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:29,821
[ laughter ]
You know it, too.

00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:32,023
I'm -- I'm gonna stay at
the 40%, and I'll tell you why.

00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:34,659
If it's worth 40%,
it's worth 35%.

00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,160
It-it's a relative
small amount.

00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,695
I mean, either we're
gonna be successful

00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:40,365
in a big way together,

00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:42,166
and I don't think the 5%
will make a difference.

00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,602
Do you have anything
to add to it? nothing?

00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:48,039
All right,
I-I think --

00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:49,507
CORCORAN: Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. don't do that.

00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,242
Don't lose --
D-don't lose the deal.
What are you gonna say?

00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:53,144
Don't you dare
accept a deal when there's
something else on the table.

00:41:53,144 --> 00:41:54,645
No. There -- There's
nothing on the table.

00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:55,913
O'LEARY: There's nothing
on the table.
Yeah, bird in the hand.

00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:57,081
There's nothing
on the table.

00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:58,583
So, yeah, we would love
to work with you.

00:41:58,583 --> 00:41:59,751
JOHN: All right.
Done.

00:41:59,751 --> 00:42:01,552
CUBAN:
Way to go, Robert.
All right.

00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:03,254
CORCORAN:
Ay, yi, yi.
Thank you.

00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:04,322
Yeah.

00:42:04,322 --> 00:42:05,723
You were
just about to lose it.

00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:07,191
Awesome. Thanks, guys.
All right, awesome.

00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,426
Thank you.
All right.

00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:09,527
Congratulations.

00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,561
You guys have a great night.
Thank you.

00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:11,829
You're dead to me!

00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:12,997
[ laughter ]

00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:14,232
The exciting thing

00:42:14,232 --> 00:42:16,367
about having Robert
as a partner

00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,736
is having somebody
who is a serial entrepreneur

00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:20,538
who knows
how to scale a business.

00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:23,341
We started this business out
of passion for the business.

00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:26,611
Now we have a partner who knows
how to blow things up.
