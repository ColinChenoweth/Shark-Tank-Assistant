00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:03,770
NARRATOR:
This is the Shark Tank,
where hopeful entrepreneurs

00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,507
get a once-in-a-lifetime chance
to pitch the sharks

00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:08,242
in hopes
of getting an investment

00:00:08,242 --> 00:00:11,912
to start, grow,
or save their businesses.

00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:14,047
We've done $5.8 million
worth of sales.

00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:15,282
Ba-bam!

00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:16,917
NARRATOR: The entrepreneurs
must convince a shark

00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:19,720
to invest the full amount
they're asking for,

00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,688
or they'll walk away
with nothing.

00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:22,589
Bam --
What's the answer?

00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:24,224
I will do
anything it takes.

00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:25,259
That's not
the right answer.

00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:27,060
You are going to die
a horrible death.

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,229
NARRATOR: If the sharks
hear a great idea...

00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:30,931
I love the product.
It's genius.

00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:32,199
Whoo!
Whoo!

00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,668
...They're ready to invest
using their own money.

00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:37,104
I'll do the dance,
but at 25%.

00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:38,405
Whoa.

00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:39,907
NARRATOR: And they're
willing to fight each other

00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:41,041
for a piece of the action.

00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,577
It's a teensy, weensy,
cockroach-baseball league.

00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:45,445
It's a
$6-billion-a-year industry.

00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:46,647
That's poo-poo.

00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:48,382
You are not
an entrepreneur.

00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:49,750
It's easy
for them all to say

00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,451
when they've never
created a product.

00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:52,419
You suck.

00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:53,987
What time is selling time?

00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:55,222
It's always selling time.

00:00:57,758 --> 00:00:59,159
NARRATOR:
Who are the sharks?

00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:03,564
They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors

00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,899
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.

00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,535
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist

00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:09,937
who turned a $10,000 loan

00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:14,107
into a software business
worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:19,746
Barbara Corcoran went from
waiting tables in Manhattan

00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:24,151
to building the city's
preeminent real-estate empire.

00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:27,354
Robert Herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,

00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:29,523
is now a technology mogul

00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:34,861
who sold his first internet
companies for over $350 million.

00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:37,264
Lori Greiner, the queen of QVC,

00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:41,268
holds over 100 patents and
has launched over 300 products,

00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:45,072
grossing over a half a billion
dollars in retail sales.

00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:46,239
And Mark Cuban,

00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,042
notorious billionaire
entrepreneur, tech guru,

00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:52,045
and the outspoken owner
of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.

00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,124
First into the tank

00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,794
is a couple with a follow-up
to a very successful product.

00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:20,007
Hi, sharks.
My name is Matt Griffin.

00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:22,042
And I'm his wife,
pastry chef Emily Griffin,

00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:23,276
and we're from
Carmel, Indiana.

00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:24,544
We own baker's edge,

00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:27,414
and we are seeking $400,000
for 20% of our company.

00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:30,684
We have completely
reinvented bakeware.

00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:31,885
Everyone loves brownies,

00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,887
but have you ever
stopped to think about

00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:35,622
which brownie
is really the best?

00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,224
In a normal pan
of brownies,

00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:39,893
you have a middle and a ring
of outside-edge pieces.

00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,528
And if you're like
a lot of people,

00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,664
you always go for
those corners and edges first.

00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,733
Realizing the edges are
where the baking magic happens,

00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:47,934
we put on
our thinking caps

00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,137
and came up with a whole new way
to make brownies.

00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:53,940
In our pan, every brownie
has at least two chewy edges.

00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,642
The pan's bottom rises up

00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:59,212
and allows heat to evenly
circulate around every brownie,

00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:02,883
caramelizing and edgifying
every single brownie in the pan.

00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:04,251
For the past several years,

00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:07,387
we have dominated the larger,
multinational brands.

00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,289
We now want
to leverage that success,

00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:12,292
and we want to launch
a line of conventional bakeware.

00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,594
We think normal bakeware
can be made so much better

00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:16,863
in both form and function.

00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,265
And based upon
our current success,

00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:19,933
we're just the company
that can get it done.

00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,536
CORCORAN: Do you have a patent
on the design?

00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:23,670
We do.

00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,072
We have a utility patent
on the edge-pan design.

00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:27,374
Everybody in the industry
said, "This is dumb.

00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,109
It'll never work.
It's too new."

00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:30,777
But we stuck with it,

00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,212
and as soon as
we started making money,

00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,413
people
followed the money trail.

00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,082
Matt,
how successful are you?

00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:36,917
Since we began selling
in 2006,

00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:39,052
we've done $5.8 million
worth of sales.

00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,620
You got to be kidding.
Really?
O'LEARY:
How -- How much this year?

00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,688
HERJAVEC: Wow.
How much this year?

00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:46,426
In 2012, we did
about $256,000 of sales.

00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,729
So, what happened?
CUBAN: Something slowed down.

00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,098
Where'd it go way up, and then
when did it go way down?

00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:53,567
At the peak, we did
$1.7 million worth in a year.

00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,068
O'LEARY: Whoa.
Wow.

00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,137
$1.7 million
versus $256,000?

00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:59,639
But $1 million of that
was in 30 days.

00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,007
How?

00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,008
Oprah.
Oprah.

00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:03,176
Favorite things list.

00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,511
Wow.
O'LEARY:
So, she blessed you

00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:06,079
and she cursed you
at the same time...
Right.

00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,314
...'Cause your comparables will
never, ever be the same again.

00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:09,182
Right.
That's correct.

00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,551
And now you're paying for it.
You took that money
and put it in the bank, right?

00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:12,552
Oh, yeah.

00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:13,587
I mean,
the money was great,

00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:14,721
and we paid off
all of our debts.

00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:17,257
I know
you've been on QVC, right?

00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,358
Or you never were?
No.

00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,559
Was that a competitor?

00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:22,329
That was
an infringement,

00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:24,231
and it's no longer sold
on QVC.

00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:27,501
Okay, so, your infringers,
you've taken care of.

00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:29,302
There is no infringing product
on the market.

00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:31,471
We've swatted
all of those down.

00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:32,973
Matt, you're not here
because of the pan.

00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:36,009
By your own admission,
that's a flatline sale.

00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,012
So, how are you gonna get back
To $1.5 million in sales?

00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:39,980
Here's how
we're gonna do it.

00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,048
We call this
our better muffin pan.

00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,517
We applied kind of
our design sense

00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:45,051
and our high quality
to a muffin pan,

00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,253
and this is
what comes out.

00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:47,687
Circles don't nest
like soldiers.

00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,322
In nature, they nest
like a honeycomb.

00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:50,757
So we nested them
like a honeycomb.

00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:51,825
You know what that does?

00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,460
No.
It saves us some metal.

00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,228
There's not these extra, little
table tops between the cups,

00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,429
because they're
nested closer.

00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,064
What it also does,

00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,966
when you're filling
this thing up --

00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:00,967
There's no place really
to spill.

00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,102
It goes
in the muffin cups.

00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:03,436
Matt, is it cheaper
than a normal muffin pan?

00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:04,771
This is not cheaper.

00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:07,040
This is a $35.95 product,
just like our brownie pan.

00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,342
Is it easier to clean
than a normal muffin pan?

00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,878
It's super-easy to clean.
That's another key.

00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:14,281
It's one piece, no rivets
and welds, rounded corners.

00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:15,849
So, going forward, though,

00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:18,251
your baseline business
is $256,000 a year.

00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:19,953
Right.
That's poo-poo.

00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,423
Relative, yeah.

00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,758
Okay, so why is it worth
2 million bucks?

00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:25,859
It's worth $2 million

00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:28,161
because we have a patent
that protects us.

00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,396
We also have
a foot in the door

00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:31,932
in an industry that has
no new entrants for years.

00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,466
This is a teensy, weensy,

00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:35,669
cockroach-baseball-league
industry.

00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,771
It's a $6-billion-a-year
industry...
EMILY: It's a $6 bill--

00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:39,639
...for bakeware.
GREINER:
You guys, this pan --

00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,175
They created a pan
that truly was revolutionary.

00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,977
HERJAVEC:
No, no, but, Lori...
Seven years ago.

00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:46,713
Every single person that had
a store that sold bakeware...

00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:49,149
Seven years ago.
...Carried your pan.

00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:51,184
Guys, look.

00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,786
You did something great
seven years ago.

00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:56,590
It had to be obvious to you,
when the whole thing sank,

00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,225
you had to be going,
"I got to do something.

00:05:58,225 --> 00:05:59,526
I got to do something."

00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,228
And then,
three years later,

00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:03,563
you come up with
the muffin-top super pan?

00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:04,865
Yeah, well --

00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,299
What the hell
were you doing?

00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,268
I'm out.

00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,839
What time is selling time,
Mark?

00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,274
It's always selling time.

00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:18,111
For two years,
you've been flatlining.

00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,047
I'm not taking anything away
from what you created,

00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,450
but I like
to get into business with people

00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,552
that have a sense
of paranoia.

00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,722
In my world,
only the paranoid survive.

00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,091
You are very comfortable.

00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:32,092
I'm out.

00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:34,361
I would disagree
with that

00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:36,062
in terms of being paranoid
or being comfortable.

00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,064
You've got to understand,

00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,166
you know, we have a family
and three kids.

00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,803
At the time, we had two kids.
One was a newborn.

00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,639
We had 5,000 pans
in our basement.

00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,540
My parents came over.
My sister came over.

00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,409
We packed pans
UNTIL 4:00 in the morning.

00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,177
I had a baby getting up
every two hours,

00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:53,446
and we're packing pans
and running orders on laptops.

00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:56,082
We've been doing this hard-core
for years.

00:06:57,651 --> 00:07:00,387
O'LEARY: We've -- We've heard
the story of the past.

00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:02,188
For me,
that's completely irrelevant.

00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,590
I don't care about the past.

00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,494
If I'm gonna put up dollars
and invest in baker's edge,

00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:08,895
I want to know
what the future holds.

00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:10,563
That does not feel, to me,

00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:13,667
like it's going to change
the world for muffins.

00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:17,304
I want to know how
I'm gonna make a lot
of money selling this.

00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:18,371
Apparently, it's burned out.

00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:19,940
Everybody's got one
that wants one.

00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,742
That's the story of your deal.
You don't have a new idea.

00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,444
Uh --
I'm sorry.

00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,745
I am out.

00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,482
GREINER: You know,
it's easy for them all to say

00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:30,951
when they've never
created a product.

00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,152
[ chuckles ]
Okay?

00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:35,121
It's extremely hard
to come up with something

00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,524
as revolutionary
as what you did...

00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:38,792
It's all in the past.
...For the retails.

00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:39,960
It's all in the past.
Listen, listen.

00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,228
It doesn't matter.
What they did was great.

00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:44,531
You know, Margaret Mitchell
wrote one novel,

00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:46,299
but it was
"Gone With the Wind."

00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,668
Does she need
to write more?

00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:52,339
Does she still
get royalties on it?
You did something fantastic
here in creating that,

00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:53,606
and I admire you both

00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:56,710
because I think
that that was genius.

00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,078
So, the problem is

00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:00,880
that you do have to keep trying
to come out with more

00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,816
if you're trying
to sustain a business.

00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,551
I don't feel
that this is the wave.

00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:06,820
What you're holding in your hand
doesn't strike me

00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,356
to have that same uniqueness
as what the brownie pan did.

00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:11,458
Right.

00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,526
So, for that reason,
I'm going out.

00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,232
CORCORAN: I want to give you
a little bit of advice.

00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,167
Don't put a lot of time
into this product.

00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:26,039
You can't afford to take
the wrong product out right now.

00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,441
This is the sophomore year
in your business,

00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,977
when you've got to really
get good at what you're doing

00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,078
and be really careful.

00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,014
And I don't think
that's careful enough.

00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,049
So, I don't have
the confidence.

00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:39,185
I sure as heck wouldn't feel
comfortable with my money in it.

00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,688
So I am out.
Re-reluctantly, I'm out.

00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:44,991
Okay.
Okay.

00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,059
Thanks, you guys.
Appreciate it.
Good luck, guys.

00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,193
Good luck, guys.
We appreciate the advice.

00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,728
Thank you.

00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:51,831
They really got fixed on

00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:54,100
sort of a sales plateau
that we're experiencing,

00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,603
and -- and they took that
as bad weather on the horizon.

00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:58,338
They're savvy,
I respect their opinions,

00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:00,306
but I feel like we've
still got a long way to
go with our products.

00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,418
NARRATOR: Next into the tank
are mothers with a mission

00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:14,487
of taking the pain
out of shoe shopping with kids.

00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,295
Hi.
I'm Dr. Sylvie Shapiro.

00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,197
And I'm Nicole Brooks.

00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:28,301
Sharks, we are asking you
for $75,000

00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:31,104
for a 15% stake
in Foot Fairy.

00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:33,106
We're both moms,

00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:36,042
and when I have to take my
four children to the shoe store,

00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:39,345
it looks
something like this.

00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:40,780
WOMAN:
No, that is going down!

00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,149

[ girl shouts ]

00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,658
Running the three bases.

00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:53,026
[ girls screaming ]

00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:54,928
With Foot Fairy,

00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,796
you'll never have
to go through this.

00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,665
Foot fairy
is an iPad app

00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:02,235
that allows you to accurately
measure your child's foot size

00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:05,939
in the comfort and convenience
of your own home.

00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:06,973
I'm a podiatrist,

00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,775
and parents
constantly tell me

00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,077
they just guess
their child's shoe size,

00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,113
and I see
so many foot problems

00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:16,649
associated with kids
wearing the wrong size shoe.

00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,351
This is my daughter
sienna,

00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,253
and she'll be demoing
the app for us today.

00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:23,590
You simply take the iPad,

00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:27,026
place your child's foot
against it,

00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,962
wait for the chime...
[ chime ]

00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,096
and presto!

00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,665
Your child's shoe size
is displayed.

00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:35,401
You then have the option
of going to get shoes,

00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,704
in which you'll be
linked to zappos

00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:41,040
to a prepopulated page
of shoes in your child's size.

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,575
So, we at Foot Fairy

00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,578
hope that you shark fairies
will help us

00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:50,116
to make every mom's life
just a little bit easier.

00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:54,888
And make sure that every child
is in a proper-fitted shoe.

00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:56,823
Thank you, sienna.
You can go back to daddy now.

00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,791
GREINER:
Thanks, sienna.
CORCORAN: Thank you.

00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,260
Your app is totally done now,

00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,829
but you'd use the money
to further enhance the app?

00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,264
What's missing?

00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:07,300
Oh, well, we want to build out
the back-end infrastructure,

00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,103
so we'd love to be able to
store our customer e-mails.

00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:13,072
It just really gives us a way
to encourage people

00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:15,008
to buy shoes,
to remind them, because --

00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,576
But you're not
selling them shoes, right?

00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:18,144
Why is there an upside
for that?
We are.

00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,479
Oh, actually,
that's our sales model.

00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:22,115
Our app is free.

00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:24,384
We have an affiliate sales model
with zappos

00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:27,420
where we get
between 8% to 18%.

00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,322
How many downloads of the app
do you have today?

00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:31,324
13,144.

00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:33,893
But we just launched
three weeks ago officially.

00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,562
HERJAVEC: In the three weeks
you've been doing it,

00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:37,997
have you actually gotten
a commission check from zappos?

00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,165
No.

00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,370
We have
a 98% click-through rate,

00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,606
but we cannot
track our commission

00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:48,274
because
there was a glitch.

00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,043
It was going to the zappos app
rather than --

00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,978
Have you fixed that glitch?
That's a very important glitch.

00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:54,180
We fixed that
about three days ago.
GREINER:
That's a big click-through rate.

00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,416
It was a very big one.
It's a very big click-through.
We are very excited.

00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,884
GREINER: It's a very big
click-through rate.

00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,419
But where are you
on the home page?

00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:01,387
Like, I'm curious,
as you launch --

00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,090
We went directly
from our app to a pre--
No, no, no.
But wait, wait, wait.

00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,626
I have a question. It's,
like, getting crazy in here.
Sorry, sorry. Sorry!

00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:08,328
HERJAVEC: Wow.
Here's my question.

00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:10,830
Is zappos doing anything
to advertise you

00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,232
so that people
are going to your app?

00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,901
No. We don't need zappos
to advertise.

00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,135
We are confident.

00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:18,104
We spent $2,600

00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:21,374
and got over 13,000 downloads
in less than 3 weeks.

00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:22,775
Also, I mean,
another way to make money

00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,010
besides
just the click-through

00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,745
is we'd love to have advertising
and sponsorships.

00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,014
But tell me -- Why don't they
put you on their main site?
Um...

00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:29,916
We have such a
targeted market of moms.
If it -- If it helps --

00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,018
GREINER: They should.
It's an accessory.

00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:34,320
Well, maybe that's something
you could help us with.
It's like a help
to their customers.

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,788
We would love
to be on zappos' main site.

00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:36,789
We would love to be.
Yeah.

00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:37,991
Did you suggest it
in a meeting?

00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:39,726
It's a podiatrist,
therapist mom.
[ chuckles ]

00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,427
Did you suggest it?
We're here
to answer your questions.

00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,996
HERJAVEC: Wow, Nicole, you're
like that dog in that movie.
When we --

00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:45,498

doing one thing, and he
Sees -- "Squirrel!"

00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:50,336
I'm really committed
to this.
She is. She's --

00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,805
And I'm committed --
I'm committed to showing you all

00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,140
how fabulous this idea is.

00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,142
And we know that
we can make you see --

00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:58,611
CUBAN: But, n-Nicole --
O'LEARY:
Why aren't you telling me
about something proprietary

00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,714
or a patent or a technology
or software no one can emulate?

00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,082
We're the propri--
We are the -- I'm a podiatrist.

00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:03,916
You're -- You're it?

00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:06,986
L-ladies, if it works --

00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:09,289
If it works
and you get 10,000 orders...

00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,191
We're n-- We're gonna get
500,000 downloads at least.
Okay. You're -- You're dead
before that happens.

00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:13,459
And each --
You had a great idea.

00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,261
There's nothing proprietary
About it -- Bang! --

00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,963
The guys that care
are gonna emulate this.

00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,564
No, actually,
they can't.

00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:21,434
Because what you have here
is expertise and passion.

00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:22,802
I'm out.

00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,139
GREINER:
You know what?

00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,907
I've never seen somebody

00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:31,544
so exuberant about what
they're doing as the two of you.

00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:37,083
For me, it's not a business yet.
You're just at the very start.

00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,251
I'm out.

00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,724
HERJAVEC:
Nicole, I love the excitement.

00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:47,994
When you first came out,
I thought it was a great idea.

00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,629
And my first thought was,

00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:53,032
"Wow, I can't believe this isn't
On the zappos website today."

00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:54,467
So, the question is

00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:56,602
is it such a difficult
technology to create

00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,938
that nobody else could do it?

00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:00,406
CUBAN:
Who wrote the software?

00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:03,242
We have a tech-- Technology team
that worked with both of us.

00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:06,012
To create --
And where'd you get
your technology team?

00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,147
Where did we
get them from?
Yeah.

00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,983
We researched it,
and we found them.
We -- Yeah.

00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:13,820
But, Sylvie, do you realize,
by virtue of that answer,

00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,723
if you were able to, as
non-programming-computer people,

00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:19,892
find somebody who could write
it, I-it could be duplicated.

00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,195
You know what?
Anything can be duplicated.

00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:25,398
But -- But I guess, there's
nothing proprietary with it.

00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:27,867
No, Robert.
Please don't say that.

00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,670
[ laughter ]

00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,971
I'm out.

00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:37,276
So, that -- That leaves
Barbara and Mark.

00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,280
CORCORAN: I think, uh,

00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,618
you're a perfect example
of, "Enthusiasm is not enough."

00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:49,122
You're wildly enthusiastic,
but that's where it ends.

00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:50,123
It's a wild card.

00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:51,457
I don't know
if it's gonna work,

00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:52,959
whether you can
make money on it.

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,495
Um, so I couldn't
possibly invest.

00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:57,363
I'm out.

00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:04,270
And now -- Now we've left
with mister....Mr. Mark.

00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:11,144
Um, if some world-renowned
podiatrist walked in the door

00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:13,379
and you had
to defend the product

00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:14,847
and why it's better than

00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:18,084
something this world-renowned
podiatrist could create,

00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,652
what would you say?

00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,721
Because this is
what I'm passionate about.

00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:23,289
CUBAN:
No, forget passion.
T-this --

00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:24,824
That's not the right answer.

00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:27,794
I'm trying to figure out
what differentiates you.

00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:30,596
Okay.
And if I hear the word
"passion" again, I'm out.

00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,931
'Cause I already know
you're passionate.

00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,733
The longer the backstory,
the worse the business.

00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:36,636
So, world-famous podiatrist
walks in the door

00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:39,205
and says,
"Okay, Dr. Foot Mom,

00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:41,340
why is yours better
than something I can create?"

00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,341
Right.

00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:43,443
So -- bam --
what's the answer?

00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,020
NARRATOR:
Four sharks are out.

00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:57,557
Sylvie and Nicole
have one more chance for a deal.

00:15:57,557 --> 00:16:00,426
So, world-famous podiatrist
walks in the door

00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:03,696
and says,
"Okay, Dr. Foot Mom,

00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:06,866
"why is yours better
than something I can create?

00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:08,334
What is it
that you brought?"
Right.

00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:09,535
So -- bam --
what's the answer?

00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:10,803
Accuracy.

00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,538
Why is your accuracy going
to be better than somebody --

00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,173
Because we spent
over a year

00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,842
determining
how to make this

00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,844
the most accurate
shoe-sizing app.

00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:19,078
So,
if I did a search for

00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:22,748
"app that determines
child's foot size,"

00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:25,318
trying to get
a feel for the competition,

00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,619
what would I see?

00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:28,721
You would see ours.
Foot fairy.
What else?

00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,157
You would see
a couple other apps.

00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:37,330
And what I-- And what about
theirs is different than yours?

00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,564
The mom has
to put the child's foot

00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:39,765
and then slide their finger
on it.

00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:40,967
BROOKS: A lot of room
for parental error.

00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,268
It's not as accurate.

00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:43,903
We really wanted ours
to be convenient and accurate.

00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:45,137
That's why we
went to shopping malls

00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,306
and had kids test it.
Got it. Got it.

00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:49,041
Here --
Here's why I'm interested.

00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,943
I have a company called
fashion metric,

00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:55,081
and they did a whole exhaustive
analysis just on men's shirts.

00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:56,315
So,
if you're this body type,

00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,150
this is the shirt
that fits you in this manner

00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,052
versus that manner.

00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:02,955
Sensors and metrics, I think,
are gonna be huge in the future.

00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,023
So I like this.
Mm-hmm.

00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,024
My fear?

00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,827
You guys
will drive me batty.

00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:10,830
They'll put me
in the loony bin, right?

00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,499
We would love to work with you.
I mean, we really would.

00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,001
And we -- We won't
drive you batty.

00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:16,302
We -- We'll work together,

00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:17,503
we will, you know -- we'll
seek any of your advice

00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,205
that you have.

00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:22,008
I mean, I really, really
want to get this to parents.

00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:24,744
We really believe, as you said,
that is the future,

00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:25,912
that we want to be a --

00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:27,547
People to sit in the comfort
of their own home

00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:28,648
and be able to have --

00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:30,583
Purchase things
that fit them properly

00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:33,119
that are for their health
and for their aesthetic.

00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:38,057
I'll offer you $100,000...

00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,528
...For 40%,

00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,630
but I'm gonna put
contingencies on it, okay?

00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,733
One -- I get to go through
and test to make sure it works.

00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,669
Absolutely.
Two--
I get to go through and check

00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:52,138
to make sure that
there's nothing comparable.

00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:54,740
Three -- I'm gonna
check all the contracts

00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,677
to make sure that we truly
do own the software,

00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:58,878
and that it's well-written.

00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:02,148
So, it's 100k, 40%.

00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:03,115
Yes or no?

00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:10,856
Yes.

00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:11,891
Yes.
Done.

00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:13,359
Thank you.
And if I need therapy,

00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,461
I get to call it off.
[ laughs ]
Yeah.

00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,430
That would be
a door relationship...
Thanks, guys.

00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,230
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
...So I couldn't --
I couldn't engage in that.

00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,966
Thanks, guys.
Thank you.

00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:21,767
GREINER: Congratulations.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:25,771
High five?

00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,173
[ both squeals ]

00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:29,141
We're so excited that we're
gonna be working with Mark.

00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:32,111
[ cheering ]

00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,913
SHAPIRO: I mean, this is,
like, really a dream come true.

00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:35,681
Mr. Cuban,
to work with him --

00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,717
I-I couldn't have asked
for a better shark.

00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:40,519
NARRATOR: This season, we've
seen amazing success stories

00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,788
from our "Shark Tank"
entrepreneurs.

00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,391
Whoa! Wow!

00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:47,159
DYER:
Business has really taken off

00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,528
since making a deal
with Kevin and Robert.

00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,764
We're coming up on half
a million dollars in revenue.

00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:54,500
YOUNG: Since partnering with
Lori, in less than eight months,

00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,303
we've done over $3 million
in sales.

00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,472
Those aren't projections.
Those are real numbers.

00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,207
TSELIKIS: We're so lucky to have
made a deal with Barbara.

00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:03,075
Just a year later,

00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:05,878
we're approaching
$3.5 million in sales.

00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:06,912
CUBAN:
What's up, Doug?

00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,547
MARSHALL:
Making a deal with Mark and Lori

00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:10,883
changed our life
beyond our wildest dreams.

00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:12,818
MAN: Going on "Shark Tank" has
taken a small, little product

00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,020
that was run out of my apartment

00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,821
and made it into
a multimillion-dollar company.

00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,891
This is a great start,
but this is just the beginning.

00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,127
I am so proud of you.
Thank you so much, Mom.

00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:23,763
One day, I hope to be
the best company in America

00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:24,997
for women to work for.

00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,666
As far as women have come
in the corporate world,

00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,401
I think there's still
a long ways to go,

00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:31,003
and I want to be the one
to make that change happen.

00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,638
CHILD:
Since "Shark Tank,"

00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,907
we've done almost $6 million
in sales nationwide.

00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,609
We like to think
that we're continuing

00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:38,277
the tradition
of American innovation.

00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,713
It's awesome to be able
to create jobs

00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:43,149
and provide a living wage
for lots of employees.

00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:45,651
CAMERON:
Manufacturing has been gone
for a long time in this state.

00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:47,053
But we're bringing it back.

00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:49,055
O'LEARY: There's never been
anything like "Shark Tank."

00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:50,923
It's the most powerful
venture-capital firm on Earth.

00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,625
It has sharks, it has money,

00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,560
and it has millions of people
watching.

00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,596
When you put all of
those together, magic happens.

00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,098
QUACKENBUSH:
Our "Shark Tank" experience

00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:00,533
has been a roller coaster
of emotion.

00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,001
To think that
we started in a street tent --

00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:04,704
And now what the future
holds for us just blows us away.

00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,606
WHITEMAN: Each morning, I've
woken up, I've pinched myself.

00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:10,076
I just can't believe
this is really happening,

00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:13,179
and I just can't wait to see
what happens in the future.

00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:16,082
KRUMINS: It brings me to tears
thinking about how proud I am

00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:18,484
to show my daughter
that you can do this,

00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:19,752
that you can follow your dreams.

00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:21,754
I'm truly touched.
Thank you.

00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:29,795
NARRATOR:
Next into the tank

00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:31,464
are entrepreneurs
with a simple solution

00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:34,100
to a tedious
and time-consuming problem.

00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:42,108
Hello, sharks.
My name is Wayne sikorcin.

00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:44,110
My name is Scott Smith.

00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,579
Our company is Tie-Not,
and we're here today

00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,682
seeking $125,000
of your hard-earned money

00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:52,151
in exchange for 10% equity
in our company.

00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:54,620
Tie-Not was invented
to cure an epidemic

00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,057
that occurs worldwide
every year

00:20:58,057 --> 00:21:01,894
from sore fingers from tying
these tiny water balloons.

00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:04,530
We're excited today, sharks,
to show you two of our items --

00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,232
The Tie-Not filler
and the Tie-Not tying stick.

00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:07,967
With these two items,

00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,135
anyone and everyone

00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:11,604
can simply fill and tie
water balloons in seconds.

00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:19,478
Ba-bam!
O'LEARY: Oh, yeah, that's --
That's pretty cool.

00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:20,980
CORCORAN:
Pretty cool.
GREINER:
Wow. Yeah.

00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,114
So, now even
"Sausage-Fingers" Smith

00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,382
can now tie
these little water balloons.

00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:24,683
Oh, gosh!

00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:26,085
[ laughter ]

00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:28,921
Just in case you missed it,
you take our Tie-Not filler --

00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:30,689
It attaches
to any garden hose --

00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,491
And you insert
the Tie-Not stick.

00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:34,760
The stick is universal 'cause
you can tie the water balloons

00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,061
by the stick
by hand, also.

00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:37,930
I want to try it.
Let me load it up
for you, Kev.

00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:38,998
I have
to load it myself.

00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:40,399
I have to learn
'cause I just bought it.

00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:41,567
You're not at the store.

00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:42,601
SIKORCIN:
Slip on a balloon.

00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:43,636
Now tilt it forward.

00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,271
[ laughter ]
I tilt it forward, right?

00:21:45,271 --> 00:21:46,405
Push your piston down.

00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:47,907
The orange piston
fills the balloon.

00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:50,042
All right.
Now what? I just --

00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:51,911
Swing it
around the stick.
CUBAN: Oh, my God.

00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:53,312
There you go.

00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:57,149
Now pull it off and put it
through the top of the slot.

00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,350
Let go.

00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,419
Pull the balloon
straight off.

00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:01,654
Did it work?

00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,088
GREINER:
It worked.
Voilà!

00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:04,957
And he even wrapped it around
several times.
CUBAN: TA-da!

00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:06,258
Very cool.
Kevin.

00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:09,361
[ gasps ]
Oh!

00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:11,564
[ laughter ]
Oh! I didn't see that coming.

00:22:11,564 --> 00:22:13,432
If that had broken,
I'd kill you.

00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:14,733
That was...

00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:16,669
SIKORCIN: Now we're ready
for your questions.

00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,671
Can we see them?
Well, yes, you can.

00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:19,839
[ laughs ]
Okay.

00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,674
So, you got one packaged
and you got one loose.

00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,510
I kept it loose so you
can appreciate the
technology behind it.

00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,911
Thank you.

00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:29,415
So, you were saying that you
don't have to own both things.

00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:31,717
You can just have
the stick...

00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:33,619
You can just have the stick.
...Or you can have
the filling device, too?

00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:35,855
Yes, correct.
CORCORAN: What do you miss
when you just have the stick?

00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,857
GREINER:
So, the stick would work
if you did it out of your sink?

00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:38,791
Yes.

00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:44,663
So, how did you
come up with the idea?

00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:47,066
What it was is, my wife
bought 250 water balloons

00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:48,834
for a family picnic
back in 2008,

00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:51,437
and I got the tedious task
of tying these things.

00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:54,106
My kids couldn't tie them.
So, I tied like 15.

00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:55,941
Kids ripped through it
in like two seconds,

00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:57,176
and I said,
"I'm done."

00:22:57,176 --> 00:22:59,445
But I wasn't done
thinking about the problem.

00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:01,647
So every day after work,
I'd come home, I'd sketch,

00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:04,383
and one day, my daughter Abby
looks at one of my sketches,

00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,252
and says,
"That looks like a stick."

00:23:06,252 --> 00:23:08,654
So she goes and grabs a stick,
brings it in to me.

00:23:08,654 --> 00:23:09,955
I carve out
a little pocket and a slot,

00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:11,257
we go outside
and tied a water balloon.

00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:14,426
Hmm.
And I was like,
"Whoa. It just tied."

00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:16,195
So then I followed
all the proper procedures.

00:23:16,195 --> 00:23:18,430
We went
for patents first.

00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,532
So, I built an eight-cavity mold
after the patents issued,

00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:22,034
and we made it
to the toy fair in 2010.

00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:23,469
And that's where
we launched our product.

00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:25,137
What did you sell of it?

00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:26,639
First year?
$112,000.
Yeah.

00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:27,907
Good for you.

00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:29,141
What does this sell for?

00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,110
It sells for $4.99,
and it comes with 50 balloons.

00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,178
And what's your cost
to make the entire package?

00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:34,747
Uh, it's about $1.50
right now.

00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:38,150
Why isn't this product
Sort of $7.99?

00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,153
Why does it have to be $4.99?
[ chuckling ]
We asked the same question.

00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:43,522
We started out at $9.99,
and we sold a boatload of them.

00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:44,823
Then what happened
to that price?

00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:46,725
Well...
We got into
a licensing agreement

00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:47,726
with a large toy company.

00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:51,864
What was your percentage
on the licensing agreement?
6%.

00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:53,465
Kevin, what do you
think about that?

00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:54,967
You know, thank goodness
you've met me.

00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:56,035
[ laughter ]

00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:57,336
'Cause you got
a low-end deal.

00:23:57,336 --> 00:23:59,104
7% to 11% is the range.

00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,941
What were your total sales last
year, including the licensing?

00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,509
$340-- With the licensing,
$385,000.

00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:05,911
But you still have
the license agreement in place?

00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:07,146
Yes, we do.
It's in place.

00:24:07,146 --> 00:24:08,480
When --
Is there minimums on it?

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,815
Yes, there are.
Yes.

00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:11,183
And they're hitting -- Obviously
hitting their minimums.

00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:13,118
Is there an escalator
in the minimums every year?

00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,787
No, there's no escalator.
Oh!

00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,689
Oh, you're
such a bad negotiator.
Ooh.

00:24:16,689 --> 00:24:18,657
And how many more years --
How much longer does it go?
Well, it renews
every year.

00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,225
Oh, oh, really?
Autorenew or you can --

00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:22,494
Yeah, we didn't want to
lock in anything long term.

00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:25,264
So can you cancel it
at your option?
Oh, yeah. We got like, what is
it, a 90-day out of jail?

00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:27,066
CORCORAN: You're kidding?
Cancel it.
We have a 60-day
get-out-of-jail agreement.

00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:28,667
Oh, that's cool.
O'LEARY:
You know, l-look.

00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:32,438
Your cash flows don't justify
your $1.25 million valuation.

00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:33,439
That's the problem.

00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,076
You're overpricing
your value right now.

00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:39,611
If you license it with all
the players, it was never --

00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:41,714
Yeah, but you're asking me
to pay

00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:44,183
for what I can
bring the business to now.

00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:46,385
It's -- It's not interesting
for me.

00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:49,388
Yeah, I could add a lot of
value, but I got to wet my beak.

00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:50,422
I understand.

00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:51,857
That's a big,
old beak, too.
Yeah.

00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:54,693
Guys, look -- Kevin's
the toy maven, I'm not.

00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:55,761
I think it's great.

00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:57,763
You guys deserve
a ton of credit.

00:24:57,763 --> 00:25:00,299
I-it really is
an ingenious product.

00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:01,400
SMITH: Whoo!
SIKORCIN: Whoo!

00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,434
Whoo!

00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,705
GREINER: [ chuckles ]
I'm out.

00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:07,940
[ laughter ]

00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,308
Thank you
for the opportunity.
Absolutely.

00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:11,510
Hey, guys, I-I love --
I love the toy business.

00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:15,481
And I like businesses that
bring a smile to your face...
Yes.

00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:18,784
...And make me happy
and make money.
Yes.

00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:22,688
But your --
Your value's a little crazy.

00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:27,426
$1.25 million?
I-it's not there today.

00:25:27,426 --> 00:25:28,761
I'm out.

00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:31,397
Thank you
for the opportunity.
We appreciate it.

00:25:31,397 --> 00:25:34,500
You know, for me,
this is a perfect QVC product.

00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,036
It really, really is.
GREINER: Actually, it --
You know what?

00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,470
It really kind of isn't

00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,340
because it's
too inexpensive, actually,

00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,108
to be a good QVC product.

00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:46,612
You have to be really more in
like a $12 or $15 price range.

00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:48,414
Just tell them
it's genius.

00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:50,049
Whoo!
Whoo!
[ laughter ]

00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,984
Oh, is that
the key word?
It's genius.

00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:53,652
SIKORCIN: Whoo!

00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:54,820
[ laughter ]
It's genius.

00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,222
Whoo!
Whoo!

00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,657
Now you're
playing with us.

00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:00,926
Believe me,
our wives hate it.

00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:04,463
To me, just the valuation,
I-it's not there for me.

00:26:04,463 --> 00:26:06,899
You're not at $1.25 million.

00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,934
And so, for that reason,
I'm out.

00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:12,905
Let me ask you this.
Where would you value us?

00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,840
What did you make
on $380,000?
What'd you make last --

00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,341
$40,000.
And how much you p--
You guys paying each other?

00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:18,243
Or, yourselves?
Well, we're
building a brand,

00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,344
so no one's taking
any money out of it.

00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:20,579
Nothing's
taken out of it.

00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,914
So, that's $40,000
before you took a penny out.

00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,382
That's correct.
Yeah.

00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:24,983
So it's $40,000?
Why so low?
Where did all the money go?

00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:26,785
Trade shows.
Trade shows.

00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:28,821
We're always marketing,
right?

00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:31,123
Guys, I've been in the toy
industry a long, long time.

00:26:31,123 --> 00:26:33,058
A business like this
will be at five-times cash flow,

00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:35,060
you're worth about $200,000.

00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,829
So you're not worth
$1.25 million.

00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:38,130
That's reality.

00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,399
Where I would have
loved to have seen this product

00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:43,035
was before you did that
license deal, 'cause
that's my specialty.

00:26:43,035 --> 00:26:45,404
I really can't help you
that much.

00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:48,774
It's not big enough for me.
I like big.

00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:50,876
How do you get big
without a strategic partner?

00:26:50,876 --> 00:26:53,378
Yeah. I'm sorry, guys.
I'm out.

00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:02,287
You know, it's a hard one,
because I love the product.

00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:07,493
Because I have probably blown up
5 million water balloons.

00:27:07,493 --> 00:27:10,162
I'm the go-to mom in the
neighborhood in the summertime.

00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:12,131
We just gave you
more margarita time.
Absolutely.

00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,365
[ laughter ]
Oh, good.

00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:15,167
Now, I'll make you an offer.

00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:19,071
I'm gonna give you the $125,000
for 25% of your business.

00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:21,240
Wow.
SIKORCIN:
That's fair.

00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,275
O'LEARY: Incredible offer.
Wait.

00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:24,543
Yeah. Very good.
But I'm gonna give it to you

00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:29,047
in the form of $50,000 cash,
$75,000 credit line.

00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:34,353
I think where we're at

00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:37,356
is we're more comfortable
with an 18% offer...

00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:43,262
...The $50,000 in cash
and $100,000 in credit line

00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:46,265
to move us into next year.

00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:48,967
Because we are
really gonna need inventory,

00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:51,837
so that's where I'm gonna need
to really tap into resources.
Wow.

00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:53,705
Well, bring it on down,
baby.

00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:57,342
[ laughter ]

00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:00,779
I'm gonna give you
a chance to reconsider.

00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:05,384
You've heard my offer.
You know the Shark Tank.

00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:08,086
You obviously know
what I could bring to the table.

00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:10,756
So I'm not going
to negotiate that.

00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:15,761
Okay, can you
Work a little bit -- 20%?

00:28:15,761 --> 00:28:17,196
We got a deal right now.

00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,698
Lock hands, we do
the dance together, 20%.

00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,233
I don't think so.

00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:23,435
I think I'll stay
with what I offered.

00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:25,537
Whoa.

00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,107
She's tough.

00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:30,409
I'm not tough.

00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:35,080
I'll do the dance,
but at 25%.

00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,748
If I do the dance,
will you do it at 20%?

00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:39,051
[ laughter ]

00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,986
Um...

00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:42,087
Honestly,
I can't come there.

00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:43,121
All right, I'm out.

00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:44,756
All right.

00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:48,026
Good luck.

00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:53,198
I can't believe
they didn't take your offer.

00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:54,866
It was a decent offer.

00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:56,668
Hey, I like when entrepreneurs
stick their ground and
believe in their value.

00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:01,573
SIKORCIN: Although Barbara's
offer was very fair,

00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,443
we just needed to see eye to eye
on the equity value,

00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:05,711
and she took too much.

00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:07,579
Tie-Not has
a huge growth potential.

00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:19,625
My name is Kaeya Majmundar.

00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:20,792
I'm from Chicago, Illinois,

00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:22,961
and I'm a sophomore
at Emory University.

00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:25,397
[ all chanting in Hindi ]

00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:27,633
I was raised in a very
traditional Indian family.

00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:30,269
Both my parents are doctors,
and it was always their dream

00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,004
for me to become a doctor
as well.

00:29:32,004 --> 00:29:33,272
Good job.
Good job.

00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,641
My childhood summers
were spent practicing violin

00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:38,110
and going to the library
and taking math classes.

00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,446
But it wasn't weird to me,
because that's what all my
Indian friends were doing.

00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,581
But then I got to college,

00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:44,283
and I saw
all these different people

00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:45,450
studying different things,

00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,485
and that excited me.

00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:48,620
When I came up with
my fabulous idea,

00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,256
I knew at that moment
that I had to pursue it.

00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:53,292
Creating my product
was actually the easy part.

00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,160
The hard part
was telling my parents

00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,828
I no longer
wanted to be a doctor.

00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:58,430
I know it's been tough
for you guys.

00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,699
I'm gonna
make you guys proud, I promise.

00:30:00,699 --> 00:30:03,502
My parents had a path for me,
but I completely changed it.

00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:05,470
There's a lot of pressure
to succeed,

00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,772
and failure's not an option.

00:30:06,772 --> 00:30:08,440
I want to channel
the hard-work ethic

00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,409
that my parents and
my grandparents taught me,

00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:12,210
and I want to make
my own American dream.

00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,512
And I need the sharks to do it.

00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,361
Hi, sharks.

00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:30,662
My name is Kaeya Majmundar,

00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,698
and I'm a sophomore
at Emory University.

00:30:32,698 --> 00:30:34,166
My product is bzbox,

00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:39,538
and I am seeking $50,000 in
exchange for 20% of my company.

00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:41,940
So, this all started after
my freshman year of college.

00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,609
My friend had asked me to move
her boxes to our storage unit

00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:45,944
while she took her chem final.

00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:47,713
I agreed, of course,
so I went over,

00:30:47,713 --> 00:30:49,748
and I saw her boxes
ready to go by the door.

00:30:49,748 --> 00:30:51,350
But as I leaned in
to pick one of them up...

00:30:52,551 --> 00:30:55,987
...Everything literally
fell straight through.

00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:58,623
That amounted to a long day

00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:01,526
of me having to repack
and move all of her stuff.

00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,929
I decided I had to find
a solution.

00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:06,565
That's when I innovated
the bzbox.

00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:08,667
Now, Robert,
you're a connoisseur for racing,

00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:10,669
so I'm gonna challenge you
to a race today.

00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:12,270
So why don't you
come on up here?

00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,906
Make sure he doesn't
crash your deal.
[ chuckles ]

00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:17,275
I thought you were gonna
knock yourself out, there.

00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:20,178
So, Robert is going to
assemble the traditional box

00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:22,681
that you would buy
from any hardware store,

00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:24,649
and I'm gonna
assemble my bzbox.

00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:27,152
So, Mark, why don't you
give us your Mark,

00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:28,720
and Robert and I
are gonna race.

00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,756
Are you --
Are you ready?
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. hang on.

00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:32,023
What am I doing?
Am I putting this --

00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:33,425
You've probably never
assembled a box, have you?

00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:35,527
[ laughter ]
Yeah, the truth comes out.

00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:39,464
I'm so rich, I hired Kevin
to put boxes together for me.
Oh, my goodness.

00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:40,799
On your Mark...

00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:43,201
...Get set...

00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,271
...Go!

00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:49,107
All right, I'm done.

00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:51,877
Oh! You were whupped.
You suck.

00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:52,811
Do it again.
I didn't see it.

00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:54,379
All right,
I can do it again.

00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:55,514
I just unassembled it,

00:31:55,514 --> 00:31:57,382
and now I'm gonna
assemble it again.

00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:58,784
Bam, done.

00:31:58,784 --> 00:31:59,985
Pretty nice.

00:31:59,985 --> 00:32:01,653
MAJMUNDAR: So, sharks,
my flat-folding design

00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,989
is ideal for anyone
who is looking for a unique,

00:32:03,989 --> 00:32:05,390
space-saving, easy-to-use,

00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,392
and, might I add,
sexy storage solution.

00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:09,494
With your expertise
and my drive,

00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:12,264
we can target
every houseware, homeware,

00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:13,999
craft store, storage store --
You name it.

00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:15,133
Man, I'm excited!

00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,401
'Cause this product,

00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:18,603
it will revolutionize
the packing industry.

00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:21,406
So, have you done any retail
selling of this product yet?

00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:23,041
I have not.
This is brand-new.

00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,876
I started it
less than a year ago.

00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:26,211
I'm a sophomore in college,

00:32:26,211 --> 00:32:28,246
and so, I-I thought about it
last year.

00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:30,615
What is the cost of your box
versus that box?

00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,985
If you were looking at,
say, 10,000 units,

00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:38,557
the cost for a traditional one
would be under $1.

00:32:38,557 --> 00:32:41,293
This one will be $1.75.

00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:44,162
Does it ever
get to the same price?

00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:47,032
It will with -- With
larger quantities, of course.

00:32:47,032 --> 00:32:50,435
You know, I have sold hundreds
of thousands of those boxes

00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:52,637
to consumers
in my storage facilities.

00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,640
That box is actually made
for about 56 cents.

00:32:56,875 --> 00:33:00,212
Yeah, I -- My -- My estimate
was for the 10,000 units.

00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:02,047
CORCORAN: Do you mind
going back for me?

00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:03,348
What is your background?

00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:05,450
Yeah, so, I was actually
raised in a family of doctors.

00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:06,451
I'm Indian.

00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:07,752
Yes, the stereotype is true.

00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:09,754
Aww.
My whole family said,
"You know what?

00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,256
"You're a woman.
You're Indian.

00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:13,492
"You cannot do anything
other than medicine

00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,327
because you're not
gonna make it."

00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:17,796
And I said,
"No, absolutely not."

00:33:17,796 --> 00:33:19,965
And when I confronted
my parents,

00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:22,934
all he-- heck broke loose.

00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:24,035
[ laughs ]

00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:26,771
It was truly
a-a huge moment in my life.

00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:27,906
CORCORAN:
So what happened?

00:33:27,906 --> 00:33:29,241
You said,
"Boxes are for me, Mom"?

00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:30,909
Yeah, and they laughed.
It was a joke.

00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:32,310
It was a joke in my family.

00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,346
They say, you know, "What do you
want to do with your life?"

00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:36,014
And I say, "I want
to be my own boss.

00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,415
"I have this excellent product,

00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:39,084
I have faith,
And I'm going to do it."

00:33:40,886 --> 00:33:43,388
Then I signed up to be in

00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:46,124
the collegiate entrepreneurs'
organization competition.

00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:49,628
That is the largest national
competition for entrepreneurs.

00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:51,162
I ended up
winning the competition.

00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:52,597
HERJAVEC:
Wow, congratulations.
Congratulations.

00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:54,332
And my parents were like,
"Wow. All right."

00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:56,468
Did you
file a patent on this?

00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:58,436
Uh, yes.
It's patent pending.

00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,906
I see you have other boxes
up there.
Yes.

00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:02,707
Can you show me
the red box?

00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:03,875
It's out of plastic?

00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,176
Plastic, yes.
Yeah.

00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:06,511
I'd like to see
how flat that folds down.

00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:08,713
One of the things --

00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,116
It sounds like you've
tried to do some pricing...
Yes.

00:34:11,116 --> 00:34:13,785
...To see how this would
price out in the market.
Yes.

00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:17,455
Adding this little velcro piece
is very expensive, right?
Yes. Mm-hmm.

00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,926
Why can't that be done
with another material?

00:34:20,926 --> 00:34:22,827
Perhaps another
strip of cardboard?

00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:25,430
GREINER:
Well, velcro's super-strong.
It's expensive.

00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:28,867
Do you think people are willing
to pay a premium for your box

00:34:28,867 --> 00:34:31,303
to knock about 60 seconds
out of their day?

00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:32,971
CUBAN:
I don't know.
Absolutely.

00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:34,372
O'LEARY: Because that's
the crux of your deal.
Yeah, I don't see it.

00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:36,241
Absolutely.

00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,677
Kaeya, what about
another application?

00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:42,514
Have you gone to any large
businesses and met with them?
Yes.

00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:45,083
I was approached
by an executive at Lowe's.

00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,419
They absolutely
loved the product.

00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:50,889
Did Lowe's say to you,
"I will buy this product"?

00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:53,124
Yes. He said,
"Let's get them into Lowe's."

00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:55,160
Did he tell you
how many he would buy?

00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,162
How many stores
he would put it into?

00:34:57,162 --> 00:34:59,898
No, because at that point
in time I wasn't manufacturing.

00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:02,601
But he said, "Come back to me.
Let's get it into Lowe's."

00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:07,238
I had a meeting in Illinois
at shore's supply stores,

00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:10,442
went to the C.E.O.,
and he loved it, as well.

00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,677
And so, he said
that he will put me in touch

00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:13,812
with all of his contacts.

00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:15,780
CUBAN: Hopefully,
at some point, you said,

00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,948
"How many
are you gonna buy?"

00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:17,882
Yeah.

00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:19,117
What was his response?

00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,952
He said he was
interested in buying the box,

00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,121
but he said I would have
to bring it down to be under $1.

00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:27,225
Now, what that tells you
is they don't value the utility

00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:30,595
more than
their current product.

00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:33,798
If they did, they would say,
"I'll pay a penny more."

00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:39,304
When I went to go, I wasn't
far enough in the process.

00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:42,507
I need to get multiple orders

00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:44,242
to match the prices
that they're interested in.

00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:45,744
O'LEARY:
So, here's the question.

00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:49,080
Can you make it and do you know
at what volumes you'd need

00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,448
to match the pricing?

00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:53,752
What would it take to
get the price down to 56 cents?

00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,489
It would be
about 400,000 units.

00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:04,663
Kaeya, look, I think you've
done a great presentation.

00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:06,798
At your age,
I couldn't have stood up here

00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:08,667
and presented to
the five of us,

00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:13,104
but I don't see the problem
that this solution is fixing.

00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:16,141
I'm out.

00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:17,709
Thank you, Robert.

00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:19,611
Think about this.

00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:21,813
You're getting ready
for Christmas.

00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:23,548
You have
tons of ornaments downstairs.

00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:25,350
They're gonna
clutter your space and --

00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,986
CUBAN:
You're overthinking.

00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:29,254
You've got a solution

00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:31,856
and you're trying to
find the problem, okay?

00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,892
The pain point you solve
is time.

00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:36,795
You have to find places
where time is money.

00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:40,532
At home, for picking up for
Christmas, time is not money.

00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:42,867
Packing up for school,
time is not money.

00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,035
I respect your opinion,

00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,237
but I-I must say
that time is always money.

00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:49,174
Not --
You're always going to want
a more efficient, more --

00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:50,975
A neater way, a more
efficient way to do things.

00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:53,144
In fact, you can use it
over and over again.
A-as I listen to you, do --

00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:55,146
Do you have it in you

00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:57,048
to listen to advice
from somebody else

00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,283
that maybe you're wrong?

00:36:58,283 --> 00:37:00,618
That maybe there is
another way to be successful?

00:37:03,088 --> 00:37:04,622
I just sense
that you are that way.

00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,726
That I'm --

00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:10,862
Often, the raw emotion
eventually spills out.

00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:13,164
And maybe it's that
you believe so much

00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:16,067
that you can dominate
this market with a
more expensive box.

00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,336
I think people up here
have told you you can't do that.

00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:21,673
Well, then, I am very much
open to your suggestions.

00:37:24,943 --> 00:37:26,544
I am here to partner with you.

00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:29,280
If you feel that you have
a better way to do it,

00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,648
I am going to go all in.

00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:33,718
I will do whatever it is
that you want me to do.

00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:36,921
If you tell me to jump,
I won't ask you how high.

00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,456
I'll pull out the trampoline
and I'll --
Right.

00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:39,958
But, at some point,
you got to get the money.

00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:41,326
You've got
to close the deal.

00:37:41,326 --> 00:37:44,596
You've got to go find somebody
who's willing to write a check.

00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,664
But right now,
that person is not me.

00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:48,967
And so, for that reason,
I'm out.

00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:51,236
Thank you, Mark.

00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:52,470
You're welcome.

00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,240
Barbara, Lori, Kevin?

00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:59,077
CORCORAN: Um,
a couple things, Kaeya.

00:37:59,077 --> 00:38:00,378
You have
a wonderful idea,

00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:03,481
but you lack two traits that
every great entrepreneur has.

00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:04,883
One is the ability
to listen.

00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:07,385
The other thing is,
an entrepreneur,

00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:09,754
by instinct, whenever
they have an opportunity

00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:12,690
and someone says --
The Lowe's guy, what did he say?

00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:13,792
"I want your box."

00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,727
The only answer you give
as an entrepreneur

00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:17,462
is, "Yes, sir.
How many?"

00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:19,531
And then you find a way
to get it.

00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:21,065
But you weren't ready.

00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:23,568
I am -- I'm listening.
I understand.

00:38:23,568 --> 00:38:25,570
You don't mind if I speak
quite bluntly to you, right?

00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:26,838
You are not
an entrepreneur.

00:38:28,206 --> 00:38:29,674
I'm out.

00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:39,450
You don't mind if I speak
quite bluntly to you, right?

00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:40,718
You are not
an entrepreneur.

00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:43,087
I'm out.

00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:45,790
Now, I am worried
about what Barbara said

00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:48,159
'cause I felt
the same thing myself.

00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,228
You just don't listen.

00:38:50,228 --> 00:38:52,263
But I like your idea.

00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:53,665
I believe
that if your box

00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:56,367
was the same price as
what I sell my customers now,

00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:57,769
they would buy yours
instead.

00:38:57,769 --> 00:39:01,606
So, this challenge is all about
getting your price down.

00:39:01,606 --> 00:39:03,575
I'll make you an offer.

00:39:03,575 --> 00:39:06,811
I'll give you the $50,000.
I want 50%.

00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:07,846
[ scoffs ]

00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,647
50% --
I'm your partner.

00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:12,717
And I have no idea how much
trouble it's going to be

00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:15,353
to get the price down
to 56 cents.

00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,188
That's gonna be
your only task for me

00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,723
after I give you
that $50,000.

00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:21,059
I want you to go out
and figure it out

00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:23,595
and come back to me
when it's 56 cents.

00:39:23,595 --> 00:39:24,963
Are you willing
to do that?

00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,736
Is that the only offer
that I'm going to get?

00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:33,538
It may be.
I don't know.

00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,975
Lori?

00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:40,778
For me, there's some problems
with this.

00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:42,313
Come on, Lori.

00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:45,516
I think it's really clever.
You're really smart.

00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:48,953
And I like that you say,
"I'll jump as high as you want,"

00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:51,990
because that's the kind of
person that I like to work with.

00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,758
Just try it with me, Lori.

00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:56,094
It -- [ sighs ]
Please. just, please.

00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:58,196
You are a genius,
and I know it.

00:39:58,196 --> 00:39:59,330
I know everything

00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,466
about the companies
that you've worked with.

00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:02,901
If it's going
to get off the ground,

00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:04,535
I know that you're the partner
that I need.

00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:07,005
I-I promise you
you will not regret it.

00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:08,473
You will get your money back.

00:40:08,473 --> 00:40:10,675
I am -- I am the partner
for you.

00:40:10,675 --> 00:40:11,342
I'm out.

00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:16,814
You never say that
when you're negotiating

00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:18,116
after you've got an offer.

00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:20,084
'Cause you don't know
what the outcome is.

00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,287
You made a huge mistake.

00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:24,756
Please, Lori, please.
Just listen to me.

00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,758
I will work for you.
I will listen to you.

00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:31,596
I will do anything it takes.
I will get you your money back.

00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:36,034
Kaeya...

00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:39,437
...I'm gonna
make you an offer.

00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,240
The offer's
going to be this --

00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,444
$50,000,
40% of the business,

00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:49,414
contingent on
if we can figure out

00:40:49,414 --> 00:40:52,016
how to manufacture this
as a storage box.

00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:53,618
'Cause it's got problems.

00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:56,754
But you are the kind of person
I like to work with

00:40:56,754 --> 00:41:00,925
because I know that you will do
whatever it takes to get there

00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:02,961
no matter what.

00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:05,430
It's really gonna be
something to figure out,

00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:08,066
but I'm willing to take
the journey with you.

00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:17,241
Lori, you have a deal.

00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:18,810
Okay.

00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:22,213
Thank you so much.

00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:23,214
Thank you.

00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:25,450
We'll figure it out.

00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,324
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,426
Thank you.
[ sniffles ]

00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:39,597
CUBAN: She would have
benefited a whole lot more

00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:41,632
by going through this herself
'cause she's so smart

00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,234
she would have learned more
by figuring it out.

00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:45,436
But she'll also
learn a lot from me.

00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:47,538
Oh, I'm sure she will.
I thought --
You know,
sometimes it's better

00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:48,706
to be able to learn
from a good mentor

00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:50,441
than to fall
on your face.

00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:53,644
The truth is, unless you can
make these boxes for 56 cents,

00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:54,846
you will sell zero.

00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:56,481
We'll see down the road,
you know?

00:41:56,481 --> 00:41:58,249
You're braver than I am.
I couldn't have done it.

00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:02,754
What happened?
I got a deal.

00:42:02,754 --> 00:42:04,055
Oh, you did?

00:42:04,055 --> 00:42:05,757
Oh, I'm so happy.

00:42:05,757 --> 00:42:06,791
Awesome.

00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:07,892
What happened?
Who did you get it with?

00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:09,560
Lori.
Are you serious?

00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,995
We're so happy for you.

00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:13,564
MAJMUNDAR: Lori believe in me
and believed in my product,

00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:15,900
and Lori and I are gonna
make this the best
product it will be.
