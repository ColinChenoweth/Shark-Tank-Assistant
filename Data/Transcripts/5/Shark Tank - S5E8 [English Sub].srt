00:00:01,503 --> 00:00:02,672
Narrator:
  This is the Shark Tank,

00:00:02,672 --> 00:00:04,041
where hopeful entrepreneurs

00:00:04,041 --> 00:00:06,346
get a once-in-a-lifetime chance
  to pitch the sharks

00:00:06,346 --> 00:00:08,149
in hopes of getting
  an investment

00:00:08,149 --> 00:00:10,587
to start, grow,
  or save their businesses.

00:00:10,587 --> 00:00:13,527
Behold the biggest spectacle
  in history.

00:00:13,527 --> 00:00:16,165
[ scoffs ]
  Narrator: The entrepreneurs
  must convince a shark

00:00:16,165 --> 00:00:18,470
to invest the full amount
  they're asking for,

00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,474
or they'll walk away
  with nothing.

00:00:20,474 --> 00:00:21,944
This isn't about a product.

00:00:21,944 --> 00:00:24,515
This is about an empire.

00:00:24,515 --> 00:00:26,252
You're dead.

00:00:26,252 --> 00:00:28,089
You're gonna get
  knocked off like that.

00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:29,993
Narrator: If the sharks
  hear a great idea...

00:00:29,993 --> 00:00:33,600
which one of you sharks
  will marry Paparazzi Proposals?

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,539
Narrator: ...they're ready
  to invest using their own money.

00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:38,076
Get off your knees.
  Let's talk about money.

00:00:38,076 --> 00:00:39,880
And they're willing
  to fight each other

00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,015
for a piece of the action.

00:00:41,015 --> 00:00:42,718
You're being
  a hypocrite, Lori.

00:00:42,718 --> 00:00:44,021
Lori, you're being
  a hypocrite.
  No, I'm not
  being a hypocrite.

00:00:44,021 --> 00:00:45,490
Yes.
  You're interrupting me.

00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:46,626
So you haven't even heard
  what I'm saying yet.

00:00:46,626 --> 00:00:47,728
I heard
  what you said earlier.

00:00:47,728 --> 00:00:49,398
No one's even talked
  about the fact

00:00:49,398 --> 00:00:50,567
that he's asking
  over a million-dollar valuation.

00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:51,302
Enough!

00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:53,340
Take it or leave it.

00:00:54,508 --> 00:00:55,644
Narrator:
  Who are the sharks?

00:00:56,846 --> 00:01:00,187
They're self-made millionaire
  and billionaire investors

00:01:00,187 --> 00:01:02,691
who are entrepreneurs
  themselves.

00:01:02,691 --> 00:01:05,364
Kevin O'Leary
  is a venture capitalist

00:01:05,364 --> 00:01:07,201
who turned a $10,000 loan

00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:11,409
into a software business
  worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:13,446 --> 00:01:16,653
Barbara Corcoran went from
  waiting tables in manhattan

00:01:16,653 --> 00:01:19,558
to building the city's
  preeminent real-estate empire.

00:01:21,396 --> 00:01:24,134
Robert Herjavec, the son
  of an immigrant factory worker,

00:01:24,134 --> 00:01:26,238
is now a technology mogul

00:01:26,238 --> 00:01:30,781
Who sold his first internet
  companies for over $350 million.

00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:35,857
Lori Greiner, the queen of qvc,
  holds over 100 patents,

00:01:35,857 --> 00:01:38,062
and has launched
  over 300 products

00:01:38,062 --> 00:01:41,836
grossing over a half a billion
  dollars in retail sales.

00:01:41,836 --> 00:01:45,242
And Mark Cuban, notorious
  billionaire entrepreneur,

00:01:45,242 --> 00:01:47,681
tech guru,
  and the outspoken owner

00:01:47,681 --> 00:01:59,705
of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.

00:01:59,705 --> 00:02:01,876
First into the tank
  is an entrepreneur

00:02:01,876 --> 00:02:04,547
with a new way to serve
  an old-fashioned dessert.

00:02:16,404 --> 00:02:18,810
Are you guys ready
  for something good?

00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,414
Are you guys ready
  for something new?

00:02:21,414 --> 00:02:22,416
[ laughs ]

00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:24,154
My name is Sarah Schulz,

00:02:24,154 --> 00:02:27,727
and I am the founder, the baker,
  and the mastermind

00:02:27,727 --> 00:02:29,464
of Schulzies bread pudding.

00:02:29,464 --> 00:02:32,871
I'm seeking investment
  of $160,000

00:02:32,871 --> 00:02:35,977
for a 20% equity stake
  in Schulzies.

00:02:35,977 --> 00:02:39,818
Schulzies is rich, creamy,
  delicious, fresh bread pudding.

00:02:39,818 --> 00:02:42,056
I'll let your taste buds
  go for it,

00:02:42,056 --> 00:02:44,127
and you can see
  the proof is in the pudding.

00:02:44,127 --> 00:02:45,129
All right.

00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:47,033
Sweet Home Strawberry.

00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,202
Thank you, Sarah.

00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:50,472
And you have
  my Celestial Chocolate Chunk...

00:02:50,472 --> 00:02:52,243
GREINER: That is just what
  I wanted, looking at the sign.

00:02:52,243 --> 00:02:53,979
...with a caramel sauce.

00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:56,084
And for you, Mr. Wonderful,

00:02:56,084 --> 00:02:58,589
Coconut with a little bit
  of strawberry sauce.

00:02:58,589 --> 00:03:00,092
O'Leary: Thank you,
  thank you.
  Wow.

00:03:00,092 --> 00:03:01,661
This is
  the Caramel Charisma.

00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:03,599
Mm, thank you.

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,738
Mark,
  Radical Raspberry.
  There you go.

00:03:06,738 --> 00:03:08,508
Greiner:
  This is amazing.
  O'Leary: Sarah, it's amazing.

00:03:08,508 --> 00:03:09,911
Mm. Delicious.

00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:11,448
Cuban: Incredible.
  Oh, my God.

00:03:11,448 --> 00:03:13,184
How many calories
  in this?

00:03:13,184 --> 00:03:15,389
No calories, Kevin.
  [ laughs ] 9,000.
  Wow.

00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:16,658
This isn't bread pudding.

00:03:16,658 --> 00:03:18,127
There is a child here,

00:03:18,127 --> 00:03:20,231
so you won't look like this if
  you keep eating bread pudding.

00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:22,068
[ laughter ]

00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:23,939
Who's ready to build
  a bread-pudding empire with me?

00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:26,310
So, tell us
  what the business is?

00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,649
There's nothing like it
  on the market.

00:03:28,649 --> 00:03:32,924
People don't know what it is,
  so I need it to say,

00:03:32,924 --> 00:03:35,629
"here I am, world.
  I got bread pudding."

00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:37,332
You rented
  retail space?

00:03:37,332 --> 00:03:39,136
Not any old retail.

00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,373
I got on my bike
  in Venice Beach,

00:03:41,373 --> 00:03:44,179
and I found
  a little tiny window

00:03:44,179 --> 00:03:45,983
right across from Muscle Beach,
  where they work out,

00:03:45,983 --> 00:03:48,354
that I rented
  for about a year and a half.

00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:51,728
And I recently did
  a asset purchase agreement

00:03:51,728 --> 00:03:53,999
a little over a year ago
  and let someone else run it

00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:55,535
so I could really do
  my vision.

00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:57,205
You ran away
  from your business.

00:03:57,205 --> 00:04:00,378
No, not even close!

00:04:00,378 --> 00:04:01,580
Are you ready?

00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,349
Ready.

00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:04,586
I got my dream --

00:04:04,586 --> 00:04:06,891
A bread-pudding parlor,

00:04:06,891 --> 00:04:11,233
and it's in San Francisco,
  and it is beautiful.

00:04:11,233 --> 00:04:12,837
[ laughs ]

00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:14,373
But Sarah,
  is that a store?
  Greiner:
  Is this like a store?

00:04:14,373 --> 00:04:15,843
So, it's a store.

00:04:15,843 --> 00:04:17,712
O'Leary: Okay, okay.
  And so, we have
  the walk-up window.

00:04:17,712 --> 00:04:19,583
Sarah, remember the little
  window across from Muscle Beach?

00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,186
Yes.
  How many square feet
  was that?

00:04:21,186 --> 00:04:22,823
It was 140 square feet.

00:04:22,823 --> 00:04:24,426
140 square feet?

00:04:24,426 --> 00:04:25,996
Yeah, it's just
  this little tiny window --

00:04:25,996 --> 00:04:27,900
How many dollars
  in sales last year in that?

00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,471
Last year,
  it was $190,000.

00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:33,677
Sarah, how did you go from
  Venice Beach to San Francisco?

00:04:33,677 --> 00:04:36,316
So, San Francisco,
  it's part-Time home,

00:04:36,316 --> 00:04:39,991
and also, though, they have
  a really unique foodie market.

00:04:39,991 --> 00:04:41,460
Is your
  San Francisco store

00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,397
different from your
  Venice Beach store?

00:04:43,397 --> 00:04:46,002
It's a walk-Through,
  brick-and-mortar location.

00:04:46,002 --> 00:04:47,172
It has more flavors. You --

00:04:47,172 --> 00:04:48,340
How many square feet?

00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,244
San Francisco
  is 800 square feet.

00:04:50,244 --> 00:04:51,280
This is a mock-up,

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,549
so you could kind of
  generally see

00:04:52,549 --> 00:04:54,453
what is
  a bread-pudding parlor.

00:04:54,453 --> 00:04:57,392
So, you're a yogurt store
  with bread pudding?

00:04:57,392 --> 00:04:59,729
[ laughter ]
  O'Leary: Sarah.

00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:02,268
So, Sarah, stay focused
  on the numbers for a second.
  Yes.

00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:03,671
How much are you gonna rent
  that 800 square feet for?

00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:05,475
It's $3,200 a month.

00:05:05,475 --> 00:05:06,710
You mean, San Francisco
  is open now?

00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,779
Yes.

00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:09,983
What did it do in sales
  last month?

00:05:09,983 --> 00:05:13,256
So, last month,
  we did $30,000.

00:05:13,256 --> 00:05:15,361
That's --
  That's okay.

00:05:15,361 --> 00:05:16,797
That sounds
  pretty good to me.
  It does to me, too.

00:05:16,797 --> 00:05:18,534
It's good,
  but I'm not satisfied.

00:05:18,534 --> 00:05:19,870
I want more.

00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,942
I'm this entrepreneur
  that has ideas,

00:05:22,942 --> 00:05:24,713
and I'm a mover
  and a shaker.

00:05:24,713 --> 00:05:28,621
Okay, so here's
  a problem right now, all right?

00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:31,359
The way to look at it
  is dollars per square
  foot of sales.

00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:34,198
Correct.
  That's how you can become
  a franchisable business.

00:05:34,198 --> 00:05:37,404
Your first concept
  was to open up 140 square feet,

00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:41,512
and you were actually
  selling $1,300 a foot,

00:05:41,512 --> 00:05:43,851
which is
  very, very good.

00:05:43,851 --> 00:05:44,886
It was.
  Okay?

00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,823
Then you moved
  to San Francisco.

00:05:46,823 --> 00:05:48,493
Based on
  the first 3 months,

00:05:48,493 --> 00:05:50,096
you've dropped
  from $1,300

00:05:50,096 --> 00:05:52,234
down to $450
  per square foot of sales,

00:05:52,234 --> 00:05:53,536
which is not good.

00:05:53,536 --> 00:05:55,507
You're not gonna make
  any money this year

00:05:55,507 --> 00:05:57,946
if that store
  stays at that level,

00:05:57,946 --> 00:06:00,116
'cause you got to pay people,
  and you have to pay the rent.

00:06:00,116 --> 00:06:03,056
And you've got $200,000
  of capex to amortize.

00:06:03,056 --> 00:06:07,531
What happened between
  Muscle Beach and San Francisco?

00:06:07,531 --> 00:06:08,834
It's a whole new Market.

00:06:08,834 --> 00:06:10,770
Muscle Beach
  has the foot traffic.

00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,507
Then I moved
  to San Francisco.

00:06:12,507 --> 00:06:14,813
People haven't heard
  about me.

00:06:14,813 --> 00:06:17,551
I have spent no money
  in marketing whatsoever.

00:06:17,551 --> 00:06:19,021
Cuban: Let me
  ask you a question.

00:06:19,021 --> 00:06:20,257
How much money
  have you invested?

00:06:20,257 --> 00:06:23,162
I have put in $300,000.
  Whoa.

00:06:23,162 --> 00:06:26,435
I'm curious.
  Where did you get that money?

00:06:28,006 --> 00:06:32,982
It was from my dad, and that's
  why it's his name -- Schulzies.

00:06:32,982 --> 00:06:38,259
And as he passed, it was a gift,
  and I invested it all.

00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:40,597
That was the total amount
  he left you?

00:06:40,597 --> 00:06:42,868
Yes.

00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:48,112
Okay, Sarah, what's missing
  in your presentation

00:06:48,112 --> 00:06:51,852
is sort of the
  operational-execution aspect.

00:06:51,852 --> 00:06:54,258
It's not investable,
  not for me.

00:06:54,258 --> 00:06:56,629
I don't know that you're
  gonna execute a business plan

00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:58,766
because there isn't
  a business plan yet.

00:06:58,766 --> 00:06:59,768
Just my opinion.

00:07:01,872 --> 00:07:03,141
I'm out.

00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:04,611
Okay.

00:07:04,611 --> 00:07:07,249
For me, I don't doubt
  at all

00:07:07,249 --> 00:07:10,055
that you don't love
  your bread pudding.
  Mm-hmm.

00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,224
And absolutely delicious.

00:07:11,224 --> 00:07:12,594
Right.
  Cuban: Amazing.

00:07:12,594 --> 00:07:15,065
But I couldn't imagine making
  money with you, for some reason.

00:07:15,065 --> 00:07:17,002
I'm gonna have to trust
  my instinct on that. I'm out.

00:07:17,002 --> 00:07:20,242
And there is not a question
  in my mind

00:07:20,242 --> 00:07:22,279
that this isn't
  just about a business.

00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:23,649
This isn't about a product.

00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:26,187
This is about an empire.

00:07:26,187 --> 00:07:29,093
Your passion for the product
  is fantastic.

00:07:29,093 --> 00:07:32,701
I don't think you did
  a -- a great job

00:07:32,701 --> 00:07:35,940
in showing me a business plan
  that I can get excited about.

00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,942
It's there.

00:07:36,942 --> 00:07:38,813
It's not.
  The direction's there.

00:07:38,813 --> 00:07:40,482
Sarah,
  it's not there today.
  All right.

00:07:40,482 --> 00:07:41,317
I'm out.

00:07:41,317 --> 00:07:43,990
All right.

00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,565
Look, the problem is you,
  by yourself.

00:07:48,565 --> 00:07:52,173
You need a complementary partner
  who can guide you.

00:07:52,173 --> 00:07:54,010
You need that desperately,
  desperately.

00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:57,516
You have a great idea.
  You have a great opportunity.

00:07:57,516 --> 00:08:00,824
Your biggest risk is you.

00:08:00,824 --> 00:08:02,092
For that reason,
  I'm out.

00:08:02,092 --> 00:08:03,228
All right.

00:08:03,228 --> 00:08:04,730
Greiner:
  I love the saying,

00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,334
"Don't go
  where the path may lead.

00:08:06,334 --> 00:08:09,474
Go where there is no path,
  and leave a Trail."

00:08:09,474 --> 00:08:13,582
You could be on the brink
  of something fantastic,

00:08:13,582 --> 00:08:16,454
but I wish
  you were more there.

00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,794
I-I see you
  as teetering right now.

00:08:19,794 --> 00:08:23,101
For me, it's not the right time
  to invest in your company.

00:08:23,101 --> 00:08:25,706
And so for that reason,
  I'm out.

00:08:29,413 --> 00:08:30,616
Okay.

00:08:30,616 --> 00:08:32,086
Great product.

00:08:32,086 --> 00:08:33,188
Greiner:
  Yeah, great product.

00:08:33,188 --> 00:08:34,290
Thanks, Sarah.
  Herjavec:
  Thank you, Sarah.

00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,659
Watch out
  for bread-pudding parlors.

00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:36,661
Corcoran: Okay.
  Everywhere.

00:08:40,235 --> 00:08:41,771
I want to get up
  and go try more.

00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:42,806
To hear them tell me

00:08:42,806 --> 00:08:44,610
How great
  Schulzies bread pudding is,

00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,612
it was confirmation.

00:08:45,612 --> 00:08:46,915
I will never stop Schulzies

00:08:46,915 --> 00:08:49,186
until it needs to get
  to where it needs to be.

00:08:49,186 --> 00:08:50,322
Radical Raspberry.

00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:51,658
Greiner:
  Look at us pigs.

00:08:51,658 --> 00:08:54,230
Oh, don't double-dip.
  [ laughs ]

00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,465
What do you mean?

00:09:03,113 --> 00:09:04,317
My name's James Ambler.

00:09:04,317 --> 00:09:06,219
I live in New York City
  with my wife, Kate,

00:09:06,219 --> 00:09:08,425
and my 1-year-old daughter,
  Milla,

00:09:08,425 --> 00:09:10,362
and I am the proud owner
  of Paparazzi Proposals.

00:09:12,198 --> 00:09:13,602
I've been
  a paparazzi photographer

00:09:13,602 --> 00:09:15,171
for the last six years
  in New York City.

00:09:15,171 --> 00:09:16,507
Being a paparazzi photographer

00:09:16,507 --> 00:09:18,478
has really helped me
  in building this business.

00:09:18,478 --> 00:09:20,181
I don't get flustered
  under pressure,

00:09:20,181 --> 00:09:21,350
and no matter what happens,

00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:24,255
we're always gonna get
  that shot.

00:09:24,255 --> 00:09:27,896
I'm amazed that no one's really
  come up with this idea before.

00:09:27,896 --> 00:09:29,399
Since we've started it,
  there's a lot of companies

00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,936
that are trying to copy
  what we do,

00:09:30,936 --> 00:09:35,011
but no one can capture the
  moment like Paparazzi Proposals.

00:09:35,011 --> 00:09:37,616
Tickle, tickle,
  tickle, tickle. Yeah.

00:09:37,616 --> 00:09:39,887
I've risked a lot
  to make this dream come True.

00:09:39,887 --> 00:09:42,291
I gave up a very stable, steady
  job. I have a young family.

00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,629
We have another child
  on the way,

00:09:44,629 --> 00:09:46,868
and so I have a lot riding
  on the success of this business.

00:09:46,868 --> 00:09:49,372
We're really hoping
  to get a deal with the sharks.

00:09:49,372 --> 00:09:51,176
I hope that the romance
  of it all

00:09:51,176 --> 00:09:53,180
will manage to sweep
  a few of them off their feet.

00:10:09,245 --> 00:10:11,049
Hello,
  my name's James Ambler,

00:10:11,049 --> 00:10:13,620
and I'm the proud owner
  of Paparazzi Proposals.

00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:18,497
We are asking for $250,000
  for 20% equity in our company.

00:10:18,497 --> 00:10:20,668
I've been
  a paparazzi photographer

00:10:20,668 --> 00:10:21,870
for the last six years,

00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,607
and now I use
  these sneaky skills

00:10:23,607 --> 00:10:25,511
to help capture
  that amazing question

00:10:25,511 --> 00:10:26,980
that every girl wants to hear.

00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,684
Paparazzi Proposals came about

00:10:28,684 --> 00:10:31,156
four years ago
  when I proposed to my wife,

00:10:31,156 --> 00:10:32,358
and after we started to tell

00:10:32,358 --> 00:10:34,129
friends and family
  about our engagement,

00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:36,031
the first question
  that everybody asked was,

00:10:36,031 --> 00:10:37,100
"How did he do it?"

00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,370
this got me thinking.

00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,941
It would have been so cool
  to have some pictures

00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:42,278
of me down on one knee.

00:10:42,278 --> 00:10:44,649
So, I started looking into it
  and researching to see

00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:46,753
if there was anybody
  or any company out there

00:10:46,753 --> 00:10:48,824
offering this unique service,
  and there wasn't.

00:10:48,824 --> 00:10:53,065
So, in June 2011,
  we launched Paparazzi Proposals.

00:10:53,065 --> 00:10:54,936
And I've spent
  the last two years

00:10:54,936 --> 00:10:57,341
marketing and branding
  this unique company in America.

00:10:57,341 --> 00:11:00,381
So, sharks, it just leaves me
  with just one very big question

00:11:00,381 --> 00:11:01,616
that I need to ask you.

00:11:01,616 --> 00:11:02,952
I'm rather nervous about it.

00:11:02,952 --> 00:11:04,154
[ laughter ]

00:11:04,154 --> 00:11:05,591
Which one of you sharks

00:11:05,591 --> 00:11:07,027
will marry Paparazzi Proposals?

00:11:07,027 --> 00:11:09,732
[ laughter ]

00:11:09,732 --> 00:11:11,168
Get off your knees.
  Let's talk about money.

00:11:11,168 --> 00:11:13,707
Okay, why do you need
  a quarter of a million dollars?

00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:15,376
We've really been focusing
  this business

00:11:15,376 --> 00:11:17,480
in New York City
  where I'm based,

00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,051
and we want
  to use that money

00:11:19,051 --> 00:11:20,754
to help expand
  into other cities.

00:11:20,754 --> 00:11:21,890
The other angle
  that we've done

00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,660
is we go into jewelry stores,

00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,532
and we educate the jewelers
  about our service.

00:11:26,532 --> 00:11:27,668
The key success to this

00:11:27,668 --> 00:11:29,672
is getting jewelers excited
  and on board

00:11:29,672 --> 00:11:32,010
and wanting to put this
  into their clients' hand

00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,012
as they give them
  their engagement ring.

00:11:33,012 --> 00:11:34,314
What's in it for them?

00:11:34,314 --> 00:11:36,920
We offered a kickback
  for the jewelers to start with.

00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,424
With the social marketing
  and the media that's out there,

00:11:39,424 --> 00:11:41,262
this is a great product

00:11:41,262 --> 00:11:43,699
for a jeweler to advertise
  their -- their product.

00:11:43,699 --> 00:11:45,403
Okay.
  What were your sales?

00:11:45,403 --> 00:11:48,609
We did just under $100,000
  in sales in the last two years.

00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,617
Why are you so focused
  on the jewelers?

00:11:52,617 --> 00:11:54,388
'Cause I think
  it's key to the success.

00:11:54,388 --> 00:11:57,962
Why not wedding shows?
  Why not wedding magazines?

00:11:57,962 --> 00:12:00,366
Oh, yeah, 'cause lots of guys
  watch those.

00:12:00,366 --> 00:12:03,105
"Oh, wait, the game's up,
  but I'm gonna get proposed."
  Well, no,
  but hang on, Mark.

00:12:03,105 --> 00:12:04,641
"Let's turn on
  the Wedding Channel."

00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:07,013
Well, you know, I see
  this as, like, a cross
  between a private eye...

00:12:07,013 --> 00:12:09,584
Yeah.
  ...and a wedding
  photographer...

00:12:09,584 --> 00:12:11,522
Yeah, good analogy.
  ...because it has to look
  really good, quality.

00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,960
Exactly.
  But they
  have to hide out.

00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,100
The main idea is, guys need help
  planning their proposals,

00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,636
so we find out his ideas,

00:12:18,636 --> 00:12:21,241
where -- w-where and how
  he might be looking to propose.

00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,679
We offer him help
  with any kind of logistics,

00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,781
if he wants flowers there.

00:12:24,781 --> 00:12:27,019
So you give them
  suggestions.
  Yeah.

00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:29,491
You aid with flowers
  or something romantic,

00:12:29,491 --> 00:12:31,228
and then you also are there
  to capture the moment.

00:12:31,228 --> 00:12:32,230
Exactly.

00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,232
Part of the reason

00:12:33,232 --> 00:12:34,835
that we're looking
  for investment

00:12:34,835 --> 00:12:36,438
is also to partner
  with someone

00:12:36,438 --> 00:12:38,676
who may be able
  to put us into Kay's and Jared.

00:12:38,676 --> 00:12:42,350
That'd be a huge, huge, huge,
  enormous mistake,

00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,953
because if you did,

00:12:43,953 --> 00:12:47,159
and they put it in 20 stores,
  you're dead, right?

00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:48,194
Really?

00:12:48,194 --> 00:12:49,398
Because how are you
  going to keep up?

00:12:49,398 --> 00:12:51,769
Let's just say they brought you
  five deals a week,

00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:53,906
and you're in charge
  with managing, quality,

00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:56,578
and making sure they're all
  fulfilled properly...
  right.

00:12:56,578 --> 00:12:58,816
...and following up
  and making sure that
  everything works, right?

00:12:58,816 --> 00:13:01,054
Exactly.
  A business
  can die from success.

00:13:01,054 --> 00:13:02,424
Well, but he also
  could handle it.

00:13:02,424 --> 00:13:04,494
Oh, there's no way,
  there's no way.
  Wait, wait.

00:13:04,494 --> 00:13:06,732
In a service-oriented,
  creative business,

00:13:06,732 --> 00:13:08,001
if you make a deal
  with a big retailer

00:13:08,001 --> 00:13:09,136
who's gonna put you
  in 20 stores,

00:13:09,136 --> 00:13:10,973
you don't have time
  to figure that out.

00:13:10,973 --> 00:13:12,677
But wait a minute,
  time out. Time out.
  And that's a great way
  to lose customers.

00:13:12,677 --> 00:13:13,946
O'Leary: I don't know
  why you guys are fighting.

00:13:13,946 --> 00:13:15,515
No one's even talked
  about the fact

00:13:15,515 --> 00:13:17,019
that he's asking
  over a million-dollar
  valuation of this idea.

00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:18,823
Whoa, Kevin. Why is it worth
  that much money? $1.2 million.

00:13:18,823 --> 00:13:20,559
It isn't. It isn't. It isn't.
  There's so much competition.
  Greiner: Wait.

00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:21,962
Herjavec:
  James, speak to that.

00:13:21,962 --> 00:13:23,431
Why is your business
  worth $1. --
  time out, whoa, whoa.

00:13:23,431 --> 00:13:24,768
I want to go back to what Mark
  was saying.

00:13:24,768 --> 00:13:26,370
Can I -- can I -- I'll be
  with you very shortly.

00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,575
Can I just answer
  Lori's question first?

00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:30,479
Greiner: back to what -- back to
  what mark was saying, though --
  We will talk about
  your valuation...

00:13:30,479 --> 00:13:31,447
I know, Kevin.
  ...which, by the way,
  is insane.

00:13:31,447 --> 00:13:32,851
I know, thank you.

00:13:32,851 --> 00:13:34,019
No, it is.
  We've got to deal with it.

00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:35,055
It's so insane,
  I have to hear now why.

00:13:35,055 --> 00:13:36,758
Yeah, well, I'd just like
  to address Lori,

00:13:36,758 --> 00:13:38,796
who actually
  was trying to --
  then you're avoiding
  the real question.

00:13:38,796 --> 00:13:40,098
Thank you very much.
  No, no,
  I will come back to you.

00:13:40,098 --> 00:13:41,667
I do want to go back to that,
  to Kevin's point.

00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:43,438
That's
  very kind of you.
  But the thing is,

00:13:43,438 --> 00:13:45,509
I see this as something
  that you could fully manage.

00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:48,114
He could have maybe
  40 different things written up

00:13:48,114 --> 00:13:50,752
as ways
  in which to propose.

00:13:50,752 --> 00:13:52,456
It's a template. He could have
  his staff use it.

00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,995
He could operate
  out of New York, Mark.

00:13:54,995 --> 00:13:56,764
That's exactly the model
  that we're going to use.
  He could operate
  out of his home.

00:13:56,764 --> 00:13:58,434
You don't even need
  a lot of office space.
  But what's your point?

00:13:58,434 --> 00:14:01,908
My point is is that he
  could easily scale this
  fast and quick.

00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:03,144
You'd get crushed.

00:14:04,413 --> 00:14:06,784
Now, look. I love
  two industries very much.

00:14:06,784 --> 00:14:09,056
I love weddings,
  and I love people dying.

00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,091
You know why?

00:14:10,091 --> 00:14:12,196
Because when both
  of those happen,

00:14:12,196 --> 00:14:15,101
people make stupid decisions,
  emotional decisions,

00:14:15,101 --> 00:14:16,571
not financial decisions.

00:14:16,571 --> 00:14:18,441
And because
  that is the case,

00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,712
there's huge industries
  behind both of those,

00:14:20,712 --> 00:14:23,685
including a whole ton of
  wedding photographers out there

00:14:23,685 --> 00:14:25,322
that could
  easily do this.

00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:28,428
And I don't really see you
  being significantly different.

00:14:28,428 --> 00:14:32,101
You are not worth
  $1.25 million, my friend.

00:14:32,101 --> 00:14:33,571
Okay.
  I'm out.

00:14:33,571 --> 00:14:35,909
Thank you very much.

00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:37,879
Look, James, you should
  be growing organically,

00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:39,717
taking your wins
  from one city to the next,

00:14:39,717 --> 00:14:41,754
because if it truly
  can scale,

00:14:41,754 --> 00:14:45,294
and it truly can grow,
  like Lori seems to think...
  Yep.

00:14:45,294 --> 00:14:47,966
...then you could make
  a boatload of money in New York,

00:14:47,966 --> 00:14:49,035
then move to Chicago,

00:14:49,035 --> 00:14:51,339
boatload in Chicago,
  then move to L.A.,

00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:53,678
rather than trying to hit
  all these cities at one time.

00:14:53,678 --> 00:14:54,913
Right.
  And so, because
  I don't think

00:14:54,913 --> 00:14:57,285
this is
  an investment conducive

00:14:57,285 --> 00:14:59,322
to my getting a return,
  I'm out.

00:14:59,322 --> 00:15:00,692
Okay, thank you
  very much for your time.

00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:01,861
You're welcome
  very much.

00:15:01,861 --> 00:15:04,332
Well, James, I think
  you're a fantastic operator.

00:15:04,332 --> 00:15:05,568
Thank you.

00:15:05,568 --> 00:15:09,977
I just can't get over
  the $250,000.

00:15:09,977 --> 00:15:11,747
I figure
  it has a potential to earn

00:15:11,747 --> 00:15:16,957
uh, a lot more
  than half a million.

00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,395
James, I think you're nuts
  going out of New York

00:15:19,395 --> 00:15:21,299
until you've saturated
  that market,

00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:24,405
and this is not a business
  for an investor.

00:15:24,405 --> 00:15:27,111
This is your business,
  your concierge service.

00:15:27,111 --> 00:15:28,647
I can't imagine
  making money on this business

00:15:28,647 --> 00:15:30,417
as an outsider
  coming in.

00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:31,419
I'm out.

00:15:31,419 --> 00:15:32,756
Okay. Thank you,
  again, Barbara.

00:15:32,756 --> 00:15:34,092
You're welcome,
  my friend.

00:15:37,264 --> 00:15:41,573
You know, I think the idea
  is amazing.

00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:43,677
Thank you.
  I think
  it's a home run.

00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:46,951
The romantic in me,
  and I think, Barb, you -- You --

00:15:46,951 --> 00:15:50,457
Romantic, too --
  I'm not a romantic,
  definitely not.

00:15:50,457 --> 00:15:53,430
Well,
  the romantic in me --

00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:56,403
I think this is fantastic.

00:15:56,403 --> 00:16:00,411
To have a memory
  of your proposal is great.

00:16:00,411 --> 00:16:03,049
The problem that I have
  is your valuation.

00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:06,856
I don't see where you need
  the $250,000.

00:16:06,856 --> 00:16:08,927
That's my problem...
  okay.

00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:10,397
...because I don't think
  that you need to put

00:16:10,397 --> 00:16:12,835
a lot of money
  into this business at all.

00:16:12,835 --> 00:16:15,507
How's he going to train
  all the jewelers that you
  thought was a great idea?

00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:17,311
I still think
  it's a great idea.
  How is he gonna
  train them

00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:19,482
and send people
  to introduce it?
  And I think you should go
  to tuxedo places.

00:16:19,482 --> 00:16:20,651
I'll tell you
  the difference.

00:16:20,651 --> 00:16:24,157
When I started, I,
  just myself, figured it out.

00:16:24,157 --> 00:16:25,794
And you know what, Mark?
  I pounded the pavement.

00:16:25,794 --> 00:16:27,898
I went, 21 cities, 18 days.
  You're -- You're
  missing the point.

00:16:27,898 --> 00:16:30,270
You're being a hypocrite, Lori.
  Lori, you're being a hypocrite.
  No, I'm not
  being a hypocrite.

00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,708
Yes, you're saying he's got
  the right idea to scale --
  but you're being rude
  because you're interrupting me.

00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,679
You're saying he's got
  the right idea to scale,

00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:36,148
but then you're telling him
  he doesn't need the money.

00:16:36,148 --> 00:16:37,618
Wait.
  But you've got to go out
  and train everybody.

00:16:37,618 --> 00:16:38,787
Wait, wait.
  No, you're saying that.

00:16:38,787 --> 00:16:40,557
That's not
  what I'm saying.
  You said it.

00:16:40,557 --> 00:16:42,227
You're interrupting me.
  So you haven't even heard
  what I'm saying yet.

00:16:42,227 --> 00:16:44,331
I heard
  what you said earlier...
  No, you need to stop.

00:16:44,331 --> 00:16:47,136
...that it was a great,
  scalable idea.
  Time out, Mark.

00:16:47,136 --> 00:16:49,307
So, he doesn't have to go
  to these other cities --

00:16:49,307 --> 00:16:50,544
But --
  Okay, so let's just say
  within New York,

00:16:50,544 --> 00:16:52,413
all the different
  jewelry companies.

00:16:52,413 --> 00:16:54,050
But you know what?
  You -- but you said
  it was a great idea

00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,954
to go
  to the different jewelers.
  He finds who is --

00:16:55,954 --> 00:16:57,625
Who -- Who's the top buyer
  for Kay jewelers.

00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,695
He finds
  who's the top buyer.
  What's a buyer gonna do?

00:16:59,695 --> 00:17:01,666
It's the people who sell it
  that are gonna do the work.

00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,870
What I'm saying is, he goes in,
  he sells it to them.

00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,707
They get
  their staff enlisted.

00:17:05,707 --> 00:17:07,845
The staff then --
  are you kidding me?

00:17:07,845 --> 00:17:09,214
No, I'm not kidding you.
  I did it myself.

00:17:09,214 --> 00:17:10,784
So the buyer -- the buyer
  of a jewelry company...
  mark.

00:17:10,784 --> 00:17:12,922
...is gonna go to the people
  who run the retail floor...
  I went --

00:17:12,922 --> 00:17:14,558
...and tell them
  to train the retail sales people

00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:15,928
to sell the service.
  Yes, absolutely.

00:17:15,928 --> 00:17:17,497
If it's an initiative
  that that store wants to do,

00:17:17,497 --> 00:17:19,434
and they make a kickback,
  absolutely.

00:17:19,434 --> 00:17:21,405
I've seen it done
  all the time.
  O'Leary: Why are you
  fighting about this

00:17:21,405 --> 00:17:24,010
when the whole business
  isn't worth $250,000?
  Look. Wait.

00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,615
I just wish you'd come in here
  with a different offer.

00:17:26,615 --> 00:17:28,118
You simply say to him,

00:17:28,118 --> 00:17:31,993
"I'll give you $250,000
  for 250% of this company."

00:17:31,993 --> 00:17:34,832
[ laughs ]
  That's the only way
  you can do this deal.

00:17:34,832 --> 00:17:38,339
For me
  to give you $250,000,

00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:41,244
I would want
  a lot bigger piece of the pie.

00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:52,467
Narrator: Three sharks are out.

00:17:52,467 --> 00:17:54,170
Lori seems interested,

00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:58,145
but the 20% stake
  James is offering is too small.

00:17:58,145 --> 00:18:01,151
For me
  to give you $250,000,

00:18:01,151 --> 00:18:04,056
I would want
  a lot bigger piece of the pie

00:18:04,056 --> 00:18:06,895
because I feel like
  I could show you

00:18:06,895 --> 00:18:09,534
how to take this business and
  quickly get it off the ground

00:18:09,534 --> 00:18:11,371
without needing
  a big staff.

00:18:11,371 --> 00:18:13,242
So, I will
  make you an offer.

00:18:13,242 --> 00:18:14,244
Okay.

00:18:14,244 --> 00:18:16,615
I'm offering you
  $250,000,

00:18:16,615 --> 00:18:19,287
but I'm gonna want 50%

00:18:19,287 --> 00:18:23,996
because I see us winding up
  being equal partners.

00:18:23,996 --> 00:18:26,535
James, your business isn't even
  worth half a million right now,

00:18:26,535 --> 00:18:27,370
and yet you've
  just got that offer.

00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:28,639
Are you
  out of your mind?

00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:30,241
It doesn't make sense that you
  wouldn't take that offer.

00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:31,745
Ambler: I'm very humbled

00:18:31,745 --> 00:18:34,718
'cause this has been
  my heart and soul for two years.

00:18:34,718 --> 00:18:36,588
This has to work.

00:18:36,588 --> 00:18:38,291
But part of the reason
  this has to work

00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,328
is because I have to believe
  and trust in myself.

00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:43,469
I have to hold my head high,
  and I have to respect myself.

00:18:43,469 --> 00:18:45,940
50% equity, it's just
  not gonna work for me.

00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,677
So, if there's
  a negotiation

00:18:47,677 --> 00:18:50,215
that we can maybe start
  to do a little dance --

00:18:50,215 --> 00:18:52,185
Well, the negotiating works
  with you making a counteroffer.

00:18:52,185 --> 00:18:55,024
I think there's a different way
  to structure it, Lori.

00:18:55,024 --> 00:18:56,494
Oh, no question you think
  there's a different way
  to structure it.

00:18:56,494 --> 00:18:57,730
And so let me explain

00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,199
what would be more interesting
  for your money,

00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,535
because I'm very married --
  married --
  Ohh!

00:19:00,535 --> 00:19:02,439
I'm very married to mine,
  and we're very happy together.

00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:04,209
You know how you know
  it's a bad deal?

00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,746
No, it's gonna be
  a great deal.
  Kevin's talking.

00:19:05,746 --> 00:19:07,182
Do you want to
  hear it, or not?

00:19:07,182 --> 00:19:08,451
Sure, why not?
  Greiner:
  I want to hear it.

00:19:08,451 --> 00:19:10,321
Okay.
  I'll go in with Lori.

00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:12,894
And I'll slightly change
  the structure, all right?
  [ laughs ]

00:19:12,894 --> 00:19:15,465
We will give you $50,000

00:19:15,465 --> 00:19:17,702
for a third of the business,
  all right?

00:19:17,702 --> 00:19:19,139
That's the equity piece.

00:19:19,139 --> 00:19:23,447
And we'll loan you
  $200,000 as you need it.

00:19:23,447 --> 00:19:26,720
That way, we can actually
  make a deal that makes sense

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,128
because your deal doesn't.

00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:34,336
Well, you know,
  I rarely agree with Kevin.
  Ambler: Okay.

00:19:34,336 --> 00:19:37,108
But I think that was
  a good, creative, new offer.

00:19:37,108 --> 00:19:39,046
O'Leary: Thank you. Are you
  interested in partnering?

00:19:39,046 --> 00:19:41,283
I am interested
  in partnering with him.

00:19:41,283 --> 00:19:43,454
So, he's valuing
  you company

00:19:43,454 --> 00:19:45,124
at less than the cash
  you were asking for coming in.
  Yeah, I was -- I know.

00:19:45,124 --> 00:19:46,227
Correct, my friend.

00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:49,199
Let me call your wife.

00:19:49,199 --> 00:19:50,335
[ laughter ]

00:19:50,335 --> 00:19:52,706
Um, can I just talk
  before you contact my wife?

00:19:52,706 --> 00:19:55,211
You may.
  Yeah, thank you.

00:19:55,211 --> 00:19:57,182
Um, Robert,
  you were on the fence.

00:20:00,188 --> 00:20:03,995
I'll give you $100,000
  under the same terms.

00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:05,865
It's a very clever way
  to structure the deal.

00:20:05,865 --> 00:20:06,867
Thank you.

00:20:06,867 --> 00:20:08,804
So, I'll give you
  $100,000

00:20:08,804 --> 00:20:11,243
for one-third
  of the business today

00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,812
and loan you the rest
  as you need it

00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:13,915
to expand
  the business.

00:20:17,389 --> 00:20:19,660
So, I've got
  a counteroffer for you.

00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:23,300
Lori, partner with Robert,
  and we'll do a deal.

00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,137
'cause Lori brings so much
  to this table.

00:20:25,137 --> 00:20:27,174
Do you
  not want my offer?

00:20:27,174 --> 00:20:28,444
I don't not want it.

00:20:28,444 --> 00:20:30,415
I would just like to see
  what Lori thinks about that.

00:20:30,415 --> 00:20:32,251
Do the deal with Lori. Robert,
  let her do the deal with Lori.

00:20:32,251 --> 00:20:34,756
So, my offer isn't good enough
  unless I bring Lori in.
  No, no, no, not at all.

00:20:34,756 --> 00:20:36,961
But I'm
  a stopgap for you.

00:20:36,961 --> 00:20:39,432
Yeah, you're the girl
  that didn't get the
  proposal, but don't worry.

00:20:39,432 --> 00:20:41,804
Stay -- stick around
  in case the first one says no.

00:20:41,804 --> 00:20:43,841
I'm -- I'm not good
  at playing second fiddle.

00:20:43,841 --> 00:20:45,444
I thought I made you
  a very fair offer

00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:50,053
when these guys didn't give you
  the value you deserve today.

00:20:50,053 --> 00:20:51,322
Take it or leave it.

00:20:51,322 --> 00:20:53,594
Thank you.

00:20:53,594 --> 00:20:55,564
I will give you an answer
  very shortly.

00:20:55,564 --> 00:20:57,034
Ohh!

00:20:57,034 --> 00:20:59,572
James, I'll give you
  an answer right now.

00:20:59,572 --> 00:21:01,944
I'm out.

00:21:01,944 --> 00:21:04,382
So, all roads be,
  as they are,

00:21:04,382 --> 00:21:07,488
leading back to Mr. Wonderful,
  yet again.

00:21:07,488 --> 00:21:13,433
So now you're back
  to the original offer, $50,000.

00:21:13,433 --> 00:21:15,170
Your offer's
  ridiculous.

00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:18,209
An additional $200,000
  as a loan as you need it.

00:21:18,209 --> 00:21:20,982
Yeah,
  that's horrible.
  Then why don't you
  make an offer?

00:21:20,982 --> 00:21:23,119
Instead of
  insulting my offer.

00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:24,588
I don't want him
  to make a stupid mistake!
  CORCORAN: Let him answer.

00:21:24,588 --> 00:21:26,092
Greiner: Why are you saying
  he's making a mistake?

00:21:26,092 --> 00:21:27,896
Because I think he's
  making a horrid mistake
  if he does 50k for --

00:21:27,896 --> 00:21:28,998
he has two
  very smart sharks here.
  That's fine.

00:21:28,998 --> 00:21:30,634
O'Leary: Then make him
  a better offer.

00:21:30,634 --> 00:21:31,602
Enough!

00:21:31,602 --> 00:21:34,809
Calm down.
  What do you want to do?

00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:36,345
I want to add
  one thing.

00:21:36,345 --> 00:21:39,752
I started grassroots --
  One product, one idea --

00:21:39,752 --> 00:21:41,889
and I had to tackle
  everything to get out
  there in the market...

00:21:41,889 --> 00:21:44,628
we already heard that story,
  Lori. What are you gonna do?

00:21:44,628 --> 00:21:46,833
...to build
  a $500-Million brand.
  We've heard this story already,
  Lori. What are we gonna do?

00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,238
So he's going to benefit greatly
  from what's right here.

00:21:49,238 --> 00:21:51,007
What I know
  that you can do --

00:21:51,007 --> 00:21:54,815
James, you lost -- You lost
  one offer because you -- You
  weren't clear and concise.

00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:57,521
This is like
  a marriage proposal.

00:21:57,521 --> 00:22:00,660
Would the deal go down to 30%,
  we have a deal.

00:22:04,201 --> 00:22:08,810
Because I know it's 33.3%,
  but I came in here 30%.

00:22:11,349 --> 00:22:13,853
We're good
  with that.
  We're good with that.

00:22:13,853 --> 00:22:16,291
Done.
  Who wants the ring?

00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,995
[ laughs ]
  we get the ring.

00:22:17,995 --> 00:22:19,732
Herjavec: Wow.
  What?
  O'Leary: I'll give it
  to my sharkette partner.

00:22:19,732 --> 00:22:21,636
I don't get that.

00:22:21,636 --> 00:22:23,439
Thank you for marrying
  Paparazzi Proposals.

00:22:23,439 --> 00:22:24,608
Ah! Thank you.

00:22:24,608 --> 00:22:25,777
Thank you so much.
  I really appreciate it.

00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,380
I think
  I'm going to cry.

00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,816
Thank you.
  Thank you very much
  for taking the time.

00:22:28,816 --> 00:22:30,487
Thank you. Good luck.
  I really appreciate it.

00:22:30,487 --> 00:22:32,558
Corcoran: Good luck.
  Thank you.

00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:35,062
Ambler: I'm really surprised
  I made a deal with Kevin,

00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,601
'cause I was really going
  after Lori and maybe Robert,

00:22:37,601 --> 00:22:39,504
but Robert got his knickers
  in a twist

00:22:39,504 --> 00:22:41,041
and decided
  to go home early.

00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:43,045
Greiner:
  I'm making a proclamation.

00:22:43,045 --> 00:22:44,949
A year from now,
  this is gonna be huge.

00:22:44,949 --> 00:22:46,852
And you know, Lori,
  he saved your Butt.

00:22:46,852 --> 00:22:48,422
Him restructuring
  the deal --

00:22:48,422 --> 00:22:51,595
You were about to go down that
  path and make a stupid deal.

00:22:51,595 --> 00:22:53,298
No.
  Thank god he jumped in,
  definitely.

00:22:53,298 --> 00:22:56,939
I never make deals
  that I think are stupid.
  I hate to admit it,
  but he did.

00:22:56,939 --> 00:22:58,710
He got you
  the right deal on that.
  I do what I believe in.

00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,014
Barbara, kiss the ring.

00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:09,932
Narrator: Last season,
  Rabbi Moshe Weiss made a deal

00:23:09,932 --> 00:23:12,838
with Daymond for his ipad
  accessory, the soundbender.

00:23:12,838 --> 00:23:15,476
It clips right onto the back
  magnetically, beautifully,

00:23:15,476 --> 00:23:17,981
reflecting the sound
  right towards you.

00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:19,751
Narrator: Let's see
  what he's doing now.

00:23:22,924 --> 00:23:25,529
Weiss: Who would have thought
  that, in only one year,

00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,101
a Rabbi
  from St. Paul, minnesota,

00:23:28,101 --> 00:23:30,906
would be flying down
  to New York City

00:23:30,906 --> 00:23:33,045
for a sales meeting
  with Daymond John?

00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:34,047
Daymond!
  [ Laughs ]

00:23:34,047 --> 00:23:35,949
Moshe, welcome
  to new York, man.

00:23:35,949 --> 00:23:37,687
It's good
  to see you, Buddy.

00:23:37,687 --> 00:23:39,524
How you doing?
  I'm great, man.

00:23:39,524 --> 00:23:41,995
Before "Shark Tank,"
  Sales were at $7,000.

00:23:41,995 --> 00:23:45,703
Post "Shark Tank,"
  we're nearing $250,000.

00:23:45,703 --> 00:23:48,475
So one of the reasons
  I brought you out here today

00:23:48,475 --> 00:23:50,446
was to talk about licensing
  and introduce you

00:23:50,446 --> 00:23:51,815
to Scott
  at The Wish Factory.

00:23:51,815 --> 00:23:54,152
Licensing is an amazing
  opportunity for soundbender.

00:23:54,152 --> 00:23:55,522
You get a large company

00:23:55,522 --> 00:23:57,727
to basically
  do all the work for you,

00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,797
manufacture it,
  bill it, ship it,

00:23:59,797 --> 00:24:01,568
and every quarter,
  you get a check.

00:24:03,305 --> 00:24:06,478
So, Moshe, I wanted to introduce
  you to The Wish Factory team.

00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:10,786
So, in anticipation
  of your coming here today,

00:24:10,786 --> 00:24:12,255
we've done a little bit
  of ground work.

00:24:12,255 --> 00:24:15,429
We're going to take
  Marvel's "Avengers"

00:24:15,429 --> 00:24:17,265
And marry that
  to soundbender.

00:24:17,265 --> 00:24:18,935
Wish Factory's
  gonna guarantee to sell

00:24:18,935 --> 00:24:23,310
$2 million
  worth of soundbenders a year.

00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,983
That's the minimum guarantee.

00:24:25,983 --> 00:24:27,853
You are my superheroes.

00:24:27,853 --> 00:24:29,423
We're thrilled
  that you're thrilled.

00:24:29,423 --> 00:24:32,028
Weiss: Having a partner
  and mentor like Daymond John

00:24:32,028 --> 00:24:33,397
is a dream come True

00:24:33,397 --> 00:24:35,803
because he's all about you

00:24:35,803 --> 00:24:38,240
and building the brand
  within you.

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,777
All right.
  Awesome, man! Whoo!

00:24:39,777 --> 00:24:41,146
Done deal.
  [ laughs ]

00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,500
Narrator:
  Next up is an innovative way
  to communicate with babies

00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,870
before they're even born.

00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,757
Hello.
  My name is Curtis.

00:25:03,757 --> 00:25:04,759
And I'm Matt.

00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:06,965
And we're the founders
  of Bellybuds.

00:25:06,965 --> 00:25:09,736
Today, we're seeking
  an investment of $500,000

00:25:09,736 --> 00:25:12,141
in exchange for 12 1/2%
  of our company.

00:25:12,141 --> 00:25:13,677
[ scoffs ]

00:25:13,677 --> 00:25:16,083
and this is our lovely friend,
  Danielle,

00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:18,454
who happens to be
  6 months pregnant.

00:25:18,454 --> 00:25:19,823
Now, we've all heard
  that playing music

00:25:19,823 --> 00:25:21,727
to a baby in the womb
  can be beneficial,

00:25:21,727 --> 00:25:23,330
but there's never been
  a product

00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:27,839
designed specifically
  for that task, until now.

00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:29,342
Bellybuds.
  [ laughter ]

00:25:29,342 --> 00:25:32,282
Bellybuds is
  a baby Bump sound-System

00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:35,621
that gently
  and discreetly adheres
  to a pregnant woman's belly

00:25:35,621 --> 00:25:38,127
and allows her to play music
  and voices to the baby

00:25:38,127 --> 00:25:40,498
in the womb anytime,
  anywhere.

00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:42,569
Thank you, Danielle.

00:25:42,569 --> 00:25:45,808
Wow.
  So, when my wife was pregnant
  with our oldest daughter,

00:25:45,808 --> 00:25:48,881
she used what she had, which was
  her regular, tiny earbuds,

00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,751
and pressed them
  to her stomach.

00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:53,724
But those are made
  for your ears, not your belly.

00:25:53,724 --> 00:25:58,534
So, that's where the idea
  of Bellybuds was conceived.

00:25:58,534 --> 00:25:59,836
Curt came up, approached me,
  and asked

00:25:59,836 --> 00:26:02,508
if I would like to be
  a partner with him on this.

00:26:02,508 --> 00:26:06,315
I, of course, thought two guys
  selling a pregnancy product --

00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:07,385
How could I resist?

00:26:07,385 --> 00:26:09,021
[ laughter ]

00:26:09,021 --> 00:26:11,292
But then I read the studies
  that are out there,

00:26:11,292 --> 00:26:13,497
and not only do babies
  hear inside the womb,

00:26:13,497 --> 00:26:15,968
but they actually learn
  and form memories, as well.

00:26:15,968 --> 00:26:18,006
For example, if you play
  certain songs with Bellybuds

00:26:18,006 --> 00:26:20,578
while you're pregnant,
  you can play those same songs

00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,147
after the baby is born
  to help soothe them.

00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:24,519
So it suction-cups
  to her stomach.

00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:27,124
Is it like
  a traditional earbud, or --

00:26:27,124 --> 00:26:29,161
WILLIAMS: It's -- Yeah, it's
  actually not a suction cup.

00:26:29,161 --> 00:26:32,034
It's a medical-grade,
  hydro-gel adhesive.

00:26:32,034 --> 00:26:35,340
Each pair lasts
  for about 20 uses,

00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,346
and then each package comes
  with replacement adhesives,

00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:40,050
and then we also sell
  those as a separate sku.

00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,687
Matt, can I see
  one of your packages there?

00:26:41,687 --> 00:26:43,924
O'Leary: You g-- You guys
  must have a lot of sales
  for this valuation.

00:26:43,924 --> 00:26:46,095
It's a $4 million company.

00:26:46,095 --> 00:26:47,999
Williams: Yes.
  Von waaden: Yes.

00:26:47,999 --> 00:26:50,470
Our sales in 2012
  were about $300,000.

00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:53,643
To date, the first half
  of this year,

00:26:53,643 --> 00:26:55,613
we're at about $340,000.

00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:57,017
We are approaching

00:26:57,017 --> 00:26:59,688
a $1.1 million
  gross product sales.

00:26:59,688 --> 00:27:01,492
And what's your profit
  on that?

00:27:01,492 --> 00:27:02,661
We're, uh, running
  a negative.

00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:06,102
Bad answer.
  Well, we're -- We're
  a growing company.

00:27:06,102 --> 00:27:08,372
And, you know, every dollar
  that we make,

00:27:08,372 --> 00:27:09,909
we're reinvesting
  into our company.

00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:11,078
How much did you lose

00:27:11,078 --> 00:27:12,581
in the first year
  and the second year, so far?

00:27:12,581 --> 00:27:14,651
First year,
  we lost $175,000.

00:27:14,651 --> 00:27:17,257
[ whistles ]
  2012,
  we lost $140,000.

00:27:17,257 --> 00:27:19,628
Why are you
  losing money?

00:27:19,628 --> 00:27:22,200
Well, we learned a very valuable
  lesson last year.

00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,970
I think you're about
  to learn another one.

00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:27,544
Yeah, well, we made a couple
  of unfortunate sales

00:27:27,544 --> 00:27:29,081
at the beginning
  of last year.

00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:30,650
We were --
  What is
  an unfortunate sale?

00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,487
Williams:
  It's selling to buyers

00:27:32,487 --> 00:27:35,193
who said they were going
  to distribute the product
  in a certain place,

00:27:35,193 --> 00:27:38,933
and it ended up being online,
  undercut the price,

00:27:38,933 --> 00:27:40,570
and it undercut
  our sales ourselves,

00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:42,072
and then
  all our retailers.

00:27:42,072 --> 00:27:43,976
Oh, so your retailers
  freaked out.
  Yeah.

00:27:43,976 --> 00:27:45,346
What did they do?

00:27:45,346 --> 00:27:47,651
Because that means that you had
  some upset retailers.

00:27:47,651 --> 00:27:49,721
Yeah, well, they
  were wondering about our
  control of the product,

00:27:49,721 --> 00:27:52,894
so we made the decision
  to stop selling

00:27:52,894 --> 00:27:56,802
in order to let all those units
  flush out of the market,

00:27:56,802 --> 00:27:59,474
'cause we wanted it to
  be over quickly rather
  than draw it out.

00:27:59,474 --> 00:28:00,810
The lesson we learned,
  obviously,

00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:02,380
was we need
  to know our customers better.

00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,852
So we contacted
  our existing customers,

00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:06,087
told them our plan.

00:28:06,087 --> 00:28:08,893
They were happy with us.
  They stayed with us.

00:28:08,893 --> 00:28:10,797
And since
  that has happened,

00:28:10,797 --> 00:28:13,235
we've seen our sales
  again go back up.

00:28:13,235 --> 00:28:14,538
That's fair enough.
  Good for you.
  Good recovery.

00:28:14,538 --> 00:28:16,542
Greiner: So, a good question is,
  what do they sell for?

00:28:16,542 --> 00:28:19,615
The retail price
  is $49.99.

00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:21,552
And what's your cost to make
  an individual package?

00:28:21,552 --> 00:28:22,787
Less than $10.

00:28:22,787 --> 00:28:24,223
Do you have
  a patent on it?

00:28:24,223 --> 00:28:25,660
We are patent pending
  right now,

00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,664
as well as we have
  several registered trademarks,

00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:28,699
and we own our --

00:28:28,699 --> 00:28:30,235
Well, the trademarks
  won't save you

00:28:30,235 --> 00:28:32,606
as far as
  somebody else making this.
  Fair enough,
  fair enough.

00:28:32,606 --> 00:28:34,410
What about competition?

00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,414
There are similar products
  on the market.

00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:38,118
We are, far and away,
  the coolest.

00:28:38,118 --> 00:28:40,589
All three of my kids, you know,
  going on ten years ago,

00:28:40,589 --> 00:28:42,761
we would do this,
  not that that's a --

00:28:42,761 --> 00:28:43,930
Herjavec: Did you use
  a different product?

00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,565
Yeah, we used
  a different product.

00:28:45,565 --> 00:28:47,469
There -- There are other things
  out on the market.

00:28:47,469 --> 00:28:50,542
You know, most of them are belts
  or straps or wraparound.

00:28:50,542 --> 00:28:52,413
If mark has already
  bought something

00:28:52,413 --> 00:28:54,918
that was not the exact same,
  but similar function...

00:28:54,918 --> 00:28:56,187
Functionally,
  functionally.

00:28:56,187 --> 00:28:59,895
...then why would you think
  you'd get a patent?

00:28:59,895 --> 00:29:01,932
Williams: Well, it's never been
  done with adhesive before,

00:29:01,932 --> 00:29:05,138
and what that allows is that
  you can move them anywhere.

00:29:05,138 --> 00:29:07,576
A lot of times, mom will know
  where the baby is.

00:29:07,576 --> 00:29:10,248
'cause every
  other thing is --
  So, how long
  has it been pending?

00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,419
Uh, three years.
  Three years.

00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:14,223
Conservative approach.
  So you probably
  aren't going to get a patent.

00:29:14,223 --> 00:29:16,294
Let's assume it
  conservatively that you're
  not gonna get a patent.

00:29:16,294 --> 00:29:18,732
Okay.
  You have a brand
  some people know.

00:29:18,732 --> 00:29:19,967
You've been selling some.

00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:21,904
You're hoping to sell
  a million this year.

00:29:21,904 --> 00:29:25,345
You come in here
  asking for $500,000.

00:29:25,345 --> 00:29:26,814
I don't know
  what this company's worth today.

00:29:26,814 --> 00:29:29,186
It's never made any money.

00:29:29,186 --> 00:29:31,290
In my book, that kind of matters
  a little bit.

00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:32,626
How did you get
  to the $4 million?

00:29:32,626 --> 00:29:34,196
The first thing
  that we have is,

00:29:34,196 --> 00:29:37,068
you know, roughly
  $110,000 in cash.

00:29:37,068 --> 00:29:39,005
Okay, so I deduct that
  from the $4 million.

00:29:39,005 --> 00:29:42,145
I'm still
  asking myself, "Whoa."
  I understand that.

00:29:42,145 --> 00:29:44,550
"How is this company
  worth $3.9 million?"

00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:47,823
we have $1.3 million
  sitting in our warehouse today

00:29:47,823 --> 00:29:48,825
ready to be sold.

00:29:48,825 --> 00:29:50,127
Inventory.
  Inventory.

00:29:50,127 --> 00:29:52,165
So you made inventory
  before sales?

00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,437
Yes.

00:29:54,437 --> 00:29:56,206
We have high hopes
  for the growth.
  Today --

00:29:56,206 --> 00:29:57,443
We're at the --
  GREINER: See, that's back
  to what I was saying.

00:29:57,443 --> 00:29:58,778
We're at the beg--
  When I hear,
  "We have high hopes,

00:29:58,778 --> 00:30:00,715
but we invested in all of this
  inventory up front"...

00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,118
no, no, no, but we --

00:30:02,118 --> 00:30:04,055
...it doesn't sound
  good to me,

00:30:04,055 --> 00:30:05,859
so for that reason,
  I'm out.

00:30:05,859 --> 00:30:07,261
Thanks, Lori.
  Thank you, Lori.

00:30:07,261 --> 00:30:11,069
I think your price
  of $500,000 for any percentage

00:30:11,069 --> 00:30:13,808
is outrageous
  based on the sales.

00:30:13,808 --> 00:30:16,146
I'm out
  truly for the numbers.

00:30:18,685 --> 00:30:21,991
I think your whole company's
  worth 500k right now,

00:30:21,991 --> 00:30:23,360
the whole thing.

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,197
I'm very simple to understand.
  I like to make money.

00:30:25,197 --> 00:30:26,934
There's no way
  to make money with you guys.

00:30:26,934 --> 00:30:28,170
I'm out.

00:30:29,773 --> 00:30:31,677
I love the packaging.
  I love the design.

00:30:31,677 --> 00:30:33,614
I love the story

00:30:33,614 --> 00:30:35,084
until mark said,

00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:37,255
"Yeah, I've been using this
  for the last nine years

00:30:37,255 --> 00:30:38,257
with each
  of my children."

00:30:38,257 --> 00:30:39,927
I don't think
  you did enough

00:30:39,927 --> 00:30:42,031
to differentiate
  between your product

00:30:42,031 --> 00:30:43,600
and all the other products
  that are out there.

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,571
We've been
  the number-One brand online

00:30:45,571 --> 00:30:46,773
for about two years now.

00:30:46,773 --> 00:30:49,412
And So,
  as a number-One brand,

00:30:49,412 --> 00:30:52,920
it's equal to trailing revenue
  of $400,000.

00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,155
It's a gro--
  It's an expanding market.

00:30:54,155 --> 00:30:56,293
I don't want to waste
  your time. I'm out.

00:30:56,293 --> 00:30:57,261
Thank you.

00:30:57,261 --> 00:30:58,497
Okay.
  Thank you for your time.

00:30:58,497 --> 00:31:02,338
Okay, guys. I'm just gonna be
  brutally honest.

00:31:02,338 --> 00:31:03,407
Williams: Okay.

00:31:03,407 --> 00:31:05,878
Any type of
  consumer-electronics product,

00:31:05,878 --> 00:31:07,615
and particularly
  when you make it in China,

00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:10,421
you're gonna get
  knocked off like that.

00:31:10,421 --> 00:31:12,592
Particularly,
  you don't have a patent.

00:31:12,592 --> 00:31:14,229
They're gonna say,

00:31:14,229 --> 00:31:17,067
"These guys are selling them
  for $35 or $25 at wholesale.

00:31:17,067 --> 00:31:18,370
We'll sell them
  for $10."

00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:20,774
I think you've got
  a business here,

00:31:20,774 --> 00:31:22,077
but I think you're
  gonna get knocked off

00:31:22,077 --> 00:31:24,114
all the way
  to Hong Kong.

00:31:24,114 --> 00:31:26,253
I'm out.

00:31:26,253 --> 00:31:28,423
The good news is,
  when that child's born,

00:31:28,423 --> 00:31:29,692
it's going to be
  an accountant.

00:31:29,692 --> 00:31:32,465
[ Laughter ]

00:31:32,465 --> 00:31:34,736
Thank you
  for your time.
  Thanks a lot, guys.

00:31:34,736 --> 00:31:37,007
I think what happened
  in there was

00:31:37,007 --> 00:31:38,644
they really liked
  the product,

00:31:38,644 --> 00:31:40,914
and we just had a problem
  with the valuation.

00:31:40,914 --> 00:31:43,119
But we know what's happening.
  We know the industry.

00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:44,455
We know
  where this is going.

00:31:44,455 --> 00:31:46,292
So, it's disappointing,
  you know.

00:31:46,292 --> 00:31:47,995
We wish they had shared
  our vision.

00:31:55,009 --> 00:31:57,581
Narrator: Next into the tank
  is an entrepreneur

00:31:57,581 --> 00:31:59,051
from Camarillo, California,

00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:01,155
with an innovative
  new cosmetic line.

00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:10,273
Hi, my name's Abe Geary,

00:32:10,273 --> 00:32:12,377
and I'm seeking $200,000

00:32:12,377 --> 00:32:15,751
for a 20% equity stake
  in my company.

00:32:15,751 --> 00:32:20,093
Behold what could be the biggest
  spectacle in history.

00:32:20,093 --> 00:32:22,597
What I'm about to show you
  is incredible.

00:32:22,597 --> 00:32:24,601
Introducing...

00:32:24,601 --> 00:32:28,509
Petpaint.

00:32:28,509 --> 00:32:30,513
"Colored hair spray
  for your dog"?

00:32:30,513 --> 00:32:33,519
Release the hounds!

00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,791
Busting through
  your local tailgate party

00:32:35,791 --> 00:32:37,627
is London the Bulldog.

win, lose, or draw,

00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:41,668
you know
  who he's barking for.

00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:42,771
I like the colors.

00:32:42,771 --> 00:32:43,773
Check out Billie.

00:32:43,773 --> 00:32:45,443
She's rocking
  stars and flowers.

00:32:45,443 --> 00:32:49,651
And like every fashionista,
  she knows life is a catwalk.

00:32:49,651 --> 00:32:51,188
Aww!

00:32:51,188 --> 00:32:53,526
Petpaint is
  a veterinarian-Tested,

00:32:53,526 --> 00:32:57,867
super bright, washable,
  easy-to-use color spray.

00:32:57,867 --> 00:33:01,508
And with our full line
  of stencils, anyone can do it.

00:33:01,508 --> 00:33:02,844
Even you, Mr. Wonderful.

00:33:02,844 --> 00:33:04,614
I would love
  for you sharks

00:33:04,614 --> 00:33:06,685
to come swim
  in this dog-eat-dog world.

00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:09,691
Did you just
  wake up one morning saying,
  "I want to spray-paint dogs?"

00:33:09,691 --> 00:33:11,662
HERJAVEC:
  [ laughs ]

00:33:11,662 --> 00:33:12,897
A-Actually,
  these two are mine.

00:33:12,897 --> 00:33:14,401
This is Billie,
  and this is monkey.

00:33:14,401 --> 00:33:19,076
And, um, I tried to get
  a-a-a shirt to stay on my dog,

00:33:19,076 --> 00:33:20,646
and she tore it off
  immediately.

00:33:20,646 --> 00:33:22,951
I was like, "There's got to be
  something out there

00:33:22,951 --> 00:33:25,490
that -- That they don't know
  they're wearing."

00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:27,961
So a couple years of research,
  and we have Petpaint now.

00:33:27,961 --> 00:33:30,733
Cuban: So, you say you spent
  a couple years working on this.

00:33:30,733 --> 00:33:31,902
How much money
  have you invested?

00:33:31,902 --> 00:33:35,242
I've got about $240,000
  invested into this.

00:33:35,242 --> 00:33:36,645
Is that your --
  your own money?

00:33:36,645 --> 00:33:38,147
Yes.
  Corcoran:
  That's a lot of money.

00:33:38,147 --> 00:33:39,183
What did you spend it on?

00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,453
Well, it is,
  but the majority of it

00:33:40,453 --> 00:33:41,722
I still have
  in inventory, so --

00:33:41,722 --> 00:33:44,360
H-How much of that
  is inventory?

00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,433
I've got about $200,000
  in inventory.
  Wow.

00:33:47,433 --> 00:33:49,905
Greiner: So, I have a question
  for you I think is important.

00:33:49,905 --> 00:33:50,940
I'm not really sure

00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,877
that something like this
  is patentable.

00:33:52,877 --> 00:33:56,384
Geary: We have some patents
  pending on some key ingredients,

00:33:56,384 --> 00:33:58,822
but you can't own
  color on dogs.

00:33:58,822 --> 00:34:02,162
What happens if you
  take Winston Churchill over
  there, and you spray him red,

00:34:02,162 --> 00:34:05,235
and he runs around the house
  against the drapes?

00:34:05,235 --> 00:34:08,876
As long as you -- You let it
  dry, you're good.

00:34:08,876 --> 00:34:10,211
Okay, so how long
  does it take to dry?

00:34:10,211 --> 00:34:11,314
It's about
  20 to 30 seconds.

00:34:11,314 --> 00:34:12,349
Okay, that's not bad.

00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:14,086
What happens
  if a dog licks this paint?

00:34:14,086 --> 00:34:15,355
Greiner: Yeah.
  Any damage?

00:34:15,355 --> 00:34:16,925
We've tested it
  for toxicity,

00:34:16,925 --> 00:34:18,896
and we've tested it
  for skin irritants,

00:34:18,896 --> 00:34:21,902
and -- And both has -- has
  passed with flying colors.

00:34:21,902 --> 00:34:24,908
I don't know how often people
  are gonna wake up and say,

00:34:24,908 --> 00:34:26,979
"I want to spray-paint
  my dog blue,"

00:34:26,979 --> 00:34:30,051
other than a holiday
  or a festive party.

00:34:30,051 --> 00:34:32,789
How many times a year
  are you gonna turn

00:34:32,789 --> 00:34:34,226
a little rat dog like that
  into a zebra?

00:34:34,226 --> 00:34:35,729
Corcoran: It's fun.
  Why not?
  Herjavec:
  The zebra is cool.

00:34:35,729 --> 00:34:37,099
Do you have --
  do you have dogs?

00:34:37,099 --> 00:34:39,036
No, I have children.
  I don't need dogs.

00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:40,338
Okay, it -- it may be
  a bit foreign,

00:34:40,338 --> 00:34:42,175
but if you're super dad

00:34:42,175 --> 00:34:43,645
and you bring your family dog
  home with stars

00:34:43,645 --> 00:34:45,448
to your 8-year-old
  daughter's birthday,

00:34:45,448 --> 00:34:47,085
you're gonna be the hero.

00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,388
Yeah, it's very cool.
  Cuban:
  You're gonna be the hero.

00:34:48,388 --> 00:34:50,492
Corcoran: Abe, you're asking
  a hefty amount of money --

00:34:50,492 --> 00:34:52,329
$200,000
  for 20% of your business.

00:34:52,329 --> 00:34:54,600
Why don't you tell us
  How great your sales are?

00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,702
I bet they're amazing.

00:34:55,702 --> 00:34:57,706
Since it landed
  in my warehouse in March,

00:34:57,706 --> 00:34:59,710
we've sold $70,000
  worth of paint.

00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:02,783
And it sells
  for how much?
  It's $9.99.

00:35:02,783 --> 00:35:05,255
Okay.
  Now, here's
  the interesting part of that.

00:35:05,255 --> 00:35:08,026
So, we've got
  a 50-store deal with Petsmart.

00:35:08,026 --> 00:35:11,099
They want to retail it, but they
  also want it in their salon.

00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:12,602
Is this a potential deal?
  Is this an actual deal?
  Do you have any --

00:35:12,602 --> 00:35:14,707
We're shipping
  in about two weeks.

00:35:14,707 --> 00:35:15,842
And how much
  are you shipping?

00:35:15,842 --> 00:35:18,013
Yeah, we have
  about 12,000 moving.

00:35:18,013 --> 00:35:20,150
12,000 units,
  you said?

00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,520
12,000 --
  I think I totaled it up.

00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,989
It's about
  $12,000 worth.

00:35:22,989 --> 00:35:25,662
Oh, $12,000 worth.
  Initial order,
  50-Store test.

00:35:25,662 --> 00:35:27,833
Do you have the purchase order
  for the 50-Store test?

00:35:27,833 --> 00:35:29,235
It's in my inbox.

00:35:31,373 --> 00:35:34,178
What do you project
  the sales will be

00:35:34,178 --> 00:35:35,548
in the next 12 months?

00:35:35,548 --> 00:35:37,486
By close of business
  this year,

00:35:37,486 --> 00:35:40,057
I'm looking to do
  another $120,000 in sales.

00:35:40,057 --> 00:35:43,431
So, we should be
  right around $200,000.
  Based on what?

00:35:43,431 --> 00:35:45,468
My distributors
  and to the groomers --

00:35:45,468 --> 00:35:47,639
Grooming industry have reordered
  five times already.

00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:49,977
I think it's a great idea
  for groomers.

00:35:49,977 --> 00:35:51,514
I think it's
  very, very unique.

00:35:52,816 --> 00:35:56,389
You know what
  I think the product lacks?

00:35:56,389 --> 00:35:58,795
A good price.

00:35:58,795 --> 00:36:00,497
It's $10 for one can?

00:36:00,497 --> 00:36:02,669
I don't think
  that's an easy buy.

00:36:02,669 --> 00:36:04,305
So, I have to see this
  as a one-time play

00:36:04,305 --> 00:36:07,044
for halloween, maybe
  for a birthday here or there.

00:36:07,044 --> 00:36:08,848
And I don't really see it

00:36:08,848 --> 00:36:12,856
selling well
  at that price point, so I'm out.

00:36:12,856 --> 00:36:14,358
I'm sorry
  to hear that.

00:36:14,358 --> 00:36:16,964
So, Abe, I'm gonna tell you
  a story, okay?

00:36:16,964 --> 00:36:21,372
4,000 years ago, there was
  a people called the phoenicians.

00:36:21,372 --> 00:36:25,280
They found a way
  to take sea mollusks,

00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,184
crush their shells,
  and make purple dye.

00:36:27,184 --> 00:36:28,653
Because it was
  such a rare color,

00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:32,328
everybody wanted purple robes
  for royalty.

00:36:32,328 --> 00:36:35,400
These guys would dye the sails
  of their boats purple

00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,473
and sail into every war zone
  in the Mediterranean.

00:36:38,473 --> 00:36:40,844
Nobody touched them.
  You know why?

00:36:40,844 --> 00:36:43,083
Everybody wanted
  the purple robes.

00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:47,091
Everybody else got killed,
  but never the phoenicians.

00:36:47,091 --> 00:36:50,130
No one else knew how
  to crush the snails
  to make the purple Dye.

00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:51,466
Did you
  just make that up?
  No.

00:36:51,466 --> 00:36:52,801
Of course
  he made that up.
  That is a true story.

00:36:52,801 --> 00:36:54,572
[ laughs ]
  I never heard that before.
  And so --

00:36:54,572 --> 00:36:56,041
What's your point
  with that?
  This -- My point is this.

00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:59,348
If you had the purple dye
  no one else could make,

00:36:59,348 --> 00:37:02,321
you could sail off
  and make millions of dollars,

00:37:02,321 --> 00:37:03,523
but you don't.

00:37:03,523 --> 00:37:05,694
Everybody can make
  a colored spray for a dog.

00:37:05,694 --> 00:37:08,132
And for that reason,
  I'm out.

00:37:08,132 --> 00:37:11,272
You're not a phoenician, Abe.
  Sorry.

00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:14,512
What's -- What
  are you doing online?

00:37:14,512 --> 00:37:15,881
We're not doing much online.

00:37:15,881 --> 00:37:17,584
Why not?

00:37:17,584 --> 00:37:19,789
I just spent my attention
  with the larger people,

00:37:19,789 --> 00:37:21,392
with the industry leaders,
  with --

00:37:21,392 --> 00:37:22,561
But didn't it cross
  your mind

00:37:22,561 --> 00:37:24,197
that retail could be
  the worst possible side

00:37:24,197 --> 00:37:25,232
of the business
  for you?

00:37:25,232 --> 00:37:27,504
I just -- I just
  have not focused

00:37:27,504 --> 00:37:28,740
all my attention
  onto that.

00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,479
My first concern
  is when you said

00:37:31,479 --> 00:37:36,421
that you had bought up $200,000
  worth of inventory.

00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,460
You should never invest
  in inventory

00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:41,766
until you have sales,
  because you don't know

00:37:41,766 --> 00:37:44,939
how long you're going to sit
  with that inventory.

00:37:44,939 --> 00:37:47,310
The other thing is,
  they might do it once,

00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:49,180
but then they might
  grow old of it, you know,

00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,351
and maybe only do it
  a few times a year.

00:37:51,351 --> 00:37:54,257
So, I hope you do
  get those sales,

00:37:54,257 --> 00:37:56,228
but for me, I am out.

00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,238
Cuban: I agree with Lori
  in some respects.

00:38:01,238 --> 00:38:02,908
You took a big risk,

00:38:02,908 --> 00:38:04,110
but that also shows
  your commitment.

00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:07,818
But where I have
  a huge, huge problem

00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:11,993
is that you weren't able
  to see that online

00:38:11,993 --> 00:38:13,529
was your best solution.

00:38:13,529 --> 00:38:15,266
You use social media,
  and they post pictures

00:38:15,266 --> 00:38:17,570
of all the pets
  that they painted,

00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:18,807
and it's self-fulfilling,

00:38:18,807 --> 00:38:20,609
and you don't have
  all that risk.

00:38:20,609 --> 00:38:21,979
But you didn't see that.

00:38:21,979 --> 00:38:24,451
It's not that you can't do it.
  It's that you didn't see it.

00:38:24,451 --> 00:38:25,954
To me,
  that's so obvious,

00:38:25,954 --> 00:38:28,058
and then to me,
  that's a huge red flag.

00:38:28,058 --> 00:38:29,694
And for that reason,
  I'm out.

00:38:32,066 --> 00:38:34,671
The biggest challenge, and
  the greatest asset that we have

00:38:34,671 --> 00:38:37,777
is that it's a new and exciting
  product, okay,

00:38:37,777 --> 00:38:39,881
so that I can spend --
  all the more reason
  why the web

00:38:39,881 --> 00:38:42,186
would have worked
  great for you.
  It -- it would have,

00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:44,524
but people see it
  and go, "I don't know."

00:38:44,524 --> 00:38:45,626
are you kidding me?

00:38:45,626 --> 00:38:46,995
All they got to do
  is take a picture.

00:38:46,995 --> 00:38:48,832
Every kid
  with Instagram

00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:50,769
that's -- That's
  posting pictures of their dogs,

00:38:50,769 --> 00:38:52,707
and, you know,
  "Where'd you get it?
  Where'd you get it?"

00:38:52,707 --> 00:38:54,844
it's so easy
  and so obvious.

00:38:54,844 --> 00:38:56,715
That scares me
  that you couldn't see that.

00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:01,056
There's only
  one shark left.

00:39:01,056 --> 00:39:02,360
It's Robert.

00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:05,332
Robert,
  what are you gonna do?

00:39:05,332 --> 00:39:09,274
God, you know, I-I --
  usually, I'm so decisive.

00:39:11,177 --> 00:39:13,047
Uh...

00:39:20,261 --> 00:39:22,165
Narrator: Four sharks are out,

00:39:22,165 --> 00:39:25,639
and Robert is Abe's
  last chance to get a deal.

00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:30,381
God, you know, I-I --
  usually, I'm so decisive.

00:39:30,381 --> 00:39:32,385
Mark brings up
  a great point

00:39:32,385 --> 00:39:34,256
'cause my kids
  use social media all the time,

00:39:34,256 --> 00:39:36,227
and they see
  cute things like this,

00:39:36,227 --> 00:39:38,030
they're gonna
  search it out.

00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:40,468
They would have
  found you.

00:39:40,468 --> 00:39:43,407
I mean,
  I-I love the idea.

00:39:43,407 --> 00:39:46,648
But are you the guy
  to take that great idea

00:39:46,648 --> 00:39:49,621
with your current strategy
  and get it out to the market?

00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:51,190
I don't think you'll find
  anybody better.
  O'Leary: Are you saying --

00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:54,263
are you saying Abe
  is not a Phoenician?

00:39:54,263 --> 00:39:56,567
I -- You know,
  I haven't even talked

00:39:56,567 --> 00:39:58,972
about the million-dollar value
  you put on the business today.

00:39:58,972 --> 00:40:00,876
I'm just not
  seeing it today.

00:40:00,876 --> 00:40:02,880
What would it take?

00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,817
Hey, Abe, I'm gonna
  give you an offer.

00:40:04,817 --> 00:40:08,057
Barbara,
  I thought you were out.
  I changed my mind.

00:40:08,057 --> 00:40:11,597
$200,000, which you
  came in for,

00:40:11,597 --> 00:40:13,301
but I would have to take
  60% of your business.

00:40:13,301 --> 00:40:16,607
[ laughs ]
  Wait, don't laugh at it.
  Hold on.

00:40:16,607 --> 00:40:18,344
But I'd be doing you
  a great favor,

00:40:18,344 --> 00:40:21,583
because I would take over
  your social media space.

00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:24,389
I would have you
  up with a fabulous website,

00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:25,491
and you want
  to know something?

00:40:25,491 --> 00:40:26,593
You'd make
  a ton of money.

00:40:26,593 --> 00:40:29,766
But you are so stubborn

00:40:29,766 --> 00:40:32,706
that you'd have
  to really move out of my way

00:40:32,706 --> 00:40:35,078
and let me take over
  the sales of this...

00:40:35,078 --> 00:40:37,182
I --
  ...because you're
  hooked to --

00:40:37,182 --> 00:40:38,818
Mark's very most
  valid point --

00:40:38,818 --> 00:40:41,957
The most obvious play here
  is the website,

00:40:41,957 --> 00:40:43,761
and that's
  where your gold is.

00:40:43,761 --> 00:40:45,598
I-I don't disagree
  with Mark.

00:40:45,598 --> 00:40:48,036
Um, that --
  I agree with you 100%.

00:40:48,036 --> 00:40:50,308
Barb, what's your offer
  going to be?
  Now -- but that's
  an offer, okay?

00:40:50,308 --> 00:40:52,010
So, the -- What is your offer?
  $200,000 for 60% --

00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:53,914
$200,000 for 60%
  of the business,

00:40:53,914 --> 00:40:55,083
but think about this.

00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:56,620
You don't have to do
  any work.

00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,123
You just sit
  on the sidelines

00:40:58,123 --> 00:40:59,626
and enjoy
  counting your cash.

00:40:59,626 --> 00:41:02,799
60%, like --

00:41:02,799 --> 00:41:06,072
I don't want to tell you
  no right off the bat,
  but I need the value.

00:41:06,072 --> 00:41:08,577
You know what the other value
  is? Good judgment.

00:41:08,577 --> 00:41:09,613
Yeah.
  Okay?

00:41:09,613 --> 00:41:11,282
You don't have
  the judgment,

00:41:11,282 --> 00:41:14,088
I think, to make
  the right plays.

00:41:14,088 --> 00:41:15,992
You need a little help
  in that area.

00:41:15,992 --> 00:41:17,529
And that's a big part.
  Can we -- can We --

00:41:17,529 --> 00:41:18,731
can we step back
  a little bit?

00:41:21,235 --> 00:41:23,006
Herjavec: Abe, I'm gonna let you
  focus on Barbara.

00:41:23,006 --> 00:41:25,110
I'm trying to get there.
  I just can't get there.

00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,613
But let me --
  Let me --
  I'm out.

00:41:26,613 --> 00:41:29,553
O'Leary: Okay, now there's
  one shark still in.

00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:32,224
She offered you
  $200,000 for 60%.

00:41:32,224 --> 00:41:34,963
I don't think your whole
  company's worth $200,000,

00:41:34,963 --> 00:41:36,032
to be Frank with you,

00:41:36,032 --> 00:41:37,635
for reasons
  I've already discussed.

00:41:37,635 --> 00:41:39,673
But there's an offer.
  What are you gonna do?

00:41:48,757 --> 00:41:49,926
Are you gonna take her offer
  or Not?

00:41:49,926 --> 00:41:52,899
Look, I don't want
  to partner with somebody

00:41:52,899 --> 00:41:54,668
who's just looking
  to grab equity,

00:41:54,668 --> 00:41:56,907
'cause this is gonna be
  incredibly successful.

00:41:56,907 --> 00:41:58,209
I take that as a no.

00:41:58,209 --> 00:41:59,980
I'm gonna have to say no.

00:42:01,917 --> 00:42:04,722
I'll see you guys
  on the internet.

00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:06,259
Good luck.

00:42:06,259 --> 00:42:07,996
Thank you.

00:42:07,996 --> 00:42:09,933
[ whistles, smooches ]

00:42:09,933 --> 00:42:11,402
Oh, my.

00:42:11,402 --> 00:42:13,373
[ laughter ]

00:42:13,373 --> 00:42:14,604
Well, the dogs
  listen to him.

00:42:14,604 --> 00:42:17,140
The dogs
  are his best asset.

00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:19,042
I couldn't take the deal
  with Barbara.

00:42:19,042 --> 00:42:20,343
She wanted too much equity,

00:42:20,343 --> 00:42:22,512
but I am going to take
  her advice

00:42:22,512 --> 00:42:24,647
and all the rest
  of the sharks',

00:42:24,647 --> 00:42:26,249
and you will see
  Petpaint online.
