they're asking for...

However, one of the most
ubiquitous technologies,

00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:04,430
the doorbell, has not changed
since it was invented in 1880,

just to make our lives
more convenient.

Jamie,
what if you hit "Accept"?

then what happens?
If you hit "Accept,"
then the light goes blue,

I look at the three tiers
that it could hit --

00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,215
a luxury, mid-Tier,
and lower tier.

00:07:35,215 --> 00:07:37,954
And obviously,
we understand the luxury market,

00:07:37,954 --> 00:07:40,426
where we have the $20,000
and $30,000 systems

00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:41,895
and all that type of stuff.

00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:43,031
That's not for that.

00:07:43,031 --> 00:07:45,169
The mid-Tier
is the adts of the world

00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:47,173
that most likely
Will just add this

00:07:47,173 --> 00:07:49,044
to their services
in some sense.

00:07:51,082 --> 00:07:54,155
I-I'm wrestling over
where this goes in the market.

00:07:56,126 --> 00:07:59,232
I just don't think
it's for me. I'm out.

00:07:59,232 --> 00:08:02,640
Personally,
I'm a security guy,

00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,980
so the idea of having
another access point

00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,319
on my house like that
freaks me out a little bit

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,658
'cause all those --
Adt and all those other ones --

00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:11,793
are hardwired.

00:08:11,793 --> 00:08:14,232
I can't hack into those,
right?

00:08:14,232 --> 00:08:17,506
So I think you've priced
a lot of value into it,

00:08:17,506 --> 00:08:19,376
but I think my real struggle
with it is,

00:08:19,376 --> 00:08:21,280
it's really not
an internet play.

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,616
It's a consumer device.

00:08:22,616 --> 00:08:26,023
But you're pricing it
at $199.

00:08:26,023 --> 00:08:28,730
That -- that price point is
gonna start dropping quickly

00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,999
as your volumes go up.

00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:31,369
For that reason, I'm out.

00:08:31,369 --> 00:08:34,008
All right.
Well, sorry about that.

00:08:34,008 --> 00:08:35,812
Don't send him
to my house!
[ laughter ]

00:08:35,812 --> 00:08:37,616
It's just --
It's just you and you now.

00:08:37,616 --> 00:08:40,588
Jamie, let's take stock
of what's happened here.

00:08:40,588 --> 00:08:43,160
You made a few jokes
about Mr. Wonderful

00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,098
at the beginning
and about the royalty structure.

00:08:45,098 --> 00:08:47,103
Am I gonna regret that,
Mr. Wonderful?

00:08:59,362 --> 00:09:01,601
Narrator:
Four sharks are out.

00:09:01,601 --> 00:09:05,007
Kevin is Jamie's last chance
at a deal.

00:09:05,007 --> 00:09:08,816
Jamie, let's take stock
of what's happened here.

00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:10,286
You made a few jokes
about Mr. Wonderful

00:09:10,286 --> 00:09:12,023
at the beginning
and about the royalty structure.

00:09:12,023 --> 00:09:14,061
Am I gonna regret that,
Mr. Wonderful?

00:09:15,664 --> 00:09:18,938
The only person left
is Mr. Wonderful.

00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:22,646
I'll make you an offer.

00:09:24,283 --> 00:09:26,387
I'll give you $700,000.

00:09:26,387 --> 00:09:28,324
I want a 10% royalty.

00:09:28,324 --> 00:09:32,567
That drops down to 7%
after I recoup the $700,000,

00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:36,074
and I get 5% of the company's
equity today.

00:09:36,074 --> 00:09:39,215
You know, we -- we have a --
a vision, I think,

00:09:39,215 --> 00:09:41,487
to build a -- a big company
out of this,

00:09:41,487 --> 00:09:44,359
and I can't give 10% --
someone 10% of all of our sales

00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:45,662
'cause it'll bleed us of cash

00:09:45,662 --> 00:09:47,265
while we really need it
the most.

00:09:47,265 --> 00:09:49,637
I'm basically providing you
factoring capital.

00:09:49,637 --> 00:09:51,541
You need my $700,000
for inventory.

00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,646
But -- But, respectfully,
I can raise that money

00:09:53,646 --> 00:09:55,650
through venture debt or line
of credit or something else,

00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,354
so that's not the kind of
money that I'm looking for.

00:09:57,354 --> 00:09:59,859
Then why don't you --
Then why don't you counter me
with a venture-Debt offer?

00:09:59,859 --> 00:10:02,298
So, I would do $700,000

00:10:02,298 --> 00:10:07,309
for a 10% interest rate
with a 3% equity kicker.

00:10:07,309 --> 00:10:08,478
No, I'm not interested.

00:10:08,478 --> 00:10:10,649
That doesn't -- it --
It's not -- doesn't --

00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:13,589
It's not commensurate
with the risk I'm taking.

00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:14,858
Honestly,
I do appreciate the offer,

00:10:14,858 --> 00:10:16,161
but at the same time,

00:10:16,161 --> 00:10:18,432
that money that you would be
taking on the royalty

00:10:18,432 --> 00:10:20,203
I need to reinvest
back in this business.

00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,940
What's the difference between
the interest and the royalty?

00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,443
The interest is cheaper.

00:10:23,443 --> 00:10:25,314
Yeah.
The interest
I can get rid of.

00:10:25,314 --> 00:10:26,684
O'Leary: You can get --
I can pay you back.

00:10:26,684 --> 00:10:28,821
Oh, so you don't like the -- The
royalty-In-perpetuity aspect?

00:10:28,821 --> 00:10:30,592
Absolutely.
But I took the risk
up front.

00:10:30,592 --> 00:10:32,997
I believed in you -- the only
shark, I might add, that did.

00:10:32,997 --> 00:10:34,267
$700,000's a lot of money
up front.

00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:35,469
It is a lot of money.
Absolutely.

00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:38,342
That's --
That's a lot of money.

00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,515
Okay, Jamie.

00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:44,689
It's that moment
when I say you're dead to me

00:10:44,689 --> 00:10:46,727
because you don't want to take
my offer.

00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:48,731
I made you a very valid offer,
I think,

00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,967
under the circumstances.

00:10:53,108 --> 00:10:56,749
Respectfully, Mr. Wonderful,
we're gonna decline.

00:10:58,218 --> 00:10:59,955
Go kick some ass, Jamie.
Thank you very much.

00:10:59,955 --> 00:11:01,458
Good luck, Jamie.
Yeah, good luck.
Herjavec: Good luck.

00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,830
Siminoff: Thanks, sharks.

00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,966
Kevin, he was, uh --

00:11:04,966 --> 00:11:07,672
I'm surprised.
He was w-wavering.

00:11:07,672 --> 00:11:09,409
There was a moment where he
actually considered it.

00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:10,545
I would have done that deal.

00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,449
Whatever happened
to peeking through the window

00:11:12,449 --> 00:11:14,086
and saying, "Go away"?
[ laughs ]

00:11:14,086 --> 00:11:16,925
SIMINOFF: Mr. Wonderful
gave us an offer

00:11:16,925 --> 00:11:18,362
for just royalties
on the company,

00:11:18,362 --> 00:11:20,266
and I don't believe
you can build a big company

00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:24,275
having one person take 10%
of the sales for life.

00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:35,131
Welcome to Fire Island.
How do you like it here?

00:11:35,131 --> 00:11:36,368
[ cheers and applause ]

00:11:36,368 --> 00:11:37,570
Every year, I take

00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,875
my most successful
"Shark Tank" Entrepreneurs

00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,011
for a weekend retreat

00:11:41,011 --> 00:11:42,681
in my summer home
in Fire Island.

00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:44,752
This year, I've invited
Cousins maine lobster,

00:11:44,752 --> 00:11:47,759
villy's customs,
Tom+Chee, Ryan's barkery,

00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:50,698
Daisy cakes, the Coop,
and ride-on carry-on.

00:11:50,698 --> 00:11:52,635
It's my way of discussing
a little business,

00:11:52,635 --> 00:11:55,542
having a lot of fun,
and rewarding my entrepreneurs.

00:11:55,542 --> 00:11:57,513
I've got a gift
for everybody here

00:11:57,513 --> 00:11:59,751
that's gonna be
your bedtime reading tonight.

00:11:59,751 --> 00:12:01,688
It's the new "Shark Tank" Book.

00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:04,294
Every week,
millions of americans tune in

00:12:04,294 --> 00:12:06,065
to watch "Shark Tank,"

00:12:06,065 --> 00:12:09,104
and we never expected to inspire
so many hopeful entrepreneurs.

00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:11,109
So we decided
to write a book about it.

00:12:11,109 --> 00:12:14,082
All the sharks contributed
with their best ideas

00:12:14,082 --> 00:12:17,456
on how to build a business
and make your dream come true.

entrepreneurs for one reason --

00:12:21,865 --> 00:12:23,435
they're making me money.

00:12:23,435 --> 00:12:26,241
Our sales have increased
by $600,000.

A million dollars in Sales
and still climbing.

00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:32,054
We have done $2.5 million
in sales in one year.

Corcoran:
These seven small businesses

00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:37,265
Have created
over 150 new American jobs.

00:12:37,265 --> 00:12:39,336
It's just what we need
in this country,

00:12:39,336 --> 00:12:41,341
and I'm so proud
to be a part of that.

00:12:41,341 --> 00:12:44,313

in the whole universe.

I'm not here just to share
business expertise.

00:12:49,024 --> 00:12:51,596
I'm here to inspire them,
believe in them,

00:12:51,596 --> 00:12:53,300

It's been an awesome time

00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,580
to meet all
the other entrepreneurs

00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,849
and really get new advice

00:13:00,849 --> 00:13:02,719
about what we're doing right
and what we're doing wrong.

from each other,

a phenomenal couple days.

from Cramerton, North Carolina,

00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:27,139
with a unique alternative
to conventional condiments.

00:13:36,092 --> 00:13:38,797
Hello, sharks.

00:13:38,797 --> 00:13:42,105
My name is Julie Busha,
and my product is slawsa.

00:13:42,105 --> 00:13:45,044
I'm seeking
a $150,000 investment

00:13:45,044 --> 00:13:47,082
for 15% of my company.

00:13:47,082 --> 00:13:48,552
Tell me, when was the last time

00:13:48,552 --> 00:13:50,857
you were at a grilling
or tailgating event

00:13:50,857 --> 00:13:54,097
and someone actually
complimented the host or
hostess on their condiments?

00:13:54,097 --> 00:13:56,536
Well, it probably never happened
because -- Let's face it --

00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:59,275
traditional Condiments
are Boring,

00:13:59,275 --> 00:14:01,614
and they haven't changed
in decades.

00:14:01,614 --> 00:14:02,983
But what if I said I had

00:14:02,983 --> 00:14:05,622
the condiment
that will change your lives?

00:14:05,622 --> 00:14:06,825
Introducing slawsa,

a unique cross
between a slaw and a salsa.

00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:13,238
It's great
on your grilling fare,

00:14:13,238 --> 00:14:15,276
like your hot dogs,
brats, burgers.

00:14:15,276 --> 00:14:16,846
Use it as a sandwich spread

00:14:16,846 --> 00:14:19,552
or even as a dip
for tortilla chips.

00:14:19,552 --> 00:14:22,091
Right now I'd like for you
all to taste slawsa

00:14:22,091 --> 00:14:25,231
and how truly slaw-some
it is.

00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,503
[ laughs ] It's slaw-Some.
It's slaw-Some. Yeah.

00:14:27,503 --> 00:14:29,374
Now, we have four flavors.

For the garlic lovers
like Robert,

we have a garlic
and a garlic spicy.

We have the original
and the spicy as well.

decide what you want to put

00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,268
on your hot dogs
or your brats.

This is sauerkraut mixed
with mustard mixed with...

this is a cross between
a slaw -- So cabbage --

How did you get started
in the business?

00:15:25,795 --> 00:15:28,000
Um, it -- it is based
off of an old family recipe

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,808
of a former partner of mine
who I just recently bought out

00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:33,578
to be a part of it.
So, you bought into
an existing company.

00:15:33,578 --> 00:15:34,647
How much did you pay in?

00:15:34,647 --> 00:15:36,050
About $50,000 total.

00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,386
Tell me if I understand this
correctly.

00:15:37,386 --> 00:15:38,756
Yes.
So, there's relish.

00:15:38,756 --> 00:15:40,493
There's mustard relish.
There's sweet relish.

00:15:40,493 --> 00:15:42,631
There's some garlic relish.
There's hot relish.

00:15:42,631 --> 00:15:43,867
There's hot relish.
Right.

00:15:43,867 --> 00:15:45,638
But those have been
pretty much on the shelves...

00:15:45,638 --> 00:15:47,108
right.
...for the past 10, 15,
20 years, right?

00:15:47,108 --> 00:15:48,778
Right. Right.
What you've done is come in

00:15:48,778 --> 00:15:51,049
and say, "I'm extending
the flavor base."

00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:53,254
There is nothing like this
out there.
Well, exactly, right?

00:15:53,254 --> 00:15:54,991
Right, right.
You're -- You've -- You've
created a new category.

00:15:54,991 --> 00:15:56,193
John: Category.
This is a cabbage-based --

00:15:56,193 --> 00:15:57,764
Herjavec:
Julie, what does it cost

00:15:57,764 --> 00:15:58,966
compared to a standard
relish bottle?

00:15:58,966 --> 00:16:00,236
Um, well, it is gonna be
about 20% higher,

00:16:00,236 --> 00:16:01,471
and let me tell you why.

00:16:01,471 --> 00:16:04,579
Because a pickle relish
is basically vinegar.

00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:05,781
O'Leary: Right.

00:16:05,781 --> 00:16:07,284
And -- and it's a brine.

00:16:07,284 --> 00:16:08,386
Ours is a hot-fill process,

00:16:08,386 --> 00:16:09,590
so it is a little bit more
labor-Intensive.

00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:10,892
So, you have a co-packer
doing this for you?
Yes.

00:16:10,892 --> 00:16:12,529
Tell me what it costs you to
make it, what you sell it for.

00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:16,003
It -- all the flavors right now
is $1.25.

00:16:16,003 --> 00:16:18,308
Okay,
and you sell it for?

00:16:18,308 --> 00:16:19,377
$2.25.

00:16:19,377 --> 00:16:20,512
And can you tell me,

00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:22,517
based on the buyout
of your partner,

00:16:22,517 --> 00:16:24,087
if you're paying that person
a royalty at all?

00:16:24,087 --> 00:16:25,423
I am.

00:16:25,423 --> 00:16:27,962
Comes out to about .66%

00:16:27,962 --> 00:16:30,601
to any-- to up to
a little bit over 2%.

00:16:30,601 --> 00:16:32,840
Is there a limit to it?

00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,543
There is a limit.
It is not perpetuity.

00:16:34,543 --> 00:16:36,314
What are you gonna use
$150,000 for?

00:16:36,314 --> 00:16:38,785
Because of the buyout --
and that is my responsibility.

00:16:38,785 --> 00:16:40,857
I am not putting that
against the company.

00:16:40,857 --> 00:16:43,229
That's not on the books.
Right.
That is not on the books.

00:16:43,229 --> 00:16:45,400
It comes out of your profits,
or how do you --

00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,437
No, it comes out
of my personal savings.

00:16:47,437 --> 00:16:51,246
My husband and I have been
extremely...

00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:01,935
...fiscally responsible.

00:17:01,935 --> 00:17:06,445
We graduated college debt-free
because we earned scholarships.

00:17:06,445 --> 00:17:11,322
When it came time
to buy our first house...

00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,759
we bought a house

00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:16,100
half of what we were --
The lender approved us to buy.

00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,005
We've never paid a penny
of credit-Card interest

00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:22,179
in our lives because we don't
live beyond our means.

00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:23,950
If we had not saved up,

00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:28,091
I wouldn't have taken the leap
to become an entrepreneur.

00:17:28,091 --> 00:17:30,898
So that's my responsibility --

00:17:30,898 --> 00:17:33,737
Is -- Is -- is the buyout.

00:17:33,737 --> 00:17:36,911
I would like the money
for increased production

00:17:36,911 --> 00:17:38,715
because I know the $50,000
I have in there

00:17:38,715 --> 00:17:40,385
is only gonna last so long

00:17:40,385 --> 00:17:41,888
because we are expanding
rapidly.

00:17:41,888 --> 00:17:44,360
Are you currently
taking a salary?

00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,496
I am not.

00:17:45,496 --> 00:17:48,068
And I'm okay doing that
for a couple years,

00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:49,271
of not --
Not taking a salary.
For a couple years?

00:17:49,271 --> 00:17:50,473
You're gonna work --

00:17:50,473 --> 00:17:52,812
How are you living?
Yeah, how are you living?

00:17:52,812 --> 00:17:55,450
My husband and I saved
a -- a good amount of money.

00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,754
Good for you.

00:17:56,754 --> 00:17:57,923
Julie,
I love what you're doing,

00:17:57,923 --> 00:18:00,862
setting an example
for people around the country,

00:18:00,862 --> 00:18:03,134
around the world --
Give up a little bit,

00:18:03,134 --> 00:18:04,069
save your money...

00:18:04,069 --> 00:18:06,408
Yeah.
...and put yourself

00:18:06,408 --> 00:18:08,412
in an amazing position
to be successful.

00:18:08,412 --> 00:18:10,249
Yes.

00:18:10,249 --> 00:18:12,955
You're an example
like we rarely have in here.

00:18:12,955 --> 00:18:14,425
Thank you.

00:18:14,425 --> 00:18:16,495
I wish I could do more for you.
You know, I love it.

00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:17,632
I'll be a customer.

00:18:17,632 --> 00:18:20,873
I'll Slawsa-Cize a lot,
but it's not really --

00:18:20,873 --> 00:18:22,408
I'd like to get
in those stadiums, Mark.

00:18:22,408 --> 00:18:24,246
But that's not enough for me
to do an investment.

00:18:24,246 --> 00:18:25,582
I'm out.

00:18:25,582 --> 00:18:28,421
All right.
Julie, here --

00:18:28,421 --> 00:18:29,791
Here's what
I've learned about you

00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:30,994
in the short time
we've spent together.
Okay.

00:18:30,994 --> 00:18:31,996
You're
one tough cookie.

00:18:31,996 --> 00:18:33,733
Okay.
Right? I mean --

00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:35,571
That's a compliment.

00:18:35,571 --> 00:18:37,240
You know, you set yourself up
for success.

00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,481
But I find it
too sweet.
Okay.

00:18:40,481 --> 00:18:41,817
J-Just me,
personally...
right.

00:18:41,817 --> 00:18:43,153
...I like really,
really spicy mustard.

00:18:43,153 --> 00:18:44,990
And we can go
with the spicier flavor.

00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,195
I wish you all the best,
but I'm out.

00:18:47,195 --> 00:18:48,464
Okay.

00:18:50,703 --> 00:18:52,340
I would like to have a partner

00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,944
because I've never scaled
a business

00:18:53,944 --> 00:18:56,449
the way I need to scale this.

00:18:56,449 --> 00:18:58,386
I'm not gonna need
my hand held,

00:18:58,386 --> 00:19:01,727
and I'm haven't needed
my hand held for several years.

00:19:01,727 --> 00:19:04,066
Well, I tasted the product,
and my opinion

00:19:04,066 --> 00:19:06,905
in regards to the taste
of the product doesn't matter

00:19:06,905 --> 00:19:08,909
because your sales
proves me wrong.

00:19:08,909 --> 00:19:12,283
But if I'm not excited
about the product,

00:19:12,283 --> 00:19:14,020
it's really hard
for me to get behind it.

00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,055
Well, that's a shame.

00:19:15,055 --> 00:19:16,492
I'm out.

00:19:18,897 --> 00:19:20,868
You know,
I think you've done amazing.

00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:24,309
The fact that you got
into Kroger --

00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:27,683
1,500 stores --
is amazing.

00:19:27,683 --> 00:19:31,357
And the fact that you sold well
is amazing.
Incredible.

00:19:31,357 --> 00:19:35,032
But I, personally,

00:19:35,032 --> 00:19:39,675
don't want to be
in the Slawsa business.

00:19:39,675 --> 00:19:40,744
Okay.

00:19:40,744 --> 00:19:42,348
I think it's a great product,
though.

00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:43,918
I'm out.

00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:47,692
Kevin,
you like to make money.

00:19:47,692 --> 00:19:49,630
Yeah.
Cuban: Yeah.

00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,267
How -- How can we sell
over 200,000 jars

00:19:51,267 --> 00:19:54,808
with Very little marketing
in less than two years' time?

00:19:54,808 --> 00:19:56,411
Very admirable.
No question.

00:19:56,411 --> 00:20:01,088
I see your passion,
but 15% stake...

00:20:02,892 --> 00:20:04,996
...you're actually not
worth that right now.

00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:07,268
But rather than beat you up
on your valuation --

00:20:07,268 --> 00:20:09,339
Can I -- I would
like to tell you why I'm
worth a million dollars.

00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:10,809
Why?

00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,145
To go from $212,000
to $500,000,

00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:14,650
it would be
not very wise of me

00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,724
to not project
my next year's sales

00:20:17,724 --> 00:20:19,561
as closer to my valuation.

00:20:19,561 --> 00:20:21,398
But think about the risk
for an investor.

00:20:21,398 --> 00:20:23,369
Risk?
For that kind
of valuation,

00:20:23,369 --> 00:20:25,841
it doesn't reflect the risk
in a one-woman business.

00:20:25,841 --> 00:20:28,147
You could walk out
of the Shark Tank tonight

00:20:28,147 --> 00:20:29,582
and get run over by a bus,

00:20:29,582 --> 00:20:31,420
and that's the end
of this company.

00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,456
Well, that's why
you would have

00:20:32,456 --> 00:20:34,393
a-an insurance policy
on me.

00:20:34,393 --> 00:20:35,730
[ laughs ]
Yeah, but that -- That --

00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:36,832
then, if I do that,

00:20:36,832 --> 00:20:38,001
I'll want to run you over
with a bus.

00:20:38,001 --> 00:20:39,237
Right.
[ laughter ]

00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:40,606
It's a better return.
That's what I was thinking.

00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:41,943
I-I appreciate
the presentation,

00:20:41,943 --> 00:20:43,580
but it's not gonna happen
for me today.

00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,582
I'm out.

00:20:44,582 --> 00:20:46,586
Okay, well --

00:20:46,586 --> 00:20:47,655
Cuban:
Congratulations, Julie.

00:20:47,655 --> 00:20:49,192
You have
an amazing business.

00:20:49,192 --> 00:20:50,895
No, I-I appreciate
all of your time,

00:20:50,895 --> 00:20:54,804
and, um -- and I will make
all of you regret this,

00:20:54,804 --> 00:20:56,407
happily, So, thank you.
I hope you do.

00:20:56,407 --> 00:20:57,810
Keep on going.
Thank you so very much.

00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,080
All right.
Thank you.

00:21:01,618 --> 00:21:03,088
You know what?

00:21:03,088 --> 00:21:04,525
The fact that she scrimped,
had no debt...

00:21:04,525 --> 00:21:06,495
fantastic.
...pays off
all her credit cards,

00:21:06,495 --> 00:21:09,436
saved up enough money
to invest in this other
company and buy them out,

00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:12,308
is -- Is just such an amazing
example for everybody.

00:21:12,308 --> 00:21:15,414
[ voice breaking ] Greatness
does not come without sacrifice.

00:21:15,414 --> 00:21:18,121
I'm taking a risk,
and I've done that,

00:21:18,121 --> 00:21:20,693
and -- and it will happen.

00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:31,216
Narrator:
Next up are entrepreneurs

00:21:31,216 --> 00:21:34,055
from Detroit, Michigan,
with a way to enhance

00:21:34,055 --> 00:21:35,291
the sharing
of your favorite images.

00:21:43,542 --> 00:21:45,513
Hello, sharks.
My name is Trevor George.

00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,350
I'm Blake George.
And I'm Sanford Nelson.

00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,522
And our company is called
magic moments.

00:21:49,522 --> 00:21:51,159
We're looking to raise $500,000

00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:53,664
for a 15% equity stake
in our company.

00:21:55,435 --> 00:21:58,709
Millions of people take photos
on their cellphones every day.

00:21:58,709 --> 00:22:00,378
Magic moments allows you
to take those photos

00:22:00,378 --> 00:22:03,452
and create customized products
right from your mobile phone.

00:22:03,452 --> 00:22:05,422
The key difference
is that magic moments

00:22:05,422 --> 00:22:07,461
lets you create these products
on the go.

00:22:07,461 --> 00:22:09,999
No longer do you have to take
your portable camera

00:22:09,999 --> 00:22:12,605
and find that cord
and hook it up to your computer.

00:22:12,605 --> 00:22:14,542
No one wants to deal
with that hassle.

00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:15,811
Magic moments
solves that problem.

00:22:15,811 --> 00:22:17,482
But wait. There's more.

00:22:17,482 --> 00:22:18,718
For the first time ever,

00:22:18,718 --> 00:22:20,922
you can make money
off the products you create.

00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:23,728
Simply upload your magic moment
to our marketplace,

00:22:23,728 --> 00:22:25,600
share it, sell,
and make money.

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,771
So, how does it work?

00:22:27,771 --> 00:22:30,610
Well, sharks,
it's as easy as one, two, three.

00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,948
First, you take a photo,
like this.

00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:37,859
Then, simply upload your photo
to the magic moments app,

00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:40,398
choose a product, customize it
in our design center,

00:22:40,398 --> 00:22:42,169
and voila !

00:22:42,169 --> 00:22:45,709
Your magic moments
is ready for purchase.

00:22:45,709 --> 00:22:47,246
And it's not just t-shirts.

00:22:47,246 --> 00:22:50,554
We offer iphone cases, mugs,
mouse pads, coasters,

00:22:50,554 --> 00:22:53,560
canvas bags,
and hundreds of other products.

00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,896
There's a couple phone apps
that allow you

00:22:54,896 --> 00:22:56,633
to upload a picture
or make a t-shirt.

00:22:56,633 --> 00:22:58,337
More than a couple.
More than a couple.
Absolutely.

00:22:58,337 --> 00:23:01,443
But there are none that allow
you to sell the products.

00:23:01,443 --> 00:23:03,414
What do you mean,
sell them?
We are the first --
sell them.

00:23:03,414 --> 00:23:06,321
So, I take a picture
of the eiffel tower

00:23:06,321 --> 00:23:07,924
or a beautiful landscape
of detroit --

00:23:07,924 --> 00:23:09,360
because that's
where we're from --

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,663
or maybe the fall colors
that no one will ever forget.

00:23:10,663 --> 00:23:12,901
Do you have any evidence
 that you can get people

00:23:12,901 --> 00:23:14,471
to take uncopyrighted images

00:23:14,471 --> 00:23:16,208
and sell them to someone else
on your site?

00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:17,645
Absolutely.
Give me the numbers.

00:23:17,645 --> 00:23:19,482
There are no numbers,
necessarily.

00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:21,988
Oh! Don't you hate it
when that happens?

00:23:21,988 --> 00:23:24,360
Herjavec: So, Trevor,
your premise is,

00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,795
I take a picture of Lori,

00:23:25,795 --> 00:23:28,501
and not only do I want --
want it on my coffee cup --

00:23:28,501 --> 00:23:29,838
'Cause I love Lori --

00:23:29,838 --> 00:23:32,243
[ Laughs ] Thank you.
But I'm gonna put it
on your site,

00:23:32,243 --> 00:23:34,882
and everybody in the world
is gonna buy that coffee mug?

00:23:34,882 --> 00:23:37,086
That's until Lori sues
you into the stone age

00:23:37,086 --> 00:23:38,823
for using her image
for commerce.

00:23:40,193 --> 00:23:41,630
There is an entire community

00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,369
of -- of what -- What they call
iphonographers,

00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:46,106
or amateur photographers.
Yes.

00:23:46,106 --> 00:23:47,843
It's like everyone has become
a photographer these days.

00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,181
You should see the pictures.
It's absolutely beautiful.

00:23:50,181 --> 00:23:52,587
Do -- do you not think that
if I take pictures of you,

00:23:52,587 --> 00:23:54,424
your kids,
or something else like that --

00:23:54,424 --> 00:23:56,262
You don't think that
I'm gonna have a challenge

00:23:56,262 --> 00:23:57,764
out there in the market
if I sell it?

00:23:57,764 --> 00:23:59,501
Intellectual property.
- Copyright infringement

00:23:59,501 --> 00:24:00,705
laws-
 --I mean

00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:02,074
It's a serious issue
right?

00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:05,047
We've secured
an exclusive relationship

00:24:05,047 --> 00:24:07,085
with a public company --
cafepress.

00:24:07,085 --> 00:24:08,555
They're our back-end
manufacturers...

00:24:08,555 --> 00:24:11,361
there you go.
...which means we have
global distribution.

00:24:11,361 --> 00:24:13,131
Every image
that a user would take,

00:24:13,131 --> 00:24:15,002
whether it's to buy
or to sell,

00:24:15,002 --> 00:24:17,240
gets passed through
cafepress' legal team,

00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,542
and they approve and deny
each one

00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:20,079
based on a set of criteria.

00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:22,351
Who do you think, though,
is going to be utilizing

00:24:22,351 --> 00:24:24,589
the salable part
of this?

00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:26,761
Well, there -- there --
There's two sides of it.

00:24:26,761 --> 00:24:28,598
There's the personalized side --
The families, the weddings,

00:24:28,598 --> 00:24:31,604
the dogs,
things like that.
Herjavec: Okay, Trevor.
I don't get it.

00:24:31,604 --> 00:24:33,676
I take a picture of my dog.
Nobody knows it's my dog.

00:24:33,676 --> 00:24:35,913
Right.
I put it online.
Who's gonna buy that picture?

00:24:35,913 --> 00:24:37,617
No one's gonna buy that.

00:24:37,617 --> 00:24:39,789
[ laughter ]
No one's gonna buy
a picture of your dog

00:24:39,789 --> 00:24:41,859
because that's not
a great picture that
everyone wants to buy.

00:24:41,859 --> 00:24:43,096
So, what am I missing?

00:24:43,096 --> 00:24:46,269
That there's scenery
of -- of Los Angeles.

00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:47,772
There's --
There's a -- a beach.

00:24:47,772 --> 00:24:49,476
Why wouldn't they just go
to cafepress?

00:24:49,476 --> 00:24:51,046
Well, we are --
We are cafepress' mobile app.

00:24:51,046 --> 00:24:52,450
So, let's make that clear.

00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:53,919
So they can only deal with you
on mobile -- Nobody else?

00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,222
Nelson: Correct.
Blake:
Vendor-Specific, yeah.

00:24:55,222 --> 00:24:56,859
Mobile for -- for create and buy
and create and sell.

00:24:56,859 --> 00:24:58,462
We are cafepress' mobile app.
Cuban:
And what kind of deal

00:24:58,462 --> 00:25:01,000
did you have to do to get them
to go exclusively with you?

00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,805
We did a --
We did a licensing deal.

00:25:02,805 --> 00:25:04,542
It's
an exclusive relationship.

00:25:04,542 --> 00:25:06,480
We're their techno-- Technology
mobile arm.

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,615
What kind of sales
do you have?

00:25:07,615 --> 00:25:09,285
None.
Pre-revenue.

00:25:09,285 --> 00:25:10,655
Pre-revenue.
Sure. Sure.

00:25:10,655 --> 00:25:11,991
Herjavec: Ohh.
Goose egg.

00:25:11,991 --> 00:25:13,561
Did -- Did they take revenue
in your company...

00:25:13,561 --> 00:25:15,132
No.
...or is it a straight
royalty deal?

00:25:15,132 --> 00:25:17,002
It's a straight
royalty deal.
Blake: Yeah.

00:25:17,002 --> 00:25:19,140
Why would they do an exclusive
deal with you guys?

00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,245
When we went to make
the exclusive deal to them,

00:25:21,245 --> 00:25:22,480
we had the technology built.

00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,952
And all we had to do
was take our technology

00:25:24,952 --> 00:25:27,024
and map it into cafepress.

00:25:27,024 --> 00:25:28,928
Tell me what's unique
about the technology.

00:25:28,928 --> 00:25:31,767
Well, we're wrapped
right into cafepress,

00:25:31,767 --> 00:25:34,039
And you can create
and Buy everything
from the mobile phone.

00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:36,745
But anybody can do that.
Not everyone can do that.

00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:38,415
There's really only three
companies that can do that --

00:25:38,415 --> 00:25:39,717
There's cafepress, zazzle,
and shutterfly.

00:25:39,717 --> 00:25:41,121
John: Okay, guys.

00:25:41,121 --> 00:25:42,758
$500,000, 15%,

00:25:42,758 --> 00:25:45,564
you value your company
a little bit over $3 million.

00:25:45,564 --> 00:25:47,434
You have not made
any sales yet.

00:25:47,434 --> 00:25:48,771
Sure.
Okay.

00:25:48,771 --> 00:25:50,273
I'm gonna
smell this out here.

00:25:50,273 --> 00:25:54,216
That means you are
probably already in a
money-raise situation.

00:25:54,216 --> 00:25:56,186
Correct.
You've already
taken in funding.

00:25:56,186 --> 00:25:57,188
We're family and friends,
still.

00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:58,725
Family and friends.
How much?

00:25:58,725 --> 00:25:59,794
$500,000.

00:25:59,794 --> 00:26:00,830
$500,000.

00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,667
How much did they get
for that percentage?

00:26:02,667 --> 00:26:04,504
33%.
33%.

00:26:04,504 --> 00:26:05,975
You've already
raised this.

00:26:05,975 --> 00:26:07,510
Correct.

00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,515
One of the tests I do
as a -- as a tech investor is,

00:26:09,515 --> 00:26:11,152
I look at this and say
you've put a value

00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,588
of over $3 million
for me to enter

00:26:12,588 --> 00:26:14,927
to give you $500,000
for 15%.

00:26:14,927 --> 00:26:17,766
I can emulate
the same thing for --

00:26:17,766 --> 00:26:20,806
I don't know --
$300,000, $400,000.

00:26:20,806 --> 00:26:22,209
I'm -- I'm sorry.

00:26:22,209 --> 00:26:24,547
I don't buy your premise,
and I don't buy your valuation.

00:26:24,547 --> 00:26:25,583
I'm out.

00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,955
Fair enough.
Yep.

00:26:27,955 --> 00:26:30,092
I think you guys need
to consider

00:26:30,092 --> 00:26:31,496
the upside
of this massive market

00:26:31,496 --> 00:26:33,768
and think about the fact that
this little device right here

00:26:33,768 --> 00:26:36,340
that sits in the pocket of
hundreds of millions of people
around the world --

00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,010
This is the content-creation
device of the future.

00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:40,783
You're the first guy to ever say
that in "Shark Tank."

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,357
If I take a picture
of my cute puppy

00:26:44,357 --> 00:26:46,194
and my goal
is to make revenue,

00:26:46,194 --> 00:26:48,366
you don't think
I'm gonna take the time

00:26:48,366 --> 00:26:50,770
to just transfer that
over to my P.C.

00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,441
Or do something web-based,
because I --

00:26:52,441 --> 00:26:54,144
not if you could do it all
with -- right here.

00:26:54,144 --> 00:26:55,548
It's a whole lot easier

00:26:55,548 --> 00:26:58,020
to do it
on a web-based interface.

00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,824
I'm not doing it off my mobile
phone 'cause it's a hassle.

00:26:59,824 --> 00:27:01,961
Because you want to maximize
your revenue,

00:27:01,961 --> 00:27:05,402
you're -- You're not gonna care
if it's mobile.

00:27:07,139 --> 00:27:08,342
I'm out.

00:27:08,342 --> 00:27:11,348
Daymond, you're a branding guy,
right?

00:27:11,348 --> 00:27:13,319
We're talking about
magic moments here.

00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:15,324
I mean, we have a tradeMark
on the name.

00:27:15,324 --> 00:27:16,426
That's a massive name.

00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,796
In any language,

00:27:17,796 --> 00:27:20,034
someone would understand
the name magic moments.

00:27:20,034 --> 00:27:21,404
Magic moments --
That could be anything.

00:27:21,404 --> 00:27:25,646
That could be, uh, viagra,
a laxative -- Anything.

00:27:25,646 --> 00:27:27,149
[ laughter ]

00:27:27,149 --> 00:27:30,189
until you have proof of concept
in sales And you can show it,

00:27:30,189 --> 00:27:32,895
you're only making up
an opinion, and it's not a fact.

00:27:32,895 --> 00:27:34,198
I think you're
missing the boat

00:27:34,198 --> 00:27:36,369
because cafepress
is our proof of concept.

00:27:36,369 --> 00:27:37,639
Then I'm gonna have
to miss the Boat.
Okay.

00:27:37,639 --> 00:27:38,741
I'm sorry.
I'm out.

00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:40,178
Look, we know
that we have

00:27:40,178 --> 00:27:41,881
a robust system
that works, okay?

00:27:41,881 --> 00:27:45,088
And we're businessmen,
so if you guys like the concept,

00:27:45,088 --> 00:27:48,562
you know, make us an offer,
and we can negotiate.

00:27:48,562 --> 00:27:51,034
Why would somebody
want to buy the pictures
that other people take?

00:27:51,034 --> 00:27:52,036
Everybody can do it.

00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:54,943
I'm out.

00:27:54,943 --> 00:27:58,684
You know, I think what you've
really defined --

00:27:58,684 --> 00:28:01,223
If I understand it correctly --
That's unique

00:28:01,223 --> 00:28:02,726
is the immediacy.

00:28:02,726 --> 00:28:04,897
I don't think you've proven

00:28:04,897 --> 00:28:07,871
that the marketplace
actually exists,

00:28:07,871 --> 00:28:11,845
so that's my challenge
with the entire premise.

00:28:11,845 --> 00:28:13,449
I don't see the immediacy

00:28:13,449 --> 00:28:17,625
being the -- the real pearl
in this entire deal.

00:28:17,625 --> 00:28:18,693
I'm out.

00:28:18,693 --> 00:28:21,299
Okay.

00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:22,836
The immediacy --
When we launched,

00:28:22,836 --> 00:28:24,306
we were the first ones
out there.

00:28:24,306 --> 00:28:26,878
We're still the only app that
allows you to sell products.

00:28:26,878 --> 00:28:28,481
I mean, this is a --
this is a massive market.

00:28:28,481 --> 00:28:29,884
Cafepress --
$300 million business.

00:28:29,884 --> 00:28:31,721
Guys, that's great,
but Everybody's out.
You're done in here.

00:28:33,058 --> 00:28:34,060
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,931
Thanks, sharks.
Thank you.

00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:38,870
The sharks missed
their opportunity now,

00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:40,373
but that's okay

00:28:40,373 --> 00:28:42,311
because when they
want in, they're gonna
have to pay a lot more.

00:28:42,311 --> 00:28:43,847
I can't wait to give them
that valuation.

00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,218
Ooh!

00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,510
I'm Rosy.
This is my sister, Donna.

00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,147
We live in Washington, D.C.,

00:28:59,147 --> 00:29:01,653
and we are the creators
of surprise ride.

00:29:01,653 --> 00:29:04,259
We come from
a family of six.

00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:07,633
We escaped war from Lebanon
and emigrated to Canada.

00:29:07,633 --> 00:29:09,837
Donna: Growing up,
we really didn't have much,

00:29:09,837 --> 00:29:12,209
but our parents told us
that anything is possible.

00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:14,013
I wanted to go to school
at harvard,

00:29:14,013 --> 00:29:15,983
and I was able to go there
many years later.

00:29:15,983 --> 00:29:18,055
Rosy wanted to travel the world.
She got to study abroad.

00:29:18,055 --> 00:29:20,661
And even though
We didn't have much,

00:29:20,661 --> 00:29:22,698
we made the best
out of that situation.

00:29:22,698 --> 00:29:24,168
Safety first.

00:29:24,168 --> 00:29:26,840
Too often, we hear kids
complaining that they're bored,

00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,143
and moms struggle
to keep their kids

00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:30,783
with short attention spans
busy.

00:29:30,783 --> 00:29:33,789
Our product helps families spend
fun, quality time together,

00:29:33,789 --> 00:29:37,764
and it helps parents and kids
gain knowledge along the way.

00:29:37,764 --> 00:29:41,104
We've risked a lot
to make this dream come true.

00:29:41,104 --> 00:29:43,977
I gave up a great career
on wall street.

00:29:43,977 --> 00:29:46,248
We've both refused
great job offers

00:29:46,248 --> 00:29:48,187
to make this dream
come true.

00:29:48,187 --> 00:29:50,759
We validated that we have
a great product.

00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:52,763
People absolutely love
the experience,

00:29:52,763 --> 00:29:54,800
but we need capital
from the sharks

00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,671
to share the ride
with America.

00:30:14,309 --> 00:30:15,612
Hi, I'm Donna Khalife.

00:30:15,612 --> 00:30:17,015
I'm Rosy Khalife.

00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:19,788
Both: We're the sisters behind
the company surprise ride.

00:30:19,788 --> 00:30:23,663
Today we're raising
$110,000

00:30:23,663 --> 00:30:26,402
in exchange for 10%
of our company.

00:30:26,402 --> 00:30:28,173
Surprise ride
is a monthly bundle of adventure

00:30:28,173 --> 00:30:30,912
that gets kids excited
about learning.

00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:34,754
With surprise ride, every month,
kids receive a surprise box

00:30:34,754 --> 00:30:38,328
of interactive activities
and all the supplies they need

00:30:38,328 --> 00:30:39,864
to explore a new topic.

00:30:39,864 --> 00:30:41,869
We work with experts
to curate activities

00:30:41,869 --> 00:30:43,004
of the highest quality.

00:30:43,004 --> 00:30:45,310
Families everywhere
want to give their kids

00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,214
a good reason
to put away the video games

00:30:47,214 --> 00:30:49,251
and explore the world
through hands-on play.

00:30:49,251 --> 00:30:52,258
Surprise ride makes it easier
than ever before.

00:30:52,258 --> 00:30:54,830
Sharks, we actually picked up
some of your mail today,

00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,233
and your surprise rides
have arrived.

00:30:56,233 --> 00:30:59,006
Yes! Goodies!
I love the boxes.

00:30:59,006 --> 00:31:01,244
Thank you.
Beautiful packaging.

00:31:01,244 --> 00:31:04,351
Oh, wow!
Oh, Robert.
Will you stop?

00:31:04,351 --> 00:31:07,323
Look, Daymond.
It's car racing.

00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:10,597
You always act so amazed
by everything you see.

00:31:10,597 --> 00:31:14,305
Robert, you're gonna get
to design and model a racecar.

00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:15,708
Vroom!

00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,112
Lori,
we know that you love cooking,

00:31:17,112 --> 00:31:19,116
and who doesn't love
chocolate?
Right.

00:31:19,116 --> 00:31:20,920
You're gonna get to make
chocolate from Scratch

00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,425
and also design your very own
brand of chocolates.

00:31:23,425 --> 00:31:24,427
Great.

00:31:24,427 --> 00:31:26,264
Kevin, we know that you love
photography,

00:31:26,264 --> 00:31:27,734
so you're gonna get
a solar kit

00:31:27,734 --> 00:31:31,242
that has you taking pictures
using the power of the sun.

00:31:31,242 --> 00:31:33,112
Thank you.
Love it.

00:31:33,112 --> 00:31:34,683
Daymond, we heard
that you love to travel,

00:31:34,683 --> 00:31:36,520
so you are gonna be entering
an adventure

00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,059
into the exciting city
of Barcelona.

00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:40,328
All right.

00:31:40,328 --> 00:31:42,199
So, you're gonna be designing
a mosaic

00:31:42,199 --> 00:31:44,704
in the style of world-renowned
architect Gaudi

00:31:44,704 --> 00:31:46,642
and exploring the fashion
in barcelona.

00:31:46,642 --> 00:31:47,644
I like.

00:31:47,644 --> 00:31:49,046
And you heard
I like to get fat?

00:31:49,046 --> 00:31:50,918
Yeah!
[ Laughter ]

00:31:50,918 --> 00:31:52,755
We heard that you love --

00:31:52,755 --> 00:31:54,592
We -- we -- we --
we might have heard

00:31:54,592 --> 00:31:55,996
that you love basketball,

00:31:55,996 --> 00:31:57,966
so we designed
a basketball-themed ride

00:31:57,966 --> 00:31:59,435
that has you creating

00:31:59,435 --> 00:32:01,741
a mini basketball game
for your desk.

00:32:01,741 --> 00:32:03,077
And then get fat.

00:32:03,077 --> 00:32:05,883
What's a good game
without some popcorn?
I got that.

00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:07,954
This is really cute.

00:32:07,954 --> 00:32:10,827
I mean, I have to say, this is

00:32:10,827 --> 00:32:14,502
an extremely well-constructed
quality surprise box.

00:32:14,502 --> 00:32:16,239
Well, first of all,
thank you very much.

00:32:16,239 --> 00:32:19,311
Very, very cool.
How much do they sell for?

00:32:19,311 --> 00:32:20,415
It starts at $24.99

00:32:20,415 --> 00:32:22,686
for a 6-Month or a 12-Month
subscription.

00:32:22,686 --> 00:32:24,489
And that's per month. Right.
Per month. Yep.

00:32:24,489 --> 00:32:26,995
And it's $29.99 if you buy it
on a monthly basis.

00:32:26,995 --> 00:32:28,432
What are your sales?

00:32:28,432 --> 00:32:30,704
So, so far,
we've shipped almost 800 boxes,

00:32:30,704 --> 00:32:33,309
and we've got over 220
active members.

00:32:33,309 --> 00:32:35,714
That's just in the last
four months.

00:32:35,714 --> 00:32:37,150
Oh, okay.
Four months,
so you just started.
Oh.

00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,721
O'Leary: Ladies,
you know in an online business,

00:32:38,721 --> 00:32:40,023
when someone comes
into the Shark Tank

00:32:40,023 --> 00:32:41,093
with a model like this,

00:32:41,093 --> 00:32:42,996
the two questions
that always get asked,

00:32:42,996 --> 00:32:44,800
and hopefully,
you're gonna know this answer --

00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,473
What is your
customer-acquisition cost,

00:32:47,473 --> 00:32:50,045
and what is the value of that
customer in profit margin?

00:32:50,045 --> 00:32:53,352
So, our customer-acquisition
cost is $5.30.

00:32:53,352 --> 00:32:56,125
What's the value of that
customer for 12 months?

00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:58,263
So, for just a 12-Month period,
it's a $130 customer value.

00:32:58,263 --> 00:33:00,334
Usually,
when Mr. O'Leary

00:33:00,334 --> 00:33:02,271
asks the client-acquisition
question,

00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:06,080
there's a lot
of deer-in-the-headlight,

00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,917
but what a great answer.

00:33:07,917 --> 00:33:08,919
I got to know
your background.

00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:10,188
My background
is on Wall Street.

00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:11,758
I actually worked

00:33:11,758 --> 00:33:14,097
in mergers and acquisitions
for a number of years.

00:33:14,097 --> 00:33:16,769
Ahh.
Then I left that and went back
to get my MBA at Harvard,

00:33:16,769 --> 00:33:19,175
fell in love
with Social entrepreneurship.
You have a Harvard MBA?

00:33:19,175 --> 00:33:20,711
Good for you.
O'Leary:
What about your sister?

00:33:20,711 --> 00:33:21,980
I have a degree
in marketing,

00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,384
so I have
a business background.

00:33:23,384 --> 00:33:25,388
I've worked with a number
of lifestyle brands

00:33:25,388 --> 00:33:27,927
and even some kid brands,
so --

00:33:27,927 --> 00:33:30,566
What does it cost you
to make each box,

00:33:30,566 --> 00:33:32,770
and where are you
making these?

00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:34,140
We're at a 50% margin,

00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:37,112
and that 50% goes towards
buying our merchandise,

00:33:37,112 --> 00:33:38,683
shipping, and fulfillment.

00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,386
We have a fulfillment center
in Florida

00:33:40,386 --> 00:33:42,057
that assembles
all the boxes

00:33:42,057 --> 00:33:44,596
and ships them
out to our customers.

00:33:44,596 --> 00:33:46,633
Can they scale?
Absolutely.
Donna: They can.

00:33:46,633 --> 00:33:48,404
So -- So, my business-School
background basically forced us

00:33:48,404 --> 00:33:50,609
from day 1 to create a business
that's scalable.

00:33:50,609 --> 00:33:52,947
Greiner:
One of the concerns --

00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:55,218
and I say this often
to new entrepreneurs --

00:33:55,218 --> 00:33:57,657
is don't invest too much
before you have the sales.

00:33:57,657 --> 00:33:59,094
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
We actually --

00:33:59,094 --> 00:34:02,902
So, how much have you invested
in that is in that warehouse?

00:34:02,902 --> 00:34:04,572
This business model
really allows us

00:34:04,572 --> 00:34:06,209
to anticipate
the demand very close

00:34:06,209 --> 00:34:08,013
to when we need to order
that inventory,

00:34:08,013 --> 00:34:11,053
which is terrific, so we have
very little inventory.

00:34:11,053 --> 00:34:12,188
Because they're
multi-Month orders.
Right.

00:34:12,188 --> 00:34:13,257
We can actually estimate

00:34:13,257 --> 00:34:14,527
how many orders
we're having

00:34:14,527 --> 00:34:15,596
and --
And order accordingly.

00:34:15,596 --> 00:34:18,937
And, I'd like to add,
we've raised $100,000

00:34:18,937 --> 00:34:20,740
from a very well-known
tech investor --

00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,711
Irwin Jacobs, who's the founder
of Qualcomm.

00:34:22,711 --> 00:34:24,448
How much equity
did he get?

00:34:24,448 --> 00:34:25,551
He's actually
an -- An Angel investor

00:34:25,551 --> 00:34:27,822
in the form
of a convertible note.

00:34:27,822 --> 00:34:30,628
So, you know darn well
that $100,000 from Irwin

00:34:30,628 --> 00:34:34,570
and $110,000 from us ain't squat
for a subscription business.

00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:37,777
The -- the capital
that we're raising now

00:34:37,777 --> 00:34:39,046
gets us through
the next 12 months.

00:34:39,046 --> 00:34:40,416
Are you sure?

00:34:40,416 --> 00:34:41,719
Yes, and the rea--

00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:43,857
Because in
a subscription-based business --

00:34:43,857 --> 00:34:45,226
You know how many have
gone out of business.

00:34:45,226 --> 00:34:47,097
Yes. We're familiar
with that.
Right?

00:34:47,097 --> 00:34:49,035
And what's the projection
for next year, Donna?

00:34:49,035 --> 00:34:51,540
For next year, we're
anticipating about
$500,000 in sales,

00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,976
and that's
on the low end --

00:34:52,976 --> 00:34:54,045
How many subscribers
is that?

00:34:54,045 --> 00:34:55,548
That's 3,500.

00:34:55,548 --> 00:34:57,854
Look, you don't have
enough money to get
to $500,000 in sales.

00:34:57,854 --> 00:34:59,557
John: But they might
because they have access
to this other investor.

00:34:59,557 --> 00:35:01,963
So if you have this --

00:35:01,963 --> 00:35:03,298
I didn't get to answer
your question earlier,

00:35:03,298 --> 00:35:05,303
but Daymond, effectively,
is doing that, which is that --

00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:07,006
if you have this other investor,
why are you here?

00:35:07,006 --> 00:35:08,878
Irwin invested in us.

00:35:08,878 --> 00:35:10,681
He's a big fan
of this mission,

00:35:10,681 --> 00:35:13,754
which is to bring curiosity
to children all over the world.

00:35:13,754 --> 00:35:15,759
Cuban: There you just hit
the nail on the head.

00:35:15,759 --> 00:35:17,496
There's a difference
between a mission

00:35:17,496 --> 00:35:20,736
and having a fully thought-out,
fully funded business

00:35:20,736 --> 00:35:23,341
that is gonna accomplish
a specific goal.

00:35:23,341 --> 00:35:24,711
I -- so, let me tell you
a little bit

00:35:24,711 --> 00:35:26,282
about how we plan
to spend that money.

00:35:26,282 --> 00:35:28,887
That might give you
some comfort.

00:35:28,887 --> 00:35:31,025
Two things we're doing --
Driving traffic to the website

00:35:31,025 --> 00:35:32,963
and then monetizing
that traffic.

00:35:32,963 --> 00:35:34,666
Okay, that's easy to say.
Explain.

00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:37,138
So, the first thing is,
we've partnered with a
marketing agency,

00:35:37,138 --> 00:35:39,878
the leading expert
on reaching moms.

00:35:39,878 --> 00:35:41,748
What does that cost you
monthly?

00:35:41,748 --> 00:35:44,721
It's gonna cost us $40,000 total
for the next 12 months

00:35:44,721 --> 00:35:47,594
to reach 5 million
to 10 million moms.

00:35:47,594 --> 00:35:48,663
John: Donna and Rosy,

00:35:48,663 --> 00:35:49,699
I want to make sure

00:35:49,699 --> 00:35:51,068
I heard the facts correct.

00:35:51,068 --> 00:35:53,673
I think you said you did
800 boxes

00:35:53,673 --> 00:35:55,445
and you have 220 members.

00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:57,682
Would that come
to around $25,000?

00:35:57,682 --> 00:35:59,553
Yeah, about $23,000,
$25,000.

00:35:59,553 --> 00:36:00,756
Herjavec: It's a startup.
It's a brand-new startup.

00:36:00,756 --> 00:36:02,560
I got it, but the startup
question here is,

00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,332
you would like $110,000
for 10%.

00:36:05,332 --> 00:36:06,635
Yep.
Yes.

00:36:06,635 --> 00:36:08,806
So the value of the company
at $1.1 million?
Yeah.

00:36:08,806 --> 00:36:11,479
You're an investment banker,
or at least you were one.

00:36:11,479 --> 00:36:13,684
Do you think there's a little
extreme ask in terms of value?

00:36:13,684 --> 00:36:16,223
So, of course, the -- the --
the classic valuation question.

00:36:16,223 --> 00:36:18,527
This is literally
what I spent...
yes, it is
the classic question.

00:36:18,527 --> 00:36:20,866
...every -- Every minute --
Every minute of my hours on...
Cuban:
I love that answer.

00:36:20,866 --> 00:36:22,269
...in investment banking.
And now you have
to defend it.

00:36:22,269 --> 00:36:24,507
We know
there are two things

00:36:24,507 --> 00:36:26,444
that primarily go
into a valuation --

00:36:26,444 --> 00:36:28,749
the team and the future earning
potential of this company.

00:36:28,749 --> 00:36:31,522
This team has been working
together for over 20 years.

00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:32,825
We work so well together.

00:36:32,825 --> 00:36:34,729
When you say you've been
working together for 20 years,

00:36:34,729 --> 00:36:35,798
can you explain that?

00:36:35,798 --> 00:36:37,869
By that, I mean
we've been sisters.

00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:39,974
Herjavec: I don't know
if that's a good thing.
I have two daughters.

00:36:39,974 --> 00:36:41,142
They're ready
to kill each other...
Yeah.

00:36:41,142 --> 00:36:42,479
...if they spend too much time
with each other.

00:36:42,479 --> 00:36:43,681
We hear that a lot,
but we --

00:36:43,681 --> 00:36:45,820
we came from Lebanon, actually,
as war refugees,

00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,325
and we lived in a one-bedroom
apartment when We were kids.

00:36:48,325 --> 00:36:49,861
We didn't have a lot
of video games and Toys

00:36:49,861 --> 00:36:51,666
and things
to entertain ourselves,

00:36:51,666 --> 00:36:55,072
but fortunately, our dad always
encouraged us to experiment,

00:36:55,072 --> 00:36:57,177
try a lot
of different things.

00:36:57,177 --> 00:36:59,181
We sort of had a crafts
store and a -- a chemistry
lab in our living room.

00:36:59,181 --> 00:37:00,952
In our basement, Yeah.

00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:02,455
Um, I'm a really simple
and basic guy.

00:37:02,455 --> 00:37:05,161
When I started fubu,
I sold 800 shirts.

00:37:05,161 --> 00:37:06,564
You know what I was worth?

00:37:06,564 --> 00:37:07,833
I was worth 800 shirts.

00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:12,243
You're valuing the company
at $1.1 million.

00:37:12,243 --> 00:37:13,379
I'm out.

00:37:17,655 --> 00:37:19,191
See, I don't quite agree
with you.

00:37:19,191 --> 00:37:21,229
And we can debate this
till the cows come home.

00:37:21,229 --> 00:37:22,900
My guess is,
you're gonna need

00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,137
somewhere between $3 million
and $5 million

00:37:25,137 --> 00:37:28,445
to scale this to where you have
a sustainable business.

00:37:28,445 --> 00:37:30,717
I went to school with the girls
who founded birchbox,

00:37:30,717 --> 00:37:32,921
which is one
of the most successful
subscription services.

00:37:32,921 --> 00:37:35,259
Mm-hmm.
They've hit
300,000 subscribers.

00:37:35,259 --> 00:37:37,097
But, you know, you're at a proof
of concept right now,

00:37:37,097 --> 00:37:38,099
in my opinion.

00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:41,039
I'm tempted,
but I'm gonna pass.

00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:42,441
I'm out.

00:37:42,441 --> 00:37:44,145
Okay.

00:37:44,145 --> 00:37:45,949
Donna, let -- Let --
Let me tell you where I'm at.

00:37:45,949 --> 00:37:48,087
Yeah.
It's a great idea,

00:37:48,087 --> 00:37:50,493
but there's a lot
of executional risk here.

00:37:50,493 --> 00:37:53,799
You know,
your idea of spending $40,000

00:37:53,799 --> 00:37:56,706
to get that traffic
is a little unrealistic.

00:37:56,706 --> 00:38:00,915
I think you're underestimating
the hustle

00:38:00,915 --> 00:38:04,054
that this business is gonna take
to get off the ground.

00:38:06,193 --> 00:38:09,099
But I think
you'll figure it out.

00:38:10,903 --> 00:38:12,373
So here's my offer to you.

00:38:22,795 --> 00:38:26,303
Narrator: Two sharks are out,
but Robert has an offer.

00:38:26,303 --> 00:38:30,645
So, my offer is the offer
that I feel comfortable with

00:38:30,645 --> 00:38:33,652
that reflects the executional
risk in the business.

00:38:33,652 --> 00:38:38,529
I'll give you the $110,000
for 25%.

00:38:41,301 --> 00:38:44,308
Lori, Mark, any other?

00:38:44,308 --> 00:38:47,849
You were asked what were you
going to do with the $100,000.

00:38:47,849 --> 00:38:51,690
You said $40,000
to a marketing company.

00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:53,729
What was the rest?
What were you --

00:38:53,729 --> 00:38:55,432
Optimizing,
monetizing that traffic

00:38:55,432 --> 00:38:57,069
so that we can actually generate
the sales.

00:38:57,069 --> 00:38:59,040
I think that this is

00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,816
one of the finest and best-Made
gift boxes for kids

00:39:03,816 --> 00:39:05,587
that I've ever seen.

00:39:05,587 --> 00:39:06,823
I love it.

00:39:06,823 --> 00:39:10,097
I know what it's like
to be a woman in business.

00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:12,435
And I know that sometimes
it can be Harder,

00:39:12,435 --> 00:39:15,041
but I also know that you
can make anything happen

00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:16,477
if you put your mind to it.

00:39:16,477 --> 00:39:20,687
I had to start
from the ground up by myself,

00:39:20,687 --> 00:39:23,025
and I had to figure out
a lot of things,

00:39:23,025 --> 00:39:26,499
but it was the best learning
lessons I could have ever had.

00:39:26,499 --> 00:39:28,670
And when I look
at the two of you,

00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:32,713
you make me think of myself,

00:39:32,713 --> 00:39:34,783
and I think
that you can do this --

00:39:34,783 --> 00:39:37,690
She's telling you she's
out, in like 9,000 words,
7 paragraphs.

00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:38,993
And -- don't be rude.

00:39:38,993 --> 00:39:40,863
Donna: Lori,
you know how to reach women.

00:39:40,863 --> 00:39:43,937
You know how to reach moms.
You know how to reach aunts.

00:39:43,937 --> 00:39:45,674
Doing it on your own --

00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:47,478
That's how you're
really going to learn.

00:39:47,478 --> 00:39:49,515
So for that reason,
I'm out.

00:39:49,515 --> 00:39:51,252
Rosy: Lori, no.

00:39:51,252 --> 00:39:53,224
I'm giving you
my very best advice

00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,829
because that's what I think
is important here.
Lori, we need you.

00:39:55,829 --> 00:39:56,965
Herjavec:
Donna, she's out.

00:39:56,965 --> 00:39:58,435
To address
your theory question --

00:39:58,435 --> 00:39:59,837
You don't have to address
anything.
Okay, cool.

00:39:59,837 --> 00:40:00,639
I made you an offer.
Mark?

00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:02,076
Either say yes or no.

00:40:02,076 --> 00:40:03,746
Cuban: Let me --
Let me ask some questions.

00:40:03,746 --> 00:40:05,583
What's your core competency?

00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:06,919
Our core competency
is execution.

00:40:06,919 --> 00:40:09,124
That's what I was
gonna tell you, Robert.

00:40:09,124 --> 00:40:11,095
Wrong answer.
Wrong answer.
I'm in talk with experts,
professors --

00:40:11,095 --> 00:40:13,267
Worst possible answer.
Worst possible answer?

00:40:13,267 --> 00:40:14,502
Worst possible.
Come on.

00:40:14,502 --> 00:40:15,604
The fact that you need

00:40:15,604 --> 00:40:17,075
to go out and get
this marketing company,

00:40:17,075 --> 00:40:19,313
you need to go out and get
this optimization company,

00:40:19,313 --> 00:40:21,084
you need to go out
in these other companies,

00:40:21,084 --> 00:40:24,090
means you don't have
that road to success

00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:26,095
directly in your mind.

00:40:26,095 --> 00:40:27,430
When you're an entrepreneur,

00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:29,736
you've got to be able
to control your own destiny

00:40:29,736 --> 00:40:32,274
on a number of things.

00:40:32,274 --> 00:40:33,978
I asked you the question.
What's your core competency?

00:40:33,978 --> 00:40:36,383
I thought you were asking me
personally, so my --

00:40:36,383 --> 00:40:37,719
Oh, come on, now. Come on.
I-I-I'm serious.

00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:39,189
That's a Harvard answer.
That's not a real answer.

00:40:39,189 --> 00:40:40,291
Oh, come on.
Okay, that's fair,

00:40:40,291 --> 00:40:41,327
but let me
tell you something.

00:40:41,327 --> 00:40:42,597
I'm out.

00:40:44,534 --> 00:40:47,641
This was why my offer
was so high.

00:40:47,641 --> 00:40:49,945
You don't live
in the real world.

00:40:49,945 --> 00:40:51,783
You live in the world
of theory.

00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,721
Ladies,
this isn't kansas anymore.

00:40:53,721 --> 00:40:57,094
I made you a generous offer
for you and for me

00:40:57,094 --> 00:40:58,798
because I can help you.

00:40:58,798 --> 00:41:00,334
I disagree with her.

00:41:00,334 --> 00:41:01,471
You need guidance
along the way.

00:41:01,471 --> 00:41:03,875
Are you staying in?
Will you do 20%?

00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:04,945
I'm out.

00:41:04,945 --> 00:41:05,980
I'm out!

00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,684
O'Leary: Whoa!

00:41:07,684 --> 00:41:09,855
Whoa, Robert. Whoa.

00:41:09,855 --> 00:41:12,327
You gave me time
to change my mind.

00:41:12,327 --> 00:41:13,529
I --

00:41:13,529 --> 00:41:16,101
Cuban: Guys, you said
you're all about sales.

00:41:16,101 --> 00:41:18,140
You had a sale.
You didn't close the sale.

00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:23,284
Ladies,
I think we're all out.

00:41:23,284 --> 00:41:26,658
Robert, if you come back in,
we'll do it.

00:41:26,658 --> 00:41:29,197
25%. We'll do it right now.
O'Leary: Interesting.

00:41:29,197 --> 00:41:31,268
You know what, though?
I'm not gonna do it.
Immigrant to immigrant.

00:41:31,268 --> 00:41:32,972
No. You know what?
I -- I hear --
Oh! Boom goes the dynamite.

00:41:32,972 --> 00:41:34,842
When somebody
makes you an offer,

00:41:34,842 --> 00:41:38,516
a bird in the hand, right?

00:41:38,516 --> 00:41:40,989
I made you a fair offer.
But, Robert,
isn't it smart --

00:41:40,989 --> 00:41:42,559
if you know you're willing
to take it...

00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:43,962
isn't it smart to look at all
your options and then decide?

00:41:43,962 --> 00:41:45,498
...you should have
walked across, and we
could have done it.

00:41:45,498 --> 00:41:47,837
Not always. Not always.
That's what a smart
businessperson would do.

00:41:47,837 --> 00:41:50,209
O'Leary: Ladies...
we came in here to chat
with -- with all of you.
It's debatable.

00:41:50,209 --> 00:41:52,213
We wanted to give you all
a fair chance.
...you've actually come into
the Lore of "Shark Tank."

00:41:52,213 --> 00:41:54,318
You are going to become legend

00:41:54,318 --> 00:41:56,689
because you had a deal
and you didn't close it.

00:41:56,689 --> 00:41:59,629
You came into the Shark Tank,
poo-poo happened,

00:41:59,629 --> 00:42:01,065
and you got a surprise ride.

00:42:01,065 --> 00:42:04,941
[ laughs ]
You've got to turn around
and walk into the sunset.

00:42:04,941 --> 00:42:06,143
Greiner:
Good luck, you guys.
It's over.

00:42:06,143 --> 00:42:07,379
Thank you.
Thanks. Thanks, everyone.

00:42:07,379 --> 00:42:08,615
Herjavec: Good luck.
Thank you.

00:42:12,958 --> 00:42:14,895
Robert pulling away
at the end

00:42:14,895 --> 00:42:17,033
is almost a blessing
in disguise.

00:42:17,033 --> 00:42:19,672
It showed how serious
or not serious he was

00:42:19,672 --> 00:42:20,700
about our business.

00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,168
That's hilarious.

00:42:22,168 --> 00:42:23,503
They talked themselves
out of a deal.

00:42:23,503 --> 00:42:25,505
You know what? It happens.
It was their deal to lose.
