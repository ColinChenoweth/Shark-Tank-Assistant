GONNA MAKE IN THE FIRST YEAR,"

00:21:29,046 --> 00:21:30,984
SO, MICHAEL,
LET THE NUMBERS TALK.
LET THE NUMBERS TALK.

00:21:30,984 --> 00:21:33,156
SURE.
$250,000 FORECAST
FOR THIS YEAR --

00:21:33,156 --> 00:21:35,294
HOW MUCH MONEY
ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE?

00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,132
WELL, I WILL SAY THIS --
UH-OH.

00:21:37,132 --> 00:21:40,307
I -- NO, I'LL -- I DIDN'T GO
INTO THIS PARTICULAR BUSINESS

00:21:40,307 --> 00:21:43,247
BELIEVING THAT IN MY FIRST YEAR,
I'LL BE PROFITABLE.

00:21:43,247 --> 00:21:44,417
SO, YOU'RE
GONNA BREAK EVEN?

00:21:44,417 --> 00:21:46,054
I WILL BREAK EVEN.

00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:49,096
IN FACT, LAST MONTH,
WE DID 25% MORE IN REVENUE,

00:21:49,096 --> 00:21:50,265
AND WE DID BREAK EVEN.

00:21:50,265 --> 00:21:52,404
WHY WOULDN'T YOU
JUST KEEP IT FOR YOURSELF?

00:21:52,404 --> 00:21:54,208
WHY WOULD I NOT
FRANCHISE THE BUSINESS?

00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:55,946
YEAH.

00:21:55,946 --> 00:21:59,254
THERE'S MUCH MORE MONEY TO BE
MADE FRANCHISING THIS BUSINESS.

00:21:59,254 --> 00:22:00,357
NO.

00:22:00,357 --> 00:22:03,197
WE'LL DISAGREE ON THAT
BECAUSE WHEN YOU GOT IT,

00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:05,436
AND YOU'RE
AHEAD OF THE CURVE,

00:22:05,436 --> 00:22:08,276
GET TO THE POINT
WHERE IT IS SO PROFITABLE,

00:22:08,276 --> 00:22:10,181
THE FRANCHISEES
WILL PAY WHATEVER

00:22:10,181 --> 00:22:13,222
AS OPPOSED TO YOUR HAVING
TO CONVINCE THE FRANCHISEES.

00:22:13,222 --> 00:22:15,093
YOU'RE PUTTING THE CART
BEFORE THE HORSE,

00:22:15,093 --> 00:22:17,064
AND FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.

00:22:19,103 --> 00:22:20,173
OKAY.

00:22:23,213 --> 00:22:28,359
SO, I THINK THAT THE
HAMMER &amp; NAILS IS REALLY CLEVER,

00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:34,006
BUT I HAVE NO IDEA
IF GUYS WOULD GO TO THAT OR NOT.

00:22:34,006 --> 00:22:37,181
I DON'T THINK
THAT I COULD EVEN JUDGE

00:22:37,181 --> 00:22:40,088
WHETHER OR NOT THIS BUSINESS
WOULD MAKE ME MY MONEY BACK,

00:22:40,088 --> 00:22:42,060
SO FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.

00:22:46,003 --> 00:22:47,240
Herjavec:
I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA.
THANK YOU.

00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,443
I -- I MEAN,
I REALLY DO.

00:22:48,443 --> 00:22:51,183
I MEAN, I'M -- I'M SITTING HERE,
I'M THINKING,

00:22:51,183 --> 00:22:55,460
"WHY AREN'T THERE MORE OF THESE
SALONS OUT THERE FOR GUYS?"

00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,103
BUT I REALLY DIDN'T LIKE
YOUR ANSWER TO MARK

00:22:59,103 --> 00:23:01,108
BECAUSE
THE ONLY GOOD ANSWER

00:23:01,108 --> 00:23:02,978
TO THE QUESTION
THAT MARK ASKED YOU,

00:23:02,978 --> 00:23:04,315
WHICH IS "WHY DON'T YOU
JUST DO IT ON YOUR OWN?"

00:23:04,315 --> 00:23:06,353
IS, "I DON'T HAVE
THE CAPITAL.

00:23:06,353 --> 00:23:09,295
"I PUT EVERY PENNY TOGETHER
TO OPEN UP ONE STORE,

00:23:09,295 --> 00:23:11,098
"AND I'M PROVING A CONCEPT,

00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,402
AND THAT'S WHY
I HAVE TO FRANCHISE"...

00:23:12,402 --> 00:23:13,271
RIGHT.

00:23:13,271 --> 00:23:15,075
..."IF I WANT TO GROW."

00:23:15,075 --> 00:23:19,018
I APPRECIATE THE MANICURE,
BUT I'M OUT.

00:23:19,018 --> 00:23:20,455
OKAY.

00:23:20,455 --> 00:23:24,065
O'Leary: SO, MICHAEL, YOU'RE
ABOUT TWO AND A HALF YEARS

00:23:24,065 --> 00:23:27,172
FROM EVEN GETTING ANYBODY
TO SIGN FOR A FRANCHISE LICENSE.

00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:29,143
AT SOME POINT, YOU
HAVE TO TELL ME WHAT THE
STABILIZED NUMBERS ARE

00:23:29,143 --> 00:23:31,115
FOR A TWO-
TO THREE-YEAR PERIOD.

00:23:31,115 --> 00:23:33,354
NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU TRY
AND SELL THE VISION --

00:23:33,354 --> 00:23:35,025
AND YOU'RE VERY GOOD AT IT --

00:23:35,025 --> 00:23:37,998
IN THE END,
AS WE KNOW IN THE SHARK TANK,

00:23:37,998 --> 00:23:39,235
THE NUMBERS RULE.

00:23:39,235 --> 00:23:41,307
THEY ALWAYS
DICTATE THE TRUTH.

00:23:41,307 --> 00:23:43,212
YOUR BUSINESS
DOESN'T MAKE MONEY,

00:23:43,212 --> 00:23:46,018
AND I DO NOT BELIEVE.

00:23:46,018 --> 00:23:47,122
SO, I'M OUT.

00:23:47,122 --> 00:23:48,425
OKAY.

00:23:48,425 --> 00:23:50,463
THANKS FOR CONSIDERING.

00:23:54,473 --> 00:23:57,313
SO, I APPLAUD YOU
FOR WHAT YOU'RE ATTEMPTING TO DO

00:23:57,313 --> 00:24:00,053
IN REGARDS TO
BRINGING BACK STYLE

00:24:00,053 --> 00:24:02,025
AND TEACHING MEN
SOME MANNERS.

00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:03,362
I USED TO BE A MEMBER
OF A PLACE IN NEW YORK

00:24:03,362 --> 00:24:05,500
CALLED JOHN ALLAN --
A VERY SIMILAR PLACE.
YEAH.

00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,042
I LIKE THE CONCEPT.

00:24:09,042 --> 00:24:10,212
MY CHALLENGE IS THIS --

00:24:10,212 --> 00:24:11,515
I BELIEVE
IF YOU HAVE A CUSTOMER,

00:24:11,515 --> 00:24:13,286
YOU HAVE TO
UPSELL THE CUSTOMER,

00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:16,260
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE SELLING
AN EXPERIENCE LIKE THIS.

00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,466
YOU GO TO SOMEPLACE
LIKE A JOHN ALLAN,

00:24:18,466 --> 00:24:22,074
THEY HAVE FINE SUITS,
THEY HAVE A-A BAR.

00:24:22,074 --> 00:24:24,314
ALSO, THAT WOULD BE
HARDER TO DUPLICATE

00:24:24,314 --> 00:24:28,122
FOR A FRANCHISE OWNER
IF THEY TRY TO KNOCK YOU OFF.

00:24:29,326 --> 00:24:31,231
I DON'T SEE
ALL OF THAT HERE.

00:24:31,231 --> 00:24:32,400
I'M OUT.

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,503
OKAY.

00:24:33,503 --> 00:24:35,207
I APPRECIATE YOU GUYS
LISTENING AND CONSIDERING.

00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:36,444
Cuban: GOOD LUCK, MICHAEL.
Herjavec: YEAH, GOOD LUCK.

00:24:36,444 --> 00:24:38,181
YEAH, CONGRATS
ON YOUR SUCCESSES.
Greiner: GOOD LUCK.

00:24:38,181 --> 00:24:39,217
THANK YOU.
John: AND THANK YOU --

00:24:39,217 --> 00:24:41,189
THANK YOU FOR
WHAT YOU'VE DONE FOR HIP-HOP.

00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:43,160
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

00:24:45,165 --> 00:24:46,368
Herjavec: I THINK
YOU BROUGHT UP A GREAT POINT

00:24:46,368 --> 00:24:48,172
ABOUT BEING ABLE TO BE
KNOCKED OFF AS A FRANCHISE.

00:24:48,172 --> 00:24:50,177
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I WAS SURPRISED
KEVIN DIDN'T BRING IT UP.

00:24:50,177 --> 00:24:51,281
OH, YEAH.

00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,218
I MEAN, IT'S JUST CHAIRS
WITH SOME PEOPLE DOING NAILS.

00:24:53,218 --> 00:24:54,521
O'Leary: I DON'T THINK
IT'S GONNA BREAK EVEN EVER.

00:24:54,521 --> 00:24:56,359
THAT'S WHAT I THINK --
IT'S GOING TO ZERO.

00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:59,266
Elliot: I LOOK FORWARD TO
THE TIME WHEN ALL OF THE SHARKS,

00:24:59,266 --> 00:25:00,369
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:03,143
KICK THEMSELVES AND GO,
"OH, MY GOD. HE DID IT."

00:25:03,143 --> 00:25:07,186
THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN,
SO...WATCH.

00:25:13,101 --> 00:25:16,141
Narrator:
NEXT UP ARE RECENT COLLEGE GRADS

00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:20,051
WHO BELIEVE THEY HAVE
A BETTER WAY TO STAY RECHARGED.

00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,141
SHARKS,
MY NAME IS BILL SHUEY.

00:25:29,141 --> 00:25:30,444
I AM THE CO-FOUNDER
AND C.E.O. OF AMBER.

00:25:30,444 --> 00:25:32,148
AND MY NAME'S KYLE BYRD.

00:25:32,148 --> 00:25:34,454
I'M HEAD OF PRODUCTS
AND A CO-FOUNDER AT AMBER.

00:25:34,454 --> 00:25:36,325
SHARKS, TODAY WE ARE
RAISING $200,000

00:25:36,325 --> 00:25:39,299
IN EXCHANGE FOR 20% STAKE
WITHIN AMBER.

00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:42,073
SHARKS, HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE YOU BEEN AT AN AIRPORT

00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:44,111
AND HAD YOUR PHONE
TRAGICALLY DIE IN YOUR ARMS?

00:25:44,111 --> 00:25:45,381
YOU KNOW OUR PAIN
ALL TOO WELL.

00:25:45,381 --> 00:25:47,118
THE FACT IS
WE DIDN'T WANT TO WALK AROUND

00:25:47,118 --> 00:25:48,488
WITH CHARGERS
IN OUR POCKETS

00:25:48,488 --> 00:25:50,226
OR GIVE OUR PHONES
TO BARTENDERS

00:25:50,226 --> 00:25:51,496
TO CHARGE OUR PHONES
IN A PUBLIC SPACE.

00:25:51,496 --> 00:25:54,170
WE SAW A PROBLEM,
AND WE CAME UP WITH A SOLUTION.

00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:56,208
SHARKS, AMBER IS
A MOBILE-PHONE CHARGING STATION

00:25:56,208 --> 00:25:58,547
THAT IS COMPLETELY FREE
TO USE.

00:25:58,547 --> 00:26:01,120
WE SECURE YOUR DEVICE
IN ONE OF OUR SEVEN COMPARTMENTS

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,392
USING BIOMETRIC SCANNING,
NAMELY FINGERPRINT SCANNING.

00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:05,297
WE MADE IT
SUPER, SUPER SIMPLE.

00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:06,400
LET'S SHOW YOU
HOW IT WORKS.

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,407
SIMPLY WALK UP,
SCAN THEIR FINGERPRINT...

00:26:11,178 --> 00:26:12,548
...CHOOSE ONE OF
THE AVAILABLE COMPARTMENTS...

00:26:12,548 --> 00:26:14,487
AND WHENEVER THEY'RE DONE,

00:26:14,487 --> 00:26:16,290
THEY SIMPLY
RE-SCAN THEIR FINGER

00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:18,162
AND ONE OF THE DOORS
WILL UNLOCK.

00:26:18,162 --> 00:26:21,470
WE REALIZE THAT AMBER
WASN'T JUST A FREE, SECURE WAY

00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,442
FOR PEOPLE TO CHARGE
THEIR PHONES IN A PUBLIC SPACE

00:26:23,442 --> 00:26:25,280
BUT COULD ALSO DRIVE REVENUE
FOR VENUES

00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,483
BY KEEPING PEOPLE
AROUND LONGER

00:26:26,483 --> 00:26:29,089
AND HEIGHTENING
THE OVERALL CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE.

00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:31,328
WE WANT TO PUT AMBER
IN BARS, RESTAURANTS, GYMS,

00:26:31,328 --> 00:26:34,402
MOVIE THEATERS, ARENAS --
REALLY ANYWHERE.

00:26:34,402 --> 00:26:35,405
THE LIST GOES ON AND ON.

00:26:35,405 --> 00:26:37,510
SHARKS, BY SECURING
AN INVESTMENT TODAY,

00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:40,117
WE CAN MAKE OUR FIRST BIG PUSH
INTO SEEING AMBER

00:26:40,117 --> 00:26:41,353
IN VENUES
ACROSS THE NATION.

00:26:41,353 --> 00:26:43,324
NOW, WHO WANTS
TO SECURE A DEAL WITH AMBER?

00:26:43,324 --> 00:26:46,465
SO, IS THE PRODUCT
SHIPPING?

00:26:46,465 --> 00:26:48,370
SO, WE ARE PRE-REVENUE.

00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:50,475
I LOVE THAT WORD,
"PRE-REVENUE."
[ CHUCKLES ]

00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:52,414
WE JUST GRADUATED
A FEW WEEKS AGO FROM COLLEGE.

00:26:52,414 --> 00:26:53,483
WHERE'D YOU GO TO SCHOOL?

00:26:53,483 --> 00:26:54,586
JAMES MADISON UNIVERSITY
IN VIRGINIA.

00:26:54,586 --> 00:26:56,357
Herjavec: BILL,
WALK ME THROUGH THE PREMISE.

00:26:56,357 --> 00:26:57,560
YOU WALK INTO A BAR.
SURE.

00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,397
I'M A BAR OWNER.
YOU'RE A BAR OWNER.

00:26:59,397 --> 00:27:00,534
HOW MUCH ARE YOU GONNA
CHARGE ME?

00:27:00,534 --> 00:27:02,171
SO, WE WILL EITHER

00:27:02,171 --> 00:27:04,577
CHARGE YOU $2,000 OUTRIGHT
FOR THE UNIT,

00:27:04,577 --> 00:27:07,317
OR YOU CAN LEASE IT
EITHER ON A SIX-, NINE-MONTH --

00:27:07,317 --> 00:27:08,319
AND SO I BUY IT FOR $2,000,
THAT'S IT.
SURE.

00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:09,356
THERE'S NO MORE REVENUE
FOR YOU.

00:27:09,356 --> 00:27:11,327
OR -- OR YOU CAN GET IT
RIGHT ON YOUR WALL

00:27:11,327 --> 00:27:12,564
FOR $150 RIGHT THERE, AND
IT'S -- IT'S A MONTHLY $150.

00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:15,204
IT'S A CONVENIENCE
FOR THE BAR,

00:27:15,204 --> 00:27:16,406
BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING
THEY HAVE TO HAVE, SO --

00:27:16,406 --> 00:27:17,476
WELL, SO -- SO ACTUALLY,
RIGHT NOW,

00:27:17,476 --> 00:27:19,214
PEOPLE ARE CHARGING THEIR PHONES
IN BARS, RIGHT?

00:27:19,214 --> 00:27:20,249
THEY'RE GIVING THEM

00:27:20,249 --> 00:27:21,419
TO BARTENDERS,
TO WAITRESSES AND WAITERS.

00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:22,421
THAT'S A LIABILITY.

00:27:22,421 --> 00:27:24,126
IT'S LIKE, "HEY,
CAN I GET MY PHONE?"

00:27:24,126 --> 00:27:25,296
WELL, THAT WAITER OR WAITRESS
MAY HAVE LEFT,

00:27:25,296 --> 00:27:26,464
GOTTEN OFF WORK,
AND NOW THEY HAVE A LOST PHONE.

00:27:26,464 --> 00:27:28,569
John:
GUYS, YOU SAID A DOOR LOCKS.

00:27:28,569 --> 00:27:30,508
I DIDN'T SEE A DOOR LOCK.

00:27:30,508 --> 00:27:33,181
SO, THE LOCKS IN HERE
IS WHAT WE'RE USING FOR TESTING.

00:27:33,181 --> 00:27:35,554
WE'RE ACTUALLY CURRENTLY,
UM, SOURCING OUR LOCKS

00:27:35,554 --> 00:27:36,589
THROUGH MASTER LOCK.

00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:37,592
OKAY, SO THERE WILL BE
A DOOR ON THERE?

00:27:37,592 --> 00:27:39,163
YEAH, YEAH.
YES.

00:27:39,163 --> 00:27:40,633
BILL, HAVE YOU TESTED
THE FINGERPRINT SCANNER?

00:27:40,633 --> 00:27:42,237
WE HAVE. WE TEST IT ALL
ON THE BACK END.

00:27:42,237 --> 00:27:44,376
'CAUSE I'M IN
THE CYBER-SECURITY SPACE.
RIGHT.

00:27:44,376 --> 00:27:46,247
AND HERE'S WHAT I KNOW
ABOUT FINGERPRINT SCANNERS --

00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:47,517
THEY CAN BE VERY FINICKY...
VERY.

00:27:47,517 --> 00:27:50,190
...EXCEPT FOR
THE VERY, VERY HIGH-END ONES.

00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:53,264
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO YOU,
THE IDEA OF YOU WALKING UP ONCE,

00:27:53,264 --> 00:27:56,373
PUTTING YOUR FINGER IN THERE,
AND IT RECOGNIZING YOU,

00:27:56,373 --> 00:27:57,475
AND THE DOOR COMING DOWN
IS LUDICROUS.

00:27:57,475 --> 00:28:00,383
WE HAVE
A BIG SECURITY CENTER.

00:28:00,383 --> 00:28:02,588
THE FINGERPRINT SCANNER
THAT WE PAY

00:28:02,588 --> 00:28:05,128
FOR PEOPLE TO GET INTO
THAT CENTER

00:28:05,128 --> 00:28:06,564
WAS WELL, WELL OVER $50,000.

00:28:06,564 --> 00:28:09,171
Y-- THERE'S NO WAY,
FOR THAT PRICE POINT,

00:28:09,171 --> 00:28:10,373
YOU'RE GONNA BUY
A FINGERPRINT SCANNER

00:28:10,373 --> 00:28:11,510
THAT'S GONNA WORK
THAT QUICKLY.
RIGHT, SO...SO --

00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:13,314
HERE'S HOW IT'S GONNA WORK --
SOMEONE'S GONNA COME UP,

00:28:13,314 --> 00:28:15,185
THEY'RE GONNA GO ONCE,
THEY'RE GONNA GO TWICE,

00:28:15,185 --> 00:28:16,355
THEY'RE GONNA GO
THREE TIMES.

00:28:16,355 --> 00:28:17,625
AND THEN THEY'RE GONNA PULL IT
OFF THE WALL. [ CHUCKLES ]

AND ADDED OUR ULTRA-COMFORTABLE
PERFORMANCE FOOTBED.

TO CREATE A NATURAL CUP
AROUND YOUR HEEL

THAT MADE THOSE SOCKS FEEL
SO MUCH BETTER

00:33:33,508 --> 00:33:35,580
AND BROUGHT THEM DOWN
TO A $9 PRICE POINT,

IN OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR,

WE THINK WE'LL CLOSE NEXT YEAR
AT $2.7 MILLION

AT $4.9 MILLION.
