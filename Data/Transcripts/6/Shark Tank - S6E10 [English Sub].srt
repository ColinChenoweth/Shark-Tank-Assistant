ONE OF THEM IS
A DESIGN PATENT.

00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,333
YOU KNOW, WE DO BELIEVE
THIS WILL END UP IN RETAIL.

00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,302
WE HAVE TALKED
TO MANUFACTURERS' REPS

00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:44,137
WHO HAVE BEEN VERY EXCITED
ABOUT THE PRODUCT,

00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,006
AND THEY ARE STARTING
TO TALK TO, YOU KNOW,

00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,307
RETAILERS OUT THERE --
THE BIG BOXES.

00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:49,309
BUT THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE'D
LIKE YOUR HELP WITH, AS WELL.

00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:51,411
THIS SEEMS LIKE,
AT A $29.99 PRICE, YOU'D HAVE --

00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,213
John: THE LOWEST
THEY CAN GET THIS, THOUGH,

00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:54,948
IT LOOKS LIKE, IS $10,

00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:56,383
WHICH MEANS, AT RETAIL,
IT WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY $40.

00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:58,018
Woodman:
YEAH, EXACTLY.

00:06:58,018 --> 00:07:00,053
YOU'D HAVE TO MORTGAGE
YOUR HOUSE TO HIDE YOUR COOKIES.

00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,425
KITCHEN SAFE IS MAYBE
A LITTLE BIT LIMITED

00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,427
AS A COMPANY NAME,
BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA WANT

00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,096
TO GROW INTO NEW PRODUCTS
AND PERHAPS NEW VERTICALS

00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,464
WHERE THIS IS NOT EVEN
IN THE KITCHEN.

00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,400
I MEAN,
I WAS REALLY LUCKY.

00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,268
ORIGINALLY,
I JUST MEANT FOR GoPro

00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,304
TO BE
A SURF-CAMERA COMPANY,

00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:20,140
AND THANKFULLY, I DIDN'T
NAME THE COMPANY "SURF CAMERA."

00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:24,010
SO I DON'T THINK THAT PEOPLE ARE
GOING TO NATURALLY THINK

00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,379
TO PUT ANYTHING
OTHER THAN FOOD IN THIS.

00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,315
Greiner:
HE'S EXACTLY RIGHT...
MM-HMM.

00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,216
BUT THE BEAUTY OF IT IS
THAT YOU COULD TAKE --

00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,351
AND JUST WITH PACKAGING

00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:33,320
DO DIFFERENT PACKAGING
FOR DIFFERENT THINGS.

00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,321
YEAH.

00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:36,156
I REALLY WANT TO GET
TO THE VALUATION NOW.

00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:37,424
PLEASE DON'T GO THERE.

00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:39,459
NO. IT'S NOT WORTH $2 MILLION,
YOU DON'T THINK?

00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,061
THE MARKET VALUE
FOR OUR COMPANY

00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,295
IS HIGHER THAN WE'RE OFFERING
THE SHARKS.

00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,396
ALL RIGHT, WE DON'T CARE
ABOUT MARKET VALUE HERE.

00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:44,431
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE,
RIGHT?

00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:46,066
WELL, <i>I</i> DO.
John: YOU DO?

00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:47,200
[ LAUGHS ]

00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,169
YOU GOT TO LEAVE, THEN,
'CAUSE YOU COULD GET THE MONEY.

00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:51,071
WELL, WE DON'T
JUST WANT THE MONEY.

00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:52,105
WE WANT THE EXPERTISE.

00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:53,340
LET ME HELP
CLEAR THE AIR HERE, OKAY?

00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,175
THIS PRODUCT ISN'T
GOING TO ACTUALLY WORK

00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:57,110
UNLESS
IT'S VERY INEXPENSIVE.
Woodman: YES.

00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,412
TO ME, SOME ELEMENT OF IT
IS TCHOTCHKE.

00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:01,247
WHY DO YOU KEEP
SAYING THAT?

00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:02,349
TCHOTCHKE IS JUST STUFF
THAT SITS THERE.
LET ME FINISH, ALL RIGHT?

00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:04,250
THIS DOES SOMETHING.
LET ME FINISH.
RIGHT.

00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,052
PEOPLE USE IT.
IT WORKS.

00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,220
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,390
I'M LISTENING, AND IT SAYS,
"I'M A PIECE OF CRAP."

00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,126
THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE
WHO E-MAIL US EVERY DAY

00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:14,227
AND CALL US AND TELL US

00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:16,296
HOW IT'S MADE
A HUGE IMPACT IN THEIR LIFE.

00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:19,132
THIS DUDE'S PASSIONATE.
YOU'RE STRIKING A NERVE.
AND SO MAYBE TO YOU,
IT'S A $15 PIECE OF CRAP...

00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:21,001
HE'S PASSIONATE,
AND I DIG IT.

00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,003
YOU GOT EMOTIONAL.
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN.
O'Leary:
LET ME FINISH, OKAY?

00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,071
SO, WHEN I LOOK AT IT AND SAY,
"HOW DO I MAKE MONEY?" --

00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:26,172
WHICH IS
ALL I CARE ABOUT --

00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,208
I'LL SELL A PIECE OF CRAP
IF I CAN PROFIT FROM IT.

00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,143
I HAVE NO PROBLEM AT ALL
DOING THAT.

00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:31,244
<i>I</i> DO.

00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,979
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT CAPITALISM
IS, ALL RIGHT?

00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,114
THAT'S NOT
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT FOR ME.

00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:35,949
YOU MAY FALL INTO
THE "PIECE OF CRAP" CATEGORY.

00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,450
KEVIN! IF YOU SAY
"PIECE OF CRAP" ONE MORE TIME --

00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,253
YOU DEFINITELY DO NOT WANT
THIS GUY AS AN INVESTOR.
LET ME FINISH!
SILENCE! PLEASE!

00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,989
LET ME FINISH.
WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN MAKING
A PIECE OF CRAP, KEVIN.

YOU KNOW WHAT? JUST STOP.
JUST STOP TALKING.
AND SO, I --
JUST LET ME FINISH.

YOU KNOW WHY HE NEEDS
TO STOP TALKING?

LET ME FINISH!
NO. I'M NOT EVEN GONNA
LET HIM FINISH.

00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,065
YOU DO NOT WANT HIM
AS AN INVESTOR.
LORI, I BEG YOU.

00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:54,167
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA
LET HIM FINISH,
ARE YOU GONNA
ASK HIM AGAIN

00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:55,301
BECAUSE I'M SICK OF HEARING HIM
SAY IT'S A PIECE OF CRAP.
HOW YOU CAN LOWER
THE COST OF THE GOODS?

AND I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER.

00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,404
OH! EXCELLENT.

AND THE FACT
THAT THIS HELPS PEOPLE OUT.

00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,349
I MEAN,
IT'S GREAT TO MAKE MONEY,

00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,151
BUT THIS MATTERS TO ME
A LOT.

00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:12,252
I DON'T NEED THIS MONEY.

00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:14,454
I CAN SURVIVE.
I CAN PAY MY BILLS WITHOUT THIS.

IT'S A PIECE OF CRAP...

I DO.
BUT I DON'T CARE.

00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,128
I UNDERSTAND.

DON'T OFFER US MONEY.

IT'S OUR OBLIGATION
TO DO THAT

00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,243
BECAUSE WE SAID
WE WERE GONNA DO THAT.

00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,310
THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME.
YES, AND I UNDERSTAND THAT.

00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,346

AND FULFILL THAT PURCHASE ORDER.

"OH, PLEASE,
GO TO MY COMPETITOR...
NO. YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:41,394

00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,342
Krippendorf:
I MEAN, I PERSONALLY THINK,

00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,278
YOU KNOW, THAT THE COMPANY'S
WORTH MORE THAN THAT --

00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,312
A LOT MORE THAN THAT.

00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,247
APPARENTLY NOT.
YOU'VE GOT TWO OFFERS.

00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:02,448
WE HAVE A BETTER OFFER
FOR YOU.

00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,987
LORI AND I
HAVE REVISED OUR OFFER.

00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:11,324
WE'RE NOW OFFERING YOU
$100,000 FOR 20%,

00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:14,193
MATCHING DAYMOND'S OFFER.

00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:16,062
'CAUSE WE'RE PASSIONATE
ABOUT THIS.

00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:18,431
IT REMINDS ME
OF WHEN I STARTED GoPro.

00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:22,201
YOU'RE NOT JUST SELLING CRAP,
LIKE O'LEARY THINKS YOU ARE.

00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,370
THERE'S PURPOSE
TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,272
BOTH OF US
BELIEVE IN YOU,

00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,141
AND WE BELIEVE IN WHAT WE CAN
ALL DO TOGETHER AS A TEAM.

00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,175
AND THEY OBVIOUSLY
DON'T LISTEN VERY WELL,

00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,310
'CAUSE YOU'VE SAID
MULTIPLE TIMES

00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,978
THAT YOU BELIEVE
THE VALUATION IS FAR HIGHER --

00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,047
MARK, YOU GONNA MAKE AN OFFER
OR GIVE THEM A LECTURE?

00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:36,182
I'M JUST LISTEN--
I'M JUST WAITING,
LETTING THESE GUYS TALK

00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:39,218
'CAUSE THEY LIKE
TO HEAR THEMSELVES TALK.
GUYS, I SAID EXACTLY
WHAT THEY SAID 20 MINUTES AGO,

00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:41,020
WHEN NOBODY ELSE WAS
ON THE TABLE.

00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,022
WILL YOU DO 20%
FOR $200,000?

00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,159
Greiner: NO.
NO.

00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,228
AH, REALITY.
Woodman: AND HERE'S
THE REASON WHY.

00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:51,264
IT'S BECAUSE
WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO

00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:53,199
BECOME INVESTED PERSONALLY
IN YOUR BUSINESS

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,233
AND HELP YOU GUYS SUCCEED.

00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,269
MARK, ARE YOU OUT?

00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:57,303
NO.

00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:58,438
OH, MY GOD.
[ LAUGHS ]

00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,173
I NEVER SAID I WAS OUT.

00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,374
John: GUYS, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:03,176
I'M NOTICING
YOU COUNTERED OVER THERE,

00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:06,145
AND THEN
YOU'RE TALKING TO MARK.

00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:07,980
YOU ALREADY KNEW
WHERE KEVIN WAS HEADING.

00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,016
YOU'RE NOT EVEN
ADDRESSING ME,

00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,451
SO MAYBE I'M NOT
THE RIGHT PERSON...
[ LAUGHS ]

00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:13,286
THAT YOU WANT
TO DO THE DEAL WITH.

00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:15,188
I DON'T WANT
TO BLUR YOUR VISION.

00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,389
WE'RE ABSOLUTELY INTERESTED
IN WORKING --

00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:19,225
OKAY, I THINK YOU SHOULD BE
TALKING TO ME AND THEM.

00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:21,361
WELL, I THINK WE'RE INTERESTED
IN HEARING EVERYONE'S OPINION,

00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,396
AND --
YES, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE LIKE DECISIVE PARTNERS.

00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:26,299
YOU HAVE TO
MAKE A DECISION.

00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:28,167
Let's just take it.

00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,003
YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:33,172
WE REALLY WANTED TO WORK
WITH LORI AND NICK,

00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,141
AND ALSO DAYMOND,
WHEN WE CAME IN,

00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:37,110
BUT WE GET
TWO OF YOU GUYS.
YEAH.

00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,113
WE WOULD BE THRILLED
TO TAKE YOUR OFFER.

00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:41,147
WHOO-HOO!
YAY.

00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:42,448
Tseng: THANK YOU SO MUCH,
DAYMOND.

00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,351
Woodman:
HEY, NICE WORK.
[ GREINER LAUGHS ]

00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:48,087
DO YOU MIND
IF I DOCUMENT THIS MOMENT?

00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:49,088
OH, GoPro.

00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,056
[ CAMERA BEEPS ]

00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,257
GROUP HUG!
[ GRUNTS ]

00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,993
NOW YOU GUYS HAVE
A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,294
WE'RE GONNA
GET THAT PRICE DOWN.
SWEET!

00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,163
CONGRATS, ROOK.
GOOD JOB.

00:14:57,163 --> 00:14:58,297
THANK YOU.
John:
I LOVE YOUR PASSION.

00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,133
YOUR DECISION-MAKING SUCKS.

00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:03,202
Krippendorf: I'M REALLY EXCITED
THAT WE HAVE NICK AND LORI.

00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:06,005
OUR GOAL WAS NOT JUST
TO BUILD A SMALL COMPANY.

00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:08,941
WE WANT TO BUILD THIS INTO
A $100-MILLION-A-YEAR COMPANY,

00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:12,178
AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS GONNA
BE A HUGE STEP FOR US.

00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:26,292
MY NAME IS CAMERON SHELDRAKE.
I'M FROM ITHACA, NEW YORK.

00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,361
AND I'M THE FOUNDER
OF OFF THE COB.

00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:32,331
MY FAMILY FARM HAS BEEN
OPERATING HERE SINCE THE '60s,

00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:35,401
SO, NATURALLY, FARMING IS
A HUGE PART OF MY LIFE.

00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:40,406
ONE OF THE CROPS WE GROW
A TON OF IS FRESH SWEET CORN.

00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:43,142
EVERYONE IN MY FAMILY LOVES IT,
INCLUDING MY DOG.

00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,211
Sheldrake:
OH, IS THAT GOOD, BARRY?

00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:48,080
UNFORTUNATELY,
OUR SUPPLY OF FRESH SWEET CORN

00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,116
OFTEN OUTWEIGHS THE DEMAND,

00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:53,419
SO WE END UP
THROWING AWAY A LOT.

00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,055
I HAD TO FIND SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THIS CORN,

00:15:56,055 --> 00:16:00,293
SO I MADE A PLAN TO CHANGE IT
FROM WASTEFUL TO TASTEFUL.

00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,994
THERE'S A NEED FOR MY PRODUCT

00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,030
BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT
THEY'VE BEEN MISSING OUT ON.

00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,065
IT WAS
REALLY GOOD PICKING.

00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,234
MY BUSINESS IS
REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME

00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:10,369
BECAUSE WE'RE HELPING
TO SUSTAIN MY FAMILY FARM,

00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,371
AND SO IF I DON'T GET A DEAL
FROM THE SHARKS,

00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:14,073
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'LL DO.

00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:37,129
HI. I'M CAMERON SHELDRAKE,
AND MY COMPANY IS OFF THE COB.

00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:41,167
I'M SEEKING $100,000 IN EXCHANGE
FOR 10-- OR 15%...

00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,335
[ LAUGHS ]
...OF MY COMPANY.

00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,003
IT <i>ALREADY</i> WENT UP?

00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,106
WHICH WOULD YOU RATHER EAT --
SWEET CORN OR GRAIN CORN?

00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,274
DID YOU KNOW
THAT MOST TORTILLA CHIPS

00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:49,408
ARE MADE WITH GRAIN CORN?

00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:53,279
GRAIN CORN HAS HARD, DRY KERNELS
AND A STARCHY FLAVOR.

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,381
IT'S MACHINE-HARVESTED
IN THE FALL,

00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,183
ONCE THE PLANT HAS DIED

00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,385
AND THE KERNELS HAVE HARDENED
ON THE COB.

00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:02,188
GRAIN CORN IS USED
MOSTLY TO FEED TO ANIMALS

00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,123
AND TO MAKE ETHANOL.

00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:05,391
I PREFER FRESH SWEET CORN,

00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:08,361
LIKE YOU'D BOIL OR GRILL
AND EAT RIGHT OFF THE COB,

00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,196
AND THAT'S WHY I STARTED

00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:13,132
OFF THE COB
SWEET CORN TORTILLA CHIPS.

00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:15,167
WE MAKE THE FIRST
AND ONLY TORTILLA CHIPS

00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,003
WITH FRESH-PICKED SWEET CORN.

00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:18,304
SWEET CORN GIVES OUR CHIPS

00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:21,240
A SAVORY, SWEET,
REAL CORN-ON-THE-COB FLAVOR,

00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,311
NOT THAT BLAND, STARCHY FLAVOR
GRAIN CORN GIVES MOST CHIPS.

00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:28,080
NOT ONLY DO OFF THE COB
SWEET CORN TORTILLA CHIPS

00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,049
TASTE BETTER,
BUT THEY'RE BETTER <i>FOR</i> YOU.

00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:34,053
THEY'RE MADE WITH ORGANIC,
NON-GENETICALLY MODIFIED CORN.

00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,056
THEY'RE GLUTEN-FREE,
NO CHOLESTEROL, NO TRANS FAT,

00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,324
AND VERY LOW SODIUM.

00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:42,094
SO, SHARKS, WHO WANTS TO HELP ME
CHANGE THE CHIP IN YOUR DIP?

00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:44,196
ARE YOU GONNA
LET US TRY SOME?
OF COURSE.

00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,098
GREAT.
GREAT NAME, BY THE WAY.

00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:47,166
THANK YOU.

00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,101
Woodman: IT SAYS IT ALL
IN THE NAME, AND IT'S FUN.

00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,270
THANK YOU.

00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,006
SOME SALSA.
THANK YOU.

00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,207
Woodman:
GREAT PACKAGING, TOO.

00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,310
Sheldrake: YEAH, WE JUST
LAUNCHED THIS NEW PACKAGING

00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,011
ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO.
THANK YOU.

00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:00,346
APPRECIATE IT.

00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:03,282
HOW LONG AGO
DID YOU LAUNCH THIS?
THIS IS VERY GOOD.

00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,084
WE'VE ONLY BEEN SELLING CHIPS
FOR 13 MONTHS.

00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,085
WHERE IS IT SOLD?

00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,020
IT'S SOLD
IN NATURAL GROCERY STORES,

00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,289
SUCH AS WHOLE FOODS AND WEGMANS
IN THE NORTHEAST.

00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,291
IT'S HARD
TO GET INTO WEGMANS.
HOW MANY STORES?

00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,126
WE'RE IN 45 STORES
RIGHT NOW.

00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:16,062
I HAVE A QUESTION.

00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:18,230
I NEVER REALIZED
THAT THE TORTILLA CHIPS

00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,033
OR CORN CHIPS THAT WE EAT
ARE FROM GRAIN CORN.

00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,970
IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE TO PUT
THE SWEET CORN IN THE CHIP.

00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,972
IT'S ACTUALLY
20 TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE

00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:28,040
THAN CONVENTIONAL CORN.
MM.

00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,344
WE'RE PAYING $5.50 A POUND
FOR DRIED SWEET CORN.

00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:35,147
MOST GRAIN-CORN FLOUR COSTS
ABOUT 30 CENTS A POUND.

00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,415
Greiner: SO, WHAT IS
A BAG OF THESE...
WOW.
WHOA.

00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,416
REALLY?

00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,352
...COMPARED
TO A BAG OF CHIPS

00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:42,054
THAT IS GRAIN CORN
THE SAME SIZE?

00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:45,191
MOST CONVENTIONAL TORTILLA CHIPS
ARE, LIKE, 99 CENTS.

00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:47,259
WE'RE A LITTLE BIT
MORE EXPENSIVE.

00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,261
WE'RE AT $3.49
AT WHOLE FOODS.

00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:52,098
WE WERE ACTUALLY
IN 20 WHOLE FOODS AT ONE POINT,

00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:55,034
BUT WE WERE OUT OF STOCK
FOR SO LONG, WE LOST OUR SPACE,

00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:57,370
SO RIGHT NOW, I'M BATTLING
TO GET BACK THAT SPACE.

00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,406
THEY TASTE GREAT,
BUT THE DELTA IN PRICE

00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:04,410
BETWEEN THE 30 CENTS
I CAN BUY GRAIN CORN FOR

00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,146
AND THE $5
I HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS,

00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,416
IT'S NOT REFLECTED, IN MY VIEW,
IN THE TASTE DIFFERENCE.

00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,451
WELL, I THINK THERE'S
A GROWING AMOUNT OF PEOPLE

00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:14,453
THAT ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
THAT'S HEALTHIER.

00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,088
NO, I GET --
THAT'S ON-TREND,

00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,323
BUT THEN
YOU RUN INTO THE PROBLEM

00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,125
WE'VE SEEN MANY TIMES
ON "SHARK TANK"

00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,427
WHEN PEOPLE COME IN
WITH HEALTHIER OPTIONS

00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:23,429
AND THEN RUN INTO
THAT GRAVITY OF DISTRIBUTION --

00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:25,264
THE CHALLENGING
OF CONVINCING LARGE --

00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:26,999
THERE'S WHOLE FOODS
EVERYWHERE.

00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:30,236
WHAT HAVE YOU SOLD, TOTAL,
IN THE LIFETIME?

00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:32,204
ABOUT 45,000 SO FAR.

00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,073
THAT'S YOUR SALES?
DOLLARS?

00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:35,941
YEAH.
DOLLARS?

00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,276
YOU'RE NOT
MAKING ANY MONEY YET.

00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:38,944
NO.
OKAY.

00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:41,113
IF ANOTHER YEAR GOES BY
AND YOU HAVEN'T MADE ANY MONEY,

00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:42,281
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,350
WELL, THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN,
BECAUSE IN JANUARY,

00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,153
WE'RE STARTING WITH THE LARGEST
DISTRIBUTOR OF NATURAL FOODS

00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:50,022
IN THE UNITED STATES
AND GOING OUT TO 100 STORES.

00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,457
WHAT ARE YOU MAKING IT FOR
RIGHT NOW?

00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:53,325
RIGHT NOW,
IT'S ABOUT 85 CENTS.

00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,161
OH!
Greiner: PER BAG?
YEAH.

00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:57,163
WHAT DO YOU SELL IT
TO THE DISTRIBUTORS FOR?

00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:59,198
FOR $1.60 TO $1.70
PER BAG.

00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,133
YOU KNOW,
I HAVE A VERY SIMPLE MODEL.

00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,035
IF THE BUSINESS,
AFTER THREE YEARS,

00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,370
ISN'T MAKING MONEY,
I CALL IT A HOBBY.

00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,105
AND IF IT'S NOT
A HOBBY OF YOURS,

00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:08,107
YOU SHOULD TAKE IT
BEHIND THE BARN AND SHOOT IT.

00:20:08,107 --> 00:20:09,975
SO YOU HAVE
ANOTHER 12 MONTHS

00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:12,078
TO PROVE

00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:33,452
PERSONALLY, I THINK GOING FOR
THE CAMPING MARKET IS ALL RIGHT.

00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:35,387
THIS IS NOT
AN INTUITIVE PRODUCT

00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:38,123
TO BUY WITHOUT SEEING
THE DEMONSTRATION, RIGHT?
YEAH.
MM-HMM.

00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:40,025
THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS
A TOUGH DEAL.

00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:44,229
SOMEBODY HAS TO DO A LOT OF WORK
TO...PREPARE FOR THIS.

00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:46,198
THE HAVE TO PLAN AHEAD.
PEOPLE AREN'T GONNA TAKE --

00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:48,000
IT SEEMS LIKE A SURVIVAL,
SORT OF DISASTER --

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,268
THIS IS NOT GONNA BE
AN IMPULSE BUY.

00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:51,236
"OH, YEAH. WAIT --
OH, GEEZ.

00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:53,372
I CAN COOK MY OWN SALMON
AT WORK," RIGHT?

00:27:53,372 --> 00:27:55,440
IT'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING
THAT TRIGGERS THAT, RIGHT?

00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,042
WELL --

00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,278

AND FOR THOSE REASONS, I'M OUT.

SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,283
SO -- SO,
A REALLY IMPORTANT THING

00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:06,385
WHEN YOU COME UP
WITH A CONCEPT

00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:11,023
IS THAT YOU SOLVE
A PERVASIVE PROBLEM FOR PEOPLE

00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:14,226
AND YOU DON'T TRY TO CREATE
A NEW WAY TO DO SOMETHING

00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:16,328

BROKEN.

YES. YES.
AND THEY SHOULD HAVE THIS.

00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:32,110
FINDING THAT PERSON IS
THE BIG CHALLENGE.

00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:35,180
I'M NOT EVER GONNA BE
THAT PERSON HANGING OFF A ROCK,

00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,049

CARRIES ME UP THERE.

IS IT SOMETHING
PEOPLE NEED AND WANT?

00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:51,163
IS IT GONNA FILL
A BROAD AUDIENCE?

00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:53,298
IS IT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE MADE
AT AN AFFORDABLE PRICE?

00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:55,200
I'M SORRY.
CAN I ASK YOU THIS --

00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,436
CAN YOU JUST USE THIS
AS A REGULAR WATER BOTTLE?

00:28:57,436 --> 00:28:59,338

OF COMPETITION

IT NEVER MAKES SENSE

AGAINST SOMETHING

ALREADY BEEN MADE

FOR ABOUT 15 YEARS,

TO MY LAWYER?

NO.

00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:15,013
SMELLS GOOD.

00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:18,183
WHAT DOES ONE OF THESE
COST THE CUSTOMER?

00:35:18,183 --> 00:35:21,119
A CASE OF SIX,
THEY RUN AROUND $20 TO $22.

00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,321
WHAT DOES
THE COMPETITION COST?
A CASE OF SIX.
AND WHAT IS ONE?

00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:25,423
WE ACTUALLY GO FOR $1 LESS THAN
WHAT THEY'RE SELLING THEM FOR.

00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:29,060
IS THERE ANOTHER
"EARTH-FRIENDLY" LOG OUT THERE?

00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,096
THERE ARE,
BUT NONE OF THEM ARE SCENTED.

00:35:31,096 --> 00:35:32,330
BUT I'M NOT COMPETING
WITH THEM.

00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,099
THEY'RE ACTUALLY COMPETING
WITH <i>ME.</i>

00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:35,967
I HAVE A BETTER PRODUCT,
AND THEY KNOW IT.

00:35:36,401 --> 00:35:37,402
LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE BUSINESS.

00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:40,071
WE'VE HAD
ABOUT 200,000 IN SALES.

00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:42,007
O'Leary: DOLLARS?
IN WHAT PERIOD OF TIME?
SINCE WHEN?

00:35:42,007 --> 00:35:43,241
IT'S A FOUR-YEAR PERIOD,

00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:45,977
BUT WHAT YOU
HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS --
$200,000 IN FOUR YEARS?

00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,212
WHAT YOU
HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS

00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:49,047
I DIDN'T START THIS
AS A BUSINESS.

00:35:49,047 --> 00:35:51,316
IT HAPPENED ORGANICALLY
AND ACCIDENTALLY.

00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:53,385
WHAT HAPPENED
IN THE LAST YEAR IN SALES?

00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:56,187
WE ONLY DID $50,000 LAST YEAR,
BUT LET ME --

00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:57,455
I KNOW
YOU DON'T LIKE THAT ANSWER.

00:35:57,455 --> 00:36:00,325
I <i>HATE</i> THE ANSWER.
WE DID $100,000
THE YEAR BEFORE.

00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:03,461
LAST YEAR, SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
HAD ITS HOTTEST WINTER

00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:05,063
IN 100 YEARS.

00:36:05,063 --> 00:36:06,431
THAT MEANS YOU'RE NOT SELLING
OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:10,001
ABSOLUTELY. WE ARE NOT.
THE NORTHEAST HAD ITS COLDEST
WINTER SINCE YOU WERE BORN.

00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,102
WE DIDN'T HAVE
THE DISTRIBUTION

00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:12,404
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE
THE MANUFACTURING.

00:36:12,404 --> 00:36:15,340
I WENT FROM MAKING THESE
IN MY KITCHEN

00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,375
FOR MYSELF
AND MY FRIENDS --

00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:20,145
MY FRIENDS SAID, "YOU SHOULD
TAKE IT TO THE LOCAL MARKET

00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:21,246
AND TRY TO SELL IT."

00:36:21,246 --> 00:36:23,348
I TOOK IT
JUST TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD MARKET.

00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:25,216
HE SOLD OUT IN ABOUT A WEEK.

00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,485
SO I SAID, "WOW. I'M GONNA GO
TO THE OTHER MARKET."

00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:29,421
EVERYBODY WAS
SELLING THEM OUT.

00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:31,456
SO I SAID, "I THINK
I'VE GOT SOMETHING HERE."

00:36:31,456 --> 00:36:33,391
I STARTED MAKING
MORE AND MORE OF THEM.

00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:35,260
WE WOULD PUT THEM
IN A BARREL,

00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,162
PUT IT IN THE FORM,
AND PRESS THEM BY HAND.

00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:39,431
THIS IS A COMMODITY BUSINESS,
OKAY?
YES.

00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:42,467
THERE'S FOUR OR FIVE RETAILERS
THAT HAVE 80% OF THE MARKET.

00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:45,236
I'LL NAME TWO --
COSTCO, HOME DEPOT.

00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:48,106
OKAY.
SO, WHEN YOU CALLED THOSE BUYERS
WITH YOUR CLAIMS

00:36:48,106 --> 00:36:50,275
THAT YOU WERE BETTER,
WHAT DID THEY SAY TO YOU?

00:36:50,275 --> 00:36:53,011
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
I HEARD MARK CUBAN SAY,

00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:55,180
"NOBODY DOESN'T RETURN
<i>MY</i> CALL."

00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:58,116
UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME,
<i>NOBODY</i> RETURNS MY CALLS.

00:36:58,116 --> 00:36:59,317
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:01,252
I'VE SUBMITTED
TO HOME DEPOT --
THAT'S YOUR ANSWER?

00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:03,021
NO, I WANT TO TELL YOU --

00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:04,322
I'VE BEEN TO
ALL MY LOCAL HOME DEPOTS,

00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:06,057
AND THE MANAGERS SAY,
"WE LOVE IT,

00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,159
"BUT YOU HAVE TO GO TO ATLANTA
TO SUBMIT,

00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,327
OR YOU HAVE TO GO ONLINE."

00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:10,995
YOU ALSO MENTIONED COSTCO.

00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:13,198
COSTCO WANTS US
TO GO INTO THEIR STORES.

00:37:13,198 --> 00:37:16,101
OKAY.
THEY OFFERED US
A FOUR-STORE DEAL.

00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:18,103
I'M HOLDING OFF ON THAT
RIGHT NOW.

00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:19,270
WHY?

00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,239
HOW CAN YOU SELL SOMETHING
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE?

00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,141
WHAT, AM I GONNA GO TO COSTCO
AND TELL THEM

00:37:23,141 --> 00:37:25,143
"SURE, HERE'S OUR GREAT PRODUCT"
AND THEN THEY WANT TO ORDER IT,

00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:26,377
AND I SAY, "SORRY.
I CAN'T FILL YOUR ORDER"?

00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:29,180
IF YOU'RE GONNA TRY
AND ATTRACT AN INVESTOR HERE,

00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,449
THERE HAS TO BE
A DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY, OKAY?

00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:34,185
WHY DON'T YOU PICK
<i>ONE</i> NATIONAL RETAILER?

00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:37,055
I HAVE
A LETTER OF INTENT.

00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:38,456
ALL RIGHT, FROM WHO?
WE JUST CLOSED A DEAL

00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:41,426
FROM ONE OF THE LARGEST GROCERS
IN THE COUNTRY, ALBERTSONS.

00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:42,360
GROCERS? OKAY.
WOW.

00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,062
TEST OR NATIONAL ROLLOUT?

00:37:44,062 --> 00:37:45,396
WELL, THEY WANTED US
TO GO NATIONAL,

00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:48,166
AND I TOLD THEM, BECAUSE OF
OUR LIMITED DISTRIBUTION STILL,

00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:50,034
WE WANT TO DO
THE 180 CALIFORNIA STORES

00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:51,302
UNTIL WE CAN
INCREASE PRODUCTION.

00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:53,438
WOULD THEY HAVE TAKEN YOU
TO MORE THAN 180

00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,306
IF YOU COULD HAVE
SUPPLIED THEM?

00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:58,343
YES, THEY ACTUALLY WANTED US
TO GO INTO 3,200 STORES.

00:37:58,343 --> 00:38:00,311
Greiner: REALLY?
HEY! GOOD FOR YOU.

00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:02,447
LAST YEAR, ANOTHER
NATIONAL RETAIL GROCERY STORE,

00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:05,416
VONS PAVILIONS,
ASKED US TO GO IN, AS WELL.

00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:08,153
THEY SAID THEIR MINIMUM ORDER
WOULD BE 22 TRAILERS.

00:38:08,153 --> 00:38:11,055
I SAID, "THERE'S NO WAY
I COULD DO THAT IN 22 YEARS."

00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:12,257
WHAT'S YOUR SOLUTION
FOR THAT?

00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:14,425
AUTOMATION.
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,361
I'M LOOKING FOR THE FUNDING
TO BUILD THE MACHINES

00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:18,062
TO GET US
TO FULL AUTOMATION.

00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:20,265
DO THOSE MACHINES
CURRENTLY EXIST?
THEY DON'T.

00:38:20,265 --> 00:38:23,168
WE ACTUALLY HAVE A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT PROPRIETARY PROCESS

00:38:23,168 --> 00:38:25,203
THAT WE'VE JUST RECENTLY
FILED FOR PATENTS FOR.

00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:27,138
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THIS AND DURAFLAME...

00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,340
WELL, FIRST, LET ME --
LET ME ADDRESS --
...OTHER THAN THE SCENTS?

00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:33,411
ALL THE OTHER FIRE LOGS ARE MADE
FROM SAWDUST AND SLACK WAX.

00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:37,148
SLACK WAX IS A VERY HEAVILY
OIL-LADEN, SMELLY WAX.

00:38:38,216 --> 00:38:39,317
I LOVE IT.

00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,120
I WILL BE A CUSTOMER
BECAUSE IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT,

00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,388
BUT IT'S NOT YET
A COMPANY.

00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:45,456
I'VE GOT TO BE ABLE
TO SAY,

00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:47,992
"IS IT WORTH MY TIME
AND MY TEAM'S TIME

00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:51,329
TO TAKE THIS FROM GROUND ZERO
TO WHERE YOU THINK IT COULD GO?"

00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,032
IF YOU WERE FURTHER ALONG,
YEAH, RIGHT?

00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:56,067
BUT YOU'RE NOT TO THE POINT
WHERE YOU JUST NEED PHONE CALLS.

00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:59,370
YOU NEED <i>EVERYTHING,</i>
AND EVERYTHING IS A LOT OF WORK,

00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,139
AND THAT'S WHY I'M OUT.

00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:03,074
OKAY.

00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:04,108
I AGREE WITH MARK.

00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:05,243
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK

00:39:05,243 --> 00:39:07,278
TO BUILD THE ORGANIZATION
AROUND YOU.

00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,080
THIS IS OUT OF
THE GoPro PLAYBOOK --

00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,082
WE ALWAYS KNEW WE HAD
A REALLY BIG OPPORTUNITY,

00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:13,418
BUT WE RECOGNIZED
WE WERE, LIKE, EIGHT PEOPLE,

00:39:13,418 --> 00:39:16,387
AND WE NEEDED TO START
WITH SMALL RETAILERS,

00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:19,991
BUILD A BRAND,
BUILD AN ORGANIZATION, YOU KNOW,

00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:22,193
AND WHEN BEST BUY CALLED,
WE WERE READY FOR IT.

00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,062
AND I THINK
YOU'RE TRYING TO GO

00:39:24,062 --> 00:39:27,065
FROM ZERO TO 1,000 MILES AN HOUR
RIGHT AWAY.

00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:29,334
I THINK YOU'LL SUCCEED,

00:39:29,334 --> 00:39:32,003
BUT BECAUSE YOU HAVE
SO MUCH WORK TO DO,

00:39:32,003 --> 00:39:33,204
I'M OUT.

00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,139
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:36,207
TOM, LISTEN, UM,

00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,409
I THINK YOU HAVE
A REALLY AMAZING PRODUCT,

00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:40,411
BUT I THINK YOU HAVE
A LOT OF STEPS TO GO.

00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:42,080
I THINK YOU WILL MAKE IT,

00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,948
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
FIGURE IT OUT.

00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:45,984
IT'S A LITTLE TOO EARLY
FOR ME.

00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:47,085
SO WITH THAT, I'M OUT.

00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:49,287
OKAY.

00:39:49,287 --> 00:39:51,422
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I WAS IN THE BASEMENT

00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:55,293
BACK IN THE LATE '80s
STARING THE LEARNING COMPANY,

00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:57,228
AND AFTER I'D GO GET
A $12 MILLION ORDER

00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,430
FOR READER RABBIT,

00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:02,166
IT WOULD BLOW UP BEHIND ME --
THE LOGISTICS.

00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:04,135
I COULDN'T DELIVER.

00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:06,104
AND I MET A GUY
NAMED MIKE PERIK.

00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:10,308
I GAVE HIM HALF MY EQUITY
TO SOLVE MY PROBLEM.

00:40:10,308 --> 00:40:14,379
WE SOLD THE COMPANY
FOR $4.2 BILLION 5 YEARS LATER.

00:40:14,379 --> 00:40:17,248
BEST INVESTMENT
I EVER MADE.

00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,284
YOU HAVE TO FIND
YOUR MIKE PERIK.

00:40:19,284 --> 00:40:21,052
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:22,186
I DON'T WANT A JOB.

00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:24,155
I JUST WANT
TO INVEST MY MONEY

00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:26,324
SO I CAN SIT ON THE DOCK
WITH MY TOES IN THE WATER.

00:40:26,324 --> 00:40:29,160
LOOK, I HAVE
A CERTAIN SENSE OF FRUSTRATION,

00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,395
BUT I SEE ME IN YOU.

00:40:30,395 --> 00:40:33,298
GO FIND YOUR MICHAEL PERIK.
DO IT.

00:40:33,298 --> 00:40:35,333
YOU'LL MAKE
A LOT OF MONEY.

00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:36,968
GOOD LUCK. I'M OUT.

00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:39,971
THANK YOU.

00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:42,974
IT'S YOU AND I.

00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:44,208
AND THEN THERE WAS ONE.

00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:45,376
YES.

00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:49,147
YOU KNOW, YOU MAKE ME THINK OF
A PRODUCT CALLED ScreenMend,

00:40:49,147 --> 00:40:50,949
WHICH PATCHED YOUR SCREENS.

00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,016
LOVE IT.

00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:53,151
THEY WERE MAKING IT
OUT OF THE GARAGE.

00:40:53,151 --> 00:40:55,320
I LOVED THE PRODUCT.
I THOUGHT IT WAS BRILLIANT.

00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,289
SO I TOOK A GAMBLE
ON THEM.

00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:02,260
TO DATE, WE'VE DONE
$1 MILLION IN SALES IN A YEAR.

00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,195
I LOVE YOUR PRODUCT.

00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:06,030
I LIKE THE NAME --
EARTH-LOG.

00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,432
I THINK
IT'S SUPER-APPEALING.

00:41:07,432 --> 00:41:09,968
I LOVE
THAT THEY SMELL GOOD.

00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:13,237
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS,
I LIKE.

00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:15,106
SO I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER.

00:41:15,106 --> 00:41:16,975
AND IT'S GONNA BE
A BLOODSUCKING ONE.

00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:18,343
[ CHUCKLES ]
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU AN OFFER,
STILL AN OFFER.

00:41:18,343 --> 00:41:20,211
BUT IT'S GONNA BE
A REALISTIC OFFER

00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:22,246
BECAUSE I KNOW
WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE

00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:25,016
TO TAKE YOU
FROM WHERE YOU ARE

00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:27,318
TO ACTUALLY BEING ABLE
TO MANUFACTURE THIS,

00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,420
GET THIS OUT
INTO RETAILERS EVERYWHERE.

00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:33,157
SO I'M GONNA OFFER YOU
$160,000,

00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:36,094
BUT I'D LIKE 35%.

00:41:36,094 --> 00:41:39,998
AND RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW,
ALL THE PLACES ScreenMend IS --

00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:43,167
BED BATH &amp; BEYOND,
HOME DEPOT, LOWE'S --

00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,237
I THINK THAT I CAN GET YOU
INTO ALL OF THESE PLACES, TOO.

00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,145
DEAL.
DEAL!

00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:55,380
[ LAUGHS ]
YAY!

00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,415
THAT WAS EASY.
[ LAUGHS ]

00:41:57,415 --> 00:41:59,384
LORI, THAT WAS NOT
A BLOODSUCKING OFFER.

00:41:59,384 --> 00:42:01,486
AWESOME! YAY!
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:42:01,486 --> 00:42:03,221
YOU'RE WELCOME.
I THINK WE'RE GONNA
BLOW THIS THING UP.

00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:04,255
I LOVE IT.

00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:06,190
HEY, TOM, HOW ABOUT
A LITTLE NEGOTIATION?

00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,159
