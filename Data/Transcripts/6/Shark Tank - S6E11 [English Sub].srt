Narrator:
WELCOME TO THE SHARK TANK,

00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:05,205
WHERE ENTREPRENEURS
SEEK AN INVESTMENT

00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:07,407
TO START, GROW, OR SAVE
THEIR BUSINESS.

00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:09,076
ARE YOU MARRIED?
NO, SIR.

00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:11,111
I LIKE LONG ROMANTIC WALKS
TO THE BANK.

00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:12,980
Narrator: IF THE SHARKS HEAR
A GREAT IDEA...

00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,081
WHOO-HOO!

00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:15,315
...THEY'LL INVEST
THEIR OWN MONEY...

00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:17,317
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU AN OFFER,
BUT I HAVE A CAVEAT.

00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:19,186
BUT I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU
WHAT THE CAVEAT IS

00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:20,454
UNTIL YOU GIVE ME
AN ANSWER.

00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:22,389
Narrator: ...AND FIGHT
EACH OTHER FOR A DEAL.

00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:24,291
SHE'S GIVING YOU
A JANET JACKSON DEAL

00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,293
'CAUSE SHE WANTS CONTROL.

00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,362
BUT THE ENTREPRENEURS
MUST GET THE FULL AMOUNT

00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:31,465
THEY'RE ASKING FOR, OR
THEY'LL WALK AWAY WITH NOTHING.

00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:32,466
YOU DON'T WANT
TO GO OUT ON THIS.

00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:34,034
I'M GONNA STEP OUT.

00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,169
AND TONIGHT, THE BIGGEST DEAL

00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:38,071
IN "SHARK TANK" HISTORY
TO DATE IS MADE.

00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:41,241
I'LL GIVE YOU $2.5 MILLION
FOR 10%.

00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:42,442
WOW.
Herjavec: WOW.

00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:45,245
THIS IS THE BEST OFFER
KEVIN'S EVER MADE TO SOMEBODY.

00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:46,413
ARE YOU GONNA TAKE MY DEAL
OR NOT?

00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:51,218
Narrator:
WHO ARE THE SHARKS?

00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:58,025
THEY'RE SELF-MADE
BUSINESS EXPERTS WORTH BILLIONS.

00:00:58,025 --> 00:01:00,460
KEVIN O'LEARY IS
A SHREWD VENTURE CAPITALIST

00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,362
WHO MADE HIS FORTUNE

00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:04,298
SELLING A CHILDREN'S
EDUCATIONAL COMPANY

00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:07,034
FOR OVER $4 BILLION.

00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:10,971
DAYMOND JOHN DOMINATED
THE FASHION WORLD WITH FUBU.

00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:14,007
NOW HE'S THE BRANDING EXPERT
BEHIND MULTIPLE GLOBAL BRANDS

00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:16,043
GENERATING BILLIONS IN SALES.

00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:19,980
ROBERT HERJAVEC, SON OF
AN IMMIGRANT FACTORY WORKER,

00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,148
FOUNDED ONE OF

00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:25,018
THE WORLD'S PREEMINENT
CYBER-SECURITY FIRMS.

00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:29,056
LORI GREINER, THE QUEEN OF QVC,
HOLDS OVER 100 PATENTS

00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:30,290
AND HAS LAUNCHED
OVER 400 PRODUCTS,

00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,460
GROSSING OVER A HALF A BILLION
DOLLARS IN SALES.

00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:38,165
AND MARK CUBAN,
RENOWNED BILLIONAIRE TECH MOGUL

00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:42,135
AND THE OUTSPOKEN OWNER
OF THE DALLAS MAVERICKS.

00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:52,279
MY NAME IS STEPHEN HERSH, AND
I'M FROM BROOKLYN, NEW YORK.

00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,014
SHOOT IT, SHOOT IT, SHOOT IT!

00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:56,016
I LIVE WITH MY TWO KIDS,
AVY AND LEAH.

00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:58,218
MY KIDS ARE AWESOME.
THEY MEAN EVERYTHING TO ME.

00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:01,121
GROWING UP, I WATCHED MY FATHER
START AND RUN A HANDBAG COMPANY.

00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,391
HE PUT EVERY PENNY HE HAD INTO
IT, AND HE TOOK A VERY BIG RISK.

00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:06,059
AND HE DID IT.

00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:08,195
HE BROKE OPEN ALL OF THE MAJOR
DEPARTMENT STORES,

00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:10,364
AND HIS BUSINESS TOOK OFF
VERY QUICKLY AFTER THAT.

00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:13,233
EVENTUALLY, MY FATHER AND
HIS PARTNER SOLD THEIR COMPANY

00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,401
FOR A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY.

00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:16,370
I DIDN'T GET ANY OF THE PROFITS,
AND I'M TOTALLY FINE WITH THAT.

00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,071
I DON'T FEEL THAT I'M ENTITLED
TO GET SOMETHING

00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,139
THAT I DIDN'T EARN.

00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,075
NOW MY DAD AND I
HAVE STARTED A NEW COMPANY

00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:23,310
IN A SIMILAR INDUSTRY.

00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,345
I GOT THOSE DESIGNS.
I'M LOOKING AT IT RIGHT NOW.

00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,214
WHEN WE STARTED THIS COMPANY,

00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:29,349
WE BOUGHT A TON OF INVENTORY,
HE HIRED A LOT OF PEOPLE.

00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:30,484
WE HADN'T EVEN SOLD ONE BAG YET,

00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,185
AND WE WERE SPENDING
ALL THIS MONEY.

00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:35,155
I HAD TO STOP MANUFACTURING
MY PRODUCT TEMPORARILY.

00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,356
MOST OF WHAT I'M DOING NOW

00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:39,026
IS PLANNING FOR A RELAUNCH
OF MY COMPANY.

00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:41,261
I'VE LEARNED FROM MY MISTAKES,
AND IT'S TIME TO ASK FOR HELP.

00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,230
A PARTNERSHIP
WITH THE RIGHT SHARK

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,431
CAN BRING MY BUSINESS BACK,

00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:48,035
AND IT CAN BE JUST AS SUCCESSFUL
AS MY DAD'S BUSINESS WAS BEFORE.

00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:08,221
HI. I'M STEPHEN HERSH,
AND I'M FROM BROOKLYN, NEW YORK.

00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,257
MY COMPANY IS BIAGGI,

00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:13,360
AND I'M SEEKING
AN INVESTMENT OF $500,000

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,229
IN EXCHANGE FOR 30%
OF MY COMPANY.

00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:18,432
WHETHER WE LIVE IN A HOUSE,
A CONDO, OR AN APARTMENT,

00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:20,967
IT ALWAYS SEEMS LIKE
WE HAVE SO MUCH STUFF

00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:23,036
AND NOT ENOUGH SPACE
TO STORE IT IN.

00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,371
VERY FEW THINGS EAT UP

00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,440
MORE OF OUR LIVING SPACE
THAN OUR LUGGAGE.

00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,276
BIAGGI LUGGAGE
IS YOUR STORAGE SOLUTION.

00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:34,014
ALL BIAGGI LUGGAGE FOLDS FLAT.

00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:40,287
OUR FOLDABLE SUITCASES
USE HINGE-LOCK TECHNOLOGY...

00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:44,291
...WHICH KEEPS THESE BAGS STURDY
WHILE IN USE

00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,993
AND EASY TO STORE
UNDER A BED OR ON A SHELF.

00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:50,197
OUR SUPER LIGHTWEIGHT ZIPSAK
IS A SMALL POUCH

00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:51,998
THAT AMAZINGLY TRANSFORMS

00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:54,434
INTO THIS FULLY FEATURED
FOUR-WHEELED SPINNER.

00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:59,005
IN THIS STANDARD PIECE
OF BEDROOM FURNITURE,

00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:01,408
I'VE STORED 11 PIECES
OF LUGGAGE.

00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,443
THINK ABOUT ALL OF THE SPACE

00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,178
THAT THIS LUGGAGE WOULD TAKE UP
IN YOUR HOME.

00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:07,447
OUR LUGGAGE IS THE LUGGAGE
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE

00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:10,083
WHEN YOU'RE TRAVELING
AND ALSO WHEN YOU'RE NOT.

00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,353
SO, WHICH ONE OF YOU
CAN WE WELCOME TO THE FOLD?

00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,355
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:18,325
WELL, PROVE TO ME PEOPLE CARE.
DO YOU HAVE ANY SALES?

00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:22,395
YES. SO, WE'VE HAD $2.5 MILLION
OF SALES IN TWO YEARS.

00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,065
WOW.

00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:26,433
SO, THE FIRST YEAR
WAS A FULL YEAR OF SELLING.

00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,336
THIS YEAR,
WE SOLD FOR SIX MONTHS.

00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:32,973
AND THEN, BASICALLY,
WE HIT PAUSE ON MANUFACTURING

00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:36,042
BECAUSE WE DID LEARN
SOME THINGS,

00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,210
AND WE DECIDED
THAT INSTEAD OF --

00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,945
SO, WHAT DID YOU LEARN?

00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,348
WHAT WE LEARNED WAS
THAT CONSUMER EDUCATION

00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:42,983
IS THE CHALLENGE
WITH THIS PRODUCT.

00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:46,119
WE BOUGHT A TON OF INVENTORY
STRAIGHT OFF THE BAT.

00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,288
AND THAT WAS DEFINITELY
A MISTAKE.

00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,123
WHEN YOU HIT THE ROADBLOCK,

00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,226
YOU HAD TO LIQUIDATE
A LOT OF YOUR INVENTORY.
CORRECT.

00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,996
SO, HOW MUCH OF YOUR OWN MONEY
DO YOU HAVE IN THIS?

00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:58,365
WE INVESTED $3.5 MILLION
INTO THIS BUSINESS.

00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,268
WOW!
$3.5 MILLION?!

00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:05,972
WE DIDN'T LOSE $3.5 MILLION, BUT
WE INVESTED THAT OFF THE BAT.

00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,240
WHO IS "WE"?

00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,943
ME AND MY FAMILY
AND OUR LONG-TIME PARTNER

00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:12,078
FROM THE LAST BUSINESS
THAT WE WERE IN.

00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:13,146
WHAT WAS THE LAST BUSINESS?

00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,048
THE LAST BUSINESS
WAS A HANDBAG BUSINESS.

00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,216
AND WAS THE NAME
OF THE HANDBAG BUSINESS?
WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT ONE?

00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:17,450
THE NAME OF THE HANDBAG BUSINESS
IS ROSETTI.

00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,020
WE SOLD IT FOR $162 MILLION.

00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,988
WOW.
GOOD FOR YOU.
CONGRATULATIONS.

00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,490
Hersh:
IT WASN'T ME THAT DID IT.

00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,125
DID YOU GET
ANY OF THE $162 MILLION?

00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,326
NO, NO, NO.
OH!

00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,361
I'M HUNGRY TO GET IT WITH THIS.

00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,096
Herjavec:
SO, YOU WORKED THERE,

00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:31,331
BUT YOU WEREN'T AN OWNER
OF ROSETTI?

00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,967
NO, MY FATHER WAS THE OWNER
OF ROSETTI, HIM AND --

00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:35,135
HE DIDN'T THROW YOU A BONE?

00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:37,170
YOU KNOW WHAT? MY FATHER DOESN'T
BELIEVE IN DOING THAT.

00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,205
WHAT CAN I SAY?
I LOVE HIM!

00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:39,206
Greiner: NEITHER DO YOU.
I LOVE THE GUY.

00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:40,207
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:43,076
HOW MUCH DOES
THE PINK BAG COST,

00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,377
AND WHAT
DO YOU MAKE IT FOR?

00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:48,114
OKAY, $62 TO LAND IT
IN THE UNITED STATES.

00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,216
SOUNDS LIKE A LOT.
John: THAT'S A LOT.
BUT GO AHEAD.

00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:51,451
AND WHAT
DO YOU SELL IT FOR?

00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:55,055
YEAH. SO, WE SELL IT
WHOLESALE FOR $124.

00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:56,256
MM-HMM.

00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:58,158
AND IT RETAILS FOR $269.

00:05:58,158 --> 00:05:59,426
THAT'S FOR THE LARGEST SIZE.

00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:01,261
AND WHO
ARE YOU SELLING TO?
John: RIGHT.

00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:04,130
SO, THIS WAS THE BLESSING
AND THE CURSE WITH BIAGGI.

00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,299
SO, WHEN WE FIRST
STARTED BIAGGI,

00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:09,035
BEFORE WE EVEN BROUGHT A PIECE
OF LUGGAGE INTO THIS COUNTRY,

00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,404
WE GOT AN ORDER FROM
A LARGER DEPARTMENT STORE

00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:15,375
TO PUT US INTO 100 STORES
WITH 2 OF OUR LINES.

00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,178
IT WAS -- WE WERE REALLY
EXCITED, OBVIOUSLY.

00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:20,213
AND --
SO AM I.
THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,249
YEAH. THERE WAS A MAJOR ISSUE
THAT HAD TO BE FIGURED OUT,

00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:24,150
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE TODAY
TALKING TO YOU.

00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,320
BUT CONSUMER EDUCATION
ON THE FLOOR.

00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,388
SO, EVEN THE SALES PEOPLE

00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,257
DIDN'T KNOW
THAT IT COLLAPSED, RIGHT?

00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:32,259
I WENT INTO ONE STORE.
LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:33,293
WE HAVE --

00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:36,096
BUT WAIT.
IT GETS WORSE.

00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,063
THIS IS THE STORAGE BAG.

00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,098
WHEN YOU FOLD THIS LUGGAGE,

00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:40,000
IT COMES IN A STORAGE BAG
LIKE THIS.

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,270
SO, I GO TO ONE STORE, AND ALL
I SEE ON THE FLOOR ARE THESE.

00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,038
Greiner: OH, NO.
THAT'S IT.
[ LAUGHS ]

00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:46,039
OH, NO, NO, NO.

00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,207
THAT'S IT.
John: ABSOLUTELY.

00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:49,109
YOU'RE LUCKY THEY EVEN
BROUGHT IT OUT OF THE BACK.

00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:52,212
Cuban: STEPHEN, I LOVE THE FACT
THAT YOU'RE HONEST

00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:53,980
AND JUST STRAIGHT UP
TO THE POINT, RIGHT?
RIGHT.

00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,016
BUT WHAT
I'M REALLY HEARING IS,

00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:59,386
NOW YOU'RE JUST IN THE LUGGAGE
GAME WITH ONE EXTRA FEATURE.

00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:02,022
IT IS WHAT IT IS,

00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:03,490
BUT IT'S NOT A BUSINESS
I WANT TO BE IN.

00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,091
I'M OUT.

00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,028
OKAY, I ACCEPT THAT.

00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,262
AND THANK YOU FOR LISTENING
TO ME ANYWAYS.

00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,064
Herjavec: STEPHEN --
I APPRECIATE IT.

00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:13,066
FUNDAMENTALLY, HERE'S
WHAT I HEARD YOU SAY.

00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:14,067
"I HAVE A PRODUCT

00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:16,036
THAT THE CONSUMER
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND."

00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:18,138
THAT'S A BIG CHALLENGE.

00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:21,241
AND THERE IS A LOT
OF COMPETITION.

00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:23,443
I DON'T SEE IT.
I'M OUT.

00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:27,280
TOTALLY ACCEPT THAT, ROBERT,

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,216
AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU
LISTENING TO ME.

00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:33,320
SO, STEPHEN,
THIS IS A TOUGH BUSINESS.

00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,355
IT REQUIRES
THE DEMONSTRATION,

OR AN INFOMERCIAL.

ABOUT THE STRATEGY.

UNLESS YOU HAVE
YOUR OWN TYPE OF STORE,

00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:50,337
IT'S REALLY THE JCPENNEYs
AND THE DILLARDs

00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:51,371
AND THE BURLINGTONs.

00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:54,074
THEY HAVE HUNDREDS
OF FEETS OF LUGGAGE,

00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:56,142
AND IT'S VERY HARD
TO DIFFERENTIATE.

00:07:56,142 --> 00:08:00,380
BUT I ACTUALLY JUST DID A DEAL
WITH HSN FOR LUGGAGE.

00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,449
SO, I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER.

00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:09,222

THAT'S A TERRIFIC OFFER, AND I
REALLY APPRECIATE THAT, DAMON,

WANT TO --

00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,128

THE OFFER NOW OR NOT?

A-ARE YOU GIVING ME AN ULTIMATUM

00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,365

ON THE SPOT?

00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,200

AN ULTIMATUM.

DIFFERENT FUNCTION.

most interested,

00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,120
THAT SUFFER FROM RAZOR BURN
AND HAIR BUMPS,

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,122
ALSO KNOWN AS FOLLICULITIS.

00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:24,424
FOLLICULITIS IS WHEN THE HAIR

00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,059
GETS TRAPPED
BENEATH THE HAIR FOLLICLE,

00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:29,195
BEGINS TO BREED BACTERIA...
EW.

00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:31,364
...AND CAUSES THE SKIN
TO BECOME ITCHY AND IRRITATED.

00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:33,232
IT'S REALLY, REALLY NASTY STUFF.

00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:37,403
SO, I STARTED JOTTING DOWN
FORMULATIONS, AND VOILà,

00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:39,005
THE S.W.A.G. BAR WAS BORN.

00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:43,976
THE S.W.A.G. BARS WENT ON SALE,
AND IT WAS ON.

00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:45,411
NOW WHEN THE GUYS
SEE ME AROUND TOWN,

00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:50,016
ALL I HEAR IS, "HEY, SOAP LADY!
YOU GOT THE GOODS WITH YOU?"

00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:52,318
"WELL, OF COURSE, I DO.
MEET ME AROUND BACK."

00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:55,221
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:58,191
THE S.W.A.G. BAR
HAS A THREE-IN-ONE VERSATILITY

00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:01,327
THAT ALLOWS A GUY TO CLEANSE,
EXFOLIATE, AND DISINFECT

00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:04,130
THE SURFACE OF HIS SKIN
IN ONE EASY USE.

00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:08,000
WITH YOUR HELP, THIS BAR
IS GONNA TAKE OFF LIKE A G5.

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,236
WHO'S GONNA FLY AIR S.W.A.G.
WITH ME?

00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:13,039
BECAUSE TOGETHER,
WE'RE GONNA CLEAN UP.

00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,407

SO, THE LOOFAH'S IN HERE?

00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:37,063
THE LOOFAH'S IN THERE.

00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:38,130
WHAT'S LOOFAH?

00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,299
IT'S A FORM OF SPONGE,
RIGHT?

00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:41,367
IT'S CATEGORIZED AS A SPONGE.

00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,002
O'Leary:
IT'S ACTUALLY A PLANT

00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,238
FIRST USED BY THE ANCIENT ROMANS
IN THEIR BATHS...

00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:46,272
OH, MY GOD.
YES.

00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:47,273
...TO EXFOLIATE.

YES?

00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:49,942
I'M NOT 1,000 YEARS OLD
LIKE KEVIN.
YES.

00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,011
SO, I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT LOOFAH IS.

00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,145
BUT WHAT ELSE IS IN HERE?

00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,248
'CAUSE I SEE ALL KINDS
OF THINGS IN THE SOAP.

00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:57,116
THERE'S -- WELL,
IT'S A PROPRIETARY PRODUCT,

00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,451
SO I CAN'T DISCLOSE THAT TO YOU.

00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:00,119
YOU TOOK THE LOOFAH
AND POURED THAT IN?
HAVE YOU PATENTED THAT?

00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,187
I HAVE NOT PATENTED.

00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,022
AND LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU
WHY I HAVE NOT PATENTED.

00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,191
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO RELEASE
MY INGREDIENTS.

00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,193
IT'S 63 DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS
THAT GO INTO THAT BAR.

00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:10,029
63 THINGS IN HERE?
YES, SIR.
63 INGREDIENTS.

00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,163
AND IT'S ALL NATURAL.

00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:12,331
DO YOU HAVE
ANY SALES, LYDIA?

00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:16,002
YES, SIR.
WE'RE LOOKING AT $54,500.

00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:17,370
AND HOW HAVE YOU
SOLD THAT?

00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,171
THROUGH MY BROTHER'S
BARBERSHOP AND THE WEBSITE.

00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:21,173
HOW MUCH ON THE WEB?
HOW MUCH IN THE BARBER SHOP?

00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:24,377
I WOULD SAY 75% WEB,
25% BARBERSHOP.

00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,979
AND DO YOU MAKE THIS
FOR WOMEN?

00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,115
I AM LOOKING INTO THAT BECAUSE
A LOT OF GUYS ARE SAYING

00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:30,416
THAT THEIR GIRLFRIENDS
ARE USING IT

00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,318
ON THEIR LEGS AND BIKINI AREAS,

00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:34,120

FOR THAT.

THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,369

THAT I NEED
TO GET INTO A WAREHOUSE

00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,324
AND PRODUCE ON A LARGER LEVEL.

TIME CONSUMING.
YES.

FOR YOU.

00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,197

WHAT A LOOFAH WAS.

00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,075
VERY INNOVATIVE.

00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,343
IT WILL BE THE VERY FIRST ONE
IN THE WORLD

00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:06,178
TO COME TO THE MARKET
THE WAY IT IS.

00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,080
O'Leary: ALL RIGHT. I THINK
IT'S A VERY INNOVATIVE IDEA,

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,417
BUT REALLY A HOBBY AT THIS POINT
ON YOUR KITCHEN TABLE.

IF YOU ALREADY SET UP
MANUFACTURING,

00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:18,057
YOU WERE TRYING TO POUR GASOLINE
ON THAT TO ACCELERATE IT,

00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:19,191
THAT WOULD BE
MORE INTERESTING.

00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:21,227

YOU'RE GONNA FACE.

00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:23,162

UM, IT HAS GOTTEN
OUTSIDE OF HOUSTON

JUST SEEM TO ME

TO SAY, "LOOK.

00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:59,065

AND SAY, "LOOK.

OF HELP TO YOU.

TO GO TO THE BIG GAME.

00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,998
AND I LOOK OVER AT THIS GUY,

00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,234
AND HE WAS DECKED OUT
FROM HEAD TO TOE.

00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:17,269
BUT I GO TO MY CLOSET,
AND I WAS LEFT

00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,972
WITH EITHER
AN OVER-SIZED JERSEY

00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:21,307
OR A LIGHT PINK T-SHIRT.

00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:22,975
I THOUGHT, "REALLY?
COME ON.

00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:24,176
WE CAN DO BETTER
THAN THAT."

00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,045
AND GAMEDAY COUTURE
WAS BORN.

00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:27,146
[ WHISTLE BLOWS ]

00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:29,181
WE TAKE WHAT'S TRENDING
IN THE FASHION WORLD

00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,250
AND BRING IT TO THE FEMALE
SPORTS FAN MARKET.

00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,053
HIGH-QUALITY FABRICS
AT COMPETITIVE PRICE POINTS.

00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:36,222
AND GAMEDAY GIVES WOMEN
THE OPPORTUNITY

00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:38,190
TO LOOK COMFORTABLE
YET STYLISH

00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,193
OR DECKED OUT
FROM HEAD TO TOE.

00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,361
SO, WE'RE A SUCCESS
IN THE SOUTH,

00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,097
BUT WE WANT TO DRESS FANS
FROM ALL OVER.

00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:46,465
WHO WANTS
TO JOIN TEAM GAMEDAY

00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:49,268
AND MAKE A STATEMENT
WITH FAN FASHION?

00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:51,337
OUR MODELS ARE GONNA
PASS OUT SOME SAMPLES

00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:52,438
FOR YOU GUYS RIGHT NOW.

00:22:52,438 --> 00:22:54,006
Herjavec: THANK YOU.

00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:55,241
IT'S ALL FOR FEMALES,
OBVIOUSLY, RIGHT?

00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:57,142
CURRENTLY, YES.
WE FOCUS ON THE FEMALE MARKET.

00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:58,978
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES SO FAR?

00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:01,247
WE DID ABOUT $750,000
IN SALES LAST YEAR.

00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:03,182
THIS YEAR,
WE'VE DONE ABOUT $1 MILLION.

00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:06,285
WE'RE ON PACE
TO BE ABOUT $1.5 MILLION.

00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:08,087
Herjavec: GREAT GROWTH.
IMPRESSIVE.

00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:10,422
SO, I DID AN INVESTMENT
LAST SEASON, UH, TIP SALES.

00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:12,191
THAT'S RIGHT.
AND THEY MAKE
THE UGLY CHRISTMAS SWEATERS.

00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:14,326
WE'RE KILLING IT.
WE'LL DO $4 MILLION THIS YEAR.

00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:15,394
RIGHT.

00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,428
WE'RE NOW EXPANDING
INTO THE COLLEGE MARKET.

00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:18,097
Kurt: MM-HMM.
OKAY.

00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:20,199
AND WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS,
IT'S VERY, VERY EXPENSIVE

00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:22,001
TO BUY THE LICENSES
FROM EACH COLLEGE.
EXPENSIVE.

00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:24,303
YEAH.
Herjavec: HOW MANY
COLLEGES, UNIVERSITIES

00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:26,438
DO YOU HAVE LICENSES FOR
ACROSS THE STATES?

00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:29,341
AS WE STAND RIGHT NOW,
WE HAVE ABOUT 37 LICENSES.

00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:31,410
WE'VE GOT A FEW MORE
ON THE WAY.

00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,045
O'Leary: TELL ME
THE AVERAGE PRICE POINT.

00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:35,281
AVERAGE PRICE POINT'S $22,
WHOLESALE.

00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:36,348
AVERAGE RETAIL'S $44.

00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:38,284
WHAT DOES IT COST FOR YOU
TO MAKE IT?

00:23:38,284 --> 00:23:39,385
ABOUT $8.

00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:41,320
Greiner: RECENTLY, I WENT
TO A BLACKHAWKS GAME.

00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,354
MY HUSBAND SAID, "YOU KNOW,

00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:44,256
"IT'D BE GREAT
IF WE WORE SOMETHING,

00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,324
THE COLORS, ET CETERA."

00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:46,392
WE'RE ONLINE.

00:23:46,392 --> 00:23:47,459
WE'RE LOOKING
AT ALL THE DIFFERENT SHIRTS.

00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:49,061
I DIDN'T LIKE ANYTHING

00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:51,096
UNTIL I CAME TO ONE
THAT WAS LIKE YOURS...

00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,231
MM-HMM.
...THAT WAS BLINGY.

00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:53,465
SO, THAT'S WHAT I BOUGHT.

00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:56,201
MY POINT IS THAT
YOUR PRICE POINT'S GOOD.

00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:57,369
THANK YOU.

00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:00,172
BECAUSE I THINK THAT MINE
COST LIKE $60-SOME-ODD.

00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:01,974
AND THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE.

00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:03,342
WE REALLY WORKED HARD
WITH A LOT OF OUR RETAILERS

00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:05,377
AND THE UNIVERSITIES
DIRECTLY TO DEVELOP --

00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:07,179
WHAT WE ARE KNOWN FOR
IS AN ALUMNI CUT

00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:09,048
AT A COMPETITIVE
PRICE POINT.

00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:12,017
HOW MUCH MONEY
WILL YOU MAKE THIS YEAR?

00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:13,452
ABOUT $100,000
OUT OF $1.5 MILLION.

00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,154
OKAY.
SO, IT'S NOT A LOT.

00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:17,089
WHY ARE YOU WORTH $2.5 MILLION?

00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:20,059
WE'RE WORTH $2.5 MILLION

00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:22,127
BECAUSE WE HAVE PUT
ALL THE MONEY BACK IN

00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,129
TO APPLYING
THE ADDITIONAL LICENSES,

00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,431
SEEKING OUT THE MARKETS.

00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:29,034
SO, LAST YEAR,
WHEN WE DID $750,000,

00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:30,169
THAT WAS BASICALLY SHIPPED
ON JUST 10 SCHOOLS.

00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:31,303
THAT'S CORRECT.

00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,439
SO, LIKE, RIGHT NOW,
WE HAVE ABOUT 37 SCHOOLS.

00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:35,240
OKAY. I GET THAT.
Herjavec: WOW.

00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,976
SO, YOU'VE BUILT A PLATFORM

00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:40,346
UPON WHICH ONE DAY, WITH
SUCCESS, YOU'LL MAKE MONEY.

00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:42,247
RIGHT.
BUT I DON'T THINK
IT'S WORTH $2.5 MILLION.

00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:44,116
THE LICENSES ARE VALUABLE.
YOU'VE GOT THEM.

00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:46,285
THAT'S CORRECT.
RELATIONSHIPS ARE VALUABLE.
YOU'VE GOT THEM.

00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:47,419
THAT'S CORRECT.
THEN I ASK MYSELF,

00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:50,289
"WHAT WOULD IT COST ME
TO GO CATCH UP WITH YOU?"

00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:52,024
THERE'S NOTHING STOPPING ME

00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:53,993
IF I WANTED TO GET
INTO THIS BUSINESS.

00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,395
I'M THINKING PROBABLY
IF I FUNDED $750,000,

00:24:56,395 --> 00:24:58,130
I'D GET A TEAM LIKE YOU

00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:01,300
AND I JUST RUN LIKE HELL
AND GET THOSE LICENSES, TOO.

00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,102
YOU COULD GO OUT AND SPEND
A BUNCH OF MONEY ON IT,

00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:04,169
BUT WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO?

00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,404
I'VE ALREADY JUMPED
OVER ALL THE HURDLES,

00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:07,272
AND I'M STILL SPRINTING.
WELL, I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT --

00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:09,141
YOU DON'T MAKE ANY MONEY,
SO I --
WE'VE ALREADY DONE
ALL THE HARD WORK.

00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:10,142
YOU DON'T MAKE ANY CASH FLOW.
I UNDERSTAND.

00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:12,077
THE KEY TO BUSINESS
IS TO FIGURE OUT

00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:13,979
WHAT THE RIGHT PRICE
TO BUY IN IS.

00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:14,413
SURE. SURE.

00:25:14,413 --> 00:25:16,215
BECAUSE IF YOU OVERPAY,

00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:18,050
YOU DIE OF OLD AGE
BEFORE YOU GET YOUR MONEY BACK.

00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,451
I DON'T LIKE THAT.

00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,255
I THINK YOU OVER-PRICED
YOUR BUSINESS.

00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:26,158
I THINK YOU'RE WORTH
ABOUT $750,000.

00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:30,062
I'D HAVE TO OWN, YOU KNOW,
75% OF YOU AT THIS PRICE.

00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:31,163
I'M OUT.

00:25:31,163 --> 00:25:33,265
AND I'LL LET SOMEONE ELSE
TRY AND FIGURE IT OUT.

00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,169
SO, THE NBA CALLED ME,
AND THEY SAID, "HEY.

00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:39,972
"WE WANT TO GIVE YOU A LICENSE
BECAUSE WE WANT YOU

00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:42,374
TO MAKE FASHIONABLE STUFF
FOR ON-COURT AND OFF-COURT."

00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:48,080
SO, I MADE THESE GREAT KNICKS
AND BULLS VELOUR SUITS.

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,184
AND WHAT HAPPENED IS,
THE KID JUST WANTED

00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:54,420
THE $40 JERSEY WITH
HIS FAVORITE PLAYER ON IT.

00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,988
THAT'S ALL HE WANTED.

00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:57,022
SO, I ENDED UP HAVING

00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:58,057
ABOUT $10 MILLION
IN INVENTORY THAT...

00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:00,025
[ WHISTLES ]
...WAS PRETTY CHALLENGING.

00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:02,227
I'M STILL LICKING
MY WOUNDS A LITTLE.

00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,296
SORRY. I-I'M OUT.

00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:08,067
THIS WOULD BE A REALLY GREAT
PIECE FOR YOUR PORTFOLIO.

00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,134
I JUST DON'T WANT TO GO
BACK DOWN THAT ROAD AGAIN.

00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:10,235
YOU DON'T WANT
TO GO OUT ON THIS.

00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,004
I'M STILL NOT THROUGH
MY CURRENT INVENTORY.

00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:13,138
DAMON, I SEE
SOME GROVELING GOING ON.

00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,074
CAN YOU TELL THEM
WHAT IT'S WORTH?

00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:17,142
$1.5 MILLION.

00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:18,177
HE'S VERY GENEROUS.

00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:20,212
YOU'RE ONLY $1 MILLION
OVER VALUED.

00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:23,282
THAT MEANS ROBERT CAN STEP UP
AND MAYBE DO SOMETHING.

00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:27,286
YOU KNOW, IT'S $500,000.
RIGHT?

00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:29,054
IT'S NOT AN INSIGNIFICANT
AMOUNT OF MONEY.

00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:30,289
NO, IT'S NOT.

00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:33,192
SO, VALUATION MATTERS, ROB?
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:35,027
PLEASE.
DON'T YOU HAVE THE VISION?

00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:36,195
BUT EVERYTHING YOU'RE DOING

00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:38,330
IS EXACTLY WHAT I WOULD HAVE
TOLD YOU TO DO.
SURE.

00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,332
I WOULD SIMPLY RUN
A LITTLE BIT FASTER.

00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:42,267
YOU KNOW, DAMON THINKS
IT'S WORTH $1.5 MILLION.

00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,136
I HAVE TO BE HONEST.

00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:46,205
I SAW IT BEING WORTH
AROUND $1 MILLION...

00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:48,040
OKAY.
Herjavec: ...FOR THE RISK.

00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,008
AND I'M NOT TRYING TO BE
DISRESPECTFUL TO YOU.

00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:51,343
YOU'RE NOT DISRESPECTFUL.
IT'S UNDERSTANDING

00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:53,212
KIND OF WHERE WE'RE AT
WITHIN OUR INDUSTRY.

00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:54,980
IT IS WORTH A WHOLE LOT MORE

00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,215
THAN WE'VE EVEN PROBABLY
GIVEN IT CREDIT FOR.

00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:58,117
OF COURSE IT IS.
BECAUSE WE'VE SCRATCHED
THE SURFACE.

00:26:58,117 --> 00:26:59,218
YOU KNOW, SHAWNNA,
FOR ME, TODAY,

00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:01,253
IT'S WORTH
THAT DOLLAR AMOUNT...

00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:03,222
TOTALLY.
I RESPECT THAT.
...AS AN INVESTOR.

00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:04,256
AND YOU'RE NOT
GONNA TAKE THAT.

00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:06,091
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT
GONNA TAKE THAT.

00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:07,993
FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.

00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:09,261
APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH.

00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:11,063
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:15,033
LORI OR MARK,
ANY OF YOU GUYS INTERESTED?

00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:17,035
WHAT -- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING ONLINE?

00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:19,304
WE JUST LAUNCHED ONLINE
LAST YEAR, RETAIL,

00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,173
BECAUSE WE WANTED TO FOCUS ON
OUR WHOLESALE BASE

00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:22,207
AND GET THAT BUILT FIRST

00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,076
BEFORE WE JUST BRANCHED
INTO TOO MANY THINGS.

00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:26,445
BUT, GUYS, MOST OF YOUR BUSINESS
SHOULD BE ONLINE, RIGHT?

00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:28,380
'CAUSE I WOULD THINK ANY ALUM,

00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,349
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
THEY'RE GONNA GET TO YOU.
CORRECT.

00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:32,251
AND MOST OF OUR RETAILERS
SELL ONLINE.
AND THERE'S
A HUGE OPPORTUNITY.

00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:35,387
LOOK. I'M KIND OF SURPRISED
YOU DIDN'T GO THAT WAY SOONER

00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,055
BECAUSE IT'S MORE OF A PATH
OF LEAST RESISTANCE.

00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:38,056
SURE. SURE.
RIGHT?

00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:39,324
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
I'M MISSING

00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,360
IN TERMS OF WHY
YOU DIDN'T GO ONLINE?

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,029
BASICALLY, YOU KNOW, WHEN
WE GO OBTAIN THESE LICENSES,

00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:45,430
WE WORK WITH THESE
LICENSING DIRECTORS.

00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,399
AND THEY WANT TO SEE US DO
SOMETHING WITH THE LICENSE.

00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,001
IS THERE A LIMIT?

00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,135
ARE YOU NOT ALLOWED
TO SELL ONLINE WITH YOUR --?

00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:51,436
NO, YOU ARE. WE ARE.
YEAH, WE ARE. WE ARE.

00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,338
BUT THEY REALLY WANT
TO SEE YOU TAKE THE LICENSE

00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,307
AND DO SOMETHING WITH IT
WITHIN THE FIRST --

00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:56,408
John: OKAY.
ONE SECOND.

00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:59,278
IT'S VERY HARD TO SHOW
A LICENSING ORGANIZATION

00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:01,046
A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
ON THE INTERNET SAYING,

00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:02,247
"I'M INTERESTED."
THAT'S EXACTLY CORRECT.

00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:06,018
BUT IT IS REALLY EASY TO SHOW
THEM ORDERS FROM 50 STORES

00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,286
SAYING,
"THIS IS AN OFFICIAL ORDER."

00:28:07,286 --> 00:28:09,354
DID THAT HAPPEN?
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:12,124
OKAY.
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU AN OFFER.

00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:13,292

WHO WEREN'T AROUND
WHEN THIS HAPPENED,

00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:33,392
COPA DI VINO WAS ANOTHER
SINGLE-SERVE WINE DEAL

00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,327
THAT CAME IN THE TANK TWICE.

00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:39,331
BOTH TIMES, GOT OFFERS, AND HE
NEVER ACCEPTED EITHER OF THEM.

00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:42,100
Herjavec: ANDREW, WHY IS IT
DIFFERENT THAN COPA DI VINO?

00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:46,037
IT'S DIFFERENT IN THAT
WE OWN THE PATENTS AND --

00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:47,172
O'Leary:
COPA DI VINO ASSURED US

00:31:47,172 --> 00:31:51,042
THEY HAD A PATENT ON SEALING
A GLASS OF WINE THIS WAY.

00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:53,412
SO --
SO, HOW HAVE YOU NOT
BREACHED THAT PATENT?

00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:57,315
ACTUALLY, THE COMPANY THAT OWNS
THE RIGHTS TO THAT GLASS

00:31:57,315 --> 00:32:00,218
AND TO THAT TECHNOLOGY IS
A COMPANY BASED OUT OF FRANCE.

00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:02,320
IN SPEAKING WITH THE OWNER
OF THE COMPANY,

00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,423
HE TOLD US THAT
THE PREVIOUS ENTREPRENEUR,

00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:06,224
ESSENTIALLY, HE'S A --
LIKE A FRANCHISEE.

00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:10,262
SO, HE HAD THE RIGHTS TO USE
HIS TECHNOLOGY FOR HIS GLASS.

00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:13,131
SO, WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN YOUR TWO PATENTS?

00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:14,199

CASES A YEAR IN THE U.S. MARKET.

00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:34,453
SO, WHAT I'M TRYING
TO CLARIFY WITH CERTAINTY --

00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,455
BECAUSE BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD
A LONG TIME AGO.

00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:39,191

BETTER THAN THE OTHER GUY

00:32:39,191 --> 00:32:41,293

00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,029
THE POINT IS,
YOU'RE TELLING ME,

00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:46,264
AFTER HAVING VISITED
THE OWNER OF THE PATENT,

00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:47,466
THAT THERE IS NO BREACH?

00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:50,402
THEY HAVE AGREED THAT YOU DO
NOT INFRINGE ON THEIR PATENT?

00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:52,103
THAT IS 100% CORRECT.

00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:55,173
IS YOUR PATENT UNIQUE
NOT ONLY TO THE FORM FACTOR

00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:58,076
BUT ALSO TO COAT THE GLASS
WITH THAT PLASTIC?

00:32:58,076 --> 00:32:59,344
CORRECT.

00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:02,347
THE MIX OF THE PLASTIC THAT'S
IN HERE IS PROPRIETARY TO US.

00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:05,183

ALONG WITH
THE EXTERIOR PACKAGE?

00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:07,085
ALONG WITH THE EXTERIOR PACKAGE.
SO THOSE TWO THINGS --

00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:08,420
THAT'S ALSO A PART OF THE PATENT
IS THE U.V. WRAP,

SO, THOSE TWO THINGS --
OKAY.

00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:12,224
OKAY, LET'S PUT THE PATENT ASIDE
FOR A MOMENT.

00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:13,291

WITH FETZER WINERY.

00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,287

00:33:50,996 --> 00:33:54,132
THEY TOOK YOUR TECHNOLOGY
AND PUT THEIR WINE INTO IT

00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:55,967

BUT THE QUESTION BECOMES,

00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:21,393
IF YOU HAVE
ALL THOSE TEAM OWNERS,

00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,261
THEN WHY ARE YOU ASKING US
FOR THE MONEY?

00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:25,997
I WANT ALL FIVE OF YOU GUYS
AT THE TABLE WITH ME.

00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:27,999
WHAT'S IT SELL FOR?
WHAT'S YOUR TOTAL SALES?

00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:30,001
THE ZIPZ BRAND THAT YOU'RE
HOLDING IN YOUR GLASS RIGHT NOW,

00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:32,437
WE'VE CURRENTLY DONE
ABOUT $650,000 IN SALES.

00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:36,041
WHAT DOES IT COST AT RETAIL,
A GLASS OF ZIPZ?

00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:38,276
$2.99 PER GLASS.
O'Leary: LOOK.

00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:40,412
VERY FEW PEOPLE WILL BUY
A GLASS OF WINE FOR 3 BUCKS.

00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:43,181
WE'RE ALREADY IN 1,200 STORES.
WE JUST GOT WALMART THIS WEEK.

00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:44,416
WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE?

00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,084
IT COSTS ME 95 CENTS.

00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,320
OOH. LOOK.

00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,356
IN AMERICA, 97% OF WINE

00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:54,993
IS SOLD FOR UNDER
$9.95 A BOTTLE.

00:34:54,993 --> 00:34:58,096
SO, WHERE THIS PACKAGING IDEA
HAS SO MUCH MERIT

00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,199
IN TERMS OF ITS DELIVERY,
IT FAILS ON ITS PRICING.

00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:04,169
WHEN THE AVERAGE CONSUMER
SAYS TO HIMSELF,

00:35:04,169 --> 00:35:06,438
"I CAN GET 5 1/2 GLASSES
FOR $9.99,

00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:09,007
AND I HAVE TO PAY $3.99
FOR ONE,"

00:35:09,007 --> 00:35:10,275
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:13,345
YEAH, BUT THIS IS, YOU KNOW --
BUT THE -- YOU CAN'T DISMISS --

00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:15,013
LIKE YOU SAID,
YOU CAN'T DISMISS THE PACKAGE.

00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:16,214
BUT YOU'VE ONLY GOT $650,000
IN SALES, MY FRIEND.

00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:19,150
THAT'S NOTHING
IN THE WINE BUSINESS.

00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,119

AT THE $2.99 PRICE POINT.

00:35:22,387 --> 00:35:24,155

THROUGH ANY.
THAT'S THE TIPPING POINT.

00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:25,190
LIKE YOU SAID --
THEY HAVEN'T
TESTED THE MARKET.

00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,191

I'M NOT A WINE CONNOISSEUR.

FROM A QUALITY PERSPECTIVE

00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:51,082

A ZIPPER NAMED ZIPZ.

00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:54,019

LET ME TELL YOU
A VERY BRIEF STORY

00:35:57,022 --> 00:35:58,189
THAT I THINK
WILL BE SOBERING FOR YOU.

00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:01,426
I WENT TO SEE COSTCO
AND TALK TO THEM ABOUT WINE.

00:36:01,426 --> 00:36:03,061
THEY'RE THE LARGEST BUYER
OF WINE ON EARTH.

00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:06,031
SURE.
$5.2 BILLION IN WINE.

00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:07,465
I SAID, "I'M GOING
INTO THE WINE BUSINESS."

00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:08,466
THEY SAID, "WHO CARES?"

00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:10,168
THERE'S 5,000 APPLICATIONS
A YEAR

00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,270
TO PUT WINE FROM ALL AROUND
THE WORLD INTO COSTCO.

00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:16,007
"GO PROVE THAT O'LEARY MEANS
SOMETHING IN THE WINE BUSINESS."

00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,977
IT TOOK ME TWO YEARS TO DO IT.

00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:21,046
I GO BACK TO COSTCO.

00:36:21,046 --> 00:36:23,214
AND SHE SAYS, "IMPRESSIVE.

00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:26,184
BUT NOW YOU HAVE TO DEAL
WITH A NEW PRICE POINT."

00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,053

750 MILLILITER BOTTLES.

00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:33,191
DID YOU GET YOUR WINE
INTO COSTCO?

00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,293
I'M NEGOTIATING IT RIGHT NOW.
IT'S NOT IN YET.

00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:36,294

00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:37,462
John: THAT WOULD BE
A NO. OKAY.

00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:39,330

GONNA BE THIS YEAR?

00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:40,999
WE -- I DON'T WANT TO LOOK AT IT
AS A LOSS.

00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:42,200
I WANT TO LOOK AT IT
AS A REINVESTMENT BACK.

00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:47,205
WHY NOT SIMPLY LICENSE
TO THE BIG MANUFACTURERS,

00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,008
TO THE BIG WINERIES,
AND LET THEM TAKE ALL OF THAT?

00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:52,977

ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL.

00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:54,379
THAT'S NOT THE PURPOSE
OF A LICENSING DEAL.

00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:57,148
WHY DO ANY OF IT?

00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:59,451
WELL, I MEAN,
HINDSIGHT IS ALWAYS 20/20.

00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:01,052
THAT'S THE ANSWER?

00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,287

NO!

00:37:02,287 --> 00:37:04,022
NOW HE'S TOO FAR IN.
HE'S GOT NO CHOICE.

00:37:04,022 --> 00:37:08,460

THAT YOU WANT TO SELL IT AT,

OUR CONVERSATION TODAY,

IS A FACT.

YOU'RE GONNA GO FIND THIS OUT
ON YOUR OWN.

00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:38,389
John: MY GUT FEELING IS,
I WOULD NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE

00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:40,425

WITH THIS AMOUNT OF RISK.

00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:42,026

TO CLEAR THE AIR IN THAT SENSE,
I MEAN, WE'RE NOT A COPY CAT.

00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:58,443
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS

THAT THERE'S A GREAT USE FOR IT
IN CERTAIN APPLICATIONS.

00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:10,155
BUT ALL THE REST OF THIS
IS SO COMPLICATED --

00:38:10,155 --> 00:38:12,357

SEE MY WAY THROUGH THIS.
