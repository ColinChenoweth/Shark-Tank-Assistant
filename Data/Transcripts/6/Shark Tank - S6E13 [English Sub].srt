00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:08,088
ALL RIGHT, FROM
THE MILLION DOLLARS IN SALES,

00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:10,123
WHAT WILL YOU MAKE?
WHAT'S YOUR PROFIT?

00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:12,292
SO, RIGHT NOW,
OUR PROFIT IS NEGATIVE

00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:15,128
BECAUSE WE HAD TO SPEND
A LOT OF MONEY,

00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:16,463
MOSTLY ON SALARIES,
TO PAY OUR DEVELOPERS.

00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:19,399
AND DO YOU GUYS TAKE A SALARY
TODAY?

00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:23,169
RIGHT NOW
WE TAKE $100,000 SALARY EACH.
EACH?

00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,305
WOW.
SORRY.
YOU TAKE $100,000 EACH?

00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:28,008
SO $300,000 YOU'RE DRAWING OUT
OF THE BUSINESS RIGHT NOW.

00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,210
Soo: A YEAR.
Arum: A YEAR.

00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,079
BUT THAT IS STILL A SIGNIFICANT
PAY CUT FOR ALL OF US,

00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,248
WHATEVER
WE WERE MAKING PRIOR.
Herjavec: [ LAUGHS ]

00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:39,219
WE ACTUALLY RAISED $2.8 MILLION
IN EXTERNAL FUNDING SO FAR.

00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:40,487
WOW.
HOW?

00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:42,455
OUR NOTABLE INVESTOR, ACTUALLY,
IS ONE OF THE CO-FOUNDERS

00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:45,291
OF Match.com,
WHO ABSOLUTELY LOVED OUR IDEA.

00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,360
AND HE WAS
OUR VERY FIRST INVESTOR.

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,462
ON THE $1 MILLION, HOW MUCH
WILL YOU LOSE THIS YEAR?

00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,331
WE'LL LOSE $1 MILLION.

00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:54,300
YOU'LL LOSE $1 MILLION ON
$1 MILLION IN SALES THIS YEAR?

00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,103
YES. WHICH IS WHY WE ACTUALLY
HAVE TO RAISE MORE MONEY

00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,172
BECAUSE WE ARE TRYING TO RAMP UP
OUR GROWTH.

00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:02,242
YOU'RE PROJECTING $10 MILLION
FOR THE SECOND YEAR.

00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:05,011
EXACTLY.
HOW MUCH MONEY WILL YOU MAKE
ON THAT $10 MILLION?

00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:07,280
WE WILL BREAK EVEN
ON $10 MILLION.

00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,049
YOU'LL BREAK EVEN
ON $10 MILLION?
WOW.

00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,251
LET HER GO. LET HER GO.
GO AHEAD. TELL US.
Dawoon: HERE'S WHY.

00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:14,287
WE PLAN TO BRING ON
ABOUT 4 MILLION USERS NEXT YEAR,

00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:17,424
WHICH IS GOING TO GENERATE
ABOUT $2.50 EACH,

00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:19,259
HENCE THE $10 MILLION.

00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,461
AND WHAT'S YOUR
CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COST?
30 CENTS.

00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:24,364
NEXT YEAR, WE PLAN ON SPENDING
ABOUT $3 MILLION TO $4 MILLION

00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:27,167
ON MARKETING SPENDING
AND ACQUIRE 4 MILLION USERS.

00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:29,235
SO, WE ARE ASSUMING
A SLIGHT INCREASE

00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,970
IN CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COST.

00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,338
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE AN ALL-OR-NOTHING PLAY.

00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:35,275
WHY DO YOU THINK
WE'RE ALL-OR-NOTHING?

00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:37,077
BECAUSE YOU'RE LOSING
SO MUCH MONEY.

00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:40,046
YOU'RE NOT REALLY IN
THE "BUILDING A BUSINESS" GAME,

00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,415
YOU'RE IN THE "RAISING MONEY
AND GETTING USERS" GAME.

00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,018
I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO HIT
A HOME RUN.

00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:49,222
I'M NOT SAYING YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO, BUT IT'S RISKY.

00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:50,356
I'M OUT.

00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:55,395
IT IS OUR DECISION
TO INVEST MORE NOW

00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:57,297
SO WE CAN ACCELERATE GROWTH,

00:09:57,297 --> 00:10:00,166
BUT WE CAN JUST AS WELL
JUST GROW THIS BUSINESS AS IS.

00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,103
THAT'S THE FASCINATING
DILEMMA, 'CAUSE I HEAR
WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM.

00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,237
THE BASELINE MODEL WORKS.

00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:07,173
YOU WANT TO POUR GASOLINE
ON THAT FIRE.
EXACTLY.

00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:08,308
IT'S A PRETTY BIG BET.

00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:13,346
AND WHILE I'M DOING IT, I PART
WITH $500,000 AND I GET 5%.

00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:18,351
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS FOR ME NOW
ON "SHARK TANK" IN SEASON 6 IS,

00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:21,287
I'VE COME TO REALIZE
I'M REALLY VALUABLE.

00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,989
BIG TIME.
[ CHUCKLES ]

00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:25,992
AND IT'S MADE ME
VERY GREEDY.

00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,294
I DON'T DO 5% DEALS.
THAT'S WORTHLESS TO ME.

00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,197
I WOULDN'T DO THIS.

00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:32,398
I'M OUT.

00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:36,035
IF WE REALLY THOUGHT THIS
WAS ALL-OR-NOTHING,

00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:38,371
WE WOULD HAVE RAISED A LOT
MORE MONEY FROM THE BEGINNING.

00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,073
NOW WE ACTUALLY HAVE A CHOICE

00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:42,075
OF JUST GROWING
THE BUSINESS TRADITIONALLY

00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:44,144
OR RAISE MORE MONEY
TO MAKE THIS BIG.

00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:47,380
YOU'VE RAISED A LOT OF MONEY,
AND YOU'RE NOT MAKING MONEY,

00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:51,017
AND YOU'RE EACH
DRAWING $100,000 --

00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:52,385
THAT'S $300,000
OUT OF THE BUSINESS.

00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,420
THAT SEEMS
VERY HIGH SALARY.

00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,157
I MEAN, MOST PEOPLE DON'T MAKE
ANYWHERE NEAR THAT.

00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,391
AND YOU'RE JUST GROWING.

00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,393
BIG CONCERN I HAVE, ALSO,

00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,429
IS THE FACT THAT SOMEBODY ELSE
COULD DO THIS.

00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:07,000
PEOPLE ARE KNOCKING OFF
EVERYBODY

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,035
ON THE INTERNET
ALL THE TIME.

00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:10,403
SO, FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.

00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:16,042
I THINK ONE THING FOR SURE IS
YOU ARE GREAT AT RAISING MONEY.
THANK YOU.

00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,178
I ALSO THINK
THIS IS A SITE THAT'S NEEDED.

00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,214
I THINK THE WOMEN I KNOW THAT
HAVE BEEN ON THE TYPICAL WEBSITE

00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:23,983
FEEL LIKE A PIECE OF MEAT
IN A MEAT LOCKER.

00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,051
EXACTLY.
TOTALLY.
THEY'RE LOOKED OVER.

00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,486
YOU KNOW,
IT'S ALMOST INSULTING.

00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:30,156
YES.
THIS IS A SITE THAT GIVES WOMEN
A LITTLE BIT MORE CONTROL.

00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,224
AND I LIKE ALL OF THAT.

00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:33,193
BUT I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I DON'T LIKE --

00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,395
THE BREAK EVEN AT $10 MILLION.

00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:37,297
A BREAK EVEN!

00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:39,299
AND I'M ONLY OWNING
5% OF THE STOCK.

00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:40,333
THAT'S SPOOKY.

00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,001
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
ENOUGH UP-SIDE

00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,404
FOR THE ENORMOUS RISK
I'D BE TAKING.

00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:46,439
SO, FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.

00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,374
THANK YOU.

00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,310
LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION.

00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,279
IF I OFFERED YOU $30 MILLION
FOR THE COMPANY,
WOULD YOU TAKE IT?

00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:10,063
Narrator:
ALL FIVE SHARKS ARE OUT,

00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,298
BUT MARK CUBAN HAS JUST MADE
THE LARGEST OFFER

00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,267
IN "SHARK TANK" HISTORY.

00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:16,002
Cuban: LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION.

00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:18,404
I IF I OFFERED YOU
$30 MILLION FOR THE COMPANY,
WOULD YOU TAKE IT?

00:12:27,924 --> 00:12:29,726
NO.

00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:33,763
OKAY.
I WOULD NOT BE TAKING IT
BECAUSE WE SEE --

00:12:33,763 --> 00:12:36,799
WE SEE THIS BUSINESS GROWING
AS BIG AS Match.com.

00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:39,035
AND YOU KNOW HOW MUCH REVENUE
THEY ARE GENERATING?

00:12:39,035 --> 00:12:41,004
$800 MILLION A YEAR.

00:12:41,004 --> 00:12:43,172
THEY'RE BECOMING A
BILLION-DOLLAR REVENUE COMPANY.

00:12:43,172 --> 00:12:45,208
AND WE THINK THIS MODEL
AND THE PRODUCT

00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,744
HAS POTENTIAL TO BE
AS BIG AS MATCH.

00:12:47,744 --> 00:12:53,049
HE OFFERED YOU $30 MILLION,
AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN FLINCH.

00:12:53,049 --> 00:12:54,751
Cuban:
SHE SHOULD FEEL CONFIDENT.

00:12:54,751 --> 00:12:56,986
IT'S A NEWER EPHEMERAL VERSION
OF HOT OR NOT,

00:12:56,986 --> 00:12:58,755
WHICH IS BRILLIANT.

00:12:58,755 --> 00:13:01,057
BUT I DON'T KNOW
HOW PROTECTABLE THAT IS.

00:13:01,057 --> 00:13:02,859
WHILE I GIVE YOU
TOTAL CREDIT

00:13:02,859 --> 00:13:04,794
AND I THINK YOU GUYS HAVE DONE
SOME BRILLIANT THINGS,

00:13:04,794 --> 00:13:06,763
I DON'T THINK THE RISK/REWARD
IS THERE FOR ME,

00:13:06,763 --> 00:13:09,098
AND FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M STILL OUT.

00:13:09,098 --> 00:13:10,199
Greiner: GOOD LUCK.
THANK YOU.

00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:12,935
O'Leary:
EXCELLENT PRESENTATION.

00:13:12,935 --> 00:13:16,105
Arum:
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY --
LIKE IN DATING, NEVER SETTLE.

00:13:16,105 --> 00:13:19,976
WHILE $30 MILLION MAY SOUND LIKE
A LOT OF MONEY,

00:13:19,976 --> 00:13:21,944
YOU WAIT, MR. MARK CUBAN,

00:13:21,944 --> 00:13:25,048
BECAUSE THIS BABY
IS GOING TO EXPLODE.

00:13:28,985 --> 00:13:32,188
Narrator: IN SEASON 5,
PETE HAMBORG, HIS SON, GUS,

00:13:32,188 --> 00:13:34,924
AND THEIR COUSIN DONNIE SANDUSKY
INTRODUCED THE SHARKS

00:13:34,924 --> 00:13:36,926
TO THEIR SKATEBOARDING
INNOVATION.

00:13:36,926 --> 00:13:38,861
$300,000, 30%.

00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:40,063
ROBERT, WE WANT TO DO BUSINESS
WITH YOU.
ALL RIGHT!

00:13:40,063 --> 00:13:42,131
Narrator: LET'S SEE
WHAT THEY'RE UP TO NOW.

00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,769
"SHARK TANK" IS THE BEST
THING THAT'S EVER HAPPENED
TO OUR BUSINESS.

00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:48,204
IN THE YEAR LEADING UP
TO OUR PITCH,

00:13:48,204 --> 00:13:51,808
WE HAD DONE ABOUT $225,000
IN SALES.

00:13:51,808 --> 00:13:52,975
A YEAR AFTER "SHARK TANK,"

00:13:52,975 --> 00:13:55,845
OUR TOTAL SALES HAVE EXCEEDED
$1 MILLION.

00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,116
WE'RE PROUD TO SAY
WE'RE CONTINUING

00:14:00,116 --> 00:14:01,918
TO MAKE OUR PRODUCTS
BY HAND

00:14:01,918 --> 00:14:03,920
HERE IN HUNTINGTON BEACH,
CALIFORNIA.

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,122
THE COMPANY'S GROWING
PRETTY MUCH AS FAST
AS WE CAN HANDLE IT.

00:14:06,122 --> 00:14:08,057
WE'VE DOUBLED
OUR WAREHOUSE SPACE,

00:14:08,057 --> 00:14:09,826
WE'VE ADDED
THREE NEW EMPLOYEES,

00:14:09,826 --> 00:14:12,862
AND WE'VE BUILT A COMPLETELY
NEW INTERNET WEB STORE.

00:14:12,862 --> 00:14:14,130
HEY, GUYS!

00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,932
HEY!
HEY!

00:14:15,932 --> 00:14:18,134
PETE, DONNIE, AND GUS
ARE KILLING IT.

00:14:18,134 --> 00:14:19,836
$1 MILLION IN SALES

00:14:19,836 --> 00:14:21,804
IN SUCH A SHORT AMOUNT
OF TIME -- IT'S INCREDIBLE.

00:14:21,804 --> 00:14:23,940
YOU KNOW, NEXT STEP
IS $2 MILLION, $3 MILLION.

00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,209
WE JUST GOT TO BE REALLY CAREFUL
WITH INVENTORY CONTROL.

00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:28,044
Sandusky:
ROBERT AND HIS TEAM HAVE BEEN

00:14:28,044 --> 00:14:29,178
WONDERFUL BUSINESS PARTNERS
AND COACHES.

00:14:29,178 --> 00:14:31,981
THEY SET US UP ON A CLEAR PATH
TO GROW RESPONSIBLY,

00:14:31,981 --> 00:14:33,749
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT WE NEEDED.

00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:35,818
HEY, CAN WE GO TRY THEM
ON THE BEACH?
LET'S DO IT.

00:14:35,818 --> 00:14:38,187
Pete: WE DO STREET SURFING
BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE.

00:14:38,187 --> 00:14:40,056
AND WHAT
WE'VE INADVERTENTLY DONE

00:14:40,056 --> 00:14:41,891
IS WE'VE STARTED
A WHOLE NEW SPORT --

00:14:41,891 --> 00:14:43,826
STREET STAND-UP PADDLING.

00:14:43,826 --> 00:14:46,963
WE'RE ON THE GROUND FLOOR
OF A MOVEMENT THAT'S STARTING.

00:14:46,963 --> 00:14:49,765
GOSH.
YEP, THIS LOOKS GREAT.
THANK YOU.

00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:50,900
BECAUSE OF "SHARK TANK,"

00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,035
WE'RE STRONGER AS A FAMILY
AND AS A BUSINESS.

00:14:53,035 --> 00:14:54,871
WE WOULDN'T TRADE IT
FOR ANYTHING.

00:14:54,871 --> 00:14:56,839
Herjavec:
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU CAN START
A BUSINESS WITH YOUR KIDS

00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:58,975
AND BUILD
A MILLION-DOLLAR BUSINESS,

00:14:58,975 --> 00:15:00,810
THAT IS THE AMERICAN DREAM.

00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:01,978
THAT'S WHAT "SHARK TANK"
IS ALL ABOUT.

00:15:01,978 --> 00:15:03,946
AND I'M HAPPY TO BE PART
OF THEIR DREAM.

00:15:12,021 --> 00:15:14,023
Narrator:
NEXT UP IS A PRODUCT DESIGNED

00:15:14,023 --> 00:15:16,759
TO MAKE WOMEN LOOK
CLASSY AND SEXY.

00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,903
HI, SHARKS.
I'M JULIE KALIMIAN.

00:15:26,903 --> 00:15:28,104
I LIVE IN NEW YORK.

00:15:28,104 --> 00:15:29,839
MY COMPANY IS SkinnyShirt,

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,776
AND I AM SEEKING $100,000
FOR 20% OF MY BUSINESS.

00:15:33,776 --> 00:15:37,146
LADIES, HAS THIS EVER HAPPENED
TO YOU?

00:15:37,146 --> 00:15:40,049
YOU PUT ON YOUR FAVORITE
BUTTON-DOWN SHIRT

00:15:40,049 --> 00:15:43,152
AND A GORGEOUS SWEATER,
AND, UGH!

00:15:43,152 --> 00:15:45,922
INSTEAD OF LOOKING
SLEEK AND SLIM,

00:15:45,922 --> 00:15:48,090
YOU LOOK BUNCHY AND BULKY
INSTEAD?

00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,059
SkinnyShirt
TO THE RESCUE.

00:15:50,059 --> 00:15:53,896
I HAVE COMBINED TWO ALL-TIME
FAVORITE CLOTHING ITEMS --

00:15:53,896 --> 00:15:57,200
THE CLASSIC BUTTON-DOWN SHIRT
AND THE STRETCHY KNIT CAMI

00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,135
TO ELIMINATE THE BULK.

00:15:59,135 --> 00:16:01,804
BUT SINCE SEEING IS BELIEVING,
KRISTIN HERE

00:16:01,804 --> 00:16:03,739
IS GONNA TAKE OFF
HER TRADITIONAL SHIRT

00:16:03,739 --> 00:16:06,042
AND SLIP ON A SkinnyShirt
TO SHOW YOU

00:16:06,042 --> 00:16:08,177
EXACTLY WHAT A BIG DIFFERENCE
SkinnyShirt CAN MAKE.

00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:10,980
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,848
Greiner:
YOU JUST GOT THEIR ATTENTION.

00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:14,116
Corcoran: OH, BOYS.

00:16:14,116 --> 00:16:15,885
NOW <i>REALLY</i>
GOT YOUR ATTENTION.
Herjavec: [ HUMMING ]

00:16:15,885 --> 00:16:19,155
LAYERING IS A CLASSIC
AND EASY WAY TO DRESS.

00:16:19,155 --> 00:16:20,790
[ LAUGHS ]

00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,758
BUT NOBODY LIKES IT
WHEN THE LAYERS

00:16:22,758 --> 00:16:25,928
MAKE YOU LOOK BIGGER
THAN YOU ACTUALLY ARE.

00:16:25,928 --> 00:16:27,863
SO, SAY GOODBYE
TO THAT BULKY SHIRT...

00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:29,098
Corcoran: PAY ATTENTION, MEN.
HERE WE GO.

00:16:29,098 --> 00:16:31,801
...AND SAY
HELLO TO SkinnyShirt.

00:16:31,801 --> 00:16:33,102
SORRY. THERE'S A SHIRT
IN HERE SOMEWHERE?

00:16:33,102 --> 00:16:34,170
[ LAUGHS ]

00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:36,939
SkinnyShirt CAN BE PAIRED
WITH V-NECKS,

00:16:36,939 --> 00:16:39,075
CREW NECKS, BLAZERS,

00:16:39,075 --> 00:16:40,843
CARDIGANS, SHIFT DRESSES,

00:16:40,843 --> 00:16:45,014
AND IT'S EVEN CUTE ENOUGH
TO BE WORN ALONE.

00:16:45,014 --> 00:16:47,149
NOW, <i>THAT</i> WAS EFFECTIVE.
[ LAUGHS ]

00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:49,819
GREAT PRESENTATION THERE.
THANK YOU.

00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:50,953
DO IT AGAIN.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:16:50,953 --> 00:16:53,089
KRISTEN, COME ON OUT HERE.

00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:55,725
WOW.

00:16:55,725 --> 00:17:00,830
NOW, SHARKS, LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT THE BEFORE AND AFTER.

00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:03,065
WHO IS THAT?
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:06,769
AS I'M SURE
YOU WILL ALL AGREE,

00:17:06,769 --> 00:17:09,205
KRISTEN LOOKS
MORE PULLED TOGETHER,

00:17:09,205 --> 00:17:14,977
NOT TO MENTION SLEEKER,
SMOOTHER, SLIMMER, SEXIER.

00:17:14,977 --> 00:17:17,079
SO, NOW,
WHICH ONE OF YOU SHARKS

00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:20,016
WANTS TO MAKE A FAT PROFIT
ON MY SkinnyShirt?

00:17:20,016 --> 00:17:22,718
CAN YOU HAND US ONE OF THE
PACKAGES SO WE CAN CHECK IT OUT?
YES.

00:17:22,718 --> 00:17:24,053
KRISTEN HAS ONE
FOR EVERYBODY.

00:17:24,053 --> 00:17:27,189
Herjavec:
IS IT JUST A SPORTY MATERIAL
THAT BRINGS THE SHIRT IN?

00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:29,058
IS THAT WHY IT'S --

00:17:29,058 --> 00:17:30,926
SO, IT'S A STRETCHY KNIT CAMI.

00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:32,862
IT'S A SHAPER
OR NOT A SHAPER?
IT IS.

00:17:32,862 --> 00:17:34,030
O'Leary: THANK YOU.
IT FEEL LIKE A SECOND SKIN,

00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,799
BUT IT ALSO SMOOTHES YOU OUT
AND HOLDS YOU IN.

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,036
Herjavec:
IS THE DESIGN OF IT UNIQUE
OR IS THE MATERIAL UNIQUE?

00:17:40,036 --> 00:17:42,238
OR IS IT NOT UNIQUE?
IT IS UNIQUE.

00:17:42,238 --> 00:17:43,973
AND THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THIS
ON THE MARKETPLACE.

00:17:43,973 --> 00:17:46,208
WELL,
I'M ASSUMING IT'S UNIQUE.
IT IS 100% UNIQUE.

00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,110
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES,
JULIE?

00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,145
IN THE LAST THREE YEARS,

00:17:49,145 --> 00:17:51,113
I'VE DONE A HALF-MILLION
DOLLARS' WORTH OF SALES.

00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:52,782
WOW.

00:17:52,782 --> 00:17:54,717
THIS YEAR, I'M ON TRACK
FOR $200,000.

00:17:54,717 --> 00:17:55,818
WHAT WAS
JUST LAST YEAR ALONE?

00:17:55,818 --> 00:17:57,186
LAST YEAR ALONE WAS $50,000.

00:17:57,186 --> 00:17:59,755
WAIT, SO YOU WENT DOWN?

00:17:59,755 --> 00:18:02,024
YES,
BECAUSE A TRUSTED FRIEND

00:18:02,024 --> 00:18:05,728
INTRODUCED ME TO AN
UNTRUSTWORTHY MANUFACTURER.

00:18:05,728 --> 00:18:08,898
AND I HAD TO EAT A LOT OF
BAD PRODUCTION, UNFORTUNATELY.

00:18:08,898 --> 00:18:10,900
AND IT TOOK A WHILE
TILL I FOUND A NEW MANUFACTURER

00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,034
I FELT COMFORTABLE WITH.

00:18:12,034 --> 00:18:13,903
SO, I GUESS YOUR TRUSTED FRIEND
ISN'T SO TRUSTWORTHY.

00:18:13,903 --> 00:18:15,171
YOU KNOW WHAT? HE THOUGHT
HE WAS DOING ME A FAVOR,

00:18:15,171 --> 00:18:17,106
BUT APPARENTLY --
Corcoran:
BUT YOUR FRIEND INTRODUCED YOU,

00:18:17,106 --> 00:18:19,008
BUT YOU HIRED
THE MANUFACTURER.
RIGHT.

00:18:19,008 --> 00:18:20,209
AND THEY HAD HAD
A GOOD TRACK RECORD.

00:18:20,209 --> 00:18:22,845
HAVE YOU SOLVED THAT PROBLEM?
YES.

00:18:22,845 --> 00:18:26,982
I HAVE A MANUFACTURER ALREADY
SOURCED IN ASIA WHO CAN --

00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:28,984
MY PRODUCT RIGHT NOW,
I'M MANUFACTURING IT

00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:32,154
FOR $12.75 A SHIRT
FOR THE SLEEVELESS.
THIS ONE?

00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:34,890
YEAH. I HAVE SOMEBODY
WHO'S WILLING TO DO $9.50.

00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,826
JULIE,
WHAT DO YOU SELL IT FOR?

00:18:36,826 --> 00:18:38,160
$68 FOR THE SLEEVELESS
AND $76 FOR THE LONG SLEEVE.
Greiner: WOW.

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,096
AND HOW DO YOU SELL THEM?

00:18:40,096 --> 00:18:42,098
2/3 OF MY SALES
ARE ON MY WEBSITE,

00:18:42,098 --> 00:18:44,867
AND 1/3
IS THROUGH WHOLESALERS.

00:18:44,867 --> 00:18:47,970
I'VE GOT 75 BOUTIQUES
IN THE U.S. AND CANADA.

00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:51,807
AND I HAD AN ORDER FOR ONE
PARTICULAR TV RETAILER THAT,

00:18:51,807 --> 00:18:54,176
THE DAY IT WAS MEANT TO SHIP,

00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:56,979
THIS UNTRUSTWORTHY MANUFACTURER
CALLED ME AND SAID,

00:18:56,979 --> 00:18:58,714
"I ONLY HAVE HALF YOUR ORDER."

00:18:58,714 --> 00:19:00,015
SO,
YOU HAD A QUALITY ISSUE

00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:01,751
<i>AND</i> YOU HAD A DELIVERY ISSUE
FROM ONE PERSON.

00:19:01,751 --> 00:19:03,719
SO, WHEN I LAUNCHED --
RIGHT.

00:19:03,719 --> 00:19:05,888
I LAUNCHED,
AND I DID ONE LARGE ORDER.

00:19:05,888 --> 00:19:07,123
IS YOUR BACKGROUND
IN TEXTILES?
NO.

00:19:07,123 --> 00:19:08,858
FASHION?
NOT AT ALL.

00:19:08,858 --> 00:19:11,694
I SPENT OVER 15 YEARS IN THE
CORPORATE WORLD IN PUBLISHING

00:19:11,694 --> 00:19:13,863
BEFORE I BECAME A STAY-AT-HOME
MOM WITH MY FOUR KIDS

00:19:13,863 --> 00:19:15,231
AND HAD MY FIFTH BABY.

00:19:15,231 --> 00:19:16,899
WOW.

00:19:16,899 --> 00:19:18,167
THANK YOU.
Cuban:
HELP ME WITH THE NUMBERS.

00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:19,168
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU DONE
YEAR-TO-DATE?

00:19:19,168 --> 00:19:21,170
I'VE DONE $70,000.
OKAY.

00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,172
SO, YOU'VE DONE $70,000
THIS YEAR.

00:19:23,172 --> 00:19:25,141
LAST YEAR WE'LL "X" OUT,
RIGHT?

00:19:25,141 --> 00:19:27,076
'CAUSE THAT WAS A PROBLEM.

00:19:27,076 --> 00:19:29,812
BUT YOU HAD TWO YEARS PRIOR
TO THAT, RIGHT?
YES.

00:19:29,812 --> 00:19:32,181
WHAT WAS THE YEAR BEFORE?
$150,000.

00:19:32,181 --> 00:19:34,183
AND THE YEAR BEFORE THAT
WAS $350,000.

00:19:34,183 --> 00:19:35,851
THAT'S WHAT I WAS GETTING TO,
RIGHT?

00:19:35,851 --> 00:19:37,787
SO, YOU TALKED ABOUT

00:19:37,787 --> 00:19:40,022
THIS HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE
IN MANUFACTURING.

00:19:40,022 --> 00:19:42,858
YET, THE TWO YEARS PRIOR
TO THAT,

00:19:42,858 --> 00:19:44,727
YOU DID FAR MORE BUSINESS

00:19:44,727 --> 00:19:47,830
AND WERE AT A FASTER PACE
THAN YOU ARE THIS YEAR.

00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:50,232
WHY DID IT FALL IN HALF
TO THE SECOND YEAR?

00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:51,767
GREAT QUESTION.

00:19:51,767 --> 00:19:53,836
I STOPPED WORKING
WITH THAT MANUFACTURER.

00:19:53,836 --> 00:19:56,205
AND IT TOOK A LONG TIME
TO TEE UP A NEW MANUFACTURER.

00:19:56,205 --> 00:19:57,807
AND ON TOP OF THAT --
OKAY, WAIT.

00:19:57,807 --> 00:19:59,008
SOMETHING'S NOT --
SOMETHING'S NOT WORKING HERE.

00:19:59,008 --> 00:20:01,177
WITH ALL THOSE CHALLENGES,

00:20:01,177 --> 00:20:04,980
YOU DID MORE
IN THAT FIRST YEAR

00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,916
THAN YOU'RE ON PACE TO DO
THIS YEAR.

00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,184
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE INVENTORY
TO MONETIZE.

00:20:08,184 --> 00:20:10,152
THAT'S WHAT HAMPERING
THE SALES.

00:20:10,152 --> 00:20:12,121
IT'S ALL LOGISTICS PROBLEMS.
NO, IT'S NOT!

00:20:12,121 --> 00:20:14,023
MARK, LET ME --
MAYBE I CAN ANSWER IT THIS WAY.
OKAY.

00:20:14,023 --> 00:20:17,026
THREE OF MY TOP WHOLESALERS
TOOK A YEAR HIATUS

00:20:17,026 --> 00:20:18,894
'CAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE INVENTORY
TO SELL THEM.

00:20:18,894 --> 00:20:20,196
BUT YOU JUST SAID
YOU HAD TO EAT INVENTORY.

00:20:20,196 --> 00:20:23,199
BUT EATING THE INVENTORY
WAS UNSALABLE SHIRTS.

00:20:23,199 --> 00:20:25,201
AND IT LASTED
TWO AND A HALF YEARS?

00:20:25,201 --> 00:20:26,869
NO, IT LASTED ONE YEAR.

00:20:26,869 --> 00:20:28,737
BUT THEN I DIDN'T HAVE
THE CAPITAL TO GO OUT

00:20:28,737 --> 00:20:30,139
AND MAKE
A SIZEABLE ENOUGH ORDER.

00:20:30,139 --> 00:20:32,775
IT HAMPERED MY ABILITY
TO SELL AND DELIVER PRODUCTS.

00:20:32,775 --> 00:20:34,777
THE NUMBERS AREN'T ADDING UP,
IS WHERE I'M GOING.

00:20:34,777 --> 00:20:37,179
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE STUCK
ON THE NUMBERS, THOUGH.
WHY NOT?

00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:38,881
BECAUSE
SHE HAD BAD-QUALITY GOODS

00:20:38,881 --> 00:20:41,750
SO SHE COULDN'T SELL THEM,
SO SHE HAD TO EAT IT.

00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,953
LET'S STOP TALKING ABOUT
ALL THE PROBLEMS YOU HAD
WITH THE LOGISTICS.

00:20:43,953 --> 00:20:45,855
IS THIS A GOOD IDEA OR NOT?

00:20:45,855 --> 00:20:47,890
IF IT'S A GOOD IDEA,

00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:50,092
WHAT STOPS SOMEBODY WHO
ACTUALLY KNOWS HOW TO MAKE
SHIRTS AND DELIVER THEM,

00:20:50,092 --> 00:20:51,794
DO THIS
AND MAKE A LOT OF MONEY

00:20:51,794 --> 00:20:54,230
AND CRUSH YOU LIKE THE COCKROACH
THAT YOU ARE?

00:20:56,031 --> 00:20:58,767
OKAY. FIRST OF ALL,
I'M NOT A COCKROACH.

00:20:58,767 --> 00:20:59,835
[ LAUGHS ]
AND SECONDLY --

00:20:59,835 --> 00:21:01,737
YOU HAVE NO MARKET SHARE
OF MAYBE A GOOD IDEA.

00:21:01,737 --> 00:21:02,972
OKAY.
IT IS PATENT-PENDING.

00:21:02,972 --> 00:21:04,106
AND I'VE SOLD 10,000 SHIRTS.

00:21:04,106 --> 00:21:06,876
I HAVE GREAT BRANDING.
I HAVE A GREAT TRADEMARK.

00:21:06,876 --> 00:21:10,713
I'M HERE BECAUSE I NEED
SOME CAPITAL FOR TWO REASONS --

00:21:10,713 --> 00:21:13,983
FOR MANUFACTURING CONTACTS
AND DISTRIBUTION CONTACTS.

00:21:13,983 --> 00:21:15,818
SO, I HAVE TO PAY FOR YOU
TO LEARN.

00:21:15,818 --> 00:21:17,052
I'M NOT SAYING
YOU'RE A BAD PERSON.

00:21:17,052 --> 00:21:19,788
IT'S JUST YOU'RE NOT A GOOD BET
FOR ME AS AN INVESTOR

00:21:19,788 --> 00:21:21,957
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

00:21:21,957 --> 00:21:23,859
I DO KNOW WHAT --
NO, YOU DON'T.

00:21:23,859 --> 00:21:25,194
YOU'VE BLOWN IT A COUPLE
OF TIMES IN THE LAST TWO YEARS.

00:21:25,194 --> 00:21:26,996
BUT I'M --
Greiner:
SHE'S A BEGINNER.

00:21:26,996 --> 00:21:29,198
I'M HERE --
I DON'T CARE. I DON'T CARE
IF YOU'RE A BEGINNER.

00:21:29,198 --> 00:21:31,233
HOW SHE'S GONNA KNOW
JUST AUTOMATICALLY HOW
TO BE A MANUFACTURER?

00:21:31,233 --> 00:21:33,836
I WANT TO MAKE MONEY.
I WANT TO MAKE MONEY!
AND I WANT TO MAKE MONEY.

00:21:33,836 --> 00:21:36,038
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
ADMIT IT? YOU'VE NEVER
HAD 12 MONTHS IN A ROW

00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:37,840
WHERE YOU'VE
LOGISTICALLY EXECUTED.

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,808
IF THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG
WITH YOUR PRESENTATION,

00:21:39,808 --> 00:21:43,779
75% OF IT WAS EXPLAINING
HOW YOU SCREWED UP, BASICALLY.

00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:46,916
DON'T COME IN HERE TELLING ME
WHY YOU SCREWED UP.

00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:49,718
TELL ME
HOW YOU'VE FIXED IT.

00:21:49,718 --> 00:21:51,720
I'M OUT.

00:21:53,756 --> 00:21:57,760
JULIE, I GIVE YOU CREDIT
FOR GETTING IT GOING.

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,062
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU WERE
ON A ROLL INITIALLY

00:22:00,062 --> 00:22:01,797
AND THEN YOU
RAN INTO PROBLEMS

00:22:01,797 --> 00:22:03,165
AND JUST HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE
TO REGROUP.

00:22:03,165 --> 00:22:06,201
I JUST DON'T GET THE SENSE
THAT YOU HAVE A DEFINITIVE PLAN.

00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:09,138
FOR THE PLAN, I HAVE LINED UP
AN OVERSEAS MANUFACTURER.

00:22:09,138 --> 00:22:11,173
I NEED THE CAPITAL
TO PLACE THAT ORDER.

00:22:11,173 --> 00:22:12,141
RIGHT.
THAT'S A CASH-MANAGEMENT ISSUE.

00:22:12,141 --> 00:22:13,909
I DON'T THINK
GIVING YOU CASH

00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:17,079
SOLVES YOUR ABILITY TO MANAGE
CASH AND DEAL WITH THOSE ISSUES.

00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:19,148
I STILL THINK THE NUMBERS
DON'T ADD UP.

00:22:19,148 --> 00:22:22,718
AND SO, FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.

00:22:22,718 --> 00:22:24,853
YOU GUYS LOOK FANTASTIC.

00:22:24,853 --> 00:22:27,790
I THINK
IT'S A GOOD PRODUCT.

00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,959
I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S A STAND-ALONE CATEGORY.

00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:33,228
BUT I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE
THE ANSWER TODAY.

00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:36,098
AND, YOU KNOW, WHILE GETTING
AN INVESTMENT FROM -- FROM ME

00:22:36,098 --> 00:22:38,200
OR ANYBODY HERE IS A JOURNEY,

00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,070
BUT I NEED YOU TO KNOW WHERE
YOU'RE GOING DOWN THAT JOURNEY.

00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,838
I DIDN'T SEE THAT TODAY.
I'M OUT.

00:22:44,773 --> 00:22:47,776
I MEAN,
I THINK THERE'S MERIT TO IT.

00:22:47,776 --> 00:22:49,878
PEOPLE LIKE SHAPERS.

00:22:49,878 --> 00:22:52,815
MY PROBLEM IS,
IS I DON'T REALLY LIKE

00:22:52,815 --> 00:22:54,717
THE LOOK OF A COLLARED SHIRT
UNDER A SWEATER.

00:22:54,717 --> 00:22:57,853
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH
PEOPLE WEAR THAT ANYMORE.

00:22:57,853 --> 00:22:59,755
I'M NOT TRYING TO INSULT IT,

00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:01,991
BUT I'M JUST --
I NEVER WEAR THAT LOOK.

00:23:01,991 --> 00:23:04,893
AND BECAUSE I DON'T GET
THE FASHION STATEMENT THAT WELL,

00:23:04,893 --> 00:23:06,095
I'M OUT.

00:23:09,932 --> 00:23:11,767
Kalimian: BARBARA?

00:23:13,068 --> 00:23:14,837
Corcoran:
ONE THING I HAVE TO SAY,

00:23:14,837 --> 00:23:17,072
YOU HELD YOUR GROUND HERE
VERY WELL TODAY.

00:23:17,072 --> 00:23:19,975
THANK YOU.
AND YOU DON'T SEEM BOTHERED

00:23:19,975 --> 00:23:22,711
BY THIS GUY ON MY LEFT
WHO'S A BULLY,

00:23:22,711 --> 00:23:26,115
THE OTHER BULLY WHO GRILLED YOU
ON MONEY INSIDE AND OUT.

00:23:26,115 --> 00:23:28,817
THANK YOU.
BUT THERE'S ONE THING
THAT REALLY BOTHERS ME.

00:23:28,817 --> 00:23:31,186
OKAY.
AND THAT IS
THE TIME YOU SPENT

00:23:31,186 --> 00:23:33,188
ON TALKING
ABOUT THE MISHAP YOU HAD

00:23:33,188 --> 00:23:34,990
WITH THE WRONG MANUFACTURER.

00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:37,960
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE
LEARNED OVER ALL THE YEARS
OF BEING IN BUSINESS?

00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,829
I FOUND THE ONLY DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THE GREAT WINNERS

00:23:40,829 --> 00:23:43,098
AND EVERYBODY ELSE
IS NOT THE HITS

00:23:43,098 --> 00:23:46,101
BUT HOW LONG THEY TOOK
TO FEEL SORRY FOR THEMSELVES.

00:23:46,101 --> 00:23:48,804
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT I THINK?

00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:50,005
THAT'S YOUR ACHILLES' HEEL.

00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,809
I'M OUT.

00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:55,744
OKAY.
GOOD LUCK.

00:23:55,744 --> 00:23:56,979
THANK YOU.

00:24:00,082 --> 00:24:03,752
THIS IS NOT THE END
OF MY COMPANY AT ALL.

00:24:03,752 --> 00:24:05,788
I KNOW THAT IT'S GONNA BE
A HUGE SUCCESS,

00:24:05,788 --> 00:24:07,823
AND I THINK THAT THE SHARKS
ARE GONNA LOOK BACK

00:24:07,823 --> 00:24:08,924
AND BE LIKE, "MM!" YOU KNOW?

00:24:08,924 --> 00:24:10,826
"MAYBE WE DIDN'T CONNECT
THE DOTS ON THAT ONE,

00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:12,027
BUT, WOW, GOOD FOR HER."

00:24:22,905 --> 00:24:25,040
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS AN ENTREPRENEUR

00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,210
WITH A SOLUTION TO A COMMON
PROBLEM WITH ONLINE SHOPPING.

00:24:32,815 --> 00:24:34,016
HI, SHARKS.

00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:37,720
I'M ZANDER ADELL, AND I'M FROM
SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA.

00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,788
MY COMPANY IS
DOORMAN PACKAGE DELIVERY.

00:24:39,788 --> 00:24:44,059
I'M SEEKING $250,000
FOR A 10% EQUITY IN THE COMPANY.

00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:46,095
SO, EVERYBODY LOVES
SHOPPING ONLINE,

00:24:46,095 --> 00:24:47,730
EXCEPT FOR THE PART

00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,031
WHERE YOU ACTUALLY GET
THE STUFF YOU BOUGHT.

00:24:49,031 --> 00:24:51,200
EITHER YOU GET A "MISSED
DELIVERY" STICKER ON YOUR DOOR

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,902
OR YOUR PACKAGE IS LEFT
ON YOUR FRONT PORCH

00:24:53,902 --> 00:24:56,004
WHERE IT'S RAINED ON OR STOLEN,

00:24:56,004 --> 00:24:58,807
OR YOU GET TO SPEND A SATURDAY
AT SOME PACKAGE PICK-UP CENTER

00:24:58,807 --> 00:24:59,942
MILES FROM YOUR HOUSE.

00:24:59,942 --> 00:25:02,077
WHAT IF YOU COULD GET
YOUR PACKAGED DELIVERED AT NIGHT

00:25:02,077 --> 00:25:04,747
WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY HOME?

00:25:04,747 --> 00:25:06,782
AND WHAT IF YOU COULD SCHEDULE
IT ALL FROM AN APP?

00:25:06,782 --> 00:25:08,050
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BUILT.

00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:10,819
DOORMAN IS
AN ON-DEMAND MOBILE SERVICE

00:25:10,819 --> 00:25:12,921
THAT PROVIDES PACKAGE DELIVERY
ON <i>YOUR</i> SCHEDULE.

00:25:12,921 --> 00:25:14,123
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

00:25:14,123 --> 00:25:17,092
WHEN YOU SIGN UP,
YOU GET A NEW SHIPPING ADDRESS

00:25:17,092 --> 00:25:21,063
THAT LETS YOU SEND ALL OF
YOUR PACKAGES TO OUR WAREHOUSE.

00:25:21,063 --> 00:25:24,133
ONCE THEY ARRIVE, YOU GET
A NOTIFICATION ON YOUR PHONE.

00:25:24,133 --> 00:25:26,201
YOU CAN NOW GET
YOUR PACKAGES DELIVERED

00:25:26,201 --> 00:25:28,971
TILL MIDNIGHT SEVEN DAYS A WEEK.

00:25:28,971 --> 00:25:32,841
THIS IS THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION
THAT FINALLY SOLVES

00:25:32,841 --> 00:25:34,810
THE LAST THING WRONG

00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:36,712
WITH THE QUARTER-TRILLION-DOLLAR
E-COMMERCE MARKET

00:25:36,712 --> 00:25:37,880
IN THE UNITED STATES.

00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,816
AND WE WOULD LOVE YOUR HELP
TO TAKE THIS NATIONWIDE.

00:25:40,816 --> 00:25:42,751
I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER
ANY QUESTIONS.

00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:44,720
ZANDER, HOW MUCH DO I PAY YOU
FOR AN AVERAGE PACKAGE?

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,188
IT'S $3.99 PER PACKAGE.

00:25:46,188 --> 00:25:47,790
OR, IF YOU LIKE THE SERVICE,

00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,892
IT'S 19 BUCKS A MONTH
FOR UNLIMITED.

00:25:49,892 --> 00:25:51,994
Corcoran:
AND IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE
WHAT SIZE THE PACKAGE IS?

00:25:51,994 --> 00:25:54,096
RIGHT NOW,
WE HAVE DELIVERY LIMITS

00:25:54,096 --> 00:25:55,731
BASED ON OUR CURRENT DEPOT.

00:25:55,731 --> 00:25:58,033
40 POUNDS OR OVER,
3√ FEET ON A SIDE.

00:25:58,033 --> 00:25:59,768
O'Leary:
WHAT CITY IS THIS OPERATING IN?

00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:01,036
RIGHT NOW,
WE'RE ONLY IN SAN FRANCISCO.

00:26:01,036 --> 00:26:02,871
HOW MANY SUBSCRIBERS
DO YOU HAVE?

00:26:02,871 --> 00:26:04,006
WE JUST CAME OUT IN MAY.

00:26:04,006 --> 00:26:06,975
AND WE NOW HAVE 300 CUSTOMERS
ON OUR PLATFORM.

00:26:06,975 --> 00:26:08,944
THEY'VE SHIPPED 4,000 PACKAGES
THROUGH US.

00:26:08,944 --> 00:26:12,014
HOW MUCH DID IT COST YOU
TO SET UP THAT MANY CUSTOMERS?

00:26:12,014 --> 00:26:13,849
I PUT 50K OF MY OWN MONEY IN.

00:26:13,849 --> 00:26:19,021
AND SINCE THEN, WE'VE TAKEN IN
220K OF CONVERTIBLE NOTES.

00:26:19,021 --> 00:26:20,756
O'Leary:
SO, THE BUSINESS IS SUCCESSFUL.

00:26:20,756 --> 00:26:22,124
THE CONCEPT HAS BEEN PROVEN.

00:26:22,124 --> 00:26:23,826
I'M UPS, I'M FedEx.

00:26:23,826 --> 00:26:25,961
I SIMPLY ADD THIS FEATURE
TO MY INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:26:25,961 --> 00:26:28,096
THAT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.

00:26:28,096 --> 00:26:30,799
I DON'T NEED YOUR ANSWER, MARK.
I WANT HIS.

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,168
EVEN IF ALL OF THEM DID IT,
YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE AN APP

00:26:33,168 --> 00:26:36,205
FOR EVERY SINGLE CARRIER,
WHEREAS WE'RE AGNOSTIC.

00:26:36,205 --> 00:26:38,006
THE ULTIMATE VISION
FOR THE COMPANY

00:26:38,006 --> 00:26:40,075
IS TO HAVE A CHECKBOX
ON RETAIL SITES.

00:26:40,075 --> 00:26:42,744
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
NOW, IF THAT WAS ON AMAZON,
THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING.

00:26:42,744 --> 00:26:43,879
RIGHT.
I AGREE.

00:26:43,879 --> 00:26:44,980
Herjavec:
IT'S A GREAT IDEA,

00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,115
BUT THE COST TO SET UP A FedEx
WAS MASSIVE.

00:26:47,115 --> 00:26:49,785
SO, OUR DRIVERS ARE DRIVING
THEIR OWN CARS.

00:26:49,785 --> 00:26:51,820
SO, WE JUST HAVE TO RENT
WAREHOUSE SPACE.

00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,122
WE DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE
COSTS OF FedEx OR UPS.

00:26:54,122 --> 00:26:57,092
SO, ARE YOU GONNA DELIVER
AT A SPECIFIC TIME?

00:26:57,092 --> 00:26:58,827
SO, WE HAVE DIFFERENT OPTIONS.

00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:01,897
SO, OUR FIRST TWO PRICING PLANS
ARE TWO-HOUR DELIVERY WINDOWS.

00:27:01,897 --> 00:27:04,199
YOU CAN PICK 6:00 TO 8:00,
8:00 TO 10:00, 10:00 TO 12:00.

00:27:04,199 --> 00:27:05,934
BUT WE ALSO HAVE
ONE-HOUR WINDOWS.

00:27:05,934 --> 00:27:08,036
Greiner:
I THINK IT IS A GREAT IDEA.
THANK YOU.

00:27:08,036 --> 00:27:09,905
PACKAGES
ARE ALWAYS A PROBLEM,

00:27:09,905 --> 00:27:11,039
AND I'M ALWAYS ORDERING
ONLINE.

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,774
YOU DON'T HAVE A DOORMAN,
LORI?

00:27:12,774 --> 00:27:13,876
I DO HAVE A DOORMAN.
OH.

00:27:13,876 --> 00:27:15,944
BUT I PURPOSELY STAY

00:27:15,944 --> 00:27:19,147
IN A BUILDING WITH A DOORMAN
FOR PACKAGES, LITERALLY.

00:27:19,147 --> 00:27:22,050
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON ANYONE
WANTS A DOORMAN ANYMORE.
YES.

00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:25,821
BUT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
HOW YOU PLAN TO SCALE FROM THIS

00:27:25,821 --> 00:27:27,789
BECAUSE I DO SEE IT
BEING A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT

00:27:27,789 --> 00:27:28,891
AS YOU KEEP GROWING

00:27:28,891 --> 00:27:31,159
BECAUSE PEOPLE WON'T PARTNER
WITH YOU ONLINE UNLESS --

00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:33,095
O'Leary: RIGHT. LORI, IT'S UBER.
IT'S UBER ALL OVER AGAIN.

00:27:33,095 --> 00:27:35,063
CITY AT A TIME.
YEP.

00:27:35,063 --> 00:27:37,099
Adell:
THE MAIN THING THAT ACTUALLY
MAKES OUR MARGINS BETTER

00:27:37,099 --> 00:27:38,734
IS POPULATION DENSITY.

00:27:38,734 --> 00:27:39,902
THE MORE CUSTOMERS WE HAVE,

00:27:39,902 --> 00:27:41,203
THE CLOSER THOSE CUSTOMERS
ARE TO EACH OTHER

00:27:41,203 --> 00:27:43,105
IN ANY ONE- OR TWO-HOUR
TIME FRAME,

00:27:43,105 --> 00:27:45,807
THE MORE DELIVERIES WE CAN MAKE
AN HOUR, THE LOWER OUR COSTS.

00:27:45,807 --> 00:27:48,076
RIGHT NOW, WE'RE DOING
80 DELIVERIES A NIGHT

00:27:48,076 --> 00:27:50,045
WITH THREE DRIVERS.

00:27:50,045 --> 00:27:51,980
SO, IT DOESN'T TAKE
A WHOLE LOT OF DRIVERS

00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,882
FOR US TO DO A LOT OF SERVICE.

00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:55,951
YOU GO TO NEW YORK
OR YOU COME TO L.A.,

00:27:55,951 --> 00:27:57,185
TELL ME
THE MARKETING PLAN

00:27:57,185 --> 00:27:59,021
FOR PEOPLE TO FIND OUT
YOU'RE HERE.

00:27:59,021 --> 00:28:01,790
RIGHT NOW, IT'S COSTLY FOR US
TO FIND A CUSTOMER.

00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,692
OUR BEST CHANNEL RIGHT NOW
IS FACEBOOK.

00:28:03,692 --> 00:28:04,960
$37 PER CUSTOMER,
AND THAT'S A LOT.

00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,228
WOW.
WOW.
THAT'S A LOT.

00:28:06,228 --> 00:28:10,999
DO YOU HAVE ANY AGREEMENTS
WITH THE FedExes OR UPSes?
NO.

00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:12,834
WE WOULD LIKE TO.
WE'RE JUST NOT BIG ENOUGH YET.

00:28:12,834 --> 00:28:14,903
WITH RETAIL SITES, WE CAN HAVE
THESE CONVERSATIONS VERY EASILY.

00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:16,004
YOU NEED TO BE
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

00:28:16,004 --> 00:28:17,806
O'Leary:
NOT ALL OVER. SEVEN CITIES.

00:28:17,806 --> 00:28:19,908
Adell:
WE NEED A FEW MORE BIG MARKETS.
SEVEN CITIES IS LIKE 50%.

00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:21,843
RIGHT NOW, THE PLAN FOR
THE SECOND CITY IS CHICAGO.

00:28:21,843 --> 00:28:23,045
Greiner: YES!

00:28:28,717 --> 00:28:30,185
Corcoran: WE ALL LIKE HIM.
IT'S OBVIOUS.

00:28:30,185 --> 00:28:31,853
HE'S VERY TRUSTWORTHY.

00:28:31,853 --> 00:28:33,889
I THINK WE SHOULD ALL GO IN
ON THE DEAL.

00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:37,192
I LOVE THAT IDEA.

00:28:37,192 --> 00:28:39,795
I LOVE THAT IDEA, TOO.

00:28:39,795 --> 00:28:41,063
I LIKE IT.
I'M IN.

00:28:42,197 --> 00:28:44,933
I'LL DO YOUR ASK.
$250,000, 10%.

00:28:44,933 --> 00:28:46,201
I'M IN ON THAT.
WELL, THAT'S FUNNY.

00:28:46,201 --> 00:28:47,903
I WAS GONNA SAY 20%.

00:28:47,903 --> 00:28:49,104
OH, SORRY.
LET ME TAKE THAT BACK.

00:28:49,104 --> 00:28:50,772
[ CHUCKLES ]
I'M IN.

00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:52,741
$250,000 FOR 20%.

00:28:52,741 --> 00:28:54,009
I'M IN.
ALL RIGHT.

00:28:54,009 --> 00:28:56,111
LORI AND I ARE IN.
$250,000 FOR 20%.

00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:57,012
BARB, YOU IN?

00:28:57,012 --> 00:28:58,180
YEAH, DEFINITELY.

00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,915
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S THREE.

00:28:59,915 --> 00:29:01,783
Greiner: MARK?

00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:02,851
NO.

00:29:02,851 --> 00:29:03,986
KEVIN?

00:29:03,986 --> 00:29:05,887
MARK IS SO ARROGANT.
I'M NOT THERE.

00:29:05,887 --> 00:29:07,055
I'M NOT ARROGANT.
OH, YES, YOU ARE.

00:29:07,055 --> 00:29:09,024
IT'S JUST NOT WORTH THE TIME
AND EFFORT FOR THAT PERCENTAGE.

00:29:09,024 --> 00:29:11,159
O'Leary:
WHAT DO YOU CARE MORE FOR?

00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:13,195
I MEAN,
DO YOU WANT ONE SHARK?

00:29:13,195 --> 00:29:15,764
DO YOU THINK THERE'S VALUE
IN MULTIPLE SHARKS?

00:29:15,764 --> 00:29:18,100
THE DREAM, OF COURSE,
IS TO HAVE ALL THE SHARKS.

00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,136
BUT $250,000 AT 20%,

00:29:21,136 --> 00:29:24,906
IT'S -- THAT'S VALUING ALREADY
QUITE A BIT LOWER THAN --

00:29:24,906 --> 00:29:27,209
I'VE ALREADY REDUCED
THE VALUE, TOO.

00:29:27,209 --> 00:29:29,177
BUT YOU HAVE TO APPRECIATE,
ON OUR SIDE,

00:29:29,177 --> 00:29:32,114
WE HAVE TO AT LEAST
BE INTERESTED...
OF COURSE.

00:29:32,114 --> 00:29:33,915
...TO HELP YOU
WITH THE BUSINESS.
OF COURSE.

00:29:33,915 --> 00:29:35,817
AND YOU'VE GOT THREE OF US
INTERESTED.
AND THAT'S SKINNY AS IT IS.

00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:37,152
AND THAT'S AWESOME.

00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:40,122
AND WE'RE ALL
FROM DIFFERENT CITIES.
WHICH IS VERY COOL.

00:29:40,122 --> 00:29:42,758
A LOT OF INFLUENCE
IN EACH ONE OF THOSE CITIES.

00:29:42,758 --> 00:29:44,960
Herjavec:
MAKE ME A COUNTER.

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,161
20%. I AGREE WITH YOU.
IT'S TOO HIGH.

00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:47,929
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

00:29:47,929 --> 00:29:49,131
WHY WAS I LISTENING
TO BARBARA AGAIN?

00:29:49,131 --> 00:29:52,134
MAKE ME A COUNTER.

00:29:52,134 --> 00:29:55,170
UM...$250,000 FOR 12%.

00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,072
DONE.
OH!

00:29:57,072 --> 00:29:58,240
HE DIDN'T SAY DONE.

00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,241
I'LL DO IT ON MY OWN.

00:29:59,241 --> 00:30:01,209
YOU KNOW WHAT?
$250,000, 12%.

00:30:01,209 --> 00:30:02,978

ZANDER,
YOU'RE NOT CONSIDERING 20%?

00:30:20,762 --> 00:30:23,865
UM, I WOULD HAPPILY DO 20%,
BUT FOR MORE CASH.

00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:24,900

00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,968

00:31:23,992 --> 00:31:26,094
IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT MORE SHARKS

I'M SUPER PSYCHED
TO HAVE ROBERT INVOLVED.

WE HAVE LIVED IN NEW YORK CITY
FOR OVER 10 YEARS NOW.

00:32:15,911 --> 00:32:18,813
SO, IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT
WE LOVE A GOOD NEW YORK BAGEL.

THEY'RE SUCH
A COMMITMENT.

A DREAM WOKE ME UP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

OF SOMETHING REVOLUTIONARY.

WITH AN AUTHENTIC
NEW YORK-STYLE BAGEL

AND FINISHED WITH HIGH-QUALITY,
UNIQUE CREAM CHEESES

THAT BANTAM BAGELS
WOULD BE MORE

THAN JUST ANOTHER

BECAUSE IT'S A NOVELTY

ACTUALLY COME BACK?

WHAT DO YOU NEED WITH $275,000?

00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,882
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

00:34:33,882 --> 00:34:35,116
WE'RE LOOKING TO BUILD

00:34:35,116 --> 00:34:37,719
A COMMERCIAL COMMISSARY
BAKING FACILITY

00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,721
SO THAT -- BASICALLY, RIGHT NOW,
IF WE WANT A BAG OF FLOUR,

00:34:39,721 --> 00:34:40,855
THAT'S ALL WE CAN GET.

00:34:40,855 --> 00:34:42,891
WE CAN'T GET
A PALLET OF FLOUR.
RIGHT. I GET IT.

00:34:42,891 --> 00:34:44,159
AND WHAT HAPPENS AFTER YOU --

00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,061
THAT WOULD INCREASE
YOUR CAPACITY BY 25 TIMES.

00:34:46,061 --> 00:34:49,030
NOW WHAT HAPPENS?
MORE STORES?
OKAY.

00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:51,132
WE KNEW AT THE BEGINNING
THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO TRY

00:34:51,132 --> 00:34:53,001
A COUPLE DIFFERENT
STRATEGIC AVENUES.

00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:55,003
SO, WE STARTED OFF THINKING,

00:34:55,003 --> 00:34:57,172
"THIS RETAIL CHANNEL,
THAT'S RIGHT FOR US."

00:34:57,172 --> 00:34:59,941
SO, WE TESTED IT OUT.
WE KILLED IT.

00:34:59,941 --> 00:35:02,143
THE REVENUE WAS INCREDIBLE.

00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:04,913
MARGINS, NOT SO MUCH.
WHY?

00:35:04,913 --> 00:35:06,047
BECAUSE OF THE SEASONALITY

00:35:06,047 --> 00:35:08,049
AND THE UNPREDICTABILITY
OF CUSTOMERS.

00:35:08,049 --> 00:35:09,984
THERE WAS A --
LABOR WAS PRETTY HIGH.

00:35:09,984 --> 00:35:11,953
SO, WE SMARTENED UP

00:35:11,953 --> 00:35:13,088
AND SAID, "WE BETTER TRY
A DIFFERENT CHANNEL."

00:35:13,088 --> 00:35:15,924
WE CLAWED AND SCRATCHED
AND GOT OUR WAY

00:35:15,924 --> 00:35:19,828
INTO SOME PRETTY BIG
WHOLESALE AVENUES,

00:35:19,828 --> 00:35:21,029
WHICH WE HAVE BEEN --
WHO?

00:35:21,029 --> 00:35:24,132
THE, UM --
SO, OUR BIGGEST
WHOLESALE ACCOUNT IS QVC.

00:35:24,132 --> 00:35:25,767
QVC?
QVC?

00:35:25,767 --> 00:35:27,068
HOW WELL ARE YOU SELLING
ON QVC?

00:35:27,068 --> 00:35:29,237
OUR FIRST TIME ON THERE,
WE SOLD OUT IN FIVE MINUTES.

00:35:29,237 --> 00:35:32,140
OKAY. HOW MANY ARE BEING BOUGHT?
WHAT PRICE?

00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,942
WE SOLD A PACK OF 36,

00:35:33,942 --> 00:35:37,178
$17.80 COST TO US,
AND QVC BUYS IT FOR $19.80.

00:35:37,178 --> 00:35:38,913
SO, WE MAKE $2 PER PACK.
WHOA.
OH, LORD.

00:35:38,913 --> 00:35:40,882
THAT SUCKS.
WELCOME TO QVC.
THAT'S ROUGH.

00:35:40,882 --> 00:35:43,785
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT ANYMORE?
YOU DON'T NEED THAT.

00:35:43,785 --> 00:35:45,720
BECAUSE
THERE'S NO BETTER WAY

00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,888
TO GET IN FRONT
OF 8 MILLION PEOPLE.

00:35:46,888 --> 00:35:49,858
LOOK. YOU MAY NOT SPEND
ANY TIME

00:35:49,858 --> 00:35:52,026
DEVELOPING A DISTRIBUTION
STRATEGY OTHER THAN

00:35:52,026 --> 00:35:54,195
DIRECT TO THE CONSUMER BECAUSE
YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO HAVE,

00:35:54,195 --> 00:35:57,098
IF YOU'RE LUCKY,
$275,000 OF CASH.

00:35:57,098 --> 00:35:59,901
THAT LETS YOU SET UP
ONE COMMERCIAL KITCHEN,

00:35:59,901 --> 00:36:02,937
ONE WEBSITE,
AND FOCUS METICULOUSLY ON THAT

00:36:02,937 --> 00:36:07,041
TO GET READY
FOR THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:09,744
OF "SHARK TANK" VIEWERS
WHO ARE GONNA WANT TO TRY THIS.

00:36:09,744 --> 00:36:11,045
EVERYTHING ELSE
IS IRRELEVANT

00:36:11,045 --> 00:36:13,915
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT MAKING
ANY MONEY ON ANYTHING ELSE.

00:36:13,915 --> 00:36:16,050

INVESTED OF YOUR OWN,

00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,752
OF YOUR MONEY,
AND WHERE DID IT COME FROM?

00:36:17,752 --> 00:36:18,987
Nick:
$50,000 OF OUR OWN MONEY.

00:36:18,987 --> 00:36:21,189
AND THEN, YOU KNOW, TO START
THIS, WE HAD TO RAISE MONEY.

00:36:21,189 --> 00:36:22,824
SO, WE'RE BOTH
FROM WALL STREET.

00:36:22,824 --> 00:36:24,759
WHERE DID YOU WORK
ON WALL STREET? WHAT DID YOU DO?

00:36:24,759 --> 00:36:26,795
I WORKED AT MORGAN STANLEY
IN ASSET MANAGEMENT.

00:36:26,795 --> 00:36:28,196
Nick: AND I'M ACTUALLY
STILL CURRENTLY WORKING

00:36:28,196 --> 00:36:29,798
AS A CREDIT BROKER
AT GFI GROUP.

00:36:29,798 --> 00:36:31,132
HOW MUCH DID YOU RAISE
FROM THE OTHER INVESTORS?

00:36:31,132 --> 00:36:32,167
JUST UNDER $600,000.

00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:34,169
AND WHAT DO THEY OWN?

00:36:34,169 --> 00:36:36,204
WE'VE ALLOCATED
23% OF THE COMPANY.

00:36:36,204 --> 00:36:39,908
ARE YOU, NICK, GONNA QUIT
YOUR JOB WHEN YOU HAVE THE BABY?
ABSOLUTELY.

00:36:39,908 --> 00:36:42,177
Herjavec: NICK, DO YOU MAKE
A LOT OF MONEY ON WALL STREET?
I'M JUST CURIOUS.

00:36:42,177 --> 00:36:43,778

WHAT YOU'D SAY IS --

00:36:43,778 --> 00:36:44,979
SIX FIGURES.
YES.

00:36:44,979 --> 00:36:48,850
HONESTLY, I AM SO READY
TO NOT WORK ON WALL STREET.

00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:50,785

TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT.

00:36:50,785 --> 00:36:52,720
HOW ARE YOU GONNA PAY
YOUR RENT?

00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,922
YOU KNOW,
WE HAVE SAVINGS.

00:36:53,922 --> 00:36:55,757
Herjavec: HERE'S MY CHALLENGE
WITH YOU GUYS.

00:36:55,757 --> 00:36:58,026
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE MAKING
THE KIND OF MONEY TODAY

00:36:58,026 --> 00:37:00,929
THAT MOST PEOPLE WHO
COME ON TO THE "TANK"
WOULD ONLY DREAM OF.

00:37:00,929 --> 00:37:03,731
AND THERE'S A LACK
OF DESPERATION

00:37:03,731 --> 00:37:06,768
THAT YOU GET WHEN YOU'RE MAKING
SIX FIGURES AND HAVE MONEY.

00:37:06,768 --> 00:37:08,803
YOU NEED
THAT SENSE OF DESPERATION.

00:37:08,803 --> 00:37:10,104
YOU HAVE A GOLD MINE HERE

00:37:10,104 --> 00:37:11,873
AND YOU'RE TRYING THIS,

00:37:11,873 --> 00:37:13,842
"EH, IT KIND OF DOESN'T WORK.
WE'LL TRY THIS."

00:37:13,842 --> 00:37:15,043
MAN,
WHEN YOU'RE STARTING OUT,

00:37:15,043 --> 00:37:18,046
YOU'VE GOT TO FIND THAT ONE IDEA
AND YOU'VE GOT TO RUN WITH IT.

00:37:18,046 --> 00:37:19,848
YOU'VE GOT TO GO, BABY.

00:37:19,848 --> 00:37:21,015
CAN I SPEAK ABOUT IT
A LITTLE BIT?
AND RESPECTFULLY,

00:37:21,015 --> 00:37:23,918
THAT'S SO DIFFICULT TO HEAR,
BECAUSE IF YOU ONLY KNEW --

00:37:23,918 --> 00:37:27,922
EVERY DOLLAR WE DON'T MAKE
BLEEDS THROUGH OUR SYSTEM.

00:37:27,922 --> 00:37:29,791
WE FEEL IT.
IT HURTS.

00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:32,794
IF YOU THINK, FOR ANY MOMENT,
THAT THIS ISN'T WHO I AM

00:37:32,794 --> 00:37:35,763
AND WHO I'VE POURED
THE LAST YEAR OF MY LIFE INTO,

00:37:35,763 --> 00:37:37,065
THEN I'M JUST NOT
COMMUNICATING WELL TO YOU.

00:37:37,065 --> 00:37:39,767
Cuban:
BUT, ROBERT, IT'S SO WRONG.

00:37:39,767 --> 00:37:41,903
BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING HERE
IS THAT NONE OF US HERE

00:37:41,903 --> 00:37:43,071
CAN BE
GOOD ENTREPRENEURS ANYMORE.

00:37:43,071 --> 00:37:44,973
NO, NO, NO. THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M SAYING AT ALL, MARK.

00:37:44,973 --> 00:37:46,174
WHAT I'M SAYING IS --
WE CAN'T DO A STARTUP?

00:37:46,174 --> 00:37:49,043
WHAT I'M SAYING IS,
THIS IS A FANTASTIC IDEA.

00:37:49,043 --> 00:37:50,845
THEY'RE TRYING
TOO MANY THINGS.

00:37:50,845 --> 00:37:52,780
AND WE'RE WILLING TO LISTEN
TO YOUR INSIGHT.

00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,915
WE'RE COACHABLE.

00:37:53,915 --> 00:37:55,984
YOU KNOW, IF ONE OF YOU
FELT LIKE THIS IS IT,

00:37:55,984 --> 00:37:57,852
THIS IS THE WAY TO GO,
WE TRUST THAT.

00:37:57,852 --> 00:37:59,087
GUYS, THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

00:37:59,087 --> 00:38:01,756
YOU JUST SAID,
"WE'RE COACHABLE."

00:38:01,756 --> 00:38:04,826
YOU DON'T YET KNOW
WHERE THE BEST PLACE TO GO IS.

00:38:04,826 --> 00:38:06,961
I THINK
YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT,

00:38:06,961 --> 00:38:08,930
BUT IT'S GONNA BE EXPENSIVE,
TIME-CONSUMING.

00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:10,899
I DON'T WANT TO BE
IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE

00:38:10,899 --> 00:38:12,100
IN THE BAGEL BUSINESS
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK

00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,768
I CAN PROVIDE THAT DIRECTION
FOR YOU.

00:38:13,768 --> 00:38:15,937
SO, FOR THOSE REASONS, I'M OUT.

00:38:15,937 --> 00:38:17,939
OKAY.

00:38:17,939 --> 00:38:20,808
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA GO THROUGH
A LOT OF DIFFERENT TRIES.

00:38:20,808 --> 00:38:22,810
I CAN'T HELP YOU RIGHT NOW.

00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:24,812
WISH YOU ALL THE BEST.
I'M OUT.

00:38:24,812 --> 00:38:26,781
THANK YOU.

00:38:26,781 --> 00:38:29,717
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
OH.

00:38:32,086 --> 00:38:34,055
I'M REALLY
A PERFECT PARTNER.

00:38:34,055 --> 00:38:36,190
YOU COULDN'T HAVE GONE TO BED
LAST NIGHT

00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,860
AND HAD THE BEST DREAM OF YOUR
LIFE AND NOT HAVE ME IN IT.

00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,762
[ GREINER LAUGHS ]

00:38:40,762 --> 00:38:42,864
IT'S THE TRUTH.
THOSE ARE CALLED NIGHTMARES,
BARB.

00:38:42,864 --> 00:38:45,199
I'VE WALKED
THAT ROAD EXACTLY,

00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:48,069
IN THE SAME PATTERN
AS YOU'RE WALKING IT NOW,

00:38:48,069 --> 00:38:49,237
WITH DAISY CAKE'S.

00:38:49,237 --> 00:38:51,205
I'VE GONE TO HELL AND BACK AGAIN
WITH HER,

00:38:51,205 --> 00:38:52,974
AND I KNOW EVERYTHING
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO.

00:38:52,974 --> 00:38:54,976
BUT I HAVE A FEW THINGS.

00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,878
ONE, YOUR BRAND,
I DON'T LIKE.

00:38:56,878 --> 00:39:00,848
SECONDLY, WOULD YOU BE WILLING
TO DROP QVC

00:39:00,848 --> 00:39:03,751
AT THOSE SKINNY, LITTLE MARGINS
WITH ALL THAT PRESSURE?

00:39:03,751 --> 00:39:05,954
THEY'RE NOT GONNA
LIKE THAT. THEY'RE NOT
GONNA LIKE THAT AT ALL.

00:39:05,954 --> 00:39:08,756
LET THEM DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES,
LORI.
I'M JUST SAYING.

00:39:08,756 --> 00:39:10,191
WE -- WE WOULD BE
WILLING TO.

00:39:10,191 --> 00:39:12,760
Corcoran:
HERE'S MY OFFER.

00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,831
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $275,000,
BUT I WANT 51% OF YOUR GOODS.
OH!

00:39:16,831 --> 00:39:18,900
I'M GONNA TELL YOU
WHY IT'S A GREAT OFFER --

00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,969
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GONNA SUCCEED
WITHOUT ME.

00:39:28,009 --> 00:39:30,712
Narrator:
TWO SHARKS ARE OUT.

00:39:30,712 --> 00:39:32,880
NICK AND ELYSE HAVE AN OFFER
FROM BARBARA --

00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,986
$275,000, BUT FOR 51%
CONTROLLING INTEREST

00:39:37,986 --> 00:39:41,723
OF THEIR MINI-BAGEL COMPANY,
BANTAM BAGELS.

00:39:41,723 --> 00:39:43,825
Corcoran: I'M GONNA TELL YOU
WHY IT'S A GREAT OFFER --

00:39:43,825 --> 00:39:46,728
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GONNA SUCCEED
WITHOUT ME.

00:39:46,728 --> 00:39:49,030
WELL, WE APPRECIATE YOUR OFFER,
BARBARA.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:51,833
O'Leary: ALL RIGHT.
HERE'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

00:39:51,833 --> 00:39:54,769
THERE'S ONLY THREE THINGS THAT
YOU HAVE TO DO TO BE SUCCESSFUL.

00:39:54,769 --> 00:39:56,004
ONE,
YOU HAVE TO QUIT YOUR JOB.

00:39:56,004 --> 00:39:59,941
TWO, YOU HAVE TO DO A COMMERCIAL
KITCHEN -- NOT OWN IT.

00:39:59,941 --> 00:40:01,776
YOU HAVE TO FIND ONE
THAT ALREADY EXISTS.

00:40:01,776 --> 00:40:04,078
YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME
TO BUILD YOUR OWN, OKAY?
RIGHT.

00:40:04,078 --> 00:40:05,780
AND THREE, YOU HAVE TO BE DIRECT
TO CONSUMER.

00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,815
IF YOU DO ALL OF THOSE,

00:40:07,815 --> 00:40:09,851
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $275,000
FOR 50%.

00:40:13,021 --> 00:40:15,757
NOW, THAT'S TWO PEOPLE
IN YOUR BUSINESS...
THAT MAKES NO SENSE!

00:40:15,757 --> 00:40:17,725
...TELLING YOU THAT WE NEED
THAT KIND OF PARTNERSHIP

00:40:17,725 --> 00:40:19,861
TO MAKE THIS MAKE
ANY SENSE.

00:40:19,861 --> 00:40:22,864
O'Leary: YOU WANT TO DO
WHAT WICKED CUPCAKES DID.

00:40:22,864 --> 00:40:24,766
I'M LOOKING AT IT,
SAYING TO MYSELF, "OKAY.

00:40:24,766 --> 00:40:26,901
"BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD ALREADY
WITH WICKED CUPCAKES.

00:40:26,901 --> 00:40:28,002
SAME THING."

00:40:28,002 --> 00:40:30,938
I DO IT AND MAKE MONEY --
LOTS OF MONEY.

00:40:34,175 --> 00:40:36,844
OKAY.
I HAVE AN OFFER.

00:40:37,912 --> 00:40:40,848
BUT I DON'T LIKE THE NAME,
EITHER,

00:40:40,848 --> 00:40:42,817
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
IT DESCRIBES WHAT IT IS.

00:40:42,817 --> 00:40:45,853
AND TO ME, LIKE, CALLING IT,
YOU KNOW, STUFFIN' BAGEL,

00:40:45,853 --> 00:40:48,022
BAGEL STUFFIN'S,
SOMETHING WHERE YOU GET IT.

00:40:48,022 --> 00:40:50,758
THE OTHER THING THAT
I THINK WOULD BE AWESOME,

00:40:50,758 --> 00:40:53,094
I LIKE THE IDEA OF FOOD TRUCKS
FOR YOU.

00:40:53,094 --> 00:40:56,097
A GREAT COFFEE
AND STUFFED BAGELS?

00:40:56,097 --> 00:40:57,965
WHO WOULDN'T WANT THAT?
SO, WHAT'S YOUR OFFER?

00:40:57,965 --> 00:40:59,200
HERE'S MY OFFER.

00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,037
$275,000 FOR 30%.

00:41:06,107 --> 00:41:08,810
GUYS, YOU GOT TO MAKE A DECISION
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.

00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:10,945
Nick: OKAY.

00:41:10,945 --> 00:41:13,981
WELL, BARBARA,
WE APPRECIATE YOUR OFFER,

00:41:13,981 --> 00:41:16,718
BUT THERE'S NO WAY
WITH WHAT WE'VE PUT IN

00:41:16,718 --> 00:41:17,952
AND WHERE WE SEE
THIS BUSINESS GOING

00:41:17,952 --> 00:41:20,088
THAT WE CAN GIVE UP
51% OF THE COMPANY.

00:41:20,088 --> 00:41:23,057
MAKE ME A COUNTER OFFER.

00:41:24,759 --> 00:41:28,096
I COULD SO HELP YOU.

00:41:28,096 --> 00:41:30,064
I'M GONNA WALK YOU
THROUGH THE BAKERIES.

00:41:30,064 --> 00:41:31,999
I KNOW THE BAD GUYS,
THE GOOD GUYS,

00:41:31,999 --> 00:41:34,736
THE GUYS WHO RIP YOU OFF,
THE GUYS WHO STEAL YOUR RECIPES.

00:41:34,736 --> 00:41:36,003
WE ALL HAVE EXPERIENCE

00:41:36,003 --> 00:41:37,939
THAT'S GOING TO HELP YOU
NO MATTER WHAT.

00:41:37,939 --> 00:41:40,842
THE ONLY QUESTION IS, ARE
YOU GOING TO MAKE A COUNTER
OFFER TO 51% OR NOT?

00:41:43,111 --> 00:41:45,713
UM, WOULD YOU BE WILLING
TO GO DOWN TO 25%?

00:41:45,713 --> 00:41:48,716
WELL, IN ALL THE TIME
THAT WE JUST SAT HERE

00:41:48,716 --> 00:41:50,885
AND I'VE HAD MY OFFER
OUT THERE --
WOULD YOU MIND?
I'M GOING TO --

00:41:50,885 --> 00:41:52,720
LORI, I DON'T WANT TO --
I'M THINKING TO MYSELF,

00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,789
"WE COULD HAVE SOLD
$100,000 WORTH ON QVC."

00:41:54,789 --> 00:41:57,992
WOULD YOU --
WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN 25%?

00:41:57,992 --> 00:41:59,160
I'LL GIVE YOU 1/3.

00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,195
I WOULD IF YOU DECIDE RIGHT NOW
WITH ME.

00:42:01,195 --> 00:42:03,731
YOU'RE DONE.
YOU HAVE A DEAL.

00:42:03,731 --> 00:42:05,767
ALL RIGHT. YAY.

00:42:05,767 --> 00:42:07,101
I LOVE THESE THINGS.
OH, AMAZING.

00:42:07,101 --> 00:42:09,070
THESE THINGS
ARE AWESOME.
WE LOVE YOU.

00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:12,206
DOGGONE.
CONGRATS, GUYS.

00:42:12,206 --> 00:42:14,976
I THOUGHT
I WAS GONNA GET IT.

00:42:16,043 --> 00:42:17,745
Nick:
I THINK WE MADE A GREAT DEAL.

00:42:17,745 --> 00:42:19,847
WE WENT IN WITH A NUMBER
THAT WE WERE WILLING TO ACCEPT

00:42:19,847 --> 00:42:21,749
WITH THE RIGHT PARTNER
AND THE RIGHT SHARK,

00:42:21,749 --> 00:42:24,152
AND SOMEHOW THE STARS ALIGNED
AND WE GOT ALL OF IT.
