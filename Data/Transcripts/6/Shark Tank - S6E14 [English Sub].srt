AND I'M SETH FRIEDMAN,

00:14:44,368 --> 00:14:46,470
AND WE ARE THE CREATORS
OF BOTTLE BRIGHT.

00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,573
WE'RE HERE TODAY SEEKING
$75,000

00:14:49,573 --> 00:14:51,875
IN EXCHANGE FOR 15%
OF OUR COMPANY.

00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:57,748
SHARKS, THERE ARE ALL KINDS
OF PORTABLE DRINKING CONTAINERS

00:14:57,748 --> 00:15:00,651
THAT MAKE OUR LIVES EASIER.

00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:04,621
THE PROBLEM IS, THEY DEVELOP
STAINS AND ODORS EASILY.

00:15:04,621 --> 00:15:06,657
AND THE TYPICAL METHODS
FOR CLEANING THEM

00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:08,792
JUST DON'T WORK WELL.

00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:12,529
DISHWASHERS CAN'T SPRAY
INTO NARROW OPENINGS,

00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:15,799
AND MANY DRINKING CONTAINERS
AREN'T DISHWASHER-SAFE.

00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:18,869
CHLORINE BLEACH
AND OTHER HARSH CHEMICALS

00:15:18,869 --> 00:15:21,638
ARE TOXIC AND DANGEROUS.

00:15:21,638 --> 00:15:24,508
WE WERE FRUSTRATED BY
THE LACK OF SUITABLE METHODS

00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:26,643
TO CLEAN OUR PORTABLE
DRINKWEAR.

00:15:26,643 --> 00:15:29,513
WE WERE LOOKING FOR A SOLUTION
THAT WAS EASY TO USE,

00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:31,548
SAFE, AND EFFECTIVE.

00:15:31,548 --> 00:15:34,751
THAT'S WHY WE CREATED
BOTTLE BRIGHT.

00:15:34,751 --> 00:15:37,588
BOTTLE BRIGHT IS AN EFFERVESCENT
CLEANING TABLET

00:15:37,588 --> 00:15:41,625
THAT IS <i>AMAZING</i>
AT REMOVING STAINS AND ODORS

00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:42,793
FROM PORTABLE DRINKWEAR.

00:15:42,793 --> 00:15:45,629
AND IT'S SO EASY TO USE.

00:15:45,629 --> 00:15:48,398
SIMPLY FILL YOUR BOTTLE
WITH WATER,

00:15:48,398 --> 00:15:52,636
DROP IN A BOTTLE BRIGHT TABLET,
AND LET IT GO TO WORK.

00:15:52,636 --> 00:15:55,739
THEN DISCARD THE SOLUTION,
GIVE IT A QUICK RINSE,

00:15:55,739 --> 00:15:58,876
AND YOUR BOTTLE IS FRESH
AND CLEAN.

00:15:58,876 --> 00:16:02,446
SHARKS, WE ARE COMMITTED
TO MAKING BOTTLE BRIGHT

00:16:02,446 --> 00:16:03,680
A HOUSEHOLD NAME.

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,750
WE NEED YOUR EXPERTISE
IN GETTING OUR UNIQUE PRODUCT

00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,585
INTO THE HANDS
OF CONSUMERS.

00:16:08,585 --> 00:16:11,421
SO, WHO WOULD LIKE
TO JOIN US

00:16:11,421 --> 00:16:14,458
IN SOLVING THE DIRTY BOTTLE
DILEMMA?

00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,526
LET ME PASS OUT SOME SAMPLES
FOR YOU TO LOOK AT.

00:16:16,526 --> 00:16:18,428
IT'S LIKE EFFERDENT
FOR YOUR BOTTLE. [ LAUGHS ]

00:16:18,428 --> 00:16:20,430
I THINK THE BIGGEST
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IT

00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,765
AND SOMETHING LIKE
EFFERDENT

00:16:21,765 --> 00:16:23,533
IS THIS IS AN ALL-NATURAL
PRODUCT.
Lori: ALL-NATURAL.

00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:25,402
WHAT'S IN THAT TABLET?

00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:26,904
TH-THEY'RE ALL-NATURAL
INGREDIENTS,

00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:29,840
BUT THEY'RE ALL MINERAL-BASED
OR ORGANIC-BASED.

00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,709
DOES IT HAVE ANY ODOR
WHEN I -- AFTERWARDS?

00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:35,879
NONE.
ABSOLUTELY NO ODOR
OR RESIDUAL SMELL.

00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:37,814
GUYS, I'M GONNA BET THAT
YOU HAVE VERY LITTLE SALES

00:16:37,814 --> 00:16:40,417
'CAUSE NOBODY GIVES A DAMN.
[ LAUGHS ] YEAH.

00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:43,420
[ LAUGHTER ]
I-I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE
GIVE A DAMN,

00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,690
BUT WE HAVE VERY LITTLE SALES.
SO HALF YOUR COMMENT IS CORRECT.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,525
TELL US ABOUT YOUR SALES.
Kevin: WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?

00:16:48,525 --> 00:16:50,560
UM, LAST YEAR WE DID
$110,000.

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,562
THIS YEAR WE'RE
AT $85,000.

00:16:52,562 --> 00:16:53,797
WELL, THAT'S NOT "NO SALES."
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

00:16:53,797 --> 00:16:55,565
SETH, HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN DOING IT?

00:16:55,565 --> 00:16:56,800
UH, WE STARTED
THREE YEARS AGO.

00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,602
WE HAVE
PRIVATE LABEL CUSTOMERS.

00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:00,637
WE'RE DEALING WITH TWO
VERY LARGE COMPANIES

00:17:00,637 --> 00:17:02,839
THAT WE'RE NOW PRIVATE-LABELING
THIS SAME FORMULA FOR.

00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:04,875
I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR.
WHEN YOU PRIVATE-LABEL IT,

00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,843
THERE'S NO BRAND FOR YOU.

00:17:06,843 --> 00:17:09,646
THEY'RE SIMPLY USING IT
AS PART OF THEIR PRODUCT.

00:17:09,646 --> 00:17:11,615
SO I GO TO THEM,
I BUY THE PRODUCT.

00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:14,451
YOU COME ALONG WITH IT.
IS THAT RIGHT?

00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:17,621
YEAH, WE MANUFACTURE FOR THEM.
IT'S UNDER THEIR BRAND.

00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:21,391
AND I BET YOU'RE MAKING HUNDREDS
OF DOLLARS DOING THAT.
[ LAUGHING ]

00:17:21,391 --> 00:17:23,660
WELL, WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT --
WHAT DOES THE PRODUCT COST?
THE PRODUCT HAS GREAT MARGINS.

00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,829
YES.
WHAT DOES IT COST, AND WHAT
DO YOU SELL IT FOR?

00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:27,831
SO WE BUILD THE -- WE BUILD
THE 10-PACK POUCH

00:17:27,831 --> 00:17:29,833
RIGHT THERE FOR 79 CENTS.

00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:32,602
WE WHOLESALE IT FOR $2.99
TO RETAIL.

00:17:32,602 --> 00:17:35,539
AND -- AND -- AND THEN THEY
SELL IT FOR $5.99.

00:17:35,539 --> 00:17:37,441
WHAT'S THE REST OF YOUR STORY?

00:17:37,441 --> 00:17:39,443
LIKE, WHY DID YOU
COME UP WITH THIS?
SURE.

00:17:39,443 --> 00:17:40,744
SO WE'RE MOUNTAIN BIKERS.

00:17:40,744 --> 00:17:42,412
AND WE FINISHED A DAY
OF MOUNTAIN BIKING.

00:17:42,412 --> 00:17:44,481
WE USE HYDRATION PACKS
MUCH LIKE YOU SEE THERE

00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,717
WITH THE HOSE, AND I FINISHED
THAT RIDE THAT DAY,

00:17:46,717 --> 00:17:48,418
PULLED UP TO THE TRAIL HEAD
AND SAID TO JUSTIN,

00:17:48,418 --> 00:17:49,453
"THIS THING TASTES DISGUSTING."

00:17:49,453 --> 00:17:50,654
'CAUSE THEY'RE IMPOSSIBLE
TO CLEAN.

00:17:50,654 --> 00:17:53,457
SO WE HAD THAT ISSUE.
I SAID TO JUSTIN,

00:17:53,457 --> 00:17:54,691
"I'M LEADING
A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE,

00:17:54,691 --> 00:17:56,426
"AND I'M DUMPING BLEACH
IN HERE.

00:17:56,426 --> 00:17:57,561
"AND NOW IT TASTES LIKE
A SWIMMING POOL

00:17:57,561 --> 00:17:58,662
"AND I'M KILLING MYSELF.

00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:00,564
LET'S COME UP WITH
AN ALL-NATURAL SOLUTION."

00:18:00,564 --> 00:18:03,467
SO JUST TO GO BACK, YOU DID
$110,000 IN SALES.

00:18:03,467 --> 00:18:05,569
MM-HMM.
PRIVATE LABEL TO TWO COMPANIES.

00:18:05,569 --> 00:18:07,671
YES.
DID YOU MAKE ANY MONEY
ON THAT?

00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:10,407
WE DID NOT. WE HAD A ROUGH 2013,
TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST WITH YOU.

00:18:10,407 --> 00:18:12,442
OKAY. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

00:18:12,442 --> 00:18:13,877
WE HAD A $100,000 LOSS
THAT YEAR.

00:18:13,877 --> 00:18:15,846
WHOA!

00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:18,749
LAST YEAR, ABOUT, UH,
JULY 2013,

00:18:18,749 --> 00:18:21,785
WE DID A LARGE RUN FOR ONE OF
OUR PRIVATE LABEL COMPANIES.

00:18:21,785 --> 00:18:23,720
AND WE WERE TRYING TO PUSH
THE BOUNDARIES

00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,655
OF ECOLOGICAL PACKAGING.

00:18:25,655 --> 00:18:29,593
THEY WANTED A FILM THAT WAS
BIODEGRADABLE.

00:18:29,593 --> 00:18:32,662
WE SENT THEM
A LARGE AMOUNT OF PRODUCT,

00:18:32,662 --> 00:18:35,499
AND THERE WAS MOISTURE VAPOR
THAT WAS STARTING TO

00:18:35,499 --> 00:18:38,735
PENETRATE THROUGH THE PRODUCT
AND DEGRADE THE TABLETS.

00:18:38,735 --> 00:18:41,505
SO YOU DID A RECALL?
YOU TOOK IT BACK?
WE REPLACED IT. WE TOOK IT BACK.

00:18:41,505 --> 00:18:43,774
WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BEST
TO TAKE THE ENTIRE THING BACK --

00:18:43,774 --> 00:18:45,675
AND YOU LOST $100,000
ON THAT.

00:18:45,675 --> 00:18:47,544
PAINFUL YEAR.

00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:48,678
YOU'RE VERY LUCKY
YOU'VE MET ME TODAY,

00:18:48,678 --> 00:18:49,813
AND I'M GONNA TELL YOU WHY.

00:18:49,813 --> 00:18:52,582
I'M ALSO A CLEANER.
I'M THE WONDERFUL CLEANER.

00:18:52,582 --> 00:18:55,786
I CLEAN REALLY BAD IDEAS
RIGHT OUT OF THE SHARK TANK,

00:18:55,786 --> 00:18:57,587
AND THIS FALLS UNDER
THAT CATEGORY.

00:18:57,587 --> 00:18:58,855
YOU SPENT OVER THREE YEARS
DOING THIS,

00:18:58,855 --> 00:19:00,557
IT'S STILL NOT PROFITABLE,

00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:02,526
AND YET YOU CLAIM
YOU'RE ENTREPRENEURS.

00:19:02,526 --> 00:19:04,494
AT SOME POINT,
A SUCCESSFUL ENTREPRENEUR KNOWS

00:19:04,494 --> 00:19:06,696
THEY HAVE A LOSER,
AND THEY SHOOT IT.

00:19:06,696 --> 00:19:09,399
KEVIN, I SENSE YOU'RE GONNA
MAKE AN OFFER.

00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:11,701
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU AN OFFER
TO THINK IT THROUGH,

00:19:11,701 --> 00:19:14,404
LEAVE HERE, AND SHOOT IT.

00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:16,673
BY THE WAY, I'M OUT.

00:19:16,673 --> 00:19:18,708
SETH, HERE'S MY -- HERE'S
MY CHALLENGE WITH IT. LOOK.

00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,677
YOU HAVEN'T PROVEN ANY DEMAND.

00:19:20,677 --> 00:19:23,547
I THINK ANYBODY THAT TRULY CARES
ENOUGH ABOUT CLEANING

00:19:23,547 --> 00:19:25,816
THEIR WATER BOTTLE
ALREADY HAS AN OPTION.

00:19:25,816 --> 00:19:27,784
YOU'RE DOING IT BETTER
POTENTIALLY,

00:19:27,784 --> 00:19:30,654
BUT THAT IS GONNA BE
A REAL CHALLENGE

00:19:30,654 --> 00:19:34,758
TO GET THAT CONSUMER
TO CARE THAT MUCH MORE.

00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:36,693
I -- WHEN YOU'RE SPENDING $40 --
I DON'T SEE THE DIRECTION.

00:19:36,693 --> 00:19:37,694
I UNDERSTAND.
I'M OUT.

00:19:40,397 --> 00:19:43,733
WHAT WAS YOUR PLAN TO DO
WITH THE $75,000?

00:19:43,733 --> 00:19:45,469
WHY DO YOU NEED IT?

00:19:45,469 --> 00:19:47,871
$75,000 WE FEEL
IS HELPFUL FOR ADMINISTRATION.

00:19:47,871 --> 00:19:50,807
TO ME, THE WORST WASTE OF MONEY

00:19:50,807 --> 00:19:52,709
IS FOR IT TO GO
TO ADMINISTRATION

00:19:52,709 --> 00:19:56,580
WHEN YOU'VE GOT TWO PEOPLE THAT
SHOULD BE REAL FIRECRACKERS

00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,615
OUT THERE, YOU KNOW,
BURNING THE MIDNIGHT OIL,

00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:00,617
WORKING MORNING, NOON,
AND NIGHT TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.

00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:03,620
IF YOU WERE TO INVEST WITH US,
I'D BE COMPLETELY OPEN-MINDED

00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,723
TO ANY IDEA YOU HAD AND WHAT
WE SHOULD DO WITH THAT MONEY.

00:20:06,723 --> 00:20:10,427
THERE'S A LARGER ISSUE HERE
THAT IS VERY DISTURBING TO ME.

00:20:10,427 --> 00:20:12,796
I THINK YOU CREATED A...
AN ENORMOUS MISTRUST

00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:17,601
IN MY MIND WHEN YOU SAID
YOU LOST $100,000 IN YEAR 3.

00:20:17,601 --> 00:20:21,438
NOTHING'S WRONG WITH LOSING
$100,000 IN YEAR 1,

00:20:21,438 --> 00:20:23,440
BUT THEN EVERYBODY LIKES TO SEE

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,576
SALES START TO GET SOME TRACTION
AND GO UP.

00:20:26,576 --> 00:20:27,744
I'M OUT.

00:20:27,744 --> 00:20:30,480
I APPRECIATE THAT.

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,781
YOU HAD A GREAT IDEA.
RIGHT?

00:20:31,781 --> 00:20:34,518
YOU TURNED IT INTO WHAT LOOKS
LIKE A GOOD PRODUCT.

00:20:34,518 --> 00:20:36,686
BUT WHAT YOU DON'T HAVE
IS A COMPANY.

00:20:36,686 --> 00:20:39,556
AND WHAT'S EVEN WORSE IS
YOU COME ACROSS

00:20:39,556 --> 00:20:40,824
AS BEING DESPERATE.

00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:42,859
RIGHT? EVERYTHING
THAT YOU'VE SAID

00:20:42,859 --> 00:20:45,362
IS LIKE YOU'RE DROWNING

00:20:45,362 --> 00:20:47,397
AND YOU'RE TRYING TO PUSH
FOR A LIFELINE.

00:20:47,397 --> 00:20:49,566
JUST TO BE CLEAR, IT'S NOT
DESPERATION, IT'S PASSION.

00:20:49,566 --> 00:20:51,535
WE HAVE PASSION
FOR THIS PRODUCT.
I CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE.

00:20:51,535 --> 00:20:54,804
AND WHEN I SENSE DESPERATION,
THAT'S A HUGE NEGATIVE.

00:20:54,804 --> 00:20:57,474
I DON'T INVEST IN DESPERATION.

00:20:57,474 --> 00:20:58,775
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.

00:21:01,411 --> 00:21:03,613
I DON'T AGREE WITH A LOT OF
THE COMMENTS

00:21:03,613 --> 00:21:05,448
THAT HAVE BEEN MADE UP HERE.

00:21:05,448 --> 00:21:09,686
UM, I THINK THAT THIS IS
A SOLUTION TO A BIG PROBLEM.

00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:12,756
SO I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER.

00:21:12,756 --> 00:21:15,492
ARE YOU KIDDING?

00:21:15,492 --> 00:21:18,395
I HAVE A BIG INITIATIVE WITH
BED BATH &amp; BEYOND RIGHT NOW,

00:21:18,395 --> 00:21:19,796
AND I CAN HELP YOU A GREAT DEAL
WITH THAT

00:21:19,796 --> 00:21:22,532
AND WITH MANY OTHER RETAILERS
TO GET IN.

00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:24,601
SO HERE'S MY OFFER.

00:21:24,601 --> 00:21:27,637
I'M GONNA OFFER YOU
THE $75,000,

00:21:27,637 --> 00:21:30,473
BUT I WANT 35%

00:21:30,473 --> 00:21:35,612
AND A CONDITION THAT THE MONEY
WILL GO TOWARDS FUNDING

00:21:35,612 --> 00:21:37,414
ALL THE PURCHASE ORDERS.

00:21:37,414 --> 00:21:40,417
I DON'T WANT IT TO GO TO ADMIN.

00:21:40,417 --> 00:21:43,520
AND I KNOW I HAVE DIRECT
TARGETS FOR US TO GET THIS IN.

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,522
IN RETAIL AND ON QVC,

00:21:45,522 --> 00:21:48,658
THIS WILL HELP TO GIVE
YOURSELF FREE ADVERTISING

00:21:48,658 --> 00:21:50,694
SO PEOPLE KNOW WHAT
THE PRODUCT IS

00:21:50,694 --> 00:21:51,828
WHEN THEY WALK INTO
BED BATH &amp; BEYOND

00:21:51,828 --> 00:21:53,530
AND THEY SEE IT.

00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:54,664
SO THAT'S MY OFFER.

00:21:54,664 --> 00:21:56,466
THANK YOU.
APPRECIATE THE OFFER.

00:21:56,466 --> 00:21:57,634
THANK YOU. YEAH,
APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH.

00:21:57,634 --> 00:22:00,770
WOULD -- WOULD YOU BE WILLING
TO DO 25%?

00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:03,540
ARE YOU KIDDING?

00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:08,411
I WOULD BE WILLING TO DO
33 AND 1/3.

00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:09,546
FINAL OFFER.

00:22:12,649 --> 00:22:14,417
SOUNDS GOOD, LORI.

00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:15,552
