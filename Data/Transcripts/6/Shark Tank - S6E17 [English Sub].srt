BUT MY DOG DIDN'T.

IT'S GOOD TO BE RUTHLESS

00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:23,056
AND MEAN IN BUSINESS.
YES, IT IS. YES, IT IS.

00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:25,325
BUT I'VE FOUND THAT IT'S ALSO
VERY GOOD TO BE NICE.

00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:27,461
IF YOU WANT THE DISCOUNT

00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:30,130
I'M NOT A PILOT FISH,
GOSH DARN IT!

00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,366

MUST GET THE FULL AMOUNT

THEY'RE ASKING FOR,

00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,969
OR THEY'LL WALK AWAY
WITH NOTHING.

HOW DID YOU COME UP
WITH THIS IDEA?

00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,105
AND WHO ACTUALLY CARES?

00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:39,973

THREE MONTHS
AFTER MEETING EACH OTHER,

00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:58,986
AND THEN CORRINA GOT OFFERED
A JOB IN FLORIDA,

00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:01,254
SO WE DECIDED
THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY

00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:02,322
TO START SOMETHING NEW.

00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,191
WE MOVED FROM A HOUSE
WITH A BACKYARD

00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:06,026
INTO A CONDO
WITH A SMALL BALCONY.

00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:08,195
IT WAS REALLY HARD
ON MY DOG, CHLOE.

00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:09,329
I DIDN'T HAVE A JOB.

00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:12,332
I WAS APPLYING FOR JOBS,
AND NOTHING WAS HAPPENING.

00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:13,467
AND THEN I FOUND OUT

MY WIFE WAS PREGNANT.
[ CHUCKLES ]

00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,336

00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,405
AND FIND A WAY
TO PROVIDE FOR MY FAMILY.

00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:21,008
I CAME UP WITH AN INVENTION
FOR CHLOE

00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:24,111
THAT SHE TOOK TO REALLY WELL,
SO I DECIDED TO TURN THAT IDEA

00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:25,212
INTO A BUSINESS.

00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:27,981
FINANCIALLY, I'M ALL IN.

00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,484
I NEED THE SHARKS' EXPERTISE
AS MUCH AS THEIR CAPITAL

00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,020
IF I'M GONNA BE
ABLE TO PULL THIS OFF.

00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,489
MY FAMILY'S FUTURE
DEPENDS ON THIS BUSINESS,

00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:39,292

I LIVE IN DAVENPORT, FLORIDA,

AND I'M THE FOUNDER
OF FRESH PATCH.

00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,989
I'M SEEKING $150,000
FOR A 10% STAKE IN MY COMPANY.

EXCEPT THEIR OWN BACKYARD.

00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:19,299
FOUR YEARS AGO,
MY WIFE AND I AND MY DOG, CHLOE,

00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:22,335
MOVED FROM A HOUSE
WITH A BACKYARD INTO A CONDO.

00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:24,271
NOW, FOR A DOG,
THERE'S NOTHING WORSE

00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:26,173
THAN NOT HAVING
YOUR OWN BACKYARD.

00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:27,974
I WAS BUSY BUILDING

00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:30,377
AND MAINTAINING
A MINI-BACKYARD ON MY BALCONY.

00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:34,181

[ LAUGHS ]

00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:38,085
MY DOG ABSOLUTELY LOVED
THAT GRASSY AREA I HAD CREATED.

00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:41,154
THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THE GRASS
WOULD EVENTUALLY DIE OFF,

00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,056
AND MAINTAINING IT
BECAME A CHORE.

00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,258
AND THAT IS WHERE THE IDEA
FOR FRESH PATCH WAS BORN.

00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:49,362
WE ARE THE FIRST REAL-GRASS
DELIVERY SERVICE OF ITS KIND,

00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:52,332

THERE'S NO MESS.

THE OLD ONE AWAY.

WHO USE IT WITH
ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF PETS.

00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:09,116
IT'S EASY, IT'S CONVENIENT,
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY,

00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:10,450
THE ANIMALS LOVE IT.

00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,253

SOME OF THIS GREEN GRASS

00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:20,093
ANDREW,
YOU HAD IT ON YOUR BALCONY.

00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,062
I DID.
WHAT IF I BRING IT
INTO MY APARTMENT,

00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:23,430
IN AN ENCLOSED
ENVIRONMENT?

00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,266
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE
BEFORE IT HAS AN ODOR?

00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,367
IT'S A LIVING PLANT,

00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,269
SO IT NATURALLY
BREAKS DOWN ODORS.

00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,138
IT DOESN'T SMELL.

00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:32,339

LITTLE PAPER THINGS
THAT YOU CAN LAY DOWN...

00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:36,042
BUT DOGS
KNOW THE DIFFERENCE, RIGHT?

00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,410
...THAT SMALL DOGS
ARE TRAINED TO GO ON.

00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,279
RIGHT. PEE PADS. AND EVERYONE
KNOWS WHAT PEE PADS --

00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,314
PEE PADS.
BUT NO ONE LIKES PEE PADS.
PETS DON'T LIKE PEE PADS.

00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,984
DOGS DON'T LIKE PEE PADS.
THEY TEAR THEM UP.
THEY'RE CONFUSING TO USE.

00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:45,385
THIS IS INSTINCTIVE
TO DOGS.

00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,053
THERE'S NO TRAINING
INVOLVED.

00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:49,456
WHAT IF I HAVE
A REALLY BIG DOG?

00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:52,092
LET ME SHOW YOU
THE FRESH PATCH XL.

00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:56,163

THE FRESH PATCH XL.

YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING.
GOOD FOR YOU. GOOD FOR YOU.
THAT'S AWESOME.

00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,042
ANDREW,
THAT'S AMAZING.

00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,244
IS THAT ALL ONLINE SALES,
OR DO YOU SELL IN ANY OTHER WAY?

00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,146
IT'S ALL ONLINE.
WE'RE DIRECT TO THE CUSTOMER.

00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,147
THAT'S EVEN BETTER.

00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,183
SO, ANDREW,
YOU MUST HAVE

AND NEVER USE IT AGAIN?

WILL STICK WITH IT.

TWO OUT OF THREE CUSTOMERS

00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:43,310
WHO ORDER FROM YOU
DON'T ORDER AGAIN?
CORRECT.

00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,012
THAT'S A BIG NUMBER.
YEAH, THAT CONCERNED ME,
TOO, BARBARA.

00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,316
SO, YOU'RE ONLY ONLINE
RIGHT NOW, RIGHT?
CORRECT.

00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:52,219

TOGETHER AND SHIP EVERYTHING?

THESE BOXES OF GRASS COME IN
JUST UNDER $5, INCLUDING LABOR.

00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:56,356
THEN THE SHIPPING --

00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,191
ON THE WEST COAST,
YOU'RE LOOKING AT $7 TO $8.

00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,392
WHEN WE'RE SHIPPING THESE
TO NEW YORK,

00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:02,028
YOU'RE LOOKING AT $14, $15.

00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,231
AND THAT'S WHY YOU USE
A SHIP STATION IN ORDER TO --
WHO PAYS THE SHIPPING?

00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:06,166
I DO.
SO, THAT'S WHAT'S KILLED
YOUR MARGINS.

'CAUSE IT COULD BE $19
ON A $25 SALE PRICE, RIGHT?

AND WHO'S DOING
ALL THE TECHNOLOGY FOR YOU?

00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:13,306

WITH THE IDEA FOR THIS

00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:16,109
THE DAY AFTER I FOUND OUT
MY WIFE WAS PREGNANT.

00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:18,044
THAT'LL MAKE YOU
GO TO WORK.
IT'S CRAZY.

00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,212
SO IT WAS LIKE
AN INSPIRATION FOR IT.

00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,347
I LEARNED HOW TO BUILD
A WEBSITE.

00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:23,116
I DID THE TRADEMARK.
YOU KNOW, I DO CUSTOMER SERVICE.

00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,252

THEY'RE SOURCED
FROM CALIFORNIA.

00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,181

I'M MORE INTERESTED NOW
THAT THERE'S SOMEBODY I CAN SUE.

00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:27,147
Cuban:
NO KIDDING, RIGHT?

00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:28,114
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,349
YOU KNOW,
THAT'S INTERESTING.

00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:31,451
BECAUSE AT SOME POINT,
UM, IF YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL,

00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,321
YOU CAN GET THEIR CUSTOMERS
AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT.
EXACTLY.

00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,294
LET ME MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
BECAUSE I LIKE IT.

00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,997
I JUST THINK IT'S SO SIMPLE,
AND IT COULD GROW,

00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:47,033
AND THERE'S A LOT I COULD DO
TO HELP YOU.

00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,235
I'LL GIVE YOU $150,000
FOR 33 1/3%.

00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,339
JUST A STRAIGHT OFFER?
STRAIGHT UP, STRAIGHT UP.

00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:53,340
DAMN.

00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,442
I REALLY THINK
THIS COMPANY IS WORTH --

00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:59,079
I KNOW THIS COMPANY
IS WORTH SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT.
WELL, DO YOU HAVE
ANY FLEXIBILITY

00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,947
ON THE EQUITY
YOU'RE WILLING TO PART WITH?

00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,216
I REALLY DON'T.

00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,318
I WANTED TO COME IN HERE
AND GIVE YOU GUYS

00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,187
A GOOD VALUATION
ON THIS COMPANY.

00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:09,289
10% IS NOT A LOT.
10% IS NOT A LOT, ANDREW.

00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:11,191
IT'S TOO EARLY FOR YOU
TO GIVE ANYONE A COUNTEROFFER.

00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:12,993
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD
THE OFFERS.
THAT'S TRUE.

00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,194
THANK YOU, BARBARA.

00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:16,363
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER --

00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:20,200
$150,000 FOR 20%,
BUT THERE'S ONE CONTINGENCY.

00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,304
YOU HAVE TO COMMIT TO BRINGING
THIS INTO THE PET SHOPS.

00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:26,172
YOU WANT TO GO
TO RETAIL?
DEFINITELY.

00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,075
I KNOW THE PET SPACE
INSIDE AND OUT

00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,144
BECAUSE I BOUGHT A BUSINESS
NAMED RYAN'S BARKERY,

00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:33,346
AND I HAD TO BUILD ALL THOSE
BRIDGES INTO THOSE STORES.

00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:37,017
BUT I KNOW ALL THOSE PEOPLE.
I HAVE SUCH GREAT RELATIONSHIPS.

00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:40,387
I THINK THEY WOULD CLEARLY
ORDER THIS PRODUCT AND SELL IT.

00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:42,422
SO I'LL GIVE YOU
THE MONEY YOU'RE ASKING FOR,

00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:44,024
BUT I MUST HAVE 20%,

00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,992
AND YOU MUST COMMIT
TO BRINGING IT INTO RETAIL.

00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,397
I'M GONNA DROP MY ASK ON EQUITY
DOWN TO 20%

00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:53,333
AND REMOVE THAT COVENANT
REGARDING RETAIL.

00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,069
'CAUSE IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME
THAT THAT'S A GOOD STRATEGY.

00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:58,038
IT'S PERISHABLE.
I DON'T LIKE THAT.

00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:04,044
DO YOU KNOW WHY EVERYBODY'S
GONNA BUY THIS IN A STORE?

00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,346
BECAUSE EVERYBODY WHO HAS A PET
IN THE CITY FEELS GUILTY.

00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:09,282
IF THEY COULD BRING
A NICE SLAB OF GREEN GRASS

00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,284
HOME TO THE DOG
THEY'RE IGNORING

00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,253
AND NOT EVER TAKING
TO THE PARK,

00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:14,387
THEY'RE GONNA FEEL SO GOOD.

00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,356
IT'S A FEEL-GOOD PRODUCT
MORE THAN IT IS

00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:18,324
A PRODUCTIVE PRODUCT
FOR HELPING THE DOG.

00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:19,225
CORRECT.

00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:24,030
I KNOW THE HUGE VALUE
OF THIS,

00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,266
AND I THINK YOU'RE JUST
AT THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.

00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:28,968
I REALLY AM.
'CAUSE GOING
INTO THE EAST COAST,

00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:31,371
I THINK THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE
REALLY GONNA RAMP UP HUGE

00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:34,441
BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO
WALK THEIR DOGS IN THE WINTER.

00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:37,977
I LIKE THAT YOU PRICED IT
AT A GOOD PRICE.

00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:41,147
SO I'M THINKING
ABOUT THIS.

00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:44,217
YOU CAME IN WANTING
$150,000 FOR 10%?

00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:45,185
CORRECT.

00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:47,087
I'M THINKING
FOR A MINUTE.

00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,122
I'M GONNA WAIT TO HEAR
WHAT MARK SAYS.

00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:51,991
OKAY.
YOU'RE SITTING BACK,
WAITING IN THE WINGS.

00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,359
I ALWAYS DO.

00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,462
SO, HERE'S WHAT I SEE.

00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:57,097
I AGREE WITH BARBARA

00:09:57,097 --> 00:10:00,066
THAT IT IS A RETAIL PLAY
IN MAJOR VERTICAL CITIES.

00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,201
BUT I ALSO SEE IT
AS A TECH PLAY,

00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:02,402
WHICH IS
THE MOST INTERESTING TO ME.

00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:04,404
SO YOU'RE LEAVING
A TON OF MONEY ON THE TABLE,

00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:06,172
AND YOU KNOW IT, RIGHT?
I AGREE.

00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:09,042
SO, I WANT TO PARTNER
WITH BARBARA ON THIS.
I ALREADY SAID YES.

00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:10,410
WHAT WE'VE LEARNED
OVER THE YEARS

00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,979
IS THAT WE EACH HAVE
OUR OWN SKILL SETS.

00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,981
SO, TECHNOLOGY
TENDS TO BE MINE,

00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:16,382
AND BARBARA DOES A GREAT JOB
AT RETAIL,

00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,251
PARTICULARLY
WITHIN NEW YORK CITY.

00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,320
WHAT WE DO IS,
WE'LL TAKE OVER YOUR ACCOUNTING.

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,089
WE'LL TAKE OVER YOUR WEBSITE
AND ACCELERATE YOUR GROWTH

00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,191
SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEAL
WITH ANY OF THAT.

00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:26,326
YOU CAN FOCUS
ON WHAT YOU DO.

00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:28,261

AN AWFUL OFFER.

00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:29,429
HE'S REALLY SELLING.
WHAT I'M GONNA SAY IS --

00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:31,331
SO WHAT IS THE DEAL?
YEAH, WHAT'S THE DEAL?

00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:33,266
THE DEAL IS THE SAME
AS WHAT BARBARA OFFERED.

00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:35,401
$150,000 FOR 20%,
AND YOU GET TWO SHARKS,

00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,370
BUT YOU GOT TO DECIDE
RIGHT NOW.

00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:41,107

MADE AN OFFER, ANDREW.

TO WORK ON EQUITY?

ARE THE RETAIL STORES,

THERE'S NOTHING WITH THAT.

THAT WE WANT TO GO AFTER MASS.

WE THINK THAT IT HAS
VARIOUS LICENSING OPPORTUNITIES

00:14:14,619 --> 00:14:17,789

00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:53,792
AND SO WE WANTED TO SEE
IF WE CAN GET INTO STORES

00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,827
WITH NO MONEY
PUT TOWARDS MARKETING.

00:14:55,827 --> 00:14:59,564
$17,000 IN SALES IN THIS MARKET,
IT'S DEPRESSING.

00:14:59,564 --> 00:15:00,565
WHAT DOES IT SELL FOR?

00:15:00,565 --> 00:15:01,767
THIS IS $4.50 WHOLESALE

00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:03,735
AND $9.50 RETAIL
RIGHT NOW.

00:15:03,735 --> 00:15:06,538
WHAT IS THE PRICE
OF AN AVERAGE LIP BALM?

00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:08,540
A REGULAR SIZE --
EVEN THOUGH --

00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,674
EVEN THOUGH
IT'S SMALLER THAN THIS,

00:15:09,674 --> 00:15:11,343
A REGULAR SIZE,
WHAT DOES IT COST?

00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:15,347
THE AVERAGE COST OF
A VERY SMALL LIP BALM IS $2.59.

00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:17,582
SO FOR $2.59,
THEY COULD TECHNICALLY

00:15:17,582 --> 00:15:21,620
BUY THREE
FOR LESS MONEY THAN YOUR ONE.

00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,655
Moskow: RIGHT. BUT IT'S NOT
A CONVERSATION PIECE.
UH-OH.

00:15:23,655 --> 00:15:25,824
IT'S NOT SOMETHING
THEY WANT TO SHARE.
Cuban:
YEAH, BUT PEOPLE DON'T GIVE

00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:28,360
THAT MUCH THOUGHT
TO THEIR LIP-BALM PURCHASING.

00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,662
GUYS, LOOK,
HERE-- HERE'S WHAT I SEE.

00:15:30,662 --> 00:15:33,765
YOU GUYS HAVE GOT A PRODUCT,
NOT A COMPANY YET,

00:15:33,765 --> 00:15:36,768
AND YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO TURN IT INTO A COMPANY.

00:15:36,768 --> 00:15:38,370
AND THAT'S ALWAYS HARD.

00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,339
BUT WHAT YOU DO HAVE ALSO
IS A NICHE.

00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:44,342
SELLING THESE
IN ADULT-ENTERTAINMENT LOCATIONS

00:15:44,342 --> 00:15:45,677
IS GREAT.

00:15:45,677 --> 00:15:48,346
RUN WITH THAT.
MAKE SOME MONEY OFF OF IT.

00:15:48,346 --> 00:15:49,514
WIN THE BATTLE YOU'RE IN

00:15:49,514 --> 00:15:51,817
BEFORE TRYING TO TURN THIS
INTO A REAL COMPANY.

00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:53,652
WE'VE SPOKEN
TO INDUSTRY EXPERTS

00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,554
ABOUT THE NAME
BALM CHICKY BALM BALM,

00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:58,657
AND THEY HAVE SAID
BALM CHICKY BALM BALM IS GOLD.

00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:01,693
I-IT'S NOT GOLD,IT'S CUTE,
AND THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE.

00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:05,831
YOU HAVE A FANTASTIC,
CATCHY NAME.

00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:08,466
BUT REALLY
WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT

00:16:08,466 --> 00:16:10,468
IS HAVING THE GREAT PRODUCT.

00:16:10,468 --> 00:16:13,505
BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN
THINK OF A GREAT NAME.

00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:14,706
DID YOU TRY THE PRODUCT?
I DID TRY IT.

00:16:14,706 --> 00:16:16,741
I TRIED THE FRIEND END,
WHERE I HAD TO GO IN,

00:16:16,741 --> 00:16:19,377
WITH MY FINGER,
AND I DIDN'T LIKE THAT.

00:16:20,378 --> 00:16:21,713
I'M OUT.

00:16:21,713 --> 00:16:23,715
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

00:16:23,715 --> 00:16:24,783
Herjavec:
LADIES, I --

00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:27,352
A COUPLE
OF CHALLENGES.

00:16:27,352 --> 00:16:31,790
MOST BUYERS ARE YOUNGER-SKEWED,
LIKE KIDS, TEENAGERS, AND SO ON.

00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,426
I'M NOT SURE
I WANT MY KIDS

00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:36,828
BUYING SOMETHING
WITH AN ADULT THEME

00:16:36,828 --> 00:16:39,431
IN A GENERAL MARKET.

00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:41,366
FOR A NICHE MARKET,
THAT'S FANTASTIC

00:16:41,366 --> 00:16:43,368
IF YOU'RE GONNA SELL IT
IN ADULT STORES.

00:16:43,368 --> 00:16:45,337
BUT WE CAN ALSO PUT,
VERY EASILY, A LABEL ON HERE

00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,771
THAT IT IS INTENDED
FOR THOSE PEOPLE,

00:16:46,771 --> 00:16:49,674
AND IT HAS THE FRIEND END,
WHICH IS GREAT FOR TEENAGERS.
BUT YOU KNOW, ABBY,

00:16:49,674 --> 00:16:51,543
THAT'S REALLY MY CHALLENGE.

00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:53,478
EVERY TIME WE GAVE YOU
AN OBJECTION, YOU SAID,
"WE CAN DO THAT, TOO."

00:16:53,478 --> 00:16:55,380
WE'RE FLEXIBLE.
WE'RE FLEXIBLE.
"WE CAN DO THAT, TOO."

00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,348
WE CAN.
WE CAN DO IT ALL.

00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,582
IT'S GREAT TO PIVOT,

00:16:57,582 --> 00:17:00,585
BUT YOU CAN'T PIVOT
EVERY SINGLE MINUTE.

00:17:00,585 --> 00:17:04,856
AND $17,000
IS NOT A PROOF OF CONCEPT.

00:17:04,856 --> 00:17:07,492
I DON'T SEE THE COMPANY.

00:17:07,492 --> 00:17:11,596
I JUST SEE
A FUN, HIP, COOL NAME.

00:17:11,596 --> 00:17:13,632
I HAVE TO SAY IT
ONE MORE TIME BEFORE I'M OUT --

00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:14,633
BALM CHICKY BALM BALM.

00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:15,667
I'M OUT.
FAIR ENOUGH.

00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:18,403
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

00:17:18,403 --> 00:17:22,407
YOU KNOW, I-IF I HAD TO DREAM UP
A BUSINESS PLAN,

00:17:22,407 --> 00:17:24,609
GETTING MARKET SHARE
IN THE LIP-BALM SPACE

00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:27,345
PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE
ON THE TOP OF MY LIST.

00:17:27,345 --> 00:17:29,381
YOU'RE
SINGLE-CELL-AMOEBA PLAYERS.

00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,482
YOU'RE NOT EVEN COCKROACHES.

00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:31,816
Herjavec: KEVIN, I'M NOT CLEAR
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

00:17:31,816 --> 00:17:33,485
ARE YOU IN,
OR ARE YOU OUT?
I'M SAYING

00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:34,819
IT'S A BAD WASTE OF TIME...
I THINK I HAVE A GUESS.

00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:36,488
...BOTH YOURS AND MINE.

00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,657
AND I'M GONNA BURN IT MYSELF
IF YOU DON'T.

00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:39,624
I'M OUT.

00:17:39,624 --> 00:17:40,725
OKAY.

00:17:40,725 --> 00:17:42,427
THANKS.

00:17:42,427 --> 00:17:44,462
I THINK
YOU HAVE A CUTE NAME,

00:17:44,462 --> 00:17:48,533
BUT I LOVE A PRODUCT
THAT SOLVES A SIMPLE PROBLEM,

00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:50,635
AND I DON'T REALLY THINK
THERE'S A PROBLEM OUT THERE

00:17:50,635 --> 00:17:52,404
THAT YOU HAVE TO SOLVE
WITH THIS.

00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,673
BUT I'LL TELL YOU,
I HAVE VERY FEW BUSINESSES

00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,641
THAT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE
REINVENTED THREE TIMES OVER

00:17:56,641 --> 00:17:58,510
BEFORE THEY BECAME
GOOD SELLERS.

00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:01,479
DO NOT ENCOURAGE THEM, BARBARA.
I FORBID IT.
NO, I'M GONNA ENCOURAGE YOU.

00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:02,781
YOU'RE REINVENTING IT
AS YOU GO,

00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:05,350
SEEING WHAT'S WRONG,

00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,718
MAKING A LITTLE MOVEMENT
TO THE LEFT OR THE RIGHT.

00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:07,652
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

00:18:07,652 --> 00:18:08,753
RIGHT INTO A TRAIN.

00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:10,588
I'M SURE YOU'LL FIND
A WAY TO DO IT,

00:18:10,588 --> 00:18:12,390
BUT I HAVE TO RELUCTANTLY SAY
I'M OUT.

00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,592
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, BARBARA.

00:18:14,592 --> 00:18:16,561
I'M NOT SURE WHY THEY CALL YOU
MR. WONDERFUL.

00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:17,762
NOW YOU KNOW.
I TELL THE TRUTH.

00:18:17,762 --> 00:18:22,334
YOU'VE GOT
A PROFITABLE NICHE

00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:25,737
THAT YOU SHOULD BE EXPLOITING --
ADULT ENTERTAINMENT.

00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:28,373

THAT YOU HAVE SUCCESS AT...
I AGREE.

00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:29,641
AND YOU WILL MAKE
HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS.

00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,376
NOT EVERY BUSINESS
IS GOING TO BE

00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:33,678
A MILLION-DOLLAR
OR $5 MILLION --

00:18:33,678 --> 00:18:36,348
IF YOU GUYS ARE SELLING
$200,000 WORTH OF LIP BALM

00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:37,682
AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS DROP-SHIP

00:18:37,682 --> 00:18:39,718
FROM YOUR MANUFACTURER,
AND YOU'RE PUTTING $100,000

00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:41,686
IN YOUR POCKET
WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING...

00:18:41,686 --> 00:18:43,755
BUT WHEN YOU TRY TO DO
ALL OF THIS,

00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:46,658
YOU ARE GOING TO GROW YOURSELF
OUT OF BUSINESS.

00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:49,761
AND FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.

00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:53,398
WIN THE BATTLES
YOU'RE IN FIRST.

00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:55,333

GOING TO LOSE WITH CERTAINTY

00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,501
AND DON'T BOTHER
FIGHTING IT.

00:18:56,501 --> 00:18:58,670
CAN WE HAVE THAT NOT BE
THE LAST WORD AS WE WALK OUT?

00:18:58,670 --> 00:18:59,704
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

TO MAKE SURE YOUR MONEY
DOESN'T GO DOWN THE DRAIN.

00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:01,693
ALL RIGHT, I THINK
PROBABLY THE BEST THING TO DO

00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:03,361
IS GIVE YOU SOME SAMPLES.

00:21:03,361 --> 00:21:04,562
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:21:04,562 --> 00:21:06,598

YEAH, THOSE ARE 3-D --

00:21:14,372 --> 00:21:15,773
THOSE ARE 3-D PROTOTYPES,
SO THEY'RE FRAGILE.

JUST TURN TO THE LEFT, LIFT.

00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:23,715

YOU SQUEEZE, AND IT --

DOESN'T THIS START
TO CLOG UP THIS

00:21:26,784 --> 00:21:30,688
SO THAT YOU WOULD CONSTANTLY
BE HAVING TO CLEAN THIS OUT?

00:21:30,688 --> 00:21:32,724

00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:34,492

O'Leary: SO, IN THE HISTORY
OF "SHARK TANK,"

00:21:40,398 --> 00:21:42,767
THIS PRODUCT,
ABOVE ANY OTHER,

00:21:42,767 --> 00:21:45,737
LENDS ITSELF TO A LICENSING DEAL
WITH MANUFACTURERS.

00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:49,440
THE IDEA OF TAKING THIS
AS A PRODUCT ON ITS OWN

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,344
INTO RETAIL OR INTO DISTRIBUTION
IS A REALLY STUPID IDEA.

00:21:53,344 --> 00:21:56,514
THE ONLY WAY THIS BECOMES
A MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR SUCCESS

00:21:56,514 --> 00:21:59,651
IS IF YOU CAN CONVINCE
A MANUFACTURER OF PLUMBING

00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,785
THAT THIS IS
A BETTER MOUSE TRAP.

00:22:00,785 --> 00:22:02,787
ARE YOU
PREPARED TO DO THAT?

00:22:02,787 --> 00:22:05,623
ABSOLUTELY. THAT IS DEFINITELY
ONE OF THE LAUNCH STRATEGIES.

00:22:05,623 --> 00:22:07,525
WHY AREN'T YOU AT KOHLER

00:22:07,525 --> 00:22:11,362
AND THIS IS SIMPLY PART
OF THEIR NEW FAUCET LINE?

00:22:11,362 --> 00:22:12,697

00:22:12,697 --> 00:22:15,700
IN FACT, I JUST GOT THE FINAL

00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,735
FOUR WEEKS AGO
IN MY HAND, YEAH.

00:22:17,735 --> 00:22:19,470
SO THIS HASN'T EVEN BEEN
MANUFACTURED YET.

00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:21,639
THESE ARE ALL PROTOTYPES.
THOSE ARE ALL 3-D PROTOTYPES,

00:22:21,639 --> 00:22:23,641
BUT I'VE GOT SOURCING COSTS.
YEAH.

00:22:23,641 --> 00:22:25,677
WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND?

00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,413
SO, FOR THE LAST 11 YEARS,
I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN A REALTOR.

00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:31,649
MY BUSINESS WAS THRIVING,
AND THEN 2008 HIT, RIGHT?

00:22:31,649 --> 00:22:34,819
AND THEN THE BOTTOM FELL OUT.
WE LITERALLY LOST EVERYTHING.

00:22:34,819 --> 00:22:37,689
WE, UH, HAD OUR HOME
FORECLOSED ON.
WOW.

00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,424
WOW.
AND I HAD TWO CHOICES
AT THAT POINT --

00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:42,360
I COULD EITHER LAY ON THE MAT
OR FIGHT.

00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,496
AND I WASN'T GONNA LET
MY CHILDREN SEE ME ON THE MAT.

00:22:45,496 --> 00:22:48,366
AND I WAS NOT GONNA
LET THAT BE MY LEGACY.

00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:50,768
SO I REFOCUSED,
GOT BACK ON MY FEET,

00:22:50,768 --> 00:22:52,570
BACK IN REAL ESTATE,

00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,505
AND LAST YEAR,
I'M PROUD TO SAY,

00:22:54,505 --> 00:22:56,574
I WAS THE NUMBER 10
FULL-SERVICE REALTOR

00:22:56,574 --> 00:22:58,610
IN THE ENTIRE STATE
OF WASHINGTON.

00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:01,613
THAT'S NOT EASY TO DO.
GOOD FOR YOU.
WHAT DO YOU NEED FROM US?

00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:04,482
OBVIOUSLY,
I NEED YOUR EXPERIENCE.

00:23:04,482 --> 00:23:06,584
I'M GOING TO GUESS
THAT WHEN YOU CALL THE C.E.O.

00:23:06,584 --> 00:23:08,419
OF YOUR FAVORITE
PLUMBING COMPANY,

00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:09,621
HE DOESN'T RETURN
YOUR CALL.

00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:10,688
I DON'T HAVE THAT PROBLEM.

00:23:10,688 --> 00:23:12,457
EXACTLY.

00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:13,791
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
YOUR $110,000 FOR 20%.

00:23:15,526 --> 00:23:19,597
BUT IT'S CONTINGENT
ON SIGNING A LICENSING DEAL

00:23:19,597 --> 00:23:21,833
WITH A MANUFACTURER
OF YOUR CHOICE,

00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,601
UNDER TERMS
OF YOUR CHOICE.

00:23:23,601 --> 00:23:24,802
I'M GONNA NEGOTIATE THEM.

00:23:24,802 --> 00:23:27,338
I SEE THE PATH TO MAKING
A LOT OF MONEY WITH THIS,

00:23:27,338 --> 00:23:28,640
AND THERE'S ONLY ONE PATH.

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,441
YEAH.
YOU KNOW,
YOU MAY FIND ANOTHER SHARK.

00:23:30,441 --> 00:23:34,379
LORI MAY WANT TO SIT ON QVC
WITH A SINK AND SOME GLOVES ON

00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:36,481
AND WHATEVER ELSE,
BUT I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:38,750
DO YOU HAVE A PATENT
ON IT?

00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:42,820
BAM!
NOBODY ELSE CAN DO THIS.
NOBODY ELSE CAN DO THIS.

00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,389
SO YOU'RE THE REAL DEAL.

00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:45,723
THE QUESTION IS,
DO YOU WANT TO TAKE MY OFFER,

00:23:45,723 --> 00:23:46,724
OR DO YOU WANT TO WAIT
ALL DAY

00:23:46,724 --> 00:23:48,426
FOR THE REST
OF THESE SHARKETTES?

00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:51,596
WELL, I'D LIKE TO GIVE THE OTHER
SHARKS AN OPPORTUNITY TO --

00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:52,830
WELL, I'LL --
I'LL SIMPLIFY THINGS, GUYS.

00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,365
IT'S A PROOF OF CONCEPT,

00:23:54,365 --> 00:23:55,633
RIGHT, THAT YOU REALLY
HAVEN'T PROVEN YET.

00:23:55,633 --> 00:23:57,468
IT'S A PRODUCT.
IT'S NOT A COMPANY.

00:23:57,468 --> 00:23:59,370
IT'S NOT YOUR PRIMARY FOCUS.
MARK...

00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:01,673
DON'T GO OUT.

00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:03,574
THERE'S OTHER -- I MEAN,
THERE'S A BATHTUB VERSION

00:24:03,574 --> 00:24:05,443
THAT WE'RE WORKING ON.
IT'S NOT JUST A PRODUCT.

00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:08,613
THE MOST DIFFICULT
ENTREPRENEURS TO WORK WITH

00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,647
ARE INVENTORS

00:24:09,647 --> 00:24:11,482
BECAUSE THEY'RE FOCUSED
ON INVENTING,

00:24:11,482 --> 00:24:12,750
AS OPPOSED TO RUNNING
COMPANIES.

00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,585
THAT'S WHY I'M NOT PURSUING
ANYTHING ELSE

00:24:14,585 --> 00:24:16,387
UNTIL I GET THIS THING --
YOU'VE GOT A --

00:24:16,387 --> 00:24:18,790
Y-YOU'RE THE NUMBER 10 REALTOR
IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON.
MM-HMM.

00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,525
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH WORKING HARD?

00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:24,395
LOOK, I'M OUT.

00:24:24,395 --> 00:24:26,564
OKAY.
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

00:24:26,564 --> 00:24:28,599
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:29,734
IF THIS GOT TO THAT POINT

00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:31,769
WHERE IT REQUIRED
YOUR FULL-TIME USE,

00:24:31,769 --> 00:24:34,739
I'M JUST MAKING THE ASSUMPTION
YOU WOULD DO IT FULL TIME.

00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:37,442
YEAH.
THIS IS 100% MY PASSION.

00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:38,576
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE
THAT PATH.

00:24:38,576 --> 00:24:41,312
RIGHT.
IF YOU DECIDE --
BECAUSE YOU CONTROL IT --

00:24:41,312 --> 00:24:42,580
THAT YOU TAKE
THE LICENSE DEAL,

00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,816
ALL OF THAT IS TAKEN AWAY
FROM YOU, AND YOU CAN GO BACK

00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,551
TO REINVENTING
THE NEXT GREAT THING.

00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:47,618
THAT'S THE OTHER PART
I REALLY LIKE.

00:24:47,618 --> 00:24:49,554
I THINK,
UNDER A DEAL LIKE KEVIN,

00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:51,356
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:52,523
YOU KNOW, UH,

00:24:52,523 --> 00:24:54,759
WE HAD JEFF FOXWORTHY
ON THE SHOW MANY SEASONS AGO.

00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,794
HE CALLED IT, UH,
MAILBOX MONEY.

00:24:56,794 --> 00:24:58,663
RIGHT.
YOU GET THE CHECK EVERY MONTH.

00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,665
YEAH, YOU JUST GO
TO THE MAILBOX,

00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:01,833
AND YOU GET A CHECK
FROM THE ROYALTY.

00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,668
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO ANYTHING.
YEAH.

00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,636
ARE YOU SOLD
ON THAT BEING THE RIGHT PATH?

00:25:05,636 --> 00:25:07,505
I DON'T WANT TO GO ON
AN ALL-OR-NOTHING DEAL.

00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:09,741
HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE YOU
TO HAVE THIS PRODUCT?

00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:11,509
TO HAVE THE PRODUCT?
90 DAYS.

00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:12,777
DO YOU HAVE THE CASH
TO FUND THAT --

00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:14,479
THE TOOLING
AND THE MANUFACTURING?

00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:15,780
THAT'S PART OF WHAT
THE MONEY IS FOR.

00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,515
SO THAT'S WHAT YOU'D USE
THE MONEY FOR.

00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:18,850
I DON'T WANT TO GO
PRODUCE SOMETHING

00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,518
UNTIL WE'VE GOT DEALS,
RIGHT?

00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:21,552
OKAY.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:25:21,552 --> 00:25:23,488
I THINK KEVIN'S DEAL
IS THE RIGHT DEAL FOR YOU.

00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:24,722
THAT'S THE WAY TO GO.

00:25:24,722 --> 00:25:26,457
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA BE NUTS
SELLING THIS

00:25:26,457 --> 00:25:28,559
AS AN INDIVIDUAL PRODUCT.

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,361
I'M OUT.

00:25:30,361 --> 00:25:32,530
SORRY TO HEAR THAT,
BUT THANK YOU.

00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:35,433
I THINK IT'S CLEVER.

00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:40,371
BUT IT JUST SEEMS
VERY COMPLICATED TO ME.

00:25:40,371 --> 00:25:41,806
I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE TESTING
FRIENDS AND FAMILY.

00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:45,343
I MEAN, THAT'S THE FIRST THINGS,
NATURALLY, WHAT YOU WOULD DO.

00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:47,345
BUT I'M NOT SURE
THAT THIS IS GONNA WORK.

00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:51,315
AND I DON'T THINK WE HAVE
THE PROOF HERE OF THAT.

00:25:51,315 --> 00:25:55,420
I THINK IT'S TRICKY,
SO FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.

00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,755
OKAY.
WELL, THANK YOU.

00:25:57,755 --> 00:25:59,490
Herjavec:
I LIKE THE PRODUCT.

00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:02,360
I THINK THE LARGE
FAUCET MANUFACTURERS

00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,395
ARE EITHER GONNA ADOPT IT
OR THEY'RE NOT.

00:26:04,395 --> 00:26:05,630
AND IF THEY DO ADOPT IT,

00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,732
YOU CAN DO MULTIPLE
LICENSING DEALS.

00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,534
KEVIN IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:11,803
EVERYBODY RETURNS
HIS PHONE CALL.

00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:14,739
THE PROBLEM IS, NOBODY EVER
TALKS TO KEVIN A SECOND TIME.

00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,340
YEAH.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,442
SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S GOOD

00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:19,644
TO BE RUTHLESS
AND -- AND NASTY

00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:21,546
AND MEAN IN BUSINESS.
YES, IT IS. YES, IT IS.

00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:22,780
BUT, YOU KNOW,
OVER THE LONG TERM,

00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,716
I'VE FOUND THAT IT'S ALSO
VERY GOOD TO BE NICE.

00:26:25,716 --> 00:26:28,853
AND IT'S GOOD TO DO DEALS
WHERE BOTH SIDES MAKE MONEY.

00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:32,590
I LIKE THE STRUCTURE --
$110,000.

00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:35,693
BUT TO TAKE 20% FROM YOU
FOR, REALLY, MAKING A PHONE CALL

00:26:35,693 --> 00:26:37,395
JUST DOESN'T SEEM
FAIR TO ME.

00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:42,400
ALL RIGHT.
SO...

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,634
HERE'S MY OFFER.

00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:55,480
Narrator:
THREE SHARKS ARE OUT.

00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,584
KEVIN HAS MADE AN OFFER
OF $110,000 FOR A 20% STAKE,

00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:02,753
CONTINGENT ON SECURING
A LICENSING DEAL

00:27:02,753 --> 00:27:06,390
FOR NAUSHAD'S
DRAIN-CLOG SOLUTION,

00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,558
DRAIN STRAIN.

00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:09,460
BUT ROBERT IS ALSO INTERESTED.

00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:12,497
Herjavec: TO TAKE 20% FROM YOU
FOR, REALLY, MAKING A PHONE CALL

00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:13,631
JUST DOESN'T SEEM
FAIR TO ME.

00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:18,402
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $110,000.

00:27:18,402 --> 00:27:20,738
I THINK YOUR ASK FOR 15%
WAS TOO HIGH.

00:27:20,738 --> 00:27:22,373
I'M WILLING TO TAKE 10%.

00:27:23,374 --> 00:27:27,578
SO I'LL GIVE YOU $110,000,
SAME CONTINGENCY AS KEVIN,

00:27:27,578 --> 00:27:29,514
BUT I WANT 10%.

00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:33,718
BEFORE YOU MAKE YOUR DECISION,
I WANT TO TELL YOU A STORY.

00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:36,654
ALL SHARKS WILL LEARN,
ALL RIGHT?

00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:38,389
WE'RE GOING BACK
TO THE ANCIENT TIMES.

00:27:38,389 --> 00:27:42,527
APOLLO, A VERY POWERFUL GOD,
WAS DATING A NYMPH.

00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:44,395
LOVED HER,
ALL RIGHT?

00:27:44,395 --> 00:27:45,429
BUT SO WAS THE FISHERMAN

00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:46,831
POMPILUS
INTERESTED IN THE NYMPH.

00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,366
[ LAUGHS ]

00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:51,502
AND HE CONVINCED HER
TO RUN AWAY FROM APOLLO.

00:27:51,502 --> 00:27:53,504
BIG MISTAKE.
HERE'S WHY.

00:27:53,504 --> 00:27:57,642
WHAT HAPPENS IS APOLLO DAMNED
THE FISHERMAN TO ETERNITY

00:27:57,642 --> 00:28:00,711
TO COME BACK FOREVER
AS A PILOT FISH,

00:28:00,711 --> 00:28:02,813
DEPENDENT
ON A GREAT WHITE SHARK.

00:28:02,813 --> 00:28:04,782
PILOT FISH ONLY EXISTS
OFF THE SCRAPS...

00:28:04,782 --> 00:28:06,617
YOU NEED A CHART
FOR THIS ONE.

00:28:06,617 --> 00:28:08,819
...THAT ARE INSIDE THE MOUTH
OF THE SHARK

00:28:08,819 --> 00:28:10,521
IN A FEEDING FRENZY.
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

00:28:10,521 --> 00:28:11,722
THE POINT I'M MAKING IS...

00:28:11,722 --> 00:28:13,524
THERE IS A POINT?
...I'M WORTH 10% MORE

00:28:13,524 --> 00:28:14,659
BECAUSE I JUST AM.

00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:16,827
IF YOU WANT
THE DISCOUNT PILOT FISH,

00:28:16,827 --> 00:28:19,797
TAKE THE DEAL, ALL RIGHT?
BUT YOU TO DECIDE, THOUGH.
YOU GOT TO DECIDE.

00:28:19,797 --> 00:28:21,465
AND KNOW WITH CERTAINTY

00:28:21,465 --> 00:28:24,468
THAT HE'LL ALWAYS BE DEPENDENT
ON THE BIG SHARK.

00:28:24,468 --> 00:28:25,770
YOU HAVE TWO OFFERS
ON THE TABLE.

00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,405
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:34,779
KEVIN,
I APPRECIATE YOUR OFFER.

00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:36,681
BUT I THINK THE SHARKS,

00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:39,717
EVEN THE PILOT FISH
THAT YOU CALL -- [ LAUGHS ]

00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:43,854
I'M NOT A PILOT FISH,
GOSH DARN IT!

00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:48,359
ACTUALLY, CAN I -- CAN I
JUST TALK TO MY WIFE REAL QUICK?

00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:50,428
WHAT?!
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO TALK
TO YOUR WIFE? WHY WOULD YOU --

00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:51,562
NO.
NO WAY, NAUSHAD.

00:28:51,562 --> 00:28:52,597
NO. NO.
YOU CAN MAKE THAT DECISION.

00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:53,631
THIS IS YOUR MOMENT.

00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:55,533
DON'T BLOW IT BY STALLING,
PLEASE.

00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:56,801
ALL RIGHT.

00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:00,438
ROBERT,
I'D LOVE TO DO A DEAL WITH YOU.

00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:02,573
DONE.
HE TOOK THE PILOT FISH.

00:29:02,573 --> 00:29:03,708
TAKE THAT, BIG SHOT.

00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:05,543
WELL, YOU KNOW --
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS, ROBERT?

00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:09,513
I THINK, UH, YOU HAVE A GREAT
PHILOSOPHY, MY WIFE LOVES YOU,

00:29:09,513 --> 00:29:12,750
AND I THINK YOU'D BE
A GOOD PERSON TO WORK WITH.
I AM A GOOD PERSON TO WORK WITH.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,518
TAKE CARE, YOU GUYS.
THANK YOU.

00:29:14,518 --> 00:29:15,519
CONGRATULATIONS.

00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:17,722
Herjavec: KEVIN.

00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:19,357
YES, LITTLE PILOT?

00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:21,826
LET'S GO BACK TO THAT STORY.
HOW DOES THE STORY END NOW?

00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:23,628
AH, LIVE AND LEARN.

00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:24,695
FOR MY FAMILY,

00:29:24,695 --> 00:29:27,732
THIS IS A WONDERFUL,
WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE

00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:31,636
BECAUSE FOR MY CHILDREN
TO SEE THAT WE CAN BOUNCE BACK

00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:34,572
OFF THE MAT
AND MAKE OUR DREAMS COME TRUE

00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:37,475
IS THE LEGACY I WANT TO LEAVE
FOR THEM.

00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:44,782
Narrator: IN SEASON FOUR,
COREY WARD AND TREW QUACKENBUSH

00:29:44,782 --> 00:29:46,384
MADE A DEAL
WITH BARBARA CORCORAN

00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:49,420
FOR THEIR GRILLED-CHEESE
FRANCHISE, TOM+CHEE.

00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,389
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
I'D SAY WE TAKE THE DEAL.

00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:52,823
Narrator:
LET'S SEE HOW THEY'RE DOING NOW.

00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:57,662
I, JOHN CRANLEY,

00:29:57,662 --> 00:30:01,699

00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:02,767
[ CHEERS ]

00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:04,802
Ward: BECAUSE OF OUR
ECONOMIC IMPACT ON THE CITY,

00:30:04,802 --> 00:30:06,637
THE MAYOR HAS DECLARED IT
TOM+CHEE DAY.

00:30:06,637 --> 00:30:08,472
IN THE YEAR LEADING UP
TO "SHARK TANK,"

00:30:08,472 --> 00:30:10,541
WE'D DONE A MILLION DOLLARS
IN SALES.

00:30:10,541 --> 00:30:11,575
IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS NOW,

00:30:11,575 --> 00:30:12,810
AND WE'VE GROSSED
OVER $14 MILLION.

00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,712
LET'S GIVE THAT ONE
A TASTE FIRST.

00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:17,415
Corcoran: COREY AND TREW
ARE GREAT RESTAURATEURS,

00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:18,382
GREAT MARKETERS,

00:30:18,382 --> 00:30:19,750
AND THEY'VE WORKED
THEIR BUTTS OFF.

00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,686
FIVE YEARS AGO,
THEY'RE IN A TENT HERE

00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:22,753
SELLING GRILLED CHEESE,

00:30:22,753 --> 00:30:24,855
AND TODAY
THEY HAVE A CHEESE EMPIRE.

00:30:24,855 --> 00:30:26,490
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,359
HEY, EVERYBODY!

00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:31,462
THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE
FOR TOM+CHEE SO FAR

00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:32,630
HAS BEEN RETAIL SPACE.

00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,732
WE'RE COMPETING
AGAINST THE BIG BOYS.

00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:36,767
WITH BARBARA'S KNOWLEDGE
AND EXPERIENCE IN REAL ESTATE,

00:30:36,767 --> 00:30:38,502
SHE'S REALLY HELPED
LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD.

00:30:38,502 --> 00:30:39,537
BEFORE "SHARK TANK,"

00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:41,672
WE HAD 3 LOCATIONS
AND 70 EMPLOYEES.

00:30:41,672 --> 00:30:43,374
WE NOW HAVE 19 LOCATIONS

00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:45,543
AND OVER 500 EMPLOYEES
WORKING FOR US.

00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:47,645
WE'VE RECEIVED
OVER 25,000 FRANCHISE REQUESTS.

00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:50,481

TOM+CHEE IN ALL 50 STATES

00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:52,683

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES --
PRETTY MUCH EVERYWHERE.

00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:55,853
JOB WELL DONE.

00:30:55,853 --> 00:30:59,457
AS A SHARK, THIS IS WHAT
I DREAM ABOUT GETTING.

00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:00,791
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN
EVERY DAY.

00:31:00,791 --> 00:31:03,494
THIS IS JUST AN AMAZING
AMERICAN SUCCESS STORY.

00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:06,363
WE STARTED WITH AN IDEA
AND $2,400.

00:31:06,363 --> 00:31:08,799
WE'RE GROWING THIS
INTO A MULTINATIONAL BRAND.

00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,468
WE'RE GONNA TAKE
OUR GRILLED CHEESE

00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:12,336
AND ALL THOSE SMILES
AROUND THE WORLD.

00:31:12,336 --> 00:31:14,505
CHEESE!
CHEESE!
CHEESE!
CHEESE!

00:31:21,445 --> 00:31:24,381
Narrator:
NEXT INTO THE TANK IS A PRODUCT

00:31:24,381 --> 00:31:27,752
TO ENSURE YOUR BED IS ALWAYS
AT THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE.

00:31:36,393 --> 00:31:38,462
HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS MARK ARAMLI.

00:31:38,462 --> 00:31:41,365
I'M FROM THE BEAUTIFUL CITY
OF NEWPORT, RHODE ISLAND.

00:31:41,365 --> 00:31:42,800
MY COMPANY IS BEDJET,

00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:47,438
AND I'M SEEKING $250,000
FOR 10% OF THE COMPANY.

00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:48,639
IN THE WINTERTIME,

00:31:48,639 --> 00:31:50,608
NEVER GET
INTO ANOTHER CHILLY BED

00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:53,310
WITH COLD FEET EVER AGAIN.

00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:58,382
THE BEDJET IS THE WORLD'S FIRST
ULTRA-RAPID AND AFFORDABLE

00:31:58,382 --> 00:32:02,486
COOLING, HEATING,
AND CLIMATE-CONTROL SYSTEM

00:32:02,486 --> 00:32:03,821
DESIGNED JUST FOR OUR BEDS
AT HOME.

00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:06,657
SIMPLY PLACE THE BASE UNIT
UNDER THE BED,

00:32:06,657 --> 00:32:08,692
PUT THE NOZZLE
INTO YOUR BEDDING.

00:32:08,692 --> 00:32:11,595
WE GIVE YOUR BEDDING
THAT LUXURIOUS, HOT-TOWEL,

00:32:11,595 --> 00:32:13,364
JUST-OUT-OF-THE-DRYER FEEL

00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:15,633
IN ONLY THREE MINUTES
FROM THE TOUCH OF A REMOTE.

00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:20,771
REMOTE CONTROLS INCLUDE
OUR INTELLIGENT SMARTPHONE APP.

00:32:20,771 --> 00:32:23,674
YOU CAN EVEN PROGRAM
A BEDJET ALARM

00:32:23,674 --> 00:32:26,510
TO WAKE YOU UP IN THE MORNING
WITH A COOL BLAST OF AIR.

00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,412
AH.
NOW, THE BEDJET
PAYS FOR ITSELF.

00:32:28,412 --> 00:32:32,416
WHY HEAT OR COOL THE WHOLE HOUSE
OR EVEN BEDROOM AT NIGHT

00:32:32,416 --> 00:32:34,485
WHEN ALL THAT MATTERS
FOR THOSE EIGHT HOURS

00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:36,420
IS THE TEMPERATURE
BETWEEN THE SHEETS.

00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,588
SHARKS, THAT'S THE BEDJET.

00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:40,457
IF ANY OF YOU STILL HAVE
COLD FEET ON JOINING THE TEAM

00:32:40,457 --> 00:32:41,725
AFTER WHAT YOU'VE HEARD,
THAT'S OKAY.

00:32:41,725 --> 00:32:44,595
WE'LL WARM THEM UP
RIGHT OVER HERE.

00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:45,796
CAN WE TRY IT?
YES.

00:32:45,796 --> 00:32:47,631
MARK, HOW MUCH NOISE
DOES IT MAKE?

00:32:47,631 --> 00:32:48,699
IT'S QUIETER
THAN ANY FAN.

00:32:48,699 --> 00:32:50,467
IT'S QUIETER
THAN ANY ROOM AIR CONDITIONER.

00:32:50,467 --> 00:32:52,636
OH! I'M GETTING IN BED
WITH MARK.
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.

00:32:52,636 --> 00:32:53,737
IT'S ABOUT
THE SAME LEVEL...

00:32:53,737 --> 00:32:55,606
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT?"

00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:57,641
...OF YOUR HOUSEHOLD
HVAC REGISTER.
MOVE OVER, BUDDY.

00:32:57,641 --> 00:32:59,577
WOW. IS THAT A WATER MATTRESS
YOU HAVE THERE?

00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:00,644
NO.

00:33:00,644 --> 00:33:02,546
UH, WE ARE JUST SENDING AIR
INTO THE BED

00:33:02,546 --> 00:33:03,747
SO IT GIVES US
A LITTLE PUFFING.

00:33:03,747 --> 00:33:05,583
WAIT.
THERE'S MORE.

00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:09,787
50% OF COUPLES HAVE DIFFERENT
SLEEP-TEMPERATURE PREFERENCES.

00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:11,622
HE LIKES IT HOT,
SHE LIKES IT COOL.

00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:14,425
THERE'S ALWAYS A FIGHT
OVER THE THERMOSTAT.

00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:17,595
THE BEDJET
HAS DUAL-ZONE CAPABILITY.

00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:18,729
WHAT'S IT LIKE, LORI?

00:33:18,729 --> 00:33:20,698
MY -- MY SIDE IS HOT.
I FEEL HOT AIR. RIGHT?

00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:21,732
YEAH, I MEAN, IT'S COOL.

00:33:21,732 --> 00:33:23,500
I MEAN,
IT FEELS GOOD ON MY FEET.

00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,702
BUT THE QUESTION IS,
HOW DO YOU HOOK IT UP?

00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:25,803
WE HAVE A NOZZLE HERE.

00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:27,605
IF WE'RE GONNA DO DUAL ZONE,
WE PLUG IT INTO THIS.

00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:29,406
SO, LIKE, THERE'S
A SPECIAL SHEET, RIGHT?

00:33:29,406 --> 00:33:31,675
SO YOU PUT A SPECIAL SHEET THERE
THAT HAS THE HOLE AT THE BOTTOM?

00:33:31,675 --> 00:33:33,344
ONLY FOR DUAL ZONE.

00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,645
IF IT'S SINGLE ZONE,
RIGHT, JUST ONE --

00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:36,513
SINGLE ZONE,
WE JUST HAVE THIS LITTLE GUY,

00:33:36,513 --> 00:33:38,382
AND YOU'VE GOT THE SHEET
THROWN OVER HIM,

00:33:38,382 --> 00:33:40,351
AND HE'S SENDING --
OKAY, SO THAT JUST POPS
ON THE EDGE OF THE BED,

00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,719
AND IT JUST BLOWS OUT
COLD OR HOT AIR.

00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:43,487
YOU GOT IT.
SO THAT KEEPS IT SIMPLE.

00:33:43,487 --> 00:33:44,588
BUT ALSO, TOO,

00:33:44,588 --> 00:33:48,359
IS THERE TWO DIFFERENT,
UM, ATTACHMENT HOSES?

00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,526
THERE'S TWO MACHINES,
SO YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER ONE

00:33:49,526 --> 00:33:51,595
INSTALLED
ON THE OTHER SIDE.

00:33:51,595 --> 00:33:53,664
Corcoran: YOU SET A TIMER
SO YOU COULD COOL IT DOWN

00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,699
FOR 10 MINUTES,
AND IT TURNS ITSELF OFF.
YEAH.

00:33:55,699 --> 00:33:58,469
SO, WE HAVE
AUTO-SHUTOFF TIMERS

00:33:58,469 --> 00:33:59,603
WHICH ARE VARIABLE,

00:33:59,603 --> 00:34:02,439
DEPENDING ON WHETHER
YOU'RE HEATING OR COOLING.

00:34:02,439 --> 00:34:03,674
PROVE TO ME
THE MARKET CARES.

00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:06,343
YEAH, LET'S TALK
ABOUT THE ECONOMICS.
GIVE US YOUR SALES.

00:34:06,343 --> 00:34:09,446
OKAY, WE ARE GOING
INTO PRODUCTION IN SIX WEEKS.

00:34:09,446 --> 00:34:10,814
OH, THERE ARE NO SALES.

00:34:12,549 --> 00:34:14,551
HOW'D YOU COME UP
WITH THIS?

00:34:14,551 --> 00:34:16,520
I USED TO BE AN ENGINEER
ON THE NASA SPACE-SUIT PROGRAM.

00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,721
OH, WOW.
AND I WAS RESPONSIBLE

00:34:17,721 --> 00:34:19,556
FOR SOME OF THE COOLING
AND HEATING

00:34:19,556 --> 00:34:21,525
AND CLIMATE-CONTROL SYSTEMS
OF THE SUIT.

00:34:21,525 --> 00:34:23,594
WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE ONE?

00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:24,728
UH, $98.

00:34:24,728 --> 00:34:26,597
UH, WE HAVE A, UH,

00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:28,732
MARKET TEST
THAT WE DID VIA KICKSTARTER.

00:34:28,732 --> 00:34:31,402
WE SOLD MORE THAN $50,000
WORTH OF PRODUCT.

00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,670
WHAT WAS THE, UM,
PRICE PER UNIT?

00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:35,673
UH, THE RETAIL PRICE FOR THIS
IS GONNA BE $499.

00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:37,541
O'Leary: OHH!
WOW!

00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:39,677
THAT'S MORE EXPENSIVE
THAN A MATTRESS.

00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:41,545
HOUSTON, WE GOT A PROBLEM.
LET ME TELL YOU

00:34:41,545 --> 00:34:43,781
WHAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED
SINCE WE STARTED SELLING,

00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:45,382
OKAY?
OKAY.

00:34:45,382 --> 00:34:47,618
WE HAD OUR FIRST TRADE SHOW
IN LAS VEGAS,

00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:49,753
WHICH IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST
TRADE SHOWS

00:34:49,753 --> 00:34:52,489
FOR THE SLEEP-PRODUCT
AND BEDDING INDUSTRY.

00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:55,526
DURING THE SHOW,
SOMETHING MAGIC HAPPENED.

00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:59,830
EVERY SINGLE MAJOR PLAYER
IN THE BEDDING INDUSTRY

00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:02,733
CAME TO US AND SAID,
"WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THIS.

00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:03,767
"WE WANT THIS.

00:35:03,767 --> 00:35:07,671
"WE HAVE BUYER SAMPLE REQUESTS
WITH INTENT

00:35:07,671 --> 00:35:09,340
TO PUT INTO THE MARKET
FROM MATTRESS FIRM."

00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,407
MARK, THERE'S A PROBLEM
WITH THAT.

00:35:10,407 --> 00:35:12,810
THESE ARE THE MATTRESS
MANUFACTURERS, OKAY?

00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,345
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW

00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:16,580
IS WHEN THE CONSUMER
WALKS UP TO THAT MACHINE

00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,782
AND THEY SEE IT'S $500,
THEY SAY,

00:35:18,782 --> 00:35:22,419
"WOW, I CAN GET A BRAND-NEW BED
FOR THAT PRICE."

00:35:22,419 --> 00:35:25,589
I THINK THE PRICE
IS NUTS.

00:35:25,589 --> 00:35:29,393
AT THE LAS VEGAS SHOW, OKAY,
WE HAVE NOW SIGNED UP RETAILERS

00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:31,362
WHO ARE GETTING SAMPLES...
WHO DO YOU HAVE?

00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:32,463
...AND WHO WANT TO PUT THIS

00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,464
INTO THE MARKET.
NAME THE NAME.

00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,665
SIT 'N SLEEP.

00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:36,800
YOU WILL NEVER SELL THIS DEVICE
FOR $499.

00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,402
IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN.

00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:40,371
WHY DON'T WE HEAR...
NEVER, NEVER, NEVER.

00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:41,805
...WHAT THOSE MATTRESS
MANUFACTURERS SAID?

00:35:41,805 --> 00:35:42,706
MR. WONDERFUL --

00:35:42,706 --> 00:35:43,774
NOT A CHANCE IN HELL.

00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:46,310
THE DEVIL HIMSELF
WON'T PAY YOU FOR THAT.

00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:51,348
DO YOU HAVE ANY ORDERS
AT THAT PRICE POINT?

00:35:51,348 --> 00:35:53,817
WE HAVE A P.O.
FOR $1.1 MILLION.

00:35:53,817 --> 00:35:55,519
REALLY?

00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,722
FROM WHO?

00:35:58,722 --> 00:36:00,591
THAT CAME IN, UH,
JUST LAST WEEK, OKAY?

00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:03,394
THIS IS THE LARGEST
MATTRESS MANUFACTURER

00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:05,562
AND OLDEST MANUFACTURER
IN AUSTRALIA.

00:36:05,562 --> 00:36:06,730
WHO?
A.H. BEARD.

00:36:07,831 --> 00:36:09,400
IT'S IMPRESSIVE.

00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,468
Cuban: SO, WHAT'S
THE SECRET SAUCE IN THE DEVICE?

00:36:11,468 --> 00:36:14,671
SO, WHAT SEPARATES US FROM
EVERYONE WHO'S COME BEFORE --

00:36:14,671 --> 00:36:18,442
WE ARE THE ONLY PRODUCT
THAT IS ULTRA-RAPID, OKAY?

00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:19,777
EVERY OTHER PRODUCT --

00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:22,312
OKAY, NO, NO, WAIT.
BEFORE YOU GO AND PITCH ME,

00:36:22,312 --> 00:36:24,415
RIGHT,
I ASKED A QUESTION.

00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:26,383
'CAUSE WHAT I WANT
IS A TECHNICAL ANSWER.

00:36:26,383 --> 00:36:27,785
I WANT
A TECHNICAL ANSWER

00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:30,421
ON WHY THAT'S BETTER
OR DIFFERENT

00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:31,422
OR WHATEVER YOU THINK

00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:32,756
YOUR SECRET SAUCE IS
IN THE DEVICE.

00:36:32,756 --> 00:36:35,359
OKAY, THERE'S NO PRODUCT
IN THE WORLD

00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,794
THAT WILL HEAT
A KING-SIZE BED

00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:40,497
TO FEEL LIKE THE SHEETS CAME OUT
OF THE DRYER IN THREE MINUTES.

00:36:40,497 --> 00:36:41,732
AND WHAT ALLOWS
THAT TO HAPPEN?

00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:43,700
AGAIN, I ASKED --
I DIDN'T ASK FOR THE PITCH.

00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:47,404
WE'RE THE ONLY PRODUCT
THAT USES DIRECT CONVECTION AIR

00:36:47,404 --> 00:36:49,406
INTO THE BED TO COOL YOU
AND HEAT YOU.

00:36:49,406 --> 00:36:50,574
AND NOW --

00:36:50,574 --> 00:36:53,577
SO YOU'RE LIKE A CONVECTION OVEN
THAT JUST TAKES THE OUTPUT

00:36:53,577 --> 00:36:55,612
AND JUST BLOWS IT IN
UNDERNEATH THE SHEETS.

00:36:55,612 --> 00:36:57,347
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
YOU CAN SEND

00:36:57,347 --> 00:36:59,817
1,500 WATTS OF POWER
INTO A BED SAFELY.

00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:02,820
MARK, YOU HAD MATTRESS
MANUFACTURERS.

00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,689
THAT, TO ME,
IS THE BIGGER KAHUNA.

00:37:05,689 --> 00:37:07,424
WHY?
NO, IT ISN'T.

00:37:07,424 --> 00:37:10,594
MARK, WHAT DID THEY SAY TO YOU
THEY WANTED TO DO?

00:37:10,594 --> 00:37:11,829
DID THEY SAY,
"WE WANT TO HAVE MEETINGS

00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:13,363
WITH YOU LATER"?

00:37:13,363 --> 00:37:15,466
WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THEM
TALKING TO YOU?

00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:17,534
SO, SLEEP TEMPERATURE
AND SLEEP SCIENCE

00:37:17,534 --> 00:37:20,471
IS MORE AND MORE IDENTIFYING,
UH, SLEEPING TEMPERATURE

00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:22,639
AS HAVING A DEEP IMPACT
ON RESTFUL SLEEP.

00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:24,708
O'Leary: LISTEN, LISTEN.
LOOK, THAT'S GREAT,

00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:26,810
BUT I CAN SEE
MR. AND MRS. SCHLEBINSKI

00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,745
WALKING IN TO BUY
A NEW MATTRESS,

00:37:28,745 --> 00:37:31,515
AND MRS. SCHLEBINSKI
SAYS TO MR. SCHLEBINSKI,

00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:33,517
"HONEY,
WHAT'S THAT BEDJET THERE?"

00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:36,520
AND HE SAYS, "WOW, IT SAYS
IT HEATS OR COOLS OUR BED."

00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,555
AND SHE SAYS,
"HONEY, LET'S GET IT."

00:37:38,555 --> 00:37:40,691
AND HE SAYS,
"HOW MUCH IS IT?"

00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:42,392
AND HE GOES, "$500!"

00:37:42,392 --> 00:37:44,795
THEY BOTH A HEART ATTACK
AND THEY LEAVE.

00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:46,396
DO THEY?

00:37:46,396 --> 00:37:47,498
THERE'S 3--

00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:49,733
I DON'T KNOW.
WHEN CAN I FIND OUT?

00:37:49,733 --> 00:37:51,702
THERE ARE 300 MILLION BEDROOMS
IN AMERICA.

00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:53,437
I GET ALL THAT.
NO, YOU DON'T.

00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,638
THE MARKET'S SO BIG.
MY COST OF GOODS SOLD...

00:37:54,638 --> 00:37:55,806
I WANT TO BACK
TO WHAT I ASKED YOU.

00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:58,609
MARK, MARK, IGNORE HIM.
...IS AT 1,000 UNITS PER LOT.

00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,410
MARK, IGNORE HIM.

00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:02,713
YOU ARE GOING TO FAIL.
YOU'VE OVERPRICED IT
BECAUSE YOU'RE A PIG.

00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:04,314
QUIET!
OHH. OY VEY.

00:38:04,314 --> 00:38:05,716
WE WERE
SUPPOSED TO BE TALKING

00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:07,684
ABOUT WHAT THE MATTRESS
MANUFACTURERS --
MARK,
I HAVE A SIMPLE QUESTION.

00:38:07,684 --> 00:38:11,355
MARK, IF YOU DON'T LISTEN TO ME,
I'M GOING OUT.
WHY DID YOU MAKE THIS PRODUCT?

00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:13,490
THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION.
I'M OUT.

00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,468
MARK, IF YOU DON'T LISTEN TO ME,
I'M GOING OUT.

00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,403
THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION.
I'M OUT.

00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,607
'CAUSE YOU DON'T BELIEVE
YOU CAN SELL ANY.

00:38:30,607 --> 00:38:32,476
NO, I ASKED HIM FIVE TIMES
TO ANSWER MY QUESTION,

00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,344
HE IGNORED ME,
AND NOW I'M OUT.

00:38:34,344 --> 00:38:35,779
I-I'M VERY, VERY SORRY, LORI.
SORRY.

00:38:35,779 --> 00:38:37,614
IT'S -- IT'S HARD TO KEEP UP
WITH ALL THE QUESTIONS.

00:38:37,614 --> 00:38:39,416
I GET IT,
BUT I WAS SHOUTING.

00:38:39,416 --> 00:38:41,451
COULD YOU PLEASE
ASK THE QUESTION AGAIN?

00:38:41,451 --> 00:38:42,586
I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER IT.

00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:43,720
NO.

00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:52,529
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT
THE PATH FORWARD IS FOR THIS.

00:38:52,529 --> 00:38:55,732
WE BELIEVE MARKET ENTRY FOR THIS
IS AN ASSISTED SALE.

00:38:55,732 --> 00:38:58,802
IT NEEDS TO BE SOLD
WHERE PEOPLE BUY MATTRESSES,

00:38:58,802 --> 00:39:02,539
SO THERE IS A PREMIUM MARKET
OUT THERE THAT IS MASSIVE.

00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:03,774
Cuban: MARK, I THINK
IT'S A COOL PRODUCT, RIGHT?

00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:05,509
WHAT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH
IS THAT,

00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,611
WHEN I ASKED
ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY,

00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:08,745
YOU KEPT ON SELLING.

00:39:08,745 --> 00:39:10,414
I JUST DON'T LIKE THE VIBE.

00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:12,516
I JUST DON'T THINK YOU HAVE ALL
THE PIECES YET TO GO FORWARD,

00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:13,817
AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.

00:39:13,817 --> 00:39:18,422
MARK,
YOU MENTIONED, CLEARLY,

00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:20,624
THAT THIS IS INTENDED TARGETED
TO THE PREMIUM-MATTRESS BUYER.

00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:22,659
BEYOND PREMIUM.
THAT 25% --

00:39:22,659 --> 00:39:25,395
BUT THAT'S YOUR SWEET SPOT,
RIGHT?

00:39:25,395 --> 00:39:26,630
HERE'S MY OBJECTION TO IT.

00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:30,334
MOST OF THE PREMIUM BUYERS TODAY
ARE NOT BUYING THIS STYLE BED.

00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:31,702
THE UPHOLSTERED BED
THAT ALMOST HITS THE FLOOR

00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,471
IS THE MOST COMMONLY
SOLD BED TODAY.

00:39:34,471 --> 00:39:36,406
MY BED WOULDN'T FIT THAT
UNDER THERE

00:39:36,406 --> 00:39:38,442
BECAUSE I HAVE
A LOVELY UPHOLSTERED BED.

00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:41,311
I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE SOMETHING
THAT'S GONNA SELL WELL HERE.

00:39:41,311 --> 00:39:42,679
I WISH I BELIEVED YOU,
BUT I DON'T. I'M OUT.

00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:46,516
OKAY. THANK YOU.

00:39:46,516 --> 00:39:47,718
I SEE CATASTROPHE.

00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:50,654
I SEE DISASTER.

00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:55,359
I SEE BLACK CLOUDS,
DEVASTATION, TOTAL COLLAPSE.

00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:56,827
HERE'S WHAT
IT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE.

00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:58,428
YOU'RE GONNA SHIP OUT

00:39:58,428 --> 00:40:00,497
A COUPLE OF MILLION DOLLARS
WORTH OF INVENTORY,

00:40:00,497 --> 00:40:03,667
TRY AND SELL IT AT $499
AT SPECIALTY-MATTRESS STORES.

00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:06,603
IT'S GONNA SIT THERE.
IT'S NOT GONNA TURN.

00:40:06,603 --> 00:40:08,805
THE NIGHT STAFF
ARE GONNA TRY AND USE IT

00:40:08,805 --> 00:40:10,474
TO ACTUALLY WASH
THE CARPETS.

00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:11,575
THEY DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS.

00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,410
[ LAUGHS ]

00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:16,380
THE PRODUCT IS DEAD ALREADY.
I'M OUT.

00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,514
THANK YOU.

00:40:17,514 --> 00:40:19,483
Cuban: [ LAUGHS ]

00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:20,717
WHY WOULD YOU THANK HIM
FOR THAT?

00:40:20,717 --> 00:40:23,620
MARK, I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH YOUR PRICE POINT.

00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:27,391
I THINK THE, UH --
THE MACHINERY'S REMARKABLE.

00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:30,427
I MEAN, I LOVE MACHINERY.
I LOVE MECHANICAL STUFF.

00:40:30,427 --> 00:40:32,596
HERE'S WHERE IT FELL APART
FOR ME, THOUGH.

00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:35,599
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER
YOU'RE SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME

00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,769
WITH, UH,
MATTRESS SALESPEOPLE.

00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,337
YOU KNOW, MARK IS RIGHT.

00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:41,638
WHENEVER YOU WERE ASKED
A QUESTION,

00:40:41,638 --> 00:40:42,739
YOU WENT INTO, UH...

00:40:42,739 --> 00:40:44,608
SALES MODE.
...COLORING IT.

00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,576
AND YOU WENT
INTO SALES MODE.

00:40:46,576 --> 00:40:47,644
I LIKE THE SIZZLE,

00:40:47,644 --> 00:40:51,515
BUT I WANT TO GET
RIGHT INTO THE STEAK,

00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:55,852
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU WORKED
AT NASA AS AN ENGINEER.

00:40:55,852 --> 00:40:58,555
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY,
SOMEBODY TURNED YOU.

00:40:58,555 --> 00:41:02,759
I THINK I WANTED MORE.
I DIDN'T GET MORE.

00:41:02,759 --> 00:41:03,694
I'M OUT.

00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:05,595
THANK YOU.

00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,336
LORI, CAN I ASK YOU,
UM, WHAT YOUR OBJECTION WAS?

00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:14,638
WAS IT THAT I DIDN'T GET
TO YOUR QUESTION FAST ENOUGH,

00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,341
OR IS IT THE FUNDAMENTALS
OF THE BUSINESS AND THE PRODUCT?

00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:20,811
MARK, I ASKED YOU A QUESTION.
YOU DIDN'T ANSWER IT.

00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,747
THEY STARTED TO TALK.
YOU STARTED TO TURN TO THEM.

00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:26,717
SO I STARTED TO SHOUT TO YOU
MY QUESTION --

00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:29,653
"WHOA! HEY! OVER HERE!
CAN YOU ANSWER THAT?"

00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:32,823
YOU TURNED DOWN THERE SOMEWHERE
TO DO SOMETHING ELSE.

00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:35,826
I SAID,
"HELLO? ANSWER ME."
WELL, LORI, WHY DON'T YOU
GET OVER IT 'CAUSE --

00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,561
WAIT, WAIT.
NO, I'M NOT GONNA GET OVER IT.

00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:39,496
IF YOU VALUED ME,

00:41:39,496 --> 00:41:42,532
YOU WOULD'VE ANSWERED BACK
MY QUESTIONS.

00:41:42,532 --> 00:41:44,468
SEND HER A LOVE LETTER.
AND YOU WOULD'VE SAID,
"I'LL ANSWER YOU GUYS

00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:45,769
IN A MINUTE."
BARBARA, KNOCK IT OFF.

00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:47,704
I THINK SHE'S --
SHE'S MAKING A GOOD POINT.
...IF IT WAS IMPORTANT.

00:41:47,704 --> 00:41:50,741
SO I FEEL LIKE THAT'S NOT
THE RIGHT PARTNER FOR ME.
I'M REALLY SORRY
FOR THAT, LORI.

00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:53,677
Corcoran: BUT, LORI, EVERYONE
WAS SHOUTING HIM AT ONCE.
AND IN FACT,
WHEN I CAME OUT HERE, I THOUGHT

00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:56,713
YOU WERE ONE OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT SHARKS FOR THIS.
MARK, ARE YOU STILL HERE?

00:41:56,713 --> 00:41:59,583
SO, CAN I GO THROUGH A LIST
OF, UH, RETAILERS?

00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:00,584
I THINK WE'RE ALL OUT.

00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:01,618
WE'RE ALL OUT, MARK.

00:42:01,618 --> 00:42:03,553
YOU HAD YOUR SHOT.

00:42:06,656 --> 00:42:10,427
OKAY.
THANK YOU.

00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:15,599
IT'S A TOUGH CROWD IN THERE.

00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,369
I'M GONNA PROVE KEVIN WRONG.
THIS PRODUCT IS GONNA BE HUGE.

00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:22,406
YOU'RE GONNA SEE IT IN RETAILERS
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY,

00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:24,641
AND I'M GONNA BE HAPPY
TO BE THAT BIG DEAL

00:42:24,641 --> 00:42:25,622
THAT GOT AWAY FROM THE TANK.
