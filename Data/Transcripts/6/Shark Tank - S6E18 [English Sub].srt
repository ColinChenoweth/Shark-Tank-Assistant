00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:05,425
WHAT DO YOU NEED
THE $750,000 FOR?

00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,093
WELL, $750,000 --

00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,361
WE -- WE PLAN TO KEEP
HALF OF IT

00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,230
'CAUSE WE'VE NEVER TAKEN
DIVIDENDS.

00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,432
AND WE JUST STARTED TAKING
SALARIES LAST YEAR.

00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,034
YOU MEAN YOU JUST
WANT TO TAKE MY MONEY

00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:15,068
AND GIVE IT TO YOURSELF?
REALLY?

00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:16,303
Cuban:
I ADMIRE THE HONESTY,

00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:18,271
BUT THAT'S [Chuckling] SUCH
A BAD THING TO SAY TO THEM.

00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,373
GUYS, YEAH, I THINK, UH -- LOOK,
YOU GET CREDIT FOR BEING HONEST,

00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:23,243
BUT THE REALITY IS, YOU HAVE
THE CASH FLOW TO PAY YOURSELF.

00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:26,246
YOU COULD GO TO THE BANK AND
BORROW AGAINST YOUR CASH FLOW.

00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:28,315
I'M NOT BUYING
THAT YOU NEED US.

00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,417
THIS IS A GREAT
P.R. OPPORTUNITY.

00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:34,020
YOU'RE SMART FOR TRYING
TO DO IT, BUT YOU DON'T NEED US.

00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,056
I'M OUT.

00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:39,326
GUYS, RATHER THAN DEBATE
THE MERITS

00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:43,296
OR THE REASON YOU'RE HERE,
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.

00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,366
I'M NOT GONNA PUT IN $750,000
FOR EQUITY.

00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:48,001
I'M GONNA MAKE IT DEBT.

00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,970
BUT YOU KNOW,
BEFORE I GET DETAILED,

00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,371
LET'S SEE WHO'S REALLY
INTERESTED

00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,106
TO SEE
WHO I'M COMPETING WITH.

00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:54,174
WHO'S IN ON THIS THING?

00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:57,377
I DON'T UNDERSTAND [Chuckling]
HOW YOU GUYS

00:07:57,377 --> 00:08:01,114
HAVE DONE SO MUCH MONEY WORTH
OF THIS DOG TREAT.

00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:03,316
DOGS LIKE IT.
I MEAN, IT'S JUST MIND--
MIND-BLOWING TO ME.

00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,285
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT,

00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:07,387
SO I'LL SPARE YOU
A LONG EXPLANATION,

00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:09,222
AND I'LL JUST TELL YOU
I'M OUT.

00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,424
DAYMOND, ARE YOU
INTERESTED OR NOT?

00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:14,060
I'M NOT INTERESTED
AT THE MOMENT.

00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,228
I'M OUT.

00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,032
Cuban:
LOOK, I'M INTERESTED.

00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:21,401
I'M NOT INTERESTED
AT A $15 MILLION VALUE,

00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,003
BUT I'M INTERESTED.

00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,304
ALL RIGHT, LET ME THROW
AN OFFER OUT THERE.

00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:26,373
WE'LL SEE IF OTHERS WANT TO JOIN
OR THEY WANT TO COMPETE.

00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:28,975
BUT THEY'RE NOT WORTH
$8 MILLION TO ME, KEVIN.
I DIDN'T --

00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,945
I AGREE. SO HANG ON.
HANG ON, ROBERT.
I THINK THEY'RE WORTH
$6 MILLION.

00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:33,213
LET ME WORK
SOMETHING HERE.
HERE'S THE THING --

00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:34,280
IT'S NOT ONLY
ABOUT THIS PRODUCT.

00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,016
YOU WANT TO HEAR AN OFFER,
OR YOU WANT TO TALK?

00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,386
ALL RIGHT.

00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:41,354
I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE WORTH $15 MILLION,

00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,456
AND I THINK ALL THE SHARKS
ARE IN THE SAME BOAT ON THAT,

00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,258
BUT I LIKE THE FACT
THAT IT HAS SALES.

00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:48,194
SO, YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU

00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,130
TAKE OUR CASH
OUT OF THE BUSINESS.

00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,398
NO BANK'S
GONNA LET YOU DO IT.

00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:53,199
I APPRECIATE
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO,

00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,434
BUT THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:56,436
I WOULD LIKE TO SPEND
THE $750,000

00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:59,005
TOWARDS BUILDING CAPACITY,

00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:02,108
SO I'M GONNA LEND YOU
$750,000 AT 10%.

00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:04,444
IT'LL BE OUT THERE
FOR 36 MONTHS -- 3 YEARS --

00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:06,946
AND YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME
5% EQUITY

00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:08,948
BECAUSE YOU WANT A SHARK
ON YOUR TEAM.

00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,017
SO, THIS IS CALLED
VENTURE DEBT.

00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,419
YOUR COMPANY
IS IDEAL FOR IT

00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:15,088
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE TO AGREE
ON VALUATION, ALL RIGHT?

00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,257
Herjavec: KEVIN, I LIKE
YOUR DEAL, BUT 5% ISN'T ENOUGH.

00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:19,359
CAN I COME IN WITH YOU,
AND WE GET 10%?

00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,394
DONE.
OKAY.

00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,030
YOU GET TWO SHARKS.

00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,298
IF YOUR OFFER STANDS,
CAN WE GO BACK

00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,067
AND TALK AND COME BACK
REALLY QUICK?

00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,202
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU LEAVE THE CARPET.

00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:33,306
GO AHEAD. GO AHEAD.

00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:39,012
IT'S NOT THE CASH HERE --
WE WANT THE RELATIONSHIP,

00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:41,381
BUT THE EQUITY IS TOO HIGH --
10% WITH NO MONEY.

00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:44,184
PUT $250,000, YOU MAKE 10%
ON YOUR MONEY FOR 36 MONTHS.

00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:45,385
THAT'S FANTASTIC.
36 MONTHS --

00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:47,087
Greiner:
AND THEN 5% EQUITY.

00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,421
AND THEN THAT'S --
10%, 10%.

00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,256
10% EQUITY.
NO, NO,
WE NEED 5% EACH.

00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,192
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT --
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED.

00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:55,095
OH, THAT WOULD BE 15--
BECAUSE THEY LEFT THE TANK,
THEY GOT SCREWED.

00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:58,031
WELCOME BACK, GUYS.
THANK YOU.

00:09:58,031 --> 00:10:01,000
SO, WHAT HAPPENS IN THE TANK
WHEN PEOPLE LEAVE THE CARPET

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,001
IS THE WATERS SWIRL.

00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,269
YOU KNOW.
YOU'VE SEEN THE SHOW.

00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,271
LORI EXPRESSED INTEREST
IN IT.

00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,207
THAT MEANS
YOU GET 3 SHARKS,

00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:10,143
AND NOW WE'RE ASKING
FOR 15% EQUITY.

00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:13,379
WHEN YOU HAVE THREE SHARKS
IN A COMPANY LIKE THIS,

00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:15,949
A LOT OF GOOD THINGS
CAN HAPPEN.

00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:19,085
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE A SHERPA
WHEN YOU'RE IN BUSINESS, RIGHT?
[ LAUGHS ]

00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,454
THEY DEFINITELY WILL.
YOU GOT THREE SHERPAS!

00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:25,425
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:38,138
Narrator:
TWO SHARKS ARE OUT.

00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:41,074
KEVIN, LORI, AND ROBERT
HAVE ONE OFFER ON THE TABLE --

00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:43,376
$750,000 AS A LOAN

00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:47,147
FOR 15% EQUITY OF THE HIMALAYAN
DOG CHEW COMPANY.

00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:51,017
WHEN YOU HAVE THREE SHARKS
IN A COMPANY LIKE THIS,

00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:52,218
A LOT OF GOOD THINGS
CAN HAPPEN.

00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:55,321
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

00:10:57,457 --> 00:11:02,095
[ SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ]

00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,431
YEAH, WE HAVE TO HUMBLY --
HUMBLY DECLINE THAT.

00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,367
Greiner: WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM
WITH THE DEAL?

00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:09,169
YOU DON'T LIKE
THAT IT'S A DEBT DEAL?

00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,204
EXACTLY. WE -- WE HAVE A MILLION
DOLLARS IN LINE OF CREDIT,

00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:13,039
WHICH IS, UH -- WE HAVE --
WE DON'T EVEN USE IT.

00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,440
SO WHY DON'T YOU ASK US
TO LOWER THE INTEREST RATE?

00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,109
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
THEY DON'T NEED IT.

00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:17,343
MARK, WHY ARE YOU MAKING
NOISE OVER THERE?

00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,312
WHY WOULD THEY GIVE UP EQUITY
WHEN THEY GET THE LOAN FOR FREE?

00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:21,247
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO
SEE THEM BE STUPID.

00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,183
COME ON! YOU DON'T EVEN WANT TO
GIVE THEM A DIME!

00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,350
GOSH.

00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,189
CAN WE DO $750,000
FOR 10%?

00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,457
BUT IS IT DEBT,
OR IS IT EQUITY?
STRAIGHT EQUITY.

00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,026
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN THAT DEAL.

00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,160
YEAH, I WANT TO DO
THE DEBT, GUYS.

00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,363
THEY CUT THEIR VALUATION
IN HALF, GUYS.

00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,065
HEY, IT'S -- I'M NOT --
MARK, THEN WHY DON'T YOU

00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:40,233
GET BACK IN?
THEY WENT FROM 5% TO 10%.

00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:42,035
WHY DON'T YOU DO
THAT DEAL?
I'M JUST ARBITRATING --

00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,269
YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS ARE
ARGUING ABOUT SEMANTICS.

00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:44,270
THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU.

00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,039
BUT AT THIS POINT,
IT'S NOT USEFUL.

00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,440
YEAH, WE'VE ALREADY
CUT DOWN OUR VALUATION,

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,175
LIKE WHAT MARK SAID,
TO HALF OF IT.

00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:52,178
DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR VALUE
IS WHEN YOU'RE GETTING DEBT.

00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:53,413
W-WE CAN GIVE YOU A --

00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:56,082
WE CAN DO A-A BIGGER PERCENTAGE
OF EQUITY FOR MORE MONEY --

00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:59,452
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING LIKE
MAYBE 20% FOR $1.5 MILLION?

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,156
YOU KNOW, HONESTLY,
I WENT IN

00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:06,059
BECAUSE KEVIN AND ROBERT
CONVINCED ME

00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,327
WITH THE ORIGINAL OFFER.

00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:11,364
BUT I DON'T LIKE THE COUNTER,
SO I'M OUT.

00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:15,134
IF I HAD ANY INTEREST IN BEING
IN THE DOG-CHEW BUSINESS,

00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,269
YOU'RE MAKING A GOOD OFFER.

00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:17,403
MARK, IF IT'S SO GREAT,
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE IT?

00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,038
I DON'T WANT TO BE
IN THE DOG-CHEW BUSINESS.

00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,040
THIS IS
SO FRUSTRATING.
YOU GUYS ARE BEING CRAZY.

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,209
MARK'S BECOMING LIKE
THE NARRATOR OF THE SHARK TANK.

00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,245
WE HAD A LOT OF NOISE
OUT OF MR. CUBAN.

00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:28,214
HE'S GOOD AT MAKING NOISE, BUT
HE WOULDN'T WRITE YOU A CHECK.

00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:30,283
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:33,152
YES, FOR THE EQUITY.
UH, NO FOR THE LOAN.

00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,454
I DON'T THINK ANY OF US
ARE INTERESTED, ARE WE?

00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,125
AW. I'M OUT.

00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,296
I'LL DO THE $750,000
ON MY OWN FOR 15%.

00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,399
THAT'S ONE-THIRD
OF WHAT...

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,433
[ SCOFFS ]

00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,335
THAT'S ALMOST LIKE ONE-THIRD
OF WHAT --

00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,971
YOU WANTED
A STRAIGHT EQUITY DEAL.

00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,339
[ SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ]

00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:59,078
WELL, THE TEAM SAYS NO
TO THAT DEAL, ROBERT.

00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:00,113
I'M OUT.

00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,353
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
NAMASTE.

00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:10,189
NAMASTE.
NAMASTE.

00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:14,093
WELL, WE TRIED.
WE USED...

00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,194
IT'S TOO MUCH.

00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:17,030
BY THE TIME THEY GOT
TO THE LAST OFFER,

00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,264
THAT WAS A GOOD DEAL
FROM THEM.

00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,199
MARK, YOU KEEP
DOING GOOD DEALS.

00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:21,367
I'LL DO SPECTACULAR DEALS.

00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,036
THANK YOU.
[ LAUGHS ]

00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:25,171
WE DIDN'T WANT TO,
UH, DEVALUE OUR COMPANY

THE WAY THE SHARKS
WANTED TO OFFER.

00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,274
UH, FROM THIS DAY
ON FORWARD,

00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,143
WE JUST HAVE TO WORK
A LITTLE BIT HARDER --

00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,412
UM, ACTUALLY HARDER
THAN EVER BEFORE --

00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:36,316

WERE CAPABLE OF THAT VALUATION.

YOU KNOW, IT'S LIPSTICK.

00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:17,209
I'M OUT.

00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,014
IF YOU'RE WALKING PAST
A COUNTER,

00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:23,983
AND THERE'S
A LOT OF DIFFERENT BRANDS,

00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:27,353
EVEN THE LIPS
ON THE MARTINI GLASS ARE RED.

00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:30,089
MM-HMM.
IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU HAVE CRAZY COLORS.

00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:34,293
LOOK, I GET THAT IF SOMEBODY
WEARS A SHOCKING LIPSTICK

00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,428
THAT MAKES THEM STAND OUT,
THAT'S A SIGN OF CONFIDENCE.

00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:38,230
YES.
YOU KNOW?
THEY'RE WILLING TO SAY,

00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,065
"I KNOW PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE
LOOKING AT ME.

00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:42,201
I DON'T CARE. THIS IS WHO I AM."
THAT'S GREAT.

00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:44,270
BUT YOU KIND OF WENT
COCKTAIL-THEMATIC,

00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,372
WHICH REALLY
ISN'T THE SAME THING

00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:48,374
AS BEING
OVER-THE-TOP CONFIDENT.

00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:50,142
I'M OUT.

00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,344
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:54,980
THERE'S ONLY ONE SHARK
LEFT -- LORI.

00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:59,285
Greiner: LISTEN, YOU GUYS.
I USED TO SELL MAKEUP.

00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:02,421
MAKEUP IS A GREAT THING TO SELL
FOR ONE REASON --

00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,990
IT HAS GREAT MARGINS.

00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,360
ON THE FLIP SIDE, IT'S ONE
OF THE HARDEST THINGS TO SELL

00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,430
BECAUSE IT HAS SUCH
INCREDIBLE COMPETITION.

00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,033
I'M OUT.

00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:17,303
SEE YOU GUYS.
SO LONG.

00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:18,304
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:23,008
Speers: WE'RE A LITTLE SAD,
A LITTLE HEARTBROKEN

00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,109
BECAUSE
WE BUILT THIS BABY

00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,045
AND THEY KIND OF, LIKE,
JUST SHOT IT DOWN.

00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:27,079
BUT WE'RE
GONNA KEEP GOING,

00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,214
AND WE'RE GONNA BE
A MAJOR BRAND,

00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:30,049
AND THEY'LL SEE US,
AND THEY'LL BE PROUD OF US.

00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:31,283
ROWR!

00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,496
Narrator: NEXT UP IS A PRODUCT
THAT'S BUILT NOT TO SPILL.

00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,341
[ CHUCKLES ]

00:22:55,341 --> 00:22:56,408
OH, NO.
[ CHUCKLES ]

00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:59,078
THAT IS JUST NASTY.

00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:02,081
UGH.
[ LAUGHS ]

00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:03,115
THAT IS NOT ATTRACTIVE.

00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:05,985
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:08,187
HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME'S KEVIN WALTERMIRE.

00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:11,490
I'M HERE TO ASK $50,000

00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:15,327
FOR A 15% EQUITY STAKE
IN MY COMPANY, BeverageBoy.

00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:18,163
ENVISION A SCENARIO
WE'VE ALL SEEN BEFORE --

00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:20,432
A GUY ENJOYING HIMSELF,
RELAXING IN A POOL,

00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:24,203
HAVING THE TIME OF HIS LIFE --
UNTIL HE GETS DISTRACTED...

00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:28,240
OH!

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,075
...AND SPILLS HIS --
OH, NO!

00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,210
STOP THE MADNESS.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:34,113
AND SPILLS HIS DRINK
ALL OVER HIMSELF,

00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:35,948
JUST RUINING HIS DAY.

00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:38,450
THANKFULLY, THE BevBoy IS HERE
TO SAVE THE DAY.

00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,386
THANK GOODNESS.

00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:44,156
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:48,360
THE BevBoy WILL MIRACULOUSLY
FLOAT IN WATER WITHOUT SPILLING.

00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:53,332
THINK OF IT AS YOUR VERY OWN
PERSONAL FLOATING SIDEKICK.

00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:54,466
PEOPLE WILL TAKE NOTICE

00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,135
THAT YOU'RE DIFFERENT
AT THE POOL PARTY.

00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:58,137
YOU TAKE THINGS
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

00:23:58,137 --> 00:24:00,372
IF THEIR MOTTO
IS "WORK HARD, PLAY HARD,"

00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:03,342
YOUR MOTTO IS
"WORK HARD, PLAY HARDER."

00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:05,210
BOO-YAH.
BOO-YAH.

00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,046
HELP ME SAVE THE DAY.

00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:10,149
INVEST IN BeverageBoy
AND FLOAT WITH ME.

00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,985
KEVIN, CAN WE SEE THEM?

00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:14,453
I'D LOVE TO SHOW YOU
SOME SAMPLES.

00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,056
AND CAN LORI GET IN THE HOT TUB
WITH YOUR FRIEND?

00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:18,290
OF COURSE.
THE MORE, THE MERRIER.

00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,259
IT'S A PARTY.
GO, LORI.

00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:23,162
AND I'LL EXPLAIN
HOW IT WORKS TO YOU.

00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:26,165
THE WEIGHTED EXTENSION GIVES IT
A CENTER OF GRAVITY,

00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:28,200
SO NO MATTER IF IT BOBS
LEFT OR RIGHT

00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,069
OR IF IT RIDES OVER A WAVE,
IT ALWAYS COMES BACK TO CENTER.

00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:31,437
Greiner:
PRETTY GOOD IDEA.
THAT'S THE PHYSICS OF IT.

00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:33,305
DID YOU CREATE
THIS YOURSELF?
PRETTY COOL.

00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,275
YOU KNOW WHAT? IT WAS ACTUALLY
A GREAT COLLEGE POOL PARTY.

00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:39,378
WE'RE ALL HANGING OUT,
AND A FRIEND OF OURS
FELL OFF OF A RAFT.

00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:41,413
AND I JUST HAD A MOMENT
AND WAS LIKE, "LOOK,

00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:44,316
IF WE HAVE RAFTS, WHY DON'T
OUR DRINKS HAVE RAFTS?"

00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,052
WHERE ARE YOU SELLING IT?
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU SOLD?

00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:52,257
I'VE SOLD, UH, 2,500 UNITS,
SO ABOUT $10,500 IN REVENUE.

00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:58,364
AND I'M IN STORES
FROM MASSACHUSETTS TO TEXAS.

00:24:58,364 --> 00:24:59,465
OVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME,
KEVIN?

00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:00,466
UH, THE LAST SIX MONTHS.

00:25:00,466 --> 00:25:02,968
OH, YOU --
THIS IS BRAND-NEW.
YES.

00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:06,271
IS THIS LIKE THE MODERN-DAY'S
MAN VERSION OF A TASTEVIN?

00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:07,306
[ Laughing ] TASTEVIN!
Herjavec: A WHAT?

00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:09,174
INTERESTING, DAYMOND.

00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:12,277
THE CHEVALIERS DU TASTEVIN.
LOOK AT THIS.

00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:13,412
OH, MY GOD.
THEY MAY LITIGATE.

00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:15,014
HE'S GOING,
"WHAT IS THAT?"

00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:16,248
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THAT IS.

00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:17,383
O'Leary: SO, KEVIN...
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:19,284
...THE TASTEVIN
IS A DEVICE

00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:21,453
THAT'S USED TO SIP
A VERY BEAUTIFUL WINE

00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,222
FROM THE BURGUNDY REGION
OF FRANCE.

00:25:23,222 --> 00:25:25,057
I'M GLAD
YOU MENTIONED THAT.

00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:27,259
"OH, BUT THERE'S MORE."
I'VE HEARD ABOUT YOU
AND YOUR WINE,

00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:29,028
SO WE'LL POUR YOU
ONE OF YOUR --

00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,329
MAYBE A FINE BORDEAUX
FOR YOU.

00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:32,398
YEAH.
AND WE'RE JUST GONNA
DROP IT IN WATER,

00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:34,400
AND NOW YOU CAN PARTY,
TOO, MR. WONDERFUL.

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,335
LOOK AT THAT.
I WILL TELL THE CONFRéRIE.

00:25:36,335 --> 00:25:38,203
[ LAUGHS ]
Greiner:
SO, WHAT DOES THIS COST,

00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,304
AND WHAT DOES IT COST
TO MAKE?

00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:43,442
IT COSTS ME ABOUT $2.
I WHOLESALE IT AT $5.

00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:45,377
MY RETAILERS RETAIL IT
AT $9.99.

00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,380
WHY AREN'T THE COLLEGE PEOPLE
ON BOARD WITH THIS?

00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,150
WHY ISN'T IT TAKING OFF
A LITTLE BIT MORE?

00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,985
YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY THINK
IT'S MY FAILURE

00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:54,286
TO GET IT OUT
IN FRONT OF THE RIGHT PEOPLE.

00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,121
KEVIN, THAT'S WHERE
I'M GOING.
HAVE YOU DONE TRADE SHOWS?

00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:58,190
I HAVE.
AND -- AND
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,359
I WENT TO THE, UH,
PROMOTIONAL-PRODUCTS SHOW

00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:02,194
IN CHICAGO
A FEW MONTHS AGO --

00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:04,296
SOLD OUT OF EVERY UNIT
I TOOK THERE.

00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:06,432
YEAH, BUT DID YOU -- DID YOU
GET ANY ORDERS IN STORES?

00:26:06,432 --> 00:26:08,200
SO WHAT STORES
GAVE YOU ORDERS?

00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,036
ACTUALLY, SO, I DIDN'T BRING
ANY ORDER FORMS TO THOSE SHOWS.

00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:14,239
IT WAS JUST AN EXCHANGE
OF INFORMATION.

00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,408
HOW COULD YOU NOT BRING
AN ORDER FORM TO A TRADE SHOW?

00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,410
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.
A MENTOR OF MINE TOLD ME

00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,979
IT WAS MORE ABOUT GETTING
THE PRODUCT OUT THERE.

00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:23,082
IT'S A TRADE SHOW.
BUT I TAKE THEIR BUSINESS
INFORMATION --

00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,184
YOU KNOW WHAT, KEVIN?
ANYBODY WHO REFUSES

00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:28,287
TO TAKE AN ORDER FORM
TO A TRADE SHOW...

00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:29,288
I'M OUT.

00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:31,323
WHOA!

00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:33,158
HOW COULD YOU NOT TAKE
AN ORDER --

00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:35,994
THAT'S NOT LIKE NOT HAVING A PEN
WHEN YOU GO TO CLOSE THE DEAL.

00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:37,996
YOU KNOW, WE SEE
ALL KINDS OF CRAZY THINGS.

00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:39,298
O'Leary: I THINK
YOU'RE SEEING ONE RIGHT NOW.

00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:41,467
I N--
I NEVER JUDGE THINGS.
I DO.

00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:43,969
THEY'RE -- THEY'RE POO-POO
ON A STICK YOU GIVE AWAY.

00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:47,039
CAN YOU IMAGINE THE AMOUNT OF
PEOPLE THAT HAVE MADE A MISTAKE

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,408
AND HAVE DROPPED THEIR CAN,
THEIR CUP IN THE WATER?

00:26:49,408 --> 00:26:51,376
AND I KNOW IT'S SOMETHING
THAT YOU LAUGH AT,

00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:52,978
AND YOU THINK IT'S POO-POO,

00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:55,047
BUT WHEN YOU WATCH IT,
IT WORKS,

00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:56,381
AND IT'S HILARIOUS.
PEOPLE ENJOY USING IT.

00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:58,150
ALL RIGHT, KEVIN,
I'VE BEEN LISTENING,

00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,319
I'VE BEEN LISTENING,
AND NOW I'M SAYING THIS --

00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:03,021
YOUR NAME IS KEVIN,
MY NAME IS KEVIN --

00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:04,456
I'M OFFICIALLY STRIPPING YOU
OF YOUR NAME

00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,125
BECAUSE THIS IDEA
IS SO BAD.

00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,159
IT IS SO GOOD.

00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:09,061
IT IS SO BAD.
IT IS SO GOOD.

00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:10,462
YOU DO NOT DESERVE
THE NAME KEVIN.

00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,131
YOU ARE NOW CALLED "ZONK."

00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:14,333
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,201
I'M SORRY, MAN. I AM OUT.
THIS SUCKS.

00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,204
BY THE WAY, ZONK,
IF YOU DON'T GET A DEAL,

00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:20,973
YOU'RE LEAVING
WITH THE ZONK NAME.

00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,441
I'M NOT LEAVING WITH THE NAME,
BUT THANK YOU.

00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:25,077
LOOK, KEVIN,
THE ONLY THING THAT'S MISSING

00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:27,079
FROM YOUR ENTIRE PRESENTATION
IS YOU COME OUT,

00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:29,248
WE ALL LAUGH AT YOU,
AND THEN YOU SAY,

00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:31,250
"BUT I HAVE HALF A MILLION
DOLLARS IN SALES,"

00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:34,353
AND WE ALL GO, "WOW!"
AND THEN YOU GET A DEAL.

00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:35,454
I JUST STARTED.

00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:38,023
FOR SOME REASON,
IT'S NOT FLYING OFF THE SHELF.

00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:39,324
I'M OUT.

00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:43,028
OKAY, ZONK,
THERE'S ONLY TWO SHARKS LEFT.

00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:44,296
LORI, ARE YOU
GONNA SAVE HIM?

00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:47,032
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO JUDGE
HOW MANY PEOPLE

00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:49,134
WANT A FLOATING BEER HOLDER.
ZONK-A-TRON.

00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:51,170
A ZONK-A-TRON.
I DON'T -- I DON'T KNOW.

00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,138
THIS IS A BevBoy,
AND I'M TELLING YOU,

00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:55,040
WITH YOUR CAPABILITIES,
LORI,

00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,342
IF YOU PUT THIS ON QVC
AND PEOPLE ACTUALLY SEE IT,

00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,111
PEOPLE WILL LOVE IT.

00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:00,412
LORI, IS THERE
A QVC CUSTOMER --
I DON'T KNOW --

00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:02,047
THERE HAS NEVER BEEN
A BETTER QVC PRODUCT.

00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:03,182
I DON'T THINK
THAT THIS IS A QVC.

00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:04,416
Waltermire:
I THINK IT IS.
WHEN I LOOK AT THIS,

00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:05,417
I'M THINKING
BED BATH &amp; BEYOND,

00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:06,451
I'M THINKING TARGET,
WALMART --

00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:08,420
THOSE KIND OF PLACES.
NOPE, NOT ME. QVC.

00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,290
DAYMOND, YOU THINK THAT THIS
COULD WORK FOR PROMOTIONS?

00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,025
John: I'M KILLING IT
WITH THE 180 CUP.

00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:15,093
THAT'S THE ONE YOU TAKE
THE SHOT OUT OF THE BOTTOM --

00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:17,129
IT'S IN PARTY CITY.

00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:19,097
IT MATCHES
WHAT I'M ALREADY DOING,

00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:20,999
AND I HAVE
A PROMOTIONAL COMPANY.

00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:22,201

NO.
OH!

OKAY, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,356

SHE WAS GONNA GO FOR IT.
