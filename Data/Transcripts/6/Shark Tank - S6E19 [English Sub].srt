Narrator:
WELCOME TO THE SHARK TANK,

00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:05,005
WHERE ENTREPRENEURS
SEEK AN INVESTMENT

00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,374
TO START, GROW, OR SAVE
THEIR BUSINESS.

00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:08,408
SO, WE'VE DONE $3 MILLION
TO DATE.

00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:09,443
WOW.

00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:12,112
IT'S ABSOLUTELY,
ASTRONOMICALLY MASSIVE.

00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:13,313
ABSOLUTELY,
ASTRONOMICALLY MASSIVE?

00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:15,015
YES! YES!

00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,350
Narrator: IF THE SHARKS HEAR
A GREAT IDEA...

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,151
WE SOLD $10,000 WORTH OF PRODUCT
THE FIRST DAY.

00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:19,253
THAT'S AWESOME.

00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:21,288
Narrator: ...THEY'LL INVEST
THEIR OWN MONEY...

00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:23,323
YOU CAN ACTUALLY FIND GOLD
IN THE HOME DEPOT SAND.

00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:24,391
GOLD!

00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:26,226
Narrator: ...AND FIGHT
EACH OTHER FOR A DEAL.

00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:27,361
WOULD YOU LIKE TO PARTICIPATE
IN ONE OF THOSE,

00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,363
OR ARE YOU STUPID
AND GONNA PAY MORE THAN THAT?

00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,231
OHH!
OHH!

00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:33,467
BUT THE ENTREPRENEURS
MUST GET THE FULL AMOUNT

00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:36,069
THEY'RE ASKING FOR, OR THEY'LL
WALK AWAY WITH NOTHING.

00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:37,337
WE THINK WE'LL LOSE MONEY AGAIN
NEXT YEAR.

00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:38,372
UH-OH.

00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,240
I WOULD LOVE TO COUNTER
YOUR OFFER.

00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,275
YOU'RE JOKING.

00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:42,442
YOU'D HAVE TO GIVE ME
HALF THE COMPANY.

00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:44,344
THAT WOULD BE COMPLETELY ABSURD.
I'M SORRY.

00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,081
Narrator:
WHO ARE THE SHARKS?

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,353
THEY'RE SELF-MADE
BUSINESS EXPERTS WORTH BILLIONS.

00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:57,391
KEVIN O'LEARY IS
A SHREWD VENTURE CAPITALIST

00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,259
WHO MADE HIS FORTUNE

00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,194
SELLING A CHILDREN'S
EDUCATIONAL COMPANY

00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:03,463
FOR OVER $4 BILLION.

00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:07,367
BARBARA CORCORAN WENT
FROM WAITING TABLES IN MANHATTAN

00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:12,072
TO BUILDING THE CITY'S PREMIER
$2 BILLION REAL-ESTATE EMPIRE.

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,410
ROBERT HERJAVEC, SON OF
AN IMMIGRANT FACTORY WORKER,

00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,011
FOUNDED ONE OF

00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:21,048
THE WORLD'S PREEMINENT
CYBER-SECURITY FIRMS.

00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:25,152
LORI GREINER, THE QUEEN OF QVC,
HOLDS OVER 100 PATENTS

00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:27,254
AND HAS LAUNCHED
OVER 400 PRODUCTS,

00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:30,090
GROSSING OVER A HALF A BILLION
DOLLARS IN SALES.

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,261
AND MARK CUBAN,
RENOWNED BILLIONAIRE TECH MOGUL

00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:38,265
AND THE OUTSPOKEN OWNER
OF THE DALLAS MAVERICKS.

00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:47,975
I'M LIZ.
AND I'M BEN.

00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:49,009
AND WE'RE
FROM PORTLAND, OREGON.

00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:51,011
AND WE MET AND STARTED DATING
IN COLLEGE.

00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:53,013
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN PASSIONATE
ABOUT WOMEN'S ISSUES,

00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:55,048
SPECIFICALLY THE CHALLENGES
FACING WOMEN

00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:56,316
LIVING IN
DEVELOPING ECONOMIES.

00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,085
SO, AFTER UNIVERSITY,

00:01:58,085 --> 00:02:00,020
I TOOK A HUGE LEAP OF FAITH
AND MOVED TO UGANDA.

00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,123
THE GREATEST NEED FOR WOMEN
IN UGANDA

00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,026
IS EDUCATIONAL
AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES.

00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:07,094
SO, I DECIDED
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:09,363
LIZ ISN'T AFRAID
TO TAKE RISKS.

00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:10,998
SHE DOES THINGS
THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULDN'T DO,

00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:12,265
AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
SO IMPRESSED BY THAT.

00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,201
I DECIDED TO QUIT MY JOB
AS A CONSULTANT,

00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:15,235
AND TOGETHER,
WE'VE BUILT SOMETHING

00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:16,303
THAT WE'RE
SUPER PROUD OF.

00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:17,404
HEY, AGNES.
GOOD MORNING.

00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:19,172
Hi, Liz and Ben.

00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:22,009
OUR GENERATION IS LESS CONCERNED
ABOUT THE BIG BRAND NAME

00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:23,276
AND MORE CONCERNED
ABOUT THE IMPACT

00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,012
THAT THEIR PRODUCTS HAVE
ON THE WORLD.

00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:26,380
WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD
TO A GREAT YEAR.

00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,281
WHEN WE STARTED THE COMPANY,
WE DECIDED WHOLEHEARTEDLY

00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,283
THAT WE WANTED TO BE
A FOR-PROFIT COMPANY.

00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:33,020
WE BELIEVE THAT CREATING
ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY

00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,255
CAN HAVE A MORE LASTING IMPACT
THAN SOME CHARITIES.

00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:36,990
I THINK THAT'S
REALLY OUR SWEET SPOT.

00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,358
WE HAVE SPENT
THE LAST FIVE YEARS

00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,027
DOING
THE REALLY HARD WORK.

00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:42,062
AND NOW WE JUST NEED TO MAKE
A NAME FOR OURSELVES IN AMERICA.

00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:44,197
WE BELIEVE THAT
IF EVERY WOMAN IN AMERICA

00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:45,365
KNEW ABOUT OUR COMPANY,

00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,434
WE COULD MAKE A MASSIVE IMPACT
FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS

00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:48,435
ALL ACROSS THE GLOBE.

00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,323
HI, SHARKS.
WE'RE LIZ AND BEN BOHANNON.

00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,025

00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:18,265
WE'RE SEEKING $300,000
FOR 10% EQUITY IN OUR COMPANY.

00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:24,404
WITH SSEKO, ONE SANDAL HAS
ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES.

00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:27,074
OUR FIRST PRODUCT IS

00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:23,330
NOW, DON'T JUST
TAKE IT FROM US.

00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,432
HERE'S A MESSAGE
FROM OUR TEAM IN UGANDA.

00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:31,304
<i>SSEKO DESIGNS IS USING FASHION</i>

[ <i>WOMEN CHEERING</i> ]

00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,149
THAT WAS GREAT.
[ CHUCKLES ]

00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:44,017
NOW, WHICH ONE
OF YOU SHARKS

00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:47,320
WANTS TO BE A PART OF BUILDING
A POWERFUL, GLOBAL BRAND

00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,122
THAT WILL BE KNOWN

00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,158
BEAUTIFUL PRODUCTS
WITH BEAUTIFUL STORIES?

00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:53,393
ARE YOU INTO THIS
FOR PROFIT?

00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:57,264
YES, WE ARE ABSOLUTELY,
100% A FOR-PROFIT COMPANY.

00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:59,399
SO, YOU DONATE WHAT PERCENTAGE
OF YOUR REVENUE TO THIS --

00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,168
SO, WE DO NOT DONATE
ANYTHING.

00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:03,303
ALL OF OUR KIND OF
"PHILANTHROPY"

00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,038
COMES FROM
OUR PRODUCTION SIDE.

00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,140
YOU'RE MAKING THE SANDALS
IN UGANDA --

00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,109
THEY MAKE IT.
SO, LITERALLY, INSTEAD OF
MAKING THEM OFFSHORE IN CHINA,

00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:11,044
WE'VE SAID, "LET'S BE
REALLY INTENTIONAL

00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,379
ABOUT WHERE WE MAKE
THE PRODUCT."

00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:15,048
WE BELIEVE PASSIONATELY THAT
BUSINESS HAS A POWERFUL ROLE

00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,349
IN MAKING THE WORLD
A BETTER PLACE,

00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:17,417
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT WE'RE DOING.

00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,085
LOVE IT,
BUT IS IT CHEAPER THAN CHINA?

00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,320
IT IS COMPARABLE
TO CHINA.

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,421
WALK US --
CAN WE SEE IT?

00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:22,489
YEAH. YEAH.
LET'S -- LET'S TRY SOME --

00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,191
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
LET'S DEFINITELY --

00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:26,159
SO, THESE ARE THE ONLY TWO
SANDAL MODELS THAT WE DO HAVE.

00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,161
WE ARE EXPANDING INTO
CLOSED-TOED SHOES, AS WELL,

00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,163
BUT THE SANDALS ARE DEFINITELY
OUR MAIN PRODUCT,

00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,264
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE
BEEN SELLING TO DATE.

00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,033
Herjavec:
THEY'RE ONLY FOR WOMEN.

00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,334
HOW COMFORTABLE IS THAT
TO WEAR?
THEY'RE VERY COMFORTABLE.

00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,036
IT'S A
GENUINE-LEATHER BASE,

00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:38,138
REAL LEATHER SOURCED
FROM KENYA.

00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:40,373
IT HAS A LAYER OF MICRO FOAM
IN THE MIDDLE,

00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,108
SO IT REALLY FORMS
TO YOUR FOOT

00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,410
AFTER YOU GET DONE
WEARING IT.

00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,978
I WEAR THEM ALL DAY,
EVERY DAY.

00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:46,079
WE'VE HAD WOMEN
THAT HAVE TREKKED

00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,080
THROUGH THE AMAZON
IN THEM.

00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,248
SERIOUSLY? [ LAUGHS ]

00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:50,016
WHAT DO YOU SELL
THE SANDALS FOR?

00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,085
WE SELL ABOUT TWO PAIRS
OF RIBBONS WITH EACH BASE.

00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,287
SO, THAT'S GONNA RETAIL
FOR RIGHT AROUND $65,

00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,288
AND THE COST ON THAT --

00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,257
$65 FOR THIS,
A FLIP-FLOP?

00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:58,358
YES.

00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,327
HOW DID YOU GET INVOLVED
WITH UGANDA?

00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:02,329
I MEAN, IT'S NOT A TYPICAL THING
SOMEONE WOULD DO.

00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,998
SO, I WENT TO UNIVERSITY.
I STUDIED JOURNALISM.

00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:07,067
I WAS SUPER PASSIONATE
ABOUT WOMEN'S ISSUES,

00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:10,370
AND SO GOT OUT OF COLLEGE,
GOT MY FIRST CORPORATE JOB.

00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,072
THAT LASTED
FOR ABOUT TWO MONTHS.

00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:13,206
[ CHUCKLES ]

00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,341
WHILE I WAS SITTING
AT MY CUBICLE,

00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:16,076
I BOUGHT A ONE-WAY TICKET
TO EAST AFRICA

00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:18,144
AND DECIDED THAT I WAS GONNA
GO JUST BE ON THE GROUND

00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,213
AND LEARN ABOUT THE ISSUES
THAT WOMEN AND GIRLS FACE THERE.

00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,414
AND WHY SHOES?

00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:23,350
YOU JUST WOKE UP ONE DAY AND
SAID, "LET'S DO A SHOE COMPANY"?

00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,018
NO, SO,
WHAT HAPPENED WAS

00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:26,253
I WAS WORKING AT A
YOUTH-DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION,

00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:28,355
MET AN INCREDIBLE GROUP
OF YOUNG WOMEN BASICALLY MY AGE,

00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:30,290
BACKGROUNDS
OF EXTREME POVERTY,

00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,292
AND THEY WERE GETTING READY
TO GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL,

00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:34,060
AND THEY WERE GONNA
GO BACK TO THEIR VILLAGES

00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,195
FOR THIS
NINE-MONTH BREAK.

00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:37,097
IT'S INTENDED
TO ALLOW STUDENTS

00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:39,366
THAT ACTUALLY TEST INTO COLLEGE
TO FIND TIME TO FIND A JOB

00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:41,167
SO THAT THEY CAN PAY
FOR COLLEGE.

00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,336
SO, YOU HAVE TO PAY UP FRONT,
OR YOU'RE NOT GOING.

00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,272
BASICALLY, WHAT WAS HAPPENING
WITH THESE YOUNG WOMEN --

00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:47,307
THEY WERE GRADUATING FROM
THIS SECONDARY-SCHOOL PROGRAM,

00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:50,377
TESTING INTO COLLEGE,
HAD ALL OF THIS GUSTO AND VISION

00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:53,213
FOR WHO THEY WANTED TO BECOME
AND WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO,

00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:55,282
WERE GOING BACK TO THEIR
VILLAGES, COULDN'T FIND JOBS.

00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:57,350
AND SO I THOUGHT,
"MAN, WHAT IF

00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,153
WE COULD ACTUALLY BUILD
A MARKETPLACE SOLUTION?"

00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,222
ONE OF MY FRIENDS WAS LIKE,
"WHAT ABOUT THOSE, LIKE, FUNKY,

00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:04,257
STRAPPY SANDALS YOU WORE IN
COLLEGE THAT EVERYBODY LOVED?"

00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,360
I HAD MADE THESE SANDALS
IN COLLEGE OUT OF, LITERALLY,

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,428
FLIP-FLOP BOTTOMS
AND RIBBON.

00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,030
AND IT WAS ONE OF
THOSE THINGS WHERE,

00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,264
WHEN I WOULD WEAR IT,
PEOPLE WOULD LITERALLY

00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,033
STOP ME ON THE STREET
AND ASK ME ABOUT THEM.

00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,167
AND SO I WAS LIKE,
"OKAY, SURE, SANDALS."

00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,435
[ LAUGHS ]

00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,071
AND THEN I WENT TO THE SCHOOL
AND HIRED THREE WOMEN --

00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:19,372
MARY, MERCY,
AND REBECCA --

00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,308
AND TAUGHT THEM
HOW TO MAKE THE SANDALS

00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:23,410
AND BASICALLY SAID,
"OKAY, IF YOU PROMISE

00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,979
"TO MAKE THESE SANDALS
FOR THE NEXT NINE MONTHS,

00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,414
I PROMISE THAT YOU WILL GO
TO COLLEGE IN THE FALL."

00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:30,083
LIZ, HOW MUCH MONEY
DID THOSE THREE LADIES NEED

00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,251
TO GET TO COLLEGE?

00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:33,486
COLLEGE IS ABOUT $2,000
TO $3,000 A YEAR, SO --

00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,422
SO, YOU GUARANTEED THEM
THE $2,000 TO $3,000

00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:36,456
BEFORE YOU HAD ANY SALES.

00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,024
YEAH. YEAH.
I LOVE THAT.

00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,392
YEAH, SO, THAT'S WHEN --
WHEN I GOT HOME,

00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:42,062
ABOUT TWO DAYS LATER,
BEN PROPOSED TO ME,

00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:44,130
AND I'M THINKING,
"DO I TELL HIM

00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,099
"THAT I PROMISED THREE WOMEN
IN AFRICA

00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:47,334
I'D PAY FOR THEM
TO GO TO UNIVERSITY?"

00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:49,436
HOW MANY WOMEN
ARE THERE NOW?

00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:52,072
SO, WE'VE HAD 47 WOMEN WHO HAVE
GONE THROUGH OUR PROGRAM.

00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:53,206
WOW.
Herjavec: WOW.

00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,208
100% OF THE WOMEN
WHO HAVE GRADUATED FROM SSEKO

00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,376
HAVE GONE ON
TO UNIVERSITY

00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,278
AND HAVE EITHER GRADUATED
FROM COLLEGE

00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:01,214
OR ARE STILL PURSUING
THEIR DEGREES.
GOOD FOR YOU. THAT'S AWESOME.

00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,983
YOU'RE IN RETAIL. DO YOU HAVE
SALES? WHERE ARE YOU?

00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,317
Ben: SO, WE'VE DONE $3 MILLION
TO DATE.

00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,152
THIS YEAR, WE'LL DO
$1.1 MILLION.

00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,321
AND WHAT WILL YOU MAKE
ON THAT $1.1 MILLION?

00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,291
2009, '10, '11, AND '12,
WE WERE PROFITABLE.

00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,159
OKAY, BUT THIS YEAR?

00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,095
SO, ONCE WE HIT A POINT
IN UGANDA WHERE WE SAID,

00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:16,129
"HEY, WE CAN SCALE THIS"...
OH, NICE, LORI.

00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:17,197
..."LET'S GO,
LET'S GROW IT,

00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:18,365
"LET'S GET INTO
MAJOR DISTRIBUTION,

00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,266
LET'S GET INTO
MAJOR RETAILERS," WE --

00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,235
IN 2012,
WE OPENED A DEBT ROUND.

00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,037
WE DID $250,000 IN DEBT

00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:26,272
SO THAT WE COULD GO OUT
AND HIRE OUR FIRST SALESPEOPLE.

00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,308
AND HOW MUCH MONEY
ARE YOU MAKING NOW?

00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:31,177
WE'LL RUN A LOSS THIS YEAR
OF RIGHT AROUND $90,000.

00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,412
WHAT ABOUT NEXT YEAR?

00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:34,280
NEXT YEAR, THE GOAL IS
TO DO $1.9 MILLION.

00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,949
AND WHAT ARE YOU GONNA MAKE
ON THAT?

00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,083
WE THINK WE'LL LOSE MONEY AGAIN
NEXT YEAR.

00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:41,087
WHY ARE YOU LOSING SO MUCH MONEY
ON $1.9 MILLION?
WHY ARE YOU LOSING MONEY
ON $1.9 MILLION?

00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,089
YEAH. SO, THE --
I MEAN, THE BIGGEST THING --

00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,125
WE'RE ADD-- WE'RE STILL GONNA
CONTINUE TO ADD SALESPEOPLE.

00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,493
CAN YOU TELL ME
HOW MUCH SALARY YOU'RE TAKING?

00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:49,129
WE'RE RIGHT AROUND $45,000
AS A PACKAGE DEAL RIGHT NOW.

00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:50,196
COMBINED?
TOTAL?

00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,197
YEAH.

00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,000
SO, HOW DO I GET
TO $3 MILLION...

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,002
YEAH.
...FOR SSEKO?

00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,337
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

00:08:57,337 --> 00:09:00,006
SO, WE THINK IT'S --
IT'S VERY FAIR TO LOOK AT --

00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,207
WE'RE EVEN LOOKING
AT LAST YEAR'S NUMBERS --

00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,076
SO, TAKING
LIKE A $2.7 MULTIPLE

00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:04,411
ON OUR REVENUE
FROM LAST YEAR.

00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:07,347
YOU WANT TO VALUE IT ON REVENUE
AND NOT PROFIT?

00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:08,982
AND THAT'S A --
THAT'S A NORMAL THING,

00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,150
TO VALUE SOMETHING
ON REVENUE.

00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,351
ESPECIALLY WHEN
YOU'RE A BRAND.

00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,119
WHEN YOU'RE IN THE BRAND SPACE
OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING --

00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,454
BUT YOU'RE NOT A BRAND. I'VE
NEVER HEARD OF YOU TILL NOW.

00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:16,356
WELL, YOU WILL.

00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:20,326
LAST YEAR ON "SHARK TANK,"
WE HAD A MOST ENDEARING COUPLE

00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,429
HERE WHO OWNED A BUSINESS
NAMED GRACE AND LACE.

00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:25,198
THEY MAKE THESE ADORABLE LITTLE
LACE LINERS FOR YOUR BOOTS.

00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:27,267
Ben: MM-HMM.
IT'S AN
INTERESTING PARALLEL.

00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:31,037
THEIR PHILOSOPHY WAS
THEY BELIEVED IN HELPING PEOPLE,

00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,973
AND THEIR INTENTION WAS TO TAKE
WHATEVER PROFITS THEY HAD

00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:37,143
AND SPEND HALF OF THAT PROFIT
IMMEDIATELY ON HELPING PEOPLE.

00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,145
THEY SOLD
$1 MILLION WORTH OF SOCKS

00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:41,081
WITHIN A WEEK
OF "SHARK TANK."

00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,316
IT'S EXACTLY ONE YEAR LATER,

00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:46,319
AND THEY WILL HAVE
$10 MILLION IN SALES.

00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:49,022
THAT'S AWESOME.
BUT HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE
THAT DISTURBS ME --

00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:53,193
THEY WERE <i>HYPER-FOCUSED</i>
ON PROFIT FIRST.

00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:56,162
THEY WERE FOCUSED
ON CHARITY SECOND.

00:09:56,162 --> 00:10:00,066
NOW THEY, FORTUNATELY, HAVE
BUILT THREE ORPHANAGES IN INDIA.

00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,035
YEAH. YEAH.

00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:07,207
BUT I WAS ABLE TO MAKE $400,000
ON $40,000.

00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:08,408
YEAH. WITH --
I'M A HAPPY INVESTOR.

00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:10,243
YEAH, YOU SHOULD BE.

00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:14,147
IT'S VERY HARD TO BUY
INTO SOMEONE'S PHILOSOPHY

00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:16,216
IF THERE ARE PROJECTED LOSSES

00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:19,052
WITHOUT CLARITY AS TO HOW
YOU'RE GONNA GET TO PROFIT.

00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:21,354
I WAS HOPING YOU WERE
MY NEXT GRACE AND LACE.

00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,456
YEAH.
BUT I'M SORRY TO SAY
I'M OUT.

00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,092
THANKS, BARBARA.
THANKS, BARBARA.

00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,227
HERE'S WHAT
I WILL SAY --

00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:29,462
WE ARE MORE DRIVEN
TO MAKE MONEY

00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,297
AND TO MAKE
THIS BUSINESS WORK

00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,266
THAN WE WOULD BE
IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT.

00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:35,335
GUYS, LOOK, I DON'T QUESTION
YOUR PROFIT MOTIVATION.

00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:37,070
IT'S THERE.
IT'S OBVIOUS.

00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,272
WHAT I LOOK FOR
ARE CERTAIN KEYWORDS

00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:42,408
THAT TELL ME
HOW REALISTIC YOU ARE,

00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:43,977
BECAUSE,
AS ENTREPRENEURS,

00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,178
YOU'RE NOT ALWAYS REALISTIC,
RIGHT?
YEP.

00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:46,279
YOU LIE TO YOURSELF.
YOU GET ALL EXCITED.

00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,014
YOU GET ALL FIRED UP.
YEAH.

00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,382
BUT AT SOME POINT,
YOU HAVE TO BE REALISTIC

00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,117
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO PAY
THE BILLS, RIGHT?

00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,052
YEAH, WE WERE
TOP-5 SOCIAL ENTERPRISES

00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,154
BY <i>BLOOMBERG</i> MAGAZINE.

00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,022
I MEAN,
WE'RE A SOCIAL INNOVATION.

00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,090
WE WERE AT
THE WHITE HOUSE, LIKE --

00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,458
YOU'RE -- YOU'RE ACTUALLY
MAKING MY POINT.

00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:01,194
ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS YOU'VE
BEEN RECOGNIZED FOR, RIGHT?
YEP.

00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:04,130
ALL THE PEOPLE
THAT YOU'VE HIRED TO SELL,

00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,333
AND THAT'S ONLY GOTTEN YOU
TO $1.1 MILLION IN SALES.

00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,102
YEP.
RIGHT?

00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:11,304
I JUST DON'T SEE
THE CAUSE AND EFFECT,

00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:14,174
AND I SEE A LOT
OF SELF-PROMOTION

00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,075
THAT DOESN'T GET ME
FROM HERE

00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:17,977
TO WHERE I THINK
YOU GUYS WANT TO GO.

00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:19,312
AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.

00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:22,048
OKAY. THANKS, MAN.

00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:29,322
YOU KNOW, YOU ARE NOT WORTH
$3 MILLION BY <i>ANY</i> MEASURE.

00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:31,291
I'M SORRY.

00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,993
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF
SHOE COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD.

00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:35,995
THEY ALL TRADE PRETTY WELL
IN THE SAME RANGE,

00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:37,463
LOTS OF COMPETITION.

00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:42,402
I THINK YOU'RE WORTH SOMEWHERE
AROUND $700,000, ALL-IN.

00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:45,104
YOU'D HAVE TO GIVE ME
HALF THE COMPANY.

00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:46,439
UH-OH.

00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:00,453
Narrator: TWO SHARKS ARE OUT.

00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:04,123
LIZ AND BEN ONLY HAVE THREE MORE
CHANCES TO MAKE A DEAL

00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:07,060
FOR THEIR INTERCHANGEABLE SANDAL
COMPANY, SSEKO.

00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:14,033
I THINK YOU'RE WORTH SOMEWHERE
AROUND $700,000, ALL-IN.

00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:15,235
YOU'D HAVE TO GIVE ME
HALF THE COMPANY.

00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:20,073
WE'RE NEVER GONNA GET TO A DEAL,
SO I'M OUT.

00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:24,410
WE ALL HAVE
DIFFERENT EXPERTISE HERE.

00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,213
I'M REALLY GOOD
AT TAKING A SMALL COMPANY

00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,349
AND MAKING IT BIG
IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME.

00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,284
WHEN YOU'RE THIS SMALL,

00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:35,121
YOU WANT TO INVEST
<i>AFTER</i> THE SALES COME IN.

00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:38,124
YOU WANT TO INVEST
TO <i>SUPPORT</i> THE SALES,

00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,326
NOT INVEST <i>AHEAD</i>
OF THE SALES.

00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:46,332
YOU'RE TELLING ME, "I HAD TO
INCREASE MY SALES COSTS BY 30%

00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:51,971
TO GET 20% MORE IN SALES AT SUCH
A SMALL AMOUNT OF $1 MILLION."

00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,206
MM-HMM.

00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:56,042
I DON'T SEE
HOW YOU'RE GONNA SCALE

00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:58,044
WITHOUT
BUYING YOUR WAY THERE.

00:12:58,044 --> 00:13:00,346
GREAT CAUSE...BUT I'M OUT.

00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:04,217
Greiner:
I LOVE THE MISSION.

00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:09,355
I LOVE THE LOOK -- REALLY CUTE.

00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,457
BUT I PUT IT ON,

00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:16,296
AND I HAD SOME DIFFICULTY
WITH IT BEING COMFORTABLE ON ME

00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:19,032
BECAUSE THE RIBBON CAN CUT IN.

00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:20,400
DEPENDING ON
WHICH WAY YOU DO IT,

00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,968
IT CAN CUT INTO YOUR FOOT.

00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,336
SO, I'M JUST SAYING,
ME PERSONALLY,

00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:26,339
I HAD SOME DIFFICULTY
WITH THE RIBBON STYLE.

00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,975
I'M SURE, FOR A LOT OF WOMEN,
THIS IS COMFORTABLE.

00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,343
YOU'VE SOLD A LOT.

00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:32,445
BUT FOR ME, IT WASN'T.

00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:36,416
AND I BELIEVE IN YOUR MISSION,
BUT I DON'T THE PRODUCT,

00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,018
AND FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.

00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,354
CONGRATULATIONS, GUYS.

00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:42,388
BYE. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:43,389
GOOD LUCK.
GOOD LUCK.

00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:50,396
Ben: WE DEFINITELY THINK
THE SHARKS MISSED OUT.

00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:53,132
THEY MISSED OUT ON A COMPANY
THAT'S CHANGING THINGS,

00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:54,367
A COMPANY
THAT'S GONNA GROW,

00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:56,336
AND A COMPANY
THAT'S GOING TO BE PROFITABLE,

00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,104
UM, AND A COMPANY
THAT THEY WOULD HAVE HAD

00:13:58,104 --> 00:13:59,172
A LOT OF FUN
BEING A PART OF.

00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:08,281
Narrator: IN SEASON 5, JOHN,
SAL, AND ANTHONY MADE A DEAL

00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:11,417
WITH LORI GREINER FOR THEIR
PRODUCT, THE PAINT BRUSH COVER.

00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,319
LORI, WELCOME
TO THE FAMILY.
[ GASPS ] YAY!

00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,021
AH, CRAP. WHAT?!

00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,255
SORRY, BARBARA.
THAT IS GREAT.

00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,124
Narrator: LET'S SEE
WHAT THEY'RE UP TO NOW.

00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,063
WHEN I MADE MY DEAL, I TOLD THEM
I WORK WITH LIGHTNING SPEED.

00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:25,031
THERE IT IS.

00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,232
[ Chuckling ]
OH! LOOK AT THAT.

00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:27,400
AND I KEPT MY PROMISE.

00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,170
I GOT THEM INTO 2,000 HOME DEPOT
STORES JUST LIKE THAT.

00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,405
REMEMBER THIS THING?
UH-OH.

00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:34,974
I DO REMEMBER
THIS THING.
[ CHUCKLES ]

00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,342
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS
I SAID TO THE GUYS WAS,

00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,010
"WE'VE GOT TO CHANGE
THE PACKAGING."

00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,345
WE MADE IT A BOLDER COLOR.

00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,314
WE CHANGED THE GRAPHICS
COMPLETELY.

00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:43,383
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
THAT YOUR PACKAGING POPS,

00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:46,185
THAT PEOPLE WALK BY, THEY STOP,
AND THEY BUY IT.

00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:48,421
NOT ONLY ARE WE
IN HOME DEPOT NATIONWIDE.

00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:50,189
WE'RE EVERYWHERE
WE NEED TO BE.

00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:52,058
Caputo: LORI'S BEEN INSTRUMENTAL
IN HELPING US LAND DEALS

00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,359
WITH ALL
THE MAJOR RETAILERS,

00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,428
INCLUDING ACE HARDWARE
AND SHERWIN-WILLIAMS.

00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:57,196
John:
ALL OUR RETAILERS COMBINED,

00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:59,432
WE'RE IN OVER 14,000 STORES
NATIONWIDE.

00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:01,334
I THINK WE NEED TO GO TALK
SOME MORE BUSINESS.

00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:02,368
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,170
BEFORE "SHARK TANK,"
OUR BUSINESS HAD DONE

00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,105
$35,000 IN SALES.

00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:09,242
IN 9 MONTHS,
WE'VE DONE $1.5 MILLION,

00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,377
WITH ANOTHER $1 MILLION TO COME
IN THE NEXT THREE MONTHS.

00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:14,013
CAN I GET ANOTHER
100 PALLETS TODAY?

00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,281
All: YEAH!
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
ALL RIGHT!

00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,049
Sal: BEFORE "SHARK TANK,"
WE WERE JUST THREE GUYS

00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,284
WORKING OUT
OF JOHN'S GARAGE.

00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,419
NOW WE'RE A COMPANY.

00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,120
WE HAVE 18 EMPLOYEES.

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,990
WE HAVE OUR OWN OFFICE,
AND WE HAVE A HUGE WAREHOUSE.

00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,358
WE'RE NOT JUST
A PAINT BRUSH COVER ANYMORE.

00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:28,261
WE'VE NOW INTRODUCED OUR SECOND
PRODUCT, THE ROLLER COVER.

00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,328
IT'S QUICKLY BECOMING

00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,164
JUST AS POPULAR
AS THE PAINT BRUSH COVER.

00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:33,132
"SHARK TANK"
WAS A LIFE-CHANGING EXPERIENCE,

00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:34,333
AND WE'RE LIVING PROOF

00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,403
THAT THREE GUYS WITH A DREAM
AND AN IDEA COULD GO A LONG WAY.

00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:39,272
Together: COVER UP!

00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:51,484
Narrator:
NEXT UP IS A PRODUCT

00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:54,120
THAT COULD TURN A HOBBY
INTO A LUCRATIVE PROSPECT.

00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:04,997
HELLO, SHARKS.

00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:06,132
MY NAME IS MARK PETERSON,

00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,100
AND I'M FROM
BEAUTIFUL EUGENE, OREGON.

00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,269
MY COMPANY IS
THE GOLD RUSH NUGGET BUCKET,

00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:14,040
AND TODAY I'M SEEKING 60,000
OF YOUR HARD-EARNED DOLLARS

00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,042
IN EXCHANGE
FOR 15% OF MY COMPANY.

00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,379
GOLD -- EVERYBODY WANTS IT.
WARS HAVE BEEN FOUGHT FOR IT.

00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:23,015
IT LITERALLY MAKES OUR WORLD
GO 'ROUND.

00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:25,051
BUT BEST OF ALL,
IT'S EVERYWHERE,

00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:26,252
JUST WAITING TO BE FOUND.

00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:29,255
AND IT USED TO BE
YOU NEEDED TO SPEND HOURS

00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:32,225
WORKING WITH A GOLD PAN
AND PANNING PLAIN OL' DIRT.

00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:35,127
"TOO MUCH WORK AND NOT
ENOUGH FUN," IS WHAT I SAID.

00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:38,064
SO, SHARKS, I'VE MADE IT EASY
AND FUN FOR EVERYONE,

00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:41,033
INCLUDING KIDS, TO FIND GOLD.

00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:43,169
INTRODUCING
THE GOLD RUSH NUGGET BUCKET.

00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:46,138
NOW, THE NUGGET BUCKET IS NOT
JUST ANOTHER GOLD-PANNING KIT.

00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:49,108
THIS KIT CONCENTRATES THE GOLD
INTO THIS SMALL BOWL,

00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:52,311
WHICH THEN MAKES THE PANNING
PROCESS SUPER-EASY AND FUN.

00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:54,046
ALLOW ME TO DEMONSTRATE.

00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:58,217
SIMPLY SCOOP IN
AS MUCH DIRT...AS YOU WANT,

00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:00,119
POUR IN AS MUCH WATER
AS YOU WANT...

00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:04,423
...AND THEN LET GRAVITY
DO ALL THE WORK.

00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,125
THE LONGER YOU DO THIS,

00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,995
THE MORE GOLD WILL CONCENTRATE
IN THIS BOWL.

00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:11,097
WHEN FINISHED,
SIMPLY REMOVE THE BOWL,

00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:13,032
DUMP THE CONTENTS INTO YOUR PAN,

00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,434
AND NOW YOU'RE READY
TO PAN SUPER-CONCENTRATED DIRT.

00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:17,970
WELL, SHARKS,
WHO WANTS TO DIG INTO

00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,040
THIS WORLDWIDE OPPORTUNITY AND
STRIKE IT EXTRA-RICH WITH ME?

00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,076
WELL, HOW DID YOU COME UP
WITH THIS IDEA?

00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:26,178
I TOOK MY TWO DAUGHTERS DOWN
TO THE RIVER

00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:28,414
TO FIND SOME ROCKS
FOR THEIR ROCK POLISHER.

00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,983
SO, I BOUGHT
A FIVE-GALLON BUCKET

00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:33,352
AND A COUPLE SCREENS
AND STACKED THEM ON TOP,

00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:36,422
AND THEY PLAYED
FOR AN HOUR OR TWO,

00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,224
JUST SCOOPING IN DIRT,
POURING IN WATER.

00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,392
THEY HAD THE BEST TIME.

00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,160
SO, I KNEW
I WAS ONTO SOMETHING.

00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,262
O'Leary:
ALL THE EASY PANNING LOCATIONS

00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:46,098
WERE JUST DUG OUT
DECADES AGO.

00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,301
YOU KNOW, UM...
YOU GOT TO WALK WAY UP THE RIVER
IF YOU WANT TO FIND GOLD.

00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:50,069
[ CHUCKLES ]

00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,304
YOU CAN ACTUALLY FIND GOLD
IN THE HOME DEPOT SAND.

00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,240
DO THEY KNOW ABOUT THIS?
[ LAUGHS ]

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,308
[ CHUCKLES ]
IT DOESN'T CONTAIN ENOUGH

00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:56,442
TO PAY FOR THE BAG OF SAND,

00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,344
BUT IT CONTAINS ENOUGH
TO HAVE FUN.

00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:00,246
IS IT, LIKE,
GOLD FLAKES OR --

00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,948
YEAH, UH,
IT'S CALLED MICRON GOLD.

00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:05,117
I DO HAVE A SCREEN
THAT WILL SHOW THE GOLD RING

00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,385
THAT WILL FORM IN THE BOTTOM
OF THE THIS BOWL.

00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,087
GOLD! GOLD!

00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,223
SO, THAT GOLD THERE
IS FINE ENOUGH

00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:13,459
THAT IT WILL ACTUALLY FLOAT
ON THE SURFACE TENSION OF WATER.

00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:16,028
PART OF THE PATENTED PROCESS IS,

00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:18,130
IS THAT THE COLUMN OF WATER
COMING OUT OF THE FUNNEL

00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,033
PENETRATES THE LAYER OF SAND
IT NATURALLY CREATES

00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,436
AND THEN HITS THE BOTTOM OF
THE BOWL AND THEN SPREADS OUT.

00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:28,040
DO YOU HAVE ANY SALES?
ARE YOU SELLING THIS ANYWHERE?

00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,176

$99.95 PLUS SHIPPING
AND HANDLING.

WHAT'S YOUR PROFIT
ON IT?

00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,152
ABOUT 70% MARGIN.

00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:42,421
WELL, SO, MARK,
THIS ISN'T A TOY.

00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,123

FOR THEIR KIDS.

IN THAT BUCKET THAT'S YOURS?

THE BIGGER MARKET, FOR SURE.

HAVE YOU TALKED TO THEM?

IT'S THE ADVENTURE,
ABSOLUTELY.

IT'S ADORABLE AS A KIDS' TOY.

I THINK IT'S JUST SOMETHING
THAT COULD BE REALLY FUN.

00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:30,463

BUT BECAUSE I SEE THIS
AS A TOY,

WHAT IF KEVIN'S FACE
WAS THERE?

SO, I'M GOING TO BE OUT

00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:24,970
'CAUSE I DON'T THINK
YOU NEED ANY HELP.

00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,438
OKAY.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:31,376
C.C., IT'S ALWAYS GREAT.

00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:35,214
I LOVE WHEN I SEE SOMEBODY
WITH THE DRIVE TO GO ALL-IN.

00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:38,283
AND YOU'RE FOLLOWING
IN YOUR FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS

00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:40,085
BEING AN ENTREPRENEUR.

00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:42,387
I THINK THAT YOU'RE
ON A GREAT TRAJECTORY

00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,223
TO KEEP BUILDING IT SLOWLY,

00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:47,326
BUT IT'S JUST TOO EARLY
FOR ME.

00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:49,127
I'M OUT.

00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:57,302
SO, C.C., YOU'VE DONE
A REMARKABLE AMOUNT OF WORK

00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:59,304
IN A VERY SHORT
AMOUNT OF TIME.

00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:01,306
YOU'RE QUICK,
BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE THING

00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:04,109
THAT'S BETTER THAN QUICK,
WHICH IS WHAT MARK SAID --

00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:05,377
RELENTLESS.

00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:07,412
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $80,000.

00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,181
I JUST WANT
A LITTLE MORE EQUITY

00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:11,350
BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS
A BIT OF A LONGER-TERM PLAY.

00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:14,186
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $80,000
FOR 30%.

00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:16,321
Corcoran:
YOU DON'T NEED HIM.

00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:20,292
I'M GONNA MODIFY MY OFFER.

00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:24,329
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
THE $80,000 FOR A $10 ROYALTY.

00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:27,199
AFTER I RECOUP $320,000,

00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:29,101
WHICH IS FOUR TIMES
ON MY CAPITAL,

00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,269
THAT ROYALTY GOES AWAY.

00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:33,305
WHAT REMAINS IS
A 5% EQUITY POSITION.

00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:37,175
THE ROYALTY GOES AWAY AFTER
YOU PROVE THIS BUSINESS OUT.

00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:38,410
C.C., IT'S NOT --
I'LL HELP YOU DO IT.

00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,412
I APPRECIATE YOU --
IT -- IT'S NOT
A BAD OFFER.

00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:43,048
YEAH.
AND, YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT GONNA SLAM IT OR --

00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:44,182
OR SPEAK ILL OF IT.
THAT'S A LOT OF EQUITY.

00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:46,351
EXCEPT LET ME TELL YOU...
BUT LET ME JUST --

00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:48,987
...YOU'LL PAY AN ACCOUNTANT
$30,000 A YEAR...
BARBARA, CAN I TALK?
FOR GOODNESS' SAKES, BARBARA --

00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:50,355
...JUST TO KEEP TRACK OF THAT.
C.C., THE ONLY THING IS...

00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:52,291
$30,000 JUST TO KEEP TRACK
OF THOSE DETAILS.
...CAN YOU AFFORD --

00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,458
YEAH.
CAN YOU AFFORD TO TAKE
THAT MUCH CASH

00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,027
OUT OF THE BUSINESS
WHEN YOU'RE GROWING?

00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:56,194
LET'S SAY YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL

00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:59,064
AND YOU SELL THIS BUSINESS
ONE DAY FOR $10 MILLION,

00:29:59,064 --> 00:30:00,365
WHICH I THINK
YOU'D LIKE TO DO, RIGHT?

00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:02,100
I WOULD LOVE TO DO THAT.

00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,437
BASICALLY, YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO
HAVE TO PAY ME A FRACTION

00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:07,239
OF WHAT YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO PAY HIM.

00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:11,043
THINK ABOUT IT -- YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO GIVE UP $3 MILLION.

00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:14,112
I APPRECIATE YOUR OFFER
AND CHANGING IT,

00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,315
BUT I DO NOT WANT
TO BE GIVING AWAY MONEY

00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:17,316
AS MY BUSINESS IS GROWING.

00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:19,051
YOU ARE
GIVING AWAY MONEY.

00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:20,452
YOU'RE GIVING 30% OF IT
AWAY FOREVER.
LET HER TALK!

00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:22,020
GOOD THINKING, C.C.

00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,388
WELL, I WOULD LOVE
TO COUNTER YOUR OFFER.

00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:27,392
WOULD YOU CONSIDER 25%
FOR $80,000?

00:30:30,262 --> 00:30:33,165
NO, I'M GONNA -- I'M -- I'M --
I'M GONNA STICK AT THE 30%.

00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,366
I'M NOT -- I'M NOT --

00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:37,202
I THINK -- I --
I'LL TAKE THAT DEAL --
25% FOR $80,000.

00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:38,970
YOU'LL TAKE 25%
FOR $80,000?
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,372
YES.
YEAH.

00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:42,107
Cuban:
WELL DONE, BARB.

00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:43,442
THAT'S STRAIGHT OUT
OF MY PLAYBOOK.

00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:45,110
[ BOTH LAUGH ]
THANK YOU, BARBARA.

00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,144
WE'LL BE GOOD PARTNERS.

00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:47,179
YOU'RE WELCOME.

00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:49,014
THANKS. [ LAUGHS ]
OKAY.

00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:51,416
YES.

00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:53,318
I SHOULD HAVE
FLASHED THIS AT HER

00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:56,388
RIGHT WHEN SHE WAS LEAVING
'CAUSE SHE <i>IS</i> DEAD TO ME.

00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:57,989
[ LAUGHTER ]
OH, GOD.

00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:00,258
SO EXCITED TO START
MY PARTNERSHIP WITH BARBARA.

00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:02,294
SHE WAS THE SHARK I WAS
GUNNING FOR FROM THE BEGINNING.

00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:04,396
I KNOW SHE'S SO HANDS ON
WITH ALL OF HER DEALS,

00:31:04,396 --> 00:31:06,998
AND WE'RE GONNA TAKE BOOBYPACK
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:07,999
[ LAUGHS ]

00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:23,048
Narrator:
NEXT UP IS AN INNOVATION IN THE
GROWING DO-IT-YOURSELF MARKET.

00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:32,357
HI, I'M JESSE GENET.

00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:34,393
MY COMPANY IS LUMI.

00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:41,066
I'M HERE ASKING FOR $250,000 IN
EXCHANGE FOR 5% OF MY COMPANY.

00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:43,268
HAVE YOU EVER HAD AN IDEA
FOR A T-SHIRT?

00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:45,370
OR MAYBE YOU WANTED
TO PRINT A LOGO

00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,339
ON ANYTHING OTHER THAN PAPER.

00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:51,410
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU THAT,
WITH THE POWER OF THE SUN,

00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,045
YOU COULD PRINT BEAUTIFUL,
PERMANENT IMAGERY

00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:55,313
ON ANY NATURAL MATERIAL?

00:31:55,313 --> 00:32:00,352
LET ME SHOW YOU WHY LUMI
IS UNLIKE ANYTHING YOU'VE SEEN.

00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:04,456
SIMPLY SNAP AN IMAGE, UPLOAD IT
INTO THE FREE LUMI APP.

00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:09,194
THEN PRESS "NEGATIVE," AND IT'LL
TURN YOUR IMAGE INTO A NEGATIVE

00:32:09,194 --> 00:32:11,263
THAT YOU CAN SAVE
AND PRINT AT HOME,

00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:14,366
OR ORDER FROM US,
AND WE SHIP IT TO YOU.

00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:17,202
NOW CHOOSE SOMETHING
TO PRINT ON --

00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:20,372
MAYBE AN OLD T-SHIRT
OR A TOTE BAG.

00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:24,443
TAKE OUR SUNLIGHT-ACTIVATED
INKODYE,

00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,244
SNAP THE PACKET,

00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:29,047
AND SPREAD IT ON.

00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:33,285
NOW TAKE YOUR NEGATIVE...

00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,153
AND SECURE IT IN PLACE.

00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:37,422
JUST 10 MINUTES OUT IN THE SUN

00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:40,492
WILL TURN THIS INTO
A BEAUTIFUL, PERMANENT DESIGN.

00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:43,295
SO, LET'S SEE
HOW THIS ONE TURNS OUT.

00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:48,166
OH, WOW.

00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,235
SO, THIS IS NOW
A PERMANENT IMAGE.

00:32:50,235 --> 00:32:54,105
I JUST NEED TO TAKE THIS, THROW
IT IN THE WASH, AND I'M DONE.

00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:58,076
SO, AT LUMI, WE'RE TAKING
PHOTOGRAPHY OUT OF THE DARK ROOM

00:32:58,076 --> 00:32:59,311
AND INTO THE SUN.

00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,413
LUMI CLEARLY HAS
A BRIGHT FUTURE.

00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:03,215
WHO WANTS TO JOIN ME?

00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:07,118
I HAVE LOTS AND LOTS OF SERVICES
THAT I'VE DONE THIS WITH

00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:10,021
THAT PROVIDE CLOTHING
OF EVERY NATURE,

00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:11,323
INCLUDING OTHER TCHOTCHKES.
I MEAN --

00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:14,125
THE -- THE MASSIVE DIFFERENCE
IS THAT THIS IS D.I.Y.

00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:16,394
SO, THERE'S AN INCREDIBLE
MOVEMENT HAPPENING,

00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:19,297
AND PEOPLE HAVE AN URGE
TO CREATE THINGS AT HOME.

00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:21,299
CAN I SEE
THE ONE YOU MADE?
YES.

00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,268
DOES ANYBODY ELSE
DO THIS?
NO.

00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:26,004
SO, IS THIS PROPRIETARY TO YOU?
DO YOU HAVE A PATENT ON IT?

00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,205
YES.
THE DYE IS A TRADE SECRET.

00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:31,409
A FELLOW IN THE 1950s DEVELOPED
A FORMULA FOR SOMETHING

00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:34,012
THAT WAS VERY SIMILAR TO
ESSENTIALLY WHAT I WAS SEEKING.

00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:38,149
IT TOOK ME TWO YEARS
TO TRACK DOWN THIS GUY.

00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:40,118
WAS HE USING IT AT THAT TIME
FOR HIS OWN BUSINESS?

00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:42,020
NO. IT'S DEFUNCT.

00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:46,124
AND THEN EVENTUALLY
I CONVINCE HIM THAT IF HE HAS

00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:49,194
ANY OLD INVENTORY, THAT I COULD
TAKE IT OVER, BUT IF --

00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,396
DID YOU BUY IT OUTRIGHT,
OR DOES HE STILL GET A ROYALTY?

00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:53,198
HE HAS NOTHING.
I BOUGHT IT OUTRIGHT.

00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:54,399
HOW MUCH
DID YOU PAY FOR IT?

00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,268
[ SIGHS ]
I PAID HIM $50,000.

00:33:56,268 --> 00:33:57,369
SO, WHERE
DID YOU GET THAT?

00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,037
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?
[ CHUCKLES ]

00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,338
SO, THAT'S WHEN I TOOK
AN ANGEL INVESTMENT.

00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:04,042
HE INVESTED 180K AT 10.5%.

00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,277
YOU TALKED HIM INTO --
HE GAVE YOU $180,000?

00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:07,412
YOU HAD NO SALES?
HE'S INVESTED $180,000...

00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:08,980
YES.

00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,181
...AND HE HAS 10.5% EQUITY
OF YOUR COMPANY?

00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:11,149
CORRECT.

00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:12,484
O'Leary: OKAY, JESSE.
IN THE LAST --

00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:15,020
...TELL US WHAT YOUR SALES ARE
THIS YEAR, PLEASE.

00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,022
YES, IN THE PAST
12 CONSECUTIVE MONTHS,

00:34:17,022 --> 00:34:18,290
WE HAVE $1 MILLION IN SALES.

00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,191
GOOD FOR YOU.
WOW!

00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:22,327
O'Leary:
HOW MUCH DID YOU -- HOW MUCH
DID YOU MAKE OFF THE $1 MILLION?

00:34:22,327 --> 00:34:24,062
WE ARE NET-POSITIVE 40K,

00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,330
BUT WE HAVE BEEN RE-INVESTING
THAT WHOLE TIME.

00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:26,431
SO, YOU'RE MAKING $1 MILLION
IN SALES.

00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:28,133
WHAT ARE
YOUR COST OF GOODS?

00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:30,101
WHEN WE SELL DIRECT
ON E-COMMERCE,

00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:32,237
OUR MARGINS ARE 91% BLENDED.

00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:34,372
WHEN WE SELL
TO WHOLESALERS, 78%.

00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:36,241
WE ALSO HAVE EQUIPMENT.

00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,176
JESSE, I'M NOT CLEAR
WHAT EXACTLY YOU'RE SELLING.
OKAY.

00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:40,278
YEAH, CAN YOU -- DO YOU HAVE
SAMPLES FOR US TO SEE?

00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:41,446
YES. I DO.

00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:44,082
SO, THIS IS
OUR SHADOW PRINTING KIT.

00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,451
THIS IS
OUR SUNFOLD PRINTING KIT.

00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:48,153
Herjavec: SO, JESSE,
YOU'RE SELLING THESE KITS

00:34:48,153 --> 00:34:49,254
FOR DIFFERENT PRODUCTS.

00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,056
WE'RE SELLING THE KITS.

00:34:51,056 --> 00:34:53,224
WE ALSO SELL THE DYE
IN INDIVIDUAL BOTTLES.

00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:55,327
OKAY, SO, HOW DO I BUY THAT
FROM YOU -- JUST ONLINE?

00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:57,128
YOU CAN BUY IT ONLINE,
YOU CAN BUY IT IN MICHAELS,

00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:58,163
YOU CAN BUY IT AT JO-ANN'S.

00:34:58,163 --> 00:35:00,031
SO, OUT OF THE --
WHAT DOES IT COST?

00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:01,166
WHAT DOES
WHAT KEVIN'S HOLDING COST?
THAT IS $39.99.

00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:03,268
$39.99.
Corcoran:
AND WHAT DO YOU PAY FOR THAT?

00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:05,003
$6.49.
Herjavec: HOW MANY T-SHIRTS
CAN YOU MAKE?

00:35:05,003 --> 00:35:06,271
SO, YOU CAN DO FOUR,

00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:08,206
AND THEN YOU CAN BUY REFILLS
AND DO AS MANY AS YOU WANT.

00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:09,441
WHAT'S THE REVENUE GONNA BE
NEXT YEAR?

00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:11,343
THE REVENUE NEXT YEAR,
CONSERVATIVELY,

00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:13,278
WILL BE $2.5 MILLION.

00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:14,980
AND WHERE
DO YOU BASE THAT?

00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,147
WHY -- WHY DO YOU FEEL --
WHY SUCH A BIG JUMP?

00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:17,983
WHY DO YOU FEEL YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE THAT KIND OF GROWTH?

00:35:17,983 --> 00:35:20,385
BECAUSE
FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS, UM,

00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:23,388
I'VE DEVELOPED A TRACK RECORD
OF AT LEAST DOUBLING OUR SALES.

00:35:23,388 --> 00:35:26,224
HOW BIG DO YOU THINK
YOUR COMPANY CAN GET?

00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:28,226
LIKE, HOW MANY PEOPLE

00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:30,061
WANT TO MAKE
THEIR OWN T-SHIRT AT HOME?

00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:31,229
OH, MY GOSH, I THINK

00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:33,999
IT'S ABSOLUTELY,
ASTRONOMICALLY MASSIVE.

00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:35,467
"ABSOLUTELY,
ASTRONOMICALLY MASSIVE"?

00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,202
YES! YES! [ LAUGHS ]
OKAY, I WAS JUST --

00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:38,370
I'VE -- I'VE SEEN THAT
IN PROJECTIONS BEFORE.

00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,971
OKAY.
I JUST WANTED
TO MAKE SURE.

00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,239
I CAN BACK UP
THOSE PROJECTIONS.

00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:45,010
OUT OF THAT $28 BILLION
CRAFTING/D.I.Y. SPACE,

00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:49,247
ABOUT 18% OF THAT
INVOLVES SOME TYPE OF STAMPING,

00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:51,016
MARKING, IMPRESSION --

00:35:51,016 --> 00:35:53,084
SO, LET'S -- LET'S -- LET'S
DUMB IT DOWN AND MAKE IT EASY.

00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:54,152
YES.
AND I --
YOU'RE CHARISMATIC.

00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,353
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF ENERGY.
I LOVE ALL THAT.

00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:58,056
NOW REALITY STRIKES,
OKAY?
SURE.

00:35:58,056 --> 00:35:59,190
LET'S SAY YOU HAVE
A MILLION-DOLLAR BUSINESS,

00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,425
WHICH YOU HAVE.
YES.

00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:02,494
IF YOU WERE OPTIMIZING IT,

00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:06,231
I WOULD ASSUME YOU COULD
MAKE $150,000 PRETAX.
SURE.

00:36:06,231 --> 00:36:08,233
THAT'S $100,000
AFTER TAX.
YES.

00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:12,003
TODAY, JESSE, YOU'RE ASKING ME
TO VALUE YOU AT $5 MILLION.
YES.

00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:15,073
THAT'S 50 TIMES
YOUR FREE CASH FLOW.

00:36:15,073 --> 00:36:16,241
YOU SEE ANY PROBLEM
WITH THAT?

00:36:16,241 --> 00:36:19,244
LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU
HOW I ARRIVED AT THE VALUATION.

00:36:19,244 --> 00:36:21,346
I JUST ARRIVED AT IT.
IT'S -- IT'S RIDICULOUS.

00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:24,182
JESSE,
I-I'M JUST NOT EXCITED

00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,217
ABOUT THE DO-IT-YOURSELF
BUSINESS.
OKAY.

00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:27,419
IT'S JUST NOT A FIT
FOR ME.
OKAY.

00:36:27,419 --> 00:36:28,453
AND FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.

00:36:28,453 --> 00:36:30,188
OKAY.

00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,057
UM, I'M SURE YOU HAVE
A LOVELY BUSINESS HERE.

00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:34,025
OBVIOUSLY,
YOU'RE MAKING MONEY.

00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,360
AND I LOVE YOUR PHOTO KIT,
THE BIG SQUARE ONE...

00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,162
YES.
...'CAUSE IT'S VISUAL.
YOU GET WHAT IT IS.

00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:39,130
THE REST -- IT'S A LITTLE --
IT'S STILL CONFUSING,

00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,198
AND I'VE BEEN
LISTENING HARD.

00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,266
YES.

00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:43,068
BUT I JUST DON'T
BELIEVE IN IT ENOUGH,

00:36:43,068 --> 00:36:45,303
AND I'M A LITTLE UNCERTAIN
ABOUT THE PRODUCT, SO I'M OUT.

00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:46,438
OKAY.

00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,411
OKAY, SO, I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER.

00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:55,080
BA-BAM!

00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,282
I...I LIKE YOU.

00:36:57,282 --> 00:37:00,418
I DON'T LIKE
THE VALUATION, THOUGH.

00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:02,120
SURE.
AHA!

00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,089
I MEAN, IT'S A VERY RICH ASK --
$250,000.

00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:05,390
WELL, BEFORE YOU MAKE AN OFFER,
LORI -- WAIT.

00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,026
BEFORE YOU MAKE AN OFFER,
LET ME MAKE YOU AN OFFER,

00:37:08,026 --> 00:37:09,227
AND THEN LORI MAY DECIDE --

00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,428
HE JUST INTERRUPTED
MY OFFER!

00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:12,263
NO, BECAUSE I'M GONNA HELP YOU.
I'M GONNA HELP YOU, OKAY?

00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:14,165
YOU MADE
A VERY IMPASSIONED SPEECH.
HOW ARE YOU
GONNA HELP ME?

00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:15,467
I'M GONNA -- JUST LISTEN
TO THIS, AND THEN YOU DECIDE

00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:17,168
IF YOU WANT TO PARTICIPATE
OR COMPETE, ALL RIGHT?

00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:18,336
OKAY.
READY?

00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:29,280
O'Leary:
BEFORE YOU MAKE AN OFFER,

00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,182
JUST LISTEN TO THIS,
AND THEN YOU DECIDE

00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:33,084
IF YOU WANT TO PARTICIPATE
OR COMPETE, ALL RIGHT?

00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,185
OKAY.
READY?

00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:35,353
ALL RIGHT, TWO OFFERS --

00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:36,421
YOU GET TO CHOOSE
WHICH ONE YOU LIKE.

00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:39,290
I'LL OFFER YOU $250,000,

00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,126
AND HERE'S HOW I VALUED
YOUR COMPANY.

00:37:41,126 --> 00:37:45,163
I ASSUMED YOUR $1 MILLION
SHOULD MAKE $100,000 AFTER TAX.

00:37:45,163 --> 00:37:47,332
I WOULD PAY
FIVE TIMES THAT MULTIPLE.

00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:50,034
OKAY.
SO, IF WE DO IT
THAT WAY...

00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:51,336
MM-HMM.
...YOU'RE WORTH
$500,000.

00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:55,106
SO, MY $250,000 WOULD BUY
50% OF EQUITY.

00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,009
BUT IF YOU DON'T LIKE
THAT VALUATION,

00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:03,047
I'LL <i>LEND</i> YOU
$250,000, OKAY...
YES.

00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:04,983
...AT AN 8.5% RATE...
MM-HMM.

00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:06,351
...FOR 36 MONTHS --
3 YEARS --
MM-HMM.

00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:08,286
'CAUSE YOU CAN ACTUALLY
PAY IT BACK BY THEN

00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,155
IF YOUR FORECASTS
ARE CORRECT.
YES.

00:38:10,155 --> 00:38:12,090
AND I WANT 12.5% EQUITY
TO DO THAT.

00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,993
THAT'S A VENTURE-DEBT DEAL.
YOUR COMPANY'S IDEAL FOR THAT.

00:38:14,993 --> 00:38:16,094
YEAH.

00:38:16,094 --> 00:38:17,195
NOW, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO PARTICIPATE IN ONE OF THOSE,

00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:18,263
OR ARE YOU STUPID
AND GONNA PAY MORE THAN THAT?

00:38:18,263 --> 00:38:19,330
OHH!
OHH!

00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,032
LET ME --
FIRST LET ME EXPLAIN

00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:23,334
THAT WE'VE ALREADY PROVEN
OURSELVES VERY CREDIT-WORTHY.

00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:26,971
WE TOOK -- THE LAST ONE WE TOOK
WAS ACTUALLY A $110,000 LOAN,

00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:30,108
WITH INTEREST, AND WE PAID IT
BACK WITHIN FOUR MONTHS.

00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:32,177
THAT'S WHY I LIKE THE --
THE DEBT OFFER.

00:38:32,177 --> 00:38:33,444
BUT I DIDN'T GIVE HIM
ANY EQUITY. [ LAUGHS ]

00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:35,980
JESSE, YOU WANT A LOAN
THAT GETS CONVERTED TO EQUITY,

00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,382
OR ARE YOU LOOKING
FOR STRAIGHT EQUITY?

00:38:37,382 --> 00:38:38,449
I-I WOULD --
I'M DEFINITELY OPEN

00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:40,351
TO A LOAN THAT GETS CONVERTED.
[ LAUGHS ]

00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:43,154
I HAVE TO SAY, EVEN THOUGH
HE WAS, LIKE, <i>SO</i> RUDE,

00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,089
THERE IS SOMETHING
A LITTLE APPEALING

00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:46,324
ABOUT WHAT HE'S OFFERING,
SAD TO SAY.

00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,059
WHY NOT GO
HALF AND HALF?

00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:49,460
I'M THE ONLY SHARK
THAT'S A PHOTOGRAPHER.

00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,196
NONE OF THESE PEOPLE ARE ARTISTS
LIKE YOU AND I.

00:38:51,196 --> 00:38:54,265
I WILL DO HIS DEAL WITH HIM
IF YOU WILL TAKE THAT DEAL.

00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:56,234
I WANT TO --
LOOK, YOU GET
THE QUEEN OF QVC,

00:38:56,234 --> 00:38:58,369
AND YOU GET A STARVING ARTIST,
HOLD THE "STARVING."

00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:00,138
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:39:00,138 --> 00:39:02,040
I -- I DO REALLY APPRECIATE
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO OFFER.

00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,442
THE IDEA OF HAVING YOU BOTH ON
BOARD WOULD TRULY BE TREMENDOUS.

00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:07,078
DO YOU WANT TO SELL HALF
THE COMPANY FOR $250,000?

00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:08,112
'CAUSE YOU'RE ONLY WORTH --

00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:09,414
THAT WOULD BE COMPLETELY ABSURD.
I'M SORRY.

00:39:09,414 --> 00:39:11,049
WHAT WERE YOU
GONNA COUNTER?

00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:14,018
I WOULD SAY...2%,

00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,453
AND I WOULDN'T EVEN LOOK AT IT
AS AN EXCHANGE FOR THE LOAN.

00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:18,189
2%?
I WOULD LOOK AT IT AN EXCHANGE
FOR THE ADVISORY ROLE.

00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,091
DO IT FOR 5%
SO WE EACH GET 2.5% EACH,

00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:22,060
AND I THINK
WE WOULD DO THAT DEAL.

00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,328
AND IF YOU DO IT
AS AN EQUITY INVESTMENT,

00:39:23,328 --> 00:39:24,362
YOU HAVE A DEAL.
[ LAUGHS ]

00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,164
WELL, THAT'S
WHAT YOU CAME IN ASKING.

00:39:26,164 --> 00:39:28,333
I KNOW. [ LAUGHS ]
YOU'RE RIGHT BACK TO --
VERY CLEVER, RIGHT?

00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:30,001
YEAH, I-I MEAN,
THAT IS WHAT I ASKED FOR,

00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:31,002
AND I DO FEEL IT'S FAIR.

00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:33,304
UM, I...I FEEL LIKE
I-I APPRECIATE

00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:34,339
YOU GUYS TRYING TO MEET
IN THE MIDDLE ON THAT.

00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:36,207
JESSE,
DO YOU WATCH THE SHOW?

00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,976
I HAVE WATCHED THE SHOW.

00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:39,377
OKAY, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
ANYBODY WALK IN THERE

00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:42,313
AND, WHEN ASKED
TO NEGOTIATE A PRICE,

00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:44,082
GET A DEAL
BY NOT GIVING?

00:39:44,082 --> 00:39:48,152
I'M NOT -- I'M --
I'M NOT IN A MOOD TO NOT GIVE,

00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:49,354
I'M JUST TRYING
TO WORK OUT SOMETHING

00:39:49,354 --> 00:39:50,488
THAT I THINK
WILL WORK FOR MY COMPANY.

00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:52,457
DO YOU WANT
A STRAIGHT EQUITY DEAL?

00:39:52,457 --> 00:39:54,359
IF THERE WAS
A FAIR EQUITY DEAL THAT --

00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:56,227
IF THERE WAS
A LOAN ADDITIONAL,

00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:59,097
I WOULD DEFINITELY ADD LIKE
A 2% KICKER, A 2.5% KICKER.

00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:03,101
JESSE, I'LL GIVE YOU
$250,000 FOR 15%.

00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:06,404
I SAY NO TO THAT OFFER
BECAUSE IN 2015

00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,307
AND GOING INTO 2016,
I PLAN TO BLOW THIS UP.

00:40:09,307 --> 00:40:11,442
AND I BELIEVE THAT I CAN GO
FOR A MUCH LARGER EQUITY ROUND

00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:14,078
AT A LATER DATE.
I GET THAT, BUT --
BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A PARTNER...

00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:15,980
IT'S --
...YOU HAVE TO BE
A PARTNER, TOO.

00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,115
I UNDERSTAND.

00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:19,350
SO, WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR HERE
REALLY ISN'T THAT MUCH.

00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,352
SOMETHING -- SOMETHING --
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY --

00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:22,987
I WOULD LIKE
TO OFFER UP SOMETHING

00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:25,156
THAT I THINK COULD BE
REASONABLE, POTENTIALLY.

00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:28,026
BUT -- BUT LET'S MAKE IT --
LET'S  OFFER
SOMETHING REASONABLE.

00:40:28,026 --> 00:40:31,296
250 -- 250K AS AN EQUITY
INVESTMENT FOR THAT 5%,

00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:34,465
BUT THEN ANOTHER 100K
ON TOP OF THAT

00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:37,969
AS A REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT
FOR ANOTHER 2%, 7%.

00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:39,137
THAT'S NUTS!
FOR ANOTHER 2%?

00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:40,238
THAT'S NUTS.

00:40:40,238 --> 00:40:42,173
JESSE, I'M OUT.

00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:44,175
OKAY.

00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:45,376
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:48,079
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO
IS WALK OUT WITH A SHARK.

00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,114
TWO SHARKS ARE WAY BETTER
THAN ONE SHARK

00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,250
FOR A WHOLE BUNCH OF REASONS
I THINK YOU UNDERSTAND.

00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:55,253
SO, I THINK WHAT YOU SHOULD DO
IS TAKE THIS OFFER.

00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:59,223
LORI AND I WILL SPLIT
THE $250,000 LOAN FOR 8.5%.

00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:01,225
THAT'S WHAT I SAID
ORIGINALLY, OKAY?

00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:04,195
WE WANT 5% EQUITY --
THAT KEEPS US INTERESTED.

00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:06,197
YOU SHOULD DO THAT DEAL.

00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,168
UM [CLEARS THROAT]

00:41:10,168 --> 00:41:12,203
THAT'S -- RIGHT.

00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:14,038
AM I WILLING TO OFFER --

00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:15,406
AM I WILLING TO GIVE 5%
OF THE COMPANY

00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:19,210
FOR A $250,000 LOAN
WHEN I, IN ALL HONESTY,

00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,079
CAN PROBABLY GET A LOAN
ELSEWHERE FOR THAT AMOUNT?

00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:22,146
NOT A CHANCE.

00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,314
I DEFINITELY CAN.

00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,383
DO YOU THINK A BANK GIVES YOU
THE VALUE OF A SHARK?

00:41:25,383 --> 00:41:27,018
ARE YOU KIDDING?
I WOULDN'T GET IT --

00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:29,120
NO, I WOULDN'T GO TO A BANK
AT THIS STAGE.

00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:32,390
I [CLEARS THROAT]

00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:36,461
I WOULD SAY --
I WOULD SAY THAT, AT THIS POINT,

00:41:36,461 --> 00:41:39,097
I'M NOT GONNA GIVE UP 5%
OF THE COMPANY FOR A LOAN.

00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:41,132
I'M NOT GROVELING.

00:41:41,132 --> 00:41:42,433
I'M MR. WONDERFUL,
THE SHARK.
I UNDERSTAND.

00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:44,369
I DON'T GROVEL.
I GET WHAT I WANT, ALL RIGHT?

00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:46,437
IF I'M NOT GETTING 5%,
I'M OUT.

00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:55,446
$250,000, 7%, SAME,
8.5%, 36 MONTHS.

00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:58,116
AS A LOAN? I'M --

00:41:58,116 --> 00:42:00,251
I'M NOT GONNA TAKE A LOAN
FOR 7% EQUITY IN THE COMPANY.

00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:01,352
I'M SORRY.
I'M OUT.

00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,054
I APPRECIATE THE HELP.
JESSE,
THANK YOU.

00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:06,391
JESSE, CONGRATS.
SERIOUSLY.

00:42:06,391 --> 00:42:08,192
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU FAILED.
WAY TO STICK TO YOUR GUNS.

00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,494
YOU -- YOU ACTUALLY
CAME BACK WITH A --
DIDN'T GET A DEAL.

00:42:09,494 --> 00:42:11,129
I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS
INTO A CREDIBLE COMPANY.

00:42:11,129 --> 00:42:13,031
GOOD LUCK.

00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:15,333
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
GOOD JOB, JESSE.
SERIOUSLY.

00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:19,037
WHEW! [ EXHALES DEEPLY ]

00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:20,972
I DON'T THINK I WAS ABLE
TO GIVE UP ENOUGH OF THE COMPANY

00:42:20,972 --> 00:42:23,408
TO INTEREST THE SHARKS,
WHICH I UNDERSTAND,

00:42:23,408 --> 00:42:26,110
BUT I DIDN'T WANT
TO LEAVE THE ROOM WITH A LOAN.
