AT M.I.T. AND STANFORD.

00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,178

AT CALTECH AND STANFORD.

SO WE GOT TO STANFORD,

Barbara: MM.

00:04:52,308 --> 00:04:54,413
AND FOR ME, IT WAS
WHEN I WAS 8 YEARS OLD.

00:04:54,413 --> 00:04:57,218
I ASKED MY DAD, "CAN SANTA CLAUS
BRING ME A BARBIE THIS YEAR?"

00:04:57,218 --> 00:04:59,524
AND HE SAID "NO."
AND INSTEAD I GOT MY OWN SAW.

00:04:59,524 --> 00:05:02,163
AH!
SO I BUILT DOLLS AND DOLLHOUSES
OUT OF WOOD AND NAILS.

00:05:02,163 --> 00:05:03,398
AND I JUST --

00:05:03,398 --> 00:05:05,436
THAT JUST STARTED MY LOVE
OF ENGINEERING RIGHT THERE.

00:05:05,436 --> 00:05:08,241
DID YOU HAVE A NATURAL
INTEREST TO BUILD THINGS,

00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,279
OR DID YOUR DAD
PUSH YOU THAT WAY?

00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:12,216

WHERE ARE YOU MAKING
THOSE SALES?

00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,277
SO WE'RE IN OTHER

00:06:15,348 --> 00:06:17,419
BASICALLY, LAST YEAR WE WERE
PRIMARILY ONLINE,

00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:20,225
AND LAST YEAR WE DID
$540,000 IN SALES.

00:06:20,225 --> 00:06:21,561
ARE YOU GETTING ANY SALES
FOR BOYS, THOUGH?

00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:22,597
'CAUSE IT DOESN'T --
Both: YES.

00:06:22,597 --> 00:06:24,300
WE DO HAVE BOYS
PLAYING WITH IT, TOO.

00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,536
IS IT GENDER-SPECIFIC?

00:06:25,536 --> 00:06:27,340
ON YOUR OPENING COMMENTS,
I THOUGHT IT WAS

00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,612
A PRODUCT TARGETED
TO DEVELOPING YOUNG GIRLS.

00:06:29,612 --> 00:06:31,382
YES. WE'VE MADE IT
GENDER-SPECIFIC

00:06:31,382 --> 00:06:33,586
IN THAT YOU CAN START BY
MAKING A DOLLHOUSE.

00:06:33,586 --> 00:06:36,192
BUT BOYS HAVE COME TO US
AND BOYS ARE PLAYING WITH IT.

00:06:36,192 --> 00:06:37,561
WHAT DOES IT SELL FOR?

00:06:37,561 --> 00:06:39,498
SO WE HAVE
MULTIPLE PRODUCTS.

00:06:39,498 --> 00:06:41,302
THE ONE THAT YOU HAVE
IN FRONT OF YOU NOW,

00:06:41,302 --> 00:06:43,540
THAT'S THE STUDIO.
THAT SELLS FOR $29.99.

00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,211
WHAT DOES IT COST YOU TO MAKE?

00:06:45,211 --> 00:06:46,513
IT COSTS US $8.75 TO MAKE.

00:06:46,513 --> 00:06:48,517
WHAT DO YOU SELL IT
TO THE STORE FOR?

00:06:48,517 --> 00:06:52,458
SO WITH RETAILERS,
IT RANGES FROM $16.50 TO $24.

GOES INTO CREATING THINGS.
