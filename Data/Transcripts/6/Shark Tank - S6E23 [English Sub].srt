EVER SINCE
SHE WAS 4 YEARS OLD,

00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:03,090
WE NOTICED THAT SHE WAS
A NATURAL ENTREPRENEUR.

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,158
AH, THERE YOU GO.

00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:07,227
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER,

ANYTHING THAT WE COULD
MAKE OURSELVES,

00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:16,103
WE WOULD SELL IT.

ONE PRODUCT
WAS A TOP SELLER,

00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:20,173
AND I KNEW WE COULD MAKE THAT
A REAL BUSINESS,

00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:21,975
SO I ASKED MY PARENTS
FOR HELP,

00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,177
AND THAT'S HOW MY BUSINESS
WAS BORN.

00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:27,080

BETWEEN GOING TO SCHOOL
AND WORKING ON BUSINESS,

00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,423

SENT ME A 1940s COOKBOOK

00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,233
WITH HER FAVORITE RECIPE
OF FLAXSEED LEMONADE IN IT.

00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,168
I DIDN'T ENJOY THE BEE STINGS
AT ALL,

00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,170
BUT I BECAME FASCINATED
WITH BEES

00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,106
AND WHAT THEY DO
IN OUR ECOSYSTEM,

00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:01,274

GOTCHA.

00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,342
SO, WHEN YOU GO INTO
THE SOUTHWEST REGION...

00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:24,010
MM-HMM.

00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,046
...WOULD YOU THEN HAVE AN ORDER
FOR 2,700 BOTTLES?

00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:28,081
WE BELIEVE
BY THE SECOND QUARTER,

00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:29,349
WE WILL HAVE ENOUGH VOLUME

00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:33,386
TO GET US TO 3,000 GALLONS
PER SKU,

00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,322
AND THEN WE CAN LOWER THAT COST.

00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:38,058
GUYS, I LOOK AT THIS AS
A VERY COMPETITIVE MARKET.

00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:40,026
NOT TO SAY THAT MIKAILA
ISN'T FANTASTIC.

00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,162
THE GUTS TO COME IN HERE
AND PITCH US --

00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:43,163
THAT TAKES A LOT.

00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:45,031
BUT YOU'RE NOT COMMITTED,
MIKAILA.

00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,033
YOU'RE NOT WILLING
TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL.

00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,335
[ LAUGHS ]
SO I HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THAT.

00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:53,039
AND I WANT MY C.E.O. FULL TIME,
SO COME BACK

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,342
WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY READY
TO SAY, "SCHOOL'S OUT FOREVER,"

00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:56,343
AND WE'LL TALK.

00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:57,410
UNTIL THEN, I'M OUT.

00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:02,349
MIKAILA, WE SEE A LOT OF
DIFFERENT PRODUCTS ON THE SHOW.

00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:06,252
SOME THINGS ARE MORE COMPETITIVE
THAN OTHERS.

00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:10,123
THE DRINK MARKET LIKE THIS
AT A STORE LEVEL,

00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:12,058
IT'S VERY, VERY DIFFICULT

00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:16,029
BECAUSE IT COMES DOWN TO BRAND
AND SHELF SPACE,

00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,397
WHICH IS DIFFERENT
THAN NECESSARILY

00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:19,032
THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT.

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,105
SO, FOR ME, IT'S JUST
A REALLY TOUGH MARKET.

00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,039
I-I'M OUT.

00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,276
SO, A COUPLE OF THINGS --

00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,078
UM, YOU MENTIONED
COM-- COMMITMENT,

00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,313
AND YOU MENTIONED
SHELF SPACE.

00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:36,282
FIRST, SHE STARTED THIS
WHEN SHE WAS 4√ YEARS OLD.

00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:37,384
[ CHUCKLES ]

00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:39,219
AND SHE'S BEEN DOING IT
FOR FIVE YEARS.

00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:42,122
SO, OVER HALF HER LIFE,
SHE'S BEEN SELLING LEMONADE.

00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,090
SO I-I-I WOULD DISAGREE

00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,325
THAT, UH,
THERE'S A LACK OF COMMITMENT.

00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,327
EVEN THOUGH SHE'S NOT WILLING
TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL YET,

00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:49,062
SHE'S VERY MUCH COMMITTED.
Cuban: [ LAUGHS ]

00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:50,463
YEAH, I DON'T THINK
IT'S A QUESTION OF COMMITMENT.

00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,232
FOR FIVE YEARS.
DEFINITELY COMMITTED,

00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:53,266
AND AS FAR AS --
YOU CAN'T TAKE
HIS QUESTION SERIOUSLY.

00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:54,434
YEAH.

00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:56,202
YES, YOU CAN.
I'M DEAD SERIOUS.
AS FAR AS SHELF SPACE --

00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,237
NO. YOU CAN'T.
WE'VE ALREADY --
WE'VE ALREADY --

00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:58,238
WE'VE ALREADY GOT
THE SHELF SPACE,

00:08:58,238 --> 00:08:59,239
AND WE'VE GOT
AN OPPORTUNITY --

00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,373
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, THEO,

00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,409
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN -- MIKAILA,
YOU'RE AMAZING, RIGHT?

00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:05,278
I MEAN,
Y-YOU'RE INCREDIBLE.

00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,981
BUT THE CHALLENGE IS,
YOU'RE NOT QUITE A COMPANY YET.

00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:12,218
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY TO ME,
WHILE THIS IS A GREAT START,

00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,354
I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE BEST
THAT MIKAILA'S GOING TO DO.

00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:17,390
I JUST THINK THAT THERE'S
SO MUCH BETTER AHEAD FOR HER,

00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,159
SO COME BACK, YOU KNOW,

00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,461
WHEN YOU GRADUATE
FROM MIDDLE SCHOOL.

00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:23,363
YOU'LL PROBABLY OWN
HALF THE PLACE.

00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:25,165
UM, BUT WE WANT
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:26,332

WITH WHAT I THINK

00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:52,325
IS ONE OF THE BEST LOGOS
I'VE EVER SEEN FOR LEMONADE.

IT'S AMAZING.
THANK YOU.

00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:58,064
I HAVE STRUGGLE HERE,
BECAUSE I CAN'T DRINK LEMONADE.

00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,232
I AM ALLERGIC.

00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:03,103
SO, I COULDN'T TRY IT.

00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:06,206

00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:48,020
THAT HELPS PEOPLE IMPROVE
WHAT SHOWS UP

00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,322
WHEN SOMEONE SEARCHES FOR THEM
ONLINE.

00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:52,258
SO, IF AN EMPLOYER, A CLIENT,
A COLLEAGUE,

00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,060
OR EVEN A DATE LOOKS THEM UP,

00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,129
THEY WON'T FIND THAT
EMBARRASSING BLOG FROM COLLEGE.

00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,264
INSTEAD, THEY'LL FIND
WHAT YOU WANT THEM TO FIND --

00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,400
ACCURATE, RELEVANT RESULTS
ABOUT YOU.

00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,136
OUR ONLINE PLATFORM IS SIMPLE.

00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:04,370
YOU SIGN UP FOR AN ACCOUNT

00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,206
AND ENTER YOUR NAME
TO GET YOUR SEARCH RESULTS.

00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:09,275
YOU MARK THOSE RESULTS

00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:13,179
AS EITHER POSITIVE, IRRELEVANT,

00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:15,281
OR NEGATIVE TO GET A SCORE,

00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,116
WHICH IS BASED ON
HOW GOOD YOU CURRENTLY LOOK

00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:18,384
WHEN SOMEONE LOOKS YOU UP.

00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,286
IN THIS CASE, IT LOOKS LIKE
WE COULD USE SOME HELP.

00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,989
SO NEXT,
YOU SUBMIT THE RELEVANT THINGS

00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:24,991
YOU THINK
PEOPLE SHOULD BE FINDING.

00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:27,059
YOUR PERSONAL WEBSITE,
AN ARTICLE YOU WROTE --

00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,060
ANYTHING.

00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,263
OUR SOFTWARE ANALYZES THAT

00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,298
AND SHOWS YOU ALL THE STEPS
YOU CAN TAKE THAT YOU HAVEN'T

00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:35,034
THAT WILL MAKE IT
MORE SEARCH-ENGINE FRIENDLY

00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,270
AND THEREFORE RANK HIGHER
FOR YOUR NAME.

00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,971
NOW, YOU REPEAT THIS PROCESS

00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,240
UNTIL YOUR FIRST PAGE IS FILLED
WITH RELEVANT RESULTS,

00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,210
AND IRRELEVANT OR UNWANTED
RESULTS ARE BURIED FAR BELOW.

00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:47,113
NOW, THIS IS THE SAME PROCESS
YOU USED TO HAVE TO PAY A FIRM

00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:50,149
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS
A YEAR TO DO FOR YOU.

00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,285
BUT TODAY, EVERYBODY NEEDS
THE POWER AND THE TOOLS

00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:55,288
TO PUT THEM BACK IN CONTROL
OF THEIR OWN ONLINE REPUTATIONS,

00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:58,324
AND BrandYourself
IS THE COMPANY CREATING THOSE.

00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:01,027
SO, SHARKS,
WHO WANTS TO JOIN US?

00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:03,296
HOW DO YOU MAKE MONEY?

00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,131
WE WANTED TO START OFF
WITH A FREE PRODUCT

00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,133
SO PEOPLE WOULD COME IN
AND -- AND HELP THEMSELVES,

00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,301
AND THEN A VERY INEXPENSIVE
PREMIUM VERSION,

00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,435
WHICH IS STILL
ABOUT 100 BUCKS A YEAR.

00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,270
OUR FREE PRODUCT
WAS ALSO BRINGING IN

00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,040
PEOPLE WHO TRADITIONALLY WENT
TO OUR COMPETITORS --

00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,107
HIGH-LEVEL EXECUTIVES

00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:17,043
OR PEOPLE WITH
MORE COMPLICATED PROBLEMS --

00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:18,377
AND WE LAUNCHED
A CONCIERGE SERVICE

00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:19,445
FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED THAT.

00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,280
HOW MANY PEOPLE SIGNED UP?

00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,218
WE HAVE 300,000 FREE USERS,
OVER 5,000 SUBSCRIBERS,

00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:27,453
AND CONCIERGE, WHICH IS NEW,
WHICH IS ABOUT A YEAR OLD,

00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,355
UH, A LITTLE -- AROUND 500.

00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,457
SO, CONCIERGE GETS YOU
AN ACTIVE HUMAN BEING...

00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,426
YEP. A TEAM.
...WHO IS WORKING
WITH YOU --

00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,361
YEAH. MM-HMM.
A TEAM OF PEOPLE.

00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,363
WHAT'S THE PRICE
FOR THE CONCIERGE SERVICE?

00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,432
THE AVERAGE FIRST-YEAR CONTRACT
IS ABOUT $5,000.

00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:41,167
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?

00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:44,203
SO, SINCE MARCH OF 2012,
WE'VE DONE, UH, $2.2 MILLION

00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:45,438
WITH ANOTHER $500,000
IN BOOKED CONTRACTS.
OH.

00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:47,974
OH, WOW.
BUT THE GROWTH
IS EVEN CRAZIER.

00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:49,108
OKAY.

00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,309
SO, $400,000 OUR FIRST YEAR.

00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:52,345
100% GROWTH THE NEXT YEAR
TO $800,000.

00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:55,181
THIS YEAR, WE'VE ALREADY
SURPASSED WHAT WE DID LAST YEAR.

00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,016
WE'RE ON PACE PROBABLY
TO BREAK OVER $2 MILLION.

00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,451
WHAT DO YOU DO
ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS

00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:01,153
THAT DON'T MAKE IT
INTO GOOGLE?

00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,488
THAT'S A SEPARATE TOOL SET
WE'RE WORKING ON

00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:03,990
THAT'S, YOU KNOW,
UNDER THE UMBRELLA
OF THE BUSINESS --

00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,291
YOU DON'T HAVE THAT TODAY.

00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:08,094
UH, WE DON'T HAVE IT
LAUNCHED TODAY, NO.

00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:11,364
I CAN BUY THAT, AND I HAVE,
FOR $10,000 TO $15,000, OKAY?

00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,132
MM-HMM.

00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,433
CONCIERGE SERVICE
THAT IS WORKING THEIR WAY

00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,969
THROUGH THE ISSUES
AROUND THESE BUSINESSES.
SURE.

00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,371
AND SOMETIMES
IT DOESN'T WORK AT ALL.

00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,006
YOU'RE RIGHT
IN THE SENSE NO MATTER WHAT,

00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:21,340
THERE'S NO GUARANTEED RESULT.

00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,009
SO YOU'RE
THE LOW-COST PROVIDER

00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:24,343
IN AN INDUSTRY THAT ALREADY HAS
FOUR OR FIVE COMPETITORS.

00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:26,245
IT'S NOT JUST A PRICE.
IT'S ACTUALLY THE SERVICE.

00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,247
THERE'S A REASON WHY
THE BIG GUYS TRASH-TALK US.

00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:31,083
THEY HATE US BECAUSE WE'RE
TAKING ALL THEIR CUSTOMERS
'CAUSE WE DO IT BETTER.

00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,219
UH, WE'RE THE BEST COMPANY
IN THIS INDUSTRY.

00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,421
WE'VE GOT THE BEST PEOPLE,
THE BEST TECHNOLOGY.
YEAH, BUT, PAT,
YOU KNOW, HERE'S THE PROBLEM --

00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,189
BETTER IS NOT
A DIFFERENTIATOR.

00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:39,458
YOU MAY BE SMARTER, FASTER,
LEANER, MEANER,

00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,193
AND HAVE A BETTER MODEL,

00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,462
BUT, YOU KNOW, YOUR VALUATION
IS 15 MILLION BUCKS.

00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:45,398
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING
WRONG WITH YOUR BUSINESS.

00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,367
I DON'T THINK I WOULD PAY
A $15 MILLION VALUATION FOR IT.

00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:52,171
BUT, UM, YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT
GET A CUSTOMER OUT OF IT,

00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,372
AND I HOPE YOUR CLAIMS
ARE RIGHT.

00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,174
I HOPE YOU DO
GET A CUSTOMER OUT OF IT

00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:56,375
BECAUSE I'M TELLING YOU,

00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,277
YOU'RE PAYING TOO MUCH,
AND WE'LL DO A MUCH BETTER JOB.

00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,179
I'M OUT.

00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:05,117
SO, I THINK THIS IS VALUABLE,
IT'S MUCH NEEDED,

00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,452
BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE COME
TO WORK FOR ME,

00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:07,453
WE JUST LOOK 'EM UP.

00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:08,454
RIGHT?
YEP.

00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:11,090
THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS.
HERE'S THE BAD NEWS.

00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,259
I JUST DON'T KNOW ENOUGH
ABOUT THE SPACE

00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,028
TO RISK $2 MILLION
OF MY OWN MONEY.

00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,129
I'M OUT.

00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:19,432
WELL, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
I APPRECIATE IT.

00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,368
SO, THE VALUATION IS OBVIOUSLY

00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:24,203
PROBABLY GOING TO BE AN ISSUE,
RIGHT?

00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,205
MM-HMM.
I-I-I UNDERSTAND I'M ASKING --

00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:27,440
PATRICK, IT'S AN ISSUE.

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,008
PART OF THE REASON --

00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:30,309
JUST SO YOU GUYS
ARE ON THE SAME PAGE AS ME --

00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,945
IS WE ACTUALLY
JUST RECENTLY RAISED

00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,180
PART OF A ROUND
AT THIS VALUATION.

00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,281
SO PART OF IT IS THE FAIRNESS.

00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,049
THIS IS WHAT THE MARKET'S
PRICING AT.

00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,417
HOW MUCH DID YOU RAISE?

00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,453
WE RAISED --
WE WERE OUT RAISING $5 MILLION.

00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:43,155
WE CLOSED $3 MILLION AND WANTED
TO LEAVE THE EXTRA $2 MILLION --

00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,257
SO YOU CLOSED
$3 MILLION...
YES.

00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,259
...AT ROUGHLY
A $15 MILLION VALUATION.

00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:48,260
UH, YES.

00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,297
WELL, YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE A HUSTLER.

00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,366
I LIKE THAT.
THANK YOU.

00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:54,967
I HEAR THE ADS ALL THE TIME

00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,003
FOR WHAT WE KEEP SAYING IS
YOUR MAJOR COMPETITION.

00:18:57,003 --> 00:19:00,272
THEY ARE SPENDING MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS ON ADVERTISING.

00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,975
WHILE I THINK
IT'S A GREAT CONCEPT,

00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,443
I THINK THAT YOU ARE
GOING TO HAVE TO SPEND MILLIONS

00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:08,381
IN ADVERTISING
TO BE ABLE TO BEAT THEM.

00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:10,182
I'M OUT.

00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:12,284
I-I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE
THE FEEDBACK.

00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:16,188
OKAY, WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?
ROBERT AND MR. CUBAN.

00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:18,157
TWO TECH GUYS.

00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,092
OKAY, PATRICK,
HERE'S -- HERE'S WHAT I SEE.

00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,061
WE ALL HAVE TO SHRINK
OUR DIGITAL FOOTPRINT,

00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:25,331
BUT THE GROWTH SIDE
OF YOUR BUSINESS, I THINK,

00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,166
IS GOING TO REACH
A ROADBLOCK

00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,135
AS THE TECHNOLOGY CHANGES

00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:32,004
AND THE DEPENDENCY
ON SOCIAL MEDIA GROWS.

00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,306
YET YOU DON'T KNOW HOW YOU'RE
GOING TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM,

00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:37,076
BUT YOU'RE PRICING AS IF
YOU HAVE SOLVED THAT PROBLEM.

00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:39,412
AND BECAUSE
OF THAT DISCONNECT,

00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:40,946
I'M OUT.

00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:43,082
OKAY.
WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:44,183
THANK YOU.

00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,251
ROBERT?

00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:47,119
MR. HERJAVEC, MR. SECURITY GUY.

00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,088
PAT, I LIKE IT.

00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:50,256
YOU KNOW, I -- I THINK

00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:52,158
THAT, UH, THERE'S DEFINITELY
A BUSINESS HERE.

00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:53,225
YEP.

00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,027
I THINK THERE'S
A VERY LARGE BUSINESS

00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,297
FOR CONSUMERS THAT MAY NOT
BE COMPUTER SAVVY,

00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:01,033
THAT WANT A BETTER REPUTATION
OR GET RID OF SOMETHING.

00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,003
YOUR REAL VALUE
IS YOUR GROWTH.

00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:05,337
YEAH.

00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:07,006
BUT THE VALUATION IS NUTS.

00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:08,307
I MEAN, IT'S --

00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,409
IT'S JUST NUTS.
I HEAR -- I HEAR YOU.
WHAT -- WHAT WOULD --

00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,311
I MEAN, IT'S $15 MILLION,
$16 MILLION AT THIS POINT,

00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,246
WHERE YOU'RE DOING A COUPLE
MILLION DOLLARS IN SALES.

00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,315
BUT HERE'S THE BEAUTY
OF "SHARK TANK."

00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:19,452
YOU'RE ALLOWED TO ASK
FOR WHATEVER YOU WANT.

00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:20,453
YEP.

00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:22,154
RIGHT?
YES.

00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:25,324
AS A SHARK, I'M ALLOWED
TO OFFER WHATEVER I WANT.

00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:29,995
HERE'S AN OFFER I FEEL
VERY COMFORTABLE WITH.

00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:30,996
OKAY.

00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:34,166
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $2 MILLION
FOR 25%.

00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:36,969
$2 MILLION, 25%.

00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,237
$2 MILLION, 25%.

00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,039
WHAT IF WE DID SOMETHING --

00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:41,440
BECAUSE OUT OF FAIRNESS
TO INVESTORS --

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,175
I AM A LITTLE BIT MORE LOCKED IN

00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,344
BECAUSE OF FAIRNESS
OF WHAT WE'VE JUST CLOSED ON.

00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:46,378
LOOK, I BELIEVE IN IT.

00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:48,013
I THINK YOU'RE
A REALLY SMART GUY.

00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:50,983
I THINK YOU'RE DOING IT.
I ALSO BELIEVE IT'S RISKY.

00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:54,019
WE'LL DO $10 MILLION,
$15 MILLION BY 2015,

00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:56,021
WHERE YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET
YOUR MONEY BACK --

00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,991
PATRICK, HE JUST VALUED
YOUR BUSINESS AT $8 MILLION.

00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,327
HE'S THE LARGEST INVESTOR
THAT'S EVER WRITTEN A CHECK.
PAT, I'M NOT INTER--

00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:03,462
PAT, I AM NO --
AND HE'S A SHARK.

00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,998
I LOVE IT WHEN HE DOES
MY TALKING FOR ME.

00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,199
PAT,
I DON'T HAVE ANY INTEREST --
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU.

00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,168
CAN I --
BECAUSE CLEARLY YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:10,236
I DON'T HAVE ANY INTEREST

00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:12,004
IN GETTING MY MONEY BACK
THIS YEAR, NEXT YEAR.

00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,372

SHE WOULD OFTEN BE DEPRESSED

TO SEE HER SUFFER.

THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE
AN EXTRA TABLET OF SOME SORT,

00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:15,394

THUS DROP -- BE ABLE
TO DROP PRICE.

00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:19,464
SO RIGHT NOW, THERE'S A LITTLE
OVER 30% MARGIN.

00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:23,068
30% MARGIN, THOUGH,
I THINK IS LOW.

00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,237

50% OR HIGHER.

THEY'RE OKAY WITH 40%.

I THINK THE CONCEPT
IS A NICE CONCEPT,

00:28:32,978 --> 00:28:35,013

MORE COMFORTING

THAN TO THE DOG.

IT FALLS.

YOU LAUNCH A PRODUCT LIKE THAT,

JUST BECAUSE YOU THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA

00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:30,102

WAS AT A MAJOR AGENCY

00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:12,324

COMES FORWARD --
MM-HMM.

00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:13,425

ANY OF THIS.

00:33:15,227 --> 00:33:17,395
SO I ASK MYSELF, "IF I REALLY
WANT TO COMPETE WITH YOU,

00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:21,399
CAN I TAKE $5 MILLION,
GO HIRE ANOTHER RYAN,

00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:23,268
AND SAY, 'LISTEN, GUY,

00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:25,403
LET'S GO OUT THERE
AND KNOCK THIS OFF,

00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:27,205

TO DO IT.'"

00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:29,341
YOU'RE NOT WORTH $5 MILLION.
YOU CAN'T PROTECT ANY OF IT.

$5 MILLION.

WHAT BRAND?

YOU MIGHT -- IT MIGHT --

00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:37,215
WHY CAN'T I CALL IT
"THE MR. WONDERFUL HOME T"?

00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:39,050
WAIT, STOP, STOP.
STOP!

00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:41,419

THAT'S $5 MILLION TO RISK.

00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:43,255
RIGHT.
YOU'RE PROFITABLE.
YOU'VE REDUCED THE RISK.

00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:44,356
IT TAKES NOTHING
TO SET THIS UP!
SO YOU'RE WAY AHEAD.

00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,224

PROTECT ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

"T-SHIRT WITH A COOL LOGO."

00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:58,003

"IT'S INTERESTING."

00:33:58,003 --> 00:34:00,205
NOT IN MY WILDEST DREAMS
DID I THINK YOU'D
BE MAKING $1 MILLION.

00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:02,007

SO, WORD OF MOUTH MARKETING
HAS BEEN MASSIVE FOR US WHEN --

00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:07,979
HOW DID YOU
GET THAT STARTED?
YEAH, WHAT KIND OF
WORD OF MOUTH?

00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:10,181
IT LITERALLY STARTED WITH,
YOU KNOW, YOU SELL A FEW SHIRTS,

00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:13,051
AND THEN YOU BUY CROATIA,
AND THEN YOU PUT IT ON FACEBOOK,

00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,152
AND THEN YOUR FRIENDS --

00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:16,121
SO, BY PEOPLE SEEING IT?
SO, PEOPLE SEE IT --

00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:17,255
SO IT'S JUST
A GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT.

00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:19,124
IT HAS BEEN 100% GRASSROOTS.

00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:21,026
WE'VE USED FACEBOOK
VERY EFFECTIVELY.

00:34:21,026 --> 00:34:22,394
I KNOW, MARK, YOU MIGHT NOT --
HOW MANY LIKES
DO YOU HAVE ON FACEBOOK?

00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:24,229
WE HAVE 56,000 LIKES
ON FACEBOOK.

00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:27,032
SO, WHAT I USE THAT AUDIENCE FOR
IS NOT TO SAY,

00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:28,333
"HEY, I'VE GOT
A BIG FACEBOOK AUDIENCE!"

00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,035
RIGHT.
IT'S TO SAY,
"HERE'S A NEW PRODUCT."

00:34:30,035 --> 00:34:32,003
I CAN ADVERTISE
DIRECTLY TO THAT GROUP.

00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:33,371
RIGHT, BUT YOU
HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT.

00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:34,339
AND I WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH
DID YOU SPEND LAST YEAR

00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:35,440
ON FACEBOOK ADVERTISING?

00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,208
UH, I THINK IT WAS PROBABLY

00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:39,010
LESS THAN $5,000.
WOW.
WOW.

00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,111
WE HAVE TWO ADS RIGHT NOW...
THAT'S NOT MUCH.

00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:42,213
THAT ARE CONVERTING
FOR LESS THAN $5 AN AD.

00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:43,248
OKAY,
SO THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?

00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:44,249
BUT I-I'M STILL NOT BUYING

00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:46,084
THAT WORD OF MOUTH...

00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,986
YEAH, I'M NOT
BUYING IT, EITHER.
...AND FACEBOOK ADS ARE IT.

00:34:47,986 --> 00:34:49,387
BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED
A LOT ABOUT P.R.

00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:51,122
YOU'RE FROM AN AGENCY.
RIGHT.

00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:52,290
SO, IN ADDITION TO
THE WORD OF MOUTH,

00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,092
WE'VE BEEN VERY FORTUNATE
WITH CELEBRITIES.

00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,161
PEOPLE LIKE BRYAN CRANSTON
HAVE WORN THE PRODUCT,

00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:57,362
WHICH IS,
I MEAN, SUPER COOL, RIGHT?

00:34:57,362 --> 00:34:59,230
WELL, THAT'S HUGE.
AND HOW DO YOU
CONVERT THAT TO AN IMAGE?

00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,099
YOU JUST PUT IT
ON YOUR WEBSITE?
Shell: CORRECT.

00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,300
NOW, WE DID GET LUCKY
WITH HILARY DUFF.

00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,301
SHE WORE THE SHIRT.

00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:05,103
THEN IT LANDED IN <i>US WEEKLY.</i>

00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,105
SO WHAT WAS YOUR BUMP IN SALES
FROM THAT?

00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,040
WE TOTALED -- IT WAS MORE THAN
$200,000 IN REVENUE THAT MONTH.

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,075
OKAY.

00:35:10,075 --> 00:35:11,276
ARE YOU SELLING
ALMOST ALL ONLINE

00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:12,410
OR ARE YOU SELLING
THROUGH RETAILERS?

00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,980
WE SELL A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT
DIRECTLY VIA OUR WEBSITE.

00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,982
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU HAVE BAGS...

00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:18,216
RIGHT.
...YOU HAVE HATS.

00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:20,051
IS THAT A PILLOW?
YES.

00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:21,219
WE SELL THE HATS,
WE'VE GOT THE TOTE BAGS.

00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:24,055
HOW MUCH OF THE NON-T-SHIRT
STUFF DO YOU SELL?

00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:25,190
COLLECTIVELY LESS THAN 10%.

00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:28,093
THIS YEAR, YOU MADE $1 MILLION.
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:30,328
I NEED TO HIRE SOME PEOPLE.
FIRST OFF, ON THE 5% --

00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:32,197
THAT IS A STARTING POINT
FOR A NEGOTIATION.

00:35:32,197 --> 00:35:34,332
I KNOW YOU GUYS
JUST LOVE 5%, SO --

00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:35,467
NO, WE ACTUALLY HATE IT.

00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,035
YEAH, NO, I-I TOTALLY KNOW.

00:35:37,035 --> 00:35:38,970
UM, YOU'RE A VERY
SMART GUY.
[ CHUCKLES ]

00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,972
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN US
TAKE A DEAL FOR 5%?

00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,174
AS I SAID,
5% WAS A STARTING POINT,

00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:45,043
AND WE CAN MOVE FROM THERE
IF NEED BE.
O'Leary: [ LAUGHS ]

00:35:45,043 --> 00:35:47,112
LISTEN, RYAN, I-I-I'LL HELP
EVERYBODY OUT HERE.

00:35:47,112 --> 00:35:48,413
T-SHIRTS ARE A COMMODITY,
OKAY?

00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:50,115
THEY'RE JUST
A TOTAL COMMODITY.

00:35:50,115 --> 00:35:52,017
YOU ARE A BRILLIANT MARKETER.
I'M GONNA HAND YOU THAT.

00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:53,985
BRILLIANT.
AND AN EVEN BETTER
SALESPERSON.

00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:57,288
BUT TO ME, THERE IS NO CHANCE
IN T-SHIRT HELL

00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:59,157
THAT THIS IS WORTH
$5 MILLION,

00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,359
BECAUSE EVEN THE EXISTING
ONLINE PLAYERS,

00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,229
OF WHICH THERE ARE MANY,
CAN ACTUALLY DO THAT,

00:36:04,229 --> 00:36:05,463
AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO
TO STOP THEM.

00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:07,132
I'M NOT SAYING
YOU HAVEN'T DONE

00:36:07,132 --> 00:36:08,400
A GREAT JOB IN CREATING
DEMAND FOR THIS,

00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,268
BUT THERE'S NOTHING PROPRIETARY
ABOUT IT,

00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:12,103
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING PROTECTABLE.

00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:14,072
NO WAY IN HELL
IT'S WORTH 5 MILLION BUCKS.

00:36:14,072 --> 00:36:15,173
SIR, YOU'RE WEARING A SUIT.

00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,207
I'M SELLING T-SHIRTS.

00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:17,942
I WEAR T-SHIRTS
ALL WEEKEND LONG.

00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:19,010
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
IN A T-SHIRT.

00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,078
IT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU PLAY IN THE CIRCLE.

00:36:20,078 --> 00:36:21,179
OH!
HE JUST DISSED YOU.

00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,180
WOW, RYAN!
[ LAUGHS ]

00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,348
O'Leary:
YOU CAN SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT.

00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:24,983
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY HERE --

00:36:24,983 --> 00:36:26,351
AND, YOU KNOW,
YOU CAN BE BRAVADO

00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:28,086
AND SAY WHATEVER YOU LIKE --

00:36:28,086 --> 00:36:30,088
IS GOING TO GIVE YOU
$250,000 FOR 5%,

00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:32,323
BECAUSE I LIVE
ON THE PLANET EARTH,

00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:34,092
AND I KNOW WHAT
A T-SHIRT COMPANY'S WORTH.

00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:35,293
I'M OUT.

00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:40,331
John:
COMING IN HERE, 5% --

00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:42,167
YOU DIDN'T REALLY WANT A DEAL,
I DON'T BELIEVE.

00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:44,002
I ABSOLUTELY WANTED A DEAL,
AND AS I STATED,

00:36:44,002 --> 00:36:45,303
IT IS A STARTING POINT.

00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:46,971
THEN WHY NOT ASK
FOR A REALISTIC AMOUNT?

00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:49,207
NO, HE -- HE CAME IN AND SAID
HE'S GONNA NEGOTIATE.

00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,408
THAT'S FAIR.
I WAS VERY OPEN WITH THAT.

00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:52,143
AS OPPOSED TO SAYING
HE'S NOT GOING TO NEGOTIATE.

00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:54,145
SO, LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.
WHAT WOULD YOU GO UP?

00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:55,280
I THINK 10%, 15%

00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,415
IS SOMETHING THAT I FEEL
PRETTY COMFORTABLE WITH,

00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:59,217
AND BEYOND THAT,
I THINK IT'S JUST NEGOTIATION.

00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:03,388
OKAY, SO, I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE
THAT YOU WANT A DEAL, AND, UM...

00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:05,990
IT'S JUST MY GUT FEELING.
I'M OUT.

00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:10,128
I'M SITTING HERE
TELLING YOU GUYS

00:37:10,128 --> 00:37:12,163
I GENUINELY WOULD LOVE A DEAL.

00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:15,433
YOU KNOW, I -- LOOK,
ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE
ALL VERY AWARE OF

00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:17,402
IS WHAT WE CALL
THE GOLD DIGGERS, RIGHT?

00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:19,304
SOMEONE COMING IN
NOT REALLY LOOKING FOR A DEAL,

00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:21,005
JUST LOOKING FOR THE P.R.
ABSOLUTELY.

00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:22,207
I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE A GOLD DIGGER.

00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:24,008
I THINK YOU HAVE
REAL REASONS TO BE HERE.

00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:25,143
MY QUESTION IS
WHAT COMES NEXT?

00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:27,312
THERE'S GOT TO BE MORE TO IT
TO BE A SUSTAINABLE COMPANY.

00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:28,980
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY MORE.

00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,982
THE -- THE AMAZING THING,
AND WHAT IS BLOWING MY MIND,

00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:33,284
IS THE SUSTAINABILITY OF
THIS DESIGN IN AND OF ITSELF.

00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:36,221
SO IT'S BEEN 24 MONTHS.
THIS SHIRT CONTINUES TO SELL.

00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:38,323
HAVE YOU TRIED SELLING
IN ANY LARGE RETAILERS?

00:37:38,323 --> 00:37:39,390
WE'VE NOT GONE AFTER ANYTHING,

00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,992
AND, YOU KNOW, QUITE FRANKLY,

00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,293
JUST WITH JUST ME --

00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:43,461
DO YOU DO TRADE SHOWS
OR ANYTHING?

00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:44,996
DO A FEW TRADE SHOWS,

00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:46,164
AND THAT HELPS BRING IN
SOME NEW ACCOUNTS.

00:37:46,164 --> 00:37:47,298
John: YOU BETTER --
YOU BETTER STOP THE WHOLESALE

00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:48,967
AND DO EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'RE DOING,

00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:50,034
BECAUSE IN ABOUT TWO,
THREE YEARS,

00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:51,169
ALL THE "I LOVE NEW YORK"
COMPANIES

00:37:51,169 --> 00:37:52,237
AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE,

00:37:52,237 --> 00:37:53,304
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE THIS

00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:54,372
IN EVERY SOUVENIR SHOP
ALL OVER THE PLACE,

00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:56,174
SO YOU SHOULD JUST
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT,

00:37:56,174 --> 00:37:57,208
TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN.

00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:59,210
AND, REALLY, RYAN, I --
CONGRATULATIONS.

00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,245
I THINK YOU'VE DONE
A GREAT JOB.
YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB.

00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:01,379
TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN.

00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:02,447
THE HARD PART OF THIS IS

00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:05,049
GOING FROM A PRODUCT
TO A REAL COMPANY, RIGHT?

00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:06,451
I THINK WE'VE DEVELOPED A BRAND.

00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:08,253
YOU -- YOU HAVEN'T
DEVELOPED A BRAND.

00:38:08,253 --> 00:38:10,155
YOU'VE DEVELOPED
A VERY CONVINCING PRODUCT.

00:38:10,155 --> 00:38:12,223
BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT
AN INVESTABLE COMPANY.

00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:13,324
EVERY SINGLE GREAT PRODUCT

00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:15,260
THAT'S EVER COME OUT
IN THE CLOTHING WORLD

00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,428
HAS SEEN A POINT
WHERE IT WAS HERE...
RIGHT.

00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:19,063
AND THEN IT GOT DOWN HERE.

00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,199
THE BRILLIANT COMPANIES,
THE SUPER SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES,

00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:23,067
ARE SUCCESSFUL
BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY DO

00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:24,302
WHEN IT STARTS TO DIP,
RIGHT?

00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:27,305
I JUST DON'T SEE WHAT YOU'RE
GONNA DO WHEN THAT TIME COMES.

00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:31,075
I HAVE CUSTOMERS THAT ARE DYING
FOR OTHER COLORS.

00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:32,277
I HAVE E-MAILS DAILY.

00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:34,112
RYAN.
RYAN, THAT'S GREAT.

00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:36,047
BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT
A LONG-TERM COMPANY.

00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:38,116
AND AS AN INVESTOR,
THAT'S WHAT I NEED TO SEE,

00:38:38,116 --> 00:38:39,450
AND FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.

00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:44,122
RYAN, YOUR COMPANY'S ON FIRE.
IT'S FANTASTIC.

00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:46,191
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHY YOU'RE KILLING IT.

00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:48,359
YOUR SALES ARE REMARKABLE
FOR A T-SHIRT.

00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:50,428
BUT THERE IS A LOT AT RISK
IN THE CLOTHING BUSINESS.

00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:52,297
IT'S GONNA DIP.

00:38:52,297 --> 00:38:55,400
THE HIGHS ARE HIGH,
AND THE LOWS ARE LOW.

00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,068
SO, YOU GOT TO BUILD IN
SOME RISK.

00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:58,369
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.

00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:01,105
$250,000 FOR 35%.

00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,376
ANY THOUGHTS FROM YOU, LORI?
AND THANK YOU FOR THE OFFER.

00:39:06,978 --> 00:39:09,414
WHAT IF I GAVE YOU
$250,000 FOR 30%?

00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:13,017
I W-- SO LET'S --
LET'S HYPOTHETICALLY SAY --

00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,052
JUST DO THE MATH, RIGHT?
JUST DO THE MATH.

00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:15,119
THAT'S LESS --

00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,021
THAT'S LESS
THAN I'M MAKING THIS YEAR.

00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,290
I WOULD BE SAYING,
"HERE'S THE COMPANY.
I'M WILLING IT AWAY."

00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:22,293
I WOULD WANT TO DO A FAIR DEAL
WITH YOU GUYS, AND 30% OR 35% --

00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:23,394
RYAN, YOU CAME OUT
LOOKING FOR 5%.

00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:25,096
YOU,
BY YOUR OWN ADMISSION --
O'Leary: RYAN.

00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:26,397
Greiner: BUT YOU SAID
THAT YOU --
IT WAS A STARTING POINT --

00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:28,132
YOU DON'T WALK OUT HERE
TO BE STUPID.
O'Leary: YOU HAVE TWO OFFERS.

00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:29,133
YOU'RE SMART, RYAN.
STICK TO YOUR GUNS.
YOU HAVE TWO OFFERS.

00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:30,969
YOU GOT ONE
FOR 30% AND $250,000,

00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:32,237
AND THE OTHER 35% --

00:39:32,237 --> 00:39:35,006
DON'T TURN STUPID ON US,
RYAN.
FOCUS ON THOSE.

00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:36,374
NOW YOU FOUND OUT
THE REAL MARKET VALUE.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,409
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT
THAT'S THE REAL MARKET VALUE,

00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:40,345
AND NO INSULT TO THE OFFERS.
YOU JUST HEARD TWO OFFERS!

00:39:40,345 --> 00:39:43,181
I COULD ENTERTAIN SOMETHING
IN THE 10% RANGE,

00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:44,983
AND HAPPY TO DISCUSS THAT.

00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:46,284
IN THE 10% RANGE?
10%, 15%.

00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:47,485
I'M JUST OPENING THE DOOR.
Herjavec: RYAN. RYAN.

00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:50,288
IN THE 10% RANGE, I'M TAKING
MY MONEY AND GOING HOME.

00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:51,289
I'M OUT.

00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:56,227
RYAN, YOU HAVE AN OFFER.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,428
I'M SORRY.

00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:59,464
I CA-- I-I WOULD LOVE
TO PARTNER WITH YOU,

00:39:59,464 --> 00:40:02,033
BUT I JUST CAN'T DO THAT MUCH.
WHAT'S YOUR COUNTER?

00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:04,435
WE COULD DO 10% AND $400,000.

00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:05,436
OH.
OH, MY GOSH.
OH!

00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:07,138
OH, YOU'RE RAISING
THE MONEY, TOO.

00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:08,406
I FORBID YOU
TO DO THAT DEAL.

00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,308
IT'S A $4 MILLION VALUATION.
IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE --

00:40:10,308 --> 00:40:12,010
NO, I'M SORRY.

00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:14,045
IT'S A T-SHIRT COMPANY!
I'M OUT.

00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,016
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.
OKAY.

00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:19,450
PHEW.

00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,122
RYAN, I'LL GIVE YOU $250,000
FOR 20%.

00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:37,335
I'M OUT.

00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:39,003
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.
O'Leary: OKAY.

00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:40,071
PHEW.

00:40:41,306 --> 00:40:43,408
RYAN, I'LL GIVE YOU $250,000
FOR 20%.

00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:55,453
I'M -- I'M SORRY.
IT'S JUST --

00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,121
YOU DIDN'T WANT A DEAL THEN,
LIKE I THOUGHT.
Cuban: YEAH, HE DID.

00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,189
SEE, I DON'T AGREE
WITH THAT, RYAN.

00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:00,258
DON'T -- DON'T -- DON'T GET
BUMMED OUT ABOUT THAT.

00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:01,993
ENOUGH.
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT OFFER?

00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:03,061
I APPRECIATE THE OFFER,

00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:05,096
BUT IT'S JUST --
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT --

00:41:05,096 --> 00:41:06,364
THAT'S A MILLION DOLLARS YOU'RE
SAYING THE COMPANY'S WORTH.

00:41:06,364 --> 00:41:09,167
I'M MAKING MORE THAN THAT
THIS YEAR.

00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:11,336
JUST -- YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU REALLY ARE.

00:41:11,336 --> 00:41:12,370
YOU MADE YOUR CHOICES.
NO, HE'S NOT, MARK.

00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:14,072
YES, HE IS. HE'S RIGHT.
NO, HE'S NOT.

00:41:14,072 --> 00:41:15,974
WELL, THEN, EITHER THAT,
OR HE'S ONE HELL OF A LIAR.

00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:17,275
EITHER THAT OR HE'S A LIAR
'CAUSE HE'S GIVING YOU --

00:41:17,275 --> 00:41:18,309
John: I GAVE YOU --
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND.

00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,378
20% FOR $250,000 --

00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:22,046
THAT'S WORTH MY TIME,
AS WELL.
THAT -- THAT'S ONE TIME
HE'S STUPID.

00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:23,181
HE'S NOT HERE FOR A DEAL.

00:41:23,181 --> 00:41:24,449
YOU KNOW WHAT?
HE WOULD BE --

00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:26,284
HE WOULD BE
THE MORON OF THE CENTURY

00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:27,452
IF HE SOLD $1 MILLION
IN SALES

00:41:27,452 --> 00:41:29,053
AT A MILLION-DOLLAR
VALUATION.

00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:30,488
YOU WANT TO STEP OVER DOLLARS
TO SAVE PENNIES,

00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,023
THAT'S UP TO YOU.

00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:33,224
I'M IN THE SAME EXACT INDUSTRY
AS YOU.

00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:36,327
YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT I DON'T
DESERVE 1/5 OF THE COMPANY

00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,163
TO BUST MY BUTT
AND MAKE IT A BIGGER COMPANY?

00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:42,066
SO, I HAVE ALWAYS
BUSTED MY BUTT.

00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:44,168
I'M NOT SAYING, "DAYMOND,
COME WORK FOR ME FULL TIME."

00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,004
YOU OPEN SOME DOORS,
THROW SOME BREAD CRUMBS.

00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:47,138
I'M HAPPY TO CHASE IT.

00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:48,973
I'M NOT HERE TO OPEN DOORS
AND THROW BREAD CRUMBS.

00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:50,108
I'M HERE
TO BE A PARTNER WITH YOU.

00:41:50,108 --> 00:41:52,043
I-I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOU COMING BACK IN,

00:41:52,043 --> 00:41:53,211
BUT AT $1 MILLION,

00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:55,980
I'M GONNA MAKE MORE THAN THAT
IN THIS 12-MONTH PERIOD.

00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,148
AND I -- WELL,
LIKE MY FRIEND ALWAYS SAYS,

00:41:57,148 --> 00:41:58,149
"YOU'RE DEAD TO ME, TOO."

00:41:59,317 --> 00:42:01,986
THANK YOU. WELL, I HOPE
YOU ENJOY YOUR T-SHIRTS.
Cuban: GOOD LUCK, RYAN.

00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:03,121
CONGRATULATIONS, RYAN.
GOOD LUCK.

00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:06,391
THAT WAS WEIRD, DAYMOND.
NO, IT'S NOT.

00:42:06,391 --> 00:42:08,226
HE'S NOT THAT STUPID.
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

00:42:08,226 --> 00:42:09,460
YOU DON'T SELL
A MILLION DOLLARS IN EARNING

00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,229
IN THE CURRENT YEAR
FOR A MILLION DOLLARS.

00:42:11,229 --> 00:42:13,031
THAT MILLION DOLLARS
IS PAPER THIN -- PAPER THIN.

00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,399
BUT IT'S STILL SPENDABLE.
PAPER THIN.

00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:16,034
TOTAL COMMODITY.

00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,135
IT'S A T-SHIRT.

00:42:17,135 --> 00:42:19,237
Shell: THAT WENT MUCH DIFFERENT
THAN I THOUGHT.

00:42:19,237 --> 00:42:22,006
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE COME IN
AT HIGHER THAN 5%.

00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:24,308
MAYBE I JUST COMPLETELY
SCREWED THAT UP.

00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:25,343
I-I DON'T KNOW.
