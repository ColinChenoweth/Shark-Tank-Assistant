THEIR OWN MONEY,

AUTOMATICALLY EXTRACTS THE IMAGE

00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,284

APPROVES IT,

IT COSTS US ABOUT $35 TO MAKE,

IT TAKES FOUR WEEKS.

00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:36,243

THAT DOWN TO TWO WEEKS.

YOU'VE SOLD HOW MANY?

00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,162
2,000.
Greiner:
IN 7 MONTHS, 2,000?

00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:57,063

WHAT DID YOU MAKE
ON THAT?

YOUR GROSS MARGINS?

GROSS MARGINS -- SO, $39,000.

00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,238

YOU'VE BASICALLY TOLD ME

00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,973

$2 MILLION TODAY.

00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,441

ALL RIGHT,
$100,000 FOR 5%.

00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:10,043

YOU MAKE NO MONEY.

00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,945
YOU'VE ONLY SOLD
2,000 UNITS.
SURE.

00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:13,947
HOW DO I MAKE MONEY?

00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:16,149
RIGHT, VERY IMPORTANT. SO --
YES, IT IS.

00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,119
I'VE SEEN US SELL 2,000 OF THESE
IN JUST 7 MONTHS.

00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,253
I KNOW THIS HOLIDAY SEASON,

00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,155
WE CAN GET TO 6,000
WITHOUT A PROBLEM.

00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,456
THAT'S $450,000 OF REVENUE.

00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:26,226
AND THE NEXT YEAR,
I KNOW WE CAN SELL 28,000 UNITS,

00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:28,128
WHICH IS $2.4 MILLION
OF REVENUE.

00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:29,296
SO THAT'S HOW YOU MAKE MONEY.

00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:31,298
I THINK THAT THIS IS GONNA BE
REALLY HARD TO SCALE.

00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:33,300
I SEE US
AS BECOMING THE BUSINESS --

00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,203
THE WORLDWIDE LEADER IN
ON-DEMAND CUSTOM PLUSH ANYTHING.

00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:38,338
FOR EXAMPLE,
LET'S TALK ABOUT CORPORATE.

00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,107
CORPORATE, IN TERMS
OF MASCOTS, EMBLEMS, LOGOS.

00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,108
WE'VE JUST --

00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,343
THIS EXISTS.
GUYS DO IT ALREADY.

00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,345
YEAH, THERE'S LOTS OF
COMPANIES THAT DO THAT.

00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,347
BUT ALL OF THEM HAVE MINIMUMS.

00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,083
SO INSTEAD OF ME BUYING ONE
FOR EACH OF MY KIDS,

00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,185
YOU CAN SELL 50 TO A BRAND.

00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,988
BUT YOU HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT
HOW YOU CAN AUTOMATE THAT.

00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:56,990
YOU HAVEN'T TALKED
ABOUT DOING SOMETHING

00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,425
THAT IS SO COMPLETELY
DIFFERENTIATED

00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:01,094
THAT YOU PREEMPT OTHER PEOPLE
FROM COMPETING WITH YOU.

00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,429
IF YOU'D HAVE WALKED IN
AND TALKED ABOUT 3-D PRINTERS

00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:05,131
AND HOW YOU'RE ALL SET UP,
BING, BING, BING, BING, BING.

00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,333
BUT YOU TALKED ABOUT
NONE OF THAT.

00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:11,304
IT'S STILL "CREATE, PICTURE,
SHOW, SO...DONE."
YES. YES.

00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,440
BUT WE ARE THE GO-TO PEOPLE
TO DO THAT.

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,041
YOU'RE NOT. I'M OUT.

00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:19,145
THE PROBLEM I'M HAVING WITH IT
IS PLUSH TOYS --

00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,348
IT'S A MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR
GLOBAL BUSINESS.

00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:23,283
THE PRICE POINT'S
EXTREMELY LOW.

00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:26,253
I THINK I COULD FIND THIS
FOR $9.99, OKAY?

00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:28,455
BUT IT WOULDN'T BE YOUR CHILD'S.
I GOT IT. I GOT IT.

00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:30,323
BUT I'M NOT MAKING
ENOUGH MONEY,

00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,158
BECAUSE I CAN
NEVER SCALE IT.

00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:34,361
I MEAN, YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO ANSWER THE ONLY QUESTION

00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:36,997
THAT MATTERS ON "SHARK TANK" --
HOW DO I MAKE MONEY?

00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:38,198
EVERYTHING ELSE
DOESN'T MATTER.

00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:40,367
WHO CARES ABOUT THIS?
YOU NEED TO MAKE MONEY.

00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:42,168
SO 65% MARGIN
IS NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU?

00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,004
IT'S NOT ENOUGH.
NO, IT ISN'T ENOUGH.

00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:45,438
IT ISN'T ENOUGH AT ALL.
YOU CAN'T --
YOU CAN'T DO ENOUGH UNITS.

00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:49,042
Greiner: I THINK THIS IS
A REALLY CREATIVE IDEA.

00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:51,211
YES.
BUT THE PRACTICAL ASPECT --

00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:54,014
I DON'T SEE THIS AS SOMETHING
THAT WILL EVER BE SCALABLE.

00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:56,349
I SEE IT AS A NICE, LITTLE
BUSINESS THAT YOU CAN DO,

00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,019
BUT I DON'T THINK
IT WILL EVER BECOME BIG,

00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:01,354
AND FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.

00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:04,124
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA SOLVE
THE VOLUME ISSUE.

00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:06,026
THE PEOPLE
THAT MAKE MONEY IN PLUSH

00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,094
MAKE MILLIONS OF UNITS
AT A VERY LOW COST.

00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,463
HERE'S THE ONLY WAY IT WORKS,
IN MY VIEW.

00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,165
AND I HAVE TO -- I'M GONNA
MAKE YOU AN OFFER.

00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,434
AND IN SOME WAYS, YOU'RE
INCREDIBLY LUCKY YOU'VE MET ME.

00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,103
BUT HERE'S HOW THIS WORKS.
THERE IS NO POSSIBLE WAY.

00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,104
HE ALWAYS THINKS THAT.

00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,306
SILENCE.
I'M ABOUT TO MAKE AN OFFER.

00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:20,307
I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR ANY NOISE.

00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:33,119
O'Leary: I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER.

00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,121
AND IN SOME WAYS, YOU'RE
INCREDIBLY LUCKY YOU'VE MET ME.

00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,291
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
$100,000 FOR 50%.

00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:42,362

THERE'S SOMETHING IN YOUR FAMILY

LIKE THAT TIME COULD BE NEAR.

00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:24,030
IN 2006,
BEEKEEPERS BEGAN TO NOTICE

00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,199
HUGE LOSSES
OF THE HONEYBEE POPULATION.

00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,134
WE'RE NOT SURE WHY
HONEYBEES ARE DYING,

00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:31,037
BUT WE THINK IT'S A COMBINATION
OF PESTICIDES, HABITAT LOSS,

00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,271
STRESS, AND OTHER FACTORS.

00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:34,040
IT'S CALLED
COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER.

00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:37,110
I WANTED TO DO MY PART
TO HELP SAVE THE BEES,

00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,978
AND THAT'S WHEN MY BUSINESS
WAS BORN.

00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:41,147
AT THE TIME, I HAD A STABLE JOB
IN THE TECHNOLOGY FIELD.

00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:43,015
IT WAS TOO HARD
TO BALANCE BOTH OF THEM,

00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:44,150
SO I QUIT MY JOB IN TECHNOLOGY

00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,385
TO FOCUS ON MY BUSINESS
FULL-TIME.

00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,186
NOW WE'RE EXPECTING
OUR FIRST CHILD,

00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:48,421
AND WE'RE BARELY
MAKING ENDS MEET,

00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:50,089
BUT I KNOW THIS IS WHAT WE ARE
MEANT TO DO.

00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,125
WIT THE SHARKS' HELP, I THINK
WE CAN TURN THIS BUSINESS

00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,060
INTO SOMETHING THAT IS GOING
TO CHANGE THE WORLD.

00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,346
HEY, SHARKS.

00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:16,983
MY NAME IS MATT REED,
AND MY BUSINESS IS BEE THINKING.

00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:21,187
I'M SEEKING $400,000 IN EXCHANGE
FOR 10% OF MY BUSINESS.

00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,992
SIX YEARS AGO, A HONEYBEE
FLEW INTO MY KITCHEN.

00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:28,394
MY WIFE NOTICED AND ASKED ME
TO RESCUE THE BEE,

00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,129
SO I FED IT SOME HONEY.

00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:32,098
IT DRANK AND GAINED ENERGY.

00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,433
I TOOK IT TO THE FRONT PORCH,

00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:36,202
AND I WATCHED TRIUMPHANTLY
AS IT FLEW OFF.

00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:38,337
WELL, LATER, AS MY WIFE
WAS LEAVING FOR WORK,

00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:41,140
SHE NOTICED DOZENS OF BEES
PELTING THE SCREEN DOOR,

00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,142
TRYING TO GET IN.
THE BEE I'D RESCUED

00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,077
HAD TOLD HER FRIENDS
ABOUT THE HONEY AT OUR HOUSE.

00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,180
IT'S AT THAT MOMENT
THAT I WAS STUNG

00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,081
BY A FASCINATION FOR HONEYBEES.

00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:51,217
SO I WENT INTO MY GARAGE

00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:53,219
AND BEGAN BUILDING BEEHIVES
OF VARIOUS DESIGNS,

00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:54,287
ALL FROM WESTERN RED CEDAR,

00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,389
AND I STARTED BLOGGING
ABOUT THE PROCESS.

00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:59,091
IMMEDIATELY, PEOPLE
FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY

00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:00,393
WERE ASKING TO BUY MY HIVES,

00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:03,029
BECAUSE I WAS MAKING
ALTERNATIVE DESIGNS

00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:05,031
FROM
THE HIGHEST-QUALITY MATERIALS.

00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:06,132
I KNEW I WAS ONTO SOMETHING.

00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,100
SOON, I COULDN'T BUILD HIVES
QUICKLY ENOUGH.

00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,069
TODAY, MY COMPANY SHIPS
THOUSANDS OF HIVES

00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,304
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,172
SO, SHARKS, WHO'S READY

00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:15,308
TO CREATE SOME BUZZ
WITH BEE THINKING?

00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,376
WELL,
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?

00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:20,379
TO DATE, SINCE WE STARTED
SELLING IN MID-2009,

00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,114
IS ABOUT $1.9 MILLION.

00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,983
Herjavec: YOWZA.
WOW.

00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,418
WHAT ABOUT
THE LAST 12 MONTHS?
THE LAST 12 MONTHS --

00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:28,454
SO, THIS YEAR, 2014,
WE'VE DONE $775,000.

00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,122
AND LAST YEAR?

00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:32,058
LAST YEAR WAS ABOUT $560,000.
WOW.

00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:35,995
ARE YOU MAKING ANY MONEY OFF
YOUR $750,000, OR $775,000?

00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,397
SO, SO FAR, PROFIT THIS YEAR
IS AROUND $120,000.

00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:39,465
WHO ARE YOUR CUSTOMERS?

00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,467
IS IT SOMEONE BUYING
FOR THEIR KIDS,

00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,369
AND IT'S JUST FUN
IN THE BACKYARD?

00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:46,138
RIGHT. THE REASON PEOPLE
GET INTO THIS, MOST OF THEM,

00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:48,407
SEEMS TO BE BECAUSE THEY --
THEY WANT TO HELP SOMEHOW.

00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:51,177
MANY OF YOU PROBABLY KNOW
HONEYBEES ARE DYING,

00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,179
AND ABOUT A THIRD OF OUR FOOD
SUPPLY RELIES ON THEM.

00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,214
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
YEAH. IT'S TRUE.

00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:58,217
SO IT'S -- IT'S CRITICAL
THAT WE -- WE KEEP BEES ALIVE.

00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,452
HOW MUCH IS IT PER BOX?

00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:03,222
SO, WELL, THIS HIVE HERE
IS ABOUT $360.

00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,324
AND HOW MUCH DOES
THAT COST YOU TO MAKE?

00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:08,294
UH, THIS HIVE HERE COST US
AROUND $150 TO MAKE.

00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:10,096
AND YOU SELL IT FOR $300.

00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:12,064
AND THAT'S INCLUDING
SHIPPING AND PACKAGING.

00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:14,300
SO, I ACTUALLY HAVE
A LITTLE EXPERIENCE IN BEES.

00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,068
IN BEEKEEPING,
OF COURSE YOU DO.
LET ME EXPLAIN.

00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:19,105
WHEN I WAS YOUNG,
MY GRANDMOTHER HAD
AN APPLE ORCHARD,

00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:20,306
AND SHE ARRANGED
TO PUT BEEHIVES

00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:22,108
THROUGHOUT
THE ENTIRE APPLE ORCHARD,

00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:24,076
BECAUSE IT PROMOTES
CROSS-POLLINATION

00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:26,212
AND CREATES MORE APPLES.
THAT'S WHY YOU DO IT.

00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,981
THE PROCESS
OF TENDING FOR THEM

00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:31,417
INVOLVES EXTRACTING THE HONEY
AND PROFITING FROM IT.

00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:32,985
THERE WAS
A SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP.

00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:34,220
DO YOU HAVE TO TAKE
THE HONEY OUT,

00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,354
OR COULD YOU JUST LEAVE IT,

00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,456
AND YOU DON'T HAVE DO --
IT'S MAINTENANCE-FREE?

00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:40,159
YOU CAN TAKE TWO THIRDS
OF THE HONEY OUT, CORRECT?

00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,228
GENERALLY, YOU NEED TO LEAVE
THEM 50 TO 60 POUNDS,

00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,462
DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE.

00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:46,265
MY BEES HAVE TO PAY RENT,
SO I TAKE TWO THIRDS.
[ LAUGHS ]

00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,100
I HAVE NO DOUBT.
THEY PROBABLY LOVE YOU.

00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,235
YEAH, THEY DO.
THEY'RE VERY HAPPY.

00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,403
AMAZINGLY, I BELIEVE
THAT HE KNOWS ABOUT BEES.

00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,104
Cuban: THEY GOT A ROYALTY DEAL
ON THE HONEY.

00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,439
Herjavec:
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE

00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:56,442
BETWEEN THAT HIVE, THIS HIVE,
AND THE MIDDLE ONE?

00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,011
SO, I'LL START WITH THIS ONE.

00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:01,013
IT'S BASICALLY
OUR FLAGSHIP PRODUCT.

00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:04,250
THIS IS OUR KENYAN TOP-BAR HIVE,
OUR HORIZONTAL TOP-BAR HIVE.

00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,118
Greiner: WHAT'S IN
THE MIDDLE, THERE?

00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:08,020
SO, THIS IS A HONEYCOMB.

00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,255
SO, THE BEES BUILD ALL THIS
ON THEIR OWN.

00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,323
[ GASPS ]

00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:13,025
SO YOU DUMP IN 10,000 BEES
INTO THIS BOX,

00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,360
AND THEY'RE GONNA START
BUILDING COMB AFTER COMB.

00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,329
OH, MY GOD.
THEY'RE WAX-MAKING MACHINES.

00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:18,230
DO YOU HAVE TO DO ANYTHING
TO THAT?

00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,099
I MEAN, DOES HONEY HAVE
TO BE PROCESSED, OR...?

00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,467
SO, WITH THIS STYLE,
YOU CAN CUT THE COMB RIGHT OFF,

00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,235
AND THEN YOU COULD CUT IT
INTO SQUARES

00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:24,270
AND EAT IT LIKE A SANDWICH.

00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,138
John: WHERE DO YOU BUY
THE BEES AT?

00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:29,408
SO, YOU CAN BUY THEM FROM US,
AT OUR LOCATION.

00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:31,978
YOU'RE TELLING ME
IT'S WORTH $400,000 FOR 10%?

00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:33,179
$4 MILLION.

00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:36,382
THAT'S A $4 MILLION VALUATION
ON YOUR BUSINESS, OKAY?

00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:38,484
AND IT REALLY DOESN'T MAKE
ANY MONEY YET.

00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:43,022
SO, WE HAVE GROWTH,
AND WE'VE BEEN GROWING RAPIDLY.

00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:45,057
WE ALSO HAVE A MARKET
THAT'S GROWING.

00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:47,026
NOT REALLY.
BEEKEEPING --
IF YOU ASK ANY BEE SUPPLIER,

00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:48,260
IT IS GROWING VERY RAPIDLY.

00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,030
SO, IS THIS
YOUR FULL-TIME JOB?

00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,165
YEAH.
I-I USED TO BE IN TECHNOLOGY.

00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:55,034
I QUIT THAT JOB,
FINALLY, IN 2012.

00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:57,103
MY WIFE QUIT HER JOB
THE YEAR BEFORE THAT.

00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:58,371
DO EITHER OF YOU
DRAW A SALARY?

00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:00,106
YES, WE DO.
AND WHAT IS THAT?

00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:01,374
THIS YEAR,
IT WAS AROUND $50,000,

00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:03,075
AND THAT'S 'CAUSE

00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,310
MY WIFE'S ACTUALLY HOME PREGNANT
RIGHT NOW, NINE MONTHS PREGNANT.

00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,212
WE'VE GIVEN UP OUR NORMAL
CAREERS AND SECURITY,

00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:07,947
HEALTH INSURANCE.

00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:11,350
I WENT FROM A CUSH I.T. JOB TO
SELLING BEEHIVES FOR A LIVING.

00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,120
SO OUR WHOLE LIFE IS AT STAKE.

00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,322
AND I-I HAVE SEVEN EMPLOYEES,

00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:19,091
UH, WHO, YOU KNOW,
THEIR JOBS ARE AT STAKE.

00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,459
O'Leary: YOU'VE PROVEN
YOU HAVE A BUSINESS.

00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,261
YOU'VE PROVEN
YOU'VE GOT SALES.

00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:23,362
BUT I'M SAYING,

00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,431
WHEN IS YOUR BUSINESS
GONNA BE WORTH $4 MILLION?

00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:28,000
YOU'RE A LONG WAY FROM THERE
RIGHT NOW.

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,202
YOU KNOW,
THE THING ABOUT A BEE --

00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:33,406
IT REPRESENTS IMMORTALITY AROUND
THE WORLD IN MANY CULTURES.

00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:36,409
I WOULD HAVE TO BE IMMORTAL
TO GET MY MONEY BACK FROM YOU.

00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:40,146
THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH THIS.
I'M OUT.

00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:42,114
THANK YOU, KEVIN.

00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:44,016
Herjavec:
THEY'RE BEAUTIFULLY MADE.

00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,419
HOW MANY DO PEOPLE,
ON AVERAGE, BUY?

00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:49,255
SO, AVERAGE ORDER, WHEN YOU
FACTOR IN OUR OTHER EQUIPMENT,

00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:51,123
IS AROUND $210.

00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,425
AND HOW OFTEN DO PEOPLE
REPEAT THE ORDERS?

00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:55,294
30% OF OUR ORDERS, IN THE PAST
MONTH, HAVE BEEN REPEATS.

00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:58,197
Cuban: YOU KNOW WHAT?
MATT, I'M -- I'M IMPRESSED.

00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,100
I REALLY, REALLY AM.
I-I THINK YOU DESERVE KUDOS.

00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,170
I MEAN, PHENOMENAL JOB, TRUE
SPIRIT OF AN ENTREPRENEUR.

00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:08,074
BUT I DON'T THINK YOU CAN
TAKE WHAT YOU'VE ASKED FOR

00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:10,076
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN PROPEL
YOURSELF TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:12,311
AND, REALLY,
TAKING IN AN INVESTOR

00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:16,182
PROBABLY WILL CREATE MORE STRESS
THAN YOU ALREADY HAVE.

00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:19,085
I JUST DON'T SEE IT AS BEING
ABLE TO GROW FAST ENOUGH

00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:21,053
TO SHOW ANY RETURN
ON AN INVESTMENT.

00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,288
SO FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.

00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:25,091
THANKS, MARK.

00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:27,460
I THINK WHAT YOU'VE DONE
IS GREAT, AND YOU'RE GREAT,

00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:32,031
BUT I AM TRULY
NOT A FAN OF HONEY.

00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,368
AND SO FOR ME, I CAN'T
GET EXCITED ABOUT THIS,

00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,304
SO I'M OUT.

00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:40,372
THANK YOU.

00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:44,310
I-I REALLY LOVE THAT YOU'VE
GOT IT ALL ON THE LINE.

00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:48,948
I MEAN,
YOU QUIT A GOOD JOB,

00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:51,350
YOUR WIFE IS PREGNANT,
YOU GOT SEVEN EMPLOYEES.

00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,019
I MEAN, YOU'RE ALL IN.

00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:56,155
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO THINK

00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:58,324
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO
WITH THE $400,000.

00:20:58,324 --> 00:21:01,327
MY PROBLEM WITH SALES

00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:03,329
IS WE CAN'T MAKE THEM
FAST ENOUGH.

00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:06,332
YOU DIDN'T COME OUT HERE AND
SAY, "GEE, IF I HAD MORE MONEY

00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:09,001
AND I HAD MORE INVENTORY,
I WOULD SELL MORE."

00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:11,137
THE $400,000 ISN'T GONNA
HELP YOU TODAY.

00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:12,238
I WISH IT WOULD,

00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:13,973
'CAUSE I'D LOVE TO BE
IN BUSINESS WITH YOU.

00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:15,241
I'M OUT.

00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:16,375
THANK YOU.

00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,177
I THINK THERE'S ONLY
ONE SHARK LEFT.

00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:19,245
I DIDN'T KNOW
I WAS THE LAST ONE.

00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:20,379
I THINK YOU ARE.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,248
I WAS FASCINATED BY THIS.
WELL, UH...

00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:26,418
...YOU'RE GONNA DO $1 MILLION,
LET'S SAY, THIS YEAR,

00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:28,187
AND LET'S SAY
YOU DOUBLE NEXT YEAR.

00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:32,158
IF I GAVE YOU $400,000
FOR 10%,

00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:35,060
THAT MEANS YOU WOULD MAKE IT
UP TO $4 MILLION,

00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:39,198
AND I WOULD GET $40,000,
MAYBE, IN 2 YEARS, 3 YEARS.

00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:41,133
IT WOULD TAKE
QUITE SOME TIME

00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,268
TO SCALE UP
TO GET MY MONEY BACK.

00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:44,436
IT JUST DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
THE NUMBERS WORK OUT FOR ME.

00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:47,439
SO I AM ABSOLUTELY
A CUSTOMER...

00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,975
ALL RIGHT.
...'CAUSE I LOVE
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,178
BUT I AM NOT AN INVESTOR.
I'M OUT.

00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:54,246
THANK YOU.

00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:55,347
CONGRATS, MATT.
GOOD LUCK.
THANK YOU.

00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:56,282
GOOD LUCK.

00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:03,155
THIS BUSINESS IS EVERYTHING
TO MY FAMILY, TO ME.

00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,191
I'VE GIVEN UP EVERYTHING
TO MAKE IT WORK.

00:22:05,191 --> 00:22:08,027
WE'RE GOING TO KEEP GROWING,
WITH OR WITHOUT THIS.

00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:09,361
AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO SUCCEED.

00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:21,040
Narrator: NEXT UP IS A BETTER
WAY TO SOOTHE AND TEACH BABIES.

00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:33,485
HELLO.

00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:35,387
MY NAME IS JULIE THOMPSON,
AND I'M FROM ATLANTA, GEORGIA.

00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:39,091
I AM SEEKING $100,000
FOR 20% EQUITY.

00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:42,461
PARENTS LOVE PACIFIERS
BECAUSE THEY SOOTHE THEIR BABY.

00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:46,098
BUT THEY CONSTANTLY FALL
OUT OF THEIR MOUTHS.

00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:48,067
I REMEMBER WHEN MY KIDS
WERE BABIES

00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:50,169
AND THEIR PACIFIERS
WERE CONTINUALLY POPPING OUT,

00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:51,971
AND, OF COURSE, THEY WOULD CRY,

00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:54,139
BECAUSE THEY STILL WANTED THEM,
IMMEDIATELY.

00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:57,142
OFTEN, IT WAS JUST
BEHIND HIS SHOULDER.

00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:59,378
BUT BABIES DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT THEY CAN'T SEE.

00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:03,415
THAT IS WHAT INSPIRED ME
TO CREATE THE PullyPalz.

00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:07,019
PullyPalz HANG ABOVE THE BABY

00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:09,121
AND USE SOMETHING SIMILAR
TO A PULLEY SYSTEM.

00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:12,024
WHEN ONE PACIFIER DROPS
AND FALLS OUT OF SIGHT,

00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:13,459
ANOTHER IS IN VIEW AND IN REACH.

00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:17,062
THIS INTERACTION
ENABLES INDEPENDENCE,

00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:21,066
WHICH IS GREAT FOR THOSE TIMES
WHEN PARENTS NEED AN EXTRA HAND.

00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,068
PullyPalz ARE ALSO
VERY ENTERTAINING

00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,971
AND PACKED
WITH DEVELOPMENTAL BENEFITS.

00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:27,973
PARENTS ARE RAVING
ABOUT MY PRODUCT,

00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:30,142
CREATING A DEMAND
THAT I CAN'T KEEP UP WITH.

00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:31,410
I COULD REALLY USE SOME HELP.

00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:35,080
SO BE A PAL
AND INVEST IN PullyPalz.

00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:38,050
THANK YOU, AND I WOULD LIKE
TO PASS OUT SAMPLES.

00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,318
Greiner:
WE'D LOVE TO SEE THEM.
Herjavec: THANK YOU.

00:23:39,318 --> 00:23:42,221
OKAY, ROBERT, THAT IS PUDDLES.

00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:44,290
OH, THANK YOU, JULIE.
PUDDLES.

00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,992
THIS IS MoMo.
THANK YOU.

00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:48,193
HERE IS ANOTHER PUDDLES.

00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:49,395
AND MooMoo.

00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:51,196
MooMoo.
APPRECIATE IT.
THERE YOU GO.

00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:54,133
Herjavec: JULIE, I REMEMBER
WHEN MY KIDS WERE SMALL --

00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:55,334
I'M WITH YOU, HUGE PROBLEM.

00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:57,269
PACIFIER FELL OUT
ALL THE TIME.

00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,072
BUT THEN I BOUGHT A CLIP,
AND THAT SOLVED THE PROBLEM.

00:24:00,072 --> 00:24:02,174
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THAT AND A CLIP?

00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:04,209
THE CLIP HELPED ME KEEP UP
WITH THE PACIFIER,

00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:06,211
AND AT LEAST IT DIDN'T FALL
ON THE FLOOR,

00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:08,080
BUT IT DOESN'T HELP THE BABY,
'CAUSE THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND

00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,148
ONCE IT'S OUT OF THEIR LINE
OF SIGHT.

00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:11,150
HOW MUCH
DO YOU HAVE IN SALES?

00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,186
[ Sighing ] I HAVE --
THE LAST 12 MONTHS, $97,000.

00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:15,421
WHICH ISN'T SO BAD
FOR, YOU KNOW...

00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:17,056
NO, IT'S NOT SO BAD.
RIGHT.

00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:19,325
WHERE ARE THESE SOLD
RIGHT NOW?

00:24:19,325 --> 00:24:21,327
THEY'RE SOLD ON AMAZON,

00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:24,396
AS WELL AS ABOUT 350 STORES
ACROSS THE U.S.

00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:25,431
WHICH STORES?

00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:27,433
UM, SPECIALTY, BOUTIQUES.

00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:29,368
SO, WHAT DOES THIS COST?

00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:33,105
THE RETAIL,
$19.99 UP TO $24.99.

00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:34,406
AND WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE ONE?

00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:36,041
$4.50.

00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:38,043
WHERE ARE YOU DERIVING
MOST OF YOUR SALES FROM?

00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:39,211
UH, TRADE SHOWS.

00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:42,181
YOU MENTIONED
DEVELOPMENTAL BENEFITS.

00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:44,183
YES. RIGHT-BRAIN,
LEFT-BRAIN COORDINATION.

00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:45,417
HOW DOES IT HELP
WITH THAT?

00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:48,053
BETWEEN YOUR RIGHT BRAIN
AND LEFT BRAIN, IT'S IMPORTANT

00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:51,056
FOR THE TWO OF THOSE TO KIND OF
CROSS OVER BETWEEN ONE ANOTHER.

00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:53,359
LIKE, THEY -- WHEN THEY'RE
YOUNG, THEY WILL ASK YOU,

00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:56,261
"DOES YOUR BABY GRAB SOMETHING
AND PASS IT TO THE OTHER HAND?"

00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:58,163
SO BECAUSE
YOU HAVE BOTH SIDES,

00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,299
THE BABY'S FORCED
TO GRAB AT BOTH.
RIGHT.

00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:03,235
SO, THERE IS ONE MORE THING
THAT'S REALLY GREAT ABOUT THIS.

00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:05,237
WE RECENTLY DEVELOPED --

00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:07,406
YOU CAN SEE ON THAT TREE
RIGHT THERE -- TEETHERS.

00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:11,210
THEY POP INTO THE HOLDERS, AS
WELL, SO YOU CAN CHANGE IT UP.

00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,978
IT GIVES IT MORE VERSATILITY.

00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:15,414
YOU CAN PUT A PACIFIER ON ONE
SIDE, TEETHER ON THE OTHER.

00:25:15,414 --> 00:25:17,016
PACIFIER ON BOTH.

00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:20,352
AS WELL AS,
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT TREE,

00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,254
THEY'RE CALLED THE MINIZ.

00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:23,322
THESE ARE ADORABLE.

00:25:23,322 --> 00:25:25,224
THEY'RE LITTLE MINI VERSIONS
OF THE BIG GUYS,

00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:27,459
AND THEY ALL COME
WITH A COUNTERPART.

00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:30,229
SO, LIKE, THE MONKEY
IS GONNA COME WITH A BANANA

00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:31,463
THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY PEEL.

00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:33,465
AND IT FITS INTO
THE LITTLE PULLEY SYSTEM?

00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:36,101
AND THEY ALL --
EVERYTHING IS DESIGNED TO FIT.

00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:37,336
O'Leary:
WHAT IS THE OUTLYING AGE

00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:40,139
THAT A CHILD WOULD
STILL USE A PACIFIER?

00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:43,075
I SEE 3-YEAR-OLDS WITH THEM.
YOU KNOW, I --

00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:44,977
OKAY, LET'S MAKE IT
24 MONTHS, RIGHT?

00:25:44,977 --> 00:25:45,978
YES.
TWO YEARS.

00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:47,079
THAT'S PROBABLY
THE OUTSTRETCH.

00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:50,449
SO, WHAT PERCENTAGE OF
THE POPULATION IS 24 MONTHS,

00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:52,418
BETWEEN 0 AND 24 MONTHS,
AT ANY ONE TIME?

00:25:52,418 --> 00:25:56,255
WELL, OVER 4 MILLION BABIES
ARE BORN IN THE U.S. EVERY YEAR.

00:25:56,255 --> 00:25:59,425
OKAY, SO WE SHOULD SAY
THAT 8 MILLION CANDIDATES

00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:01,994
ARE WITHIN OUR TARGET,
RIGHT?

00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:05,030
SO WE'VE GOT 8 MILLION
CUSTOMERS A YEAR,

00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,399
AND PRETTY WELL EVERY ONE
OF THEM'S GETTING ONE,

00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,234
AND YET OUR SHARE,
ON A DOLLAR BASIS,

00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,136
FROM WHAT YOU TOLD ME,
IS REALLY SMALL.

00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:13,372
ARE YOU CONCERNED
WITH THE PRICE POINT

00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:14,373
BEING TOO HIGH?

00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:16,408
BECAUSE YOU CAN BUY
A PACIFIER

00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,978
AND AN ATTACHING, YOU KNOW,
ELASTIC CORD THING...

00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:22,314
RIGHT.
...FOR,
I DON'T KNOW, 4 BUCKS.

00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:25,217
SURE, BUT THOSE DON'T -- YOU
KNOW, THEY'RE NOT INTERACTIVE.

00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:27,453
IT'S NOT -- THIS IS NOT
JUST A PACIFIER HOLDER.
JUST -- IT'S COMP--
I'M JUST ASKING,

00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:29,455
IS IT DISTRIBUTION
THAT'S THE PROBLEM?

00:26:29,455 --> 00:26:31,390
IS IT THE PRICE POINT
THAT'S THE PROBLEM?

00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,425
WHAT'S HOLDING YOU BACK?
WHAT IS HOLDING YOU BACK?

00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,295
I'M A ONE-PERSON COMPANY.

00:26:36,295 --> 00:26:38,330
I'M EVERYTHING. I'M --
Greiner: SO YOU DO IT ALL?

00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,065
I DO IT ALL.
YOU DO THE SALES.

00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:41,433
I'VE DESIGNED EVERY ONE
OF THESE GUYS,

00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,103
DOWN TO EVERY PANTONE COLOR
AND EVERY BELLY.

00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:46,305
MY SENSE OF WHAT'S HOLDING
THIS WHOLE THING BACK

00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:49,174
IS THE PRICE
AND DISTRIBUTION.

00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:55,147
NOT MANY PARENTS WOULD
SPEND $20 FOR A PACIFIER.

00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:57,049
THAT'S MY OPINION.

00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:58,317
THIS ISN'T A PACIFIER.

00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:00,419
YES.
JULIE, WHEN YOU PUT THIS
ALL TOGETHER,

00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:02,488
HOW MUCH MONEY
DID YOU INVEST?

00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:06,158
I'VE INVESTED ABOUT $175,000.

00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:07,259
$175,000?
Herjavec: WOW.

00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:09,428
WOW. WHERE DID MOST
OF THAT MONEY GO TO?

00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:11,997
OH, LET'S SEE. SAFETY TESTING
IS VERY EXPENSIVE.

00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:15,434
RIGHT.
ALSO, I HAVE $100,000
IN INVENTORY RIGHT NOW.

00:27:15,434 --> 00:27:18,303
OH.
OKAY, SO, THAT'S INTERESTING,
RIGHT THERE, RIGHT?

00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,239
SOUNDS LIKE YOU INVESTED
A LOT OF MONEY

00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:22,941
TO GET THE PRICE BREAKS
DOWN TO $4.50.
YES, I DID.

00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:25,277
John: WHERE'D YOU GET
THE $175,000 TO INVEST?

00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:27,112
UH, RETIREMENT, COLLEGE FUNDS,

00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:29,214
MY PARENTS' RETIREMENT,
CREDIT CARDS.

00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:30,382
IT'S -- IT'S SCARY.
YOU'RE ALL IN, HUH?

00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:32,284
I AM ALL IN.
WOW.

00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:35,154
JULIE, I -- I GUESS
I CAN'T GET MY MIND

00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,256
OVER THAT CLIP PRODUCT.
OKAY.

00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:38,390
AND IT WAS
VERY INEXPENSIVE,

00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,192
SO I HAVE A BIT
OF A CHALLENGE WITH THAT.

00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:43,028
AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE

00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:46,165
FLYING OFF THE SHELVES
AT THIS POINT.

00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:49,268
I'M OUT.

00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:51,436
I THINK, IN THIS CASE,
INVENTORY ISN'T A GOOD THING.

00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,438
YES.
YOU'RE JUST NOW
GETTING IT OUT THERE.

00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:56,241
AND TO ME, THAT MEANS
YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO UPDATE IT

00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:57,376
AND GO THROUGH REVISIONS.

00:27:57,376 --> 00:27:59,178
BUT YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE

00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,413
TO COME OUT WITH IT
ON A TIMELY BASIS

00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:04,283
BECAUSE YOU HAVE SO MUCH
INVENTORY YOU HAVE TO PROTECT.

00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:05,417
YOU KNOW, THAT'S A PROBLEM.

00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,019
I -- LIKE I SAID,

00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,487
I JUST DON'T SEE THE
SELL-THROUGH FAST ENOUGH,

00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:10,155
AND FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.

00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:17,162
IT'S A COMBINATION OF TWO
SECTORS IN THE TOY BUSINESS --

00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:20,199
PLUSH TOYS AND PACIFIER.

00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:24,236
PLUSH TOYS --
97% ARE SOLD AT UNDER $10.

00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:28,173
PACIFIERS,
AS CHEAP AS A DOLLAR.

00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:29,441
SO, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
YOU'VE GOT

00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:33,212
THIS INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE
DERIVATIVE OF THE TWO OF THEM,

00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:35,380
AND I THINK WHAT'S HOLDING YOU
BACK, JULIE, IS THE PRICE.

00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,282
IF THIS WAS $9.95,

00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:40,052
MY BET IS YOU WOULD SELL
FOUR TIMES MORE,

00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:42,254
AND YOU CAN'T GET YOUR
MANUFACTURING COSTS

00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:43,455
DOWN LOW ENOUGH TO DO IT.

00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:46,058
I CAN'T GET EXCITED ABOUT GOING
DOWN THAT ROAD WITH YOU.

00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:47,159
I'M OUT.

00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:52,464
John: MY CONCERN IS THAT
THE HANGING APPEAL

00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,433
MAY NOT BE
SELF-EXPLANATORY.

00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:57,970
I HAVE DEVELOPED TREES,
SMALLER TREES,

00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,138
BECAUSE MANY OF MY RETAILERS
WANTED THEM, AND I'VE HAD TO --

00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:01,974
O'Leary: THAT'S EXPENSIVE
TO PUT IN RETAIL.
Greiner: DO THEY PUT IT IN?

00:29:01,974 --> 00:29:03,308
DO THEY PUT A TREE IN?
THEY DO.
MY -- THE RETAILERS

00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:05,110
THAT CARRY THIS PRODUCT LOVE IT
AND ARE EXCITED.

00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,311
THEY PUT THAT IN
BECAUSE YOU'RE DEALING

00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:09,047
WITH, GENERALLY,
SPECIALTY STORES.

00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:10,415
BUT IF YOU GO TO A BABIES "R" US
OR BUY BUY BABY,

00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,084
YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE
THAT ABILITY

00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,385
WITHOUT THEM CHARGING YOU.

00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:14,419

OF MY DECIDING FACTORS...

...THE FACT THAT I THINK
THAT HANGER APPEAL

00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:19,391
IS NOT REALLY THERE,

YOU'D BETTER TAKE THAT.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

WOULD YOU CONSIDER 25%?

FOR 5%?

YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH LIGHT

UNBREAKABLE STABILITY BAR

IS MEMORY FOAM.

OF THE INSERT,

I'M FROM COTE D'IVOIRE,
WEST AFRICA,

AND I WAS THERE WHEN THE WAR
BROKE OUT IN MY COUNTRY.

00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:03,381
I LITERALLY HAD TO RUN
TO COME HERE.

00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:05,450
THAT WAS AFTER I HAD MY FATHER
IN MY ARMS,

00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,252
LITERALLY, WHEN HE DIED.
MM.

00:33:07,252 --> 00:33:09,354

AS A TRACK-AND-FIELD --

00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:10,655
ON A TRACK-AND-FIELD
SCHOLARSHIP.

00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,390

WHEN I RAN TRACK,
EVERY SINGLE TIME WE RAN,

00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:18,230

HAD A REALLY THIN INSERT.

00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,199
TWO WEEKS, THE SHOE INSERTS
WERE WORN OUT.

I WENT TO CHINA
WITH MY LAW SCHOOL,

00:33:23,602 --> 00:33:26,538

TO MEET ALL THE RIGHT PEOPLE.

IT IS.

00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:06,311
HERE'S MY QUESTION.
SO WHAT?

00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:11,383
THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT
SHOES ON THE MARKET.

00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,218
THERE ARE SOME PLAYERS

00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:14,586
THAT OWN THIS
MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR MARKET.

00:34:14,586 --> 00:34:15,687

00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:20,292
WHY WOULD FORUS EVER HAVE
A CHANCE OF GAINING SHARE

00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:21,526
AGAINST THEM
TO BE A BIG COMPANY?

00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:22,661
EXPLAIN HOW THAT COULD HAPPEN.

00:34:22,661 --> 00:34:25,330
HOW ABOUT HALF A MILLION DOLLARS
IN 12 MONTHS?

00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,532
IT'S ACTUALLY SIX --
SIX MONTHS.

00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:30,335
HALF A MILLION DOLLARS IN SALES
IN SIX MONTHS?

00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:31,269
CORRECT.

00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:33,605
OKAY, THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.

00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:34,673
I THINK
YOU'VE CONVINCED EVERYBODY

00:34:34,673 --> 00:34:36,308
YOU'VE DESIGNED A DECENT SHOE.

00:34:36,308 --> 00:34:39,244
WHAT'S THE PLAN TO INCREASE
SALES BY FOUR TIMES?

00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:41,179
YOU'RE ONLY $500,000 RIGHT NOW.

00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,280
WELL, THAT'S WHY
WE'RE HERE, ACTUALLY.

00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,516
NEXT YEAR, WE'VE PROJECTED
ABOUT $2.5 MILLION.

00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:46,318
HOW ARE YOU GONNA GET THERE?

00:34:46,318 --> 00:34:48,286
THAT'S BASED ON THE CURRENT
ARSENAL WE HAVE.

00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:50,322
THE ONLY REASON WE DIDN'T GET
THOSE SALES LAST YEAR

00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:52,290
WAS BECAUSE WE MISSED
THE WINDOW OF THE SEASON.

00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:57,262
Greiner: YOU KNOW WHAT? TO ME,
THERE'S THESE MAJOR PLAYERS,

00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:59,564
LIKE SAUCONY AND NIKE
AND ADIDAS.

00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:04,402
I'M NOT SURE HOW YOU WOULD
ACTUALLY PENETRATE THAT

00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:07,539
SO STRONGLY THAT I WOULD GET
BACK MY MONEY.

00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:10,175
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.

00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:12,644
I WANT TO SAY ONE THING.

00:35:12,644 --> 00:35:15,447

OR ARE YOU CREATING
A RUNNING SHOE?

00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:26,358
ARE YOU ABOUT FASHION,
OR ARE YOU ABOUT FUNCTIONALITY?

00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:27,359
BOTH.
BOTH.

00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,427
WE'RE CREATING
A LIFESTYLE SHOE

00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:30,595
THAT EMBODIES
THE SPIRIT OF NASCAR.

00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:32,564
THAT -- YOU'RE CREATING
A LOT OF BATTLES

00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:34,466
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE MONEY
TO MARKET TO.

00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:35,667
HOW MUCH INVENTORY DO YOU HAVE?

00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,602
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE
ABOUT $65,000 -- $68,000.

00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:40,472
HOW MANY OF THE RUNNERS' STORES
YOU SOLD TO --

00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:43,341
HOW MANY OF THEM REORDER?

00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:44,643
ALL OF THEM.
THAT'S OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM.

00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,311
THEY ALL REORDER?
YES.

00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:47,612
WE DON'T HAVE THEM.
WE CAN'T KEEP THEM IN STOCK.

00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:52,550
THE CHALLENGE WITH THIS SPACE --
YOU'VE GOT TO GET DISTRIBUTION,

00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,586
AND THAT'S WHERE I THINK
YOU HIT THE BRICK WALL,

00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:57,555
BECAUSE TAKING A VERY FAMOUS
BRAND OFF THE WALL

00:35:57,555 --> 00:36:01,292
TO PUT THIS THERE, INSTEAD,
THAT AIN'T FREE.

00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:04,429
YOUR CHALLENGES
ARE NOT BEHIND YOU.

00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:05,563
THEY'RE AHEAD OF YOU.

00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:07,632
I'M NOT GONNA GO ON THAT JOURNEY
WITH YOU. I'M OUT.

00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:13,505
LOOK, I CAN JUST SEE --
THIS OWNS YOU, RIGHT?

00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:16,441
I-IT'S NOT -- IT'S NOT
A BUSINESS. IT'S YOU.

00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:18,209
THE REALITY FOR ME IS

00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:21,212
THE MAVS HAVE GOT A HUGE DEAL
WITH ADIDAS.

00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:23,381
I'VE GOT A BIG DEAL
WITH SKECHERS.

00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:25,450
I'M A LOYAL GUY TO THE BRANDS
I'M WORKING WITH,

00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:26,584
WHO HAVE BEEN LOYAL TO ME.

00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:29,254
I JUST CAN'T FIGURE OUT
HOW TO MAKE IT WORK,

00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:30,555
AND FOR THOSE REASONS, I'M OUT.

00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:32,357
BUT I REALLY WANT YOU GUYS
TO SUCCEED.

00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:33,458
THANK YOU.

00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:35,593
SO, I'M GONNA TOUCH
ON SOME OF THE THINGS

00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:37,395
SOME OF THE OTHER SHARKS SAID.

00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:39,597
NOW, YOU'RE TRYING TO DO
DIFFERENT LINES, LIKE NASCAR.

00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:42,300
THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
ABOUT FIVE STYLES IN EACH LINE,

00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,202
AND EVERY ONE
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE

00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,571
AN AVERAGE OF SIZE 7
ALL THE WAY TO 13,

00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:51,276
AND HALF SIZES, IN EACH COLOR,
THREE SEPARATE TIMES.

00:36:51,276 --> 00:36:53,344
THAT CREATES
A LOGISTICAL NIGHTMARE,

00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:54,512
BECAUSE YOU TURN AROUND,

00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:58,583
AND THEN YOU HAVE $4 MILLION
WORTH OF LEFT SHOES.

00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:01,319
I WAS SOMEWHAT INTERESTED.
I WAS ON THE FENCE.

00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:04,355
UM...BUT I THINK THAT WE WOULD
HAVE A CHALLENGE.

00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:08,426
SO, UH, I'M OUT.

00:37:13,298 --> 00:37:15,266
SHARKS, ACTUALLY,
BEFORE WE CONTINUE,

00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:17,569
WE -- WE HAVE A, UH, AN
ADDITIONAL THING THAT WE --

00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:20,371
AS WE WERE PROMOTING THE SHOES,
WE ACTUALLY DEVELOPED

00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:23,641
PROPRIETARY E-MAIL MARKETING
SOFTWARE CALLED ATTLO.

00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:26,244
IT TAKES THE E-MAIL MARKETING
FROM THE INSIDE,

00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,213
AND IT SHOWS IT
IN THE SUBJECT LINE.

00:37:28,213 --> 00:37:31,249
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY, UH,
HOW WE PLAN TO PROMOTE THESE.

00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,618
Man: <i>WE'RE OPENING THE DOOR</i>
<i>TO NEW POSSIBILITIES.</i>

00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:36,421
<i>NO LONGER ARE WE CONFINED</i>
<i>TO JUST TEXT.</i>

00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:39,624
<i>99% OF MARKETING E-MAILS</i>
<i>HAVE IMAGES INSIDE THE E-MAIL.</i>

00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:41,493
<i>WITH ATTLO,</i>
<i>USERS CAN INSERT IMAGES</i>

00:37:41,493 --> 00:37:43,361
<i>IN THE SUBJECT</i>
<i>AND SENDER FIELD,</i>

00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:45,663
<i>GUARANTEEING RECIPIENTS</i>
<i>WILL SEE THEIR CONTENT,</i>

00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:47,265
<i>EVEN IF</i>
<i>THE E-MAIL'S NOT OPEN.</i>

00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,634
<i>THIS IS E-MAIL</i>
<i>AS NEVER SEEN BEFORE.</i>

00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:52,403
<i>THIS IS ATTLO.</i>

00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:53,505
YOU CAN DO THAT TODAY.

00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:56,341
WHO INVESTED IN THAT COMPANY?

00:37:56,341 --> 00:37:58,376
ME AND ANOTHER PROGRAMMER.

00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:00,411
MAN, YOU ARE FIGHTING
SO MANY BATTLES.

00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:03,448
LOOK, A GUY THAT USED TO WORK
FOR ME, HE WAS, AT ONE POINT,

00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:05,617
ACTUALLY THE 11th FASTEST MAN
IN THE WORLD.

00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,519
I RUN FIVE MILES A DAY,

00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:08,653
SO I USED TO SAY,
"HEY, LET'S GO RUNNING."

00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:11,322
AND HE WOULD SAY TO ME,
"I CAN'T RUN FIVE MILES."

00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:13,358
I SAID, "COME ON, MAN,
YOU'RE IN GREAT SHAPE.

00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:14,425
YOU CAN RUN FIVE MILES."

00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,294
"I DON'T RUN FIVE MILES.

00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,397
I RUN 100 METERS
AS FAST AS I CAN.

00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:21,566
THAT'S MY JOB."

00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:23,501
I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOUR JOB IS.

00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:25,570
YOU'RE DOING A PERFORMANCE SHOE.

00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:28,306
THEN YOU'RE DOING
E-MAIL SOFTWARE.

00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,242
THEN YOU'RE DOING A NASCAR SHOE?

00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:33,545
YOU'RE FIGHTING
TOO MANY BATTLES.

00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:36,648
IF YOU WANT TO WIN,
JUST RUN THE 100 METERS.

00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:38,550
FOCUS.

00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,552
BUT HERE'S MY CHALLENGE.

00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:43,621
I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH
ABOUT INVENTORY.

00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:45,323
I WANT TO BE INVOLVED.

00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:49,194
YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR $200,000 FOR 15%.

00:38:49,194 --> 00:38:51,296
I'M WILLING TO PUT UP
SOME OF THE MONEY,

00:38:51,296 --> 00:38:52,397
A PERCENTAGE OF THE MONEY.

00:38:52,397 --> 00:38:54,666
BUT IF YOU CAN TALK DAYMOND
TO COME BACK IN

00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:58,236
AND HE'LL HAVE ME AS A PARTNER,
I'M HAPPY TO COME ALONG,

00:38:58,236 --> 00:39:01,339
'CAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THE AREAS
WHERE INVENTORY CONTROL

00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:05,376
AND KNOWING HOW TO MAKE THIS
IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL,

00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:07,378
'CAUSE YOU CAN BURN THROUGH
$200,000

00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:08,646
[SNAPS FINGERS] LIKE THIS.

00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:10,348
SO THAT'S MY OFFER.

00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,484
I'LL PUT UP SOMETHING, AND
WE CAN FIGURE OUT THE EQUITY,

00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:15,520
IF YOU CAN GET DAYMOND
INTO THE RUNNING SHOES.

00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,224
DAYMOND,
IS THERE ANYTHING THEY CAN SAY

00:39:19,224 --> 00:39:21,659
TO CHANGE YOUR MIND --
YES OR NO?

00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,205
Narrator:
FOUR SHARKS ARE OUT.

00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,540
ROBERT IS INTERESTED

00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,476
IN JOEL AND ARSENE'S
ATHLETIC-SHOE COMPANY, FORUS,

00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:41,312
BUT ONLY IF DAYMOND
WILL JOIN HIM IN THE DEAL.

00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,314
Herjavec: IF YOU CAN TALK
DAYMOND TO COME BACK IN

00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:45,416
AND HE'LL HAVE ME AS A PARTNER,
I'M HAPPY TO COME ALONG,

00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:46,584
'CAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THE AREAS

00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:51,322
WHERE INVENTORY CONTROL
IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL,

00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:53,291
'CAUSE YOU CAN BURN THROUGH
$200,000

00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:54,325
[SNAPS FINGERS] LIKE THIS.

00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:56,694
DAYMOND,
IS THERE ANYTHING THEY CAN SAY

00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:58,329
TO CHANGE YOUR MIND --
YES OR NO?

00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,436
I DON'T BELIEVE SO.

00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:07,372
IS THERE ANY EQUITY THEY CAN
GIVE YOU TO CHANGE YOUR MIND?

00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:08,673
THE WHOLE DEAL'S CONTINGENT
ON YOU COMING BACK IN.

00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:09,674
HOW MUCH ARE YOU
WILLING TO GIVE?

00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:11,209
THE DEAL IS ONLY AS GOOD

00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:13,177
AS THE PERSON
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE,

00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:16,347
AND THIS INDIVIDUAL IS A
GO-GETTER WHO WON'T BE STOPPED,

00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:18,483
BUT HE ALSO HAS A VISION,

00:40:18,483 --> 00:40:20,285
AND I DON'T WANT TO ARGUE
WITH THE VISION.

00:40:20,285 --> 00:40:21,619
IF HE GAVE YOU 200K,
WOULD YOU DO IT?
I'M NOT GONNA ARGUE.

00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:23,688
I CAME HERE.
I WENT TO LAW SCHOOL.

00:40:23,688 --> 00:40:25,556
I HAD TO MOVE TO GO
TO LAW SCHOOL.
OFFER HIM SOMETHING.
DON'T TELL YOUR STORY ANYMORE.

00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:27,425
YES.
OFFER HIM SOMETHING TANGIBLE.

00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,694
I DON'T HAVE ANYBODY IN
MY FAMILY THAT DID BUSINESS.

00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:32,363
I LEARNED. YOU KNOW HOW
I GOT TO THIS POINT?

00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:33,431
BY LISTENING TO PEOPLE.

00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:34,666
YOU HAVE
AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT.

00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:35,633
I WILL LISTEN TO YOU,
BECAUSE --

00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:37,268
YOU HAVE -- LISTEN TO ME.

00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,436
YOU HAVE AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT.

00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,537
I DON'T WANT TO BE EXCELLENT.
I WANT TO BE AMAZING.

00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:40,538
AND YOU CAN GET ME TO AMAZING.
YES, I GOT IT.

00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:42,540
AND YOU'RE NOT
LISTENING TO ME NOW.

00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,644
SO, DAYMOND, ARE YOU OUT?

00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:48,279
I'M STILL OUT.

00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:53,384
LOOK, YOU GUYS ARE ALL IN.

00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:56,454
I LOVE THAT ABOUT YOU.
YOU ARE ALL FREAKIN' IN.

00:40:56,454 --> 00:41:01,192
MY ONLY HESITATION IS
THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW AREAS

00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:04,562
WHERE INVENTORY CONTROL
IS SO CRITICAL.

00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:08,266
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHERE TO SPEND THAT MONEY.

00:41:08,266 --> 00:41:10,468
I CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT SOMEBODY
LIKE DAYMOND.

00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:17,542
DAYMOND, WE ARE WILLING TO BE
ABLE TO FIND A COMPROMISE

00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:19,510
BETWEEN YOU
AND ROBERT, HERE,

00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:22,180
SO WE CAN REALLY LAUNCH
THIS COMPANY.

00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,614
DO YOU KNOW --
WE WAITED AND PRAYED

00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:26,351
TO GET A PATENT ISSUED.
WE GOT A PATENT ISSUED.

00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:29,687
I'M OUT.

00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:36,394
IF DAYMOND'S NOT IN,
I GOT TO BE OUT.

00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:41,599
OKAY.
THANK YOU.

00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:42,533
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
Greiner: GOOD LUCK.

00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:43,501
YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:49,640
Vinocur: YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY,
IT'S DISAPPOINTING

00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,309
TO NOT GET A DEAL
WITH THE SHARKS,

00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:52,377
BUT WE CAN WALK
OUT OF HERE

00:41:52,377 --> 00:41:53,644
KNOWING WHAT WE CAN DO
IN THE FUTURE

00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:55,480
AND KNOWING
THAT WE'RE GONNA BE GREAT.
