TELL ME YOUR SALES.

WOW.
WHOA.

00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:14,348
IF THE SHARKS
HEAR A GREAT IDEA...
BA-BAM!

00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,283
...THEY'LL INVEST
THEIR OWN MONEY

00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:18,218
AND FIGHT EACH OTHER
FOR A DEAL.

00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:21,154
I'LL GIVE YOU $200,000.
I WANT 50%.

00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:22,189
OH,
YOU'RE SO GENEROUS.

00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,291
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $200,000
FOR 25%.

00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,193
I'LL --
I'LL GO DOWN TO 25%.

00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,262
HMM, NOW IT GETS INTERESTING.
AND NOW IT GETS INTERESTING.

00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:30,230
Narrator: BUT THE ENTREPRENEURS
MUST GET THE FULL AMOUNT

00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,132
THEY'RE ASKING FOR...
OHH.

00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:34,167
...OR THEY'LL WALK AWAY
WITH NOTHING.
OOH.

00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,370
BUT KEVIN'S ALMOST RIGHT, RIGHT?
AND HE'S --
HE'S ALWAYS RIGHT.

00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,206
YOU BETTER ROLL UP YOUR
PANT LEGS WHEN YOU SAY THAT.

JUST MIGHT LIKE.

OF SURPRISES HERE.

00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:59,079
OHH! I LOVE THIS BOOK.
[ CHUCKLES ]

00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,213
IS THIS A MAGNET?

00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:01,281
THOSE ARE TRADING CARDS.
TRADING CARDS.

00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,417
YOU EACH HAVE YOUR OWN
COLLECTIBLE TRADING CARD.

00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,385
WHY -- WHY DON'T YOU WALK US
THROUGH YOUR BUSINESS MODEL.

00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:08,155
SO, LIKE A LOT OF START-UPS,
WE'RE CONSTANTLY EVOLVING.

00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:11,158
OKAY.
WHEN WE LAUNCHED THE COMPANY
3 1/2 YEARS AGO,

00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:13,193
THE PROBLEM THAT WE WERE
TRYING TO SOLVE WAS REALLY

00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:17,230
HOW TO MAKE PHYSICAL MUSIC
TANGIBLE AND RELEVANT.

00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,100
AND OUR INSIGHT
WAS THAT PHYSICAL MUSIC

00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,301
ISN'T SUPERIOR
TO DIGITAL MUSIC.

00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:25,238
WHY WOULD YOU GET IN YOUR CAR,
DRIVE TO THE STORE, BUY A CD,

00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,406
IF YOU WEREN'T GETTING
ANYTHING THAT WAS BETTER

00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,975
THAT YOU COULD JUST DOWNLOAD
ON YOUR COMPUTER

00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:31,311
OR STREAM ONLINE?
SO YOU WERE TRYING TO SUPPORT
THE DISTRIBUTION OF PHYSICAL CDs

00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,113
WITH ADDITIONAL CONTENT?
YES.

00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:34,281
YEAH, SO IF YOU'RE --
OKAY, SO JUST TELL US HOW --
TELL US YOUR MODEL...

00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:36,183
YEAH, TELL US HOW IT WORKS,
HOW YOU MAKE MONEY.

00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:38,251
...WHERE YOUR REVENUES ARE,
HOW YOU MAKE MONEY, ET CETERA.

00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,320
SURE.
YEAH, SO, WHEN AN ARTIST
IS PUTTING OUT AN ALBUM

00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,155
OR DOING A TOUR
OR ANYTHING,

00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,257
THEY COME TO US AND SAY,
"WE WANT TO CONNECT

00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:47,394
WITH OUR SUPER FANS
IN A WAY THAT'S REALLY ENGAGING

00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,229
AND ON OUR TERMS."
SO, IF YOU GUYS WILL

00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,364
LOOK AT THE BRAD PAISLEY
SAMPLE THAT YOU HAVE --

00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:53,433
THIS IS BRAD'S ALBUM RELEASE
THAT CAME OUT ABOUT A MONTH AGO.

00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:56,403
SO...
Herjavec: AND WHERE DOES
THIS COME? DOES IT --

00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,972
THIS IS IN WALMART.
OH, IT HAS THE RECORD
RIGHT IN IT?

00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,173
Hodack: YEAH. SO, THIS IS
THE DELUXE PACKAGING.

00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,175
Herjavec:
THAT'S VERY CLEVER.

00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,077
ALL RIGHT, SO, TELL ME YOUR
SALES FOR THE LAST 12 MONTHS.

00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,079
WELL, YEAR-TO-DATE,
WE'RE A LITTLE OVER $3 MILLION.

00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,981
OUR ZinePak PRODUCTS,

00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,182
SINCE WE LAUNCHED
3 1/2 YEARS AGO --

00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,351
JUST OVER $30 MILLION
IN WALMART STORES.

00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,153
WOW.
SO, A MUSIC PRODUCT,
AS YOU GUYS KNOW, IS 100% --

00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:16,323
SO, YOU'RE BASICALLY
A PACKAGING AGENCY, RIGHT?
THEY'RE AN AGENCY.

00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:17,457
WE ALSO DO
A LOT MORE THAN THAT.

00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,092
SO, FOR THE FIRST
COUPLE OF YEARS,

00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,194
WE WERE JUST FOCUSED
ON SOLVING THIS PROBLEM

00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:23,196
OF HOW DO WE MAKE
MUSIC RELEVANT AT WALMART.

00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,332
AND OUR CELEBRITY CLIENTS
CAME BACK TO US AND SAID,

00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:26,433
"WE LOVE WORKING WITH YOU,

00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,335
BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE
ANOTHER ALBUM FOR TWO YEARS.

00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:30,003
SO, WHAT CAN WE DO
IN THE MEANTIME?"

00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,204
SO, THAT'S WHEN
WE STARTED EXPANDING,

00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,073
AND ALL THE OTHER PRODUCTS THAT
YOU GUYS SEE IN FRONT OF YOU

00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:35,075
CAME OUT OF THAT INSIGHT,
SO --

00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:37,277
BRITTANY, HOW DID YOU --
HOW DID YOU COME TOGETHER?

00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,113
THE TWO OF US MET
IN LATE 2010.

00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,215
WE WERE WORKING AT AN
ADVERTISING AGENCY IN NEW YORK.

00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:45,385
THE IDEA FOR ZinePak WAS
ONE THAT I HAD IN COLLEGE.

00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,454
I WAS INTERNING
FOR A MAJOR RECORD COMPANY,

00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,290
AND EVERY INDUSTRY EXECUTIVE
WOULD SAY,

00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,092
"NOBODY'S BUYING
PHYSICAL MUSIC."

00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:53,293
AND I THOUGHT,
"WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE

00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,229
NOBODY'S MAKING PHYSICAL MUSIC
SUPERIOR TO ANYTHING ELSE."

00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,165
AND I WORKED AT A COUPLE
OF OTHER RECORD COMPANIES

00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:00,467
AFTER I GRADUATED,
AND NOBODY LIKED THIS IDEA.

00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:03,270
[ LAUGHS ]
I WAS ACTUALLY TOLD
BY MY BOSS AT ONE POINT,

00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,437
"I DON'T PAY YOU
TO HAVE IDEAS.

00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:07,140
I PAY YOU TO IMPLEMENT
THE IDEAS I GIVE YOU."

00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,075
AND I MET KIM.
Kaupe: [ LAUGHS ]

00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,978
AND KIM HAD SIMILAR FRUSTRATIONS
FROM THE PUBLISHING INDUSTRY,

00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,146
AND WE SAID,
"YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,081
IF WE DO THIS TOGETHER,
WITH MY BACKGROUND IN MUSIC

00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,316
AND YOUR BACKGROUND
IN PUBLISHING,

00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,218
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO
PULL THIS THING OFF."

00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:20,253
SO, YOU GUYS HAVE GOT
AN EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIP

00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,155
WITH WALMART, RIGHT?

00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,223
WE HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE
WITH WALMART

00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:24,324
ON THE ZinePak
CONFIGURATION,

00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,425
SO THE BRAD PAISLEY PACKAGE
THAT YOU'RE HOLDING,

00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,127
THAT'S A WALMART PRODUCT.
OKAY.

00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:29,229
NONE OF THE OTHER PRODUCT
ON THE TABLE IS WALMART PRODUCT.

00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:30,997
SO, WE'VE GROWN
OUTSIDE OF RETAIL,

00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,166
AND WE'VE GROWN
INTO TICKETING.

00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,168
THE LITTLE, SMALL TICKET THAT
YOU GUYS HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU...
Herjavec: THIS ONE?

00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:38,004
YES.
...THAT WAS THE TICKET
TO MUMFORD &amp; SONS'
TOUR LAST SUMMER.

00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:41,007
SO, WE CUSTOMIZED
ALL 140,000 TICKETS.

00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,242
IT'S THE FIRST TIME
IT'S EVER BEEN DONE

00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:43,944
ON SUCH
A LARGE SCALE BEFORE.

00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,045
I JUST WANT TO
POINT SOMETHING OUT

00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:47,147
ABOUT TRYING TO VALUE
WHAT YOU'RE WORTH TODAY.

00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:51,384
YOU HAVE A MASSIVE RISK,
'CAUSE YOU HAVE ONE CUSTOMER.

00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:54,154
LIKE, WHY AREN'T YOU TALKING
ABOUT BEST BUY AND TARGET

00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:56,456
AND OTHER CUSTOMERS
TO DIVERSIFY YOUR REVENUE?

00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:58,225
BECAUSE BEST BUY
AND TARGET SALES TOGETHER

00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:00,160
IN MUSIC DON'T EQUAL
WHAT WALMART SELLS.

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,261
[ ALL TALKING ]
BAM! [ CHUCKLES ]

00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:04,331
AND ONE OF THE THINGS
ABOUT OUR GROWTH --

00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:05,999
WE TURN DOWN
ABOUT 50% OF THE PEOPLE

00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:07,968
WHO COME TO US
ASKING FOR BUSINESS,

00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:09,336
BECAUSE WE WANT TO
KEEP IT EXCLUSIVE.

00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:11,171
WE WANT TO BE A PRODUCT
THAT'S JUST FOR SUPER FANS.

00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:13,173
ALL RIGHT, I MEAN,
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER

00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:15,275
IN TERMS OF WHAT
I THINK IT'S WORTH, OKAY?
[ CHUCKLING ]

00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:16,943
WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT'S WORTH, KEVIN?

00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:21,982
UM, I WOULD DO
THE $725,000 FOR 35%.

00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:24,050
THANK YOU FOR THE OFFER.

00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,019
AND THAT'S BASICALLY
WHAT A VENTURE FIRM
WOULD GIVE YOU TODAY.

00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:28,989
OTHERWISE, IT'S NOT COMMENSURATE
WITH THE RISK I'M TAKING.

00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:32,292
WELL, WE DON'T SEE IT
AS A RISK,

00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:33,460
BECAUSE, AS WE SAID,
WE'RE WORKING TO DO

00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,029
MORE AND MORE OF OUR BUSINESS
OUTSIDE OF WALMART.

00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:38,131
THE WALMART RELATIONSHIP
HAS BEEN AMAZING,

00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,367
BECAUSE OUR HISTORY
IN 3 1/2 YEARS WITH WALMART

00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:42,235
HAS ALLOWED US TO WORK WITH
75 DIFFERENT AMAZING ARTISTS.

00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,004
THAT'S PHENOMENAL, BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:45,272
YOU'VE GOT TO DIVERSIFY.

00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:48,108
WHAT DO YOU PROJECT YOUR SALES
TO BE NEXT YEAR?
$8 MILLION.

00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,378
SO, WHY DO YOU NEED US?

00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:53,013
SO, WE FEEL
VERY CONFIDENT

00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:54,180
ABOUT OUR ABILITY
IN THE MUSIC SPACE.

00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,283
WE'VE BEEN LIVING IT AND
BREATHING IT EVERY SINGLE DAY.

00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:59,219
WHERE WE ARE
GOING TO NEED HELP

00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:01,054
IS AS WE GROW
INTO OTHER VERTICALS.

00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:04,324
SO, WE KNOW THAT THIS IS AN
AMAZING OPPORTUNITY FOR SPORTS.

00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:06,459
AND, LOOK, I SEE WHAT
YOU GUYS ARE DOING. IT'S GREAT.

00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:09,462
BUT I ALSO SEE
THE DESPERATION SIDE, TOO.

00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,464
THE CHALLENGE IS
IT'S A DECLINING INDUSTRY,

00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:14,301
AS YOU KNOW -- PHYSICAL CDs --
AND YOU'RE AWARE OF THAT,

00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:17,037
AND YOU'RE LOOKING TO COMPLEMENT
ALL YOUR OTHER AREAS.

00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:19,439
YOU HAVEN'T REALLY GIVEN US A
STRATEGY TO GET BEYOND WALMART.

00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,074
I JUST --
I DON'T SEE THE FUTURE YET.

00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:23,076
AND FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.

00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:26,212
THANK YOU, MARK.

00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,081
Kaupe: FOR US, IT'S NOT
GONNA BE A DYING THING,

00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:31,051
BECAUSE THERE ARE SUPER FANS
OUT THERE FOR EVERYTHING.

00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:33,320
THAT'S WHY WHOLE COMPANIES
LIKE COMIC-CON EXIST,

00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,156
BECAUSE PEOPLE LOVE --
NASCAR, FORMULA 1.

00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:39,125
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE STILL BUILT
AROUND PHYSICAL, RIGHT?
AND YOU'RE SAYING THEY WANT
TO HAVE SOMETHING PHYSICAL?

00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,328
WE'RE GIVING PEOPLE SOMETHING
TO HOLD AND SOMETHING TO LOVE.
THAT'S BECAUSE SUPER FANS
LIKE TO HOLD IT.

00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:43,296
John: OKAY, GUYS. LET ME --
LET ME -- LET ME HELP.
SO...

00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,165
LISTEN, HERE, I'M GONNA TAKE
A FLIER WITH YOU.

00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:49,436
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $725,000

LADIES, YOU DID
AN AMAZING JOB TODAY.

00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:57,010
I GET IT RIGHT AWAY, AND I GET
THE EXTENSION TO THE SUPER FAN.

00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,979
I THINK THAT'S WHAT SOME
OF THE OTHER SHARKS ARE MISSING.

00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,081
I GET IT, TOO.
I ALMOST THINK THAT, YOU KNOW,

00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:05,218
SOMETIMES WHEN SOMETHING,
LIKE, JUST SEEMS TO GO AWAY,

00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,387
SOME PEOPLE START
TO REALLY MISS IT MORE

00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:09,289
AND WANT SOMETHING TANGIBLE --
AND EXCLUSIVE.

00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:10,290
A KEEPSAKE.

00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,491

I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER.

00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:19,366
I WOULD LIKE, THOUGH,
TO HAVE ROBERT COME IN WITH ME.

00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:24,337
WE WOULD GIVE YOU $725,000
FOR 20%.

00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,139
I'M HAPPY TO GO ALONG
WITH LORI.

00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:27,307
I THINK
SHE'S THE RIGHT PARTNER.

00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:29,075
I THINK WE BRING
DIFFERENT THINGS TO IT.

00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:30,276
I'LL GO DOWN TO 25%.

00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:36,316

BETWEEN ROBERT AND LORI.

AND I JUST
WANT TO CLARIFY --

00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,289
OUR SALES WILL BE CLOSE
TO $4 MILLION THIS YEAR.

00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,158
THAT $3 MILLION IS
OUR YEAR-TO-DATE.

00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:48,328
I WILL ADJUST DOWN TO 30%,
THEN, IF THAT'S TRUE.
OH, YOU'RE SO GENEROUS.

00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,298
THOSE ARE SERIOUS OFFERS.
THAT'S A LOT OF CASH
IN THE SHARK TANK.

TWO YEARS AHEAD.

GET IT RIGHT EVERY TIME.

ABOUT THE DEAL WE MADE.

IT WAS A LITTLE MORE EQUITY
THAN WE WANTED TO GIVE UP.

00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:50,450
BUT FOR TWO SHARKS,
IT WAS A GAME WELL PLAYED.

AND I'M DEAN WHITNEY.

00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:48,101

TO THE BARTENDER.

BUT AS WE ALL KNOW,
SOMETIMES IT'S IMPOSSIBLE

00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,293
TO GET A SEAT
AT THE BAR.

00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,461
NATURALLY, WE THOUGHT, "THERE'S
GOT TO BE AN APP FOR THAT."

AND TO CREATE LIFELONG FANS.

WE'VE CREATED AN INCREDIBLE

AND WE'VE PROVEN THAT
WITH SOME AMAZING BARS.

00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:55,268
SO, THE ONLY QUESTION
WE HAVE LEFT, SHARKS --

00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:56,436
WHO WANTS
TO SNAG A STOOL?!

00:13:56,436 --> 00:14:00,273
WHY DO I NEED YOU?
YOU SAID "OFF-PEAK TIMES."

00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:02,008
IF I OWN THE BAR
AND IT'S OFF-PEAK,

00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,142
THE BAR STOOL IS EMPTY
ANYWAY.

00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:05,311
YOU DON'T
NEED TO RESERVE IT.

00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,246
IF THE BAR IS
SUPER-BUSY,

00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:10,249
WHAT'S THE BENEFIT TO ME
TO LEAVE THE BAR STOOL EMPTY

00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:11,351
WAITING FOR YOU?

00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,186
SOMEONE'S ALWAYS GONNA
SIT IN IT.

00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,287
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:16,456
SO, THERE ARE TWO TIME PERIODS
ON SnagaStool,

00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:19,025
AND WE'VE --
WE'VE IDENTIFIED THOSE

00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,361
AS "PEAK TIMES"
AND "OFF-PEAK TIMES."
OKAY.

00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,395
AND DURING
THE OFF-PEAK TIMES,

00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,364
THAT'S WHEN BARS
WILL OFFER INCENTIVES,

00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:27,200
LIKE A FREE BEER
OR A FREE APPETIZER,

00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,969
TO ATTRACT PEOPLE TO THEIR BAR
TO FILL THOSE STOOLS.

00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:32,038
OKAY, SO, I GO ON YOUR APP,
I GET A FREE BEER?
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,006
AND THE ADVANTAGE TO THE BAR
IS THEY GET CUSTOMERS IN

00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:36,109
WHEN IT'S NOT BUSY.
ABSOLUTELY.

00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:38,945
I COULD SEE, LIKE, PEOPLE JUST
REALLY BEING PISSED OFF...

00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:41,381

INTO THEIR FAVORITE BAR...
YEAH.

00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,949
...IT'S JAM-PACKED...
MM-HMM.

00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:44,384

LIKE THAT ON THE STOOLS.

Cuban: I COULD SEE
HAVING THOSE THERE

00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:48,421
COULD BE LIKE --
MAKE IT INTERESTING, RIGHT?

00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:50,323
"WHO'S COMING? WHO'S COMING?
IT'S RESERVED."

00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:52,158
JUST LIKE WHEN YOU SEE
RESERVED TABLES.

00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:55,261
I'M FROM BOSTON, OKAY? I'VE
NEVER HEARD OF THIS, ALL RIGHT?

00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,196
LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE EL SUPREMO BAR STOOL --

00:14:57,196 --> 00:15:02,335
UPSTAIRS BAR, GRILL 23,
PATS GAME ON A SUNDAY.

00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:04,137
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
FOR ME THERE?

00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:06,139
I'M NOT HAVING ANY TROUBLE
FILLING THAT BAR.

00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:08,975
IN FACT, PEOPLE ARE SCREAMING
TO SIT IN ONE OF THOSE SEATS.

00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:10,009
SO, HOW DOES IT WORK?

00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:11,244
LET'S SAY I WANT TO GO
TO A PATS GAME

00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,413
AND I DON'T WANT TO SIT THERE
FOR TWO HOURS TO KEEP MY SEAT.

00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,248
IS THERE ANY WAY
I CAN USE YOUR APP

00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:18,184
TO RESERVE MY SEAT
15 MINUTES BEFORE GAME TIME?

00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:22,188
IT DEPENDS ON IF THE BAR HAS
ENOUGH INVENTORY OF STOOLS

00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:24,490
AND IF THEY HAVEN'T
BEEN SNAGGED UP TO THAT POINT.

00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,160
'CAUSE THEY ALLOCATE
A CERTAIN AMOUNT FOR YOU?
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,228
NOT ALL BAR STOOLS ARE --
ARE OPEN FOR THE SERVICE.

00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:32,131
PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY
FOR THIS EXPERIENCE.

00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,300
SO, FOR PEOPLE
WHO AREN'T ABLE TO

00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,269
GET TO THE BAR
TWO OR THREE HOURS EARLY --

00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,437
PEOPLE
WHO ARE WORKING LATE,

00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,272
PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE
THE ABILITY TO SIT

00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,007
AND NURSE A BEER
FOR HOURS --

00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:43,042
THESE BARS NOW HAVE
THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE --

00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,977
SO, HOW DO YOU CHARGE?
HOW DO YOU CHARGE?

00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:46,446
SO, WE CHARGE BY THE HOUR
OR BY THE GAME,

00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:49,215
DEPENDING ON WHAT THE BAR
WOULD LIKE TO CHARGE.
OKAY, SO, GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE.

00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:51,417
YEAH, SO -- SO, RIGHT NOW,
WE'VE PARTNERED

00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,319
WITH SOME AMAZING BARS
IN THE BOSTON AREA.

00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:56,088
HOW MANY?
SO, RIGHT NOW,
WE'RE WITH THREE BARS.

00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,089
AND THAT'S WHAT --
THREE?

00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:59,158
THREE BARS.
YEP. YEP.

00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,360
GUYS, I GET YOU GOT TO CRAWL
BEFORE YOU BALL.
YEAH.

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,062
BUT WHY
JUST THREE BARS?

00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:05,298
SO, WE JUST WANTED TO START OFF
WITH A PILOT,

00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,365
AND WE REALLY WANTED TO
PARTNER WITH PEOPLE

00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,067
WHO REALLY BELIEVED
IN THE CONCEPT.

00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:11,204
WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE REVENUE
FROM THESE BECAUSE --

00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:12,371
ALL RIGHT.
YOU HAVE NO SALES.

00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:14,006
LITTLE LESS.
IT'S -- IT'S OUR
PROOF OF CONCEPT.

00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:17,043
THERE ARE SO MANY APPS
RIGHT NOW DESIGNED FOR BARS.

00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:19,245
WHY ARE THEY EVEN
GOING TO DEAL WITH YOU

00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:21,080
WHEN YOU'RE JUST
ONE OF 50 APPS

00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,082
THAT ARE --
THAT ARE APPROACHING THEM?

00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:24,250
SO, MARK,
IN -- IN OUR OPINION,

00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,153
THE -- THE ART OF BARTENDING
HAS DIED SLOWLY.

00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,255
WE'RE TRYING TO
GET BACK TO THE DAYS

00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:30,323
WHEN A BARTENDER
REACHED ACROSS THE BAR

00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,458
AND KNEW YOUR NAME,
KNEW WHO YOU WERE.

00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,260
DON'T DISM--
YOU BETTER ROLL UP YOUR
PANT LEGS WHEN YOU SAY THAT,

00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,428
RIGHT, BECAUSE --
DON'T DISMISS THIS,

00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:36,462
BECAUSE IT MEANS A LOT.

00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,231
BECAUSE THAT'S
HOW YOU BUILD LOYALTY

00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:40,299
IS BY PROVIDING
AN ENHANCED CUSTOMER SERVICE.

00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,268
YEAH, BUT THAT'S NOT
WHAT YOU'RE SELLING, THOUGH.
IT'S NOT --

00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:44,103
O'Leary: EXCEPT, YOU KNOW,
THERE'S SOMETHING INTRIGUING

00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:45,271
ABOUT YOUR CONCEPT
BECAUSE THERE'S

00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:48,007
PROBABLY 25 STOOLS
UPSTAIRS AT GRILL 23,

00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,077
ANOTHER 40 DOWNSTAIRS
AT THE DOWNSTAIRS BAR.

00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:53,379
THEY ARE THE MOST COVETED SEATS
FOR ANY GAME IN BOSTON.

00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,948
SO, WHY DO THEY NEED THEM?
BUT WAIT. HERE ME OUT ON THIS.

00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:58,050
IF I COULD GO TO THEM SAY,

00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,086
"LOOK, GIVE ME
20% OF YOUR INVENTORY,

00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:03,022
AND I'LL GUARANTEE YOU
$200 FOR THAT SEAT."

00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:06,025
BUT KEVIN'S ALMOST RIGHT, RIGHT?
AND HE'S --
HE'S ALWAYS RIGHT.

00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,461
[ CHUCKLES ]
LOOK, THE ONLY WAY THAT I THINK
THIS IS GOING TO WORK

00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:11,230
IS IF YOU WENT TO THIS 23,
AND YOU SAID "YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:15,301
I'M GONNA GUARANTEE YOU
$10,000 UP FRONT."

00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:17,136
THEN YOU HAVE INVENTORY.

00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:18,971
WELL, IT'S NOT EVEN
FOR INVENTORY.

00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,373
IT SHOWS THEM
THE VALUE THAT YOU BRING.

00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,141
WELL, YOU HAVE A GUARANTEED
REVENUE STREAM, THEN.

00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:23,175
RIGHT, IT'S NEWFOUND REVENUE.
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON
THEY'D DO IT.

00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,310
YEAH, AND YOU JUST SAY,
"YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,345
GIVE ME FIVE BAR STOOLS
EVERY FRIDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT.

00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:28,014
I'M GONNA WRITE YOU
THE CHECK IN ADVANCE,

00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:29,949
AND WHAT THEY SPEND ON THE BAR
IS STILL YOURS."

00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:31,183
YOU GUYS KEEP ON SAYING,

00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:33,386
"THERE'S VALUE,
THERE'S VALUE, THERE'S VALUE,"

00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:36,289
BUT YOU HAVEN'T SHOWN
A WAY TO SELL THAT VALUE.

00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:38,424
AND BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
ABLE TO FIGURE THAT OUT,

00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:41,160
I'M OUT.

00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,162
I'M NOT A BAR GUY,
AND I CAN'T HELP YOU IN THIS.

00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:44,196
I'M OUT.

00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,265
[ LAUGHS ]

00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,167
THE ADVANTAGE TO THE BAR IS
YOU'RE GONNA GET MORE MONEY

00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:49,435
THAN YOU WOULD NORMALLY.

00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:53,205
SO, IF I KNOW ON A BUSY NIGHT
I'M MAKING $500 A SEAT,

00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:55,007
AND, GOING BACK
TO MARK'S POINT,

00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:58,277
YOU'RE GONNA GUARANTEE ME
$1,000 ON A CONSISTENT BASIS,

00:17:58,277 --> 00:17:59,278
I'M IN.

00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:01,948
OTHERWISE,
I DON'T NEED YOU.

00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:03,983
WELL, BARS ALSO --
YOU'RE SELLING ACCESS
TO SOMETHING

00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:07,119
THAT, IN PEAK TIMES,
GETS SOLD OUT ANYWAY.

00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:11,390
THE -- THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM
IS YOU'RE SELLING

00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,327
THE REAL ESTATE NOBODY WANTS
THROUGH YOUR SERVICE

00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:16,128
AND NOT THE STUFF
THAT'S REALLY HARD TO GET.

00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:19,098
FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.

00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,234
THERE'S DEFINITELY
SOMETHING TO IT,

00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:25,972
BECAUSE PEOPLE
LIKE TO FEEL SPECIAL.

00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:27,139
SO, BY BEING ABLE TO
RESERVE A SEAT,

00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,041
THEY GET THE CONVENIENCE,

00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:32,144
THEY GET TO WATCH THE GAME,
AND THEY ALSO FEEL SPECIAL.

00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:33,312
SO I GET THAT.

00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:36,983
MY PROBLEM IS
IT'S JUST TOO EARLY.

00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:40,353
YOU ONLY HAVE THREE BARS.
YOU'RE JUST STARTING.

00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:42,254
THERE'S NO PROOF
OF THE CONCEPT YET, FOR ME.

00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:45,091
AND FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.

00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:48,995
AND THEN THERE WAS ONE.

00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:51,030
ALL ROADS LEAD
BACK TO MR. WONDERFUL,
AND HERE WE ARE AGAIN.

00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,367
YOU KNOW, THERE'S A KERNEL OF
A REALLY INTERESTING IDEA HERE.

00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,102
MM-HMM.
THE TEST SHOULD BE

00:18:56,102 --> 00:19:00,106
WITH A BAR THAT ACTUALLY HAS
INCREDIBLY VALUABLE REAL ESTATE.

00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:02,975
I'VE BEEN GOING TO GRILL 23
FOR 20 YEARS WITH MY BUDDIES

00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,210
TO WATCH PAT GAMES.

00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:08,381
THERE IS NO PRICE I WOULDN'T PAY
TO SIT THERE WITH THEM, OKAY?

00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:11,050
BUT THE HASSLE IS
I GOT TO GO TWO HOURS EARLY

00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,251
TO ESTABLISH MY REAL ESTATE.

00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,153
IF YOU CAME IN HERE
AND SAID,

00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,288
"WE'VE CUT A DEAL
WITH GRILL 23,"

00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,257
YOU'D HAVE A HELL
OF AN AUCTION GOING ON.

00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,192
THAT'S NOT
WHAT YOU BROUGHT ME.

00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:21,360
YOU BROUGHT ME SORT OF
"LET'S BRING

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,130
SOME INCREMENTAL DOLLARS IN
AT A REALLY BAD TIME."

00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,265
I WANT TO MAKE MONEY
GETTING ACCESS

00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:29,135
TO REAL ESTATE
THAT I COVET.

00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:30,369
THAT'S WHAT THE INTERNET
WOULD BE GREAT AT.

00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,071
THAT'S WHERE
YOUR MODEL WOULD WORK.

00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:34,240
AND YOU SHOW ME A BAR LIKE
GRILL 23 AGREEING TO DO THAT,

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,242
THEN I KNOW YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING
THAT GOES NATIONWIDE.

00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:38,210
I INVITE YOU BACK
WHEN IT'S FIXED,

00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,080
AND I'M NOT PAYING A DIME MORE
THAN YOUR VALUATION TODAY,

00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,249
'CAUSE I GAVE YOU
ALL THE GOOD IDEAS.

00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:45,351
I MEAN, I SHOULD OWN
YOUR BUSINESS BY NOW.
NO, YOU TOOK <i>MY</i> GOOD IDEA.

00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,186
WE JUST GAVE YOU A LESSON
ON HOW TO FIX IT.

00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,455
THERE'S NOTHING TO
INVEST IN HERE. I'M OUT.

00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:51,257
YOU GUYS DID NOT GIVE US
THESE IDEAS.

00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:53,059
THESE IDEAS CAME TO US
IN THE LAST FIVE MONTHS

00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,260
OF TESTING
WITH THESE BARS.

00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,163
GUYS, I THINK WE'RE DONE HERE.
WE'LL SEE YOU AT GRILL 23.

00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:58,264
THEY CAN'T GET A SEAT.
YEAH, THAT'S A PROBLEM.

00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:00,199
THANK YOU.
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.

00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,967
John: GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
Greiner: THANK YOU. GOOD LUCK.

00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:07,406
Manning:
SnagaStool IS A TINDERBOX

00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:09,408
READY TO JUST TAKE OFF,
AND WE'RE REALLY GONNA TAKE THIS

00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:12,278
TO THE NEXT LEVEL
IN THE NEXT YEAR.

00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,455
I'M ERIK.
AND I'M SASHA.

00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:24,056
AND OUR COMPANY
IS BUCK MASON.

00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,058
AND WE'RE BASED
IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA.

00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,326
AMERICAN MEN ARE READY

00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,195
FOR A DIFFERENT TYPE
OF FASHION BRAND --

00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:32,264
ONE THAT'S ROOTED IN COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT SENSIBILITIES,

00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:33,365
NOT CONNECTED
TO FASHION.

00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,134
THIS IS A REAL
TROCHUS-SHELL BUTTON.

00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:36,302
AND WE HAVE
A BUSINESS MODEL

00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:38,404
THAT SIMPLIFIES
THE SHOPPING EXPERIENCE

00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,172
AND MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE
FOR GUYS TO MESS UP.

00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,942
HOW'S THE NECKLINE
THIS TIME?

00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:44,143
Erik: 20 3/8, BABY.

00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:46,946
AMERICAN-MADE IS ABSOLUTELY
A PRIORITY FOR US.

00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:48,314
MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
THAT LESS THAN 2% OF CLOTHING

00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:51,350
PURCHASED IN AMERICA IS
ACTUALLY MADE IN AMERICA.

00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,352
WE REALLY NEED TO
PRESS THE COLLAR OUT
AND GET ALL THE WRINKLES OUT.

00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,154
THE IDEA OF NOT HAVING
A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP

00:20:55,154 --> 00:20:58,457
WITH THE CRAFTSMEN MAKING
OUR JEANS, MAKING OUR SHIRTS

00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,126
JUST DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE TO US.

00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:01,293
YOUR TOTAL'S GONNA BE
88 BUCKS.

00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,329
Sasha: SINCE WE'VE LAUNCHED
LESS THAN A YEAR AGO,

00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:05,030
OUR BUSINESS HAS BEEN
GROWING RAPIDLY,

00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,332
AND EVERY NEW PRODUCT
THAT WE CREATE

00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:07,399
SELLS OUT IMMEDIATELY.

00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,435
WE NEED THIS INVESTMENT
TO CREATE ENOUGH INVENTORY

00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:10,436
TO KEEP UP WITH DEMAND.

00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:12,238
THE SHARKS
SHOULDN'T INVEST IN US

00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:13,339
JUST BECAUSE
WE'RE MADE IN AMERICA.

00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:15,107
THEY SHOULD INVEST IN US
BECAUSE WE'RE PROVING

00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,375
THAT AMERICAN-MADE CAN
ACTUALLY BE PROFITABLE,

00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,445
AND WE'RE DOING THAT
DAY AFTER DAY.

00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:36,128
HI, SHARKS.
I'M ERIK SCHNAKENBERG.

00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,263
AND I'M SASHA KOEHN.

00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:39,031
WE'RE FROM LOS ANGELES,
CALIFORNIA.

00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:40,266
OUR COMPANY IS
BUCK MASON.

00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:42,401
WE'RE SEEKING $200,000

00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,103
IN EXCHANGE
FOR 8% OF OUR COMPANY.

00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:47,306
GROWING UP, I ALWAYS THOUGHT
MY FATHER DRESSED COOL.

00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,175
HE WORE THE EXACT SAME THING
EVERY DAY --

00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:52,011
BEAT-UP BLUE JEANS,
A WHITE V-NECK "T,"

00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:53,979
AND A FLANNEL
WORK SHIRT.

00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,147
HE WAS A BRICK MASON,

00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,116
SO I GUESS HE WASN'T
TRYING TO LOOK COOL.

00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:59,051
HE WAS SIMPLY DRESSING
OUT OF FUNCTION.

00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,187
THESE DAYS, IT'S PRETTY EASY
FOR A GUY TO GET OVERWHELMED

00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:02,221
WHEN IT COMES TO SHOPPING --

00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:04,990
TOO MANY CHOICES,
TOO MANY TRENDS,

00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,425
TOO MANY PRODUCTS
COMING FROM COUNTRIES
WE'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF.

00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:09,361
WE'VE CREATED BUCK MASON
TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY,

00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:12,364

AT AN ACCESSIBLE PRICE POINT.

00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:13,999
WE FOCUS ON THE BASICS,

00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,335
LIKE THE PERFECT T-SHIRT,
THE QUINTESSENTIAL BLUE JEAN,

00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,237
AND THE CLASSIC
OXFORD SHIRT.

00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:20,139
ON OUR WEBSITE,
WE SHOW OUR CUSTOMERS

00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:21,941
HOW OUR PRODUCTS
ARE BEING MADE

00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:24,109
AND WHO'S ACTUALLY
MAKING THEM.

00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,412
WE CALL THIS AMERICAN-MADE
PRICE TRANSPARENCY.

00:22:26,412 --> 00:22:29,248
AT BUCK MASON,
WE'RE IGNORING FASHION TRENDS.

00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:31,016
IT'S NOT ABOUT STANDING OUT
OR FITTING IN.

00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,418
IT'S ABOUT TASTE.

00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:34,987
AND, LISTEN, WE'RE NOT
YOUR ORDINARY FASHION DESIGNERS.

00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:36,355
WE'RE TWO MIDWESTERN GUYS
OBSESSED

00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,190

AMERICAN QUALITY.

WHO WANTS TO HELP US BUILD

00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,994
THE NEXT GREAT
AMERICAN CLOTHING BRAND?

CAN WE SEE
SOME OF THE CLOTHES?

00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:46,298
OF COURSE.
YEAH, SASHA'S GONNA
HAND YOU SOME.

Cuban: YEAH,
SAVE MY SIZE FOR ME.

DO YOU HAVE
MY 28-INCH WAIST?
[ CHUCKLES ]

00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,407
OH, THIS FEELS NICE.

00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:57,142
Sasha: THANK YOU.

00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:58,277
SO, ERIK, WALK ME THROUGH
HOW I BUY IT.

00:22:58,277 --> 00:22:59,411
WHERE DO I GET THEM?
SURE.
SURE.

00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:01,080
WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS

00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,283
DIRECT TO CONSUMER ONLINE
THROUGH THE BUCK MASON WEBSITE.

00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:05,317
THERE'S TWO WAYS
TO PURCHASE PRODUCTS.

00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:07,086
ONE IS THE INDIVIDUAL
SINGLE ITEMS,

00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:09,421
WHICH, AS YOU CAN SEE,
ARE REALLY WEARABLE.

00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:12,324
THEY'RE COOL NOW. THEY'LL
BE COOL 50 YEARS FROM NOW.

00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:15,327
THERE IS ANOTHER WAY THAT WE
SELL MERCHANDISE ON THE SITE,

00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,129
AND THAT'S
THROUGH CURATED PACKAGES.

00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:18,297
SO, WHAT WE DO IS
WE PUT TOGETHER

00:23:18,297 --> 00:23:22,001
THREE TO SIX PIECES
THAT YOU CANNOT MESS UP.

00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:23,068
THE REASON
WHY IT WOULD WORK FOR YOU

00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,169
IS BECAUSE IT'S FOR GUYS
THAT ARE JUST BUSY,

00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:26,005
YOU KNOW, GUYS THAT DON'T
HAVE TIME TO SHOP.

00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:27,039
OR GUYS THAT HAVE
NO FASHION SENSE.

[ CHUCKLES ]
AND WHAT DO YOU CHARGE
FOR A PAIR OF JEANS?

00:23:30,376 --> 00:23:32,411
SO, THOSE JEANS
ARE $135.

00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,346
$135 IS NOT CHEAP
FOR A PAIR OF JEANS.

00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:37,049
THE $135
IS A GREAT VALUE

00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:38,350
FOR THE PRODUCT
THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY MAKING.

00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,085
FOR AMERICAN-MADE,

00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:43,422
WE'RE ABOUT AS COMPETITIVE
AS YOU CAN GET FOR THE PRICE.

00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,392
OKAY, AND WHAT ABOUT THE SHIRTS?
THE T-SHIRTS ARE $24.

00:23:46,392 --> 00:23:48,060
BUTTON-DOWN SHIRTS
ARE $88.

YOUR SALES SO FAR?

00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:51,330
OUR SALES ARE $300,000.

00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:53,432
IN WHAT TIME PERIOD?

00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,034
EIGHT MONTHS.
EIGHT MONTHS.

00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:56,969
WHAT DID YOU DO FOR A LIVING
BEFORE YOU DID THIS?

00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:58,971
I'VE SPENT 15 YEARS
IN THE APPAREL BUSINESS.

00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:00,205
AND I COME FROM THE TOTALLY
OPPOSITE END OF THE SPECTRUM.

00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:02,308
I COME FROM
MORE TECH/MEDIA SIDE.

00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:04,310
PRIOR TO STARTING
BUCK MASON WITH ERIK,

00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,278
I CREATED AN
INTERACTIVE-CONTENT PLATFORM

00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,313
CALLED
"THIS BUILT AMERICA"

00:24:07,313 --> 00:24:10,082
PROFILING COMPANIES
THAT ARE REIMAGINING

00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:11,083
AMERICAN MANUFACTURING.

00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,484
OH, THAT'S COOL.
GOOD FOR YOU.

00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:16,055
AND IT DID NOTHING BUT INSPIRE
ME TO BE COMPLETELY PASSIONATE

00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:17,456
ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING.
IF I BECOME A CUSTOMER,

00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,059
AND I BUY, LET'S SAY,
A SHIRT AND JEANS,

00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:22,194
I LIKE IT, HOW MANY
MORE TIMES IN A YEAR

00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,295
DO I BUY?

00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,463
WHAT'S THE LIFETIME VALUE
OF ONE OF THESE GUYS?

00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:27,466
WELL, 38% OF OUR CUSTOMERS ARE
REPEAT IN THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS.

00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,201
THAT'S GOOD.
AND OF THAT 38%,

00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:32,104
10% HAVE PURCHASED
MORE THAN THREE TIMES.
THAT'S AMAZING.

00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:34,006
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.
SO, YOU GOT GUYS
BUYING A WHITE T-SHIRT,

REALIZING THEY LIKE IT,

FIVE MORE AT A TIME.

AND THAT'S HOW GUYS SHOP.

00:24:38,277 --> 00:24:39,311
WHAT MATTERS IS BRAND,

00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,046
AND I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO.

00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:44,316
BUCK MASON IS AN AMERICAN,
HEARTFELT BRAND,

00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,085
AND YOU'RE GONNA PICK
A PRICE POINT

00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:48,120
WHERE YOU THINK YOUR
CUSTOMER-ACQUISITION COST ONLINE

00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,055
IS GONNA BE LESS
THAN THEIR LIFETIME VALUE.

00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:51,323
THAT'S WHAT
THIS BUSINESS MODEL IS.

00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,392
'CAUSE I DON'T HEAR
A RETAIL ROLL-OUT STRATEGY.

00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:56,328
I DON'T HEAR YOU PUTTING UP
RETAIL STORES IN SoHo.
IS HE RIGHT?

00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,997
HE'S PARTIALLY RIGHT.

00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:00,032
WE HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL
TO DATE WITH ACQUIRING CUSTOMERS

00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:02,001
AT VERY LITTLE
TO ABSOLUTELY NO COST.

00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:03,102
AND WE'VE BEEN DOING IT

00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:05,270
THROUGH BOTH OUR SOCIAL
AND P.R. CHANNELS.

00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,072
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS
THROUGH SOCIAL.

00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,273
IT'S BEEN A VALUABLE TOOL
FOR US.

00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:09,975
SO, GIVE US
YOUR METRICS ON SOCIAL.

00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:11,243
INSTAGRAM'S BEEN
VERY HELPFUL.

00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:13,078
WE HAVE
AN INFLUENCER PROGRAM, OKAY?

00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:14,380
WE IDENTIFY PEOPLE
THAT WE RELATE TO

00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,414
VERY WELL ON INSTAGRAM.

00:25:15,414 --> 00:25:17,316
THEY HAVE VERY HIGH AMOUNTS
OF FOLLOWERS.

00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:18,350
MOST OF THEM
ARE PHOTOGRAPHERS,

00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,485
AND THE REASON WHY
WE FOCUS ON THEM

00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:21,487
AND NOT SPECIFICALLY PUTTING
A LOT OF EFFORT

00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:24,056
INTO FASHION BLOGGERS
IS 'CAUSE, MORE OR LESS,

00:25:24,056 --> 00:25:25,290
WE'RE
AN ANTI-FASHION BRAND.

00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:28,160
LIKE, WE'RE FOCUSING
ON THE BASICS AND THE CLASSICS.

00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,062
WE'RE NOT FOLLOWING TRENDS.
THAT MAKES SENSE.

00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:32,398
AND OUR CUSTOMER IS
FOLLOWING THESE PHOTOGRAPHERS,
NOT THE FASHION BLOGS.

00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:34,400
THEY'RE NOT <i>GQ</i> GUYS.
AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING
FOR THESE PHOTOGRAPHERS?

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,301

TO TAKE THE $200,000

00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:42,374
AND ACCELERATE
THE EXISTING BUSINESS MODEL,

00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,277
OR ARE YOU GONNA EXPAND INTO
RETAIL OR GO INTO WHOLESALE?

00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:47,980

WITH THIS BUSINESS MODEL?

HAVE YOU GUYS INVESTED?

OURSELVES.

WE THINK THAT
WE'LL MAKE ABOUT --

00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:03,328
PROBABLY ABOUT $35,000
ON THAT.

Cuban: GUYS, I THINK
WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS GREAT,

00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:26,085
FARTHER DOWN THE ROAD -- I'M
NOT SURE HOW MUCH I COULD ADD

00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:28,387

WHAT'S REALLY RIGHT

00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:32,424

AS AN ONLINE COMPANY,

00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,112

AT AROUND FOUR TIMES
THEIR CASH FLOW.

00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:06,225
AND THEY'RE MUCH LARGER
THAN YOU ARE.

00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:09,061
SO, YOU NEED TO BE MAKING
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN $600,000

00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:13,999
AND $750,000 AFTER TAX TO GET
A VALUATION OF $2.5 MILLION.

OF YOUR VALUATION HERE.

WHAT YOU'RE WORTH YET.

TO SHOW SOME TRACTION.

I LOVE THE BRANDING.
I REALLY DO.

OUT OF SOMEBODY,

TO PART WITH HALF THE COMPANY.

YOU'RE INVESTING IN HERE

00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:34,319

AND THE TALENT ON BOARD.

IS SOMEWHAT CRAZY.

DO IN THE FUTURE, I GUESS.

IN THE FUTURE, RIGHT?

00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:11,323
YOU'RE WORTH A PARTNERSHIP
AND THE BEGINNING OF A BRAND

00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:13,258
THAT NO ONE'S HEARD OF
UNTIL TODAY.

00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:16,428
SO THE ONLY WAY
I CAN DO THIS DEAL IS

00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:19,298
I'LL GIVE YOU $200,000,
I WANT 50%.

00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:21,333
AND EVEN THAT'S GENEROUS.

00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:23,135
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO DO IT,

00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:26,004
BECAUSE YOU'RE SO FAR FROM --
FROM MAKING MONEY.

00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:28,006
I MEAN, HOW ARE YOU GUYS
EVEN EATING?

00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:29,174
THAT'S WHY THEY MAKE
SKINNY JEANS.

00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:31,176
ERIK AIRBNB's HIS PLACE AND
CRASHES ON MY COUCH SOMETIMES.

00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:34,012
WELL, THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.
I MEAN, THAT -- THAT
IS A START-UP.

00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:36,081
YOU ARE GOVERNED BY GRAVITY.
John: IS THAT YOUR OFFER?

00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:37,349
IT'S MY ONLY OFFER.
Greiner: NO, YOU GUYS --

00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:39,318
I'LL GIVE YOU $200,000
FOR 50%.
Herjavec: YEAH.

00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:40,986
I'LL HELP
GET YOUR WORD OUT.

00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:43,088
I'M PROBABLY, OBVIOUSLY,
GONNA BE ONE OF YOUR CUSTOMERS

00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:44,223
BECAUSE I LIKE WHAT YOU DO.

00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:46,225
I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S GONNA BE HELPFUL.
I THINK IT IS.

00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,060
I'M VERY FASHION FORWARD.

00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,294
[ LAUGHS ]

00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:51,363
SO, YOU KNOW, AT THE END OF
THE DAY, THAT'S THE ONLY OFFER

00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:53,232
YOU'RE GONNA GET,
'CAUSE EVERYBODY ELSE IS OUT.

00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:55,968
UH...

00:28:58,337 --> 00:29:01,039
YOU KNOW,
THIS IS SOMETHING

00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,977
THAT WE HAVE SCRAPED
AND CLAWED TO DO.

00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:07,246
AND WE'RE BUILDING IT
BRICK BY BRICK,

00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:08,313
AND, YOU KNOW,
FOR US TO GIVE UP

00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:10,315
MORE THAN 15% EQUITY
IN THE COMPANY

00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:12,017
AT THIS STAGE IN THE GAME
IS NOT SOMETHING

00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:13,118
WE'D BE INTERESTED IN,
SO...

00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:15,287
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT GRAVITY'S DONE TO YOU

00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:17,122
HERE TODAY
IN THE SHARK TANK?

00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:19,124
LOOKING AT THE DOLLARS
YOU GENERATE FROM IT

00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:20,225
IN A COMMODITY BUSINESS,

00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:22,261
THERE'S NO WAY
TO GIVE YOU THAT VALUE.

00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:23,996
BUT STICK
TO YOUR GUNS, GUYS.

00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:25,264
I MEAN, THERE -- THERE SHOULD BE
NO DESPERATION IN WHAT YOU DO.

00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:27,466
MARK, BUT DO YOU THINK
I'M BEING UNFAIR?
YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED A LOT.

00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:29,968
YES, YOU'RE BEING UNFAIR.
WHY DON'T YOU COUNTER HIM?

00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:31,236
UM, WE WOULD LIKE TO
COUNTEROFFER YOU

00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:35,040
WITH $200,000 FOR 15%
PLUS A $100,000 LINE OF CREDIT.

00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,209
15%?
CREDIT WOULD ONLY GO -- YES.

00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:38,410
15%?
WOW.

00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,178
THEY CHANGED THE OFFER.

00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:42,080
FOR -- FOR $200,000?
$200,000.

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,350
PLUS $100,000 LINE OF CREDIT
SPECIFICALLY FOR INVENTORY.

00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:49,154
AND THEY'LL THROW IN A
LIFETIME SUPPLY OF FREE CLOTHES.

00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:50,422
YOU GET A LIFETIME SUPPLY
OF FREE CLOTHING.

00:29:50,422 --> 00:29:52,124
[ LAUGHS ]

00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:54,059
I CAN BUY A LOT OF JEANS
FOR $200,000.

00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:55,260
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:59,164
YOU KNOW, GUYS, I PROVIDE
A FACTORY FOR ALL MY COMPANIES.

00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:01,166
WHEN YOU HAVE REAL SALES
AND IT'S WORKING,

00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,401
IT'S NOT HARD
TO FINANCE THAT.

00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:04,002
I DON'T EVEN WORRY
ABOUT THAT.

00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:06,438
I'M STILL STUCK WITH HOW
I EVER GET MY MONEY BACK.

00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:08,106
UNDER THE MODEL
YOU JUST GAVE ME,

00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:13,145
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE
$2 MILLION AFTER TAX.

00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:14,313
KEVIN, ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS
GO DOOR-TO-DOOR,

00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,048
SELL SOME JEANS.
YEAH.

00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:17,215
IN A FAIR MARKET,
IT WON'T TAKE YOU LONG.

00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:19,484
GUYS, LOOK, I-I-I'M --
I'M -- IT'S THE FIRST --

00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,987
ERIK, I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $200,000

00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,022
PLUS $100,000 ON A LINE
OF CREDIT FOR 25%.

00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:26,391
HMM, NOW IT GETS INTERESTING.
AND NOW IT GETS INTERESTING.

00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:28,327
O'Leary: YEAH, I'M NOT GONNA
COMPETE WITH THAT.

00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:30,162
I WOULDN'T
EVEN DO THAT DEAL,

00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:31,463
SO, GUYS, IF YOU DON'T WANT
MY ORIGINAL OFFER, I'M OUT.

00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:35,300
AND SINCE CLEARLY YOU DON'T,
DEAL WITH THAT.

00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,336
YEAH, I'LL GO -- I'LL GO
DOWN TO 25% FROM KEVIN'S.

00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,004
I THINK
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT.

00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:41,173
I DON'T KNOW IF I SEE
THE HUGE FUTURE VISION.

00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:42,274
YOU GOT TO TAKE ME OUT
FOR A BEER

00:30:42,274 --> 00:30:44,009
AND EXPLAIN
HOW WE'RE GETTING CUSTOMERS,

00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:46,278
BUT I THINK
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT.

00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:49,314
UM...

00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:52,351
WOULD YOU CONSIDER --
I WOULDN'T.

00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:55,187
I WOULDN'T CONSIDER
ANYTHING BELOW THAT.
O'Leary: GUYS,
YOU'RE SO FAR FROM --

00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:58,156
YOU NEED -- YOU NEED
$800,000 OF FREE CASH

00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:00,158
TO GET ANYWHERE NEAR
EVEN THAT VALUE.
YEAH, I'M NOT TRYING
TO PUT YOU OVER A BARREL.

00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:01,293
Cuban:
LOOK AT THIS WAY, GUYS --

00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:02,427
LET ME -- LET ME --
LOOK, ROBERT'S A GREAT PARTNER.

00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:03,995
AND I'M GONNA
SELL YOU ON ROBERT

00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:05,230
AND WHY
YOU SHOULD DO THIS DEAL.

00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,299
YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO TURN
YOUR INVENTORY FROM THAT CASH

00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:12,003
SO MANY TIMES AND CREATE SO MUCH
MORE VALUE WITH THAT CASH,

00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:14,106
YOU'LL SWAMP
THE 10% DELTA.

00:31:14,106 --> 00:31:15,307
THAT IS A HELL OF A DEAL.

00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:17,376
THAT IS A HELL OF A DEAL
WITH WHAT YOU'RE AT TODAY.

00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:20,045
YOU MAKE NO MONEY.
YOU'RE AIRBNB'ing YOUR HOUSE.
LET HIM -- LET HIM ANSWER.

00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,214
ROBERT, ROBERT,
WE'RE HUGE FANS,

00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:24,316
AND WE --
WE APPRECIATE YOUR OFFER.

00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:27,119
UM...AT THIS POINT --
IT'S THE RIGHT OFFER, ERIK.

00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,387
A-AT THIS POINT --

00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:30,255
IT'S THE RIGHT OFFER.
DON'T MAKE A MISTAKE.

00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:32,090
BECAUSE -- BECAUSE WE
BELIEVE -- BECAUSE WE
BELIEVE -- AND BECAUSE WE --

00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,291
GUYS, YOU'RE OVERVALUING
THE EQUITY.

00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:35,127
SOMETIMES, CASH IS
MORE VALUABLE THAN EQUITY.

00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:37,195
[ Sarcastically ] OH, REALLY?
LET THE MAN SPEAK.

00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:39,464
LOOK, GUYS, I AM
ALL ABOUT OWNING THE EQUITY

00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:42,167
AS LONG AS YOU CAN.

00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:44,970
BUT SOME BUSINESSES
REQUIRE CASH UP FRONT.

00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,972
$300,000 IS GONNA
GET YOU INVENTORY.

00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:48,073
YOU'RE GONNA TURN IT OVER.

00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:49,274
YOU'RE GONNA GET
TO THAT NEXT STEP.

00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:52,244
STOP AND THINK FOR A MINUTE
IF YOU'RE GONNA WALK OUT OF HERE

00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:55,013
AND YOU'RE GOING TO
SAY TO YOURSELVES,

00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:56,281
"WISH I HAD SAID 'YES.'"

00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:03,088
ROBERT, WE KNOW
THAT WE'RE GONNA GET THERE.

00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:05,991
FOR US, IT'S --
IT'S A MATTER OF WHEN.

00:32:05,991 --> 00:32:08,026
AND FOR US TO GIVE UP --
BUT HOW QUICKLY?

00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:09,294
FOR US TO GIVE UP
THAT MUCH EQUITY...

00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:11,129
YOU MEAN 25%? IS IT 25%?
YOU'RE OVERVALUING
THE EQUITY, GUYS.

00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:12,998
...IS NOT -- IS NOT
IN OUR INTEREST.

00:32:12,998 --> 00:32:15,000
WE COULD DO THE SAME DEAL
FOR 17%.

00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,302
NO, GUYS, NOW WE'RE GETTING
INTO THE REALM OF SILLY.

00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:20,071
AN 8% DELTA
ON SOMETHING THIS NEW?

00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:22,107
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:23,442
THIS IS REALLY
AN INVESTMENT ABOUT YOU GUYS

00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:25,277
AND WHAT YOU'VE BUILT
SO FAR.

00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:30,115
$200,000, 25%,
$100,000 LINE OF CREDIT.

00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:32,984
WE'LL GET THERE QUICKLY
TOGETHER.

00:32:39,224 --> 00:32:41,159
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR
OFFER -- FOR YOUR OFFER, ROBERT.

00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,131
UM,
WE HAVE TO DECLINE.

00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:49,367
[ Scoffing ] OHH.

00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:51,970
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
CONGRATS, GUYS. GOOD LUCK.

00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,138
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
Greiner: GOOD LUCK.

00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:55,974
WE'RE TRYING
TO BUILD SOMETHING

00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,108
THAT WE COULD GIVE
TO OUR CHILDREN.

00:32:57,108 --> 00:33:00,278
GIVING UP 25% 10 MONTHS
INTO THE LIFE OF OUR COMPANY

00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:02,147
IS NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST
OF THE LONG HAUL.

00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:04,049
I REALLY THINK THAT WAS
THE RIGHT OFFER FOR THEM.

00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:06,084
WELCOME TO MY WORLD --
THE WORLD OF DESIGNERS.

00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,085
[ LAUGHS ]
OH, COME ON.

00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:08,153
NO CLUE.

00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:21,266
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS A FORMER NFL PLAYER

00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:25,070
WITH A PRODUCT DESIGNED
TO SUPPORT AND PROTECT.

00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:33,211
HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS BRYAN SCOTT.

00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:37,215
I LIVE IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA,
AND MY COMPANY IS NOENE USA.

00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:40,252
I'M HERE TODAY SEEKING
$100,000

00:33:40,252 --> 00:33:43,288
IN EXCHANGE
FOR 10% OF MY COMPANY.

00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:45,257
NOENE --
THEY'RE HIGH-TECH INSOLES

00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:49,427
THAT ABSORB AND DISPERSE BOTH
LOW- AND HIGH-FREQUENCY SHOCKS

00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:53,398
THAT ENTERS OUR BODIES WHENEVER
WE JUMP, RUN, OR EVEN WALK.

00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:56,134
CURRENTLY, TO TRY
TO ALLEVIATE THIS PROBLEM,

00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:57,402
WE BUY SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

00:33:57,402 --> 00:34:01,339
IT'S SOFT, IT'S CUSHY, AND SO
WE THINK IT'LL FIX OUR PROBLEM.

00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:03,275
BUT IT DOESN'T.
TAKE A LOOK.

00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:05,277
THE BOUNCE OF THE BALL
IS JUST GONNA SHOW

00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:07,445
HOW ENERGY IS
ACTUALLY TRANSFERRED

00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:09,314
BACK UP INTO OUR BODIES

00:34:09,314 --> 00:34:11,283
WITH EACH AND EVERY STEP
THAT WE TAKE.

00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:12,951
IT'S CALLED
THE REBOUND EFFECT,

00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:16,354
AND THAT REBOUND EFFECT CAUSES
CHRONIC PAIN AND INJURY.

00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,256
NOENE, ON THE OTHER HAND,

00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:20,425
IT'S A VISCOELASTIC,
VULCANIZED RUBBER.

00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:23,128
AND IT'S REMARKABLY ABLE

00:34:23,128 --> 00:34:25,230
TO ABSORB AND INTERNALLY
DISPERSE THE SHOCK,

00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:29,234
LEAVING VERY LITTLE
TO NO REBOUND EFFECT.

00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:32,103
SO, WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS
TAKE THIS PIECE OF GLASS.

00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:35,273
I'M GONNA TAKE THE NOENE,
AND I'M GONNA LAY IT ON TOP,

00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:37,142
AND THEN I'M GONNA TAKE
THIS WEIGHTED BOCCIE BALL

00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:38,310
AND DROP IT ON THE NOENE.

00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,978
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:41,413
Greiner: OH, MY GOD.

00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:44,082
NO WAY.
NO WAY.

00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,485
SO, NOTICE...
OOH.

00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:49,454
WOW.
...IT'S NOT DAMAGED.

00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:52,057
BUT WITHOUT THE PROTECTION
OF NOENE...

00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:55,226
Herjavec:
EFFECTIVE PRESENTATION.

00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:58,063
I HAVE ONE OTHER DEMONSTRATION
TO SHOW REALLY QUICK.

00:34:58,063 --> 00:35:01,166
SO, HERE IS
A REGULAR PINK RUBBER BALL,

00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:04,402
AND HERE IS A RUBBER BALL
THAT'S MADE OF NOENE.

00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:06,071
LET'S COMPARE THE DIFFERENCE.

00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,040
OH, THAT'S COOL.

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,308
I HAVE SOME INSOLES
HERE FOR YOU,

00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:15,146
BECAUSE EVERY SHOE AND SNEAKER
NEEDS A PAIR OF NOENE.

00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:20,085
SO, I GUARANTEE YOU OUR PRODUCT
IS THINNER THAN A DIME.
GOT IT.

00:35:20,085 --> 00:35:22,354
I WOULD CHALLENGE YOU
TO FIND ANOTHER PRODUCT

00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:24,055
THAT'S THINNER THAN A DIME

00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:26,424
TO PROTECT THE GLASS
LIKE I JUST DID.

00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:28,426
SO, THESE
THAT I JUST HANDED OUT,

00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:31,429
THESE ARE CALLED
OUR "UNDER INSOLES."

00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:34,032
AND WHAT YOU DO IS
YOU TAKE OUT THE ORIGINAL INSOLE

00:35:34,032 --> 00:35:37,002
OF YOUR SNEAKER,
YOU PUT THIS IN IN YOUR SNEAKER,

00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:38,370
AND THEN YOU PUT
YOUR ORIGINAL INSOLE BACK IN.

00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,404
IT'S SO THIN AND LIGHT,

00:35:39,404 --> 00:35:41,272
IT DOESN'T CHANGE
THE FIT OF YOUR SHOE.

00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:43,408
IN ADDITION
TO THE SUPPORT INSOLE,

00:35:43,408 --> 00:35:45,210
WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO IS
ACTUALLY COME UP

00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,112
WITH OUR
WOMEN'S HEEL VERSION.

00:35:47,112 --> 00:35:48,446
AND THAT'S THE --
THE PROTOTYPE

00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:51,282
WE ARE ACTUALLY IN
THE FINAL STAGES OF FINISHING.

00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:52,450
SO, BRYAN,
HOW DID YOU INVENT THIS?

00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,419
ARE YOU A DOCTOR?
ARE YOU A --
NO.

00:35:54,419 --> 00:35:56,388
I AM NOT A DOCTOR,
AND I AM NOT A SCIENTIST.

00:35:56,388 --> 00:35:58,990
I PLAYED IN THE NFL
FOR 10 YEARS.

00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,425
YOU PLAYED IN THE NFL?
WHAT TEAM?
I DID. YES, I DID.

00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:03,028
I STARTED -- I WAS DRAFTED
TO ATLANTA IN THE SECOND ROUND.

00:36:03,028 --> 00:36:04,396
THREE YEARS THERE,
ONE YEAR IN NEW ORLEANS,

00:36:04,396 --> 00:36:06,097
AND THEN SIX IN BUFFALO.
WOW.

00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:09,401
SO, OUR FIRST QUARTER IS
WE'RE FOCUSING ON INSOLES.

00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:12,303
WHY? BECAUSE IT'S A PRODUCT
THAT SELLS OVER IN EUROPE.

00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:15,306
THE SECOND PHASE IS ACTUALLY
THE DIFFERENT SPORT APPLICATIONS

00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:18,943
SUCH AS BASEBALL-BAT GRIPS,
BOXING GLOVES...
OH.

00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:20,445
...TENNIS RACKETS --
TENNIS ELBOW, GOLF ELBOW,

00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:22,013
ALL OF THAT.

00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,215
TAKE US BACK TO THE --
THE BACKGROUND YOU HAVE

00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:25,417
ON WHY THIS WORKS.

00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:28,420
OKAY, SO, FIRST, NOENE,
IT'S A COMPANY OVER IN EUROPE

00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:31,289
THAT HAS BEEN SELLING
FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME.

00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:32,991
THEY OWN THE PRODUCT?
THEY OWN THE PRODUCT.

00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:34,325
AND DO YOU MIND SHARING
THEIR SALES?

00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,327
THEY BRING IN, ON AVERAGE,
ABOUT $1.2 MILLION ANNUALLY

00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:38,063
ON INSOLES.

00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:40,165
YOU'RE NOT BRINGING US
THE EUROPEAN STUFF, OBVIOUSLY.

00:36:40,165 --> 00:36:42,467
DID YOU GUYS SIGN
A LICENSE WITH THEM?

00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:45,437
YES, SO, WE SIGNED AN EXCLUSIVE
DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT

00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:48,273
TO WHERE WE HAVE
ALL OF THE U.S. AND CANADA

00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:49,274
FOR THE SPORT INSOLES.

00:36:49,274 --> 00:36:52,043
HOW MUCH DO YOU BUY
A UNIT FOR?

00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,044
$6.

00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,145
$6?
OOH, THAT'S EXPENSIVE.

00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:55,180
OHH.

00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,215
$6 FOR A PAIR?

00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,216
YES, $6 FOR A PAIR.
RIGHT.

00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,317
AND HOW MUCH
DO YOU SELL THEM FOR?

00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:00,385
$29.99 IS
WHAT THEY RETAIL FOR.

00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,120
6 BUCKS IS EXPENSIVE.

00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,354
LIKE, IN BETWEEN AN ORTHOTIC...
NO, IT'S EXPENSIVE TO MAKE.

00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,423
BUT $29.99
FOR A RETAIL PRICE...
John: IT'S NOT EXPENSIVE.

00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:07,058
...IS NOT EXPENSIVE.

00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,460
THE NEXT QUESTION
WILL PROVE THAT.

00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,995
HOW MUCH ARE YOUR SALES
THIS LAST YEAR?

00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:13,364
SO, WE PRIDE OUR PRODUCT
ON BEING THINNER THAN A DIME.

00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:16,101
AND TO THIS DAY, CURRENTLY
WE HAVE NOT SOLD A DIME.

00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:18,002
[ LAUGHS ]
AND THE REASON --
AND THE REASON IS --

00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:19,137
[ GROANS ]
THAT'S A GOOD WAY
TO THROUGH TO US, BRYAN.

00:37:19,137 --> 00:37:20,438
ARE YOU KIDDING?

00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:22,240
I SHOULD HAVE PUT
THESE THINGS IN MY EAR

00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,075
TO AVOID THE SHOCK.
YOU KNOW, IN BASKETBALL --

00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,243
YOU KNOW, THE GUY IN BASKETBALL
WHO'S ALWAYS SAYING,

00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,145
"I'M OPEN, I'M OPEN, COACH,"
AND THE COACH SAID,

00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:28,980
"THERE'S A REASON
WHY YOU'RE OPEN, RIGHT?"

00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,982
WELL, WAIT A SECOND.
FIRST, LET ME TAKE A STEP BACK

00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:32,417
AND FIRST EXPLAIN WHY
WE HAVE NOT SOLD ANYTHING YET.

00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,285
WE HAVEN'T TAKEN IT
TO MARKET YET.

00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:36,421
I WAS INTRODUCED
TO THE COMPANY IN JANUARY.

00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,289
SO,
DO YOU OWN EQUITY?

00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:40,358
YES, I DO OWN EQUITY.
THAT'S CORRECT.
HOW MUCH EQUITY DO YOU HAVE?

00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:42,160
SO, THERE'S FOUR OF US,
SO 25%.

00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,329
AND WE'VE COMMITTED
$1 MILLION TO THIS PROJECT,
TO THIS COMPANY.

00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:47,031
YOU'RE NOT COMMITTING
$1 MILLION.

00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:49,200
JUST -- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
IT MAKES NO SENSE.

00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,370
WHY, SIR?
WHY WOULD YOU SPEND
THAT MUCH MONEY?

00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,272
WE EACH HAVE $250,000
TO PUT IN.

00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,374
SO, YOU'RE SAYING THAT --
YOU'RE SAYING THAT RIGHT NOW...
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:58,409
...YOU'VE DEDICATED --
IN CASE THERE'S A CASH CALL,

00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:01,079
YOU HAVE A CASH CALL
UP TO $1 MILLION?

00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:02,380
IF YOU NEED IT.
YES.

00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,983
AND THAT'S WHERE I CAME
WITH THE $1 MILLION VALUATION.

00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:07,185
IT WASN'T OFF OF PROJECTED SALES
OR WHAT WE CAN OR CAN'T DO.
OKAY, NOW WE'VE HEARD
YOUR STORY,

00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:08,419
I CAN TELL YOU
A CERTAINTY.

00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:10,421
BECAUSE OF THE FACT
THAT YOU REALLY HAVE

00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:13,158
NO SALES YET, AT ALL,
THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET...
MM-HMM.

00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:15,260
...A $1 MILLION VALUATION
FOR THIS,

00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:18,029
EVEN IF THE PRODUCT HAS
THE MERITS YOU SUGGEST IT HAS.

00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:19,364
AND ALSO,
THE STRUCTURE OF THIS DEAL

00:38:19,364 --> 00:38:21,099
DOESN'T MAKE
A LOT OF SENSE.

00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:22,967
THE BETTER PLACE
FOR YOU, BRYAN,

00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,303
IS TO ACTUALLY NEGOTIATE
THE LICENSE DEAL WITH THEM

00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,272
AND GET
A SMALL PIECE OF IT.

00:38:27,272 --> 00:38:29,174
NOBODY WANTS TO
START FROM SCRATCH

00:38:29,174 --> 00:38:31,376
AND BUILD A DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM
FOR ONE INSOLE.

00:38:31,376 --> 00:38:33,011
THAT MAKES NO SENSE
WHATSOEVER.

00:38:33,011 --> 00:38:34,345
IT'S NOT JUST ONE INSOLE, KEVIN.
WHAT IS IT?

00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:36,281
WE WOULD LOVE -- WE WOULD
TAKE A LICENSING DEAL.

00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:39,450
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO JUST BE
A DISTRIBUTION COMPANY.

00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,019
YEAH, YOU WANT TO TAKE
ANY REVENUE YOU CAN GET

00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:42,120
AND GET THIS THING GOING,
RIGHT?

00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,288
WE JUST WANT TO GET IT GOING,
AND, HONESTLY --

00:38:43,288 --> 00:38:45,290
BUT IT'S MORE PERSONAL
THAN JUST MONEY TO ME.

00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:48,193
WELL, BRYAN, THE STORY, FOR ME,
JUST DOESN'T ADD UP.

00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:50,295
I -- I'M NOT TRYING TO SAY
THAT YOU DID,

00:38:50,295 --> 00:38:52,130
NECESSARILY, A BAD JOB,
BUT I JUST --

00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,331
I DON'T SEE
THE APPLICATIONS.

00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,399
I'M OUT.

00:38:54,399 --> 00:38:57,035
OOH. ROBERT,
I'M VERY SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

00:38:57,035 --> 00:38:58,069
I'M VERY SORRY
TO HEAR THAT.

00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:00,038
AND I CAN UNDERSTAND
THE SKEPTICISM.

00:39:00,038 --> 00:39:02,974
I CAN'T GET AROUND THE FACT
THAT THE UNIT COST IS $6,

00:39:02,974 --> 00:39:04,142
WHICH MEANS THERE'S
A WHOLE LOT OF WORK.

00:39:04,142 --> 00:39:05,310
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE
AMOUNT OF WORK.

00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,979
IT IS A LOT OF WORK, BUT, KEVIN,
CAN I JUST STAY THIS --

00:39:07,979 --> 00:39:10,381
A WISE COACH ONCE TOLD ME,
"YOU CANNOT CLIMB

00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:13,084
TO THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN
IF THE SIDES ARE SMOOTH."

00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:15,053
NO, I TOTALLY GET ALL THAT.
AND, YES, THERE IS WORK, BUT --

00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:16,287
I WOULD WANT 50%.

00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:17,455
I'D WANT HALF THE COMPANY

00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:19,424
FOR THE AMOUNT OF WORK
AHEAD OF ME.

00:39:19,424 --> 00:39:22,160
SO, I'M OUT.
OKAY. I'M SORRY
TO HEAR THAT, KEVIN.

00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:27,165
Greiner: I THINK
IT'S INTERESTING.

00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:30,001
MM-HMM. OKAY.
I WILL DEFINITELY
BE A TESTER.

00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:32,003
BUT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
FOR SURE...
MM-HMM.

00:39:32,003 --> 00:39:33,404
...FOR THAT REASON
I'M OUT.

00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:34,973
MAN, I'M SORRY
TO HEAR THAT, LORI.

00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:37,308
I WAS HOPING THE WOMEN'S HEELS
THROUGH QVC --

00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:39,344
BRYAN, I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER.

00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:43,014
BUT THERE'S
<i>A LOT</i> OF CONTINGENCIES.

00:39:52,257 --> 00:39:54,092
Narrator:
THREE SHARKS ARE OUT,

00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:55,159
BUT MARK WANTS TO MAKE AN OFFER

00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:59,264
FOR BRYAN'S INSOLE COMPANY,
NOENE.

00:39:59,264 --> 00:40:02,033
IF THE SCIENCE
BEHIND THIS IS LEGIT...
YES.

00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:03,234
...THEN I'M INTERESTED.

00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,369
OKAY.
RIGHT?

00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:06,271
SO, WE'RE GONNA DO
OUR DUE DILIGENCE.
YES.

00:40:06,271 --> 00:40:08,973
BUT I'M GONNA OFFER YOU...
MM-HMM.

00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:11,342
...$100,000 FOR 20%.

00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:13,044
OKAY.

00:40:13,044 --> 00:40:15,213
ONE MORE CONTINGENCY IS YOU GOT
TO CONVINCE THIS GUY TO COME IN

00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:19,050
AS MY PARTNER, BECAUSE
HE OWNS ETONIC BRAND, RIGHT?
OKAY. MM. OKAY.

00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,419
AND I THINK THAT
IF THIS TRULY DOES WORK,

00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:24,322
THEN MAKING IT
AS PART OF A SHOE

00:40:24,322 --> 00:40:26,090
WOULD BE A UNIQUE VALUE ADD...
MM-HMM.

00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,392
AND I WANT TO SEE
IF HE BELIEVES IN THAT.

00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:33,097
AND CUBAN'S RIGHT. WE --
WE PURCHASED THE BRAND ETONIC.
MM-HMM.

00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,301
AND IT'S BEEN THREE YEARS
WITH US WORKING

00:40:36,301 --> 00:40:40,104
ON THE -- THE RUNNING SHOE
BECAUSE, GUYS LIKE ROBERT --

00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,106
YOU GIVE THEM THE WRONG SHOE,
YOU'RE DEAD.

00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,142
THAT'S IT.
I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND.

00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:45,944
SO, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
DAYMOND?

00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:49,047
I'M GONNA GO IN WITH CUBAN
AND GIVE YOU AN OFFER --

00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:52,216
$100,000
FOR 20% ON MY SIDE,

00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:55,153
AND IT SOUNDS LIKE $100,000
FOR 20% --

00:40:55,153 --> 00:40:56,988
OH, SO YOU WANT 40%?
I THOUGHT WE'D JUST SPLIT IT.

00:40:56,988 --> 00:40:58,323
OH, NO. OH, NO.
OKAY.

00:40:58,323 --> 00:41:00,024
THAT'S YOUR CALL.
OOH.

00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:01,225
[ CLEARS THROAT ]

00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:03,027
GOT TO MAKE
A DECISION, THEN.

00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:04,128
I KNOW I WOULD DEFINITELY
GET MY HEAD CUT OFF...

00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:07,065
AND YOU'VE GOT NOTHING
RIGHT NOW. YOU'VE GOT NOTHING.

00:41:07,065 --> 00:41:09,100
...IF I GAVE UP 40%.
WELL, BUT YOU THINK OF IT
LIKE THIS --

00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,335
YOU'RE GETTING TWO SHARKS.

00:41:10,335 --> 00:41:13,237
RIGHT.
ONE WITH AN IMMEDIATE USE
FOR IT.

00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:14,205
MM-HMM.
RIGHT?

00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:15,940
SO, NOW YOU HAVE ME
ON THIS SIDE.

00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,943
I THINK YOU KNOW TONY
FROM ZAPPOS, RIGHT?
YEP. YEP.

00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:21,346
SO, WE HAVE A GOOD AMOUNT
OF RESOURCES.
YEAH, LOOK, I DID WORK
WITH SKECHERS.

00:41:21,346 --> 00:41:24,015
THEY'D BRING US IN
IN A HEARTBEAT.
OH, ROBERT GREENBERG
FROM SKECHERS, AS WELL.

00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:25,049
YEAH, ROBERT, YEAH.

00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:27,051
O'Leary: YOU'VE GOT AN OFFER.
RIGHT.

00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:28,486
YOU'VE GOT $200,000
FOR 40%.

00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,456
EACH SHARK THAT'S INTERESTED
WANTS 20%.

00:41:31,456 --> 00:41:34,058
ON THE OTHER HAND, THESE TWO
ARE THE RIGHT PARTNERS.

00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:35,994
MM-HMM.
WHAT ARE
YOU GOING TO DO?

00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:40,999
YOU CAN COUNTER.
YES, I DEFINITELY
WOULD LOVE TO COUNTER.

00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:45,403
SO, IF BOTH OF YOU WANTED
TO GIVE $100,000 FOR 25%.

00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,175
I LIKED IT AT THE 30%.

00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,277
30% SOUNDS REALLY NICE.
30%, WE GOT IT.

00:41:57,048 --> 00:41:58,149
YOU HAVE A DEAL.

00:41:58,149 --> 00:42:00,251
DONE.
DONE.

00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:01,386
ALL RIGHT.

00:42:01,386 --> 00:42:04,022
[ LAUGHS ] THAT'S RIGHT.
NO, MAN. YOU GOOD. YOU GOOD.

00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:06,190
APPRECIATE YOU, SIR.
APPRECIATE IT.

00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,026
YOU BETTER BE TELLING ME THE
TRUTH, OR I'M COMING AFTER YOU.

00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,227
MY MAN, YOU WILL NOT
BE DISAPPOINTED.

00:42:09,227 --> 00:42:11,062
JUST WAIT
TILL YOU SEE IT.

00:42:11,062 --> 00:42:12,230
AND IF YOU'RE LYING TO ME,
I'M JUST GONNA RUN.

00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,198
[ LAUGHTER ]
Greiner: GOOD LUCK.

00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:17,335
Scott: THE THING THAT HAS
ALWAYS MOTIVATED ME IS

00:42:17,335 --> 00:42:19,170
TO MAKE PEOPLE PROUD.

00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:22,407
AND I WANT BOTH MARK AND DAYMOND
TO SEE, AT THE END OF ALL THIS,

00:42:22,407 --> 00:42:25,176
THAT, "MAN, BRYAN CAME THROUGH.
HE REALLY MADE US PROUD."
