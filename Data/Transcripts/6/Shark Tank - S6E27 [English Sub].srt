00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:01,311
EVERY CAR SOLD
ON EVERY ISLAND IN HAWAII

00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:03,013
IS COMING FROM THAT PLANT.

00:07:03,013 --> 00:07:04,347
IS THAT TRUE?
YES.

00:07:04,347 --> 00:07:06,116
BUT IF SOMEBODY BUILDS A PLANT
IN SAN FRANCISCO

00:07:06,116 --> 00:07:07,284
AND SHIPS A CAR
INTO MY TERRITORY --

00:07:07,284 --> 00:07:10,053
NOT ALLOWED.
CANNOT HAPPEN.

00:07:10,053 --> 00:07:12,222
GUYS, GUYS, I'M GONNA
SIMPLIFY THINGS HERE, RIGHT?

00:07:12,222 --> 00:07:15,225
THE SMART THING, AS AN INVESTOR,
IS TO JUST WATCH WHAT HAPPENS

00:07:15,225 --> 00:07:16,392
WITH TATA MOTORS IN INDIA,

00:07:16,392 --> 00:07:20,095
SEE HOW IT SELLS,
LOOK AT THEIR EXPERIENCE,

00:07:20,095 --> 00:07:23,165
AND THEN, IF IT GOES GOOD, WATCH
SOMEBODY ELSE OPEN UP A PLANT --

00:07:23,165 --> 00:07:25,968
YOU'RE TOO LATE. THIS IS
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.
THIS WAVE IS CRESTING.

00:07:25,968 --> 00:07:28,103
IF IT WAS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW,
YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE.

00:07:28,103 --> 00:07:30,239
YOU'D ALREADY HAVE THE MONEY
AND HAVE THE PLANT OPEN.
NO, IT'S --

00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:31,340
GUYS, I'M OUT.

00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:35,377
THE STRATEGY
OF TRYING TO BUY A LICENSE

00:07:35,377 --> 00:07:38,180
FOR A SINGLE PLANT
IS ALMOST LUDICROUS.

00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,416
IF YOU CAN'T TIE UP
AN ENTIRE REGION,

00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:44,119
YOU'RE BUYING THE RIGHT
TO BECOME A DEALER IN HAWAII.

00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:47,156
YOU'VE GOT TO LOCK UP
ALL OF UNITED STATES.

00:07:47,156 --> 00:07:49,391
DO YOU HAVE $200 MILLION YOU'D
LIKE TO PLOP DOWN FOR THAT?

00:07:49,391 --> 00:07:50,426
YOU BECOME THE PIONEERS.

00:07:50,426 --> 00:07:52,328
YOU ESTABLISH A REGION
FOR $5 MILLION,

00:07:52,328 --> 00:07:53,395
PROVE THE MODEL,

00:07:53,395 --> 00:07:55,331
AND SOMEBODY ELSE SCOOPS
THE REST OF THE COUNTRY.

00:07:55,331 --> 00:07:57,232
THAT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME
AS AN INVESTOR.

00:07:57,232 --> 00:07:58,232
WE WILL BE THE FIRST.

00:07:58,232 --> 00:08:00,068
I GET IT --
BUT NOT THE LAST.

00:08:00,068 --> 00:08:01,402
AND WE HAVE
THE INSIDE CONNECTION TO MDI.

00:08:01,402 --> 00:08:04,005
I CAN GO TO MDI
AND SIMPLY DO A DEAL RIGHT NOW,

00:08:04,005 --> 00:08:05,206
WITHOUT YOU,
FOR NEW YORK.

00:08:05,206 --> 00:08:08,142
WELL, HERE'S MY ANSWER
TO THAT.

00:08:08,142 --> 00:08:10,011
TRY, BECAUSE OUR --

00:08:10,011 --> 00:08:12,180
WHY, 'CAUSE THEY DON'T WANT
MY CAR IN NEW YORK OR MY MONEY?

00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,448
NO, THEY DON'T WANT TO BE
DOUBLE-CROSSED.

00:08:13,448 --> 00:08:15,183
THERE'S A TRUST FACTOR.
OUR COMPANY --

00:08:15,183 --> 00:08:18,119
YOU COULD NOT GO DIRECTLY
TO GUY AND SAY,

00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:20,054
"I'M GONNA PLOP DOWN
$5 MILLION,"

00:08:20,054 --> 00:08:21,956
AND COMPLETELY
DOUBLE-CROSS US.

00:08:21,956 --> 00:08:23,091
Herjavec:
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:26,427
PUSH COMES TO SHOVE,
THEIR COMPANY GETS IN TROUBLE

00:08:26,427 --> 00:08:30,031
AND KEVIN COMES ALONG WITH A
$5 MILLION OFFER FOR THE RIGHTS.

00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:33,201
$5 MILLION, TO GUY,
IS SMALL POTATOES.

00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:36,304
THE WAY TO MAKE THIS WORK
IS TO SIT DOWN

00:08:36,304 --> 00:08:39,207
AND COME UP WITH
A NATIONAL STRATEGY

00:08:39,207 --> 00:08:41,074
FOR THE ENTIRE U.S. MARKET

00:08:41,074 --> 00:08:43,977
AND THEN PACKAGE THAT UP
AND BRING IT TO INVESTORS.

00:08:43,977 --> 00:08:46,146
YOU'RE TRYING TO BUILD A BAKERY
BEFORE TASTING THE CAKE.

00:08:46,146 --> 00:08:49,049
THAT'S RIGHT, BUT WE'RE
GONNA ALLOW OTHERS
TO TASTE THE CAKE.

00:08:49,049 --> 00:08:50,183
THAT'S WHAT
THEY'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.

00:08:50,183 --> 00:08:53,153
I KNOW THE CHALLENGES
OF ALL THE LEGAL ISSUES,

00:08:53,153 --> 00:08:55,389
BRINGING A PRODUCT TO MARKET
LIKE THIS.

00:08:55,389 --> 00:08:58,425
IT COULD TAKE FOREVER,
AND IT'S TOO EARLY FOR ME,

00:08:58,425 --> 00:09:01,428
WITHOUT YOUR ABILITY
TO ACTUALLY GET CLEARANCE

00:09:01,428 --> 00:09:05,999
TO HAVE THIS OPERATE IN AMERICA,
SO BECAUSE OF THAT, I'M OUT.

00:09:09,002 --> 00:09:10,237
YOU KNOW,
I LIKE GREEN PRODUCTS.

00:09:10,237 --> 00:09:13,306
I THINK THAT THIS COMPRESSED-AIR
CONCEPT COULD BE A HERO.

00:09:13,306 --> 00:09:17,344
BUT FOR ME, YOU WOULD
HAVE TO HAVE HAD THE RIGHTS

00:09:17,344 --> 00:09:20,980
TO ALL OF THE U.S.A.
FOR ME TO REALLY BE INTERESTED.

00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,248
I'M OUT.

00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:27,053
YOUR DEAL DOESN'T MAKE A LOT
OF SENSE FOR A SHARK AT ALL,

00:09:27,053 --> 00:09:31,123
BECAUSE THE RETURN EXPECTATIONS
ON THIS ARE FAR IN THE FUTURE.

00:09:31,123 --> 00:09:32,358
IT'S A MONUMENTAL TASK.

00:09:32,358 --> 00:09:35,094
NOBODY WANTS TO LAUNCH THIS
IN HAWAII.

00:09:35,094 --> 00:09:37,430
I'M CERTAINLY NOT GONNA DO IT.
I THINK I'VE ARTICULATED WHY.

00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,065
YEAH.
YOU MAY HAVE A SHARK

00:09:39,065 --> 00:09:41,300
WHO'S SO INGRAINED
IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY.

00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,303
HE MAY BE CRAZY ENOUGH TO DO IT.
WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT RIGHT NOW.

00:09:44,303 --> 00:09:45,371
BUT I'M OUT.

00:09:54,213 --> 00:09:57,083
Narrator:
FOUR SHARKS ARE OUT.

00:09:57,083 --> 00:10:00,252
ROBERT IS PAT AND ETHAN'S
LAST CHANCE FOR A DEAL

00:10:00,252 --> 00:10:03,088
FOR THEIR AIR-PROPELLED VEHICLE,
AIR CAR.

00:10:03,088 --> 00:10:04,422
I'VE INVESTED IN
A LOT OF THINGS,

00:10:04,422 --> 00:10:06,291
AND I'M WILLING TO INVEST
IN THIS, TOO.

00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,393
LOOK, I'M INTERESTED.
I'M -- I'M REALLY INTERESTED.

00:10:08,393 --> 00:10:10,028
AND HE'S FULL OF HOT AIR.

00:10:10,028 --> 00:10:11,096
[ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH!

00:10:11,096 --> 00:10:14,299
IT'S A LOW-COST COMMUTER CAR
FOR $10,000 --

00:10:14,299 --> 00:10:16,167
BIG MARKET FOR THAT.

00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:17,135
MM-HMM.

00:10:17,135 --> 00:10:19,237
THE $5 MILLION
ISN'T THAT MUCH,

00:10:19,237 --> 00:10:21,339
CONSIDERING
THE SIZE OF THIS MARKET.

00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:23,007
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING
YOU'RE GONNA SELL

00:10:23,007 --> 00:10:25,043
ONE STATE AT A TIME,
MY FRIENDS.

00:10:25,043 --> 00:10:27,011
THE MINUTE YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL
IN HAWAII,

00:10:27,011 --> 00:10:29,380
SOMEBODY IS GONNA LOCK UP
THE OTHER STUFF.

00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,183
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE AIR CARS
IN HAWAII.

00:10:32,183 --> 00:10:34,152
I WANT TO BRING THIS
TO THE AMERICAN MARKET.

00:10:34,152 --> 00:10:38,123
I'M HAPPY TO GIVE YOU $5 MILLION
FOR THE RIGHT

00:10:38,123 --> 00:10:41,159
TO GO AND SIT AT
THAT TABLE AND NEGOTIATE

00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:44,261
A DISTRIBUTION DEAL
WITH THE PEOPLE WHO OWN IT.

00:10:44,261 --> 00:10:47,264
SO I'M GIVING YOU
$5 MILLION FOR 50%,

00:10:47,264 --> 00:10:51,268
CONTINGENT ON BEING ABLE TO
NEGOTIATE AN AMERICAN-WIDE DEAL.

00:10:51,268 --> 00:10:53,270
AND IF YOU DON'T GET
THAT DEAL...

00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,105
WELL, IT'S CONTINGENT ON THAT,
'CAUSE I DON'T BUY --

00:10:55,105 --> 00:10:57,040
THEN IT'S --
THE $5 MILLION GOES AWAY.

00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,443
GUY NEGRE
WOULD BE THRILLED

00:10:59,443 --> 00:11:02,379
TO HAVE YOU MAKE A DEAL
WITH HIM,

00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:06,416
AND I FEEL VERY CERTAIN THAT
THAT NUMBER COULD COME DOWN,

00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,052
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY,
HAVING THE U.S. RIGHTS

00:11:09,052 --> 00:11:10,954
IS THE GOLDEN GOOSE.
RIGHT.

00:11:10,954 --> 00:11:12,189
WHY ARE YOU EVEN
HESITATING?

00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:13,357
WELL, I --
WE'RE NOT.

00:11:13,357 --> 00:11:16,059
I WANT TO ADD ONE OTHER FILL-UP
THAT YOU WOULD BE PURCHASING,

00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:17,227
AND THAT IS
THE GOLF CART.

00:11:17,227 --> 00:11:18,362
PAT,
YOU GOT TO STOP SELLING

00:11:18,362 --> 00:11:20,297
Cuban: PAT, DON'T TALK YOURSELF
OUT OF A DEAL.

00:11:20,297 --> 00:11:22,099
YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE
A DECISION.

00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:25,335
Greiner:
DOES THAT MEAN YES?

00:11:25,335 --> 00:11:26,302
WE HAVE A DEAL!

00:11:26,302 --> 00:11:28,070
OH, MY GOSH! YEAH!
[ LAUGHS ]

00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:30,106
WHAT AN HONOR
TO MEET YOU, PAT.

00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,407
THANK YOU.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:33,075
YOU ARE THE PERFECT,
PERFECT PERSON.

00:11:33,075 --> 00:11:34,443
I AM THE PERFECT PERSON
FOR THIS. I LOVE CARS.

00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,279
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
ALL RIGHT. GOOD LUCK.

00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:39,081
Cuban: CONGRATS.
Greiner: THANK YOU GUYS.
Herjavec: THANK YOU.

00:11:39,081 --> 00:11:42,351
Tucker: WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH
THE REINVENTION OF THE MOTOR,

00:11:42,351 --> 00:11:45,021
THAT LEAP OF FAITH
IS THE LEAP

00:11:45,021 --> 00:11:48,291
THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE ON
THE GROUND FLOOR HAVE TO TAKE.

00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,992
MM-HMM.

00:11:49,992 --> 00:11:52,228
AND WE'VE BEEN PROVEN RIGHT
FOR OUR -- FOR TAKING THE JUMP.

00:11:52,228 --> 00:11:53,963
HIGH FIVE, ROBERT.

00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,097
I LIKE THAT.
AWESOME.

00:11:55,097 --> 00:11:57,133
THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING THERE.
I HOPE THERE IS.

00:12:02,205 --> 00:12:04,440
Narrator: EARLIER THIS SEASON,
WE SAW CHEF HEIDI LOVIG

00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,342
MAKE A DEAL WITH LORI GREINER

00:12:06,342 --> 00:12:09,010
FOR HER VEGAN-CHEESE COMPANY,
HEIDI HO.

00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,245
Lovig:
WE'RE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE

00:12:10,245 --> 00:12:12,113
IN FOUR REGIONS
OF WHOLE FOODS MARKET.

00:12:12,113 --> 00:12:13,315
I HAVE ALREADY SECURED GROWTH

00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,283
INTO FIVE MORE REGIONS
WITH THEM,

00:12:15,283 --> 00:12:19,120
AND I NEED WORKING CAPITAL
TO EXECUTE AGAINST THAT GROWTH.

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,056
Narrator:
LET'S SEE WHAT SHE'S UP TO NOW.

00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,260
OH, MY GOSH,
BUSINESS HAS EXPLODED

00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,062
SINCE BEING ON "SHARK TANK."

00:12:27,062 --> 00:12:30,065
IN THE 12 MONTHS
LEADING UP TO "SHARK TANK,"

00:12:30,065 --> 00:12:33,235
OUR SALES WERE $140,000.

00:12:33,235 --> 00:12:37,072
IT'S ONLY BEEN FOUR MONTHS
SINCE BEING ON "SHARK TANK,"

00:12:37,072 --> 00:12:39,441
AND OUR SALES ARE $750,000.

00:12:39,441 --> 00:12:41,042
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY
SOME CHEESE?

00:12:41,042 --> 00:12:44,179
TODAY, I AM IN CHICAGO
DOING AN IN-STORE DEMO,

00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:47,115
BECAUSE THEY REALLY ALLOW ME
TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC

00:12:47,115 --> 00:12:49,283
ABOUT OUR DELICIOUS
PLANT-BASED CHEESES.

00:12:49,283 --> 00:12:51,185
I'D LIKE TO TRY
SOME CHEESE.

00:12:51,185 --> 00:12:52,286
LORI!
[ LAUGHS ]

00:12:52,286 --> 00:12:53,220
COME HERE!

00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,388
HI!

00:12:54,388 --> 00:12:57,124
Greiner: YOU KNOW WHAT'S GREAT
ABOUT HEIDI?

00:12:57,124 --> 00:12:59,026
SHE'S SOCIALLY CONSCIOUS,
SHE'S HARDWORKING,

00:12:59,026 --> 00:13:03,163
SHE'S SO TENACIOUS,
AND THE PRODUCT IS AMAZING.

00:13:03,163 --> 00:13:04,231
SHE MAKES IT WITH LOVE.

00:13:04,231 --> 00:13:06,333
I'M SO GLAD
THAT WE GOT INTO

00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:09,203
OVER 300 WHOLE FOODS STORES
LIKE THAT.

00:13:09,203 --> 00:13:13,040
IT'S REALLY NOT EASY TO BUILD
A BRAND AND A NAME FOR YOURSELF

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,009
IN THE NATURAL-FOOD INDUSTRY
WITH A PRODUCT

00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:17,211
THAT'S SO UNIQUE
AND SO NEW TO SO MANY PEOPLE.

00:13:17,211 --> 00:13:19,313
IT'S REALLY GOOD.
REALLY GOOD, RIGHT?

00:13:19,313 --> 00:13:23,417
LORI WAS THE SHARK THAT CAME IN
WHEN WE WERE SUPER VULNERABLE

00:13:23,417 --> 00:13:25,052
AND TOOK A RISK ON US.

00:13:25,052 --> 00:13:27,121
I LOVE HEIDI HO,
AND YOU'RE DOING AMAZING.

00:13:27,121 --> 00:13:29,990
TOGETHER,
I KNOW WE WILL BECOME

00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,291
THE NEXT BIG NAME
IN NATURAL FOOD.

00:13:42,335 --> 00:13:44,370
HI. I'M SHAUNA SLEDGE
FROM FORT COLLINS, COLORADO.

00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,105
I LIVE WITH MY HUSBAND, TODD,

00:13:46,105 --> 00:13:47,340
OUR TWO GIRLS,
STEPHANIE AND MEGHAN,

00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,075
AND OUR LITTLE BOY, SKYLAR.

00:13:49,075 --> 00:13:50,009
SO, I'M A WORKING MOM.

00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:51,110
YOUR GUMS FEEL OKAY?

00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,046
I'M A PART-TIME
DENTAL HYGIENIST.

00:13:53,046 --> 00:13:54,047
COME ON!

00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,081
I'M A GROUP-FITNESS
INSTRUCTOR.

00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:56,182
GOOD JOB!

00:13:56,182 --> 00:13:57,984
AND I HAVE MY OWN BUSINESS
THAT I RUN.

00:13:59,118 --> 00:14:00,987
LIVING A HEALTHY
AND ACTIVE LIFESTYLE

00:14:00,987 --> 00:14:03,056
HAS ALWAYS BEEN
REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME.

00:14:03,056 --> 00:14:05,958
A BIG PART OF BEING HEALTHY
IS WHAT YOU EAT,

00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,027
AND I'M A TRUE BELIEVER
IN THE PALEO DIET.

00:14:08,027 --> 00:14:09,195
ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
LET'S DIG IN.

00:14:09,195 --> 00:14:12,331
THE PALEO DIET MIMICS THE DIET
OF OUR ANCIENT ANCESTORS.

00:14:12,331 --> 00:14:14,399
IT CONSISTS OF EATING
LEAN PROTEIN,

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,203
AVOIDING DAIRY, POTATOES,
LEGUMES, AND PROCESSED FOODS.

00:14:18,203 --> 00:14:20,439
BASICALLY, IF THE CAVEMAN
DIDN'T HAVE IT, DON'T EAT IT.

00:14:20,439 --> 00:14:22,441
WE WILL BE SHIPPING IT OUT
IN TWO DAYS.

00:14:22,441 --> 00:14:25,143
WE'RE IN AN EXTREMELY
COMPETITIVE MARKET.

00:14:25,143 --> 00:14:27,979

NOT TO DO ANOTHER THING.

OF THE PROBLEM,

I DIDN'T LIKE THE BARS.

THAT TO CATCH BIG FISH,

ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS FISHERMEN

TO MAKE A DEAL.

00:35:17,831 --> 00:35:20,734
YOU CAME HERE TO MAKE A DEAL,
BUT 3.5% --
WE WANT TO MAKE A DEAL.

00:35:20,734 --> 00:35:21,835
WELL, LET'S TALK.

00:35:21,835 --> 00:35:24,572
I MEAN, WE'RE VERY, VERY HAPPY
TO TALK. WE CAME HERE --

00:35:24,572 --> 00:35:25,606
LET ME TRY TO --

00:35:25,606 --> 00:35:26,840
WAIT, BUT WHAT
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,709
'CAUSE YOU GOT TO UNDERSTAND
ONE THING.

00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:32,513
AND MAYBE THE OTHER GUYS FEEL
A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

00:35:32,513 --> 00:35:35,683
THAT FLOOR RIGHT THERE IS FOR
PEOPLE THAT DESPERATELY NEED

00:35:35,683 --> 00:35:36,784
A SHOT AND ACCESS
TO CAPITAL.

00:35:36,784 --> 00:35:38,786
THEY'RE NOT SOMEBODY
THAT RAISED A MILLION DOLLARS,

00:35:38,786 --> 00:35:40,453
DIDN'T EVEN
LAUNCH SOMETHING.

00:35:40,453 --> 00:35:42,422
LET ME ASK
SOME QUESTIONS NOW.

00:35:42,422 --> 00:35:43,790
I WANT TO HEAR THIS!
LET THEM ANSWER IT.

00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,558
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET
THE WRONG IMPRESSION.

00:35:45,558 --> 00:35:47,427
I'M FROM
A SMALL TOWN IN IDAHO.

00:35:47,427 --> 00:35:49,429
I'VE TRIED TO LAUNCH
OTHER COMPANIES

00:35:49,429 --> 00:35:50,496
AND LIVED IN MY CAR.

00:35:50,496 --> 00:35:52,565
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
I'VE BEEN THERE.

00:35:52,565 --> 00:35:54,534
WHAT DOES THAT
HAVE TO DO WITH

00:35:54,534 --> 00:35:56,469
YOU VALUING THE COMPANY
OVER $4 MILLION?
LET ME ASK
SOME QUESTIONS.

00:35:56,469 --> 00:35:57,737
WELL, MARK,
I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU,

00:35:57,737 --> 00:35:58,705
BUT IT BOTHERS ME, TOO.

00:35:58,705 --> 00:36:00,406
I DON'T UNDERSTAND --

00:36:00,406 --> 00:36:02,709
YOU HAVEN'T REALLY SOLD
OR HAD EXPERIENCE

00:36:02,709 --> 00:36:04,611
WITH THIS PRODUCT WHATSOEVER.

00:36:04,611 --> 00:36:06,813
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOUR RETURN RATE'S GONNA BE.

00:36:06,813 --> 00:36:09,549
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW WELL
THE QUALITY IS GONNA HOLD UP.

00:36:09,549 --> 00:36:11,517
YOU DON'T KNOW
A LOT OF THINGS.

00:36:11,517 --> 00:36:13,586
AND YOU DO COME IN HERE
VALUING IT

00:36:13,586 --> 00:36:16,389
AT A RIDICULOUS AMOUNT,
FOR HAVING NO EXPERIENCE.

00:36:16,389 --> 00:36:17,457
I HATE WHEN I HEAR THIS
FROM THE OTHER SHARKS.

00:36:17,457 --> 00:36:18,458
I JUST HATE IT,
HATE IT, HATE IT.

00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:21,426
THIS IS NOT ONLY
FOR THE DESPERATE.

00:36:21,426 --> 00:36:23,395
IF SOMEONE HAS A GOOD IDEA AND
COME IN HERE AND SELL US ON IT

00:36:23,395 --> 00:36:24,630
THEY CAN GET
AN INVESTOR...
NO, BUT, MARK, WE DON'T
HAVE TO AGREE WITH YOU.

00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,431
...JUST LIKE THEY WENT
TO OTHER INVESTORS.

00:36:26,431 --> 00:36:29,401
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING, AND
I DON'T HAVE TO AGREE WITH YOU.

00:36:29,401 --> 00:36:30,569
I DON'T AGREE
WITH YOU.

00:36:30,569 --> 00:36:33,438
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU COME IN ASKING FOR THAT

00:36:33,438 --> 00:36:35,707
WHEN YOU HAVE
JUST NO EXPERIENCE WITH IT YET.

00:36:35,707 --> 00:36:37,643
WE DON'T HAVE
SOMEBODY ON OUR TEAM

00:36:37,643 --> 00:36:39,678
AS AN INVESTOR
THAT CAN BUILD A BRAND.

00:36:39,678 --> 00:36:40,779
THAT'S TRUE.

00:36:40,779 --> 00:36:44,716
WE NEED TO BECOME A BRAND.
WE WANT TO GO INTERNATIONAL.

00:36:44,716 --> 00:36:46,385
I DON'T SEE
PROOF OF CONCEPT.

00:36:46,385 --> 00:36:47,419
WHAT IS YOUR
CUSTOMER-ACQUISITION COST

00:36:47,419 --> 00:36:48,587
GOING TO BE,
DO YOU ANTICIPATE?

00:36:48,587 --> 00:36:52,591
IN THE STARTUP STAGE FOR TYPICAL
E-COMMERCE GLASSES COMPANIES,

00:36:52,591 --> 00:36:53,659
IT'S $5 TO $15.

00:36:53,659 --> 00:36:55,527
WHEN THEY MOVE INTO
THE GROWTH STAGE,

00:36:55,527 --> 00:36:56,762
IT'S CLOSER
TO $20 TO $30.

00:36:56,762 --> 00:36:59,464
OKAY, SO, LET'S TAKE
THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO.

00:36:59,464 --> 00:37:02,600
DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH RUNWAY CASH
TO STAY ALIVE FOR 24 MONTHS,

00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,868
IF IT'S A $25
CUSTOMER-ACQUISITION COST?

00:37:03,868 --> 00:37:05,836
YEAH, WHAT'S YOUR CASH-TO-DEBT
RIGHT NOW?

00:37:05,836 --> 00:37:08,706
SO, OUR BURN RATE'S
ROUGHLY $38,000 A MONTH.

00:37:08,706 --> 00:37:09,807
MOST OF IT GOES TO SALARY.

00:37:09,807 --> 00:37:11,742
THAT'S PRETTY LEAN.
THAT'S PRETTY LEAN.

00:37:11,742 --> 00:37:14,578
MY CHALLENGE IS, WE ALL UP HERE
HAVE DIFFERENT FUNDAMENTALS

00:37:14,578 --> 00:37:16,580
IN WHAT WE BELIEVE
IN BUSINESS.

00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,649
I'M A GUY WHO BELIEVES
THAT YOU SHOULD SHOW

00:37:18,649 --> 00:37:21,552
THAT YOU HAVE PROOF OF CONCEPT,
THEN YOU BUILD A BUSINESS,

00:37:21,552 --> 00:37:25,656
AND YOU BRING IN INVESTORS ONCE
YOU PROVE THAT THE MODEL WORKS

00:37:25,656 --> 00:37:27,425
AND YOU CAN RETURN MONEY.

00:37:27,425 --> 00:37:29,593
I DON'T KNOW IF
YOU'RE FULL OF B.S. OR NOT,

00:37:29,593 --> 00:37:31,429
SO I DON'T WANT
TO CHOP YOU DOWN.

00:37:31,429 --> 00:37:34,565
I JUST HAVE
A VERY FUNNY FEELING

00:37:34,565 --> 00:37:36,701
THAT YOU'RE NOT THE RIGHT PERSON
FOR ME.

00:37:36,701 --> 00:37:38,703
AND TO SUM IT ALL UP,
I'M OUT.

00:37:38,703 --> 00:37:40,538
OKAY.
WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:37:40,538 --> 00:37:42,640
I REALLY APOLOGIZE
THAT YOU FEEL THAT WAY.

00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,874
KEVIN -- KEVIN, IS IT TRUE
THAT YOU'RE A SILENT PARTNER?

00:37:44,874 --> 00:37:46,543
YOU HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING.

00:37:46,543 --> 00:37:47,644
Habich: NO.
[ LAUGHS ]

00:37:47,644 --> 00:37:49,546
I'M JUST NOT
THE FINANCIAL GUY.
OKAY.

00:37:49,546 --> 00:37:51,614
AND IT'S ALL
VALUATION QUESTIONS.
I GET IT.

00:37:51,614 --> 00:37:54,384
LET ME JUST JUMP IN
FOR A MINUTE.

00:37:54,384 --> 00:37:57,787
I THINK THE GLASSES LOOK GREAT
AND THE QUALITY'S NICE.

00:37:57,787 --> 00:37:59,622
THE PROBLEM, FOR ME, IS

00:37:59,622 --> 00:38:02,759
WHEN YOU HAVE A PRODUCT,
TRY IT, TEST IT, SEE,

00:38:02,759 --> 00:38:04,794
BEFORE YOU START RAISING
ALL SORTS OF MONEY.

00:38:04,794 --> 00:38:08,631
SO FOR ME, I DON'T THINK I HAVE
THE SAME PHILOSOPHY AS YOU,

00:38:08,631 --> 00:38:10,734
AND FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.

00:38:10,734 --> 00:38:14,637
WELL, THANK YOU.

00:38:14,637 --> 00:38:16,873
KONRAD, I DON'T HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH BIG BETS.

00:38:16,873 --> 00:38:19,776
I MEAN,
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DESIGN.

00:38:19,776 --> 00:38:21,444
IT LOOKS GREAT.
I APPRECIATE IT.

00:38:21,444 --> 00:38:22,779
I MEAN, IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S WORTH
THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

00:38:22,779 --> 00:38:24,414
YOU'RE SELLING IT FOR.

00:38:24,414 --> 00:38:28,817
MY ONLY ISSUE IS I WISH YOU HAD
A LITTLE MORE EXPERIENCE.

00:38:28,817 --> 00:38:30,452
I'M NOT FAULTING YOU
FOR IT,

00:38:30,452 --> 00:38:31,587
'CAUSE YOU GOT TO START
SOMEWHERE, RIGHT?

00:38:31,587 --> 00:38:34,356
YOU'RE ONLY
A FIRST-TIME C.E.O. ONCE.
RIGHT.

00:38:34,356 --> 00:38:36,558
AND IT'S JUST
THAT LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY --

00:38:36,558 --> 00:38:38,794
NOT A NEGATIVE,
JUST THAT'S HOW I FEEL.

00:38:38,794 --> 00:38:39,828
SO...

00:38:39,828 --> 00:38:41,797
I'M GONNA BE OUT.

00:38:41,797 --> 00:38:44,466
I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND.

00:38:48,403 --> 00:38:50,706
FIRST OF ALL,
I DON'T CARE WHERE VALUATION IS.

00:38:50,706 --> 00:38:52,708
I CARE ABOUT
WHERE VALUATION CAN GO.

00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:53,776
MM-HMM.

00:38:53,776 --> 00:38:55,511
AND YOU MENTIONED TO KEVIN
THAT THERE WAS

00:38:55,511 --> 00:38:58,714
A $25 CUSTOMER-ACQUISITION COST
THAT YOU ESTIMATE.

00:38:58,714 --> 00:39:02,351
SO, HOW ARE YOU SPENDING
THAT $25?

00:39:02,351 --> 00:39:03,752
RIGHT NOW, WE'RE NOT.

00:39:03,752 --> 00:39:06,421
OUR GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY'S
REALLY BASED AROUND THREE AREAS.

00:39:06,421 --> 00:39:07,822
IT'S AROUND, YOU KNOW,
BUILDING AWARENESS --

00:39:07,822 --> 00:39:09,657
HOW ARE YOU GONNA
BUILD AWARENESS?

00:39:09,657 --> 00:39:12,393
WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH
AN AWESOME FASHION P.R. AGENCY,

00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:15,863
AN E-COMMERCE P.R. AGENCY, IN
NEW YORK, TO PREPARE FOR LAUNCH.

00:39:15,863 --> 00:39:18,733
SO, BUT -- OKAY, SO, YOU'RE
GONNA GET YOUR BLAST OF P.R.

00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:20,468
YEP.
THEN WHAT?

00:39:20,468 --> 00:39:23,638
OUR PRODUCT --
'CAUSE IT'S NOT
AN INHERENTLY VIRAL PRODUCT.

00:39:23,638 --> 00:39:25,373
IT'S DESIGNED TO SHARE,
RIGHT?

00:39:25,373 --> 00:39:27,608
IF YOU AND YOUR FRIEND
BOTH HAVE TITLE FRAMES,

00:39:27,608 --> 00:39:29,377
YOU CAN ACTUALLY
SWAP YOUR FRAMES.

00:39:29,377 --> 00:39:31,379
IN ADDITION,
THERE'S THIS --

00:39:31,379 --> 00:39:33,414
THAT'S A STRETCH.
[ LAUGHS ]

00:39:33,414 --> 00:39:35,383
IT'S A NICE TRY,
BUT IT'S A STRETCH.

00:39:35,383 --> 00:39:36,851
AND I THINK -- I THINK --
I THINK THE REAL KEY
IS THAT THERE'S --

00:39:36,851 --> 00:39:38,619
LOOK IN THE MARKET,
ALL RIGHT?

00:39:38,619 --> 00:39:40,788
YOU SEE EVERYBODY SELLING
THE EXACT SAME PRODUCT.

00:39:40,788 --> 00:39:42,557
BUT YOU HAVEN'T
EXPLAINED TO ME

00:39:42,557 --> 00:39:44,659
HOW YOU'RE GONNA CONVEY THAT
TO A POTENTIAL BUYER,

00:39:44,659 --> 00:39:47,528
OTHER THAN SWAPPING LENSES,
IF SOMEONE ALREADY HAS IT.

00:39:47,528 --> 00:39:49,796
SO PRODUCT, GREAT.
MM-HMM.

00:39:49,796 --> 00:39:51,865
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF BEAUTIFUL
PRODUCTS THAT HAVE DIED.

00:39:51,865 --> 00:39:54,568
THE FACT THAT
I DON'T SEE YOU AS HAVING

00:39:54,568 --> 00:39:57,571
A VERY SPECIFIC GO-TO-MARKET
STRATEGY BEYOND P.R.,

00:39:57,571 --> 00:39:58,839
THAT REALLY CONCERNS ME.

00:39:58,839 --> 00:40:02,475
IT LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT
YOU'RE AMAZING PRODUCT GUYS

00:40:02,475 --> 00:40:04,744
BUT DON'T HAVE
THAT OTHER PART FIGURED OUT.

00:40:04,744 --> 00:40:06,613
FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.

00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:08,782
SURE.

00:40:08,782 --> 00:40:10,717
AND THEN THERE WAS ONE.

00:40:10,717 --> 00:40:14,754
I'M VERY VALUABLE TO YOU
FOR TWO REASONS.

00:40:14,754 --> 00:40:17,424
ONE,
I'M THE ONLY SHARK LEFT.

00:40:17,424 --> 00:40:18,525
[ CHUCKLES ]
OKAY?

00:40:18,525 --> 00:40:19,793
[ CHUCKLES ]
THAT'S USUALLY
THE ONLY REASON.

00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:21,661
AND, TWO,
YOU'RE THE ONLY SHARK LEFT.

00:40:21,661 --> 00:40:23,730
O'Leary: SECONDLY, MY COMPANIES
GET A LOT OF MEDIA,

00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:26,733
BECAUSE I'M A MEDIA WHORE.

00:40:26,733 --> 00:40:29,469
IT'S WHAT I DO.
I'M VERY GOOD AT IT.

00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:32,471
AND WHAT I THINK I CAN DO,
OR HELP YOU WITH,

00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:35,374
IS REDUCE YOUR
CUSTOMER-ACQUISITION COSTS.

00:40:35,374 --> 00:40:37,476
IF I CAN MAKE THEM ZERO,
YOU LAST A LOT LONGER.

00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,644
YEAH, WE WOULD LAST
A VERY LONG TIME.

00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:39,812
SO HERE'S THE DEAL
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU.

00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:43,716
I'LL GIVE YOU $150,000
AS A LOAN.

00:40:43,716 --> 00:40:45,584
HERE'S HOW
YOU'RE GONNA PAY ME BACK.

00:40:45,584 --> 00:40:46,819
EVERY TIME YOU SELL
ONE OF THESE BOX SETS,

00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:52,725
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME $25
UNTIL I'VE RECOUPED $450,000.

00:40:52,725 --> 00:40:56,528
THEN THE LOAN GOES AWAY.
BUT THERE'S ONE OTHER THING.

00:40:56,528 --> 00:40:58,697
YOU'RE GIVING ME
THAT 3.5% EQUITY,

00:40:58,697 --> 00:41:01,667
JUST BECAUSE
I'M MR. WONDERFUL.

00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:04,670
I THINK YOU'VE DONE A HECK
OF A GOOD JOB GETTING HERE.

00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,705
I LIKE THE PRODUCT.

00:41:06,705 --> 00:41:09,742
BUT YOU ARE IN
A BRUTALLY COMPETITIVE SPACE.

00:41:09,742 --> 00:41:12,377
THAT'S MY OFFER.
IT'S THE ONLY ONE.

00:41:12,377 --> 00:41:13,745
NO, I DON'T WANT
A COUNTER.

00:41:13,745 --> 00:41:16,347
THAT'S FINE.

00:41:16,347 --> 00:41:21,486
RIGHT NOW,
I'M JUST IN THE START-UP STAGE.

00:41:21,486 --> 00:41:23,488
ANY ROYALTIES
IS VERY, VERY DIFFICULT.

00:41:23,488 --> 00:41:24,722
YOU'RE NOT IN
THE START-UP STAGE.

00:41:24,722 --> 00:41:25,823
YOU'RE ON THE TRACK.

00:41:25,823 --> 00:41:28,793
SURE. UM...

00:41:28,793 --> 00:41:30,561
YOU KNOW, UNFORTUNATELY,

00:41:30,561 --> 00:41:32,497
I DON'T THINK IT'S AN OFFER
THAT WE CAN TAKE AT THIS TIME.

00:41:32,497 --> 00:41:34,856
YOU'RE DEAD TO ME.
I'M OUT.

00:41:34,856 --> 00:41:36,891
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU GUYS.
Cuban: GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
CONGRATULATIONS.

00:41:36,891 --> 00:41:38,860
Billetz:
THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH.
IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT.

00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,895
Greiner: BYE.
THANK YOU GUYS.
HAVE A GREAT DAY.

00:41:42,464 --> 00:41:45,667
IT'S DISAPPOINTING,
I THINK, FOR BOTH OF US,

00:41:45,667 --> 00:41:49,637
TO NOT HAVE A DEAL, BUT WE'RE
GONNA KEEP PUSHING FORWARD,

00:41:49,637 --> 00:41:53,441
AND WE'RE GONNA TAKE OUR DREAM
AND MAKE IT A REALITY.

00:41:53,441 --> 00:41:54,609
THIS ISN'T THE FIRST "NO"
WE'VE HEARD.

00:41:54,609 --> 00:41:56,211
NO, IT'S NOT THE FIR--
WON'T BE THE LAST.
