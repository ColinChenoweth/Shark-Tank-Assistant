00:00:01,068 --> 00:00:02,302
Narrator: TONIGHT,

00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:04,304
SPECIAL GUEST SHARK BILLIONAIRE

00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:06,206
NICK WOODMAN,
RETURNS TO THE TANK.

00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:07,975
I THINK THIS IS AWESOME.

00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,076
Narrator: IN THE TANK,

00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:10,410
ENTREPRENEURS SEEK AN INVESTMENT

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,980
TO START, GROW,
OR SAVE THEIR BUSINESS.

00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:13,413
OH. OH, YEAH.

00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:15,115
SWEET!

00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:17,017
Narrator: IF THE SHARKS
HEAR A GREAT IDEA...

00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,385
YOU HAVE GOT SOMETHING HERE.

00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:20,053
[ CAT MEOWS ]

00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:21,455
Narrator: ...THEY'LL INVEST
THEIR OWN MONEY...

00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:23,290
THIS IS LIKE
THE ULTIMATE TOY TO ME.

00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,025
Narrator: ...AND FIGHT
EACH OTHER FOR A DEAL.

00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,260
OH, COME ON!

00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,362
THIS WILL GO GREAT ON QVC.

00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:29,363
OH, MY GOD!

00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,098
Narrator:
BUT THE ENTREPRENEURS

00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:33,033
MUST GET THE FULL AMOUNT
THEY'RE ASKING FOR,

00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,102
OR THEY'LL WALK AWAY
WITH NOTHING.

00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:36,336
JUST LIKE THAT, BOOM!

00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:40,107
O'Leary: I CAN'T DECIDE IF
THIS IS NUT BAR FACTOR 6.2

00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:41,441
OR YOU HAVE SOMETHING HERE.

00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:44,978
SO DISAPPOINTED IN YOU
RIGHT NOW!

00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:46,413
Narrator:
WHO ARE THE SHARKS?

00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:54,021
THEY'RE SELF-MADE
BUSINESS EXPERTS WORTH BILLIONS.

00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:56,356
KEVIN O'LEARY
IS A SHREWD VENTURE CAPITALIST

00:00:56,356 --> 00:01:00,127
WHO MADE HIS FORTUNE SELLING A
CHILDREN'S EDUCATIONAL COMPANY

00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:02,162
FOR OVER $4 BILLION.

00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:06,300
DAYMOND JOHN DOMINATED
THE FASHION WORLD WITH FUBU.

00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,003
NOW HE'S THE BRANDING EXPERT
BEHIND MULTIPLE GLOBAL BRANDS

00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:11,371
GENERATING BILLIONS IN SALES.

00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:15,175
LORI GREINER, THE QUEEN OF QVC,
HOLDS OVER 100 PATENTS

00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:17,411
AND HAS LAUNCHED
OVER 400 PRODUCTS,

00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:21,048
GROSSING OVER A HALF A BILLION
DOLLARS IN SALES.

00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:24,151
MARK CUBAN, RENOWNED
BILLIONAIRE TECH MOGUL

00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:27,354
AND THE OUTSPOKEN OWNER
OF THE DALLAS MAVERICKS.

00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:31,124
AND NICK WOODMAN,
CREATOR OF THE GoPro CAMERA,

00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:34,227
TURNED HIS PRODUCT INTO
A CONSUMER AND MEDIA EMPIRE

00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:37,230
WORTH MORE THAN $8 BILLION.

00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:46,974
FIRST INTO THE TANK
IS A REIMAGINATION

00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:49,343
OF A 5,000-YEAR-OLD INVENTION.

00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,352
HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS DAVID PATRICK,

00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:01,288
AND THIS IS MY BUSINESS PARTNER,
ZACK FLEISHMAN,

00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,457
AND WE'RE HERE TODAY
SEEKING $100,000

00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,293
IN EXCHANGE FOR 5% OF
OUR COMPANY, SHARK WHEEL.

00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:07,394
THIS IS THE WHEEL,

00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:10,263
AND IT'S BEEN AROUND
FOR OVER 5,000 YEARS.

00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:12,065
BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,267
THE CURRENT WHEEL
HAS MANY LIMITATIONS.

00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:17,104
FOR EXAMPLE,
THIN WHEELS ARE FAST,

00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:20,107
BUT THEY DON'T GRIP WELL,
AND WIDE WHEELS GRIP,

00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:21,441
BUT THEY'RE SLOW AND HEAVY.

00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:25,012
WHY CAN'T WE HAVE ONE WHEEL
THAT JUST DOES IT ALL?

00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:28,081
AFTER 5,000 YEARS,
I THINK WE DESERVE AN UPGRADE,

00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,417
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, NO ONE'S
BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE IT OUT,

00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:33,020
NOT EINSTEIN, NOT DA VINCI,

00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,388
AND NOT EVEN YOU,
MR. WONDERFUL.

00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,326
BUT I DID.

00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:42,195
I REINVENTED THE WHEEL,
LITERALLY.

00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:45,465
I CAME UP WITH A MATHEMATICALLY
BALANCED DESIGN

00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,000
THAT'S BASED ON A CUBE.

00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,335
NOW, I KNOW
YOU'RE GONNA THINK,

00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,437
"HOW COULD A DESIGN
BASED ON A CUBE EVEN ROLL?"

00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:52,039
BUT TAKE A LOOK.

00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:54,174
WE DISCOVERED THAT NOT ONLY
DID OUR WHEEL ROLL,

00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,343
IT ROLLED BETTER
THAN A TRADITIONAL WHEEL.

00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,412
WE CAME UP WITH A WHEEL
THAT'S FASTER,

00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:01,048
HAS MORE GRIP, LASTS LONGER,

00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:04,117
AND GOES OVER
VIRTUALLY ANY TERRAIN.

00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:07,454
BUT WE WOULDN'T BE NAIVE ENOUGH
TO SHOW UP WITH JUST AN IDEA.

00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,092
WE STARTED OUT
TO PROVE OUR WHEEL

00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:13,160
WAS THE BEST BY GOING INTO

00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,195
ONE OF THE LARGEST CONSUMER
WHEEL INDUSTRIES,

00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,296
SKATEBOARD WHEELS,

00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:19,032
AND THE SHARK WHEEL
IS WINNING RAVE REVIEWS.

00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,202
OUR WHEELS ARE FASTER,
HAVE BETTER GRIP,

00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,972
AND ARE SMOOTHER OVER ANY SORT
OF PAVEMENT,

00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,340
SOMETHING NO OTHER WHEEL
CAN DO.

00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,110
BUT THIS IS JUST ONE OF
THE INDUSTRIES THAT WE'RE IN.

00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,180
THIS IS
OUR SKATEBOARD WHEEL.

00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,149
THIS IS THE WHEEL THAT WE'RE
SELLING WORLDWIDE RIGHT NOW.

00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:38,051
IT'S ONE OF THE FASTEST WHEELS
ON THE MARKET.

00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,220
COMING UP NOW
IS OUR MID-SIZED WHEEL.

00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,421
THIS IS ON A STROLLER.

00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:44,124
IT MAKES THE STROLLER
EASIER TO PUSH.

00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:46,093
NEXT UP, THIS IS
OUR LARGE-SIZED WHEEL.

00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:48,061
THIS GOES ON ANY TERRAIN,

00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,030
THROUGH SAND, THROUGH MUD,
THROUGH GRASS,

00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,364
AND IT JUST LOOKS AWESOME.

00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:54,968
SHARKS, I WANT TO WELCOME YOU
TO WHAT IS NOTHING LESS

00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:57,104
THAN THE REINVENTION
OF THE WHEEL.

00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:58,271
IS THIS FOR REAL?

00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,040
Grenier:
CAN I GET UP AND PULL IT?

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,108
ABSOLUTELY.
YEAH.

00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:02,275
BECAUSE WHEN I WATCHED HER
PULLING IT...

00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:03,343
IT LOOKS WOBBLY.
...IT LOOKED TO ME -- RIGHT,

00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:04,978
IT LOOKS WOBBLY,

00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:08,181
AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT ACTUALLY
DOESN'T GLIDE SMOOTHER.

00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,050
O'Leary:
LET ME TRY THIS ONE.
AND IT...

00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,284
I MEAN, IT'S BIZARRE.

00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:18,425
BUT, ACTUALLY, THIS DOES FEEL
VERY, VERY, VERY LIGHT.

00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,426
David: PLEASE, GET ON.

00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,294
I JUST HAD MY ACL REPLACED.
FEEL THIS.

00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:22,996
AS MUCH AS I WANT TO RIDE
THAT THING...

00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,432
WELL, YOU KNOW, I HATE TO,
LIKE, BE A KILLJOY,

00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:29,436
BUT AS I PUSH THIS,
IT'S GOING LIKE THIS.

00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,138
THAT'S A PROTOTYPE.

00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:33,106
WE DO HAVE TO, UNFORTUNATELY,
EXPLAIN FOR THE TREAD ON IT.

00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,108
THE ONLY THING WE HAVE THAT IS
OUR PRODUCTION WHEELS

00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,109
ARE THE SKATEBOARD WHEELS,

00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,310
AND I DEFY ANYONE
TO GO ON THOSE

00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,146
AND SEE ANYTHING
OTHER THAN PERFECTION.

00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:41,181
YOU UNDERSTAND, THOUGH, WHY
WE'RE TESTING THESE, BECAUSE --

00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:43,183
ABSOLUTELY, AND I WANT YOU TO.
THIS IS SOMETHING WE'RE --

00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:44,417
TO REINVENT THE WHEEL
IS A BIG THING.

00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,052
WE'RE SUPER PROUD
OF WHAT WE ARE.

00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,187
WE KNOW THIS IS
OUR MARQUEE PRODUCT

00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:48,255
THAT WE'VE ALREADY
FLESHED OUT,

00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,357
AND WE'RE READY TO GO
INTO THESE.

00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:52,359
WE'VE GOT BIG DEALS WORKING.
I'M DYING TO TALK ABOUT IT.

00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:54,995
HAVE YOU BEEN
SELLING ANYWHERE?
YES.

00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:58,331
WE'VE BEEN SELLING THE WHEELS
WORLDWIDE THROUGH THE INTERNET.

00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:01,434
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT,

00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:04,237
DOES THE WORLD NEED
THIS SOLUTION?

00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:07,240
THE BIG PREMISE OF YOUR
PRESENTATION WHEN YOU CAME OUT

00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,310
IS THAT THE 5,000-YEAR-OLD WHEEL
IS DEFECTIVE IN SOME WAY.

00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,344
YEAH.

00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:12,312
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG

00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,114
WITH THE REGULAR WHEEL,

00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:15,949
BUT THERE'S MILLIONS OF
DIFFERENT TYPES OF WHEELS.

00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,450
THE GEOMETRY OF OUR WHEEL

00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,153
GIVES US THE EQUIVALENT
OF A SKINNY TIRE

00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,355
WHEN IT'S JUST RUNNING
ON A HARD PAVEMENT

00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,424
BUT A FAT TIRE
WHEN IT STARTS TO SLIP.

00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,993
WE LAST LONGER,
AND WE'RE FASTER.

00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,395
THIS SHAPE, ONE LITTLE SHAPE,

00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:31,164
IT'S A PERFECT CIRCLE,
A PERFECT SPHERE,

00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,234
A PERFECT CUBE, A SQUARE,
AND, YOU KNOW, A SIGN WAVE.

00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:37,370
BUT THE QUESTION IS,
WHO CARES?

00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,207
OKAY, WELL,
IN THE SKATEBOARD INDUSTRY,

00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:42,008
THERE'S A NUMBER-ONE THING
THAT HAPPENS.

00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,176
HIT A ROCK,
YOU'RE GOING OVER IT.

00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,278
WOULD YOU NOT GO OVER
IF YOU HIT A ROCK WITH THAT?

00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:46,379
NO ROCKS, NO PROBLEM.

00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,982
WE JUST GO RIGHT OVER THEM
LIKE BUTTER.

00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:51,017
John: HOW DID YOU COME UP
WITH THIS?

00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,220
ARE YOU A SCIENTIST OR...

00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,288
I HAVE NO DEGREES.
I HAVE NONE OF THE THINGS

00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,357
THAT WOULD NORMALLY LEAD YOU
TO BE WHO I AM.

00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,391
NOT A PROBLEM.

00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:01,061
BUT IT ENDED UP,
THIS HUGE IDEA HITS ME.

00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:02,128
DAVE, THE SALES SO FAR

00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:04,130
ARE BASICALLY ON THE SKATEBOARD,
RIGHT?

00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,232
YES, 100%.

00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:07,200
THIS IS OUR FIRST PRODUCT
THAT WE CAME AND MARKETED.

00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,368
AND HOW MANY HAVE YOU SOLD?

00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,338
WE'VE SOLD OVER 4,000 UNITS
OF JUST OUR SKATEBOARD WHEEL.

00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:14,107
HOW MANY DOLLARS IS THAT?
THAT'S $183,000.

00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,442
REALLY?
IN FOUR MONTHS.

00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,077
John: HOW MUCH ARE YOU
MAKING THEM FOR,

00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:18,245
AND HOW MUCH ARE YOU SELLING
THEM FOR?

00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:20,013
MAKE THEM FOR $12,
SELL THEM FOR $69.

00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:21,448
THE MEATIEST PART
OF THIS IS,

00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:24,184
WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT
INDUSTRIAL USES.

00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:26,119
BUGABOO STROLLERS
CAME TO US.

00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,221
WE'RE DOING A DEAL
WITH RAZOR SCOOTER.

00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:32,392
I CAN'T DECIDE IF THIS IS
NUT BAR FACTOR 6.2

00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,394
OR YOU HAVE SOMETHING HERE.
I DON'T KNOW,

00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,997
BUT HERE'S HOW I'M GONNA
STRUCTURE THE DEAL

00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:38,098
TO REFLECT MY CONCERN

00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:40,133
THAT YOU'RE A NUT BAR FACTOR
6.2, ALL RIGHT?

00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,369
'CAUSE THIS IS DEFINITELY
A ROYALTY DEAL.

00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:46,006
HERE'S HOW IT'S GONNA WORK.
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU $100,000.

00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:48,008
YOU'RE GONNA PAY ME 10%
OF REVENUE

00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:51,011
UNTIL I MAKE BACK $500,000,

00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:53,313
THEN THE ROYALTY DISAPPEARS.

00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:56,182
BUT TO KEEP ME ENGAGED
AND IN LOVE WITH YOU,

00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:59,152
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME 2.5%
OF THE COMPANY TODAY.

00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:02,022
THAT WAY, I CARE ABOUT YOU
AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT.

00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:05,158
THANK YOU FOR YOUR OFFER.
WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:08,061
SO, THIS COULD BE GREAT.

00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:10,430
BUT I GOT UP,
I WHEELED THEM AROUND,

00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,299
BUT THEY WERE A LITTLE WOBBLY.

00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:16,069
ALSO, WATCHING THEM,
KIND OF DIZZYING FOR ME.

00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,237
I AM OUT.

00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:20,240
REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.
THANK YOU.

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,975

WITH THIS?

YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO PAY
TO COME INTO THE CAT CAFé.

SPEND TIME WITH THE KITTIES.

HOW IS IT DIFFERENT THAN, LIKE,
A PET STORE OR, YOU KNOW...

00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,110
BECAUSE YOU ACTUALLY GET
THE CHANCE TO SIT DOWN,

YES. YES, THERE IS.

THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

YES, THERE IS,
AND IN FLORIDA,

00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:02,195
A FOOD ESTABLISHMENT
IS NOT REALLY CONSIDERED

WHERE RESCUE CATS...
YES.

MAYBE HAVE A DANISH AND A COFFEE
OR A GLASS OF WINE.

00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:24,417
MY QUESTION IS,

00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:26,219
WHY WOULD SOMEBODY
PAY TO DO THAT

00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:28,454
WHEN, TECHNICALLY, THEY COULD GO
TO AN ANTI-CRUELTY SOCIETY

00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:32,124
AND ACTUALLY SPEND TIME
WITH THE CATS THERE?

00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:33,426
OH, 'CAUSE THAT'S NOT A VERY
NICE ENVIRONMENT TO GO.

00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,094

A NICE ENVIRONMENT, BUT...

00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:36,295

I HAVE FIVE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE

SOLELY DEDICATED TO CATS.

00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,002
WHAT I'VE LEARNED THERE

00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,972
IS THAT 70% OF CATS THAT GO
INTO SHELTERS GET KILLED.

00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:47,039
SO THIS WOULD BE DIFFERENT

00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,941
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE
IN A FACILITY

OF IT OR NOT,

YOU DON'T HAVE

00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:08,394
AND WE'RE IN CONVERSATIONS

00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:10,162
WITH SEVERAL HIGH-VOLUME
MANUFACTURERS

00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,330
TO LICENSE THIS IDEA.

00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,998
HOW MANY PREORDERS
HAVE YOU TAKEN?

00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,133
WE NOW HAVE DEPOSITS

00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:17,002
THAT REPRESENT OUR FIRST
$350,000 IN PRE-SALES.

00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:20,239
AND WHEN DO YOU PLAN ON
DELIVERING THE FIRST UNITS?

00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:22,174
AND SO, THAT'S REALLY WHY
WE'RE HERE TODAY.

00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,375
WE COULD BE TO MARKET
WITHIN A YEAR

00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,977
WITH THE RIGHT
MANUFACTURER.

00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:26,445
John:
DID YOU DESIGN THIS YOURSELF,

00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:28,214
OR DID YOU GO TO ANOTHER MAKER

00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:30,249
AND HAVE THEM PUT IT TOGETHER
FOR YOU?

00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:32,051
NO, I'M A MAKER.
I'M A BUILDER.

00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:33,986
FOR YEARS,
I'VE BEEN A TOY INVENTOR

00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:35,387
AT IDEO IN PALO ALTO,
CALIFORNIA,

00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:38,991
AND I'M CREATING AND DESIGNING
AND INVENTING

00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:42,061
TOYS FOR LICENSE
WITHIN THE TOY INDUSTRY.

00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:43,162
WHAT IS IDEO?

00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:44,997
IDEO IS A GLOBAL DESIGN
CONSULTANCY

00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:46,232
THAT DOES
USER-CENTERED DESIGN.

00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:48,000
ONE OF THE TOP IN THE WORLD.

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,336
YOU CAN WALK THE HALLS
OF MAJOR TOY STORES TODAY

00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:51,337
AND SEE MY WORK.

00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:53,272
THIS IS LIKE
THE ULTIMATE TOY TO ME

00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:55,374
FOR, YOU KNOW, MEN, WOMEN.

00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:59,211
DO YOU NEED A MOTORCYCLE
OPERATING LICENSE

00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,146
TO OPERATE THIS?

00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:02,414
CALIFORNIA
AND THE EUROPEAN UNION,

00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:04,016
BECAUSE IT HAS THREE WHEELS,

00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:06,018
YOU DO NOT NEED A MOTORCYCLE
LICENSE TO RIDE SWAY.

00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:08,254
HOW MUCH MONEY
HAVE YOU INVESTED SO FAR

00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:10,022
TO GET TO THIS PROTOTYPE?

00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:11,457
TOTAL CAPITAL SPENT,

00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:15,227
I WOULD SAY IT'S BETWEEN
$100,000 AND $200,000.

00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,463
IMPRESSIVE.
DO YOU HAVE ANY PATENTS?

00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:21,000
ONE OF THE BIGGEST PATENTS
THAT WE'RE SUPER PROUD OF IS,

00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,102
WE TAKE THE BATTERY MASS
OF THE VEHICLE

00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:25,037
AND WE USE
THIS BOTTOM PLATFORM

00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:27,206
AS AN INTEGRATED
STABLE STORAGE PLATFORM

00:23:27,206 --> 00:23:29,375
IN WHICH BATTERIES, CHARGERS,
CONTROLLERS,

00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,176
ALL OF THAT STUFF GOES --

00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:33,145
SO THERE'S NO HARDWARE
IN THIS TOP PORTION.

00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:34,446
THAT LEAVES IT OPEN
FOR STORAGE.

00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,982
IT LEAVES IT OPEN
FOR HARDWARE ATTACHMENTS,

00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:38,317
ALL KINDS OF
MODULAR ACCESSORIES.

00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:40,252
SO, SORRY,
THAT'S A PATENT IS...
THAT'S A PATENT.

00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,054
...PUTTING EVERYTHING
DOWN BELOW?
YES, SIR.

00:23:42,054 --> 00:23:45,324
HOW HARD WOULD IT BE FOR SOMEONE
TO GET AROUND YOUR PATENTS

00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:47,326
AND ACHIEVE
SOMETHING SIMILAR?

00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:50,129
A LOT HARDER THAN WORKING
WITH US TO LICENSE IT.

00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:52,164
[ CHUCKLES ]
LISTEN, YOU'RE A BRILLIANT
DESIGNER.

00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:53,299
YOU HAVE A PROVEN TRACK RECORD.

00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:55,401
OBVIOUSLY, WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS VERY INNOVATIVE,

00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:56,402
AND IT'S INTERESTING.

00:23:56,402 --> 00:24:00,339
THE MARKET
THAT YOU'RE GOING AFTER

00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:03,108
HAS BEEN IN DEVELOPMENT NOW
FOR ABOUT A DECADE.

00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:07,246
BUT, YOU KNOW, THIS IS SORT OF
A BINARY DECISION FOR ME.

00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:11,116
I BASICALLY BUY AN OPTION
FOR $300,000,

00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:14,253
AND THEN I HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE
IF YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL

00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:16,388
IN GETTING
A DISTRIBUTION PARTNER,

00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:19,391
A MARKETING PARTNER,
A MANUFACTURING PARTNER,

00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:22,061
'CAUSE THE ONLY WAY I'LL EVER
GET MY CAPITAL BACK IS,

00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:23,362
ALL THREE OF THOSE
COME TOGETHER.

00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:28,133
AND THEN, ON TOP OF THAT,
THE MARKET HAS TO TAKE OFF.

00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,435
WE'RE TALKING TO
OVER FIVE MANUFACTURERS

00:24:29,435 --> 00:24:31,337
RIGHT NOW THAT ARE INTERESTED
IN DOING THIS.

00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:32,304
THEY'RE REVIEWING THIS.

00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,340
AND FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.

00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,343
MM-HMM.
THANKS FOR THE TIME.

00:24:37,343 --> 00:24:40,212
UM...

00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:42,081
YEAH, I THINK --

00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:44,049
Woodman: I THINK
YOU GOT TO BE CAREFUL.

00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:47,453
IT'S A BIG HURDLE TO DRIVE
AWARENESS OF THE ACCESSIBILITY,

00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:49,254
HOW EASY IT IS TO RIDE,

00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:51,357
'CAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE
WILL LOOK AT THIS

00:24:51,357 --> 00:24:53,993
WHO WOULD BE INTIMIDATED
BY A MOTORCYCLE,

00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,195
AND LOOKING AT THIS,
IT LOOKS INTIMIDATING.

00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:57,329
I MEAN,
I LOOK AT IT, AND I SAY,

00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,131
"SWEET, I WANT TO GO RIP
THIS THING."
MM-HMM.

00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:04,970
BUT SOMEBODY WHO IS NOT ALREADY
GOING TO RIDE A MOTORCYCLE

00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,106
ISN'T GONNA LOOK AT THIS
AND SAY, "OH, I'M ALL OVER IT."

00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:11,377
GETTING THE CONSUMER TO SAY,
"AHA! THAT THING IS FOR ME"...

00:25:11,377 --> 00:25:14,113
RIGHT.
...I THINK A LOT OF THOSE

00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:18,083
CUSTOMERS WILL ALREADY BE
INCLINED TO RIDE A SCOOTER

00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:21,120
OR RIDE A MOTORCYCLE,
AND YOU ASKED --

00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,421
YEAH, THE "WOW" FACTOR,
ESPECIALLY IN SAN FRANCISCO --

00:25:22,421 --> 00:25:26,191
ARE YOU KIDDING ME? --
EVERY LITTLE TECH KID --

00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,293
YEAH,
BUT THAT'S SAN FRANCISCO.

00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:30,396
THOSE OLD LADIES IN THE CASINOS
PLAYING THE PENNY SLOTS

00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:32,164
WILL HAVE THESE THINGS
ALL DAY LONG.

00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:33,232
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:35,034
JOE, ONE CHALLENGE I SEE IS,

00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,235
OF COURSE, DISTRIBUTION.

00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:38,237
THE NEXT CHALLENGE I SEE
IS MAINTENANCE.

00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:40,439
YOU KNOW, THIS THING IS GONNA BE
PLAYED WITH A LOT,

00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:43,275
AND HOW WILL PEOPLE BE ABLE
TO, YOU KNOW, GET THE PARTS?

00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:45,144
WILL THEY BE ABLE
TO GET THE PARTS?

00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:46,145
WHO MAINTAINS IT?

00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:50,149
I THINK THERE'S
A LONG, HARD ROAD

00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:53,318
TO SUCCESS WITH THIS,
SO I'M DEFINITELY A CUSTOMER,

00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:55,988
BUT AS FOR AN INVESTOR,
I'M OUT.

00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:57,222
WELL, THANK YOU, DAYMOND.

00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,291
WE LOOK FORWARD
TO SELLING YOU ONE.

00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,393
YOU REMIND ME OF EARLY DAYS
AT GoPro

00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:04,329
WHERE I HAD
MY ORIGINAL INVENTION,

00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:08,233
AND MY DREAM WAS TO LICENSE IT
TO ANOTHER COMPANY

00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,102
SO THEY WOULD GO DO
ALL THE WORK,

00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:13,105
'CAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO
BUILD A BUSINESS AROUND MY IDEA.

00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:14,206
I JUST HAD THE IDEA.

00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:19,344
AND I ACTUALLY WAS IN
LICENSE TALKS WITH KODAK,

00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:21,447
AND THEY BACKED OUT,
AND THEY DIDN'T LICENSE IT,

00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:23,382
AND AT THE TIME,
I WAS DISAPPOINTED.

00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:26,051
AND, BOY, WAS I LUCKY
THEY DIDN'T LICENSE IT

00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,087
BECAUSE IT FORCED ME
TO GO BUILD GoPro,

00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:32,257
AND THIS SEEMS SORT OF LIKE
A SIMILAR OPPORTUNITY.

00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:35,227
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE
QUITE A BIT LESS MONEY

00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:37,096
IF IT'S SUCCESSFUL AS A LICENSE

00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,264
THAN IF YOU BUILT
THE BUSINESS YOURSELF.

00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:42,101
YOU DON'T EVEN NEED
TO SELL THAT MANY...

00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,368
RIGHT.
...FOR YOU TO MAKE A HANDSOME --

00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,304
YEAH, BUT YOU DO NEED
THE CAPITAL INVESTMENT.

00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:48,207
THE DIFFERENCE,
THOUGH, IS --
HE DOES, HE DOES,
BUT IF HE CAME IN HERE --

00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:49,441
'CAUSE TAKING $200,000
AND BUILDING CAMERAS,

00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,110
WHICH YOU WERE AMAZING
AT DOING, RIGHT?

00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,311
YEAH.
$2,000 --

00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:55,214
$200,000 DOESN'T GET HIM
THROUGH THE FIRST WAR.

00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:57,249
WELL, IT GOT HIM THIS FAR,
SO HE'S OBVIOUSLY WICKED SMART.

00:26:57,249 --> 00:26:58,417
RAISING THE CAPITAL
WON'T BE HARD.

00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:00,252
THE HARD PART IS
GONNA BE TAKING THE TIME

00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:02,187
TO BUILD THE BUSINESS THAT
HAS THE INFRASTRUCTURE...

00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,423
ABSOLUTELY.
...TO GO DO ALL
THE THINGS YOU WANT.

00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:07,059
YEAH, BUT, I MEAN --
ONE OF THE STRATEGIES IS TO FIND
A COMPANY THAT --

00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:09,261
THAT, THROUGH LICENSING
OR JOINT VENTURE,

00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:11,430
YOU KNOW, IS GOING
TO HELP FUND THIS...

00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:14,133
BUYING YOU.
...WILL EVENTUALLY BUY US.

00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,200
THAT'S WHERE
I AGREE WITH NICK

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,401
'CAUSE IF YOU'RE GONNA
TAKE IT ON...

00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:18,203
AND DO IT, JUST DO IT.

00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,404
THIS IS A VERY
BINARY PRODUCT.

00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:23,976
YEAH.
IT'S EITHER A GRAND SLAM
OR IT'S NOTHING, RIGHT?

00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:24,443
YEAH.
I LOVE IT.

00:27:24,443 --> 00:27:26,178
THANK YOU.

00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:28,213
I MEAN, THE CHALLENGE IS,
ANYBODY'S GONNA TAKE MY CALL,

00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:29,414
BUT I'M NOT
GONNA BE ABLE TO SIT

00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:31,183
AND HAVE A CONVERSATION
AND EXPLAIN IT.

00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:32,985
I CAN GET INTO ALL THE WEEDS
ON TECH,

00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,286
BUT I CAN'T GET INTO THE WEEDS
ON THIS,

00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:35,454
AND SO FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.

00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:39,091
ALL RIGHT,

00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:42,094

YOU'RE ONTO SOMETHING.

00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:45,063
YOU'RE REALLY PASSIONATE.
YOU'RE WICKED SMART.

00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:46,365
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
A VERY GOOD DESIGNER.

00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:48,433
I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD
REALLY CONSIDER

00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:50,235
CONTINUING TO DO
WHAT YOU DO

00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:52,171
AND THEN FIND PEOPLE
TO HELP YOU

00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,072
BUILD A BUSINESS
AROUND YOURSELF

00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:56,008
AND SLOWLY,
ORGANICALLY BUILD SOMETHING.

00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,342
RIGHT.
BUT I'M OUT.

00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:05,317

AND HAM ON THIS THING IS OUT,

FOR MY TIME.
BUT WE DO HAVE

WAITING IN THE WINGS.

00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:11,323

ON QVC.

00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:14,259
OH, MY GOD!
O'Leary: NO, I SEE YOU --

00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:16,028
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
A NICE GUY.

00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,329
I'M JUST KIDDING.

00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:19,198
YOU KNOW THAT I'M
IN RETAILERS EVERYWHERE,

00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:22,100
AND I THINK IT'S PRETTY COOL.
I LIKE IT.
YEE-HAW!

00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,336
I'M NOT SURE, YOU KNOW, WHAT
I COULD BRING TO THE TABLE

00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:25,404
TO YOU BESIDES THE MONEY,

00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:27,139
BESIDES MAYBE MAKING SOME CALLS

00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:29,341
WHERE THEY WOULD ANSWER
THE PHONE, GET A CONNECTION.

00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:31,410
YOU SEEM TO BE DOING A LOT
OF THAT YOURSELF.

00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:35,047
AND FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.

00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:39,218
OKAY, SO -- SO, I MEAN,

00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,286
JUST TO SPEAK
TO SOME OF THESE POINTS --

00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:43,088
JOE, AT THIS POINT,
IT DOESN'T MATTER

00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:44,256
BECAUSE ALL
THE SHARKS ARE OUT.

00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:45,457
OKAY.

00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,326
WELL, I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.

00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:50,195
JOE, LET ME
JUST TELL YOU THIS.

00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:51,330
THERE HAVE BEEN PEOPLE
WHO HAVE STOOD THERE

00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,031
WHO HAVE HAD SECOND CHANCES
TO COME BACK...
YEAH.

00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:54,399
...BECAUSE THEY'VE TAKEN
THE PRODUCT

00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,101
AND GOTTEN IT
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:58,136
ALL OF US HERE WOULD AT LEAST
CONSIDER BEING A CUSTOMER.

00:28:58,136 --> 00:28:59,304
I KNOW I WOULD, RIGHT?
YEAH. I AM.

00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:02,007
GET IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL
AND COME ON BACK.

00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:03,242
I THINK WE ALL THINK
YOU'RE GONNA BE SUCCESSFUL.

00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,344
THIS IS REALLY AWESOME.
SO, WHY NOT INVEST?

00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:10,949
$300,000 IS THE FIGURE
THAT WE -- BINARY IS --

00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,117
SUCCESS IS BINARY.

00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:14,152
IF YOU WON'T INVEST $300,000
TO MAKE SURE

00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:16,388
THAT WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
WE'RE GONNA DO WITH IT --

00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:17,422
JOE, YOU GOT TO --

00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,325
WAIT, WAIT.
SO -- SO, MAKE ME AN OFFER.

00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:25,163
MAKE YOU AN OFFER?

00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:26,398
RIGHT, KNOWING THAT IT'S
JUST MONEY, CASH MONEY,

00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:29,234
'CAUSE I'M NOT -- I'LL PICK UP
THE PHONE IF I NEED TO,

00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:32,104
BUT I DON'T KNOW THE INDUSTRY,
I DON'T KNOW THE PEOPLE.

00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:37,242
OKAY, WE'LL GO -- WE WOULD GO
$300,000 FOR 20%.

00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,252
DONE.

00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:50,022
OH.

00:29:50,022 --> 00:29:51,323
CONGRATULATIONS.
THIS IS AN AWESOME VEHICLE.

00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:52,391
THANK YOU.

00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:54,092
THAT'S GREAT, MARK.
I LOVE YOU DID THAT.

00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:55,294
I'M EXCITED.
YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA BE
PART OF AN INDUSTRY.

00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:57,429
OH, WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT HAPPEN.
WE'RE GONNA MAKE BOOKOO BUCKS.

00:29:57,429 --> 00:29:59,998
JOE, I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYBODY GIVE
THEMSELVES MOUTH TO MOUTH

00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:01,300
THE WAY YOU JUST DID.
[ LAUGHS ]

00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,401
THANKS, YOU GUYS.

00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:03,402
CONGRATS, MAN.
TAKE IT EASY.

00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:05,137
Woodman: WHEW!

00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:08,040
WELL, I SHOULDN'T HAVE GONE 20%.
I SHOULD'VE GONE 15%.

00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,207
BUT THAT'S -- THAT'S OKAY.

00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:11,410
I THOUGHT THEY WERE GONNA
PULL THE PLUG ON ME.

00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,211
WELL, THAT WAS INTERESTING,
MARK.

00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:15,013
Grenier: THAT WAS GREAT.
IT WAS EASY.

00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:16,982
IT WAS JUST A QUESTION OF, OKAY,
IF IT'S THE RIGHT AMOUNT,

00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,083
THEN IT'S THE RISK/REWARD,
RIGHT?

00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:19,318
BUT CAN I BUY ONE FROM YOU
AT A DISCOUNT?

00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,086
NO. [ LAUGHS ]

00:30:21,086 --> 00:30:22,387
THERE GOES <i>YOUR</i> GoPro.

00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:24,323
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:37,102
HEY, I'M CHRIS RUDER,
AND MY COMPANY IS SPIKEBALL.

00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:39,971
I'M HERE IN SAN DIEGO TODAY
FOR A SPIKEBALL TOURNAMENT.

00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:42,274
WE GOT 45 TEAMS, AND THEY ARE
PSYCHED TO PLAY TODAY.

00:30:42,274 --> 00:30:45,010
THE WAY I LIKE TO DESCRIBE
SPIKEBALL IS,

00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,245
IF VOLLEYBALL AND FOUR SQUARE
HAD A BABY,

00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:49,114
IT WOULD BE CALLED SPIKEBALL.

00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:51,383
SPIKEBALL IS SO MUCH FUN
BECAUSE IT'S SO ACTIVE,

00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:52,984
IT'S SO COMPETITIVE.

00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:55,153
THERE'S STRATEGY,
A TON OF TRASH TALKING --

00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:56,321
ABSOLUTE BLAST TO PLAY.

00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:59,124
SPIKEBALL STARTED AS A FUN,
CASUAL BACKYARD GAME.

00:30:59,124 --> 00:31:01,126
IT'S BECOMING
A COMPETITIVE SPORT,

00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:02,427
ESPECIALLY ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES.

00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,429
THANKS FOR COMING, EVERYBODY!

00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:07,132
SPIKEBALL!
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

00:31:07,132 --> 00:31:09,067
POTENTIAL FOR SPIKEBALL
IS LIMITLESS.

00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,168
THERE WILL BE SPONSORS.

00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:12,137
THERE WILL BE
PROFESSIONAL PLAYERS.

00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:14,206
IT WILL BE THE NEXT GREAT
AMERICAN SPORT.

00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:15,340
I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE MAY THINK

00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,209
I'M OFF MY ROCKER BY TALKING
LIKE THAT,

00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:19,010
BUT WHEN WE STARTED
THIS COMPANY,

00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,379
PEOPLE THOUGHT WE WERE CRAZY,
AS WELL,

00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,013
AND LOOK WHERE WE ARE TODAY.

00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:23,181
THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL SPIKEBALL!

00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:24,983
WE'RE HOPING TO BLOW
SPIKEBALL UP.

00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:26,985
THE SHARKS, I BELIEVE,
CAN HELP US GET THERE.

00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:48,407
HELLO, SHARKS.

00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,175
MY NAME IS CHRIS RUDER,
AND I'M FROM CHICAGO.

00:31:50,175 --> 00:31:54,012
I'M HERE TODAY LOOKING FOR
AN INVESTMENT OF $500,000

00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:57,149
IN EXCHANGE FOR 10%
OF MY COMPANY, SPIKEBALL.

00:31:57,149 --> 00:32:01,219
SPIKEBALL IS POISED TO BE
THE NEXT GREAT AMERICAN SPORT.

00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:04,389
LIKE ALL GREAT SPORTS,
SPIKEBALL IS VERY EASY TO LEARN

00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:07,125
BUT REALLY, REALLY DIFFICULT
TO MASTER.

00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:09,361
IT CAN BE A CASUAL,
FUN BACKYARD GAME,

00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:12,030
OR IT CAN BE HARD-CORE
COMPETITION.

00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:15,133
ANOTHER GREAT THING IS,
SPIKEBALL IS ULTRA-PORTABLE.

00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:17,035
SO, ALL YOU NEED IS THIS BALL,
THAT NET,

00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:18,136
AND ONE OF THESE BACKPACKS,

00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:20,071
AND YOU CAN TAKE IT
ABSOLUTELY ANYWHERE.

00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:21,339
SO, STANDING TO MY RIGHT HERE

00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:23,975
IN THE BLACK JERSEYS
IS CHICO SPIKEBALL.

00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:26,111
THEY HAVE BEEN THE
NUMBER-ONE-RANKED TEAM

00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:28,113
IN THE COUNTRY
FOR OVER 12 MONTHS.

00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:31,016
THESE GUYS ARE JUST
ABSOLUTELY DOMINATING.

00:32:31,016 --> 00:32:32,984
DOMINATING.
[ LAUGHS ]

00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:35,253
THEY'RE GONNA PLAY A COUPLE
POINTS AGAINST TIRO UNITED.

00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:37,088
NOW, YOU'RE GONNA SEE
IN A SECOND,

00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:38,223
THEY'RE GONNA SERVE THE BALL

00:32:38,223 --> 00:32:40,459
BASICALLY JUST BY BOUNCING IT
OFF THE NET TOWARDS TIRO.

00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,127
NOW, JUST LIKE IN VOLLEYBALL,

00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,162
TIRO HAS UP TO THREE HITS
BETWEEN EACH OTHER

00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:46,198
BEFORE THEY HAVE TO SPIKE IT
BACK ON THE NET.

00:32:46,198 --> 00:32:47,265
NOW, THEY, OF COURSE,

00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:49,334
WANT TO SPIKE IT SO CHICO
CAN'T GET TO IT.

00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:52,437
IF YOU CAN'T GET IT ON THE NET,
THE OTHER TEAM GETS A POINT.

00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:54,372
FIRST TEAM TO 21 WINS.

00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:58,009
ONCE THE BALL IS IN PLAY,
THERE ARE NO SIDES.

00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:01,446
ALL FOUR PLAYERS CAN RUN
ABSOLUTELY ANYWHERE THEY WANT.

00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:03,281
GENTLEMEN.
I'M GONNA ASK THE GUYS

00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:05,317
TO COME OUT HERE
AND PLAY A COUPLE POINTS.

00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,388
OH!

00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,029
OHH!

00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:20,031
AWESOME.
THANK YOU, GUYS.

00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:23,134
WHO INVENTED THIS GAME --
YOU?

00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:25,003
NO, BROUGHT IT BACK TO LIFE.

00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,404
SO, IT WAS AROUND BACK IN 1989,

00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:29,975
AND ONE OF MY GOOD FRIENDS
BOUGHT IT AT A TOY STORE,

00:33:29,975 --> 00:33:32,043
AND THEY AND MY OLDER BROTHER
PLAYED A BUNCH

00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:33,144
AND ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT.

00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:34,980
AND ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO,
YOU KNOW,

00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,248
THE LIGHT BULB KIND OF WENT OFF.

00:33:36,248 --> 00:33:38,283
WE WENT HOME AND KIND OF
DID OUR HOMEWORK,

00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:40,986
FOUND OUT THAT THE PRODUCT
HAD BEEN OFF THE MARKET

00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:42,220
FOR LIKE 15, 20 YEARS.

00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,188
SO, WHO OWNS SPIKEBALL?

00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:46,091
WE DO.
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

00:33:46,091 --> 00:33:49,027
UH, THEIR RIGHTS
WERE COMPLETELY EXPIRED, SO --

00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,428
AND YOU JUST RECLAIMED THEM?

00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:53,431
THE TRADEMARK, YES.
THERE WAS NEVER A PATENT.

00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:56,401
HAS IT EVER BEEN CONTESTED
NOW THAT IT'S SUCCESSFUL?

00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:59,237
NO, AND WE ACTUALLY DID GET
A UTILITY PATENT.

00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:01,439
THERE'S SOME GUY THAT'S
GONNA BE WATCHING THIS GOING,

00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:03,008
"OH, MY GOODNESS."

00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:04,376
YOU MENTIONED, OBVIOUSLY,
THAT IT'S A SPORT.

00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:07,245
WHERE CAN YOU TAKE IT?
HOW BIG CAN IT BE?
IT CAN BE HUGE.

00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:10,148
SO, WE'VE GOT A GOVERNING BODY
CALLED USA SPIKEBALL,

00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:12,083
SO WE HAVE TOURNAMENTS
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:13,351
HOW MANY TOURNAMENTS
ARE BEING PLAYED?

00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:15,120
WE'LL HAVE ABOUT 100 TOURNAMENTS
THIS YEAR.

00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,421
AND DO YOU CHARGE THEM?

00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:18,189
IT'S "LOOSELY"
A FREEMIUM MODEL.

00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:20,125
WE ALSO SELL MEMBERSHIPS.
AND HOW DID YOU --

00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:22,394
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
HE SELLS MEMBERSHIPS.
TELL US ABOUT THAT.

00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:24,329
YEAH, SO, YOU CAN BUY
A "BALLER" MEMBERSHIP

00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:27,132
ON USA SPIKEBALL.
WAIT, SAY THAT.

00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:29,167

ARE YOU ALL BALLERS?

00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:30,268

OH, THAT'S MARK'S WORD.
OH, YEAH, OF COURSE.

00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:32,971

IN THE HOUSE!

00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:34,239
Woodman:
WHAT'S THE DEMOGRAPHIC?

00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,041
WHAT'S THE AVERAGE AGE
OF THE --

00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:37,409
18 TO 24 MALE
IS OUR SWEET SPOT.

00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,210
WHAT DOES ONE COST?

00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,179
$59.99, PLUS SHIPPING.

00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:44,115
CAN I GO TO A TOY STORE
AND BUY IT?

00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:45,216
SOME TOY STORES, YES.

00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:48,053
WE'RE FOCUSING MORE ON
SPORTING-GOODS STORES.

00:34:48,053 --> 00:34:49,354
WE'VE BEEN AROUND
ABOUT SIX YEARS.

00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:52,157
THE FIRST FIVE YEARS,
PURE E-COMMERCE.

00:34:52,157 --> 00:34:54,392
CHRIS, HOW MANY UNITS
DO YOU SELL IN A YEAR?

00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:58,396
THIS YEAR,
WE'VE SOLD 29,000 UNITS.

00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:00,165
AND HOW MUCH DID THEY COST
TO MAKE?

00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:02,467
UH, A LITTLE OVER $14
A UNIT.

00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:05,070
SO, LAST YEAR,
YOUR TOTAL GROSS SALES?

00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:07,305
$1.4 MILLION.

00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:09,341
AND THIS YEAR, YOU EXPECT IT
TO BE AROUND 3...

00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:12,110
BETWEEN 3.2 AND 3.5.

00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,212
AND YOU'VE GOT TO BE KILLING IT,
THEN, BECAUSE IT'S ALL MARGIN,

00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:16,114
SO WHAT ARE YOU -- WHAT ARE YOU
NETTING AT THE BOTTOM LINE?

00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,350
SO, LAST YEAR, WE NETTED,
I WANT TO SAY,

00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,218
ABOUT 170,000, 180,000 GRAND.

00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:21,252
WHY SO LITTLE?

00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:23,188
RETAIL'S GROWING LIKE CRAZY.

00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:25,223
SO THAT TAKES YOUR MARGIN.
SO OUR E-COMMERCE
BUSINESS GOOD,

00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:27,258
BUT RETAIL
IS REALLY EATING IN.

00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:29,094
SO, HOW MUCH
ARE YOU PAYING YOURSELF?

00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:32,097
UM, MY SALARY?
$175,000.

00:35:32,097 --> 00:35:33,198
THERE YOU GO.
OKAY, THAT MAKES IT UP.

00:35:33,198 --> 00:35:34,399
GOOD FOR YOU.

00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:37,268
CAN I GO BACK TO ONE THING,
JUST THE PRICE?

00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:38,370
SURE.

00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,405
CAN YOU GET YOUR COSTS DOWN
FROM $14?

00:35:40,405 --> 00:35:41,973
HAVE YOU TRIED THAT?
ABSOLUTELY.

00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:42,974
WHERE DO YOU THINK
IT COULD GO TO?

00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,110
UM, MY --

00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,379
I'D LOVE TO GET IT DOWN
TO THE $10 RANGE.

00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:49,280
John: CHRIS, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
USE THE MONEY FOR?

00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,116
WORKING CAPITAL.

00:35:51,116 --> 00:35:53,985
WE'RE STARTING TO GET
REALLY, REALLY BIG ORDERS

00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,220
FROM REALLY BIG RETAILERS.

00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,388
HOW BIG,
FROM WHO, FOR WHAT?

00:35:56,388 --> 00:35:58,289
THE BIGGEST WE WORK WITH
IS DICK'S SPORTING GOODS.

00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:01,292
WE'VE GOT P.O.s
FOR 10,000 UNITS TO SHIP.

00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:03,261
HAVE YOU DONE ANY TESTS
WITH THEM

00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:05,363
TO SEE HOW IT SELLS
THROUGH THE STORE?

00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:07,132
YEAH. OUR INITIAL TEST
WAS 100 STORES.

00:36:07,132 --> 00:36:09,134
YOU STARTED YOUR TEST
HOW LONG AGO?

00:36:09,134 --> 00:36:11,169
UH, TWO MONTHS AGO.

00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,138
DID THEY TAKE IT TO MORE STORES
EACH TIME?

00:36:13,138 --> 00:36:14,939
WE'RE IN 250 NOW.

00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:17,108

PROTECT YOUR BRAND,

FROM THAT OPPORTUNITY.

YOUR GOALS THIS YEAR,

LIKE CALLING YOUR BABY UGLY.

THAN THAT.

IS WORTH

00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:16,301
ABOUT SEVEN TIMES
THE CASH FLOW.

2.5 MILLION BUCKS.

IT WAY TOO MUCH.

00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:33,318

ANOTHER SHARK MIGHT BE.

00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:36,020

"YOU THINK THAT'S MAD?

HIS BACKYARD GAME, SPIKEBALL.

I'M IMPRESSED, OKAY?

YOU'VE ACHIEVED SO FAR.

ABOUT IT BEING WORTH A LOT,
