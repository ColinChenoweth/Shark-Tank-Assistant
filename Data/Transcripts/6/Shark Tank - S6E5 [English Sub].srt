Narrator:
WELCOME TO THE SHARK TANK,

00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:05,005
WHERE ENTREPRENEURS
SEEK AN INVESTMENT

00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:08,008
TO START, GROW, OR SAVE
THEIR BUSINESS.

00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,077
LAST YEAR, WE ACTUALLY DID
$5.7 MILLION IN SALES.

00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:11,211
WHOA.
WHOO!

00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:13,013
NOT SO FUNNY ANYMORE.

00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,181
Narrator: IF THE SHARKS HEAR
A GREAT IDEA...

00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,183
[ LAUGHS ]
...THEY'LL INVEST
THEIR OWN MONEY...

00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:19,186
I ACTUALLY COULD LEARN
FROM YOU.

00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:21,121
...AND FIGHT EACH OTHER
FOR A DEAL.

00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:23,390
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $600,000
FOR 15%.

00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,393
I CAN GUARANTEE YOU THE DEVIL
WOULD GIVE YOU A BETTER DEAL.

00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:28,462
Narrator: BUT THE ENTREPRENEURS
MUST GET THE FULL AMOUNT

00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:32,099
THEY'RE ASKING FOR, OR THEY'LL
WALK AWAY WITH NOTHING.

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:34,101
I SEE YOU GUYS GOING
DOWN THE TOILET RIGHT NOW.

00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:35,168
YOU'RE ABOUT TO
LOSE EVERYTHING.

00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:37,104
WOULD YOU CONSIDER 40%?

00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:38,071
NO.

00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:39,973
DAMN IT.

00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:42,075
Narrator:
WHO ARE THE SHARKS?

00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:48,415

00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:51,385
KEVIN O'LEARY IS A SHREWD
VENTURE CAPITALIST

00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,220

00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,155
SELLING A CHILDREN'S
EDUCATIONAL COMPANY

00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:57,424
FOR OVER $4 BILLION.

00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:01,395
DAYMOND JOHN DOMINATED

00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:10,337

FIRST INTO THE TANK
ARE ENTREPRENEURS

00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,106
WHO BELIEVE THEY HAVE
THE NEXT BIG THING IN TOYS.

00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:54,247
HELLO, SHARKAROOS.
HELLO, SHARKAROOS.

00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:55,415
I'M RACHEL McMURTREY.

00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,217
AND I'M STEVE McMURTREY.

00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,219
AND WE ARE
THE PROUD OWNERS OF...

00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,121
THE JUNGLE JUMPAROO.
THE JUNGLE JUMPAROO.

00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,990
A BETTER WAY TO BOUNCE.

00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:07,394
WE ARE ASKING FOR $100,000
FOR 20% EQUITY OF OUR COMPANY.

00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:09,262
OUR TOY
IS BOTH UNIQUE AND FUN,

00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,365
AND THERE'S NOTHING
ON THE MARKET LIKE IT.

00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:14,401
TO SHOW YOU HOW FUN IT IS,
LET'S SEE IT IN ACTION.

00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:16,069
COME ON, KIDS.

00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,205
COME ON, GUYS.
COME ON. COME ON.
COME ON! WHOO!

00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:19,439
COME ON,
COME ON, COME ON.

00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,308
YEAH! WHOO-HOO!

00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,310
John: SHE GETTING SOME AIR.
LOOK AT THAT.
YEAH!

00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,212
Steve: LET'S SEE
HOW HIGH YOU CAN JUMP.

00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:26,413
HEY!
WHO CAN JUMP THE HIGHEST?

00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,949
WHOO!
WHOO-HOO!

00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:29,950
WHOA.
YEAH!

00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,184
LOOKS REALLY FUN.

00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:32,352
THAT'S A BROKEN ANKLE
WAITING TO HAPPEN.

00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,154
ALL RIGHT, KIDS.
LET'S BOUNCE ON OUT OF HERE.

00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,222
AAH!

00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:37,157
YEAH, COME ON. LET'S BOUNCE.
RUN, RUN, RUN.

00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,125
[ LAUGHS ]

00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,359
AWW.
Rachel: [ LAUGHS ]

00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:42,162
THE JUNGLE JUMPAROO
IS THE SAFER WAY TO BOUNCE.

00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,430
WITH STRONG,
STURDY POLES,

00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:47,034
KIDS GET THE SENSE OF FLYING IN
THE AIR WITHOUT LOSING CONTROL.

00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:49,269
Steve:
IT'S A JUMP/SWING/CLIMB TOY.

00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:53,073
IT'S PERFECT FOR ALL 365 DAYS
OUT OF THE YEAR,

00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:56,109
ALL SEASONS,
INSIDE OR OUTSIDE YOUR HOME,

00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,377
AND IT COMES
IN TWO SIZES.

00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:59,379
WHO WANTS TO JUMP ON BOARD

00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:03,016
THIS TOTALLY TUBULAR OPPORTUNITY
WITH US?

00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,251
HOW DID YOU
COME UP WITH THIS?

00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:08,021
Rachel: A FARMER 30 YEARS AGO
MADE ONE FOR HIS GRANDKIDS,

00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,391
AND HE SOLD A FEW TO, YOU KNOW,
PRESCHOOLS AND LOCAL PLACES.

00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,193
SO MY PARENTS
ACTUALLY BOUGHT ONE.

00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,262
I GREW UP
JUMPING ON THE ORIGINAL.

00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:17,297
THEN YEARS PASSED BY.

00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:20,167
ALL OF US KIDS WANTED ONE
NOW THAT WE HAVE FAMILIES.

00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:22,436
WE CONTACTED THE FARMER,
AND, SADLY, HE HAD PASSED AWAY.

00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:26,006
WE ENDED UP MANUFACTURING IT
FROM THAT POINT FORWARD.

00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,207
AND YOU OWN
THE RIGHTS TO IT?

00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,208
YES.
WE OWN THE FULL RIGHTS.

00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,242
SO YOU HAVE A PATENT

00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,444
ON THE BOUNCY, ROUND THING?

00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:32,279
WE HAVE A PROVISIONAL
THAT'S FILED.

00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:34,981
WE HAVE A UTILITY AND DESIGN
THAT ARE ALSO PENDING.

00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:37,084
AND HOW MUCH OF YOUR OWN MONEY'S
IN THIS?

00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:39,352
Rachel:
WE HAVE PUT $144,000 CASH --

00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,154
WE HAVE NO DEBT...
WOW.

00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:42,222
GOOD FOR YOU.
...OF OUR OWN
PERSONAL MONEY.

00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,390
GOOD FOR YOU.

00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,292
BUT WE HAVE TAKEN
A $70,000 SALARY.

00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:47,060
IS THIS
YOUR FULL-TIME JOBS?
Rachel: FULL TIME.

00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,295
THIS IS ALL WE DO.
WE ACTUALLY MOVED.

00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:50,030
WE DRINK, SLEEP,
AND EAT THE JUMPAROO.

00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,364
WE MOVED FOR OUR BUSINESS.
IT'S ALL WE DO.

00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:53,066
O'Leary:
I THINK IT LOOKS DANGEROUS.

00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,268
I CAN TELL YOU THIS --
WE HAD A TRAMPOLINE GROWING UP.

00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,269
WE HAD A JUMPAROO,

00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,438
AND WE HAD KIDS
COMING OVER CONSTANTLY

00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,240
BECAUSE OF THESE TWO ITEMS.

00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,110
WE HAD PLENTY OF ACCIDENTS
ON THE TRAMPOLINE.

00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,113
EVERY YEAR,
105,000 KIDS GO TO THE E.R.

00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:07,147
DUE TO TRAMPOLINE INJURIES.
TRUE.

00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:08,982
AND WHAT'S THE RECORD
ON JUMPAROOS?

00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,484
NO ONE IN 30 YEARS
EVER GOT HURT ON IT.
IT'S -- IT'S A --

00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:12,219
WELL, THEN THAT JUST MEANS
YOU HAVEN'T SOLD ENOUGH.
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?

00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:13,353
HOW MANY HAVE YOU SOLD?
[ LAUGHS ]

00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:16,323
OKAY. SO, WE'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS
FOR THE PAST 12 MONTHS,

00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:19,025
AND WE HAVE SOLD
1,200 UNITS.

00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:21,361
OKAY.
OUT OF THOSE 1,200 UNITS,
WE HAVE NOT HAD ONE CLAIM.

00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:22,996
WHAT WAS THE PRICE
YOU SOLD THEM AT?

00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:26,166
THE BIG ONE RETAILS FOR $399
ON OUR WEBSITE,

00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,268
AND THE SMALL ONE
RETAILS FOR $249.

00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,003
ARE YOU SELLING
IN RETAILERS?

00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,305
RIGHT NOW, WE TRAVEL AROUND
DIFFERENT SAM'S CLUB LOCATIONS.

00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:35,075
WE'RE THERE FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD
OF TIME, USUALLY 11 DAYS --

00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:36,343
YOU'RE DOING A ROAD SHOW.
Rachel: YES.

00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:38,078
WE'RE DOING THE ROAD SHOW
WITH SAM'S CLUB.

00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:40,280
SO, STEVE, 1,200 UNITS
YOU'VE SOLD IN 12 MONTHS.

00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,382
CORRECT.
HOW MANY OF THOSE
WERE THROUGH SAM'S CLUB,

00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,451
AND HOW MANY DID YOU SELL
OTHER WAYS?

00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,052
Steve: GREAT QUESTION.

00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,187
WE'VE SOLD 60 TOTAL
THROUGH SAM'S CLUB.

00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:48,221
WE WERE --
Herjavec: 60 UNITS?

00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:49,356
60. WE WERE IN THERE
FOR THREE WEEKS,

00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:50,991
AND WE SOLD OUT
OF PRODUCT.
OKAY.

00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:52,325
ONE QUESTION I HAVE
IS ALWAYS,

00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:55,028
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT A PRODUCT
IN A RETAIL STORE,

00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,030
SIZE OF THE PRODUCT.

00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,167
IT'S ALWAYS A PROBLEM, BECAUSE
IF THEY COULD SELL 50 THINGS

00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:02,302
IN THAT ONE SPACE
INSTEAD OF ONE THING,

00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,070
THEY'RE GONNA GO
WITH THE 50.
Steve: YEAH.

00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,340
IS THIS K.D.-ABLE --
WHICH MEANS KNOCKED DOWN --

00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,109
SO THAT YOUR BOX IS SMALL?

00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:11,244
THE BOX IS 80 INCHES LONG,
20 INCHES WIDE,

00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,079
AND 5 INCHES THICK,
AND SO --

00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,115
SO THEY DON'T BREAK DOWN,
THOSE POLES?
THEY DON'T --

00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:17,150
THE POLES DO NOT BREAK DOWN
CURRENTLY.

00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,052
SO...
THAT -- THAT'S ACTUALLY
A PRETTY BIG CHALLENGE.

00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,153
IT IS.

00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,189
BECAUSE LET'S SAY
YOU WANT TO PUT IN 20 UNITS.

00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,157
YOU'RE GONNA REQUIRE
A FAIR AMOUNT OF SPACE HERE.

00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,993
WE -- WE HAVE -- WE --
NOW, SOME OF THOSE CAN STORE
IN BACK IN THE WAREHOUSE...

00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,262
THEY CAN.
...WHICH IS WHAT
THEY'RE PROBABLY DOING.

00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:32,165
BUT TO BE IN TOYS "R" US?
I'M MORE WORRIED ABOUT
THE DISPLAY ON THE FLOOR.

00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,302
Herjavec: I LOVE TOYS.

00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:39,039
MY WIFE SAYS I'M THE OLDEST
16-YEAR-OLD SHE KNOWS.

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,075
IF I CAN PLAY WITH IT, MY KIDS
CAN PLAY WITH IT, I'LL BUY IT.

00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,978
GOT TO BE HONEST,
IT DOESN'T EXCITE ME.

00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:47,147
I'M NOT SAYING
IT'S A BAD PRODUCT.

00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:49,115
I JUST THINK MY KIDS
WOULD GET BORED WITH IT.

00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:52,319
'CAUSE WE HAVE A TRAMPOLINE.
WE'VE USED IT FOR 10 YEARS.

00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,120
Rachel: THIS IS NOT
A 15-MINUTE TOY.

00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,455
IF YOU PUT --
THIS IS A FOUR-HOUR TOY.

00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,123
PARENTS HAVE THE SAME EXPRESSION
YOU JUST DID

00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:58,258
WHERE THEY LOOK AT IT
AND THEY GO...

00:05:58,258 --> 00:05:59,392
"WHAT A DUMB IDEA."
..."I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS."

00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,127
AND THEN THEY SEE THEIR KIDS
AND GO, "I GET IT."

00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,395
I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY,
"DUMB IDEA."

00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:04,164
WE'VE HEARD IT ALL.
AND GUESS WHAT.

00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:07,167
WE HAVE NOT HAD ONE PERSON
RETURN IT.

00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,002
John:
YOU SOUND LIKE YOU'RE DOING --

00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:12,038
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE CHUGGING ALONG.
YOU'RE FIGURING IT OUT, RIGHT?
MM-HMM.

00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,273
WHY DO YOU FEEL
YOU NEED PARTNERS?

00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:16,009
OKAY.
WE SUBMITTED TO 100 STORES.

00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,278
WE JUST MET WITH SAM'S CLUB.
WE SAT DOWN WITH THE BUYER.

00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:20,146
HE'S VERY EXCITED
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,147
BUT HE ASKED US...
YEAH.

00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:24,117
SO, WE WILL --
...TO PURCHASE 11,000 UNITS.

00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:25,151
THAT'S WHY WE NEED
THE SHARKS.

00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,020
FLAT-OUT.
BECAUSE WE ARE
TALKING ABOUT --

00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,023
IF WE DO WHAT WE DID IN THE
FIRST COUPLE LOCATIONS AT SAM'S,

00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,491
IF WE DO SOMETHING
SIMILAR TO THAT,

00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:34,060
THAT'S AROUND FOUR JUMPAROOS
A DAY IN 100 LOCATIONS.

00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,129
THAT IS A $1.3 MILLION
PURCHASE ORDER.

00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:39,232
SO, RIGHT NOW YOU NEED MONEY
SO YOU CAN MANUFACTURE MORE.

00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:43,303
WHEN I FIRST STARTED, I HAD
A LITTLE EARRING ORGANIZER,

00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:45,305
AND JCPenney SAID TO ME,

00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:49,309
"LORI, IF YOU CAN GET
THE CHICAGOLAND AREA TO BUY,

00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:51,077
THEN WE'LL TAKE YOU
NATIONWIDE."

00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,246
SO EVERY WEEKEND,
I WENT TO A DIFFERENT JCPenney

00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,381
AND I STOOD THERE ALL DAY

00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:56,383
DEMONSTRATING
THE SLIDING EARRING STANDS

00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:59,119
AND SHOWING MY PRODUCT
AND PULLING PEOPLE OVER.

00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:01,288
AND IT WAS A 12-HOUR DAY
EACH DAY.

00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:03,290
AND I SOLD ENOUGH
AND I GOT IN.

00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,091
SO THERE'S TWO OF YOU.

00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,327
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO IN,
DEMONSTRATE --

00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:09,262
BRING KIDS,
JUMP UP AND DOWN.

00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,164
HOW ARE YOU GONNA
GET 100 OF YOU?

00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,000
FOR ME RIGHT NOW, I'M OUT.

00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,204
THERE'S YOUR CHALLENGE,
RIGHT?

00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,307
SO, A-AS -- AS A SELF-CONTAINED,
FROM-HOME BUSINESS,

00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:21,374
THIS IS GREAT.

00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:24,044
NOW YOU WANT TO TAKE
THAT BIG STAIR STEP.

00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:26,112
BUT MONEY
ISN'T YOUR ONLY ISSUE,

00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,315
BECAUSE ONCE
YOU'RE IN 100 STORES,

00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:31,318
THE AGGRAVATION FACTOR
GOES THROUGH THE ROOF.

00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:35,388
AND YOU WILL GET TO THE POINT
WHERE SOMEBODY GETS HURT.

00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,424
IT'S JUST INEVITABLE.

00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:39,492
THERE'S IDIOTS EVERYWHERE,
AND YOU CAN'T PROTECT

00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:42,162
AGAINST SOMEONE SPRAINING
THEIR ANKLE, BREAKING AN ANKLE.

00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:44,464
IF I'D PARTNER WITH YOU,
EVERY TIME WE SOLD ONE,

00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,133
I'D HAVE TO CROSS MY FINGERS
AND CROSS MY TOES

00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,102
THAT IT WASN'T MY KIDS
THAT BROKE THEIR ANKLE.

00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:50,403
THAT'S JUST MY NATURE.

00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:53,340
AND SO I-I DON'T SEE MYSELF
BEING A GOOD PARTNER FOR YOU,

00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,274
SO I'M OUT.

00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:58,244
THIS IS A KID MAGNET.

00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:01,314
I DON'T THINK ANY ADULT
CAN UNDERSTAND HOW FUN IT IS

00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,416
UNTIL YOU SEE YOUR KIDS
JUMPING ON IT.

00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,285
AND IT IS SAFER THAN A TRAMPO--
Herjavec:
IT -- YEAH, LISTEN TO ME.

00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:07,454
I HAVE AN IMMENSE AMOUNT
OF RESPECT

00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:13,126
OF PEOPLE THAT TAKE AN IDEA
AND CREATE A COMPANY OUT OF IT.

00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:15,061
BUT I GOT TO REALLY
BELIEVE IN THE PRODUCT.

00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:17,464
I DON'T SEE THIS
TAKING OVER THE TRAMPOLINE

00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:20,100
OR BEING A SUPPLEMENT
TO THAT BUSINESS.

00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,269
SO IT JUST --
IT DOESN'T EXCITE ME THAT WAY.

00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,270
I'M OUT.

00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,043
WHAT EXCITES ME
IS MAKING MONEY.

00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:32,278
YOU KNOW, I DON'T CARE
IF THEY'RE BOUNCING UPSIDE DOWN

00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,314
OR WHATEVER OR HANGING
LIKE A PRISONER IN A CAGE

00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,182
AS LONG AS
YOU'RE MAKING MONEY.

00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,051
[ LAUGHS ]
THAT'S ALL I CARE ABOUT.

00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:41,154
BUT TO REALLY SCALE THIS PUPPY,
YOU'VE GOT SOME BIG CHALLENGES

00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:44,057
BECAUSE OF THE FLOOR SPACE,
THE FOOTPRINT OF THE PRODUCT.

00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:45,291
I THINK THAT'LL ALWAYS LIMIT

00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:49,029
HOW MUCH YOU CAN SELL
IN ANY ONE SEASON.

00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,196
I'M OUT.

00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,465
OKAY.

00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,334
I THINK THIS TRULY
WILL TAKE A PORTION

00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,302
OF THE TRAMPOLINE MARKET.

00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,304
I'M GOING TO HIT A HOME RUN
WITH THIS.

00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:01,174
AND I AM A FIGHTER
AND I'M NOT GONNA GIVE UP.

00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,245
John: SO, RACHEL, STEVE,
I HAVE ONE QUICK QUESTION.

00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:07,013
YOU'RE MAKING IT FOR HOW MUCH,

00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,982
AND HOW MUCH
ARE YOU SELLING IT FOR?

00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:12,018
WE MANUFACTURE IT FOR $125
FOR THE LARGE ONE...

00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,053
OKAY.
...AND WE'RE CUR--

00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,320
AND THEN YOU'RE SELLING IT
TO SAM'S CLUB...

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,289
FOR $278.

00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:20,360
IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THE
100 STORES YOU'RE GOING INTO,

00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,029
THE MARGIN
IS GONNA KILL YOU.

00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,432
YOU CAME UP WITH A GREAT IDEA
OF A LOCAL PRODUCT.

00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:27,467
YOU KNOW, WHERE I CAME FROM,
WHEN WE DIDN'T HAVE A POOL,

00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:29,102
WE JUST FILLED UP
TWO GARBAGE PAILS

00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:30,303
AND PLAYED "MARCO POLO" IN THAT,
RIGHT?

00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:33,206
SO, I HAVE TO COMMEND YOU
ON THAT.
[ LAUGHS ]

00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:35,008
BUT OTHER THAN THAT,

00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:38,411
THE FINANCES DON'T WORK IN THIS
FOR YOU TO HAVE A PARTNER.

00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,979
SO I'M OUT.

00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,948
OKAY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,116
Herjavec: THANK YOU.
APPRECIATE IT.

00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:44,150
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
John: GOOD LUCK.

00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,151
THANK YOU.
CONGRATS.
THANK YOU.

00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:47,020
[ SNAPS FINGERS ]

00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,121
[ CHUCKLES ]

00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:49,255
[ GROANS ]

00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,356
Steve: I'M DISAPPOINTED.

00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,258
I'M FRUSTRATED
THAT THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT.

00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,128
I REALLY FELT LIKE
THIS WAS OUR BIG OPPORTUNITY

00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:58,164
AND OUR BIG CHANCE TO REALLY
TAKE IT TO THAT NEXT LEVEL

00:09:58,164 --> 00:09:59,432
LIKE DAYMOND TALKED ABOUT.

00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:04,237
AND IT'S FRUSTRATING
TO HIT A WALL.

00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,247
I'M MEGHAN TARMEY.

00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:16,116
I'M FROM MYRTLE BEACH,
SOUTH CAROLINA.

00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,117
NICE SHOT.

00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,085
MY COMPANY IS CALLED
THE CADDY GIRLS.

00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,287
IT'S THE FIRST ALL-FEMALE
GOLF-CADDYING COMPANY.

00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,456
WE PROVIDE THE REFRESHING
COMPANY OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,025
THAT IS ALSO A GREAT CADDY.

00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,161
WE DRIVE THE CART,
KEEP THE SCORE,

00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:31,030
TEND THE PIN, RAKE SAND TRAPS,
READ THE GREENS.

00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,432
AND ON TOP OF THAT,
WE'RE YOUR PERSONAL CHEERLEADERS

00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:34,134
TO DO BACKFLIPS
FOR WHEN YOU GET BIRDIES.

00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,169
YES!
THERE WE GO!

00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:38,304
I CAME UP WITH MY BUSINESS
BACK WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE.

00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,306
I LEARNED EVERYTHING
THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT GOLF

00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,308
AND I STARTED CADDYING
AT ALL THE LOCAL COURSES.

00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,043
THE CONCEPT
WAS AN IMMEDIATE HIT,

00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,179
AND NOW I HAVE A STAFF
OF OVER 70 GIRLS,

00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,948
AND WE WORK EVENTS AND
TOURNAMENTS FROM COAST TO COAST.

00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:51,184
THE GIRLS WILL BE THERE
20 MINUTES BEFORE YOUR TEE TIME.

00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:53,319
I AM COMPLETELY IMMERSED
IN HUSTLING EVERY SINGLE DAY

00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,221
TO GET THIS COMPANY
OFF THE GROUND.

00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:58,158
BUT THE MONEY THAT I'M MAKING
OFF OF MY COMPANY RIGHT NOW

00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,027
IS NOT ENOUGH TO LIVE OFF OF
AND EXPAND MY BUSINESS.

00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,228
I NEED AN INVESTMENT
FROM THE SHARKS

00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,164
TO TAKE THE MODEL THAT I HAVE
HERE IN MYRTLE BEACH

00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,166
TO EVERY OTHER MAJOR GOLF MARKET
IN AMERICA.

00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,300
WITH THE RIGHT SHARK,

00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,135
I KNOW THAT MY BUSINESS
COULD BE A HOLE IN ONE.

00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:30,056
HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS MEGHAN TARMEY.

00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,457
I'M FROM MYRTLE BEACH,
SOUTH CAROLINA,

00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,092
AND MY COMPANY IS...

00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:35,228
THE CADDY GIRLS.

00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:39,232
I'M SEEKING $100,000 IN EXCHANGE
FOR 20% OF MY COMPANY.

00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:40,300
SO, THE CADDY GIRLS

00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,135
IS AN ALL-FEMALE
GOLF-CADDYING COMPANY.

00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:45,004
WE STAFF EVERYTHING
FROM EVERYDAY GOLF OUTINGS

00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,439
TO HUGE CORPORATE
CHARITY TOURNAMENTS

WITH MY AMAZING,
GOLF-KNOWLEDGEABLE,

00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,043
AND ATTRACTIVE CADDIES.

00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:53,146
WE TRY TO EMPHASIZE
THE FUN FACTOR OF GOLF,

00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:54,214
BUT WE ALSO MAINTAIN

00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,149
A VERY PROFESSIONAL ATTITUDE
ABOUT GOLF.

00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:58,284
SHARKS, MY COMPANY
IS A HOLE IN ONE.

00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:02,021
SO WHICH ONE OF YOU
IS GONNA HELP ME...

00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:04,090
DRIVE MY COMPANY
TO THE GREEN?

00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,426
I'M CURIOUS.
WHERE DO YOU DO THIS?

00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:09,062
WE'RE BASED OUT OF
MYRTLE BEACH, SOUTH CAROLINA,

00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,263
BUT WE'VE ACTUALLY
BEEN EXPANDING

00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:12,465
TO OTHER MAJOR GOLF MARKETS,
SUCH AS SCOTTSDALE.

00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:16,436
WE EVEN HAVE CADDY GIRLS NOW
IN LOS ANGELES, MIAMI, ORLANDO,

00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:17,971
AND PARTS OF GEORGIA.

00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:19,072
MEGHAN, HOW BIG
IS YOUR BUSINESS?

00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,073
WHAT ARE YOUR REVENUES?

00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:24,143
IN 2013,
I HAD $148,000 IN SALES.

00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:25,078
GOOD FOR YOU.

00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,112
GOOD.
O'Leary: THAT'S NOT BAD.

00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,314
WE DID $34,000
IN SALES LAST MONTH.

00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,383
WHAT'S THE MAIN BULK
OF YOUR BUSINESS?

00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:33,119
IT COULD BE AN EVERYDAY
GOLF OUTING WITH FOUR GUYS.

00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,054
IT COULD BE A HUGE GOLF OUTING

00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,123
WITH 144 PLAYERS
IN A TOURNAMENT.

00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:39,192
WE'VE HAD
HUGE CORPORATE CLIENTS

00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:40,460
ACTUALLY HIRE UP TO 42 CADDIES
IN ONE DAY.

00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,061
O'Leary:
GIVE US THE NUMBERS.

00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,230
I CALL YOU UP.
I'VE GOT A CORPORATE EVENT.

00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,299
AND I WANT TO HIRE CADDIES
FOR EVERYBODY.

00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:50,103
THE LOWEST RATE THAT WE HAVE FOR
EACH CADDY IS $149 PER CADDY.

00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,105
WELL, YOU GET $149.
NOW, WHAT DO YOU PAY THEM?

00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,040
I PAY EVERY CADDY $100.

00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,308
Greiner: IS THAT FOR 9 HOLES?
18 HOLES?

00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:56,976
18 HOLES.
18 HOLES.

00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,111
9 HOLES IS $89.

00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,079
MEGHAN, HOW'D YOU COME UP
WITH THE IDEA?

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,115
I WAS, HONESTLY, IN COLLEGE
AND COMPLETELY BROKE.

00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,383
I WAS BARTENDING
IN MYRTLE BEACH,

00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:05,285
WHERE THERE'S
A HUNDRED GOLF COURSES,

00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,220
AND I NOTICED
THAT I REALLY LIKED GOLFERS.

00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,489
THEY TIPPED THE BEST, AND ONE
GROUP CAME UP TO ME ONE NIGHT,

00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:12,425
AND THEY'RE LIKE, "HEY,
WE WANT YOU TO COME
GOLF WITH US TOMORROW.

00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:14,260
WE'LL PAY YOU."
AND I'M LIKE, "THAT'S WEIRD."

00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,428
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT HERE'S THE THING --

00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:17,230
A LIGHT BULB WENT OF,
AND I WAS LIKE,

00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,099
"YOU KNOW, IT WOULD BE
REALLY AWESOME IF I
MAKE MY OWN SCHEDULE.

00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,301
"I WANT TO BE
OUT ON THE GOLF COURSE

00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,036
AND TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THIS MARKET."

00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:27,206
MEGHAN, TAKE THIS QUESTION
THE ABSOLUTE MOST INNOCENT WAY.

00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:28,441
MOST GUYS ARE PIGS.

00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:31,077
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF,

00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:32,378
WHEN THEY'RE HIRING
THE BEAUTIFUL LADIES --

00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:34,147
I DON'T MEAN THIS
IN A DISRESPECTFUL WAY --

00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:37,183
ARE THEY HIRING THEM FOR GOLF,
OR IS IT JUST A FUN THING?

00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,318
WE ARE NOT PEOPLE TO COME

00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,053
AND GET HIRED TO HANG OUT
WITH GUYS, OKAY?

00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:41,154
LIKE, OUR WHOLE NICHE

00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,122
IS THAT WE ARE HOT GIRLS
THAT KNOW ABOUT GOLF.

00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,291
DO YOU DO TRADITIONAL
CADDY THINGS?

00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,427
YES. WE'RE GETTING YOUR CLUBS
TO AND FROM YOU.

00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:49,495
WE'RE FIXING PITCH MARKS.
WE'RE RAKING EVERY SAND TRAP.

00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,463
WE'RE TENDING THE PIN.

00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,298
WE'RE HELPING YOU
GET YOUR YARDAGE.

00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:55,001
EVERYTHING THAT A CADDY
WOULD NORMALLY DO, WE DO THAT.

00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,402
WE JUST HAD FOUR OF OUR GIRLS
CONTRACTED

00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,404
FOR THE PGA-SANCTIONED
NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP

00:13:58,404 --> 00:13:59,439
COMING UP IN TWO WEEKS.

00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,040
THAT'S GONNA BE TELEVISED.

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,342
FOUR OF MY GIRLS
ARE CARRYING BAGS.

00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:06,179
HOW DO YOU MAKE THIS MORE THAN
A REGIONALLY BASED BUSINESS?

00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:09,415
A STANDARD GOLF TOURNAMENT
HAS 144 PLAYERS.

00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:10,983
THAT'S 144 PEOPLE THAT GO HOME

00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,218
AND TELL THEIR GOLF BUDDIES
ABOUT IT,

00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,386
AND THEN IT'S JUST --
IT SPREADS.

00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:17,090
HALF OF OUR BUSINESS THIS YEAR
WAS REPEAT BUSINESS.

00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,224
AND BIG CORPORATE TOURNAMENTS,

00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,493
WE ALREADY HAVE SOME LINED UP
THROUGH DECEMBER.

00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:23,062
AND THIS IS NOT JUST, LIKE,
ONE OR TWO GIRLS GOING OUT.

00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:25,098
THIS IS 30 TO 40 GIRLS
GOING OUT, YOU KNOW, IN ONE DAY.

00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:27,400
$100,000 FOR 20%.

00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,435
YOU THINK THIS IS WORTH
HALF A MILLION BUCKS?

00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:32,205
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT
THE LIFETIME CUSTOMER VALUE.

00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,406
GOLF ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE.

00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,408
THE USE OF ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE
ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE.

00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:38,211
AND WE HAVE A DATABASE
OF THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMERS

00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,079
THAT HAVE USED US
IN THE PAST.

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,147
EVERYTHING'S GREAT.

00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:42,415
I HAVE 70 GIRLS WORKING,
BOOKINGS EVERY DAY.

00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:45,051
I WANT TO TAKE THAT
AND EXPAND THAT TO OTHER PLACES.

00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,053
BUT WE ALSO HAVE PEOPLE
ASKING FOR CADDIES

00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,154
IN CHICAGO, MINNEAPOLIS --

00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:50,223
ALL THESE AREAS
THAT I WOULD LOVE TO GET INTO.

00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:53,459
Greiner:
YOU KNOW, FOR ME, I JUST SEE
SO MANY ISSUES OR PROBLEMS

00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:56,062
THAT I COULD FORESEE HAPPENING
WITH THIS.

00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:59,098
IT WORRIES ME SOMETIMES,
JUST FOR YOU GUYS, PERIOD,

00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:01,067
TO BE OUT THERE WITH
THE DRINKING AND THIS AND THAT.

00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:04,070
I -- IT'S JUST NOT A BUSINESS
I COULD GET BEHIND.

00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,039
SO FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.

00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,008
I UNDERSTAND.

00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:12,245
AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE VERY,
VERY STRICT STANDARDS OF CONDUCT

00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,279
FOR ALL OF OUR CADDIES.

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,981
AND I THINK WITH ANY JOB PLACE,

00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:17,049
YOU HAVE A LIABILITY
FOR ANY KIND OF HARASSMENT

00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,084
OR ANYTHING THAT CAN GO ON.

00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,352
IT CAN HAPPEN ANYWHERE.

00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:21,220
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
MEGHAN, LET ME --
LET ME JUMP IN HERE.

00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,091
I THINK YOU CAN TURN THIS
INTO SOMETHING SPECIAL.

00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,193
BUT I HATE GOLF,
SO I'M OUT.

00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:28,428
[ LAUGHS ]

00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,062
WE COULD MAKE YOU LIKE GOLF
A LITTLE BIT MORE.

00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:31,330
MAYBE IF YOU HAD A CADDY GIRL
WITH YOU, YOU'D LIKE IT.

00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,299
THIS IS SUPER FUN.
Cuban: I CAN THINK OF
A HUNDRED THOUSAND THINGS

00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:38,137
I WOULD RATHER DO THAN
SCHLEP AROUND A GOLF COURSE.

00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,440
John: YOU KNOW, JUST LIKE MARK,
I-I DON'T LIKE GOLF.

00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,442
BUT I-I LIKE THE CONCEPT.

00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,178
I THINK YOU'RE IN
A TOUGH POSITION,

00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:48,414
BECAUSE, FIRST OF ALL,
YOU DO NEED TO EXPAND

00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,349
BECAUSE SOMEBODY ELSE WILL TRY
TO COME UP WITH THE IDEA

00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,051
AND BE YOUR COMPETITION.

00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:55,288
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND,
YOU SPREAD YOURSELF TOO THIN...

00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,423
YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE
ENOUGH MONEY IN EACH MARKET.

00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:00,460
I THINK THERE'S
TOO MUCH WORK HERE.

00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,296
SO I'D HAVE TO BE OUT.

00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:06,232
THANK YOU.

00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:08,301
Herjavec: SO, I-I THINK
YOU'VE GOT A GREAT BUSINESS.

00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,969
YOU'VE BUILT IT
FROM NOTHING.

00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:13,072
BUT EVERY BUSINESS IS A LIVING,
BREATHING THING,

00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:15,374
AND IT GOES THROUGH
DIFFERENT STAGES.

00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:18,044
THERE'S THE HUSTLE STAGE,

00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:21,214
WHERE YOU NEED MORE HUSTLE,
MORE TIME,

00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:24,283
AND YOU JUST GOT TO FIND MORE
HOURS THAN THE 24 YOU'RE GIVEN.

00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:29,155
AND THEN SOME BUSINESSES
GET TO THE INVESTMENT STAGE.

00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,257
YOU'RE IN THE HUSTLE STAGE.

00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:33,159
I DON'T --
YOU DIDN'T
DO A GOOD JOB TODAY

00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:36,329
OF TELLING ME HOW,
AS AN INVESTOR,

00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:39,265
I GIVE YOU $100,000 AND YOU
MAKE THE BUSINESS GO BOOM.

00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:41,167
YOU GOT LOTS OF HUSTLE.

00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,135
I WAS --
SO KEEP GOING.

00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,303
BUT I'M OUT.

HE'S OUR IDEAL CUSTOMER.
HE'S PERFECT. SHOWS UP GRUMPY.

AND HE'S SUPER HAPPY.
[ LAUGHTER ]

HE'S GRUMPY ALL THE TIME.

00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,352
I ACTUALLY --
I'M VERY IMPRESSED WITH YOU

00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,454
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
THIS PRESENTATION

00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:03,422
WAS GOING TO BE
JUST RIDICULOUS.

00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,057
AND YOU COME BACK...

00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:06,092
DID A GOOD JOB.
...AND DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB.

00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:07,026
YEAH.
YOU DID.

00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:07,493
SO GOOD FOR YOU.

00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:10,263
BUT, YOU KNOW,
IS IT INVESTABLE?

00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:13,266
I GIVE YOU $100,000, I DON'T
KNOW HOW I EVER GET IT BACK.

00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:14,367
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,370
AT OUR GROWTH RATE OF 30%
EVERY YEAR AS AN AVERAGE,

00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,106
YOU WOULD GET IT BACK
WITHIN FOUR YEARS EASILY.

00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:22,074
THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS
IN BUSINESS IS CASH.

00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,243
WHEN IT LEAVES -- AND RIGHT NOW
IT'S AROUND MY ANKLE GOING,

00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:27,380
"DADDY, NO! DADDY, NO!" --
AND I GIVE IT TO YOU...

00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,347
Greiner: [ LAUGHS ]

00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:29,382
...NOW IT'S REALLY SCARED

00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,250
'CAUSE IT DOESN'T KNOW
WHEN IT'S COMING HOME.

00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,085
I WOULD -- I WOULD IDEALLY
LIKE TO PAY YOU BACK

00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:35,054
BY THE END OF THE YEAR
AND THEN HAVE YOU AS A PARTNER.

00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,255
I'VE NEVER MARKETED THIS.

00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,025
IF WE HAD A BOOTH AT THE PGA
SHOW IN ORLANDO EVERY YEAR,

00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:41,260
FORGET IT -- OUR BOOKINGS
WOULD BE THROUGH THE ROOF.

00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,428
ALL RIGHT.
I'VE HEARD ENOUGH.

00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,063
I'M GONNA
MAKE YOU AN OFFER.

00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,033
THE ONLY WAY THIS WORKS
IS VERY SIMPLE.

00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:50,303
I GIVE YOU $100,000.
I BECOME A 50/50 PARTNER.

00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:54,974
AND THE REASON YOU WOULD DO THIS
IS ONLY IF YOU BELIEVED

00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:58,177
YOU COULD MORE THAN DOUBLE
YOUR BUSINESS WITH MY $100,000.

00:17:58,177 --> 00:17:59,378
I CAN GUARANTEE YOU
THE DEVIL

00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,380
WOULD GIVE YOU A BETTER DEAL
THAN KEVIN.

NOT THAT BAD A DEAL, RIGHT?

00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,017
BECAUSE YOU --
IT'S A HORRIBLE DEAL.

00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,218
IT'S A HORRIBLE DEAL.
IT'S NOT THAT BAD A DEAL.

ISN'T TALK CHEAP, MEGHAN?

THE ONLY SHARK THAT BELIEVED
IN YOU IS MR. WONDERFUL.

00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:11,090
THAT'S IT.

00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,092

YOU CAN MORE THAN DOUBLE IT,

00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,465
DON'T DO THIS DEAL.

ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT?
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO GIVE YOU HALF.

00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:26,038

NEVER.

MAKE A DECISION.

I JUST THINK, AT THIS TIME,

00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:39,485
50% IS TOO -- TOO MUCH
FOR WHAT I'VE PUT INTO IT.

00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,454

RIGHT. AND THAT'S ACTUALLY
HOW THE CUSTOMER --
SO YOU'RE CURATING THE LOOK
OF THIS PERSON.

00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,343
I AM CURATING THE LOOK.

00:21:15,343 --> 00:21:16,577
IF I WAS TO SELECT THIS,

00:21:16,577 --> 00:21:18,346
WOULD IT AUTOMATICALLY SUGGEST
THAT I BUY THE REST OF THIS?

00:21:18,346 --> 00:21:19,780
IT WOULD.

00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,517
DIANA, WHAT IS THE AVERAGE BUY
FROM A WOMAN ONLINE?

00:21:22,517 --> 00:21:23,551
$75 PER ORDER.

00:21:23,551 --> 00:21:24,619
PER -- PER PURCHASE?
PER PURCHASE.

00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:25,586
PER PURCHASE.

00:21:25,586 --> 00:21:26,754
AND HOW OFTEN
DO THEY RE-ORDER

00:21:26,754 --> 00:21:28,422
THROUGHOUT
A 12-MONTH PERIOD?

00:21:28,422 --> 00:21:29,657
WE HAVE A LOT
OF RETURN CUSTOMERS

00:21:29,657 --> 00:21:31,759
THAT ORDER, ON AVERAGE,
ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN TIMES A YEAR.

00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:33,828
WE ALSO HAVE -- WE'RE GETTING
NEW CUSTOMERS ALL THE TIME.

00:21:33,828 --> 00:21:35,830
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES
LAST YEAR?

00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,598
$8 MILLION
IN GROSS SALES.

00:21:37,598 --> 00:21:39,433
Cuban: GOOD FOR YOU.

00:21:39,433 --> 00:21:40,801
AND WE'RE ON TARGET
TO DO $12 MILLION

00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:42,336
TO $15 MILLION THIS YEAR.

00:21:42,336 --> 00:21:44,438
WOW.
HOW LONG YOU BEEN IN BUSINESS?

00:21:44,438 --> 00:21:45,740
THE WEBSITE'S ONLY 4.

00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,508
FOUR YEARS?
4 YEARS OLD.

00:21:47,508 --> 00:21:48,509
WOW.

00:21:48,509 --> 00:21:50,578
WHAT ARE THE SALES
THE FIRST YEAR?

00:21:50,578 --> 00:21:54,448
2010, VERY MODEST,
$80,000.

00:21:54,448 --> 00:21:56,317
2011, $250,000.

00:21:56,317 --> 00:21:58,452
2012, $1.8 MILLION.

00:21:58,452 --> 00:21:59,654
WHAT WAS 113?

00:21:59,654 --> 00:22:01,589
113 WAS $7.5 MILLION.

00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:03,624
WHAT WILL SALES BE
THIS YEAR?

00:22:03,624 --> 00:22:05,526
PROJECTING $12 MILLION
TO $15 MILLION.
WELL, WE'RE DOING
$1 MILLION A MONTH.

00:22:05,526 --> 00:22:07,528
I'M REALLY PROUD
OF RED DRESS.

00:22:07,528 --> 00:22:09,497
CONGRATULATIONS.
IT'S A REALLY FUN STORY,

00:22:09,497 --> 00:22:11,432
BECAUSE WE WERE MARRIED
FOR SIX MONTHS.

00:22:11,432 --> 00:22:12,700
AND GRO--
WE'RE FRESH OUT OF COLLEGE

00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,402
AND WE WERE WORKING
CUBICLE JOBS

00:22:14,402 --> 00:22:15,636
AT A CREDIT-CARD-PROCESSING
COMPANY.

00:22:15,636 --> 00:22:17,772
AND I CAME UP WITH THE RED DRESS
IN THE CUBICLE,

00:22:17,772 --> 00:22:19,574
AND I WENT TO JOSH
AND I SAID,

00:22:19,574 --> 00:22:21,509
"I HAVE THIS GREAT IDEA
FOR A BOUTIQUE

00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:22,677
AND I KNOW I CAN DO THIS."

00:22:22,677 --> 00:22:25,813
SO WE BOTH ENDED UP QUITTING
OUR CUBICLE JOBS, AGE 24,

00:22:25,813 --> 00:22:28,349
SOLD OUR HOUSE,
TOOK OUT A SIX-FIGURE LOAN

00:22:28,349 --> 00:22:29,750
WE HAD NO IDEA
IF WE COULD EVER REPAY.

00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,686
AND WE RENTED AN AIR MATTRESS
AND SHACKED UP

00:22:31,686 --> 00:22:34,622
WITH RA-- JOSH'S COLLEGE BUDDIES
FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR.

00:22:34,622 --> 00:22:41,429
HOW DID YOU MAKE THIS GROW
SO BIG SO FAST AND ALL ONLINE?

00:22:41,429 --> 00:22:42,597
THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA.

00:22:42,597 --> 00:22:45,700
BUT MORE THAN THAT,
IT'S BECAUSE I INVITE PEOPLE IN.

00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,501
I PUT THE QUESTION
TO MY CUSTOMERS --

00:22:47,501 --> 00:22:49,337
I WAS LIKE,
"WHAT MADE Y'ALL COME TO ME?

00:22:49,337 --> 00:22:50,805
WHAT MAKES US --
WHAT MAKES RED DRESS SPECIAL?"

00:22:50,805 --> 00:22:53,441
AND THEY GAVE
AMAZING ANSWERS

00:22:53,441 --> 00:22:55,376
AND SAID, "OH,
IT'S THE COLORFUL CLOTHES."

00:22:55,376 --> 00:22:57,645
"IT'S THE FACT THAT WE CAN GET
A HIGH-END LOOK FOR UNDER $50."

00:22:57,645 --> 00:22:59,447
"IT'S --"
SO, YOU LEARNED FROM THEM.

00:22:59,447 --> 00:23:00,781
YES.
YOU USED SOCIAL MEDIA...

00:23:00,781 --> 00:23:02,617
I DID.

00:23:02,617 --> 00:23:04,452
...AND YOU KEPT PERFECTING YOUR
BUSINESS WITH THEIR ANSWERS.

00:23:04,452 --> 00:23:07,488
I DID. I DEVELOPED A PROGRAM
CALLED BUY FOR THE BOUTIQUE.

00:23:07,488 --> 00:23:09,724
AND WHEN I GO TO MY MARKETS --
I GO EVERY THREE WEEKS.

00:23:09,724 --> 00:23:11,592
I GO TO LOS ANGELES,
I GO TO VEGAS,

00:23:11,592 --> 00:23:14,495
I GO TO ATLANTA,
AND I CURATE.

00:23:14,495 --> 00:23:16,397
BUT MORE THAN THAT,
I SEE ITEMS,

00:23:16,397 --> 00:23:18,633
AND I WILL TAKE A PICTURE OF IT
WITH MY PHONE,

00:23:18,633 --> 00:23:21,435
AND I WILL THROW IT OUT
INTO SOCIAL MEDIA AND SAY,

00:23:21,435 --> 00:23:22,536
"DO YOU LOVE THIS?
YES OR NO?

00:23:22,536 --> 00:23:24,405
"DO YOU WANT IT IN RED?
OHH.

00:23:24,405 --> 00:23:25,506
"DO YOU WANT IT IN BLUE?"
VERY, VERY CLEVER.

00:23:25,506 --> 00:23:26,641
OKAY.

00:23:26,641 --> 00:23:28,676
AND NO ONE HAD EVER DONE THAT
BEFORE, AND THEY LOVED IT.

00:23:28,676 --> 00:23:31,712
IT WAS ALL WORD OF MOUTH
GAVE YOU A 4X GROWTH?
YES.

00:23:31,712 --> 00:23:34,649
WE HAVE 127,000
INSTAGRAM FOLLOWERS.

00:23:34,649 --> 00:23:36,651
WE ARE JUST SHY OF A MILLION
FOLLOWERS ON FACEBOOK --

00:23:36,651 --> 00:23:37,685
ORGANIC FOLLOWERS.

00:23:37,685 --> 00:23:40,554
YOU WENT FROM $1.8 MILLION
TO $7.5 MILLION.

00:23:40,554 --> 00:23:41,822
THAT'S PHENOMENAL.

00:23:41,822 --> 00:23:44,425
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN
IN THAT TIME PERIOD?

00:23:44,425 --> 00:23:46,360
YES.

00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,563
MY DAD ACTUALLY DIED
IN OCTOBER OF 2012.
OH, I'M SORRY.

00:23:49,563 --> 00:23:52,633
MY DAD WAS THE PERSON
WHO GOT ME STARTED ON RED DRESS

00:23:52,633 --> 00:23:54,435
JUST BY BEING A MENTOR.

00:23:54,435 --> 00:23:58,506
AND SO I TOOK MY GRIEF
AND I USED IT AS FUEL

00:23:58,506 --> 00:24:01,542
TO PUSH RED DRESS AS FAR
AS I COULD GET IT TO GO.

00:24:01,542 --> 00:24:02,677
THAT'S MY MOTIVATOR.

00:24:02,677 --> 00:24:04,612
AND THAT'S A MOTIVATOR
THAT WOULD DIE WITH ME,

00:24:04,612 --> 00:24:09,483
BECAUSE I LIVE EVERY DAY
TO KEEP MAKING HIM PROUD.

00:24:09,483 --> 00:24:10,584
HE CALLED ME HIS ACORN.

00:24:10,584 --> 00:24:13,454
Greiner: AWW.

00:24:13,454 --> 00:24:15,456
O'Leary:
SO, ON THAT $13 MILLION,

00:24:15,456 --> 00:24:18,859
HOW MUCH FREE CASH
ARE YOU GOING TO NET?

00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:21,529
PROBABLY $2 MILLION
IN NET PROFIT.

00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:24,765
WHAT DO YOU RECKON IT COSTS YOU
TO GET A NEW CUSTOMER?

00:24:24,765 --> 00:24:28,669
WE'VE JUST NOW STARTED TO GET
INTO REALLY THOROUGH ANALYTICS,

00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:31,405
AND IT TAKES TIME
TO ACCRUE THAT DATA.

00:24:31,405 --> 00:24:32,807
SO YOU'VE HAD
THIS PHENOMENAL GROWTH

00:24:32,807 --> 00:24:35,676
ON WORD OF MOUTH
AND VIRAL ASPECTS.
YES.

00:24:35,676 --> 00:24:38,813
WHEN YOU GET TO, YOU KNOW,
$10 MILLION

00:24:38,813 --> 00:24:40,781
AND YOU WANT TO GET
TO $20 MILLION...
MM-HMM.

00:24:40,781 --> 00:24:42,383
...YOU'RE GONNA
START TO COMPETE

00:24:42,383 --> 00:24:43,584
WITH SOME PRETTY HEAVY HITTERS
IN THIS SPACE.

00:24:43,584 --> 00:24:45,553
YES, WE ARE.

00:24:45,553 --> 00:24:46,687
THEY'RE SPENDING
A LOT OF MONEY

00:24:46,687 --> 00:24:48,389
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
THE INCREMENTAL COST

00:24:48,389 --> 00:24:50,358
OF EVERY NEW CUSTOMER
AND THE LIFETIME VALUE.

00:24:50,358 --> 00:24:52,626
WE'VE JUST NOW STARTED ROLLING
OUT THE RE-TARGETING ADS.

00:24:52,626 --> 00:24:54,762
THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT
HAS BEEN REALLY GREAT FOR US.

00:24:54,762 --> 00:24:57,598
AND WE'RE JUST NOW GETTING BACK
THE DATA ON THAT.

00:24:57,598 --> 00:24:59,667
I'D LIKE TO DRAW
AN ANALOGY.

00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:02,737
THERE'S A GREAT STORY IN FASHION
AROUND VIDAL SASSOON,

00:25:02,737 --> 00:25:06,540
WHO WAS THE FIRST TO CURATE HAIR
FOR WOMEN.

00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,675
BUT WHEN THEY TRIED
TO EXPAND,

00:25:07,675 --> 00:25:09,543
THEY FOUND OUT THAT
THEY COULDN'T CLONE HIM.

00:25:09,543 --> 00:25:12,580
AND HE TRIED TO TRAIN PEOPLE
IN EVERY CITY TO DO THIS,

00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,415
AND THEY HAD
HORRIFIC PROBLEMS.

00:25:14,415 --> 00:25:16,751
I'M VERY WORRIED HERE.

00:25:16,751 --> 00:25:20,421
TO ME, THE ROAD AHEAD IS --
IS ONE

00:25:20,421 --> 00:25:22,790
WHERE YOU'RE GONNA FACE
THE SAME ISSUE SASSOON FACED.

00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,625
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
CLONE YOURSELF,

00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:25,726
AND IT'S NOT EASY TO DO.

00:25:25,726 --> 00:25:27,828
IT'S NOT EASY TO DO,
BUT I HAVE STARTED THE PROCESS.

00:25:27,828 --> 00:25:29,730
TO ME, THAT'S A RISK
THAT I DON'T WANT TO TAKE.

00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:30,798
I'M OUT.

00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:32,767
KEVIN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR YOUR TIME.

00:25:32,767 --> 00:25:33,701
THANK YOU.

00:25:33,701 --> 00:25:35,703
I'M EXTREMELY
IMPRESSED BY YOU.

00:25:35,703 --> 00:25:37,738
YOU CALLED YOURSELF
AN ACORN,

00:25:37,738 --> 00:25:41,742
AND I SEE YOU'VE GROWN INTO,
LIKE, A MOUNTAIN FULL OF TREES.

00:25:41,742 --> 00:25:42,810
YOU'RE AMAZING.

00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:45,546
AND WHAT YOU DID
WITH SOCIAL MEDIA, TO ME,

00:25:45,546 --> 00:25:47,715
JUST IS MIND-BOGGLING
AND INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVE.

00:25:47,715 --> 00:25:49,417
THANK YOU.

00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:52,653
I ACTUALLY COULD LEARN FROM <i>YOU</i>
IN THE SOCIAL-MEDIA REALM

00:25:52,653 --> 00:25:55,389
OF HOW YOU HAVE GROWN
YOUR BUSINESS.

00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:59,527
BUT I THINK THAT I'M NOT
THE RIGHT SHARK FOR YOU

00:25:59,527 --> 00:26:01,595
TO DRIVE THIS BUSINESS.

00:26:01,595 --> 00:26:03,697
SO FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.

00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:08,636
YOU KNOW, THIS REMINDS ME
OF THE WAY I STARTED WITH FUBU.

00:26:08,636 --> 00:26:10,571
I WAS JUST TALKING DIRECTLY
TO THE CUSTOMER,

00:26:10,571 --> 00:26:12,640
AND NOBODY ELSE
KNEW HOW TO DO IT.

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,542
AND THAT'S HOW I GOT HERE.

00:26:14,542 --> 00:26:18,679
YOU GUYS ARE THE FUBU
OF YOUR CATEGORY.

00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:21,582
I'M -- PROBABLY LIKE LORI,
I'D BE LEARNING FROM YOU.

00:26:21,582 --> 00:26:23,617
YOU'RE HERE
FOR A STRATEGIC PARTNER.

00:26:23,617 --> 00:26:26,787
I WISH I COULD HELP YOU,
BUT I CAN'T.

00:26:26,787 --> 00:26:27,822
SO I'M OUT.

00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:33,494
WHY DO YOU NEED $600,000?
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

00:26:33,494 --> 00:26:34,728
MARK, YOU'VE SAID
IN INTERVIEWS

00:26:34,728 --> 00:26:37,498
THAT Y-YOU REALLY WANT
TO BE NEEDED BUT NOT NECESSARY.

00:26:37,498 --> 00:26:38,866
THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

00:26:38,866 --> 00:26:40,501
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE

00:26:40,501 --> 00:26:42,603
WHO CAN HELP US
WALK THROUGH THE HIGH --

00:26:42,603 --> 00:26:45,539
SOME HIGH-LEVEL DECISIONS
TO GET US TO THAT NEXT LEVEL,

00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:47,608
BECAUSE EVERY ONE OF YOU
IS HERE RIGHT NOW

00:26:47,608 --> 00:26:49,743
BECAUSE, AT SOME POINT,
YOU TOOK A SMALL COMPANY

00:26:49,743 --> 00:26:51,545
AND YOU SCALED IT
TO A MASSIVE COMPANY.

00:26:51,545 --> 00:26:54,615
WE HAVE FIGURED OUT HOW TO GROW
A COMPANY FROM NOTHING

00:26:54,615 --> 00:26:56,717
TO OVER $1 MILLION A MONTH
IN SALES.

00:26:56,717 --> 00:26:58,586
BUT GETTING
TO NINE FIGURES A YEAR,

00:26:58,586 --> 00:26:59,820
IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT THING.

00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:03,457
Diana: IT TAKES A MENTOR
WHO'S WALKED THE PATH BEFORE US.

00:27:03,457 --> 00:27:08,696
AND THE $600,000, WE NEED
$300,000 OF IT FOR A NEW WEBSITE

00:27:08,696 --> 00:27:10,764
BECAUSE WE HAVE ACTUALLY
MAXED OUT THE CAPACITY

00:27:10,764 --> 00:27:12,766
OF THE OUT-OF-THE-BOX SYSTEM
THAT WE HAVE.

00:27:12,766 --> 00:27:15,402
AND A BACK-END SYSTEM
FOR OUR WEBSITE.

00:27:15,402 --> 00:27:18,806
IT REALLY IS GIVING US NOT VERY
GOOD BUSINESS DATA AT ALL.

00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:22,810
Herjavec: THAT'S MY WORLD.

00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:27,648
ANALYTICS,
ENTERPRISE TYPE OF INFORMATION,

00:27:27,648 --> 00:27:29,416
THAT'S WHERE I LIVE
EVERY DAY.

00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:30,551
TO BE HONEST,
THAT'S WHERE I'M WEAK.

00:27:30,551 --> 00:27:32,620
WELL, THAT -- THAT'S WHERE
I'M VERY, VERY STRONG.

00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,755
I THINK I CAN ADD A LOT OF VALUE
ON THE BACK END,

00:27:34,755 --> 00:27:36,824
WHICH IS WHAT I THINK
YOU NEED RIGHT NOW.

00:27:36,824 --> 00:27:40,828
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $600,000
FOR 15%.

00:27:40,828 --> 00:27:42,796
FIRST OF ALL,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:27:42,796 --> 00:27:45,599
THAT'S A HUGE GESTURE OF FAITH
IN WHAT WE'RE DOING.

00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:50,504
RIGHT NOW, I THINK 15%
IS A LITTLE MORE EQUITY

00:27:50,504 --> 00:27:52,673
THAN WE WERE PLANNING ON
GIVING UP FOR THAT VALUATION.

00:27:52,673 --> 00:27:54,742
RESPECTFULLY,
WE DO HAVE TO DECLINE THAT.

00:27:54,742 --> 00:27:56,610
RESPECTFULLY,
I'M GONNA STAY THERE.

00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:58,646
THANK YOU.

00:28:00,548 --> 00:28:01,649
I LOVE YOU GUYS, RIGHT?

00:28:01,649 --> 00:28:03,384
I THINK WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS GREAT.

00:28:03,384 --> 00:28:05,719
AND IF YOU CAN COME UP
WITH A WAY TO AUTOMATE THIS

00:28:05,719 --> 00:28:07,621
SO YOU CAN SCALE,
THEN YOU GUYS ARE GOING PUBLIC,

00:28:07,621 --> 00:28:09,390

00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,449
WHAT DO YOU THINK --
WHAT DO YOU THINK WE'RE WORTH?

00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:17,516
I'M NOT CHARGING YOU
TO GIVE IT TO YOU.

00:35:17,516 --> 00:35:19,685
PLEASE. PLEASE.
SOME FREE ADVICE.

00:35:19,685 --> 00:35:20,953
YOU'RE WORTH
ABOUT 2.5 MILLION BUCKS.

00:35:22,521 --> 00:35:25,825
OKAY, NEXT, I'M GONNA TELL YOU
ABOUT OUR PLAN FOR 2015

00:35:25,825 --> 00:35:27,626
AND TELL YOU WHY I THINK
WE'RE WORTH MORE THAN THAT.

00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:30,563
I'M GIVING YOU FIVE TIMES
YOUR AFTER-TAX CASH FLOW --

00:35:30,563 --> 00:35:31,730
EXTREMELY GENEROUS OF ME.

00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:32,765
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

00:35:32,765 --> 00:35:34,567
WE GOT AN E-MAIL FROM TARGET

00:35:34,567 --> 00:35:35,701
JUST SAYING,
"WE LOVE YOUR BRAND.

00:35:35,701 --> 00:35:36,669
"WE SAW YOU IN THE MARKETPLACE,

00:35:36,669 --> 00:35:38,637
WE WANT TO BRING YOU
IN ALL STORES."

00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,706
NOW, WE ALSO
JUST GOT INTO LICENSING.

00:35:40,706 --> 00:35:42,475
SO THIS IS HOW
WE'RE GONNA GROW.

00:35:42,475 --> 00:35:43,876
WE WANT TO GROW TO MORE
LICENSING -- MARVEL, DC.

00:35:43,876 --> 00:35:45,578
DAN, WHY DO YOU NEED
THE MONEY?

00:35:45,578 --> 00:35:46,846
YOU DON'T NEED THE MONEY.
YOU BRING ME TO MY POINT.

00:35:46,846 --> 00:35:49,448
SO, I TRIED TO GET
THESE LICENSES, RIGHT?

00:35:49,448 --> 00:35:51,684
AND I GOT, LIKE,
"NO, WE'RE NOT INTERESTED."

00:35:51,684 --> 00:35:54,887
NOW, HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED
LICENSING YOUR BUSINESS

00:35:54,887 --> 00:35:58,791
TO SOMEBODY WHO HAS
ALL THESE PROPERTIES ALREADY?

00:35:58,791 --> 00:36:00,860
SO, THIS IS WHERE THE IDEA OF
A STRATEGIC PARTNER COMES IN.

00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:04,630
RIGHT NOW, THERE'S TWO MAJOR
PLAYERS IN LICENSED SPORTS,

00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,532
AND BOTH OF THEM
WANT TO CARRY OUR LINE.

00:36:06,532 --> 00:36:09,468
BUT WE KNOW IT'S GONNA
BE EXTREMELY LOW MARGIN
IF WE GO THROUGH THEM.

00:36:09,468 --> 00:36:11,570
IF WE HAVE YOU AS A PARTNER AND
YOU SAY, "HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?"

00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:12,671
"LET'S PUT THE MONEY OUT.

00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:13,906
LET'S DO --
GET THE LICENSING OURSELVES."

00:36:13,906 --> 00:36:16,876
WAY HIGHER -- HIGHER MARGINS,
AND WE CAN BLOW IT UP THAT WAY.

00:36:16,876 --> 00:36:18,878
WHY -- IF YOU FEEL THAT
THAT'S THE VALUE WE ADD,

00:36:18,878 --> 00:36:21,780
WHY DO YOU MAKE US PAY A PREMIUM
FOR IT?

00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,516
WHY ARE WE PAYING YOU
TO HELP YOU?

00:36:23,516 --> 00:36:24,917
RIGHT.

00:36:26,886 --> 00:36:28,487
I -- TO BE FRANK WITH YOU,

00:36:28,487 --> 00:36:29,955
I DON'T THINK
WE'RE CHARGING THAT MUCH.

00:36:29,955 --> 00:36:31,790
AT A $6 MILLION VALUATION

00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:33,792
AND WITH THE GROWTH STRATEGY
THAT I OUTLINED,

00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:35,528
I DO FEEL
IT'S A FAIR VALUE.

00:36:35,528 --> 00:36:37,830
NOBODY'S GONNA PAY YOU
MORE THAN FIVE TIMES
YOUR CASH FLOW FOR THIS.

00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:38,864
THEY JUST WON'T.

00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:40,900
THE ONLY MISTAKE
YOU'VE MADE

00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,569
IS YOU'VE -- YOU'VE PUT
A 100% PREMIUM ON IT,

00:36:43,569 --> 00:36:47,606
AND YET YOU WANT A SHARK SO THAT
THEY CAN ADD THEIR VALUE.

00:36:47,606 --> 00:36:49,608
VERY DIFFICULT TO DO THAT.

00:36:49,608 --> 00:36:50,843
I MEAN, IT'S A --
IT'S A MISTAKE.

00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:54,446
YOU'RE DOING EVERYTHING RIGHT,
OBVIOUSLY.

00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:55,514
YOU'RE MAKING A LOT OF MONEY.

00:36:56,582 --> 00:36:59,818
I CAN'T GET EXCITED
AND PASSIONATE ABOUT THESE.

00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:01,921
JUST MY PERSONAL THING.

00:37:01,921 --> 00:37:02,821
I'M OUT.

00:37:03,689 --> 00:37:05,491
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR TIME, LORI.
THANK YOU.

00:37:05,491 --> 00:37:07,626
O'Leary: OKAY,
YOU LOST YOUR FIRST SHARK.

00:37:07,626 --> 00:37:10,496
I DIDN'T HEAR YOU RE-ADJUST
YOUR VALUE, SO I'M OUT.

00:37:10,496 --> 00:37:13,866
LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN
CONVINCE SOMEBODY ELSE

00:37:13,866 --> 00:37:16,902
THAT YOU'RE WORTH
ANYTHING NEAR $6 MILLION.

00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:22,508
GUYS, I-I-I...

00:37:22,508 --> 00:37:25,477
I LOVE THE THREE OF YOU
AS OPERATORS.

00:37:25,477 --> 00:37:27,880
VERY, VERY CLEVER DESIGN.
IT MADE ME LAUGH.

00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,583
HERE'S MY CHALLENGE
WITH IT.

00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:32,484
YOU'RE IN LOVE
WITH THE FUTURE.

00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:34,887
I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO
BELIEVE IN THE FUTURE,

00:37:34,887 --> 00:37:37,656
BUT YOU CAN'T
LOVE THE FUTURE SO MUCH

00:37:37,656 --> 00:37:40,559
THAT IT CHANGES YOUR METRICS
OF TODAY.

00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:43,662
I REALLY WISH THAT THERE WAS
A MORE REASONABLE VALUE

00:37:43,662 --> 00:37:45,698
THAT YOU HAD
ON THIS BUSINESS.

00:37:45,698 --> 00:37:47,533
JUST LIKE ANY GREAT LOVE AFFAIR,

00:37:47,533 --> 00:37:49,735
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE SOME SENSE
OF REALITY TO IT.

00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:52,438
I'M OUT.

00:37:52,438 --> 00:37:54,707
YOU HAVE TWO SHARKS LEFT.

00:37:54,707 --> 00:37:56,809
YOU SHOULD FOCUS YOUR ENERGIES
ON THEM.

00:37:58,577 --> 00:37:59,645
W-- YOU KNOW, WE --

00:37:59,645 --> 00:38:02,448
WE WORKED PRETTY DAMN HARD
ON THESE THINGS.

00:38:02,448 --> 00:38:04,583
WE'VE ALWAYS DONE
EXTREMELY WELL.
NO, I -- NO ONE'S QUESTIONING
YOUR EFFORT.

00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:06,619
YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING.
WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT.
Levich: AND -- AND IF YOU FEEL
THE VALUATION ISN'T RIGHT,

00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:08,587
WE'D LOVE TO HEAR AN OFFER.
LIKE, WE --
LOVE TO HEAR AN OFFER.

00:38:08,587 --> 00:38:09,822
W-WE WANT TO GET AN --
WE'RE HERE TO MAKE A DEAL.

00:38:09,822 --> 00:38:11,523
WE'RE NOT HERE, YOU KNOW,
FOR ANYTHING ELSE.

00:38:11,523 --> 00:38:14,526
WHAT'S THE BEST EQUITY
YOU WOULD OFFER FOR $300,000?

00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:15,861
THE RIGHT NUMBER IS 20%.

00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:19,832
SO YOU'RE ASKING US TO VALUE
OUR COMPANY AT $1.5 MILLION?

00:38:19,832 --> 00:38:21,567
I'M GIVING YOU
FREE ADVICE.

00:38:21,567 --> 00:38:22,668
IF YOU WERE GOING
TO A PRIVATE-EQUITY FIRM,

00:38:22,668 --> 00:38:23,802
THEY'D ASK FOR 15%.

00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:26,438
BUT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BRING
A SHARK IN, YOU PAY A PREMIUM.

00:38:26,438 --> 00:38:29,475
THAT'S ANOTHER FIVE POINTS.
TRY 20%. MAYBE YOU GET THEM.

00:38:32,611 --> 00:38:37,683
WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO DO
A DEAL FOR $300,000 FOR 10%?

00:38:38,584 --> 00:38:41,487
NO.
OH, CRAZY. CRAZY.

00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:43,522
A-A $3 MILLION VALUATION?
DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER --
DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER NUMBER?

00:38:43,522 --> 00:38:45,557
WELL, ACTUALLY, KEVIN, YOU SAID
IT WAS WORTH $2.5 MILLION.

00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:48,594
AT $3 MILLION, IT DOESN'T
SEEM THAT CRAZY, DOES IT?

00:38:48,594 --> 00:38:50,562
I SEE YOU GUYS GOING
DOWN THE TOILET RIGHT NOW,

00:38:50,562 --> 00:38:52,631
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH --
YOU'RE ABOUT LOSE EVERYTHING.

00:39:02,808 --> 00:39:04,877
Narrator:
THREE SHARKS ARE OUT.

00:39:04,877 --> 00:39:06,845
DAYMOND AND MARK
MIGHT BE INTERESTED,

00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:09,448
BUT THEY ARE NOT SATISFIED

00:39:09,448 --> 00:39:10,616
EVEN THOUGH THE MAKERS

00:39:10,616 --> 00:39:12,951
OF THE NOVELTY EYEWEAR COMPANY
SUN-STACHE

00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:17,756
HAVE SLASHED THEIR VALUATION
FROM $6 MILLION TO $3 MILLION.

00:39:17,756 --> 00:39:20,559
OKAY, GUYS,
YOU'VE ALREADY PROVEN

00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:22,594
THAT YOU ARE GREAT DESIGNERS
AND YOU CAN WORK THIS OUT.

00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:23,729
SO HERE'S WHERE I SEE IT --

00:39:23,729 --> 00:39:25,764
I CAN HELP YOU GET
THE LICENSES YOU NEED,

00:39:25,764 --> 00:39:27,633
ALSO GET THEM
AT REDUCED COST,

00:39:27,633 --> 00:39:29,702
SO THAT'S WHERE
YOU'RE GONNA SAVE MONEY.

00:39:29,702 --> 00:39:34,473
BUT I NEED TO GET PAID FOR THAT,
AND I NEED 25%.

00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:36,775
YOW!

00:39:36,775 --> 00:39:38,444
RIGHT THERE.
Herjavec: OOH.

00:39:38,444 --> 00:39:39,645
BINGO.

00:39:39,645 --> 00:39:44,483
AND THAT WILL SAVE YOU A LOT
OF TIME AND A LOT OF MONEY.

00:39:44,483 --> 00:39:45,617
DAN,
I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT

00:39:45,617 --> 00:39:47,653
THAT DAYMOND IS THE ONLY GUY
WHO MADE YOU THE OFFER.

00:39:47,653 --> 00:39:49,855
MARK IS JUST ASKING YOU
TO NEGOTIATE AGAINST YOURSELF

00:39:49,855 --> 00:39:50,889
AND THROW OFFERS AT HIM.

00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,891
Cuban: IT'S TRUE.

00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:55,527
O'Leary: SO...

00:39:55,527 --> 00:39:59,598
YOU HAVE A FIRM OFFER,
AND IT'S GROUNDED IN REALITY.

00:39:59,598 --> 00:40:01,533
ISN'T GRAVITY A BITCH?

00:40:02,968 --> 00:40:04,903
DAYMOND,
I REALLY RESPECT YOUR OFFER,

00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:07,873
BUT $300,000, PUTTING
OUR COMPANY AT $1.2 MILLION

00:40:07,873 --> 00:40:10,476
WHEN WE MADE $570,000
LAST YEAR,

00:40:10,476 --> 00:40:12,878
WE'RE ON TRACK TO MAKE $750,00
THIS YEAR --

00:40:12,878 --> 00:40:15,481
AND YOU WILL BE ON TRACK
TO MAKE $20 MILLION AFTER THAT.

00:40:15,481 --> 00:40:17,783
THAT VALUATION
I JUST THINK IS REALLY LOW.

00:40:17,783 --> 00:40:21,653
WOULD YOU BE WILLING
MAYBE TO GO IN WITH MARK

00:40:21,653 --> 00:40:24,857
FOR $300,000 FOR 12.5%?

00:40:24,857 --> 00:40:26,825
I REALLY SEE THE VISION
WITH THE TWO OF YOU.

00:40:26,825 --> 00:40:29,561
I THINK TWO SHARKS WOULD BE
GREAT -- MARK WITH THE SPORTS.

00:40:29,561 --> 00:40:32,531
OH, I'M CLOSING THE BOOK.
I HATE DOING THAT.

00:40:32,531 --> 00:40:33,899
I HATE WHEN I HAVE TO
CLOSE THE BOOK.

00:40:33,899 --> 00:40:36,568
MARK, WOULD YOU BE WILLING,
PERHAPS,

00:40:36,568 --> 00:40:41,440
TO GO $300,000
FOR LIKE 12.5%?

00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,541
GUYS, NO.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:40:42,541 --> 00:40:43,776
I'M NOT GONNA DO 12.5%.
I'M OUT.

00:40:48,647 --> 00:40:51,483
YOU'RE OUT.
Herjavec: ERIC, DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S A LITTLE ODD

00:40:51,483 --> 00:40:54,820
THAT ONE GUY MADE YOU AN OFFER
AND YOUR REBUTTAL WAS TO MARK?

00:40:56,622 --> 00:41:01,693
DAYMOND, WOULD YOU BE WILLING
TO DO $300,000 FOR 15%?

00:41:01,693 --> 00:41:03,829
I THINK
THAT PUTS US AT ABOUT --

00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:06,932
DID YOU JUST OFFER MARK 12.5%
BUT DAYMOND 15%?
THAT'S WHAT HE DID.

00:41:06,932 --> 00:41:08,934
John: WELL, HE'S SAVING HIMSELF
RIGHT NOW.
IT'S OKAY.

00:41:08,934 --> 00:41:10,869
HE JUST -- HE JUST GAVE HIMSELF
A LITTLE BIT OF MOUTH-TO-MOUTH.

00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:12,671
WE CAME HERE
TO MAKE A DEAL.

00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:16,642
I WOULD NORMALLY CHARGE SOMEBODY
30% FOR MY SERVICES.

00:41:16,642 --> 00:41:19,812
SO I'LL MEET YOU AT 20%.

00:41:19,812 --> 00:41:23,682
AND I NEED THE ANSWER NOW, GUYS.
WE CAN'T TAKE FOREVER.

00:41:23,682 --> 00:41:26,485
'CAUSE THAT MEANS, THEN,
YOU'RE NOT DEFINITIVE

00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:28,487
IN REGARDS TO DECISIONS
YOU HAVE TO MAKE.

00:41:28,954 --> 00:41:30,756
WOULD YOU DO 17%?

00:41:32,825 --> 00:41:33,759
NO.

00:41:39,698 --> 00:41:41,567
Gershon: DAYMOND...

00:41:41,567 --> 00:41:43,569
LET'S MAKE IT HAPPEN,
CAP'N.

00:41:43,569 --> 00:41:44,803
ALL RIGHT.
[ BOTH LAUGH ]

00:41:44,803 --> 00:41:46,472
Gershon: THIS IS FOR YOU.
OH, THAT WAS PAINFUL.

00:41:46,472 --> 00:41:47,573
Greiner: GOOD DEAL.
THAT WAS BRUTAL.

00:41:47,573 --> 00:41:48,807
THANKS, MAN. WE'RE REALLY
EXCITED TO WORK WITH YOU.

00:41:48,807 --> 00:41:49,842
THANK YOU, MAN. A'IGHT.
SO EXCITED.

00:41:49,842 --> 00:41:51,577
THANKS, GUYS.
APPRECIATE IT.

00:41:51,577 --> 00:41:52,778
Greiner: GOOD LUCK.
ENJOY THAT.

00:41:52,778 --> 00:41:54,480
Cuban: GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
THANK YOU.

00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,714
Gershon: THANKS A LOT, GUYS.
OH, THOSE LOOK GOOD ON YOU.

00:41:55,714 --> 00:41:57,616
Herjavec:
YEAH, THEY DO LOOK GOOD ON YOU.
[ LAUGHS ]

00:41:57,616 --> 00:41:59,885
WE DID IT.
WHOO!

00:41:59,885 --> 00:42:01,787
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
WHOO!

00:42:01,787 --> 00:42:04,890
I THINK THAT'S THE FIRST TIME
WE'VE HAD SOMEBODY START AT 5%

00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:08,494
AND NEGOTIATE THEMSELVES
UP TO 20%.

00:42:08,494 --> 00:42:09,761
THEY JUST KEPT
THROWING OUT NUMBERS.

00:42:09,761 --> 00:42:11,630
I LIKE THEM A LOT.

00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:14,700
I WAS READY TO GO DOWN
TO 19.5%.

00:42:15,868 --> 00:42:17,503
SO, EVEN THOUGH
WE DIDN'T GET

00:42:17,503 --> 00:42:18,737
THE VALUATION
WE WERE ASKING FOR,

00:42:18,737 --> 00:42:20,806
WE GOT A SHARK, AND HE WANTS
TO BLOW UP OUR BUSINESS.

00:42:20,806 --> 00:42:22,741
AND HE SAID IT HIMSELF -- "I'M
GONNA MAKE YOU $20 MILLION."

00:42:22,741 --> 00:42:23,809
AND WE BELIEVE THAT.
WE BELIEVE.

00:42:23,809 --> 00:42:24,810
IT'S GONNA HAPPEN.
HELL, YEAH.

00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:25,844
YEP.
THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.
