WELCOME TO THE SHARK TANK,

00:00:03,435 --> 00:00:05,504
WHERE ENTREPRENEURS
SEEK AN INVESTMENT

00:00:05,504 --> 00:00:08,140
TO START, GROW,
OR SAVE THEIR BUSINESS.

00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,441
WE'VE RAISED $200 MILLION.

00:00:09,441 --> 00:00:11,276
WOW.
WHAT?!

00:00:11,276 --> 00:00:13,178
Narrator: IF THE SHARKS
HEAR A GREAT IDEA...

00:00:13,178 --> 00:00:14,546
IF THAT'S TRUE, BRING IT OVER.

00:00:14,546 --> 00:00:16,281
Narrator: ...THEY'LL INVEST
THEIR OWN MONEY...

00:00:16,281 --> 00:00:17,449
I LOVE THIS ONE.

00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:18,550
WHOO!
WHOO!

00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,119
Narrator: ...AND FIGHT
EACH OTHER FOR A DEAL.

00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:21,387
I'D LIKE TO OFFER YOU
$400,000.

00:00:21,387 --> 00:00:22,554
YOU'LL PARTNER WITH A BUNCH
OF DIFFERENT LABELS.

00:00:22,554 --> 00:00:23,555
EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME.

00:00:23,555 --> 00:00:24,590
I WASN'T FINISHED TALKING.

00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,525
I THINK I'M WORTH
TWICE AS MUCH AS BARBARA.

00:00:26,525 --> 00:00:27,559
HE'S RIGHT.

00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:29,428
Narrator:
BUT THE ENTREPRENEURS

00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:31,530
MUST GET THE FULL AMOUNT
THEY'RE ASKING FOR,

00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,465
OR THEY'LL WALK AWAY
WITH NOTHING.

00:00:33,465 --> 00:00:35,234
THIS TASTES LIKE [BLEEP]

00:00:35,234 --> 00:00:37,136
ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE ME OUT
BEHIND THE BARN NOW

00:00:37,136 --> 00:00:38,470
AND SHOOT ME?

00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,139
Narrator:
WHO ARE THE SHARKS?

00:00:41,373 --> 00:00:47,312
THEY'RE SELF-MADE BUSINESS
EXPERTS WORTH BILLIONS.

00:00:47,312 --> 00:00:50,449
KEVIN O'LEARY
IS A SHREWD VENTURE CAPITALIST

00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:54,319
WHO MADE HIS FORTUNE SELLING A
CHILDREN'S EDUCATIONAL COMPANY

00:00:54,319 --> 00:00:56,321
FOR OVER $4 BILLION.

00:00:56,321 --> 00:01:00,192
BARBARA CORCORAN WENT FROM
WAITING TABLES IN MANHATTAN

00:01:00,192 --> 00:01:04,229

[ BIRDS CHIRPING ]

00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:41,300
MY NAME IS CURT CAMPBELL,

00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,502
AND I LIVE IN BEAUTIFUL
EGG HARBOR, WISCONSIN,

00:01:43,502 --> 00:01:45,270
WITH MY FABULOUS WIFE, AMY JOE,

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,206
AND I'M THE OWNER
OF OILERIE USA.

00:01:47,206 --> 00:01:49,208
AMY JOE IS THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.

00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:51,276
WE WERE HIGH-SCHOOL SWEETHEARTS.

00:01:51,276 --> 00:01:54,079
WE'VE BEEN MARRIED
38 AMAZING YEARS.

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,515
SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND,
MY ROCK, MY LIGHT.

00:01:56,515 --> 00:01:58,217
IN 2003, WE WERE IN POLAND.

00:01:58,217 --> 00:01:59,418
WE CAME ACROSS A SMALL SHOP

00:01:59,418 --> 00:02:02,187
THAT WAS BOTTLING OLIVE OIL
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.

00:02:02,187 --> 00:02:03,622
WE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER
AND SAID,

00:02:03,622 --> 00:02:06,158
"WHY ISN'T ANYONE DOING THIS
IN AMERICA?"

00:02:06,158 --> 00:02:08,293
WE KNEW RIGHT THEN
WE WERE ONTO SOMETHING.

00:02:08,293 --> 00:02:10,329
HEY, SAUSAGE GUY!

00:02:10,329 --> 00:02:12,464
AMY JOE AND I HAVE TAKEN MANY
RISKS THROUGHOUT THE YEARS,

00:02:12,464 --> 00:02:14,199
BUT WE'RE PEOPLE
THAT NEVER GIVE UP.

00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,334
WE'VE GONE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK,

00:02:15,334 --> 00:02:17,302
AND WE SUFFERED THROUGH
SOME PRETTY HARD YEARS,

00:02:17,302 --> 00:02:19,171
BUT WE ALWAYS LOOK
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE OF LIFE.

00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:21,473
SUPER. THANKS FOR YOUR BUSINESS.
REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

00:02:21,473 --> 00:02:22,574
I KNOW THAT THE OILERIE

00:02:22,574 --> 00:02:25,110
CAN BECOME A HUGE
NATIONWIDE BUSINESS,

00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,246
BUT I'VE TAKEN IT AS FAR
AS I CAN BY MYSELF.

00:02:27,246 --> 00:02:30,249
AN INVESTMENT AND A PARTNERSHIP
WITH ANY OF THE SHARKS

00:02:30,249 --> 00:02:33,418
MEANS THAT WE CAN HAVE STORES
IN EVERY MAJOR CITY IN AMERICA

00:02:33,418 --> 00:02:34,620
AND BECOME A NATIONAL BRAND.

00:02:52,504 --> 00:02:55,140
HI,
MY NAME IS CURT CAMPBELL,

00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,243
AND I'M FROM BEAUTIFUL
EGG HARBOR, WISCONSIN.

00:02:58,243 --> 00:03:00,179
MY COMPANY IS OILERIE USA.

00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:02,447
I'M HERE TODAY
ASKING FOR $500,000

00:03:02,447 --> 00:03:05,284
IN EXCHANGE FOR 35%
OF MY COMPANY.

00:03:05,284 --> 00:03:09,254
KEVIN, YOU'VE MENTIONED
THAT YOU COLLECT OLIVE OIL,

00:03:09,254 --> 00:03:12,224
SO YOU KNOW THE NUANCES
OF FRESH OIL.

00:03:12,224 --> 00:03:14,426
BUT MANY AMERICANS --
A LOT OF AMERICANS --

00:03:14,426 --> 00:03:16,395
HAVE NEVER TASTED
FRESH OLIVE OIL.

00:03:16,395 --> 00:03:18,397
NOW, BEFORE THE OILERIE
CAME ALONG,

00:03:18,397 --> 00:03:20,165
THE ONLY WAY TO BUY OLIVE OIL

00:03:20,165 --> 00:03:22,401
WAS TO STARE AT A SHELF
FULL OF PRETTY LABELS

00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:24,236
AND BASICALLY POKE AND HOPE.

00:03:24,236 --> 00:03:29,241
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW IT'S GOING
TO TASTE OR IF IT'S EVEN FRESH.

00:03:29,241 --> 00:03:31,543
THE OILERIE OLIVE-OIL-BAR SYSTEM

00:03:31,543 --> 00:03:35,180
IS FULL OF MANY FLAVORS
OF FRESH OILS

00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,282
AND AGED BALSAMIC VINEGAR

00:03:37,282 --> 00:03:40,185
THAT ARE STORED
IN THESE EXCLUSIVE,

00:03:40,185 --> 00:03:43,222
STAINLESS STEEL TANKS
CALLED "FUSTIS."

00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:46,358
NOW, OUR CUSTOMERS IN AN OILERIE
STORE TASTE THE PRODUCT,

00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:49,161
AND ONLY AFTER THEY'VE MADE
THEIR SELECTIONS

00:03:49,161 --> 00:03:52,164
DO WE BOTTLE IT, AND WE BOTTLE
IT IN FRONT OF THEM.

00:03:52,164 --> 00:03:53,565
AND THEY GO CRAZY OVER THE FACT

00:03:53,565 --> 00:03:56,268
THAT THEY CAN TRY IT
BEFORE THEY BUY IT.

00:03:56,268 --> 00:03:57,402
CURT, CAN WE TRY IT?

00:03:57,402 --> 00:03:58,537
YOU MAY ABSOLUTELY TRY IT.

00:03:58,537 --> 00:04:01,306
AND THERE'S A PLATE
FOR EACH OF YOU.

00:04:02,341 --> 00:04:05,577
DO WE JUST DRINK IT?
IS THERE BREAD OR SOMETHING?

00:04:05,577 --> 00:04:07,446
WELL, YOU'RE TASTING
AN INGREDIENT,

00:04:07,446 --> 00:04:09,248
SO WE DON'T
CALL IT "DRINKING."

00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:10,415
BUT IF YOU'LL JUST TIP IT,

00:04:10,415 --> 00:04:14,386
A SMALL DROP WILL ROLL OFF
AND ONTO YOUR TONGUE.

00:04:14,386 --> 00:04:16,388
THIS WHITE TRUFFLE --
OH, MY GOSH.

00:04:16,388 --> 00:04:18,523
ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL?
IT'S REALLY GOOD.

00:04:18,523 --> 00:04:20,158
DO YOU KNOW WHAT WE SELL

00:04:20,158 --> 00:04:22,160
THAT BOTTLE OF
TRUFFLE OLIVE OIL FOR?

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,428
$16.50.

00:04:23,428 --> 00:04:28,500
THAT BOTTLE OF TRUFFLE OIL IS
GOING TO COST ME ABOUT $3.60.

00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,136
BRINGING OILS OVER
FROM ITALY IN BULK,

00:04:31,136 --> 00:04:34,306
I'M ACTUALLY PAYING ABOUT 21
CENTS AN OUNCE FOR MY OLIVE OIL.

00:04:34,306 --> 00:04:37,175
Cuban: WHERE DO YOU SELL THIS?
HOW DO YOU SELL IT?

00:04:37,175 --> 00:04:39,478
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
ET CETERA.

00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:43,148
OUR SALES LAST YEAR
WERE $3.1 MILLION.

00:04:43,148 --> 00:04:44,216
OH.
WOW.

00:04:44,216 --> 00:04:45,584
Greiner: WOW.
Barbara: UNBELIEVABLE.

00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:47,252
WHO ARE YOU SELLING TO?

00:04:47,252 --> 00:04:50,188
WELL, MY WIFE, AMY JOE, AND I --
HIGH-SCHOOL SWEETHEARTS.

00:04:50,188 --> 00:04:51,390
WE'VE BEEN MARRIED 38 YEARS.

00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,492
WE MADE A TRIP TO KRAKOW,
POLAND.

00:04:53,492 --> 00:04:54,526
AND IN KRAKOW,

00:04:54,526 --> 00:04:56,361
I WAS SEEING
THESE LITTLE BOUTIQUE SHOPS

00:04:56,361 --> 00:04:57,529
THAT WERE SELLING BULK OILS,

00:04:57,529 --> 00:04:59,498
AND THEY WOULD BOTTLE IT
IN FRONT OF YOU.

00:04:59,498 --> 00:05:02,267
AND I'M THINKING, "THAT'S THE
COOLEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN.

00:05:02,267 --> 00:05:04,202
WHY ISN'T ANYONE DOING THIS
IN AMERICA?"

00:05:04,202 --> 00:05:05,570
WE CAME BACK FROM THAT TRIP,

00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,307
AND WE OPENED A LITTLE, TINY
RETAIL SHOP

00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:10,108
IN FISH CREEK, WISCONSIN --

00:05:10,108 --> 00:05:12,277
THE FIRST OLIVE OIL STORE
IN AMERICA.

00:05:12,277 --> 00:05:16,348
SO, CURT, TODAY THE STORE
IS A RETAIL LOCATION,

00:05:16,348 --> 00:05:19,484
AND YOU DID $3.1 MILLION
LAST YEAR?

00:05:19,484 --> 00:05:21,320
IN OUR FRANCHISE SYSTEM!

00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,421
OH, YOU HAVE
A FRANCHISE SYSTEM?
OH.

00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:24,556
I'M SORRY.
I AM -- I AM SORRY.
OKAY.

00:05:24,556 --> 00:05:25,557
WHAT HAPPENED WAS,

00:05:25,557 --> 00:05:27,426
SINCE THIS WAS
THE FIRST TIME

00:05:27,426 --> 00:05:29,528
A SHOP LIKE THIS
EXISTED IN AMERICA,

00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:32,230
THERE WAS AN EXTREME AMOUNT
OF INTEREST.

00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,199
CUSTOMERS WERE DEMANDING
A FRANCHISE.

00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:36,134
HOW DO WE DO THIS
ON OUR OWN?

00:05:36,134 --> 00:05:39,237
SO WE SPENT A CONSIDERABLE
AMOUNT OF MONEY

00:05:39,237 --> 00:05:41,239
ON LAWYERS AND CONSULTANTS

00:05:41,239 --> 00:05:44,543
AND DEVELOPED THE OILERIE USA
FRANCHISE SYSTEM.

00:05:44,543 --> 00:05:46,411
HOW MANY FRANCHISES
DO YOU HAVE?

00:05:46,411 --> 00:05:47,512
WE ENDED UP WITH SEVEN.

00:05:47,512 --> 00:05:49,448
HILTON HEAD ISLAND,
TWO IN OHIO,

00:05:49,448 --> 00:05:51,450
MILWAUKEE, FISH CREEK,

00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,286
TWO IN THE TWIN CITIES
OF MINNEAPOLIS-SAINT PAUL,

00:05:54,286 --> 00:05:56,221
AND THEN ONE
ON THE WEST COAST --

00:05:56,221 --> 00:05:57,322
LAKE OSWEGO, PORTLAND.

00:05:57,322 --> 00:05:59,558
AND HOW DO THEY PAY
THE FRANCHISE FEE?

00:05:59,558 --> 00:06:02,361
THE FRANCHISE FEE,
WHICH IS $37,500 --

00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:04,262
TO START,
BUT WHAT'S THE ONGOING?

00:06:04,262 --> 00:06:05,330
8% ROYALTIES.

00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,232
I THINK I'VE DISTILLED
OUT OF THIS

00:06:07,232 --> 00:06:08,266
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE,

00:06:08,266 --> 00:06:10,135
BECAUSE I DO COLLECT
OLIVE OILS.

00:06:10,135 --> 00:06:11,203
I'M A BUYER OF IT.

00:06:11,203 --> 00:06:13,238
I'M PRETTY FAMILIAR
WITH THE INDUSTRY,

00:06:13,238 --> 00:06:15,173
AND I'LL MAKE A COMMENT
ON YOUR OLIVE OIL.

00:06:15,173 --> 00:06:16,308
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH IT.

00:06:16,308 --> 00:06:18,276
IT IS A MID- TO LOW-MARKET
OFFERING, OKAY?

00:06:18,276 --> 00:06:19,478
HE'S AN OLIVE OIL SNOB.

00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:22,147
IN CITIES LIKE CHICAGO
AND NEW YORK

00:06:22,147 --> 00:06:23,348
AND DALLAS AND SAN FRANCISCO,

00:06:23,348 --> 00:06:25,183
THERE ARE MANY, MANY OPTIONS

00:06:25,183 --> 00:06:27,152
IN TERMS OF WHERE
SOMEONE LIKE I

00:06:27,152 --> 00:06:29,621
CAN GO TO BUY AND INVEST
IN OLIVE OIL.
RIGHT. YES.

00:06:29,621 --> 00:06:32,290
IN THE PLACES YOU HAVE LOCATED,

00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,393
THERE'S NO OTHER OPTION TO
TASTE IT OR EVEN TO BUY IT,

00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:35,360
IN SOME CASES.

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,461
AND THE REASON
YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL

00:06:36,461 --> 00:06:38,463
IS YOU'VE DEFAULTED
TO THOSE LOCATIONS.

00:06:38,463 --> 00:06:40,265
THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE.

00:06:40,265 --> 00:06:42,367
THIS WOULD NOT WORK
IN NEW YORK CITY.

00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:45,537
I'M BANKING ON THE FACT
THAT OUR TRADEMARK, OILERIE --

00:06:45,537 --> 00:06:47,205
I MEAN, IF YOU WANTED
TO BUY WINE,

00:06:47,205 --> 00:06:48,540
YOU'RE GOING TO MAYBE GO
TO A WINERY, BUT...

00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,175
NOW, LOOK. I-I DON'T THINK

00:06:50,175 --> 00:06:51,576
OILERIE IS A BIG ENOUGH
BRAND YET.

00:06:51,576 --> 00:06:52,411
"YET."

00:06:54,246 --> 00:06:55,514
THIS IS THE NEXT STARBUCKS.

00:06:55,514 --> 00:06:57,582
OH, I DON'T THINK SO.
DON'T GO THERE.

00:06:57,582 --> 00:07:00,218
I DON'T THINK.
IN FISH CREEK, WISCONSIN,

00:07:00,218 --> 00:07:03,555
APPLE DOES $6,000 A SQUARE FOOT
RETAIL SPACE,

00:07:03,555 --> 00:07:05,490
TIFFANY DOES $3,000.

00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,627
OILERIE FISH CREEK
IS NUMBER THREE AT $2,100.

00:07:08,627 --> 00:07:11,196
BUT, CURT, IS THAT
BECAUSE YOU'RE THERE?
HOW MUCH OF THAT
IS IN THE SUMMER?

00:07:11,196 --> 00:07:12,397
NO, I-I DO NOT WORK
IN THE STORE.

00:07:12,397 --> 00:07:14,266
I HAD TO GET OUT OF THE STORE
THREE YEARS AGO

00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:15,500
BECAUSE THE STRESS
WAS KILLING ME.

00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,403
I'M JUST TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND --

00:07:18,403 --> 00:07:21,606
IS YOUR BUSINESS READY TODAY
TO SCALE?

00:07:21,606 --> 00:07:23,575
IT IS.

00:07:23,575 --> 00:07:25,444
'CAUSE THERE'S GOT TO BE
SOMEBODY DOING THE SALES.

00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:27,312
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMEBODY
DOING THE NEGOTIATIONS.

00:07:27,312 --> 00:07:28,547
YES.
YOU'RE A GREAT
RELATIONSHIP GUY.

00:07:28,547 --> 00:07:30,449
WHO'S DOING THE OTHER PART?

00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,252
THE ONLY ANSWER I HAVE
FOR YOU, ROBERT,

00:07:34,252 --> 00:07:35,353
IS THAT'S WHY I'M HERE --

00:07:35,353 --> 00:07:36,655
TO WORK
WITH A PERSON LIKE YOU

00:07:36,655 --> 00:07:38,523
FOR FINANCE
AND CASH MANAGEMENT.

00:07:39,658 --> 00:07:41,526
YOU'RE AN IMPRESSIVE GUY.

00:07:41,526 --> 00:07:44,229
I THINK THE PRODUCT IS GREAT.

00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:46,298
BUT YOU ALSO SAID
THAT THE STRESS BOTHERED YOU.

00:07:46,298 --> 00:07:48,467
YOU HAD TO TAKE YOURSELF
OUT OF IT.

00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:49,601
AND MY CONCERN IS,

00:07:49,601 --> 00:07:51,603
WHEN I PARTNER
WITH MY ENTREPRENEURS,

00:07:51,603 --> 00:07:53,505
I'M THERE WITH THEM,
I HELP THEM,

00:07:53,505 --> 00:07:54,606
BUT I NEED SOMEBODY

00:07:54,606 --> 00:07:57,242
WHO IS GOING TO REALLY BE
RUNNING THE BUSINESS

00:07:57,242 --> 00:07:59,511
AND THE LEADER IN IT
WHILE THEY GET MY SUPPORT.

00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:01,213
AND BECAUSE I'M CONCERNED

00:08:01,213 --> 00:08:02,514
THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE UP

00:08:02,514 --> 00:08:05,450
TO HAVING TO DEAL WITH ALL
THE STRESS OF THAT,

00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,219
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.

00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:08,420
MAY I ADDRESS THAT?

00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,489
OF COURSE.
ALL RIGHT.

00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:12,157
WHEN WE WERE DOING
THE RETAIL STORE,

00:08:12,157 --> 00:08:13,291
THIS WAS OUR BABY.

00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:16,461
THE RENT WAS $2,000 --
SCARED US TO DEATH

00:08:16,461 --> 00:08:19,264
BECAUSE WE
DIDN'T HAVE $2,000.

00:08:19,264 --> 00:08:21,233
IN OUR MARRIED LIFE,

00:08:21,233 --> 00:08:22,534
WE'VE HAD THE PHONE
DISCONNECTED,

00:08:22,534 --> 00:08:24,369
WE'VE HAD THE POWER
DISCONNECTED,

00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:26,471
WE'VE HAD
CABLE DISCONNECTED.
I'VE BEEN THERE.

00:08:26,471 --> 00:08:28,440
WE WOULD CLOSE
ON WEDNESDAYS,

00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,575
AND I WOULD TAKE THE TRUCK
TO GREEN BAY TO THE WAREHOUSE

00:08:30,575 --> 00:08:32,277
AND BRING BACK
SIX MORE PALLETS

00:08:32,277 --> 00:08:33,578
SO THAT WE COULD WORK
ANOTHER WEEK.

00:08:33,578 --> 00:08:36,281
THIS WAS THE 8-DAY-A-WEEK JOB
AND THE 90 HOURS.

00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:38,483
NOW, I DON'T MIND DOING THAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:08:38,483 --> 00:08:40,485
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS WHAT
EVERY ENTREPRENEUR

00:08:40,485 --> 00:08:44,256
WHO WATCHES THIS SHOW
NEEDS TO HEAR.
YEAH.

00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:45,624
THAT, IN ORDER
TO GET TO THIS POINT,

00:08:45,624 --> 00:08:47,559
THERE ARE TRADE-OFFS,
THERE'S STRESS.

00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:49,528
YES.
THERE'S UPS,
AND THERE'S DOWNS.

00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:52,197
YOU'RE EXPLAINING MORE
TO PEOPLE

00:08:52,197 --> 00:08:54,466
THAT WANT TO BE ENTREPRENEURS
THAN WE EVER COULD.

00:08:56,468 --> 00:08:57,369
CURT, I GET IT.

00:08:57,369 --> 00:08:59,371
WHAT I SEE IN FRONT OF ME

00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:03,208
IS A LOVELY, PATIENT,
HARDWORKING GENTLEMAN.

00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,476
THANK YOU.

00:09:04,476 --> 00:09:06,478
BUT IF YOU'RE GONNA BE
IN THE FRANCHISE BUSINESS,

00:09:06,478 --> 00:09:08,213
IT IS ONE ROYAL
PAIN IN THE NECK,

00:09:08,213 --> 00:09:09,447
AND IT'S A RUN
TO THE FINISH LINE

00:09:09,447 --> 00:09:11,183
BEFORE THE NEXT GUY
GETS THERE.

00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:12,317
YES.

00:09:12,317 --> 00:09:13,485
I THINK YOU'RE NOT CUT OUT
FOR THAT.

00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:16,655
AND SO I RELUCTANTLY SAY
I'M OUT.

00:09:16,655 --> 00:09:18,657
OKAY.
THANK YOU.

00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:22,194
Herjavec: CURT,
IT'S A GREAT BUSINESS.

00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,529
YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING
VERY FEW PEOPLE EVER DO.

00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:26,598
YOU CREATED SOMETHING
FROM NOTHING.

00:09:26,598 --> 00:09:29,334
TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO WORK
WITH YOU,

00:09:29,334 --> 00:09:32,437

MY LANGUAGE.

00:09:32,437 --> 00:09:33,405
I'M OUT.

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,544
O'Leary: THIS IS A GREAT
BUSINESS FOR YOU.

00:09:39,544 --> 00:09:41,146
I DON'T PERSONALLY THINK

00:09:41,146 --> 00:09:43,148
IT'S READY TO JUMP
TO THE FRANCHISE MODEL YET.

00:09:43,148 --> 00:09:44,416
ARE YOU GOING
TO TAKE ME OUT

00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:45,517
BEHIND THE BARN NOW
AND SHOOT ME?

00:09:45,517 --> 00:09:47,319
NO, I WON'T --
I WON'T SHOOT YOU, CURT.

HE'LL JUST WOUND YOU.
HE'LL JUST WOUND YOU.
YOU'RE A MASTERFUL --

[ LAUGHS ]

00:09:50,455 --> 00:09:52,624
LOOK, YOU -- YOU REALLY HUSTLED
TO CREATE SOMETHING

00:09:52,624 --> 00:09:55,193
THAT ADDS VALUE TO
CERTAIN RETAIL LOCATIONS.

00:09:55,193 --> 00:09:56,428
NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.
YES.

00:09:56,428 --> 00:09:59,264
BUT FOR ME, IT'S NOT INVESTABLE.
I'M OUT.

00:09:59,264 --> 00:10:00,599
THANK YOU, SIR.

00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:02,567

DO YOU KNOW WHAT A "SHARK TANK"
GOLD DIGGER IS?

00:10:06,571 --> 00:10:09,507
WHAT WE CALL A GOLD DIGGER
IS SOMEONE WHO COMES IN HERE

00:10:09,507 --> 00:10:12,510
LOOKING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THE EXPOSURE OF "SHARK TANK"

00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,513
WITH NO INTENTION
OF EVER GETTING A DEAL.

00:10:15,513 --> 00:10:17,482
YOU ARE THE EXACT OPPOSITE.

00:10:17,482 --> 00:10:18,516
THANK YOU.

00:10:18,516 --> 00:10:20,252
YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO

00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:23,421
IS GOING TO GET ENORMOUS
EXPOSURE, AND I'M GLAD.

00:14:23,283 --> 00:14:24,651
TO COME AND LOOK AT IT.
VERY CLEVER, ACTUALLY.

00:14:24,651 --> 00:14:26,587
BUT ON AVERAGE, WE PAY 88 CENTS
TO ACQUIRE A CUSTOMER.

00:14:26,587 --> 00:14:28,555
AND WHAT'S THE VALUE?

00:14:28,555 --> 00:14:30,290
AND WE GET $9 OUT OF
EVERY CUSTOMER ON AVERAGE.

00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,325
THAT'S THE AVERAGE VALUE?
YEAH.

00:14:31,325 --> 00:14:33,327
GUYS, I GET THAT
AS, YOU KNOW,

00:14:33,327 --> 00:14:36,163
A PERSONAL BUSINESS, PUTTING
$500,000, ESSENTIALLY,

00:14:36,163 --> 00:14:38,532
IN THE BANK FOR YOURSELVES
AS A COUPLE IS PHENOMENAL.

00:14:38,532 --> 00:14:40,467
BUT THERE'S A "BUT" COMING.

00:14:40,467 --> 00:14:41,635
YEAH, 'CAUSE IT DOESN'T
MAKE IT INVESTABLE.

00:14:41,635 --> 00:14:43,470
RIGHT.
RIGHT.

00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:46,306
YOU'VE GOT TO TELL US
WHERE YOU'RE GOING FROM THERE

00:14:46,306 --> 00:14:48,542
'CAUSE, TO BE HONEST,
TO BE IN BUSINESS 10 YEARS

00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:51,245
AND TO DO $987,000 IN
GROSS REVENUE IS HORRIBLE.

00:14:51,245 --> 00:14:52,613
OKAY, YEAH.

00:14:52,613 --> 00:14:54,681
IT'S -- IT'S BEEN A LIFESTYLE
BUSINESS UP TO THIS POINT.

00:14:54,681 --> 00:14:56,583
AND OF COURSE WE'RE HERE
BECAUSE THERE'S MORE.

00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,452
"BUT WAIT!"

00:14:58,452 --> 00:15:00,287
BUT WAIT.
THERE'S MORE.

00:15:00,287 --> 00:15:02,456
SO, PEOPLE HAVE USED
THIS SITE, HONEYFUND,

00:15:02,456 --> 00:15:04,358
FOR THINGS
OTHER THAN WEDDINGS.

00:15:04,358 --> 00:15:06,393
Sara:
SO WE CREATED PLUMFUND.

00:15:06,393 --> 00:15:08,495
ANYONE CAN RAISE MONEY
FOR ANYTHING WITH THIS SITE.

00:15:08,495 --> 00:15:10,531
THIS WOMAN'S
HAVING A BIRTHDAY.

00:15:10,531 --> 00:15:14,167
WE HAD A WOMAN THAT GRADUATED
WITH HER MASTER'S DEGREE.

00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:15,302
Herjavec: SARA, HANG ON.

00:15:15,302 --> 00:15:18,605
YOUR ANSWER
TO SCALING HONEYFUND

00:15:18,605 --> 00:15:21,241
IS TO DO ANOTHER FUND.

00:15:21,241 --> 00:15:24,244
OUR ANSWER IS TO DO
A WHOLE PORTFOLIO OF FUNDS.

00:15:24,244 --> 00:15:25,212
UGH.

00:15:25,212 --> 00:15:26,313
ARE THESE UP AND RUNNING?

00:15:26,313 --> 00:15:27,614
PLUMFUND AND HONEYFUND
ARE RUNNING.

00:15:27,614 --> 00:15:28,615
THESE ARE PLANNED.

00:15:28,615 --> 00:15:30,350
OKAY, GIVE US THE METRICS
ON PLUMFUND.

00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,352
WHEN DID IT START,
WHAT ARE THE REVENUES NOW?

00:15:32,352 --> 00:15:34,388
WE'VE GENERATED $400,000
WITH PLUMFUND

00:15:34,388 --> 00:15:35,589
AND ABOUT $10,000
IN REVENUE.

00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:37,190
HOW MANY MONTHS?

00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,659
UH, FOR ABOUT 12 MONTHS.

00:15:38,659 --> 00:15:40,661
Herjavec: I THINK
IT'S A FANTASTIC IDEA,

00:15:40,661 --> 00:15:43,163
BUT YOU --
YOU'RE NOT SELLING ME.

00:15:43,163 --> 00:15:45,232
I'VE GOT ANOTHER IDEA
FOR YOU.
ALL RIGHT.

00:15:45,232 --> 00:15:49,469
FONDODEMIEL -- THAT IS SPANISH
FOR "HONEYFUND."

00:15:49,469 --> 00:15:52,472
THERE ARE 53 MILLION SPANISH
SPEAKERS IN THE U.S. ALONE.

00:15:52,472 --> 00:15:55,342
THIS COULD DOUBLE OUR BUSINESS
OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS.

00:15:55,342 --> 00:16:00,380
YOU TOLD ME $217,000 AFTER YOU
PAID YOURSELF, PRE-TAX.

00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,349
YES.

00:16:02,349 --> 00:16:06,219
THAT'S $150,000 AFTER TAX OF
FREE CASH THIS CALENDAR YEAR.

00:16:06,219 --> 00:16:07,421
YEAH. MM-HMM.

00:16:07,421 --> 00:16:09,189
FOR THE VALUE ON IT
OF $4 MILLION.
MM-HMM.

00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:11,558
YOU WANT ME TO PAY 26 TIMES
YOUR FREE CASH FLOW

00:16:11,558 --> 00:16:13,527
TO BUY EQUITY
IN YOUR COMPANY.

00:16:13,527 --> 00:16:15,596
WE ARE -- THANK YOU FOR ASKING
ABOUT THE VALUATION.

00:16:15,596 --> 00:16:18,432
IT'S BASED ON PROJECTIONS
FOR 2015.

00:16:18,432 --> 00:16:21,234
SO YOU'RE GOING
TO GROW BY 350%?

00:16:21,234 --> 00:16:22,603
HOW YOU GONNA DO THAT?

00:16:22,603 --> 00:16:25,372
BY ADDING THE OTHER LIFE EVENTS
AND SPANISH.

00:16:25,372 --> 00:16:27,474
OH! SO THAT'S THE RISK
I HAVE TO TAKE --

00:16:27,474 --> 00:16:29,409
THAT YOUR CUSTOMER
ACQUISITION COSTS

00:16:29,409 --> 00:16:31,511
WILL BE THE SAME FOR THAT
AS THEY WERE ON THIS.

00:16:31,511 --> 00:16:33,213
THEY'LL BE SOMEWHAT HIGHER,

00:16:33,213 --> 00:16:35,315
BUT THEY COME DOWN OVER TIME,
IN OUR EXPERIENCE.

00:16:35,315 --> 00:16:37,517
YOU KNOW, I LOVE THE IDEA OF YOU
TAKING IT TO OTHER COUNTRIES --

00:16:37,517 --> 00:16:38,452
DOING IT IN SPANISH.

00:16:38,452 --> 00:16:40,287
YOU'RE JUST EXPANDING IT.

00:16:40,287 --> 00:16:41,655
I THINK
THAT'S REALLY SMART.

00:16:41,655 --> 00:16:45,626
BUT I THINK CROWDFUNDING
IS CROWDED.

00:16:45,626 --> 00:16:48,562
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.

00:16:48,562 --> 00:16:51,565
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME,
LORI.
THANK YOU.

00:16:51,565 --> 00:16:53,233
IF YOU GET FUNDED TODAY,

00:16:53,233 --> 00:16:54,668
HOW WOULD I GET
MY $400,000 BACK?

00:16:54,668 --> 00:16:56,503
SO, WHAT WE'RE
PLANNING TO DO

00:16:56,503 --> 00:16:59,306
IS SCALE THE BUSINESS QUICKLY
OVER FIVE YEARS,

00:16:59,306 --> 00:17:01,441
REALLY DOMINATE
THE CROWD-GIFTING SPACE.

00:17:01,441 --> 00:17:04,511
GUYS, JUST -- JUST WHAT
YOU SAID RIGHT THERE
DOES NOT MAKE SENSE.

00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:08,315
THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS SCALING
QUICKLY OVER FIVE YEARS.

00:17:08,315 --> 00:17:10,517
YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE THIS
A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY,

00:17:10,517 --> 00:17:12,419
AND BY SAYING
THAT YOU'RE LOOKING

00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:13,620
AT ALL THESE OTHER OPTIONS,

00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:16,223
YOU'RE TELLING ME
YOU DON'T HAVE A SOLUTION

00:17:16,223 --> 00:17:17,424
TO GO OUT AND DOMINATE JUST

00:17:17,424 --> 00:17:19,626
WHAT YOU ALREADY SUPPOSEDLY
ARE DOMINATING IN.

00:17:19,626 --> 00:17:21,361
WE ALREADY DO DOMINATE
THIS MARKET.
Cuban: THEN --

00:17:21,361 --> 00:17:22,462
WE HAVE 30% MARKET SHARE
IN THIS SPACE.

00:17:22,462 --> 00:17:24,598
YOU'VE GOT A NICE, LITTLE
BUSINESS, LIKE I SAID.

00:17:24,598 --> 00:17:26,500
BRAVO. RIGHT?

00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,535
BUT WHEN A BUSINESS
GETS TO A POINT

00:17:28,535 --> 00:17:31,471
WHERE YOU HAVE TO START LOOKING
EVERYWHERE ELSE,

00:17:31,471 --> 00:17:33,674
IT SUGGEST TO ME
THAT IT'S ON AUTOPILOT.

00:17:33,674 --> 00:17:38,545
IF IT WAS GROWING SO FAST
AND IT WAS SO PROFITABLE,

00:17:38,545 --> 00:17:40,280
THEN YOU'D BE TELLING US,

00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,616
"WE NEED THIS CAPITAL
JUST TO KEEP UP WITH IT."

00:17:42,616 --> 00:17:44,584
AND THAT'S NOT
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

00:17:44,584 --> 00:17:46,219
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.

00:17:46,219 --> 00:17:47,454
THANK YOU.

00:17:47,454 --> 00:17:49,489
Herjavec: OKAY, SARA, HERE --
HERE'S WHERE I'M AT.

00:17:49,489 --> 00:17:51,658
IN MY WORLD, THERE'S TWO TYPES
OF COMPANIES --

00:17:51,658 --> 00:17:53,226
THE QUICK AND THE DEAD.

00:17:53,226 --> 00:17:54,594
ALL RIGHT?

00:17:54,594 --> 00:17:58,565
YOU'RE APPROACHING
YOUR CORE VALUE

00:17:58,565 --> 00:18:01,368
AND TRYING TO MONETIZE IT
THE WRONG WAY.

00:18:01,368 --> 00:18:03,203
HMM.
I CAN HELP YOU.

00:18:03,203 --> 00:18:05,439
I THINK YOU'VE DONE
A PHENOMENAL JOB

00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,407
OF CREATING TRANSACTION VALUE.

00:18:07,407 --> 00:18:10,644
THAT'S WHERE YOU GOT TO GO TO,
NOT THE BRAND EXTENSION.

00:18:10,644 --> 00:18:12,279
OKAY.

00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:13,680
HERE'S MY OFFER, SARA.

00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,451
I'LL GIVE YOU -- YOU'RE ASKING
FOR $400,000.

00:18:17,451 --> 00:18:19,453
I'LL GIVE YOU $500,000...

00:18:19,453 --> 00:18:20,721
AND THE PLOT THICKENS.

00:18:32,264 --> 00:18:33,499
Narrator:
TWO SHARKS ARE OUT,

00:18:33,499 --> 00:18:34,533
AND ROBERT HAS OFFERED

00:18:34,533 --> 00:18:36,402
THE ONLINE GIFTING
REGISTRY HONEYFUND

00:18:36,402 --> 00:18:39,605
$100,000 MORE
THAN THEY WERE SEEKING.

00:18:39,605 --> 00:18:42,641
BUT HOW MUCH EQUITY
WILL HE WANT?

00:18:42,641 --> 00:18:45,577
I'LL GIVE YOU --
YOU'RE ASKING FOR $400,000?

00:18:45,577 --> 00:18:47,246
I'LL GIVE YOU $500,000...

00:18:49,181 --> 00:18:50,482
...FOR 50%.

00:18:50,482 --> 00:18:51,583
THANK YOU.

00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,318
SO A $1 MILLION VALUATION.

00:18:53,318 --> 00:18:54,486
$1 MILLION VALUATION.

00:18:54,486 --> 00:18:57,256
IT'S FOUR TIMES WHAT YOU EARNED
LAST YEAR.

00:18:57,256 --> 00:18:59,324
BECAUSE OF THE DIRECTIONS
YOU WANT TO GO,

00:18:59,324 --> 00:19:01,093
I GOT TO BE AN EQUAL PARTNER.

00:19:01,093 --> 00:19:03,195
HMM.

00:19:03,195 --> 00:19:05,097
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
THOSE ARGUMENTS WITH YOU

00:19:05,097 --> 00:19:06,532
ABOUT YOU WANT TO GO THIS WAY,
I WANT TO GO THAT WAY.

00:19:06,532 --> 00:19:08,400
WE GOT TO BE
ON THE SAME PAGE.

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,370
IF YOU WANT TO DOMINATE
THIS SPACE, I'M YOUR GUY.

00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,272
AND THE PLOT THICKENS.

00:19:13,272 --> 00:19:15,140
O'Leary: OKAY.
SURE DOES.

00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,375
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU AN OFFER
THAT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,577
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $400,000.

00:19:18,577 --> 00:19:20,446
I DON'T WANT ANY EQUITY.

00:19:20,446 --> 00:19:24,149
I WANT 1/3 OF
YOUR TRANSACTIONAL REVENUE

00:19:24,149 --> 00:19:26,518
UNTIL I GET THREE TIMES BACK
ON MY $400,000.

00:19:26,518 --> 00:19:29,455
THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO PAY ME
BACK $1.2 MILLION.

00:19:29,455 --> 00:19:32,257
AND HERE'S THE GOOD PART.

00:19:32,257 --> 00:19:34,193
AFTER THAT, I'M GONE.

00:19:34,193 --> 00:19:35,594
YOU GIVE UP NOTHING.

00:19:37,396 --> 00:19:39,264
AND WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
FOR THEM?

00:19:39,264 --> 00:19:40,466
I'M GOING TO FUND THEM.

00:19:40,466 --> 00:19:42,434
THAT'S IT.
YOU'VE MET A BANKER HERE TODAY.
YEP.

00:19:42,434 --> 00:19:44,436
I AM FUNDING YOUR GROWTH
FOR YOU

00:19:44,436 --> 00:19:47,306
AND GETTING A PRETTY DECENT
RETURN FOR DOING IT,

00:19:47,306 --> 00:19:48,440
BUT NO EQUITY.

00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,576
IF YOU HIT IT OUT OF THE PARK,
IT'S ALL YOURS.

00:19:50,576 --> 00:19:52,444
I GOT IT.
Cuban: HE'S RIGHT.

00:19:52,444 --> 00:19:54,313
HE'S RIGHT. I'VE NEVER, EVER,
EVER IN MY ENTIRE LIFE

00:19:54,313 --> 00:19:55,514
SAID, "MR. WONDERFUL OFFERED
A GOOD DEAL."

00:19:55,514 --> 00:19:57,382
Sara: I HAVE NEVER HEARD A DEAL
FROM HIM LIKE THAT.

00:19:57,382 --> 00:19:58,584
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

00:19:58,584 --> 00:20:00,486
YOU'RE DOING
A PHONY ROYALTY DEAL

00:20:00,486 --> 00:20:02,554
DISGUISED AS SOMETHING ELSE.
NO, HE'S NOT. NO, HE'S NOT.
NO, HE'S NOT.

00:20:02,554 --> 00:20:04,256
IT'S THE SAME THING.
IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING BETTER --

00:20:04,256 --> 00:20:05,357
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CREATIVITY,
BARBARA.

00:20:05,357 --> 00:20:07,392
JOSH, THE ONLY THING
HE CARES ABOUT

00:20:07,392 --> 00:20:09,495
IN HIS OFFER
IS GETTING HIS MONEY BACK.

00:20:09,495 --> 00:20:11,330
OF COURSE.
WHICH IS FINE.

00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,198
AND SO DO YOU.
WHO DOESN'T?

00:20:13,198 --> 00:20:14,333
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
HANG ON A SECOND.

00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,135
WHAT I CARE ABOUT IS GROWING
THE BUSINESS FUNDAMENTALLY.

00:20:16,135 --> 00:20:17,503
I WOULD PREFER THAT YOU FOCUS

00:20:17,503 --> 00:20:21,173
ON GETTING BACK MORE OF THAT
70% SHARE YOU DON'T HAVE,

00:20:21,173 --> 00:20:22,374
AND I WOULD WORK TOWARDS THAT,

00:20:22,374 --> 00:20:24,443
BECAUSE IT WOULD COMPRESS
THE TIME I'M WAITING

00:20:24,443 --> 00:20:26,378
TO GET MY $1.2 MILLION BACK.
Sara: YES.

00:20:26,378 --> 00:20:28,547
I CAN TELL YOU UNEQUIVOCALLY
IT'S A BAD IDEA.

00:20:28,547 --> 00:20:32,451
I DON'T LEND MONEY
TO SMALL BUSINESSES

00:20:32,451 --> 00:20:34,353
AND TRY TO GET IT BACK
AT ANY COST.

00:20:34,353 --> 00:20:36,421
I INVEST IN COMPANIES
TO GROW THEM QUICKLY.

00:20:37,623 --> 00:20:39,158
BARB, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:20:39,158 --> 00:20:41,393
I LOVE THE TWO OF YOU.

00:20:41,393 --> 00:20:43,462
YOU'RE ROCK SOLID.
YOU COULDN'T BE BETTER PARTNERS.

00:20:43,462 --> 00:20:45,397
HERE'S MY OFFER.

00:20:45,397 --> 00:20:50,335
$400,000 FOR 30%.

00:20:50,335 --> 00:20:52,171
SARA, I'LL MATCH
BARBARA'S OFFER.

00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,276
SO, WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?

00:20:59,411 --> 00:21:01,380
SO, ROBERT,
WE WOULD BE INTERESTED

00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,481
IN DOING A DEAL WITH YOU

00:21:02,481 --> 00:21:04,583
IF YOU WOULD BE WILLING
TO GO DOWN TO 25%.

00:21:06,451 --> 00:21:08,320
Herjavec:
THAT'S RIDICULOUS, JOSH.

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,522
YOU'RE GONNA NEGOTIATE WITH ME
ON A 5% DEAL?

00:21:10,522 --> 00:21:12,424
WE DON'T WANT TO START
THAT WAY.

00:21:12,424 --> 00:21:14,593
I'M STICKING AT $400,000
AT 30%.

00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:20,599
[ WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY ]

00:21:24,369 --> 00:21:26,438
MR. O'LEARY,
YOU HAVE A DEAL.

I THINK YOU MADE
A WISE DECISION.
WOW.

00:21:32,177 --> 00:21:33,345
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:21:33,345 --> 00:21:34,379
O'Leary:

Sara: THANK YOU.

00:21:34,379 --> 00:21:35,414
CONGRATS, GUYS.

00:21:35,414 --> 00:21:39,151
WHOO-HOO!

00:21:39,151 --> 00:21:41,253
I THINK WE JUST GOT THE
BEST DEAL OUT OF MR. O'LEARY

00:21:41,253 --> 00:21:43,222
THAT ANYONE'S EVER GOT
OUT OF THE SHARK TANK.

00:21:43,222 --> 00:21:44,289
I THINK SO.
I THINK SO.

00:21:44,289 --> 00:21:45,457
KEVIN, I THINK YOU --

00:21:45,457 --> 00:21:47,526
YOU WAKE UP AT NIGHT
IN YOUR CRIB,

00:21:47,526 --> 00:21:50,229
AND YOU SAY, "WHAT DEALS
CAN I COME UP WITH TODAY?"

00:21:50,229 --> 00:21:51,530
ROBERT,
YOU HAVE NO CREATIVITY.

00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:53,365
YOU -- YOU SHARKS HAVE
NO CREATIVITY WHATSOEVER.

00:21:53,365 --> 00:21:55,434
I'M SENDING YOU AN INVOICE

00:21:55,434 --> 00:21:57,269
JUST BECAUSE YOU'VE LEARNED
SOMETHING TODAY.

00:21:57,269 --> 00:21:58,470
Cuban:
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

00:22:03,508 --> 00:22:04,610
Narrator: IN SEASON 5,

00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:07,246
WE SAW CHARLES MICHAEL YIM
MAKE A DEAL

00:22:07,246 --> 00:22:08,447
WITH ALL FIVES SHARKS

00:22:08,447 --> 00:22:11,416
FOR HIS INNOVATIVE SMARTPHONE
BREATHALYZER, BREATHOMETER.

00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:12,551
PLUG IT INTO A SMARTPHONE.

00:22:12,551 --> 00:22:14,286
WITHIN SECONDS,

00:22:14,286 --> 00:22:15,387
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO KNOW WHAT
YOUR BREATH-ALCOHOL LEVEL IS.

00:22:15,387 --> 00:22:18,156
$1 MILLION FOR 30%.
I ACCEPT.

00:22:18,156 --> 00:22:20,192
Narrator: LET'S SEE
WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW.

00:22:20,192 --> 00:22:21,393
I CAME BY THE TANK TODAY

00:22:21,393 --> 00:22:24,162
BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO GET ALL
FIVE SHARKS IN THE SAME ROOM.

00:22:24,162 --> 00:22:26,298
HEY, LOOK AT THIS GUY.
HEY, GUYS.

00:22:26,298 --> 00:22:28,166
AND I PERSONALLY WANTED
TO DROP BY

00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:30,168
TO SHOW THEM BREEZE,
OUR NEWEST PRODUCT.

00:22:30,168 --> 00:22:31,503
THIS IS BLUETOOTH.
IT'S WIRELESS.

00:22:31,503 --> 00:22:33,305
SO IF I CLICK THIS BUTTON
ON THE BACK,

00:22:33,305 --> 00:22:34,606
IT'LL PAIR WITHIN SECONDS.
OH, WOW.

00:22:34,606 --> 00:22:36,575
BREEZE IS THE MOST ADVANCED
SMARTPHONE BREATHALYZER

00:22:36,575 --> 00:22:37,376
IN THE WORLD.

00:22:37,376 --> 00:22:38,377
IT'S WIRELESS,

00:22:38,377 --> 00:22:39,544
AND IT HAS
A STATE-OF-THE-ART SENSOR

00:22:39,544 --> 00:22:41,480
WHICH ALLOWS IT TO HAVE
REAL-TIME RESULTS.

00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,581
THIS REALLY
TURNED OUT NICELY.

00:22:42,581 --> 00:22:45,183
WE ALWAYS LOVE
TO HEAR GREAT NEWS.

00:22:45,183 --> 00:22:46,351
NOW GET BACK TO WORK.

00:22:46,351 --> 00:22:47,552
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,588
WE FORMED A PARTNERSHIP
WITH CLEVELAND CLINIC,

00:22:49,588 --> 00:22:52,357
WHICH IS THE NUMBER-ONE BREATH
ANALYSIS LAB IN THE WORLD.

00:22:52,357 --> 00:22:53,525
TOGETHER, WE'LL BUILD PRODUCTS

00:22:53,525 --> 00:22:55,594
THAT WILL REVOLUTIONIZE
THE BREATH-ANALYSIS SPACE.

00:22:55,594 --> 00:22:57,195
IT'S PERFECT.

00:22:57,195 --> 00:22:59,298
UP UNTIL NOW, WE'VE BEEN
PREDOMINANTLY ONLINE,

00:22:59,298 --> 00:23:03,201
BUT WE'RE ABOUT
TO ROLL OUT NATIONWIDE.

00:23:03,201 --> 00:23:04,403
BECAUSE OF THE HELP
OF THE SHARKS,

00:23:04,403 --> 00:23:06,438
WE'RE GONNA BE AVAILABLE
AT BEST BUY AND BROOKSTONE.

00:23:06,438 --> 00:23:08,206
THERE IT IS.
OH, THERE IT IS.

00:23:08,206 --> 00:23:09,641
ON MY LAST UPDATE
JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO,

00:23:09,641 --> 00:23:12,210
I REPORTED A LITTLE
OVER $1 MILLION IN SALES.

00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,378
NOW, JUST A YEAR AFTER AIRING,

00:23:13,378 --> 00:23:15,314
WE HAVE CLOSE TO $10 MILLION
IN SALES.

00:23:15,314 --> 00:23:16,381
GOOD JOB.
AWESOME.

00:23:16,381 --> 00:23:18,383
I FEEL LIKE I'M LIVING
THE AMERICAN DREAM.

00:23:18,383 --> 00:23:19,484
POWER OF "SHARK TANK"

00:23:19,484 --> 00:23:21,486
BRINGING SOMETHING
THAT WAS JUST IN MY GARAGE

00:23:21,486 --> 00:23:24,222

00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:29,253
UNFORTUNATELY,
NOT ALL 911 CENTERS

00:24:29,253 --> 00:24:32,089
CAN RECEIVE GPS LOCATION
INFORMATION,

00:24:32,089 --> 00:24:34,391

00:25:25,576 --> 00:25:30,147
SO, WHICH ONE OF YOU SHARKS
WOULD LOVE TO EMERGE WITH US

00:25:30,147 --> 00:25:32,449

00:25:34,184 --> 00:25:35,185
YOU DOWNLOAD THE APP,

00:25:35,185 --> 00:25:36,587
AND YOU PUT
ALL YOUR INFORMATION IN,

00:25:36,587 --> 00:25:40,391
AND IT GOES DIRECTLY TO OUR
BACK END 911 MONITORING CENTER.

00:25:40,391 --> 00:25:43,260
YOU HAVE A -- YOU BUILT
A BACK END INTERFACE

00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,362
TO THE EXISTING 911 SYSTEM?

00:25:45,362 --> 00:25:47,431
WE -- ACTUALLY, TO OUR OWN
PRIVATE MONITORING CENTER.

00:25:47,431 --> 00:25:50,300
SO YOU DO IT LIKE
A SECURITY FIRM, BASICALLY.
CORRECT.

00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,502
JASON, WHEN THAT PERSON
IN YOUR CENTER

00:25:51,502 --> 00:25:53,303
IS GETTING THE INFORMATION,
WHAT DO THEY GAIN?

00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:55,305
THEY GET AUDIO, VIDEO,
GPS TRACKING,

00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:58,242
THE ABILITY TO TEXT AND HAVE
A CONVERSATION IMMEDIATELY.

00:25:58,242 --> 00:26:00,577
IN YOUR OWN EXAMPLE,
THAT GIRL IS WALKING,

00:26:00,577 --> 00:26:02,346
SHE'S GOT THE PHONE
IN HER HAND.
SURE. CORRECT.

00:26:02,346 --> 00:26:04,214
SHE TAPS THE BUTTON.
YEP.

00:26:04,214 --> 00:26:06,350
SHE'S WORRIED THERE'S SOMEBODY
BEHIND HER.
CORRECT.

00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:08,585
SHE'S NOT GONNA TAKE THAT PHONE,
TURN AROUND, AND GO LIKE THAT.

00:26:08,585 --> 00:26:10,087
WE'RE NOT ASKING HER TO.

00:26:10,087 --> 00:26:12,189
WHAT WE HOPE TO DO
IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT

00:26:12,189 --> 00:26:14,458
IS THEY ACTUALLY START TO ROLL
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT,

00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:16,493
FIRE, AND EMS
IF THEY FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE.

00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:20,197
BUT I DON'T GET WHY THAT'S
AN ADVANTAGE IN ANY WAY.

00:26:20,197 --> 00:26:21,331
LIKE, SAY, FOR EXAMPLE --

00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:23,367
WHY WOULDN'T I SPEED DIAL 911
AND FEEL JUST AS --

00:26:23,367 --> 00:26:24,568
WELL, 911
VERSUS TAPPING THAT --

00:26:24,568 --> 00:26:25,602
OR SPEED DIAL 911.

00:26:25,602 --> 00:26:27,304
Greiner:
WELL, ONE VERSUS THREE.

00:26:27,304 --> 00:26:29,373
WELL, AND -- AND THE REAL ISSUE
WITH DIALING THE 911 IS

00:26:29,373 --> 00:26:31,241
ALL THEY'RE GONNA GET
IS MUFFLED NOISES.

00:26:31,241 --> 00:26:33,310
WITH A VIDEO, IT ADDS
A COMPLETELY NEW DIMENSION.

00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,212
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE USING IT?
UH...

00:26:35,212 --> 00:26:37,114
211,000.

00:26:37,114 --> 00:26:38,482
DO YOU CHARGE THEM
TO DOWNLOAD IT?

00:26:38,482 --> 00:26:40,117
IT'S A FREE DOWNLOAD

00:26:40,117 --> 00:26:41,452
WITH THE ABILITY TO UPGRADE

00:26:41,452 --> 00:26:43,520
WITH THE FREE VERSION,
THERE'S NO MONTHLY MONITORING.

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,222
IT'S SENT TO FAMILY
AND FRIENDS.

00:26:45,222 --> 00:26:46,490
IT DOESN'T GO TO THE POLICE.

00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:48,158
BUT YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR IT.

00:26:48,158 --> 00:26:49,393
CORRECT --
THE FREE VERSION.
THE PAID VERSION --

00:26:49,393 --> 00:26:51,528
DO YOU HAVE 211,000
PREMIUM SUBSCRIBERS?

00:26:51,528 --> 00:26:53,197
NO.
NO.

00:26:53,197 --> 00:26:54,565
YOU HAVE 211,000 DOWNLOADS.
CORRECT.

00:26:54,565 --> 00:26:56,533
DING, DING, DING, DING, DING,
DING, DING!

00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:59,403
JUST LET ME SAY THAT, AS FAR
AS THE PREMIUM CUSTOMER GOES --

00:26:59,403 --> 00:27:00,537
THE MONTHLY SUBSCRIBERS --

00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:02,406
THAT WAS ONLY ROLLED OUT
A MONTH AGO.

00:27:02,406 --> 00:27:03,440
OF THE 211,000,

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,375
HOW MANY WENT
FOR THE PREMIUM SERVICE?

00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:07,411
WELL, WE JUST STARED
A MONTH AGO.

00:27:07,411 --> 00:27:09,179
I THINK THERE'S LIKE 138.

00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:11,248
HOW MUCH ARE THEY PAYING
A MONTH?

00:27:11,248 --> 00:27:12,349
$8.99 A MONTH.

00:27:12,349 --> 00:27:13,617
BUT OVER
THE PAST SIX MONTHS,

00:27:13,617 --> 00:27:16,453
WE'VE SIGNED UP NUMEROUS
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES.

00:27:16,453 --> 00:27:19,456
WE HAVE, UH, SOME ENTERPRISES,
BUSINESSES, WE SIGNED UP.

00:27:19,456 --> 00:27:21,525
WE ALSO HAVE SOME
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.

00:27:21,525 --> 00:27:24,094
TELL ME ABOUT
THE ENTERPRISE VERSION. JUST --

00:27:24,094 --> 00:27:25,395
WE COME TO YOUR COLLEGE
OR UNIVERSITY

00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:27,097
OR CORPORATION
AND WE INSTALL IT.

00:27:27,097 --> 00:27:28,398
WE SET UP A GEO-FENCE
AT YOUR LOCATION.

00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:30,300
ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS
WITHIN THAT GEO-FENCE

00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,436
GOES RIGHT TO YOUR PUBLIC SAFETY
OR SECURITY DEPARTMENT.

00:27:32,436 --> 00:27:35,472
AND GEOFENCE MEANS THAT
YOU CAN RECOGNIZE ANYTHING
INSIDE THAT PERIMETER?

00:27:35,472 --> 00:27:37,307
CORRECT.

00:27:37,307 --> 00:27:39,610
SO, LORI'S AT COLLEGE,

00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:41,378
AND THAT UNIVERSITY
OR COLLEGE

00:27:41,378 --> 00:27:43,180
IS PART OF
YOUR ENTERPRISE PROGRAM.

00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,314
RIGHT.

00:27:44,314 --> 00:27:46,483
SO SHE PUSHES THE BUTTON.
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENS.

00:27:46,483 --> 00:27:48,385
IF THEY HIT IT AND THEY'RE
ON THE COLLEGE CAMPUS,

00:27:48,385 --> 00:27:50,254
IT GOES RIGHT BACK TO THE PUBLIC
SAFETY DEPARTMENT.

00:27:50,254 --> 00:27:51,388
ARE THEY PAYING YOU
FOR THIS?

00:27:51,388 --> 00:27:53,457
AVERAGE INSTALLATION
FOR A COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY

00:27:53,457 --> 00:27:54,591
IS ABOUT $25,000 TO START.

00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:57,294
$25,000 ANNUALLY?
YES, ANNUALLY.

00:27:57,294 --> 00:27:58,395
SO THAT'S A LITTLE BUSINESS.
NOW WE'RE TALKING!

00:27:58,395 --> 00:28:00,297
OKAY, SO WHAT'S
YOUR TOTAL SALES?

00:28:00,297 --> 00:28:02,166
$180 -- $185,000.

00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:07,171
OF THE $185,000,
WHAT WAS YOUR PROFIT?

00:28:07,171 --> 00:28:08,238
THERE'S NO PROFIT
AT THIS TIME.

00:28:08,238 --> 00:28:09,540
WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA BE
PROFITABLE AROUND OCTOBER.

00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,141
Greiner:
BUT WHAT DID YOU LOSE?

00:28:11,141 --> 00:28:12,242
HOW MUCH DID YOU
PUT IN YOURSELF?

00:28:12,242 --> 00:28:14,178
I PUT IN OVER $3 MILLION.

00:28:14,178 --> 00:28:15,179
Both: $3 MILLION?

00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:17,514
OOH.
Corcoran: OH, MY GOD.

00:28:17,514 --> 00:28:18,515
WHERE DID YOU GET
THAT MONEY FROM?

00:28:18,515 --> 00:28:21,351
I WAS IN BANKING, OIL,
REAL ESTATE.

00:28:21,351 --> 00:28:22,553
SOLD ALL THOSE OFF.

00:28:22,553 --> 00:28:25,289
WHO -- WHO'S YOUR TECH --
WHO'S YOUR MAIN GEEK?

00:28:25,289 --> 00:28:27,357
MAIN GEEK IS A GUY NAMED --
IS A GUY NAMED JEAN.

00:28:27,357 --> 00:28:30,227
IT'S A GREAT COMPANY
THAT WE HAVE WORKING WITH US.

00:28:30,227 --> 00:28:32,296
SO YOU CAME UP WITH THE IDEA,
RIGHT?
Reitnour: YES.

00:28:32,296 --> 00:28:33,463
YOU THOUGHT
IT WAS A GREAT IDEA.

00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:35,265
AND THEN YOU OUTSOURCED IT
TO THESE GUYS,

00:28:35,265 --> 00:28:36,233
WHO CHARGED YOU HOW MUCH?

00:28:36,233 --> 00:28:37,401
WE STARTED FIRST WITH A GUY

00:28:37,401 --> 00:28:39,603
WHO WAS A DIRECTOR, UH,
OF TECHNOLOGY AT APPLE.

00:28:39,603 --> 00:28:41,271
HE PUT ME IN TOUCH
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.

00:28:41,271 --> 00:28:43,507
YOU REALIZED THAT WAS A
SUPER-COMPETITIVE BUSINESS,

00:28:43,507 --> 00:28:46,276
RIGHT, THAT WAS GONNA BE
VERY DIFFICULT?
YEP, THAT'S CORRECT.
THAT'S CORRECT.

00:28:46,276 --> 00:28:47,544
SO YOU SAID, "I NEED
SOME MORE BRAIN POWER

00:28:47,544 --> 00:28:49,146
"TO MAKE IT MORE --
MORE ADVANCED

00:28:49,146 --> 00:28:50,314
SO THAT I CAN
DIFFERENTIATE MYSELF."

00:28:50,314 --> 00:28:51,248
RIGHT.

00:28:51,248 --> 00:28:52,616
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU PAID THEM

00:28:52,616 --> 00:28:54,451
TO DEVELOP THE TECHNOLOGY?

00:28:54,451 --> 00:28:56,486
THE FIRST SECTION
OF THE DEVELOPMENT

00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:59,156
FOR THE TECHNOLOGY
WAS ABOUT 500 GRAND,

00:28:59,156 --> 00:29:01,358
AND THEN I'D SAY THE NEXT PART
WAS, YOU KNOW, $750,000,

00:29:01,358 --> 00:29:03,327
AND THEN THE LAST PART
WAS ABOUT $750,000.

00:29:03,327 --> 00:29:04,361
WHOA.

00:29:04,361 --> 00:29:06,129
THEY SAW YOU COMING, BRO.
YEAH.

00:29:06,129 --> 00:29:08,198
YOU PUT $3 MILLION IN.
WHAT'S LEFT IN THE BANK?

00:29:08,198 --> 00:29:10,467
ROUGHLY,
THERE'S $68,000 IN THE BANK.

00:29:10,467 --> 00:29:13,170
WOW!

00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:16,406
LOOK, YOU -- YOU'RE GOING
THROUGH A PROBLEM

00:29:16,406 --> 00:29:19,509
THAT EVERY ENTREPRENEUR
WHO'S NON-TECHNICAL DEALS WITH

00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:21,378
TRYING TO CREATE A COMPANY

00:29:21,378 --> 00:29:23,580
THAT'S BUILT ON TECHNOLOGY,
RIGHT?

00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:27,150
THE ONE CONSTANT IN ANY
TECHNOLOGY-BASED COMPANY

00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:27,517
IS WHAT?

00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:29,553
CHANGE.
CHANGE.

00:29:29,553 --> 00:29:32,222
YOU HAVE TO KNOW THE TECHNOLOGY
INSIDE AND OUT

00:29:32,222 --> 00:29:34,458
TO BE ABLE TO ANTICIPATE
WHERE THINGS ARE GOING.

00:29:34,458 --> 00:29:35,459
THAT'S NOT YOU.

00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,427
I'M OUT.

00:29:37,427 --> 00:29:38,495
OKAY.

00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:43,233
I TOTALLY TRUSTED YOU GUYS.
YOU'RE GREAT.

00:29:43,233 --> 00:29:46,169
BUT I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT.

00:29:46,169 --> 00:29:49,206
I JUST DON'T HAVE THE FAITH
THAT THIS BUSINESS WILL WORK.

00:29:49,206 --> 00:29:50,207
I'M OUT.

00:29:50,207 --> 00:29:51,174
OKAY.

00:29:51,174 --> 00:29:52,175
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

00:29:52,175 --> 00:29:54,278
I KNOW THERE'S A SENSE
OF CONCERN

00:29:54,278 --> 00:29:56,413
BECAUSE YOU'VE SHOWN ME
A VALUATION

00:29:56,413 --> 00:29:59,349
OF $2.5 MILLION
WHEN YOURS IS OVER $3 MILLION.

00:29:59,349 --> 00:30:01,151
SO YOU'RE TELLING ME,
AS AN INVESTOR,

00:30:01,151 --> 00:30:04,321
YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE DILUTION
IF I DEPLOY MY CAPITAL.

00:30:04,321 --> 00:30:06,456
YEAH, HE'S IN SO DEEP,
YOUR PANT LEGS ARE ROLLED UP
RIGHT NOW. I MEAN...

00:30:06,456 --> 00:30:08,225
WHAT IT HAS TO BE --
PHIL, THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE.

00:30:08,225 --> 00:30:10,227
Reitnour: YEAH. RIGHT.
THEY SPEAK TO ME.

00:30:10,227 --> 00:30:11,295
I'M A CASH WHISPERER.

00:30:11,295 --> 00:30:13,230
SO, YOU KNOW,
I WISH YOU GUYS LUCK,

00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:15,299
BUT I'M NOT GONNA BE PART
OF THIS JOURNEY.

00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:17,401
I'M OUT.

00:30:17,401 --> 00:30:19,136
I LIKE THE CONCEPT.

00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:21,538
I THINK ANYTHING THAT KEEPS
PEOPLE SAFER IS A GREAT THING.

00:30:21,538 --> 00:30:24,474
MM-HMM.
BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT

00:30:24,474 --> 00:30:27,344
IT'S BEING EXECUTED PROPERLY
OR NOT AT THIS POINT.
SURE.

00:30:27,344 --> 00:30:29,579
AND FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.

00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:32,349
APPRECIATE YOUR TIME
AND YOUR QUESTIONS.
THANK YOU.

00:30:32,349 --> 00:30:34,251
LET ME TELL YOU
WHAT I THINK THE MISTAKE

00:30:34,251 --> 00:30:35,452
YOU'VE MADE
UP UNTIL THIS POINT.
OKAY.

00:30:35,452 --> 00:30:37,154
YOU STARTED
WITH TOO MUCH MONEY.

00:30:37,154 --> 00:30:38,388
YEP.
OKAY.

00:30:38,388 --> 00:30:41,158
SO, I WENT BACK TO WORK
NINE YEARS AGO.

00:30:41,158 --> 00:30:42,426
I WAS A STAY-AT-HOME DAD.

00:30:42,426 --> 00:30:45,295
AND I WAS GONNA CONQUER
THE WORLD OF SECURITY,

00:30:45,295 --> 00:30:46,563
SO I OPENED UP
THE BUSINESS.

00:30:46,563 --> 00:30:48,532
WE STARTED WITH MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS,

00:30:48,532 --> 00:30:51,134
'CAUSE I KNEW <i>EVERYTHING,</i>
RIGHT?
RIGHT.

00:30:51,134 --> 00:30:53,236
OUR FORECAST WAS $5 MILLION
IN SALES.

00:30:53,236 --> 00:30:55,539
YOU KNOW WHAT WE SOLD?
$400,000.

00:30:55,539 --> 00:30:58,141
WE LOST $1 MILLION.

00:30:58,141 --> 00:31:00,410
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I SAID?
"THAT'S OKAY.

00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:02,245
LET ME PUT ANOTHER
$1 MILLION IN."

00:31:02,245 --> 00:31:03,447
THAT'S THE CURSE
OF SUCCESS.

00:31:03,447 --> 00:31:04,581
YOU GET ARROGANT THINKING
EVERYTHING YOU DO IS SMART.

00:31:04,581 --> 00:31:05,582
YEAH,
'CAUSE I KNOW <i>EVERYTHING.</i>

00:31:05,582 --> 00:31:08,485
THE BEAUTY OF NOT HAVING
A LOT OF MONEY

00:31:08,485 --> 00:31:11,288
IS YOU TRY SOMETHING,
AND THEN YOU CHANGE.

00:31:11,288 --> 00:31:15,559
AND AS MARK SAID,
NEITHER OF YOU ARE A GEEK.

00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:18,195
IF YOU'RE
A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY,

00:31:18,195 --> 00:31:21,264
YOU GOT TO HAVE
TECHNOLOGY BRAIN TRUST

00:31:21,264 --> 00:31:23,233
IN A LEADERSHIP POSITION.

00:31:23,233 --> 00:31:27,437
YOU GUYS ARE NOT THE TWO GUYS
TO EXECUTE THIS STRATEGY.

00:31:27,437 --> 00:31:28,638
O'Leary: WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
ROBERT?
I'M OUT.

00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:30,407
WELL...

00:31:30,407 --> 00:31:33,176
I THINK THAT'S IT, GUYS.
THANK YOU ALL.

00:31:33,176 --> 00:31:34,478
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
THANK YOU ALL.
APPRECIATE IT.

00:31:34,478 --> 00:31:36,413
THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME
AND ATTENTION. APPRECIATE IT.

00:31:39,483 --> 00:31:42,185
THEY SEE
THE TECHNOLOGY PITFALLS

00:31:42,185 --> 00:31:44,321
AND THE THINGS THAT WE NEED
TO IMPROVE UPON

00:31:44,321 --> 00:31:45,555
TO MAKE IT A VIABLE PRODUCT,

00:31:45,555 --> 00:31:48,158
AND I THINK THAT ADVICE,
IN AND OF ITSELF,

00:31:48,158 --> 00:31:49,593
IS GONNA BE A HUGE SUCCESS
FOR US.

00:31:57,465 --> 00:31:59,400
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
LET'S DO THIS.

00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,435
DO IT!

00:32:01,435 --> 00:32:04,238
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
ARE YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS

00:32:04,238 --> 00:32:06,240
WITH A BEVERAGE
FOR A NEW GENERATION.

00:32:11,412 --> 00:32:13,581
HEY, SHARKS.
MY NAME'S JUSTIN FENCHEL.

00:32:13,581 --> 00:32:14,615
I'M BRAD SCHULTZ.

00:32:14,615 --> 00:32:16,250
AND I'M AIMY STEADMAN,

00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:17,585
AND WE'RE FROM AUSTIN, TEXAS.

00:32:17,585 --> 00:32:19,620
OUR COMPANY IS
BeatBox BEVERAGES,

00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:23,491
AND WE'RE SEEKING $200,000
FOR 10% OF OUR COMPANY.

00:32:23,491 --> 00:32:27,528
NOW, KEVIN, YOU KNOW WINE.
SO PICTURE THIS --

00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,563
A DELIGHTFUL CABERNET

00:32:29,563 --> 00:32:31,665
FROM THE BORDEAUX REGION
OF FRANCE.

00:32:31,665 --> 00:32:34,568
IT'S BEEN AGED IN OAK BARRELS
FOR 15 YEARS.

00:32:34,568 --> 00:32:35,669
IT'S PERFECT.

00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:37,438
[ LAUGHS ]
YOU CAN ALMOST TASTE IT,
RIGHT?

00:32:37,438 --> 00:32:39,240
IF THAT'S TRUE, BRING IT OVER.

00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,541
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,343
WELL,
THERE'S JUST ONE PROBLEM.

00:32:42,343 --> 00:32:43,511
WHAT?

00:32:43,511 --> 00:32:45,579
Together: BORING!

00:32:45,579 --> 00:32:46,614
EXACTLY!

00:32:46,614 --> 00:32:47,615
[ LAUGHS ]

00:32:47,615 --> 00:32:50,351
Corcoran:
NOW WE'RE GETTING DOWN.

00:32:50,351 --> 00:32:51,485
OH.

00:32:51,485 --> 00:32:53,454
THIS IS BeatBox BEVERAGES,
AND WE ARE NOT BORING.

00:32:53,454 --> 00:32:55,189
WE'RE CHANGING BOX WINE FOREVER

00:32:55,189 --> 00:32:56,624
WITH FLAVORS LIKE
CRANBERRY LIMEADE

00:32:56,624 --> 00:32:58,359
AND BLUE-RASPBERRY LEMONADE,

00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:01,295
ALL IN ONE
SWEET-LOOKING BeatBox.

00:33:01,295 --> 00:33:02,496
BUT IT'S NOT JUST A BOX.

00:33:02,496 --> 00:33:04,265
IT'S AN EXPERIENCE.

00:33:04,265 --> 00:33:05,633
OOH.
TAKE BeatBox
TO YOUR NEXT PARTY,

00:33:05,633 --> 00:33:06,700
AND YOU'RE INSTANTLY
A LEGEND.

00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,269
[ LAUGHS ]

00:33:08,269 --> 00:33:09,703
Steadman: BOXED WINE
IS INCREDIBLY POPULAR.

00:33:09,703 --> 00:33:11,572
IT'S AFFORDABLE,
IT'S CONVENIENT,

00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:13,641
IT'S GOT A LARGE SIZE
WHERE YOU CAN SHARE

00:33:13,641 --> 00:33:15,342
WITH EVERYONE AT THE PARTY.

00:33:15,342 --> 00:33:17,711
BUT THE WINE YOU FIND INSIDE
LEAVES MUCH TO BE DESIRED.

00:33:17,711 --> 00:33:19,580
WE'RE USING
A UNIQUE ORANGE WINE

00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,349
THAT DRINKS MORE LIKE A SPIRIT
THAN A WINE

00:33:22,349 --> 00:33:24,418
AND ALLOWS US
TO CREATE MIXED DRINKS

00:33:24,418 --> 00:33:26,487
THAT OUR CUSTOMERS
ABSOLUTELY LOVE.

00:33:26,487 --> 00:33:28,289
BeatBox IS A PARTY IN A BOX,

00:33:28,289 --> 00:33:30,457
WITH ALMOST SEVEN BOTTLES OF
WINE PACKED INTO EVERY BOX.

00:33:30,457 --> 00:33:31,492
WOW.

00:33:31,492 --> 00:33:33,360
WE CREATED AN INNOVATIVE,
FUN BRAND

00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,329
THAT'S REALLY SPEAKING
TO OUR GENERATION,

00:33:35,329 --> 00:33:37,665
AND WE'RE READY TO TAKE THIS
COMPANY TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

00:33:37,665 --> 00:33:39,500
THE ONLY QUESTION IS,

00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,335
WILL THE SHARKS BE JOINING
THE BeatBox PARTY?

00:33:41,335 --> 00:33:42,636
LET'S TRY SOME!

00:33:42,636 --> 00:33:44,672
YEAH!
YEAH!

00:33:44,672 --> 00:33:46,640
WHAT IS ORANGE WINE?
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT.

00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,410
YEAH, SO, ORANGE WINE IS A --
IS A UNIQUE WINE.

00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:52,413
IT'S ACTUALLY, UH, CLEAR,
MUCH MORE LIKE A WHITE SPIRIT.

00:33:52,413 --> 00:33:54,648
THE BLUE ONE IS THE
BLUE-RASPBERRY LEMONADE.

00:33:54,648 --> 00:33:56,383
THE PINK IS
A CRANBERRY LIMEADE.

00:33:56,383 --> 00:33:59,286
THE YELLOW-ISH COLOR
IS OUR MARGARITA FLAVOR.

00:33:59,286 --> 00:34:01,221
AND THE TEA IS A SWEET TEA.

00:34:01,221 --> 00:34:04,224
THIS TASTES LIKE [BLEEP]

00:34:06,427 --> 00:34:08,629
OH, ARE YOU KIDDING?
THIS IS GOOD.

00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:11,332
HE LOVES IT!
Man: YEAH!

00:34:11,332 --> 00:34:13,233
THIS IS DELICIOUS.
HE'S CRAZY.
IT'S A PARTY.

00:34:13,233 --> 00:34:14,335
I LOVE THIS ONE.

00:34:14,335 --> 00:34:16,236
REMINDS ME OFF THOSE, LIKE

00:34:16,236 --> 00:34:17,438
BLUE-RASPBERRY SNOW CONES.

00:34:17,438 --> 00:34:19,340
HOW MUCH ALCOHOL
IS IN HERE?

00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,441
11.1%.
WHAT?!

00:34:20,441 --> 00:34:21,442
YES.
Corcoran: WOW.

00:34:21,442 --> 00:34:22,576
LORI, CHEERS.

00:34:22,576 --> 00:34:23,611
ONLY 120 CALORIES
PER SERVING.

00:34:23,611 --> 00:34:24,645
WHOO!
WHOO!

00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,413
AND ONLY 7 GRAMS OF SUGAR
PER SERVING.

00:34:26,413 --> 00:34:28,349
Herjavec: YOU KNOW WHAT?
I LOVE THE WINE.

00:34:28,349 --> 00:34:29,249
KEVIN, GIVE THEM THE MONEY.

00:34:29,249 --> 00:34:30,517
O'Leary:
NO, BUT LET'S...

00:34:30,517 --> 00:34:31,685
TELL US MORE
ABOUT THE BUSINESS.

00:34:31,685 --> 00:34:33,654
SEE, HE'S THE PARTY POOPER.
WHERE IS IT MANUFACTURED?

00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:35,289
WHAT ARE YOUR MARGINS?

00:34:35,289 --> 00:34:36,523
WHO'S ACTUALLY
DISTRIBUTING IT?

00:34:36,523 --> 00:34:38,525
SO, WE SELF-DISTRIBUTE IT.

00:34:38,525 --> 00:34:40,694
WE ACTUALLY BECAME
A WINERY OURSELVES.

00:34:40,694 --> 00:34:42,529
AS A TEXAS WINERY,
YOU CAN SELF-DISTRIBUTE IT.

00:34:42,529 --> 00:34:44,365
BUT WE GOT, YOU KNOW,
TO THE POINT

00:34:44,365 --> 00:34:46,533
WHERE WE WERE SPENDING MORE TIME
IN OUR FACILITY MAKING IT,

00:34:46,533 --> 00:34:48,602
GLUING THE BOXES,
AND DISTRIBUTING IT.

00:34:48,602 --> 00:34:50,337
WE COULDN'T MARKET IT,
RIGHT?

00:34:50,337 --> 00:34:51,372
WE'RE GETTING TOO BIG.

00:34:51,372 --> 00:34:52,573
SO WE FOUND A CO-PACKER
IN DALLAS,

00:34:52,573 --> 00:34:54,441
AND THEY NOW MAKE IT
FOR US.

00:34:54,441 --> 00:34:56,276
WE SIGNED ON
WITH A DISTRIBUTOR.

00:34:56,276 --> 00:34:58,512
SINCE THEN, WE'VE GROWN
OUR SALES PRETTY DRAMATICALLY.

00:34:58,512 --> 00:35:00,614
Herjavec: WHAT ARE YOUR SALES
SO FAR, JUSTIN?

00:35:00,614 --> 00:35:02,483
WE'VE DONE $235,000
IN 14 MONTHS,

00:35:02,483 --> 00:35:07,221
AND $120,000 IS COMING
JUST THIS QUARTER.

00:35:07,221 --> 00:35:10,424
HOW MUCH MONEY DID YOU RAISE
WHEN YOU STARTED THIS?

00:35:10,424 --> 00:35:12,526
SO -- SO, WE SELF-FUNDED IT
FOR $55,000.

00:35:12,526 --> 00:35:15,529
WE TOOK ON $100 -- $100,000
IN FAMILY AND FRIENDS' DEBT.

00:35:15,529 --> 00:35:18,599
SO TELL ME HOW YOU'RE GONNA GO
FROM $235,000 TO $5 MILLION.

00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:20,601
SO, THE STRATEGY IS
TO IDENTIFY NEW STORES

00:35:20,601 --> 00:35:22,336
WHERE WE KNOW
IT'S GONNA SELL,

00:35:22,336 --> 00:35:23,337
GO INTO THAT STORE,

00:35:23,337 --> 00:35:24,672
SUPPORT IT WITH AT LEAST
SIX TASTINGS.

00:35:24,672 --> 00:35:26,340
TASTINGS ARE BY FAR
THE BEST WAY

00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,541
FOR US TO GET
THE PRODUCT OUT THERE.

00:35:27,541 --> 00:35:28,609
WHAT DO YOU NEED
THE MONEY FOR?

00:35:28,609 --> 00:35:29,710
Fenchel: IT'S FOR THE ENGINE
FOR GROWTH.

00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,245
OPENING UP NEW STORES

00:35:31,245 --> 00:35:33,280
AND, YOU KNOW, SUPPORTING IT
WITH TASTINGS.

00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,282
OUR TASTINGS COST,
ON AVERAGE...
SO, HIRING THE PEOPLE --

00:35:35,282 --> 00:35:37,418
...$100 PER TASTING
IS ON AVERAGE INTO --

00:35:37,418 --> 00:35:38,619
THAT'S EXPENSIVE.
THAT'S EXPENSIVE.
IT IS.

00:35:40,521 --> 00:35:43,424
DOING IT IN THE STORES
SOUNDS REALLY, REALLY GOOD,

00:35:43,424 --> 00:35:45,459
BUT IT'S REALLY HARD
TO LEVERAGE.

00:35:45,459 --> 00:35:48,362
ONE STORE AT A TIME,
EVEN WITH BRAND AMBASSADORS,

00:35:48,362 --> 00:35:52,599
YOUR LEVERAGE POINTS
PER ANY ONE STORE AREN'T GREAT.

00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:54,368
IN MY MIND,
THE STRATEGY WAS WRONG.

00:35:54,368 --> 00:35:58,505
YOU KNOW, YOU NEED TO --
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF EVENTS,

00:35:58,505 --> 00:36:00,474
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF BIG,
YOU KNOW, PLACES

00:36:00,474 --> 00:36:02,242
WHERE THERE ARE THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE.

00:36:02,242 --> 00:36:04,344
FEEL LIKE WE'VE ELIMINATED
A LOT OF THE RISKS

00:36:04,344 --> 00:36:07,381
ASSOCIATED WITH A NEW
CONSUMER-PRODUCTS COMPANY
IN THIS SPACE.

00:36:07,381 --> 00:36:09,216
WE'VE GOT OUTSOURCE
MANUFACTURING,

00:36:09,216 --> 00:36:11,385
WE'VE GOT THE LARGEST
DISTRIBUTOR IN THE STATES,

00:36:11,385 --> 00:36:13,554
AND WE NEED SOMEONE TO
HELP US SCALE THIS BUSINESS.

00:36:13,554 --> 00:36:16,390
THE GOOD NEWS FOR YOU GUYS
IS THERE -- THERE'S --

00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:17,658
THERE'S EXAMPLES OF BEVERAGES

00:36:17,658 --> 00:36:20,294

AND GONE NATIONAL.

00:36:20,294 --> 00:36:22,229
YOU REMEMBER SKINNY --
THE SKINNYGIRL STORY?

00:36:22,229 --> 00:36:23,630
ABSOLUTELY.
ABSOLUTELY.

00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,599
THAT WAS THE SAME THING --
VERY VIRAL --

00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:26,533
FROM ONE LOCATION.

00:36:26,533 --> 00:36:28,335
THEN NEW YORK, FLORIDA,

00:36:28,335 --> 00:36:29,536
TEXAS, CALIFORNIA.

00:36:29,536 --> 00:36:33,240
BUT SHE RAN LIKE HELL
FOR EVERYWHERE ELSE.
YEAH.

00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,575
THE -- THE PATH
OF LEAST RESISTANCE

00:36:34,575 --> 00:36:35,609
IS CONVERTING THAT PERSON

00:36:35,609 --> 00:36:37,578
THAT'S BUYING THAT BOX OF WINE
FOR A PARTY,

00:36:37,578 --> 00:36:40,481
BUT THEY DON'T KNOW WHY
THEY'RE BUYING IT.
Herjavec: RIGHT. YEAH.

00:36:40,481 --> 00:36:42,249
THAT'S THE EASIEST
CONVERSION.

00:36:42,249 --> 00:36:43,550
AND SO, FRANZIA --
AN EXAMPLE --

00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:45,552
IS THE NUMBER-ONE BOX WINE
IN THE WORLD,

00:36:45,552 --> 00:36:46,587
NUMBER-ONE BY VOLUME.

00:36:46,587 --> 00:36:48,422
A BILLION DOLLARS
IN SALES.

00:36:48,422 --> 00:36:51,525
FRANZIA DOES $1 BILLION.
IT IS 3% --
WHAT?!

00:36:51,525 --> 00:36:52,526
BUT YOU KNOW WHY?

00:36:52,526 --> 00:36:54,428
BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT
100% PENETRATION

00:36:54,428 --> 00:36:55,462
AND DISTRIBUTION,

00:36:55,462 --> 00:36:57,397

TO KNOCK IT OFF.
