MUST GET THE FULL AMOUNT

HEAT IT OR FREEZE IT,

THOSE HAVE BEEN AROUND
FOR YEARS, RIGHT?

00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:37,150
SO YOU'RE SAYING
THIS IS A LITTLE BETTER DESIGN?

00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,252
WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT
WEARING A WEIGHT VEST

00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,254
APPLIES ALL THE WEIGHT
ON YOUR SHOULDERS.

00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:44,191
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER, I WAS ALWAYS
THE SKINNY KID IN SCHOOL. YEAH.

AND DO SHOULDER SHRUGS ON
THE WAY TO CLASS, TRYING
TO BULK UP MY SHOULDERS.

00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,164
THE PROBLEM THAT I REALIZE
IS THAT

00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:53,166
APPLYING ALL THE WEIGHT
ON YOUR SHOULDERS

00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,402
ACTUALLY RUINS YOUR POSTURE
AND CAUSES YOU TO SLOUCH.

WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
HOW MUCH MONEY YOU MAKING?

00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:00,373

I SPECIALIZE IN BIOMECHANICS,

00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,288
AND I ACTUALLY DEVELOPED THIS
WHILE I WAS IN SCHOOL.

00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:18,258
AND WHERE ARE YOU SELLING
THIS STUFF?
MAINLY ONLINE RETAILERS.

00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,161

00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:27,200
SO, LAST YEAR,
HOW MUCH DID YOU DO?

00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,102
WE DID ABOUT $600,000
IN REVENUE.

00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,971
WHAT DID YOU NET
OFF OF THAT?

00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:32,973
LAST YEAR
WAS AN INTERESTING STORY.

00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:36,042
IN 2012, I ACTUALLY CLOSED A
DEAL WITH A VENTURE CAPITALIST.

00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:39,045
THEY DECIDED THAT IT WAS IN
THE BEST INTEREST OF THE COMPANY

00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:41,248
FOR US TO ACTUALLY BRING ON
AN EXECUTIVE CHAIR.

00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:44,151
WE BURNED THROUGH THE ENTIRE
INVESTMENT WITHIN SIX MONTHS.

00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:45,352
HOW MUCH
WAS THE INVESTMENT?

00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:47,320
IT WAS ABOUT $1 MILLION.

00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,024
WHAT -- THIS GUY BLEW THROUGH
THE MONEY. WHAT DID HE DO WRONG?

00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,292
THERE WERE CHARGES THAT

00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,060
I WOULDN'T HAVE --
I WOULDN'T HAVE MADE.

00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,062
THERE WERE DECISIONS THAT
I PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE MADE.

00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:59,065
HOWEVER, AS OF LAST WEEK,
I ACTUALLY BOUGHT THEM OUT.

00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:01,334
OKAY. WHERE DID YOU GET
THE CAPITAL TO BUY THEM OUT?
ACTUALLY FROM SALES.

00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,203
WE'RE ABOUT 30% NET PROFIT.

00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:04,304
DO YOU HAVE ANY DEBT?

00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,305
WE HAVE NO DEBT.

00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,207
DO YOU OWN 100%
OF THE EQUITY NOW?

00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:10,143
BETWEEN ME AND MY FATHER,
WE OWN 100% OF THE EQUITY.

00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,312
WHAT WILL THE SALES BE
THIS YEAR, PATRICK?

00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,047
WE'RE LOOKING AT BREAKING
$10 MILLION THIS YEAR.

00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,016
WOW.
POSSIBLY $16 MILLION,
DEPENDING ON INVENTORY.

00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,384
I MEAN, RIGHT NOW,
WE'RE SOLD OUT.

00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:20,020
John: YOU'RE GONNA BREAK
$10 MILLION THIS YEAR?

00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,121
EASILY, YEAH.
EASILY?

00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,389
SO, WHO'S
YOUR PRIMARY CUSTOMER?

00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:24,090
THE MILITARY AND CrossFit.

00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,293
AND THEY'RE WILLING TO PAY
HOW MUCH FOR A SHIRT?

00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:30,063
RIGHT NOW, WE SELL
A THREE-PART SYSTEM FOR $250.

00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,464
IT COMES AS A COVER SHIRT,
A POCKET SHIRT,

00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:32,999
AND A FULL SET OF GEL.

00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,035
HOW MUCH DO YOU SELL IT
TO THE STORES FOR?

00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,169
$137 OR SO.

00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,337
WHY DO YOU THINK
THAT YOU'RE GONNA

00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,005
HOCKEY-STICK
TO $10 MILLION?

00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,241
WE HAVE ABOUT $1.4 MILLION

00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:43,243
OF PURCHASE ORDERS
THAT I CAN'T FULFILL,

00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:45,078
AND THE REASON
IS BECAUSE I'M TAKING

00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,313
ALL THE PROFIT TO THEN BUY OUT

00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:49,082
MY INVESTORS AND TRY TO --
TRY TO GET A CLEAN SLATE.

00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:51,284
I'M STRUGGLING WITH YOUR
$10-MILLION VALUATION.

00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:55,455
IT'S ALL BASED ON YOU HITTING
A STRATOSPHERIC GROWTH RATE.

00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,324
WE'VE ALREADY HIT IT.
WE'VE HAD --

00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:59,292
WELL, YOU HAVEN'T HIT IT.
YOU HAVEN'T HIT IT.

00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,294
AND SO I HAVE TO PAY
FOR NEXT YEAR'S SALES

00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,230
AS IF THEY'VE ALREADY
OCCURRED TODAY.

00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,299
LOOK, PATRICK, MY B.S. METER
IS GOING THROUGH THE ROOF.

00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,101
BECAUSE I SAY,
"YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:11,304
I WANT ALL MY GUYS ON THE
MAVERICKS TO JUMP 13% HIGHER."

00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,206
OKAY, GREAT.

00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,342
I BRING YOU TO THE MAVERICKS,
SIT WITH MY DOCTOR.

00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:17,410
"PATRICK SAYS
HE CAN INCREASE

00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,347
OUR VERTICAL LEAPS OF ALL OF OUR
PLAYERS BY 13%."

00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:21,381
THAT'S THE TRUTH?

00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,351
YEAH, THE RESEARCH STUDIES
ARE PROVEN.

00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:27,153
WE'VE HAD STUDIES
FROM TEXAS TECH,

00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,289
PENN STATE,
MULTIPLE OTHER UNIVERSITIES.

00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:31,324
AND WHAT WAS
THE RESEARCH INTO?

00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,226
USING WEIGHT
TO INCREASE MAX VERT

00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,494
OR TO INCREASE YOUR MAX VO2 --

00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:37,097
THAT'S NOTHING NEW.
THAT'S LIKE -- THAT'S ANYTHING.

00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:39,099
BUT WHAT WE'VE DONE
IS WE'VE MADE IT BETTER.

00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:42,002
AGAIN, YOU GAVE ME
AN ANECDOTAL EXAMPLE, RIGHT?
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT. YEAH.

00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:43,270
WHY NOT
GET SOMEBODY TO SAY,

00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,272
"THIS IS WHY
WE'RE A BETTER SOLUTION"?

00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:48,108
WE ARE GETTING THAT RESEARCH
FROM MULTIPLE UNIVERSITIES.

00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:50,010
SEE, MY [BLEEP] METER'S
GOING NUTS!

00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,279
RIGHT? BECAUSE
WHY NOT JUST HAVE

00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:56,149
ONE UNIVERSITY STUDY IT IN-DEPTH
AND COME BACK WITH AN ANSWER?

00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,984
BUT WHEN YOU SAY,
"THIS UNIVERSITY, THIS --"

00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,419
BUT IT'S ALSO
A MARKETING EFFORT, AS WELL.

00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,122
WE'RE NOW EXPOSING
MORE UNIVERSITIES

00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:03,189
AND MORE COLLEGES...

AROUND THE BELT LOOP,

I'VE BEEN LEARNING,

THE BUSINESS IS DECLINING,

WE'RE FOCUSING ONLINE.

00:37:50,335 --> 00:37:54,973
IF A PRODUCT IS A GREAT PRODUCT,
WHETHER THE MARKET'S CRASHED,

00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:58,209
ECONOMY'S BAD,
A GOOD PRODUCT SURVIVES

00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:00,979

CONTINUES TO THRIVE.

WORKING, BUT I'M GONNA DO THIS.

"I DON'T CARE WHAT OBSTACLES
ARE IN MY WAY.

00:38:17,996 --> 00:38:21,432
IT'S NOT WHO'S GOING TO LET ME,
IT'S WHO'S GOING TO <i>STOP</i> ME."

WHERE I'M AT.

00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:30,108
THERE ARE TWO TYPES
OF WARRIORS.

00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:32,277
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WANT
TO SIT ON TOP OF THE HILL

00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:34,212
AND BE STRATEGIC,
AND THERE ARE PEOPLE

THE OPPORTUNITY.

YOU TELL IN LIFE ARE THE ONES

00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:16,120

YOU'RE SELLING YOURSELF.
