00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:09,309
I'M A FORMER
UNITED STATES MARINE.

00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:10,978
HOO-RAH!

00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:13,280
[ DOG BARKS ]
[ GASPS ]

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,348
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?

00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,116
WE ONLY MADE $375.

00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,452
OOH.
HOW MANY DID YOU SELL
LAST MONTH?

00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:20,020
PROBABLY LIKE 40.

00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,154
HOW DID YOU EVEN GET HERE?

00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:23,323
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU AN OFFER.

00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:25,158
THAT IS A BIG MISTAKE.

00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:26,426
GO BEAT HIM UP.

00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:29,396
LIFE IS FULL OF OBSTACLES
AND FAILURES,

00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,431
AND WHEN WE FACE THAT,
WE DON'T GIVE UP.

00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:34,234
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IT TAKES
LIKE A S.E.A.L. DOES.

00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:36,303
THANK YOU FOR SERVING
OUR COUNTRY.
THANK YOU.

00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:37,437

WHO ARE THE SHARKS?

00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:55,389
THEY'RE SELF-MADE
BUSINESS EXPERTS WORTH BILLIONS.

00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:58,325
KEVIN O'LEARY IS A SHREWD
VENTURE CAPITALIST

00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:00,193
WHO MADE HIS FORTUNE

00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:02,129
SELLING A CHILDREN'S
EDUCATIONAL COMPANY

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,398
FOR OVER $4 BILLION.

00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:08,302
DAYMOND JOHN DOMINATED
THE FASHION WORLD WITH FUBU.

NOW HE'S THE BRANDING EXPERT
BEHIND MULTIPLE GLOBAL BRANDS

00:01:11,338 --> 00:01:13,373

ROBERT HERJAVEC, SON OF
AN IMMIGRANT FACTORY WORKER,

00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:18,979
FOUNDED ONE OF

00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:22,316
THE WORLD'S PREEMINENT
CYBER-SECURITY FIRMS.

00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:26,386
LORI GREINER, THE QUEEN OF QVC,
HOLDS OVER 100 PATENTS

00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,121
AND HAS LAUNCHED
OVER 400 PRODUCTS,

00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:31,291
GROSSING OVER A HALF A BILLION
DOLLARS IN SALES.

AND THE OUTSPOKEN OWNER
OF THE DALLAS MAVERICKS.

00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:49,309
MY NAME IS ASHLEY DRAKE, AND
I'M FROM LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.

00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:52,245
I'M AN ACTIVE-DUTY OFFICER
IN THE UNITED STATES ARMY.

00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:56,049
CURRENTLY, I'M A CAPTAIN WITH
THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS.

00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,218
IN 2007,
WE WERE DEPLOYED TO IRAQ.

00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,087
I DID 15 MONTHS OVERSEAS.

00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:02,255
IT WAS A VERY REWARDING
EXPERIENCE

00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:06,059
BEING AT THE TIP OF THE SPEAR,
ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISHING MISSIONS.

00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:08,462
AND I REALLY BELIEVE
THAT WE MADE A DIFFERENCE.

00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,030
Man: LET'S GO!

00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,299
FOR ME, PHYSICAL FITNESS
IS VERY IMPORTANT

00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,968
NOT ONLY FOR MY CAREER
IN THE MILITARY,

00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,004
BUT ALSO JUST TO STAY HEALTHY

00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:19,239
AND THE BEST THAT I CAN BE
FOR MY FAMILY.

00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,141
I WAS DOING A LOT OF TRAINING
TO STAY IN SHAPE.

00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,076
KEEP GOING, KEEP GOING.

00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:25,112
WHEN YOU DO
HIGH-INTENSITY WORKOUTS,

00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:28,181
YOU NEED THE RIGHT GEAR TO
PROTECT YOU AND PREVENT INJURY.

00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:30,017
Man: HOW MANY ORDERS
DO WE HAVE TO DO TONIGHT?

00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:31,051

00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:32,285
AS USUAL.
[ LAUGHS ]

00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:35,222
THIS COMPANY IS GROWING FASTER
THAN I EVER THOUGHT IT WOULD,

00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:37,457
AND WE CANNOT KEEP UP
WITH THE DEMAND.

00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,292
WE BELIEVE IN THIS SO MUCH

00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,228
THAT MY HUSBAND
LEFT HIS FULL-TIME JOB

00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:43,397
SO THAT HE COULD TAKE ON
THE COMPANY FULL TIME.

00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:45,098
PUSH, PUSH, PUSH!

00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:47,367
WE NEED TO FORM A STRATEGIC
PARTNERSHIP WITH A SHARK.

00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:51,438
I KNOW THAT APPLYING THE YEARS
OF DEDICATION AND DETERMINATION

00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:53,240
THAT I'VE LEARNED IN THE SERVICE

00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,409
CAN REALLY MAKE THIS DREAM
A REALITY.

00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:15,295
HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS ASHLEY DRAKE,

00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:20,167
AND YOU -- ALL OF YOU --
NEED TO GET A GRIP...

00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:23,136
...THE NATURAL GRIP.

00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:28,308
I'M SEEKING A $100,000
FOR 20% EQUITY IN MY COMPANY.

00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:31,378
DO YOU WANT YOUR HANDS
TO LOOK LIKE THIS

00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,948
WHEN YOU GET DONE WORKING OUT?
NO!

00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,083
NOBODY DOES.

00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,252
AND MY PRODUCT
PREVENTS THIS PROBLEM.

00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:42,422
YES, THERE ARE OTHER
HAND-PROTECTION DEVICES

00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:43,423
ON THE MARKET.

00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,358
THEY'RE LEATHER, THEY'RE CLOTH,

00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,994
THEY'RE NYLON,
AND THEY DON'T WORK.

00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,129
AND DO YOU KNOW WHY?

00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:52,232
BECAUSE THEY SLIP OFF
YOUR HANDS, THEY'RE BULKY,

00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,434
AND THEY HINDER YOUR PERFORMANCE
IN THE GYM.

00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,036
NOT THE NATURAL GRIP.

00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:59,072
WE ARE THE ONLY CUSTOM
HAND GRIP ON THE MARKET.

00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:02,175
OUR GRIP IS BASED OFF
OF YOUR RING-FINGER SIZE.

00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,978
AND WE ARE THE ONLY
REUSABLE TAPE GRIP.

00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:06,379
SO LET ME SHOW YOU HOW IT WORKS.

00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:09,282
ONE OF OUR SPONSORED ATHLETES,
DANIELLE SIDELL,

00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,284
WILL NOW PERFORM
THE CLEAN AND JERK.

00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:14,321
SHE HAS JUST 165 POUNDS
ON THE BAR, NO BIG DEAL.

00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:17,190
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE
TO WEAR GRIPS DURING THIS

00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,458
BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE

00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,361
THEY CANNOT HAVE PROPER CONTROL
OF THE BAR

00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:24,097
AND GET IT OVER THE HEAD SAFELY.
Man: WOW.

00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,366
DANIELLE DOESN'T HAVE
THAT PROBLEM.

00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,367
Greiner: WOW.

00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,102
THERE YOU GO.
GOOD JOB, DANIELLE.

00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,303
IMPRESSIVE.

00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:32,372
SO NOW SHE'S GOING TO DO
SOME BAR MUSCLE-UPS.

00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:35,342
NOW, BAR MUSCLE-UPS ARE
A VERY COMPLEX MOVEMENT.

00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:39,112
WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT THEIR HANDS
START TO RIP AND TEAR OPEN

00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,214
SO THEY HAVE TO DROP
FROM THE BAR.

00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,415
NOT DANIELLE.

00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:45,485
IN FACT, SHE'S ABLE TO GO
FROM THE BAR MUSCLE-UP

00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:49,055
STRAIGHT INTO KIPPING PULL-UPS
WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM.

00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,390
THAT IS NOT TYPICAL.

00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,359
YEAH, YOU THINK?
WHY? BECAUSE HER --

00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:55,128
[ LAUGHS ]
WELL, BECAUSE OF HER HANDS.

00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,329
THAT'S WHY.

00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:59,099
BECAUSE THEY'RE PROTECTED,
AND SHE FEELS SAFE ON THE BAR.

00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:01,001
SO I HAVE SOME CUSTOM GRIPS
FOR YOU.

00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,969
ARE YOU SAYING
IF KEVIN PUT THAT ON,

00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,337
HE COULD DO
EVERYTHING SHE DID?

00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:06,006
I MEAN, I'M NOT GUARA--

00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:07,440
YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO?
GO BEAT HIM UP.

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,142
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,379
ROBERT, YOU HAVE THE CUSTOM
DANIELLE SIDELL NATURAL GRIP.

00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:14,047
LORI, PINK.

00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,349
I MEAN, WHAT FEMALE DOESN'T
LIKE TO WORK OUT IN PINK?

00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:19,119
KEVIN, THIS IS THE COLOR
OF YOUR SOUL -- BLACK.

00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:22,022
[ LAUGHTER ]
OH, YEAH.

00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:25,091
DAYMOND, BACK TO YOUR
FUBU ROOTS -- RED AND BLACK.

00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,359
AND MARK --
I MEAN, SHOULD I SAY IT?
THANK YOU.

00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,228
YEAH.
Herjavec: ASHLEY, HOW
DO YOU PUT THEM ON?

00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:31,198
YOU JUST PUT THEM OVER YOUR RING
FINGER AND YOUR MIDDLE FINGER.

00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:32,465
AND THEN
HOW DOES IT ATTACH?

00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:34,234
IS THERE A STRAP
THAT GOES --

00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:39,005
WELL, YOU CAN ATTACH IT WITH OUR
CUSTOM NATURAL GRIP GOAT TAPE,

00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,340
WHICH WE'LL SELL YOU
FOR $7 A ROLL.

00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,374
I LIKE THE UP-SELL.

00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,076
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:46,012
OR YOU CAN -- YOU CAN ATTACH IT
WITH YOUR OWN WRIST WRAPS.

00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,047
SO WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS,

00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:48,248
I WANT YOU TO PUT GIVE
IN THE GRIP.

00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:49,983
SO YOU SEE HOW YOU KIND OF ARC
YOUR HARD LIKE THAT RIGHT THERE.

00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,352
OKAY.

00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,386
FEELS REALLY GOOD.

00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,188
MM-HMM.
IT'S VERY FLEXIBLE.

00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,456
ARE YOU COMING UP HERE
WITH ME?

00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:58,258
YEAH, I'LL COME UP.
I'LL TRY IT.

00:05:58,258 --> 00:05:59,359
I SEE A HERNIA.

00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,393
EASY.

00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,095
THERE YOU GO, ROBERT.
GOOD JOB, BUDDY.

00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,064
YOU DID BETTER THAN I DO.
Drake: GOOD JOB.

00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:05,198
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,033
O'Leary: THERE YOU GO.
HOW DO YOUR HANDS FEEL?

00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,036
THIS IS REALLY GOOD.
THE GRIPS ARE AMAZING.

00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,338
HE CAN GO ALL DAY.
Drake: THAT'S WHY SALES
ARE SO GOOD.

00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:12,405
Cuban:
THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.
GOOD JOB.

00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:15,041
John: GOOD JOB, ROB.
ALL RIGHT.

00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,377
SO, SHARKS, YOU CAN RIP,
YOU CAN TEAR,

00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,080
YOU CAN BLEED
ALL OVER THE PLACE,

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,215
OR YOU CAN GET THE NATURAL GRIP.

00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:26,486
SO WHO'S READY TO STOP THE PAIN
AND SEE THE GAINS?

00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:29,055
WHAT ARE YOUR QUESTIONS?

00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,223
O'Leary: WELL, QUESTIONS
ARE ABOUT MONEY.

00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,158
SO, YOU PUT A VALUE ON THIS
FOR $500,000.

00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:34,294
THAT MEANS YOU MUST HAVE
SOME SALES OR YOU'RE CRAZY.

00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:36,162
WHICH ONE IS IT?
I HAVE SALES.
ALL RIGHT.

00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:39,366
SO, THE NATURAL GRIP'S ONLY BEEN
IN EXISTENCE FOR A YEAR NOW,

00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:42,068
AND WE HAVE $178,000 IN SALES.

00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,203
GOOD FOR YOU.
THAT'S GOOD.

00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:44,371
WHAT WAS YOUR
FULL-TIME JOB?

00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:46,172
WHAT DID YOU DO
BEFORE YOU DID THIS?

00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,008
OKAY, SO, MY FULL-TIME JOB
IS I'M ACTIVE-DUTY ARMY.

00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:49,009
WOW.

00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,210
HOW DID YOU EVEN GET HERE?
John: YEAH.

00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,444
WHAT -- WHY THIS?
WHY DID YOU CREATE IT?

00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:56,116
I STARTED CrossFit IN 2012,
AND I STARTED RIPPING MY HANDS,

00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:58,218
AND I WAS SO DEVASTATED,
BECAUSE WHEN YOU RIP YOUR HANDS,

00:06:58,218 --> 00:06:59,352
YOU'RE OUT OF THE GYM

00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,288
FOR AT LEAST THREE OR FOUR DAYS
WHILE YOU HEAL.

00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:03,423
SO I TRIED TO FIND SOMETHING
TO FIX THE PROBLEM,

00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,058
AND NONE OF IT WAS WORKING.

00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:08,128
MY HUSBAND GOT SICK
OF HEARING ME COMPLAIN ABOUT IT,

00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:09,996
AND HE SAID, "I THINK
I CAN MAKE YOU SOMETHING

00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,197
THAT'LL FIX THIS PROBLEM."

00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:14,234
AND WE DIDN'T KNOW IT THEN,
BUT THE NATURAL GRIP WAS BORN.

00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,069
I'M CURIOUS. WHY DON'T
THE OTHER PRODUCTS WORK?

00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,304
'CAUSE THERE ARE A LOT
OF OTHER PRODUCTS.

00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:20,373
SO THE OTHER GRIPS ARE LEATHER,
SO THEY'RE BULKY.

00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:23,143
THEY'RE NYLON OR CLOTH,
SO THEY'RE SLICK.

00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:26,313
SO WHAT'S PROPRIETARY
ABOUT YOURS IS THE MATERIAL.

00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:28,148
NO. WHAT'S PROPRIETARY
ABOUT MINE,

00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:30,050
AND WHAT I HAVE
A PATENT PENDING ON,

00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,252
IS THE METHOD
OF A REUSABLE TAPE GRIP

00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:34,120
BASED OFF OF RING-FINGER SIZE.

00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,322
WHAT -- WHAT MATERIAL
IS THIS?

00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:38,058
THAT IS 100% COTTON
ADHESIVE MATERIAL.

00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:40,160
HOW MUCH ARE YOU SELLING
THESE UNITS FOR?

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,062
SO, RIGHT NOW
WE'RE ON A DISTRIBUTOR MODEL.

00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:43,396
WE SELL TO DISTRIBUTORS
FOR $10 A UNIT,

00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:46,266
AND THEN THEY RESELL IT
FOR $17 A UNIT.

00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:47,267
HOW MANY UNITS
HAVE YOU SOLD NOW?

00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:49,169
I'VE SOLD 13,000 UNITS.

00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,403
WHAT DOES IT COST
FOR EACH PACKAGE?

00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:54,374
SO, EACH UNIT COSTS ME
$4.43 TO MAKE.

00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:57,277
$4 OF THE $4.43 IS LABOR.

00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:59,212

00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:02,215

00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:05,251
HIGH-SCHOOL KIDS, RETIREES,
PEOPLE THAT NEEDED WORK.

00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:08,355
AND I SAID, "I WILL TRAIN YOU.
TAKE MY MATERIAL.

00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:11,091

WHEN YOU DROP OFF."

JUST CrossFitters?

00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,365

OUTSIDE OF CrossFit?

00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,100

Herjavec: SO,
ASHLEY, YOUR PROBLEM IS

00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:48,995
YOU NEED THE MONEY TO BUILD
INVENTORY TO FILL DEMAND.

00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:52,265

MORE EFFICIENTLY AND TO --

00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,200
TO GET MORE OF THEM
TO BUILD INVENTORY

00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,436

MY DISTRIBUTORS FOR THOUSANDS,

THE TURN-AROUND TIME NOW?

WITH THE CURRENT 6-MAN STAFF,
I CAN DO 3,000 UNITS A MONTH.

TO YOUR BUSINESS.

SOMETHING'S WORKING.

BUT FOR ME,
I CAN'T GET EXCITED ABOUT IT

00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:14,354

IT IS. I'M OUT.

IF WE CAN KEEP UP WITH DEMAND,

00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:28,101
WE WILL GROSS $400,000
IN -- IN SALES THIS YEAR.

00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:30,203
BUT IN 2015, IF WE CAN KEEP UP
WITH THE DEMAND,

00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:32,105
WE WILL -- WE WILL HIT
$1 MILLION IN SALES.

00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:34,274
WHY? BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY
I'M TARGETING TO RIGHT NOW

I HAVE A PRODUCT THAT WEARS OUT
THAT YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT AGAIN,

00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,114
THEN I CAN EXPAND
OUTSIDE OF CrossFit.

00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:44,084
I DON'T THINK YOU WANT
TO EXPAND OUTSIDE OF CrossFit.

00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,218
THAT'S NOT
THE OPPORTUNITY.

00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:47,187

YOUR CREDIBILITY

00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:51,024

00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:55,061

OUT THERE, I'M OPEN TO THAT.

BUT WHAT I DIDN'T SEE WAS
WHAT'S NEXT, RIGHT?

00:11:25,122 --> 00:11:28,025

TO HEAR WAS,

00:11:28,025 --> 00:11:30,127
"AFTER THIS PRODUCT,

00:21:44,274 --> 00:21:49,045
BUT EVEN AT $800,000,
AS AN INVESTABLE BUSINESS,

00:21:49,045 --> 00:21:52,348
IT'S VERY, VERY DIFFICULT
TO SCALE THAT KIND OF THING.

00:21:52,348 --> 00:21:56,986
IF WE 9 NINE DOGS A MONTH,
72 DOGS A YEAR...

00:21:56,986 --> 00:21:58,421
YEAH, BUT, LORI, HERE'S --
...WE'RE LOOKING
AT $2.4 MILLION.

00:21:58,421 --> 00:22:00,390
YEAH, HERE'S THE CHALLENGE.
IT'S YOU.

00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:03,259
IT'S SUCH A HANDS-ON
TYPE OF BUSINESS.

00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:06,129
A WEAPON LIKE THAT
IS HIGHLY, HIGHLY TRAINED

00:22:06,129 --> 00:22:09,432
THAT NEEDS PEOPLE LIKE YOU
TO CONSTANTLY RETUNE IT.

00:22:09,432 --> 00:22:12,001
AND WE DO THAT.
YEAH, ACTUALLY, THAT'S --

00:22:12,001 --> 00:22:14,404
BUT AGAIN, IT GOES TO MY POINT.
IT'S YOU.

00:22:14,404 --> 00:22:18,041
I DON'T THINK YOU FOUND
AN INVESTOR IN ME TODAY.

00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:21,177
PERHAPS A CUSTOMER.
I'M OUT.

00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:27,116
IF YOU GOT THIS UP
TO $1 MILLION IN SALES,

00:22:27,116 --> 00:22:29,118
WHICH I THINK YOU COULD...
YEAH.

00:22:29,118 --> 00:22:31,321
...IT'S NOT REALLY INTERESTING
FOR AN INVESTOR.

00:22:31,321 --> 00:22:33,289
WE HAVE DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES

00:22:33,289 --> 00:22:35,325
TO PUT OUR CAPITAL
IN MAY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.

00:22:35,325 --> 00:22:37,126
WE LOOK FOR
UNLIMITED SCALABILITY.

00:22:37,126 --> 00:22:39,362
I-I DON'T SEE IT HERE.
I'M OUT.

00:22:39,362 --> 00:22:42,165
I'M SORRY TO HEAR YOU
SAY THAT, KEVIN.

00:22:42,165 --> 00:22:44,267
WE REALLY NEED A PARTNER
TO HELP US HERE.

00:22:44,267 --> 00:22:46,436
WE'RE NOT -- I JUST --
I JUST BEEN A MARINE,

00:22:46,436 --> 00:22:48,004
A POLICE OFFICER, AND A DOG
TRAINER MY WHOLE LIFE.

00:22:48,004 --> 00:22:49,038
I NEED SOMEBODY

00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:50,240
WITH THAT LITTLE BIT
OF EXTRA BUSINESS SENSE

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,375
TO HELP US TAKE THIS -- THIS
BUSINESS TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:54,010
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:55,979
MAYBE IT WON'T BE A $5 MILLION
OR $10 MILLION COMPANY.

00:22:55,979 --> 00:22:57,313
MAYBE WE DO $2 MILLION.
BUT HOW --

00:22:57,313 --> 00:22:59,082
BUT YOU MAY GET TO $2 MILLION
ON YOUR OWN,

00:22:59,082 --> 00:23:00,316
AND THAT'S A GREAT LIVING
FOR YOU GUYS.

00:23:00,316 --> 00:23:04,053
Cuban: THERE'S DIFFERENT TYPES
OF INVESTMENTS.

00:23:04,053 --> 00:23:06,189
FOR SOME, THEY JUST NEED
THE CASH, RIGHT?

00:23:06,189 --> 00:23:08,324
AND FOR OTHERS,
THEY WANT CONTACTS

00:23:08,324 --> 00:23:10,193
AND EXPERTISE AND MENTORING.

00:23:10,193 --> 00:23:12,228
CONTACTS, EXPERTISE,
AND MENTORING IS EXPENSIVE

00:23:12,228 --> 00:23:13,296
FROM OUR END,

00:23:13,296 --> 00:23:16,199
AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT
GETTING TO $2 MILLION

00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:18,468
RELATIVE TO OUR TIME,
IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

00:23:18,468 --> 00:23:22,305
IT'S GONNA TAKE MORE TIME
THAN THE REWARD WOULD BE,

00:23:22,305 --> 00:23:24,240
AND FOR THOSE REASONS, I'M OUT.

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,009
THANK YOU, SIR.
APPRECIATE IT.

00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:27,410
THANK YOU.

00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,946
Greiner:
YOU GUYS ARE REALLY IMPRESSIVE.

00:23:29,946 --> 00:23:31,948
I COULD TELL THE MINUTE
YOU WALKED IN

00:23:31,948 --> 00:23:33,216
YOU HAD A MILITARY BACKGROUND.

00:23:33,216 --> 00:23:36,219
YOU CALLED EVERYBODY "SIR"
CONSTANTLY, KEPT YOUR COOL.

00:23:36,219 --> 00:23:39,188
I THINK TO THE POINT
THE OTHER SHARKS ARE SAYING

00:23:39,188 --> 00:23:41,424
IS YOU DON'T HAVE TO SCALE IT
REALLY HUGE.

00:23:41,424 --> 00:23:44,494
IF YOU MAKE A GREAT LIVING
OFF IT, THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED,

00:23:44,494 --> 00:23:46,429
AND I DON'T SAY THAT VERY OFTEN.

00:23:46,429 --> 00:23:49,999
IT WOULD BE HARD FOR US
TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY FROM IT

00:23:49,999 --> 00:23:52,468
OR TO BE ABLE
TO CONTRIBUTE TO YOU.

00:23:52,468 --> 00:23:54,404
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.

00:23:54,404 --> 00:23:56,406
BUT I SEE YOU AS WINNERS.

00:23:56,406 --> 00:23:58,341
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, MA'AM.
I APPRECIATE THAT.

A HUGE DOG LOVER.

AND IF YOU CAN COME OVER AND
TEACH LITTLE BLAKE AND SPARTAN

00:24:05,148 --> 00:24:08,151
TO PEE ON THE WEE-WEE PAD,
I WOULD SAY SO MANY THINGS.
HIS CHIHUAHUA.

00:24:08,151 --> 00:24:09,152
DONE.

00:24:09,152 --> 00:24:10,386
I'M NOT SURE
THOSE ARE DOGS.

00:24:10,386 --> 00:24:12,088
THEY ARE.
THEY'RE LITTLE HOT DOGS.

00:24:12,088 --> 00:24:16,092
SO I'M A PRODUCT GUY,
AND, YOU KNOW,

00:24:16,092 --> 00:24:19,095
MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION,
LICENSING.

00:24:19,095 --> 00:24:22,198
I DON'T THINK I CAN HELP YOU
IN THAT SERVICE.

00:24:22,198 --> 00:24:25,101
YOU CAN. YOU CAN.
YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY HELP US.

00:24:25,101 --> 00:24:28,171
BUT I CAN'T TURN YOUR BUSINESS
INTO A BIG BUSINESS

00:24:28,171 --> 00:24:30,373
WHERE I CAN GET ACTUALLY
A RETURN ON MY CAPITAL.

00:24:30,373 --> 00:24:31,374
I'M OUT.

00:24:33,176 --> 00:24:35,011
WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR YOUR TIME.

00:24:35,011 --> 00:24:36,112
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

00:24:36,112 --> 00:24:38,047
THIS HAS BEEN AN ABSOLUTELY
AWESOME EXPERIENCE FOR US.

00:24:38,047 --> 00:24:39,215
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR SUCCESS.

00:24:39,215 --> 00:24:40,383
YOU GUYS HAVE
A GREAT BUSINESS.
GREAT JOB.

00:24:40,383 --> 00:24:41,951
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.

00:24:41,951 --> 00:24:44,120
I WANT THE KILLER CHIHUAHUA
TO TAKE HIM OUT.

[ LAUGHTER ]

00:24:45,188 --> 00:24:46,389
Greiner: GOOD LUCK.
Cuban: CONGRATS, GUYS.

00:24:46,389 --> 00:24:48,024
Wade: THANKS.
APPRECIATE IT.

00:24:48,024 --> 00:24:49,459
THAT IS SO YOUR BUSINESS.
O'Leary: ARE YOU KIDDING?

00:24:49,459 --> 00:24:52,128
A DOG THAT WILL CUT
YOUR THROAT OPEN.
IF THAT WAS AROUND
WITH YOUNG KIDS

00:24:52,128 --> 00:24:54,097
AND IT JUST HAD A BAD HAIR DAY,
IT WOULD EAT SOMEBODY'S HEAD.

00:24:54,097 --> 00:24:55,198
[ LAUGHS ]

00:24:55,198 --> 00:24:56,332
Wade:
OUR GOAL WAS TO COME IN

00:24:56,332 --> 00:24:58,234
AND SHOW THE SHARKS
A DIFFERENT TYPE OF BUSINESS,

00:24:58,234 --> 00:24:59,335
KIND OF BLOW
THEIR DOORS OFF.

00:24:59,335 --> 00:25:01,304
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY,
THEY DIDN'T SEE IT THAT WAY.

00:25:01,304 --> 00:25:03,339
LITTLE BUMMED.
AND DISAPPOINTED.

00:25:03,339 --> 00:25:04,340
YEAH.
YEAH.

NEXT UP IS AN ENTREPRENEUR

00:25:16,085 --> 00:25:19,288
WITH A BETTER VERSION
OF THE MODERN MAN BAG.

00:25:27,997 --> 00:25:29,365
HI.
MY NAME'S AARON TWEEDIE,

00:25:29,365 --> 00:25:31,401
AND I'M FROM FRONT ROYAL,
VIRGINIA.

00:25:31,401 --> 00:25:33,236
I'M HERE TODAY SEEKING $200,000

00:25:33,236 --> 00:25:36,005
FOR A 29% STAKE IN MY COMPANY,
MAN-PACK.

00:25:36,005 --> 00:25:40,009
THE MAN-PACK IS A SLING-STYLE
VERTICAL MESSENGER BAG

00:25:40,009 --> 00:25:41,277
DESIGNED BY GUYS, FOR GUYS.

00:25:41,277 --> 00:25:43,012
YOU KNOW, 40 YEARS AGO,

00:25:43,012 --> 00:25:45,181
MEN CARRIED NOTHING MORE
THAN A MONEY CLIP,

00:25:45,181 --> 00:25:46,416
BUT TIMES HAVE CHANGED.

00:25:46,416 --> 00:25:50,086
ON AVERAGE, GUYS NOW CARRY
4.5 POUNDS OF STUFF,

00:25:50,086 --> 00:25:53,222
THINGS LIKE KEYS, CELLPHONES,
TABLETS, ENERGY DRINKS.

00:25:53,222 --> 00:25:55,391
POINT IS, GUYS NEED
TO CARRY STUFF,

00:25:55,391 --> 00:25:57,260
AND WE HAVE VERY FEW OPTIONS.

00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,228
WE HAVE THE BACKPACK,
THE BRIEFCASE,

00:25:59,228 --> 00:26:01,064
THE TRADITIONAL MESSENGER BAG,

00:26:01,064 --> 00:26:02,432
AND I'M SURE ALL OF YOU
REMEMBER THE FANNY PACK.

00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:05,334
I HAVE DESIGNED
A SUPERIOR PRODUCT

00:26:05,334 --> 00:26:07,003
THAT I CALL URBAN TACTICAL.

00:26:07,003 --> 00:26:08,471
YOU CAN WEAR THIS THING
THREE DIFFERENT WAYS.

00:26:08,471 --> 00:26:10,173
FIRST WAY IS BANDOLEER STYLE.

00:26:10,173 --> 00:26:12,041
IF YOU NEED
TO TAKE IT OFF QUICKLY,

00:26:12,041 --> 00:26:13,176
IT HAS A QUICK-RELEASE CLASP.

00:26:13,176 --> 00:26:16,179
A CHEST-MOUNTED UTILITY POCKET
FOR YOUR CELLPHONE

00:26:16,179 --> 00:26:17,980
WITH A MAGNETIC BUTTON CLOSURE.

00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,248
LINE IT UP, LOCKS ITSELF SHUT.

THREE ROWS OF MOLLE
FOR TACTICAL GEAR,

00:26:21,451 --> 00:26:23,186
AND A COLLAPSIBLE
BEVERAGE HOLDER.

[ LAUGHS ]
WHEN YOU DON'T, IT FOLDS UP --

00:26:26,055 --> 00:26:27,223

AND OUT OF THE WAY.

00:26:29,459 --> 00:26:31,994
TO GET INTO IT, YOU DON'T NEED
TO TAKE IT OFF.

00:26:31,994 --> 00:26:33,429
JUST SPIN IT AROUND
AND OPEN IT UP.

00:26:33,429 --> 00:26:37,100
PLUS, YOU HAVE AUXILIARY POCKETS
FOR THINGS LIKE YOUR WALLET,

00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,367
LOOSE POCKET CHANGE, KEYS.

OVER ONE SHOULDER.

HANGS OVER YOUR LOWER BACK

00:27:12,135 --> 00:27:13,236
ARE YOU A DESIGNER?
UH, NO.

00:27:13,236 --> 00:27:15,204
I BUILT MY FIRST HOUSE
WHEN I WAS 19,

00:27:15,204 --> 00:27:18,141
AND I WAS IN FORT BENNING,
GEORGIA, WHEN I WAS 17.

00:27:18,141 --> 00:27:20,009
WERE YOU IN THE ARMY?
I WAS.

00:27:20,009 --> 00:27:23,045

WALKED IN, I LOOKED AT IT

ANOTHER KNAPSACK FOR GUYS.

THEY COST, RIGHT NOW,
$22.05 A PIECE.

REQUIRES AN EXPLANATION,

'CAUSE IT'S HARD
TO DIFFERENTIATE IT
AGAINST ANYTHING ELSE.

00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,029

YOU HAVE TO EDUCATE THE CONSUMER

00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:14,997
BECAUSE THIS IS
AN EMERGING MARKET.

IT'S A MURSE!
YOU KNOW WHAT --

00:28:24,106 --> 00:28:25,341

HERE'S THE CONCERN.
SURE. OKAY.

WITH MY FAMILY...
RIGHT.

00:28:28,377 --> 00:28:30,379
...I HAD A SIMILAR BAG,

00:28:30,379 --> 00:28:33,015
AND I WASN'T ASHAMED
TO WEAR IT IN PUBLIC

00:28:33,015 --> 00:28:34,217
BECAUSE EVERY OTHER GUY
IN EUROPE HAD ONE.

00:28:34,217 --> 00:28:37,220
EXACTLY.
WHEN I CAME BACK HERE,
I PUT THE SAME THING ON,

00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,422
I DIDN'T MAKE IT ONE BLOCK
DOWN THE STREET,

00:28:39,422 --> 00:28:42,158
EVERYBODY WAS LAUGHING AT ME.
YOU KNOW, IT --

00:28:42,158 --> 00:28:44,126
Greiner:
BUT THAT'S NOT A MURSE.

00:28:44,126 --> 00:28:45,394
ROBERT, I DON'T THINK THEY
WERE LAUGHING AT YOU FOR THAT.

00:28:45,394 --> 00:28:49,398
YOU KNOW, A COUPLE OF THINGS.
ONE, IT'S NOT A MURSE.

00:28:49,398 --> 00:28:52,168
WHEN YOU SEE THE GUYS
THAT I SELL TO,

00:28:52,168 --> 00:28:54,370
THE SECRET SERVICE AGENTS
AND MILITARY PERSONNEL

00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:55,438
AND LAW-ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL --

00:28:55,438 --> 00:28:57,240
I NEVER LAUGH AT SOMEBODY
WITH A GUN.

00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,408
RIGHT. EXACTLY.
WELL, LET'S GO
TO THE REAL NUMBERS.

00:28:59,408 --> 00:29:01,444
HOW MANY DID YOU SELL
LAST MONTH, ONLINE ONLY?

00:29:01,444 --> 00:29:03,246
PROBABLY LIKE 40.

00:29:05,081 --> 00:29:06,349
THAT'S --
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, IT'S NOT GOOD.

00:29:06,349 --> 00:29:08,184
BUT I STARTED THIS WITH $5,000.

00:29:08,184 --> 00:29:12,088
I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT
WITH NEXT TO NOTHING.

00:29:12,088 --> 00:29:14,423
WHY DO YOU THINK
THE COMPANY'S WORTH $700,000?

00:29:14,423 --> 00:29:17,360
OKAY, UM, $50,000 FOR
THE DESIGN PATENT, WHICH WE --

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,195
BUT WHAT DID YOU GET
THE DESIGN PATENT FOR?

00:29:19,195 --> 00:29:20,263
FOR THIS MODEL.

00:29:20,263 --> 00:29:21,464
LIKE, WHAT --
A BAG WITH A STRAP

00:29:21,464 --> 00:29:23,132
THAT HAS SO MANY POCKETS?
Greiner: JUST THE LOOK OF IT.

00:29:23,132 --> 00:29:24,166
IT'S JUST THE LOOK OF IT.

00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:25,434
WHAT ELSE ARE YOU ADDING
TO THE VALUE?

00:29:25,434 --> 00:29:27,470
A MULTIPLE OF SALES
FOR TWO YEARS

00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:30,206
BEING THE $145,000 PROJECTION.

00:29:30,206 --> 00:29:32,008
$18,000 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY,

00:29:32,008 --> 00:29:35,177
THAT BEING THE BANK OF YOUTUBE
COMMERCIALS THAT I'VE CREATED.

00:29:35,177 --> 00:29:36,979
THEY'RE REALLY FUNNY.
YOU SHOULD CHECK THEM OUT.
[ LAUGHS ]

00:29:36,979 --> 00:29:38,447
YOU'RE PUTTING A HARD VALUE
ON THOSE?

00:29:38,447 --> 00:29:40,316
VALUE IS A MATTER
OF PERCEPTION.

00:29:40,316 --> 00:29:42,451
YES, IT IS.
AND WE'RE ON --
IF WE'RE ON AN ISLAND

00:29:42,451 --> 00:29:45,388
AND YOU HAVE A BAR OF GOLD I
HAVE A CHEESEBURGER, WHO'S RICH?

00:29:45,388 --> 00:29:47,390
I'LL TAKE THE GOLD.
OKAY.

00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:49,125
I'M GONNA GET IN THE PLANE
AND LEAVE THE ISLAND.

John: LET'S GO -- ROBERT,
HOLD ON. ARE WE DONE?

00:29:51,327 --> 00:29:53,029
ARE WE DONE
WITH ALL THE NUMBERS?

00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:54,030
I WAS JUST --
N-NO.

00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,398
UM, OKAY,
AND $200,000 IN GOOD WILL.

00:29:55,398 --> 00:29:58,134
AND $200,000
IN GOOD WILL.

O'Leary:
IF I GAVE YOU $200,000,

00:30:03,005 --> 00:30:06,175
I'D HAVE TO OWN
ABOUT 260% OF THE COMPANY.

00:30:06,175 --> 00:30:07,310
ABOUT THAT.

00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:10,946
'CAUSE YOU HAVE
VERY SMALL SALES.

00:30:10,946 --> 00:30:12,181
THAT'S THE REASON I'M OUT.

00:30:12,181 --> 00:30:14,350
I'M JUST A DISCIPLINED
FINANCIAL INVESTOR.

00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:17,186
I UNDERSTAND.

00:30:17,186 --> 00:30:19,055
Cuban: I KIND OF AGREE
WITH KEVIN.

00:30:19,055 --> 00:30:21,324
I THINK THIS -- THIS IS
A HARD BUSINESS TO INVEST IN.

00:30:21,324 --> 00:30:24,327
I THINK YOU'RE A HUSTLER,
AND YOU'RE A GREAT SALESPERSON.

00:30:24,327 --> 00:30:26,128
I JUST THINK IT'S HARD
FOR YOU TO SCALE,

00:30:26,128 --> 00:30:27,296
WHICH MAKES IT HARD
TO INVEST IN.

00:30:27,296 --> 00:30:29,432
AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.

WITH, UM, GOOD SALES, BAD SALES,

ON THE PERSON.

FOR SERVING OUR COUNTRY.

IN OPERATING THIS BUSINESS.

AS IMPRESSED AS I AM WITH YOU,

00:31:10,272 --> 00:31:13,142

A MESSENGER BAG.

FOR YOU.

EX-MILITARY.

DO IT IN THE TIME FRAME

ABOUT WHAT MEN CARRY AROUND.

AND ON QVC
AND CREATING PRODUCTS,

00:31:43,406 --> 00:31:45,007
THE HARDEST THING IS

00:31:45,007 --> 00:31:47,076
WHEN THERE'S JUST A TON
OF COMPETITION

00:31:47,076 --> 00:31:51,180
AND YOU'RE NOT EVEN SURE HOW
POPULAR THE MARKET IS FOR IT.

00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:54,183

00:31:54,183 --> 00:31:57,086
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE
BUYING THE PRODUCT.

00:31:57,086 --> 00:31:59,188

I'M OUT.

John: GOOD LUCK.

WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS THAT
THEY DIDN'T LIKE MY VALUATION.

I'M SURE THEY WOULD HAVE LIKED

00:32:13,469 --> 00:32:16,172
TO HAVE 70% OF THE BUSINESS
FOR 20 GRAND.

00:32:16,172 --> 00:32:18,340

INTO THE FUTURE,

00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,010

WORTH A LOT MORE

00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:22,378

A LOT MORE.

SLASH OUR COSTS

FOR $5.

YOU CAN ADD A BOX FOR $5.

AND WE'RE PROJECTED
TO END AT $840,000.

00:35:20,255 --> 00:35:23,025
WE JUST STARTED JANUARY
OF LAST YEAR.

00:35:23,025 --> 00:35:25,294
THAT FIRST MONTH,
WE ONLY MADE $375,

00:35:25,294 --> 00:35:29,031
AND LAST MONTH WAS OUR BIGGEST
MONTH EVER AT $100,000.

00:35:29,031 --> 00:35:30,232
GOOD JOB, GUYS.
THAT'S AWESOME.

00:35:30,232 --> 00:35:32,134
ANSWER WHY IT'S CALLED
"BOTTLE BREACHER."

00:35:32,134 --> 00:35:33,402
Eli: YES, SIR.
I'D LOVE TO ANSWER.

00:35:33,402 --> 00:35:36,238
A BREACHER IS AN OPERATOR
WHOSE JOB IT IS TO GET US --

00:35:36,238 --> 00:35:38,974
THE ASSAULTERS INTO WHATEVER
TARGET WE'RE HITTING.

00:35:38,974 --> 00:35:40,175
Cuban:
GOES IN FIRST, RIGHT?
SO YOU GOT THAT BIG OLD DOOR --
YES, SIR.

00:35:40,175 --> 00:35:41,343
WHETHER IT'S A SLEDGEHAMMER,

00:35:41,343 --> 00:35:43,345
WHETHER IT'S A STRIP-CHARGE
EXPLOSIVE ON THE DOOR,

00:35:43,345 --> 00:35:44,380
HE IS THE BREACHER.

00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,148
THAT'S A QUALIFICATION
LIKE "SNIPER."

00:35:46,148 --> 00:35:48,217
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT TO BREACH
INTO THAT BEER SOMEHOW, RIGHT?

00:35:48,217 --> 00:35:49,985
YOU GOT TO GET IN THERE.
YOU GOT TO BREACH.

00:35:49,985 --> 00:35:51,220
BOTTLE BREACHER.
AND OUR CUSTOMER BASE,
WE FOUND, LOVES IT.

00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,389
Herjavec:
THAT'S A GREAT STORY.
THEY LOVE IT.

00:35:53,389 --> 00:35:55,357
Greiner: CAN THIS BE MADE
IN OTHER BULLETS?

00:35:55,357 --> 00:35:56,358
YEAH.
YES, MA'AM.

00:35:56,358 --> 00:35:58,093
THAT'S
A 20-MILLIMETER ROUND.

00:35:58,093 --> 00:35:59,428
THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD FIRE OUT
OF, LIKE, AN ATTACK HELICOPTER

00:35:59,428 --> 00:36:01,130
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
SO...

00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,131
SO THIS IS LIKE --

00:36:02,131 --> 00:36:03,332
Herjavec: OH!
OH, MY GOSH.

00:36:03,332 --> 00:36:05,034
Cuban: OH, YEAH.
THIS IS THE MOTHER
OF ALL BULLETS.

00:36:05,034 --> 00:36:06,368
John: OH, YEAH.
NOW YOU'RE TALKING.
COMPARE.

00:36:06,368 --> 00:36:08,003
WE ACTUALLY CALL THAT
THE WMD --

00:36:08,003 --> 00:36:09,104
THE WEAPON
OF MASS DESTRUCTION.

00:36:09,104 --> 00:36:11,140
YOU GET ANY RESISTANCE
BECAUSE IT'S A BULLET?

00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:14,109
BECAUSE SOME MERCHANDISERS
DON'T LIKE THE THOUGHT

00:36:14,109 --> 00:36:16,345
OF A BULLET BECAUSE
THERE'S BEEN, IN OUR SOCIETY...
NO.

00:36:16,345 --> 00:36:18,313
...PROBLEMS AND ISSUES
WITH BULLETS AND GUNS.

00:36:18,313 --> 00:36:20,049
NO.
YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

00:36:20,049 --> 00:36:23,252
AND, YOU KNOW,
TO THAT POINT, WE --

00:36:23,252 --> 00:36:25,421
WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY PROBLEMS
SO FAR, YOU KNOW,

00:36:25,421 --> 00:36:27,990
PUSHING THESE ALONG
THROUGH THE MARKET.

00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,358
AND WE FOUND THAT MOST PEOPLE,
YOU KNOW, THEY SEE IT

00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:31,160
AS A DISPLAY PIECE
AND NOTHING --

00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,062
NOTHING REALLY HARMFUL.
Jen: THAT'S WHERE THE STORE'S
COMING FROM.

00:36:33,062 --> 00:36:34,997
EVEN THOUGH I KNOW EXACTLY
WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM, LORI.

00:36:34,997 --> 00:36:37,032
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.
I MEAN, IT'S A REALITY.
ABSOLUTELY.

00:36:37,032 --> 00:36:38,434
WE HAVE NEVER HAD ANYONE
BE LIKE, "OH, I HATE THAT."

00:36:38,434 --> 00:36:40,069
WELL, LIKE,
THEN DON'T BUY IT.

00:36:40,069 --> 00:36:41,336
O'Leary: WHERE DO YOU NEED
TO EXPAND THE CAPACITY?

00:36:41,336 --> 00:36:43,972
LET'S SAY THIS IS A HUGE HIT
ON "SHARK TANK"

00:36:43,972 --> 00:36:46,008
AND YOU GET AN ORDER
FOR 50,000 UNITS.

00:36:46,008 --> 00:36:47,142
HOW ARE YOU GONNA DO IT?

00:36:47,142 --> 00:36:48,277
I KNOW AT THAT NUMBER,

00:36:48,277 --> 00:36:51,146
I'M GONNA HAVE TO LEASE
ANOTHER INCUBATOR SPACE.

00:36:51,146 --> 00:36:52,281
I'M ALSO GONNA
HAVE TO GET --

00:36:52,281 --> 00:36:54,049
IS THAT WHAT YOU NEED
THE $150,000 FOR?

00:36:54,049 --> 00:36:55,284
YES, SIR. THAT --
PART OF IT.

00:36:55,284 --> 00:36:57,286
AS WE GROW, WE COULD DOUBLE
IN SIZE RIGHT NOW

00:36:57,286 --> 00:36:58,420
IN THE SPACE
THAT WE'RE IN.

00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,055
BUT IF IT STARTS
GOING BIGGER THAN THAT --

00:37:00,055 --> 00:37:02,157
INSIDE THAT SPACE,
WHAT DO YOU NEED TO BUY?

00:37:02,157 --> 00:37:03,425
OKAY, SO, WE NEED
MORE ENGRAVERS.

00:37:03,425 --> 00:37:06,328
EVERY -- YOU KNOW, 90%
OF OUR ORDERS ARE CUSTOMIZED.

00:37:06,328 --> 00:37:09,164
WHAT STOPS ANYBODY ELSE
FROM DOING THIS?

00:37:09,164 --> 00:37:11,066
OKAY, THAT'S --
AND THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.

00:37:11,066 --> 00:37:12,334
AND WE DO HAVE
COMPETITION.

00:37:12,334 --> 00:37:14,303
THANKS
TO MR. WONDERFUL HERE,

00:37:14,303 --> 00:37:16,371
WE WERE ACTUALLY WATCHING
AN EPISODE OF "SHARK TANK,"

00:37:16,371 --> 00:37:18,073
AND MR. WONDERFUL
WAS RIPPING APART

00:37:18,073 --> 00:37:19,441
AN ENTREPRENEUR
BECAUSE HE --
HE NEVER DOES THAT.

00:37:19,441 --> 00:37:22,311
Greiner: TYPICAL DAY.
...HE DID NOT BRAND
ON HIS PRODUCT,

00:37:22,311 --> 00:37:24,046
AND AS SOON
AS IT LEFT THE PACKAGE,

00:37:24,046 --> 00:37:25,414
YOU COULDN'T TELL IT
FROM THE OTHER ONES.

00:37:25,414 --> 00:37:27,049
AFTER THE EPISODE,
I LOOKED AT JEN,

00:37:27,049 --> 00:37:28,217
AND I WAS LIKE, "HEY, BABE.

00:37:28,217 --> 00:37:29,384
"WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO STAMP 'BOTTLE BREACHER'

00:37:29,384 --> 00:37:30,452
ON EVERY SINGLE
ONE OF THESE."

00:37:30,452 --> 00:37:32,221
SO WE DID.
HE STAYED UP SO LATE.

00:37:32,221 --> 00:37:34,089
O'Leary: WELL, I THINK THE NAME
HAS A LOT TO DO WITH SUCCESS.

00:37:34,089 --> 00:37:35,290
IT'S CATCHY -- LIKE,
BREACHING AND OPENING.

00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:36,425
Herjavec: YEAH,
IT'S A VERY GOOD NAME.

00:37:36,425 --> 00:37:38,260
Eli: THANK YOU, SIR.
I MEAN, THAT'S HALF THE BATTLE.

00:37:39,261 --> 00:37:41,130
Cuban: GIVE US
THE NAVY S.E.A.L. STORY.

00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:44,066
YOU KNOW, I'M SO, SO HONORED
AND HUMBLED TO BE ABLE

00:37:44,066 --> 00:37:46,201
TO SERVE WITH THE GUYS
THAT I GOT TO SERVE WITH

00:37:46,201 --> 00:37:47,336
THE LAST EIGHT, NINE YEARS.

00:37:47,336 --> 00:37:50,072
I DID THREE COMBAT DEPLOYMENTS
TO IRAQ.

00:37:50,072 --> 00:37:51,273
THE FIRST TIME I WENT
TO S.E.A.L. TRAINING,

00:37:51,273 --> 00:37:53,142
I DIDN'T MAKE IT THROUGH.
I ACTUALLY MADE IT

00:37:53,142 --> 00:37:55,077
THROUGH THE HARDEST PORTION
OF S.E.A.L. TRAINING,

00:37:55,077 --> 00:37:56,945
WHICH IS CALLED HELL WEEK,
AND THAT'S 5√ DAYS

00:37:56,945 --> 00:37:58,380
OF JUST GETTING YOUR BUTT KICKED
THE WHOLE TIME.

00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:02,217
NO SLEEP WHATSOEVER, YOU'RE
COLD, WET, AND YOU'RE SANDY,

00:38:02,217 --> 00:38:04,119
AND YOU'RE JUST GETTING
BEAT DOWN THE WHOLE TIME.

00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:05,320
I MADE IT
THROUGH THAT WEEK.

00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,122
ABOUT A WEEK
AND A HALF LATER,

00:38:07,122 --> 00:38:09,158
THE INSTRUCTORS PULLED ME
INTO THEIR OFFICE,

00:38:09,158 --> 00:38:11,260
AND THEY SAID, "YOUNG MAN,
Y-YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE HEART,

00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,095
"BUT YOU'RE NOT
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

00:38:13,095 --> 00:38:14,296
"AND WE NEED THE BEST
OF THE BEST HERE,

00:38:14,296 --> 00:38:16,031
SO WE'RE GONNA SEND YOU OUT
TO THE FLEET."

00:38:16,031 --> 00:38:17,332
I WAS ON A SHIP
FOR 2√ YEARS.

00:38:17,332 --> 00:38:19,334
IT WASN'T VERY FUN AT ALL.
Herjavec: WOW.

00:38:19,334 --> 00:38:22,237
BUT I-I -- YOU KNOW,
I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO.

00:38:22,237 --> 00:38:23,305
I PAID ATTENTION.

00:38:23,305 --> 00:38:25,073
YOU KNOW,
AND 2√ YEARS LATER,

00:38:25,073 --> 00:38:27,009
I CAME BACK,
AND I MADE IT THROUGH.

00:38:27,009 --> 00:38:28,410
AND I-I WANTED
TO TELL YOU GUYS THAT

00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:30,145
BECAUSE THAT'S WHO JENNIFER
AND I ARE.

00:38:30,145 --> 00:38:31,313
WE DON'T GIVE UP.

00:38:31,313 --> 00:38:34,283
YOU KNOW, LIFE IS FULL
OF OBSTACLES AND FAILURES,

00:38:34,283 --> 00:38:36,385
AND WHEN WE FACE THAT,
WE DON'T RUN FOR THE HILLS.

00:38:36,385 --> 00:38:38,453
WE JUST KEEP CHARGING ON,
AND WE FIGURE IT OUT.

00:38:40,255 --> 00:38:42,424
SO, DO YOU DO ANY WEDDING SHOWS
OR ANYTHING?

00:38:42,424 --> 00:38:45,394
WE HAVEN'T YET.

00:38:45,394 --> 00:38:48,096
JUST BECAUSE, HONESTLY,
WHEN HE WAS ACTIVE DUTY,

00:38:48,096 --> 00:38:50,032
I WAS AT HOME,
RUNNING THE BUSINESS.

00:38:50,032 --> 00:38:52,034
WE WANTED TO WAIT TO EXPAND
TILL HE GOT OUT,

00:38:52,034 --> 00:38:53,168
WHICH IS NEXT MONTH.

00:38:53,168 --> 00:38:56,104
I JUST QUIT GOING IN
TO MY NAVY JOB TWO MONTHS AGO.

00:38:56,104 --> 00:38:57,139
IT'S TWO-FOLD.

00:38:57,139 --> 00:38:59,041
WHEN HE WAS DEPLOYED,
I HAD A REALLY TOUGH TIME,

00:38:59,041 --> 00:39:01,310
AND THAT'S WHY I STARTED WORKING
ONLINE BY MYSELF AT NIGHT,

00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:03,345
BECAUSE I WAS -- I WAS LONELY,
AND I WAS BY MYSELF.

00:39:03,345 --> 00:39:05,147
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE
IN SAN DIEGO.

00:39:05,147 --> 00:39:07,182
AND I GOT USED TO IT,

00:39:07,182 --> 00:39:09,351
AND IT'S BEEN
A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE.

00:39:09,351 --> 00:39:11,286
AFTER THREE DEPLOYMENTS,
IT'S NOW TIME FOR HIM
TO COME HOME.

00:39:11,286 --> 00:39:13,155
WE HAVE TWO GIRLS.
THEY ASK ABOUT DADDY.

00:39:13,155 --> 00:39:15,190
AND, UM --
AWW.

00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:17,025
NO, THEY DO.
AND THEY -- AND THEY MISS HIM.

00:39:17,025 --> 00:39:20,162
ALL RIGHT, GUYS, LOOK.

00:39:20,162 --> 00:39:21,263
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.

00:39:31,273 --> 00:39:33,075
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.

00:39:33,075 --> 00:39:35,077
I LIKE THE STORY.
IT'S VERY SIMPLE.

00:39:35,077 --> 00:39:38,146
I'VE MADE MONEY WITH MILITARY
GUYS 'CAUSE THEY'RE FOCUSED.

00:39:38,146 --> 00:39:40,082
I'LL DO IT FOR 20%.

00:39:41,216 --> 00:39:42,217
STRAIGHT EQUITY.

00:39:42,217 --> 00:39:43,952
WOW.
THAT'S -- THAT --

00:39:43,952 --> 00:39:46,255
I'M HONORED TO GET
THAT OFFER FROM YOU, SIR.

00:39:46,255 --> 00:39:47,322
[ LAUGHS ]
NO, NO, NO.

00:39:47,322 --> 00:39:49,258
I REALLY AM.
YOU KNOW WHY?

00:39:49,258 --> 00:39:51,093
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D GET AN OFFER
LIKE THAT FROM YOU.

00:39:51,093 --> 00:39:52,461
NO, NO, NO, LISTEN.
I LIKE YOUR STORY.
THAT -- THAT'S AWESOME.

00:39:52,461 --> 00:39:54,029
I LIKE -- LISTEN,
I STRUCTURE MY DEALS

00:39:54,029 --> 00:39:55,063
BASED ON THE RISK I'M TAKING,

00:39:55,063 --> 00:39:57,332
AND I THINK THIS BUSINESS
CAN BE GROWN.

00:39:57,332 --> 00:40:00,235
I REALLY DO APPRECIATE
THAT OFFER, AND I'D LIKE --

00:40:00,235 --> 00:40:02,004
OUT OF RESPECT
FOR THE OTHER SHARKS,

00:40:02,004 --> 00:40:03,205
I'D LIKE TO HEAR IF THERE ARE
ANY OTHER OFFERS BEFORE WE --

00:40:03,205 --> 00:40:04,306
WELL, LET'S HEAR
IF THEY'RE INTERESTED.

00:40:04,306 --> 00:40:06,174
Greiner: YOU ARE WONDERFUL.

00:40:06,174 --> 00:40:08,076
Cuban: YOU'RE GOOD.
OUT OF RESPECT TO US,
YOU WANT TO HEAR OUR OFFERS.

00:40:08,076 --> 00:40:09,244
YES, MA'AM.
YES, MA'AM.

00:40:09,244 --> 00:40:11,146
I-I WANT TO HEAR IF THERE'S
ANY OTHER OFFERS OUT THERE.

00:40:11,146 --> 00:40:12,281
WELL, RESPECT TO HIM
AS WELL.

00:40:12,281 --> 00:40:14,082
WELL, LISTEN.
I LIKE YOU.

00:40:14,082 --> 00:40:15,384
YOU HAVE A NICHE MARKET.

00:40:15,384 --> 00:40:20,122
BUT I PERSONALLY -- I LIKE
BIG MARKETS, AND SO I'M OUT.

00:40:22,391 --> 00:40:25,093
ALL RIGHT,
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU AN OFFER.

00:40:29,231 --> 00:40:35,137
I WANT TO GIVE YOU
$200,000 FOR 25%.

00:40:35,137 --> 00:40:40,008
BUT IT WOULD BE CONTINGENT
THAT I CAN GET THE LICENSES.

00:40:40,008 --> 00:40:42,311
I WAS ALREADY THINKING
KEY RINGS AND PAPERWEIGHTS

00:40:42,311 --> 00:40:44,012
AND A LOT OF OTHER THINGS,

00:40:44,012 --> 00:40:45,080
AND I DON'T THINK

00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,348
THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO RAMP UP
THAT QUICK,

00:40:46,348 --> 00:40:48,984
AND I DON'T WANT THE KNOCK-OFFS
OUT THERE IN THE WORLD

00:40:48,984 --> 00:40:50,385
TO KNOCK YOU OFF
AND GO DO IT THEMSELVES.

00:40:50,385 --> 00:40:53,422
Herjavec: ELI, THANK YOU
FOR YOUR SERVICE.
THANK YOU, ROBERT.

00:40:53,422 --> 00:40:57,125
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IT TAKES
LIKE A S.E.A.L. DOES.

00:40:57,125 --> 00:41:04,132
$150,000 FOR 20% FROM KEVIN,
$200,000 FOR 25% FROM DAYMOND.

00:41:04,132 --> 00:41:06,335
I'M GONNA CLEAR THE FIELD
SO YOU CAN CONSIDER THOSE.

00:41:06,335 --> 00:41:07,469
I'M OUT.

00:41:13,976 --> 00:41:16,111
MARK, WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED
IN GOING IN

00:41:16,111 --> 00:41:18,046
WITH EITHER
OF THE OTHER SHARKS?

00:41:21,049 --> 00:41:24,019
I'D BE INTERESTING
IN GOING IN WITH KEVIN.
OKAY.

00:41:24,019 --> 00:41:25,988
SO, MARK, DO YOU JUST WANT
TO SPLIT IT $75,000 EACH?

00:41:25,988 --> 00:41:27,122
YEAH, WE'LL JUST -- YEAH,
YEAH, WE'LL JUST SPLIT IT.
10 POINTS EACH?

00:41:27,122 --> 00:41:28,156
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

00:41:28,156 --> 00:41:29,391
SO, IF -- LET US SPLIT IT.

00:41:29,391 --> 00:41:31,026
THAT'LL WORK.

00:41:31,026 --> 00:41:33,128
O'Leary:
SO IT'S $150,000 FOR 20%.

00:41:33,128 --> 00:41:34,997
MARK AND I EACH GET 10%.

00:41:34,997 --> 00:41:37,065
YES, SIR.
