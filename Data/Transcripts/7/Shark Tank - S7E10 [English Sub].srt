FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.

00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:39,099
TYLER, YOU ARE A GREAT EXAMPLE
OF AN ENTREPRENEUR.

00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:42,235
ONE OF THE THINGS I FIND
VERY ADMIRABLE

00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,538
IS THAT YOU WANTED TO MAKE SURE
THAT EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT.

00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:48,441
ON THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT,
THOUGH, YOU'RE ONE PERSON.

00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,644
YOU CAN'T GO
AND STAND IN THE FACTORY

00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:52,178
AND WATCH 40 MADE AT A TIME.

00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,614
I PERSONALLY SEE IT
AS A LICENSING DEAL,

00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:57,384
BECAUSE I DO THINK,
TO SCALE, YOU'RE GONNA NEED

00:06:57,384 --> 00:07:00,387
A BIG COMPANY
THAT CAN DO EXACTLY THAT.
RIGHT.

00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:03,156
I THINK THAT'S
A BIT OF A WAYS AWAY.

00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,492
AND FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.

00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:07,627
THANK YOU, LORI.

00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:12,065
TYLER, INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVE
FOR ANYBODY AT ANY AGE.

00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:15,302
AT YOUR AGE, DOUBLY IMPRESSIVE
WHERE YOU'VE GOTTEN.

00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:16,569
NO ONE DOUBTS YOU.

00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,972
I DOUBT WHAT THE MARKET IS.

00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:21,975
IF IT'S A TRICYCLE,
YOU'VE GOT TO CHANGE THE DESIGN.

00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:25,345
IT'S TOO HARD-CORE FOR GENERAL
DISTRIBUTION FOR KIDS TO USE.

00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:28,481
IF IT'S NICHE,
FOR HARD-CORE PEOPLE LIKE ME

00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:31,885
THAT LOVE SPEED, OR OLDER KIDS,
IT'S TOO CHEAP.

00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,787
I DON'T KNOW HOW BIG
THAT MARKET IS.

00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,156
BUT I THINK THERE'S
LOADS OF TOYS IN THIS SPACE

00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:38,692
THAT ARE THE KID-FRIENDLY,
RIDE-IT-IN-YOUR-DRIVEWAY

KIND OF THING,
AND I THINK IT FITS THERE.

00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,796
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
A BRILLIANT GUY.

00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,864
YOU'RE GONNA INVENT
SOMETHING ELSE.

FITS OR HOW I CAN HELP YOU.

YOUR NEXT PRODUCT, TYLER?

00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,276
MY NEXT PRODUCT?

00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:58,945
THE REASON I ASKED
ABOUT WHAT'S NEXT...
MM-HMM.

00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,414
...IS THIS --
I DON'T SEE THIS AS, YOU KNOW,

DEFINITELY.
RIGHT?

00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,453
SO IF I'M INVESTING
IN YOUR COMPANY,

00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:08,188
THERE'S GOT TO BE
SOMETHING NEXT,

00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:10,090
BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE
THE INVESTMENT

00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,125
SO WE CAN GET
SOMEPLACE ELSE TOGETHER --

00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,727
SOMEPLACE BIGGER AND BETTER.

00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:16,229
SO, I THINK THERE'S LOTS
OF STUFF THAT YOU CAN DO WITH,

00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,865
YOU KNOW, ADD-ONS, ALL THAT
CUSTOMIZATION KINDS OF THINGS.

00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:21,434
THOSE WILL INCREASE YOUR
BUSINESS ON THE MARGIN.

00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:24,170
THAT'S NOT GONNA TAKE YOU
TO A $25 MILLION COMPANY.

00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,240
I MEAN, THE SCOOTER SELLS
SEVEN MILLION UNITS IN ONE YEAR.

00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,009
ONE YEAR.
BUT THAT APPLIES
TO EVERYBODY.

00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,244
AND IT GETS YOU FROM POINT "A"
TO POINT "B", AND IT'S FUN.

00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,779
TYLER, LOOK,
I THINK IT'S BRILLIANT.

00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:35,648
BUT I-I HAVE TO SEE
A VISION FROM YOU, RIGHT,

00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:38,084
THAT TAKES IT SO IT CAN BE
A MUCH BIGGER COMPANY.

00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,186
BUT, FOR RIGHT NOW,
I DON'T SEE IT, TYLER.

00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,622

I'M OUT.

00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,463

BECAUSE YOU'RE PUTTING

00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:51,711
OF OVER $4 MILLION.

00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,446

LET'S HEAR ABOUT
THOSE SALES.

00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:56,950
LAST YEAR, WE OPENED
GLOW RECIPE IN NOVEMBER.

00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:00,053
FOR THE FIRST TWO MONTHS,
OUR REVENUE WAS $3,000.

00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:03,823
2015, YEAR-TO-DATE,
WE'RE AT $550,000.

00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:04,824

00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,426
AND WE'RE PROJECTED TO DO
$1 MILLION

BY THE END OF THIS YEAR.

00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,262
SO, SARAH,
ALL THOSE SALES ARE ONLINE.

00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:11,497
SO, HALF OF THAT COMES FROM
OUR E-COMMERCE SITE,

00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:12,799
WHERE WE CURATE THE PRODUCTS.

00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:15,001
THE SECOND IS WHERE
WE ACT AS A BRAND INCUBATOR.

00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:17,570
SO, OUR SITE --
AND YOU CHARGE THEM
FOR THAT SERVICE?

00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,607
YES. WE SHARE THE REVENUE
WITH THE BRANDS.

00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,648
IS TO NOT ONLY CURATE,

WE HAVE 110 SKEWS.

WELL, UNTIL
THE NEXT ONE COMES, RIGHT?

00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,905
IF KOREA HAS SO MUCH INNOVATION,
WHY WOULDN'T LARGE RETAILERS

00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,841
THAT MAKE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

QUESTIONS ABOUT NUMBERS

00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:17,369
BEFORE I --
I DECIDE IF I'M GONNA INVEST...
ABSOLUTELY.

00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,138
...BECAUSE THIS IS NOT
THE CHARITY TANK TO ME.

00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:20,038
NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.

00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,173
I'M NOT IN IT
FOR THE CHARITY.

00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:22,708
YOU SOMETIMES -- IT'S NOT ALWAYS
ABOUT THE MONEY.

00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:23,842

PICK YOUR OWN CHARITIES.

00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:25,811
LISTEN, I'M SORRY. I DO.
I GIVE A LOT TO CHARITY.

00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:26,845
IT IS ABOUT THE MONEY.

00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:28,180
BUT THIS IS
AN INVESTMENT FOR ME.

THEY CAN MAKE ABOUT
4,000 BAGS A YEAR.

TO ABOUT $900,000.
