THE VALUATION IS ON AVERAGE,

WE HAVE 500 MATS PER YEAR
PER BOUTIQUE.

$10 MILLION IN SALES NEXT YEAR.

I AM HUMBLED, BUT I --

00:38:26,916 --> 00:38:29,626
BUT YOU TOLD ME
YOU'RE VERY OPTIMISTIC.

00:38:29,626 --> 00:38:30,716
SO I GOT TO BUY INTO IT,
RIGHT?

00:38:30,716 --> 00:38:33,676
I MEAN, IF YOU COULD
GO AND SEE THE RESPONSE.

00:38:33,676 --> 00:38:35,626
I MEAN, WE WERE AT
THE WORLD'S LARGEST --
YEAH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

LINDSEY, LINDSEY,
DON'T GO THERE. DON'T GO THERE.

00:38:37,686 --> 00:38:38,836
LINDSEY, YOU'RE TALKING
IN CIRCLES NOW.

00:38:38,836 --> 00:38:40,766
O'Leary:
MARK, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:38:40,766 --> 00:38:42,826
I'M NOT GONNA DO A DEAL
WITH YOU NO MATTER WHAT

00:38:42,826 --> 00:38:45,876
BECAUSE I WOULD GO NUTS.

00:38:49,676 --> 00:38:53,726
Corcoran: WHAT DISTURBS ME IS
YOU ARE GIVING US A PRICE TODAY

00:38:53,726 --> 00:38:56,796
ON WHAT THE BUSINESS WILL BE
WORTH FOUR OR FIVE YEARS OUT.

00:38:56,796 --> 00:38:59,716
BUT I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $1 MILLION.

00:39:00,716 --> 00:39:04,314
BUT I WANT TO PAY IT OVER
FOUR YEARS -- $250,000 A YEAR.

00:39:04,314 --> 00:39:04,846
OKAY.

00:39:04,846 --> 00:39:05,886
THE RESTRICTIONS ON THAT --

00:39:05,886 --> 00:39:07,656
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THE 5%?

00:39:07,656 --> 00:39:08,796
YES, I AM HAPPY WITH THE 5%

00:39:08,796 --> 00:39:10,746
BECAUSE I TOTALLY
BELIEVE IN HER.

00:39:10,746 --> 00:39:12,766
I THINK YOU HAVE GOT
A RUNAWAY PRODUCT,

00:39:12,766 --> 00:39:14,756
BUT I THINK
YOU'RE YOUR OWN WORST ENEMY

00:39:14,756 --> 00:39:15,836
BECAUSE OF YOUR OPTIMISM.

00:39:15,836 --> 00:39:17,856
I THINK YOU NEED
A HEAVYWEIGHT,

00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,836
SEASONED PERSON
WHO HAS BUILT BUSINESSES.

00:39:20,836 --> 00:39:21,916
YEAH.

00:39:21,916 --> 00:39:23,886
THE LAST THING I'M GONNA DO
IS THROW $1 MILLION AT YOU.

00:39:23,886 --> 00:39:26,886
I THINK WHAT I HAVE TO WORK INTO
THE DEAL ARE TWO CONTINGENCIES.

00:39:26,886 --> 00:39:29,686
I THINK, ONE, I HAVE TO KNOW
THAT YOU GET THE PATENT.

00:39:29,686 --> 00:39:31,696
YEAH.
SECONDLY,
I THINK WE HAVE TO ESTABLISH

00:39:31,696 --> 00:39:34,686
THE BENCHMARKS
YOU CITED OVER --

00:39:34,686 --> 00:39:36,866
I'M HAPPY TO PAY OUT
THE MONEY OVER FOUR YEARS --

00:39:36,866 --> 00:39:38,906
OVER FOUR YEARS,
YOU HIT THOSE TARGETS.

00:39:38,906 --> 00:39:41,706
AND SO I -- I --
I APPRECIATE THAT OFFER.

00:39:41,706 --> 00:39:42,866
AND I'D LOVE TO ASK
YOU GUYS --

00:39:42,866 --> 00:39:44,776
SO, MR. WONDERFUL,
WHAT IS YOUR VISION,

00:39:44,776 --> 00:39:45,896
IF YOU'RE GONNA BE INVOLVED
IN THE COMPANY?

00:39:45,896 --> 00:39:48,666
WHAT DO YOU SEE THAT YOU WOULD
DO FOR THE PRODUCT?

00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:51,626
MY CONCERNS ARE THIS -- I'M
GONNA HELP YOU WITH THE LEGALS,

00:39:51,626 --> 00:39:53,896
ASSUMING THIS PATENT
ACTUALLY GETS ISSUED

00:39:53,896 --> 00:39:55,866
BECAUSE THIS IS GONNA
GET KNOCKED OFF,

00:39:55,866 --> 00:39:57,676
AND I WILL PROTECT IT.

00:39:57,676 --> 00:39:59,896
NUMBER TWO,
I WILL MAKE THIS FAMOUS ONLINE.

00:39:59,896 --> 00:40:01,636
THERE'S NO QUESTION
ABOUT THAT.

00:40:01,636 --> 00:40:03,756
I DON'T THINK YOU'VE
REALLY MAXIMIZED THAT.

00:40:03,756 --> 00:40:06,816
SO MY FOCUS IN THE SHORT TERM
WOULD BE TO ACTUALLY WORK HARD,

00:40:06,816 --> 00:40:08,646
THAT YOU DID HIT
THE $10 MILLION,

00:40:08,646 --> 00:40:10,646

YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?

00:40:10,646 --> 00:40:11,786
YEAH.
I'D RATHER YOU MADE IT

WHAT YOU WERE ASKING FOR.

HE GAVE YOU THE $1 MILLION

THE WORDS THAT CAME OUT
OF YOUR MOUTH.

TO MAKE IT WASN'T MY OPTIMISM,
WHICH I HAD IN SPADES,

BUT IT WAS THE SELF DOUBT
AND THE INSECURITY THAT I FELT

THAT MADE ME PAUSE AND THINK,
