IN THE TANK, ENTREPRENEURS
SEEK AN INVESTMENT

00:00:11,453 --> 00:00:14,443
TO START, GROW, OR SAVE
THEIR BUSINESSES.

00:00:14,443 --> 00:00:17,393
GETTING INTO COLLEGE
IS A BIG DEAL.

HOW TO PAY FOR IT...
IS AN ORDEAL.

00:00:19,383 --> 00:00:20,533

IF THE SHARKS HEAR A GREAT IDEA,

00:00:22,533 --> 00:00:25,383
THEY'LL INVEST
THEIR OWN MONEY...

00:00:25,383 --> 00:00:26,453
HAVE YOU SOLD ANY YET?

00:00:26,453 --> 00:00:28,403
WE HAVE NOT SOLD ANY.

00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:29,433
...AND FIGHT EACH OTHER
FOR A DEAL.

00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:30,493
I LOVE THE IDEA.

00:00:30,493 --> 00:00:32,433
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MARK?
YES OR NO?

00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:34,443
BUT THE ENTREPRENEURS MUST GET

00:00:34,443 --> 00:00:36,423
THE FULL AMOUNT
THEY'RE ASKING FOR

00:00:36,423 --> 00:00:38,403

CONFUSING,

RIGHT?

00:00:43,473 --> 00:00:45,503
EVERYBODY HAS A PLAN UNTIL
THEY GET PUNCHED IN THE FACE.

00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:49,473
the PROBLEM FOR ME IS YOU'RE
ASKING FOR $700,000 FOR 5%.

00:00:49,473 --> 00:00:51,443
BEFORE YOU GO OUT,
COULD YOU MAKE US AN OFFER?

00:00:51,443 --> 00:00:53,393

THAT YOU GUYS GOT

WHAT IS IT
ABOUT A PARKING TICKET

00:02:43,423 --> 00:02:45,503
THAT GENERATES SUCH ANGER IN US?

00:02:45,503 --> 00:02:47,593
IT'S THE INJUSTICE
OF THE SITUATION.

00:02:47,593 --> 00:02:52,433
YOU KNOW THAT THEY MAKE THESE
SIGNS CONFUSING ON PURPOSE.

BY THE METER

FIXED IS THE APP
THAT FIGHTS BACK.

00:03:08,493 --> 00:03:09,593
SO, HOW DOES IT WORK?

00:03:09,593 --> 00:03:13,493
STEP ONE -- TAKE A PHOTOGRAPH
OF YOUR PARKING TICKET.

00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:16,433
STEP TWO -- THAT'S IT.

00:03:16,433 --> 00:03:19,423
THERE IS NO STEP TWO.
IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

00:03:19,423 --> 00:03:21,423
WE TAKE THAT PARKING TICKET,

00:03:21,423 --> 00:03:23,523
WE RUN IT THROUGH
OUR PROPRIETARY ALGORITHM

00:03:23,523 --> 00:03:26,493
TO LOOK FOR ISSUES AND ERRORS
THAT MAKE THAT TICKET INVALID.

00:03:26,493 --> 00:03:27,553
WHEN WE FIND AN ISSUE,

00:03:27,553 --> 00:03:31,353
WE ASSEMBLE A CONTEST LETTER
ON YOUR BEHALF

00:03:31,353 --> 00:03:32,443
AND SEND IT TO THE CITY.

00:03:32,443 --> 00:03:34,433
FOUR WEEKS LATER, YOU FIND OUT

00:03:34,433 --> 00:03:36,403
THAT YOUR TICKET
HAS BEEN DEALT WITH.

00:03:36,403 --> 00:03:37,473
WE NEED YOUR HELP

00:03:37,473 --> 00:03:41,413
TO EXPAND TO AS MANY CITIES
AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN

00:03:41,413 --> 00:03:45,423
BECAUSE EVERY CITY NEEDS
A TICKET HERO.

00:03:45,423 --> 00:03:46,573
-OH. [ LAUGHS ]
-[ LAUGHS ]

00:03:46,573 --> 00:03:49,493
SO, TELL US
THE BUSINESS MODEL.

00:03:49,493 --> 00:03:52,493
IT'S A FREE APP DOWNLOAD.
YOU SUBMIT YOUR TICKET.

00:03:52,493 --> 00:03:56,403
IF WE BEAT YOUR TICKET,
WE CHARGE A 35% SUCCESS FEE.

00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,433
WHAT'S THE SUCCESS RATE?

00:03:58,433 --> 00:04:00,533
WE WIN ABOUT 20% TO 30%
OF OUR CONTESTS.

00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:03,443
SO, HOW MANY PEOPLE
JUST DO IT THEMSELVES?

00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:04,463
SO, IN SAN FRANCISCO,

00:04:04,463 --> 00:04:07,373
ONLY 5% OF PARKING TICKETS
ARE CONTESTED,

00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:08,533
AND THOSE THAT ARE CONTESTED,

00:04:08,533 --> 00:04:11,483
I THINK THE WIN RATE
IS ABOUT 20%.

00:04:11,483 --> 00:04:14,503
WHAT IS THE TYPICAL REASON
THAT A TICKET WOULD BE --

00:04:14,503 --> 00:04:15,513
DISMISSED?
DISMISSED, YEAH.

00:04:15,513 --> 00:04:17,473
THERE'S LOTS
OF DIFFERENT REASONS.

00:04:17,473 --> 00:04:19,423
SO, INITIALLY,
WE LOOK FOR ERRORS.

00:04:19,423 --> 00:04:20,443
SO, THE STATUTORY INFORMATION

00:04:20,443 --> 00:04:21,503
THAT THE OFFICER
HAS TO WRITE DOWN.

00:04:21,503 --> 00:04:22,523
FREQUENTLY, THEY'RE IN A RUSH,

00:04:22,523 --> 00:04:24,433
THEY DON'T WRITE
THAT INFORMATION,

00:04:24,433 --> 00:04:26,433
THEY MADE A TYPO
ON THE LICENSE PLATE,

00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,563
THEY WROTE ACURA
WHEN IT'S AN AUDI.

00:04:27,563 --> 00:04:30,563
WE LOOK FOR ALL THESE ISSUES
THAT MAKE THE TICKET INVALID.

00:04:30,563 --> 00:04:33,493
OKAY, BUT YOU'RE NOT REALLY
SELLING A HIGHER SUCCESS RATE.

00:04:33,493 --> 00:04:35,483
YOU'RE REALLY SELLING THE FACT
THAT YOU'RE CONTESTING.

00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,553
'CAUSE ONLY 5% OF PEOPLE
ACTUALLY CONTEST.

00:04:37,553 --> 00:04:40,403
WE'RE ACTUALLY SELLING BOTH.
SO, FIRSTLY IT'S TIME CONSUMING.

00:04:40,403 --> 00:04:41,583
ADDITIONALLY,
MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW

00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:45,493
THAT THEIR TICKET IS INVALID
FOR, LIKE, X, Y, AND Z,

00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:46,533
SO WE'RE BASICALLY WINNING

00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:48,533
THOSE TICKETS THEY WOULD NEVER
HAVE CONTESTED.

00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:51,453
BUT DAVID, HOW MANY TICKETS
ARE ISSUED PER YEAR IN AMERICA?

00:04:51,453 --> 00:04:53,503
WE ESTIMATE 100 MILLION TICKETS
WRITTEN A YEAR.

00:04:53,503 --> 00:04:56,443
SO, THIS IS A MAJOR SOURCE
OF INCOME FOR THE POLICE.

00:04:56,443 --> 00:04:57,483
OH, A HUGE SOURCE.

00:04:57,483 --> 00:04:59,523
WHAT'S THE AVERAGE PENALTY,
OR TICKET?

00:04:59,523 --> 00:05:02,463
IN SAN FRANCISCO,
THE AVERAGE TICKET IS ABOUT $70.

00:05:02,463 --> 00:05:04,433
ARE YOU OPERATING
ANYWHERE ELSE RIGHT NOW?

00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:06,433

00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:12,393
YOU HAVE A $14 MILLION VALUE
ON THE BUSINESS.

00:05:12,393 --> 00:05:13,423

IT MUST BE HUGE.

00:05:13,423 --> 00:05:14,493
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?

00:05:14,493 --> 00:05:17,503

00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:24,503
WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO CONTEST A TICKET?

00:05:24,503 --> 00:05:26,523
BETWEEN THE CROWD WORKERS,
THE SOFTWARE,

00:05:26,523 --> 00:05:29,403
PEOPLE YOU'VE GOT WORKING AT
YOUR PLACE, WHAT DOES IT COST?

00:05:29,403 --> 00:05:30,483
FROM AN AVERAGE TICKET,

00:05:30,483 --> 00:05:33,423
WE MAKE ABOUT 5 TO 6 BUCKS
IN REVENUE.

00:05:33,423 --> 00:05:37,363
YOU ONLY MAKE $5 OR $6
PER SUCCESS?

00:05:37,363 --> 00:05:38,413
THAT'S A COMBINATION

00:05:38,413 --> 00:05:40,533
OF OUR 35% WIN RATE
WHEN WE BEAT THE TICKET,

00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:43,533
AND IF WE HAVE TO PAY
THE TICKET FOR YOU,

00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:46,493
WE CHARGE YOU
A $1.95 CONVENIENCE FEE.

00:05:46,493 --> 00:05:49,453
WHAT'S IT COST TO ACQUIRE
THE INCREMENTAL CUSTOMER?

00:05:49,453 --> 00:05:52,483
WE ACQUIRE USERS
FOR A BLENDED AVERAGE

00:05:52,483 --> 00:05:54,453
OF ABOUT 4 TO 5 BUCKS.

00:05:54,453 --> 00:05:56,413

-IS THAT PAID MARKETING?

IT'S ACTUALLY SMART.
IT'S JUST EXPENSIVE.

00:06:10,423 --> 00:06:11,473
IT'S NOT THAT EXPENSIVE.

00:06:11,473 --> 00:06:13,503

ON PROFIT.

TO ACQUIRE THE CUSTOMER.

WE HAVE A 70% RETENTION RATE.

SO, OUR -- OUR USERS --
THE ONLY WAY YOU GROW IT

00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:27,523
IS THAT THEY ABUSE THE LAW
MORE AND MORE.

00:06:27,523 --> 00:06:29,393
THEY CONSTANTLY GET
MORE PARKING TICKETS.

00:06:29,393 --> 00:06:30,463

00:06:38,543 --> 00:06:40,543
BUT DAVID --
SO, I THINK IT'S HARD
FOR YOU TO FIND THE USERS,

00:06:40,543 --> 00:06:42,483

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
OF THIS SITE

THEMSELVES.
YES.

THAT'S WHERE, ON OUR END,
WE'RE RECRUITING

00:28:33,174 --> 00:28:35,144
AND WE'RE BUILDING OUT
A NETWORK OF INDIVIDUALS

00:28:35,144 --> 00:28:38,004
THAT ALREADY CREATE
SCHOLARSHIPS ON THEIR OWN.

00:28:38,004 --> 00:28:39,074

HOW DID YOU GUYS PAY
FOR COLLEGE?

00:28:52,054 --> 00:28:54,114
I, DURING UNDERGRAD,
RECEIVED A FULL RIDE

00:28:54,114 --> 00:28:56,094
IN OPTICAL ENGINEERING
AT NORFOLK STATE UNIVERSITY.

00:28:56,094 --> 00:28:59,044
AND THEN I HAVE A FELLOWSHIP
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA

00:28:59,044 --> 00:29:00,074
FOR OPTICAL SCIENCE.

00:29:00,074 --> 00:29:01,124
-AND WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND?
-VERY INTERESTING.

00:29:01,124 --> 00:29:03,024

I'VE STARTED

00:29:03,024 --> 00:29:04,104
THREE START-UP COMPANIES
IN MY PAST,

00:29:04,104 --> 00:29:06,124
BUT ALSO I'M A FORMER
COLLEGE BASKETBALL PLAYER.

00:29:06,124 --> 00:29:08,054
AND HOW THE IDEA CAME
TO FRUITION

00:29:08,054 --> 00:29:10,014
IS I LOST TWO
ATHLETIC SCHOLARSHIPS

00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:11,094
DUE TO SEASON-ENDING
INJURIES.

00:29:11,094 --> 00:29:14,164
YOU HAVE TO EITHER HAVE
A LOT OF DONORS

00:29:14,164 --> 00:29:17,054
OR YOU HAVE TO HAVE
A LOT OF APPLICANTS.

00:29:17,054 --> 00:29:18,124
BECAUSE THE VALUE TO DONORS

00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:21,024
IS YOU HAVE A VERY LARGE
BASE OF APPLICANTS,

00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,124
AND THE VALUE
TO THE APPLICANTS IS

00:29:22,124 --> 00:29:25,044
I'M GONNA GET MONEY
BESIDES FAMILY AND FRIENDS.

00:29:25,044 --> 00:29:27,044
I DON'T BUY
THAT THE FRIENDS AND FAMILY

00:29:27,044 --> 00:29:28,194
ARE GONNA PAY YOU 8%

00:29:28,194 --> 00:29:31,104
TO DONATE THE MONEY
THEY COULD GIVE YOU DIRECTLY.

00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:33,114
THE MARKET ACTUALLY SAYS
OTHERWISE IN SOME RESPECTS.

00:29:33,114 --> 00:29:35,074
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF STUDENTS ARE CURRENTLY

00:29:35,074 --> 00:29:36,114

ALREADY ON TOP OF IT.

00:29:38,114 --> 00:29:40,234

IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

00:29:40,234 --> 00:29:41,114

00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:43,104
I'M ALREADY INVESTED
IN HoneyFund AND PLUMFUND,

ON A BROADER SCALE.

00:29:46,144 --> 00:29:48,134
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU WON'T BE SUCCESSFUL,

00:29:48,134 --> 00:29:51,034

GOING TO INVEST IN

00:29:52,084 --> 00:29:54,004
SO, FOR THAT REASON, AND WITH
FULL RESPECT TO YOU GUYS,

00:29:54,004 --> 00:29:56,104
I'M OUT.

00:29:56,104 --> 00:29:58,064

OF TIME THINKING ABOUT IT.

THIS IS INTERESTING TO ME
BECAUSE IN SOME WAYS,

00:30:17,144 --> 00:30:23,064
MAYBE WE COULD DO SOMETHING THAT
INTEGRATES THE TWO TOGETHER.

00:30:23,064 --> 00:30:26,094

TO A STUDENT'S EDUCATION THE WAY
THAT A GoFundMe SITE GOES,

00:30:49,054 --> 00:30:51,154

FOR SETTING UP A SCHOLARSHIP

WHETHER AN INDIVIDUAL
OR FOUNDATION,

00:30:53,134 --> 00:30:55,104
AND I'M SEEING A PLATFORM
WHERE A STUDENT CAN COME

00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:57,184
AND FIND SCHOLARSHIPS THAT
THEY MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE FOR

00:30:57,184 --> 00:31:00,084
THAT WERE SET UP
BY AN INDIVIDUAL OR FOUNDATION.

ALL FOUR OF THOSE THINGS
ARE INTERESTING IDEAS.

I DON'T THINK YOU CAN TACKLE
ALL FOUR OF THEM.

I'M OUT.
