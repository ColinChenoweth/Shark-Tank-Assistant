00:00:00,603 --> 00:00:03,040
Narrator:
This is the Shark Tank,

00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,110
where entrepreneurs
seek an investment

00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:08,000
to start, grow, or save
their businesses.

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,270
Here I am, hugging a unicorn,

00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,170
asking for you
to invest in my idea.

00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,130
I got a flight of beers for you
guys. Who wants a taste?

00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,220
Narrator: If the Sharks hear
a great idea...

00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,080
This is fabulous.

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,280
...they'll invest
their own money...

00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,050
It's such a cool model.

00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,000
If you're nice, you might get
this for Christmas.

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,070
All right.

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,270
Narrator: ...And fight each
other for a deal.

00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,220
What multiple should
I put on cash flow?

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,120
You don't put it on cash flow
at this point.

00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,260
You will make
foolish decisions.

00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,290
Narrator: The entrepreneurs must
get the full amount

00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:34,290
they're asking for, or they'll
walk away with nothing.

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,290
You know doghouses
are real boxy.

00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,210
I know a lot about being
in the dog house.

00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,090
You'd want to be in this one.
This one's cute.

00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,100
You want to go into retail?

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,150
Very selectively.

00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,270
Oh, you're breaking my heart.

00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,270
I want to spank you
like a baby seal.

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,240
Narrator:
Who are the Sharks?

00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:55,130
They're self-made
business experts worth billions.

00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,000
Kevin O'Leary is
a shrewd venture capitalist

00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,120
who made his fortune

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,110
selling a children's
educational company

00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,090
for over $4 billion.

00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:08,050
Daymond John dominated
the fashion world with FUBU.

00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:11,120
Now he's the branding expert
behind multiple global brands

00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,070
generating billions in sales.

00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,230
Robert Herjavec, son of
an immigrant factory worker,

00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:21,240
founded one of the world's
preeminent cyber-security firms.

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,080
Lori Greiner, the queen of QVC,
holds over 100 patents

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,190
and has launched
more than 400 products,

00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,070
grossing over a half a billion
dollars in sales.

00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:35,020
And Mark Cuban,
esteemed billionaire tech mogul

00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,170
and the outspoken owner
of the Dallas Mavericks.

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,210
Schwartz:
My name is Henry Schwartz.

00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:50,090
I'm from Madison, Wisconsin,
and my company is MobCraft Beer.

00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,270
Cheers.
I love beer.

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,160
I love it so much that,
in college,

00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,220
my buddies and I decided
to start brewing our own beer

00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,090
to see what we could
come up with.

00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,120
It was so good, our friends
and family were asking for more,

00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,180
and everyone had suggestions

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,050
for what they wanted us
to brew next.

00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,240
All right.

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,180
We kept increasing
the size of our batches

00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,140
and soon partnered up
with a local brewery.

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,240
Next thing we knew, we had
our own craft beer company.

00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,020
Craft beer is a wildly growing
segment in the beer industry.

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,020
People are seeing the value
and care

00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,190
that goes into creating
small batches,

00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:19,140
and they want to support local
and independent producers.

00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,010
How about we do
an old-fashioned sour.

00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,240
Yes.

00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,010
Right now, we can't keep up
with the demand for our beer

00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,180
with the limited capacity
that we have.

00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,120
Our next step
is to build our own facility

00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,070
and start cranking out
lots more beer.

00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,190
There's huge growth potential
for us going forward,

00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,290
and a Shark would really make
that dream come true

00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,270
to help us grow
our brand nationwide.

00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,280
Hello, Sharks.
My name is Henry Schwartz,

00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,020
and I'm the president
of MobCraft Beer.

00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,180
Today, we're seeking $400,000 in
exchange for 16% of our company.

00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,130
At MobCraft, we put the consumer
in the driver's seat

00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,170
and turn their ideas into beer.

00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,090
MobCraft is the world's first
crowdsourced brewery,

00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,140
marrying the business model
of crowdsourcing

00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,260
and the industry of craft beer.

00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,250
We use 21st-century technology

00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:23,050
and the power of the crowd
to create unique craft beers.

00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,270
We give our customers voice
in two ways.

00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,210
One --
they submit ideas for beers,

00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,060
and two --
they vote on what's brewed,

00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,180
creating a direct,
emotional connection

00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,010
and building brand loyalty.

00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,130
So, here's how it works.

00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,290
Say you love wheat beers,

00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:39,000
and you want to try one with
coconut and cacao nibs in it.

00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,240
You would submit your idea
to MobCraft's website.

00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,050
From there, our brewmaster,
Andrew, vets that idea

00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,020
and turns it
into a viable recipe.

00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,040
It ends up in our monthly vote,

00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,160
then against craft beer fans
from across the U.S.,

00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,250
You rally your network
to get your beer brewed.

00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,250
With an investment
from the Sharks,

00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,210
we'll be able to build out
our own brewery

00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,090
and crowdsource a lot more beer

00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,110
to service the rest
of the United States.

00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,200
I know it's happy hour,

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,290
and I got a flight of beers
for you guys.

00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,290
Who wants a taste?

00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,010
Yeah.
Rock on.
All right.

00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:09,080
So, we got six beers
for you guys today.

00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,050
If you just want to grab
a paddle there.

00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,220
Herjavec: Wow.
All six for me?

00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,280
Mm-hmm.

00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,190
Which one first?

00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,000
Starting at the head of
the paddle -- by the handle.

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,110
By the handle.

00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:22,260
Remember that coconut
and chocolate wheat beer...

00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,070
Salut!
...that I was talking about?

00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,160
This was the crowdsourced winner
two months ago.

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,040
-That's really good.
-That's really good.

00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,200
-That's really good.
-No, it's a weird taste.

00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,000
I like this one a lot.

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,090
-Thank you.
-What's the second one?

00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,250
Next down the line
is the Hop Gose the Grapefruit.

00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,240
-Herjavec: Whoa.
-It has grapefruit in it?

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,210
It has grapefruit
and an ample amount of hops.

00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,290
Wow!
That's really good.

00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,230
-Thank you.
-Oh, no, it's not.

00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,210
[ Laughs ] All right,
let's move to the third one.

00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,230
This one
is our Bat... Crazy.

00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,070
Why does it look
like a Guinness?

00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,240
This is our silver medal winner

00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,100
at the Great American
Beer Festival...

00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,100
-Wow.
-...from last year.

00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,130
Is there coffee in it?

00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,290
5.6% ABV coffee beer.

00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,150
-Ahh.
-I'm drinking coffee and beer?

00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,150
Yep.

00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,010
Ew!

00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,120
Interesting.

00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,240
The next one down
is the Vanilla Wafer Porter.

00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,140
Vanilla Wafer?
This was the winner
in last month's voting round.

00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,210
Greiner: I love this.

00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,200
It's very tasty.

00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,100
This is fabulous.

00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,250
Oh, my God.
This is awful.

00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,090
All right. And the next two
are very interesting beers.

00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,120
These are both sour beers.

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,230
This is a sour Belgian double.

00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,040
-Mnh.
-Is there cider in it?

00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,290
Oh, that's got vinegar
in it.

00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,270
It's brewed very similar
to a Belgian style.

00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,200
[Yell, coughs ]

00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,200
-I like it.
-You do?

00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,090
I do.
This one's really good.

00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,120
What's the last one?

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,150
Schwartz: This one
is also a sour beer.

00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:31,020
Um, this one's
a sour red ale.

00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,220
O'Leary:
That is really bad.

00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,060
Oh, my God.
That's so good.

00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,140
-That's vinegar.
-Disgusting.

00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,040
Who drinks vinegar
like that?

00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,040
-This is really good.
-That's disgusting.

00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,050
Greiner: Well, at least
we've had a huge variety.

00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,240
That last one
is just brutal.

00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,180
So if you can imagine
the people that are...

00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,020
-Horrible!
-...submitting these ideas

00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,230
for beers
are the ultimate craft-beer fan.

00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,080
Let's shoot that guy.

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,000
No, I like that one.

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,180
Oh, Robert.
You can have mine.

00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,290
-O'Leary: That is disgusting.
-I like the vanilla one a lot.

00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:58,140
So if I tell all
my followers on social media

00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:02,010
to put in sardines
and chocolate chips,

00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,200
and it gets voted to the top,
you'll make it?

00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,070
So, there's a caveat to that.

00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,160
To vote, you have to back it up
with your dollars.

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,010
It is a pre-order
of that beer.

00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,200
Okay. How many do you
have to pre-order?

00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,150
It's a $25 pre-order
for four 22-ounce bombers.

00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,010
Walk us through an example.

00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,120
I want to get a beer made
with whatever Mark said.

00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,180
What'd you say, Mark?

00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,110
Um, sardines
and chocolate chips.

00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,210
So I want to get that made.
I go online.

00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,220
I put up $25 for sardines
and chocolate-chip beer.

00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,170
-Yep..
-[ Laughs ]

00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:31,130
You make it, because a lot of
other people love the idea.

00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,120
Where do I go get it?

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,250
We work with online
liquor stores

00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,160
to ship it
straight to your door.

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,120
How do they vote?

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,020
They vote
on the MobCraft website,

00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,140
and they vote by saying,
"If this beer wins,

00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,100
I'm putting a pre-authorization
on my card.

00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,040
If it doesn't win,
no charge goes through.

00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,240
Okay, so let's go through
the economics now.

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,260
Um, when we started
the company in 2013,

00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,220
we thought wineries in Wisconsin
can ship straight to consumers.

00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,080
Breweries probably can,
as well.

00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,140
We hit a big wall,
and that was not legal.

00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,190
So it took us about nine months

00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,020
to get the permitting
straightened out.

00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,150
So we work with online
liquor stores,

00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,190
and then we have negotiated
that we sell in volume to them,

00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,070
and they take
a smaller percentage

00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,150
than a traditional retailer.
Tell us your numbers.

00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:10,100
All said and done, we've sold
about $350,000 worth of beer

00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,020
and $280,000 of that has been
within the last 12 months.

00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,260
And what will you do
this year?

00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,050
This year we will do

00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,100
just shy of half a million
dollars in revenues.

00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,060
When -- are you gonna make money
off your 500K this year?

00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,120
Um, this year, since we're
building out a new facility,

00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,170
we'll have about a $28,000 loss.

00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:29,040
-Wow.
-So I'll back up a little bit.

00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,020
We launched it out of our
university in Wisconsin,

00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,220
and we just started homebrewing
batches of beer,

00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,030
and then we said, "All right,

00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,030
let's see if this can actually
be commercially viable."

00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,270
So we bought a brewery --
all the guts of one.

00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:43,160
How much money did you raise
to do all this?

00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,160
All said and done,
the founders put in $33,000.

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,000
So then you obviously have
a partner.

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,140
Yes. Two partners.

00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,070
And then we also have
an SBA 504 loan.

00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,150
How big's the loan?

00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,170
The -- the loan
was for $150,000,

00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,290
and that was used to purchase
the guts of that brewery

00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,270
that we started
using about half of it.

00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,020
What is your background?
Tell us about you.

00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,090
You know, I found my first
passion of skateboarding,

00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:07,240
and I wanted to go get a job
at the local skateboard store.

00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,090
And I went, talked to the guy.

00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,280
He said, "Hey, unfortunately,
we're not doing so hot.

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,200
We're gonna shut
the business down."

00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,170
So I was kind of discouraged,
went back home, and my mom said,

00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,010
"Henry, you love skateboarding

00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,090
and you want to work
at a skateboard shop.

00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,220
Why don't you see
if you can buy it?"

00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,020
I said, "Mom,
I'm 15 years old.

00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,270
How could I buy
a skateboard store?"

00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,010
And she said, "You are
passionate about this.

00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,010
If you put your mind to it,
you can achieve it."

00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,210
So we bought
that skateboard store.

00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,190
I ran it for three years
throughout high school,

00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,210
tripled the floorspace
and inventory.

00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,040
-Wow.
-What did you pay for it?

00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,270
Uh, we paid about
$8,000 for it,

00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:38,050
built it up to about $50,000
in revenues

00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,120
as a 15- to 18-year-old.

00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,180
And, Henry, how do people
find you?

00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,130
Are you doing beer events?

00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,070
We go to lots
of beer festivals.

00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,220
So we started out just going
in the state of Wisconsin.

00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,200
We went to every beer festival
that we could.

00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,190
They buy our beer --
How many beer festivals
are there?

00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,010
Do they have Oktoberfest?

00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,090
That was 65 beer festivals
in Wisconsin.
Wow.

00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:59,160
In any geographic location,
there's multiple microbrewers.

00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,110
This is a big trend
in beer.
Mm-hmm.

00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,210
But that practically none
of them run at 100% capacity.

00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,130
They run
at 40% to 60% -- 70%.

00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,030
Mm-hmm.

00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,280
So what I learned
about this business

00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,280
is the killer
is the capital outlay

00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,130
to build capacity to brew,

00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,040
when everybody else has already
spent their money.

00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,270
Yep.
I'm hooked on that.

00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,010
I was hoping you'd say,

00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,060
"Look, we use spare capacity
all around us."

00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,010
Yeah, you know, we've --
we've looked into it,

00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,040
and we've found
that with our customers,

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,150
the ones who really believe
that craft beer is a craft --

00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,140
they want to see the beer
brewed on the home front.

00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,190
So we've got commitment
from the bank,

00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,240
finance $1.9 million
of our build-out.

00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,030
So do you ever take one
out of the model

00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,270
and then go to traditional
distribution?

00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,270
Forget it.

00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,180
That's exactly
what we are doing,

00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,030
and that's what we've done.

00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,200
We're in Madison
and we're in 75 liquor stores

00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,180
and about 65 bars.
-How's it going?

00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,170
It's going very well.

00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,000
How much you making it for

00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,200
and selling it
to those retailers at?

00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,070
So, it depends
on the product segment.

00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:55,090
24-pack of cans
costs us about 28 bucks.

00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,240
It wholesales at $48.

00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,090
Wow.

00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,040
-That's...
-Wow.

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,070
That's tough.

00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,090
This is
really premium stuff.
Mm-hmm.

00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:04,060
Henry, what I thought you had
here when you came out --

00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,240
you have these huge advocates

00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,140
that are willing to spend an
inordinate amount of dollars...

00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,220
-Mm-hmm.
-...per beer.

00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,210
Crazy, because they're
part of this idea

00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,070
that they could brew
their own.

00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,010
Yep.
Everything else --
everything else puts you --

00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,160
And would it help if I told you
that those people

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,030
were the retailers, as well?
-No, no, but hang on.

00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,050
Everything else puts you
back in the competition

00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,190
of the regular
beer business.

00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,120
Once we have a few beers
that have been brewed and sold

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,120
in those new markets...
-Why do you feel so passionate

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,250
that you have to own
the equipment where
the beer is brewed? Why?

00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,120
I think you have
a really clever, unique way

00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,190
to go to market.

00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:36,100
It's a very high-end
product,

00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,200
but it's just not something
I have a passion for.

00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,180
So I-I-I'm not a beer guy.

00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,080
I'm out.

00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,220
Fine.

00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,260
Well, I r-- I really liked
the vanilla one.

00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,280
Mm-hmm.

00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,280
I thought the coffee one
was interesting.

00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,050
Kitschy market --
I get it,

00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:56,240
but I don't know enough
about brewing beer

00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,050
and how people are
gonna buy.

00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,210
I just can't see me
investing in this.

00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,240
I'm out.

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,020
Okay.

00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,260
Well, I-I hate beer.
So I can't help you. I'm out.

00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,100
All right.

00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,070
I love beer,
but I'm Bud Light.

00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,240
This is not my taste.
I know it's a hot area.

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,060
It's just not for me.
So I'm out.

00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,280
Henry, I think that you came up
with this incredible model

00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,240
to tap into
this amazingly hot trend...

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,030
Mm-hmm.

00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,100
...and you could make a ton
of money riding this wave.

00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,020
Narrator:
Four Sharks are out.

00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,040
Kevin is Henry's last chance
to get a deal

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,100
for his crowdsourced
beer company, MobCraft.

00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,260
Henry, I think that you came up
with this incredible model

00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,220
to tap into this
amazingly hot trend...

00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,080
Mm-hmm.

00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,230
...and you could make a ton
of money riding this wave.

00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,020
But you want to get dragged
into the toilet?

00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,220
Into retailing of beer
and building out facilities?

00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,140
Are you out of your mind?

00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,190
Why would you want to do that
to yourself?
I'll tell you why.

00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,210
There's a big quality-control
issue in a lot of the beer

00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:10,160
that you can make.
You're breaking my heart.
You're breaking my heart, Henry.

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,150
It's something that we can't
maintain the quality

00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,050
in someone else's facility,

00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,040
and that is something that will
really disappoint the customers

00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,190
and turn them away,
never to come back.

00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,050
So maintaining
that facility on our own --

00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,050
You know, I-I don't --
I don't believe that statement,

00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:24,060
because, I mean, look --
I-It's such a shame.

00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,090
I could show you
how to fix this

00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,140
and make you millions
of dollars,

00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,020
and you're too stubborn.

00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,220
I want to spank you
like a baby seal.

00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,050
-You got a paddle.
-You got a paddle right here.

00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,000
Just, like,
that is such a mistake.

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,070
-Oh, my God.
-He welcomes the spank.

00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,050
It's just -- that's terrible.
Listen, Henry.

00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,170
I'm sorry.
I'm heartbroken.

00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:44,290
It's such a cool model
with such a flaw.

00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,070
What a crime.

00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,190
Yeah. I don't believe that
that's true, but --

00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,190
-Are you in?
-It's true.

00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,100
I'm out.

00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,000
Henry, thank you.
high-quality product.

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,060
-Greiner: Thanks, Henry.
-Thank you, guys.

00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,190
Good luck.

00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,180
Schwartz: Kevin thought
I was a little silly

00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,080
for not outsourcing
my manufacturing,

00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,160
but in the craft-beer world,

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,130
it's really important
to have an identity,

00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,170
so I'm happy to be able to say
that we're gonna go through

00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,270
and build out
our brewery facility

00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,040
to make our wonderful beer.

00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:16,210
Narrator: In season 4,
we watched cowboy Ryan Ehmann

00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,110
make a deal with Daymond John

00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,170
for his exercise DVDs
"Lose 12 Inches in 12 Workouts."

00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:23,240
Now that's what
I'm talking about!

00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,070
Let's see
what he's up to now.

00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,220
These last three years
have been one heck of a ride.

00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,230
Whee!

00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:32,120
I did $80,000 in Internet sales

00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,170
in 6 weeks after airing.

00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:37,230
I was so sure that my online
business was gonna take off,

00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,270
so I made the decision
to close my gym

00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:42,130
and solely focus
on the Internet business.

00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,000
All of a sudden,
the Internet sales dropped off

00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,060
and I didn't know how
to pay my mortgage.

00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,220
I was scared, you know?

00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,010
I got two little kids at home.

00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,140
I got a wife,

It's all on my shoulders.

00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,040
That's when Daymond showed me
his true colors

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,140
and sent me a check
to pay my mortgage.

00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:08,170
He told me that I was the face
and the brand of the business

00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:11,250
and I needed to get back on my
feet and build it back up again.

00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,290
All right, ladies,
get on the bull!

00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,120
All: Go!

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,180
I spent two years
working like crazy

00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,170
to build a gym
that was rodeo-themed.

00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,020
I call it Cowboys Gym.

00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,210
Come on. Come on.

00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:25,210
My gym has been so successful,
I'm opening my second location.

00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:27,140
Between both gyms
and the Internet sales,

00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:30,070
I generated over $750,000.

-What's up?

00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,210
I decided to help Ryan out
because we've become friends,

00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,060
and I believed in him.

00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,230
He just made some really bad
business moves,

00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,060
but he learned his lessons
the hard way.

00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,280
I love it.

00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,030
This is truly different
than anything I've seen before,

00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,280
and franchising Cowboy Ryan's
workout program

00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,080
will definitely
put him on the map.

00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,100
So glad that we stuck
with each other.

00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,000
You can't give up, and if things
aren't going your way

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,210
in the business
you're working on,

00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,220
you've just got to rework it.

00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,150
You've got to just keep going.

00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,010
And it's pretty amazing
where I'm at now.

Hi, I'm Jeremiah Robison

My company is Beloved Shirts,

00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:36,110
and I am seeking $175,000
in exchange for 5%.

00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:42,040
The problem with the world today
is that it's just too serious.

00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,260
So we as a society
woke up one day,

00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,130
and everything
was just plain boring.

00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:50,030
So to combat the
over-seriousness of the world,

00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:52,030
I came up with Beloved Shirts.

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,070
I'm actually
a huge introvert,

00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,210
so you'd think I'd be fine
going by unnoticed

00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:07,060
in whatever lifeless clothes
I was wearing before,

00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,020
but my real personality,

00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,200
which is a lot weirder
than I let on,

00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,270
wouldn't stand
for a serious Jeremiah.

00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:18,020
So here I am,
a man hugging a unicorn,

to invest in my idea.

Yes, it's pepperoni.

So what --
what's the business?

00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,280
That was just for fun,
to show us the product.

00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,280
Yeah, so,
what we're passionate about

00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,030
is just creating apparel
that warrants a reaction.

00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,230
It's a way
to express yourself.

00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,220
We feel like we're selling
an experience

00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,170
and not just
a product here.

00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,270
Katy Perry had that fleece on

00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:11,060
Yeah, Katy Perry is
our biggest influencer by far.

00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,290
But was that pizza one yours
that she wore?

00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,120
Yeah.
That was ours.

00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,000
We didn't reach out
to her at all.

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,290
This was totally random,
and she just loves the brand.

00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,140
What -- What does it cost?

00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,240
Onesies -- by far our most
expensive item -- $129 retail.

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,080
And what's a t-shirt cost?

00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,270
T-shirt costs $39.95.

00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,090
And what are your margins?

00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:29,230
Our cost to goods sold
percentage range

00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,190
is between 58% and 60%
right now.

00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,080
Everything's made in the USA.

products do you have?

How much to you typically have
dollar-wise in inventory?

00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,000
So, to start this business, I
didn't invest in any inventory.

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,290
Like, in fact, all I needed
was $300 for my first sample.

00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,270
So everything's made-to-order,

00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:49,010
and that, you know,
it's bittersweet.

00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:51,190
It has its pros -- we don't have
to invest in inventory,

00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:54,050
we can put whatever we want
to market right away,

00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,120
but the turnaround times
is our biggest struggle.

00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,010
How long is the turnaround?

00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,230
Right now, we're advertising
30-day turnarounds

How much did you make
on the $2.3 million?

Last year,
our net profit was 10%.

00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,250
Okay, but should I pay
five times your cash flow?

00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,140
Value at $1 million --
is that what you're worth?

00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,210
I think we are on track
to really scaling this company

00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:25,070
and improving our profits

00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,070
just by simply automating
the back-end system.

00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,260
Our biggest struggle right now
is our turnaround times.

00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,280
You know --
Why haven't you automated it
up to this point?

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,060
We have 22,000 SKUs
on the website.

00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,160
-Wow.
-It's the artwork.

00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,040
-Oh, I hate that.
-That's a huge amount of SKUs.

00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,250
Why do you have so many?

00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,250
Well, it's all
the different sizes.

00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,140
So technically, it's a lot less

00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,090
when you see the amount
of designs,

00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,240
but we do all the way
up to 3XL and extra small.

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,000
You've put a value on your
business at $3.5 million.

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,050
I'm looking at it
as five times cash flow.

00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:58,060
You're smart enough to know
that's not an unreasonable --

00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,000
Kevin doesn't understand that
companies actually do grow.

they stay the same size.

What multiple
for a t-shirt company

00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,140
should I put on
cash flow?

00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,170
You don't put it on cash flow
at this point.

00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,210
You want to know
how he's gonna grow.

a disciplined investor.

what's your angle, right?

00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:18,290
Because the thing that concerns
me is you based it on hype.

-Uh, very selectively.
-Oof.

I want to be selective about the
retailers that carry our brand.

What are you gonna
use the money for?

So your margins are really
gonna change, though,

00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,040
you know,
if you go into retail.

00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,080
Like, right now,
you said you're making...

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,240
-60% margins.
-60%.

00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,220
But you're gonna have to
wholesale them.

00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,200
We -- we simply can't
go into mass distribution

00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,250
with our on-demand
business model.

00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,110
So part of the reason I'm here
for a partnership with a shark

00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:54,010
is to secure additional
manufacturing relationships

00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,070
where we can do these
high-volume runs.

what are you gonna use the --

the --
the $175,000 for?

00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,020
So primarily,
because I know

00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,040
we're good at
direct-to-consumer --

00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,210
that's something
I'm confident in --

00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,270
I do want to improve
our conversion rate

00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,070
by speeding up
those turnarounds.

00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,230
How many do you convert?

00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:10,210
So we are at a 1% conversion
right now, which is low.

00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,140
Just 1%?

was a legitimate idea or not --
