with the world.

The reason we want
to get a deal with a Shark

we couldn't dream of having.

Sharks, beer tastes great,
but it's got to be ice-cold.

But the problem with beer is

once you get down
to around here,

it ain't so ice-cold anymore.

had to be done.

We did do something.

for warm beer.

Have you ever done testing?

keep your beer cold?

C.A.B.-certified

00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:27,100
Basically, what it says is that
on a warm day outside,

00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,050
if you open your beer can,

00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,100

to consume it

before the
"warm beer suck zone."
Yeah.

00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,160
Now, by using
the Beer Blizzard disc,

to consume your beverage

same conditions

of that beer --

So, in 21 minutes --

It stays cold for 21 minutes
with or without an insulator?

With the insulator.
With the insulator.

00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,170
So, all testing was done
with the insulator.
Correct.

00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:53,100
You could use
any one of these, right?
That's correct.

00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,050
Every can insulator is designed
to that specification.

when you test it

and no Beer Blizzard?

So, you know,
you named it Beer Blizzard,

00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:32,040
but it could be
so much wider range to sodas

and anything
that's in a can, right?

00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,130

So, did you ever think
about that?

Like, that this -- this makes it
seem like it's just for beer?

00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:42,100
Yeah, I mean, when you look
at that, Lori, I agree with you.

00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,170

there hasn't been many times

in it, you know?

00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,040
Herjavec: How much did you raise
on Kickstarter?

00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,060
Our Kickstarter campaign
was awesome.

00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,190
Uh, we raised $43,000
in 45 days.,

00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,140
We hit our goal
in just three days.
Wow.

00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,110
And we had sales
to all 50 states

00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,090
and 45 countries
around the world.

00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,070
And what are your sales
a year later?

00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,210
A year later,
we sold 66,000 discs.

00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,180
We sell them in six-packs,
so that's 11,000 six-packs.

00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:51,280
The gross was $156,000,
and the net is $135,000.

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,100
I'm assuming all online.

00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,020
Uh, majority of it
is online.

00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,100
Oh, I love it!

00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,090
Hey, Ozzy,
where were you on TV?

00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,040
It says "as seen on TV."

00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,080
We just did that
for here.

00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,110
[ Laughter ]

00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,120
We -- We -- We wanted
to make it look good.

I wish I had
a better answer for you,

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,080
but we were drinking
when we came up with that.

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,080
[ Laughter ]

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,020
Have you approached
any beer companies

00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,070
about putting their logo
on this?

00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,120
Great promotional idea.

00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,120
Yeah, we've made calls,
and they don't return our calls.

00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,290
[ Speaking indistinctly ]
All: Ohh.

00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,090
What?!
They will now.

00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,070
What are you gonna use
the money for?

00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:22,140
We want to buy in volume
to get our costs lower per unit.

00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,120
By building up
our inventory,

00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,140
increasing our profit margin
for each one,

00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,140
we want to hire
a full-time fulfillment center

00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,060
that could handle the orders,
handle the shipments.

00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,100
Frankly, we're worried
if we're on here,

00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,160
we're gonna get pounded
with orders.

00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,280
I'm -- I'm scared
about it, honestly.

What is your, um, full-time job?
Or is this it?

00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,190
Uh, no. I'm, uh,
I'm an attorney in Pittsburgh.

But It's true.
I knew it. I knew it.
I knew it.

00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,160
What kind of law?

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,160
Um, I represent,
uh, the hardest-working people

in America, people that get sick
from breathing asbestos,

What does Ozzy do?

00:09:02,358 --> 00:09:04,040
I am the director
of quality food safety

and regulatory affairs

00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,120
for one of the nation's
leading food companies.

00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,190
Who's gonna
run the business, though?

00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:11,150
I mean, 'cause you --
you guys have both real jobs.

00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,080
If we can scale this up
the way we want to,

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,030
I made my mark
on the food industry,

00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,270
and it's time for me
to step down

00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,150
and run our business.

00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:20,050
Ozzy, I'm not sure you need
to step down.

00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:21,150
I-I mean,
you guys did a great job,

00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,130
and, I mean,
I love how you presented it.

00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,090
But I really think
it's a one-shot product.

00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:29,080
I really see it
as a promotional giveaway.

00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,110
I don't see it
as something

00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,020
you're gonna build
a business around.

00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,060

I just don't know the
clear direction to go with it.

00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,130
Even though you're gonna
make this a full-time job,

00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,130
it's not right now,
and I don't know

00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,110
if I have the time and energy
to make all those calls.

00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,020
I'm gonna have to pass
on this one. I'm out.

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,090
We're hard-working guys.
We're smart and dedicated.

00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:03,020
When we need to get
something done, we get it done.

00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,160
My clients --
I love my guys,

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,030
and I go up against the biggest
companies in the world

00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,090
that you can imagine.

00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:11,010
And when my guy walks into work
in the factory for 45 years,

00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,090
and he's dying
from mesothelioma,

00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,190
they're gonna try
and beat him up left and right.

00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:16,030
I stick up for him,
and I bust my ass to make sure

00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,120
that nothing happens
to that guy.

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,060

for your money,

00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,190
and we'll do the same thing
for this business.

If you give us a shot,
I guarantee it will turn around.

00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,150
But I'm just worried that,
you know, it's a product.

00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,090
It's not really
a company, right?
Correct.

and I like you.

00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,170
Not every business has to be
$10 million in sales.

You guys do half a million
dollars in sales at 70% margins.

00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,070
We'll all make money,
we'll all drink beer,

a good time.

make you an offer.

00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:47,050

for 20%?

just a promotional product.

taking that time?

We are seeking $2 million

When you hear "vending machine,"
what comes to mind?

Most people imagine desperately
shaking this old machine,

of potato chips to drop out.

about Vengo? Everything.

Let's start with size
and appearance.

Our slim-form factor
and attractive design

how it works.

What Vengo does is
we bring video content

our team at Vengo
back in New York

of the sale,

00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,180
and that's
just scratching the surface

00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,140
with everything we can do
with the valuable data

00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:43,000
from each and every vending
machine out in the field.

00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,000
It's that easy.

Who's ready to Vengo?

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,150
So, it's small in size.
Yes.

00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:55,030
Does that mean that anything
that you sell out of it

00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,120
has to be small in size?
Absolutely.

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,030
This is about the largest item
that we can fit,

00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:02,020
but we can actually fit
100 products.

00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,150
How do we fit so much
in so little

is we have an amazing team
of aerospace engineers.

Yes, that's

Uh...

And now you're making
vending machines.
Now I'm making
vending machines.

00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,070
Exactly.
I saw the opportunity,

00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,160
I quit my aerospace job,
and I jumped to this.

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,050
See what happened
with the space program?

00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,110
We're not
a vending operator,

00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:21,070
and we're not
replacing vending machines,

00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,080
but we are a software
and media company

00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,020

our business model.

00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,290
We sell the hardware
to vending companies.

00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:34,110
So, let's go from there.
So, let's go from there, right?
So, you're selling to
vending-machine guys and owners.

00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:36,040
Exactly.
So, let's go from there.

00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,060
What does one of those cost
for me to buy

00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,010
if I'm
a vending machine guy?
Yep.

00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,190
What does it
cost you to make?

00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:44,120
Yeah. You're not gonna
love this, so bear with me.

00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,020
We build it for $2,500.

00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,280
We <i>sell</i> it for $2,500.

00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,240
Boo!
[ Chuckles ]

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,090
I understand.
I got it.
Okay, so you charge
a monthly, then.

00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,120
So, what do you charge
on a monthly, then?

00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,050
Exactly. We charge you
$20 per Vengo per month.

00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,190
And what do I get
for that $20?

00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:01,150
You get the front-end software
that controls the hardware.

00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,170
Do I -- Does that include
maintenance in case it breaks?

00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,120
Exactly. Yep.
We're --
Okay.

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,120
So, then do --
do the different companies

00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,080
that you sell this to
select and choose

00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,010
what's going to
go in the machine?

00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,090
We control
the media rights,

00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:18,070
and we control a significant
amount of the product mix.

00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,140
And so, you can get
some of your products in

00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,220
as the owner
of the hardware,

00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,070
but we're also managing
this network remotely...
Right.

00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,190
...working with
really great products

00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:30,100
to get them into the Vengos
across the whole network.

00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,180
What are
your total sales?

00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,070
For this year, we're going to
generate $1 million.

00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,160
Wow.
We just partnered

00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,150
with the largest vending-machine
company in the country.

00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:43,140
But, Brian, you make money
from the front of the screen.

00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,090
You're an ad company.
Plain and simple, right?
Absolutely.

00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:49,080
Let me tell you guys
what we're doing here.
Okay.

00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,010
We are changing the game
on retail

00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,030
and marketing
physical products.

00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,120
That's a stretch.

00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,060
Traffic into stores is down 50%
over the last 3 years.

00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,040
The impulse purchase
at the checkout

00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,080
at the grocery store
is down significantly.

00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,170
Herjavec:
Brian, so, I'm an advertiser.

00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:09,060
I want to advertise
on the front of the screen.

00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,090
How do you charge me?

00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,130
So, we're charging brands

00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:16,140
$200 per SKU
per machine per month.

00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,280
Wow.
Whoa.
What happens if they don't --

00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,090
That's -- That's a lot.
Shimmerlik: And what --
And what that gets them is

00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:23,070
we actually purchase
the product wholesale.

00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,110
We sell it at retail.

00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,050
We make sure
our vending partners can make

00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,140
an attractive margin
and the product is --

00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:30,050
So does it fit --
Guys, guys, look, I get it.
This is a digital end cap.

00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,140
This is a digital end cap,
right?
Yeah.

00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,170
Which is great.
But here -- here's my issue.

00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:37,130
I invested in a company called
Oasis by women out of Boston.

00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:40,020
They go into
women's restrooms

00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,150
and all the products
are women's.

00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,110
Now, we've designed
our own box.

00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:46,080
I see them as competitive,
so for those reasons, I'm out.

00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,150
Understood.

00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,100
[ Speaks indistinctly ]
Brian, why don't you
talk about

00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,170
the $16 million valuation you've
put in front of the Sharks here?

00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,050
John: Yeah, absolutely.
[ Greiner chuckles ]

00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,180
Let's jump into that.
$2 million for 12.5%.

00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:57,070
I'm gonna make the assumption
it's not supported by cash flow

00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,140
because you don't have any.

00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,040
So, there must be
some other reason

00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,080
you think
you're still valuable.

00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,090
It must be
that you have --

00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,020
Have you raised
the money al-- already?

00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,180
We've raised $3.4 million

00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,200
from some of
the best investors out there.

00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,220
The best investors in America
are right here.

00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,150
You're talking to them.
Exactly.
That's why we're here.

00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:14,290
And we always get great pricing.
I make sure of that.

00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,190
I know you do.

00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:18,110
Just explain to me how
it's worth $16 million today.

00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:20,130
You might do $1 million in sales
this year.
Yeah.

00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:22,110
Will you make any money
on that $1 million?
No, we will not.

00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:24,160
We will lose
about $300,000,

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,080
uh, and then next year,
we will break even.

00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,170
And so why is it worth
that much?

00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:33,070
We've got an amazing team,
and we've spent three years

00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,190
building out this platform.

00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,170
I've partnered --
Let's not forget I've partnered

00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:39,140
with the largest vending company
in the country,

00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,220
and we've partnered
with the nation's largest

00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,130
chocolate manufacturer, as well
as several other big brands.

00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:49,090
It's very smart
to have point of purchase video

00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:51,070
if you can have it
in something.
Exactly.

00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,040
But on here,
do they have to be relative

00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,140
to what's inside the machine,

00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,040
or are you selling
advertising space to anything?

00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,070
We're focused
on the differentiator.

00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:04,050
The differentiator
is coupling retail,

00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,210
point of purchase
with media,

00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:09,050
extracting tons of data
about how consumers behave.

00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:12,250
Guys, the valuation
is <i>insane.</i>

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,060
I'm out.

00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,080
Thank you.

00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,100
Uh, I don't like it.

00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,040
What I find confusing
about it

00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,150
is you're in
the advertising business,

00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:27,030
and there's a lot of competition
for point of sale advertising,

00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,080
but you're also
selling product,

00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,130
but you're only selling products
that are in the machine,

00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,190
and one day, maybe,
if you get big,

00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:36,110
you'll do advertising
for other things, too.

00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:40,110
So, is it
a display-advertising company,

00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,170
or is it a pseudo vending?

00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:45,030
This business model is
just too complicated

00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,290
and unfocused for me.

00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:48,140
I'm out.

00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:52,040
Guys, can I ask if your balance
sheet has any debt on it?

00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,010
We have
absolutely no debt.

00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,230
How would you like some?

00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,100
Narrator:
Three Sharks are out,

00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,070
but Kevin may be interested
in Brian and Steven's

Vengo.

00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:15,040
Guys, can I ask if your balance
sheet has any debt on it?

00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,090
We have
absolutely no debt.

00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,160
How would you like some?

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,060
I'm open to it. I'm open
to hearing what you got.

00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,050
What about I lend you --

00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,110
This goes into
my venture debt fund --

00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,030
I give you $2 million,

00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,030
and I'll take 6%
of the company in equity,

00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,130
which is half of you asked.

00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:32,290
So, $2 million in debt.
Yeah.

00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,200
And...

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,220
I'll loan the company
a 36-month loan -- 3 years.

00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,100
Okay.

00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,160
That's enough
for proof of concept here.

00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,180
$2 million,
and I want 6% of the equity

00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,140
for providing
the facility.
Okay.

00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,100
That's why they call me
Mr. Wonderful.

00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,050
And there's no interest payments
on the debt

00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,110
and there's
no strings attached?

00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,140
Oh, you got to pay interest.
Are you kidding? It's a fund.

00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,040
It has to make at least 7%
is my lowest rate.

00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,120
Horrible!

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,210
Here is
"Mr. Advice With No Checkbook."

00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,130
Isn't that wonderful?
I'm the only Shark up here --

00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,150
No one's written
more checks

00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,070
or bigger checks
on this show than I have,

00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,280
and I'm telling you
what you already know.

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,030
It's horrible.

00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,150
I have a venture debt fund.

00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:06,090
This is what I do all day long
with tech companies.

00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:07,180
So, Mr. Wonderful...
Yes.

00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:11,060
...how did you calculate 6%
on the equity side?

00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,010
I just asked for it.

00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,130
[ Laughter ]

00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,120
It's just what he wants.
It's that easy.

00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,040
I just want to wet my beak
in the equity, and I deserve to.

00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,260
That's a big, old beak.

00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,160
I love my beak.

00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,080
I look at this, and it's
a little confusing for me.

00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,000
If you're going up
on a wall, right,

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,080
you're taking up that space,

00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,150
so the space below it
now is empty.

00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:34,060
I don't see why
you wouldn't lengthen that.

00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,090
It's a little odd to me
at the moment.

00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:40,010
Like, I-I personally feel
it needs some work.

00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:40,408
Lori, is it possible,

00:20:40,408 --> 00:20:43,080
given our asking for a
significant amount of money...

00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,130
You are.
...is it possible

00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:47,070
that you guys would consider
coming in together?

00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,160
Have you guys
ever partnered up before?

00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,150
O'Leary:
I think -- I think I'll bring
you in on that deal, Lori.

00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:53,050
I mean, you've raised
a lot of money.

00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,180
You're asking
for a lot of money.

00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:57,110
With $3.4 million,
we've built a network

00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:01,010
of 150 machines,
soon to go to 250,

00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,050
we've partnered with

00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,210
the largest vending company
in the country.

00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:08,020
The vending market is a large,
slow-moving industry.

00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,090
It's $7 billion.

00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:12,160
So, there's a lot of opportunity
here to create retail.

00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,090
So, if I go in with Kevin at
the deal that he offered you...

00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,100
And I'd be happy to do
a debt deal with you,

00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,030
but the --
the 6% is -- is --

00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,110
Well, what's your counter?

00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:27,020
My counteroffer would be
$2 million at a 7% interest rate

00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,020
for 1% equity.

00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,100
Oh, that's not enough.
1%?

00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,190
I don't get out of bed
for that.

00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,210
But also, too, we work
really hard for our money.

00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:36,040
It's huge
to get two Sharks.
But we work hard
for our money, too.

00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,130
It's huge
to get two Sharks.

00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,010
You're asking for
a lot of money, though, guys.

1% is a no.
That's clear.

That's my last counter.

00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:50,170
1% of equity? That's all
you're willing to give up?

I'd love to make a deal
with you guys,

in the range of the market.

about to make another counter.

You get two Sharks.

It's a 7% interest loan

which is enough
to prove your concept,

00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,260
and we want, when we close
the deal with you,

00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,120

a little bit higher --

Here's the difference.
Venture debt from any firm...

...is one thing.

Brian?

00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:09,020
It would be 2.5% of the equity,
and we'll pay you back,

in business.

00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:31,100
and we've sold $260,000
in 18 months.

00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,040
On pasta sauces?
Not these?

00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,030
Yeah.
How much of these
have you sold?

00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:37,100
We just launched those,
so our first --

00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,110
our biggest customer
is Walmart Supercenters.

00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:40,240
But you're doing
a great job,

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,170
so why move from pasta sauces to these?
Good for you. That's good.

00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:45,070
Well, we've had
several challenges

00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,110
with our pasta sauces.

00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:48,100
First, the retail price
is $4.99,

00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,190
which proved to be
really expensive.

00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:52,050
I'm not making enough money
with the pasta sauces.

00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,150
Our markup was 23%.
Oh.

00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:56,110
And we're not turning them
fast enough to see any capital.

00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,190
So, you're selling,
but you're not making money.
Exactly.

00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:01,100
I'm just interested --
When will these get on the shelf

00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,070
so that someone can buy it,
try it,

00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,080
come back,
and buy it again?

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,190
October.
These will sell for $1.99,

00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:07,180
so we're gonna be cheaper
than the competition.

00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,270
And how much is your margin
gonna be on these?

00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,080
40%.

00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,120
I have to be honest here.
I did not love them.

00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,090
I found them a little hard
to drink.

00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:20,020
And I think
maybe it'd be a good idea

00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,290
to keep formulating
a little bit.

Lori, but no, and I understand
where you're coming from,

00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:28,150
but we've done -- I mean,
we tasted it with 2,000 people,

00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:30,050
and the Veggie Burst was
one of the favorites.

00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,170
Really?
Listen, you know what?

00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,110
Everybody's palates
are different.
Yeah, and I --

00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,000
And I truly am not trying
to put this down.

00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,368
No, and that's okay.

00:29:35,368 --> 00:29:37,290
But I definitely need
to be out on this deal.

00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,090

I'll give you this credit.

on the show,

and they talk about trying
to get distribution,

00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:46,250
and you've gotten distribution
in Walmart.

00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,120
Yeah.

raised money to do this?

Um, my mom has invested
$100,000.
Ouch.

So, this product,
we're selling it at a price

00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:58,170

You haven't sold it yet.

Well, but -- Well, the price
will be at $1.99,

for vegetable-based products

portable, that are affordable.

00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:08,170
I'm just worried if somebody
actually drank the whole thing,

00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:11,030

of the flaming sphincter.

that having a bad taste...

Mm-hmm.
...is bad.

This is good for you,
so maybe that's --

00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,180
that's a marketing angle.

00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:27,060
But the challenge with this is,
in the cold-pressed market,

00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,130

very particular products.
