of the strip
and then this cup format,

00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,180
and also, most importantly,
is the algorithm

00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,050
that we use to color-calibrate
for the strip

00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,160
and, um, the app
to recognize the colors.

00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,040

-with the strips...
-Exactly.

you're simplifying it

to a consumer-friendly
product.

Our patents do cover,
um, a wide range of uses.

00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,120
And so, you know,
a logical next extension

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,180
of this product
is in the human market.

00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,090
Kutcher: To me, the biggest
barrier to entry on this thing

00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,120
is collecting the sample
from the dog.

00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,010
Like, I really don't
want to do that.

00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,050
Now, I have two dogs.

00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,200
If one of my dogs
is really sick,

00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:08,080
I would -- I would actually
do this on behalf of my dog.

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,090
But I've seen things
in the human space

00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,120
where you can take a blood
sample, really, really simple,

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,080
and I would think
on behalf of a pet,

00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,110
it'd be a lot easier
to just give one little prick

00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,060
on the pet,
take a tiny blood sample,

00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,050
and do that test
than be underneath the dog,

00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,140
trying to collect
a urine sample.

00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:25,080
Vets don't generally do
the blood tests at home

00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,100
because pet parents
don't like to prick

00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,170
the animal or the pet
and get blood that way.

00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:32,070
So, Stephen,
I'm still trying to understand

00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,110
where the value add
to the consumer is.

00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:37,120
Is it a cost saving
over going to a vet?

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,160
Initially, it is
proof of concept that we have.

00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,110
We thought
the check-engine light

00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,100
was gonna be
a very valuable proposition.

00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,040
Well, the difference is
a check-engine light is passive.

00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,060
Mm-hmm.

00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,140
In your case,
there's got to be an action

00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,060
that caused me to go
stick my hand under my dog

00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,080
while he's peeing.

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,090
We realize that the impetus
to put it under

00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,060
is if the vet tells you
to do so.

00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,070
So it's vet-driven?

00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,060
We definitely
want to go the vet route.

00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,200
The problem is my vet
wants me to bring my animal in

00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,190
as many times as I possibly can.
Yeah, yeah.
You have to do that, too, right?

00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:06,050
Why's my vet gonna give me
this really convenient thing?

00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,290
Say, "I don't
have to charge you anymore.

00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,170
Here. Take this cup."

00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,210
Yeah. See, I think
it's a consumer play.

00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:13,030
Herjavec:
Look, I admire the fact
that you've sold 10,000.

00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,030
I'm still amazed by that,

00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,070
but I'm not sold
on the business model.

00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,160
Vets want to make more money,
not less money.

00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,180
I believe in this product,
but I also have to really

00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,280
believe in a very clear
distribution channel.

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,130
Mm-hmm.

00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,050
I think you're early.
I'm out.

00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,070
Okay.
Thank you.

00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,180
O'Leary:
Walks us through the numbers.

00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,230
What's the revenue gonna be
for this calendar year?

00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:38,120
Um, we're projecting $200,000
in sales this calendar year.

00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,180
Okay, so you're not making
any money yet.

00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,130
So, next year,
we're projecting, hopefully,

00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:47,030
$400,000 in sales with these
new specific-disease tests.

00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,100
That market makes up
590 million tests

00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,060
that potentially can be done.

00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,080
But it's not clear yet,
Stephen,

00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,130
what the go-to-market
distribution strategy is.

00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,170
We're talking about vets,
direct sales online,

00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:00,040
maybe retail,
if you can find enough margin.

00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,050
That's not clear yet.

00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,120
These are all
to be determined, right?

00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,130
Yes.
There's a bit of risk
in your deal

00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,070
in terms of
what's gonna happen.

00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,170
And you're a little
prerevenue-ish.

00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,200
You know, what I love
about "Shark Tank" deals

00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,140
is when it's already proven
what the channel's gonna work.

00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,070
I pour $300,000 on it.
It's just like gasoline on fire.

00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,290
It explodes.
You're not there yet.

00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,200
Okay.

00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,120
What are the -- You said there
were four patents that you had.

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,270
The patents cover
any specimen --

00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,040
like, specific-use cases.

00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,150
And so if it's the human market,

00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:29,140
we can also do water testing,
milk and dairy testing.

00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,120
There's a lot of different
applications --

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,090
But it's all strip --
But it's all strip --

00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,070
It's all strip, yes.

00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,080
That's the key, right?

00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,060
I'm very involved
on the human side.

00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,280
I've got investments
in a company called Biomeme

00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,020
that does blood analysis.

00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,060
My point is that being
strip-driven,

00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,050
I think,
will have a life cycle.

00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:50,060
I just don't see it
as a long-term life cycle.

00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,120
I see that as a problem.
I'm out.

00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,070
Okay.
Thank you.

00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,110
Kutcher: I think you have
something interesting,

00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,090
and I think there's a market
for this.

00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:02,110
And there are real channels
to get to pet owners

00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,280
that care about their pets
that little bit more.

00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,130
Mm-hmm.

00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,150
My biggest concern
is still around

00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:12,110
the very first question
that we had around collection.

00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:15,070
I think
that you're gonna be disrupted

00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,100
by a bunch
of other platforms

00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,200
that can do the same thing
that you do

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,130
without the messiness
of having to do a urine sample.

00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,050
And so, for that reason,
I'm out.

00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,150
Thank you.

00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,070
I thought Ashton
was going to make you an offer,

00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,110
'cause you know, Ashton,
you can sell a lot

00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,070
before somebody else comes out
with something better.

00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,120
I think I can get this out there
to the consumer.

00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,270
I try to skate
to where the puck is going,

00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,070
not to where the puck is.

00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:45,240
And I don't think that that's
where the puck is gonna be.

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,060
O'Leary: There's technology,

00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,090
and then there's
distribution risk.

00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:56,020
I'm more concerned
about distribution risk --

00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,140
how you blow
this thing out

00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,040
so you sell
a few million dollars of it.

00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,140
I want to reflect that
in my offer.

00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:05,040
I'll do the $300,000
for 15%.

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,100
Mm. Okay.
Herjavec: Interesting.
Wow.

00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,150
Kutcher: You know, Kevin,
I've watched this show a lot.

00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,130
Your deals
always have ratchets, levers,

00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,020
you have the some royalties,
some plug-in hooking --

00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,050
No, I'm really good
at that.

00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,130
I'm the most creative shark
in structure.

00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,090
Are you gonna ask him
why he likes this one?

00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,110
You can call it creative.

00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,170
I'm learning
what not to do.

00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,080
I call it founder abuse,
but you can call it creative.

00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,080
I'm really curious
about why you're offering

00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,160
a straight equity deal
on this.

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,070
I do them occasionally,
but I think this is a play

00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,050
on trying to figure out
which channel works

00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,120
and then pouring
gasoline on it,

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,080
because at this point,
he doesn't even know

00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,110
how he's gonna sell it.

00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,080
So there's no point
in ratcheting anything.

00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,120
There's nothing
to ratchet.

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,220
If there was, trust me,
I would do it.

00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,120
I think it's interesting.

00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,070
I like your four patents.

00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,110
I've sold a lot of products
over the last 18 years.

00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:57,060
And I have seen so many people
spend so much on their pets.

00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,090
And they want to make sure
that they're okay.

00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:02,020
I'm gonna make you an offer.

00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,290
$300,000 for 20%.

00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,070
I don't really see this
as a QVC television product.

00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,140
Oh, QVC would crush it.
QVC would crush it.

00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,040
Yeah, QVC, retail, online --
everything.

00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,100
I think we all do that.

00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,270
And you want him to pay
an extra 5% in equity for that?

00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,000
That's not worth it.

00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,180
I think I'm worth it.

00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,080
Narrator:
Three Sharks are out.

00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,110
Stephen has two offers
on the table

00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:39,030
for his pet-health indicator,
Petnostics.

00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,070
You've got Lori --
$300,000 for 20%.

00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:44,050
She's bringing QVC, retail,
all kinds of things.

00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:47,080
She thinks she's worth
an extra 5%.

00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,140
Kevin's in $300,000 at 15%.

00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,010
What are you gonna do,
Stephen?

00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:57,110
I know Lori
will bring the retail side.

00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:01,060
Um, Kevin will really bring
the veterinary clinic side.

00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,070
I will.
But I challenge you.

00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,110
I want to do both.

00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,170
I would do both, too,
though.

00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:08,020
But, you know,
this queen of QVC thing,

00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:08,391
I've got news.

00:12:08,391 --> 00:12:11,000
I went on QVC recently.
-Oh, no.

00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,338
You ready?

00:12:11,338 --> 00:12:13,050
This is gonna hurt Lori
a little.

00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:20,050
In 3 minutes and 40 seconds,
I sold $500,000 of wine.

00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,090
I was crowned the king of QVC
that moment.

00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,060
He crowned himself
the king of QVC.

00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,050
No one has ever sold
that much wine ever

00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,120
from a single brand
on QVC.

00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,290
The point is, anybody can do QVC
and sell a lot of stuff.

00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,180
What are you gonna do,
Stephen?

00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:40,060
I guess, Lori,
can I ask you one question?

00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,020
Would you consider
$300,000 for 15%?

00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,260
Oh, equaling Kevin's offer,
Lori.

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,160
I feel, at 15%, you know,
as much as I really do love this

00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,170
and I think it's a great product
and my thought would be --

00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:55,290
Queen, come here for a second.
The king is speaking.

00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,170
Ugh.

00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:59,020
If you want to split the deal,
I'll do 50/50 for 20%.

00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,060
20%.

00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,270
This is because you didn't move
fast enough in some ways.

00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,270
20%...

00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,080
50/50 -- king and queen.

00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,280
-You had 15%.
-20%...

00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,070
Queen and joker.

00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:15,020
It's the only offer
on the table now.

00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,060
I'm in.
Thank you, guys.

00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,150
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.

00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,040
Thanks, man.
Good presentation.

00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,040
And I get the dog.

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,160
Thank you, Lori.
Thank you so much.

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,110
-Good idea.
-Thank you so much.

00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,030
Come on, Austin.
Let's go.

00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,100
Cuban:
Good job, Austin.

00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,120
-Congratulations, Stephen.
-Come on. Here we go.

00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,050
-Good job, guys.
-Cute.

00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,030
-Aww.
-Aww.

00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,040
Here we go.
Come on.

00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,290
Greiner: Aww,
that dog is the cutest.

00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,070
I'm feeling good, I think.

00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,220
To get a deal with Lori
and Kevin,

00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:44,120
they both bring a good balance
in terms of where we want to go

00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,180
and where we are seeing success
right now.

00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,280
And so I am very, very happy
that we got a deal.

Lobster online is probably
a hard thing to sell.

but the problem is, the way
you explain your company,

00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:56,030
it makes it seem like you
don't have your stuff together.

00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,040
And I feel like
you're hiding something.

I step out.

I think, you know,
they look very nice.

00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:11,090
But the problem for me
is I don't have confidence

00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:13,160
in the way you're running
the business at all.

00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,140
You've had a lot of issues
and you've lost a lot of money.

00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:21,230
And I can't invest
in a company like that.

00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,090
I'm out.

00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:25,160
Yeah, they look nice,
but I don't know

00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,060
if there's a big market,
especially at that price.

00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,140
But you lost $9 million,

00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,210
and you're still not
out of the woods.

00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:35,120
And then your projection
to go to $34 million next year

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,240
would be astronomical
in that period of time.

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,250
I'm out.

00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:44,070
Look, put aside
the losses, right?

00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,080
That's not unusual in
a start-up company,

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,050
particularly
consumer electronics,

00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:50,050
particularly
where you've had to pivot.

00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,020
But from an investment
perspective,

00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,050
it really comes down to

00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,100
a million-dollar bet
on this, right?

00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,030
Because this is gonna be
the foundation

00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,050
for your 60% sales
in Christmas.

00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:02,110
But it's just a singular bet.

00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,130
And that's the part
I'm not comfortable with,

00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,060
particularly
on the valuation.

00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:10,020
And so I'm just
not convinced.

00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,020
For those reasons, I'm out.

00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,090

We all have one of these --
our most prized possession.

00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:15,110
It's with us 24/7,
yet half the phone does nothing.

00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,160
The back of the phone

00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,100

So my question to you, Sharks,
is, who's in?

00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,090
What happens
to the front of the screen?

00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:07,050
So the front of the screen
is completely off,

00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,080
and that's the beauty.

00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,000

of unlocking your phone,

-Do we get samples?
-Yeah, absolutely.

00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:16,100
It's not a dual screen?
I just want to be clear on that.

00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,060
I can't have both on

00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,090
Yes, you can.
Absolutely.

So there's a button
on the side there.

00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:28,060
If you hold down the button
for about a half a second,

00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,150
it'll actually cycle
through images.

00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:31,180
We've put
some of your favorite quotes

00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,100
and some other images on there
for you guys.

00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,120
How does it work?

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,160
Yeah, so it actually
is an e-paper screen,

00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,020
so very much like you have
in your e-reader.

00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,050
We've customized the screen

00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,210
to make it super low power
and extra durable.

00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:45,150
And it's connected wirelessly
to the phone via Bluetooth.

00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,190
So you set up
that information

00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,160
on the front-side application.
-That's right.

00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,230
And then
the front-side application

00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:52,110
delivers what you want
to the back side.
That's correct.

00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:55,120
Tell me the biggest value point
to the consumer.

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,140
It saves you time, and we know
time is money, right?

00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,110
So, for me,
when I'm running around my day

00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,110
and just having
that basic information around

00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:03,090
and being connected
is a huge saving for me.

00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:05,030
And how much are you selling
each one for?

00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,050
For $129 today.

00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,170
And what's your cost
right now?

00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:10,070
So the product you hold
in your hand today

00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,210
-is about an $80 cost point.
-Wow.

00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:15,020
But we have $41 quotes in hand
from the manufacturers

00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,050
for volume production.

00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,100
-$41?
-$41.

00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,090
-And that's all in?
-That's all in, landed costs.

00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:22,080
How much is the tooling
for each?

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,060
It's about $50,000
per tooling cycle.

00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,210
So to tool up
for all the different phones

00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:28,100
that are out there,
it's gonna be a lot of money.

00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,040
That's right. So what we're
doing is focusing on iOS.

00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,070
So luckily,
there's only two major models --

00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,100
the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,140
How much money
have you lost,

00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,220
and when do you think
you'll break even?

00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:39,120
We've spent about $1.6 million
to date on the development.

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,080
When do you think
you'll break even?

00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,040
We think we'll be
cash-flow-positive

00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,050
in July of next year.

00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:45,170
Herjavec:
I mean, I love technology.

00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:48,080
I've been in the technology
business for a long time.

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,120
Sometimes I'm wildly right.

00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,070
Sometimes I fall in love
with stuff and I'm wildly wrong.

00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:54,110
It's very cool.
It's a beautiful design.

00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:57,110
But I see this market moving,
actually, a different way.

00:25:57,110 --> 00:26:00,110
I think where this is moving to
is a wearable technology.

00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:02,170
We don't see it necessarily
competing with the wearables.

00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:04,160
Wearables, I think,
have a different use case.

00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,000
I think, for me,
the wearables are great

00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,030
for small bits of information

00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,120
like notifications,
things like that.

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,070
But this is a terrible
user experience.

00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,000
Dick Tracy would argue
with you.

00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,335
[ Laughs ]

00:26:13,335 --> 00:26:17,280
Yeah, for me,
I see it going to a wearable.

00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,170
I'm out.

00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:21,130
The lock screen is really
your competition, right?

00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:24,070
Because it's becoming
more and more powerful.

00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,100
Notifications
are getting a lot stronger,

00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,020
people are using the lock
screens for more things.

00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,040
The problem
is you need to come up

00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,130
with something new, different,
and exciting,

00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,170
and this has the potential
to be that.

00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:38,040
You know, if all of a sudden,
15 people you know walked in

00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,140
and, boom,
there comes their picture,

00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,110
or you're scrolling
through their picture

00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,190
because they're
in the same room,

00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,220
that's something different,
new, and exciting, right?

00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,140
Absolutely. And I think we can
build exactly on your point.

00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,090
So I think the real
great advantage of this

00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,110
is the screen's always on.

00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,060
So within context,
you can update the screen

00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,070
to serve information.

00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,100
So whether it's at a Mavs game

00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,100
and giving you
relevant information...
Yeah.

00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,120
...or it's walking into a store
and getting a coupon

00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,100
or an advertisement
that you transact with.

00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,080
It's a land grab.
You have to win.

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,120

O'Leary: It's a land grab
for the accessory.

00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,130
So you're left with what's left.
That's what I'm hearing.

00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:09,080
If they put on
their own second screen.

00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,060
Well, I think we're going
in that direction.

00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,060
I think we're definitely
heading in that direction.

00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,070
The problem that we have
and the reason why nobody

00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:17,090
goes with a second screen
is just battery life, right?

00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:20,080
Right. But this has
a battery-life issue too.

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,120
It's one week,
it's an e-reader,

00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,080
it's low battery...
-I get that, but --

00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,080
...which makes
a lot of sense.

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,080
As we debate
his business plan,

00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,110
'cause that's
what we're doing...

00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:30,090
-Wait, I have a question.
-...I'm looking at it,

00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:31,190
saying to myself,
"I'll give you $500,000.

00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:33,160
I get 5%. I'm the smallest guy
in the cap table."

00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,130
You're welcome to give more.
You get a bigger space.

00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:38,090
I have to pay
the full pop valuation

00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:40,130
while we're still debating
what the direction is

00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:42,110
because we don't agree,
and that's okay,

00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:44,150
but that also reflects
the amount of risk in this deal.

00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:46,170
I'm gonna look at it
from that perspective.

00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:49,020
I don't think the risk/reward
is there for me.

00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,000
I'm out.

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,060
Okay. Great.
Thank you.

00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,200
Greiner:
I have a question for you.

00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,140
To Ashton's point, are you
trying to drive the price down?

00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,180
Yeah, we want to be
lower priced,

00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:01,100
and I think our sweet spot
will be probably about $99.

00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,280
I've sold million of dollars
of cellphone cases --

00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,030
purely decorative.

00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,090
It's a great market,

00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:11,020
and obviously one that's going
to be growing and growing.

00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,050
The down part for me

00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:14,080
was always that you're never
catching up, right?

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,160
Cellphones are constantly
getting bigger and bigger.

00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,170
It's something
you're always chasing after

00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:20,210
because just as you get
a lot of inventory in,

00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:24,030
it's like one hit, and then
you've got to be changing again.

00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:26,030
And the tooling,
as we've talked about,

00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,050
is extremely expensive.

00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:28,090
I'm out.

00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:30,050
And I appreciate that.
You're very much right.

00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:32,110
We're very early
in what we're trying to do.

00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:35,270
You've got two sharks left.

00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:38,290
Okay, I like this platform.

00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:40,060
I think your software side

00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,110
is probably the most compelling
thing to me

00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:44,150
because of your capacity
to use Bluetooth

00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:47,100
and actually broadcast
whatever you want to program

00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,130
into your application.

00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:52,030
But what I'm afraid of
is that you have a dependency

00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,160
on Apple because
you're iOS-only right now.

00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:58,040
I think your price point's
a little bit too high.

00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,120
I just can't get over
those hurdles.

00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,040
And so, for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,110
Okay. Great.
Thank you.

00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:09,050
See, to me, as this becomes
more multi-window

00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:12,030
and lock screen
becomes smarter,

00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:14,000
iOS is just gonna
keep on improving,

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,090
I don't think your product

00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:17,150
becomes as critical
or as compelling.

00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:19,190
And so, for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:23,090
Man, you did a very good job
today of explaining.

00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:24,170
No, I really, really
appreciate it.

00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:26,160
I know it's a new space, so we
have a lot of work ahead of us.

00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,130
But I thank you for your time.
It's been wonderful.

00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:30,030
-Thank you very much.
-Great. Thank you, guys.

00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:32,020
-Appreciate it. Thank you.
-Bye.

00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,130
You know,
I'm a little disappointed

00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:36,080
that I didn't get the money,
but the feedback was wonderful.

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,060
I think everybody
had really good ideas.

00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,180
It's a new space,
it's a new product,

00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:42,080
you know, I think we have
some things to figure out.

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,020
That's a damn
good-looking case.

00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,220
Oh, my God.

00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,020
My name is Steve Watts.

00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,120
And I'm his fiancée,
Angela Ferendo.

00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,060
We live in Monarch Beach,
California.

00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:03,080
And we are the founders
of Slyde Handboards.

00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,040
I grew up in South Africa.

00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:08,020
There's a huge surfing culture
over there.

00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,110
As kids, we used to use

00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:11,190
absolutely everything
to ride waves.

00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:15,070
A lot of people look up
to surfers and want to be one,

00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:18,040
but they don't have the time,
ability, or funds

00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,090
to be able to do it.

00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:22,040
Handboarding gives you
the thrill of surfing

00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,100
without all the hassle.

00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,260
Do they get a bicep leash,
as well?

00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,150
Um...yep.

00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:28,040
We're at a make-it-or-break-it
point for Slyde.

00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,120
We've racked up
credit-card debt

00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,180
and we've borrowed money
from friends and family.

00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:34,160
The biggest thing is we took
all of our wedding money

00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,060
that we had
and put it into the business.

00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,110
If we don't get an investment
from the Sharks,

00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:41,070
we won't be able
to get married,

00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:43,070
we won't be able to fund
our inventory.

00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:45,100
So, literally,
everything is riding on this.

00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,140
We believe if we get a Shark
on board,

00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:51,020
we can jump-start our business
and our life together.

00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,090
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Angela Ferendo.

00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:14,060
And this is my fiancé,
Steve Watts.

00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,200
We are co-owners
of Slyde Handboards.

00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,010
We are asking for $200,000
for 15% of our company.

00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:23,060
Watts:
So, when I was a little kid,

00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:26,090
my mom used to take us down
to beach for the day.

00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:30,050
And when we were down there,
we would literally try to find

00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:32,140
anything that we could ride
a wave with,

00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,050
from broken surfboards
to Frisbees,

00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:36,100
even our flip-flops.

00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:40,090
But our favorite
was the fast-food tray.

00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:43,180
It wasn't until I started
traveling around the world

00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:48,020
that I met other surfers
that did exactly the same thing.

00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:50,080
And that's why
I started Slyde.

00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,040
Wave-riding boards
that literally fit

00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,160
in the palm of your hand.

00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:58,050
Now we're gonna show you
a video so you can see

00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,180
sliders all over the world

00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:02,280
having fun
on their Slyde handboard.

00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,270
♪♪

00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:25,030
-Cool.
-So, who wants to join us

00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,170
in making Slyde
a global name brand?

00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:29,030
But before you answer
that question,

00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,260
we have some gifts
for you.

00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,100
Oh, cool.

00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,030
-They're very cool.
-Yeah.

00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,040
-Cool.
-Okay.

00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,060
So, you get your own
Slyde board.

00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,070
Carbon-fiber blue.

00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,110
Specially designed
out for you, Lori.

00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,030
Lori, this one's special
for you.

00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,030
Mr. Wonderful.

00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,120
Called carbon-fiber black.

00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,130
And it's another
special design.

00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,070
Little Mavs action.
I like it.

00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:48,000
-Thanks, guys.
-No problem.

00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,080
High five, bro.

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,090
How does it work?
I put it on.

00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:53,140
There's a strap to --

00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,130
As that wave's
coming towards you,

00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:57,190
you feel that power,
you put your hand out,

00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:00,150
and pretty much the board
does the rest of the work.

00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:03,030
As apart from
if you were bodysurfing,

00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:05,040
um, you know,
you just get that extra

00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,050
bit of control
going down the wave.

00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:08,150
How much does it cost?

00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:12,020
That one is $199 --
the carbon fiber.

00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:14,140
And then our average
is the $169.

00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:17,130
How many years
have you been doing this?

00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:20,050
We sold our first board
in 2011.

00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:24,280
We've sold $356,000
since we started.

00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,070
How about last year?

00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:28,030
Last year was $159,000.

00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,050
That's not a lot.

00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:32,010
What have you done
year to date?

00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,060
We've done
nearly $60,000.

00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:38,130
At the end of this year,
we should do $295,000.

00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:40,110
Angela, how much money
did you put in

00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,180
when you started
the business?

00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:44,120
We're supposed to get married
in September.

00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:49,130
My mom had $10,000 that
she saved up for our wedding.

00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:51,110
Actually, these boards
that you see in front of you,

00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,170
-we just got.
-This is our wedding.

00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:54,110
So, instead of the wedding,
you bought the boards?

00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:56,100
-Yeah.
-That's committing.

00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,150
So, I made an investment

00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:59,180
in a company called Handboards.
-Yes.

00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:02,110
And so one
of the distribution channels

00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:04,050
we spent a lot of time with

00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:06,160
was these independent,
very cool surf shops.

00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:10,100
We hired a rep,
we went to distribution...

00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,100
-Yeah.
-You know.

00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,140
-It's tough.
-Yeah.

00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:15,010
We're gonna be old and gray
by the time we make

00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:15,355
any real money doing that.

00:34:15,355 --> 00:34:20,020
Tell me your idea.
How do you blow this up quickly?

00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:22,110
So, our plan
is to focus first

00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:25,130
on those specialty surf --
surf stores.

00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:29,030
Why aren't you talking
to a Target, a Walmart?

00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:31,160
We have just recently
sent to Target.

00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:35,060
We are -- You know,
we have to educate first.

00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,100
O'Leary: Right.

00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,140
I mean, we need to put --

00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:40,030
We need the merchandising
to support the sales.

00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,120
People don't know
what it is.

00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,140
Greiner: Well, listen.

00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,150
I think it seems
like a lot of fun,

00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:48,040
but I don't think I'm probably
the right partner for you.

00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,020
Okay.

00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,060
And so, for that reason,
I'm out.

00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,110
-Okay. Thank you.
-Okay.

00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,130
Well, thank you so much.

00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:56,020
O'Leary:
Your numbers are small.

00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,080
They're small.

00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,170
I mean, you're just starting
your distribution journey.

00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:04,010
I admire that you, um,
took all of your wedding money

00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:06,070
and put it into inventory.

00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,110
It's what you got to do.

00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:09,290
That takes a certain
surfer attitude. I get it.

00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:10,140
But it's not for me.

00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:14,040
But I will tell you
one thing.

00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,080
I'm gonna disclose
something to you

00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,160
that's very important
for this moment.
Oh, no.

00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,040
I'm actually now licensed
to marry people.

00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,050
-[ Laughs ]
-Oh.

00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:22,040
And I'm willing to perform
your wedding

00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,130
right here
in the Shark Tank.

00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:26,060
And so, if you two are ready,
let's do it right now.

00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,290
You may not have a deal,
but you'll leave married.

00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:30,050
Which is just as good to me.

00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,100
Yeah. Um...

00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,260
I'm out, guys.
I'm out.

00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,120
Okay.

00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,130
Thank you very much.
We really appreciate it.

00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:39,090
How does your, um,
revenue break down?

00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:43,100
More higher-end,
athletic surfers or kids?

00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:48,210
We are 23- to 35-year-old,
mostly men.

00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:52,090
We also have a lot of
ambassadors that are the groms.

00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:54,190
They're the 13-year-olds
to 16-year-olds

00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:57,130
that are, like,
really pushing the sport.

00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:59,150
But that's my question,
really.

00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:02,080
The more athletic
you have to be,

00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,260
the higher end,
the smaller the market, right?

00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,130
Right.

00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,120
The more general --
So, if that was a picture

00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,070
of an 8-year-old with a smile
on a little wave,

00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:14,070
then, all of a sudden,
it becomes a surfer starter kit.

00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,130
Here's the other reason I ask.

00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:18,070
One of my "Shark Tank" companies
is Tower Paddle Board.

00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:19,080
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,180
And they came in doing $40,000
in sales.

00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:24,000
They'll do at least $8 million,
if not $10 million, this year.

00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,358
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:36:24,358 --> 00:36:26,100
They do not only stand-up
paddleboards,

00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,170
but they do surfboards,
as well.

00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:30,160
We're looking
for ancillary products, right?

00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,290
But if it's a very,
you know, niche product,

00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:35,070
that doesn't help them.

00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,220
Kutcher:
I think that this is, like,

00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:40,080
this sort of minimalist approach
to going and catching a wave.

00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,180
Absolutely. Yeah.
You got it.

00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:44,060
I've lugged a surfboard
out on the water,

00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,170
and it's a pain
and it's heavy.

00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,130
And sometimes
you're just out there

00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:50,020
and you want to just go
in the water really quick

00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,070
and grab something

00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:53,060
and then catch a couple waves
really, really fast.

00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,060
And I think this solves
that problem.

00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:57,180
I think the biggest trick is
the balance of,

00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:01,140
how do you get into those bigger
stores to get those sales

00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:04,270
to that broader audience
and keep your edge?

00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:05,130
Yeah.

00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:07,290
And that's all about
your brand, Slyde.

00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:08,160
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,120
I just think if you go
too wide too soon,

00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,280
there's a danger
it's not cool.

00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,190
Don't get me wrong.

00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,110
I'm not opposed to going wide
and making a lot of money.

00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:20,040
No, no. I want to go wide
and make a lot of money,

00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,200
but it's just --
It really is, I think,

00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,020
just about, uh, like, being
careful about how you do it.

00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:29,110
This is so not my space.
Okay?

00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:32,050
I'm from Iowa.
I'm like a farm kid, all right?

00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:34,140
I have zero experience

00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:37,050
in getting things like this
to market.

00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:38,220
Uh, I have a really,
really large

00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:42,110
online distribution channel
that can help market things

00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:44,110
and do it
with the right voice.

00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,160
So I would need a partner.

00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:48,060
And if Mark would be willing
to partner with me...

00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,150
-Absolutely.
-...on the deal...

00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:51,150
I could take it
into Tower Paddle Board.

00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:54,110
They have the infrastructure,
they have the media.

00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:57,050
You'd walk in
right into a huge customer base.

00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:59,150
I'd be willing
to do the deal $200,000

00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:03,030
for 25% of the company
and split it with him.

00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,050
-Yep.
-Okay.

00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:05,280
Okay.
Well, thank you.

00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,170
Thank you very much.

00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:09,050
What's your thought
on that offer?

00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:12,130
We don't really want to go
above 20%

00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:15,110
because this
is all we have.

00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:19,000
This is our future, this is --
We put everything in it.

00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,090
And now you have help.

00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:25,040
Mark's idea
about distribution online...

00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,010
Yep.

00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,040
...we have a pipeline

00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,070
that we can market this to
online, right?

00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:31,080
You're actually doing
direct consumer marketing.

00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,100
We can target demographics
on Facebook.

00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,050
I mean, I can target
like right down to the age range

00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:37,100
that you'd want to nail --

00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,150
-Your groms...
-Yeah.

00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:40,160
...I can nail them,
like, direct on.

00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,160
And I can help you build out
a Facebook marketing strategy

00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,110
on your online retail
in a way that nobody can do.

00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:49,050
If you walk away,
you're gonna think to yourself,

00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:51,270
"Golly, that 5%,
was it really that important?"

00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,140
Narrator:
Two sharks are out.

00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:07,120
Steve and Angela
have one offer on the table --

00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,130
$200,000 for 25%
from Mark and Ashton

00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:13,140
for their handboard company,
Slyde.

00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:17,200
We don't really want to go
above 20%.

00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,080
If you walk away,
you're gonna think to yourself,

00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:23,250
"Golly, that 5%,
was it really that important?"

00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,200
Do you want to hear
if he has an offer or not?

00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,010
In life, sometimes looking
at options is not a bad idea.

00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:31,040
We're talking about 5%.

00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,090
We know.
We understand.

00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:34,230
Robert, are you there at 20%?
That's the question.

00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:39,030
I've made a lot of mistakes
with Handboards.

00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:40,180
We've painfully learned
the market.

00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,140
You've got to build
with the right stores,

00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:46,160
you've got to be authentic,
and then you go wide.

00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,010
He hasn't learned
from his mistakes.

00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:49,355
-When we --
-5% --

00:39:49,355 --> 00:39:52,110
-Let's hear his offer.
-5% is a lot to give up,

00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:55,080
because over time, it's gonna
be worth a lot of money.

00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,190
This is cool
'cause you're cool.

00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:58,140
Ashton,
let him get his offer out.
This is cool.

00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,060
Why would I want him
to get his offer out?

00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:03,290
Your counter
was $200,000 for 20%.

00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:05,000
Mm-hmm.

00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:11,030
Okay, guys, while he's deciding,
let me just say this.

00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,030
It's not about 5%.

00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,130
You're getting
Tower Paddle Board,

00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:16,020
you're getting me,
and you're getting Ashton.

00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,090
And you're arguing
about 5%?

00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:19,070
You keep saying
let him get his offer out,

00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:20,180
but he keeps ho-humming
on his offer.

00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:23,010
I just don't think
this is an add-on product

00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:23,365
to Tower Paddle Boards.

00:40:23,365 --> 00:40:25,180
-It's not an add-on product.
-It's a key product.

00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:28,050
-It's not an add-on product.
-Exactly. Thank you.

00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,140
Slyde is a product
in and of itself.

00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:33,080
But why not use the resources
of an existing asset...

00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,020
That has the distribution.

00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:37,050
We're one of 20 partners
on Amazon

00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:38,170
that get front-page

00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:41,080
You're not saying
that we have to do that, right?

00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,060
No.
You'll have your choice, right?

00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,090
It's your call.

00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:45,170

can get the sales support.

really frustrating.

for you.

the $200,000 for 15%.

that having more than one Shark
means a lot.

if you will do 20%,

00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:37,150
you have a deal.
