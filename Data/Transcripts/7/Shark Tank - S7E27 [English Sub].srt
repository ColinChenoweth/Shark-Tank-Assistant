00:00:01,097 --> 00:00:02,177
Narrator:
This is the Shark Tank,

00:00:02,177 --> 00:00:05,060
where entrepreneurs
seek an investment

00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,100
to start, grow, or save
their businesses.

00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,140
Sharks,
meet the Spooner.

00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,050
Who's ready
for a little sugar?

00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,010
Narrator: If the Sharks
hear a great idea...

00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,050
That's the American dream!

00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,120
Narrator: ...they'll invest
their own money...

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,050
You need a strategic partner.

00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,130
What you need is capital.

00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,060
Narrator: ...and fight
each other for a deal.

00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,110
I'm gonna put an offer
on the table,

00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:22,160
but you have to get
the other half.

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,070
I'm interested
in partnering with her, but --

00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,120
Except for him.

00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,080
Narrator: The entrepreneurs
must get the full amount

00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,170
they're asking for, or they'll
walk away with nothing.

00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,120
I mean, people are
addicted to this stuff.

00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,070
This isn't the best
that you're gonna do.

00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,040
Lieu: My family escaped
the Vietnam War.

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,040
I'm gonna create success
no matter what.

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,060
You bring a shareholder.

00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,100
That's a whole different
ballgame.

00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,130
No, not with
the right shareholder.

00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,170
You sh-- I don't need
your opinion, Barbara.

00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,240
Kevin, can you leave?
You're making the children cry.

00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,280
Narrator:
Who are the Sharks?

00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:53,080
They're self-made
business experts worth billions.

00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,080
Kevin O'Leary is
a shrewd venture capitalist

00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,180
who made his fortune

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,010
selling a children's
educational company

00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,200
for over $4 billion.

00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,220
Barbara Corcoran went
from waiting tables in Manhattan

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,240
to building the city's premier
$2 billion real-estate empire.

00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,050
Robert Herjavec, son of
an immigrant factory worker,

00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,100
founded one of

00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,100
the world's preeminent
cyber-security firms.

00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,150
Lori Greiner, the Queen of QVC,
holds over 100 patents

00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,190
and has launched
more than 400 products,

00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,130
grossing over a half a billion
dollars in sales.

00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:33,040
And Mark Cuban,
esteemed billionaire tech mogul

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,040
and the outspoken owner
of the Dallas mavericks.

00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,160
First into the Tank

00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,230
is a healthier version
of a favorite treat.

00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,040
Hello.
My name is Heather Saffer.

00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,150
I'm from Rochester, New York.

00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:05,030
I'm seeking $75,000
for 20% equity

00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,170
in my company,
Dollop Gourmet,

00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,100
the first healthier
and tastier answer

00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,030
to one of the scariest
processed foods

00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,110
on the planet -- frosting.

00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,090
Who doesn't love frosting?

00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,110
It's so sinfully decadent.

00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,110
But the problem with
store-bought shelves'
table frostings

00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,090
is that they're horrible
for you,

00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,120
laden with chemicals,
artificial food dyes,

00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,080
some even contain animal lard.

00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,080
Who wants to put that
on their cake?

00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,000
Dollop Gourmet frosting
is better for you

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,180
and tastes incredible.

00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:41,130
Dollop is non-GMO, gluten free,
vegan, and 100% all natural.

00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,060
It even contains
half as much sugar.

00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,010
Sharks, I need your help.

00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,080
Who's ready
for a little sugar?

00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,050
[ Chuckles ]

00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,100
-Yeah?
-Bring it.

00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,040
-I have some samples for you.
-I'm a frosting freak.

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,080
You get the redless
velvet cupcake.

00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,050
Ooh. Thank you.

00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,130
Thank you.
Very nice presentation.

00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,100
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,080
Saffer: And then, Mark,
you got vanilla.

00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,060
Cuban: That works.

00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,090
-Hi, Lori.
-Hi, Robert!

00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,130
How are things
on the "Shark Tank"?

00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:07,050
Saffer: So, the cupcake
is our vanilla frosting.

00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,080
We use pure
Madagascar bourbon vanilla,

00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,280
the highest-quality vanilla.

00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,170
And then, next to that,

00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,090
you have the peanut butter
cookie dough frosting.

00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,070
There's the sea salted
caramel frosting.

00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,140
And then, lastly, you have
the hot chocolate frosting.

00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,040
Stuff tastes great.
What's in it?
Thank you.

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,050
Mmm.

00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,160
We use organic
sustainable palm oil.

00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,040
We use organic cane sugar,
and half as much.

00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,090
What's
the shelf life?

00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,020
It's a year, unopened.

00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,080
How are you
selling it now?

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,170
We're selling it
in retail stores.

00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,090
So, I launched the company
less than a year ago

00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,280
in all 85
Wegmans locations.

00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,140
A couple months ago --

00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,120
-That is a great store.
-It is.

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,160
We got into all 215 Meijers
stores in the midwest.

00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,060
Next month, we'll be launching
in two Whole Foods regions...

00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,040
Wow.

00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,100
...and in 152 HEB stores.

00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,080
How did you get into
the frosting business?

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,070
So, in 2009, I was working
at a car dealership.

00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,090
It was probably
my 30th job.

00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,170
I hadn't finished college.

00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,180
I decided that
I wanted to start a business,

00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,000
and I saw that cupcakes
were becoming popular back then.

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,338
No kidding.

00:04:04,338 --> 00:04:06,050
Who's got the number-one
cupcake?

00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,120
Right here!
-I know! I know!

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,160
And so I decided I would attend
the school of Google and YouTube

00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,130
and teach myself how to bake,
so I'm a self-taught baker.

00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:16,080
I opened a bakery in Rochester

00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,120
and aligned myself
with the wrong people,

00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,040
and I lost everything.

00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,090
Oh.

00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:24,020
Um, I had to pay off my debts
and dissolve the company.

00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,070
It was by a different name.

00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,080
How much money did you lose
in that first bakery venture?

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,160
Probably about $20,000.

00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,090
-Wow.
-That was my life savings.

00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:34,120
Within three weeks,
I said I wasn't gonna stop.

00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,140
I started a new bakery.
Everyone said I couldn't do it.

00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,010
Corcoran:
Where did you get the cash?

00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,090
I borrowed $4,000
from my parents.

00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,060
That bakery became
really successful.

00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,070
I won Food Network's
"Cupcake Wars."

00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,120
I was gonna say
I recognize you.

00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,290
-Do you really?
-Yes.

00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,030
What are sales now?

00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,020
We've done $170,000
since November.

00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,070
This year, what do you think
you'll do?

00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,070
About another $50,000.

00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,040
$200,000 for the year,
you think?

00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,090
Yeah. Approximately,
a little bit more.

00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,020
What are your margins
on this product?

00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,090
The margin's 40%.

00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,280
I make it in Wisconsin.
I have a co-packer.

00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,130
I make it for $2.30.

00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,100
That sounds
a little high.

00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,120
Which is the most expensive
ingredient in here?

00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,030
The palm oil's
really expensive.

00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,150
The jars are also expensive.

00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,030
What is Wegmans
selling each jar for?

00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,030
Wegmans sells each jar
for $6.99.

00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,090
And how does that
compare with

00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,290
the leading category killer,
and you know which one I mean.

00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,120
Yes, I do.

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,270
What do they
sell theirs for?

00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,160
They sell about $1.50.

00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,080
-That's -- wow.
-Really?
-Huge issue.

00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,270
Saffer: It's a --
It's a lot higher.

00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,140
Corcoran: Wow.

00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,230
We're also selling
on Amazon for $12.99.

00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,090
What?!

00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,050
Cuban: It sells for $6.99
in the stores,

00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,160
and $12.99 on Amazon?

00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,130
Yes, but we haven't
had any complaints.

00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,180
Herjavec:
Is that a problem?

00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,050
Nope. We haven't had
any complaints about price.

00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,060
People are paying for it.

00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,170
The formula that won
in "Cupcake Wars,"

00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:49,110
is it the same formula
that we have here?
It is not.

00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,160
I actually wrote a cookbook --
"The Dollop Book of Frosting".

00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,110
Herjavec: And you wrote
a cookbook in your spare time!

00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,130
I wrote a cookbook,
yep.

00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,110
I researched
how to write a cookbook

00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:58,060
and actually found
an agent,

00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,060
got a book deal
with a publisher.

00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,260
Do you have a pilot's license
and a PhD?

00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,120
I don't!

00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,180
So, which was the frosting
that won?

00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,070
So, the frosting's are
in the cookbook that won, so --

00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,070
Greiner: Okay.

00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,030
Is it the same formula
that's in these,

00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,100
or did you change it?

00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,050
Saffer: Nope. I changed it
'cause they were butter-based,

00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,290
and I really wanted
to create something

00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,050
that everyone could enjoy.

00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,280
So I wanted it to be
gluten-free, vegan,

00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,140
dairy-free, soy-free.

00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,070
It's something
that everyone can eat

00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,090
because it's allergen friendly,

00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,170
and that's a huge craze
right now.

00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:27,040
Herjavec: Heather, let me --
let me tell you where I'm at.

00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,140
First of all,
very impressive.

00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:31,290
You are the definition
of "don't know when to quit."

00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,060
Thank you.

00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,030
It's not how many times
you fall down,

00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,120
it's how many times
you get up.

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,110
I don't like frosting.
Cuban: [ Chuckles ]

00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,000
Like, I --
I just -- I just don't.

00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,050
Really?
Yeah.

00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,100
Not so crazy
about the product.

00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,040
You got to be passionate
about the product, so...

00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,240
Saffer: Yes.
...love you.

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,020
I'm out.

00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,120
I appreciate it.

Let me get the ball rolling --

00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,150
I have a huge database
of people that buy cupcakes.

I am the number-one cupcake
FedEx'd in America toady.

So I would like
to go to that database,

cut a deal with Wicked,

00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,240
and make this part of our
product line with your brand.

00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,100
Okay.

00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,030
How is your partner
gonna feel about that,

00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,080
that you're bringing
in a competitor?

00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,050
I think if -- if --
No, this is icing.

00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,070
But your cupcakes
have icing.

to the supplemental market

the actual baked goods

You're very greedy,

No, it's not
greedy at all,

because I would develop
your business

in the same way
I developed Daisy Cakes,

from $25,000,

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,080

to $4 million, okay?

extending an offer to me.

My problem with it
is I don't think

The reason
I want the extra equity

00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:06,260
A deal with the Sharks would
make all of my dreams come true.

00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,290
Aloha!

00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,130
[ Laughs ]

00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,090
Sharks,
my name is Mai Lieu.

00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:34,110
I'm from Honolulu, Hawaii,
and my company -- CreaProducts.

00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:38,000
And I'm seeking $200,000
for 10% of my company.

00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,130
Growing up, we couldn't afford
to go to the salon,

00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,100
so my mom would always
cut my hair at home.

00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:49,070
And my bangs would end up
way too short and uneven.

00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,160
I'm sure many kids and parents
can relate.

00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:56,090
And, ladies, what about those
pinot grigio bangs?

00:14:56,090 --> 00:15:00,040
You know, after you've had
a couple glasses of wine,

00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,030
and you decide
to cut your own hair?

00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,030
[ Laughter ]

00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,040
Herjavec:
Does that happen?

00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,170
No, I don't think.

00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,050
-I do it all the time.
-Well, there's no more excuses.

00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:11,040
Introducing the CreaClip.

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,160
It's a hair-cutting guide

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,130
that allows you
to cut your hair at home,

00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:18,020
and get a perfect cut --
great for cutting kids' hair,

00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,170
bangs, and layers.

00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:23,110
First, I'm gonna show you
how I cut my bangs.

00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:30,040
You just gather all your bangs,
slide, and you just trim.

00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,000
So I'm just trimming off
all the split ends.

00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:39,000
This is gonna create
perfect bangs.

00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,070
Done. Beautiful bangs.
-Oh!

00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:44,140
So I have a larger size,
a large curved CreaClip.

00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,100
This is gonna create layers,
and it's really easy.

00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,040
I want to show you next...

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,250
Can you
demonstrate on Lori?

00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,140
[ Laughs ]

00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,130
I don't want to mess up
her beautiful hair.

00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:58,010
You just
flip your head over...

00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,060
clip the CreaClip...

00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,150
Now this is the best part --
it has a built-in level.

00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:08,070
That's how you know
it's perfectly balanced.

00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,270
And we're going to trim!
[ Laughs ]

00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,160
-No!
-Yes!

00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,180
I'm gonna cut
all this hair!
Wow.

00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,070
I surf a lot,
so I got a lot of split ends.

00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:18,290
So, this is gonna cut --
get rid of all the split ends

00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,080
and create beautiful layers.

00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,000
Are you seeing
the level?

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,378
Yeah. Yeah.

00:16:22,378 --> 00:16:24,240
You can see. You hold it up,
and you just cut.

00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,270
Sharks, are you ready?

00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,020
We're ready.

00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,050
Done!

00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,040

beautiful...

-Wow.

00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,080
...beautiful layers.

00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,160
And it creates a beautiful
layer shape in the back.

00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:42,110
Now, Sharks, who wants to cut
a deal with CreaProducts?

00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,280
I have some samples for you.

00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,230
So...
Oh!
There's CreaNails?

00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,080
Yes.

00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,190
So this one...

00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:54,280
That's the CreaClip.
I have the CreaNails for nails.

00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,170
What is this?

00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:58,260
This is for makeup, and I'll
definitely show you that.

is the same investment?

Yes.
It's all included.

00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,080
Mai, how -- how many CreaClips
have you sold

00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,050

dollar-wise?

00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,020
Uh, in the last year?

00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,100
-Just the CreaClips.
-You're kidding.

00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,030
O'Leary: Is that your
number-one product?

00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,040
That's my
number-one product.

00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,050
What about the other products
all together?

Well, the other products,
they're new.

Mai Lieu, do you demonstrate
it online?

00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,090
Do you actually show people
how to do it?

00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,150
You know how --
how people find me?

00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,070
They see my videos
on YouTube.

00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,090
Really?
So that's the driver.

00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,100
So, I do instructional videos
on YouTube.

do you have on YouTube?

I have 20 million views,

00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:37,090
and just last month,
my video went viral

00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:40,030
and 500,000 people
shared it,

00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,110
and I sold out of product.

00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:43,170
I sold 150,000 that week.

00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,170
I don't think you mentioned
what you sell one for.

00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:50,070
So, my CreaClip --
online I sell this for $30.

00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,040
My CreaNails --
$24.95 plus shipping.

00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:58,060
And my CreaLash -- $24.95.

So, what is --
what is that CreaLash,

00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:02,080
and how do you use it?

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,130
Y-Y-You do this,
and you apply the shadow

00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,100
so it doesn't fall
on your skin.

00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,120
Also, it works great
for mascara.

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,200
You -- it lifts the lid,
apply the makeup,

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,170
and it actually bends
the lashes, creating more curl,

00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:20,110
and you get the -- You don't get
mascara on your skin.

00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:22,060

Mai?

00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,110

industry for 20 years.

As a hair cutter,
a hair stylist?

00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,130
Yes. A hair stylist.

00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:30,180
When I was four, my family
escaped the Vietnam War.

00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,240
It was a hard time.
We didn't have any money.

[ Voice breaking ]
Um, my mom worked at McDonalds,
my dad worked night shift.

00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,110
So I said, "when I grow up,

00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,160
I'm gonna create success
no matter what.

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,080

of my parents."

I've created all these products,

I-I want to continue to do that.

00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:52,010
Your dream was to make money,
take care of your parents.

Have you been able
to make money

out of the $550,000
in sales?
Yes.

Yes, uh, my profit margin
is 66%, and I make $155,000.

with your story

00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,220
about escaping communism.

00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,100

one thing I know.

People always
say this to me --

"Why do you have such
a chip on your shoulder?"

00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,110
And I always say,

00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:20,010
"Because of where I came from,
I had no choice."

00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,060
I had to be successful

00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,110
to justify
my parents' sacrifice for me.

Anything I do
for the rest of my life

as what my dad did for me

ever.

one day off.

their own bangs,

a little differently.

That was Barb's offer.

You know, there's no better
motivation for an entrepreneur

00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:11,030
than trying to prove something,
and that's what you've got.

But I have to say,

00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,050
I think this product doesn't
have room for an investor.

I can't envision how I can make
money on this thing.

I don't like you,

that you are a go-getter.

But this year, I'm gonna
be making $800,000 in sales,

this year alone.

00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:51,080
I know, but I feel like
there's some engineering work

00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,090

You know,
the funny thing about retail,

00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,050
one of the things they measure,
is sales per square foot.

00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:54,090
So if you can sell
a lot of stuff

00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:56,170
with the smallest amount
of footprint,

00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:59,110
that's what big retailers
get really excited about.

00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:02,190
This, combined with this,
could be a good business,

00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:04,110
like, a really good business
that you could take wide.

00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:07,080
-[ Normal voice ] Yeah, Exactly.
-Right?

00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,080
Look, I love you guys.

00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,160
You -- You --
You make me feel bad

00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,100
that I haven't done enough
with my life, because you're --

00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,080
you're so far ahead.
[ Laughter ]

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,070
But i-it's not for me.

00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:20,030
Great job,
but I'm not your Shark.

00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,000
I'm out.

00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:25,150
This is a great company,
but this isn't the best

00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:27,070
that you're
gonna be able to do.

00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:29,080
You'll reach a point where
you say, "You know what?

00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,160
This was
a great starter kit."

00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,050
Well, I think
this is gonna be my future,

00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:35,150
because I want
to be the next Pandora, okay?

00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,160
I mean, you go to Disney,
you've seen Pandora,

00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,090
and everybody's
surrounded by it,

00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:41,070
'cause there's
all these Disney charms.

00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:44,150
And I want to go into Disney
and see Yourself Expression

00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,280
and all the Poppers
with the characters,

00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,090
and see people swarming.

00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:50,260
I mean, people are addicted
this -- to this stuff.

00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,130
They love it!

00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:54,050
Look, I like it.
I-I think the product's great.

00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:55,130
But I truly believe

00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:57,100
you'll find bigger
and better things to do.

00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,140
And Gordy will take over,

00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,160
he'll find bigger and better
things to do.

00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,110
I just don't want you to have
the pressure of saying --

00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:05,110
okay, now that you've taken
money --

00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:07,140
because I-I think
people fail to realize

00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:10,130
your obligations change,
you know?

00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:12,140
It's not just about
growing the business,

00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,290
it's also about
supporting the investor,

00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:16,260
dealing with the investors.

00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,190
I'm out.

00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,160
You know,
I was listening to you,

00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,070
and you remind me of a saying
I have that I love,

00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:29,070
which is, "It isn't
'Who's going to let me?'

00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:31,060
It's 'Who's
going to stop me?'"

00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,030
You have
that drive in you.

00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:35,270
Right now,
you're so successful that,

00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,130
actually, as a Shark,

00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:39,060
I might complicate things
for you.

00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:42,000
I wish you the best of luck.
I'm out.

00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,150
Thank you. [ Sniffles ]

00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:51,020
Gordy, before you go,
ask your sister for more equity.

00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,090
[ Laughter ]

00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:53,070
Congratulations, guys.

00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,080
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,020
It's beautiful jewelry.

00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:00,040
Shelby:
I was disappointed 'cause
they didn't really get it,

00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,060
the sports
and the characters

00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,070
and the -- the big process
we could have for this,

00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:08,060
but I realize I got a lot
of great advice from them

00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:11,190
in that -- you're gonna see me
in a few years, I guess.

00:31:20,437 --> 00:31:21,377
Narrator:
Next into the Tank

00:31:21,377 --> 00:31:25,170
is a toy that combines
the fun of skating and surfing.

00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,030
Hi.
I'm Randy Putland.

00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,080
My name's
Bernie Miller.

00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,120
I'm Reuben Guymer.

00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,160
We're all from San Diego,
and we are the Spooner guys.

00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:44,010
We're seeking $400,000
for 16% of our company.

00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:46,060
Sharks, meet the Spooner.

00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,160
It is the ultimate
board trainer

00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:51,010
for simulating surf,
skate, and snowboard moves

00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,070
on any surface.

00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:55,050
You can ride it,
slide it, flip it, spin it.

00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:57,080
Kids love them.
They just jump on it

00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,210
and immediately start developing
their balance and coordination

00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:02,120
while making up their own tricks
and having fun at it.

00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,090
Speaking of tricks, we have
a real treat for you Sharks.
We do.

00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,150
He's nationally
and internationally known

00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:08,070
as the hardest-working man
on the Spooner,

00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:11,010
Master Spooner, Mr. Spooner,
the Star of the Spooner,

00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:11,346
Reuben Guymer!

00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:12,290
Get him, Reub!

00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:15,250
Nice, nice!
There it is!

00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,110
[ Laughs ]

00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:18,050
Nice!
Watch out! Watch out!

00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,020
[ Laughter ]

00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,000
Oh, my -- oh, my God!

00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,030
Hold on, hold on,
hold on!

00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,100
[ Laughter ]

00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,060
Get him some water.
We'll be all right.

00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,060
What?

00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,040
Wait a minute.
I'm not done, man!

00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,030
I got to ride the Yardboard!

00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:33,020
Miller:
Hey, helmet!

00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:35,391
The Yardboard.

00:32:35,391 --> 00:32:37,090
Guymer:
So this is a Yardboard.

00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:39,080
It's a all-terrain
downhill slider.

00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,020
The snow's the best,
but I like to ride these ramps,

00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,120
grass, dirt -- dirt, snow.

00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,280
Here we go!
Putland: Get it!

00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,230
Yeah! Nice!

00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:49,250
Whoo!

00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,060
[ Laughter ]

00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,050
Herjavec: Cool.

00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,130
[ Laughter ]
-Thank you.

00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:56,110
Sharks, with our boards,
kids as young as three years old

00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:59,080
can start dreaming of becoming
a true boarder some day,

00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,100
starting
right in their own bedroom.

00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,090
And, Sharks, you know,
when we're out in the surf,

00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:05,050
we usually like to stay away
from you guys,

00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:07,090
but today we're willing
to make an exception,

00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:10,070
so who wants to jump on board
the Spooner team?

00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:12,060
We've got some boards
for these guys.

00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,000
-Cool, thank you.
-Robert.

00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,080
-Lori.
-Thank you.

00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,060
-Mr. Wonderful.
-Thank you, thank you.

00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,160
So it's simulating, like,
riding a wave

00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:23,170
or -- or going down a ski slope?
Exactly. Yeah.

00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,120
O'Leary: Okay.
Tell us about the business.

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,170
Yes, It's a funny story.
I have a small surf shop.

00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:32,000
I bought a dog igloo,
plastic dog igloo.

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,080
So I picked up my saw,

00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,170
and I started
cutting this dog igloo,

00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:38,090
and I said, "Man,
there's a skateboard deck."

00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:41,060
So I make six of them,
just hand did them,

00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,140
and I put wheels on them,

00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,100
but they hit the ground,
they didn't work.

00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,110
So they were just
laying like this

00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:48,090
the whole time
in the back of the surf shop.

00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:50,060
But kids just started
getting on them

00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,020
and playing
and spinning and jumping.

00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,090
Okay.
So then what happens?

00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:55,030
You start realizing
kids want them?

00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,040
Well --
Well, we went --

00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,070
Cuban: Surf --
you have a surf shop, right?

00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,090
So you have a place
to sell them.

00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:00,140
We did $52,000.

00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,100
We sold 1,100 boards
in 6 weeks.

00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,150
Was that Christmas season?

00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,180
Yes.
It was the Christmas --
yeah. Absolutely.

00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,070
O'Leary: Were you demonstrating
the boards?

00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:09,000
How do people know
what to do with them

00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,030
when they just look at them?

00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,150
We had, like 50 boards
out all around the kiosk.

00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,100
-Wow.
-And you were demonstrating it?

00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,100
We demoed, yeah.

00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,190
What was the cost
for one board?

00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:18,140
It was $45 for the small one
and $55 for the large one.

00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:22,040
This is the Pro model
and you're on the Freestyle.

00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,050
It's just
a little bit smaller --

00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,060
This is $45?

00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,060
-This is the small?
-Yes, sir. Yes.

00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,070
Corcoran:
And what does it cost you

00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:28,120
to make the $45 one
and the $55 one?

00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,150
It's about $12
and $12.50.

00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,270
O'Leary:
Those are good margins.
Those are good margins.

00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,150
Yeah. I'd say.

00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:35,110
At what volume are you
running those at today?

00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:38,100
Last year,
we did $1.73 million

00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:42,060
and this year we're on line
to do about $1.8 million.

00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,090
Whoa.

00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:45,140
And how are you selling
most of these, online?

00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:47,060
Guymer:
65% of our business

00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,190
is specialty retail stores,
toy stores.

00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:53,000
There's about 1,200
really good ones that we're in.

00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,335
That's our bread and butter,

00:34:53,335 --> 00:34:55,120
'cause little kids
get on this board,

00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,070
and as soon as they're on it,
they just immediately engage.

00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:00,110
Randall, how did you go
to $1.7 million?

00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:04,000
We really opened up
at the New York Toy Fair.

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,030
We got a huge booth.
2,000 --

00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,160
This display is great.

00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,040
So, is -- was that
your display at the toy show?

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,060
-Yes.
-We had a lot bigger one.

00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,120
We had a big one.
We have a 30-foot one.

00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:15,100
We started out
because we couldn't afford

00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,050
to go to,
uh, the toy fair,

00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,140
'cause it's
a lot of money to go.

00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:22,020
We started out in the
physical education programs

00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,040
all across the U.S.

00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,150
We would sell 130 boards
at a normal school show,

00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:29,080
and that would be enough
to pay the rent.

00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,020
Oh, we're in over 15,000
elementary P.E. programs.

00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,090
Where do you make these?

00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,010
We make them
in San Diego.

00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,090
We're made in America,
100%.

00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:37,160
Do you pay yourselves
something?

00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:41,150
We have a $60,000
a year salary for each of us.

00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:44,140
From $1.8 million,
including your salaries,

00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,280
what will the business
make as a profit?

00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,170
We made about $400,000.

00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:50,030
Oh, you guys
are making great money.

00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,120
Good for you, guys.
Congrats.
Yeah.

00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,110
There's no debt
on the business?
Putland: There's no debt.

00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,020
There's no
other shareholders?

00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,090
No. Just the three of us.

00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:58,120
Randall, what's the problem?
[ Laughter ]

00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,290
-What do you need the money for?
-Then what do you need us for?

00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:03,110
What's missing?

00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:05,030
Here's the --
You guys are missing!

00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:07,010
We want you guys
to get on board!

00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:08,140
But how would you use
the $400,000?

00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,180
Doesn't sound like
you need it.

00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,110
Well, you know, we've -- we've
stayed in our little niche,

00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:14,050
which is
the specialty toy market.

00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:15,270
We haven't really
branched out.

00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,150
The New York Toy Fair,

00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:18,150
where you went,
is not a specialty show.

00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:20,130
Every major retailer
goes there.

00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:23,050
Herjavec: There must have been
a big box retailer

00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:25,030
that tried
to bring you in.

00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,110
I-It was Toys"R"Us.

00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,210
All: And what happened?

00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:30,270
The thing is that we have
some fear going to the big box.

00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:31,150
Why?

00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:34,080
Because it takes
a lot of money to put that out.

00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,060
You didn't do it
because you were concerned

00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,070
to be
overextending yourself.

00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,080
Exactly.

00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,010
How do you guys
manage the business?

00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:42,080
What do each of you do?

00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,170
We're kind of unique
because we wear a lot of hats.

00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:47,100
We manufacture
right in our own warehouse,

00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:50,130
and we distribute
in our own warehouse, also.

00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:52,110
Bernie runs
all the manufacturing.

00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:55,020
Reuben is the sales
and marketing director.

00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,130
I run the numbers.
I'm the CFO.

00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:59,100
I love the whole story.
I love your distribution.

00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,070
The schools -- You have
a fantastic business.

00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,110
You make money.

00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:05,150
You're doing
what you love to do,

00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:09,290
and you get to work with people
that are fun and you love.

00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:11,100
That's the American dream.

00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,120
But here's the problem --

00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,170
you bring an investor in,
any of us,

00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:18,050
it just becomes
a different ballgame.

00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:20,100
When you bring in
outside money,

00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,090
there's a level
of discipline,

00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:24,130
because it's not yours
anymore.

00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:27,290
And is that something
that you want to do?

00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:32,010
Cuban: Basically, it means
changing your lifestyle.

00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:33,120
I-I'll give you
the perfect example.

00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,150
There's a company that came on
here, "SURFSET Fitness."

00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:38,030
We went out,
and sales started going like

00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:40,040
this, this, this,
this, this, this, this.

00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,090
But the amount of effort,

00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:43,130
the amount of time
that they had to put in

00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:45,070
started going up
even faster.

00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:47,030
And it got to the point --
Mike and Sarah

00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,060
got to the point,
were like,

00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,260
"We don't have
our lives anymore.

00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,160
We're not who we were."

00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,070
They paid us back all of
our money, plus a return.

00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,120
We still keep our equity.

00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,110
Now they do it
at their own leisurely pace.

00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:59,130
They weren't ready
to make that step.

00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:01,200
I don't think you guys are ready
to make that lifestyle change.

00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,060
While you're thinking about
all the spooky stuff

00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,080
that Mark's talking about,

00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,020
I'm gonna put an offer
on the table.

00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,180
Wow.

00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,210
Narrator:
All Sharks are still in,

00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:23,090
and Barbara has an offer coming
for Reuben, Randy, and Bernie's

00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:25,160
recreational board, Spooner.

00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,060
Cuban:
I don't think you guys are ready
to make that lifestyle change.

00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:30,120
While you're thinking about
all the spooky stuff

00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,130
that Mark's talking about,

00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:33,190
I'm gonna put an offer
on the table.

00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,150
Wow.

00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:39,250
I'm gonna give you
half the money --

00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,160
$200,000 for 8%,

00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,000
but you have to get the other
Shark in for the balance.

00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,348
All right?
Okay.

00:38:43,348 --> 00:38:44,210
We --
That sounds great, Barbara.

00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:47,120
Corcoran: But let me tell you
why I think you are ready.

00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,150
When you declined to go ahead
with a big box store,

00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:51,080
you did it for
the right business reasons.

00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,110
That was
the right move.

00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:55,100
You didn't have the cash
to put out or to cover it.

00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,050
I mean, of course
you made a good judgment.

00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:59,060
You've built your business
little by little.

00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,170
There's my half offer...
Wow.

00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:02,120
...but you have to get
the other half.

00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,220
We love that, Barbara.
Thank you so much.

00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,110
O'Leary:
All right, guys, look,

00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:12,000
I'm interested
in partnering with her,

00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,030
but I don't get up for 8%.

00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:16,040
I'm not interested.
Except for him.

00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,100
Any other Shark
other than he.

00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,060
All right, then I'll take
the whole deal myself.

00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,140
I'd structure the deal
a little differently.

00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,290
I don't think
you should sell your equity,

00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:23,180
and I'll tell you why.

00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:26,090
You guys have had a relationship
for many years together.

00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:28,030
It's like a family.

00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,070
You bring a shareholder,

00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:30,080
that's a whole
different ball game.

00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,120
No, not with
the right shareholder.

00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,150
I don't need your opinion,
Barbara.

00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:34,050
It doesn't matter to me.
I'm giving it anyway.

00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:35,110
What I'm gonna tell you
is this --
Barbara.

00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:39,010
What you need is capital
to fund this growth.

00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:39,388
You need a banker

00:39:39,388 --> 00:39:42,020
that basically believes
you can pay him back.

00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,110
So here's
what I would do --

00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:47,270
I would give you the $400,000
in tranches,

00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:49,090
$100,000 at a time.

00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:52,060
I'm gonna ask you
to pay me back at $2 a board.

00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,060
I want to at least
get a return on my money,

00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,110
as any banker would.

00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:57,150
So, for example,
I give you the $400,000,

00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:02,160
I want $800,000 back
at $2 a board.

00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,160
If somebody buys the company,
I'd like 3% as an option,

00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,040
but I don't have
any voting rights at all.

00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,070
In other words,
you guys run the business.

00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,100
Corcoran:
How complicated.

00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,070
Would you like to call
your accountant on this?

00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:16,060
Pretty simple, actually.
It's very simple.

00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,070
It's actually a way
for you to keep your business

00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:20,060
because what works
for you guys

00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,080
is the culture
you've built and the trust

00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,010
you have in each other
over all that time.

00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:26,120
You don't need
a shareholder.

00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,180
You don't want
a shareholder.

00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,090
Herjavec: Well, the advantage
of that deal, actually,

00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:31,060
is he's not a shareholder.

00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:34,160
But he's got to get paid.
He's the Grim Reaper.

00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,110
O'Leary: Any banker
has to get paid back.

00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:38,020
You can call a banker
anything you'd like.

00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,040
They got to get a return.

00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,170
Do you feel like
that's quite a high interest?

00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:44,120
[ Laughter ]
Well, it's gonna take me almost
five years to get it back.

00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,080
Greiner: But you were saying
you're not really looking

00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,070
for the cash necessarily.

00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:50,290
-We're looking for --
-You need a strategic partner.

00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:51,170
Yes.

00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:54,090
Listen, guys, I've talked Mark
into the deal.

00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:57,060
He'll take the other half
of the deal...
Really? Nice!

00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,150
...which is the 8%
at the same valuation, $200,000.

00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:02,050
And here's why I said yes,
because Tower Paddle Boards --

00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:03,130
stand-up pa--
they're in San Diego.

00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:05,070
You guys
can help each other,

00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,150
but you got to say
"yes" or "no" right now.

00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:08,110
Greiner: Well, so now
they're forcing your hands

00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,170
so that you don't listen
to what the other Sharks say.

00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:11,060
No, we're not.
It's just the perfect deal.

00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,130
You can say "no," but it's just
up to you to say -- Yeah.

00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:13,140
O'Leary:
You don't have to do any--

00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,150
You can listen
to the other offers.

00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,160
It's not -- You don't
have to do that.

00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,090
You know, there could be
a better offer

00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:18,140
waiting in the wings,
so...

00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,120
I think Mark's gonna
give you the 10-second clock.

00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,160
Here's the way I look at it --
there's no secrets anymore.

00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,080
You all know what we do.
You all watch the show.
You all do your homework.

00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,150
And if you say "no" to us,
we'll survive.

00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:29,110
If you want to
take your chances with them --

00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:32,130
But we don't want to do
all the back-and-forth.

00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:35,080
Reuben, there's an offer
coming from Lori.

00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,060
I would like
to give you an offer.

00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,090
Wait.
Give them a moment.
I would --

00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:39,090
If they listen
to your offer --

00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:40,160
Barbara, why
do you keep talking?

00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,160
Greiner:
I will give you --
Give them a moment of silence.

00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,010
I'm going to give you
an offer --

00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:43,355
Mark and Barbara
offered them

00:41:43,355 --> 00:41:45,090
exactly what
they were looking for.
Exactly.

00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:47,030
And I'm not -- I'm not saying
we're gonna stay in, guys.

00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,070
Guys, I'm not saying
we're gonna stay in.

00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,100
-Let's do it.
-Let's do it! Let's do it!

00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,120
I'm gonna give you
an offer --

00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,140
We thought it over,
and "Yes!"

00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,040
Smart judgment.
Yeah, we're coming up.

00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,010
-Yeah!
-Yeah.

00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:57,080
Thank you so much,
you guys.

00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,070
You didn't hear it.

00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:59,010
Oh, yeah!

00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:02,080
[ All talking ]

00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,100
You know we, really appreciate
all your feedback.

00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,090
You guys are awesome.
