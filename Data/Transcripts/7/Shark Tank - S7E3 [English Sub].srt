00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:51,378
IS THERE AN OPTION FOR ME
TO SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT, GUYS,

00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:53,780
I WANT TO START
PICKING MY SOCK"?
NOT RIGHT NOW. NO.

00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,384
I DON'T THINK
YOU EVER WANT TO GET THERE.
BECAUSE IT'S TOO HARD FOR YOU
TO HAVE THAT?

00:06:57,384 --> 00:07:00,020
RIGHT.
IF YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN
INVENTORY SKEWS

00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,254
BASED ON DEMAND
AND SELECTION,

00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,123
THIS WHOLE MODEL
GOES OUT THE WINDOW.

00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:05,258
WE GET FEEDBACK ALL THE TIME
FROM PEOPLE SAYING,

00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,193
"I CANNOT WAIT
UNTIL I OPEN MY MAILBOX

00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,195
AND THOSE FOOT CARDIGAN
SOCKS ARE THERE."

00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:12,899
JUST OUT OF INTEREST,
IF I GIVE YOU $250,000 FOR 10%,

00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,001
HOW DO I EVER GET
MY MONEY BACK?

00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:17,704
WE THINK, HONESTLY,
WITH THIS VALUATION

00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:18,405
AND THE $250,000,

00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:21,308
WE BELIEVE THAT YOU COULD
GET IT BACK IN THREE YEARS.

00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:24,144
WHY DO YOU THINK
THAT IT'LL TAKE THREE YEARS

00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:25,879
TO GET US BACK $250,000?

00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,047
THAT'S QUITE SOME TIME.

00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:29,149
I DON'T KNOW TIME FRAMES
IN TERMS OF GETTING MONEY BACK.

00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:31,384
I THINK THAT WE'RE GONNA MAKE
SURE WE'RE GONNA GET $3 MILLION.

00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,353
O'Leary:
IF YOU'RE WILLING TO GIVE
DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS,

00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:35,555
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE MANY OPTIONS
OF WHERE WE DEPLOY OUR CAPITAL.

00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:38,024
WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE HIGHEST
RETURN, LOWEST RISK.

00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,026
YOU KNOW,
I WOULD SAY THIS --

00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,494
WE BOOTSTRAPPED
THIS COMPANY.

00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:44,998
WE PUT $6,000 OF OUR OWN CASH
INTO IT. THAT'S IT.

00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,333
-IN THREE YEARS.
-GOOD FOR YOU GUYS.

00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,969
SO WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO GROW
THAT SUBSCRIPTION MODEL

00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,203
WITH JUST FINDING
NEW CUSTOMERS.

00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,404
WE FOUND, YOU KNOW,
EARLY ON,

00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:54,107
PEOPLE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
SOCK SUBSCRIPTIONS WAS A THING,

00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:55,575
SO WE'VE GOT TO GET
IN FRONT OF MORE PEOPLE.

00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:59,446
I THINK THEY'RE CUTE,
BUT IT'S A VERY CROWDED MARKET.

00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:01,414
TO ME, YOU'RE NOT DOING
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,650
JUST DOING IT
IN A DIFFERENT WAY.

00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,417
SURE.

00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:08,088
I'M NOT SURE HOW I WOULD MAKE
BACK MY $250,000 VERY QUICKLY.

00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,089
I'M OUT.

00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,223
-OKAY.
-THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,324
YEAH, THANKS, LORI.

00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,393
SO, YOU GUYS, YOU KNOW,
THIS NEVER HAPPENS,

00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:16,930
WHERE I ACTUALLY GIVE AN OFFER
TO TWO GUYS IN THEIR UNDERWEAR.

00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,299
[ LAUGHS ]

00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:25,305
I WILL GIVE YOU $250,000
FOR 22.5%.

00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:29,042
AND IT HAS TO BE CONTINGENT
THAT MY BAMBAS PARTNERS

00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:31,111
WANT TO WORK
WITH THE DEAL.

00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,879
I HAVE TO BE GOOD PARTNERS
TO THEM.

00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:33,613
-AWESOME.
-OKAY.

00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:37,550
I'LL GIVE YOU $250,000 FOR 15%
WITH SOME SCHEDULE OF RETURNS

00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,387
'CAUSE I DON'T REALLY SEE
A SOCK-SUBSCRIPTION BUSINESS

00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:43,056
DOING AN I.P.O.
ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE.

00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:44,991
SO, WHAT SCHEDULE?

00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,259
YEAH, WHAT DOES THAT
LOOK LIKE?

00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,395
DO QUARTERLY DISTRIBUTIONS TO
EVERYBODY, INCLUDING YOURSELVES.

00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:50,497
IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU START TO DISTRIBUTE MONEY.

00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:52,465
I TAKE IT OUT THE SAME TIME
YOU GUYS DO.

00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:56,169
IN THE LONG RUN, THAT'S WHY
YOU INVEST IN A BUSINESS.
RIGHT. MAKES SENSE.

00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:58,204
NO, THANKS FOR THAT OFFER.
THAT'S AWESOME.

00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,173
Carter: IF YOU'RE GONNA VALUE
THIS AS A TECH COMPANY

00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:03,043
AND EVENTUALLY RAISE
VENTURE CAPITAL,

00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,545
IT'S GONNA BE HARD
TO JUSTIFY TO INVESTORS

00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:10,183
THAT YOU'RE GIVEN DISTRIBUTIONS
TO A PREVIOUS TIER OF INVESTORS.

00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:14,387
AT MY COMPANY ATOM FACTORY,
WE PROBABLY INVESTED IN OVER

00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:19,192
ABOUT 65 TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES,
ALSO CONSUMER PACKAGED GOODS,

00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:22,929
IN ADDITION TO STANCE SOCKS,
WHICH, YOU KNOW,

00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,497
IS A ROCKET SHIP RIGHT NOW.

00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:27,333
WHAT I LIKE ABOUT YOU GUYS
IS THE FACT THAT YOU'RE GOING

00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,169
AFTER THIS
SUBSCRIPTION BUSINESS,

00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,237
WHICH I THINK THERE'S
A HUGE MARKET THERE.

00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:38,812
SO WHAT I'M GONNA OFFER
IS 250K FOR 15%.

00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:39,579
NO DISTRIBUTIONS.

00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:44,317
AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS
YOUR BRAND IS GONNA NEED

00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:45,518
IS A NARRATIVE.

00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:49,322
IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MAKE
YOUR BRAND DEFENSIBLE,

00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:53,126
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO CREATE
SOME SORT OF CONNECTION

00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,562
WITH THE CONSUMER
OUTSIDE OF THE SOCK.

00:09:55,562 --> 00:10:00,033
AND THAT'S A SPACE I THINK
I'M ABLE TO HELP YOU GUYS IN.

00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:02,335
AND THEN THERE'S ONE --
MARK.

00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,771
THEN THERE'S MARK.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING.

00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:05,205
ONE GUY LEFT.

00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:06,706
THE DALLAS GUY.

00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,515
Narrator: ONE SHARK IS OUT.

00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:17,684
BRYAN AND MATT HAVE THREE OFFERS
ON THE TABLE

00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:20,553
FOR THEIR SOCK-SUBSCRIPTION
COMPANY, FOOT CARDIGAN.

00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:23,389
BUT THEY HAVE YET TO HEAR
FROM MARK CUBAN.

00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,557
AND THEN THERE'S ONE --
MARK.

00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:27,160
AND THEN THERE'S MARK.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING.

00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,394
-ONE GUY LEFT.
-THE DALLAS GUY.

00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,230
SEE, THESE GUYS --
OTHER THAN TROY --

00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,265
THEY'RE, "WHAT CAN YOU
GIVE ME BACK IMMEDIATELY?"

00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:33,733
I'M MORE INTERESTED IN,
HOW BIG CAN WE GET?

00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:37,070
RIGHT. AND I THINK, AGAIN,
NOW THAT WE'RE FULL-TIME,

00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,205
WE FINALLY HAVE TIME
TO SCALE THIS THING.

00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,373
AND IF WE DID WHAT WE DID

00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,375
FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS
PART-TIME,

00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,477
WE ARE PLACING MASSIVE BETS
ON OURSELVES

00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,346
AND OUR FAMILIES'
LIVELIHOODS

00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:48,448
THAT WE'RE GONNA GROW
THIS THING, SO...

00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:49,415
ALL RIGHT,
WELL, I HAVE AN INTEREST.

00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,451
I'LL DO A STRAIGHT-UP
250K FOR 20%.

00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,386
WE'VE GOT FACILITIES
IN DALLAS.

00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:55,355
WE CAN TAKE OVER
YOUR ACCOUNTING.

00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,523
WE CAN TAKE BACK OFFICE.

00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:58,558
YOU CAN WORK
WITH ALL OUR TECH GUYS.

00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:00,293
I LIKE TROY'S IDEA
OF NARRATIVE.

00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:02,295
I THINK HE BRINGS
A UNIQUE SKILL SET THERE.

00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:03,630
I THINK YOUR STRENGTH IS,
YOU KNOW,

00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,532
THE TECHNICAL SIDE,
THE CONVERSION SIDE.

00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:07,467
I THINK WE --
YOU KNOW, WE CAN AMP IT UP.

00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,169
WE CAN DO THINGS
WITH THE MAVS.

00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,503
THERE'S ALL KINDS
OF PROMOTIONAL OPS.

00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,205
SO YOUR OFFER'S
$250,000, 20% --

00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:13,506

DOWN THE MIDDLE.

AND WHERE IT CAN GO,

AND THEY'VE ASKED ME
TO OFFICIATE THE CEREMONY.

00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:33,519
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL.

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,521
I LIKE TO MIX A LITTLE BUSINESS
AND PLEASURE TOGETHER SOMETIMES.

00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,423

SO, SHOW ME WHAT YOU BROUGHT.

00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:46,799
WE BROUGHT A HONEYMOON REGISTRY
FOR MATT AND ERICA.

00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,369
WE BROUGHT THE 20-MILLIMETER
BOTTLE BREACHER

00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:50,670
FOR EVERY GUY
AT THE WEDDING.

00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,172
WE'VE DECIDED
TO CUSTOMIZE CUPCAKE JARS

FOR THE BRIDE AND GROOM.

00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:56,442
O'Leary: ALL THREE OF THESE
COMPANIES ARE GOING TO BECOME

00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,711
PART OF WHAT I'M CALLING
MY SOMETHING WONDERFUL PLATFORM.

00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:01,614

IT'S THE ONE TIME IN YOUR LIFE

00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:15,361
WHERE YOU'RE COMPLETELY
IRRATIONAL ABOUT PRICE.

00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,363
Sara: KEVIN'S ATTENTION
TO OUR BUSINESS

00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:18,731
HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY
LIFE-CHANGING.

00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,600
IN THE EIGHT MONTHS
SINCE AIRING,

00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,568
WE'VE ALREADY DONE
$738,000 IN REVENUE.

00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:25,405
Eli: WHEN WE WERE PITCHING
ON "SHARK TANK,"

00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:27,140
WE HAD $640,000 IN SALES.

00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,608
IT'S ONLY BEEN SEVEN MONTHS,

00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:31,444
AND WE'VE ALREADY DONE
$4.2 MILLION.

00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:34,547
Tracey: SINCE PARTNERING
WITH KEVIN TWO YEARS AGO,

00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,450
OUR SALES HAVE NOW CLIMBED
TO $5.5 MILLION.

00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,152
IT IS ABSOLUTELY GREAT.

00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,386
AS A SHARK, WHEN I INVEST,

00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,655
I'M ALWAYS TRYING

00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:47,760

I INVESTED
IN THESE THREE COMPANIES.

LET'S BRING THE CONVENIENCE
BACK TO VALET.

00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:12,745
ANY QUESTIONS, SHARKS?

00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,781
O'Leary:
I HAVE A QUESTION.

00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:16,783
LET'S SAY I HAVE
A RESTAURANT,

00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:19,585
AND I HAVE A VERY BUOYANT
VALET BUSINESS.

00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,587
I'M PARKING
250 CARS A NIGHT.

00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,689
TELL ME HOW YOU ADD VALUE
TO MY SITUATION.

00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,691
YOU COME TO ME AS AN OWNER
AND SAY...

00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:30,663
SKIMMING AMONG VALET PROVIDERS,
IT'S KIND OF ACCEPTED LOSS,

00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:33,833
UP TO 30%, IN FACT,
'CAUSE IT'S CASH.

00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,602
ValPark MOBILE ELIMINATES
A GOOD PORTION OF THAT

00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,738
BY ALLOWING NOT ONLY
MOBILE TRANSACTIONS,

00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:40,006
BUT CREDIT-CARD TRANSACTIONS.

00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:43,476
Greiner: I'M NOT SURE I FULLY
UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WORKS.

00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:45,645
CAN YOU SHOW US?
YES, CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO US?

00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:46,879
SO, YOU WOULD DOWNLOAD
OUR APP.

00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,549
YOU MAKE A PROFILE --
MARK HAS MADE A PROFILE HERE --

00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:51,350
WITH YOUR NAME,
YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS,

00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,051
AND YOUR CREDIT-CARD NUMBER.

00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,754
WHEN YOU CREATE A PROFILE,
YOU ACTUALLY CREATE A SECURE PIN

00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:56,556
THAT IS ASSOCIATED
WITH YOUR PROFILE.

00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:58,491
SO YOU NEVER TAKE YOUR PHONE
OUT OF YOUR POCKET

00:15:58,491 --> 00:15:59,559
WHEN YOU'RE PARKING WITH US.

00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:00,827
ALL THE ATTENDANT ASKS FOR
IS YOUR NAME.

00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:02,562
-AND YOUR PIN.
-YOU SAY YOUR NAME.

00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:03,763
YOU PUT YOUR PIN IN.
YOU'RE CHARGED.

00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:04,897
-THAT'S IT. YOU'RE DONE.
-RIGHT.

00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,567
SO, RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE CLOSING UP YOUR TAB,

00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:08,768
YOU REQUEST YOUR VEHICLE.

00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:11,471
ALL ATTENDANTS AT THAT LOCATION
WITH THE DEVICE GETS AN ALERT.

00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:12,672
I THEN GET AN ALERT
SAYING MY VEHICLE

00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:13,940
WILL BE OUTSIDE
IN THREE TO FIVE MINUTES.

00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,609
WHEN IT'S OUTSIDE,
I THEN GET A SECONDARY ALERT,

00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,644
AND MY VEHICLE'S OUTSIDE
AND READY TO GO.

00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,646
HOW MANY LOCATIONS
ARE YOU IN RIGHT NOW?

00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,415
CURRENTLY,
WE'RE AT OVER 115.

00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:23,549
-GOOD FOR YOU.
-IN WHICH MARKETS?

00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:24,817
WE'RE IN WASHINGTON, D.C.,
MARYLAND, AND VIRGINIA.

00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,652
-GOOD FOR YOU.
-AND YOU CREATED THIS YOURSELF?

00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,887
I DESIGNED THIS MYSELF.

00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:31,290
I WIRE-FRAMED THIS, CONCEPTED
THIS, I DID ALL THE ASSETS.

00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:31,891
MY BUSINESS PARTNER OWNS

00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:34,026
THE LARGEST VALET COMPANY
ON THE EAST COAST.

00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:36,529
AND WHAT'S YOUR ARRANGEMENT
WITH YOUR BUSINESS PARTNER?

00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,531
HE OWNS
46% OF THE BUSINESS.

00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:39,632
MM-HMM.

00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:41,000
Johnson: HE WAS LOOKING
FOR A SOLUTION LIKE THIS

00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,369
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T TAKE
CREDIT CARDS.

00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:44,537
HOW MANY PEOPLE CARRY AROUND

00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:46,639
MORE THAN $25 AT ONCE
IN THEIR POCKET ANYMORE?

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,841
NO, YOU'RE SOLVING A PROBLEM.
THERE'S NO QUESTION.

00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,743
THE QUESTION IS,
HOW BIG CAN YOU GET?

00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:51,878
HE'S SAYING
HOW SCALABLE IS IT?

00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:53,880
YEAH, BECAUSE THERE'S
ONE OF THOSE IN EVERY MARKET --

00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,915
THE GUY WHO DOMINATES
VALET PARKING.

00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:58,718
YOU NEED TO GET TO YOUR PARTNER
IN EVERY CITY.

00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:00,086
IF I WENT AND LOOKED
AT SAN FRANCISCO,

00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:02,722
I'D FIND ONE GUY HAS 60%
OF ALL THE VALET COMPANIES

00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:03,956
AND THE OTHERS
ARE ALL SPLIT UP.

00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,791
YOU NEED THE 60% GUY
IN EVERY MARKET.

00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,760
-HOW ARE YOU GONNA DO IT?
-THAT'S THE PLAN.

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,596
LAST YEAR, WE STARTED
WITH BETA IN 33 LOCATIONS.

00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,331
NOW WE'RE AT OVER 115.

00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,566
SO WHAT'S YOUR SALES?

00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:14,867
LAST YEAR, WE DID $270,000.

00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,969
HOW MANY YEARS DID YOU SAY
YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT?

00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:19,438
WE STARTED IT LAST YEAR.
WE WENT LIVE LAST YEAR.

00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:20,673
AND WHAT PERCENTAGE
DO YOU TAKE?

00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:22,141
SO, FIRST YEAR --
THIS IS HOW WE MAKE OUR MONEY.

00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:25,411
WE ADDED AN 8.5% CONVENIENCE FEE
TO WHATEVER THE PRINCIPAL WAS.

00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,913
8.5% TO THE CONSUMER?

00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:28,881
THAT'S PASSED DOWN
TO THE CONSUMER.

00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,483
AND THIS IS WHY VENDORS
LOVE US --

00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:31,551
WE DON'T TAKE THEIR PRINCIPAL.

00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,520
NOW, ARE YOU SAYING
YOU DID $270,000 GROSS,

00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,055
AND THEN TO YOU,
BASICALLY,

00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,325
YOU WOULD HAVE DONE
APPROXIMATELY $25,000?

00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:39,825
$28,000.

00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,827
THIS YEAR,
OUR NEW BUSINESS MODEL --

00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,829
WE'VE MOVED
TO $15% CONVENIENCE FEE.

00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:46,465
WE SPLIT THE CREDIT-CARD FEE
DOWN THE MIDDLE

00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:47,033
WITH THE PROVIDER.

00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:50,736
AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE
A $49-PER-MONTH FEE

00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,606
FOR EACH LOCATION
AS A VENDOR.

00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:55,908
THIS IS A VERY, VERY OLD MARKET
IN AN INDUSTRY

00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:59,579
THAT THEY HAVE NOT EVER SEEN
AN URGE OR NEED TO IMPROVE UPON.

00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,714
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS
IN TECH RIGHT NOW

00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:02,949
IS IT'S A COPYCAT MARKET.

00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:04,951
SO THE MOMENT
YOU GET SOME HEAT,

00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:07,920
THIS IS GONNA SCALE VERY QUICKLY
AROUND THE WORLD.

00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,689
HOW DO YOU PREVENT YOURSELF

00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:11,958
FROM ONLY BEING STUCK
IN THAT TRI-STATE AREA?

00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,026
HOW DO YOU GET TO SCALE
MORE QUICKLY?

00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,529
I NEED AN AMBASSADOR
IN EACH CITY.

00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:17,964
HAVE YOU TRIED
TO RAISE MONEY?

00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:21,601
SO, ALL THIS WAS DONE BY MYSELF
OUT OF MY OWN MONEY SO FAR.

00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,603
-HOW MUCH?
-$100,000 MYSELF.

00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,671
-DAMN. THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.
-YOU'RE IN.

00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,340
YEAH, I'M IN IT TILL THE END.
SO...

00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:27,907
I SEE IT WORK, RIGHT?

00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:29,742
I MEAN, IT DOES
WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO.

00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:31,611
THE PROBLEM, LIKE,
WITH A LOT OF APPS

00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,512
IS HOW MUCH MONEY
CAN YOU ACTUALLY MAKE?

00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,848
49 BUCKS PER LOCATION,
RIGHT?

00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:39,051
GET 1,000 LOCATIONS,
10 TIMES THE SIZE.

00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:43,489
TO YOU, AS A ONE-MAN OPERATOR,
THAT'S MONEY IN THE BANK, RIGHT?

00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:44,857
YOU'RE SMILING ALL THE WAY.

00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:47,393
BUT NOW,
OUT OF 115 LOCATIONS,

00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:47,994
YOU MADE $28,000,

00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:51,030
AND EVEN IF YOU DOUBLE THAT,
YOU'VE MADE $56,000.

00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,264
-YEAH, BUT YOU'RE SPEAKING --
-THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.

00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,734
YOU'RE SPEAKING ON THE SAME
PRINCIPLES AND BUSINESS MODEL

00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:55,968
THAT UBER'S ESTABLISHED ON,
OR LYFT.

00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,737
O'Leary:
NO, NO. IT'S DIFFERENT.
NO, WE'RE NOT. NO, WE'RE NOT.

00:18:57,737 --> 00:18:58,804
IT'S NOT DIFFERENT.

00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,840
THERE IS A PRINTABLE FEE
THAT GOES TO THE DRIVER,

00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,775
AND THERE IS A FEE
THAT'S ADDED ON TOP.

00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:04,910
LET'S USE UBER
AS THE EXAMPLE, RIGHT?

00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,046
THERE'S A REASON WHY
THEY'RE OKAY LOSING MONEY --

00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:09,148
'CAUSE THEY'VE RAISED
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, RIGHT?

00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,518
AND THEY'RE OUT THERE
JUST TRYING TO BUILD A BRAND...
YEAH.

00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:13,085
...TRYING TO GET PEOPLE --

00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:14,820
WHEN THEY THINK TRANSPORTATION,
THINK UBER.

00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,590
BUT THE BIGGER POINT
IS THEY CAN LIVE OFF OF CRUMBS

00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,691
BASED OFF OF THE VOLUME.

00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:20,860
YOU'RE NOT IN A POSITION
TO LIVE OFF OF CRUMBS.

00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,862
AND THERE'S NOT ENOUGH CRUMBS
OUT THERE

00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:24,664
TO MAKE THE MONEY,
REAL MONEY.

00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:27,833
I INVESTED IN UBER
IN 2011...

00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,934
I'M AWARE.

00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:31,971
...WHEN IT WAS ONLY
IN SAN FRANCISCO,

00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:35,808
AND UBER WAS GOING
AFTER THE ENTIRE ECOSYSTEM.

00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:38,611
YOU KNOW, AND THE SIZE
OF THE MARKET BECAME HUMONGOUS.

00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:39,879
AND I THINK WITH ValPark,

00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:42,715
THAT YOU'RE GOING AFTER
A VERY NICHE MARKET.

00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:43,849
IT'S NOT PROVEN YET.

00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,118
IT'S 115 LOCATIONS
IN A TRI-STATE AREA.

00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:48,954
THAT'S NOT A LOT
OF REAL ESTATE RIGHT NOW.

00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,856
YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY CAN
COME IN YOUR OWN MARKET

00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:51,957
AND TAKE THAT MARKET.

00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,726
NO ONE CAN COME INTO MY MARKET
AND TAKE IT AWAY.

00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:55,027
YOU'RE UNDERESTIMATING
YOUR COMPETITION.

00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,729
THERE'S ANOTHER KID
IN A GARAGE

00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:58,597
THAT WANTS TO EAT YOUR LUNCH
RIGHT NOW.

00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:00,766
I OWN THE MAJORITY SHARE.

00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:01,901
YOU DON'T OWN IT.

00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:03,269
YOU THINK YOU OWN IT,
BUT NEVER UNDERESTIMATE --

00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:06,672
I OWN THE MAJORITY SHARE, AND I
JUST DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING.

00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:07,807
THERE'S NO FEASIBLE SCENARIO.

00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,376
I DON'T SEE MY INVESTMENT
HAPPENING. I'M OUT.

00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:15,781
I RESPECT YOUR CONFIDENCE.
I RESPECT YOUR EFFORT.

00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:18,784
BUT IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE WORTH
INVESTING 300K,

00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:21,120
I'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO SEE
SOMETHING BIG.

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,956
I TURNED DOWN UBER.
I WAS THE FIRST GUY HE WENT TO.

00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,925
I TOLD HIM
IT WAS GONNA BE TOO HARD

00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:27,993
TO GET PAST
ALL THE TAXICAB COMMISSIONS

00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:30,730
AND THAT HE'D HAVE TO RAISE
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,198
SO I WAS THE BIG IDIOT
THAT SAID NO.

00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:34,967
I'M HOPING I'M GONNA BE
JUST AS BIG AN IDIOT FOR YOU

00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,669
AND THAT YOU GET JUST AS BIG.

00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:37,770
YEAH.

00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,805
BUT I DON'T SEE IT SCALING
BIG ENOUGH TO GET A RETURN.

00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:41,707
SO FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.

00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:42,742
I UNDERSTAND.

00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,977
I'M SORRY,
I DON'T SEE THE VISION

00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:48,714
FOR WORLD DOMINATION
OF VALET-PARKING SYSTEMS HERE.

00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:50,649
I JUST DON'T.
I'M OUT.

00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:52,752
I UNDERSTAND.

00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:55,521
YOU KNOW,
YOU ALREADY HAVE A GREAT PARTNER

00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:56,155
WHO'S AT 46%, RIGHT?

00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:59,325
SO THAT, FOR ME,
IS WHERE I HAVE A PROBLEM.

00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:01,360
I LIKE HAVING A PARTNERSHIP
WHERE I FEEL LIKE

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,096
WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING
FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED.

00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,867
I DON'T FEEL IT'S RIGHT FOR ME
TO TAKE 30% OF YOUR COMPANY,

00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:10,002
BUT I DON'T THINK
IT'S WORTH MY TIME

00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:12,638
TO TAKE ANYTHING LESS,
SO I'M OUT.

00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:13,839
I UNDERSTAND.

00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,876
OKAY, ONE SHARK LEFT,
I THINK.

00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:20,012
I SEE THIS
AS A VALUABLE PROPERTY.

00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:22,848
I SEE THIS AS SOMETHING
THAT CAN GROW INTO CAR WASHES,

00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:24,917
GAS STATIONS,
AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE...

00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:26,786
-EXACTLY.
-...WHERE, YOU KNOW,

00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,053
MY DAUGHTERS OR MY WIFE
OR MY MOTHER,

00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:29,321
THEY DON'T WANT TO GET
OUT OF THE CAR,

00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:34,260
BUT I WOULD DESPERATELY NEED
A MARK, A TROY --

00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:40,199
WHO UNDERSTANDS SOFTWARE
AND TECHNOLOGY TO BE MY PARTNER.

00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:42,935
SO I NEED ONE OF THESE
INDIVIDUALS IN.

00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:45,204
AND IF ANYBODY
WANTS TO COME BACK IN,

00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:48,941
THEN I'M OKAY WITH $300,000
FOR 20%.

00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:50,242
BUT THEY KNOW
BETTER THAN I DO.

00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:53,179
IT'S SCALABLE TO EVEN THE POINT
OF HOME ACCESS TO YOUR OWN HOME.

00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:55,548
SEE IF YOU CAN GET
ANOTHER SHARK BACK IN.

00:21:56,182 --> 00:21:59,485
YEAH, I JUST DON'T SEE IT
BEING BIG ENOUGH. I'M SORRY.

00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:00,419
TROY?

00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:04,723
YOU'RE NOT PARANOID ENOUGH
FOR ME.

00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:05,958
I LOVE A PARANOID FOUNDER...

00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,059
RIGHT? [ LAUGHS ]

00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,161
...WHO THINKS THERE'S SOMEBODY
IN A GARAGE

00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,830
WAITING TO EAT HIS LUNCH.

00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,332
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
WITH THAT BEING SAID...

00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:15,835
...I'M OUT.

00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:16,769
THANK YOU.

00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:17,803
-GOOD LUCK.
-GOOD LUCK.

00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:19,705
-GO OUT AND CRUSH IT, MAN.
-GOOD LUCK.

00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:23,042
Johnson:
WE'RE NOT STOPPING.

00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:24,343
WE'VE DONE THIS
ON A SHOESTRING BUDGET.

00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,946
WE'RE GETTING MORE TRACTION.
WE'RE JUST GETTING RAMPED UP.

00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:28,047
WE'RE FAR AHEAD OF COMPETITION

00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:29,815
THAT HAD A LOT MORE TIME
THAN WE DID.

00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:30,783
HE'LL MAKE MONEY.

00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:31,951
IT'LL BE A GOOD BUSINESS
FOR HIM.

00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:34,587
BUT IT WON'T BE BIG ENOUGH
TO MAKE AN INVESTOR MONEY.

00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:35,554
YEAH.

00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:47,633

A TWIST ON A CLASSIC ACCESSORY.

WE'RE THE TWO GUYS BOW TIE
COMPANY FROM TULSA, OKLAHOMA.

00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:06,785
WE'RE SEEKING $150,000 IN
EXCHANGE FOR 10% OF OUR COMPANY.

00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,087
WE HAVEN'T ALL BEEN BLESSED

00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:11,357
WITH MR. WONDERFUL'S STRIKING
GOOD LOOKS AND ENDEARING CHARM.

00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:14,927
SOME OF US MERE MORTALS,
WE NEED A LITTLE BIT OF HELP.

00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:17,162
AND WE RELY ON OUR CLOTHES
TO STAND OUT.

00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:19,298
I MEAN, GUYS,
WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE.

00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:21,200
YOU'RE AN ELIGIBLE BACHELOR
AT A FRIEND'S WEDDING

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,069
TRYING TO GET BRIDESMAID NUMBER
THREE TO DANCE WITH YOU,

00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,170
OR AT LEAST NOTICE YOU.

00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:28,140
THE PROBLEM IS, YOU LOOK
JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE --

00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,275
SAME OLD SUIT AND TIE.

00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:31,410
BUT DON'T WORRY.
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR.

00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,980
SEPARATE YOURSELF FROM THE CROWD
WITH ONE OF OUR WOODEN BOW TIES.

00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,115
WE CLEARLY CANNOT HELP YOU

00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:38,050
WITH THE ELECTRIC SLIDE
OR THE WOBBLE,

00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,085
BUT WE CAN AT LEAST
GET YOU IN THE GAME.

00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,288
OUR HAND-CRAFTED ACCESSORIES
WILL MAKE A STATEMENT

00:23:42,288 --> 00:23:44,990
ON THE DANCE FLOOR,
AT THE OFFICE CHRISTMAS PARTY,

00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,125
OR ON YOUR NEXT HOT DATE.

00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:48,360
OUR BOW TIES ARE MADE USING
OLD-SCHOOL CRAFTSMANSHIP.

00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,296
WE USE A VARIETY
OF EXOTIC HARDWOODS

00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:52,331
LIKE PERUVIAN WALNUT
OR AFRICAN ZEBRA WOOD.

00:23:52,331 --> 00:23:55,167
BUT OUR MODERN STYLE DOESN'T
STOP WITH OUR BOW TIES.

00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,403
TWO GUYS CAN SPRUCE UP
YOUR LAPEL, YOUR POCKET,

THESE ARE BEAUTIFULLY
CRAFTED PIECES

AND GROW EVEN FINER OVER TIME.

00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:10,683

00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:11,150
KNOCK ON WOOD.

WE'D LOVE TO HAND OUT
SOME SAMPLES,

IF YOU GUYS ARE ALL RIGHT
WITH THAT.
PLEASE.

00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:17,256
FINALLY, A MAN WHO GETS IT RIGHT
AND STARTS ON THIS END.

00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:19,258
-THAT'S RIGHT.
-I WAS JUST GONNA SAY...

00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:20,893
TROY, I GOT A BLACK FEDORA
FOR YOU.

00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:21,994
OH, I DON'T GET A HAT?

YOU HAVE A REALLY BIG HEAD,

00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:26,065
-AND NOT JUST YOUR EGO.

00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:28,033

THERE YOU GO,
MR. WONDERFUL.

00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:30,002
-THANK YOU.
-UH-HUH.

00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:32,237
THIS IS THE SKYLINE
OF CHICAGO.

00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:34,340
-YOU GOT IT.
-HOW CREATIVE.

00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,407
-THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
-YOU GOT IT.

00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,776
SO, WHERE ARE YOU CURRENTLY
SELLING THESE?

00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:38,310
NOWHERE.

00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,212
THOSE ARE JUST GETTING
READY TO LAUNCH.

00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:43,349
WE'RE GONNA BE GOING TO A MARKET
IN ATLANTA HERE NEXT MONTH.

00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:45,351
HOW MUCH DOES
THE BOW TIE COST?
THE CORE PRODUCT,
I ASSUME IS THE BOW TIE.

00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:47,286
THAT'S WHAT YOU STARTED WITH,
RIGHT?
WE STARTED WITH THE BOW TIE.

00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:50,122
THE BOW TIE RETAILS
FROM $45 TO $95.

00:24:50,122 --> 00:24:52,825
AND WHAT'S IT COST FOR YOU
TO MAKE ONE OF THESE?

00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,026
BOW TIES -- ABOUT $7.50.

00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:56,295
AND WHERE AND HOW ARE YOU
SELLING THESE NOW?

00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:58,197
THE MAJORITY OF OUR SALES
COME THROUGH OUR WEBSITE.

00:24:58,197 --> 00:24:59,264
WE OBVIOUSLY LOVE THAT.

00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:00,366
WE GET TO KEEP
THE MAJORITY OF THE MONEY.

00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:02,134
75% OF THE SALES
COME THROUGH THE WEBSITE.

00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:04,269
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE IN SALES
LAST YEAR?

00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:06,071
SO, LAST YEAR,
WE DID $407,000.

00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:08,107
WE'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS
FOR ABOUT 2 1/2 YEARS.

00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:09,975
WE'VE DONE
JUST SHY OF $1 MILLION.

00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:10,976
WOW.

00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:13,045
SO, WE DO CUSTOM
REALLY WELL.

00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:16,215
WE CAN CUSTOMIZE THE FRONT
OF THESE TO BE ANYTHING.

00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:17,516
WE SHIP OUT CUSTOM ORDERS
NEXT DAY.

00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,219
BECAUSE OF THE PROCESS
AND THE WAY WE PROCESS THINGS,

00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:22,087
WE CAN DO
ABOUT 1,000 BOW TIES A WEEK.

00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:23,489
YOUR LOGISTICS
ARE AMAZING, THEN.

00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:26,025
-WE SHIP OUT --
-AND THAT'S YOUR KEY?

00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,426
YOUR SATISFACTION
IS IMMEDIATE?

00:25:27,426 --> 00:25:29,328
WE HAVE SOLD
OVER 25,000 PIECES.

00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:31,530
WE HAVE HAD LESS THAN
30 RETURNS FOR DEFECT.

00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:35,167
HOW ARE YOU CURRENTLY GETTING
THE WORD OUT ON THE PRODUCT?

00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:36,335
WE'VE GOT TO GET THIS

00:25:36,335 --> 00:25:38,971
ON TASTEMAKERS
AND STYLE INFLUENCERS.

00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:40,239
WE'VE WORKED REALLY HARD.

00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:41,373
I'M AN AVID NBA FAN,

00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:44,076
SO A NATURAL OUTLET FOR ME
WAS THE NBA.

00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:46,078
MIKE CONLEY WAS THE ONE
WHO WORE OUR BOW TIE

00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:48,047
DURING THE NBA PLAYOFFS,
AND IT ACTUALLY --

00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:49,548
HE GOT NOTICED
DURING THE PRESS CONFERENCE.

00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,317
THEY DID A SEPARATE INTERVIEW,
THE GUYS ON "INSIDE THE NBA."

00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:53,786
CHUCK, SHAQ, ERNIE --
WE SENT THEM SOME.

00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:56,321
THEY WORE THEM.
THEY ALL TALKED ABOUT IT.
DID YOU SEE A SALES LIFT
AFTER THAT?

00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:59,124
DEFINITELY.
DEFINITELY, YEAH.
ABSOLUTELY.

00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:00,426
Carter:
I LOVE THIS STORY.

00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:02,461
I THINK THE FEDORAS
ARE FANTASTIC.

00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:05,998
YOU ACTUALLY SHOULD MAKE IT
A LITTLE SMALLER FOR MY HEAD.

00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:08,300
LOOKS REALLY GOOD
ON DAYMOND.

00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:12,237
AND I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY
MORE OF HIS EXPERTISE

00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,939
THAN IT IS MINE.

00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:16,942
AND FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.

00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:17,609
OKAY.

00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:20,412
WE'LL GET YOU A SMALLER FEDORA.
WE GOT ONE FOR YOU.

00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,448
LET ME ASK YOU GUYS
A QUESTION ABOUT THIS.

00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:24,249
AND I WANT YOUR FEEDBACK
ON IT.

00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,218
YOU KNOW,
I'VE GOT A LOT OF COMPANIES

00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:28,887
INVOLVED IN THE WEDDING
AND SPECIAL EVENTS SPACE.

00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:29,321
ALL WE HEAR.

00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:31,123
HONEYFUND, BOTTLE BREACHER,

00:26:31,123 --> 00:26:33,225
WICKED GOOD CUPCAKES,
O'LEARY WINES.

00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:36,161
I CALL IT MR. WONDERFUL'S
PLATFORM OF LOVE.

00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:37,529
-OH, GOD.
-SO WHAT I TRY AND DO

00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:39,565
IS INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO USE
ALL THE SERVICES

00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:42,134
WHEN THEY HAVE A WEDDING
OR AN ENGAGEMENT PARTY.

00:26:42,134 --> 00:26:44,036
-THAT'S THE IDEA.
-YEAH.

00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:45,337
HOW MUCH DOES THAT FIT?

00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:48,006
HOW MUCH DOES THIS
FIT INTO THAT?

00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:49,174
SO, THE PLATFORM OF LOVE --

00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:51,276
THE BOW TIES ARE GONNA BE
A GREAT FIT FOR THAT.

00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,212
THE LAPELS AND POCKET SQUARES,
AS WELL,

00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:55,347
BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT
THEIR WEDDING TO BE DIALED IN.

00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,349
WE ACTUALLY EVEN ALLOW PEOPLE,
IF THEY WANT TO,

00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:59,084
TO MAIL US
THEIR OWN FABRIC,

00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:00,486
AND WE CAN MAKE THE BOW TIES
OUT OF THAT.

00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:03,055
I LIKE THREE TIMES
IN PEOPLE'S LIVES --

00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:03,589
WHEN THEY'RE BORN,

00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:05,591
WHEN THEY GET MARRIED,
AND WHEN THEY DIE

00:27:05,591 --> 00:27:08,327
BECAUSE THEY THROW CAUTION
TO THE WIND ON PRICING.

00:27:08,327 --> 00:27:10,462
I'D LIKE TO INCLUDE THIS
ON MY PLATFORM OF LOVE,

00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,364
AND I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER HERE.

00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:15,367
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU $150,000,

YOU WERE OUT --

A POTENTIAL PARTNERSHIP,

THAT WE COULD POSSIBLY FIND

WITH BOTH OF YOU TOGETHER?

I AM NOT ADVERSE
TO WORKING WITH TROY, YOU KNOW,

00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:55,334
JUST DUE TO THE FACT
THAT I THINK THAT HE CAN

00:28:55,334 --> 00:28:57,769
BRING VALUE
WITH HIS MUSIC RELATIONS.

00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:02,474
IF HE WOULD BE INTERESTED,
THEN I THINK THAT TROY AND I --

00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:06,612
I WOULD NEED TO GO UP TO 30%
BECAUSE I NEED TO BE ABLE TO

00:29:06,612 --> 00:29:10,515
GET UP AND MAKE A FAIR SHARE
OF MONEY OFF OF THIS.

IN PARTNERING WITH TROY
ON A DEAL.

00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,643

00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:41,647

AND KIND OF USE
THE EDGE OF IT.

00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:58,730
THE GREAT THING ABOUT IT
IS THAT YOU CAN CONTROL

00:34:58,730 --> 00:34:59,931
THE AMOUNT
THAT YOU PUT ON IT.

00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,067
SO YOU CAN TRY JUST A LITTLE BIT
AND SEE HOW IT WORKS,

00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:03,835
AND YOU CAN GIVE IT
A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:05,537
AND SEE WHAT YOU LIKE
ABOUT IT.

00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:06,605
HEY, YOU GUYS DID AWESOME.

00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:07,038
-WHOO-HOO!
-GOOD JOB, GUYS.

00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:08,073
-GOOD JOB.
-GOOD JOB, GUYS.

00:35:08,073 --> 00:35:09,574
-GIVE ME FIVE.
-I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:11,109
-BYE, DAD.
-BYE.

00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,844
HOW DID YOU COME UP
WITH THIS IDEA?

00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:15,747
SO, FIVE YEARS AGO,
I WAS A TOURING AUDIO ENGINEER.

00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:17,749
I WORKED
IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY,

00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:19,884
AND I WORKED OUTSIDE
IN THE SUMMER.

00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:22,787
WE DID A TON OF OUTDOOR CONCERTS
AND FESTIVALS.

00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,155
AND I WOULD GET SUPER SWEATY.

00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:26,224
MY GLASSES
WERE ALWAYS SLIDING DOWN.

00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:29,127
AND I LOOKED ALL OVER
THE INTERNET FOR A SOLUTION.

00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,896
EVERYTHING I FOUND
WAS EITHER UNCOMFORTABLE,

00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:34,766
IT DIDN'T WORK,
OR IT WAS JUST STRAIGHT-UP UGLY.

00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:36,301
SO, IT'S MADE OUT OF BEESWAX?

00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:41,039
YEAH, SO, IT'S A BEESWAX BASE,
BUT IT'S A SPECIAL FORMULATION.

00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:44,976
SO IT'S NOT ChapStick, ALTHOUGH
WE HAVE THE LIP-BALM CONTAINER.

00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,145
IT'S A COMPLETELY NEW
FORMULATION.

00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,147
BUT ALL THE INGREDIENTS
THAT ARE IN THERE

00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,016
ARE ALL-NATURAL,
COMPLETELY ORGANIC,

00:35:51,016 --> 00:35:53,018
AND THEY'RE COSMETIC-GRADE
INGREDIENTS.

00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:54,786
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT YOUR FACE

00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:55,920
BREAKING OUT
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,989
WHERE DOES IT SIT AT
ON THE SHELF?

00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,091
WE SELL ONLINE -- $10.

00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:03,995
AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE
30 WHOLESALERS.

00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,930
AND WHAT'S THE COST OF GOODS?

00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,098
-IT'S 35 CENTS PER TUBE.
-WHOA.

00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:09,067
-AT LEAST YOU GOT GOOD MARGINS.
-YOU HAVE A NICE MARGIN.

00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:11,169
-WE HAVE GREAT MARGINS, YEAH.
-AND HOW MUCH HAVE YOU SOLD?

00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,838
SO, WE HAVE SOLD,
TO DATE...

00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:14,806
$136,000.

00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:16,074
Cuban: WELL, GOOD.

00:36:16,074 --> 00:36:19,811
AND OFF OF THE $136,000,
WE HAVE $65,000 IN PROFIT.

00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:21,246
-WOW.
-OVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME?

00:36:21,246 --> 00:36:23,948
THAT'S THE EXCITING PART --
WE JUST STARTED.

00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:26,017
APRIL OF LAST YEAR,
WE BEGAN SELLING

00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,286
DIRECT TO THE CONSUMER
ONLINE VIA OUR WEBSITE.

00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:32,057
AND WHEN WE STARTED DOING THAT,
WE GOT A TON OF PUSH ONLINE.

00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:35,160
WE WERE FEATURED IN MASHABLE,
UNCRATE, BUZZFEED, AOL.

00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,262
-YAHOO!, <i>DAILY MAIL.</i>
<i>-DAILY MAIL.</i>

00:36:37,262 --> 00:36:39,864
YOU'RE GETTING --
I CALL IT P.R. VIAGRA, RIGHT?

00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:40,999
YOU'RE GETTING ALL THESE --

00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:43,168
YEAH, WE HAVE TONS OF SPIKES
AND VALLEYS.

00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:46,037
ALL YOUR SPIKES THAT RELATE
TO WHEN YOU GET MEDIA, RIGHT?

00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,972
HOW ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITHOUT MEDIA?

00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:50,008
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WHEN THE MEDIA DIES?

00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:52,077
SO, WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE
DOING WHAT WORKS.

00:36:52,077 --> 00:36:54,979
RIGHT NOW WE'RE MEASURING
EVERYTHING THAT WE DO ON SOCIAL.

00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:56,081
SO WE'RE GOING OUT THERE,

00:36:56,081 --> 00:36:58,183
AND WE'RE JUST STIRRING UP
THE CONVERSATION.

00:36:58,183 --> 00:37:00,251
WE'RE GONNA KEEP DOING
WHAT WE DO BETTER,

00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:04,022
AND THEN WE'RE GOING
TO IMPROVE ON IT.

00:37:04,022 --> 00:37:06,124
HOW MANY RE-ORDERS
ARE YOU GETTING

00:37:06,124 --> 00:37:08,993
FROM THE PEOPLE
THAT HAVE ORDERED IN THE PAST?

00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:10,161
WE'VE ESTIMATED
THAT YOU'LL GET

00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,963
SIX TO EIGHT MONTHS
OUT OF A SINGLE TUBE.

00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:13,131
SO JUST NOW,
WE'RE STARTING TO SEE

00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:14,766
PEOPLE COME BACK
AND RE-ORDER.

00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:15,400
THAT'S A LOT OF TIME.

00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,068
Greiner: YEAH, 'CAUSE IT DOESN'T
RUN OUT THAT FAST.

00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,003
-YOU JUST USE A LITTLE BIT.
-IT DOESN'T RUN OUT THAT FAST.

00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:20,305
YOU JUST USE A LITTLE BIT.

00:37:20,305 --> 00:37:22,907
EIGHT MONTHS IS AN ETERNITY
BEFORE THE RE-PURCHASE.

00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:23,942
I AGREE.

00:37:23,942 --> 00:37:25,910
I WOULD MAKE THE TUBE
SMALLER, THINNER,

00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,079
SO IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
IT'S LIP BALM.

00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,248
AND I WOULD REDUCE THE AMOUNT
BY 60%.

00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,885
SO I'M BASICALLY ONLY SELLING
90 DAYS' WORTH OF SUPPLY.

00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:36,087
I'D DROP THE PRICE
TO $3.99, TO $4.99.

00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,956
AND THEN I'D FIND OUT
THE SWEET SPOT.

00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:39,290
NOBODY'S GONNA SPEND $10
ON NERDWAX.

00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:42,227
IT'S TOO MUCH MONEY.
THAT'S THE WORST THING
THEY COULD EVER DO.

00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:43,962
AND, LOOK,
I DON'T CARE WHAT MARK THINKS.

00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:45,196
-IT WOULD BE HORRIBLE.
-I'M ALWAYS RIGHT.

00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:47,899
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING HERE.
THIS IS WHY IT'S NOT WORKING.

00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:50,235
-WE'RE PROFITABLE TODAY.
-EXACTLY!

00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:54,305
I THINK YOU'D SELL SO MUCH MORE
IF YOUR PRICE WAS WAY LOWER.

00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:55,974
YEAH, THAT WOULD BE
A HUGE MISTAKE.

00:37:55,974 --> 00:37:57,175
NO, WELL --

00:37:57,175 --> 00:38:00,178
TO ME, YOU NEED TO GET OUT
THERE, GET WIDESPREAD...

00:38:00,178 --> 00:38:02,580
-NO.
-...AND MOVE VOLUME.

00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,882
NO.

00:38:03,882 --> 00:38:04,983
I DON'T SEE THIS --

00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:06,384
WELL, I KNOW YOU DON'T AGREE
WITH ME, MARK,

00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:09,120
BUT I'VE SOLD A LOT OF PRODUCT
OVER THE YEARS.
YEAH.

00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:14,292
I ALWAYS THINK IT'S SMART
TO CRAWL, THEN WALK, THEN RUN.

00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,061
AND I FEEL LIKE
I'M LYING TO MYSELF IF I SAID,

00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:19,063
"I THINK I'LL MAKE BACK
MY MONEY."

00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:22,233
SO I'M OUT.

00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:26,004
OKAY, SO, IT'S TOO EARLY
FOR ME,

00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:28,239
AND I DON'T THINK YOU NEED
THE INVESTMENT. I'M OUT.

00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,074
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT,
DAYMOND.

00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:34,045
WE ARE HERE FOR AN INVESTMENT
FOR A VERY SPECIFIC REASON.

00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:35,313
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA USE
THE MONEY FOR?

00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,183
WE NEED WORKING CAPITAL
TO GROW THIS THING AND SCALE.

00:38:38,183 --> 00:38:40,151
WHY GIVE AWAY
PART OF YOUR COMPANY RIGHT NOW

00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,220
-FOR THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY?
-YEAH, I MEAN, LOOK --

00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,689
THIS IS THE ONLY TIME
YOU NEED TO VALUE SWEAT,
WHICH IS SWEAT EQUITY.

00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:47,525
OH, AND THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE PUTTING IN.
IN A YEAR FROM NOW, THAT 20%
WILL BE WORTH SO MUCH MORE.

00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:49,394
SO WE'RE PUTTING IT IN, AND
WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO DO THAT.

00:38:49,394 --> 00:38:50,595
WE'RE NOT AFRAID OF WORK.
WE'VE PROVEN THAT.

00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:52,330
WE'RE GONNA DO IT.
WE'RE SCRAPPY.
WE'RE GONNA HUSTLE.

00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,099
GUYS, I BEG YOU NOT TO TAKE IN
ANY MONEY RIGHT NOW.

00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:57,268
I KNOW THAT WE TOOK A RISK
IN BEING HERE EARLY,

00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:59,938
BUT I ALSO KNOW
THAT EVERYTHING THAT HAS COME,

00:38:59,938 --> 00:39:02,140
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET UP THERE
AND CRUSH IT.

00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,975
SO I KNOW
THAT WE CAN DO THIS.

00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:06,010
AND I KNOW THAT GOING
BEYOND THIS,

00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,512
WE'RE GONNA
JUST FIGURE IT OUT.

00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:11,182
HERE'S THE ONLY WAY I WOULD
DO THIS DEAL, ALL RIGHT?

00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:15,320
I'M A MARKETING GENIUS, OKAY?
I KNOW THAT ABOUT MYSELF.

00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,189
THE WAY THIS THING WORKS,
FOR ME,

00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,225
IS YOU'RE SO EARLY,
YET YOU DO NEED CAPITAL.

00:39:20,225 --> 00:39:22,460
THIS IS VENTURE DEBT.
IT'S THE ONLY WAY I WOULD DO IT.

00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,096
HERE COMES
HIS BLOOD-SUCKING OFFER.
SILENCE.

00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:26,998
I WANT SILENCE
SO THEY CAN HEAR THE OFFER.

00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:29,267
I THINK YOU'RE A PRODUCT,
NOT A COMPANY.

00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:31,369
SO I'M WILLING TO GIVE YOU
$80,000,

00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:34,973
BUT I WANT 10% OF SALES
UNTIL I GET $240,000 BACK.

00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:36,441
AND BECAUSE I'M MR. WONDERFUL,

00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:39,777
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME
3% OF THE COMPANY.

00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,114
LISTEN, LET'S DEAL
WITH THE TRUTH, OKAY?

00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:45,149
IT'S A PRODUCT.
IT'S NOT A COMPANY.

00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:48,386
GUYS, I THINK
TRYING TO GO HIGH-VOLUME --

00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:51,222
BIGGEST MISTAKE
YOU CAN MAKE.

00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:57,128
GO FROM $100,000 IN SALES
TO $500,000

00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:59,197
TO $1 MILLION IN SALES,

00:39:59,197 --> 00:40:03,101
AND, OH, YOU'LL BE MAKING
$900,000 A YEAR.

00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:05,103
-IT COULD BE A WHOLE LOT WORSE.
-YEAH.

00:40:05,103 --> 00:40:07,305
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU TRY TO GET
TOO BIG TOO FAST,

00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:09,374
THINGS GO IN DIRECTIONS
YOU DON'T EXPECT.

00:40:09,374 --> 00:40:11,976
RIGHT NOW YOU CAN CONTROL
YOUR OWN DESTINY.

00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:14,479
THIS IS A GREAT
SMALL BUSINESS,

00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:17,115
BUT IT'S NOT REALLY
AN INVESTABLE BUSINESS.

00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:19,083
AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.

00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,351
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT,
MARK.

00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:22,153
I REALLY WANTED TO WORK
WITH YOU.

00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:23,821
ALL RIGHT.
TROY'S STILL IN.

00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:24,289
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:27,625
LET'S HAVE SOME FUN.

00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:32,530
I AGREE, YOU GUYS ARE EARLY,
BUT I LIKE TO BE THERE EARLY.

00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:36,301
SO, I WAS ONE OF THE EARLY
INVESTORS IN WARBY PARKER --

00:40:36,301 --> 00:40:40,171
THE FASTEST-GROWING GLASSES
COMPANY IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW.

00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:43,041
ALREADY WORTH OVER $1 BILLION.

00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:45,176
SO WHAT I WOULD OFFER --

00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:51,983
I'D SAY I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $80,000 AS A LOAN

00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:54,018
UNTIL I RECOUP $120,000,

00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:57,055
PLUS YOU GIVE ME
10% OF THE COMPANY.

00:40:57,055 --> 00:41:00,959
KEVIN JR. IN THE HOUSE!

00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,260
HE HAS LEARNED WISELY.

00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,128
HE'S GONNA GIVE YOU
THE $80,000,

00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,130
BUT THE COST BACK
IS MUCH LESS THAN ME.

00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,365
HE WANTS $120,000 BACK,

00:41:07,365 --> 00:41:10,134
BUT THE EQUITY PURCHASE AMOUNT
THAT HE WANTS IS MUCH HIGHER.

00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,035
IT'S 10%.

00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:12,236
I'M PUTTING MORE OF MY RISK

00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:14,439
IN THE COMPANY'S ABILITY
TO PAY ME BACK.

00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:16,908
I'M SAYING
I'LL GIVE YOU $80,000.

00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:17,575
I WANT $240,000 BACK.

00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:19,510
BUT YOU DON'T JUST WANT MONEY.
YOU WANT A PARTNER.

00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,612
YEAH, WE DO.
YOU NEED SOMEBODY
TO HELP YOU BUILD THIS BRAND.

00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:24,182
YEAH, 'CAUSE ALL YOU GOT TO DO
IS SELL 250K WORTH OF PRODUCT,

00:41:24,182 --> 00:41:25,383
AND YOU GET
THE SAME AMOUNT OF CASH.

00:41:25,383 --> 00:41:27,418
Don: AND WE'RE CONFIDENT
THAT WE'RE GONNA GET THERE.

00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:29,287
AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA
GET THERE NEXT YEAR.

00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:31,889
THE PROBLEM THAT I HAVE
WITH THE OFFERS RIGHT NOW

00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:32,423
IS WE DON'T DO DEBT.

00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:34,425
WE HAVE NO DEBT
ON THE COMPANY TODAY.

00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:36,227
WE WANT TO KEEP IT
THAT WAY.

00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:37,295
YOU'RE NOT A COMPANY.

00:41:37,295 --> 00:41:38,463
SEE, THEN, HE DOESN'T BELIEVE,
RIGHT?

00:41:38,463 --> 00:41:40,098
LOOK, IF YOU
BELIEVE IN THE COMPANY --

00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:41,132
WELL, THEN,
YOU DO IT, MARK.

00:41:41,132 --> 00:41:42,266
NO, LOOK,
IF YOU BELIEVE IN THE COMPANY,

00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:43,434
THEN YOU WANT THEM
TO RE-INVEST IN THE COMPANY.

00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:44,535
THEN YOU SHOULD
WRITE A CHECK.

00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:47,105
I LOVE A GUY
THAT'S WILLING TO GIVE ADVICE,

00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:48,606
BUT HE WON'T WRITE A CHECK,
ALL RIGHT?

00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:51,943
I'M WILLING TO WRITE A CHECK.
DO YOU WANT TO DO A DEAL OR NOT?

00:41:52,577 --> 00:41:56,681
YEAH. SO, AT THIS TIME,
I THINK THAT WE --

00:41:56,681 --> 00:42:00,985
I THINK THAT WE RESPECTFULLY
HAVE TO DECLINE THOSE OFFERS.

00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:03,988
YES!
YOU TOOK MY ADVICE!

00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:04,956
OKAY.

00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:05,456
CONGRATULATIONS, GUYS.

00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,258
NERDWAX GUYS,
YOU'RE DEAD TO ME.

00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:08,292
THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.

00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:10,762
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR COMPANY, GUYS.

00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,301
Don: SO, WE KNOW WE WALKED AWAY
FROM SOME MONEY TODAY,

00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:19,404
BUT LIKE MARK SAID,
WE HAVE REALLY HIGH MARGINS.

00:42:19,404 --> 00:42:21,239
IF WE GO OUT
AND WE CONTINUE TO DO

00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:22,707
WHAT WE'RE DOING,
WE'RE GONNA GET THERE.

00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:24,442
IT MAY JUST TAKE US
A LITTLE BIT LONGER,

00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:26,444
BUT WE'RE GONNA MAKE
THIS THING HAPPEN.
