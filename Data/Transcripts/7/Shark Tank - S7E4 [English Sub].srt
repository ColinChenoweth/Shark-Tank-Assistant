00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,148
THE WAY THEY'RE BUYING
OUR PRODUCT,

00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,650
IT SAYS A LOT
FOR OUR PRODUCT.

00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,985
BUT LET'S -- YO, YO, YO, YO,
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS, RIGHT?

00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:02,455
WHAT DOES IT TAKE --
I TAKE THIS BACK.

00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,624
CAN I POP IT
IN A MICROWAVE?

00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:05,926
IT'S A
FULLY-COOKED PRODUCT.

00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,727
YOU COULD TAKE THIS OUT
AND LEAVE IT ON YOUR DESK,

00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:10,196
AND IN 20 MINUTES, IT'LL BE
WARM ENOUGH TO START EATING IT.

00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,631
RIGHT.
IT'S FULLY COOKED.
YOU'RE NOT COOKING IT.

00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,400
RIGHT,
YOU'RE JUST HEATING IT.
YOU'RE JUST HEATING IT

00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,734
RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
IT'S A HEAT-AND-SERVE ITEM.

00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,169
SEE, TO ME,
THAT'S THE UPSIDE, RIGHT?

00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,939
WE'RE GOING INTO
AN ON-DEMAND ECONOMY, RIGHT?
OF COURSE.

00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,540
WHERE PEOPLE
WANT THINGS WHEN THEY WANT,

00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,841
HOW THEY WANT...
RIGHT AWAY.

00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,510
...WITH THE MOST
CONVENIENCE, RIGHT?

00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,578
JUST TAKE THESE
AND JUST CRANK 'EM OUT.

00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,580
THROW THEM IN
THE MICROWAVE -- $4.99.

00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,449
I SEE A BUSINESS THERE.

00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,084
DO YOU SELL ANYTHING
ONLINE AND SHIP?

00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:32,719
WE HAVE AN ONLINE --
WE HAVE OUR ONLINE LAUNCHING

00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,254
IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS
FROM NOW.

00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,957
WE ARE IN GOOD EGGS. WE ARE
LAUNCHING WITH FRESH DIRECT.

00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,825
AMAZON FRESH HAS
A BIG INTEREST IN US.

00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,827
THAT'S THE GOLD MINE.
OKAY, SO, LOOK AT IT THIS WAY.

00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,762
FORGET THE STORES!

00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:45,899
BE THE GODFATHER OF THIS
ON-DEMAND DELIVERY IN PIZZA.

00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,233
RIGHT.

00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,635
TRYING TO GET INTO
ALL THESE STORES

00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,870
IN THE FROZEN-FOOD SECTION
IS A BEAR.

00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,639
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE --
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING.

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,175
Herjavec: THOMAS, LOOK --
I EAT A LOT OF PIZZA.

00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:57,077
IT'S ACTUALLY
A VERY HEALTHY FOOD.

00:07:57,077 --> 00:08:01,781
UM...BRUTAL,
BRUTALLY COMPETITIVE MARKET.

00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:05,151
SOMETIMES IT'S BETTER TO BE
A BIG FISH IN A LITTLE POND.

00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,920
I THINK FOR YOU
TO TAKE AN INVESTMENT

00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,056
AND TRY TO GO AFTER
THAT MAJOR...

00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,492
SPACE IS GONNA BE
VERY DIFFICULT.

00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,960
ROBERT, WE WANT TO EXPAND.

00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,196
THE REASON WE NEED
THESE FOUR OVENS NOW

00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:19,499
IS TO SET UP POSSIBLY 5,000,
10,000 BARS IN NEW YORK CITY.

00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,634
I MEAN, IT'S ENDLESS
WHAT WE COULD DO

00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,103
ON THE HEAT-AND-SERVE END.

00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:24,604
I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT
THE SUPERMARKETS.

00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:26,339
SUPERMARKETS ARE A GREAT PLACE
TO BE IN.

00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,008
I UNDERSTAND
IT'S VERY COMPETITIVE.

00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:31,611
BUT THE BARS, THE ARENAS --
THEY'RE IN THERE HAVING A BEER.

00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:32,979
THEY WANT IT RIGHT NOW.

00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,748
I JUST SEE THAT
AS TOO RISKY.

00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,016
I'M OUT.

00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,417
THANK YOU, ROBERT.

00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:39,786
THOMAS, I GOT TO TELL YOU --
IT'S SO GOOD,

00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:43,323
BUT THERE'S NO WAY
THE IDEA'S WORTH $2 MILLION.

00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,228
I'M GONNA WAIT.
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS HERE.

00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:49,963
OH, NOW YOU'RE STEALING
ALL MY LINES.
I'M SORRY.

00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:51,498
[ CHUCKLES ]
HE CERTAINLY IS.

00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:53,099
-THAT IS MARK'S LINE.
-YEAH.
-LET ME FILL IN THE BLANKS HERE.

00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,934
WELL, TOO BAD.
IT'S MY LINE NOW.
[ LAUGHS ]

00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,103
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I LOVE
ABOUT THIS BUSINESS.

00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,172
YOU'RE THE REAL DEAL,
THE REAL PERSONALITY.

00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:00,607
EVERYBODY'S
RESPONDING TO YOU.

00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:02,409
WHO WOULD LOVE TO HANG OUT
IN YOUR KITCHEN?

00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:03,710
ALL OF US, RIGHT?
THERE YOU GO.

00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,944
YEAH.
I HAPPEN TO THINK

00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:07,313
THAT YOU'RE GOING IN
A COUPLE OF DIRECTIONS AT ONCE,

00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:09,416
AND SOME OF THEM
AREN'T SO WISE.

00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:10,550
UH-HUH.

00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,285
I DON'T EVEN THINK
YOU'RE GONNA DO SO WELL

00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,853
SELLING ONLINE
BECAUSE THERE'S --

00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,221
YOU DON'T THINK SO?

00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,257
YEAH. LET'S SAY
THAT WE DID A DEAL TOGETHER.
YEAH.

00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:19,092
YOU HAVE TO COMMIT
THAT YOU'RE ONLY GONNA SELL

00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:20,994
SINGLE SLICES.
THAT'S YOUR SWEET SPOT HERE.

00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:22,996
THAT IS. THAT IS. THAT IS
A DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH WE HAVE,

00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:24,864
I THINK,
IS THE SINGLE SLICE.
BUT HERE'S STILL
WHAT BOTHERS ME.

00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:27,400
HOW DO I KNOW WHAT'S MINE
AND WHAT'S YOURS?

00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,469
I MEAN, YOU -- YOU --
YOU'RE THE KIND OF GUY,

00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:30,603
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE AN IDEA
IN A MINUTE --

00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:31,971
"HEY, NOT ONLY THAT,
I'M GONNA DO THIS,

00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:33,873
AND NOT ONLY THAT."
NOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BARS.

00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,742
IS THAT MY BUSINESS?
IS THAT YOUR BUSINESS?

00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,077
IS THAT
YOUR PIZZA BUSINESS?

00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,411
NO, THAT -- THAT WOULD BE
A PART OF THE FROZEN BUSINESS.

00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,813
I THINK ANYTHING WE DO
UNDER THE FROZEN ROOF

00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:40,914
WOULD BE A PART OF --
PART OF THE BUSINESS.

00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,348
IT'S ALL FROZEN?
EXACTLY.

00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:43,716
MY BRICK-AND-MORTARS
ARE THERE

00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:45,985
STRICTLY TO BUILD UP
THIS PRODUCT, BUILD THE BRAND.

00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,120
YEAH.

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,688
PEOPLE COME IN, THEY GET A SLICE
OFF THE COUNTER.

00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,590
THEY KNOW THEY CAN BUY US
IN THE SUPERMARKET.

00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,325
BARBARA,
ARE YOU MAKING AN OFFER?

00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:53,560
YEAH,
I'LL MAKE AN OFFER,

00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,129
BUT I WANT A LOT MORE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:57,797
OH!

00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,608
Narrator: ONE SHARK IS OUT.

00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,244
BARBARA LIKES
THOMAS' FROZEN-PIZZA COMPANY,

00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:14,180
TABLE 87 PIZZA,
BUT SHE WANTS A BIGGER SLICE

00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,483
THAN THE 10%
HE CAME IN OFFERING.

00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:20,120
I'LL MAKE AN OFFER, BUT I WANT
A LOT MORE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,958
AS ADORABLE AS YOU ARE,
I'LL GIVE YOU $200,000 FOR 30%.

00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,893
OH!

00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:28,628
OUCH.

00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,331
-SHE'S NOT SO ADORABLE NOW.
-HE'S GOT A BABY BUSINESS.
-YEAH, OUCH.

00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:34,167
WOW, SHE TOOK A WHOLE SLICE
OUT OF YOUR PIE.

00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:36,002
[ Laughing ]
A WHOLE SLICE.

00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,071
I GOT TO TELL YOU,
I THOUGHT --
BUT I CAN MAKE YOUR PIE
A LOT BIGGER --

00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:39,873
A LOT BIGGER, FASTER.
I'LL MAKE IT INTERESTING
FOR YOU.

00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:41,207
I'LL MAKE IT INTERESTING
JUST 'CAUSE I LIKE

00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:42,542
TO MESS WITH BARBARA
A LITTLE BIT

00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:43,943
AND GIVE YOU
OTHER OPTIONS.

00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:46,179
UM...I DON'T THINK
IT IS POSSIBLE

00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,381
TO SEPARATE THE BUSINESSES
OR YOU FROM IT...
I DON'T EITHER.

00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:51,351
...BECAUSE YOU'RE THE REAL DEAL,
AND I FEEL YOUR ENERGY,

00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:54,387
AND ONE OF THE REASONS
I'M LOVING THE PIE IS THE STORY,

00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:56,122
ALL OF THAT AROUND IT.

00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,657
YOU'RE THE GUY, OKAY?

00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,958
YOU NEED CAPITAL.

00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,794
SO, I HAVE A DEAL
THAT'S VERY SIMILAR TO THIS

00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,496
CALLED
WICKED GOOD CUPCAKES,

00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,864
WHERE I OWN
NO EQUITY, ZERO.

00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,199
RIGHT.
NOTHING.

00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,668
IT'S A FAMILY BUSINESS,
AND IT'S GROWING LIKE HELL.

00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,504
THEY PAID ME BACK
THROUGH A ROYALTY, ALL RIGHT?

00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,606
IF YOU WANT TO
GO INTO A DEAL LIKE THAT,

00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:16,809
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $200,000,
AND ONLY ON THE FROZEN,

00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,978
YOU PAY ME BACK A LITTLE BIT
EVERY SLICE.

00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:21,147
I'LL GIVE YOU $200,000.

00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:23,383
WHAT CAN YOU AFFORD
TO PAY ME PER SLICE?

00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:25,752
WELL, IF I DID A ROYALTY,
IF I DECIDED TO DO A ROYALTY,

00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:27,921
I COULD PROBABLY PAY 25 CENTS
ON A SLICE.

00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:30,089
OKAY, SO LET'S SAY
IT'S 25 CENTS.

00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:34,194
AFTER I GET BACK --
BACK $600,000, WE'RE DONE.

00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,362
[ EXHALES SHARPLY ]
WOW.

00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,365
I HELPED YOU BUILD IT.
WE'RE PARTNERS.

00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,302
IF YOU STILL LOVE ME AFTER THAT,
YOU KEEP ME ON BOARD.

00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:43,870
IT'S YOUR DECISION.
THAT'S CALLED A LOAN SHARK.

00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,138
I WOULD DO THE TRADE THIS --

00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,906
I COULD PROBABLY GET THAT MONEY
ON 18th AVENUE.

00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:49,108
[ LAUGHS ]
YEAH, BUT YOU WOULDN'T --
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE ME.

00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:50,210
IT SAVES SOME MONEY.

00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,178
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE ME,
AND I THINK TWO GUYS

00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,414
WITH HAIRCUTS LIKE THIS
CAN GO A LONG WAY, BUDDY.

00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:56,449
I THINK WE COULD.
I THINK WE COULD.
I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT IT.
I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT IT.

00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,885
-ALL RIGHT.
-I THINK YOU SHOULD.
-I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT IT.
-I THINK YOU SHOULD.

00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,820
I WOULD NOT GIVE UP
30% OF YOUR BUSINESS

00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,155
TO ANY OF THESE SHARKS.
THAT'S TOO GREEDY.

00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:03,590
WELL, MAYBE LORI HAS
AN OFFER, THOMAS.

00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,891
HI, LORI.

00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:09,562
I HAVE AN OFFER, THOMAS,
BECAUSE I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.

00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,899
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU AN OFFER
YOU CAN'T REFUSE.

00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:17,503
MY OFFER'S GOING TO BE --
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU $250,000...

00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,906
Herjavec: WHOA.
...FOR 20%...

00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,043
BECAUSE I THINK
YOU'RE GONNA NEED

00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,946
A LITTLE BIT MORE MONEY
IN THE BEGINNING TO RAMP UP.

00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,648
I ALSO HAVE
A GREAT RELATIONSHIP

00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:32,452
WITH ALL THE NATURAL-FOOD CHAINS
OUT THERE.

00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:36,623
I LIKE THE SLICE, BUT
I ALSO LIKE SELLING THE PIE.

00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:39,025
I THINK THERE'S A MARKET
FOR BOTH.

00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:42,195
BUT I ALSO LIKE YOUR IDEA
OF ALSO GETTING IT OUT THERE

00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:43,663
INTO BARS
AND OTHER PLACES.

00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:45,398
IN THE VENUES.
I BELIEVE WHY NOT?

00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:46,966
IF YOU HAVE THE MANPOWER
AND THE BRAINPOWER

00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,534
AND YOU PLAN IT OUT
CORRECTLY...

00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,603
THAT'S RIGHT.
...YOU CAN HIT
ALL PLACES.

00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,838
EXACTLY.

00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:53,539
WOW, THOMAS.
SO, I REALLY
WANT IN.

00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,141
I LIKE THAT. I LIKE THAT.
THANK YOU, LORI.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:56,609
Herjavec:
WOW, SHE GAVE YOU MORE THAN
YOU WERE LOOKING FOR.

00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,078
SHE DID.
MARK, WHAT ARE YOU?
ARE YOU IN?

00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:02,148
MARK, WE ARE LAUNCHING OUR
GLUTEN-FREE PRODUCT THIS FALL,

00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:03,650
ALONG WITH
TWO OTHER PRODUCTS.

00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,718
IT'S GONNA BE
THE MUSHROOM WHITE TRUFFLE OIL

00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:07,820
AND THE
PROSCIUTTO-LACED PIE.
WOW.

00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,489
THOSE ARE OUR TWO TOP SELLERS
IN THE STORE.

00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:11,691
THIS YEAR, WE'RE GONNA BRING
$3 MILLION INTO TWO STORES.

00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:12,825
NOT BAD.

00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:16,896
YOU KNOW, I LOVE THE IDEA,
EXCEPT FOR THE STORES.

00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:19,265
OKAY.
I HATE THE IDEAS
OF THE STORES.

00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:23,736
I THINK YOUR GOLD MINE
IS THROUGH ON-DEMAND.

00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,505

RIGHT THROUGH THAT.

IT'S TRAGIC, ACTUALLY.

PROVE US ALL WRONG

AND OUR SKEPTICISM BY TELLING US
YOU HAVE LOTS OF SALES

00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:59,564
BECAUSE YOU PUT A VALUATION
ON THIS BUSINESS OF $3 MILLION.

IF YOU DON'T HAVE SALES,

00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:03,101
I'M GONNA WIPE

SO, YEAR TO DATE,
WE HAVE $300,000,

00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:08,039
BUT WE'RE PROJECTING
$1.5 MILLION FOR THIS YEAR.

00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,407
WHY?

00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:12,177
'CAUSE WE JUST LANDED
A $2- TO $3-MILLION CONTRACT

THE MOST CONSUMABLE AISLE.

WE'RE ROLLING OUT
IN 1,500 TO 2,200 STORES.

WE MAKE ABOUT 40% MARGIN
IN STORES AND 60% MARGIN ONLINE.

00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:54,352
IF I GIVE IT TO YOU?

I HAVEN'T HAD MY HUSBAND STEP
FOOT IN A TOILET-PAPER AISLE

00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:02,320
SINCE I MARRIED HIM.

00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,689
MEN DON'T SHOP FOR TOILET PAPER
FOR THE MOST PART.

THEIR WIVES DO, SO I THINK
YOU HAVE TO SELL IT TO THE WIFE.

00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:08,293
I'M NOT SURE
THEY'RE GONNA BUY IN,

THAT THE PRICE
ON THESE DUDE WIPES

00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:14,999
ARE EXACTLY DOUBLE WHAT
THEY PAID FOR THE BABY WIPES.

THAT SCARES ME.
