00:06:59,684 --> 00:07:01,319
WE'VE BEEN THERE
THE LONGEST.

00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,454
WE HAVE 350 HOMES AVAILABLE
IN SOUTH BEND.

00:07:03,454 --> 00:07:06,357
FOR BIG GAMES, WE'LL RENT OUT
80% TO 90% OF THOSE PROPERTIES.

00:07:06,357 --> 00:07:08,392
TALK ABOUT THE GROWTH
IN THOSE LISTINGS.

00:07:08,392 --> 00:07:10,394
SO, LAST YEAR, WE HAD ABOUT 200
HOMES IN SOUTH BEND.

00:07:10,394 --> 00:07:12,163
THE REALLY COOL THING
ON THE HOMEOWNER'S SIDE

00:07:12,163 --> 00:07:13,865
IS THAT PEOPLE START
TELLING THEIR FRIENDS

00:07:13,865 --> 00:07:14,832
HOW MUCH MONEY THEY MADE,

00:07:14,832 --> 00:07:16,334
THEY'RE BRAGGING
TO THEIR CO-WORKERS,

00:07:16,334 --> 00:07:18,035
AND WE'RE GETTING REFERRALS
LEFT AND RIGHT.

00:07:18,035 --> 00:07:20,404
OUR BEST HOMEOWNER
IN SOUTH BEND LAST YEAR

00:07:20,404 --> 00:07:21,839

00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:24,041
HE PULLED IN $40,000
USING OUR WEBSITE.

00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,210
WOW.
FROM HIM ALONE, WE'VE RECEIVED
DOZENS OF REFERRALS.

00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,112
AND HAVE YOU RAISED
ANY MONEY?
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

00:07:28,112 --> 00:07:30,214
DREW, HOW MUCH DEBT
DO WE HAVE ON THE COMPANY?
ZERO!

00:07:30,214 --> 00:07:31,949
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE RAISED
OUTSIDE FUNDS?

00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:33,050
ZERO!

00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,052
THIS HAS BEEN
TOTALLY BOOTSTRAPPED, GUYS.

00:07:35,052 --> 00:07:36,988
WE'RE HAVING FUN
AND WE'RE MAKING MONEY.

00:07:36,988 --> 00:07:39,056
AND MIKE, SALES THIS YEAR
ARE $1.4 MILLION.

00:07:39,056 --> 00:07:41,492
WHAT WILL THEY BE NEXT YEAR?
WHAT ARE YOU PROJECTING?

00:07:41,492 --> 00:07:42,727
SO, THAT WAS --

00:07:42,727 --> 00:07:44,762
THE $1.4 MILLION IN FEES,
THAT WAS LIFETIME, OKAY?

00:07:44,762 --> 00:07:48,699
SO, IN 2014, OUR SALES THROUGH
THE PLATFORM WERE $2.3 MILLION.

00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:51,269
WE KEPT $530,000 OF THAT
IN OUR FEES.

00:07:51,269 --> 00:07:52,603
OKAY.

00:07:52,603 --> 00:07:56,307
IN 2015, WE'LL PROCESS
$4.13 MILLION IN TRANSACTIONS.

00:07:56,307 --> 00:07:58,743
THAT WILL NET US $950,000
IN OUR FEES.

00:07:58,743 --> 00:08:00,945
YOU'RE NOT WORRIED
THAT AIRBNB SAYS, "LOOK --"

00:08:00,945 --> 00:08:02,446
THEY JUST PUT
A SEPARATE TAB.

00:08:02,446 --> 00:08:04,715
THEY'RE SAYING IF YOU'RE GOING
TO A COLLEGE GAME,

00:08:04,715 --> 00:08:06,517
THIS IS THE PLACE
TO CHECK BECAUSE --

00:08:06,517 --> 00:08:07,585
NO, AND HERE'S WHY.

00:08:07,585 --> 00:08:08,886
BECAUSE THESE HOMES
ARE HARD TO SIGN UP.

00:08:08,886 --> 00:08:10,188
YOU HAVE TO GO IN --

00:08:10,188 --> 00:08:11,923

NEVER HEARD OF THIS CONCEPT...

00:08:16,527 --> 00:08:19,463
TO WHAT SOUTH BEND IS
IN TERMS OF RABID DEMAND?

00:08:19,463 --> 00:08:22,066
THERE ARE 43 COLLEGE TOWNS
WHERE THEY AVERAGE

00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:24,735

IN ATTENDANCE.

00:08:24,735 --> 00:08:25,803
WE'RE CURRENTLY IN 20.

00:08:25,803 --> 00:08:27,305

FOR THE $200,000 INVESTMENT

THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED

00:08:29,307 --> 00:08:30,675
IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

00:08:30,675 --> 00:08:32,310
HOW DO YOU SPEND THE MONEY?
I GIVE YOU THE $200,000 --

00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,312
SO, WE SPEND THE MONEY
ON DIRECT MAIL ADVERTISING,

00:08:34,312 --> 00:08:36,714

SOMETIMES WITH RADIO ADS.

THE SURROUNDING AIR.

ON THE FLOOR OF MY APARTMENT,

I LEFT A LITTLE SPACE

00:21:36,893 --> 00:21:39,129

AND IT INSTANTLY INFLATED.

MAJOR DEFENSE CONTRACTOR.

00:34:09,946 --> 00:34:11,247
THAT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.

00:34:11,247 --> 00:34:13,149
Herjavec: ALL RIGHT,
TELL US ABOUT THE BUSINESS.

00:34:13,149 --> 00:34:14,951
SO, WE ARE A SUPPLEMENTAL
EDUCATION PROGRAM.

00:34:14,951 --> 00:34:17,820
OUR CREATIVITY CENTER
IS BASED IN POMONA, CALIFORNIA.

00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,522
WE HAVE 85 STUDENTS
AT OUR CENTER.

00:34:19,522 --> 00:34:21,457
75 OF THOSE STUDENTS
ARE YEARLY MEMBERS.

00:34:21,457 --> 00:34:22,792
FIVE OF THEM
PAY MONTHLY,

00:34:22,792 --> 00:34:25,061
AND THE REST ARE INTRODUCTORY
SIX-WEEK STUDENTS.

00:34:25,061 --> 00:34:26,596
HOW MUCH DO THEY PAY
ANNUALLY?

00:34:26,596 --> 00:34:29,365
OUR ANNUAL MEMBERSHIPS
RANGE FROM $1,400 TO $1,800

00:34:29,365 --> 00:34:30,767
DEPENDING ON THE CLASSES.

00:34:30,767 --> 00:34:32,235
DANG, $1,400?

00:34:32,235 --> 00:34:33,603
FOR A YEARLY MEMBERSHIP.

00:34:33,603 --> 00:34:35,037
WHAT'S THE MONTHLY?

00:34:35,037 --> 00:34:37,807
THEY PAY AN AVERAGE OF $135
ON A MONTHLY BASIS.

00:34:37,807 --> 00:34:39,208
IN ADDITION, WE ALSO OFFER

00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:41,410
AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS
TO LOCAL SCHOOLS.

00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:43,346
WHAT'S REVENUE GONNA BE
THIS YEAR?

00:34:43,346 --> 00:34:45,414
WE HAD $300,000 IN REVENUE
LAST YEAR.

00:34:45,414 --> 00:34:47,717
THIS WAS BROKEN
INTO TWO REVENUE STREAMS.

00:34:47,717 --> 00:34:50,653
WE HAVE OUR CREATIVITY CENTER.
THIS BROUGHT IN $130,000.

00:34:50,653 --> 00:34:53,523
IN ADDITION TO THAT, AS WE
WERE WORKING WITH STUDENTS,

00:34:53,523 --> 00:34:56,292
WE IDENTIFIED GAPS IN THE MARKET
FOR ROBOTICS TOOLS.

00:34:56,292 --> 00:34:58,594
SPECIFICALLY,
WE CREATED A ROBOTIC PRODUCT

00:34:58,594 --> 00:35:01,297
FOR UPPER MIDDLE SCHOOL
AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS.

00:35:01,297 --> 00:35:02,398
IS THAT THE BOX THERE?

00:35:02,398 --> 00:35:04,400
WE RAN KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGNS --
CORRECT --

00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,135
THAT BROUGHT IN
$170,000 IN SALES.

00:35:06,135 --> 00:35:07,470
I ACTUALLY REMEMBER THIS
FROM KICKSTARTER.

00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:08,638
-IT WAS REALLY SUCCESSFUL.
-YOU DO?

00:35:08,638 --> 00:35:09,906
Sacca: WELL,
I'M A KICKSTARTER INVESTOR,

00:35:09,906 --> 00:35:11,808
SO I PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION
TO THE STUFF

00:35:11,808 --> 00:35:14,243
THAT INFLECTS THERE,
AND THIS GOT A LOT OF ATTENTION.

00:35:14,243 --> 00:35:17,380
LOOK, I'M LOOKING AT THIS THING
WITH A LOT OF MOVING PARTS,

00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,715
A LOT OF SPOKES ON IT,
AND I DON'T THINK

00:35:19,715 --> 00:35:21,884
THE WHEEL'S TURNING YET
IN FULL CIRCLE

00:35:21,884 --> 00:35:24,086
BECAUSE YOU HAVE
A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY,

00:35:24,086 --> 00:35:27,223
AND I DON'T REALLY SEE WHAT
DIRECTION YOU'RE GONNA GO YET.

00:35:27,223 --> 00:35:30,193
I WOULD'VE PREFERRED IF THIS
HAD BEEN A LITTLE MORE GELLED

00:35:30,193 --> 00:35:32,028
SO THAT I COULD'VE SEEN
SOMETHING

00:35:32,028 --> 00:35:33,930
I COULD JUST POUR
MY GASOLINE ONTO

00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:35,932
IN THE FORM OF CAPITAL
TO EXPAND IT.

00:35:35,932 --> 00:35:37,667
I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE THERE YET.

00:35:37,667 --> 00:35:40,069
I THINK IT'S WAY TOO EARLY FOR
AN INVESTOR, AT LEAST FOR ME.

00:35:40,069 --> 00:35:41,270
I'M OUT.

00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:43,739
THANK YOU, MR. WONDERFUL,
FOR YOUR THOUGHTS.

00:35:43,739 --> 00:35:47,043
LOOK, IT MAY NOT MATTER TO THIS
SOULLESS CAPITALIST OVER HERE,

00:35:47,043 --> 00:35:49,745
BUT I'M RAISING A COUPLE OF
GIRLS, AND, YOU KNOW,

00:35:49,745 --> 00:35:52,348
I'M IN AN INDUSTRY
THAT'S JUST DOMINATED BY MEN.

00:35:52,348 --> 00:35:55,318
THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY
IS COMPLETELY DEVOID OF WOMEN.

00:35:55,318 --> 00:35:56,552
AND SO, I'M CURIOUS.

00:35:56,552 --> 00:35:59,188
I GET A HINT THAT THERE'S
SOMETHING REALLY DEEPLY

00:35:59,188 --> 00:36:01,123
MISSION-DRIVEN
BEHIND YOU GUYS.

00:36:01,123 --> 00:36:03,025
WE ARE HUGE NERDS,
AND WE ARE NERDS

00:36:03,025 --> 00:36:05,661
THAT WANT TO SHARE THAT PASSION
WITH OTHER STUDENTS.

00:36:05,661 --> 00:36:08,231
SPECIFICALLY FOR GIRLS --
YOUNG GIRLS THAT GET TOLD

00:36:08,231 --> 00:36:09,465
BEING NERDY ISN'T COOL,

00:36:09,465 --> 00:36:12,201
WE WANT TO CHANGE THAT,
AND THAT STARTS FROM THE BOTTOM.

00:36:12,201 --> 00:36:15,972
MELISSA, YOU -- YOU GUYS
ARE INCREDIBLY POLISHED,

00:36:15,972 --> 00:36:17,840
BUT I SEE A LOT OF WORK,

00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:21,577
AND I DON'T THINK IT'S AS EASY
TO SCALE AS, UH...

00:36:21,577 --> 00:36:23,012
AS I WISH IT WAS.

00:36:23,012 --> 00:36:25,948
LOOK, I'M EXCITED
ABOUT YOU GUYS.

00:36:25,948 --> 00:36:29,318
I'M NOT AS EXCITED
ABOUT THE BUSINESS.

00:36:29,318 --> 00:36:30,386
I'M OUT.

00:36:30,386 --> 00:36:31,287
THANK YOU.

00:36:31,287 --> 00:36:33,022
Cuban:
GUYS, YOU WANT TO GROW,

00:36:33,022 --> 00:36:35,191
AND YOU HAVE
THIS MAGNIFICENT GOAL.

00:36:35,191 --> 00:36:39,028
BUT YOU'RE -- YOU'RE A LITTLE
BIT TOO OPEN-ENDED FOR ME.

00:36:39,028 --> 00:36:41,831
I THINK TAKING THOSE FIRST STEPS
ARE GONNA BE VERY DIFFICULT

00:36:41,831 --> 00:36:43,532
AND REQUIRE
A LOT OF HAND-HOLDING.

00:36:43,532 --> 00:36:45,334
I STILL THINK
YOU'LL BE SUCCESSFUL.

00:36:45,334 --> 00:36:47,536
I JUST DON'T THINK
IT'S THE RIGHT FIT FOR ME,

00:36:47,536 --> 00:36:49,105
SO FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.

00:36:49,105 --> 00:36:51,641
THANK YOU, MR. CUBAN.

00:36:51,641 --> 00:36:52,842
YOU STILL HAVE TWO SHARKS.

00:36:52,842 --> 00:36:54,644
YOU'VE GOT LORI
AND YOU'VE GOT CHRIS.

00:36:54,644 --> 00:36:59,148
FOR ME, I THINK
A LOT OF THE CHALLENGES HERE

00:36:59,148 --> 00:37:00,917
REALLY GO BACK
TO VALUATION,

00:37:00,917 --> 00:37:03,286
BECAUSE THIS IS A BUSINESS
THAT DOESN'T HAVE

00:37:03,286 --> 00:37:05,488
THE TRADITIONAL SCALE
OF A TECH COMPANY.

00:37:05,488 --> 00:37:07,690
THAT SAID, I DEEPLY
BELIEVE IN YOUR MISSION.

00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:10,326
I THINK SCHOOLS ARE GONNA
START WAKING UP AND REALIZING

00:37:10,326 --> 00:37:12,261
THEY NEED MORE OF THIS
IN THE SCHOOLS.

00:37:12,261 --> 00:37:13,863
THEY'RE GONNA BE
REACHING OUT TO YOU.

00:37:13,863 --> 00:37:15,765
THERE IS A BIG THIRST
FOR MATERIALS LIKE THIS.

00:37:15,765 --> 00:37:17,900
SO, WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO

00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:21,771
IS OFFER YOU 150K
FOR 25% OF THE COMPANY.

00:37:21,771 --> 00:37:24,440
I DO HAVE THE UTMOST RESPECT
FOR THAT OFFER

00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,942
AND WE DO APPRECIATE IT,

00:37:25,942 --> 00:37:28,110
AND WE WOULD LOVE
TO CONSIDER IT.

00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,545
WE DO BELIEVE --

00:37:29,545 --> 00:37:30,713
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:37:30,713 --> 00:37:32,081
WOW. [ LAUGHS ]

00:37:32,081 --> 00:37:34,317
MELISSA, DO YOU NEED
TO CONSIDER IT?

00:37:34,317 --> 00:37:37,887
WE DO BELIEVE THAT
A $1 MILLION VALUATION IS FAIR.

00:37:37,887 --> 00:37:39,689
SO, HOW DO I GET
THAT MONEY BACK, THEN?

00:37:39,689 --> 00:37:42,091
WHEN IS THIS THING -- YOU KNOW,
ARE YOU GONNA SELL THIS?

00:37:42,091 --> 00:37:44,427
DOES IT GET BOUGHT BY --
BY SOME MASSIVE CONGLOMERATE?

00:37:44,427 --> 00:37:46,262
I MEAN, WHERE DO WE GET
THAT MONEY BACK?

00:37:46,262 --> 00:37:49,565
SO, OUR PROJECTIONS
FOR THIS YEAR IS $450,000.

00:37:49,565 --> 00:37:51,300
FOR OUR 2016 PROJECTION,

00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,270
WE ARE LOOKING
AT $3.2 MILLION IN SALES.

00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:56,839
SO, IF YOU'RE INVESTING
$150,000 FOR 25%,

00:37:56,839 --> 00:37:59,842
YOU WANT YOUR $150,000 BACK
WITHIN A YEAR OR TWO.

00:37:59,842 --> 00:38:02,244
-AND SO, IF YOU --
-NOT NECESSARILY.

00:38:02,244 --> 00:38:04,347
I MEAN, I'VE OWNED TWITTER STOCK
SINCE 2007

00:38:04,347 --> 00:38:06,949
AND IT TURNS OUT IT'S GONE UP
A LOT SINCE I INVESTED.

00:38:06,949 --> 00:38:08,484
I'VE OWNED UBER STOCK
SINCE 2009.

00:38:08,484 --> 00:38:09,752
THAT'S GONE UP A LOT.

00:38:09,752 --> 00:38:12,021
I DON'T NEED MY MONEY BACK
IN A YEAR AND A HALF.

00:38:12,021 --> 00:38:13,255
I HAVE THE MONEY TO SPARE.

00:38:13,255 --> 00:38:14,790
THAT SAID, I WANT TO KNOW

00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:17,460
WHAT THE TERMINAL EVENT IS
FOR THIS COMPANY.

00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,195
I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT THE EXIT IS.

00:38:19,195 --> 00:38:21,597
THERE ARE CERTAIN FOUNDERS
WHO WILL NEVER SELL,

00:38:21,597 --> 00:38:22,898
AND AS AN EQUITY INVESTOR,

00:38:22,898 --> 00:38:24,834
THAT'S A BUMMER
BECAUSE I WANT TO GET

00:38:24,834 --> 00:38:26,869
THAT MONEY BACK
AND MORE AT SOME POINT.

00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:29,238
OUR VISION
IN TERMS OF THE BUSINESS ITSELF

00:38:29,238 --> 00:38:31,607
IS TO HAVE A S.T.E.M. CENTER
IN EVERY CITY.

00:38:31,607 --> 00:38:33,976
AS WE GROW,
IF WE ARE ABLE TO FIND SOMEONE

00:38:33,976 --> 00:38:36,145
WHO'S INTERESTED
TO TAKE THAT FORWARD,

00:38:36,145 --> 00:38:37,780
ABSOLUTELY
WE WOULD BE INTERESTED.

00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:40,149
Herjavec: MELISSA, DO YOU HAVE
A COUNTER FOR CHRIS?

00:38:40,149 --> 00:38:42,151
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SHARE.

00:38:50,459 --> 00:38:53,162
Narrator:
THREE SHARKS ARE OUT.

00:38:53,162 --> 00:38:56,532
CHRIS HAS MADE AN OFFER,
BUT LORI MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED

00:38:56,532 --> 00:38:58,067
IN MELISSA AND LAVANYA'S

00:38:58,067 --> 00:39:00,803
SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY,
ENGINEERING, AND MATH

00:39:00,803 --> 00:39:03,305
EDUCATION COMPANY,
S.T.E.M. CENTER USA.

00:39:03,305 --> 00:39:04,874
Herjavec: MELISSA, DO YOU HAVE
A COUNTER FOR CHRIS?

00:39:04,874 --> 00:39:07,510
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SHARE.

00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,744
HERE'S THE THING.

00:39:08,744 --> 00:39:10,813
I'D LIKE TO HEAR A COUNTER
BECAUSE I LOVE LORI,

00:39:10,813 --> 00:39:13,682
AND I HAVE DEEP RESPECT FOR HER
QVC AND RETAIL CONNECTIONS,

00:39:13,682 --> 00:39:15,985
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.

00:39:15,985 --> 00:39:17,586
AND SO, I THINK I HAVE
A UNIQUE SKILL SET

00:39:17,586 --> 00:39:18,988
TO BRING TO THE TABLE
WITH YOU GUYS,

00:39:18,988 --> 00:39:20,956
AND SO I'D LOVE TO HEAR
WHAT YOU'RE COMING BACK WITH.

00:39:20,956 --> 00:39:22,725
-I JUST WANT TO SHARE SOMETHING.
-OH, COME ON.

00:39:22,725 --> 00:39:24,693
A PERSONAL ANECDOTE ABOUT
WHAT S.T.E.M. MEANS TO YOU?

00:39:24,693 --> 00:39:26,328
-'CAUSE I WOULD LISTEN TO THAT.
-[ LAUGHS ]

00:39:26,328 --> 00:39:27,496
I'D LISTEN TO THAT.

00:39:27,496 --> 00:39:29,265
ABOUT A ROBOT YOU BUILT
WHEN YOU WERE 8 YEARS OLD?

00:39:29,265 --> 00:39:31,333
-I WOULD TOTALLY HEAR THAT OUT.
-JUST LIKE KEVIN...

00:39:31,333 --> 00:39:32,601
-OH, MY GOODNESS.
-COME ON.

00:39:32,601 --> 00:39:34,203
JUST LIKE KEVIN,

00:39:34,203 --> 00:39:38,641
I'M PART OF A VERY EXCLUSIVE
AND PRESTIGIOUS CLUB.

00:39:38,641 --> 00:39:39,942
I'M A WOMAN.

00:39:39,942 --> 00:39:43,045
I SEE IN YOU GUYS SOMETHING
THAT I THINK

00:39:43,045 --> 00:39:45,915
IS REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT
TO WOMEN.

00:39:45,915 --> 00:39:50,086
I THINK BOTH OF YOU
ARE EXTREMELY IMPRESSIVE.

00:39:50,086 --> 00:39:52,988
I LIKE WHAT YOU'RE DOING,
I LIKE THE CONCEPT,

00:39:52,988 --> 00:39:55,791
AND I LIKE WHAT IT WILL DO
FOR YOUNG WOMEN.

00:39:55,791 --> 00:39:57,993
SO, I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER,

00:39:57,993 --> 00:40:00,629
BECAUSE I THINK
THE THREE OF US TOGETHER

00:40:00,629 --> 00:40:02,498
WILL BE VERY, VERY SUCCESSFUL.

00:40:02,498 --> 00:40:06,769
I'M GONNA OFFER YOU
$150,000 FOR 20%.

00:40:06,769 --> 00:40:08,804
THANK YOU SO MUCH,
MS. GREINER.

00:40:08,804 --> 00:40:11,774
IT'S A PLEASURE TO GET AN OFFER
FROM YOU, AS WELL.

00:40:11,774 --> 00:40:15,344
WE ARE HERE
TO GROW OUR BUSINESS, AND --

00:40:15,344 --> 00:40:16,979
WHAT PROBLEM
ARE YOU TRYING TO SOLVE?

00:40:16,979 --> 00:40:18,314
WHAT DO YOU NEED
FROM A SHARK?

00:40:18,314 --> 00:40:20,549
WE NEED ASSISTANCE
IN EXPANDING THE CENTER

00:40:20,549 --> 00:40:21,617
THROUGH FRANCHISE,

00:40:21,617 --> 00:40:23,419
AND WE NEED
THAT CAPITAL INVESTMENT

00:40:23,419 --> 00:40:26,188
TO DO THE DOCUMENTATION
TO TAKE THIS TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

00:40:26,188 --> 00:40:28,991
THAT'S WHAT'S RESTRICTING US
FROM DUPLICATING CURRENTLY.

00:40:28,991 --> 00:40:32,128
SO, WHAT I DIDN'T HEAR YOU SAY
IS, "I NEED A SPOT ON QVC.

00:40:32,128 --> 00:40:33,395
I NEED AN INFOMERCIAL.

00:40:33,395 --> 00:40:35,865
I NEED AN END CAP
AT A BED, BATH &amp; BEYOND."

00:40:35,865 --> 00:40:38,100
THAT'S NOT ALL THAT I DO.
THAT'S CRAZY.

00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,835
YOU GUYS KNOW THAT.
YOU'VE DONE YOUR HOMEWORK.

00:40:39,835 --> 00:40:41,804
Melissa: BOTH OF YOU OFFER
A LOT OF WONDERFUL THINGS.

00:40:41,804 --> 00:40:43,739
WE HAVE A PRODUCT LINE,
WE HAVE A CENTER.

00:40:43,739 --> 00:40:45,074
WE ARE WORKING TO EXPAND BOTH,

00:40:45,074 --> 00:40:47,343
AND I KNOW THAT BOTH OF YOU
CAN HELP US WITH THAT.

00:40:47,343 --> 00:40:49,478
WHAT WE'D LOVE TO DO
IS WORK WITH BOTH OF YOU.

00:40:52,648 --> 00:40:56,152
I'M WILLING TO SHARE BECAUSE
I SEE MERIT TO BOTH OF US.

00:40:56,152 --> 00:40:58,053
I SEE
WHERE I CAN TAKE IT,

00:40:58,053 --> 00:41:00,055
BUT I ALSO THINK
THAT CHRIS CAN BRING MERIT.

00:41:00,055 --> 00:41:02,191
IF CHRIS IS WILLING
TO ACCEPT MY HAND BACK IN.

00:41:02,191 --> 00:41:03,592
LOOK,
YOU'RE WILLING TO SHARE

00:41:03,592 --> 00:41:05,494
BECAUSE YOU'RE SWIMMING
