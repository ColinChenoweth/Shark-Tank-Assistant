THIS IS THE SHARK TANK...

00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,272
WHERE ENTREPRENEURS
SEEK AN INVESTMENT

00:00:05,272 --> 00:00:08,408
TO START, GROW,
OR SAVE THEIR BUSINESSES.

00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:11,311

Narrator: IF THE SHARKS
HEAR A GREAT IDEA...

00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,715
OH, MY GOD.
I LOVE THAT.

00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:16,650
Narrator: ...THEY'LL INVEST
THEIR OWN MONEY...

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,052
I'LL GIVE YOU $250,000 FOR 30%.

00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:21,088

EACH OTHER FOR A DEAL.

00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:22,723
NOW, BARBARA,
I'M COUNTING ON YOU.

00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:24,191
JUST BEFORE
YOU START PITCHING HER,

00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,193
I'M GONNA TELL YOU,
SHE'S REALLY BAD WITH NUMBERS.

00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,161
-KEVIN, THAT'S SO RIDICULOUS.
-HE'S SO RUDE.

00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:29,296
I'M NOT RUDE.

00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:30,764
Narrator:
THE ENTREPRENEURS MUST GET

00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:32,165
THE FULL AMOUNT
THEY'RE ASKING FOR,

00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:33,567
OR THEY'LL WALK AWAY
WITH NOTHING.

00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:35,269
THEY WILL BET
ON WHO WE ARE.

00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:36,870
KUMBAYA. WHO CARES?

00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,438
DO YOU HAVE DEBT
ON THE COMPANY?

00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:39,840
$130K.

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,142
OKAY, YOUR COMPANY
HAS CURRENTLY NO VALUE AT ALL.

00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:48,448
Narrator:
WHO ARE THE SHARKS?

00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:53,453
THEY'RE SELF-MADE BUSINESS
EXPERTS WORTH BILLIONS.

00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:56,690
KEVIN O'LEARY IS
A SHREWD VENTURE CAPITALIST

00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,893
WHO MADE HIS FORTUNE SELLING
A CHILDREN'S EDUCATIONAL COMPANY

00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,496
FOR OVER $4 BILLION.

00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:06,366
BARBARA CORCORAN WENT FROM
WAITING TABLES IN MANHATTAN

00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:10,771

♪♪

00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:59,152
HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS GABE WOLFF.

00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:01,622
I'M ANI BLINOVA, AND WE'RE
FROM STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT.

00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,090
OUR COMPANY
IS WINK FROZEN DESSERTS,

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,758
AND WE'RE SEEKING $300,000

00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:08,161
IN EXCHANGE FOR 15% EQUITY
IN OUR COMPANY.

00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,864
ICE CREAM -- IT'S A M--
IT'S -- I --

00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:11,765
-YES, IT IS.
-IT IS.

00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:13,000
EASY TO SAY.

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,935
ICE CREAM -- IT'S AMERICA'S
FAVORITE DESSERT,

00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:17,671
BUT LET'S FACE IT --
IT'S SO BAD FOR YOU.

00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:19,640
BUT GOING COLD TURKEY
ON THIS FROZEN TREAT

00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,475
IS A LOT MORE DIFFICULT
THAN IT SOUNDS.

00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,144
AS AN ICE CREAM ADDICT MYSELF
WHO'S VERY HEALTH-CONSCIOUS,

00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,046
I DECIDED TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT,

00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:28,215
SO I WENT INTO THE KITCHEN
AND PLAYED MAD SCIENTIST

00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:30,917
TO CREATE MY OWN HEALTHY,
ALL-NATURAL FROZEN TREAT.

00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,252

IT'S FREE OF ALL
THE TOP 8 ALLERGENS

00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,426
AND, MY PERSONAL
FAVORITE PART,

00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:41,161
WEIGHS IN
AT ONLY 100 CALORIES...

00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,529
Together:
FOR THE ENTIRE PINT!

00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,498
MOST IMPORTANTLY,
WE DO ALL THIS BY USING...

00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,767
WHAT?!
...NATURAL, NON-GENETICALLY
MODIFIED INGREDIENTS

00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,502
WHILE STILL DELIVERING
ON SWEETNESS AND FLAVOR.

00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,371
SHARKS, WITH WINK, YOU WON'T
EVEN MISS REGULAR ICE CREAM.

00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:52,906
WE'VE CREATED
A DELICIOUS TREAT

00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,675
THAT SATISFIES
ALMOST ANY SWEET TOOTH,

00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:55,976
BUT NEED YOUR HELP
IN ORDER

00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:57,577
TO BRING WINK
TO THE NATIONAL STAGE.

00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,880
SO, SHARKS, NOW IT'S YOUR TURN
TO TRY THE HEALTHIEST...

00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,049
AND TASTIEST.
...THING TO EVER HAPPEN
TO ICE CREAM.

00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:03,550
Together: WINK!

00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,785
-CAN WE TRY IT?
-OF COURSE.

00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:06,520
-ABSOLUTELY.
-GABE, I HAVE BAD NEWS FOR YOU.

00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,655
-YEAH?
-I AM AN ICE CREAM EXPERT.

00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:09,656
-UH-OH.
-UH-OH.

00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:10,924
NOBODY EATS MORE
ICE CREAM THAN ME.

00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,292
I LOVE THE STUFF.

00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,960
Blinova: WELL,
IT'S DEFINITELY DIFFERENT.

00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,929
WE'VE INDIVIDUALIZED
EACH SUNDAE IN THE MIDDLE.

00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:19,032
OH, THANK YOU.
IT'S VANILLA WITH MAPLE PECAN
GRANOLA AND SOME CHERRIES.

00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,135
WOW, WE'RE IN
FOR SOME GOOD STUFF.
LORI, THIS IS FOR YOU.

00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:24,204
IT IS OUR CAKE BATTER,
MY PERSONAL FAVORITE FLAVOR...

00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,739
-THANK YOU.
-...WITH STRAWBERRIES

00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,108
AND DAIRY-FREE AND ALLERGEN-FREE
CHOCOLATE CHIPS.

00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:30,243
Wolff:
IN THE MIDDLE IS THE SUNDAE,

00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,912
AND RIGHT ON THE PERIMETER
OF YOUR SUNDAE,

00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:33,313
YOU HAVE A SAMPLE
OF EACH FLAVOR.

00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,881
SO WE HAVE SIX FLAVORS.

00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,384
OUR FIRST FLAVOR
IS CAKE BATTER.

00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,186
IT'S A GLUTEN-FREE
CAKE BATTER,

00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:42,456
SO THERE IS NO OTHER GLUTEN-FREE
CAKE BATTER ON THE MARKET YET.

00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:43,724
THEN WE HAVE COCOA DOUGH,

00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,792
WHICH IS LIKE
A CHOCOLATY COOKIE DOUGH.

00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,195
THEN WE DO CINNAMON BUN,
ICED LATTE,

00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:50,931
AND CHOCO-MINT,
AND THEN VANILLA BEAN.

00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,802
WHAT IS
THE SUBSTITUTE SUGAR?

00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:58,872
WE USE ORGANIC STEVIA
AND MONK FRUIT TO SWEETEN IT.

00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:02,976
IT TASTES KIND OF, YOU KNOW,
IN THE MIDDLE.

00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,544
MM-HMM.
THAT'S WHY WE DO THE SUNDAES,

00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,546
TO ADD A LITTLE BIT
OF FLAVOR TO IT AND SO
YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE IT.

00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,181
I-I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY IT...
NO, THAT'S FINE.
YOU CAN SAY IT.

00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:09,483
...BUT IT TASTES KIND OF BLAND
ON ITS OWN.

00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:10,917
YEAH, IT'S NOT A PRODUCT
THAT'S MEANT TO HIT A HOME RUN

00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,285
WITH EVERY SINGLE PERSON
WHO TRIES IT.
YEAH.

00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:14,321
IS IT A PRODUCT THAT'S MEANT
TO BE EATEN ON ITS OWN,

00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:16,123
OR DO YOU SEE IT
AS A MIXER WITH SOMETHING?
YEP.

00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:17,557
WELL, WE HAVE CUSTOMERS
THAT DO BOTH.

00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,559
I, PERSONALLY, LOVE TO EAT THE
CAKE BATTER ON -- ON ITS OWN.

00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:22,596
O'Leary: BUT, ANI, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO BE 100 CALORIES.

00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:26,233
YOU COULD BE 200 CALORIES
AND STILL BE 50% LESS

00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:28,001
THAN MOST ICE CREAMS MADE
WITH MILK FAT.

00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:31,905
IS THAT TRUE? IS THE AVERAGE TUB
OF THAT SIZE 500 CALORIES?
600 CALORIES.

00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:33,240
-YEAH.
-YEAH.
-SO, WOW!

00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,076
SO DID YOU TEST GOING
TO 200 CALORIES TO SEE

00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:38,011
IF IT -- IT MADE THE BASE
PRODUCT MORE INTERESTING?
SURE.

00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,213
YEAH, AND WHAT IT DOES --
YOU GET MORE OF THE FLAVOR,

00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:42,315
BUT YOU DO END UP
ADDING A COUPLE GRAMS OF FAT

00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:44,384
OR LIKE 1 GRAM OF SUGAR.

00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,119
WELL, WHAT DO SALES SAY?

00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,721
I MEAN, IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT I PERSONALLY THINK.
YEAH, HOW MUCH HAVE YOU SOLD?

00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,256
-IT MATTERS WHAT SALES ARE.
-SO -- ABSOLUTELY.

00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:53,126
SO, TO DATE,
WE'VE SOLD $534,000 WORTH.

00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,530
-OVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME?
-THREE YEARS, UM...

00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,098
OHH.

00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:00,700
AND HOW
DO YOU SELL IT?

00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,670
WE STARTED WITH AN ONLINE STORE,
GOING DIRECT TO CONSUMER.

00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,272
Blinova:
WE'RE IN SEVERAL RETAILERS

00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:07,274
AROUND OUR AREA
IN THE NORTHEAST.

00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:08,642
SO WE'RE IN WHOLE FOODS.

00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,076
YOGURTS --
HOW MANY WHOLE FOODS
ARE YOU IN?

00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,244
-30.
-30.

00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,280
WHAT IS THE SUBSTANCE
THAT THIS IS MADE OUT OF?

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,714
SO, THE BASE IS PEA PROTEIN,

00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,783
SO IT'S A VEGETABLE
PROTEIN-BASED NON-GMO.
PEA PROTEIN.

00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:18,685
GABE, I WAS CURIOUS --
YOU WERE TELLING US YOUR STORY,

00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,053
AND YOU SAID YOU
JUST WENT IN THE KITCHEN...

00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,288
-YEAH.
-...AND MADE THE ICE CREAM.

00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:22,589
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,925
SO, GROWING UP,
I WAS THE CHUBBY KID IN SCHOOL.

00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,293
YOU WERE?
YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD.
I GOT PICKED ON A LOT.

00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:27,561
-THANK YOU.
-[ LAUGHS ]

00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:28,962
-BARBARA, LEAVE HIM ALONE.
-YOU'D NEVER KNOW IT.

00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,097
SO, MY WHOLE
ENTIRE FAMILY STRUGGLED

00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:33,099
WITH DIABETES, WITH OBESITY.

00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:35,468
AND THEN WHEN I TURNED 17,
I WAS DIAGNOSED

00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,838
WITH CELIAC DISEASE
AND A DAIRY INTOLERANCE,

00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:41,241
SO IT DRASTICALLY CHANGED
THE WAY I HAD TO EAT.

00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:43,076
AND THIS IS A FULL-TIME JOB
FOR BOTH OF YOU?

00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,544
-YES.
-NOW IT IS, YES.
-YEAH.

00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:45,912
HOW MUCH DID YOU
MAKE LAST YEAR?

00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,747
THE COMPANY
LOST MONEY LAST YEAR...

00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:49,850
YEAH.
...BUT GROSS PROFIT
WAS ABOUT $87,000.

00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,284
AND WHERE'S
THE BREAK-EVEN POINT?

00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:54,221
WE'RE ACTUALLY PROJECTED
TO MAKE $650,000 THIS YEAR.
YEP.

00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:56,656
WHY A SUDDEN CHANGE? IT SOUNDS
LIKE IT'S A BIG LEAP HERE.

00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,925
WE HAVE ABOUT 180 STORES
THAT ARE COMING ON.

00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,628
THE REASON THERE WAS
SUCH A LOSS LAST YEAR

00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:04,030
WAS BECAUSE WE HAD PROBLEMS
WITH THE CO-PACKER.

00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,765
WE HAD THEIR FREEZER
BREAKING DOWN.

00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:08,535
WE LOST ABOUT $60,000
WORTH OF PRODUCT.
OUCH.

00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,136
-OKAY, THAT'S WHY.
-RIGHT AT ICE CREAM SEASON.

00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,805
LIKE, THE NUMBERS
JUST DIDN'T ADD UP --
I HAVE A QUESTION.

00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:13,406
GUYS, I'M NOT CRAZY
ABOUT YOUR PRODUCT,

00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:15,208
AND PERHAPS
I LACK APPRECIATION,

00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,810
BUT I DIDN'T FIND
IT HAD ANY TASTE

00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,212
UNTIL I BIT
INTO YOUR TRIMMINGS THERE.

00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,115
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY
THAN THE TASTE, FOR ME,

00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,784
I LOVE TO BUY A BUSINESS
THAT'S ON THE WINNING SIDE.

00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:26,887
EVERYBODY LOVES A WINNER,
ESPECIALLY INVESTORS.

00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,522
I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR
BETTER FOR YOU TO COME IN HERE

00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,391
AFTER YOU'D TURNED THE CORNER
OF A PROFIT OF SOME KIND.

00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,525
-SURE.
-SURE.

00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:35,528
SO BECAUSE OF THE TIMING
OF YOUR PITCH, I'M OUT.

00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,697
-OKAY, THANK VERY MUCH.
-THANK YOU.

00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:39,966
I WOULD -- I WOULD LIKE
TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE
CONCERNS THAT YOU VOICED.

00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,034
FINE -- FOR THE OTHER SHARKS,
CERTAINLY.

I MEAN, THERE'S NO --

00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,507
THE RENT IN NEW YORK
IS ASTRONOMICAL,

00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:55,080
AND THEN THEY RAISE THE RENT,
AND THAT'S IT.
YES.

00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,782
OH, SO YOU THINK IT HELPS

DO YOU FIND THAT'S TRUE?

00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:01,853
IF A BUILDING
HAD THIS IN IT...

00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:04,089
Corcoran: WELL, THE -- THE --
WOULD YOU PAY $7,000
AS A LANDLORD?

00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:05,857
THE REASON A BUILDING
WITHOUT A DOORMAN

00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:07,359
CAN'T COMMAND IN THE RENT
THAT THEY SHOULD --

00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,828
SAME SQUARE FOOTAGE,
SAME VIEW, SAME AMENITIES --

00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:11,763
BUT THEY CAN'T CHARGE
WHAT THEY WANT

00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:13,598
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE
A DOORMAN.

00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:15,634

NOT TOTALLY,
BUT I GET IT.

THE SPACE FOR THIS.

AND THEN YOU HAVE THE SWEET SPOT
THAT'S PERFECT FOR YOU --

00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:26,825
THE UNITS
THAT HAVE 60, 80, 100 UNITS,

AND THEY DON'T HAVE DOORMEN --
THEY DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR IT.

00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,762

FOR THEIR RENT

00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:32,630

IN THERE, OKAY?

EXACTLY.
SO TELL US
HOW MANY SALES YOU HAVE.

00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,066
YEAH, AND -- AND WE LAUNCHED
ABOUT 18 MONTHS AGO.

00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:08,205
WE HAVE SOLD OVER 15,700 BOARDS,
GROSSED $575,000.

00:35:08,205 --> 00:35:10,674
-GOOD FOR YOU.
-HOW MUCH DOES THE BOARD COST?

00:35:10,674 --> 00:35:11,942
$45 RETAIL ONLINE.

00:35:11,942 --> 00:35:14,245
SO IT COSTS YOU
HOW MUCH TO MAKE?

00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:15,713
$9.87.

00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:17,081
-WOW!
-YEAH.

00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:18,616
IT'S ACTUALLY THE CHEAPEST
BALANCE BOARD ON THE MARKET.

00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:19,917
AND DO YOU SELL IT --
DO YOU SELL IT --

00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:22,253
WE SELL IT
AT CONSUMER SHOWS, MAINLY,

00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:24,355
AND THEN ONLINE ON OUR WEBSITE.

AND IF THERE ARE,
WHAT ARE THEY LIKE?

00:35:33,597 --> 00:35:35,199
I JUST MET WITH
A LARGE SPORTING GOODS STORE,

00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:37,067
AND SHE SAID, "I'M PITCHED
BALANCE BOARDS ALL THE TIME.

00:35:37,067 --> 00:35:38,235
THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME."

00:35:38,235 --> 00:35:40,271
AND THEY'RE BASICALLY
A WOODEN PLANK

00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:41,539
WITH A CYLINDER UNDERNEATH.

00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:43,073
SHE LOVED THE PRODUCT.

00:35:43,073 --> 00:35:44,308
SHE WAS THE ONE WHO SAID,

00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,343
"WE GET PITCHED ALL THE TIME
ON BALANCE BOARDS.

00:35:46,343 --> 00:35:47,478
YOURS LOOKS SO DIFFERENT."

00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:50,014

CAN YOU BE COPIED?

00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:51,348
YOU <i>WILL</i> BE COPIED.
-YES.

00:35:51,348 --> 00:35:53,384
-RIGHT.

00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:54,785

-YEAH, YES.
