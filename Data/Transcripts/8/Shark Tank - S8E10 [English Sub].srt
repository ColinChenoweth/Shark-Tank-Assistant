incredible success

from humble beginnings

to build business empires
from nothing into billions.

00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,630
This is the highest valuation
we've ever had on "Shark Tank."

00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,566
We've never had any company
for $40 million.

It scares the hell
out of me.

You've got the most valuable
prime time airtime in the world

of doing business.

that answer.

Narrator:
This is "Shark Tank."

00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:56,323
The best deals are ones
where you squirm a little bit.

Hi, Sharks.

[ Chuckles ]

00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:31,658
Sharks, let's face it.

00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:34,428
Getting around urban areas ‐‐
It sucks!

00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,530
Jam‐packed in
a crowded public transportation

00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,599
or stuck in gridlock
on your drive home,

00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,500
and just when you think you've
beaten the system

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,768
by riding a bike to work,

00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:45,072
you show up looking like
a hot, sweaty mess.

00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:47,274
Our solution is the M1.

00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,376
The M1 is
an electric skateboard

00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,244
that goes
up to 20 miles an hour

00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:54,381
and has a range
of 7 to 10 miles.

00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:56,383
We've integrated headlights
and taillights

00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:58,318
so you're safe
when you ride at night.

00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:59,720
Our in‐wheel
motor technology...

00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,691
no gears,
and requires no maintenance.

00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:08,362
All this while looking and
feeling like a real skateboard.

00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:11,131
At 14 pounds,
you can easily carry the M1

00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,466
into a crowded elevator,

00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,533
and I think
we can all agree

00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,702
that parking is not
gonna be a problem.

Sharks, we're on the verge
of a transportation revolution.

00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:21,742
Riding the M1 can turn
your commute into a fun, easy,

00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:24,378
and exciting experience,
and all for less than the cost

00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:25,612

with Inboard?

And more importantly, who wants
to come up and try the M1?

All right.

00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:40,494
So it's really easy
to use.
All right.

00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:41,528
The big thing is that
you've got

00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,230
four contact points
with the ground.

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,431

This is the safety.
So, you hold this to engage.

It's just forward to go forward
and back to go back.

00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:57,477
So, I can't move it
unless I'm pushing this, right?

Exactly.
There we go.

I'm pretty sure there's other
electric skateboards out there.

Ryan:
Yeah, that's correct.
Why is yours unique?

00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:28,675
The fact that we created
the first ever in‐wheel motor.

00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,077
It's actually
one of the smallest

00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:30,844
hub motors ever created.

00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:33,413
The way we integrated
the battery into the deck.

00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:34,614
But, really,
the biggest difference

00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,316
between us
and our competitors

00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:37,751
is the way
that we designed our company.

00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,920
From inception,
we've focused on scalability,

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,322

and high‐volume distribution.

after our last round.

it can go uphill?

00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:54,668
Yes.

00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:55,802
And going downhill,
what happens?

00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:58,138
It actually ‐‐ It brakes,
and it charges the battery

00:03:58,138 --> 00:03:58,772
while you brake.

00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:00,807
The greatest thing about
the in‐wheel motor technology ‐‐

00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:03,310
If you look at any of
our competitors on the market,

00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,545
they all use an external motor
that sits outside

00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:08,115
and then ultimately,
a gear and a belt system

00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:09,216
that drives the motor.

00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:10,250

it's a skateboard.

because you have to

00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:29,236
dig out of snow half the year,
but here in California,

00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:30,370
it's happening at scale.

I actually do see them
as a vehicle or as a tool.

00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:34,574
Yeah, but when Chris
talks about scale, he's wrong.

00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:38,211
Just because you see individuals
driving around on skateboards

00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,479
doesn't mean it's scale.

What does it cost?

00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,331
The retail price
is $1,399.

00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,566
And what does it cost
to make?

00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:02,369
We have have
a direct margin of 65%.

00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:05,305
How many people
can afford $1,400?

00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,474
The self‐balancing boards,
when they first came out,

00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,676
were 1,500 bucks, and they ‐‐
they sold hundreds of thousands.

a better way.

gonna scale?

different beast.

00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:19,719
is completely different
than the Hoverboard

'cause one is a lot easier
to balance on.

and backwards.

Because not only have I seen
all the YouTube videos,

One is to get around
your neighborhood, have fun.

modes of transportation

00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,340
Right.
For sure.

00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,441

they sold more.

to get to work ‐‐

00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:33,593
I'm taking 2.5% equity
as a kicker.

00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,428
Haley: What I'd like to do is
first explain

00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,564
the difference in valuation from
the last round to now.

00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:38,632
Fair.
You can do that.

00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:40,267
But no one's beaten you up
on that yet.

00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:41,268
I was gonna
do that work later.

00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:42,302
Right. Yeah,
I figured that much,

00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:43,637
so I'm just gonna
kind of pre‐empt it.
Thank you. Yeah.

00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:44,704
So, since
the last round,

00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:47,173
we've de‐risked the company
considerably.

00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:50,477
Um, we, uh...

00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:51,678
Like I said,
we secured ‐‐

00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:53,346
If you don't remember
why it's de‐risked, that's bad.

00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,148
[ Laughter ]
Sometimes
it gets a little ‐‐

00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,250
That was a bad time
to pause!

00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,485
[ Laughs ]

00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:00,520
We secured the largest
contract manufacturer

00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,355
in the United States.

00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,590
We raised enough money

00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,692
to where we can get to be
cash‐flow positive.

00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:10,363
We also are in talks with
the largest big‐box retailer ‐‐

00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:11,598
Best Buy.

00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:12,899
So, if it's okay with you,
Mr. Wonderful,

00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,734
I'd like to hear
from the rest of the panel.
Sure.

00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,436
Herjavec:
I mean, I love ‐‐ I love toys.

00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,504
I mean, you name it ‐‐

00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:19,239
If it goes fast, it's risky,
I'll do it.

00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:20,540
For your value...
Mm‐hmm.

00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,641
... which I'm not even
gonna touch,

00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,610
I have to buy into
the premise

00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,479
that this is
a mass‐transportation product,

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,515
and regardless
of what Chris Sacca thinks,

00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:30,617
the wannabe Millennial...

00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,585
O'Leary: He's a little old
for that now, isn't he?

00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:33,687
Cuban: Yeah, he is.
[ Chuckles ]

00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:35,689
Herjavec:
... there's an element of skill

00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:38,558
that you have to have
in order to use it

00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:41,861
that the average older person
is gonna struggle with.

00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:45,298
That would not be me because
I was able to master the device.

00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,533
Yeah, he was
the king on it.

00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:49,069
I don't buy the premise of
a mass‐transportation vehicle.

00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,103
I'm out.

00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:54,641
Sacca: This is a very crowded,
competitive space.

00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,243
What I'm trying to do
is invest in places

00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:58,478
that other people
haven't noticed yet,

00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,480
and all eyes are on this.

00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,249
And so, I might be a consumer,
but in the end,

00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,251
I'm not gonna invest,
so I'm out.

00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,689
Guys, like Chris said,
there's a lot of people

00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,558
just focusing
on that market.

00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:14,394
I think it's a stretch
partially because we compete,

00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:16,496
but for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,198
Thanks, Mark.
I really appreciate your time.
Thank you, Mark.

00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:18,898
Herjavec:
All right, Lori?

00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:21,334
She was just trying to
do Kevin's deal math over here.

00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,702
[ Laughter ]

00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:25,171
Greiner: I like it.
I think it's very cool.

00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,606
I love ingenuity.

00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:29,509
But great you have distributors.
People think it's cool,

00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,610
but people in that business

00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,345
always think
new things are cool.

00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,214
They're waiting
for the next new thing.

00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:36,249
They buy 50, 100, 300.

00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,384
They test it.

00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:38,752
It doesn't mean
they'll come back for more.

00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:41,721
Look, I'm happy with my offer,
but if she goes out,

00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:46,393
it won't be 2.5% equity because
it's the nature of a Shark,

00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:47,794
when there's no competitors,
to make you

00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:51,264
pay a horrible price.
You understand that.

00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,833
You should tell me
if you're in or out.

00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:57,037
Am I competing with you
or not?

00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:05,812
Narrator: Three Sharks are out.

00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:08,648
Dave, Chris, and Ryan have
one offer on the table

00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:12,452
from Kevin for their electric
skateboard company, Inboard.

00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:16,356
But Kevin is threatening
a worse offer if Lori goes out.

00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:20,326
Am I competing with you
or not?

00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:23,263
I would give you
the $750,000 loan,

00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:27,133
8% interest, 36 month,

00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,502
3% equity.

00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,504
Is it possible
we can discuss this as a team?

00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,840
‐Absolutely.
‐Perfect.
‐Awesome.

00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,710
Herjavec:
Half a point difference
between the two of you.

00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,579
Half a point.
Otherwise,
exact same offer.

00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,647
Who do we want more
as a partner?

00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:43,316
Do we want Mr. Wonderful,
or do we want Lori?

00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,318
Lori ‐‐ She's got
the retail side,

00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:46,486
and that can be
a huge help.

00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:48,855
What should we do?

00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,826
All right, let's do it.
Let's do it.

00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:56,362
All right.
All right?

00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,465
Yeah, you say it.
Okay, I'm with you.

00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:00,733
As many others have learned
in the Shark Tank,

00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:03,636
when you leave the tank,
stuff happens.

00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:06,272
And stuff did happen
on this deal.

00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,708
Lori and I decided
to get together on it,

00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:12,445
and we're gonna split it,
but there is a cost

00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,314
because it's
your only offer.

00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:18,451
We're gonna give you the
$750,000 for 36 months at 8%,

00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,688
but we want 5% equity
'cause we want 2.5% each.

00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:25,458
You get a whole lot of support
from both of us,

00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,393
but you're gonna
have to pay a little bit more

00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:30,363
because
you left the tank.

00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:31,397
Haley:
We want to do a deal

00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:32,699
that's gonna actually get by
our investors.

00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:34,334
We have a couple
of founders

00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:35,702
that have exited
from billion‐dollar companies.

00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:38,304
You guys know how big the egos
can be in those circles.

00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,305
So have we.

00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,540
We were gonna
counter your offer ‐‐

00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:44,644
$750,000, 8% ‐‐
Lori's original deal ‐‐

00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,380
3%, which we were gonna
turn down,

00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,515
but now that we have
two Sharks,

00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:49,649
we're gonna
be willing to do it.

00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,384
‐So everybody understands...
‐Yes.
‐Yeah.

00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:55,188
...your counter is a
$750,000 loan at 8% interest...

00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:55,788
Yeah.

00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,724
...paid off
after 36 months...
Right.

00:10:57,724 --> 00:11:00,426
... and in exchange for that,
you will give them

00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:01,861
3% equity
between the two of them.

00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,397
‐Yeah, 1.5% each.
That's correct.
‐That's correct.
‐1.5%

00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,566
What do you say,
Kevin, Lori?

00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:09,302
Unfortunately, I've discussed
this with my partner, Lori.

00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:11,704
We have
no flexibility.

00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:15,041
The best deals are ones
where you squirm a little bit.

00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:20,647
I want
to see you squirm.

00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:22,649
The squirming's gonna be
when I go back to my investors

00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,417
and put that deal
in front of them.

00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,653
There's no way I can go above
3% equity with a loan.

00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:30,256
How about this ‐‐ We would
be willing to pay more interest.

00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:32,458
What about 11%?

00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,427
Certainly not 11%.

00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:35,461
That's more.
[ Laughter ]

00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:36,596
But I would ‐‐
I would do the ‐‐

00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:38,565
Well, what's ‐‐ What's
your counter ‐‐ That is more.

00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:42,869
What's your counter
on the equity if I paid you 9%?

00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,541
All right, we'll do it
at 9% at 4% equity.

00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,578
So, $750,000 loan at 9%,
which is nothing.

00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:54,180
At least let's just say
we're shareholders,

00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,648
but, really, it's a tip.

00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,617
We'll do that deal.
You should take it.

00:11:57,617 --> 00:12:00,720
How about this?
I'll do 10% interest.

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,489
I need ‐‐ I cannot go above
the 3% equity.

00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:06,459
10% interest, 3% equity.

00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:07,860
Why can you not
go above the 3%?

00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,629
'Cause I just know
what our investors have put in

00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:11,364
as bounds as what
they're willing to accept,

00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:12,432
and the fact
that this is a loan ‐‐

00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:14,467
You were offering 4%
when you walked in here.

00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,536
Chris, when you
walked in here...
Yes.

00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:19,405
...you offered 4%
for $750,000 straight equity.

00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,641
I don't think it's unreasonable
to stay at the 4%,

00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:24,210
give you
the $750,000 at 9%.

00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,378
You walk out of here
with a deal.

00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:26,613
You know
you can give us 4%

00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:28,982
'cause you asked for that
in the beginning.

00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,557
You know, I thought Ryan was
the best salesman

00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:39,359
I ever met in my life.

00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:42,161
I think you're just as good.
You both have a deal.

a big red button ‐‐

in front of Lori and Kevin,

Clark: The very next day
after "Shark Tank,"

00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,329
we went on to QVC,
and we sold out of boards

00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,303
We expanded across the U. S.,
and now we're in Japan, Europe,

all around the world.

00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:02,275

we are up to $9 million,

Walmart's a big deal because
they have a lot of stores,

00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,416
and we're in
every single one of them.

to see how much
it's changed her life,

that's why I do what I do.

00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,060
That's why I'm a Shark.

00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,794
I'm so thankful.

00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,730
Nobody deserves it better
than you guys.

00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,332
You've worked hard.
You created something great.

I get emotional every time.

that anything
is possible ‐‐

00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,649
I mean, I was
a struggling mom to them,

00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:47,387
and overnight,
my whole life changed.

00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,554
That's perfect.

We are so thankful
for our "Shark Tank" experience,

00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,692
and I think
that Mom and I are proof

00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:54,627
that a grandma
and a stay‐at‐home mom

00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,629
can become
an overnight success.

00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:59,232
It truly is
the American dream.

My name is Renaldo Webb,

00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,343
I grew up in New Orleans,

00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:12,512
and my sisters and I were raised
by a single mom.

00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:14,480
My mom did everything
to support us.

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,683
She took a job as a cafeteria
lunch lady to make ends meet.

00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:20,720
From an early age, I was always
excited by science and math.

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,755
I was the first person
in my family to go to college.

00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,757
I went to MIT,
where I got my degree in physics

00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:28,094
and also found my passion
for entrepreneurship

00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:29,529
and organization.

00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:31,364
After college, I got
a high‐paying job

helping Fortune 500 companies

00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:34,600
with their
manufacturing efforts.

00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,270
I traveled around the world,
and I really got to see

00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,006
food production done
at a massive scale.

00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:40,673
Here you go.

00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:43,543
I realized that
the average consumer has no idea

00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:45,411
what's in their food
and would be shocked

00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,380
if they knew how it was made.

the business going?

My mom's gone through so much
in her life.

Hi, Sharks.

And we're from Brooklyn,
New York.

and founder of PetPlate.

And Winston here ‐‐
He's our chief tasting officer.

And together

in our company.

PetPlate is the only company

00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:43,669
delivering freshly cooked food

00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,506

00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,774
Now, Sharks, I'm sure you're
familiar with the health issues

00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:51,444
plaguing Americans ‐‐
everything from cancer,

00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:53,412
diabetes, high blood pressure,

00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:56,616
which is all due in some way
to what we eat.

00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:58,784
And unfortunately,
many of these issues are now

00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:01,787
finding their way into our pets
from feeding them the scraps

00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,557
from our overly processed
food supply chain.

00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:07,560
Over 60% of dogs and cats
in America are overweight.

Many more are suffering
from serious issues

such as diabetes and allergies.

00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:14,634
And one in two dogs in America
will die from cancer.

00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:17,537
So, PetPlate
is solving this issue

00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,206
by educating
and empowering pet parents

00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,741
to have healthier

We do.
Bring it on.

00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,781
So, we only use all‐natural
ingredients in PetPlate

00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:31,250
no different than what you'd buy
at a grocery store

00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,485

for our lamb
and vegetables dish.

This is all
of our protein source.

00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:45,331

and sweet potatoes.

smell it coming.
He's so hungry.

00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,470
Then we add in some peas
and carrots.

00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,406
We have pumpkin.
This is for fiber.

00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,641
It makes
the morning walks great.

00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:59,512
And then finally, we have
our healthy oils and vitamins.

00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:03,316
So, Sharks, who wants to give
Winston's favorite dish a try?

00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:04,517

real food...

00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:40,553
Exactly.
... for pets.

00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:43,990
Exactly. So, you can imagine it
as a plated, for example...

00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,590
Yeah.

00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,425

from box to bowl as soon as you
get your delivery.

Is it a subscription service?
Do you sign up?

00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,898
So, right now you sign up
for a month, 3, 6, or 12.

00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,834
Our average subscription length
is three months right now.

What's the price?
How much does it cost?

What's the pricing?

00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:59,538
So, we charge this
by the pound.

00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,340
So, it varies
by the price of your dog.

00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,642
If you have a small,
little Chihuahua,

00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,644
it's gonna be around 30 ‐‐
30 bucks a month.

00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,612
And how many meals
do I get per month?

00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,481

You go in, and you put in
the weight of your dog.

00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,555
And then it takes you
to our meal‐plan options.

00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,324
You can try between getting

so 14 meals a week.

And then we space it out

00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,664
in terms of two deliveries
a week for you.

00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,465
And how much is it
per week?
Webb: Depends on
the size of the dog.

00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:27,533
Depends on
the size of the dog.

00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,468
How many times
do you got to say it?
All right, so,
I got a Chihuahua.

How long have you been
in business?

00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:36,842
For about
eight months now.

00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,678
We're actually just hitting
the eight‐month mark.

00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,479
And it's just in New York?
You're just doing locally?

00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:41,681
So, right now, we can ship
to anywhere

00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,250
within a 300‐mile radius
of New York City,

00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,252
but I am laser‐focused
on making this

Why don't you have

Right now,
I am a one‐man show.

00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:54,527
In order to emulate
the models that are out there

00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,762
with the big guys,
they've gone through

00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,465
this multi‐year
logistics problem

00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:02,435
of building centers
in all the major areas

00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:03,469
so they can fulfill.

00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:04,670
So, how
we're different is

00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,573
it's far simpler to cook
for a dog.

00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,675
We have a set menu ‐‐
about six options.

00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:13,312
We can cook
about 200 to 300 pounds of food

00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:15,414
in about three to four hours.

00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,183
What's your background?

00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:18,517
I was born in New Orleans.

00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:21,821
My mom was a cafeteria worker
at the local public high school.

00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:24,457
I was passionate about
science and mathematics.
Cool.

00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:26,358
I then went to MIT,
where I graduated

00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:27,660
with a degree
in physics there.

00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,428
Wow.
I realized
I wasn't the savant

00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:30,730
that was gonna
discover gravitational waves,

00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,698
even though
I really wanted to.

00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:35,101
But I found my passion
for organization

00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:36,469
and entrepreneurship.

00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:39,572
I traveled all around the world
helping Fortune 500 companies

00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,307
with their supply‐chain ‐‐

00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:42,842
manufacturing, like,
on the factory floor.

00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:45,544
And that's where I got the bulk
of my pet‐food experience ‐‐

00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:48,514
watching this food get made,
seeing the ingredients go in,

00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:52,418
and seeing why the health
of American pets is ‐‐

00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,519
Honestly, it's dismal.

00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:55,488
You know, I really wanted
to change that.

00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:56,956
Wow, Renaldo,
you're one impressive guy.

00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:58,858
Greiner:
Yeah, very impressive.
Thank you. Thank you.

00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:01,794
But I'm curious.
So, you quit your job then.
Yes.

00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:03,796
And you're running this
full time by yourself?

00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:06,532
Exactly. But
the delivery couriers we use ‐‐

00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:08,434
They're being paid in full.

00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:09,668
We're still losing
a little bit of money

00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,470
on the per‐delivery cost
and the logistics.

00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,638
How much did you raise,
Renaldo?

00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:15,174
I didn't raise any money.
Good for you.

00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:16,275
You used
all your own money?

00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,510
I put in about $80,000
of my own money.

00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,378
Good for you.
Wow.

00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:20,846
O'Leary:
My big issue with this deal

00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:24,683
is knowing that the challenges
we had with Plated to get scale,

00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:26,685
you're gonna need
a ton of money.

00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:28,320
No, no, we're not.
Why not?

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,555
We're already
delivering and doing

00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:32,391
over 150 deliveries
with one courier.

00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,294
Where's the tipping point?
How do you get to...big?

00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,428
So, when we hit 500 dogs,

00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:38,397
this is a half‐a‐million‐dollar
business.

00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:41,300
Why don't I,
in a commercial kitchen,

00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,470
create the best pet food,
premium product,

00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,372
but not make it
completely fresh?

00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:47,873
Why deliver it
to people?

00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:50,409
If it kind of came down to it,
and I realized, "You know what?

00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:52,478
I need to put natural
preservatives in this to win,"

00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:53,646
that's what I would do.

00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:58,684
See, Renaldo, for me, like,
I see you as a real hero.

00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:03,455
My concern is I see this
as a challenging business

00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:08,327
because of obstacles
that have to do more with

00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,497
how many people
will care enough to invest

00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:12,698
in the fresh,
home‐cooked meals.

00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:16,302
Robert's point of pivoting,
possibly,

00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:19,572
and creating something
that's easier to sustain

00:22:19,572 --> 00:22:23,242
seems to make sense to me,
but it doesn't fit your mission.

00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:26,212
I wish you the best,
but I'm out.

00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:27,379
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,315
I appreciate all the feedback
on that, Lori.

00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:32,284
I'm not sure
that the market is there.

00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:33,652
If there was a cause
in a small community

00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:36,422
that's deeply passionate
about their dogs,

00:22:36,422 --> 00:22:38,357
it would have spread
to more than 100 users

00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,226
after eight months.
I'm sorry.

00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:41,360
I admire
what you're doing,

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,262
but I don't see the business
right now.

00:22:43,262 --> 00:22:44,330
I'm out.

00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,699
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:50,569
And, Chris, I notice
you haven't asked a question.

00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,671
I would love to be able
to convince you

00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:54,573
why I believe
there's a market for this.

00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:57,376
I'm deeply conflicted
on this deal, man.

00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,777
I hear about your background,
and I think

00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:01,547
to have attained that
is incredibly impressive.

00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:04,383
To go as a black kid
from New Orleans to MIT

00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,685
and to have all that educational
achievement is incredible.

00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:09,488
You're like the dream partner
I would love to work with

00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:12,191
or back
in any of our companies.

00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:13,826
Problem is
you chose the one

00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:16,862
that we're competing with you
in from UberRUSH, right?

00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:19,565
We're pushing couriers
all over the world right now,

00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,634
and we're moving food
all over the world right now.

00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:24,570
So, for me,
it's harder to get super‐excited

00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,538
about funding a guy
who's gonna knock right head‐on

00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:27,806
into one of
our businesses.

00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:30,376
If this thing doesn't pan out,
please get in touch immediately,

00:23:30,376 --> 00:23:32,311
'cause I know we'd be
a great force,

00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:33,712
but I can't do this deal.
I'm out.

00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:36,515
Thank you, Chris.
I appreciate that.

00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,651
Renaldo, I think
you're amazing, right?

00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:41,287
Your accomplishments
speak for themselves.

00:23:41,287 --> 00:23:43,489
The thing about
the pet business,

00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:45,224
whether it's
food or otherwise,

00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:47,393
is that it's
an all‐in business.

00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:50,396
You've got to eat, sleep,
and drink pets 24‐7.

00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:52,431
But I'm not
a 24‐by‐7 pet guy.

00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,601
And you need that infrastructure
and support around you

00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:58,370
from people who have
that same mind‐set.

00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,005
I'm out.

00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:01,640
Thank you.

00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,277
I'm living this right now
with Plated,

00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,512
and they're doing
quite well,

00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:08,881
but they've learned the hard way
how difficult it is to scale.

00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:12,818
Our biggest issue remains
to be competition for customers,

00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:18,023
and we are delivering, and we're
having sustained customers.

00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:21,293
I'm sorry.

00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,162
I'm not gonna
take the journey with you.

00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:24,463
I'm out.

00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,698
Thank you.

00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:28,267
Congratulations, man.
You're gonna crush it.

00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:30,069
Good luck.
Thank you for the time.

00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,239
I'm feeling
a lot of frustration

00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:35,741
just because I'm tired
of hearing "no."

00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:40,212
[ Voice breaking ]
But it doesn't matter
how hard I have to work.

00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:42,481
So... yeah.

00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,616
Very frustrated, but, you know,

00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:48,187
it was never gonna be easy,
and I know that.

00:24:48,187 --> 00:24:51,056
And it never has been, so...

00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:03,168
We know our business more
than anyone else in the world.

00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,070
Let's power pose.

Hey, Sharks.
My name is Geoffrey Woo.

My name is
Michael Brandt.

00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:35,734
We're from San Francisco,
California.

00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:38,704
Our company is Nootrobox,
and we're seeking $2 million

00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,539
in exchange for a 5% stake
in our company.

00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,308
Oh! Hello!
[ Laughter ]

00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:44,910
So Nootrobox isn't
any ordinary company.

00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,347
We're a team of bio‐hackers,
researchers, and technologists.

00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:50,716
And we develop, manufacture,
and sell nootropics.

00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:52,684
Nootropics are
a rapidly growing market

00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:55,687
of brain‐enhancing consumables
and supplements.

00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:58,390
We're from Silicon Valley,
where some of the most creative

00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,492
and ambitious people
in the entire world are.

00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:02,361
And these people are
constantly trying to eke

00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:04,496
more productivity
out of each and every day.

00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:06,532
Bio‐hacking is all about
the experimentation

00:26:06,532 --> 00:26:08,634
and controlling of inputs
into the human body

00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:10,669
as if our bodies are
a complex

00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:12,571
but still understandable
computer system.

00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:13,705
We've looked
at something

00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:16,308
that hundreds of millions
of Americans put into their body

00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,444
on a daily basis ‐‐
a classic cup of coffee.

00:26:18,444 --> 00:26:20,479
We've looked at ways
to re‐engineer coffee

00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:22,381
for something
that's significantly better

00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:23,482
for performance.

00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:26,652
And it's called Go Cubes
Chewable Coffee!

00:26:26,652 --> 00:26:28,720
It's convenient
and portable,

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,389
you can put it
right in your pocket,

00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:32,491
and unlike any ordinary
cup of joe,

00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:35,427
it's precisely dosed with
caffeine and other nootropics

00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,662
so you get
the kick of coffee,

00:26:36,662 --> 00:26:38,464
but it's much more balanced
and steady.

00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,432
The future of coffee is here,
and we want you Sharks

00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,201
to take a bite out of it.

00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:44,503
Herjavec:
Can we try it?
Yeah.

00:26:44,503 --> 00:26:47,439
So, Geoff, just want to be
clear, it was $2 million for 5%?

00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,607
Correct.

00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,243
And to be clear, you named it
after me ‐‐ Cubes, right?

00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:52,277
[ Chuckles ]
Of course.

00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,212

Thank you.
Sure.

00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:55,447
Do you mind
if you tell us

00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,748
more about what's in them
before we eat them?

00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:58,517
It's ‐‐
I don't want
to get roofied.

00:26:58,517 --> 00:27:00,652
[ Laughs ]
So, you have three different
flavors of Go Cubes.

00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:03,355
from lightest to darkest,
you have latte,

00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:04,756
drip coffee, and mocha.

00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:07,226
Each cube has
50 milligrams of caffeine.

00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:08,327
It's a half a cup
of coffee.

00:27:08,327 --> 00:27:09,328
How much sugar?

00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:10,629
Six grams of sugar
per cube.

00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:11,830
Oh, wow.
It's really good.

00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,433
And one thing that's really
great about Go Cubes is because

00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:16,635
it's exactly that
50 milligrams of caffeine,

00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,803
you know exactly
what you're getting.

00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:20,405
But this is not
the first supplement‐type item

00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:22,407
that has a defined amount
of caffeine in it.

00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,610
So, our background is
bio‐hackers, right?

00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:26,345
But first ‐‐
first, lots of people

00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:27,579
call themselves
bio‐hackers.

00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:28,747
Two years ago,
it was just someone

00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:30,649
who was trying to come up
with a better formulation.

00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,452
Yeah, but I think ‐‐
So, let's just talk in terms
of what you're actually doing.

00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:35,654
Yeah, so, I think in terms
of actually speaking

00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,323
about the community ‐‐
A community of what?

00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,392
Of people that are
bio‐hacking with us.

00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:42,494
So, for instance,
we fast.

00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,796
We do intermittent fasting
on a weekly basis,

00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:48,333
where for 36 hours straight,
we consume zero calories.

00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,402
Just water.
Why is that good?

00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:51,670
So, actually,
caloric restriction is actually

00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,839
one of the most compelling ways
to increase longevity.

00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,341
So, you're looking at nutrition.
You're looking at activity.

00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,476
You're looking at sleep.

00:27:57,476 --> 00:27:58,544
You're looking
at all these different things

00:27:58,544 --> 00:28:00,279
and how
they impact the body.
Yeah.

00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:02,347
So, there is a space here,
but why ‐‐

00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,382
Okay,
but why is this ‐‐

00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:05,484
Why is this cube
worth $40 million?

00:28:05,484 --> 00:28:08,720
We started the business in 2014.
We did $55,000 in sales.

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,490
And we've done, year‐to‐date,
almost $1 million revenue.

00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:15,427

Michael, I accept the fact
that you guys are really smart.

Herjavec: I'm not a big chef.
Why would I do this

00:35:16,748 --> 00:35:19,751
instead of making it on a stove
or on a barbecue?

00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:22,387
What's the benefit
of this whole process?

00:35:22,387 --> 00:35:24,489
It's one‐button cooking.

00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:26,491
It's like a ‐‐ It's like
a slow cooker, a crock pot.

00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:27,792
It's a
set‐it‐and‐forget‐it.

00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,762
I cook, as well.
I like to do Burgundian dishes.

00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:32,697
What is that?
What's
a Burgundian dish?

00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:34,332
Burgundian, for example ‐‐
calves liver.

00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:35,867
You don't want
to overcook it.

00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:38,336
So, Lisa, I don't know
any of that stuff.
Do you do that
with all organs of your kills?

00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:39,504
Could you tell us
what it costs?

00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:41,006
Yes, it costs $199.

00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:41,673
How much
have you raised?

00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:45,343
So we ‐‐ In 2012,
we had a seed round of 875k.

00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:48,513
And then last year,
we did a note of $2 million.

00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:50,081
Ooh.
$2 million?

00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:50,649
Yes.
Cuban: Last year?

00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,350
So what was the valuation
of the seed round?

00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,551
The seed round
is $6 million.

00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:55,553
And then was there a warrant
on the note?

00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:57,322
The note is a 10 cap.

00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:58,490
The note's a convert?

00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,724
Correct.
It's straight convert.
Right.

00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:01,459
Hmm.
Cuban: Guys, I think
it's a great product,

00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:03,361
but I just don't see
the momentum

00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:04,562
that I think
you should have.

00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:06,598
I don't really understand
the competitive threats

00:36:06,598 --> 00:36:08,366
since I don't know
the industry.

00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:09,668
So, I'm out.

00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:13,138
So grateful for your time, Mark.
Thank you.

00:36:13,138 --> 00:36:14,639
I have had Sous Vide before.

00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:17,542
I think it's interesting,
but I do think

00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:21,246
that a lot of people just like
to throw steak on the grill,

00:36:21,246 --> 00:36:22,614
and they don't want to do
a secondary step

00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:25,350
to char their meat
or get it crispy.

00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,485
I'm not going to invest.

00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:29,120
I wish you the best.

00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,455
I'm out.

00:36:30,455 --> 00:36:31,790
Thank you
very much, Lori.

00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:34,626
Let me just clear the deck.
Sous Vide ‐‐ Moo Vide ‐‐ I ‐‐

00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:37,395
Pbht.
It's all French to me.

00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:38,730
It is French.
[ Chuckles ]

00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:41,332
Aha.
The idea of planning my meal

00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:43,401
like that is just ‐‐
is just foreign.

00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:46,438
And I like to invest in stuff
that I have a taste for.

00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:49,207
It's just not a market for me.
I'm out.

00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,608
Thank you.
Abe: Thank you.

00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:53,411
I mean, it's funny. It doesn't
matter what it's called.

00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:54,646
It just
tastes delicious.

00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:56,381
And I just want
to know ‐‐

00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:58,349
How did you get to the valuation
you're asking for here?

00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:01,519
We expect to have
$5 million in revenue

00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:04,556
in the next 12 months,
and our valuation is consistent

00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:08,326
with other companies with that
sort of revenue projection.

00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:10,095
Basically, you're not gonna
make much money,

00:37:10,095 --> 00:37:10,862
even after $5 million.

00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:14,199
But are you coming in
under the cap of the last round?

00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:15,300
That's...

00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,534
We know that if we bring
a Shark on,

00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:18,536
you guys are gonna be
very hard‐core.

00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:21,539
You see the value
of having a Shark on the team.

00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:22,640
That's right.
We do.

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,444
Well, you have two Sharks
left ‐‐ Kevin and Chris.

00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:28,446
Let's see, Lisa,
if you can get a deal

00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:29,781
from one or both of them.

00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:32,851
I would love both because
one Shark is like a volcano.

00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:36,154
Two Sharks is like a lightning
striking that volcano.

00:37:36,154 --> 00:37:37,388
Sharknado.
[ Laughter ]

00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:39,758
Sharknado!
Sharknado!

00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:42,827
I have two constituencies that
I think this would appeal to.

00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:45,830
One are the customers of Plated,
of which I'm an inventor.

00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,633
They'll be supportive
of a Shark deal, obviously.

00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:51,436
And the other are
my quarter of a million people

00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:52,504
who have bought my wines.

00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:54,172
They're all foodies.

00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:54,806
I make the suggestions.

00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:57,342
They believe me
because I'm really good at it,

00:37:57,342 --> 00:37:58,643
and I have the palate.

00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:01,312
I'll do this deal ‐‐
$250,000.

00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:03,214
I want 10%.

00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:05,383
We really respect
that offer.

00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:06,317
Thank you.

00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:07,652
It comes from the heart.

00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:10,321
Well, we'd love to hear
what Chris has to say.

00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:11,356
I would, too.
Chris?

00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:12,457
That's 10%
of your company.
Correct.

00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:13,625
Are you gonna take
a board seat over there?

00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,360
I don't need a board seat.
I need 10%.

00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,728
Are you gonna co‐office
with them?

00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:19,097
My bottom line is
this is a lot of risk,

00:38:19,097 --> 00:38:19,731
and you know it, too.

00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:22,534
I'm very curious, though,
about this equity.

00:38:22,534 --> 00:38:24,369
Let's talk about
how those notes work.

00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:27,605
So you had
$2 million worth of investment

00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:29,541
come in
on a document that says,

00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:33,478
"We're investing as if
the price were $10 million."

00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:36,514
But later on,
the price is $5 million,

00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:38,516
and they convert
into the company.

00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:40,518
Subject to that $10 million cap,

00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:43,688
it comes all the way down
at a big discount now.

00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:46,624
Those investors are gonna own
most of your company.

00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:48,827
You guys, as the founders,
aren't gonna own anything.

00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:51,596
Just to be clear,
if you do a deal at $5 million,

00:38:51,596 --> 00:38:53,598
how much of the company
do you end up owning?

00:38:53,598 --> 00:38:55,500
How much do the investors
end up owning?

00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,468
Right now we own 51%.

00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:59,537
Well, you're not after this.

00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:02,473
The biggest allure to this deal
is you, Lisa.

00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:04,242
I think you're the package
right here.

00:39:04,242 --> 00:39:05,510
Thank you.
I love your presence.

00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,512
I love how well you've handled
these questions.

00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:09,581
You're an amazing
entrepreneurial force.

00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:12,584
As we talk about the terms
of this deal, though,

00:39:12,584 --> 00:39:15,520
I really get worried
when I see a deal

00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,390
that leaves you not owning much
of the company at all.

00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,392
How do you help me
get past that?

00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:23,361
Sure. We're here
with that deal

00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:26,698
to make it
appetizing for you.

00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,366
That's why I'm up here.
I'm ‐‐

00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,701
So, are you throwing my deal
under the bus?

00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:32,437
I get that, but I don't want
to work with people

00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:33,605
who don't have a ton of upside

00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:35,106
left in their own company.
They're not happy.

00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:37,609
We'd love to give you
adviser shares.
Lisa, I'm gonna make it
easier for you.

00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:39,377
I'm gonna make it
easier for you.
Chris Sacca,
give us a deal.

00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,879
I'm out.

00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:50,688
Narrator:
Four Sharks are out.

00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:53,291
Chris Sacca is interested
in Abe and Lisa's

00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:54,726
Sous Vide machine, Nomiku,

00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:57,295
but is concerned
that his investment would result

00:39:57,295 --> 00:39:59,397
in them diluting
their equity so much,

00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,499
they would no longer have skin
in the game.

00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:05,236
The best deals are the deals
where we are all super‐excited

00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,337
to get out of bed every morning

00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:07,639
because we're all gonna make
a lot of money.

00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:09,574
We're all gonna have
positive impact.

00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,509
So, if we go and do this deal,

00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:13,544
you guys would be diluted
to the teens.

00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:15,713
And so at the end of this round,

00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:18,816
how much of the company
would you guys like to own?

00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:21,552
See, I think a couple
owning 10% of the company

00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:22,754
doesn't get it done.

00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:25,356
Okay, what do you...?
What do you think?

00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:26,524
It's the craziest deal
I've ever seen.

00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:27,692
I ‐‐
Greiner: It is.

00:40:27,692 --> 00:40:29,694
I don't want you guys
to shoot yourselves in the foot.

00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:32,597
We won't.
If this is your life's work,
and this is your passion,

00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:35,767
you should be fighting as hard
as you can to not give it away.

00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,702
We're listening to you.
We're listening to you.

00:40:37,702 --> 00:40:42,273
Because this takes off
with us together.

00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,008
Here's my offer.

00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:48,413
I'm gonna give you 250k...

00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:50,748
for 10% of the company...

00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:54,485
contingent upon you going back
to your other investors

00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:56,754
and making sure you get
enough stock back from them

00:40:56,754 --> 00:41:00,391
that you own 40% of the company
at the end of the deal.

00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:03,728
I get 10%, you get 40%,
they get 50%.

00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:08,399
Would you ‐‐ Would you be open
to a counter of 8%?

00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:10,335
[ Laughs ]
Oh, my gosh!
Really?!

00:41:10,335 --> 00:41:12,537
After all that ‐‐
all that work he did for you

00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:13,604
and looked out for you,

00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:15,673
you're gonna
rake him over for 2%?

00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:17,442
So, you guys are
suddenly ‐‐
I'm doing
what he told me to do.

00:41:17,442 --> 00:41:19,410
I don't think you're pausing
to think about it.

00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,212
I think you're just
reflexively trying to squeeze

00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:22,347
a couple more points
out of me.

00:41:22,347 --> 00:41:23,448
So, pausing
to think about it ‐‐

00:41:23,448 --> 00:41:24,682
Don't negotiate
for the sake of negotiating.

00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:26,551
Lisa: Okay. Okay.
That deal's not possible

00:41:26,551 --> 00:41:28,720
without taking down
your other investors about 15%.

00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,722
They know that.
But they get to negotiate
with them.

00:41:30,722 --> 00:41:32,323
Those investors are
all grown‐ups

00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,926
who got into a risky company
earlier on.

00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,195
Do we have a deal?

00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:45,269
We're gonna take it.

00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:46,471
All right!
Let's do it!

00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:48,773
Thank you.
Congratulations.

00:41:48,773 --> 00:41:50,508
Cheers.
Right on, man.
Thank you.

00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,377
Hey, congrats.
This is cool.

00:41:52,377 --> 00:41:54,445
Yeah,
thank you so much.
Thank you, guys.

00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:55,446
All right, guys.

00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:57,181
Greiner: Bye.

00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,383
Oh, they're skipping!

00:41:58,383 --> 00:41:59,517
Herjavec:
Oh, they're skipping down ‐‐

00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,786
Lisa: Wow, Chris Sacca is
the freaking bomb.

00:42:01,786 --> 00:42:04,655
We're gonna get
such a fighter on our side.

00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:08,526
He really ‐‐ He really loves us
and looked out for us.

00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:09,594
That was amazing.

00:42:09,594 --> 00:42:10,762
They obviously
undervalued themselves

00:42:10,762 --> 00:42:12,263
around the first
and second round.
No, I ‐‐ Look, Chris,

00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:13,731
I think it's a great deal
for you. I really, really do.

00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:15,466
The earlier investors
took a risk.

00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:16,634
They knew they were
taking a risk.

00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:18,403
Things didn't play out for them
exactly like they wanted.

00:42:18,403 --> 00:42:19,537
It's not
the first down ‐‐

00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,639
So, I don't feel bad
taking it out of their hides.

00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:23,374
It's not
the first‐down round.

00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,642
It's not
the last‐down round...

00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:25,977
That's true.
... that'll ever happen.
