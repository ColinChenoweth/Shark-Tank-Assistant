00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,371
So I figured it was time
to start my own company.

for being able

00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:14,179
allowing your thumbs
to come out.

00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:15,480
Do you have a patent
on the product?

00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,382
We currently have a pending
utility patent

00:35:17,382 --> 00:35:18,583
that was filed in February.

00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,151
Well, tell us about
your sales.

00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:21,219
I bet people are receiving
you well.

00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:22,420
Talk about the company
and the economics.

00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,689
So, first‐year sales
was $15,000.

00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:28,293
And that was pretty much
regionally in Salt Lake City.

00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:31,363
And this year,
we're at $125,000 so far.

00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:33,198
‐Good for you.
‐Okay, so what happened

00:35:33,198 --> 00:35:35,233
between $10,000
to $125,000?

00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:37,335
We got picked up
by Big box.

00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:39,170
‐Which one?
‐REI.

00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,139
That's the only retailer
you're in now?

00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,475
Besides our 12
core shops locally.

00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:45,910
Like, little ski shops.
How about online?

00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,078
Anything online?

00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:47,879
We're on Amazon,

00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:49,114
and then we have our direct
sales from our site.

00:35:49,114 --> 00:35:50,582
‐How much do you sell it for?
‐How much does it cost,

00:35:50,582 --> 00:35:52,283
and how much
do you make it for?

00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:53,685
So, depending on the style ‐‐

00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:56,655
anywhere from the one Lori has
is our lightweight ‐‐

00:35:56,655 --> 00:36:01,126
those cost $11,
wholesale for $20,

00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:02,293
and they retail for $40.

00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,362
‐What about this?
‐That's our Pro model.

00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:07,432
That one costs $32,
we wholesale it for $60,

00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:08,566
and it retails $120.

00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:11,369
It's a great glove.
Like, it's really well‐made.

00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:13,371
It's a durable glove, and
the ones I'm actually wearing

00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:16,241
is the only pair I've had the
entire length of the company.

00:36:16,241 --> 00:36:17,575
‐Four years.
‐Four years.

00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:20,078
So, you were saying
you have a patent pending.

00:36:20,078 --> 00:36:21,946
‐Correct.
‐What's the patent on?

00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:22,580
Just unzipping it?

00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,250
So, it's on the zipper and then,
also, the wrist strap.

00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,252
So, you get your hand out,

00:36:27,252 --> 00:36:28,553
and the way
the wrist strap functions ‐‐

00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:30,522
if your hand's gonna be out
for a long duration ‐‐

00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:31,656
it tucks it
out of the way.

00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:34,225
So, Jake, you're out there,
you guys are hustling,

00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:35,393
you've got
a Big box retailer.

00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:37,662
What's the game plan for
the next couple of years?

00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:40,398
Honestly, we'd like to expand
into other markets.

00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:42,434
We started with skiing
and snowboarding,

00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:45,236
but we see it functioning
for everyone else ‐‐

00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:48,139
hunting, fishing,
construction, military.

00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:49,507
But it is a seasonal product.

00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:51,476
We do have the option
of the southern hemisphere,

00:36:51,476 --> 00:36:53,244
which has the complete
opposite winter.

00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:55,380
So, this is something
we could run year‐round.

00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,748
How did you two meet?

00:36:56,748 --> 00:37:01,419
I've been skiing up in Utah
for the last 3‐some years.

00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:03,388
And I'm 28,
he's known me my whole life.

00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:05,490
His mother sold me
a place up there.

00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,225
He worked for a glove
manufacturer,

00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,326
and he built the company.

00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:10,161
‐That's my history.
‐And then they sort of...

00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,563
‐Got it.
‐Now you're the glove guy.

00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:13,331
‐Now I'm the glove guy.
‐So, he says to you,

00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:14,499
"Hey, I've got this idea"?

00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:15,600
The deal came up,
I said, "Jake,

00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,601
this might be a great
opportunity for you."

00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:18,436
‐He's the guy.
‐Yeah, he is the guy.

00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:20,572
Don, tell us a little bit
about your background.

00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:23,308
You're in amazing shape,
you started Bally's.

00:37:23,308 --> 00:37:25,310
I'm a typical guy.
I can identify with him

00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:27,245
'cause I didn't graduate
from high school.

00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,114
I started Bally's after
I got out of the army.

00:37:29,114 --> 00:37:31,216
I was a combat medic
in Korea.

00:37:31,216 --> 00:37:32,383
Wow.

00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:34,486
I went to work for
a small health‐club chain,

00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:35,620
and then they went bankrupt

00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,555
and the creditors came to me
and said,

00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:40,325
"You get our money back,
we'll give you the clubs."

00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:42,327
So, I took five clubs over
in Chicago

00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:46,231
and then built it into a deal
where, ultimately,

00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:48,233
I got bought out
and it allowed me

00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:51,102
to go snowboard
70, 80 days a year.

00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,203
Cuban:
They're great gloves.

00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:54,172
Why do you think
you haven't sold more?

00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:55,473
Because we
haven't really ‐‐

00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:58,343
we've been concentrating
in the Utah market, basically.

00:37:58,343 --> 00:38:00,345
It's been really regional,
right now, in the West.

00:38:00,345 --> 00:38:02,247
I think you're missing
a piece here.

00:38:02,247 --> 00:38:03,681
I think you have Don,
who I think, Don,

00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:05,650
you're a good salesman.
‐You got to talk loud.

00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,319
I said, "Don,
you're a handsome man!"

00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:09,354
Well, thank you.

00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:10,655
[ Laughter ]

00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:12,390
If I had some better ears
it'd be better.

00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:16,528
Okay. Don, I said you're
a natural‐born salesman,

00:38:16,528 --> 00:38:19,297
I feel, so ‐‐ I'm sure you've
been selling your whole life.

00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,533
Jake, I don't think you are.

00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:24,135
But I'm gonna
make you an offer.

00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,503
But I want somebody else
in with me,

00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:27,539
'cause I'm not gonna take
this amount of risk.

00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:31,009
I'm gonna give you half
the money you're looking for,

00:38:31,009 --> 00:38:32,410
for 12.5% equity,

00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,612
but you have to get another
shark to come in

00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:38,650
for the other half,
for a total of 25% equity.

00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,686
Herjavec:
Don, you're one impressive guy,

00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:46,191
and I think that the challenge
is, it is a fantastic glove,

00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:47,692
but there are
similar products.

00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:50,161
I don't know how I can help it
get really big.

00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,496
I'm out.

00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:52,797
Cuban: I think it's a brilliant
glove, right?

00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:56,267
I'll wear it, I'll tell people,
I'll show bit off, all right?

00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:58,603
The challenge is putting
together a marketing plan

00:38:58,603 --> 00:39:00,738
and having the organization
that you need.

00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:04,209
I've always been ‐‐ you know,
I had 15,000 employees ‐‐

00:39:04,209 --> 00:39:06,344
‐Wow.
‐And you get too large.

00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,346
Oh, no, look,
I agree with you there.

00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,515
The question is, if I come in,
what happens?

00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:13,184
If I had people that were
in the outdoors market

00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,352
that I really could just say,

00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,287
"You know what,
let's just fit you in.

00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:18,356
We'll complement the people
that you have."

00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:21,292
This is just not one of the
areas I've ever focused on.

00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:23,094
So, I'm out.

00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:28,499
Corcoran:
Don, I offered you half of what
you were looking for here,

00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:30,268
but you have to get
someone else in.

00:39:30,268 --> 00:39:33,872
Now you only have Lori
and Mr. Wonderful.

00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,651
Narrator:
Two sharks are out.

00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:49,320
Barbara's willing to put up
half the money

00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,056
Don and Jake are seeking
for a 12.5% stake

00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,424
in their Hand Out Glove company.

00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:56,995
But they must get the rest of
the money from another shark.

00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:58,229
What do you think, guys?

00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,764
I've gone through the process

00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:03,201
of getting a product into a Big
box in winter garments and ‐‐

00:40:03,201 --> 00:40:05,236
the word is, it sobered me.

00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,539
It made me realize
how frigging hard it is,

00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:11,676
and how the whole things skews
to big guys

00:40:11,676 --> 00:40:14,412
that are willing to invest
huge amounts of capital.

00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,248
It's not for me,
but the story's fantastic.

00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,383
Sorry, guys, I'm out.

00:40:18,383 --> 00:40:20,485
All right.
Thank you, Kevin.

00:40:20,485 --> 00:40:22,487
‐All right, Kevin's out.
‐All right, Lori.

00:40:22,487 --> 00:40:25,356
I think, for me,
you guys are great guys.

00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:27,425
You're amazing.
‐Uh‐oh, doesn't sound good.

00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:32,096
But the problem is,
it's such a crowded space,

00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,165
it worries me to invest in it.

00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:35,433
You were sharing your sales.

00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,136
I think the reason
that the sales are small

00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:39,437
is not because it's not good,

00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,472
but just because
there's so many options.

00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,207
No, that wasn't the case.

00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:44,442
And so, for that reason,
I'm out.

00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,144
‐The case was it was ‐‐
‐Thank you.
‐Barb.

00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:47,412
‐Everybody's out.
‐Ay‐yi‐yi.

00:40:47,412 --> 00:40:49,614
If you believe in it,
if you believe <i>enough</i> in it ‐‐

00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:52,450
Barb, come in
for the full 25%.
Yeah.

00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,119
Do you believe enough in it to
put up the entire $150,000?

00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,287
I'll tell you
what I'll do.

00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,289
If you believe in it, Barb,
do the deal.

00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,458
‐My lover is speaking.
‐All right.

00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:05,496
For 25%,
I'll take $300,000

00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:07,665
and put it in as capital
into the company.

00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:11,135
So, now the company has
a better balance sheet.

00:41:13,371 --> 00:41:14,772
‐I'll tell you what, Don ‐‐
‐What?

00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:19,444
I'll give you ‐‐ if you want to
put your $300,000 in as capital,

00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:23,381
I'll give you another $300,00
as a credit line

00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:27,185
against cost of goods,
with 6% interest,

00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:29,320
for 25% equity.

00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,489
So, just so I'm clear ‐‐

00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,491
Don's got to put
in $300,000

00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,193
to the company in terms
of equity.

00:41:35,193 --> 00:41:36,361
‐The current ‐‐
‐Yeah.

00:41:36,361 --> 00:41:39,230
You'll put up $300,000
as a line of credit

00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,165
against receivables.

00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,034
But you want 25%.

00:41:43,034 --> 00:41:44,135
Yes, Robert.

00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:52,210
Barbara, we'd love
to take that deal.

00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:54,178
‐Yes!
‐Good job, guys.

00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,446
‐Whoo!
‐Well done.

00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:58,282
‐Easy, Don, easy.
‐Don, I'm so happy to hear it.

00:41:58,282 --> 00:42:01,953
‐Uh‐oh.
‐Whoa!

00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:03,187
Yeah!

00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,389
[ Laughter ]

00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:05,490
Corcoran: Lovely.

00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:07,392
Herjavec: Keep your hands
off him, Barb!

00:42:07,392 --> 00:42:09,193
‐I can't help myself.
‐Good job.

00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,528
‐Keep working out.
‐Wow, look at your arms.

00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:11,662
A few years
to look like you.

00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:13,431
‐That was fun.
‐That was awesome, Wildman.

00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:15,633
I think we got
the good deal.

00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:17,435
Wildman:
We do feel proud of ourselves,

00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:19,504
being able to tell people
that the Shark Tank

00:42:19,504 --> 00:42:21,572
had enough faith in this
business to jump in.

00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:25,076
It means a lot, and it gives us
even more confidence

00:42:25,076 --> 00:42:26,411
than we already had.
