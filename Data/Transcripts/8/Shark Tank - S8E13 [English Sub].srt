Yes, it is.

add waste to our landfills.

It's gonna leave too much
of a market unavailable.

Then it wouldn't be
compostable.

Those typically are people
that are more health conscious,

are doing as much frying.

create your biggest challenge.

is just way, way, way too much.

because it costs us ‐‐

So, I ‐‐
it's crazy to think about it,

00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,517

00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,719

No, we didn't raise
any money.

00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,877
I started this
with my best friend at the time,

was in the back end,

00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:42,655

connected to the business.

00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,824

part of it?

‐He still owns 15%.
‐15?

‐I disagree.
‐Not bendable.

00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:58,604
Actually, I would ask, "Would
you be able to make a crown?

00:13:58,604 --> 00:13:59,839
Would you be able to make
a watch?"

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,742
‐And do you have a patent on it?
‐Yes, I applied for two patents,

00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:05,044
and yesterday got
my design patent granted.

00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,880

So, the design is
of the shape of the piece.

00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,782

how the piece looks.
That.

00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:10,883

O'Leary: I have to admit,
this is interesting

the bendability

plus the pixelation artwork
is kind of different.

00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,927
You know, years ago
I sold my company to Mattel,

00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,563
and I worked there
for a year and a half

00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:24,831
and I got a pretty good dose

00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:26,766
of the understanding
of the toy industry.

00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:28,835
I'm gonna make you an offer.

00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:31,504
The only way I see
for this to work

00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:34,807
is that you actually partner
with another toy company

00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:37,877
that's going to get this
into their product line.

00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,681
They would probably license it
in perpetuity,

00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:43,449
pay you a royalty.

00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:47,453
I would do that deal,
but I want 30%.

00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:48,955
In other words,

00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:52,658
I'll give you the 100K
with a giant contingency.

00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,861
I have no interest
in investing in this

00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:57,930
unless I can put it into
a very large toy manufacturer

00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,600
that provides marketing
and distribution globally.

00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,468
This is actually something

00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,904
that goes against
my original strategies.

00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,673
My strategy is to really
build on the brand

Based on that profile,
our breast‐feeding stylists

00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:39,718
hand‐select nursing tops
and dresses to match.

00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:41,954
We then send that
curated shipment to their house,

to try on the clothes

you charge me $29 a month,

just the curating fee.
Yes.

00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:34,540
So in your example,
is this box arrives

and I say,
"Wow, I want to buy this."

00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:39,778
I then have to purchase it.
‐You just keep it...

How much money did you put
into the business?

00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:20,578
So, I've put in
just shy of $300,000.

00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:21,579
‐Whoa!
‐$300,000?

00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:22,881
‐$300,000!
‐Wow!

00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:25,583
Why did you ‐‐
how did you spend so much money?
Where did it go?

00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:28,620
I'm sitting on $65,000 worth
of inventory right now.

00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,921
So, what's
your core competency?

00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,923
What is it
that you're just phenomenal at?

00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:36,428
I think that I am
a valuable executive.

00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:37,829
I think
that I understand people.

00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:38,997

how to manage people.

00:36:38,997 --> 00:36:40,732

‐You're killing me, Lisa.

Mark?

00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:43,702
Because that's so generic,
right?

00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:44,703
It's not generic at all.

00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:45,870
You gotta have something you
fall back on where you say,

00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,772
"I am so good at this,
no one can touch me."

00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:49,074
‐She's a great executive.
‐Look at me.

00:36:49,074 --> 00:36:51,943
I'm standing here, doing this.
And I feel like I'm doing great.

him, give him hell, Harry.

All men think
they're right all the time.

00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,682
I think I executed
this exceptionally well

00:36:57,682 --> 00:36:59,718
with no background in business.
‐That's fine.

00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:02,420
Do you think companies
don't need CEOs?

00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,522

‐Yeah, it's you.

00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:07,425
But you're not a CEO.

00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:08,626
When you stand on that carpet

00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:10,795
and you tell me your business
is worth $1 million,

00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:13,531
all the niceties and all
the stuff goes out the window.

00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,266
The fact that
you had to spend $300,000...

00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:17,702
That's her choice, Mark.
What she chose to spend her
money on is her choice.

00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:19,537
The fact
that she had to spend that much,

00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:21,539
because you didn't know
what you were confident in.

00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:23,742
It's not that I don't know
what I'm confident in.

00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:24,909
It's that I have determination,

00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,911
and I think that
is more valuable than saying,

00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,748
"I'm really good
at designing."
Was $300,000
your entire life savings?

00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:32,817
Listen, let's just say we're not
buying a house any time soon.

00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:36,688
At the end of the day, this is
a business that did $80,000.

00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:38,757
There is no scenario
on this planet

00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:41,226

$1 million.

I had no mentor.

You can do it.
