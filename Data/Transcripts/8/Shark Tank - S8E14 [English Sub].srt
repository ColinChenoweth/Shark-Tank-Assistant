Is it 50% reduction?

00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:36,075
No, so, it's gonna reduce
22 decibels on average

00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:36,609
across frequencies.

00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,511
What decibel level
does this play at?

00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:40,380
I'd say
95 to 105 decibels.

00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,081
So, to give you
a point of reference,

00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,850
95 in an arena is loud.

00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:48,187
So, anything above 85 decibels
is damaging to your hearing.

00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:50,656
So at 100 to 115 decibels,

from options,

or gingerbread house.

structural components,

their design comes to life

to manage a city?

Because over time, particularly
because of the elements,

00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,849
you're gonna have to depreciate
those assets.

over 10 years with ‐‐

the problem with this deal

you're gonna find out with other
Sharks ‐‐ I may be wrong ‐‐

00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,933
is that there's gonna be
a big fight about valuation

00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:38,603
because nobody wants to put it
in at a $10 million valuation.

00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:41,106

for a lot more equity.

00:35:41,106 --> 00:35:42,440
I'm going the other way.

00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:04,722
Sacca: You know
what happens sometimes?

00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:06,624
You come in here
and you're negotiating

00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:09,427
with a professional negotiator,
and before you know it,

00:42:09,427 --> 00:42:11,863
you've just dug yourself into
a hole you can't get out of.

00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:14,532
Staff:
We got to be loyal to the people
who brought us here,

00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,268
and making that deal with Chris
would have been disloyal.

00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:19,303
Look, when we're
a $1 billion company

00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:20,471
and they're stressed out

00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:22,540
that they're missing on
the returns they could have had,

00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,475
we're gonna let them stay
in a Getaway.

00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:26,477
We're the bigger men.
