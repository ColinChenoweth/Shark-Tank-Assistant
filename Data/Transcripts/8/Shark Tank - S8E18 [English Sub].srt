we woke up on the beach

super uncomfortable

a pillow inside a beach towel.

the pillow towel.

selling it on the beach,

it was a total fail.

when we first

the first thing
we wanted to do,

00:04:42,581 --> 00:04:45,017
we went to the towels that
were thicker and luxurious,

00:04:45,017 --> 00:04:48,821
and when we tested the market
by selling one by one by two

00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:51,891
at the beach, we found out
that people wanted

00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,926
something different,
and they wanted something

00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:55,694
that was easy to carry
in their backpack,

00:04:55,694 --> 00:04:56,996
easy to fit in their purse.
That's fair enough.

00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:59,632

a beach product for the beach,

as opposed to in your home
in your ‐‐ in your bathroom.

00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,835
It feels more like
a wrap, though, like a sarong.

00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:04,904
Yeah. So, the great thing
about these is because ‐‐

00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:07,440
you know, because of
the lightweight material,

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,641
it doubles as a sarong.

make these great things?

00:14:23,695 --> 00:14:25,497
‐Absolutely. Yes.
‐I got it.

00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:26,898
Ron, tell us a little bit
about yourself.

00:14:26,898 --> 00:14:29,534
So, uh, I'm a chef,
as you can see.

00:14:29,534 --> 00:14:31,770
Um, growing up,
my parents owned and operated

00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,740
six restaurants, so I've been
a foodie all of my life.

00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,409
But my uncle died
of a heart attack,

00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:38,577
uh, when he was 55.

00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:40,646
My grandfather had
triple‐bypass surgery.

00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:41,913
Wow.
And none of
these health problems

00:14:41,913 --> 00:14:44,716
really occurred until
they moved over to the U. S.

00:14:44,716 --> 00:14:46,618
Where were they from?
They were from Taiwan.

00:14:46,618 --> 00:14:48,887
And I put two and two together,
and it was the diet.

00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:50,822
So, I quit my job
in tech consulting

00:14:50,822 --> 00:14:52,958
and dedicated myself
towards healthy living.

00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,960
‐How did you meet Will?
‐So, we are actually, uh,

00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,796
freshman‐year roommates
in college at U. C. Berkeley.

00:14:57,796 --> 00:15:00,432
Professionally, uh,
I come from a background of

00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:01,867
strategy and operations
consulting,

00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:04,503
um, for life sciences
and healthcare companies.

00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:06,538
So, Will, do you have
customers today?

00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:07,673
Uh, we do.

00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,608
To date, um,
in under 10 months, we've sold

00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:11,677
over $400,000,
about $415,000.

00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:12,678
‐That's very good.
‐Very good.

00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:13,745
‐That's not horrible.
‐Very good.

00:15:13,745 --> 00:15:15,647
‐Where are you selling?
‐We've sold ‐‐

00:15:15,647 --> 00:15:17,516
‐Online mainly.
‐Just online?

00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:18,684
It's been
our only channel.

00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,585
How much did you
sell last month?

00:15:20,585 --> 00:15:23,755
Um, in the first seven months,
we sold like gangbusters

00:15:23,755 --> 00:15:25,791
and starting
selling out of product.

00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,794
We went from basically
$0 to $65,000 a month.

00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:30,595
‐Why weren't you sourcing more?
‐So, you only made

00:15:30,595 --> 00:15:32,597
a limited amount
and then you started to sell out

00:15:32,597 --> 00:15:34,299
and then you couldn't
manufacture again

00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:34,833
or take a wait‐list order?

00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,735
Uh, so, we ‐‐
we did, actually.

00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:38,336
We brought in
a little bit of money,

00:15:38,336 --> 00:15:39,471
um, on a convertible note.

00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:40,539
We raised that quickly.
How much?

00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:41,740
We raised $150,000.

00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,575
What valuation
did you raise that on?

00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:47,446
That was for a $2.2 million
post‐money valuation.

00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,281
There's a lot
of people doing this.

00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,549
Highly, highly competitive.

00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:53,719
I thought that you had
a food‐based product

00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:57,389
with a different delivery ‐‐
online or something.

00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:58,824
It's not something I use.

00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:02,561
I'm not the Shark.
I'm out.

00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:03,662
Thank you so much, Robert.

00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:07,733
$415,000 in sales in 10 months
is great. It really is.

00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,935
But you're valuing
the company at $7.5 million.

00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:13,472
Why do you think
that a Shark is gonna join in

00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,608
for 5% for $375,000?

00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:20,112
Yeah, um, so, the fast growth,
the size of the industry,

00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:20,879
as you guys know 30 to 40 ‐‐

00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,547
‐All right.
‐It's very competitive.

00:16:22,547 --> 00:16:24,950
Okay, so, as soon as people say
the size of the industry,

00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,854
that's an indicator that you
don't have enough information.

00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:32,324
That number is ridiculous.
You're just unrealistic.

00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,227
I'm out.

00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:35,861
I'm your customer.

00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:38,663
I'm into healthy,
natural, organic.

00:16:38,663 --> 00:16:43,602
I'm so up on all of these
things, but this bottle,

00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:47,606
if I were to walk down
the store aisle in Whole Foods,

00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:51,476
I feel like this is not
going to work for you,

00:16:51,476 --> 00:16:54,713
because when you have
a multivitamin,

00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,681
it's so tiny here where it says

00:16:56,681 --> 00:16:59,718
"Men's plant‐based
multivitamin."

00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:04,422
I have to be drawn to this
bottle to pay attention to it.

00:17:04,422 --> 00:17:07,359
So I'm concerned
about your marketing.

00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,796
Sorry. I'm out.

00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:13,632
Look, you know, when I heard
you talk about being a chef,

00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,500
what I immediately thought of,

00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,702
"Okay, they're gonna
actually create foods,

00:17:17,702 --> 00:17:19,838
maybe rather than selling
them at retail,

00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:23,475
they'll sell them to, you know,
Plated and Blue Apron."

00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:24,810
That, to me, is a win.

00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,846
Being dependent on just
being a brand

00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:32,350
and trusting that you're unique,
that's a stretch.

00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,587
I'm out.

00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:37,856
So, Kevin,
you're the only one left.

00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:42,494
So, this deal is challenged
by the competition.

00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:43,628
I love it's on trend,
et cetera.

00:17:43,628 --> 00:17:46,731
I like the fact you have sales,
but getting share

00:17:46,731 --> 00:17:49,467
is gonna be really hard,
and I feel the valuation

00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:51,903
you put on it at
$7.5 million is extreme.

00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:54,539
There's nothing wrong
with reaching for the stars,

00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:55,540
but I'm a Shark.

00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,310
I'm not just any investor.

00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,545
That's also good news for you.

00:18:00,545 --> 00:18:02,581
Because I'm gonna
make you an offer.

00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:06,284
I'm gonna give you $375,000.

00:18:06,284 --> 00:18:07,452
I want 20%.

00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:09,321
Ohh!

00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:23,401
Narrator:
Four Sharks are out.

00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:26,605
Will and Ron
are seeking $375,000

00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,307
for 5% of their
natural‐supplement company,

00:18:29,307 --> 00:18:30,542
Ora Organic.

00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,677
But Kevin wants
a bigger piece of the pie.

00:18:32,677 --> 00:18:36,348
I'm gonna give you
the $375,000.

00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:38,083
I want 20%.

00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,651
Ohh!

00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,553
I'm not even interested
in negotiating, guys.

00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:44,756
This is not an easy deal
by any means.

00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:47,759
I'll do that, or you can pass.
You choose.

00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,928
So, you're firm,
$375,000, 20%?

00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:51,730
I‐I'm ‐‐ Look ‐‐
We're not gonna take
a down‐round.

00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,598
Meet ‐‐
It's not a down‐round.

00:18:53,598 --> 00:18:54,599
Meet us at ‐‐
You've got a Shark.

00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:55,600
It's an up‐round.

00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,335
You know that music
that you had...

00:18:57,335 --> 00:18:58,336
♪ Aaaaaaaah ♪

00:18:58,336 --> 00:18:58,937
You go back with that.

00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:02,540
In terms of valuation, um,
because of the traction

00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,009
that we've seen,
we would be willing

00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:07,612
to consider a counter dropping
our valuation to $5 million.

00:19:07,612 --> 00:19:09,481
I'll be flexible this way.

00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,583
If I were to agree
to the last round,

00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:12,984
to go back in a round
that you actually had

00:19:12,984 --> 00:19:15,987
a trigger price at $2.2 million,
I would do 17%.

00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:18,490
That is the match to that.
I've already done the math.

00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,525
‐Ooh.
‐So, if you want to bring me

00:19:20,525 --> 00:19:22,761
into the $2.2 million
round valuation,

00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:26,564
I'll do $375,000 there
at 17%.

00:19:26,564 --> 00:19:27,699
That's it, guys.

00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:31,369
We would really love to find
a way to bring you onboard.

00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:32,504
I just gave you a path.

00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,473
As we look at where
our company is, our projections,

00:19:35,473 --> 00:19:37,275
what we are going to sell
in the next 12 months ‐‐

00:19:37,275 --> 00:19:38,443
Guys, I‐I've never seen

00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:40,445
a forecast I haven't
liked, ever.

00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:41,713
They're always fantastic.

00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:43,782
Then I deal with the reality
with all my entrepreneurs

00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:45,650
about how tough it is
to grow a business.

00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:48,486
He's at 17%.
Where are you at?

00:19:48,486 --> 00:19:50,755
What would you do
for $375,000?

00:19:50,755 --> 00:19:53,658
So, we would consider,
um, because we want

00:19:53,658 --> 00:19:54,759
to scale quickly,
uh, if ‐‐ if you...

00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:56,594
All right. Stop selling.
... if you would be willing

00:19:56,594 --> 00:20:01,333
to do $500,000
in exchange for 10%?

00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,901
Not doing that.

00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:05,737
And I admire what you're doing,
and I like your product,

00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:09,808
but I just bring too much value,
and I know what I'm worth.

00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:11,476
‐What do you say?
‐What are you gonna do?

00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:13,645
It's ‐‐ It's a shame,
because we're gonna grow

00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,714
at the rate that
we really feel like you'll be

00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,649
kicking yourself later
for not getting in.

00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,851
We're going to Sprouts,
we're talking to Whole Foods,

00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:21,753
we're going to be
in the big‐box retailers.

00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:23,621
It's ‐‐ It's a matter ‐‐
It's only a matter of time.

00:20:23,621 --> 00:20:24,689
Guys, I have many companies

00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:26,691
that are going through
the process you are.

00:20:26,691 --> 00:20:28,526
The rollout
to Whole Foods national

00:20:28,526 --> 00:20:29,761
is gonna take three years.

00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:32,897
It's a long journey.
You know what?

00:20:32,897 --> 00:20:36,568
I'm okay if you say no,
but I know we'll remember

00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,703
this moment together
about a year from now,

00:20:38,703 --> 00:20:41,439
and you'll say, "I wish I'd done
that deal with Mr. Wonderful."

00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:44,409
I'll do the deal
at $375,000 for 17%,

00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,511
which tags on to
your $2.2 million round.

00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:47,846
You've got good logic to do it.

00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:51,383
You don't have to.
Please decide.

00:20:56,454 --> 00:20:58,490
So, thank you all
for your feedback

00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,891
and for the conversation.

00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:02,494
We think we have
far too good of a product

00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:05,497
and have come too far
in such a fast amount of time,

00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:06,698
and the upside is huge.

00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,566
Uh, so, we politely
and respectfully

00:21:08,566 --> 00:21:10,535
decline your offer.

00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:12,704
That's fine. Thank you
very much for your time.

00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:15,273
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:21:16,574 --> 00:21:18,843
Mr. Wonderful is
absolutely going to regret,

00:21:18,843 --> 00:21:21,846
uh, this ‐‐ this decision
and the offers that he made.

00:21:21,846 --> 00:21:24,783
Um, he's really not going to be
able to sleep well at night

00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,619
after he sees that
we're just gonna continue

00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,621
to make the kind
of progress we already have.

00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,424
Oh, my God. Talk about
overselling themselves.

00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:33,825
‐Divas.
‐I agree, but the pricing

00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,660
made sense at the last round
of $2.2 million,

00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,795
because nothing's happened.
Kevin, Kevin.

00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,897
The only certainty is that
they're not gonna listen.

00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:41,299
Then, Mark, you know
what I have to say?

00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:43,935
They are dead to me.

00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:48,940
Narrator: In Season 6,
David Heath and Randy Goldberg

00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,643
made a deal with Daymond John
for Bombas,

00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,611
their sock company

‐Where do you sell these goods?
‐Wow.

00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:09,573
Uh, 95% of our sales come
from an e‐commerce website,

and then we've got
5% wholesale right now.

00:35:11,408 --> 00:35:12,509
How do you get people

‐So, all through our own site.

followers, Instagram's 116,000.

We look at influencers.

00:35:29,693 --> 00:35:31,795
We look at
affiliate networks.

What makes it go boom?

‐Yep. So about ‐‐
‐I mean, that's a staggering

number in two years.
So, four months later,

00:35:39,536 --> 00:35:41,538
we started kicking out
Facebook advertising,

00:35:41,538 --> 00:35:42,806
and, so, that is where
we started to see

00:35:42,806 --> 00:35:44,708
that really strong growth
and continued.

00:35:44,708 --> 00:35:46,677
And then, you just kept on
ramping it up, 'cause it worked.
Yep.

00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:48,879
How much did you spend
on your advertising?

00:35:48,879 --> 00:35:51,715
Last month, we did about
$430,000 in sales.

00:35:51,715 --> 00:35:54,451
Okay.
Um, we spent about 75 ‐‐

00:35:54,451 --> 00:35:57,454
$75,000 on advertising.

What do you want
the $500,000 for?

00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:01,792
So, we're gonna use it
for investing more in marketing

00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:02,860
but then also

that I won't necessarily use,

on what you've done.

You've taken a cause,

you've ‐‐ you've
made it personal,

and you figured out
what your secret sauce is,

00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:34,892
which is marketing.

00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:38,395
The challenge for me
is that Facebook giveth,

Facebook can taketh away.

00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:42,967
Right? Facebook has made
marketing companies millions,

00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:46,603
and with one policy change,
those millions have disappeared.

00:36:46,603 --> 00:36:49,673
And because of
that risk factor from Facebook,

00:36:49,673 --> 00:36:52,009
I'm gonna say I'm out.

00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:57,414

I'm gonna make you two offers,

between them, okay?

I'm the most creative Shark
in terms of structure,

so the others
will learn from this.
