So, that's ‐‐ that's
really the direction

00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:27,800
we really want to go.

00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,802
Look, Billy, that's taking you
in a whole different direction.

00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:32,605
Right, I don't get the ‐‐
But it's a huge
revenue‐maker for us.

00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:33,673
I see the upside
there, right,

00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:34,807
but that's not what
you came in with, right?

00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,943
You didn't come in and say,
"Look, we are gonna just

00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:40,580
crush it with experiential
classrooms where people get to

00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,681
have fun with wine."

00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:43,816
You came in selling fun
of the experience at home.

00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,685
That is not the path
of least resistance

00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:48,321
in any way, shape, or form.

00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:50,656
I'm out.

00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:53,226
I thought
you were selling fun.

00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,327
Of course we are!

00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:54,961
Somewhere along the way,

00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:57,697
the end‐user goal was
to sell a bottle of wine.

00:14:57,697 --> 00:14:59,599
Then, I heard
wine classes.

00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:01,000
Then, I heard
the hospitality business.

00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,836
But it sounds to me like
you're going in many directions.

00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,872
Don't waste
your breath on me.

00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:10,209
It's just not a business
that I understand or enjoy.

00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,578
I'm out.

00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,679
You came in here ‐‐

00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,715
I kind of thought this was
a party‐favor kit.

00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:18,451
And you are having
a great experience for that.

00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:19,852
Let me tell you,
that great experience ‐‐

00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,487
I almost wanted
to kiss Kevin.

00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,189
That's how happy I became.

00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:23,790
[ Laughs ]

00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,558
What do I pay for
my case of wine?

00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:27,860
Once I develop my own wine,
I want to get it.

00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,496
So, if you're ‐‐ if you're
buying a full case of your wine,

00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:33,699
uh, you're looking at $300.

00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,468
‐Ouch!
‐Wow.

00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:36,736
‐Wait a minute.
‐Billy, how many bottles

00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,204
in a case?
‐So what's in ‐‐ yeah.

00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:38,805
12 bottles.

00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:41,641
‐Is that a lot?
‐$25 a bottle.

00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:44,510
But if I've done that party
in my home that I just did,

00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,480
what percentage of those folks
order a case of wine?

00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,516
Currently, the purchase rate
is about 15%.

00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:53,352
I think 15% is
a terrible conversion rate

00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:54,821
on something like that.

00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:57,723
I don't see you selling
a lot of wine so sadly,

00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:59,592
I've enjoyed the party,
sweetheart,

00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:02,195
[clicks tongue]
but I'm out.

00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,732
Billy, I spend a ton
of time in the wine business.

00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:07,967
It's a tough business.

00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:17,944
And 97% in America of wine is
sold for under $13.90 a bottle.

00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:23,082
You will never sell wine
for over 14 bucks a bottle.

00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,628
Narrator: Three Sharks are out,
and Kevin is concerned

00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:37,497
about the high price point

00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,500
for Billy's wine
novelty product, Blendtique.

00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,802
‐$25 a bottle.
‐Ouch.

00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:47,773
You will never sell wine
for over 14 bucks a bottle.

00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:48,841
You have to remember though,

00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,543
this is really
a hand‐craft item.

00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:51,711
‐I get it.
‐Yeah, but people don't

00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,845
respect that or appreciate that.

00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,780
You should've captured me
in this business.

00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,015
I mean, my goodness.
But when I saw

00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,884
what you were selling it...
I don't think it's too late.

00:16:57,884 --> 00:16:59,685
I really believe that you'll...
No, no, it's too late.

00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,255
I'm out.
I'm out, I'm out.

00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,691
What I'm sitting here
thinking about is,

00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,527
I love it as a gift.

00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:08,928
I love it as something
that people can do

00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:11,364
as an experience together
just to have fun.

00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:11,898
Of course.

00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:14,600
But my concern is
your price point.

00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,637
Can you get this down
to $49.99?

00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:20,706
Yes.
And then, can you
get your bottle to,

00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:24,877
I don't know,
$13 a bottle?

00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:29,549
I would say if we ship it
direct to the consumer, 100%.

00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:33,352
Um, I'll give you
a flyer, Billy.

00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:34,420
I'll give you a chance.

00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,588
‐Oh, great!
‐A flyer!

00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:38,558
I'll give you $250,000
for 30%.

00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,660
‐Ouch.
‐That's a little high.

00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,727
It's a little steep.

00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,696
So, I have a partner.
Yeah.

00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:49,302
He would want me to counter
with, um, $250,000 for 15%.

00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:50,770
I like you, Billy.

00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,673
I'm taking a chance, 'cause
there's a lot of "ifs."

00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:55,675
I know I can help you.

00:17:55,675 --> 00:18:02,381
The lowest I'll go ‐‐
I will go $250,000 for 25%.

00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,483
It's up to you.

00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,619
You need a workhorse.

00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:09,555
I'm a Clydesdale.

00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:14,794
So, my investor is actually
a bit of a Shark himself.

00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:17,630
He's been in it with me
from the get‐go.

00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,532
The only thing I could
consider doing would be

00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:21,534
to dilute my shares beyond
what he is offering

00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:22,635
to dilute on his side.

00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:23,903
‐What are your shares, Billy?
‐That's a commitment

00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:25,538
right there.
‐'Cause I don't want to do

00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:26,572
something that is
wrong for you.

00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:27,873
I own 49%.

00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:32,378
So, if you would be willing
to meet in the middle

00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:34,780
at $250,000 for 20%,

00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,683
I would dilute my remaining
percentage down

00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:40,353
to meet you at that level.

00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:48,628
What if I do this
where I give you a loan?

00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:51,664
I give you
a $250,000 loan.

00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:56,469
I take 8% interest,
10% equity.

00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,005
‐There you go.
‐And I do it like that.

00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:04,977
That's a lot better than
it sounds 'cause you get her.

00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:14,253
I would like
to do that deal with you.

00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:15,354
‐Yes!
‐Yay!

00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:16,522
Mazel Tov!

00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:19,325
‐Let's have a drink!
‐Yay, whoo!

00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,526
What did I tell you?

00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,662
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:23,696
It's a great gift.
It's super fun.

00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:24,830
Thank you, guys.

00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,233
‐Thank you, guys.
‐Thank you very much.

00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:28,934
Thanks, Billy.

00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:31,671
Dim: So, having Lori on board,
being able to really

00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,973
highlight and market and share
the product with the world

00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:36,909
just because of her exposure
and being who she is

00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:41,147
and her relationships ‐‐
it's gonna be invaluable to us.

00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,353
Herjavec:
I was born in Croatia,

00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:48,487
which was a Communist country

00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:49,855
when I was there
called Yugoslavia.

00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:53,592
We had dirt floors and hay
and no running water

00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:56,829
for a long time,
but it never seemed bad

00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:58,831
'cause I was a little kid,
and my grandmother,

00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:01,867
lots of family,
dogs, cats, horses.

00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,869
You never know the situation
you grow up in

00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:08,340
until you compare it
to something else.

00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,609
Yugoslavia was a great country,

00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,712
if you were part
of the Communist Party.

00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,714
My dad was very anti‐Communist,

00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,616
and would say all kinds
of bad things about Communism.

00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:19,719
And he got thrown in jail
22 times,

00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,921
and the last time
he got thrown in, he was told,

00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:24,824
"If you come back,
you will never return."

00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:27,593
He packed a suitcase,
grabbed my mom and me,

00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:30,429
and we crossed the border
to Italy, got on a boat,

00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,965
and came to Canada.

00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:36,869
In Yugoslavia,
my dad was such a happy guy.

00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:39,538
He was a manager,
and he was pretty up there.

00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:41,574
He was well‐respected
for what he did.

00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,509
He then he comes to Canada,

00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:45,544
and he's sweeping floors
in a factory.

00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:47,580
He was never the same.

00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,014
I think I'm like
every other kid.

00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:55,654
You never appreciate your
parents un‐‐ until they're gone.

00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:58,390
And I just think
how hard he worked

00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,659
to give me that opportunity.

00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:06,265
And I just feel such a need
to justify that sacrifice.

00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,702
I had lots of dreams
when I was growing up.

00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:13,472
I wanted to be a detective,
a vet, a race car driver.

00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:14,807
I was so unfocused.

00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:17,843
My best friend went for this
interview at a computer company,

00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:20,479
and I'm thinking,
"Computers ‐‐ who cares?

00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:21,614
Boring!"

00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:25,417
Until he says
the starting salary is $30,000.

00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:26,685
I'm like, "What?"

00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:28,454
And he says,
"Well, I didn't get the job.

00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:29,588
Here's the guy's number.
Call him."

00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:31,657
That's how I got started
in the computer business.

00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,592
The Herjavec Group
is one of the world's

00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,694
largest
cyber‐security companies.

00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:37,496
I'm really passionate about it,

00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:40,466
because it feels like
we do good.

00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:43,435
I really think
the world is changing.

00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:45,571
The Internet has a lot of good,

00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:47,439
but it has a lot
of potential bad.

00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,542
And by protecting companies,

00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:53,045
we're making the world
a safer place.

00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:56,515
I think what makes me different
than the other Sharks

00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,484
is I'm an actual immigrant.

00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,486
I actually came here on a boat.

00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:03,589
That shapes a lot of
how I think and who I am.

00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:05,591
People think today,
"Oh, I can't get ahead.

00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:06,792
It's really hard."

00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:09,662
Yeah, damn right it's really
hard, and it should be hard.

00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:12,565
Entrepreneurship
is the great equalizer.

00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:14,567
It's not about
who your parents are.

00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:15,768
It's not about your color.

00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:18,571
It's not about you sex.
It's not about your religion.

00:22:18,571 --> 00:22:20,506
You know, business
doesn't really care.

00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:23,876
Business only cares about
the value that you add.

00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:27,513
I'm proud of
the success I've had,

00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:30,416
but only in the sense
that it justifies

00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:32,685
the sacrifice from my parents.

00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,954
To work that hard
and go through that much pain,

00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:37,990
and then for me to squander
it and not do something

00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:43,162

00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:07,453
Hi.
I'm Mark Bernstein.

00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:08,621
I'm from San Francisco,

00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:11,557
and I'm the founder
and C. E. O. of MealEnders.

00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:17,396
We're seeking $350,000
for 8% of our company.

00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,531
Sharks, it happens all the time.

00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:21,533
We say we're gonna
control our weight,

00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:22,635
but the next thing we know,

00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:25,437
we're going for seconds
and even thirds.

00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:26,839
We know overeating is bad,

00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:29,575
but it's hard to
control ourselves sometimes.

00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,043
Until now.

00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:34,680
MealEnders are a totally new
approach to weight management.

master portion control,
and curb snacking.

00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:49,528
Each MealEnder has two layers ‐‐
an outer reward layer

00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:51,797
which provides
a measured dose of dessert

00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:55,634
to cue the end of a meal
and satisfy snack cravings.

00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:59,672
The inner cooling and tingling
core clears your palette

00:23:59,672 --> 00:24:02,641
and transitions your focus
away from eating

00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:05,744

00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:05,637

the cooling core,

Oh, it's burning
a little.

00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:20,986
Well, hopefully
that's tingling.

00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:24,656
‐It's like a chilly...
‐It leaves kind of a funky taste

00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:25,991
on your tongue.
‐Well, remember, the obje‐‐

00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:29,495

is making me not want

00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:30,763
to put anything else

00:25:30,763 --> 00:25:32,064
‐Exactly.
‐... because my tongue feels

00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:34,833
funny, and it's like it kills
your taste buds, right?

00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,568
Well, some people
love the taste.

00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:37,636
It's getting
really strong now.

00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:38,837

This is the end of the date,

Cuban: Yeah, she's sticking
that thing in your mouth,

00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:48,647
and it's like when
you brush your teeth

00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:50,516
and she's got morning breath.
Let me tell you how it works,

00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:51,617
but I want to tell you
one data point.

00:25:51,617 --> 00:25:53,485
We've been in the market
for a year and a half.

00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:54,787
We've had less than 2% returns.

00:25:54,787 --> 00:25:56,588
We have 100% satisfaction
guarantee.

00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:58,557
What's your sales
in a year and a half?

00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,859
$1.4 million.

00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,928
‐You've done $1.4 million!
‐Where are you selling?

00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:05,731
Yeah, only on our website
and on Amazon.

00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,599
What can you sell
this for online?

00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,768
So, it depends on
what quantity you buy it in ‐‐

00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:12,971
anywhere from
$16.95 for one bag,

00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:15,707
and if you buy in quantity
on a continuity plan,

00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:17,709
it goes down to $8.99.
‐It's pretty pricey,

00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:18,844
but you know what
I like about it?

00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:21,680
I sat here trying to think,
"What would I like to eat

00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,549
right now to get rid of
that bad taste?"

00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:25,884
And I couldn't
think of a single thing.

00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:28,620
Right.
And that's a cool little trick

00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,656
for people who like
to overeat.

00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:31,790
Are you a scientist?
What's going on?

00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,692
‐I am not a scientist.
‐How did you create this?

00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:34,893
I am someone who
needed the product.

00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:36,929
I started going to the doctor
every year as I got older,

00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,864
which I'm sure many of you
might have experienced.

00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:41,366
So, doctor would look at
one number and say,

00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:43,635
"Why don't you lose 10 pounds?"

00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:45,637
So I became more conscious
of my own eating,

00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:47,773
and I experienced
that my problem was stopping.

00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,675
And so I started looking for

00:26:49,675 --> 00:26:51,076
some product that would
help me stop.

00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:53,812
And I had the idea, and I said,
"Boy, if somebody could develop

00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:56,348
something like that,
that would be a great business."

00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:57,916
So I went and engaged

00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:00,486
the leading food‐development
company in the country.

00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:02,321
Mark, how much weight
did you lose on this?

00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:04,223
I lost 15 pounds.

00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:04,723
And you've kept it off?

00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:07,693
Yeah, and for me,
it's mindfulness.

00:27:07,693 --> 00:27:09,928
Okay, tell me what
the customers are saying.

00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:12,898
So, we did a test with
a third‐party testing arm,

00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:15,634
and the results there came back
better than we had hoped.

00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,437
Over 75% stopped eating sooner,

00:27:18,437 --> 00:27:20,439
avoided snacking,
and lost weight.

00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:21,707
So you're not ‐‐ you know,
so you could've...

00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:24,643
We've had 6,000 reorders,
21% of our...

00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,545
But does it have to
taste like that?

00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:27,946
Well, everyone's
taste is different.

00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:29,715
There's a reason why you walk
into a restaurant...

00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:31,483
21% of your people reordered,
is what you're saying?

00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,718
So far.

00:27:32,718 --> 00:27:34,486
Greiner:
How much have you invested?

00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,722
My family has,
uh, $200,000 in it.

00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:38,557
Anybody else, or do we
have any other investors?

00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:39,825
Yeah, we've done
a convertible note round,

00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:42,261
and we've raised,
uh, $1.1 million.

00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:42,828
‐Ooh!
‐Wow!

00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:44,329
‐Wow.
‐Including my money.

00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:44,930
Have you made a profit

00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,899
from the very beginning
till now, at all?

00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:49,801
Uh, we haven't been running
the business to run a profit.

00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:52,437
Over the last few months, we've
had some profitable months,

00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:53,705
but basically we're putting
everything back.

00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:54,907
‐How much did you ‐‐
‐We're trying to grow

00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:56,742
the top line, because
we know that the power...

00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:58,477
So, you're reinvesting
in advertising?

00:27:58,477 --> 00:28:00,612
We're now doing
significant advertising.

00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:04,216
Specifically, what were
your sales last month?

00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:05,050
$170,000.

00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:09,788
And this month will be close
to $175,000 or north of there.

00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:13,859
Okay. And what have you spent
on advertising per month?

00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:17,296
Probably, uh, about
half ‐‐ half of that.

00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:18,430
Half of that number?

00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,565
‐Wow.
‐Wow.

00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:20,499
‐Wow.
‐Or a little bit less.

00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:21,466
What we're doing is ‐‐

00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,535
But still,
anything close, right?

00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,604
21% reordering
is horrible.

00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:27,673
It's horrific.
This should be viral.

00:28:27,673 --> 00:28:29,408
Well, we think it is
starting to get viral.

00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:30,709
No, it can't.
It's not viral if you have to

00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,077
spend half your revenue
in advertising.

00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:34,479
Look, we're a brand‐new company
that no one's ever heard of.

00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:35,581
No, you're not.
You're 18 months in,

00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:36,748
and you have over
a million dollars in sales.

00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,750
Well, we didn't start
advertising till later.

00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,719
This should be the most
viral product ever.

00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:44,523
If just one person
loses 15 pounds,

00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:45,724
what are they gonna do?

00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,559
They're gonna
get asked by everybody,

00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,294
"What did you do?
What did you do?

00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:50,596
What did you do," right?

00:28:50,596 --> 00:28:52,864
I ‐‐ I think you've
got a good idea.

00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,766
I see what you're
trying to accomplish.

00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:57,369
But you don't have
the solution yet.

00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:59,871
I'm out.

00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:02,708
Everybody in the world
wants to be rich,

00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:04,543
and everybody in the world
wants to be thin.

00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:06,645
But very few people
want to put the effort in.

00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:09,248
So, when you have
a trigger point,

00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:09,815
I think it really helps.

00:29:09,815 --> 00:29:12,451
And I think you're
really on to something.

00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:13,719
Here's what I don't
like about it.

00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:17,556
It's kind of in the supplement,
diet kind of business.

00:29:17,556 --> 00:29:20,792
You're gonna spend
a fortune to get the word out,

00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:24,463
and then one day, there's
a hot new thing out there.

00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:26,031
I don't like
that business.

00:29:26,031 --> 00:29:28,800
I wish you all the best,
but I think you're gonna burn

00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,535
a lot of money
to get to scale.

00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:31,603
I'm out.

00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,938
Can I share a couple
of facts with you?

00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:35,941
One, the scale
of this problem is enormous.

00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,743
Yeah, we know that,
but that's not the challenge.

00:29:37,743 --> 00:29:38,810
Mark, let me take
a stab at it.

00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,846
‐Okay.
‐You know, this is the first

00:29:40,846 --> 00:29:45,417
weight‐reduction product that's
ever come on to "Shark Tank"

00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:48,320
and not been just
torn to shreds.

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:48,954
Yeah, true.

00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:51,723

I personally don't like

I wish you good luck,

00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:22,688
this isn't a product that
I feel very confident about.

My experience on my tongue

00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,803
was terrific,
and psychologically, I get it.

00:30:37,803 --> 00:30:41,540
I'm amazed at your sales,
but you've infused the business

00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,675
with a lot of cash,
and I think your

00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,311
just getting started
is gonna take too much money

00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:46,978

We actually have people
who are interested in investing.

00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,549

00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:54,219
although I love
your product, I'm out.

In L. A. alone, there are

in a small fishing village.

as actual like shelter,

00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:15,854
we now gave them

00:34:15,854 --> 00:34:17,055

At the same time, they promote
it to their, like, PR side.

So, transporting
the material from us,

00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:25,797

To make a wallet ‐‐ that's our

00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:43,448
it's $2, and we wholesale

Guys, how do you
communicate the message?

00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:47,786
'Cause the reality is,
if you just look at that,

00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:49,621
you have no idea
that it's a billboard.

00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:51,556
And then, when you just
feel it, you know,

00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:52,657
if you didn't know
it was a billboard,

00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,459
you'd be like,

I feel, about Rareform,

00:34:56,695 --> 00:34:57,762
is they love
the story behind it.

00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,531
And that's the biggest thing
we have is trouble

00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:00,632
is telling that story
to our new...

00:35:00,632 --> 00:35:01,666
Right, and that's

00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:02,767
the big question.
‐Who's telling it?

00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,536
Who's telling it for you?
So, on our website, you know,

00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:05,737
we tell it on our website ‐‐
it's pretty easy.

00:35:05,737 --> 00:35:06,871
But in‐store, we have
to come out with

00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:09,574
the best displays possible
to help tell that story ‐‐

00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:10,742
any kind of
point‐of‐purchases displays.

00:35:10,742 --> 00:35:12,644
Well, I don't see anything
there. What do you guys do?

00:35:12,644 --> 00:35:13,778
So, for us right now,
like, for example,

00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:17,382
these are in every Quicksilver
store ‐‐ a wallet display.

00:35:17,382 --> 00:35:18,617
And these turn great for us.

00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:19,784
What are your sales?

00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,419
That's a great question.
So far...

00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:22,654
I think it's a very good
question.

00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:23,722
I like it a lot, actually.

00:35:23,722 --> 00:35:24,856
Yeah, it is
a good one.

00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:27,359
We've done $1.1 million
in sales.

00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,460
Over what period of time?

00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,628
This is our third year
in business.

00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,630
So, what did you do
in the last 12 months?

00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,698
Last 12 months,
we did $700,000.

00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:35,000
But you guys are
making money then, right?

00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,570
Because your margins are decent,
and $700,000 in sales.

00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,838
No, so, last year,
we actually took a loss.

00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:42,374
‐You did?
‐Yeah, we took a $130,000 loss.

00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:43,441
‐Why?
‐Why?

00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:44,509
‐Damn!
‐Because we were

00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:45,610
manufacturing products
still in the U. S.,

00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:46,845
so it wasn't until
the last four months

00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:49,614
that we moved to Mexico
and have cut our costs down.

00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:51,483
For example, like Aric
was saying on the surfbag,

00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:52,784
it was costing us $28.

00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:54,419
‐And what's it costing now?
‐Now, $12.

00:35:54,419 --> 00:35:55,587
‐$12.
‐And your wholesale

00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:57,255
for the surfbag is...
‐$40.

00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:57,756
So a 70% mark‐up.

00:35:57,756 --> 00:35:59,557
Right, so you've got
70% margins.

00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:00,892
Yes.
So last month,
you should've made money.

00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:03,028
Yeah, we did. Actually, it was
a turning point in our company.

00:36:03,028 --> 00:36:05,430
‐How much did you make?
‐Uh, I think it was like, 5K.

00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,565
‐Yeah!
‐Yeah!

00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:08,900
Where'd you get the money
to absorb the loss?

00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,735
So, in the beginning,
I put in $60,000,

00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:11,870
and Aric put in $20,000.
I put in $20,000.

00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,805
Do you have
any other investors?

00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:17,542
Yeah, we first raised around
$200,000 prior to revenue.

00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,444
From family and friends,
or from whom?

00:36:19,444 --> 00:36:20,512
Uh. from family
and friends, yeah.

00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:21,479
What did
you value that at?

00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:22,547
What was the value of business

00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:23,815
after they put the $200,000 in?

00:36:23,815 --> 00:36:26,551
Uh, I want
to say it was at ‐‐

00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:29,688
I'm not totally sure
on that number.

00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:30,755
You should know that.

00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:32,824
‐$105,000.
‐How much equity did they get?

00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:34,559
‐They got 30% equity.
‐How much do you have?

00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,494
‐They got 30%?
‐And then, you guys split

00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:37,662
the 70% equally?

00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:40,065
Right now, Alec and I own
around 40% of the company.

00:36:40,065 --> 00:36:43,435
So, the value of the business
was $600,000 on that.

00:36:43,435 --> 00:36:44,536
We actually just raised
another round,

00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:46,371
and it was at
a $2.5 million valuation.

00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:49,407
Oh!
$2.5 million for this?

00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:50,475
How much did you raise?

00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:52,477
$150,000.
Wow.

00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:54,612
You're asking me to give you
$300,000 for 10%

00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:56,614
impugning a $3 million value.

00:36:56,614 --> 00:37:00,452
No chance in hell
it's worth $3 million.

00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:01,586
Another big aspect
for our business

00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:02,654
that we haven't talked on

00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:04,556
is that we have
a corporate business.

00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,624
We just got a first P. O.
from one of the largest

00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:07,692
theme parks in the world.

00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:11,329
Um, here's my thing.
You don't own enough stock.

00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:11,963
I feel like at this point,

00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:15,266
you've sold off a chunk of
your business again and again.

00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:15,934
That concerns me.

00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:17,602
All right, I don't
think there's enough room

00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,537
for another person to come in
and take a bite.

00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:21,272
So, I'm out.

00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:21,873
All right.

00:37:21,873 --> 00:37:23,508
Appreciate it.
It's your personal touch

00:37:23,508 --> 00:37:25,543
that has a lot to do
with what's going on,

00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:26,845
and that's very hard to scale.

00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:29,614
And you're not asking
for $100,000

00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:30,782
for 30% of your business.

00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:33,551
You're asking for a valuation
for a real company

00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:35,820
that needs to grow
into very significant profits

00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,689
in order for me
to get my money back.

00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:40,291
‐Yeah.
‐So, for those reasons, I'm out.

00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:41,926
Thank you for your time.

00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,662
Listen, you've done
$1.1 million in three years,

00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:46,397
so nobody can scoff at that.

00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:47,031
That's really good.

00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:51,269
And I do love that the, um,
environmentally‐friendly

00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,437
piece of it, which is great.

00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:53,505
You're recycling these.

00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:55,807
But, because it's ever‐changing,

00:37:55,807 --> 00:37:57,809
you're never gonna have
two of the same twice.

00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:00,879
It's a bad thing, because if
I see yours and I love it,

00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:04,616
and I want one, I can't
get one because they're unique.

00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:07,318
And so, for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,756
If part of your deal
in getting these billboards

00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:14,459
was some kind of a license
or a contract

00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:17,629
where you could
market them that way,

00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,697
then you have a unique,
sustainable position.

00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:23,234
But a $3 million value
and not having that in place ‐‐

00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:24,502
I don't see it.

00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:26,204
I'm out.

00:38:27,372 --> 00:38:29,340
Okay, guys, that leaves me.

00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,909
I like you guys.
You're grinders.

00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:34,646
But the biggest problem
with your deal is the valuation

00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:37,382
and the fact you don't
own much equity anymore.

00:38:37,382 --> 00:38:37,916
You're not worth $3 million.

00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:39,617
I don't care what
other people paid for it.

00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:40,752
You're not profitable yet.

00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:42,720
Um, here's the only way
to do this.

00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,591
I'm gonna offer you
$300,000 as debt,

00:38:46,591 --> 00:38:49,093
8% interest rate, 36 months.
That's three years.

00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:51,796
That's enough to prove out
your model and get sales going,

00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:53,832
and you're gonna
give me 10% equity,

00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:56,267
which you offered
when you walked in the Tank.

00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:58,403
That's the only deal here,

00:38:58,403 --> 00:38:59,637
and it's the only one
you've got.

00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:01,506
You got to make a decision.

00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,208
What do you want to do?

00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:13,751
Narrator:
Four Sharks are out.

00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:16,888
Kevin is Aric and Alec's
last chance for a deal

00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:20,892
for their bags made from
recycled billboards, Rareform.

00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:23,761
I'm gonna offer you
$300,000 as debt,

00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:26,898
8% interest rate, 36 months.
That's three years.

00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:29,701
That's enough to prove out
your model and get sales going,

00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,669
and you're gonna give me
10% equity,

00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:33,605
which you offered when
you walked in the Tank.

00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:37,508
That's the only deal here,
and it's the only you've got.

00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:39,277
You got to make a decision.

00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:40,778
What do you want to do?

00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:43,281
What if we were to do it ‐‐
just structure it as a ‐‐

00:39:43,281 --> 00:39:43,781
an equity deal instead?

00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:44,849
And what if we moved
the percentage?

00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,684
It is an equity deal.
I'm getting 10%.

00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:48,720
15%, yeah.
But I'm loaning you the money.

00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,055
You are not ‐‐ guys, you're just
not worth 3 million bucks.

00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:54,559
You're also very quick to give
away stock ‐‐ bam, like that.

00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,828
That's scary.

00:39:56,828 --> 00:39:58,730
For us, I mean,
we didn't have any other way

00:39:58,730 --> 00:39:59,731
to start the business.
For us...

00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:01,699
You know, if it was
straight equity,

00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:05,670
I would ask for about
40% of your company, okay?

00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,005
And if you do that,

00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:09,807
you simply don't own enough
to get up and go to work.

00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:12,277
I don't want to do that.
That's not good for me.

00:40:12,277 --> 00:40:13,011
It's useless.

00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:15,780
Once I loan you money, I'm at
risk, do you understand that?

00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,715
I've got to get it back.
I don't want you to fail.

00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:18,950
No, we understand it.
I think the big thing for me

00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,852
is the balloon payment.
I think, I mean, I would like

00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,620
to have it, you know,
kicked back like, five months.

00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,655
When you borrow money,
my friend,

00:40:23,655 --> 00:40:25,590
you got to pay it back one day.

00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,825
How much do you
need the cash today?

00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:29,494
I mean, right now,
we're at a place

00:40:29,494 --> 00:40:30,695
where we do need the cash,
'cause we're ‐‐

00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:32,664
If you need the cash,
it's a great offer.

00:40:32,664 --> 00:40:34,565
It's not a balloon payment.
You're paying it along the way.

00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:35,667
Everybody's gonna
charge you that.

00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:37,602
I'm not gonna do something
that hurts the business

00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:38,703
that I'm trying
to support.

00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:39,871
‐Yeah.
‐That's stupid money.

00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:41,873
I'm not stupid.
I know how to lend money.

00:40:41,873 --> 00:40:43,474
Corcoran:
I think he's being overpaid.

00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:46,277
You just think about that,
young man.

00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,612
He gets a kicker at the end,

00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:49,681
he takes a chunk
of your business ‐‐ 10%.

00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:51,482
You don't own
a lot already.

00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:52,750
And he's being overpaid
on the interest,

00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,619
even though he's positioning it
as a great deal.

00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:55,620
You think 8%
is being overpaid?

00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,621
Yes.
Barbara, why don't you

00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:57,689
make an offer
if you're so generous?

00:40:57,689 --> 00:40:59,624
‐I'm not!
‐It's the only offer, Barbara.

00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,693
What's going through
your heads right now?

00:41:01,693 --> 00:41:03,661
I think that, you know,
the 8% interest is pretty high.

00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:05,330
What if we were to get it
somewhere down 5%?

00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:06,397
It's not high.

00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:07,832
I ‐‐ are you kidding?

00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:09,767
Have you tried to factor
any of your receivables yet?

00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:11,369
He says he does.
Yeah, we have a factor.

00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:12,570
What are you getting for it?
6%.

00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:13,771
I don't believe it.
I'd like to see those terms.

00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:15,740
‐If we show you those terms ‐‐
‐I do not believe you, actually.

00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,908
‐We'll show you the terms.
‐There you go.

00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:18,776
‐There's your counter.
‐So you're saying that you can

00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:21,346
go do the very same thing
at 6% right now.

00:41:21,346 --> 00:41:22,413
‐Yeah.
‐Zero interest.

00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:24,182
You're just not worth it yet.

00:41:24,182 --> 00:41:25,416
No, thanks.

00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:26,417
What are you gonna do?

00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,419
What do you feel
in your gut?

00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:34,392
By the way, I didn't say ‐‐
and you probably know this ‐‐

00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:35,727
I'm extremely valuable.

00:41:35,727 --> 00:41:36,928
I'm Mr. Wonderful.

00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:38,663
‐You got to deal with him.
‐Oh, my God.

00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:40,498
He didn't say
valuable to <i>who.</i>

00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:41,799
Oh, my God.
Let me get the shovel.

00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:43,568
Ask any of my entrepreneurs,
any of them.

00:41:43,568 --> 00:41:46,070
They ‐‐ I am Mr. Wonderful
to them.

00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,206
Uh...

00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:52,810
Let's do it.

00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,612
Wow, you're gonna
regret that one.

00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:55,713
‐Hey!
‐What?

00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:58,616
Okay, guys. I think
you made a wise decision.

00:41:58,616 --> 00:42:00,651
I'm not kidding.
Thank you.

00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:02,754
Remember, you're gonna have to
look at that face every day.

00:42:02,754 --> 00:42:05,356
Congratulations, guys.
Good luck.

00:42:06,491 --> 00:42:09,127
Whoo!
All right!

00:42:10,495 --> 00:42:11,629
Whoo!

how to run the business

00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,632
more efficiently,
more effectively,

00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:15,833
and having somebody
with that wisdom

00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:16,934
that we can call on
and talk with

00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:18,803
is really just gonna be
a game‐changer for us.

00:42:18,803 --> 00:42:20,405
And he seems like
a great man, too.

00:42:20,405 --> 00:42:21,372
I kind of want
to party with him.

00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,373
Yeah.

00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,574
I want to rub
that bald head of his.

00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:25,209
Just rub that thing.
