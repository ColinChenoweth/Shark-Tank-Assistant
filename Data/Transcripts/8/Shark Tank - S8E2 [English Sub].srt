00:13:44,555 --> 00:13:45,923
I've watched you
for seven years,

00:13:45,923 --> 00:13:48,225
and I feel like you've been
my silent partners on this.

00:13:48,225 --> 00:13:51,095
Okay, enough sucking up.
[ Laughs ]
I know. I am.

00:13:51,095 --> 00:13:53,898
So, I'm really here
for the strategic partnerships.

00:13:53,898 --> 00:13:56,133
What element of strategy
do you need help with?

00:13:56,133 --> 00:13:58,903
First off, opening up
larger big‐box retailers.

00:13:58,903 --> 00:14:01,839
The big thing is conveying
in a retail store

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,007
how this works, right?
Because you ‐‐

00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,675
Exactly.
This is my biggest challenge.

00:14:04,675 --> 00:14:06,143
I'm not sure
the packaging does that.

00:14:06,143 --> 00:14:08,913
Seeing it up there, it wasn't
clear what the benefit was.

00:14:08,913 --> 00:14:12,816
I 100% agree there's opportunity
to tweak the packaging.

00:14:12,816 --> 00:14:14,919
That is why I'm probably
the most nervous

00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:16,153
about going in big‐box stores

00:14:16,153 --> 00:14:19,590
is that if it doesn't sell
through, I got one shot at it.

00:14:20,624 --> 00:14:21,892
Leslie, I'll get
the ball rolling.

00:14:21,892 --> 00:14:23,661
I think
it's a great product.

00:14:23,661 --> 00:14:24,862
‐Okay.
‐Congratulations.

00:14:24,862 --> 00:14:26,730
‐Thank you.
‐450K doing all this.

00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,032
You're a force of nature.
‐Wow.

00:14:28,032 --> 00:14:30,868
But in terms of trying to take
a force of nature

00:14:30,868 --> 00:14:32,136
and turn that into a company

00:14:32,136 --> 00:14:34,939
and get through all
the blocking and tackling,

00:14:34,939 --> 00:14:38,609
I don't think I'm the
best‐suited person for that.

00:14:38,609 --> 00:14:40,344
I'm out.

00:14:41,946 --> 00:14:44,048
Mark is right.
You are a force of nature.

00:14:44,048 --> 00:14:46,850
You have such an incredibly
pleasant personality,

00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,819
and you have
all the right answers.

00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:50,054
It's fantastic.

00:14:50,054 --> 00:14:51,722
Look, when I was
a little kid,

00:14:51,722 --> 00:14:53,023
somebody made me cut
between the lines

00:14:53,023 --> 00:14:55,059
and they moved stuff up
on the wall and I messed it up

00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:56,794
and the other kids
made fun of me.

00:14:56,794 --> 00:14:58,429
It's a horrible memory.

00:14:58,429 --> 00:14:58,929
‐Aw.
‐Ohh!

00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:02,700
I'm just not the arts‐crafts
kind of guy.

00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,369
Not for me. I'm out.

00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:10,608
So, I can see you have, like,
crazy drive, like I do.

00:15:10,608 --> 00:15:11,942
And there is no force equal,

00:15:11,942 --> 00:15:14,945
in my mind, to a woman
that's determined to rise.

00:15:14,945 --> 00:15:17,381
So I'm gonna give you
an offer.

00:15:17,381 --> 00:15:18,449
Oh, my gosh.

00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:25,089
I'm gonna give you $100,000,
but it would be for 20%.

00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:27,925
I think I can help you get
into Bed Bath &amp; Beyond

00:15:27,925 --> 00:15:32,563
and Staples and all the places
where this needs to go.

00:15:34,531 --> 00:15:35,699
You all have superpowers.

00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:37,668
If there was actually
an opportunity

00:15:37,668 --> 00:15:38,969
to get a super team
going...

00:15:38,969 --> 00:15:40,804
‐Lori is not enough for you?
‐I'll tell you what I'll do.

00:15:40,804 --> 00:15:42,039
Lori knows ‐‐ She's Queen
of QVC, Queen of Retail.

00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:43,774
Just to give ‐‐ Leslie, I'll
give you some leverage.

00:15:43,774 --> 00:15:45,342
But I'll tell you, Leslie,
you'll have to tell me now

00:15:45,342 --> 00:15:49,146
because I can see
what this is like here.
Leslie, do you want to hear
another offer or not?

00:15:49,146 --> 00:15:52,616
Lori, in the adhesive space,
who's the number‐one maker?

00:15:52,616 --> 00:15:54,151
I'd like you to answer now.

00:15:54,151 --> 00:15:56,787
‐Lori. Lori.
‐Wait, wait, do not do that

00:15:56,787 --> 00:15:58,055
because it'll give you
some leverage.

00:15:58,055 --> 00:15:59,790
Don't do that.
Don't do that.

00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,892
‐Your packaging...
‐Yeah.

00:16:01,892 --> 00:16:03,861
‐...needs a lot of help.
‐I'm open.

00:16:03,861 --> 00:16:05,629
You know what?

00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:07,031
And that's
my sweet spot, so...

00:16:07,031 --> 00:16:09,900
I'd like to make sure that
I hear all the offers first.

00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,869
‐Well...
‐I want you to know

00:16:11,869 --> 00:16:14,605
that I will not make a rash
decision when we're partners.

00:16:14,605 --> 00:16:16,540
She is a sweet talker.

00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,475
Wow!
You are good!

00:16:18,475 --> 00:16:19,843
It's all smart stuff,

00:16:19,843 --> 00:16:21,979
but do you feel I'm the right
partner for you?

00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:24,214
‐You know, so, I'm doing it ‐‐
‐I'm so surprised by this.

00:16:24,214 --> 00:16:27,151
Leslie, you either have to take
my offer or it may go away.

00:16:27,151 --> 00:16:30,354
Leslie, do you want to hear
other offers or not?

00:16:37,327 --> 00:16:38,762
Narrator:
Two Sharks are out.

00:16:38,762 --> 00:16:41,531
Leslie has one offer
on the table from Lori

00:16:41,531 --> 00:16:44,300
for her magnetic picture hangers
GoodHangups.

00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,702
But she may jeopardize the deal

00:16:45,702 --> 00:16:48,438
by waiting to hear
from Kevin and Daymond.

00:16:48,438 --> 00:16:52,242
Lori, I 100% agree you are
the right partner for me.

00:16:52,242 --> 00:16:53,376
I do need to hear out
the room.

00:16:53,376 --> 00:16:54,644
‐Bird in the hand.
‐You do.

00:16:54,644 --> 00:16:56,579
‐It is. It is. It is.
‐Bird in the hand!

00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:58,415
It is, but believe me, Lori,
I'll make this work.

00:16:58,415 --> 00:17:00,417
‐Leslie, I'm gonna give you ‐‐
‐Leslie! Leslie! Leslie!

00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:02,452
I'll give you $100,000 for 15%.

00:17:02,452 --> 00:17:03,753
‐Whoa!
‐$100,000 for 15%.

00:17:03,753 --> 00:17:06,322
I want to take this to ShurTech,
the people who make Duck Tape.

00:17:06,322 --> 00:17:07,524
I want to give you
some leverage.

00:17:07,524 --> 00:17:09,526
I want you to squeeze her down.
I'm gonna do this favor for you.

00:17:09,526 --> 00:17:11,494
I know the president of Staples
and the CEO.

00:17:11,494 --> 00:17:12,495
‐We all do.
‐We all do.

00:17:12,495 --> 00:17:13,596
‐But wait.
‐So what?

00:17:13,596 --> 00:17:15,398
Also, I think
this would work.

00:17:15,398 --> 00:17:18,268
Going back to Shutterfly,
who bought GrooveBook...

00:17:18,268 --> 00:17:18,902
Perfect add‐on,
don't you think?

00:17:18,902 --> 00:17:21,237
I did $38,000 a minute with them
two weeks ago on QVC.

00:17:21,237 --> 00:17:25,475
And every time he goes on,
the stock price goes down.
I also did cupcakes
at $38,000 a minute.

00:17:25,475 --> 00:17:27,410
So please stop
talking about it.

00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,411
I did $40,000 in ‐‐

00:17:28,411 --> 00:17:29,446
Kevin, is there
an offer coming?

00:17:29,446 --> 00:17:30,613
Yeah, are you
doing an offer?

00:17:30,613 --> 00:17:32,682
I want you to go with Lori
'cause I think you're great,

00:17:32,682 --> 00:17:36,686
but I'll do $100,000 for 10% so
you can drive her price down.

00:17:36,686 --> 00:17:38,588
Wow, you're giving her exactly
what she's asking for.

00:17:38,588 --> 00:17:40,490
Yes. I'll do it.
But you want her
to go with Lori?

00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,492
I'll do it for 10%, but I want
you to squeeze her head.

00:17:42,492 --> 00:17:43,526
Cuban: [ Laughs ]

00:17:43,526 --> 00:17:44,694
So, just to ‐‐

00:17:44,694 --> 00:17:47,597
Leslie, do you think that's
a nice partner to have ‐‐

00:17:47,597 --> 00:17:49,699
someone who wants to squeeze
a woman's head?

00:17:49,699 --> 00:17:52,235
I don't want to see you
taken advantage of.

00:17:52,235 --> 00:17:53,536
‐Wow!
‐Really, it's not.

00:17:53,536 --> 00:17:55,438
Okay, Leslie,
you got three offers.

00:17:55,438 --> 00:17:56,506
John:
Hold on one second.

00:17:56,506 --> 00:17:58,374
I absolutely know
that Lori

00:17:58,374 --> 00:18:00,610
is great for this deal,
of course, right?

00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,779
I didn't think about
that point with Shutterfly.

00:18:02,779 --> 00:18:05,815
And then me ‐‐ I want to sell or
license or work with ShurTech,

00:18:05,815 --> 00:18:08,451
the ones who do all
the Duck Tape in the world.

00:18:08,451 --> 00:18:10,887
So I think those are
our unique selling propositions.

00:18:10,887 --> 00:18:13,490
Lori, would you be interested
in teaming up

00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,492
with either Daymond
or Mr. Wonderful?

00:18:15,492 --> 00:18:16,860
Wow, Lori's not
enough for you?

00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,362
I don't really need to team up
with either of them.

00:18:19,362 --> 00:18:20,697
None of us need each other
on this one.

00:18:20,697 --> 00:18:21,965
The important thing,
Leslie,

00:18:21,965 --> 00:18:24,601
is that when my entrepreneurs
do a deal with me, they get me.

00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:26,503
I'm the one that's on the phone
with them.

00:18:26,503 --> 00:18:29,472
I'm the one that's doing
the designing of the packaging

00:18:29,472 --> 00:18:31,608
and helping them to get
everything done.

00:18:31,608 --> 00:18:33,576
Does she look like someone
who didn't do their homework,

00:18:33,576 --> 00:18:36,112
who doesn't see us
all with our entrepreneurs?

00:18:36,112 --> 00:18:36,746
She knows who does it.

00:18:36,746 --> 00:18:38,648
I'm just telling you
I'm not gonna ever speak ‐‐

00:18:38,648 --> 00:18:40,416
I have great respect
for my fellow Sharks.

00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:41,751
Leslie, do not give up 20%.
That's very foolish.

00:18:41,751 --> 00:18:43,620
But I do not ever speak
for what they do,

00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,888
as they shouldn't speak
for what I do.

00:18:44,888 --> 00:18:47,657
‐Right. Exactly.
‐I can only tell you what I do.

00:18:47,657 --> 00:18:49,526
Daymond will do it for 15%.
I'll do it for 10%.

00:18:49,526 --> 00:18:50,627
And I'm a good partner.

00:18:50,627 --> 00:18:52,662
‐So start squeezing.
‐Isn't that obnoxious?

00:18:52,662 --> 00:18:53,796
‐It is! It is!
‐Not at all.

00:18:53,796 --> 00:18:55,765
‐But I love him.
‐This is the Shark Tank, Leslie.

00:18:55,765 --> 00:18:58,234
‐Reject his offer.
‐This happens in the Shark Tank.

00:18:58,234 --> 00:18:58,768
Just because ‐‐

00:18:58,768 --> 00:19:00,637
All right, 20% is
a bit much equity for me.

00:19:00,637 --> 00:19:01,905
‐Way too much.
‐What's your counter?

00:19:01,905 --> 00:19:08,545
So my counter is would you be
open to $100,000 loan for 10%?

00:19:08,545 --> 00:19:13,316
If I don't repay you
in the first year, you get 20%.

00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:20,390
You got it.

00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,358
‐Done.
‐Done.

Making a deal with Kevin

our brand forward.

00:20:31,628 --> 00:20:34,464
but we got into
Bed Bath &amp; Beyond nationwide.

00:20:34,464 --> 00:20:35,632
It's only been
a few months,

00:20:35,632 --> 00:20:37,667
and we're already at over
$7 million in sales.

00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:40,169
IllumiBowl,
Mr. Wonderful is here!

00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:40,703
‐Yeah!
‐Hey, Kevin!

00:20:40,703 --> 00:20:42,538
O'Leary:
This company is exploding.

00:20:42,538 --> 00:20:44,407
They've got into
Bed Bath &amp; Beyond,

00:20:44,407 --> 00:20:46,342
and it's selling through
like hot cakes.

00:20:46,342 --> 00:20:48,344
If we're gonna make this
the number‐one way

00:20:48,344 --> 00:20:49,746
to light up a toilet bowl
in America,

00:20:49,746 --> 00:20:51,681
it has to be 10 times
bigger than this.

00:20:51,681 --> 00:20:53,449
You got to ramp up
production.

00:20:53,449 --> 00:20:55,518
You've got to blanket
the entire market.

00:20:55,518 --> 00:20:56,719
It's really important now

00:20:56,719 --> 00:20:59,589
that they get to the other big
boxes ‐‐ Walmart, Walgreens.

00:20:59,589 --> 00:21:01,591
They've got to get to every
single retailer,

00:21:01,591 --> 00:21:03,526
and I want my team
to help them get there.

00:21:03,526 --> 00:21:04,794
I love you guys.
‐[ Both laugh ]

00:21:04,794 --> 00:21:07,397
I think we're getting close.
[ Chuckles ]

00:21:07,397 --> 00:21:08,464
Oh, man.

00:21:08,464 --> 00:21:10,366
I've done a lot
of "Shark Tank" deals.

00:21:10,366 --> 00:21:12,468
It's really rare when a couple
of entrepreneurs

00:21:12,468 --> 00:21:14,570
like Mike and Matt
blow it up so big so fast.

00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,639
Next stop ‐‐
world domination toilets.

00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:18,741
We're gonna flush away
the competition.

00:21:18,741 --> 00:21:20,677
"Shark Tank" has really changed
our lives.

00:21:20,677 --> 00:21:22,879
We're lighting up toilets,
but we're also creating jobs,

00:21:22,879 --> 00:21:25,581
and we're inspiring people to do
more with their lives.

00:21:25,581 --> 00:21:26,849
With the growth
of IllumiBowl,

00:21:26,849 --> 00:21:29,519
our aim is to turn this into
a $50 million company.

00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:31,421
This is
our American dream.

I'm so glad to be here.

My name is Nick Massie.

I live in Truckee, California.

00:22:21,703 --> 00:22:24,940
I'm the Chief Culinary Ninja
at Ice Age Meals.

00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:30,378
And I'm seeking $1 million in
exchange for 10% of my company.

00:22:30,378 --> 00:22:31,513
$1 million?

00:22:31,513 --> 00:22:33,181
$1 million.

00:22:33,181 --> 00:22:33,882
Whoo!

00:22:33,882 --> 00:22:36,618
To debunk the myths you've been
fed about nutrition

00:22:36,618 --> 00:22:39,387
and show you the truth
about food is my mission.

00:22:39,387 --> 00:22:39,955
[ Chuckles ]

00:22:39,955 --> 00:22:42,557
To illustrate this,
I've written a poem.

00:22:42,557 --> 00:22:46,094
This is called
"The Ice Age is Here."

00:22:46,094 --> 00:22:49,731
It's the diet of the cavemen
who surely did eat it,

00:22:49,731 --> 00:22:53,635
and if you try it out,
you'll be tempted to cheat it.

00:22:53,635 --> 00:22:55,904
Thanks to the cardboard box,

00:22:55,904 --> 00:22:58,607
cooking skills
have been blunted.

00:22:58,607 --> 00:23:00,709
But cavemen didn't have
this problem, why?

00:23:00,709 --> 00:23:04,879
Because they gathered
and hunted.

00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:08,483
The obesity train is on a roll.

00:23:08,483 --> 00:23:09,751
The brakes are broken.

00:23:09,751 --> 00:23:10,952
It's out of control.

00:23:10,952 --> 00:23:13,922
Time is now more valuable
than ever.

00:23:13,922 --> 00:23:18,727
We've got planning and shopping
and cooking and dishes.

00:23:18,727 --> 00:23:22,864
It's like we need a genie to
come grant our meal‐prep wishes.

00:23:22,864 --> 00:23:26,835
Now, I don't have a shiny lamp.

00:23:26,835 --> 00:23:30,905
What I've got is a simple
cardboard box with ice

00:23:30,905 --> 00:23:35,644

How many calories
is in this?

00:24:20,889 --> 00:24:23,825
All of our meals
are around 500 calories.

00:24:23,825 --> 00:24:26,594
‐So this one plate is 500?
‐This one meal is 500?

No, that's about 1/3 portion

What is the Paleo diet?

The Paleo diet is meat
and vegetables, nuts and seeds,

some fruit, little starch,
and no sugar.

What does it cost you
to make this?

selling the product?

How many meals?

So, if you want to buy
12 meals,

you pay $120
plus $20 shipping.

00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,879
Okay, so, $140.

00:25:17,879 --> 00:25:18,880

I ultimately got a job
at Aspen, Colorado,

00:26:21,776 --> 00:26:25,613
So is this why you're valuing
the business where you're at?

00:26:25,613 --> 00:26:27,148
Correct.
Because based on
this future business

that you think
you're gonna have?
Do you actually have a written
agreement with CrossFit

00:26:30,018 --> 00:26:31,853
that gives you the right
to market under their name?

00:26:31,853 --> 00:26:33,655
I don't have a written
agreement.

'cause it's very preliminary.
‐Right.

Talk to me a little bit
about the story, in your mind,

00:26:53,775 --> 00:26:57,679
of how you got to this value
of $10 million.

They're gonna believe in me.

00:28:20,461 --> 00:28:22,230
‐Nick ‐‐
‐That's the answer?

00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,431
Yeah.

00:28:23,431 --> 00:28:24,632
‐I'm out.
‐Okay.

00:28:24,632 --> 00:28:26,668
Nick, I love the story.
I love the name.

‐How is this still gonna happen?
‐I love everything.

00:28:28,636 --> 00:28:30,705
‐We're getting there.
‐I love the questions.

00:28:30,705 --> 00:28:31,906
I hate the valuation.

‐You don't say, Robert?
‐I know you do.

00:28:33,741 --> 00:28:35,043
‐You've got a problem.
‐But you love me.

00:28:35,043 --> 00:28:37,111
Robert, you love me, don't you?
I find $10 million
a little rich.

00:28:37,111 --> 00:28:39,414
‐How about $1 million's rich?
‐I do love you, Nick!

00:28:39,414 --> 00:28:40,448
Yes! Whoo!

one of these freezers.

A guy shows up.

‐Can I just tell you?
‐Yeah.

00:28:49,757 --> 00:28:52,827
If I was ever in a meeting
and we were talking business

and you came back to me
and said, "Huh?!"

00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,465
it would be over
right there.

‐There's the, "Huh?!"

Just because I tell
the truth.

I'm the only Shark

So, Nick, I love the story.

00:29:14,649 --> 00:29:17,385
I love the name.
Hate the value.

00:29:17,385 --> 00:29:18,519
It's insane.

Ohh!

to say this with tact.

you going to do?
Lori.

You know you came in here ‐‐

00:29:47,882 --> 00:29:49,817
You asked for a huge amount
of money.

00:29:49,817 --> 00:29:51,052
I know.
I understand that.

00:29:51,052 --> 00:29:53,721
Without having that paper
in your hand that said,

00:29:53,721 --> 00:29:55,023
"I have
this $5 million deal."

00:29:55,023 --> 00:29:57,558
‐Even that. Too much.
‐That's the problem.

00:29:57,558 --> 00:29:59,460
It was just too high.
‐I understand.

I'm out.

00:30:03,431 --> 00:30:04,699
‐Okay, guys.
‐Congratulations.

‐Thank you so much.
‐Congratulations.

‐Yeah, thank you. Thank you.
‐Good luck.

‐Yeah.
‐Huh?! Huh?!

But it's just the way
the guy is.

Come on, we're not all polished
and slick like you.

00:30:17,712 --> 00:30:19,781
I'm certainly not polished.
Maybe slick,

00:30:19,781 --> 00:30:22,517
but it's like rubbing your
fingers on a chalkboard.

00:30:22,517 --> 00:30:24,419
It would have
driven me nuts.

00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:31,926
I'm Jeff.

00:30:31,926 --> 00:30:33,995
And this is
my 17‐year‐old son, Jack.

00:30:33,995 --> 00:30:36,564
And we're from Mandeville,
Louisiana.

00:30:36,564 --> 00:30:38,566
Jack and I have been
fishing together

00:30:38,566 --> 00:30:39,767
since he was one year old.

00:30:39,767 --> 00:30:41,969
I could cast a fishing pole
before I could even walk,

00:30:41,969 --> 00:30:44,605
but that certainly doesn't
mean that we're experts.

00:30:44,605 --> 00:30:45,807
Oops.
[ Chuckles ]

00:30:45,807 --> 00:30:49,010
We've had too many trips where
we came home empty‐handed.

00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:51,712
There had to be a way that
we could catch more fish.

00:30:51,712 --> 00:30:54,582
So we invented it.

00:30:54,582 --> 00:30:56,918
Jack has always been
an exceptionally bright kid.

00:30:56,918 --> 00:31:00,788
And he is really the driving
force behind this business.

00:31:00,788 --> 00:31:04,692
Instead of going out with
friends, I stay at home working.

00:31:04,692 --> 00:31:07,662
I built the website, the
prototyping, the engineering.

00:31:07,662 --> 00:31:08,896
Ohh!

00:31:08,896 --> 00:31:11,866
We know that we need to get into
the big retail fishing stores.

‐That was a huge gar fish.
‐Ohh!

We can't get them
to take our calls.

‐Wow!
‐Whoo!

00:31:16,537 --> 00:31:19,540

this business started.

Bye‐bye, big guy.

00:31:43,664 --> 00:31:45,733
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Jack Danos.

00:31:45,733 --> 00:31:47,602
And my name
is Jeff Danos.

00:31:47,602 --> 00:31:51,672
We're a father‐son team from
Mandeville, Louisiana.

00:31:51,672 --> 00:31:56,444
We're seeking $150,000 in return
for 10% of our company.

00:31:57,778 --> 00:32:01,549
We're the inventors
of the TactiBite Fish Call.

00:32:01,549 --> 00:32:03,551
"What's a Fish Call,"
you ask?

00:32:03,551 --> 00:32:06,187
Well, it's like a duck call,
but for fish.

00:32:06,187 --> 00:32:06,954
You see, the two of us

00:32:06,954 --> 00:32:09,690
have been on countless
fishing trips together,

00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:12,660
and even though my dad claimed
to be an expert fisherman,

00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:16,430
the truth is on plenty of trips,
we really didn't do so well.

00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,031
Now, come on, Jack.

00:32:17,031 --> 00:32:20,902
You know that I've always been
the fish master.

00:32:20,902 --> 00:32:23,004
[ Chuckling ]
Whatever you say, Dad.

00:32:23,004 --> 00:32:25,973
So, anyways, we came up
with a way to help my dad

and all of the other
"fish masters" out there

00:32:29,343 --> 00:32:30,811
catch more fish.

00:32:30,811 --> 00:32:33,714
The TactiBite Fish Call
works by sending out

00:32:33,714 --> 00:32:36,984
sounds and vibrations that
attract predator and game fish.

00:32:36,984 --> 00:32:41,722
You simply turn it on, toss it
out, and cast around it.

00:32:41,722 --> 00:32:43,624
This is what
the fish hear.

[ High‐pitched rattling ]

00:32:47,895 --> 00:32:50,598

but head towards it

in search
of their next meal.

00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,636
It's affordable, compact,
and, yes, it really works.

00:32:55,636 --> 00:32:58,906
We already know that this thing
works on fish.

00:32:58,906 --> 00:33:02,777
Now we want to see if it will
attract the Sharks.

00:33:02,777 --> 00:33:04,745
So, tell us about your business.
How much have you sold?

00:33:04,745 --> 00:33:05,980
‐Can we see the product?
‐Wait, can we see it?

00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:09,684
So, essentially,
that sound that we heard...

00:33:09,684 --> 00:33:11,719
‐Yes.
‐... that attracts the fish?

00:33:11,719 --> 00:33:14,455
Yes.
It makes them think
other fish are feeding.

00:33:14,455 --> 00:33:15,423
That's correct.

00:33:15,423 --> 00:33:16,824
[ High‐pitched rattling ]

00:33:16,824 --> 00:33:18,759
And that is our
"scared shrimp" sound.

Scared shrimp?

00:33:19,794 --> 00:33:21,462

Both: Exactly.

00:33:21,462 --> 00:33:22,663
Do shrimp
really make sound?

00:33:22,663 --> 00:33:23,931
Yeah, so, it will.
[ Low‐pitched rattling ]

00:33:23,931 --> 00:33:25,833
Oh, it makes multiple
different sounds.

00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:27,835
Depending on the fish
that you are going after.

00:33:27,835 --> 00:33:30,738
Automated voice: <i>Sound number</i>
one ‐‐ <i>scared shrimp.</i>

00:33:30,738 --> 00:33:33,407
"Sound number one ‐‐
scared shrimp."

What is sound number two?

00:33:34,675 --> 00:33:36,577
So, that's called
"rattle battle,"

00:33:36,577 --> 00:33:38,613
and you can hit ‐‐
That's it right there.

00:33:38,613 --> 00:33:41,015
So, we found that freshwater
fish really like that sound.

00:33:41,015 --> 00:33:44,619
So, how many more fish
do you find you catch

00:33:44,619 --> 00:33:45,920
by throwing this
into the water

00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,656
versus when you went out
on a normal fishing day?

00:33:48,656 --> 00:33:50,758
We used to be the guys
who would go out,

00:33:50,758 --> 00:33:51,993
and whenever we'd come back,

00:33:51,993 --> 00:33:54,862
we'd talk to other people about
how many they caught.

00:33:54,862 --> 00:33:57,565
And we'd always catch
less than other people.

00:33:57,565 --> 00:33:58,866
So now,
when we go back in,

00:33:58,866 --> 00:34:02,003
we almost always have caught
more fish than the other people.

00:34:02,003 --> 00:34:04,405
Can I just get
a technical description

00:34:04,405 --> 00:34:05,539
of exactly how I use it?

00:34:05,539 --> 00:34:06,807
This is the anchor.

00:34:06,807 --> 00:34:10,044
So, when you toss it out,
this sinks down...
Yeah.

00:34:10,044 --> 00:34:14,448
... and this stays on the top,
so it holds it in place.

00:34:14,448 --> 00:34:16,584
Have you sold any?

00:34:16,584 --> 00:34:17,952

So, Jack, every Shark up here
is an expert at something.

There's one Shark up here that
is an absolute expert fisherman.

00:34:54,522 --> 00:34:55,623
Who do you think that is?

00:34:55,623 --> 00:34:56,691
I think it's Daymond.

00:34:56,691 --> 00:34:57,958
We would bet
it's Daymond.

00:34:57,958 --> 00:35:00,494
You are the fish master.
Will this work?

00:35:00,494 --> 00:35:01,629
How would I know
if it would work?

00:35:01,629 --> 00:35:02,797
Well, what do you think?
You're a fisherman.

00:35:02,797 --> 00:35:04,598
‐He never used it before.
‐The noise ‐‐ Would it work?

00:35:04,598 --> 00:35:05,733
Have you ever used
a fishing lure

00:35:05,733 --> 00:35:06,867
that has a rattler
that makes sound?

00:35:06,867 --> 00:35:08,602
Yeah, I use poppers,
rattles, all of them.

00:35:08,602 --> 00:35:09,603
‐Exactly.
‐Exactly.

00:35:09,603 --> 00:35:11,472
All right, so,
let's say a popper.

00:35:11,472 --> 00:35:12,606
It's going into the water.

00:35:12,606 --> 00:35:14,775
This is not going to
give a motion

00:35:14,775 --> 00:35:16,777
to make the fish
jerk and react.

00:35:16,777 --> 00:35:19,814
So, it doesn't make, like,
a splashing in the water,

00:35:19,814 --> 00:35:21,048
but it does
simulate that.

00:35:21,048 --> 00:35:24,585
Fish have what's called lateral
lines that run down both sides,

00:35:24,585 --> 00:35:25,953
and it's basically
like our ears.

00:35:25,953 --> 00:35:27,922
They have little hairs
that feel sounds

00:35:27,922 --> 00:35:29,657
and vibrations
in the water.

00:35:29,657 --> 00:35:30,958
And so they feel
something.

00:35:30,958 --> 00:35:33,661
They feel like it feels
like a school of fish

00:35:33,661 --> 00:35:35,629
or, you know,
prey that's injured,

00:35:35,629 --> 00:35:37,765
and they head towards it.

00:35:37,765 --> 00:35:39,667
How much inventory
do you have?

00:35:39,667 --> 00:35:40,968
‐We just ‐‐
‐$500,000 worth.

00:35:40,968 --> 00:35:43,404
Wow! Where'd you get
the money for that?

00:35:43,404 --> 00:35:43,904
‐Wow.
‐Daddy.

00:35:43,904 --> 00:35:45,740
That was actually all
paid for by ‐‐

00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,575
So, our first order
was 3,000 units.

00:35:47,575 --> 00:35:48,776
So, yeah, 'cause your costs
are so low,

00:35:48,776 --> 00:35:49,944
you were able to buy them
for $85,000.

00:35:49,944 --> 00:35:51,846
We sold those,
and we bought the next 6,000

00:35:51,846 --> 00:35:52,980
just on the money
we had in the bank.

00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,648
So you paid
for all that inventory.

00:35:54,648 --> 00:35:55,783
‐Yes.
‐We own it.

00:35:55,783 --> 00:35:58,386
So, with that inventory,
why don't you back yourself?

00:35:58,386 --> 00:35:59,053
You have the money.

00:35:59,053 --> 00:36:01,589
The reason that we wanted to
bring a Shark onboard

00:36:01,589 --> 00:36:02,823
is because we know
what you can do.

00:36:02,823 --> 00:36:04,792
We know that you can get us
into retail stores,

00:36:04,792 --> 00:36:06,961
and we know that you can
just make it explode.

00:36:06,961 --> 00:36:09,697
O'Leary: Okay, a little nervous
about the $99.

00:36:09,697 --> 00:36:11,699
I'm thinking more
$69, $79 for them.

00:36:11,699 --> 00:36:13,601
But, you know,
10%'s not enough

00:36:13,601 --> 00:36:15,603
to get me out of the water,
I think.

00:36:15,603 --> 00:36:16,704
It's too light.

00:36:16,704 --> 00:36:19,774
So I'm gonna say I'll do
$150,000 for 20%.

00:36:19,774 --> 00:36:21,041
Before we go cutting
our valuation,

00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:23,744
I'd just like to explain how we
got there with the valuation.

00:36:23,744 --> 00:36:25,079
‐Sure. Fire away.
‐That's fair. Go ahead.

00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:29,650
So, so far this year, we've done
$330,000 in five months.

00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,619
So this year, we will do ‐‐

00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:34,855
If we just stay on track,
we'll do over $750,000.

00:36:34,855 --> 00:36:37,691
On that, we'll net
at least $300,000.

00:36:37,691 --> 00:36:40,594
And so what we did is we took
a 5x multiple on that,

00:36:40,594 --> 00:36:42,496
and that got us
to $1.5 million.

00:36:42,496 --> 00:36:43,631
That's a good call.

00:36:43,631 --> 00:36:45,599
Jack, you are the freakiest,
smartest 17‐year‐old

00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:46,567
in the world.

00:36:46,567 --> 00:36:47,635
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:36:47,635 --> 00:36:49,570
Okay, guys, let me tell you
something, Jack.

00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:51,639
The way I look at it is,
99 bucks may not play,

00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:54,475
and they may not put and give it
shelf space on that basis.

00:36:54,475 --> 00:36:55,476
I don't know that yet.

00:36:55,476 --> 00:36:56,777
We're all gonna learn that
together.

00:36:56,777 --> 00:36:59,547
Other Sharks may give you
a better valuation,

00:36:59,547 --> 00:37:01,649
but for me,
it feels right at 20%.

00:37:01,649 --> 00:37:02,883
‐Your valuation's fair.
‐Okay.

00:37:02,883 --> 00:37:04,852
John: I think your valuation
is fair, as well.

00:37:04,852 --> 00:37:06,821
Reading
in between the lines is,

00:37:06,821 --> 00:37:09,590
there's gonna be expected work
on our side,

00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:11,692
besides capital,
and that's time.

00:37:11,692 --> 00:37:13,761
So I'm gonna match
Kevin O'Leary's offer,

00:37:13,761 --> 00:37:16,697
and I just want you to choose me
over him at the equal value

00:37:16,697 --> 00:37:18,499
so we can screw him
together.

00:37:18,499 --> 00:37:19,500
[ Chuckles ]

00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,634
All right, guys, look,

00:37:20,634 --> 00:37:22,736
I just want to show you
something very important.

00:37:22,736 --> 00:37:25,439
Just as you think.
I don't often bring this out.

00:37:25,439 --> 00:37:26,674
This is very important.

00:37:26,674 --> 00:37:27,908
He's gonna make your money
disappear.

00:37:27,908 --> 00:37:29,610
Mr. Wonderful
is open for business.

00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:30,644
‐[ Laughs ]
‐Ooh!

00:37:30,644 --> 00:37:31,812
‐We love that.
‐Exactly.

00:37:31,812 --> 00:37:34,982
And that's very special.
Very special.

00:37:34,982 --> 00:37:37,918
Okay, so, guys, since you have
all these hard‐core fishermen,

00:37:37,918 --> 00:37:40,721
and the only thing that I fish
for is money and deals,

00:37:40,721 --> 00:37:43,657
this isn't something for me.
So I'm out.

00:37:43,657 --> 00:37:45,893
‐Okay. Thank you for your time.
‐Thank you.

00:37:45,893 --> 00:37:48,929
I know fishermen will do
anything to catch fish.

00:37:48,929 --> 00:37:50,631
‐We all want to catch fish.
‐And it's a passion.

00:37:50,631 --> 00:37:52,466
I don't think I've seen
any sport

00:37:52,466 --> 00:37:53,701
as passionate
as fishermen.

00:37:53,701 --> 00:37:56,837
I like this because
some of the most popular

00:37:56,837 --> 00:37:59,073
infomercial products
were fishing products.

00:37:59,073 --> 00:38:02,443
Really?
That's the world
that I'm really in.

00:38:02,443 --> 00:38:03,811
‐Okay.
‐I love TV sales.

00:38:03,811 --> 00:38:06,580
I love the infomercial world.
I have great partners.

00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:09,583
I see this as being able
to blow it up

00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:11,986
by doing a great infomercial
with it

00:38:11,986 --> 00:38:15,055
so that people can see
how it works.
Yes.

00:38:15,055 --> 00:38:17,658
Lori, are you in an interview,
or are you making an offer?

00:38:17,658 --> 00:38:18,893
‐I'm making an offer.
‐Before we die.

00:38:18,893 --> 00:38:23,664
Okay, I'll give you
$150,000 for 15%.

00:38:23,664 --> 00:38:25,332
Thank you for your offer.

00:38:25,332 --> 00:38:25,866
Better offer.

00:38:25,866 --> 00:38:27,668
Can I just ‐‐
Can I ask why you ‐‐

00:38:27,668 --> 00:38:30,404
Like, what ‐‐ Do you feel like
our valuation is too high?

00:38:30,404 --> 00:38:31,071
Like, what ‐‐

00:38:31,071 --> 00:38:34,642
I think everybody agreed that
we were at a fair valuation.

00:38:34,642 --> 00:38:35,743
You know what you guys are
running into,

00:38:35,743 --> 00:38:36,877
and it's very simple ‐‐

00:38:36,877 --> 00:38:39,613
When you actually get a Shark
as an investor,

00:38:39,613 --> 00:38:40,781
that's extremely valuable.

00:38:40,781 --> 00:38:42,683
We've learned that
over the years,

00:38:42,683 --> 00:38:44,552
and I don't do that
for free.

00:38:44,552 --> 00:38:46,520
That's why I have
this plaque.

00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,223
‐That plaque.
‐It's expensive.

00:38:51,926 --> 00:38:52,984
What I would like
to counter ‐‐

00:38:52,984 --> 00:38:56,497
Lori, would you do $200,000
for the 15%?

00:39:07,775 --> 00:39:09,043
Narrator:
One Shark is out.

00:39:09,043 --> 00:39:11,812
Jack and Jeffrey have
three offers on the table

00:39:11,812 --> 00:39:14,014
for their fish baiter
TactiBite Fish Call.

00:39:14,014 --> 00:39:16,817
And they've made a counteroffer
to Lori.

00:39:16,817 --> 00:39:20,421
Would you do $200,000
for the 15%?

00:39:22,489 --> 00:39:23,857
No.

00:39:23,857 --> 00:39:28,729
I know with my Simply Fit Board
infomercial we just did, right,

00:39:28,729 --> 00:39:33,000
I probably put personally
150 hours into it

00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,936
from editing it, producing it,
the script, everything.

00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,671
I don't think your brand
is fishing, Lori.

00:39:37,671 --> 00:39:39,306
I got to tell you.
‐It was really ‐‐

00:39:39,306 --> 00:39:40,541
My brand is product.

00:39:40,541 --> 00:39:42,876
I don't care
if it's fishing or a tutu.

00:39:42,876 --> 00:39:44,912
It doesn't matter to me.
You're that good
at everything, Lori?

00:39:44,912 --> 00:39:47,414
O'Leary: I just don't
think your brand is fish.

00:39:47,414 --> 00:39:48,449
How chauvinistic
are you?

00:39:48,449 --> 00:39:49,416
‐Very.
‐Thank you, Daymond.

00:39:49,416 --> 00:39:50,050
Here's my thing
about Lori.

00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,785
I think she's great
at what she does, right?

00:39:51,785 --> 00:39:53,487
‐Has everybody made an offer?
‐Not yet.

00:39:53,487 --> 00:39:54,688
‐We haven't ‐‐
‐Oh, Robert.

00:39:54,688 --> 00:39:55,789
We're not sure
if we've ‐‐

00:39:55,789 --> 00:39:56,890
We'd like to hear
if you have an offer.

00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:59,693
You've thrown some chum
into the water.

00:39:59,693 --> 00:40:00,995
We have.
They're hearing ‐‐

00:40:00,995 --> 00:40:03,530
The Sharks are hearing the call,
I believe.

00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:04,832
Absolutely.

00:40:04,832 --> 00:40:06,734
You know, I find it
very interesting

00:40:06,734 --> 00:40:08,902
that every Shark told you
your valuation is fair.

00:40:08,902 --> 00:40:11,005
How often do we ask that
question on the show?

00:40:11,005 --> 00:40:14,808
How rarely does somebody give us
a good answer for that?

00:40:14,808 --> 00:40:17,845
I love the story.
I love your sales.

00:40:17,845 --> 00:40:20,614
I like the offer you made.
‐Okay.

00:40:20,614 --> 00:40:21,882
I'll give you
the $150,000,

00:40:21,882 --> 00:40:24,318
and I'll give it to you
for the 10%.

00:40:25,653 --> 00:40:26,787
I'll give it to you
for the 10%.

00:40:26,787 --> 00:40:28,722
‐Ohh!
‐I won't give it to you for 10%.

00:40:28,722 --> 00:40:30,891
Because I don't like him
doing that.
Doing what?

00:40:30,891 --> 00:40:33,694
I will ‐‐ Because you're sitting
there lecturing them.
Doing what?

00:40:33,694 --> 00:40:36,697
John: Guys, let me say, I'm not
gonna counter against Robert.

00:40:36,697 --> 00:40:37,931
I'm gonna stay
where I'm at.

00:40:37,931 --> 00:40:40,000
I want to ask you
a question.

00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,537
How many times do you think
each one of these Sharks

00:40:43,537 --> 00:40:44,805
go fishing a month?

00:40:44,805 --> 00:40:47,908
‐I would be lying if I guessed.
‐Greiner: Admittedly, I do not.

00:40:47,908 --> 00:40:49,743
I go fishing a month
about six times.

00:40:49,743 --> 00:40:50,844
‐Do you?
‐He does.

00:40:50,844 --> 00:40:52,680
‐Yeah, he really does fish.
‐So I live this.

00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,647
See, while he's fishing,

00:40:53,647 --> 00:40:54,748
I'm working at making
our guys money.

00:40:54,748 --> 00:40:55,916
But that's a whole
different thing.

00:40:55,916 --> 00:40:57,751
Yeah, when I'm fishing,
my money's making me money.

00:40:57,751 --> 00:40:58,986
‐[ Laughs ]
‐I'm gonna tell you this.

00:40:58,986 --> 00:41:00,854
So I'm letting you know
that's where I stand,

00:41:00,854 --> 00:41:02,056
and I'm gonna allow them
to fight.

00:41:02,056 --> 00:41:04,625
Mine is $150,000 for 10%.
But I'd like you to answer now.

00:41:04,625 --> 00:41:06,560
So, I'm not gonna wait
for Robert.

00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,796
Just one question ‐‐
Would you be interested

00:41:08,796 --> 00:41:11,765
in partnering with Robert
for the same $150,000 for 10%?

00:41:11,765 --> 00:41:13,667
No, because
I don't need Robert.

00:41:13,667 --> 00:41:15,269
I know I'm the one that's gonna
be doing all of the work.

00:41:15,269 --> 00:41:18,605
She didn't offer you
the right amount of
money at the beginning.

00:41:18,605 --> 00:41:19,773
He doesn't know how to do
an infomercial.

00:41:19,773 --> 00:41:20,841
She's reacting,
as she always does,

00:41:20,841 --> 00:41:21,875
to what's happening
in the water.

00:41:21,875 --> 00:41:22,943
We all know how to do
infomercials.

00:41:22,943 --> 00:41:24,278
Robert did this
the other day.

00:41:24,278 --> 00:41:24,912
I'm not fighting
for Robert,

00:41:24,912 --> 00:41:26,547
but we all know how
to do infomercials.

00:41:26,547 --> 00:41:27,581
I'm not
gonna deal with it.

00:41:27,581 --> 00:41:28,782
‐It's ridiculous.
‐I believe in you.

00:41:28,782 --> 00:41:31,251
I think you're great.
I'd like you to take my offer.

00:41:31,251 --> 00:41:31,985
And I respect if you don't.

00:41:31,985 --> 00:41:33,654
When I'm buying
a tractor‐supply company,

00:41:33,654 --> 00:41:35,322
she's gonna be selling
earrings.

00:41:36,123 --> 00:41:39,426
I respect Lori. You don't need
two Sharks on this.

00:41:39,426 --> 00:41:41,361
Look, I gave you
what you wanted.

00:41:41,361 --> 00:41:44,031
$150,000 for 10%.

00:41:49,503 --> 00:41:50,771
Robert, we would love
to accept your offer.

00:41:50,771 --> 00:41:51,872
‐Bang.
‐Let's go fishing!

00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,807
‐Let's go fishing!
‐Whoo! Let's go! Come on!

00:41:53,807 --> 00:41:55,542
‐Let's go!
‐I'll go fishing now!

00:41:55,542 --> 00:41:56,677
Yeah!

00:41:56,677 --> 00:41:57,811
Oh, my God.

00:41:57,811 --> 00:42:00,581
Thank you.
‐Thank you, guys.

00:42:00,581 --> 00:42:02,382
‐Good luck.
‐Thank you.

00:42:02,382 --> 00:42:03,584
‐Whoo!
‐Come on.

00:42:03,584 --> 00:42:05,753
All right!
That was awesome.

00:42:05,753 --> 00:42:07,554
That was awesome.
We did it.

00:42:07,554 --> 00:42:10,924
To see those guys stand up there
and say that,

00:42:10,924 --> 00:42:15,529
"Jack, you've got to be
the smartest 17‐year‐old kid

00:42:15,529 --> 00:42:17,397
that I've ever met" ‐‐

00:42:17,397 --> 00:42:18,699
There's just nothing
like it.

00:42:18,699 --> 00:42:21,502
Well, I guess
I'm taking this back.

00:42:21,502 --> 00:42:22,736
[ Laughter ]

00:42:22,736 --> 00:42:25,372
I'm gonna put it back
and bring it out later.
