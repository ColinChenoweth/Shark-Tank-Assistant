popular garden sizes
that people already have.

00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,616
Okay.
So,
your 4‐foot by 8‐foot

00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,884
is your typical container
for an average‐sized bed.

00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:06,652
So, if I had a garden
like that in my backyard,

00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:07,753
I'd buy this.
You'd buy that.

00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:09,522
Exactly.
So, I ‐‐ I buy it.

00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:10,856
I just put it down...

00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:12,491
Yeah,
and then you water it.

00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:13,759
You secure the corner
with the stakes

00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,695
that are included
inside of that as well, um,

00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:18,531
just to make sure the wind
doesn't blow it away.

00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,566
And then,
do I put more dirt on it?

00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,201
You do not need to put
any dirt on top of it.

00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:22,802
You don't?
You do not.

00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,604
So, this is
a weed‐blocking fabric.

00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:25,805
It allows air flow
through it.

00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,573
It allows moisture
to flow through.

00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:28,808
Cameron,
what's your background?

00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,743
My background
was in architecture

00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,678
and environmental
studies.

00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,513
Okay.
And so, the origin
for the Seedsheet

00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:35,514
actually came one summer

00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,483
when I was house‐sitting
for a co‐worker.

00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,684
And because it was Vermont,

00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:39,785
this "house" was actually

00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:41,621
a fully‐functioning
80‐acre dairy farm...

00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,956
Wow...
and I was paid with
access to their garden,

00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:46,726
looking at this garden
that was magnificent, perfect,

00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:49,595
and every plant
was the correct spacing apart.

00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:52,431
And so, I wondered,
how can you approach agriculture

00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:53,599
from an architect's
perspective?

00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,468
And, so,
how much does it cost?

00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:56,802
So our smallest‐sized
kits ‐‐

00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,804
these are these
container‐sized kits, right?

00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:01,607
so that's retailing
for $14.99,

00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:02,875
wholesale for $7.50,

00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,678
and that's costing us
between $1 to $3 to make.

00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,647
And how ‐‐
what are your sales?

00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:11,484
So, our sales to date
are 156 grand,

00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:12,785
and that is...

00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:15,287
That's this year,
or just from the beginning?
Total.

00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:16,022
So, we are 20 months old.

00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:19,492
We've only been in business
for one gardening season.

00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:20,493
So, you're really trying

00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:21,661
to simplify the process
for somebody.

00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:23,663
I can obviously
just buy the packs of seeds,

00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:25,564
which I'm gonna guess
are a lot cheaper.

00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:26,599
If you were to buy

00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,401
eight different
varieties of seeds,

00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:29,635
that'd be eight seed packets.

00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,871
Each seed packet
for a high‐quality, organic,

00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,839
non‐GMO seed like ours
is $3 to $4.

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,908
So already,
you're saving money.

00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:38,644
We are specifically
targeting new gardeners,

00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:41,547
and so that fastest‐growing
gardening demographic

00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,648
is Millennials.

00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:43,649
How do you reach them?

00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,384
Going through retail
is going to be tough,

00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:45,951
don't you think?
Sure.

00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:47,853
So we've started ‐‐
um, this past spring

00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:49,922
was the first spring
that we've been in business.

00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,658
And we launched
in 46 Home Depot stores.

00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:53,693
Right, but retail ‐‐

00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:54,860
you've got to deal
with inventory,

00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,495
inventory planning,
you know,

00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,798
and then marketing
and mark‐downs and returns

00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:00,900
and all that stuff,
right?
Yeah.

00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,868
Online,
you could build to order.
Yeah.

00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,537
John: All right,
so here's what I think.

00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:05,705
I was sitting here in awe,

00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:07,606
I mean, that this is
a disruption,

00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,642
this is just incredible,
so...

00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:11,410
Disruption?
Yeah.

00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,712
I think it's a disruption
in the space.

00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:13,946
I think that ‐‐
or, it's just creating

00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:17,349
a new space of home gardening,
making it easy.

00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:18,617
But I think
I have to agree with

00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:20,720
what some of the other Sharks
have said.

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,456
You're saying that you're
targeting Millennials,

00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,524
but yet, the first step
is in retail.

00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:27,560
And you haven't
figured that part out.

00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,862
I think you have a lot
of challenges at this moment

00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:32,298
that's gonna cost
a lot more money,

00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:33,699
so I'm out.

00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,468
Thank you very much.

00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:37,536
You know, I ‐‐
I struggle with the idea.

00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,438
You know,
I'm looking at my son.

00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,906
Is he gonna order
a kit like this?

00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:43,709
Absolutely, 'cause you know,
Millennials love it ‐‐

00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,878
back‐to‐the‐farm
kind of thing.
Mm‐hmm.

00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:48,547
But is he, then,
gonna go to a garden store

00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:51,217
and get some dirt
and actually put it down?

00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:52,685
Um, no.

00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,154
I just ‐‐
I don't know if I see it.

00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,455
I'm out.

00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,724
Thank you very much,
Robert.

00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:00,526
I freakin' love this.

00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:01,894
All right!

00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:04,697
I love it
for a lot of reasons.

00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,699
I'm an urban girl,

00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,467
so I never
got to grow things ‐‐

00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,802
didn't grow up
around any of that.

00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,571
But when I first
found out about all of it,

00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:15,307
I wanted to be
a hydroponic farmer one day.

00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:15,908
[ Laughter ]

00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,510
Literally, no joke.
Mackugler: [ Laughs ]

00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,445
That's awesome.

00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:22,648
And QVC is
highly‐demonstrable products.

00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:26,685
And they have a huge
gardening time of year,

00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:29,622
so I think
that I could help you

00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:31,757
to get publicity out there,

00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,359
get people to know
what it is,

00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,661
get some good sales fast.

00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,464

00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,502

So, I'm gonna offer you
$500,000 for 22%.

Thank you very much
for that offer.

00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:53,646
I'll do it for 15%.

that's what I'm saying.

...then, I think we should
get a higher percentage,

even bigger.

a higher valuation,

You never said,

00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,839
I'm a really good salesman.
That's the bottom line.

you could the deal

00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:00,646

Well, hang on a sec.
But you never said

whether or not
you would come in on that.

00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:03,883
At 22%, that'd be
the lowest I could go.

00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:05,951
That'd be the lowest
you could go.
Yeah. I like it,

a slam‐dunk by a long shot.

that's why I think with Lori,

00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,658
we get the sales
quickly with QVC.

My first teaching job

00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,981
was as an English teacher
in Japan.

00:26:56,981 --> 00:26:58,916
And after that,
Loyola Marymount found me

00:26:58,916 --> 00:27:00,785

into their department

To be an entrepreneur.

00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,598
Let's get back to
the business for a moment,

00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:14,899
because I was actually
involved in a deal

00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:17,535
that made bamboo knives
and forks.

00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:18,736
What I found out is,

00:27:18,736 --> 00:27:23,407
the restaurant will not pay
1/8 of 1 cent more

00:27:23,407 --> 00:27:24,008
for a bamboo spoon.

00:27:24,008 --> 00:27:26,611
They couldn't couldn't give
a flying "beep"!

00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:28,646
So, if you're
a restaurant chain,

00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:30,915
generally you buy these
from a distributor.

00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:33,684
You care about every cent
in what you pay.

00:27:33,684 --> 00:27:35,786
What do yours cost
versus those?

00:27:35,786 --> 00:27:37,889
Two ‐‐ um, we sell it
for 10 cents.

00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:40,791
We sell it to distributors
for 6 cents.

Good for you.

00:27:41,959 --> 00:27:43,694
Herjavec: And what does
a restaurant today

00:27:43,694 --> 00:27:45,630
pay for them?
It depends.

00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,798
So, middle‐tier,
like your P. F. Chang's,

00:27:47,798 --> 00:27:49,734
pays about
3 cents to 8 cents.

00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:52,670
Then your high‐tier market,
like your Nobu,

00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:56,007
pays anywhere from 8 cents
to as much as 17 cents.

00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,709
You will not be able to charge
a cent more for this.

00:27:58,709 --> 00:27:59,977
Nobody will care.

00:27:59,977 --> 00:28:02,179

for the same price ‐‐
That's our ‐‐

I think you're killing it.

You have the same problem
I had when I was your size ‐‐

is you want to do everything
'cause you can.

But you got to let some
of this knock‐off stuff go,

00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,735
and you just got to be
more efficient,

00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:05,802
and you're gonna get there.
