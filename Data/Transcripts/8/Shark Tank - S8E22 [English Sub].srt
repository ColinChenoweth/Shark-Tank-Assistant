00:12:52,737 --> 00:12:54,372
‐Wow!
‐Can you see that?

00:12:54,372 --> 00:12:55,473
John:
That's with that.

00:12:55,473 --> 00:12:56,941
Yonover:
This is the See Rescue streamer.

00:12:56,941 --> 00:13:00,211
And that's as long as the one
that Kevin just rolled out.

00:13:00,211 --> 00:13:01,346
That's the same exact one.

00:13:01,346 --> 00:13:02,614
Well, that makes sense
to me.

00:13:02,614 --> 00:13:04,382
‐Yeah, for sure.
‐Why <i>wouldn't</i> you want this?

00:13:04,382 --> 00:13:05,517
Got it.

00:13:05,517 --> 00:13:08,386
Every other device ‐‐
smoke, flare, sea dye ‐‐

00:13:08,386 --> 00:13:09,454
It all runs away.

00:13:09,454 --> 00:13:10,522
Lasts seconds or minutes.

00:13:10,522 --> 00:13:12,423
This is the only
continuous signaling device.

00:13:12,423 --> 00:13:14,792
This has saved
four lives already,

00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:17,228
and I need your help...
‐Good for you.

00:13:17,228 --> 00:13:17,862
...to save 4,000 more.

00:13:17,862 --> 00:13:20,532
And one of the guys that I saved
thanked me.

00:13:20,532 --> 00:13:21,633
And that was better

00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:24,335
than any money that I've made
from this already.

00:13:24,335 --> 00:13:25,503
You've got
two sizes there.

00:13:25,503 --> 00:13:27,672
Right.
These are the military versions.

00:13:27,672 --> 00:13:29,541
This is
the fighter‐pilot version.

00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,809
Do you have military
that are buying these now?

00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:33,545
These are patented,
military‐approved,

00:13:33,545 --> 00:13:34,712
and sold all over the world.

00:13:34,712 --> 00:13:36,748
W‐We've done $15 million
in sales.

00:13:36,748 --> 00:13:38,449
‐Wow!
‐Whoa!
‐$15 million?

00:13:38,449 --> 00:13:39,484
‐What?!
‐Wait a minute!

00:13:39,484 --> 00:13:40,752
Then why are you asking
for so little?

00:13:40,752 --> 00:13:43,655
Because here's what happened ‐‐
I licensed the technology.

00:13:43,655 --> 00:13:45,523
This is over a 15‐year period.

00:13:45,523 --> 00:13:47,559
My back story
is my wife got sick.

00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:49,727
She got multiple sclerosis.
‐I'm sorry.

00:13:49,727 --> 00:13:51,763
So she was in a wheelchair
for 19 years.

00:13:51,763 --> 00:13:53,598
And I took care of her,
raised the kids,

00:13:53,598 --> 00:13:55,700
and just like in big‐wave
surfing, you get drilled.

00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,669
You put your head down
and paddle harder.

00:13:57,669 --> 00:14:00,505
I paddled harder.
I led this licensing team.

00:14:00,505 --> 00:14:03,508
And we made fantastic inroads
with the military.

00:14:03,508 --> 00:14:05,443
So you sold the rights
to that.

00:14:05,443 --> 00:14:06,611
The license ended.

00:14:06,611 --> 00:14:08,246
I took it back.
It's a family business.

00:14:08,246 --> 00:14:08,913
It was originally.

00:14:08,913 --> 00:14:12,517
Dr. Rob, that $15 million
over what period of time?

00:14:12,517 --> 00:14:13,518
15 years.

00:14:13,518 --> 00:14:15,587
So, Dr. Rob,
can I see that prop?

00:14:15,587 --> 00:14:17,755
These are
water‐soluble plastic.

00:14:17,755 --> 00:14:19,390

Let me see. Yeah.

00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,525
I have products
for you guys.

00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:21,526
Is this new,

00:14:21,526 --> 00:14:22,760
or that's what
you've already been selling?

00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,762
‐Yeah, we sell it all.
‐Gotcha.

00:14:24,762 --> 00:14:26,931
‐Let me give Lori hers.
‐Thank you.

00:14:26,931 --> 00:14:28,466
For boating, hiking ‐‐
That's the other thing.

00:14:28,466 --> 00:14:30,401
That's all the applications.

00:14:30,401 --> 00:14:31,603
‐It's super smart...
‐Thank you.

00:14:31,603 --> 00:14:33,204
...'cause people do get lost.

00:14:33,204 --> 00:14:33,805
Absolutely.

00:14:33,805 --> 00:14:35,573
‐This is serious stuff.
‐Thank you, Dr. Rob.

00:14:35,573 --> 00:14:37,408
You want
to do a deal, Dr. Rob,

00:14:37,408 --> 00:14:41,279
that just supports
consumer retail sales.

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:41,980
I want it all.

00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,848
This ‐‐ For the first time,
it's available, whole thing.

00:14:43,848 --> 00:14:45,683
You want to start it fresh
in the Shark Tank...

00:14:45,683 --> 00:14:46,818
‐Exactly.
‐... with a new deal

00:14:46,818 --> 00:14:48,519
that goes after the military
<i>and</i> the consumer.

00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:49,520
Correct.

00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,888
So like a rebirth.

00:14:50,888 --> 00:14:53,057
I was a big boater
for many, many years, right?

00:14:53,057 --> 00:14:53,691
Okay.

00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:55,393
And you're always afraid
something's gonna go wrong

00:14:55,393 --> 00:14:56,394
on the boat and so on.
‐Absolutely.

00:14:56,394 --> 00:14:57,562
I had
the little GPS device.

00:14:57,562 --> 00:14:59,530
‐Sure.
‐You could put it on your body.

00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,798
Well, that's a misconception

00:15:00,798 --> 00:15:03,234
that all you need
is the electronics.

00:15:03,234 --> 00:15:04,469
First of all, electronics fail.

00:15:04,469 --> 00:15:06,671
This is no batteries,
chemicals, or electronics.

00:15:06,671 --> 00:15:08,606
There's nothing
to go wrong in this.

00:15:08,606 --> 00:15:09,907
But what do sales
look like?

00:15:09,907 --> 00:15:12,543
They were $200,000 last year,
$250,000 this year.

00:15:12,543 --> 00:15:13,811
Have sales dropped off
from the military

00:15:13,811 --> 00:15:15,580
because they rely
on GPS only now?

00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,482
They've dropped off
because I don't have the backing

00:15:17,482 --> 00:15:18,716
and the funding
of a licensing group.

00:15:18,716 --> 00:15:20,485
Herjavec:
How would you sell this?

00:15:20,485 --> 00:15:21,719
Adventure stores,
hiking stores?

00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:25,423
All that, but I think the
real key is for your loved ones,

00:15:25,423 --> 00:15:26,791
really, 'cause the macho guy

00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,393
doesn't think
they need anything,

00:15:28,393 --> 00:15:29,727
yet parents or their loved ones

00:15:29,727 --> 00:15:31,496
say,
"Yes, you definitely need this."

00:15:31,496 --> 00:15:33,598
And, Dr. Rob,
what do you need the money for?

00:15:33,598 --> 00:15:35,833
I want to get
the big military contracts.

00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:39,137
In parallel,
I want to go for the mandate.

00:15:39,137 --> 00:15:40,405
That's the key.

00:15:40,405 --> 00:15:42,373
These should be
on every life jacket.

00:15:42,373 --> 00:15:44,375
Every life jacket
has floatation,

00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,577
but it should have visibility,
too.

00:15:46,577 --> 00:15:47,845
So what does it cost?

00:15:47,845 --> 00:15:50,615
$78 for the little one.
$118 for the big one.

00:15:50,615 --> 00:15:52,884
I like the idea but only
from what you're telling me ‐‐

00:15:52,884 --> 00:15:55,153
how many lives saved.
how much business you did.

00:15:55,153 --> 00:15:55,653
Right.

00:15:55,653 --> 00:15:57,422
But the real play here is,
you know,

00:15:57,422 --> 00:15:58,556
continue with
the government,

00:15:58,556 --> 00:16:01,592
and, uh,
I can't help you with this.

00:16:01,592 --> 00:16:02,794
So I'm out.

00:16:02,794 --> 00:16:05,630
Okay.
Fair enough. Thank you.

00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,799
I think
it's a great idea,

00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:11,436
but it's a really difficult
journey to start from scratch

00:16:11,436 --> 00:16:13,738
and try to go into
the mass‐retail market.

00:16:13,738 --> 00:16:15,473
It would require
a lot of things.

00:16:15,473 --> 00:16:18,409
I just don't think
it's a mass‐consumer product.

00:16:18,409 --> 00:16:19,544
I'm out.

00:16:19,544 --> 00:16:21,312
Okay. Thank you.

00:16:21,312 --> 00:16:22,547
It's a great product.

00:16:22,547 --> 00:16:23,681
I think you've convinced me
for the military application.

00:16:23,681 --> 00:16:26,617
I see
the commercial application.

00:16:26,617 --> 00:16:30,488
I see lots of challenges
on the consumer side.

00:16:30,488 --> 00:16:32,323
Not for me.
I'm out.

00:16:32,323 --> 00:16:32,857
Okay.

Cuban: Dr. Rob, let me
explain something here.

00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:37,295
Everybody's been saying
the product is great,

00:16:37,295 --> 00:16:37,795
and I agree with them.

00:16:37,795 --> 00:16:40,098
From an investor's
perspective...

00:16:40,098 --> 00:16:40,698
Sure.

00:16:40,698 --> 00:16:42,333
...th‐there's multiple things
I have to consider.

00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,668
One is
how much work's involved.

00:16:43,668 --> 00:16:46,437
The second
is how big can it be.

00:16:46,437 --> 00:16:47,672
But something like a mandate ‐‐

00:16:47,672 --> 00:16:49,574
If ‐‐ If it can be
argued effectively

00:16:49,574 --> 00:16:51,609
that this should be
on every life jacket ‐‐

00:16:51,609 --> 00:16:53,811
But that's a very
binary decision, right?

00:16:53,811 --> 00:16:55,780
So, yeah, maybe that could
take you to $10 million,

00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,648
$15 million, $20 million
in sales or more...

00:16:57,648 --> 00:16:59,684
‐Right.
‐... but you've already
got that ability

00:16:59,684 --> 00:17:00,785
to sell that yourself,
right?

00:17:00,785 --> 00:17:03,454
I'm not gonna come in
and convince the military

00:17:03,454 --> 00:17:04,622
any better
than you can.

00:17:04,622 --> 00:17:07,725
But money can drive the team
that can build it.

00:17:07,725 --> 00:17:10,428
But you're only asking
$200,000.

00:17:10,428 --> 00:17:12,296
That money's only gonna go
so far.

00:17:12,296 --> 00:17:13,631
I think
it's a great business.

00:17:13,631 --> 00:17:15,633
I'm just not quite sure
I could scale it large enough

00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:17,668

the return on investment.

Dr. Rob,
I look at it

00:17:21,506 --> 00:17:23,508
in terms of what can I add
in value.

00:17:23,508 --> 00:17:26,377
I think you nailed it
when you said it's a rebirth.

00:17:26,377 --> 00:17:28,146
It's starting
from scratch.

00:17:28,146 --> 00:17:28,713
It needs infrastructure.

00:17:28,713 --> 00:17:30,481
It needs marketing.
It needs digital.

00:17:30,481 --> 00:17:31,749
It needs social media.
Needs it all.

the case here.

And then you put it
around the chair.

00:32:41,757 --> 00:32:43,726
Or you put it around
the supermarket cart handle.

00:32:43,726 --> 00:32:44,860
And it sells really well.

00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,196
‐How much is this?
‐How much is this?

00:32:47,196 --> 00:32:48,431
$179.

00:32:48,431 --> 00:32:49,398
‐Ohh!
‐Ohh!

00:32:49,398 --> 00:32:50,900
‐Ohh!
‐Lock him up somewhere!

00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,635
How much does it
cost you to make?

00:32:52,635 --> 00:32:54,770
The fabric is proprietary.
It was very expensive for us.

00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:57,506
‐What is it? Mink?
‐No, it's steel mink.

00:32:57,506 --> 00:32:58,941
What's your cost
on it, Don?

00:32:58,941 --> 00:33:01,544
The cost on this bag
that you see today

00:33:01,544 --> 00:33:05,381
manufactured in the U. S.
with this fabric is $75.

00:33:05,381 --> 00:33:06,415
‐Ohh!
‐Ohh!

00:33:06,415 --> 00:33:07,550
Which was a problem for me.

00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,518
Our U. S. manufacturer
couldn't scale.

00:33:09,518 --> 00:33:10,920
I took on a strategic partner.

00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,856
We took it overseas, cut
the cost of this bag in half,

00:33:13,856 --> 00:33:15,758
and then we started getting
a lot of requests

00:33:15,758 --> 00:33:19,495
from mass‐market and retailers
and so forth for a product

00:33:19,495 --> 00:33:20,863
that could fit in, say,

00:33:20,863 --> 00:33:22,031
the largest retailer
in the world.

00:33:22,031 --> 00:33:24,967
Walmart asked you for a version,
and was it $49 or $19.99?

00:33:24,967 --> 00:33:27,436
They wanted to put it
on the shelf for $39.

00:33:27,436 --> 00:33:28,471
‐[ Laughs ]
‐Okay, there you go.

00:33:28,471 --> 00:33:30,406
So it's not this fabric,
obviously.

00:33:30,406 --> 00:33:31,540
It's not this fabric.

00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,675
‐And what's your cost?
‐But what's the...?

00:33:32,675 --> 00:33:37,713
So we got our cost
to sub $15 for that product.

00:33:37,713 --> 00:33:39,615
I have the prototype here
if you would like to take a ‐‐

00:33:39,615 --> 00:33:40,616
What are your sales
today, Don?

00:33:40,616 --> 00:33:41,817
Why don't you show
the prototype?

00:33:41,817 --> 00:33:44,753
All right, so we launched
on Kickstarter five months ago,

00:33:44,753 --> 00:33:48,557
and our goal was to raise
$18,000 to start manufacturing.

00:33:48,557 --> 00:33:51,794
We raised over $855,000.

00:33:51,794 --> 00:33:52,995
How is that
freaking possible?!

00:33:52,995 --> 00:33:54,730
Okay, okay, and there's more.
There's more.

00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:55,965
Well, I think ‐‐ Here's my
thought ‐‐ Don, here's ‐‐

00:33:55,965 --> 00:33:57,700
I'm looking for my ‐‐
I'm looking for our prototype

00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,868
to show you the lower line.

00:33:58,868 --> 00:34:00,002
‐I got it.
‐Well, Don, here ‐‐ here ‐‐

00:34:00,002 --> 00:34:02,438
Here's my thought, Don.
‐Yes, please, get it.

00:34:02,438 --> 00:34:03,405
‐Okay.
‐I'm sorry, Daymond.

00:34:03,405 --> 00:34:04,473
‐No problem.
‐I didn't mean

00:34:04,473 --> 00:34:05,608
to disrespect you.
‐He's getting something?

00:34:05,608 --> 00:34:07,943
It was our ‐‐ the one
for the mass‐market bag.

00:34:07,943 --> 00:34:11,881
So after Kickstarter, we rolled
on to Indiegogo that same day,

00:34:11,881 --> 00:34:15,451
and within 60 days
of launching this product,

00:34:15,451 --> 00:34:17,319
we raised over $1 million.

00:34:17,319 --> 00:34:18,420
‐Ohh!
‐Ohh!

00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,422
‐What?!
‐Fast‐forward today ‐‐

00:34:20,422 --> 00:34:22,625
Our sales are at $1.4 million.

00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:23,792
‐Well, hang on.
‐Including Kickstarter?

00:34:23,792 --> 00:34:25,628
Hang on, your sales through
Indiegogo and Kickstarter ‐‐

00:34:25,628 --> 00:34:27,630
$800,000 and then $1 million?
Or did you do $800,000 ‐‐

00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,931
So it was $855,000
and then another $500,000.

00:34:28,931 --> 00:34:31,534
So, Don, tell us a little bit
about your background.

00:34:31,534 --> 00:34:34,637
So my background
is management consultant.

00:34:34,637 --> 00:34:36,539
I've got an MBA
from Ohio State.

00:34:36,539 --> 00:34:37,640
How did you find the kid?

00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,607
‐I recruited ‐‐
‐He found me on

00:34:38,607 --> 00:34:39,708
an OSU job board.

00:34:39,708 --> 00:34:41,744
I was working a corporate
cubicle internship.

00:34:41,744 --> 00:34:43,546
And I got a call
from this guy.

00:34:43,546 --> 00:34:45,748
And he was like, "Hey, I'm
launching a new product.

00:34:45,748 --> 00:34:48,551
I need some help with
my social media, marketing,

00:34:48,551 --> 00:34:49,785
branding,
website development."

00:34:49,785 --> 00:34:51,754
And he showed me
the product and I was ‐‐

00:34:51,754 --> 00:34:52,955
I mean, I was blown away.

00:34:52,955 --> 00:34:56,659
But he said he couldn't promise
a full‐time job after college.

00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:57,960
He wouldn't
really pay me much.

00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,795
I think he even told me,
like, I'd have to

00:34:59,795 --> 00:35:01,664
clean the bathroom
or something ridiculous.

00:35:01,664 --> 00:35:02,865
Wow.
Do you have any equity yet?

00:35:02,865 --> 00:35:04,633
I'm working
my way towards it.

00:35:04,633 --> 00:35:05,734
‐What?!
‐I feel like ‐‐

00:35:05,734 --> 00:35:07,036
I didn't have any money ‐‐
I didn't have any money

00:35:07,036 --> 00:35:09,004
to pitch in
in the beginning.
Don, what's the matter
with you?

00:35:09,004 --> 00:35:11,607
So I'm working my way,
working my butt off.
You don't give the kid
any equity?

00:35:11,607 --> 00:35:13,008
Don, okay, here's
the thing I can't get over.

00:35:13,008 --> 00:35:17,580
I still don't understand
the fundamental application.

00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,915
I don't think people
in a casual environment

00:35:19,915 --> 00:35:22,818
going out to a café
are gonna lock up their bag.

00:35:22,818 --> 00:35:25,020
Halpern: It's really ‐‐ We found
out there was two tiers.

00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,723
Originally, for me, it was
all about not being stolen.

00:35:27,723 --> 00:35:29,592
But half of our sales
were overseas.

00:35:29,592 --> 00:35:30,793
We sold to 75 different
countries.

00:35:30,793 --> 00:35:33,762
It's about the carrying
and the slashing.

00:35:33,762 --> 00:35:38,400
At $175 or even $100,
you know, in the store,

00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,735
the hanger appeal
is not there.

00:35:39,735 --> 00:35:41,570
I don't necessarily
know what it is.

00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:43,372
It's kind of hard
to translate it.

00:35:43,372 --> 00:35:44,773
And I just didn't know

00:35:44,773 --> 00:35:45,975
the slashing problem
was out like that.

00:35:45,975 --> 00:35:48,644
If you're going to places
that people are slashing stuff

00:35:48,644 --> 00:35:49,712
like that,
you don't need a bag.

00:35:49,712 --> 00:35:51,380
You need
a Desert Eagle, right?

00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,781
[ Laughter ]

00:35:52,781 --> 00:35:55,451
Um, so I just don't
see the application.

00:35:55,451 --> 00:35:56,652
I'm out.

00:35:56,652 --> 00:35:57,620
Respect that.

00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,655
So how are you gonna sell it?

00:35:59,655 --> 00:36:02,758
Two ways. Um, initially,
we were gonna do it all online.

00:36:02,758 --> 00:36:05,694
The product sells itself.
We can create rich content.

00:36:05,694 --> 00:36:07,663
We do ridiculously
cool videos.

00:36:07,663 --> 00:36:09,298
We slash them
with Samurai swords.

00:36:09,298 --> 00:36:09,898
We run over them.

00:36:09,898 --> 00:36:11,600
Yeah, that would be cool.
We hit them with axes.

00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,735
That would be cool.

00:36:12,735 --> 00:36:15,571
Look, guys, the challenge is
you haven't really defined

00:36:15,571 --> 00:36:16,605
how you're gonna sell it.

00:36:16,605 --> 00:36:18,774
I get that you're
gonna create content

00:36:18,774 --> 00:36:21,677
with all the viral videos
and the fun videos you've done.

00:36:21,677 --> 00:36:23,912
I can see that, but I don't see
how that scales at all.

00:36:23,912 --> 00:36:26,515
What is it gonna take
to get people to your website?

00:36:26,515 --> 00:36:27,850
'Cause that is
180 degrees different

00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:30,019
than going to Kickstarter
or Indiegogo.

00:36:30,019 --> 00:36:32,888
It's dependent on
your ability to create content

00:36:32,888 --> 00:36:35,924
not over a 90‐day period
or 120‐day period,

00:36:35,924 --> 00:36:38,627
but over a long‐term
sustained period.

00:36:38,627 --> 00:36:43,632
That's a challenge for me,
and for those reasons, I'm out.

00:36:43,632 --> 00:36:45,534
Don, I like kickboxing.

00:36:45,534 --> 00:36:47,469
Having dinner
with Georges St‐Pierre,

00:36:47,469 --> 00:36:49,371
the big UFC fighter.

00:36:49,371 --> 00:36:49,972
I'm a big fan.

00:36:49,972 --> 00:36:51,874
So I say to him,
"Georges, do you think I could

00:36:51,874 --> 00:36:53,809
get in the ring and I could,
you know, scrap it up

00:36:53,809 --> 00:36:55,678
with a couple of the guys?"

00:36:55,678 --> 00:36:57,880
He looks at me, and he says,
"You know, Robert,

00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,550
everybody has a game plan
until you get hit in the face."

00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:03,585
You haven't been proven

00:37:03,585 --> 00:37:08,557
by the reality
of the marketplace yet.

00:37:08,557 --> 00:37:09,992
I'm out.

00:37:09,992 --> 00:37:13,862
Okay, let me tell you about
getting kicked in the face

00:37:13,862 --> 00:37:15,531
and kind of what
I'm all about

00:37:15,531 --> 00:37:17,533
and why we're going
to be successful.

00:37:17,533 --> 00:37:20,803
Literally
four weeks ago yesterday,

00:37:20,803 --> 00:37:24,940
I was diagnosed with cancer ‐‐
a really nasty, nasty one.

00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,476
I wasn't sure if
I was even going to be able

00:37:27,476 --> 00:37:28,577
to make it here.

00:37:28,577 --> 00:37:30,012
Since then,
I've had two surgeries.

00:37:30,012 --> 00:37:32,681
The first two weeks of
getting diagnosed with cancer,

00:37:32,681 --> 00:37:34,516
you're in a really dark place
'cause you don't know

00:37:34,516 --> 00:37:35,651
if you're gonna see
your next birthday.

00:37:35,651 --> 00:37:37,886
Two surgeries later,
I was on a plane

00:37:37,886 --> 00:37:41,490
to Bentonville, Arkansas,
against the wishes of my doctor,

00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,459
to sit down
and meet with Walmart ‐‐

00:37:43,459 --> 00:37:44,927
a meeting that
isn't easy to get,

00:37:44,927 --> 00:37:47,863
which is just pure brute
strength and driving through.

00:37:47,863 --> 00:37:50,499
We got the meeting,
and they told us flat out,

00:37:50,499 --> 00:37:51,600
"Here's what you need to do.

00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,635
This is gonna be big.
This is gonna be huge.

00:37:53,635 --> 00:37:55,404
Come back to me
with this product."

00:37:55,404 --> 00:37:56,038
That is the product.

00:37:56,038 --> 00:37:58,807
That's how quickly
we go back and we turn things.

00:37:58,807 --> 00:38:00,709
Everything we've done,
we grind it out.

00:38:00,709 --> 00:38:03,712
Don, you're a fighter,
and I congratulate you

00:38:03,712 --> 00:38:06,482
on the work
that you've put into it.

00:38:06,482 --> 00:38:08,684
You've got Lori,
and you've got ‐‐

00:38:08,684 --> 00:38:09,752
Kevin, are you in?

00:38:09,752 --> 00:38:12,121
I'm still listening.
Lori, what are you doing?

00:38:12,121 --> 00:38:16,859
Well, the unique thing about
your bags is you can't slash it.

00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:19,561
To me, the bad news is
is I'm not sure how many people

00:38:19,561 --> 00:38:21,396
are actually slashing bags.

00:38:21,396 --> 00:38:22,064
I like that it locks,

00:38:22,064 --> 00:38:25,601
but you could buy a device
like mine and lock any bag.

00:38:25,601 --> 00:38:28,604
And so there's a lot of
good news‐bad news going on,

00:38:28,604 --> 00:38:31,673
and the worst news is
the price point at the moment.

00:38:31,673 --> 00:38:35,511
And so, unfortunately,
for all of those reasons,

00:38:35,511 --> 00:38:37,613
which was a lot, I'm out.

00:38:37,613 --> 00:38:39,414
Thank you.

00:38:39,414 --> 00:38:40,415
Don, I'm left.

00:38:40,415 --> 00:38:42,885
Um, it's a tough one.

00:38:42,885 --> 00:38:43,919
You got to
understand something.

00:38:43,919 --> 00:38:45,754
After eight years
in the Shark Tank,

00:38:45,754 --> 00:38:47,589
we've seen everything.

00:38:47,589 --> 00:38:49,625
We see what works.
We see what doesn't work.

00:38:49,625 --> 00:38:50,726
We look at the risk.

00:38:50,726 --> 00:38:53,562
I don't think you should
go to Walmart.

00:38:53,562 --> 00:38:54,730
You're kicking it out
of the park

00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:56,498
just doing
social and digital.

00:38:56,498 --> 00:38:57,533
And maybe you should
stay there.

00:38:57,533 --> 00:38:59,468
The price point's
extremely high.

00:38:59,468 --> 00:39:01,970
I'll take a flyer on it,
and it's ‐‐

00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:03,705
I'm not interested in
negotiating with you.

00:39:03,705 --> 00:39:06,375
I'll make you an offer.
If you don't want it, I'm okay.

00:39:13,615 --> 00:39:14,750
Narrator: Four Sharks are out.

00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:17,719
Don and Adam
are seeking $150,000

00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:21,657
for 5% of their slash‐proof
locking bag company Loctote.

00:39:21,657 --> 00:39:23,759
Kevin is their last chance
for a deal.

00:39:23,759 --> 00:39:25,027
O'Leary: I'm not interested
in negotiating with you.

00:39:25,027 --> 00:39:28,730
I'll make you an offer.
If you don't want it, I'm okay.

00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:30,899
This is a classic
Mr. Wonderful royalty deal

00:39:30,899 --> 00:39:32,868
if I ever saw one
because there's not enough

00:39:32,868 --> 00:39:35,537
equity in this to make it
interesting for me.

00:39:35,537 --> 00:39:37,940
I'll give you the $150,000.
I want 10%.

00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:41,944
But I want 10 bucks a bag
until I recoup $450,000.

00:39:41,944 --> 00:39:44,646
I'll work like hell
to get the word out.

00:39:44,646 --> 00:39:45,747
I just want to stay digital.

00:39:45,747 --> 00:39:48,450
So at the end of the day,
that's my offer.

00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:49,852
I think you understand it.

00:39:49,852 --> 00:39:53,755
Mr. Wonderful, what I would
like to counter to you with is,

00:39:53,755 --> 00:39:54,957
first of all,
what we really need

00:39:54,957 --> 00:39:57,726
is a line of credit for
the large purchase orders.

00:39:57,726 --> 00:39:59,561
That means you want
to stay in retail.

00:39:59,561 --> 00:40:01,730
Potentially,
with the low‐end product.

00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:04,299
I don't believe
in the low‐end product, Don.

00:40:04,299 --> 00:40:05,634
I actually don't.

00:40:05,634 --> 00:40:06,835
My vision of
what you're doing ‐‐

00:40:06,835 --> 00:40:08,570
And you shouldn't
do the deal with me

00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:09,738
if we disagree on this ‐‐

00:40:09,738 --> 00:40:12,841
Retail is a whole
different deal.

00:40:12,841 --> 00:40:14,743
Yeah, I would not
do retail at all.

00:40:14,743 --> 00:40:16,879
Your offer is
intriguing to me

00:40:16,879 --> 00:40:18,680
because what I'm hearing
you say is you want

00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,616
to keep your risk down,
you want your money back,

00:40:20,616 --> 00:40:21,950
and you would like
a 10% piece of my company.

00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,986
It's a product because
I want ‐‐ If there is upside,

00:40:23,986 --> 00:40:25,721
I want schmuck insurance.
‐That's what he's saying.

00:40:25,721 --> 00:40:26,822
Exactly,
so here's what I ‐‐

00:40:26,822 --> 00:40:29,591
Let me repackage
schmuck insurance for you

00:40:29,591 --> 00:40:30,792
in a different way.

00:40:30,792 --> 00:40:33,695
So I would like to offer you
the 5%, as we said,

00:40:33,695 --> 00:40:36,632
at $150,000,
at the $3 million valuation.

00:40:36,632 --> 00:40:37,900
And then I would like
to give you an option

00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:41,036
to purchase additional equity
at a $10 million valuation

00:40:41,036 --> 00:40:44,406
to be used at any point in time,
including a liquidity event.

00:40:44,406 --> 00:40:45,507
That's a kiss‐off
offer to me.

00:40:45,507 --> 00:40:47,709
You take my $150,000.
You try and grow it.

00:40:47,709 --> 00:40:48,810
I never see it back.

00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:50,078
The royalty has to
stay in place.

00:40:50,078 --> 00:40:53,515
You can afford it if you stay
digital and you go social.

00:40:53,515 --> 00:40:55,484
The schmuck insurance
for me is the 10%.

00:40:55,484 --> 00:40:57,552
Whatever happens,
if I have 10%

00:40:57,552 --> 00:40:58,954
and I can make this thing bigger

00:40:58,954 --> 00:41:00,689
and I still have an option
in the company,

00:41:00,689 --> 00:41:02,491
of course I'm gonna
work for you.

00:41:02,491 --> 00:41:03,759
So your royalty ‐‐
You're not ‐‐

00:41:03,759 --> 00:41:05,827
He's not negotiable
on the royalty, Don.
It's not royalty.

00:41:05,827 --> 00:41:08,630
I'm taking 10 bucks a bag
until I get $450,000 back,

00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:09,831
and then it stops.

00:41:09,831 --> 00:41:11,733
I appreciate that,
Mr. Wonderful.

00:41:11,733 --> 00:41:14,636
And I certainly want you
to have your 10% upside

00:41:14,636 --> 00:41:15,971
because I do want you
to get out of bed.

00:41:15,971 --> 00:41:19,374
But, Don, are you willing
to pay him the $10 per bag

00:41:19,374 --> 00:41:21,476
until he gets $450,000 ‐‐

00:41:21,476 --> 00:41:22,911
three times
his initial investment?

00:41:22,911 --> 00:41:24,680
That's a little bit rich,
Mr. Wonderful.

00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,881
Not really.

00:41:25,881 --> 00:41:28,517
That's ‐‐ I mean, believe me,
I'm in awe of your greed.

00:41:28,517 --> 00:41:29,651
[ Laughter ]
Thank you.

00:41:29,651 --> 00:41:32,254
‐And I respect it.
‐Don, what are you gonna do?

00:41:33,855 --> 00:41:38,961
We will do the $150,000
for 10% equity.

00:41:38,961 --> 00:41:42,931
We'll do a $10 royalty per bag
on any of the bags

00:41:42,931 --> 00:41:45,701
until your capital
is returned at 1x,

00:41:45,701 --> 00:41:46,969
which will be within
the first year.

00:41:46,969 --> 00:41:49,571
‐I'll do that deal.
‐Yeah, Robert. Smart man.

00:41:49,571 --> 00:41:51,606
I'll do that deal all day long.

00:41:51,606 --> 00:41:52,741
‐Let's do it.
‐Do we have a deal?

00:41:52,741 --> 00:41:54,476
‐Do it.
‐Wow!

00:41:54,476 --> 00:41:55,711
‐Yeah, we have a deal!
‐Yeah!

00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,945
Good job, Robert.

00:41:56,945 --> 00:42:00,782
I'm sitting here and thinking,
"Why wouldn't he take that deal?

00:42:00,782 --> 00:42:02,718
That's incredible."
‐I never send my dough out

00:42:02,718 --> 00:42:04,419
unless I get returns ever.

00:42:04,419 --> 00:42:05,387
All right,
good luck, guys.

00:42:05,387 --> 00:42:05,887
‐Thank you.
‐Good luck.

00:42:05,887 --> 00:42:07,389
‐Good luck, guys.
‐Appreciate it.

00:42:07,389 --> 00:42:08,490
Whoo!

00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:09,958
Whoo!
Yeah, baby!

00:42:09,958 --> 00:42:11,960
Oh, my God!
I didn't see
that coming at all.

00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,529
Whoa!
I really thought Robert was ‐‐
just had no interest.

00:42:14,529 --> 00:42:15,731
No.
He laid there in the woods,

00:42:15,731 --> 00:42:18,633
waiting, and then at the end
of the deal, he pounced.

00:42:18,633 --> 00:42:20,869
That was incredible.
We couldn't have been happier.

00:42:20,869 --> 00:42:22,637
We wanted Robert
from the moment

00:42:22,637 --> 00:42:24,439
we started talking
about the show.

00:42:24,439 --> 00:42:26,441
So that's just awesome.
Yeah.
