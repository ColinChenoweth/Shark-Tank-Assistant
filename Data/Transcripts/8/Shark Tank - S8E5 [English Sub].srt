00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,686
Without knowing them, they
have over $8 million in sales

00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:00,720
after three years.

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,922
Pretty remarkable.
Yeah.

00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,791
But I'll tell you something ‐‐
She does it all on social media.

00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,526
She's a genius at marketing.
Yeah.

00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,528
It's a new world.
If you just shadow her,

00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:09,796
you're gonna explode
your business.

00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,998
But I'd like an answer
right now.

00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:13,900
The only thing
that's hard for me is ‐‐

00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,735
I know the company
that you're talking about.
Mm‐hmm.

00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,604
And I know their style,
and it's a li‐‐

00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,239
It's different than what I am.
Oh, no, no, no. That's ‐‐

00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,875
I mean, in fact, it's something
I would never wear myself.
Let me tell you something.

00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,944
They wouldn't have anything
to do with your design.

00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,846
You're the designer here just
as she's the designer there.

00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:29,616
This is to learn
the back‐end operation,

00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,551
the manufacturing,
the marketing,

00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,653
the online marketing, okay?
Mm‐hmm.

00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:34,821
That's what
they're great at.

00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:38,325
Listen, the 20% gives them
the ‐‐ the incentive to do this.

00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:42,929
I would love ‐‐

00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,665
Greiner: So, Melissa,
I'm gonna tell you something.

00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:46,900
You know,
when I think about...

00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,668
The minute ‐‐
The minute she gives ‐‐

00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:51,371
The minute she gives
her offer, I'm out.

00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,974
♪♪

00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,716
Narrator:
Three Sharks are out.

00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:05,552
Melissa has one offer
on the table from Barbara

00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:07,887
for her kids' clothing line,
SandiLake,

00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:11,891
but she must make a decision now
before hearing out Lori.

00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,860
Greiner:
When I think about...
The minute she gives ‐‐

00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,563
The minute she gives
her offer, I'm out.

00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,965
‐When I think about...
‐Oh.

00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,600
Wait, wait, wait.
This is really interesting.

00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,634
...things that have
happened to people...

00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:22,669
‐Oh.
‐Wait, Melissa.

00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:23,903
‐Come on.
‐You know what she just said?

00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:25,872
... in...
If you let her keep talking,
she's gonna go out.

00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,741
No, no. I said the minute
she gives her offer,

00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,009
but I also don't want
to hear the pitch.

00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,511
Oh, no.
Now, that's nasty, Barbara...
It muddies the water.

00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,612
...because you're trying
to lay it on me.

00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,481
‐It's the Shark Tank.
‐I love it. I love it.

00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:35,615
That's part of business,
making a decision.

00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:36,783
She's trying to put
the blame on me.

00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:38,551
If you walk out of here
without a deal, you're an idiot.

00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:39,853
You know what's interesting?

00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,055
Melissa, take a moment
of silence and think about it.
I ruin it for her.

00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:44,791
You're welcome to move on
to Lori and away from me.
You get that?

00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,360
But think about it
and say yes or no to me.

00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,698
Barbara, I love your offer,

00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,701
but I would like to hear
what Kevin and Lori have to say.

00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:55,735
Kevin's out.
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:56,903
Melissa, Kevin was out
a long time ago.

00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,671
You said you were happy with it,
so our relationship is over.

00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,306
Oh! I would love to hear
what Lori had to say.

00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,341
And I do ‐‐
‐I'm out.

00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:02,375
‐Oh!
‐Aah!

00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,643
‐Oh!
‐Wow.

00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,413
Oh!
Lori, you better
make it good.

00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:07,414
Wow.

00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:12,552
Now, here's what I will share,
what I was going to say...
Oh!

00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,587
which, Barbara,
I like you, I respect you.

00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:17,924
But before I even said
if I'm giving an offer

00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:20,060
or not giving an offer,
then she went out,

00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,463
so now it's all on my shoulders
how you lost a deal

00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:24,964
or didn't lose a deal.

00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:27,534
That's the way it goes.
This is the Shark Tank.
These kinds of situations
because...

00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:28,668
You ‐‐ You know what?
It's your fault.

00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:29,836
You wouldn't make a decision.
I‐I know.

00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:30,937
Corcoran:
Lori, I wouldn't have done it

00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,572
if you hadn't kept butting in
as I was talking.

00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,573
I respect my fellow Sharks,
I respect Barbara,

00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,674
but, Barbara ‐‐
Butting in.

00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,409
...I don't think
you need an offer from me.

00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,646
Wow.
What would be great
is for you

00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:41,681
to keep growing this
slowly...

00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:42,749
Oh.
Wow.

00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:43,817
...building
and building it,

00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:47,687
and I don't want to be
in this business.

00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,689
I'm sorry.
I'm out.

00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,825
But I think
you're going to be great.

00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:53,593
Thank you.
And you can do it,

00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,062
and you can do it
your way.

00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,666
The lesson is, you should have
taken that phenomenal offer

00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:00,733
when you had a chance.

00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:01,935
Instead, you squandered
your opportunity.

00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,571
Great offer.
Now you're paying
a horrible price.

00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:05,738
It's terrible.

00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:08,741
This is a classic case, which
happens in business every day,

00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,677
of curiosity killed the cat.

00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:11,845
For me, though,
it was the deal.

00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:13,246
It was that I would be teaming
up with another company,

00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:15,682
and I want to work with ‐‐
That's a great ‐‐ great logic.
Then ‐‐ Then that's fine.

00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:17,150
But, Melissa, that's...
That's great logic.

00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,652
And I want to work with
an investor who wants me...
But that's your confidence.

00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:20,687
my product for me.

00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:22,188
We ‐‐ We wish you
the best, Melissa.

00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:22,689
Thank you.

00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:23,623
‐Good luck.
‐Everybody's out.

00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,724
‐Thank you.
‐Thank you.

00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,426
And you have two beautiful
children. Congratulations.

00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:27,160
‐Thank you.
‐Definitely.

00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,964
Melissa: I came to "Shark Tank"
to get a deal with an investor

00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,833
who believes in me
as an entrepreneur.

00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,869
I didn't come here
to make a deal

00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:37,837
to team up
with some other company.

00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,607
I want who invests in me
to believe in me.

00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:42,642
I thought that was jacked up,
because ‐‐

00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,612
What was jacked up?
Because I ‐‐
One, I hadn't ‐‐

00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:48,348
I had not decided yet
what I wanted to do.

00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:48,848
You put her on the clock.

00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,383
Yeah, we do that.
It's what we do.

00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:50,950
We're Sharks.
‐Of course.

00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,685
I wanted to talk to her ‐‐
That's what we do.

00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,053
I thought that you were
a good partner.

00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:57,524
Look, at the end of the day,
she didn't accept the offer,

00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:58,892
she didn't seize opportunity.

00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:02,829
And we can talk all we want.
She left without a deal.

00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:06,599
You can't come in here
not knowing your numbers!

00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,568
This is the Shark Tank.
We're gonna kill you.

00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:09,669
People ask me all the time,

00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,571
"Why are you so mean
on 'Shark Tank'?"

00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:13,540
I'm not mean.
I'm just telling the truth

00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,508
through the experiences
I've lived.

00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,610
I was born
into a working‐class family.

00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,112
I struggled
like everybody else did.

00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:22,415
My mother was from Lebanese
descent, my father was Irish.

00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:23,516
He was a salesman.

00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,652
He sold winter clothing
for children.

00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:27,787
I was about 7 years old
when my father died.

00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,956
Those were very tough years
for me.

00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:32,559
My dad died
when he was 37 years old,

00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,893
leaving my mother alone
with two children

00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:36,696
and a very uncertain future
ahead.

00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,499
Life being what it is,
changes all the time,

00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:41,601
my mother
met a fellow named George.

00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:44,737
The two of them married,
and life changed dramatically.

00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:48,508
My stepdad joined the ILO, a
division of the United Nations.

00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:49,576
We lived everywhere.

00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:51,477
We moved to Cambodia, Cyprus,

00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:54,514
Tunisia, Japan,
France, Switzerland.

00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:55,782
Every two years,
a different country.

00:11:55,782 --> 00:11:58,785
Looking back at all the unique
cultures I've been steeped in,

00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:01,654
you understand everybody's
challenges in the world,

00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:03,523
not just your own.

00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:05,525
My stepdad's
a very pragmatic individual.

00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:06,659
He tells it like it is.

00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,494
I think I learned that trait
from him.

00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:09,596
When I got out of college,

00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:11,831
I wanted to be a photographer
and a rock star,

00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,733
and I tried being a hippie
for a few years.

00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,502
My stepfather said to me,
"You're gonna starve to death.

00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:17,904
You should go back to school
right now."

00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,406
When I graduated,
I started my first company,

00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,507
Special Event Television.

00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,576
It made sports programming
for the networks.

00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,712
Then SoftKey
started in my basement,

00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:27,714
which eventually became
The Learning Company.

00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:30,950
And a few years later,
I sold it for $4.2 billion.

00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,519
Exactly.
If you guys
loved it so much,

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,788
how come not a dime
from any of you?

00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,358
A lot of people see me as
the harsh guy on "Shark Tank."

00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:39,425
It's so not true.

00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,860
Would you rather
have me lie to you

00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,929
because I'm worried
about your feelings?

00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,497
I don't care
about your <i>feelings.</i>

00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:45,565
I care about your <i>money.</i>

00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:46,799
A Shark that is disingenuous,

00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,635
that tries
to keep you feeling good

00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:50,703
when they know
your idea has no merit

00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,805
is doing you a huge disservice.

00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,841
Today I'm really proud
to be an entrepreneur

00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:57,710
and to help entrepreneurs
so they can create jobs.

00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,813
There's nothing more noble
in America than doing that.

00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:04,284
You don't start a business
out of greed

00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:04,851
or the pursuit of money.

00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:06,753
You do it
for the pursuit of freedom.

00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:07,920
But I realized
in the early years

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,789
I didn't have a lot of time
for my young kids.

00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:10,990
I was so busy with my business.

00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,860
So now I try and spend
as much time as I can with them.

00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,863
Everything you see
around you here, I made myself.

00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:20,566
I worked like hell for it, and
I'm not embarrassed about it.

00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,735
I'm proud to be a capitalist.

00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:26,606
If I could go back in time
and speak to my dad, I'd say,

00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:28,908
"Look, you taught me a lot

00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,065
I started this
with my own money.

00:35:00,065 --> 00:35:03,702
I only invested $5,000
into it...
Cuban: Good for you.

00:35:03,702 --> 00:35:04,903
... and that was the only
investment I've ever made.

00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:06,504
‐Good for you.
‐I got to tell you ‐‐

00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:07,572
Where do you see your sales
going for the next year?

00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:08,740
For the next year ‐‐
That's why I'm here.

00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,675
The sky's the limit.
It's gonna be endless.

00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:12,043
We project this year ‐‐

00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:14,946
Conservatively, we're
gonna do $200,000 in sales.
He's like Peter Pan.

revenue streams

00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:18,550
that we'd like to pursue.
Like what?

00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,818
Uh, licensing, for one.

00:35:19,818 --> 00:35:21,820
What would you license
and to who?

00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,722
Um, did you see
your SiliDog tag?

00:35:23,722 --> 00:35:25,690
Yeah. Okay, so,
like a Mavs logo or whatever?

00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,325
Or the Florida logo?
Yeah.

00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:27,859
Right. Got it.

00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:29,661

you're killing it.

you need the money for?

00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:34,499
We need the money
for more inventory.

The inventory that we bought

00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,635
we thought we were gonna have
for the year.

00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:37,836
We sold it in three months.

00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:40,071
We need to have this
going from 100 tags a day

00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:42,674
to thousands of tags a day
and just popping them out.

00:35:42,674 --> 00:35:44,643

Where are you
manufacturing these?

00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,478
We make them all
out of my garage.

In your garage?
Yes.

this is really an investment.

their $100,000.

$100,000 after paying myself.

00:35:57,722 --> 00:35:59,691

the dog‐tag thing.

00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:00,859

you've done a great job.

You've hustled.
You've made money.

00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,933
A lot of these guys
are into the pet industry.

00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:12,404
I'm not in that business,
and so I'm out.

00:36:12,404 --> 00:36:14,472
Okay.

I think you're
a phenomenal money manager.

00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:17,842

with a really unique way

00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:23,815

before somebody even orders.

a customized business,

anything's customized,

a real business out of it.

00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:44,569

in the world except you

00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:46,471
could have sold
100,000 of this.

a great brand.

for 50%.

I appreciate the offer.

00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:06,791
I did not expect to come in
with 50% to give it,

even have an offer on the table,

00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:11,529

But wait.
There could be more.

00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:15,600
You remind me
of my ScreenMend girls.

00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,435
Well, they were
younger than you.

00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:18,770

this great product.

out of the garage.

And I did the deal
with them,

00:37:24,943 --> 00:37:28,613
and they have now surpassed
$8 million in sales.

00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:30,815
So similar.
But it took a lot of work.

00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:35,620
I had to get them out of the
garage and into major retailers

00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,722
and with
a major manufacturer.

00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:41,359
I think that to give you
an offer of the $100,000,

00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,429
I would have to get 51%.

00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,431

is the experience

with the ScreenMend.
