this is amazing sauce.

retailer in the world, Walmart,

00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,860
did a manufacturing summit
last year.

00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,530

00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,397
Oh, yeah,
we're not selling a lot online.

00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:08,401
John: You know,
170 stores, 500 a week

00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:12,639
is an average of only 2 1/2
bottles a week per store.

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,642
That's our challenge, you know,
because we're so brand‐new.
Yeah.

00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,777
I don't think
this is gonna work.

00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,547
This is never gonna be
a big online business.

00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,349
I'm sorry.
It weighs too much.

00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:25,518
And it's a competitive space.
It's a commodity.

To differentiate your product,

00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,823
this is
a massive branding exercise.

00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:05,625
Thank you so much
for your feedback.

00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,594
You know, Kevin,
time‐out.

00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:11,431
You sell online
glass jarred cupcakes.

00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,233
Yes. And they weigh ‐‐
They're glass.

00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:14,501
They weigh 1/10 of this.

00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:16,202
Our whole deal
is to take the weight out.

00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:17,237
They're not liquid.

00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:18,605
I've lived this nightmare.

00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,774
The whole shipping thing
is beyond a challenge.

00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,509
John: Let me ‐‐
Let me give you my thoughts.

00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:25,378
First of all, great.

00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:26,746
The food ‐‐ amazing.

00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:31,551
It is ‐‐ The sauce, bring
a tear to a glass eye, right?

00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,253
Amazing.
I'm hungry.

00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:34,354
A tear to a glass eye?

00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:35,755
Yeah, yeah.
That's how serious I am.

00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,590
I don't know. Let me tell you
what I went through

00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,725
and how I experienced this.

00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:41,528
I‐I‐I did a deal called
Bubba Baker's Boneless Ribs,

00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:44,431
and Bubba had sauces.

00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:47,233
What we found out ‐‐
It was so hard

00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,336
to sell
barbecue sauce online

00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,504
because people
can't visually taste it,

00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:53,640
they're very, very heavy,
and a lot of breakage.

00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,443
We ended up selling
the barbecue sauce

00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:58,511
because the barbecue sauce
was in the ribs,

00:07:58,511 --> 00:07:59,646
a small sample of it.

00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,581
People would taste it
and then reorder.

00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,416
But if we didn't have
that lead‐in

00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,386
to grab the people
to give them the tasting,

00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:07,687
we would have never sold
any sauce,

00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:11,658
and I know the issues here,
and I can't help you with this.

00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,193
Before you ‐‐
So I'm out.

00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:13,793
Okay. Thank you.

00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:17,430
I find the product packaging
a little confusing.

00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,333
Consumers are very fickle.

00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,336
When they walk though
that shelf space,

00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,438
you know,
it looks very Asian to me.

00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:26,539
Jorrae: Mm‐hmm.
Right.

00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:29,342
I ‐‐ And then I see
"barbecue sauce,"

00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,211
and yet you told me
it's good for everything.

00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:32,545
Everything.
Right.

00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:35,648
I think you've come
a really, really long way.

00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:39,219
You bagged a massive elephant
in terms of Walmart.

00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:40,387
You've got a great test.

00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:41,554
You know, the branding
will probably have

00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,490
to change a little bit,

00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,627
but it almost feels to me
like it's at the beginning.

00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:50,463
Amazing job, but I just
don't think I'm the partner

00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,599
at this point for you.

00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:53,633
Okay.
I'm out.

00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:54,667
Well, thank you.
Thank you.

00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:55,835
Thank you so much.
Thank you very much.

00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:58,872
Greiner: When I look at you,
reminds me of a saying ‐‐

00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:02,675
"Some women fear the fire.
Some women become it."

00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:07,414
You have become it, and
you have done an amazing job.
Mm‐hmm.

00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:09,349
And you have an amazing partner
in Walmart.

00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,651
For me,
when I invest in something,

00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,920
I like to invest
in things that are unique.

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,290
But there are a million
barbecue sauces out there,

00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,026
and for that reason, I'm out.

00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,028
Thank you.

00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,398
Cuban: Guys, you deserve
a ton of credit.

00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,334
My challenge is,
I need to see a company

00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,637
that's going to do
$10 million in sales

00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:33,506
or $50 million in sales
over the next 10 years,

00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:34,574
even five years, right?

00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,609
But we're definitely
that company, Mark.

00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,445
I know you want to be.
I know you want to be.

00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:40,413
Well, I believe that we are,
and here's why ‐‐

00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,782
because we've had conversations
with Walmart

00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,984
and with ShopRite,
and all of those guys.

00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:49,189
The expansion piece of it,
we've got that nailed, you know?
Yes.

00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:50,557
It will happen.
Mm‐hmm.

00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:52,625
It's just not gonna happen
in the next two or three years.

00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,361
Even if you get out
to 1,000 stores

00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,130
selling, you know,
700 a week,

00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:57,797
your business will grow,

00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:00,366
and it'll be a great,
profitable business for you,

00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:01,601
but that doesn't
necessarily mean

00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,736
it's an investable business
for me.

00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:06,706
So, for those reasons, I'm out,
but, again, congratulations.

00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:09,642
Thank you.
You guys
deserve just a ton of credit.

00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,177
‐Thanks.
‐Good luck, ladies.

00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:12,178
Good luck.
‐Good luck, guys.

00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:13,279
Thank you.

00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,483
Kelly:
You know what?

00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:20,220
I do not feel like
it was a wasted effort.

00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,488
I would do it all again.

00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:25,492
We know that it's going
to be the sauce

00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:27,594
in every single household.

00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:29,562
It's not a matter of if...

00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:30,797
but when.
But when.

00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,333
The chances of that
actually being successful,

00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,601
even with the Walmart ‐‐
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:36,636
Herjavec: You are so ‐‐
Oh, no.
Walmart will get behind them.

00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,438
‐Success is relative.
‐Did you know everything

00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:39,539
when you started
your first business?

00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:40,940
Look, I'm looking at it
saying "no chance."

00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,476
It's a total commodity.
Kevin, what you're missing ‐‐
What you're missing is ‐‐

00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,744
So, they are dying to take
a company like that.

00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:45,979
I'm not missing anything.
You can sell it ‐‐

00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,113
I noticed you didn't put
a dime into it.

00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:47,780
‐What?
‐The issue is scale.

00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,549
It's not whether or not
they'll be profitable,

00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:52,418
because they can sell it, they
can hire more people to sell it.

00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:53,686
It's just how much.
$500,000 a year ‐‐

00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,388
My whole point
about these dialogues

00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,456
we're having with these people

00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:57,757
with all this glowing
encouragement is,

00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,425
you're not giving them
the real risk profile

00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:00,560
of what they're spending
their time doing.

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,828
Okay, let's ‐‐ Okay, Kevin,
let's talk about the ‐‐

00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,463
That's the truth.
Let's talk
about the risk profile.

00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:04,364
That's the truth.
Kevin, you're an idiot.

00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:05,798
Okay, let me tell you ‐‐
Let me tell you ‐‐

00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:07,467
Somebody needs
to tell them the truth.

00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:08,701
Thank goodness I'm here, Mark.
Thank goodness I'm here.

00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:09,769
So, Kevin ‐‐ Kevin,
do you think maybe ‐‐

00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,304
Because, you know,
all this glowing stuff,

00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:12,739
that means the three of them
spend the next two years

00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,507
trying to sell a hot sauce?
Listen to me, Kevin!
Listen!

00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,608
I'm not doing
this "Kumbaya" stuff.

00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,143
No, I'm not saying "Kumbaya."
And she has another job.

00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:17,810
You said they should stop.

00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,546
They should really assess
whether or not it's worth

00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,481
the next two years
to try and take ‐‐

00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:22,615
Abso‐[bleep]‐lutely.

00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,350
‐Look how far she's come.
‐What are we supposed to do?

00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,518
Wait a minute.
What are we supposed to do?

00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,487
Say, "You know what?
Give up."
My point is...

00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:28,788
"Don't keep going because you're
never gonna get anywhere."

00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:30,490
...I would like to see
a little more truth.

00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,692
Then don't ‐‐ Look.
How about telling them
the truth?

00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,660
Kevin ‐‐
What's wrong with that?

00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,827
But you don't know
the truth.

00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,496
And what would you have said
about my earring organizer?

00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:37,597
It's like Daymond
selling T‐shirts.

00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:39,332
Because do you know
how many people said to me,

00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:40,400
"This is never gonna go
anywhere."

00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,401
‐The best ‐‐
‐Look.

00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:42,535
"You're not gonna get
in any stores.

00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,636
Nobody needs this product."

00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,371
If I had listened
to any of them,

00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,606
I would not be
where I am today.

00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:48,541
If I tried to find the hardest
profit category to go into...

00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,642
I'm gonna go eat
some barbecue sauce.

00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:50,910
...to get market share in,
I think it would be

00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,712
the barbecue‐sauce business.
I remember
the guy who told me ‐‐

00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,480
There is no such thing
as an easy business.

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,815
‐Oh, my God. Order in the Tank.
‐She knows that.

00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,284
O'Leary: But there
are some businesses
that are born in hell,

00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,385
and this is one of them.

00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,454
I would rather work
80 hours a week to make 50K

00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:04,557
and work for myself than
have a $75,000, $100,000 job

00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,459
working for somebody else.
Greiner: Exactly.

00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,394
If ‐‐ If you guys
loved it so much,

00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,630
how come not a dime
from any of you ‐‐

00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,065
It's her business.
It's her business.
Not one dime.

00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,801
Just this "Kumbaya"
you keep going stuff.
We all gave good excuses.

00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:17,036
We didn't sit here
going, "Kumbaya."
Good excuses?

00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:17,737
I told them the truth.

00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,305
I didn't have
to give them an excuse.

00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,174
Shame on you.
Shame on <i>you.</i>

00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:22,909
Where's your eject button?

00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,517
♪♪

00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,820
Narrator: Next up
is an idea to ease the hassle

00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,156
of packing
and traveling with luggage.

00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:44,831
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Aaron.

00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:47,567
And I'm Andrew.
We're the co‐founders of unPack.

00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:49,569
Today we're seeking
a $500,000 investment

00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:51,404
for 40% equity
of our company.

00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:53,706
Sharks, we both flew here
from New York,

00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:56,843
and I paid $50
to check my bag on a plane.
50 bucks.

00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:59,312
For that kind of money,
flying must have been a breeze.

00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,481
Actually, I wasted
more time packing,

00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:02,715
took me longer
to get to the airport,

00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,851
and then when we landed,
I had to wait 30 minutes

00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:07,620
just to pick up my bag.
Huh, I didn't pack a thing.

00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,522
I just wore the clothes
on my back.

00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:10,657
What do you mean,
you didn't pack?

00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:12,525
Well, I used unPack.
unPack?

00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:13,593
Where did your clothes
come from?

00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:14,727
Did you steal them?

00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,629
No, I didn't steal them,
but they're not my clothes.

00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,764
UnPack's clothes are better.

00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:20,466
How did unPack's clothes
get here?
Good question.

00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,734
I just went
to unPack's website,

00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,469
told them where I was going
and when,

00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,537
and then
when I got to my hotel,

00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,539
everything I needed
was waiting for me.

00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,675
So, premium,
location‐aligned luggage

00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:31,778
waiting at your hotel
so you don't have to pack.

00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:34,414
How can you afford that?
You're not gonna like this,
Aaron,

00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:36,416
but I paid less than you did
to check your bag.

00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,418
Cheaper than my checked bag?

00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,453
You know, I practically
brought my whole closet here,

00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:42,422
and I still feel like
I've got on the wrong clothes.

00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:43,523
Yeah,
I don't have that problem.

00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,625
UnPack is
my personal concierge.

00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,594
When I go to L. A.,
I'm dressed for L. A.

00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:51,764
You think someone like me
could ever unPack?
No.

00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,433
But since
we're on national television,

00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:54,667
we're gonna make
an exception.

00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,503
And just remember ‐‐ Everything
you need is already there.

00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:01,040
Everything I need
is already there.

00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:08,514
Sharks, unPack
is ready for takeoff.

00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,683
Who's coming with us?

00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:14,587
Okay, Abbott and Costello.
Tell us about what it costs...

00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,422
Yep.
... what we can ship,
what we can't ship,

00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:17,523
et cetera, et cetera.

00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,792
Sure. So, right now,
we're shipping everything.

00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:22,495
So we're doing
your entire set of clothing.

00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:23,596
We're doing
underwear and socks.

00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:24,797
Those you get to keep.

00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:28,067
Then the only thing we're not
doing is shoes, to date.

00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:28,735
Are they men and women?

00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:30,470
‐Men and women, yes.
‐So, you're ‐‐

00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,538
The majority of our customers
to date have been men, though.

00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,141
But are they used clothes?
They're used clothes.

00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:35,808
‐What?
‐So, you recycle them?

00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,477
‐But they're someone else's?
‐You're kidding.

00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:38,811
Like ‐‐ Like,
you ship them to L. A.,

00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:41,614
I‐I show up ‐‐
I show up at the hotel.
Yep.

00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:44,283
They're there.
I wear my clothes.
Yep.

00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:45,618
I put them back in the box.
Yep.

00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:46,953
I ship them back.
That's right.

00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:49,389
You clean them.
And then I have to wear
Mark's clothes?

00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,690
And then the next guy
wears them.

00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,725
You get a chance
to be Mark Cuban.
I mean, how do you do that?

00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,327
Well, wait a minute.
That's kind of horrifying.

00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:56,129
I don't want
to be Mark Cuban!

00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:56,796
John:
Well, all the sizes.

00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:58,531
What are they ‐‐ a bunch
of ponchos or something?

00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:00,767
You fill out a profile that's
very similar to other companies

00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:03,836
in the style‐curation
and clothing‐delivery space.

00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,905
So we learn a lot about your
size and style preferences.

00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,608
And then once we know your
brands that you already wear,

00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:10,476
we're able to put together
a pack that works for you

00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:11,644
in the context
in which you're traveling.

00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:13,312
‐What was the age group?
‐And ‐‐ And how much is it?

00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,447
‐$20 a day.
‐$20 a day.

00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:17,250
I go on vacation for five days,
it's $100?

00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,284
Five days, $100.
Yeah.

00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,652
Okay, got it.

00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,822
So, I have a hard time
having things fit me right.

00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:25,691
Yeah.
I would be more worried
about what's in that package

00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:28,661
sitting there waiting for me,
and I've brought nothing else...
Mm‐hmm.

00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,564
...that maybe doesn't fit
or I don't like it or whatever.
Mm‐hmm.

00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:32,832
What happens
if it doesn't get there?

00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:34,834
Great question, and we're
so glad you brought it up

00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:36,602
because that's one of the things
that we think

00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,371
can make our company
really valuable.

00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:39,639
This is, first of all,
a problem

00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:42,308
that the entire fashion
and e‐commerce industry

00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:43,709
is working on to make sure

00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,379
that they can get the fit right
the first time

00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:48,281
and reduce
the return percentage rate.

00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,715
But, Andrew,
what problem am I solving?

00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:51,784
Because you said
at the beginning...
Yep.

00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,420
...you're saving the fee
to send my own bag.

00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,756
What's an av‐‐
You're also making
your trip better.

00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:59,492
I'm on the trip for five days.
That's $100.

00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:02,862
If I'm spending more than two
days, I'm not saving any money.

00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:05,398
You are saving money when
you get into the clothes
that are in the box.

00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:06,365
You already own
a lot of clothes.

00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:07,500
But you say you don't have
to take anything.

00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,468
Look at Kevin O'Leary.
Yeah.

00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,635
He would have
to take his shoes,

00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,504
he would have to take
deodorant and stuff,

00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:13,573
his ‐‐ his ‐‐ pack his teeth.
Yeah.

00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:14,774
He has a whole lot of things

00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:16,576
that he's gonna need
in this bag, right?
Yeah.

00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:17,677
‐Pack his what?
‐Teeth.

00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:19,045
You don't eliminate the fact
of not having bags.

00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:22,448
Liskov: This is why
it's important that we
target the customer,

00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,550
and this is one of the things
that we benefited

00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,587
from the six months that we've
been working on this full time,

00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,455
is that we learned about
who is gonna use this.
Greiner: Okay.

00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:30,456
So, you've only done this
for six months?

00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:31,657
Kevin O'Leary
is not gonna use ‐‐

00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,526
‐Why wouldn't I use it?
‐So, do you have sales, and ‐‐

00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,628
We do. Right now,
we've had 40 bookings,

00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:37,530
and we've had
38 people use unPack.

00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,764
And what are
your reviews like?
Yeah, baby!

00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,700
‐No, seriously.
‐You've made ‐‐

00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,902
You've made
hundreds of dollars.
Flex pump. Let's do the flex
for that.

00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:44,670
You've made
hundreds of dollars.
Liskov: Better than 37.

00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,405
No, no.
They've made <i>tens</i> of dollars.

00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:48,040
So, yes, our ability
to serve customers

00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,708
is limited in the beginning,

00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,409
and that's why we're looking
for capital,

00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:51,644
but the market potential here
is huge.

00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:54,514
The problem is,
you're brand‐new.
Mm‐hmm.

00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,649
And you're competing
in two very large markets.

00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,551
You're competing
for the consumer

00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:00,586
that wants to curate clothes.

00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:01,921
That's one market.

00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:05,691
The other market of saving me
money by checking my bag in ‐‐

00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,527
That's
a whole different problem,

00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,529
because you're not really
saving people money.

00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,964
It's not about the savings.

00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,467
Okay, so it's not
about the savings.
It's about solving ‐‐

00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:16,435
It's about the solving
the inconvenience of ‐‐

00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:17,570
But you're solving
the wrong problem, guys.

00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,105
‐Right.
‐That's the problem.

00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:19,605
Greiner: Right.

00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,407
So, first of all,
your name sucks,

00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,609
because it suggests that
you're competing with people

00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,344
that package and ship
for you.

00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:26,679
That's what I thought
and I think everybody else

00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:28,147
thought you were doing,
as well, right?

00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:29,248
‐Yeah.
‐Okay.

00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,550
Now, put that aside.

00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,786
What you could do that
would be far better in my mind,

00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:35,655
and you ‐‐ It would
save people money, go ‐‐

00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:37,557
Are you gonna reinvent
their business plan?

00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:38,758
Always.
That's what I always do.

00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:41,160
That's so important.
Going to Vegas, right?

00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,528
Not unPack ‐‐ FunPack.

00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:45,364
If I ‐‐ If I can go
to your website, pick Vegas,

00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:47,600
click on "club,"
and there's three looks.

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,237
Yeah.
And I pick one of those looks,
and it just shows up.

00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,572
Yep.
That's cool.

00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,674
That's exactly the company
we want to create.
That's the product.

00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:57,677
We ‐‐ We are ‐‐ We are going
in that direction,

00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:58,778
and that requires
an overhaul

00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:00,546
of the look and feel,
so right now ‐‐

00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:03,282
You're asking for $500,000

00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:04,617
for us
to redo everything with you.

00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:07,753
Not to redo everything.
We're optimizing.

00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,823
Aaron, tell us in one sentence
what your business is.

00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,359
We curate and deliver luggage
so you don't have to pack.

00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,460
‐No.
‐Luggage.

00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,628
No. Luggage.
You know what?
That's wrong.

00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,396
‐That's not your business.
‐That's not your business.

00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:18,497
I'm gonna tell you
your business.

00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:19,632
Their business is,
"We don't know what the hell

00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:20,666
we're talking about."
No.

00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,469
"We rent you fun clothes
for any trip for $20

00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,605
so you don't have
to buy them."

00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,740
You guys don't know
what business you're in.

00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,875
You don't know
how you're gonna get there.

00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,645
The ‐‐ What you're trying
to sell you're delusional about

00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:35,281
'cause it has nothing to do
with luggage and packing.

00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,550
You guys are confused.
I'm out.

00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,453
Thanks ‐‐
Thanks for your time.

00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,555
This business is synchronized

00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:45,725
to the trend
in the airline industry...

00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:47,560
No.
... to micro‐monetize
every aspect of the experience.

00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,761
Aaron, the ‐‐ the more
you guys talk ‐‐

00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:50,663
Oh, God.
... the more things
you explain,

00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:51,831
the more layers
you add to it ‐‐

00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53,232
That just empowers
the value proposition.
Those are ‐‐

00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,500
Those are ‐‐ Those are
the rational aspects of it.

00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,668
I don't like
the business idea.

00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:58,437
I don't think people
are gonna wear used clothes.

00:18:58,437 --> 00:18:59,939
I'm out.

00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:03,609
O'Leary: Guys, I'm always
an optimist, you know?

00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,511
Even when the presentation
is horrendous,

00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:06,779
as this one has been.

00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:09,615
I'm always looking
for that gem of upside.

00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,617
I needed to understand
the business model

00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:12,818
right out of the gate
early on

00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,588
because it's just
opportunistic at this point.

00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:17,723
And if you had been
much better at doing that,

00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:20,559
maybe, <i>maybe</i> you'd get
a deal here today,

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,062
but things aren't going well.

00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,197
I'm out.

00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:27,700
I have absolutely no problem

00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,702
with the ‐‐ the amount
of people you sold to

00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:32,638
because then it wouldn't be
a great opportunity, right?

00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,473
I have
a tuxedo‐rental company.

00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,242
You know
what the biggest issue we have?

00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:37,410
Cleaning.

00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,477
Mm‐hmm.
Right.

00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,513
We have a warehouse
a million square feet,

00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,683
and we can only basically rent
a tuxedo 12 times

00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,518
before we have
to throw it away.

00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,487
But you still don't
take away the luggage issue.

00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:51,824
Many of the travelers are
going to need to bring things

00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:53,659
that are very personal
to them.
Mm‐hmm.

00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,361
I can't take this ride
with you.

00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,896
I'm out.

00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,765
This is a new concept.

00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,767
It's experimental,
and that's why we think

00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,602
that it has
a lot of potential.

00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:06,238
People said the same thing about
bottled water 30 years ago.

00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:07,373
Oh, my God.

00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:08,774
You guys,
you have to really stop

00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:10,810
and look at,
what is this business?
Mm‐hmm.

00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:14,480
There are so many pieces to this
that I'm sorry to say it,

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,883
but I see it as a complete
and total nightmare.

00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,053
I'm out.

00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,291
Time to go packing.

00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:28,527
‐That was brutal.
‐[ Groans ]

00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,830
I think it's easy to walk out
of a situation like that

00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,399
and say, "Oh, man, well,
this is a losing battle,"

00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,567
but this is a new idea,

00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:35,735
and people don't know
what it looks like

It hasn't been done yet.

Narrator: Back in season five,
Melissa and Rick Hinnant

00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:44,643
made a deal
with Barbara Corcoran

00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:47,379
for their fashion sock company
Grace &amp; Lace.

00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:49,348
You picked the smartest person
here. Good for you.

00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:50,683
Let's see
what they're up to now.

00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:53,486
Melissa: Today is a huge day
for Grace &amp; Lace.

00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:55,387
We're finally
in our new facility,

00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:58,457
and Barbara arrives
to welcome our first intern.

00:20:58,457 --> 00:20:59,458
Rick, Melissa.

00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,626
Hey!
Hi!

00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:03,229
Rick: Before "Shark Tank," we
did a little over $1 million.

00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:03,763
It's been three years,

00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,766
and we've just crossed
$19 million in sales.

00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,602
We had six employees.
Now we have 47.

00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,704
$19 million in sales
allowed us

00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:14,607
to do the charitable work
that our hearts desire.

00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:17,376
We've been able to open
seven orphanages in India,

00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:19,645
and we have plans to open
schools in India and Nepal

00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:22,181
to give these kids
a very bright future.

00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:24,283
‐There she is.
‐Hey!

00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,652
We're welcoming Kendall,
our first intern.

00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:28,821
She's gonna be our ambassador
to our schools in India,

00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:30,790
where they are being taught
a skilled trade,

00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,125
which gives them a chance
at a career path.

00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,527
Well, I think we have
a lot of work to do.

00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:35,628
What do you say?

00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:38,330
The new internship program
is just another way

00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,698
that Grace &amp; Lace
is gonna give back.

00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:42,668
They're taking young girls
with an interest in design,

00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:45,638
and they're gonna teach them how
to make a living in this field.

00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,773
Hi, Susanna.
How are you?

00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:50,509
Corcoran: I've been making so
much money on this investment,

00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,378
but the satisfaction now

00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:54,647
is seeing
how much good they're doing.

00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,515
So, I heard
you're interested in fashion.

00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,651
Never in a million years
did I think that knitting

00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,587
would turn into a global brand
of women's apparel.

00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:03,289
Now we're growing
our business,

00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:04,790
we're rescuing orphans
overseas,

00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,659
and we're growing
our own family.

00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,495
We have three beautiful kids
that just mean the world to us,

00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:12,164
and we couldn't have done it
without "Shark Tank."

00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,233
Together: Grace &amp; Lace!

Narrator:
Next into the Tank is a product

00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,775
to ensure
you and your loved ones

00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:26,945
are always protected
from the sun.

00:22:34,452 --> 00:22:36,754
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Dave Cohen.

00:22:36,754 --> 00:22:39,624
I'm from Chapel Hill,
North Carolina.

00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:43,494
I'm the founder
and C. E. O. of Sunscreenr.

00:22:43,494 --> 00:22:46,698
I'm seeking an investment
of $800,000

00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,566
in exchange for 10% equity.

00:22:48,566 --> 00:22:51,469
‐Oh! Ooh.
‐Wow.

00:22:51,469 --> 00:22:53,738
Cohen:
Every year in the United States,

00:22:53,738 --> 00:22:58,543
we spend $1.3 billion
on sunscreen.

00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:02,280
Yet there are
still over 3 million new cases

00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,648
of skin cancer every year.

00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:06,751
And sunscreen,
it's our best line of defense

00:23:06,751 --> 00:23:08,786
against the dangers
of U. V. rays.

00:23:08,786 --> 00:23:13,458
However, you can't see if it's
actually protecting you...

00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,660
until now.

00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:21,666
Sunscreenr literally makes
the invisible visible.

00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:24,035
Sunscreenr is a special viewer

00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:28,673
that uses technology previously
accessible only to scientists

00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:32,744
to allow you to see the areas
of your skin that are protected

00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,545
and the areas that are not.

00:23:34,545 --> 00:23:37,382
When you look through
Sunscreenr,

00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:39,784
protected areas appear dark.

00:23:39,784 --> 00:23:42,587
Unprotected areas appear light.

00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:45,656
You can actually see the spots

00:23:45,656 --> 00:23:50,728
where water, sand, or sweat
have worn away your protection.

00:23:50,728 --> 00:23:54,499
So, whether you just want
a quick look at your kid's skin,

00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:56,601
or you want to check
your own protection,

00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,470
Sunscreenr has you covered.

00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:03,541
Lori,
I'd like to invite you up

00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:06,878
to have our Sunscreenr prototype
in action.

00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:10,748
We have a U. V. lamp here
which simulates the sun.

00:24:10,748 --> 00:24:13,484
You should probably wear
some sunglasses.

00:24:13,484 --> 00:24:14,652
Okay.

00:24:14,652 --> 00:24:16,687
This is the prototype.

00:24:16,687 --> 00:24:20,358
And you can see right here.
There's Lori's hand.

00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:21,626
So, what I'd like you to do

00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:25,296
is just put a streak of
sunscreen on your hand there...

00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:28,733
... and tilt it
toward the camera,

00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:30,601
and you can actually see it.

00:24:30,601 --> 00:24:33,237
And that's what it's going
to look like when you do it?

00:24:33,237 --> 00:24:34,405
‐I can see it.
‐You can?

00:24:34,405 --> 00:24:35,406
And you look through.

00:24:35,406 --> 00:24:36,541
I can see it.
Okay, we good?

00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,443
Anybody else want
to come up for a live demo?

00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:39,610
Yes. Why don't we try it
on black canvas?

00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:40,645
‐Yeah, I want to try it.
‐Sure.

00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:43,915
A black canvas.
Interesting.

00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,218
There you go.

00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:50,588
‐Oh, I can.
‐It turns white.

00:24:50,588 --> 00:24:52,657
That's really interesting.
So, on me, it turns black...

00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:53,891
I'm a white man now!

00:24:53,891 --> 00:24:56,794
[ Laughter ]
... and on him, it turns white.

00:24:56,794 --> 00:24:59,664
So, what you're seeing is
the shininess of the sunscreen.

00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:02,633
Sunscreen's job
is to protect your skin,

00:25:02,633 --> 00:25:06,571
and it does that
by absorbing the U. V. rays.

00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:09,574
So this is set up
to detect U. V.

00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:12,977
It throws out all of the
visible, all of the infrared,

00:25:12,977 --> 00:25:17,448
and only shows you the areas
where sunscreen absorbs.

00:25:17,448 --> 00:25:18,683
All right, I have a question.
Sure.

00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,652
So, in the video,
it was very clear to see...

00:25:21,652 --> 00:25:22,820
Right.
... how it worked.

00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,556
When we came up there,
it was very black and white

00:25:25,556 --> 00:25:27,558
and kind of grainy
and a little bit harder to see.

00:25:27,558 --> 00:25:29,560
So, for one,
that was the video

00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,629
that goes along
with our Kickstarter campaign,

00:25:31,629 --> 00:25:34,866
and it was also outside where
there's a ton more U. V. light.

00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,934
Dave, how much was
your Kickstarter campaign?

00:25:36,934 --> 00:25:41,439
So far, in five weeks,
we've raised $93,000.

00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:43,107
O'Leary:
What was your target?

00:25:43,107 --> 00:25:44,442
$45,000.

00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:45,943
Are you shipping
the finished product yet?

00:25:45,943 --> 00:25:50,181
No. We will be shipping the
finished product in December.

00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:52,049
Ohh.

00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:55,553
So, technically,
this is your viewer?

00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:56,687
That's right.

00:25:56,687 --> 00:26:00,625
So, it is solely, like, a
monocle or a magnifying glass

00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:03,728
to look at your body
or your child's body

00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:06,330
to say, where is sunscreen,
where isn't it?

00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:07,465
That's exactly right.

00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:09,901
So, I have a PhD in biochemistry
and biophysics.

00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:14,472
I've spent most of my career
building medical devices,

00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:17,308
as well as devices
for the Defense Department

00:26:17,308 --> 00:26:18,743
and for forensic use.

00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,411
‐Ooh.
‐Now, you're credible.

00:26:20,411 --> 00:26:21,412
I got it.

00:26:21,412 --> 00:26:23,447
Why is it worth
$8 million <i>today?</i>

00:26:23,447 --> 00:26:24,615
Cohen: Today.
Ooh.

00:26:24,615 --> 00:26:27,885
Five weeks after going public
with this thing,

00:26:27,885 --> 00:26:31,455
I've already sold 1,200 of these
on Kickstarter.

00:26:31,455 --> 00:26:34,859
1,200, though, is not ‐‐
is not a huge amount.

00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:38,029
$90,000, which is a run rate
of nearly $1 million a year.

00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:39,330
‐But how do you get to ‐‐
‐Oh, come on!

00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,865
Now you're getting into the ‐‐
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh!

00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:42,366
You can't do that.
You can't do that.

00:26:42,366 --> 00:26:43,467
‐Okay, but, Dave ‐‐
‐You know that.

00:26:43,467 --> 00:26:44,802
‐You're brilliant.
‐Dave, if you're a PhD,

00:26:44,802 --> 00:26:46,804
you know
you can't extrapolate that.

00:26:46,804 --> 00:26:48,873
What price point
are you gonna sell them at?

00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:52,777
So, right now, the list price
on Kickstarter is $109.

00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,779
What does it cost you
to make?

00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:58,916
In the lowest quantity,
it costs us $45 each to make.

00:26:58,916 --> 00:27:02,386
Dave, who told you to put
a value of $8 million on it?

00:27:02,386 --> 00:27:03,521
That's the question,
'cause I ‐‐

00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:04,722
But, Dave, are you ‐‐
Dave, seriously. Who put...

00:27:04,722 --> 00:27:06,624
Dave, I think we're all
struggling with the valuation.

00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,792
Cohen:
So, within the first few weeks

00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:08,960
of launching the Kickstarter,

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,464
we were contacted by five
different sunscreen companies,

00:27:13,464 --> 00:27:15,700
two of which are
multi‐billion‐dollar

00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,468
global companies...
Okay.

00:27:17,468 --> 00:27:20,238
...interested
in partnering with us.

00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:21,639
Licensing the technology

00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:23,207
or selling your product
with their sunscreen?

00:27:23,207 --> 00:27:25,776
So far, we're in very early
discussions with all of them.
So, Dave...

00:27:25,776 --> 00:27:27,812
what does interest mean?
In part, we were holding them
all off

00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,915
until we had this opportunity
to present it to you guys.

00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:34,619
Cuban: Dave, let's just say
I'm hanging with my three kids

00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:37,388
and I make
the perfect application...

00:27:37,388 --> 00:27:38,723
Mm‐hmm.
... of sunscreen.

00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:42,226
Of all the sunscreen
applications ever,

00:27:42,226 --> 00:27:43,261
this was the best.

00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:44,462
Okay.
Okay?

00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:45,830
How long does that last?

00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,898
30 minutes if they're ‐‐
if they're in the water,

00:27:47,898 --> 00:27:49,800
jumping in and out of the water
every 30 minutes?

00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,669
If you want
to protect them properly.

00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:54,438
You're only gonna use this
if you're diligent, right?
Right.

00:27:54,438 --> 00:27:55,606
Right, so you have
to have the discipline

00:27:55,606 --> 00:27:56,707
to do it in the first place.

00:27:56,707 --> 00:27:58,709
Or every time your child
comes out of the water,

00:27:58,709 --> 00:28:00,678
you bring out Sunscreenr,
have a quick look.

00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:02,680
That's the problem.
You can't have a quick look.

00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,749
You can, because you hit
the power button.

00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:06,917
By the time it's up to your eye,
it's on, and you can see.

00:28:06,917 --> 00:28:08,753
But I've got to check ‐‐
You've got to turn them around,

00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:09,887
you've got to ‐‐
No, no, no, no.

00:28:09,887 --> 00:28:12,290
It has a wide field of view
like your cellphones.

00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,524
It's not a microscope.

00:28:13,524 --> 00:28:15,660
It acts like
a wide‐view camera.

00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:19,463
I just think you have sold
yourself so intently

00:28:19,463 --> 00:28:20,631
on the value of this,

00:28:20,631 --> 00:28:22,667
you've lost
all self‐awareness and context

00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,502
about the actual business.

00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:26,203
I'm out.

00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:30,374
Dave, I don't buy the premise
that people are gonna check

00:28:30,374 --> 00:28:31,642
every 30 minutes,
however long.

00:28:31,642 --> 00:28:34,645
You're telling me they are,
but you haven't validated it.

00:28:34,645 --> 00:28:40,618
Your PhD makes you
a credible scientist,

00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:43,654
but when you come out with
a $8 million valuation,

00:28:43,654 --> 00:28:46,490
you better have a PhD
in business,

00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:48,726
you better have a PhD
in customer research.

00:28:48,726 --> 00:28:50,661
You better have
a freakin' PhD

00:28:50,661 --> 00:28:53,431
in something
besides your own hype.

00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:55,199
I'm out.

00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:56,534
Thank you.

00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:59,837
I've listened to you, and
I understand the risks of it.

00:28:59,837 --> 00:29:02,606
But everybody has the same
problem with the valuation.

00:29:02,606 --> 00:29:04,442
It's not worth
$8 million today.

00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:05,676
Here's the deal
I propose to you.

00:29:05,676 --> 00:29:11,248
I'll give you the $800,000
for 33 1/3%.

00:29:11,248 --> 00:29:12,616
I appreciate that.

00:29:12,616 --> 00:29:14,618
The valuation, of course,
is way too much.

00:29:14,618 --> 00:29:17,355
I cannot sell a kidney
to be part of this company.

00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:18,356
[ Laughter ]
So...

00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:19,490
You wouldn't get $800,000.

00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:21,225
Yes, I would.

00:29:21,225 --> 00:29:22,360
I'm out.

00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,028
Thank you, Daymond.

00:29:24,795 --> 00:29:26,664
Your valuation ‐‐
If you had come in

00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:28,599
with something more reasonable
to me,

00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:30,334
I would be giving you
an offer.

00:29:30,334 --> 00:29:31,635
I wouldn't even think twice.

00:29:31,635 --> 00:29:33,270
But I think that your ‐‐

00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,638
What's a reasonable valuation?

00:29:34,638 --> 00:29:37,675
What would ‐‐
What would make sense to you

00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:39,510
given your experience?

00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:42,313
Listen, Dave,
you're a smart guy.

00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:43,681
Show <i>me.</i>
What offer?

00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:45,616
Give <i>me</i> an offer.

00:29:45,616 --> 00:29:47,518
Tell me what you want
to hear from me.

00:29:47,518 --> 00:29:52,189
Would you go $800,000 for 20%?

00:29:52,189 --> 00:29:54,425
No. I wouldn't.

00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:57,595
Okay,
so, you have one offer.

00:29:57,595 --> 00:30:00,531
I'll give you $800,000
for 33 1/3%.

00:30:00,531 --> 00:30:02,133
What are you gonna do?

00:30:03,467 --> 00:30:06,070
Are you gonna counter back,
Lori?

00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:13,577
There is nothing tangible here
for me to really understand

00:30:13,577 --> 00:30:16,814
if the consumer
is going to buy into...

00:30:16,814 --> 00:30:19,550
‐Are you in?
‐... using this.

00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,485
I'm sorry.
I'm out.

00:30:21,485 --> 00:30:22,553
‐All right. Thank you.
‐Wow.

00:30:22,553 --> 00:30:23,621
Herjavec: Dave,
you're left with one offer.

00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:25,489
‐I'm left with Kevin.
‐Okay, so, Dave...

00:30:25,489 --> 00:30:29,160
Kevin's only offered
$800,000 for 1/3.

00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,594
Would you do 25%?

00:30:30,594 --> 00:30:34,331
No.
That's a lot of money, Dave.

00:30:34,331 --> 00:30:37,401
$800,000 for 33 1/3%.

00:30:37,401 --> 00:30:39,370
It's the only offer
you have.

00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:40,938
What are you gonna do?

00:30:49,313 --> 00:30:50,481
We have a deal.

00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:52,450
Oh!

00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,051
What?!

00:30:55,152 --> 00:30:56,220
You got it.

00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,421
Thank you.

00:30:57,421 --> 00:30:59,089
Good luck, Dave.

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,628
Kevin's a good negotiator,

00:31:04,628 --> 00:31:06,630
and ‐‐ and since he was
the last Shark, you know,

00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:08,699
I didn't want
to lose the opportunity

00:31:08,699 --> 00:31:12,903
to have a Shark
as part of our team.

00:31:17,808 --> 00:31:20,777
Narrator: Next into the Tank
is a business

00:31:20,777 --> 00:31:25,015
that delivers an unusual twist
to a common product.

00:31:26,583 --> 00:31:28,385
[ Laughs ]

00:31:34,658 --> 00:31:38,262
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Alex Craig.

00:31:38,262 --> 00:31:38,795
And I'm Riad Bekhit.

00:31:38,795 --> 00:31:41,632
Our company
is seeking $50,000

00:31:41,632 --> 00:31:44,368
in exchange for 10% equity
in our business.

00:31:44,368 --> 00:31:46,837
Look, Sharks,
over the years,

00:31:46,837 --> 00:31:50,607
you've heard all types
of elaborate, intricate,

00:31:50,607 --> 00:31:52,876
and over‐the‐top pitches.

00:31:52,876 --> 00:31:54,878
Well, we're here
to keep it simple,

00:31:54,878 --> 00:31:57,447
so let's take this pitch
back to our roots.

00:31:57,447 --> 00:32:00,551
Sharks, our company
is Potato Parcel,

00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:05,355
and we mail potatoes,
and that's it.

00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:08,559
Any questions?

00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,562
Maybe too simple.
Explain it again.

00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:14,364
So, Potato Parcel
is a brand‐new way

00:32:14,364 --> 00:32:15,732
of sending anyone you know

00:32:15,732 --> 00:32:18,802
a custom message
written on a potato.

00:32:18,802 --> 00:32:21,672
It's just stupid on a stick,
right?

00:32:21,672 --> 00:32:22,906
It's ‐‐ It's actually stupid
on a <i>potato.</i>

00:32:22,906 --> 00:32:24,641
Stupid on a potato. Exactly.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:32:24,641 --> 00:32:26,510
This is a potato company?
Yes, it's a potato.

00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:29,279
Oh, I thought the outfit
was a pair of testicles.

00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,447
[ Laughter ]

00:32:30,447 --> 00:32:31,882
‐Potatoes.
‐Oh, my.

00:32:31,882 --> 00:32:33,517
Get closer together
for one second.

00:32:33,517 --> 00:32:35,419
[ Laughter ]
Oh, no.

00:32:35,419 --> 00:32:36,887
You're right!
You're right!

00:32:36,887 --> 00:32:38,722
‐Oh, my God.
‐As soon as they're...

00:32:38,722 --> 00:32:39,856
It's the same thing
every morning!

00:32:39,856 --> 00:32:41,592
‐It's the same thing.
‐Lord.

00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:42,793
O'Leary: Let's walk through
the business model.

00:32:42,793 --> 00:32:44,494
I want to send somebody
a message.

00:32:44,494 --> 00:32:46,597
You're gonna write
on a potato for me?

00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:48,599
Yes.
So, how much does it cost me
to do that?

00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,500
Wait a minute.
We need our samples.

00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,602
‐Let's start with the samples.
‐Absolutely.

00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:52,669
Greiner: Like, how are
we talking about something

00:32:52,669 --> 00:32:53,804
when we don't even know
what it looks like?

00:32:53,804 --> 00:32:54,972
‐Cool.
‐Does it come in a box?

00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:57,774
It comes in a bubbled envelope
and special packaging

00:32:57,774 --> 00:32:58,909
that we're gonna include
right here for you guys.

00:32:58,909 --> 00:33:00,711
‐Robert, this one's for you.
‐Thank you.

00:33:00,711 --> 00:33:01,878
Oh, it comes like this.
‐Lori.

00:33:01,878 --> 00:33:04,381
Lori, we have a special one.
‐I get the sweet potato.

00:33:04,381 --> 00:33:05,515
Oh!
‐The sweet potato.

00:33:05,515 --> 00:33:06,583
‐Kevin.
‐Kevin.

00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:08,719
‐Daymond.
‐Thank you.

00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:09,953
‐And Mark.
‐What's it say on yours?

00:33:09,953 --> 00:33:13,590
It says, "Lori, would you be
my sweet potato?"
All right.

00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,758
‐Aww.
‐Aww.

00:33:14,758 --> 00:33:16,727
‐Mine has a picture of me.
‐Lori.

00:33:16,727 --> 00:33:17,928
Mine's a very handsome potato.

00:33:17,928 --> 00:33:20,497
And mine says, "There's nothing
proprietary about this."

00:33:20,497 --> 00:33:21,698
‐How true.
‐And I think ‐‐

00:33:21,698 --> 00:33:23,433
And I think
this potato is right.
We knew you'd love it.

00:33:23,433 --> 00:33:24,635
This potato's
absolutely right.

00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:27,270
So, gentlemen,
what happened to your careers?

00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:27,804
What went wrong?

00:33:27,804 --> 00:33:30,474
How, Alex?
How did you come up with this?

00:33:30,474 --> 00:33:31,708
Yeah, I was on Reddit,

00:33:31,708 --> 00:33:35,445
and the top post of the day
was a potato with stamps on it,

00:33:35,445 --> 00:33:37,581
and I thought
that was a really funny idea

00:33:37,581 --> 00:33:38,849
that you could mail someone
a potato.

00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:41,685
1.5 million people saw
a potato with stamps on it,

00:33:41,685 --> 00:33:42,819
and I just saw
an opportunity.

00:33:42,819 --> 00:33:45,656
Did anybody
buy the potato message?

00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:48,058
To date, we've sold
over 12,000 potatoes

00:33:48,058 --> 00:33:52,396
and put over 12,000 smiles
and expressions of confusion

00:33:52,396 --> 00:33:53,430
on people's faces.

00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,464
[ Laughter ]

00:33:54,464 --> 00:33:55,699
What are your costs?

00:33:55,699 --> 00:33:58,702
So, the Potato Parcel with just
the message on it is $9.99.

00:33:58,702 --> 00:34:00,804
The one you have,
Mark and Robert...
[ Chuckling ] No.

00:34:00,804 --> 00:34:01,938
...the Potato Pal ‐‐
How much is...

00:34:01,938 --> 00:34:03,774
‐Is this a Potato Pal?
‐That's a Potato Pal.

00:34:03,774 --> 00:34:05,375
‐That's a Potato Pal.
‐Aww.

00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:06,643
Bekhit: So, that's $14.99.

00:34:06,643 --> 00:34:09,813
And we also have the Potato
Postcard, which is $12.99.

00:34:09,813 --> 00:34:11,682
‐Why is this one so much more?
‐Can you just mail the potato

00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:12,749
with a stamp on it?
‐So...

00:34:12,749 --> 00:34:14,484
Or do you actually have
to put it in a box?

00:34:14,484 --> 00:34:15,652
So, actually,
when I started the business,

00:34:15,652 --> 00:34:16,853
I showed up
to the post office

00:34:16,853 --> 00:34:18,088
with a potato
with stamps on it.

00:34:18,088 --> 00:34:20,791
I said, "Hey, can I mail this?"
and they said, "Absolutely.

00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:21,858
We can mail that for you."
No, they can't.

00:34:21,858 --> 00:34:23,460
And I said, "Great.
I have 500 of them."

00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,661
It's automated.
And then they said,

00:34:24,661 --> 00:34:26,496
"You can't mail
that many potatoes."

00:34:26,496 --> 00:34:27,898
So we actually now put it
in an envelope

00:34:27,898 --> 00:34:29,466
as a means
for surprise and delight.

00:34:29,466 --> 00:34:30,667
Bekhit: And, guys, we want

00:34:30,667 --> 00:34:31,735
to show you
some of our other products.
Yeah.

00:34:31,735 --> 00:34:33,603
‐Oh, you have more?
‐Great.

00:34:33,603 --> 00:34:35,806
Bekhit: So, we're very seasonal
at Potato Parcel,

there was a contingency.

00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,809
Since he was in touch
with "Shark Tank,"

00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:22,879
the contingency
was that if we got on the show,

he would be entitled
to $1 per potato

00:41:45,735 --> 00:41:49,239
‐Mr. Potato!
‐Yes!

00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:50,240
Yes!
‐Wow.

00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:50,940
Thank you so much.

00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,609
I'm really looking forward
to working with your company.

00:41:52,609 --> 00:41:53,910
‐Oh, man.
‐This is absolutely terrific.

00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:55,545
Greiner: You look like
a potato with them.
Give them a big hug.

00:41:55,545 --> 00:41:57,480
Kevin, give them a big hug.
Go back up there.

00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:01,184
‐Aah!
‐Aah!

00:42:01,918 --> 00:42:03,753
Cuban: Riad, Riad,
just got to ask you.
John: That is horrible!

00:42:03,753 --> 00:42:05,622
Have you always
had this delivery,

00:42:05,622 --> 00:42:08,291
or do you, like, copy
Jimmy Kimmel on purpose?

00:42:08,291 --> 00:42:09,626
Oh, no, I just felt that.

00:42:09,626 --> 00:42:10,827
That's great.
Thank you, guys.

00:42:10,827 --> 00:42:12,328
‐Good luck.
‐All right.

00:42:12,328 --> 00:42:14,464
‐Dude.
‐Yes!

00:42:14,464 --> 00:42:15,732
Bekhit: I can't believe
we got a deal.

00:42:15,732 --> 00:42:18,635
I can't believe the company's
been growing this much,

00:42:18,635 --> 00:42:21,271
and I‐I really can't wait
to see what's gonna happen

00:42:21,271 --> 00:42:21,871
with this business.

00:42:21,871 --> 00:42:25,175
We're really gonna take over
the world of potatoes.

00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:26,276
I really believe it.
