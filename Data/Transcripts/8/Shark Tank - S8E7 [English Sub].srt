00:26:48,162 --> 00:26:50,164
and we said, you know,
we were some smart people.

00:26:50,164 --> 00:26:51,966
Let's ‐‐ "We can try
to chase this down

00:26:51,966 --> 00:26:53,100
and solve this problem."

00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,036
So we took this technology
and we invented it.

00:26:55,036 --> 00:26:56,203
And being super‐green
and naive,

00:26:56,203 --> 00:26:58,239
we said, "Hey, we're just
gonna take it to the market,

00:26:58,239 --> 00:27:00,007
and they're just gonna adopt,"
right?

00:27:00,007 --> 00:27:01,175
But we kept getting blocked

00:27:01,175 --> 00:27:03,077
by those in
the seafood‐supply chain.

00:27:03,077 --> 00:27:05,980
And we probably chased
that business strategy

00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,048
longer than
we should have.

00:27:07,048 --> 00:27:08,115
How long?

00:27:08,115 --> 00:27:09,116
About 10 years.

10 years ago?

period of time?

go to?

It took four PhD physicists,
we had three engineering labs ‐‐

the investors got tired,

ran out of money,

they couldn't get
into retailers.

00:27:31,105 --> 00:27:34,108

and we bought the company out.

Less than $1 million.
Okay.

00:27:36,377 --> 00:27:38,045
The $14 million
got wiped out?

00:27:38,045 --> 00:27:39,814

‐Yes, they're gone.

00:27:39,814 --> 00:27:41,182

raised after that?

00:27:43,284 --> 00:27:45,419
Yes.
I put in over $900,000...

00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:47,154

00:27:47,154 --> 00:27:51,892

Tell us a little bit
about your background.

00:34:54,081 --> 00:34:55,549
So, back in 2009,

00:34:55,549 --> 00:34:58,519
I was seven years into my role
at Procter &amp; Gamble,

00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:00,287
the largest consumer‐products
company in the world.

00:35:00,287 --> 00:35:02,923
I was leading social marketing
for a lot of our bigger brands,

00:35:02,923 --> 00:35:03,590
like Tide and Old Spice.

00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:06,260
And I just turned 30,
I was going through a breakup,

00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:09,429
and I was trying to figure out
what my purpose was in life.

00:35:09,429 --> 00:35:11,198
And that's when I first
started to realize is,

00:35:11,198 --> 00:35:13,066
sooner you start to focus
your mind and your heart

00:35:13,066 --> 00:35:15,102
and your spirit and your soul
on your passions,

00:35:15,102 --> 00:35:17,171
the universe starts to open up
doors and unlock windows

00:35:17,171 --> 00:35:18,305
you never thought possible.

00:35:18,305 --> 00:35:20,440
And I started to learn
the power of this word,

00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,277
because it's intuitive and
instantly personal to people.

00:35:23,277 --> 00:35:25,445
When people around the world
hear "be somebody,"

00:35:25,445 --> 00:35:27,447
it becomes about <i>you</i>
and what <i>you</i> love.

00:35:27,447 --> 00:35:29,449
It becomes about
your personal passion,

00:35:29,449 --> 00:35:32,186
whether it's photography,
or car racing, or fashion.

00:35:32,186 --> 00:35:34,054
That's what's powerful
about it.

00:35:34,054 --> 00:35:35,322
And as soon as I started
to really see

00:35:35,322 --> 00:35:36,924
that there was
something there,

00:35:36,924 --> 00:35:38,392

that happiness

how fast you can

I was the first person
in history

00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,028
to trademark a hash,
back in 2011.
But even
if you trademark it,

00:36:48,028 --> 00:36:49,363
you just put in a hashtag
and "be," it'll pop up,

00:36:49,363 --> 00:36:50,497
and someone
could still click on it.

and do an activity we like,

00:37:05,145 --> 00:37:06,179
like white‐water rafting,

00:37:06,179 --> 00:37:08,148

a training platform

the potential litigation was,

00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,078
you're raising capital.

00:38:11,078 --> 00:38:13,046

Okay, so ‐‐

partnerships, when we scale,

00:38:21,455 --> 00:38:23,790
the reason why
they're partnering with us ‐‐

00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:24,458
there's three reasons.

00:38:24,458 --> 00:38:26,159
One, because they believe
in the mission.

00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:27,294
You heard Kristine Lilly.

00:38:27,294 --> 00:38:29,062
Two, because they have
a shared goal of education.

00:38:29,062 --> 00:38:30,263
But you don't have
any traffic yet.

00:38:30,263 --> 00:38:31,298
Why would she give you
exclusivity

00:38:31,298 --> 00:38:32,399
when you have nobody
on this thing?

00:38:32,399 --> 00:38:35,001
Because you probably had
to qualify the exclusivity

00:38:35,001 --> 00:38:36,269
to an app
or something specific,

00:38:36,269 --> 00:38:38,171

any minimums?

00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,347
No, we didn't.
We didn't.

00:38:47,347 --> 00:38:48,281
Corcoran:
Kash, you have ‐‐

00:38:48,281 --> 00:38:49,182
But you got
to understand ‐‐

00:38:49,182 --> 00:38:50,784
Kash.
Time out.

00:38:50,784 --> 00:38:51,952
Kash!
Yoo‐hoo!

00:38:51,952 --> 00:38:53,019
Yoo‐hoo.
She's gonna starve!

00:38:53,019 --> 00:38:54,187
She's begging for ‐‐
No, Mark ‐‐ Mark, no,

00:38:54,187 --> 00:38:55,989
because, Mark, she ‐‐

00:38:55,989 --> 00:38:56,990
He's running out
of cash.

00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,058
Kash!
Kash!

00:38:58,058 --> 00:38:59,926
One sec. One second,
just to finish with Mark.

00:38:59,926 --> 00:39:01,161
No, focus here a second,
Kash.

00:39:01,161 --> 00:39:03,230
Mark, we become payment platform
and tool for them.

00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,264
But I think that, guys,

00:39:04,264 --> 00:39:06,366
what's the most important
part about this

00:39:06,366 --> 00:39:08,435
is people believe
in what we stand for.

00:39:08,435 --> 00:39:10,070
I'm gonna show you guys
one thing, real quick.

00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,104
Oh, my God.

00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,372
'Cause I think ‐‐
I think it's important.

00:39:12,372 --> 00:39:14,508
I‐I used to carry this around
back in 2011.

00:39:14,508 --> 00:39:17,110
A little 8x11 card
that I made myself...
Kash, you're killing us.

00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,211
... when I was going
around the world

00:39:18,211 --> 00:39:19,179
to try to inspire people.

00:39:19,179 --> 00:39:20,180
Kash, Kash,
you're killing us.

00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,782
Did you bring
a collection plate?

00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,228
Narrator:
All six Sharks are still in,

00:39:35,228 --> 00:39:38,198
but Mark has an issue with Kash
selling the passion

00:39:38,198 --> 00:39:41,134
more than the merits
of his business, #besomebody,

00:39:41,134 --> 00:39:43,303
a booking platform
for experiences.

00:39:43,303 --> 00:39:45,038
Cuban:
Kash, rule number one ‐‐

00:39:45,038 --> 00:39:46,606
the longer the back story,
the worse the deal.

00:39:46,606 --> 00:39:49,142
Well, let me tell you
about our business.
Rule number two ‐‐

00:39:49,142 --> 00:39:53,146
more preaching always equals
less money for the investor.

00:39:53,146 --> 00:39:55,081
For those two reasons,
I'm out.

00:39:55,081 --> 00:39:56,983
Right.

00:39:56,983 --> 00:40:01,221
I find you
enormously abrasive.

00:40:01,221 --> 00:40:02,622
You drive me nuts.

00:40:02,622 --> 00:40:05,358
I feel as though you don't have
the capacity to listen.

00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:08,161
Could you imagine
what kind of a partner

00:40:08,161 --> 00:40:09,896
you would make for me?

00:40:09,896 --> 00:40:11,665
I'm out.

00:40:12,933 --> 00:40:14,134
Right.

00:40:14,134 --> 00:40:16,169
Herjavec:
Kash, here's the beauty
of a social platform,

00:40:16,169 --> 00:40:17,337
here's the beauty
of a movement ‐‐

00:40:17,337 --> 00:40:20,207
a movement, by nature,
is viral.
Right.

00:40:20,207 --> 00:40:21,341
You're not getting
that growth.

00:40:21,341 --> 00:40:22,342
No, it's working in Austin.

00:40:22,342 --> 00:40:23,910
‐Maybe it's not working.
‐It's working.

00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:25,245
We don't
have Passionaries yet

00:40:25,245 --> 00:40:27,514
because we haven't ‐‐ we haven't
scaled our marketplace.

00:40:27,514 --> 00:40:31,084
You know, my BS ‐‐ I'm not
calling you out on this...
Right, right.

00:40:31,084 --> 00:40:33,320
...I'm just saying, my sense
for that always goes up.

00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,955
I don't understand
the business.

00:40:34,955 --> 00:40:35,822
Right.

00:40:35,822 --> 00:40:37,958
I mean, I'm out.

00:40:37,958 --> 00:40:39,259
Greiner:
I'm gonna jump in.

00:40:39,259 --> 00:40:41,428
So, there's so many
apps out there.

00:40:41,428 --> 00:40:44,197
It seems to me like
this is just not gonna be one

00:40:44,197 --> 00:40:45,765
that's gonna make it.

00:40:45,765 --> 00:40:48,201
I'm out.

00:40:48,201 --> 00:40:49,903
Kash, how much ‐‐ how much
of your own money

00:40:49,903 --> 00:40:50,737
do you have in this?

00:40:50,737 --> 00:40:51,304
$200,000.

00:40:51,304 --> 00:40:53,073
‐Wow.
‐$200,000. Are you ‐‐

00:40:53,073 --> 00:40:55,075
We are pioneering
experiential learning.

00:40:55,075 --> 00:40:56,176
No, you're not.

00:40:56,176 --> 00:40:58,411
Education is
a $4.1 trillion industry!

00:40:58,411 --> 00:41:00,247
Online learning is going
three times as fast!

00:41:00,247 --> 00:41:01,948
Preach, preach, preach,
preach, preach, preach.

00:41:01,948 --> 00:41:03,316
But, Mark, it's important.

00:41:03,316 --> 00:41:05,118
It's important, Mark.
Preach, preach, preach.

00:41:05,118 --> 00:41:06,152
I still never got over

00:41:06,152 --> 00:41:08,054
how you're going
to protect yourself

00:41:08,054 --> 00:41:09,089
against liabilities.

00:41:09,089 --> 00:41:10,290
I just think you're gonna have
a lot of people

00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:12,025
teaching
dangerous things,

00:41:12,025 --> 00:41:15,028
and one lawsuit can kill
the entire company.

00:41:15,028 --> 00:41:16,596
I'm out.

00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:20,066
Let's leave all the passion
and all the s‐‐

00:41:20,066 --> 00:41:21,134
The Kumbaya?

00:41:21,134 --> 00:41:22,369
Kumbay‐‐ leave it aside
for a second.

00:41:22,369 --> 00:41:25,171
In the end, "Shark Tank"
is about making money.

00:41:25,171 --> 00:41:26,506
We built a brand, Kevin.

00:41:26,506 --> 00:41:28,341
I'm gonna put ‐‐
You know what's gonna
screw you up, Kash?

00:41:28,341 --> 00:41:30,277
The fact that you're believing
your own nonsense.

00:41:30,277 --> 00:41:31,678
These are real ‐‐
this is real data.

00:41:31,678 --> 00:41:33,313
These are real numbers.
Sometimes,
you got to do the work.

00:41:33,313 --> 00:41:34,781
Just tweeting "be somebody"
doesn't get [bleep] done, bro!

00:41:34,781 --> 00:41:35,448
You got to do something.

00:41:35,448 --> 00:41:37,150
What do you think I've been
doing for three years?!

00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,218
Talking!
Talking, talking, talking.
No, we haven't.

00:41:38,218 --> 00:41:39,486
We built a community
from this.

00:41:39,486 --> 00:41:40,987
He's an instructor.
What do you think he does?

00:41:40,987 --> 00:41:42,222
We built
a passionate community.

00:41:42,222 --> 00:41:43,490
Go online,
just search "be somebody,"

00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:45,659
you're gonna get inspired by
all the stories that you hear!

00:41:45,659 --> 00:41:46,326
The people that are here,

00:41:46,326 --> 00:41:48,094
they're inspired
by the movement...

00:41:48,094 --> 00:41:49,229
O'Leary: Kash.
... to have an opportun‐‐

00:41:49,229 --> 00:41:51,197
Kash.
[ Scattered chuckles ]

00:41:51,197 --> 00:41:52,832
Silence, all right?
We're gonna own the experient‐‐

00:41:52,832 --> 00:41:54,901
I'm calling <i>you</i> out.

00:41:54,901 --> 00:41:56,903
In eight years of history,

00:41:56,903 --> 00:41:58,138
you're one
of the first people

00:41:58,138 --> 00:42:00,407
to ever have six shots
at this, okay?
Right, right.

00:42:00,407 --> 00:42:02,676
You struck out
on every one.
I appreciate it.

00:42:02,676 --> 00:42:04,878
Zero.

00:42:04,878 --> 00:42:06,012
I'm out.

00:42:06,012 --> 00:42:07,013
See ya, buddy.

00:42:07,013 --> 00:42:08,281
Go be somebody, bro.

00:42:08,281 --> 00:42:09,349
Greiner: Good luck.

00:42:09,349 --> 00:42:10,984
Hey, keep ‐‐ keep out ‐‐
watching out for us,

00:42:10,984 --> 00:42:11,885
you guys will see it.

00:42:11,885 --> 00:42:13,286
We will.
We sure will.

00:42:13,286 --> 00:42:14,487
Everybody's gonna say

00:42:14,487 --> 00:42:16,256
that they, you know,
heard about this one day

00:42:16,256 --> 00:42:18,058
and that they wish that
they were a part of it.

00:42:18,058 --> 00:42:20,260
So, you know,
the Sharks can keep investing

00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:22,495
in, like, sideshow Porta‐Pottis
and things like that.

00:42:22,495 --> 00:42:25,832
We're building a platform that's
gonna change the world.
