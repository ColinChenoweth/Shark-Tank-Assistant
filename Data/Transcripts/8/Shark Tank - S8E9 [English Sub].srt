as early as we can
during puppyhood.

we roll them over

So our customer acquisition

00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,626
really revolves around
social media and social sharing.

00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:22,529
Because they're puppies,
it's very shareable content.

So we have 75,000 followers

right there.

00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:50,363
‐Yeah, let's go there.
‐Straight in, straight in.

00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:51,631
‐Hold on, hold on, hold on.
‐Let's get the goods.

00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:53,366
Because I guarantee you
it's coming up.

00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,735
Yeah, yeah.

00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,271
Is this a lot of Lycra?

00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:00,473
Yeah, it's 1% spandex.

00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:01,741
All right, Kevin,
what was your question?

00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:03,576
Let's go right there.
‐My question is very simple.

00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:06,312
You better have a ton of sales
to justify this evaluation

00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:07,647
in the clothing industry.
‐Well, stop.

00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:09,349
I want to just
get to this really quick.

00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,450
Why can't we talk
about sales, Daymond?

00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,617
Because I like ‐‐
I want to be ab‐‐

00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,653
You don't have
a 32 inch waist!

00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:15,488
‐I want to be romanced.
‐Are you kidding me?

00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:17,156
‐Yeah.
‐Okay, let's ‐‐

00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:17,824
Kevin,
ask your question.

00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:21,027
Tell me what your sales
are gonna be this year.

00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,328
$2.3 million.

00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:23,496
‐$2.3 million?
‐Wow.

00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:25,331
‐Yes.
‐And you think

00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,733
you're worth
five times revenue?

00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:28,401
Cuban: That's not
the real question.

00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:30,536
The real question is,
what's your growth rate?

00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,505
Our growth rate
currently is around 100%.

00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:35,341
Per year, so you expect
to do $3.4 million

00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:36,442
give or take, next year?

00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:37,543
Yeah, $3 million
to $4 million.

00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,278
Where are the clothes
being sold?

00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:40,480
100% online.

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,814
Where have you
done these sales?

00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:45,485
So we founded on Kickstarter,
in, uh, March of 2014.

00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:49,722
And so, um, I married my wife
in spring of 2014,

00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,425
and because
the business was struggling,

00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:53,793
we were on our honeymoon,
and I was staying

00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:56,462
at a friend's house 'cause we
didn't have money for a hotel.

00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:57,830
And it was late night,
on the laptop,

00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:01,534
finishing up the details,
and we had a goal of $15,000.

00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:03,269
And I was just hoping
we would meet our goal

00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:04,637
over the 45‐day campaign.

00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,439
And I went
to bed that night,

00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:09,242
and I woke up and there was
already $80,000 funded.

00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,176
‐Good for you.
‐$80,000?

00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:10,676
‐Yeah.
‐Wow.

00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,578
We had hit our goal
in 40 minutes.

00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,214
I have to admit,
I thought every niche

00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,582
of the denim market
was covered.

00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,484
‐[ Chuckles ]
‐I have never heard of this.

00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,520
‐I really applaud you.
‐That first Kickstarter,

00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,489
by the way, went on
to fund over $735,000.

00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:26,259
‐What?!
‐You did $735,000

00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,326
on Kickstarter?
‐You did $735,000?

00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,761
‐Yeah.
‐On a percentage basis,

00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:33,166
I'm gonna assume
that a healthy denim company

00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,301
can make 15% pre‐tax, right?

00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:36,602
Our margins are
a little bit better.

00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:40,072
Our gross profit on
last year's $1.1 million

00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:40,773
was around $700,000.

00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,709
What do you think you'll do
on this year's $2.3 million?

00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:47,246
Our gross should be
around $1.5 million.

00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:48,481
Is that after
you've paid yourselves?

00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:51,484
‐Um, no but we've ‐‐
‐That's impressive, guys.

00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,419
An investor has to know
your getting paid

00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,554
and all the employees.

00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:56,689
If you normalized all that,
what are you gonna make?

00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,458
Free cash flow for this
year should be around

00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,759
half a million dollars.
Good for you.

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,494
Did we ever ask
how much the jeans are?

00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:02,595
They retail for $149.

00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:04,363
That's not bad.
And what's your cost for them?

00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:05,298
Between 15 and 20 bucks.

00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,332
‐Wow.
‐Oh, wow.

00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,167
Do you have a problem
with inventory?

00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,602
We do. A bad one.
Yeah.

00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:12,271
Uh, the problem is that
we sell the stuff so fast,

00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,240
we don't have the cash
to buy a couple...

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,508
To take a risk.
... to kind of ease it up.

00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:17,243
And that's
why we're here,

00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:19,178
because we need a Shark
to help us

00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,379
get over
our inventory hurdle,

00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,348
so we can get ahead of the curve
and actually meet the dema‐‐

00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:24,317
Hunter, I know this
business pretty well.

00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,352
It's a management
of inventory business.

00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,387
It's very, very tough.

00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:32,391
And it sucks cash
like there is no tomorrow.

00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,494
And I'm not saying you can't ‐‐
‐You said it, brother.

00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,395
Yeah. I'm not saying
you can't fix it,

00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:41,501
but at a $10 million valuation,
started as an investor...

00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,269
I mean, you guys are from Vegas.

00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:44,670
You're asking me
to roll the dice.

00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,407
And I like to gamble,
but under this valuation,

00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:50,610
it's too big a risk right now.

00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,478
Do you want me to tell you
what you're worth today?

00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,580
What you'd get in the private
equity market valuation?

00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,048
I'm sure
you're gonna tell us.

00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:56,716
[ Laughter ]

00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:59,185
‐We're ready, we're ready.
‐I know you need to know it.

00:16:59,185 --> 00:16:59,852
And thank goodness I'm here.

00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,622
I think, if you could actually
get a private equity firm

00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:06,759
to invest pre‐money at
$5 million, you're a rock star.

00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:08,728
I don't think you could,

00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:10,596
but if you could,
that would be the max.

00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:11,664
‐I think‐‐
‐We're here to negotiate, so...

00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:12,899
We're here to make a deal.
Like, like I said,

00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:16,602
we're good at what we do, but we
know the value you guys bring.

00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:19,539
So, let me tell you
what I think about it.

00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,208
I have 15 clothing brands,
all right?

00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,277
And, um,
12 of them are dead.

00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:28,214
The reason why I still invest
in apparel business is

00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:29,715
they have to have
a couple criteria.

00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:33,152
I want it to be somewhere
in the sports and athleticism,

00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,287
but not denim.

00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:36,522
I want it to be somebody
who has to buy

00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,524
a new pair of shoes
every three months

00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:40,626
or they've been doing yoga
and they have to buy

00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:43,429
a new pair of spandex
every three months.

00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:47,733
Denim, the more damage it gets,
the cooler it is, right?

00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,403
So, you don't get to re‐sell
that type of stuff in my world.

00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,571
‐Yeah.
‐Yeah.

00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:55,808
The last thing I want to do
right now is denim, so I'm out.

00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:01,514
Guys, I just want to point out,
on an after‐tax basis

00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:04,617
for a clothing company,
you're asking 30 times.

00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:06,419
Yeah, but none are growing
as fast as they are.

00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,588
Yeah, but that is
an extraordinary multiple.

00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,424
It's not the multiple
that's the issue with me, guys.

00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,560
The issue is, it's hard
to create barriers to entry.

00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,331
The minute someone says, "Dang,
but Barbell is killing it,

00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:20,633
I love their clothes,
but I can't get them,"

00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:23,402
then that creates opportunity
for somebody else.

00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:24,704
I'm not saying you're
not gonna be successful.

00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:28,674
Look, 99.99%
of entrepreneurs in this world,

00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,477
if you told them they could have
$500,000 net cash flow

00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,312
after paying themselves,

00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:34,647
would cut off their hand
to get it.

00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:36,582
So you guys are
doing amazing things.

00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:41,120
The question is how you overcome
not being able to protect it.

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,255
I'm out.

00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:44,423
Thank you,
we appreciate your time.

00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:45,758
‐Yeah, thank you, Mark.
‐And congratulations, guys.

00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:49,095
You guys, listen,
I give you serious props

00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:49,695
for what you've done.

00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:53,332
Getting into this industry
is hard as can be.

00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,568
And you guys actually
created something new.

00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:59,705
Where I don't think there's
been anything new in forever.

00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:03,309
But I can't see where
this would be an investment

00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:06,512
that's right for me,
so I'm out.

00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:10,249
But like I said,
serious props to you guys.

00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:11,517
‐Thank you very much.
‐Thank you, Lori.

00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:14,387
Guys, um,
the inventory scares me.

00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:16,422
If I was ever gonna
get into jeans,

00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:17,590
it would be
the two of you guys ‐‐

00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,526
I'll tell you this,
before you go any further,

00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,962
is that we are ‐‐ we are good
at inventory projection.

00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:23,696
I know what I'm gonna sell.

00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:25,264
I just need to be able
to buy it.

00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:27,199
And we have great
manufacturing terms.

00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,367
We're really good
at sourcing,

00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,503
and we can get our lead times
down as low as six weeks.

00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:31,637
Yeah, Hunter,
I can't get there.

00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,472
It's just more inventory,
more money.

00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:34,640
You guys are great operators,

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,442
and that's
the greatest compliment

00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:38,344
I can give somebody
as an entrepreneur.

00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,379
Inventory scares me.

00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:41,547
I'm out.

00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,549
‐I understand.
‐Yeah.

00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:48,521
So, guys, who can downplay
or even suggest you guys

00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,289
haven't done a phenomenal job

00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,224
in such a brutally
competitive space.

00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:53,259
I mean, that's what it is.

00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:55,661
But this thing's
gonna inhale cash,

00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,797
it's not gonna be
a very liquid situation for us.

00:19:57,797 --> 00:20:00,433
‐Yeah, that's the problem.
‐It'll exhale cash, too.

00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:01,567
With our margins,
it's gonna be

00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,269
one of the best investments
you ever had.

00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:05,337
It will, but it will
inhale cash,

00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:07,273
as every
clothing industry does.

00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:09,208
As Mark said,
it'll exhale cash, too.

00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,409
It's a very difficult deal.

00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,912
I'm gonna pass.
I'm out.

00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,584
I think the lesson,
and we've all learned it

00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:21,387
together here today,
this is not Las Vegas.

00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,456
$500,000 is a ton of money.

00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:25,691
Had you asked for less,

00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:29,395
you'd probably be
walking out with a Shark.

00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,496
Good luck.

00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:31,664

research the foods,

How much does it cost?

00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:37,309
All right, so the ring by itself
costs about $1.68 per unit.

00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:38,443
‐For you to make?
‐Correct.

00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:40,512
I sell it for $12 retail.

00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:43,081
‐Wow.
‐And I have 150 stores

00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:43,615
that I'm in currently.

00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:44,716
Cuban: And what's your
wholesale to them?

00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:48,286
Wholesale to them is $6.00.
We're 70% margin.

00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:49,788
What about the big box guys
in outdoors?

00:34:49,788 --> 00:34:52,657
Keep in mind,
we're less than 17 months old.

00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,526
We're getting there.
I flew out to Bentonville

00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:56,261
and talked to Walmart.

00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:57,429
‐And?
‐We didn't quite

00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:58,763
get to the price point
we want ‐‐

00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,032
O'Leary: They didn't like
the 12 bucks, did they?

00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:01,533
Correct.

00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:02,734
They wanted to retail it
at $4.99.

00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:05,370
But, Vance, you have enough
margin to sell it for that.

00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:06,438
What was the issue?

00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,406
Here's the challenge.
So, I'm a young company.

00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:12,243
If I do that and I upset
all the dealers that I'm in,

00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:13,545
and I'm picking up
dealers regularly,

00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:15,647
and then Walmart
pulls the plug on me

00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:17,515
and I've upset all my dealers...
Good for you. Smart.

00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:19,351
...I've got a really good
margin, I've got ‐‐

00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:20,385
Vance, I want
to tell you a story,

00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:21,486
and I want you
to listen hard, okay?

00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:22,554
‐Oh, Lord, here we go.
‐Oh, God.

00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:24,255
'Cause I think
you're gonna appreciate it.

00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:25,624
I too flew
to Bentonville once,

00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:28,426
to try and sell
software to them.

00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:30,729
The industry priced
all software $39.95.

00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:34,399
And I'm doing $350 million
a year at that price.

00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:36,234
The price of the computer
was $1,200.

00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:38,236
I sat with the buyer,
and he said to me,

00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:42,507
"We want to sell
your software for $19.95."

00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:45,310
Next week, Walmart
is gonna change the price of PCs

00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:49,347
to $999, and our opening order
for you, right here,

00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:50,649
is $24 million.

00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,317
You have 10 minutes
to decide,

00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:54,119
your competitor's
waiting outside.

00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:55,453
What do you think I did?

00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:56,655
You took it.
Exactly.

00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:59,391
Our sales grew to
$1 billion that year.

00:35:59,391 --> 00:36:02,260
Walmart changed the industry
by pricing at a point

00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,561
that they understood
would move.

00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:05,764
Listen to that story.
Don't be a fool.

00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:07,632
How, how old was the company
at that point?

00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:10,235
It was in
it's sixth year.

00:36:10,235 --> 00:36:11,469
Okay. I'm less than
a year and a half.

00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:12,837
But you're a product,
you're not a company yet.

00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,206
‐Let me ask you a question.
‐Well, it's going that way.

00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:16,307
In a year,
I've developed a brand.

00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:17,742
I've people buying
my apparel line,

00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:20,245
which I think there's
a great play here to expand in.

00:36:20,245 --> 00:36:21,646
‐Oh, no, no.
‐Don't do that.

00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:23,381
This is, this is long‐term.
Not now.

00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:25,150
I haven't even scratched
the surface with this.

00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,284
The fact that
you've made them

00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:28,386
and sold it to them
is a huge red flag.

00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:31,122
Vance, I think you're
gonna get knocked off.

00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:32,691
My dad loved fishing.

00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,726
He actually had a product
that was similar to this.

00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:36,661
He had a ring,
he put it on his pinky,

00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:38,863
and it was like
a little mini‐sickle.

00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:42,367
He cut line all the time
'cause I always got it tangled.

00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:44,736
But mostly, I can't
do a deal with you,

00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:47,305
'cause you thought
I was Polish and not Croatian.

00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:48,540
[ Laughter ]
So...

00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,375
‐Damn you!
‐I caught it.

00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,509
‐Damn you!
‐It was your parents,

00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:53,545
Polish immigrants.
‐Yeah, I'm out.

00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:56,614
Vance, let me simplify it.
I'm not a fisherman.

00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:58,750
You know, anybody
who goes into clothing

00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,453
when they're just getting
started always scares me.

00:37:01,453 --> 00:37:03,521
It's not really a fit
for me, so I'm out.

00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:05,590
Well, I'm sorry to hear that,
but thank you for your time.

00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,425
What are you gonna do
with the money?

00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:09,728
Okay, so the $120,000

00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:12,664
is gonna split in pretty much
key categories ‐‐

00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:15,533
marketing, inventory,
and then I need help.

00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:18,503
Like, I'm running two companies,
I did the website.

00:37:18,503 --> 00:37:20,638
Those displays are built by me.

00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:24,309
I cut off a Halloween arm,
cut the bloody stump off,

00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:25,243
painted them silver.

00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,344
[ Laughter ]

00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:28,146
The, the signs ‐‐
I like this guy.

00:37:28,146 --> 00:37:29,514
‐Listen.
‐All right.

00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:33,051
I'll give you $120,000 for 40%.

00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:36,287
‐That's ‐‐ That's a...
‐Steep

00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:38,223
... a really good offer.
‐Ooh.

00:37:38,223 --> 00:37:39,491
I really appreciate it.

00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:40,558
Um, if you don't mind,

00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:41,893
I'd like to hear
if there's any other offers.

00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:45,630
I really appreciate that offer.
‐Kevin's left, Lori's left.

00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:48,466
I, um, I'm gonna make
things easy for you.

00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:50,602
I didn't like the Walmart
answer, as you know.

00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:51,836
I think you should
reconsider that.

00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:56,007
That's a ‐‐ that's a very large
distribution partner.

00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:59,577
Are you sure you want to wait
till he finishes what he says

00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:01,479
When you're talking to a guy
who's an avid fisherman

00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:02,580
and somebody who sews?

00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,916
I can help you,
or you can piss me off.

00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:05,650
‐I know.
‐He has a point.

00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,619
And I'm gonna cut
this in half for you.

00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,522
Are you sure you want to go
down that road with him?

00:38:10,522 --> 00:38:13,825
Because it may change
after that.

00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:27,372
Narrator: Two Sharks are out,
and Vance has one offer

00:38:27,372 --> 00:38:30,175
on the table from Daymond
for his fishing line cutter,

00:38:30,175 --> 00:38:31,209
Line Cutterz.

00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:33,178
However, he may
jeopardize the offer

00:38:33,178 --> 00:38:34,579
by listening
to the other Sharks.

00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:37,415
Are you sure you want to go
down that road with him?

00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:39,484
Because it may change
after that.

00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:40,685
I can go two ways.

00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:43,421
I can say I'm out and make it
easy for you to get a deal,

00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:44,522
or you can piss me off,

00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:45,657
and I'll drop this price
in half.

00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:48,526
You can say you're out,
and then I'm gonna go for 49%

00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:49,661
because he had to
second guess me.

00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,329
No, no, no, look.
I'm kind of indifferent.

00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,597
I'd be happy
to screw you up.

00:38:52,597 --> 00:38:55,967
On the other hand,
I'm a nice guy, sometimes.

00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:56,701
Are you sure?

00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:58,636
I've come a long way
and given up a lot.

00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:01,873
I'd just like to hear
if there's any other offers.

00:39:03,308 --> 00:39:06,911
Uh, I have
no interest, I'm out.

00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:12,450
Lori, you're still
in the game, or are you?

00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:15,386
I think it's genius.

00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:17,488
I really like it.

00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:19,424
And I really like you.

00:39:19,424 --> 00:39:24,629
But if Walmart is offering you
a deal, that's a huge deal.

00:39:24,629 --> 00:39:26,698
I think you should be
very careful

00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:31,269
about not rejecting
a great offer.

00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:35,240
And even more scary to me
is holding too high

00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,275
of a price point
where someone can

00:39:37,275 --> 00:39:38,576
undercut you so severely

00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:40,511
that they'll
just kill your sales.

00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:45,416
So, anyway, love you,
but I'm out.

00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:46,718
‐So, who's left?
‐You're left with Daymond

00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:49,420
with $120,000 at 40%.
The problem is ‐‐

00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,455
The problem is
in a negotiation,

00:39:50,455 --> 00:39:52,357
you become more valuable

00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:55,260
the less amount of people
are in the room, all right?

00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:58,229
And you took a chance,
and you...

00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,330
‐Ooh.
‐You're gonna make him pay

00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:02,333
a horrible price.
‐Daymond, is the tide shifting?

00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:03,568
Ooh.

00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:07,672
Well, I was open,
but because I've become

00:40:07,672 --> 00:40:10,375
more valuable, instead of
raising the price on you,

00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:13,411
that's gonna be my final
offer, without a counter.

00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,513
Take it or leave it.

00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:19,083
Daymond, is there be any chance
you would take 25%

00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,285
for $120,000 dollars?

00:40:20,285 --> 00:40:22,453
I don't think you just
heard what I said.

00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:25,523
You would've had that shot
two Sharks ago.

00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:27,458
I just wanted to hear
some advice ‐‐

00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:28,726
I understand
what you're saying.

00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:31,763
But now I'm the only person
in the room with you.

00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:35,566
If you and I start
as partners and I ask for 40%,

00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:38,603
that means I'm coming
with the heat.

00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,672
Cuban: Just remember,
60% of a watermelon

00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:43,408
is a whole lot better
than 100% of a grape.

00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:47,312
I understand, and I have fought
and clawed my way here.

00:40:47,312 --> 00:40:49,714
And to give up 40%
is ‐‐ is just ‐‐

00:40:49,714 --> 00:40:51,582
I would've gotten
an investor right away.

00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:53,584
I'm literally ‐‐
I've given everything.

00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:54,652
And you were one of the Sharks

00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:56,354
I came in wanting
to do a deal with.

00:40:56,354 --> 00:40:58,289
I think we can both
make a lot of money.

00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,491
Um, just 40% is...

00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:02,493
‐Then make him a counter.
‐He did.

00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:03,561
25% for $120,000.

00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,296
O'Leary: But he doesn't
want that counter.

00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,497
We just launched on Amazon.

00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:08,232
I'm telling you,
this thing is just about ‐‐

00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:09,434
I've done all the work.

00:41:09,434 --> 00:41:11,369
It's just it's about to blow up.
‐Oh, you don't know the work

00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:12,704
that's ahead of you,
which I think I will enjoy.

00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:15,206
Herjavec: Vance, it's not
selling time, it's closing time.

00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:16,207
I'm not going
to counter on it.

00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:17,408
I need to know
that you believe in me,

00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:19,243
and I will believe in you.
‐Vance, what are you gonna do?

00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:20,345
I'm not gonna
take advantage of you.

00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:22,246
He has no flexibility.
What are you gonna do?

00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:25,049
You've got 15 seconds
to answer me.

00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:26,584
