let's say, 80%,

Mm‐hmm.

00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:27,980

a little bit constrained,

00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,617
you're gonna make really,
really, really good money.

00:27:31,617 --> 00:27:33,452
When you try to scale
like that,

00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:35,487
a whole new set

00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,423
Yep.
A whole new concept
of how you're funding it

00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:39,691

to pay for that.

00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:41,393

00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:42,528
Yes.

as much money.

00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:45,898

00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:47,766
Now, with our costs
being lowered,

00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:48,967
we feel it's important

00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:51,103
that we do make it
an accessible product

00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:52,538
because of our history
as educators.

00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:53,739
So you want to lower
your price?

00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:55,440

Okay.

right business decision?
What would you lower it to?

00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:59,444

we need expertise and help

as many people as we can.
That's fair enough.

But then you have to change
your business plan,

at $52 in the plush category.

00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:17,462

that 99% of plush toys

So, you were saying you don't
have, like, the right one here?

00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:08,480
Right. Correct.
Right?

00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,415
So, is this not even
in production yet?

00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:11,850
It's not in production yet.

00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:14,653
What's the material that
holds the temperature delta?

00:34:14,653 --> 00:34:18,189
Behind the stainless steel
is our trade‐secret Pronto gel.

00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:19,491
Is that patented?

00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:22,060
We have a provisional patent
on it, yes.
Okay.

00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,662
How did you come up
with this idea?

00:34:23,662 --> 00:34:25,196
I was back in college,

00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:27,065
trying to drink a bottle
of wine with a girl,

00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,767
and the wine was warm.

00:34:28,767 --> 00:34:31,136
So me being kind
of, like, the inventor type,

00:34:31,136 --> 00:34:34,439
I grabbed a pasta strainer,
I filled it with ice,

00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:35,807
poured the wine through,

00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:38,543
and amazingly, the wine
was super‐cold super‐fast.

00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:39,878
And we go to drink the wine,

00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:41,112
and it was
just horribly disgusting.

00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:42,180
When you did that,

00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,615
you also diluted
the wine with the ice.

00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:44,616
I ruined the wine, yeah.

00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:45,884
Are you still
with the girl?

00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:47,819
So, that ‐‐ that is a huge issue
in chilling white wines.

00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:50,322
This doesn't dilute it,
which is a good thing.

00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:51,656
And I know that
because I'm a member

00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:53,792
of the Chevaliers
du Tastevin.

00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:56,595

the temperature of our wines.

Okay, can you tell us
where you're at with sales?

00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:11,042
Simone: Yes.
So, we just finished

00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:14,412
our Indiegogo crowdfunding
campaign yesterday,

00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:17,582
and we raised $54,000.

00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,985
What were you looking for?
$25,000.

00:35:19,985 --> 00:35:21,620
And what does it cost?

00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,688
On crowdfunding, it's $89.

00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:26,491
When we're actually selling it,
we'll sell it for $129.

00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:29,094
Ohh!
The cost is $22 to make.

00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:31,363
So, if you're positioning
this product

00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:33,198
as a wine chiller, basically,

00:35:33,198 --> 00:35:34,966
why do you have to put it
back in the bottle?

00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,669
The way we can get it
to chill so quickly,

00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:40,171
it basically is like
a cannon blast of cold.

00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:42,307
That's ‐‐
You're saying it freezes
if you leave it inside it?

00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:44,676
It won't freeze, but the
temperature will keep dropping.

00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:48,046
With any alcoholic drink,
there's a perfect temperature.

00:35:48,046 --> 00:35:49,914
And just to let you know,
all the temperatures

00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:51,082
are written
right on the packaging.

00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:52,117
Thank you very much.

00:35:52,117 --> 00:35:54,452
So, you seem to know
a lot about wine.

00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:56,421
What's your background?

00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:57,989
I actually studied
entrepreneurship.

00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,691
Where at?
At Arizona State.

00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:01,593
I came up with this idea,
like I said.

00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:03,662
I've worked for other start‐ups
in the past,

00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:05,163
but I've known my entire life

00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,699
that I was gonna do
something like this.

00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:10,168
So, I have no idea
why people

00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,604
aren't really going over
this valuation.

00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:15,440
So, let's look at the
crowdfunding platform you're on.

00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,375
You only sold
$54,000 worth.

00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:19,711
In two months.
The first two months.

00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:22,614
Do you have some other stuff
that's gonna give us a reason

00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:24,382
to get
to a $2 million valuation?

00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:25,550
There is another reason.

00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,885
So, one
of our biggest competitors,

00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:29,888
they're also a wine chiller,
but they take way longer,

00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:31,656
and there are other drawbacks
to the product

00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:33,558
that ProntoBev has a lot
of advantages over.

00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:35,460
What does
the competition cost?

00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,696
What does it cost?
They charge $80.

00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:38,963
They're doing how much
in business?

00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:40,331
$10 to $20 million a year.

00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:42,033
$10 million to $20 million.
That's a big ‐‐ big swing.

00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,101
‐That's a big range.
‐Yeah.

00:36:43,101 --> 00:36:44,736
But ‐‐ So, you believe
that that's why

00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:46,838
you're worth $2 million?

00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:49,441

worth far more than that.

a $2 million valuation?

00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:02,353
This company has only one
direction to go, and that's up.

00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:04,689
Well, then I've failed you,

is turning it into a company

00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:31,162
I'm willing to negotiate,

00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:32,797
but I need to keep some equity,
"A," for myself...

00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:34,465
You're right!
Yeah, don't be greedy.

00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:36,134
...'cause I should have
the majority...
That's Business School 101.

00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:38,303
...and, "B," so I can go
and raise the other $100,000.

00:40:38,303 --> 00:40:40,505
I have interested people
in the other $100,000.

00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:42,206
Look, if you had come
more advanced

00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:45,343
with sell‐through and proven
sales, that's different.

00:40:45,343 --> 00:40:46,477
I would have give you
more credit

00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:47,545
and maybe had flexibility.

00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:50,181
You have none of those things,
okay?

00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:51,816
Kevin,
are you stuck at the 50%?

00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:54,319
I said at the beginning, Robert,
I have no flexibility!

00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,587
Then give him $200,000
or $250,000.
No!

00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:57,822
Greiner: Yeah, give him
the extra $100,000 he needs.

00:40:57,822 --> 00:40:59,023

How do I raise the money, Kevin?

Where are I gonna get
the other $100,000?

00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:02,894
I get diluted, too.
So we all ‐‐

00:41:02,894 --> 00:41:04,128
Maybe I'll go in
on that route.

00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,930
Maybe I'll put more money
into it. But I'm starting ‐‐

00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,131
Yeah, now he owns
less than 50%.

00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,666
It's not his company anymore.
That's his point.

00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,702
Yeah. Then you're
gonna take more.
Cry me a river, Mark.

00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:12,370
Yes or no, Alexander?

00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:14,405
You won't budge at all?
O'Leary: None! Zero!

'Cause you're giving me
no wriggle room here.

00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,109
It's binary ‐‐ yes or no.

This is your moment.
You decide.

00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:23,948
What's your next product,
Alexander?

00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:25,316
Our next product
is a martini shaker...

00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,651
What are you talking
to him for? He's already out.

00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,386
...that ‐‐
that chills martinis.

00:41:28,386 --> 00:41:30,254
So ‐‐ So, you need...
You know, the problem
with the martini business

00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:32,724
is, wine ‐‐ w‐‐
...to get into
the martini side of it,

00:41:32,724 --> 00:41:35,193
and to do this and get it out,
you need another $100,000.

00:41:35,193 --> 00:41:37,295
Right.
How are you gonna get
the other $100,000?

00:41:37,295 --> 00:41:38,596
We have people
who are interested.

00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:39,964
I know I can get
the other $100,000.

00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:41,032
Okay.
I know I can.

00:41:41,032 --> 00:41:43,034
I'll give you $100,000
for 25%,

00:41:43,034 --> 00:41:45,837
contingent that you raise
the other $100,000.

00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:47,705
Yeah.

00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:48,706
Done.

You got to work
your ass off, okay?
I will, I will.

00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:56,514
All right.
I really will.

All right, Alexander.

made a deal with Mark Cuban.

He went out first.
I was so disappointed.
