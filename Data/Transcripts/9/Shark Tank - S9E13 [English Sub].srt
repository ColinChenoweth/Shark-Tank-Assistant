you get your cost down, right,

works and what doesn't work.

your sales so far?

a Kickstarter in 2016

and somebody who really believes

with their own products,

How much money have you raised
for this?

Zero. I put $2,000 of my own
money to build my prototype.

That's it?
Good for you.

00:27:07,593 --> 00:27:09,061
With the money from Kickstarter,
I spent that

00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:10,863
on the pre‐production costs,
which includes the tooling.

00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:13,665

I actually lived in China,

00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:16,635

office for two months.

00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,704

How'd you come up
with this?

So, I started off ‐‐
I'm a ‐‐ I'm a vinyl‐head.

00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,941
I go record shopping
every Saturday.

00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:24,977
And one Saturday, my friends
were at a park and said,

00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,078
"Hey, come meet up with us."

00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:27,246
So, I have my vinyl with me.

00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:28,847
Everybody's interested
in my vinyls.

00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:29,848
And it was like, "Wow.

00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:30,983
What'd you get?
What'd you get?"

00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,317
And everybody's going through
my vinyls.

00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,819
They're like,
"Let's listen to some."

00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,687
And I'm like,
"Well, there's really no way

00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:36,989
I can let you listen to these."

00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,657
I mean,
my apartment is about the size

00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,259
of Mr. Wonderful's tie closet.

00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:43,328
[ Laughs ]
I can't fit anybody in
my apartment at 300 square feet.

00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,763
And so I wanted to find a way

00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:46,598
that I could share my records
with my friends or families.

00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,433
So, I wanted something
that I could take with me,

00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:50,102
but usually,
portable record players are big,

00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:51,737
'cause they have to be
the size of a record

00:27:51,737 --> 00:27:53,972
in order for the record to spin.

00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:57,809
So, then, I thought about it ‐‐
rather than the record spinning,

00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:00,546
what if I made a unit
that spun around the record?

00:28:00,546 --> 00:28:02,548
Then,
it could be any size I want,

00:28:02,548 --> 00:28:03,749
and I could take it with me.

00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:05,484
So, that's when I first started
on the prototype

00:28:05,484 --> 00:28:06,518
that became RokBlok.

00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,719
What's your background?

How did you know
how to make something like this?

00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:12,791
Yeah. You know, actually, this
was my first hardware project.

00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:15,360
I taught myself electrical
engineering on YouTube.

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,696
So, you're not
an engineer?
So, you didn't hire
an engineer ‐‐

00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,298
you figured this all out
by yourself?

00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:20,499
That's impressive.

00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:22,501
Did you file a patent
on this?

00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:23,936
I did file a utility patent.

00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,737
A utility patent.

00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:27,439

transmission of audio from
a stationary disc.
