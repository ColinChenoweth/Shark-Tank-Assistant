And what is the price
of that?

00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:46,947
Ideally, when I get to retail,

00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:48,748
I want them to retail
for $15.99.

00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,784

that a standard

00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:54,588
comparative plastic set
is going to be around $10.

00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:56,423
And you're at $15.99.

00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:57,691

a better mouse trap.

But it's definitely more ‐‐

it's 50% more.

00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:03,597

to demonstrate it

00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:06,967
for people to see the value
and really have it register.

00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:08,134

‐That's another challenge.

right there.

the $100,000.

I do want 20% because
it's a very young business.

so you can hold
a standard cup.

00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:26,486
I would guess 70%
of the cups out there

00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:28,588

and shape.

is way too high

redesign the package.

Solo cups as a case study.

As a case study, they're doing
$1.6 billion a year in cups.

So if you just make it the plate
to fit every other cup,

00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:03,623
you could lose that potential.

a really good idea

take any cup out there,

yours or keep yours...

00:26:56,148 --> 00:27:00,018
We're going to make $130,000
in top‐line revenue this year.

00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:02,087
‐Are you paid a salary?
‐I pay myself nothing.

00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:03,422

my full‐time job.

00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:04,623
‐You do?!
‐You do?

00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,024
‐Yes.
‐Wait a minute.

Who's running Recharj?
Who's in there day to day?

00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:11,396
I've hired
a subject matter expert

00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:13,866

00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:16,969

So you're paying her
a salary.

She managers the day
to day operation.

00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:23,375
Are there other employees
that do the classes

00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:24,443
and do other things?

00:27:24,443 --> 00:27:26,445
Yeah, so we've got
about a network

00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:29,748
of 40 outside instructors,
and they really facilitate ‐‐

00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:31,350
‐40?
‐Well, it's a network.

00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,885
They're part‐time.
They're 1099's.

00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:34,720
‐But 40?
‐They come in, teach a class ‐‐

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,488
Well, remember,
we are not just a studio,

00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,057
we also do a lot
of corporate events, as well.

00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:41,793
So we plan on franchising
within two to three years.

00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:45,931
Oh, Daniel, Daniel, Daniel,
you are so all over the map.

00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:48,834
$300,000 so far to do
$130,000 a year

00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,769
that'll break you even,
right?

00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:51,937
‐Correct.
‐And that's including you

00:27:51,937 --> 00:27:54,173
having 40 people going
basically door to door

00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,541
to sell a wellness services.

00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:56,842
Which there's a market for.

Okay, well,
that's even worse, right?

00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,648
They should be doing both.

Effectively, you have
only 800 square feet.

I don't know what the hell else
you spend the money on.

00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:09,721

Daniel. I'm out.

I see your competition.

00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:26,538
At Landmark Theatres, we have
these incredibly comfortable

00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,407
couches and we have beds.

00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:30,275
People actually go in there
when they want a break

00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:32,344
and they'll bring
their eye covers,

00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:33,679
they'll bring headphones.

00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:34,980
And they'll just kick back
and they just pass out.

00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,715
There's no privacy there.

You got a curtain!

That's not competitive, Mark.
It's very different.

Oh, no, it's definitely

going on in the background.

00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:44,623
I disagree with Mark

that the Landmark
"Fast and the Furious 17"

lie down ‐‐
Not every movie

is "Fast and the Furious",
right?

00:28:49,795 --> 00:28:52,130
All right, so
"Driving Miss Daisy 7".

00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,699
You can go to a movie with
subtitles that you don't even

understand
and just pass out.

00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:56,134
Yeah, Mark, nobody's
coming to your movie theater.

00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:57,436
Let it go.

00:28:57,436 --> 00:28:59,938
My problem is this, look,
what you've tapped into

00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,840
is obviously a huge need
in this country.

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,076
We push people beyond
the limits that we push to.

00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,677
And it's completely
unsustainable.

00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:09,147
So I think philosophically
where you're going, checkmark.

00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:10,249
‐I like it.
‐Yeah.

00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,717
But it seems like
a higher investment cost

00:29:11,717 --> 00:29:14,553
relative to what you're
making in revenue.

00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:16,355
So for me, the juice
is not worth the squeeze.

I appreciate it.

Now would you consider

I disagree with Rohan.

I just have
a fundamental challenge

with the entire concept.

Look, I sleep three

Oh, come on, man.

00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:56,728
I think most people
in America

00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:59,798
don't have the luxury of
being able to leave their job

00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,467
and go take a nap
in the middle of the day.

00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,504
For that reason, I'm out.

00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:08,173
We're seeing people do it,
but I appreciate.

00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:10,142
And one of the things
I always say to entrepreneurs

00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,376
or people that have ideas

00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:13,545
is sometimes you just
have too many.

00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:16,014
You're trying, like, an octopus
to tentacle out everywhere.

00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:17,115
You can drown in
opportunity.

00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:19,918
Yes. You have, like,
four tentacles going.

00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:21,586
It's a good cause.
It's a healthy cause.

00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:24,022
I like mindfulness.
I mediate.

00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:28,327
But I think it'll be easier
for you and a better route

00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:31,229
to take it to businesses,
sell those beds,

00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:32,631
and get them set up.

00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:34,333
I don't think the route
that you're going

00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,034
would be a right
investment for me.

00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:37,235
So I'm out.

00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:39,638

a couple hundred
thousand dollars

00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:53,618
to open up another spot
only to break even?

00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:56,421
That you claim
is a break even,

00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:59,424
it really is never a break even
till you recoup your costs.

that we've invested in.

you get a glob of ketchup
all over your t‐shirt.

00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:35,547
Or maybe you're someone
who likes mustard.

00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:36,681
Corcoran:
Don't do it!

00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:37,382
[ Laughter ]

00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:39,117
How about some relish?

00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:41,052
[ Laughter ]

00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:42,420
You see, no matter
what you prefer,

00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,556
the shirt always stays clean

00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:46,324
because you've got Detrapel.

00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:48,393
‐And that's water?
‐That's water.

00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:51,296
Now the best part is that
one easy application

00:33:51,296 --> 00:33:52,998
lasts a whole year.

00:33:52,998 --> 00:33:56,001
With no glossy barrier,
no white discoloration,

00:33:56,001 --> 00:33:58,336
and it's completely non‐toxic.

00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:03,542
Our formula is so safe
that you could even do this.

00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:04,509
Oh, my God!

00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:05,977
No need to worry
about carcinogens

00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:07,746
or the need for protective gear.

00:34:07,746 --> 00:34:09,581
Sharks, we're a young,
growing brand

00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:11,516
that needs your help ramping
up production.

00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:13,785
So if you want to keep
your dorsal fins clean,

00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:15,487
then spray them with Detrapel.

00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:17,155
How'd you come up
with the idea, David?

00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:20,792
I grew up as a kid who comes
from very low‐income background.

00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,093
My parents are both immigrants.

00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:24,596
My dad's from Moscow,
my mom's from Kiev.

00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:25,730
And I came up with this idea

00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,831
'cause I really cared
about my stuff

00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:27,966
because I didn't have
that much money.

00:34:27,966 --> 00:34:30,302
Then I got these two
brand‐new Jordans

00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:32,170
that I was so psyched about.

00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:35,674
And I was so scared of
getting them dirty or messed up.

00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:36,942
So I had this idea
that I want to come up

00:34:36,942 --> 00:34:38,310
with some kind of spray

00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:40,445
that you can put on and peel
off whenever it got dirty.

00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:41,413
But I wasn't a chemical
engineer.

00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:42,981
I was a freshman in high school.

00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:45,317
So I actually pivoted my idea

00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:47,052
and did a shoe‐cleaning business

00:34:47,052 --> 00:34:49,454
for all the local university
sports teams in Philadelphia.

00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:50,455
Good for you, wow!

00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:51,590
I ran that for
about four months.

00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,358
We did about $25,000
a month in revenue.

00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:54,759
‐Cleaning shoes?
‐Cleaning shoes?!

00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,529
Cleaning shoes ‐‐ basketball
shoes, cleats, you name it.

00:34:57,529 --> 00:34:58,797
Why didn't you keep
that business going,

00:34:58,797 --> 00:35:00,065
'cause that's easy money?

00:35:00,065 --> 00:35:01,933
So I stopped the business
because I got an offer

00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,335
to sell my first business.

00:35:03,335 --> 00:35:04,970
And I sold it for $150,000.

00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:05,670
‐Wow.
‐Wow!

00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,072
Thank you, thank you.

00:35:07,072 --> 00:35:09,641
I took almost all of it
and I put it into this.

00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:10,842
This is all still while
you were in high school?

00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:12,377
This all while I was
in high school.

00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:13,979
Do you mind if I ask you
how old you are?
How old are you, David?

00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:14,779
‐I'm 19 years old.
‐You're 19?!

00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,348
‐What?!
‐No!

00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:17,916
‐Sweet, fancy Moses!
‐You're 19?

00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:19,618
‐You're a beast!
‐Oh, my God!

00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,152
I thought you were
like 30.

00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:24,456
So I sold the business, and I
began researching nanotech,

00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,324
which is the basis
of the formula.

00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:29,060
So luckily, I had a friend
who was a PhD from Drexel

00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,730
who let me use their labs
and their microscopes.

00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:34,599
So I went in during my summer
and I created a formula ‐‐

00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,267
‐So you use nanoparticles?
‐Yes.

00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:37,769
Right, so explain
what nanoparticles are.

00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:40,105
Yeah, a nanoparticle
is just, literally,

00:35:40,105 --> 00:35:42,340
if you take a regular particle
and you take it to nano size,

00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,976
it's 10th to the 9th ‐‐ negative
9th degree, which means ‐‐

00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,311
‐So it's a tiny particle.
‐Tiny.

00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:47,212
‐It's so tiny.
‐Extremely tiny,

00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:48,380
you cannot see it.

00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,514
Greiner: I have a quick
question, though.

00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:51,583
Sometimes with nanotechnology,
it's so tiny,

00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:52,951
it can go through the skin.

00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:55,320
Yes, so we're
a water‐based formula,

00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,421
which is the main reason

00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:58,023
why we're non‐toxic,
eco‐friendly.

00:35:58,023 --> 00:35:59,791
It does not penetrate
the skin, then?

00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:02,127
Your coating on your hands
and on your skin itself

00:36:02,127 --> 00:36:03,495
has a natural wax coating

00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,630
that will block anything
from going in either way,

00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,265
unless you have an open sore
or an open cut.

00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:10,235
So you create it,
you find a manufacturer...

00:36:10,235 --> 00:36:11,803
So we had a manufacturer

00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:13,571
that added a 1% to
2% proprietary part,

00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:14,773
something that was crucial
to the product

00:36:14,773 --> 00:36:16,241
that we were trying to sell.

00:36:16,241 --> 00:36:18,309
And eight months down the line,
they went bankrupt,

00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:20,812
and they refused to disclose
that 2% proprietary part.

00:36:20,812 --> 00:36:22,914
So I went on, pretty much,
a three‐year hiatus

00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:24,482
trying to re‐engineer
this formula.

00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:25,617
But, David,
where are you now?

00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:27,452
I'd like to hear the end
of the story.

00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:29,821
So the original formula
is no longer what we have.

00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:31,489
There has been a couple
slight changes.

00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:33,992
I went into a lab and we
created this same formula.

00:36:33,992 --> 00:36:35,560
‐It's your product.
‐Now it's 100% ours.

00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,995
Your pro‐‐ And what are
your sales today?

00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:39,364
This year, we're on track
to do $300,000 to $350,000.

00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:41,433
And who do you sell them to?
Who's your main customer?

00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:43,234
Now, we've really
been mainly b‐to‐b.

00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:44,469
So you're selling to
other businesses,

00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:45,904
what kind of businesses
are buying this?

00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:47,806
Yeah, the businesses that are
either creating products

00:36:47,806 --> 00:36:50,075
for consumers that they can buy,
like, furniture,

00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:51,476
like, carpet for example.

00:36:51,476 --> 00:36:53,845
Have you done any safety
testing on this?

00:36:53,845 --> 00:36:55,714
We have FDA testing done.

00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:58,483
We adhere to all the EPA
compliance regulations.

00:36:58,483 --> 00:36:59,984
What do you charge
for it, David?

00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:02,554
This is a sample size, but we
also sell as our travel size.

00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:03,855
We sell this for $12.99.

00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:05,223
And what's your cost?

00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,524
To make this, $1.14.

00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:07,726
‐Great margin.
‐You're selling this

00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,260
for $12.99 where?

00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,029
Directly on our website
right now.

00:37:11,029 --> 00:37:12,764
Is it patented?
Do you have a patent
on this thing or not?

00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:14,332
No, we haven't. Not yet.

00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:16,468
How hard would it be
for somebody to knock it off?

00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:19,337
I went to some of the largest
nano‐tech companies in the world

00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:22,173
that specifically
do things like this.

00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:23,441
None of them were able to do

00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:25,143
what we were able to do
eventually.

00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:26,611
See, that scares me
a little bit.

00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:30,081
Why do I find it
too good to be true?

00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,216
That's because I'm young,

00:37:31,216 --> 00:37:32,684
but I'm telling you here
that I'm ‐‐

00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:33,985
Age isn't the issue.

00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:35,320
‐What's that?
‐Age isn't the issue.

00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,022
If I took $200,000 and went out
and hired somebody,

00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:39,157
could I recreate Detrapel?

00:37:39,157 --> 00:37:40,859
No.

00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:43,294
I believe that wholeheartedly
that you won't be able to do it.

00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:45,730
That's simply because of
our process and on top of that,

00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,065
the way that we market.

00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:48,433
Okay, I'll shortcut this,
David.

I'll give you the $200,000,
want 25%,

00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:23,228
I really need help on
the business side of it.

Not necessarily
on the chemical side ‐‐

00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,464

that part out of it.

00:39:59,297 --> 00:40:02,967
I was thinking $200,000
for...

00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:04,535
23%.

00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:06,738
Just a little sweeter,

00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,940
just a little bit better
than the other Sharks.

he's built stuff,

I know how to build
brands.

00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:17,815
You know, there's big,
major companies

00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:19,117
out there looking
for innovation like this.

00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:21,819
They come to me to help
go find the innovation.

00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:23,354
Robert brings a skill set
that I don't have.

Together,
it's a dynamic duo.

Mark and I have decided
that we will go in together.

00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:33,197
I am very fast to market,

00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:36,267
and what I do is infomercials,
TV, and retail.

00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,568
‐I see that this ‐‐
‐'Cause none of us have ever

00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:40,071
done an infomercial.

Well, I'm not going to comment
on what anybody else does.

I only know what I can do.

00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:48,012
And I think that you
do need to move fast,

00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:49,480
you do need to blitz
the market.

00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,183
I think that Mark and I
can do that for you.

00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:54,319
I don't think necessarily
I'm your best partner in this.

00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:57,789
I think Lori and Mark are
an unbeatable combination

00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,857
and you should grab
the money and run.

00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:01,993

Lori and I are offering you
$200,000 for 25%.

Rohan and Robert made
some crazy,

00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:12,170
ridiculous offer
that's irrelevant,

00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:14,505
but it turned out to be
$200,000 for 23%.

00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:16,841
'Cause we've never built
brands on our own.
