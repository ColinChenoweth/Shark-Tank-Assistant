to the festival.

00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,586
He had a line of people
wanting food in the front,

00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:37,557
but then he had people with,
like, Tupperware and baggies,

00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:39,492
and he's like, "I don't have
time for those people.

00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:40,660
They want to take it home,

00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,162
and they want to fry it
themselves,

00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:44,197
and I'm trying to make
some money out here".
Yeah. Yeah.

00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,132
And the light bulb
went off.

00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,035
And I said, "Dude,
this is our business.

00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,371
Let's bag it and sell it".

00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:52,839
How long ago was that,
Maranda?

00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,441
This is our third year.

00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:56,876
So, I went out to our little,
local grocery store.

00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:58,878
They've got about
eight locations,

00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:00,914
and it just
started selling.

00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:02,415
Is this still
New Orleans?

00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,217
We're in ‐‐
We live in Atlanta now.
Now, okay.

00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,719
So, basically, since
those eight stores,

00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:07,620
we're now in 800 stores.

00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,056
We're in 315
Wal‐Mart stores.

00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,492
We're going into
52 Kroger stores.

00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,061
‐Wow.
‐We're in 142 Publix...

00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:15,929
‐Fantastic.
‐Wow.

00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:17,297
...Meijer and ATB.

00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:19,666
And that is really
hard to do.

00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,968
Alright, how much of your money

00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,870
do you have invested
in this business?

00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,640
Um, It's a total of $50,000
from the family.

00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,577
Well, my dad
owns 80 ‐‐
85.

00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:33,613
85%.
What?

00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:34,914
But ‐‐ But here's
the deal, guys.

00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:37,384
We are a very
strong‐knit family.

00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:41,254
If you knew me back in the day,
my credit was zero.

00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,355
I'm right there with you.

00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,757
So ‐‐
Same here.

00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:47,927
In order to get this thing
rolling, he was our front guy.

00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,396
Alright, guys.
I'm just looking at it,

00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:50,964
and saying to myself,
"Okay,

00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:53,066
how do I get there
as an investor?"

00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:58,405
You asked me for 15% here,
for $150,000.

00:08:58,405 --> 00:08:59,939
That imputes
a million‐dollar value.

00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:00,907
Yes.
Okay.

00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:02,409
As an investor,
how many times

00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:05,178
am I paying to get
to that million value?

00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,080
25 times.

00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,050
There are no food companies
on the planet Earth

00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,553
trading at a 25‐multiple
for fish fry, okay?

00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,888
Well, let me
tell you this.

00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,424
What your missing
is the consumer.

00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:18,425
Well, I'm not missing 'em.

00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:19,959
This is how all ‐‐
like you say,

00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,494
your little soldiers,
your money‐soldiers.

00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,096
Yeah, yeah.
This is how ‐‐

00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,431
I don't want them to die.
They're all dead.

00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:25,698
I don't want them to die.

00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,267
I want them to come back with
prisoners, you know that.

00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:29,169
So, listen ‐‐
so the consumer is this.

00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,337
That's where our
expertise is.

00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,940
Well, Joe Jr., you're not worth
a million bucks, buddy.

00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,177
I'm sorry.
Are you kidding me?

00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:39,512
You'd be making
a great bet, Kevin.

00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,747
Absolutely.

00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,182
To give you $150,000,

00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:44,851
I'd have to get about
50% of your business.

00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:46,019
That's what it's worth today.

00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,588
I'm not saying you won't
grow it, but I'm out.

00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,425
Well, I'm going to share
with you my thoughts.

00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,495
For me, it tasted fabulous.

00:09:55,495 --> 00:10:00,733
But not every business, to me,
is right for an investor.

00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,302
I think you're doing great,

00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:04,737
I think you're
an amazing salesperson,

00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,806
and you're killing it
at the fairs,

00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,309
but I wouldn't feel
good investing,

00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:10,910
and for that reason, I'm out.

00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,278
Thank you.
Alright.
Thank you.

00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,847
Cuban: Okay, so kind of
from my perspective,

00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:16,683
it's got to be a product
that not just that I love,

00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:18,084
but I can demonstrate.

00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:20,553
My idea of cooking
is taking a hot dog,

00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,555
wrapping it in a paper towel,

00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:23,823
and putting it in the microwave,

00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:25,959
and saying,
"Damn, this is good".
Right.

00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,194
It's just not a product
that really fits who I am,

00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:30,230
so I'm out,
but I congratulate you.

00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,332

00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:51,651
how do I invest $150,000
when your dad owns 85% of it?

00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,387
Well, he has given all authority
to Joe to make the decisions.

00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:56,523
Absolutely.

00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:59,759
I can't make you an offer
under which

00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,494
you're still going
to be smiling.

00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,030
I just can't.
You could try, Robert.

Narrator: Three Sharks are out.

00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,176
Robert likes Maranda and Joe's
fish breading product,

Joe's Gourmet Fish Fry,
but is unsure about an offer.

But you still have
one shark left.
And then
there was one.

00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,838
I think we've all been wrestling
with a couple of things here.

00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:50,243
Yes, the valuation,

like and don't like.
Yeah.

In Season 7, Dave Vasen made
a deal with Mark Cuban

00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,124
and Chris Sacca
for brightwheel,

00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,960
an online platform that
helps early educators

00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,561
connect with families.

00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:18,631
Let's see how they're doing now.

00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,166
Vasen: Before "Shark Tank",
brightwheel was being used

00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,834
in 2,500 schools in the U. S.

00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:24,804
After "Shark Tank", it's more
than 25,000 across the globe.

00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,939
Brightwheel is the all‐in‐one
solution for early education,

00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:29,609
so schools can manage everything
from staff to their billing,

00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:31,077
and parents can actually
stay connected

00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:32,779
to their kids
throughout the day.

00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:35,014
We launched the free app
to prove the concept.

00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,449
Now, we launched
a brand‐new version

00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:38,351
called brightwheel premium,
adding things like

00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:40,119
staff management,
two‐way messaging,

00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:43,289
and parents are able to sign in
from their own phone.

00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,224
Today, Mark and Chris
are joining me

00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,160

the second largest for‐profit

00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:50,129
childcare provider
in North America.

00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,698
They have been testing out
the premium version

00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:53,099
of brightwheel
in one of their schools.

00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:55,134
Our families are
absolutely loving it,

00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,903
so we're prepared
to roll with you guys

00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:59,172
on a three‐year,
million‐plus deal.

00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,973
Learning Care Group
offered a multi‐year deal

00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,241
to all 100 centers,

00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,977
20,000 teachers, hundreds
of thousands of parents,

00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,479
and they want
to do it right away.

00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:08,948
When I came in to "Shark Tank",
our company had zero revenue,

00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,317
and in just a few months since
launching brightwheel premium,

00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,853
we now booked over $2,000,000
in sales for this year.

00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:14,987
Seeing it here in the flesh,

00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:16,589
seeing the money behind
a deal like this ‐‐

00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:17,790
it's all coming true.

00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,025
Sacca: When you think about
how brightwheel

00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,127
has revolutionized
the way schools do business,

00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:22,895
and the way teachers
interact with parents,

00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,797
there's really no limit
to how big this can get.

00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,532
And I'm convinced this might be
one of the biggest deals

00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,834
"Shark Tank" has ever seen.

00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:29,235
Let's shoot
a brightwheel video.

00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,204
That's such good idea.
Yeah, let's do it.

I'm a Shark, but I'm also a dad,

00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:35,541
and I know how important
early education is.

00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,177
Now with brightwheel, we can
impact the early education

00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:41,047
of tens of millions of children
across this country.

00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,648
That's incredible,

in developing
these hair ties

00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,626
is that brands were not
able to print robust,

00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:11,663
creative designs on the
outside of the hair tie

00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:13,998
without sacrificing
performance,

00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:17,368
so we're able to use
a polyester‐based elastic blend

00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:19,471
that allowed us
to do a heat‐transfer

00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:21,673
so that we could print
all the designs that we wanted

00:37:21,673 --> 00:37:24,008
without sacrificing
the performance,

00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:27,011
and we've also used
this sleeve to cover the seam,

00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:31,116
which allows us to individually
brand all the hair ties.

00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:33,985

hair tie in the world,

‐Why did you dye his hair?

Because it was actually
a red wig.

how many whips?

We weren't counting the actual,
individual whips.

It was the days in a row.

I like you and I like this.

00:38:59,571 --> 00:39:00,939
Let me throw a deal out here

00:39:00,939 --> 00:39:02,674
because I want to be
a part of this movement.
What?!

00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:06,377
'Cause you guys make crazy
margins, so here's my offer.

00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:09,380
I'm going to give you your
$95,000 for 10%.

00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,649
However, if I've ever seen
a deal

00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:14,319
that could support
a royalty, this is it.

00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:15,653
So, here's how I get
my dough back,

00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:17,689
because 10% is nothing.
You know what I mean?

00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:22,093
So, I want two bucks off every
order until I get back $200,000,

00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,428

doubles my money.

to give me an incentive
to keep blowing up your website,

00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:35,006
because when I get
behind this, guys with hair,

00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:38,743
and even guys without hair, are
going to be ordering this thing.

00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:40,311
Uh, Kevin,
that's a generous offer.

what you're doing,

with those ties
and the headbands,

00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,596
I'd be doing a lot of black,
I'd do skull‐and‐crossbones,

00:39:58,596 --> 00:39:59,864
I would do things like that,

00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:01,599
that are just
a little bit more edgy,

00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,034
because I do feel that guys

00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:04,335
are going to gravitate
to that more.

For me, I would be redesigning
everything that you had,

00:40:21,653 --> 00:40:24,255

that you don't want that.

I believe, to have
a quality of life,

and I don't know
if you need my investment,

because if I call
you on the phone

and find out you've been
whipping your hair

00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:46,744

‐Expensive.
‐What?

Well, you realize, Kevin gave
you an offer a long time ago.

00:41:08,266 --> 00:41:10,635
What was your offer,
Kevin?
Very, very
reasonable,

00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:12,704
given that Mark's going to steal
a quarter of your business.

00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:15,340
I said I'd give you the $95,000
you asked for.

00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,709
I'll take the 10% equity
to get involved,

00:41:17,709 --> 00:41:22,280
but I want $2 from every order
until I get back $200,000.

00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,815
And that royalty goes away.

my capital back.

But then, we're still left with
our friendship and our hair,

the company versus his 25%.
