00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:21,280
and once you accumulate
100 bucks,

00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,949
we automate a payment
towards your student loan.

00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:26,485
Each member
has their own dashboard

00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:28,854
where they get to see
their daily round‐ups,

00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:30,355
check their
ChangEd balance,

00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:33,959
and also see each payment
sent to their student loan.

00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,994
The coolest part, though,
is they get to see

00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:40,065
how much time and money
they save with each payment.

00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:41,633
Your average
student‐loan holder

00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:43,802
can pay off their student loans
years sooner

00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:46,305
and for thousands less
with the ChangEd app.

00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:48,974
So, Sharks, who's ready to spare
a little bit more than change

00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:50,809
to help Americans
pay down student debt?

00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:54,346
What is your average daily users
and your average monthly users?

00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:55,814
We launched
in March,

00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:57,883
and we have
over 9,000 downloads

00:26:57,883 --> 00:27:01,353
and just under 1,000 active
and open FDIC insured accounts,

00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:03,789
and we recently ‐‐
which is a really cool stat ‐‐

00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:06,792
we sent $20,000 in student‐loan
payments since launching,

00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,794
and we hope
by the end of this year

00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,963
to reach $100,000
in student‐loan payments.

00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,030
Good for you.
We ‐‐

00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,665
Look,
I‐I think student‐loan debt

00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:15,267
is one of the greatest problems
facing this country.

00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:16,802
Right.
Right?

00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:20,472
There's $1.3 trillion
and growing in student debt.
Yeah.

00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,940
It impacts our economy,

00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,077
it impacts people's ability
to go out and get a better job.

00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:26,645
Both: Yeah.
It's crazy.

00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,447
Now, look, this isn't
gonna solve it by a long shot.
Right.

00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:30,883
But if you just make it
a little bit easier, right,

00:27:30,883 --> 00:27:32,284
then that's a positive.

00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:34,820
But from a business perspective,
how do you combat somebody

00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,322
saying, "We'll just round up
some of your credit card.

00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,757
We'll round up
some of your purchases.

00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:41,160
We're gonna do overdrafts,
we're gonna do student loans,

00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,162
we're gonna do ‐‐
pay off your house,"

00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:44,663
whatever it is,
right?

00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:47,933
How do you deal with more ‐‐
more feature‐rich competitors?

00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:49,301
We're the first platform

00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:51,637
that is specifically targeting
student‐loan debt.

00:27:51,637 --> 00:27:52,971
We've learned
over the past few months

00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:55,240
how difficult it is
to navigate to apply payments,

00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,842
so we've
developed relationships

00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:59,244
with 90% of the student‐loan
services in this country

00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:01,146
to make sure payments
are applied effectively,

00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:02,347
efficiently,
and quickly.

00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,615
The thing
with student loans,

00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:05,317
people have
an emotional attachment to them

00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:07,286
because it's ‐‐ it's tens
of thousands of dollars

00:28:07,286 --> 00:28:08,921
that you borrowed
when you were 18 years old.

00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:10,622
Hey, guys, I love the mission,
first of all.

00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:11,790
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,192
I think Mark is right.

00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,693
It's one of the biggest issues
we have in this country.

00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,262
Tell me a little bit about your
background and why this space.

00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:19,131
Yeah, so obviously,
me and Dan are brothers.

00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:20,432
He has
the better hair genetics.

00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:21,967
[ Laughter ]
But I've got
a solid ‐‐

00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:23,802
I've got a solid beard,
and I always claim that.

00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,704
We're from Chicago.

00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,005
Hi, Lori.
[ Laughter ]

00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:28,774
And we were raised
by a single mom

00:28:28,774 --> 00:28:30,776
that told us that we had to
work our butts off

00:28:30,776 --> 00:28:32,144
to get
what we wanted.

00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:34,613
She immigrated from Poland,
and she worked three jobs

00:28:34,613 --> 00:28:36,582
just to keep
clean clothes on our back

00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:37,849
and food
on the table.

00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:39,818
Going to college,
we had to borrow money,

00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,954
which kind of
landed us here, right?

00:28:41,954 --> 00:28:44,156
We have this problem now,
and we're ‐‐

00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:46,458
we're trying to address it
because we feel the pain.

00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:47,826
Like,
Dan's living at home.

00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,494
He's making
a‐a student loan payment,

00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:50,929
I think $800
student‐loan payment a month.

00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:53,265
I pay $800 in student‐loan
payments every month.
Wow.

00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:54,833
Greiner:
Is this your full‐time job?

00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,468
So, I'm ‐‐
I'm in sales.

00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:59,137
I've been in sales, uh,
for about eight years now.

00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:00,405
What do you sell?
What do you sell?

00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,741
I sell Mazdas.
And, Nick,
what do you do?

00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,810
Right now,
I work full‐time on ChangEd,

00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,478
but what I do
to make money is

00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:08,247
I wake up every morning
at 5:00,

00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:11,083
drive Uber, and drive people
to work, go to my office.

00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:14,119
And then when my day is done,
I go drive people back home,

00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,687
uh, head home,
and then just, you know ‐‐

00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:16,888
You're a hustler.
That's the way you do it,
right?

00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:17,889
That's the way
you hustle.

00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:18,890
So, like ‐‐
We're not ‐‐

00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:19,891
That's what
I'm talking about!

00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:21,593
[ Both laugh ]
Thanks, Mark.

00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,829
But besides that, you never
told us, how do you make money?

00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:25,063
How do you monetize?
Yes.

00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:26,965
Right now, we charge
$1 a month member fee.

00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:28,300
People aren't
balking at it

00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,901
because they can see
how much they're saving.

00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:31,870
How many members
did you have last month?

00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,605
We're ‐‐
We're just under 1,000,

00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,441
so I'd say open accounts
were right around 800.

00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:39,344
So you made $800
last month.

00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:40,479
Roughly.
Roughly $800,
yep.

00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:43,515
Dan and Mitch,
I love your energy. Absolutely.

00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:44,516
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:45,584
Corcoran:
I mean, who wouldn't want

00:29:45,584 --> 00:29:46,885
to come to your party
and play?

00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:48,053
[ Both laugh ]
That kind of thing,
right?

00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:49,554
Uh, the part that I don't trust
totally, and I wish I could,

00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:51,623
is I just can't picture
if I'm a bank

00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,325
just sitting
on the sidelines

00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:54,993
and not rounding up
people's change,

00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:56,161
which you're already doing,

00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:57,829
and applying it
to the student loan.

00:29:57,829 --> 00:30:00,032
I think
it's just that extra step.

00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:03,735
But on top of that, it gives
them on trade to refinancing.

00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:04,770
For that reason,
I'm out.

00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,371
All right, thank you so much,
Barbara.

00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:07,939
Pleasure.
Thank you.

00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:10,242
Hey, guys, I‐I just want to say,
first of all, congrats.

00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:11,977
I love the passion.
Thank you so much.

00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,612
Two brothers,
single mother.

00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:14,913
Totally relate with that.

00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:16,348
A few things I don't like.

00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:19,451
I don't like that you don't have
a real competitive advantage,

00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:22,087
and I also don't like
that you don't have a defense

00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:23,221
for your competitors.

00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:24,956
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:26,525
All right, Alex.
Thank you for your time.

00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:30,195
All right, guys, why is this
a $1.6 million valuation?

00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:34,199
As you guys well know, uh,
a company at a stage like us,

00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:36,068
the valuation is more
of an art than a science,

00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:38,337
but we've talked
to experts ‐‐
[ Laughs ]

00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,105
I'm just saying.
Greiner:
You're getting creative.

00:30:40,105 --> 00:30:41,473
That's the best answer ever!

00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:43,141
It really is.
Herjavec: Yeah.

00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:44,209
It's very difficult

00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:46,545
to ‐‐ to value a company
at our stage, right?

00:30:46,545 --> 00:30:49,348
But we're in a market that is
screaming for a solution,

00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:50,849
and we feel that we have
the right solution.

00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,117
Not only that,

00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:53,985
we've talked to experts
in the valuation space

00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:55,153
that valued our company

00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:57,222
anywhere from $1.6 million
to $2.5 million.

00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:59,391
And because we know the value
that you guys can bring ‐‐

00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:01,760
Herjavec: So, hang on.
Let me tell you something.

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,829
I like to paint.

00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:05,497
I like to sing.
Mm‐hmm.

00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:06,998
I write some poetry.
Yeah.                     Okay.

00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:09,167
I'm a bit
of a dancer, too.

00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:11,002
So I like to think
I'm an artist.

00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,003
Okay.

00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:13,905
You said
valuations are art.

00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:15,674
Here's my stab
at art.

00:31:15,674 --> 00:31:17,142
Okay. [ Laughs ]

00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:19,311
And honestly, there's lots of
things I don't like about it.

00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:21,413
I just love you guys.
Yeah.

00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:23,148
Thank you so much.
You guys are fantastic.

00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:24,483
I think
you're gonna hustle.

00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:27,152
But it's brand‐new
and it's early.

00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:31,523
I'll give you the $250,000,
but I want 48%.

00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:32,657
[ Laughs ]
Wow.

00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:33,692
Oh, my God.

00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:35,060
Rodriguez:
Highway robbery.

00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,762
We really ‐‐ We really love
the stroke of your brush,

00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:38,797
but we'd love to hear
the other offers.

00:31:38,797 --> 00:31:41,433
Greiner:
Okay, I love what it does.

00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:43,001
I think
it's very admirable.

00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,169
It's a huge problem.

00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:46,004
It's a crippling problem
for most people.

00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:47,839
Right.
On the flip side,

00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:52,377
I feel that your valuation
is a little, um, rich.

00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:54,713
Oh!
Do you?
So I'm going to go out.

00:31:54,713 --> 00:31:56,515
All right, Lori, thank you
so much for your time.
Thank you.

00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:58,750
Okay, so, guys,
have you raised other money?

00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,419
Uh, so we've
bootstrapped this

00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:01,653
up until
a couple months ago.

00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:02,854
We raised a small
friends and family run

00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:04,022
of around $50,000.

00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:05,690
Got it. How much have you all
put in yourself?

00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,826
Uh, I've put in pretty much
my entire life savings

00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:08,994
of about $30,000.

00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:10,729
And my ‐‐ my ‐‐
my time savings.

00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:12,664
I'm spending so much time
on ChangEd.

00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:14,699
He ‐‐
He's the sweat equity.
I‐I ‐‐

00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:16,568
[ Laughs ]
Me and Dan are all about
smiling, dialing,

00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:17,736
walking and talking,

00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:20,071
and slaying
and paying down student loans.

00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:21,873

I would do $150,000...

50%.

Two Sharks are out.

00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:32,670
Martin is seeking $150,000 for
15% of his company, SnapClips.

00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,239
Lori is interested,

00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:37,075
but she wants
50% of the business.

00:39:37,075 --> 00:39:38,943
Herjavec: 50%?
Greiner:
50/50 partners.

00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:40,478
And I'm gonna
tell you why.

00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:42,380
You're 19.
You're in school.

Uh‐huh.

00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:49,954
This is a clever idea,
and you have a patent.

00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:52,056
But somebody
has to come in

00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,525
and take this
from ground zero...

00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:55,994
Turn it
into a company.

00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:58,196
...and turn it
into something big.

00:39:58,196 --> 00:40:02,267
And that's a lot, a lot,
a lot, a lot of work.

00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:05,136
Now, I've done it
with our Simply Fit Board,

We've done hundreds
of millions in sales.

But you don't get that
without really putting in

00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:14,979
an incredible amount
of work,

00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:16,648
which is why
I'm offering,

wants to come in with me.

What do you think
about that?

Uh, I mean, I think the equity
is a little bit high.

I‐I don't want to give up 50%.

00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:31,429

several entrepreneurs

where they were your age
or a little bit younger, even.

retailers, licensing.

Let me hear
what you would counter.
Forget the counter.

00:40:57,889 --> 00:41:00,224
Okay, look,
it does take a lot of work,

00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:02,293
but you deserve a ton of credit,
all right?

00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,629
I think her offer of 50%
is ridiculous.

00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:06,464
I would never tell anybody
to take that.

00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,765
Now, 15% isn't enough,

00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:10,668
but I do think Alex and Lori
could add some value.

00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:12,136
So here's my offer.

00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,305
I'll convince these guys
to come in,
