was so severe that I would
never be able to survive

any type of education.

While you might be great

00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,698
I think it's a little dicey

I find your messaging

I'm not sure it's
a message ‐‐ save your finger,

a fashion statement.

And trying to relay
both of those,

and even in your packaging,
I don't see that messaging,

00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:53,853
so I don't find that clarity

00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:56,555

the customer that you want.

I understand a little bit
about every business.

00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:12,505
There's been a couple
of times in nine seasons,

and I'm sitting here,

00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:17,576
and I'm going, "I have no clue
why people are buying this."

00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:20,513
That was Tipsy Elves,
and it was Sand Cloud.

didn't understand at the time.

So sometimes your consumers

Barb is dead‐on.

Let me give you an alternative.

When you walked in here,

I really like it.

00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:29,014
To me, the opportunity here
is to leverage that platform,

00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,417
you call the Something Wonderful
platform, to reduce

00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:32,585

I'm gonna give you
the $500,000 as a loan.

00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:42,995
And because you can afford it,
you're gonna pay me $2 per order

until I make back $1.5 million,
then it goes away.

that this was, like, your little

just pour into your...

makes my coffee taste better,

a great thing."

that I have to pour this

00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:22,054

they told me that 97%

is sold for under $12 a bottle.

00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:27,959
That is 97% of the market.

00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:31,029

you're in that 3% niche

to pay and go through the hassle

your background first.

00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:32,998
So I've always been
a salesperson,

00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:36,568
and I've always loved
finding good products and then,

00:35:36,568 --> 00:35:39,838
you know, getting people
to buy them.

00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:43,775
When I became a mom,
my focus shifted obviously.

00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:45,777
My kids were playing
in their room one day,

00:35:45,777 --> 00:35:48,580
but as I walked in, I saw
all these toys on the ground.

00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:52,717
I literally went in, like,
snuck a toy,

00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:55,487
very disturbingly shoved
a brush in it,

00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,656
and then like, I'm like,
around the corner

00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,624
like [high‐pitched voice]
"Hey, everybody,

00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:01,026
who wants to brush their hair?"

00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:04,629
And like, game‐changer
at that point. No joke.

00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:05,964
But this is
an ordinary brush

00:36:05,964 --> 00:36:08,333
with a hippopotamus
attached to it.

00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,434
I would not say ordinary,

00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:11,636
because I will tell you,
I spent ‐‐

00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:14,472
No, but is it because it's
a hippo that the kids like

00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:15,540
the fact that it's a toy?

00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,641
Because it's a brush.

00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:17,909
No, no, no. Let me explain
something about brushes.

00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:19,744
What do you mean, "No, no, no."
I'm looking. That's a brush.

it ‐‐ you're not feeling it,

to brush it with.

is this any different

than any other brush
I can buy for 5 cents?

No, stay on the brush.

nothing like this?

00:36:45,837 --> 00:36:47,005
Do you have
a patent on it?

00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:49,574
‐Provisional utility patent.
‐You've got to be kidding.

brush is unique?

What, you're saying
this brush is patentable?

00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:55,513
This specific brush
says that it's meant

for all hair types,
and it is.

00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:57,682

00:36:57,682 --> 00:36:59,784
Or you borrowed this brush
and put the animal on top?

00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:01,553
No, no, no.
I have it made in China.

00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:02,454
What does it cost?

00:37:02,454 --> 00:37:03,822
So it's $2.60 landed.

and it retails for $12.

00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:10,228

My husband got diagnosed
with a brain disease last year.

And so I have to be honest
with you ‐‐ I knew

00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:37,789

but I also knew I had

had to take care of my kids.

the sales are $8,000.
