You actually have to have
a very big, wide distribution,

it requires a ton of money.

I think the hardest
possible place to sell it

00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,309

Don't force her.

you have a genius product,

but you don't have
a company yet, right?

00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,971

Ehan: So, what it's gonna do is,
it's gonna reduce inflammation

00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,292
and it's also gonna help
repair micro‐tears

00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:21,427
in the tendons that run along
the bottom of your foot.

00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,663
‐How old are you?
‐I'm 17.

00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:25,465

00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:28,935
Plantar fasciitis ‐‐
I see that's right on the box.
Ehan: Yes.

00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:32,739
Can you explain what this is,
and why this helps it?

00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:35,508
So, what plantar fasciitis is,
is where you get micro tears

00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:37,710
in the tendons that run along
the bottom of your foot,

00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,113
and, unfortunately,
2 million people per year

00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:41,381
get this condition,

00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,549
and my mom was one
of those 2 million people.

00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,851
I hated seeing her in pain,
so I figured

00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:46,586
there's got to be
a way to help her out.

00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:48,755
And it turns out that doctors
recommend freezing

00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:50,423
a water bottle
and rolling your foot on it,

00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:52,558
but if you've ever
frozen a water bottle,

00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,693
you know it has the tendency

00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:55,428
to explode every once
in a while.

00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:56,929
So, I figured there's got
to be a better way

00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,599
to help people alleviate
their foot pain,

00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:01,567
but also be simple
and easy to use.

00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,169
So I came up
with the Solemender,

00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:04,871
and what happened was,
my dad,

00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:06,773
and he is a little bit
of an expert

00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:08,541
compared to me
on plantar fasciitis.

00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:09,675
Why is Dad an expert?

00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,277
So, I'm an internal
medicine physician,

00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:12,779
been doing it
for about 20 years.

00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,648
His mom, my wife,
is a rheumatologist,

00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,150
and she does arthritis,

00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,285
musculoskeletal disease,
and so forth.

00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:22,555
So, he came up to us
with this idea, and we said,

00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:23,790
"Uh, it sounds great.

00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,725
But it's got to have been done."
Wasn't done.

00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:27,427
We use marbles.
The Mavs use marbles.

00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,728
Right.
So, people use marbles,

00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:31,364
people use coffee cans,
people use golf balls.

00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:33,332
I think I have
your first client.

00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:34,801
I play with a guy
named Ichiro

who's gonna go straight
into the Hall of Fame,

00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:39,005
and every day
for about an hour,

00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:42,542
he would sit there in front
of his locker and do this...

00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:43,843
for 45 minutes.
On what?

00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:46,145
And then he went out
and got four hits every night.

00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,547
Wait, what was he
doing that on?

00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:48,748
What on ‐‐
on a device like this?

00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:50,082
He used, like,
a little golf ball.

00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,083
Oh, I was wondering.

00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,585
What are your sales?

00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:56,155
So, we've done $25,000
in just under a year,

00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:58,758
and it's been a lot of me
going door‐to‐door,

00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:00,493
talking to all these
different people.

00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:02,628
We've been very fortunate
that 11 stores were

00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,197
really, really excited
about the Solemender,

00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:07,200
really excited about young
entrepreneurs and all that.

00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,469
Have they re‐ordered
them from you?
Yes.

00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,037
Yes, so we will get
a re‐order depending

00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:14,240
on how sales are in the season
every one to two weeks.

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,309
And what are you selling
them for? I don't think
you gave us a price.

00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:19,045
Yeah, so, they're sold
for $39.99.
Wow, that's pricey.

00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:20,279
O'Leary: What do they
cost to make?

00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,648
Right now, landed cost
is just under $10,

00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,717
but if we can get
25,000 units,

00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:27,386
we can get it down
to $6.80 landed here.

00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,489
The biggest challenge
for this deal to me is,

00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,790
how do I find the people

00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,792
that have the highest propensity
to buy it...

00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:34,894
Yeah.
...to get my
customer‐acquisition cost down,

00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:38,130
because not everybody
wants this or needs it,

00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:41,234

really want it.
Right.
