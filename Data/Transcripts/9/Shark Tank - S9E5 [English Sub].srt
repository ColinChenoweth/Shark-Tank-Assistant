I'm way taller.

00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:33,760
‐Yeah.
‐You understand what I'm saying?

00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,161
You're telling me
I'm walking around

00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,030
with this problem that
I never realized that I had.

00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,498
And I think
this is for a man

00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,433
who wears his shirt
outside of his pants,

00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,102
so then, of course,
it looks baggy.

00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:43,970
I always wear my shirt
inside my pants.

00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,705
So I think
you're too well‐dressed

00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,207
for most of America,
really.

00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:48,541
If you look
at clothes now,

00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,210
you could buy a suit
in short, right?

00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,312
I know I wear
a 40 short suit.

00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:53,914
Everything else
is small, medium, large,

00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,215
and it's made
for a 6‐foot guy.

00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:57,617
We're selling clothes that
are more everyday and casual ‐‐

00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,386
Steven, I think
it's a very clever idea.

00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:01,588
I think you guys
are doing a good job.
Thank you.

00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,557
Not really my line of clothing.

00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:07,527
It doesn't fit me.
I'm out.

00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:08,862
Thank you.

00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:10,530
We have clothes
that guys love.

00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,300
We have 900 happy customers
that want to buy more shirts.

00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,769
So it's about financing
enough to meet that demand

00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,437
and preparing
for new products.

00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,905
And we haven't
even talked

00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,041
about things like
jeans, chinos, shorts...

00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,310

right?

00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,412
‐Exactly.

You're doing
everything right.

00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:30,650
But for me, I don't think
I'm the right partner for you,

00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,086
so for that reason,
I'm going out.

00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:34,254
Thank you.

00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,356
We've looked at brands
like Destination XL

00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:38,358
and Lane Bryant,
who really led the way

00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:40,460
for plus‐size women
and big‐and‐tall men.

00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,562
You have plus‐size women
and petite women.

00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:45,098
You have big‐and‐tall men,
and then there's nothing,

00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:46,967
even though a third of us
are short.

00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:51,171
I'm puzzled
on how to market it accurately.

00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:53,907
And, you know, I think it's
an emotional thing, as well.

00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:55,575
I don't want to accept
the fact

00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,544
that I need
special clothes, probably.

00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:58,778
But you still need them.

00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:01,915
This is not for me.
I'm out.

00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,850

We're sold out,

and guys continually come to us
wanting to buy shirts.

00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,526
And again, the biggest challenge
is inventory.

00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,662
Once we get more inventory in,
we know we can do it.

I think there's a niche
opportunity there.

00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:27,640
I'll make you an offer
12.5% is not enough.

00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,645
I'm gonna have to get 25%,
but I'll offer you $150,000.

00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:35,515
‐For 25%?
‐Right, for the 25%.

00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,650
So that's my offer.
It's not a negotiation.

00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,919
It's not a "Let me see
what Kevin has to say."

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,655
It's a yes‐or‐no conversation.

Those are add‐ons.

00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,368
‐What's the highest package?
‐$3,650.

00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:25,805
Is it mainly weddings,
bar mitzvahs, festive type of...

00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,908
So, our core business model
has been live events.

00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,978
We've busted our butts
for three years now 24/7.

00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,080
‐It's just been the two of us.
‐All on the West Coast, right?

00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,581
‐All over the country.
‐No, right now ‐‐

00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:36,649
We work all over
the U. S.

00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,950
You package this up,
you ship it?

00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,752
We take it on a plane
with us, yeah.

00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:41,821
Herjavec: Sean, you did
$1.4 million with 9.

00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:42,989
How do you do more?

00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,891
If you had more machines,
would you sell more?

00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:46,526
Absolutely. I mean,
that's also why we're here.

00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:47,527
We need more machines,

00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:48,795
we need marketing,
we need sales.

00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:50,830
On a Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
we are at capacity.

00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,066
We can't meet demand right now.
So Monday Tuesday, Wednesday,
they're not being used.

00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:54,367
We can't meet
the demand you have.

00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:56,202
‐No, we cannot meet demand.
‐We're telling people no.

00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,271
‐What does a machine cost?
‐The machine would cost $22,000.

00:13:58,271 --> 00:13:59,439
Ouch.

00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,474
And how much money did you raise
to start this?

00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:02,842
We didn't.
It's all personal.

00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,677
‐It's all your own money?
‐Yeah, I mean ‐‐

00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,646
‐How much did you put up?
‐Uh... [ Chuckles ]

00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:08,715
It's kind of funny ‐‐
I mean, we think $250,000.

00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:10,183
We think it's a little more
than that.

00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,484
We stopped counting
at $250,000.

00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:12,852
You came up
with the right lighting

00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,087
so people have
a good experience.
Sure.

00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:15,254
That's a win, right?

00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:17,357
That's what matters
at the end of the day.

00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,325
‐But as a potential investor...
‐Sure.

00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:20,693
...I'm not getting a sense

00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,229
that there were any unique
filters that were in there.

00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:24,630
‐Right?
‐It's one filter.

00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,032
Right, well,
that's what I'm saying, right?

00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,200
We're producing
500 events a year.

00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,468
We're taking care
of our families.

00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:30,069
We're putting food
on the table.
And good for you.

00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:31,971
What is the thing that you have
that's so valuable?
This.

00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,139
‐What?
‐Demand.

00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:34,974
‐High quality and ‐‐
‐High quality and demand.

00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:37,009
We can't meet demand.
We're in four markets.

00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,278
Yeah, but this is something
other people can replicate.

00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:40,913
If somebody can replicate it
that easy,

00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,815
why haven't they done it
in the last five years?

00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,283
Okay, you've developed
one filter.

00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:45,752
That's all your IP,
or what else?

00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,188
O'Leary:
There is competition,

00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,823
but what I'm trying
to figure out

00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,425
is just the return
on investment.

00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:55,161
Right now,
we're making $400,000 pre‐tax.

00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:56,529
You get my $350,000.

00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:59,132
What does the next
12 months look like?

00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:01,067
Well, one, we would scale
just live events.

00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:01,968
That's simple.

00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:03,236
We would double
that quickly.

00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,505
Venues is where we want to go,
and this is where ‐‐

00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:06,606
Different business.

00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:07,740
It is a different business,

00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,275
and again,
that's why we're here.

00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,177
We clearly have a skill set,
an expertise...

00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:13,246
Do you think I'm gonna pay you
at the Mavs' arena

00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,647
‐to come in and do this?
‐Yes.

00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:15,581
No.

00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,916
Why would they pay you?

00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,085
We feel differently
because we are in conversations

00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,354
with some of the biggest
retailers in the world.

00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:22,422
Look, congratulations.

00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:23,623
I'm not trying
to take away anything

00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:25,191
from what
you've accomplished.
Sure.

00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:27,160
It's more about what I see
in terms of an investment.

00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,394
Right?

00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,096
It's expensive and complicated,
and lot of people

00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,632
are gonna use that as an entree
into this business.

00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,300
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,002
Okay.
Sorry to hear that, Mark.

00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:38,838
I really love this product,
and Mark is talking about it

00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:40,840
from more
technical geek side, right?

00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,075
I'm talking about it
from a consumer side.

00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:46,179
So I love this product,
but I notice myself ‐‐

00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:48,648
Every other day,
I buy a new gadget

00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:50,917
in regards to taking
a picture.

00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,218
But what I'm saying is,

00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:54,153
I'm always
finding something new,

00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,956
and this market changes so fast
that I'm just afraid

00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,425
that you may have a good run
for three years,

00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,961
five years and change with it,
or you may not.

00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,797
The market's just moving
too fast for me, so I'm out.

00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,466
Sorry to hear about that.

00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,401
I don't really see
how this works

00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:10,670
in the stadium
and event arena like that

00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,506
because I think people
are engaged in the event more

00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:16,409
than they're gonna go find
in a corner at your booth.

00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:18,478
If you had said
you want to blow this up

00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,313
for parties, weddings,
be premium,

00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:23,182
the Cadillac or the Mercedes
of this, I would have been in.

00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,651
But because of the direction
you want to take it,

00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,687
‐I'm going out.
‐But I think it's both.

00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:30,556
I'm sorry to hear that 'cause
it's actually both, but...

00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:33,659
How do I get my dough back
if I'm just a 10% shareholder?

00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,395
Well, I think I could actually
get your money back

00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:39,131
just by expanding core business
and doubling that

00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:40,500
in 12 to 18 months.

00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,302
All of the concerns about
changing technology will occur.

00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,338
There's also a wedding
next Sunday,

00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,673
and somebody is gonna pay
for this thing.

00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:51,110
I look at it as a company
that can support debt,

00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,578
so here's an offer.

00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,180
You don't have to take it,
but I'm not sure

00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,249
you're gonna get anything else.
That's always a good sign,
right?

00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,951
"You don't have to take it."
No, because I don't
want to take the risk of being

00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:01,787
a minority shareholder
with no exit.

00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:06,559
I'll loan you $350,000
at 18% interest.

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,328
I want 5% equity
in the company

00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:12,231
as a fee for providing
that line.

00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,534
‐It's the Loan Shark Tank again.
‐No, it isn't.

00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,469
If you have a better structure,
Robert, you should provide it.

00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,804
‐Are you done, Mr. O'Leary?
‐I'm not finished yet.

00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:19,939
There's more?

00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:22,141
I happen to think
you have to run like hell,

00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,110
and I think
the more machines you get,

00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,378
the more cash you'll make.

00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,446
I'd be very careful
with your assumptions

00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:28,714
about those other venues.

00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,716
What I'd like to see
is you put them in a couple,

00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,084
‐prove out your theory.
‐Sure.

00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,886
Meanwhile, you're doing
weddings, my friend.

00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,689
I love the business.
It's fantastic.

00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:39,759
‐I'm with you on the venues.
‐Thank you.

00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,727
I agree with Kevin
in that you got to run.

00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,131
You got to go to every market.
Oh, we absolutely agree.
That's why we're standing here.

00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:47,400
I mean, we've turned down money
to be right here, right now.

00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,401
You got to go fast.

00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,102
I really like
the corporate idea.

00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:51,871
I think that's
gonna be really big.

00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,005
But I need more equity.

00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,373
How do I get more equity?

00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:55,575
Well, what's your offer?

00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:56,642
I need more than 10%.

00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:57,777
How much do you need?

00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:59,712
‐[ Chuckles ]
‐I'd love to have 50%.

00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:00,680
‐50%?
‐Yeah.

00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,314
‐Whoa.
‐What?

00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,725
Narrator:
Three Sharks are out.

00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:15,161
Sean and Ryan
are seeking $350,000

00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:18,698
for 10% of their premium
photo booth company, Mirmir.

00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:22,068
They have one offer from Kevin,
but Robert is also interested.

00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:23,302
I'd love to have 50%.

00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,136
‐50%?
‐Yeah.

00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:25,404
‐Whoa.
‐What?

00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,440
A full partnership.
Would you do a full partnership?

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,108
‐Why would you do that?
‐We wouldn't.

00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,744
Well, I'm just asking.
Well, you're valuing
the business at $700,000.

00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:33,446
No, I'm not asking
for that dollar amount.

00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,880
What dollar amount
would you need?

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,549
At 50%?
I couldn't do a deal at 50%.

00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:38,017
‐You couldn't?
‐No.

00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:39,619
‐Oh, hell no.
‐At 50%?

00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,787
'Cause we're churning out cash.
There is no way I'm gonna ‐‐ No.

00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,322
John: I'm just asking
a question. Why not?

00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:44,624
It was just a question.

00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,826
I just wanted to know,
what would you sell 50% for?

00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:47,994
I mean, we think ‐‐

00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:50,329
We think it's more valuable
than that.

00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,732
‐You asked for $350,000 for 10%.
‐Right.

00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:55,768
Meaning the entire thing
is worth $3.5 million today.

00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:56,969
Right.

00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,104
He doesn't want to sell
a control position.

00:18:58,104 --> 00:18:59,305
I think he's made it clear.

00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:00,506
Okay.

00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,208
I mean, I'm happy
to entertain more equity.

00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:05,311
I think we're gonna explode.
I think we're gonna get big.

00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,847
What's the most equity
you would sell today?

00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:12,852
For the right dollar amount,

00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:14,887
I would entertain
maybe 18% to 20%,

00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:16,422
but that's on the high side.

00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:18,057
Would you do 20% for $700,000?

00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:20,593
Same valuation, just more equity
for the same price?
Yes.

00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:22,995
20% for $700,000.

00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,363
I think
I would do that, yes.

00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,799
Because it would allow me
to expand even that much faster.

00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:32,004
I'll give you $700,000
for 20%.

00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,709

"Well, what if I go out,
I apply for the patents,

and we just signed a deal
with Houzz.

00:26:32,658 --> 00:26:34,093
So, what do you do
full time,

00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:36,728
'cause obviously $31,000
isn't gonna pay the bills.

the company?

00:26:40,866 --> 00:26:41,733

you're making money.

your margins are good.

The real issue
about getting this

00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,922
in broad distribution
is getting the packaging right

00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:06,225
to tell the story
of what this does...

00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:08,393
Right.
...which is gonna be
one challenge.

00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:11,630
And then getting a distributor
that sells curtain rods.

00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,599
‐Right.
‐Sell them together...

00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:15,834
But the trouble is,
you're a full‐time ‐‐

00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:18,036
and thank you again
for your service ‐‐

00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:19,238
police officer.

00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:21,073
This is not a crazy deal.

00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:23,542
It's not overvalued
or anything.

00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:26,278
It's just ‐‐
Who's gonna do the work?

00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:27,713
You're looking at him.

00:27:27,713 --> 00:27:31,116
Me running this business
is the one last link to my dad.

00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:33,785
This business
meant everything to my dad,

00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:36,488
and this makes me
still feel close to him.

00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,291
So I would retire
from the police department

00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:40,659
to run this business.

00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:41,894
Wow.

00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:44,730
Then I got to ask you
a question.

00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:49,034
Are you motivated to do this
because it's in his honor,

00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:52,638
or do you really
want to grow this business?

00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:54,706
Because those are two
different things.

00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:56,508
I'm passionate
about the business

00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,077
because it was started
by my father and my mother,

00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:01,813
and this is the only thing
that she has left of my dad.

00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:04,149
This is the only thing
I have left of my dad.

00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:06,685
So this is basically
everything for us.

00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,388
Would you have the same
motivation to go on

00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:11,456
with sales
of $30,000, $40,000?

00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:12,958
You can't live off that.

00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:14,960
But, Kevin,
with all due respect,

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,362
this is only with me
doing this part‐time.

00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:21,633
If I had a Shark behind me
with the marketing and exposure,

00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:23,702
I have doubt in my mind
that this thing could blow up.

00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,038
Derrek, it wouldn't take off
the way you would expect it to.

00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:28,307
Because there's still
blocking and tackling
that has to take place.

00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:29,508
‐Right.
‐Right?

00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:32,611
And so while what you've
accomplished is phenomenal,

00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:34,680
what your dad
has accomplished,

00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,516
but at the same time,
you're not investable yet

00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:40,219
because you're still
figuring all this out.

00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,154
I don't think you're ready,

00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:44,923
and honestly,
it's not my wheelhouse,

00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:47,392
it's not really my strong suit,
these types of products.

00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,894
So, for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:50,629
Thank you.

00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:52,030
Thank you.

00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,599
I mean, look, people have been
doubting me my whole life.

00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:55,434
People told me
that I would never make it

00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:56,702
through Marine Corps boot camp,

00:28:56,702 --> 00:28:57,869
told me I didn't have
what it took,

00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:59,271
said I was too small.

00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:02,374
I served four years honorably
as a United States Marine,

00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:05,344
and I earned a Navy &amp; Marine
Corps achievement medal.

00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:07,679
People said I would
never become a cop,

00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,147
said it was not possible.

00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:12,384
I've been on the police force
now for almost five years.

00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:14,286
I continue to chase
my dreams.

00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:15,354
Good for you.

00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:17,522
To honor your father
is beautiful thing,

00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:19,057
and you've already done it.

00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:21,026
‐You're you.
‐Right.

00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:22,461
So I think here,

00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:26,198
I would take pause and stop
and think about ‐‐

00:29:26,198 --> 00:29:29,368
Is this the life that you
want to live day to day?

00:29:29,368 --> 00:29:32,037
‐Because it's a huge commitment.
‐Right.

00:29:32,037 --> 00:29:33,605
You have four patents.

00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,774
To me,
it's a licensing play.

00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:36,708
Right.

00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,777
And getting somebody
to buy that

00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,580
and then they actually
have the manpower

00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,482
to put it everywhere, to me,

00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:46,918
would be the greatest
legacy your father ever had.

00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:47,919
Right.

00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,223
And, for me,
I know what it would take ‐‐

00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:52,824
I mean, it's huge.

00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:55,494
It's a huge
amount of effort.

00:29:55,494 --> 00:29:59,431
For those reasons,
I personally need to be out.

00:29:59,431 --> 00:30:00,666
Thank you.

00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:02,634
There's a theory out there
that "I need to quit my job

00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,770
and I need to just go,
you know, all out,"

00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,105
and what you do is then
you can't pay the bills

00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:10,108
and then you can't put
any money into the business.
Mm‐hmm.

00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:11,476
You need to run
this business,

00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,612
but I don't think you need
to quit your job, either.

00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:15,447
It wouldn't be
in your best interest

00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:17,916
for me to help because you need
to slowly grow this,

00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:21,219
‐so I'm out.
‐Thank you.

00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:24,222
The right path here
is going to find

00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:27,993
that licensing deal
that Lori suggested to you.

00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:29,161
Right.

00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:32,597
You want to make him proud,
go get a royalty check

00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:36,535
of $50,000 a month,
because you have these patents.

00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:37,969
Right.

00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:39,404
That's the gift
he really left you.
You have four.

00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:40,672
Right. Right.

00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:43,875
It's one of those deals that
it's just a beautiful story,

00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:46,878
but as a business,
extremely hard to invest in.

00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:49,147
I'm sorry, Derrek,
I'm out.

00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:53,085
Derrek, I love the dream,
and you have great purpose.

00:30:53,085 --> 00:30:56,655
Great businesses are started
with great purpose.

00:30:56,655 --> 00:31:02,361
You know, my dad was thrown
in jail 23 times,

00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:04,730
and, uh,
when I was 21 years old,

00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:05,664
I was, uh ‐‐

00:31:05,664 --> 00:31:08,100
I didn't know
what I wanted to do.

00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,103
I was a bit of a mess,
partying, hanging out.

00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:13,105
People would say, "What do you
want to do with your life?"

00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:15,273
I'd go,
"Eh, it doesn't matter."

00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:17,676
My dad sits down with me
and he says,

00:31:17,676 --> 00:31:20,379
"I went through hell
so that you

00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:23,582
could have the opportunity
I never had."

00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:26,685
That was it.
That was it.

00:31:26,685 --> 00:31:28,487
And for the rest of my life,
people always said,

00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:29,554
"Oh, how do you work so hard?

00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,890
You only sleep
three hours a day."

00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,225
It must be hard.

00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:36,395
And I always used to say,
"Anything I do in lifetime

00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:39,798
will never be as hard
as what that man went through."

00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:45,470
But you've got to have something
that you can apply that to

00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,672
in order to build
a bigger business.

00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:49,608
I wouldn't quit
the job today.

00:31:49,608 --> 00:31:51,710
The price point
is just too small.

00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,678
But maybe
you'll figure it out.

00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:56,515
I can't be in today,
but I wish you all the best.

00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:57,816
I'm out.

00:31:57,816 --> 00:31:59,584
Thank you all for your time.

00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,652
Derrek,
can I shake your hand?

00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:01,686
‐Sure.
‐Thank you very much.

00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:02,854
My pleasure.
Thank you very much.

00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:04,055
‐Wish you all the best.
‐Thank you.

00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:05,424
‐Thank you very much.
‐Congrats, Derrek.

00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:07,325
‐Thank you, guys.
‐Thank you, Derrek.

00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:08,960
That's a good guy,
right there.

00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,595
Derrek:
Yeah, I'm disappointed.

00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,330
I got a little
knocked down today,

00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,232
but my dad never gave up
on this product,

00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:15,333
and neither will I.

00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:18,537
I'm going to definitely
prove them wrong.

00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:20,972
It's hard to look at that
and not want to help him,

00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:23,442
but you realize
it's not a business.
It's small.

00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:25,177
It's not
that he's not a business.

00:32:25,177 --> 00:32:26,945
He's just not ready.
It's just small.
It's hard.

00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,313
Right?
He'll figure it out.

00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:30,148
He's got time.
He's just here too early.

00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:32,250

00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:16,121
‐Hey!
‐Okay!

00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:18,290
‐Hey!
‐Hot models everywhere.

00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,691
You guys were quiet!

00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:21,993
With the Scuttlebutt,
you can float in it,

00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:24,229
you can float on it,
or you can sit on it

00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,731
for all your floatation
and recreational needs.

00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:27,966
Also, our Bottoms Up,

00:34:27,966 --> 00:34:30,035
you can use it
for all your watersports needs.

00:34:30,035 --> 00:34:32,771
And then when you're done,
you simply flip it upside down,

00:34:32,771 --> 00:34:35,674
jump in the water for a full day
of relaxation and floatation.

00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:36,841
And when you add in

00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:38,710
all the extra Scuttlebutt
configurations,

00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,744
you and your friends

00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,680
you're in for a good day
on the water,

00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,149
and you won't be getting water
in your drink

00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:45,450
wearing these bad boys.

00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:48,353
Sharks, our products
are the all‐in‐one, get‐it‐done,

00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:50,655
have‐fun‐in‐the‐sun,
slam‐dunk, home‐run,

00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:52,857
best floatation
devices on the market.

00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:54,059
So, Sharks...

00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:56,094
Together: Who wants to join
our float club?

00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,496
O'Leary:
I've got a lake house.

00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:01,132
I've got a few
of the chair things.

00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:02,934
They're made out of foam.

00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,670
They're very inexpensive.
How much does that one cost?

00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:09,074
So, we sell these for $65,
and the vest, we sell for $90.

00:35:09,074 --> 00:35:11,776
How much does it cost you
to make each one?

00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,912
The Bottoms Up
dual‐purpose vest

00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:16,348
we get for $27.80,
including shipping.

00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:19,417
The Scuttlebutt triple‐purpose,
we get for $22.80.

00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,720
So, let's understand
your business.

00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,154
How many have you sold?

00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:25,123
So, to date,
we sold $63,000

00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,692
and we've been selling
for three years.

00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:28,526
‐Oh!
‐Whoa.

00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:29,761
That may not sound great.

00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:30,996
You're right,
it doesn't.

00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:33,131
I know, but we started
the production of this

00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,566
and the idea six years ago,

00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:37,002
and it took us two to three
years just in the development,

00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:39,137
working back and forth
with the manufacturer.

00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,438
Right.

00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:42,707
And the patent process
and the Coast Guard process

00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:44,943
alone has been
a three‐year ordeal.

00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:47,579
Why only $63,000 in sales
over three years?

00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:50,382
About three years ago,
we're like, "Oh, my God!

00:35:50,382 --> 00:35:53,051
We're gonna go
for every big‐box retailer."

00:35:53,051 --> 00:35:55,620
And we went to them,
and they were like, "We love it!

00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,955
Is it Coast Guard approved?"

00:35:56,955 --> 00:35:58,223
No.

00:35:58,223 --> 00:36:00,025
"All right, guys, well, come
back and see us when it is."

00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:01,860
The challenge is gonna be
demonstrating it,

00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,428
because people
are gonna look at it,

00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:04,863
and maybe
you have a hang tag,

00:36:04,863 --> 00:36:07,165
but you're gonna have to have
a point‐of‐purchase display.

00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,800
There's just so much
expense involved.

00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,001
Well, that sounds
like a nightmare.

00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,336
‐I don't like that.
‐No, that's right.

00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,805
My two cents is you're gonna
have to do that online,

00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:15,807
you know, when people
are looking to make

00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:17,008
those purchase decisions.

00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,476
‐Too small a market.
‐Yeah, it's too small.

00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,078
Well, maybe the market's
not as huge, but look,

00:36:20,078 --> 00:36:21,479
one of the worst things
that could happen

00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:22,781
is you get a big order
from a big box

00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:24,382
and it doesn't sell
and you're out of business.

00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:26,685
You know, the funny thing
about your deal,

00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,153
I got to be honest with you,

00:36:28,153 --> 00:36:30,221
is I spend all of my time
in the lake

00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:33,792
in one of those foam chairs
with a bottle of Chardonnay.
[ Laughs ]

00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:35,794
And I sit around
and direct traffic

00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:38,329
when my kids are going
in and out of the boats.

00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:40,465
I'm like the traffic cop
in the chair.

00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:43,435
I am definitely gonna buy
one of these, but I'm trying ‐‐

00:36:43,435 --> 00:36:45,804
Would you float around in it
or your chair?

00:36:45,804 --> 00:36:48,473
Well, the trouble
with the chair, actually, is ‐‐

00:36:48,473 --> 00:36:50,442
This is better,
because the chair,

00:36:50,442 --> 00:36:52,577
you have to actually
balance yourself,

00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:54,913
and the more you drink,
the worse it gets.

00:36:54,913 --> 00:36:57,582
So I just ‐‐
The thing about "Shark Tank"

00:36:57,582 --> 00:37:00,118
is you get nailed
on the real problem.

00:37:00,118 --> 00:37:01,252
This thing is ‐‐

00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:02,620
It's a great product.

00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,023
It's gonna be hanging
in the marina.

00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:06,424
Who's gonna know
what it is?

00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:08,493
I think by literally
hanging it upside‐down...

00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:10,161
I mean,
as they're flipping through,

00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:13,131
most of them are on a rack.
I would say the idiot kid
at the store

00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:14,899
hung the thing upside down
by mistake.

00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,301
It's actually detailed by ‐‐

00:37:16,301 --> 00:37:18,636
One things entrepreneurs
always have to learn

00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:20,772
is when it's your product,
you just think

00:37:20,772 --> 00:37:22,974
everybody's focused on it
and you perceive

00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:25,577
"This is how I would do it
if I were the customer."

00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:26,745
It's never that way.

00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:29,047
You always have to perceive
that your customer

00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:30,815
doesn't care
about your product.

00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:32,183
You have to make them care.

00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:34,986
And to that avail, I would say
that's why we're here.

00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:36,087
We're creative guys.

00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,156
We've pushed this thing
for six years,

00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:40,391
and we're ready
for a strategic investor.

00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:43,228
I'll make you an offer.

00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:45,563
I'll give you $120,000
for 33.3%.

00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,306
Narrator:
All Sharks are still in.

00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:58,877
Doug and Justin have an offer
on the table from Kevin O'Leary

00:37:58,877 --> 00:38:01,846
for the multi‐functional
life vest, Human Bobber.

00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:04,349
I'll make you an offer.

00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:06,317
I'll give you $120,000
for 33.3%.

00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,155
That's actually
a really good offer.

00:38:10,155 --> 00:38:12,423
Will we be entertaining
anyone else's offers?

00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:14,225
I don't think
I'm gonna have a lot

00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:16,961
of competition on this one,
I got to be honest with you.

00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:17,862
[ Laughs ]

00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:19,931
I'm basically paying $120,000

00:38:19,931 --> 00:38:23,034
for a life jacket
I can float and drink in.

00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:24,302
That's about it.

00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,371
Cuban: See, here's where
my head's at.

00:38:26,371 --> 00:38:28,706
One, I've got a great deal
with Amazon Exclusives.

00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:30,742
Right? I have my own
Amazon Exclusive page.

00:38:30,742 --> 00:38:32,043
We can get you
your own.

00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:35,346
Two, Tower Paddle Board
is an online marketing machine.

00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:37,215
But then,
on the flip side,

00:38:37,215 --> 00:38:40,118
the untold secret
of "Shark Tank" Season 8 now

00:38:40,118 --> 00:38:41,619
is that having done this

00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,788
and having
71 "Shark Tank" deals,

00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:47,058
I already know that your
accounting's gonna be a mess,

00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:50,228
that I'm gonna have to come in
and clean you all up,

00:38:50,228 --> 00:38:51,763
and I'm so sick and tired

00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:54,265
of babysitting companies
at that level.

00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:56,668
You guys don't even have
an income statement, right?

00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:59,003
I mean,
it's a spreadsheet.

00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,105
Let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:03,241
QuickBooks
was way too expensive.

00:39:03,241 --> 00:39:05,743
Well, you know,
I think it's very clever.

00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:07,312
You did a better mousetrap

00:39:07,312 --> 00:39:09,781
on something
that's been kind of boring.

00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:11,783
But sometimes,
investing in business,

00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:14,285
to me, feels almost like
a poker game, you know?

00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:17,021
You don't know what's the next
card that's gonna come.

00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,858
And, to me, you're either
all in or you fold.

00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:22,460
And I'm looking at this
and I'm thinking

00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,928
I'm gonna have to fold.

00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:26,831
You're just starting,
so I'm out.

00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:28,766
‐Thank you very much.
‐Thank you.

00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:31,936
It's gonna be very difficult
to build a company around this.

00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:34,272
This is a feature
to an existing product.

00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:36,975
Everybody buys
one life jacket.

00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:40,545
People are not gonna buy
another life jacket

00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:43,181
even if you can float
into it.

00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:47,218
The path to riches in this
is to license it

00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:51,823
so that it is the only
life jacket that people buy.

00:39:51,823 --> 00:39:54,692
It's not a company today.
I'm out.

00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:56,895
We look at,
where's the opportunity,

00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:58,963
but then where
is the distribution

00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:01,933
and the pipeline that you
can tap into that we have?

00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:04,869
Even if I go to my guys
over at Bass Pro,

00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:06,404
I can't support them.

00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,840
I can't push people
into retail,

00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,576
and if you can't
help support retail,

00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:13,278
then you end up failing.

00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:14,846
So, in this instance,

00:40:14,846 --> 00:40:18,516
I wouldn't be able to help
distribute it, so I'm out.

00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:21,653
Well, you have an offer
on the table ‐‐ Kevin's.

00:40:21,653 --> 00:40:24,022
Yes, we do,
and it's a great offer.

00:40:24,022 --> 00:40:25,723
And Mark hasn't
made up his mind.

00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:27,058
Are you looking
at this?

00:40:27,058 --> 00:40:29,360
Okay, I'll consider helping
Kevin, but let me ‐‐

00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,396
I'll let you guys
convince Kevin of this.

00:40:31,396 --> 00:40:32,964
Why would anybody
help Kevin?

00:40:32,964 --> 00:40:34,465
Because I want
to help them.

00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:35,633
You asked for 33.3%?

00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:37,936
I got to have
at least that, yeah.
That's fine.

00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:40,271
10% of that goes to me,
and I'll hook them up

00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,606
with the Amazon Exclusives

00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,741
and connect them
with Tower Paddle Board

00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:45,443
and let them use
my back office

00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,745
'cause I know
their accounting sucks, right?

00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:49,380
Yeah, look,
that makes sense.

00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,182
Guys, this is such
a great deal.

00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:53,318
But, Kevin,
I'm not putting in any cash.

00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:55,119
[ Laughs ]

00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,554
So you want me
to fund your 10%?

00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:58,656
Yes, because ‐‐
I don't have to make
that decision now.

00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:00,191
Mark, when did you lose
all your money?

00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:01,793
You need Kevin to fund you?

00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,428
Look, I'm not gonna do that.

00:41:03,428 --> 00:41:05,463
I got to wet my beak.
[ Laughs ]

00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,633
Mark, In eight years, I never
thought I would see this happen.

00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:10,001
Kevin has to pay your way.

00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:11,002
That's not gonna happen.

00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:12,537
But, look,
at the end of the day ‐‐

00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:14,339
It's worth it,
so you have to convince him.

00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:15,840
So, Kevin, how much
of the company

00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,408
are you willing
to offer Mark for ‐‐

00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:18,876
None.
Everybody pays in my world.

00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:20,845
Everybody gets paid
in mine.

00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:23,081
Justin and Doug,
here's the deal.

00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:26,084
Put $120,000 up
for 33.3%.

00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:28,419
But Cuban's a partner
on this with me,

00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:30,121
and he's getting paid equity.

00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:31,356
So he gets 10%.

00:41:31,356 --> 00:41:33,891
And you understand
the 10% that Mark is getting

00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:36,627
is coming from you,
so I'm funding the company

00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:38,329
‐for 33.3%.
‐43.3% total.

00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,464
And 10% is your...

00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:41,032
That's my number.

00:41:41,032 --> 00:41:42,934
What are you gonna do?

00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:47,005
Well, we appreciate
the offers,

00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:50,908
and as crazy
as it may sound,

00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:52,510
we're gonna take the offer
'cause we want to see

00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,811
this thing go somewhere.
‐Smart man!

00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:55,613
We've been at it
for six years, man.
Smart man.

00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:57,015
We want to see it
turn into something.

00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:58,249
‐Appreciate it.
‐Congrats, guys.

00:41:58,249 --> 00:41:59,584
‐Wow.
‐Appreciate it, Mark.

00:41:59,584 --> 00:42:01,219
Congrats.
You got to leave
one of these here for me.

00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:02,487
‐Mark, thanks a lot.
‐Thanks, guys.

00:42:02,487 --> 00:42:03,955
‐Appreciate it.
‐Thanks for all that time.

00:42:03,955 --> 00:42:05,056
‐Bye, guys.
‐All right.

00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:05,857
Congrats.

00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:07,358
Yeah, dude!

00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,760
[ Laughs ]

00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,328
That's how we bob!

00:42:10,328 --> 00:42:11,863
That's how we bob!

00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:13,664
So, I'm pretty sure
we just gave up

00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:15,166
10% of our company
for free,

00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:17,001
and that may be
a "Shark Tank" first.

00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,437
And it sounded pretty crazy
when we first heard it,

00:42:19,437 --> 00:42:21,706
but I think it's gonna pay off
in the long run.

00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:23,307
Having two Sharks
on our team,

00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:25,710
we're gonna be able to take
this company sky high.
