"How the heck are these guys
making money?"

00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,412
Well,
the answer is advertising.

00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:55,482
To put it simply,
companies pay us to display ads,

00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:58,385
and our customers contribute
by driving those ads around.

00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:01,622
Each of our cars is equipped
with a vinyl advertising wrap,

00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:04,958
as well as a military‐grade,
dual‐sided LCD display

00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,828
that can display
dynamic ad content.

00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:13,934
This means we can show ads
based on time, GPS location,

00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:16,470
or really any other factors
that we choose.

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,339
Signing up to drive

You know, I'm amazed you said
"five months ago,"

because I have actually seen
WaiveCars in Santa Monica.

00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,177
Yeah, our home base
is in Santa Monica.

00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,046

Corcoran: Do you return it
to the same place

00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,020

No, so, right now,

00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,855
you have to return it
in the city of Santa Monica.

00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,091
Anywhere?
Any public meter.

Yeah.

00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:15,462
So, every time
you start a booking,

00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:17,064
we require the users to do
a quick check

00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:19,700
that the car's clean,
that there's no body damage...

00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,134
What's your break‐even
per car?

00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,536
Well, so,
the cost of the car itself

00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,538
is about $1,000 a month
with insurance and everything.

00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,373
Our break‐even will be
about $1,500.

00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:27,574
Over that is profit.

00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:30,143
We actually have done
zero dollars in marketing,

00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,446
and we have 4,300 users

00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:33,747
just in our
first five months.
Wow!

00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:36,083
Look, it's got to be
capitally intensive, right?

00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,517
So,
how much have you raised?

00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:38,952
We raised $1.3 million.

00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,388
When would you expect
to make a profit?

00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:44,157
So, it really depends on the
amount of cars we have, right?

00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:46,226
If we're selling out
our 20 cars right now

00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,761
at $5,000 per car,

00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,996
we'd be making about
$1.2 million in revenue.

00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:52,499
We'd be walking away
with about $300,000 in profit.

00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:53,667
Now,
those aren't great margins.

00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,669
Once we move to 200 cars,

00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:57,904
we'd be doing
$12 million in revenue,

00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,407
so we'd be walking away
with $800,000‐and‐change profit.

00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,542
Do you have guys have
some unfair advantage?

00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,711
Are you better at something
than everybody else?

00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,947
So, the screen
that we have on our cars,

00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:08,081
a lot of people
kind of overlook.

00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,249
"Oh, it's a screen.
Whatever."

00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,785
This is actually
crazy custom‐engineered

00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,120
for this vehicle.

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,821
You can't slap this
on any other vehicle.

00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,256
It has to be
safety‐ and crash‐tested,

00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,991
and the manufacturer
that has this

00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,960
has over 200 patents
on the display.

00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,695
And we have an
exclusive agreement with them.

00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:23,029
Guys, look,
I like the idea.

00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,599
I think you guys have
a chance at success.

00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,200
But the challenge
for me is,

00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,871
the variability of advertising
is crazy.

00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:33,540
You know, it's hard for
traditional media companies

00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,041
to sell advertising.

00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,811
There's video boards
that are popping up

00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:40,480
on top of hot‐dog stands
in New York, right?
Yeah.

00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,515
They're everywhere.

00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:43,283
The inventory
is being saturated,

00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,484
which hurts your rate.

00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,087
The more you spend,
the more you need.

00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,923
And, you know, that's gotten
a lot of industries in trouble.

00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:51,858

I'm out.

00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,402

that's a proprietary sign,

00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:07,007
but I'm sure that somebody
can figure out

00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:09,676
another kind of sign
to put on top of a car.

00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:12,779
I'm concerned that other people
can take your model,

00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,748

I'm out.

Why doesn't Uber advertise
right now?

00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:19,679

worth millions of dollars.

I don't think there's any way
you guys survive this,

because I have yet to see
anything you do better

00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,786
than anybody else
on the planet.

I think you've already heard
what Sacca says ‐‐

that you have nothing

can't just emulate
and crush you

after you've proven
that it works.

00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,435
That's a concern
for any investor.

00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,204
Secondly, I know a lot
about the advertising business

00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:19,839

a lot in it.

I don't know
if this is gonna work or not.

So, that's another risk.

00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:29,115

Instead of 4%,

So, is it...
I'm exclusively on Pearachute
right now.

00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,626
But it's not growing anymore,
is it?

00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:47,794
It's actually doing
really well,

00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:49,095
and it's pivoted
into a new market because ‐‐

00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:51,030
you know what I learned
from the experience there,

00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,832
which honestly, I think,
a benefit to you all,

00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,001
is that I spent eight years
learning on someone else's dime

00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,736
what I can now accelerate
into this business.

00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:58,738
I want to know,
did you get whacked?

00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:00,373
I ‐‐ The truth is that

00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:02,342
I watched a competitor
just blow past us,

00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,043
and I realized
that the founder vision

00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,579
that I brought only took ‐‐
had so much value at that point,

00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,181
and it was time for me
to exit the business.

00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,516
So, I found a CEO that was
a great operator

00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,617
and brought him in,

00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,920
and I handed over
a very healthy business.

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,455
Good for you.
Thank you.

00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:17,490
‐I know it's only 126 days...
‐Yes.

00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,592
...but how much money
have you made?

00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,362
So, to date,
we've made just under $50,000

00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,796
in 126 days and ‐‐

00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,298
And how many subscribers
do you have?

00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:27,066
We have over 600.

00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,701
What was your revenue
last month?

00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,237
The ‐‐ In the last four weeks,
it's been $20,000.

00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:33,439
Tell me how your software
interacts

00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,675
with all these
different classrooms.

00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:37,443
How do you know
about their inventory ‐‐

00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:39,612
what classes are available
and what's not available?

00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,382
So we launched
with 30 partners.

00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,250
We created a very light portal
for them

00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,685
that's actually
mobile‐friendly

00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,353
so their instructors,
when they're on a soccer field

00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:48,654
or in front
of a swimming pool,

00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:51,491
can check kids in
and adjust inventory real‐time.

00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:52,658
So, they can say,

00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,994
"Four people canceled
for our art class today.

00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:56,662
Let's put four more spots
on Pearachute today."

00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,097
O'Leary:
What cities are you in?

00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,565
We're only in Chicago right now,
so...

00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,434
That's it?

00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:02,769
When you look
at what this is

00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:05,071
in terms of a vision
for this business,

00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,740
there is 75 million Millennials
right now

00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,743
that are going to have
another 75 million children...
I agree. I agree.

00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,311
...over the next 20 years.

00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,981
80% of them care more
about experiences

00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:16,749
than they do about things.
But tell me how
you're gonna expand it.

00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,785
I get it. I get it.
How 'bout New York?
No, so the demand is...

00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:19,952
How 'bout Dallas?
How 'bout Miami?
What's happening in ‐‐

00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,654
Yeah, so,
Dallas is actually next.

00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,923
We've already gone out...
But how do you do that?
How do you do that?

00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,425
So ‐‐
How do you do it
before somebody else does it?

00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,126
So, Dallas ‐‐
what we're so excited about is

00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:28,995
the fact that there's
a really high concentration

00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:31,230
of kids' activities centers
in North Dallas.

00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,399
But what's missing,
and I'm still waiting for it,

00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,967
and you better
get to it because

00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:37,503
why are you going
to own this space?

00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:39,806
What ‐‐
What are you going to do

00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:41,340
to create
the number one platform?

00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,609
Why are you gonna be the winner
at the end of the day?

00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,944
Why are you gonna grow?

00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,145
We do plan to take

00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,581
a similar model
that we took to Chicago

00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:50,817
and put it in
the next big cities

00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:52,452
that we think are
a great opportunity.

00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:55,555
I asked you to tell me
how I pour gasoline

00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:58,424
in the form of my money
onto your fire

00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,193
to expand this business.

00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:03,029
I want to know what the path is
to get every other city,

00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:04,597
and you never answered me.

00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:17,643
I asked you to tell me
how I pour gasoline

00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,646
in the form of my money
onto your fire

00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,181
to expand this business.

00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,917
I want to know what the path is
to get every other city,

00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,519
and you never answered me.

00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:29,121
So, the...
That's a huge fail on your part.
I'm sorry.

00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,691
I really ‐‐ I really think that
when you have the opportunity ‐‐
I'm sorry if
I didn't give you ‐‐

00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:34,827
And you speak very quickly.
Let me finish, okay?
[ Laughs ]

00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,095
All right?
‐Yeah.

00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,497
I'm out.

00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:40,967
Sacca: Is there something
you're better at

00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,235
than everybody else?

00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:44,370
I think my differentiator
is, honestly,

00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,672
losing to a competitor
in my last business.

00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,140
Watching some‐‐
That's it?

00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,309
Watching someone else
accelerate past me

00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:52,979
and realizing all the missteps
I'd made over eight years

00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:54,680
when I could've done it
so much faster,

00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,949
so much more aggressively.,
Do you mind if I review
that history a minute?

00:16:56,949 --> 00:17:00,186
'Cause I feel like I'm not
quite sure I got it.
Sure.

00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,355
I'm gonna tell you what I've
been hearing here.
Okay.

00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,957
You started StepForward.
GiveForward.

00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:08,761
But when the going got tough,
you exited.

00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:10,897
That's not what I heard.

00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:12,565
Whoa, whoa. I'm just ‐‐
you can correct me.

00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:13,933
I just want to recite
the history.
Yeah, no, that's fair.

00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:15,701
You know what
really concerns me?

00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,570
It concerns me
what you said earlier,

00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,805
when you said,
"The best part is

00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:23,609
that I learned
on someone else's money."

00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:26,979
I feel like you are probably
a phenomenal facilitator.

00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,315
I just don't think
you're an entrepreneur.

00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:31,150
I don't see you
as a killer.

00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,819
I have never heard that before,
and I have to tell you.
You have to show me ‐‐

00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:36,255
Yeah. Yeah.
Maybe some of my life history
will help shed some light

00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,392
on how I am absolutely gritty
and driven.

00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,994
So, I was born
in Costa Rica.

00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,996
I grew up with a single mom
who didn't go to college,

00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,965
and she said, "Your life is
only gonna be different

00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:47,967
if you work your butt off,"
and so, that's what I did.

00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:49,802
And I worked my butt off
to get a scholarship

00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:51,237
to a private school,
and I ‐‐

00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,472
Sorry.
[ Chuckles, clears throat ]

00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:57,109
This is important ‐‐
tell us.
I wasn't expecting this to be
the challenge, sorry.

00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,178
I went to Yale,
and I worked my butt off there.

00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,747
And I realized at Yale
that it wasn't enough

00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,383
to go to be a lawyer
or an investment banker.

00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:07,453
I ‐‐ If I'm gonna do something
powerful in this life,

00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:08,721
I need to do things
that matter.

00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:10,222
GiveForward
wasn't just like a,

00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:11,991
"Oh, wouldn't it be nice
if this exists?"

00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:14,327
It was, there is a pain point,
and there's a desire for people

00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:16,796
to give individually to people,
and that does not exist.

00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:19,599
And I‐I beat down so many doors
with this idea,

00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,535
and I fought as hard as I could
to make it go well.

00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:24,403
But at the end of the day,
I thought,

00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,238
"Maybe someone else can do this
better than I can."

00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:29,008
But there's a point always
along the way

00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:30,610
in building a business

00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,946
where the chips are down,
nothing's going right,

00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,183
and it's so tempting
to switch horses.

00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,317
I think
there's going to be

00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,686
a learning curve
on this business, as well,

00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,989
and I don't want you learning
on my dime.

00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:44,023
I'm out.

00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,693
I like the idea.

00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:50,229
But, to me,
my concern here is

00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:52,732
I feel like you're biting off
a little bit more

00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:54,634
than you're gonna be able
to chew.

00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:59,238
I would say, get this
grounded better in Chicago.

00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,641
Then, set your sights
moving on to Dallas.

00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:04,310
I wish you the best.
I'm out.

00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:09,515
Hey, Desiree, you know,
I, in the spring of 2000,

00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:13,719
lost every dime I had
plus $2.125 million more,

00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,288
leaving me completely
in the hole with no assets.

00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,658
I was picking up spare work
off of Craigslist

00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:21,494
to try and make rent
so I could stay in the game.

00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,397
And it took me more than
a decade to get up the courage

00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:26,666
to talk about that setback
along the way.

00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,568
I was listening to you
tell your story

00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:32,238
about being born
to a single mother in Costa Rica

00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:35,241
and how you fought your way up
through the system to Yale,

00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:36,542
et cetera.

00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:39,211
Your whole demeanor changed
as an entrepreneur.

00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,047
You found
a confidence in that.

00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:43,683
Instead of coming out here
and asking for money,

00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,118
I saw this whole shift
where you were giving the Sharks

00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:48,054
an opportunity to invest
in your business.

00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:49,255
Keep that in mind.

00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:51,023
Own your journey ‐‐
own what you've learned

00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,892
and why it makes you
so much more powerful

00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:55,795
and why it's equipped you
to be unfairly advantaged

00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:58,431
in this business
to win it.

00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:00,833
If you search hard enough
in California on any given day,

00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,768
you're gonna see me
in a Music Together class

00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,603
with my three kids
under 5.

00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:06,839
I will be there
singing full‐voice,

00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:09,408
playing a recorder,
banging on a wood block.

00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:10,876
This is my life.
I do this.

00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,878
But this is
a hard product.

00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,547
You're building
a two‐sided marketplace

00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,649
where there has to be
enough demand on the user side

00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:18,517
and enough supply
on the other side.

00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:20,920
And the reality for me is
if I'm not jumping in,

00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,221
I'm jumping out.

00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,622
These deals for me,

00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:25,524
I have to have my whole gut in,
or I'm out.

00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,393
And so,
I hope you prove me wrong,

00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,128
but on this one,
I'm out.

00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:31,163
Okay,
thank you for the opportunity.

00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:33,866
You have one Shark left,
Desiree ‐‐ Mark Cuban.
And he's got more billions
than that guy,

00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:34,867
so you're lucky.

00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:36,368
And you'll have experience,

00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,137
and we're coming
to your hometown.

00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:54,986
nobody else out there
who's gonna come after you.

00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:57,055
So I can't guarantee there's
nobody going after the space,

00:40:57,055 --> 00:40:59,324
but I can guarantee that nobody
pops up on our radar

00:40:59,324 --> 00:41:00,692
with this level
of traction.

00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:01,993
Why do you win?

00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:04,395
We win because we've done this
time and time again.

00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:06,698
The market is there.
Everybody is there.

00:41:06,698 --> 00:41:07,865
They're waiting
for the solution.

00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:09,867
They don't know about it.
I want to work with you.

00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:12,403
I can't do the 20% because it ‐‐
it's too much dilution.

00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:13,905
The valuation is
too low for us.

00:41:13,905 --> 00:41:15,740
Well, you're sucking up
very well, I have to admit.

00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,976
The question is,
will it save you any equity?
It's genuine.

00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:19,310
Are you willing
to do it for less, Chris?

00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,578
That's all.

00:41:22,547 --> 00:41:23,781
You nailed that response,

00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:24,916
but you still didn't
get me there.

00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:26,184
I like your approach.

00:41:26,184 --> 00:41:28,453
I think I could help you
make it a lot better.

00:41:28,453 --> 00:41:30,288
But I got to dig in
at 20%.

00:41:30,288 --> 00:41:31,856
That's what makes it
meaningful for me.

00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:36,594
Under any circumstance,
you're not doing 20%?

00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:39,964
I would 20% for more money.

00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:41,632
[ Laughs ]

00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:44,569
I came in here with
a 3.15 pre‐money valuation.

00:41:44,569 --> 00:41:46,404
I think it's very fair.

00:41:46,404 --> 00:41:47,472
At a certain point,

00:41:47,472 --> 00:41:50,041
you just have to make
the decision.

00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:51,542
Corcoran: So,
what's your decision?

00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:57,048
So, I will respectfully decline
the offer.

00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:01,853
I appreciate the feedback
and the consideration.

00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:02,987
Congrats, Jeff.

00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:04,622
Thank you.

00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:08,092
O'Leary: You know, he wasn't
gonna do a deal for 20%.

00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:10,228
That's it.
It's that simple.
Yep.

00:42:10,228 --> 00:42:13,798
I could've got him
another 200,000 users, easily.

00:42:13,798 --> 00:42:16,934
He's a bozo.
He didn't think that through.

00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:20,405
I honestly feel like
this was the best opportunity

00:42:20,405 --> 00:42:22,240
that's ever stood
in front of the Sharks,

00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,777
and they will sincerely regret
not getting a piece of it.
