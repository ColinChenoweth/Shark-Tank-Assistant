Why not quit the job

This is "Shark Tank."

founder of the game‐changing
mega‐brand Skinnygirl,

It's a good product,

00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:32,766
and I think that's totally lost
in the message.

00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:33,800
Both: Aah!

00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,702
I think it's a little too edgy.

00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,504
‐No worries, girlfriend.
‐No!

00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:39,473
I haven't been in bed
with so many billionaires

in at least a couple of weeks.
‐Aah!

We're the parents

Hi, Sharks.
My name is Jennifer.

00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,079
And I'm Gita.

00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,014
We're from Los Angeles,
California,

00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:23,650
and our company
is called No Mo‐Stache.

We are seeking $100,000

No Mo‐Stache is revolutionizing

Ladies, have you
ever been driving

00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,264
to an important business
meeting, and...

00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,699

...notice a glistening, hairy

busy moms,

juggling a million
things at once,

Both: Aah!

No Mo‐Stache has all of these
hairy situations handled.

00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,387
They are mess‐free
cold‐wax strips,

00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:04,625
so there is no risk of burning
your skin with hot, gooey wax.

00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,494
Curious how it works?
We thought you would be.

00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:11,665
So first, rub the strip in your
hands to heat the wax up.

00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:13,433
It's that easy.

00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,936
Then pull the strip apart
and apply it

00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,437
to the side of your face.

00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:21,174
Rub back and forth for hair
to adhere to the wax.

‐I need to ask a very ‐‐
‐Do we get samples?

00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:55,075
I need to ask a very,
very important question.
We have some samples.

00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:56,209
If you get
that extra hair,

00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,744
why don't you just
shave like the rest of us?

00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,012
‐What?!
‐Oh, no!

00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,381
You take a little razor
and go badabing, badaboom,

00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,917
and it's gone.
‐No, it would grow in.

00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,419
It would grow in.

00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:07,320
You would have a Chia Pet
on your lip

00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,256
by a week from Tuesday.
‐No.

00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:11,024
Have you ever tried it?
Then you don't know.

00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,893
‐Excuse my ignorance.
‐Uh‐huh.

00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:14,027
Is this that big a problem?

00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,363
Is there that many women
that have mustaches?

00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,998
‐Oh, my God.
‐Everybody has a mustache.

00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:19,266
‐Everybody.
‐Really?

00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,068
Let me ask you a question.
What's the difference between

00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:23,103
this and the Sally Hansen strips
that you carry in your purse?

00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:24,137
Perfect,
perfect example.

00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:25,539
You could carry it
in your purse,

00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,574
and somebody could see it
when you open up your bag.

00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:30,177
And then they'll be
like, "Girl, why do you
have the Sally Hansens?"

00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:32,145
Sorry, I don't know what
a Sally Hansen strip is.

00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:34,681
It's the waxing people.
They have a business
of hair removal.

00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,550
A bunch of people do.
‐Yeah, they're beauty ‐‐

00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,785
But this is a tin.
Their concept here
is discretion.

00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:41,354
This is a tin. It's like putting
a tampon in a single container.

00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:43,123
There's nothing
proprietary about this?

00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:44,357
‐No.
‐No.

00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,159
It is the only portable
waxing kit on the market.

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,394
Is it patented in some way?

00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,428
No. You can't
patent the tin.

00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:49,529
So what are
you bringing here?

00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:50,997
What do you've got
that worth anything?

00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,566
‐I have no idea.
‐It's portable.

00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,800
It's portable.

00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,969
I have 14 years of waxing
experience as a beautician.

00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,171
‐That's worth $400,000?
‐The proof is in the sales.

00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:59,773
Right?
‐The proof is in the sales.

00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:02,008
Tell us what it costs you
to make, what you sell it for,

00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,311
where you sell it,
and how much you've sold.

00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:07,214
Our cost of goods
is $1.74 landed.

00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:10,217
‐The whole kit.
‐The whole kit sent here.

00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:12,319
We've done $400,000
in sales...

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,553
‐What?!
‐Cuban: There you go.

00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:14,654
...in two years, yeah.

00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,490
How much this year
are you going to do?

00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,891
$300,000 this year.

00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:19,793
Last year we sold ‐‐
‐What does it sell for?

00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:21,661
I'm sorry.
‐It's $18 retail.

00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:22,796
That one little tin is $18?

00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:24,264
‐It's 12 wax services.
‐12 wax strips.

00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,999
So there you go, Bethenny.

00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,334
‐Listen.
‐Ba‐bam!

00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:28,969
I really do think
this is a gimmick.

00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:31,404
It's what you buy on the way out
of, like, the lingerie store.

00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:32,873
‐It's a $400,000 gimmick.
‐So, wait.

00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:34,608
So where are you selling it?
‐I don't get it.

00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,244
So, we're currently
selling at Sephora.

00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:39,579
We're in the checkout
beauty on the go, in the bins,

00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:40,614
the impulse bins.
‐Wow.

00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,615
‐That's beautiful.
‐Yes.

00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,283
Cuban: Gita, how did you
get in there?

00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:47,220
So, we got our product
in Real Simple magazine.

00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,323
And then one day, our e‐mail
just kept going bonkers.

00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:51,825
And I'm like,
"What is going on?"

00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,560
And just order after
order after order.

00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,762
And yet, there's nothing
proprietary but what's in here.

00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,230
But you know what?
Convenience sells.

00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,065
There's nothing proprietary
about water, either.

00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:00,500
‐Yes.
‐Are you in every Sephora?

00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,102
‐No, we're in 60 Sephoras.
‐No, we're not.

00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:04,037
‐60. How many are there, total?
‐Yes.

00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,639
‐Remind me.
‐200.

00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,674
‐Can you get the other stores?
‐Why do you think

00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,376
they haven't
taken you into the others?

00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:13,647
Originally, we were in the other
stores, in 200 stores.

00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,916
And now we're in 60 stores.

00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,250
‐Okay.
‐They reduced?

00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,052
So the sales weren't good
in some of those places?

00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,121
Actually, that's not true.
Every single week,

00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,622
the sales were consistent.
‐Then why?

00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,758
They wanted to bring ‐‐
make room for new trends.

00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,626
That happens, right?
They roll through things.

00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,261
‐Yeah, it's ‐‐
‐Well, so that's a little bit

00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,629
of a concern
'cause this may not be ‐‐

00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,898
If it was selling really
well, they would've kept it.

00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:33,366
Right?
‐I mean ‐‐

00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,702
It's hard to defend the fact
that you lost 140 stores.

00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:38,038
That's what basically
happened, right?
Yes.

00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:40,240
But I've had so many products
that have gone into all doors,

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,175
and then they do take it down ‐‐
‐Well, tell me why ‐‐

00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,277
Tell me why
that's exciting news.

00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:47,347
Well, what's exciting news
is that since then,

00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,549
we have been pushing
the pedal to the metal

00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:51,785
to not have all
of our eggs in one basket.

00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,587
‐In the Sephora basket.
‐Both: Exactly.

00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:54,921
That's it.

00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:58,091
So basically, it's a marketing
play on an old commodity.

00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,927
And you've done a good job in
getting some shelf space for it.

00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:02,963
Hopefully, you're going
to diversify your sales

00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:06,366
outside of just
one distributor.
Yes.

00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:10,871
We are launching with five
more distributors in September.

00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,239
Oh, it came off.
It did.

00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:13,640
I want to say
something positive.

00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,442
I just waxed Mark's arm,
which I never thought

00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:16,910
I'd say in this lifetime.
‐You did?

00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,379
So, all the competitors
that I have used in the past,

00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,114
they are very sticky.
They get gooey.

00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:22,749
They get all over everything.
‐Yeah.

00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:24,918
They're still on there later,
and you're feeling it.

00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:27,554
I just waxed his arm,
and it's very neat.

00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,156
Now that Mark has been waxed,
that changes everything.

00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,491
So I'm going to
make you an offer.

00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,492
‐Yeah.
‐You ready?

00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:35,028
You're asking $100,000 for 25%.

00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,630
You're very lucky
to be here today.

00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,064
I might say that, too.
‐Yeah.

00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:43,737
Because I'm willing to give you
the $100,000 for 10%.

00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,972
Wow.
But the way you're
going to pay me back

00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:48,875
is I'm going
to get $1 a lip.

00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,343
That's the way I like
to look at it.

00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:51,411
‐A lip?

‐Or...

00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,952
‐Smart.
‐Yeah.

00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,221
...you can lay it flat

00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,290
like a large, traditional
changing pad.

00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,825
It has a foam pillow inside

00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:20,593
so it's comfortable
to use anywhere,

00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:24,197
and its water‐resistant surface
wipes clean in seconds.

00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,631
So, Sharks,
with your expertise

00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:26,999
and a little bit
of your capital,

00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,801
we can get the Clean Hands
Changing Pad

00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,236
on the shelves
across the world.

00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,237
Do we get samples?

00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:33,473
‐Yes!
‐Exactly.

00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:36,409
‐We'll take the baby.
‐All right.

00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:38,578
So, Emmett's going to help
pass out these things.

00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:39,579
Good job, Emmett.

00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:42,081
‐He's cute.
‐Aww.

00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,549
‐Hi!
‐He's a shy guy.

00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,917
He loves people
from a distance,

00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,453
but he gets a little shy
sometimes up close.

00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:50,423
‐Hello!
‐Oh!

00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:52,291
Robert, go ahead
and change his diaper.

00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,794
All right, we'll pass
the baby down.

00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:56,662
We'll pass the baby along.
Thank you.

00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:59,265
‐There you go.
‐Oh, thank you.

00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:00,900
‐Hey!
‐Oh, my God.

00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,035
I want to take the baby.
You all ‐‐ You have five.

00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,837
You could spare one.

00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,706
‐Oh, wait.
‐Lori's scaring the baby.

00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:07,940
Aww!
Hey, no worries.

00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,777
Well, it actually
is his nap time.

00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:11,878
‐Aww.
‐It is.

00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:13,246
Kevin's, too,
but we keep him up.

00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,447
Well, he's been
awesome so far.

00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:15,982
But we're going to pass him
out to Grandma

00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:17,417
'cause we don't want
to push our luck.

00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,918
‐Not today.
‐I'll be right back.

00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,320
‐Bye!
‐Bye, Emmett.

00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,157
So, Sharks, which one of you
wants to join us

00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:26,359
to turn stressful,
messy diaper time

00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:29,328
into fun, clean play time
for babies everywhere?

00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,931
It's really clever.
I've never seen anything that...

00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,499
What's proprietary here?

00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,168
We're patent‐pending
on the ‐‐

00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:36,769
We call it the
redirection barrier,

00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,038
that goes around the child
as you're changing him.

00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,306
So utility patent?

00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,941
Yeah, we have
a utility patent pending.

00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,843
When do you think
you'll get it?

00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:47,013
It'll probably still be
another year or so.
Wow.

00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:48,514
Guys, can you tell us
your background?

00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:52,285
So, we have no, like,
business experience.

00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:55,054
I sold shampoo
before I met him.

00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,289
I was in sales
for nine years.

00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,356
Yeah.
What were you selling?

00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:58,658
What did you sell?
What did you sell?

00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:00,059
I was selling
freight logistics.

00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,627
What made you want
to start the business?

00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,029
Well, when we had
this idea,

00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:05,932
we made a rough prototype
for one of our sons.

00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:08,201
And we took it out
at a party one day,

00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:10,536
and we got a lot
of reaction from people.

00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:12,805
We were just changing our
own kid's diaper.

00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,073
So we did
an initial test run.

00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,808
We saw there was
good reaction from people,

00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,176
so we launched
on Kickstarter.

00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,245
We had a huge success there.
‐How much were you asking?

00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:21,147
How much did you ask for,
how much did you get?

00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,683
We were asking for 10,000.
We got 120,000.

00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:24,684
‐Wow.
‐Wow.

00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:26,819
You sold 120,000
on Kickstarter.

00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,654
‐Yeah.
‐Did you ship all that?

00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,423
So ‐‐ So, that's
a very interesting story.

00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:31,691
Do you want to take that,
Amy?

00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:36,095
Sure.
So, we got 10,000 units in

00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,830
and we opened up
our containers,

00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,767
and that's when we realized
30% is not finished.

00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,302
Where was it being
manufactured?

00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,004
‐Oh, my God.
‐It was overseas.

00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,072
But what happened next?

00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:47,573
'Cause the key is
what you did next.

00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:50,543
So, that's when
I actually quit my job.

00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:52,378
We have
a 1,500‐square‐foot house.

00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,714
We...
There was six people
living in it at a time,

00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:56,549
and I was pregnant
with our son.

00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:58,351
‐Wow.
‐We overhauled our house.

00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,887
Yeah.
We got a bunch of friends
and family to inspect,

00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:02,288
and we hired
some people to sew.

00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:04,023
So, what do you want to do
with this product?

00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,992
What's the plan with ‐‐ If I
give you the $85,000 ‐‐

00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:08,027
Well, how 'bout what have they
been doing with the product?

00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,695
What have you sold,
and where are you selling it?

00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,098
All right. So, we've been doing
this for just about two years,

00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:14,300
and our total sales
are $700,000 in revenue.

00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,368
‐Whoa!
‐Wow.

00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,803
‐$700,000?
‐That's great.

00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,272
‐What have you done ‐‐
‐And raising five kids.

00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:20,706
What have you done
this year to date?

00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,308
So, our first year
we did $140,000.

00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:23,709
Last year,
we did $400,000.

00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,512
This year, we're projected
to hit over $650,000.

00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:27,847
Where did you sell that?

00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:30,583
We sold that online on our
own website and on Amazon.

00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,251
Have you tried
any retailers?

00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:35,688
So, we're planning on going
to the baby show...

00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:37,657
You haven't ever
been there before?

00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:40,426
We haven't ‐‐
We haven't visited there yet.
Wow.

00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:43,062
You're doing $700,000,
and you've hit the trade show?

00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,363
And why isn't this
in buybuy Baby

00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:45,932
or, like, real, like,
baby retailers?

00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:47,800
This issue we had with
our manufacturing

00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,236
in the beginning really set
us back with our cash flow.

00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,038
Hmm.
And if we're going
to get into retail,

00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:54,006
we need help
from someone like you.

00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,474
So, now much do one
of these cost?

00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,543
What do you sell them for,
and what do they cost to make?

00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,979
So, we got the price down
to about $6 per unit.

00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:01,147
‐Wow.
‐$6 per unit?

00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:02,515
And what are you
selling it for?

00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:03,816
We sell it for $29.99
on our website.

00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,251
People will spend
anything on babies.

00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,620
How much did you spend
on marketing last year

00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,655
for online ads?
‐Yes.

00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:12,358
So, our marketing was about
40% of revenue last year.

00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:14,961
Ooh.
So it was about
100‐something thousand.

00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,862
Did you make any money
last year?

00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:18,064
Yes, we did.

00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:19,599
So, we've been paying
ourselves a little bit

00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,767
because we need
to pay the bills.

00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,269
We take out about
$4,000 a month,

00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,204
and we have that pay
for our seven.

00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,372
But you know what, guys?

00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:28,307
You guys deserve
a ton of credit.

00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:29,308
‐Yeah.
‐Yeah.

00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,476
You've done
a much better job

00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,411
than people that come out
with MBAs and the rest.

00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,180
So I can't applaud
you enough.

00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,648
But even though
it's a great idea,

00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:38,551
I think marketing it is going
to be harder than you imagine.

00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:40,720
That's why you're spending
40% of your revenue.

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,022
‐Mm‐hmm.
‐I think you can get innovative,

00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:45,591
but I think it's a lot more
challenging than you realize.

00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,727
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:49,128
‐Okay.
‐Sure, Mark. Thank you.

00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,563
‐Yeah, thank you.
‐Congrats, though.

00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:51,797
Thank you.

00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,601
I like you guys.
I think it's phenomenal.

00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,403
I think you are true
entrepreneurs.

00:18:57,403 --> 00:19:00,272
But I like products
that you buy often

00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:01,574
and always that you keep ‐‐

00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:03,709
you know, consumables or
products that you keep buying.

00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:06,746
And I'm scared of it just being
one SKU that you buy once.

00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:08,781
So for that reason, I'm out.

00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:11,250
‐Well, thank you so much.
‐Thank you.

00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:15,121
You know, I look at this
as a product, not a business.

00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:17,990
The only way I'd do
this deal is if ‐‐

00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,925
It would have to have
this huge contingency

00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,527
on the patent being issued.

00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,996
Because I want to take this
and license it

00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,499
to a large manufacturer
that already has logistics,

00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,402
manufacturing, marketing,
and a customer base.

00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:31,437
‐Mm‐hmm.
‐My offer's this.

00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:35,408
I'll give you the $85,000
for 20%...

00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:36,542
Ooh.

00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,611
Wow.

00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:41,280
...contingent on the patent
being issued.

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,717
And then, you have to agree,
although you'll control it,

00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:46,252
to take a license deal.

00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:47,720
So now, you would be
okay with us

00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,056
still selling
this product on our own.

00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:51,924
‐Of course.
‐You shouldn't license it

00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,759
because you've built
a real business.

00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:56,028
‐I disagree.
‐I disagree with you completely.

00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,530
What are you going
to do, Robert?

00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,799
So, love you guys.

00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:03,936
My challenge is a little bit
about the single product.

00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,671
You're very good
with finding needs.

00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:08,841
I'd like to see you
expand the products.

00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:11,911
I think ‐‐ I think you're going
to need a little more money.

00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:14,013
I'd like to see some of
the money be used maybe

00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:17,850
for some more product
development, that kind of stuff.

00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,086
Keep going with the online ads.

00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:24,023
[ Sighs ]

00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:28,594
I'll give you $125,000
for ‐‐

00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:31,997
for 15%.

00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:33,966
$125,000 for 15%.

00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:36,769
Greiner: All right.
What's really cool is

00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:38,537
I've never seen anything
like this.

00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:40,973
It fits into my family
of products.

00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:44,744

00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:27,105
I'll tell you what's keeping me
awake on this deal...

00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:28,473
‐Wow.
‐...is this $800,000 for 10%.

00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:30,175
‐Well, don't go there yet.
‐I have to go there.

00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:31,743
Don't go there yet!
I understand the product.

00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:32,945
Let me first explain
how it works.

00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:34,846
It's a speaker in a pillow
for $8 million.

00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:36,315
‐No!
‐It's not a speaker,

00:28:36,315 --> 00:28:38,183
and it's not a pillow.
‐Got it. I love the schtick.

00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:39,585
‐It's not a pillow.
‐It's $8 million.

00:28:39,585 --> 00:28:41,486
It's a lot more than a pillow.

00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:43,288
You don't sell it
as a pillow?

00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:45,657
If you call it a pillow, people
aren't used to paying

00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:47,192
more
than $20, $30, $40.

00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:48,360
What does it cost?

00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,164
The pillow is $159, average.

00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:53,865
That's a lot for a pillow.
‐Right.

00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:56,668
So that's why I'm saying
it's really a relaxation tool.

00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:59,137
My trouble with it,
and we've got to get
back to deal with this

00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:00,572
because we're in the Shark Tank,

00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,808
and you're asking for
$800,000 for 10%.

00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:05,010
That's $8 million valuation.

00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,645
Well, I think it's
an amazing opportunity

00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:07,713
for the following reasons.

00:29:07,713 --> 00:29:09,081
‐Oh, really?
‐Yeah.

00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,416
It's a sleep product
which is addressing

00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,352
over a third
of the population.

00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:16,021
Support that, other than just
saying it helps people sleep.

00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:17,489
Show Mr. Wonderful
the money.

00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:21,293
We've got $600,000 in sales
since we launched last November.

00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:24,329
Okay.
What are you going to make
in cash flow this year

00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:26,999
that would want or entice me
to give you $800,000?

00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:29,601
Our projections
for the year are $1.2 million.

00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,303
Okay, what are you
going to make on that?

00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:35,474
Oh, our profit on that
will be roughly $150,000.

00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:37,042
We really didn't even
talk about your cost.

00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:38,410
We have a 65% margin
on the product.

00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,112
‐65% margin.
‐But where are those

00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,980
$1.2 million in sales
coming from?

00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,617
A combination of Amazon,
direct to consumer,

00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,185
retail, online retail.

00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:49,321
O'Leary: Randall, I buy that

You're saying you're going
to make $150,000 this year.

00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:57,129
That's a projection, by the way.
After tax, $125,000.

00:29:57,129 --> 00:30:02,034
You're asking me to pay 64 times
your profit this year,

00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:04,603
if you hit it,
which is still speculative.

00:30:04,603 --> 00:30:05,971
Yeah. We ‐‐

that might keep
somebody away at night

they're listening to?

Narrator:
All Sharks are still in.

00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,725
They're interested in dreampad,

00:30:26,725 --> 00:30:30,395
a pillow that aids sleep by
playing music through vibration.

00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:33,799
But they want Randall
to defend his steep valuation.

at the future value.

We've made projections
five years out.

00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:05,597

00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:11,570
You're right. It all comes down
to the projections.

I would ask you to consider
the key things

00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:20,879
that are supporting
the valuation.

00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,681
‐Which are?
‐Number one, it's patented.

00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:24,383
‐So?
‐Number two, it's addressing

00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,218
an incredible need
within the country.

00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:28,353
Agreed.
Number three is it's got
a supply chain

00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:29,688

00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,585
Oh.

00:35:53,585 --> 00:35:55,020
Okay, here we go.

00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,921
‐Mrs. Wonderful!
‐Mrs. Wonderful!

00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:58,089
‐Look at that.
‐Yeah.

00:35:58,089 --> 00:35:59,791
Kevin is married,
I have to say.

00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:01,626
‐Kevin!
‐That's okay.

00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:05,664
So, the tin on your tray is
the blend that you received.

00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,432
You'll be able to find out
what the blend's called

00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:10,135
by looking inside your card.

00:36:10,135 --> 00:36:11,603
‐Hey, girl.
‐Thank you.

00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:13,204
‐You got it.
‐Hey, girl.

00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:14,606
There you go.

00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:16,307
I just need to take off
this jacket.

00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:18,109
O'Leary: So, Jenni‐Lyn,
I have a card here

00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:20,578
that says "Mr. Wonderful" on
the front and inside it says,

00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:23,148
"Blend ‐‐
Calm the [bleep] down.

00:36:23,148 --> 00:36:25,650
You're just so handsome
when you smile.

00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:26,951
That's true.

00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:28,520
"Caribbean rooibos
fruit with coconut"?

00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,321
‐It's a rooibos tea...
‐Rooibos.

00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:32,490
‐Rooibos.
‐...which is great

00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,325
for inflammation
and hypertension,

00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,361
so it really does help
you calm the [bleep] down.

00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:38,530
Mine says, "Our signature blend
for the person

00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,398
fierce enough to swim
with the Sharks."

00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:42,500
Well, that remains
to be seen.

00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,535
We believe in you,
Bethenny.

00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:44,536
‐TBD.
‐Wow.

00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:45,603
We know you can hang.

00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:47,238
Are all these blends
for women only?

00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:49,841
Yes.
That would leave 50%
of the market untouched.

00:36:49,841 --> 00:36:51,776
I became really passionate
about this idea

00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:54,045
that I'm not the only
woman out there

00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:57,248
who's struggling with trying
to meet all of the expectations

00:36:57,248 --> 00:36:59,050
that we kind of
put on women today.

00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,453
So I took a product
that we also have

00:37:01,453 --> 00:37:03,822
a ton of expectations
about, right?

00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:07,826
We think of tea as kind of
this gentle, dainty beverage.

00:37:07,826 --> 00:37:10,261
But I broke it out of its box.

00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:13,031
And in the end, I think it's
really a better representation

00:37:13,031 --> 00:37:14,299
of what the drink is.

00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:15,700
It's a badass beverage.

00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,935
‐So it's intentional.
‐Yeah.

00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:18,136
Right out of the gate,

00:37:18,136 --> 00:37:19,871
you're not going after
half the market.

00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:21,106
That's right.

00:37:21,106 --> 00:37:23,108
But women are the purchasers
of the household.

00:37:23,108 --> 00:37:24,509
When are you
buying tea bags?

00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:26,177
I buy them all the time,
actually.
You do?

00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:27,378
‐Oh, yeah.
‐Yeah, I do too.

00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:29,481
I drink tea. What am I,
chopped liver here?

00:37:29,481 --> 00:37:32,050
Let's be clear, right?
You're not selling tea, right?

00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,551
‐Right.
‐You're selling attitude.

00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:35,954
‐Well, we're selling both.
‐Where are you selling this?

00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:38,957
So right now, 85% of our sales
are done retail

00:37:38,957 --> 00:37:40,291
through our own website.

00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:44,095
We do 15% wholesale,
so we're in about 40 stores.

00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,430
Which stores?

00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:48,032
Mostly, like, women‐owned
boutiques and gift shops.

00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:50,635
I've heard tea, for many people,
is relaxing.

00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:52,937
Yet it's called Snarky
and you're going to alienate

00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,773
places like Walmart and...
‐Right.

00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:56,808
...you know, a lot
of major retailers.

00:37:56,808 --> 00:37:59,544
I feel a little confused.

00:37:59,544 --> 00:38:00,845
What are your sales?

00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:05,383
We've done $190,000
in eight months.
Whoa!

00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:06,951
Give us customer
acquisition cost.

00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:10,321
So, our cost of acquiring
customer right now is about $11.

00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:11,823
How much is this?

00:38:11,823 --> 00:38:14,292
So, there are 15 sachets
in each of our tins,

00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,393
and they're $12.99.

00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:19,297
That's expensive, though.
A K‐Cup is 66 cents.

00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,632
‐Tell us your costs.
‐Okay.

00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:24,135
So, each of our tins
actually cost us $4.34 to make.

00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,104
‐$4.34? That's a lot.
‐Yes.

00:38:26,104 --> 00:38:28,173
‐How much do you sell it for?
‐$12.99 a tin.

00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:29,407
So you're not making
any money.

00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:32,744
Your customer acquisition
costs 11 bucks.

00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:34,245
Greiner: Well, listen.

00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:38,349
I find that this kind of cute
labeling and all of that,

00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:40,451
I'm afraid it's not sustainable.

00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:45,490
And gimmicky branding,
I just don't see as long future.

00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:48,860
So while I think you are
clever and smart, I'm out.

00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,361
Thank you, Lori.

00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:53,965
Jenni‐Lyn, I've done very well
by finding niche things...

00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:55,600
‐Yes.

00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,734
and expanding them.

‐I ‐‐

00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:00,505

‐Yes.

00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:04,475
I don't see people
buying tins of tea online

00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:06,511
as a sole business.

00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:09,948

I'm out.

00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:14,419
Jenni‐Lyn,
now anything that's sold

00:39:14,419 --> 00:39:16,955
in retail
competes with Amazon.

00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:19,657
‐I'm on Amazon.
‐Doesn't matter, right?

00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:23,661
The challenge is that not only
is Amazon distributing products,

00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:25,930
but they're also starting
to create their own...

00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,232
‐Right.
‐...that are obviously

00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,666

than everybody else.

00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,034
‐Yes.
‐And it's their brand,

00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,003
so they get to put it
and promote it however

00:39:32,003 --> 00:39:34,372
they want in
the easiest‐to‐buy format.

00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,008
Click it, and it shows up
in two hours.
Yep.

00:39:37,008 --> 00:39:39,244
I like what you're doing
from a marketing perspective,

00:39:39,244 --> 00:39:42,580
