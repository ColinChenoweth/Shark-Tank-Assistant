## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
genderGraph <- ggplot(gender_data, aes(x = Industry, y = count, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Gender Distribution by Industry",
       x = "Industry",
       y = "Count") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Female" = "blue", "Male" = "red", "Mixed Team" = "purple")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

plot(genderGraph)
```
