YEAH, WE HAVE.

00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:48,568

YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT THE BANK DIDN'T BRING

00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:51,071
TO THE PARTY WERE
WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE.
WAS WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE.

00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:53,340

SO WHAT EXACTLY WOULD

OKAY.
OKAY. THANK YOU.

YEAH, I FEEL THE SAME.

00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:21,768
I HAVE SO MUCH RESPECT
FOR WHAT YOU GUYS ARE DOING.

00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:24,871
BUT YOU DON'T NEED ME
AS A PARTNER.

00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,874
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE
ADVANTAGEOUS TO YOU. I'M OUT.

00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:32,746

UH, VERY, VERY, UH,
INSPIRATIONAL STORY.

I WILL SEND A BALL.

YOU THE COUPON CODE. (laughs)
AND I HAD A BALL,
BUT I'M OUT.

I'M OUT.

AND YOU KNOW WHY I'M OUT?

THE DEAL THAT I'M PUTTING
TOGETHER TODAY

00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,069

A MULTIMILLION‐DOLLAR DEAL.
APPRECIATE IT AGAIN.

HI. MY NAME IS MARK BURGINGER.
I'M FROM BEND, OREGON,

00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:52,745
AND I'M THE CREATOR OF QUBITS,
THE CONSTRUCTION TOY FOR KIDS.

00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,948
I WORK AS AN ARCHITECT,
BUT LIKE MANY PEOPLE,

00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:58,818
I PLAYED WITH CONSTRUCTION TOYS
WHEN I WAS A KID,

00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,887
AND I THINK IT INFLUENCED ME

00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:03,957
TO BECOME AN ARCHITECT
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:06,593
THIS IS A QUBIT, AND IT'S ABLE
TO BUILD STRUCTURES

00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:10,496
BY COMBINING WITH OTHER QUBITS.

00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:13,633
CURRENTLY,
WITH THE SLOW ECONOMY,

00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:15,735
UH, ARCHITECTURAL JOBS
ARE HARD TO COME BY.

00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,972
ONCE YOU START
TO ACCUMULATE SOME DEBT,

00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:21,241
IT'S A LOAD ON ME,
IT PUTS A LOAD ON MY WIFE,

00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,309
AND MY KIDS, EVEN,
ARE AFFECTED BY THAT.

00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:27,013

00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,369
UNLIKE ANY OTHER TOY
IN THE WORLD.

00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:26,439
THESE TOYS ARE QUITE EASY
TO PUT TOGETHER,

00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:28,574
AS YOU JUST SECURE 'EM
WITH A CONNECTOR.

00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:31,678
THEN YOU COULD USE A PANEL
PERHAPS,

COULD YOU TOSS SOMETHING TO US

00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:41,654
SO WE COULD FEEL IT,
PUT IT IN OUR HAND?

00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,457
LITTLE TOO FAR AWAY FOR US

"I'LL GIVE UP 51%,
CONTROL OF MY COMPANY."

00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:00,573
WHY?

00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,809
WELL,

00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:05,078
ONE, I'M SMART.

00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:08,614

DO YOU HAVE A PATENT ON THIS?

00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:22,962
YES, I DO.
ARE THERE OTHER TOYS
THAT BEND AND TWIST LIKE THIS?

00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:27,033
NO, NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE.
MARK, I'M SO CURIOUS
HOW YOU CAME UP WITH THIS.

00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,802
IT WAS A CREATIVE ENDEAVOR
THAT I'VE HAD IN MY MIND

00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,704
FOR A LONG TIME.

00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,273
ONCE YOU CREATE A FORM WITH THIS
TYPE OF GEOMETRY, THEY CAN

00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:37,110
CREATE NATURAL STRUCTURES
THAT RELATE DIRECTLY TO SCIENCE.

SORRY, MARK.
$8,000 OR $80,000?

00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,198
8‐‐NO, $8,000 WORTH.

00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:30,296
NO. I HAVE‐‐

00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:33,166

00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:39,672
I HAVE INVESTED $60,000.
OF YOUR OWN MONEY?

00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:42,775

00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,890

YOU CAN AFFORD TO DO THAT.

00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,326
THEY'LL EITHER LIKE IT

00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:04,230

NOTHING I HAVE DONE HERE
IS A WASTE.

UP AGAINST THE BIG BOYS
THAT HAVE SPENT

00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:36,429
TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
IN CREATING BRANDS.

I DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN COMPETE
WITH THEM,

00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:42,201
SO I'M OUT, MARK.

00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:48,875

THAT KILLED
SOME OF OUR LIVESTOCK.

SO I DID SOME RESEARCH,
AND I FOUND THAT LLAMAS

WERE A GREAT DETERRENT
TO MOUNTAIN LIONS.

00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,341
SO I ASKED MY HUSBAND IF WE
COULD BUY SOME, AND WE DID.

WE ENDED UP FALLING IN LOVE

00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:54,626
(as Marvin the Martian) "I'M
GOING TO DESTROY THE EARTH."
ALAN, WHAT DOES THAT WEIGH,
THAT UMBRELLA?

00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:56,761
IT WEIGHS ABOUT 2.5 POUNDS...
BOOM!

00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,797
BUT WHEN IT'S ON YOUR SHOULDERS,
YOU WON'T EVEN FEEL IT.

00:34:58,797 --> 00:35:01,232
IT'S REALLY LIGHT. SO‐‐
THAT IS SO FUNNY TO LOOK AT.

00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:04,369
(Alan) IT'S DIFFERENT. IT'S
UNIQUE. IT LOOKS GOOD ON YOU.
(Daymond) HELLO, BARBARA.

00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:06,671
IT'S AN ATTENTION‐GETTER,
FOR SURE.

00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:10,575
HOW MANY HAVE
YOU SOLD SO FAR, ALAN?
I'VE SOLD 3,000.

00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:14,813
HOW DO THEY FIND YOU TO BUY IT?
UH, THE MEDIA PICKED IT UP,
AND IT'S ALL OVER THE WORLD.

00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:18,049
I GET CALLS EVERY SINGLE DAY,
AND I'VE NEVER SPENT $1

00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:21,620
IN MARKETING
OR ADVERTISING THIS PRODUCT.
WHAT DO THEY SELL FOR
ON THE INTERNET SITE?

00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,121
$49.
YEAH.

00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,924
BUT GET THIS‐‐I JUST SOURCED
A NEW MANUFACTURER,

00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:29,995
AND RIGHT NOW, YOU CAN BUY
THIS PRODUCT FOR $29.

00:35:29,995 --> 00:35:33,031
THAT'S BETTER.
$29?
WHAT'S YOUR COST ON THAT?

00:35:33,031 --> 00:35:35,800
MY COST IS $14.
DO YOU HAVE ANY ORDERS
ON THIS?

00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,004
I HAVE HUNDREDS OF ORDERS RIGHT
NOW THAT I CANNOT FULFILL.

00:35:39,004 --> 00:35:41,940
FROM WHAT, CONSUMERS? UH...
ALL FROM THE INTERNET.

00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,042
SO, ALAN, YOU'VE SOLD
3,000 UNITS, ONE AT A TIME,

00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:46,177
OUT OF YOUR HOUSE?
RIGHT.

00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:49,648
I'M ASSUMING
THIS HAS A PATENT ON IT.
I DO HAVE A PATENT.
IT'S BEEN ISSUED A U. S. PATENT.

00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:52,617
I HAVE A PATENT PENDING
IN ALL OF EUROPE RIGHT NOW.

00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:55,620
MY GOAL IS TO BUILD
AN EXTREME WEATHER GEAR BRAND.

00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,956
EVERYBODY THAT'S BOUGHT
THIS PRODUCT

00:35:57,956 --> 00:36:00,291
CURRENTLY OWNS
A REGULAR UMBRELLA,

00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:02,293
BUT THEY CLEARLY RECOGNIZE
THIS PRODUCT

00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,496
FOR MORE EXTREME WEATHER
CONDITIONS

00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,998
AND FOR ITS REVOLUTIONARY
HANDS‐FREE FEATURE.

00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,800
I'VE GOT PEOPLE RIGHT NOW

00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,102
RIDING BIKES WITH THIS
ALL AROUND THE WORLD.

00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:12,771
THAT'S A HOME RUN.

00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:15,774
HOW WOULD YOU RIDE A BIKE
ON IT?
YOU JUST STRAP IT ON,

00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:18,476
AND IT WILL NOT MOVE
IN 35‐MILE‐AN‐HOUR WIND.

00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,679
ARE YOU SAYING IT'S‐‐
IT'S FIRM?

00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:24,582
IT WON'T MOVE.
ALAN, WHAT ARE YOU ASKING FOR,
FOR HOW MUCH?

00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:27,452
I'M LOOKING FOR $200,000
FOR A 25% EQUITY.

00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:30,555
I'VE ALREADY PUT IN‐‐THERE'S ONE
INVESTOR FOR $400,000,

00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:33,892
AND I'VE PUT IN $500,000.
$900,000?

00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:37,262
SO YOU'VE GOT $900,000
IN THE GROUND?
$900,000 IN CASH.

00:36:37,262 --> 00:36:39,264
ALAN, IF YOU'VE PUT IN
$900,000 ALREADY,

00:36:39,264 --> 00:36:41,566
WHY DO YOU NEED
ANOTHER $200,000?

00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:43,368
I'M OUT OF MONEY.

00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:45,370
THAT'S AN HONEST ANSWER.
RIGHT.

00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,938
I‐I LIKE THAT.

00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:49,274
I'VE COME HERE
WITH AN AGGRESSIVE OPTION

00:36:49,274 --> 00:36:52,477
FOR YOU GUYS, BECAUSE I'VE SEEN
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING.

00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:59,084
SO FAR, I'VE GOT ORDERS
FROM 47 COUNTRIES.

00:36:59,084 --> 00:37:01,252
I GOTTA TELL YOU,
IT GROWS ON YOU.

00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:03,388
WHEN YOU FIRST SHOWED IT
TO US,

00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:06,958
I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY
AND WEIRD.
I USE IT IN NEW YORK, OKAY,
AND I'VE HAD PEOPLE

00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:10,962
COME UP TO ME AND SAY, "WHERE
DID YOU GET THAT?" YOU KNOW?
HAVE YOU TALKED
TO ANY RETAILERS AT ALL?

00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:14,299
I HAVEN'T. I, YOU KNOW, I‐‐
SO YOU HAVE BLOWN OFF

00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:16,367
THE TRADITIONAL DISTRIBUTION
CHANNEL COMPLETELY.

00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:19,070
I GET HUNDREDS OF INQUIRIES,
WHOLESALE,

00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,372
FROM OUTSIDE OF THE U. S.

00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:24,876
WHAT‐‐WHAT ARE YOU DOING
FOR A LIVING RIGHT NOW?
I'M DOING THIS RIGHT NOW.

00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:27,979
SO YOU'RE PROFITABLE, IN REGARDS
TO YOU PAYING YOUR OWN BILLS?
NO. I'VE BEEN GETTING FUNDED,

00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:32,917
STILL, INTERNALLY FROM FAMILY
ON THE THING.
OH, THEY MUST LOVE YOU.

00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:36,354
THEY DON'T REALLY WANT
TO TALK TO ME ANYMORE.
(sharks laugh)

00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:39,758
(Barbara) ALAN, I'M GONNA, UH,
I'M GONNA‐‐
I LOVE THIS GUY. HE'S HONEST.

00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:43,461
(Daymond)
NO, HE'S AN HONEST GUY.
WITH DUE RESPECT, I THINK
IT'S A GREAT SPORTS UMBRELLA.

00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:45,930
I THINK IT NEEDS
THAT SPORTS ANGLE.
RIGHT.

00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,966
BUT IN LIEU
OF THE STANDARD UMBRELLA,

00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:50,602
I DON'T THINK
IT'S EVER GONNA BE A GO.
IT'S‐‐IT'S, YOU KNOW,
I NEVER DESIGNED THIS

00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:53,304
TO REALLY COMPETE
WITH THE UMBRELLA.

00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:56,141
TO ME, IT'S A NEW LINE ITEM.
(Barbara) BUT EITHER WAY,
I'M OUT.

00:37:56,141 --> 00:37:58,143
ALAN, UH, I GIVE YOU
ALL THE CREDIT.

00:37:58,143 --> 00:38:01,146
YOU CAME OUT HERE, AND YOU TOOK
A VERY ODD‐LOOKING THING

00:38:01,146 --> 00:38:04,182
THAT MADE ME LAUGH AND CONVINCED
ME YOU'VE GOT A REAL BUSINESS.

00:38:04,182 --> 00:38:07,118
BUT AS FAR AS MYSELF, THOUGH,
I'M OUT.

00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:11,456
ALAN, I‐I‐I LIKE THE PRODUCT.

00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:14,125
I‐I ALWAYS LOOK FOR SOMETHING
THAT'S VERY UNIQUE

00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,394
AND NOTHING LIKE IT
IN THE MARKETPLACE,

00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:18,163
BUT I HAVE A CHALLENGE

00:38:18,163 --> 00:38:20,999
WITH THE‐‐THE AMOUNT OF MONEY
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR‐‐

00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:22,734
UH, $200,000 FOR 25%.

00:38:22,734 --> 00:38:25,837
THE BEST DEAL I COULD
COME UP WITH WOULD BE 200 GRAND,

00:38:25,837 --> 00:38:28,973
UH, FOR 65% OF THE COMPANY.

00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,509
YOU KNOW WHAT REALLY MAKES
ME MAD IS THAT HARRINGTON

00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:34,512
HAS HIS OWN DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL
WITH THIS TV STUFF.
YEAH, I KNOW.

00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:37,782
IT JUST REALLY PISSES ME OFF...
THANK YOU.

00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:40,318
BECAUSE I CAN'T
COMPETE WITH THAT.
(laughs)

00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:43,721
LIKE, IT'S A REAL PROBLEM.
I MEAN...
ARE‐‐ARE YOU IN?

00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:46,157
NO. I'M OUT.

00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,992
I'VE MADE ALAN AN OFFER.

00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:51,296
I NEVER GOT A YES, A NO,
A MAYBE, A WHATEVER.
THAT'S TRUE.

00:38:51,296 --> 00:38:53,231
I MEAN‐‐
UH, WELL... (clears throat)

00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:55,967
I GUESS, WITH, YOU KNOW,
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:58,369
I THINK THE EQUITY IS
JUST A LITTLE BIT TOO HIGH.

00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:00,371
SO THAT'S A NO?

00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:04,576
YEAH. I THINK
I COULD GO AS HIGH AS 35%.

00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:06,511
OUCH.

00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:09,781
NO. THAT WOULD NEVER WORK
FOR ME.
MM‐HMM.

00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:18,590
KEVIN KNOWS HOW TO BRAND YOU
TO THE EVERYDAY CONSUMER,

00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:21,125
AND I KNOW HOW TO DO IT
THROUGH RETAIL AS WELL AS GROW

00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:23,795
THIS EXTREME WEATHER GEAR
TO A BIGGER PROGRAM.

00:39:23,795 --> 00:39:26,164
I DON'T MIND
GETTING IN WITH KEVIN,

00:39:26,164 --> 00:39:29,500
BECAUSE I THINK THAT BOTH OF US
ADD CERTAIN AREAS.

00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,938
YOU CAN GET BOTH OF US
FOR 60% OF THE COMPANY.

00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:37,208
W‐WE'D PUT THE $200,000 UP.
YOU'D HAVE 2 PARTNERS...

00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,277
RIGHT.
30% APIECE.

00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:41,613
60%‐‐HIS RETAIL POWER,

00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:43,781
MY TELEVISION POWER,
TOGETHER,

00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:47,552
TO TAKE THIS THING
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

00:39:50,255 --> 00:39:52,790
I REALLY WANT YOU GUYS IN.
(laughs)

00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,126
I THINK YOU'RE BOTH GONNA,
YOU KNOW,

00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:57,762
REALLY ADD A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT
OF VALUE.

00:39:57,762 --> 00:40:00,164
UM, I THINK
IT'S A LITTLE RICH.

00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,600
WOULD YOU ACCEPT 50%
FOR THAT PRICE?

00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:07,572
50%?

00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:11,342
WE SAID 60%.

00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:14,913

I'M ABOUT TO MAKE IT RAIN

00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:10,201
WE WOULD LIKE TO STATE IT VERY
CLEARLY‐‐$200,000 FOR 51%...

RIGHT. WHAT DOES THE 51% MEAN
TO YOU? YOU WANT CONTROL.
(O'Leary) I REALLY LIKE
THESE GUYS.

00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:19,477
WE WOULD LIKE TO CONTROL
BECAUSE OUR MONEY IS AT RISK

00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:22,313
MANUFACTURING AND PRODUCING
THE PRODUCT.

00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,315
RIGHT. MY CONCERN IS,
YOU KNOW,

00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,317
IF IT'S SOMETHING
THAT DOES RAMP UP,

00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,519
IT COULD NE‐‐IT COULD NEED
ADDITIONAL CAPITAL,

00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:31,789
AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE
THAT'S GONNA COME FROM IF‐‐
YOU WON'T NEED THAT.

00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:33,524
YOU DON'T THINK SO?

00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:35,693
YOU WON'T NEED IT,
BECAUSE, UH, AS LONG AS‐‐

00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:37,695
THIS IS WHY I'M SAYING IT‐‐

00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:40,865
IF YOU CAN SHOW ME VALID ORDERS
FROM A RETAILER...
YEAH.

00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:45,403
THEN I CAN FINANCE EVERYTHING...

00:41:45,403 --> 00:41:47,105
FOREVER.

00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:49,240
AND MY ROLE WOULD BE?

00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:53,978
YOU'RE GONNA KEEP RUNNING
THE BUSINESS, YOU KNOW.
RUNNING THE BUSINESS.

00:41:56,714 --> 00:42:00,852
ALAN, I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:03,788
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S A TOUGH DECISION.
IT IS A TOUGH DECISION,
BUT YOU GOTTA MAKE IT.

00:42:03,788 --> 00:42:05,690
(Robert) SO, ALAN...

00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:11,662
ALL RIGHT, LOOK IT. I'LL LIVE
AND DIE WITH YOU GUYS.

00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:14,232
YOU GOT A DEAL.
WE GOT IT. GOOD.

00:42:14,232 --> 00:42:17,001
ALL RIGHT. OKAY, GOOD JOB.
THANKS, ALAN.
OKAY.

00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:20,004
OKAY.
I LOOK FORWARD
TO WORKING WITH YOU.

00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:22,373
OKAY, BUDDY. GOOD JOB.

00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,376
(Robert) WOW.
YOU GUYS SLAUGHTERED HIM.
YOU SLAUGHTERED HIM.

00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:28,980
WE LEFT HIM AS MUCH MEAT
ON THE BONE THAT HE COULD HAVE.
YOU‐‐HEY.

00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,749
HE TOLD YOU THE TRUTH,
AND YOU USED IT AGAINST HIM.

00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:34,619
I ASHAMED OF YOU.
THE GUY‐‐THE GUY'S A WORKER.
I LIKE HIM.

00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:36,721
WE'RE GONNA MAKE A‐A COMPANY
OUT OF THIS.

00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:39,724
I PROBABLY NEVER WOULD HAVE SOLD
51% OF THIS COMPANY

00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:41,726
IF IT WASN'T FOR DAYMOND
AND KEVIN.

00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:44,162
YOU KNOW, WHAT THEY‐‐
WHAT THEY BRING TO THE PARTY

00:42:44,162 --> 00:42:46,798
IS REALLY MORE SIGNIFICANT TO ME
THAN THE MONEY

00:42:46,798 --> 00:42:48,833
TO MAKE THIS THING HAPPEN.
