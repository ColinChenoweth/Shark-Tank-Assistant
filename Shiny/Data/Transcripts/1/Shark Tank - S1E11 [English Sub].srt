00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,667
(O'Leary) THAT IS
A GOOD‐LOOKING BOBBLE DOLL.

00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,135
(Barbara laughs)

00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,071
LISTEN, JEFF,
SO FAR, GOOD SUCKING UP.
THANK YOU.

00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,707
CLIENTS CAN PROVIDE
A PHOTOGRAPH TO US.

00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:23,243
WE WILL HAND SCULPT THE DOLL
TO RESEMBLE IT.

00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:24,978
THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS,

00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,147
THEY CAN ACTUALLY
SEE THE DOLL AS IT'S BEING MADE.

00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,916
WE'LL PROVIDE PHOTO PROOFS
OF THE SCULPTED HEAD.

00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,486
THEY GET TO APPROVE IT
OR EVEN MAKE CHANGES IF NEEDED.

00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,488
IT'S EXCITING
AND IT'S FUN FOR THE CLIENTS.

00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,223
WHAT I'M LOOKING TO DO

00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,225
WITH THE‐‐WITH THE MONEY
THAT I'M ASKING FOR

00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:41,628
IS TO BRING THESE TO PHYSICAL
LOCATIONS WITHIN SHOPPING MALLS,

00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:43,630
AMUSEMENT PARKS,
EVEN NATIONAL CHAIN STORES.

00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,833
SO YOU WANT A RETAIL LOCATION
THAT SELLS BOBBLEHEAD DOLLS?

00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,802
IT'S LIKE A KIOSK LOCATION

00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:50,904
WHERE THE CLIENT
CAN ACTUALLY WALK IN.

00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:53,774
THEY CAN SELECT FROM OVER
100 DIFFERENT BODY STYLES

00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:55,809
THAT WE OFFER‐‐
HERE'S JUST A FEW.

00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:58,111
THEN THEY CAN SUPPLY
A PHOTOGRAPH TO US

00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:00,414
OR WE CAN TAKE THEIR PHOTO.

00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:03,083
AND THEN THAT'S WHEN
THAT PROCESS BEINGS.
IS THIS AN EXISTING BUSINESS,
JEFF?

00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,085
UH, IT IS A COMPANY
THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE AS WELL,

00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:07,688
IT'S A SEPARATE COMPANY. IT'S
AN ONLINE BUSINESS CURRENTLY.

00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,057
AND IS THAT BUSINESS
GENERATING REVENUE?
YES, IT IS.

00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:14,027
HOW MUCH IS THAT?
UH, REVENUES, IN A YEARLY
FASHION, OF SEVEN FIGURES.

00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,097
BUT WAIT A MINUTE. WHY ARE‐‐WHY
ARE WE NOT INVESTING IN THAT?

00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:20,734
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
LET'S‐‐LET'S GET RIGHT TO THIS.

00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,703
HOW LONG HAS THE BUSINESS
BEEN OUT?
FIVE YEARS.

00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,938
THIS IS GONNA BE ANOTHER
DIVISION OF THAT BUSINESS?

00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:29,209
IT'S GONNA BE A SEPARATE
DIVISION OF THAT BUSINESS.
AND YOU WANT US
TO INVEST $75,000

00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,578
FOR 18% OF THIS NEW BUSINESS?
THAT'S CORRECT.

00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:34,281
WHY WOULD I INVEST
IN A BUSINESS OF VAPOR

00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:36,583
WHEN I CAN GET A PIECE
OF A <i>REAL</i> COMPANY?

00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,019
WELL, AT THIS POINT, WE ARE
OFFERING JUST THE BOBBLE PLACE.

00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:41,021
IT'S A SEPARATE ENTITY.
YOU MEAN THE VAPOR BUSINESS.

00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:44,558
IF YOU HAVE A REAL BUSINESS, WHY
ARE YOU KEEPING THAT FROM US?

00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,560
OH, IT'S NOT KEEPING.
IT'S A SEPARATE DIVISION.
TELL US THE SALES.

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,396
IT‐‐IT'S A 7‐DIGIT BUSINESS.
BUT WHAT'S THE NUMBER?

00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,565
(Barbara) WHAT IS IT?
(Daymond) WHAT SEVEN DIGITS?

00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,801
WHAT'S THE NUMBER? IS IT
$1 MILLION? IS IT $10 MILLION?
IT'S OVER $1 MILLION A YEAR.

00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:58,505
YEAH, BABY!
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
ALL RIGHT! THERE WE GO.

00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:02,576
(Daymond) AND HOW MUCH OF THAT
ARE WE GETTING?
WELL, AGAIN, I'M OFFERING
A SEPARATE DIVISION WHICH WILL

00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:05,579
THEN UTILIZE THE FACTORY
IN WHICH WE CURRENTLY RUN

00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:09,049
TO CREATE THESE DOLLS.
SO I GET TO HAVE THE HIGHER‐RISK
LOCATION, BRICK‐AND‐MORTAR IDEA,

00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:11,384
AND YOU KEEP THE SUCCULENT,
HIGH‐MARGIN ONLINE BUSINESS.

00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:13,954
WHY DON'T YOU
GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO TALK

00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:16,456
ABOUT THE OTHER BUSINESS?
WHAT'S THE KIOSK GONNA COST?

00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:19,559
HOW MUCH MONEY CAN YOU MAKE?
WHAT'S THE TRAFFIC ON A KIOSK?

00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,762
(O'Leary) WAIT A SECOND.
WAIT A SECOND.
DON'T. GIVE HIM A CHANCE.

00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,030
LET'S HEAR ABOUT
THE OTHER SIDE BEFORE YOU...
I'D LIKE HIM TO START

00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,833
BY SAYING AND APOLOGIZING
FOR BEING SO GREEDY.

00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,402
WELL, IT'S NOT REALLY GREEDY.
(O'Leary) YES,
IT'S VERY GREEDY.

00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:32,172
IT'S NOT GREEDY
BECAUSE WHAT I'M DOING IS,

00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:34,808
I'M GIVING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR
YOU TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL MONEY

00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:37,144
KNOWING THAT AN ONLINE BUSINESS
IS MAKING SEVEN FIGURES.

00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:41,815
THE PRODUCT HAS BEEN PROVEN
IN SEPARATE SALES DIVISIONS.
BUT YOU'RE NOT GIVING ME
ANY OF THE EXISTING PRODUCT.

00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:43,650
YOU'RE ASKING ME
TO TAKE ALL THE RISK

00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,520
AND GIVING ME
NONE OF THE BENEFIT.

00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,423
HOW CAN YOU DO THAT?
YOU'RE ON A VERY, VERY SLIPPERY
SLOPE AT THIS MOMENT WITH US.

00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:54,327
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO RETHINK
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA OFFER US

00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:57,164
IN THE EXISTING BUSINESS.
BECAUSE WHY HAVE ME

00:04:57,164 --> 00:05:00,967
IN A PARTNER‐‐IN SOMETHING I
DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GONNA WORK?
BUT, DAYMOND,

00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,004
HE'S NOT OFFERING YOU
ANY OF THE EXISTING BUSINESS.

00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:06,139
(Daymond) WELL, I WANT HIM
TO RETHINK THAT.

00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:10,043
ARE YOU WILLING TO GIVE US
SOME INSURANCE ON OUR MONEY

00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:13,079
WITH YOUR EXISTING BUSINESS?

00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,081
IT WOULD REALLY DEPEND

00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:17,784
ON WHAT KIND OF INSURANCE
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:21,822
I WOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE
GIVING A LARGER PERCENTAGE

00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,191
ON THIS "VAPOR BUSINESS"‐‐
WHICH IS TRULY A BUSINESS‐‐

00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:26,193
AND A SMALLER PERCENTAGE
POSSIBLY

00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:28,495
ON THE MORE GUARANTEED
BUSINESS.

00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,097
JEFF, PLEASE,
TELL US ABOUT THE KIOSKS.

00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,732
GIVE US SOME NUMBERS.

00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:35,202
GENERALLY, YOU CAN RENT
A KIOSK FROM A MALL.
(Barbara) MM‐HMM.

00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:38,271
USUALLY IT'S A $1,500 FEE
PER MONTH.

00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,441
OR SEASONALLY
IT COULD BE UP TO $3,000.
THAT'S SUBSTANTIAL.

00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,944
WHAT WOULD AN AVERAGE KIOSK
GENERATE IN SALES

00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,445
IN A TYPICAL MALL?

00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:48,515
WELL, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S REALLY HARD TO SAY.

00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,517
SO IF YOU CAN'T
BREAK OUT THAT DATA,

00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,320
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT THIS IS
A GOOD OPPORTUNITY?

00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,623
WELL, I THINK‐‐I THINK THAT
WE'RE MISSING A BIG AUDIENCE.

00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:58,625
MANY PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW

00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,261
THAT A SINGLE DOLL
CAN BE MADE TO LOOK LIKE THEM

00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:03,396
FOR LESS THAN $100.

00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,398
WHAT'S THE PROFIT
IN YOUR EXISTING BUSINESS?

00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:09,469
BETWEEN $500,000 AND $600,000
PROFIT PER YEAR.
(Robert) OKAY, SO‐‐

00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:12,138
YEAH! WHAT ARE YOU EVEN THINKING
ABOUT GOING INTO A MALL FOR?

00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:14,941
BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE MISSING‐‐
SEE, WHAT YOU'RE NOT HEARING‐‐

00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:17,777
WE'RE MISSING THE PEOPLE
THAT DO NOT KNOW THIS EXISTS.

00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,279
IT DOESN'T MATTER!

00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:22,148
YOU'VE GOT A BUSINESS THAT'S
MAKING A PHENOMENAL PROFIT.

00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:25,318
I UNDERSTAND, BUT IT NEEDS‐‐
I FORBID YOU TO EVER EVEN THINK
ABOUT GOING INTO A MALL.

00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:27,854
BUT LIKE ANY BUSINESS,
YOU NEED TO TAKE THAT NEXT STEP.

00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:31,958
YOU NEED TO, LIKE‐‐
I HAVE TO PUT YOUR MONEY
IN PROTECTIVE CUSTODY FROM YOU.

00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:36,129
I'LL GIVE $75,000 FOR 18%
OF THE EXISTING BUSINESS,

00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:39,266

00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:46,439

ARE YOU TAKING MY DEAL OR NOT?
I WOULD NOT TAKE THAT DEAL.

00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:53,380
WHY NOT?
BECAUSE I DON'T NEED THE MONEY
FOR MY ONLINE BUSINESS.

00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:57,083
SO WHAT ARE YOU HERE FOR?
I'M HERE TO EXPAND AND BRING
THE PRODUCTS TO CONSUMERS‐‐

00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,719
NO, YOU'RE HERE
TO PUT MY MONEY IN HARM'S WAY

00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,788

00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,791

EVERY TIME YOU MENTION "MALL"‐‐
200 VOLTS. WHAMMO.

00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:24,077
EVERY TIME YOU MENTION
THE WORD "KIOSK"...

LET ME SPEAK.

00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:25,979
YOU GET A SHOCK.

00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:29,082

00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:38,458
TO EVER MENTION
THE IDEA OF A MALL.

00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,460
LET ME THROW THIS AT YOU,
IF I MAY.

00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,697
WHAT VALUE DO I HAVE TO TAKE
$75,000 ON AN EXISTING BUSINESS

00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:46,833
THAT DOESN'T NEED $75,000?
YOU'RE SITTING ON MY CARPET
ASKING FOR MONEY,

00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,002
AND I'M TELLING YOU
HOW I'D GIVE IT TO YOU.

00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:52,706

FOR AN UNTESTED BUSINESS.

00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:54,708
WELL, LET ME ASK YOU THIS.

00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:58,678
WOULD YOU CONSIDER TAKING
THE 18% OF THIS VAPOR COMPANY,

00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:00,914
AND THEN IF I GAVE YOU
MAYBE 5%

00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:03,516

WOULD YOU CONSIDER THAT?

00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:07,287
(Daymond) NOW, JEFF‐‐
OHH! I WANNA BUY THIS COMPANY
AND WHACK THIS GUY!

00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:10,290
JEFF, I JUST WANNA TELL YOU
WHERE I STAND.

00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,393
I LIKE THE IDEA,
BUT NOT THE KIOSK IDEA.

00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:16,162
GREED <i>IS</i> GOOD,

00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,231
BUT WE NEED
TO BE GREEDY TOGETHER.

00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:23,436
AND VERY FEW PEOPLE HAVE EVER
WALKED UP TO ME AND TOLD ME

00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,905
THAT THEY WERE GONNA USE
MY MONEY FOR JUST THEIR BENEFIT

00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:27,540
AND NOT <i>OUR</i> BENEFIT.

00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,943
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,

00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:32,979

SO WITH THAT...

00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:38,418

00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:40,453
THE BOTTOM LINE IS,
THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:43,289
YOU'RE ASKING FOR TO TEST
SOMETHING IS WAY OVERBOARD.

00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,026

00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,728

00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:59,039
"OH, THE OTHER BUSINESS
ISN'T INCLUDED."

00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,441
I FELT A LITTLE TRICKED.

00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:03,676
AND I THINK THAT'S A TERRIBLE
WAY TO START A RELATIONSHIP.

00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:06,312
SO FOR THAT REASON ALONE,
I'M OUT.

00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:09,949
JEFF, LET ME GO BACK
TO THE ORIGINAL BUSINESS.

00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:12,352

OF THE ORIGINAL?

00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:15,655
BETWEEN $500,000 AND $600,000.
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE
AN ACTUAL NUMBER?

00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:18,525
WHY IS IT "BETWEEN $500,000
AND $600,000"?

00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:20,527
WELL, IT‐‐IT JUST DEPENDS
ON, UM, WHICH YEAR WE WERE IN

00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:23,396
WHERE WE WE'RE AT.
WHAT KIND OF AN ACCOUNTANT
DO YOU USE?

GIVES ME PRETTY HARD NUMBERS,

AND MY GRAPHIC DESIGN
BACKGROUND,

00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,122
WE CREATED A PRODUCT WHICH
NOT ONLY SOLVES THE PROBLEM

00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,891

00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:14,393

00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:18,497
OF KEEPING THEIR MP3 PLAYER
OR SMARTPHONE SAFE.
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:21,601
YOU PUT YOUR MP3 PLAYER
IN THIS PROTECTIVE SLEEVE.

00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,636
YOU POP THIS RUBBER PART OUT.

00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:28,007
AND YOU SIMPLY WRAP AND UNWRAP
YOUR HEADPHONES JUST LIKE THAT.

00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:29,675

YEAH, YOU HAVE TO‐‐RIGHT,

OH, I SEE. OKAY. OKAY.

00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:07,847
IT'S REALLY DURABLE,

DO YOU HAVE A PATENT ON THIS?

IT'S A REALLY, REALLY SIMPLE
LITTLE‐‐LITTLE DEVICE.

ON THIS PIECE.

00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,841
SO THIS PIECE ACTUALLY HAS
A DIFFERENT PURPOSE.

00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:11,977

TO THEM UH, THE MP3 CASE.

00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:15,981
(O'Leary) YEAH.
AND, UM, SO NOW IT'S A DIFFERENT
PRODUCT ALL TOGETHER.

00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,951
WHAT'S IT SELL FOR?
IT SELLS FOR $18.

00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,554
AND WE'VE SOLD OVER 5,000
OF THESE,

00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,523
AND WE'VE MADE EVERY SINGLE ONE
OF THEM OURSELVES

00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:27,426
IN OUR APARTMENT.
WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE IT?

00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:29,628
IT COSTS $3
FOR US TO MAKE IT.
OKAY.

00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:32,231
THAT DOESN'T PAY FOR YOUR OWN
LABOR. THAT'S FOR FREE, RIGHT?

00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,233
THAT'S JUST MATERIALS?
YES. YES.

00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,268
YEAH, EXACTLY.
AT THIS POINT IT'S FREE.
YEAH.

00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:38,404

MAKING THESE THINGS AT HOME.

00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,206

DO YOU HAVE

ON WHAT IT WOULD COST
TO MANUFACTURE THIS PRODUCT?

00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,011
BECAUSE IF YOU DO GET INTO
ONE OF THESE OUTLETS,

00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:48,514

OR MILLIONS OF THESE.

OH, NO.

00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:08,567
ROMAN, MY KIDS
WOULDN'T BUY THIS.

00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,569
AND THE REASON
THEY WOULDN'T BUY IT IS,

00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:12,805

TO THEM IS THE SKIN

00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:16,709

00:25:56,355 --> 00:25:59,124
(laughing)

00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:02,694
AND CLIPS ON
TO YOUR WAISTBAND.

00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:05,130
THIS ALLOWS THE TOWEL
TO DRAPE OVER YOU.
(Daymond) I'M SORRY?

00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:08,033
CAN YOU GET STUCK?
WHAT?

00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:11,170
NOBODY'S COMPLAINED YET,
BUT IT IS THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL

00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:14,073
RIGHT NOW.
HOW IS BARBARA GONNA USE
THIS? SHE LOVES GOLFING.

00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:17,509
HOW'S SHE GONNA USE
THIS DEVICE?
YOU KNOW, TO MAKE A‐A UroClub
FOR A WOMAN,

00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:20,479
I'D HAVE TO MAKE A WHOLE
POP‐UP TENT WITH AN ATTENDANT,

00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:22,714
I THINK,
TO TAKE YOU TO THE BATHROOM.
(laughs)

00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:25,751
(Daymond) AND YOU WOULD NEED
SEVERAL OF 'EM, AND‐‐
THE GUY
TAKES OUT THE CLUB AND‐‐

00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:29,054
AND SAYS, "EXCUSE ME,
KEVIN AND DAYMOND AND KEVIN..."
SURE.

00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:31,190
"I HAVE TO GO USE MY CLUB"?

00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:34,393
LISTEN, YOU'RE 125 YARDS
FROM THE GREEN,

00:26:34,393 --> 00:26:36,595
AND YOU HAVE TO URINATE.

00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,998
YOU TAKE OUT YOUR UroClub.
YOU RELIEVE YOURSELF.

00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:43,068
YOU PUT YOUR UroClub AWAY.
RIGHT IN PUBLIC
WITHOUT BEING BEHIND A TREE?

00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,404
I DON'T USE THE UroClub
TO MAKE THE SHOT.
NO, NO, NO.

00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:48,740
IT IS NOT A FUNCTIONAL CLUB.
FLOYD, WELL,
WHEN I WAS ON THE GOLF COURSE,

00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,176
I‐I NOTICED
THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE

00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:53,178
ARE DRINKING
AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT.

00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:57,349
SO I THINK THAT THEY WOULD
TOP THAT THING OFF RIGHT AWAY,

00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:59,351
AND YOU WOULD NEED
SEVERAL OF 'EM.

00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:01,520
LET ME JUST TELL YOU THAT THE‐‐
THE CLUB HOLDS ABOUT 18 OUNCES,

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,689
WHICH, AS A UROLOGIST,
I CAN TELL YOU

00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:07,059
IS MORE THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON
URINATES AT A GIVEN TIME.

00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:08,560
REALLY?
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,829
IT JUST SEEMS SO SMALL.
IT'S NOT A PERFECT SOLUTION.

00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:13,565
UH, IT'S NOT MADE TO, UH,
ELIMINATE BATHROOMS

00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:15,534
AND THE NEED TO URINATE.

00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:17,369
CAN I SEE IT?
ABSOLUTELY.

00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,338
FLOYD, WHAT MADE YOU
THINK OF IT?

00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:21,406
OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE A UROLOGIST.

00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:23,809
BUT WHAT WAS IN YOUR HEAD
THE DAY YOU SAID...
(snaps fingers)

00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:26,478
"HEY, I HAVE AN IDEA"?
THE REAL ANSWER TO THIS,
AND THIS IS THE TRUE STORY,

00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,480
A PATIENT CAME BACK TO ME

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,849
SEVERAL MONTHS AFTER
AN OPERATION, AND HE TOLD ME

00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:32,851
BECAUSE OF HIS URINARY
FREQUENCY, HE HAD TO CONSTANTLY

00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:35,420
SLICE THE BALL INTO THE WOODS
TO RELIEVE HIMSELF.

00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,123
AND HE SAID
AFTER THE PROCEDURE,

00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:40,926
IT TOOK MORE STROKES OFF
HIS GAME THAN ANY CLUB HE BOUGHT

00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:43,495
IN THE LAST FEW YEARS.
(Harrington) I'M A GOLFER.
I WOULD NEVER BUY THIS.

00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,998
THIS IS A GAG GIFT, OKAY.
DON'T YOU SELL 'EM AS GAG GIFTS?

00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,700
I THINK IT'S GOT
GREAT NOVELTY POTENTIAL.

00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,735
OH.

00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:51,737
I‐I‐I ALWAYS LOOK AT IT
THIS WAY.

00:27:51,737 --> 00:27:54,139
ITS HUMOROUS, IT'S PRACTICAL,
AND IT'S WELL PRICED.

00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,241
WHAT IS THE PRICE?
WHAT'S THE PRICE?

00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:58,243
THE GOING PRICE RIGHT NOW
IS $24.95

00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:01,046
PLUS, UH, $9.95
SHIPPING AND HANDLING.
WHAT'S IT COST YOU TO MAKE IT?

00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:05,717
IT COST ME $8.43
TO‐‐TO MAKE IT.
(Robert) HOW MANY HAVE‐‐
HOW MANY HAVE YOU SOLD, FLOYD?

00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:08,120
ABOUT 3,000.
(Barbara) I'M NOT TOUCHING
THE TOP. YOU CAN TOUCH IT.

00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,822
WOW.
HANG ON A SEC.
YOU'VE SOLD 3,000?

00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:12,491
YEAH.
H‐HOW?

00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:15,194
WELL, I LIVE IN‐‐IN, UH,
IN SOUTH FLORIDA,

00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:17,663
AND I‐I MADE
A‐AN INFOMERCIAL COMMERCIAL

00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:19,965
THAT WAS ON
SOME LOCAL STATIONS.
WHAT WERE YOUR SALES?

00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:22,634
UH, OVER $70,000...
WOW.

00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:24,102
IN GROSS REVENUE.
THAT'S AMAZING.

00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:26,038
YOU'RE DOING BUSINESS
ON THE WEB WITH THIS?

00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:28,040
YES, I HAVE A WEB SITE,

00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,209
AND THAT'S WHERE A LOT
OF MY BUSINESS HAS COME FROM,

00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,744
THROUGH THE WEB.
HOW MUCH OF YOUR OWN MONEY
IS IN THIS?

00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:34,846
UH, A LITTLE OVER $300,000.
WOW!

00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:38,383
THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY.
HOW COULD YOU SPEND $300,000
ON A PEE PEE POLE?

00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,720
HOW'S THAT POSSIBLE?
WELL, I HAD 15,000
INITIALLY IN STOCK.

00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,824
THIS IS TRADEMARKED, AND IT'S,
UH, THE PATENT IS PENDING.

00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:48,327
AND I THINK YOU GUYS KNOW
WHAT‐‐WHAT THAT CAN RUN.
YEAH.

00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:51,496
HOW MUCH INVENTORY DO YOU HAVE?
RIGHT NOW I HAVE 12,000 UNITS.

00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:54,600
FLOYD, IF YOU STAND
IN THE MIDDLE OF A FAIRWAY...
MM‐HMM.

00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,969
EVEN WITH THE, UH,
GREEN TOWEL,

00:28:56,969 --> 00:28:59,438
AND YOU AERATE YOUR PACKAGE...

00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:03,508
(laughs)
IS THAT NOT INDECENT EXPOSURE
IN SOME COUNTIES?

00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:05,510
I DON'T THINK IT IS.
BUT I THINK THAT

00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,980
WHEN YOU'RE ON A GOLF COURSE,
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,982
SO IT'S GONNA HAPPEN
EITHER IN THE WOODS

00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:12,284
OR IT'S GONNA HAPPEN
A LITTLE BIT MORE CONCEALED.

00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:14,753
FLOYD, UM,
THE HIDDEN THING HERE

00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:18,156
IS THAT THE FACT THAT YOU'RE
ASKING FOR $25,000 FOR 51%.

00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:20,592
YOU'RE A‐‐YOU'RE A DOCTOR.
YOU DON'T NEED THE MONEY.

00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,362
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A STRATEGIC
RELATIONSHIP OBVIOUSLY.
EXACTLY.

00:29:23,362 --> 00:29:26,031
AND, UM, I WOULDN'T KNOW
HOW TO MARKET THAT.

00:29:26,031 --> 00:29:28,333
I DO LIKE TO CALL MYSELF
"THE BRAND WHISPERER,"

00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,269
BUT I WOULDN'T KNOW
HOW TO MARKET THAT.

00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:33,272
SO WITH THAT SAID,
I'M OUT.
OKAY.

00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:36,174
AND IF YOU THINK, UH, HE DOESN'T
KNOW HOW TO MARKET IT...
(laughs)

00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:39,278
I‐I OBVIOUSLY CAN'T RELATE
TO THIS PARTICULAR PRODUCT,

00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:42,214
SO I'M OUT.

00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:47,552
I‐I CANNOT SEE ME... (chuckles)
UM, UTILIZING THAT DEVICE

00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:49,488
UNDER ANY SITUATION.

00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:53,692
I CAN'T INVEST IN SOMETHING
I WOULD NEVER USE. I'M OUT.

00:29:53,692 --> 00:29:55,494
IT'S A VERY INTRIGUING
PRODUCT.

00:29:55,494 --> 00:29:58,130
AND, UM, YOU KNOW,
BUT AS AN INVESTMENT,

00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,600
I JUST DON'T SEE IT
FITTING INTO MY PORTFOLIO,

00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,568
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:05,570
DO YOU SEE YOUR PORTFOLIO
FITTING <i>INTO</i> THE INVESTMENT?

00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:08,874
I THINK MY PORTFOLIO MAY HAVE
A PROBLEM GETTING INSIDE THAT.
(laughs)

00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:10,976
ANYWAYS, UH, FLOYD, I'M OUT.

00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:15,380
I LOOK AT IT AS A PRODUCT
THAT DOES HAVE SOME POTENTIAL,

00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:18,950
AS‐‐AS A NOVELTY,
GAG‐TYPE PRODUCT.

00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,853
AND, UH, THERE'S A LOT
OF GOLF WEB SITES OUT THERE.

00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:24,389
THERE'S‐‐AT CHRISTMASTIME,
EVERYONE'S LOOKING FOR,

00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:27,025
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING TO BUY
FOR THAT‐‐THAT SPECIAL GOLFER.

00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:30,462
THIS IS THE DEAL
THAT I WOULD MAKE YOU.

00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:32,864
YOU'VE GOT A TV COMMERCIAL.
YOU'VE GOT INVENTORY.

00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:36,268
I WOULD GIVE YOU THE $25,000
FOR 70% OF THE COMPANY.

00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:39,171
YOU'RE GONNA BUY
THE PEE PEE POLE? WOW.

00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:41,940
SO IT'S 70%?
FOR $25,000.

00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,479
I LOVE IT.

00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:49,681
OKAY. (claps hands)
SUPER, RIGHT? ALL RIGHTY.
(O'Leary) CONGRATULATIONS.

00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,851
NOT IN A MILLION YEARS...
(Daymond) CONGRATULATIONS.

00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,520
DID I THINK THE PEE PEE POLE
WOULD GET A DEAL.
(Barbara laughs)

00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,290
(O'Leary) OKAY, NOW BOTH OF YOU
WASH YOUR HANDS.
(sharks laugh)

00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,359
I WAS HAPPY WITH THE DEAL.

00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:03,695
I WAS ACTUALLY WILLING TO TAKE
EVEN LESS BECAUSE I KNOW

00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,631
THAT KEVIN CAN MAKE THIS PRODUCT
A HUGE SUCCESS.

DURING THE HIGH SCHOOL
ATHLETIC RECRUITING PROCESS.

00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:01,353
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF
HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETES EACH YEAR

00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:03,955
WHO NEVER ATTRACT THE ATTENTION
OF COLLEGE COACHES

00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:07,325
AND ARE OVERLOOKED.
JumpForward EMPOWERS
HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETES AND PARENTS

00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:09,327
TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE ROUT‐‐
THE RECRUITING PROCESS

00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:11,797
INTO THEIR OWN HANDS.

00:32:11,797 --> 00:32:14,366
WE DO THIS BY PROVIDING THEM
AN ONLINE PROFILE

00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:17,469
THAT ENABLES THEM TO UPLOAD
PICTURES, VIDEOS AND STATISTICS

00:32:17,469 --> 00:32:19,671
TO MARKET THEMSELVES
TO COLLEGES.

00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:21,940
AT THE SAME TIME,
COLLEGE COACHES CAN NOW SEARCH

00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,676
THROUGH TENS OF THOUSANDS
OF ATHLETIC PROFILES

00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:28,413
TO FIND THOSE ATHLETES MOST
APPROPRIATE FOR THEIR PROGRAM.

00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:33,185
COLLEGE COACHES ARE UNDER STRICT
GUIDELINES FROM THE N. C. A. A.

00:32:33,185 --> 00:32:36,121
WITH REGARD TO COMMUNICATION
WITH HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETES.

00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:39,090
FOR EXAMPLE, COACHES ARE
ONLY ABLE TO MAKE ONE CALL

00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,560
TO CERTAIN HIGH SCHOOL
STUDENT PROSPECT ATHLETES.

00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:46,431
HOWEVER, COMPLIANCE VIOLATIONS
FOR INFRACTIONS ARE HUGE.

00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:49,434
I GET IT.
HOW DO I MAKE MONEY?

00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:51,436
CURRENTLY, THE COLLEGES PAY
A SUBSCRIPTION FEE.

00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:53,772
WE CHARGE BASED ON
THE LEVEL OF SCHOOL.

00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:55,607
THAT'S AN ANNUAL SUBSCRIPTION,

00:32:55,607 --> 00:32:58,310
PLUS WE CHARGE FEES FOR
MAINTENANCE AND, UH, CONSULTING.

00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,513
HAVE YOU SOLD

00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:04,015

I'LL TELL YOU THIS.

00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:32,878
WHAT DIFFERENTIATES US
FROM ALL OF THE COMPETITION

00:33:32,878 --> 00:33:35,981
IS THAT WE PROACTIVELY
PREVENT VIOLATIONS.

00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:38,149
WE'RE THE ONLY SOLUTION
IN THE MARKET THAT DOES THAT.

00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:40,785
COACHES OPERATE
FROM THE MOBILE PHONE.

00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:44,389
THE RULES AND REGULATIONS
ARE COMPLEX.

00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:46,391
AND WITH THE PROLIFERATION
OF COMMUNICATION OPTIONS‐‐

00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:48,360
JUST IN
THE LAST TWO YEARS ALONE‐‐

00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,129
COACHES WENT FROM JUST USING
THE PHONE AND SNAIL MAIL

00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:53,965
TO TEXT MESSAGING, Facebook
AND TWITTER.

00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,967
ALL OF THOSE RULES
AND REGULATIONS

00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:58,937
ARE ON OUR PROPRIETARY‐‐

THAT NONE OF YOUR COMPETITORS

00:33:58,937 --> 00:34:00,639
CAN INCORPORATE
THAT FUNCTIONALITY?

00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:02,641
NOBODY HAS IT TODAY.

00:34:02,641 --> 00:34:05,977
WE HAVE A PATENT
ON THE MOBILE APPLICATION.

00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:09,114
SO I PUT YOUR CLIENT
ON THE COACH'S BlackBerry.

00:34:09,114 --> 00:34:15,086
AND IF HE TEXTS OR E‐MAILS
OR CALLS THE SAME GREAT ATHLETE,

00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:17,522
AUTOMATICALLY, WHAT, A SCREEN
POPS UP AND SAYS "STOP"?

00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:20,358
YEAH. THERE'S CONFIRMATION
SO WE KNOW THAT, UM,

00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:21,860
THEY SAW THE MESSAGE.

00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,362
IF THEY GO AHEAD AND OVERRIDE
IT, THEY'VE SEEN THE MESSAGE

00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:27,599
AND THEY'VE MADE THE CONSCIOUS
DECISION TO OVERRIDE IT.

00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,668
(Barbara) YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
VERY SMART GUYS.

00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:33,705
YOU'VE THOUGHT THIS PRESENTATION
THROUGH. HERE'S WHAT I MISTRUST.

00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:36,441
I HAVE BUILT
TECHNOLOGY BUSINESSES.

00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:39,411
THEY'RE ALWAYS
TWICE AND THREE TIMES MORE

00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,313
THAN YOU EVER ENVISION.

00:34:41,313 --> 00:34:43,315
I'VE NEVER SEEN
A TECHNOLOGY BUSINESS

00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:45,283
NOT SPEND SO MUCH MORE
THAN THEY DICTATED.

00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:47,152
SO FOR THAT,
I'M DEFINITELY OUT

00:34:47,152 --> 00:34:49,721
'CAUSE I DON'T EVER WANT
TO MAKE THAT MISTAKE AGAIN.

00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:52,657
THIS IS HIGH‐TECH.
IT'S VERY RISKY.

00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:56,695
I'D BE AFRAID IF I PUT $150,000
INTO THIS COMPANY,

00:34:56,695 --> 00:34:59,931
THAT COULD BE GONE
IN THREE MONTHS.

00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:03,635
SO, UH, I'M OUT.

00:35:03,635 --> 00:35:05,236
BRIAN, ADAM,

00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:08,306
UM, YOU GUYS ARE WAY TOO SMART
FOR ME.

00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:12,510
IT'S A LITTLE COMPLICATED.
I'M OUT.

00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,546
<i>THREE SHARKS ARE OUT.</i>

00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:16,915
<i>ROBERT AND KEVIN O'LEARY</i>
<i>ARE THEIR LAST CHANCE.</i>

00:35:16,915 --> 00:35:19,317
BRIAN, DO YOU THINK YOUR VALUE
IS IN THE PATENT

00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:21,953
OR DO YOU THINK YOUR VALUE
IS GOING OUT TO MARKET

00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,688
AND GETTING CUSTOMERS?

00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:25,890
FIRST, I THINK WE HAVE
A STRONG, COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,892
BY BEING A FIRST MOVER
IN THE SPACE.

00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:30,562
TWO, I THINK WE HAVE
A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:32,564
IN HAVING A PATENT
ON THE MOBILE APPLICATION.

00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:35,100
AND THREE, I THINK WE HAVE
A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,936
IN THE MANAGEMENT TEAM
THAT YOU SEE BEFORE YOU,

00:35:37,936 --> 00:35:41,339
BECAUSE WE'RE BOTH EXPERTS
IN OUR RESPECTIVE FIELDS.
BRIAN, WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND?

00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:43,608
I WAS AT ERNST &amp; YOUNG,
DID ACCOUNTING

00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:45,610
AND COMPLIANCE AUDIT FOR THEM.
I THEN WENT ON

00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,446
TO DO INVESTMENT BANKING, UH,
MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS,

00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:50,448
CAPITAL MARKETS.
(Robert) WHAT ABOUT ADAM?

00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:52,884
I DID ERNST &amp; YOUNG,
INTERNAL AUDITOR.

00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:55,020
BUT THEN I SPENT EIGHT YEARS
AT CISCO SYSTEMS.

00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,689
I HAVE, UH, TWO C. C. I. E. s,
WHICH ARE ESSENTIALLY

00:35:57,689 --> 00:36:00,859
TWO PhDs IN THE INTERNET.
(O'Leary) WOW. VERY IMPRESSIVE.

00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:04,429
(Brian) THANK YOU.
BRIAN, LISTEN. I LIKE THE STORY.
I LIKE YOU GUYS.

00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:06,931
I LIKE THIS MARKET.
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.

00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:10,402
I'LL GIVE YOU $200,000 FOR 20%.

00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:16,608
WE'LL TAKE
THAT UNDER CONSIDERATION.
$300,000 FOR 35%.

00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:22,781
ROBERT...
I THINK YOU NEED‐‐
I THINK YOU NEED MORE CASH.

00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:25,183
YOU KNOW, ROBERT,
THERE'S A‐‐
(man speaks indistinctly)

00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,352
EXCUSE ME, GUYS.
WHY DON'T YOU TURN AROUND

00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:29,487
AND JUST EXIT
FOR A COUPLE MINUTES?

00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:34,092
I HAVE TO DISCUSS SOMETHING
WITH, UM, WITH ROBERT OVER HERE.
THANK YOU.

00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:37,562
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING‐‐
WE DON'T WANT TO DO

00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:39,564
WHAT WE'RE ABOUT TO DO
TO EACH OTHER.

00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:42,267
THIS IS GONNA GET
REALLY EXPENSIVE,

00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:44,769
SO LET'S STOP RIGHT NOW.
THINK ABOUT IT.
I‐‐

00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:48,373
IT'S A BIG MISTAKE
TO (bleep) ME ON THIS ONE.
ARE YOU‐‐
ARE YOU THREATENING ME?

00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:51,376
ARE YOU SAYING
YOU'RE GONNA GO UP?
NO, I'M JUST SAYING THERE'S
TWO WAYS THIS COULD GO‐‐

00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:54,512
WE CAN STOP RAISING THE PRICE
AND COLLUDE WITH EACH OTHER

00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:57,515
TO OUR ADVANTAGE, GIVE THEM
LESS CASH FOR MORE EQUITY‐‐

00:36:57,515 --> 00:37:00,585
WHICH IS REALLY WHAT'S ABOUT
TO HAPPEN IF YOU'RE SMART‐‐

00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:04,756
OR WE CAN COMPETE.
I THINK THEY'RE GONNA GO
WITH MY $300,000 FOR 35%.

00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:08,093
WHY NOT GO $400,000 FOR 50%?

00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:10,762
OOH, I LIKE THAT.
I LIKE 50%.

00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:14,432
50/50. AND WE‐‐
OH, THAT'S INTERESTING TO ME.
THAT'S <i>VERY</i> INTERESTING.

00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:17,635
LET'S BRING 'EM BACK. BRIAN?

00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:21,573
TWO OF US HAVE BEEN WHERE YOU
GUYS ARE BEFORE,

00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:24,542
NOT JUST ONCE, MULTIPLE TIMES.

00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:28,346
AND WE KNOW WHAT IT TAKES TO BE
SUCCESSFUL, AND THAT'S MONEY.

00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:33,785
WHATEVER YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA
NEED, YOU'RE GONNA NEED MORE.

00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:37,856
THE KEY TODAY IS TO HAVE
A BUFFER OF CASH.

00:37:37,856 --> 00:37:39,424
SO THE GOOD NEWS

00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:44,362
IS YOU CAME IN
LOOKING FOR $150,000.

00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:48,600
WE'RE GONNA OFFER YOU
$400,000.

00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,437
AND THERE'S MORE GOOD NEWS.
IT'S ONLY GOING TO BE 50%.

00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:57,509
I APPRECIATE THE OFFER,
BUT WHAT I'LL ASK YOU TO DO

00:37:57,509 --> 00:38:00,211
IS BACK OFF THE‐‐THE 50%,

00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:03,715
SO THAT WE HAVE MORE ROOM
TO MANAGE THE BUSINESS,

00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:06,050
TO ALLOCATE EQUITY
TO NEW AND FUTURE EMPLOYEES

00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,419
AND GO BACK
TO THE $200,000 OFFER.

00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:12,290
WOW. YOU GUYS ARE SAYING NO
TO THE EXTRA CASH?

00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:15,326
YES, SIR, WE ARE.

00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:18,763
I LOVE YOU EVEN MORE.

00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:22,066
BRIAN, ADAM, I'M SPEECHLESS.
I TOLD YOU THEY‐‐THEY WERE
SMARTER THAN ME,

00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:24,903
'CAUSE I'D HAVE GRABBED
THAT CASH AND RAN ALREADY.

00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:28,606
SO, BRIAN, WE OFFERED YOU
$400,000 FOR 50%,

00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:30,208
AND YOU'VE COUNTERED WITH...

00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:32,210
I'D LIKE TO GO BACK
TO THE $200,000 THAT YOU

00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:34,913
INITIALLY OFFERED, BUT I DIDN'T
STATE AN EQUITY AMOUNT.

00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:37,081
WHAT ARE YOU OFFERING ME?
$200,000 FOR WHAT PERCENTAGE?

00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:39,617
WELL, LET'S PULL OUT
A CALCULATOR AND FIND OUT,

00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:42,520
SO THAT WE DON'T...
HE GOT A CALCULATOR.
HE GOT A CALCULATOR ON HIM.

00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:47,392
YOU KNOW IT'S NEVER GOOD WHEN
YOU NEED A CALCULATOR, BRIAN.
(Brian) NO, SIR.

00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:49,060
16% OF THE BUSINESS.

00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,996
NO. TOO LOW. IT DOESN'T HAVE
THE GOOD FEELING TO IT.

00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:55,233
WHAT IT DOES IS, IT POSITIONS
YOU WITH THE MANAGEMENT TEAM

00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:57,569
IN A BUSINESS MODEL
THAT IS PROVEN.

00:38:57,569 --> 00:39:00,705
I STILL LIKE
THE $400,000 FOR 50%.

00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:02,707
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA NEED
MORE CASH.

00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:06,544
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE WILL BE
UNABLE TO RAISE CAPITAL

00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:08,079
IN 60 OR 90 DAYS.

00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,082

WE HAVE A GOOD STORY, AND IF I‐‐

AGAIN, I APPRECIATE THE OFFER‐‐
WAIT A SECOND.

00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:20,124
BEFORE YOU SAY NO TO THAT, THINK
ABOUT THAT. THINK ABOUT THAT.

00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:23,228
THIS ISN'T "MONOPOLY" MONEY.
YOU REALIZE THAT, BRIAN?

00:39:23,228 --> 00:39:25,530
IT'S‐‐IT'S PRETTY HARD
TO GET CASH.

00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,266
ROBERT, I REAL‐‐
I APPRECIATE YOUR OFFER,
