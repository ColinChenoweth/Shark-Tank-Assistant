00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:11,691
I WANT TO START WORKING ON
AN ELECTRIC VERSION OF THIS.

00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:14,126
OKAY?
HOW MANY DO YOU HAVE NOW?
HOW MANY MOPEDS?

00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:16,262
THIS IS IT.
JUST THE ONE?

00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,764
AND ARE YOU MAKING A LIVING?

00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:23,002
I'M‐‐I'M BARELY
EKING OUT A LIVING.
DO YOU THINK THAT'S A PROBLEM

00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:25,471
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO SELL IT
TO OTHER FRANCHISEES,

00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:29,075
AND YOU'RE BARELY MAKING
A LIVING?
I DON'T, BECAUSE I'M STILL
LEARNING THE BUSINESS.

00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:32,678
OKAY, YOU SAID YOU'RE GONNA
FRANCHISE THIS.

00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:35,314
HAVE YOU HIRED
ANY FRANCHISE LAWYERS?
(laughs)

00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:38,784
DO YOU HAVE DOCUMENTS PREPARED?
ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
KEVIN, HE'S MAKING $25
AN HOUR SELLING ICE CREAM.

00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,753
(Harrington) RIGHT.
RIGHT NOW I'M SELLING...

00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:43,389
A CONCEPT.
SEVERAL DIFFERENT BRANDS‐‐

00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:45,491
YOU'RE REALLY SELLING A CONCEPT
RIGHT NOW, AREN'T YOU?
EXACTLY. EXACTLY.

00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:47,793
YES. IF I BUY
A FRANCHISE FROM YOU,

00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,629
LET ME WALK IN THAT GUY'S SHOES.
OKAY.

00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,465
HOW MUCH COULD I REASONABLY
EXPECT TO EARN IF I WAS WORKING

00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,934
FOUR HOURS A DAY,
FIVE DAYS A WEEK?

00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:58,204
BECAUSE THAT'S THE NUMBER
YOU THREW OUT, FOUR HOURS‐‐
MORE THAN YOU'RE MAKING
IN REAL ESTATE TODAY.

00:18:58,204 --> 00:18:59,805
(Barbara) PROBABLY. (laughs)
(laughs)

00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,974
YOU COULD EASILY MAKE $25,000
TO $50,000 A YEAR

00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,643
AS AN ICE CREAM PERSON.

00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:06,379
I GET WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
YOU SELL ICE CREAM.

00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:09,548
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE
THE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY IS,

00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:12,752
BECAUSE ANYBODY CAN MAKE
A MOPED WITH A FREEZER ON IT.
YEAH, BUT CAN THEY?

00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:15,554
THAT'S THE THING.
CAN THEY? YOU KNOW‐‐
YEAH, THEY CAN.

00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,060
(Daymond)
TIM, I THINK IT'S A‐A CRIME

00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,562
FOR ME TO INSULT
AN ICE CREAM MAN.

00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,064
I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING

00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:27,433
JUST INNOCENT AND BEAUTIFUL
ABOUT AN ICE CREAM MAN.

00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:29,402
I CAN APPRECIATE THAT.
THANK YOU.

00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:31,404
BUT THE BUSINESS
IS NOT BIG ENOUGH FOR ME.

00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:33,839
BUT I DO LOVE YOUR, UH,
YOUR‐‐YOUR ATTITUDE

00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,841
AND WHAT YOU WANT TO DO,

00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:40,046
BUT I'M OUT.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT, BEC‐‐
ALL RIGHT, THINK ABOUT IT.

00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:43,049
OKAY, IT'S A VERY INEXPENSIVE
FRANCHISE‐‐
WELL, THINK ABOUT
MY POINT OF VIEW.

00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:47,119
ALL I CARE ABOUT IS,
HOW DO I GET MY MONEY BACK?
WELL, YOU GET YOUR MONEY BACK
IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS.

00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,156
HOW?
FIRST OF ALL,
SAY THE FRANCHISE IS $12,500

00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:52,324
TO BE A FRANCHISEE
OF CAPTAIN ICE CREAM.

00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,460
OKAY, SO‐‐
WHY WOULD ANYBODY GIVE YOU
$12,000 WHEN THEY COULD JUST‐‐

00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,463
WHY NOT? YOU'RE GONNA SELL THEM
ICE CREAM AT A DISCOUNT

00:19:57,463 --> 00:20:00,933
THAT'S GONNA BE
THEIR OWN BRANDED ICE CREAM.
BUT THEY COULD
BUY ICE CREAM <i>ANYWHERE.</i>

00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:04,637
LOOK, YOU'VE GOT A CONCEPT
OF WHICH NOTHING IS...

00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,772
UNIQUE AND PATENTABLE OR‐‐

00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:09,909
YOU DON'T THINK
THIS IS UNIQUE?
ADMIT IT. IT'S UNIQUE.

00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:13,112
AT LEAST GIVE THE GUY THAT.
IT'S ABSOLUTELY UNIQUE.

00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:15,114
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW
WHAT I'VE DECIDED?

00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:17,383
I'M GONNA GIVE‐‐
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU $48,000

00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,719
OF BARBARA'S MONEY.
(laughs)

00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,788
(laughs)
YOU KNOW,
I‐‐I'M HOLDING MYSELF BACK,

00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:25,691
BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN CHILDREN
AND WONDERFUL, WARM AND‐‐

00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:27,693
AND THINGS FROM THE PAST.

00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,795
THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING
TO RECREATE HERE.
BUT‐‐BUT I CAN'T MAKE
ANY MONEY.

00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:31,964
AND I WANT YOU
TO GET BACK ON THAT THING

00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:34,967
AND RIDE INTO THE SUNSET,
BECAUSE‐‐
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S TRUE, THOUGH,

00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,636
BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA TAKE
A FRANCHISE FEE...
NO, I REALLY DO BECAUSE,
I HAVE TO‐‐HERE'S THE PROBLEM‐‐

00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:40,940
AND YOU'RE GONNA MAKE A PROFIT
ON EVERY BIKE.
HERE'S THE BUSINESS REALITY
IN THIS.

00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,310
OKAY.
IN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO SEND YOU AN INVOICE

00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,312
FOR ABOUT $2,000 FOR MY TIME.
(laughs)

00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:50,049
I GONNA TAKE OFF 50 CENTS
FOR THE ICE CREAM, THOUGH.
OKAY. IT'S $1.50, BY THE WAY.

00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:53,219
$1.50? THAT'S AN OUTRAGE.
ARE YOU KIDDING?
IT'S A 400% MARKUP
ON ICE CREAM.

00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:56,589
THERE'S JUST NOTHING HERE.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
(Daymond) SAY THE WORD.

00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,090
I'M OUT.

00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,993
I WANT TO SUMMARIZE
WHAT YOU'VE TOLD ME,

00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,995
JUST SO I'M CLEAR.
OKAY, SURE.

00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:05,231
YOU BARELY MAKE ANY MONEY
DOING THIS TODAY.

00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:09,068
YOU DON'T MAKE THE ICE CREAM.
NOT YET.
I'M WORKING ON IT.

00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:11,871
YOU HAVEN'T SOLD
A SINGLE FRANCHISE.

00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:14,240
AND YOU HAVE
A LONG WAY TO GO.

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,476
IT'S A START‐UP.
WHAT AM I GONNA TELL YOU?

00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:20,246
UM, THE ICE CREAM GAVE ME
A BRAIN FREEZE. I'M OUT.

00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:25,751
TIM, I UNDERSTAND WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO,

00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,920
BUT YOU HAVE
NO FRANCHISE COMPANY, OKAY?

00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,490
IT'S A SMALL BUSINESS.
THANK YOU FOR‐‐FOR COMING HERE
TODAY, BUT I'M OUT.

00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:36,228
I THINK I'D HAPPILY BUY
ICE CREAM FROM YOU.

00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:38,898
YOU SEEM LIKE THE PERFECT
ICE CREAM KIND OF GUY.

00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:41,834
BUT YOU'RE HERE TOO EARLY,
YOU'RE HERE TOO UNPREPARED.

00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:44,003
I'M OUT.

00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:45,704
THANK YOU, TIM.

00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:48,707
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, ALL.
I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
(Robert) ALL RIGHT.

00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,209
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.

00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:01,854
I DON'T THINK THE SHARKS
SAW THE BEAUTY IN...

00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:03,956
WHAT THIS BUSINESS COULD BE.

00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:06,125
I‐‐I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED.

00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,395
(laughs)

00:22:09,395 --> 00:22:12,264
HE'S GOT A LOT
OF ICE CREAM IN HERE.

00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:15,534
OKAY, GET OUT OF THE WAY.
I'M GONNA START IT.
KICK IT.
KICK IT UP, BABY.

00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:18,537
BOYS WILL BOYS.
(laughing)

00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:21,240
I'M LEAVING. (laughs)

HELLO.
MY NAME IS MICHAEL SCHIAVONE.

I CALL MY IDEA CAFFEINDICATOR.

00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:07,920
AND I'M SEEKING $200,000

00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:12,491
IN EXCHANGE FOR A 25%
EQUITY POSITION IN THIS VENTURE.

00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:15,361
NOW DID YOU EVER WONDER WHY
THERE'S A DECAF MARKET?

00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:18,030
IT'S EITHER BECAUSE PEOPLE
DON'T WANT CAFFEINE

00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:21,634
OR CAN'T HAVE CAFFEINE FOR
MEDICAL OR FOR PERSONAL REASONS.

00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:23,102
THE FACT IS,

00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:26,438
YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER THERE'S
CAFFEINE IN YOUR COFFEE OR NOT.

00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:28,440
ENTER CAFFEINDICATOR.

00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,643
IT'S THE FIRST
LITMUS‐LIKE TESTER

00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:32,645
INCORPORATED
ON A SWEETENER PACKET

00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:35,147
WHICH CHANGES COLOR
IN THE PRESENCE OF CAFFEINE.

00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:38,250
IS IT INK IN THE PAPER
OR IN THE SUGAR?
IT'S ON THE PAPER.
IT'S AN INK.

00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,520
IT'S MICROENCAPSULATED
IN GELATIN.
(Robert) BUT, MICHAEL,
DOES IT REALLY WORK?

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,756
OH, CERTAINLY IT DOES WORK.
ABSOLUTELY.

00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:47,459
LET ME DEMONSTRATE
A MOCK PROTOTYPE.

00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:51,196
AS YOU CAN SEE, IF THERE'S
CAFFEINE IN THE COFFEE,

00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,966
IT WILL TURN PINK.

00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:57,102
IT'S DYNAMIC. IT'S CURIOUS.

00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,671
IT'S FUN TO SHARE.

00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:01,674
AND HEY, I DON'T EVEN USE
A SWEETENER IN MY COFFEE,

00:24:01,674 --> 00:24:03,776
BUT I JUST USED A PACKET.

00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:07,813
THE SWEETENER PACKET MARKET IS
ROUGHLY A $12‐BILLION MARKET,

00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:10,015
OF WHICH, THE BLUE GUYS
HAVE MARKET SHARE,

00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:12,117
THE PINK GUYS
HAVE MARKET SHARE,

00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,953
THE GREEN GUYS
HAVE MARKET SHARE,

00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,821
THE YELLOW GUYS
HAVE MARKET SHARE,

00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:18,457
AND THE WHITE GUYS
HAVE MARKET SHARE.

00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:21,460
NOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF
ANY ONE OF THESE MANUFACTURERS

00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,462
WERE ABLE TO DRAMATICALLY
INCREASE THEIR SHARE

00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,831
IN THIS GLOBAL MARKET?

00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:28,200
DOES THAT HAVE VALUE?
YES.

00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,668
OF COURSE IT DOES.

00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:31,670
SHARKS, WELCOME TO
THE SUGAR BOWL BRAWL.

00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:35,107
THESE GUYS ARE ALL FIGHTING
FOR MARKET SHARE.

00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:38,110
SO WHAT DOES IT TAKE
TO TAKE A $500‐MILLION PRODUCT

00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:42,448
TO A $1‐BILLION PRODUCT?

00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:45,484
BUT IS THERE AN INDICATION
OF IT HEAVILY CAFFEINATED

00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,553
OR WHATEVER THE CASE IS?

00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:49,555
NO, IT DOESN'T TELL ME
HOW MUCH CAFFEINE.

00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:52,224
IT TELLS ME WHETHER OR NOT
THERE IS CAFFEINE.
ALMOST LIKE A PREGNANCY TEST‐‐

00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:55,227
VERY SIMILAR. IN FACT,
THAT WAS PART OF THE‐‐

00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:58,230
BUT DOESN'T‐‐DOESN'T DECAF‐‐
HAS ABOUT 2 MILLIGRAMS
OF CAFFEINE IN IT.

00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,633
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT,
VERSUS 120 MILLIGRAMS.
BUT IT'S STILL
GONNA TRIGGER THE TEST.

00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:05,104
I CAN MASK OUT
THE FALSE POSITIVES.
(Robert) YOU'RE MISSING
THE POINT OF THIS.

00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:08,107
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER
THE PERSON WANTS TO KNOW

00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:10,009
WHETHER THERE'S CAFFEINE OR NOT.

00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:12,311
IT'S THE FACT THAT THE WHITE GUY
CAN SAY TO THE YELLOW GUY,

00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:14,980
"MY PACKET'S BETTER
BECAUSE IT DOES THIS."
I GET IT. I GET THAT.

00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,782
(O'Leary) AND I AGREE WITH YOU.
THAT'S IT!

00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:19,752
(Michael) THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.

00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:21,754
THE MANUFACTURING
AND THE DISTRIBUTION

00:25:21,754 --> 00:25:24,757
IS ALREADY IN PLACE.

00:25:24,757 --> 00:25:27,760
WHAT WE'RE LEVERAGING IS MARKET
SHARE IN A GLOBAL INDUSTRY.

00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,895
AND I'D LIKE TO KNOW
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED

00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:32,197
IN PARTNERING WITH ME
ON THIS VENTURE.

00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,633
SO, MICHAEL, WHEN YOU WENT
TO THE BLUE GUYS,

00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:36,802
AND SAID,
"I HAVE THIS GREAT IDEA,

00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:40,672
BUY MY PRODUCT,"
WHAT DID THEY SAY?

00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:42,775
I HAVE NOT GONE
TO THE BLUE GUYS YET.
WHY NOT?

00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:45,377
I CAME TO YOU GUYS TO SEE
IF YOU CAN OPEN THE DOORS

00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,379
AND PARTNER WITH ME IN‐‐
ON THIS.

00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,049
YOU'VE NEVER TRIED TO TALK TO
ANY OF THE WHITE, YELLOW,

00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:52,151
GREEN, PINK, BLUE GUYS?
NO, SIR. I HAVE NOT.

00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:54,653
AND DO YOU OWN THE PATENT‐‐
I DO.

00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:58,690
HOW MUCH WILL THIS ADD
TO THE COST OF EACH PACKET?

00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:01,093
IT HAS TO BE NEGLIGIBLE.
(Robert) YOU DON'T KNOW
THE NUMBER?

00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:03,462
UH, UH, NO. THE FACT
OF THE MATTER

00:26:03,462 --> 00:26:05,464
IS THAT ANYTHING YOU MAKE
IN MASS QUANTITY,

00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:08,434
THE‐‐THE‐‐THE‐‐THE PRICE
OF IT DROPS.

00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:11,570
WHAT'S YOUR COST
TO MAKE ONE PACK NOW?
I DON'T HAVE A COST TO MAKE
ONE PACK RIGHT NOW.

00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,973
WHAT‐‐GIVE US A NUMBER. WE JUST
WANT A FEEL FOR THE NUMBER.
(Robert) VOLUME‐‐YEAH.

00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:17,042
HERE'S MY THOUGHT ON THAT.

00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:19,044
UM, IF I INCREASE
MARKET SHARE DRAMATICALLY,

00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:21,880
THE COST OF PRODUCTION
GOES DOWN, PROFIT GOES UP.
(Barbara) YES.

00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,850
GIVE US A NUMBER.
YEAH, WE‐‐WE GET THAT,
BUT CAN IT BE MADE

00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:28,153
FOR A FRACTION OF PENNIES MORE?

00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:30,022
ABSOLUTELY.
IT CAN?

00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:32,558
ABSOLUTELY.
SO, MICHAEL,
WHAT YOU'VE DONE, BASICALLY,

00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:35,294
IS YOU DEFINED
YOUR ENTIRE MARKET.

00:26:35,294 --> 00:26:39,431
THAT'S GOOD. IT'S VERY CLEAR
WHO WE HAVE TO SELL IT TO.

00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,868
THE BAD IS, IT'S VERY CLEAR
WHO WE HAVE TO SELL IT TO.

00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:47,406
IF ONE OF THESE COLOR
DON'T BUY YOUR PRODUCT,

00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:49,842
THERE IS NO MARKET.
WOULD YOU AGREE?

00:26:49,842 --> 00:26:51,844
THAT'S CORRECT.

00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:55,447
BUT WAIT A MINUTE. YOUR STRATEGY
IS TO GO TO ALL FIVE AND SAY,

00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,450
"WHICH ONE OF YOU WANTS TO
INCREASE YOUR MARKET SHARE?"

00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,286
SO THE REAL QUESTION
ON YOUR DEAL IS,

00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,755
IF I'M ONE OF THESE
MARKETEER MANUFACTURERS,

00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:05,757
I HAVE TO BUY INTO YOUR PREMISE

00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:08,193
THAT PUTTING AN INDICATOR
FOR CAFFEINE

00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:10,195
IS GOING TO
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE

00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,364
THE NUMBER OF TIMES
PEOPLE USE MY PACKET.

00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:14,366
I THINK THAT'S A GIVEN.
ABSOLUTELY.

00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:16,835
HOWEVER,
THERE'S ANOTHER ANGLE.

00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:19,171
WHAT IS IT?

00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:22,941
WHAT IF I DON'T WANT MY‐‐
MY COMPETITION TO HAVE THIS?

00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:24,576
AND THEY BURY IT.

00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:28,780
YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOMETHING
NASTY ABOUT YOU I REALLY LIKE.

00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:32,017
(Robert laughs)
OH. (chuckles) I'M... I THINK
I'M HAPPY TO HEAR THAT.

00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,519
NO, NO, I LIKE IT.

00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:35,921
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO
IS CREATE A BIDDING WAR

00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:38,357
IN A VERY,
VERY STRUCTURED MARKET.
AND SPEAKING PLAINLY,

00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:40,826
THERE'S THE FEEDING FRENZY.
RIGHT.

00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,828
WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING?

00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:45,097
CURRENTLY, I'M A MECHANICAL
ENGINEER. I'M IN BETWEEN.

00:27:45,097 --> 00:27:47,099
AND SOME DAY‐TRADING
IN THE MARKET.

00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:49,301
AND WHERE DID YOU GET
THIS IDEA FROM?

00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:51,436
I WAS ON A BUSINESS TRIP
AND, 11:00 AT NIGHT,

00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,438
I STOPPED WITH MY WIFE
AND SAID,

00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:55,874
"LET'S HAVE A SLICE OF PIE
AND CUP OF COFFEE."

00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:58,944
I HAD A BUSINESS MEETING
THE NEXT DAY.

00:27:58,944 --> 00:28:02,681
I WAS UP ALL NIGHT, AND I <i>KNOW</i>
SHE DIDN'T GIVE ME DECAF.

00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:06,018
BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO
TELL, AND THAT'S TO DRINK IT.
SO WHAT'S WITH THE $200,000?

00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:09,655
IT'S JUST A NUMBER
YOU PULLED OUT OF THE AIR?
THERE IS, UM, UH,
LICENSING FEES,

00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:11,657
THERE'S ATTORNEY FEES,
AS YOU KNOW,

00:28:11,657 --> 00:28:13,659
AND WE HAVE TO
SET UP A CORPORATION.

00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:16,395
AND I NEED SOME HELP. I NEED
YOU GUYS TO OPEN UP DOORS.

00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:19,898
IF ONE OF YOU ARE INTERESTED,
I WANT TO ADVANCE THIS.

00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:22,534
I WANT TO MOVE IT FORWARD.
(Barbara) I'M GONNA JUMP IN‐‐

00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,102
I'LL‐‐
IN HERE,

00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:27,206
BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE TWO
REAL WEAKNESSES TO THIS IDEA.

00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:30,042
I'M NOT SURE THE CONSUMER
IS THAT PARANOID

00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,044
ABOUT TESTING AND MISTRUSTING
WHETHER THEY GOT

00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:34,413
CAFFEINATED COFFEE
OR DECAFFEINATED COFFEE‐‐

00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:36,915
THAT'S ONE‐‐
AND THE SECOND REASON IS,

00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:39,151
WITH ANY OF THESE
PROSPECTIVE BUYERS

00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:41,153
YOU'RE HOPING TO SELL TO,

00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:44,156
IT'S NOT JUST THE MINIMAL COST
OF ADDING IT TO THE PACKET.

00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:46,158
BUT THEY'VE GOT TO MARKET
THE IDEA

00:28:46,158 --> 00:28:48,994
AND LET THE CONSUMER KNOW,
AND THAT'S EXPENSIVE.

00:28:48,994 --> 00:28:52,064
IT'S NOT SUCH AN EASY,
CLEAR ROAD TO MY MIND

00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,565
AS YOU'RE POSITIONING IT.

00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:57,603
SO FOR THOSE TWO REASONS ONLY,
I'M OUT.

00:28:57,603 --> 00:29:00,205
THOSE ARE EXCELLENT POINTS,
BARBARA.

00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,541
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY
MICHAEL REALIZES,

00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:04,676
HIS 25% IS LUDICROUS.

00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:08,647
(O'Leary) THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A NEGOTIATION, ROBERT.

00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:11,917
THAT'S LIKE BASICALLY SAYING
THAT YOU'LL DO THIS DEAL,

00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:14,987
BUT YOU WANT MORE THAN 25%,
AND YOUR GREED IS SHOWING.

00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:18,156
THAT SHOULD BE
FAMILIAR TO YOU.
I SAW YOUR GREED.
I SAW YOUR GREED.

00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:21,226
YOU KNOW, MIKE, I WAS
ON THE FENCE FOR A SECOND,

00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:24,062
BUT I AGREE WITH BARBARA
THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO DO

00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:26,064
VERY POINTED
AND SPECIFIC MARKETING.

00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:28,400
I LIKE THE IDEA
THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ATTACK

00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,902

SOLD IN THE WORLD.

00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:33,171

FROM LOYOLA LAW SCHOOL

00:32:38,657 --> 00:32:41,059

SO, JEFF AND ANNIE,
JUST SO I'M VERY CLEAR...

00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:57,996
OKAY.

00:34:57,996 --> 00:35:01,066
YOU'VE COMBINED A COFFEE SHOP
WITH LEGAL SERVICES.

00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:03,034
YES, TO SERVE
THE MIDDLE CLASS, BECAUSE‐‐

00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:06,037

THE MIDDLE CLASS IS...

00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:08,640
NOT GETTING
THEIR LEGAL SERVICES MET.

00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,643
I GET THE IDEA.
I LIKE THE TARGET MARKET.
OKAY.

00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:14,646
BUT YOU'RE LOSING ME ON THE FACT
THAT TO GET INTO YOUR BUSINESS,

00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:17,882
I HAVE TO GO INTO
THE RETAIL COFFEE BUSINESS.
NO, YOU DON'T.

00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:21,653
ACTUALLY,
IT'S A COFFEEHOUSE SETTING.
IT'S JUST A PLACE TO START,
BECAUSE ALL OF OUR LAWYERS

00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:24,289
HAVE THEIR OWN OFFICES
AND EVERYTHING.

00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,858
SO IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU WOULD BE COMING THERE

00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:29,260
FOR ALL YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH THAT LAWYER.

00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,763
CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME
WHY YOU WANT TO BE

00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:33,765
IN THE LOW‐MARGIN
LEGAL SERVICES BUSINESS

00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:35,767
AND COFFEE HAS ANYTHING
TO DO WITH IT?

00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:40,605
WELL, I‐I DON'T THINK
IT MIGHT BE LOW MARGIN. UH‐‐
I'M LOOKING AT THESE PRICES.

00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:43,108
I CAN'T GET FIVE MINUTES
OF MY LAWYER'S TIME

00:35:43,108 --> 00:35:47,345
FOR ANY OF THOSE NUMBERS.
BUT THE DOCUMENT SERVICES
ARE NOT PERFORMED BY A LAWYER...

00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:49,914
YOU DON'T‐‐ARE NOT HIRING
A LAWYER.

00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:52,117
THEY'RE HAVING DOCUMENTS
PREPARED,

00:35:52,117 --> 00:35:53,885
BECAUSE MAYBE, YOU KNOW,
AND THEN THIS ALSO

00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:57,155
HELPS US, TOO, WITH UPSELLING.
OKAY, ANNIE,
WALK ME THROUGH ONE.

00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:00,025
I'LL TAKE HEALTH CARE DIRECTIVE
FOR $100.

00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:01,793
OKAY.

00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:03,795
HOW MUCH OF YOUR TIME
DOES IT TAKE

00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:06,798

I CAN PREPARE ONE
IN TEN MINUTES.

00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:09,434

YOU'RE TELLING ME

WHICH YOU SOLD FOR $2.50‐‐
I CAN INTERVIEW THEM AND HAVE
THEM PREPARED IN TEN MINUTES.

00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:16,007

DONE THAT BEFORE?

00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,876

STORE FOR SEVEN YEARS.

LOTS MORE JEFF AND ANNIES

00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,884

NO, WE DON'T.

FRANCHISING THEM, RIGHT?

THE RIGHT PERSON.

BUT, JEFF,
YOU'RE AN ACCREDITED LAWYER.

00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:35,226

ABOUT HAVING COFFEE WAITRESSES

00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:37,095
PROVIDING LEGAL SERVICES?

00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:40,932
(laughs)
NO, AS LONG AS SHE'S NOT
PROVIDING LEGAL ADVICE.

00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:42,867
SHE'S A DOCUMENT ASSISTANT.

00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,836
ISN'T THIS MUCH BETTER DONE
ON THE INTERNET

00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:48,173
WHERE THERE'S NO
BRICK‐AND‐MORTAR COST INVOLVED?
WHY THE COFFEE SHOP?

00:36:48,173 --> 00:36:50,875
PEOPLE LIKE TO ACTUALLY
TALK TO A...
THEY DO. I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW MANY TIMES...

00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,878
A WARM‐BLOODED HUMAN BEING.
I'VE HAD SOMEBODY COME IN THAT
DID SERVICES OVER THE INTERNET,

00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,380
AND THEY WERE NOT HAPPY.

00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,016
WHEN IT COMES TO
CERTAIN LEGAL SERVICES,

00:36:58,016 --> 00:37:00,385
THEY WANT TO INTERACT.
ANNIE, CRAZY IDEA.

00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:03,822
JUST OPEN UP A STORE
THAT SAYS "LEGAL SERVICES."

00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:05,423
RIGHT.

00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:08,326
NOBODY WOULD COME IN 'CAUSE
THEY DON'T TRUST LAWYERS.
(laughs)

00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:10,662
THERE'S TRUTH IN THAT.
WHAT IF YOU'RE JUST SITTING
IN A COFFEE SHOP

00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:13,231
TALKING TO A LAWYER?
IT'S BRINGING
SOMEBODY TOGETHER‐‐

00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,200
PEOPLE GO
TO OTHER PLACES AND SIT

00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,168
AND MEET WITH THEIR LAWYER.
(O'Leary) ALL RIGHT.

00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:19,170
THE COFFEE HAS TO DO WITH

00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,306
JUST MAKING SOMEBODY
FEEL COMFORTABLE...
YES.

00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:23,842
ADDRESSING THEIR DIFFICULT
LEGAL ISSUES.
BUT WHY IS IT‐‐
WHY IS IT COFFEE AND LAWYERS?

00:37:23,842 --> 00:37:25,844
WHY ISN'T IT PIZZA AND LAWYERS?

00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:29,147
WHY ISN'T IT
DRY CLEANER AND LAWYERS?
WHERE'S THE DIGNITY
IN PIZZA AND LAWYERS?

00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:33,318
WHAT, THERE'S DIGNITY IN COFFEE?
CAN I SHOW YOU A LIST

00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:37,122
OF FRANCHISEE REQUESTS
THAT WE'VE RECEIVED?
YOU HAVE A LIST
OF FRANCHISEE REQUESTS?

00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:40,391
OH, OVER A HUNDRED.
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST
TAKE DOWN PAYMENTS

00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:42,026
ON THE FRANCHISEE REQUESTS?

00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:44,896
THEN ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS TAKE 20 FRANCHISEE REQUESTS

00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:47,098
WORTH $10,000 APIECE.
RIGHT.

00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,968
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT EVEN
IN THE POSITION TO KNOW

00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:52,971
HOW OR WHAT TO DO
WHEN WE GET THESE REQUESTS.
YEAH, BUT THEN
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO

00:37:52,971 --> 00:37:54,806
ONCE WE GIVE YOU THE $200,000?

00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:56,975
YOU'RE STILL NOT GONNA KNOW.
WELL, YOU HIRE‐‐

00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:59,344

00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:01,346

FR‐FRANCHISE CONSULTANTS.

TO THE COFFEE SHOP.

00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:09,087
DO YOU SEE THE IRONY?
DO YOU SEE THE IRONY THERE?
YOU'RE GONNA
JUMP OVER THE COUNTER

00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:12,090
AND SIT WITH A LAWYER.
LET'S SAY I SAY, "LOOK,
I WANT TO BE IN THE COFFEE

00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,591
AND LEGAL SERVICES BUSINESS."

00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:15,260
THEN I'D ASK THIS QUESTION‐‐

00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:18,830
HOW MUCH MONEY DOES
YOUR COFFEE/LEGAL STORE MAKE?

00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:21,933
AND THAT ANSWER IS ZERO.
NO. IT MAKES MONEY.

00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:23,668
NO, IT DOESN'T.
YES, IT DOES.

00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:25,804
AFTER YOU PAY YOURSELVES
A NORMAL SALARY,

00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:28,840
THERE'S NOTHING TO MAKE.
ANNIE, YOU'VE GOTTA WAKE UP

00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,075
AND SMELL THE MONEY.
THERE ISN'T ANY.

00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:34,145
HOW AM I GONNA PAY A FRANCHISE
FEE TO YOU IF I'M NOT PROFITING?
WELL, OKAY.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO

00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:37,949
IS PUT A LITTLE BIT
OF MONEY IN MARKETING.
JEFF, ANSWER THIS FOR ME.

00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:40,485
LET'S SAY I TAKE MY HARD‐EARNED
200,000 BUCKS

00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,487
AND HAND IT TO YOU TODAY.

00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:45,123
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH THAT MONEY?
WELL, I THINK, BARBARA,

00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:47,258
YOU AND I
WOULD HAVE TO DISCUSS IT.

00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:49,260
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE A PLAN

00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:53,565
AS TO HOW YOU'RE GOING
TO MAKE USE OF THAT MONEY?

00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:56,100
WE TAKE $115,000

00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,170
AND OPEN UP
A PROTOTYPE STORE.

00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,140
THAT STORE SHOULD BE MAKING
$300,000.

00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,542
AND FIND ANOTHER
LITTLE ANNIE THERE

00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:07,545

TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH EVERYBODY.

BE THERE THE WHOLE TIME.
