OR A RETAILER WHO IS GUARANTEED
TO PUT IT OUT.

00:07:39,615 --> 00:07:41,617
WITH YOUR MONEY, DAYMOND,
I COULD GO

00:07:41,617 --> 00:07:44,620

00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:44,339
ALL THE SHAKESPEAREAN CLASSICS
MUSICALLY?

00:33:44,339 --> 00:33:46,641
I WROTE AND PERFORMED
ALL THE SONGS ON THE ALBUM.

00:33:46,641 --> 00:33:49,811
WOW. SO YOU'RE SELLING US
THE ENTIRE RECORD LABEL?

00:33:49,811 --> 00:33:52,580
THAT'S PART OF THE BUSINESS?
YES, EXACTLY.

00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,083
AND THE RIGHTS TO THE SONGS?

00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:57,685
UM, I AM NOT SELLING
THE RIGHTS TO THE SONGS.

00:33:57,685 --> 00:33:59,587
OOH.

00:33:59,587 --> 00:34:01,656
I AM SELLING A STAKE
IN THE RECORD LABEL

00:34:01,656 --> 00:34:03,324
AND THE PUBLISHING HOUSE.

00:34:03,324 --> 00:34:05,126
BUT WHY NOT THE SONG?

00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:08,062
THE SONG IS SOMETHING THAT
I WOULD LIKE TO KEEP CONTROL OF.

00:34:08,062 --> 00:34:10,465
YOU ARE A NASTY MAN.

00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,533
SCHOOL IS YOUR CUSTOMER,
CORRECT?
CORRECT.

00:34:12,533 --> 00:34:15,303
WHAT'S THE COST TO THE SCHOOL?

00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:18,072
A CLASS SET COSTS, UH, $499,

00:34:18,072 --> 00:34:21,776
AND IT INCLUDES 30 CDs
AND THE TEACHER'S GUIDE.

00:34:21,776 --> 00:34:24,045
WHY--WHY SHAKESPEARE?
ANY OTHER PROGRAMS, LIKE WHY--

00:34:24,045 --> 00:34:25,546
YOU'RE SEEING AHEAD.
PRECISELY.

00:34:25,546 --> 00:34:27,916
THE REASON I CHOSE SHAKESPEARE
WAS BECAUSE, UH,

00:34:27,916 --> 00:34:30,919
HE IS THE MOST WIDELY TAUGHT
WRITER IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.

00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:34,689
HE'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE HARDEST
TO UNDERSTAND, TOO.
PRECISELY, UM,
AND ONE OF THE THINGS

00:34:34,689 --> 00:34:36,691
THAT KIDS REALLY
STRUGGLE WITH THE MOST.

00:34:36,691 --> 00:34:39,427
SO ANY OTHER ONES? ARE YOU
DOING ANY OTHER--

00:34:39,427 --> 00:34:41,429
UH, THE NEXT THREE, UH,
WE'RE PLANNING ON

00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:43,932
WILL TARGET DIFFERENT,
UH, DIFFERENT SUBJECTS--

00:34:43,932 --> 00:34:46,901
HISTORY, SCIENCE--
MARC, I'D LIKE YOU
TO DO ME A FAVOR.

00:34:46,901 --> 00:34:50,571
I'D LIKE YOU TO WALK OUTDOORS
FOR A MINUTE. LEAVE US ALONE.

00:34:50,571 --> 00:34:52,573
OKAY.

00:34:55,576 --> 00:34:57,578
(O'Leary) I-I LIKE THIS DEAL.

00:34:57,578 --> 00:34:59,948
THIS IS WHY I WANTED
TO CALL A SESSION TOGETHER.

00:34:59,948 --> 00:35:01,950
LET'S NOT
BID AGAINST EACH OTHER.

00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:04,852
FIRST OF ALL, THERE'S NO WAY ON
EARTH HE'S WALKING OUT OF HERE

00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,821
WITHOUT THE PUBLISHING RIGHTS
IN THE DEAL.

00:35:06,821 --> 00:35:09,090
$250,000 FOR 100%
OF THE BUSINESS,

00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:12,660
AND HE GETS A 5% ROYALTY
AFTER WE RECOUP OUR DOUGH.

00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:15,763
I LOVE IT, BUT I MEAN,
I'D LOVE TO BE TALLER, TOO.

00:35:15,763 --> 00:35:19,167
I JUST DON'T THINK
HE'S GONNA DO IT.
I'M NOT GIVING HIM ANY DOUGH
UNLESS I HAVE TOTAL CONTROL

00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:22,036
AND I OWN ALL THE RIGHTS.
THAT'S IT.
MEAN GUY.

00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:24,038
BUT A ROYALTY STREAM FOR HIM

00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:26,541
CAN BE WORTH MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
OVER THE--OVER TIME,

00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,577
SO THIS IS STILL A VERY--
A VERY GOOD OFFER.
CALL HIM BACK IN.

00:35:29,577 --> 00:35:32,880
MARC, COME ON DOWN.

00:35:35,783 --> 00:35:38,586
(O'Leary) YOU KNOW,
I'VE GOTTA TELL YOU SOMETHING.

00:35:38,586 --> 00:35:41,289
YOU'RE A VERY LUCKY GUY TODAY,
THAT WE MET.

00:35:41,289 --> 00:35:43,925
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU RICH,
I THINK.

00:35:43,925 --> 00:35:46,794
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
REALLY THINK THIS THROUGH.

00:35:46,794 --> 00:35:49,230
WE FORM A NEW COMPANY.
WE OWN IT.

00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,666
WE FUND IT WITH $250,000.

00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:53,634
IT'S A PUBLISHING COMPANY
FOR YOU.

00:35:53,634 --> 00:35:56,871
JUST LIKE A GREAT ARTIST,
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE A ROYALTY--

00:35:56,871 --> 00:35:59,607
IN PERPETUITY,
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE, 5%.

00:35:59,607 --> 00:36:02,877
THE FIVE SHARKS
HAVE OFFERED MARC

00:36:09,684 --> 00:36:12,086
UM...

00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,588
FASCINATING.

00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,923
I--IT'S A--IT'S A GREAT--

00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:20,461
IT'S GREAT TO IMAGINE THAT THE--
YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO DO THAT.

00:36:20,461 --> 00:36:22,497
UM, BUT...

00:36:22,497 --> 00:36:24,766
I'D LIKE
TO BUILD THIS COMPANY--

00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:28,736
STOP RIGHT THERE.
DO YOU WANT TO BE RICH OR NOT?

00:36:28,736 --> 00:36:30,738
I DO WANT TO BE RICH.

00:36:30,738 --> 00:36:33,441
WELL, LET'S GET FOCUSED
ON THAT, BUDDY.

00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:36,344
BUT DO YOU WANT TO HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THE EVERYDAY ASPECTS

00:36:36,344 --> 00:36:37,845
OF SALES, DISTRIBUTION,
MANUFACTURING?

00:36:37,845 --> 00:36:40,748
OR DO YOU WANT TO BE ABLE
TO DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU DO,

00:36:40,748 --> 00:36:43,418
AN ARTIST AND A TEACHER?
THIS--THE LATTER SOUNDS IDEAL,

00:36:43,418 --> 00:36:46,387
ALTHOUGH, I MUST SAY,
SINCE I STARTED TO THINK ABOUT,

00:36:46,387 --> 00:36:48,956
UH, STARTING A BUSINESS,
THE MARKETING, THE SALES,

00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:52,527
UH, THE NETWORKING
IS ALSO VERY EXCITING.

00:36:52,527 --> 00:36:54,829
IT WON'T BE AFTER A WHILE.

00:36:54,829 --> 00:36:57,832
HOW MANY TIMES IN YOUR LIFE
HAVE FIVE PEOPLE SAID,

00:36:57,832 --> 00:37:01,135
"LET ME GIVE YOU $250,000
TO START A COMPANY,

00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:04,705
"OF WHICH YOU, FOR THE REST
OF THE DAYS YOUR ALIVE,

00:37:04,705 --> 00:37:06,207
"MAKE A ROYALTY,

00:37:06,207 --> 00:37:09,210
REGARDLESS OF HOW HARD
IT IS FOR US TO SELL IT"?

00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:12,713
I GUESS WHAT I'M CONCERNED
WITH IS, 5% FEELS QUITE SMALL.

00:37:12,713 --> 00:37:15,750
IN PERPETUITY? FOREVER?

00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:18,052
THE MODEL OF ROYALTIES
IS A GREAT DEAL FOR YOU.
YES.

00:37:18,052 --> 00:37:20,955
WHY AREN'T YOU JUMPING
ALL OVER THIS?

00:37:20,955 --> 00:37:23,458
I SENSE THAT YOU'RE CONCERNED.

00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:25,927
WELL, THERE IS THE--THE QUESTION
OF THE EQUITY STAKE.

00:37:25,927 --> 00:37:28,529
I LIKE THE IDEA OF MAINTAINING
EQUITY IN SOMETHING--

00:37:28,529 --> 00:37:31,199
BUT THAT'S NOT THE OFFER
ON THE TABLE, MY FRIEND.

00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:34,168
THE OFFER ON THE TABLE RIGHT NOW
IS TO SET UP A NEW COMPANY...

00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:36,571
MM-HMM.
THAT THE SHARKS OWN,

00:37:36,571 --> 00:37:39,407
AND YOU GET,
WHICH IS A GREAT DEAL,

00:37:39,407 --> 00:37:41,375
A PERCENTAGE OF THOSE SALES

00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:43,377
FOR SIMPLY CREATING MATERIAL.

00:37:43,377 --> 00:37:46,547
UM, I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE
A COUNTEROFFER.

00:37:46,547 --> 00:37:49,450
WE'RE ALL EARS.

00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:52,386
I WOULD LIKE TO BE, UH,
SIX PLAYERS

00:37:52,386 --> 00:37:55,556
AS CO-OWNERS OF THE COMPANY.
IT'S UN-AMERICAN,
WHAT YOU'RE ASKING.

00:37:55,556 --> 00:37:58,192
YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE
ANY RISK.

00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,761
YOU WANT US TO SPEND
ALL OF OUR DOLLARS,

00:38:00,761 --> 00:38:03,197
GIVE YOU FREE EQUITY
AND GET A ROYALTY.

00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:05,833
DO YOU SEE THE PROBLEM
WITH THAT?
I-I DON'T SEE IT AS FREE--

00:38:05,833 --> 00:38:08,836
AND LOOK AT HOW WE'RE STRUGGLING
TO MAKE IT WORK FOR YOU.
I-I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH.

00:38:08,836 --> 00:38:11,305
UM, I DON'T SEE IT
AS FREE EQUITY.
DON'T TRY TO BE A SHARK.

00:38:11,305 --> 00:38:14,308
YOU--YOU EITHER GET EQUITY
OR YOU DO A ROYALTY DEAL.

00:38:14,308 --> 00:38:16,310
I HEAR YOU SAYING
"I LOVE MY BUSINESS."

00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,813
YOU HAVE A PASSION FOR IT.

00:38:18,813 --> 00:38:22,750
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $250,000.
I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU ON MY OWN.

00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:25,520
♪♪

00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,522
BUT I WANT 100% OF THE BUSINESS,

00:38:27,522 --> 00:38:31,392
AND I'LL GIVE YOU AN OPTION
TO WORK BACK TO 49%.

00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,961
ROBERT HAS MADE MARC
HIS OWN OFFER--

00:38:33,961 --> 00:38:37,632
$250,000 FOR 100%
OF THE COMPANY

00:38:37,632 --> 00:38:40,601
WITH THE OPTION
TO BUY BACK 49% OF IT

00:38:40,601 --> 00:38:43,371
WITH PROFITS
MADE FROM THE BUSINESS.

00:38:43,371 --> 00:38:47,041
UH, UH--
EXCUSE ME. YOUR DEAL
HAS NO ROYALTY IN IT.

00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:49,043
NO ROYALTY.
SO YOU GET NOTHING.

00:38:49,043 --> 00:38:51,112
MAY--MAY I TAKE NOTES?

00:38:51,112 --> 00:38:53,714
(chuckles)
NO, SEE, IT'S VERY SIMPLE.
YOU DON'T NEED TO TAKE NOTES.

00:38:53,714 --> 00:38:57,151
ROBERT JUST OFFERED YOU NOTHING
AND TOLD YOU TO POUND SAND

00:38:57,151 --> 00:39:00,521
FOR A LONG TIME.
NO, I DIDN'T.
I DIDN'T DO THAT.

00:39:00,521 --> 00:39:03,558
I THINK YOU DID.
I GAVE HIM A SHOT
AT THE BRASS RING.

00:39:03,558 --> 00:39:05,593
YOU'RE GIVING HIM NOTHING.

00:39:07,161 --> 00:39:10,164
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

00:39:23,053 --> 00:39:26,074
ALL FIVE SHARKS MADE MARC
AN OFFER TOGETHER,

00:39:26,074 --> 00:39:28,076
BUT ROBERT
HAD A CHANGE OF HEART

00:39:28,076 --> 00:39:30,946
AND MADE HIM AN OFFER
ON HIS OWN.

00:39:30,946 --> 00:39:33,115
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE
A-A PER--A COUNTEROFFER.

00:39:33,115 --> 00:39:35,117
(O'Leary) JUST BEFORE
YOU MAKE THAT MOVE,

00:39:35,117 --> 00:39:36,952
MAYBE YOUR OTHER DEAL
IS GONNA EVAPORATE.

00:39:36,952 --> 00:39:39,388
JUST LIKE A DOG
WITH A BONE IN HIS MOUTH

00:39:39,388 --> 00:39:41,390
LOOKING AT A REFLECTION
IN THE RIVER,

00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:44,192
YOU BETTER MAKE SURE,
BEFORE YOU OPEN YOUR MOUTH,

00:39:44,192 --> 00:39:46,662
THE BONE DOESN'T DROP OUT HERE.
HE'S NOT GONNA DO THE DEAL.
HE'S NOT STUPID.

00:39:46,662 --> 00:39:49,297
I DIDN'T HEAR THAT YET.
I MEAN, I WENT ALONG WITH IT

00:39:49,297 --> 00:39:51,299
BECAUSE I THOUGHT, SURE,
IF HE DOES THE DEAL,

00:39:51,299 --> 00:39:52,687
I'M HAPPY TO GO ALONG WITH IT,
BUT HE'S NOT GONNA DO THE DEAL.

00:39:52,687 --> 00:39:55,657
ARE YOU GONNA LET THAT BONE
DROP OUT OF YOUR MOUTH?

00:39:55,657 --> 00:39:57,659
BECAUSE MAYBE I'LL EVAPORATE
ON THAT.

00:39:57,659 --> 00:39:59,928
OBVIOUSLY I'M GETTING CUT OUT
IN ROBERT'S SCENARIO,

00:39:59,928 --> 00:40:03,331
AND THAT REALLY MAKES ME
QUITE UNHAPPY, MARC.
I'M LESS INTERESTED
IN, UM, JUST ONE.

00:40:03,331 --> 00:40:05,667
I LIKE THE IDEA OF HAVING
FIVE RESOURCES.
NOW I'M OFFENDED.

00:40:05,667 --> 00:40:08,036
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?
NOTHING IS WRONG
WITH YOU, ROBERT.

00:40:08,036 --> 00:40:12,156
I-I REALLY LIKE THE IDEA OF
HAVING FIVE BUSINESS PARTNERS.

00:40:12,156 --> 00:40:14,158
YOU KNOW WHAT, MARC?
FORGET THAT.

00:40:14,158 --> 00:40:16,727
THAT'S JUST
WAY TOO COMPLICATED FOR ME.

00:40:16,727 --> 00:40:18,529
I'LL GIVE YOU $250,000.

00:40:18,529 --> 00:40:21,565
UM, I GET 51%, YOU GET 49%.

00:40:21,565 --> 00:40:24,134
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING.
WHAT HAPPENED THERE?

00:40:24,134 --> 00:40:26,270
ROBERT HAS JUST SWEETENED
HIS OFFER

00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:28,472
BY GIVING MARC THE 49% STAKE
IN HIS COMPANY

00:40:28,472 --> 00:40:31,141
WITHOUT HAVING TO BUY IT BACK.

00:40:31,141 --> 00:40:35,446
YOU'VE JUST SEEN GREED.
THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE SEEN, BUD.

00:40:35,446 --> 00:40:37,448
YOU'VE SEEN A GUY
SCREW HIS PARTNERS.

00:40:37,448 --> 00:40:39,049
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

00:40:39,049 --> 00:40:40,884
YEAH, BUT YOU--
AND I WON'T FORGET THIS,
ROBERT.

00:40:40,884 --> 00:40:42,886
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
DO YOU NEED A HUG, KEVIN?

00:40:42,886 --> 00:40:45,422
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET
ANY HELP FROM ME ON THIS DEAL.
(laughs) AY-YI-YI.

00:40:45,422 --> 00:40:49,760
MARC, YOU HAVE TO START
MAKING A DECISION. WHICH ONE?
THAT--THAT WAS WHY
I WANTED TO TAKE NOTES.

00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,262
YOU KNOW, THE BIG RISK IS YOU'RE
GONNA WALK OUT THE DOOR

00:40:52,262 --> 00:40:55,099
SINGING THE BLUES IN "E."
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE BIG RISK IS?

00:40:55,099 --> 00:40:58,368
I'M GONNA SAY I'M OUT
IN LESS THAN A MINUTE.

00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:00,671
WE'VE BEEN HERE
FOR WAY TOO LONG.
IT'S GETTING MORE COMP--

00:41:00,671 --> 00:41:03,674
IT'S WAY TOO MANY DEALS.
YEAH, IF STUFF IS NOT SIMPLE,
I'M ABOUT TO BE OUT.

00:41:03,674 --> 00:41:06,677
AND I'M A SIMPLE GUY.
I JUST WANT TO MAKE MONEY.
UM, I REALLY LIKE
THE IDEA--

00:41:06,677 --> 00:41:10,214
I-I REALLY LIKE THE IDEA OF
HAVING FIVE BUSINESS PARTNERS.

00:41:10,214 --> 00:41:13,183
MARC REJECTED ROBERT'S OFFER
IN HOPES OF SECURING A DEAL

00:41:13,183 --> 00:41:15,352
WITH ALL FIVE SHARKS TOGETHER.

00:41:15,352 --> 00:41:17,354
CAN YOU, UH, REDESCRIBE

00:41:17,354 --> 00:41:20,758
WHAT YOUR NEW COMPANY
WOULD LOOK LIKE--

00:41:20,758 --> 00:41:22,760
OKAY, ONE MORE TIME
WITH FEELING.

00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,130
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO WRITE
THIS DOWN. IT'S THIS SIMPLE.

00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:28,766
WE FUND THE NEW CO.
WITH $250,000,

00:41:28,766 --> 00:41:33,070
YOU START MAKING 5% FOR THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE ON SALES,

00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:35,472
REGARDLESS OF WHAT
OUR COSTS ARE.

00:41:35,472 --> 00:41:37,474
HE HAS NO EQUITY.
HAS NO EQUITY.
IF YOU WANT--

00:41:37,474 --> 00:41:38,976
OKAY--

00:41:38,976 --> 00:41:41,311
AFTER WE'VE RECOVERED
THE $250,000 INVESTMENT,

00:41:41,311 --> 00:41:43,347
WE LET HIM USE
HIS ROYALTY STREAM

00:41:43,347 --> 00:41:46,517
TO ACQUIRE THE EQUAL EQUITY
AMONGST OURSELVES.

00:41:46,517 --> 00:41:49,453
THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME. THAT'S
REAL DOLLARS FOR REAL EQUITY,

00:41:49,453 --> 00:41:52,790
'CAUSE BY THEN--
IS THAT SOMETHING
YOU'D CONSIDER, MARC?

00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:55,292
UM... THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING
I WOULD CONSIDER,

00:41:55,292 --> 00:41:58,295
BUT I WOULD LIKE THE ROYALTIES
