HI. MY NAME IS MARIAN CRUZ.

00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,751
MY PRODUCT IS THE TurboBaster.

00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,554
I'M SEEKING $35,000
FOR INVESTMENT,

00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:10,724
AND I'M WILLING TO GIVE UP
30% EQUITY IN MY COMPANY.

00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:14,127
I FIRST CAME WITH THIS CONCEPT
ONE THANKSGIVING DAY

00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:17,030
WHEN I WAS COOKING DINNER
FOR MY FAMILY.

00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,733
I WAS USING
A TRADITIONAL BULB BASTER.
(liquid gurgles)

00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:23,470
IT WAS INEFFICIENT. IT WASN'T
EVEN HOLDING ANY OF THE FLUIDS.

00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,472
IT SPLATTERED ALL OVER ME.

00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:28,008
AND I THOUGHT,
"THERE'S GOTTA BE A BETTER WAY."

00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:31,111
SO I DEVELOPED THE TurboBaster.

00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:33,747
IT'S GONNA REPLACE
THE TRADITIONAL BULB BASTER,

00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:35,615
THE BASTING BRUSH.

00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:38,685
IT'S ALSO GONNA REPLACE
THE INJECTOR MARINADE AS WELL.

00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:43,590
SO I CREATED THE TurboBaster.

00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,259
(Robert) WHOO! (laughs)

00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:50,664
THE TurboBaster IS GONNA BE
BATTERY‐OPERATED.

00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:53,934
IT'S GONNA SIPHON UP THE JUICES
MORE EFFICIENTLY.

00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:56,903
IT'S ALSO COME
WITH A SILICONE BASTING BRUSH

00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,907
SO YOU COULD BASTE YOUR FOODS
AND VEGETABLES MORE EFFICIENTLY.

00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,310
IT'S ALSO GONNA COME
WITH AN INJECTOR TIP

00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,579
TO INJECT
YOUR FAVORITE MARINADES.

00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,014

YOU'RE BUILDING A ROCKET.

00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:09,816

I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS

00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,155
AND I THINK THAT ANYONE
THAT LOVES TO COOK WILL NEED

00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:17,657
TO HAVE THE TurboBaster
IN THEIR KITCHEN.
I GOT A QUESTION.

00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:20,060
CAN YOU
ALSO USE THE SAME SYRINGE

00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,195

AS WELL?

00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,264
DAYMOND, YOU'VE NEVER BEEN

00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,234
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE
THE KITCHEN IN YOUR HOUSE IS.
(sharks laugh)

00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:29,669

WITH MOUSSE.

00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:32,773
WE COULD MAKE A SALE HERE, TOO.
HOW DO YOU CLEAN THAT?

00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:35,008
WELL, IT'S GONNA COME APART
FOR EASY CLEANING.

00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,244
CAN YOU DEMONSTRATE THAT HERE?

00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:40,046
WELL, THIS IS
A NONWORKING PROTOTYPE.

00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:42,015
OH, YOU DON'T HAVE ONE YET.

00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,017
NO.

00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,919
NO, BECAUSE‐‐
YOU BUILT A GREAT VIDEO.

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,922
COULD WE HAVE A LOOK
AT THAT, MARIAN?
ABSOLUTELY.

00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:52,292
WHAT'S YOUR ESTIMATED COST
ON MANUFACTURING THESE THINGS?

00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,294
OKAY, I'M THINKING
FASHION KITCHEN COLORS, $19.99,

00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,097
BUT STAINLESS STEEL MODEL,
$29.99.

00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:59,800

MAKE THEM FOR, DO YOU THINK?

00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,869

OUT THERE LIKE THIS?
NO.

00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,910
BUT, MARIAN, PROVE TO ME
THAT THERE'S A MARKET.

00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,912

00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:17,217

AS AN INVESTOR WHO'S GONNA
GIVE YOU THE $35,000,

00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:36,269
COULD FIGURE OUT

00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,208

WHEN I CAME OUT OF THE ROOM,
HE HUGGED ME,

00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:02,081
AND HE SAID,
"LORI, THAT WAS GREAT.

00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,384
YOU CAN HELP THOUSANDS
OF CHILDREN AND PARENTS."

00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:08,054
AND BASICALLY,
IT INSPIRED A WHOLE BUSINESS.

00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:10,990
BUT WHAT I DO TAKES MONEY‐‐
UP‐FRONT MONEY‐‐

00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,393
AND WE'RE ALWAYS GOING
FROM‐‐FROM DOLLAR TO DOLLAR,

00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:17,396
HAND TO MOUTH, AND WE'VE
PUT EVERYTHING ON THE LINE.

00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,665
I MEAN,
MY HOUSE IS ON THE MARKET.

00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:22,134
UM, WE'RE SHARING ONE CAR NOW.

00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,937
I DON'T HAVE
ANYWHERE ELSE TO GO.

00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,440
I KNOW I HAVE AN EFFECTIVE
PRODUCT, BUT I NEED HELP

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,242
TO GET THIS OUT INTO
EVERY HOUSEHOLD IN AMERICA.

00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:32,244
PARENTS NEED TO KNOW
ABOUT MY PRODUCT,

00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:34,280
AND THE SHARKS
CAN HELP ME DO THAT.

00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,551
♪♪

00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,832
HI. I'M LORI LITE,

AND THE NAME OF MY COMPANY
IS STRESS FREE KIDS.

I'M ASKING YOU TO INVEST
$250,000 IN MY COMPANY

IN EXCHANGE FOR 20%.

I'M A HANDS‐ON MOM
THAT HAS DEALT

00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:10,383
WITH REAL STRESS AND ANXIETY
WHILE RAISING MY THREE CHILDREN.

00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:13,052
MY SON WAS HYPERACTIVE.

00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:16,856
EVERY NIGHT, IT TOOK ME
TWO HOURS TO PUT HIM TO BED.

00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:19,225
LUCKILY FOR ME,

00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:22,395
I LEARNED TO DO
STRESS MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES

00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:25,865
THAT HAD AN IMMEDIATE EFFECT
ON ME.

00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:28,501
I WONDERED,
WHAT WOULD IT BE LIKE

00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,971
IF I COULD GET MY <i>SON</i>
TO DO THE SAME TECHNIQUES?

00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:35,107
I BEGAN TO CREATE A STORY
THAT ENTERTAINED HIM,

00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,909
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,

00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:40,746
INCORPORATED AN ACTUAL
STRESS MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUE.

00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:45,451
TO MY AMAZEMENT, MY SON FOLLOWED
ALONG AND FELL ASLEEP.

00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:48,921
NOW I HAVE A WHOLE LINE
OF BOOKS AND CDs

00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,791
THAT HELP CHILDREN
MANAGE STRESS

00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,793
WHILE PROMOTING
THEIR SELF‐ESTEEM

00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:56,429
AND A MORE PEACEFUL SLEEP.

00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:58,431
CAN YOU GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE,

00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:00,700
A QUICK PARAGRAPH
OR SOMETHING?

00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,235
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
SITTING UP HERE...
I CAN.

00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:07,206
WITH THESE PEOPLE‐‐
A LOT OF STRESS.
AND, LORI, WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO READ TO US,

00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,108
DID YOU WRITE THAT YOURSELF?

00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:13,345
YES. I NOT ONLY WROTE,
BUT I PRODUCED AND I PUBLISHED.

00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:16,315
WOW.
OKAY, THIS IS "ANGRY OCTOPUS."

00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:19,819
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF USING
PROGRESSIVE MUSCULAR RELAXATION.

00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:22,088
"AND THE SEA CHILD CONTINUED.

00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:24,256
"'TIGHTEN THE MUSCLES

"'TIGHTEN THEM AS TIGHT
AS YOU CAN. HOLD, HOLD, HOLD.'"

00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,331
AHH!

00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:35,534
AHH!
"NOW LET THE AIR
OUT OF YOUR MOUTH

"AND FEEL ALL THE TENSION
IN YOUR CHEST,

00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:42,108
NECK AND SHOULDERS
DRIFT AWAY."

00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:44,110
IT'S VERY GOOD.

00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:47,179
YEAH, THE WORDS ARE VERY,
UH, VERY SOOTHING.
THANK YOU.

00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,381
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU MADE
IN SALES OF THIS STUFF?

00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:52,952
UH, WELL, LAST YEAR
I MOVED 30,000 UNITS AND...

00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:54,687
(O'Leary) WOW.
WHOA.

00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:56,088
30,000 UNITS?
YES.

00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,791
OUT OF YOUR HOME?
OUT OF YOUR KITCHEN?

00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:02,294
OUT OF MY KITCHEN.
SO, LORI, ON THE 30,000 UNITS
YOU SOLD LAST YEAR...

00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:04,997
YES.
WHAT WAS THE TOTAL SALES?

00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,433
$180,000 IN REVENUES.

00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:12,304
ON THAT $180,000, HOW MUCH DID
YOU MAKE? HOW MUCH WAS LEFT‐‐
$50,000 IN PROFIT.

00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:15,074
WOW.
I'M CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND.
IS HE IN ON THIS WITH YOU?

00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:18,644
WHAT'S HIS ROLE?
OH, YES. WELL, YOU KNOW,
BASICALLY,

00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:21,247
I MADE HIM QUIT HIS JOB.
WHOA.

00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:24,216
HE HELPS WITH SALES
AND MARKETING AND‐‐
SO THE $50,000
THAT YOU MADE PROFIT

00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:26,886
WAS BETWEEN YOU
AND YOUR HUSBAND BOTH?

00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:29,321
WELL, YES. WE'RE MARRIED
FOR 23 YEARS. WE‐‐WE SHARE.

00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,290
IS THERE REAL PROOF OUT THERE

00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,026
THAT CHILDREN <i>ARE</i> FEELING
THIS KIND OF STRESS,

00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:36,562
THAT THERE'S A REAL MARKET
FOR THAT?
THERE IS.

00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:39,498
I THINK IT'S 13 OUT OF A HUNDRED
CHILDREN HAVE ANXIETY DISORDERS.

00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:42,134
WHY HAVEN'T YOU GONE
TO A CHILDREN'S BOOK PUBLISHER

00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:46,505
AND SAY, "LOOK WHAT I'VE DONE.
I'VE SOLD 30,000 OF THESE.

00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:51,143
GIVE ME A DEAL.
I'M A GREAT AUTHOR"?
BECAUSE HONESTLY, MY FIRST TWO
BOOKS WERE WITH A PUBLISHER.

00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,112
AND THEN AFTER THAT,

00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:56,182
I DECIDED THAT I WANTED TO DO
MY OWN PUBLISHING.
WHY?

00:21:56,182 --> 00:21:58,984
WHY DIDN'T IT WORK
WITH THE PUBLISHER?
WHY DIDN'T IT WORK
THE OTHER WAY?

00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,053
UM, WELL, YOU GET PAID
A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE.

00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:04,323
BUT YOU SELL A LOT OF BOOKS.
NO, I SELL MORE BOOKS
BY MYSELF.

00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,693
(O'Leary) WHY DIDN'T YOU SELL
A LOT THROUGH THE PUBLISHER?

00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:11,063
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WENT WRONG THERE?
WELL, UM, THEY DON'T REALLY‐‐
THEY DON'T PROMOTE YOU

00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:14,166
UNLESS YOU'RE A KNOWN NAME.
LORI, HOW MUCH OF YOUR
PERSONAL MONEY IS IN THIS?

00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,568
$200,000.

00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:17,269
ALL OF THE MODELS

00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,605
OF CHILDREN'S BOOKS
AND CHILDREN'S PUBLISHING,

00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:22,441
THE ONLY WAY YOU MAKE MONEY
IN THAT BUSINESS

00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,443
IS YOU GET MASSIVE DISTRIBUTION.

00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:27,847
THERE ARE TWO GIANT RETAILERS
THAT CONTROL

00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:31,383
THE PHYSICAL DISTRIBUTION
AND ONE ONLINE ONE.

00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:35,187
AND UNTIL YOU HAVE
ALL THREE OF THOSE...
AMAZON IS‐‐IS MY BIGGEST.

00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:38,123
(O'Leary) YES. BORDERS?
UH, BORDERS, BARNES &amp; NOBLE.

00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:41,060
YES, I'M ON OR I'M IN
ALL OF THOSE PLACES.
YOU HAVE ALL THE DISTRIBUTION.

00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,562
(O'Leary) BUT THEN WHY
AREN'T THE SALES MORE?
OKAY, BUT DO YOU UNDERSTAND‐‐

00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:48,133
WELL, MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHAT ARE
YOU GONNA DO WITH MY MONEY?
I MEAN, BUT THIS IS‐‐
I‐I‐I REALLY CAN'T BELIEVE

00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:50,836
THAT YOU ARE NOT APPRECIATING
WHAT I'VE DONE.
I VERY MUCH‐‐

00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:54,440
(Robert) NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
WE ARE APPRECIATING IT. IT LOOKS
LIKE A POT OF GOLD RIGHT NOW,

00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,942
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING‐‐
THIS IS A POT OF GOLD.

00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:59,345
THERE IS SOMETHING MISSING.

00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:01,847
WHERE YOU'RE LOSING ME IS,
YOU'RE IN

00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:04,750
EVERY DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL
YOU COULD POSSIBLY BE IN.
YES.

00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,319
I GIVE YOU $250,000...
YES.

00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:10,222
HOW DO AMAZON SALES GO UP?

00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,791
UM, THERE ARE‐‐THERE ARE THINGS
I COULD DO ON AMAZON

00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:16,729
TO PR‐‐TO PROMOTE, ADVERTISING
OPPORTUNITIES THAT WILL PROMOTE.

00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:19,498
BUT, LORI, YOU'RE MAKING,
UH, ABOUT $50,000 A YEAR.

00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:23,202
CORRECT.
YOU KNOW THERE'S
A BAD ECONOMY OUT THERE.

00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:25,304
I KNOW.

00:23:25,304 --> 00:23:28,274
BASED ON YOUR OFFER
OF $250,000 FOR 20%,

00:23:28,274 --> 00:23:32,411
YOU'RE SAYING YOUR BUSINESS
IS WORTH OVER $1 MILLION TODAY.
CORRECT.

00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:35,915
BUT IT'S ONLY EARNING
$50,000.

00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:40,185
HELP ME UNDERSTAND THE GAP.
WELL, I WAS BASING‐‐I'M BASING
THAT BASED ON MY REVENUES,

00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:42,354
YOU KNOW, THAT I'M MAKING.
BUT YOUR REVENUES ARE $180,000.

00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:45,124
BUT I BELIEVE‐‐YOU KNOW,
SOME OF THIS COMES FROM BELIEF.

00:23:45,124 --> 00:23:48,127
YOU KNOW?
WHAT I WAS HOPING
YOU WERE GONNA SAY

00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:51,263
WAS THAT THE REASON
YOU'RE NOT SELLING MORE

00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,232
IS 'CAUSE YOU CAN'T
FUND INVENTORY.
OKAY.

00:23:53,232 --> 00:23:57,269
I THINK, UH, YOUR VALUATION
IS SO CRAZY OUT THERE.

00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:01,106
SO I'M OUT.
WELL, JUST‐‐
OKAY. THAT'S FINE.

00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:04,777
I'LL MAKE IT EASY FROM MY SIDE.
I SEE TEN PRODUCTS HERE.

00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:08,814
I LIKE TO FOCUS ON ONE ITEM THAT
I CAN SELL A MILLION PIECES.

00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:11,350
SO I'M OUT.

00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:14,019

OH, THANK YOU, DAYMOND.

OF A COMPLIMENT. THANK YOU.

I'M GONNA OFFER YOU
THE SAME DEAL, BUT JUST FOR 50%.

50%?

00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:07,439
FOR 50 VERSUS 51.

00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:10,843
NOW YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN 50% AND 51% IS...
YES.

00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:12,778
THAT WE DECIDE TOGETHER
WHAT WE DO.

00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:14,780
WITH DAYMOND, HE WOULD MAKE
ALL THE DECISIONS.

00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,282
HE'D HAVE THE FINAL CALL.
SO YOU'RE SAYING YOU THINK
THIS BUSINESS IS WORTH‐‐

00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:20,386

AS A HUSBAND OF 19 YEARS‐‐

00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:46,178

ALL RIGHT. MAKE THAT CALL.

00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,768
OH, WE'RE‐‐WE'RE
CASH FLOW NEGATIVE.

00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:13,171
SO, JEFF, IF YOU'RE ASKING
FOR HALF A MILLION DOLLARS...
MM‐HMM.

00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,440
FOR 5% OF YOUR BUSINESS...

00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,344
CORRECT.
WHICH MAKES THE OVERALL BUSINESS
WORTH $10 MILLION.

00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:23,548
YES. YES.
(O'Leary) AND YOU'VE ONLY SOLD
$400,000 WORTH OF GUITARS.

00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:27,786
RIGHT.
DO YOU SEE ANY
PROBLEM WITH THAT?

00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:31,189
I‐I SEE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT.
I THINK‐‐
I SEE GREED. I SEE GREED.

00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:35,560
WELL, THIS IS A PRODUCT
THAT HAS A 50% GROSS MARGIN.

00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,562
THERE ARE
3 MILLION GUITARS SOLD

00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:39,731
JUST IN THE UNITED STATES
EVERY YEAR,

00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:43,034
AND THERE IS ABSOLUTELY
NO REASON WHY ANYBODY

00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,537
THAT BUYS A GUITAR TODAY
WOULDN'T WANT THE FLEXIBILITY

00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:49,140
TO BE ABLE TO FOLD IT IN HALF
AND TAKE IT WITH THEM.
LET ME ASK

00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:52,143
A REALLY SIMPLE QUESTION
BEFORE YOU GO ANY FURTHER.

00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:55,146
I KNOW I LOOK LIKE A HIP
ROCK STAR‐‐I REALIZE THAT‐‐

00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:57,916
BUT I ACTUALLY DON'T PLAY
THE GUITAR.

00:36:57,916 --> 00:37:00,085
IF THE HINGE IS UNIQUE
AND PATENTED...
MM‐HMM. YEP.

00:37:00,085 --> 00:37:03,521
THERE ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE
THAT MAKE GUITARS ALREADY.
RIGHT.

00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:08,760
WHY NOT LICENSE
THE HINGE IDEA TO THEM,

00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,796
SIT AT HOME,
COLLECT THE ROYALTY,

00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:14,599
WHICH MEANS
THEY JUST SEND YOU THE MONEY

00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:17,068
EVERY TIME THEY SELL ONE‐‐
WELL‐‐

00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:20,105
(O'Leary) WHY AREN'T YOU
DOING THAT?
IT‐‐IT'S EASIER TO GET THEM
TO COME TO THE TABLE

00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:22,107
IF I'VE DEMONSTRATED MARKET
ACCEPTANCE OF THIS PRODUCT.

00:37:22,107 --> 00:37:25,343
ONCE I'VE DEMONSTRATED‐‐
WE HAVE TO BUILD
A WHOLE GUITAR COMPANY‐‐

00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:27,479
I'VE ALREADY DONE IT.
I'VE ALREADY DONE IT.

00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:30,348
I HAVE
COMPLETE MANUFACTURING‐‐
BUT YOU HAVEN'T SOLD ANY YET.

00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:33,384
I HAVE‐‐WE JUST LAUNCHED.
(Robert) JEFF, YOU CONFUSE ME
A LITTLE BIT.

00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:36,387
OKAY.
'CAUSE I'M NOT CLEAR.
I MEAN, ANSWER THIS FOR ME.

00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:39,023
OKAY.
DO YOU WANT TO MAKE
A GREAT GUITAR

00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:41,025
OR DO YOU WANT TO MAKE
A LOT OF MONEY?

00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:43,762
WELL, I WANT TO MAKE
A LOT OF MONEY...
NO, NO, NO, NO.

00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:46,464
BUILDING A GREAT GUITAR.
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE
A GREAT GUITAR.

00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:49,367
I JUST WANT TO MAKE
A LOT OF MONEY.
YOU KNOW‐‐

00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:51,803
AND I THINK YOU HAVE
A GREAT PRODUCT.

00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:54,239
I THINK WE CAN LICENSE IT.

00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:58,209
WHAT WILL YOU SELL ME
THE RIGHTS TO THAT PATENT FOR?

00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:01,913
I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN...

00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:04,783
49%, 51%...

00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:07,552
(Robert) OKAY.

DO YOU SAY A MILLION?
YES.

00:38:10,188 --> 00:38:12,624
(Harrington) A MILLION.

OKAY.

00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:29,407

00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:32,143

I'LL GIVE YOU $500,000

SO‐‐SO ANSWER THE QUESTION
FOR ME.

00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:45,557
WHY DO I NEED YOU
TO LICENSE THE GUITAR?

00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:48,827
I HAVE TREMENDOUS EXPERIENCE
IN THE LICENSE SPACE.
