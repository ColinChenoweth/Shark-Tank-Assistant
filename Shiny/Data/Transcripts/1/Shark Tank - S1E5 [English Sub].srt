I'VE HAD HUGE SUCCESS.

00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,983

I'VE SOLD TEN MILLION OF 'EM.

THERE'S NO QUESTION.

00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:05,358
YOUR PARTNER HAS TO HAVE
SKIN IN THE GAME,

00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,800

THAT RATIO DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:30,483
IF YOU HAVE THE KIND OF MONEY
YOU'VE TOLD US YOU HAVE,

00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:33,486
YOU SHOULD
BE FUNDING THIS YOURSELF.

00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:37,424
WHY GIVE UP 20% OF THE BUSINESS
WHEN YOU CAN HAVE 100% OF IT?

00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:40,126
IT DOESN'T ADD UP FOR ME.
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.

00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,796
(Harrington) UM, CACTUS,
I LOVE THE FITNESS CATEGORY.

00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,965

THE CONTINGENCY TO BE

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,082

YOUR NEW MACHINE OUT,

00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:39,786

PHOTOS BEFORE AND AFTER‐‐

00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:43,390

AND I SAID, "HEY, BABE.
IT WOULD BE SO GREAT

00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:30,550
IF WE COULD MAKE SOMETHING THAT
I COULD ACTUALLY EAT SOMETIME."

00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,318
(sharks laugh)

00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:35,388
YOU KNOW WHAT, JEFF? I SAY THAT
TO MY WIFE <i>ALL</i> THE TIME.
(laughs)

00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,723
WELL, MY‐‐MY SON WAS 15
AT THE TIME,

00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,725
AND HE SAID,
"YOU KNOW, DAD, LET'S DO THAT.

00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,827
LET'S MAKE SOMETHING
THAT <i>I</i> LIKE THAT <i>YOU</i> CAN EAT."

00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:44,497
AND SO WE SPENT THAT ENTIRE
2‐WEEK HOLIDAY PERIOD

00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:47,867
LEARNING WHAT INGREDIENTS
ON THE GLYCEMIC INDEX WERE LOW.

00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,702
IDENTIFYING THE FACT

00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:52,338
THAT IT LOOKED LIKE WE COULD
MAKE A GRANOLA OUT OF THIS,

00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:54,340
MY WIFE STARTED
EATING THESE WITH US,

00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,576
AND SHE GAVE ME
THE GREATEST COMPLIMENT‐‐

00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,678
"JEFF, YOU KNOW WHAT? THESE,
UH, FRUIT FLAVORED BARS...

00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:01,614
THEY'RE OKAY."
JEFF, HOW LONG YOU BEEN MARRIED?

00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:03,249
UH, 20 YEARS TODAY.

00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,751
'CAUSE I'VE BEEN MARRIED
FOR ALMOST 20 YEARS.

00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,588
ISN'T IT FUNNY
THAT AFTER 20 YEARS,

00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,957
"OKAY" FROM YOUR WIFE
IS, LIKE, "WHOO!"?

00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:13,192
(both laugh)

00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:16,095
IT USED TO BE,
"YOU'RE WONDERFUL."

00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,098
NOW IT'S LIKE, "YOU'RE OKAY."
YOU GET THE GOD'S HONEST
FROM YOUR SPOUSE.

00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,000
TOO HONEST SOMETIMES.
SOMETIMES.

00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,970
OUR REAL SUCCESS HAS BEEN IN
THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION

00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,872
OF THE NATION'S
LARGEST NATURAL FOOD MARKET,

00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:29,008
WHOLE FOODS.

00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:32,078
FRANKLY, WE WORKED REAL HARD
TO GET IN.

00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:35,081
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES
WITH WHOLE FOODS?
WELL, WITH WHOLE FOODS
RIGHT NOW,

00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:37,316
WE'RE DOING SOMEWHERE ABOUT
$8,000 OR $10,000 A MONTH.

00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,952
WHAT ARE YOUR TOTAL SALES?
THAT'S MOST OF OUR SALES.

00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,455
ARE YOU SELLING
AT ONE WHOLE FOODS STORE?

00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,457
WE'RE IN 90%
OF THE WHOLE FOODS STORES

00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,960
IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
MARKET.
HOW MANY STORES IS THAT?

00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,696
UH, RIGHT NOW, THAT'S 24.
ARE YOU GETTING REORDERS?

00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:54,266
EVERY WEEK OR TWO WEEKS,
WE'RE IN REFILLING OUR RACK.
FOR A BUSINESS
THAT'S BEEN UP AND RUNNING

00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:57,637
LESS THAN A YEAR?
GOOD FOR YOU.
WE'VE ACTUALLY
ONLY BEEN DOING IT

00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:00,172
FOR ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN MONTHS.
BUT WHY AREN'T YOU
AT OTHER STORES?

00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,975
LET'S FORGET THE OTHER STORES
FOR A SECOND,

00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,211
BECAUSE I LIKE YOUR APPROACH.
YOU GOT INTO WHOLE FOODS.

00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:07,480
STEP ONE. THEY GOT BEHIND YOU.
STEP TWO.

00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,351
TO ME, STEP THREE IS ROLL IT OUT
NATIONALLY TO WHOLE FOODS.

00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,654
THAT WILL INCREASE YOUR SALES.

00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:18,157
AND THEN GO TO OTHER RETAILERS
ONCE IT'S ON A NATIONAL BASIS.

00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,660
WHY HAVEN'T YOU DONE THAT?
IT REQUIRES CASH.

00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,162
RIGHT NOW, WE'VE BEEN
BOOTSTRAPPING THE COMPANY

00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,999
FROM THE BEGINNING.
AND WHY HAVE YOU COME TO US
INSTEAD OF GOING TO A BANK?

00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,968
I HAD A SOFTWARE COMPANY.
I HAD PERSONALLY GUARANTEED

00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:31,103
A LOT OF LOANS
FOR THAT BUSINESS.

00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:33,539
AFTER SIX YEARS
OF HAVING RUN IT SUCCESSFULLY,

00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,841
I GOT STUCK
WITH A NUMBER OF THOSE LOANS

00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,844
AFTER SELLING SOME OF THE ASSETS
OF THE FIRM AND CLOSING IT.

00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,647
THAT BUSINESS WENT BANKRUPT
IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:46,485
UH, I HAD A PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY
BECAUSE OF IT.

00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:49,388
YOU WANT ME
TO GIVE YOU $175,000,

00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:52,024
AND I'LL GET 25%
OF YOUR COMPANY,

00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:55,494
SO I'D CALCULATE YOUR WHOLE
COMPANY AS WORTH $700,000 NOW

00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,530
WITH $80,000 A YEAR
WORTH OF SALES.

00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,498
I DON'T SEE HOW
IT'S WORTH $700,000.

00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:03,235
I AGREE
IT'S NOT WORTH $700,000.
HE'S DOING 80 TO 90 GRAND
A YEAR IN SALES.

00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:05,271
JEFF, LET'S BE REAL.
YOU WENT BANKRUPT.

00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:09,175
THAT WIPED OUT YOUR ABILITY
TO RAISE MONEY FROM A BANK.

00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:11,877
THAT'S LIFE.
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,647
YOUR BUSINESS
IS NOT WORTH $700,000.

00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:17,349
IT'S PROBABLY WORTH

00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,852
A COUPLE OF HUNDRED THOUSAND
DOLLARS RIGHT NOW‐‐

00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:22,922
TWO TIMES SALES‐‐
THAT'S WHAT I THINK.

00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:24,924
FOR ME TO GIVE YOU $175,000,

00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:26,959
I'D HAVE TO OWN
YOUR WHOLE COMPANY.

00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,997
I PUT A NUMBER OUT THERE
THAT I DIDN'T THINK

00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:34,100
WAS GONNA BE
AN OUTRAGEOUS NUMBER

00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,136
BUT WAS SOMETHING
WE COULD WORK FROM TOGETHER.

00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:39,472
JEFF, I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
MY TAKE ON THIS RIGHT NOW,

00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:42,108

WHAT IS ME, TOO?

THERE'S 90 OTHER GUYS

00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:52,151

00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,031

A LOT MORE MONEY,

00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:12,505

BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY,

00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:15,674
I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER SEE
A RETURN ON MY INVESTMENT.

00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,176

00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:26,218
JEFF, I UNDERSTAND
YOUR DECISION TO GO BANKRUPT.

00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:28,754
IT CLEANS THE SLATE.

00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:31,223
BUT IT CARRIES A WEIGHT.

00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:34,393
IF I WAS YOUR PARTNER,
AND THE BUSINESS WAS SUCCESSFUL,

00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:36,395
WE WOULD REQUIRE MORE CAPITAL,

00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:39,431
AND NO BANK IS GOING
TO LOAN YOU ANY MONEY.

00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:44,203
THAT CAUSES ME TO PUT UP
MORE CAPITAL AND MORE CAPITAL

00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,883
THE PROBLEM IS,
EVERYTHING YOU'VE LISTED,

00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:52,918
WITH THE EXCEPTION, PERHAPS,

00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:55,187
OF THE PARTY CELEBRATION
PLANNING,

00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:58,424
IS INCORPORATED INTO MOST
FUNERAL HOME BUSINESS MODELS.

00:25:58,424 --> 00:26:01,693
TELL ME WHY YOU THINK
YOU CAN COMPETE

00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:04,496
WITH EVERY FUNERAL HOME WHEN YOU
DON'T HAVE ONE YOURSELF.

00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:08,667
AND THAT'S WHY YOUR SALES
ARE SO LOW.
THE REASON WHY MY SALES ARE
SO LOW IS BECAUSE OF EXPOSURE.

00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:11,503
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
THAT CELEBRANTS EXIST.
OKAY, RIKKI, LET'S ROLE‐PLAY.

00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:15,774
SOMEBODY IN MY FAMILY JUST DIED.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU EXIST.
RIGHT.

00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:17,776
I'M SITTING DOWN
WITH THE DIRECTOR SAYING,

00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:19,912
"I'M STRICKEN WITH GRIEF.
HELP ME GET THROUGH THIS."

00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:22,081
AND HE'S UPSELLING ME
LIKE CRAZY. WHERE ARE YOU?

00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,349
YOU'RE NOWHERE. YOU'RE NOT
EVEN INSIDE THAT ROOM,

00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:26,785
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
IN THE FUNERAL PARLOR.

00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:30,222
THE BODIES ALWAYS GO THERE
FIRST. THEY DON'T COME TO YOU.

00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:32,291
YOU HAVE NO DEAD GUY MAGNET.

00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:35,094
SO ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT I ACTUALLY USE

00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,096
TO ATTRACT CLIENTS‐‐
I HAVE A THERAPY DOG,

00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,598
AND WE VISIT HOSPICE
AND NURSING HOMES.

00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,334
AND AS PEOPLE DIE‐‐
YOU WAIT FOR PEOPLE TO DIE?

00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:45,604
THAT'S ONE OF THE WAYS
THAT WE GET BUSINESS, YES.
(Robert) OH, COME ON.

00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:50,409
DOES HE KIND OF SMELL
WHO'S ABOUT TO CROAK?
I WISH HE COULD. THAT WOULD
MAKE IT A LOT EASIER.

00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:54,012
DO YOU NOT THINK YOU'RE
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE?
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:56,815
YOU'RE GOING OUT
TO PEOPLE WITH A DOG

00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,817
TO MAKE THEM FEEL COMFORTABLE...
RIGHT.

00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:01,854
SO YOU CAN SIGN
THEIR FAMILY UP FOR THIS DEAL?

00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:04,423
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S WRONG WITH
IT. SHE'S NOT CHARGING FOR IT.
KEVIN, KEVIN. KEVIN,
JUST SHUT UP FOR A SEC.

00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:07,526
NO. THERE'S NO MONEY IN IT.
NO, NO, NO.
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:10,362
I KNOW YOU DON'T
GIVE A CRAP, BUT‐‐
I DO GIVE A CRAP. SHE'S MAKING
NO MARGIN ON THE DOG.

00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:13,031
(Robert) THERE'S A MORE
FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM

00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:15,634
WITH THIS PRESENTATION.
YOU'RE TRYING TO GET IN FRONT

00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,103
OF PEOPLE IN THEIR MOMENT
OF NEED...
ABSOLUTELY.

00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:20,906
AND YOU'RE TRYING TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THEIR GRIEF.
NO, I'M TRYING TO GET BUSINESS.

00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:24,510
(O'Leary) LIKE EVERY FUNERAL
HOME DOES, ROBERT, EVERY DAY.
EXACTLY.
THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE.

00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:27,212
(Robert) I THINK SHE'S A SLICK
BUSINESSWOMAN, AND I THINK,

00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:29,715
DEEP DOWN, SHE KNOWS SHE'S
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE.

00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:32,484
AND SHE DOESN'T HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH IT. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

I DO, AND I DON'T WANT TO BE
IN BUSINESS WITH YOU

00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:37,256
FOR THAT REASON.
I'M OUT.

IS THAT YOUR MOM?
SURE. YES, IT IS.

00:27:52,938 --> 00:27:56,642
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE
WOULD THINK OF THE BUSINESS?
IF MY MOTHER WAS ALIVE,

00:27:56,642 --> 00:27:58,644
I HONESTLY WOULDN'T BE HERE
IN BUSINESS TODAY,

00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:01,413
BECAUSE MY BUSINESS
IS A TRIBUTE TO HER.

I THINK HER LOOKING DOWN ON ME

00:28:03,482 --> 00:28:06,585
SHE IS SO IMPRESSED AND AMAZED
AND VERY, VERY PROUD OF ME.

00:28:06,585 --> 00:28:09,188
SO ROBERT IS ACTUALLY WRONG
IN THINKING THAT YOU'RE

00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:12,257
JUST TRYING TO MANIPULATE
AND COME IN AND TAKE ADVANTAGE

00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:14,159
OF THAT FACT THAT
SOMEBODY'S GRIEVING?

00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,995
IT'S NOT ABOUT MANIPULATING
AND TAKING ADVANTAGE AT ALL.

00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:19,398
SOMEBODY HAS TO OFFICIATE
THE FUNERAL SERVICE.

00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:21,433
SO WHY NOT US?

00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,335
THE BOTTOM LINE
IS THE MONEY HERE.

00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:28,040

00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,143
I DON'T SEE MARGINS.
I DON'T SEE PROFIT IN THERE.

00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:32,203
I‐I'M GONNA BOW OUT AND‐‐
LET ME SAY THAT
THIS IS...

00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:33,872
THANK YOU.
THE INFANCY.

00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:36,041
I'M OUT.

00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:38,743
THIS IS THE INFANCY
OF THIS WEB SITE.

00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,046
WE'RE CURRENTLY
IN THIRD STAGE CONVERSATIONS

00:34:41,046 --> 00:34:44,249
WITH AETNA,
THE INSURANCE COMPANY.

00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:47,452
THEY HAVE 37 MILLION
PEOPLE WITH‐‐
TELL US ABOUT THAT.

00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:50,055
(Robert)
SEE, THAT'S INTERESTING.
THAT'S INTERESTING. NOW YOU'VE
GOT MY JUICES FLOWING.

00:34:50,055 --> 00:34:52,223
SURE. WE GOT CONNECTED
TO SOME FOLKS THAT SAW

00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:56,127
THE POTENTIAL OF OUR PRODUCT
IN AN INSURANCE WORLD.
SO, RODOLFO,
NOW YOU'RE INTERESTING.

00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:59,631
OKAY.
UP UNTIL THIS POINT,
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT...

00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:02,500
OKAY.
YOU HAD INSIGNIFICANT USERS.

00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,703
OKAY.
FRANKLY, THE SITE...

00:35:04,703 --> 00:35:07,138
REALLY INSIGNIFICANT.

00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:08,940
IT'S VERY SIMPLE.

00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,277
IT'S REALLY AN ONLINE JOURNAL.
BUT WHO CARES?

00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:16,181
IF YOU CAN GET
A LARGE INSURANCE COMPANY...

00:35:16,181 --> 00:35:18,583
YEAH, YEAH. I GET THE JOKE.
I GET THE JOKE.

00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:21,686
TO PROMOTE THIS AS PART
OF GET‐WELL THERAPY,

00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:25,023
WELL, MY FRIENDS,
MY FELLOW IMMIGRANT FRIENDS...
RIGHT.

00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:27,325
RIGHT.
WE'RE ON TO SOMETHING.

00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:29,594
IT'S VERY CLEAR.

00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:32,597
A LARGE INSURANCE COMPANY
SIGNS UP...
CORRECT.

00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:35,900
PROVIDES THIS TO THEIR MEMBERS‐‐
IN FACT, BETTER SCENARIO‐‐

00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:39,371
THEY FORCE THEIR MEMBERS
TO GET INSURANCE TO LOG ON.

00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:41,539
EVERYBODY HAS TO PAY YOU
A CERTAIN FEE.

00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:44,376
LET ME THROW OUT
AN IDEA TO YOU.
YES.

00:35:44,376 --> 00:35:49,080
WHAT IF I GAVE YOU $80,000
FOR 50%?

00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,283
OKAY.

00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:54,419
IS IT CONTINGENT ON AETNA?

00:35:54,419 --> 00:35:57,288
BECAUSE I'D BE INTERESTED
IN POTENTIALLY COMING IN

00:35:57,288 --> 00:36:01,026
FOR MAYBE EVEN MORE MONEY,
BUT TO ME,

00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:03,662
THE COMPANY HAS NO VALUE‐‐
UNTIL THE AETNA DEAL.

00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:06,965
NO VALUE... OR ANY OTHER
SIMILAR INSURANCE COMPANY.
I'D WANT TO‐‐

00:36:06,965 --> 00:36:09,434
I'D BE WILLING
TO PARTNER WITH YOU,

00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:11,936
BECAUSE I THINK THE POTENTIAL
IS VERY INTERESTING.

00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:14,039
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU STARTED
THE PRESENTATION,

00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:17,909
I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST ANOTHER
INTERNET BIRDBRAIN IDEA.

00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:20,779
LOTS OF THOSE ARE OUT THERE.

00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:24,983
YOU GUYS
ARE NOT CRAZY CHICKENS.

00:36:24,983 --> 00:36:27,018
GUYS, I WANT IN ON THIS.

00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,888
SO, RODOLFO,
HERE'S THE OFFER,

00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:31,956
AND, UH, DAYMOND AND KEVIN‐‐

00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:36,294

OF THE BUSINESS.

00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:39,464
THAT'S THE OFFER.
GENTLEMEN, DID YOU NOTICE THAT
SUBTLE CHANGE THAT HAPPENED

00:36:39,464 --> 00:36:41,800
IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES?
WHO ARE YOU?

00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,502
I JUST WANT TO BRING
YOUR ATTENTION TO IT.
ARE YOU THE OFFER MAKER?

00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:47,005
BARBARA. BARB. BARB.
CAN WE HELP YOU?
WHO'S THIS?

00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:49,908
I THOUGHT I HAD HEARD 50%.
(Robert) I HEAR A VOICE...

00:36:49,908 --> 00:36:51,876
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
I'M HEARING 51%.
BUT I DON'T SEE ANYBODY.

00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,878
DID YOU CATCH THAT LITTLE 1%?
YEP.
WE'RE CATCHING EVERYTHING.

00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,181
(Alexis) YES. (laughs)
RODOLFO, MY FRIEND KEVIN
MADE A SUBTLE MISTAKE.

00:36:56,181 --> 00:36:59,484
BECAUSE WHAT YOU REALLY NEED,
ALONG WITH THE MONEY,

00:36:59,484 --> 00:37:01,519
IS YOU NEED SOME GUIDANCE.
YES.

00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:05,590
AND BETWEEN MR. BILLIONAIRE
SELLER OF SOFTWARE BUSINESS

00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:08,626
AND MR. INTERNET OVER HERE,
I THINK THAT THERE IS

00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:11,863
A TREMENDOUS VALUE ON THAT.
YOU COULDN'T HAVE
BETTER PARTNERS.

00:37:11,863 --> 00:37:14,766
LISTEN, COULD WE TAKE
A MOMENT? OKAY?
TAKE A MOMENT. TAKE A MOMENT.

00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:16,034
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

00:37:16,034 --> 00:37:18,837
ROBERT?
YEP.

00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:21,039
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO THINK OF ME AS COLD.

00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:26,077
YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK
OF YOU THAT WAY, KEVIN.

OF MONEY FOR ANY OF US.

I GOT A GOOD FEELING
ABOUT THAT.
YEAH.

00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:21,539
IMAGINE THEY WERE GONNA LEAVE

00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,175
BEFORE THEY MENTIONED
THAT INSURANCE DEAL.
I'M AMAZED.

00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:26,677
I MEAN, WHY WERE THEY
HOLDING THAT BACK?
BARBARA,
THAT'S WHY THEY NEED US.

00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:29,547
'CAUSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
THE FIRST TWO WORDS

00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,783
OUT OF MY MOUTH
WHEN I WALKED OUT THERE.
YEAH.

00:42:31,783 --> 00:42:33,718

THANKS. OH.

<i>NEXT WEEK ON "SHARK TANK"...</i>
FOR MOST OF MY ADULT LIFE,
I'VE HAD EXCESSIVE, BAD GAS.

00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:04,515

WHY IS THIS COMPANY
VALUED AT $1 MILLION?

00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:07,552
THEY'RE JUST JOKING ABOUT THAT.
I'VE ACTUALLY WORKED IN V. C.

00:43:07,552 --> 00:43:10,388
IF YOU'VE WORKED
IN VENTURE CAPITAL, THEN MY JOB

00:43:10,388 --> 00:43:13,925
IS TO SQUEEZE YOUR HEAD LIKE
A TEENAGE PIMPLE RIGHT NOW.

00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:17,528
I CAN'T LOOK AT YOU WITHOUT
PICTURING YOU IN A PIG COSTUME.
WHY DON'T YOU PUT OUT A NUMBER?

00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:19,430
NO, I CAN'T NEGOTIATE
WITH MYSELF.

00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,199
YOU PULL THE LEVER.
I'M GIVING YOU THE POWER.

00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:23,868
OH, MY GOD. THIS GUY'S GREAT.
I LOVE THIS GUY.
HE IS. HE IS, RIGHT?
