THERE'S ONLY TWO KINDS OF PEOPLE

00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,545
THERE ARE PEOPLE
WHO TRULY BELIEVE IT

DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER.

00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:30,449
AND THEN THERE ARE PEOPLE
WHO MAKE 'EM

OF PEOPLE'S DESIRES AND NEEDS.

00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:39,058

CANCER FOR PEOPLE'S PETS.

00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:46,478
PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE
TO BE TRAINED

00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:48,047
IN VIRTUAL DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENT

00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,115
WITHOUT THE RISK
FOR HUMAN LIFE.

00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:52,451
HOW MUCH WOULD IT BE
FOR PEOPLE'S HOMES?

00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:54,453
DO YOU‐‐
IS THERE AN APPLICATION?

00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:56,822
IN FUTURE, THE PRICE COULD DROP
MAYBE EVEN TO $10,000,

00:25:56,822 --> 00:26:00,626
BUT RIGHT NOW, THE PRICE,
UH, IS $55,000.

00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:05,497
AND GOING BACK
TO THE GAMING APPLICATION‐‐

00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:09,601
IS THIS SOMETHING THAT I CAN ADD
TO AN EXISTING GAME?
YES, WE CAN. THE BIGGEST
ASSET ABOUT VIRTUSPHERE

00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:11,603
IS OUR DIVERSITY IN MARKETS,

00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:15,207
FROM MILITARY TO VIDEO GAMES
TO ENTERTAINMENT TO FITNESS.

00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:18,210
BUT THIS IS CLEARLY
NOT GOING TO BE AN EASY SELL

00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,212
TO THE CONSUMER IN THEIR HOME.

00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:23,182
YOU'RE THINKING MORE OF
AN ARCADE ENVIRONMENT FOR THIS?
VIRTU‐VIR‐VIRTUAL
ARCADES.

00:26:23,182 --> 00:26:25,417
SO AGAIN, BASED ON THE SAME,
UH, PRINCIPLE

00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,419
AS A PAINTBALL OR LASER TAG,

00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,888
WE WOULD ADD MULTIPLE SPHERES
IN A ROOM JUST LIKE THIS,

00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:31,390
WHERE TEN SPHERES‐‐

00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,892
PEOPLE WOULD COME IN TOGETHER,
PLAY AGAINST EACH OTHER,

00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:36,395
INSIDE THE SAME
VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT.

00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:38,897
I‐I BUY IT. I SEE
THE APPLICATION. FANTASTIC.

00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:41,533
BUT ALL THREE OF US KNOW

00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:45,404
THAT YOU ARE LIGHT‐YEARS AWAY
FROM A CONSUMER APPLICATION.

00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:47,840
WOULD YOU AGREE?
YES.

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,008
HAVE YOU SOLD ANY TO MILITARY?
YEAH.

00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:52,845
FOR HOW MUCH?
E‐EACH OF THEM,
WE'VE SOLD FOR $50,000.

00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:56,115
WHAT'S IT COST YOU
TO BUILD ONE OF THESE?
$14,000.

00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:58,584
HOW MANY DO YOU HAVE TO SELL
IN A YEAR

00:26:58,584 --> 00:27:01,320
FOR YOU TO BE PROFITABLE?
30.

00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,821
30?
YES.

00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:05,824
SO I CAN BUY 10% OF YOUR COMPANY
FOR 1 MILLION AND A HALF,

00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:08,527
WHICH TELLS ME YOU THINK
IT'S WORTH $15 MILLION,

00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:11,196
AND YOU HAVEN'T MADE ANY MONEY
YET. IT'S A HELL OF A BET.

00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:13,699
WHAT MARKET WOULD YOU PICK
YOU THINK HAS

00:27:13,699 --> 00:27:17,069
THE LEAST PATH OF RESISTANCE
TO SELLING 30 OF THESE SPHERES?

00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:18,570
THE ARMY RECRUITING CENTERS.

00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,739
THERE ARE 1,600 RECRUITMENT
CENTERS ACROSS AMERICA,

00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:23,809
AND LAST YEAR THEY HAD
A $7.7 BILLION BUDGET.

00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:26,945
THE U. S. ARMY ALONE
HAS 400,000 SOLDIERS.

00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:30,149
SO AGAIN, WE CAN HELP THEM
RECRUIT NEW STAFF,

00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:32,784
AND THEY HAVE AN EXISTING GAME
CALLED "AMERICA'S ARMY."

00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:34,786
WE'VE OPENED UP A DISCUSSION

00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:38,090
TO MAKE A COMPATIBLE VIRTUSPHERE
WITH THEM.

00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:40,626
IMAGINE PUTTING A VIRTUSPHERE
IN AN ARMY RECRUITMENT CENTER.

00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:42,628
PEOPLE WILL BE LINING UP
AT THE DOOR

00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:44,630
TO AT LEAST TALK TO THEM,
GIVING THEM A HOOK

00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:47,432
TO GET PEOPLE IN THE DOOR
TO HELP OUR COUNTRY FIGHT WARS

00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:49,735
ACROSS THE NATION.
JIM, WHAT WOULD YOU DO
WITH THE MONEY?

00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:52,137
THERE ARE 59 MILITARY BASES
THAT WE'VE TARGETED

00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:54,940
THROUGHOUT AMERICA TO GO VISIT,
TO DEMONSTRATE,

00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:58,377
TO PROVE A CONCEPT. WE CAN GO
TO THE THEME PARK INDUSTRY.
THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT,

00:27:58,377 --> 00:28:00,379
THE FARTHER AWAY
I THINK THIS IS

00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:03,015
FROM A CONSUMER APPLICATION,
IF EVER.

00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:06,084
WHAT‐‐WHAT DO YOU‐‐
WHAT DO YOU THINK, KEVIN?

00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,587
I‐‐
DO YOU EVER SEE THIS
GOING TO A CONSUMER LEVEL?

00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:11,990
I'M‐‐I'M REALLY TORN ON THIS.
I SEE IT
AS AN ARCADE OPPORTUNITY.

00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:14,626
I MEAN, YOU THINK ABOUT‐‐
THE AVERAGE HOME IS NOT

00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,628
GONNA BE ABLE TO TAKE
THAT SPHERE IN.

00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:18,964
"HONEY, THE DOME IS HERE."
(laughs)

00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:21,767
(O'Leary) LIKE,
THINK ABOUT THAT. IT IS UNIQUE.

00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:25,103
THERE'S NO QUESTION. I'VE NEVER
SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT.
THANK YOU.

00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:28,707
BUT I'M OUT.
OKAY. THANK YOU.

00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,976
JIM, I‐I HAVE TWO PROBLEMS.
YEAH. YEAH.

00:28:30,976 --> 00:28:32,978
IF THIS BECAME
A CONSUMER APPLICATION,

00:28:32,978 --> 00:28:34,947
THERE'D BE, I THINK,
A LOT OF LIABILITY

00:28:34,947 --> 00:28:37,849
FROM PEOPLE GETTING HURT
INSIDE THE BALL.

00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:39,985
AND SECONDLY, IT'S‐‐
I THINK IT'S A LONG TIME

00:28:39,985 --> 00:28:42,621
BEFORE I WOULD GET
MY MONEY BACK, SO I'M OUT.

00:28:42,621 --> 00:28:44,223
OKAY, THANK YOU.

00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:49,294
IT'S SUCH A BOY THING.
I CAN'T EVEN RELATE TO IT,

00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:52,898
AND IT'S CERTAINLY TOO RICH
FOR ME, SO I'M OUT.

00:28:57,135 --> 00:29:00,038
I THINK YOU NEED
A STRATEGIC PARTNER,

00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:02,541
WHICH I WOULD NOT BE ABLE
TO ASSIST YOU WITH THIS.

00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:04,810
I THINK THERE'S
A LOT OF MAINTENANCE

00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:08,614
AND‐‐AND A WORLD OF THINGS
I HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT. I'M OUT.

00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,722

IN THE SHARK TANK

THAT I LOVED THIS MUCH.

00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:22,961

AND THERE'S NO DATA.

00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:25,831
WE JUST DON'T KNOW
WHO'S GONNA BUY IT.

00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:30,068
HAVING SOLD 10 OR 15 OF THEM,
IT'S‐‐IT'S SO FAR AWAY

00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:34,473
FROM THE 1 AND A HALF MILLION
YOU'RE ASKING FOR.

00:29:34,473 --> 00:29:35,974
IT'S A TOUGH ONE.

OH, NO, NO, NO. WE COULDN'T
SURVIVE. LOOK AT US.

00:34:22,294 --> 00:34:25,263
WE'RE VERY HIGH MAINTENANCE.
WELL, THAT'S‐‐THAT'S‐‐
MY NEXT QUESTION WAS...

00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:28,300
YOU KNOW WE NEED MORE MONEY
THAN THAT.
MY NEXT QUESTION WAS GONNA BE
WHAT DO YOU EAT?

00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,036
WHAT DO YOU SURVIVE ON?
WELL, YOU CAN SEE
WE'RE EATING CARBOHYDRATES.

00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:33,538
THAT'S ALL WE CAN AFFORD,
YOU KNOW?
(sharks laugh)

00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:36,775
SO‐‐
OKAY, GAYLA, SO I'M STUCK
ON ONE THING, AND IT‐‐

00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:39,177
OKAY.
THE SKINNY BUYER
THAT BUYS FASHION‐‐

00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:41,246
THEY WON'T PUT LARGER SIZES
INTO RETAIL.

00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:43,348
I GOTTA KNOW WHY.
WHY, GAYLA?

00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:46,017
YES, CAN I TELL YOU WHY?
(Daymond) YEAH.

00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:49,454
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY CLOTHES
IN THEIR LUXURY RETAIL SPACE

00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:51,990
OVER A SIZE 12.
YES, I‐I UNDERSTAND THAT.

00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:54,526
THAT'S WHY THIS IS
SUCH A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.
(Daymond) YEAH.

00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:57,996
BUT WHY DON'T THEY HAVE THEM?
BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE "LUXURY"
LOOK. WHEN WE ARE‐‐

00:34:57,996 --> 00:35:00,832
(Robert) IS THAT TRUE, DAYMOND?
(Gayla) THAT'S WHY WE'RE TIRED
OF BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST.

00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:03,201
(Robert) I FIND THAT
HARD TO BELIEVE.
NO, IT'S TRUE.

00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:05,604
TO THE WORLD,
LUXURY IS NOT PLUS SIZES.
THIS IS NOT LUXURIOUS?

00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,706
NOT TO THEM,
NOT TO THE WORLD RIGHT NOW.

00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:11,509
WE NEED SOMEONE TO BE A PIONEER,
TO BREAK THROUGH.
I JUST WANT TO ASK THE MOST
IMPORTANT QUESTION,

00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:14,279
WHICH IS, BARBARA‐‐
YOU HAVE TO BE HONEST‐‐

00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:18,650
IS THIS SOME GOOD STUFF?
I HAPPEN TO THINK THE CLOTHING'S
BEAUTIFUL, WITHOUT A DOUBT,

00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:22,220
AND I THINK THE ATTENTION
TO DES‐‐DETAIL, UH,

00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,390
IS USUALLY VERY EXPENSIVE
TO BE DONE.
(Daymond) RIGHT.

00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,926
DAYMOND, IS HER IDEA
TO NOW EXPAND THE LINE

00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:31,363
BY OPENING UP A FLAGSHIP STORE
THE RIGHT STRATEGY?

00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:35,867
IT ALL DEPENDS.
I DON'T KNOW.

00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:38,303
I DO BELIEVE THAT SHE CAN
MAKE A NEW SPACE.

00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:40,305
I MEAN,
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I DID.

00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:43,508
THERE WAS NOT
A YOUNG MEN'S MARKET IN 1990,

00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:46,478
UNTIL WE MADE THAT SO‐CALLED
"URBAN SPACE." SO SHE‐‐
BUT, DAYMOND, HANG ON A SEC.

00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:49,981
IF FASHION IS REALLY ABOUT
THE BRAND, THE DESIGNER,

00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,550
WHY GO AFTER JUST LARGE?

00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:57,088
WHY CAN'T SHE GO AFTER
THE ENTIRE MARKET?
SEE, AND‐‐AND THAT IS
A GOOD POINT, BECAUSE THAT‐‐

00:35:57,088 --> 00:36:00,959
SOME OF THESE PIECES, I THINK,
WOULD BE ATTRACTIVE ON ANYBODY.
WELL, THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.
I LOVE THIS STUFF.

00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:03,628
(Gayla)
THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT.
BUT IT'S A CROWDED FIELD
IF YOU GO OUT THERE

00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:07,332
AND‐‐AND PUT THOSE DESIGNS TO‐‐
BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO BUY
THE LARGE STUFF.

00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,634
EXCUSE ME. I WANT TO MENTION
THAT I DIDN'T MENTION

00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:11,636
IT'S A $30‐BILLION‐A‐YEAR
INDUSTRY,

00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:13,905
AND WOULDN'T YOU LIKE
A PIECE OF THAT PIE?

00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:17,342
GAYLA, YOU'VE DONE A GOOD JOB
OF GETTING TO THIS POINT.
THANK YOU.

00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:20,345
LET'S GO BACK TO THE $250,000
FOR A SECOND, FOR ME.
THANK YOU. OKAY.

00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:22,647
WHY DO YOU NOW WANT
TO TAKE $250,000

00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:24,215
AND OPEN A RETAIL STORE?

00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:27,752
AND AS AN INVESTOR, HOW WOULD
I EVER GET MY MONEY

00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:30,455
OUT OF SINKING IT
INTO ONE RETAIL LOCATION?

00:36:30,455 --> 00:36:32,457
BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA ROLL IT OUT
INTO OTHERS.

00:36:32,457 --> 00:36:35,126
THIS WILL BE THE FIRST ONE,
IN THE SIMON MALLS.

00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:38,730
TH‐THIS IS THE WORST TIME
IN THE HISTORY OF RETAIL‐‐

00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:41,733
BUT LET ME TELL YOU,
SINCE THE FIRST QUARTER,

00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:44,703
THE WHOLESALE WENT DOWN, SO I
HAD TO THINK QUICKLY ON MY FEET,

00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:47,038
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO STOP
MY MOMENTUM.

00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,040
I SAID, "WHY DON'T WE TAKE
THE FRONT PART

00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,243
OF OUR WHOLESALE SHOWROOM
AND TURN IT INTO RETAIL?"

00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:56,214
WE'RE UP 137%, WITH MY AVERAGE
SALE BEING $1,000.
GOOD FOR YOU.

00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:59,350
WHY DO YOU NEED $250,000 FROM ME
TO OPEN UP A RETAIL STORE?

00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:01,653
WHY NOT JUST DO IT
ON YOUR OWN?

00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:03,888
I‐I'VE GONE TO THE BANKS,

00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:07,125
AND THEY'RE NOT IN THE MOOD
TO LEND RIGHT NOW.
I'M SURE THAT'S THE CASE.

00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:10,028
GAYLA, THERE'S SO MANY
DIFFERENT, UM, PRODUCTS HERE,

00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:13,798
AND WHEN I DO AN INFOMERCIAL,
I HAVE ONE PRODUCT...
RIGHT.

00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:15,834
IN 30 MINUTES.
WHEN I SEE ALL THE SIZES,

00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:17,802
AND NOW TO COUPLE THAT
WITH RETAIL,

00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:20,905
IT'S A VERY SCARY BUSINESS
FOR ME, SO I'M GONNA LEAVE THIS

00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,841
TO THE EXPERTS HERE.
BEFORE YOU GO OUT‐‐
BEFORE YOU GO OUT...

00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:25,143
YEAH.
WHICH IS‐‐IS THAT
WHERE YOU WERE GOING?

00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:27,712
I'M GOING OUT, YEAH.
YOU'RE SURE?

00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:30,448
I HAVE TO, YEAH,
BECAUSE IT‐‐IT‐‐
LET ME JUST STOP YOU
A MINUTE. OKAY?

00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:33,451
I'VE BEEN WATCHING QVC.
THERE'S SOME ADORABLE LITTLE GUY

00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:35,453
THAT DEMONSTRATED
HIS CLOTHING EXACTLY LIKE

00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,722
SHE'S DEMONSTRATING, AND HE'S
SELLING OFF THE SHELVES.

00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:40,692
I HAVE, RIGHT NOW, A HOME
SHOPPING NETWORK PURSUING ME.

00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:43,428
I DID NOT WANT TO SIGN
ANY CONTRACTS...
(Barbara) MM‐HMM.

00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,430
UNTIL I CAME TO SEE YOU ALL,

00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,899
'CAUSE I NEED SOMEONE
WITH YOUR WISDOM AND EXPERIENCE

00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:50,435
TO HELP MAKE SURE
I MAKE THE RIGHT DEAL.
AND SHE'S ADORABLE.

00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:53,204
SHE'S GOT THAT INSTANT,
THINKING‐ON‐HER‐FEET CHARM.

00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:56,207
SHE'S GONNA ROMANCE‐‐
I THINK I'D DO GREAT ON THAT.
WE WANT TO DO THE DEAL,

00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:59,210
BUT I DON'T WANT TO DO IT‐‐
MAKE SURE I MAKE THE RIGHT DEAL.
GAYLA, I‐I LOVE THE STORY.

00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,212
I‐I HAVE A HUGE AMOUNT
OF RESPECT

00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:03,414
FOR THE SALES
YOU BUILT IN YOUR BUSINESS.

00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:06,184
BUT BRICKS AND MORTAR
IS THE WRONG STRATEGY.

00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:08,319
I KNOW ENOUGH TO KNOW
THAT'S WRONG.

00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:10,755
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT...

00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:12,590
WITH A HEAVY HEART.

00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:15,660
OKAY, BUT I AM FLEXIBLE,
AND I AM OPEN

00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,596
TO WHAT WE THINK WOULD BE
THE BEST THING TO DO HERE.

00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:21,032
I THINK THE HOME SHOPPING
IS A GOOD WAY TO GO,

00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:23,601
BECAUSE I THINK IT BUILDS
MY GLOBAL BRAND,

00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:26,838
WITH MORE PEOPLE LOOKING‐‐
I GOTTA GET MY NAME OUT THERE.
BUT ALL ROADS LEAD
TO THIS FACT‐‐

00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:29,007
YES OR NO, TRUE OR FALSE‐‐
YOU ARE SHUT OUT OF RETAIL,

00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:32,310
WHERE 90% OF CLOTHES ARE SOLD?
OH, MY GOD.
YOU ARE REALLY RUTHLESS.

00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,445
NO. NO. I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.
YOU ARE REALLY RIGHT.

00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:36,881
THANK YOU.
GAYLA, I CANNOT BE THE PIONEER

00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:39,751
WITH THE ARROWS IN MY BACK,
ALL RIGHT?

00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:41,753
DARLING, IT'S OKAY.
I AM OUT.

00:38:41,753 --> 00:38:44,255
THAT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT.
GAYLA, I WAS GONNA SAY IT
BEFORE,

00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:47,025
BUT I'M GONNA SAY IT NOW‐‐
THANK YOU SO MUCH, BUT I'M OUT.

00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:50,128
YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO
CONSIDER GOING IN HALF, KEVIN?

00:38:50,128 --> 00:38:53,965
I CAN'T IMAGINE YOU CAN'T SELL
THIS STUFF ON THE AIR.
BARBARA, ARE YOU
ON COMMISSION WITH HER?

00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:56,768
I MEAN, I'VE NEVER SEEN
A SHARK WORK SO HARD

00:38:56,768 --> 00:39:00,104
TO BRING
SOMEBODY ELSE BACK IN.
I LOVE THIS LADY, AND YOU'RE NOT
GIVING HER THE CHANCE,

00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:04,242
AND YOU GUYS AREN'T MARRIED
TO HEAVYSET LADIES. THE TRUTH‐‐

00:39:04,242 --> 00:39:08,213
HE'S ON HIS THIRD, FOURTH,
FIFTH‐‐A TROPHY WIFE OR‐‐
WHAT DOES ANY OF THIS
HAVE TO DO WITH MAKING MONEY?

00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:10,181
(Barbara) OKAY, ALL SKINNY.
ALL RIGHT?
SHE'S TALKING ABOUT ME?

00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,917
(Robert) WHAT?
SHE TALKING ABOUT YOU?

00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:15,453
WHAT IS SHE TALKING ABOUT?
YEAH. I'M TRYING
TO PROMPT HIM TO GET IN,

00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:18,456
BECAUSE I THINK YOU SHOULD
JUMP IN ON THIS.
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
DAYMOND'S TROPHY WIFE

00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:20,692
OR KEVIN'S TROPHY WIFE?
(Barbara) THEY ALL HAVE THEM.

00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,694
(O'Leary) WHAT DOES THAT HAVE
TO DO WITH MAKING MONEY?
I GOT TWO PUPPIES.

00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,996
I ONLY GOT TWO PUPPIES. I DON'T
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:27,832
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT LISTENING.
HERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY

00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:30,702
IN AN AREA YOU CAN DO WELL WITH.
OPEN YOUR EARS.

00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:32,770
I'LL PUT IN HALF THE MONEY

00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:35,406
IF YOU CAN GET THIS
CLOTHING KING AND TELL THEM‐‐

00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:39,077
GIVE THEM ONE MORE REASON
TO GO IN WITH YOU.

YOU HAVE A BUILT‐IN CLIENTELE

I JOTTED DOWN SOME NOTES.

00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:38,503
YOU HAVE TO CONVINCE ME
TO FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU,

00:40:38,503 --> 00:40:41,172
AND THEN AFTER THAT...
OH.

00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:45,076
YOU HAVE TO CONVINCE AMERICA
TO FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU.
DON'T LOSE THIS OPPORTUNITY.

00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:48,546
YOU PROMISE THAT
YOU WILL NOT BLOW THIS?
I PROMISE. I PROMISE YOU.

00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:51,215
I PROMISE YOU THAT.
YOU COULDN'T GET A MORE LOYAL,

00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:54,152
HARDWORKING GROUP OF PEOPLE
THAN WE ARE.

00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:57,655
HERE IS‐‐
HERE IS MY PROPOSAL.

00:40:57,655 --> 00:41:02,393
I WOULD... WANT TO GO PARTNERS
WITH YOU IN THE COMPANY,

00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:06,164
SO IT WOULD BE 50%
FOR THE $250,000.

00:41:06,164 --> 00:41:08,399
IT WOULD BE CONTINGENT ON US
GETTING A DEAL

00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:11,169
WITH A WOMEN'S HOUSE,
WHICH ARE MANY OF MY FRIENDS.

00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:13,938
I KNOW BARBARA WANTS TO BE IN.

00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:18,643
I FIND THAT THERE IS NO NEED
FOR BARBARA IN THIS DEAL.

00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:22,714
HOW NICE.
BUT I DO VALUE THE FACT

00:41:22,714 --> 00:41:26,150
THAT I WOULD HAVE A PARTNER
WITH SKIN IN THE GAME

00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,686
THAT DOES KNOW
WOMEN'S FASHIONS.

00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:31,322
AN ELOQUENT FEMALE
LIKE BARBARA

00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,425
CAN TELL ME IT'S CRAP
OR IT'S NOT.
YES.

00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:37,562
BARBARA, ARE YOU IN ON THIS,
SO I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON?
ABSOLUTELY.

00:41:37,562 --> 00:41:40,365
OKAY, LET'S DISCUSS THIS.

00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:42,800
I WANT TO REMAIN
IN CREATIVE CONTROL,

00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,337
BECAUSE I KNOW AND BELIEVE
WHAT THE WOMEN WANT.

00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:49,440
AND CAN WE LOOK AT 45%?

00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,942
KEEP IN MIND

00:41:50,942 --> 00:41:53,544
THAT NORMALLY I ASK FOR 51%,

00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:56,347
SO THE REASON
WHY I'M ASKING FOR 50%

00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,484
IS SO YOU HAVE
CREATIVE CONTROL,

00:41:59,484 --> 00:42:02,286
WE MAKE THESE DECISIONS
TOGETHER.

00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:05,356
THAT IS WHY
I DID NOT MAKE IT 51%.

00:42:07,492 --> 00:42:09,360
WE HAVE A DEAL.

00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,397
GOOD.
OH, MY GOD!
YOU'RE FANTASTIC!

00:42:12,397 --> 00:42:15,433
MWAH. MWAH.
MWAH. MWAH. MWAH.
NOW YOU CAN DO AS MUCH TOUCHING
AS YOU WANT

00:42:15,433 --> 00:42:19,370
'CAUSE WE'RE PARTNERS.
DARLING, MWAH! OH, BARBARA,
THIS IS SO EXCITING.

00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,606
(Daymond) OH,
THEY'RE CRYING ABOUT‐‐

00:42:21,606 --> 00:42:24,409
