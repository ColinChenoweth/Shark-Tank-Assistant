00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:54,127
You spent all day building
a masterpiece.

00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:56,796
That's why I invented Le‐Glue,

00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:59,732
the world's first
non‐permanent adhesive

00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,134
that just dissolves in water.

00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:04,871
Plus it's non‐toxic
and safe for kids.

00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:09,175
After all, Le‐Glue is created
for kids by a kid.

00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:10,543
[ Greiner chuckles ]

00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:13,079
To use Le‐Glue, just apply
a little bit to each brick,

00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:16,949
let it sit...

00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,251
and you're good to go.

00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,787
So the next time this happens...

00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:24,056
...you just pick it
right on up...

00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,992
[ Laughter ]

00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:27,827
...and keep on playing.

00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:29,796
And the best part ‐‐

00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:31,697
just soak them in water,
and they come apart

00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:32,932
like brand‐new again.

00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,736
So, Sharks,
who wants to <i>stick</i> with me

00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:41,407
and help me stop those messy
breakups with Le‐Glue?

00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,009
[ Greiner chuckles ]
Alright.

00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:44,510
Good job.

00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,246
We have some samples
and some homemade sharks

00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:48,881
that the kids
have made for you.

00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:50,850
‐[ Chuckles ]
‐Thank you, Tripp.

00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,218
‐Thank you, Allee.
‐Oh, I like.

00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:54,187
I got a great white.

00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:55,855
Nice dress.
Thank you.

00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:58,357
We got you the whale shark
to match your ego.

00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:59,692
Thank you.
[ Laughter ]

00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:00,993
Nice.
Thank you, Tripp.

00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:03,329
You're very wise.
Ba‐bam!

00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:06,732
‐Good job, Tripp.
‐Thank you.

00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,201
Thank you.

00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:10,169
So, Tripp, I see you
have a patent there.

00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,337
‐Yes, sir.
‐Oh, wow.

00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,605
What did you patent on this?

00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:14,707
Tripp: We have
a utility patent,

00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:17,877
and my patent attorney told me
that I was one

00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:20,580
of the youngest patent holders
in U. S. history.

00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,481
‐Really?
‐Good for you.

00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,782
‐How old are you?
‐12.

00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:25,184
12.
That's pretty amazing.

00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:27,186
I got the patent
when I was 10.

00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,322
How did you figure this out,
Tripp?

00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,557
In the third grade
as a class assignment,

00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,926
I had the option
to write a paper

00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,963
or come up with an invention,
and I think I chose

00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:39,398
to do what any other logical
9‐year‐old would do ‐‐

00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,734
avoided the writing.
[ Chuckling ]

00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,070
So I went home and asked my dad,

00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,039
"How in the world do I come up
with an invention?!"

00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,774
He said it was simple ‐‐

00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:53,279
just identify a problem and then
find a solution to fix it.

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,747
So, that's exactly
what I did.

00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:55,882
Spot‐on.

00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:58,184
As I was in my room,
playing with my airplane

00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,753
and thinking about,
"What could I do?"

00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:03,189
the wing would pop off
whenever I'd do a takeoff.

00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,191
Then I knew what I should do.

00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:08,194
I need something to hold
these bricks together

00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:11,297
but not permanently
like superglue does.

00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:13,366
Siminoff: So, Tripp,
as the only Shark who's been

00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,434
on your side of the table,
I have to say,

00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:17,436
great job with
your presentation.

00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:21,240
Also, as someone who still has a
child that's in this age range,

00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,442
I have to say this
is a real problem.

00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,511
My feet, I think, have permanent
marks in them

00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:28,214
from stepping on bricks,
so this Le‐Glu‐‐ Glue

00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:29,482
could be a real lifesaver.

00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,017
But tell me about the business.

00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:33,786
Last year,
we sold $52,000...

00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:35,488
‐Wow!
‐Good for you.

00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:38,057
...and this year,
up until the end of May,

00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,593
we've sold $32,000,

00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:45,498
and in our whole lifetime,
we've sold just over $125,000.

00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:46,599
Good for you.

00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,067
‐How are you selling it, Tripp?
‐Wow.

00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,636
Mostly online
on our own website.

00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:51,737
What do you sell it for?

00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,906
How much does it cost
to make a package?

00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:57,443
It costs 43 cents with direct
labor, but don't tell anybody.

00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:58,644
‐[ Chuckles ]
‐But what do you sell it for?

00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,813
‐What do you sell it for?
‐We sell it for $8.99.

00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,548
‐That's a great margin.
‐Oh.
‐Good margins.

00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:03,983
Tripp, why'd you decide to

00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:05,217
create a business
out of this, though?

00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,053
I mean, you could've
just aced the project,

00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:08,454
right,
and got a good grade.

00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:11,991
Even from a small age, I've
always watched "Shark Tank,"

00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:14,760
and as soon as I actually
had a business,

00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,929
one of the first things ‐‐
probably even the first thing ‐‐

00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,832
I asked my dad was, "We have
to go on 'Shark Tank'."

00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,033
‐[ Chuckling ]
‐That is good.

00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,668
So, now I'm pretty much
living my dream.

00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,704
‐Oh, that's so great.
‐Oh, good.

00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:26,906
O'Leary: What is your vision in
terms of getting distribution?

00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:29,075
You gonna leave it online, or do
you want to get it into retail

00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:31,877
where building blocks
are sold?

00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,746
His personal goal
is to partner

00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:36,015
with one of the brick
manufacturers at some point

00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:37,717
to be in every
one of the kits.

00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,952
Tell you what,
I'm interested in the idea

00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,921
of approaching
the big block guys.

00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:43,623
I know
all the toy companies.

00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,825
I want to help do something
that you're not doing,

00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:47,293
which is get
a license deal.

00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:50,029
So, I'd make
a contingency on it.

00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,764
I'll give you the $80,000.

00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:54,400
I'll go make those
calls for you,

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,801
but you're gonna
have to come with me

00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,269
to pitch it to the CEO.

00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:58,337
Now, you're gonna have to
put on

00:18:58,337 --> 00:18:59,972
a black suit and tie,
just like me.

00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,108
[ Laughter ]
A tie pin and everything.

00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:03,109
That's how
it's gonna work.

00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:04,310
You'll look like
a little undertaker.

00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,678
Well, I have hair, so...

Whatever I get on the royalty
deal for all of us,

00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:17,223
we're gonna go 50/50
until I get my 80K back,

00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:19,291
'cause it's gonna be
a tremendous amount of work.

00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,961
Then it's gonna
drop down to 20%,

00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:23,896
and we're gonna have
a partnership in perpetuity

00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,532
where I'm a 20% shareholder
of the company.

00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:30,102
If I don't deliver the big guy,
then I don't have any stake.

00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,405
We go together, we find out
if they're gonna do it,

00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:34,807
they say yes,
we're in business.

00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:35,975
Greiner: Wow.

00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:37,843
Siminoff: Tripp, Allee,
I think you guys have done

00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,178
an amazing job with this.

00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,647
It's ‐‐ It is solving
a real problem.

on this one,
and I think it's a ‐‐

00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:47,920
it's a great way to do it.

So, because of that,
I'm out.

00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,625
Thank you for your time.

John: You know what?
I like this.

00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,662
I think the licensing route
is great.

00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,130
I think that
we should try that.

00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,299
I don't know
as many of the toy companies.

00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,468
However, I know
the adhesive giant, 3M.

00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:04,970
They're doing $30 billion
a year in ‐‐ in adhesives.

00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:08,340
So, I'm gonna offer you $80,000
for 25%.

Well, listen, Tripp.

00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,714
You have two great offers
on the table

00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:18,451
where I think either way,
you really can't lose.

00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:22,154
So, I'm going out,
but congratulations.

00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:23,255
Thank you so much.

I think you have two great
offers on the table

that would be better
than what I can do.

00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:31,864
So, for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:33,999
So, Tripp, you have to
make a decision.

00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:38,704
Uh, Daymond, we would like
to make a counteroffer.

00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:42,141
Uh, the $80,000 for 20%.

00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,545
I would like to
stick at the 25%.

00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:51,417
I would ‐‐ I would
normally ask 33%.

00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:54,220
Are you planning to take him
to retail, as well?

00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,256
Well, I'm planning to do
whatever you feel is best.
Or licensing. Okay.

00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,824
Retail may or may not
be in your cards,

00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:01,293
but that's something you guys
will decide after you,

00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,796
you know, decide where
you want to go with it.

00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:05,431
And, Mr. O'Leary,
the $80,000 ‐‐

00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,266
When you're saying, "If you
can't make the deal..."

00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,602
But I don't get any of your
company unless I deliver

00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:12,538
the license deal at ‐‐
one that you want to do.

00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:15,708
I'll be taking the same
toy guys, as well.

00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,043
Greiner: The real difference
is contingency

00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:19,044
‐on it happening and not.
‐Well, also...

00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:20,346
It's ‐‐ It's success‐based,
though.

00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:21,714
It's not a ‐‐
It's not a contingency.

00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:22,882
It is. It is.
I don't get anything
if I don't deliver.

00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:25,017
But the thing is, with Daymond,
it's firm.

00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:27,553
But why give up
25% of your company

00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:29,054
if you don't deliver
the whale shark?

00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:30,322
That's what I say.

00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,894
You decide.

00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:36,328
Tell me what you want.

00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:39,999
Okay.

00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:45,704
Mr. O'Leary,
we'd like to do business.

00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:46,906
‐Oh.
‐That's great.
‐Alright, Tripp.

00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:48,741
‐Oh, my gosh.
‐Congratulations, guys.

00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:51,210
Congratulations. You did really
well on the Tank, you know?

00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,478
You got two offers.
That's pretty good.

00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,313

Not easy to
get that done.
