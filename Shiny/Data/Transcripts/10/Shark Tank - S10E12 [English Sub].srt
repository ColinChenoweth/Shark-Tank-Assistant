So, little babies,
around 5 months,

00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,536
if you put the ball in the hole,
they're not gonna look for it.

00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:47,072
They don't understand that
that ball is still there.

00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,741
Around 7, 8 months,
they start learning,

00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,177
"It's gone, but I can look
for it and find it."

00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:55,347
Are you interviewing

and asking what they like?

00:31:56,815 --> 00:31:59,351
So, this is based

00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:43,995
And the school where I was
working started at age 3,

like most preschools
around the world.

00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:48,400
And, given my background,
I know that 0 to 3,

00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,035

‐For those two shelves of toys?
‐Three months.

‐Do you send it back after that?
‐You do not,

00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:10,455
because your child
is not gonna stop using this

00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:11,556

They're gonna use it ‐‐

00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:13,425

Yes.

00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,530
And the content, which is
actually the most valuable part

00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:21,032

What does it cost you to make
all this stuff and send them?

00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:23,835
