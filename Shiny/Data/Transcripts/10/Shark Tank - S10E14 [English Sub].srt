Ooh.

We know you need it.

All right.
And for Alli,

we got you
our Drybar yellow

Thanks, Tim.
Enjoy.

00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:32,538
Herjavec: It's for people
with curly hair.
Yes.

00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,073
Not to straighten it?
Correct.

00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:35,475
Just to make it more curly?

00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:36,976
To define their curls.
Absolutely.

00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,978
However your hair looks
when it's wet and curly.

00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:42,415
So, what would the hair look
like before and after?

00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,584
So, this is their before.
Which side?

‐You can't tell?
‐Right‐hand side.

00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:49,922
So you'll see that
it's not really well‐defined.

And it looks ‐‐
How does it look different?

00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:53,126

How does it look different?

is, like,
a more defined curl.

Like, you can actually
see the spiral?

‐Yes.
‐Absolutely.

Hello. Drybar.
Yes. There is a problem.
[ Both laugh ]

00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,092
There is a huge market for women
who want their natural curls.

00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:29,095
I have naturally curly hair,
too, but not this curly.
So do I.

00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,831
Did.
And if you want to go
with your natural curls,

00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:34,567
you need something that makes
your hair look like pretty ‐‐

00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,669
And so, what's the big deal
about flaxseed oil?

00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,305
If you look online,
you'll find thousands of women

00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,907
making their own
flaxseed gel at home.

00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:42,208
Tim: If you're making it
at home,

00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,976
it's ridiculously tough
to preserve.

00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:45,945
It lasts two or three days
unless you freeze it.

00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,916
And so we developed a method
to make flaxseed gel at scale.

00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,018
We launched it in
a couple test batches.

00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:53,953
We sold out
almost instantly,

00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,721

after she gave birth.

nine months.

We first got into the industry
five years ago.

We were
fresh out of college.

My wife hated her job,
so then she's a hustler.

And I was
a business major,

so I majored in Marketing
and Supply Chain Management.
Yes.

00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:16,976
And so she wanted to pursue
entrepreneurship.

00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,611
We didn't have the money
at the time,

00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,947

of the year.

what it costs.

What does it sell for?
About $25.

The lowest bottle
is $25 to $28.

And what does it cost you
to make it?

So, it costs about $3 to make
a regular bottle of gel.

00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:58,584

you make it for $3.

because the margins are crazy,

for that.

‐Yeah.
‐Mm‐hmm.

00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,178
It's brutally competitive,

00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,047
and you need that margin

00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:03,549
to buy the brand
and the marketing.

00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:06,085
Are you gonna need
a massive push

00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,154
in the market
to buy brand?
Mm‐hmm.

00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:10,957
Well, not only that. You need
massive infrastructure, too.

00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:12,858
Right.
Because I know personally
how hard it is

00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,193
to start a product line.

00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:15,928
Now we have, like,
a team of, like,

I don't know,
30 people,

00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:19,966
that if you really want
to compete with the big guys...
Yeah.

00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:22,034
...the DevaCurls of the world,
like, you have to put

a lot of infrastructure
in place,

‐Yeah, see, I ‐‐ I ‐‐

This is one of the few
investments that I think,

00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:30,042
if I give you $400,000,
you're definitely gonna grow

00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,277
and you're gonna
get bigger.
Mm‐hmm.

00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,678
What I worry about is,

00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:34,780
the car goes faster
and then hits a wall.

00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,715
‐Yeah.
‐Mm.

00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,617
And so,
for those other brands,

00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,719
a lot of them think
retail first,

00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,020
and that's not
our strategy.

00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,421
Our strategy is
to stay online right now

00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:43,422
because our margins
are so big.

00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:44,590
Well, you don't have
any other choice

00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,325
because you're not gonna get
any retail space.

00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:47,927
That's a point.
The problem with
high‐margin products

00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:49,895
is the guys
that own that space

00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:52,298
protect it
as if they're warriors.

00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,233
Mm‐hmm.

one single inch.

00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:06,178
There's nothing proprietary
about taking flaxseed

00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,114
and boiling it,
so if this works

00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:10,282
and you get to
$50 million in sales,

00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,284
some guy that's doing
$2 billion is gonna say,

00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,654
"Okay, boil some flaxseed.

cockroaches."

extra money by then.

of it, and we thought,

00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:41,033

to Austin

called the Troodos Mountains,

Like, where do you
keep the goats?

00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:41,560
We do. Well, we started at
the top of the parking garage

00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,428

in downtown Austin.

that we bring in to the
other retailers in the area,

00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:54,306

Absolutely.

So, we're already going into
now what we call phase 2.

We're gonna do full‐time yoga
90% of the time,

and then we'll do the Goat Yoga
still every other weekend.

Is it a different price

typically from $20 to $25.

is $30 a person.

We also do a lot
of private events,

so for those, we charge
$40 a person.

00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:32,377

It is
somewhat of a novelty.

00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:39,017

but a lot of those people

who come have never
done yoga before,

00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:42,554

introduction to them.

It's getting them
in the door.

What makes
your business different

So, one thing is

00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,792
our partnership
with Trey's mom, Roxie,

00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:23,262
who gives us a constant supply
of baby goats.

00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,197
The best goats.
A lot of people are doing it
with large goats,

00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:27,733
so you've got a 100‐pound goat
on your back with big horns.
They are.

00:29:27,733 --> 00:29:29,868
We only use goats
that are this size.
That sounds scary.

00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:31,436
Trey: We use only baby goats.
I definitely don't want
a goat with horns.

00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,704

studio about a year ago.

The minute you get

00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:43,882
your rent goes up,
you have fixed costs.

00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:46,918
You've got to start
cycling more classes.

00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:48,954
It feels a little gimmicky
to me,

00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:51,056
because, really,
it's a yoga studio

00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:53,091
that every now and then
has a goat.

00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:55,027

to your scaling ‐‐

00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:00,699
a lot of the other Goat Yogas
are not doing it near,

00:30:00,699 --> 00:30:02,467
like,

00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,635
We're bringing the goats
into downtown ‐‐

00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,003
But that's not even really
the issue, right?

00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:08,307
It's not like 80% of yoga,
uh, practitioners

00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:10,509
are going to start doing
Goat Yoga.

00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:12,678
I would suggest you keep it
on the rooftop,

00:30:12,678 --> 00:30:14,680
because you can start
building your yoga studio

00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,381
and then
maybe integrate in.

00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:17,649
But it's a niche market,

00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,485
and while you might be able
to open more than one,

00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,388
it ‐‐ then you're just
a yoga studio that
happens to have one angle,

00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:25,324
and I don't see it as
an investable business,

00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,092
so for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:29,628
‐Okay.
‐I love this idea.

00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:32,964
It's different and inventive,
but, for me, with Drybar,

00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:34,900
I've been a professional
hairstylist for 20 years,

00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,169
and I feel like that gave me
a very unique position

00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:38,837
because we have
a ton of copycats

00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,205
and a ton of competition.

00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:42,074
A lot of those ‐‐
those entrepreneurs

00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:44,242
aren't hairstylists,
so they don't understand

00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:45,677
the way the hair business
works.

00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,246
Yeah.
So what makes me nervous
is the fact that, like,

00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:50,048
you're not a yoga instructor.

00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:52,684
A lot of girls I know
take yoga very seriously,

00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:56,021

bikers, music festivals.

00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:44,456
So, who wants to
get naked in public

00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:46,391
with the Shower Toga?

00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:49,127
The Dirty Fairy
is super pumped

00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:51,363
about handing samples
out to you guys.

00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,398
Thank you.
I want to go
do mud racing now.

00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:54,666
I didn't know
that was a thing.

00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:56,935
‐Thank you.
‐Thank you, thank you.

00:33:56,935 --> 00:33:58,370
Thank you, Mr. Fairy.

00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,872
Okay, so now,
as you can see,

00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,275
Layla and Conner are fresh
and clean, but, hey,

00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:05,377
Conner's going to pick up
a hot date.

00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:06,578
Do you really think
he wants

00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:08,480
all of his muddy crap
in his car?

00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,982
No.
She's gonna think
he's a slob, right?

00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:15,687
Not now, because his Shower Toga
acts as a duffel bag.

00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:17,122
That's such a good idea!
‐So...

00:34:17,122 --> 00:34:18,957
‐That is a good idea.
‐Yes!

00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:20,458
Is it a good idea?
Have you sold any?

00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:21,960
Yes,
it's a great idea, Mom.

00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,395
I have! I have.

00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:26,097
I've sold $80,000 worth.
That's not bad.
How ‐‐ What ‐‐

00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:27,632
‐How long a period of time?
‐Yeah, how long?

00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:30,769
Um, I ‐‐
really, since November.

00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:32,470
Where and how
did you sell that?

00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,873
We ‐‐ Like I said,
we do obstacle‐course races

00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:36,041
all over the world.

00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:37,409
So you took these to
obstacle‐course races?

00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,578
I did.
I started selling them

00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:42,147
from our rolling‐cart
bucket thing.
Okay.

00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:43,715
What did you do
before this?

00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:45,584
I ‐‐
It's kind of a strange ‐‐

00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,619
I've always been
an entrepreneur.

00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:49,854
We used ‐‐
We wouldn't expect anything
strange from you guys.

00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:51,222
Never.
No.

00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:54,392
We do strange. We own that
Hula‐Hoop space of strange.

00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:55,860
I love that space.

00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,696
Um, we've always been
entrepreneurs.

00:34:57,696 --> 00:35:00,365
We actually had a home‐building
business in Atlanta,

00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:02,667
and the market tanked.

00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:06,338
Um, I used to show horses,
and so, for the last 10 years,

00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:08,940
I've been a broker
for high‐end sport horses.

00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,141
What are you
selling it for?

00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:13,378
My retail price is $34.95.

00:35:13,378 --> 00:35:15,814
That's all?
My wholesale is $16.

00:35:15,814 --> 00:35:17,482
And what does it cost you
to make one?

00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:18,783
$2.85.

00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,019
‐Yeah, baby!
‐Whoa!
‐I love the margin!

00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:22,621
Greiner: So, you figured this
whole thing out yourself.

00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:25,023
Oh, boy, did I.
Yes, I don't sleep.

00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:27,325
How did you do that?
Kressa, isn't your competition
a garbage bag?

00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:30,095
Herjavec: Kevin.
Oh, my gosh. That's like
saying that a balloon

00:35:30,095 --> 00:35:31,763
is the same thing
as a condom.

00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:33,765
[ Laughter ]
Yeah, but if you ‐‐
if you go ‐‐

00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:36,001
Why doesn't a garbage bag
do the same thing?

00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:38,670
First of all, a garbage bag ‐‐
you could step into it.

00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,438
It's gonna tear.
You need space for your ‐‐

00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:42,240
Not the ones
that hold leaves.

00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,608
They're, like, a buck,
2 bucks each.

00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:44,609
No. I'm gonna
answer your question.

00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:46,344
Well, they use garbage bags
at concerts.

00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:48,380
I go to them.
People wear them.
Let her answer.

00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:52,217
First of all, the ‐‐ the side
openings on the Shower Toga

00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:55,086
have also what's called
a welt pocket, okay,

00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:56,888
and the reason for this
is because

00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:59,824
if you just have slits on
the side, you're gapping.

00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,861
You gap and bend over...
And you can see stuff!

00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:04,129
Right, yes.

00:36:04,129 --> 00:36:06,097
Thousands more people are using
garbage bags than this.

00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,966
Kevin, to your point,
a garbage bag's gonna leak.

00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:09,634
And in ‐‐ Exactly!
The water's gonna
pour into it.

00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:11,636
You're gonna get
completely wet.
No, it doesn't.

00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:13,638
Well, yes, 'cause the
drawstring's not gonna stay dry.

00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,173
Webb: But the other thing is,
did you notice?

00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,342
I feel like men can do it
and wrap it around their waist

00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:18,777
and pull their pants down
easily, but girls ‐‐

00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:20,178
Like, she had, like,
a sports bra on.

00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,680
Right. And so,
here's the top here.
O'Leary: I just ‐‐

00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,114
Look, I don't want
to take any air

00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:24,616
out of the
Shower Toga balloon,

00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:27,852
but it works the same way,
costs 2 bucks.

00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,388
Is your idea that the races
would sell them

00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:31,723
or give them out?
Yes.

00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:34,793
We actually just got
a PO from one of the largest ‐‐

00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:36,528
the fastest‐growing
race companies.

00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:37,929
How many did they order?
How big was the order?

00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:39,898
Uh, 1,000 units.

00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:43,468
So, have you sold it to
any s‐‐ anybody besides
surfers or racers?

00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:46,204
I actually had somebody
that e‐mailed me.

00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:49,174
She was a caregiver
for the elderly,

00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:50,709
and she bought it...
Yeah.

00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:53,745
...because her patients
didn't want

00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:55,947
to get undressed
in front of her.
O'Leary: Oh.

00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:58,183
Granny in a plastic bag?
Retirement community.

00:36:58,183 --> 00:37:00,185
You're still on
the plastic‐bag thing.
It's more dignity.

00:37:00,185 --> 00:37:01,319
‐Yeah.
‐It's not a plastic bag.

00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:02,787
O'Leary:
I love your energy.

00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:04,422
You ‐‐ You are
really aggressive.

00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:05,557
It's fantastic.
Yeah, you are amazing.

00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:06,825
But I don't like to invest
in products

00:37:06,825 --> 00:37:08,026
where the competition's
a garbage bag

00:37:08,026 --> 00:37:10,128
that costs 99 cents, okay?
[ Laughter ]

00:37:10,128 --> 00:37:11,696
So, that's not exciting
for me. So, look.

00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:13,298
You do a garbage bag.

00:37:13,298 --> 00:37:14,933
I wish you the best, but there's
no way I'm doing this deal.

00:37:14,933 --> 00:37:16,201
I'm out.

Cuban: Kressa,

00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:29,147
have you tried
to sell online at all?

00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:31,516
We ‐‐ I mean, we sell
a lot through our website.

00:37:31,516 --> 00:37:35,220
But your website we ‐‐
But our Amazon
just started recently.

00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,522
And it's tougher, isn't it?
It is a lot tougher, yeah.

00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:39,891
I quit my job in April.

00:37:39,891 --> 00:37:43,561
I bought a truck,
and we rented out our house,

00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:45,430
took them
to obstacle‐course races,

00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,565
and we sell them
from our fifth wheel.

00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:48,633
What's a fifth wheel?

00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:49,968
It's like
a big huge trailer,

00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:51,402
and we live
in the fifth wheel.

00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:53,438
Greiner: So, then
you travel around...
Yeah.

00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,740
In the trailer.
...and you go from
show to show to show...

00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,075
Right. Exactly.
...and that's your life.

00:37:57,075 --> 00:37:59,244
You are so passionate
about this.
Yes.

00:37:59,244 --> 00:38:02,447

mean to you personally?

[ Sniffles ]

[ Voice breaking ]
Five years ago,

00:38:11,823 --> 00:38:14,259
I, um, got breast cancer
[sniffles]

00:38:14,259 --> 00:38:18,129
and I just needed
something to, like,

00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:21,399
bury myself into
that made me not think,

00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:23,968
'cause I think all the time.
It's just all I do.

00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,503
I didn't plan on ‐‐

00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:27,539
I imported horses,
for crying out loud.

00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:29,240
Like, a retail product?

so organically,

and it's actually helped
a ton of people,

like, it saved the world.

That's not my point.

when you're done doing

whatever it is you're doing,
you can go to dinner.

There is a part to this
that I haven't gone into

that I really want to do,
and that is disaster relief,

the actual disaster.
