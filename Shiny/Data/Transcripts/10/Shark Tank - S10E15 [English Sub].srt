00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:45,058
We add 7 to 10 toys
a week,

00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:47,060
and then we are
always monitoring

00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,261
what kids
are playing with,

00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,797
and we adjust what we add
based off of that.

00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:52,432

is that it gets, you know,

used a couple times
and then put away.

on our website.

We just started selling
in September.

00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:08,081
We've done over $300,000
in sales since then,

00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:10,283

is advertise on Facebook.

Cuban: And what does it
cost you to make?

00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,555

we sell it for $299,

00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:16,889

on the market

00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:19,425

and hardware stack

00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:21,661

for children.

00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:24,630
Our biggest target demographic
is 6 to 9‐year‐olds.

00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,834
And you can print toys
from famous media

00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:30,103

Minecraft, Marvel,

00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:31,971

How long did it take
to print this out?
And how many passes?

00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,887

about four hours,

00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,522
maybe about
eight passes.

00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:52,024
You see,
there's the problem.

00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:54,494
The attention span of
a 6, 7, 8, or 9‐year‐old

00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:55,828
is gonna be difficult,

00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:57,296

has that attention span,

00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,467
no matter how much
is in those accounts.

00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:13,973
So, Sharks, if you want to truly
transform kids' futures,

00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:17,710
join me in getting them
signed up

00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,713
to save with Goalsetter.

00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:23,315
So, Tanya, instead of
giving a toy to a child

00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:24,517
when they open the gift ‐‐

00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:25,651
their eyes light up

00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,286
when they've got
a new basketball,

00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,188
football, game, toy ‐‐

00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:32,057
they get a certificate
with, like,

00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:35,094
a $30 "go deposit this
into your account"?

00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:37,196
Like, that ‐‐
that's just...

00:21:37,196 --> 00:21:38,531
That's like a dream gift
for your kids.

00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:40,399
‐That's pretty depressing.
‐[ Laughs ]

00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:42,735
Well, it's actually
not depressing, Kevin,

00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:44,603
because, you know,
you have kids.

00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:47,106
You've seen how much stuff
kids already have.

00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:48,140
Cuban: Okay, so, wait,
wait, wait.

00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,675
Tanya, the bigger question
I have ‐‐

00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:53,412
trying to create bank accounts
for kids is a disaster,

00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:55,681
so tell us how you get
FDIC accounts set up

00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:56,816
and how ‐‐ how it all works,

00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:57,850
And then, of course,

00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,852
we still need to hear
about your business.

00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:02,721
So, you're right. Setting up
a savings account for kids

00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,857
is absolutely
a nightmare,

00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:06,826
which is why this is
such a great opportunity.

00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,861
We set up
an FDIC‐insured account

00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:11,163
for the parent ‐‐
in the parent's name ‐‐

00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,699
and then the parent
can easily add their kids.

00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:16,435
We've just recently been
accepted into an accelerator

00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:19,738
with one of the three major
consumer banks in the country.

00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:22,107
But then don't fees
become a significant issue?

00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:24,076
No, fees aren't
a significant issue

00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:26,212
because our ACH
transaction fees

00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:29,114
are only 5 cents
every time we make a transfer,

00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,750
So, gift‐giving is only one part
of our business, right?

00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,687
But a second way kids get money
is by parents who say,

00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,355
"I want to help you
save for this goal."

00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,524
So, we have
the ability for parents

00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:39,859
to set up auto‐save

00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,894
so they can save a little bit
every week or every month

00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:43,829
to help kids
with big goals over time.

00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,197
Those could be ‐‐
‐It's like a piggy bank.

00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,766
That's right, but it could be
college, or it could be,

00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:49,635
"My kid wants to go to this
really awesome robotics camp,

00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:51,270
but it's really expensive."

00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,872
O'Leary:
How do you make money?

00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,273
So, on the gift‐giving site,

00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:57,009
we charge a dollar
for every GoalCard given,

00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:58,744
minus the transaction fees,

00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,412
which, as we talked about,
are 5 cents,

00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:02,348
and the ACH
transaction fees.

00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:03,649
The second way
that we make money

00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:05,384
is with parents signing up

00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,419
for any of
our savings features.

00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:08,854
What do you
charge for that?

00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:10,823
So, we have
historically charged

00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:13,592
a dollar per month
per kid for that.

00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:15,294
The third way is by taking

00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:16,662
a percentage of assets
under management.

00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:17,897
What's that part?

00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,999
‐[ Laughs ]
‐Kevin!

00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:21,634
‐Easy, easy.
‐That's what I ‐‐

00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:23,335
‐I'm speaking your language.
‐No, no.

00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:24,570
That's what
I know how to do.

00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,606
Okay, so,
our partner bank,

00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:30,643
which holds our assets,
will give us a percentage back

00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:33,345
of those assets
under management.
How many basis points
are they gonna give you?

00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:35,381
‐100 basis points.
‐What?

00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:36,315
‐Yeah.
‐Are you serious?

00:23:36,315 --> 00:23:37,283
Yeah.
That's a lot of money.

00:23:37,283 --> 00:23:39,685
That's a ton.
‐Right, 1%.

00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:42,354
‐Now you've excited him.
‐Whoo‐hoo!

00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:44,990
I've never seen Kevin
breathe so hard.
Kevin's
hyperventilating here.

00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,127
That is more than the entire
industry of services

00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:51,263
in mutual funds,
in exchange‐traded funds,

00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,933
in management fees
for people,

00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:56,635
at brokerage houses,
online.

00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:58,404
That's the highest fee
right now going.

00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:00,806
How long
has this been ‐‐

00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:02,942
that you've been public
with this for, or selling?

00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:06,312
Van Court:
So, we've been selling since
about January of this year,

00:24:06,312 --> 00:24:09,748
and we have about $40,000
under management right now.

00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:11,617
How much money have you raised
to get to this point?

00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:14,086
We've raised
$2.1 million.

00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:16,355
I think it's very cool.
I have a similar thing.

00:24:16,355 --> 00:24:17,690
It's basically charitable,

00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,492
but I help kids invest
a fractional share ownership

00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:22,027
in a product
called Beanstox.

00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:24,997
You download the app,
and you buy 15 cents of Apple.

00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:26,131
You actually own it.
Yep. Absolutely.

00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:29,368
But the biggest problem
is customer acquisition.

00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:30,636
So, our cost per acquisition

00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:33,172
is about $10 per customer
right now,

00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:34,573
But the interesting thing is

00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:38,544
because of the Equifax
data breach over the past year

00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:41,013
and all the security issues
that people have,

00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:44,183
people are concerned about
connecting their bank accounts.

00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:47,286
And so they need us
to be a known quantity

00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:49,021
that they can feel good about
in order to do that.

00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:50,489
Won't the new bank
help you with that

00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,325
because of their brand?
‐Exactly. Kevin, I love you!

00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,760
‐Everybody loves me.
‐[ Laughs ]

00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,663
Tanya, I like your mission.
I like what you're doing.

00:24:57,663 --> 00:25:00,099
I think it makes sense
in a lot of ways.

00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:02,134
I think you're on your way
to getting there,

00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:03,969
but I don't think
you're there yet,

00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:05,804
and so for that reason,
I'm out.

00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,306
No!

00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:09,108
So, Tanya,
I love what you're doing.

00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:10,909
The problem is,

00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:14,680
it's so outside of what I do,
in terms of physical product.

00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,981
I'm sorry. I'm out.

00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:18,117
Jamie, are you sure?

00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:22,187
Maybe Amazon can sign up
to give all of its employees...

00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,723

make that happen.
...as an employee benefit,

John: Well, here's what
I think about it.

00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:31,697
You know, Minka,
my daughter, she's 2 1/2.

00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,032
She doesn't
give anybody a hug

00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,833
unless they have
a gift with them,

00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,803
and for her
to open an e‐mail,

00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:39,872
she probably just would
be like, "W‐What is this?"

00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:43,909
[ Laughter ]
So, um...

00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:46,278
I love the fact that you're
teaching financial intelligence,

00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:47,546
but I just don't think
this one's for me.

00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:48,580
I'm out.

00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,416
Okay, well,
thank you, Daymond.

00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:54,119
But what we have seen
when we have done testing,

00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,921
for the younger kids,
they have so much stuff

00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:57,723
that Mom is tired of
answering the calls like,

00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,725
"What should I get Minka?"
‐Yeah, look,

00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:03,295
aspirationally and goal‐wise,
it makes perfect sense, right?

00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:05,064
Right?
You know, Tanya,
if you just said,

00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:07,966
"Look, it's hard to open up
a bank account for your kids."

00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:10,035
"Do it here." Yeah.

00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:11,203
'Cause then you'd have
no overhead.

00:26:11,203 --> 00:26:12,304
That's
an easy business.

00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:14,506
You've complicated this
to no end.

00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:15,974
I actually
don't think, Mark,

00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:17,276
that this is
complicated to no end.

00:26:17,276 --> 00:26:18,710
I think it's actually
super simple,

and what we've heard
from parents ‐‐
Wait, wait, look.

to accomplish, but I'm out.

I'll make you an offer,
but it's gonna be aggressive,

because I actually
know what the work's like,

00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:42,634

a lot of value by just
