the biggest difference

between
the old days and today ‐‐

00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,190

that people look at

as far as
you want to go with it.

00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,333
And on top of that,

00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,634
we build our centers to be

00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,536
very kind of high‐end,
more spa‐like.

00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:52,039
Does each person get
a new salt bag

00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:54,808
or is it the same salt bag
the last guy rotated in?

00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:57,077
So, what we do is,
the entire body of water

00:02:57,077 --> 00:03:00,747
goes through a filtration system
no less than four times

00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:03,150
where it's heated,
treated, hit with UV,

00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,785
it's sanitized,
and then back in.

00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:07,254

on our door and said,

"Hey, we really want
to do this."

00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,653

came back last month

00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:41,054
and bought four more, uh,

00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,023
with the profits
from her first store.

00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,191

come from?

real bootstrap,

00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,236
and, uh, we did that
with friends and family.

00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,604
And how much
did you raise?

00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:58,905
$300,000,

00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,041

$1 million of our profits

00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,709

the additional stores.

can't afford to buy

00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:34,040
incredibly expensive,
premium, you know,
vegan dog food.

00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,775
There will be some families
that spend less...

00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:37,043
John:
They'll eat it themselves.

00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:39,311
...on their children
feeding them,

00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:40,379
So, I have a question,

00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:41,847
'cause you've been
observing the dogs

00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,716
that obviously
been eating this.
Yes.

00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:46,285
Over time, when you
force them to be vegan,

00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:47,553
do they change?

00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,855
Do they start wearing
tie‐dye and Birkenstocks,

00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,924
and are they sort of
laid back?

00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,826
Look, you're a very
credible guy,

00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:56,195
but there is no friggin' way
in the world

00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,065
I'm putting $11 million

00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:01,667
on a dog food company that
hasn't sold anything yet.

00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,270
And on top of that,
if you're successful,

00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:07,139
all these dogs are gonna
start dreaming about meat,

00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,108
just sitting
on the sofa going,

00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:10,743
"Ohh, I wish
I could have some meat."
So, Kevin, let me stop you
for one second.

00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:11,911
When you say "meat" ‐‐

00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:13,713
When you say "meat,"
what meat do you think

00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:16,082
goes into conventional
dog food?
I mean,
throw me a bone, Daddy.

00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:18,384
I'm not giving you ‐‐
Chicken feathers and beaks.

00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:19,985

Your background

for over half a million dollars
for 5%

and I have no proof
of this concept whatsoever

00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,336
and it's really expensive,

00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:40,773
how can I invest in that?

00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:42,108
I can't do that.

00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:43,375

00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:51,851
I think the shame
with your business, right,

00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:53,853
is that we can't even hear
what you're pitching

00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:55,988
because you've been trapped
in this prison

00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,389
of an inflated valuation.

00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:00,059
You seem like an amazing guy.
You're probably a genius.

00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:02,128
But you represent what happens

00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:03,662
when you jack up
that valuation

00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:04,663
and you keep pushing it up.

00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:05,765
And at the end of the day,

00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,700
it becomes not
an investable concept.

00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,934
So, for that reason,
I'm out.

00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,369

John: Here's what
I think about it.

00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,509
My company, TurboPUP,

00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:17,676
is going after
the same thing ‐‐

00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:20,379
a lot of antioxidants
for hips and joints,

00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,448
and it's a super food,

00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:23,916
and we're doing great
with it.

00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:27,186
But the valuation
of $11 million

00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:29,054
for a product
that you've never put out,

00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:32,491
I would be slapping my
TurboPUP partner in the face.

00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:35,628
So, in the interest
of America,

00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:38,164
I don't want you to ever,
ever, ever, ever,

00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:42,434
ever, ever, ever, ever publicly
give that valuation again,

00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:43,502
'cause you're
ruining people.

00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:44,603
So, Daymond.

00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:45,805
I'm out.

00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:46,906
Thank you, Daymond.

00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:48,374
I appreciate your feedback.

00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:50,109
Where are we at
with Mark Cuban?

00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:52,411
Look, I get
the proposition, right?

00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:54,013
I'm not even mad
at the valuation

00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:55,114
like these guys are.

00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:57,183
Look, you've got to be able
to convince me

00:21:57,183 --> 00:22:01,620
that you can get through to
enough sales of your product

00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,888
to prove the concept...
Yep.

00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:04,256
...and show some success.
Yep.

00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:07,893
When we're looking at the actual
sales and marketing plan,

00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:10,262
it's a relatively minimal
sales and marketing plan.

00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,531
What we've realized is
it's pretty viral.

00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,099
So you're only gonna
be selling online.

00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:15,367
We're only selling online.
Okay.

00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,036
Is the goal to go back
to the lab

00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:18,737
and introduce
15 new products?

00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,439
No.
Or is the goal
to go from ‐‐

00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,308
to kibble and just scale
where you're at?

00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:24,443
To scale it.
The treat to enter the market.

00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:26,312
Treats to enter,
then kibble.
So, there's a lot of people
like Kevin who have skepticism.

00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:27,313
But the two products.
Two products. Two products.

00:22:27,313 --> 00:22:28,647
You're not all of a sudden
going to

00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:30,816
cats, pigs,
and aardvarks.
No.

00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,084
So ‐‐ So, really,
what we want to do

00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,152
is show success first.

00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:34,520
We have the scaling
infrastructure.

00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,388
We actually have the co‐packer
that can help us scale.

00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:37,623
Okay.
I'll make you an offer.

00:22:37,623 --> 00:22:40,192
I'll give you the $550,000,

00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,561
but I need 10%.

00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:43,896
10%.

00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:46,365
I know that puts the pressure
on your investors.

00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,700
Did you just eat
this dog food?

00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,870
But I'm here for a reason.
Yep.

00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,004
I'll put it back to you.

00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:53,606
So, is there...
No.

00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:54,940
I hear where
you're coming from...

00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,308
No.
No?

00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,245
So...

00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:01,380
So, Mark, do you have
any flexibility whatsoever?

00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,482
No. 10%.
So, there's not a whole lot
of negotiating.

00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:05,351
You have to make a decision,
Ryan ‐‐ yes or no?
It's just a decision.

00:23:05,351 --> 00:23:08,520
So, you know, at the
$9.5 million valuation,

00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,823
that's where, you know,
my investors are at.

00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:15,461
Don't you think
your investors realize

00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:16,996
what Mark Cuban could do
for this company?
Of course.

00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:18,264
Yeah, but it's not even
about me, right?

00:23:18,264 --> 00:23:20,766
You knew when you said yes
to be on "Shark Tank"

00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:22,368
that you were gonna
have to negotiate.

00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:26,872
$550,000, 10% of the company,
and then we have a deal.

00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:31,110
I'm ‐‐ Mark,
I'm willing to do that

00:23:41,654 --> 00:23:42,554
Okay.
Appreciate it.

All right, let's see ‐‐
they won't do any high fives.

If I were to say, you know,
who here in the Shark Tank

00:23:55,234 --> 00:23:57,803
I would've loved to have made
a deal with, it was Mark,

so I know my whole team
is gonna be super excited,

00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:02,841

hopefully work with him

00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:04,643

00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:11,703
I'm Ayaan.

00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:12,604
And this is Sofia.
Hi.

00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:13,572
Hi.

00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,941
So, here's how
Kudo Banz works.

00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:17,910
Kudo Banz starts
with a storybook,

00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,679
where kids learn
that listening is fun.

00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:23,682
At the end of the story,
they get a cool band to wear

00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:25,984
and earn Kudos
for good listening.

00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:28,754
Now, Sofia already
made her bed this morning

00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,456
and ate lunch
without whining...

00:26:30,456 --> 00:26:33,292
[ Laughs ]
...so she's already earned
herself two Kudos.

00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:36,028
The third Kudo you earn
is a magical Kudo.

00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:38,330
Hey, Mom and Dad, let's give
Sofia her third Kudo.

00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,531
Sure.

00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:41,266
It comes to life
with the Kudo Banz app,

00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,936
and it's super cool.

00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,337
Look.

00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:49,308
‐Wow!
‐So cool!

00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:50,342
That is cool.

00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,144
And it unlocks
a customizable wheel

00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:54,279
where kids get rewarded
for good behavior.

00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,615
And kids pick
their own rewards,

00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,351

at bedtime.

of charms you can get,

I take a million pictures

great picture I got with Logan,
