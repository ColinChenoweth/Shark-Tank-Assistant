Herjavec: Tom, how did you
come up with this?

00:33:56,635 --> 00:33:58,970
Armenti: So, I'm actually
the founder of Fat Shack.

00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,039
I started it back
in February of 2010.

00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,074
Uh, Kevin and I know each other
going way back.

00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:04,409
We went to college together.

00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:06,611
But all throughout college,
I never had a job.

00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:08,413
I've actually never really
had a job my whole life,

00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:10,315
and I played online poker
through school

00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:11,316
just to make money
and, you know...

00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:12,617
‐You're kidding.
‐...support myself.

00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:15,287
I just knew I needed
to do something different.

00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:17,188
So, when I graduated
from school,

00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:20,091
I found a local bagel shop
that was near the school.

00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:21,826
And he closed his doors
at 3:00 P. M.,

00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:23,862
and I was able to negotiate
a deal with him

00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:25,864
where I would come in
and run my restaurant

00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:27,666
using his equipment
from 6:00 at night

00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:29,434
until 4:00 in the morning.
‐Come on.

00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:31,336
So I was able to open
the whole concept

00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:33,138
back in Jersey for less ‐‐
‐The Fat is born.

00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:34,573
[ Laughter ]
For less ‐‐

00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,641
Herjavec: I have never heard
of that kind of story.

00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:38,643
Yeah, I was able to open
for less than $5,000,

00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:40,111
so that's how it all started.
‐Very smart.

00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:42,714
You're a hustler.
And I have family
that lives in Colorado

00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:44,182
where Colorado
State University ‐‐

00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:46,184
CSU ‐‐ is. And that's when
I moved out to Colorado,

00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:48,086
opened the first
full Fat Shack.

00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,955
So, how many locations
do you guys have now?

00:34:49,955 --> 00:34:52,591
Right now we have a total of 11
in 3 different states.
And these are all ‐‐

00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:54,659
You own these locations,
or are any of them franchised?

00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,661
So, 9 of them are
franchisees of ours,

00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:58,063
and then Tom and I
own two ‐‐

00:34:58,063 --> 00:34:59,097
two of the other stores.
‐Wow.

00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,132
So, tell us the numbers,
overall sales.

00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:04,603
Cool. So, sales to date since
we started back in 2010

00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:06,471
have been just over
$22 million.

00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:08,273
‐Whoa.
‐What?

00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:10,842
Oh, my God.
Yeah, we sold $22 million
of Fat Shack product...

00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:12,243
‐What about last year?
‐...in the last eight years.

00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:14,245
So ‐‐ So last year,
we did about $5.7 million

00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:15,680
in system‐wide sales.

00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,183
So, what's your franchise fee?
What's your advertising hit?

00:35:18,183 --> 00:35:21,052
Yep. So, our franchise fee
is $18,000.

00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:23,488
‐Okay.
‐And then we have a 6% royalty

00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:25,457
that we take
every ‐‐ every week.
And what about
advertising?

00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:26,658
Uh, advertising,
as of right now,

00:35:26,658 --> 00:35:27,859
we do not have one.
‐Okay.

00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:29,694
What are your revenues,
profits, et cetera?

00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:31,563
So, basically,
any given store,

00:35:31,563 --> 00:35:33,398
we have an average
revenue per year

00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:35,367
is gonna be between
$40,000 and $45,000,

00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:37,135
uh, that we'll get
from those royalties.

00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,004
And of course, we'll have
the $18,000 up front.

00:35:39,004 --> 00:35:41,706
Um, we did $300,000
last year,

00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:44,976
and the profit on that
was just about $170,000.

00:35:46,011 --> 00:35:49,147
This year, we'll do about
$425,000 to $450,000

00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,749
in revenue just
with the franchising.

00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:52,517
So, really, for us
to make our money back,

00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:54,452
we got to open up
a lot of franchises.
For sure.

00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:57,856
Yeah. And that's our plan.
How's your worst‐performing
franchise doing?

00:35:57,856 --> 00:36:00,525
They're still profitable,
our worst‐performing store.

00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:02,861
Like, in terms of revenue
and profitability.
In terms of revenue,

00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:04,796
they'll probably
do about $500,000.

00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:06,464
How much do they make
on the $500,000?

00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,133
So, they'll probably make
about 10% on average

00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:09,501
is what our profit margin is...
‐$50,000.

00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:10,869
...for the franchises
themselves.

00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:12,570
Are they kids? Are they
university students?

00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:13,872
Like, what's
the average ‐‐

00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:15,607
So, we've
specifically worked

00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:17,275
with people
that are younger,

00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:19,878
and a lot of them have actually
come up through our system.

00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:21,513
So, over half
of our franchisees

00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,281
started off working
for me directly...

00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:24,716
‐That's great.
‐...as a delivery driver.

00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:26,384
So, what does it cost
to open up a new unit?

00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:28,787
So, we've opened most of
the units that we have right now

00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:31,656
between $75,000 and
$100,000, start to finish.

00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:34,359
‐Do you fund it?
‐So, there's a few that we have.

00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:36,094
So, like Tom says, if there's
an employee that we have

00:36:36,094 --> 00:36:37,462
that started out
as a delivery driver,

00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:38,797
worked their way up
the ladder,

00:36:38,797 --> 00:36:41,299
we have funded a few of
those stores, um, for them.

00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:46,371
So, you're only offering 7.5%
of basically $140,000 after tax

00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,406
you can distribute.
Think about me as an investor.

00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:50,575
I could take the $250,000,
put it into a REIT,

00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:53,044
making me 9% that has
tremendous distribution

00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,379
or give it to you
with the risk

00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,347
that you somehow
stumble on the rollout.

00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:58,349
So ‐‐
It's not that attractive.
You're not ‐‐

00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:00,151
Yeah, so, right now,
we have five stores

00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:01,453
that are basically
ready to go.

00:37:01,453 --> 00:37:03,188
A couple of the guys,
you know, are waiting ‐‐

00:37:03,188 --> 00:37:04,355
are waiting
for funding from us.

00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:05,857
But isn't it more efficient
for you guys

00:37:05,857 --> 00:37:07,592
to get multi‐unit
operators?

00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:08,993
‐For sure.
‐It definitely helps, yeah.

00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:11,563
I mean ‐‐ So, is the plan just
to, like, grow organically

00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:13,565
and, you know,
enable your employees,

00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,967
or are you looking for
somebody to come along and say,

00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:17,135
"I'll open 10 units"?

00:37:17,135 --> 00:37:19,237
So, our growth strategy
isn't all just employees.

00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:22,140
It definitely is finding people
from the outside, as well.

00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,676
But right now, we are looking
for those owner/operators.

00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:25,977
We want to find
those grinders

00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:27,879
that were like myself
in the very beginning.

00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:31,816
You guys are incredible. I mean,
your whole story is amazing.

00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:35,053
But there isn't
that much money in it.

00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:36,554
I mean,
I get the $22 million.

00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:38,156
But we're talking about

00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:40,759
$150,000 after tax.
So, when we get these
next five stores open,

00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:43,628
that will bring us up
to about $700,000 in revenue

00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:45,497
and about
a $400,000 profit.

00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:48,433
I give you
$250,000, 7.5%,

00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,268
I'm getting about
30 grand a year.

00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,270
I'm assuming
you're doing a distribution.

00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,639
‐Yeah, definitely.
‐So I'm getting 30 grand,

00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:58,109
which is 12% interest
on my $250,000.

00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,078
It's interesting,
but, you know,

00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:03,281
you don't get to be a Shark by
making interest along the way.

00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,816
‐Yeah, for sure.
‐How do I get that $250,000

00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:08,086
to be $2 million?
Is it just more locations?

00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:09,988
Yeah. Our goal is
to increase, you know,

00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:11,189
the footprint across
the country.

00:38:11,189 --> 00:38:12,690

proven the model.

into a corporation

going anywhere with this.
