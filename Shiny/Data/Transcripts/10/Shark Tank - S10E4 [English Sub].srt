Why did you do that?

I can't afford it.

in fashion business

00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:40,465

So, how much
is this shirt?

00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:13,131

Falkenburg: Well,
actually 2/3 of it

is gonna be going into
additional inventory

They're not inexpensive, but
I think for what you're doing,

you're gonna definitely
need one of them,

00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:43,154

you're gonna survive.

Obviously, you've got
a customer‐acquisition cost

00:38:49,227 --> 00:38:51,362
that's less than the margin
on each shirt.

00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:54,532
And so the more cash
you have for advertising,

00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:56,668
the more you can make.

00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:59,337
But yet, you want to put more
into inventory.

00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:03,741
