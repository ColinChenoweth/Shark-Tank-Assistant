‐What about this year?

This year, we're on track to do
between $1.6 and $1.7 million.

Where are you
selling?

00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,528
So, we're a predominantly online
direct‐to‐consumer brand.

00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:32,631
We sell on Amazon,
on my website,

00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:34,432
handful of
brick‐and‐mortar stores.

in Kickstarter or Indiegogo?

‐None.
‐None?

Greiner: Wow.
So, Kate, I'd love
to see how it works.

00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:46,745
Basically, what you do is
you're gonna make sweet tea,

00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:49,648
then you're gonna open up
that SCOBY pouch,

00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,049
and you're gonna
pour it in.

00:35:51,049 --> 00:35:54,152
So, you can see that little
SCOBY's down in the bottom.

00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,821
You're gonna put
the cotton cover on top of it.

00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,323
You'll follow
the instructions.

00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:00,425
There's pH strips.
You'll do a little test,

00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:03,161
you'll put a temperature gauge
on the side,

00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,629
and then it's gonna just
sit on your kitchen counter

00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:06,998
for approximately
10 days,

00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,667
and the fermentation
is complete.

00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:11,036
So, you're obviously
selling a lot...

00:36:11,036 --> 00:36:12,437
Yes.
...and doing great.

00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:13,738
What do you need
the money for?

00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:17,442
So, I'm here for a strategic
partner to scale.

00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:20,145
I've brought this company
as far as I can on my own.

00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:22,047

this whole time.

I don't know what I don't know.

00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:28,720

learned everything that I can,

00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,588
but I don't know retail.

00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:32,791
It's a market that I don't
have access to right now,

00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:33,992

what's your dream retailer?

00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:37,462
Where would you
want to sell this?
Whole Foods.

00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:41,066
Those boxes take up a tremendous
amount of shelf space.

00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:43,034
That's why I stacked
these here 'cause this
is how I pictured this.

00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,202
You go into
Whole Foods, right?

00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,638
They do tons
of these little products

00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:48,807

the middle of the aisle.

You didn't give us
some numbers on your cost

and what you sell it
for, did you?

00:36:52,277 --> 00:36:55,847
So, this kit right here
is $11 to make.

00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:57,649
We sell it retail
for $45.

00:36:57,649 --> 00:37:00,518
The deluxe kit is $23.

00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:02,020
We sell that for $75.

00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,723
Kate, I got bad news.
These are barely enough margins

00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,057
to play
in the retail space,

00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,993
considering they won't
pay you for 60 days.

00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:10,795

an amazing business.

the business you have.

That's after

00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:25,076
What does it cost you to acquire
a customer ‐‐ a new customer?

00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:28,046
Currently zero. I've never
put any money into advertising.

00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:30,448
Yay!
[ Laughter ]

00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:32,717
Okay, so, you're
gonna make $500,000

00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:34,319
after you've paid all
your staff and yourself.

00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:37,355
Yes.
So, we're gonna pay some tax
on that this year.

00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:39,858
So, you're gonna have
$300,000 left

when that's all done,
which is great.
Yeah.

00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:44,329
But because it's not
proprietary or protectable

00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:46,164
and all that stuff, you have
to start thinking

about what multiple
as an investor

half of that.

unclear on that.

When we asked you why you need
the support and the money,

00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:39,684
you said,
"To go to retail."

00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:42,287
Your margins right now
don't really support retail,

and you're doing so great
in direct marketing.

Oh, I'm ugly crying
on TV right now.

00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:59,884
I have admired Sara and Barbara
for so long.

00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:02,687
But, honestly, I would have done
a deal with Mark.

00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:06,157
I admire him so much, and...

00:42:06,157 --> 00:42:08,926
I'm a little sad he didn't
even get to get an offer in.

00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:11,629
Mark, I had a feeling you
were gonna overbid us.

00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:12,930
Am I right?
‐Yeah, in a heartbeat.

00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,032
It would have taken me
one phone call

00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:15,333
to get them
into Whole Foods.

00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:16,768
Why were you so quiet?

00:42:16,768 --> 00:42:18,436
Normally, people at least
give me a shot.

00:42:18,436 --> 00:42:20,705
And if she didn't want
to, maybe she just didn't
want a deal with me, so...

00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:22,206
No, not at all.
Not at all.
She probably just...

00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,574
Ah, don't take it
personal.
...didn't realize it.

00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:25,209
She probably just
liked the deal.
