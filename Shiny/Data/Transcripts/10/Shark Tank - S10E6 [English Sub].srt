an entrepreneur my whole life.

I bought big bags of candy.

In junior high, I started
a lawn‐mowing company.

more than $6 making this.

to be able to buy inventory
to be able to buy at the volume

reduce the cost.

Over the last 12 months,
tell me how much you've netted.

00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:22,080

the last 12 months, is $35,000.

this other form of payment

00:41:21,546 --> 00:41:23,548

Sometimes
you have to understand

when the opportunity
of a lifetime is hitting you,

00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:35,059

you're cashing a check

of several hundred
million dollars,

you're not gonna worry
about the 5% or the 10%.

Could we go back
to the initial deal?

If you're willing to do the 25%

It was worth giving up
more equity for ARod, one,

because he connects
with our story,

there's a bigger pie out there.
