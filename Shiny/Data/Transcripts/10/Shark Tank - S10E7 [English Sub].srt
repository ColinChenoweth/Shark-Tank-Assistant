00:32:19,805 --> 00:32:22,307
poached eggs,
and even bacon.
Wow.

00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:25,710
I'm ready to expand OatMeals
all across America.

00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:28,046
So, Sharks, who's ready
to top off my oatmeal

00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,247
with some cash?

00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:30,782
‐Feed me.
‐We want the oatmeal first.

00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,884
Cuban: Feed me.
Yeah, do you have
truffle oatmeal?

00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:33,919
Yes!
Feed me.

00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:34,786
I have some samples
for you guys.

00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,121
Oh, my gosh.

00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:39,591
Okay, so I'm serving you guys
the truffle risotto,

00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:40,625
and I added bacon
to this one.

00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,227
Truffle?
Oh, bacon.

00:32:42,227 --> 00:32:43,528
Yes.
That's like talking dirty
to me.

00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:45,964
So, the truffle risotto is
shaved Parmesan cheese,

00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,467
truffle oil, bacon,
sea salt, and pepper.

00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:49,835
What are the other ones?

00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:55,073
So, then the hot date
is bananas...

00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:58,243
Wow!
...pecans, dates,
uh, honey,

00:32:58,243 --> 00:33:00,779
our house granola,
and some peanut butter.

00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:04,382
And then lastly,
the antioxidant awakening.

00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:05,584
‐Oh, my God.
‐Awaken me.

00:33:05,584 --> 00:33:06,451
Awaken me.

00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:08,553
The truffle is amazing!

00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:09,521
‐Yay!
‐Oh, my God.

00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:11,490
Is the pomegranate one
a dessert?

00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,124
Stephens: Well, it's actually
pretty healthy

00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:15,560
because it has
the Greek yogurt...
That's pretty good.

00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,930
...chia seeds,
dark chocolate chips.

00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,899
‐Oh, my God, I'm in love.
‐Awesome.

00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:22,367
‐Oh, this is incredible.
‐It's so good.

00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:23,835
Corcoran: I love the bacon
with the cheese.

00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:24,736
Yum!
Ohh!

00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,804
John:
And I hate oatmeal!

00:33:25,804 --> 00:33:27,138
It's like a dinner,
not a breakfast.

00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:28,740
So, um, in the shop...
This is delicious!

00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,476
...people really didn't know
about savory oats,

00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:34,579
but you can get all the benefits
of eating oatmeal

00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:35,680
for lunch or dinner,
not just for breakfast.
This is great!

00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,815
‐What is it?
‐Just grab it, yeah.

00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:39,851
What are the caloric
and carbo metrics to this?

00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,786
So, in the shop,
the bowls come

00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:44,623
in a baby, mama,
or papa bear size ‐‐

00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:46,892
8, 12, or 16 ounces.

00:33:46,892 --> 00:33:51,630
The baby bear, plain,
starts at just 110 calories,

00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,965
the mama bear, 150 calories,

00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,166
and then the papa bear,
about 180.

00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,235
Why don't you give us
some prices on those, as well?

00:33:57,235 --> 00:34:00,972
Yes, um, the baby bear starts
at $4.25,

00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:03,708
mama bear, $5.25,
papa pear, $6.25,

00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,578
and that includes two toppings
of your choice.

00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:09,314
Each additional topping
is either 50 cents

00:34:09,314 --> 00:34:10,882
or 25 cents.

00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,652
We get a lot of different things
that come into the Shark Tank,

00:34:13,652 --> 00:34:14,853
a lot of different foods.

00:34:14,853 --> 00:34:18,056
These are some of
the most delicious things

00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,758
ever brought in here.
Thank you so much.

00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:22,761
And the interesting thing
is they're all very different.

00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:23,929
Exactly.

00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:25,030
What is the game plan here?

00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,565
This is a store
that sells oatmeal?

00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,366
It is, um...
Single location?

00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:31,236
I can show you a picture
of the store.

00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:32,504
That's the exterior.

00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:34,706
I'm in Greenwich Village
on West 3rd Street

00:34:34,706 --> 00:34:36,374
in Downtown New York City.

00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:38,977
You want me to invest
in this single store?

00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:41,012
Yeah, so I'd like
to expand firstly

00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:42,747
in New York City,
either in Midtown Manhattan ‐‐

00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,215
So you want to open
more locations?

00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:46,117
‐Yes.
‐How did you come up with this?

00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:47,719
Stephens: So, I had this idea,

00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,654
but I really didn't know
how to make it happen.

00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:51,423
I was working in
the investment banking world

00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,458
as an executive assistant
for many years,

00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,327
then I finally went
to culinary school

00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:56,795
while I was working full‐time

00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:58,863
because I knew
I really needed the credentials

00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:01,600
as being a chef
to make this happen.

00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,502
So, after I became a chef,
I finally, you know,

00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:07,339
left my career,
and made this happen.

00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:08,940
I've been open for six years,

00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,742
the business has been growing
every year.

00:35:10,742 --> 00:35:14,012
Can you tell us if it's been
profitable and for how long?

00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:18,083
So, over six years, um,
I've made $2.5 million.

00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:19,351
What about this year?

00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:22,087
This year, I'm on track
to do $500,000.

00:35:22,087 --> 00:35:23,588
How many square feet
is the store?

00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:25,991
It's 380 square feet.

00:35:25,991 --> 00:35:27,859
Sam, what were your profits
last year?

00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:31,596
So, uh, $470,000 last year
gross,

00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:33,531
the net was $45,000.

00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:35,667
‐After you paid yourself?
‐Yes.

00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,335
And what did you
pay yourself?

00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:38,970
Not much. [ Laughs ]

00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,072
Probably about 40 grand.

00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:42,540
Corcoran: And how do you
support yourself

00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,776
if you're only taking out
$40,000?

00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:46,578
I know New York is
so expensive.

00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:49,180
Do you even have the money
to eat your own oatmeal?

00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,850
[ Chuckles ] That's basically
all I can really afford to eat.

00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,018
[ Laughs ]

00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:55,820
Um, I'm also a spokesperson
for Quaker Oats.

00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,289
I was approached
by Pepsi Quaker...
You are?

00:35:58,289 --> 00:35:59,991
...right after I opened
the store.

00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,594
Um, I've had some really
great press just organically.

00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:03,928
And they pay you
for that?

00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:06,665
They do. My contract with them
is $60,000 this year,

00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:07,866
it's not much.
Cuban: No, that's awesome.

00:36:07,866 --> 00:36:08,900
You're making more
with Qu‐‐ with them

00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,235
than you are your store.
That's awesome.

00:36:10,235 --> 00:36:14,406
Have you ever thought of
taking your different oatmeals

00:36:14,406 --> 00:36:17,776
and packaging them so that they
could be in freezer sections?

00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:20,612
Absolutely. Um, because
I always thought it would be fun

00:36:20,612 --> 00:36:22,681
to do a packaged food line.

00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:25,517
You know, getting oatmeal
out of the breakfast aisle

00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,686
and into the rice
and pasta aisle.

00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:30,689
I think you face
a pretty high mountain to climb

00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:33,358
because the perception
of the consumer in America

00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:36,594
with oatmeal is going
to be forever with breakfast.

00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:39,564
Very creative, product's great,
everybody agrees.

00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:40,999
But I don't think
about eating oatmeal

00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:44,069
after 10:00 in the morning,
like 99.999% of the ‐‐

00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:45,303
No, that's not true.
That's not true at all.

00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:46,638
Let me finish, Mark.
Let me finish.

00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:48,907
But I'm more concerned
about the numbers.

00:36:48,907 --> 00:36:51,509
350 square feet, you need
to be doing about $1 million,

00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:55,380
$1.2 million a year to make this
an interesting opportunity

00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,583
to expand to more locations
or to franchise,

00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,852
because you're basically making
no money.

00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:04,456
You can't even live in New York
for $45,000.

00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:05,890
There's rats that are making
more money than that.

00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,092
‐[ Laughs ]
‐Right.

00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:10,462
You are not worth $2.5 million
as an opportunity.

00:37:10,462 --> 00:37:13,198
I'm out.

00:37:13,198 --> 00:37:14,466
John: I think
you're figuring out ‐‐

00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:16,000
I mean, it's clear
you're the oatmeal whisperer,

00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,536
but, you know,
at $500,000,

00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:20,505
I think even if you had
some good years

00:37:20,505 --> 00:37:22,173
on the second or third store,

00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:24,509
it would take me 12 years
to get my money back.

00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:25,643
So I'm out.

00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:26,811
Stephens: Thank you.

00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:28,613
Greiner: Well, here's one of
the problems ‐‐

00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:30,515
locations, right?
Mm‐hmm.

00:37:30,515 --> 00:37:33,351
My Bantam Bagels, they came in
with one bagel ball

00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:35,153
that was stuffed
with great cream cheeses

00:37:35,153 --> 00:37:36,521
in different flavors,

00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:39,090
and we got
into Starbucks nationwide.

00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,492
That was pivotal.

00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:43,261
And then got into
all the grocery stores.

00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,230
And now we've done
$40 million.

00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,899
I'm trying to think
how could we try

00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:49,667
to replicate that model?

00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:51,836
And the big question
really goes to you.

00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:56,074
So, are you open to packaging,
selling in retail?

00:37:56,074 --> 00:37:57,642
Like, doing a completely
different model.

00:37:57,642 --> 00:37:58,777
Absolutely.

00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,145
All right, then I'm gonna
give you an offer.

00:38:00,145 --> 00:38:02,680
I'm gonna make it contingent,
though,

00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,784
on if you will figure out
packaging.

00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:07,986
Pick top flavors.

00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:10,255
We'll try to bring it
to Starbucks.

00:38:10,255 --> 00:38:12,524
I'll give you the $500,000,

00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:14,926
but I want 33.3%.

00:38:14,926 --> 00:38:17,095
I want to be a third partner.

00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:19,364
'Cause it's gonna be
quite a bit of work.

00:38:19,364 --> 00:38:21,366
‐Okay.
‐I have another offer for you,

00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:24,302
but I have a whole different
spin on your business.

00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:27,038
I believe you could have
a very successful business

00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:29,607
if you brought
your business onto a cart

00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:31,209
and serve oatmeal
to corporate America

00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:33,778
in the morning
and risotto for lunch.

00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:35,880
I don't think
it's that much of a change.

00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,583
And I'd be happy to give you
the $500,000,

00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:41,352
but I want 50%
of not your store ‐‐

00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:43,688
no interest in something
that doesn't make money.

00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:45,924
But I'll give you
the $500,000

00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:49,160
if I could own 50%
of the cart business

00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,762
and let the money be
entirely used

00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:53,198
for making that business
a reality.

00:38:53,198 --> 00:38:55,400
That doesn't have a contingency
like Lori, right?

00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,335
Well, I guess you could say
the contingency

00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,438
is the money's only to be used
for the cart business.

00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,941
We must be on the planet Zutron
right now.

00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:05,376
Go away, be quiet.
You are the store
that makes no money,

00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:07,846
have two half‐a‐million‐dollar
offers.

00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,614
That never happens
on the planet Earth.

00:39:09,614 --> 00:39:11,583
So you better think about this
right now

00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:13,551
and make a decision.

00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:15,753
Sammy,
what do you want to do?

the key to that deal

was looking at it
differently.
