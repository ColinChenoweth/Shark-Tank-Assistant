a weekly subscription

00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,902
that delivers healthy,
fresh, delicious kids' meals

00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,204
straight to the doors
of busy parents.

00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:26,472
No cooking required.

00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,274
And every meal
that we deliver

00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,576
comes with a fun activity
and collectible

00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:33,279
to keep the kids
excited and engaged.

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,816
So who wants to join us
in taking mealtime stress

00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,318
off of parents'
plates forever?

00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,053

Joanna: Great. David's gonna
pass out some food.
We're ready to Yumble!

00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:48,161
Joanna:
What you'll notice on the side
is our welcome packet,

00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,563
which comes with our deliveries.

00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,799
It includes a welcome note
for the parents...
Greiner: Thank you.

00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:55,335
...to walk them through
the process and the product.

00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,704
And it also includes
some coins and collectibles

00:13:57,704 --> 00:14:00,239
for the children.
‐Oh, cute! Are these stickers?

00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,775
‐Those are trading cards.
‐Oh!

00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,977
So, all of you
have the chicken pops.

00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:08,147
They taste like chicken nuggets.
They look like cake pops.

00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:11,484
But they're made from premium,
antibiotic‐free, hormone‐free

00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:12,852
white meat chicken.
‐Very good.

00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,588
Then you all have one of our
handmade, baked empanadas.

00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:18,291
‐This empanada's terrific.
‐The empanada is excellent.

00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:21,260
Mmm!
Then you have
our Smac N' Cheese cups.

00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,663
Tastes like mac and cheese,
but believe it or not,

00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:26,199
It's got as much protein
as a serving of chicken.

00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,233
Does a plate
come with this?

00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,434
The plate does not
come with it.

00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:29,902
Our meals actually
come in a tray.

00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,003
And it fits in a lunchbox?

00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,605
And it can fit
in a lunchbox. Exactly.

00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,707
Okay, so, this is three meals
a day you're providing?

00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,776
Parents have a choice
of three different meal plans.

00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:40,513
Okay.
They can either order 6 meals,
12 meals, or 24 meals.

00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:44,150
Every week, there's
22 different items on the menu

00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,319
for the customers
to choose from.

00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:47,987
O'Leary: You know,
just a few years ago,

00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:50,723
we had a company called
"Plated" on "Shark Tank."

00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,159
They were also
in the meal‐kit business.

00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:56,295
They actually got sold to
Albertsons for $300 million.

00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,397
I was their investor.

00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,465
It was a very interesting ride,

00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:02,068
a very challenging one,
but a great outcome.

00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,103
Now I really know the numbers
of that business...

00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:05,738
‐Yep.
‐...very well.

00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,374
And so, it's time
to get to the numbers.

00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:11,411
So, we have a little bit
more than $1.3 million
in sales already.

00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,578
Greiner: Wow!

00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,415
We've been growing at
about a 30‐something percent

00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,749
growth rate
month over month.

00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,251
And our
customer‐acquisition cost

00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:21,954
blended over the last
year‐to‐date is 40 bucks.

00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,689
How many total subscribers
do you have right now?

00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:24,857
‐Active customers, we have...
‐Active customers, yeah.

00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,225
‐...a few thousand.
‐Couple thousand.

00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:27,627
How ‐‐ what do you
charge a month?

00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:29,195
‐It's a weekly subscription.
‐It's a weekly subscription.

00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:31,330
How much a meal? How much a day?
How much a week?

00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:35,101
It ranges right now from
$6.99 a meal to $7.99 a meal.

00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,569
That includes delivery.
‐And shipping and everything?

00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:38,004
It includes
all the collectibles.

00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:40,506
Yep. Over 70% of our customers

order again
their first chance to reorder.

00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,311
How much do you spend
on advertising and
marketing and promotion?

00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,013
So, over the first few months,
we were spending, like,

00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:48,915
something like $4,000 a week.
‐A week? Wow.

00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:50,316
‐A week.
‐So, that's $48,000.

00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:51,751
Yeah,
so in the very beginning,

00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,386
our customer‐acquisition
costs were higher.

00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,822
We were a no‐name brand.
We were learning how to
optimize our funnel,

00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:58,124
and we were able to get
the customer‐acquisition costs

00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:01,794
down from $100 down to $40.
‐Okay.

00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,764
So, here's the killer question
that all investors have

00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:07,967
for this industry that changed
when Amazon bought Whole Foods

00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,304
and started acquiring
customers in Whole Foods.

00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,039
Then Albertsons bought Plated

00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:16,142
with 36 million customers
going into all the stores.

00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,611
How are you going to beat guys
that have brick and mortar

00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,713
that can solicit
their millions of customers

00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:24,283
that go in to buy grocery
to even know about you?

00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:26,652
Well, you're not cooking here.
Plated, it's not the same model.

00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,287

00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:04,590
So, I auditioned for this team,
barely made it.

00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,492
And I remember
just being super embarrassed.

00:27:06,492 --> 00:27:08,227
I went back to my dorm room,

00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:12,865
and I would learn some dance
moves off of online videos,

00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:15,300
record myself doing it
in front of the camera,

00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,102
and then compare
the two things side to side...
Ha! That's great.

00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:18,504
‐Nice.
‐...for a year and a half

00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:20,472

those two left feet.

00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,341

‐And I led the first‐ever

00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:23,642
Bollywood dance team
to the semifinals

00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:24,910

00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,245

‐That's amazing!

00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:28,480
...back when "Slumdog
Millionaire" came out. Jai Ho!

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,818
So, let's talk numbers.
How many locations do you have?

00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:35,087
We teach about
500 classes a week.

00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:36,522
‐How many locations?
‐At how many locations?

00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:38,724
‐Yeah. About 350.
‐350?

00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:41,160
‐350 locations?
‐Yes. Yes.

00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,328
We actually run
a subscription model,

00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,030
so we train instructors,

00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:49,034
and then we license the brand
and our content, our routines.

00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:51,470
And the instructors go out
and teach at different gyms.

00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,838
And what do they charge,
and how much do you ‐‐

00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,206
how much do
the instructors keep,

00:27:54,206 --> 00:27:55,240
and how much do you get?

00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,744
So, instructors pay us
$20 a month.

00:27:58,744 --> 00:28:00,245
Oh, it's just a straight
subscription service.

00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:01,246
Just for the
subscription service

00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:02,481
and the ability
to use the brand.

00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:04,883
‐20 bucks a month is nothing.
‐It's not much.

00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:07,619
It is, uh ‐‐ so, well, we've got
1,100 paying subscribers.

00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:09,054
‐Per month? 20 bucks?
‐Good for you.

00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:10,222
They're paying $20 a month.

00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:11,990
We've got roughly $20,000
in that business...

00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,625
‐A month?
‐...income. Correct. Per month.

00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,928
Okay, so ‐‐ so, look,
I get, clearly,

00:28:15,928 --> 00:28:18,297
on this panel,
the Bollywood component.

00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:21,133
But I have to think
about this as an investor,

00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:24,603
and I'm trying to understand
how $20,000 a month

00:28:24,603 --> 00:28:28,040
gets me to quite
a sporty valuation.

00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,374
And that's a fair point.
So, we have ‐‐

00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:32,177
we have about $1 million
in lifetime sales.

00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:35,948
Our gross margins are about 86%.
We are cash‐flow positive.

00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:37,749
We actually just crossed that
milestone three months ago.

00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:39,318
How many years
have you been in business?

00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:41,486
Uh, we've been in business
for five years.
Greiner: Five.

00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:43,322
The majority of that revenue
came in the last three years.

00:28:43,322 --> 00:28:46,091
That's your only income, the
$20,000 a month, the 20 bucks?

00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:47,626
No, no.
So, our vision is to build

00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:50,128
the world's biggest
Bollywood‐inspired
fitness community.

00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:51,363
So, what we've done is

00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:53,565
we've started to put out
samples of our content

00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:57,202
on channels like YouTube and our
own BollyX On Demand platform.

00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:59,371
And we already have 300 paying
customers on that platform.

00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:01,406
‐How much do they pay a month?
‐They pay $9 a month.

00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:04,009

is to utilize the ‐‐

There's a ton of great health

Allison has a personal
story about that.

She started drinking it
to detox and to lose weight.

00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:44,142
So, if you dilute ACV,

00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:47,178
does the function of the
apple cider vinegar still stand?

00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:49,214
Allison: Yes.
Or is it pretty much
like you've subdued it?

00:35:49,214 --> 00:35:50,649
So, they recommend
to dilute it

00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,183
because if you just
take it straight, like,

00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:54,219

So, it retails
for $2.99 to $3.59

based on the
retailer's margin.

What's the cost
to make the product?

00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:35,060

anywhere between 78 cents

for the volumes you have.

out of this thing alive

get over the taste,

00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:53,471

to my kitchen and created this.

the Whole Foods buyer

00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:59,611
tried our product
at the farmers market

00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,613
and said, "You guys
have to be in Whole Foods."

Are you now full‐time
into the vinegar deal?

‐Full‐time.

At what valuation?

So, that was at
a $600,000 valuation.

00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:12,423

And now you're worth
$4 million?

00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,593
I'm out.

00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:29,794
‐Okay, thank you.
‐Thank you.

00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:32,463
I like it. It's great
that it's low calorie.

00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:35,366
Um, my only concern is
just struggling

00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:36,801
with the competitive edge.

00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:38,536
I see your vision,
but I don't think

00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:40,805
that you have gotten there yet.

00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:44,509
For me, I'll be a customer,
but I won't be a partner.

00:40:44,509 --> 00:40:46,511
I'm out.
‐Thank you for that.

00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:47,812
Well, there's one shark left.

00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:49,013
Then there was one.

00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:51,049
‐Yeah.
‐And in the beverage business.

00:40:51,049 --> 00:40:52,250
Oza: But actually,
I'm not smart enough

00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,252
to have created
my own beverage ever.

00:40:54,252 --> 00:40:58,089
I find smart entrepreneurs,
um, and I partner with them.

00:40:58,089 --> 00:40:59,891
And they're the ones who have
the vision for the brand,

00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:02,260
but I've become the number‐one
consigliere for them.

00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:05,396
So, I'm gonna give you an offer.

00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:06,397
‐Whoa, kitty!
‐Yes!

00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:08,232
Gonna give you an offer.

00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:10,301
But the valuation is not
what you're gonna want it to be.

00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:15,640
Beverage is savage.

00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,875
As Bethenny will tell you,
I'll tell you, it's savage.

00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:19,677
The mathematics
for a company that,

00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:21,946
this year,
has done $250,000,

00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:25,283
if we take it 12 months,
you're at...

00:41:25,283 --> 00:41:26,584
$360,000.

00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:29,387
Let's even round it up
to $400,000.

00:41:29,387 --> 00:41:32,390
That puts you at
a $1.6‐odd million valuation.

00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:36,728
So, for $400,000,
for me to get interested,

00:41:36,728 --> 00:41:38,796
it's got to be more like...

00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:40,098
25%.

00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:45,303

good offer for you.
