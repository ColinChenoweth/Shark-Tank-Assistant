that already
have allergens in it.

00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:53,739
But those are just not
the right format.

00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:55,474
How did you
come up with this?

00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:56,608
So, let me tell you
a little bit

00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:57,809
about the inspiration
for the company.

00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:59,645
We actually have
a photo of him,

00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:00,679
and I'll tell you
about my family.

00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,481
‐Aww.
‐So, that's Abe.

00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:04,483
‐Cute.
‐So, Abe is 3 years old.

00:28:04,483 --> 00:28:05,717
I'm a practicing
physician.

00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:07,553
I work
at a cancer hospital.

00:28:07,553 --> 00:28:08,787
There was a time
in the past

00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:10,055
where I had to
rush home from work

00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:12,858
because Abe was having a severe
food‐allergy reaction.

00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,860
Oh, my gosh.
I wouldn't want anyone

00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,395
to go through
that experience.

00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:17,095
Oh, we have.

00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:19,865
So, that's why I'm so passionate
about our mission

00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:22,834
to prevent food allergies
before they start.

00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,870
How much cash have you invested
in the business?

00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,705
So far, we've raised
$2.4 million...

00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:27,706
‐Ooh.
‐Wow!

00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:28,807
...all at the same valuation

00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:30,075
that we're inviting you
to join at.

00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:33,779
When I look at this, I think
it doesn't promise enough.

00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:36,982
I'd like it to clearly say
"Avoids allergies,"

00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:38,684
but you can't make that claim.

00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:40,619
You can't go that far
to actually say

00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:42,487
"Avoids allergies," right?

00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:43,121
That's exactly right.

00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:45,791
So, that's why we primarily
focus through online sales

00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:47,726
where we can wrap it
in additional context

00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,161
and education that really helps
describe the product.

00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:51,330
Yeah, but you still
have to be there to
describe it, to say it.

00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,065
You've got to put other words.
Right, 'cause you have
your name ‐‐ Yeah.

00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:55,067
So, it's not
clear as a crystal bell

00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:58,036
that if I pick this up,
I'm gonna avoid allergies.

00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:01,440
I think that's a weakness,
and for those reasons, I'm out.

00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,009
What does it cost me
to buy this?

00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:05,978
$48 a month
is our retail price.

00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:07,913
And what does it cost you
to make it?

00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:10,882
Our cost right now is $10.50,
so we have 70% margin.

00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:12,918
What's my total cost
per child?

00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:15,654
So, if you pre‐pay all up front,
it's $200.

00:29:15,654 --> 00:29:17,022
If you pay month by month,
it's $288.

00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:22,694
So, for $288, I can maybe stop
my child from having an allergy?

00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:23,862
Yes, absolutely.

00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:26,632
That's a good
value proposition.

00:29:26,632 --> 00:29:28,667
Does it have to be equity?

00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:29,935

a royalty's coming.

I would give you the $350,000

You're so new, you're going to
need a lot of money,

and there's some things that
I'm willing to back the bus up.

00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:03,295
But it scares me to do that
on too many deals.

00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:07,399
And unfortunately,
for that reason, I'm out.

00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:08,967
I don't think
the marketing

00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:10,936
is about spending money
on marketing.

00:31:10,936 --> 00:31:12,904
I think the education
is inherent

00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:14,906
because every parent
freaks out about it,

00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:16,808
so they go
and they educate themselves.

00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:18,110
So they will self‐educate,

00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:21,113
then they'll start looking
where to find a solution.

00:31:21,113 --> 00:31:22,748
I'm gonna make you
an offer,

00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:25,016
and there's gonna be
a contingency, okay?

00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:28,854
I'll give you the $350,000,
I want 12%,

00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:31,256
2% of that can be in advisory,

00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:35,861
but the contingency is that
we do a low‐cost version,

00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:38,964
and that for every subscription
that we sell,

00:31:38,964 --> 00:31:41,967
we do one free

Right?
That's my offer.

00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:45,270
So, in summary,
it's $350,000 for 12%.

00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,973
$350,000, of which 2%
can be advisory shares.

‐I'll go cheddar and garlic.
‐Fantastic.

00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:24,856
Mr. Wonderful, how are you?
Thank you, thank you.

00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:25,957
Barbara, how are you?

00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,025
Corcoran:
I'm good, Dustin.

00:35:27,025 --> 00:35:28,460
[ Laughter ]

00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,261
Hello, Mark. How are you?
Hello. I'm good,

00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:31,296
'cause I'm a growing boy.
Mmm.

00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:32,397
Take all of them.

00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:34,265
I got cases after cases
for you.

00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:35,467
No doubt.

00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:38,603
All we are is literally sorghum
with no fillers.

00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:41,206
We air‐pop it, add cold‐pressed
oil and seasoning ‐‐

00:35:41,206 --> 00:35:42,374
nothing else.

00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:44,342
So, I can tell you a little bit
about my background.

00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:46,511
I've spent 13 years
in the food industry.

00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:49,047
Before that, I was an investment
banker at Goldman Sachs.

00:35:49,047 --> 00:35:50,181
I went to General Mills,
where I launched

00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:52,384
the first nationwide
gluten‐free product ever.

00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:55,286
I've worked on numerous brands,
but this is my first start‐up.

00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:58,490
And I did this because I wanted
authentically healthy snacks

00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,592
that deliver
authentic nutrition,

00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:03,028
and that's what
you're eating here today.
O'Leary:
I want to tell you something.

00:36:03,028 --> 00:36:05,163
I've tried a lot of this GMO,

00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,232
no carb, blah‐da,
yada, yada, yada.

00:36:07,232 --> 00:36:09,067
This is good.
‐Very good.

00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:10,168
‐Thank you very, very much.
‐It is good.

00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,403
‐Really good.
‐Tasty.
‐Great product.

00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:12,537
Thank you so much,
Rohan.

00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:15,173
It's gonna be fun 'cause
it's one of the first times

00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,208
in "Shark Tank" history
where we have an actual

00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,544
investment banker
at a crazy valuation.

00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:21,246
[ Laughter ]
Oza: This is
going to be great.

00:36:21,246 --> 00:36:22,480
‐Let's have some fun.
‐How do you know it's crazy?

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,382
This is a great valuation.
You're in my wheelhouse,
buddy.

00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:26,451
Explain why you're worth
$7 million.

00:36:26,451 --> 00:36:30,288
So, our sales were $150,000
as we just got going last year.

00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:33,224
This year, we're on pace
to do about $1.2 million.

00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:34,459
Wow.
In the last ‐‐

00:36:34,459 --> 00:36:36,394
Any profits?
I'll come back to profits
in a second.

00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:37,395
I don't like that answer.

00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:39,330
Well, $50,000
three months ago,

00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:40,432
$60,000, $70,000,

00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:42,434
we're on pace to do
$70,000‐plus this month.

00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:45,136
The reality in the food space,
unfortunately,

00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:46,304
is it's really
a gross‐margin game.

00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:48,473
So, we are doing outstanding
on a gross‐margin front.

00:36:48,473 --> 00:36:50,375
We're high 40s, low 50s
on our gross margin.

00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,444
Is that after trade spend?
That's after trade spend.

00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:55,213
Yeah.
I have game‐changer
type of investors.

00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,215
So, I have the ex‐head
of Whole Foods grocery,

00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,416
I have the founder
of Boulder Brands,

00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:00,151
the founder of
Pacific Foods.

00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:01,186
They're investors
in my company.

00:37:01,186 --> 00:37:02,387
‐Invested.
‐Oh, investors? Wow.

00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:04,522
One of the reasons that I've
been so successful so far ‐‐

00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:07,058
we're 1,000 doors,
100% selling rate ‐‐

00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,226
is they open the door.

00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,428
You put me in front of someone,
I will sell them.

00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:11,663
How much have
you put in personally,

00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:13,498
and how much have you taken
in investment?

00:37:13,498 --> 00:37:16,401
So, I initially put in
$50,000 to start.

00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:17,469
What about investors?

00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:19,437
So, investors,
my first pre‐revenue round

00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:21,940
took on $943,000,
including my money.

00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,974
‐Wow.
‐Wow.

00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:23,675
That's a lot to take in.

00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:25,477
That's your first
pre‐revenue round.
It was not expected.

00:37:25,477 --> 00:37:27,512
I was going out there,
selling hard, hustling.

00:37:27,512 --> 00:37:29,347
It was the hardest thing I've
ever done was pre‐revenue raise.

00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:30,648
Got that. No, okay,
so let's put that aside,

00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:32,450
'cause you're a grinder,
we know it...
Yep. Yep.

00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,219
...you're smart,
you've been there.
Right.

00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:35,320
How much more
have you taken in,

00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,122
and how much of the company
do you own right now?

00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:38,590
So, I just started
another round.

00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,126
Most of my first‐round people
want to come back in,

00:37:41,126 --> 00:37:42,160
which is a great sign.
That's good.

00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,461
We have some
Forbes 400 people

00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:45,363
that are also interested in
coming in on this round.
Good for you.

00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:46,498
At this point,
I still have 100%

00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:47,532
'cause they're all
convertible notes.

00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:48,600
Yeah, but you know
what I'm saying.

00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,202
And so after
the first round, 67%.

00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:52,337
How much are you trying
to raise in total?

00:37:52,337 --> 00:37:54,372
I am trying to raise
about $1 million.
Okay.

00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:56,374
What you're really here for
is strictly cash?

00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:58,176
‐No, not at all.
‐Nah.

00:37:58,176 --> 00:37:59,177
What else?
Not at all.

00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:00,278
I have plenty of cash,
actually,

00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,546
and I have plenty of interest
from this round.

00:38:01,546 --> 00:38:04,015
I'd like to know
what's at stake here for you

00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:05,183
if you don't get a deal.

00:38:05,183 --> 00:38:06,451
I believe what ‐‐
being here,

00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:08,653
partnering with you guys,
adds fuel to the fire

00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:11,356
in no other way I can get
from anybody else.

00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:12,690
This is an incredible
opportunity.

00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:15,560
Sincerely, since the day
the show came on air,

00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,628
if you ask my wife,
my family,

00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,329
this has been
literally my dream.

00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:20,198
I was standing back,
getting ready for this,

00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:21,566
and mind‐blown
that this was happening.

00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:22,700
‐[ Chuckles ]
‐Good for you.

00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,269
‐That's amazing.
‐This has literally
been my dream.

00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:25,737
I never had my own idea,
and then I had a great idea,

00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:28,173
and I came here.
Oza: What's to stop Popchips ‐‐

00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:29,541
great brand name,
well‐known ‐‐

00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:31,442
saying, "Hey, we're gonna launch
an ancient grain line"?

00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:34,212
This is about perseverance
and execution

00:38:34,212 --> 00:38:35,380
in the branding
and food space.

00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,248
Every single brand
I've ever worked on,

00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:38,383
I've had success on.

00:38:38,383 --> 00:38:40,218
I haven't had
one failure to date.

00:38:40,218 --> 00:38:41,586
I'm gonna do
the same thing here.

00:38:41,586 --> 00:38:44,322
Dustin,
I believe your real gift

00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,224
is you're one hell
of a salesman.

00:38:46,224 --> 00:38:47,525
Thank you.
And you look the part.

00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:50,195
You look like you're
an ancient grain man, you know?

00:38:50,195 --> 00:38:51,496
Okay.
[ Laughs ]

00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:53,498
So I like
the whole imaging, okay?
Thank you.

00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,700
But there's not a thing I feel
I could do for this business.

00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,369
And I like to feel like
I make a difference

00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:00,205
in anything I step into.

00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:02,473
So, my congratulations,
but I'm out.

00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:04,576
I'm very, very sorry
to hear that.

00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:05,743
You were one of the Sharks
who I think

00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:08,413
could actually add a lot of
value to my business.

00:39:08,413 --> 00:39:10,648
Dustin, let me jump in.
Look.
Yeah.

00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:13,585
You are a good salesperson,
but you oversell.

00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:17,622
You didn't talk about what your
challenges were going to be.

00:39:17,622 --> 00:39:20,491
It was like you were trying to
pitch us why we need <i>you.</i>

00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:23,661
Right? Just sometimes,
you got to stop selling and say,

00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:24,796
"Look, here's where
you can help me,"

00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:27,498
because that's where
true confidence comes through.

00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:30,768
Seems like a great product,
but for those reasons, I'm out.

00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:34,606
Appreciate the feedback.
It's good feedback. Thank you.
You're welcome.

00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:36,241
I would hire you,
by the way.

00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:37,275
I kind of disagree
a little bit

00:39:37,275 --> 00:39:38,509
with my fellow Sharks
on the other end.

00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:39,611
Uh...
I'll take you up on that
one day.

00:39:39,611 --> 00:39:41,646
If this thing doesn't pan out,
just come to me.

00:39:41,646 --> 00:39:43,381
I'm telling you,
I would put you in

00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,649
to run any one
of my companies.

00:39:44,649 --> 00:39:47,418
So, you know, obviously,
I'm in the snack business.

00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:48,753
It's not an easy business.

00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:52,290
So, my problem is,
you're very early.

00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:54,392
Margins are good,
but this industry

00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,760
has crushing trade spend

00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,196
that will just
jam your margins down.

00:39:58,196 --> 00:39:58,863
And as you scale up,

00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:01,699
you're gonna have to manpower
up, et cetera, et cetera.

00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:04,702
And while I like you
and I'll take you anywhere,

00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:07,472
I'm concerned
the journey is too arduous.

00:40:07,472 --> 00:40:11,009
So, unfortunately, I'm out.

00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:13,444
That's very sad
to hear.

00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:17,315
Greiner: I like the product.
I am your market.

00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:19,784
The thing is,
I kind of like jumping in

00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:22,687
where I know that I can
really help people,

00:40:22,687 --> 00:40:24,422
and I think you've got a lot

00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,457
of people with you
that can do that.

00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:28,393
So, I'm sorry, I'm out.

00:40:28,393 --> 00:40:29,928
That's crushing.

00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:32,230
You've heard all the other
Sharks talk about the risks.

00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,498
I get all that.

00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:36,668
I don't have ancient grains
in my portfolio right now.

00:40:36,668 --> 00:40:38,503
[ Laughter ]
So, it's interesting.

00:40:38,503 --> 00:40:41,372
But there's risk
and there's reward, all right?
Of course.

00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:44,642
5%, I don't even
get out of bed for,

00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:46,844
because I know with certainty
I have to participate

00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:51,382
in every round after that
to keep this tiny position,

00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:52,750
regardless of
what the valuation is.

00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,787
The only way I would do this
is turn back time.

00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:59,524
I'd give you the $350,000,
I want 17.5%.

00:40:59,524 --> 00:41:00,992
That's a $2 million
valuation.

00:41:00,992 --> 00:41:05,530
'Cause otherwise, I'm just gonna
get diluted into oblivion

00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:08,299
because you're gonna have to
raise so much money.

00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:08,967
The bottom‐line value

00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,702
that we've talked about
as a company for this round

00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:12,570
has been $5 million
from a cap perspective.

00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,272
I don't want to screw you up
on that,

00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:16,341
but when you say
you have a Shark

00:41:16,341 --> 00:41:17,542
and it's Mr. Wonderful,

00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:19,544
there's Sharks,
and then there's...

00:41:19,544 --> 00:41:21,479
[Vocalizes]
Mr. Wonderful.

00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,282
What about $500,000
for 10%?

00:41:24,282 --> 00:41:25,850
No. No.

00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,486
You know, you're stuck
at that $5 million. I get it.

00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,421
I understand your problem.

00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:32,423
Our universes are not aligned.

00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:33,524
I'm a superhero, too,

00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:34,525
and we're flying around
different planets.

00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:35,593
[ Laughter ]
"I'm a superhero."

00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:37,528
Mr. Wonderful!

00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:38,629
Tell you what,
I'll arm‐wrestle you

00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,665
for my valuation,
and we'll see who wins.

00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:43,434
I think you'd win.
Greiner:
Oh, go for it! Do it!

00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:44,535
It's gonna be heartbreaking

00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:45,770
to walk out of here
without something.

00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,105
Dustin, we are miles apart,
and there's no middle ground.

00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:49,874
That's the problem.
The lowest I think I can go
from a valuation,

00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:52,677
to be fair and equitable
to everyone, is $4 million.

00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:54,512
I don't think I can go
lower than that.

00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,647
It's 100% more than
what I'm willing to pay.
Yep.

00:41:56,647 --> 00:42:00,585
Sometimes the valuation gap
is too large.

00:42:00,585 --> 00:42:02,520
I'm a Shark.

00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,255
You are.

00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:05,356
I do Shark deals.

00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,724
So do I ‐‐
except now, I guess.

00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:08,393
[ Laughter ]
‐Dustin.
‐And you will.

00:42:08,393 --> 00:42:09,560
You know what?
You will.

00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,862
‐Dustin, thank you very much.
‐Thank you. Thank you.

00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,530
Cuban: Good luck.
Congratulations, Dustin.
Appreciate it. Thanks, guys.

00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,598
‐Good luck, Dustin.
‐Take care.
‐Great job.

00:42:13,598 --> 00:42:15,700
He'll be fine.
He's rock‐solid.

00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,468
Finkel: We didn't get a deal,

00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:18,603
but the Sharks
loved the product,

00:42:18,603 --> 00:42:20,405
and that's a home run
in my book.

00:42:20,405 --> 00:42:21,572
We're gonna keep going,

00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:23,474
and we're gonna show everyone
what Ka‐Pop! can be,

00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:24,509
and we're gonna be everywhere

00:42:24,509 --> 00:42:26,010
you want a great, healthy,
salty snack.
