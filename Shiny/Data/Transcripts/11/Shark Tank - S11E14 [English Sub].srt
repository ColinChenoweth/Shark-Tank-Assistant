what I look at

significantly less,

impervious to competition.

a lot of knock‐offs.

that the most successful people

on the fence about this.

about health and fitness.

00:27:25,952 --> 00:27:28,154
I was always obsessed with
creating healthy alternatives

00:27:28,154 --> 00:27:31,057
to everything that I loved,
the sweets that I missed.

00:27:31,057 --> 00:27:33,693
And, you know, so I was just
doing it in my home kitchen,

00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,328
and I realized there was
a business to it,

00:27:35,328 --> 00:27:39,198
so thought of the name, and so
I created this icicle tricycle.

00:27:39,198 --> 00:27:42,035
So, every weekend,
I would go to fitness events.

00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,903
So, when a grocery store
approached me

00:27:43,903 --> 00:27:45,772
and asked if I did
wholesale, I lied.

00:27:45,772 --> 00:27:46,906
I said,
"Yeah, I do wholesale."

00:27:46,906 --> 00:27:48,041
That's always
the right answer.

00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,208
So I, you know,
went online,

00:27:49,208 --> 00:27:51,978
and I figured out how to do
barcodes, nutrition labels.

00:27:51,978 --> 00:27:55,581
I just learned on my own
and figured it out.

the green light

and Arizona.

00:28:04,023 --> 00:28:06,025
And I just got picked up
by one of the biggest

00:28:06,025 --> 00:28:08,261

as of last week.

00:28:08,261 --> 00:28:11,030
What do you sell it for, and
what does it cost you to make?

00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:14,801
So, they retail for $4.99,
up to $5.49.

00:28:14,801 --> 00:28:15,935
Is that expensive?

00:28:15,935 --> 00:28:17,136

launched a dairy‐free product,

to match mine at $5.49.

How do you distribute this?
It's, like, a frozen product.

00:28:44,063 --> 00:28:46,032

we were direct distributor

picked up by UNFI.

So now, they pick up
from my facility,

and that's the reason why we're
now getting the green light

that has 80% share.

dominant player with 80% share.

they knock it off

like a cockroach.

in a market that has
an 80% share behemoth in it?

00:35:09,648 --> 00:35:12,351
Something that's unique about
the eyewear industry

00:35:12,351 --> 00:35:15,354
is that these behemoths don't
actually innovate at all.

00:35:15,354 --> 00:35:17,356
I agree.
They wait for you to do it.

00:35:17,356 --> 00:35:19,058

00:35:26,632 --> 00:35:29,201
So, we began by bootstrapping
the business

00:35:29,201 --> 00:35:30,336
while we were
in college.

00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,338
We had to reach out
to some family and friends

00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,073
to get
some prototypes made.

00:35:34,073 --> 00:35:36,041
We raised $150,000.

00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:37,409
Congrats. Then what?

00:35:37,409 --> 00:35:40,379
We beta tested with
around 75 families

00:35:40,379 --> 00:35:42,481
to get feedback
on how the product worked,

00:35:42,481 --> 00:35:44,150
how the frames worked
for kids...

00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,217
‐Great.
‐That's great.

00:35:45,217 --> 00:35:46,719
...and that's when we began
to think about

00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:50,089
how we would launch this brand,
how would we go to market.

00:35:50,089 --> 00:35:51,223
Did you raise more money?

00:35:51,223 --> 00:35:53,325
We raised $1 million
at that time...

00:35:53,325 --> 00:35:55,394
‐Wow.
‐...at a $4 million valuation.

00:35:55,394 --> 00:35:57,296
And then the million
you raised,

00:35:57,296 --> 00:35:59,431
was it from big
equity firms or individuals?

00:35:59,431 --> 00:36:02,368
It was from a couple
of venture capital firms.

00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:05,771
You know, nobody's asked you
if you have any sales.

00:36:05,771 --> 00:36:09,475

How many actual customers
did you have?

Last month was
$15,000 in sales.

15? One‐five?

00:36:18,317 --> 00:36:19,585
‐Yes, $15,000.
‐That's horrible.

00:36:19,585 --> 00:36:22,521
So, we basically used
the marketing spend

00:36:22,521 --> 00:36:25,691

So, a third of that million was
spent on product development,

00:36:38,537 --> 00:36:40,406
a third was operations,
