and I am seeking $300,000

00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,003
in exchange
for 5% of my company...

00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,272
Wow.
...Swimply.

00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:01,107
Global warming.

00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:02,408
Am I right, Sharks?

00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,210
It's an epidemic
that is sweeping our planet.

00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,978
The global surface temperature
is increasing

00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:08,247
by over 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit
across the board,

00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,549
and it's only going to
get hotter.

00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:11,851
What if I told you
that I had a solution?

00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,886
Introducing...

00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:14,987
Swimply.

00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:16,823
[ Laughter ]

00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:17,890
Corcoran: My God.

00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,192
It's him?!
[ Laughs ]

00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,961
Well, Sharks, maybe I haven't
found a solution

00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,429
for global warming just yet.

00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,498
But I did find an amazing way
for all of us to get together

00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:27,400
and make the world
just a little bit cooler.

00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,235
Swimply is the first‐of‐its‐kind
online marketplace

00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,470
for pool sharing,

00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,105
where anyone can book
their own private pool

00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:34,307
by the hour
whenever they want

00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:37,477
from people who own a pool
but don't use it too often.

00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:38,945
So, say you're like
my good friend Jesse.

00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:40,213
Jesse's like most Americans

00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,581
and can't afford
his own private pool.

00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,750
All he has to do is visit
our website or app,

00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,018
find a pool, lock it in,

00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:47,587
and just like that,

00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:49,822
Jesse's booked himself
the perfect poolside day,

00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:52,392
and pool owners can now monetize
their pool's downtime,

00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,493
even make a profit.

00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:54,927
Swimply is quite literally

00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,429
throwing the biggest pool party
the world has ever known,

00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:57,897
and you're all invited.
[ Laughs ]

00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,799
Which one of you will be
the first to jump in?

00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,067
I'm not getting in
with that guy.

00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,035
Wait, is this
really for real?

00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,104
It's for real.
He's happy!

00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:08,074
Basically, you're like
Airbnb for pools.

00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:10,543
Exactly.
So, is the app alive
on the App Store?

00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:12,979
The app's alive.
So, how many downloads
do you have,

00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:14,747
how many users,
how much revenue?
Okay.

00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,115
And how many pools
do you have?

00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,451
And who in the world thought
this was a good idea?

00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:19,719
I'm ‐‐ Me. So ‐‐

00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:21,721
[ Laughter ]

00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:22,855
The story behind Swimply

00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,157
is actually a personal solution
for me.

00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:26,159
My next‐door neighbor built
a pool for her grandkids,

00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,460
and they didn't show up as much

00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,295
as maybe
the grandmother supposed,

00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:30,463
and the pool was always empty.

00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:32,165
I sort of asked her
if it would be okay

00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:33,733
if my family used their pool.

00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:35,735
Very consciously aware
of the amount of money
she recently put into it,

00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:37,937
she asked me if it would be okay
if my family helped her out.

00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,071
‐Oh.
‐We worked out a deal.

00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:41,140
We helped her pay
25% of her expenses,

00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,942
and in exchange,
my family used her pool.

00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,610
Before long, our entire block
was using the pool,

00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,479
and I wanted to bring this
to as many people as possible.

00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:49,382
I thought it was crazy when
you walked in here with this,

00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:52,285
but now that I listen to
the story of how it occurred...

00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,386
It's crazy.

00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:54,921
What's happened?
So, tell us.

00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:56,088
So, I put together
my bar mitzvah money,

00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,623
and I launched a small website.

00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,991
I went on Google Earth.

00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,661
I found 80 people that had pools
and knocked on 80 of them.

00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:02,695
Good for you
for doing that.

00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:03,963
76 said "no,"

00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,231
but we got our first "yeah."
[ Laughs ]

00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:06,666
‐Yeah.
‐So, we got our first
four yeses,

00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,568
and our four pools
quickly escalated to 32.

00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,837
I raised 30 grand
to launch an MVP.

00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:12,672
I spent the whole 30 grand
on the website,

00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:14,240
just hiring a developer
and a designer.

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,175
So, wait. How much bar mitzvah
money did you burn initially?

00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,577
10 grand.
Okay.

00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,612
But initially, I raised 30 grand
to make the site not crash.

00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:21,013
So, I launched with Swimply,
and immediately,

00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:23,049
we did around 900 hours' worth
of reservations.

00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:25,384
Bunim, I'm worried you're going
to spontaneously combust.

00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,553
Slow down.
No, I want to see
how much faster you can talk.

00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,455
You said 900 hours?
Laskin: 900 hours were booked.

00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,524
So, we get our first 100 pools,
then the website.

00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:34,260
I didn't really have the funds
to keep the operation going.

00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:38,598
I spent that summer using that
beta to just raise 960 grand.

00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:39,899
Greiner: Whoa! Whoa!
960 grand?!
O'Leary: What?!

00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:40,900
What?
So, a million in total?

00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,901
‐You raised $960,000?
‐Yeah.

00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:43,569
Wow!
O'Leary: What?

00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,571
How much of the company
did you have to sell
to raise that much?
Mazel tov!

00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:46,806
‐[ Laughs ]
‐How did you do that?

00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:48,140
I raised it
at a $6 million valuation.

00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,475
How did you do that?
Wow.

00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,677
A pool‐maintenance partnership
reached out to us, and ‐‐

00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,479
Pool‐maintenance partnership?
A pool‐maintenance company?

00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,014
How interesting.
A pool‐maintenance company that
has stores all over the country.

00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,283
What have you booked
in hours, year‐to‐date?

00:16:57,283 --> 00:17:00,887
In March 2019,
I raised 960 grand.

00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:01,921
First thing we had to do
was develop

00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:03,356
a proper website
that would scale.

00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,490
So, this is your third time

00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,158
trying to develop a proper
website, but go ahead.

00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,360
This is really the first.

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,461
The first two times
were really a...

00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:09,695
Yeah.
Yeah,
but they still count.

00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,664
That was still 40 grand,
but go ahead.
Yeah. Okay.

00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:13,699
We tried to build this app
and this website in three months

00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,101
to get it out there
in time for summer.

00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:16,936
To date,
there were malfunctions.

00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:18,571
We got the product out there ‐‐
Corcoran: Would you take
a minute?

00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:19,839
I just have to take a breath.
[ Inhales sharply ]

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,007
Okay, go ahead.

00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:22,775
[ Breathes sharply ]
So, this year to date,

00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,810
we booked
individual 1,600 hours.

00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,846
Greiner: So, that's a lot.
Herjavec: Can you walk us
through the financial model?

00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:28,648
Laskin: Sure.
How much do you make,

00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:29,682
what does the pool owner
charge?

00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:30,850
Walk us through that.
Sure.

00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,151
So, at the moment,
we let our host

00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,286
charge whatever they'd like,

00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:34,954
and then the hosts set limits.

00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:37,290
So, some will have a 5% limit,
some will have a 25% limit,

00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,925
and then they can set
additional fees

00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:40,626
for every person
after a certain amount.

00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,194
And how do you get paid
from that?

00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,463
We have
a double‐sided business model.

00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:45,998
We take 15% commission
from the host,

00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:48,000
and we charge the swimmer
an additional 10% service fee.

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,169
So 25% total?
25% total.

00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,505
And how much have you made
year‐to‐date?

00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:54,907
We did around $215,000 worth
of marketplace revenue.

00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,676
That's net to you?
That's gross.
No, that's gross.

00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:57,877
That's gross
marketplace revenue.

00:17:57,877 --> 00:18:00,313
Our net
is around 20% of that.

00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:03,182
So, you've made
$42,000 net revenue?
So, what's your dollar net?

00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,084
Yes.
This is incredible.

00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,620
You raised $1 million
for this idea.

00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,854
Yeah.
That's very impressive.

00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,656
Is that why you priced
the stock so very high?

00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:13,092
Because based on your revenue,
it makes no sense.

00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,760
So, it's a game of scale
and it's a game of promise

00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,828
and it's a game of vision
right?

00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:16,963
And that's exactly
what we're doing.

00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:18,064
It's also a game of money.

00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:19,265
Right.

00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,701
Let me tell you
my thoughts, okay?
Okay.

00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:22,802
I fly a lot,

00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:25,404
and in the summer months,
when you fly over,

00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:28,240
you will see pool after pool
after pool, and they're empty.

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,743
All these people own pools,
and there's nobody ever in them.

00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:33,346
So I think that, in some ways,
you're really onto something,

00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:37,016
but I just don't know
if I want to invest in this,

00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:38,651
even though I think
there's a need.

00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:40,052
So I'm sorry, I'm out.

00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:41,621
Okay. Totally.

00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,322
I have a couple of pragmatic
questions, alright?

00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,057
When people show up, where do
they go to the bathroom?

00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:47,159
When it comes to bathrooms,
hosts have two options.

00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:48,861
Well ‐‐
The two options they have ‐‐

00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,796
The people renting have
a third option ‐‐ they
just pee in the pool.

00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,232
Right now, 50% of our pools do
offer a way to use a side door.

00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,334
But, Bunim, what's the second
option for bathrooms?

00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:56,435
The second option
is not offering one.

00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:57,470
But if you don't offer one,

00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,871
aren't people gonna pee
in the pool?

00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,172
I think Jesse's peeing
in the pool right now.

00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,141
But they are. But ‐‐
[ Laughter ]

00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,643
I don't think
you've given a sense

00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:06,245
of what someone's willing
to pay to use that pool.
Right.

00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:07,647
And how many people
are paying?
Set us a range.

00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,348
So, there's ‐‐ Right.
Corcoran: And if I ‐‐

00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:10,616
So, I guess now
is a good time ‐‐
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,284
And if I can couple
a second part of that question,

00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,053
do your customers
typically come back

00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:15,755
and reuse the pool
once a week,

00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:17,523
or is it
a one‐time event?

00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:20,693
Okay, last year, the average
hour booked was $45 an hour.

00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:22,294
This year,
the average was $90 an hour.

00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,630
And how many people book it
for 100 bucks an hour?

00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,732
Like, is there five
people coming over,
three people, two people?

00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,067
So, last year, the average
amount of people per booking

Together: Who's ready to suit up
and take this journey with us?

00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:53,519
[ Chuckles ]

00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:55,320
My little carbon copies
will now disembark.

00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,356
Okay.
Nice job, guys.

00:25:57,356 --> 00:25:59,191
Cuban: Good job, guys.
Way to fight.
Greiner: Good job.

00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:00,692
Boy: Goodbye.

00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:04,396
O'Leary: Okay, so, does this in
any way impede the seat belt?

00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,731
Can you still use the unit?

00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:06,832
Yes.
Yes.

00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:09,601
We have seatbelt‐access
slots here,

00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:11,336
sized to fit the seat belt.

00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:13,238
So, a child can use it
without a booster,

00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,240
just by itself,
like Margaret was doing.

00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,443
You could use
the car seat, also,

00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:20,179
and it has
latch‐access spaces,

00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:22,114
so you could slide the latch
in there, as well.

00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:24,016
You can use the seat belt
or the latch system.

00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:26,585
I have a question.
How did you come up with this?

00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,421
So, last summer,
we were about to take a trip,

00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,523
and the kids were going to be
on the bench seat,

00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:33,725
and I thought, "Well,
how am I going to
keep them separated?

00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:36,395
There is just no way
that I'm going to take this,

00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:39,264
you know, journey
with these kids fighting."

00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,733
So, I thought,
"Let's start

00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:44,002
with a collapsible
laundry hamper."

00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:45,204
We have a photo.

00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:47,673
We have a photo,
a collapsible laundry hamper.

00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:49,608
Oh, my ‐‐
[ Laughter ]

00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:50,976
That's pretty good.

00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:53,545
So, the kids loved it,
and I thought,

00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:56,248
"Okay, the laundry hampers
worked okay.

00:26:56,248 --> 00:27:00,252
But let's try
a collapsible dog kennel."

00:27:01,587 --> 00:27:04,623
[ Laughter ]

00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,658
So, after that trip,
I called Rachel,

00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:09,294
I was like,
"We have the best idea."
You're onto something.

00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,697
And that's how
The Space Traveler was born.
Yes.

00:27:11,697 --> 00:27:13,565
My daughter, Alyssa,
and my son, Jake,

00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:15,501
they just go at it
like cats and dogs, right?

00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:18,337
But I can see them
weaponizing it, you know...
Yes.

00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:19,505
...where, hitting through it,

00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:20,873
like they think
they have protection.

00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:22,040
Right.
I mean ‐‐

00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,642
We believe if you
separate them visually,

00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,577
it does a lot for also
separating them physically.

00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:27,212
And you don't have to put it
for all three kids.

00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:28,814
You just have to separate
the middle one?

00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:31,016
Unfortunately, they
actually will start fighting

00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:33,385
about who gets to ride
in The Space Traveler.
Ah, that's a good sign.

00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:35,454
And then it does fold down,
like all the others do?

00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:36,822
‐It collapses, yes.
‐Yeah, it's collapsible.
‐It just twists down flat.

00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:38,423
Yes. Yes.
Let's show you.

00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:40,726
Cuban: Oh, there you go.
So, that twists around.

00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:41,793
Herjavec: That's clever.
Right here.

00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:42,828
That's great.

00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:44,196
Krissy, what do you charge
for it?

00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:46,765
So, right now,
we have two prototypes.

00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:48,400
Uh‐oh!
O'Leary: That's it?

00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,568
Ohhhh!

00:27:49,568 --> 00:27:51,870
We're pre‐revenue?

00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,305
Yes.                   Yes.

00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:56,775
Tell us what you think you'll
charge for this one for car use.

00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:59,778
We were thinking
about $29.99.
Yes.

00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:01,513
And what do you think
it'll cost you to make?

00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,715
About $17 to $18.
$17 to $18.

00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:04,583
Cuban:
Oh, that's expensive.
Wow.

00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:05,584
$17?

00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:07,019
Yes.                        Yes.

00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:10,556
So, guys,
what's your background?

00:28:10,556 --> 00:28:12,357
We are both mothers,
first and foremost.

00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,825
Yes.

00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:16,495
Krissy started coming up with
the ideas about 10 years ago.

00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:17,796
Yes. So ‐‐

00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:19,298
Krissy, you had this
10 years ago?

00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:20,666
No.
So, about 10 years ago,

00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:21,800
when I became a mother,

00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,835
I would find a need
for a product.

00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:26,004
So, I started to design...
Her own products.

00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,272
...my own products,

00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:28,774
and Rachel would kind of
help me tweak it a little bit.

00:28:28,774 --> 00:28:31,043
Oh.
And you've sold some?

00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:33,078
So, we've had
some amazing designs,

00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:34,213
and we've pitched them

00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:36,081
to a couple companies
up in New York.

00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:38,050
You know, they said
they loved the product,

00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,251
but, you know,
didn't want to ‐‐

00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:40,953
They wanted you
to pay how much?

00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:42,921
They wanted you to put up,
like, $25,000 for it?

00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:44,523
No. So ‐‐
Well, actually, they said

00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:46,058
they weren't interested
in the product.
They weren't interested.

00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:47,893
So, about a year later,

00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:50,929
I went into
a major box store,

00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:53,265
and I saw my product.

00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:54,333
No!
Yes.

00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:55,634
Did you litigate?

00:28:55,634 --> 00:28:57,302
But the best part of the story
is, we did it again!

00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:59,071
Yes.
We sent them a sample!

00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,372
It was like a toxic
relationship.
Greiner: No.

00:29:00,372 --> 00:29:01,573
We didn't know.
Yes!

00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,741
‐No way.
‐Yes.
‐Yes.

00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:03,842
What did you send them?

00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:06,144
We sent our next idea.
Which was a nap mat.

00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:08,046
It's a nap mat
that rolls into a pillow.
Yes.

00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:09,781
And it looks
like a stuffed animal.

00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:10,882
And it looked like
a stuffed animal.

00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:12,417
And we actually sent them
the sample.

00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,219
Why?
And what happened?

00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,154
I think you need to
stop sending things.
Well, we learned
our lesson.

00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:18,790
So, Krissy, Rachel, I want to
thank you for coming today.

00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,292
You can leave.
We'll knock it off.

00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:21,793
[ Laughter ]
Perfect!

00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:24,863
But why would you, after they
allegedly stole your idea ‐‐

00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:26,298
why would you send them
another one?

00:29:26,298 --> 00:29:27,966
That's a really good
question.

00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:29,067
[ Laughter ]

00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,535
It is.
It's a really good question.

00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:32,371
We gave them the benefit
of the doubt.
Yes.

00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:34,473
You know, people
have great ideas ‐‐
Well, that's more
than a benefit.

00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,142
Alright,
I have to tell you, I ‐‐

00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:38,844
I love your guys' story.

00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:41,647
I thought it was
a very good presentation.

[ Smacks lips ]
I don't like this product.

00:29:43,415 --> 00:29:44,850
Okay.
I'm sorry.

00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:48,620

other nuts hitting each other.

of The Space Traveler

for licensing ‐‐
character licensing.
Character licensing.

00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:59,531
Possibly making it
look like a police car

that's a cute idea.

I mean, you guys
obviously are creative.

00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,139
Your presentation was adorable.

00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,574
The problem for me
as an investor,

00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:12,144
you're so new, it's a prototype.
Mm‐hmm.

00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,712
You've not had any sales

00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:16,448

from the public.

We appreciate that.

And it looks just like
their product.

00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:29,027
The challenge is,
there's patents on
a lot of pieces there.

00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,896
Yes.
Have you done
patent searches

00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:33,432
to make sure you don't conflict
with any existing patents?

00:30:33,432 --> 00:30:34,866
Not yet.
No.

00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:37,369
We have a provisional patent
on it in place.
In place.

00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:38,570
I think it'd be a conflict.

00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:39,638
So, for those reasons, I'm out.

send it to the guys
that ripped you off.

a stupid product

And I didn't get the product,
but I liked the guys...
Uh‐huh.

...and nobody wanted to invest,
there was no proven sales.

didn't like it, I love it.

gonna sell a ton of these,

but I have to make money
right away.

what you asked ‐‐

$100,000 for 33 1/3%,

but I want a royalty of $2
for every sale,

00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,898
but the royalty goes away

00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,100
the minute I recoup
my investment.
