00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:56,909
we're gonna donate one
to the homeless community.

00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:59,679
We have been giving socks
to the Bowery Mission

00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:02,682
since we started this company,
and we couldn't be more excited

00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:05,018
to have our T‐shirt
donation event with them.

00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:06,686
What size would you like?
Medium.

00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:07,820
Medium?

00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,789
Goldberg: The Bombas
donation T‐shirt is built

00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,825
to meet the needs of people who
are experiencing homelessness.

00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,093
It's extra durable,

00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:17,363
it has reinforced seams
and an anti‐microbial treatment

00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,399
so it stays fresh longer
between washes.

00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,933
John: Man, you don't need
an extra large.

00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:22,068
You need a large
like me, man.

00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:23,770
You're the same size
as me, brother.

00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,872
John: It's absolutely amazing
to be here in the community

00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:27,540
and seeing the people
one‐on‐one

00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,309
and pressing the palms to them
and talking to them.

00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,777
John: How you doing, man?
Man: Hey!

00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:31,944
What's happening?
How you doing?

00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:33,646
This is not about
checkbook philanthropy.

00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,014
This is rolling up your sleeves

00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:37,350
and being able to meet the ones
that you are serving.

00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,951
Nice to meet you.

00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:41,821
Heath:
It's always so inspiring
to keep doing events like this,

00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,189
giving back
to the community,

00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,925
as it reminds us
why we do what we do.

00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,327
You always make it good
when you come.

00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:48,594
You always make it good.

00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:51,064
John: This has been such
a unique investment for me.

00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:53,132
I've learned so much
about a social cause.

00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:54,967
I've learned about giving
to a community

00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,602
and making sure
that it's infectious

00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,404
for other people
who want to give, as well.

00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:01,174
It is absolutely amazing,
and I'm proud to be part of it.

Hi.
My name is Nadine Habayeb.

00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:29,502
I live in Boston, Massachusetts,

00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:34,574
and I'm here seeking $200,000
for 10% of our company, Bohana.

00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:36,309
Sharks, like many Americans,

00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,911
popcorn was one
of my favorite snacks ‐‐

00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:41,748
until I discovered
something better.

00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,816
I'd like to introduce you
to Bohana,

00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,818
a delicious and nutritious snack

00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:48,621
made out of
popped water lily seeds.

00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:51,591
You heard me right ‐‐
seeds of a water lily plant.

00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,259
Not those small lily pads

00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,395
that you see floating on ponds
here in the U. S.,

00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:59,031
but a giant variety that are
native to the north of India.

00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:02,502
These plants produce seeds,
and when roasted over high heat,

00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:04,570
they pop
right out of their shell ‐‐

00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,340
just like popcorn, but better,

00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,443
because popped water lily seeds
contain 50% more protein,

00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:12,311
fewer calories and fat,

00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,647
and my favorite part ‐‐
no kernel,

00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,282
so nothing to get stuck
in your teeth.

00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:17,450
Damn.
Wow.

00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,185
When my co‐founder, Priyal,
introduced me

00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:20,286
to these beautiful seeds,

00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,188
I quickly said goodbye
to popcorn

00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:24,157
and hello
to my new favorite snack.

00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:26,092
Now, Priyal
can't be with us today

00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,428
because she, too,
is about to pop.

00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,263
[ Laughter ]

00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,631
Priyal grew up in India,

00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:34,066
where they've been eating
water lily seeds for centuries,

00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:35,835
and today,
they're one of the world's

00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:37,570
fastest‐growing ingredients.

00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,939
And I can't wait
for you to try some.

00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,209
So, who wants to get in on this
wildly fast‐moving food trend

00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:46,679
and help bring Bohana
to snackers all across America?

00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,814
Me.
Dying to try.

00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:49,248
Let's try some.
Yes. Please do.

00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,117
Tell us what we're trying here.
Tell us what we're trying.

00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,785
Habayeb:
So, on my right, your left,

00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,554
you have
our Himalayan pink salt.

00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:57,223
I like starting with this one
because it's a great way

00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:59,659
to taste the intrinsic flavor
of the seed itself.

00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:01,394
The middle one
is our white cheddar.

00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:02,829
This is
our most popular flavor,

00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:05,131
and it's
our only non‐vegan flavor.
Wow. That's pretty good.

00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:08,301
And our Soulful Spice
is the bright‐red one,

00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,236
which has a little bit
of a kick to it.

00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:13,105
It's very similar
to puffed rice.

00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,775
Yes. Yes.
To me.
I mean, in taste.

00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:18,211
It's lighter than popcorn,
tastier than popcorn...

00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:19,912
It's very good.
...and airy as could be.

00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,113
It's delicious.

00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,583
The question is,
is the taste profile there?

00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,151
Would you trade this
for popcorn?

00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,285
I would.

00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,421
So, there is a bit
of an intrinsic taste.

00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:29,889
You know,
it's a water seed.

00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:32,158
It has a smokiness that's quite
natural to the seed itself.

00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,327
They have all nine
essential amino acids,

00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,529
and that's very rare to find
in a plant‐based food,

00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,965
is really what
makes this very special.

00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:41,834
Do I have to worry about
a huge educational process

00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,169
with the snacking public?

00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,905
Yes. We know this is something
that we are pioneering.

00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:47,173
We are the first people

00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:49,275
to be bringing water lily seeds
to the U. S.

00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:51,544
The "Aha" moment
is when people try this product.

00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:53,346
Every single demo
that we've done

00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,648
in stores that we sell in,
we've completely sold out

00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:57,383
of every single bag
that we sell in‐store.

00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:58,484
Really?

00:16:58,484 --> 00:16:59,952
But they don't even know
what this is, right?

00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:02,288
But when they taste it, they're
willing to make that change.

00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:05,658
So, the familiarity
and similarity to popcorn

00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:07,393
is what's really helpful
for someone.

00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:08,594
So, what do you
sell these for?

00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:10,329
Is this the same price
as a popcorn bag?

00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,697
Habayeb: It's more expensive
than popcorn.

00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,698
By how much?

00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,100
So, it's...
Twice the price.

00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,201
...almost twice as much.

00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,436
It's $3.99
for a bag of ‐‐

00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:19,238
Whoa!
$3.99 this bag?

00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,706
Nadine, that's
a lot of money.

00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,441
But this is
actually the same price

00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,377
as all the other snacks
on the shelf that it lives with.

00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,746
So, you will not actually
find this on a shelf

00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:28,548
where you see popcorn
or potato chips.

00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,616
You're gonna see this where you
find your better‐for‐you,

00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:33,519
alternative‐ingredient snacks,
not processed, not extruded.

00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,854
What does "extrude" mean?

00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:37,924
Extruded is when you
reconstitute a flour

00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:39,825
into the shape of a ‐‐
O'Leary:
What I like about you ‐‐

00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,527
we're hitting you hard,
and you keep coming back.

00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:44,030
She's got the answers.
You know your stuff,
Nadine.

00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:47,667
I'm the person who buys
all of the snack things

00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:51,137
that are, like, high protein
and low fat and low sodium.

00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:52,538
So, when I look at this,

00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:56,375
the only thing that's missing
for me here is fiber.

00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,277
Habayeb: Sure.
Can you add fiber to it?

00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,479
Have you been thinking
of adding fiber to it?
Totally.

00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,181
So, one of the really
interesting things

00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,617
about the seed itself ‐‐ when
you grind that down to a flour,

00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:08,187
it does extrude, so we <i>can</i> play
with the nutrient density,

00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:11,524
we can combine higher protein,
higher fiber.

00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:14,060
Nadine, tell us a little
bit more about yourself.
Sure, sure.

00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,228
You're pretty impressive,
standing in your space there.

00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:17,563
I have a background
in marketing.

00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,131
I used to work
in the fashion industry.

00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,666
I worked for
a French fashion house.

00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,368
Which one?
Yves Saint Laurent.

00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:24,036
Ooh‐la‐la!

00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:25,237
I love that.

00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:27,039
I was actually living
in the Middle East.

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,441
Which city?

00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,977
I lived in Dubai. I was
actually born and raised there.

00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:32,511
So, I'm originally Lebanese.

00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,780
My father
was based in the U.A.E.

00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,682
and in some Gulf countries
for his work,

00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:40,186
and so I was born there,
and that's where I grew up,

00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:41,520
kind of moving in and out,

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,490
and I lived in the U. S.
only when I went to school,

00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,792
actually, for my undergrad,
and then later, my master's.

00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,894
So, you're at the fashion house,
and you were...

00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,197
Yeah, so, then I went back
to do my MBA,

00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:52,298
and so ‐‐
Where?

00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,634
I ended up finishing
at Babson College.

00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,403
We launched
in April in 2019 ‐‐

00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:58,437
'18. Excuse me.

00:18:58,437 --> 00:18:59,805
This is
your first full year?

00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,774
Yes.
So, what have you done
in your first full year?

00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:03,242
'Cause you're
asking for ‐‐
Yeah.

00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,344
...before Kevin gets to it,
might as well beat him to it ‐‐

00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,413
a $2 million valuation.
Yes.

00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:09,448
We've done a revenue
of $123,000.

00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:10,616
Over what period of time?

00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,318
Over the past 16 months.
Okay.

00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:15,321
We've been in retail
for only about nine months,

00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,822
since the beginning
of this year.

00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,258
We spent the first phase really
testing out our market online,

00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:22,528
on Amazon and our website,
some specialty ‐‐

00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,664
Nadine, it's
a lot more expensive,

00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:28,000
and it has kind of a unique
taste that you have to adapt to,

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,869
but it's a slog, right?

00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:33,372
It's not a straight path,
and it's very difficult.

00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:35,241
While the product
was good,

00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:37,643
it's gonna take
some getting used to.

00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:39,512
I just don't get excited
enough about it,

00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,280
so for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:43,883
I'll make you an offer.

00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:47,887
Just like that, Barbara?
Yeah.

00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:49,922

in an internal battery,

00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:14,299
meaning you can charge
your favorite devices

00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,767
day or night.

00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:17,936
And the beautiful bamboo frame

00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:20,806
is designed to blend in
with any type of home decor

00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:23,075
so that you look good
while you're doing

00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:25,444
a little more good
for the environment.

00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:29,047
And, Sharks, this product
is just the beginning

00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:31,383
of what we can do at Grouphug.

00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:34,786
With this same model, we can
create stunning solar panels

00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:37,189
of any shape, size, or pattern

00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:39,558
and take larger appliances
off the grid.

00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:42,628
I truly believe
that the future of solar

00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:45,797
is making it as beautiful
as it is efficient,

00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:48,934
and that's the key to getting
more people to adopt it.

00:27:48,934 --> 00:27:52,037
So, Sharks, who wants
to join this Grouphug

00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:55,207
and change the way
that we get energized?

00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:58,410
Each of you guys has a sample
right in front of you

00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,979
with, hopefully,
your preferred charging cable

00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:04,550
so you can test it out
and charge up right now.

00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:07,052
How did you come up
with the name "Grouphug"?

00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:08,287
With the name "Grouphug" ‐‐

00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:10,856
So, I actually have
seven years of experience

00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:13,091
making consumer electronics.

00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:14,860
I started off as an intern

00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,595
at a tech company in New York
seven years ago.

00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:18,597
Are you an engineer?
I'm not an engineer,

00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:21,400
but I like to say
I'm a creative technologist.

00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,269
So, I'm a little half science,
half art, is how I describe it.

00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:26,705
Which company
did you work for?
The tech startup
was called littleBits.

00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,308
Mr. Wonderful,
it's in the toy space.
Yes, I know it.

00:28:29,308 --> 00:28:31,410
I was
an industrial design intern,

00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,878
and by the time I left,

00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,680
I was senior director
of product design.

00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,248
I didn't want
to work for someone else.

00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:39,184
I knew that I could come up with
something that was worth a lot.

00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:40,419
What's your background?

00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:42,754
So, I'm actually
a first‐generation American.

00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:44,389
My parents are from Guyana.

00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,392
My three older sisters are all
in medicine and healthcare,

00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:50,395
so I've always been kind of
the black sheep of the family,

00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,397
and it's always been a struggle
for me, actually,

00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:55,067
with my parents that I
can actually make money

00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:58,036
and make a living as a designer
and as a creative person.

00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:00,272
How much charge time
do you get,

00:29:00,272 --> 00:29:04,509
and is the intention that
this would just charge devices?

00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:06,745
To talk geeky,
it's a 10‐watt panel.

00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,615
There's a 2,200 milliamp‐hour
battery built inside,

00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:11,617
and then that battery
will charge your phones,

00:29:11,617 --> 00:29:13,752
tablets, bike lights.
Anything small.

00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,687
Anything small,
USB‐related.

00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:17,623
Do you have any idea
how you'll sell this?

00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:19,958
Wait, here's
a better question.

00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,760
No, that's
a very good question.

We don't need
a better question.

Of this year.

00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:31,370
Is this a Kickstarter
or an Indiegogo?

00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,971
Yeah, it started off
as a Kickstarter.

00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:35,707
I have $80,000
in sales so far.

00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:36,708
Wow!

00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:37,943
What were you
aiming for?

00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:40,345
My target on Kickstarter
was $10,000.

00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:41,980
Have you shipped
the 80K yet?

00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,582
Not yet.

00:29:43,582 --> 00:29:44,750
Ooh.

00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,151
What does it cost?
What do you sell it for?

00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,853
The MSRP is $149.

00:29:47,853 --> 00:29:50,756
Right now, it costs me
$42 to make.

00:29:50,756 --> 00:29:52,624
That's at 1,000 units.
How low could you get it
in quantity?

00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:53,925
If you made 10,000,
what would it cost?

00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:56,862
If I made 10,000, the price
would drop closer to $35.

00:29:56,862 --> 00:29:59,965

by hand in your home?

Nice. Now they're making
it for you, basically?
Yeah.

00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:14,112
So, right now, with the factory,
we're working with them

00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,715
to, like, reduce the amount
of exposed hardware,

00:30:16,715 --> 00:30:18,083
clean up a lot of the edges,

00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:20,152

00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:13,404
If I get the rights
to this.

00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:15,840
Oza: If he gets the clacker.
...if he gets the clacker.

00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,410
So, Mark,
if we give him $100,000,

00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:22,413
you're willing to put up
1/3 of that?

00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:23,982
Uh‐huh.
What planet
are we on here?

00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:27,719
50/50 partners,
contingent on a licensing deal.

00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:30,555
We will do our best
to get you a licensing deal

00:41:30,555 --> 00:41:33,224
with a big name,
put it out there everywhere.

00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:35,360
We'll handle the legal,
we'll broker the deal.

00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,961
I appreciate your offer.

00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:38,196
Um...

00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,800
So...

00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,070
33% for that offer.

00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:49,374
We earn 66%, and you guys
are gonna earn 33%.

00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:53,478
So, wait.
Can I take this one home?

00:41:53,478 --> 00:41:54,779
Can I take this home?

00:41:54,779 --> 00:41:56,848
Mark, you can take that one home
if you really want to.

00:41:57,815 --> 00:41:58,950
Done. Deal.

00:41:58,950 --> 00:41:59,951
Done on the clacker.

00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:01,853
Are we done?
Yes.

00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:05,089
How you pulled that out,
buddy, is next‐level.

00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:06,691
[ Laughter ]

00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:08,559
‐God bless. Thank you.
‐Thank you. Brilliant.

00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:09,827
Cuban: Congrats, Drew.

00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:12,030
Yes!

00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,464
So, with three Sharks,

00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:15,233
we're gonna take Safety Nailer
to the next level.

00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:16,334
It's gonna be awesome.

00:42:16,334 --> 00:42:17,769
You know what?
Okay, wait a second.

00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:20,071
He is a really
good guy.
Wait a second, Lori. Lori.

00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:23,574
The only reason that happened is
Cuban wanted to spend 100 grand

00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:26,110
for a clacker
that doesn't clack.
Doesn't clack!
