It acts as
an insect repellent

00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:17,188
and an antimicrobial

00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:18,857
for odor‐causing bacteria
and algae.

00:34:18,857 --> 00:34:22,794
‐So, citric acid with lime?
‐But it's so incredibly safe.

00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:23,762
Mm‐hmm.

00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:25,430
So, I would have
no fear whatsoever

00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,699
to sprinkle
this anywhere?
Right.

00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:29,768
What's with the name
"First Saturday Lime"?

00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:32,904
Jacobs: Well, it's
a once‐a‐month application.
Greiner: Oh.

00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,973
So on the first Saturday
of every month ‐‐

00:34:34,973 --> 00:34:36,641
Repeat customers!

00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:39,311
...we go online
and we remind customers,

00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:42,113
"Hey, this is a perfect time
to re‐lime,"

00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:44,115
and then they can share
their stories and results

00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:45,350
with people.
That's cool.

00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,619
Tell me a little bit
about yourself.

00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:50,322
We are a third generation
in the limestone industry.

00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:52,891
Our father
had the idea for it.

00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:55,226
He's no longer with us,

00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:57,862
but he was working
with universities

00:34:57,862 --> 00:34:59,798
and various co‐ops,

00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:02,133
and he started
this formula.

00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:05,437
And then he passed
nine years ago,

00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:08,974
and Jana and Zac,
they took over the farm,

00:35:08,974 --> 00:35:10,442
they grew the company,

00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,777
and they also made it
sustainable.

00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,780
We built a factory,
and we have just exploded.

00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,149
Farmers in America ‐‐
do they know

00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:20,885
that citric acid is
a common insect repellent?

00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:22,320
Is that widely used?

00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,422
So, lime is
fairly common,

00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:27,025
but what we did was
we created a version of it

00:35:27,025 --> 00:35:29,127
which acts
as this magic formula.

00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,528
Do you have a patent?

00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:33,231
There's patent pending utility
on our factory.

00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:34,532
So, we built a factory ‐‐

00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:35,900
On the factory,
not the product?

00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:39,804
So, it's the secret process
on how to utilize the lime

00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,406
so that it works
in this manner?

00:35:41,406 --> 00:35:42,340
Yes.

00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,441
And how much
does each bag cost?

00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:45,577
The 20‐pound bag
is $19.99.

00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:46,611
What's it cost you
to make?

00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:47,779
$1.60.

00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:48,880
‐Wow.
‐There you go!

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,948
‐Whoa!
‐Yeah, there you go.

00:35:49,948 --> 00:35:52,117
‐I have a question, too.
‐Great margin.

00:35:52,117 --> 00:35:54,352
You got my citric acids
flowing

00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:55,954
when you talked about
those margins,

00:35:55,954 --> 00:35:58,223
and I want to keep talking
about the business.
Ew!

00:35:58,223 --> 00:36:00,558
What are you going to be doing
in annual sales this year

00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:01,726
at that margin?

00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:04,462
This year, we're scheduled
to do $350,000.

00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:05,664
Good for you.

00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:08,667
And next year, based on
our current run rates ‐‐

00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:13,271
so, last month's sales ‐‐
we should do $600,000.

00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:15,440
So, you did $50,000
last month, basically.

00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,176
Yes, but ‐‐
You're basically
selling these bags online?

00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,611
Is it all online,
Jana?

00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:23,615
Right now, our split is
80% online, 20% retail.

00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:27,352
This year, so far,
what are your actual sales?

00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:31,222
This year, our actual sales
are $150,000.

00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:33,558
But you said $350,000.
Those are projections?

Yes,
and that's based on ‐‐

our last two months' rates
are $50,000.

00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:38,596
O'Leary: It's not a lot.

00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:40,432
Are you having a hard time
explaining the benefits
of this product?

00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:41,966
No, it's great.
Are you kidding me?

00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:44,269
‐It's <i>not</i> great.
‐It's nothing.

00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:45,670
Jana: Well,
we signed vendor agreements

00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,772
with larger distributors,

00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:50,241
but we really said,

00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:52,677
"Okay, we need a strategic
partner to go after this."

00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:54,946
What if a child puts it
in their mouth?

00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:56,247
It's absolutely safe.

00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:58,483
This is not to be eaten
by people, correct?

00:36:58,483 --> 00:37:00,018
Right.
Thank you very much.
Correct.

00:37:00,018 --> 00:37:02,587
I can order a bag
for $19.99.

00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:04,222
It costs $1.60 to make.

00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,558
Do you provide free shipping?
Do I pay for the shipping?

00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:08,093
This thing weighs about
10 pounds.

00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:10,028
Jana: We do provide
free shipping.

00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:11,596
What does it cost
to ship it?

00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:13,431
About $10.

based on ‐‐
our volume is so large.

We can get those down.
So we are making it
even lower.

00:37:23,141 --> 00:37:24,642
We believe
in this product.

00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:26,377
We want to create a healthy
alternative for families

00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:27,712
and their homes
and gardens

00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:29,481
so that they can
keep the bugs out.

00:37:29,481 --> 00:37:32,083
I think you guys are coming
from a genuine place,

00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:35,487
but I think you don't know what
you don't know at this point,

00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:37,522
and it's gonna be
an uphill battle.

Thank you so much
for your time, Robert.

Okay, so,
the amount of education

that's gonna be required
to scale this

00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:47,265
to make it a big business
is a formidable amount of work

00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,300
because you've got
to explain

00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,704
why a frog and a Saturday
and a lime

00:37:52,704 --> 00:37:54,439
have anything to do
with each other.

00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,107
That's just not a journey
I want to go on.

00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,776
I wish you the best of luck.

Mark, I know this isn't
necessarily right up your alley,

you're interested in
what we're saying here.

See, look, guys,
presentation was great.

00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:11,055
You made it clear
that the product is good.

00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:12,257
The challenge is,

00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:13,958
I just don't know
the lawn and garden business.

00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,994
I just don't have anything
significant

00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:18,263
where I can say
"Here's the accelerant.

00:38:18,263 --> 00:38:19,697
Let's just go."

00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:22,033
So, I think
it's a phenomenal business,

The fantastic thing
about this product

is that it is safe.

00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:35,914
So I'm very interested.

00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:37,715

to apply.

I know the hardware space
very well.

00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:42,320
I think
this could be a hit,

00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,722
but I think you need
to change the packaging.

00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:47,358
And I need the message
to be more clear.

we came in asking for 10%,

how much money we could make.
