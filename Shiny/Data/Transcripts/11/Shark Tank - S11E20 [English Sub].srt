00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:04,817

It's nice that
you brought in your daughter,

to really take an investment

00:06:17,964 --> 00:06:19,599
and accelerate
the growth...
Yes.

00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:21,200
...you have to get
that point where,

00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,902
"Okay, how can I get to
five employees?

00:06:22,902 --> 00:06:24,837
How can I get
to 10 employees?"
Right.

has to go through.

came in here,
the two cousins...
Yes.

00:06:37,617 --> 00:06:39,752
...the most important question
they answered was,

00:06:39,752 --> 00:06:41,187
"How much
are you doing a day?"

00:06:41,187 --> 00:06:43,256
And they had only been
in business three months.

00:06:43,256 --> 00:06:45,491
Yes.
And they said,
"$5,000 a day."

00:06:45,491 --> 00:06:48,428
We've done $6,400 a day,
has been our top.

00:06:48,428 --> 00:06:51,431
So that's more than
$3 million a year

six or seven days a week.
Right.

Well, this kind of math,
I can do

inside and out.

00:07:12,318 --> 00:07:15,021

of franchises out of this.

I think it can grow.

to go to your class.

Billy Blanks Jr.

that works best for them.

too early, so I'm out.

and your business
would speed forward.

The truth of the matter is,
it would slow you down

00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,310
because the only person that
could hit the bumps in the road

00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,477

"Let's try this.

Oh, that doesn't work.

who's heading the business.

so much more runway

There's only one way
to get to the right place
at the right time ‐‐

on your own as an entrepreneur.

in yourself.

When I was 16, my parents,
who are freakin' awesome,

00:32:48,653 --> 00:32:51,189
they let me paint all over
the kitchen cabinets, right?

So, my mom,
she worked from home,

00:32:53,224 --> 00:32:55,260

walk through the kitchen,

How much do you charge me
for that?

00:34:47,071 --> 00:34:51,843

About three days.

00:40:43,294 --> 00:40:44,962
for 15%.

00:40:44,962 --> 00:40:47,665
I was gonna ask 20%,
but I really want to save you
from this character, okay?

00:40:47,665 --> 00:40:49,300
Really, I mean it.

00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,102
You wouldn't like him
to do business with ‐‐ truly.

00:40:51,102 --> 00:40:52,970
There's only one
Mr. Wonderful, Emily.
I'm sure.

00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:56,841
I'm gonna stick with my offer.
I'm comfortable with it.

00:40:56,841 --> 00:40:59,610
If I take your offer,
you're a partner of mine,

00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:01,612
so I value everything
that you ‐‐

00:41:01,612 --> 00:41:03,681
What do you see
for what happens next?

00:41:03,681 --> 00:41:06,050
I think
what you have to do

00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:08,953
is give more depth to
your sales line, which is <i>you.</i>

00:41:08,953 --> 00:41:10,021
You're all over the place.

00:41:10,021 --> 00:41:11,222
From what you said,

00:41:11,222 --> 00:41:13,224
I think you're mostly
an administrator at this point.

00:41:13,224 --> 00:41:14,425
What a waste
of your talent.

00:41:14,425 --> 00:41:16,427
I completely agree.

00:41:16,427 --> 00:41:18,362
So I can teach you
how to structure your business

00:41:18,362 --> 00:41:21,365
where it makes optimal sense
of your talent, alright?

00:41:21,365 --> 00:41:22,666
Would you suggest
a sales team?

00:41:22,666 --> 00:41:24,001
I wouldn't say
a sales team, no.

00:41:24,001 --> 00:41:26,070
I bet you most of your business
is coming to you,

00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,405
versus you going out
for it.

00:41:27,405 --> 00:41:28,506
Correct.

00:41:28,506 --> 00:41:30,708
That means there's a lot
of business to be had.

00:41:30,708 --> 00:41:33,110
Anybody who listens to you
is gonna fall in love with you.

00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:35,413
I would've never guessed
you would've got two offers,

00:41:35,413 --> 00:41:37,681
I got to tell you,
the beginning of the pitch...
