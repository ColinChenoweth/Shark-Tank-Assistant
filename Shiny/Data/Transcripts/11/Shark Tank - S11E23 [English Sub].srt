to a window manufacturer

to house it.

below the window

which is to have it in its place
when it's needed,

partner with a window company,

for the window company ‐‐

of the window itself,

00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:02,555
Nice body.
...who cares?

00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:04,190
And, Sharks...
Nice socks, Kev.

00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,526
...that's why
we <i>can</i> chocolate milk.

00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:11,130
[ Tab pops ]
Literally.

00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,232
We are Slate,

00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:16,735
the first lower‐sugar,
higher‐protein line

00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:19,705
of lactose‐free chocolate milks
for adults.

00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:21,707
We use a process
called ultra‐filtration,

00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:22,875
which allows us
to filter out

00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:25,010
the natural lactose sugars
from milk,

00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,414
leaving us with a creamy,
better‐for‐you chocolate milk.

00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:31,417
We pair that with a popular
latte canning process,

00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:34,119
which makes these puppies
shelf‐stable,

00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,088
able to be shipped
to your doorstep.

00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:38,724
Sharks,
you <i>can</i> be a part

00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:41,794
of our chocolate milk
revolution.

00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:44,930
So, who wants to join
us modern milkmen

00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,131
and give chocolate milk

00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:47,766
a clean slate?
A clean slate?

00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:48,868
[ Laughter ]

00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:51,003
‐Let us try it.
‐Yeah, we got some.

00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:53,172
‐Mark and I can drink this?
‐Yes. Lactose‐free.

00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:55,407
'Cause this will be
a very short pitch if we can't.

00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:56,876
And just so you know,
before we hand these out ‐‐

00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:57,877
we have one can.

00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,078
It's just a prototype,
though.

00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:00,679
The can is just
a prototype.

00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:03,415
‐That means presales, right?
‐It does.

00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:06,785
$4 million valuation, huh?
On no revenue.

00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,520
Kevin's gonna love ‐‐
Please. Allow me
to get the numbers.

00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,423
‐And he's still smiling.
‐[ Laughs ]

00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:13,092
So, what do you
want to start with? Dark?

00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:15,060
‐We go dark first?
‐So, dark first.

00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,196
‐Okay, dark first.
‐Dark first.

00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:18,797
Lubin:
So, this dark chocolate ‐‐

00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:20,900
we are targeting
the dairy‐alternative drink ‐‐

00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,301
Ohh!

00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,004
I do not like that at all.

00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:26,538
Mark, do you drink
dark chocolate?

00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,574
Do you eat
dark chocolate?
I <i>eat</i> dark chocolate.

00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,609
You do?
Yeah. It's just...

00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:32,378
‐I mean, I didn't love it.
‐Okay.

00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:35,347
But when Mark threw up on it,
I liked it more,

00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:36,682
so, like,
it's come the other way.

00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:39,285
I like the classic
better than the dark, actually.

00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:41,086
That's fair. So, the classic
should remind you

00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,923
of that chocolate milk
that you drank growing up.

00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:47,626
There's a distinct dryness after
you swallow it, on my tongue.

00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:50,729
There's a little funky‐chicken
thing going on there.

00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:52,932
'Cause I know what
chocolate milk tastes like.

00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,733
It's one
of my greatest weaknesses,

00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:56,869
and I would love to get away
from the calories.

00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:58,570
Exactly.
I'm hoping
you're telling me

00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,006
this is a big
alternative‐calorie option.

00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:02,141
Absolutely.
Yes.

00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:04,576
So,
we have 75% less sugar

00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:06,712
than chocolate milks
currently on the market.

00:24:06,712 --> 00:24:08,714
You could have three of
our cans, and that would equate

00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:11,250
to the amount of sugar
and more or less calories.

00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,153
So, we have 130 calories
in each one of our cans.

00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:15,454
We have nine grams
of sugar.

00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,855
Why is it so big?

00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:18,657
So, the protein, baby.

00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,025
Half of consumers
right now

00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:21,460
are decreasing
the amount of sugar,

00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,095
which is why we're playing
on that trend,

00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:24,663
and increasing
the amount of protein.

00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:25,931
What do you make it for now?

00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:27,566
So, right now,
we make it for 85 cents.

00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:29,234
Selling it to a distributor
at what price?

00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:30,769
$1.77. 52%.

00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:32,404
But they haven't
sold yet.

00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:34,306
So, you'll be out at $3.99
at retail?

00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,407
$2.99.
$2.99.

00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:36,875
Corcoran:
You said it's a prototype,

00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,144
so I would assume you haven't
produced the product yet.

00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,512
Yes, so, we've done
a pilot run.

00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,748
But yet,
you have a big price on it.

00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:44,450
So, the valuation.

00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:46,085
‐Yeah, let's get to that.
‐Let's talk about it.

00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:48,120
We're going straight
to valuation.
O'Leary:
No, no, but I like it.

00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,657
Either I eviscerate you now
or you defend it now.

00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:52,825
We're gonna own it.

00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,127
‐It is absurd!
‐So, what were you thinking?

00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:57,162
So, you have two ridiculously
good‐looking founders,

00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,697
which is a huge part
of the valuation.

00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,366
Modest, too.

00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:01,967
Only to Barbara.

00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:05,404
So, our third partner was
a food broker for 40 years,

00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:08,140
and he grew the largest
Greek yogurt company

00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,942
from $140,000 in sales

00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:12,511
to over $150 million
in the Northeast alone.

00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,713
That is one of the reasons
it's worth $4 million?

00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:16,081
He's invested in
three other businesses

00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:17,616
that are all doing
over $20 million in sales...

00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:18,951
‐So?
‐Wait.

00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:21,620
...and he is a partner, and he
is basically our VP of sales.

00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,988
So you don't need a Shark.
Greiner:
Wait, but you're saying,

00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:25,224
"'Cause this guy was successful
with other businesses,

00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:26,558
we're worth
this valuation"?

00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:29,161
Yeah, it's a non‐sequitur.
Doesn't make sense.

00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:30,696
So, the reason why
we talk that way

00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:31,864
is because
of the relationships.

00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,632
You know as good as anybody
in the food world,

00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:34,767
it's all about
your relationships.

00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:36,335
The way
that we're getting it ‐‐

00:25:36,335 --> 00:25:38,270
we've gotten in front
of already four major retailers,

00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,105
and we've been able to do that
because of him.

00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:42,875
But it's all about the product
at the end of the day, right?
Absolutely.

00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,143
You can have
a million connections,

00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:45,944
but if people don't like
the product or the taste...

00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:47,279
O'Leary: Wait a second.

00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,849
The planet I come from,
it's all about the profits.

00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:52,451
You don't have any.

00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:55,320
You're asking us to pay
an enormous price...

00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,923
Yep.
...valuated at $4 million
based on the fact

00:25:57,923 --> 00:26:00,559
that you got a cool guy
that built another business

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,727
who's working with you.

00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:03,128
That we don't know about.

00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:07,099
If you're worth $4 million,
I wonder what <i>I'm</i> worth.

00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:09,201
I've got
a lot of relationships.

00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:10,569
Greiner: Yeah.
I'm Mr. Wonderful.

00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,604
I got to be worth
like $4 billion.

00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,606

No, that's <i>me,</i> Kevin.

00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:16,008

Ha‐pah!

00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,911
We know we're at
the starting line.

00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:22,214
I just don't want
that big foot to crush you.

00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:24,817
I know it's coming,
and I know it's gonna happen.

00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:25,851
It's gonna be ugly.

00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:27,252
I'm doing everything
in my power

00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,088
to help you
get us to that $4 million.

00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,489
Yeah.
Yep.

00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:33,792
In fact, you are now farther
away than when you came in here.

00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:38,597
I think there's something here
that's, like, really wrong.

00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,099
You haven't sold a thing,

00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:44,536
but you're saying
that I should give you $400,000

00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,872
on kind of
a wish and a prayer.

00:26:46,872 --> 00:26:48,807
Do you realize
how that sounds weird?
Yeah.

00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:50,642
I think that we probably
didn't frame the entire ‐‐

00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:52,010
like, where we are
correctly.

00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,579
I think that's probably
something we did incorrectly.

00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:56,715
If you'd come in with sales and
other things and all of that ‐‐

00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:57,783
You're just too early.

00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:59,585
No, absolutely.
You're just too early.

00:26:59,585 --> 00:27:00,819
I'm sorry. I'm out.

00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:04,323
Have you guys raised money
already?

00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:05,824
We have.
We raised about $200,000.

00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:07,359
‐At what valuation?
‐At what valuation?

00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,895
Around a $400,000
valuation way back.
About a year ago.

00:27:09,895 --> 00:27:11,797
So you sold half the company
for $200,000?

00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:15,467
15%, and he bought in,
and he gives us 10 hours a week.

00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,636
We're gonna pay
10 times more

00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,438
than the "super sales dude,"
right?

00:27:19,438 --> 00:27:21,306
I mean...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Absolutely.

00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,109
...you're not even
chocolate milk cockroaches.

00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:26,178
You are single‐cell amoeba.

00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:28,514
You are <i>nothing</i> yet.

00:27:28,514 --> 00:27:30,415
It doesn't taste good enough yet
to go to market.

00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:31,817
You know
you got to work on it, okay?

00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,285
I think that's fair.
I'm just telling you.

00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:34,953
I appreciate it.
And I think
everybody agrees here.

00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:36,889
So, I want
to be kind to you.
Definitely.

00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:39,725
I'm working on a new,
nicer Mr. Wonderful.
Oh, good Lord!

00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:41,960
And I'm having
a really hard time with you,

00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,029
containing myself,
but I'm smiling.

00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:45,063
I'm out.

00:27:47,566 --> 00:27:49,201
Lubin:
Thanks for your time.
And that's fair.
Thank you, Kevin.

00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:51,670
And just so you guys know,
we've done over 100 iterations.

00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,205
But what you didn't provide
for us

00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:56,808
is any proof that you surveyed
10,000 people.

00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:59,878
But if you had said, "We've done
this many taste tests.

00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:01,847
We've analyzed it.
We've perfected it.

00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,815
We find that people
will pay the price"...
Right.

00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:06,852
You basically went from
a business‐planning concept

00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,620
to "Give us your money,"

00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,256
and that's really rough
to ask any investor to do.

00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:12,658
I think that's fair.
Yeah. We appreciate that.

00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:14,960
So, because of those reasons,
I'm out.

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,028
Alright. Thank you.

00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,930
Guys,
you saw my reaction.

00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,698
For a protein shake,
okay,

00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,700
you're willing to accept
that it's not the same.

00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,068
Mm‐hmm.

00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,437
I just don't think it's, like,
"Oh, wow, this is amazing,

00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:27,206
and I just
have to have it."

00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:28,707

00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,502
Hello.
If you're selling
Asian‐inspired bowls,

00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:38,937
you might be a competitor.

00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:41,473
But we are literally better
positioned than anyone else

00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:43,608
to take advantage
of this giant sea change

00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:46,745
that's happening right now
in food delivery.

00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:48,446
I'm here because
we're looking to build

00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:50,015
a virtual restaurant empire

00:35:50,015 --> 00:35:52,784
that makes a massive impact
on people's lives.

00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:55,420
So, Jeff, I'm kind of
conflicted here,

00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,522
because I don't know
if you have a unique idea

00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:59,624
from the CloudKitchen, 'cause
everyone's gonna be doing that.

00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:02,894
So it boils down to,
as Kevin said, creating a brand.

00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:04,863
But that's not the part
that throws me.

00:36:04,863 --> 00:36:06,064
I really like you.

00:36:06,064 --> 00:36:07,232
Thank you, Rohan.

00:36:07,232 --> 00:36:09,167
And you also
make me nervous.

00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,435
I'll be honest.

00:36:10,435 --> 00:36:13,738
Like, there's something
energetic about you,

00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,907
and then there's something
scary about you.

00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:18,209
And I don't know which side
of the coin I want to go on.

00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:24,015
♪♪

00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,855
Narrator: One Shark is out.

00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,490
Rohan is interested in Jeff's

00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:35,060
modern food‐delivery concept,
Salted,

00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:38,063
but he is conflicted
about the entrepreneur.

00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:40,165
Oza:
I really like you.
Thank you, Rohan.

00:36:40,165 --> 00:36:41,933
And you also
make me nervous.

00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:43,034
I'll be honest.

00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:46,204
Like, there's something
energetic about you,

00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,306
and then there's something
scary about you.

00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:50,809
And I don't know which side
of the coin I want to go on.

00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:54,679
I speak fast,
so I get that, but...
Yeah.

00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,915
...you speak
a little <i>too</i> fast, bud.
Okay.

00:36:56,915 --> 00:37:01,086
So I don't know if I fully got
the answers to the questions,

00:37:01,086 --> 00:37:03,888
and given that
I have concerns potentially,

00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,190
if we worked together,

00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,592
whether you would be listening
to feedback or not,

00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:10,095
I'm gonna flip to the scary side
and say I'm out.

00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:15,967
Jeff, customer acquisition
is the whole business,
at the end of the day,

00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:17,936
and I love your claim
that you don't pay for it,

00:37:17,936 --> 00:37:19,838
but all your competitors do.

00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:21,773
You tell me
you're gonna take seven brands

00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:25,376
and think that you can
support them individually.
Yeah.

00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,878
It's seven times
the headache.

00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:28,379
If I may ‐‐
Wait, wait, wait.

00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:30,715
In the end,
it's the sharp marketer

00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:32,951
that can acquire customers
at the lowest price.

00:37:32,951 --> 00:37:34,586
Maybe it'll be you,

00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:38,423
but your business is not worth
10 million bucks right now.

00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:40,091
So, to talk through
the valuation a little bit ‐‐

00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,259
Look,
you're an intriguing guy.

00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,661
You are in
a very competitive market.

00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:45,964
So, listen, Jeff,
I'm out.

00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:53,471
But you still have
Daddy Warbucks over here.

00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:55,273
So, Jeff,
the challenge is ‐‐
And Lori, no?

00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,608
O'Leary:
You're not out, are you?

00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,343
This isn't really
a food business.

00:37:58,343 --> 00:38:01,045
I wasn't out.
I mean, it <i>is</i> on its surface,
but fundamentally,

00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:04,349
it's an SEO‐on‐delivery‐apps
business.

00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:06,384
So when CloudKitchen opens up
in every city,

00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:08,052
how are you gonna
set yourself apart

00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:10,588
when there's
a thousand delivery options?

00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:13,191
We are building
great brands.

00:38:13,191 --> 00:38:15,527
That's not the answer
I'm looking for.

00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:18,797
I still think it's gonna take
unique SEO skill sets.

00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:19,998
Absolutely ‐‐
so, once we get

00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:21,666
this initial exposure
on these different apps,

00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,902
we're able to put fuel
on the fire, right?

00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:25,436
And how do you put fuel
on the fire?

00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:26,704
It's intelligent marketing.

00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:28,573
It's SEO, it's SEM.

00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:30,842
Okay, so when you talk
about SEO, SEM...
Yeah. Yeah.

00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:32,076
...where?

00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:33,812
Well, we're targeting
specific customers

00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:35,246
in the cities
where we're live, right?

00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:37,081
People who are ‐‐
Within the apps?

00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:39,617
When we do start
spending cash ‐‐

00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:40,685
When you do? Okay.
Yeah.

00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:41,920
We're not on the same page,
Jeff.

00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,688
For those reasons,
I'm out.

00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:45,023
Okay.

00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:46,558
And then there was Lori.

00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:50,061
You know,
I have to say,

00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:53,331
I'm the consumer
of this kind of food.

00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,999
You finished it all,
Lori.
Because I eat ‐‐ Yeah.

00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,068
I've been sitting here,
and I was the last one in,

00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:58,703
but as you were speaking,

00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:03,174
your eyes kept going to Rohan
or to anyone else.

00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,742
I was the last one in
for you.

00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:06,110
I don't know
if that made you nervous.

00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,579
It's the dress
you're wearing, Lori.

00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:09,647
But I think
it's really important

00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:11,249
when I partner
with someone

00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:13,818
that I feel that that partner
really wants me,

00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:15,887
so I would have been in,

00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:18,990
but in this situation,
I was not feeling that from you.

00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:21,092
So I'm sorry.
I'm out.

00:39:24,896 --> 00:39:26,197
Ouch.

00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,299
Cuban: Good luck, Jeff.
I appreciate your time, guys.

00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:30,702
And, uh...
have a great day.

00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:32,737
Good luck.
Corcoran: Yeah, good luck.

00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,444
It went from high energy
to sadness.
I just want to say
something.

00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:40,545
Don't you feel sad?

00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:42,046
That guy
didn't get a deal

00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,781
'cause nobody wanted to
partner with him.

00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:46,017
Absolutely.
He avoided my eyes.

00:39:46,017 --> 00:39:48,653
Appelbaum:
Wasn't super over‐the‐moon
with Lori's comments,

00:39:48,653 --> 00:39:50,788
but I'm gonna be talking
to my mom about it later,

00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:52,790
and we're gonna do
some deep therapy sessions,

00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,058
so we'll see what comes of it.
