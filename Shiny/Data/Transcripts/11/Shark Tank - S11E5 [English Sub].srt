What did you do
last year?
Last year was $157,000.

00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,372
I just want
to try to help you out

00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,374
'cause I don't feel like
you've done a good enough job

00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:12,211
explaining the potential
of a Motherboard.

00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,446
How much revenue
can one do?

00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:15,614
Generally,
for the ambulance right now,

00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:19,218
when we do a 5‐day period,
it's about $30,000 a month.

00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,286
That's good
if you can do it.

00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:21,587
Hey, guys, look,
this is a great business

00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,422
for you guys, right?
I've been there.

00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,424
But it's still driven
by proximity.

00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,293
You got to go
where the people are at,

00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:28,494
and it's driven
by your time.

00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:31,163
You have to have somebody
physically doing that work,

00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,565
so it's hard to scale.
I've been there.

00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:35,167
And so, while it's
a great business for you guys

00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,403
'cause you can just grind it
and go and grow it

00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,405
and make more and more money
that goes into your pocket,

00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,107
it's not
really investable.

00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:42,875
So, for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:43,442
Thank you.

00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,478
You know, I think
that if you were, like,

00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:47,279
in a Kinko's,
in a FedEx,

00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,282
in locations where you just
need to be in people's faces,

00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:52,418
and then to me,
the marketing angle is,

00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:56,188
"We will fix your phone screen
in 20 minutes."

00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:57,523
It's like
pull up and go, right?

00:20:57,523 --> 00:21:00,392
If you can be in enough places
where people can see that,

00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,094
of course
I'd go to you.

00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,462

with the business for you guys.

I wanted to see a big
roll‐out strategy on trucks

00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:24,416
that had a really high return,
and I didn't get that.

that you should take
an investment in it,
to be very honest.

FUBU is still selling
at any minute of the day.

00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:04,223
I don't have to
physically hire other people

00:22:04,223 --> 00:22:05,324
and do things like that,

00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,459

it's investable.

this very clever,

with no occupancy cost,

00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:21,373
and you're able
to generate enough volume

00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:23,475
that you can charge and undercut
your competition.

00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:24,577
That's a brilliant idea.

My advice to you ‐‐
continue to scale that.

00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,348

Here's my general thought
about it.

about that stuff.

at all.

Higgins:
I agree with Daymond.

00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:46,031
I think if you're gonna invest
in something,

00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:48,133
you should at least
have some interest at all.

00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:51,136
I have zero interest in golf.
I've played twice in my life.

00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:53,839
I wouldn't be a good
partner for you, so for
that reason, I'm out.

00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,741
Thanks, Matt.
Thanks.

00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:58,911

There is crossover
into other sports, too.

is there crossover into?

00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:02,814
Well, the future version
that we've been working on ‐‐

it can take a pivot.

00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,951
It can take a high‐speed
starting and stopping.

00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:07,920

soccer, et cetera.

affects the human body.

really specific frequencies

Here's why it works
at a higher price.

And $169's relatively high,
higher than I expected,

00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:35,487

They're already educated and
they see the perceived value.

But because
it's an electronics good

you're an engineer,

00:37:44,229 --> 00:37:45,730
you're gonna continue
to optimize it.

00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:48,366
You might make it a little
bit smaller because it
fits in little places,

00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:50,168
you'll push the cost down,
right?

00:37:50,168 --> 00:37:51,569
And once you get the cost
down to $20,

00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:53,471
then you can come out
with a $99 version.

00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:55,507
With scaling, we already expect
it to come down dramatically.

can you get the price?

with our current manufacturers,

00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,211

to $27.

At what volumes?
10,000.

00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:03,414

Which would then
allow you, then,
