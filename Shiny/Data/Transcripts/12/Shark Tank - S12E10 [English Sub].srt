00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:02,141
to focus on spreading
more positivity,

00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,444
empathy, and connection.

00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:06,713
Our flagship
Love Is Project product

00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:08,715
is our artisan‐made
love bracelets,

00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:11,384
which remind you to love
and be loved.

00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:14,053
Every handmade bracelet
is inspired by the culture

00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,789
and craftsmanship
of each place of origin.

00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:20,026
We've been able to create
over 2,000 jobs

00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,795
for female artisans
in 10 countries.

00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:26,499
Our supporters resonate with our
strong brand message of love.

00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,201
They appreciate
our authenticity,

00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:31,604
our accessibility,
and social impact.

00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:42,048
Love is the common thread
that connects us all.

00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:46,052
It's universal, so come
spread the love with us.

00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:50,123
Have everyone wear
their heart on their wrist.

00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:51,991
We've got so much love
to give.

00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,593
The gifts in front of you
are our way

00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:54,794
of sharing
our love with you.

00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:56,329
Corcoran: Yeah.

00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:58,297
Chrissie, how did you
come up with this idea?

00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,967
My background,
I worked in corporate fashion

00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:03,169
doing concept design
and trend forecasting,

00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:04,437
traveling around the world

00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:06,739
for multibillion‐dollar
fashion companies.

00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:07,807
After I left corporate,

00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:09,675
I spent another eight years
on the ground

00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,879
working in developing countries
with artisan groups,

00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,715
leading sourcing trips
and creating products.

00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:16,983
While living in Kenya,

00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:18,451
I created
the first Love Bracelet

00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:19,652
with the Maasai tribe.

00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,087
Rodriguez: When did you
start the business?

00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,323
I started the project
in January 2017.

00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:27,427
By year end, we'll have made
$4 million since launch.

00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,494
‐Wow.
‐Wow.

00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,029
‐Wow.
‐And this year,

00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,831
it will reach
$2 million at the year end.

00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:33,099
Good for you.
Wow.

00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,134
What makes me most happy
is really to see the impact

00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:36,903
that we've had
on the women's lives,

00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:38,704
you know, seeing them able
to improve their homes

00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:41,140
or send their kids to school
or feed their families.

00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,742
We're more
than just a bracelet.

00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:44,377
It's very inspirational,
Chrissie.
Wow.

00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:47,113
But is there ‐‐ is there
a profit motivation in this,

00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:50,883
or are you trying to sustain
these 2,000‐plus jobs?

00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,952
No, the idea is we're
creating jobs for the women

00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,687
so they can support
their families.

00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,723
Our profit margin blended
is 70%.

00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:59,459
Our EBITDA is 30%.

00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,793
What does
one bracelet cost,

00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,094
and what do you
sell it for?

00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:04,297
So, we have
our Hero products.

00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,632
The landed cost
is normally $3 to $5.

00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,967
And that's for one
of the little bracelets?

00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,635
The beaded bracelet.
Yeah, the beaded ones.

00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:13,139
And then we sell those
between $18 and $30.

00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,974
And where are you
selling them at?

00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,210
We sell them online,
on our store.
Just on your website?

00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:21,481
Oh, we're also in over
350 retailers in 44 states

00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,282
in the United States
and 22 countries.

00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:27,019
I like your messaging.
I think it's important.

00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,222
But how do they find out
about your story?

00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:30,389
What's telling them?

00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:31,858
Cuban: Yeah, how are you
driving traffic?

00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:34,227
Right.
We have digital marketing.

00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:35,495
How much are you spending
per month

00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,096
on that
digital advertising?

00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,799
Gladys, I love your fingers.
What are you doing there?

00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:42,301
I'd love to answer
Mark's questions.

00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:43,469
Fire away, Gladys.

00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,071
When we started,
both Chrissie and I,

00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:47,573
we both don't have
any digital marketing skill.

00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,342
I'm a bean counter, okay?

00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,510
[ Laughter ]

00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,779
So first year,
the Facebook ad kills us,

00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,915
but we went to classes.

00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:59,719
I am a dinosaur in the class,
the oldest lady there,

00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,287
but we just
keep on cranking.

00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:03,489
So the first year,
we might have spent

00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:06,225
about 80% of our revenue
to Facebook.

00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:07,360
Wow.
Rodriguez: Wow.

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,629
That's okay.
I'll take it.

00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:12,532
I'm paying my tuition.
I'm going to learn it.

00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,333
Amen.
Then 2019,

00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,870
it's about 50%,
and now I'm down to 30%.

00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,238
Including agency fees.

00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,674
And it has every reason
to go further down

00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:24,610
because she has
50,000 followers.

00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,779
What's your cost
per individual sale?

00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,248
My cost per acquisition.
Right.

00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:31,817
CPA,
cost per acquisition.

00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,819
Or POAS, right?

00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:37,056
We're keeping it down
to around $25.

00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,792
But our average order
is $75

00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,827
because people are buying
for a gift.

00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:44,263
And our long‐term value
of for customers ‐‐

00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,632
Can you believe it?
You want to give a guess?

00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:49,068
What is my top customers?
They spend...?

00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,136
$300?

00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:51,337
$1,200.

00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:52,672
$4 million.

00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:54,307
[ Laughter ]
Oh!

00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:56,709
I love Barbara.
She has an angle.

00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:59,478
Kevin, this is your
dream company.

00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:02,915
For wedding gifts,
they buy to give to the guests

00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:03,983
to share
the love messages.

00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:04,884
Ah, yes.

00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:06,786
Each one has
a different message.

00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:10,222
Our top wedding party
is $5,000.

00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:11,524
‐Wow.
‐Wow.

00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:13,426
But I want to know a little bit.
You said bean counter.

00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,661
I want to know a little bit more
about your background.

00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:18,664
I came from a strong
lineage of women.

00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:22,735
My mom escaped
the communist China

00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:26,706
and went to Hong Kong
to look for a better future.

00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:32,178
I too immigrated to America
as a student

00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:33,980
looking for
my American dream.

00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,315
Then I quickly got
my CPA.

00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:40,119
I rose up through the ranks
to be a VP finance.

00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,854
Wow.
Which company?

00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,522
Bank of America.
Bank of America?

00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:44,890
Yes.
Good for you.

00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,226
I want to be a little more
focused here for a second, okay?

00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,161
I'm the numbers guy here.
You're the bean counter.

00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,563
Yes.
You said that yourself.

00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:54,166
What did you sell last year,
and what did you make on it?

00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,836
Last year, we sell
a million and one.

00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:58,604
And what did you net
on that?

00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:01,207
That year, we still ‐‐
our Facebook ads

00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:02,808
are still
very expensive.

00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,777
Is that another way of saying
you made no money?

00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:05,945
Yes.

00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:07,613
Could you just tell me
what you lost last year,

00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,315
what the number was?

00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,384
Close to $80,000
in loss.

00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:13,352
Okay, so we have
established

00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,621
that the business
lost $80,000 last year.

00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:18,090
That's not good.
And you have no debt.

00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,026
We have ‐‐
I have
a small business loan.

00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:21,927
How much?
$200,000.

00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,362
Oh.
Cuban: Is that an EIDL?

00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:24,864
Wow.

00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:26,365
So that's where
the $200,000 ‐‐

00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:27,533
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,503
Okay, so $200,000.
Just a standard SBA loan.

00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:31,837
Yes.
Okay, plus you have

00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,673
an EIDL for of how much?
Yes.

00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,808
$382,000.

00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:38,778
$382,000. Wait, wait, wait.
$382,000?

00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:42,515
So that means you have
$582,000 in debt

00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:43,983
on the company right now.

00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:47,219
Chrissie and Gladys, I think
you're both full of yourselves.

00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:49,955
You came in here saying

00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:52,158
that you had a company
with a mission.

00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:55,795
I don't see it that way at all.
I see it as a mission, period.

00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:57,596
But you don't take care
of the business end.

00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,065
See, I don't agree
with that, Barb.

00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:00,332
Really?
I don't agree
with that at all.

00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:02,068
Yeah.
Well, then maybe
Mark will invest.

00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:05,471
I totally mistrust your capacity
to make a profit.

00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,139
And now you ‐‐
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,175
And now you come in here,
and you're asking

00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:11,977
for an investment in a business
that had a loss last year.

00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:14,213
It's the equivalent of you
coming in and asking us

00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,048
for a charity donation.

00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,850
Maybe you have something
to convince me otherwise.

00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,118
I'd like to hear it.
Yes, we've been able

00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:22,154
to get unsolicited
celebrity endorsements,

00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:23,222
international press,

00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,557
and secure
big brand partnerships.

00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,859
Yeah, but it's got to
at some point translate

00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:28,027
to the bottom line,
and it hasn't.

00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:29,628
It is happening.

00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:30,696
It will this year.

00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,164
But most entrepreneurs
always believe

00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,599
it might happen
the next year.

00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,434
I'm afraid I could never
think of investing in it.

00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:37,503
We can show that.
So for that reason, I'm out.

00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:42,274
You've done a great job
in articulating the mission.

00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:44,143
I get that.

00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:46,946
My mother taught me that
if you're successful in life,

00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:48,347
you have to give back.

00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:49,515
So far this year,

00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:51,617
I'm at 35 charities
that I've supported,

00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,385
and the only reason I can

00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:56,255
is that the majority
of my investments make money.

00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,758
And I take that,
and I give back.

00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,527
I'm confused
with this presentation.

00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:05,564
Am I investing in a business,
or am I investing in a mission?

00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:08,234
This is not the Charity Tank.
This is the Shark Tank.

00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:11,570
I'm a Shark. I want to invest,
and I want to make money.

00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,706
