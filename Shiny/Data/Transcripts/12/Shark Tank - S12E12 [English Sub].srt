to make their day better.

00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:44,590
It was important for us

00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,026

I'm 17 years old,
and this is my brother Michael.

We're from beautiful
West Palm Beach, Florida.

As a recent

so frequently talked about,

00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:16,249
it happens more often
than you would think.

It can even happen
while you're holding your drink.

So I do it in my hair like this?

‐Yes.
‐Exactly like that, yes.

00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:12,872
This is a widespread problem
on college campuses.

And who is your
typical customer?

00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:18,911
So, 70% of our customers
are 18 to 24,

and 98% of them are women.

00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:24,884
As for the problem,
when we started this business,

00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:28,321
we surveyed 100 women
18 to 25.

00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,023

they had their drink spiked.

at scale to $1.60.

come up with this?
Corcoran: What gave you
this great big idea?

Shirah: So, I came up
with this idea

00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:48,007
because this happened
to a college friend of mine.

00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,842
She was at a bar,
put her drink down,

00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,644
a guy came
and spiked it.

I wanted to come up
with something

00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,381
so that this wouldn't happen
to anybody else.

00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,650
So I slept on it ‐‐
literally,

00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,986
because I came up with it
in a dream.

00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:02,555
And when I woke up,
I went to my mom's closet,

00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,724
grabbed her pantyhose
and a scrunchie,

00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:07,260
cut them up, and created
the first prototype.

and being in college
for the last four years,

00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:29,482
I understood the need
for a solution like this.

00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,384
So I decided
to drop everything

00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,419
and help make her dream
a reality.

00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,420

We have no business
or marketing experience,

00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,107
and it took us a long time

00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:56,809
to really figure out
what worked, what doesn't.

00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:59,211
Originally, I was like, "Oh,
we'll just run Facebook ads.

00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:00,313

was website optimization
and social media marketing,

00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:11,991
and we really figured out

00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:15,227
how to do the social media
marketing in March,

00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:17,763
and then in April,
we redid our website.

to start the business.

So, the other two ways,

00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:47,232
I do.
I have an SBA loan for 123,000.

00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:50,102
I also have a home equity
line of credit,

00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:51,136
which I draw on,
and then pay back.

00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:52,905
Corcoran: My God.
Oh, my goodness.

00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:56,141
So, all in, how much ‐‐
How much home equity credit
have you used up for this?

00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:57,509
Uh...right now,

00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,111
it's about $600,000, I guess.

00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:00,012
‐Ohh!
‐Ooh!

00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,947
So you're in for 2.35?
Na‐a‐a‐ncy!

00:28:01,947 --> 00:28:03,715
What is your
biggest expense?

00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:05,717
Are there any large
singular expenses?

00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:07,219
Yeah.
Trade spend, basically.

00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:10,489
Promotions, couponing,
slotting fees...

00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:12,157
Oh, you fell sucker for that.
Okay. I'm sorry. Ohh.

00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:14,826
...refills, co‐packer issues.
They were making you put ‐‐

00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,628
Ohh, I'm so sorry
you went through that.

00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:18,397
Which I've solved, by the way,
but yeah.

00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:19,798
Okay.
Let's talk about your margins.
Greiner: That's great.

00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:21,567
Because there's a ‐‐
53%.

00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:23,035
Okay, wait.
One of these ‐‐

00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,970
The retail price
to a consumer is...?

00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:28,674
Is $1.99 to $2.99.

00:28:28,674 --> 00:28:30,776
What do you sell it
to the grocery store for?

00:28:30,776 --> 00:28:32,010
$1.05.
$1.05.

00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,111
And it costs you...?

00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:34,813
50 cents.

00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:37,649
So you got to sell
a boatload of cookies

00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,017
in order to do this.
Yes.

00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:40,252
Oy.
You're right.

00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:41,820
Your margin is more like ‐‐
Oy, oy, and double‐oy.

00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,289
Your actual margin
is probably about 15%.

00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:46,758
You can ship this
directly to the customer

00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:48,460
and forget about grocery
completely.

00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,128
That model can actually exist.
Yeah, what are
you doing online?

00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:52,297
We had already been
selling on Amazon

00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:54,800
and doing pretty well
every month.

00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,936
It was 35% of our business
in January.

00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:00,439
Now it's 55% of business.
Wow.

00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:03,976
You know, I wasn't crazy
about the flavor profile.

00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:05,310
The peanut butter one

00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,279
tastes like a protein shake
a little bit.

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,380
I mean,
I understand you have to

00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,682
sacrifice flavor
for the health,

00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:14,119
but you don't want a partner
who is not really in love

00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,487
and obsessed
with the product.

00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,289
I can ‐‐ Yeah.
This is just not for me,
so I'm out.

00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:19,157
Okay.
Thank you, Daymond.

00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:21,426
Greiner: I think you've done
an amazing job.

00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:24,596
You've created a product
that I happen to really like,

00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,232
but I just think it would be
a really, really long time

00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:28,967
before I would
see my money back.

00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:32,471
I will be a customer,
but unfortunately, I'm out.

00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:36,541
Thank you. Well, I want you to
know I am very open to a loan.

00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,510
Yeah, but ‐‐
but Nancy, look ‐‐ look.

00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,445
You're repeating
your same mistakes.

00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,848
You're gonna have to
go against your home
equity loan some more,

00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:46,084
and that is terrifying,
and it should be terrifying

00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:47,085
'cause effectively,

00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:48,987
you're putting your home
at risk now.

00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:51,123
And so please be careful,
right?

00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,891
But for those reason,
I'm out.

00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:55,227
Okay.
Thank you, anyway, Mark.

00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:57,029
What I love about you,

00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:59,364
and I'm sitting here
dying to give you money,

00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:01,133
is you're so damn happy.

00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,601
I would be miserable.

00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:05,370
Well, I'll tell you,
Barbara, honestly and truly,

00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:09,374
my eyes pop open
every morning at 5:00 a. m.,

00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:12,277
and I cannot wait
to get to my desk.

00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:13,245
Good for you.

00:30:13,245 --> 00:30:14,813
But that same optimism

00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,149
is what got you into the debt
in the first place.

00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,583
You're asking all of us

00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:20,752
to buy into a debt more
than a business...
Well ‐‐

00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:22,954
...and so for that reason,
I'm out, also.

00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:25,223
Okay. Thank you,
anyway, Barbara.

00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:26,425
O'Leary: Your business
is worth between

00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:28,493
$800,000
and $1 million, okay?

00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,630
So, to give you
$400,000,

00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,298
I'd have to get
50% of it.

00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:35,834
This is un‐investable
as it stands right now.

00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,637
If you only want to sell
10% or 20% of the business,

00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:40,005
that's worth 100 grand.

00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:41,673
The rest you have to
take on as debt.

00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,943
I mean, I'm feeling guilty
just thinking about that offer.

00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:46,545
And I'm sorry, Nancy.
I just ‐‐

00:30:46,545 --> 00:30:49,247
I can't go down the journey
with you.

00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:50,582
I'm sorry. I'm out.

00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:52,818
Okay.
Well, thank you, anyway.

00:30:52,818 --> 00:30:54,353
We wish you the best, Nancy.
All the best.

00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:55,620
‐Thank you.
‐Good luck with it, Nancy.

00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,788
‐Alright.
‐Alright.

00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:57,889
Kalish:
Bye, guys. Thank you.

00:30:57,889 --> 00:30:59,391
Good luck.
Congratulations, Nancy.

00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:01,093
So, I didn't get a deal,

00:31:01,093 --> 00:31:04,162
but I got a lot of great advice
from the Sharks,

00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:06,164
and I'm certainly
gonna take it.

00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:08,834
They talked about focusing
my business online,

00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:10,836
which is how I want to go,

00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:13,538
and it's a clear
path forward to success

00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,641
and breaking the rules
far into the future.

00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:19,945

through mountains and snow

00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:54,012
to be here in the Tank

00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:55,647
My name is Peter Arlein.

00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:57,883
I'm from Carbondale, Colorado,

00:31:57,883 --> 00:32:00,619
and I'm here seeking $250,000

00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:04,956
for 10% equity in my company,
mountainFLOW Eco‐Wax.

00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:08,326
As a passionate skier,
I love spending time

00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:11,096
in Colorado's
beautiful Rocky Mountains.

00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:13,598
And like millions
of other skiers,

00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,500
I'm using a lot of ski wax

00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,702
to make sure that my skis
are running smoothly

00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:20,071
in every type of snow condition.

00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:22,774
But, Sharks, did you know...

00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,744
that nearly all
the ski wax in the world

00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:27,579
is derived from petroleum?

00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:28,513
That's right.

00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:29,948
The same fossil fuel that's used

00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,451
to make gasoline and diesel.

00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:33,752
That's gross, right?

00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,889
And whatever
you put on your skis

00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:39,925
goes directly into the snowpack

00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:42,461
and then into
your drinking water.

00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:45,831
Aaah!

00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:46,865
[ Laughs ]

00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:49,468
This is tons
of petroleum‐based wax

00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:52,270
in the environment
every single winter.

00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,773
That's why I created
mountainFLOW,

00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:57,609
the world's best
entirely plant‐based

00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:59,144
ski and snowboard wax.

00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:00,645
It's biodegradable,

00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,113
and it works just as well

00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:04,883
as a conventional
petroleum‐based wax.

00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:06,651
Our patent‐pending formula

00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,753
has been rigorously tested,

00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:11,990
and it's proved to be
just as fast or faster

00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,359
than any comparable wax
on the market.

00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:16,695
In fact, we already have a team

00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:19,130
of world‐champion
skiers and snowboarders

00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,999
who are using our eco‐wax

00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:24,069
and doing their part to keep
the mountains free of petroleum.

00:33:29,908 --> 00:33:31,576
Sharks, in front of you,

00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:33,745
you'll see some samples
of our product,

00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:37,015
and over here, I'll show you
exactly how it works.

00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,751
MountainFLOW
is super easy to use.

00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:41,586
It's the same exact process

00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:44,823
as a regular
petroleum‐based wax.

00:33:44,823 --> 00:33:47,893
You just drip the wax
onto the ski...

00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,996
...and then iron it in.

00:33:50,996 --> 00:33:52,430
Just like that.

00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:56,067
Once this cools,
you're ready to hit the slopes.

00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:57,569
When I'm skiing ‐‐

00:33:57,569 --> 00:33:59,671
and I'm very particular
about my equipment

00:33:59,671 --> 00:34:01,206
because I'm so good at it.

00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:02,541
By the way, as an aside,

00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:05,377
I have never skied
against a man I didn't beat.

00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:06,411
Any age.
Is that a challenge?

00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:07,546
Good for you.

00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:10,515
My experience is everybody
drops it off at a shop

00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:11,883
and gets their skis waxed.

00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,352
It's cheap. I think I pay
50 bucks each time.

00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:16,021
Would that be right?
Yeah.

00:34:16,021 --> 00:34:18,623
And it's perfectly done.
I have no idea how they do it.

00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:21,126
But the next morning,
my skis are perfect.

00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:22,961
Who is your demographic?

00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:24,529
We're targeting
all of the markets.

00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:26,932
So, we're going after
the direct‐to‐consumer market.

00:34:26,932 --> 00:34:29,401
These are people
who are comfortable
doing it themselves.

00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:30,869
Do you sell it
to the ski shops?

00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:32,103
We do.

00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:34,506
So, if you can imagine
a ski town,

00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:36,875
there's 10 ski shops
on the same street.

00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:38,376
What are you
holding there?

00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:40,312
So, this is a quick wax.

00:34:40,312 --> 00:34:42,914
So for people who don't
have the equipment ‐‐

00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,416
the iron, the set up ‐‐

00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:47,319
this, anybody could use.
Oh, that's different.

00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:49,821
And so it goes more to that
direct‐to‐consumer market.

00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:52,457
It's like this.
A pad is in there.

00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:55,060
You just rub it on your skis,
and that's it.

00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,562
Why does a person
need to wax their skis?

00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:59,197
What happens
when you're skiing

00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:00,565
is that the snow crystals

00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:03,368
are actually grinding
against the bottom of your ski.

00:35:03,368 --> 00:35:05,904
So, if you have no wax,
your skis are gonna be slower.

00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:08,907
So, with the wax on there,
what's happening is

00:35:08,907 --> 00:35:12,344
that the snow crystals
are pulling wax out of the ski.

00:35:12,344 --> 00:35:15,580
That's why it's so important
to use an eco‐friendly product,

00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,782
'cause, literally,
the deposition into the snowpack

00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,751
Ah.
...is how the wax works.

00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:21,319
I'm probably
the only snowboarder up here.

00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:22,988
I call myself
Chocolate Powder.

00:35:22,988 --> 00:35:24,222
When I don't have time
to go to Utah,

00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:25,490
I snowboard in New York,

00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,792
and that's like snowboarding
on a Brillo pad, right?

00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,127
Right.

00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,528
The snow can be
sort of horrible.
Or ice.

00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:33,331
So I need to wax
all the time,

00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:35,533
or, I mean,
it has no performance.

00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:37,035
What are you making it for
right now,

00:35:37,035 --> 00:35:38,937
and what are you selling it,
the average price?

00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:42,974
Average price is $16 retail.
We make it for $2.50.

00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,676
That's great,
great margins.

00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:46,344
So then next question,
obviously, is,

00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:47,479
tell us about your sales.

00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:48,680
Yep.

00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,182
Last year,
we did $150,000 in sales.

00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:53,818
This year,
we're projected to do $750,000.

00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:54,819
Oh, good for you.
Wow.

00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,255
$750,000?
Wow. What's the bump?

00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,190
We're moving international,

00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,392
and we're also adding

00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:01,893
a line of race wax
to our product.

00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:03,228
Switzerland, for example,

00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:05,597
has just mandated
no petroleum.

00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:08,066
It's not petroleum,
but it's fluorocarbon.

00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:09,100
That can't hurt you.

00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,568
That's gonna help you
immensely, right?

00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:12,270
Oh, it's huge for us.
Same with France.

00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,205
Same with Germany.
Same with Austria.

00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:15,940
The whole world.
The United States, too.

00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,542
So, Peter, listen.

00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,611
I love innovation,

00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:21,846
especially when it's better
for our environment,

00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:25,116
but I'm just
not a skier,

00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:27,052
and I really didn't
even know much

00:36:27,052 --> 00:36:28,820
about waxing skis at all.

00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,256
So, it's not the right
investment for me.

00:36:31,256 --> 00:36:33,258
Unfortunately, I'm out.

00:36:33,258 --> 00:36:34,526
Well, thank you, Lori.

00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:36,995
My problem is, I've never
skied in my entire life.

00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:38,530
So I'm out.

00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,765
Okay, but we might have to take
you skiing, even if you're out.

00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:42,267
You might have to take me
skiing someday.

00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:44,135
And when I do,
this is what I'm gonna buy.

00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:45,837
The one thing
I wanted to mention,

00:36:45,837 --> 00:36:47,572
and I mentioned it
a little bit in the pitch,

00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:48,873
but we have some of the best

00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,675

We just signed the
number‐one skier in the world.

He won the overall
2020 World Cup last year,

00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,152
and he's signed on
to use our wax

00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:03,555
and promote it this year.

00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:06,391
I'd like to make
an offer to you.

00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:08,093
I'm really surprised
I'm offering

00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:10,929
because usually when someone
walks into the Tank,

00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:13,498
I take one look at their face,
I think, "I'm out."

00:37:13,498 --> 00:37:17,202
And when I looked at your face,
I said, "Goofy guy. I'm out."

00:37:17,202 --> 00:37:20,004
You just have that
big goofy face, you know?

00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:22,240
But I'm falling
in love with it.

00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,443
You're perfect for the part
of selling to ski shops, right?

00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:28,246
I mean, who wouldn't believe
a word of what you said, okay?

00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,683
So, I'd give you the $250,000,
but I must have 20%.

Barbara's head a little bit.

And you know why
he's doing that?

do the deal together...

I left him out.
