Guys, let me help
clear things, as well.

00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:11,631
Look, I did an analysis
at one point in my career

00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:15,135
where I spent about
an hour a week making my bed,

00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:17,037
and then I extrapolated
that out and figured,

00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:19,406
"That's 365 hours a year."

00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:22,108
Across 10 years,
that's <i>months.</i>

00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,011
And so, I vowed that I kept
my sheets and bedding clean,

00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:27,113
but I would
never make my bed.

00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,615
And for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:29,983
Okay.
Okay.

Okay.

00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:35,322
I'm gonna give you
three reasons

00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:37,524
why you should choose me
as a Shark, 'cause I imagine

you're gonna see
other offers here today.

00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:43,363
Number one, I'm going to
bring down your cost to $20

00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:45,999
if you want to keep it
in the United States.

00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:48,969
If you're willing to go out,
I'll bring it down to $11.

00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:52,138
Secondly, I am great
at driving public relations.

making $65 million a year

is making the money
predominantly because

I am great
at creating publicity.

No, one more.

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,421
I always pick
the same kind of people ‐‐

00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,457
great people

people that
love each other.

00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,660

being very happy

in the nucleus family
that I put together.

00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:20,133
I'm going to give you
the $150,000 for 20%.

00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,535
The reason I need 20% is,

00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,437
I don't think
about my investments

00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,940

honest to God ‐‐

00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:03,836
and then the other 15%
now was online,

and everything shifted
to be online.

00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:08,274
You were selling in grocery
in the frozen section?
Yes, we were.

We were selling
16 cases a week.
Greiner: Wow!

00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:12,478
So, 16 cases a week
is how much money?

00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:16,215
So, that accumulated
for $30,000 in our sales.

00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,918
So, what was the price
that you were selling
to them the four‐pack?

00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:21,020
We were selling it
to them for $10,

and they were
selling it for $17.

00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,890

was 10 bucks?
Yes.

making no money.

getting killed.

Jones: Yes.

00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,745
This is child's play ‐‐
literally.

00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:34,746
Ohh, just missed it.

00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:36,414
I'm so ill with mine.

00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:38,016
I actually want to
show you guys a demo

00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,417
of how the coding
in Hopscotch works

00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,119
so you can just
get a sense of it.

00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,054
So, this is
the coding editor,

00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:45,257
and you're coding
with these cool characters.

00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:47,058
I'm just gonna walk you
through making this game

00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:49,427
where the crocodile is
gonna go after the octopus,

00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:51,062
and then
it's gonna eat it.

00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,898
And then, you can do ‐‐

00:33:52,898 --> 00:33:54,099
With just a little bit
more code,

00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:55,700
you can start to see
how this turns into a game.

00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,402
So, now, the crocodile
has all these other people,

00:33:57,402 --> 00:33:59,371
and it's getting bigger
as it eats more.

00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:01,573
That's pretty cute.
Thank you.

00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:03,475
That's awesome, yeah.
Greiner: Samantha,
tell us about you.

00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:05,277
How did you
come up with this?

00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:07,012
You know,
when I was a kid,

00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:09,614
I never thought
that coding was for me.

00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:12,017
I was like, "Computers?
Those are for boys."

00:34:12,017 --> 00:34:14,786
And it wasn't until
my senior year of college

00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:17,222
that I took my first
computer science class,

00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:19,057
and it was so empowering,

00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,725
and it was so creative.

00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,694
And I was like,
"Why didn't I know

00:34:22,694 --> 00:34:25,730
that programing was so fun
and creative and interesting

00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,667
and I could make things that
people actually care about?"

00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:32,270
So, Hopscotch actually
launched in 2012,

00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,039
and at that time,
it was all free.

00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:37,175
And our first week,
we got 20,000 downloads.

00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:39,010
So we got a lot of press.

00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,178
You guys were
on top of the world.

00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:41,313
You were dominating

00:34:41,313 --> 00:34:43,181
for kids' programing
languages at the time.

00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:45,116
Totally.
O'Leary: And there was
no revenue at that time?

00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:47,052
No revenue,
no revenue model.

00:34:47,052 --> 00:34:48,687
Continued to build.
We were first‐time
entrepreneurs.

00:34:48,687 --> 00:34:50,055
We were like,
"Grow, grow, grow!"

00:34:50,055 --> 00:34:52,457
Honestly, guys, like, when it
comes to kids and school,

00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:54,092
there's some other
alternatives...
Yeah.

00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,628
...but Hopscotch is
the go‐to name.

00:34:56,628 --> 00:34:57,829
They crush it, right?

00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,230
And by the way,
when I said I used it

00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,966
and posted an app,
I meant it, right?

00:35:00,966 --> 00:35:02,367
Yeah.
I use Scratch.

00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:04,536
And then, when my kids first
got into it at school,

00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:06,938
we used Hopscotch
and developed games.
That's awesome.

00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,741
It's intriguing.
How do I make money?

00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:12,777
So, we have a currency
that you can buy

00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,512
in Hopscotch
from the App Store.

00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:17,616
And then, you'll be able to
use that currency

00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,351
inside another kid's game.

00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:20,585
So, that'll be
the revenue?

00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:22,354
You'll keep the 2/3
of the revenue

00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:24,189
from the app
you'll sell?
Yes.

00:35:24,189 --> 00:35:25,557
And then, eventually,
we want to

00:35:25,557 --> 00:35:27,359
let kids share
in the revenue, as well.

00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,861
So we would eventually
let kids cash out

00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:30,996
that they earn
in their game.

00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:32,697
What the active
user base?

00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:34,366
Our active
user base now

00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:37,636
is about 200,000
active users a month.

00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:38,637
What was your peak?

00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:42,641
Our peak was in 2015,
I believe,

00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:45,310
and we were at about
400,000.

00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:48,380
♪♪

00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,148
So, what happened is,

00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:53,251
we raised our first round
of venture capital in 2013

00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:54,653
after we launched the app,

00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:57,122
and then we raised
our second round in 2015.

00:35:57,122 --> 00:35:59,257
And then, we saw
the trajectory we were on,

00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:01,326
where it was
all about growth,

00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:03,995
and we were gonna have to
continue raising capital.

00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,297
And we didn't want to
run the risk

00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:08,900
of just going out of business
if we couldn't raise money.

00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,103
So we started switching
to a subscription model.

00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:14,272
So we are
profitable now.

00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:15,840
How many subscribers
do you have?

00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,810
We have about 6,200
subscribers right now.

00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,512
What's their cost
per month?

00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:24,315
Hopscotch costs $8 per month
or $80 per year.

00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:25,517
Corcoran: How profitable
are you now?

00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,052
So, we're basically

00:36:27,052 --> 00:36:29,387
not really burning cash,
not really making cash,

00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:31,623
but that's kind of a decision
to have a team that...

00:36:31,623 --> 00:36:33,558
So you're breaking even.
...matches
with our revenue.

00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:36,628
And that's kind of why
I'm coming to you, Sharks.
Right.

00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:37,762
We have this
subscription business,

00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:39,698
and it keeps us
in business,

00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,633
but it's not really

00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:43,501
the right business model
for Hopscotch.

00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:45,737
We want a little bit
more capital

00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:48,807
so that we can start
getting rid of that paywall,

O'Leary: And you hope
that gets traction

00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,050
because by taking down
the subscription paywall,

00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,553
you give up that
revenue stream in perpetuity.
