snack company KIND
returns to the Tank.

00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:07,875
Your product
has to be your hero,

00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:09,910
and it has to stand
on its own merits.

00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,279
Let's talk about
how the sausage gets made.

00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:15,215
It's time to make shopping with
babies fun, safe, and simple.

the Dolphin Tank.

I so want to
rip you to pieces.

I'm dying to rip you

Narrator: First into the Tank

to eat a little healthier.

00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,958
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Phil Wong.

00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,860
And I'm from Brooklyn, New York.

00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,230
Let's talk about how
the sausage gets made.

00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,933
So many Americans
want to eat less meat,

00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:07,067
whether it's for their health,

00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,903
for our planet,
or for animal welfare.

00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:14,174
But it's no secret that most
aren't ready to go vegetarian.

00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:18,879
So why are we stuck
with an all‐or‐nothing choice

00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,047
when we go
to the grocery store?

00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:22,849
We thought, why can't we
put veggies <i>and</i> meat

00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,818
into a product
that people would love?

00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:26,987
Well, Sharks,
that's where we come in.

00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:29,890
We're meeting in the middle.

00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,793
Introducing Misfit Foods,

00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:35,095
a line of delicious sausages

00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,231
that are half chicken
and half veggies and spices.

00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:41,835
Our three flavors
will knock your socks off.

00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:43,937
And they're made
with sustainability in mind,

00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,305
helping people eat less meat

00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:48,208
by putting more delicious food
on the dinner table,

00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:51,545
because we believe
that change can taste good,

00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:52,913

00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:55,649
So, Sharks, don't miss out
on this one.

00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,752
250K for 5% of our company.

00:01:58,752 --> 00:01:59,720
Wow.

00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,954
Sharks, in front of you,

00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,690
we have our sausages
prepared three different ways.

00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,891
The first is my favorite.

00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:07,094
It's our Sweet Potato Andouille
mac and cheese.

00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:09,096
Next,
our Kale Chimichurri tacos.

00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:11,898
And last is a classic
squash Italian

00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,967
on a bun with the fixings.

00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,970
Greiner: Wow.
The Citrus Kale is delicious.

00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,972
Thank you.
I'm so glad to hear it, Lori.
Really good.

00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,074
One thing that I noticed
that I really like

00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,210
is that your sodium
is lower

00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,546
than the typical
chicken sausages that I buy.

00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:27,114
And the other thing, too,

00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:29,116
is that we have about
40% less cholesterol

00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:31,251
than your typical
chicken sausage, as well.

00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:34,221
And that's something that
our consumers really care about.

00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:36,323
Phil, who's the market
you're going after?

00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:39,760
Like, are you trying to get
people that are meat eaters

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,762
to eat less meat?

00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:42,996
Absolutely,
and, you know,

00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,165
I think the proof
is kind of in the pudding.

00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,200
We're in our first full year
in market right now,

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,903
and we're on track
for $1.2 million in sales.

00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:51,004
‐Wow.
‐Wow.

00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,240
And so, you know,
a good portion of those people

00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,809
are just, you know,
your pure carnivores.

00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:57,744
What's your actual sales
to date?

00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:00,147
So we've done
just under 800K to date.

00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:02,816
How are you selling it,
direct or through retail?

00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:04,785
We're about 20%
brick and mortar,

00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:07,087
and that's Whole Foods,
and 80% online.

00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:09,222
How did you come up with this?
What's your background?

00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:12,859
So, you know, food's always been
a really huge part of my life.

00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,227
I grew up in a family
of immigrants.

00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:18,832
So my mom is from Indonesia.
My dad is from Macao.

00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:20,967
And so my connection
to Indonesia and Macao

00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:23,170
when I was growing up
was through food.

00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,072
And when I got to college
at Georgetown,

00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:27,040
I started learning more
about just, like,

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,578
how huge our environmental
footprint is with our food.

00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:32,279
So I started wondering,

00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:35,982
was there a way to use delicious
food to help the environment?

00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:39,352
And so I started Misfit in
the kitchen that I was sharing

00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:42,456
with the six other guys
I was living with at the time.

00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:43,023
Really?

00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,825
Yeah, they weren't
too happy about it.

00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,860
Did you raise money
to do this?

00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,129
Yeah. So we've raised
$2 million to date.

00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:51,031
‐Hello.
‐Wow.
‐What?

00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:53,667
We're here to not hit
a single or a double, right?

00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:54,935
We're here to hit a home run.

00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:57,170
So what was your last valuation
of the company at?

00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,973
So the last valuation
was $4 million.

00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,742
Well, we haven't
even talked about

00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,110
what it sells for
and what it costs yet.

00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,646
So typically, we're selling
for $4.13 a unit

00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:07,714
to the grocery store.

00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:10,717
Our cost is about
$2.91 a unit.

00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:11,952
Okay, so that's
your biggest challenge.

00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:13,887
‐And what do they sell it for?
‐What do they retail it at?

00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:16,523
And so they're retailing it
for anywhere from $5.99

00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:17,991
to $7.99 a unit.

00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,861
Now, our gross margins work out
to about 29%.

00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,262
What's really important
to know about that

00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,798
is that we hit break even
in May of this year,

00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:25,932
and I think that points
to the fact

00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,301
that we don't have to
market this product a ton

00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:31,805
and, you know, spend a bunch on
slotting fees, promotional fees

00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:33,106
to get people
to buy this product.

00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,308
Are you spending money
on marketing today?

00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:39,146
Very little. It's less
than 5% of our first revenue.
Good for you.

00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:41,815
The refrigerated
and frozen categories

00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:44,785
have eluded me
in making a lot of money.

00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,119
I've made investments
in it.

00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,655
It's burned up
a lot of my hours,

00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:49,923
which is valuable to me,

00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:52,626
and I haven't really had
a huge hit with it yet.

00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,261
I'm out.

00:04:55,262 --> 00:05:00,867
I'm a vegetarian,
and I think it's innovative,

00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,936
but I don't know
if I believe in the trend.

00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:04,638
I think consumers
want to go

00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,107
one way or another.

00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:11,678
You might be right,
but I don't share that vision.

00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:12,913
I'm out.

00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:13,980
Thank you, Robert.

00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,116
So your valuation
seems a little bit rich.

00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:20,253
Mr. Wonderful, could you, like,
soften him up for me?

00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,989
‐Soften him up?
‐Well, I would gladly do that.

00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,125
O'Leary: I mean, you've
obviously done multiple rounds

00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:29,062
at valuations
lower than this.

00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,764
And then you come
in the Shark Tank

00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:32,899
to get a premium investor

00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:36,136
and charge them a premium,
which is not correct,

00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:39,873
because a Shark brings value
that an ordinary investor can't.

00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:41,708
Could you add
"Shame on you"?

00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,809
If you want to get
an investor,

00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,010
you're gonna have to
take a haircut.

00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,681
That's what's gonna happen.
I'm gonna give you...

00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:51,918
$250,000 for 15%.

00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,854
And I'm thinking
that's generous.

00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,255
Well, there's
your first haircut.

00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:57,157
Man, I shaved my head
like two weeks ago.

00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:59,259
I can't afford
to lose any more of this.

Greiner: I think good product
speaks for itself, right?

00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,064
It's gonna sell.

I do wonder if people will start
knocking you off like crazy.

a little bit sharkier.

Yeah.

Mark, you're so right.

It's also because
we want to learn.

And we were at Google and Apple.
We had great jobs.

every night when we come home,

making a difference.

It's about learning.
It's about building.

of competition in

away from that.

This is the problem
we're trying to solve.

to sustainability,

It's about learning something.

00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:15,961
Now, we want to ask Robert
if you'd like to come

00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:17,963
and actually
try catching a wave.

00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:19,798
‐Hi. Sure.
‐Alright.

00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:22,001
Oh, you provide a pump,
as well?

00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:23,903
Yes, we provide
the pump, as well.

00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,704
So just grab onto
the handles.

00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:26,772
You can
hold on to the ones ‐‐

00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:27,940
Pretend like you're
catching a wave,

00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:31,510
'cause there's waves
right behind you.
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,979
Ooh!

00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:38,884
If I had my little one,
he would be here or she.

00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:39,752
‐Yeah.
‐Yeah.

00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:40,986
And then I would hang on.

00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:42,054
‐Right.
‐Yeah.

00:23:42,054 --> 00:23:44,990
You can do two people
side by side, too?

00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,692
‐Yes, two people side by side.
‐Adults?

00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:47,259
John:
Yep, we go side by side.

00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,161
We're side by side
in the video, as well.

00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:52,164
It's super fun.
Like, it feels very solid.

00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:55,334
Wow. So you guys
are this great family.

00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:58,737
I'm just curious, like,
who's running the business?

00:23:58,737 --> 00:23:59,939
What's the story?

00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,074
Well, we each
have our function.

00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:05,778
I'm in charge of manufacturing,
operations,

00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:08,247
logistics,
the website.

00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:11,216
And I'm in charge of marketing
and sales and social media.

00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:15,054
And I'm the CFO, which stands
for Chief Fun Officer.

00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:17,990
I make sure that our brand
stays in line with our vision.

00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,858
And I'm
the creative director.

00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:22,027
I'm in charge
of the merchandising.

00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:24,930
Alleanna: I'm in charge
of community outreach

00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,566
and then also making sure
everybody gets the job done.

00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:28,734
I'm the oldest sister.

00:24:28,734 --> 00:24:31,937
I just love your unity.

00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:34,139
Did you consciously
design something

00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,041
that you could
involve your daughters in?

00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:39,345
We had ‐‐ As a family growing up
in San Clemente, California,

00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:42,881
we had participated in so many
different water activities.

00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:44,783
There's actually a picture
of us,

00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:47,886
all five of us
on one stand‐up paddleboard.

00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:52,224
Herjavec: Oh, my gosh.
That is the cutest thing ever!

00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,059
Greiner: Do you have
a background in this?

00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:58,597
Yes. Well, John and I always
said that whatever he can sell

00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:00,899
I can make.

00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:04,536
I actually originally came here
to United States

00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:06,839
from Iran as a refugee.

00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,141
But by the time
I was 21,

00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:11,010
I had my industrial
engineering degree

00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:15,114
and was working in a big
corporation in manufacturing.
Wow.

00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:17,816
So I know how
to make products.

00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:21,820
Wow.
And John was always
a salesperson.

00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,923
So we decided
when Juliette was 6 months ‐‐

00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:26,825
we decided
to start a business,

00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:29,161
and what we started
was a shelving business.

00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:32,698
And it's been amazing
because our main object

00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,133
for having the company

00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:36,935
is to be able to spend time
with our kids.

00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:40,039
And it's been a success.
We are still running it.

00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:44,610
We do about $1,500,000
in sales per year.

00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:45,744
‐Wow.
‐Good for you.

00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:46,845
What do you
manufactured it for?

00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:48,914
The landed cost
is $150.

00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:50,916
O'Leary: $150?
And you sell it for how much?
Yes.

00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,951
We sell it for $459.

00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:54,219
‐Ooh.
‐Wow.

00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,256
This idea of packaging it
into something portable

00:25:57,256 --> 00:26:01,560
with the pump,
all‐in‐one‐fun kind of idea.

00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,194
This is all you need.

00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:03,996
Throw it in the back
of your scooter, your bike,

00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:05,097
take it to the beach.

00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:07,199
That's the selling proposition
to me,

00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:10,502
because there are
other products like this.

00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:13,138
Greiner: There are?
Don't be such a killjoy.
Herjavec: No, there are not.

00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,074
Shut him down.
John: Well, what is unique
about our product,

00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:16,909
We call it dynamic air design

00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:19,044
because the design
is what we've perfected.

00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:20,846
O'Leary:
But has anybody else done this?

00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:23,115
Done this exact thing?
No.

00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:24,216
John:
So we designed the board,

00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:26,085
and then we consulted
with our attorney,

00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:27,986
and we did file
for a patent,

00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:29,254
a utility patent
on this design.

00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,924
It has been submitted,
and that's for the whole design,

00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,892
incorporating the handles,
the locations,

00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:35,027
as well as the camera mount.

00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:37,930
Cuban: Who goes out selling,
or is it only online?

00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,331
How does the whole
sales process work?

00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:43,202
Well, it's been a bit different
this year due to the pandemic.

00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:46,138
So we had to pivot
towards selling online.

00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:48,107
And what we actually
ended up doing

00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,976
was we launched
a Kickstarter campaign

00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:52,911
as our first, like,
way of selling.

00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:54,646
So we did that
for one month,

00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:56,782
and we've done $43,000
in sales.

00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,750
Was that all on Kickstarter,
the $43,000?

00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,853
$31,000 was from
the Kickstarter,

00:27:00,853 --> 00:27:02,955
and that was between
June and July.

00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,089
‐Of this year?
‐Yes.

00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:05,224
‐Oh, you're brand‐new.
‐We're brand‐new.

00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:07,092
‐Oh, you're brand‐new. Got it.
‐Oh, okay.

00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:10,963
So the average boogie board
is 59, 69, 79 bucks,

00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:13,165
depending on size,
under $100 for sure.

00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:15,834
Are you getting a lot of
pushback on that price point?

00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:16,902
Alleanna:
That's a great question.

00:27:16,902 --> 00:27:20,005
What we found is that
this is comparable

00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:21,240
to low‐cost surfboards,

00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,075
and because you can have
two people on one board,

00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:24,810
it's not like every person
needs their own.

00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,879
Herjavec: Have you taken it
to the surf shops

00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:28,680
and places
where people rent?

00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,948
Have you tried that?

00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:32,117
Part of the sales come
from the four retail stores

00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:33,952
that we've already got
carrying our product.

00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:35,120
What do you
need the money for,

00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,889
and what do you
need a Shark for?

00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:38,957
Well, our plan is,
we do feel that the opportunity

00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:42,094
for Tandem Boogie is global,
and our plan is to grow.

00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:44,229
We would like to have
25 accounts set up this year

00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:46,932
so that we can reach
over $300,000 in sales.

00:27:46,932 --> 00:27:47,966
We think that's realistic.

00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:49,968
But how are you
gonna get there?

00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:52,204
Your biggest challenge
will be distribution, that's it.

00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:55,140
People will buy the product
if they see it.

00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,342
Based on my experience
in sales and marketing,

00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,912
I know how to set up dealers,
I know how to set up accounts.

00:27:59,912 --> 00:28:01,847
I will contact them personally
like we did.

00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:05,851
But, guys, you can't sell enough
just demo'ing the boards.

00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:07,920
While you're gonna get
some retail distribution,

00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,189
online will be where you
make your most money.

00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:12,057
You know, you guys know
Tower Paddle Board.

00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:14,927
What made it work
was the marketing ability,

00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:20,265
the fact that Stephan
is just an expert at SEO, right?

00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:23,735
That's what made it sell.
You've done this part.

00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:25,771
But the part you don't have
is that SEO,

00:28:25,771 --> 00:28:27,039
that sales skill, right?

00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,975
It's not that you can't figure
out, but you're not there yet.

00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:31,910
And so for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,680
So we're sorry that you're out.
We hope you reconsider.

00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,914
Appreciate it.
Thanks.

00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:39,051
Well, listen, I love the name.
I think it's fabulous.

00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:41,920
It's intuitive.
You know just what it is.

00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,289
But I feel like
with this product,

00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:47,092
I think there's gonna be
better Sharks up here for you.

00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:51,096
So for that reason,
I'm out.

00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:53,932
O'Leary:
We've had water sports products
in here for over a decade,

00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:56,001
and it's a tough grind

00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:59,137
to get this to be a $5 million,
$10 million business.

00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:03,375
And so I admire what
you've done, but I'm out.

00:29:06,612 --> 00:29:07,980
Let me tell you
what I think.

00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,815
Have you watched "Shark Tank"
for a while?

00:29:09,815 --> 00:29:10,916
‐Oh, yes.
‐Oh, yes.

00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,117
From Season 1.
We've all watched it
as a family.

00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:13,952
Do you remember a family
that came out,

00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:16,922
a dad with five sons
called Handboard?

00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:17,956
‐Yes.
‐Yeah.

00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:19,157
That was my investment.

00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:21,126
They were
the California dream.

00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:26,164
So it was a cross between
a paddleboard and a skateboard.

00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:29,067
And I learned a lot
with Handboards.

00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:31,637
But you have something
they didn't.
John: Right.

00:29:31,637 --> 00:29:32,771
You have a patent.

00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,107
I mean, for me,
that's really key.

00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:39,645
But I need a bigger chunk
of the company.

00:29:39,645 --> 00:29:42,047
'Cause it was a lot of work.

00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:48,253
So I'll give you the $100,000,
but I want...

00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:54,092
Well, I don't want 10%, John.
How much do I want?

00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:57,996
Well, Robert, it is
a Tandem Boogie concept,

00:29:57,996 --> 00:29:59,097
two people, right?

00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:01,199
So are you interested
in just going this alone

00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:02,968
as a solo Shark,
or would you like to have

00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,936
a Tandem Boogie partner
from the panel?

00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:06,805
Well, there's only
one other Shark left.

00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,807
It's Daniel.
Daniel, what do you think?

00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,842
Lubetzky: I'll tell you
my thoughts on this.

00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:12,978
I love you guys.

00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,980
This is a sport
that my family enjoys.

00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:18,950
My wife loves this stuff.
My kids love this stuff.

00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:22,654
I'm kind of the loser
in the family that's bad at it.

00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,189
I have online expertise.

00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:26,992
We sell over $100 million
online.

00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:30,929
If Robert would like me to come
in on this to provide support,

00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:36,702
I think we could do it for 25%
for the two of us.

00:30:36,702 --> 00:30:38,103
25% isn't enough.

00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:40,939
And I'm just being
completely sincere.

00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:43,875
It is a lot of work,
and it's gonna take a long time.

00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:46,044
$100,000 for 35%.

00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:49,681
If Daniel wants to come in
as part of that, happy to do it.

00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,852

she created a baby spoon,

some type of licensing to them.
