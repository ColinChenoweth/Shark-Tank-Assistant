control really is the key,

00:15:14,408 --> 00:15:16,343

a dozen different ways

00:15:16,343 --> 00:15:18,212

Yours having to do a code

00:15:19,346 --> 00:15:21,482
is going be outdated
very quickly, right,

00:15:21,482 --> 00:15:23,550
because it'll just be an app
that you walk up,

00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:27,121
it says, "Oh, I recognize my app
via Bluetooth, RF,

00:15:27,121 --> 00:15:27,788

Eric: Right.

that allows it to be unlocked.

00:15:31,658 --> 00:15:35,562

to go in terms of catching up
