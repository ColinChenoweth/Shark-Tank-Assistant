while working

at a three‐Michelin‐star
restaurant.

00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:08,838
We were directly in charge
of sourcing the finest

on the menu,

00:01:11,007 --> 00:01:14,811
especially the truffles,
the black gold of ingredients,

00:01:14,811 --> 00:01:17,780
so prized, there's been
a black market that's developed.

00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,583
We learned that you have to work
directly with truffle hunters.

00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:23,086
Otherwise, you could be
paying top dollar for fakes.

00:01:23,086 --> 00:01:26,589
We started this company
to help chefs and consumers

00:01:26,589 --> 00:01:27,657
source honest truffles

00:01:27,657 --> 00:01:29,926
and create our own line
of truffle products.

when a global pandemic hits

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:33,897
and you have...

00:01:33,897 --> 00:01:37,634
20 pounds of fresh truffles
on hand

a live cooking experience.

00:01:51,514 --> 00:01:53,650

want to learn how to make,

00:01:55,618 --> 00:01:57,687

So, myself and Tyler
are actually chefs.

00:03:36,052 --> 00:03:38,755

restaurants in the world.

That's the only <i>guide Michélin</i>
in America, right?

00:03:43,826 --> 00:03:44,961
Yep,
and we were crazy enough

00:03:44,961 --> 00:03:46,954
to think if we started
a truffle business

00:03:46,954 --> 00:03:48,601
that we could sell
enough truffles

00:03:48,601 --> 00:03:51,437
to one day make enough money
to open up our own restaurant.

00:03:51,437 --> 00:03:54,540
We took 9,999 euros,

00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,443
strapped it to my buddy's chest,
sent him to Europe,

00:03:57,443 --> 00:03:58,644
and he started
making relationships

00:03:58,644 --> 00:04:00,446
directly with
truffle hunters.

00:04:00,446 --> 00:04:03,349
And we started just hustling
every single day,

00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:04,784
door to door
selling truffles.

00:04:04,784 --> 00:04:08,521
But then in 2019, we knew in
order to scale this business,

00:04:08,521 --> 00:04:10,556
we had to launch
a truffle product line...

00:04:10,556 --> 00:04:12,758
Yep.
...because we needed
something shelf‐stable.

00:04:12,758 --> 00:04:16,429
So Jason and his wife actually
went on their honeymoon to Bali,

00:04:16,429 --> 00:04:17,630
and they met
this salt maker

00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,699
that makes this beautiful,
handcrafted sea salt.

00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:22,868
And I had been messing around
with this truffle powder.

00:04:22,868 --> 00:04:25,604
So when we mixed the truffle
powder with the salt,

00:04:25,604 --> 00:04:27,807
we knew that we had
a good product on our hands.

00:04:27,807 --> 00:04:30,342
And what do you sell it for?
What did it cost you?

00:04:30,342 --> 00:04:32,378
So we sell it
for $20 a jar.

00:04:32,378 --> 00:04:33,679
It costs us $2.80.

'Cause you've imputed a value
of $10 million on this business.

fresh truffles ‐‐ $65,000.

Year two ‐‐ $486,000.

And when COVID‐19 hit,

00:04:48,761 --> 00:04:50,896
every restaurant
we worked with was closed,

00:04:50,896 --> 00:04:53,732
and we had 20 pounds
of fresh truffles on hand.

00:04:53,732 --> 00:04:55,801

of five days.

‐So what did you do?
‐Oh.

00:05:01,774 --> 00:05:04,510

was in these truffles.

while looking at the truffles,

00:05:15,788 --> 00:05:17,923

"Well, what if we send

if we can find some truffles?"

And by noon that day,

00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,976
we had completely sold out
of all the truffles.

00:05:36,976 --> 00:05:40,746
Since then, this year, we've
done $1.4 million in sales.

is the kit,

various ingredients.

Where's your strong focus?

00:06:14,847 --> 00:06:16,582
Because there's two things.

00:06:16,582 --> 00:06:17,883
I'm not saying
you can't do them both.

00:06:17,883 --> 00:06:19,652
But how do you
see this going?

00:06:19,652 --> 00:06:21,587
We look at ourselves
as a full brand,

00:06:21,587 --> 00:06:24,823
so we put those truffle products
into our kits

00:06:24,823 --> 00:06:26,725
and teach people recipes using
our truffle products.

00:06:26,725 --> 00:06:28,928
But, guys, the challenge
is your cash flow, right?

00:06:28,928 --> 00:06:30,896
Because some things
don't seem to add up.

00:06:30,896 --> 00:06:32,831
So you did how much
year to date?

00:06:32,831 --> 00:06:34,667
Year to date would've been
$1.4 million.

00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:35,968
$1.4 million.
And what's your profit?

00:06:35,968 --> 00:06:39,838
So off of that $1.4 million,
we've netted $8,000.

00:06:39,838 --> 00:06:42,775
$8,000, okay.
Therein lies the rub.
$8,000 on $1.4 million?

00:06:42,775 --> 00:06:46,545
Right, okay, and so how much
cash do you have in the bank?

00:06:46,545 --> 00:06:48,147
We have $165,000.

00:06:48,147 --> 00:06:50,649
Okay, so, you guys, you see
your challenge here, right?

00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:52,117
Because you're caught
between two businesses.

00:06:52,117 --> 00:06:55,554
In one business, you're
very inventory‐heavy, right,

00:06:55,554 --> 00:06:56,855
which is
your various products.

00:06:56,855 --> 00:06:57,923
So what have you sold
this year?

00:06:57,923 --> 00:07:00,793

to encourage all of us to find
a way to find relaxation.

The stressful times

just accentuates our mission.

And in the years to come,

00:14:34,049 --> 00:14:36,051
we're gonna see
a lot of great things from them.

Hi, Sharks.
I'm Cindy Trevizo.

00:15:06,452 --> 00:15:07,553
And I'm Gabe Trevizo.

00:15:07,553 --> 00:15:09,455
We are from
Gilbert, Arizona.

00:15:09,455 --> 00:15:10,823
And we're seeking
$200,000

00:15:10,823 --> 00:15:13,859
for 10% equity
in our company, Suds2Go.

00:15:13,859 --> 00:15:16,829
As parents, we know taking
adorable little ones outside

00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:19,632
and keeping their hands clean,
it's impossible.

00:15:19,632 --> 00:15:22,601
But how do we clean
their germy little hands?

00:15:22,601 --> 00:15:25,805
Sanitizer?
It stings.

00:15:25,805 --> 00:15:27,940
Wipes?
They're always dried out.

00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,675
And we definitely
don't want to take them

00:15:29,675 --> 00:15:31,377
in the nasty
public restroom.

00:15:31,377 --> 00:15:32,511
The best way to clean
their hands

00:15:32,511 --> 00:15:35,648
is with doctor‐preferred
soap and water.

00:15:35,648 --> 00:15:37,950
That's why we created
Suds2Go,

00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:42,888
a revolutionary, portable,
and patented handwashing system

00:15:42,888 --> 00:15:47,493
that allows you to bring
real handwash anywhere you go.

00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:49,695
Both:
No sink, no problem.

00:15:49,695 --> 00:15:51,764
In our reusable
bottle version,

00:15:51,764 --> 00:15:54,633
simply fill this container
with water

00:15:54,633 --> 00:15:59,004
and this section
with your favorite foaming soap.

00:15:59,605 --> 00:16:02,074
Pump the soap.

00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:06,979
And pour to rinse.

00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,217
It's really that easy.

00:16:11,217 --> 00:16:11,684
Clever.

00:16:11,684 --> 00:16:13,586
We also have
a second version

00:16:13,586 --> 00:16:16,889
that's so tiny,
it can even fit in your pocket.

00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:22,027
And it press‐fits onto
a disposable water bottle.

00:16:22,027 --> 00:16:24,930
In these times, more than ever,
we can have the peace of mind

00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:27,766
knowing we're using the best,
most effective way

00:16:27,766 --> 00:16:29,735

off our hands.

Now, Sharks,
who's ready to join us

00:16:32,872 --> 00:16:34,940
in the hand‐hygiene
revolution?

00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,643
Because remember,
with Suds2Go...

00:16:37,643 --> 00:16:40,813
Both:
No sink, no problem.

00:16:40,813 --> 00:16:42,781
Cindy, how does the portable
little one work?

00:16:42,781 --> 00:16:45,284
Can you show us that?
This one, yes.

00:16:45,284 --> 00:16:46,519
It just presses on.

00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:47,887
And then...

00:16:47,887 --> 00:16:51,524
pumps soap, and then this one
is a little bit more ‐‐

00:16:51,524 --> 00:16:53,592
Oh, I see.
John: Oh, but that's cool.

00:16:53,592 --> 00:16:54,760
That really is smart.

00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,695
Herjavec:
How much soap does it hold?

00:16:56,695 --> 00:16:59,665
So that holds
about 30 pumps.

00:16:59,665 --> 00:17:01,667
So this is
our disposable product,

00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:02,868
and these are made
to fit

00:17:02,868 --> 00:17:05,504
directly onto any
disposable water bottle.

00:17:05,504 --> 00:17:06,772
How much is
the disposable one?

00:17:06,772 --> 00:17:09,341
Those sell in a two‐pack
for $10.99.

00:17:09,341 --> 00:17:09,875
‐Ooh.
‐Wow.

00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:10,943
‐That's not cheap.
‐That's expensive.

00:17:10,943 --> 00:17:12,878
‐That's a lot.
‐What's your cost on them?

00:17:12,878 --> 00:17:15,748
$2.25, landed, packaged.
That's good.

00:17:15,748 --> 00:17:16,916
And what's your cost
on this?

00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,817
And what do you sell it for
again?

00:17:18,817 --> 00:17:21,654
Landed, that's $7,
and packaged.

00:17:21,654 --> 00:17:23,522
And we sell it
for $36.99.

00:17:23,522 --> 00:17:24,790
Ooh, that's not cheap,
either.

00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,593
Tell us how you're
selling it today.

00:17:27,593 --> 00:17:30,729
We're selling only on
our website since February 1st.

00:17:30,729 --> 00:17:32,798
‐What good timing.
‐You're just around COVID.

00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:34,633
Greiner: I mean,
that was accidental, right?

00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:35,668
It was accidental.

00:17:35,668 --> 00:17:36,902
We ran a Kickstarter
in '18

00:17:36,902 --> 00:17:39,004
to kind of gauge
social proof for ourselves.

00:17:39,004 --> 00:17:41,807
We raised our $12,500,
which was our target.

00:17:41,807 --> 00:17:44,777
And we got our inventory
in December of '19.

00:17:44,777 --> 00:17:46,779
Wow.
So we got
our first 4,000 bottles.

00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:47,980
So how are sales going?

00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,915
Those 4,000 bottles,
how many did you sell?
They're gone.

00:17:49,915 --> 00:17:51,817
They lasted six weeks.
Six weeks.

00:17:51,817 --> 00:17:53,118
‐Six weeks? You sold out?
‐Good for you.

00:17:53,118 --> 00:17:54,987
Greiner: Wow.
And we have 12,000 more coming
at the end of the month.

00:17:54,987 --> 00:17:57,690
What are your
total sales so far?

00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:01,193
Lifetime sales ‐‐
$392,000.

00:18:02,294 --> 00:18:02,861
Wow.

00:18:02,861 --> 00:18:05,731
Tell me about you.
What's both your history?

00:18:05,731 --> 00:18:07,766
So our history
is interesting.

00:18:07,766 --> 00:18:09,835
We're eighth‐grade
sweethearts.

00:18:09,835 --> 00:18:12,805
Oh.
We've been through
a lot together.

00:18:12,805 --> 00:18:17,543
In '08, I lost my job.
Cindy was a teacher.

00:18:17,543 --> 00:18:18,877
And...Ah.

00:18:18,877 --> 00:18:24,016
So she picked up extra jobs
on the weekend as a waitress.

00:18:24,016 --> 00:18:27,553
And I basically did
whatever I could,

00:18:27,553 --> 00:18:30,889
which included valeting cars,
landscaping,

00:18:30,889 --> 00:18:35,461
portering,
which is picking up trash.

00:18:35,461 --> 00:18:36,929
And it was ‐‐
Sorry.

00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:38,797
It was a defining moment
for us,

00:18:38,797 --> 00:18:41,834
and it really lit a fire in
our bellies to be hard workers,

00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:47,006
to not let things get in the way
of where we want to go.

00:18:47,006 --> 00:18:48,774
Herjavec: You know, Gabe,
it's interesting.

00:18:48,774 --> 00:18:51,744
You know, "Shark Tank"
started in 2008.

00:18:51,744 --> 00:18:53,812
And I think one of the reasons
our show lasted

00:18:53,812 --> 00:18:55,781
is we inspired so many people

00:18:55,781 --> 00:18:59,718
in the midst of all that misery
and hardship.

00:18:59,718 --> 00:19:00,786
And here we are.

00:19:00,786 --> 00:19:03,022
And we're in
a global pandemic.

00:19:03,022 --> 00:19:05,758
And I hope we do
the same thing again.

00:19:05,758 --> 00:19:08,627
Where did you get the money
to do manufacturing?

00:19:08,627 --> 00:19:10,529
Was it all
from Kickstarter?

00:19:10,529 --> 00:19:11,930
No.
It was our money.

00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:16,669
So we've put in about $80,000
of our own money.

00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:17,736
‐Wow.
‐$80,000?

00:19:17,736 --> 00:19:19,271
Herjavec: Gabe, where did
you get the $80,000?

00:19:19,271 --> 00:19:21,974
Our bank account.
Our bank account.
We save money.

00:19:21,974 --> 00:19:24,076
‐Good for you.
‐So those were all your savings?

00:19:24,076 --> 00:19:25,844
Sure.
You're all‐in here, right?

00:19:25,844 --> 00:19:29,081
You basically wiped out your
savings to get to where you are.

00:19:29,081 --> 00:19:33,786
It means everything to us.
I mean, it's our dream.

00:19:33,786 --> 00:19:35,888
How much cash do you have
in the bank now?

00:19:35,888 --> 00:19:38,957
In the business account,
we have $90,000.

00:19:38,957 --> 00:19:40,726
‐Wow, good for you.
‐Wow.

00:19:40,726 --> 00:19:43,562
And we also have about $120,000
of paid inventory,

00:19:43,562 --> 00:19:46,465
which is a retail value
of $600,000.
Cuban: See, I mean,
that's just incredible.

00:19:46,465 --> 00:19:47,032
Think about that.

00:19:47,032 --> 00:19:49,101
Literally, since February,

00:19:49,101 --> 00:19:54,106
you went from, "Oh, no,"
to, "Oh, yes."

00:19:54,106 --> 00:19:57,142
Yeah.
That's incredible.
Incredible.

00:19:57,142 --> 00:19:58,944
And what do you need
the money for today?

00:19:58,944 --> 00:20:01,714
We need the money
to fast‐pace

00:20:01,714 --> 00:20:03,982
entering global markets
with distribution,

00:20:03,982 --> 00:20:05,884
and obviously inventory's
gonna cost a lot of money.

00:20:05,884 --> 00:20:07,886
Do you have any debt
on your business right now?

00:20:07,886 --> 00:20:09,121
We have no debt
on the business.

00:20:09,121 --> 00:20:14,560
We do have a personal loan that
we've drawn solely for Suds2Go.

00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,528
How big is it?
$150,000.

00:20:16,528 --> 00:20:17,696
Oh!
$150,000?

00:20:17,696 --> 00:20:18,831
Greiner:
So you've put in $80,000.

00:20:18,831 --> 00:20:20,299
That was all our modes.
That was our engineer designs.

00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:22,401
That was the first run
of inventory.
And you have a patent, I see,

00:20:22,401 --> 00:20:25,003
which isn't cheap, right?
I loved the story so much more
before the $150,000.

00:20:25,003 --> 00:20:26,739
And the patent.
Greiner:
Is that a utility patent?

00:20:26,739 --> 00:20:28,173
It's a utility patent
for both products.

00:20:28,173 --> 00:20:32,678
So can anybody else
add a pump dispense?
No, absolutely not.

00:20:32,678 --> 00:20:33,812
The money's gonna be used

00:20:33,812 --> 00:20:35,948
for hopefully entering
other markets, okay?

00:20:35,948 --> 00:20:38,117
If we can find
distribution possibilities

00:20:38,117 --> 00:20:41,987
in other countries, this is
a product that'll just explode.

00:20:41,987 --> 00:20:44,123
Gabe and Cindy, I have good news
and I have bad news.

00:20:44,123 --> 00:20:47,993
Good news is, I have a product
like this called Blueland.

00:20:47,993 --> 00:20:51,864
That business was a retail
business until COVID hit.

00:20:51,864 --> 00:20:55,067
Now it's doing $3 million
a month online direct.

00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:57,970
It's way beyond
anybody's expectations,

00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:00,939
and they're expanding
their product line wildly.

00:21:00,939 --> 00:21:02,074
I can't invest in you.

00:21:02,074 --> 00:21:05,477
That's a direct competitor
to what I'm doing.

00:21:05,477 --> 00:21:06,011
I'm out.

00:21:06,011 --> 00:21:07,012
Thank you, Kevin.
Thank you, Kevin.

00:21:07,012 --> 00:21:08,147
We appreciate ‐‐
Cuban: You guys, look.

00:21:08,147 --> 00:21:10,149
I think what you have
accomplished is incredible.

00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:15,020
The challenge for me
is that while it's very timely,

00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,155
I've just seen so many people

00:21:16,155 --> 00:21:18,090
trying to get into
the same space.

00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,993
You know, you may be able
to patent it for this look.

00:21:20,993 --> 00:21:22,795
But there are a variety
of different ways

00:21:22,795 --> 00:21:24,263
to maybe accomplish
the same thing.

00:21:24,263 --> 00:21:26,932
But it's gonna be a challenge
as an investor.

00:21:26,932 --> 00:21:29,268
I just don't know the path
that I can take you on.

00:21:29,268 --> 00:21:31,904
So for those reasons, I'm out.
But congratulations.

00:21:31,904 --> 00:21:32,905
Thank you so much, Mark.
Thank you, Mark.

00:21:32,905 --> 00:21:35,207
You're welcome.
Thank you.

00:21:35,207 --> 00:21:37,776
Herjavec: I think there's
gonna be a lot of people

00:21:37,776 --> 00:21:40,045
in this space very quickly.

00:21:40,045 --> 00:21:41,847
And it could crush you,

00:21:41,847 --> 00:21:43,015
and I'm not trying
to be negative,

00:21:43,015 --> 00:21:46,652
but it's staying
ahead of that.
Right.

00:21:46,652 --> 00:21:48,353
I'm out.

00:21:50,088 --> 00:21:51,990
John: I'm interested
in this business,

00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:54,760
and I can help you
with the distribution.

00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,095
I'll make you an offer.

00:21:57,095 --> 00:21:59,097
Usually there'd be
three of us

00:21:59,097 --> 00:22:01,099
and I'd want to go in a third,
a third, and a third.

00:22:01,099 --> 00:22:04,002
But because I think that,
first of all,

00:22:04,002 --> 00:22:05,137
a teacher is one
of the country's

00:22:05,137 --> 00:22:07,005
most underappreciated
commodities,

00:22:07,005 --> 00:22:11,707
I'm willing to go in
for $200,000 for 22.5%.

00:22:12,683 --> 00:22:14,624

$49,000.

00:27:07,653 --> 00:27:09,788

So what happened was, we got a
ton of great press in the fall.

00:27:14,693 --> 00:27:17,496
We were written up
in <i>The New York Times,</i>

00:27:17,496 --> 00:27:18,998
<i>The Boston Globe,</i> NPR.

00:27:18,998 --> 00:27:22,334
When the NPR story hit
two weeks before Christmas,

00:27:22,334 --> 00:27:23,068
it went bananas,

00:27:23,068 --> 00:27:25,905
and I sold through
almost all of my inventory,

00:27:25,905 --> 00:27:29,708
and then COVID
shut down my factory.

00:27:29,708 --> 00:27:32,511
And so they were on back order
for months and months.

00:27:32,511 --> 00:27:33,646
So you have the demand.

00:27:33,646 --> 00:27:34,947
You just haven't had the product
to fulfill it.

00:27:34,947 --> 00:27:39,752

it's been in the market

00:28:34,006 --> 00:28:35,975
when really what they
should be doing

is taking it behind the barn
and shooting it.

of person that buys it once,

00:29:05,771 --> 00:29:08,007

being that consumer...
Okay.

My concern is, unless you expand
into other products,

you busted your butt
to go out and get PR

00:29:48,981 --> 00:29:50,749

your inventory,

the exact way to do it.

how you're gonna sell it

00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,055

You haven't said, "I know
exactly what I'm doing."

00:29:58,991 --> 00:30:01,126
So I don't see a path
where I could

00:30:01,126 --> 00:30:03,829
just take this product
and run with it.

I wrap it up in paper towels

like, kind of getting dry.

00:30:14,306 --> 00:30:18,811

on the fence here about this.

Yeah.

have a decent market

too.

Some of those patents just cover
some other applications,

And while that's going,

00:35:43,126 --> 00:35:45,294
I'll show you a video
of how that works.

00:35:45,294 --> 00:35:47,597
Traditional water pitchers
use a filter.

00:35:47,597 --> 00:35:50,466
And the biggest problem is that
they only trap contaminates,

00:35:50,466 --> 00:35:53,202
where they could quickly
accumulate and multiply

00:35:53,202 --> 00:35:55,204
and actually reverse‐contaminate
your water.

00:35:55,204 --> 00:35:57,173
Why do they
reverse‐contaminate?

00:35:57,173 --> 00:35:58,574
Because the contaminants
are being trapped

00:35:58,574 --> 00:36:00,610
and collected there,
and as germs are growing,

00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:03,479
there is a wet, porous
environment that's dark.

00:36:03,479 --> 00:36:05,481
So imagine all the things
that could be growing there.

00:36:05,481 --> 00:36:07,316
So we take
a two‐step approach.

00:36:07,316 --> 00:36:08,584
The first step,
you see it go through,

00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:12,255
and it captures things
like lead, cadmium, mercury.

00:36:12,255 --> 00:36:14,290
In the second step,
you simply press this button,

00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:16,225
and it'll purify the water
that's gone through.

00:36:16,225 --> 00:36:19,362
And as you can see,
that is clear water

00:36:19,362 --> 00:36:20,563
that we poured blue water in
that's contaminated.

00:36:20,563 --> 00:36:23,132
So clear water, but is
anybody else doing this?

00:36:23,132 --> 00:36:24,133
No one's doing this.

00:36:24,133 --> 00:36:25,434

00:37:16,352 --> 00:37:19,288
because I just think that I'm
here for a different reason.

00:37:19,288 --> 00:37:21,524
I think this is crazy.

00:37:21,524 --> 00:37:24,026
I'll let the other Sharks
discuss it.

00:37:24,026 --> 00:37:25,428
But I'm out.

00:37:25,428 --> 00:37:27,630
I also come from a background
where I didn't have a lot.

00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,465
It's unfortunate that you won't
take that journey with me.

00:37:29,465 --> 00:37:30,566
But I respect
what you're saying.

00:37:30,566 --> 00:37:32,435
So let me
take a shot at it.

00:37:32,435 --> 00:37:34,470
I support a charity
called One Drop.

00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,472
Making sure everybody can drink
fresh water around the world

00:37:36,472 --> 00:37:37,707
is something
I can get behind.

00:37:37,707 --> 00:37:41,077
Love to be involved in this,
but I'm not doing it for 1%.

00:37:41,077 --> 00:37:42,478
I bring too much value.

00:37:42,478 --> 00:37:46,148
I've never done a deal for 1%
for obvious reasons.

00:37:46,148 --> 00:37:47,650
I'll do it for 4%.

00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:49,552
I don't care
how you structure it ‐‐

00:37:49,552 --> 00:37:51,554
advisory shares,
whatever.

00:37:51,554 --> 00:37:54,490
So you want him to do it
at almost one‐third

00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:55,725
of his last round?
I understand.

00:37:55,725 --> 00:37:59,295
I didn't say <i>you</i> would
like it, Mark, or you would.

00:37:59,295 --> 00:38:00,630
I'm just telling you
what I would do.

00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,598
Is there other offers
out there?

00:38:02,598 --> 00:38:06,702
Greiner: You know, to give you
half a million dollars for 1%,

00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:08,738
I feel like
I'm not making anything.

00:38:08,738 --> 00:38:11,307
The category that we're in
is gigantic.

00:38:11,307 --> 00:38:12,808
It's a $300 billion industry.

00:38:12,808 --> 00:38:16,545
And it's so ripe for disruption
and so ripe for innovation.

00:38:16,545 --> 00:38:17,813
Honestly here, like ‐‐

00:38:17,813 --> 00:38:19,749
I'm willing to take offers
and listen to counteroffers.

00:38:19,749 --> 00:38:22,084
‐Make an offer, Lori.
‐Make an offer, Lori.

00:38:23,286 --> 00:38:25,288
I would love to work with you.
I would love it.

00:38:25,288 --> 00:38:27,790
$500,000 for 5%.

00:38:28,557 --> 00:38:31,243
[ Laughs ] You keep on
going backwards, Justin.

00:38:31,243 --> 00:38:33,141
Herjavec:
Justin, the problem with 1%

00:38:33,141 --> 00:38:35,176
is you're priced
for perfection.

00:38:35,176 --> 00:38:38,046
And, yes, I would love
to own 1% of Apple,

00:38:38,046 --> 00:38:40,348
and I would love
to own 1% of Tesla.

00:38:40,348 --> 00:38:44,052
But the odds
are just so low.

00:38:44,052 --> 00:38:46,054
To make it easier
for your investors,

00:38:46,054 --> 00:38:48,423
I'll do $500,000 for 3%.

00:38:48,423 --> 00:38:52,227
We can work out the other 2%
from your advisory pool.

00:38:52,227 --> 00:38:54,029
Mm‐hmm.
That's my offer.

00:38:54,029 --> 00:38:55,130
O'Leary:
And, Mark, are you anywhere?

00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,364
Yeah,
I know where I'm at.

00:38:56,364 --> 00:38:58,166
So, look, there's
different platforms

00:38:58,166 --> 00:38:59,334
for different reasons,
right?

00:38:59,334 --> 00:39:01,269
This is a place
where people come

00:39:01,269 --> 00:39:03,371
where they just need
a little bit more fuel,

00:39:03,371 --> 00:39:05,173
they need
a little bit of help.

00:39:05,173 --> 00:39:07,008
We're not here
to evaluate companies

00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,410
that may be billion dollars
in sales

00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:12,280
over a trillion‐dollar market
in 20 years, which is possible,

00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,115
but this is not
the place to do it.

00:39:14,115 --> 00:39:16,151
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:39:16,151 --> 00:39:18,453
So you have three offers.
What do you want to do?

00:39:18,453 --> 00:39:20,455
You know, the offers
are all great

00:39:20,455 --> 00:39:22,323
but, even without
the advisory shares,

00:39:22,323 --> 00:39:26,394
below my last valuation
of $32 million‐ish, right?

00:39:26,394 --> 00:39:27,729
To be honest with you,
that's really my bottom line.

00:39:27,729 --> 00:39:32,233
What about we got you all in
for half a million dollars each

00:39:32,233 --> 00:39:37,372
for $1.5 million total
at 4.5%?

00:39:37,372 --> 00:39:40,341
And I will also throw in
advisory share of 1%

00:39:40,341 --> 00:39:42,243
split between the three of you.

00:39:42,243 --> 00:39:45,980
So for a total, it would be 5.5%
for that money.

00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,048
2%.

00:39:47,048 --> 00:39:48,416
Yeah.

00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:50,351
Okay, here's
something we'll do.

00:39:50,351 --> 00:39:54,222
Would you consider $1.5 million
for 6% and each Shark gets 2%?

00:39:54,222 --> 00:39:56,558
♪♪

00:39:56,558 --> 00:39:59,794
You get three Sharks,
huge value for you.

00:40:08,036 --> 00:40:09,237
Narrator:
Two Sharks are out.

00:40:09,237 --> 00:40:11,339
And Justin has one offer
on the table

00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:13,141
from Kevin, Lori, and Robert

00:40:13,141 --> 00:40:16,311
for his water‐purification
company, LARQ.

00:40:16,311 --> 00:40:18,079
Huge value for you.

00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:22,917
$1.5 million,
$500,000 each, for 6%.

00:40:22,917 --> 00:40:24,452
What say you?

00:40:24,452 --> 00:40:26,488
I could accept the offer
with one condition ‐‐

00:40:26,488 --> 00:40:31,960
that structured in a way
that $1.5 million for 4.5%

00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,328
and the remaining 1.5%

00:40:33,328 --> 00:40:36,397
would be advisory shares
to be divided among you.

00:40:36,397 --> 00:40:40,535
My question is, do I get 2%
for my $500,000?
You do.

00:40:40,535 --> 00:40:43,404
How long is the vesting period
for the advisory shares?

00:40:43,404 --> 00:40:44,739
24 months.
Based on what?

00:40:44,739 --> 00:40:47,242
Forget the vesting period.
Greiner: Yeah, what are you
basing that on?

00:40:47,242 --> 00:40:49,444
Like, what do I have to do
to get my advisory shares?

00:40:49,444 --> 00:40:51,312
I think we just have
a conversation

00:40:51,312 --> 00:40:52,480
about what we could do
with the business,

00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,048
how we could build it
together.

00:40:54,048 --> 00:40:55,183
Oh, God.
Maybe it's QVC.

00:40:55,183 --> 00:40:56,217
Maybe it's
developing channels.

00:40:56,217 --> 00:40:57,418
Justin, let me make it
very simple.

00:40:57,418 --> 00:40:59,220
It's too complicated.
You know what?

00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,421
I'm out

00:41:00,421 --> 00:41:03,458
because I've worked really hard
to get to this point.

00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:06,394
I don't need you
to interview me.

00:41:06,394 --> 00:41:09,130
Greiner: I don't want
contingencies on it.

00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:10,465
You know that we're
going to be involved.

00:41:10,465 --> 00:41:13,034
We don't want to see that
just evaporate.

00:41:13,034 --> 00:41:14,269
Absolutely, absolutely.

00:41:14,269 --> 00:41:17,272
I'm in for 2%.
for $500,000.

00:41:17,272 --> 00:41:21,309
I'll do $1 million for 4%
split between you and Lori.

00:41:21,309 --> 00:41:23,044
I'm in.

00:41:23,044 --> 00:41:26,181
No advisory,
just straight?

00:41:26,181 --> 00:41:28,516
Advisory will just vest.
No contingencies.

00:41:28,516 --> 00:41:30,618
So half a million dollars each
for 1.5%

00:41:30,618 --> 00:41:34,222
plus .5% in advisory shares,
2% total.

00:41:34,222 --> 00:41:35,490
I don't want
advisory shares.

00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:37,458
I like just the equity.
Can you do that?

00:41:37,458 --> 00:41:40,195
Look, I want her
part of the deal for sure.

00:41:40,195 --> 00:41:41,496
I see lots of value here.

00:41:41,496 --> 00:41:44,566
Whatever it takes to get her
on board, I want the same.

00:41:44,566 --> 00:41:48,169
So are you putting a stake
in the sand here?

00:41:48,169 --> 00:41:49,504
Yeah, I would go 2%.

00:41:49,504 --> 00:41:51,339
Okay, well,
that's what we got to do.

00:41:51,339 --> 00:41:53,241
But not advisory shares.

00:41:53,241 --> 00:41:55,243
What if those shares
just vested up front?

00:41:55,243 --> 00:41:56,311
'Cause I have to
structure something

00:41:56,311 --> 00:41:59,013
where I'm not going below
my last valuation.

00:41:59,013 --> 00:42:00,315
It's 2% up front.

00:42:00,315 --> 00:42:01,349
Done.

00:42:01,349 --> 00:42:03,318
Done. Alright.

00:42:03,318 --> 00:42:04,385
Yes!

Congratulations, Justin.
Good luck.

00:42:09,757 --> 00:42:12,327
It feels like I was just in the
trenches, but I'm so excited.

I know we're gonna go places.
Whoo!

00:42:14,329 --> 00:42:15,697
I knew they were interested,
and, you know,

00:42:15,697 --> 00:42:17,865
I thought that I was gonna
lose them for a second.

00:42:17,865 --> 00:42:22,403
But I'm so glad both Lori and
Kevin ended up coming across,

00:42:22,403 --> 00:42:25,249
and having those guys
in my corner is just so awesome.

00:42:25,249 --> 00:42:26,751
