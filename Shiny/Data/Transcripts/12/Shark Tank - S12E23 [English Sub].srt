00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:57,651

"You know,

this is a crazy idea
without any merit."

00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,022
But the more I heard the story
and the fact

00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:04,724
that you actually sold
over $200,000 worth of them,

00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,726

00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,893
Add your choice of liquid
to the mix,

00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,763
then your favorite nut butter
or syrup.

00:14:56,763 --> 00:15:00,800
One of the best parts
is you control the sugar.

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,937
So whether you're keto, paleo,
vegan, or gluten free,

00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:09,375
personalizing your snack
is as easy as one, two, three.

00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,778
All that's left to do is mix.

00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:15,948
And then you're gonna roll...

00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,284
...and take a bite.

00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:18,985
That's cool.

00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:22,054
Creation Nation is leading
a DIY snack revolution.

00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:25,792
So who's ready to raise the bar
with me and have a ball?

00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:27,560
Wow.
Rodriguez: Wow.

00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,364
So, the ones on your left
were made keto style,

00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:32,098
with just almond butter.

00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:35,635
The energy bite mixes, we made
with peanut butter and honey.

00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:37,503
Except for yours, Lori. There's
no peanut butter in yours.

00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:38,738
Thank you.

00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:41,474
Mark, all of yours
are our vegan mixes.
Cool.

00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:42,575
And how much protein?

00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:45,511
It's between 12
to 16 grams of protein

00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:46,712
for a full‐size bar

00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:49,715
or about five grams of protein
per ball.

00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:51,350
Rodriguez:
They're very good.
They're actually
really good.

00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,618
Very tasty.

00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,454
So, how has the market
received this?

00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,388
How are you selling?

00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:56,756
So, we sell online.

00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:58,624
One of our first retail partners

00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,661
was one of the big
e‐commerce sellers.

00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:04,831
Now we're also in Whole Foods
Market on the West Coast,

00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:08,634
Costco in the Midwest,
and Walmart on the East Coast.

00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,902
O'Leary:
Are these regional tests?

00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,671
How come there's
no national rollouts?
Nation: Yeah, so ‐‐

00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:14,540
We haven't gone national yet,

00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,776
so we're still
in less than 500 stores.

00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:18,478
What does it cost me
to buy this?

00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:19,712
What does it cost you
to make it?

00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:22,515
Nation:
So, it's $2.00 to $3.50,

00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:24,650
depending on which product,
to make it.

00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,019
And they retail between $7.00
and $11.00.

00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,055
I'm wondering ‐‐ How did you
come up with this concept?

00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:31,491
Well, I've really been obsessed
with nutrition

00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,592
since I was a kid.

00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,727
I spent some years
in the foster‐care system,

00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,763
and the families really couldn't
accommodate my food allergies.

00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:40,800
So I just didn't eat
or I ate a candy bar,

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,770
and I was constantly falling
asleep in class or always sick.

00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,573
But I am
a very determined person,

00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:50,643
and I pretty much self‐studied
my way to health

00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:53,579
and later became certified
in sports nutrition.

00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,748
Karen, why were you in
the foster‐care system,

00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,717
and what was that like?

00:16:57,717 --> 00:17:01,621
Well, um...
Well, yeah.

00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:04,757
Family life at that time
wasn't a good situation,

00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:07,693
so the courts decided
it was safer for me

00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,629
to live in foster care.

00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:10,763
The families were nice,

00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,632
but it's, you know,
it's not your family.

00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:13,799
It's not your home.
No. Of course.

00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:14,934
It's definitely
very different.

00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:17,770
One of the many jobs I held ‐‐
I was a house mother

00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,706
for 14 children
in foster care.

00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,742
And I had that job
for about a year and a half.
Wow.

00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:26,379
And these kids developed
such a sense of value

00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,548
that changed them forever.

00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:29,815
You learn a lot
through that.

00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:32,184
You learn to care for yourself,
I think.

00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:32,752
Mm‐hmm.

00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:35,354
What's revenue going to be
this calendar year?

00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:36,556
At least $500,000.

00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:37,890
We did $500,000 last year,

00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,991
and we're set to do
at least that or more.

00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,460
Well, you would hope you'd grow
year over year.

00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,728
Was there any profits?

00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,430
We're pretty much break even
all the time.

00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,531
We run on cash flow.

00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,867
Cuban: Are there other
no‐bake products?
No.

00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:50,703
The question then becomes
why haven't you sold more?

00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:51,904
Yeah.
What's holding you back?

00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,440
We went to trade shows,
and we had all this interest,

00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,675
all this momentum.

00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:57,643
We hit a major
co‐packer problem.

00:17:57,643 --> 00:18:00,012
They breached our contract
in a variety of ways.

00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:03,950
I had very specific stipulations
about the shelf life

00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,419
of the ingredient they were
putting in our product.

00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,053
They didn't follow that.

00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:09,755
So in other words, they
didn't follow your instruction,

00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,624
you shipped out a bunch
with the ‐‐

00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:13,359
let's call it
tainted product.

00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,595
Correct.
And what happened?

00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:18,798
So, we did a lot
of withdrawals.

00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:22,268
It was just not
to our quality standards.

00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,336
I pivoted quickly.

00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:23,936
I got a new co‐packer

00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,439
we've now been with
for a year and a half,

00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,707
and they've been amazing.

00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:30,076
By the end of last year,
we were doing great.

00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:33,479
And then with COVID,
things kind of changed. Um ‐‐

00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:34,680
So I pivoted again.
Why wouldn't this be

00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,816
a great product for home
at COVID?
Yes.

00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:40,586
So I pivoted our strategy
to e‐commerce,

00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:41,787
and we've tripled our sales.

00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,055
Wow. Good for you.
Rodriguez: Wow.

00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:46,859
Last month, how much did you do
from wholesale?

00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,894
We're about a 50/50 model
right now.

00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,763
Just last month.
Last month.

00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:54,533
I don't know the number off
the top of my head. I'm sorry.

00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:55,668
Did you guys make money
last month?

00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:56,769
Absolutely.
Yes.

00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:59,705
We made about a total
of $30,000.

00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:01,974
Good for you.
And what do you expect to make
by year end?

00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,710
I'm expecting to do
at least $500,000.

00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,845
We've already done $330,000 ‐‐

00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:08,514
Money that you can take
as profit in your pocket.

00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,583
Money you could put
in your pocket

00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,218
and say, "Hey,
I got this money out."

00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:14,654
If you're gonna sell $500,000 ‐‐
Not sales.
Not sales, but profits.

00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:18,591
If you sell $500,000,
what will you have in the bank?

00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:21,494
I‐I put the money
back into the business.

00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,562
I mean, our margins are 40%
to 50%.

00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,564
This is a basic question
in investing.

00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:28,968
You're gonna sell $500,000 worth
of this stuff.

00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:31,971
Are you going to profit
from that enterprise?

00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:35,641
No. No. We ‐‐
Everything that we profit ‐‐

00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:38,344
Took me a long time
to get that out of you.

00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,812
I run a very lean business.

00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:40,980
She's not answering.
Everything that we make,
we put back into marketing.

00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,717
Listen. If you don't know what
the definition of profit is,

00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:46,752
you're in the wrong place,
okay?

00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:48,287
I...
I'm out.

00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:51,824
Well, listen.
I like healthier food.

00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:53,893
But sometimes I just go
with my gut.

00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:55,795
I like the product.
I like you.

00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:57,663
But I don't think it's
the right investment for me.

00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:59,432
And so for that reason,
I'm out.

00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:01,734
Thank you, Lori.
I appreciate it.

00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:05,604
I really like your mission.
I like everything you stand for.

00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:09,542
Your story is really amazing
and aspirational.

00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,644
But when I look to invest
in a business,

00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:15,581
I look for someone to know
the numbers inside and out.

00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:18,250
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,653
Well, Karen,
you still have two Sharks in.
Barbara, do you like this
at all?

00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:21,854
Barbara and Mark.
I love the product.

00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:23,723
And just a piece of advice.
What frightens me ‐‐

00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,024
If I'm gonna write you a check
for $300,000...

00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:27,560
It's too high a price.
...and you're not remembering
the numbers,

00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,728
that scares me.

00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,363
Corcoran: Karen, Mark wants me
to go in on this deal,

00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:32,631
but there's no money
in it.

00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:35,634
And that's a basic requirement
I have for investing.

00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:36,902
We have great margins.
Like ‐‐

00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:40,439
But it doesn't find its way
into your pocket eventually

00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:41,974
over the years so far.

00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:45,177
I‐I must be missing
something basic, but I'm out.

00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,981
This is a pantry staple
that bridges the gap

00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:51,584
between nutritional powders
and grocery products ‐‐

00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,619
Yeah.
Karen, I wish ‐‐

00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:54,920
I'm trying to get there,
but I just can't.

00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,756
The real product here
is fun,

00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,023
but that's going to be
a lot of work.

00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,626
So for those reasons, I'm out.
I'm sorry.

00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:03,362
I know I'm gonna regret this,
but I'm out.

00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:07,533
Thank you.

00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:09,268
Congrats, Karen.
Congrats.
Terrific.

00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,302
Congratulations.

00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,304
♪♪

00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,006
Ugh.

00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:16,942
I'm a bit worried about her.
Rodriguez: I am too.

00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,378
I think she's gonna take
this rejection pretty hard.

00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,280
I'm gonna check up on her.

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,515
Oh, Barb.

00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:23,716
Corcoran:
Wonder where she is.

00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:26,752
Shark or no Shark, I'm gonna
keep doing what I'm doing.

00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:29,822
And, you know, we have
first‐mover advantage here,

00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:32,358
and I'm just gonna
keep going.

00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:33,025
Yeah.
Hey, Karen.

00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:36,662
I didn't want you to leave
here ‐‐ I hope you don't mind.

00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:39,765
I didn't want you to leave here
thinking that you failed.

00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:43,636
Thank you.
That you were able to stand up
to everybody was remarkable.

00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,572
You've held your cool,
and you knew your numbers,

00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:47,840
contrary to what Kevin
was saying.
I do.

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,842
So you should be walking
out of here

00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:51,510
totally proud
of who you are.

00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,845
Thank you, Barbara.
I really appreciate that.

00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:54,613
I've worked really hard.
Because you're gonna inspire
everybody

00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:55,614
who's watching the show.

00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:56,715
You're gonna be shocked

00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:58,684
at the inspiration
you're gonna provide people.

00:21:58,684 --> 00:21:59,952
Okay.

First thing you do
is you take your MKR Kit.

00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:26,731
You connect the bag
into the machine,

00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,701
open it all up,
pour in your grain.

00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:30,835

is basically fill the entire
machine up with water,

00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:35,807
close it all,
press the button on the front.

BeerMKR is going to bring up the
temperature inside the machine,

mashing those grains and liquid
and creating wort,

00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:43,848

So, first and foremost,
we love beer.

00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,868
I was a home brewer
for 15 years.

00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:48,807
And, you know, honestly,
we met at Cornell.

00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:51,309
Brett and I were in
the business school together,

00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,445
and we started the company

00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:55,046
in an entrepreneurship class
at Cornell.

00:36:55,046 --> 00:37:00,318
And it was for home‐brewing
temperature‐control devices.

00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:01,486
You're Cornell MBAs?

00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:02,487
Yes, sir.
Correct.

00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:04,756
So break down the numbers
for me.

00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:07,759
Sure.
So this costs us $375 to make.

00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:09,961
And it retails for $499.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:13,164
It cost you $375 for all‐in,
all the pieces...

Yep.

$499.

00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:21,740
How can you sell it so cheap?
That's no margin.

00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,408
Right. Right.
So, we have
two revenue streams.

00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,610
One is the machine
and one is the MKR Kit.
I get the replacement
of consumables and all that.

00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:26,845
What we want to do
is we make sure

00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:28,913
we get as many machines
out in the public as possible.

00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,449
Okay. That's fine. So we'll
go into the consumables.

00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:32,450
Exactly.
Yep. Yep. Exactly.

00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,685
So the consumable side
of things,

00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:37,956
it costs us $9 to $10
per ingredient kit.

00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:41,593
At scale, we can get that down
to $7 per kit.
