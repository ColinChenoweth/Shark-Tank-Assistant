00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:26,847
Now, we had to do
some research

00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:29,483
to figure out
what we should craft for you.

00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,551
We think these make great
starting‐out points.

00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,819
So, Mark, word around
the league

00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,689
is that you prefer
fill pillows over foam pillows,

00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:37,758
and you like your pillows
to be really soft.

00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,359
So we made sure
to craft that for you.

00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:39,926
Squishy, squishy, squishy.

00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:40,961
‐Nice.
‐I like my pillow squishy.

Daniel, we heard
how important it is

00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:45,766
for your sleep products

00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:47,734
The good news is,
all of our pillows are.

00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:51,471
We crafted a pillow for you
that's both light and soft.

00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,807
Mr. Wonderful,
we heard that you prefer

00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:55,809
fill pillows
over foam pillows,

00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:57,644
so we made one for you
that's just that,

00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,613
but one
that never flattens.

00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:01,648
Lori, you tend to
heat up at night

00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,884

a medium firmness level.

And lastly, Robert,
lucky you,

as Mr. Wonderful.

Pluto pillow.

00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,232
Susana, I have a question.

00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:20,000
I always assumed

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,670
that there was actually
a better pillow for everyone.

00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,938
Are you saying that
that's not the case,

00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:28,809
that really, truly, there is no
scientific best for everybody?

00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:30,677
There isn't.
So, we take your body stats,

00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:32,479
sleep positions,
and preferences,

00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,647
so we know that,
like, let's say,

00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:35,382
if you're a side‐sleeper,

00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,683
you need that, like,
neck support

00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,785
for the neck to
shoulder tip ratio,

00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:39,986
whereas, like,
a stomach sleeper,

00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,955
it's better if you sleep
on a flat pillow.

00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:44,825
But besides that, we also
have empirical evidence,

00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:47,394
we have over 1.5 million
data points

00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,628
that we take into account,

00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,630
of, like, what makes
a great pillow for you.

00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,733
What do you mean by those
1.5 million data points?

00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,634
So, we have an algorithm
on our site

00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,636
that, every time anyone
goes on our website,

00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,705
orders a pillow,
we store this information,

00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,640
and then we look
at other people

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,843
who answer similarly
to that person.

00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,911
And then we see, like,
exactly what kind of pillow

00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,847
would be best for them
with this data point.

00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:09,850
And this has actually led to
a very low return rate

00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,551
compared to
the industry average.

00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,687
The industry average
is 12.95%,

00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:16,656
while ours is sub‐8%,
and we did this in two years.

00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,458
Break down the numbers for me.

00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,228
2018, 197K
when we first started.

00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:23,430
2019, 473K.

00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,499
And this year so far
is 490K.

00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:26,733
‐There you go!
‐Wow.

00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,602
What's the average
sales price?

00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,704
We sell our
standard sizes for $95.

00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:32,572
How are you manufacturing?

00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:33,607
So, how this works is,

00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:34,741
if you guys open up
your pillows,

00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,676
inside, there's
actually a foam core,

00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:39,479
and it's surrounded by
a plush outer cover.

00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:40,680
So there's these
two main parts,

00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,649
and through
our questionnaire,

00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:43,784
when it goes through
our algorithm,

00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,018
the computer actually
decides, like,

00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,688
"Hey, this person needs this
foam with that plush cover."

00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:51,057
So someone's
in the facility picking,

00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,560
putting it together,
and packing.
Yeah, they just pick it,
put it together, and box it.

00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,729
Just two components
and variations

00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:56,830
of those two components?

00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,565
Yeah, two components make
over 35 variations

00:04:58,565 --> 00:04:59,800
that feel really different.

00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,802
One pillow,
you sell it at $95.

00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,603
Yes.
And then what does it
cost you,

00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:04,738
including fulfillment?

00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:06,706
And what is your ‐‐
what do you have left?

00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,875
So, $95 ‐‐
$18 shipping,

00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:12,612
and it cost us $25 to $30
to make the pillow.

00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:15,816
So $43.
So you only have
about 50% margin.

00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,717
Yes, so with that,
it's $50 to $60,

00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:18,885
just cost of goods sold.

00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:20,887
So that's not a big ratio
difference. Normally, there is.

00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:23,723
It sounds like your gross margin
structure is not so good.

00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:24,758
Is there a reason why?

00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,626
Because no matter
how much you grow,

00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,829
if your gross margin
out the gate is bad,

00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,630
you're just compounding
the problems.

00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,632
Why are your gross margins
not healthier?

00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:33,834
Yeah, and that's why ‐‐

00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,769
Like, if we could have
a bigger‐size warehouse

00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,571
to order more materials,
we could get that down

00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:39,739
to $20 to $25
instead of $25 to $30.

00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,575
You're talking about
a few dollars.

00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:43,944
Like, $18 of
your cost is shipping.
Right.

00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:46,479
Tell me a little bit
about the back‐end operations.

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,581
How big is the team?

00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:49,950
So, before this year,
it was actually just us two.

00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,018
We boxed every pillow.
We answered all the questions.
We made everything.

00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,787
You guys did all the boxing
in the warehouse?

00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:55,622
Yeah. All of it.
All the boxing
in the warehouse.

00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:57,490
And then
we talked to press.
Okay. And now?

00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,760
And now we hired
two pillow‐builders.

00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,761
[ Chuckles ]
Pillow‐builders.

00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:02,929
Yeah.
And we have someone

00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:05,065
who is full‐time
on customer service.

00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:07,801
I want to share with you
a few things, my thoughts.

00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:09,603
While you're picking
something smart,

00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:12,672
because pillows are great
and everybody needs pillows,

00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,675
it's also an extremely
competitive space,

00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,378
and I just think
the combination of that

00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,680
along with your valuation,

00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,515
it's just not the right
investment for me.

00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:23,884
I'm sorry. I'm out.

00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,919
Thank you very much,
Lori. Yes.
Thank you, Lori.

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,922
Herjavec: Guys, you guys
are super impressive.

00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:31,591
I think Lori makes
a really good point

00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,760
about how competitive
that industry is.

00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,562
Yes, but nobody does
what we're doing,

00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,597
in terms of taking
body stats, sleep positions,

00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:38,632
and preferences
into account.

00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:39,833

$9.99 to $13.99,

from $1.49 to $2.14.

going after online.

the numbers for me.

This year, we're doing
$165,000.

However, there's
a little story to tell.

00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,543
So, I left my job
in July,

00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:39,578
and we started to see this

00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,846
really nice, healthy
uptick in growth.

00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:44,449
Then coronavirus
hit the States,

00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:46,751
and we saw
a slow decrease.

00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,520
Then the countries
that I supply from

00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,788
were also hit
by coronavirus,

00:34:49,788 --> 00:34:51,890
so we didn't have
any inventory.

00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:53,792
And are you in
the company, too?

00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:56,661
No, so, I help
keep the lights on.

00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:58,597
I have a full‐time job.
I'm in technology.

00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,532
I've been 22 years
in technology.

You're a couple?

00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:03,568
Yeah, we're
husband and wife.

You know, providing
financially for the family.

00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:06,538
I'm working full‐time,

00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:08,540
and we have three kids,
which is a lot.

00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:11,776
So I do everything I can
when I get home or off work,

00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,945

'cause she works tirelessly.

00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,681

equity into this business,

00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:18,583
I can't even
measure it.

00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:19,651
How did you
come up with this?

00:35:19,651 --> 00:35:20,552
Why I started
the company?

00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:21,753
I have three boys,

00:35:21,753 --> 00:35:23,922
and getting ready
in the mornings was crazy.

00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:25,790
I was tying
three pairs of shoes,

00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,692
and I was
thinking to myself,

00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:29,794
"What are they walking
through at school

00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,630
that I'm touching these
every morning?"

00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,931
And it just kind of
ruined my day.
Ew.

00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:35,867
I went to the market
to see what was available,

00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:37,969
and I have a 20‐year
background in e‐commerce.

00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,739
I kind of know
the lay of the land,
in terms of product.

00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:42,540
And so when I looked
at the market,

00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,676
I found product
with locks or clips,

00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:45,844
and I have three kids.

00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:47,512
They're gonna be rough
and they're gonna break them

00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:48,580
and they're gonna
lose the clips,

00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,714
and it's gonna be a mess.

00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:52,717
So there were no
stretchy laces that tied in...

00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:54,486
No. There weren't.
Nope.

00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:55,654
Herjavec: How long ago
was that, Jamie?

00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:57,622
That was three years,
a little over three years ago.

00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:59,157
And just last July,

00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:02,861
I left working for
another company to pursue this.
Good for you.

00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:04,763
What was your job
at the other company?

00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:07,499
I was managing
an Amazon business

00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:08,933
that was about
$35 million in revenue

00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:11,670
in the health and beauty
category for that company.

00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,805
You've managed
a $35 million brand

00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:16,541
and then said, "Hey,
I can take those skills

00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:17,876
to do it for myself."

00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:20,679
So now what I'd like to see is,
how have you applied that?

00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:21,813
Because the numbers,

00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:24,482
for a person that has
20 years of experience

00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:26,618

00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:28,687

00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:30,522
When we first launched
the business,

00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:31,656
I was working full‐time.

00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:33,725
So I have been doing this
on nights and weekends,

00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:37,429
and really,
I really just left my job,

00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:38,730
working full‐time, in July.

00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:41,099
I would say something
that I think I'm super proud of

00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:45,937
is the fact that we got on to
the largest e‐tailer, Amazon,

00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:49,541
and we're able to take
a significant market share

00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:50,675
from those other brands

00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:52,944
that have been around
a lot longer than we have.

00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:56,715
I think I did better in terms
of becoming an expert

00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:59,651
on how to grow this business
on that platform.

00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:00,819
When I developed
this product,

00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:02,821
we researched what was
going on on Amazon

00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:05,857
in terms of the search, the
keyword volume, the relevancy.

00:37:05,857 --> 00:37:07,726

"stretch lace,"

for laces, stretch, elastic,
