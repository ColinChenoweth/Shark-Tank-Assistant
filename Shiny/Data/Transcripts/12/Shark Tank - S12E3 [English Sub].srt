how this came to be.

00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,689
So a few years ago,
I heard about weighted blankets,

00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,024
like the rest of
the world.

00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,793
I ended up buying
one of these weighted blankets,

00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,628
and I tried it on,
and I loved it.

00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:57,531
That initial pressure really
brought on this sense of calm.

00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:59,866
But I went to sleep later
that night, and very quickly,

00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:02,202
I ran into the all‐too‐common
list of complaints

00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:03,937
associated with
weighted blankets.

00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:06,606
1, they trap heat like crazy
and they just overheat.

00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,408
Next, they're very
difficult to wash.

00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,577
You can't just take
a 30‐pound weighted blanket

00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:12,078
and throw it
in your washing machine.

00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:13,780
Washing machine would
probably explode, right?

00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,382
I'm a mechanical engineer
who's been able to work

00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:16,917
at some pretty
cool companies,

00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:20,187
so I'm no stranger to creating
solutions to problems.

00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:23,657
Like, okay, maybe you don't use
weight to create pressure,

00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,058
but you use compression.

00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,394

around your entire body

what's your background?

more than a lot of people,

00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,278
how important sleep is ‐‐

00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:46,813
not just for our
physical health,

00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,749
but our mental health, too,
so when he told me this idea,

00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,752
I was already aware of
deep touch pressure therapy,

00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:56,022
not only for things like
autism, which is what it
was originally designed for,

00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,791
but for anxiety disorders,

00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,759
for post‐traumatic stress
disorders.

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,662
Deep touch pressure therapy
is basically gentle

00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:07,601
but firm pressure
applied to the body

00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:10,904
Okay, the question is here ‐‐
how much time and energy

00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:14,040
do you have to spend explaining
the merits of the product

00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,275
to acquire the customer?

00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:17,677
So our cost of acquisition
has been phenomenal.

00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:20,080
What is it?
$11.50 blended.

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,215
Wow.
And that's over
the last six months.

00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,683
Very good.
And this is scalable.

00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:25,552

What'd you do last month?
What did you do last month?

00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,560
So last month was
our highest revenue month ever.

00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,794
We did 50,000
last month.

And were you profitable?
Oh, absolutely.

00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,032
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, so how much
did you make in profits?

00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:42,636
So our net profit is usually
about 41% of our top line sales,

00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:44,738
so it was
about 22,000.
Good for you.

00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:45,972

Yeah. Thank you.

with $2,500.
Yeah, baby!

00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:54,047
That's all you've put in?
That is all we put in,
and we were profitable

00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:56,249
within the first
week or two of selling.

00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,485

00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,756
you'll notice it starts
to swim on its very own,

00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:27,593
mimicking the swim patterns
of real fish.
Oh, wow!

00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,096
Wow.
If <i>you</i> think it swims
like a real fish,

00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,697
what are the fish
going to think?

00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,733
So, why?
[ Chuckling ] Why?

00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:37,537
Why spend so much time
and money on traditional lures

00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:39,372
and live bait, when
you can use...

00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:41,474
Both: Animated Lure?

00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:44,310
See how much you can learn
on "Shark Tank?" It's amazing.
Herjavec:
It's amazing, Kevin!

00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,745
John: Amazing!
Greiner: You know,

00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:47,246
I have to ask
Daymond, though ‐‐
O'Leary: Who knew?

00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,982
Is this different than anything
you've ever used to fish with?

00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:51,984
John:
Yeah, I've never seen it.

00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:53,419
How often does it rust?

00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,754
Or, you know,
like, how many times

00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:56,222
do you need to
re‐buy that unit?
Sanaee: Yeah, yeah.

00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:58,524
So, right now we have
about 40 times.

00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:01,027
This is with action,
with you catching fish

00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:02,128
and stuff like that.

00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,263
So how long does it
hold a charge for?

00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,032
So, for different sizes.

00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:08,034
For the minis,
up to 45 minutes of swim.

00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:09,836
For the classic is
an hour and a half.

00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:11,604
For the biggest one you see,
the Salt Water,

00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:13,206
the one that's in
production right now,

00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:14,874
that's up to
two hours.

00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:17,610
What makes you guys
fish experts?

00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,713
Why should I believe you?

00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:24,517
I'm a project manager at
manufacturing facilities and...

00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,719
And I'm actually a licensed
professional counselor.

00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,088
I'm working in community mental
health in Collin County.

00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,523
Well, then,
it makes sense.

00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:34,260
[ Chuckles ]
No, no, but it's something
that we saw growing up.

00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:38,598
And if I may, my dad and I
used to go fishing all the time,

00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:41,100
and I don't share
about my dad too often,

00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,435
so please bear with me.

00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:44,003
Him and I used to go fishing
all the time,

00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,139
all the way until he was
diagnosed with a lung disease

00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,741
and concluded
his human experience.

00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,443
But it was during those times
where we noticed

00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:52,111
some of the problems
that exist

00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:54,046
with the old, traditional
fishing method.

00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,048
And so
they have always taught us

00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,451
to not only
identify problems,

00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:00,853
but to try your best
to be part of the solution.

00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,355
And so these words
meant a lot to me

00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,290
because it came
from two individuals

00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:07,393
that sacrificed everything
to come to this country

00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:09,462
so that their children have
an opportunity

00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:12,031
to contribute to
the betterment of society.

00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,133
Also, to take control
of their own destiny.

00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,468
Where did you come from?

00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:17,503
Iran. Iran.
From Persia. Yeah.
Iran.

00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,805
What do these cost you to make?
What do you sell them for?

00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,040
And tell us about
your total sales.

00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,476
Perfect. The landing price
for the Mini is $8.

00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:25,545
For the classic,
it's $10.

00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,014
And what does the
new big one cost?
$16.

00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:30,449
For the Mini,
it's retailing at $29.95.

00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,318
For a Classic,
$32.95.

00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:34,954
And for our Salt Water,
it's $79.95.
Greiner: Wow!

00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:38,391
Is it all direct or
are you through retail?
There's a huge
margin on the Salt.

00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,060
Right now, it's majority
on our website.

00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,828
However, we are
in a few mom‐and‐pop stores

00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:43,896
here in the United States.

00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,431
We also have
a distributor in Canada.

00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:46,699
We're in about
40 stores there.

00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:50,236
What about the big boys?
Bass and all the rest?

00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:53,773
That's where we're hoping to
make a deal, and we don't know.
Ohhh!

00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:56,309
They'll pick up
<i>your</i> phone calls, for sure.

00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:58,177
Okay, but while we're still
talking dollars...

00:17:58,177 --> 00:17:59,178
Sure.
Yes.

00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,613
...and costs.

00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:05,585
$325,000, 10% imputes
a $3.25 million value.

00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:09,121
You must be selling
a lot of mechanical fish.

00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:11,958
2020 to date,
we're at $247,000.

00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,926
Good for you.
We're projecting
for this year

00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,661
half a million dollars in sales,
and then, even next year,

00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,730
$675,000 in sales.

00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,699
You guys are
making money right now?

00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:23,769
So, yes. So right now, me and
Sobhan both work full‐time jobs.

00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,404
We have zero debt
in this company.

00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,573
Good.
We've put everything, our own
money, into this company.

00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:30,409
How much did you put in?
$125,000 to get
the ball rolling

00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,311
so we could
get this done.
You didn't mess around,
did you?

00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:35,448
No, no, no, we haven't taken a
penny out of our own company.
Yeah.

00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:38,684
Every cent we've earned,
we put back into our company.
John: Do you own the company?

00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:40,586
Herjavec:
As you should.
Yes. Equally.
Yes, sir.

00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:43,389
I'm thinking the way to sell
this is, forget about fishing.

00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:45,658
Put 10 of them in a tank
and call it an aquarium.

00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,226
You don't have to feed it.
Cuban: Yeah. You know what?

00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:50,396
At, like, a restaurant or
something like that.
[ Laughter ]

00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:53,399
That is
a good idea!
Greiner:
And it never dies!

00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:54,734
That's a great idea.

00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,535
Cuban: Hey, guys, look,
it really is a good idea.

00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,704
It really is clever.
But I'm just not a fisherman.

00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,539
I just don't have
that feel for it.

00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,342
And so, while I'm proud
of what you've accomplished...
Appreciate you.

00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,578
...I have to say
I'm out.
That's fine.
No worries. Thank you.

00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:07,446
Listen, I am not
a fisherman, either.

00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:08,748
I just know a little bit.

00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:10,950
And for those reasons,
'cause I don't know,

00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,451
It's a little too early
for me.

00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:13,519
I'm out.

00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,188
Guys, you're not
really a company.

00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:18,090
You're basically
a product right now

00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,992
because both of you
have real jobs.

00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,594
And that's nothing
wrong with that.

00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:25,031
How do I get my $325,000
back again?

00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:27,533
The reality of the situation is,
it's not about what you know ‐‐

00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,302
it's about who you know,
and we know that you know

00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:32,004
that you guys know
a lot of people.

00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,439
But think about what
you're saying.

00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:34,974
I give you $325,000,

00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:38,110
then I go to work for you,
opening up big box retail.

00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,146
I get on the phone,
I fly to meet the buyer

00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:42,782
or whatever I have to do,
and I'm working so you,

00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:46,118
who have 90% of the company,
can say, "Good dog. Good dog."

00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,887
And I gave you all the money.

00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:50,423
Either I'm going to get a
huge percentage of this company

00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:53,025
'cause it's not even worth
$325,000 yet,

00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,494
or you're gonna come up
with some very creative way

00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:59,765
that I get my capital back while
my partners own 90%.

00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:02,635
You know,
that's the problem.
That's a royalty deal
he's looking for.

00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:04,003
Did you say
"royalty deal," Lori?
Oh. Hark.

00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:05,471
[ Laughs ]
Oh, my goodness.

00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:06,505
Oh, my goodness.

00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,774
So, here's what I suggest ‐‐

00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:10,309
I give you the 325,000,

00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:13,679
I get $3 a unit until
I recoup a million bucks.

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,615
10% of the company in case
somebody decides to buy it.

00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:18,718
That is a
great offer.
Of course it is.

00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,019
Let me just tell you
where I stand.

00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:21,554
There's something you said
that really bothered me.

00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,456
You said, "It's not
what you know.

00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:24,824
It's who you know."

00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:28,127
When I started out,
everyone said that to me.

00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:30,362
"You're never going to make it.
You don't know anybody."

00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:33,632
I was screwed before I started
if I believed that.

00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,267
It's not who you know.

00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,837
It's what you make
with what you have.

00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:40,172
That's fair.
I respect
the dream

00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,808
and I really respect
the hustle you guys have...

00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,610
I appreciate it.
...but this isn't
a business for me.

00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,847
I think you've got
a long way to go. I'm out.

00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:49,014
I appreciate it.
Thank you.

00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,884
John: Alright. The product ‐‐
superb, amazing.

00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:54,720
Where I'm struggling is,
of course, the valuation.

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,757
If I gave you
325 for 10%,

00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,892
basically,
as you drill down the numbers,

00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:04,797
paying yourself and, you know ‐‐
on a 40%, even 50% margin,

00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:08,367
you would have to do
almost $35 million

00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:11,437
to then take distribution
for me to make my money.

00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,038
You came here to fish
for a Shark,

00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:14,173
but you didn't hook
this one.

00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:15,508
I'm out.

00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:16,809
Yeah.

00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:18,711
Well, then...

00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:21,347
all roads lead back
to Mr. Wonderful...

00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:22,448
and the fish.

00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:23,783
What are you
gonna do?

00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:27,453
So, our counter would be
20% for half a million dollars.

00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,655
Cuban: Hello!
Okay, hold on.

00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:32,892
And how many dollars
a unit in royalty?

00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:35,528
So in this counter,
no royalty.

00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:36,595
[ Laughter ]

00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:39,231
Ohh! Don't you know
who he is?

00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,967
I thought we were on
the planet Earth together.

00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,169
Let me absorb the counter

00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:44,937
so I can just
get the essence of it.

00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:46,305
[ French accent ]
The essence.

00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,974
[ Normal voice ] Instead of me
giving you 325 for 10%,

00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:52,011
I give you half a million
for 20%,

00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:53,412
and I may never see it again.

00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:56,315
It may swim away 'cause we don't
know what's gonna happen.

00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,083
We want some guidance.
We're young.

00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,285
We're still learning
the ropes.

00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:00,586
The first guidance is ‐‐

00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:02,755
listen when you have
a real investor on the hook

00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:04,723
and don't come back
with a stupid counter.
I have a question.

00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:05,958
Do you want him?
That's
a ridiculous counter.

00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,293
Look, look,
I can't take it.

00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:09,061
