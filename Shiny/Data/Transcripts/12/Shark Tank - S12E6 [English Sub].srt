How did you get into

So, my father was
born and raised

in a small fishing village
in Malaysia.

00:03:02,576 --> 00:03:05,112
Luckily, I had the opportunity
to go visit family

to learn about my heritage
and where I came from.

And one of these
visits to Malaysia,

there was a bowl of food
on the table.

00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:11,852
I reached in and try it,

00:03:11,852 --> 00:03:14,355
and immediately, I thought,
"Oh, this is great.

00:03:14,355 --> 00:03:16,223
It must be pork."
I was really confused.

00:03:16,223 --> 00:03:17,892
The person who served it
was my cousin,

00:03:17,892 --> 00:03:19,660

00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,463
and he had been making the snack
for himself, for his family,

00:03:22,463 --> 00:03:25,766
for people in the area
and selling it locally.

00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:28,102
And as vegetarians,
they had a really hard time

00:03:28,102 --> 00:03:29,370
finding foods
that not only tasted great,

00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,539
but also had
a really great texture.

00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:33,474

very satisfying

It's, "Let's get people who are
into this lifestyle excited."

00:28:33,806 --> 00:28:36,075
You're selling
on the improvement

00:28:36,075 --> 00:28:37,777
that you find in your life.

00:28:37,777 --> 00:28:39,745
That's
your value proposition.

00:28:39,745 --> 00:28:41,747
You know, that's where
the real value comes,

00:28:41,747 --> 00:28:43,716
and this just happens
to be the delivery mechanism

00:28:43,716 --> 00:28:44,884
that you've chosen.

00:28:44,884 --> 00:28:46,686
The question becomes,
is this the right vehicle?

00:28:46,686 --> 00:28:49,722
And at $30 every two weeks,
or $15,

00:28:49,722 --> 00:28:51,457
that's gonna be
a challenge for me.

00:28:51,457 --> 00:28:53,059
And so for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,629
The beverage industry

00:28:56,629 --> 00:29:00,066
is probably the most
difficult industry on Earth

00:29:00,066 --> 00:29:01,701
to gain share in.

00:29:01,701 --> 00:29:03,236
Om!

00:29:03,236 --> 00:29:04,704
Let's talk with that
for a moment.

00:29:04,704 --> 00:29:06,672
We embrace the fact
that it's hard.

00:29:06,672 --> 00:29:08,341
Yeah.
But wait. It gets better.

00:29:08,341 --> 00:29:10,843
Never in the history

of Genghis Khan,

a subscription model to work.

try and do that.

"om" on the first problem,

breaking into
an impossible sector.

00:29:26,525 --> 00:29:30,329

that's never been done before.

because I'm not sure that people

their drinks.

subscription models,

a concentrated form ‐‐

of other vitamins,

that you could concentrate this

Yes.

00:36:15,334 --> 00:36:17,870

12 months ago.

00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:20,939
We are currently
over $300,000 in sales,

00:36:20,939 --> 00:36:24,877
and we're selling
food service, retail,

00:36:24,877 --> 00:36:26,412
both in stores
and e‐commerce.

00:36:26,412 --> 00:36:27,646
And how are you selling?

00:36:27,646 --> 00:36:29,748
Are you advertising
or are you going door to door?

00:36:29,748 --> 00:36:31,350
Distributors are
most of your sales?

00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:32,818
Let me tell you
the story.

00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:35,254
So, we basically
loaded the back of our cars,

00:36:35,254 --> 00:36:39,525
and I went out driving
every day to restaurants,

00:36:39,525 --> 00:36:40,859
to stores,
basically...

00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:42,528
Hustle, hustle, hustle.
...selling the product.

00:36:42,528 --> 00:36:43,662
I like it.
Mycoskie: Wow.

00:36:43,662 --> 00:36:44,797
And then, also, I noticed

00:36:44,797 --> 00:36:46,665
you've said the word
"sustainable" several times,

00:36:46,665 --> 00:36:49,101
and it's at the very top
of your packaging here.

00:36:49,101 --> 00:36:51,670
So what is your mission
with the company?

00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,672
I don't think you can do
anything, really,

00:36:53,672 --> 00:36:56,809
without doing some good,
as well.

00:36:56,809 --> 00:36:57,876
I agree.

00:36:57,876 --> 00:36:59,411
So the fact
that it's natural

00:36:59,411 --> 00:37:02,114
and it's made from sawdust
is actually cleaning waste.

00:37:02,114 --> 00:37:04,349
There's another element
to the company.

00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:06,919
That is, you buy one,
we plant one.

00:37:06,919 --> 00:37:09,388
Mm.
So we've partnered up
with this amazing organization

00:37:09,388 --> 00:37:11,090
called One Tree Planted.
Cool.

00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:13,525
And for every pack,
whether it's the 9‐pound

00:37:13,525 --> 00:37:15,994
or the 22‐pound,
we plant a tree.

00:37:15,994 --> 00:37:17,930
And what does that
cost you to do that?

00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:19,298
$1 per tree.
$1.
