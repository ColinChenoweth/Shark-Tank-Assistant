00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:25,751
in my childhood home
of Alaska.

00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:28,888
It was a snowy paradise
and an amazing experience,

00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:31,023
except for the equipment.

00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:34,326
Everything about traditional
equipment is inconvenient.

00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:37,963
It's bulky, it's hard to learn,
and it's dangerous.

00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:41,033
ODR skis are sleek
and hassle‐free,

00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:43,569
easy to transport,
and a total thrill.

00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:44,837
Check it out.

00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:46,138
With ODR skis,

00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,541
you get the rush of wind
blowing through your hair

00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,609
without the risk
of out‐of‐control riding

00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:52,211
or runaway speed,

00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:54,647
and without bindings
or leverage points,

00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:58,184
the common injuries that you see
in skiing and in snowboarding

00:21:58,184 --> 00:22:00,119
are virtually eliminated.

00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:03,022
What you're witnessing, Sharks,
is the inception of a sport

00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:06,392
and a brand that is disrupting
the global ski industry.

00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:12,198
So, we're seeking $350,000
for a 10% stake in ODR.

00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:13,766
So, who's ready to join me?

00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:16,335
'Cause it's all downhill
from here.

00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,803
[ Laughs ]
Greiner: That's very cool.

00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:19,805
Very cool.
Are there other ‐‐

00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,640
anything else
out there like this?

00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,343
So, we have started
to get some competition,

00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,145
but what's unique about us

00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:28,280
is that we're
a fully integrated system.

00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,815
So despite looking
like ski boots,

00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:32,318
they're actually flexible,
like a tennis shoe.

00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:34,520
And then, lastly, this is really
our bread and butter.

00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,888
We're the only one
in the industry

00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:38,724
using a system called
liquid steel injection molding,

00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:41,126
and what this gives the rider
is great edge control

00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:43,696
on harder‐packed
groomed snow conditions.

00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,164
Kevin, how long have you
been doing this?

00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:47,499
I've been doing this
since 2017.

00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:49,869
You started selling
in 2017 or...

00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:53,272
In 2017, the company had been
around already for one year,

00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:55,341
so they started in 2016.

00:22:55,341 --> 00:22:56,675
And I'm sorry ‐‐
I think I missed something.

00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:59,445
You said somebody else
was doing this initially?

00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:02,948
Yes, so, I joined the company
in 2017 as a distributor,

00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:05,251
and little did I know
that in a few short years,

00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:07,620
I'd end up owning
the global brand.

00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,288
So, obviously
there was a founder.

00:23:09,288 --> 00:23:10,456
Tell us about
that journey.

00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:12,358
Yes. I've always wanted
to be a disrupter.

00:23:12,358 --> 00:23:13,859
I've always wanted to work
on technologies

00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:15,361
that are
creating new opportunities.

00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:17,196
So I saw a video
for this product,

00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:18,530
and I was like,
"Oh, my goodness.

00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,366
I have to figure out
how to be a part of this."

00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:22,735
So I put in $100,000
to own the distribution rights

00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,069
in North America

00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,472
and then just built the company
and got so powerful here

00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:28,741
and so big with the sales
that were being generated.

00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,410
So, how did you get
all the equity into your name?

00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,412
Yes. Sales, Kevin.
That's how I got it.

00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,382
I got the equity
because I was a sales monster.

00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:37,483
I was eating market share.

00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:38,951
Say that again,
'cause I love to hear it.

00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:40,686
[ Laughs ]
"I am a sales monster."

00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:42,521
...a sales monster!

00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:46,292
I built myself so big that I
overwhelmed their supply chain,

00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:48,027
and they had to
make a choice.

00:23:48,027 --> 00:23:50,763
The choice was
I take over the company

00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:53,399
and they come with me on a ride
to the next winter sport

00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:54,934
or I end up as a competitor.

00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,302
Whoa!
Corcoran: Hardball!

00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:57,536
Ba‐bam!

00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:59,872
What percentage do you
own of the company now?

00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:02,041
I own the entire company
worldwide now.

00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:03,642
What did you pay
for the company?

00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:06,412
So, my invested capital
was originally $100,000.

00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:08,948
I ended up putting
in another $50,000,

00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,282
and then I took on investment

00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,418
to clear the buyout
of the entire company,

00:24:12,418 --> 00:24:15,955
and that total transaction cost
another $200,000 on top of that.

00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:19,725
Was this company originally
an international company?

00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:20,793
Yes, ma'am.

00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,695
Can you tell us
where that was?
Norway.

00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:25,064
They were operating around
the world in over 20 countries.

00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:28,767
And the problem with the model
is, I believed from day 1,

00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:31,036
the key to the future
for winter sports

00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:32,504
was a direct‐to‐consumer
model,

00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:34,873
a product that was
easier to size, easier to fit,

00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:37,643
and so I focused
on digital.

00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,278
I'm a skier, okay?
Yes.

00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:40,779
What makes this
any different

00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:43,315
than the shorty that I have
already with a binding on it?

00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,550
Sure.

00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,386
And the challenge for shorties,
they're very unstable.

00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:48,520
It's not easy to do

00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,823
'cause you don't have
a lot of base on the snow.

00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:53,058
So, we have riders that have
gone over 60 miles an hour

00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:54,760
on the product
you see in front of you.

00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,528
Just 'cause you <i>can</i>
doesn't mean you <i>should.</i>

00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:58,430
You can achieve great speed.

00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:02,501
One thing that's been very
near and dear to my heart is,

00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,236
we haven't had
a serious reported injury

00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:05,571
in the growth
that we've had,

00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:07,039
which has been
really tremendous.

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,575
It comes down to
the fact that when you fall,

00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:11,310
you fall naturally.

00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,878
There's nothing
binding you up.

00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:15,614
Like, I've always heard
it's the bindings.
Yes.

00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:17,916
I decided not to become a skier
for that same reason.

00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:20,519
However, I did become
a pretty good snowboarder.

00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,755
I'm called Chocolate Powder
on the mountain.

00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:24,323
Can you go in deep powder
with these?

00:25:24,323 --> 00:25:27,393
So, they <i>can</i> work in fresh snow,
a few inches of fresh snow.

00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:29,862
How can they be in deep snow?
There's no base.

00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:30,896
That would be impossible,
Kevin.

00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:32,931
Not deep powder.
Not, like, off trail.

00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:34,233
And not that
that's that important,

00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:35,901
'cause that's probably about,
what, 3% of riders?

00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:38,370
I mean, the rest are on
regular slopes.
Correct.

00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,906
What is the retail price on this
and your cost to make it?

00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:43,409
So, it's $100,
our cost to make it,

00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:46,645
and then we sell it
for an average ticket of $350.

00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:49,882
And what is a typical ski boot?
Roughly $350 to $400, right?

00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:52,284
Yes, ma'am,
and for an entire ski set,

00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:54,586
it can be considerably
more than that.

00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:55,854
What are your sales?

00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:59,024
2016, $238,000 in sales.

00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:00,292
I had yet to join
the company.

00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:03,362
2017, I got involved halfway
through the season.

00:26:03,362 --> 00:26:06,298
We did $660,000.

00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:08,367
And you're crediting yourself
for that?

00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:09,568
[ Chuckles ] Of course.

00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:10,869
He's a sales monster.

00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:13,739
2018, $977,000.

00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:15,207
Okay,
what's the next year?

00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:18,343
We're on track, conservatively,
to $1.5 million this season.

00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:21,180
Are you gonna make any money
off the $1.5 million this year?

00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,650
This year, we're going to be
approaching our profitability,

00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:27,319
and that's because of
the direct‐to‐consumer
digital pivot.

00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,921
You've never had
a profit to date?

00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:32,524
We <i>have,</i> actually.
In 2018, we did $120,000.

00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:35,461
The restriction has been
wholesale to distributors

00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:37,729
around the world
with opportunity everywhere

00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:40,132
versus me ‐‐ digital, digital,
digital, digital.

00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:42,101
John:
Kev, I got one last question ‐‐
I just want to make sure

00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,936
that I'm understanding
the story.
Sure.

00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:46,138
A poor little guy in Norway
comes up with this great idea,

00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:47,840
and then you come in,
and then you threaten

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,409
to take over the company
or become a competitor.

00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:51,410
Yes.

00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,778
If I become
a partner with you,

00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:54,847
would you stab me in the back
the same way?

00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:56,248
No. Not at all.

00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:57,850
So, Daymond,
this is what happened.

00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:01,053
I built just a really
tight‐knit family

00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:02,688
of customers here in the US.

00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:04,056
I was getting to meet them,
see them,

00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:05,958
see how it was
affecting their life.

00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,026
I was getting letters,
and they're saying, like,

00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:09,528
"I got to see
my kid out there."

00:27:09,528 --> 00:27:12,097
"I had a bad injury. Now I get
to be with him on the slopes."

00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:13,732
And so it was
super powerful.

00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:16,034
And what happened was,
when my supply chain

00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:19,004
got just restricted,
they started to manipulate me.

00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:20,506
They started say,
"If you want it now,

00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:21,940
it's gonna be this price."

00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,710
And I'd built this
really amazing following
and family here.

00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,845
And so finally, we reached
just this breaking point,

00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:28,080
and that's when it came up,
Daymond,

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,848
where I said,
"I cannot abandon the people

00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:31,617
that I've put my blood, sweat,
and tears into

00:27:31,617 --> 00:27:32,784
and my money into.

00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:34,620
We're either gonna
move forward together

00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,955
or, like,
I'm gonna do this on my own."

00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:39,591
Alright, Kevin,
here's my decision.

00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:41,226
I think this product
is impressive.

00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:42,694
I know snowboarding.

00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:44,163
I don't know anything
about skiing.

00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:46,431
I think there's two
other people up here for sure

00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:48,800
that are more skilled
in that area,

00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,569
but I would be doing you
an injustice,

00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:52,104
not bringing
more knowledge to this,

00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:54,072
so for that reason,
I'm out.

00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:55,207
Thank you, Daymond.

00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:57,309
I love you.

00:27:57,309 --> 00:28:00,312
Thank you, Lori.
You are amazing.

00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:04,550
Any other product under the sun,
I'd be so in with you.

00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,652
Problem is,
I'm not a skier.

00:28:06,652 --> 00:28:10,355
And so, unfortunately,
for that reason, I'm out.

00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,423
Okay.

00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:13,325
Yeah, Kevin,
you're the perfect entrepreneur,

00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:14,826
and I've never said that

00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:17,196
the entire history
of being on "Shark Tank."

00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,730
And I mean that seriously.
Thank you, Mark.

00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,065
You love to sell
your product

00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:22,868
because you know
how amazing it is,

00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,870
but you understand
it's not about convincing.

00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,004
It's about helping.

00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,906
The problem is,
I've never skied in my life.

00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:30,309
So while I am just
wowed by you,

00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:31,643
for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:34,913
I'm pretty familiar
with the ski industry,

00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:38,884
and frankly, $1.5 million
in sales for this year

00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:41,386
is a really small amount
in the context

00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:44,356
of the ski equipment industry,
which is in the billions.

00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:47,459
It's so intriguing, but I can't
get there as an investor.

00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:49,895
I'm sorry, Kev,
but I'm out.

00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:51,330
Barbara's still in.
What do you want to do, Barb?

00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,531
I'm sitting here
on the fence,

00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:54,199
and I keep going on
one side of the fence

00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:56,435
and getting, "Oh, I'm going
to the other side of the fence."

00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:58,537
I do believe this is
a game changer,

00:28:58,537 --> 00:29:01,039
and I really believe
in your vision for the sport.

00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,542
I also like
your price structure.

00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:05,410
You basically
get into this sport

00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,980
for a third of what it would
cost you to get the skis,

00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,681
the boots, the bindings,
the poles.

00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:11,183
Yes.
To the other side,

00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:12,651
here's what's bothering me.

00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:15,988
When I sold my business,
at the 11th hour,

00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:18,657
one of the most important
people in my business

00:29:18,657 --> 00:29:20,959
held me up
for a million dollars.

00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,794
She said, "You either
pay me a million

00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:25,264
or I'm going
to your rival."

00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:27,633
Now,
what do you think happened?

00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:29,401
I gave her the million
immediately.

00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:31,336
She would have
spoiled the deal.

00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:33,105
The deal would have
been off.

00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:35,274
The idea that you held a gun
to your employer's head ‐‐

00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,042
That's not what happened,
Barbara.
Yes.

00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:38,677
Cuban: Yeah, I don't see that
at all.
It isn't what happened,
Barbara.

00:29:38,677 --> 00:29:40,345
Yes, I read that.
I read it that way.

00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:43,582
I begged them for over a year,
and they wouldn't budge ‐‐

00:29:43,582 --> 00:29:45,050
back and forth
and back and forth

00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:47,352
and more constricted
and more constricted.

00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:49,288
You are
a phenomenal salesman.

00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:51,156
You'd be the top dog
in any industry.

00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:52,024
Thank you.

00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:54,359
But I have to say to you,
um...

00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:56,528
Unh‐unh.
I wouldn't trust you.

00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:59,464
I think I'd be worried
a little bit about my own back.

00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,300
It's as simple as that,
so I'm out.

00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:05,637
Good luck, Kevin.
Thank you so much.
Appreciate it.

00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:06,838
Good luck, Kevin.
Alright.

00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:11,476
Barbara's, I'm sure,
been in many situations

00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,878
like the one she described,

00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:14,846
and those situations
can really scar you.

00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:16,515
All of the Sharks, I believe,

00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:18,483
are gonna regret
not making a deal today,

00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,819
as they watch this company
grow into the future

00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,087
and do amazing things.

00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:24,122
It was <i>his</i> relationships
with the customers,

00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:25,390
not the people in Norway.

00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,626
No, but I'm gonna tell you,
that's not the tone.

00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:30,195
The tone here was "I took over
the company. <i>I</i> did it."
Yes. That's how I felt.

00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:32,230
And I think there was
some bravado.
That's how I felt
during the opening of it.

Hi. I'm Dahlia Rizk
from Windham, New Hampshire,

00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:02,494
and I'm here seeking $100,000

00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:04,830
in exchange
for 10% of my company,

00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,631
Buckle Me Baby Coats.

00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:07,866
Before we get started,

00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,235
I wanted to ask you guys ‐‐
how many of you

00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:13,672
have been personally victimized
by a toddler?

00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:15,140
Yeah.
Kids are exhausting,

00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,476
and getting them
into the car seat safely

00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:20,512
is a battle that gets even worse
in the wintertime.

00:31:20,512 --> 00:31:23,782
You see, most parents still
don't know that both the NHTSA

00:31:23,782 --> 00:31:25,684
and the American Academy
of Pediatrics

00:31:25,684 --> 00:31:28,754
recommend taking puffy coats
off in the car seat.

00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:29,855
The puffiness of the coat

00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:31,723
compresses
underneath the harness,

00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,291
and experts have found

00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:36,061
that the teeniest amount
of extra forward movement

00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:39,030
creates critical brain, neck,
and spine injuries,

00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:42,534
or worse, they can be thrown
from the car seat.

00:31:42,534 --> 00:31:43,902
Like all parents,

00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,772
I totally wanted my daughter
to be strapped in safely.

00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:50,509
But my reality was,
she was freaking out.

00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:53,845
I thought to myself,
"What are my options?"

00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:55,881
I could take her
out of her coat,

00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:57,582
but it is freezing outside.

00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,519
I could leave the coat on,
but it's dangerous.

00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:01,820
I felt like I had to choose

00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:04,589
between safety,
warmth, and convenience,

00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,892
but I wanted all three.

00:32:06,892 --> 00:32:09,928
I thought to myself, "Shouldn't
there be an easier, safer way?"

00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,430
So I invented one.

00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,698
Buckle Me Baby Coats'
patented design

00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:17,335
opens along the shoulder seams
and the side,

00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:20,071
allowing parents
to put the coats on at home,

00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:23,542
put their child in the car seat
the way they normally do,

00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:25,710
pulling the one hand through,

00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,913
then pulling through
the other hand.

00:32:27,913 --> 00:32:30,816
And the difference in the coat
is in this front panel.

00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:32,551
When you pull it
out of the way,

00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:34,753
it allows the harness
to sit directly on

00:32:34,753 --> 00:32:36,188
the chest and shoulders...
Clever.

00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:39,925
...with absolutely
no puffy fabric in the way.

00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:42,727
The back of the coat is thinner
than the front, as well.

00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:44,863
This allows the harness
to be pulled

00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:48,667
to the same exact tightness
as no coat at all.

00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:51,403
I'm sure you've had your share
of battles with your kids.

00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:54,339
Unsafe coats in the car seat
should never be one of them.

00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:57,609
So, Sharks, who will join me
in making kids' winter coats

00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:59,311
exactly what they should be ‐‐

00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:03,648
easy and convenient for parents
and safe and warm for kids?

00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:07,219
Dahlia, how many people know
this is a problem?

00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:09,855
So, every year,
the news will talk about it

00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:12,190
almost incessantly
starting in September.

00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,926
They recommend that parents
take coats off.

00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:16,595
A recent automobile study
found

00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:20,265
that about 65% of parents
continue to leave coats on,

00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:22,133
whether it's because
they don't know

00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:24,069
or because
it's just too inconvenient.

00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:25,237
They really don't
talk about that.

00:33:25,237 --> 00:33:26,505
'Cause until you walked into
the Shark Tank,

00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:27,806
I've never heard
of this problem.

00:33:27,806 --> 00:33:29,007
I never have, either.

00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,475
John:
When was that "Aha" moment

00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:33,111
that you realized
that this was needed right now?

00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:34,513
So, I was
one of those parents

00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:37,916
who just really wanted to do
everything right by my daughter,

00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:39,784
and I was paranoid
about her car seat,

00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:41,786
and car seats are hard
to put in correctly,

00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:44,356
and it's easier now than it was
when my daughter was little.

00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:45,490
She's now 21.

00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,025
She was about 5
when I thought of this.

00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,593
So you've been working
on this 16 years?

00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:50,762
No. I had to
put the brakes on it.

00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:52,464
Why did it take 16 years?

00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:53,798
So, when I first thought
of the coats,

00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:55,500
I called around
to every coat manufacturer

00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,435
that you could think of,
and none of them thought

00:33:57,435 --> 00:34:00,338
that coats and car seats had
anything to do with one another.

00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:02,607
They were simply
just not interested in the idea.

00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:04,075
And Facebook wasn't a thing,

00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:05,544
so I had no way
to reach parents directly.

00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:06,945
Exactly, yeah.

00:34:06,945 --> 00:34:09,381
And I was at the point where
I was starting my master's,

00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,583
and I'm like, "I can either
do this or do that,"

00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:14,052
and the master's seemed like
more of a sure thing.

00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:17,055
And then as my kids grew older
and my marriage ended,

00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,456
I started thinking,
"What are the things

00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:20,492
I'm passionate about
that I've always wanted to do?"

00:34:20,492 --> 00:34:21,593
And around that same time,

00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:23,628
I was walking through
the parking lot,

00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:26,131
and I saw this mother walking,

00:34:26,131 --> 00:34:27,799
and she had
her daughter in this blanket.

00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:29,434
The blanket was dragging
through the slush,

00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:31,403
and she looked miserable
and defeated ‐‐

00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,104
the way I felt
when I first thought of it,

00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:35,807
and I'm like, "I can't believe
that's still not a thing.

00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:37,609
I'm going to make a prototype."

00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:40,211
I threw it on Facebook.
It exploded.

00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:42,814
And then I just scrambled
to learn the rest,

00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:45,483
and it's been a really crazy
journey, but here I am.

00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:46,885
Welcome to
entrepreneur life.

00:34:46,885 --> 00:34:48,853
I know.
It's been really fun.

00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:51,890
So, what does a coat
typically cost a parent,

00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:53,425
and what does it cost you
to make?

00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:56,461
They cost me between
$14 to $15 landed,

00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:59,431
and I sell them from
$59.99 to $129.

00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:01,933
Where are you selling them,
and how much have you sold?

00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,803
I have sold about $700,000
worth of coats

00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:06,438
in the past three years.
Whoa!
Wow!

00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:07,939
$700,000?
Cuban: Over what period
of time?

00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,107
Over the past three years,

00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,943
and $500,000 was just
in this past year alone.

00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,479
I've done all of this from
the ground up all by myself.

00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:16,982
I've had no investors.
I've had no help.

00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:19,184
I've been trying to put as
much money into inventory

00:35:19,184 --> 00:35:21,820
instead of
into hiring people.

00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,088
Where do you sell them?

00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:25,857
75%, I sell online
through my website and Amazon,

00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:28,627
and then the other 25%,
I sell to a big box store.

00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:31,429
What do you envision
your sales are going to
be this current year?

00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:34,265
My sales this year
are a little bit conservative.

00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:37,235
My growth has been about
250% to 350%,

00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:40,038
but around the time when
I was about to place
the order for this year

00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:43,174
was when COVID started
to become more recognizable,

00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:46,277
and I thought to myself ‐‐
if I order what I had planned

00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:49,681
to order, which was about
$1.3 million in inventory...

00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:53,218
Wow.
...and people are stuck at home
and nobody's traveling...

00:35:53,218 --> 00:35:55,887
I'm by myself ‐‐
I don't have any backers,

00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:58,056
I don't have investors ‐‐
and this will put me under.

00:35:58,056 --> 00:35:59,758
So what did you do?
You put the brakes on
because of COVID‐19?

00:35:59,758 --> 00:36:00,925
I didn't put the brakes on.

00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:03,094
I just purchased
more conservatively.

00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:05,563
And long‐term, what do you
envision for your business?

00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:09,300
If I find a coat company
that is as passionate

00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,437
about car seat coats
and keeping the safety aspect ‐‐

00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:14,039
it's not just a gimmick ‐‐
Then you can license it
to them.

00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,974
...I'm open to
selling the company

00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:18,777
and letting it move on
and really reach more parents.

00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:19,978
That's what I'd like to do.

00:36:19,978 --> 00:36:21,413
And do you have
a patent?

00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:22,580
I have a utility patent,

00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,416
but not only is it
a utility patent,

00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:26,818
but it's a foundational patent,
meaning that it is

00:36:26,818 --> 00:36:30,455
the first patent for a coat
designed for the car seat,

00:36:30,455 --> 00:36:32,090
and I also have trademarks.

00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:33,425
Greiner: That's great.

00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:36,294
As an investor, if I ask you
"How do I get my $100,000 back,"

00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:38,396
do I have to wait
till you sell the company?

00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,632
Well, there are several ways
that I could do it, right?

00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:41,833
So I'd really like to start

00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:43,501
looking into
distribution overseas.

00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:46,171
If you're interested in helping
with distribution overseas,

00:36:46,171 --> 00:36:48,540
we could do some sort of
percentage on those sales.

00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,641
Oh!

00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:51,142
Did I hear "royalty"?

00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:52,744
Maybe. [ Laughs ]
Okay.

00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:55,413
So, how much are you spending
on advertising per month?

00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:57,916
I spend about $8,000 to $10,000
on advertising,

00:36:57,916 --> 00:37:00,485
and it costs me,
depending on the platform,

00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:02,954
between $15 to $18
per customer.

00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:05,223
So it's costing you $30
worst case.

00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,592
Yeah.
So your worst case
is 50% margins,

00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,794
and your best case
is 100% margins.
Yep.

00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:12,597
So you're putting
half a million dollars
in the bottom line.
Yes.

00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:14,499
Yeah,
you're investing in assets.
Yes. Yes.

00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,901
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:20,205
You remind me so much of myself
and the road that I went.

00:37:20,205 --> 00:37:21,539
Oh, that's quite
the compliment.

00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:24,342
I knew nothing about how to
create or market my product.

00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:27,879
I had no business background,
but I just figured it out.

00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:30,515
I often have thought back
and ask myself ‐‐

00:37:30,515 --> 00:37:32,951
if I had somebody
buy out my company

00:37:32,951 --> 00:37:35,820
or if I had somebody
give me a loan,

00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,522
what would I have done?

00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:41,226
And I don't think
I'd be where I am today,

00:37:41,226 --> 00:37:44,329
because I think the fact
that I had to play every role

00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:47,899
and learn every facet of running
and driving a business

00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:49,701
made me smarter and better

00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:53,104
and able to get to
where I am today.

00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:56,541
But I don't think
that you need a partner.

00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:59,010
I think you're doing great
on your own.

00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:02,347
And for that reason,
I'm out.

somebody to come in here.

You know,
the best way to get a buy

is to get a license
in between,

00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,965

in the space

all the kids' coats.

00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:06,504
I think that the best thing
would be to do a fusion.

00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:10,408
I'll give you $100,000 for 20%
of the traditional business,

00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:14,078
and it would be
30% of all licenses I bring in.

00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:17,348
So it doesn't disrupt
your core business.

00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:18,583
Then all the other brands

00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:21,352
that are making the kids' coats
for Peppa Pig,

00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:23,688
to license it out to <i>them,</i>

00:40:23,688 --> 00:40:25,323
so then you get to cover
both bases.

00:40:25,323 --> 00:40:27,992
You get to push out a lot of
stuff on somebody else's dollar
