number one is,
"Don't start a business

unless
it's an obsession."
Okay.

it's not an obsession."

Greiner: I'm gonna tell you
how a diamond's made.

00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,288
The way a diamond is made
is you take carbon

00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:11,024
and you put it under intense
heat and pressure in the earth,

00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:12,559
and it crystallizes.

00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:14,260
And then they take that
out of the earth

00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,663
and they facet it
and they cut it

00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,531
and it turns into
a beautiful diamond.

00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:21,668

to help schools shift
to online learning.

00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:24,469
At a time that we can't gather
for funerals,

00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:26,071
we're humbled
to offer communities

00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:29,308
one of the only digital‐first
grieving experiences

00:28:29,308 --> 00:28:32,544
to celebrate someone's life
during these challenging times.

00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,247
Lomac: We took this opportunity
to launch

00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:37,416
the Cousins Maine Lobster
mobile app

00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:39,551
for all of our franchisees
throughout the country.

00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,220
Tselikis: Instead of
event‐driven business,

00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,488
we now take our trucks to
neighborhoods and communities.

00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:45,791
We've had to focus on
opening ourselves

00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:47,192
to new points of distribution ‐‐

00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:49,695
restaurants with takeout
to specialty groceries ‐‐

00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:52,331
and we're also offering pallet
discounts on our product.

00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:54,099
We've pivoted our farm creamery

00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:56,368
into a full‐service
drive‐through farmer's market,

00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:58,637
allowing our community
a safer way to shop

00:28:58,637 --> 00:29:00,572
than in crowded grocery stores.

00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,007
Sean: During
the stay‐at‐home orders,

00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:04,576
our large‐group scavenger and
treasure hunts weren't possible,

00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,211
so we launched the Adventure
Hunt Quarantine Challenge

00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:08,680
to help people have some fun
and stay active at home.

00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,982
Here at Wine &amp; Design,

00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:11,783
we're selling paint kits
and offering virtual classes.

00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:14,253
It's actually helping
our franchisees

00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:15,454
keep their doors open.

00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:17,556
We're helping couples
get married online

00:29:17,556 --> 00:29:20,425
with a directory of services
like videographers, florists,

00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,893
and home‐decoration kits.

00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:23,195
Everyone's stuck at home

00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:25,163
trying to learn
how to cut their own hair.

00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:27,132
We've done eight times
the amount of sales

00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:28,600
that we normally do.

00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,104
But it's about giving back,
so we've hired over 50 barbers,

00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,472
we would give them some income

00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:35,907
in exchange
for social‐media content.

00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:39,111
This pandemic forced me
to close my physical locations,

00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:40,445
so I took my gyms online,

00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,914
and business has been
better than ever.

00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:47,352
Whoo‐hoo!
That's what I'm talking about!

00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:48,820
Krause: In order to stay open,

00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,456
Scrub Daddy has had to change
every aspect of its business,

00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,458
including temperature checks,
wearing masks,

00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,726
and safe distancing.

00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:57,062
The result has been a happy
and safe work force.

00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:59,798
Under the Weather has created
a new health‐care line,

00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,967
including
the brand‐new IntubationPod

00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:04,569
which protects first responders
and medical workers

00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:06,338
from airborne contagions.

00:30:06,338 --> 00:30:09,341
You'll never succeed at business
unless you welcome change.

00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:11,076

You've got to adapt to survive.

the better your chances

00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:19,985
As we emerge from
the pandemic of 2020,

00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,520
there's gonna be two types
of companies ‐‐

00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,555
those that think that
they can do business the same

00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,657
and those that are agile
and adaptive

00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,693
and realize
the world has changed,

00:30:27,693 --> 00:30:30,929
and this is when we step up,
this is when we innovate,

00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:32,364

Like most parents, I'm concerned
about too much screen time,

00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:15,907
but it was so hard to keep my
2‐year‐old daughter entertained

with anything else.

00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:20,278
It's crucial for a child
to be exposed to great content,

00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:23,715
especially content that supports
social and emotional learning.

00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:27,152
Social robots have shown to be
more engaging for children,

00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:29,988
and they avoid all the negatives
of a screen.

00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:32,157
That's why we created Codi,

00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:34,726
a fun and educational
storytelling robot

00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,229

and, let's face it,
incredibly cute.

00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:46,037
Codi's growing library
includes 130 stories

with age‐appropriate

100 classic songs

and even a slow playlist
for calming down or sleep.

I don't get

For example,
in that video,

the boy was being congratulated
for cleaning up.

00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:17,162
How does the child interact
and get a conversation,

00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:18,997
a sociability

00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:22,200
So, the parent would actually
control through the app,

and there will be different
steps for each habit.

to start cleaning up,

00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,772
and whenever

00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:29,841

Costs the customer $99.99

00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:10,849
3 million people
have seen our ads already.

00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:30,802
I went to Stanford
for my undergrad,

00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:33,772
and I joined a top social‐
and mobile‐gaming company

00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:36,808
where I launched products
that reached millions of people,

00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:38,910
and I got my MBA
from Wharton afterwards,

00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,012
and I spent two years
at the Boston Consulting Group,

00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:43,181

refined my business acumen,

I studied international

After graduating from Stanford,
I got into the toy industry,

00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,935
I brought thousands of toys
to market,

00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,470
from concept to shipment.

00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,105
I actually went to high school
with Dayu,

00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,107
and after I graduated
from UC Berkeley,

00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,276
I worked in international
curriculum design

00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:13,144
as well as
education consulting.

00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:14,846
So as I was working with
all those students,

00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,648
I saw there were gaps
in their learning ‐‐

00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:19,150
not just when it came to
English or STEM subjects,

00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,519
but, really, when it came to
social and emotional learning.

00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:24,222
So right after that,
I decided to change careers

00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:26,057
and find where the roots
of those gaps were,

00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:27,392
and I became
a kindergarten teacher

00:35:27,392 --> 00:35:29,194
in Washington, D. C.,
for two years.

right now,

00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:54,052
my twins would absolutely
adore it for two hours.

00:35:54,052 --> 00:35:56,554
I guess what
I'm struggling with is,

00:35:56,554 --> 00:36:00,692
is the audio component
of the content

00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:02,961
enough to continually stimulate
the kids?

00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:05,463
Because, visually,
nothing changes.

00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:06,831
There's been a lot
of research out there

00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:10,001
showing that a social robot,
which is what this is,

00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:13,304
or some kind of, you know,
smart‐toy device,

00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:17,208
is more engaging than even
animation sometimes in a TV.

00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,844
Parents have been telling us,
"This is amazing.

00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,547
My child hasn't used her tablet
last week.

00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:25,016
My child is finally
going to sleep by herself."

00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,652
But you guys know what
your competition is, right?

00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:30,922
Amazon is already working on
Alexa for kids, right?

00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:32,424
And you've seen some of it,
I'm sure.

00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:33,591
That's your competition,

00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:36,027
and that's big companies
competing with you.

00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,996
Now it's just a question
of form factor.

00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:40,765
Form factor is really
your only true differentiation,

00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:43,001
but other people are gonna
come up with "cute"

00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:45,904
the minute they see that this
is having the success it is.

00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:47,338
Now what happens to you?

00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,040
How do you guys
compete with that?

00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,575
I would say
other than a technology,

00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:52,010
we really have
this human touch.

00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:55,013
So every interaction
and every story you're hearing,

00:36:55,013 --> 00:36:58,483
Codi is directly acted
by a professional voice actor.

00:36:58,483 --> 00:37:01,519
We really want Codi or our
products to be in every home.

00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:02,620
So retail is important.

00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,722
So you want to be
in Walmart,

00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:05,323
you want to be Target,
wherever.

00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:07,292
Exactly, and if we don't
make money, that's fine.

00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:09,127
Because if you're gonna sell it
at $99 retail,

00:37:09,127 --> 00:37:10,762
your margins drop
like a rock.

00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:11,996
We already have a road map

00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:14,666
for cost reduction of 10% to 15%
within the next year

00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:16,367
with no changes
to the product.

00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:18,903
Greiner: Listen,
you are brilliant guys.

00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,905
What worries me is
the competition

00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,707
and the cost are brutal.

00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:25,310
I'm sorry. I'm out.

00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,845
Guys, I think you've done
an amazing job

00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:28,680
from a product‐management
perspective.

00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,148
But at the end of the day,

00:37:30,148 --> 00:37:34,119
I just worry that the kids
are gonna get bored

00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:36,488
of the actual
delivery platform ‐‐

00:37:36,488 --> 00:37:38,189
the hardware Codi.

00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:40,325
When you first came out,
I thought it was super cute,

00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:42,060
but I got to tell you
what I thought.

00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,295
I thought that
this was a screen,

00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:46,498
that the screen would change.
‐Oh.

00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:48,600
I worry about
the interactivity

00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:53,571
with all the stimulus that kids
have today with the iPad.

00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:54,839
I'm out.

00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:57,842
You have the right combination
of brain power here

00:37:57,842 --> 00:38:00,044
to pull out a product like this
and make it work,

00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:01,813
but I don't feel
it's ever gonna make money,

00:38:01,813 --> 00:38:04,749
and so for that reason,
I'm out.

00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:07,819
Cuban:
I love your execution.

00:38:07,819 --> 00:38:09,754
I'm still not sold
on the scale,

00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:11,456
and you guys
haven't convinced me.

00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,391
And so for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:18,496
that if you've done something
bad here on Earth,

00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:21,599
you go to Hell and you work in
the toy industry down there.

00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,234
That's what happens.
Oh, it's not that bad.

00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:25,703
It's pretty bad.
It's pretty bad.

00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:29,474
Both Google and Amazon have
product coming in this category.

00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:31,342

00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,148
I'm out.

00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:40,752
So, next year, we're projecting
$16 million in revenue.

00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:43,655
That's the sale
of 240,000 Codis.

00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:46,024
‐But what changes?
‐Why do you project that?

00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:48,059
'Cause that's pretty

00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:51,329

It is an extremely
ambitious goal,

but we're

00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:56,568
But, Chris, how are you
gonna fund that?

00:38:56,568 --> 00:39:00,271
Like, the amount of inventory
and cost to do that...
Sure.

00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:02,140
So, I have
a very good relationship
