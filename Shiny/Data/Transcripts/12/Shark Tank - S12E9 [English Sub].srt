00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:15,722
My background is
I was a salesperson

for Procter &amp; Gamble,
so I'm very familiar,

So I get the freight. I get
how expensive it's going to be.

But I also believe that you have
to go direct to consumer

00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,069

of consumers online

Because once you are hustling
and you're active,

00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,748
you want to walk into
a convenience store or store

00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:44,518
and you want to
grab something then, right?

00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:46,319
You don't want to grab a water
and then grab your mix

00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,954
and then have to do all that.

00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,490

factor is a big thing.
And I get that.

that space...

is hard,

and then trying to be
direct to consumer...

00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,097
Sure.
...is even harder
'cause of shipping costs.

00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:58,632
You've got to be mixed
direct to consumer.

I think it's important
to be on shelf,

00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,807
and I think it's important
to have a mix

00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,275
that people can order online.

00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:09,342

of potassium

relative to
the amount of calories

00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:16,783
is really good.

So, okay.

formulation named Chill Soda.

00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,049
there wasn't
a single word wasted.

00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:38,918
But I'm not willing
to risk $350,000.

00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,854

what I'll do.

00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,490

we're gonna work together,

00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,767

but not for 40%.

to take

00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:13,413

If you don't
bring them in,

you don't get
the $100,000,

the credit line.

00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:31,464
You're going to have to take
a gamble yourself here.

00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,099

that's only fair

00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:35,702
because I'm taking
a huge gamble myself.

00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:39,572
So, I'm not sure
that I want both of them.

00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,541
Oh, you're not sure?
That I want both of them.

00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,042

Yeah, 30%.

You bring
the big fish in,

00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,531
this is just not okay.

00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:01,901
Well, I have some
really good news for you.

00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:06,806
Corcoran: Oh!
[ Chuckles ]

00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:09,575
Whoa!
All33 is here
to save the day,

00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,544
but don't just take it
from me.

00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:14,147
Let's hear what one of our
biggest fans has to say.

00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,383
Hey, Sharks.

00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:19,986
I'm Justin Bieber,
and this is the All33.

00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:21,988
It's the chair
that moves like I do.

00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:23,756
I mean, guys, look at
this perfect posture.

00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,425
Got my chest up,
my shoulders back.

00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,627
I'm ready for anything.

00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:28,961
I mean, have you guys
ever seen a chair

00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:29,996
that can do this?

00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:32,665
I'm doing a full
ab workout right now.

00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:35,802
Alright. Hit me up later.
I'll be back.

00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:37,870
If you got to sit,
this is it.

00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,775
Now, Justin knows
what he's talking about

00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:47,313
because this is our patented
Sit‐In‐Motion Technology.

00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,315
It's like a chair
within a chair,

00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,884
and it rocks,
just like our sales.

00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:54,187
Now, you don't have to have
moves like Justin

00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:55,922
in order for this chair
to work for you,

00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:58,658
because all you have
to do is sit,

00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:01,894
get fit,
and All33 of your vertebrae,

00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,863
well, they're going to
keep moving all day.

00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:06,299
Now, <i>this</i> is a chair.

00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,067
Now, Mr. Wonderful...
Yes.

00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,002
...you're looking particularly
uncomfortable.
I am.

00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:11,804
Would you like to come up
and take a seat...
I would.

00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,005
...and see what
we're talking about?

00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,041
I have a bad back
from a squash injury.

00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,376
Oh, well, then,
let's see what happens.

00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,045
Howenstein:
Make sure you get your behind

00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:20,913
all the way
into the back of the chair.

00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,582
Scooch back there.
Alright.

00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:23,983
And you can probably feel

00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,952
the rocking motion
move back and forth.

00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:27,720
Very interesting.

00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,555
Why is this
making me sit up straight?

00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:30,723
Why does that happen?

00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,626
So, the patents that we have
about this

00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:35,628
are really quite unique.

00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:37,096
Basically,
Dr. Dennis Colonello,

00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:38,564
who invented this,

00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,233
he's been doing this
for a long, long time ‐‐

00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:42,768
he's got 45 years
of treating backs, necks,

00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,136
and everything else ‐‐
he figured out,

00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,438
let's get
your hips moving,

00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:46,873
almost as if ‐‐
what you're experiencing

00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:49,375
is a sensation that's almost
like you're standing,

00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,644
but when you're sitting.

00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:54,280
It is moving all 33 of your
vertebrae while you're sitting,

00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,682
and there's nothing else
in the world that is doing it.

00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,985
I'm very skeptical about
all these claims on chairs

00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:00,553
'cause I've tried
so many,

00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:02,622
and I also have tried different
devices to help my back.

00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:04,657
This thing actually
is working.

00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:06,125
I don't care
about Bieber.

00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,928
I'm going to kick his ass
when my album comes out.
[ Laughs ]

00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:10,830
I don't like
your valuation, though.

00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:11,998
Well, we can
talk about that.

00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:13,799
Yeah.
I would expect
that from you.

00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,302
Tell us, how did you get
into this, and what happened?

00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:18,371
So, I have been a patient
of Dr. Colonello's

00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,706
for about 20 years
and then friend.

00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,842
I'm also a bit
of a serial entrepreneur.

00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:26,112
I got into making products
and getting products sold.

00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:28,614
Along the way, I got into
the back care space.

00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:31,183
When I sat on Dennis' chair,
an early prototype,

00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:33,619
I said, "This is
a whole different ball game."

00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:36,756
But I knew that Dennis was never
going to get this thing going.

00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:38,224
As a friend, I said,
"Let me help you.

00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,092
I'm going to do
a Kickstarter for you."

00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,394
So, we did that.

00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,762
It performed very well.

00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:43,829
What's very well?

00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,464
We did $800,000.

00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,767
That's very well.
That's great.
Did you license it from him?

00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:48,834
Are you
partners with him?
Howenstein: No, no, no.

00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,002
I own a small piece of it.

00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:51,604
How much of the company
do you own?

00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:53,573
I own about 5%.

00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,675
So, a premium chair
in today's market

00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:58,978
sells for roughly $2,000,
a real premium chair.

00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:00,546
What does this sell for?

00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,415
We're selling this for $799.

00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,283
What's your margin?
What's it cost you to make?

00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,852
So, our margin's around 67%.

00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,255
Our cost delivered to a customer
with all that good stuff

00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,756
is about 260 bucks.

00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:14,293
2.5%. $500,000.
$20 million valuation.
Yep.

00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,495
How many chairs are you selling?
How many dollars?

00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,998
So, this year alone, we've sold
about 3.2 million.

00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:20,766
We're on track to hit
five and a half.

00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,202
Okay, and what are you going to
make on five and a half?

00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:26,505
So, we were slightly profitable
in the second quarter,

00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:29,575
and we expect to be the same
in this third quarter.

00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,811
I mean, just help me
because, you know,

00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:35,481
I'm a quick study
in most sectors...
Sure.

00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,016
...office supply, furniture,
or even,

00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:39,719
if you want to call this
high‐end chair design, whatever.

00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:43,856
Maybe it would trade for
11 times pretax cash flow.

00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:45,925
I mean, I'm not saying
it isn't a great chair,

00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:47,526
but it's a chair.
Yeah.

00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:50,696
Why is it worth
$20 million?

00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,665
We are looking at comps
for other companies

00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:54,867
that are out there
in a very similar space

00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:57,103
that are three to four times
revenue.

00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:58,704
We know we're going to
get there.

00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:02,008
We have also talked
to the market. Not my opinion.

00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:04,143
20 million bucks
is a pretty good valuation.

00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,911
So, then why
are you here?
Why am I here?

00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,980
If you talked to so many people
that gave you that valuation,

00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,248
why are you here?

00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:11,217
Because Shark money
is better than other money.

00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:13,319
So, you're charging
us more than...

00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,954
No.
...your sales
because we're Sharks?

00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:16,422
I'm prepared to give you
a discount

00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:18,624
because you guys
are Sharks.
<i>Can</i> you give a discount?

00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:21,093
I am the CEO of the company,
and I'm here to make a deal.

00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:22,762
You're a marketing company,
first and foremost.

00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,497
You've got
your product, right?

00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,799
It's got its angle.
It's got its differentiation.
Sure.

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,434
And that's good,
right?

00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:30,036
I just don't want to be
in the chair business.

00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:31,637
Sure.
You know?
It's just ‐‐

00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,973
Of all the businesses,
big and small,

00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:35,641
not that there's anything wrong
with the chair business,

00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:36,876
but it's just not for me.

00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:38,511
Okay.
So, for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,713
That's fair.
Thank you.

00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:42,248
If you had
come in here today

00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:43,816
and you wanted to
sell me a chair,

00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:45,518
you're the perfect guy.

00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:46,852
But you weren't here
to sell a chair.

00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,654
You here to sell
a business.
Correct.

00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:51,290
And you said you're
a 5% owner?
Correct.

00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,493
I, for some reason,
feel it lacks credibility.

00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:57,096
Okay.
I think that's a good lesson
for other entrepreneurs.

00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:58,831
You can't
send a salesman in.

00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:01,967
Well, with all due respect,
this is my life right now,

00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:04,670
and to ‐‐ it's a bit
of a denigration to call me

00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,905
a simple salesman on this deal.

00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:07,540
Barbara's very good
at pissing everybody off.

00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,642
Well, that's fair,
and you can do that.

00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:11,177
But the fact is,

00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:13,479
that is not
what is happening here.

00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:15,514
I'm here to build a company.

00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,950
We are building a movement
in a category

00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,452
that hasn't been done before.

00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:21,387
We're going up against
the big guys

00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:24,123
that, you know, frankly,
it's a fractured system

00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:25,858
that I look forward to breaking.

00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:28,260
I wish I could believe
that you're building a category,

00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,029
but I don't see that
as a category.

00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:33,999
I see it as a chair
with a new design element.

00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,068
Well ‐‐
It doesn't get me
all excited.

00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,837
So for that reason,
I'm out.

00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:39,939
Thank you.

00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:42,875
Greiner: The problem for me
is whenever somebody comes in

00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,310
and they have
something different

00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:47,246
that can really be good,
but they're just starting...
Yeah.

00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,481
...and they want
to get a Shark,

00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:50,649
I always feel
the smart thing to do

00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:54,386
is to be a lot smarter
about your valuation,

00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:57,623
because if you get somebody
in and alongside with you,

00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:00,926
you could take a one‐off item
like this and blow it up,

00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,129
which is what
I'm good at.
Sure.

00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:06,999
So, if you had had something
that was just more realistic ‐‐

00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:10,970
because I just feel
it's so out of whack.

00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,005
For me,
it just turns me off.

00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:16,342
And for that reason,
unfortunately, I'm out.

00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:17,576
That's fair.

00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:19,078
There is a competitor company

00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:20,880
that just had a
$200 million valuation

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,215
on, you know,
just a little higher sales.

00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:26,185
I actually work
with one of the bigger guys,

00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:27,820
Varidesk.
Sure.

00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,856
And the whole theory
is the desks raise up

00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:35,494
and the chairs that they sell
are a little pole, a chair,

00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:37,296
so you have to
balance yourself.

00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:41,634
Sure.
This would be
a conflict with me.

00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:44,870
So I'm out.

00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,705
I started choking
on the valuation,

00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,307
and I'm still
choking on it.
Okay.

00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,376
I tried the chair,
and it has merit.

00:21:50,376 --> 00:21:52,344
But 500K for 2.5%?

as a firefighter.

And one of the things
I was excited about
being a firefighter

00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,617
was the brotherhood,
the connection.

00:25:51,617 --> 00:25:54,319
Maybe I remembered that
from my time in the military.

00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:56,188
And as a few months
went by,

00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:58,190
I started to notice
that I couldn't connect

00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,125
with the people
in the department.

00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:01,460

to fit in with the crew.

I'm on my way home that day,

Jennifer what happened,

everything out,

is a rock,

that it was not for me.

I did really well in the job,
but something was missing.

So in 2015, I left
my six‐figure corporate job,

and my savings,

But Michael's job,
when he was doing his job right,

it was supporting us because
it was money in, money out.

It was a very capital
intensive business.

his job, we needed to pivot.

how expensive it is

and you know how important it is
to have a receptive market.

00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:17,396
Why did you launch it at all
and why not wait?

00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:20,199
Good question. So we were
actually working in a restaurant

00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,434
while we were building
our business.

00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:25,370

we got furloughed.

Even worse.

00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:31,109
Even worse, I mean, because
now you have to buy inventory.

You have to do marketing.

00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:57,982
So, the trophies
that exist today,

00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:00,218
just sort of that
same antique‐looking ‐‐

00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,020
Yeah, with the guy
with the ‐‐ you know,
standing on top.

00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,255
Exactly. Everyone was kind of
selling the same thing,

00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:05,590
so when we came
onto the scene,

00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,826
we were the first company
where we had the ability

00:37:07,826 --> 00:37:09,728
for someone to change the colors
on the fly,

00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,429
change the side
on the fly.
John: That does look cool,
I will say.

00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:14,899
Did you design it?
We design everything.

00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,768
So, what are
your backgrounds?

00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:19,204
Professor of mine
gave me invaluable advice.

00:37:19,204 --> 00:37:20,538
He said, "Matt,
if you want to be

00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:22,240
a really successful
entrepreneur,

00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,576
you need to get into
supply chain and logistics

00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,644
to really figure out
how businesses operate

00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:28,646
and how they function
and execute."

00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:30,115
So, first job
out of college,

00:37:30,115 --> 00:37:32,250
I took a job
at a freight brokerage.

00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,519
I rose to the top
of the company in two years.

00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:36,721
Wow.
I was the number one
salesperson in the company.

00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:38,356
Cuban: It brings up
a good lesson for people.

00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:40,458
Whatever you're doing,
be the best at it.

00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:43,194
Be the best at it, yeah.
Because once you're the best
at something,

00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:44,729
every door opens up

00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:47,866
and then you learn where
you can be a great entrepreneur.

00:37:47,866 --> 00:37:50,735
So, good for you for focusing
on being great at what you did.

00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:52,003
Absolutely.

00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:54,506
My background is completely
the opposite.

00:37:54,506 --> 00:37:58,910
I come from TV and film
doing entertainment news, "TMZ."

00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,446
How much did you invest in
this business to get it going?

00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:04,149
We invested $250,000.

00:38:04,149 --> 00:38:06,050
Whoa.
Wow.
That's a lot of money.

00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,353
Why do you have to invest that
much to get this going?
That's not messing around.

00:38:08,353 --> 00:38:09,521
What is it
you spent your money on?

00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:12,056
Walsh: So, in the beginning,
we started small.

00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:15,460
Initially, it was
a $60,000 injection,

00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,095
and in the first three weeks

00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:19,731
of getting into the fantasy
football draft season,

00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:20,965
sold out of everything.

00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,001
What's the average cost?
The average price

00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:25,303
is about $150, $160.

00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,538
What does it cost you
to make it?

00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:28,873
Our average profit margin
is 80%.

00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:30,275
80%?
Wow.
Wow.
Dang.

00:38:30,275 --> 00:38:34,012
Can you walk through the revenue
growth first year,

00:38:34,012 --> 00:38:35,747
what you sold,
what you made?

00:38:35,747 --> 00:38:39,717
So, Year 1,
January 2018,

00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:42,987
we did $850,000
of revenue.

00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,255
Amazing.
Your first year?
Wow.

00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:46,658
What did you make?
What did you make on the 850?

00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:49,761
The first year, we had
about a $200,000 net

00:38:49,761 --> 00:38:51,529
that we just rolled right into
inventory for Year 2.

00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:53,264
Okay.
And then next year ‐‐ '19?

00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:55,500
And then,
Year 2, 2019,

00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,836
we did $1.9 million.

00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,671
Wow.
Okay, and you made
what on that?

00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:03,508
We had $775,000
gross profit,

00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,476
and we netted
around $500,000.

00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:07,045
And this year,
what are you going to do?

00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:08,112
Year to date?

00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:10,014
Walsh: So, in spite
of the pandemic,

00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,851
our revenues year to date
are up over last year.

00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:16,354
We've done $650,000
revenue so far.

00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:19,390
The opportunity for us
is a lot broader than fantasy.

00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:22,227
So, corporate awards,
employee recognition, U sports.

00:39:22,227 --> 00:39:24,796
But there has to be a ton of
competition in that space.

00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:26,264
A ton.

00:39:26,264 --> 00:39:27,699
There's a reason
why no one

00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:30,368
in the trophy and award space
has really taken

00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,303
a national approach
on e‐commerce.

00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:35,940
The traditional way of
building trophies is crazy.

00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,309
The assembly process
in our first year ‐‐
Was a nightmare.

00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:41,312
Assembly was more expensive
than cost of goods.

00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,882
The way that we developed
our columns,

00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:46,618
the assembly time
was cut down by 90%.

00:39:46,618 --> 00:39:49,053
Now I get it.
You're a logistics guy.
Yeah.

00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:52,090
Everybody else in this space
can't do what you do

00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:54,525
because anybody else would
take years to get up to speed

00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:56,127
to where you are.
Correct.

00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:58,696
Yeah.
Okay, guys,
so I really respect people

00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:00,031
who play sports.

00:40:00,031 --> 00:40:03,201
People that are sports fans,
I kind of respect them.

00:40:03,201 --> 00:40:04,569

[ Laughter ]

00:40:05,637 --> 00:40:06,804
So, let me tell you
a story.

00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:08,239
I was trying to date
this really hot woman.

00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,576
I didn't realize she never
had a date on Sunday

00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:15,380
'cause these morons were
so busy watching sports.

00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:18,116
So, no matter where I was at
in the world,

00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:21,519
I would make sure
that I got to New York on Sunday

00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:24,789
to take out
this smoking hot woman.

00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:26,658
And I remember her telling me,
you know,

00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:28,726
"I really don't like guys
who like sports

00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:32,063
'cause, you know,
I'm alone on Sundays."

00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:36,768
And I said, "I will never watch
a sports game my entire life

00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:39,337
if you marry me,"
and I'm married now.

00:40:39,337 --> 00:40:40,772
That's awesome.
So...

00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:42,206
I'm out.

I'm going to make you an offer.

00:40:46,244 --> 00:40:47,712
I'll give you $600,000

for 25%
of the business,

00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:51,082

00:40:51,082 --> 00:40:52,717
and work it
into the corporate market,

00:40:52,717 --> 00:40:53,885
which isn't that easy.

00:40:53,885 --> 00:40:55,386

What do you want the money for,
and what is it that you need?

We're looking for a strategic
partner, right?

00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:01,926
We don't want to just continue
doubling every year.

00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:03,061
We want to 10x.

00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:05,697
Matt, what would
the strategic partner bring you?

00:41:05,697 --> 00:41:08,900
So, whether it's opening up
the doors at arenas

00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,969
for products
within the stadiums,

00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:13,371

just for Cuban?

I like what you're doing.

I like the fact
that you're hustlers, right,

all the pieces
