the company in 2010,

in food and beverage,

just building the foundation.

retailing in 2013.

of the estimate?

And, actually, the way
we've run our business

00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:48,181
is preorder campaigns.

John: That's very good.

00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,416
So, we bootstrapped
the brand.

00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,385
And last year,
we were at $1.2.

00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:54,187
Yeah!
Oops!

00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:54,821
Yeah.
I got you.

00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:56,489
So, why don't we get
into the margins?

00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,458
What do you --
What's an average margin?

00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,426
Take this shirt,
for example.
Yeah.

00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:03,429
Yeah,
that shirt is $9.40.

00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,398
Oh, wow.
And we sell it
for $60.

00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:07,433
Landed price
for jeans, $15.

00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:08,801
We sell them for $99.
Nice.

00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,671
What did you mean when you
referenced a pre-order campaign?

00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:12,805
How does that work?
Yeah, so,

00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,874
how we were able to bootstrap
is that we launch

00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:17,710
these products at what we call
"intro pricing."

00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,580
So it's usually about
a 50% margin at that point,

00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,448
and that really creates
a sense of urgency

00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:23,483
within our customers.

00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,751
Our repeat customer rate
is 51%.

00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,420
Wow. That's huge.
These people are waiting

00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,588
for our products
to come in.

00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:30,623
And how do you execute that,
exactly?

00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:31,624
I've never heard that.

00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:32,859
So, we launch a product.

00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:34,994
We put it out on e-mail,
social, everywhere,

00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,930
and then the customers go ahead
and pre-order the product,

00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,766
and we usually deliver
within 6 to 10 weeks.

00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,536

COVID, you know, killed us.

00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:44,637

00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:38,624
I scream, she wakes up,
and I still have a house

00:22:38,624 --> 00:22:39,925
full of toys to clean up.

00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:42,194
Toys should bring joy to a home,
not mess.

00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,797
That's why I created
Play Maysie.

00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:47,299
Play Maysie is
a portable dollhouse

00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:50,970
for quality play on the go
and less mess at home.

00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,906
Our cases were inspired
by vintage tin lunch boxes

00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:55,140
that open on both sides

00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,977
to reveal
two interchangeable rooms.

00:22:57,977 --> 00:23:00,779
Our magnetic floors
with attached wooden furniture

00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:03,349
means no loose pieces,
no lost pieces,

00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:06,952
and no more bottom-of-the-foot
owies for moms and dads.

00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:10,022
When playtime is over,
simply close your case,

00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:12,224
put them on a shelf,
stack them in a pile,

00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:17,930
or hang them on a hook for easy
cleanup and all-in-one storage.

00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,298
Whether you're planning
a long car ride

00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:21,934
or just looking to clear
the clutter in your home,

00:23:21,934 --> 00:23:24,303
Play Maysie keeps your child's
imagination active

00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:26,972
and your cleaning to-do list
a little bit shorter.

00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:30,209
So, who's ready to help me save
the soles of parents

00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:32,912
all across America
with Play Maysie?

00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:33,913
Great presentation.
Greiner: It's very cute.

00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,080
So this is it
in front of us?

00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,949
So, in front of you,
you each have a case.

00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:38,751
Mark, you have our wild case.

00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,786
I'm wild, baby.
[ Laughs ]

00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:42,087
The wild case is
camping and fishing.

00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,289
Barbara,
you have our home case,

00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:45,424
which is a kitchen
and living room.
My favorite room.

00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:48,761
Mr. Wonderful, you have red,
so it would match you.
Yes, I like that.

00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:49,929
You could try it on.
Yeah.

00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,063
And, Lori,
you have our cozy case,

00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:52,164
which is a bedroom
and bathroom.

00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:53,999
And, Daymond,
you also have our wild case.

00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:55,034
Wild.

00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:56,201
Well, that's kinda cool.
Greiner: Very cute.

00:23:56,201 --> 00:24:00,105
Thank you. Yes.
It's like
a magnetic dollhouse, right?

00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,273
Are there only
two characters?

00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,309
So, there's a set of
six characters,

00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:05,144
and it was really important
to me, two things --

00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:06,979
to make this very
gender-neutral.

00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:08,180
I believe that doll play,

00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,083
especially for boys,
is very important,

00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,218
and I really wanted everything
to be as inclusive

00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,988
as it could be for the first
launch of the product.

00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:19,858
My goal with this is to expand
the line of cases,

00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:21,260
building out
the character storylines.

00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,195
So, I just finished
the first book

00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:25,197
that the illustrations
are almost done,

00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:28,867
that is about each character,
and I want this to be a brand

00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:30,869
where kids get to know
the characters,

00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:32,204
love the characters.

00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:35,908
I am going to be the next
big toy brand in America.

00:24:35,908 --> 00:24:37,076
Aha!

00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:39,011
Tell us about you.
Tell us your story.

00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:43,115
So, in 2013,
I got divorced.

00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:45,184
I moved out on my own
for the very first time.

00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:46,986
I'd never lived by myself.

00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,188
And I really invested
the next few years

00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:51,924
in building
my photography business.

00:24:51,924 --> 00:24:54,059
And so, I had dated
for a few years.

00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:55,127
Nothing was working out.

00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:56,428
And I kind of jokingly said
to my mom,

00:24:56,428 --> 00:25:00,099
"Maybe someday I'll just adopt
and I'll do this on my own."

00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:02,101
She worked at
an OB/GYN clinic.

00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:04,937
I asked if anyone ever came in
looking to place their baby.

00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:06,038
Wow.
She asked the doctor,

00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:08,307
said it hadn't happened
in 25 years,

00:25:08,307 --> 00:25:10,209
and the next day,
a couple came in asking

00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:11,276
if he knew anyone
looking to adopt.

00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:12,911
Unbelievable.
Oh, wow. That's fate.

00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:13,812
-Wow.
-Wow.

00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:14,246
And that's my daughter

00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:15,714
on the front of the packaging.

00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:16,949
So, it's really been

00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:18,050
an amazing journey.

00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,385
Christmas of 2020 --

00:25:19,385 --> 00:25:21,920
I was a wedding photographer
previously,

00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,422
lost all my business
with COVID.

00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:25,958
And then, Christmas night,
I had this idea,

00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:29,094
and I took my $25,000
personal savings,

00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:30,295
built a Kickstarter.
Damn.

00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:32,398
I filed all of my trademarks.

00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:37,036
I did the provisional patent,
the website, an initial logo.

00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,971
Okay, what does
it cost landed? All --

00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:40,372
So, landed is about $13.

00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,342
Including all
the components?
Including everything.

00:25:43,342 --> 00:25:45,444
And that's --
And what do you
sell it for online?

00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:49,915
I sell them for $49.99,
so we have about a 70% margin.

00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,150
So, tell us about
the business.

00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:54,887
Yeah, so I launched
my Kickstarter March of 2021.

00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:55,387
How much did you
try to raise,

00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,089
and how much did you
end up raising?

00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:59,024
So, I had tried to
raise $25,000.

00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:02,061
I ended up raising $30,000,
all organically.

00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:04,263
I immediately took
that $30,000

00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:07,433
and started the molds
for the tins.

00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:09,868
I was short on money
for the production run,

00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:11,136
so I sold my car.

00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:15,474
We received the product
November 15th, and then

00:26:15,474 --> 00:26:21,180
we ended up closing out 2021
with total revenue of $170,000.

00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,081
-Wow!
-Wow!

00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,148
Good for you.

00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:24,349
And what are your
year-to-date sales?

00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:26,318
So, I ran into an issue.
[ Laughs ]

00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:30,989
So, I knew that I was going to
receive a purchase order,

00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:33,225
and they wouldn't tell me

00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:35,227
how much inventory
it was going to be for.

00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:36,295
That's difficult.

00:26:36,295 --> 00:26:38,263
But in order for me
to get it in time,

00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,998
I needed to place the order

00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:41,166
before I would know
the quantity.

00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:43,302
So I ordered
5,000 units.

00:26:43,302 --> 00:26:45,337
How much did they
wind up ordering?

00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:47,139
So they only ordered
a few hundred cases.

00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:48,140
Oh, God.

00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,475
I did find an investor.

00:26:49,475 --> 00:26:54,046
They invested $85,000 to pay for
the inventory and the shipping.

00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:55,414
They took 10%, and it has been

00:26:55,414 --> 00:26:59,051
the biggest blessing to be able
to get there.

00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:01,520
Sales year to date,
I think, are $55,000.

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,190
And what do you think it will be
the end of the year?

00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,392
I think I'll be around $400,000
at the end of the year.

00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,062
$400,000? How much inventory
do you have on hand?

00:27:10,062 --> 00:27:11,163
What is it worth
right now?

00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:13,165
I have just over
9,000 units on hand,

00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:15,334
and that's worth about
half a million in revenue.

00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:17,369
Okay. I don't feel
like I've gotten

00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:20,372
the -- the vision
of growth clearly.

00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:21,507
Okay.
I like the product.

00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:24,143
However, as for the business,
I'm out.

00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,445
Okay.
Thank you so much, Daymond.

00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:30,182
Kayla, this is very admirable,
what you've done, okay?

00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:32,017
Thank you.
I'm out.

00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,152
This is not
a business for me.

00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:34,353
Okay.

00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:37,189
Kayla, one,
quite impressed...
Thank you.

00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:39,191
...that you didn't know
how to do any of this

00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:43,095
and you created rapidly
a really wonderful toy.

00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:45,197
But I go for
the three P's --

00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:47,499
passion, perseverance,
and product.

00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,402
And for me, you're passion,
you're perseverance.

00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:53,238
But the product just isn't
the right product for me.

00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:55,941
Okay. Okay.
I wish you good luck,
but I'm out.

00:27:55,941 --> 00:27:57,142
Thank you so much.

00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:59,244
Yeah, Kayla,
you deserve a ton of credit.

00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:01,180
I mean, the adversity
you fought through.

00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,381
But you're also
in a great position,

00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:04,650
and I don't think you're giving
yourself enough credit there.

00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:08,287
And if you just keep it simple,
you can have a business

00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:11,356
where you're making $200,000,
$300,000, $400,000 a year,

00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:14,359
starting next year,
and then look to scale.
Okay.

00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,361
I think you're trying to do
too much too soon.

00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,131
Okay.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:20,465
Well, I appreciate that.
You're welcome.

00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:22,434
I'm happy you saved
the best for last.

00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:26,238
I don't think there's
a more adorable product
than what I see here.

00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:29,041
It's well-designed.
It's well-thought-through.

00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:31,143
Everything
packages so well.

00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:33,278
But more important
than the business,

00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:34,279
[Voice breaking]
you've got the courage.

00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,380
Thank you.

00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,049
You demonstrated the courage
all along the way

00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,283
to be who
you wanted to be.

00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:41,220
I'm so overwhelmed
by that, alright?

00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,488
I think the idea that
you became a single mother --

00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:46,959
1 in 100 women who say that
actually do it.

00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:48,360
You went and did it,

00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,461
and you deserve
the good luck

00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:51,296
of finding your daughter,
of course.

00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:53,765
When I was a little kid,
my mother invented this.

00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:57,436
Her toys for the ten of us
were the Sears Roebuck catalog

00:28:57,436 --> 00:29:02,407
where we cut out beds and plates
and sheets and made our houses,

00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,509
and she painted
all the clothespins

00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:07,346
that she hung the wash with,
all different figures,

00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:11,116
and we played with it
for hours and hours every day.

00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:12,251
I don't know why
they're not buying in,

00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,452
but if they're not
buying in,

00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:15,487
I'm going to make you
a greedy offer...
Okay.

00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,356
...because I have
no competition.
Okay.

00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:21,593
Okay. So, I would like to have
$150,000 for 30%

00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,563
and $5 per portable dollhouse
you sell

00:29:24,563 --> 00:29:27,232
until I recoup
my investment.

00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:28,200
O'Leary: That's outrageous!
Whoa.

00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,301
Wow.
Barbara!

00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:31,103
Ooh, Kevin, how can you make
an offer like that, Kevin?

00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,537
Oh, my goodness.

00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:38,343
Would you be willing to either
