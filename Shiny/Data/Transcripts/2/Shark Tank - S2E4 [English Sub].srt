00:00:01,969 --> 00:00:05,672
<i>(man) TONIGHT, JEFF FOXWORTHY</i>
<i>JOINS THE SHARK TANK,</i>

00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,174
<i>WHERE HOPEFUL ENTREPRENEURS</i>

00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:10,210
<i>COME SEEKING AN INVESTMENT</i>
<i>FROM THE SHARKS,</i>

00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:14,081
<i>FIVE POWERFUL, SELF‐MADE</i>
<i>INVESTORS WORTH BILLIONS.</i>

00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:16,149
<i>IN THE TANK, THE SHARKS</i>

00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,519
<i>ARE READY TO INVEST</i>
<i>USING THEIR OWN MONEY...</i>

00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:21,388
<i>BUT ONLY FOR THE RIGHT PERSON</i>
<i>WITH THE RIGHT BUSINESS.</i>

00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:23,524
T‐SHIRTS, HATS, AND TANK TOPS
ARE ONLY THE BEGINNING.

00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,993
I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU
TO VINNY PASTORE,

00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:28,395
STAR OF "SOPRANOS."
YOU KNOW YOU'RE A REDNECK

00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:30,664
WHEN YOUR KIDS ARE STRAPPED
TO YOUR LUGGAGE.
(laughs)

00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:33,267
<i>AND IF THE SHARKS HEAR</i>
<i>A GOOD IDEA,</i>

00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:36,670
<i>THEY'LL FIGHT EACH OTHER</i>
<i>FOR A PIECE OF IT.</i>
I THINK THAT HE'S GIVING YOU
A SUCKER DEAL.

00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,540
HE MAKES NOISE. TYPICAL.
NOBODY WANTS
TO DO BUSINESS WITH YOU.

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,842
MY DEALS ARE GOOD.
(laughs)

00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:43,911
<i>BUT FIRST THE ENTREPRENEURS</i>

00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:46,413
<i>MUST CONVINCE A SHARK</i>
<i>TO INVEST THE FULL AMOUNT</i>

00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:51,385
<i>THEY'RE ASKING FOR OR THEY'LL</i>
<i>WALK AWAY WITH NOTHING.</i>
WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO
GIVE UP OUR WHOLE DREAM.

00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:54,721
YOU'RE NOT SELLING THAT MUCH.
WORSE THING I'VE HEARD
ON THIS SHOW.

00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,823
<i>WHO ARE THE SHARKS?</i>

00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:58,825
<i>KEVIN O'LEARY</i>

00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:01,662
<i>HE STARTED A SOFTWARE BUSINESS</i>
<i>IN HIS BASEMENT,</i>

00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:04,998
<i>WHICH HE EVENTUALLY SOLD</i>

<i>WORTH HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS</i>

<i>IN THE SHARK‐FILLED CITY</i>

<i>TO HELP EASE THE STRESS</i>

00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:00,520
COME ON, HONEY.

00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,656
♪♪♪

00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:05,092
(Darryl) COME ON.

00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:08,061
COME ON, HONEY.

00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:14,334
HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS DARRYL.

00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:17,337
THIS IS MY HUSBAND RANDY.
WE'RE FROM ATLANTA, GEORGIA.

00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,873
AND OUR BUSINESS
IS RIDE ON CARRY ON.

00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:22,142
WE'RE ASKING FOR $50,000

00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:27,180
FOR A 25% EQUITY
IN OUR BUSINESS.

00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,750
NOW DOES THIS LOOK LIKE
THE WAY TO TRAVEL?

00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,153
ANYONE WHO'S TRAVELED TODAY
HAS SEEN THIS SCENARIO PLAY OUT

00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:37,024
IN AIRPORTS ALL ACROSS
THE COUNTRY EVERY DAY.

00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:40,060
NOW I'VE BEEN A FLIGHT ATTENDANT
FOR 27 YEARS.

00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,598
I'VE WATCHED COUNTLESS FAMILIES
DEAL WITH THE FRUSTRATIONS

00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:46,933
OF TRAVELING
WITH SMALL CHILDREN.

00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:50,637
ANYONE WHO HAS KIDS
KNOWS HOW STRESSFUL IT CAN BE.

00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:53,040
BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVE
AT THE AIRPORT,

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,042
YOU'RE DEALING WITH...
(laughs)

00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:58,345
PULLING YOUR CUMBERSOME STROLLER
OUT OF THE TRUNK OF YOUR CAR...

00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,414
(grunts) OH, CAN YOU HOLD
MY DAUGHTER?

00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:02,549
OH, THANK YOU. OH, SORRY.
SURE. BE HAPPY TO.

00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,384
(laughs)
OH.

00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,386
BY THE TIME
YOU GET TO YOUR GATE,

00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,588
YOU ARE TEARING
YOUR HAIRS OUT.

00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,424
IT'S JUST A NIGHTMARE.

00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,492
THAT'S WHY RANDY AND I

00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:16,163
CAME UP WITH
THE RIDE ON CARRY ON.
(Robert laughs)

00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:18,999
NOW THE RIDE ON CARRY ON
INSTANTLY CONVERTS

00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:22,502
ANY WHEELED CARRY‐ON LUGGAGE
INTO A TRAVEL STROLLER.

00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:25,806
IT CARRIES ANY CHILD
8 MONTHS TO 5 YEARS

00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:27,808
SAFELY AND COMFORTABLY
THROUGH ANY AIRPORT,

00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,810
TRAIN STATION, OR BUS STATION.

00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,180
ONCE THERE,
YOUR LITTLE ONE HOPS OUT.

00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,217
THE RIDE ON CARRY ON FOLDS
AGAINST THE TOP OF THE LUGGAGE.

00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,753
IT EASILY STOWS
IN THE OVERHEAD BIN.

00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:41,755
WHEN YOU GET
TO YOUR FINAL DESTINATION,

00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,990
YOU PULL YOUR LUGGAGE DOWN,
YOU OPEN THE SEAT,

00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,426
YOUR LITTLE ONE HOPS IN,
BUCKLE THE SEAT BELT,

00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,061
AND AWAY YOU GO.

00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,663
IT'S SO EASY.

00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:52,733
WE'VE ALSO DESIGNED A HEADREST
FOR TALLER CHILDREN.

00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:57,037
IT EASILY CONVERTS
INTO A HANDY TRAY TABLE

00:03:57,037 --> 00:04:00,006
FOR EATING AND PLAYING
WHILE YOU WAIT.

00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:04,077
NOW WE HAVE SOLD THOUSANDS
OF THESE ON THE INTERNET.

00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:07,214
BUT WE NEED YOUR HELP GETTING
INTO THE RETAIL MARKET,

00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:09,216
BECAUSE IT IS TIME FOR PEOPLE

00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:12,252
TO TAKE THE STRESS OUT OF
TRAVELING WITH LITTLE ONES.

00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,055
THE KIDS ABSOLUTELY LOVE
THE RIDE.

00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:17,591
PARENTS LOVE THE CONVENIENCE.

00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,727
ANY QUESTIONS?
YES. YOUR DAUGHTER'S
NOT BREATHING.

00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,529
UH, Y‐YEAH, SHE'S QUIET.
SHE LOOKS‐‐SHE'S NOT‐‐

00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:25,065
NO, SHE'S QUIET.
SHE'S NOT HAPPY BECAUSE SHE'S
NOT IN A RIDE ON CARRY ON.

00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:28,135
I THOUGHT THE RIDE AND CARRY
MIGHT HAVE KILLED HER.
YEAH, EXACTLY.
EXACTLY. (laughs)

00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:31,004
DARRYL, YOU HAVE A LAWN CHAIR
STRAPPED TO A PIECE OF LUGGAGE.

00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,206
EXACTLY.
WELL, THAT'S WHERE WE STARTED.

00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,976
MY FRIENDS AND PILOTS
AND FLIGHT ATTENDANTS

00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,978
HELPED US DESIGN, UH,
THE WHOLE CHAIR.

00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:40,680
THEY TOOK OUR PROTOTYPES
ON TRIPS.

00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,048
AND IT JUST WAS PHENOMENAL‐‐

00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:45,418
THE ATTENTION EVERYBODY GOT, UH,
WHEELING THROUGH THE AIRPORT‐‐

00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:48,054
AND THAT'S WHEN WE KNEW
WE REALLY HAD SOMETHING.

00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,724
AND WHAT AGE
WILL IT WORK?

00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:53,059
8 MONTHS TO 5 YEARS.

00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:56,863
WE, UM, MY DAUGHTER USED IT
TILL SHE WAS ABOUT 6. CHILDREN‐‐

00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:59,866
IS THERE A SEAT BELT
ON IT?
THERE ABSOLUTELY IS A SEAT BELT
WITH A CROTCH STRAP, YEAH.

00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:02,969
(Randy) 3‐POINT‐‐
ARE‐‐ARE YOU SELLING
THE CHAIR SEPARATELY,

00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,173
AND THEN I STRAP IT ON
TO ANY PIECE OF LUGGAGE?
(Darryl and Randy) YES.

00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:09,176
THAT'S HOW WE DESIGNED IT.
YOU SAID THOUSANDS
HAVE BEEN SOLD. HOW‐‐

00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:11,845
WE SOLD UP‐‐ALMOST 20,000
OUT OF OUR HOUSE.

00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:14,414
WHAT HAS BEEN YOUR NUMBER
IN THE LAST YEAR?

00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,583
WE SOLD 2,000 CHAIRS
LAST YEAR.

00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,185
AT WHAT PRICE?

00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:21,087
(Darryl and Randy) $39.95.
AND WHAT DO YOU PAY
TO MAKE ONE?

00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:24,191
$7.
(Barbara and Robert) $7?

00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:26,259
(Darryl) YES.
GOOD MARGIN.

00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:29,029
(Jeff) WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND?
I'M A POOL MAN,
IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT.

00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:31,932
WERE YOU MARRIED BEFORE AND HE‐‐
RANDY WAS THE POOL MAN?

00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:34,868
NO.
NO, NO, THAT NEVER HAPPENS.
IT'S ONLY IN THE MOVIES.

00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:37,170
OH. (laughs)
YEAH, YEAH, ONLY‐‐
ONLY IN THE MOVIES.

00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,639
WE MET IN A BAR
IN FORT LAUDERDALE 19 YEARS AGO.

00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,876
STICK WITH THE POOL MAN STORY.
IT'S BETTER.
(laughs) YEAH, EXACTLY.
EXACTLY. EXACTLY.

00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:46,313
FIRST OF ALL, I‐I LOVE
A‐A WOMAN NAMED DARRYL.

00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:48,148
(laughs) THANK YOU.
(laughs)

00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:50,550
BECAUSE MY WIFE'S NAME
IS GREGG.

00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,586
OH. I FEEL FOR HER, TOO.
(laughs)

00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:54,988
MY FIRST THOUGHT IS, YOU'VE
NEVER HAD ANY SAFETY ISSUES?

00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:57,691
BECAUSE I DO WORRY ABOUT
THE LIABILITY ON THIS.

00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:58,992
ABSOLUTELY.

00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:01,428
IT'S BEEN SAFETY TESTED
IN THE U. S. AND IN EUROPE.

00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:03,263
PASSED ALL THE SAFETY TESTS.

00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:07,534
UH, ALL THE CHAIRS WE'VE SOLD
HAVE HAD NO SAFETY ISSUES.

00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,503
WE HAVEN'T EVEN HAD
ONE COMPLAINT.
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN DOING THIS?

00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,873
WHEN WE CAME OUT
WITH THE IDEA‐‐

00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,175
OUR SON WAS 2
WHEN WE THOUGHT OF IT.

00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:16,743
HE'S 16 NOW, BUT WE‐‐

00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:19,145
YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS
FOR 14 YEARS?

00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,147
THE FIRST FIVE OR SIX YEARS,
WE PLAYED WITH THE IDEA.

00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,717
I HAD TO CONVINCE MY HUSBAND
TO INVEST IN THE PATENT.

00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,653
YOU KNOW, THAT TOOK SOME TIME.
WE MORTGAGED THE HOUSE
FOR $150,000.

00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:29,189
MORTGAGED THE HOUSE.
DID YOU MAKE BACK
THAT $150,000?

00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:32,192
WE HAVE NO DEBT.
YEAH, WE HAVE NO DEBT.
WE'RE IN THE BLACK.

00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:35,095
AND YOU MADE IT BACK
WITH THE CHAIRS?
(Darryl and Randy) YES.

00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:39,099
(Robert)
WOW. GOOD FOR YOU.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO
WITH THE $50,000?

00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,067
PRODUCT AWARENESS.
GET OUR WEB SITE‐‐

00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,069
IT'S NOT OPTIMIZED AT ALL.
OPTIMIZE THE WEB SITE.

00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,138
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
IT EXISTS.

00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,540
LET'S GET BACK TO THE PATH
TO RICHES HERE.

00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,542
FORGET ALL THIS "YOU DO
YOUR OWN RETAIL" STUFF.

00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:52,012
YOU KNOW
THAT'S A SLAUGHTERFEST.

00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,648
WE REALLY THOUGHT THAT, UM,
GETTING INTO THE RETAIL MARKET

00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:56,650
WOULD BE THE WAY TO GO.

00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,652
WE WANT PEOPLE
TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:00,587
TO BUY THIS PRODUCT.

00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,822
AS A PARENT,
I WOULD BE INTERESTED

00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:05,659
TO HAVE A‐A MAJOR LUGGAGE
MANUFACTURER...

00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:08,662
RIGHT.
HAVE‐‐HAVE A MODEL
WHERE THIS IS BUILT IN.

00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:11,031
THE REALITY IS, THOUGH,
LUGGAGE IS VERY EXPENSIVE.

00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:14,467
IS SOMEBODY GONNA BUY
A SPECIAL PIECE OF LUGGAGE

00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,469
JUST TO HAUL
THEIR CHILDREN AROUND?

00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:19,072
WHAT IF THEIR CHILDREN
AREN'T TRAVELING WITH THEM?
(Kevin) I'LL TELL YOU, RANDY...

00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:21,708
SO‐‐
YOU COULD ADD ONE FEATURE
TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:24,744
MAKE IT SO I COULD CHECK
THE KID WITH THE LUGGAGE.
(laughs)

00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,980
(laughs)
AND HOW MUCH INVENTORY
DO YOU HAVE?

00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,683
(Darryl and Randy) ZERO.

00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:31,584
HOW MANY ORDERS
DO YOU HAVE PENDING?

00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,520
WE HAVE 2,000 RIGHT NOW,
PENDING‐‐

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,989
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT THERE
ARE RETAILERS OUT THERE

00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:39,192
OR SOMEBODY EXISTING SAYING
THAT WE NEED 2,000 OF THESE?

00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:42,162
(Darryl and Randy) YES.
I THINK YOU'VE GOT
A GREAT IDEA.

00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:45,665
AND THAT'S 90% OF IT.
WHEN WE HEARD YOU MIGHT BE ON,
WE SAID,

00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,567
YOU KNOW YOU'RE A REDNECK
WHEN YOUR KIDS

00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:50,637
ARE STRAPPED TO YOUR LUGGAGE
GOING THROUGH THE AIRPORT.
(Robert laughs) YEAH.

00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,340
THAT'S NOT EVEN YOU MIGHT BE.
YOU ARE. YOU ARE AT THAT POINT.

IT IS REALLY, HANDS DOWN‐‐

00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:29,322
CAREFUL NOW, KEN.
(laughs)

00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:32,191
(Ken) EVERYBODY LOVES
THE BEEF JERKY.

00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,498
WHAT'S THE STORY? IS THIS
THE BEST YOU'VE EVER EATEN?

00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,504
IT'S GOOD, VERY GOOD.

00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:47,840
THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE THAT.

00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,976
KEN, WHY IS IT CALLED
UNCLE ZIP?

00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:52,111
MY FATHER WAS ACTUALLY
IN THE YELLOW PAGE SALES,

00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:54,113
AND HE WAS REALLY, REALLY GOOD.

00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:58,117
HE COULD ZIP IN, ZIP OUT
WITH A SALE, SO ZIP STUCK.

00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:01,220
WELL, HE ORIGINALLY STARTED
THE BEEF JERKY. HE WAS LIKE,

00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,456
"WELL, YOU KNOW, WE'RE GONNA DO
ZIP'S BEEF JERKY."

00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:05,825
SO I SAID, "YEAH, YEAH,"
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE GOES,

00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:08,127
"YEAH, GOOD OL' UNCLE ZIP,"
AND I WENT... "(gasps)

00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:10,129
THAT'S IT.
UNCLE ZIP'S BEEF JERKY."

00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:11,497
I SAID,
"THAT'D BE PERFECT."

00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:13,799
NOW EVERYBODY KNOWS ME AS EITHER
UNCLE ZIP OR JERKY MAN.

00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:17,103
HONESTLY, I CAN GO WALKING INTO
A‐ANY STORE,

00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:20,273
AND I'LL HEAR, "JERKY MAN.
HEY, HEY, JERKY MAN. JERKY MAN.

00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:21,541
JERKY MAN."
(sharks laugh)

00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,343
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING.
THIS IS PRETTY GOOD.
THANK YOU.

00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:26,979
HOW DOES IT STAY IN THE PACKAGE
WITHOUT PRESERVATIVES,

00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,982
WITHOUT CHEMICALS?
DOES IT GO BAD RIGHT AWAY?
NO, IT DOESN'T GO BAD
RIGHT AWAY,

00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,617
BUT HERE'S THE THING,

00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:35,154
I PUT ABOUT A TWO MONTH,
UM, SHELF LIFE ON IT.

00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:37,323
ISN'T THAT A PROBLEM?
DOESN'T THAT BEEF JERKY

00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:40,326
STAY ON FOR YEARS
ON THE SHELF?
EXACTLY, AND THE REASON WHY
IT DOES STAY ON FOR YEARS

00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:42,328
IS BECAUSE OF THOSE‐‐
LIKE I SAID BEFORE,

00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:44,363
IS THOSE CHEMICALS
THAT ARE IN THERE,

00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:46,499
AND THAT'S ALL
YOU'RE TASTING.

00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:49,268
HOW MUCH SALES HAVE YOU HAD
IN THE LAST YEAR?

00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:52,004
RIGHT. WELL, UNFORTUNATELY...
IN THE LAST‐‐IN THE LAST‐‐

00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,774
OH! YOU'RE STARTING OFF
WITH "UNFORTUNATELY"? LET'S GO.

00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:57,777
WELL, IN THE LAST COUPLE OF‐‐
ACTUALLY, THE LAST SEVEN YEARS,

00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:00,780
I‐I'VE BEEN KINDA DOWN
FOR THE SIMPLE FACT THAT

00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,782
I LOST MY‐‐I LOST MY FATHER.

00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:04,917
I'M ALMOST
IN A REBUILDING STAGE.

00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,187
YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS
FOR SEVEN YEARS?

00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:11,691
I‐I'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR
RIGHT AT TEN YEARS NOW.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?

00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:14,527
THE HIGHEST SALES,
I WAS RIGHT AT $100,000.

00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:16,362
THAT WAS RIGHT BEFORE
MY DAD TOOK ILL.

00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:19,131
AND WHAT WERE YOUR SALES
LAST YEAR?

00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,033
UM, IT WAS‐‐
YOU'RE PROBABLY LOOKING‐‐

00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,636
IT WAS ABOUT
$40,000 OR $50,000.

00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:26,305
NOW WHAT DO YOU WANT
THE $25,000 FOR, KEN?

00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:29,308
THE $25,000 IS‐‐WE'RE GONNA
START OUT BY UPGRADING

00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,110
THE‐‐THE, UM,
PROCESSING FACILITY

00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,812
I ALREADY HAVE.

00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:34,714
THAT'S GONNA ALLOW US

00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:37,083
TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND
INTO THESE LARGER MARKETS.

00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:40,386
ONCE WE GET IN THERE, WE'LL HAVE
SMALL PROCESSING PLANTS.

00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:42,488
AND YOU'RE LOOKING
TO OPEN UP ON OF THESE,

00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,890
YOU'RE LOOKING ABOUT $60,000,
AND THAT'S THE‐‐

00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,892
(Robert) BUT, KEN,
ISN'T THAT JUST CRAZY?

00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,894
EVERY TIME YOU OPEN UP
A NEW REGION,

00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,297
YOU NEED
A NEW PROCESSING PLANT?

00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:54,300
WELL, THAT‐‐THAT NEW REGION
IS GONNA BE ABLE TO PUT

00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,268
FRESH BEEF JERKY ON THE SHELF

00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:59,372
THAT OTHERWISE HAS BEEN
SITTING THERE FOR A YEAR.

00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:01,207
AND THAT'S THE THING‐‐

00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:03,542
NOBODY KNOWS REALLY FRESH
BEEF JERKY.

00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:06,312
I DON'T THINK
THE PROBLEM IS GONNA BE

00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,314
HAVING THE LOCAL
PROCESSING PLANT.

00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:11,317
I DON'T THINK YOUR SHELF LIFE
IS LONG ENOUGH.

00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,355
YOU CAN'T BE MAKING A LIVING
ON‐‐ON THIS.

00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,357
WELL, I‐I DO HAVE
A LITTLE PART‐TIME‐‐

00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:23,062
I GOT A CARPET BUSINESS
THAT I DO‐‐DO PART‐TIME, TOO.
KEN, IT'S BEEN TEN YEARS,

00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:25,131
AND YOU'RE STILL NOT MAKING
A LIVING DOING IT.

00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:29,168
I'M STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE STILL DOING IT.

00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,937
ARE YOU STILL DOING IT

00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,673
BECAUSE IT'S A BUSINESS?

00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:39,779
IS THIS SOME KIND OF A TRIBUTE
TO YOUR DAD?

00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:41,781
IT DOES LEAN
A LITTLE BIT TOWARDS,

00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:44,116
THAT WAS MY DAD,
AND HE WANTED THE BUSINESS.

00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:47,286
AND WE TALKED MANY TIMES

00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:49,955
ABOUT WANTING
TO PUT IT ON SHELVES.

00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:52,191
AND I JUST‐‐I JUST KNOW
I CAN DO IT.

00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,194
JUST LIKE ANY BUSINESS, WHEN
THEY HIT THAT‐‐THAT LITTLE HUMP,

00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,464
THEY JUST NEED THAT LITTLE BOOST
OF CAPITAL TO GET ROLLING AGAIN.

00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:01,167
AND I‐‐AND I REALLY THINK
THIS RIGHT HERE,

00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:03,269
PARTNERING UP WITH YOU GUYS‐‐

00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:05,271
ONE OF YOU, TWO OF YOU,
ALL OF YOU‐‐

00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:08,207
I REALLY THINK THAT WE CAN
GET THIS BACK‐‐BACK ON TRACK

00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,876
AND GET GOING AGAIN.

00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,678
(Robert) KEN,
WE ALL HAVE A DREAM.

00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:16,449
BUT NOT ONLY DOES EVERY DREAM
HAVE A PRICE,

00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:20,119
EVERY DREAM HAS A SHELF LIFE,
JUST LIKE YOUR BEEF JERKY.

00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:22,388
RIGHT.

00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:25,324
THIS ISN'T
AN INVESTABLE BUSINESS.

00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:26,959
I'M OUT.

00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,028
OKAY. OKAY.

00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:32,131
THIS IS A SMALL BUSINESS,
NOT AN INVESTMENT.

00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,835
I'M OUT.

00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:43,642
I'M GONNA TELL IT

00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:46,212
LOOK, I LOVE THE STORY,
I LOVE THE PAST,

00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:49,715
I LOVE ALL THAT STUFF,
BUT I'M AN INVESTOR, ALL RIGHT?

00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:52,618
WHAT YOU PRESENTED
IS A SMALL, REGIONAL BRAND‐‐

00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:55,121
A MICRO BRAND, REALLY SMALL.

00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:57,389
IT'S GOOD. I ATE IT.
IT IS FRESH. THAT'S GREAT.

00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:01,293
THE TROUBLE IS,
YOU'RE NOT SELLING THAT MUCH.

00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,462
I'M OUT.

00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,564

I'M GONNA SAY THIS.

00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:16,142
YOU'VE GOT A GOOD PRODUCT.
OKAY.

00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:19,278
IT TASTES FRESH.
IT TASTES GOOD.

00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,547
I'M OUT...

00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:24,416
BUT MAINLY BECAUSE
I'M IN THE SAME BUSINESS.
RIGHT, RIGHT.

00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,452
BUT I THINK
YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING HERE

00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:29,889
THAT YOU COULD MAKE A GOOD
LIVING ON WITH THE RIGHT THINGS.

00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:31,891
I DON'T THINK
IT'S BIG ENOUGH YET

00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:34,059
FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO COME IN
AND INVEST IN IT,

00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,195
BUT YOUR PRODUCT'S GOOD ENOUGH
THAT YOU COULD MAKE

00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:38,697
A GOOD LIVING ON IT.
YOU KNOW, YOU MADE $100,000

00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:41,133
IN YOUR THIRD YEAR
IN THE BUSINESS, OKAY?

00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,102
THEN YOU CAME THROUGH
YEARS OF HARDSHIP

00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:45,704
FOR ONE REASON OR THE OTHER.

00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:48,040
MUCH MORE DIFFICULT OBSTACLES
TO OVERCOME

00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,675
THAN SELLING BEEF JERKY.
RIGHT.

00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:51,677
THERE'S NO HELP YOU NEED
FROM ANYBODY

00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:54,280
TO GET THIS BACK ON THE ROAD.

00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,650
YOU'VE GOT IT IN YOU.
I DON'T THINK YOU NEED US HERE.

00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,486
YOU'RE VERY CAPABLE
OF GETTING BACK ON YOUR FEET,

00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:03,122
SO I'M OUT.

00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:07,326
ALL RIGHT. THANKS, Y'ALL.
I APPRECIATE IT.

00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,362

THE HillBilly LOGO HE CREATED,

00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:47,553
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT.

00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:49,555
WE WENT TO OUR FIRST EVENT,
A SMALL LOCAL RODEO,

00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:52,691
AND WE SOLD EVERYTHING
WE BROUGHT IN FOUR HOURS.

00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:56,061
WE KNEW WE WERE
ONTO SOMETHING BIG.
NOW THE TERM "HILLBILLY"
IS NOT WHAT IT USED TO BE.

00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:58,063
PEOPLE LOVE THE BRAND.
THEY WEAR IT PROUD.

00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:00,366
IT REPRESENTS THEIR LIFESTYLE‐‐
THE COUNTRY LIFESTYLE.

00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:02,835
I WANT YOU TO THINK OUTDOORS‐‐
HUNTING, FISHING, SKIING,

00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:05,104
AND MORE. AND COUNTRY MUSIC
AND NASCAR FANS ARE AMONG

00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:07,873
THE MOST LOYAL CONSUMERS.
AND THERE'S MILLIONS OF 'EM,

00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:10,376
SO THIS IS JUST
THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.

00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:12,378
T‐SHIRTS, HATS, AND TANK TOPS
ARE ONLY THE BEGINNING.

00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:15,714
OUR CUSTOMERS ARE ASKING US
FOR BLUE JEANS, BATHING SUITS,

00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:18,650
FISHING GEAR, HUNTING GEAR,
AND BACKPACKS.

00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,953
WE CAN PUT THIS LOGO
ON JUST ABOUT ANYTHING.

00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:22,588
I'M TELLING YOU GUYS,

00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:24,723
THE PRODUCT AND LICENSING
OPPORTUNITIES ARE ENDLESS.

00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:26,725
WITH THE RIGHT MANUFACTURING,
DISTRIBUTION, AND MARKETING,

00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:30,062
HillBilly BRAND WILL BE
A HOUSEHOLD NAME.

00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:34,233
EVERYBODY'S GOT A LITTLE
HILLBILLY IN 'EM. FIND YOURS.
FIND YOURS. AND, JEFF,
YOU MIGHT BE A REDNECK,

00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:36,068
BUT WE KNOW YOU GOT
A LITTLE HILLBILLY IN YOU.

00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:38,904
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
A HILLBILLY AND A REDNECK?

00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:40,906
I'VE ALWAYS DEFINED REDNECK

00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:44,376
AS A GLORIOUS ABSENCE
OF SOPHISTICATION.
(sharks laugh)

00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:47,179
AND IT REALLY DIDN'T MATTER
HOW MUCH MONEY YOU HAD.

00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:49,548
RIGHT.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
I'VE KNOWN RICH GUYS

00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,517
THAT CAME HOME
AND POPPED A BEER

00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:53,552
AND SAT OUT ON THE PORCH
AND WATCHED THE BUG ZAPPER.

00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,055
(laughs)
I MEAN,
THAT'S QUALITY ENTERTAINMENT.

00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,023
I‐I MEAN, I THINK
IT'S THE SAME ATTITUDE.

00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:00,726
IT'S A FUN, "DON'T WORRY ABOUT
TOO MANY THINGS" KINDA ATTITUDE.

00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:03,195
AND‐‐AND I LIKED YOUR STUFF.

00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:05,264
GUYS, DO YOU HAVE ANY SALES?

00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:07,733
YES. (chuckles)
YES. SO FAR,
WE'VE SOLD ABOUT $271,000

00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:10,836
IN A LITTLE OVER
3 AND A HALF YEARS.
NEVER ANSWER A SALES QUESTION

00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:13,505
WITH WHAT YOU'VE SOLD
OVER THREE YEARS.
YEP.

00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:15,741
THAT ALWAYS MAKES ME THINK
YOUR SALES AREN'T VERY GOOD.

00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:19,545
WHAT'D YOU SELL
IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS?
SO FAR,
ABOUT $50,000 THIS YEAR,

00:26:19,545 --> 00:26:21,580
WE'RE ON TRACK TO DO
$60,000.

00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,016
DO YOU HAVE ANY DISTRIBUTION?
WHERE'S THIS STUFF SOLD?

00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:27,186
UH, WE DO EVENT SALES.
WE DO ABOUT 12 A YEAR.

00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:29,288
ONE A MONTH.
YOU HAVE NO RETAIL DISTRIBUTION.

00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:31,290
WELL, WE JUST ACTUALLY SIGNED
A VENDOR AGREEMENT

00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,725
WITH SPORTS AUTHORITY, AND WE'RE
GONNA START IN APPROXIMATELY

00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,894
30 STORES IN THE SOUTHEAST.
AND WE GOT PICKED UP

00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:38,530
BY A DISTRIBUTION
COMPANY CALLED BARJAN,

00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,200
WHICH DISTRIBUTE PRODUCTS
TO ALL THE TRAVEL PLAZAS

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,168
AND TRUCK STOPS
ACROSS THE NATION.

00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:45,671
SO YOU OWN THE NAME HillBilly?
YES. WE ACT‐‐WE OWN‐‐

00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:47,272
IN WHAT CATEGORIES?

00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:50,042
WE OWN‐‐WE OWN THE BRAND
AS FAR AS THE DESIGN LOGO

00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:53,512
AND WE OWN JUST THE WORD
"HillBilly" FOR APPAREL‐‐

00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:55,347
BELTS, T‐SHIRTS, HATS.

00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:58,016
AND WE HAVE THREE TRADEMARKS
IN THE U. S. AND ONE IN CANADA.

00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:00,219
(Robert) MIKE,
HERE'S MY CHALLENGE WITH IT.

00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:02,521
HOW WOULD YOU EVER
GET YOUR NAME OUT THERE?

00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:06,258
LIKE, THE ADVERTISING COSTS
TO BUILD A BRAND,

00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:09,761
IF YOU'RE NOT A BRAND ALREADY,
WOULD COST MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:11,797
YOU'RE ASKING FOR $50,000.

00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:13,799
WELL, HERE'S‐‐HERE'S WHAT
WE'VE DONE SO FAR.

00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:16,735
WE'VE CLOSELY ALIGNED OURSELVES
WITH COUNTRY MUSIC.

00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,837
YOU KNOW, WE GO OUT
TO THE CONCERTS,

00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:22,207
WE SET UP OUR TENT,
AND MOST OF THE TIME,

00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,943
WE SELL MORE T‐SHIRTS
THAN THE ARTISTS DO.

00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:27,679
SO IN A TYPICAL EVENT, HOW MANY
T‐SHIRTS WOULD YOU SELL?

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,848
IT'S IT'S A BIG CONCERT, UM,
IF IT'S 20,000 PEOPLE,

00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:32,084
WE CAN SELL AS MUCH AS $10,000.

00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:34,219
BUT THAT‐‐THAT'S NOT
A NET NUMBER

00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:36,588
BECAUSE I‐I MEAN, I SELL
T‐SHIRTS AT CONCERTS...

00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:39,591
YES.
AND I KNOW THAT THE VENUES
BEAT YOU OVER THE HEAD.

00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:43,395
I MEAN, THERE'S KIND OF A LOW
MARGIN ON THAT, ISN'T THERE?

00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:45,464
WELL, IT DEPENDS. I MEAN,
IF IT'S‐‐SOME‐‐SOME EVENTS,

00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:47,699
IT'S $100 TO GET IN.
SOME, IT'S $1,000.

00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:50,602
ARE YOU GONNA MAKE A PROFIT
ON THAT?
YEAH, WELL,
WE'RE CASH FLOW‐POSITIVE,

00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:53,038
ABOUT IT OVER $7,000
FOR THE YEAR.

00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:56,408
WE'VE BEEN PUTTING EVERYTHING
BACK INTO THE BUSINESS.
BUT YOU DON'T
PAY YOURSELVES ANYTHING.

00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:59,211
NO, NOT YET.
SO YOUR BUSINESS MAKES
ABOUT $7,000.

00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:03,549
NOT REALLY. THEY DON'T
PAY THEMSELVES ANYTHING.
SO, SHON, THE‐‐THE $50,000
YOU'RE ASKING FOR,

00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:05,584
WHAT‐‐WHAT WOULD YOU USE
THAT FOR?

00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:07,619
WELL, WE WANNA START ATTENDING
THE TRADE SHOWS

00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:09,621
TO GET IT
IN FRONT OF THE BUYERS

00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:12,691
AND WE WANNA EXPAND OUR
TRADEMARKS INTO OUR COUNTRIES.

00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,093
I MEAN, WE WANNA TAKE OUR PARTY
TO THE TRADE SHOW.

00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:17,796
YOU CAN'T JUST HAVE ONE TABLE
AND TWO GUYS SITTING BEHIND IT,

00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:19,765
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE WHEN
WE SELL THIS STUFF,

00:28:19,765 --> 00:28:22,334
WE GOT THE MUSIC BLASTING,
WE THROW IMPROMPTU CONCERTS.

00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:24,336
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE ARTISTS
COME INTO OUR TENT.

00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:26,338
YOU KNOW,
SO IT IS A HUGE PARTY,

00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:29,441
AND‐‐AND I THINK THAT'S WHY
WE HAVE SUCH A GREAT FOLLOWING.

00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:33,545
NOW YOU'RE ASKING FOR $50,000
FOR 25% OF THE BUSINESS.

00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,348
THAT MEANS YOU'RE VALUATING
YOUR BUSINESS AT $200,000.

00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:39,084
ON $7,000 IN PROFIT.

00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:43,388
NO PROFIT. THERE'S NO PROFIT.
STOP SAYING THAT.
OH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
ON NO PROFIT.

00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,390
WE BASED THAT
ON THE $60,000 IN SALES,

00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,392
2 AND A HALF TIMES EARNINGS,

00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:50,462
PLUS $50,000 VALUE ON
THE 4 TRADEMARKS WE'RE HOLDING.

00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:52,264
I THINK YOU WERE SMART ENOUGH

00:28:52,264 --> 00:28:54,566
TO UNDERSTAND
THE POWER OF THE MARK.

00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,702
THAT RIGHT THERE IS
A GREAT BUSINESS ITSELF.

00:28:56,702 --> 00:29:00,539
SO YOU GONNA WRITE A CHECK?
ARE YOU SELLING SOMETHING?

00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:03,709
THEN MIND YOUR BUSINESS.
WHY NOT LICENSE THIS OUT
TO SOMEBODY...

00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:07,446
(O'Leary) EXACTLY.
AND LET THEM GO AFTER
THE BIG RETAILERS?

00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:10,449
AND‐‐AND YOU REAP
THE BENEFITS.
THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING
THAT WE WANTED TO EXPLORE.

00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:12,451
I MEAN, WE'VE ALREADY SIGNED
A LICENSING DEAL

00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:14,553
WITH A CANADIAN
RECORD COMPANY.

00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:17,623
AND THEY'RE GONNA START
PACKAGING IT WITH THEIR MUSIC

00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:20,592
AND THEIR ARTISTS, AND SELLING
IT IN A HUNDRED HMV STORES,

00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,694
YOU KNOW, COMING UP
IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS.

00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:24,696
(O'Leary) OKAY, HERE'S WHAT
I TAKE FROM THIS.

00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:27,566
NOW YOU'VE COME OUT HERE
AND SAID,

00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:29,534
"LOOK, WE'RE SMART ENOUGH
TO KNOW

00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:30,936
"THAT THE ONLY THING OF VALUE
WE HAVE IS OUR MARK‐‐

00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:32,571
"OUR BRAND HillBilly.

00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:35,240
"WE'RE SO SMART THAT WE'VE GOT
FOUR DEALS TO LICENSE THIS,

00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,944
AND THERE'S A COST TO
SET THAT UP, AND IT'S $50,000."

00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,846
<i>THAT</i> WOULD'VE BEEN INTERESTING
TO ME.

00:29:40,846 --> 00:29:42,681
THAT WOULD'VE BEEN SOMETHING
I WOULD'VE WRITTEN A CHECK FOR.

00:29:42,681 --> 00:29:46,551
I HAVE NO INTEREST
IN COMPETING IN RETAIL‐‐

00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:48,887
A CATEGORY THAT'S SO CROWDED,
GROWN MEN WEEP.

00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:50,889
LICENSING'S NOT OFF‐‐
YOU KNOW, NOT OFF THE TABLE.

00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,724
WE ALREADY DID LICENSING.

00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,293
LOOK, YOU CAN ONLY HAVE ONE
VISION. YOU CAN'T HAVE 15,

00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:56,295
AND LET ME PART OF THE ONES
THAT DON'T WORK.

00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:58,563
I ONLY WANNA BE PART
OF THE ONES WHERE I GET RICH.

00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:00,932
THAT'S ALL I CARE ABOUT.
HillBilly‐‐I GOT IT.

00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:03,535
I THINK IT WORKS.
I MEAN, WE'RE JUST STARTING
ON THE RETAIL SIDE.

00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:05,537
BUT I DON'T WANNA BE IN RETAIL.

00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:07,506
THAT IS THE MOST BRUTAL BUSINESS
ON EARTH.

00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:10,709
YOU'RE ABOUT TO FIND THAT OUT.
I'M OUT.

00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:15,280
♪♪♪

00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:26,191
<i>ONE SHARK IS OUT.</i>

00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:29,194
<i>SHON AND MIKE HAVE FOUR CHANCES</i>
<i>LEFT TO MAKE A DEAL.</i>

00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:31,963
I'M WITH THEM.
YOU GOT GOOD‐LOOKING STUFF.

00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:35,133
YOU LICENSE IT, AND LET SOMEBODY
ELSE GO OUT THERE AND FIND IT.

00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:39,171
(Shon) WE'RE ALL FOR THAT.
WE'RE NOT AGAINST LICENSING.
WHEN WE GO TO THESE EVENTS,

00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:41,173
AND THERE'S TEN OTHER
T‐SHIRT VENDORS

00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:43,342
AND THEN THERE'S THE SINGER'S
TENT, WE OUTSELL ALL OF THEM.

00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:45,344
AND THEY COME TO US SAYING,
"WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:48,280
HOW‐‐HOW ARE YOU DOING THIS?"
WELL, LET ME JUST SAY TO YOU,

00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,283
I WISH I HAD THE LICENSING
CONTACTS TO HELP YOU OUT.

00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:53,218
I THINK THAT IS
THE WAY TO GO, FOR SURE,

00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:56,288
WITH SOMEONE YOU CAN TRUST.
SO I'M OUT

00:30:56,288 --> 00:31:00,225
'CAUSE I JUST DON'T HAVE
THOSE CONTACTS.
SHON, I THINK
THE ULTIMATE REDNECK‐

00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:02,194
IS THAT DISRESPECTFUL, JEFF?

00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:05,731
NO, I‐‐THAT'S A COMPLIMENT.
OKAY, THE ULTIMATE
REDNECK/HILLBILLY

00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:08,400
IS SITTING RIGHT THERE
AT THE END.

00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,669
JEFF, WOULD YOU LICENSE THIS?

00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:19,111
IF YOU CAN GET JEFF TO COME IN
ON THE DEAL, I'LL MAKE AN OFFER.

00:31:19,111 --> 00:31:22,314
BUT I WANT 100% OF THE NAME.
I JUST WANT TO BUY THE NAME

00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:25,150
AND PAY YOU BACK A ROYALTY FEE
ON IT.

00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,319
JEFF, DO YOU WANNA COME IN
ON IT?

00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:31,723
WHAT KIND OF ROYALTY
ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?

00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:35,961
I MEAN, I THINK WE WOULD
PAY THEM BACK A 7% FEE

00:31:35,961 --> 00:31:37,863
ON ANY FUTURE DEALS.

00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:42,134
I JUST WANNA LICENSE IT
FOR OTHER PEOPLE,

00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:45,303
HAVE THE CHECK SHOW UP,
AND YOU GET A FEE OUT OF THAT.

00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:49,441
BUT WE‐‐WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANNA
GIVE UP OUR WHOLE DREAM.

00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:51,309
I MEAN, WE CREATED THIS.
SO...

00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:54,346
I MEAN, WE WOULD LOVE TO PARTNER
WITH YOU OR ANY OF THE SHARKS

00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:58,150
AS‐‐AS LONG AS WE'RE INVOLVED.
WE KNOW HOW TO SELL IT.
IT'S NOT A DREAM
TILL IT MAKES MONEY.

00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:01,686
IT'S JUST A NIGHTMARE
TILL THEN.
I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA
GIVE UP 100% OF OUR COMPANY,

00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:03,955
YOU KNOW, WHEN WE KNOW
HOW TO SELL THIS.

00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:06,291
I MEAN, EVEN THOUGH YOU LICENSE
IT, SOMEONE'S STILL GOTTA GO OUT

00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:08,527
AND SELL IT, YOU KNOW.
JEFF, ARE YOU IN ON IT?

00:32:08,527 --> 00:32:11,163
'CAUSE THAT'S
PRETTY IMPORTANT TO ME.

00:32:11,163 --> 00:32:14,866
YEAH. I‐I'LL GO IN ON THAT
WITH YOU, ROBERT.

00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:19,771
SO YOU'VE GOT THE KING
OF HILLBILLY AND REDNECK

00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:23,208
WILLING TO USE HIS NAME
AND LICENSE IT.

00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:26,144
DAYMOND, YOU WANT IN?

00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:28,713
I THINK THAT IF THE GUYS
GO OUT AND LICENSE IT...

00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:30,649
AHEM, WITH MY EXPERTISE...

00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:33,051
(laughs)
UH, YOU KNOW‐‐

00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:36,655
JEFF, I THINK DAYMOND BRINGS
SOME VALUE.
I THINK DAYMOND BRINGS
A LOT OF VALUE.

00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:38,657
ALL RIGHT, SO LET ME‐‐
LET ME REPHRASE THE DEAL.

00:32:38,657 --> 00:32:40,225
IF YOU DON'T MIND, JEFF.

00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:42,227
GUYS, YOU'RE GONNA GET $50,000

00:32:42,227 --> 00:32:45,063
SPLIT BETWEEN JEFF, DAYMOND,
AND I,

00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:48,900
FOR THE RIGHTS TO THE NAME
IN EXCHANGE FOR A ROYALTY.

00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:53,972
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
I THINK WHAT WE'D LIKE

00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:57,108
IS IF WE COULD GO UP
TO MAYBE $100,000,

00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:59,878
10% INSTEAD OF 7%
ON THE ROYALTIES,

00:32:59,878 --> 00:33:02,481
AND THEN SOME TYPE
OF GUARANTEE

00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:05,250
THAT IF YOU GUYS JUST SAT IT
ON THE SHELF,

00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:08,720
WE'D HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY
TO TAKE IT BACK AT SOME POINT.
YOU'RE NOT HILLBILLIES.

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,189
I'M GONNA DEFER THE ANSWER
TO THAT QUESTION BACK TO JEFF.

00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:13,725
IS IT WORTH THE $100,000?

00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:17,395
MAN, I GOTTA TELL YOU.
EMOTIONALLY, I'M‐‐I'M TORN.

00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:21,466
BECAUSE I WAS YOU 25 YEARS AGO,
GETTIN' UP

00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:24,369
AT 5:00 IN THE MORNING
AND DOING 15 RADIO SHOWS

00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:26,137
DOING REDNECK JOKES,

00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:28,273
TRYING TO DEVELOP THAT BRAND.

00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:29,875
(Daymond) TOUGH ONE.

00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:32,177
I WAS‐‐I WAS THEM AS WELL.
YEAH.

00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:34,779
THEN HAVE A HEART, GUYS,

00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:38,450
AND OPEN YOUR BIG, FAT WALLETS
RIGHT HERE. LET'S GO.
BARBARA, ENOUGH WITH THE...

00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:42,153
I WILL COUNTER WITH $75,000,

00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:43,321
7% ROYALTY.

00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:44,956
$25,000 EACH.

00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:47,692
$25,000 EACH.

00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,160
YOU OKAY WITH THAT?
YEAH.

00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,029
GUYS, $75,000.

00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:55,133
WE GET THE NAME.
YOU GET A 7% ROYALTY.

00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:59,671
THE 10% IS...
OUT OF THE QUESTION?

00:33:59,671 --> 00:34:04,276
I THINK 7% IS GENEROUS.
I THINK YOU GUYS KNOW THAT.
7% IS‐‐IS INDUSTRY STANDARD.

00:34:04,276 --> 00:34:06,811
(Robert and Daymond)
WE NEED AN ANSWER.

00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:08,613
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:11,283
LET'S DEAL?

00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:13,351
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO. DEAL.
(Robert) ALL RIGHT!

00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:14,553
(Jeff) YEEHAW!

00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,354
YEEHAW!
WHOO!

00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,823
(Shon) YOU LIKE THAT, HUH, JEFF?
(Daymond) I'M ALREADY WORRIED
ABOUT YOU GUYS.

00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:21,993
(Robert) COME ON, JEFF.
PUT YOUR HAT ON, GUYS. YEAH!
(Mike) I LIKE THAT.
I LIKE THAT. LOOKS GOOD, MAN.

00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:24,195
(Daymond) ALL RIGHT, MAN.
CONGRATULATIONS.
HEY, JEFF, THANKS.

00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:27,165
(Jeff) THANKS, MAN.
IT COULD WORK.

00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:29,334
(sighs)

00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:31,269
DO OR DIE, MAN. WHEW!

00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:33,271
IT MEANS A LOT TO HAVE A DEAL
WITH FOXWORTHY.

00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:35,273
I MEAN, THAT GUY <i>IS</i> COUNTRY,
YOU KNOW.

00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:37,275
HE LIVES AND BREATHES COUNTRY.

00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:39,878
SO FOR US TO HAVE A LICENSING
DEAL WITH HIM BACKING IT

00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:41,880
IS AMAZING,
AND I THINK THIS IS

00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,882
PROBABLY THE BEST THING
THAT COULD'VE HAPPENED TO US.

HI, MY NAME IS JOHN GENNARO.

00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:13,878
I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU
TO MY ASSOCIATE,

00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:15,513
MR. VINNY PASTORE,

00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:18,416
THE CELEBRITY STAR
OF HBO's SERIES, "SOPRANOS."

00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,986
I CREATED A PRODUCT
CALLED THE BROCCOLI WAD.

00:35:20,986 --> 00:35:22,854
(laughs)

00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:25,490
I'M HERE TODAY LOOKING
FOR AN INVESTMENT OF $50,000,

00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:28,560
AND FOR THAT, I'M WILLING
TO GIVE 20% OF THE COMPANY AWAY.

00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,262
AS THEY SAY, IT'S AN OFFER,
HOPEFULLY, YOU CAN'T REFUSE.

00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:33,865
JOHNNY, LET ME JUST START
BY SAYING,

00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:36,001
IF HE'S PACKING HEAT...
(laughs)

00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:39,404
I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH MONEY
IS INVOLVED, I'M IN.

00:35:39,404 --> 00:35:42,507
NOW MOST GUYS CARRY
THEIR MONEY IN A WALLET.

00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:46,378
BUT WISE GUYS CARRY THEIR MONEY
IN A WAD LIKE THIS.

00:35:46,378 --> 00:35:50,415
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THIS IS THE BROCCOLI WAD.

00:35:50,415 --> 00:35:53,018
(Johnny) THE BROCCOLI WAD
CONCEPT CAME FROM AN IDEA

00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:55,987
OF A BOOK I READ
SEVERAL YEARS AGO.

00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,989
AND IT WAS TALKING ABOUT
AN FBI AGENT

00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,892
WHO INFILTRATED
THE MOB IN NEW YORK.

00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:02,761
AND ONE OF
THE KEY CHARACTERISTICS

00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:05,030
WAS THAT WISE GUYS
NEVER CARRY WALLETS.

00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,931
THEY CARRY THEIR CASH
IN BROCCOLI BANDS,

00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:09,000
NOT EVEN RUBBER BANDS.

00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,002
THE BROCCOLI BAND
IS A PERFECT FIT

00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,838
TO WRAP AROUND CASH
AND AROUND A‐‐

00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:17,409
WHERE DO WISE GUYS
KEEP THEIR CREDIT CARDS?
WISE GUYS
DON'T CARRY CREDIT CARDS.

00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:19,177
JUST CASH?
YEAH, JUST CASH.

00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,813
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE I. D.'d
IF THEY STOP YOU.

00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:24,249
OF COURSE.
THEY DO CARRY A LICENSE,
BUT NORMALLY,

00:36:24,249 --> 00:36:26,851
IT'S FROM OUT OF STATE
AND IT'S EXPIRED.

00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,020
(laughs)
HAVE YOU GOT SOME THERE
THAT WE CAN SEE AS YOU‐‐

00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,757
ACTUALLY, I HAVE ONE
FOR EVERYBODY.
NOW I MET JOHNNY,
AND HE SAYS,

00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:35,927
I CREATED THIS PRODUCT,
THE BROCCOLI WAD.

00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:39,064
SO I THOUGHT HE WAS A LITTLE,
YOU KNOW, OFF HIS ROCKER.

00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:42,367
BUT WHAT I WAS IMPRESSED ABOUT
WITH THIS BROCCOLI WAD

00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:46,004
WAS, I MEAN,
LOOK HOW CUTE IT IS. (laughs)

00:36:46,004 --> 00:36:47,238
(laughs)

00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:50,542
VINNY, DON'T‐‐DON'T BREAK
MY LEGS FOR ASKING THIS...

00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:53,878
OKAY.
BUT‐‐BUT COME ON,
IT‐‐IT'S A PIECE OF RUBBER.

00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,346
RIGHT.

00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:58,883
THAT YOU'RE SAYING IS WORTH
$250,000 AS A COMPANY?

00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,752
WELL, UM,

00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:02,754
HOW MUCH YOU GIVING ME
EVERY TIME WE SELL ONE?

00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:04,389
YOU GET 50 CENTS A UNIT.

00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:07,258
SO IF I GET 50 CENTS
A UNIT...
(sharks laugh)

00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:10,995
AND IF HE SELLS ENOUGH OF 'EM,
I'LL GET MY HOUSE IN MALIBU.

00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:14,099
YOU KNOW, I THINK
YOU'RE BOTH TOTALLY NUTS.

00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:16,401
I DON'T GET IT.

00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:20,505
I AM SO OUT ON THIS.

00:37:20,505 --> 00:37:25,009
WORSE THING
I'VE HEARD ON THIS SHOW.
BARBARA, I WOULDN'T
TALK TO HIM LIKE THAT.

00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:27,846
IT'S ALL RIGHT. THAT'S
ALL RIGHT. SHE'S A SWEETHEART.

00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:29,814
BARBARA, I THINK
IN FAIRNESS TO THE PRODUCT,

00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:31,649
IT'S A DIFFICULT FEMALE ITEM.

00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:34,919
GUYS GET IT 'CAUSE GUYS
HAVE ALWAYS USED RUBBER BANDS.

00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:38,022
AND I WILL SAY THIS, AS A GUY, I
MEAN, I'VE GOTTEN TO THE POINT,

00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:40,692
I‐‐MY WALLET GOT WHERE IT WAS
THE SIZE OF A PHONE BOOK,

00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:43,428
SO I'M ALWAYS LOOKING FOR
SOMETHING TO PUT MY CASH IN.

00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:47,866
RIGHT.
AND MOST OF THE CLIPS
DON'T WORK RIGHT.

00:37:47,866 --> 00:37:49,968
I MEAN, I'M‐‐
I LIKE THIS IDEA.

00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:52,670
JUST EXPLAIN
HOW WE'RE GONNA SELL THESE.

00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,572
FIRST OF ALL,
THE PRODUCT COMES

00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:56,875
WITH FOUR BANDS
AND FOUR METAL SLIDES.

00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:59,010
THIS IS GONNA BE
A $10 TO $14 ITEM.

00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,345
I'VE ALREADY CREATED TWO

00:38:00,345 --> 00:38:03,515
2‐MINUTE SPOTS, UH, ALREADY
WITH VINNY IN IT.

00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:05,850
HE SHOT IT WITH SOME OF
MY "SOPRANO" CAST MEMBERS,

00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,853
AND WE'RE, UH, ABOUT TO DO
THIS WHOLE CAMPAIGN.

00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:12,056
WE ALREADY TALKED, UH,
TO THE CASINOS IN ATLANTIC CITY

00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:14,692
AND VEGAS, WHERE I WILL BE
DOING PERSONAL APPEARANCES,

00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:18,263
AND THE CASINO WILL BE GIVING
THEM OUT TO CASINO PLAYERS.

00:38:18,263 --> 00:38:20,532
HOW MUCH DO YOU HAVE INVESTED
IN THIS COMPANY?

00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:24,035
I ALREADY HAVE
ABOUT $200,000 INTO IT.

00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:25,870
HOW'S THAT POSSIBLE?
(Robert) WOW.

00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,639
'CAUSE HE PAID ME $190,000.

00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,674
(sharks laugh)

00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:32,844
I WANT TO BE VINNY. YOU FIGURED
THIS WHOLE THING OUT.

00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:35,413
NAH, NAH.
HE TOOK CARE OF ME.

00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:37,882
HOW DOES HE TAKE CARE OF YOU?
HE TAKES CARE OF ME.

00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:41,886
(sharks laugh)
I COME FROM A BACKGROUND
OF NOVELTY ITEMS.

00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:43,488
I SEE THIS AS

00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:46,024
AS SEEN ON TV, 2‐MINUTE SPOT,
$9.99 PLUS SHIPPING‐‐

00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:48,026
SO‐‐SO, JOHN,
DO YOU NEED THE 50K

00:38:48,026 --> 00:38:50,328
TO BUY THE AIRTIME
TO FINALLY PUT THIS COMMERCIAL

00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,031
OUT THERE
WHERE PEOPLE CAN SEE IT?
I NEED THE $50,000,

00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:55,066
SOME OF THAT, YES,
TO HELP IN THE TV ITSELF,

00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:57,302
BUT THE REALITY IS,
I'M LOOKING FOR

00:38:57,302 --> 00:38:58,970
THE SALES
AND MARKETING EXPERTISE.

00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:03,241
WHY DON'T I SEE
VINNY'S PICTURE ANYWHERE?

00:39:03,241 --> 00:39:05,844
WHY ISN'T IT CALLED
THE VINNY WAD?
LIKE WHY ISN'T HE‐‐

00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:08,713
IF YOU CALLED IT
THE VINNY WAD‐‐
WHY ISN'T HIS PICTURE ON HERE?

00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:11,816
THE VINNY WAD'S
PROBABLY BETTER, SURE.

00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:14,986
DO YOU SEE VINNY AS‐‐
AS KIND OF THE FACE OF THIS?

00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:17,088
(John) WITHOUT VINNY, THIS IS‐‐
THIS IS A RUBBER BAND.

00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:19,190
YEAH, I'M BACK IN

00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,693
YOU WANT TO DO
THE VINNY WAD?

00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:25,263
YEAH.
THAT'S DIFFERENT.

00:39:25,263 --> 00:39:28,032
YOUR GREATEST ASSET
IS STANDING NEXT TO YOU.

00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,735
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
BUT YOU HAVEN'T
BRANDED HIM ANYWHERE.

00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:33,471
IS HE WITH THIS LONG‐TERM?
COULD BE.

00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:34,839
UH, I THINK,
THEN TRUTHFULLY,

00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:37,308
TO SPEAK HONESTLY
IN FRONT OF JOHNNY WAD,

00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:39,677
THAT IT'S A MATTER
OF ECONOMICS.
HE'S NOT PAYING YOU ENOUGH.

00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:41,646
HE'S NOT
PAYING YOU ENOUGH.

00:39:41,646 --> 00:39:44,849
I THINK THAT SOUNDS
VERY EXPENSIVE. I'M OUT.

00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,818
YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:49,254
THIS JUST ISN'T FOR ME.

00:39:49,254 --> 00:39:51,923
I'M OUT.

00:39:51,923 --> 00:39:56,060
YEAH, I‐I DON'T HAVE
AN OFFER. I'M OUT.

00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,363
I'M GONNA MAKE A DEAL
FOR YOU.

00:39:58,363 --> 00:40:01,532
VINNY, LISTEN TO THIS‐‐

00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:05,069
WE'RE GONNA MAKE AN OFFER,
VINNY AND I...

00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,071
(Robert)
VINNY'S NOT A SHARK.

00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,974
WAIT, WELL‐‐
WHAT, ARE YOU GUYS DATING NOW?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:13,011
THIS IS WHAT I'M GONNA SAY‐‐
40% FOR THE $50,000.

00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:17,315
YOU PUT UP THE FACE
AND THE VINNY WAD NAME,

00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:24,989
WELL, I'M OUT.
THAT'S A GREAT OFFER.

I LOVE YOU.
GIVE ME A SQUEEZE.

00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:33,164
OH. (speaks Italian)
WHAT JUST HAPPENED THERE?

00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:35,500
(Daymond) WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
WHERE DO I GO?

00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,303
BARBARA BOUGHT ME OUT.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
(sharks laugh)

00:40:38,303 --> 00:40:40,705
I DON'T NEED JOHNNY WAD.
JOHN, YOU JUST GOT WHACKED.

00:40:40,705 --> 00:40:43,875
YOU DIDN'T GET WHACKED.
YOU'RE STILL INTO IT FOR 60%.

00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:45,877
I GOT WHAT, 60%?
LET ME JUST SAY IT AGAIN.

00:40:45,877 --> 00:40:48,212
I'M GIVING YOU THE $50,000.
OKAY, YEAH.

00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:50,181
FOR THAT, I GET 40%.
OKAY.

00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:54,085
I'M GONNA GIVE 20%,
OR HALF OF MY 40%, TO VINNY.

00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:56,254
OKAY.
AND VINNY'S GONNA DONATE
HIS FACE

00:40:56,254 --> 00:40:58,923
AND HIS BRAND TO YOUR PRODUCT.

00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:02,994
SO BASICALLY, SHE FUNDED
GETTING HIM INTO THE DEAL

00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:04,829
WITH HIS FACE, AND HE AGREED.

00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:07,999
HE NOW HAS 20% OF THE COMPANY.
SHE HAS 20% OF THE COMPANY.

00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:09,934
YOU'VE GOT $50,000.

00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:11,803
AND YOU STILL
RUN THE BUSINESS.

00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:14,906
HOW MUCH PRODUCT DO YOU HAVE
IN YOUR WAREHOUSE?
50,000 PIECES.

00:41:14,906 --> 00:41:16,874
CAN I SEE THE PACKAGE?

00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:18,509
JUST PUT VINNY'S PICTURE
ON IT.

00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:21,079
YOU NEED A STICKER
WITH VINNY ON IT.
THAT'S IT.

00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:24,215
THAT'S ALL YOU NEED,
RIGHT UP HERE.
BUT HOW ARE WE
GONNA MOVE FORWARD?

00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:26,985
I CAME HERE
NOT JUST FOR MONEY,

00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:29,020
BUT FOR SALES
AND MARKETING EXPERTISE.

00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,888
DO I GET YOUR EXPERTISE?
THE ONLY THING I KNOW
REALLY, REALLY WELL

00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,557
IS SALES AND MARKETING.

00:41:32,557 --> 00:41:34,425
THE MINUTE I THOUGHT OF
THE VINNY CLIP,

00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:37,695
I KNEW THIS WAS A HOME RUN.

00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:40,031
(Robert)
THIS IS ONE TOUGH BROAD.
(Vinny) I LIKE HER.

00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:42,967
BARBARA'S MY STYLE.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE MY STYLE, TOO.

00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:45,003
BARBARA, WHATEVER YOU WANT
TO DO, WE'RE GONNA ROLL.

00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:47,872
WHOA. YOU GUYS GO AHEAD
AND TAKE IT.
NO, WE'RE GONNA MAKE MONEY.

00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:50,008
STOP, JOHNNY. RELAX.
(Barbara)
WAIT A MINUTE. (laughs)

00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:53,878
(sharks laugh)

00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:56,514
DO YOU ACCEPT THE DEAL?

00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:04,055
I'LL ACCEPT IT.
(Barbara and Robert) ALL RIGHT.

00:42:04,055 --> 00:42:06,057
THIS IS‐‐THIS IS
HISTORY IN THE MAKING.

00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:09,260
I GOT TWO MEN FOR THE PRICE
OF ONE. THANK YOU.

00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,829
AND I WANT TO HUG
MY PARTNER. THANKS, GUYS.

00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:13,931
YOU MADE A GREAT DEAL.

00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:16,501
WAS IT A BLUFF, OR YOU SAID,
"THIS IS THE WORST IDEA

00:42:16,501 --> 00:42:19,370
I'VE EVER HEARD
ON 'SHARK TANK,'"

00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,006
AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN,
YOU'RE HUGGING AND KISSING?
NO, I MEANT IT WAS
THE WORST IDEA.

00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:24,175
IT STILL IS,
BUT ONCE YOU MARKET IT,

00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:25,877
IT'S GENIUS.

00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:27,879
I'M REALLY GLAD I MADE
THE DEAL WITH BARBARA. SH‐‐

00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,881
YOU DIDN'T MAKE THE DEAL
WITH BARBARA.

00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:31,883
<i>I</i> MADE THE DEAL WITH BARBARA.
MY PRODUCT, AGAIN, VINNY.
MY‐‐

00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,885
OKAY, WELL, WE
BOTH MADE THE DEAL.

00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:35,887
WE BOTH MADE THE DEAL.
OKAY, GREAT. I'M HAPPY.

00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,889
I THINK SHE'S GOOD.
SHE'S WONDERFUL.

00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,891
I THINK SHE'LL BE GREAT
FOR SALES AND MARKETING,

00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:41,893
WHICH IS WHAT WE NEED.
RIGHT, VINNY'S‐‐
VINNY'S WAD.

00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:43,895
VINNY'S WAD. VINNY'S CLIP.
VINNY'S WHATEVER.

00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:46,330
VINNY'S WAD.
THAT'S FINE.
VINNY'S WAD IT IS.

00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,866
AS LONG AS I SELL
FOUR MILLION.
(laughs) OKAY.
