AND I'M FROM
YELLOW SPRINGS, OHIO.

00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,024
MY PRODUCT IS FridgeFronts,
AND I'M ASKING FOR $100,000

00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,226
IN EXCHANGE FOR
30% OF MY COMPANY.

00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:16,630
I WAS LIVING IN BASE HOUSING
IN 1999,

00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,965
AND WE HAD
A HIDEOUS REFRIGERATOR.

00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,967
YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO HAVE

00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:23,370

00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,605
JAN, UM, JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY,
WHAT'S BASE HOUSING?

00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,107
OH, MILITARY BASE HOUSING.

00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:29,910
I WAS AN AIR FORCE WIFE,
AND I LIVED ON A MILITARY BASE.

00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,679
AND THEY PROVIDE HOUSING
FOR YOU.
AND BAD FRIDGES.

00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,981
YES. SO I CAME UP
WITH THE IDEA

00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:37,551
BECAUSE WE HAD AN APPLIANCE
VERY SIMILAR TO THIS.

00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,353
IN FACT, THIS PROBABLY
COULD'VE BEEN IT.

00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,189
SO MY PRODUCT, FridgeFronts,

00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:44,725
IS A MAGNETIC SKIN
THAT'S A DECORATIVE FINISH,

00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,727
AND YOU CAN EASILY
CUT IT WITH SCISSORS

00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,762
AND APPLY TO ANY APPLIANCE
JUST LIKE THAT.

00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:50,363
IT'S VERY EASY TO DO.

00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:53,734
LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.

00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:01,074
SO IN THIS ECONOMY, YOU MAY
HAVE A FRIDGE THAT WORKS,

00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,411
BUT THAT'S JUST UNATTRACTIVE
AND UNAPPEALING.

00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,114
YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND PURCHASE
THIS FOR UNDER $100,

00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:09,816
AND CHANGE THE COMPLETE LOOK
OF YOUR APPLIANCE.

00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:12,652
I ALSO HAVE OTHER DESIGNS.
MOST PEOPLE LIKE STAINLESS.

00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:16,590
SO I HAVE STAINLESS FINISH.
I CAN DO DECORATIVE FINISHES.

00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,760
ANYTHING‐‐JUST FUNKY.
WE CAN GET CRAZY.

00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,264

ARE COMPLETELY ENDLESS.

00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,933
JAN, DO YOU HAVE ANY SALES?

00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,602
YES. I STARTED IN '05.

00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,604
WE GOT OUR PATENT AT THAT TIME.

00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,706
AND THE FIRST THING WE DID
WAS SkyMall.

00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:35,442
SO I THINK WE DID
$40,000 IN SALES.

00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,145
DID YOU HAVE TO PAY
FOR THAT SPACE IN SkyMall?
YES, I DID.

00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:40,147
YEAH.
IT WAS ABOUT $18,000.

00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:43,416
SO YOU‐‐ON $18,000,
YOU GENERATED $40,000 IN SALES.
MM‐HMM. YES.

00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,019
WAS THAT ABOUT A BREAK EVEN
FOR YOU, GIVE OR TAKE,

00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,789
OR DID YOU MAKE
A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY?
WELL, NO.
WHAT HAD HAPPENED IS,

00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,291
WE WERE SORT OF AT THE MERCY
OF OUR PRINT HOUSE.

00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,261
AND THEY HAD QUOTED
A PRICE FOR US,

00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:56,530
AND WE SIGNED ALL THE PAPERWORK.
THEY CAME BACK

00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,865
A COUPLE MONTHS LATER
BEFORE IT WENT INTO THE CATALOG,

00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:01,768
AND CHARGED US
AN ADDITIONAL $10.
YOU DIDN'T HAVE THAT
IN THE CONTRACT

00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,804
WITH THAT PARTICULAR SUPPLIER?
NO.

00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:07,174
JAN, YOU'RE‐‐YOU'RE
AT THE MERCY OF ONE SUPPLIER?

00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:09,176
WE WERE AT THE TIME, YEAH.

00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:12,646
WE'RE FROM A SMALL TOWN IN OHIO,
WE WERE JUST GETTING STARTED.

00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,648
WE HAD NOT
DONE TRADE SHOWS YET.

00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,817
SINCE THAT TIME,
WE'VE DONE A FEW TRADE SHOWS

00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,318
AND MADE SOME CONNECTIONS.

00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,887
SO WE COULD DO THIS
BY HAVING IT DONE OVERSEAS

00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:24,558
AT A CHEAPER COST.
BESIDES THAT ONE SkyMall TEST,
DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER SALES?

00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:26,459
YES. ACTUALLY, THE OTHER THING
THAT HAPPENED,

00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,563
IN '08, RACHAEL RAY
FOUND US ONLINE.

00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:32,432
THEY WANTED TO RECREATE
A KITCHEN JUST LIKE RACHAEL'S.

00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,568
THEY USED OUR PRODUCT.
I MADE A CUSTOM ONE FOR THEM.

00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:37,170
THEY PUT IT ON AIR. WE DIDN'T
KNOW HOW MUCH SERVER ACTIVITY

00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,172
WE WOULD NEED TO SUPPORT IT.

00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,842
SO WHAT HAPPENED WAS,
OUR SERVERS CRASHED...
OH, GOSH.

00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,744
WE HAD SO MANY HITS.
AFTER YOU GOT HOW MANY ORDERS
DID IT CRASH?

00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:47,614
WELL, THERE'S ANOTHER
LITTLE PROBLEM. (laughs)
OH.

00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:50,183
I HATE TO‐‐I KNOW.
IT'S A LOT OF NEGATIVITY‐‐
OH, MY GOSH.

00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,018
I KNOW.
(Robert) YEAH.

00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,855
BUT WE KEEP GETTING UP
AND TRYING. IT'S LIKE A PHOENIX.

00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,356
SO WHAT HAPPENED THAT TIME

00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,925
IS THE, UM, PRINT COMPANY WE
WERE WORKING WITH WENT BANKRUPT.

00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,994
OUR PRODUCT, WHICH WE'D ALREADY
PAID FOR, WAS STUCK

00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,796
IN THEIR
BANKRUPTCY WAREHOUSE.

00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:06,066
SO WE HAD TO BUY IT BACK, WHICH
HELD US UP, LIKE, TWO MONTHS.

00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:09,469
AND BY THAT TIME,
PEOPLE LOST INTEREST.
JAN,
THERE'S NOTHING PROPRIETARY

00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,972
ABOUT THAT MAGNETIC FILM,
IS THERE?
WE CAN DO‐‐
THIS IS AN ADHESIVE.

00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:15,041
WE CAN DO A FOIL ADHESIVE
TO THE MAGNET.

00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,345
BUT‐‐BUT WHAT IS THE PATENT?
IT'S A UTILITY PATENT
THAT WE DID GET.

00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:20,347
SO YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE

00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:22,949
WHO CAN PUT A STICKER
ON A FRIDGE?

00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,684
MAGNETIC, YES.

00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,686
DO YOU HAVE PRODUCT NOW?
YES.

00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:29,623
YES, I HAVE 1,500 BLANK SHEETS
THAT ARE READY FOR PRINTING.

00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:31,558
AND THEN I HAVE
ABOUT A THOUSAND

00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:34,127
OF OUR OLD PRINTED DESIGNS
IN A WAREHOUSE.
DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU

00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:37,063
WHAT MODEL FRIDGE I HAVE
OR I CAN CUT IT?

00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,266
WE WENT TO
A ONE FILM LIKE THIS,

00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,234

THAT YOU CAN CUT YOURSELF.

00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,137

00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,326
COULD NOT CONTINUE TO PUMP
THE MONEY INTO THE MAGNETS.

00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:08,328
AND SO HE KINDA
GOT BURNED OUT.

00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:11,865
VERY PRAGMATIC, I MUST SAY,
BUT IT'S NOT A COMPANY.

00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:14,634

HOODIA IS AN HERB FROM
SOUTH AFRICA THAT HAS BEEN KNOWN

00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:47,366

OH, YEAH.

HAVE YOU BEEN TO INDIA, APRIL?

00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,333
I HAVE NOT.
I'VE BEEN TO INDIA.

00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:36,301
AND, UH, I'LL TELL YOU THIS‐‐

00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:39,304
IT'S ONE OF THE POOREST
COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD.

00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:41,940
IT WOULD BE
BEYOND SHOCKING TO ME

00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:46,211
THAT A LIP GLOSS
THAT HELPS PEOPLE LOSE WEIGHT

00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,881
WOULD BE A HUGE SELLER THERE.

00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:51,417
I'D BE VERY CAREFUL
WITH A DISTRIBUTOR

00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:54,620
THAT'S TELLING YOU HE'S GONNA
GET YOU TO $1 MILLION IN SALES.

00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,922

HUGE IMPORT DUTIES

00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:01,026
I'M NOT RELYING
ON INDIA TOTALLY

00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:03,328
BECAUSE I HAVE
JUST SIGNED AGREEMENTS

00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:05,998
WITH OTHER DISTRIBUTORS
IN THE UNITED STATES.

00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:09,535
UM, SO I'VE GOT MANY OTHER
THINGS IN THE WORKS AS WELL.
HERE'S THE THING
WITH DISTRIBUTORS‐‐

00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:11,837
EVERYBODY IS A DISTRIBUTOR
IF THEY'LL TAKE YOUR MONEY

00:26:11,837 --> 00:26:13,338
AND TAKE YOUR PRODUCT.

00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:16,075
NOW ARE ANY OF THESE
DISTRIBUTORS OFFERING YOU MONEY

00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,077
AHEAD OF TIME ON SIGNING?

00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:21,346
NO, THEY'RE NOT.

00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:24,817
IF YOU GET BIG, AND I WAS
TO ACTUALLY GIVE YOU $80,000,

00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:27,953
AND WE AGITATED THE GOVERNMENT

00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:30,222
THAT STOPS THIS KIND OF CLAIM,

00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:32,791
IT COULD BE BAD FOR BOTH OF US.

00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:36,261
THEY CAN BE VERY NASTY
WHEN THEY GET PISSED OFF.

00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:39,498
ISN'T THAT SOMETHING
THAT'S ON YOUR MIND?
OF COURSE IT'S ON MY MIND.

00:26:39,498 --> 00:26:41,567
MY INTENTION IS TO WORK

WITHIN THE GUIDELINES,

00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:45,704

THINgloss SELLS FOR $28.

00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:50,409
WOW. WOW.
(Robert) $28 FOR THIS?

00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:52,845
(April) YES.
IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE.

00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:55,347
HOW MUCH IS NORMAL LIP GLOSS
FOR A WOMAN?
$8.

00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,749
YOU CAN GET AN $8 LIP GLOSS
PROBABLY AT A DRUG STORE.

00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:59,785
BUT WHEN YOU GO
INTO A DEPARTMENT STORE,

00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:04,556
YOU CAN FIND LIP GLOSSES
ANYWHERE FROM $18 UP TO $40.

00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:08,861
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST YOU
PER CAPSULE OR TUBE?

00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:10,662
BETWEEN $4 AND $5.

00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:12,798
