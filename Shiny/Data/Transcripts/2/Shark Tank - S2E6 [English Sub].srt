00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:18,986

00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:34,635

00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,713
♪♪♪

00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,089
HEY.
MY NAME IS DEIDREA HAYSEL.

00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:06,093
MY COMPANY IS HOT MAMA GOWNS,
AND I'M SEEKING $30,000

00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:09,062
IN EXCHANGE FOR 20% EQUITY
IN MY COMPANY.

00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:12,232
FOUR YEARS AGO, WHEN I GAVE
BIRTH TO MY FIRST CHILD,

00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:15,002
IT SHOULD'VE BEEN THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL DAY OF MY LIFE,

00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:17,070
BUT INSTEAD,
I HAVE TERRIBLE MEMORIES

00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,040
OF FEELING HUMILIATED
AND INSECURE,

00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,643
ALL BECAUSE I WAS WEARING
A NASTY, CHEMICAL‐SMELLING,

00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:26,279
ILL‐FITTING HOSPITAL GOWN
THAT LEFT MY BODY EXPOSED.

00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:29,116
I ACTUALLY HAD TO WEAR
TWO GOWNS‐‐ONE IN THE FRONT,

00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:31,818
ONE IN THE BACK‐‐TO SOMEWHAT
COVER MY BACKSIDE.

00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,554
I SWORE ON THAT DAY
FOUR YEARS AGO,

00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:37,557
THAT NO WOMAN SHOULD EVER HAVE
TO FEEL HUMILIATED LIKE I DID

00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,559
ON SUCH A JOYOUS DAY
IN HER LIFE,

00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:42,396
SO I DESIGNED HOT MAMA GOWNS.

00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:44,831
THEY'RE MADE OF 100% ORGANIC
COTTON, THEY'RE SUPER SOFT,

00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,468
THEY HAVE SHORT SLEEVES FOR
I. V. s AND BLOOD PRESSURE CHECKS,

00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,637
THEY HAVE A FULL SNAP‐DOWN BACK

00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,773
TO KEEP MOM'S ASSETS COVERED,

00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:56,109
AND THEY'RE DESIGNED
FOR BREAST‐FEEDING.

00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:58,779
HOT MAMA GOWNS ALLOW MOM

00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:01,548
TO FEEL BEAUTIFUL, CELEBRATED,
AND CONFIDENT.

00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,550
SHE IS NOT
AN ILL HOSPITAL PATIENT.

00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,319
SHE IS A BEAUTIFUL,
PREGNANT MOTHER,

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,822
AND WHAT SHE'S WEARING
SHOULD REFLECT THAT JOY,

00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:11,558
AND THAT'S PRECISELY WHY
I DESIGNED HOT MAMA GOWNS.

00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:14,161
NOW GIVE ME YOUR MONEY, OKAY?
(chuckles)

00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:17,831
WHO CARES HOW YOU LOOK?
YOU JUST HAD A BABY. IT'S‐‐
IT'S NOT ABOUT HOW I LOOK.
IT'S‐‐IT'S ABOUT ME

00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,833
AND BEING HUMILIATED
AMONG THESE TOTAL STRANGERS.

00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,102
HOW MANY, UH, WOMEN
HAVE A BABY EVERY YEAR?

00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:24,104
THIS IS WHY IT'S SO EXCITING.

00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:27,507
IT'S A $4.5 BILLION MARKET‐‐
MATERNITY.

00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:31,945
IT HAS EXPERIENCED 12% GROWTH
EVERY YEAR SINCE 2002.

00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:34,948
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
$11,500.

00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:37,217
OVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME?

00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,619
THAT'S FROM 2009
TO CURRENTLY.

00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:43,924
NOW YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ASKING
FOR $30,000 FOR 20%,

00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:49,062
YOU'RE BASICALLY SAYING YOUR
COMPANY IS WORTH $150,000?
ABSOLUTELY.
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,365
I'M NOT STANDING IN FRONT OF YOU
WITH A SILVER SPOON IN MY MOUTH.

00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,401
I'VE BEEN WORKING
SINCE I WAS 13 YEARS OLD.

00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,738
I HAVE A FULL‐TIME JOB
WHILE I'M DOING THIS AT NIGHT,

00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:01,041
AFTER THE KIDS GO TO BED, AFTER
I WORK MY 40‐HOUR A WEEK JOB.
WE VALUATE COMPANIES

00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:04,611
ACCORDINGLY
TO HOW MUCH SALES YOU HAVE.
THERE'S NO DEBT
ON THIS COMPANY.

00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:07,581
I HAVE NO LOANS.
I'VE NEVER BORROWED MONEY.

00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,583
EVERYTHING IS PAID FOR.
I'M SITTING ON ABOUT

00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,618
$20,000 OF FABRIC,
ALL THE CUSTOM‐MADE BOXES,

00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:14,688
ALL THE BLANKETS ARE MADE SO‐‐
DEIDREA, WHAT DO YOU DO
FOR A REAL JOB?

00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:17,491
I SELL DRUGS FOR A LIVING‐‐
THE LEGAL ONES.

00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:21,294
I'M A PHARMACEUTICAL SALES REP.
I BET YOU DO
A GOOD JOB DOING THAT.

00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:24,464
THANKS.
UM, I LIKE THIS DEAL,
I LIKE THE ENTHUSIASM,

00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:27,134
BUT THOSE ARE BASIC INGREDIENTS
FOR ANY SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS.

00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:31,004
LET'S FOCUS
ON HOW THIS BUSINESS GROWS.

00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:34,474
AND I SAY TO YOU,
GET ME 10% OF THAT MARKET

00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:38,678
OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS.
HOW YOU GONNA DO THAT?
EASY. THIS IS M‐‐
THIS IS NO ADVERTISING.

00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,680
NO ADVERTISING.
I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING.

00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,216
PEOPLE ARE COMING TO ME.
I HAVE RETAILERS CALLING ME,

00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,919
WANTING TO CARRY MY GOWNS.
OH, REALLY?

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,022
ABSOLUTELY.
DEIDREA, YOU DIDN'T GIVE US
YOUR PRICE ON THIS.

00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,091
MY PRICE POINT IS
A LITTLE BIT TOO HIGH.

00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:54,060
WHY? BECAUSE I'M MANUFACTURING
IN SMALL QUANTITIES.

00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,496
RETAIL PRICE‐‐THEY'RE $119.
AND KEEP IN MIND‐‐
$119?

00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,131
YES, MA'AM.

00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,567
AND WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE IT, INCLUDING THE BOX?

00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:03,003
UM, EVERYTHING ALL TOLD,
IT'S $49.

00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:08,775
I JUST CAN'T GET OVER THIS‐‐
THE AMOUNT OF SALES.

00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:12,412
YOU'RE ONLY DOING
$11,000 A YEAR IN SALES.
BUT IT'S JUST ME. THIS IS
ME WORKING A FULL‐TIME JOB.

00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:15,115
I'D BE DANGEROUS IF I WAS
DOING THIS FULL‐TIME.

00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:17,784
LET'S MAKE NO JOKE ABOUT THAT.
I'M NOT KIDDING.
YOU'RE SCARING ME NOW.

00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,387
THIS IS ME FROM 10:00 AT NIGHT
TILL 2:00 IN THE MORNING

00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:22,389
EVERY SINGLE NIGHT.
IS THIS TRUE?

00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:25,292
WE HAVE A FIRECRACKER
SALES LADY. WE GOT A GREAT IDEA.

00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:28,361
WHAT WE DON'T HAVE IS ANY
DISTRIBUTION. NOW WE GOT MR.‐‐
THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE FOR!

00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,764
NOW WAIT A SECOND.
WE GOT A MR. CLOTHING GUY HERE.

00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:34,401
WHAT'S THE STORY ON THIS,
DAYMOND?
WELL, HERE'S‐‐
HERE'S THE CHALLENGE‐‐

00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:37,571
HOW DO YOU EDUCATE THE ENTIRE
COUNTRY THAT THIS EXISTS?
PREGNANCY'S NOT A TREND.

00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:39,573
IT'S NOT A FAD.
IT'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:42,609
SO YOU'RE LOOKING
AT A $4.5 BILLION MARKET.

00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:45,579
SO YOU'RE GETTING IN NOW
WITH A BRANDED PRODUCT

00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:49,115
THAT PEOPLE KNOW, RESPECT,
AND THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING‐‐
THEY DON'T KNOW
AND RESPECT IT.

00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:52,519
NOBODY KNOWS WHO YOU ARE,
DEIDREA.
HOW DO YOU KNOW? THEY DO.

00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,255
YOU'RE DOING $11,000 A YEAR
IN SALES.
THIS IS BRAND‐NEW.

00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:58,258
YOU'RE ASKING FOR 30K,
AND THAT WILL NOT EVEN GET YOU

00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:02,796
PAST JUST PAYING YOURSELF.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT GETS ME
PAST. I NEED MORE INVENTORY.

00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:04,798
SO THE NEXT TIME I GO
TO MY MANUFACTURER,

00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:07,367
I'M GOING WITH BIGGER NUMBERS,
'CAUSE NOW I HAVE MONEY,

00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,402
INSTEAD OF GOING "HERE'S
MY COUPLE THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:12,339
FOR A HUNDRED GOWNS."
BUT THERE'S SO MANY OTHER THINGS
NOT ADDRESSED.

00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:15,342
BRING IT UP!
DEIDREA, YOU'RE‐‐YOU'RE
A FANTASTIC SALES REP,

00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:18,178
BUT I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT'S MISSING WITH YOU.
THANK YOU. BRING IT.

00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:21,014
YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING HOW YOU'RE
GONNA GROW, HOW YOU'RE

00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:24,050
GONNA ADVERTISE‐‐YOU DON'T KNOW
ANY OF THOSE COSTS.
OF COURSE I DO.

00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,654
WELL, DEIDREA, HOW COULD YOU?
HOW COULD $30,000 PUT YOU

00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:30,924
INTO ANY KIND OF A BRANDING/
ADVERTISING/MARKETING PROGRAM

00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,492
ON A NATIONAL SCALE?

00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:35,595
YOU KNOW,
LET ME TAKE A SHOT AT THIS.

00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:38,398
I LIKE TO BRING CLARITY
TO THESE SITUATIONS.
(chuckles) BRING IT.

00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,400
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,035
WITH THIS BUSINESS IS

00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:45,505
ACTUALLY GETTING THE PRODUCT
TO THE CUSTOMER.
IT'S NOT, THOUGH.

00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:47,507
EXCUSE ME. IN MY MIND,
AS AN INVESTOR,

00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,943
YOU HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED THE COST
OF CUSTOMER ACQUISITION,

00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:51,945
WHICH I BET IS BRUTAL.

00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:54,481
EVERYBODY'S BEEN ASKING YOU,
PARTICULARLY ME,

00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:57,083
WHAT DOES IT COST ME
TO GROW THE BUSINESS?

00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,120
YOU CAN'T ANSWER THAT.
I'M N‐‐I'M NOT SURE
WHAT YOU WANT FROM ME,

00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,423
BECAUSE I‐I HAVE ALL
THE ANSWERS. THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,993
THIS IS NEW. IT'S NOT LIKE I'VE
BEEN DOING THIS FOR FIVE YEARS.

00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:09,996
IT'S A NEW IDEA.
WE'RE EDUCATING THE CUSTOMER.
RIGHT THERE‐‐
YOU'VE IDENTIFIED IT.

00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,998
IT'S NOT A BUSINESS YET.
IT'S AN IDEA.

00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,834
AND MAYBE IT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA,
BUT BETWEEN AN IDEA

00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,837
AND A BUSINESS IS
ONE HELL OF A LONG ROAD.
I DON'T AGREE.

00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:20,473
I DON'T WANT TO TAKE THAT ROAD.

00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:23,510
I DON'T WANT TO RIDE THAT ROAD
WITH YOU. I'M SORRY.
IT'S A GOOD ROAD.

00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,146
(O'Leary) IT'S A LONG ROAD.
I'M OUT.

00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:30,750
IS THERE NO WAY TO MAKE
THIS GOWN ONE SIZE FITS ALL?
THERE'S ACTUALLY
A GREAT POINT IN THAT.

00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,953
THIS ISN'T A THROWAWAY GOWN
THAT YOU GO,

00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,822
OH, I'M GIVE BIRTH INTO IT
AND THROW AWAY.

00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:39,292
IT FITS A WOMAN BEFORE,
DURING, AND AFTER.
WOULD YOU BE OPEN TO THE IDEA
OF MAKING A ONE SIZE FITS ALL?

00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,295
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE BENEFIT
OF THAT WOULD BE.

00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,332
JUST FOR PRICE REASONS,
YOU WOULD SAY, TO GO ONE SIZE?
FOR PRICE REASONS, IT WOULD
MAKE AN ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE.

00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:47,400
I'D HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT,
BECAUSE TO ME,

00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,369
WHEN I THINK
"ONE SIZE FITS ALL,"

00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:51,571
I THINK OF THE GOWN
THAT HER BOTTOM'S EXPOSED.

00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,573
BECAUSE LIKE I SAID,
I'M SERVICING WOMEN

00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:56,576
THAT ARE 2 TO 24, AND A 24‐SIZE
WOMAN‐‐THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,078
HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED

00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:00,981
LICENSING THIS IDEA
TO THE GOWN COMPANIES?

00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,049
I DIDN'T THINK
THAT IT WOULD BE WORTH IT,

00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:05,585
BECAUSE THEY'RE LITERALLY
DOING THEM FOR 25 CENTS A GOWN,

00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:09,289
AND THEY'RE NOT GONNA SEE‐‐THEY
WANT A ONE‐SIZE‐FITS‐ALL GOWN.
HERE'S THE ISSUE‐‐YOU KNOW,

00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:11,291
IT'S WHAT YOU THINK
THAT YOU ALREADY KNOW

00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:14,894
THAT WILL PREVENT YOU
FROM LEARNING.
IT'S TOO HIGH‐END.

00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,263
I UNDERSTAND.
BUT YOU HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS,

00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:20,834
SO YOU'LL NEVER LEARN FROM ME.
SO WITH THAT, I'M OUT.

00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:25,238
THE PROBLEM I HAVE‐‐YOU WANT
YOUR CAKE AND EAT IT, TOO,

00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:28,008
BECAUSE YOU'RE PART‐TIME,
BUT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ME

00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:31,711
TO PUT MY FULL‐TIME MONEY
INTO THIS DEAL.
I'M NOT, THOUGH.
IT'LL MAKE ME FULL‐TIME.

00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:34,681
LIKE I SAID, I'M AMAZING. LIKE
I SAID, I COULD BE DANGEROUS...

00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:37,450
AND SO HUMBLE.
IF I DO THIS. I'M A HOT MAMA.
I'M A HOT‐‐YEAH, SUPER WIFE.

00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,486
MY HUSBAND'S GONE
MONDAY TO FRIDAY,

00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:42,522
SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT SOMEBODY
THAT DOES EVERYTHING WITH

00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,859
A 4 YEAR OLD AND 2 YEAR OLD,
WORKS A 40‐HOUR A WEEK JOB,

00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:49,596
AND HUSTLES HER SIDE BUSINESS.
YOU CAN'T TAKE "NO" AS AN ANSWER
WHICH IS GREAT AS A SALES REP,

00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:53,133
BUT YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING ANY
OF THE INVESTMENT QUESTIONS.

00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,568
YOU'RE TOO SMALL.
LOOK AT YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR

00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:58,571
AND MATURE TO A POINT WHERE
YOU CAN BE A BUSINESS OWNER,

00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:02,175
NOT JUST A GREAT SALES REP.
I'M OUT.
(whispers) THANKS, ROBERT.

00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:04,344
DEIDREA?
(normal voice) YES.

00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:07,814
I HAVE TO SAY, I CAN'T GET OVER
THE PART‐TIME SITUATION.
THIS IS ALWAYS
GONNA BE MY HUSTLE.

00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:10,183
I'M GONNA SAY I'M OUT.

00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:13,119
SO IT'S‐‐IT'S BAD
THAT I HAVE A JOB?

00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:16,356
IS THAT‐‐IS THAT WHAT IT IS?
THE BUSINESS IS NOT
GENERATING ENOUGH

00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:18,858
FOR YOU TO PAY
FULL‐TIME ATTENTION,

00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:22,128
SO WHY SHOULD HIS MONEY
PAY FULL‐TIME ATTENTION?
YEAH. IT'S TOO RISKY FOR ME.

I HAVE NO DOUBT IN MY MIND.

00:13:28,827 --> 00:13:31,830

SHE WANTED TO DO WITH THE BRAND.

00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,528
BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE.

00:16:50,528 --> 00:16:52,897
NO, THAT'S RIGHT.
THERE IS MORE.

00:16:52,897 --> 00:16:56,067
WE'VE MADE THE VERY FIRST EVER
"SHARK TANK" VERSION

00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:57,602
OF THE PAR‐6.

00:16:57,602 --> 00:17:01,539
BEN, ARE THERE GOLF COURSES
THAT HAVE ANY RULES

00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:04,175
ABOUT BEING ABLE
TO BRING YOUR OWN BEVERAGES?

00:17:04,175 --> 00:17:06,277
THERE ARE SOME COURSES
THAT, YOU KNOW,

00:17:06,277 --> 00:17:08,913
FROWN UPON YOU BRINGING
YOUR OWN ONTO THE COURSE,

00:17:08,913 --> 00:17:10,915
BUT THERE'S ALSO A LOT
OF GOLF COURSES OUT THERE

00:17:10,915 --> 00:17:12,250
THAT DON'T PROVIDE

00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,586
ANY TYPE OF BEVERAGE SERVICE
AT ALL WHATSOEVER.

00:17:14,586 --> 00:17:18,156
INTERESTING IDEA.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES RIGHT NOW?

00:17:18,156 --> 00:17:21,759
WE'RE AVERAGING
$15,000 IN SALES A YEAR

00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:25,597
SINCE WE'VE STARTED SO FAR,
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT

00:17:25,597 --> 00:17:27,966
THAT THAT'S
BY WORD OF MOUTH ONLY.

00:17:27,966 --> 00:17:31,436
WE HAVE NOT INVESTED ANY MONEY
INTO ADVERTISING AT THIS TIME.

00:17:31,436 --> 00:17:33,938
JUST SO THAT I DON'T CLUTTER
THE SPACE

00:17:33,938 --> 00:17:37,208
WITH EVERYBODY ELSE WHO ARE
GOLF AFICIONADOS, I'M OUT.

00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:41,279
I PLAY A LOT OF GOLF. THERE IS
NO GOLF COURSE OUT THERE

00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:45,483
THAT'LL ALLOW YOU TO BRING YOUR
OWN BEVERAGE IN. YOU KNOW THAT.

00:17:45,483 --> 00:17:48,486
I DISAGREE.
BUT YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S
CONSUMERS THAT ARE

00:17:48,486 --> 00:17:51,456
CARRYING THEIR BEVERAGES
ON THE COURSE ALREADY.
AGREED. AND THEY USE‐‐
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE

00:17:51,456 --> 00:17:54,092
BETWEEN THAT CONSUMER
SIMPLY TAKING A SMALL COOLER

00:17:54,092 --> 00:17:56,394
AND PUTTING IT
IN THE BACK OF THE GOLF CART?

00:17:56,394 --> 00:17:58,529
WELL, BECAUSE THEN YOU'RE
ADVERTISING THAT YOU HAVE

00:17:58,529 --> 00:18:00,531
YOUR OWN BEVERAGES
ON THE‐‐ON THE GOLF CART.

00:18:00,531 --> 00:18:02,900
WE'LL SHOW YOU WHAT OUR
CURRENT COMPETITION LOOKS LIKE,

00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,036
AND THIS IS WHAT IT IS.
LIKE THIS.

00:18:05,036 --> 00:18:09,073
AND IT'S A MESS. IT DOESN'T
STAY COLD FOR 18 HOLES.

00:18:09,073 --> 00:18:11,743
IT LEAKS INSIDE THE‐‐INSIDE
THE POCKET OF YOUR GOLF BAG.

00:18:11,743 --> 00:18:16,047
THIS WILL NOT DO THAT.
BEN, IF I GAVE YOU THE $60,000,
WHAT WOULD YOU USE IT FOR?

00:18:16,047 --> 00:18:18,750
WE WOULD ORDER 10,000 UNITS
AT $3 APIECE.

00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,818
WE'D TAKE THE REMAINDER
OF THE MONEY,

00:18:20,818 --> 00:18:23,121
AND WE WOULD LOOK AT PUTTING
AN ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN

00:18:23,121 --> 00:18:24,856
TOGETHER IN TARGETED MARKETS,

00:18:24,856 --> 00:18:27,458
TO BE ABLE
TO TURN THE PRODUCT OVER.

00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:30,328
WE'RE SELLING 'EM RIGHT NOW
FOR 2 FOR $19.99.

00:18:30,328 --> 00:18:34,465
THAT'S A PROFIT MARGIN
OF $13.99.

00:18:34,465 --> 00:18:38,636
NOW I'M NO MATH MAJOR,
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE AT $13.99,

00:18:38,636 --> 00:18:42,507
YOU ONLY HAVE TO GET 71,500
ORDERS TO GROSS $1 MILLION.

00:18:42,507 --> 00:18:46,344
THERE'S OVER 36 MILLION GOLFERS
IN THE UNITED STATES ALONE.

00:18:46,344 --> 00:18:50,081
BEN, I'M NO MATH MAJOR EITHER,
BUT $15,000 IN SALES PER YEAR

00:18:50,081 --> 00:18:52,083
IS PRETTY CLOSE TO ZERO.

00:18:53,851 --> 00:18:56,654
IT'S BASICALLY A COOLER BAG,
AND THERE'S A HUGE MARKET

00:18:56,654 --> 00:19:00,458
OF DEVICES
THAT COOL ALL KINDS OF THINGS.
(Robert) YEAH.

00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:03,695
MY KIDS HAVE COOLERS LIKE THIS
WITH EXACTLY THE SAME THING,

00:19:03,695 --> 00:19:05,196
IN DIFFERENT SHAPES.

00:19:05,196 --> 00:19:08,199
LIKE, I THINK IF SOMEONE IS
REALLY MOTIVATED TO BRING

00:19:08,199 --> 00:19:11,569
BEVERAGES ONTO THE GOLF COURSE,
THEY REALLY DON'T NEED YOUR BAG.

00:19:11,569 --> 00:19:14,405
THERE'S A MILLION DIFFERENT USES
THAT YOU CAN USE THIS FOR.

00:19:14,405 --> 00:19:17,208
YOU GOTTA REMEMBER
THE PROMOTIONAL MARKET AS WELL.
WHAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT IT?

00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:20,378
WHAT'S PATENTABLE? WHAT'S‐‐
WHAT MAKES THIS COOLER BETTER

00:19:20,378 --> 00:19:23,948
THAN THE THOUSAND OTHER COOLERS
MY WIFE AND KIDS BUY?

00:19:23,948 --> 00:19:26,117
ONE, WE'VE‐‐WE'VE CHANGED
THE CORNER ON IT

00:19:26,117 --> 00:19:29,187
WHERE THE ZIPPER ATTACHES
TO THE COOLER ITSELF,

00:19:29,187 --> 00:19:32,156
TO PREVENT ANY LEAKING
IF YOU WERE TO USE IT FOR ICE,

00:19:32,156 --> 00:19:34,625
AND THAT IS WHAT DOES
MAKE IT PATENTABLE.

00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:37,795
BUT THERE ARE COOLERS THAT
DON'T NEED ICE. YOU KNOW THAT.
ABSOLUTELY.
BUT THEY'RE NOT SHAPED

00:19:37,795 --> 00:19:41,599
IN THIS‐‐THEY'RE NOT SHAPED
IN THIS FASHION.
SO AGAIN, THE‐‐THE ONLY THING

00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:44,669
THAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT THIS IS
THE SHAPE OF THE COOLER?

00:19:44,669 --> 00:19:47,004
AND THE CORNER, AS HE JUST
EXPLAINED‐‐IT DOESN'T LEAK ICE.

00:19:47,004 --> 00:19:50,007
AND THE FUNCTIONALITY. IT FITS
IN EVERY SINGLE GOLF BAG,

00:19:50,007 --> 00:19:52,510
OR YOUR MONEY BACK.
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE

00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:55,813
THE BEST PLACE TO ADVERTISE THIS
IS THE GOLF CHANNEL?
ABSOLUTELY.

00:19:55,813 --> 00:19:58,716
OKAY, THEN I'M GONNA TELL YOU
RIGHT NOW, ON THE GOLF CHANNEL,

00:19:58,716 --> 00:20:01,619
MOST PRODUCTS ARE GONNA GIVE YOU
A LOWER SCORE.

00:20:01,619 --> 00:20:04,622
RIGHT.
OKAY? THIS IS A PRODUCT THAT'S
KIND OF A FRIVOLOUS‐TYPE PRODUCT

00:20:04,622 --> 00:20:09,026
THAT IT, YOU KNOW, IT, TO ME, IT
DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH PUNCH TO IT

00:20:09,026 --> 00:20:11,996
TO REALLY GET THE PHONE
TO RING.

00:20:11,996 --> 00:20:14,132
SO I'M OUT.

00:20:17,268 --> 00:20:19,604
(Robert) I THINK
IT'S A TRIVIAL PRODUCT.

00:20:19,604 --> 00:20:22,540
I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE GONNA SELL VERY MANY.

00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:26,110
I THINK YOU HAVE
AN UPHILL BATTLE.
IT SOLVES A NEED...

00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:29,113
YEAH.
IT PAYS FOR ITSELF
THE FIRST TIME YOU USE IT,

00:20:29,113 --> 00:20:32,417
AND IT SAVES GOLFERS MONEY
EVERY TIME MOVING FORWARD.
I'M OUT.

00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:35,086
I THINK THERE IS A NEED
FOR THE PRODUCT.

00:20:35,086 --> 00:20:37,855
I HAVE TWO BROTHERS,
BOTH ROOFERS,

00:20:37,855 --> 00:20:40,725
THAT CONSISTENTLY SNEAK BEER
ONTO THE GOLF COURSE,

00:20:40,725 --> 00:20:43,161
AND THEY PROBABLY NEED
FOUR OR FIVE OF THESE

00:20:43,161 --> 00:20:45,596
'CAUSE THEY DRINK A TON.
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

00:20:45,596 --> 00:20:49,000
(Melissa) RIGHT.
BUT IT'S STILL A SMALL BUSINESS.
IT'S NOT THE KIND OF BUSINESS

00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,636
THAT YOU GET AN INVESTOR
TO PUT THEIR MONEY IN,

00:20:51,636 --> 00:20:54,639
'CAUSE YOU JUST COULDN'T GET
THE MONEY BACK OUT.

00:20:54,639 --> 00:20:57,475
IT WOULD TAKE TOO DARN LONG.
SO I'M OUT.

00:20:57,475 --> 00:20:59,510
YOU'RE MAKING SOMETHING

00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:02,780
THAT ALREADY EXISTS ALREADY IN
A THOUSAND DIFFERENT ITERATIONS.

00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,316
THERE'S NOTHING TO INVEST IN.
AND I'M VERY DEPRESSED NOW,

00:21:05,316 --> 00:21:07,952
BECAUSE I KNOW WITH CERTAINTY
THERE'S NO CHANCE

00:21:07,952 --> 00:21:10,922
THAT I CAN EVER MAKE ANY MONEY
WITH YOU.
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION‐‐
WHEN YOU GO OUT

00:21:10,922 --> 00:21:14,592
ON THE GOLF COURSE, DO YOU WANNA
PAY $6 FOR A‐‐FOR ONE COLD BEER

00:21:14,592 --> 00:21:17,094
OR DO YOU WANT TO BE ABLE
TO GET A SIX‐PACK?

00:21:17,094 --> 00:21:19,997
(laughs)
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.
I MEAN, HEY, L‐LET'S FACE IT‐‐
THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE

00:21:19,997 --> 00:21:23,134
THE MOST MONEY ARE THE ONES THAT
ARE WATCHING THE BOTTOM DOLLAR.

00:21:23,134 --> 00:21:25,703
THEY'RE THE ONES THAT DO NOT
WANT TO SPEND THE MONEY

00:21:25,703 --> 00:21:28,739
THAT'S OUT ON THE GOLF COURSE‐‐
BEN, SERIOUSLY, YOU THINK
YOU'RE GONNA CREATE

00:21:28,739 --> 00:21:30,875
A MULTIMILLION DOLLAR BUSINESS
BY SAVING PEOPLE

00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:33,845
A COUPLE OF BUCKS ON A BEER
WHEN THEY GO GOLFING?
I THINK THAT WE CAN SELL

00:21:33,845 --> 00:21:35,847
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF THESE‐‐OF THESE UNITS

00:21:35,847 --> 00:21:40,351
AND MAKE MONEY ON IT AND MAKE
MONEY FOR YOU GUYS AS WELL.
I'M OUT.

00:21:40,351 --> 00:21:42,353
WELL,
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

00:21:42,353 --> 00:21:45,256

SINCE YOU DON'T WANT 'EM?

AN ABSOLUTE HORRIFIC IDEA.

HE TOOK AWAY MY COOLER.

IN THE CAKE BUSINESS?

00:25:30,012 --> 00:25:32,615
WELL, HONESTLY, IT IS‐‐IT IS
MY GOD‐GIVEN TALENT

00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:35,451
FROM HAVING, UM, DONE CATERING
AND TAUGHT COOKING CLASSES.

00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:39,322
SO I DECIDED TO JUST START
THE COMPANY, AND...
SO, KIM,

00:25:39,322 --> 00:25:43,092
THE CAKES ARE FANTASTIC.
BEST CAKES I'VE TASTED. UH...
(Barbara) BEST CAKE
I'VE EVER HAD, REALLY.

00:25:43,092 --> 00:25:46,228
(Robert) YEAH.
THANK YOU.

00:25:46,228 --> 00:25:50,132
HEY, KIM, BUT HOW DO YOU‐‐
HOW DO YOU GET THE CUSTOMERS?
WELL, THE BEST WAY TO GET
THE CUSTOMERS IS TO GO

00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:53,636
TO THE SHOWS. YOU HAVE A BOOTH,
AND THEY GET TO COME BY.

00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:56,639
MY MOTHER CUTS EVERY ONE OF THEM
INTO THESE LITTLE TINY SQUARES

00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:59,642
SO THAT YOU COME BY AND YOU GET
TO HAVE IT ON A TOOTHPICK.
WHAT TYPE OF SHOW
ARE YOU SPEAKING ABOUT?

00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:02,712
OH, LIKE JUNIOR LEAGUE SHOWS.
THEIR HOLIDAY SHOWS.

00:26:02,712 --> 00:26:05,247
LIKE FOR LITTLE COMMUNITIES?
(Daymond) SO THIS IS
TO GET DISTRIBUTORS?

00:26:05,247 --> 00:26:07,249
UM, OH, NO. NOT, UH‐‐MNH‐MNH.
NOT A WHOLESALE.

00:26:07,249 --> 00:26:10,052
THIS IS, UM, LIKE FUND‐RAISERS,
LIKE JUNIOR LEAGUE.

00:26:10,052 --> 00:26:13,889
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
WE JUST FINISHED OUR FIRST YEAR,
AND OUR SALES HAVE BEEN GREAT

00:26:13,889 --> 00:26:17,159
WITH PEOPLE IN THE SOUTH,
WHERE WE'VE GONE.
WE NEED A NUMBER, KIM.

00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:20,162
HOW MUCH HAVE
YOUR SALES BEEN?
UM, THE THREE MONTHS
OF OCTOBER, NOVEMBER,

00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:22,898
AND DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR‐‐
$27‐‐$27,000.

00:26:22,898 --> 00:26:25,468
A LITTLE OVER $27,000.
IN 3 MONTHS?

00:26:25,468 --> 00:26:28,738
IN THREE MONTHS, YES.
AND HOW MANY SHOWS DID
YOU AND YOUR MOM ATTEND

00:26:28,738 --> 00:26:30,906
TO SELL THAT?
THREE.

00:26:30,906 --> 00:26:33,409
THREE. IN YOUR LOCAL AREA?
WELL, NO.
I'M FROM SOUTH CAROLINA,

00:26:33,409 --> 00:26:36,412
BUT WE WENT TO, UM, BATON ROUGE
AND LAFAYETTE, LOUISIANA,

00:26:36,412 --> 00:26:40,049
AND THEN TO HOUSTON, TEXAS.
SO SHORT OF PUTTING YOU
AND YOUR MOM IN A CAR

00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:43,052
WITH A BUNCH OF CAKES
AND TRAVELING THE COUNTRY...
RIGHT.

00:26:43,052 --> 00:26:46,021
HOW ARE WE GONNA SELL THESE?
WELL, HOPEFULLY,
I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE

00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:49,558
TO GET ON, UM,
ONE OF THE SHOPPING NETWORKS.
OKAY, LET'S JUST SAY THAT
FOR A SECOND.

00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:52,595
LET'S SAY I PUT YOU
ON THE SHOPPING NETWORK‐‐

00:26:52,595 --> 00:26:55,598
I CAN DO THAT‐‐AND I GET YOU
100,000 ORDERS FOR CAKES.

00:26:55,598 --> 00:26:58,601
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
KILL YOUR MOTHER TO MAKE THEM?

00:26:58,601 --> 00:27:02,304
HOW YOU GONNA DO THAT?
WELL, WE WOULD
PROBABLY HAVE TO DO

00:27:02,304 --> 00:27:05,674
A LITTLE DIFFERENT, UM,
WAY OF BAKING.
WHERE DO YOU MAKE 'EM NOW?

00:27:05,674 --> 00:27:08,677
WE‐‐I HAVE
A COMMERCIAL KITCHEN.
WELL, COULD YOU MAKE 5,000
IN A WEEK?

00:27:08,677 --> 00:27:13,115
OR WHAT KIND OF QUANTITIES
CAN YOU HANDLE?
I CAN MAKE 5,000 IN 30 DAYS.

00:27:13,115 --> 00:27:16,118
SO UNLESS YOU HAVE PERSONALLY
ENGAGED THE CONSUMER,

00:27:16,118 --> 00:27:19,255
YOU HAVE NOT MADE ANY SALES
TO A GROCERY STORE...
MM‐HMM. LET ME TELL YOU.

00:27:19,255 --> 00:27:21,257
SOMEBODY WHO HAS NO IDEA
WHO YOU ARE‐‐

00:27:21,257 --> 00:27:25,094
YOU HAVE NOT MADE SALES
IN THAT AREA YET?
UM, OKAY,
SO THIS IS MY LEMON CURD.

00:27:25,094 --> 00:27:28,097
I'M IN THE PROCESS OF HAVING
MY LEMON CURD PICKED UP

00:27:28,097 --> 00:27:30,666
TO BE CARRIED AT WHOLE FOODS.
OKAY.

00:27:30,666 --> 00:27:34,069
AND HOW ARE YOU GONNA PRODUCE
ENOUGH QUANTITY FOR THEM,

00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:37,473
ASSUMING THEY DO A ROLL‐OUT
ACROSS THE COUNTRY?
UM, I'M GONNA NEED YOUR HELP.

00:27:37,473 --> 00:27:40,276
HEY, KIM...
YES.

00:27:40,276 --> 00:27:43,746
I GET DOZENS AND DOZENS OF
CATALOGS, UH, A MONTH, AND I SEE

00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:47,116
SO MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE SELLING
THIS KIND OF PRODUCT‐‐CAKES

00:27:47,116 --> 00:27:49,285
AND PIES AND‐‐AND CHEESECAKES

00:27:49,285 --> 00:27:52,254
AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF,
SO IT'S VERY COMPETITIVE.
IF YOU CAN GET THAT PRODUCT

00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:55,024
IN THEIR MOUTHS AND LET THEM
TASTE IT OR GET, YOU KNOW,

00:27:55,024 --> 00:27:58,027
GET SOMEBODY LIKE YOU
TO SAY HOW GOOD IT IS‐‐
SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE

00:27:58,027 --> 00:28:01,363
A VERY SMALL REGIONAL STRATEGY
THAT'S WORKING FOR YOU.

00:28:01,363 --> 00:28:04,934
MM‐HMM.
I MEAN, $27,000
IN 3 MONTHS ISN'T BAD.

00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:09,038
WHY CAN'T YOU AND YOUR MOM
HOP IN THE CAR, TAKE THE CAKES‐‐

00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:12,041
I'M ASSUMING THESE ARE
YOUR MOM'S RECIPES.
MY‐‐THEY'RE MY‐‐ACTUALLY,
YEAH, FAMILY RECIPES.

00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:15,044
MY GRANDMOTHER'S.
DAISY WAS MY GREAT AUNT.
WHY CAN'T YOU CONTINUE
TO DO THAT?

00:28:15,044 --> 00:28:18,380
JUST GO TO THESE TRADE SHOWS
AND SELL THEM THAT WAY.

00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,616
BECAUSE I WANT IT TO BE
A HUGE BUSINESS.

00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:23,586
I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW
HOW FABULOUS MY CAKES ARE.

00:28:23,586 --> 00:28:26,055
WHEN THEY THINK OF ORDERING
SOMETHING, THEY DON'T WANT

00:28:26,055 --> 00:28:28,791
TO ORDER FLOWERS, THEY DON'T
WANT TO ORDER FRUIT.

00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:32,361
THEY'RE THINKING, OH, MY GOSH.
I'M SENDING A CAKE.
HERE'S THE PROBLEM. THE‐‐THEY
ARE THE BEST I'VE EVER TRIED,

00:28:32,361 --> 00:28:35,965
BUT TO TURN THAT INTO A BUSINESS
IS A HUGE CHALLENGE,

00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:39,835
AND ONE THAT I'M NOT PREPARED
TO TAKE. I'M OUT.

00:28:39,835 --> 00:28:41,704
(whispers) OKAY.

00:28:41,704 --> 00:28:45,040
KIM, I SEE THIS
AS A WORD‐OF‐MOUTH TYPE

00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,843
OF BUSINESS,
AND I LOOK FOR FAST GROWTH.

00:28:47,843 --> 00:28:51,080
THANK YOU FOR A GREAT
EXPERIENCE, UH, TASTEWISE,

00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,449
BUT I'M OUT TODAY.

00:28:53,449 --> 00:28:57,186
SO 85% OF BUSINESSES IN AMERICA
ARE SMALL BUSINESSES

00:28:57,186 --> 00:29:00,489
THAT DO NOTHING BUT PROVIDE
A LIVING FOR THE OWNER,

00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:03,626
BUT THAT'S NOT
AN INVESTABLE BUSINESS.

00:29:03,626 --> 00:29:06,562
I WISH YOU ALL THE SUCCESS.
I WILL BE A CUSTOMER,

00:29:06,562 --> 00:29:09,965
BUT THERE'S REALLY NOTHING
TO INVEST IN TODAY. I'M OUT.

00:29:09,965 --> 00:29:12,034
(mouths word)

00:29:12,034 --> 00:29:15,571
KIM, I THINK THE BUSINESS IS
TOO SMALL FOR ME, SO I'M OUT.

00:29:22,578 --> 00:29:25,314
EVERYBODY'S OUT HERE
EXCEPT BARBARA.

00:29:25,314 --> 00:29:28,217
SO WHAT ARE WE DOING,
BARBARA?

00:29:28,217 --> 00:29:31,854
I LIKE <i>YOU</i> VERY MUCH.

00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:34,456
I THINK IT'S TOO SMALL
A BUSINESS,

00:29:34,456 --> 00:29:36,392
QUITE HONESTLY, TO INVEST IN.

00:29:36,392 --> 00:29:38,394
(mouths word)

00:29:38,394 --> 00:29:40,996
HOWEVER...

00:29:40,996 --> 00:29:44,300
I NOTICED WHEN YOU PASSED
YOUR DELICIOUS CAKE AROUND,

00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,436
EVERY GUY HERE ATE
MORE THAN 50% AND‐‐

00:29:47,436 --> 00:29:49,939
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
IT'S A GOOD INVESTMENT, BARBARA.

00:29:49,939 --> 00:29:53,008
BUT AFTER EACH OF THESE GUYS
DROPPED OUT,

00:29:53,008 --> 00:29:56,111
THEY'VE BENT FORWARD, I NOTICED,
AND HAD ANOTHER BITE.

00:29:56,111 --> 00:29:59,114
SO I'M GONNA TAKE A FLIER
ON THIS, BUT I AM WORRIED

00:29:59,114 --> 00:30:02,184
ABOUT MY GETTING MY MONEY OUT
OF A TINY LITTLE BUSINESS,

00:30:02,184 --> 00:30:04,153
SO HERE ARE THE TWO CONDITIONS‐‐

00:30:04,153 --> 00:30:07,289
FOR EVERY CAKE SOLD,
YOU MAIL ME $1.

00:30:07,289 --> 00:30:10,793
SO BY THE TIME
YOU SELL 50,000 CAKES,

00:30:10,793 --> 00:30:12,828
I'D HAVE MY MONEY BACK. OKAY?

00:30:12,828 --> 00:30:16,098
YES, MA'AM.
AND SECONDLY, THAT YOU MAKE SURE
YOUR MOTHER'S ON YOUR TEAM

00:30:16,098 --> 00:30:18,901
AND SHE'S GONNA BE HUSTLING
THESE CAKES AT EVERY TRADE SHOW,

00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:22,304
AND THE MONEY'S GONNA BE USED
FOR TRADE SHOWS.

00:30:22,304 --> 00:30:24,607
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:30:24,607 --> 00:30:26,609
DO WE HAVE A DEAL?

00:30:26,609 --> 00:30:29,378
(exhales deeply) OF COURSE.
YES, MA'AM.

00:30:29,378 --> 00:30:30,479
OOH!

00:30:30,479 --> 00:30:32,181

ALL RIGHT.

00:30:32,181 --> 00:30:34,249

I'M GONNA GET MY MONEY BACK.
THIS GIRL'S A HUSTLER.

MY ELEPHANT LADY.

00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:54,103

CUT OUT OF THE SAME CLOTH.

REALLY, REALLY COME TO FRUITION,

00:34:18,861 --> 00:34:21,864
MY WIFE'S FAVORITE.
SHE LIKES YOUR EYES.
YOU KNOW, SHANE,
I'M THE ONLY GUY HERE

00:34:21,864 --> 00:34:24,533
WHO HAS ACTUALLY EVER SWEPT
A FLOOR, I BET.

00:34:24,533 --> 00:34:27,937
I WAS A STAY‐AT‐HOME DAD
FOR THREE YEARS.
THERE YOU GO. LOOK AT
THAT MACARONI AND CHEESE.

00:34:27,937 --> 00:34:31,874
DISAPPEARS WITH EASE.
SEAN, HAVE YOU SHOWN THIS
TO ANY RETAILERS?

00:34:31,874 --> 00:34:34,310
I HAVE.
AND WHAT RESPONSE DID YOU GET?

00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:37,680
I'VE HEARD THINGS LIKE "MARKET
MOVER," AND‐‐AND THE FACT

00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,782
THAT IT BLOWS PEOPLE AWAY.

00:34:39,782 --> 00:34:42,785
I'VE TALKED WITH
ONE OF THE NATION'S

00:34:42,785 --> 00:34:44,353
LARGEST
JANITORIAL SUPPLIES COMPANIES,

00:34:44,353 --> 00:34:46,956
AND THEIR QUESTION TO ME WASN'T
WHETHER OR NOT I HAD A PRODUCT.

00:34:46,956 --> 00:34:50,726
THEY SAID, "SHANE, <i>WHEN</i> CAN YOU
HAVE A FINISHED PRODUCT?"
DID THEY GIVE YOU
A PURCHASE ORDER?

00:34:50,726 --> 00:34:52,728
THEY DIDN'T GIVE ME
A PURCHASE ORDER YET

00:34:52,728 --> 00:34:54,897
BECAUSE I'M NOT LICENSED,
BONDED, INSURED.

00:34:54,897 --> 00:34:57,933
I'M A‐‐I'M JUST
A ONE‐MAN COMPANY RIGHT NOW.
I'M TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND YOUR VISION

00:34:57,933 --> 00:34:59,468
FOR THIS BUSINESS.
OKAY.

00:34:59,468 --> 00:35:01,470
ARE WE GONNA MAKE BROOMS

00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:04,039
AND START SELLING 'EM
TO ALL KINDS OF STORES

00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:08,444
OR ARE WE GONNA GO AND TRY TO GO
TO BIG BROOM COMPANIES

00:35:08,444 --> 00:35:11,447
AND SELL THEM OUR BROOMS
SO THEY CAN MAKE IT?

00:35:11,447 --> 00:35:12,948
EXACTLY. ALL THE ABOVE.

00:35:12,948 --> 00:35:17,019
BUT, SHANE, WHY CAN'T WE GO TO
PEOPLE WHO ALREADY MAKE BROOMS

00:35:17,019 --> 00:35:20,756
AND GET 'EM TO SIMPLY USE THIS
WITHIN THEIR PRODUCTS?

00:35:20,756 --> 00:35:23,192
(Daymond) YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT A LICENSE?
YEAH.

00:35:23,192 --> 00:35:26,729
WELL,
I THOUGHT OF LICENSING.
WELL, I THINK YOU CAN DO THAT,
ROBERT, YOU CAN DO THAT,

00:35:26,729 --> 00:35:29,698
BUT THE REAL MONEY‐‐IF YOU CAN
SELL IT DIRECT TO THE CONSUMER,

00:35:29,698 --> 00:35:33,002
YOU COULD BUILD
$100 MILLION‐DOLLAR BUSINESS.
(O'Leary) ON A SINGLE PRODUCT?

00:35:33,002 --> 00:35:35,538
OH, SURE.
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE
TO RETAIL THIS AT?

00:35:35,538 --> 00:35:37,840
I'D BEAT THE PAVEMENT
AT RESTAURANTS, MOVIE THEATERS,

00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:41,110
HOSPITALS, SCHOOLS‐‐EVERYWHERE
I'VE GONE, AND I'LL ASK THEM,

00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:44,613
"WHAT WOULD YOU PAY
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS?"

00:35:44,613 --> 00:35:47,883
AND THE ANSWER IS
ALWAYS THE SAME‐‐$19.95.
THAT'S WONDERFUL. LET'S TALK
ABOUT MONEY, MY FRIEND.

00:35:47,883 --> 00:35:49,885
I DON'T WANT TO BE
IN THE BUSINESS

00:35:49,885 --> 00:35:51,754
OF MANUFACTURING BROOMS

00:35:51,754 --> 00:35:54,924
WHEN I CAN GO AND GET THAT
DISTRIBUTION ALL OVER THE WORLD

00:35:54,924 --> 00:35:56,926
AND JUST SIT THERE
AND COLLECT THE CHECK.

00:35:56,926 --> 00:35:59,395
THAT'S MY IDEA
OF A GREAT BUSINESS,

00:35:59,395 --> 00:36:03,832
AND I'D LIKE TO DO THAT WITH
YOU. I'M GONNA START RIGHT NOW.

00:36:03,832 --> 00:36:07,069
$40,000 FOR 20%‐‐
YOU GOT IT, KID.
(Harrington) I WOULDN'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT THAT OFFER YET.

00:36:07,069 --> 00:36:10,406
HE'S TALKING ABOUT JUST
LICENSING THIS PRODUCT, OKAY?

00:36:10,406 --> 00:36:13,676
THAT'S ABOUT 30% TO 40%
OF THE INCOME THAT YOU CAN MAKE

00:36:13,676 --> 00:36:15,945
AT THE END OF THE DAY
ON THIS PRODUCT.

00:36:15,945 --> 00:36:18,647
I THINK YOU NEED TO EXPLORE
NOT ONLY LICENSING,

00:36:18,647 --> 00:36:22,885
BUT DIRECT TO THE CONSUMER,
OKAY, AND THAT'S MY EXPERIENCE,

00:36:22,885 --> 00:36:25,354
AND I THINK, UM,
I AM INTERESTED.

00:36:25,354 --> 00:36:28,724
OKAY, $50,000 FOR 20%.
$50,000 FOR 20%.

00:36:28,724 --> 00:36:30,759
STOP LISTENING TO THESE GUYS,

00:36:30,759 --> 00:36:33,429
'CAUSE BY THE WAY, I COULD GET
ANOTHER TELEVISION GUY.

00:36:33,429 --> 00:36:36,198
WE DON'T NEED THIS
TELEVISION‐‐TELEVISION GUY.

00:36:36,198 --> 00:36:38,367
THERE'S LOTS OF TELEVISION GUYS.
I'M THE BEST, THOUGH.

00:36:38,367 --> 00:36:40,369
I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW

00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:43,239
THE STRATEGY THAT'S GONNA
MAKE YOU FILTHY RICH.

00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:45,207
AND TO DO THAT, WE'RE GOING
TO A LICENSE STRATEGY.

00:36:45,207 --> 00:36:47,977
SO I'M STARTING YOU RIGHT NOW.

00:36:47,977 --> 00:36:50,946
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU $50,000
FOR 20% 'CAUSE I'M NOT GREEDY.

00:36:50,946 --> 00:36:54,416
A SMALL PIECE FOR ME, I'M HAPPY.
I'LL MAKE THIS HAPPEN FOR YOU.

00:36:54,416 --> 00:36:57,886
A COUPLE OF PHONE CALLS,
WE'RE DONE.
SHANE, WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT
LICENSING THIS

00:36:57,886 --> 00:37:00,756
ALL OVER THE WORLD,
I DO THAT, TOO. OKAY?

00:37:00,756 --> 00:37:03,759
WHAT I DO THOUGH IS, FIRST I DO
THE TV COMMERCIAL HERE.

00:37:03,759 --> 00:37:06,428
THEN WE LICENSE <i>THAT</i>
ALL OVER THE WORLD, OKAY?

00:37:06,428 --> 00:37:09,431
SO IT'S A LOT EASIER
TO MAKE THAT PHONE CALL

00:37:09,431 --> 00:37:11,834
TO INDIA AND TO BRAZIL
WHEN WE HAVE A TV COMMERCIAL

00:37:11,834 --> 00:37:13,836
THAT HAS WORKED HERE
IN THE U. S.

00:37:13,836 --> 00:37:16,839
THAT WE CAN THEN GIVE TO THEM TO
ROLL OUT IN THAT LOCAL MARKET.

00:37:16,839 --> 00:37:19,842
BUT, YOU KNOW, I THINK‐‐I THINK
THE BIGGER PROBLEM HERE, SHANE,

00:37:19,842 --> 00:37:22,945
IS THAT YOU WANT TO RUN
YOUR OWN COMPANY. CORRECT?

00:37:22,945 --> 00:37:26,282
SURE. WITH‐‐WITH...
'CAUSE YOU SAID YOU WANT
TO MAKE PRODUCT.

00:37:26,282 --> 00:37:29,285
WITH SOMEONE WITH SOME BUSINESS
SAVVY LIKE YOURSELVES.
LIKE‐‐LIKE, ME, YES.

00:37:29,285 --> 00:37:32,288
L‐LIKE YOU.
BUT YOU WANT TO RUN
YOUR OWN COMPANY

00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:34,590
AND POTENTIALLY GROW SweepEasy,
COME UP WITH OTHER PATENTS,

00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:37,593
AND HAVE A COMPANY.
DAYMOND, CLOTHING GUY‐‐WHAT DO
YOU HAVE TO DO WITH THIS?

00:37:37,593 --> 00:37:39,595
WELL, HERE'S WHAT
I HAVE TO DO WITH IT‐‐

00:37:39,595 --> 00:37:42,598
WHETHER YOU LIKE FUBU OR NOT,
I CREATED IT IN THE BASEMENT,

00:37:42,598 --> 00:37:45,668
AND EVERYBODY
ON THE DAMN PLANET KNOWS IT.
THAT'S EVERYBODY'S STORY HERE.
EVERYBODY HAS THAT STORY.

00:37:45,668 --> 00:37:48,003
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT YOU DID.
ARE YOU KIDDING?

00:37:48,003 --> 00:37:50,272
I HAVE BRANDED A STINKING
PAIR OF JEANS GLOBALLY,

00:37:50,272 --> 00:37:52,341
AND I WILL DO THAT
WITH THE BROOM.

00:37:52,341 --> 00:37:55,511
YOU SEE, THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE.
THE BROOM AND THE CLOTHING HAVE
NOTHING TO DO WITH EACH OTHER.

00:37:55,511 --> 00:37:58,113
YOU SEE? HE'S NOT
EVEN LETTING ME SPEAK.

00:37:58,113 --> 00:38:01,550
IMAGINE WHAT
HE'S GONNA DO TO YOU.
WHAT ARE YOU BRINGING
TO THE TABLE, DAYMOND?

00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:03,952
I'M BRINGING $75,000.
FOR WHAT?

00:38:03,952 --> 00:38:05,954
I'M BRINGING $75,000 FOR 33%,

00:38:05,954 --> 00:38:09,358
BUT WE'LL CREATE
AN ENTIRE COMPANY.
FOR THE RECORD,

00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:11,360
I'M DEFINITELY OUT.
LET ME TELL YOU WHY.

00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,363
'CAUSE I DON'T SEE YOU
AS THE KIND OF GUY

00:38:14,363 --> 00:38:18,400
WHO COULD GO THROUGH
A FINISH LINE, HONEST TO GOD.
(Harrington) I'M GONNA
GIVE AN OFFER.

00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,537
YOU CAME IN ASKING
FOR $40,000, 25%.

00:38:21,537 --> 00:38:24,073
I'M GONNA BUMP YOUR $40,000
A LITTLE BIT,

00:38:24,073 --> 00:38:27,309
BUT I'M NOT GONNA GO TO $75,000
BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY,

00:38:27,309 --> 00:38:31,146
MY $50,000 OFFER FOR 25%

00:38:31,146 --> 00:38:33,148
IS GONNA BE YOUR BEST DEAL.

00:38:33,148 --> 00:38:35,884
BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA MAKE
MILLIONS MORE OVER TIME,

00:38:35,884 --> 00:38:39,221
BECAUSE THIS HAS TO GO ON
TELEVISION, AND YOU KNOW THAT.

00:38:39,221 --> 00:38:41,090
DO YOU AGREE WITH ME?

00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:43,459
I AGREE THAT IT HAS
TO GO ON TELEVISION.

00:38:43,459 --> 00:38:47,162
OKAY, SO WE GOTTA START
WITH TV‐‐
BUT YOU NEED A LICENSE
ALL AROUND THE WORLD.

00:38:47,162 --> 00:38:48,157
YOU DEFINITELY NEED THIS BROOM.

00:38:48,157 --> 00:38:50,927
THIS BROOM SPEAKS
EVERY LANGUAGE ON EARTH.

00:38:50,927 --> 00:38:54,230
SURE.
EVERY KID SPILLS CRAP ON
THE FLOOR ALL AROUND THE WORLD.

00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:57,934
SO LET'S THINK BIG. YOU NEED ME
TO THINK BIG. STOP THINKING SO‐‐

00:38:57,934 --> 00:39:00,770
SHANE, REMEMBER
WHO'S SAYING THIS TO YOU.
BARBARA, IF YOU‐‐BARBARA.

00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:03,139
THIS GUY'S A SHARK.
THEY ALL ARE.

00:39:03,139 --> 00:39:06,275
YOU BETTER SLOW DOWN AND THINK.
YOU'RE A NICE GUY.

00:39:09,979 --> 00:39:11,914
♪♪♪

00:39:18,488 --> 00:39:20,656
<i>ONE SHARK IS OUT,</i>

00:39:20,656 --> 00:39:23,226
<i>BUT THE OTHERS ARE</i>
<i>IN A FEEDING FRENZY</i>

00:39:23,226 --> 00:39:27,096

YOU BETTER SLOW DOWN AND THINK.
YOU'RE A NICE GUY.

00:39:27,096 --> 00:39:30,700
LET ME FINISH WITH THIS‐‐
I DON'T WANT TO GO TO WAR

00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,336
WITH YOU, MY FRIEND. YOU BRING
SOME VALUE TO THE TABLE,

00:39:33,336 --> 00:39:36,472
AND YOU'RE THE TV GUY I DO KNOW.
LET'S GO 50/50. LET'S GO‐‐
GO AND CALL YOUR WIFE.

00:39:36,472 --> 00:39:38,674
BARBARA,
IF YOU SCREW THIS UP FOR ME,

00:39:38,674 --> 00:39:40,943
I'M GONNA SPANK YOU
LIKE A BABY SEAL.

00:39:40,943 --> 00:39:43,312
NOW LISTEN, LET'S GET BACK
TO BUSINESS HERE. 50/50, KEVIN.

00:39:43,312 --> 00:39:46,682
LET'S STOP FIGHTING 'CAUSE
I'M GONNA WIN THIS FIGHT

00:39:46,682 --> 00:39:50,086
IF WE START IT.
YOU KNOW, KEVIN,
I‐I RESPECT YOU,

00:39:50,086 --> 00:39:53,489
BUT THIS IS A PRODUCT I WANT
TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL,

00:39:53,489 --> 00:39:58,661
BECAUSE SEE, I WANT TO PUT HIM
AS THE FACE OF THIS PRODUCT.
DON'T LET
THAT VANITY THING WORK.

00:39:58,661 --> 00:40:01,497
DON'T LET THAT WORK ON YOU.
YOU‐‐NO. YOU'RE GONNA BE THE GUY
ON THE SHOPPING CHANNELS.

00:40:01,497 --> 00:40:03,733
YOU'RE GONNA‐‐YOUR FACE
COULD BE ON THE BOX,

00:40:03,733 --> 00:40:07,203
SELLING THIS PRODUCT.
YOU CAN DO GREAT.
UGH, THAT'S SO HOLLYWOOD.
DON'T LET HIM PLAY THAT CARD.

00:40:07,203 --> 00:40:10,373
(laughs)
I DON'T NEED ANY PARTNERS
ON THIS DEAL, OKAY?

00:40:10,373 --> 00:40:13,443
SHANE, I'M WITH KEVIN. I THINK
YOU'RE GONNA NEED MORE MONEY.

00:40:13,443 --> 00:40:16,646
I'D LIKE TO COME IN
ON THE LICENSING DEAL,

00:40:16,646 --> 00:40:19,348
'CAUSE I THINK THAT IS THE ONLY
ROUTE THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME.

00:40:19,348 --> 00:40:22,385
I'LL PUT UP ANOTHER $40,000
FOR THAT SAME 20%.
$80,000 FOR 20%?

00:40:22,385 --> 00:40:24,887
YEAH.
LET'S LIFT IT TO 25%.

00:40:24,887 --> 00:40:26,889
OKAY. SO $80,000 FOR 25%,

00:40:26,889 --> 00:40:29,058
BECAUSE I THINK
YOU'RE GONNA NEED MORE CASH.

00:40:29,058 --> 00:40:33,196
LIFE IS VERY SIMPLE.
TWO GUYS WANT TO BUILD BROOMS.

00:40:33,196 --> 00:40:35,865
TWO GUYS WANT TO MAKE MONEY.
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

00:40:35,865 --> 00:40:39,135
SHANE, SHANE, YOU KNOW WHAT? WE
UNDERSTAND PRODUCT, AND WE WILL

00:40:39,135 --> 00:40:42,138
GET ALSO LICENSING ONCE
WE GET TO A COMFORTABLE LEVEL.

00:40:42,138 --> 00:40:46,008
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
LET'S DO SOMETHING.
$80,000
FOR 25% OF THE COMPANY?

00:40:46,008 --> 00:40:48,644
CORRECT.
$80,000, 25% OF THE COMPANY.

00:40:48,644 --> 00:40:51,848
HE DOES THE INFOMERCIALS,
I DO PRODUCT TO STORES,

00:40:51,848 --> 00:40:56,586
WE HELP BUILD A BRAND ITSELF.

00:40:56,586 --> 00:41:01,324
SHANE, I WANT‐‐
I WANT AN ANSWER.
I'M GONNA CALL MY WIFE.

00:41:01,324 --> 00:41:03,826
I WANT TO TALK TO YOUR WIFE.
YOU WANT TO TALK TO MY WIFE?

00:41:03,826 --> 00:41:06,996
YEAH. GET HER ON THE PHONE.
I WANT TO TALK TO HER.
I'M ACTUALLY THE ONE WHO WEARS
THE PANTS IN THE FAMILY,

00:41:06,996 --> 00:41:09,765
AND SHE'LL TELL YOU THAT.
I GET THAT, BUT I'M NOT‐‐
I'M NOT SURE‐‐

00:41:09,765 --> 00:41:12,435
YOU SEE HOW
HE'S INSULTING YOU ALREADY?

00:41:12,435 --> 00:41:14,704
JUST PULL THE CORD
ON THESE TWO GUYS.

00:41:14,704 --> 00:41:18,541
SHANE, I THINK YOU NEED TO MAKE
A DECISION RIGHT NOW.
YOU KNOW...

00:41:18,541 --> 00:41:21,077
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY
DIFFERENT TO MY WIFE?

00:41:21,077 --> 00:41:23,079
LET'S‐‐I WANT TO TALK TO HER.
WELL...

00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:25,314
LET'S TALK TO HER.
YOU KNOW, TALK IS CHEAP.

00:41:25,314 --> 00:41:28,351
THAT'S THE BEAUTIFUL THING
ABOUT IT. LET'S TALK.
(Daymond) SHANE, LISTEN.
I'M STARTING...

00:41:28,351 --> 00:41:31,687
WE HAVE ANOTHER MINUTE. SHANE,
LET'S HAVE A MINUTE. SILENCE.
ONE SECOND, KEVIN.
I'M STARTING TO RECONSIDER.

00:41:31,687 --> 00:41:34,156
I‐I MAY RECONSIDER THE OFFER.
YOU KNOW WHY HE'S WORRIED?

00:41:34,156 --> 00:41:37,193
BECAUSE IN THE BACK
OF YOUR MIND, SEAN...
AND SCRAPE HIM OFF OF THAT THING
RIGHT THERE RIGHT NOW.

00:41:37,193 --> 00:41:39,362
YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S
SOMETHING HERE. YOU KNOW THERE'S

00:41:39,362 --> 00:41:41,697
SOMETHING HERE IN THIS LICENSE
DEAL YOU SHOULD CONSIDER.

00:41:41,697 --> 00:41:43,866
IT'S A MUCH BIGGER VISION,
YOU BECOME MUCH WEALTHIER,

00:41:43,866 --> 00:41:47,370
AND IT HAPPENS FASTER.
KEVIN, YOU'RE REALLY
EMBARRASSING YOURSELF RIGHT NOW.

00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:51,507
STAY HERE. I'LL BE BACK
TO YOU IN A MINUTE.
HE WALKS OUT, I'M WITHDRAWING.

00:41:51,507 --> 00:41:54,243
(Robert) SHANE, BE A MAN,
FOR GODS SAKE.
OKAY, WELL, SURE.
I‐I'M NEGOTIATING, ROBERT.

00:41:54,243 --> 00:41:56,946
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT
I FEEL LIKE I'M DOING.

00:41:56,946 --> 00:42:00,383
I'M TRYING TO FIND WHAT'S BEST
FOR MY FAMILY AND FOR ME, SO...
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT HIM, BUT I'VE
JUST REDUCED MY $40,000 TO‐‐

00:42:00,383 --> 00:42:02,718
LISTEN. I'VE JUST REDUCED
MY $40,000 TO $30,000,

00:42:02,718 --> 00:42:04,987
SO NOW MY DEAL IS $70,000.

00:42:04,987 --> 00:42:08,424
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO RETAIN
THAT OFFER, AND I‐‐

00:42:08,424 --> 00:42:10,426
IF YOU WILL GO BACK
TO YOUR ORIGINAL OFFER,

00:42:10,426 --> 00:42:13,863
I'M GONNA‐‐I'M GONNA SAY
THAT I WANNA WORK WITH YOU.
RIGHT NOW?
