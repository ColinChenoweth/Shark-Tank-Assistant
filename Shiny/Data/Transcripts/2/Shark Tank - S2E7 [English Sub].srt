WELL, MY TIME ALONE

THAT YOU'RE DRIVING

00:02:41,444 --> 00:02:45,048
DOWN THE STREET WITH
YOUR BEAUTIFUL LITTLE CHILD HERE

00:02:45,048 --> 00:02:47,850

00:03:03,466 --> 00:03:06,703
LES, I GOTTA KNOW‐‐
WHAT WAS IN THAT STUFF?

00:03:06,703 --> 00:03:09,405
WHAT WAS THAT GREEN STUFF?
SPLIT PEA SOUP AND CORN.

00:03:09,405 --> 00:03:13,242
FOR THE PARENTS OF THE 58%
OF CHILDREN WHO GET CARSICK,

00:03:13,242 --> 00:03:15,244
THIS IS
AN ALL‐TOO‐FAMILIAR SITUATION.

00:03:15,244 --> 00:03:18,081
IT IS LIKE DRIVING AROUND
WITH A TICKING TIME BOMB.

00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:22,051
YOUR POOR CHILD IS
SOPPING IN VOMIT.

00:03:22,051 --> 00:03:24,320
OFTEN, YOU JUST WANT TO THROW
THEIR WHOLE OUTFITS AWAY,

00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,557
BECAUSE TOUCHING IT IS TOO GROSS
TO EVEN THINK ABOUT.

00:03:27,557 --> 00:03:30,927
THIS IS WHY I CREATED
THE CARSIK BIB.

00:03:30,927 --> 00:03:36,099
THE CARSIK BIB IS THE SMART,
HANDS‐FREE BARF BAG FOR KIDS.

00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:38,368
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.
(Velcro rips)

00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,436
YOU ATTACH IT
LIKE A REGULAR BIB.

00:03:40,436 --> 00:03:43,272

00:03:43,272 --> 00:03:46,242
IT‐‐IT'S A BIB.
IT'S A BIB.
IT'S A CARSIK BIB.

00:03:46,242 --> 00:03:49,512
IT'S A FEED BAG, TOO.
(Daymond) YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:03:49,512 --> 00:03:52,382
IT'S THE REVERSE FEED BAG.
NO KIDDING.

00:03:52,382 --> 00:03:54,684
THEN, YOU KNOW,
WHEN IT HAPPENS...

00:03:54,684 --> 00:03:57,420
(man) UGH.

00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,088
(sharks laugh)

00:04:00,556 --> 00:04:03,359
I LOVE IT.
AND‐‐AND IF THE KID
GETS HUNGRY LATER...

00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:05,528
YOU STICK A STRAW IN IT.
(laughs)

00:04:05,528 --> 00:04:08,531
SERIOUSLY, REGARDLESS
OF WHAT THE KID DOES,

00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:11,567
EVERYTHING IS DIRECTED INTO
AND CONTAINED IN THE POUCH.

00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:14,370
A PAD IN THE POUCH
SOAKS UP LIQUID,

00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,671
WHICH PREVENTS SPILLING
AND REDUCES ODOR.

00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:18,107
THEN, YOU KNOW,
AFTER IT'S DONE,

00:04:18,107 --> 00:04:20,109
YOU FIND A SAFE PLACE
TO PULL OVER.

00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:22,211
YOU REMOVE THE CARSIK BIB...

00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:23,913
(Velcro rips)

00:04:23,913 --> 00:04:27,316
THROW EVERYTHING
IN THE POUCH...

00:04:27,316 --> 00:04:31,387
AND THE BOTTOM FLIPS UP,

00:04:31,387 --> 00:04:33,923
ZIPS SHUT,
AND YOU THROW IT ALL AWAY.

00:04:33,923 --> 00:04:35,758
I WILL SAY THIS‐‐

00:04:35,758 --> 00:04:38,694
I HAVE A HARD TIME
LISTENING TO YOU

00:04:38,694 --> 00:04:41,230

00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:45,435
(sharks laugh)

00:04:45,435 --> 00:04:47,336
HOW DID YOU THINK OF THIS?
I GOTTA KNOW.

00:04:47,336 --> 00:04:50,339
WHAT WAS THE MOTIVATION?
WELL, HERE'S THE DEAL.
THIS IS FROM EXPERIENCE.

00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:54,610
I HAVE TWO LITTLE BOYS WHO GET
CARSICK, AND THEY THROW UP

00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,612
AND THEY GIVE NO WARNING.

00:04:56,612 --> 00:04:59,682
THERE ARE NO PRODUCTS
THAT DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE.
BUT, LES, I'M DRIVING MY CAR,

00:04:59,682 --> 00:05:02,685
AND MY KID'S PUKING IN THE BACK.
HOW DO I TURN AROUND QUICKLY,

00:05:02,685 --> 00:05:05,588
PUT IT AROUND HIS NECK OR DO I
JUST PERMANENTLY PUT THAT

00:05:05,588 --> 00:05:07,590
ON THE CHILD EVERY DAY
OF HIS LIFE?
EVERY DAY.

00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,392
WAITING. WAITING.
EVERYWHERE HE GOES.

00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:12,161
SOME CHILDREN SERIOUSLY THROW UP
EVERY TIME THEY DRIVE ANYWHERE,

00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:15,765
LIKE, 15 MINUTES,
THEY'RE THROWING UP.
CAN I SEE ONE OF THOSE,
PLEASE?

00:05:15,765 --> 00:05:18,401
YEAH, YEAH.
(Daymond) JUST GIVE ME ONE.
I MAY NEED IT.

00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:21,237
WHAT'S THE COST TO MAKE ONE?
19 CENTS.

00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:24,841
INCLUDING THE PAD
AT THE BOTTOM?
YES, INCLUDING. UM...

00:05:24,841 --> 00:05:28,177
(laughs) NOW I KNOW
WHY THE KID IS THROWING UP.

00:05:28,177 --> 00:05:32,515
IS THIS
A MULTIPURPOSE PRODUCT?
WELL, HERE'S THE DEAL, IS THAT
I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING MYSELF.

00:05:32,515 --> 00:05:36,352
I‐I BUILT THE PROTOTYPE MYSELF,
I'VE BEEN SELLING THEM MYSELF,

00:05:36,352 --> 00:05:38,688
AND I HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTING
THEM OF PARTS, YOU KNOW,

00:05:38,688 --> 00:05:42,225
LIKE THE‐‐LIKE THE BIB THERE IS
A SHOWER CURTAIN I CUT UP.

00:05:42,225 --> 00:05:44,327
SO I'VE, YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN
USING MY IN‐‐IN, YOU KNOW,

00:05:44,327 --> 00:05:45,995
MY, UH...
INGENUITY.

00:05:45,995 --> 00:05:47,997
INGENUITY. YOU KNOW, WHEN
IT'S ACTUALLY MANUFACTURED,

00:05:47,997 --> 00:05:50,032
UH, PROFESSIONALLY,
IT WILL BE MADE

00:05:50,032 --> 00:05:53,236
OF JUST
THE SAME BASIC MATERIALS.
THE ONLY THING I THINK

00:05:53,236 --> 00:05:55,505
IS THE‐‐THE‐‐
WORSE THAN VOMITING

00:05:55,505 --> 00:05:58,574
IS RIDING AROUND WITH
A BAG OF VOMIT ON YOUR NECK.

00:05:58,574 --> 00:06:01,544
(laughs)
(laughs)

00:06:01,544 --> 00:06:03,913
HEY, LISTEN, WHEN MY KIDS
WERE LITTLE, THEY WOULD...

00:06:03,913 --> 00:06:05,915
(imitates vomiting)
WHACK!

00:06:05,915 --> 00:06:08,584
(laughs)

00:06:08,584 --> 00:06:11,354
WHAT WERE YOUR SALES?
OKAY, SO I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO MASS‐PRODUCE THIS.

00:06:11,354 --> 00:06:13,356
I JUST HAVE THESE ONES
YOU HAVE HERE.

00:06:13,356 --> 00:06:15,358
I, UM, SOLD 'EM ONLINE
WITH A VERY, YOU KNOW,

00:06:15,358 --> 00:06:17,393
TEN HITS A DAY ON A WEB SITE‐‐
VERY SMALL TEST RUN.

00:06:17,393 --> 00:06:19,929
I SOLD 160 OF 'EM
IN JUST A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

00:06:19,929 --> 00:06:24,467
HOW MUCH MONEY
DO YOU HAVE INTO THIS?
UM, $1,300 AND I'VE DONE
EVERYTHING MYSELF.

00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,435
IF I HAD HIRED OUT EVERYTHING,

00:06:26,435 --> 00:06:29,438
I COULD HAVE EASILY SPENT
$10,000, $20,000.
YOU HAVE $1,300,

00:06:29,438 --> 00:06:32,742
AND YOU'RE ASKING FOR $30,000
FOR 15%.
RIGHT.

00:06:32,742 --> 00:06:36,012
UH, I COULDN'T GIVE YOU
$30,000 FOR THIS.

00:06:36,012 --> 00:06:38,581
I'M OUT.

00:06:38,581 --> 00:06:41,417
I GOTTA TELL YA, I MEAN, I‐‐

00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:45,154
IF I ACTUALLY GAVE YOU 30 GRAND,
I <i>WOULD</i> THROW UP IN THIS THING.

00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,323
I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE DOING THAT.

00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,325
IT'S NOT A PLACE
WHERE I WANT TO SAY,

00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:52,328
"I MADE A GREAT INVESTMENT TODAY
IN BARF BAGS."

00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,498
IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD
IN MY PORTFOLIO.

00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,934
I'M OUT.

00:06:57,934 --> 00:07:00,503
HERE'S ANOTHER THING
I WORRY ABOUT, LES,

00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,338
IS A LIABILITY ISSUE,

00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:05,741
IN THAT YOU GOT A CHILD
YOU CAN'T GET TO

00:07:05,741 --> 00:07:08,678
WITH SOMETHING ATTACHED
AROUND ITS NECK.

00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,746
AND I JUST KNOW KIDS,

00:07:10,746 --> 00:07:13,516
AND WHEN SOMETHING HAS
A CHANCE TO GO WRONG,

00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,885
IT'S GONNA GO WRONG.
TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION‐‐

00:07:15,885 --> 00:07:18,354
THERE ARE ALREADY BIBS MADE
FOR‐‐DISPOSABLE BIBS MADE‐‐

00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:21,390
APPROVED ON CHILDREN
AS‐‐AS YOUNG AS 6 MONTHS,

00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:24,393
AND SO THIS IS NOT SOMETHING
THAT'S UNTESTED OR UNDONE.
I‐I UNDERSTAND THAT,

00:07:24,393 --> 00:07:27,330
BUT USUALLY A CHILD WITH
A BIB ON, YOU'RE FEEDING THEM

00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,365
AND YOU'RE THERE WITH 'EM.

00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,400
I‐I LIKE YOU A LOT, LES,

00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,770
AND I‐‐AND I WISH YOU
ALL THE BEST, BUT I'M OUT.

00:07:36,405 --> 00:07:38,741
LOOK, LES, I'M LIKE JEFF.

00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:40,743
I WORRY ABOUT MY KID BEHIND ME

00:07:40,743 --> 00:07:43,546
WITH A PLASTIC BAG
AROUND THEIR NECK

00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,082
THAT I CAN'T GET TO THEM.

00:07:46,082 --> 00:07:48,184
I'M OUT.

00:07:50,353 --> 00:07:52,355
I HAVE A 5 YEAR OLD.

00:07:52,355 --> 00:07:55,257
I CAN'T IMAGINE HANGING THIS
ON HER NECK.

00:07:55,257 --> 00:07:57,360
I'M OUT.

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,397
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU ALL.
(Jeff) YOU BET. GOOD LUCK.

00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:04,900
ALL RIGHT. TRY NOT TO TRACK OUT
THE VOMIT TOO FAR, HUH?

00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,436
NOW WE'VE SEEN EVERYTHING.

00:08:07,436 --> 00:08:09,505
I THINK IT STILL HAS
A LOT OF POTENTIAL.

00:08:09,505 --> 00:08:11,507
I THINK IT'S SOMETHING
THAT THERE'S A‐‐

00:08:11,507 --> 00:08:13,509
THERE'S A HUGE MARKET FOR,
AND THEY DIDN'T SEE IT.

00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:15,745
THAT'S FINE. THAT'S FIVE PEOPLE.

00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,914

THE GAME OF FOOTBALL
IS THE NUMBER ONE SPORT,

AND EVERY YEAR,

00:08:56,385 --> 00:08:58,888

TO HAVING HEATSTROKES

KIDS ARE DYING RIGHT NOW,

THIS PRODUCT IS LEGIT.

IT ATTACHES WITH VELCRO.

00:10:55,671 --> 00:10:58,440
IT HAS A PROTECTIVE SHELL,
SO IT'S IMPACT‐RESISTANT.

00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,410
IT HOLDS A 16‐OUNCE BLADDER

00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,079
THAT'S MADE OUT
OF ANTIMICROBIAL MATERIAL.

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,816
AND THEN THERE'S A TUBE THAT
COMES AROUND THE SHOULDER PADS

00:11:06,816 --> 00:11:09,084
AND HAS A BITE VALVE.

00:11:09,084 --> 00:11:12,087

IT'S ACTUALLY HELD FIRMLY
AGAINST THE CHEST WITH VELCRO.

IT'S LOUD,
AND IT'S DANGEROUS.

00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,888
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
THE BLADES ON THIS LAWN MOWER

00:20:39,888 --> 00:20:41,890
SPIN AT OVER
150 MILES PER HOUR,

00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:45,394

HOSPITAL INJURIES EVERY YEAR.

BUT THAT'S NOT
THE REASON I'M HERE.

00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:51,133
THE REASON I'M HERE IS BECAUSE
LAWN MOWERS ARE TERRIBLE,

00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:53,435
<i>TERRIBLE</i> FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.

00:20:53,435 --> 00:20:57,439
EMISSIONS FROM LAWN MOWERS IS
TOTALLY UNREGULATED,

00:20:57,439 --> 00:21:00,108
AND THE AMOUNT OF POLLUTION
THAT'S EMITTED

00:21:00,108 --> 00:21:02,377
IN JUST ONE HOUR
OF USING A LAWN MOWER

00:21:02,377 --> 00:21:04,846
IS LIKE DRIVING TEN CARS.

00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,448
REALLY?

00:21:06,448 --> 00:21:10,085
WHY IS EVERYBODY TALKING ABOUT
CARS WHEN LAWN MOWERS ARE

00:21:10,085 --> 00:21:12,421
WORSE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT?
THEY ARE BIG‐TIME POLLUTERS.

00:21:12,421 --> 00:21:16,191
SO THE NEXT BIG
BILLION‐DOLLAR MOVEMENT

00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,860
IS REDUCING EMISSIONS
FROM LAWN AND GARDEN EQUIPMENT.

00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,562
WHO SAID?

00:21:20,562 --> 00:21:24,199
THE E. P. A. IS ABOUT
TO REGULATE, COME 2012,

00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,168
EMISSIONS
ON LAWN AND GARDEN EQUIPMENT,

00:21:26,168 --> 00:21:28,170
AND IT'S ALREADY STARTING NOW.

00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:31,006
SO I'VE COME UP
WITH A FANTASTIC SOLUTION,

00:21:31,006 --> 00:21:33,275
AND IT'S CALLED THE ECOMOWER.

00:21:33,275 --> 00:21:35,944
THE ECOMOWER IS THE WORLD'S
MOST ECO‐FRIENDLY LAWN MOWER‐‐

00:21:35,944 --> 00:21:38,380
REQUIRES NO GAS, NO BATTERIES,
AND IT'S COMPLETELY SILENT.

00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,349
SO LET ME GIVE YOU A QUICK
EXAMPLE ON HOW IT WORKS.

00:21:41,349 --> 00:21:45,520
SO THE ECOMOWER
PUSHES WITH EASE.

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,557
IT'S VERY, VERY, VERY EASY
TO PUSH IT.

00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,226
AND YOU'LL NOTICE
THAT AS I CUT THE GRASS,

00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,829
THE CLIPPINGS GENTLY COME DOWN
BEHIND THE MOWER

00:21:53,829 --> 00:21:57,232
AND ACTUALLY NATURALLY
FERTILIZE YOUR LAWN.

00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,567
NOW THE REASON THAT

00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,769
THIS ISN'T YOUR GRANDFATHER'S
OLD LAWN MOWER

00:22:00,769 --> 00:22:03,438
IS THAT IT HAS
A FRICTIONLESS CUTTING SYSTEM.

00:22:03,438 --> 00:22:06,508
WHEN THESE BLADES SPIN,
THEY'RE ACTUALLY NOT TOUCHING.

00:22:06,508 --> 00:22:08,510
THERE'S A VERY SMALL GAP

00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,512
THAT CREATES NO FRICTION,
NO CONTACT,

00:22:10,512 --> 00:22:14,216
AND THE BEAUTY OF THAT IS
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SHARPEN IT.

00:22:14,216 --> 00:22:16,051

ROMANCING THE TRUTH.

00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:29,898

SHARPENING AND THEY'RE HARDER

YOU'RE BASICALLY SAYING

THIS DIFFERENT‐‐AND STOP ME

YOU DON'T NEED TO SHARPEN IT.

THAT NO OTHER, UH, LAWN MOWER

IT DOESN'T NEED SHARPENING.
THIS IS A WAY FOR US

LOTS OF GUYS MANUFACTURE THESE.

THAT BUY THESE MOWERS

00:25:41,222 --> 00:25:43,491
DO IT 'CAUSE YOU BURN
OVER 400 CALORIES AN HOUR.

00:25:43,491 --> 00:25:46,094
THERE'S THIS WHOLE SECTION
OF THE MARKET

00:25:46,094 --> 00:25:49,197
THAT WANTS TO MOW THE LAWN
TO STAY HEALTHY AND STAY FIT

00:25:49,197 --> 00:25:52,233
BUT THEY'RE ALREADY DOING IT
WITH EVERYBODY ELSE'S MOWER.

00:25:52,233 --> 00:25:55,070
THE VALUE IS
IN THE NAME "ECOMOWER."
IT'S IN THE NAME.

00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,238
I‐I THINK THE PRESENTATION
SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT

00:25:57,238 --> 00:26:00,241
"I'VE LICENSED IT TO THE BIGGEST
MANUFACTURER IN THIS MARKET

00:26:00,241 --> 00:26:03,078
AND THAT MARKET," AND WE'RE
GONNA GET SOMETHING FOR IT.

00:26:03,078 --> 00:26:05,447
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WOULD WORK,

00:26:05,447 --> 00:26:08,383
BUT FOR ME,
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TODAY.

00:26:08,383 --> 00:26:10,485
I'M OUT.

00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:12,587
YOU'RE OUT.
(man) BARBARA?

00:26:12,587 --> 00:26:15,490
I DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH
CONFIDENCE IN THE NAME,

00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,827
AND I THINK YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE ENORMOUS COMPETITION,

00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,695
SO I'M OUT.

00:26:20,695 --> 00:26:22,330
I THINK YOU'VE PROVEN

00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25,533
THAT YOU'RE A SUCCESSFUL
ONLINE RETAILER OF MOWERS.

00:26:25,533 --> 00:26:29,404
NOW YOU WANNA BECOME
A MANUFACTURER AND BRAND THEM.

00:26:29,404 --> 00:26:33,608
I'M CONFUSED AND NOT
THAT INTERESTED. I'M OUT.

00:26:33,608 --> 00:26:36,277
YOU KNOW, I‐I MEAN,

00:26:36,277 --> 00:26:38,680
I CAN SEE, IN THE FUTURE,
MORE PEOPLE DOING THIS,

00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,648
ESPECIALLY PEOPLE OUT HERE
WITH SMALL LAWNS.

00:26:40,648 --> 00:26:43,651
YEAH, YOU'VE GOT THE NAME,
AND I THINK IT'S A COOL NAME.

00:26:43,651 --> 00:26:46,321
YOU HAVEN'T SOLD ONE OF THEM.
YOU KNOW THAT IT'S BETTER

00:26:46,321 --> 00:26:49,924
THAN THE ONES
THAT I HAVE BEEN SELLING.
WE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BETTER
THAN THE OTHER ONES,

00:26:49,924 --> 00:26:53,261
'CAUSE YOU DIDN'T BRING
ONE OF THE OTHER ONES HERE.

00:26:53,261 --> 00:26:55,997
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M SORRY.
I'M OUT.

00:26:55,997 --> 00:26:58,433
SO LET ME ASK YOU THIS‐‐
NOW THAT WE'RE ALL‐‐

00:26:58,433 --> 00:27:00,535
YOU ARE ALL
ON THE SAME PAGE‐‐

00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:03,538
IF I COULD'VE DONE ONE THING
BETTER, WHAT WOULD THAT BE?
NOT COME HERE.

00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:05,840
DON'T ASK ME TO INVEST
IN A PRODUCT

00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,842
YOU HAVEN'T SOLD ONE OF.
YOU CREATED A BRAND,

00:27:07,842 --> 00:27:10,545
YOU PUT THAT BRAND
ON SOMEONE ELSE'S MOWER,

00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:13,281
AND YOU HAVEN'T SOLD ONE YET.

00:27:13,281 --> 00:27:18,720
THIS IS OFFENSIVE. I MEAN,
HE'S ASKING FOR <i>$90,000.</i>

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,489
HE HAS NOT SOLD ONE.

00:27:21,489 --> 00:27:22,824
HIS SALES PITCH WAS

00:27:22,824 --> 00:27:27,395
"THE GRASS FALLS GENTLY
BEHIND THE MOWER."

00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:29,397
ANDY, I WOULD SAY
YOUR PRESENTATION

00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:32,267
MET WITH LIMITED SUCCESS.
(Robert laughs)

00:27:32,267 --> 00:27:34,335
I DON'T CARE IF YOU GUYS
AREN'T ECO‐PEOPLE.

00:27:34,335 --> 00:27:38,039
YOU KNOW, THERE'S A WHOLE
SECTION OF AMERICA‐‐
OH, NOBODY'S MORE ECO
THAN ME.

00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:41,042
THAT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.
ANDY, ANOTHER PIECE
OF ADVICE‐‐

00:27:41,042 --> 00:27:43,344
DON'T INSULT THE PEOPLE
YOU'RE ASKING MONEY FROM.

00:27:43,344 --> 00:27:45,747
NEVER A GOOD APPROACH.

00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:48,082
I THINK WE'RE ALL ECO,
UH, CONSCIOUS HERE.

00:27:48,082 --> 00:27:51,219
(Kevin) ALL RIGHT.
GOOD LUCK TO YOU.
(mouths words)

00:27:53,855 --> 00:27:56,391
WE'RE GONNA ELIMINATE
EMISSIONS

00:27:56,391 --> 00:27:58,927
BY SELLING WHAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
SELLING FOR YEARS,

00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,162
EVEN BEFORE EMISSIONS STARTED.

00:28:01,162 --> 00:28:03,531
I DIDN'T LIKE THAT "OH, WELL,
YOU'RE NOT ECO‐FRIENDLY"

00:28:03,531 --> 00:28:06,434
BECAUSE I DON'T BUY YOUR THING.
THAT WASN'T COOL.

00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:09,237
THAT WAS HIM MAKING AN EXCUSE
FOR HIMSELF.

00:28:09,237 --> 00:28:12,240
YEAH, I KINDA LIKED HIM UP TILL
THAT POINT. LIKE, REALLY?
THE NEXT TIME
ONE OF THE SHARKS,

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,576
UH, WAKES UP IN THE MORNING‐‐
THE EARLY MORNING‐‐

00:28:14,576 --> 00:28:16,578
TO THE SOUND
OF HIS NEIGHBOR'S LAWN MOWER,

00:28:16,578 --> 00:28:20,215
HE'S REALLY GONNA BE WISHING
HE HAD THEM USING ECOMOWERS.

MY NAME IS DAVID PIKOFF,
AND THIS IS MY BROTHER STUART.
WE'RE FROM AUSTIN, TEXAS.

00:28:35,997 --> 00:28:38,533
TOGETHER, WE'RE
THE COFOUNDERS OF GAMES2U.
SO THERE WAS A POINT

00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:41,169
AT WHICH I WAS PUTTING TOGETHER
MY SON'S BIRTHDAY PARTY AT HOME,

00:28:41,169 --> 00:28:43,738
AND I REALIZED THERE WAS
NOTHING NEW SINCE WE WERE KIDS.

00:28:43,738 --> 00:28:45,373
IT WAS BOUNCE HOUSES,

00:28:45,373 --> 00:28:47,342
PETTING ZOOS, MAGICIANS‐‐
ALL THAT SAME OLD BORING STUFF,

00:28:47,342 --> 00:28:49,344
SO WE SET OUT
TO CHANGE ALL THAT.

00:28:49,344 --> 00:28:51,746
WE HAVE THE MOST UNIQUE
MOBILE ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY

00:28:51,746 --> 00:28:54,415
ON THE PLANET. ONE OF THE BIG
REASONS WHY IS THE MAGIC

00:28:54,415 --> 00:28:56,551
THAT HAPPENS RIGHT HERE
IN THE FUN FACTORY.

00:28:56,551 --> 00:28:59,420
COME ON. I'LL SHOW YOU.

00:29:03,157 --> 00:29:05,426
HIT IT, BOYS.
(laughs) HERE WE GO.

00:29:05,426 --> 00:29:07,428
(David) WE ARE THE FIRST

00:29:07,428 --> 00:29:10,431
AND ONLY MOBILE ENTERTAINMENT
COMPANY OF ITS KIND.
(Stuart) BASICALLY,

00:29:10,431 --> 00:29:13,434
WE BRING THE COOLEST STUFF TO
YOUR DOORSTEP.
AAH!

00:29:13,434 --> 00:29:15,937
NO! OH, MY GOD!
THIS IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT

00:29:15,937 --> 00:29:19,340
FROM ANYTHING WE'VE DONE, TOO.
THAT'S GREAT.
YOU KNOW, WORKING TOGETHER
AS BROTHERS IS A LOT OF FUN.

00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,342
I'VE KNOWN THE GUY
MY WHOLE LIFE.

00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:24,345
AND I DO ALL THE HARD WORK,
HE TAKES ALL THE CREDIT.

00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:27,582
YEAH. AND IF THINGS DON'T
WORK OUT, I JUST TELL MOM.

00:29:27,582 --> 00:29:30,385
(children screaming)

00:29:30,385 --> 00:29:33,988
(children laughing)
THE FIRST EVENT,
THE KIDS CAME UP TO US.

00:29:33,988 --> 00:29:36,491
THEY WERE HUGGING OUR LEGS
AND TELLING US IT WAS

00:29:36,491 --> 00:29:38,660
THE GREATEST DAY
OF THEIR LIFE,

00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,863
AND AT THAT POINT, WE KNEW
WE WERE ON TO SOMETHING.
GAMES2U HAS OVER
140 FRANCHISE TERRITORIES

00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,865
ACROSS THE COUNTRY NOW.

00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:46,334
FRANCHISEES ARE THRIVING,
DOING FANTASTIC.

00:29:46,334 --> 00:29:49,704
THIS IS A PERFECT OPPORTUNITY
FOR THE SHARKS TO COME IN

00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:53,341
AND INVEST
IN AN AMAZING, GROWING BRAND.

00:30:31,512 --> 00:30:35,049
(David, normal voice) MY BROTHER
AND I ARE KIDS AT HEART.

00:30:35,049 --> 00:30:37,352
THREE YEARS AGO,
WE STARTED GAMES2U,

00:30:37,352 --> 00:30:39,854
THE FIRST AND ONLY
NATIONALLY BRANDED

00:30:39,854 --> 00:30:41,856
MOBILE ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY
OF ITS KIND.

00:30:41,856 --> 00:30:44,425
GAMES2U HAS
SPECIALIZED VEHICLES.

00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:46,427
INSIDE OF OUR VEHICLES,

00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:49,364
WE'VE GOT 4‐D MOVIE THEATERS
AND MOBILE VIDEO GAME THEATERS.

00:30:49,364 --> 00:30:52,066
WE HAVE ALL KINDS
OF OTHER CRAZY, FUN STUFF‐‐

00:30:52,066 --> 00:30:54,736
THINGS LIKE BOOGER WARS.
YES, BOOGER WARS.

00:30:54,736 --> 00:30:58,506
AND Ubot,
WHERE YOU BECOME THE ROBOT.

00:30:58,506 --> 00:31:01,342
NOW OUR COMPANY IS SET UP
AS A FRANCHISING ORGANIZATION.

00:31:01,342 --> 00:31:02,944
TODAY WE HAVE

00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:06,881
OVER 140 FRANCHISE TERRITORIES
SOLD IN 28 STATES,

00:31:06,881 --> 00:31:10,818
AND WE DO OVER 2,000 PARTIES
AND EVENTS EACH AND EVERY MONTH.

00:31:10,818 --> 00:31:15,056
ANYBODY WANT TO TAKE A SPIN
IN THE Ubot?
YEAH, I'LL TAKE IT.
HOW DOES IT WORK?

00:31:15,056 --> 00:31:17,258
HOP ON IN. IT'S GOT
AN ADJUSTABLE PLATFORM,

00:31:17,258 --> 00:31:20,762
SO IT ADJUSTS
TO ANY HEIGHT, AND‐‐
ARE YOU CALLING ME SHORT?

00:31:20,762 --> 00:31:23,765
(laughs) NO.
<i>(robotic voice)</i>
<i>HOW DO I TALK INTO IT?</i>

00:31:23,765 --> 00:31:26,768
(laughs)
AND WHEN YOU TALK, IT'S GOT
VOICE MODULATION, AS YOU SEE.

00:31:26,768 --> 00:31:29,670
(normal voice)
OH, IT'S EASY TO USE.
THE ARMS ALSO SHOOT NERF BALLS,
SO EVERYBODY DUCK.

00:31:37,512 --> 00:31:40,515
WELL DONE. WELL DONE.
(normal voice) I LIKE IT. IT'S
FUN. DID YOU GUYS MAKE THIS?

00:31:40,515 --> 00:31:43,217
WE DID.
IT'S A PATENTED PRODUCT.
YOU INVENTED THIS,
THIS WHOLE THING?

00:31:43,217 --> 00:31:47,055
YES, SIR.
WOW. IT KINDA REMINDS ME
OF DAYMOND‐‐SHORT, STOCKY.

00:31:47,055 --> 00:31:49,390
(laughs)
LITTLE BIT.

00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:51,392
SO LET ME ASK YOU THIS,
STUART.

00:31:51,392 --> 00:31:54,362
I ASK YOU TO COME TO MY HOUSE
FOR MY KID'S BIRTHDAY.

00:31:54,362 --> 00:31:57,165
WHAT DOES THAT COST?
TYPICAL EVENT AT A HOME BIRTHDAY
PARTY IS GONNA BE $300 TO $400.

00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,533
IT'S JUST GONNA BE

00:31:58,533 --> 00:32:01,169
ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF OF
ENTERTAINMENT BY THE FRANCHISE.

00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,404
THE MORE LUCRATIVE BUSINESS
THE FRANCHISES HAVE

00:32:03,404 --> 00:32:05,773
IS THE CORPORATE‐‐
CORPORATE TEAM‐BUILDING EVENTS,

00:32:05,773 --> 00:32:09,544
THE SCHOOL FUND‐RAISERS.
SO WHAT‐‐WHAT DOES THAT COST
A CORPORATION TO HIRE YOU?

00:32:09,544 --> 00:32:12,580
THEY'RE GONNA SPEND UP TO A FEW
THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR AN EVENT.

00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,582
YOU PUT
A VALUE OF YOUR BUSINESS

00:32:14,582 --> 00:32:16,751
BY ASKING ME
FOR $500,000 FOR 10%.

00:32:16,751 --> 00:32:20,521
YOU'RE TELLING ME
IT'S WORTH $5 MILLION.
YES, SIR.

00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:23,658
OKAY. HUMOR ME. YOU'D BETTER
HAVE SOME FANTASTIC SALES.

00:32:23,658 --> 00:32:26,494
(laughs) AND WE DO.
LAST YEAR WE DID

00:32:26,494 --> 00:32:30,264
$3.5 MILLION IN GROSS SALES.
THIS YEAR WE'RE UP 65%.

00:32:30,264 --> 00:32:33,267
WE'RE TRACKING FOR $5 MILLION
IN TOP LINE SALES.
MM.

00:32:33,267 --> 00:32:35,770
I REALLY WANNA KNOW
WHAT BOOGER WARS IS.

00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:38,272
(chuckles)
BOOGER WARS IS A GREAT GAME.

00:32:38,272 --> 00:32:41,275
IT'S BASICALLY A CROSS BETWEEN
CAPTURE THE FLAG AND DODGEBALL.

00:32:41,275 --> 00:32:43,878
IF YOU GET BOOGERED,
YOU'RE OUT.
HOW DOES IT WORK?

00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:46,681
WELL, YOU'VE GOT
THESE VESTS OVER HERE.

00:32:46,681 --> 00:32:49,383
BOOGERS GET THROWN. THEY STICK,
YOU'RE BOOGERED, YOU'RE OUT.
(rips Velcro)

00:32:49,383 --> 00:32:52,487
IT'S A SIMPLE GAME,
BUT IT IS A TON OF FUN.

00:32:52,487 --> 00:32:55,890
IS THIS
ONE OF YOUR CREATIONS?
IT IS.
IT'S A PATENTED PRODUCT.

00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,992
PATENTED PRODUCT.
SO IF WE INVEST
IN THE COMPANY,

00:32:57,992 --> 00:33:00,361
ARE WE OWNERS ON
ALL THE PATENTS AS WELL?

00:33:00,361 --> 00:33:02,997
ABSOLUTELY. WE HAVE
SIX PATENTS CURRENTLY...
WE HAVE TEN TRADEMARKS.

00:33:02,997 --> 00:33:05,533
AND GAMES2U HAS
SO MANY DIFFERENT PRODUCTS.

00:33:05,533 --> 00:33:07,435
YOU'RE LOOKING
AT JUST A FEW HERE TODAY.

00:33:07,435 --> 00:33:09,437
WE'VE GOT A LOT
OF OTHER UNIQUE PRODUCTS.

00:33:09,437 --> 00:33:12,373
WE'RE ALWAYS GONNA BE
CREATING NEW THINGS.

00:33:12,373 --> 00:33:13,875
WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT‐‐

00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:15,877
OUR FRANCHISEES ARE
WILDLY SUCCESSFUL.

00:33:15,877 --> 00:33:18,446
WILDLY SUCCESSFUL FRANCHISEES
COUPLED WITH

00:33:18,446 --> 00:33:20,448
HUGE CONSUMER DEMAND‐‐THAT'S
WHAT MAKES A WINNING FORMULA

00:33:20,448 --> 00:33:22,583
FOR A FRANCHISING ORGANIZATION,
AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE.

00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,252
DAVID,
YOUR REVE‐‐YOUR SALES‐‐

00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:27,522
ARE THEY <i>YOUR</i> SALES,
INCLUDING THE FRANCHISEE SALES?

00:33:27,522 --> 00:33:31,325
NO, SIR. THOSE ARE PURELY
OUR SALES. CORPORATE.
SO WHAT I'M ASKING YOU IS,

00:33:31,325 --> 00:33:33,427
YOU SELL THE LICENSE
TO THE FRANCHISEES,

00:33:33,427 --> 00:33:35,429
AND THEY SELL
THEIR OWN STUFF?

00:33:35,429 --> 00:33:37,431
CORRECT.
RIGHT. A FRANCHISEE‐‐
WHEN THEY INVEST,

00:33:37,431 --> 00:33:40,768
THEY GET A PROTECTED TERRITORY.
THEY GET A SPECIALIZED VEHICLE

00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:44,539
LIKE YOU SEE. THEY GET
A VAST ARRAY OF OUR EQUIPMENT.
(O'Leary) LET'S WALK THROUGH
THE FRANCHISEE MODEL.

00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:46,340
I CALL YOU UP

00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:49,343
FROM DES MOINES, IOWA.
WHAT DO I PAY YOU?
APPROXIMATELY $150,000.

00:33:49,343 --> 00:33:53,014
AND WHAT DO I PAY ONGOING?
6% ROYALTY
WITH A $1,000 MINIMUM.

00:33:53,014 --> 00:33:54,749
PER MONTH?
PER MONTH, CORRECT.

00:33:54,749 --> 00:33:57,318
HAS ANY FRANCHISEE FAILED?

00:33:57,318 --> 00:33:59,754
ABSOLUTELY. WE HAVE
A FEW FAILURES IN THE SYSTEM,

00:33:59,754 --> 00:34:02,390
AS ANY FRANCHISE SYSTEM DOES,
BUT OURS ARE MINISCULE.

00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:05,359
OKAY, LET'S‐‐LET'S GIVE YOU
THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT,

00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:08,329
AND LET'S GO BACK TO THE VALUE,
'CAUSE IN THE END,

00:34:08,329 --> 00:34:11,399
IT'S JUST ABOUT MONEY. LOVE
KIDS, BUT THIS IS ABOUT MONEY.
WERE YOU MAKING MONEY?

00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:13,401
YES, SIR.
WE WERE PROFITABLE
LAST YEAR.

00:34:13,401 --> 00:34:17,338
WHAT DID YOU MAKE
AFTER TAXES?
LAST YEAR WE NETTED $125,000
ON JUST OVER $3 MILLION.

00:34:17,338 --> 00:34:20,341
AND YOU WANT ME TO PAY YOU
$5 MILLION FOR THAT?

00:34:20,341 --> 00:34:23,344
BECAUSE, AGAIN, THIS IS NOT
A SHORT‐TERM PLAY FOR US.

00:34:23,344 --> 00:34:25,947
WE HAVE BUILT OUT
AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CAN

00:34:25,947 --> 00:34:29,083
SUPPORT A SYSTEM FIVE TO TEN
TIMES THE SIZE OF THIS COMPANY.

00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:31,185
BUT YOU'RE VALUATING IT
AT $5 MILLION.

00:34:31,185 --> 00:34:34,188
CORRECT.
OKAY, BUT WHY WAS THE PROFIT SO
LOW? IT DOESN'T ADD UP FOR ME.

00:34:34,188 --> 00:34:37,191
THE INITIAL MILLION DOLLARS THAT
A HANDFUL OF ANGEL INVESTORS

00:34:37,191 --> 00:34:39,694
AND US PUT INTO THIS COMPANY
WAS TO GET IT TO THIS POINT.

00:34:39,694 --> 00:34:42,330
WE'RE
AT THE TIPPING POINT NOW.
(Robert) SO YOU TOOK
OUTSIDE MONEY IN.

00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,765
(Stuart) CORRECT.
YOU TOOK A MILLION DOLLARS
IN CASH.

00:34:44,765 --> 00:34:47,001
(Stuart and David) CORRECT.
YOU'RE ASKING
FOR A MULTIPLE.

00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:49,704
YES, SIR.
A MULTIPLIER OF VALUE,
LET'S CALL IT THAT.

00:34:49,704 --> 00:34:53,507
YOU'RE MAKING $125,000
FREE CASH. YOU WANT $5 MILLION.

00:34:53,507 --> 00:34:54,875
THAT'S MY PROBLEM.

00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:57,878
LOVE THE KIDS, LOVE THE BOOGERS,
LOVE THE BLASTING MASTER,

00:34:57,878 --> 00:35:00,081
WHATEVER,
BUT THIS IS ABOUT MONEY.
RIGHT.

00:35:00,081 --> 00:35:02,183
I THINK THIS IS
A REAL BUSINESS.

00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,585
I THINK
THE REAL FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE IS‐‐
IT'S THE NUMBER.

00:35:04,585 --> 00:35:07,388
(Stuart) WE WERE THE 21st
FASTEST‐GROWING FRANCHISE

00:35:07,388 --> 00:35:10,558
LAST YEAR IN THE COUNTRY.
WE LAUNCHED THIS BUSINESS

00:35:10,558 --> 00:35:13,861
IN THE WORST ECONOMY
THE U. S. HAS EVER SEEN.
BUT WHY WOULD YOU COME HERE
WITH A NUMBER LIKE THAT?

00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:15,997
YOU‐‐YOU‐‐YOU BASICALLY SAY THAT
YOU NEED STRATEGIC PARTNERS.
MM‐HMM.

00:35:15,997 --> 00:35:18,933
WE DO.
BUT YOU WANT TO OVERCHARGE US
AND THEN PUT US TO WORK?

00:35:18,933 --> 00:35:21,502
WHAT IS IT YOU THINK IS
REASONABLE?

00:35:21,502 --> 00:35:25,006
WELL, MY TIME ALONE TO WORK
ON THIS PROJECT IS WORTH

00:35:25,006 --> 00:35:28,442
THE WHOLE COMPANY.
AND YOU'RE TAKING ALL
THE PATENTS INTO CONSIDERATION?

00:35:28,442 --> 00:35:31,212
EVERYTHING! EVERYTHING
COMES HOME TO DADDY.

00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,347
DAVID, THE PROBLEM IS,
THE ECONOMY'S REALLY HARD.

00:35:33,347 --> 00:35:36,350
YES, SIR.
I BUY THE DEVELOPMENT COST
THAT YOU'RE PUTTING IN,

00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:38,319
BUT $125,000‐‐

00:35:38,319 --> 00:35:42,490
REALLY, THE‐‐THE BUSINESS,
ON A PURE MONEY BASIS,

00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:45,326
ISN'T WORTH ANYWHERE CLOSE
TO $5 MILLION.

00:35:45,326 --> 00:35:48,362
I CAN'T GET OVER THE NUMBER,
AND I CAN'T GET OVER THE FACT

00:35:48,362 --> 00:35:51,365
THAT IF I HAVE TO LAY OUT
A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS

00:35:51,365 --> 00:35:54,035
OF MY HARD‐EARNED MONEY
AND ONLY GET 10%,

00:35:54,035 --> 00:35:56,404
AND THEN I HAVE TO GO
TO WORK,

00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,373
THE NUMBER JUST DOESN'T
WORK FOR ME. I'M OUT.

00:35:59,373 --> 00:36:02,443
MY OWN FEELING ON THIS IS,

00:36:02,443 --> 00:36:04,445
IF YOU HAVE TO CONSTANTLY
CREATE NEW PRODUCT,

00:36:04,445 --> 00:36:06,714
WHICH IS EXPENSIVE TO DO,
THERE'S NO WAY

00:36:06,714 --> 00:36:09,650
YOU'RE GONNA GET AHEAD
OF THE BALL HERE, SO I'M OUT.

00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:12,653
HEY, I ADMIRE YOU. YOU'VE MADE
MONEY OFF OF BOOGERS.

00:36:12,653 --> 00:36:15,323
I'VE MADE 'EM
OFF OF FART JOKES.
(Barbara laughs)

00:36:15,323 --> 00:36:18,359
I'M NOT THROWING
ANY DARTS THERE.

00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:21,362
I THINK TO SHELL OUT 400 BUCKS
FOR A KID'S BIRTHDAY PARTY,

00:36:21,362 --> 00:36:24,365
IN THIS ECONOMY, I MEAN, IT'S‐‐
IT'S AN EXTRA WHEN PEOPLE ARE

00:36:24,365 --> 00:36:27,902
STRUGGLING TO PAY THE MORTGAGE
OR BUY GROCERIES, AND‐‐
(David) BUT IF YOU THINK
ABOUT IT, IN THIS DAY AND AGE,

00:36:27,902 --> 00:36:31,272
SOMEBODY MIGHT NOT GET THAT
NEW CAR, THEY MIGHT NOT GET

00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,941
THAT NEW HOUSE OR TAKE
THAT VACATION, BUT THEY'RE NOT

00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:36,877
GONNA CHEAT THEIR KID
OUT OF A BIRTHDAY PARTY.
SURE THEY ARE, IF THEY CAN'T
AFFORD THEIR MORTGAGE.

00:36:36,877 --> 00:36:39,513
NO, NO.
MY DAD USED TO TURN ON
THE SPRINKLER...

00:36:39,513 --> 00:36:42,149
(Daymond) YEAH. YEAH.
AND TELL US IT WAS
A WATER PARK. I MEAN...

00:36:42,149 --> 00:36:45,386
(sharks laugh)
I THINK IT JUST TAKES TOO LONG
TO EVER GET YOUR MONEY BACK,

00:36:45,386 --> 00:36:47,154
SO GOOD LUCK TO YOU.

00:36:47,154 --> 00:36:51,092
I HOPE YOU MAKE A BILLION,
BUT I'M OUT.

00:36:51,092 --> 00:36:53,661
DAVID, IT'S NOT WORTH
$5 MILLION. YOU KNOW THAT.

00:36:53,661 --> 00:36:55,730
I UNDERSTAND,
BUT WE'RE NEGOTIABLE.

00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,765
BUT TO COME OUT HERE

00:36:57,765 --> 00:37:00,601
AND ASK ME TO VALUE THIS
AT $5 MILLION...

00:37:00,601 --> 00:37:03,604
YOU KNOW,
IT'S ALMOST AN INSULT.

00:37:05,539 --> 00:37:06,907
(Robert) MY ISSUE IS,

00:37:06,907 --> 00:37:10,211
YOU CAN'T CONTINUE TO MAKE MONEY
UNLESS YOU DEVELOP NEW PRODUCT,

00:37:10,211 --> 00:37:12,580
WHICH IS A SUNK COST FOR YOU

00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:15,049
THAT YOU CAN'T GET BACK
FROM THE FRANCHISEES.

00:37:15,049 --> 00:37:17,418
I HAVE AN ISSUE
WITH THAT MODEL.

00:37:17,418 --> 00:37:20,721
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.

00:37:20,721 --> 00:37:23,357
<i>FOUR SHARKS ARE OUT.</i>
<i>KEVIN IS THE LAST CHANCE</i>

00:37:23,357 --> 00:37:25,393
<i>FOR THE PIKOFF BROTHERS</i>
<i>TO SEAL A DEAL.</i>

00:37:25,393 --> 00:37:28,329
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER, OKAY?
LET'S START WITH THIS.

00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,698
I'M GONNA BE REALISTIC
AND DEAL IN THE REAL WORLD.

00:37:30,698 --> 00:37:32,700
YOU'RE OFF IN THE FANTASY LAND
WITH THE ROBOT.

00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,702
I'M BACK HERE ON EARTH.

00:37:34,702 --> 00:37:38,205
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
A FULL PREMIUM ON THIS THING

00:37:38,205 --> 00:37:40,207
AND SAY IT'S WORTH
A MILLION BUCKS.

00:37:40,207 --> 00:37:43,344
HOWEVER, I NEED CONTROL, SO I'M
GONNA GIVE YOU $500,000 FOR 51%.

00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,446
WELL, THAT'S NOT SOMETHING
THAT WE COULD JUSTIFY

00:37:45,446 --> 00:37:47,448
THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO US.

00:37:47,448 --> 00:37:49,817
YOU ONLY MADE $125,000.

00:37:49,817 --> 00:37:52,920
TODAY WE HAVE
A MASSIVE CONSUMER DEMAND.

00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,056
WE HAVE A 99.9%
CUSTOMER SATISFACTION RATING.

00:37:56,056 --> 00:37:58,058
WE HAVE SUCCESSFUL FRANCHISEES
THAT ARE EXPANDING.

00:37:58,058 --> 00:38:01,162
WE HAVE A BUSINESS MODEL THAT
WORKS ON A CORPORATE LEVEL

00:38:01,162 --> 00:38:04,165
THAT'S PROFITABLE.
YOU KNOW, IF YOU BLINDFOLDED ME
RIGHT NOW, THAT'S THE SAME PITCH

00:38:04,165 --> 00:38:06,167
I GOT ALL MORNING FROM
TEN GUYS. SAME STORY‐‐

00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:09,270
"THE FUTURE'S SO BRIGHT, I GOTTA
WEAR SHADES, AND I GOT A ROBOT."

00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:12,506
ALL YOU GOT IS
$125,000 CASH.

00:38:12,506 --> 00:38:14,942
THAT'S THE ONLY THING
THAT'S <i>REAL</i> TO ME.

00:38:14,942 --> 00:38:17,044
STUART, WHAT'S
YOUR COUNTER TO HIM?

00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:19,413
IS THAT THE ONLY OFFER
ON THE TABLE?

00:38:22,516 --> 00:38:25,653
(O'Leary) I LOOKED
AT YOUR $125,000 OF CASH

00:38:25,653 --> 00:38:28,355
THAT YOU GENERATED,
ALL RIGHT?

00:38:28,355 --> 00:38:31,158
I GAVE YOU
A GENEROUS MULTIPLIER ON THAT

00:38:31,158 --> 00:38:33,527
THAT TOOK THE VALUE
OF THIS BUSINESS,

00:38:33,527 --> 00:38:36,664
NOT TO THE $5 MILLION
THAT <i>YOU</i> WANTED,

00:38:36,664 --> 00:38:39,166
BUT TO THE $1 MILLION
THAT IT'S WORTH.

00:38:39,166 --> 00:38:42,736
AND SO I'M WILLING TO GIVE
YOU $500,000 FOR 51%,

00:38:42,736 --> 00:38:46,106
BECAUSE YOU ACTUALLY NEED ME
TO HELP YOU.

00:38:47,508 --> 00:38:50,110
LISTEN, IT'S TIME
TO MAKE A DECISION.

00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:53,080

THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN GIVE UP

IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE

00:39:37,324 --> 00:39:39,527
WELL, NOT

00:39:39,527 --> 00:39:43,030

SO WHY DON'T WE GO BACK

00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:45,399
IF WE WANT TO DO A DEAL
WITH HIM,

00:39:45,399 --> 00:39:47,401
THAT'S PROBABLY
WHAT IT WOULD TAKE.

00:39:47,401 --> 00:39:49,403
I STILL THINK
IT'S A CHEAP DEAL,

00:39:49,403 --> 00:39:53,040
BUT IT'S PROBABLY WHAT IT WOULD
TAKE TO CLOSE A DEAL WITH HIM.

00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,509
$500,000, 25%,
AND THAT'S IT?
THAT'S IT.

LET'S GO.

00:40:03,717 --> 00:40:06,186
WELL, YOU'RE
A BRILLIANT BUSINESSMAN.

00:40:06,186 --> 00:40:08,188
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
ALSO HUMBLE.

00:40:08,188 --> 00:40:11,025

00:40:11,025 --> 00:40:12,393

WE WOULD LOVE

00:40:14,395 --> 00:40:16,497
WE THINK YOU COULD BE
VERY STRATEGIC FOR US.

00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:19,533
A CONTROLLING POSITION
IN OUR COMPANY

00:40:19,533 --> 00:40:22,403
IS NOT SOMETHING WE'RE ABLE
OR WILLING TO DO.

00:40:22,403 --> 00:40:25,239
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO US
ON ANY LEVEL. HOWEVER‐‐

00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:27,608
WHY?
BECAUSE WE HAVE
A PROVEN TRACK RECORD.

00:40:27,608 --> 00:40:29,610
WE HAVE
A PROVEN BUSINESS MODEL.

00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:32,580
WE HAVE SUCCESSFUL FRANCHISEES,
AND WE HAVE HAPPY CONSUMERS.

00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,582
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING,
MY FRIEND,

00:40:34,582 --> 00:40:37,551
IF I GAVE YOU $500,000
OF MY OWN MONEY,

00:40:37,551 --> 00:40:41,021
WOULD I BE YOUR SINGLE
LARGEST SHAREHOLDER TODAY?
YES.

00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:43,757
WHY SHOULDN'T I HAVE CONTROL?

00:40:43,757 --> 00:40:46,393
MONEY <i>ALWAYS</i> CONTROLS
EVERYTHING ALL OF THE TIME.

00:40:46,393 --> 00:40:47,761
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.

00:40:47,761 --> 00:40:49,763
IF YOU'D BE WILLING
TO BE A PARTNER

00:40:49,763 --> 00:40:52,766
WITH A 25% EQUITY STAKE
FOR A $500,000 INVESTMENT,

00:40:52,766 --> 00:40:56,537
WE'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU
ON THE TEAM.

00:40:59,406 --> 00:41:02,509
I CAN'T GET THERE.

00:41:02,509 --> 00:41:04,878
I HAVE TO GO WITH MY GUT

00:41:04,878 --> 00:41:07,514
AND WHAT THE VALUE
OF THIS BUSINESS IS,

00:41:07,514 --> 00:41:10,484
AND THE ONLY THING THAT SPEAKS
TO ME IS MONEY. THAT'S IT.

00:41:10,484 --> 00:41:12,920
I HAVE A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP
WITH IT.

00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,656
I'M A GREAT PARTNER
BECAUSE OF THAT.

00:41:15,656 --> 00:41:18,392
I HAVE TO HAVE 51%.
YOU GET A CHECK FOR $500,000.

00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:20,394
WE MARCH OFF
IN THE FUTURE.

00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:23,430
WE BLAST EVERYBODY
WITH NERF BALLS.
(Stuart and David laugh)

00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:25,432
COME ON, GUYS.
BE REALISTIC.

00:41:25,432 --> 00:41:28,369
YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T GET
ANY MONEY FROM A BANK.

00:41:28,369 --> 00:41:31,372
LET'S BE HONEST
WITH EACH OTHER.
OUR DECISION REALLY IS NOT
MONEY FROM A BANK.

00:41:31,372 --> 00:41:34,375
IT'S A REASONABLE VALUATION THAT
WE CAN GET COMFORTABLE WITH

00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:36,343
VERSUS CONTINUED ORGANIC GROWTH.

00:41:36,343 --> 00:41:39,346
I THINK WE'RE DONE.

00:41:39,346 --> 00:41:40,514
YOU SAID NO.

00:41:40,514 --> 00:41:43,083
YOU LEAVE THE TANK,
WE DON'T MAKE A DEAL‐‐

00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:45,486
IT'S LIKE A MEMORY WIPE.
(imitates whoosh)

00:41:45,486 --> 00:41:46,854
'CAUSE THERE'S ANOTHER GUY,

00:41:46,854 --> 00:41:49,323
ANOTHER ROBOT, ANOTHER STORY,
ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY,

00:41:49,323 --> 00:41:52,092
AND I <i>WILL</i> GIVE THEM THE MONEY,
AND THEY WILL BECOME RICH.

00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:55,062
IT WON'T BE A BRAND
LIKE GAMES2U.

THERE'S A MILLION STORIES
LIKE YOURS, MY FRIENDS.

00:41:57,731 --> 00:41:59,833
THAT'S WHY BEING AN ENTREPRENEUR
IS SO WONDERFUL.

00:41:59,833 --> 00:42:03,404
EVERY DAY I OPEN THE DOOR,
AND THERE'S A NEW OPPORTUNITY.

00:42:03,404 --> 00:42:06,407
TWO GUYS WITH A ROBOT.
GOOD LUCK TO YOU.
THANK YOU.

00:42:06,407 --> 00:42:10,244
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
(Robert) THANKS, GUYS.

00:42:10,244 --> 00:42:12,880
(Stuart) THERE WAS NO WAY
WE WERE WILLING TO GIVE UP

00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,849
51% OF OUR COMPANY AND CONTROL
TO SOMEONE LIKE KEVIN O'LEARY.

00:42:15,849 --> 00:42:17,851
HE DOESN'T HAVE‐‐
HE DOESN'T SEE OUR VISION.

00:42:17,851 --> 00:42:19,853
HE DOESN'T SEE
WHERE THIS COMPANY CAN GO

00:42:19,853 --> 00:42:21,488
AND UNDERSTAND
THE POSSIBILITIES.

00:42:21,488 --> 00:42:23,490
IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE
TO GIVE UP CONTROL

00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:24,925
TO SOMEBODY LIKE THAT.

00:42:24,925 --> 00:42:27,928
THEY REALLY SHOULD'VE DONE
THE DEAL.
THEY JUST WERE GREEDY.

00:42:27,928 --> 00:42:30,164
I SHOULD OWN THIS ROBOT.
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

00:42:30,164 --> 00:42:32,032
YOU LOOK LIKE THE ROBOT.

00:42:32,032 --> 00:42:34,668
<i>(robotic voice)</i>
<i>ROBERT, I'M GOING TO KILL YOU.</i>

00:42:34,668 --> 00:42:37,004
(laughs)

00:42:37,004 --> 00:42:38,405
<i>(cackles)</i>

00:42:38,405 --> 00:42:40,708
<i>GEE, THIS IS FUN.</i>

00:42:40,708 --> 00:42:43,243
<i>HOW MUCH IS THIS AGAIN‐‐</i>
<i>A MILLION BUCKS?</i>

00:42:43,243 --> 00:42:45,279
<i>YOU KNOW, MAYBE I'LL JUST</i>
<i>BUY ONE OF THESE.</i>

00:42:45,279 --> 00:42:46,680
<i>EVERYBODY'S GOING TO DIE.</i>

00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,382
(sharks laugh)
