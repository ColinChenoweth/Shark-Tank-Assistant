00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,382
WITH MY FAMILY
AND MY LOVING CAT SAMANTHA.

00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:58,552
A FEW YEARS AGO,
WE WERE LIVING

IN A TINY APARTMENT
IN MANHATTAN.

00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:03,423

WALKED IN OUR FRONT DOOR,

00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:05,993
YOU KNEW WE HAD A CAT.
YOU COULD SMELL THE LITTER BOX

00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,595
NO MATTER HOW OFTEN
WE CLEANED IT.

00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,697

OLD CATS CAN LEARN NEW TRICKS.

00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,664
MY CAT WAS 11
WHEN I TOILET‐TRAINED HER.

00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:27,200
I DID SOME RESEARCH‐‐
HOW DO YOU TOILET‐TRAIN A CAT?

00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,703
IN A MATTER OF WEEKS,
SAMANTHA WAS USING THE TOILET,

00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:33,573
THE LITTER BOX WAS GONE,
WE WERE SAVING MONEY. IT WORKS.
OKAY, WALK ME THROUGH
HOW YOU TRAINED SAMANTHA.

00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:36,943
YOU SAID, "SAMANTHA, YOU CAN'T
POOP IN THE LITTER ANYMORE."

00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,113
OKAY, SO THE REASON
A CAT USES A LITTER BOX

00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,116
IS BECAUSE IT IS THE OPTION
WE GIVE THEM TO COVER THE S‐‐

00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,786
THE SMELL OR THE SCENT
OF THEIR WASTE FROM PREDATORS.

00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:49,689
TO AVOID BEING TORN TO SHREDS
BY A LARGER ANIMAL.
EXACTLY. SO WHEN
YOU TOILET‐TRAIN THEM,

00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,858
WHEN YOU GET TO THE POINT WHERE
YOUR CAT IS ACTUALLY PERCHING

00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,860
AND THEY'RE GOING THE BATHROOM
IN THE WATER OF THE TOI‐‐

00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,663
THAT'S WHEN THEY REALIZE
THAT THE WATER OF THE TOILET

00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:59,466
COVERS THE SCENT BETTER
THAN KITTY LITTER, AND IT'S JUST

00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,868
A GRADUAL TRANSITION
FROM LITTER BOX TO TOILET.

00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:04,671
YOU TAKE THE CitiKitty TRAINING
SEAT THAT YOU SEE THERE,

00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,474
YOU PUT IN ON YOUR TOILET,
AND YOU FILL IT WITH

00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:10,277
A SMALL AMOUNT OF KITTY LITTER.
YOU NEED A SPECIAL SEAT?

00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:13,480
THAT'S WHAT CitiKitty IS.
SO THIS IS YOUR REGULAR TOILET.

00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,782
YOU LIFT IT UP, TAKE IT OFF.
(Barbara) OH.

00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:18,084

YOU REMOVE THE FIRST RING

FROM THE TRAINING SEAT,
THAT'S IN ITS CENTER.

00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,856
IT WILL MAKE A SMALL HOLE
IN THE TRAINING SEAT.

00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:24,858
IT'S ABOUT THAT BIG.
YOUR CAT WILL CONTINUE

00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,993
TO GO TO THE BATHROOM IN
THE LITTER OF THE TRAINING SEAT.

00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,496
THE SAME THING AT RING TWO‐‐
YOU'RE MAKING THE HOLE LARGER.

00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,499
AND AT THE THIRD RING,
THAT'S WHEN THEY'LL START

00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:33,867
AIMING IN THE WATER
OF THE TOILET,

00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:37,137
AND THAT'S WHEN THE CAT REALIZES
THE WATER OF THE TOILET

00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:41,141
COVERS THE SCENT OF THE WASTE
BETTER THAN KITTY LITTER.
I'LL BET IT'LL BE GREAT
TO BE THERE FOR THAT.

00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:44,044
THE CAT ACTUALLY LOOKS DOWN IN
THE BOWL AND SAYS, "OH, WATER."
YEAH.

00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:47,814
"OH, I'M GOOD."
"I'M GOOD. I'M NOT GONNA BE
TORN TO SHREDS BY A PREDATOR."

00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:51,451
YEAH. YEAH.
WHAT IF I HAVE TO GO
TO THE TOILET AFTER THE KITTY?

00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:54,454
JUST LIFT THE TOILET SEAT UP,
TAKE IT OFF, AND SET IT ASIDE,

00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,990
AND THEN YOU PUT IT BACK ON‐‐
DURING THE TRAINING.

00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,293
THAT'S ONLY FOR A FEW WEEKS.
DURING THE TRAINING,
DO THEY MISS THE SEAT AT TIMES?

00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:04,197
I'M NOT SURE I'D SHARE MY TOILET
WITH MY CAT.
YOU'RE SO SELFISH, BARBARA.

00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,868
YEAH.
NO, NO. I JUST WONDER
IF THEY ARE ACCURATE.

00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,637
THEY ARE VERY ACCURATE. PEOPLE
SAY, "OH, I DON'T WANT TO SHARE

00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,939
MY TOILET SEAT WITH‐‐WITH
MY CAT." THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,941
OH, THAT'S DISGUSTING.

00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:18,378
NO, WHAT'S DISGUSTING IS HAVING
YOUR CAT USE A LITTER BOX.

00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,814
LET'S NOT FORGET
THIS IS A BOX OF POOP,

00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:23,250
AND YOUR CAT IS GOING
TO THE BATHROOM IN THERE,

00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,252
AND THEN THEY'RE WALKING
IN YOUR HOUSE,

00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:27,721
THEY'RE WALKING ON YOUR SOFA,
YOUR KITCHEN COUNTER.
THIS IS SO CRAZY.

00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,190
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER‐‐
OKAY, IF YOU DON'T HAVE CATS,

00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,926
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
(O'Leary and Barbara laugh)

00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:36,463

REBECCA,
I LOOK FOR TWO THINGS‐‐

00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,439
I LOOK FOR A‐A PRODUCT
THAT SOLVES A PROBLEM

00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,441
AND A MASS‐MARKET PRODUCT,

00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:31,277
AND I THINK THIS MEETS
BOTH OF THOSE.

00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:34,781
EVERY PET STORE IN AMERICA
WILL WANT THIS PRODUCT

00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:37,250
IF YOU PUT THIS ON TV.
THAT'S WHAT I DO,

00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,352
AND I'M INTERESTED
IN THIS DEAL.

00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,354
SO I WOULD GIVE YOU
THE $100,000,

00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:45,425
BUT I WOULD NEED
40% OF THE COMPANY.

00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,032
UM, I'D LIKE TO HEAR
ALL THE OTHER OFFERS

00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,667
BEFORE... COUNTERING.

00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:59,572
WHO SAID
THERE'S ANY OTHER OFFERS?

00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:05,311
UM, I WAS ON THE FENCE.
I THINK THAT THERE'S PROBABLY

00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:08,281
A BETTER OFFER
WITH A BETTER STRATEGIC PARTNER,

00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,350
SO I'M GONNA BE OUT.

00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,618
OKAY.

00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:13,620
REBECCA, I HAVE AN OFFER
ON THE TABLE.

00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,689
LET'S GET
TO THE BOTTOM LINE HERE.
NO, WAIT JUST A MINUTE.

00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,494
OBVIOUSLY KEVIN'S A GREAT GUY
TO PUT IT ON TV.

00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,797
THE DOWNSIDE TO HIS OFFER IS,
IS IT COSTS

00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:25,999
A LOT OF MONEY
TO MAKE A TV COMMERCIAL.

00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:28,902
IT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY
TO BUY THE AIRTIME.

00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,904
I DON'T THINK $100,000 IS
GONNA DO IT.

00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:34,274
SO YOU REALLY NEED A PARTNER
IN THE TV BUSINESS,

00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:37,777
AND MY PARTNER IN NEW YORK OWNS
THE BIGGEST TV BUSINESS

00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:40,547
CALLED "AS SEEN ON TV,"
SO I'LL GIVE YOU THE $100,000

00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:43,950
FOR ONLY THE 15% IF YOU'RE
WILLING TO TAKE THE CHANCE

00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,586
THAT HE BUYS IN
ON PUTTING IT ON TV.

00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,122

SHE'S SAYING
ONLY IF HER FRIEND LIKES IT

00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,928
VERSUS HARRINGTON, WHO'S SAYING
HE WANTS TO DO A DEAL.

00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,996
IT'S A RISK DEAL.

00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:59,766
REBECCA, I AM THE TV EXPERT

00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,135
IN THE PANEL HERE. OKAY?
YES.

00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:05,138
SHE HAS TO GO TO SOMEBODY THAT
MAY LIKE IT, MAY NOT LIKE IT.

00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:08,408
YOU'RE HERE TO DO A DEAL.

I SUSPECT VERY MUCH
HE'LL LIKE IT,

00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:14,047
BECAUSE THE ONLY CRITERIA HE HAS

WITH CERTAINTY, YOU HAVE
TO GIVE UP 40% EQUITY

00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:23,323

00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,147
I JUST NEED THE CONTACTS,
THE DOORS TO BE OPEN,

00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,049
THE PROPER FINANCIAL INJECTION

00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,953
TO REPOSITION THE BRAND
AND GROW IT FURTHER.

00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:36,822
LET'S START
WITH THE SALES NUMBERS.
(Robert) YEAH.

00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,792
LAST YEAR I DID $90,000
IN SALES. I'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS

00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:42,295
FOR 6 YEARS. I'VE DONE
A TOTAL OF $1.4 MILLION

00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:44,096
OUT OF MY BASEMENT.

00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:47,466
SO HAVE YOUR SALES GONE UP
AND THEN STARTED DROPPING?

00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:50,269
YES.
SO WHAT WERE THE SALES
AT THEIR PEAK?

00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:53,172
$400,000.
AND THEY DROPPED TO $90,000?

00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:55,875
MM‐HMM.
HOW MUCH DO YOU SELL THESE FOR?

00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,877
UH, THEY RANGE.
THE TANK TOPS ARE

00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:59,745
ANYWHERE BETWEEN $38 AND $42.

00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:04,283
THE LONG SLEEVES ARE
ANYWHERE BETWEEN $55 AND $60.

00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:07,353
CAN YOU STOP ANYBODY ELSE
FROM PUTTING THIS ON A T‐SHIRT?

00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:09,989
I HAVE A TRADEMARK ON "DUE IN."

00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:12,391
THE WORDS "DUE IN"‐‐
NO ONE ELSE COULD USE?

00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:15,328
"DUE"‐‐WHEN I LAUNCHED
THE LINE BACK IN '04,

00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:18,097
I GOT TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF
PRESS, CELEBRITY RECOGNITION.

00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,601
JENNIFER GARNER, ANGELINA JOLIE,
BRITNEY SPEARS.

00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:24,303
KIM, YOU'RE A T‐SHIRT COMPANY.
THE OBJECTIVE IS

00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:27,306
TO SELL MORE T‐SHIRTS, MAKE MORE
MONEY. WE ALL AGREE ON THAT.

00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:30,743
YEAH. RIGHT.
YOU HAVE PICKED A SUBSEGMENT
OF A SUBSEGMENT.

00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:33,045
IN OTHER WORDS,
I CAN'T SELL TO MEN.

00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:35,147
THAT'S 50% OF THE MARKET GONE...
SURE.

00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,550
BUT I CAN'T SELL
TO ALL WOMEN EITHER.

00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,553
I CAN ONLY SELL
TO THE PREGNANT ONES. THAT'S IT.
6 MILLION.

00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:43,022
OKAY, BUT I'M SAYING
IT'S VERY HARD

00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:46,058
TO GET TO MY TARGET MARKET
BECAUSE THEY TEND TO BE PREGNANT

00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:49,895
FOR ONLY NINE MONTHS.
(Robert) I LIKE THAT APPROACH.
I LIKE THE FACT

00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:53,833
THAT YOU FOUND
A VERY NICHE MARKET.
THE BEAUTY
OF THE MATERNITY MARKET IS

00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,469
YOU HAVE A NEW CUSTOMER
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,205
WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE.
WHEN YOU'RE PREGNANT,

00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:02,708
YOUR OLD CLOTHES DON'T FIT.
YOU'RE A FORCED CUSTOMER.
YES.

00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,578
MY ISSUE IS NOT THE MARKET.

00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:08,381
MY ISSUE IS YOU WERE HOT
A FEW YEARS AGO.

00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:13,252
YOU'RE SAYING
SHE'S NOT HOT NOW?
KEVIN, MY MIND IS NOT
IN THE GUTTER LIKE YOURS.

00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:15,454
OH.
I'M SIMPLY TALKING ABOUT
HER BUSINESS.

00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:17,323
SHE IS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN,

00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,392
OF COURSE,
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE IMPLYING.

00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:21,927
BUT YOU HIT SALES OF $400,000,
RECESSION HIT,

00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:25,398
AND THEN YOU KIND OF HIT BOTTOM.
CAN YOU BE HOT TWICE?

00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:27,867
CAN THAT BABY BE BORN AGAIN?

00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:29,268
ABSOLUTELY.

00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,871
I KNOW I CAN DO IT AGAIN
BECAUSE, I MEAN,

00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:36,275
THIS IS‐‐THIS TOOK A GREAT DEAL
OF THOUGHT IN DEVELOPING.

00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,344
A LOT OF THE MATERNITY T‐SHIRTS
OUT THERE‐‐

00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:41,180
THEY'RE NOT FLATTERING
TO WOMEN.

00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,684
THEY'RE NOT MAKING THEM
LOOK BEAUTIFUL AND SEXY.

00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:48,521
WHEN I LAUNCHED THE LINE, IT WAS
ABOUT ESTABLISHING A BRAND AND‐‐
WELL, HOW DO YOU THINK
YOU'VE DONE THERE?

00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,357
I'VE NEVER HEARD
OF SAMSON MARTIN.
WELL, YOU'RE NOT PREGNANT.

00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:54,827
I KNOW, BUT THAT'S MY PROBLEM‐‐
I CAN ONLY SELL IT

00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:57,830
TO PEOPLE THAT ARE PREGNANT.
(Barbara) YOU SAID
YOU WANTED REPOSITIONING.

00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,399
THAT MEANS YOU WANT TO MAKE
A CHEAPER‐PRICED BRAND?

00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:03,436
YES.
THEN LET'S SAY YOU DO.
THEN WHAT DO YOU DO WITH

00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:05,104
THAT CHEAPER T‐SHIRT?

00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:07,406
I TAKE IT
TO A LARGER RETAILER.

00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:11,477
I CAN'T RELY ON
THESE SMALLER BOUTIQUES TO‐‐

00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:13,779
FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH,
I CAN'T DO IT.

00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,948
I'M THINKING TARGET.
I'M THINKING JCPenney,

00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:19,752
I'M THINKING KOHL'S.
I'M THINKING buybuy BABY.
(Daymond) HAVE YOU TALKED
TO THEM?

00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:22,054
I HAVE NOT.
(Robert) WHY?

00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:25,124
I DON'T HAVE
THE PROPER CONTACTS.
YOU BUILT A BUSINESS.
YOU'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS

00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:28,127
FOR ALL THIS TIME.
YOU DON'T HAVE THE PROPER...
YEAH.

00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:30,896
YOU CAN'T PICK UP A PHONE
AND MAKE A CALL?

00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:34,633
I HAVE MADE PHONE CALLS.
I HAVE NOT...
(Barbara) CONNECTED.

00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,368
YOU WANT $50,000.
YES.

00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:39,238
WHAT‐‐WHERE YOU GONNA GO
WITH THAT?

00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,240
THE MONEY WOULD BE
FOR MARKETING, PRODUCTION,

00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,877
MANUFACTURING, AND TO
ESSENTIALLY FILL THE ORDERS.

00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:47,546
YOU WOULD BE SPENDING THE MONEY
ON DEVELOPING

00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:49,548
THIS NEW PRODUCT LINE...
YES.

00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:52,585
FROM‐‐FROM SCRATCH, REALLY.

00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,253
YES. BUT IT‐‐

00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:58,257
DAYMOND, YOU'RE A BRAND GUY.
HOW HARD OR EASY IS IT

00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,725
TO TAKE A BRAND

00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:02,995
THAT'S DECLINING
AND MAKE IT HOT AGAIN?

00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:06,866
A LOT OF THE CUSTOMERS NOW ARE
NOT BUYING AS MANY CLOTHES.

00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:09,468
THE WOMEN'S BUSINESS IS
INCREASINGLY HARD AT THE MOMENT.

00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:12,538
AND GETTING TO THOSE GUYS
SHE'S ASKING ABOUT GETTING TO‐‐

00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:15,374
<i>EVERYBODY'S</i> TRYING TO GET TO
THEM. I'M TALKING KNOWN BRANDS

00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,376
THAT ARE DOING $4 BILLION
AND $5 BILLION.

00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:20,246
THE BIG BRANDS THAT WE ALL KNOW
ARE TRYING TO GET SOME BECAUSE

00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:21,781
THEY'RE STUCK ON INVENTORY

00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:25,117
AND THEY HAVE TO OFFLOAD IT.
SO...
WELL, YOU'RE MR. POSITIVE.

00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:28,087
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE BRAND
HAS SUFFERED DUE TO THE FACT

00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:29,822
THAT THE COMPANY'S

00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:32,525
NOT HOT ITSELF.
THIS IS JUST THE ENVIRONMENT.

00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:36,061
SO I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
THAT I'M OUT.

00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:38,531
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
MY THOUGHTS, TOO.

00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:41,634
I DON'T LIKE
HOW MANY DIFFERENT SKEWS

00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,803
YOU NEED TO CARRY IN INVENTORY.

00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,205
YOU GOT MONTHS,
YOU'VE GOT VARIOUS COLORS.

00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:48,941
YOU'VE GOT SIZES,
YOU GOT THIS, YOU GOT THAT.

00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:51,443
I MEAN, YOU PROBABLY GOT 30
OR 40 DIFFERENT VERSIONS

00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:55,147
OF THIS PRODUCT. THAT‐‐THAT'S
WHERE I'M COMING FROM.
OKAY.

00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,483
IT'S‐‐IT'S TOO CONFUSING OF
A BUSINESS FOR ME, SO I‐I'M OUT.

00:21:57,483 --> 00:22:01,187
KIM, THERE'S A LOT OF PREGNANT
WOMEN IN NEW YORK CITY,

00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:02,755
WHERE I LIVE...
MM‐HMM.

00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:04,723
RUNNING AROUND
IN PREGNANCY T‐SHIRTS.
MM‐HMM.

00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:08,294
BUT THEY SIMPLY HAVE A MONTH.
IT DOESN'T SAY "DUE IN."

00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:11,297
AND IN SOME WAYS, JUST SEEING
A "JANUARY" OR "MARCH,"

00:22:11,297 --> 00:22:14,166
FOR ME, FEELS
A LITTLE BIT MORE CLEVER...
MM‐HMM.

00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,169
THAN BEING SO LITERATE
AS "DUE IN MARCH."

00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,238
YEAH, WELL,
THEY TOOK MY IDEA.

00:22:19,238 --> 00:22:21,240
(chuckles) THEY DID.

00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:26,912
I'M NOT SOLD IN THE VALUE
OF THE "DUE IN" PART OF IT,

00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:28,881
SO I'M OUT.

00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:32,551
YOU KNOW, KIM,
YOU'RE STARTING UPHILL AGAIN.

00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:34,587
I'M NOT SURE I WANT TO BE THERE

00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:37,723
TO, UH, FIGHT THAT BATTLE
WITH YOU. I'M OUT.

00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:43,863
GIVE ME ONE REASON
THAT I SHOULD GIVE YOU $50,000.

00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:48,534
BECAUSE I'VE DONE
$1.4 MILLION IN SALES

00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:51,670
IN MY BASEMENT, ON MY OWN‐‐
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
FOR ME LATELY?

00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,740
WHO CARES ABOUT THE PAST?
WHAT ABOUT RIGHT NOW? IT‐‐

00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,109
UH, I‐I BELIEVE
THAT THIS BRAND

00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,511
AND THE ACTUAL PRODUCT IS
A WINNER.

00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:01,647
I'M STUCK
ON THIS SUBSEGMENT PROBLEM

00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:04,183
BECAUSE I CAN SELL T‐SHIRTS
TO 250 MILLION PEOPLE

00:23:04,183 --> 00:23:07,186
OR 6 MILLION PEOPLE.
LET ME THINK ABOUT THAT.
RIGHT.

00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:09,221
HMM. 250,000,000.
BUT‐‐

00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,424
KIM, I GOTTA TELL YOU, THIS IS
THE T‐SHIRT DEAL FROM HELL.

00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:15,194
YOU CAN'T SELL IT TO ANYBODY
EXCEPT PREGNANT WOMEN,

00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:17,696
SALES ARE GOING DOWN,
THE MARKET'S GETTING SOFT,

00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:20,366
PRICE POINTS ARE COMING DOWN.

00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:23,535
I MEAN, I'M TRYING TO FIND
SOMETHING, <i>ANYTHING.</i>

00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:26,538
BUT NO, IT'S ALL DEATH
AND DESTRUCTION IN YOUR STORY.

00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,274
IT'S HORRIBLE. I'M OUT.

00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,510
(Robert) WOW. THAT WAS...

00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,879
WOW.
WOW.

00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:35,414
WOW.
WOW. THAT'S HARSH.

00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,049
WELL, AM I WRONG?

00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:41,120
TALK ABOUT THROWING THE, UH,
BABY WITH THE BATHWATER.

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,189
HE'S NEGATIVE.
DO YOU HAVE ANY DOUBT
I'M TELLING THE TRUTH?

00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:47,393
I DON'T THINK I'M A, YOU KNOW,
A DEATH INVESTMENT.

00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:50,229
BUT I‐I WOULD BE KILLING MONEY
IF I GAVE IT TO YOU.

00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:53,399
I ONLY WORRY ABOUT THE DEATH
OF THE MONEY. THAT'S IT.

00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,037
OKAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:23:58,037 --> 00:24:01,840
WHAT ARE YOU THANKING US FOR?
BECAUSE SHE'S POLITE.
THAT'S WHY.

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,643
BECAUSE I'M A LADY.
(Robert) THAT'S RIGHT.

00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:07,813
YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO THANK
ME FOR THAT INFORMATION, DO YOU?

00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:11,150
NO, BUT WHAT‐‐
W‐WHY ARE YOU, UH...
I'M JUST TRYING TO BE HONEST.
THAT'S IT.

00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:15,054
(Barbara) BUT SHE'S NOT ARGUING.
LEAVE HER ALONE.
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES THE TRUTH IS
THE BEST MEDICINE.

00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:18,724
FINE, KEVIN. ENOUGH.
LET'S GO.
(Robert) SHE'S JUST BEING NICE.

00:24:18,724 --> 00:24:22,227
SHE THANKED YOU
FOR LISTENING TO HER.
SHE WAS‐‐YOU DON'T WANT
TO HEAR THIS.

00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:25,297
(Robert) I THINK IT'S VERY
PROFESSIONAL TO THANK SOMEBODY.
THANK YOU.

00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:28,701
I HATE THE FACT

00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:32,538
WE MAKE PEOPLE FEEL SO BAD.
(O'Leary) YOU KNOW, ROBERT,

00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:35,708
WHAT'S DEPRESSING ABOUT YOU IS
YOU CAN'T DEAL WITH THE TRUTH,

00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:38,110
BECAUSE THE MONEY
WILL NEVER LIE.
KEVIN‐‐

00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:42,014
THAT MONEY IS TELLING ME
THAT THIS IS A LOSER.
KEVIN, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA BELIEVE THIS,

00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:44,950
BUT THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE'S
TRUTHS THAN YOURS IN THE WORLD.

00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:48,087
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE.
THERE'S ONLY ONE TRUTH IN MAKING
MONEY‐‐YOU EITHER MAKE IT

00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:51,256
OR YOU LOSE IT. THAT'S IT.
SHE'S LOSING IT.
(Barbara) OKAY, WE'RE DONE.

00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:54,093
OKAY, TIME OUT, GUYS.
WE'VE BEEN HERE.
SHE MAY RECOVER.

00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:56,161
LET'S GO. TIME OUT.

00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:59,732
(sighs) I DEFINITELY BELIEVE
THAT...

00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:02,701
COMING AT ME, TELLING ME
THAT MY BUSINESS IS DEAD

00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:05,037
AND THAT THIS IS
INVESTMENT SUICIDE

00:25:05,037 --> 00:25:07,906
WAS A LITTLE, UH...

00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:09,908
IT WAS A LITTLE DISRESPECTFUL

00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:12,778
AND A LITTLE UNNECESSARY.

PARTICULARLY MY KIDS.

INSURE YOUR LIFE

FOR THE VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT,

00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:44,576

PRICE OF‐‐OF THE SHOE?

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,923
THE RETAIL FOR THE SHOE

00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,663
COMFORTABLE?

00:35:31,663 --> 00:35:33,665
THEY'RE HEAVEN.
(chuckles)

00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:36,468
CAN I KEEP THEM
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY?
YES. YOU CAN HAVE THEM.

00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:38,737
THANK YOU.
(Robert) HOW DO THEY FEEL?

00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:41,673
(Barbara) LOVELY.
FEEL GOOD?

00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:45,343
OH, MY GOD. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
ONCE PEOPLE TRY IT ON,
THEY BUY IT.

00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:46,845
DOMINIQUE, INTERESTING STORY.

00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:50,148
UM, YOU HAVE A VALUE ON
THIS BUSINESS OF $2.5 MILLION.

00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:53,451
(Robert) BUT SHE HAS SALES,
KEVIN.
WHAT ARE THEY?

00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:55,720
I THINK MY COMPANY'S WORTH
MORE THAN THAT ACTUALLY.

00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,657
I HAVE SALES‐‐
OF COURSE IT IS,
BUT WHY DON'T YOU HUMOR ME?

00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,725
I'M GONNA SURPRISE YOU.
READY?
YEAH.

00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:03,862
I HAVE GROSSED OVER $20 MILLION
IN THE LAST 4 YEARS.

00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:06,431
I'M IN 2,000 STORES
IN OVER 30 COUNTRIES.

00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:08,066
I'VE BEEN ON SEVERAL

00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:10,402
TV SHOPPING CHANNEL NETWORKS
AND BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL.

00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:13,104
WHAT ARE SALES LAST YEAR?
LAST YEAR WAS LOW.
IT WAS $3.5 MILLION.

00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:16,074
I WAS $6 MILLION
THE YEAR BEFORE THAT.
WHERE DO YOU MAKE THIS?
IN CHINA?

00:36:16,074 --> 00:36:19,310
NO. WE MAKE THE MOLDS IN ITALY
FOR THE SHOES, AND THEN I MAKE

00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:22,847
THE TOPS, ACTUALLY,
IN PALM BEACH, FLORIDA.
CAN'T YOU SAVE MONEY
MAKING IT OFFSHORE?

00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,316
THAT'S WHY I WANT
TO GET AN INVESTOR

00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:27,318
BECAUSE I'M NOT A GOOD SOURCER,
AND I WOULD LIKE‐‐

00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:29,754
I HAVE OTHER DESIGNS
FOR MORE COMPLICATED TOPS

00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:32,157
THAT I CANNOT POSSIBLY MAKE
IN PALM BEACH,

00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:35,493
I MEAN, AND HAVE A GOOD MARGIN.
BUT I'M NOT GOOD AT SOURCING.

00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:38,596
WHAT'S THE STATUS OF THE‐‐
THE HOME SHOPPING BUSINESS

00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:42,734
AND, UM, ARE YOU
ON THERE CURRENTLY OR‐‐
UH, I'VE BEEN ON QVC SIX TIMES.

00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:46,271
I HAVE DONE NO ADVERTISING
OR MARKETING.
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN FINANCING
THIS BUSINESS?

00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:48,873
WELL,
I'M REALLY A PHARMACIST.

00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:52,477
I GOT‐‐I DID THIS AS A HOBBY
IN THE BACK OF MY PHARMACY.

00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:54,512
AND I GOT SO BUSY,
AND IT BLEW UP, LIKE,

00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:58,349
PROBABLY THE SECOND YEAR I DID
IT, THAT I MOVED MY PHARMACY

00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:02,120
INTO THE SHOE FACTORY.
WOW. YOU'RE GONNA DO WHAT
IN SALES THIS YEAR?

00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,122
UM, I'M OVER $4 MILLION,
SO I'M NOT SURE.

00:37:04,122 --> 00:37:06,458
AND I'M‐‐I'M GOING OVERSEAS
A LOT THIS YEAR.

00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:09,627
SO I JUST STARTED BRANCHING OUT
INTERNATIONALLY.
AND YOU'RE STILL ACTING
AS A PHARMACIST?

00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:12,564
YES, SIR. I FILL PRESCRIPTIONS
AND FILL SHOE ORDERS, TOO.
(laughs)

00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:15,767
(Robert) DO YOU MAKE ANY MONEY
ON YOUR SALES?

00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:19,604
I MAKE 30% AVERAGE.
PROFITS LAST YEAR
WERE A MILLION DOLLARS?

00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:21,906
OVER A MILLION DOLLARS, YEAH.

00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:25,210
WHY DO YOU NEED THE MONEY? UM...
WELL, BARBARA
SHOULD UNDERSTAND THIS.

00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:28,847
I, UM, DID A REAL ESTATE
INVESTMENT, LIKE THREE YEARS AGO

00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:33,084
IN PALM BEACH, AND IT TIED UP
A LOT OF MY CAPITAL.
DON'T TELL ME
YOU BOUGHT A HOUSE.

00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,920
I BOUGHT A HOUSE ON THE WATER
THERE AND, UM, NOW NOBODY'S‐‐
OUCH.

00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,923
YEAH.
WHAT DOES IT COST TO MAKE THEM
AND WHAT DO YOU SELL THEM FOR?

00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,659
AND THEN HOW DO YOU SELL THEM?
THE SOLE...
DIFFERENT STORES
BUY DIFFERENT WAYS.

00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:43,995
LIKE, THE DEPARTMENT STORE
DID, LIKE, A TRAVEL KIT.

00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:45,997
I HAVE A BAG THAT HAS
THREE SHOES IN ONE,

00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:49,100
SO IT'S, LIKE,
A PACKAGE WITH THREE SHOES.
AND HOW MUCH DOES THAT COST
TO MAKE?

00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,569
THAT COSTS, UM,
$18 FOR‐‐FOR THE 3 TOPS

00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:53,571
AND THE PAIR OF SHOES
AND THE BAG.

00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:57,308
AND THEN HOW MUCH
DO YOU SELL IT TO THE STORE FOR?
$35.

00:37:57,308 --> 00:38:00,278
AND HOW MUCH DOES
THE STORE SELL IT FOR?
$85, $95‐‐AROUND THERE.

00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,413
IT'S ALL PATENTED.
NOBODY CAN COPY THIS?

00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:05,116
I HAVE TWO UTILITY PATENTS
AND TWO DESIGN PATENTS

00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,719
THAT ARE ISSUED AND I HAVE
MORE THAT ARE PENDING.

00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:11,089
AND THEN I'M TRADEMARKED
AND COPYRIGHTED IN 98 COUNTRIES.
WHAT'S YOUR BIGGEST ACCOUNT

00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:13,558
OR THE BIGGEST COMPANY
INTERESTED IN YOUR BRAND?

00:38:13,558 --> 00:38:16,161
UM, WELL, THIS COMPANY IN JAPAN,
THEY WANT 10,000 PAIR

00:38:16,161 --> 00:38:18,730
AND, LIKE, 30,000 TOPS
OF THAT.

00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:21,833
THAT'S, LIKE,
A HALF‐A‐MILLION‐DOLLAR ORDER.
(Daymond) WHAT ABOUT
DOMESTICALLY?

00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:24,135
JCPenney, SO...
OH, WOW.

00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:27,205
I'M REALLY STRUGGLING HERE
BECAUSE THIS IS A REAL BUSINESS.

00:38:27,205 --> 00:38:30,975
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT SOMETIMES.
YEAH, SO IT'S ABOUT
A LACK OF CONFIDENCE

00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:34,012
OF DOING IT ON YOUR OWN.
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A PARTNER.
YEAH. I'M IN ABOVE MY HEAD,
I THINK.

00:38:34,012 --> 00:38:38,016
WHY DO YOU SAY YOU'RE IN OVER
YOUR HEAD. YOU SAID THAT‐‐
'CAUSE I'M A PHARMACIST.
I'VE NEVER HAD A BUSINESS CLASS.

00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:41,419
I'VE NEVER HAD
A SHOE DESIGN CLASS. I MEAN...
WHY ARE YOU
SELLING YOURSELF SHORT?

00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:43,454
DO YOU REALIZE
HOW FEW BUSINESSES WE'VE HAD

00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:46,324
COME OUT HERE AND GET
TO YOUR DEGREE OF SALES?

00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,092
AND THEY'RE ALL OVERCONFIDENT.

00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:51,296
(chuckles) I'M ALWAYS‐‐
I'M LIKE A LITTLE TURTLE

00:38:51,296 --> 00:38:54,866
THAT GOES AND TAKES BABY STEPS.
AND I JUST WANT TO WIN.

00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:57,168
I WANT TO MAKE SURE I'M DOING
EVERYTHING PROPERLY.

00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,671
THAT'S WHY I DON'T‐‐
I DON'T TAKE THAT BIG JUMP,

00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:02,507
BUT NOW I'M READY TO GO
TO THE NEXT LEVEL

00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:05,343
AND JUST RAMP IT UP.
DOMINIQUE, IF I WERE TO PUT

00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:09,080
THE HALF A MILLION DOLLARS UP,
WHAT WOULD YOU USE IT FOR?
WELL, WOULD BE MAKE SURE
I COULD FILL THESE BIG ORDERS

00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,082
THAT ARE FIXING TO COME IN.
THEY'RE GOING CRAZY

00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:13,151
IN SWITZERLAND
OVER MY SHOES RIGHT NOW.

00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:15,253
I MEAN, I HAVE PEOPLE FIGHTING
OVER ME IN SAUDI ARABIA.

00:39:15,253 --> 00:39:18,356
I HAVE TWO DIFFERENT
DISTRIBUTORS IN AUSTRALIA

00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,758
AND NEW ZEALAND GOING CRAZY.
I MEAN, IT'S JUST THIS YEAR

00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:24,629
IT WENT INTERNATIONAL, AND IT'S
JUST REALLY OVERWHELMING.

00:39:24,629 --> 00:39:27,966
WHAT A FASCINATING STORY. WOULD
YOU SELL THE WHOLE BUSINESS?

00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:31,202
I DON'T KNOW IF I'D WANT
TO DO THAT. (chuckles)

00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:34,305
ALL RIGHT, I'LL GIVE YOU
$100,000 FOR 10%,

00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:36,774

BUT I DON'T THINK
I NEED ANYBODY ON THIS ONE.

THINK ABOUT IT FOR A SECOND.
SHE DID.

HE WOULD'VE TAKEN ME TO 50%

00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,062
