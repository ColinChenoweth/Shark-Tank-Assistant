00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:03,270
<i>(man) the sharks are back,</i><i>and they're looking for</i>

00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:05,005
<i>the best products</i><i>and Businesses</i>

00:00:05,072 --> 00:00:06,273
<i>America has to offer.</i>

00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,010
The only thing that really
matters--what is it? Money.

00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:12,112
<i>If the sharks hear</i><i>a great idea,</i>

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,948
<i>they're ready to invest,</i><i>using their own money...</i>

00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,051
I think you're smart, slick,
greedy, and it's offensive.

00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:20,187
<i>And fight each other</i><i>for a piece of the action.</i>

00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:22,155
I'll go halves with you,
but no Robert.

00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:23,323
I hate being screwed
on these deals.

00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,958
It's nothing personal,
Robert.

00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,193
No, it is personal,
cuban.

00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,928
Okay, it is,
but I don't care.

00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:30,297
<i>But first, the entrepreneurs</i><i>must convince a shark</i>

00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,299
<i>to invest the full amount</i><i>they're asking for,</i>

00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,935
<i>or they'll walk away</i><i>with Nothing.</i>

00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:37,070
This is a $100--
$500 million company.

00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:38,071
<i>It's sink...</i>

00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:39,072
that's almost an insult.

00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:40,073
<i>Or Swim.</i>

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,942
5% feels offensive to me.

00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:43,277
Would you have taken
5% for facebook?

00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,212
Well Put.

00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:46,413
<i>Who are the sharks?</i>

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,083
<i>They're five self-made,</i><i>filthy rich Investors.</i>

<i>First into the tank</i><i>is Dave Mayer,</i>

00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:43,070
<i>with a new twist</i><i>to a conventional product.</i>

00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,315
Hello, sharks.
My name is Dave Mayer,

00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:58,018
and my company is
clean bottle.

00:01:58,085 --> 00:02:01,088
I'm here today
seeking $60,000

00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:04,224
in exchange for 5%
of the company.

00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:08,395
Like pretty much everyone
these days,

00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,297
I use a water bottle.

00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:11,999
And they're great.

00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,168
You don't have to spend
a fortune on bottled water,

00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:17,004
and it's just the right thing
to do for the environment.

00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:21,041
But these bottles all have
one major problem--

00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:24,945
you can't get to the bottom
of them to clean them out.

00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:26,380
So every two weeks
that go by,

00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,115
I'd open my bottle,
and it looked like

00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:30,017
a science experiment
gone wrong.

00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,419
It's full of mold,
it smelled disgusting.

00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:35,255
The last thing I wanna do
is drink out of this thing.

00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:38,425
So one day, it hit me.

00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:45,399
And that's when I came up
with the clean bottle.

00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:50,370
It's the world's Only bottle
that unscrews from the bottom

00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:53,974
as well as the top.

00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,976
So you can get in there,
clean it out,

00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:59,179
air-dry it so it doesn't
get nasty in the first place,

00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:01,215
and the nozzle comes out,

00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,917
so you can clean that out,
as well.

00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:06,019
So I launched the product
about a year ago.

00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:08,155
And I didn't have a lot
of money to market it,

00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:10,023
so I had to get creative.

00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,260
I went to the biggest
bike race in the world.

00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:16,063
Check out what I did.

00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:20,200
<i>(man) and if you look</i><i>to the side there,</i>

00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:25,005
<i>you'll see a giant bottle</i><i>running alongside... </i>(sharks laughing)

00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:26,206
Oh.
That's fantastic!

00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:27,374
<i>That thing</i><i>is literally everywhere.</i>

00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:29,243
<i>I mean, this guy</i><i>must be exhausted.</i>

00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:32,379
(laughter)

00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:35,015
<i>Look at him waving</i><i>to the fans now--poor Fellow.</i>

00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:36,149
That is great.

00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,418
Talk about
guerilla marketing.

00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,020
Let me show you
the running Holder.

00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:41,154
I know you ran
the New York marathon.

00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,957
A lot of people
run with water, as you know.

00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,993
(Robert) This is
a very clever Idea.
Thank you.

00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:46,994
You got any sales?

00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,262
I launched the product
in may,

00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,063
right before
the Tour de France.
Right.

00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:56,170
Since then, I've sold
$750,000 worth of bottles.

00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,005
How many units is that, Dave?

00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,974
It's about 150,000 units.
(laughs)

00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:04,278
We're in every single
retailer that matters.

00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,013
It's so simple.

00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,949
It's one of those ideas
that--when you showed it to me,

00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:11,218
my first thought was--
of course.

00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:13,320
Why didn't all the bottles
start this way?

00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,960
Your, uh, mascot looks like
he's about 7-foot-18.

00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:21,328
(mark laughs)

00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:23,030
You guys should meet him.

00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,999
I am the clean bottle boy!

00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:29,403
Ride Clean or die!
Are you kidding me?

00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:33,140
Oh! My God!
(mark laughs)

00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:36,043
Champions ride Clean.

00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,178
Losers--they ride dirty.

00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:39,947
Who is that?

00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,315
Bill Walton's, like, one of
the all-time greatest centers

00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,217
in NBA history.

00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,220
How would you get
a superstar like this?

00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,288
I saw him at a--
at a basketball game,

00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:50,224
and I knew that he
was a cyclist.
And you just went up to him?

00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,325
I went up to him.

00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:52,993
You know, nothing ventured,
nothing gained.

00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,962
Bill, are you part
of this deal in some way,

00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,064
other than appearing here today?
No. I'm just a fan,

00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,066
and I'm a user
and I'm a believer.

00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,169
Dave, tell us
the economics, okay?

00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:05,272
You've sold $750,000.
150,000 units.

00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:07,107
That's 5 bucks a pop, right?
That's right.

00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:09,943
Did you make any money
on the $750,000?

00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,279
In the last 12 months,
we made $118,000.

00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:13,947
Why aren't you just
investing that

00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:15,215
so you don't need
$60,000,

00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:17,317
you keep your 5% equity?

00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:20,153
$118,000--we're using
a lot of that money.

00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,989
We're about to take out
the tools

00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,223
for the stainless steel
Bottle.

00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,058
That's $68,000.

00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,327
I need to eat. I have a--
I have a family, two kids,

00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:29,196
and I want
strategic investors.

00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:31,098
Dave, you under--you
understand my skepticism?

00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,200
Great--great Presentation.
Love the tall guy...

00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:37,271
I am the clean bottle boy!
Throw it down, big man!
Throw it down!

00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,072
But it's $60,000!

00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,408
You're asking for $60,000.
(daymond) For 5%!

00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:44,011
You're here to make
one of us work for you,

00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,379
because you're
only offering us 5%.

00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:48,015
You know, I'm--I'm greedy
just like you guys.

00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,917
I don't wanna give away
two arms--cut off two arms

00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,351
when you only have
to cut off one Pinkie.

00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:54,021
$60,000 is 5%.
I'm willing to negotiate.

00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,189
If you guys wanna
go up more,

00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:56,356
if you believe in the product,
you believe in the vision,

00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:59,359
then we can have
that conversation.

00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:01,061
So, Dave, here's what
I think about you--

00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:03,163
I think you're smart,
you're slick,

00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,967
you're greedy,
and it's offensive...

00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,203
and I can't wait to be
your friend and partner.

00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:11,038
All right. Thanks.
Right?

00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,940
But it has to be worth it
for me.

00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:15,275
Now you're offering,
for $60,000, 5%.

00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:18,178
But I would want 25%.

00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:20,948
Okay.

00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:23,250
So I've worked at Goldman Sachs
for two years.

00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:24,384
All I did was valuation.

00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:26,987
That's just
the wrong outcome for me.

00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:29,122
I mean, $60,000 for 25%?
Is that what you said?

00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:32,993
You know what? You know why?
So $240,000 is how
you're valuing the company?

00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,194
I'm not valuing the Company.
Okay.

00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:35,229
I'm valuing my time.

00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:37,397
5% is not enough
for me to get out of bed.

00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:41,034
How much would it take?

00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:42,169
25%.

00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,005
Okay.

00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,107
Are there any other offers?

00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:50,043
I'll give you $100,000
for zero equity

00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,446
and 50 cents of every bottle
you sell in perpetuity.

00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,317
I respect your offer,

00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:59,353
but I think
to siphon off cash

00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,089
at a time when
we're growing the quickest,

00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,992
I don't think you would advise
anyone to do that deal.

00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:10,297
What you need is capital
to buy inventory.

00:07:10,364 --> 00:07:13,033
I'm here not just
for the money.

00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,369
God's honest truth--
I'm here for you guys.

00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,071
It's advice. It's getting
on the phone once a month.

00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:20,040
Let's have some coffee.
Let's talk.

00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:25,078
You know what is such
a turn-off for me in this deal?

00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:28,282
5%. It feels offensive to me.

00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:30,284
Would you have taken
5% for facebook?

00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,187
So don't discount that.

00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:34,288
Well put.

00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:39,226
So, Dave, I'm not offended
by the low percentage ask,

00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:40,961
'cause you're not asking
for a lot of money.

00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:44,398
I think you were dead on
when you valuated Kevin's offer.

00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,400
He's taking cash flow
out of a business,

00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,368
which is like sucking blood
out of a business

00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:51,038
when it's starting out.
I think that's what you do
when you take equity.

00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:53,073
You know you can't do that.
You're stealing his company.

00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,142
Kevin. Daymond is valuing
your entire company

00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:57,277

I'm valuing my time.

00:07:57,344 --> 00:08:00,113
Now, I can--I can
change the offer

00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,315
if you and I
don't have to speak

00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:02,983
and it's just
an investment.

00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,151
That's so disrespectful.

00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:05,352
I mean, the guy's a nice guy.

00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:07,354
Why wouldn't you help
the guy out if you can?

00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:09,389
It's not about helping.
It's about time.

00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:15,028
Here's my offer--
$60,000 for 10%.

00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:16,096
Okay.

00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:19,032
Mark?

00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:23,036

00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:25,339

Your original ask.

00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,393
I mean, I don't own
a basketball team,

00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,062
but I have a lot of connections
in the sports world.

00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,398

00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:31,164
when I make you the <i>exact </i>offer

00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:39,239
The main reason is--
is getting $60,000

00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,208
for a strategic investor.
Don't waste your breath on me.

00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:46,346
You're not strategically
thinking, my friend.

00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:49,449
Your hypersensitive
to the equity you're losing...
Yeah.

00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:51,185

an offer

00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:52,519

Why don't you counter me
with less of a royalty?

00:10:55,589 --> 00:11:01,094

money when I need it the most.

to you--screw you.

00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:15,142
Mark, if you can get down
to my negotiating range,

00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:16,176
what's the difference?

00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:17,311
This is one bottle of wine
for you.

00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:20,514
Don't lose sight of
a couple percent here.

00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:22,049
Let's do this.

00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:24,318
Don't lose sight
of your opportunity.

00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:28,355
Dave, why don't you get on

00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:29,356
I'm making a pitch.

00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:31,491
I'm making
an impassioned plea.

00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:33,527
Mark, let's do this.

00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:39,466
I understand it's only 2%,

00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,502
especially since
it's $60,000.

00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:45,172
But the flip side is,
that if we do our job right,

00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:46,440
that 2% is gonna be worth
a lot of money,

00:11:46,507 --> 00:11:48,075
which is why
you're fighting for it.

00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:49,476
(exhales deeply)

00:11:51,445 --> 00:11:56,149
um, my dad, he's--
he packs all the bottles.

00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,118
Um, I'd like to give him
a quick phone call,

00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:00,020
if you guys don't mind,
and talk about this.

00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:01,288
I'm not going anywhere.
So... All right.

00:12:01,355 --> 00:12:03,290
Don't change anything
while I'm gone, okay?

00:12:03,357 --> 00:12:05,225
(laughs)

00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:08,295
mark, I don't understand
why he's so caught up

00:12:08,362 --> 00:12:10,464
on the extra 1 or 2%.

00:12:10,531 --> 00:12:12,165
Because he knows
what it's gonna be worth.

00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,233
He's greedy.

00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:17,471
So Robert came in
for $60,000 at--at 5%,

00:12:17,538 --> 00:12:19,039
it's exactly what I wanted,

00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:20,440
but then mark came in
at a little bit higher,

00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:23,277
basically $60,000 for 8%.

00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:26,180
Which values the company
at $750,000.

00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:30,050
Um, but I just think that
he's a better strategic partner.

00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:32,519
So I'm gonna try
to talk him down or something.

00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:34,321
I tried it once.
I'm gonna try again.

00:12:34,388 --> 00:12:36,423
But I think he may be
the right guy to go with.

00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,226
(man) Okay,

00:12:39,293 --> 00:12:41,428

to ask you for $100,000

00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,626
for 10% of the company.

00:16:32,693 --> 00:16:34,995
So how about a show of hands--
how many of us are gonna die?

00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:39,600
But how many of us
tell our friends and family

00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,802
exactly what we would want
for our funeral?

00:16:41,869 --> 00:16:43,837
My wonderful life
is a free Web site

00:16:43,904 --> 00:16:46,907
where you can plan
and personalize your own funeral

00:16:46,974 --> 00:16:48,775
so you get the celebration
you want.

00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:50,878
And it takes a huge burden
off of your family.

00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:52,746
We came up with the idea

00:16:52,813 --> 00:16:55,516
after I lost my husband
about five years ago.

00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:57,818
And even though he was sick
for about a year,

00:16:57,885 --> 00:16:58,952
when the time came,

00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,687
we still really didn't know
what he wanted.

00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:01,922
We ended up pulling together

00:17:01,989 --> 00:17:04,658
a really memorable,
really celebratory, uh,

00:17:04,725 --> 00:17:07,661
party in his honor
at one of his favorite bars.

00:17:07,728 --> 00:17:08,862
I had people come up to me
afterwards, saying,

00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:11,598
"how do I make sure I can have
a celebration like that?"

00:17:11,665 --> 00:17:14,768
it was really awesome.
And had he had our site,

00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:15,969
it would have been
so much easier

00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:17,671
for him to let us know
what he wanted.

00:17:17,738 --> 00:17:19,706
When Nancy and I went
online, we found--

00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:21,675
god, there really aren't any
options to do that out there.

00:17:21,742 --> 00:17:24,878
Further Research showed
that 75% of baby boomers,

00:17:24,945 --> 00:17:28,649
like us, really want something
far more celebratory--

00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,751
we don't want the funeral
our parents had.

00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:33,854
The death rate is gonna double
over the next 30 years.

00:17:33,921 --> 00:17:36,623
I mean, what a huge
business opportunity that is.

00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,593
So let us show you
how it works.

00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,597
Okay, Well, Kevin, since you are
Mr. Wonderful, of course...

00:17:43,664 --> 00:17:44,765
that's so True.
It is so True.

00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:45,999
So of course,
we have to talk

00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,734
about the wonderful life
of Kevin O'Leary.

00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:48,902
You basically go online,

00:17:48,969 --> 00:17:50,938
you fill out an online book,

00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:53,740
and inside are all the options
that you can have

00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:56,743
in terms of, you know, where do
you want your funeral to be?

00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,545
What kind of wine
do you want to have?

00:17:58,612 --> 00:18:00,547
Cabernet? I mean--
and--and really,

00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:01,915
do you want to prepay
for your funeral?

00:18:01,982 --> 00:18:03,851
I mean, that's something
that we know

00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,552
you would want to do
for Sure.

00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:08,522
Then what you do is
you designate up to six people--

00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:09,556
could be your fellow sharks--

00:18:09,623 --> 00:18:12,659
who are going to
carry out your wishes.

00:18:12,726 --> 00:18:14,661
They just Click on a Link,
and they get a summary

00:18:14,728 --> 00:18:17,598
of everything you would have
wanted for your funeral.

00:18:17,664 --> 00:18:19,766
It's an $11 billion
industry...
$11 Billion.

00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,001
And we're gonna
lead the way.

00:18:21,068 --> 00:18:22,936
So who's gonna join us?

00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:26,907
I love the DEAD guy Business.
(Sue and Nancy Laugh)

00:18:26,974 --> 00:18:28,609
For the very reasons
you've identified--

00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:29,676
Everybody's gonna bite it.

00:18:29,743 --> 00:18:31,979
So what's the plan
that you make money?

00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:34,648
We're very, very excited
because we have just partnered

00:18:34,715 --> 00:18:36,617
with one of the largest
insurance companies

00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:38,652
in the country,
and we have developed,

00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:41,588
uh, a product called
the my wonderful life plan.

00:18:41,655 --> 00:18:43,891
And so people can set aside
any amount of money

00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,659
to prepay
for their funeral.

00:18:45,726 --> 00:18:47,694
It's basically like buying
an insurance policy.

00:18:47,761 --> 00:18:49,863
So when you die,
your loved ones--

00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,899
all they have to do
is print out the summary.

00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,902
On the summary, it says,
"Kevin's paid for his funeral.

00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,771
Here's where you can
access the money."
So does the money go to you?

00:18:57,838 --> 00:18:59,706
We make a commission
on every sale.

00:18:59,773 --> 00:19:02,743
Oh, I see.
So we're making about 5%
on every sale.

00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:06,613
What's a typical sale?
If you were to put away $5,000
for your funeral,

00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,849
we would make $250 on that.

00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,517
Who does the money come from?

00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:11,885
The money comes from
the insurance company,

00:19:11,952 --> 00:19:13,554
and they hold the money,

00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,689
and that money continues
to earn interest for them.

00:19:15,756 --> 00:19:18,592
How many users
do you have today?
We have 7,000 today.

00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:20,994
How long has the site been up?
It's been up three years.

00:19:21,061 --> 00:19:24,665
What did you gross?
We actually have not
made any money to date.

00:19:25,933 --> 00:19:27,801
The problem I see
with your business model

00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:30,904
is a very small fraction
of the people

00:19:30,971 --> 00:19:33,807
actually preplan
their funeral.

00:19:33,874 --> 00:19:35,709
Well, is that True?
Yeah, it's True.

00:19:35,776 --> 00:19:37,644
That is actually not True.
That is not True.

00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:38,946
What--what percentage?
If you look at, um,

00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:40,614
just funeral planning
in general,

00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:44,551
25% of the people over 50
prepay in some--

00:19:44,618 --> 00:19:46,620
but they do it with
the individual funeral home.

00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:47,955
A lot of us don't wanna
go through a funeral home.

00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,890
You can go through
a funeral home

00:19:49,957 --> 00:19:51,592
to be cremated or whatever,

00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:53,527
but you may just want
to have a great party,

00:19:53,594 --> 00:19:55,562
and that money is put aside
to have a party

00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:57,698
at your favorite place.
I get what you guys
are trying to do.

00:19:57,764 --> 00:20:00,767
Have you signed exclusive deals
with These insurance companies?

00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:01,935
It's not an exclusive deal.

00:20:02,002 --> 00:20:03,670
That's a killer to me.

00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:06,874
(Kevin) Nothing proprietary
about this.

00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,977
Why can't I just set up
uncle Kevin's snuff city?

00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:11,879
What's even worse--

00:20:11,945 --> 00:20:13,914
I can come in and go
to those same companies

00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:15,582
and say, you know what?

00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:16,984
I'll take a little bit less,
but I want an exclusive.

00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,653
And then all of a sudden,
you're stuck.

00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,821
This was an INTERESTING idea

00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:22,890
based on an emotional moment
in your life, Nancy.

00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:24,625
I understand that.

00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:26,793
But as a business plan,
I see all kinds of holes in it.

00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,829
Nothing proprietary about it.

00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:30,831
You're captured by
an insurance company,

00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:32,666
hard to acquire customers,

00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:34,568
competing with
the funeral homes themselves

00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:35,969
that have no interest
in giving you any business.

00:20:36,036 --> 00:20:38,972
We have surveyed
the members that we do have,

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,575
and 40% of them say
they want to prepay.

00:20:41,642 --> 00:20:42,809
So this isn't something that,

00:20:42,876 --> 00:20:44,745
you know, we're just throwing
out there in, you know,

00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:46,813
hopes that people will...
no one saying there's not
a potential business,

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,948
the problem is,
you haven't taken

00:20:48,015 --> 00:20:50,551
a lot of the basic business
steps to protect yourself.

00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:52,553
In all my business,
I always ask myself,

00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:54,855
if I was trying to kick
my own ass, what would I do?

00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:56,690
And those are the things
you haven't done yet.

00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:57,791
Well, and that's why we're here.

00:20:57,858 --> 00:20:58,992
I'm out.

00:21:00,894 --> 00:21:05,933
We have 7,000 members
right now, and bas--
they're paying you nothing.

00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:08,569
Did any of
the 7,000 people die?
Um, yes.

00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:09,903
And what prevented them
from paying at that point?

00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,873
We didn't have that available
at that point.

00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,844
I think that I'll probably be
dead before I see my money back.

00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:17,911
I'm out.

00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,647
But here's the thing, guys.

00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:23,851
If 40%
of our 7,000 members right now

00:21:23,917 --> 00:21:27,554
wanted to put aside--
Let's just say $5,000--

00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:29,723
that--that immediately
generates $700,000.

00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,658
But you haven't tested that.

00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:33,594
If you had tested that model,

00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,896
you've already accumulated
so many dollars in commissions,

00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:38,498
you would have a whole
different presentation here.

00:21:38,565 --> 00:21:40,601
But you're really here
too early.

00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:41,668
I'm out.

00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:47,708
If your investment
is $100,000,

00:21:47,774 --> 00:21:49,910
we'll get 25,000
new members,

00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:52,646
based on a $4-per-member
Acquisition.

00:21:52,713 --> 00:21:54,848
Sue, how do you know that?
Because We've tested it.

00:21:54,915 --> 00:21:56,583
We--we invested
some of our own money

00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,552
to see how much it would cost
to get a member.

00:21:58,619 --> 00:21:59,820
But you didn't monetize them.

00:21:59,887 --> 00:22:02,556
And you didn't
protect it, either.

00:22:02,623 --> 00:22:05,726
Sue, I don't think
you've even, uh,

00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:06,827
gotten out of
the starting gate.

00:22:06,894 --> 00:22:08,729
There's no business.

00:22:08,795 --> 00:22:09,897
I'm out.

00:22:12,566 --> 00:22:13,834
Kevin, come on.

00:22:13,901 --> 00:22:16,837
Kevin.
Oh, you've gotta be kidding.
It really sucked.

00:22:18,772 --> 00:22:19,806
The most interesting
part of your pitch

00:22:19,873 --> 00:22:21,542
is you said,
"Everybody's gonna be dead."

00:22:21,608 --> 00:22:22,876
(singsongy) I'm listening.

00:22:22,943 --> 00:22:25,012
And then you don't tell me how
I make any <i>money </i>from them.

00:22:25,078 --> 00:22:27,548
Come up with a plan that
every guy that dies,

00:22:27,614 --> 00:22:28,949
I make some money.
Then I'm in.

00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:30,918
Aw, Goll.
That's it.

00:22:30,984 --> 00:22:32,753
Well, I don't wanna plan
<i>your </i>funeral, Kevin.

00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:33,754
(laughter)

00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,922
I'm never gonna die.

00:22:34,988 --> 00:22:36,857
I'm a vampire.

00:22:36,924 --> 00:22:38,825
I'm out.

00:22:38,892 --> 00:22:40,861
Aw. All right.
Thanks for your time.
All right.
Thanks for your time.

00:22:40,928 --> 00:22:42,029
Good luck, Ladies.

00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:49,803
Ugh. I hated it.

00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:59,273
You come to us
with the need for a story.

00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:02,342
Our team will organize it,
write it,

00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:05,579
design it, publish it,
and market it--

00:24:05,646 --> 00:24:07,447
one-stop shopping.

00:24:07,514 --> 00:24:10,584
I can see businessghost
becoming the leading provider

00:24:10,651 --> 00:24:13,220
of ghostwritten books
in the United States.

00:24:13,287 --> 00:24:16,423
But I can only make that happen
with your expertise

00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,292
and your capital.

00:24:18,358 --> 00:24:20,594
Who's interested?

00:24:20,661 --> 00:24:24,298
I understand the business model
of one ghostwriter.

00:24:24,364 --> 00:24:26,266
Right.
I'm trying to understand,

00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:28,368
how does that work
on a larger scale?

00:24:28,435 --> 00:24:30,170
Well,
that's a great question.

00:24:30,237 --> 00:24:31,505
The first name of
the company is "Business."

00:24:31,572 --> 00:24:33,340
Most of our clients are
businesspeople,

00:24:33,407 --> 00:24:34,474
are entrepreneurs,

00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:36,476
and there are tens of millions
of businesses

00:24:36,543 --> 00:24:38,111
in the United States.

00:24:38,178 --> 00:24:40,280
Basically, we have
a writing team of eight writers.

00:24:40,347 --> 00:24:42,282
The writers do
the interviewing.

00:24:42,349 --> 00:24:44,484
We have a chief creative OFFICER
Who oversees their work.

00:24:44,551 --> 00:24:46,320
It's my job
to bring in the work.

00:24:46,386 --> 00:24:47,521
How much
do you charge for that?

00:24:47,588 --> 00:24:50,224
We charge anywhere
between $35,000

00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:54,194
and $75,000.
Does that include
a run of the book?

00:24:54,261 --> 00:24:56,463
Yes. That includes the--
the--the printing of the books

00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,298
so that they've got
actual physical books.

00:24:58,365 --> 00:25:00,367
And how many copies
of the hardcover book?

00:25:00,434 --> 00:25:02,402
You get 50 to 100 copies
of the book.

00:25:02,469 --> 00:25:04,371
So how do you acquire
new customers?

00:25:04,438 --> 00:25:07,174
Is it all referral business?
It's mostly referral business

00:25:07,241 --> 00:25:08,375
up to this point, Yes.

00:25:08,442 --> 00:25:10,477
We're averaging about
two books a month right now.

00:25:10,544 --> 00:25:13,413
Honestly, we're doing about
$650,000 to $700,000 gross

00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,481
this year.

00:25:16,383 --> 00:25:19,253
Mike, you've achieved
what every writer never gets--

00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:23,357
profitability.

00:25:23,423 --> 00:25:25,192
But I don't know if this
is a leveragable business.

00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:26,293
I don't know
if you can turn it

00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:30,163
into a $5 million-a-year
business.

00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:33,200
You're basically selling
vanity printing.

00:25:33,267 --> 00:25:35,536
In other words, I'm a guy,
I want a book,

00:25:35,602 --> 00:25:38,272
I can't get a U.S. Publisher
to pick me up,

00:25:38,338 --> 00:25:40,107
I come to you,
you bang out 100 copies,

00:25:40,174 --> 00:25:42,242
costs me 35 grand.

00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:45,279
Yeah. Yeah, I-I cringe
a tiny bit on the inside

00:25:45,345 --> 00:25:46,547
when I hear the word
"Vanity."

00:25:46,613 --> 00:25:48,448
But yes, we are making
a marketing tool

00:25:48,515 --> 00:25:50,551
disguised as a book.
We tell our clients,

00:25:50,617 --> 00:25:53,220
your income stream
is not gonna be revenue

00:25:53,287 --> 00:25:54,454
derived from the sale
of the book.

00:25:54,521 --> 00:25:56,356
Use the book to build
your business.

00:25:56,423 --> 00:25:58,225
Why aren't you interested
in the people

00:25:58,292 --> 00:26:00,294
who wanna write about
their dog and their friend,

00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,129
and the story they had
growing up?

00:26:02,196 --> 00:26:03,564
It may not necessarily 
be business-related.

00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,365
Why are you staying
away from that?

00:26:05,432 --> 00:26:08,468
Because then you open yourself
up to a much bigger market.
Right.

00:26:08,535 --> 00:26:11,271
Right. Daymond--the first thing
I wanna say, daymond,

00:26:11,338 --> 00:26:14,141
is that I-I loved your book,
"display of power."

00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:15,309
I love the way
you suck up.

00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:18,178
You're next. Anyway...
(laughter)

00:26:18,245 --> 00:26:19,279
You're good...

00:26:19,346 --> 00:26:21,348
you like that?
(singsongy) as a schmoozer.

00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:23,250
(laughs)
Where was I? Daymond--

00:26:23,317 --> 00:26:25,352
why aren't you opening up
to the masses?

00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:27,321
You know, it's--
it's about quality.

00:26:27,387 --> 00:26:29,089
It's about the integrity
of the quality.

00:26:29,156 --> 00:26:30,357
I'm putting my name
on every book.

00:26:30,424 --> 00:26:32,492
Not everybody in the country
can afford a book.

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,396
I cannot do a book at $10,000
and make money on it.

00:26:36,463 --> 00:26:38,298
Mike, I've--I've heard
your business model.

00:26:38,365 --> 00:26:41,235
I understand it.
But to scale this business,

00:26:41,301 --> 00:26:42,369
to take it public,
to make it liquid,

00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:44,171
for me to get back
my $200,000,

00:26:44,238 --> 00:26:46,139
regardless of what percentage
of the business I take,

00:26:46,206 --> 00:26:48,509
I see as
a very difficult challenge.

00:26:48,575 --> 00:26:51,345
I don't see how I'm going
to make any money here.

00:26:51,411 --> 00:26:53,247
I'm out.

00:26:54,248 --> 00:26:55,249
Well, in that case,

00:26:55,315 --> 00:26:56,250
I'm not gonna
schmooze you anymore.

00:26:56,316 --> 00:26:58,452
(sharks laugh)

00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:00,554
Oh, I like this guy.
You know, the question
about scalability

00:27:00,621 --> 00:27:02,356
is incredibly important.

00:27:02,422 --> 00:27:06,426
I True--I truly believe that
with somebody other than <i>moi</i>

00:27:06,493 --> 00:27:08,395
running the company...
to do what?

00:27:08,462 --> 00:27:10,197
To do what?
To give
the business direction.

00:27:10,264 --> 00:27:12,499
I'm the classic example
of the entrepreneur

00:27:12,566 --> 00:27:14,301
who has taken something
as far as he can

00:27:14,368 --> 00:27:18,338
and has reached
knucklehead Status.

00:27:18,405 --> 00:27:21,341
Michael, you can't offload
the responsibility

00:27:21,408 --> 00:27:23,410
of coming up
with the right strategy.

00:27:23,477 --> 00:27:27,114
That's where
it falls apart for me.

00:27:27,181 --> 00:27:28,415
The best salesman
in your company,

00:27:28,482 --> 00:27:32,286
the guy who's responsible
for a strategy, has to be you.

00:27:32,352 --> 00:27:33,587
I'm out.

00:27:35,622 --> 00:27:37,124
Okay.

00:27:37,191 --> 00:27:38,258
I-I appreciate that.

00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:41,128
Um, you know,
I-I still think

00:27:41,195 --> 00:27:43,297
that just about anybody
on the planet

00:27:43,363 --> 00:27:45,566
could do a better job
of running my business

00:27:45,632 --> 00:27:48,168
then I--well, that's--that--
that's too self-deprecating.

00:27:48,235 --> 00:27:49,403
I wanna address that
if I could.
Please.

00:27:49,469 --> 00:27:52,472
I've found, in the many
years of experience I have,

00:27:52,539 --> 00:27:55,375
the minute someone Running
any business, large or small,

00:27:55,442 --> 00:27:58,212
starts talking about
getting a C.E.O.,

00:27:58,278 --> 00:28:00,480
It's code for "I'm tired
of my business,

00:28:00,547 --> 00:28:02,216
"and what should really
be happening is

00:28:02,282 --> 00:28:04,384
I should be going
into a different business."

00:28:04,451 --> 00:28:05,552
So I'm out.

00:28:07,654 --> 00:28:10,290
I think if I invested
into this business,

00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:12,125
getting my money back
will end up being

00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:13,393
a mystery book.

00:28:14,461 --> 00:28:15,596
I'm out.

00:28:17,598 --> 00:28:20,400
Well--well stated.
Punch to the Gut.

00:28:20,467 --> 00:28:22,202
Okay.

00:28:22,269 --> 00:28:25,339
Mark, it's, uh,
just the two of us.

00:28:27,341 --> 00:28:30,110
There's a lot that I like
about your business.

00:28:30,177 --> 00:28:33,313
And literally--you, right?
You're a hustler.

00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,449
Where I have
significant problems

00:28:35,516 --> 00:28:39,353
is you didn't really address
the specific changes

00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:40,521
in your industry.

00:28:40,587 --> 00:28:42,489
There's a real
fundamental question as to

00:28:42,556 --> 00:28:45,492
whether or not people will even
publish Books going forward.

00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:48,462
That's exactly right.
I think the book itself

00:28:48,529 --> 00:28:50,397
as a tool of
disseminating information,

00:28:50,464 --> 00:28:54,101
sadly, is all but disappearing
in society.

00:28:54,168 --> 00:28:56,503
And ironically,
in an era when books

00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:59,239
are Harder and Harder
to make money on,

00:28:59,306 --> 00:29:01,408
a business owner who has
one of our books

00:29:01,475 --> 00:29:03,477
is gonna stand out
even more from the crowd

00:29:03,544 --> 00:29:06,313
because there's something
so wonderfully old-school

00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,182
and significant
about a book.

00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:09,550
And that's--that's--
that's my pitch.

00:29:09,616 --> 00:29:12,352
That is the linchpin of
the future of your business?

00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:13,420
That's correct.

00:29:13,487 --> 00:29:16,456
To me, that has
the future potential

00:29:16,523 --> 00:29:20,194
of investing in
a weightlifting snowman.

00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,462
A weightlifting snowman?
You think about that.

00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:26,567

I probably would have invested.

00:31:33,466 --> 00:31:35,769
This scenario happens to people
every night of the week.

00:31:35,835 --> 00:31:38,638
I thought to myself,
there has to be a better way.

00:31:38,705 --> 00:31:40,740
I envisioned a Web site
where people could come,

00:31:40,807 --> 00:31:42,742
view the best events
in any city,

00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:44,411
and prepurchase
their night out.

00:31:44,477 --> 00:31:45,745
What expedia does
for airlines

00:31:45,812 --> 00:31:48,381
or what opentable
does for restaurants--

00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,749
we do that for night life.

00:31:49,816 --> 00:31:51,718
Once you find the exact
events you want to attend,

00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:53,553
you can prepurchase
admission tickets,

00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,821
uh, bottle service.

00:31:54,888 --> 00:31:56,823
I mean, you can even choose
the exact V.I.P. Table

00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:58,758
inside of a venue
that you want to attend.

00:31:58,825 --> 00:32:00,794
Once you select everything,
you make your purchase.

00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,495
That's it, you're done.

00:32:02,562 --> 00:32:04,464
And it doesn't matter if you
do it a day in advance

00:32:04,531 --> 00:32:05,665
or three months in advance.

00:32:05,732 --> 00:32:08,601
You can always opt to have
one of our ez vip reps

00:32:08,668 --> 00:32:10,503
meet you in the front,
walk you in,

00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:11,705
and give you the treatment
you deserve.

00:32:11,771 --> 00:32:14,507
We launched in miami,
which we all know

00:32:14,574 --> 00:32:16,509
is one of the biggest
nightlife markets in the world,

00:32:16,576 --> 00:32:18,478
and right away,
it was a hit.

00:32:18,545 --> 00:32:19,679
So I just have one question
for everyone--

00:32:19,746 --> 00:32:23,450
who wants to be V.I.P.
With me?

00:32:23,516 --> 00:32:24,618
How much money
you making on this?

00:32:24,684 --> 00:32:26,753
Just in miami,
we did $90,000 net.

00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,422
Really?
Gross, we did
a little over $250,000.

00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,658
Impressive.
Just in miami alone.

00:32:31,725 --> 00:32:34,461
What are the levels of
these type of venues?

00:32:34,527 --> 00:32:37,430
Are they high-end?
Luxury?
All high-end. All high-end.

00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,733
With us, it's about having
the top venues in any place.

00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:42,335
So when you come to ez vip,
you can close your eyes

00:32:42,402 --> 00:32:43,570
and point to a venue,

00:32:43,637 --> 00:32:45,438
and you'll wanna be there
for one reason or another.

00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:46,740
If you didn't wanna be there,
they wouldn't be on our site.

00:32:46,806 --> 00:32:48,441
Last time I went to miami,

00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,510
it cost me $130,000
in Champagne.

00:32:50,577 --> 00:32:51,611
I could have called you,

00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:52,812
and you would have
saved me some money?

00:32:52,879 --> 00:32:55,582
I'm so glad
you brought that up.
(laughs)

00:32:55,649 --> 00:32:57,484
Some people came to our site.
They were from out of town--

00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,652
well, actually,
out of the country.

00:32:58,718 --> 00:33:00,353
I think, like, russia
or something like that.

00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,489
They prepurchased their night
to an event, right?

00:33:02,555 --> 00:33:03,590
Two months in advance.

00:33:03,657 --> 00:33:05,659
I think they spent, like,
$1,000 on a table.

00:33:05,725 --> 00:33:07,494
Fast forward
Two months later.

00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,663
A-a big game happened.

00:33:09,729 --> 00:33:13,366
These guys won and they went out
to celebrate that night, okay?

00:33:13,433 --> 00:33:15,368
I happen to have been
there that night

00:33:15,435 --> 00:33:16,803
that my Buddy, uh...
(laughs)

00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,439
Won the nba championship.
I was there. I was there.
I was there.

00:33:19,506 --> 00:33:21,608
Once he went in there,

00:33:21,675 --> 00:33:24,744
the table minimums went to
$20,000, $30,000, $40,000.

00:33:24,811 --> 00:33:25,812
Are you saying that night,

00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:27,714
somebody actually
prebooked with you,

00:33:27,781 --> 00:33:29,449
that person was locked in,

00:33:29,516 --> 00:33:31,518
and the Promoter didn't say,
"you can't come in now.

00:33:31,584 --> 00:33:34,387
I'm getting $10,000"?
Yes. That's exactly
what I'm saying.

00:33:34,454 --> 00:33:36,589
And once a sale goes through,
that sale is final.

00:33:36,656 --> 00:33:38,491
And all of the prices
That's set on the site

00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:41,494
are set beforehand.
I somewhat don't believe it,

00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,830
because they may say, "I'm not
giving this to your people.

00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:46,533
"I can get $5,000 easily here

00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:49,536
and you're gonna try to book out
10 of my--or 20 of my tables"?

00:33:49,602 --> 00:33:50,637
how it works is this--

00:33:50,704 --> 00:33:51,805
say if the venue has
30 tables,

00:33:51,871 --> 00:33:54,407
and they're willing
to presell Ten or five.

00:33:54,474 --> 00:33:56,676
You come to the site, you're
gonna get a list of events--

00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:59,512
only the top events--
and from there you select

00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:00,680
the exact table you want,

00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,716
a picture of that table
comes up,

00:34:02,782 --> 00:34:06,553
you see this table has
a $700 minimum. It seats 6.
And the advantage to the owner

00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,688
is that you're selling it
ahead of time,

00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,423
so they know they got
cash coming in.

00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:12,759
Is it only in miami?
Right now,
we launched in Miami.

00:34:12,826 --> 00:34:15,595
Now we just secured contracts
in L.A., vegas, and new York.

00:34:15,662 --> 00:34:19,532
How do you even know I'm the guy
with the table waiting?

00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,700
The bouncer
has Everyone's name

00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,636
who prepurchased something
that night.

00:34:22,702 --> 00:34:24,704
Listen, daymond is out
every night

00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,439
with At least five Girls
on his arms.

00:34:26,506 --> 00:34:29,342
No, I-I got two Puppies.

00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:32,345
He lives that life, I'm at home
reading a novel every Night.
Yeah.

00:34:32,412 --> 00:34:34,614
So this is a life that
I can't even relate to.

00:34:34,681 --> 00:34:36,850
Yeah.
And for that reason alone,
I'm out.

00:34:39,753 --> 00:34:42,355
Our whole thing
is access and Convenience.

00:34:42,422 --> 00:34:43,723
That's what we push
to our clients.

00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,493
The reason why I started
with Nightclubs and nightlife

00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:48,461
in General is because That's
the market I understand.

00:34:48,528 --> 00:34:51,564
Let me tell you, um,
where I'm at on this deal.

00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:54,567
It's a very interesting, um,
business you've built.

00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,703
I admire your initiative here.

00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:58,438
But I'm sitting at home
with Barbara

00:34:58,505 --> 00:35:01,341
with the dog by the fireplace.
Oh, I'm gonna get sick.

00:35:01,408 --> 00:35:04,511
I'm out.

00:35:04,577 --> 00:35:06,713
I like the idea, right?
Al, I like you.

00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,682
You know, I see the game.
I see what you're trying to do.

00:35:08,748 --> 00:35:10,750
Yeah.
But it's just hard
for me to connect

00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,752
with this type of business.

00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:13,787
And that's why
you have a partner.

00:35:13,853 --> 00:35:15,522
You wouldn't have
to worry about that.

00:35:15,588 --> 00:35:17,390
Well, but I do, right?
Because things I do...

00:35:17,457 --> 00:35:18,591
Yeah.
I like to be
successful at.

00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,360
Yeah.
And I like to kick ass at.

00:35:20,427 --> 00:35:22,662
And I just don't know if I'll
be able to connect enough

00:35:22,729 --> 00:35:23,730
and provide enough time

00:35:23,797 --> 00:35:25,732
to really get you
to the next level.

00:35:25,799 --> 00:35:27,567
So for that reason,
I'm out.

00:35:29,569 --> 00:35:32,572
I love the idea,
but I hate to admit it,

00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:34,574
but I'm a pretty old,
Boring guy.

00:35:34,641 --> 00:35:36,509
I don't really
hang out at nightclubs.

00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:39,613
I'd love to be in on this
if you can get daymond involved.

00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,781
I'll give you the $75,000
if you can get

00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,484
the other $75,000 from daymond.
For what percentage?

00:35:44,551 --> 00:35:46,486
Well, I'm not there yet,
Kevin.

00:35:46,553 --> 00:35:49,689
Now... I've always wanted
to go clubbing with a croatian.

00:35:49,756 --> 00:35:51,558
Always.
(laughter)

00:35:51,625 --> 00:35:52,626
Uh...

00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,429
daymond, you don't go out
'till midnight.

00:35:56,496 --> 00:36:00,400
I'm asleep by 11:00.
And here is my opportunity.
Whoo-whoo!

00:36:00,467 --> 00:36:01,501
right?
(laughs)

00:36:01,568 --> 00:36:03,470
I want 45%.

00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,372
(Kevin) Whoa.

00:36:05,438 --> 00:36:07,440
Robert understands
technology,

00:36:07,507 --> 00:36:09,576
so I would partner up
with Robert.

00:36:09,643 --> 00:36:13,780
So, Robert, if you're okay
with $150,000 for 45%...
I'm in.

00:36:13,847 --> 00:36:16,549
$75,000 from daymond,
$75,000 from me,

00:36:16,616 --> 00:36:20,353
and I promise I will never
be seen in the nightclubs.

00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,688
We want you there.

00:36:21,755 --> 00:36:23,723
For 45%.

00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:25,492
Um, so that's an offer?

00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:27,360
I... I have to
turn that offer down.

00:36:27,427 --> 00:36:29,396
Wow.
Wow, you didn't even
think about it.

00:36:29,462 --> 00:36:30,463
(daymond) Yeah.
(Barbara) Wow.

00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:31,564
This isn't
a $1-million company.

00:36:31,631 --> 00:36:32,632
This isn't a $10 million,
$50 million,

00:36:32,699 --> 00:36:34,668
this is a $100,
$500 million company.

00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,636
So for me to sell 45--
not today. Not today.

00:36:36,703 --> 00:36:38,705
For me to sell--but I
understand where it's going.

00:36:38,772 --> 00:36:40,507
If you would have offered me
that 12 months ago...

00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,342
make a counter.
Maybe we would have had
a conversation.

00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:43,677
Make a counter.
(Barbara) Impressive.

00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,412
18.

00:36:45,478 --> 00:36:47,514
18 what?
18%.

00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,549
Crazy.
(laughs)

00:36:49,616 --> 00:36:50,583
18%.

00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:51,785
I love your confidence.

00:36:51,851 --> 00:36:53,353
See, that's almost
an insult.

00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,754
It's no emotions.
It's just...

00:36:54,821 --> 00:36:57,457
sometimes in negotiations,
when we're so far apart...

00:36:57,524 --> 00:36:58,525
mm-hmm.
It doesn't make any sense.

00:36:58,591 --> 00:36:59,793
I don't wanna waste
your time.

00:36:59,859 --> 00:37:02,629
No. It's no waste of time.
We're talking about money.

00:37:02,696 --> 00:37:03,830
It's never a waste of time.
We're just talking.
I love that.

00:37:03,897 --> 00:37:05,498
So all right. All right.
All right. Check this out.

00:37:05,565 --> 00:37:07,400
I'll--I'll sweeten
it a little bit.
Okay.

00:37:07,467 --> 00:37:08,835
I work with
a lot of artists.

00:37:08,902 --> 00:37:10,570
I work with Pitbull.

00:37:10,637 --> 00:37:12,439
He's one of the biggest
artists in the world.
Ooh!

00:37:12,505 --> 00:37:13,606
I'm going back to the 45,

00:37:13,673 --> 00:37:16,443
but I'll throw in
an artist like pitbull.

00:37:16,509 --> 00:37:18,645
That's a big deal.
A face
behind the brand.

00:37:18,712 --> 00:37:20,747
For 45%.
That's what this is missing.

00:37:20,814 --> 00:37:23,416
Here's what I'll do.

00:37:23,483 --> 00:37:25,418
I'll go halves with you,
but no Robert.

00:37:28,822 --> 00:37:30,690
I hate being screwed
on these deals.

00:37:30,757 --> 00:37:33,493
It's nothing personal, Robert.
No, it <i>is </i>personal, cuban.

00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,662
Okay, it is.
It is, but I don't care.

00:37:35,729 --> 00:37:37,397
(laughs)

00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:38,832
I know you don't care because
you're that kind of guy.

00:37:38,898 --> 00:37:41,568
I mean, you sit there and you
screw us all in the very end.

00:37:41,635 --> 00:37:44,337

screw us all in the very end.

00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,101
I get it.

00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:20,140
So, al, um,
I've decided that....

00:38:20,206 --> 00:38:23,076
We're gonna run over Robert
like a scurvy dog...

00:38:23,143 --> 00:38:24,244
(laughs)

00:38:24,311 --> 00:38:29,316
and cuban and I will offer you
for $150,000 at 45%,

00:38:29,382 --> 00:38:33,253
and I will bring
an a-list artist as a face,

00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,089
and I will take that
out of my share.

00:38:36,156 --> 00:38:39,059
(inhales and exhales deeply)

00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:40,093
and I will be there
to help you with the tech.

00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,127
See what kind of partners
they are?

00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:42,162
They'll throw you
under the bus

00:38:42,228 --> 00:38:43,263
without thinking about it,
my friend.

00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:45,098
They're sharks.
What do you expect? (laughs)

00:38:45,165 --> 00:38:48,935
(Kevin) Just to keep it
interesting in the tank

00:38:49,002 --> 00:38:50,870
and add a little
je ne sais quoi...

00:38:50,937 --> 00:38:52,272
Yeah.
I'm gonna throw out
an offer--

00:38:52,339 --> 00:38:55,909
$150,000 for 25%.
And, you know,

00:38:55,976 --> 00:38:58,244
I'll come and dance with you
once in a while.
(sharks laughs)

00:38:58,311 --> 00:39:00,313
Are you serious, Kevin?
I'm dead serious.

00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,215
That changes a lot, guys.

00:39:02,282 --> 00:39:03,883
Friend,
here's what I'll do.

00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,852
Okay.
I'll go in with Kevin.

00:39:05,919 --> 00:39:09,155
And let me tell you something.
Pitbull is a great artist,

00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:11,157
but there's a lot
of artists out there.

00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:13,293
Mm-hmm.
We can get that same deal.

00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,895
I have absolutely
no doubt in my mind.

00:39:15,962 --> 00:39:17,063
You know what? James Taylor,

00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:21,034
Paul Simon I know
would love this deal.

00:39:21,101 --> 00:39:23,303
Don't even bother with that.
This is just noise.

00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:24,971
So I'll partner with Robert,

00:39:25,038 --> 00:39:29,109
I'll give you $150,000,
$75,000 each, for 25%.

00:39:29,175 --> 00:39:31,144
And we'll provide
technical services...
mm-hmm.

00:39:31,211 --> 00:39:33,980
And financial depth
when you need it.

00:39:34,047 --> 00:39:36,182
You make it happen in L.A.,
in vegas, in new York,

00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:37,317
we're there.

00:39:37,384 --> 00:39:39,185
And that artist comes out
of your percentage?

00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:40,854
Yes. Yes.
Comes out of
our percentage.

00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,955
It's the same deal.

00:39:42,022 --> 00:39:43,990
You know what? It is not
the same deal, Kevin.

00:39:44,057 --> 00:39:46,159
It's not the same deal
'cause we're only getting 25%.

00:39:46,226 --> 00:39:47,327
Just remember this--

00:39:47,394 --> 00:39:50,263
retaining 55%
of a watermelon

00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:53,166
is a whole lot better
than 75% of a grape.

00:39:53,233 --> 00:39:55,135
Don't sell yourself Short.

00:39:55,201 --> 00:39:57,270
Who was it that when they walked
into one of your clubs,

00:39:57,337 --> 00:39:59,939
the price of the tables
went up 10x?

00:40:00,006 --> 00:40:01,141
No, I remember.
But you know what?

00:40:01,207 --> 00:40:02,309
You're not selling
to guys like cuban.

00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:03,376
Let's be honest.

00:40:04,945 --> 00:40:07,948
Guess what? I am not
gonna lose this deal,

00:40:08,014 --> 00:40:09,249
so here's what
I'm gonna do--

00:40:09,316 --> 00:40:13,954
I'm gonna offer you
the $150,000 for 30%.

00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,122
So it's a worse deal.
Why would he do that?

00:40:16,189 --> 00:40:18,358
He's not stupid. Look at
the business he's built.
(mark)
Because we bring more value.

00:40:18,425 --> 00:40:21,161
We bring more value. But I need
an answer from you now.

00:40:21,227 --> 00:40:23,063
Right now.
Right now. (laughs)

00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:26,066
$150,000, and I will bring
an a-list artist to it.

00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:28,034
Okay, look,
I'll keep it interesting.

00:40:28,101 --> 00:40:29,936
That's what I love about me.

00:40:30,003 --> 00:40:31,237
I just like
to keep it interesting.

00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:33,273
$150,000 for 20%.

00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,241
You just took our percentage
down to 20?

00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:37,944
If you don't wanna be
with me, that's okay.
(laughs)

00:40:38,011 --> 00:40:39,346
All right.
You know what? I'm in.

00:40:39,412 --> 00:40:43,016
$75,000 each of us, 20%.

00:40:43,083 --> 00:40:44,918
When you need to have
that right party

00:40:44,985 --> 00:40:48,288
at the right club
to get that deal signed...

00:40:48,355 --> 00:40:50,156
Yeah.
We're gonna be able
to walk in,

00:40:50,223 --> 00:40:52,292
daymond and I,
and help you close the Deal.

00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:54,127
That face recognition
you talked about

00:40:54,194 --> 00:40:56,296
is gonna help you
close the deal.
Al, that is such noise.

00:40:56,363 --> 00:40:58,098
You've proven
a business model.

00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:00,900
People that own clubs
aren't there to party.

00:41:00,967 --> 00:41:03,336
They're there to make money.
Exactly.

00:41:03,403 --> 00:41:05,138
That's what Kevin
and I are offering you.

00:41:05,205 --> 00:41:07,140
I'm not a big shot 
like cuban.

00:41:07,207 --> 00:41:08,942
I'm not arrogant like cuban.

00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:11,111
30%. 30%.
Time out. Time out.

00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,178
Why?

00:41:12,245 --> 00:41:14,014
Because--because
you can trust me.

00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,148
I'm not in the deal, okay?

00:41:15,215 --> 00:41:17,250
People who have
the most fun with their business

00:41:17,317 --> 00:41:18,952
make the most money.

00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:22,889
Ask yourself, who are you
gonna have the most fun with--

00:41:22,956 --> 00:41:24,291
These Boring guys...

00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:26,059
or Those two guys?

00:41:26,126 --> 00:41:27,894
Trust your gut.
Good point. Good point.

00:41:27,961 --> 00:41:30,363
You're gonna give up
10% equity for fun?
Trust your gut.

00:41:33,099 --> 00:41:35,268
Let me start off
with you guys' offer.

00:41:35,335 --> 00:41:39,139
Obviously, for the financial
part, their offer is better,

00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,307
um, for the Percentages.

00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:43,209
30%. 10% Difference.
That's a lot.

00:41:43,276 --> 00:41:44,911
You know,
especially as we grow,

00:41:44,978 --> 00:41:46,212
and we don't know
what the future holds.

00:41:46,279 --> 00:41:47,948
And as from this side,

00:41:48,014 --> 00:41:50,016
I love the tech,

00:41:50,083 --> 00:41:52,319
I love just
the--the merchant of truth.

00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:54,321
I respect it,
I understand it.

00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:59,993
But I think what this side
is missing is the branding guy.

00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,861
So for that...
wait a sec.

00:42:01,928 --> 00:42:02,929
I'm gonna have to go here.
Wait a sec.
Let me haul this...

00:42:02,996 --> 00:42:04,164
he said "Yes."
He said he went in.

00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,266
He said he went in!
(Barbara) It's a deal! (laughs)

00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:08,001
Thank you. Thank you.

00:42:08,068 --> 00:42:09,970
Thank you.
We are gonna party
and have a great time.

00:42:10,036 --> 00:42:11,071
Thanks, man.
Thanks, man.

00:42:11,137 --> 00:42:12,939
We did it!
(laughs)

00:42:13,006 --> 00:42:14,240
Mmm.
Good decision.

00:42:14,307 --> 00:42:17,277
(mark) All right, man.
Congratulations.
Not on my watch!

00:42:19,946 --> 00:42:23,249
Daymond, I-I expect that
from cuban, not from you.

00:42:23,316 --> 00:42:25,919
Thank you. I'll take that
as a compliment.

00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,255
When I went out there,
it was--it was a feeding frenzy.

00:42:29,322 --> 00:42:32,058
The sharks, uh, identified
with my--my idea,

00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:34,361
and I mean, I think
they saw the real value in it.
