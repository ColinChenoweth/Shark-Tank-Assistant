I'm seeking
a $3 million investment.
Whoa.

00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:20,354
<i>And fight each other</i>

00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,556
Are you gonna send money
to die here, Barbara?

00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:23,023
Would you mind
your own business? You're out.

00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,425
I'm trying to save
the money.
Mind your own business.

00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:26,927
I don't care
what happens to you.
I'm trying to focus here.

00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:28,695

I'm trying to listen here.

This is

00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:38,438
This is not a tiny market.

00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:39,640
Tell me why I'm wrong.
Well--

00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,041
All I know is
you're not selling anything.

00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:42,609
<i>It's sink or swim.</i>

00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:45,012
You've gotta get off your ass
and get out there and sell.

00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:47,648
It's not our money that's gonna
change it. It's your effort.

00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,049
Hello, sharks.
My name is Jim Pittman.

00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,619
I'm from
yorba Linda, california,

00:01:58,685 --> 00:01:59,052
and my product is airbedz,

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,055
the original
truck Bed air mattress.

00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,558
I'm here today seeking
$250,000

00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,194
for a 15% equity stake
in my company.

00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:09,129
Airbedz is
a custom-Designed air mattress

00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:11,865
Specifically made to fit
in the bed of pickup trucks.

00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:12,032
Our greatest features
are the cutouts

00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:13,066
in the mattress sides,

00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,636
which allows the mattress
to go around

00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:17,037
and, more importantly,
over top of the wheel wells,

00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:19,940
creating a sleep area
that utilizes

00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:21,542
the entire back
of the truck.

00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:24,945
With our rugged, heavy-Duty
cloth construction,

00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:26,547
and our built-In pump

00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,348
with both inflate
and deflate options,

00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:30,450
airbedz now creates
a mattress that's--

00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,920
a good night's sleep is
just an inflate away.

00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,054
I believe in this product.

00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:35,722
I know this product will be
a big success.

00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,925
Why?

00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:43,030
The camping industry is
a $56-Billion-a-year industry.

00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:46,133
Is there that big a need
for people to sleep

00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,701
in their pickup trucks?

00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:49,036
There's, uh, there's a major
need. I mean, just try a--

00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:52,472
So, Jim, let's say 1 in 10 guys
with a pickup truck want

00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:55,442
an air mattress in the back.
How do I find them?

00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,510
Where do I sell
this air mattress?

00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:57,678
How do I get to my customer?

00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,880
What does it cost me
to get to that customer?

00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:02,115
The--currently, we're, uh,
we're already in all--

00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,351
Pretty much all
the major warehouse stores,

00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:06,320
on their dot-Coms.
We're, you know,

00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,589
go to any of your
automotive accessory stores.

00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,591
Go to
the sporting goods side.

00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:12,459
Now you--'cause you're going
hunting, fishing,

00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,061
to the river,
to the desert--
Does one size fit all,

00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,128
or do I have to have
a different mattress...
No.

00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,029
For every design of pickup?
No. We, uh--

00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,565
with some
of our engineered features,

00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:21,568
one size fits
your full-Size 8-Foot beds.

00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:24,204
One size fits
your full-Size 6-Foot beds.

00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:26,340
Jim, one important detail--

00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:27,841
How easy is it
to pump this thing up?

00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:29,443
Can I do it,
as a woman, all by myself?

00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,644
Absolutely.
Do you need a gang
of people?

00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,145
If I could show you?
Yeah.

00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,448
Simple as turning
on the button.
(whirring)

00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:35,716
Oh, you have a pump.
And battery-Operated.

00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:36,884
The pump not only--
The pump not only inflates

00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:37,885
your mattress...
(clicks, whirring continues)

00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:38,886
You turn the Dial
to deflate it.

00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,387
(Click, whirring stops)

00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:41,722
now where's
the power source for that?
The pump operates off

00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,190
a rechargeable
12-Volt battery.
There we go. Okay.

00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:44,024
It's included in your packet,
and you have your home charger,

00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:46,293
so you just plug and go.

00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,027
Oh, that's cool.
It plugs
into your cigarette lighter,

00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:50,797
so we always say, "bag to bed
"in 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 minutes,

00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:52,366
"depending upon the application
of your truck--

00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,101
Do you have an 8-Foot bed
or the 6-Foot bed?"

00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:55,202
what are your sales?

00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:57,371
Sales last year
were $210,000.

00:03:57,437 --> 00:04:00,374
This year we're already
at $220,000.

00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,142
What's your cost
of goods sold?

00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:04,878
To--to make one mattress,
$50 to $60,

00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:06,480
and we sell it
for $199 to $209.

00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:07,681
That's retail,
though, right?

00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:08,815
That's m.S.R.P.

00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:10,050
And so when you sell it
to the camping stores,

00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:11,051
what do you sell it--

00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:12,019
Anywhere from $125

00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,855
to, at some of
the bigger box stores, $145.

00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,391
And, again, how many did
you say you sold so far?

00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,393
This--This year,
about 1,700.

00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,794
And the year before?

00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,029
About 1,600.

00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,964
You've come here to borrow money
to expand your business

00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:25,399
and to build
inventory, right?

00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:28,302
Well, n--We already have
about $400,000 in inventory

00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,003
sitting in the warehouse
as we speak.

00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,205
So you don't need inventory.

00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,039
What do you need
my $250,000 for?

00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,341
Uh, we're gonna--

00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:36,310
The additional money would be
to bring in additional staffing.

00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:40,013
Jim, why do you have
so much inventory in stock?

00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,917
Well, it would seem that way,
but--But, y-You know,

00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:45,752
with the understanding that
I'm a one-Man band

00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,754
at the office.

00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:48,055
You know, I'm dealing
with the big box stores.

00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,023
I'm dealing
with the marketing,

00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,793
so it takes away
a ton of time...

00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,026
No, but--But why so--
So we have--

00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:54,027
Why so much inventory?

00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:55,028
Did you have to buy
that quantity

00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:57,264
to get the price point?
No.

00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:58,465
No, that's what I chose
to buy.

00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:01,168
I got a feeling this is
a small niche market.

00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:02,870
No, th--I mean, uh--

00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:04,004
Uh, per year--
Jim, what percentage of people

00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:06,006
need a mattress
in the back of their truck?

00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:09,109
Go to any desert, any beach,
any place where you, uh--

00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:10,043
there's--
Jim, can I try it?

00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,212
Absolutely. Please.

00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,380
Help me with this, Jim.

00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:14,381
Barbara, you want to get
in bed with me?

00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:15,682
No, thank you. No. (laughs)

00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:16,884
Is this sturdy?

00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,017
It's a truck.
Jump on it.

00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:19,353
(chuckles)
whoo!

00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:20,053
Oh. (chuckles) Gee.
Whoa.

00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,956
Yeah, while Robert's sleeping
on the job, as usual...

00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:23,957
(laughs)
Can I ask you
some questions, jimbo?

00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:25,025
(Jim) You bet.

00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:26,360
Um, how much money
do you have in this?

00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,629
I've got over $250,000
of my own money invested

00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:29,796
into the project.
Wow.

00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:31,198
Wow.
(Barbara) wow.

00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:32,633
Well, where'd that money
come from?
(speaks indistinctly)

00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,701
I'm a general contractor
and a real estate developer,

00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:37,604
so I buy small houses,
bulldozer 'em,

00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:38,839
and build big houses
on the lot.

00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:40,040
How many competitors
do you have?

00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:42,643
There's one person making
an air mattress

00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:43,644
for the back of the truck.

00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,979
It is not supported
by our patent,

00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:48,348
and it has--none of 'em are
with a built-in pump,

00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,650
so if you have
an air mattress--

00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:50,684
I've never seen one
with a built-In pump.

00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:51,685
I'll give you that.
Yeah, so--

00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:53,120
Could--
Look, you've got

00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:54,054
$400,000 in inventory...

00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:55,055
correct.
Right?

00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:57,457
Why are you not
selling more?

00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:58,892
I mean, you're--
if it's international...
well--

00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,295
and you're online, anybody
can place an order, right?

00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,029
They could.
Bingo, Mr. Cuban.

00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,898
It's because this is
a fractionally tiny market.

00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:06,200
That's exactly
what This is telling you.
Mm.

00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:07,868
He's got the best product
in the world,

00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:10,370
and yet he's Only doing $100,000
worth of profit a year on it.

00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:11,638
There should be
$2, $3, $4 million.

00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:12,806
S-So, jimbo...
it's--

00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:13,807
in a--
How do you solve
that problem?

00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,275
Easy. Uh, y--

00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:16,276
Uh, we're--We're--
Spend a ton of money
marketing.

00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:17,878
No, not at all. Not at all.

00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:18,879
(speaks indistinctly)
Okay, Jim.
Let me ask you again.

00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:20,214
Why--
Why are you only selling

00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,050
$200,000 of the world's best
back-of-the-Truck air mattress?

00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,352
And there's no comp--
What's the problem?

00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:26,687
<i>And </i>no competition.
Yeah, and there's no comp--

00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,022
Nobody makes it. Why? Why?

00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,023
Well, with your expertise...
No.

00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,626
Y-You're bringing
in a n--a new--a new--
I am not an air mattress guy,

00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:34,761
and, believe me, the rest
of these bozos aren't either.

00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:36,096
At the end of the day...
no, they're not, but you--

00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:38,632
This is about a tiny market.
You've gotta refute it.

00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,367
You've gotta tell me
why I'm wrong.

00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:41,768
Oh, you're absolutely wrong.
This is not a tiny market.
Well, tell me why.

00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:42,035
This--This is a market

00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:44,471
that--That's been around
for 20 years.

00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:45,038
It's gonna be around
for 20 more years.

00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:47,774
You're, like, you know,
where were we at 20 years ago?

00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:49,710
That's probably
my best compliment I could get.
See, I disagree with--

00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:50,043
With the undertaker here.
I know.

00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,379
You know,
he's the undertaker

00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:53,714
'cause he's where
businesses go to die.
(laughs)

00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,848
Boy, isn't that True?
This one's already dead.

00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:55,849
It doesn't have to visit me.
No, it--

00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:56,850
cause he's...
(laughs)

00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,185
It's just starting to grow.

00:06:58,252 --> 00:06:59,520
I-I don't disagree with you
that I see a market there,

00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,122
because, look, if you're
the only player,

00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:04,558
you don't have--It doesn't have
to be a huge market, right?

00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,060
You can dominate a niche.
But the problem, Jim,

00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:09,763
is that you haven't
been dominating.

00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,465
You know, you've got the--
Well--

00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:13,200
You've got what appears to be
a great product, you know,

00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:14,768
but something's missing.

00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:16,170
You're telling us
these numbers.

00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:17,037
You're telling us
there's a market there,

00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:19,339
even if the undertaker doesn't
fully understand it.

00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:21,308
(chuckles)
The undertaker speaks
the truth.

00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,143
That's the problem.
Tell me why I'm wrong, Jim.
But--No.

00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,511
You're speaking the truth
of what you know.

00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:25,812
You--There--
there's still additional--

00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,014
All I know is
you're not selling anything.

00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,316
Well, we're not selling
because we don't have

00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:30,050
a sales force that's
going out there to sell.

00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,619
That's the reason?
We--we have you,
the buyers, coming to us,

00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:33,053
saying,
"we like the product."

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,055
Jim, you keep on Digging B--
Deeper holes, right?

00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:36,056
Yeah.

00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:40,561
If I had my life savings,
everything,

00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,764
on the line in a business,
which I've had before,

00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,199
where if I don't sell,
I don't eat--

00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:48,435
And trust me, I lived off of
mustard and ketchup sandwiches,

00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:50,370
and that's no lie, okay?

00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:52,940
If that was me, if I saw
a truck in the driveway,

00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:54,942
I'd be knocking
on the door, selling,

00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,777
and I would be able to go
door-to-Door

00:07:56,844 --> 00:07:58,045
and sell
more than 1,700 units.

00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:00,047
Sales cures all.

00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:02,950
You've gotta get off your ass
and get out there and sell.

00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:04,751
It's not our money
that's gonna change it.

00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:05,919
It's your effort...
(Kevin) It's you.

00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,255
And for that reason,
I'm out.

00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,126
You know, you're
the number one mattress.

00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:14,928
<i>Everybody </i>agrees
the quality is the best,

00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,363
and yet you can't sell it,

00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,099
and I personally think
it's a tiny niche market,

00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:22,169
'cause you're not able
to convince me otherwise.

00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:25,038
I have zero interest in
investing with you, my friend.

00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,274
I'm out.

00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,146
Jim...

00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:35,048
you're not selling.
You're putting it on shelves,

00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:37,050
and you're not selling
directly to the consumer.

00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:39,853
Uh, it could be
a great product,

00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,355
but you haven't proved
that today.

00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:42,623
I'm out.

00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:47,294
(mouths words)

00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:50,063
You know, I-I chose to take
this market slow.

00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,366
I wanted to test out
my product.

00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:53,934
I wanted to get
into the niche markets.

00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:57,171
We just need to get it into--
to--to more of the masses.

00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:58,772
It sounds like you're still
at the testing stage...

00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,040
not at all. No.

00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:03,043
And I can't afford for you
to test with my money,

00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,111
so I'm out.

00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:13,287
Jim, four sharks are out.
You got one shot left--Barbara.

00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:17,524
I just love the product.

00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:20,861
There's a lot of guys
with trucks out there,

00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:22,763
but I have a couple
of detail questions

00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:23,931
that are
enormously important.

00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:25,199
One, do you have a patent

00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:26,033
on the mattress
or the blowup device?

00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:30,270
I have a--I have four patents
on the mattress.

00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:35,709
(sighs)

00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:38,812
What bothers me most about
your pitch today--

00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,181
And This is why
I'm sitting on the fence--

00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:46,253
You're not a salesman.
You can't sell.

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,022
What are you going to do
to convince me

00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,025
to put my money in?
This is your one shot.

00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,962
Everybody else is out.

00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:57,931
I want to hear how
you're gonna convince me.

00:09:57,998 --> 00:10:00,434
Well, we're gonna jump
right into--

00:10:00,501 --> 00:10:03,337
Both feet--
the 3,500 existing contacts

00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:05,105
we have
of--of all of the--

00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:07,174
Kinda--It would be like
the, uh, grassroots effect.

00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:09,276
So the list of 3,500 people

00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:11,512
who said they were
sort of interested--

00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:13,347
You're gonna suddenly now go
home and start calling them?

00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:15,549
Well, we're bringing people
in to do that.

00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:16,950
I'm doing it as well,

00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:18,752
but b--Running
the day-to-day business,

00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:21,121
it's kinda hard to go str--
Directly into, you know,

00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:23,056
more than 10 or--Or 15
SALES Calls per day,

00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,926
where if we're hitting
50 SALES Calls per day,

00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:27,761
now you're--
You're increasing--

00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:29,930
That's just such an--Uh, sorry,
but that's just such an excuse.

00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:32,933
Sales is the lifeblood
of your business.

00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,034
The only thing you should
be doing right now

00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:36,069
is selling this stuff.

00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,772
I mean, I-I'm out,
but I gotta tell ya,

00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:40,874
I hate when people say
stuff like that.

00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:44,545
Are you gonna send money
to die here, Barbara?

00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:45,679
What are you doing?

Would you mind
your own business?

00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:08,535
You're out.
I'm trying to save
the money.

00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:10,037
Mind your own business.
I don't care what happens
to you.

00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:11,638
I'm trying to focus here.
I'm worried about
your money.

00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:13,207
I'm trying to listen here.
The business is just
being born.

00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:14,541
We're--
We're--We've exceeded

00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:16,743
the entire last year's sales
already, as of today.

00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,780
We'll be at $400,000
by the end of the--by december.

00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:27,421
All right. I'm gonna make you
your full $250,000 offer...

00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,391
but you better not lose
my money.

00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,293
I'll guarantee it.

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,664
But I want to have 50%
of this business.

00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:42,569
Wait. Before you start
nodding your head "No,"

00:11:42,636 --> 00:11:44,071
picture this with me
for a minute.

00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:46,607
Picture your beautiful truck
on qvc,

00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:48,809
not only nationally,
but internationally.

00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:51,378
There's no reason this has
to stay in the U.S.

00:11:51,445 --> 00:11:52,946
I mean, the idea
that you're not selling--

00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:55,048
honestly, 'cause the product
is so good--

00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:58,719
10,000 of these a day is
mind-boggling to me,

00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:00,287
but you've gotta move out
of the way as a salesman.

00:12:00,354 --> 00:12:02,623
Let a professional sell it.
Put your big truck

00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:04,024
in with your mattress.
Barbara, who's selling
who here?

00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:05,692
I'm selling him...
(mark) Yeah.

00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,860
Because I can see
you're not a businessman.
Wait. Jim. Jim, let me--

00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:08,161
Let me recast her offer.
I--

00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,796
Yeah.
I get it.
I get it, all right, man?

00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:10,797
You really do get it?
I don't think
you fully get it.

00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:11,999
(Robert) Well, if--
she's saying,

00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,968
"I'm gonna come work
for you full-Time,"

00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:16,770
because you can't sell
but she can,

00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:20,607
<i>and </i>she's gonna pay you
$250,000 to do it.

00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:23,243
That's a no-Brainer.
Mm.

00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,579
But it's not.
It--the--the sales are

00:12:25,646 --> 00:12:27,247
where they're at,
uh, you know?

00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:28,248
But you don't have them.
It--It's--

00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:29,249
are you declining
her offer?

00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:30,617
I'll counter you
an offer back...

00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:31,818
that's fair.
If you'll accept that.

00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:32,986
What do you have?

00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:36,790
Um, my counteroffer That
would be back would be 25%.

00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:38,725
(daymond laughs)
That's what you get, Barb.

00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:39,960
I'm gonna give you...
you know, it's--

00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:42,696
a moment to rethink that.

00:12:44,298 --> 00:12:46,466
Yeah. No.
My--My decision's final.

00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:47,467
That's your final decision?

00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:49,536
It's 25%.

00:12:52,306 --> 00:12:54,942
Well, good luck. I'm out.

00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:57,211
Thank you.

00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:05,819
He's a fool. He's a fool.

I brought it to the market,

it's, uh,
it's a big picture,

going on for 20 years.

00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:54,074
How did you come up
with the idea?

00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:56,643
I came up with the idea
because, uh, I wanted to be able

00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:59,913
to create a superfast machine
that you could train on,

00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,615
so I thought, wow, it would
be really cool to be

00:18:01,682 --> 00:18:04,451
on a track and not have
to really worry about

00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:09,623
other bikes or cars
or, um, anything like that.

00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,225
Tell us the vision.
Let's say, like,

00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,560
sky clubs,
where people would come in,

00:18:13,627 --> 00:18:15,362
and they would,
you know, pay

00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:18,565
anywhere from $25
to maybe $100

00:18:18,632 --> 00:18:20,467
to train
on the sky track...

00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:21,969
No, but what--What--
or the sky machine.

00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:24,438
What do you have today? Do you
have anything working or--

00:18:24,505 --> 00:18:26,540
Oh, yeah. Uh--Uh,
as you saw in the video,

00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:29,610
I invested... (chuckles) Uh,
a considerable amount of time...

00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:30,611
How much?
And money.

00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:33,247
I have, uh, close
to half a million dollars.

00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:35,449

staying on the money theme

00:18:35,516 --> 00:18:38,018
for a second,
keeping you focused there.

00:18:38,085 --> 00:18:41,488

for $3 million cash from you.

00:18:41,555 --> 00:18:43,357
That means you're telling me
the whole business,

00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:45,559

$15 million.

00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:47,528

00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:10,150
How many acres of land
did it require?

00:19:10,217 --> 00:19:12,286
I mean, it could be,
uh, 100 feet long,

00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:14,655

a really nice, tight track.

00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:17,491
You'd be like a gerbil
on a wheel.
(laughs)

00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:19,660
Well, you might need 200 feet,
but it isn't the distance

00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:21,461

but I just don't think
it's going to happen,

00:19:36,944 --> 00:19:39,279

the deck and say I'm out.

00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:40,848
Okay, that's not a problem,

But you may want one

00:20:05,472 --> 00:20:08,542
Scotty, my sense of you--
and I-I want you to take this

00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:12,045
in a positive light--
is you're the inventor/idea guy.

00:20:12,112 --> 00:20:14,281
You're not an executional guy,

00:20:14,348 --> 00:20:16,116
in terms of doing any
of this stuff.

00:20:16,183 --> 00:20:19,219
I took rollerblades from nothing
and started that company.

00:20:19,286 --> 00:20:20,988
If you came to ride it,
you might say,

for my backyard."

00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:24,658

Yeah.
(Robert) Yeah. It--

Well, s--

there at all,

00:20:38,372 --> 00:20:39,540
(clicks tongue)

00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:42,943
Scotty, I-I love things
that make you go fast,

00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:49,416
but I don't see the large-Scale
consumer application for it.

00:20:49,483 --> 00:20:52,019
No, uh, we--That--That's not
our main focus in the backyard.

00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,954
It's certainly
the ski resorts.

00:20:54,021 --> 00:20:55,022
Scotty, it's
an admirable goal,

00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:57,457
but I can't fly with you
on this.

00:20:57,524 --> 00:20:58,959
I'm out.

00:20:59,026 --> 00:21:01,795
Okay, I'm the only guy left,
Scotty, and here's what I say.

00:21:01,862 --> 00:21:04,665
I wish every investment I made
made money, But they don't.

00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:05,866
Some fail.

00:21:07,534 --> 00:21:09,369
You should think about
your ideas the same way.

00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:11,872
This is a dog from hell.

00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:14,641
This is a very bad idea.

00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,109
It howls at the moon,
and you should take it out

00:21:16,176 --> 00:21:17,578
behind the barn
and shoot it.

00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:19,813
It's over with this one.
Get something else going.

00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,114
This sucks.
No, I'm just starting.

00:21:21,181 --> 00:21:23,283
I'm out.

00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,651
Go get 'em, Scott.
Go get 'em.

00:21:24,718 --> 00:21:25,652
Go get 'em.
Thank you, guys.

00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:26,653
Thank you.
We appreciate it.

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,055
Appreciate it.
Nice to see ya.

00:21:30,724 --> 00:21:32,326
Didn't want those guys anyhow.

00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:34,862
We're looking for an Angel,
not a shark.

00:21:34,928 --> 00:21:37,164
Personally, if this was
an amusement park...

00:21:37,231 --> 00:21:38,298
It'd be cool.
I would pay...

00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:40,467
You'd try it.
To ride it, to play it...

00:21:40,534 --> 00:21:41,568
it looks very cool.
Because I would say--

00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:43,470
You need a small--
Oh, my god.

00:21:43,537 --> 00:21:44,771
You need a smaller model.
This was made
for mark cuban.

00:21:44,838 --> 00:21:47,274
You gotta be 7 feet tall
to use this.

Hi. I'm Queenie Davis...

00:22:11,632 --> 00:22:12,766
and I'm Andrew Goodrum,

00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,435
and we are here today
asking for $100,000

00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:18,705
in exchange for 30% equity
in our company.

00:22:20,073 --> 00:22:21,675
Today we want
to introduce you

00:22:21,742 --> 00:22:23,944
to one
of our original products,

00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:27,181
the innovative,
the hot, New boot illusion.

00:22:27,247 --> 00:22:29,917
Now boot illusions are
the next step

00:22:29,983 --> 00:22:31,251
in ladies footwear.

00:22:31,318 --> 00:22:35,155
It's a product that allows you
to go from a boot to a shoe

00:22:35,222 --> 00:22:38,225
or a shoe to a boot...
just like that.

00:22:38,292 --> 00:22:39,426
Today, I'm wearing a pair

00:22:39,493 --> 00:22:42,162
of low-Cut, trendy,
a little funky boots,

00:22:42,229 --> 00:22:43,163
but now watch.

00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:46,967
The magic begins to happen
when we unzip it.

00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:49,770
I simply grip it
and slip it off my foot,

00:22:49,837 --> 00:22:51,471
and I'm back in my shoes.

00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:53,440
It's that simple.

00:22:53,507 --> 00:22:56,310
Now initially when you purchase
a boot illusion,

00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:58,345
you not only get
a wonderful boot,

00:22:58,412 --> 00:23:00,514
but you get
a fantastic shoe as well.

00:23:00,581 --> 00:23:02,449
One of the benefits
of this product

00:23:02,516 --> 00:23:06,119
is you can purchase
additional uppers

00:23:06,186 --> 00:23:08,222
without having to buy
another shoe.

00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:11,558
In fact, you can
interchange this upper

00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:15,162
with shoes that you own
and have in your closet already.

00:23:15,229 --> 00:23:16,797
The boot illusions comes
in a variety

00:23:16,864 --> 00:23:20,267
of styles, colors,
fabrics, and lengths.

00:23:20,334 --> 00:23:22,569
You can literally fill
your closet

00:23:22,636 --> 00:23:25,172
full of tons
of fantastic boots

00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:27,975
at a fraction of the cost
of traditional boots

00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:29,610
and less than a quarter
of the space.

00:23:29,676 --> 00:23:31,778
This product is a Winner.

00:23:31,845 --> 00:23:35,349
This is the original,
hot, New boot illusion.

00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:38,252
Anything else is
just bootleg.

00:23:38,318 --> 00:23:39,253
(laughs)

00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:40,254
Boot-a-licious!

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,555
(mark and Queenie Laugh)

00:23:41,622 --> 00:23:42,990
Can we look at it?

00:23:43,056 --> 00:23:44,224
Sure, and I want you
to know,

00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:47,194
these are, uh, boots that are
made at my kitchen table,

00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:49,396
so the sewing is not great,
and I don't claim to be

00:23:49,463 --> 00:23:51,198
a s--a seamstress,

00:23:51,265 --> 00:23:52,299
but I-I just--
So you haven't sold

00:23:52,366 --> 00:23:55,002
any boot illusions yet,
if this is prototypes, right?

00:23:55,068 --> 00:23:57,137
Not boot illusions, uh, no.
Our company, uh--

00:23:57,204 --> 00:23:58,238
in June,
we went to a trade show,

00:23:58,305 --> 00:24:01,341
and we did sell about
$130,000 worth

00:24:01,408 --> 00:24:02,976
of our other product.

00:24:03,043 --> 00:24:04,278
Which other product?
What's the other product?

00:24:04,344 --> 00:24:06,246
Uh--
um, our other products
are rain boots

00:24:06,313 --> 00:24:07,548
as well as, um...
why don't you pull 'em out?

00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:08,815
Interchangeable sandals.

00:24:08,882 --> 00:24:11,218
So, Queenie, you're just
selling equity

00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:13,187
in just
the boot illusions line?

00:24:13,253 --> 00:24:15,322
Absolutely not.
It's the company.

00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:16,857
So you make the whole thing...
Yes.

00:24:16,924 --> 00:24:17,925
Just a standard boot
and sandal?

00:24:17,991 --> 00:24:19,159
Yes.
And you're doing all this

00:24:19,226 --> 00:24:20,427
out of your house?

00:24:20,494 --> 00:24:23,997
Uh, no. Uh, a funny story.
Uh, we... (chuckles)

00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,200
We came up with these products
at the end of last year.

00:24:26,266 --> 00:24:27,801
I had a dream that I went
to turkey,

00:24:27,868 --> 00:24:31,104
so I literally jumped
on a plane, went to turkey,

00:24:31,171 --> 00:24:32,573
and found a manufacturer.

00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:34,308
These are--
How did you get to turkey?

00:24:34,374 --> 00:24:37,277
Well, I just heard "Turkey--
We're boarding" in my ear.

00:24:37,344 --> 00:24:38,278
I was try--We was trying
to figure out

00:24:38,345 --> 00:24:39,646
where we was gonna go.
Right.

00:24:39,713 --> 00:24:41,448
I don't want
to sound flighty,

00:24:41,515 --> 00:24:42,916
but, you know, I was really
concentrating on it.
You already sound flighty,

00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:44,251
so don't worry about it.
(laughs)

00:24:44,318 --> 00:24:45,252
Yeah, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, don't worry
about that.

00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:46,353
(laughs)
(Andrew) right.

00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,487
That ship has sailed.
So--But I did.

00:24:47,554 --> 00:24:49,923
I just literally booked
a flight and said,

00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,491
"Andrew, we gotta go
to turkey."

00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:53,560
He said, "no, <i>you </i>gotta go
to turkey."

00:24:53,627 --> 00:24:54,595
Right.
"I gotta work." (chuckles)

00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:55,863
So I did. I went to turkey.
Right.

00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:57,764
(chuckles)
I didn't know anyone there.

00:24:57,831 --> 00:25:00,267
Uh, amazing.
It was just by happenstance

00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:02,736
that they were having
a large shoe show.

00:25:02,803 --> 00:25:04,271
Are you two married?

00:25:04,338 --> 00:25:06,139
No, we're not.
No, we're--
We're very good friends.

00:25:06,206 --> 00:25:10,177
Can a woman walk
in those shoes inside a boot?

00:25:10,244 --> 00:25:12,179
It seems clunky.

00:25:12,246 --> 00:25:14,047
No, it's not clunky at all.
No, not the way it's designed.

00:25:14,114 --> 00:25:15,182
Uh--
It's well-Designed,
actually.

00:25:15,249 --> 00:25:16,316
Right.
But it's not gonna work...

00:25:16,383 --> 00:25:17,184
it leaves
the important part.
Yes.

00:25:17,251 --> 00:25:18,519
In the winter, is it,
Queenie?
It abs--

00:25:18,585 --> 00:25:19,853
I mean, if you go
in New York city in the slush

00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,321
with this, it's not gonna
protect the shoe.

00:25:21,388 --> 00:25:22,656
Yes, it is. It's rubber.
It--It works--It works best

00:25:22,723 --> 00:25:24,191
in the winter.

00:25:24,258 --> 00:25:25,192
How much money have
you invested,

00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:26,360
and is it all your money?

00:25:26,426 --> 00:25:28,896
So far, we invested about
$40,000 of our own money.

00:25:28,962 --> 00:25:30,497
And what's the split
in ownership

00:25:30,564 --> 00:25:31,765
between the two of you?

00:25:31,832 --> 00:25:32,900
50/50.

00:25:32,966 --> 00:25:35,002
When you guys disagree,
how do you decide?

00:25:35,068 --> 00:25:37,137
I mean, we haven't had
that problem.

00:25:37,204 --> 00:25:38,772
That's because you're not
sleeping together.
No, we've dis--

00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:40,974
(men laugh)
Yeah, well, we've disagreed
a lot.

00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:41,975
(laughs)
We disagree a lot.

00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:42,976
Right.
Yeah.

00:25:43,043 --> 00:25:44,011
What's the price range?

00:25:44,077 --> 00:25:45,579
About $25 is
the manufacturer cost.

00:25:45,646 --> 00:25:47,314
The tall ones--About $32.

00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:51,718
Now, listen, the average cost
of a tall, leather boot is $299.

00:25:51,785 --> 00:25:58,659
We're gonna retail these boots
anywhere from $129 to $179.

00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:01,862
What's the cost
on this one here?

00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:03,163
The r--
the one you have
on your foot--

00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,364
the cost of that
to make it...
This is $25, right?

00:26:04,431 --> 00:26:05,365
And what do you
sell it for?
Yes. Yes.

00:26:05,432 --> 00:26:06,366
(Andrew) right. $25.
$25.

00:26:06,433 --> 00:26:07,367
To make it?

00:26:07,434 --> 00:26:08,669
$25 to make it.

00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:10,103
And to sell it for?

00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,138
Uh, $79.99.

00:26:11,205 --> 00:26:12,139
To the store?

00:26:12,206 --> 00:26:14,141
No, to our end customer.

00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:15,576
Your end customer
being who?
Your--

00:26:15,642 --> 00:26:17,177
Yeah. Our, uh--
the--the--

00:26:17,244 --> 00:26:18,178
Our direct customers.

00:26:18,245 --> 00:26:19,780
So online customers?
Online. Yes.

00:26:19,847 --> 00:26:21,348
Oh, you're not selling
to retail outlets?
Oh, you don't--

00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:23,250
Well, you know, that's what
we've been doing

00:26:23,317 --> 00:26:24,685
at the trade shows.

00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:27,221
You know, stores, boutiques
come in and purchase it.

00:26:27,287 --> 00:26:29,056
But you don't have
a large retail presence?

00:26:29,122 --> 00:26:30,224
You don't have somebody--
No. No.

00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,992
No, right now we're trying
to get a voice

00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:33,427
for the, um, boot illusions.

00:26:33,493 --> 00:26:35,028
Barbara, what do you think
about these?

00:26:35,095 --> 00:26:36,597
I think it's ingenious,

00:26:36,663 --> 00:26:38,999
and you know why
it's a great product?

00:26:39,066 --> 00:26:40,501
Shoes are so expensive.

00:26:40,567 --> 00:26:43,904
I hate ruining a pair of shoes
and paying the Shoemaker again

00:26:43,971 --> 00:26:45,305
to re-Sole my shoes.

00:26:45,372 --> 00:26:47,574
It's terrible,
and if I could save the money

00:26:47,641 --> 00:26:49,476
by Just slipping something
really cool-Looking

00:26:49,543 --> 00:26:53,680
on top of my shoe...
I love this product.

00:26:53,747 --> 00:26:55,482
So, Queenie,
I don't understand anything

00:26:55,549 --> 00:26:58,252
about women's shoes
or fashions.

00:26:58,318 --> 00:27:00,220
I think
it's a pretty good idea,

00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:03,223
just nothing that
I'm gonna add any value to.

00:27:04,758 --> 00:27:06,493
I'm out.

00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,229
Guys, the bottom line is
I have no feel

00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:11,198
for the retailing
of women's fashion,

00:27:11,265 --> 00:27:12,599
so I can't help you
at all...
okay.

00:27:12,666 --> 00:27:14,168
Okay.
So for that reason,
I'm out.

00:27:14,234 --> 00:27:15,769
Okay.
Queenie, I love your shtick.

00:27:15,836 --> 00:27:17,271
I love it, you know? You've got
an answer for everything...

00:27:17,337 --> 00:27:18,739
(laughs)
Yes.

00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:20,774
But here's something
that grinds me back to reality.

00:27:20,841 --> 00:27:21,775
Yes.

00:27:21,842 --> 00:27:22,776
You know, I look
at numbers...

00:27:22,843 --> 00:27:23,844
Mm-hmm.
All right?

00:27:23,911 --> 00:27:26,180
You're doing $120,000
in sales.

00:27:26,246 --> 00:27:29,650
If you paid yourself
even a $40,000-a-year salary,

00:27:29,716 --> 00:27:32,152
you make no money. Zero.
You're not profitable yet.

00:27:32,219 --> 00:27:33,587
You're telling me
your business--

00:27:33,654 --> 00:27:37,191
'cause you're gonna sell me
30% for $100,000--

00:27:37,257 --> 00:27:40,394
Is worth close to $300,000--
More than $300,000.

00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,728
It's not...

00:27:41,795 --> 00:27:43,063
we understand it's not.
And--

00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,298
If you know
it's not worth that,

00:27:44,364 --> 00:27:46,767
why did you ask me
for that value?

00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:48,268
Why did you do that?

00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:49,570
Because--
How do I punish you
for that mistake?

00:27:49,636 --> 00:27:54,141
Listen, these shoes, to women,
are like boys and Candy.

00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:55,909
Once you see something
you like...
(chuckles)

00:27:55,976 --> 00:27:57,644
You--It--It gets
in your head.
(Robert laughs)

00:27:57,711 --> 00:27:58,979
You gotta have it,

00:27:59,046 --> 00:28:01,148
and you--You don't stop
until you get it.

00:28:01,215 --> 00:28:03,250
I have a voice in my head, too.
You know what it says?

00:28:03,317 --> 00:28:04,751
Mm-hmm.
I'm out.

00:28:04,818 --> 00:28:05,986
Oh.
That's good. Thank you.

00:28:06,053 --> 00:28:08,355
Thank you for listening.
I do appreciate it.

00:28:08,422 --> 00:28:10,224
So you went to turkey.
Mm-hmm.

00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:12,159
(chuckles)
Did you just walk
the streets?

00:28:12,226 --> 00:28:14,061
Did you know anybody there?
I'm--I'm--
(Andrew chuckles)

00:28:14,127 --> 00:28:15,596
Absolutely not.
I didn't know anyone. Um--

00:28:15,662 --> 00:28:17,431
And how did you get
to a manufacturer in turkey?
(Andrew) The--

00:28:17,497 --> 00:28:18,999
Uh, the--the--
because... (chuckles)

00:28:19,066 --> 00:28:20,868
the--
Because, uh,
there was a woman

00:28:20,934 --> 00:28:23,270
who a friend of mine knew

00:28:23,337 --> 00:28:25,439
who knew a doctor
who had--Knew someone

00:28:25,506 --> 00:28:27,975
who had a family member
who worked in the shoe industry.

00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:28,976
Wow.
(Andrew chuckles)

00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:30,143
of course.
I'm a dreamer,

00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,612
and I didn't think
of this product.

00:28:31,678 --> 00:28:33,514
I had a dream
of the boot illusions.

00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,649
Wait, Wait, wait, wait.
All of a sudden, in a dream,

00:28:35,716 --> 00:28:37,317
building boot illusions
came to you?

00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:39,253
Well, my cousin visited me,
and I was, like--
It, uh--

00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:40,587
I was looking
at her boots...
it sounds wild, but...

00:28:40,654 --> 00:28:41,688
and I was like...

00:28:41,755 --> 00:28:43,323
(chuckles)
"Wow, those are so nice."

00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,691
She--and then she laughed
and she said,

00:28:44,758 --> 00:28:47,261
"those aren't really boots.
These are boot illusions."

00:28:47,327 --> 00:28:48,896
And she unzipped it
and took it off.

00:28:48,962 --> 00:28:51,098
I said, "I gotta see it,"
so I looked at it--

00:28:51,164 --> 00:28:52,599
she had the product?

00:28:52,666 --> 00:28:54,001
In the dream.
This is all in a dream.

00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:55,302
Oh, this is a dream. Oh.
So the next morning...

00:28:55,369 --> 00:28:56,970
(laughing)
I went out

00:28:57,037 --> 00:28:58,172
and bought a machine.
You're telling
the movie backwards.

00:28:58,238 --> 00:28:59,640
Yeah. (chuckles)
Yeah.

00:28:59,706 --> 00:29:00,641
Really. Really.

00:29:00,707 --> 00:29:02,376
So I have an offer.

00:29:04,378 --> 00:29:09,583
I want to give you
the $100,000 for...

00:29:11,685 --> 00:29:13,086
75%...

00:29:15,055 --> 00:29:19,660
of just
the boot technology,

00:29:19,726 --> 00:29:21,895
because I want
to license it.

00:29:21,962 --> 00:29:25,265
Every dollar that comes in--
You will get 25 cents of it.

00:29:25,332 --> 00:29:27,901
You just open
your mailbox...
hmm.

00:29:27,968 --> 00:29:29,236
And see the money.

00:29:29,303 --> 00:29:30,771
So are you willing to step
aside on this business

00:29:30,838 --> 00:29:33,907
and just say, "sure, do with it
whatever you want, daymond"?

00:29:33,974 --> 00:29:36,176
absolutely not.
All right.
Then listen to my deal.

00:29:36,243 --> 00:29:38,245
So now you're gonna do a deal
with a real estate agent?
Let me listen.

00:29:38,312 --> 00:29:40,147
Let's--Let me hear.
Let's hear her deal.

00:29:40,214 --> 00:29:45,319
So I'm gonna give you
$100,000 for 55%...

00:29:45,385 --> 00:29:47,387
Mm-hmm.
Not because I'm greedy...

00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:48,555
Mm-hmm.
But because I know

00:29:48,622 --> 00:29:51,058
$100,000 ain't gonna
make it happen...

00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:52,359
right.
Right?

00:29:52,426 --> 00:29:53,894
And I'm also gonna take 55%

00:29:53,961 --> 00:29:56,597
because I-I'm honestly
more experienced than you

00:29:56,663 --> 00:29:58,365
at s--Building a business.
Absolutely.

00:29:58,432 --> 00:30:00,000
Sure. Sure.
Every one of the entrepreneurs
I invested in have--

00:30:00,067 --> 00:30:04,338
Are making a fortune, all right?
And I think my worth is--

00:30:04,404 --> 00:30:06,607
Should certainly the--be
the majority interest.

00:30:06,673 --> 00:30:10,744
And by the way,
she's gonna all of a sudden

00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:12,846
be in
the manufacturing business

00:30:12,913 --> 00:30:15,115
and learn that business,
too, with you.

00:30:15,182 --> 00:30:17,217
Queenie, when you call
Barbara and say,

00:30:17,284 --> 00:30:19,686
"I want to go to the Cobb show
Or nasby SHOW,"

00:30:19,753 --> 00:30:21,355
whatever the c--May--
Case may be,

00:30:21,421 --> 00:30:22,723
she won't have
the slightest idea

00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:24,224
what you're talking about.

00:30:24,291 --> 00:30:25,392
You know, that is so untrue.
(Kevin) Okay, wait a second.

00:30:25,459 --> 00:30:26,827
Queenie, listen.
This is not her business.

00:30:26,894 --> 00:30:28,595
Listen, I am
your sleep therapist,

00:30:28,662 --> 00:30:29,763
and it's now time to make
a decision.

00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,965
(sighs)

00:30:34,735 --> 00:30:36,770
before you start dreaming again,
you're still here

00:30:36,837 --> 00:30:38,605
in the real world.
What are you going to do?

00:30:38,672 --> 00:30:41,074
You know what I want you to do
before you make a decision?

00:30:41,141 --> 00:30:42,943
<i>Please, </i>Barbara.
Go out in the hall

00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,978
and call any entrepreneur I've
gone into business with...

00:30:45,045 --> 00:30:46,580
ohh.
Oh, god.

00:30:46,647 --> 00:30:47,681
And see what they say.

00:30:47,748 --> 00:30:49,550
Listen, and I believe
in you, so...

00:30:49,616 --> 00:30:51,985
N--
We accept. Yes.

00:30:52,052 --> 00:30:53,320
(Robert) WHOO!
(Kevin) Whoa.

00:30:53,387 --> 00:30:55,022
(mark)
There you go, Barbara.
Way to go, Barbara!

00:30:55,088 --> 00:30:56,323
And you know what?
You've got great judgment.
Yes. Yes. (chuckles)

00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,891
Well, daymond, she showed you.
(mark) Daymond, hey.

00:30:57,958 --> 00:30:59,259
She didn't show me crap.
No, she didn't.

00:30:59,326 --> 00:31:01,161
No, she didn't.
No way.

00:31:01,228 --> 00:31:02,996
You made a great decision.
I know I did. I know.
(chuckles) Thank you.

00:31:03,063 --> 00:31:04,731
Are you crazy?
(Robert) Andrew,
I'm looking at you...

00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:06,400
huh?
And I just want to know,

00:31:06,466 --> 00:31:09,169
do I sense a little doubt
in your eye?

00:31:09,236 --> 00:31:10,938
Uh... (sighs)
'cause you're 50/50 owners.

00:31:11,004 --> 00:31:12,673
A guy with 20 years' experience
in the business?

00:31:12,739 --> 00:31:13,774
"Let's go
with a real estate agent."

00:31:13,841 --> 00:31:15,175
I don't--I don't regret it,

00:31:15,242 --> 00:31:19,279
but I-I did favor
the godfather of urban fashion.

00:31:19,346 --> 00:31:21,248
So we--and we appreciate
every one of you,

00:31:21,315 --> 00:31:23,650
and, Barb, I just thank you.
Thank you for the offer.

00:31:23,717 --> 00:31:25,152
I love you back.
I love you. (chuckles)
okay.

00:31:25,219 --> 00:31:26,220
Sweet dreams.
Good luck, guys.

00:31:26,286 --> 00:31:27,221
Bye. All right. (chuckles)
(chuckles)

00:31:27,287 --> 00:31:30,224
75% of the company?
No. Mnh-Mnh.

00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:32,226
She should have went with me.
My structure's in place.

00:31:32,292 --> 00:31:33,861
Uh-huh.
I'm telling you now,

00:31:33,927 --> 00:31:35,596
that was a big mistake.
Daymond, she dreamt
about going to turkey.

00:31:35,662 --> 00:31:37,497
She dreamt the product up
in a dream.
Yeah.

00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:39,433
Now she can dream about
the $5 million of sales

00:31:39,499 --> 00:31:40,901
that could have been
done tomorrow.

00:31:40,968 --> 00:31:44,071
That $5 million just flew
out the window.

00:31:44,137 --> 00:31:47,140
My initial gut was, um,
really to go with daymond.

00:31:47,207 --> 00:31:49,776
But 75% was way too much,

00:31:49,843 --> 00:31:52,312
and so we're so happy
Barbara gave us a deal.

Uh, $250,000 in sales

00:34:06,058 --> 00:34:09,628
Uh, we've only started
our Web site 12 months ago,

increased sales by 100%.

$129,000,

00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:20,506
and that was out of
a brick-And-Mortar retail store.

00:34:20,573 --> 00:34:22,808
Um, we were just selling sort
of, like, regular bikes, though.

00:34:22,875 --> 00:34:25,210
And, Fleetwood,
are the sales today are online?

00:34:25,277 --> 00:34:26,412
100%.

00:34:26,478 --> 00:34:27,980
And let me add, too--
No advertising.

00:34:28,047 --> 00:34:31,584
We have not spent a dollar
on any type of advertising.

00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,419
And would the total cost
of the bike be

00:34:33,485 --> 00:34:35,988
once I customize?

00:34:36,055 --> 00:34:37,723
The sales prices right now
on our bikes

00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:42,494
are averaging $641
for a fully customized bike.

00:34:42,561 --> 00:34:43,896
That is not cheap.
(mark) That's a lot of bike.

00:34:43,963 --> 00:34:45,831
That's not great--That's
not--That's not expensive.

00:34:45,898 --> 00:34:49,401
It's a very high end,
high end price point for bikes.

00:34:49,468 --> 00:34:53,239
Kevin, have you ever seen
a-a cruiser bike like this?

00:34:53,305 --> 00:34:54,807
No, no.
I-I-I get it, but--

00:34:54,873 --> 00:34:56,875
But the idea is that this is
a fashion statement

00:34:56,942 --> 00:34:59,778
towards a higher end
demographic.
A designer bike.

00:34:59,845 --> 00:35:01,580
Yeah.
This is a style accessory.

00:35:01,647 --> 00:35:03,048
And I will just say this,
you guys.

00:35:03,115 --> 00:35:05,885
The customers
that have bought our bikes,

00:35:05,951 --> 00:35:08,220
they don't even question
the price.

00:35:08,287 --> 00:35:10,589
If we sell ten bikes a day,

00:35:10,656 --> 00:35:12,391
we'll be doing
$2.1 million in sales.

00:35:12,458 --> 00:35:13,959
That's a lot of bikes, though,
Fleetwood.

00:35:14,026 --> 00:35:15,928
It's not very many bikes
at all.
How many are you doing now?

00:35:15,995 --> 00:35:18,430
This is a $600 million market.

00:35:18,497 --> 00:35:20,332
Well, no, this is--No...

00:35:20,399 --> 00:35:22,301
How many--How many bikes have
you sold per day the past week?

00:35:22,368 --> 00:35:25,004
This year, we're gonna sell
350 bikes.

00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,338
One a day.

00:35:26,405 --> 00:35:27,539
Fleetwood, you didn't say

00:35:27,606 --> 00:35:29,708
how much it cost you
to make that bike.

00:35:29,775 --> 00:35:32,044
What does it cost you?
Including shipping, $245.

00:35:32,111 --> 00:35:34,980
All right, $250,000
in sales this year.

00:35:35,047 --> 00:35:36,649
How much you gonna make
off that?

00:35:36,715 --> 00:35:38,717
We're gonna make
about $50,000.

00:35:38,784 --> 00:35:40,753
After you've
paid yourself something?

00:35:40,819 --> 00:35:42,321
I haven't paid myself anything.
But like I said--

00:35:42,388 --> 00:35:45,558
So if we normalized your salary,
we would break even, right?

00:35:45,624 --> 00:35:46,959
(Robert) No.
Don't you think
you're worth $50,000?

00:35:47,026 --> 00:35:49,662
We're a little over--I'm worth
a whole lot more than that.

00:35:49,728 --> 00:35:51,130
(mark and daymond Laugh)
Yeah, but I'm trying
to figure out--

00:35:51,196 --> 00:35:53,399
This is why I've been
doing this. This is my baby,

00:35:53,465 --> 00:35:55,668
and I'm--I've put in blood,
sweat, and tears on this.

00:35:55,734 --> 00:35:57,202
All I gotta do
is get out there.

00:35:57,269 --> 00:36:00,539
Example--NBA, sports teams,

00:36:00,606 --> 00:36:01,907
schools, colleges,
organizations.
But somebody has to do that.

00:36:01,974 --> 00:36:03,742
Then you gotta build them
and you gotta get the orders.

00:36:03,809 --> 00:36:05,644
Let me
point another problem out.

00:36:05,711 --> 00:36:07,880
Maybe, uh, the dog can answer
this question.

00:36:07,947 --> 00:36:09,982
He doesn't look like he's gonna
be answering it. (chuckles)

00:36:10,049 --> 00:36:12,751
$500,000
for 33% of the business.

00:36:12,818 --> 00:36:14,320
That means
you're valuing this concept

00:36:14,386 --> 00:36:15,955
at a million and a half dollars.

00:36:16,021 --> 00:36:17,723
Yes.
You don't make any money yet.

00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:20,125
All right, why's it worth
a million and a half dollars?

00:36:20,192 --> 00:36:23,729
We have an incredible brand.
We have an incredible product.

00:36:23,796 --> 00:36:25,631
People are crazy
about our product.

00:36:25,698 --> 00:36:27,299
You guys,
I am not just saying that.

00:36:27,366 --> 00:36:30,369
I get testimonials from people
that receive our bikes

00:36:30,436 --> 00:36:33,305
that are literally so excited
they're almost crying.

00:36:33,372 --> 00:36:36,909
Our bikes in any bike Shop

00:36:36,976 --> 00:36:39,378
would blow away
anybody in this market.

00:36:39,445 --> 00:36:41,046
We're just trying to do it
a different way

00:36:41,113 --> 00:36:43,649
because it's
a made-to-Order bike.

00:36:43,716 --> 00:36:46,151
I've funded the whole business
with my own cash.

00:36:46,218 --> 00:36:47,987
I haven't--
and--And how much
has that been?

00:36:48,053 --> 00:36:49,889
$185,000.
$185,000?

00:36:49,955 --> 00:36:52,091
Out of my retirement account,
too.

00:36:52,157 --> 00:36:54,660
So sometimes
what's happening is, right now,

00:36:54,727 --> 00:36:56,962
we're actually stalling
our growth by--We're saying,

00:36:57,029 --> 00:37:00,199
hey, we're no longer
taking orders right now.

00:37:00,266 --> 00:37:02,835
And we will cut people off
for a little bit of time.

00:37:02,902 --> 00:37:03,869
And people wanna
buy the bikes,

00:37:03,936 --> 00:37:05,304
but we can't build them
fast enough.

00:37:05,371 --> 00:37:07,306
Yeah, that's a pretty sexy
sales approach, though,

00:37:07,373 --> 00:37:08,574
to say, "We're running behind."

00:37:08,641 --> 00:37:10,509
Customers love it.
They tend to stay with you.

00:37:10,576 --> 00:37:13,112
Yeah, it's True.
I have two words for you.

00:37:15,714 --> 00:37:17,550
Great design.
Thank you.

00:37:17,616 --> 00:37:19,218
Incredible. But...
I appreciate that
coming from you.

00:37:19,285 --> 00:37:20,786
Even though
It's a great design,

00:37:20,853 --> 00:37:23,122
it's just a space
I don't want to be in.

00:37:23,188 --> 00:37:24,990
I'm out.

00:37:26,692 --> 00:37:27,793
No problem.

00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:31,430
Let me give you a little
endorsement as to your price,

00:37:31,497 --> 00:37:33,532
because I am your sweet spot.

00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,901
I buy, on average,
four bikes a year.

00:37:35,968 --> 00:37:38,003
It sounds absurd.
Dang.

00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,972
And I buy them
without the speed.

00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:41,507
I just--These simple bikes.

00:37:41,574 --> 00:37:44,343
And I pay, every single year,

00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:46,579
$550 per bike

00:37:46,645 --> 00:37:48,280
to get a piece of crap
that doesn't last

00:37:48,347 --> 00:37:50,950
at a beach resort I live in,
'cause it rots.

00:37:51,016 --> 00:37:53,953
Exactly.
All right? They don't
look sexy. They don't look fun.

00:37:54,019 --> 00:37:55,988
This is like a cute little
corvette, but it's a bike.

00:37:56,055 --> 00:37:58,123
So how much
are you offering him, Barbara?

00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:00,259
I'm not. I'm just...

00:38:00,326 --> 00:38:03,095
I'm just telling you this
price point is a great deal...

00:38:03,162 --> 00:38:04,797
that was--That was worth...
for this kind of bike.

00:38:04,863 --> 00:38:06,232
That advice was worth
what you paid for it.

00:38:08,734 --> 00:38:12,838
This product is
a total, total Winner.

00:38:12,905 --> 00:38:14,573
I am 100% certain.

00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,843
I'm very much stuck on the value
you've put on your business.

00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:19,044
It's not profitable.

00:38:19,111 --> 00:38:21,413
Look, you've taken a commodity,
a bicycle,

00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,781
and made it
a fashion statement.

00:38:22,848 --> 00:38:23,983
Correct.

00:38:24,049 --> 00:38:25,885
That's cool.
I even like the dog.

00:38:25,951 --> 00:38:27,319
But I am not gonna give you
$500,000

00:38:27,386 --> 00:38:28,921
for a third of this company.

00:38:28,988 --> 00:38:30,623
You're just--I-I don't know
if the company's worth

00:38:30,689 --> 00:38:31,991
half a million dollars yet.

00:38:32,057 --> 00:38:35,227
I mean, it's--It's--
It's embryonic at this point.

00:38:35,294 --> 00:38:37,630
You've gotta sell a ton of bikes
to prove it out.

00:38:37,696 --> 00:38:40,733
20 bikes a day, we're doing
$4.3 million a year.

00:38:40,799 --> 00:38:42,001
This is a untapped market.

00:38:42,067 --> 00:38:43,636
There's people
that see our bikes

00:38:43,702 --> 00:38:47,039
that don't even know
this type of bike exists.

00:38:47,106 --> 00:38:49,642
You're not a bad salesman.
I gotta tell ya.

00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:51,877
Thank you.
I mean, I'm impressed.
But look, I'm out.

Fleetwood, I think
you're on to something.

00:39:10,796 --> 00:39:13,165
I-I buy into the concept.

00:39:13,232 --> 00:39:14,900

I think you gotta prove

'cause there are
other competitors.

00:39:22,608 --> 00:39:23,742
You gotta catch

00:39:23,809 --> 00:39:25,644
There's no other competitor
in what we do.

00:39:25,711 --> 00:39:28,914
There's cruiser bicycles
that all look the same

00:39:28,981 --> 00:39:30,549
that are
in your local bike shop...

00:39:30,616 --> 00:39:32,751
right.
That cost almost as much
as these.

00:39:32,818 --> 00:39:34,587
Fleetwood, I can't get there
on the $500,000.

00:39:34,653 --> 00:39:35,788
I'm out.

00:39:35,854 --> 00:39:38,591
All right.

00:39:38,657 --> 00:39:39,758
Where is your brand
on that bike?

00:39:39,825 --> 00:39:41,227
I'm not seeing it
as I look at it.

00:39:41,293 --> 00:39:43,128
These are all handmade,
hand-Painted

00:39:43,195 --> 00:39:44,730
limited edition badges.

00:39:44,797 --> 00:39:47,633
But that goes on the very front
as I'm seeing that.

00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,969
Correct, which is
how bikes do it. Okay?
Mm-hmm.

00:39:50,035 --> 00:39:53,305
We also do custom seat covers,
custom designs, branding.

00:39:53,372 --> 00:39:55,174
Anything, chains or, like--

00:39:55,241 --> 00:39:56,508
This is a show-Off bike.
It really is.

00:39:56,575 --> 00:39:58,177
I know you guys are saying
It's expensive,

00:39:58,244 --> 00:40:00,079
but think about it.
For $650, you are--

00:40:00,145 --> 00:40:02,248
Yeah, I'm not saying it.
No, those are these guys.

00:40:02,314 --> 00:40:03,415
I'm not thinking
it's expensive either.

00:40:03,482 --> 00:40:04,717
No. Thank you.
Appreciate that.

00:40:04,783 --> 00:40:05,784
Barbara, Barbara,
I agree with you in that

00:40:05,851 --> 00:40:07,319
for a show-Off,
this is it.

00:40:07,386 --> 00:40:09,388
There is nothing else
like that.

00:40:09,455 --> 00:40:13,559
For $650, you're getting
transportation, exercise,

00:40:13,626 --> 00:40:15,961
eco-Friendly,
and head-Turning.

00:40:16,028 --> 00:40:17,663
People can't--
Stop.

00:40:19,465 --> 00:40:21,734
You've sold me.

00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,303
I would really like
to make an offer on this deal.

00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:28,574
I could smell the money
flowing from trees.

00:40:28,641 --> 00:40:30,643
You wanna partner on this
with me?
Yeah, I do, actually.

00:40:30,709 --> 00:40:32,645
But I-I don't think 30%
is enough.

00:40:32,711 --> 00:40:34,647
I would agree.
That's the difference.

00:40:34,713 --> 00:40:38,350
Not even for
This incredible product here?
(mark) That's not the point.

00:40:38,417 --> 00:40:39,652
(laughs)
It's gonna take
a lot of money, honey.

00:40:39,718 --> 00:40:41,320
(Robert) Wow.

00:40:41,387 --> 00:40:42,922
Look, the point, it's--It's--
It's the amount of money,

00:40:42,988 --> 00:40:46,425
but it's also--Success requires
effort, as you know.

00:40:46,492 --> 00:40:50,996
For us to really contribute,
it has to be more than capital.

00:40:51,063 --> 00:40:52,631
And so I think
that's the difference.

00:40:52,698 --> 00:40:54,700
And so I would be willing--

00:40:54,767 --> 00:40:56,168
If Barbara wants
to split it with me--

00:40:56,235 --> 00:40:59,138
$500,000
for 45% of the company.

00:41:00,606 --> 00:41:04,643
You know, mark, you plucked
that 45% right out of my head.

00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:06,679
There you go.
So if Barbara's in agreement--

00:41:06,745 --> 00:41:09,081
So we've gotta be right.
Two people think this way.

00:41:09,148 --> 00:41:10,749
Barbara can definitely
hook us up in New York,

00:41:10,816 --> 00:41:12,418
which is critical and--

00:41:12,484 --> 00:41:14,720
Forget about New York.
I could hook you up everywhere.

00:41:14,787 --> 00:41:17,456
Yeah. So the offer is,

00:41:17,523 --> 00:41:22,127
Barbara and I jointly together,
$500,000 for 45% of the company.

00:41:22,194 --> 00:41:24,597
Okay, I got a--
I got a question for you.

00:41:24,663 --> 00:41:25,698
Sure.

00:41:25,764 --> 00:41:27,299
What about 40%?

00:41:27,366 --> 00:41:30,703
Because here's the deal...

00:41:30,769 --> 00:41:33,706
really, honestly, I feel like
we're about to just explode.

00:41:33,772 --> 00:41:35,874
We are about to take off.

00:41:35,941 --> 00:41:38,210
And I feel like I'm really
giving up a huge amount of money

00:41:38,277 --> 00:41:41,680
for basically
2 1/2 years of...

00:41:41,747 --> 00:41:43,549
I haven't made a penny.
I've put a lot into this.

00:41:43,616 --> 00:41:46,652
I've created the brand.
I-I know we've got...

00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:48,120
not 2 1/2 years.

00:41:48,187 --> 00:41:50,055
Yes, it is 2 1/2 years.
It's way more than that

00:41:50,122 --> 00:41:52,725
because you come as a talent
as well.
Right.

00:41:52,791 --> 00:41:53,726
Okay. Props. I agree.

00:41:53,792 --> 00:41:55,060
So your blood, sweat,
and tears.

00:41:55,127 --> 00:41:56,028
Okay, what if we split
the difference?

00:41:56,095 --> 00:41:57,663
42%?

00:41:57,730 --> 00:41:59,298
Barbara?

00:41:59,365 --> 00:42:03,869
42%'s okay with me.

00:42:03,936 --> 00:42:06,205
I'll do--You do 42%...

00:42:06,272 --> 00:42:07,873
we got a deal?
I think that we got a deal,

00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,309
and I think you guys got
an incredible deal.

00:42:10,376 --> 00:42:13,279
That's the only kind
of deals we do. (laughs)
And a fun deal as well.

00:42:13,345 --> 00:42:14,747
Cool.
Ah!

00:42:14,813 --> 00:42:16,916
And my first Order is gonna be
for a mavs version.
You got it.

00:42:16,982 --> 00:42:18,717
You gotta put me ahead
of the line. I'm ordering one.

00:42:18,784 --> 00:42:20,553
You got it. All right. Okay.
Thanks, man.

00:42:20,619 --> 00:42:21,754
Thanks, guys! Appreciate it.

00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,722
Giving up 42%,

00:42:23,789 --> 00:42:26,559
I feel like I gave away
a little bit too much,

00:42:26,625 --> 00:42:30,329
but I do think mark and Barbara
were the right choice for us.

00:42:30,396 --> 00:42:34,667
So overall, I'm really happy
and I am excited.
