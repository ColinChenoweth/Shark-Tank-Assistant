This ask is excluding

00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:23,624
(Kevin and mark) Oh.
I think it's foolish.

00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,225
(Kevin) Are you crazy?

00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:26,860
<i>If the sharks hear</i>
<i>a great idea,</i>

00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:29,029
<i>they're ready to invest,</i>
<i>using their own money...</i>

00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:31,064
I have to say,
I love your little package.

00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:34,701
You're 5% apart.
Are you out of your mind?

00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:36,570
<i>And fight each other</i>
<i>for a piece of the action.</i>

00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:38,138
I'm gonna stick
to the $200,000.

00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,007
That's a stupid--
That's a mistake.

00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:41,642
What a creep.

00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,810
<i>But first the entrepreneurs</i>

00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,146

00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:52,719
No, no. It's a Hobby.

And I'm Erika.

00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,059
We founded our company
wild squirrel nut butter

00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:11,064
This January as sophomores
at the university of oregon.

00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,065
Wild squirrel is seeking
a $50,000 investment

00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,369
in exchange for 10% equity
in our company.

00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:17,371
Keeley and I
<i>love</i>peanut butter.

00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:20,440
In fact,
we love peanut Butter So much

00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,042
that one rainy Friday afternoon
in our college apartment,

00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:24,378
as we were scraping the bottom

00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,380
of yet another jar
of generic peanut butter,

00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,882
we realized that we had
a brand-New food processor

00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:30,017
and a bag of peanuts.

00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,886
So it wasn't long
before we had created

00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:34,588
our first batch
of homemade peanut butter.

00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,023
Since Erika and I both really
enjoyed creating recipes,

00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,358
we started adding
New Ingredients

00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:39,026
from around our house.

00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:42,629
We soon had come up
with four exciting flavors

00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,631
and<i>way</i>more peanut butter
than we knew what to do with.

00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:47,868
So we started passing it out
to our friends around campus.

00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:49,870
Today we wanted you all to have
the same opportunity.

00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:50,433
Any one?
Yep.

00:02:50,433 --> 00:02:52,005
Thank you.

00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:53,006
You're welcome.

00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:54,208
Thank you, Erika.

00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:55,442
You're welcome.

00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,844
(Keeley) So we have
four flavors.

00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,846
We have sneaky cinnamon,
which is our cinnamon raisin,

00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,147
bright eyed &amp; bushy tailed,

00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:01,048
which is our chocolate espresso
peanut butter,

00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:04,551
curious cocoa-Nut, which is our
chocolate coconut peanut butter,

00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:07,588
and we have pretzel pizzaz,
our honey pretzel peanut butter.

00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:08,956
It's good.
(Barbara) Wow.

00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,524
It's very good.
The pretzel's great.

00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:12,059
That's awesome.
That cinnamon's great.

00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,460
The, uh, the pretzel
is fantastic.
(woman) Good.

00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:14,027
(daymond) Very good.
Try the cinnamon.

00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:16,864
To date, we have sold thousands
of jars of our peanut butter

00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,398
on our web site,
at farmers' markets,

00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,067
and at campus street fairs.

00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,034
In the next month,
we'll be on shelves

00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:24,271
at grocery stores
throughout oregon.

00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:25,873
And we're confident
that with the right funding,

00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,040
wild squirrel Peanut butter
can become a national brand.

00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:30,444
So you sold thousands...

00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:32,613
in what time period
and how many?

00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,615
We have been selling
since february,

00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,450
and we've sold 3,500 jars.

00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:37,050
How many dollars
have you sold?

00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:41,054
We have, uh, gross--$14,000
and profited $7,000.

00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:43,056
What's the peanut butter
sell for?

00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:46,393
We make them for $3 and sell
them to the stores for $4.

00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,095
And they retail for $5.99.

00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,864
So you only make $1 of profit
per--Per jar?

00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:52,032
Right now. Since we're just
beginning, we haven't found

00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,034
the perfect sourcing
for all of our products yet.

00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:56,003
Tell me about you guys first

00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,037
before we get too far
into the details.

00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:59,377
What year in school--You said
you're sophomores still or--

00:03:59,377 --> 00:04:00,040
We're about to be juniors.
You're about to be juniors.

00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:01,942
At the university
of oregon.

00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:03,277
What are you majoring in?

00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,212
I am an environmental studies
and spanish major.

00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:06,446
I'm journalism and art.

00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:07,848
So we kind of fell into this.

00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,449
We call it our honorary
business major. (laughs)

00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:11,451
What kind of help have you
gotten from the outside

00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:13,554
and do you 2 each own 50%,

00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,589
or who else is involved?

00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:16,056
Right now, we each own 50%.

00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:19,359
My parents have backed us
for $50,000.

00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:22,029
Why do you need our $50,000?
They're little
peanut butter monsters.

00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,497
We need $50,000

00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:24,698
because the $50,000
we're getting from her parents

00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:25,933
will only cover
the first run.

00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,035
Ladies, just a quick question
about your business model,

00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,037
because we're selling them
for $4 a unit.

00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,373
The cost to make them is $3.

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,042
The profit's only $1.
You have to reverse that.

00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,712
You have to make it for $1
and make $3.

00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,714
Well, the bigger the run
we do with the co-Packer,

00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,115
the less it costs
per jar.

00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:44,117
How big does it have to be
that I could make $3

00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:46,386
on every one that you sell
instead of $1?

00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,755
We can cut--I-I'm confident
we could cut our cost

00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:50,090
by $1 a jar.
By $1 to $2.

00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:53,026
No. I want you to cut
your cost by $3.

00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:56,129
We c--I'm--I'm sure
we could do it.

00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:57,497
I'm confident
we could do it.

00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:59,099
(Barbara) Meanwhile,
how are you balancing that?

00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,034
How do you remain a student,
an inventor, a businessperson,

00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:03,036
and do it all at once?

00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,972
We--

00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,173
Well, the great thing about
being in college

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,374
is we have so many resources.

00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:08,809
We have an incredible
entrepreneurship program

00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:09,472
that's helped us a lot.

00:05:09,472 --> 00:05:11,812
So far
college has helped us.

00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,947
What I'm concerned with is,
is who's gonna run it?

00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:15,616
I mean, there are--There are
very successful people--

00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,384
Bill gates, Steve jobs--

00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:19,720
Who quit university because they
started their business

00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,855
and said, "Hey, this is better.

00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:24,691
I'm learning more running this
business than I am at school."

00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,693
And we've said that
a million times.

00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,228
And I think we're going
to fall term classes,

00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:30,264
and we're gonna feel it out
and see what's happening.

00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,966
So, Keeley and Erika,
so great peanut butter.

00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,168
Thank you. (laughs)

00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:35,035
I love your energy.

00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:38,605
But, you know, being new
to this space,

00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,308
I can't learn this business
with you.

00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:44,178
I need my money to work for me
and not me working for my money.

00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:45,479
Okay.

00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:47,447
I'm out.

00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,884
Okay. Thank you.

00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,055
So, ladies,
let's get down to business.

00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:57,024
(laughs)

00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,193
Um, you've said that
you will

00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:01,695
sell me 10% of this company

00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:03,764
for $50,000.

00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,266
So you're valuing
the company today

00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,302
at half a million dollars.

00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,337
Do you see any problem
with that?

00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:11,805
Nope.

00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,040
Our value's in future sales,
not in present sales.

00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:16,543
But you want me to pay
for the future now.

00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,111
Right. That's what
you have to do. (laughs)

00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:23,217
(Robert) Look, it--
Here's the difference between

00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:25,419
going to school
and the real world.

00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,020
In the real world,
when you fail,

00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:29,022
you don't get a bad grade
from your professor

00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,024
and go to another class
the next day.

00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:33,527
You lose money.

00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:35,262
Somebody needs to
do this full-Time,

00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:37,264
otherwise it's a Hobby.

00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:39,466
So who is gonna do it
full-Time tomorrow

00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:41,068
if I give you my money?

00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,035

Outstanding.

00:15:05,306 --> 00:15:06,307
Wow.

00:15:06,374 --> 00:15:08,409
So tell us about
what's included.

00:15:08,476 --> 00:15:10,211
What do we get?

00:15:10,278 --> 00:15:12,313
Primarily publishing,
merchandising, and touring.

00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,915
Right.

00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:15,283
And there's also, of course
record sales, digital downloads.

00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,718
There's
tv/film placement.

00:15:16,784 --> 00:15:19,754
There's lots of things,
but this, uh, ask

00:15:19,821 --> 00:15:21,923
is excluding the publishing.

00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:24,158
Oh.
Oh.

00:15:24,225 --> 00:15:26,627
See, that was gonna be
my question--Is this a 360 deal?

00:15:26,694 --> 00:15:28,062
Well, most of 360 deals

00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:29,430
actually don't include
the publishing.

00:15:29,497 --> 00:15:31,265
It's usually
an--An added negotiation.

00:15:31,332 --> 00:15:32,834
(Robert) Tom, explain to me
how the deal works.

00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,969
I'm not as familiar
as these guys.

00:15:35,036 --> 00:15:36,237
(mark) Yeah, let me.
You--

00:15:36,304 --> 00:15:37,205
Robert, what basically--

00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:39,173
360 means
it covers everything.

00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,010
So your touring,
your music sales.

00:15:42,076 --> 00:15:45,079
So what he's saying, it includes
all their revenues

00:15:45,146 --> 00:15:46,748
except for publishing,

00:15:46,814 --> 00:15:48,649
which is the, um,

00:15:48,716 --> 00:15:51,085
any revenue received
because they've written songs.

00:15:51,152 --> 00:15:52,286
(Kevin) I mean, come on.

00:15:52,353 --> 00:15:53,788
Publishing's what this
is all about.

00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,223
If these guys are huge
20 years from now,

00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:56,657
I want the revenue stream.

00:15:56,724 --> 00:15:58,726
I want to wet my beak
in that, too.

00:15:58,793 --> 00:16:00,228
Unless you want to throw
some more money in the pot,

00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:01,796
and we can talk about that,
but... (chuckles)

00:16:01,863 --> 00:16:05,099
So, Bert, who would you be
most comparable to today?

00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,101
We always get comparisons 
to, like, the black keys,

00:16:07,168 --> 00:16:08,603
white stripes.

00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,704
Love white Stripes.

00:16:09,771 --> 00:16:11,406
What do you bring
to the table?

00:16:11,472 --> 00:16:13,174
I've worked in So many
different capacities

00:16:13,241 --> 00:16:15,309
over the 25 years--
Major label, consulting,

00:16:15,376 --> 00:16:17,078
promotion and marketing--

00:16:17,145 --> 00:16:19,681
Everybody from Lenny kravitz
to shania twain. Um...

00:16:19,747 --> 00:16:21,349
you managed Lenny kravitz?

00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,484
No, this is promotion
and marketing areas, yes.

00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,386
Is this
your first entire band

00:16:25,453 --> 00:16:26,988
that you're gonna spearhead

00:16:27,055 --> 00:16:29,323
from conception
all the way through?

00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,925
Yes.

00:16:30,992 --> 00:16:33,928
But we're investing as much
in you as we are the band.

00:16:33,995 --> 00:16:35,797
Yeah,
I would think so.

00:16:35,863 --> 00:16:37,265
(Kevin) the percentage of bands
that break out

00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:39,233
and make a lot of money
for their investors is,

00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,969
as you know,
very, very small.

00:16:43,271 --> 00:16:45,239
(mark)
Look, the music business

00:16:45,306 --> 00:16:47,575
is the worst business
on the planet.

00:16:47,642 --> 00:16:49,410
It scares
the hell outta me.

00:16:49,477 --> 00:16:52,380
So for that reason,
I'm out.

00:16:55,483 --> 00:16:57,185
(daymond) I did a deal
with universal Music

00:16:57,251 --> 00:16:59,153
about eight years ago,

00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,323
and by the time I was done
investing in that music,

00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:05,393
I was out of $6 million

00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,761
for one album.

00:17:06,828 --> 00:17:09,664
Good thing is, I ended up having
a song called "Fatty girl,"

00:17:09,731 --> 00:17:11,432
and I made $100 million
off the clothes,

00:17:11,499 --> 00:17:13,000
But if it wasn't for that,

00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:14,736
I would've been demolished.

00:17:14,802 --> 00:17:16,304
Well, the--the--
Well, as I was saying,
(daymond speaks indistinctly)

00:17:16,371 --> 00:17:18,239
the publishing is where
you make the money...

00:17:18,306 --> 00:17:19,640
one--One second.
The touring is where
you make the money.

00:17:19,707 --> 00:17:21,242
One second.
Okay, I'm sorry.

00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:23,111
I'm out.

00:17:25,146 --> 00:17:27,982
You know, I have to say, I love
your little package here.

00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:30,985
I like Bert.
He looks like a virgin.

00:17:31,052 --> 00:17:32,920
And the girls are gonna
go nuts for him.

00:17:32,987 --> 00:17:34,355
Then you got your--
(Kevin) Wow.
You got a groupie.

00:17:34,422 --> 00:17:36,824
Then you got your John Lennon
lookalike guy.

00:17:36,891 --> 00:17:38,793
And then you got a guy
who needs a bath.

00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,994
Now the three together--

00:17:40,061 --> 00:17:41,963
Slash. It's slash.
It's not--Yeah.

00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,631
(Kevin, daymond,
and Robert laughing)

00:17:43,698 --> 00:17:45,733
So I like it, you know.
It feels real to me.

00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,336
But, you know,
you don't feel to me,

00:17:48,403 --> 00:17:50,405
in my bones, like a guy
that could hustle,

00:17:50,471 --> 00:17:52,006
break through doors.

00:17:52,073 --> 00:17:54,008
I want to<i>feel you</i>coming
at me,

00:17:54,075 --> 00:17:56,077
and I don't get that.

00:17:56,144 --> 00:17:58,746
So even if I loved the band,
I wouldn't buy into you.

00:17:58,813 --> 00:18:00,014
I'm out.

00:18:00,081 --> 00:18:02,250
Fair enough.

00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:04,385
♪♪♪

00:18:04,452 --> 00:18:06,220
It's okay.

00:18:06,287 --> 00:18:07,588
Are you an aggressive guy?

00:18:07,655 --> 00:18:09,824
I'm a martial artist
in kyokushin karate,

00:18:09,891 --> 00:18:11,426
third Dan.
Whoa.

00:18:11,492 --> 00:18:13,061
(Robert) Black belt.

00:18:13,127 --> 00:18:14,796
This guy is serious. Why didn't
you bring that out earlier?

00:18:14,862 --> 00:18:16,397
That says a certain discipline.
Barbara, you're wrong
about this guy.

00:18:16,464 --> 00:18:17,999
No, I'm not.
Anybody who can get
a black belt like that...

00:18:18,066 --> 00:18:19,434
I hope I'm wrong.

00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,035
(Kevin) the band's good.
I like their music.

00:18:21,102 --> 00:18:22,403
I'll make you an offer
just for the hell of it,

00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,238
'cause that's the business
you're in.

00:18:24,305 --> 00:18:27,408
You're in the crapshoot-
Who-the-hell-Knows business.

00:18:27,475 --> 00:18:31,479
I'll give you 200k for 50%
of<i>everything,</i>

00:18:31,546 --> 00:18:34,315
'cause I could lose $200,000
in the next 6 months with you,

00:18:34,382 --> 00:18:36,417
no problem.

00:18:36,484 --> 00:18:37,752
That's the deal.

00:18:37,819 --> 00:18:40,488
I've always wanted to have
a rock band in my portfolio.

00:18:40,555 --> 00:18:42,123
I know
it's a stupid investment,

00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,491
but it's cool,

00:18:43,558 --> 00:18:45,460
and I am not gonna run
the band,

00:18:45,526 --> 00:18:47,061
I'm not gonna
get in your way,

00:18:47,128 --> 00:18:48,429
I'm not gonna tell you
what songs to write.

00:18:48,496 --> 00:18:51,833
I'm giving you $200,000.
I want 50%.

00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:55,503
Yeah. I-I mean, for $300,000
I'd go up to 40%.

00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:56,971
I'm not there.

00:18:57,038 --> 00:18:58,473
You'll do $300,000
for 40%?

00:18:58,539 --> 00:18:59,874
For 40%.

00:18:59,941 --> 00:19:02,410
That's your counter
to Kevin?

00:19:02,477 --> 00:19:03,711
This is a crapshoot.

00:19:03,778 --> 00:19:05,680

it's a vanity play.

Deep down, I want to be
a rock star.

00:19:12,286 --> 00:19:13,354
I'll throw some money in.

00:19:13,421 --> 00:19:14,956
You want to join me?
Go 50/50.

00:19:15,023 --> 00:19:16,624
I'll go 50/50.
You got a deal.

00:19:16,691 --> 00:19:19,994
Um, do I--could I talk
to the band for a bit?

00:19:20,061 --> 00:19:21,496
(mark) Sure.
Is that okay?

00:19:21,562 --> 00:19:23,297
Yeah. Feel free.
Is that okay?

00:19:23,364 --> 00:19:24,465
Why don't you go ahead and take
'em back in the hallway? Yeah.

00:19:24,532 --> 00:19:26,667
I appreciate it. Thank you.

00:19:26,734 --> 00:19:28,436
I'm gonna rename the band
greed. (laughs)

00:19:28,503 --> 00:19:30,171
(Robert)
I like the name greed.

00:19:30,238 --> 00:19:31,472
Greed of love.

00:19:33,241 --> 00:19:36,544
Um, what do you want to do?
It's up to you.

00:19:36,611 --> 00:19:39,047
Should we do--Should we do,
uh, $250,000?

00:19:39,113 --> 00:19:40,748
Yeah.
I think so.

00:19:40,815 --> 00:19:42,784
As long as we have control--
Let's try to get--

00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,218
Let's try and get $250,000--
And if not then--

00:19:44,285 --> 00:19:45,453
And d-don't worry about
the control.

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,422
They're not gonna touch that.
Okay.

00:19:47,488 --> 00:19:48,423
They're good. They're good.
They're good.

00:19:48,489 --> 00:19:50,324
Well, they're good...
they are good.

00:19:50,391 --> 00:19:51,859
But there's
a million good bands.
There's a lot of good bands.

00:19:54,128 --> 00:19:55,496
All right. So what do you
have to say?

00:19:55,563 --> 00:19:58,332
We were hoping we can get
$250,000 for the 50%.

00:19:58,399 --> 00:20:01,469
And we could shake hands today
and move forward.

00:20:01,536 --> 00:20:03,404
I have to check
with my partner here.

00:20:05,073 --> 00:20:06,407
Robert, you would be cool again
with your daughter.

00:20:06,474 --> 00:20:08,209
Here's your chance.

00:20:08,276 --> 00:20:11,212
My daughter loves me, mark,
even without $200,000.

00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:12,347
I'm gonna stick
to the $200,000.

00:20:12,413 --> 00:20:14,015
Oh, what a creep.

00:20:14,082 --> 00:20:16,217
And I feel the same way.

00:20:16,284 --> 00:20:18,286
We're stuck at that number.

00:20:18,353 --> 00:20:20,555
That's the deal--
$200,000, 50%,

00:20:20,621 --> 00:20:22,924
and I hope you hit.

00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,126
I'm very confident
with the band.

00:20:25,193 --> 00:20:26,327
And I've seen bands

00:20:26,394 --> 00:20:27,395
make millions
and millions of dollars

00:20:27,462 --> 00:20:28,896
that I've been involved with.

00:20:28,963 --> 00:20:31,432
We can't do it. I'm sorry.

00:20:31,499 --> 00:20:32,400
Why?

00:20:32,467 --> 00:20:34,936
I know what these guys
are capable of.

00:20:35,002 --> 00:20:37,238

00:21:23,184 --> 00:21:24,752
The name of our business
is mix bikini,

00:21:24,819 --> 00:21:26,954
and we are seeking $50,000

00:21:27,021 --> 00:21:30,324
in exchange for 5%
of our business.

00:21:30,391 --> 00:21:33,027
It's no secret
women love to stand out.

00:21:33,094 --> 00:21:35,196
But there is nothing worse
for a woman

00:21:35,263 --> 00:21:36,631
than being at the beach

00:21:36,698 --> 00:21:38,499
and seeing another girl
in the same bikini,

00:21:38,566 --> 00:21:40,835
and that's the reason
we created mix bikini.

00:21:40,902 --> 00:21:42,203
♪♪♪

00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:46,941
Mix bikini is the world's
first interchangeable swimsuit.

00:21:47,008 --> 00:21:49,510
All the parts of mix bikini
are sold separately,

00:21:49,577 --> 00:21:52,880
and all the parts--they
interchange with one another.

00:21:52,947 --> 00:21:54,949
The more bikini parts
a girl collects,

00:21:55,016 --> 00:21:57,852
the more bikini designs
she can create.

00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,754
So if you go here to mix bikini,

00:21:59,821 --> 00:22:01,122
you can see how we make one.

00:22:01,189 --> 00:22:03,624
You start out
by picking your top,

00:22:03,691 --> 00:22:07,328
you pick either a Halter top
or a triangle top.

00:22:07,395 --> 00:22:10,598
Then you pick different prints,
you pick different colors,

00:22:10,665 --> 00:22:12,633
then you pick the back.

00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:16,437
And then you can also pick
rings and strings.

00:22:16,504 --> 00:22:19,774
And the next day, the bikini is
shipped out right to your door.

00:22:19,841 --> 00:22:22,610
But now the best part is,
when a girl decides

00:22:22,677 --> 00:22:23,778
to "mix it up,"

00:22:23,845 --> 00:22:25,880
she doesn't need to buy
a whole new bikini.

00:22:25,947 --> 00:22:28,583
She just purchases
any New additional piece

00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:30,885
she wants to add
to her collection.

00:22:30,952 --> 00:22:32,420
So for instance here,

00:22:32,487 --> 00:22:35,523
she switches out her left top
and her back bottom.

00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,191
Giving her a whole new look.

00:22:37,258 --> 00:22:39,927
And there is nothing like
mix bikini on the market.

00:22:39,994 --> 00:22:41,295
So we ask you,

00:22:41,362 --> 00:22:45,700
which one of you sharks
wanna swim with mix bikini?

00:22:45,767 --> 00:22:47,602
How many have you sold?

00:22:47,668 --> 00:22:49,604
Um, we haven't sold that many.

00:22:49,671 --> 00:22:52,006
We--We're just launched,
a soft launch.

00:22:52,073 --> 00:22:53,508
So your sales are zero?

00:22:53,574 --> 00:22:57,512
Not zero, But, uh,
very minimal.

00:22:57,578 --> 00:22:59,280
By the way, you didn't say
what that sells for.

00:22:59,347 --> 00:23:00,848
Do you mind my asking
what it sells for?

00:23:00,915 --> 00:23:02,450
So every part retails
for $9.99.

00:23:02,517 --> 00:23:04,252
The entire bikini 
would cost ya,

00:23:04,318 --> 00:23:05,853
depending on
which one you made,

00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,757
between $40 and $50 to create,
which is very reasonable.

00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:12,160
And is your intention
to sell it online period?

00:23:12,226 --> 00:23:13,327
No, no.

00:23:13,394 --> 00:23:15,029
We'd like to open up a kiosk

00:23:15,096 --> 00:23:16,798
so that when girls
walk through a mall,

00:23:16,864 --> 00:23:19,500
they can really get to touch
and play and feel

00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:20,802
and design it--

00:23:20,868 --> 00:23:22,170
and what's the cost
of one kiosk?

00:23:22,236 --> 00:23:24,172
The cost of actually
building the kiosk

00:23:24,238 --> 00:23:27,575
would cost us about $25,000
to build the freestanding kiosk.

00:23:27,642 --> 00:23:30,578
Negotiating the rent, that's
a--that's a whole nother story.

00:23:30,645 --> 00:23:32,947
We didn't ask about
a bigger topic here.

00:23:33,014 --> 00:23:34,782
You're asking $50,000 for 5%.

00:23:34,849 --> 00:23:36,184
That means that you're saying

00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,286
the company
is valued at $1 million.

00:23:38,353 --> 00:23:41,456
Yes.

00:23:41,522 --> 00:23:43,424
It was 10%
we were asking.

00:23:43,491 --> 00:23:44,992
I'm sorry $50,000
for 10%?

00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:46,327
Correct.
So half a million dollars.

00:23:46,394 --> 00:23:50,164
No. You know, you asked
for $50,000 for 5%.

00:23:50,231 --> 00:23:51,833
You guys
talk to each other?

00:23:53,434 --> 00:23:54,802
(Robert)
Yeah, which one is it?

00:23:54,869 --> 00:23:56,671
It's 10%, $50,000.

00:23:56,738 --> 00:23:58,039
(daymond) Okay,
so half a million dollars

00:23:58,106 --> 00:23:59,874
you're saying your company
is worth at this moment,

00:23:59,941 --> 00:24:02,643
and you haven't made
not one sale.

00:24:04,979 --> 00:24:06,280
(Kevin) I'm just trying
to understand

00:24:06,347 --> 00:24:07,682
what the business model is.

00:24:07,749 --> 00:24:09,083
Don't you just want
to license this to people?

00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:11,686
Maybe I do want to license
it to somebody. I'm not sure.

00:24:11,753 --> 00:24:13,454
There are so many ways
we can go with this.

00:24:13,521 --> 00:24:14,655
Well, pick one.

00:24:14,722 --> 00:24:15,823
We don't know. We're here.

00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:19,494
We're--We're--We're open
to suggestions.

00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,795
(mark) When you come into
the shark tank,

00:24:20,862 --> 00:24:22,263
you have to have a business.

00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:25,199
We can offer capital,
we can offer guidance,

00:24:25,266 --> 00:24:28,870
but we can't set the path
for you, right?

00:24:28,936 --> 00:24:31,739
What you guys have
is a product and an idea

00:24:31,806 --> 00:24:33,741
and a hope.

00:24:33,808 --> 00:24:35,209
I'm out.

00:24:35,276 --> 00:24:38,913
(Kevin) Frank, Frank,
I wanna make a point to you

00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:42,583
that if you've seen other,
um, entrepreneurs here

00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,118
in the shark tank
walk out with money,

00:24:44,185 --> 00:24:46,854
the only guys that ever,
ever get any money

00:24:46,921 --> 00:24:49,090
are able to articulate
in 90 seconds,

00:24:49,157 --> 00:24:51,592
here's how<i>I</i>get rich.

00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:54,796
That's all I care about.

00:24:54,862 --> 00:24:56,831
This is how you get rich,
because this is gonna--

00:24:56,898 --> 00:24:58,433
Now you're doing it?
Yeah, now I'm doing it.

00:24:58,499 --> 00:25:00,101
You want me to do
your presentation for you?
Now I'm doing it.

00:25:00,168 --> 00:25:01,803
Every girl that has ever
worn, seen,

00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:05,506
touched this bikini
has loved it and wants it.

00:25:05,573 --> 00:25:07,408
This bikini is gonna be
the next hottest trend,

00:25:07,475 --> 00:25:10,111
and it's a $10-Billion-a-year
industry.

00:25:10,178 --> 00:25:13,614
1/10 of 1% will make you more
money than you already have.

00:25:13,681 --> 00:25:15,183
Frank, Frank, you talk
so much smack, right?

00:25:15,249 --> 00:25:17,051
When you walked in the door,

00:25:17,118 --> 00:25:19,053
it was, you know, "kiosk."

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,622
$50,000 is not
gonna build a kiosk.

00:25:21,689 --> 00:25:23,358
It's not gonna program
the software.

00:25:23,424 --> 00:25:25,360
It's not gonna get
all the pieces together.

00:25:25,426 --> 00:25:26,761
But we have money.

00:25:26,828 --> 00:25:28,363
Okay? We don't have
the expertise.

00:25:28,429 --> 00:25:29,964
(Robert) What do you mean,
you have money?

00:25:30,031 --> 00:25:31,866
You guys
are asking about money.

00:25:31,933 --> 00:25:33,134
We have some money.

00:25:33,201 --> 00:25:34,869
How much money do you have
to put into this?

00:25:34,936 --> 00:25:36,604
We have as much as $500,000.

00:25:36,671 --> 00:25:39,540
So then why are you here?
(Robert) Yeah.

00:25:39,607 --> 00:25:41,242
I'm here because,
like you said, daymond,

00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:42,910
we need your expertise.

00:25:42,977 --> 00:25:45,179

Barbara, your woman's touch.

00:25:51,019 --> 00:25:53,354
I mean, I read a book one time
that said you can either

00:25:53,421 --> 00:25:55,790
hang around with chickens
or you can soar with eagles.

00:25:55,857 --> 00:25:56,991
We don't want to be
your eagle.

00:25:57,058 --> 00:25:58,793
We want to help you
be eagles, right?

00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,261
And I'm telling you how
we're gonna do it.
And you're not there.

00:26:00,328 --> 00:26:01,863
This is
how we're gonna do that.

00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:04,032
We're gonna either license this
to a major brand,

00:26:04,098 --> 00:26:06,868
we're gonna license it
to more than one major brand,

00:26:06,934 --> 00:26:08,903
we're gonna partner up
with an existing brand,

00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,438
or we can build a brand.

00:26:10,505 --> 00:26:13,408
It is not that easy.
Trust me.

00:26:13,474 --> 00:26:15,877

all over it.

00:26:15,943 --> 00:26:17,445
I'm out.

00:26:20,782 --> 00:26:21,883

I've always said,
they're little soldiers.

00:26:23,017 --> 00:26:24,185
I like them to send them out
into battle,

00:26:24,252 --> 00:26:25,420
take prisoners, come home.

00:26:25,486 --> 00:26:26,621
Look, I don't care

00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,955
if I do it with bikinis
or dog food.

00:26:28,022 --> 00:26:29,757
I couldn't care less.
I just want more money.

00:26:29,824 --> 00:26:30,925

it may be,

00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:06,828
I can't imagine it

00:28:28,343 --> 00:28:29,711
we were homeless.

00:28:29,777 --> 00:28:32,280
This is the motel
that we actually stayed at.

00:28:32,347 --> 00:28:33,981
When we lost our home.

00:28:34,048 --> 00:28:37,485
Being here motivated me to go,
"I-I gotta get outta this."

00:28:37,552 --> 00:28:39,654
My wife and I
have risked everything

00:28:39,721 --> 00:28:42,457
to make this program
come to life.

00:28:42,523 --> 00:28:43,691
Right, left. Front, back.

00:28:43,758 --> 00:28:44,892
To the right.
Right.

00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:46,561
Left.
Front, back. Come on.
Left.

00:28:46,627 --> 00:28:49,263
I want to prove that I can make
a name for myself on my own.

00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,265
I've had a lot of hurdles
in life.

00:28:51,332 --> 00:28:52,700
To the right side.
Walk 1...

00:28:52,767 --> 00:28:54,969
I know that we have
a great idea,

00:28:55,036 --> 00:28:58,706
and I need the sharks to help me
bring this idea to the world.

00:28:58,773 --> 00:29:01,776
♪♪♪

00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:15,189
Hi, sharks. My name
is Billy Blanks jr.

00:29:15,256 --> 00:29:16,391
And I'm the creator of

00:29:16,457 --> 00:29:17,625
"Billy Blanks Jr.'s
dance with me."

00:29:17,692 --> 00:29:21,796
I'm here today asking
for $100,000 investment

00:29:21,863 --> 00:29:23,831
for a 20% stake in my company.

00:29:25,266 --> 00:29:27,635
You know, I grew up
in a fitness family.

00:29:27,702 --> 00:29:29,971
My father is Billy Blanks,
the creator of "Tae bo"

00:29:30,038 --> 00:29:32,407
And the biggest fitness selling
dvd in history.

00:29:33,408 --> 00:29:35,376
But growing up
in a fitness family,

00:29:35,443 --> 00:29:37,445
I always felt like it was
a little too serious, you know?

00:29:37,512 --> 00:29:38,846
Uh, the boot camp thing--

00:29:38,913 --> 00:29:40,214
I wasn't about
screaming in people's face.

00:29:40,281 --> 00:29:42,216
I-I danced my whole life
on Broadway,

00:29:42,283 --> 00:29:44,285
and I always felt, well,
dancing keeps me in shape.

00:29:44,352 --> 00:29:47,188
I have a great time dancing.
Why can't it be fun?

00:29:47,255 --> 00:29:48,856
"Billy Blanks Jr.'s
dance with me"

00:29:48,923 --> 00:29:50,258
is an all-Inclusive workout

00:29:50,324 --> 00:29:52,393
for people of all ages,
shapes, and sizes.

00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,028
It includes
all styles of dance,

00:29:54,095 --> 00:29:56,397
from hip-Hop to bollywood
to line dancing,

00:29:56,464 --> 00:29:59,333
to the tango,
to hula dancing, african.

00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,402
You name it, we do it.

00:30:01,469 --> 00:30:04,105
So I want to show you guys what
dance with me is all about,

00:30:04,172 --> 00:30:05,306
all right?

00:30:05,373 --> 00:30:06,474
I brought my wife and my, uh,

00:30:06,541 --> 00:30:08,276
codirector of this program,
Sharon Catherine Blanks,

00:30:08,343 --> 00:30:10,144
and I got some students here.

00:30:10,211 --> 00:30:12,280
Everyday people, okay?
<i>(up-Tempo music starts)</i>

00:30:12,347 --> 00:30:13,815
Now I want you guys to dance

00:30:13,881 --> 00:30:15,216
in your seats a little bit
if you can, all right?

00:30:15,283 --> 00:30:17,452
Just move with us.
Arms. Yeah.

00:30:17,518 --> 00:30:19,020
Like that, Barbara.
I like that.

00:30:19,087 --> 00:30:20,188
Come on, Mr. Wonderful.

00:30:20,254 --> 00:30:22,090
(laughs)
Just groove with us,
all right?

00:30:22,156 --> 00:30:23,424
So the first step,

00:30:23,491 --> 00:30:24,892
we're gonna start off
with a little bit of hip-Hop

00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:26,794
rowing like this.
Row it out. Come on. Unh!

00:30:26,861 --> 00:30:28,229
Now if you're at home,

00:30:28,296 --> 00:30:30,231
I want you to get up and dance
with us, too, all right?

00:30:30,298 --> 00:30:32,200
Come on. Row it. Yeah.
So this is the row.

00:30:32,266 --> 00:30:33,534
We're gonna go hip-Hop style.

00:30:33,601 --> 00:30:34,969
Now we're gonna move on
to the next one.

00:30:35,036 --> 00:30:36,904
We're gonna go shoulder,
shoulder, down, whassup?

00:30:36,971 --> 00:30:38,973
Shoulder, shoulder, down.
Whassup?

00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,375
(sharks laughing)
Come on, y'all.

00:30:40,441 --> 00:30:42,210
Come on.
Shoulder, shoulder, down.

00:30:42,276 --> 00:30:43,945
Come on, daymond.
Whassup?

00:30:44,012 --> 00:30:44,979
Now double time. Here we go.

00:30:45,046 --> 00:30:46,981
Shoulder, shoulder, down.
Whassup?

00:30:47,048 --> 00:30:48,950
Whassup?
Shoulder, shoulder, down.

00:30:49,017 --> 00:30:51,285
Come on. Yes. We're gonna move
on to a little bit of disco.

00:30:51,352 --> 00:30:53,721
I know Mr. Mark cuban
used to teach disco.
Yeah.

00:30:53,788 --> 00:30:54,956
Right? Come on. Come on.
Oh, lord.

00:30:55,023 --> 00:30:56,124
Come on. Down here.
Get out there.

00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,792
Cheer him on, y'all.
Right here.

00:30:57,859 --> 00:30:59,794
Whoo! Yes, yes.
Where do you want me?

00:30:59,861 --> 00:31:02,363
Go, mark. Go, mark.
Right here. Come on.
I gotta be able to see you.

00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:04,866
(Barbara) Go, mark.
Go, mark. Go, mark.

00:31:04,932 --> 00:31:06,701
Come on. Come on.

00:31:06,768 --> 00:31:07,769
Look at that, huh?

00:31:07,835 --> 00:31:09,203
(laughs)

00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:11,139
Yeah, give it up for him.
There you go, baby. (laughs)

00:31:11,205 --> 00:31:12,273
(music stops)

00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,341
Thank you, guys.

00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,709
(mark) Wow.
That's it? Aw.

00:31:14,776 --> 00:31:16,277
I think I lost 20 pounds.

00:31:16,344 --> 00:31:18,379
(Barbara laughs)
(Robert)
Well, that was fun.

00:31:18,446 --> 00:31:19,681
High energy. Whoo.

00:31:19,747 --> 00:31:21,549
Thank you very much.

00:31:21,616 --> 00:31:23,184
So you know
from the "tae bo" Experience

00:31:23,251 --> 00:31:25,286
that it's very expensive
to launch

00:31:25,353 --> 00:31:27,055
a product into the market.

00:31:27,121 --> 00:31:29,257
I'm assuming that's why you're
here for the $100,000, right?

00:31:29,323 --> 00:31:30,458
Actually, I'm here

00:31:30,525 --> 00:31:31,693
for my instructor
certification program.

00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:33,928
I have dvds--Two dvds
out right now.

00:31:33,995 --> 00:31:35,630
They're at all the walmarts,
targets,

00:31:35,697 --> 00:31:37,465
best buy,
and with lionsgate.

00:31:37,532 --> 00:31:40,301
I have just signed a contract
with them for four more dvds

00:31:40,368 --> 00:31:42,270
to come out
in the next two years.

00:31:42,337 --> 00:31:43,905
Okay, so let--Let's get
some clarification here.

00:31:43,971 --> 00:31:45,273
Those are
your consumer products.

00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,108
And now you're looking
to create

00:31:47,175 --> 00:31:49,177
an INSTRUCTOR certification
program?

00:31:49,243 --> 00:31:51,112
So these are two separate
businesses then, right?

00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:53,114
It's two separate businesses.
What it is is,

00:31:53,181 --> 00:31:55,283
uh, you know, I have--Peop--
The e-mails that I'm getting

00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,652
are people going, "I've been
working out to the dvds.

00:31:57,719 --> 00:31:59,554
Now how do I do
the live class?"

00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,255
what I'm trying to do
is train the teachers

00:32:01,322 --> 00:32:02,523
to teach the workout

00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,925
so somebody
can do it in New York,

00:32:03,991 --> 00:32:05,693
somebody can do it in l.A.

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,395
So tell us about
the business model there.

00:32:07,462 --> 00:32:09,364
What happens is,
the instructor will come.

00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:11,199
They pay 250 bucks.

00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:13,601
Uh, they take
the 2-Day course.

00:32:13,668 --> 00:32:15,770
And then from there, they're
certified for one year.

00:32:15,837 --> 00:32:18,306
But, Billy, how do you scale it?
How do you make it go wide?

00:32:18,373 --> 00:32:20,375
When we go to each city,

00:32:20,441 --> 00:32:22,010
we select ten master trainers,

00:32:22,076 --> 00:32:23,878
that when we leave, they
continue to host certifications.

00:32:23,945 --> 00:32:26,381
My goal is to have
a person in every city

00:32:26,447 --> 00:32:27,882
by This time next year.

00:32:27,949 --> 00:32:30,151
And what's the revenue
of the combined business?

00:32:30,218 --> 00:32:31,652
Uh, right now, I don't know.

00:32:31,719 --> 00:32:33,588
They just released--
The dvds just released.

00:32:33,654 --> 00:32:35,356
You're asking us to invest
in this--

00:32:35,423 --> 00:32:37,525
call it
the wholesale business, right?

00:32:37,592 --> 00:32:39,027
Mm-hmm.

00:32:39,093 --> 00:32:41,029
But you're not giving us
any part of the retail business.

00:32:41,095 --> 00:32:44,298
See, if I give you $100,000,
I want you to work your ass off,

00:32:44,365 --> 00:32:45,700
you know,
every minute of every day,

00:32:45,767 --> 00:32:48,036
so we both get a return
on our investment.

00:32:48,102 --> 00:32:50,705
(Robert) Billy, look, for me,
mark hit the nail on the head.

00:32:50,772 --> 00:32:51,939
I think the brand is you.

00:32:52,006 --> 00:32:53,341
You build one,
you build the other.

00:32:53,408 --> 00:32:55,343
They've gotta be combined.

00:32:57,745 --> 00:32:59,881
Can you combine it?

00:32:59,947 --> 00:33:01,616
Yeah, I would combine 'em.

00:33:01,683 --> 00:33:04,218
I would combine 'em, 'cause
to me, it's that important.

00:33:04,285 --> 00:33:06,254
If you guys believe in me,
I'm not sitting here

00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,723
trying to keep everything
in my pocket.

00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:11,359
Billy, can you tell me more
about "Tae bo" With your dad?

00:33:11,426 --> 00:33:13,227
I was not familiar
with that at all.

00:33:13,294 --> 00:33:15,463
Yeah, "Tae Bo," uh, was
something my dad created

00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:18,032
that was a karate-Kickboxing
workout.

00:33:18,099 --> 00:33:20,034
It's the highest selling
fitness dvd in history.

00:33:20,101 --> 00:33:21,903
Did he invest
in your business?

00:33:21,969 --> 00:33:23,304
If it's such a big brand,

00:33:23,371 --> 00:33:24,906
he should be the biggest
believer in the world.

00:33:24,972 --> 00:33:26,474
Very good question.

00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:28,109
Uh, you know...

00:33:28,176 --> 00:33:29,477
some family structures
are different.

00:33:29,544 --> 00:33:32,447
Family structures where
the parents make money

00:33:32,513 --> 00:33:35,850
and the parents share
that wealth with their family.

00:33:35,917 --> 00:33:37,485
Then there--
So he's a cheapskate?

00:33:37,552 --> 00:33:40,221
(laughs) That's--
Well, I would--
or he's making you earn it.

00:33:40,288 --> 00:33:41,389
He's making me earn it.

00:33:41,456 --> 00:33:43,124
(Barbara)
So without his backup,

00:33:43,191 --> 00:33:45,693
how have you made that work
by yourself?

00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,029
Uh, well, my wife, who was
dancing here with me today,

00:33:48,096 --> 00:33:49,897
uh, she's been
a support system.

00:33:49,964 --> 00:33:51,299
And also, you know, for me,

00:33:51,366 --> 00:33:53,301
you know, when we built
this workout,

00:33:53,368 --> 00:33:54,535
my wife and I were homeless.

00:33:54,602 --> 00:33:56,437
You were homeless?

00:33:56,504 --> 00:33:58,539
Yes.

00:33:58,606 --> 00:34:01,342
Did your dad know
you were homeless?

00:34:01,409 --> 00:34:03,011
Yes.
I mean, are you estranged
from your Dad?

00:34:03,077 --> 00:34:04,879
Uh--
not to ask you
a personal question.

00:34:04,946 --> 00:34:06,514
You're not that close to him
is what you're saying.

00:34:06,581 --> 00:34:07,849
Not that close,

00:34:07,915 --> 00:34:10,184
But now things have seemed
to change a little bit

00:34:10,251 --> 00:34:12,220
in a better direction.
(laughs)

00:34:12,286 --> 00:34:15,790
Do you have the rights
to use the name Billy Blank jr.

00:34:15,857 --> 00:34:17,291
In all manners?

00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:19,360
Your dad's not gonna
come out of the woodwork

00:34:19,427 --> 00:34:21,362
and say, "look, I'm Billy
Blanks. Forget the junior part."

00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:23,297
(laughs)
seriously.

00:34:23,364 --> 00:34:24,732
No, I know what you're saying.
It's--It's a legit
legal question, right?

00:34:24,799 --> 00:34:26,300
It--it hasn't been an issue.
He knows about this contract.

00:34:26,367 --> 00:34:28,036
We have the same agent.

00:34:28,102 --> 00:34:30,204
Uh, so it hasn't been
an issue thus far.

00:34:30,271 --> 00:34:32,840
Billy, let me, uh, tell you
how I feel.

00:34:32,907 --> 00:34:34,342
I think it's great you take

00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:35,309
total responsibility
for yourself,

00:34:35,376 --> 00:34:36,944
independent of your Dad.

00:34:37,011 --> 00:34:40,314
When you get there, it's gonna
feel So much better.

00:34:40,381 --> 00:34:42,050
Thank you, Barbara.
And I think you know that.

00:34:42,116 --> 00:34:44,986
As a business,
it's not clear to me.

00:34:45,053 --> 00:34:46,754
So I'm out.

00:34:46,821 --> 00:34:48,256
(mouths word)

00:34:48,322 --> 00:34:50,391
(Robert) Billy, look,

00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:52,226
I have such respect
for your story,

00:34:52,293 --> 00:34:54,295
trying to come out of
the shadow of your Dad.

(crying)

00:41:49,177 --> 00:41:50,278
And I-I will definitely
take that deal.

00:41:50,345 --> 00:41:51,946
Don't make me cry.

00:41:52,013 --> 00:41:53,114
I'm sorry, but I will definitely
take that deal because...

00:41:53,181 --> 00:41:54,549
Do not make me cry.

00:41:54,615 --> 00:41:55,750
Thank you, guys.
Thank you.

00:41:55,817 --> 00:41:56,951
Thank you so much.
God bless you.

00:41:57,018 --> 00:41:58,152
I will do the best
for you

00:41:58,219 --> 00:41:59,120
that I possibly can.

00:41:59,187 --> 00:42:00,321
I promise you that.
All right?

00:42:00,388 --> 00:42:01,556
(both) Thank you.

00:42:01,622 --> 00:42:03,191
I truly appreciate that.

00:42:03,257 --> 00:42:04,625
I'm gettin' my sweat
on you. Sorry.

00:42:04,692 --> 00:42:06,394
Don't worry about it.

00:42:06,461 --> 00:42:07,628
Bye, guys. Thank you.

00:42:07,695 --> 00:42:08,830
Tell them thank you.

00:42:08,896 --> 00:42:10,031
All right. Will do.

00:42:10,098 --> 00:42:11,232
Thank you.

00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,203
(cries)

00:42:15,269 --> 00:42:16,804
I'm kinda overwhelmed
right now because it's--

00:42:16,871 --> 00:42:18,406
I just feel like

00:42:18,473 --> 00:42:21,976
it's the road to what we've been
fighting for, my wife and I.

00:42:22,043 --> 00:42:23,644
I'm so proud of you.

00:42:23,711 --> 00:42:25,046
I'm so grateful,

00:42:25,113 --> 00:42:26,714
because I know
there are times in life

00:42:26,781 --> 00:42:28,116
where people don't get
second chances.

00:42:28,182 --> 00:42:29,484
So I'm grateful for that,

00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:32,186
and I just think it's gonna be
a great deal.
