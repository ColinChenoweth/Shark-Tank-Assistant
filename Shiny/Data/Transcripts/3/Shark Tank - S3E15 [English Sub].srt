You just met the devil.

Isn't a cougar typically older?

00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:22,923
'cause she looks Younger than
you are.

I'm from trophy club, texas,

and my business is inspired by

I'm 11 years Dusty's junior.

00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,573
And when I started dating Dusty,
it just clicked.

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,309
Getting the taste
of dating an older woman,

00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,078
I-I noticed
so many more attributes

00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:54,715
that she has opposed
to a Younger woman.

00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,885
She's respectable,
she's playful, sexy.

00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,754
(Dusty) some of the benefits
of being with a Younger man?

00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:02,656
He plays great with my kids.

00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:04,958

the ultimate entrepreneur.

00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:06,994
I have gone all in.

00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,830
I have invested three and a half
years of my life.

00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:11,999
I've invested every cent
that I've had.

00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,301

00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:14,494
the term "Cougar" has become
a pop culture phenomenon.

00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:15,796
What started as a cute phrase

00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:18,098
has become
a True social movement...

00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:20,267
(chuckles)
a recognizable brand
with the type of awareness

00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:23,270
that billions of dollars
of persuasive advertising

00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:25,005
and marketing could never buy.

00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:27,774
Well, I've taken
that cougar term

00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:30,277
and applied it to one of
the fastest-Growing industries

00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:31,979
in the food
and beverage market.

00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,480
Introducing...

00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,617
Cougar energy drink for women--

00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:39,086
the industry's first
gender-Specific

00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,320
functional beverage.

00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:43,023
Cougar's infused
with 13 Super fruits

00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,993
that gives the cougar stronger
hair, skin, and nails.

00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,060
(growls)

00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:48,595
(growls)
Hormonal balance support...

00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:49,963
(speaks indistinctly)

00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,766
And a list
of other antiaging benefits.

00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:56,937
Those elements are combined with
a female-Friendly energy blend

00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:59,339
that give the cougar
a long-Lasting energy boost

00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:02,109
throughout the day,
with age-Defined support.

00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,644
It's also a great mixer.

00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,345
Cougartini?

00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,050
With the launch of cougar

00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:12,719
comes an even more Valuable
lifestyle brand.

00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:14,855
I have secured
the cougar trademark,

00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,423
and it is my vision

00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,660
to introduce multiple
age-Defying product lines

00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,696
to capitalize
on This modern cougar movement

00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,998
that many women
now confidently support.

00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:27,201
Isn't a cougar typically older?

00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,969
'cause she looks Younger
than you are.

00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:30,704
Well, she's been drinking
the cougar, the--

00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,239
(sharks laugh)
Drinking shots
for a while now.

00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:34,608
How old are you?
How old are you?
I'm 35.

00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:36,243
(mark) 35. Great.
Wow. You look great.

00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,312
Thank you.
(Robert) Isn't that too young
to be a cougar?

00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,647
Well, actually, if you look
at the Webster dictionary--

00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:42,349
There's an official cougar term?

00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:43,517
It's a middle-Aged...

00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:45,118
middle-Aged.
Woman that seeks

00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:48,055
a companionship
with a-a Younger male.

00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,523
So what is the age bracket

00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,058
of--of--of the cougar
you're talking about?

00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,793
Give me the demo market.

00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,161
Uh, 30 to 55.

00:04:54,228 --> 00:04:55,729
So, Barbara,
you used to be a cougar.

00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,998
(Robert and mark laugh)

00:04:58,065 --> 00:05:01,768
Ryan, you said the word
"Launch."

00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:03,403
So the word "Launch," to us,

00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,373
would mean
that it's not out yet.

00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,875
Uh, yes, sir, it--It is out.

00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:09,443
Okay.
It's about and about.

00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,912
Um, we have, uh, distribution
in the Dallas-Fort worth area.

00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,413
Is it selling?

00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,649
Yes, sir, it is. We've done
about $60,000 worth of sales.

00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:17,417
In what period of time?

00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,852
Uh, in about three years.

00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,087
(Kevin) Oh.
Oh.

00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,422
(laughs)
(Barbara) Oh.

00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:25,592
I'm not here to waste your time.
I'm sorry. I'm out.

00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:29,530
Ryan, can--Can our cougar
try it?

00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:32,666
Absolutely.
She'll actually take you some.

00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,001
But I want you to really look
at the labels.

00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,003
The hot pink--It's
in a male-Dominated market,

00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,804
so you've got your yellows,
your blues,

00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:40,007
and--And--And, uh,
your reds.

00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:42,809
So it definitely stands out
to the consumer.

00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,244
Ryan, how many calories in this?

00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:45,712
Zero. Zero calories,
zero sugar.

00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:48,382
And what's that chalky taste
I have on my tongue now?

00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:49,850
Could be, uh,
maybe the niacin.

00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:51,952
Niacin is a, uh, detoxifier,

00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,054
so it's got kind of
a little chalky taste.

00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:56,290
You obviously sacrifice flavor
for effect.

00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,258
It tastes like chalk, honestly.

00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:00,327
Uh-huh.
I hate to say it's True.

00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:03,197
I'm out.

00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:05,899
Where are you selling them at,
Ryan?

00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:07,301
We're trying out
some 7-Elevens.

00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,869
We've got a smoothie king.

00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:12,105
Um, I recently found out that
a, uh, curves in pennsylvania

00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:14,274
picked it up from amazon,
So, uh...

00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:15,943
so you don't have
a distributor per se.

00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,911
You're making the calls
yourself.
I don't. Correct.

00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,913
Isn't the problem
with the strategy is

00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,849
you've trimmed your market
in two ways?

00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:25,285
You said you gotta be a woman
and you gotta be a cougar,

00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:28,121
which cuts the market
by really 75%.

00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:31,225
You've reduced your market size
down to 25% of the market.

00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,759
Why is that good?

00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:35,095
That's good because this was
a gap in the market,

00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:36,296
first of all.

00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:38,765
There--There are
no gender-Specific or, um,

00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:42,002
a female-Like beverage
that is nonrefrigerated.

00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,804
It can be tossed
into a woman's purse.

00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:47,674
The beverage market is
extremely competitive,

00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,142
because it turns out

00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,245
that the distributors
that control this space

00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:54,014
get paid very well by
the big brands.

00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,316
They get paid to crush
cockroaches like you.

00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,086
I'm out.

00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:05,292
Does the average woman
want to buy a cougar thing?

00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:08,195
Or is there any element
that the woman's gonna think,

00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:11,398
"I don't want to buy a cougar
drink. It makes me seem Old."

00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:13,667
Uh, you know, that's a--
that's a great comment.

00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:16,837
I'm obviously not a female,
so I can only use statistics

00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:18,338
to--to prove a point.

00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:21,942
Uh, you've got 7.5 million
viewers for "Cougar town."

00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:24,578
You've big names in Hollywood
representing it.

00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:27,414
You have, uh, a hundred
social dating web sites, so...

00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:28,949
Yeah, but, you know, Ryan,
come on.

00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:30,417
Look, here's what's going on.

00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:32,786
You pick a name and just
because you can find a name

00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:35,956
that has some
social attributes to it

00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:37,591
doesn't make it a business.

00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:39,960
You know, you've just come out
here and just said,

00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:42,162
"look, cougar's popular.
It's a popular term.

00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:43,597
"We all understand it.

00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:46,667
"So if we could slap 'cougar'
on a product,

00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:49,469
then that makes it work."
It doesn't work that way.

00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:53,273
I'm out.

00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,275
(Robert) you haven't sold me
on it.

00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:58,545
I don't think women are
gonna flock to this.

00:07:58,612 --> 00:07:59,880
I think it's a bit
of a gag gift.

00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:01,882
If you had 10 million women
that bought this product

00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,784
and you start to introduce,

00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:05,853
uh, your--Your canned
energy drink

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,654
and then cougar-Ade,
which is--
That's a big if, Ryan.

00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,392
You went from me buying
a gag gift to 10 million women.

00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:13,927
Look, the other big issue is

00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,196
a half a million dollar value
on your company.

00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:20,067
I mean, that's ludicrous.
So, Ryan--

00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:21,468
Well, the--the--obviously,
consumer brands

00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:23,770
are gonna--Is gonna need capital
to bring awareness to it.

00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,439
That's--That's a fact.

00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:27,007
You're--You're not--
but I'm standing here
to say, hey,

00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:29,576
those--Those clothing.
I designed those myself.

00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:31,178
I made 'em in house myself.

00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:32,513
Everything that you see.

00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:33,714
I'm out.

00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:38,085
Appreciate it. This, uh,

00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:40,420
this presentation, um,

00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:44,057
I hope, uh, impressed y'all,
and...

00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:45,425
apparently not.

00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,230
Thank you for your time.
(mark) Good luck.
Good luck, Ryan.

00:08:57,938 --> 00:09:00,340
It definitely hurts.
Uh, am I gonna quit? No.

00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:03,744
I'll go back home,
take a breather,

00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,846
and go sell my energy shots.
I'm not giving up.

00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:07,247
Cougar for life.

Hello, sharks.
Nice to meet you.

00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,675
Glad to be here.
My name is Gary Gagnon.

00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,077
I'm the founder and creator
of remyxx.

00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:40,914
I'm asking for $50,000
for 10% of my company.

00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:43,150
What I have for you here today

00:09:43,217 --> 00:09:44,818
is more than
just a great product.

00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:45,919
It's an innovation.

00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:48,922
It's a sneaker
with a purpose.

00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:52,826
As you can see,
I have cool, casual sneakers

00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:55,195
in strong colors,
with clever designs,

00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,264
for mass market appeal.

00:09:57,331 --> 00:09:59,199
But I'd have to be <i>crazy...</i>

00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,535
to think I'm gonna enter
the footwear industry...
(laughs)

00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:02,636
Yep.

00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:05,272
To go up against
these big sneaker giants.

00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:08,375
You see,
that's where I am crazy--

00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:09,643
Crazy with a kick

00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:13,280
that I know only remyxx
can deliver.

00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:17,317
What's special here is that
remyxx is wholly recyclable.

00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:19,753
That means all parts together

00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,356
can go back into
the recycling system,

00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:24,391
not the trash,

00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,627
for zero landfill impact.

00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:29,329
Sharks, I'm asking you to be
a pioneer.

00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:32,299
I'm asking you to join me

00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:34,134
on the ground floor

00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:35,569
to help make a change

00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:39,106
in the way we think about
sneakers and green living.

00:10:39,173 --> 00:10:41,808
Gary, you got any sales?

00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,177
My sales.

00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,812
My sales--I would say...
(chuckles)

00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,347
Are exactly where they would be

00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:50,017
for any company
as new as remyxx.

00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,151
So they're zero.

00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:52,319
My sales are zero.

00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:54,555
Mm. Okay.

00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:55,689
I can explain.

00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:56,757
Yeah, why don't you?

00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:57,824
This two years' worth of work

00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:00,928
is only now three weeks old.

00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,663
Gary, is your concept

00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:06,300
that you're gonna set up
retail stores?

00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:08,535
Is your concept
that you're gonna sell

00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:13,240
the component of how to do this
the existing shoe manufacturers?

00:11:13,307 --> 00:11:14,775
What's the game plan?
I mean, you're brand-New,

00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:17,010
you don't have any stores.
What's the plan?

00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:19,813
G-Game plan is wholesale,
uh, so it's gonna go into

00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,449
your--your big box stores,
that just like everybody else,

00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,218
they'll be right next
to the other big guys.

00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,620
I'm different. I'm special. They
don't have this. Like I said--

00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,622
May I see that?
May I see that?

00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,924
Oh, absolutely. Please.
(daymond) why don't you
send out a tray of sneakers

00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:32,359
so we can see the product?
Please.

00:11:32,426 --> 00:11:34,094
No, give me a pretty color,
like the green or the pink.

00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:35,996
Got that one just for you.

00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:39,333
Um, and I do have a size 10
that fits you, I believe, sir.

00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,667
Yeah, thank you.

00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:42,169
Oh, these are very cool.

00:11:42,236 --> 00:11:43,237
Here's some nice purple ones.

00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:44,738
Is the logo part
of your branding?

00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:47,140
Thank you, sir.
'cause I like--
I love the logo.

00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,009
I do, too. (laughs)
I can wear mine.

00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:51,278
Um, so the 5 is
actually a symbol

00:11:51,345 --> 00:11:52,880
of the type of materials used.

00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:54,548
It's--That's a--
that's a universal symbol.

00:11:54,615 --> 00:11:56,049
The recycle symbol is
common domain.

00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:57,451
Gary, am I allowed to--

00:11:57,518 --> 00:11:59,219
'cause This is gonna be
a bit of a problem--

00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:01,255
I know in my house,
my kids are religious

00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:04,324
about putting the right stuff
in the recycle bin.

00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,526
Right.

00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:07,427
If I put these shoes
in my recycle bin,

00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:10,464
will the garbage folks
pick them up?

00:12:10,531 --> 00:12:12,933
So technically,
these can go curbside.

00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,002
The processors
that receive it--

00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,471
they don't know
what a remyxx sneaker is yet.

00:12:17,538 --> 00:12:19,139
Right.

00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:20,307
So what I've offered here--
mail it back to me.

00:12:20,374 --> 00:12:22,242
I can guarantee
it gets recycled.

00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:24,044
I can guarantee it goes into
a new pair of sneakers.

00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:25,746
Okay. That's clever.
'cause my kids would like that.

00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:28,615
They'd like the idea of putting
them in, mailing them somewhere,

00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:30,450
knowing they're gonna get
recycled.
Right.

00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:32,052
How much have you invested
in this yourself?

00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:33,620
Um, $30,000.

00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:35,756
And do you have any other
partners or do you own 100%?

00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:37,291
That's it.
It's me and my family.

00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:39,092
I have two boys
that are 9 and 7--

00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:42,029
All over remyxx
with me every day.

00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,330
Why do you want to do this?

00:12:43,397 --> 00:12:45,032
Because you want to be
in fashion...

00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,134
I-I--
Or you want to do--
Have a green--

00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:48,936
You want to contribute?

00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:51,238
So first I need to sell
some sneakers.

00:12:51,305 --> 00:12:52,940
I can't help the world

00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:55,509
or the--the remyxx effort
that I call it

00:12:55,576 --> 00:12:58,178
until we--We get some fashion
out there.

00:12:58,245 --> 00:12:59,880
What are you gonna do
with the $50,000,

00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,248
and what's the next step?

00:13:01,315 --> 00:13:04,151
Where I'm leading to is for you
to get out of the gate,

00:13:04,218 --> 00:13:07,554
you're gonna need <i>way more</i>
than $50,000.

00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,389
I'm ready. Um...

00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,158
and you have
maybe 20 patterns there,

00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:12,693
I think, to my eye, right?

00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,828
Uh, yeah, I have 26.
Times six sizes each,

00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:16,930
it's 120 different sneakers.
(Robert) Wow.

00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:19,600
That's a lot of money--
Your point.
I'm just--
Yeah, let him answer.

00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:22,035
Um, that's the $50,000,
for the molds.

00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:23,337
So it's just--It's for the mold

00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:25,639
and inventory
to get the first order sold.

00:13:25,706 --> 00:13:27,074
And then when that goes--

00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,308
No, no, no, no.
Gary, come on.

00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,143
You're gonna need Well more--

00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,612
I mean, daymond can talk
to this--

00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:33,747
You're gonna need more than
$50,000 to build the molds

00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:35,516
and create the inventory.

00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:36,817
You're not even gonna--You're
not even gonna get the money

00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:38,819
until after you deliver it,
it's sold through,

00:13:38,886 --> 00:13:41,688
and then they give you the--
Basically your money back,

00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:43,824
so how can you get
the molds prior?

00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:45,926
The second I get an order,
great.

00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:48,128
200 pairs, 3,000 pairs,
whatever it is--

00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:51,665
I will make the sizes based
on that order I get.

00:13:51,732 --> 00:13:52,766
Right.

00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,501
So that $50,000
will go a long way.

00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:56,970
Gary, is there anything
about this process

00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:59,173
that would be proprietary

00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:01,909
and patentable that we could--
If was your partner...

00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,177
Mm-hmm.

00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:05,112
Take to one of
the giant shoe manufacturers

00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:06,747
that has a brand
that's known globally?

00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:08,749
'cause one of the things
that bothers me the most

00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:10,117
about this business is,

00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:12,819
any one of the giant four

00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:14,788
can do this in two seconds.

00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:20,127
I believe there is
several patents--

00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:22,596
Just how much you spend
on which one to protect--

00:14:22,663 --> 00:14:24,298
the construction of the shoe.

00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,500
These are not good answers.

00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:28,468
(Robert) It's a brand play.
You gotta create the market.
(mark) He gave you
an honest answer.

00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,170
There's nothing unique
that you can license

00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:31,805
to one
of the big shoe companies.

00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,006
That--That's the answer.

00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:36,076
You know, if you did
something bad on earth

00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:37,644
and went to hell,

00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,346
this is the business
you'd have to work in.

00:14:39,413 --> 00:14:42,850
Competing with the biggest guys
all around the world.

00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,551
Why did you--

00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:46,954
I'd have to be <i>crazy</i> to meet
with--Go against them.

00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,722
But you--Gary, why?
What's the reason?

00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:50,357
It's unique, it's different,
it's a distinction all its own,

00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:51,758
it hasn't been done.

00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:53,527
I'm first. Let's go.
I got a trademark name.

00:14:53,594 --> 00:14:55,963
You should go for it, Gary,
but you got a bigger problem.
(Kevin) Yeah.

00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:58,131
This business is
a cash suck, right?

00:14:58,198 --> 00:14:59,733
(makes sucking sound)
(Kevin) right.

00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,302
That's all the cash.
You didn't ask for enough.

00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:04,137
You know, you may be crazy,

00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:06,006
but you weren't crazy enough
to ask,

00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:09,309
because even when you build
your molds specific to order,

00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:11,979
right, then you gotta do
the inventory.

00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:13,514
And if you get a second order,

00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,849
you gotta get even more molds
and more inventory.

00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,818
No, I don't need the molds.
Once the molds are done,

00:15:17,885 --> 00:15:19,553
they're done.
Gary, you're missing the point.
You're missing the point.

00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,257
You're gonna need millions
of dollars to build inventory.

00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:25,125
These people don't pay on time.

00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:27,127
Daymond, what's the average time

00:15:27,194 --> 00:15:29,796
a large retailer is
gonna pay you for an order?

00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:31,198
It's--It's 90 days Max.

00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:33,267
It's gonna be 90 days,
But first of all,

00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,068
they're gonna test it,
number one,

00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:38,105
second of all, after one month
on the shelves,

00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:40,073
they reduce it by, I think,

00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,610
10% each week
that it stays on the shelf.

00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:45,712
So before you know it--
before you know it...
it really is hell, isn't it?

00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,915
You gotta there and start out
working in the stockroom.

00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:49,750
So, Gary, that's my problem.
If you're successful,

00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:51,818
you could go bankrupt.

00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:52,920
I'm out.

00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:55,756
Gary, where do you live
in the country?

00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:57,424
I live in north Carolina.

00:15:57,491 --> 00:15:59,526
Okay, it gets cold there
in february.

00:15:59,593 --> 00:16:01,061
You know what I'm thinking?

00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:03,297
Take these shoes, burn 'em.
Stay warm.

00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:04,865
You can't burn 'em.

00:16:04,932 --> 00:16:07,067
They'll get recycled before they
get burned, But thank you.

00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:10,170
Please, I implore you,
let me burn those.

00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:12,206
Please. I'm out.

00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:16,076
Gary, you're gonna get
that first order.

00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:17,477
You'll make the molds.

00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:19,213
Then you're gonna have to
invest in inventory,

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,248
and you know what? The minute
they see that inventory

00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:23,817
on a shelf somewhere, someone
else is gonna place an order,

00:16:23,884 --> 00:16:25,419
and then you're screwed.

00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,555
Because you haven't been able
to see far enough out

00:16:28,622 --> 00:16:30,891
and to plan for it
and to ask for enough money,

00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,593
that's why I'm out.

00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:38,932
Gary, I just don't buy in
to a unique sales pitch

00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:43,070
that recyclable sneakers are
a product people want.

00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:46,807
There's 300 million shoes
thrown away a year.

00:16:46,874 --> 00:16:48,709
Yes, and I don't think--
The sustainability market
is huge.

00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:51,845
Yes, and I don't think
this is unique enough. I'm out.

00:16:51,912 --> 00:16:54,515
Sorry to hear that.

00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:58,619
(Robert) So four people are out.

00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:01,455

00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:04,625
fubu, Mr. Billion dollar
Fashion guy left.

00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,894
Do your best sales pitch.

00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,762
You've been there, daymond.

00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:10,364
You've--You know
what it's like.

00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:14,001
The difference for me is
I'm--I'm just--just starting,

00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:16,637
just like--Same--Same train

00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,672
of action that you might've had.

00:17:18,739 --> 00:17:19,873
Do you own the name?

00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,542
Remyxx is trademarked, yes.

00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:25,012
You own the--and you do own
the Web site as well?

00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:27,414
I have remyxx my sneakers--

00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:29,049
Daymond, are these the shoes

can we go 50/50 for $100,000?

00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:31,178
Just so I don't have to
come back to you again

00:18:31,245 --> 00:18:32,880
for the next level
of inventory.

00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:36,216
You will not have to come back
to me for the inventory at all.

00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:39,920
I will either license it out,

00:18:39,987 --> 00:18:41,922
put it into my own products,

00:18:41,989 --> 00:18:43,657
or bankroll
whatever we're doing there,

00:18:43,724 --> 00:18:45,025
so you won't need
any more money.

00:18:47,261 --> 00:18:49,162
Awesome
and I love to hear that.

00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:51,064
The last appeal--I don't--
I don't want to--

00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:52,432
I'm not trying to haggle--

00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:54,568
I understand. You have to
understand what's going on.

00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:56,904
I have a family.

00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,406
(exhales deeply)

00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:04,978
So my two boys--
I look at this

00:19:05,045 --> 00:19:07,548
as I'm the first generation
of remyxx.

00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:10,217
I'd like there to be
a second generation of remyxx.

00:19:10,284 --> 00:19:12,519
That my boys are
very well aware of.

00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:15,055
So I still ask you for 50/50.

00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,729
The purpose of you asking
for 50/50

00:19:22,796 --> 00:19:26,366
is for a second generation
of remyxx. Correct?

00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:27,935
Well, what I'm gonna teach you
in this business

00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,269
you're gonna pass on
to your boys

00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:31,605
and you're gonna also have
the money--

00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:35,142
I'm telling you now--And I hate
to kill people's dreams,

00:19:35,209 --> 00:19:37,211
But the direction
you're heading,

00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:38,712
you're gonna spend everything

00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:41,048
that you ever even
held Aside for them.

00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:42,850
(sighs deeply)

00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,251
I'm a family man.

00:19:44,318 --> 00:19:45,452
I know.

00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,154
I'm buying more into you
than anything else.

00:19:47,221 --> 00:19:51,258
You will teach your boys
how to be what you are now

00:19:51,325 --> 00:19:52,993
and what I am now.

00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:57,698
Gary, what are you gonna do?
Make a decision.

00:19:57,764 --> 00:20:01,702
I-I obviously, I do trust you,
and that'd be a dream come True.

00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:04,805
Does it ever come back to you,
say "Gary, I need more percent"?

00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:06,039
no.

00:20:06,106 --> 00:20:07,741
No.

00:20:07,808 --> 00:20:09,376
(Robert) 50 grand for 80%.

00:20:09,443 --> 00:20:11,745

Hi. I'm Frank campitelli.

00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:57,477
Hi, I'm debrae barensfeld.

00:22:57,544 --> 00:22:59,847
We are personal trainers
from Medina, ohio.

00:22:59,913 --> 00:23:01,748
We are seeking $250,000

00:23:01,815 --> 00:23:04,117
for 10% equity
in nitroforce industries,

00:23:04,184 --> 00:23:06,787
which is home of the lightest,
strongest, safest,

00:23:06,854 --> 00:23:07,855
fastest, most versatile,

00:23:07,921 --> 00:23:10,958
most affordable home gym
on the planet--

00:23:11,024 --> 00:23:13,093
The nitroforce titan 1000.

00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,762
We've come up with
over a hundred exercises,

00:23:15,829 --> 00:23:17,998
but there's no limit to what
the imagination can make up,

00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:20,033
and right now, we just
want to show you a few.

00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,035
Frank is doing
a shoulder press,

00:23:22,102 --> 00:23:23,337
and he's gonna turn around

00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:25,339
and be in the perfect position
for a squat.

00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:27,274
We actually have
a leg press attachment

00:23:27,341 --> 00:23:28,842
which we have as an upsell.

00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:31,678
And now we're just gonna
remove the bench very quickly

00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:34,014
with just one pull pin.

00:23:36,483 --> 00:23:39,620
And...
This is our nitro shock.

00:23:39,686 --> 00:23:41,688
This weighs 2 pounds,

00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:44,691
offers 250 pounds of resistance.

00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:47,327
Our gas shocks have no weight.

00:23:47,394 --> 00:23:48,662
It's massless.

00:23:48,729 --> 00:23:51,231
That's where we get
our benefit.

00:23:51,298 --> 00:23:52,833
What I'm gonna do right now is

00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,369
put this
in a pulling position...

00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:58,105
(Click)
And we can do
a couple exercises.

00:23:58,172 --> 00:24:00,040
You would do barbell style
from the bottom.

00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:02,109
This is an upright row.

00:24:02,176 --> 00:24:03,644
And we're gonna do a shrug.

00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,847
My personal favorite is
the dead lift.

00:24:06,914 --> 00:24:10,651
We like to say, tighten
your Butt, tighten your gut,

00:24:10,717 --> 00:24:12,219
titan 1000.

00:24:12,286 --> 00:24:13,687
(Frank chuckles)

00:24:13,754 --> 00:24:15,322
right now, we're gonna change
the machine

00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:17,024
into a pull-Down mode

00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:20,861
and attach this--The, uh, uh,
c-Cable assembly really quick.

00:24:20,928 --> 00:24:23,463
Really quick. There we go.

00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:26,400
Are you gonna show Us
all 100 exercises?

00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:28,502
No.
No, this is our last one
that we're gonna show you.

00:24:28,569 --> 00:24:31,171
Um, with one arm,
you can grab it.

00:24:31,238 --> 00:24:33,207
And this is very exciting.
It's a bench punch.

00:24:33,273 --> 00:24:34,775
And we believe that the M.M.A.

00:24:34,842 --> 00:24:36,777
Would be extremely interested in
that. They can't do anything--

00:24:36,844 --> 00:24:38,745
That was a 30-Pound punch
and that was fast.

00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:41,548
Is this your prototype that
we're looking at, right here?

00:24:41,615 --> 00:24:43,016
This is actually
a manufactured piece.

00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:46,153
We have, uh, about 90 of them
in a warehouse right now.

00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,222
So you don't have any sales yet?

00:24:48,288 --> 00:24:50,090
Well, we didn't really try.

00:24:50,157 --> 00:24:53,560
We've sold 26 just to, uh,
clients. We're per--

00:24:53,627 --> 00:24:54,862
At what price?

00:24:54,928 --> 00:24:56,763
Uh, the price is $1,299.

00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,066
$1,300?
Yes.

00:24:59,132 --> 00:25:01,068
So what's your--
That was--That was
with free shipping.

00:25:01,134 --> 00:25:02,703
What's your cost to build?

00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:04,004
Our cost was $259.

00:25:04,071 --> 00:25:06,006
You valued your business
at 2 and a 1/2 million dollars.

00:25:06,073 --> 00:25:07,541
You have no sales.

00:25:07,608 --> 00:25:08,876
No. We--

00:25:08,942 --> 00:25:10,310
Well--Go ahead.

00:25:10,377 --> 00:25:12,312
We've had sales,
but we've done no marketing.

00:25:12,379 --> 00:25:13,714
We did all our testing.

00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,616
Uh, there were same things
that we had to change

00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:17,251
that I was--I felt that were--
You know,

00:25:17,317 --> 00:25:19,953
from the manufacturing,
weren't gonna make it, so--

00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,889
Where's the part where
it's worth $2 1/2 million?

00:25:21,955 --> 00:25:23,423
Um, the intellectual property.

00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:26,159
And, Frank,
you said you had sales?

00:25:26,226 --> 00:25:27,261
Well, yes.

00:25:27,327 --> 00:25:28,262
How many?

00:25:28,328 --> 00:25:29,796
20.
26.

00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:31,365
Because you're trainers, you're
selling the to your clients.

00:25:31,431 --> 00:25:33,834
Right.
How much have you invested
in total?

00:25:33,901 --> 00:25:36,036
Total--Uh, money-Wise,
about $200,000

00:25:36,103 --> 00:25:37,404
between the two of us.

00:25:37,471 --> 00:25:39,840
But this is
eight years going.

00:25:39,907 --> 00:25:41,341
What's your vision with this?

00:25:41,408 --> 00:25:43,243
Is this something you're gonna
sell direct to consumers?

00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,344
(both) Yes.

00:25:44,411 --> 00:25:47,447
So as--As you know, 98%

00:25:47,514 --> 00:25:50,017
of all equipment sold
into that market

00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:53,020
is never used more than once.

00:25:53,086 --> 00:25:56,089
Right.
That's because the equipment
usually isn't good enough

00:25:56,156 --> 00:25:57,624
for the user.

00:25:57,691 --> 00:25:59,393
No, be--It's because most people
are pretty lazy

00:25:59,459 --> 00:26:01,795
and don't want
to put the effort in.

00:26:01,862 --> 00:26:03,630
Actually, most of our--
You know, your industry was--

00:26:03,697 --> 00:26:04,965
your industry was born

00:26:05,032 --> 00:26:07,067
with Suzanne Somers
and the thigh master.

00:26:07,134 --> 00:26:09,102
And ever since then,
the model's never changed.

00:26:09,169 --> 00:26:11,004
It takes a tremendous amount
of capital

00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:12,739
to do a massive...
that's right.

00:26:12,806 --> 00:26:15,475
Launch, and, you know,
at the end of the day,

00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:17,811
you don't know until you've
spent half a million bucks

00:26:17,878 --> 00:26:20,447
if you're gonna make it or not.
I'm out.

00:26:20,514 --> 00:26:22,649
Who do you see
as your primary competition?

00:26:22,716 --> 00:26:25,152
Every device out there.

00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:26,787
One of the things
that this thing can do

00:26:26,854 --> 00:26:29,690
that those other products
that have done a billion dollars

00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:31,959
can't do is penetrate
the intermediate

00:26:32,025 --> 00:26:34,895
and professional expert who are
already working out.

00:26:34,962 --> 00:26:37,197
But, Frank, to sell
a lot of this equipment,

00:26:37,264 --> 00:26:39,633
it's not guys like you
or guys that work out,

00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,202
it's guys like O'Leary.
(Barbara laughs)

00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:44,738
You--You need guys
that never go to the gym.

00:26:44,805 --> 00:26:47,074
I really don't understand

00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,576
why This is different from
everything else out there.

00:26:49,643 --> 00:26:51,845
Resistance. Our gas shocks.

00:26:51,912 --> 00:26:53,814
Weights will cause damage.

00:26:53,881 --> 00:26:55,949
They also hurt your tendons
and your joints.

00:26:56,016 --> 00:26:57,417
On this,
you cannot hurt yourself.

00:26:57,484 --> 00:26:59,119
You don't get those injuries.

00:26:59,186 --> 00:27:00,420
See, that's a tough sale.

00:27:00,487 --> 00:27:03,290
It's gonna cost you $2 million
to educate people

00:27:03,357 --> 00:27:05,492
just to even
start thinking that.

00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:07,261
I'm out.

00:27:07,327 --> 00:27:09,930
You guys, the real issue is

00:27:09,997 --> 00:27:11,565
you can't come
into the shark tank

00:27:11,632 --> 00:27:14,735
looking for
a $2.5 million Valuation

00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:17,771
without having a proven sales
distribution model,

00:27:17,838 --> 00:27:19,673
and for that reason, I'm out.

00:27:23,377 --> 00:27:26,747
Every time my husband goes
on a business trip,

00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:29,550
I get three or four handymen

00:27:29,616 --> 00:27:31,919
to help me throw out
his latest acquisitions

00:27:31,985 --> 00:27:33,820
and sports equipment.

00:27:33,887 --> 00:27:36,290
So I couldn't think
of anyone less likely

00:27:36,356 --> 00:27:39,193
to buy in to your product.
I'm out.

00:27:43,463 --> 00:27:45,966
So I was thinking of my wife.
Would my wife buy this?

00:27:46,033 --> 00:27:49,203
I-I think she would find it
a little intimidating.

00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:50,504
It's too industrial.

00:27:50,571 --> 00:27:52,206
It's too expensive.

00:27:52,272 --> 00:27:53,841
It's too difficult.

00:27:53,907 --> 00:27:55,776
It takes up too much space.

00:27:55,843 --> 00:27:56,810
Why are--

00:27:56,877 --> 00:27:58,111
and that's too many toos.

00:27:58,178 --> 00:27:59,246
Too many toos.

00:27:59,313 --> 00:28:00,547
I'm out.

00:28:00,614 --> 00:28:02,115
Uh, and you're out.

00:28:02,182 --> 00:28:05,018
Can we just put
a little statistic out there?

00:28:05,085 --> 00:28:07,588
In the history
of direct-Response television,

00:28:07,654 --> 00:28:09,623
there's been 11 products
do a billion dollars.

00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,525
Four of them are home gyms.

00:28:11,592 --> 00:28:12,793
This will be the next one.

00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,461
I don't think this is the one.

00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:16,496
Frank, debrae, thanks.

00:28:16,563 --> 00:28:18,365
We wish you the best, guys.
(mouths word)

00:28:19,766 --> 00:28:21,335
Barbara,
look how big that is.

00:28:21,401 --> 00:28:23,403
Oh, my God.
That's bigger than
your entire apartment.

00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:25,372
I would kill bill
if he brought that home.

00:28:25,439 --> 00:28:27,074
If they want to keep their money
and be skeptics, that's fine.

00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,709
It doesn't deter me one bit.
Uh...

00:28:28,775 --> 00:28:31,078
we're just gonna keep going.
We're not gonna give up.

00:28:31,144 --> 00:28:32,913
We've got a nitroforce
in our living room,

00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,148
and we're gonna get a nitroforce
in Everybody's living room.

00:28:55,335 --> 00:28:57,638
Hello, sharks.
My name is Phil Dumas

00:28:57,704 --> 00:29:00,340
and my company is
unikey technologies.

00:29:00,407 --> 00:29:02,976
I'm looking
for a $500,000 investment

00:29:03,043 --> 00:29:06,113
for a 33% equity stake.

00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,815
My passion is access control.

00:29:08,882 --> 00:29:11,718
I know that sounds weird,
but it really is.

00:29:11,785 --> 00:29:14,388
Now the interesting thing
about this market to me is

00:29:14,454 --> 00:29:19,092
is that the key really has not
evolved in over 1,100 years.

00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:20,694
That's a long time.

00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:22,296
But my product, unikey,

00:29:22,362 --> 00:29:25,165
is the revolution of the key.

00:29:25,232 --> 00:29:28,168
I'm gonna incorporate your key
into your mobile phone.

00:29:28,235 --> 00:29:32,005
And now, you can take
this big old bulky keychain

00:29:32,072 --> 00:29:34,675
and get rid of it.
It's that simple.
(keys thud)

00:29:34,741 --> 00:29:36,710
Let me show you how it works.

00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:39,079
As long as I'm in range
of the lock,

00:29:39,146 --> 00:29:40,347
I can control it.
(whirs)

00:29:40,414 --> 00:29:41,715
Oh.
Now I simply walk out of range,

00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:43,317
and, mark,
if you could do me a favor

00:29:43,383 --> 00:29:45,953
and just hang on
to my phone/key for me.

00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:49,823
You can see just a regular user
has no control over the lock.

00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:52,793
They can only lock it. They
cannot unlock the lock again.

00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,796
So if somebody leaves,
they can lock the lock for you.

00:29:55,863 --> 00:29:57,064
Cool.
(Barbara) Mm.

00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,899
Now if I come back into range,

00:29:58,966 --> 00:30:00,868
you'll see
I gain access again.

00:30:00,934 --> 00:30:04,037
This is me. Walking up,
I gain access to my lock.

00:30:04,104 --> 00:30:05,806
It's that simple.

00:30:05,873 --> 00:30:07,941
Now another unique thing
about unikey is

00:30:08,008 --> 00:30:10,477
is by having the key
on your phone,

00:30:10,544 --> 00:30:13,647
we can send and receive keys
to and from other users

00:30:13,714 --> 00:30:17,451
on a onetime extended
and permanent use basis.

00:30:17,518 --> 00:30:19,353
So if you have a friend
come in to town

00:30:19,419 --> 00:30:22,022
and gets home before you,
you can send him a onetime key.

00:30:22,089 --> 00:30:24,491
If you have a maid service that
comes over every wednesday

00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:25,859
from 2:00 to 3:00 p.M.,

00:30:25,926 --> 00:30:28,362
their key can work
for just that period of time

00:30:28,428 --> 00:30:29,763
so you can rest assured

00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,798
they can't get into your home
at any other time.

00:30:31,865 --> 00:30:33,867
And then obviously,
you can send a permanent key

00:30:33,934 --> 00:30:36,069
to your spouse and your kids.

00:30:36,136 --> 00:30:39,640
But more importantly, at any
time, you can delete these keys.

00:30:39,706 --> 00:30:41,108
It's that simple.

00:30:41,175 --> 00:30:43,777
So with your help,
your capital, and experience,

00:30:43,844 --> 00:30:45,913
we can change
the access control market.

00:30:45,979 --> 00:30:48,148
Thank you very much for your
time. Are there any questions?

00:30:48,215 --> 00:30:49,716
(Robert) Phil, very cool.

00:30:49,783 --> 00:30:52,653
Is it a retrofit
to existing keys,

00:30:52,719 --> 00:30:54,421
or do I have to buy
a brand-New lock,

00:30:54,488 --> 00:30:56,190
brand-New handle,
brand-New everything?

00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:59,359
Great question.
Our technology is two bolts out,

00:30:59,426 --> 00:31:01,662
two bolts in with a new lock.

00:31:01,728 --> 00:31:03,497
On that lock, what is yours?
New lock.
You have to buy a new lock?

00:31:03,564 --> 00:31:06,500
Yes, we have the technology
that goes into the lock.

00:31:06,567 --> 00:31:08,702
I'm actually working With
black &amp; Decker right now.

00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:11,905
Can I use the regular original
key on that lock if I want?

00:31:11,972 --> 00:31:14,775
Yes. So if your phone dies
or you don't have it with you,

00:31:14,842 --> 00:31:16,443
we recommend you keep
a key laying around

00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,744
or one of your neighbors.

00:31:17,811 --> 00:31:19,346
You can just walk up
and use a standard key.

00:31:19,413 --> 00:31:20,581
Is this patented?

00:31:20,647 --> 00:31:22,816
We have an all-Inclusive
provisional patent filed,

00:31:22,883 --> 00:31:25,352
which part of the equity,
uh, money that I'm raising

00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:28,121
is gonna use to take that
into a nonprovisional status.

00:31:28,188 --> 00:31:31,658
Is your strategy to license this
technology to a manufacturer

00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:33,961
that distributes locks?

00:31:34,027 --> 00:31:35,863
Yes, so I'm working
with black &amp; Decker

00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:37,865
on a licensing structure
of my technology,

00:31:37,931 --> 00:31:39,900
their lock, their sales,
their marketing.

00:31:39,967 --> 00:31:42,069
So what's the next step
With black &amp; Decker?

00:31:42,135 --> 00:31:43,804
I'm gonna drop This off
tomorrow,

00:31:43,871 --> 00:31:45,072
and they're presenting it

00:31:45,138 --> 00:31:46,640
at their closed door
Executive Meeting next week.

00:31:46,707 --> 00:31:49,776
Phil, I have a basic question--
What do you sell it for?

00:31:49,843 --> 00:31:54,047
The goal is to get it to market
at $149 to $199.

00:31:54,114 --> 00:31:55,883
And that's ultimately up
to black &amp; Decker,

00:31:55,949 --> 00:31:57,351
how they decide to price it.

00:31:57,417 --> 00:31:59,086
What about someone who just
wants to use a key?

00:31:59,152 --> 00:32:00,854
What do they pay
for a similar lock?

00:32:00,921 --> 00:32:02,589
$30.

00:32:02,656 --> 00:32:04,291
So the difference is $100.

00:32:04,358 --> 00:32:06,560
Should I be worried
that it's such a huge premium

00:32:06,627 --> 00:32:09,162
to an ordinary lock
in this economy?

00:32:09,229 --> 00:32:11,899
Absolutely not. People are
buying technologies.

00:32:11,965 --> 00:32:15,068
So, Phil, I'm very interested.
I'm thinking This is fantastic.

00:32:15,135 --> 00:32:16,170
Thank you.

00:32:16,236 --> 00:32:17,804
Why not go to black &amp; Decker,

00:32:17,871 --> 00:32:20,073
raise the money from them

00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,743
for a 1-Year exclusive
in the market?

00:32:22,809 --> 00:32:24,111
They don't fund
the development.

00:32:24,178 --> 00:32:26,146
They're happy to pay
a royalty agreement.

00:32:26,213 --> 00:32:28,749
Now they're not my only pony.

00:32:28,815 --> 00:32:31,985
Anything with a key, anything
with a password, we can go to.

00:32:32,052 --> 00:32:33,820
We just need to further develop
the technology.

00:32:33,887 --> 00:32:37,424
And they're a customer that
really wants this technology.

00:32:37,491 --> 00:32:39,359
And if they don't--
I'll be honest with you--

00:32:39,426 --> 00:32:40,394
We can take this
to market ourselves

00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,229
and do very well
on the internet.

00:32:42,296 --> 00:32:43,363
In your dealings
with black &amp; Decker,

00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,199
what do you assume
the royalty to be?

00:32:45,265 --> 00:32:49,570
Uh, I want to go for about
7 1/2% of gross sales.

00:32:49,636 --> 00:32:52,406
You've asked for $500,000
for a third of the business,

00:32:52,472 --> 00:32:55,242
so you're telling me it's worth
one and a half million total.

00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:56,410
Post-Money, yes.

00:32:56,476 --> 00:32:58,245
How did you come up
with that value?

00:32:58,312 --> 00:33:00,848
Pre-Money, $1 million is
very reasonable

00:33:00,914 --> 00:33:03,250
for a tech company
with technology like this.

00:33:03,317 --> 00:33:05,452
I think mark
can attest to that.

00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,322
It's not outrageous.
Post-Money--$1.5 million.

00:33:08,388 --> 00:33:10,290
How much more money are
you gonna need

00:33:10,357 --> 00:33:12,659
to get the first one sold?

00:33:12,726 --> 00:33:15,562
I-I really need $1.1 million
to hit profitability.

00:33:15,629 --> 00:33:18,966
Now the $500,000 is
I'm calling round "a,"

00:33:19,032 --> 00:33:21,668
and there's
an extra $600,000 tranche--

00:33:21,735 --> 00:33:23,604
Okay, you've--You got
to this point--
Well, Phil, let's be clear.

00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,038
That doesn't get you
to profitability.

00:33:25,105 --> 00:33:26,940
That simply gets you
to end of proof of concept.

00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:28,775
No, the $500,000 does.
Right.

00:33:28,842 --> 00:33:31,879
The extra $600,000
gets us to profitability.

00:33:31,945 --> 00:33:33,380
So how are you gonna use
that $500,000?

00:33:33,447 --> 00:33:36,550
Okay. The first $500,000 is
patent protection.

00:33:36,617 --> 00:33:38,285
Then I've got engineering.

00:33:38,352 --> 00:33:39,887
So that's a couple hundred
thousand dollars.

00:33:39,953 --> 00:33:42,155
Um, we've got equipment
that we need.

00:33:42,222 --> 00:33:44,958
We need to buy a bluetooth
full development Stack.

00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:46,660
Those cost a minimum
of 50 grand.

00:33:46,727 --> 00:33:49,596
$500,000--That is
the absolute minimum

00:33:49,663 --> 00:33:51,398
I can take it
from point "a" to point "B."

00:33:51,465 --> 00:33:52,900
And there's a little bit
of cushion in there,

00:33:52,966 --> 00:33:55,002
but to be honest,
I'd like a little bit more.

00:33:55,068 --> 00:33:56,870
But $500,000 is
a lot of money.

00:33:56,937 --> 00:33:58,972
Absolutely. But for a product
like this--

00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,841
Now don't think--'cause, you
know, a lot of people think

00:34:00,908 --> 00:34:02,776
'cause you're sitting up here
with us that that's easy.

00:34:02,843 --> 00:34:04,978
That's a lot of money.
No, I don't think
it's easy at all.

00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:07,147
I haven't raised it yet.
(chuckles)

00:34:07,214 --> 00:34:09,116
So agree with me on this.
Yeah.

00:34:09,183 --> 00:34:12,386
The entire value of this concept

00:34:12,452 --> 00:34:14,788
is hinging on a deal
with black &amp; Decker.

00:34:14,855 --> 00:34:18,292
Absolutely not.
Okay, that's one channel.

00:34:18,358 --> 00:34:20,861
Anything in access control
we can go into.

00:34:20,928 --> 00:34:22,729
I'm not putting all my eggs
in that one basket,

00:34:22,796 --> 00:34:24,298
but it's a great opportunity,

00:34:24,364 --> 00:34:26,066
and they're
extremely interested.

00:34:26,133 --> 00:34:29,503
So my only Risk is
put some money in, develop it,

00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:31,271
make sure it works?

00:34:31,338 --> 00:34:33,073
I'm gonna make sure
you get your money back

00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,975
if I have to sell 'em
all by myself.

00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:39,813
How?
How are you gonna assure us

00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,849
we're gonna get our money back?
He's a hustler.

00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:43,150
I'm gonna make it happen.

00:34:43,217 --> 00:34:44,651
I come from
the private equity field.

00:34:44,718 --> 00:34:46,486
I'm actually--I have my degree
in Electrical engineering

00:34:46,553 --> 00:34:48,121
from the university
of central Florida. Go, knights.

00:34:48,188 --> 00:34:50,390
Okay, I come from
the private equity field.

00:34:50,457 --> 00:34:52,059
Literally,
in the private equity firm,

00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:55,195
my title was V.P. Of m.I.H.
I made it happen.

00:34:55,262 --> 00:34:57,764
Oh, I love that.
I like it right there.

00:34:57,831 --> 00:34:59,967
All right, look,
I'm in great pain right now.

00:35:00,033 --> 00:35:02,069
Let me explain why. Okay?

00:35:02,135 --> 00:35:04,538
You're very credible,

00:35:04,605 --> 00:35:07,341
and I love your story about
making it happen

00:35:07,407 --> 00:35:09,076
and the fact you come
from the private equity world--

00:35:09,142 --> 00:35:10,611
That's all plus.

00:35:10,677 --> 00:35:12,846
On the negative side,

00:35:12,913 --> 00:35:15,048
the housing market is
a disaster.

00:35:15,115 --> 00:35:17,818
Your product costs
Three times as much

00:35:17,885 --> 00:35:20,854
as the solution that goes
in every door today.

00:35:20,921 --> 00:35:23,790
We've got a lot
of development risk,

00:35:23,857 --> 00:35:26,560
and if black &amp; Decker passes,

00:35:26,627 --> 00:35:28,529
we have to market this
ourselves.

00:35:28,595 --> 00:35:30,097
So there's a lot of angst.
I've got--

00:35:30,163 --> 00:35:32,199
There's not a lot
of development risk.

00:35:32,266 --> 00:35:34,768
Everything I have planned out,
we know what we're gonna do.

00:35:34,835 --> 00:35:36,370
But hear me out--
We're gonna hit bumps
in the road.

00:35:36,436 --> 00:35:38,138
We're gonna solve
those problems.

00:35:38,205 --> 00:35:40,574
The hew home Market really
doesn't buy keypad locks.

00:35:40,641 --> 00:35:42,442
People put those on afterwards.

00:35:42,509 --> 00:35:44,244
So we're not directly linked
to the new home market.

00:35:44,311 --> 00:35:46,613
But there's many different types
of deals in life.

00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:51,118
This is one where I love
the story, but I feel the risk.

00:35:51,185 --> 00:35:54,454
But I want a piece of it,
so here's what I'm gonna do.

00:35:54,521 --> 00:35:56,356
I'll put $100,000 down.

00:35:56,423 --> 00:35:58,625
You still have to raise $400,000
from other sharks.

00:35:58,692 --> 00:36:02,262
But I want the end deal to be
for 50% of the company.

00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:04,264
So 10%. You give him
100 grand for 10%.

00:36:04,331 --> 00:36:05,999
Precisely.
Thank you very much.

00:36:06,066 --> 00:36:07,968
You have to raise
the other $400,000 from us.
Thank you for your offer.

00:36:08,035 --> 00:36:11,205
Thank you.
So at least you got $100,000
from the bank of tank right now.

00:36:11,271 --> 00:36:13,407
It's better than
most people get,

00:36:13,473 --> 00:36:15,409
and it starts the juices
flowing, my friend.

00:36:15,475 --> 00:36:17,644
Okay. It's an offer.
Thank you.

00:36:17,711 --> 00:36:19,479
Phil, I love the fact

00:36:19,546 --> 00:36:21,849
that you love something
as Boring as locks.

00:36:21,915 --> 00:36:24,518
(laughs)
I-I've been in internet security
for 28 years,

00:36:24,585 --> 00:36:26,687
and I love it.
Nobody understands it.
It's Boring, yeah.

00:36:26,753 --> 00:36:29,423
But I love it. It's Boring
to everyone else except to me.

00:36:29,489 --> 00:36:30,524
Yeah.

00:36:30,591 --> 00:36:32,459
Here's what I'll do.

00:36:32,526 --> 00:36:36,663
I'll give you $1 million
for 75% of it.

00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:41,068
You keep 25%,

00:36:41,134 --> 00:36:45,172
but it's contingent
on Getting black &amp; Decker in.

I need 'em, too.
Proof of concept.

00:37:18,505 --> 00:37:20,140
But it's not
our only customer.
I need them to prove the market.

00:37:20,207 --> 00:37:22,342
Absolutely, but...
so $1 million.

No, no, no. Phil, did I say
it's our only market?

00:37:26,813 --> 00:37:28,248
Okay. All right.

00:37:28,315 --> 00:37:30,517
I'm saying We need somebody
to step up, prove the market

00:37:30,584 --> 00:37:32,019
so we can go sell it
to other people.

00:37:32,085 --> 00:37:33,253
And I'm very confident.

00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,055
$1 million. 75%.

00:37:35,122 --> 00:37:36,323
You keep 25%.

00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:37,591
That's a lot of equity.

00:37:37,658 --> 00:37:39,760
Are they gonna ask
for exclusivity?

00:37:39,826 --> 00:37:43,230
Uh, in the residential lock
market, let's be reasonable.
What other market is there?

00:37:43,297 --> 00:37:45,065
That's the largest market
there is.
We can negotiate that.

00:37:45,132 --> 00:37:46,733
Computer access, uh...
Yeah, But the residential
lock market is what, 80%--

00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,468
Bicycle locks.

00:37:48,535 --> 00:37:50,070
So who cares? He offered you
$100,000 for 10%.

00:37:50,137 --> 00:37:52,306
I mean, it's--
You gotta get $500,000.

00:37:52,372 --> 00:37:53,874
Fair point.
But thank you and thank you.

00:37:53,941 --> 00:37:56,009
Actually, mine's far less
diluted than his.

00:37:56,076 --> 00:37:57,144
It is.
You just--

00:37:57,211 --> 00:37:59,213
but it's still a lot of equity.

00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:01,748
Phil. Phil, I have an offer,
all right?
Okay.

00:38:01,815 --> 00:38:04,618
Because for whatever reason,
since you presented this,

00:38:04,685 --> 00:38:07,988
I'm gonna be annoyed every time
I pull out my key from now on.

00:38:08,055 --> 00:38:12,226
But I'm gonna give you
half of the $500,000

00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:13,794
for 25% of the business

00:38:13,861 --> 00:38:15,696
if you get mark cuban
to buy the other 25%.

00:38:15,762 --> 00:38:18,098
(laughs)

00:38:18,165 --> 00:38:20,100
Thank you for your offer.

00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:22,102
Why don't you see
what mark has to say?

00:38:22,169 --> 00:38:23,403
I'm waiting.

00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,905
So am I.

00:38:24,972 --> 00:38:25,906
(Barbara laughs)

00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:28,742
Phil, two words--

00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:30,344
Great presentation.
Thank you.

00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,613
Um, I want to be
in this tech space really bad,

00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:34,147
but I have some exit wounds

00:38:34,214 --> 00:38:36,550
from other deals I've done.

00:38:36,617 --> 00:38:39,219
I have a partnership with great
product development people.

00:38:39,286 --> 00:38:41,922
If we use my people--and I have
a deal with hsn--

00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:43,757
We try to go right on there.

00:38:43,824 --> 00:38:45,759
Whoa. Are--Are you ready
with an offer?

00:38:45,826 --> 00:38:49,263
Yeah. 40%,
half a million dollars.

00:38:51,965 --> 00:38:53,200
And then there was one.

00:38:53,267 --> 00:38:54,668
(chuckles)

00:38:54,735 --> 00:38:56,670
Okay, I'll make it easy.

00:38:56,737 --> 00:38:57,838
Thank you.

00:38:57,905 --> 00:38:59,907
I get it, so here's
what I want to do.

00:38:59,973 --> 00:39:03,177
And I'm gonna preface This
by saying

00:39:03,243 --> 00:39:05,646
when I make my offer,
I also understand

00:39:05,712 --> 00:39:08,415
that you're gonna have to
raise another $600,000.

00:39:08,482 --> 00:39:10,450
So what I'm gonna do is--

00:39:10,517 --> 00:39:12,653
Barbara, I love you, but--

00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:15,222
don't give me the "But."
It's not a good sign.

00:39:15,289 --> 00:39:17,691
This isn't your--
This isn't your wheelhouse.

00:39:17,758 --> 00:39:20,460
But Kevin's strength

00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:23,096
is in beating people
up over the numbers.

00:39:23,163 --> 00:39:25,966
And I like that about Kevin.

00:39:26,033 --> 00:39:27,201
That's why they call me
Mr. Wonderful.

00:39:27,267 --> 00:39:28,535
(laughs)

00:39:28,602 --> 00:39:31,738
So, Phil,
what I'm willing to do is

00:39:31,805 --> 00:39:35,576
I'm gonna take up Kevin
on his contribution,

00:39:35,642 --> 00:39:38,145
and I'll provide $400,000.

00:39:38,212 --> 00:39:40,848
So in aggregate,
it's $500,000,

00:39:40,914 --> 00:39:43,717
but assuming Kevin's willing
to go along with this...

00:39:43,784 --> 00:39:45,319
I'm in.

00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:47,988
We want 45% of the company.

00:39:53,026 --> 00:39:55,295
I came in here wanting to do
a deal with you, mark.

00:39:55,362 --> 00:39:56,997
I think this is
right up your alley.

00:39:57,064 --> 00:40:01,201
Would you two consider 40%?

00:40:04,805 --> 00:40:07,474
I'll split the difference
at 42 1/2%.

00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:09,743
(Robert) Phil, hang on a sec.
Hang on a sec.

00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:11,678
Key thing
in what Mr. Cuban said.

00:40:11,745 --> 00:40:13,347
You're gonna have to raise
more money.

00:40:13,413 --> 00:40:15,616
In his deal and O'Leary's deal,

00:40:15,682 --> 00:40:17,818
you're already diluted.

00:40:17,885 --> 00:40:20,087
You've already gone down to 55%.

00:40:20,153 --> 00:40:23,090
What do you think's gonna happen
in the next round?

00:40:23,156 --> 00:40:25,192
And they're pegging the value
of this business today

00:40:25,259 --> 00:40:27,728
at about a million bucks.

00:40:27,794 --> 00:40:29,963
I'm giving you
a higher enterprise value

00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,098
right off the bat,

00:40:31,164 --> 00:40:33,133
more cash, twice the money,

00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,935
and you're getting 25%.

00:40:35,002 --> 00:40:37,504
All right, would you be willing
to come down on your equity?

00:40:37,571 --> 00:40:39,306
I mean, you're at 75% equity.

00:40:39,373 --> 00:40:41,475
That's a massive number.
I understand.

00:40:41,542 --> 00:40:44,745
I-I-I avoid two rounds almost.
Look, you realize my point--

00:40:44,811 --> 00:40:46,446
My point to you is when
you go to the next round--
Phil, you can't do that deal.

00:40:46,513 --> 00:40:47,648
You'll be wiped out by the time
the second round hits.

00:40:47,714 --> 00:40:49,116
Well,
he's offering $1 million.

00:40:49,183 --> 00:40:51,652
Yeah, but the point is you
may need more than $1 million.

00:40:51,718 --> 00:40:52,953
We don't know
what's gonna happen.

00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,689
Phil, look, you know from
your background in tech,

00:40:55,756 --> 00:40:58,358
it's not about 2%, 5%, right?

00:40:58,425 --> 00:40:59,960
It's about the assistance you're
going to get

00:41:00,027 --> 00:41:01,662
and the opportunity
in front of you.
I completely understand.

00:41:01,728 --> 00:41:04,231
Right. So that's where it is.
And giving up more equity--

00:41:04,298 --> 00:41:06,500
That's what you're fighting
for, the equity, right?

00:41:06,567 --> 00:41:10,204
Look, 40%, we have a deal.

00:41:11,939 --> 00:41:15,008
Then how are you gonna protect
me in the next round?

00:41:15,075 --> 00:41:17,578
40% and I'll give you
two seats on the board

00:41:17,644 --> 00:41:19,513
so you have control over
the board of directors.

00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,548
So it's a balance of power.
What do you think, kev?

00:41:21,615 --> 00:41:24,318
That's a fair guy.

00:41:24,384 --> 00:41:25,853
With two seats.
You have two directors now?

00:41:25,919 --> 00:41:27,387
No, I'm the only
board director.

00:41:27,454 --> 00:41:29,189
So you guys have control
of the board,

00:41:29,256 --> 00:41:32,392
I have control of the stock.
It's a balance of power.

00:41:38,065 --> 00:41:39,132
Kevin?

00:41:41,068 --> 00:41:43,070
I'm in.

00:41:44,271 --> 00:41:47,875
I'm in as well.
You have a deal.

00:41:47,941 --> 00:41:49,676
Done and done.

00:41:49,743 --> 00:41:51,111
That's how we roll.

00:41:51,178 --> 00:41:52,846
He took the right deal.
(Kevin) Very impressive.

00:41:52,913 --> 00:41:54,848
It's the wrong deal.
It's the right deal.

00:41:54,915 --> 00:41:57,217
Do not negotiate black &amp; Decker
without me there.

00:41:57,284 --> 00:41:59,019
Yeah.
That's what he's good at.

00:41:59,086 --> 00:42:00,687
All right.
Okay.

00:42:00,754 --> 00:42:03,323
Thank you so much.
I appreciate your offer.

00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:05,225
Thank you so much. Thank you.
(Barbara) Nice job here, today.

00:42:05,292 --> 00:42:07,294
I really appreciate
your offer as well.

00:42:07,361 --> 00:42:09,329
I like that.

00:42:09,396 --> 00:42:10,497
It was a great deal for you.

00:42:10,564 --> 00:42:12,099
What did he call himself?
A problem solver.

00:42:12,165 --> 00:42:13,534
And he had a problem
right in front of me

00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,969
and he came up
with a solution like that.

00:42:16,036 --> 00:42:17,471
But, mark, I am annoyed.

00:42:17,538 --> 00:42:20,073
You couldn't have gotten rid
of me in a more gracious manner?

00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,308
Barbara, you ride in on a Broom,
you gotta leave on a Broom.

00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:23,577
You pick this guy--Oh, god.

00:42:23,644 --> 00:42:26,413
It was unbelievable to get
an offer from all the sharks

00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,216
and get them fighting,
but I feel like I got the best.

00:42:29,283 --> 00:42:32,019
I've got the two billionaires
backing me.
