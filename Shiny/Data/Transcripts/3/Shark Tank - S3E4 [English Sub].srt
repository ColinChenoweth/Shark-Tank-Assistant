Now you're probably asking
yourself, "What is a swilt?"

00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,059
Well, let me tell you.

00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:43,597
The swilt is for soccer moms
sitting on cold metal bleachers.

00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,032
It's for frequent fliers

two snaps in the front...

about the foot pocket

00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:28,976
is that it is lined
in Water-resistant nylon,

00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:32,145

so what would you do
with the money, ivori?

00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:18,392
We need
web site optimization,

00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,027
so what we'd do is
We'd change the WEB site around

00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,797
so that
it's search engine-friendly,

00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:26,266
and because I know, when
people know about his product,

00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:29,269
we are going to sell out
of what we have--

00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:32,539

Oh, no. I said we're in--
I have done, um, marketplaces,

00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,853
meaning I have gone
to a marketplace and--

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,120
flea markets,
that type of thing?

00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:50,424
Exactly, and people have said,
"you guys are too big for this."

00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,593
Like, we've actually been there
and people have come up to me

00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:55,028

"you guys are too big

00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:56,463

it's ugly, mark?

00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:32,699
I'm not saying it doesn't work,

00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:35,035
I think 13Th-century Monk,
Grim reaper.

00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:37,371
I think,
"if I put one of those on,

00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:40,174
I fall flat on my face
'cause I trip on it."

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,976

billions of dollars in snuggies.

00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:21,548
No, and the reason
you don't--
but, Lori,
you could get in now.

00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:23,884
The reason you don't
is because

00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:26,453
the market is just
completely saturated with it...

00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,089
the snuggie is dead?
You're kidding.
And the prob--
the snuggie is dead...

00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:31,091
but What about the swilt?
And the problem is,

00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:37,698
the swilt is really just another
iteration of the snuggie.

00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:40,300

absolutely not.

This is actually mobile.

00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:48,041
You can't take the snuggie
outside of the house

00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:50,711
or Someone would say you were--
looked crazy, right?

00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,479
You can actually
wear this out.

00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:54,948
I don't know if it's attractive.
I wouldn't wear it.

00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,617
I'm a diva and I wear it.

00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:59,853
Ivori, there's only one path
for you to get that money here,

00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,356
and it's daymond.

00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,291

00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,861
Ivori, uh, when you roll it up
into on-the-go mode...

00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:11,765
mm-Hmm.
As you've got it now, it looks
like you're wearing a tent.

00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:13,634
I don't find it attractive.

00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,968
I mean,
it just doesn't flatter you

00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:17,771
and you're a good-looking woman,
so I'd lose that roll

00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:20,874

to lose our rolls,

00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:21,975

is between you and daymond,

My name is Shelly ehler,

00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:19,600
I live in
Ladera ranch, california,

00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,335
and my business is show No.

00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:24,137
My husband Brian
is my high school sweetheart.

00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:26,974
We've been together
for 22 years,

00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,610
and now I'm a mother
of two adorable boys.

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,448
My boys Love
going to the pool...

00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,517
Kiss. Jump in.

00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,618
(yells)

00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,120
but it's always a hassle
to change them.

00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,556
The wet clothes
are stuck to them,

00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:45,292
and to try and get them off
while keeping them covered

00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:46,727
is really a challenge.

00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:49,630
And I came up
with a perfect solution.

00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:54,501
Right now I'm sewing every
single thing from my house,

00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:56,737
and it's a lot of work.

00:08:58,739 --> 00:08:59,973
I need help.

00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,875
The recession
hit Brian and I really hard.

00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:03,210
We owned a printing business

00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:05,412
that just was not
recession-proof.

00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:08,916
Brian and I had to sell our home
and we had to move.

00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,817
It's been
the most difficult thing

00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,086
I've ever been through

Mmm.
Group hug.

00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:35,509
Hi. I'm Shelly ehler.

00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:38,478
This is my son Max
and this is my son Clark

00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:41,381
and we're here to present to you
our show no towel.

00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:46,053
We're asking for $50,000
for a 25% stake in our business.

00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:49,423
I got this idea when I was
at the pool with my sons.

00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,058
They wanted to change
into their dry clothes.

00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:53,460
My older son asked me if
I would make him a towel tent,

00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:55,729
which basically means
to take your towel...

00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:57,164
and wrap it around them

00:09:57,231 --> 00:09:59,499
so they can change their clothes
without anyone seeing.

00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:02,269
Well, while we're waiting
for him to change his clothes,

00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:05,506
my little guy started
getting a little impatient.

00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:06,907
(mark and Robert chuckle)

00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:09,042
and it was one of those
kind of mom moments

00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,511
that you wish
you had four arms

00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:13,547
so you could hold Everybody's
towel and make everybody happy.

00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:16,517
And it got me thinking,
why not take a towel...

00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,086
put a slit in it.

00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:21,388
They can wear it
like a poncho...

00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:22,923
(chuckles)
and they can change

00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,459
without anyone seeing them.

00:10:25,526 --> 00:10:27,961
And then the name
just shot out at me.

00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:31,498
It's a changing towel,
it's a poncho, it's a show No.

00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:32,799
Heh.

00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:35,402
We made you some custom
"Shark tank" Show nos...

00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:36,637
Awesome.

00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:38,805
That the boys
are going to pass out.
Thank you.

I notice you wear purple a lot,

you get green.

Thank you.
It's the color
of your favorite thing.

See you guys.
(Robert) Bye.

00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:56,223
This idea is exploding,
and I need your help.

00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,425
I'm not just here
asking for money.

00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:01,562
Truly, I'm looking for a mentor.
You know how to do it.

00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:03,463
You've taken simple ideas

00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,299
and made multimillion
and -billion dollar companies.

00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:07,201
I've not one single doubt

00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:08,902
that working together,
we could do the same.

00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:12,039
Are you making these
at home by yourself?

00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:13,807
Primarily, I have been
making these at home.

00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:16,410
I've seen ponchos
like this before.

00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:20,214
I have seen, um, towels
with a round circle in them.

00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,216
The thing that I really like
about the show no

00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:25,452
is that it lays completely flat
and it closes up.

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,288
So if you were to lay it on...
the SAND or something like that,

00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,123
you would have
a complete towel.

00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,425
(Lori) Did you patent this?

00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:33,794
Yes. You know, I did not have
a lot of money to start this up.

00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:36,230
And I just kept thinking,
"how am I gonna do this?"

00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:39,700
and then the most incredible
thing happened.

00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:41,335
My husband and I
were selling our house,

00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:44,037
and a new neighbor
was moving in two houses down,

00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:45,739
and we were having
a going-away party.

00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:47,241
So as they're over,

00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,376
we're talking and she was
complimenting my drapes--

00:11:49,443 --> 00:11:50,911
I made custom drapes
in our house--

00:11:50,978 --> 00:11:53,213
and I said to her,
"So what do you do?"

00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,148
and she said,
"Oh, I'm a patent attorney."
A patent attorney.

00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:58,151
And I went, "Oh, my gosh.

00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,553
"This is meant to be.

00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,054
This is another sign,
this is right,"

00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:04,057
and we traded patent work
for drapes.

00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:06,293
You traded patent work
for drapes. Okay.

00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,661
Oh, you traded?
That's pretty cool.

00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:09,062
Wow.
I have to tell you,

00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:10,397
when I saw this idea,
I said, "This is huge.

00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:12,499
I've got to take this big."

00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:15,269
and then I thought,
"Okay, water parks.

00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:18,372
That's the perfect place
to showcase this towel."

00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:19,540
I came up with the idea

00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:22,409
of putting the custom name
of the park on the ribbon.

00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:24,178
Good idea.

00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,179
Good, Yeah.

00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,047
It's--makes
the perfect souvenir

00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:28,582
and great advertising
for the park.

00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:31,385
I've gotten accounts so far
with legoland california,

00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:34,054
six flags magic mountain.
It was a hit.

00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:35,556
How much do you
make the product for?

00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:37,658
It costs me $6.50
to make this towel.

00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:39,593
(mark) and you sell it
to the water park for how much,

00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,727
and at retail for how much?

00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:43,897
I sell it to the water parks
for $9

00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:45,399
and I sell retail for $19.99.

00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:48,168
And the water parks--
how big an order did they place?

00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:50,370
Oh, now we just started,
so it's not huge.

00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,506
My biggest order right now is
from legoland california,

00:12:52,573 --> 00:12:55,008
and they've placed an order
for 240 towels.

00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:58,145
So far I've sold $15,000.

00:12:58,212 --> 00:13:00,380
(chuckles)

00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,516
So, Shelly, there's a bit
of a problem here.

00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,451
$15,000...

00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,389
is pretty well a nothing Burger,
to be honest with you.

00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,425
Your enthusiasm is--is good,

00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:12,459
you know, I have to admit.

00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:13,961
But what's sobering are
the sales.

00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:16,630
You have
a very, very seasonal business.

00:13:16,697 --> 00:13:19,199
You have to stock heavy,
spend your capital,

00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:20,767
hope like hell
they sell through.

00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,636
The focused seasonality of that,

00:13:22,703 --> 00:13:25,005
I do not find attractive
as an investment.

00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:26,306
I'm out.

00:13:30,444 --> 00:13:33,547
Okay. Okay.
I want to also point out,

00:13:33,614 --> 00:13:36,016
when I first started, I thought
of it as seasonal as Well,

00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:40,954
until I realized that it is
the perfect bath towel for kids.

00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:44,958
Kids love using This towel
every single day at bath time.

00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:47,928
There are over 1,000 water parks
in the United States.

00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:49,930
I figure, if I can get
at least 50 of them,

00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:51,598
and I think--
and I know I can,

00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:54,701
if I can get at least 50 of them
to sell 20 towels a day--

00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:56,570
that's doable, 20 a day.

00:13:56,637 --> 00:14:00,040
They're open 3 months a year,
90 days. That's 80,000 towels.

00:14:00,107 --> 00:14:02,376
That's almost $1 million
in 3 months.

00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:05,245
You could sell
$1 million worth of towels

00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:07,548
just to 50 water parks?

00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:08,882
I think I can.

00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:10,817
Maybe.

00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:13,654
I love your passion.

00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:16,623
I mean, uh,
you're--you're so committed,

00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,493
but I've gotta be honest
with you.

00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:25,699
I'm not as excited about
the product as I am about you.

00:14:25,766 --> 00:14:27,401
I don't see it selling.

00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,670
I'm out.

00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:31,405
(mouths word)

00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:32,472
Let me ask you
the most difficult question.

00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,208
Yes.
You have
two beautiful children...

00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:35,209
yes.

00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:36,577
And it's a birthday.

00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:37,811
Right.

00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:40,581
The C.E.O.
Of a major corporation

00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:42,015
wants you to come out

00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:44,218
and make a presentation
to all their buyers,

00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:47,087
and the only day
that they can see you...

00:14:47,154 --> 00:14:48,088
right.

00:14:48,155 --> 00:14:50,824
Is on that birthday.
What happens?

00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:52,492
I will go and be part
of that meeting,

00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,994
and I'll tell you why.

00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:57,564
I shower my kids
with unconditional love.

00:14:57,631 --> 00:15:00,901
They are my life.
They are my everything.

00:15:00,968 --> 00:15:03,003
They know how much
I love them.

00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,671
It doesn't matter
where I am.

00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:08,141
They love <i>me </i>so much
and want me to succeed so much,

00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,743
They would push me
on the plane.

00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:10,744
(laughs)

00:15:10,811 --> 00:15:12,412
My husband is
so supportive of me,

00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,381
I would not be here
right now

00:15:14,448 --> 00:15:16,750
if it weren't
for all that support.

00:15:16,817 --> 00:15:19,920
I am not here standing alone,
I'll tell you that.

00:15:19,987 --> 00:15:22,823
You know, my husband and I got
hit hard with the recession.

00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:26,093
I've never been through
anything like that in my life.

00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,262
We've had
four REALLY rough years,

00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:31,198
and I have to say...

00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:33,400
(exhales deeply)

00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:36,570
Every tear I cried
and every prayer I prayed

00:15:36,637 --> 00:15:39,640
has brought me here, right here
to this moment in front of you,

00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:42,709
and I would not change
a single thing.

00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,077
I know it's meant to be.

00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:47,347
I like it, I mean, but the sales
are really challenging,

00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:51,618
and--and you're saying that
the company is worth $200,000.

00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:52,819
Okay, I-I understand

00:15:52,886 --> 00:15:54,321
that my numbers did not
reflect that...

00:15:54,388 --> 00:15:55,389
Yeah.
But I have to tell you,

00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:58,425
I have a call in
to a connection

00:15:58,492 --> 00:16:01,128
with--with Disney right now,

Well, Shelly...

00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:16,310

a ton of me in you.

00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,461
I love your drive.
I love your passion.

I-I relate to you.

00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:40,567
I've been on qvc for 14 years,
and I know what it takes, too.

00:16:40,634 --> 00:16:43,370
I started making
everything by hand.

00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:48,976
I like you so much that actually
what I'm going to do is,

00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:51,211

00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:17,070
okay.

Oh, my gosh.

00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,611
Yes.

00:17:24,678 --> 00:17:27,648
Is that you will put

00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:30,250
Yeah.

00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:33,987

Hold on. What's going on?

00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:52,272
Then maybe we need to do
$50,000 for 20%.

00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:57,010
The check's written, Shelly.

00:17:58,145 --> 00:17:59,513
Shelly let me just add
something here.

00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,583
I see a lot of potential,
and to me,

00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:08,255
that potential is worth more
than $50,000 for 25%.

00:18:11,859 --> 00:18:14,428
So I'll offer you $75,000...

00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:17,097

the advantage that I have

00:18:21,969 --> 00:18:24,204

00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:26,507

so much to offer.

00:20:28,028 --> 00:20:29,496

and he has--

00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:30,898
he really believes in it,

00:20:30,964 --> 00:20:32,799
and daymond has
all these connections, though,

00:20:32,866 --> 00:20:34,568
in terms
of his manufacturing.

00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:36,069
I'm disgusted.
She has what it takes

00:20:36,136 --> 00:20:39,506
to drive this business,
and, I feel, joined with her,

00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:41,408
we can take this everywhere.

00:20:41,475 --> 00:20:43,944
I already have five ideas
of how to make this even better

00:20:44,011 --> 00:20:45,245
than what it is.

00:20:45,312 --> 00:20:46,446
I just don't want to make
a mistake,

00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:48,615
'cause I know daymond has
those incredible connections

00:20:48,682 --> 00:20:49,950
in terms of Manufacturing.

00:20:50,017 --> 00:20:51,451

millions of towels a year.

00:20:51,518 --> 00:20:52,786
Yeah.

00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:56,657
You know what's best, baby.
Just follow your heart.

00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:58,625
You know. Babe, you know.

00:20:58,692 --> 00:20:59,993

in her emotion? Be honest.

00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:07,601
I love her emotion, but no.
I'm a businessperson.

00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:19,780

I'm gonna tell you this.

In life, there's only

to offer you $75,000 for.

00:21:30,057 --> 00:21:30,991
Right.

00:21:31,058 --> 00:21:32,192
Don't screw it up.

00:21:32,259 --> 00:21:35,929

for hearing me,

for getting it,
for believing in me...

with my heart...

00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,926
and I'm the owner
and founder of puppy cake.

00:24:18,992 --> 00:24:23,197
I'm seeking a $50,000 investment
for 25% equity in my business.

00:24:23,263 --> 00:24:25,799
I used to work
for a sales and marketing firm,

00:24:25,866 --> 00:24:28,068
and one of my clients made
cake mix for people.

00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:30,504
As I was looking at my Client's
old cake mix advertisements,

00:24:30,571 --> 00:24:32,339
I thought to myself,
wouldn't that be great

00:24:32,406 --> 00:24:33,841
if they made that for dogs?

00:24:33,907 --> 00:24:35,209
So I researched
canine nutrition,

00:24:35,275 --> 00:24:37,945
and I eventually developed
puppy Cake.

00:24:38,011 --> 00:24:40,614
Puppy cake is similar
to cake mix for people.

00:24:40,681 --> 00:24:43,951
You add egg, oil, and water,
mix it, and then bake it.

00:24:44,017 --> 00:24:46,420
Each box comes
with yogurt frosting,

00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:48,255
and all you do to that is
add water, whip it up,

00:24:48,322 --> 00:24:50,357
and top the COOLED cake
or cupcakes.

00:24:50,424 --> 00:24:53,126
One box of puppy cake bakes
six cupcakes

00:24:53,193 --> 00:24:54,828
or one 4-inch round cake.

00:24:54,895 --> 00:24:56,964
This is Minnie.
She's a 7-year-old vizsla,

00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,465
and she loves puppy Cake.

00:24:58,532 --> 00:25:01,034
(baby talk) Minnie,
would you like a puppy cake?

00:25:01,101 --> 00:25:02,002
(normal voice) Here you go.

00:25:02,069 --> 00:25:03,837
That is a wheat-free
peanut butter Puppy cake

00:25:03,904 --> 00:25:05,405
That's topped
with Our yogurt frosting.

00:25:05,472 --> 00:25:09,076
Puppy cake is literally the best
thing your Dog will ever eat.

00:25:09,142 --> 00:25:11,011
Why can't you just make
a regular cake?

00:25:11,078 --> 00:25:12,713
A regular cake is not gonna
be good for a dog.

00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:15,549
Uh, dogs have
unique digestive systems,

00:25:15,616 --> 00:25:18,952
and we've chosen ingredients
that will be safe for dogs.

00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:20,020
Do you have
any sales of puppy cake?

00:25:20,087 --> 00:25:21,488
Yes, I've been doing--

00:25:21,555 --> 00:25:22,923
Minnie.
Easy, Minnie.

00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:25,759
Minnie, come on, honey.
You'll get some later.

00:25:25,826 --> 00:25:26,994
I've been doing this
for about four years,

00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:31,665
and I've had over $80,000
in sales over the 4 years.

00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:34,468
What about last year,
Kelly?

00:25:34,535 --> 00:25:37,104
Last year, $23,000 in Sales.

00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:41,041
Is this through the internet,
or do you sell to stores?

00:25:41,108 --> 00:25:42,543
I do sell to stores.

00:25:42,609 --> 00:25:45,112
I'm at about 150 retailers,
and I am international.

00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:48,348
I believe that this is
a very viable product,

00:25:48,415 --> 00:25:50,250
and one reason why
I believe that

00:25:50,317 --> 00:25:53,453
is I have done almost
no advertising in 2011,

00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,156
and I've gotten some
really fantastic publicity.

00:25:56,223 --> 00:25:57,524
I've gotten featured
in "Modern dog" Magazine,

00:25:57,591 --> 00:25:58,592
"the bark" Magazine,

00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:00,294
"Pet Product news
international."

00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,328
Like, it's--
I've never heard
of those magazines.

00:26:01,395 --> 00:26:03,764
Those are dog Magazines.

00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,965
Dogs read them.
P-people who--

00:26:05,032 --> 00:26:06,333
(laughs)

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,702
Kelly, do people buy it
to really make the cake

00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:10,604
or as a novelty?

00:26:10,671 --> 00:26:12,239
They buy it to make
the cake.

00:26:12,306 --> 00:26:13,774
Isn't there a stretch here?

00:26:13,841 --> 00:26:16,510
The inconvenience of having
to bake a cake for your dog...

00:26:16,577 --> 00:26:18,779
my mother-in-Law makes
cookies for her dog.

00:26:18,846 --> 00:26:19,913
Yeah, but...
(Robert) she does?

00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,348
She does.
What percentage
of the population...

00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:22,649
she loves her dog
like a child.
Has time to say,

00:26:22,716 --> 00:26:24,084
"honey, let's not make
dinner for the kids.

00:26:24,151 --> 00:26:26,920
Let's make a cake
for the dog."

00:26:26,987 --> 00:26:28,422
(chuckles)

00:26:28,488 --> 00:26:30,090
Actually, nestle purina did
a groundbreaking study,

00:26:30,157 --> 00:26:32,025
and one of the facts that
they found was that

00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:35,128
43% of dog owners celebrate
their dog's birthday.

00:26:35,195 --> 00:26:36,997
Okay, but that's once a year.
That's True,

00:26:37,064 --> 00:26:37,998
but do they make them a cake?
Once a year.

00:26:38,065 --> 00:26:39,700
That could be one choice.

00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:41,101
Um, that's one way
to celebrate a birthday.
Well, you see,

00:26:41,168 --> 00:26:42,536
the problem with that...
the problem is...
(speaks indistinctly)

00:26:42,603 --> 00:26:45,839
Every year you get to sell
one package to one person.

00:26:45,906 --> 00:26:47,207
That sucks.
Well, imagine this, okay?

00:26:47,274 --> 00:26:49,910
There are 70 million households
in the United States alone

00:26:49,977 --> 00:26:51,211
that own at least one dog,

00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:52,346
so if we're getting
a potential--

00:26:52,412 --> 00:26:55,048
and every year
they buy one package?

00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:57,518
Well, if we only get
1 1/2% of all households

00:26:57,584 --> 00:26:59,319
who have dog owners,
that's a million boxes.

00:26:59,386 --> 00:27:00,787
Kelly, you've been
at this for four years.

00:27:00,854 --> 00:27:02,022
Yeah.
Why is it that you think

00:27:02,089 --> 00:27:03,257
you've only grown it
to be able to do

00:27:03,323 --> 00:27:06,293
$23,000 in business
over the past year?

00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,963
The thing that I lack the most
is capital and connections.

00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,098
I've never attended
a trade show

00:27:11,164 --> 00:27:13,333
because I don't have
the capital for it.

00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,968
I can't get
in front of distributors

00:27:15,035 --> 00:27:17,070
unless I go to trade shows,
and that's why I'm here.

00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:18,539
I'm seeking an investment
in order to be able

00:27:18,605 --> 00:27:20,774
to take my company
to the next level

00:27:20,841 --> 00:27:22,543
and attend trade--
but you could have called
distributors.

00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:23,944
I have called distributors,
but I can't--
and what did they tell you?

00:27:24,011 --> 00:27:25,946
I don't get
a return phone call.

00:27:26,013 --> 00:27:28,515
Have you tried to go
to dog pet stores

00:27:28,582 --> 00:27:29,850
and Places like that?

00:27:29,917 --> 00:27:31,919
Have you tried to cold-call,
walk in and just say,

00:27:31,985 --> 00:27:33,954
"would you be interested
in my puppy cakes?"

00:27:34,021 --> 00:27:35,189
a couple times I have.

00:27:35,255 --> 00:27:39,259
Um, sales is not really
my strong suit, and I--

00:27:39,326 --> 00:27:41,962
I noticed.
(Robert) Ooh.

00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:45,032
Kelly, I-I love my dog,
but I-I don't see the market.

00:27:45,098 --> 00:27:47,901
It's a novelty. I'm out.

00:27:49,236 --> 00:27:51,872
Kelly, you're saying
that a regular cake isn't good

00:27:51,939 --> 00:27:54,775
for a dog, but how many dogs die
from a piece of human cake?

00:27:54,842 --> 00:27:56,510
Not many.
Would you give your child

00:27:56,577 --> 00:27:58,679
something that you knew
was not good for them

00:27:58,745 --> 00:28:00,080
and that would upset
their stomach?
Yeah, but dogs aren't that dumb.

00:28:00,147 --> 00:28:01,849
They know what they should eat
and shouldn't eat.

00:28:01,915 --> 00:28:02,950
I don't think
there's anything

00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:04,218
that would actually
support that.

00:28:04,284 --> 00:28:06,153
A dog will eat, um,
they will eat something

00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,788
that's bad for them
that tastes Good.
Well, I know for sure,

00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:08,789
you can get a new dog
any time you want.

00:28:08,856 --> 00:28:09,957
That's for sure.
(laughs)

00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:11,825
Well, I can understand
how you may not

00:28:11,892 --> 00:28:14,194
personally empathize
with this product.

00:28:14,261 --> 00:28:15,996
No, I don't, actually.
You're correct,

00:28:16,063 --> 00:28:17,965
but if I thought I could
make money, I'd be all over it.

00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:19,399
I--
but this is a category

00:28:19,466 --> 00:28:22,069
that I've developed
and is Growing.

00:28:22,135 --> 00:28:24,071
Growing?
You got $22,000 in sales.
Have you done other--

00:28:24,137 --> 00:28:27,341
I know you--you're
definitely stuck on the idea

00:28:27,407 --> 00:28:29,076
that this is--
only happens once a year,

00:28:29,142 --> 00:28:31,011
but I can assure you,
many of my customers buy

00:28:31,078 --> 00:28:32,412
several times a year.

00:28:32,479 --> 00:28:35,048
Oh, Kelly, no, no, no.
This is so wrong.

00:28:35,115 --> 00:28:38,519
Thank goodness We've met.
I forbid you to go on.

00:28:38,585 --> 00:28:40,654
I heartedly disagree.

00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:42,256
Oh, my goodness.
It's insanity.
I believe that I can sell

00:28:42,322 --> 00:28:43,524
millions of boxes
of these each year,

00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,959
if I can get
a national distribution.

00:28:46,026 --> 00:28:48,095
Minnie is speaking to me.
I can speak dog.

00:28:48,161 --> 00:28:51,265
I'm listening, and she's saying,
"Please make her stop.

00:28:51,331 --> 00:28:52,966
<i>Please, </i>uncle Kevin."
(laughs)

00:28:53,033 --> 00:28:57,604
I howl at the moon for you.
Stop this madness. I'm out.

00:28:59,106 --> 00:29:00,440
I-I'll tell you
what I think.

00:29:00,507 --> 00:29:04,077
I-I love that you created
a birthday cake for dogs.

00:29:04,144 --> 00:29:05,345
I think that's great.

00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:08,348
I-I agree with Kevin that
the problem is--

00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:11,118
is you're too limited
in your market.

00:29:11,185 --> 00:29:12,920
People that have their dogs
love their dogs,

00:29:12,986 --> 00:29:15,022
and they will,
I agree with you...

00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:16,757
uh-Huh.
Spend a ton of money
on their dogs...

00:29:16,823 --> 00:29:17,758
uh-huh.

00:29:17,824 --> 00:29:19,259
But if you had a full range

00:29:19,326 --> 00:29:21,695
of specialty gourmet foods
for dogs...

00:29:21,762 --> 00:29:22,996
okay.
Which I think you should

00:29:23,063 --> 00:29:24,865
maybe leave here
and think about...

00:29:24,932 --> 00:29:26,099
okay.

00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:28,769
But being just
one birthday cake for dogs,

00:29:28,836 --> 00:29:32,339
I don't think that you're
there yet, so I'm out.

00:29:32,406 --> 00:29:34,408
Okay.

00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:38,579
Kelly, Kevin likes
to hear himself talk.

00:29:38,645 --> 00:29:42,115
Unless you can sell it on qvc,
Lori just shuts everything down,

00:29:42,182 --> 00:29:44,284
and it doesn't matter to her.
It's dead to her, so...

00:29:44,351 --> 00:29:47,087
that's right. Encourage her.
Encourage her to go to hell.
That's so not True, mark.

00:29:47,154 --> 00:29:49,356
(laughs)
The only place That's hell

00:29:49,423 --> 00:29:51,925
is listening
to your nonsense.

00:29:51,992 --> 00:29:55,996
What you have is, I think,
a good product...

00:29:56,063 --> 00:29:56,997
thank you.

00:29:57,064 --> 00:29:58,332
But you've had four years,

00:29:58,398 --> 00:29:59,600
and you didn't feel like...
mm-Hmm.

00:29:59,666 --> 00:30:02,169
Your back was
against the wall enough

00:30:02,236 --> 00:30:03,937
to break through
your personal barriers.

00:30:04,004 --> 00:30:04,938
Mm-hmm.

00:30:05,005 --> 00:30:05,939
You know, you told us--
told us that

00:30:06,006 --> 00:30:08,008
you weren't really
a salesperson.

00:30:08,075 --> 00:30:11,445
To me, that tells me that
you aren't committed enough

00:30:11,512 --> 00:30:14,748
to the product
to try anything.

00:30:14,815 --> 00:30:17,084
I can't see writing a check
for somebody

00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:21,288
who finds the excuse rather than
finds the opportunity,

00:30:21,355 --> 00:30:22,289
so for that reason,
I'm out.

00:30:22,356 --> 00:30:23,724
Okay.

00:30:24,992 --> 00:30:26,693
If I drop out,
you're not--

00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,962
you didn't train Minnie to piss
on the carpet, did you?

00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:29,997
(mark and Kelly laugh)

00:30:30,063 --> 00:30:31,098
No, no. She's very Polite.

00:30:31,164 --> 00:30:33,600
Yeah. I have two Puppies.
Uh... (chuckles)

00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:35,969
Where I came from,
the dogs have it pretty rough.

00:30:36,036 --> 00:30:39,072
They're usually out in the yard,
and, uh, their birthdays,

00:30:39,139 --> 00:30:41,041
we just take the lid off
the garbage can for 'em.

00:30:41,108 --> 00:30:42,843
(woofs)
So, uh...

00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:43,944
(laughs)
Yeah.

00:30:44,011 --> 00:30:44,945
And with That said...
ohh.

00:30:45,012 --> 00:30:46,413
I'm sorry. I'm out.

00:30:48,215 --> 00:30:50,951
Well, I really appreciate
your time and your advice.

00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:52,085
Go get 'em, Kelly.
You'll be all right.

00:30:52,152 --> 00:30:53,620
Thank you.
Good luck, Kelly.

00:30:53,687 --> 00:30:55,022
Later, Minnie.
(Robert) Thanks.

00:30:58,091 --> 00:30:59,927
Today I think the SHARKS saw
my biggest weakness,

00:30:59,993 --> 00:31:04,531
and that's where I allow excuses
to get in the way

00:31:04,598 --> 00:31:06,867
of Making my product Successful.

My name's Eric corti.

00:31:34,494 --> 00:31:36,163
My company is
the wine balloon.

00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:39,299
I'm seeking
a $40,000 investment

00:31:39,366 --> 00:31:42,936
for a 30% share
of my business.

00:31:43,003 --> 00:31:44,505
How many times have you said
to yourself,

00:31:44,571 --> 00:31:46,573
"I'd love to have a glass
of wine tonight,

00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,676
"but I'm not gonna open
that entire New Bottle just

00:31:49,743 --> 00:31:53,180
"For one or two glasses,
because I know it's gonna go bad

00:31:53,247 --> 00:31:55,549
by the time I'll have
a chance to get back to it."

00:31:55,616 --> 00:31:57,651
Well, my wife and I love
red wine,

00:31:57,718 --> 00:31:59,353
but it seems like
we've poured

00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:01,488
more red wine down
our kitchen sink

00:32:01,555 --> 00:32:04,024
as we've had to drink
in our house.

00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:06,059
The reason
all that wine goes bad is

00:32:06,126 --> 00:32:08,896
because those Primary wine
preservation devices out there

00:32:08,962 --> 00:32:10,797
just aren't very effective.

00:32:10,864 --> 00:32:11,932
You can pump the Heck

00:32:11,999 --> 00:32:13,967
out of those rubber
stopper-type devices,

00:32:14,034 --> 00:32:17,004
trying to create a vacuum,
but you can still see

00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,639
half or three-quarters
of a bottle of air

00:32:18,705 --> 00:32:21,141
still in contact
with your wine,

00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:24,444
and the consumer doesn't even
know for sure if it's working.

00:32:24,511 --> 00:32:27,247
I decided there must be
a better way,

00:32:27,314 --> 00:32:31,552
so I created the wine balloon,
and here's how it works.

00:32:31,618 --> 00:32:33,854
You lower the balloon in,
into the bottle,

00:32:33,921 --> 00:32:36,023
till it's just
at the top surface of the wine.

00:32:36,089 --> 00:32:39,359
You squeeze the grape cluster
to inflate the balloon.

00:32:39,426 --> 00:32:41,495
As soon as it touches
the side of the bottle...
(chuckles)

00:32:41,562 --> 00:32:42,930
It's completely sealed.

00:32:42,996 --> 00:32:45,499
We say, give it
two or three extra squeezes.

00:32:45,566 --> 00:32:47,267
Oh, that's cool.
Now that Seal is so tight,

00:32:47,334 --> 00:32:48,936
you can turn this bottle
upside down.

00:32:49,002 --> 00:32:51,672
That small bubble of air
in the bottom

00:32:51,738 --> 00:32:54,675
is the only Air now
That's in contact with your wine

00:32:54,741 --> 00:32:56,610
while it sits
on your counter like this,

00:32:56,677 --> 00:32:59,446
in your refrigerator,
or in your wine cellar.

00:32:59,513 --> 00:33:00,814
When you're ready
for another glass,

00:33:00,881 --> 00:33:03,517
you just squeeze the valve here
on top of the grape cluster.

00:33:03,584 --> 00:33:05,519
The balloon
completely deflates.

00:33:05,586 --> 00:33:07,721
You just take it out,
rinse it off,

00:33:07,788 --> 00:33:10,390
pour yourself another glass.
It's fantastic.

00:33:10,457 --> 00:33:12,392
It's the wine balloon--
the wine preserver,

00:33:12,459 --> 00:33:15,028
the only
wine preservation device

00:33:15,095 --> 00:33:18,365
you can absolutely see
and know that it's working,

00:33:18,432 --> 00:33:22,269
and I need your help to get it
to everyone who drinks wine.

00:33:22,336 --> 00:33:24,404
Is this patented?

00:33:24,471 --> 00:33:26,139
It's patent pending
right now. Yes, it is.

00:33:26,206 --> 00:33:27,508
Okay. When--when did you file?
Eric, can I see it?

00:33:27,574 --> 00:33:29,610
Absolutely. Pardon me?

00:33:29,676 --> 00:33:31,178
When did you file?
How long ago?

00:33:31,245 --> 00:33:33,514
Uh, I just filed recently.
About two months ago.

00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,549
It was provisional,
and now it's a utility patent.

00:33:35,616 --> 00:33:38,485
What is the rubber
that, uh, makes the bladder?

00:33:38,552 --> 00:33:41,488
Uh, it is
a medical-grade latex Material.

00:33:41,555 --> 00:33:43,924
Does it have any effect
on the taste of the wine?

00:33:43,991 --> 00:33:45,025
It does not. It has, uh,

00:33:45,092 --> 00:33:46,493
it gives off no taste
into the wine.

00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,996
We've had it, uh, tested
in a laboratory

00:33:49,062 --> 00:33:51,698
to, uh, confirm that--that
there's no, uh, transfer

00:33:51,765 --> 00:33:53,000
of any flavors or--

00:33:53,066 --> 00:33:54,268
how long do you think
it preserves?

00:33:54,334 --> 00:33:55,469
Let's just take a Bordeaux...

00:33:55,536 --> 00:33:56,603
mm-Hmm.

00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,272
Which is very sensitive
to oxidization...

00:33:58,338 --> 00:33:59,573
right.

00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:03,477
And you--have you tested to see
how long it would stay fresh?

00:34:03,544 --> 00:34:05,345
I mean, there's another system
That's very popular.

00:34:05,412 --> 00:34:06,346
It's a shot of nitrogen gas...

00:34:06,413 --> 00:34:07,347
mm-Hmm. Mm-hmm.

00:34:07,414 --> 00:34:08,549
And then you Seal it.

00:34:08,615 --> 00:34:10,250
Actually that balloon,
if you compress

00:34:10,317 --> 00:34:12,553
an inch and a half or so
to the side of the bottle,

00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:14,521
it will last
about three to four days,

00:34:14,588 --> 00:34:16,757
but the beauty is,
you can squeeze it again,

00:34:16,823 --> 00:34:18,192
if you're not gonna get
back to it.

00:34:18,258 --> 00:34:20,093
For most people
with common sense,

00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,229
they just want
to visually see

00:34:22,296 --> 00:34:23,497
and know, uh,
that it's working.

00:34:23,564 --> 00:34:25,365
The primary things
out there right now--

00:34:25,432 --> 00:34:26,600
nobody can really tell.

00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:29,069
You might say that gas is
a good preserver,

00:34:29,136 --> 00:34:31,605
but I can't ever see it
or tell that it's happening.

00:34:31,672 --> 00:34:32,639
Same with those pumps.

00:34:32,706 --> 00:34:34,675
I can't really see
that there's a vacuum.

00:34:34,741 --> 00:34:36,310
What is your background?

00:34:36,376 --> 00:34:38,011
My background is
construction management.

00:34:38,078 --> 00:34:39,479
Are you drinking
a lot of wine on the job?

00:34:39,546 --> 00:34:41,548
(all laugh)

00:34:41,615 --> 00:34:43,250
So how did you come up
with this?

00:34:43,317 --> 00:34:44,651
Well, I have a lot of ideas.

00:34:44,718 --> 00:34:46,720
I write 'em down
in a little spiral-Bound book

00:34:46,787 --> 00:34:49,356
that I keep with me all
the time, that I travel with.

00:34:49,423 --> 00:34:50,490
And how much have
you invested?

00:34:50,557 --> 00:34:53,694
I've invested roughly $65,000
of my own money.

00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,530
We just did a soft release,
uh, six months ago,

00:34:56,597 --> 00:34:57,564
just put it up
on our web site,

00:34:57,631 --> 00:35:00,100
with no real Advertising
or Marketing.

00:35:00,167 --> 00:35:03,103
Sold over 700 units
to some Retailers. Um--

00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:05,472
sold 700 units
at what price into retail?

00:35:05,539 --> 00:35:08,342
Uh, at $22 retail price.

00:35:08,408 --> 00:35:11,111
How--how, uh, much does it
cost you to make this?

00:35:11,178 --> 00:35:13,747
It costs me $6.50 right now.

00:35:13,814 --> 00:35:15,182
If you made 100,000 of 'em,

00:35:15,249 --> 00:35:17,985
the price could be $2.50
to make them.

00:35:18,051 --> 00:35:19,753
Very possibly.
You need a huge volume,

00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,555
and there's hundreds
of thousands of the ones

00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:22,890
that plunge air out
of the bottle sold...

00:35:22,956 --> 00:35:23,891
right.

00:35:23,957 --> 00:35:25,559
So here's a new idea.

00:35:25,626 --> 00:35:27,895
We take it to that company
and say,

00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:30,564
"Here's a better mousetrap
that replaces

00:35:30,631 --> 00:35:33,600
your air plunging system,
which doesn't work,"

00:35:33,667 --> 00:35:35,669
and I agree, it doesn't.

00:35:35,736 --> 00:35:37,638
I'll make you an offer.

00:35:37,704 --> 00:35:41,308
I'll give you $40,000
under one set of circumstances.

00:35:41,375 --> 00:35:43,577
I have no interest in going
into the MANUFACTURING business

00:35:43,644 --> 00:35:46,079
or distribution business
with you in this.

00:35:46,146 --> 00:35:48,348
I do believe
it's a better mousetrap

00:35:48,415 --> 00:35:52,653
to the number one selling
wine preservation device.

00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:55,689
I'll go with you
to that company, all right,

00:35:55,756 --> 00:36:00,494
and negotiate with you
a royalty deal,

00:36:00,561 --> 00:36:04,932
and I'll only get 30% of what
we make in perpetuity together.

00:36:06,466 --> 00:36:08,669
Now I'll give you
a different offer...

00:36:08,735 --> 00:36:09,803
okay.

00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,805
Because I don't agree
with Kevin.

00:36:11,872 --> 00:36:14,274
I don't believe that
you should be licensing this

00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:16,577
and going to a company,
because you're gonna just make

00:36:16,643 --> 00:36:18,312
a little teeny cut.
Right.

00:36:18,378 --> 00:36:20,447
I believe in going direct--
times a million times.

00:36:20,514 --> 00:36:21,682
Doesn't matter.
Sure it does.

00:36:21,748 --> 00:36:25,152
The Lion's share is in going
direct to the consumer

00:36:25,219 --> 00:36:27,588
because That's where you're
gonna make your highest margin.

00:36:27,654 --> 00:36:29,089
Right.
This is your baby.

00:36:29,156 --> 00:36:30,991
That's where you're gonna
make your money,

00:36:31,058 --> 00:36:33,861
so my offer, I'm curious,

00:36:33,927 --> 00:36:37,698
would you be interested
if I bought you out?

00:36:37,764 --> 00:36:38,899
Potentially.

00:36:38,966 --> 00:36:42,503
What if I gave you $500,000?

00:36:42,569 --> 00:36:44,638
Period.

00:36:44,705 --> 00:36:46,106
Straight up for the company.
I own the patent.

00:36:46,173 --> 00:36:47,174
I own the company.

00:36:47,241 --> 00:36:48,675
You go, Lori.

00:36:48,742 --> 00:36:51,512
Potentially.

00:36:51,578 --> 00:36:54,114
Eric, when was the last time
you held a check for $500,000?

00:36:54,181 --> 00:36:56,250
I have never held a check
for $500,000.

00:36:56,316 --> 00:36:57,618
What would that do
to your life?

00:36:57,684 --> 00:36:59,620
Uh, it would be incredible.
It would be fantastic.

00:36:59,686 --> 00:37:02,322
So here's a chance
with just one word...

00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:03,323
right.

00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:06,527
Yes. How could you say no?

00:37:06,593 --> 00:37:08,395
It's gonna change your life.
I'll tell you
how you could say no.

00:37:08,462 --> 00:37:09,897
You could think about
two years from now,

00:37:09,963 --> 00:37:11,298
when everybody is using
this device

00:37:11,365 --> 00:37:13,367
the same way they're using
the air plunger,

00:37:13,433 --> 00:37:15,102
and you'll say to yourself--
and you still won't have
a half a million-dollar check

00:37:15,169 --> 00:37:16,837
in your pocket.
And--and you have
no more upside to it--

00:37:16,904 --> 00:37:19,339
wait, Eric. Lori, what if
we work together,

00:37:19,406 --> 00:37:21,175
we increase the offer
a little bit? I'll go half.
So what you say is...

00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:22,676
we'll go to $600,000.
$300,000, $300,000.
You accept her offer,

00:37:22,743 --> 00:37:24,778
and you say,
"look, I'll--I'll take 3%."
You got it.

00:37:24,845 --> 00:37:26,480
Okay. Eric, I'm gonna change
the offer here.

00:37:26,547 --> 00:37:29,416
Eric, we call him
"The undertaker,"

00:37:29,483 --> 00:37:31,685
because he is where
businesses go to die.

00:37:31,752 --> 00:37:33,554
So not True, of course.

00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:36,356
What Lori and I have
just decided is,

00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:37,591
we'll go in this together,

00:37:37,658 --> 00:37:41,428
and we're gonna give you
a $600,000 check.

00:37:41,495 --> 00:37:43,430
Not $500,000.
A $600,000 check.

00:37:43,497 --> 00:37:44,698
What does he get
in the future?

00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:45,933
He gets $600,000 to inv--

00:37:45,999 --> 00:37:47,668
what does he get
in the future?

00:37:47,734 --> 00:37:48,569
He gets $600,000 to invest...
a brand-new home and a yacht.

00:37:48,635 --> 00:37:50,737
In any other great idea
that he has.

00:37:50,804 --> 00:37:52,339
He has an opportunity
to walk--
you don't get it.

00:37:52,406 --> 00:37:53,574
You know what that means?
Look, you have
an opportunity...

00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,575
you don't get it.
To walk in to your wife

00:37:54,641 --> 00:37:57,911
and say, "honey, guess what?
I'm successful.

00:37:57,978 --> 00:37:59,513
"I did everything
I dreamed of.

00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,515
Look at this.
A $600,000 check."

00:38:01,582 --> 00:38:04,651
but--but, Eric, in order
for you to be able to walk up

00:38:04,718 --> 00:38:08,355
to your wife and hand her
that $600,000 check

00:38:08,422 --> 00:38:10,591

Right now, Eric.
You're talking to a thief

00:38:43,957 --> 00:38:45,859
who steals the future.
Right now, Eric.

00:38:45,926 --> 00:38:47,694
And you're talking
to somebody...
this man is stealing

00:38:47,761 --> 00:38:49,496
the future from you.
Who can get this on tv.

00:38:49,563 --> 00:38:50,998
It doesn't even matter, Lori.
It's a highly
demonstrable Item.

00:38:51,064 --> 00:38:52,165
Lori. Lori.
It doesn't matter
what she does on tv.

00:38:52,232 --> 00:38:53,233
You won't participate
in any of that.

00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,601
This is a thief.

00:38:54,668 --> 00:38:57,171
How about we do that
with a 3% royalty?
It's not silly.

00:38:57,237 --> 00:38:58,972
Whoa.
Yes, my man.

00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:01,475
You're the man to know that
you have to keep your future.
Same thing.

00:39:01,542 --> 00:39:02,476
Mark?
Always keep a taste...

00:39:02,543 --> 00:39:03,477
mnh-Mnh.
Of your future.

00:39:03,544 --> 00:39:04,478
Nope?
Mnh-Mnh.

That's how you get rich.

What he's talking about,
if this works, is chump Change.

00:39:07,714 --> 00:39:10,817
He's stealing your future
from you. He's a thief.

00:39:10,884 --> 00:39:12,019
What if we give him
2% royalty?
That's exactly what's happening.

00:39:12,085 --> 00:39:13,420
No. No. No.
(mouths word)

00:39:13,487 --> 00:39:14,421
We're taking all the risk.
Yes right now?

00:39:14,488 --> 00:39:16,190
Say yes right now then...

00:39:16,256 --> 00:39:17,424
I would,
if you accept the 3%.
Because, you know, I'll--

00:39:17,491 --> 00:39:19,493
I'll tell you one thing.
I can't tell you how many people

00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,228
have come up to me
with great ideas,

00:39:21,295 --> 00:39:23,263
and they dickered
over, like, 1% or 2%...

00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:25,165
amen.
Oh, I agree. Yeah.

00:39:25,232 --> 00:39:27,100
And--and ruined the deal...
mm-hmm.

00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:29,102
And today they're
kicking themselves,

00:39:29,169 --> 00:39:31,505
because they're sitting
there with Nothing.
Pigs get fat.
Hogs get slaughtered.

00:39:31,572 --> 00:39:33,106
Well, let's do that.
They're sitting there
with Nothing.

00:39:33,173 --> 00:39:34,575
Let's not dicker over 1%,
and let's make it 2% then.

00:39:34,641 --> 00:39:36,476
I'm out.
Oh. (chuckles)

00:39:36,543 --> 00:39:40,013
Ohh.
Oh, look what you just did.
Ooh.

00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,682
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

00:39:41,748 --> 00:39:42,749
Uh, I'm--
y-you know...

00:39:42,816 --> 00:39:46,053
take our offer.
Take the $600,000.

00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:48,655
2% is not an option?

00:39:48,722 --> 00:39:50,090
There is no $600,000, Lori.
Uh, he said he's out.

00:39:50,157 --> 00:39:51,592
Mark is out.
Mark is out.

00:39:51,658 --> 00:39:53,694
Mark, would you come
back in if he s--
(mouths word)

00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,829
You better take that deal
right now.

00:39:55,896 --> 00:39:56,997
Don't forget my offer.
You don't want

00:39:57,064 --> 00:39:58,065
to walk out of here...
you don't seem like

00:39:58,131 --> 00:39:59,066
that kind of a guy.
No, I understand.

00:39:59,132 --> 00:40:00,067
I-I've had, uh--
with Nothing.

00:40:00,133 --> 00:40:02,503
Has anybody offered you
$600,000

00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:05,305
in a single check,
one time, bang?

00:40:05,372 --> 00:40:07,074
Have not. Have not.

00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,109
And this is
your defining moment.
Then why would you--

00:40:09,176 --> 00:40:10,110
you should take it.

00:40:10,177 --> 00:40:11,845
So where are we right now,
Lori?

00:40:11,912 --> 00:40:14,748
We're at $500,000, and if Robert
wants to go in with me,

00:40:14,815 --> 00:40:17,684
we'll be at $600,000.
No royalty.

00:40:17,751 --> 00:40:18,986
Okay.

00:40:19,052 --> 00:40:21,855
You wanna go 50/50?

00:40:21,922 --> 00:40:23,056
I'm gonna be out, Lori.

00:40:23,123 --> 00:40:26,226
(Lori) Oh.

00:40:26,293 --> 00:40:27,261
Now you're at 500k.

00:40:27,327 --> 00:40:28,262
Okay.

00:40:28,328 --> 00:40:29,263
Who else is left?
Lori, and, Lori,

00:40:29,329 --> 00:40:31,231
you can--you can back down,
too, right?

00:40:31,298 --> 00:40:33,066
If you want to go 400k--

00:40:33,133 --> 00:40:35,068
are you back in, if I go--
200--I'll--

00:40:35,135 --> 00:40:36,637
okay, now you're back in.
At 400k total,

00:40:36,703 --> 00:40:38,105
at $200,000 and $200,000,
I will go back in.
$400,000--$200,000 and $200,000.

00:40:38,172 --> 00:40:39,239
Hang on. So wait.
We're--

00:40:39,306 --> 00:40:40,274
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What happened there?

00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,276
Did you go down
to $400,000?

00:40:42,342 --> 00:40:44,745
We did, because mark decided
that we should.

00:40:44,811 --> 00:40:45,946
If he wanted back in.
He's aggravated.

00:40:46,013 --> 00:40:47,748
Mark are you in at $400,000
with Lori now?

00:40:47,814 --> 00:40:49,249
Yes.

00:40:49,316 --> 00:40:51,685
Well, daymond, would you
and Lori split at $500,000?

00:40:51,752 --> 00:40:53,921
I see you making
stupid decisions right now,

00:40:53,987 --> 00:40:57,424
and I don't want to be part
of that. I'm out.

00:40:59,893 --> 00:41:02,029
<i>Two sharks are out.</i>

00:41:02,095 --> 00:41:06,500
<i>Kevin's offer of $40,000</i>
<i>for a 30% stake remains,</i>

00:41:06,567 --> 00:41:09,903
<i>while mark and Lori's offer</i>
<i>has shrunk by $200,000</i>

00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:12,339
<i>in just minutes,</i>
<i>due to Eric's hesitation.</i>

00:41:12,406 --> 00:41:16,944
So where we are, Eric,
Lori and together will buy

00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:19,913
your company--
no debt, unencumbered.

00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,149
We own it. You have
a check for $400,000.

00:41:22,216 --> 00:41:23,817
Right.
Eric, think about
What's happened here.

00:41:23,884 --> 00:41:26,854
In the last few minutes,
$200,000 just disappeared,

00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,155
just like that.
Right.

00:41:28,222 --> 00:41:30,424
Are you gonna let
another $400,000 disappear?

00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:32,659
Can we make it--
(Lori) take it. Say Yes.

00:41:32,726 --> 00:41:34,728
Can we go to--back to $500,000,
and I'll say yes at $500,000?

00:41:34,795 --> 00:41:37,898
Say yes at $400,000.

00:41:37,965 --> 00:41:41,301
Don't walk out of here
kicking yourself.

00:41:43,971 --> 00:41:45,572
I made you an offer.
What are you gonna do?

00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:48,275
You'll take--

00:41:48,342 --> 00:41:50,077
all right. Yes at $400,000.

00:41:50,143 --> 00:41:52,412
(mark and Lori) Done.

00:41:54,882 --> 00:41:56,149
Congratulations.
Hey, thanks a lot.

00:41:56,216 --> 00:41:57,184
That's the best feeling
in the world.
Congratulations.

00:41:57,251 --> 00:41:59,653
Thank you and thank you.
Thanks a lot.

00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,054
You almost went to zero.

00:42:01,121 --> 00:42:02,422
You're right.
I almost did go to zero.

00:42:02,489 --> 00:42:03,423
Congrats, Eric.

00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:05,392
Thank you.

00:42:08,095 --> 00:42:10,197
I congratulate you
on stealing his future.
Exactly.

00:42:10,264 --> 00:42:11,932
That's what you did.
We didn't steal
his future.

00:42:11,999 --> 00:42:13,934
You absolutely did.
We made his future.

00:42:14,001 --> 00:42:15,469
Kevin, you're just--
you're just upset that...
his future could have been zero.

00:42:15,536 --> 00:42:17,104
You weren't in on the deal.
I--no, no.
I was never gonna deal.

00:42:17,171 --> 00:42:18,672
If he has kids,
they're going to college now.
I would have never done

00:42:18,739 --> 00:42:19,673
that deal.
That's right.

00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,141
That is the beauty
of the tank.

00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:22,075
I am a little disappointed

00:42:22,142 --> 00:42:24,144
that we didn't get it
for $600,000.

00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:26,413
We'll take it for $400,000,
but they are sharks,

00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,515
and they got a little bit more
of what they wanted,

00:42:28,582 --> 00:42:30,050
but I'll take that $400,000

00:42:30,117 --> 00:42:32,219
and, uh, make something happen
with it.
