Every morning,
I come outside,

00:02:08,555 --> 00:02:10,491
and there's garbage
all over the place.

00:02:10,557 --> 00:02:13,527
So I finally put my husband,
who's Mr. Fix-it, to the test,

00:02:13,594 --> 00:02:16,263

to solve this great mystery.

So my daughter and I
took it upon ourselves

00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:20,701
to investigate
What was going on.

00:02:26,306 --> 00:02:28,275
We got all geared up.

00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:33,947
We would sit there and wait

00:02:35,749 --> 00:02:37,518
raccoons.

00:02:37,584 --> 00:02:39,686
And now I needed
to come up with a solution.

00:02:39,753 --> 00:02:41,655

of having to clean up
our own trash,

of the problem is,

00:03:34,508 --> 00:03:35,642
is that we just don't have
any garbage can lids.

Maybe the garbage man
throws them away.

00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,219
Maybe the wind
blows the lid down the road

00:03:45,285 --> 00:03:46,687
and it blows it away.

00:03:46,753 --> 00:03:48,655
It's really disgusting and we've
been dealing with this for years

00:03:48,722 --> 00:03:51,625
so finally I became fed up
and I said, "listen, Buddy.

00:03:51,692 --> 00:03:54,394
"You better come up
with a solution

00:03:54,461 --> 00:03:56,163

to sleep."

00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,798
And you know the old saying.

"A happy wife
equals a happy life."

00:04:00,367 --> 00:04:02,636

00:04:02,703 --> 00:04:04,538
was go down to the local
home improvement store

00:04:04,605 --> 00:04:08,275
and buy myself
a replacement garbage can lid.

00:04:08,342 --> 00:04:08,642
But guess what?

00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:11,512
To my surprise,
when I got down there,

00:04:11,578 --> 00:04:14,148
that just was not an option.
No.

00:04:14,214 --> 00:04:15,549
Stop the madness.

00:04:15,616 --> 00:04:19,953
You see, the store--they want
you to buy just the garbage can,

00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,189
and I only needed the lid.

00:04:22,256 --> 00:04:24,992
So now I had to get
into macgyver mode here

00:04:25,058 --> 00:04:26,894
and I had to
create something,

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,464
and that's why I created
the last lid!

00:04:30,531 --> 00:04:31,632

00:04:31,698 --> 00:04:33,634

is a fabric replacement

00:04:35,836 --> 00:04:38,305
It's made of 100%
water-resistant

00:04:38,372 --> 00:04:42,342
polyester material, it fits
on most-size garbage cans,

00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:44,812
and it's very simple to use.

00:04:44,878 --> 00:04:47,714
You're gonna attach
the handles on both sides.

00:04:47,781 --> 00:04:50,050
I've added a velcro strap
on the one side

00:04:50,117 --> 00:04:51,819
for added strength
and security,

00:04:51,885 --> 00:04:54,288
and then there's
a metal clasp,

00:04:54,354 --> 00:04:56,190
which is the key
to the whole element,

00:04:56,256 --> 00:04:58,225
that connects to the handle
on the back side.

00:04:58,292 --> 00:04:58,659
So now guess what?

00:04:58,725 --> 00:05:01,462
Now you never have to worry

00:05:01,528 --> 00:05:03,664
about losing
your garbage can lid again.

00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,967
And that's why I can honestly
stand here and tell you today

00:05:07,034 --> 00:05:09,636
that this lid right here
will be the last garbage can lid

00:05:09,703 --> 00:05:13,474

(both) the last lid!

00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:20,714
So what's to stop a raccoon
from just peeling it right off

00:05:20,781 --> 00:05:22,649

00:05:22,716 --> 00:05:24,651
Let me just tell you--
little background for you.

00:05:24,718 --> 00:05:28,689
I've actually videotaped
my competition.

00:05:28,755 --> 00:05:29,823

00:05:31,758 --> 00:05:33,961
you watch a videotape, right?
Here I go.

00:05:34,027 --> 00:05:36,697

my 8-year-old Daughter's window.

00:05:36,764 --> 00:05:39,633

We look. We make adjustments.

00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,635

I've changed fabric,

00:05:41,702 --> 00:05:43,737

00:05:43,804 --> 00:05:44,638

00:05:48,108 --> 00:05:50,244
Raccoons get
very easily deterred.

00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,413
They try to get it, they can't
get it off in a couple seconds,

00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,982
they move on
to the neighbor's bin.

00:05:55,048 --> 00:05:57,951
I know it's sounds Crazy.
Swear to God.
Always--always deterred.

what sales do you have?

00:06:11,098 --> 00:06:13,267
At this time
we don't have any sales.

the value of this

00:06:27,281 --> 00:06:28,649
we actually feel that
that's an undervalue...

00:06:28,715 --> 00:06:31,652

00:06:31,718 --> 00:06:35,355
(Robert) That's Good.
That's good, right?

00:06:37,758 --> 00:06:39,293
what am I gonna find?

00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:42,262
You can buy a normal
garbage can lid online...

00:06:42,329 --> 00:06:44,798
but guess what?
For certain cans only.

00:06:44,865 --> 00:06:45,632
This is a universal fit.

00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:48,068
This will fit
on pretty much

00:06:48,135 --> 00:06:49,636
90% of all the garbage cans
that are out there right now.

00:06:49,703 --> 00:06:51,939
There's not a universal
garbage can lid?
No way.

00:06:52,005 --> 00:06:52,639
There are none,
is what you're telling me?
No. No.

00:06:52,706 --> 00:06:55,042
You know, the irony of it all
is that you're gonna have to do

00:06:55,109 --> 00:06:56,643
what I did if you really wanted
to solve this problem.

00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:00,481
All right? And that's
ultimately--I stared at it,

00:07:00,547 --> 00:07:02,683
I looked at it, I said,
"what am I missing here?"

00:07:02,749 --> 00:07:04,651
and then it hit me,
daymond--fabric.

00:07:04,718 --> 00:07:08,055
Why not make a fabric
replacement garbage can?

00:07:08,122 --> 00:07:09,690
It's universal,
it stretches,

00:07:09,756 --> 00:07:12,292
it works--
but, Kevin,
that's an awful idea.

00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:14,027
Then you got to clean it.
You got to wa--

00:07:14,094 --> 00:07:16,029
That's the best part!
Rain--if it rains,
it gets wet, it gets soaked.

00:07:16,096 --> 00:07:19,633
Yeah, what happens
when it rains?
Robert, this is
machine-washable.

00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,803
I want to take something
that was on my garbage outside

00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,371
into the house and clean it?

00:07:24,438 --> 00:07:27,107
Well, you can hose it off
with a hose outside as well.

00:07:27,174 --> 00:07:28,809
I have no interest
in this product.

00:07:28,876 --> 00:07:30,210
Come on, Robert.

00:07:30,277 --> 00:07:31,211
I think it's a bad idea.

00:07:31,278 --> 00:07:33,113

Don't bail out yet.

00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,382

00:07:47,127 --> 00:07:48,362
It's not a piece of garbage!

00:07:48,429 --> 00:07:50,397
Yes, you want
your logo on garbage.

00:07:50,464 --> 00:07:53,200
Come on! How do you not
see that's a bad idea?
Robert!

00:07:53,267 --> 00:07:53,634
But I can't believe
you're gonna bail out.

00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,869
You were
a stay-at-home Dad.

00:07:55,936 --> 00:07:57,404
What's that
got to do with it?

00:07:57,471 --> 00:07:58,639
Because I know
you've dealt with this!

00:07:58,705 --> 00:07:59,640
I'm out.

00:07:59,706 --> 00:08:02,609
Aw.

00:08:02,676 --> 00:08:04,645
Lori, I know
one thing about you.

00:08:04,711 --> 00:08:06,346
I watch you on qvc
all the time,

00:08:06,413 --> 00:08:08,782
and I know you don't
take "No" For an answer.

00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:11,118
<i>You </i>have
a can-do attitude.
So come on.
This is a great product.

00:08:11,185 --> 00:08:12,219
You have
a can-do attitude!
(Lori) I love your passion--

00:08:12,286 --> 00:08:14,121
Lori, come on!
I-I love your passion--

00:08:14,188 --> 00:08:15,856
Lori. Come on!
It's a great product.

00:08:15,923 --> 00:08:19,293
This is
a great product, Lori.
You have
a can-do attitude!

00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:27,468
<i>One shark is out.</i>

00:08:27,534 --> 00:08:29,303
<i>Kevin and Melissa</i>
<i>are really hoping</i>

00:08:29,369 --> 00:08:31,338
<i>that they can</i>
<i>get Lori on board.</i>

00:08:31,405 --> 00:08:33,407
<i>You </i>have
a can-do attitude.
So come on.
This is a great product.

00:08:33,474 --> 00:08:34,508
Here you go--busted.
(Lori) I love your passion--

00:08:34,575 --> 00:08:36,643
Lori, come on!
I-I love your passion...

00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,011
Lori. Come on!
It's a great product.

00:08:38,078 --> 00:08:40,147
I understand, I relate to you,
I know what it was like,

00:08:40,214 --> 00:08:44,518
but I can tell instantly if it's
a hero or a zero, and I'm sorry.

00:08:44,585 --> 00:08:45,519
Really?
Come on, Lori.

00:08:45,586 --> 00:08:46,820
I think this is a zero.

00:08:46,887 --> 00:08:48,922
I'm out.
Ohh, Lori.

00:08:48,989 --> 00:08:51,758
Hold on. We haven't even
talked about the market.

00:08:53,827 --> 00:08:56,663
There's over 200 million
garbage cans sold

00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,400
in the United States alone,
with 115 million households--
we already know--

00:09:00,467 --> 00:09:03,303
look, it's a given there's
garbage cans everywhere, right?
(Melissa and Kevin) Right.

00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:06,340
What you haven't gotten into
as you've prototyped this

00:09:06,406 --> 00:09:09,309
is what it costs to build, what
you think you can sell it for.
Okay, let's talk about that.

00:09:09,376 --> 00:09:11,678
Right. I mean, basically, our
production cost on this thing--

00:09:11,745 --> 00:09:14,314
cost Per Unit's gonna be
about $3.50 a Unit.

00:09:14,381 --> 00:09:16,016
How much you gonna sell for?

00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,085
So you figure $19.95 for 2.

00:09:18,152 --> 00:09:20,387
I don't like the numbers
right now.

00:09:20,454 --> 00:09:24,558
7 bucks to make it. You want to
sell it at $19.95 at home depot.

00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,493
They need a margin on that,

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,163
so they're gonna buy it
from you at 10 bucks.

00:09:29,229 --> 00:09:32,099
All right? That's $3
for me as the investor and you.

00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,168
Right.
That's not enough.

00:09:34,234 --> 00:09:35,502
I'm out.

00:09:38,806 --> 00:09:41,241
<i>Three sharks are out.</i>

00:09:41,308 --> 00:09:42,509
<i>Mark and daymond</i>

00:09:42,576 --> 00:09:45,179
<i>are Kevin and Melissa's</i>
<i>last chance for a deal.</i>

00:09:45,245 --> 00:09:47,247
I have some of
the same issues as Kevin--

00:09:47,314 --> 00:09:49,516
the fact that
there's not enough margin.

00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:50,918
You don't have enough
room to invest...

00:09:50,984 --> 00:09:51,919
right.

00:09:51,985 --> 00:09:53,187
To take it out into retail.

00:09:53,253 --> 00:09:56,089
Unlike Lori and Robert,
I think it's a good product,

00:09:56,156 --> 00:09:59,059
but you're gonna have to build
this business on a slow build

00:09:59,126 --> 00:10:00,060
as opposed to a rapid build.

00:10:00,127 --> 00:10:01,261
Sure.
Okay.

00:10:01,328 --> 00:10:03,964
I just don't think
it's ready to be accelerated

00:10:04,031 --> 00:10:06,667
and--and blown up into
something really big quickly,

00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:09,903
because of the lack of margins,
so for that reason, I'm out.

00:10:15,209 --> 00:10:16,743
Daymond, come on.
(daymond) yeah?

00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:20,147
If I may? Listen, seriously,
this--this is a huge issue.

00:10:20,214 --> 00:10:22,015
We've come up with
Some staggering numbers

00:10:22,082 --> 00:10:23,484
where at least 60% of people

00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,053
don't even have
a garbage can lid <i>period.</i>

00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,755
Well, the numbers are staggering
in various ways.

00:10:28,822 --> 00:10:31,291
$200,000 for the concept
of the company

00:10:31,358 --> 00:10:33,227
is a staggering number.

00:10:33,293 --> 00:10:34,728
The fact that
you have zero sales

00:10:34,795 --> 00:10:36,463
is Another staggering Number.

00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:39,633
What if I was to raise
the--the equity in the company?

00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,302
I'll give you one shot.

00:10:44,171 --> 00:10:48,208
Give me a number
and make it good.

00:10:49,376 --> 00:10:50,711
It's on you, baby.

00:10:50,778 --> 00:10:52,846
It's all you, baby.

00:10:52,913 --> 00:10:56,984
We'll do the $40,000.
Let's say we came in at...

00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:00,154
60% of our company to you.

00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,222
That's better than you expected
and you know it.

00:11:02,289 --> 00:11:03,991
Wow.

00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,262
I'm in.

00:11:08,328 --> 00:11:09,263
Whoo!
Congratulations.

00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:10,264
Yeah!

00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,632
We got the man!

00:11:11,698 --> 00:11:14,334
Daymond! Thank you very much.
Pleasure to meet you.

00:11:14,401 --> 00:11:16,270
Thank you so much.
Thank you, sharks.

00:11:16,336 --> 00:11:17,271
Congrats, guys.
(Robert) Congratulations.

00:11:17,337 --> 00:11:18,705
Thank you, sharks.
Thank you.

00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,145
Daymond, I can't believe
you did a deal

00:11:25,212 --> 00:11:27,214
for a fabric cover
for garbage.

00:11:27,281 --> 00:11:28,315
You know why?
Why?

00:11:28,382 --> 00:11:31,218
Because I was trying
to find a top for my garbage

00:11:31,285 --> 00:11:33,353
about a month ago,
and I could not find it.

00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,223
I could have sold you one
for a lot less than $40,000.

00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,992
(Kevin and Lori laugh)

00:11:41,061 --> 00:11:43,564
We thought we were done,
we thought we were finished,

00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,933
and then my old man daymond
came through for us

00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:47,301
from queens, New York.

00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:49,303
We love you, daymond.
You're a hometown boy.

00:11:49,369 --> 00:11:50,971
Thank you, daymond.

00:11:55,976 --> 00:11:57,544
<i>In season 1,</i>

00:12:01,281 --> 00:12:05,152
<i>for their product lightfilm,</i>
<i>a decal that lights up.</i>

00:12:05,219 --> 00:12:06,587
I'm in. All right.
Wonderful.

00:12:06,653 --> 00:12:08,555
<i>Let's see</i>
<i>what they're up to now.</i>

00:12:09,957 --> 00:12:12,059
Right after the show,
we got together with daymond,

00:12:12,126 --> 00:12:14,428
put together
a marketing strategy.

00:12:14,495 --> 00:12:16,263
We went from lightfilm
to powerdecal.

00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:19,833
Now powerdecal is a cordless
product that you can change

00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,636
from one lens to the other
throughout the year.

00:12:22,703 --> 00:12:24,738
It never quits.

00:12:24,805 --> 00:12:26,573
Today is such a big day.

00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,143
Powerdecal is
on the shelves of best buy.

00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:31,545
Daymond was instrumental
in getting our product

00:12:31,612 --> 00:12:34,047
placed at best Buy.
Doesn't get bigger than that.

00:12:34,114 --> 00:12:35,482
We were able to go secure

00:12:35,549 --> 00:12:37,551
all the major league
sports licenses--

00:12:37,618 --> 00:12:40,554
nfl, nba,
major league baseball, nhl.

00:12:40,621 --> 00:12:43,824
Not only that, but we have
250 different colleges.

00:12:43,891 --> 00:12:45,058
We did it.
You got it.

00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,226
All right.
Thanks.

00:12:46,293 --> 00:12:48,562
I would say in the next
two quarters We're probably

00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:51,165
gonna be doing at least
$5 or $6 million in gross sales.

00:12:51,231 --> 00:12:53,500
I mean, we couldn't have
done it without "Shark tank."

00:12:53,567 --> 00:12:54,601
This is the American dream,

00:12:54,668 --> 00:12:56,437
this is what "Shark tank"
is about,

00:12:56,503 --> 00:12:58,639
and it doesn't get
any better than this.

My name is Amanda schlechter
and I invented the ledge Pillow.

00:13:22,663 --> 00:13:27,968
I'm asking for $30,000 for
a 25% interest in my company.

00:13:28,035 --> 00:13:31,004
My beautiful model Martina
will hand them out

00:13:31,071 --> 00:13:32,706
so you can take a look
at 'em up close.

00:13:32,773 --> 00:13:34,875
Thank you, Martina.

00:13:34,942 --> 00:13:36,110
The ledge Pillow is

00:13:36,176 --> 00:13:38,345
a fully patented
WEDGE-type Pillow,

00:13:38,412 --> 00:13:41,582
specifically for women
with Breast implants

00:13:41,648 --> 00:13:45,352
or just large breasts, to lay
on their stomach comfortably.

00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:46,787
(sharks chuckle)

00:13:46,854 --> 00:13:49,189
it is the only wedge-type Pillow
on the market

00:13:49,256 --> 00:13:51,992
for women with Implants
or with Large breasts

00:13:52,059 --> 00:13:54,128
to just lay on their stomach.

00:13:54,194 --> 00:13:56,663
I had an AUGMENTATION myself

00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,766
and I couldn't sleep
on my stomach anymore.

00:13:58,832 --> 00:14:00,834
So I went
to the fabric store,

00:14:00,901 --> 00:14:03,370
borrowed my mother's
electric turkey-carving knife,

00:14:03,437 --> 00:14:04,638
and began to carve out

00:14:04,705 --> 00:14:06,774
the design
that you see patented here.

00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,710
Who knew we had
this big problem?

00:14:09,777 --> 00:14:11,678
It's a problem.
Thank goodness.

00:14:11,745 --> 00:14:12,946
I knew this was one

00:14:13,013 --> 00:14:14,848
that the guys would want
to get their hands on.

00:14:14,915 --> 00:14:17,050
How many women
have this problem?

00:14:17,117 --> 00:14:19,720
How many women would you say
have breast implants?

00:14:19,787 --> 00:14:22,623
Well, there are
5 to 10 million women worldwide

00:14:22,689 --> 00:14:24,558
that have breast implants.

00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:25,859
What? Really?

00:14:25,926 --> 00:14:26,960
That many.

00:14:27,027 --> 00:14:28,762
What about
naturally large breasts?
Absolutely.

00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:30,764
This--this--
what size increment
do we have to get to

00:14:30,831 --> 00:14:33,434
before the wedge Pillow
becomes a factor?

00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,936
"C" Cup and above, uh, really
would need the ledge Pillow.

00:14:36,003 --> 00:14:37,671
And how high can you go
in the alphabet?

00:14:37,738 --> 00:14:38,672
Well, to be honest with you,

00:14:38,739 --> 00:14:42,342
I think bra Sizes go up
to sort of double-k.

00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:43,877
In--in the U.S.--
Wow.

00:14:43,944 --> 00:14:46,613
What?
Amanda, would this work
on a double-k?

00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,783
Yes. The idea is to minimize
compaction here. It's not just--

00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:52,953
I'm trying to
visualize a double-k.
I bet you are.

00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,856
Okay. Ignore these guys.
No, no, this is important.

00:14:55,923 --> 00:14:57,691
(Lori) Have you sold
any of these?

00:14:57,758 --> 00:15:00,427
Oh, yeah.
Absolutely, absolutely.
How many?

00:15:00,494 --> 00:15:01,962
I've only sold 83 of them.

00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:03,864
83?

00:15:03,931 --> 00:15:06,500
Yes, 83 of them.

00:15:06,567 --> 00:15:09,670
I only had a WEB site up,
uh, since 2008...

00:15:09,736 --> 00:15:11,705
(Lori) 2008.
So it hasn't been
very long, and--

00:15:11,772 --> 00:15:15,142
since 2008?
3 years? You've been selling
for 3 years and you sold 83?

00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:17,511
I have absolutely no money
for advertising, so--

00:15:17,578 --> 00:15:18,712
no kidding.

00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:19,913
(sharks laugh)

00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,682
It could be
a fabulous product,

00:15:21,748 --> 00:15:23,851
but if you can't
let people know about it...
let me ask you something.

00:15:23,917 --> 00:15:26,854
Women with Big boobs--
do they sleep on their stomach?

00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,023
Sure.
Or do they--do they,
over a course of time,

00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,292
realize that hurts,
and they sleep on their backs?

00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:34,294
Well, they sleep
on their backs now

00:15:34,361 --> 00:15:35,796
if they don't have
a ledge Pillow.

00:15:35,863 --> 00:15:37,064
Well, because most of the guys
up here are married.

00:15:37,131 --> 00:15:39,466
I happen not to be,
so I've had the pleasure of...

00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:42,669
being with more than one woman
in the last 50 years.

00:15:42,736 --> 00:15:44,671
And how much
did that cost you?

00:15:44,738 --> 00:15:46,774
(laughter)

00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,877
Uh, way less than
it's costing you guys, trust me.

00:15:49,943 --> 00:15:52,546
And usually they sleep
on their back or their side.

00:15:52,613 --> 00:15:54,681
That's because
they don't have a ledge Pillow.

00:15:54,748 --> 00:15:55,783
(Kevin) Okay, but daymond--
now why wouldn't they just

00:15:55,849 --> 00:15:57,684
put a regular small Pillow
underneath them?

00:15:57,751 --> 00:15:59,453
Because it doesn't
stay in place

00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,722
and it doesn't have
the--the appropriate foam

00:16:01,789 --> 00:16:05,392
to keep, uh, you know,
sort of the uplift.

00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:07,995
Okay, so you've had
the patent granted? Correct?
Correct, Yes.

00:16:08,061 --> 00:16:10,164
Which is great.
So you've got an asset there.

00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,833
My concern is,
it's been three years.

00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:17,871
Well, to be completely honest,
I am a single working mom,

00:16:17,938 --> 00:16:20,674
and, uh, I have not had
the time or the money

00:16:20,741 --> 00:16:24,778
to devote to the ledge Pillow
that I had hoped.

00:16:26,513 --> 00:16:30,451
I appreciate your ingenuity.
There was a problem.

00:16:30,517 --> 00:16:32,886
You were trying to find
a solution...
Exactly.

00:16:32,953 --> 00:16:33,854
Which is great.

00:16:33,921 --> 00:16:36,757
I, personally,
when I look for a product,

00:16:36,824 --> 00:16:39,560
some of the most important
elements for me are

00:16:39,626 --> 00:16:41,795
broad appeal
to the mass markets,

00:16:41,862 --> 00:16:44,264
selling to
the largest audience that I can,

00:16:44,331 --> 00:16:47,000
and I think that your product
is just too niche for me.

00:16:47,067 --> 00:16:48,535
Well, I will tell you,

00:16:48,602 --> 00:16:51,171
the average bra size--and I was
actually shocked by This--

00:16:51,238 --> 00:16:53,841
is a 36dd in the U.S.
(Lori) Wow.

00:16:53,907 --> 00:16:56,243
So that would be--
so it's just--
isn't this the essence
of your problem?

00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,611
You start with a product

00:16:57,678 --> 00:16:59,813
that only 50% of the population
will buy anyway--Women.

00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,716
Then you say women with
Large breasts--smaller Subset.

00:17:02,783 --> 00:17:05,719
Then you say women with
Augmentations--even Smaller.

00:17:05,786 --> 00:17:07,855
Then it get worse, Amanda,
much worse--

00:17:07,921 --> 00:17:10,591
Only women that want
to sleep on their stomachs.

00:17:10,657 --> 00:17:13,627
Now we're down
to a universe of 83,

00:17:13,694 --> 00:17:15,362
and you've met 100%
of the market with your sales.

00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:17,064
It's over.

00:17:17,131 --> 00:17:19,166
Why don't you tell her
what you really think?
You know what?

00:17:19,233 --> 00:17:20,868
You're so nasty,
and at the end of the day,

00:17:20,934 --> 00:17:23,637
you and I are very similar.
We'd make very good partners.

00:17:23,704 --> 00:17:25,639
But it's a nightmare,
as you found out.

00:17:25,706 --> 00:17:27,674
You have lived a nightmare
since you brought this out.

00:17:27,741 --> 00:17:30,110
You've sold 83 Units.

00:17:30,177 --> 00:17:33,714
This product is not going to
make anybody here any money.

00:17:33,781 --> 00:17:37,251
And Lori can be very nice to you
and say that in a different way.

00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:39,520
At least with me
you get the truth.

00:17:39,586 --> 00:17:43,123
It's a dog. Stop wasting
your time with this. I'm out.

00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:46,960
I'll give you some advice.

00:17:47,027 --> 00:17:50,764
What I think you should do first
is change the name

00:17:50,831 --> 00:17:54,802
to something that has "Boob,"
"Breast," something in it,

00:17:54,868 --> 00:17:57,938
but because it doesn't have
a broad mass appeal,

00:17:58,005 --> 00:17:59,873
I'm--I'm out.

00:18:00,908 --> 00:18:03,844
Amanda, you're not
dealing with the facts.

00:18:03,911 --> 00:18:08,015
In 3 years, selling 83
is such a small amount.

00:18:08,081 --> 00:18:12,186
Women would have found you
if there was a demand for it.

00:18:12,252 --> 00:18:13,954
I'm out.

00:18:15,689 --> 00:18:18,192
You guys are my last hope.

00:18:21,128 --> 00:18:23,964
I don't know
how to market to this area,

00:18:24,031 --> 00:18:26,667
and you don't either...

00:18:26,733 --> 00:18:28,268
unfortunately.

00:18:28,335 --> 00:18:29,803
It's not my Area.
That's why I'm standing here.

00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,305
I respect that,

00:18:31,371 --> 00:18:35,008
but I-I can't add any value
to you, so I'm out.

00:18:37,978 --> 00:18:41,849
You're not an entrepreneur yet,
Amanda. You're a <i>wantrepreneur.</i>

00:18:41,915 --> 00:18:44,017
You want this
to be a company,

00:18:44,084 --> 00:18:47,354
but you don't want it bad
enough, and that's the problem.

00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,492
You just tell me
what to do, and--

00:18:51,558 --> 00:18:53,193
that sounds Good.

00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,262
It's the truth.
It's--it's the truth.
But it's not.

00:18:55,329 --> 00:18:57,798
It's not,
and I'll tell you why.

00:18:57,865 --> 00:18:58,866
You're not gonna be a person

00:18:58,932 --> 00:19:01,535
where if I write you a check
for $30,000,

00:19:01,602 --> 00:19:02,936
I can trust

00:19:03,003 --> 00:19:04,938
that you're gonna go out there
and just bust your Butt.

00:19:05,005 --> 00:19:06,974
You have to do what you have
to do to be successful,

00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:11,178

so for that reason, I'm out.

00:23:59,846 --> 00:24:01,882
IS THAT THE PREMIUM SIDE
OF THE TEA CATEGORY

00:24:01,948 --> 00:24:02,916
IF I LOOKED AT OTHER PRICING?

00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,417
THAT IS THE HIGHER END.
YES.

00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:07,087
HAVE YOU TESTED YOUR PRICE POINT
TO RAISE IT UP EVEN HIGHER?

00:24:07,153 --> 00:24:08,421
WE HAVE NOT YET.

00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:10,023
ACTUALLY, IF THERE'S
ANYTHING THAT WE GO UP

00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:12,759
AGAINST EACH OTHER ABOUT,
IT'S ABOUT THE PRICE POINT.

00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:13,793
YOU THINK IT SHOULD BE HIGHER?

00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,462
I TEND TO BE SOMEBODY
WHO LIKES LUXURY...

00:24:15,528 --> 00:24:16,529
YOU WANT IT HIGHER...
(Robert) I HEAR YOU.

00:24:16,596 --> 00:24:17,931

PERFECT.

00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,799
THIS IS LIKE
THE DOLCE &amp; gabbana of tea guys.

00:24:19,866 --> 00:24:21,668
How much money
have you raised,

00:24:21,735 --> 00:24:23,870
and is it your own money or do
you have external partners?

00:24:23,937 --> 00:24:27,207
We've invested $300,000 of
our own money in the Business.

00:24:27,274 --> 00:24:30,544
Wow. So you guys--
you--you believe.

00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:32,579
We are in.
We do believe.
We do believe.

00:24:32,646 --> 00:24:35,782
Just the 2 of you,
and you're 50/50 partners?
Yes.

00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,450
So what do you do
when you disagree?

00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,519
We've worked out a system.
We've worked out a system.

00:24:39,586 --> 00:24:40,587
What's the system?

00:24:40,654 --> 00:24:42,722
I win.
Shane is always right.

00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:44,291
(all laugh)

00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,760
He's all creative,
I don't step on his toes,

00:24:46,826 --> 00:24:49,329
and I do the business side,
and he doesn't step on my toes.

00:24:49,396 --> 00:24:52,499
Shane, what's the big plan?
Tell me the next five years.

00:24:52,566 --> 00:24:55,101
If I give you $250,000,
what's the plan?

00:24:55,168 --> 00:24:56,436
The Big plan is,

00:24:56,503 --> 00:24:58,872
this is just the beginning
of a lifestyle brand.

00:24:58,939 --> 00:25:01,708
I would really like to see
more of the accessories,

00:25:01,775 --> 00:25:04,878
some tabletop, there could be
some licensing down the road.

00:25:04,945 --> 00:25:07,614
What's the exit strategy?
How do I get my money back?

00:25:07,681 --> 00:25:08,848
It will be a liquidity event.

00:25:08,915 --> 00:25:11,918
We will sell this company
for four or five times earnings.

00:25:11,985 --> 00:25:13,720
You <i>do </i>know
what you're talking about.

00:25:13,787 --> 00:25:18,225
We agree that we can grow this
to $100 million in--in revenue.

00:25:21,027 --> 00:25:24,497
I think this is an incredible
story, but unfortunately,

00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:27,033
I'm already in that space
as an investor,

00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,768
and so I'm conflicted out.

00:25:28,835 --> 00:25:31,104
I wish that I was doing the deal
with you instead,

00:25:31,171 --> 00:25:32,772
'cause I'm losing my shirt
in the other space.

00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:34,474
You would not
lose your shirt with us.

00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:37,777
I-I know, but I can't, 'cause--
due to conflict, so I'm sorry.

00:25:37,844 --> 00:25:40,113
Regretfully, I have to be out.

00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,252
Guys, I'm a big fan
of what you're doing, too,

00:25:45,318 --> 00:25:47,854
but I live, eat,
and sleep my businesses,

00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:51,224
and I couldn't eat,
sleep, and breathe tea.

00:25:51,291 --> 00:25:52,826
So I wish you the best--

00:25:52,893 --> 00:25:54,728
I think you can be
a $100 million business--

00:25:54,794 --> 00:25:56,663
but I'm out.

00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,832
Daymond, you said
something that concerns me,

00:25:58,899 --> 00:26:00,600
'cause I'm thinking
of their story.

00:26:00,667 --> 00:26:02,502
You mentioned that you'd made
an investment in a tea company

00:26:02,569 --> 00:26:03,937
and lost your shirt.
What happened?

00:26:04,004 --> 00:26:05,872
I think the guy running it
is a bozo.

00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,841
These guys--
and I-I didn't know

00:26:07,908 --> 00:26:09,843
enough about it
to get into it,

00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,278
and I'm trying
to off-load it now.

00:26:11,344 --> 00:26:13,246
I think this is a great space.
That's why I got in it.

00:26:13,313 --> 00:26:14,848
You know, caffeine is the number
one drug in the world,

00:26:14,915 --> 00:26:17,584
and they're selling it.
Well, what I like
about this story is,

00:26:17,651 --> 00:26:19,119
although the Category's
not growing,

00:26:19,185 --> 00:26:20,554
it's also recession-proof.

00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,422
People that drink tea,
drink tea.

00:26:22,489 --> 00:26:23,857
True.
Tell you
what I'm gonna do.

00:26:23,924 --> 00:26:26,793
Um, I like the story,
I like what you guys are doing,

00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,028
but I don't like the value.

00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:36,836
You know, it's one
of those not-easy deals,

00:26:36,903 --> 00:26:38,104
which always troubles me,

00:26:38,171 --> 00:26:41,408
'cause viscerally I love
to just say "Buy it."

00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:43,176
go with that feeling.
(laughs) Yeah.

00:26:43,243 --> 00:26:44,477
Go with that feeling.

00:26:44,544 --> 00:26:45,712
Trust your instincts.
It's so compelling.

00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:47,447
I have an offer for you.

00:26:47,514 --> 00:26:50,750
$250,000, but I want 40%.

00:26:53,853 --> 00:26:55,121
Negotiate.

00:26:55,188 --> 00:26:58,158
I'm wondering if there's
any other offers on the table.

00:26:58,225 --> 00:27:01,695
I don't know, guys.
I love the product.

00:27:01,761 --> 00:27:02,963
You guys are great.

00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:05,765
Um, I-I hate to agree
with Kevin,

00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:08,702
but I think the Valuation
and his numbers are about

00:27:08,768 --> 00:27:10,437
where it needs to be today.

00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,405
I mean, you could prove us wrong
in two or three years,

00:27:12,472 --> 00:27:14,407
but today that's where
I would see it.

00:27:14,474 --> 00:27:16,376
Even at $1 million in sales
by the end of this year?

00:27:16,443 --> 00:27:17,677
Yeah, because, you know,
you're gonna make

00:27:17,744 --> 00:27:20,847
about $150,000, $200,000
at the bottom line.

00:27:20,914 --> 00:27:22,115
I'm giving you full value.

00:27:23,817 --> 00:27:25,252
I'm out.

00:27:25,318 --> 00:27:27,454
Okay.

00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,289
It's fabulous to be
an oprah gift pick,

00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,858
and I know how that
jump-starts your business.

00:27:31,925 --> 00:27:35,328
I'm not convinced that doing
this at the valuation

00:27:35,395 --> 00:27:38,431
that you've given would be
the right deal for me,

00:27:38,498 --> 00:27:42,535
and so for that reason,
I'm out.

00:27:50,343 --> 00:27:51,745
Come to daddy.

00:27:51,811 --> 00:27:53,213
We would love to be
partners with you.

00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,214
We really want
to get closer

00:27:54,281 --> 00:27:55,715
to the valuation.
Then do it.

00:27:55,782 --> 00:27:58,118
We have grown this company.
We've not just grown product.

00:27:58,184 --> 00:27:59,252
We've grown the brand.

00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:02,088
With qvc,
we started with one airing.

00:28:02,155 --> 00:28:04,858
Now They've asked us
to do five this year alone.
I believe you.

00:28:04,925 --> 00:28:07,794
The only competitor you have
right now is you.

00:28:07,861 --> 00:28:09,863
That's right.
It's a wide-open market.
My check is right here.

I'm willing to give you
$250,000.

00:28:12,766 --> 00:28:15,869
I want 40%, because I'm
a disciplined investor,

00:28:15,936 --> 00:28:17,871
and you want me
as a partner.

00:28:17,938 --> 00:28:19,105
We do want you
as a partner,

and we do think that We'd make
a great team Together.

Then let's do it.

00:28:22,842 --> 00:28:24,477

that I liked,

and in my house, if we can't
find what we want, we make it.

00:31:13,547 --> 00:31:15,348
So I made my own magnets out
of recycled bottle caps

00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,150
from my Uncle's
old-fashioned Coke machine.

00:31:17,217 --> 00:31:19,252
I drew up
some Really cool designs,

00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:21,988
like peace signs, balloons,
and flowers.

00:31:22,055 --> 00:31:22,989
I put them into the bottle caps,

00:31:23,056 --> 00:31:24,958
and I attached a magnet
to the back.

00:31:25,025 --> 00:31:26,526
My friends saw them,
loved them,

00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:27,928
and started going crazy,

00:31:27,994 --> 00:31:30,230
so I figured I came up
with a pretty awesome idea,

00:31:30,297 --> 00:31:32,432

snap caps--

00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,706
Thank you.

00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:41,174
Go, Mavs.
Go, mavs.

00:31:41,241 --> 00:31:42,175
(Diane) go, Mavs.
That's what I like.

00:31:42,242 --> 00:31:43,677
(laughs)

00:31:43,743 --> 00:31:45,412
(bradshaws chuckle)

00:31:45,478 --> 00:31:46,413
(Maddie)
So I took my snap caps

00:31:46,479 --> 00:31:48,748
into a local toy store
in Dallas,

00:31:48,815 --> 00:31:51,184
and I asked the owner
if she would start selling them.

00:31:51,251 --> 00:31:52,118
Within two hours,
they had sold out

00:31:52,185 --> 00:31:54,120
of all of our bottle caps
and necklaces,

00:31:54,187 --> 00:31:57,190
and that's when my company,
M3 girl designs, was born.

00:31:57,257 --> 00:31:59,426
I'm the vice president,

00:31:59,492 --> 00:32:01,494
and that means
when the president goes down,

00:32:01,561 --> 00:32:03,230
the vice president has
to step up.

00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,232
(sharks laugh)

00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,334
You know, Maddie's going
to college in a few years,

00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,337
and I'll have all--I'll have
all of this to myself.

00:32:10,403 --> 00:32:12,205
(mark and daymond laugh)

00:32:12,272 --> 00:32:15,275
now that I'm 15 and Margot is
helping me with snap caps,

00:32:15,342 --> 00:32:17,177
I decided that I wanted
a new jewelry LINE

00:32:17,244 --> 00:32:18,445
geared toward my age group,

00:32:18,511 --> 00:32:20,480
so my mom and I created
spark of life.

00:32:20,547 --> 00:32:22,749
Spark of life is
adjustable necklaces

00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:26,453
and stackable bracelets
for kids and adults of all ages.

00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:28,255
Have you been selling these yet?

00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,323
We've been selling
for about five years now,

00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:31,758
and we're in
over 1,000 stores.

00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:34,194
You're in 1,000 stores?
What? Whoa.

00:32:34,261 --> 00:32:35,662
We're all over the Nation.
Yes.

00:32:35,729 --> 00:32:37,163
And what are
your sales at now?

00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,733
Well, over the past 5 years,
we've hit over $5 million.

00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:40,901
(sharks) Whoa!

00:32:40,967 --> 00:32:43,270
Dang. (chuckles)
That's not too shabby.

00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,438
What were your sales last year?

00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,441
Our sales last year were
about $1.6 million.

00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,176
(laughing)

00:32:50,243 --> 00:32:52,612
(chuckles)
and where were you selling?
What stores?

00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:57,150
Uh, we sell to specialty stores,
So apparel stores, toy stores,

00:32:57,217 --> 00:33:00,487
a lot
of large department stores.

00:33:00,554 --> 00:33:02,188
What was your profit?

00:33:02,255 --> 00:33:04,424
Our--
um, $1 million.

00:33:04,491 --> 00:33:05,692
So, Maddie,
you're a millionaire.

00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:07,627
I guess you could say that.
At 15. (chuckles)

00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:08,728
Wow.
(chuckles)

00:33:08,795 --> 00:33:09,896
Dang.
She's also an author.

00:33:09,963 --> 00:33:11,164
Mm-hmm.

00:33:11,231 --> 00:33:12,532
An author? What do you write?

00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:15,168
Yes. Um, I wrote my own book
to inspire other kids

00:33:15,235 --> 00:33:16,836
to start their own business.

00:33:16,903 --> 00:33:17,837
Can I see the book?

00:33:17,904 --> 00:33:19,072
Yeah.

00:33:19,139 --> 00:33:21,241
How did you find
these 1,000 retailers?

00:33:21,308 --> 00:33:22,776
Like, do you have
a distributor?

00:33:22,842 --> 00:33:26,580
Well, we started off in just
a few local stores in Dallas,

00:33:26,646 --> 00:33:29,649
but then, um,
we just were approached

00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:32,185
by more and more stores,
and then we got a sales rep,

00:33:32,252 --> 00:33:34,287
and now I think we have about
ten reps that sell our--
mm-hmm.

00:33:34,354 --> 00:33:35,455
And where do you make them?

00:33:35,522 --> 00:33:36,756
Do you make them all
in your house or--

00:33:36,823 --> 00:33:39,492
they're all handmade
in our office in Dallas.

00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:42,162
Your first line, you said,
was the bottle caps,

00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:44,097
and that's what's
made for you

00:33:44,164 --> 00:33:45,865
the $5 million in sales,
correct?

00:33:45,932 --> 00:33:47,267
Yes.
Right.

00:33:47,334 --> 00:33:49,436
And then you are now going on
with what you feel is

00:33:49,502 --> 00:33:51,238
for an older, uh, girl...
yes.

00:33:51,304 --> 00:33:53,006
A more mature girl.

00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:55,442
We're a company.
We're not a one-hit wonder,

00:33:55,508 --> 00:33:59,346
so for us, it's always about
introducing the next thing.

00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,747
What are your margins?

00:34:00,814 --> 00:34:02,983
Um, snap caps,
about 75 cents,

00:34:03,049 --> 00:34:05,252
and, um, spark of life,
around $2.

00:34:05,318 --> 00:34:07,087
Good Margins.

00:34:07,153 --> 00:34:09,990
Who owns the business?
I mean, structurally.

00:34:10,056 --> 00:34:11,558
Do you guys all own it
together?

00:34:11,625 --> 00:34:12,559
Yes, we do.
Yes.

00:34:12,626 --> 00:34:13,560
Mm-hmm.
Including--the girls have

00:34:13,627 --> 00:34:14,561
ownership equity in it?

00:34:14,628 --> 00:34:16,029
Absolutely.

00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:18,265
One question that
I think is important--

00:34:18,331 --> 00:34:21,401
in this economy, jewelry has
been a very tough sell,

00:34:21,468 --> 00:34:22,836
so how do you feel that

00:34:22,903 --> 00:34:26,006
that has affected you
and your sales?

00:34:26,072 --> 00:34:27,607
It's a $10 piece of jewelry.

00:34:27,674 --> 00:34:30,777
(speaks indistinctly)
Is everything
at that price point--around $10?

00:34:30,844 --> 00:34:34,114
The most expensive thing
is $10.

00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,916
Hey, Maddie, why do you need
the money

00:34:35,982 --> 00:34:38,485
if you made $1 million
last year?

00:34:38,552 --> 00:34:40,787
You're asking for $350,000.

00:34:40,854 --> 00:34:42,489
Am I missing something?

00:34:42,556 --> 00:34:44,958
Um, well, we want it
for global distribution.

00:34:45,025 --> 00:34:48,228
We're looking for a partnership
to take us to the next level.

00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,901
So here's what I think.

00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:58,038
For 300k...

00:34:58,104 --> 00:35:00,106
I'd do a deal

00:35:00,173 --> 00:35:01,741
for 30%.

00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,615
Okay, I'm--I'm gonna
make you an offer.

00:35:08,682 --> 00:35:10,317
Okay. (chuckles)

00:35:10,383 --> 00:35:12,452
What I would like to do is,

00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:15,255
I would like to go in
with Mr. Wonderful here...

00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:16,256
ah.

00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:18,058
And...
what?

00:35:18,124 --> 00:35:20,927
Yep. I'm gonna go in
with Mr. Wonderful.
Are you okay, Lori?

00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:22,929
I-I--yes, I'm having a moment.
I'd be happy to have
your partnership...

00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:25,232
I'd like to go in
with Mr. Wonderful...
because of your talents
on television.

00:35:25,298 --> 00:35:26,900
Except he needs to be
a silent partner,

00:35:26,967 --> 00:35:29,336
and the silence starts now.

00:35:29,402 --> 00:35:31,171
(laughs)

00:35:31,238 --> 00:35:33,206
See how nasty she can be?
And what I'm going to do--

00:35:33,273 --> 00:35:36,009
well, before you guys
decide anything--

00:35:36,076 --> 00:35:37,477
Well, hang on. Let's hear
the offer from Mark.
(Kevin) Let's--Let's hear
the offer. Let's hear the--

00:35:37,544 --> 00:35:39,112
okay.
Lot of noise over here.

00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:42,115
We're gonna take 40%--I'm upping
a little bit--but I--

00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:43,316
ouch!
Wait.

00:35:43,383 --> 00:35:44,751
(mark) There's always a catch.

00:35:44,818 --> 00:35:47,821
But the catch is, I am going
to personally mentor you

00:35:47,888 --> 00:35:50,457
and help you get into qvc,

00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,692
into retail stores globally.

00:35:52,759 --> 00:35:54,828
I'll help take you everywhere,

00:35:54,895 --> 00:35:58,098
because it is very difficult
to get into qvc,

00:35:58,164 --> 00:36:00,867
and even more difficult
to stay on qvc.

00:36:00,934 --> 00:36:02,402
And I hope that together,

00:36:02,469 --> 00:36:06,172
you will have hundreds of
fabulous products you'll create.

00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:08,675
So, Maddie, Maddie, there's
a lot of hot air up here...

00:36:08,742 --> 00:36:12,112
(laughs)
But at the end of all
of that wonderful mentoring,

00:36:12,178 --> 00:36:14,514
was she's making a worse offer
than Kevin.
(Kevin) Are you gonna
make an offer or what?

00:36:14,581 --> 00:36:16,416
She wants 40% for $300,000.

00:36:16,483 --> 00:36:17,984
Huge value.
Now think about this.

00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:21,154
And I gave her my mentoring,
which is invaluable.

00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:22,556
And my connections.

00:36:22,622 --> 00:36:25,358
And I'm gonna get your cost down
by At least 30%.

00:36:25,425 --> 00:36:27,027
I thought you were
the silent partner.

00:36:27,093 --> 00:36:28,194
No, I'm gonna make some noise
about this.
(laughs)

00:36:28,261 --> 00:36:31,932
I think we can make
these things for 30% less.

00:36:31,998 --> 00:36:33,934
So our margins go up,
you make more money,

00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,436
and then you get that Ferrari
before you get a license.

00:36:36,503 --> 00:36:37,437
(Lori) I agree.

00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:39,773
You know, you want to be her
one day.

00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,942
There's no question about that.
(chuckles)

00:36:42,008 --> 00:36:45,345
What do you say to that offer?

00:36:46,813 --> 00:36:48,748
I wanna hear
What else is on the table.

00:36:50,984 --> 00:36:52,419
Good answer.

00:36:52,485 --> 00:36:53,687
Especially
from the Dallas man.

00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,021
Of course.

00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:57,257
And daymond, our fashion guy.

00:36:57,324 --> 00:36:58,925
(chuckles)
Well, let me clear the field.

00:36:58,992 --> 00:37:02,162
As painful as this may be
for me to say,

00:37:02,229 --> 00:37:04,497
there may be
some other sharks here

00:37:04,564 --> 00:37:06,866
that would be more beneficial
to you.

00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,602
I'm out.

00:37:08,668 --> 00:37:11,671
But thank you, though.

00:37:11,738 --> 00:37:13,073
Margot, you guys haven't
heard from me yet...

00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:14,874
(Diane) Yeah.
And that's intentional.

00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:17,677
Um, I don't want
to do business with Kevin.

00:37:17,744 --> 00:37:19,613
It doesn't matter what <i>you </i>want.
It's not your business.

00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:24,017
But Lori has some very specific
advantages that she offers.

00:37:24,084 --> 00:37:26,152
So why don't Lori and I
partner up?

00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:29,256
But 40% is being
a little bit greedy.

00:37:29,322 --> 00:37:32,259
I think we should
take the offer back to 30%.

00:37:32,325 --> 00:37:33,526
(Lori) All right. Done.

00:37:33,593 --> 00:37:35,061
I'll do the deal with Mark.

00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:37,097
Sorry, Mr. Wonderful.
Ohh.

00:37:37,163 --> 00:37:39,933
So the offer is that
Lori and I partner in together

00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,903
for $300,000, the cash
that you asked for,

00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,805
for 30% of the company.

00:37:45,872 --> 00:37:47,774
That--that's our offer
that I hope you take.

00:37:47,841 --> 00:37:50,243
But I wanna feel

00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:53,079
that Maddie feels that this is
a wonderful opportunity

00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:55,081
That's just come your way.

00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:58,251
I'm looking for that enthusiasm,
that excitement.

00:37:58,318 --> 00:37:59,920
But we haven't heard
from Robert, either.

00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,821
Know what? I'd like to speak,
'cause I haven't finished...

00:38:01,888 --> 00:38:04,925
well, hang on a second.
With my offer, 'cause you're not
in this thing right now.

00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:07,060
So let's just--
no, no. Hang on. I <i>am </i>in
this thing for a second.

00:38:07,127 --> 00:38:08,128
What do you want?

00:38:08,194 --> 00:38:10,530
I don't think Maddie Wants
to give up 30%.

00:38:10,597 --> 00:38:12,732
Correct.
Yes. Yes.

00:38:12,799 --> 00:38:15,101
I'd like to say a few things.
Hang on a sec, Kevin.
Am I right or not?

00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:17,237
(chanting) Shark fight.
Shark Fight. Shark fight.
What's your offer?
What's your offer?

00:38:17,304 --> 00:38:18,505
Yes. Yes.

00:38:18,572 --> 00:38:19,873
What's your offer?
That's the lack of enthusiasm.

00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,608
Yes. Yes.
(Lori) He hit it. Okay.

00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:24,277
Now Let's--hold on.
And then we're wide-open
to a counteroffer.

00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:26,246
I have not had a chance
to speak, and now I'm going to.

00:38:26,313 --> 00:38:28,248
First of all, I wanna
remind you of something.

00:38:28,315 --> 00:38:31,184
When you build a business
like the learning company

00:38:31,251 --> 00:38:34,120
to $1 billion dollars
and sell it for $4.2 billion,

00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:36,990
you learn a lot.

00:38:37,057 --> 00:38:39,359
So I'm saying that I should own
a piece of this business

00:38:39,426 --> 00:38:40,994
for what I know,

00:38:41,061 --> 00:38:43,597
but I'm having trouble
with the valuation metrics here.

00:38:43,663 --> 00:38:46,233
Because I'm also
a very wise financial investor

00:38:46,299 --> 00:38:47,867
and I know what you're worth.

00:38:47,934 --> 00:38:53,106
However, mark dropped it down
to 30% to stay competitive.

00:38:53,173 --> 00:38:55,242
I would do that deal again.
I'd drop it down--

00:38:55,308 --> 00:38:57,310
it's killing me to do it,
I have to be honest--

00:38:57,377 --> 00:39:01,581
but I'd do it for 30%, not 40%.

00:39:01,648 --> 00:39:04,651
And maybe, Robert,
just to keep things interesting,

00:39:04,718 --> 00:39:07,120
if you really wanna
be part of this,

00:39:07,187 --> 00:39:08,555
include you as well.

00:39:08,622 --> 00:39:10,557
I'll come in on that offer.

00:39:12,993 --> 00:39:14,694
Guys, with the exception
of daymond,

00:39:14,761 --> 00:39:16,329
you have four people
very interested.

00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:18,331
You pretty much get to write
your own ticket.

00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:21,334
So why don't you tell us
who you'd like to work With.

00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:22,669
Who do you wanna work with?

00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,409
Um...

00:39:29,476 --> 00:39:32,245

(Robert) Diane, there's
no secrets in the family!

00:40:04,744 --> 00:40:06,746
You're not "the family" Yet.
(mark laughs)

(mark) Margot's great.
It's a huddle.

00:40:11,851 --> 00:40:13,620
(Margot speaks inaudibly)

00:40:13,687 --> 00:40:14,588
No.
No.

00:40:14,654 --> 00:40:15,589
Okay. Never mind.

00:40:15,655 --> 00:40:16,957
I'm good.

00:40:17,023 --> 00:40:18,592
(whispers indistinctly)

00:40:18,658 --> 00:40:19,759
Okay.

00:40:19,826 --> 00:40:22,329
(speaks indistinctly)

00:40:22,395 --> 00:40:23,630
Three sharks,

00:40:23,697 --> 00:40:25,465
but...

00:40:25,532 --> 00:40:28,668
we want Robert, Lori, and mark.

00:40:28,735 --> 00:40:30,770
Big mistake.

00:40:30,837 --> 00:40:32,606
And at what percentage?
20%.

00:40:32,672 --> 00:40:33,607
20%?
Ooh.

00:40:33,673 --> 00:40:34,808
(Maddie) Nothing more.

00:40:34,874 --> 00:40:36,676
Nothing more?
Nothing more.

00:40:36,743 --> 00:40:38,511
(Lori) Mm. I think 20%...

00:40:38,578 --> 00:40:41,181
is Low.

00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:46,486
(Robert) Maddie, I wanna stick
to the 30%.

00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:53,760
(whispers indistinctly)

00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:56,129
Okay. We will--
(speaks indistinctly)

00:40:56,196 --> 00:40:58,598
tell me.
(all laugh)

00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:00,300
Margot, that always happens
when you're the youngest.

00:41:00,367 --> 00:41:01,735
(Lori laughs)
(speaks inaudibly)

00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:05,972
Fine.

00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:07,374
Okay, you have the offer
on the table.

00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,009
(Lori) What are you thinking,
Maddie?

00:41:09,075 --> 00:41:12,712
30%, but we want season tickets
for mavs games.

00:41:12,779 --> 00:41:15,181
(Lori laughs) Good one!

00:41:15,248 --> 00:41:17,717
Good one!
Margot, get a pair for me.

00:41:17,784 --> 00:41:18,585
Ask for...

00:41:18,652 --> 00:41:20,687
(laughs)
You can do it.

00:41:20,754 --> 00:41:22,656
Come on, mark.
You own the team.

00:41:22,722 --> 00:41:24,424
(laughs) Hey!

00:41:24,491 --> 00:41:25,792
Please?

00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:27,627
I'd give you season tickets,
but we're all sold out.

00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:29,763
But any time you wanna come sit
in my suite and hang out

00:41:29,829 --> 00:41:32,365
and bring the whole family,
bring friends, done.

00:41:32,432 --> 00:41:34,901

00:41:37,771 --> 00:41:39,372

Yes. Yeah.
Deal?

00:41:40,674 --> 00:41:41,608
Deal.
Deal. Done.

00:41:41,675 --> 00:41:42,976
(Robert) Done. All right!

00:41:43,043 --> 00:41:45,779
(laughs) Margot...
(speaks indistinctly)

00:41:45,845 --> 00:41:46,913
god, I love...
(speaks indistinctly)

00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,448
Awesome! Nice job!
Yes, you, too.

00:41:48,515 --> 00:41:49,749
I got screwed out of that one.

00:41:49,816 --> 00:41:51,418
They ran you over, man.

00:41:51,484 --> 00:41:52,953
Maddie, great job.

00:41:53,019 --> 00:41:54,187
Thank you.

00:41:54,254 --> 00:41:56,089
(all speaking at same time)

00:41:56,156 --> 00:41:58,358
(Diane) Oh, thank you, guys.
See you guys soon.

00:41:58,425 --> 00:41:59,793
(Diane and Maddie) Thank you.
Thank you so much.

00:41:59,859 --> 00:42:01,027
Thanks, guys. Great job!

00:42:01,094 --> 00:42:03,163
Amazing.

00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,832
(exhales deeply)

00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:08,268
(all laugh)

00:42:08,335 --> 00:42:11,605
That 15-year-old kid got
$300,000 from mark, Lori, and I.

00:42:11,671 --> 00:42:14,608
$300,000, tickets in a box,
and ran over you like

00:42:14,674 --> 00:42:17,110
the flea-bitten scurvy dog
you are.
(laughs)

00:42:17,177 --> 00:42:18,778
I'll getcha back, big boy.
I know you will.

00:42:18,845 --> 00:42:20,380
Don't worry about that.
Well, at least you'll try.

00:42:20,447 --> 00:42:22,782
Good job, man.
Good family, good people.

00:42:22,849 --> 00:42:25,085
I can't believe that we got
to pick our own partners.

00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:27,087
I never would've thought that
that would happen.

00:42:27,153 --> 00:42:28,655
We--I thought we were gonna
be lucky enough

00:42:28,722 --> 00:42:31,558
to get a deal from <i>one </i>shark,
and we got <i>three </i>with us,

00:42:31,625 --> 00:42:33,693
so that's great.
I'm really excited.
