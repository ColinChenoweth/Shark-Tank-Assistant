00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:58,378
Now just a few years ago
when I was a high school senior,

00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:00,747
I focused on two things--
having fun in the sun

00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:03,150
and trying to get
the cute girls to kiss me.

00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:04,952
Now I quickly found out
that these activities

00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,687
don't always mix Well.

00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:07,921
While playing in the sun,

00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:09,756
my lips would get dry
and chapped,

00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:12,259
and at that point,
no one wanted to kiss me,

00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:14,761
so I tried every lip balm
out on the market,

00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:17,431
and the only thing worse
than kissing dry, chapped lips

00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,766
are chapped lips that taste
like Cherry cough syrup.

00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,870
It's disgusting, so I knew
there had to be a better way

00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,339
to soften up my lips and ramp up
my game with the ladies,

00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,140

00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,922

00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,692

any sales of this stuff?
Wait, wait, wait.

00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,027
Just for the record,
I want to say... (chuckles)

00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,695
You know how
when you kiss someone,

00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:03,030
it can change your feeling?
This didn't change a thing.

00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:04,031
(men chuckling)
it confirmed--

00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,133
it confirmed it all.

00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,668
But you'll always
remember it, so...

00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:08,669
Oh, god.

00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:09,870
(chuckles) Yeah, so will
the whole world.

00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:10,938
(chuckles)
(Robert) Yeah.

00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:12,272
How does it work?
We had in our minds,

00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:14,641
we wanted it to Tingle,
we wanted it to change flavors,

00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,044
so a team of chemists came up
with our formulas.

00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,179
They're better
than anything out there.

00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:21,215
They actually work, and they do
the Tingle sensation.

00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:22,049
What about revenue?
What about sales?

00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:25,352
We've been doing this
just barely a year last month...

00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:27,020
(daymond) Here we go.
And we actually--

00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:28,956
(Robert and mark chuckle)
We hit a milestone for us,

00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:30,757
which is $80,000 in Sales.

00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:32,426
Total for the year, right?
Um...

00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:33,026
what do you think a business
that does $80,000 in sales

00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:35,262
is worth?

00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:36,897
Sales and a half.
Okay, so that would get you

00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:39,132
kinda into the $100,000,
$120,000 range...

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,367
sure.
And you're telling me

00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:44,004
your business is worth
a million dollars,

00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,039
because you want me
to give you $200,000 for 20%.

00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:48,041
Right.

00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,042
What's the problem?

00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:52,446
This.

00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:55,649
It's our new Vendor paperwork
That's setting us up with one of

00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:58,051
the largest drugstore chains
in the United States, walgreens,

00:06:58,118 --> 00:06:59,052
so...
Dallas, can I see it?

00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:01,421
Have they placed an order?
Is it a test or--

00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,056
can I see it?
Is it a test
or is it in every store?

00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:06,026
What they want to do is
roll us out in 7,500 stores

00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:09,530
for
Valentine's day promotion.

00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,900
$540,000 is what they're gonna
order in product,

00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,801
see how it goes.
What's it cost you

00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:15,035
to make one of these?
Yeah.

00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:18,539
Depending on volume,
between 86 cents and $1.

00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,807
And that's for one of them
or for--

00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:22,309
that's for the package
that you see right there.
Everything all together.

00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:23,777
The whole package of two?
Mm-hmm.

00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:25,045
And what are you gonna sell them
to--to your big retailer?

00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,047
We're wholesaling 'em
right now for $3 a unit,

00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,917
and then they're retailing 'em
at about $5.99.

00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:31,051
So how much will you make
on that order?

00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:34,154
We'll make $337,000.

00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,358
Dallas, how did you get
walgreens?

00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:39,526
Well, I went out
and tried to find people

00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:41,228
who knew people
at walgreens.

00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:44,865
We went to them, and they
brokered us in to walgreens.

00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:46,567
Mike, tell me
about the other $80,000,

00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,603
not the walgreens.
Who bought that $80,000?

00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,471
We sell on our web site,

00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:54,608
but we're in over 100
retail locations right now.

00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:55,976
Um, we actually just got
approved for--

00:07:56,043 --> 00:08:00,514
in 485 associated food stores
that we started distributing to

00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:01,849
two weeks ago.

00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,350
Where do you see it going?
We've got several ideas

00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:05,452
for other mix-and-match
Kissing products

00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,054
that we want to bring out
after the fact.
Like what?

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,123
The next thing that we have
is called kiss mists,

00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,560
and it's, like, a breath spray,
so it's the same kind of idea.

00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:14,561
Oh, that's cool.

00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:15,028
We want to roll out gum
as well,

00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:16,029
so you can do
the kisstixx Gum.

00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:17,030
That's actually very cool.

00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:20,067

Uh, it could just be

What an experience being
on "Shark Tank" Has been.

00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,393
Oh, my goodness. Amazing!

00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,830
Prior to "Shark tank,"
we sold 2,000 cakes in a year,

00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:14,902
and now we're averaging
over $100,000 in sales a month,

00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:17,738
and because of
this huge increase in orders,

00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:20,741
I was forced to find
a larger bakery.

00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:24,411
I've moved from my small kitchen
with four ovens

00:12:24,478 --> 00:12:27,748
to a much larger bakery
with Big walk-in ovens,

00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:29,550
and the production has
increased dramatically,

00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:32,152
from being able to bake
eight cakes at a time

00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:34,221
to about 160 cakes.

00:12:34,288 --> 00:12:36,390
One of my favorite things
is that I've been able to ship

00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:38,592
my cakes all over the country,

00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:40,327
even all the way up

Here you go.

00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:59,800
Look at that.
Thank you.

00:14:59,867 --> 00:15:04,371
Okay, so this is very cute.
Let's talk about what matters--

00:15:04,438 --> 00:15:05,539
money.
Do you have any sales?

00:15:05,606 --> 00:15:09,510
We do. Uh, overall we've had
about $72,000 in sales.

00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:12,779
In the past three months alone,
we've had over $34,000.

00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:14,948
What do you think you'll do
for the rest of this year?

00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:18,552
We're hoping to end the year
out at about $140,000.

00:15:18,619 --> 00:15:20,554
We hope to net about
$100,000.

00:15:20,621 --> 00:15:23,357
Great Margin. That's how
you start a small business.

00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:26,894
So are you living off this,
or this is a Hobby?

00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,429
Right now, for me,
this is a full-time job.

00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:31,698
Last year, I was
an ELEMENTARY art teacher,

00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:34,701
but I actually just found out
yesterday that I lost my job...

00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:37,538
Oh.
Wow.

00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,273
That sucks.

00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:41,341
So smart Baker will now be
full-time for me,

00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:44,344
and I'm gonna need
to make it work.

00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:46,446
One door closes,
another one opens, right?

00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:49,383
Are you selling
everything on a web site,

00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,551
going to trade shows?

00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,553
How are you actually
selling the product?

00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,354
Currently We're selling
them online,

00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:56,190
through mail-order catalog
with the aprons.

00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:57,858
We've done, uh,
some trade shows.

00:15:57,925 --> 00:15:59,259
What's your best seller?

00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:01,461
Currently our best seller
is the cupcake tower.

00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:04,565
We've done about $40,000
in Sales since October.

00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:05,766
What does it sell for?

00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:09,436
Retail, $59.99 to $64.95.

00:16:09,503 --> 00:16:11,972
I think what puts
our cupcake towers Apart

00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,974
is that it could be
for a big, grand event

00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,343
like a wedding,
but using our modular design,

00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,644
you could take off
a tier or two,

00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:18,812
and you have
a smaller structure,

00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:20,447
good for smaller parties.

00:16:20,514 --> 00:16:21,448
(Robert) Stephanie,
do you mind me asking

00:16:21,515 --> 00:16:23,217
how long
you've been married?

00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:24,952
Eight months,
but together ten years.

00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:26,553
So you went out
for ten years

00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,388
and have only been married
for eight months?

00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:29,389
That's his fault.

00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:30,457
(all laugh)

00:16:30,524 --> 00:16:32,292
Did--did you ever date
anybody else?

00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:33,527
Nope.
High school sweethearts.
No. Yeah.

00:16:33,594 --> 00:16:35,028
Wow. No kidding?

00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:36,363
The reason I asked is you have
such a great relationship,

00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,397
the way you finish
each other's sentences...

00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:38,565
(chuckles)
Without arguing.

00:16:38,632 --> 00:16:40,367
What is it with the syrup
all the time?

00:16:40,434 --> 00:16:44,505
Robert gets so sappy
on everything. My Goodness.

00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:46,807
Let's say you had the time
and the help to focus

00:16:46,874 --> 00:16:49,543
just on getting more sales.
What would you do?

00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,845
The first thing I would do
is the trade shows.

00:16:51,912 --> 00:16:53,447
When people see the product,
they fall in love with it.

00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:54,448
Yeah.
You know what, guys?

00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:55,749
I-I like what you're doing,

00:16:55,816 --> 00:16:57,718
but I think
I'm such an internet geek

00:16:57,784 --> 00:17:00,220
I'd probably have a hard time
on the retail side.

00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:02,556
You have a strategy there,
and I might be the guy

00:17:02,623 --> 00:17:03,857
to hold you back,
so for that reason,

00:17:03,924 --> 00:17:05,459
I'm gonna say I'm out.

00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:06,693
Okay. Thank you.

00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,529
Okay. Thank you.

00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:09,863
Now I buy
your premise that,

00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,799
the economy being soft,
casual dining dollars are down.

00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:16,170
I'm just wondering, though,
how do you scale this business?

00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:19,039
You're sort of on the cusp of
being a Hobby versus a business.

00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:20,507
Your valuation is not crazy.

00:17:20,574 --> 00:17:22,342
You're asking for a value
of $300,000

00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:24,978
on something
that might make $100,000.

00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:26,813
Trouble is, you gotta eat,
literally...

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,881
correct.
So you gotta pay yourself

00:17:27,948 --> 00:17:29,349
most of the profits,

00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:32,753
so for me, as an investment,
it's--it's very marginal.

00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:35,355
Not enough meat on the bone
to invest in it.

00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:36,757
I'm out.

00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:41,094
I know I can be
like Kevin sometimes,

00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:44,131
where I think I know
everything about everything...

00:17:44,198 --> 00:17:45,399
(chuckles)
But you don't.
You're not like me.

00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:46,934
But in this case...

00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,002
(chuckles) I actually don't know
that much about the baking

00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,305
and--and cooking business.

00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:54,474
I will definitely be a customer.
I just can't add value to you.

00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:55,475
Okay.

00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:56,577
I'm out.

00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:03,450
<i>Three sharks are out.</i>
<i>Daymond and Barbara</i>

00:18:03,517 --> 00:18:06,553
<i>are Stephanie and Daniel's</i>
<i>last chances to make a deal.</i>

00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,554
Are you making an offer?

00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:08,956
I'm not sure.

00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:14,561
So, Stephanie and Daniel,
I want to offer you

00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:18,765
the $75,000
for 40% of your company.

00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:22,269
Is that the only offer?

00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:24,705
It's the only offer
I heard.

00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:27,274
The only offer you heard.

00:18:27,341 --> 00:18:29,943
It's a hard one for me.
I could argue either side of it.

00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:30,978
Do you have any debt?

00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:33,347
(Stephanie and Daniel)
No. No debt.

00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:35,349
You know, I bought
a business in the tank here

00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:37,251
named Daisy Cakes.

00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:39,520
She had, for the year,
$3,000 in sales.

00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:45,225
Do you know she's been selling
$100,000 worth of cakes a month?

00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:46,560
Wow.
That's awesome.

00:18:46,627 --> 00:18:48,128
But I made a deal with her
that I was wondering,

00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:50,430
perhaps you might consider,
because it gave me

00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:52,199
an opportunity
to get the money back out,

00:18:52,266 --> 00:18:56,303
if you might pay me a f--
well, he'll call it a royalty.

00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:01,975
I'm calling it a return,
a 5% return on what you sell,

00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:03,844
and if you'd be willing
to do that,

00:19:03,911 --> 00:19:05,779
I was going to make
the exact same offer

00:19:05,846 --> 00:19:08,448
the guy who knows nothing
about baking just made,

00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:12,452
$75,000 for 40%, but let me
tell you what I do know.

00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,955
I know distributorship.
I know the baking business.

00:19:15,022 --> 00:19:17,090
I know the technology piece
of the food business,

00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:18,358
and I know
the marketing business.

00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:20,127
And she knows how
to kiss Butt and lie.

00:19:20,194 --> 00:19:22,396
(laughs) Oh.

00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:24,865
You understand the difference

00:19:24,932 --> 00:19:27,501
between the shark
and the Sharkette's offer?

00:19:27,568 --> 00:19:30,370
This one comes
with a 5% royalty on top of it.

00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:33,373
This one comes with everything
needed to make your business

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,210
a huge business quickly,
and let me tell you something,

00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:39,379
I could take your sales,
and I could quintuple them

00:19:39,446 --> 00:19:42,216
in a month, simply because I've
set up the network to do it,

00:19:42,282 --> 00:19:44,918
which was not easy to set up
and very expensive.

00:19:44,985 --> 00:19:47,387
This guy doesn't know a darn
thing about the baking business.

00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:48,622
You know what?
The only problem about this

00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:51,291
is that I don't remember
seeing Barbara

00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,260
around the thanksgiving table.
She's not family.

00:19:53,327 --> 00:19:56,864
She doesn't know what I know,
so she can basically tell

00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,132
her great resume and say
how much I don't know.

00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:00,934
She doesn't have a clue.

00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:03,070
So you're in
the baking business?

00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:05,105
I might be.

00:20:05,172 --> 00:20:06,940
I did fail to tell you
one thing.

00:20:07,007 --> 00:20:09,843
The royalty on--
is totally ended

00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,445
the minute I recoup
the investment.

00:20:11,512 --> 00:20:12,513
Tell them anything else
you want to tell them...

00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:13,647
I've told them everything.
'cause you--

00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:15,148
you seem a little desperate
at this point.

00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:16,450
Stephanie...
I'm not
the least bit desperate.

00:20:16,517 --> 00:20:17,451
(speaks indistinctly)
You haven't shut up

00:20:17,518 --> 00:20:18,552
since you o--made
your offer.

00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:23,190
This is why I love the tank.
You have two offers.

00:20:23,257 --> 00:20:25,459
What are you gonna do?

00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:29,763
I'm gonna counter
Barbara's offer,

00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:33,700
see if she is willing to do
$100,000 for the 40%

00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:36,270
with the 5% royalty.

00:20:38,372 --> 00:20:40,073
I'd have to say no on that.

00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:43,443
(mouth full) Wow.

00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:53,187
Does your previous offer
still stand?

00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:58,091
It's $75,000 for 40%

00:20:58,158 --> 00:21:00,060
with the 5% of sales
off the top

00:21:00,127 --> 00:21:03,564
until it's repaid,
definitely.

00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:06,400
You got a deal.

00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:07,367
I think we will take it.
(Barbara) whoo!

00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:08,368
There you go.
Yes.

00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:09,570
Whoa.
That was so exciting!

00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:10,537
(Stephanie and Daniel
laughing)

00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:11,538
(laughs)

00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:12,539
Mwah!
How about me?

00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:14,341
Oh.
He can dip you, too.

00:21:14,408 --> 00:21:16,210
No, no. I don't want a kiss.
I just felt left out.
He can dip you. (laughs)

00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,178
Yes. Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Congratulations.

00:21:18,245 --> 00:21:19,179
Great. The smart Bakers.
Thank you so much.

00:21:19,246 --> 00:21:21,315
(Kevin) Ohh.
I'm so excited.

00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,051
Yeah. (chuckles)
(high-pitched voice) Oh!

00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:26,353
(normal voice)
Got what we came for, baby.

00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,856
What were you doing putting
your nose in that business?

00:21:28,922 --> 00:21:30,390
I was gonna license it,
that's all.

00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:31,458
License it.
I don't like to lose,

00:21:31,525 --> 00:21:32,593
but I'm happy for them.

Hi. My name is Lyle schuette,
and I'm from Derby, kansas,

00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,623
and my product
is the heat helper.

00:22:02,689 --> 00:22:05,392
I am here today
to ask for $100,000

00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:08,629
in exchange for 50% equity
in my product.

00:22:08,695 --> 00:22:11,899
The heat helper is
an amazingly simple device.

00:22:11,965 --> 00:22:14,368
It saves energy and money,
especially in times

00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:16,370
when we need it now,
when the economy is tough.

00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:18,405
I came up
with the heat helper

00:22:18,472 --> 00:22:20,073
out of pure necessity.

00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,976
My wife had injured her back
and during her recovery

00:22:23,043 --> 00:22:26,313
asked if there was any way that
I could raise the Dryer up

00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,415
so when she did laundry
she wouldn't have to bend over

00:22:28,482 --> 00:22:29,816

00:22:29,883 --> 00:22:31,418

can you heat up
that end of the house?"

00:22:32,986 --> 00:22:35,989
now my mother--
she was a very smart woman.

00:22:36,056 --> 00:22:36,990
Now I remember back home

00:22:37,057 --> 00:22:39,092
on my parents' dairy farm
in wisconsin,

00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:41,428
my mother would take
her old panty hose

00:22:41,495 --> 00:22:43,230
and stick on the back
of the Dryer.

00:22:43,297 --> 00:22:45,999
Why? Because she could catch
the heat and the humidity

00:22:46,066 --> 00:22:48,635
that came out of the Dryer,
so during laundry day,

00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:50,637
our home was
a lot more comfortable.

00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:52,573
Now before I explain
how the heat helper works,

00:22:52,639 --> 00:22:55,676
you must first understand
how an ELECTRIC Dryer Works.

00:22:55,742 --> 00:22:58,679
An electric Dryer works
by pulling in air

00:22:58,745 --> 00:23:00,547
through the back of the unit,
heating that air up.

00:23:00,614 --> 00:23:02,816
Then it blows the air out
of your home.

00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:04,418
What a waste.

00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:06,920
Now what the heat helper does
is take that same amount of Air

00:23:06,987 --> 00:23:09,990
that your Dryer uses,
filters it,

00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:12,492
and then blowing it
back inside your home.

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,462
It pays for itself
in the first year.

00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:16,797
I call the Heat helper...

00:23:16,864 --> 00:23:18,999
(taps)
Common sense in a box.

00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:21,902
(Robert chuckles)
Now Let's do some Business.

00:23:21,969 --> 00:23:23,270
(mark, daymond,
and Robert laugh)

00:23:23,337 --> 00:23:27,374
first question I have to ask is,
if my wife hurt her back

00:23:27,441 --> 00:23:30,644
and I didn't volunteer to do
the laundry for her...

00:23:30,711 --> 00:23:31,812
(Barbara laughs)
I'd be black and blue.

00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:32,813
How did you get away
with that?

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,415
Well, I started
a dirt business,

00:23:35,482 --> 00:23:37,751
and I'm normally gone
all day long,

00:23:37,818 --> 00:23:40,053
and since my wife, at that time,
was a stay-at-home mom,

00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,221
it was all right for her
to do that.
She--she cut you

00:23:41,288 --> 00:23:42,422
some Slack, huh?
Yes, sir.

00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:44,625
Lyle, what's
a dirt business?

00:23:44,691 --> 00:23:47,794
I am a Terra firma RELOCATION
distribution Engineer.

00:23:47,861 --> 00:23:48,962
(sharks laugh)

00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:51,498
(chuckles) in other words,
I move a lot of dirt.

00:23:51,565 --> 00:23:55,335
I'm a drainage contractor,
and I sell topsoil and compost.

00:23:55,402 --> 00:23:57,871
Lyle, how did your wife
hurt her back?

00:23:57,938 --> 00:24:00,407
She fell in a hole of a pond
I was digging on our farm.

00:24:00,474 --> 00:24:01,875
(laughs)
I knew it was dirt.

00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:02,876
(chuckles)

00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:04,178
I knew it.
You didn't do that

00:24:04,244 --> 00:24:05,479
on purpose?
I told her to go left.

00:24:05,546 --> 00:24:07,214
No, I told her to go left,
and she went right,

00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:08,949
and next thing I know,
there she was.

00:24:09,016 --> 00:24:09,850
And then you made her do
the laundry.

00:24:09,917 --> 00:24:12,019
(laughs)
Oh, god.

00:24:12,085 --> 00:24:13,253
Dirt bites again.

00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,721
So--
did you help her out
of the hole,

00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:15,756
or did you build
something?

00:24:15,822 --> 00:24:16,823
In the words of my wife,
she never saw

00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,926
my old Butt move so fast.

00:24:18,992 --> 00:24:19,927
Ah! (chuckles)

00:24:19,993 --> 00:24:21,595
Have you had any sales?

00:24:21,662 --> 00:24:25,632
I've had 680 units sold,
all through the web site.

00:24:25,699 --> 00:24:27,668
How much does a unit cost?

00:24:27,734 --> 00:24:30,904
$99, and--and we have sold 'em
at Lowe's and at walmart.

00:24:30,971 --> 00:24:34,408
And how much can that save me
in my heating bill?

00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:37,644
Well, an average family
of four will save

00:24:37,711 --> 00:24:40,013
roughly $189 a year.

00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,949
Lyle, you said you were
in home--Lowe's?
Lyle, what--

00:24:42,015 --> 00:24:45,052
yes, we've been in Lowe's
for three years and in Walmart.

00:24:45,118 --> 00:24:47,721
How many have you sold
in the last year?

00:24:47,788 --> 00:24:49,456
Probably 20.

00:24:49,523 --> 00:24:50,924
Why is that?
Why--why did you fall off

00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:52,392
so dramatically?

00:24:52,459 --> 00:24:54,928
I ended the company
in 2003,

00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:56,997
because my dirt business
took off,

00:24:57,064 --> 00:24:59,333
where I could not do both.

00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:00,868
Lyle, the walmart
and Lowe's deal you had--

00:25:00,934 --> 00:25:04,505
was that on a national basis
or just regional?

00:25:04,571 --> 00:25:06,573
That was
my local two Lowe's stores

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,008
and my local walmart.

00:25:08,075 --> 00:25:09,343
Okay.
We had to sell 'em

00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:12,212
as a special order item.
They--until I sold--

00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:13,413
did you try
to go national?

00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,816
The response I got
when we did call is,

00:25:15,883 --> 00:25:18,719
you need to sell
a certain amount of units,

00:25:18,785 --> 00:25:20,387
and once you get
to that point,

00:25:20,454 --> 00:25:21,788
They would consider 'em
to put me on the shelf.

00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:23,891
So--okay, so that's where
We're getting.

00:25:23,957 --> 00:25:25,926
Why do you feel that
the Units didn't sell?

00:25:25,993 --> 00:25:28,929
Well, special order items mean
there's a display

00:25:28,996 --> 00:25:30,898
at the store,
but you can't pick it up.

00:25:30,964 --> 00:25:32,165
That's terrible.
You have to order it
that day...

00:25:32,232 --> 00:25:33,467
Deadly. Mm-hmm.

00:25:33,534 --> 00:25:35,402
And then he has to come back
in another day or two.

00:25:35,469 --> 00:25:38,172
So great presentation, um,

00:25:38,238 --> 00:25:41,875
but if Lowe's and those guys
couldn't really sell,

00:25:41,942 --> 00:25:42,809
I don't want
to get into a space where

00:25:42,876 --> 00:25:44,711
the professionals weren't
able to do it,

00:25:44,778 --> 00:25:47,514
so I'm out.

00:25:47,581 --> 00:25:49,449
Lyle...
yes, sir?

00:25:49,516 --> 00:25:51,218
I love you.
You're the first--
I love you, too, man.

00:25:51,285 --> 00:25:52,653
(chuckles)
No, no. Let me tell you why.

00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:53,954
(mark, Barbara,
and Robert laugh)

00:25:54,021 --> 00:25:54,955
You're the first guy
I've ever met that

00:25:55,022 --> 00:25:56,156
made money selling dirt.

00:25:56,223 --> 00:25:58,058
I sell manure, sir.
(chuckles)

00:25:58,125 --> 00:26:00,761
Hey, if you can sell poo-poo
and make money,

00:26:00,827 --> 00:26:01,828
that's fantastic...
yes, sir.

00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:03,997
But it's not gonna be
a huge business,

00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:06,700
and for that reason,
I'm out.

00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:09,570
Lyle, you got busy
with your dirt business,

00:26:09,636 --> 00:26:11,905
and it kinda sat on the side,
and now you're here

00:26:11,972 --> 00:26:13,874
showing it again,
bringing it back to life.

00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:17,845
There's something used
and warmed up about it and over

00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:18,846
that makes me uncomfortable.

00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:19,880
(inhales deeply)

00:26:19,947 --> 00:26:21,949
So I'd have to say
I am out.

00:26:22,015 --> 00:26:23,951
Well, I never lost interest
in it, Barbara.

00:26:24,017 --> 00:26:25,886
But you brought it back
from the dead.
I mean, to me--

00:26:25,953 --> 00:26:27,421
it--yeah,
and--and the same unit

00:26:27,487 --> 00:26:30,224
we have--I built for my wife
10 or 11 years ago,

00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,558
we still use.

00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:33,160
All the ones that
we have sold,

00:26:33,227 --> 00:26:35,395
we haven't had one RETURN
or complaint,

00:26:35,462 --> 00:26:37,331
because there's only
one moving part.

00:26:37,397 --> 00:26:39,466
Lyle, you saw a need
from your wife,

00:26:39,533 --> 00:26:42,569
and you created a product.

00:26:42,636 --> 00:26:44,872
Not an investment right now.

00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:46,840
(chuckles) I'm out.

00:26:46,907 --> 00:26:49,009
Lyle, I gotta tell you,
your heart's in it.

00:26:49,076 --> 00:26:52,579
It's a good idea.
It fills a need,

00:26:52,646 --> 00:26:55,015
but it's just tough
to write a check to somebody

00:26:55,082 --> 00:26:57,918
who's not eating, sleeping,
and breathing the business,

00:26:57,985 --> 00:27:00,988
and so for that reason,
I'm out.

00:27:01,054 --> 00:27:02,756
Yeah.
Thank you, Lyle.

00:27:02,823 --> 00:27:03,991
Thank you.
I thank all of you folks.

00:27:04,057 --> 00:27:05,425
Have a great day.
All right.

00:27:05,492 --> 00:27:06,560
(daymond and Barbara)
Good luck.
You, too, Lyle.

00:27:06,627 --> 00:27:07,561
Good luck to you.
All right. Bye-Bye.

00:27:07,628 --> 00:27:09,229
(chuckles)

00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:10,197
What a great guy.
He is.

00:27:10,264 --> 00:27:11,965
Yeah, a very nice guy.
One fun guy.

00:27:12,032 --> 00:27:13,800
He should have let us invest
in his dirt business.
(chuckles)

00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:15,402
I didn't get a deal today,

00:27:15,469 --> 00:27:20,207
and that kinda disappoints me,
but, you know, life's too short.

00:27:20,274 --> 00:27:23,877
Get over it, and it's all right.
I'm still coming home, Honey.

Specially designed pockets.

00:28:49,307 --> 00:28:51,876
We've engineered our pockets
to fit almost any device,

00:28:51,943 --> 00:28:54,378
and these pockets are
layered into clothing

00:28:54,445 --> 00:28:57,648
so that there are no bulges
and everything is Balanced.

00:28:57,715 --> 00:29:00,852

I'm flipping through the back

00:29:46,697 --> 00:29:50,868
of "Men's journal" Magazine,
and there was a similar product,

00:29:50,935 --> 00:29:52,236

wow, what a great idea.
Yeah.

00:29:53,938 --> 00:29:56,040
it is a great idea,
and--and it is my product.

00:29:56,107 --> 00:29:58,276
I formed a retail company

00:29:58,342 --> 00:30:01,245
to prove the concept of
technology enabled clothing,

00:30:01,312 --> 00:30:03,147
and I've been running
that company

00:30:03,214 --> 00:30:05,316
for a-a number of years,

00:30:05,383 --> 00:30:08,152
waiting for the patent,
and now that it is issued,

00:30:08,219 --> 00:30:11,289
I'm here seeking an investment
in Technology enabled clothing

00:30:11,355 --> 00:30:13,024
as a licensing company

00:30:13,091 --> 00:30:16,060
to bring this system--
the intellectual property

00:30:16,127 --> 00:30:17,862
along with
the registered brand name

00:30:17,929 --> 00:30:20,898
and the product know-how--
to other clothing companies.

00:30:20,965 --> 00:30:22,233
Tell me about
the retail business,

00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,434
'cause that proves the concept.

00:30:23,501 --> 00:30:24,635
Yes, it does. It's like--

00:30:24,702 --> 00:30:26,037
what are the sales
in the retail business?

00:30:26,104 --> 00:30:29,040
Well, to date,
it's $5.1 million,

00:30:29,107 --> 00:30:33,311
and we're on track to do
$12 million this year.

00:30:34,612 --> 00:30:37,048
The retail business--
is that real--

00:30:37,115 --> 00:30:38,783
That's not part of this.

00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:41,119
(mouths word)

00:30:42,954 --> 00:30:44,155
That's not part of it?

00:30:44,222 --> 00:30:45,223
No.

00:30:45,289 --> 00:30:46,657
Is the idea now

00:30:46,724 --> 00:30:48,459
that we're not gonna sell
this retail,

00:30:48,526 --> 00:30:51,629
we're simply gonna step back,
take the intellectual property,

00:30:51,696 --> 00:30:54,699
the I.P.,
and license it to others?

00:30:54,766 --> 00:30:56,067
That--that's exactly right.

00:30:56,134 --> 00:30:58,236
I-in terms of the offer
I'm presenting here today,

00:30:58,302 --> 00:31:00,037
it's for
the intellectual property

00:31:00,104 --> 00:31:02,039
and the brand name,
the bigger idea,

00:31:02,106 --> 00:31:04,075
the billion-dollar idea.
Right.

00:31:04,142 --> 00:31:06,644
<i>The sharks have discovered</i>
<i>Scott only wants to sell</i>

00:31:08,713 --> 00:31:12,150
<i>and not in his lucrative</i>
<i>retail clothing Business.</i>

00:31:12,216 --> 00:31:15,219
Scott, you're saying
that the proprietary patent,

00:31:15,286 --> 00:31:16,788
which you say you have now...

00:31:16,854 --> 00:31:18,723
yes, I do.
Is what you're selling me,
right?

00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,525
Right.
Why aren't you bundling it
all together?

00:31:20,591 --> 00:31:23,861
Why are you being
so greedy and Savage?

00:31:23,928 --> 00:31:25,062
'cause I'm like you.

00:31:25,129 --> 00:31:26,431
(chuckles) Oh.
(laughs)

00:31:26,497 --> 00:31:28,232
What I'd like you
to understand is that

00:31:28,299 --> 00:31:30,868
what my other company
has been doing

00:31:30,935 --> 00:31:33,538
has been building the brand
of technology enabled clothing

00:31:33,604 --> 00:31:34,605
for years.

00:31:34,672 --> 00:31:38,042
What is the technology
we are buying?

00:31:38,109 --> 00:31:40,878
I see that you can put
the speakers through the Hood.

00:31:40,945 --> 00:31:42,647
Now I know Burton--
uh, n-not through the Hood,

00:31:42,713 --> 00:31:44,282
but through
the pocketing system, Yeah.
Headphones--

00:31:44,348 --> 00:31:46,017
uh, I know Burton has done
this for years,

00:31:46,084 --> 00:31:48,152
so what exactly do you have
that's different

00:31:48,219 --> 00:31:49,220
from all the other ones
that I know exist?

00:31:49,287 --> 00:31:51,522
Well, th-they infringed
on our patent.

00:31:53,224 --> 00:31:54,358
Have you ever protected it?

00:31:54,425 --> 00:31:55,693
Yes.
And you collected?

00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,028
Did you win?

00:31:57,095 --> 00:31:59,197
Yes.

00:31:59,263 --> 00:32:02,033
I've settled with 11
of the largest companies,

00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,235
including V.F. Corporation,
north face...

00:32:04,302 --> 00:32:05,236
Sure.

00:32:05,303 --> 00:32:06,871
Ralph Lauren,
Calvin Klein...

00:32:06,938 --> 00:32:08,372
okay.
Under Armour, spyder.

00:32:08,439 --> 00:32:10,241
Are you getting
an ongoing royalty?
Uh, it's subject

00:32:10,308 --> 00:32:12,043
to non--uh,
confidentiality agreements...

00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,444
but wait a second, though.
And so--

00:32:13,511 --> 00:32:15,646
is it getting a royalty stream
from the settlements?

00:32:15,713 --> 00:32:16,848
You don't have
to tell me how much.

00:32:16,914 --> 00:32:19,150
Uh, yes.
Okay, listen.

00:32:19,217 --> 00:32:20,184
And is that part
of your bottom line?
Stop right now.

00:32:20,251 --> 00:32:21,385
Stop right now.

00:32:21,452 --> 00:32:23,154
You need me very badly.
Yes.

00:32:23,221 --> 00:32:24,622
I know how to Sue people.

00:32:24,689 --> 00:32:26,390
(mark, Barbara, and Scott laugh)

00:32:26,457 --> 00:32:29,060
This is going to be wonderful.
I want it all, though.

00:32:29,127 --> 00:32:31,395
Why are you just giving me
a taste,

00:32:31,462 --> 00:32:32,730
when I want to eat
the whole pie?
But, Kevin, Kevin, hey.

00:32:32,797 --> 00:32:33,798
Let's not get--let's--
I don't need you

00:32:33,865 --> 00:32:34,799
for the other company.
Kevin. Kevin.

00:32:34,866 --> 00:32:35,800
Kevin.
Yes, you do.

00:32:35,867 --> 00:32:37,068
Oh. (chuckles)
I just don't.

00:32:37,135 --> 00:32:39,303
The problem is,
there's leakage in the deal.

00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:41,639
I don't get
any of the good stuff,

00:32:41,706 --> 00:32:43,307
just the risky stuff.
No, it--

00:32:43,374 --> 00:32:44,809
no, it's not risky.

00:32:44,876 --> 00:32:48,146
So, Scott, what exactly is
the property that you own that

00:32:48,212 --> 00:32:50,681
you can defend
and have defended?

00:32:50,748 --> 00:32:53,050
A garment
with no wires in it

00:32:53,117 --> 00:32:56,120
but the capacity
to wire things in it.

00:32:56,187 --> 00:32:57,221
Is it a design patent?

00:32:57,288 --> 00:32:58,656
Yeah,
design and utility patent.

00:32:58,723 --> 00:32:59,957
And it's been issued?

00:33:00,024 --> 00:33:02,226
Not only issued,
not only tested in litigation,

00:33:02,293 --> 00:33:06,431
but recently reexamined
and passed reexamination.

00:33:06,497 --> 00:33:09,634
So basically, the patent
is attributable to the wires?

00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,868
That's right.
Only the wires?

00:33:10,935 --> 00:33:12,603
So they--for example,
this pocket here

00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:15,239
has a hole in it
that leads up through here.

00:33:15,306 --> 00:33:16,574
That's ridiculous.
That is ridiculous.

00:33:16,641 --> 00:33:20,144
That's just common sense.
Wires in, wires out.

00:33:20,211 --> 00:33:21,112
That's what's killing
this country,

00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:22,880
that we get dumbass patents

00:33:22,947 --> 00:33:24,615
that people
then turn around and Sue,

00:33:24,682 --> 00:33:26,217
when it's just
common sense stuff.
Yes, I love this country.

00:33:26,284 --> 00:33:27,518
It's ridiculous.
But, uh--

00:33:27,585 --> 00:33:28,820
you're being un-American.
Think--think about--

00:33:28,886 --> 00:33:30,054
think about this.

00:33:30,121 --> 00:33:32,190
I understand
as a businessman

00:33:32,256 --> 00:33:35,059
exactly what you're saying,
especially as an EX-lawyer

00:33:35,126 --> 00:33:37,728
who hated dealing
with Lawyers so much

00:33:37,795 --> 00:33:41,065
I stopped practicing law.
Running a wire
through a piece of clothing?

00:33:41,132 --> 00:33:42,633
I'm telling you, mark.
I mean, I-I--

00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,735
that's a patent?
Are you kidding me?!

00:33:44,802 --> 00:33:46,104
who cares? Retail value.

00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:48,473
No, you're crazy. No, no, no,
no. You're so full of crap.

00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:50,808
(daymond) Scott, the cases
you have defended have been

00:33:50,875 --> 00:33:53,177
when--argument's sake,
let's say one of my designers--

00:33:53,244 --> 00:33:54,445
and I have 30 of 'em--

00:33:54,512 --> 00:33:57,548
decide to wire something, a Hood
or something else like that.

00:33:57,615 --> 00:33:59,050
It goes out.

00:33:59,117 --> 00:34:01,786
We don't even know you exist
and have that patent.

00:34:01,853 --> 00:34:05,156
You hit us. We say, "instead
of paying the attorney bills,

00:34:05,223 --> 00:34:06,624
"Give him $50,000 to go away

00:34:06,691 --> 00:34:08,059
'cause we don't have time
for this," and that's it.

00:34:08,126 --> 00:34:11,329
And that's the reason why you've
got to defend all of those--

00:34:11,395 --> 00:34:13,397
and that is <i>horrible, </i>
horrible, horrible, horrible.

00:34:13,464 --> 00:34:14,632
I love it!
Why do you say that?

00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:17,068
That is what this country
was formed on...

00:34:17,135 --> 00:34:18,269
you're a lawyer.
You're gonna say that.

00:34:18,336 --> 00:34:19,270
Coming up with a unique idea
and defending it.

00:34:19,337 --> 00:34:21,439
Scott, just to be really clear,

00:34:21,506 --> 00:34:24,142
you came up
with a fantastic idea.

00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:25,877
You patented that idea.

00:34:25,943 --> 00:34:28,379
You went out and built
a business on your idea

00:34:28,446 --> 00:34:29,981
that'll do
$12 million this year,

00:34:30,047 --> 00:34:32,049
$24 million next year...

00:34:32,116 --> 00:34:33,684
if not more.

00:34:33,751 --> 00:34:36,020
And now you don't want
to sell us any of that business.

00:34:36,087 --> 00:34:39,791
You just wanna take the idea
and sell us the patent of it.

00:34:39,857 --> 00:34:41,192
Yes, I do.

00:34:41,259 --> 00:34:44,061
My other business only has
a very insignificant part

00:34:44,128 --> 00:34:46,364
of a much larger market.
No, because
your other business

00:34:46,431 --> 00:34:48,299
could end up being
the billion-dollar business

00:34:48,366 --> 00:34:49,600
that we have nothing in.

00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:52,370
Did you start it
just to cap off at $12 million?

00:34:52,437 --> 00:34:56,441
You're gonna grow
that business.

00:34:56,507 --> 00:34:57,642
Um...
and you're gonna have

00:34:57,708 --> 00:34:58,810
the first right
to this technology

00:34:58,876 --> 00:35:00,178
and not have to pay us.

00:35:00,244 --> 00:35:02,046
That's all negotiable. Okay?

00:35:02,113 --> 00:35:03,815
I mean...

00:35:03,881 --> 00:35:05,650
so...

00:35:05,716 --> 00:35:07,985
I'm here to negotiate.

00:35:08,052 --> 00:35:12,156
Would you sell me 15%
of <i>that </i>business

00:35:12,223 --> 00:35:14,725
for $500,000?

00:35:16,094 --> 00:35:17,628
You've gotta be kidding me.

00:35:17,695 --> 00:35:19,130
(laughs)
Wait. Wait.

00:35:19,197 --> 00:35:20,098
Yeah, but that is--

how much money are you gonna
make on that $12 million?

00:36:04,909 --> 00:36:07,545
$2.1 million.
You just called him insane

00:36:07,612 --> 00:36:10,281
for offering you
a half a million dollars.

00:36:10,348 --> 00:36:11,916
For a company that's making
$2 million? Yes.

00:36:11,983 --> 00:36:13,818
So then why are you here?

00:36:13,885 --> 00:36:16,921
Honestly,
I want your connections.

00:36:16,988 --> 00:36:17,855
I want your expertise,
I want your help,

00:36:17,922 --> 00:36:19,424
and I want your money.
(Kevin) Look...

00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:20,992
may I just stop you there?

00:36:21,058 --> 00:36:24,328
I have to ask you something.
Do you have a business partner?

00:36:24,395 --> 00:36:25,863
Yes.

00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:27,231
They must be a saint...
(laughs)

00:36:27,298 --> 00:36:31,569
Because you strike me like
you'd be one pain in the neck--

00:36:31,636 --> 00:36:32,770
he's a lawyer.
What do you expect?

00:36:32,837 --> 00:36:34,005
Yeah, but beyond that.
You're tough.

00:36:34,071 --> 00:36:35,206
You know who the partner is?

00:36:35,273 --> 00:36:36,874
(Robert) who?
My wife.

00:36:36,941 --> 00:36:38,042
Oh, god.
Is she a lawyer, too?

00:36:38,109 --> 00:36:39,844
Yes.
(laughs)

00:36:39,911 --> 00:36:41,679
(Barbara) and you know what?
Shocking!

00:36:41,746 --> 00:36:44,182
Scott, Scott, just to be clear,
I'm out.

00:36:44,248 --> 00:36:46,751
I understand.

00:36:46,818 --> 00:36:49,687
Scott, okay, so we're talking
about $1.2 million free cash?

00:36:49,754 --> 00:36:51,022
Yeah.

00:36:51,089 --> 00:36:53,091
What's a clothing company
trading at these days?

00:36:53,157 --> 00:36:54,826
Let's call it five times?
No.

00:36:54,892 --> 00:36:58,162
Why?
Inter--internet Clo--'cause
we're direct to consumer.

00:36:58,229 --> 00:37:00,031
We're internet
clothing company.

00:37:00,098 --> 00:37:01,999
What's it worth?
$30 Million.

00:37:02,066 --> 00:37:04,535
$30 million?
$30 Million on--

00:37:04,602 --> 00:37:07,038
who's insane now?
'cause it's growing
at 100% a year.

00:37:07,105 --> 00:37:09,440
It has intellectual property.
That's where it's unique.

00:37:09,507 --> 00:37:11,109
It's online.
It's building a brand.

00:37:11,175 --> 00:37:13,244
A lifestyle brand.

00:37:13,311 --> 00:37:15,847
It--it's not--first of all,
the intellectual property

00:37:15,913 --> 00:37:18,983
is built about running a wire
the clothing.

00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:21,652
A rivet, a wire, velcro.

00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:23,020
It doesn't matter
what it is.

00:37:23,087 --> 00:37:26,457
It <i>does </i>matter because
wireless is what's next.

00:37:26,524 --> 00:37:28,926
Wires will not go away
with battery power,

00:37:28,993 --> 00:37:31,095
and--and for the time being,
for music.

00:37:31,162 --> 00:37:32,363
People will always prefer

00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:34,599
to listen to music
with wire Headsets.

00:37:34,665 --> 00:37:35,933
Sound Quality's better.

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,535
You don't have to worry
about pairing issues.

00:37:37,602 --> 00:37:38,903
I-I don't agree.

00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:40,772
I'll put low power bluetooth
into the shoulder.

00:37:40,838 --> 00:37:42,874
Let it distribute
to all the other devices

00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,675
and to the headphones.

00:37:44,742 --> 00:37:47,145
I'd kick your ass.
So I'm out.

00:37:49,514 --> 00:37:51,115
You were out
from the moment you sat down,

00:37:51,182 --> 00:37:54,152
so I--you know,
you're no loss.

00:37:54,218 --> 00:37:55,486
What is your problem?

00:37:55,553 --> 00:37:57,255
Why would you say a comment
like that to mark?

00:37:57,321 --> 00:37:59,424
You called me insane.

00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:01,926
No, I--your valuations
were insane.

00:38:01,993 --> 00:38:05,196
I think it's an insult
that you wouldn't offer us

00:38:05,263 --> 00:38:06,497
part of the bigger picture.

00:38:06,564 --> 00:38:08,966
I'm out.

00:38:11,335 --> 00:38:13,237
<i>Three sharks are out,</i>

00:38:13,304 --> 00:38:17,008
<i>and Scott has one offer</i>
<i>on the table from Robert.</i>

00:38:17,074 --> 00:38:19,444
(Kevin) You know,
they asked a scorpion

00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:23,047
why it would kill something
that's floating across the pond.

00:38:23,114 --> 00:38:25,550
'cause it's its nature.

00:38:25,616 --> 00:38:28,019
You're a lawyer. It's
your nature to be like this.

00:38:28,086 --> 00:38:29,187
I'm okay with it.

00:38:30,855 --> 00:38:32,423
Mark brings up a great point
about wireless.

00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:33,691
You gotta admit that.

00:38:33,758 --> 00:38:35,426
It hasn't happened today.

00:38:35,493 --> 00:38:37,328
It's coming,
and technology changes,

00:38:37,395 --> 00:38:40,198
and there will be very low-cost
wireless headphones.

00:38:40,264 --> 00:38:42,400
It'll erode your share.
In the meantime,

00:38:42,467 --> 00:38:44,402
you're doing a great job
building this business.

00:38:44,469 --> 00:38:45,903
Now Robert made you an offer.

00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:48,072
He said, bundle them together
and he'll give you 500k for 15%.

00:38:48,139 --> 00:38:51,876
I'll go in with him
on that deal and go 50/50,

00:38:51,943 --> 00:38:54,412
<i>or </i>I'll offer you
a million bucks.

00:38:54,479 --> 00:38:57,782
If he wants to come in with me,
we'll double it

00:38:57,849 --> 00:38:59,117
for 30%.

00:39:02,754 --> 00:39:05,690
I gave you $500,000 for 15%.

00:39:05,757 --> 00:39:07,792
I don't need O'Leary on that.

00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:10,595
Would you consider that?
Fine, then I'll make the--
I'll make the same offer.

00:39:10,661 --> 00:39:11,829
You can choose between us.

00:39:11,896 --> 00:39:13,698
I'll make you the same offer
'cause I think

00:39:13,765 --> 00:39:15,733
combining them together
in the clothing industry,

00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,069
with the risk of wireless
taking some share away

00:39:18,136 --> 00:39:19,737
in the next 36 months--

00:39:19,804 --> 00:39:21,539
500k for 15%.

00:39:21,606 --> 00:39:25,910
Scott, is--is there a premise
under which

00:39:25,977 --> 00:39:30,148
you're gonna entertain and offer
in the real business?

00:39:30,214 --> 00:39:33,317
Well, I-I have a call
that I need to make.

00:39:33,384 --> 00:39:35,820
You know who was
on my advisory board?

00:39:35,887 --> 00:39:37,822
Steve Wozniak,
the cofounder of apple.

00:39:37,889 --> 00:39:41,459
I-I need to talk
with Steve Wozniak.

00:39:41,526 --> 00:39:42,660
Tell woz I said "Hi," too.
I will.

00:39:42,727 --> 00:39:43,928
Would you like to say hi,
Kevin?

00:39:43,995 --> 00:39:45,930
Sure. I sold him
a ton of software.

00:39:45,997 --> 00:39:47,932
I <i>was </i>their education business
for years.

00:39:51,936 --> 00:39:54,338
You shouldn't be able
to take nonsense like that

00:39:54,405 --> 00:39:55,773
and turn it into a patent,

00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,675
and then fill up
the legal system,

00:39:57,742 --> 00:39:59,744
and then create unlimited
uncertainty for companies.

00:39:59,811 --> 00:40:01,979
It's wrong.
It's absolutely wrong.

00:40:02,046 --> 00:40:03,247
I agree with you, mark.

00:40:04,916 --> 00:40:06,684
I love him.

00:40:06,751 --> 00:40:09,253
Steve, thanks.
Oh, my God. It's very good
to hear from you.

00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,956
Here--here's the deal.
I got two offers on the table.

00:40:12,023 --> 00:40:16,594
Uh, both from, uh, Kevin
and, un, Robert.

00:40:16,661 --> 00:40:20,865
They're the same amount--
$500,000 for 15%,

00:40:20,932 --> 00:40:22,867
which is what I asked for,

00:40:22,934 --> 00:40:27,271
but they're insisting that I
include my other retail company.

00:40:27,338 --> 00:40:30,741
I'm--I'm sorry. That's just
too much for this kind of offer.

00:40:30,808 --> 00:40:32,543
I-I mean, I don't think
this Offer's good enough

00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:35,179
for, you know, giving up,
you know, um,

00:40:35,246 --> 00:40:37,148
you know,
what you've got going already.

00:40:37,215 --> 00:40:39,917
What he's doing right now is,
he's trying to figure out,

00:40:39,984 --> 00:40:43,087
is he serious about selling
the REAL business or not?

00:40:43,154 --> 00:40:46,491
If I believe he will, maybe I'll
make him a real offer.

00:40:46,557 --> 00:40:47,692
All right, come on back.
Ready or...

00:40:47,759 --> 00:40:48,860
I-I don't wanna...

00:40:48,926 --> 00:40:49,994
we were just talking bad
about you, but it's okay.

00:40:50,061 --> 00:40:51,429
(laughs)
You can interrupt.

00:40:51,496 --> 00:40:54,432
Um, you know, Steve says hi.

00:40:54,499 --> 00:40:56,400
(grunts)
He doesn't know you. Sorry.

00:40:56,467 --> 00:40:58,069
(daymond and Barbara) Ohh!
(laughs)

00:40:58,136 --> 00:41:00,204
No, I'm kidding. I...

00:41:00,271 --> 00:41:04,342
first, before I relay
Steve's comments, um,

00:41:04,408 --> 00:41:07,345
would anyone else like
to, you know, reconsider?

00:41:07,411 --> 00:41:09,547
Why don't you tell us
what woz said?

00:41:09,614 --> 00:41:12,116
Woz, you know,
just thought that it was

00:41:12,183 --> 00:41:15,853
an AWFULLY low offer for such
a well-established business.

00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,991
Did woz agree, though,
that the only logical Play

00:41:20,057 --> 00:41:23,361
was that it's one business,
not two businesses?

00:41:23,428 --> 00:41:26,364
Um, you--we didn't talk
about that specifically,

00:41:26,431 --> 00:41:28,933
although woz knew
what I was pitching

00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,268
because I've discussed this
with him.

00:41:30,334 --> 00:41:33,771
Your answer to $500,000 for 15%,
I'm taking it, is no.

00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:37,008
Um, I-I wanted you give you
another opportunity

00:41:37,074 --> 00:41:39,410
and, uh, you know...
to bid against himself?

00:41:39,477 --> 00:41:41,345
Well, I mean, to--to rethink.
Why don't you counter?

00:41:41,412 --> 00:41:43,347
I mean, to rethink the logic
of one m--

00:41:43,414 --> 00:41:45,850
you know, Scott, the way
it works in the tank is,

00:41:45,917 --> 00:41:47,919
we make an offer, you counter.
All right,
then let me be clear.

00:41:47,985 --> 00:41:49,520
Kevin, you're out.

00:41:49,587 --> 00:41:52,423
You're out.
I don't--I don't need you.

00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:53,624
Wow.

00:41:53,691 --> 00:41:55,259
You had $1 MILLION
sitting here.

00:41:55,326 --> 00:41:57,929
Will your wife represent me in
suing you for wasting my time?

00:41:57,995 --> 00:41:59,897
(laughs)
Because that's all you're doing
right now.

00:41:59,964 --> 00:42:01,699
You didn't come to make a deal.

00:42:01,766 --> 00:42:03,067
I didn't waste your time.
Don't waste ours.
(speaks indistinctly)

00:42:03,134 --> 00:42:05,703
Hey, Scott. You know what?
Seriously, what the hell?

00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:07,505
You point at me
and you tell me I'm out?

00:42:07,572 --> 00:42:10,775
Uh... Bye-Bye.

00:42:10,842 --> 00:42:14,178
(Robert) Show a little more
respect.

00:42:14,245 --> 00:42:16,047
Ugh! That was exhausting.

00:42:16,114 --> 00:42:17,482
That was painful.

00:42:17,548 --> 00:42:20,518
As my mother always said,
the fish stinks from the head.

00:42:20,585 --> 00:42:21,953
Why are we still
talking about it?

00:42:22,019 --> 00:42:24,655
I went in looking for a deal.
I truly did.

00:42:24,722 --> 00:42:25,823
But unfortunately,

00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:29,293
the valuation that they put
on my other company...

00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,363
combined Was just insulting.

00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:34,932
I had no other choice.
I had to walk.
