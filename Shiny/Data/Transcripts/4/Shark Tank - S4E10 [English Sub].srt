00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:02,830
(man) The sharks are back

00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:04,430
in an all-New season
of "Shark tank,"

00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:07,500
where Hopeful entrepreneurs
from across the country

00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,830
dream of a chance
to secure an investment

00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,430
and gain powerful partners...

00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,530
to start, grow,
or save their businesses.

00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:16,600
You are a nasty beast.

00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,800
I'm not a nasty beast.

00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,530
I like that.

00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,230
If the sharks
hear a great idea,

00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,600
they're ready to invest
using their own money...

00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,500
there's $50,000
on the table.

00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,370
Can you convince
another shark to play?

00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,170
And they'll fight each other
for a piece of the action.

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,670
But first, the entrepreneurs
must convince a shark

00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,200
to invest the full amount
they're asking for,

00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,370
or they'll walk away
with nothing.

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,600
The energy shots that are
out right now suck.

00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,800
(imitates French accent)
a delicious looking morsel, no?

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,130
(both laugh)

00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,230
(laughs)
When you first came out,

00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,230
I thought you were
two bozos in a boat,

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,230
but you're not so dumb.

00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,400
It's sink...

00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,530
(laughs) Do you know
how crazy that sounds?

00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,470
Or swim.
I like it a lot.

00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,470
I'll give you
what you want.

00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,300
What?

00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,070
Who are the sharks?

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,000
They're self-Made millionaire
and billionaire investors

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,270
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.

00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,400
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist

00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,570
who turned a $10,000 loan
into a software business

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,070
worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,070
Barbara Corcoran
went from working

00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,630

00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:24,270
to building the city's
preeminent real estate empire.

into the globally recognized
fashion brand FUBU.

internet companies

for over $350 million.

00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:03,830
♪♪♪

00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,330
My name is Jackie Courtney,

00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,930
and I live
in Brooklyn, New York.

00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,200
When I got married
a year ago,

00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,200
I had a hard time finding
a dress that I loved

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,700
and that I could afford.

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,500
I, like most brides,
want that dream dress

00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,000
that I've seen in magazines.

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,470
Those dresses, however,

00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,400
cost upwards of $10,000,

00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,300
which is a price,
in today's economy,

00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,100
that most girls can't afford.

00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,400
My business, nearly newlywed,

00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,470
is an online boutique
for modern brides

00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:31,330
to buy and sell high-End,
nearly new wedding dresses.

00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,730
And let me know if you
have any other questions.

00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,070
I'm totally available.

00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,570
This business means a lot to me.

00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,530
Right now, I'm working
out of my 1-Bedroom apartment

00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,930
and there's wedding
dresses everywhere.

00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,200
I need an investment
from the sharks

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,100
so I can take a great idea
and turn it into

00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,070
the big business that
I know it can be.

00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,870
It's just the beginning.

00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,730
Hi. My name's Jackie,

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:03,370
and the name of my company
is nearly newlywed.

00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,900
I'm here today asking
for a $35,000 investment

00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,600
in exchange for 10% ownership
in my company.

00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,830
Nearly newlywed
is an online boutique

00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,930
that's offering
a new way for girls

00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,830
to shop
for their wedding dresses.

00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,130
When I was growing up
in iowa,

00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,500
I couldn't get enough
of the glitz and glamour

00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,330
I saw in magazines,

00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,600
so I moved to New York city
to be a part of it all.

00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,870
I went to work
as a fashion publicist,

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,170
getting to dress
celebrities and editors,

00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:33,000
and what really surprised me
was that they all borrowed

00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
everything
they wore on the red carpet.

00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,800
Unfortunately,
I'm not a celebrity,

00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,000
which I quickly realized
when planning my wedding.

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,300
The dresses I loved
were so expensive.

00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,300
So I created
nearly newlywed.

00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,000
Let me take you
on a quick tour.

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,470
If you visit our site,

00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,870
you can see some of the newest
dresses we've gotten in,

00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,070
like this marchesa.

00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:55,670
This marchesa gown retails
for $11,000 in stores,

00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,870
But at nearly newlywed,

00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,000
you can have it
for just $3,800.

00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,530
What's even better
is our sell-it-back guarantee.

00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,530
After your wedding,
you can sell it back to us

00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,470
for 50% of what you paid,

00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,530
making this $11,000 dress

00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,970
available to girls
for only $1,900.

00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,170
The inspiration for what I'm
doing was really my own wedding.

00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,170
I was married last June
to my husband Patrick.

00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,730
That same dress
has been worn

00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,300
by multiple brides,

00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,470
as you can see in just
a sampling of their photos here.

00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,470
And here it is,

00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,130
looking gorgeous
on Kate today.

00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,130
We just launched,

00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,230
but our growth
has been incredible.

00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,370
So I would love
to partner with one of you

00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,770
to meet the demand.

00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,370
Jackie, I thought that women
loved to keep their dress.

00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,770
I think that the mentality,

00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:42,670
what a woman wants on her
wedding day, has really changed.

00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,700
I mean, arguably,
it is a very personal,

00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,630
sentimental purchase.
Well, Jackie,
let's ask Barbara.

00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,830
She's been married
eight times.
(laughs)

00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,830
You know,
I've been married twice,

00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,170
and I almost didn't keep
my first wedding dress,

00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,130
but I wore it again
when I found my second husband.

00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,470
You did?
Yes.

00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,800
So there you go.
You're a perfect example

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,370
of wearing it again.
But let me ask you--

00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,130
to me, what's the difference
between this and renting a gown?

00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,470
There's nothing
that's long-term,

00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,670
flexible, and has
the selection that we have.

00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,100
This is essentially

00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,070
the convenience of renting
with options.

00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,970
You can alter it.
It's yours, in your closet.

00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,800
Can you alter a rental gown?
Uh, no.

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,370
Oh, well,
that's an important difference.

00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,570
It's like a used car.

00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,630
She buys it, she sells it,
she buys it, she sells it.

00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,170
I mean, they can't,
you know, Dye the dress purple.

00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,970
How many do you have
in inventory now?

00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,230
We started with just 30,

00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,700
and we just tripled
our inventory

00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,200
in the last--last week.
Tripled?

00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,970
So you're laying out capital?
You buy these?

00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,500
We're not laying out
any capital.

00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,400
How--Oh, do tell.
We have almost
$300,000 worth of inventory

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,570
of--That's the resale price,
not the retail price.

00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:40,100
When you buy
that $11,000 dress,

00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,970
what are you paying
for it?
Nothing.

00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,930
So you're getting them
on consignment from who?

00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,900
We're getting them
on consignment from brides...
Ah.

00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,530
Stylists, and we are--
Actually,

00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,170
we've already
been approached

00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,970
by designers and boutiques
to collaborate.
So you do not pay

00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,600
for the inventory
until you have sold it?

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,070
That's correct.
(Barbara) That's a huge profit.

00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,630
So you're ebay--You're ebay
for wedding dresses.

00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,370
(Barbara) And no cash flow--
Interesting, Jackie.
Interesting.

00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,230
You are a nasty beast,
Jackie.
So you actually hold--

00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,970
I'm not a nasty beast.
I like that.

00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,970
I'm trying to help girls.
I really am.

00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,570
Like, it's really
what I wanna do.
I want to ask
this question. All right.

00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:07,700
So run me through
the economics--

00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,600
So a girl sells you
her dress at $2,000.

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,230
What do you sell
the dress at?

00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,270
We like to price a gown,
unless it's very current,

00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,830
and really in demand--
So you have
a standard margin?

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,100
Yes. It's 30% to 40%.

00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,230
If a woman is looking
at an $11,000 dress

00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,970
and she can't afford it,

00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,730
why doesn't she buy
an $800 dress?

00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:24,970
I don't think
that's our girl.

00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,470
I think it's a girl
that can afford a $5,000

00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,800
and buys a $10,000.

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,400
My daughters are now
planning their wedding dress,

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,770
and they're 14.
Mm-hmm. Right.

00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,900
(laughs)
I hope it's a long way away.

00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,100
Right.
But it's such--

00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,330
Just hope there's
no shotguns involved.

00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,830
Well, no, but, you know,

00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,570
it's such a personal thing
for them.
No, it is,

00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,870
but if they came to you
and said...
I'm thinking the only time

00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,600
a woman is gonna get
a used dress

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,070
is if she's divorced.

00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,970
I completely disagree.

00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,270
(laughs)
If your daughter
came to you

00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,670
and said,
"I want a $20,000 dress,"

00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,830
and I said, "I have
that dress for her for $7,000."

00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,600
Do you think that she
wouldn't give it a chance,

00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,330
try it on?
No, I'd say,
"call uncle mark,

00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,700
and he'll pay it for you."
Yeah.

00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,530
All they--All that
matters is,

00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,300
does it look good
when they're wearing it,

00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,230
and does it look good
in the pictures, right?
What are your sales, Jackie?

00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,430
Well, we just launched,

00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,530
so, I mean, our sales data
is pretty small,

00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:08,600
because--
But what are they?

00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,900
What are they?
Walk us through a dress.

00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,530
We've sold 4
of our first 30 dresses

00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:12,530
in the last 30 days.

00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,800
Four dresses?
That's nothing.

00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,330
Right, but we just started.

00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,430
Looking forward,

00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,470
how are you gonna get
from now to success?

00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,070
Number one
is building our inventory.

00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,900
And I think another big Piece

00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,070
is continuing
the press run we're on.

00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,300
I mean, we've had--
We've just been featured

00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,830
by "the Washington post,"

00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,770
and "Ink" magazine
and "Mashable" Wrote about us

00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:29,830
because they think
that we're doing

00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,500
interesting things
in the tech space.

00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,500
You built that traffic

00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,130
because of this initial rush
in P.R.?

00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,200
Mm-Hmm.

00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,570
That's very difficult
to sustain.

00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:40,200
How are you going to maintain
that type of traffic?

00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,870
Girls are sharing this
themselves. It's not just p.R.

00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,800
So facebook is actually
one of the ways

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,870
that is driving
the majority of our traffic.

00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,270
And we have a lot of things
in the works.

00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,930
We're going to be
in "Martha Stewart,"

00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,970
recommended things
for the fall issue.
Are you paying for that?

00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,400
No, we're not.
It's editorial.

00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,970
And I'm also going to be
featured in "Marie Claire,"

00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,000
in Their, um,
under-35 entrepreneurs.

00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,730
We're, um, in talks
to partner with kleinfeld's,

00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,300
which is one of
the first boutiques

00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,530
we've been talking with,
um, because we identified them

00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:06,470
as, obviously,
the gold standard.
And what would your deal
with them potentially be?

00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,370
So we're talking
about a few different things.

00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,830
Um, you know,
they've seen a surge

00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,300
in women wanting
to sell their gowns.

00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,600
So recommending
their brides come to us,

00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,970
we're sort of their
preferred person

00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,630
for them to consign dresses.

00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,730
You know, you have a perfect
background for this business,

00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,570
coming from the P.R. Field.

00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,530
Yeah, it's definitely been
something that's really helped.

00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,070
And you're articulate
and you hustle.
Thank you.

00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,200
All great.
But you know what?

00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,330
You've been in business
three months,

00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,270
and you haven't proven
your model.
It's an idea.
It's not a business.

00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,770
No. It's a baby business.

00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:34,030
Certainly.
She's up and running.
Four dresses sold?

00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,070
(daymond)
Call four dresses a business?
You're up and running.
You've birthed it, okay?

00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,400
Yes.
Good for you.
Not easily done.

00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,170
But it is
only three months,

00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,300
and it's such a wild card.

00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,700
You haven't proven
your model,

00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,730
so I'd be afraid
I wouldn't get my money out.

00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,570
You would get
your money out.
For that--

00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,130
How would I get
my money out?

00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,700
If you invested, I would hustle
until you got every penny back,

00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,130
and more.
But it's three months,

00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,330
it's not tested.
Too early for me.

00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:58,900
And for that reason,
I'm out.

00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,800
Jackie, look, I've been
married for 23 years.

00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,430
I've been married
to the same woman.

00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,400
We bought the dress
that we could afford,

00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,300
and it's really meaningful
to her, to me...

00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm gonna cry, Robert.
And for our kids,

00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,830
so I-I just don't
buy into the concept.

00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,530
Right. I-I mean,
I understand.

00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:15,770
That's not
the entire market.
I just think
that's not...

00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:16,900
that's not everybody.
No, I hear you,

00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,400
but I don't believe
in this concept.

00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,400
I'm out.

00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,270
Jackie, isn't it True

00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,400
that one of the reasons you want
to keep the wedding dress

00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,800
is to see if your wife
fits in it 20 years later?

00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,800
(sharks laugh)

00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,170
And in your case, Kevin,
what's the answer?

00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,530
Thank goodness.

00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,030
(laughs)

00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,330
I love this space,

00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,500
and I recently got
educated in this space.

00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,270
And what I recently
got educated on is,

00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:47,030
this is the only time
that a female has no rationale,

00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,570
when it comes to purchasing
on her wedding day.

00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:53,330
And--and that's why
I find the space attractive,

00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:56,170
because the margins
are 7,000%.

00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,730
You're starting
to sound like Kevin, daymond.

00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,100
I want to be
in this space

00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,600
for the luxury
and the opulence

00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,930
and the ability to sell
something that's $4

00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,400
for $4,000.

00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,930
This does not fit my model.

00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,430

00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,800

this is such a crapshoot.

00:14:24,504 --> 00:14:26,264
Upon arrival,
you are greeted

00:14:26,264 --> 00:14:28,004
by a coast guard-Approved
captain.

00:14:28,004 --> 00:14:30,164
You then proceed
to board the "sunflower,"

00:14:30,164 --> 00:14:33,834
our luxurious
30-Foot wine vessel.

00:14:33,834 --> 00:14:36,234
Now once Everyone
is safe and secure,

00:14:36,234 --> 00:14:38,764
your vessel is ready
for departure.

00:14:38,764 --> 00:14:41,304
(clangs)

00:14:41,304 --> 00:14:43,864
on board, your senses
will come alive...

00:14:43,864 --> 00:14:47,304
(laughs)
As you experience the majesty
of the open waterways

00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:49,904
and indulge
in our premium wine tasting.

00:14:49,904 --> 00:14:52,064
Welcome aboard.
Thank you.

00:14:52,064 --> 00:14:53,934
Your wine host
serves and explains

00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,364
each of the four
wines and appetizers

00:14:56,364 --> 00:14:58,664
that are presented to you
during your ride.

00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,434
How nice is this?
Good timing.

00:15:00,434 --> 00:15:02,304
Oh, welcome aboard.
Thank you.

00:15:02,304 --> 00:15:04,234
Now this allows you
to relax... (sighs)

00:15:04,234 --> 00:15:06,664
And enjoy your time
out on the water.

00:15:06,664 --> 00:15:08,434
Nathan, is this
a singles Cruise?

00:15:08,434 --> 00:15:09,434
Should I be hitting on Barbara?

00:15:09,434 --> 00:15:11,334
(sharks laugh)

00:15:11,334 --> 00:15:12,834
Thank you.
Mmm.

00:15:12,834 --> 00:15:16,034
One of our specialty appetizers
is the renowned pesto torte.

00:15:16,034 --> 00:15:18,704
(imitates French accent)
a delicious looking morsel, no?

00:15:18,704 --> 00:15:20,164
(both laugh)

00:15:20,164 --> 00:15:21,264
(Barbara) Ha!

00:15:21,264 --> 00:15:22,804
We've served
thousands of guests,

00:15:22,804 --> 00:15:24,064
and many return every year

00:15:24,064 --> 00:15:25,864
for the intangible experience
that we call...

00:15:25,864 --> 00:15:26,864
Wait for it.

00:15:26,864 --> 00:15:30,464
(drumroll plays)

00:15:30,464 --> 00:15:32,234
Wine on the water.

00:15:32,234 --> 00:15:34,634
L-O-L-O-L.
L-O-L-O-L.
(laughs)

00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:37,434
We do offer a variety
of different types of cruises.

00:15:37,434 --> 00:15:39,564
Uh, you can choose from
beers and cheers cruises,

00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:42,464
mimosa cruises,
couples cruises,

00:15:42,464 --> 00:15:44,434
sunset cruises--
Whatever the occasion,

00:15:44,434 --> 00:15:47,064
we have an atmosphere
specifically tailored

00:15:47,064 --> 00:15:48,434
and waiting for you.

00:15:48,434 --> 00:15:50,104
So who wants
to come aboard,

00:15:50,104 --> 00:15:53,064
and help take
corks away's wine on the water

00:15:53,064 --> 00:15:55,504
to the world?

00:15:55,504 --> 00:15:57,204
So basically, guys,

00:15:57,204 --> 00:15:59,304
it's a booze Cruise
with bad theater?

00:15:59,304 --> 00:16:00,434
Well...
(laughs)

00:16:00,434 --> 00:16:01,764
It's not a booze Cruise,

00:16:01,764 --> 00:16:03,334
it is an experience
for an hour and a half

00:16:03,334 --> 00:16:04,504
with only six guests.

00:16:04,504 --> 00:16:07,004
And is Nathan
a certified captain?

00:16:07,004 --> 00:16:08,004
I am, sir.

00:16:08,004 --> 00:16:09,834
Are you seasonal
or All year round?

00:16:09,834 --> 00:16:11,564
12 Cruises per week,
all year round.

00:16:11,564 --> 00:16:13,534
So why are you here today?
Do you want more boats?

00:16:13,534 --> 00:16:17,304
We want to expand. We're
actually stage two of four.

00:16:17,304 --> 00:16:19,504
Stage one
was proof of concept.

00:16:19,504 --> 00:16:23,064
Uh, we currently have sales
of $250,000 from last year.

00:16:23,064 --> 00:16:24,404
(mark and Kevin) Whoa.
(Barbara) Wow!

00:16:24,404 --> 00:16:25,504
When you first came out,

00:16:25,504 --> 00:16:26,504
I thought you were
two bozos in a boat,

00:16:26,504 --> 00:16:27,934
but you're not so dumb.

00:16:27,934 --> 00:16:29,734
You've got almost a quarter of
a million in sales on one boat.

00:16:29,734 --> 00:16:30,904
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

00:16:30,904 --> 00:16:32,564
That's not bad.
So go on with your stages.

00:16:32,564 --> 00:16:36,004
Uh, stage two is expansion,
and we've found that we--we can

00:16:36,004 --> 00:16:37,534
expand this business
into a franchise

00:16:37,534 --> 00:16:40,134
for captains who need
a way to make money.

00:16:40,134 --> 00:16:42,304
Are you gonna go
to charter captains and say,

00:16:42,304 --> 00:16:44,234
"look, you give us your boat,

00:16:44,234 --> 00:16:46,104
"you be the captain.

00:16:46,104 --> 00:16:48,134
"I have another way
for you to make revenue

00:16:48,134 --> 00:16:49,804
when your boat
is not making money."

00:16:49,804 --> 00:16:51,164
You're absolutely on it.

00:16:51,164 --> 00:16:53,104
To expand their business?
This is an opportunity

00:16:53,104 --> 00:16:54,764
for any captain who's wanted

00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,834
to be able
to own their own business.

00:16:56,834 --> 00:16:59,464
He either got a boat,
or he's got his captain license

00:16:59,464 --> 00:17:00,864
and wants a boat
and doesn't have one yet.

00:17:00,864 --> 00:17:03,334
For $175,000,
we will give you a boat.

00:17:03,334 --> 00:17:05,104
We also give you the business
plan to work the boat,

00:17:05,104 --> 00:17:07,534
meaning that we have
all of the tools necessary.

00:17:07,534 --> 00:17:09,164
So that's
your franchise model?

00:17:09,164 --> 00:17:10,834
That's our franchise model.
That's correct.
Interesting.

00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:12,404
We make money through--
You sell the guy the boat
for $175,000.

00:17:12,404 --> 00:17:14,164
What do you pay for it?

00:17:14,164 --> 00:17:15,534
The boat only costs us $35,000.

00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,164
And you're gonna sell it
to the Skipper for $175,000?

00:17:18,164 --> 00:17:19,564
With our business plan, yes.

00:17:19,564 --> 00:17:21,734
(high-Pitched voice) What?!
whoa!

00:17:21,734 --> 00:17:23,434
(Robert) Come on!
There's no way you're--
Do you really think
you can do that?

00:17:23,434 --> 00:17:24,904
Do you really think the guy
who's buying the boat

00:17:24,904 --> 00:17:26,804
wouldn't know that the original
boat Only costs $35,000?

00:17:26,804 --> 00:17:29,064
What we're selling is the--
and while we're contemplating
those margins,

00:17:29,064 --> 00:17:30,964
get me some more wine.
(laughs) Yeah, no kidding!

00:17:30,964 --> 00:17:33,204
Yes, sir!
I can do that right now!

00:17:33,204 --> 00:17:35,564
(mark) I'm down for that.
A big part of owning
your own business

00:17:35,564 --> 00:17:37,204
is customer service
and problem solving.

00:17:37,204 --> 00:17:39,334
You understand that
you need to, uh--

00:17:39,334 --> 00:17:41,164
I'm gonna understand it better
with one more glass, though.

00:17:41,164 --> 00:17:43,464
(laughter)
Well, let's--Let's get you
drinking, mark.

00:17:43,464 --> 00:17:45,034
That's what we can do here.

00:17:45,034 --> 00:17:46,334
Stage three?

00:17:46,334 --> 00:17:48,564
Stage Three is actually
to go to our pesto torte,

00:17:48,564 --> 00:17:50,834
which you're trying there.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:52,334
And stage four--
Pesto torte phase?

00:17:52,334 --> 00:17:53,664
(mark laughs)
What is that?

00:17:53,664 --> 00:17:56,164
The pesto torte is what
we think--a great appetizer,

00:17:56,164 --> 00:17:58,134
and we would love to be able
to market that to stores.

00:17:58,134 --> 00:18:00,134
(Kevin and daymond laugh)

00:18:00,134 --> 00:18:01,434
You're gonna be selling
this little dish I just enjoyed

00:18:01,434 --> 00:18:04,364
to stores as a piece
of your business plan?

00:18:04,364 --> 00:18:05,864
They're not.
They're absolutely not,

00:18:05,864 --> 00:18:07,634
but what I figured was you guys
might want a piece of that.

00:18:07,634 --> 00:18:10,804
Our focus, you know, is--
(laughs) It's like a bonus
you throw in.

00:18:10,804 --> 00:18:12,504
I just wanna really make sure
that I heard what you said.

00:18:12,504 --> 00:18:15,164
You put three crackers here
and whatever This is on this,

00:18:15,164 --> 00:18:19,034
and you're gonna also create
an ancillatory business

00:18:19,034 --> 00:18:21,104
selling this to stores?

00:18:21,104 --> 00:18:22,834
(laughs) the pesto.

00:18:22,834 --> 00:18:24,504
If you guys see that
as a feasibility, then yes.

00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:27,104
If not,
then that's not our focus.

00:18:27,104 --> 00:18:29,464
And stage four,
if you wanna know,

00:18:29,464 --> 00:18:33,464
is to make an indoor dinner ride
in las vegas.

00:18:33,464 --> 00:18:35,604
(men) WHOA!
(Barbara) Wow!

00:18:35,604 --> 00:18:37,664
Yeah!
Indoor--We left the ocean
and everything?

00:18:37,664 --> 00:18:39,834
(laughing)
We wanna take it indoors.
We want it--

00:18:39,834 --> 00:18:41,164
a boat experience indoors?

00:18:41,164 --> 00:18:42,404
Now that's--That's years
and years down the line.

00:18:42,404 --> 00:18:45,304
I did not see stage four coming,
I gotta be honest.

00:18:45,304 --> 00:18:47,734
Inside for adult alcoholics?
For adult alcoholics, correct.

00:18:47,734 --> 00:18:48,934
Cheer, cheer!
Cheer, cheer!

00:18:48,934 --> 00:18:50,264
Captain, my captain.
Hip, hip, hoorah!

00:18:50,264 --> 00:18:51,434
Well, usually after
you start drinking

00:18:51,434 --> 00:18:52,704
the boat starts rocking anyway,
right?

00:18:52,704 --> 00:18:54,564
(laughs)
You're making money,

00:18:54,564 --> 00:18:56,064
you're--You're having fun
with it.

00:18:56,064 --> 00:19:00,034
You know, all you do is drive
around drunk people--Cheers--

00:19:00,034 --> 00:19:01,364
And have a great time.

00:19:01,364 --> 00:19:04,034
Here's the problem I have--
you can't scale.

00:19:04,034 --> 00:19:05,734
You're limited in the number
of boats you can place

00:19:05,734 --> 00:19:07,504
in any one bay.
I understand.

00:19:07,504 --> 00:19:10,004
And you're really limited
in how many places you can go.

00:19:10,004 --> 00:19:12,264
I'm looking for
a significant return.

00:19:12,264 --> 00:19:14,434
I just can't get there.

00:19:14,434 --> 00:19:16,634
I'm taking the anchor.
I'm out.

00:19:17,664 --> 00:19:19,504
Thank you for your time.

00:19:19,504 --> 00:19:21,004
(Robert) Here's the best thing
about your business.

00:19:21,004 --> 00:19:23,804
When you can be in business with
somebody you get along with,

00:19:23,804 --> 00:19:24,964
that's magical.

00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:26,304
Thank you.

00:19:26,304 --> 00:19:29,104
But beyond phase one,

00:19:29,104 --> 00:19:30,834
there's a lot of holes
in this boat.

00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:33,504
It's just not adding up.
I'm out.

00:19:33,504 --> 00:19:35,604
Robert, I hear ya.

00:19:35,604 --> 00:19:38,704
Our whole goal is to get
to this indoor ride...

00:19:38,704 --> 00:19:40,434
(laughter)
And there are steps
to get there.

00:19:40,434 --> 00:19:44,604
Shane, do you know
how crazy that sounds?

00:19:44,604 --> 00:19:46,504
It was really crazy for people
to open up a casino

00:19:46,504 --> 00:19:47,934
in--in a desert.

00:19:47,934 --> 00:19:49,664
True.
Hey, listen,

00:19:49,664 --> 00:19:51,164
I think there's
another marketing angle.

00:19:51,164 --> 00:19:53,134
So let's say you do something
like the riesling ride.

00:19:53,134 --> 00:19:54,804
Right?
Oh, that's a great idea.

00:19:54,804 --> 00:19:56,364
That's right, right? So what
is that? Two r's, right?
Yep.

00:19:56,364 --> 00:19:58,534
If you add
the relaxing riesling ride,

00:19:58,534 --> 00:20:00,334
what would that be?

00:20:00,334 --> 00:20:02,364
Oh, lord.
Arr.

00:20:02,364 --> 00:20:03,464
"arr, arr, arr."

00:20:03,464 --> 00:20:04,664
(laughter)
Right? Yeah.

00:20:04,664 --> 00:20:05,764
That's what
I'm falling in love with.

00:20:05,764 --> 00:20:08,064
But I have to be honest, guys.
I'm out.

00:20:08,064 --> 00:20:10,364
Daymond, thank you for
your time. I appreciate it.

00:20:10,364 --> 00:20:12,064
Arr!

00:20:12,064 --> 00:20:14,234
I was wrong. I called it
bad theater. It's good theater.

00:20:14,234 --> 00:20:16,604
It's good theater.
You guys are comics,

00:20:16,604 --> 00:20:18,304
and I actually think you got
a nice little business here.

00:20:18,304 --> 00:20:20,104
I would love to have you all
aboard. That would be--

00:20:20,104 --> 00:20:22,164
That would really solidify
what it is that we do.
I love boats.

00:20:22,164 --> 00:20:25,104
I enjoyed our time together.
I like the wine, also.

00:20:25,104 --> 00:20:26,664
Thank you, Kevin.
If there's any left,
I'll have some more.

00:20:26,664 --> 00:20:29,504
How many glasses have you had?
I'll keep going...

00:20:29,504 --> 00:20:31,304
(mark) Keep going, Kevin...
'cause this deal is just getting
better by the glass.

00:20:31,304 --> 00:20:32,704
'cause you finally get
a personality when you drink.

00:20:32,704 --> 00:20:34,034
So the way I look at it is,

00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:35,804
at the end of the day,
it's not investable,

00:20:35,804 --> 00:20:38,004
but it's not horrible.

00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:39,164
Just not investable.

00:20:39,164 --> 00:20:41,204
There's no way
to get a return from this.

00:20:41,204 --> 00:20:42,734
In five years,
we believe--

00:20:42,734 --> 00:20:45,404
Now if I have one more glass,
I may change my mind.
(daymond) Ooh.

00:20:45,404 --> 00:20:46,734
But you know what?
You're have a great time.

00:20:46,734 --> 00:20:49,404
You're making money. You made it
to the shark tank.

00:20:49,404 --> 00:20:51,034
You're very nice guys.

00:20:51,034 --> 00:20:53,064
Having said all that,
I'm so out.

00:20:53,064 --> 00:20:55,964
(chuckles) Thank you, Kevin.
I appreciate it.

00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:57,134
Cheers.

00:20:57,134 --> 00:20:58,764
Well, Barbara,
it's really up to you,

00:20:58,764 --> 00:21:00,064
and we really hope
that you'll consider us.

00:21:00,064 --> 00:21:01,934
Come on,
you're such wacky characters.

00:21:01,934 --> 00:21:05,434
I would have so much fun
sailing with you guys,

00:21:05,434 --> 00:21:07,664
but I couldn't sleep at night
if you had my money.

00:21:07,664 --> 00:21:11,504
You're a lot of fun, guys,
but unfortunately I'm out.

00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:14,404
Thank you, Barbara,
and I appreciate all your time.

00:21:14,404 --> 00:21:15,564
Thanks, guys.
(Shane) Thank you.

00:21:15,564 --> 00:21:17,164
(Nathan) Thanks, guys.
Thank you.

00:21:17,164 --> 00:21:18,964
I'm the first to buy a ticket

(laughs)

00:21:22,434 --> 00:21:23,964
Wow, that was fun.
(daymond) Poor guys.

00:21:23,964 --> 00:21:25,464
I have to tell you something,
though, Kevin.

00:21:25,464 --> 00:21:27,304
You get a lot nicer once
you have a little bit of wine.

00:21:27,304 --> 00:21:28,764

with an innovative resource
for the sharply dressed man.

00:21:48,404 --> 00:21:50,804
My name is David powers...
and I'm Scott tindel.

00:21:50,804 --> 00:21:52,904
And we're the founders
of tietry.

00:21:52,904 --> 00:21:56,464
We're asking you
for a $100,000 investment

00:21:56,464 --> 00:22:00,364
in exchange for
a 25% equity stake in tietry.

00:22:00,364 --> 00:22:03,434
Tietry is essentially
netflix for neckties.

00:22:03,434 --> 00:22:05,634
Scott and I,
both being attorneys,

00:22:05,634 --> 00:22:07,204
wear a lot of ties.

00:22:07,204 --> 00:22:10,204
But we realized that we were
wearing the same few

00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:11,364
over and over.

00:22:11,364 --> 00:22:12,534
When we started talking
to other people,

00:22:12,534 --> 00:22:14,134
we found out other guys were
just like us.

00:22:14,134 --> 00:22:17,104
And that's why a few months ago,
we launched tietry.

00:22:17,104 --> 00:22:19,764
Our subscribers get an unlimited
number of neckties delivered

00:22:19,764 --> 00:22:22,634
directly to their doorstep
for a low monthly price.

00:22:22,634 --> 00:22:24,134
They choose the ties they want

00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,464
and exchange them
as often as they want.

00:22:26,464 --> 00:22:28,704
For the price of
a couple of cups of coffee,

00:22:28,704 --> 00:22:30,204
our subscribers
can literally wear

00:22:30,204 --> 00:22:32,464
hundreds of dollars worth
of designer neckties

00:22:32,464 --> 00:22:34,034
every single month.

00:22:34,034 --> 00:22:36,434
We know that tietry is
the perfect business

00:22:36,434 --> 00:22:39,134
to break into
the men's access market.

00:22:39,134 --> 00:22:42,004
So... y'all wanna tie one on
with tietry?

00:22:42,004 --> 00:22:45,534
Okay, guys, what does it cost
you to acquire a customer?

00:22:45,534 --> 00:22:47,504
'cause I've never heard
of tietry before.

00:22:47,504 --> 00:22:49,304
We launched a few months ago.

00:22:49,304 --> 00:22:52,034
So far, we've spent virtually
nothing on advertising.

00:22:52,034 --> 00:22:54,964
All--We've been getting our
customers through free press,

00:22:54,964 --> 00:22:57,264
free publicity,
and through referrals.

00:22:57,264 --> 00:22:58,964
(Robert)
That's the entire model?
Yes.

00:22:58,964 --> 00:23:00,304
How many users
do you have today?

00:23:00,304 --> 00:23:02,364
Oh, we have approximately
110 subscribers right now.

00:23:02,364 --> 00:23:05,964
And the reason is, we took
these first six months

00:23:05,964 --> 00:23:07,734
and we're using it as
a proof of concept.

00:23:07,734 --> 00:23:10,634
Before we dumped a significant
amount of money into this,

00:23:10,634 --> 00:23:12,004
we wanted to be able
to prove

00:23:12,004 --> 00:23:14,734
that this would do
what we thought it did.

00:23:14,734 --> 00:23:15,964
I wear a tie every day.

00:23:15,964 --> 00:23:18,604
I spend thousands every year
on ties.

00:23:18,604 --> 00:23:20,104
I buy them
all around the world.
You do? Really?

00:23:20,104 --> 00:23:22,404
I look--And I look spectacular.
But they're all black.

00:23:22,404 --> 00:23:24,234
(men laugh)

00:23:24,234 --> 00:23:25,504
I look spectacular in them.

00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:28,704
Now at the end of the day,
what I wanna know is,

00:23:28,704 --> 00:23:30,864
where you add value for me?

00:23:30,864 --> 00:23:32,734
Well, k-Kevin,
here's how we add value.

00:23:32,734 --> 00:23:35,434
For example, our most--Our most
popular plan right now,

00:23:35,434 --> 00:23:38,204
the two tie at a time plan,
that's $15.99 a month.

00:23:38,204 --> 00:23:40,734
If you're diligent about
when you receive your ties,

00:23:40,734 --> 00:23:42,534
wearing it, and sending it back
the next day,

00:23:42,534 --> 00:23:45,504
you can get up to 8 to 10 ties
per month.

00:23:45,504 --> 00:23:49,434
A lot of our ties retail
anywhere from $80 to $90.

00:23:49,434 --> 00:23:52,204
So that's over $700 a month

00:23:52,204 --> 00:23:53,364
for $15 a month.

00:23:53,364 --> 00:23:54,864
How do we send it back?

00:23:54,864 --> 00:23:56,364
Um...

00:23:56,364 --> 00:23:58,234
well, I'll actually--I'll
show you the, uh, packages

00:23:58,234 --> 00:24:00,904
that you would receive.

00:24:00,904 --> 00:24:02,204
Gentlemen, most of
the sharks here, I'm sure,

00:24:02,204 --> 00:24:04,364
spend $300
on every tie they wear.

00:24:04,364 --> 00:24:06,604
(mark) not me.
(Robert) or more.

00:24:06,604 --> 00:24:07,634
Not you? Good for you
not me.

00:24:07,634 --> 00:24:09,064
For mark,
we have the cuban plan.

00:24:09,064 --> 00:24:10,934
That's where you only need a tie
once a year

00:24:10,934 --> 00:24:12,364
so that you can go to
the White House.

00:24:12,364 --> 00:24:14,804
(Robert laughs)

00:24:14,804 --> 00:24:16,164
How do you get
more subscribers?

00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:17,864
We're gonna implement
a referral program.

00:24:17,864 --> 00:24:19,664
We've found that
our best advertisers

00:24:19,664 --> 00:24:22,634
are guys that wear our ties,
and they go out, and people say,

00:24:22,634 --> 00:24:24,004
"Hey, that's a great tie.
Where'd you get it?"

00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,164
and they say, "It's tietry.
It's a rental."

00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:28,804
Well, are you planning on
Carrying any other category?

00:24:28,804 --> 00:24:31,404
Any other haberdashery such as
cuff links? Anything else?
We--we are. Yes.

00:24:31,404 --> 00:24:33,504
We can go to cuff links,
suspenders,

00:24:33,504 --> 00:24:36,404
vests, watches, sunglasses.

00:24:36,404 --> 00:24:38,434
Well, and the beauty of it is,
for $16 a month,

00:24:38,434 --> 00:24:40,964
if you get the tie and you don't
like it, you just send it back.

00:24:40,964 --> 00:24:42,134
There's no commitment either,

00:24:42,134 --> 00:24:43,904
so somebody can sign up
for, you know, $16,

00:24:43,904 --> 00:24:46,304
and--And if they say, "this
isn't for me," they just cancel.

00:24:46,304 --> 00:24:48,004
Or if you need a tie
for a special event--
You realize there's
a challenge here, guys.

00:24:48,004 --> 00:24:51,434
'cause how long have you
actually been renting the ties?

00:24:51,434 --> 00:24:55,104
We launched in January--
Uh, basically a soft launch.

00:24:55,104 --> 00:24:57,764
So you really haven't had to
deal with the issue of turn.

00:24:57,764 --> 00:25:00,464
Yet you know people can cancel
at any moment.

00:25:00,464 --> 00:25:02,204
What percentage of turn
do you think you'll get?

00:25:02,204 --> 00:25:04,404
Well, our--Our--Our renewal rate

00:25:04,404 --> 00:25:06,434
is, uh, basically 85% so far.

00:25:06,434 --> 00:25:09,164
So 15% turn so far?

00:25:09,164 --> 00:25:12,604
But there's Only
110 subscribers.
Yeah, that's not the problem.

00:25:12,604 --> 00:25:14,034
Look,
the--the problem is, guys,

00:25:14,034 --> 00:25:17,804
how--How long do you think you
can sustain getting free press?

00:25:17,804 --> 00:25:20,464
Well, let's give you
the benefit of the doubt.

00:25:20,464 --> 00:25:23,504
A thousand people
subscribed.

00:25:23,504 --> 00:25:25,604
You guys danced around
your apartments

00:25:25,604 --> 00:25:28,404
and you high fived,
and "ooh! A thousand people!"

00:25:28,404 --> 00:25:32,164
but it's Only gonna take
a 15% turn per month,

00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:34,364
it's gonna take
less than seven months

00:25:34,364 --> 00:25:35,404
for those thousand
to disappear,

00:25:35,404 --> 00:25:36,834
and you have to
replace them.

00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:40,664
If we do lose
those 15% of subscribers,

00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,934
the next 15% of subscribers
we get,

00:25:42,934 --> 00:25:44,264
we don't have to replace
inventory for them

00:25:44,264 --> 00:25:45,864
'cause we already have
the inventory for them.

00:25:45,864 --> 00:25:47,764
But that's great,
but it's not my point.

00:25:47,764 --> 00:25:49,264
N-No, let--Let me address
your point.

00:25:49,264 --> 00:25:50,564
With our subscription model,

00:25:50,564 --> 00:25:52,764
if we sell
a thousand subscriptions,

00:25:52,764 --> 00:25:55,164
the next month, we're gonna sell
a thousand subscriptions.

00:25:55,164 --> 00:25:57,634
(Robert) I love that model.
It's a fantastic model.

00:25:57,634 --> 00:26:00,764
I just don't think you have
enough of a subscriber base

00:26:00,764 --> 00:26:02,434
to justify the business.

00:26:02,434 --> 00:26:05,234
I think you just gotta
test it out a little more.

00:26:05,234 --> 00:26:07,004
I'm out.

00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:10,804
Well, and--Both Scott and I,

00:26:10,804 --> 00:26:12,604

00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,734
living on 5-Hour energy drink,
basically.

00:26:14,734 --> 00:26:17,464
Uh, but w-When Scott leaves
his job,

00:26:17,464 --> 00:26:20,334
he'll--He'll be able to sell.
Okay, no, stop right there.

00:26:20,334 --> 00:26:21,504
Who is he going to sell to?

00:26:21,504 --> 00:26:23,204
Are you just gonna walk
up and down the street

00:26:23,204 --> 00:26:25,804
and say, "buy a subscription
to tietry"?

00:26:25,804 --> 00:26:28,434
Well, if I could go downtown
in downtown mobile

00:26:28,434 --> 00:26:29,634
and go to
the biggest office building

00:26:29,634 --> 00:26:31,804
where there are hundreds of guys
wearing ties

00:26:31,804 --> 00:26:34,564
and go sign up ten guys a day...
go on to the next city.

00:26:34,564 --> 00:26:36,234
But then what?

00:26:36,234 --> 00:26:37,504
Well--
then you'll be hanging yourself
with those ties.

00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:40,464
Daymond, we've been approached

00:26:40,464 --> 00:26:42,534
by Three different
college students

00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:45,904
on different campuses, wanting
to be campus reps from us.

00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:47,064
And--
All right,
let's stop right there.

00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:48,234
I'm gonna make things
a little interesting

00:26:48,234 --> 00:26:49,404

00:26:49,404 --> 00:26:50,904
I like you guys, all right?

00:26:50,904 --> 00:26:53,604
But I don't wanna be perceived
as a greedy Mr. Wonderful.

00:26:53,604 --> 00:26:56,704
So I'm gonna say I'll put up
$50,000 of what you need,

00:26:56,704 --> 00:26:58,904
and I won't say for how much.

00:26:58,904 --> 00:27:01,964
I'll let some other shark--
If you can convince one,

00:27:01,964 --> 00:27:04,864
or sharkette--Decide
how much of the company

00:27:04,864 --> 00:27:06,604
we should own
for the $100,000.

00:27:06,604 --> 00:27:08,034
It won't be me.

00:27:08,034 --> 00:27:10,064
Boy, I like me sometimes.

00:27:10,064 --> 00:27:11,304
(laughs)

00:27:11,304 --> 00:27:12,704
You're quite the gentlemen.

00:27:12,704 --> 00:27:14,934
There's $50,000 on the table.

00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:16,534
Can you convince another shark
to play?

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,430
One shark is out.

Kevin has offered
half the money they are seeking

00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,460
if they can get another shark
on board.

00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,160

how much of the company should
be taken for that $100,000.

00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,830
Okay.

00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,160
Well, with that in mind,
I would love to ask Robert

00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,600
if he'd be interested
in coming back in,

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,930
since now he knows that

00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:49,660
he wouldn't be on the hook
for that full $100,000.

00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,730
If--I know you were interested.
Oh, I-I don't think the $100,000
was--Was my issue.

00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:54,230
I'm out at this point.

Two don't wear a tie.

But I have a strong opinion
on it,

00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,860
even though
I don't wear a tie.

00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:05,330
I think your young guy market
is the perfect person.

00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:07,860
I, in fact, very much like
the idea you just mentioned

00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,500
about marketing it through
college kids.

00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,760
There's nothing more fun

00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,760
than getting a little package
in the mail.

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,630
Popping out a fresh new tie.

00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:18,600
And plus,
they're easy to ship.

00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,300
But what I don't like is that
you only have 110 subscribers.

00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,800
You can't get an investor
in this deal yet.

00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,100
It hasn't been proven.

00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,460

00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:32,030

Thank you, Barbara.

Ooh.

00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,830

00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,630
Daymond, as you know, it's about
who can get out there first

00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,060
and who can gain
market share.

00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:46,200
So I didn't hear
not one word about fashion

00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,930
in this whole discussion.
Is that a good or bad thing?

00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,600
I didn't hear about
double Windsor knots.
(Robert) wow.

00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,300
I didn't hear about how a check
would lay with this,

00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,360
or the cuff links
and the beauty and the love,

00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:00,100
and the excitement about
the beauty of a tie.
Mm.

00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,200
And for that reason, you're not
obsessed over this business

00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,760
like we all are
over our businesses.

00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,930

00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,400

00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,830
Boy, that's cold.

00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,300
Well, as our sign
back here says,

00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,830
we believe a stately neck
is manhood's manliest part.

00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:18,630
And So, uh, we do feel
that way.

00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:22,160
I'm sorry we didn't get there
sooner, obviously.

00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,400
There's one
non-Tie-Wearing shark left.

00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,100
Well, mark, we're asking you
to invest in us.

00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,000
We--we can make this work.

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,760
One question--What's your cost
of customer acquisition

00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,900
once you get beyond
the P.R. Phase?

00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,130
Because
it's proof of concept,

00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:40,760
we're still trying to find
that number.

00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,260
But we believe that we can
provide customers

00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,560
at about $10 to $12 a month,

00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,260
which is about the cost
of one month's subscription.

00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,300
But you've never tested that.

00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:53,730
We--we had some testing,
but we certainly don't have

00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,260
mountains and mountains of data
at this point.

00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,230
The--but with
the referral program,

00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:59,100
uh, you know, that--
That would cost us about--

00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,800
That would be about $10 a month.

00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,960
That's a stretch.

00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,660
You guys are guessing.
You guys are hoping.

00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,830
You don't have a solution.

00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,700
You haven't
thought this through.

00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,230

I'm out.

Typical missions for us

Because of this,
virtually all of us are taking

some sort of supplement
or energy shot,

and then they bring you
right down with a crash.

00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,030
And in that environment,

00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:02,430
lives can be lost if you're not

Okay.

00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,800
You only have in there
exactly what you need

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,730
and nothing else.
Got it. Okay.

00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:13,900
Rob, I see here it says,

00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,100
"prepared for
special operations forces."

00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,900
Are you okay to say that?

00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,360
You have their approval?
I'm okay to say exactly that.

00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,600
It's not officially endorsed
by the Marine corps.

00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,760
This is something
that was created

00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,730
by Special operations forces
personnel.

00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:27,700
(Robert) How did you know
what to put in it?

00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,400
And do you have a patent on
a formula or some proprietary--

00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,430
Well, we do have
proprietary ingredients

00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,930
in the formula, ma'am.
But we have...

00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:36,400
some ingredients
have to be disclosed

00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,660
because of, you know,
recommended daily allowances

00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,030
and we do that,

00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:41,060
but we do have some ingredients
that are proprietary

00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,400
just for us.

00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,360
The ingredients themselves
are really not that--

00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,830
I mean, they're--
they're important,

00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,800
but that's not
the Barrier to entry.

00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,930
The Barrier to entry
is marketing.

00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:52,560
It's an energy drink,

00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,460
and the differentiator is
army special ops.

00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,100
So the challenge here is,

00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,130
how do we get it out
into the general market?

00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:03,160
With just a couple of tweaks,
it's a nutrition shot.

00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,660
This is like a--This is like
a daily vitamin that you take.

00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,330
You should have ruckpack.

00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:08,960
If you take
a different energy shot,

00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,630
you should really watch
when you use them

00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:12,160
because they're really
not good for you.

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,260
So it's better?
This is good for you.

00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,460
Okay.
This is healthy.

00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:19,060
Are you working full-time now
in the military?

00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,100
Yes, sir. I'm an active duty
Marine corps Officer.

00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,860
My current duty station
is annapolis, Maryland.

00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,230
Mm.
I'm an accounting professor

00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,630
at the United States
naval academy.

00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:31,100
And before you were that,
what were you in civilian life?

00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:34,830
Well, before I was doing that,
I had jobs with Spec ops units.

00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:37,360
Spec op units--
Are you in special forces?

00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,530
Well, right now,
I'm an accounting professor.

00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,860
But before that, were you?
(laughter)

00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,030
Yes, sir.
You were in special forces?

00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,360
Yes, sir.
So, rob,

00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,700
since you--You're an accounting
professor right now

00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,200
and you're working,
obviously...

00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,160
Yes, sir.
"a," how much more time
do you have left

00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,660
as an accounting professor
or your, um, your next--

00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,160
Two and a half years.

00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,000
So who runs the company while
you're operating as a professor?

00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,630
Well, while I'm operating
as a professor,

00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:59,800
that job ends for me
at 4:00 p.m. Every day.

00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,460
I go home, spend a little time
with family,

00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,500
and then I start ruckpack.

00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,430
So you asked for $75,000
for 10%.

00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:07,830
Yes, sir.

00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,660
Um, so you're valuing
the company at $750,000.
Yes.

00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,930
What--what do you want to do
with the money,

00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:12,930
and where are you currently?

00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,530
I want to scale
my manufacturing.

00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:16,130
I know that if
I order enough,

00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:18,360
I can work the cost down
to close to 50 cents.

00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,200
And what's your cost today?

00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,130
My costs today are about
80 to 85 cents.

00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:23,900
80, 85.
(Robert) And what are you
selling it for today?

00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,700
$2.19 online, and my direct
Sellers are getting $1.65.

00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,300
When you sent out that product
before, it sold out.

00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,330
Yes.
How many bottles?
How quick did it sell out?

00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:34,730
15,000 shots in a little over
a month and a half.

00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:38,260
Rob, do you have
any inventory today?

00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,430
I have no inventory today.

00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:41,200
The 80,000 shots
that we have coming in

00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,260
will be here
in about 10 to 14 days.

00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,400
Do you have to pay
for the inventory ahead of time?

00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,960
I do.
So the minute
you place the order,

00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,030
you gotta put the cash
out there?

00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,300
I've put 50% of the cash up.

00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,300
How much cash have you put in
so far?

00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:57,000
Of my own personal money?
About $90,000 to $95,000.

00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,130
Wow.
Whoa.

00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:59,260
(Robert) of your money?
Yes.

00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,530
And you mentioned "We"
a few times.

00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:02,630
Do you have partners
in the business?

00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:03,800
I do. We are--

00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,930
The company itself has
16 total owners.

00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:09,530
Wow.
It's 80% military family-Owned.

00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:11,730
And what percentage do you own?
How much do you still own?

00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:14,560
I own 43%.
My wife Owns almost 2%.

00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,260
So, rob, you put up $90,000

00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,000
or was the total
among 16 people?

00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,500
I put $90,000.

00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,600
And how much did you raise
from the other 15 people total?

00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,130
Total amount in the company
is probably about $240,000-Ish.

00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:27,430
Ooh.

00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,530
And of--of that,
you put up $90,000 yourself?
Yes.

00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:31,060
Wow.
What did you spend it all on?

00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,900
Yeah, that seems like a lot.
Web sites, r&amp;d.

00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,860
We did
the first 20,000 shots,

00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,200
so now
I still have the money

00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,160
to already pay for
the 80,000 shots.

00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:43,430
I also--Because caffeine is
the largest drug in the world--

00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,900
I would be stupid
not to at least offer

00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,330
a caffeinated shot,

00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:48,730
so I have
20,000 of those coming

00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:50,400
that I've already
paid for as well.

00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,560
Okay, so you prepaid your--
No, product.

00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,100
Basically,
you prepaid inventory.

00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,430
Yes, sir. Yes, we have.
(daymond)
Yes, you have inventory.

00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:57,860
Okay.
So is your biggest problem today
in your business

00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,560
getting sales
or filling existing sales?

00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,900
Filling existing.

00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,960
I've got Sellers waiting--
That keep calling me.

00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,600
"When will I get more?
When will I get more?"

00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,760
so the $75,000 today,
I'm assuming,

00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,130
is all going to buy inventory?

00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:11,960
Yes.
Okay.

00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,130
You're successful.

00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:16,260
You're giving up 10% today
for $75,000.

00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,800
What happens tomorrow?

00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,460
It sounds like the business
isn't generating enough cash

00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,860
for you to buy inventory.

00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:27,230
What if you need another $75,000
or $200,000 or $500,000?

00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,530
There's gotta be a different way
to build this business

00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,760
than every time you grow,

00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,600
having to sell equity
to pay for the inventory.

00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:38,200
I think that with the 20,000
caffeinated shots I have coming

00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,200
and the 80,000 shots that I have
of the nutrition shot,

00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,100
I'll be able
to do that already.

00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,260
The $75,000 that you give me

00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,900
will just be so that there's
not a backlog.

00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:52,060
Unfortunately, I've invested

00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:55,430
in similar products that would
compete against this.

00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,700
I'm out.

00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,260
Understood. Thank you.
I appreciate your time.

00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,900
Robert, I think you have
a compelling story.

00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,730
And who wouldn't
fall in love with you?

00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:09,400
I'm in love with you.

00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,200
I'm a little in love
with you, too.

00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,700
(laughs)
You're a Younger model of my
husband who went to annapolis,

00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,300
and I think I'm gonna trade
him in and marry you instead.

00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,360
(mark and Robert laugh)
But I am troubled

00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,360
by the, uh, $240,000 invested.

00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,730
It seems like a lot of money
for where you stand right now.

00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:25,560
I'm also troubled by the fact
that you have...

00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,830
43% interest?
Yes.

00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,760
And you're willing to give away
another 10%, which puts you--

00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,860
I just feel like you're
eating away at the company

00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,330
and don't have enough
to show for it.

00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,330
But everybody gets diluted,
not him.
(Robert) Yeah.

00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:36,760
Yeah, okay, but I'm out.

00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,400
The story's very powerful.

00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,530
It's good enough for a sniper
on the battlefield,

00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:48,430
and I want the same product
for me.

00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:51,630
This whole jittery finger thing,
caffeine--I buy into 100%.

00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:53,900
I get it. Everybody'll get that
right away.

00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:58,760
Normally, I would want more,

00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,100
but I like it a lot.

00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,960
This is very uncharacteristic
of me.

00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,730
I'll give you what you want.

00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:05,560
What?!

00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,730
I'll give you 75k for 10%.

00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:11,730
I'll simplify things.
I love the idea.

00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:14,130
I-I'd love the opportunity
to invest in you.

00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:16,460
The problem is,
I only get half of you.

00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,800
Business doesn't work
after 4:00 p.m. Time,

00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,700
and it doesn't work
on a schedule.

00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,800
And when things have to happen,
they have to happen.

00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,830
You've gotta be there
when the business needs you,

00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:30,330
and I don't see that
as being possible right now,

00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:32,830
so for that reason, I'm out.

00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:34,560
Okay. Understood.

00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,460
Well, rob, here's what I know.

00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,000
Marines always find a way.

00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,500
They do.

00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,160
So I'm not bothered by the fact
you--You have a full-Time job

00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,300
serving the country until 4:00.

00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,660
But I think you're gonna need
more cash

00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,600
than the $75,000.

00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,960
So... Here's what I'm thinking.

00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,860
If Kevin will have me--

00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:56,230
$150,000 from the two of us

00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:58,360
for 20%.

00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,600
You know what? Robert's right.
You need more cash.

00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,100
I'll do that deal with him.

00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:06,500
Now you've just doubled
what you came in here for.

00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,700
