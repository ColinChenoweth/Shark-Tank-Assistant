00:00:02,334 --> 00:00:04,670
in an all-new season
of "Shark Tank,"

00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,139
where hopeful entrepreneurs
from across the country

00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:09,875
dream of a chance
to secure an investment

00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:11,710

Who wants a drink?
You're gonna need a drink.

00:00:16,982 --> 00:00:19,351
Saliva goes down,
and they suck it up.

00:00:19,351 --> 00:00:21,253
If the sharks hear
a great idea,

00:00:21,253 --> 00:00:24,290
they're ready to invest
using their own money.

00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,991

a million dollars.

00:00:25,991 --> 00:00:29,128

must convince a shark

to invest the full amount
they're asking for,

00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,145

So, we have had inquiries,
and people say,

00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,894
"Well, why couldn't I
wear a face

to take it off?"

an edge here

having to wash it.
Wow!

as opposed to wash off?

00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,952
Right.
(Robert) It's incredible.

what?

You can just eat it?

00:04:20,058 --> 00:04:22,361
Why?
Is that just a nasty habit,
or are you trying to show us--

00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:24,797
It's made with vegetable dyes,
and it's all water-based,

00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,432
and it's very safe
for kids.

00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,168
Let's go to the economics.
Tell us about the business,

00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:30,969
your revenues, your costs.

00:04:30,969 --> 00:04:32,438
We're in our fifth year
of business.

00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,440
And let me preface this--
This is a part-time job

00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,874
for me and my wife.

00:04:35,874 --> 00:04:38,477
And we literally have an office
above our garage,

00:04:38,477 --> 00:04:40,112
and we ship
out of our garage.

00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:43,649
Our first year, we did
$6,700 worth of sales,

00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:45,484
and last year,
we did $102,000.

00:04:45,484 --> 00:04:48,520
We anticipate doing $105,000
this year.

00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,191
$102,000,
and you are valuing

00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:56,395
that you you have a part-time
$1.8 million company...

00:04:56,395 --> 00:04:57,930
yes.
In your attic.

00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,598
Why are you worth
$1.8 million?

00:04:59,598 --> 00:05:03,769
Well, first of all, we haven't
even tapped into the big box.

00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:06,138
We have about 400 customers
that are all retail,

00:05:06,138 --> 00:05:07,873
small mom-and-pop shops.

00:05:07,873 --> 00:05:10,042
We have
licensed ncaa teams.

00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:11,677
We have a local license--

00:05:11,677 --> 00:05:13,979
Texas tech, tcu,
and a&amp;m.

00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:16,482
What does it cost you to make?
What do you sell 'em for?

00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,484
So we wholesale them
for $2.50,

00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:22,488
and our cost will range
from 25 cents to 60 cents.

00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,022
It's all volume-driven.

00:05:24,022 --> 00:05:26,425
Great margin.
Only our designs
are all retailed

00:05:26,425 --> 00:05:27,960
for $4.99.
(Daymond) It is
a great margin.

00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,294
(Mark) So you're paying
10 per--
It's a $5 item.

00:05:29,294 --> 00:05:32,798
And, Doug, on the $102,000
that you sold last year,

00:05:32,798 --> 00:05:34,967
how much money did you
make on that?

00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:38,070
We made $32,000.

00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,138
The numbers just don't add up.

00:05:40,138 --> 00:05:43,075
Okay, kiddies, it's time
for you to leave the shark tank.

00:05:43,075 --> 00:05:45,777
Your daddy's asked
for $1.8 million value

00:05:45,777 --> 00:05:48,780
on his company.
This could get very ugly.

00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,816
Yeah, we're gonna put on
some ugly faces...
Bye, guys.

00:05:50,816 --> 00:05:52,718
And, uh, talk to your Dad.
(laughs)

00:05:52,718 --> 00:05:54,052
Are there competitors?

00:05:54,052 --> 00:05:55,854
There's no competitors.
Okay.

00:05:55,854 --> 00:05:57,422
And there can't be
any competitors,

00:05:57,422 --> 00:05:58,657
because of our patent.

00:05:58,657 --> 00:06:00,559
(Robert) But--But, Doug,
that can't be true.

00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:02,694
I've bought stickers--

00:06:02,694 --> 00:06:03,962

The key is full face.

00:06:03,962 --> 00:06:05,264
Full face.
Full face.

00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:06,765
What's your full-time job,
Doug?

00:06:06,765 --> 00:06:08,300
I work for xerox
selling copiers.

00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,303
You've got these big margins.
It's working for you.
Yeah.

00:06:11,303 --> 00:06:13,972
Why still sell copiers
instead of do this full-time?

00:06:13,972 --> 00:06:15,741
Well, we've got two kids.
We got--

00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:17,442
We got into
the real estate bust

00:06:17,442 --> 00:06:19,244
in east texas.
Okay, so you gotta
pay the bills, basically.

00:06:19,244 --> 00:06:21,980
I gotta pay the bills.
What's the $450,000 for?

00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,449
$300,000 would get me
on a salary

00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:25,918
for the next three years,

00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:28,954

00:06:30,722 --> 00:06:32,090
(Daymond) one second,
one second. Doug.

00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,792
You just basically said,

00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:38,330
"I want $100,000 a year
for 3 years."

00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,465
I think that's absurd.

00:06:40,465 --> 00:06:43,235
I-I didn't make any money
from my business for nine years.

00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:46,838

Doug, I-I really like
the product.

00:06:52,711 --> 00:06:55,013
But I gotta tell you,
when you said,

00:06:55,013 --> 00:06:57,416
"I'm gonna take a $100,000
salary for the next 3 years,

00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,318

with all due respect, you gotta

00:07:06,825 --> 00:07:10,062
When I started my business,
do you know how many years

00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:11,530
before I made $100,000?

00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,298
And you're coming here
and asking me

00:07:13,298 --> 00:07:15,267
to guarantee that for you?

00:07:15,267 --> 00:07:18,103

00:07:19,838 --> 00:07:22,608

alongside with you.

Here's how I'll do it.

00:07:40,826 --> 00:07:43,562

to go in with me.

He's been awfully quiet.
(Lori) Yes.

Um...

I gotta tell you--

00:08:19,965 --> 00:08:21,400
So, when I first
took over the mavs,

00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,934
no one would go
to the games.

00:08:22,934 --> 00:08:25,137

had to hand out tickets.

I ran was--

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,840

offered me $5 million.

It was more money
than I had ever dreamed of.

00:10:43,298 --> 00:10:46,034
I went home,
and I told my wife about it.

00:10:46,034 --> 00:10:48,770

and she said,

00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:49,371
"I don't believe
you started this business

"to work for somebody else

00:12:29,504 --> 00:12:32,173
35% equity in the company.

00:12:35,043 --> 00:12:38,012
So, I would like
to counter back, Mark.

00:12:38,012 --> 00:12:42,951
$450,000 at the 40%
that I started with,

00:12:42,951 --> 00:12:46,788

00:12:53,761 --> 00:12:55,263
plus the $80k guaranteed
for 3 years,

00:12:55,263 --> 00:12:59,834

our two favorite pastimes?

00:16:31,007 --> 00:16:32,776
Ladies and gentlemen...

00:16:32,776 --> 00:16:34,744
Let me introduce to you
what has been called

00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:38,248
the greatest invention
of all time...

00:16:38,815 --> 00:16:41,318
the Arkeg!
(laughs)

00:16:41,318 --> 00:16:41,952
Ta-Da!
(laughter)

00:16:41,952 --> 00:16:44,688
Drink...
drink... and game.

00:16:44,688 --> 00:16:47,157
(Lori laughs)
Oh, lord.

00:16:47,157 --> 00:16:47,924
Drink n' game!

00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:49,726
It not only pours
any beer you want,

00:16:49,726 --> 00:16:52,195
but it comes pre-loaded

00:16:52,195 --> 00:16:52,896
with some of the most popular
classic arcade games.

00:16:52,896 --> 00:16:55,465
Is it a fridge?

00:16:55,699 --> 00:16:58,001
It's a keg.

00:17:01,037 --> 00:17:03,106
It doesn't just pour beer.

00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:03,807
How about some wine
for the chef of the house

00:17:03,807 --> 00:17:07,110
after a long day?
(clink)

00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:07,978
(laughing)

00:17:07,978 --> 00:17:11,681
That's how you drink your wine,
Kevin--From a tap.

00:17:11,681 --> 00:17:15,185
Wine's not your thing,
what about some root beer

00:17:15,185 --> 00:17:17,154
for the kids
and their friends?

00:17:17,154 --> 00:17:19,022
Put one
in your family room,

00:17:19,022 --> 00:17:21,158
in your game room,
your man cave.

00:17:21,158 --> 00:17:21,925
Who wants a drink?

00:17:21,925 --> 00:17:25,061
Guys, you're gonna need a drink
when you try to sell these.

00:17:25,867 --> 00:17:27,869
I'm out.

00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:28,336
Whoa!
(Brant) That was fast.

00:17:28,336 --> 00:17:30,071
That's a record.

00:17:30,071 --> 00:17:33,942
Was it the beer, or was it
the game that got you out?

00:17:33,942 --> 00:17:34,309
It was the combination
thereof.

00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:37,579
I just don't see it, guys.
Sorry.

00:17:37,579 --> 00:17:40,615
Wait a minute.
Are you serious with this?

00:17:40,615 --> 00:17:42,517
Absolutely.
It's a great product.

00:17:42,517 --> 00:17:43,952
(Robert) How much is it?

00:17:43,952 --> 00:17:45,487
$4,000 retail.

00:17:45,487 --> 00:17:46,788
(Daymond) Wow.
(Kevin) $4,000?

00:17:46,788 --> 00:17:48,490
Have you sold any of them?

00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:49,190
Absolutely.
We've sold 20.

00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,159
(Daymond) You come in here,
guys.

00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:54,696
You're very, very rude.

00:17:54,696 --> 00:17:56,231
You haven't even
offered me a beer.
My apologies, Daymond.

00:17:56,231 --> 00:17:58,533
Wine, root beer, beer?

00:17:58,533 --> 00:17:59,000
Can I pour that thing?
Let me see that.

00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,836
(Brant) By all means.
It's actually

00:18:01,836 --> 00:18:03,038
capitalizing
on the current trend,

00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:05,507
which is
pour your own beer.

00:18:05,507 --> 00:18:07,409
What do you got in wine?
Yeah, I'll have a wine.

00:18:07,409 --> 00:18:09,344
It's a 2010 estate Pinot noir
from central coast, California.

00:18:09,344 --> 00:18:11,079
Oh, please, I'll have some.

00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:13,281
Kevin, would like some, uh,
night train or ripple?

00:18:13,281 --> 00:18:16,184
No, no, I'm doing some,
uh, pinot, I think.
(laughing)

00:18:16,184 --> 00:18:17,986
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

00:18:17,986 --> 00:18:20,455
Yes.

00:18:20,455 --> 00:18:22,691
I see this as--
As more of a gimmick.
(clink)

00:18:22,691 --> 00:18:26,194
I don't see myself
as being in the Arkeg business.

00:18:26,194 --> 00:18:29,431
I'm out.

00:18:29,431 --> 00:18:31,566
(Robert) I remember
when games like this

00:18:31,566 --> 00:18:33,268
were very, very popular.
So I bought, like, 12 games.

00:18:33,268 --> 00:18:35,770
I put 'em in my basement.

00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:36,871
I thought my friends

00:18:36,871 --> 00:18:38,173
could go down there all the time
and play.

00:18:38,173 --> 00:18:40,008
I gotta tell you,
I haven't been in that room

00:18:40,008 --> 00:18:43,445
for eight years.

00:18:43,445 --> 00:18:46,014
You sold 20 units over 2 years.

00:18:46,014 --> 00:18:48,316
That's low.

00:18:48,316 --> 00:18:51,152
I'm out.

00:18:51,152 --> 00:18:54,489
Guys, I think the beauty
of games now

00:18:54,489 --> 00:18:56,024
is that they're small,
you can play it on your tablet.

00:18:56,024 --> 00:18:58,593
This is just really
a dinosaur.

00:18:59,127 --> 00:19:02,797
I just don't think
it's anything for me. I'm out.

00:19:06,701 --> 00:19:08,903
Mr. Wonderful,
what are you doing?

00:19:08,903 --> 00:19:12,674
I'm, uh, looking at it
as a limited opportunity.

00:19:12,674 --> 00:19:15,577
Not every business
is destined to be huge.

00:19:15,577 --> 00:19:16,378
I prefer to invest
in the ones that are.

00:19:16,378 --> 00:19:18,246
Kevin,
with your capital injection,

00:19:18,246 --> 00:19:20,115
we can get
our price point low enough

00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:22,717
to get into big box stores.

00:19:22,717 --> 00:19:24,686
You're talking about
a high-end refrigerator.

00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,022
"look, honey, we can get
an arcade game

00:19:27,022 --> 00:19:29,658
with beer that comes
out of it."

00:19:29,658 --> 00:19:31,493
We have a lot of wives that
buy them for their husbands.

00:19:31,493 --> 00:19:33,628
It's a great--
Listen, guys,
I appreciate the wine,

00:19:33,628 --> 00:19:35,463
and it's actually
quite good.
Thank you.

00:19:35,463 --> 00:19:37,032
I'm gonna take a pass.
I'm out.

00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,602
No counteroffer?

00:19:40,602 --> 00:19:43,438
All right, I'll get Lori
to give you $50,000.

00:19:43,438 --> 00:19:44,739
(laughs)

00:19:44,739 --> 00:19:45,807
Lori, we'll take it.

00:19:45,807 --> 00:19:47,942
(laughter)

00:19:47,942 --> 00:19:48,376
Gentlemen, cheers to Arkeg.

00:19:48,376 --> 00:19:50,512
Cheers.
Thank you, guys.

00:19:50,512 --> 00:19:51,680
Good luck, guys.
(Brant) Appreciate it.

00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,756
Cheers.
Good luck.

Hello. My name
is Dan Rothwell,

and my product is Dura-tent.

00:20:31,595 --> 00:20:36,199
I am seeking $50,000 for a 30%
equity stake in our company.

00:20:36,199 --> 00:20:40,136
Spring is the official start
of picnics and parties

00:20:40,136 --> 00:20:43,273
with family and friends
in the great outdoors.

00:20:43,273 --> 00:20:46,042
But there is nothing
more irritating

00:20:46,042 --> 00:20:48,778
than standing around
swatting the flies

00:20:48,778 --> 00:20:51,948
away from the food,
and rightfully so.
(laughs)

00:20:51,948 --> 00:20:56,052
How many times
have we seen the flies

00:20:56,052 --> 00:20:58,054
hovering around and getting
on that dog poop

00:20:58,054 --> 00:20:59,756
and walking around?
(buzzing)

00:20:59,756 --> 00:21:01,124
Then that fly says...

00:21:01,124 --> 00:21:03,593
(Mark laughs)
"there's a party going on.

00:21:03,593 --> 00:21:05,862
I'm gonna go walk

And it does.

00:21:07,764 --> 00:21:09,866
And it leaves behind
little particulate

00:21:09,866 --> 00:21:12,602
of the disgust it just
picked up along the way.

00:21:12,602 --> 00:21:14,204
Ew.

00:21:14,204 --> 00:21:16,039
Poop potato salad,
anybody?

00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:18,475
No, thank you.

of a fly's day.

00:21:22,946 --> 00:21:26,049
(Robert laughs)
Here's flies swarming
around the garbage.

00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:27,884
Now they stick
their tongue out,

00:21:27,884 --> 00:21:30,587
and saliva goes down, and they
mix it with your food,

00:21:30,587 --> 00:21:33,223
and they suck it up,
and it's disgusting.

00:21:33,223 --> 00:21:37,427
Flies leave behind parasites,
larvae, salmonella,

00:21:37,427 --> 00:21:41,264
and even antibiotic-Resistant
e. Coli.

00:21:41,264 --> 00:21:43,333
The same types of bacteria
that hospitalize

00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:46,136
thousands of people
across the U.S.

00:21:46,136 --> 00:21:47,837
Each and every year,

00:21:47,837 --> 00:21:50,040
and unfortunately,
some of these people die.

00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,310
Is this what you want for your
family and friends, sharks?

00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,045
No!

00:21:55,045 --> 00:21:56,379
Exactly not.

(sharks laughing)

00:22:04,588 --> 00:22:06,623
As you can see,
it's a full enclosure.

00:22:06,623 --> 00:22:08,825
Are we going camping
with that food?

00:22:08,825 --> 00:22:11,261
We're going to the backyard
parties and picnics.

00:22:11,261 --> 00:22:14,264
It's a full enclosure, not just
a little pop-up umbrella.

00:22:14,264 --> 00:22:17,701
A little velcro on the door.
Flip it up, get your food.

00:22:17,701 --> 00:22:19,936
Look at how much food
this protects.

00:22:19,936 --> 00:22:22,372

easy to set up.

How many have you sold?
50,000 units.

00:22:31,448 --> 00:22:32,983
(Robert) Wow.
Wow.

00:22:32,983 --> 00:22:34,451
Where do you sell them?
How much do they sell for?

00:22:34,451 --> 00:22:36,820
It sells for $19.95--
On my picnic.

00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,689
My banquet--Between, uh,
$29.95 and $34.95.

00:22:39,689 --> 00:22:42,592
What's your cost?
My cost is, uh,

00:22:42,592 --> 00:22:46,062
$4.65 on my picnic
and $7.27 on my banquet.

00:22:46,062 --> 00:22:49,299
Out of the 50,000,
where are most of them sold?

00:22:49,299 --> 00:22:51,001
County fairs.

00:22:51,001 --> 00:22:53,203
This is a product
that screams demonstration.

00:22:53,203 --> 00:22:54,804
That's the problem, right?

00:22:54,804 --> 00:22:57,540
Or screams a media

00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:00,310
that gets into the, uh,
awareness of people

00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,846
that they have the product
available to them,

00:23:02,846 --> 00:23:06,182
so when they go into the store
and they see it, so...

00:23:06,182 --> 00:23:07,550
I've seen little mesh screens...
yes.

00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,886
That you put over
individual bowls

00:23:09,886 --> 00:23:11,488
or plates.
Yep.

00:23:11,488 --> 00:23:13,390
Why is this better?

00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,758
We are a full enclosure.

00:23:14,758 --> 00:23:17,227
It is not going to
blow away on you.

00:23:17,227 --> 00:23:19,129
You have a large banquet,
you're having a lot of food.

00:23:19,129 --> 00:23:21,564
So, Dan, how did you
come up with this?

00:23:21,564 --> 00:23:23,800
What's your background?
I'm an engineer--
Electrical engineer.

00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,802
Uh, pulse power,
power electronics.

00:23:25,802 --> 00:23:28,505
I went fusion research
to excimer laser technology,

00:23:28,505 --> 00:23:30,407
and I sold my stock
and stepped away.

00:23:30,407 --> 00:23:33,910
My goal was to take
a product from inception

00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,578
to the consumer market.

00:23:35,578 --> 00:23:37,514
I had some
technology ideas.

00:23:37,514 --> 00:23:39,616
We're sitting around
my brother-In-Law's pool,

00:23:39,616 --> 00:23:43,186
and mom is doing this, and we
came up with some sketches.

00:23:43,186 --> 00:23:45,588
So you go from high-Tech
laser blasting aliens

00:23:45,588 --> 00:23:47,057
to fly tents?
Exactly.

00:23:47,057 --> 00:23:48,591
I love it.
(laughs)

00:23:48,591 --> 00:23:50,927
But the numbers don't add up.
If you've got 300% margins

00:23:50,927 --> 00:23:53,730
and you're doing $140,000
in business,

00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:56,633
um... right?
Yes.

00:23:56,633 --> 00:24:01,071
Then how--why don't you have
just a huge bottom line?

00:24:01,071 --> 00:24:05,075
I'm--So last year, the majority
of my business was wholesale

00:24:05,075 --> 00:24:07,644
more than it was retail.
Gotcha. Okay,
what's the breakdown?

00:24:07,644 --> 00:24:09,579
7,800 in year 1...
Oh.

00:24:09,579 --> 00:24:11,214
10,000 in year 2,

00:24:11,214 --> 00:24:14,217
13,000, uh, in year 3,

00:24:14,217 --> 00:24:17,220
and I'm on track to, uh,
be around 13,000 this year.

00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,722
The numbers didn't add up
to me.

00:24:18,722 --> 00:24:20,724
You said that you sold
50,000 of these

00:24:20,724 --> 00:24:21,991
in the last three years.

00:24:21,991 --> 00:24:25,095
But then you said
you sold 13,000...
50,000--

00:24:25,095 --> 00:24:28,698
13,000 and 7,800.
Is that what you said?

00:24:28,698 --> 00:24:30,834
First year was, uh,
7,800, 10,000,

00:24:30,834 --> 00:24:33,603
13,000, and through today.

00:24:33,603 --> 00:24:35,805
My apologies.
So this year,
you gonna do 19,000?

00:24:35,805 --> 00:24:37,373
Pardon?
It's still not adding up.

00:24:37,373 --> 00:24:39,776
Yeah, 'cause This year, you
would have to do 19,000 units.

00:24:39,776 --> 00:24:42,545
'cause you came up
to 41,000 units.

00:24:42,545 --> 00:24:45,048
My apology--My--My--

00:24:45,048 --> 00:24:47,217
No, $31,000. You came up
to $31,000.
So, So, technically,

00:24:47,217 --> 00:24:49,219
what have you sold?
An engineer that comes
on national tv

00:24:49,219 --> 00:24:50,653
and can't do their math--
(Kevin) Oh...

00:24:50,653 --> 00:24:52,822
that's not good. (laughs)
(Robert) So what--

00:24:52,822 --> 00:24:55,525
my--My--My--That was--
That was--

00:24:55,525 --> 00:24:57,060
So what's the math, Dan?

00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,462
It--it--No. My apology.

00:24:59,462 --> 00:25:02,232
35,000 heading
towards 40,000.

00:25:02,232 --> 00:25:04,901
Dan, do you have a patent
on this?

00:25:04,901 --> 00:25:07,637
Yes, we actually have,
uh, three patents in total.

00:25:07,637 --> 00:25:09,506
Once we--
what is the chance
we could go

00:25:09,506 --> 00:25:12,776
to one of the largest companies
that makes tent supplies

00:25:12,776 --> 00:25:15,345
and say,
"listen, license my fly tent.

00:25:15,345 --> 00:25:17,046
Let's get in bed together"?

00:25:17,046 --> 00:25:19,449
the right deal, Kevin,
without a doubt,

00:25:19,449 --> 00:25:21,618
but I'd like to know
the marketing plan behind that.

00:25:21,618 --> 00:25:23,920
Well, I mean--
So, tell us specifically

00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,588
how you would use
the $50,000

00:25:25,588 --> 00:25:27,891
and how you think that'll
accelerate your sales?

00:25:27,891 --> 00:25:30,226
Mark, the $50,000
is well thought-out.

00:25:30,226 --> 00:25:31,761
I did
the national hardware show.

00:25:31,761 --> 00:25:34,497
I had two key reps
into qvc.

00:25:34,497 --> 00:25:36,933
Both of 'em
sent me contracts.

00:25:36,933 --> 00:25:38,968
All roads lead to Lori.

00:25:38,968 --> 00:25:43,139
So, $50,000 plus 50,000
that I have of inventory,

00:25:43,139 --> 00:25:45,809
plus getting that pipeline
ready for our qvc.

00:25:45,809 --> 00:25:47,811
We gotta keep pushing
This thing

00:25:47,811 --> 00:25:49,479
until the big buyer
box stores pull it

00:25:49,479 --> 00:25:51,481
because the consumer
wants it.

00:25:51,481 --> 00:25:53,883
Well, Dan, let's--Let's hear
what Lori has to say.

00:25:53,883 --> 00:25:55,718
So reps want to rep product.
Yes.

00:25:55,718 --> 00:25:57,086
So of course
they're going to anything

00:25:57,086 --> 00:25:58,555
that piques their interest,

00:25:58,555 --> 00:26:00,456
because they don't have
anything to lose.

00:26:00,456 --> 00:26:02,192
They can try,
get it on, see if it works.
Yes. Yes.

00:26:02,192 --> 00:26:03,793
You know, it's not their money.

00:26:03,793 --> 00:26:05,628
They didn't invest
in the product.
I agree.

00:26:05,628 --> 00:26:07,931
Dan, I-I--You know,
I'm just, uh,

00:26:07,931 --> 00:26:09,299
I'm just
a simple croatian guy.

00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:11,301
My mother would have died

00:26:11,301 --> 00:26:13,903
if I put my food
under a tent outside.

00:26:13,903 --> 00:26:17,941
So I'm just not buying
into the concept of...
okay.

00:26:17,941 --> 00:26:19,876
"Let's have a picnic
and put our food in the tent."
Yeah. (laughs)

00:26:19,876 --> 00:26:22,011

I think it's
an ingenious product.
Thank you.

00:26:27,283 --> 00:26:28,852
And I think
it's well engineered.

Some great things with it.

00:26:31,387 --> 00:26:33,523

add value to it.

I'll give you the $50,000,

How do we get our money back?

How do we get
our money back?

00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,795
Well, let me ask
a couple of questions.

00:28:18,795 --> 00:28:20,129
Why'd you name it dura-Tent?

00:28:20,129 --> 00:28:21,531
Shouldn't it be, like,
"fly be gone,"

00:28:21,531 --> 00:28:23,333
or "No more fly," or...

00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:27,170
dura-Tent. Dura platter.
Dura picnic items.

00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:30,006
I worked
with a marketing company.

00:28:30,006 --> 00:28:32,308
The person said,
"your name does not need

00:28:32,308 --> 00:28:34,677
"to describe the product
as much as the tagline

00:28:34,677 --> 00:28:35,979
needs to describe it."

00:28:35,979 --> 00:28:38,648
"dura-Tent," now you can
take the "tent" away

00:28:38,648 --> 00:28:41,084
and you can add on
accessories.

00:28:41,084 --> 00:28:42,552
(Robert) but it's not a tent.
If that's on a shelf,

00:28:42,552 --> 00:28:45,621
I could see people
walking right past it...
exactly.

00:28:45,621 --> 00:28:47,190
And not having any idea
what it was,

00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:49,392
because "Dura-Tent" doesn't mean
anything about covering food...

00:28:49,392 --> 00:28:50,994
and--
From flies.

00:28:50,994 --> 00:28:53,262
Usually I feel that, you know,
I can tell instantly

00:28:53,262 --> 00:28:54,964
if it's a hero or a zero.

00:28:54,964 --> 00:28:56,632
My problem here is,
I'm not sure there's

00:28:56,632 --> 00:28:58,735
this huge demand for it.

00:28:58,735 --> 00:29:01,604
And so actually,
for that reason, I'm out.

00:29:03,673 --> 00:29:06,075
(Kevin) Whoa, Dan.

00:29:06,075 --> 00:29:09,345
And I'm the only shark up here
that speaks fly.

00:29:09,345 --> 00:29:11,681
Daymond... I don't know
if you said...

00:29:11,681 --> 00:29:14,150
Well, Dan, um,
I was on the fence.

00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:16,319
So whether I like
to admit it or not,

00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:18,521
I probably learn more
from the sharks up here

00:29:18,521 --> 00:29:20,957
that are experts
in their field.

00:29:20,957 --> 00:29:24,594
I'm gonna have to learn
from Lori's decision here.

00:29:24,594 --> 00:29:25,995
I'm out.

00:29:27,263 --> 00:29:29,499
And, Lori, there's no way
to come back in?

00:29:29,499 --> 00:29:31,100
(Kevin) okay.
I'm sorry.

00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:35,638
Just to be clear, Dan,
you are turning down my offer?

00:29:35,638 --> 00:29:37,774
I don't think
he turned it down just yet.

00:29:37,774 --> 00:29:39,942
At this level, you know...

00:29:39,942 --> 00:29:42,345
obviously you'd hate
to turn down an offer,

00:29:42,345 --> 00:29:47,083
but money isn't my problem
right now.

00:29:48,518 --> 00:29:50,386
If we were to land
a big box store--

00:29:50,386 --> 00:29:52,021
You did--You didn't
come here for money?

00:29:53,689 --> 00:29:56,292
I... my goal was to take--

00:29:56,292 --> 00:29:59,862
to--to take a product from
inception into the marketplace.

00:29:59,862 --> 00:30:01,831
But that requires money.

00:30:01,831 --> 00:30:05,835
Exactly. But it also requires
the marketing side of this.

00:30:05,835 --> 00:30:08,237
But for you to give me
$50,000 and say,

00:30:08,237 --> 00:30:09,705
"just pay me back,"

00:30:09,705 --> 00:30:11,340
that doesn't get me
to the next level.

there's smart money,

00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:15,978
and there's dumb money,
and you're dumb money.

00:30:17,647 --> 00:30:19,015
I want to save lives.

00:30:19,015 --> 00:30:20,716
I want to save children.
I want to kill flies.

in Less than a year

00:31:44,734 --> 00:31:47,503
we've sold over $350,000 worth
of peanut butter.

00:31:47,503 --> 00:31:50,072
We have projected sales
of $1.2 million

00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,355
We've made about $20,000.

What happened
in the last seven days?

00:35:33,529 --> 00:35:35,898
I met a very nice lady,
and she gave me some contacts

00:35:35,898 --> 00:35:37,666
with some of
the children's flash sites,

00:35:37,666 --> 00:35:39,635
where they'll do like
a 24-Hour promotion

00:35:39,635 --> 00:35:41,103
on your brand.

00:35:41,103 --> 00:35:43,706
And everyone I reached out to,
um, was interested.

00:35:43,706 --> 00:35:45,508
This was never my dream.

00:35:45,508 --> 00:35:46,942
If you would have asked me
four years ago,

00:35:46,942 --> 00:35:48,944

This was a crazy idea.

00:35:48,944 --> 00:35:50,479

Absolutely.
So this is a styling aid.

00:35:56,152 --> 00:35:57,920
It's good for boys and girls,

00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,121
for people who are concerned
about using

00:35:59,121 --> 00:36:01,157
a hair product
on their baby.

00:36:02,324 --> 00:36:04,393
Oh, it smells good.

00:36:04,393 --> 00:36:05,928
My professional background

00:36:05,928 --> 00:36:08,931
I have a master's degree
in social work.

00:36:08,931 --> 00:36:10,800
(Robert) So you're not
a hair stylist?

00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,835
I'm not.

00:36:12,835 --> 00:36:14,036
The packaging, to me,
looks like

00:36:14,036 --> 00:36:16,372
something
that would be for an adult.

00:36:16,372 --> 00:36:19,341
I mean, it's very pretty, but it
doesn't say to me "children."

00:36:19,341 --> 00:36:21,977
I think it needs to say
that it's for children

00:36:21,977 --> 00:36:24,814
and that it's healthier,

00:36:24,814 --> 00:36:26,615
that it has
those safer elements to it.

00:36:26,615 --> 00:36:30,219
Are you opposed to changing
your packaging?

00:36:30,219 --> 00:36:32,588
Um, I don't think I would be
interested in changing it.

00:36:32,588 --> 00:36:34,423
Here's why.

00:36:34,423 --> 00:36:37,126
You know, we're not the only
children's line on the market.

00:36:37,126 --> 00:36:38,360
You're not.
I know that.

00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,062
Right.
But the other ones all had,

00:36:40,062 --> 00:36:42,198
like, cartoon-Looking
animals and children,

00:36:42,198 --> 00:36:44,033
and they smelled like fruit.

00:36:44,033 --> 00:36:46,602
Are they safer, too? Do they--
No.

00:36:46,602 --> 00:36:48,337
They're not? So there is
a distinct difference...

00:36:48,337 --> 00:36:50,105
absolutely.
Between yours and theirs?

00:36:50,105 --> 00:36:52,007

00:36:59,548 --> 00:37:01,283
So what type
of allergy testing

00:37:01,283 --> 00:37:02,618
have you done
with these products?

00:37:02,618 --> 00:37:05,187
Absolutely. My manufacturer
does a lot of, um,

00:37:05,187 --> 00:37:07,022
like, stability testing
and micro testing

00:37:07,022 --> 00:37:09,291
and things like that.
(Kevin) But do you have
the market size

00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:11,560
for children's products
like this,

00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,329
including
all your competitors?

00:37:13,329 --> 00:37:14,663
'cause that's what
I'm struggling with.

00:37:14,663 --> 00:37:16,098
How big a market is this?

00:37:16,098 --> 00:37:19,869
Well, there are 280,000
salons in America alone.

00:37:19,869 --> 00:37:21,237
The global baby care
market

00:37:21,237 --> 00:37:24,073

00:37:24,073 --> 00:37:26,342
by 5% in the next 5 years.
She's killing you, Kevin!

00:37:26,342 --> 00:37:27,910
Way to take it to him, Megan.
That's not the hair.

00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:30,045
(mark laughs)
You're talking about
all the products--

00:37:30,045 --> 00:37:32,181
That's okay.
What about
the baby hair products?

00:37:32,181 --> 00:37:33,749
Well, there's not
a lot of numbers on that,

00:37:33,749 --> 00:37:35,017
'cause it's new.

00:37:35,017 --> 00:37:36,218
I mean, it's just
kind of getting started.

00:37:36,218 --> 00:37:38,821
But with $20,000 in sales,

00:37:38,821 --> 00:37:40,489
why do you feel it could be
something huge?

00:37:40,489 --> 00:37:42,024
Uh, because people
get excited about it.

00:37:42,024 --> 00:37:43,359
They say, "Hey,
that's a good idea.

00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:44,593
Why didn't I think of that?"

00:37:44,593 --> 00:37:46,328

00:37:50,065 --> 00:37:51,300
It's amazing.

different media sources,

00:37:53,669 --> 00:37:56,705

to beauty blogs to magazines.

00:37:56,705 --> 00:37:58,440
You know, I--
So why haven't you
sold more, though?

00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,343
I mean, so you see--See why
we're seeing a disconnect here?

00:38:01,343 --> 00:38:02,945
Something's not adding up.

00:38:02,945 --> 00:38:05,014
I tell you, all the work
you've done,

00:38:05,014 --> 00:38:06,615
the way you present yourself,

00:38:06,615 --> 00:38:09,351
your vision for the product--
That's all on the good side.

00:38:09,351 --> 00:38:12,688
Where I really have
a problem is $20,000.

00:38:12,688 --> 00:38:15,658
It's speaking to me, saying,
"nobody cares."

00:38:18,561 --> 00:38:20,663
You know, I did
my first trade show,

00:38:20,663 --> 00:38:23,165
and I sat in Dallas,
and they said, "prepare,

00:38:23,165 --> 00:38:24,633
"because they're gonna
eat you for breakfast.

00:38:24,633 --> 00:38:26,735
They are not gonna be
receptive to this."

00:38:26,735 --> 00:38:28,070
And I thought, okay.

00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:29,738
But, like, I drug my family
across the country,

00:38:29,738 --> 00:38:31,140
and I'm not gonna make
a dime?

00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,542
And we were there,
and we sold $1,000 in 2 days.

00:38:33,542 --> 00:38:35,945
Which is nothing to you guys.
I know that.

00:38:35,945 --> 00:38:37,613
Um, but it was something
to me.

00:38:37,613 --> 00:38:40,015
I love every $1,000 equally.

00:38:40,015 --> 00:38:42,885
Have those folks reordered?
They have.

00:38:42,885 --> 00:38:45,754
My average wholesale markup
is 142%,

00:38:45,754 --> 00:38:49,158
and my average retail markup
is 284%.

00:38:49,158 --> 00:38:51,594
Um, as we make
more product...
great markup.

00:38:51,594 --> 00:38:52,895
Great markup.
We can get better margins.

00:38:52,895 --> 00:38:54,430
I have one--
(Lori) That's a great markup.

00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:56,632
Get better margins that that?
We can. Absolutely.

00:38:56,632 --> 00:38:58,067
Yeah. That's...
um, because my costs
to make these

00:38:58,067 --> 00:39:01,103
have come down considerably,
um, since we got started,

00:39:01,103 --> 00:39:02,504
because I'm learning things.

00:39:02,504 --> 00:39:04,907
So, Megan, you've created
maybe a new category.

00:39:04,907 --> 00:39:06,976
But $20,000 of sales

00:39:06,976 --> 00:39:10,145
in the hair care product
Industry is absolutely nothing.

00:39:10,145 --> 00:39:13,515
It's not even a rounding error.

00:39:13,515 --> 00:39:14,850
It's mist.

00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:17,953
I can't get over the Hurdle

00:39:17,953 --> 00:39:19,355
of whether This is
a business or not.

00:39:19,355 --> 00:39:21,991
I just don't know,
and neither do you.

00:39:21,991 --> 00:39:24,593
So for that reason, I'm out.

00:39:24,593 --> 00:39:27,930
Thank you, Kevin.
But I do know it's a business.

00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:29,398
I just wanted
to clarify that.

00:39:29,398 --> 00:39:31,433
I took a lot of heat
in the beginning

00:39:31,433 --> 00:39:33,836
because people would say,
"you're not a hair stylist.

00:39:33,836 --> 00:39:35,170
You're a social worker."

00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:37,706
And then I had the epiphany
that these products

00:39:37,706 --> 00:39:39,074
are not for hair stylists.

00:39:39,074 --> 00:39:41,677
Moms are gonna be the ones
to buy these products.

00:39:41,677 --> 00:39:43,746
And when it's important,
moms will listen.

00:39:43,746 --> 00:39:46,248
You know, I didn't do so well
in chemistry in college.

00:39:46,248 --> 00:39:48,517
I would be honest,
but when I learned about

00:39:48,517 --> 00:39:50,319
the toxins
in children's products

00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:51,787
and their effects
on a growing body,

00:39:51,787 --> 00:39:54,123
I learned--
Moms can figure this out.

00:39:54,123 --> 00:39:56,091
Then don't--don't you think
we have to take it further

00:39:56,091 --> 00:39:58,894
and actually test and label that
we've tested for these things?

00:39:58,894 --> 00:40:01,864
Because--
Absolutely, But those kind of
studies are very expensive.

00:40:01,864 --> 00:40:04,233
H-Have you priced them out
to know how much?

00:40:04,233 --> 00:40:06,902
I know an optical test
costs about $10,000.

00:40:06,902 --> 00:40:08,537
And if you look at my labeling,
we do not

00:40:08,537 --> 00:40:10,739
use the term "Tear-Free."
I cannot afford

00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:12,007
to use that term right now.

00:40:12,007 --> 00:40:13,742
I-I think
it needs to be branded

00:40:13,742 --> 00:40:17,446
a little bit more
towards children. Um...
sure.

00:40:17,446 --> 00:40:20,816
My heart is with you,
but my gut right now is,

00:40:20,816 --> 00:40:22,284
I feel there's a lot of work
to be done.

00:40:22,284 --> 00:40:24,219
Sure.
And for that reason,

00:40:24,219 --> 00:40:25,587
I'm out.

00:40:28,757 --> 00:40:30,959
(Mark) Megan,
I'll make it simple. I like it.

00:40:30,959 --> 00:40:32,728
And obviously, I have
a personal connection.

00:40:32,728 --> 00:40:34,663
I think $50,000
is not enough.

00:40:34,663 --> 00:40:36,365
And for me, the testing
is the most important,

00:40:36,365 --> 00:40:38,333
because if I can invest
in a product

00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:40,803
that makes my kid's life
a little bit better

00:40:40,803 --> 00:40:42,738
and opens a new market

00:40:42,738 --> 00:40:45,774
and has a chance to be
successful, that's a no-Brainer.

00:40:45,774 --> 00:40:47,309
So I want to make you
an offer.

00:40:48,811 --> 00:40:51,413
I want to offer you $75,000

00:40:51,413 --> 00:40:53,582
for 40% of the company.

00:40:59,722 --> 00:41:01,623
You know, we'll help you
get out there into salons.

00:41:01,623 --> 00:41:03,325
We'll help you get
into the kids' market.

00:41:03,325 --> 00:41:05,194
Sure.
So if that's something
you'd be interested in,

00:41:05,194 --> 00:41:07,062
I'd like to partner with you.

00:41:07,062 --> 00:41:08,630
Oh, my goodness, mark.
You know, I--

00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,265
out of respect
for everybody else,

00:41:10,265 --> 00:41:12,167
I'd like to hear what
anyone else has to say.

00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:14,336
No disrespect.
No disrespect taken.

00:41:14,336 --> 00:41:16,038
(Robert)
Wow, what a great answer.

00:41:16,038 --> 00:41:18,407
Megan, I'm sitting here
and--and I'm thinking,

00:41:18,407 --> 00:41:19,641
is it brilliant?

00:41:19,641 --> 00:41:22,611
Have you created
a brand-New category

00:41:22,611 --> 00:41:24,346
in hair salons?

00:41:24,346 --> 00:41:28,984
Or... is it gonna be
a really, really tough road?

00:41:28,984 --> 00:41:30,352
I don't know.

00:41:30,352 --> 00:41:32,087
I think mark's made you
a fantastic offer.

00:41:32,087 --> 00:41:34,690
Frankly, better than I--
I would have made.

00:41:35,691 --> 00:41:37,993
Uh... I'm out.

00:41:40,162 --> 00:41:43,432
So, a friend of mine
is Paul Mitchell.

00:41:43,432 --> 00:41:45,134
Mm-Hmm.
But I have to be honest.

00:41:45,134 --> 00:41:46,568
I think, uh, cuban is ready

00:41:46,568 --> 00:41:48,170
to take the ride with you
all the way.

00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:50,873
I wouldn't be
of any help to you

00:41:50,873 --> 00:41:53,208
if that one person I know
says, "beat it," all right?

00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:55,577
So I guess I'm out.

00:41:55,577 --> 00:41:58,747
Okay. Mark, I would love
to work with you.
(Kevin) Well, wait a sec.

00:41:58,747 --> 00:41:59,782
Wait a sec.
Wait--I was--

00:41:59,782 --> 00:42:00,949
there's no waiting.
Wait a second.

00:42:00,949 --> 00:42:03,118
That's it.
Shake her hand.

00:42:03,118 --> 00:42:04,520
Thank you, mark.
Wow.

00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,621
I'm so excited.

00:42:05,621 --> 00:42:07,456
Thanks, Megan.
Thank you guys so much.

00:42:07,456 --> 00:42:09,124
I really appreciate it.
Fantastic presentation.

00:42:09,124 --> 00:42:10,826
(Daymond) Good luck.
Good luck.
Thank you, guys.

00:42:10,826 --> 00:42:12,895
(Robert) Fantastic.
(Kevin) That's interesting.

00:42:12,895 --> 00:42:14,696
I mean, either she's got
a category killer,

00:42:14,696 --> 00:42:16,365
or there isn't a category.

00:42:16,365 --> 00:42:18,433
That's okay. My kids will use
all the lotion that's left then.

00:42:18,433 --> 00:42:19,768
(laughter)

00:42:19,768 --> 00:42:21,436
This means everything.

00:42:21,436 --> 00:42:23,839
It means that
I can make a product...

00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,507
(voice breaking)
and it's not gonna take

00:42:25,507 --> 00:42:27,609
the last 10 cents
out of my bank account.

00:42:27,609 --> 00:42:30,612
Like, it's amazing. (crying)

00:42:30,612 --> 00:42:33,682
(whispers) It's amazing.
