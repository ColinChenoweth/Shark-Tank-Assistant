00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:02,235
(man) the sharks are back

00:00:02,235 --> 00:00:04,237
in an all-New season
of "Shark tank,"

00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:06,840
where Hopeful entrepreneurs
from across the country

00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,576
dream of a chance
to secure an investment

00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:11,644
and gain powerful partners

00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:15,382
to start, grow,
or save their businesses.

00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:17,117
I want to make it
so that people believe

00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:19,252
that America can make products
that are great.

00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:20,587
If the sharks
hear a great idea,

00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:24,591
they're ready to invest
using their own money.

00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:25,992
How would I get
my money back?

00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:27,193
I will write you a check.

00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:28,461
(laughter)

00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:31,197
And they'll fight each other
for a piece of the action.

00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,333
You're hurting children.
Are you kidding me?

00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,301
We're not here to suck
the blood out of companies.
At what point

00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:37,303
do you ever
get your money back?

00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:39,973
But first, the entrepreneurs
must convince a shark

00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:41,908
to invest the full amount
they're asking for,

00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:43,576
or they'll walk away
with nothing.

00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:45,979
I don't wanna tell you
how to do this business,

00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,380
I want to support you.

00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,115
It's sink...
money's binary.

00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:49,916
Either you make it,
or you lose it.

00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,918
Or swim.
I know what has to be done.

00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:53,787
When? When? When?
Right now.

00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:59,325
Who are the sharks?

00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:03,063
They're self-Made millionaire
and billionaire investors

00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,597
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.

00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:08,835
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist

00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:12,172
who turned a $10,000 loan
into a software business

00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:17,177
worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:19,179
Barbara Corcoran

00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:20,180

preeminent real estate empire.

a better version

of something all babies need.

00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,663
♪♪

00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:13,066
Hi, sharks.
My name is Susie Taylor,

00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,167
and this is my husband.

00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:16,302
Hi, sharks.
My name is Steve Taylor.

00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:19,172
Our company is bibbitec,

00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:21,975
and we're here today
seeking $40,000

00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,978
for a 14% stake
in our company.

00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,514
As a parent
of two messy little boys,

00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:30,717
we often found ourselves
in messy situations.

00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:33,319
And what drove me insane

00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,854
was Susie spending
our hard-Earned money

00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:37,390
on bibs that just
didn't work.

00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,525
So I pleaded with her,

00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:41,861
"Susie, if they don't work,
please, don't buy them."

00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:42,662
(laughs)
(laughs) okay.

00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,331
So I stopped buying them,

00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,434
and I decided
to solve the problem myself.

00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:50,236
Introducing...

00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:51,638
♪ ta-Da ♪
bibbitec.

00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,239
The best thing
about the bibbitec bib

00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:54,774
is the design.

00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:56,776
It simply fits
over the child's arm

00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:59,112
and slips over their head

00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,781
and comfortably covers
their entire body.

00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:03,650
(Susie) What's great about
this american-Made,

00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,518
nontoxic fabric

00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,519
is that it never stains,

00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,054
never smells,

00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:09,656
and never holds an odor.

00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,261
It's too good to be True,
I know.

00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:16,596
You wanna give 'em
a closer look?

00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:17,864
Take a closer look, sharks?
Yeah.

00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,265
I was hoping to see
the dirty one.

00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:20,266
Could we have a look
at the dirty one?

00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:21,034
(Steve) sure.
Oh, sure.

00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,169
Susie, it didn't leave
a stain or anything on it?

00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:23,570
It's just a little bit
of moisture from the wipe,

00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,571
and it's gonna dry
with the air.

00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,306
It's like fitness material.

00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:27,974
Is this neoprene?

00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:30,910
It's a poly-Nylon blend.
It's patented.

00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,313
It's nontoxic certified.

00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,248
It's comfortable.
The kids love to wear it.

00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:37,116
What do you sell it for?

00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,985
We are selling it right now,
direct to consumer,

00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:42,255
on our web site, for $24.99.

00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:43,056
What does it cost you
to make it?

00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,791
Currently, our price
is $15 per bib.

00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,260
Oh! Oh.

00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,195
Oh, that's crazy.
Whoa.

00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:50,730
That's brutal.
Holy cow!

00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,767
But it is also selling
in catalogs online for $48.

00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:56,569
Why is it $15 to make it?

00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,571
Because This is
the Mack daddy material.

00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:03,042
You can't make money
selling bibs to America

00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:04,911
at a really high price.

00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,046
It's cheaper to just
buy a bunch of bibs,

00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:08,381
and throw them out
after they get dirty.

00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:10,116
Absolutely not,
Mr. Wonderful.

00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:11,251
This is one bib
that will last you

00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,852
four years, even longer.

00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:16,055
Once you look at what mothers
are buying on bibs...

00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:18,591
what they're spending
a year--$400.

00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,926
No. No way.
(Barbara) No way.

00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,861
I will--
No way, Susie.

00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,463
Okay, you don't notice it,

00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,465
but you will throw away more
bibs than you can ever imagine.

00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:26,733
How many have you sold?

00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:27,700
We've sold about 2,000.

00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,435
Over the four years?

00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,169
Yes. Little under
four years.

00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,972
What did you sell
in the last 12 months?

00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:33,973
In the last 12 months,

00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:36,643
uh, we are
at about 17,000,

00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,444
uh, dollars in sales.

00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:38,511
That's it?

00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:43,449
The majority of bibs
are not bought online, guys.

00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,717
Let's face it, okay?
Mm-hmm.

00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:45,985
Millions of bibs
go out every year.

00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:48,655
There's two or three
large-Box retailers

00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,590
that sell baby apparel
like this.

00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,525
Why are you not in retail?

00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,527
Can I tell you why?
Yes, please do.

00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:56,663
Okay. They said
it's a hard sell

00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,464
because it's an education.

00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:01,134
I have to explain
this bib actually works.

00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:01,901
Ah.
Right.

00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:05,305
They confirmed
that their bibs are bait.

00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,373
They're used to get
the mom into the store

00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:08,308
to buy the bib,

00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,176
and the orange juice
and everything else...
But, Susie,

00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:10,843
honey, sweetie, poopsie,

00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:12,512
that's what I'm talking about.
I know, and--

00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,180
It's too expensive.
No, it's not.

00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,783
We have found that it has sold
at $48 without a question.

00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,185
People are... I'm not...
$48? Insane.

00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,587
It's ins--I could get
a whole outfit.
Of course. That's why
I pulled out of it.

00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:22,855
And I feel retail
is obnoxious.

00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:26,192
Susie, it's a Hobby.
It's not a business.

00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:28,261
Well...
the numbers,

00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,796
well, it start--
they're talking,
I'm listening.

00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:30,997
Okay.
They're saying,
"Mr. Wonderful,

00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,199
we're not selling very many,
cause they're too expensive."

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,035
I disagree. We have sold them
for all different prices.

00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:38,438
The price is...
it really wasn't an issue.

00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:41,107
The education of the product
is the issue.

00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:44,577
I have no business experience.
I need you guys to blow me up.

00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:45,845
Here's my challenge--

00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,113
I actually think
it's a great product.

00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:47,580
Thank you very much.

00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,649
Instead of trying to sell it,

00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:50,650
have you tried licensing it
to somebody

00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,518
who already makes bibs?

00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,720
Well, when I went
to the big box stores,

00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,322
they all wanted me to go
to--to China.

00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:57,457
They wanted me
to drag it down.

00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:57,857
They wanted to sell it
for $19.99.

00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,526
For me, the stuff
that I bought from China,

00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,728
the toxins
that my kids were sucking on,

00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,796
I couldn't morally do that.

00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:06,199
I want to make it
so that people believe

00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,835
that America can make products
that are great for our kids.

00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,303
America can make products,

00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:13,039
but your cost is keeping this
away from America.

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,040
But we're making
a mark--
You're hurting children

00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,644
that don't get near it
because they can't afford it.

00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:21,381
Well, our margins are large.

00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,849
No. No. They're horrible.
They're terrible.
Margins are terrible.

00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:23,516
Susie, you're making 'em
for $15,

00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:26,252
you're selling 'em
for $24 on your web site.

00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:28,187
Well...
How is that a good margin?

00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,591
Robert, if I may,

00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,726
whenever we get in front
of moms at trade shows...
it just...

00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,596
if flies out.
When they see it...
and people flock around...

00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:37,730
it flies out.
And they freak out.

00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,866
Because they are
starting to realize

00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,167
that they're buying stuff
from China, and it's breaking.

00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,769
Are you making
any money doing this?

00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,704
No.

00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:45,571
We've invested over--
at the end of the four years,

00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,106
about $75,000.

00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:48,441
And you haven't made
any return

00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,575
on that investment yet?
No.

00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,711
What we feel
the value of our company is--

00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,045
that we've been
out there to mothers,

00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:54,580
we know
they love the product.

00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,649
Steve, how long are you
going to lose money

00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:59,385
every month doing this?

00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:01,454
(sighs)

00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:04,123
If we don't get
an investor,

00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:05,725
I have a certain amount of money
I'm gonna put in,

00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:06,993
that I'm willing
to put in.

00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:08,728
How much more money
will you put in?

00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:09,662
I think--
That we can afford,
personally?

00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,597
We can't.
We can't afford any more.

00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,966
So, Susie,
is it time to take the bib

00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:16,969
behind the barn
and shoot it?

00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:19,439

00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:35,504
Absolutely not.

00:07:35,504 --> 00:07:38,200
Can you get the price
of this bib down in America?

00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,203
Yes. No question.
I think we can. If we have
a large order, we can.

00:07:41,203 --> 00:07:43,004
Daymond, you gotta
make it for 2 bucks,

00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,406
like every other bib's
made for.

00:07:44,406 --> 00:07:46,808
What is the magic price point
to sell it at, retail-Wise?

00:07:46,808 --> 00:07:49,177
We feel this one
can sell for $19.99.

00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,979
We feel the larger one,
we feel a good price point

00:07:50,979 --> 00:07:54,316
is either $24.99
or $29.99.
(daymond) Okay--

00:07:54,316 --> 00:07:54,516
This is the first bib
they look at.

00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:57,052
All right. So the $19.99 one

00:07:57,052 --> 00:07:59,788
you have to manufacture
for $5.

00:07:59,788 --> 00:08:01,523
(Kevin) That'll never happen.

00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:03,058
We'd--We'd have to...
I...

00:08:03,058 --> 00:08:05,193
get a different,
uh, material,

00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,328
and we're open
for that.
(sighs heavily)

00:08:06,328 --> 00:08:07,996
Steve, that's not
your problem.

00:08:07,996 --> 00:08:12,734
Your problem is,
how do you sell many thousands?

00:08:12,734 --> 00:08:14,803
And I don't think
you're doing a good job today

00:08:14,803 --> 00:08:16,471
of explaining that.

00:08:16,471 --> 00:08:18,673
'cause it's
too expensive, Robert.

00:08:18,673 --> 00:08:20,275
Okay, well, let me ask you.

00:08:20,275 --> 00:08:22,077
Susie, are you not
selling thousands

00:08:22,077 --> 00:08:23,912
because it's too expensive?

00:08:23,912 --> 00:08:25,313
No, I'm not
selling thousands--
So why are you not
selling thousands?

00:08:25,313 --> 00:08:28,250
Because I'm just--
I'm a mom. My kids come first.

00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,052
Sorry, Susie.
You're not selling more

00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:31,453
because you're a mom?

00:08:31,453 --> 00:08:33,922
No! Because
I don't have more time.

00:08:33,922 --> 00:08:35,056
I'm just myself.
(lowered voice)
Deep breath. Deep breath.

00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,525
We haven't gotten the message
out to all the mothers.

00:08:36,525 --> 00:08:38,527
Susie, you've been
doing it for four years.

00:08:39,661 --> 00:08:41,596
Susie, why are you
getting emotional

00:08:41,596 --> 00:08:43,131
about this right now?

00:08:43,131 --> 00:08:46,201
I'm a stay-at-Home mom,
trying to do my best,

00:08:46,201 --> 00:08:47,669
really trying
to raise the kids

00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:48,804
the way I was
"supposed" to raise the kids.

00:08:48,804 --> 00:08:52,274
And Stephen was trying
to run a business.

00:08:52,274 --> 00:08:53,875
And we would have
these fights over finances.

00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,178
And one day,
we're on a-a road trip,

00:08:56,178 --> 00:08:57,779
and he's asking about
the credit card bills.

00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:59,514
And I'm trying
to explain to him

00:08:59,514 --> 00:09:01,383
what the things are
that we need.

00:09:01,383 --> 00:09:02,784
And there were a lot of bibs.

00:09:02,784 --> 00:09:05,787
I know it's crazy,
but there were a lot of bibs.

00:09:05,787 --> 00:09:06,588
And he's like, "where are they?"

00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:07,589
and I'm like,
"They're in the garbage."

00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,925
He's like, "suse,

00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:10,459
that's hard-Earned money
you're throwing away."
(pats hands)

00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:12,661
I'm like,
"But they don't work."

00:09:12,661 --> 00:09:15,130
And I feel like it's--It's
like an endless pit of moms.

00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,798
We're sitting here
trying to do our best

00:09:16,798 --> 00:09:17,999
with products
that aren't working,

00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:19,468
and that's where
the passion comes from.

00:09:19,468 --> 00:09:22,671
I'm--I'm heartbroken.

00:09:22,671 --> 00:09:24,806
Do you think
we're not astute investors?

00:09:24,806 --> 00:09:28,143
W--Wait a second.
We're looking at it
from the side that matters--

00:09:28,143 --> 00:09:30,245
the money.
You're not making any.

00:09:30,245 --> 00:09:33,248
You're losing your family's
money every month.

00:09:33,248 --> 00:09:34,115
Do you think
any investor up here

00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,518
wants to join you
in that madness?

00:09:36,518 --> 00:09:37,786
We don't have
your connections.

00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,521
Money's binary--Either you
make it, or you lose it.

00:09:39,521 --> 00:09:40,989
There's a tipping point,
okay?
We are at
that tipping point.

00:09:40,989 --> 00:09:43,258
To say that
we haven't made money...

00:09:43,258 --> 00:09:45,126
and my question be--
has been...
it's not fair
to say we'll never make it.

00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,728
When? When? When?
Right now!

00:09:46,728 --> 00:09:48,930
Okay. Guys, guys, guys,
guys, guys, guys.
With one of you,
or all of you.

00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,265
There's no point.
It's like--
right.

00:09:50,265 --> 00:09:53,668
It's like arguing with--
With... a wall.

00:09:53,668 --> 00:09:54,736
Here's my perspective--

00:09:54,736 --> 00:09:57,005
I like the product.
Thank you.

00:09:57,005 --> 00:09:58,673
I don't think
you need to sell it retail.

00:09:58,673 --> 00:10:00,876
I don't have a problem
with the price point.

00:10:00,876 --> 00:10:03,979
Thank you.
I think there's
a large enough market there.

00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:06,181
What I do have
a problem with is,

00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:08,250
you're not
the right person to run it.

00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,852
You're the exact
wrong person to run it.

00:10:10,852 --> 00:10:13,588
Go find a college kid
who knows internet marketing,

00:10:13,588 --> 00:10:16,725
and takes it out to all
the different moms' groups.

00:10:16,725 --> 00:10:20,595
Cost you $25,000, $30,000
for that person to do it.

00:10:20,595 --> 00:10:23,331
It's not about connections.

00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:26,735
I'm not the right solution.
It's out there for you.

00:10:26,735 --> 00:10:28,203
I wish you the best,
but I'm out.

00:10:31,066 --> 00:10:33,934
Um, I agree
with mark's very good idea,

00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:35,035
and that's easily done.

00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:36,103
But I also think you have

00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:39,172
a ready-Made
mom sales force out there.

00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:42,442
I think you could get
a legion of moms

00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:44,911
believing as fervently
as you do in the product,

00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,313
which is so obvious.

00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,982
And I think you could
very inexpensively

00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,984
get your product out there
where it belongs,

00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,452
and I don't think
it's retail.

00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:54,187
That's a great idea.
Thank you. Thank you.

They are giving you

encouragement where there's
none, and I'm disgusted.

00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:09,569
I'm out.

00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,576
Daymond, Robert, any...

00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:18,111
the challenge
I'm having here is that

00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:21,515
in most businesses,

00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:24,318
the problem
is the education.

00:11:24,318 --> 00:11:26,586
I can't help you
educate people about bibs.

00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:29,990
I'm out.

00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,930
I hear a lot
of confusing strategies

00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,599
on how to sell it.

00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:40,467
What I've learned is,

00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:43,704
you gotta follow the money.

00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:46,039
I don't think
you have a clear plan

00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,508
on how to make this successful.

00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:49,509
I'm out.

00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:51,558
the soundbender.

00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,894

00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:59,699
Magnetic, power-Free
amplifier for your ipad.

00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:02,736
It clips right on
to the back magnetically,

00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:06,339
beautifully reflecting
the sound right towards you--

00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:09,009
Boom--Just like that,
in a snap.
Wow.

00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:10,544
All right, check this out.

00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,681
(laughs)
(Robert) Oy.

00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:15,882
♪♪

00:15:15,882 --> 00:15:18,285
(volume increases)
Oh, wow.

00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:20,754
Stop the madness.
It's magical.

00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:22,489
It makes a real difference.

00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:24,958
It really does.
It's awesome.

00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:27,761
This little baby--

00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:30,430
Not only does it offer
huge sound,

00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:34,100
it also offers huge margins.

00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,336
Hey, come on.
Rabbis gotta eat, too, right?

00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:38,471
(laughs)

00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:41,474
Moshe, very good presentation.
Very easy to understand.

00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:43,677
Tell us about
those succulent margins

00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:44,411
you made reference to.

00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:47,414
Um, what would you
like to know?

00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:49,082
What are they?
I'd like to know
the numbers.

00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:52,018
Well, it costs right now,
without packaging, a dollar.

00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:53,219
Including the magnets?

00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:54,888
Including the magnets,
my friend.

00:15:54,888 --> 00:15:57,357
Okay, and how much
are you selling it for?

00:15:57,357 --> 00:16:00,427
$12.99 retail--Manufacturer's
suggested retail price.

00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:01,294
$12.99?
Ooh, rabbi.

00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,295
$12.99, baby.

00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,297
A higher power is involved.

00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,433
Moshe, are you
selling it today?
I am.

00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,034
Do you have sales?
I do have sales.

00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:09,269
I've sold 7,000 units
to date.

00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:11,404
I've only been selling it
for about six months.

00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:13,807
Where are you selling it?
How? Online?

00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:14,941
I'm selling them online,

00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:17,811
and actually, um,
to a wholesale online...

00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,879
do you have those
for us to look at?
Yes, I do.

00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:20,146
I have several of them.

00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,549
Which color would you like?
I have pink...

00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:23,283
Oh, colors.
White, for sure.

00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:25,352
(Robert) Oh.
White?

00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:27,220
I'm gonna take red and black.
Stop and go.
Okay.

00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,221
And I have more, so...

00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:29,756
thank you, sir.
Appreciate it.

00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:32,025
It's cool. All right.
Thank you.

00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:33,493
Moshe, I gotta know--

00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:34,361
How did you come up
with the idea?

00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:36,229
Oh, man, I'm a teacher,
a rabbi,

00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:38,565
at a-a jewish high school
for--for boys

00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:41,501
out in minnesota,
and we had to close it down.

00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,470
You know, the recession just
literally destroyed us.

00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:48,008
And somebody gave me
an ipad as a gift,

00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,476
to lift my spirits.

00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:51,211
So I started using it
at night,

00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:53,813
and I kept cupping
my hand behind it,

00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:55,148
and then I just...
it was like...

00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:58,151
it was like--It was like a light
at the end of the tunnel.

00:16:58,151 --> 00:17:01,087
And within a week,
I had prototypes.

00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:02,489
I-I've been working

00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:04,824
with the same manufacturer
in minnesota.

00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:06,693
Made in the U.S.A.

00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,895
And the margins
are still amazing.

00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:11,564
It's just been
a really great experience.

00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:15,468
I really--I'm here today
to ask for your help

00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:17,337
because I'm willing
to work hard.

00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:20,407
What do you want
the $54,000 for?

00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:21,875
What are you
gonna do with it?

00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:26,012
I am going to modify
the mold one more time.

00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:26,746
Why? It works great
right now.

00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:28,014
It does, but I want it
to work better.

00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:29,215
Are you the kind of guy

00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,618
that wants to keep tinkering
and not sell?

00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:33,553
No, absolutely not.
I want to sell and...

00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,155
make it better
so we can sell more.

00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:37,157
Sometimes people
have that disease,

00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:39,826
they never stop
trying to make it better.
Yeah, I don't have
that disease.

00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:41,027
I'll tell you what--

00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:45,031
I have, um, very,
very high interest

00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:48,201
from a very large
retail chain.

00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:49,335
Um...
who is it?

00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:51,071
Walgreens.

00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,939
Walgreens?
Yeah.

00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:57,544
Rabbi, would you be against
licensing your idea

00:17:57,544 --> 00:17:59,946
to somebody that could get
overnight distribution

00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:01,614
to millions of outlets,
millions of units,

00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:05,018
drive your production cost
down to pennies?

00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:06,286
I mean, I look
at the accessories market.

00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:09,355
It's a $2 billion business.
It's huge.

00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:12,225
It's huge.
But it's not made
in kitchen tables.

00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:13,293
It's hundreds
of thousands of units

00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:15,095
pounded out of a mold
in Asia.

00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:18,164
To me, the opportunity here
is to try and convince somebody

00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:20,500
to give you 4 cents a unit,

00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,835
just in a royalty,
and run with it.

00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:23,470
That, to me,
is the way I would do it.

00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,805
But I don't think
I sense that from you.

00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:26,339
I'll tell you
very straightforward,

00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:29,342
I am not going to license it out
for 4 cents apiece

00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:31,211
and bang 'em out
in China.
Okay, rabbi,

00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:32,946
I'm out.

00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:35,615
I respect that.
Thank you very much.

00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,751
There's four other sharks.

00:18:37,751 --> 00:18:38,752
Let's negotiate, people.

00:18:38,752 --> 00:18:40,553
Let's get this done.

00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:44,891
Rabbi, I-I think you've got
a nice little business here.

00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:45,892
You've got the chutzpah.
(giggles)

00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:49,896
but I've gotta make
the determination of my time,

00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:51,965
right,
which is very valuable.

00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,500
If I saw a way to get this

00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,536
to a $20 million-In-Sales
business,

00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:57,470
then it's worth--

00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,940
I-I just don't see it getting
that big. I really don't.

00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,275
So for that reason, I'm out.

00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:05,612
I appreciate it.
Thank you.

00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:07,747
How would I get
my money back

00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:09,682
if I gave you
the money for this product?

00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:11,818
I will write you a check.

00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:12,819
When?

00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,555
(laughter)

00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:17,690
That's a start.
It couldn't be simpler
than that, Barbara.

00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,759
I'm suggesting a guarantee

00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,295
that I get my money back
as you sell.

00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:25,632
So you want a royalty?
Well, sort of a royalty, yeah.

00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:27,367
I-I think that might be
counterproductive

00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:28,802
to what I'm trying
to do.

00:19:28,802 --> 00:19:30,136
Why?
So that's off the table?

00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:31,805
Because it's
siphoning off cash

00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:32,272
while we're
growing the business.

00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:34,808
Don't you think

00:19:34,808 --> 00:19:35,275
that it would make sense--
No, I don't think
that's a problem.

00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:37,477
Well done.
Well done, rabbi.

00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:38,945
Okay. I'm out.

00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:47,086
(daymond) I can't negotiate
lower money.

00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:48,688
So what do you think we need
to negotiate here?

00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:52,759
Obviously, you would like
to possibly negotiate

00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:53,827
the percentage
of the company?

00:19:53,827 --> 00:19:55,895
A-Cha.

00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:57,363
How much of the company

00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:01,634
would you be willing
to be okay with

00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:03,269
for the $54,000,
sticking at that?

00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:06,272
I would be happy
with 40%.

00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:13,346
The only thing
that is out there

00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:17,750
that's making me want
to invest in this company

00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,953
is the walgreens sale.

00:20:19,953 --> 00:20:21,287
Here's my offer,
to clarify--

00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:23,556
$54,000, 40%,

00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,693
and it has to be that
that walgreens sale

00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:28,161
is a real deal.
Okay.

00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:29,696
That's my offer.

00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:32,031
(exhales) Um, Robert?

00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:33,032
Would you like to...

00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:34,033
you know, Moshe,

00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:36,135
you're one of the best
entrepreneurs we've had here.

00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:39,606
I mean, you gave us the best
answer anybody's ever given

00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:42,208
when we asked
for this royalty stuff.

00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,077
Doesn't mean
it's the right answer.

00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:44,944
It's the right answer.
No, it isn't.

00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:46,946
We're not here to suck
the blood out of companies.

00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:48,948
At what point do you
ever get your money back?

00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:53,486
Moshe, I gave you an offer.

00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:56,022
If we're gonna listen
to them too much longer...

00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:57,156
right.
'cause you understand,
if he steps out...

00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:58,892
right.

00:20:58,892 --> 00:21:01,227
My offer starts to change,
because I become more valuable.

00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:03,763
Uh, are you going
to make an offer, Robert?

00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:04,764
I-I hate to...

00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:10,336
♪♪

00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:18,433

00:21:18,433 --> 00:21:20,035
three sharks are out.

00:21:20,035 --> 00:21:22,838
Rabbi Moshe has an offer
on the table from daymond,

00:21:22,838 --> 00:21:26,708
and Robert is still
considering the investment.

00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:29,845
Moshe, I gave you an offer.

00:21:29,845 --> 00:21:31,647
Yes.
If we're gonna listen
to them too much longer...

00:21:31,647 --> 00:21:33,982
right.
'cause you understand,
if he steps out...

00:21:33,982 --> 00:21:35,384

My offer starts to change,

00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,768
Are you going
to make an offer, Robert?

00:21:39,768 --> 00:21:40,436
I-I hate to...

00:21:40,436 --> 00:21:42,905
here's the good--

00:21:42,905 --> 00:21:44,607
I love the reason
you started this business.

00:21:44,607 --> 00:21:46,208
I think you're highly motivated,

00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:48,077
I think you did
a fantastic presentation.

00:21:48,077 --> 00:21:49,945
Let's do it.

00:21:49,945 --> 00:21:51,413
Here's the bad...
(laughs)

00:21:51,413 --> 00:21:54,016
Beyond the presentation,

00:21:54,016 --> 00:21:56,485
you didn't really tell us
how we're gonna sell it.

00:21:56,485 --> 00:21:58,554
You didn't talk about
the distribution channel.

00:21:58,554 --> 00:22:01,490
My biggest fear is,
as mark said, is my time.

00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:04,226
I don't wanna tell you
how to do this business.

00:22:04,226 --> 00:22:06,161
I want to support you.

00:22:06,161 --> 00:22:07,363
I know
what has to be done.

00:22:07,363 --> 00:22:09,765
I'm not sitting
on my hands going,

00:22:09,765 --> 00:22:11,433

00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:27,082
I need your connections.
That's what I need.

00:22:28,417 --> 00:22:31,553
I'd like to make an offer.
Okay.

00:22:31,553 --> 00:22:33,622
I'd like to hear
your answer on Daymond's offer.

00:22:33,622 --> 00:22:36,358
I'm gonna give you
ten seconds to think about it.

00:22:36,358 --> 00:22:37,226
After that, I'm dropping out.

00:22:37,226 --> 00:22:41,764
I'll give you the $54,000.

00:22:41,764 --> 00:22:42,831
Same amount. 40%.

00:22:42,831 --> 00:22:44,700
I'm gonna take you at your word

00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,901

Both offers are for
the same amount of equity, 40%,

00:22:52,408 --> 00:22:56,545
for the same amount
of dollars--$54,000.

00:22:56,545 --> 00:22:59,548
One has a contingency,
the other doesn't.

00:23:01,016 --> 00:23:02,217
What are you going
to do?

00:23:11,093 --> 00:23:13,562

My--My only pet peeve,
I'll tell you,

00:28:36,585 --> 00:28:39,655
is I-I hate when people

When they're starting
a start-up.

00:28:42,057 --> 00:28:44,059
That--That's your cost.
That's an opportunity cost...

00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:45,928
Absolutely. Yeah.
Not my cost.

00:28:45,928 --> 00:28:46,328

I'm not asking you to--

00:28:46,328 --> 00:28:48,997
I'm not asking you
to pay me for that time.

00:28:48,997 --> 00:28:49,932
But you did say--
You did say--
I'm just asking you
to recognize

00:28:49,932 --> 00:28:51,400
that that's the value
of the business.

00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,601
So you--You've put
a $2 million valuation

00:28:52,601 --> 00:28:54,536
on this business
right now.
Yes.

00:28:54,536 --> 00:28:57,272
Are you saying you've got
sales to support that,

00:28:57,272 --> 00:28:59,041
or just your time?

00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:00,442
If you don't mind,
I'd like to come back to that.

00:29:00,442 --> 00:29:01,777
Well, generally, that means
you have no sales.
(Robert chuckles)

00:29:01,777 --> 00:29:03,712

First I'd like you
to understand--

Mike, when somebody doesn't
answer the sales question,

00:29:05,647 --> 00:29:07,649

00:29:07,649 --> 00:29:09,585
Well, let me ask you this--

00:29:09,585 --> 00:29:12,187
So we launched this thing,
did no marketing,

00:29:12,187 --> 00:29:14,456
and then 32,000 people
have been to the site.

00:29:14,456 --> 00:29:17,259
How many units
do you think we would have sold?

00:29:17,259 --> 00:29:19,861
I would think 5% of them
would have bought it.

00:29:19,861 --> 00:29:22,064
Yeah. It's 9 1/2%.

00:29:22,064 --> 00:29:24,333
Over 3,000 units sold.
Ooh.

00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:26,001
It's brought in
about $90,000.

00:29:26,001 --> 00:29:29,071
Has that been consistent
every month, 9% conversion?

00:29:29,071 --> 00:29:31,239
It depends on where
the traffic comes from.

00:29:31,239 --> 00:29:34,710
So a good deal of that
has come from deals

00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,511
that we've run
with livingsocial and groupon,

00:29:36,511 --> 00:29:38,580
where we didn't
have to pay any marketing...
Oh, that--Okay,
that just kills

00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,048
the whole
conversion percentage.
(daymond) Yeah.

00:29:40,048 --> 00:29:42,117
That's just
a discount mechanism,

00:29:42,117 --> 00:29:43,452
and they do
all the promoting.

00:29:43,452 --> 00:29:45,187
It's not your site
doing the promoting.

00:29:45,187 --> 00:29:46,388
Right. Well, that's the point,

00:29:46,388 --> 00:29:47,990
is that somebody else
went out there

00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:50,792
and spent their money
to tell somebody about this

00:29:50,792 --> 00:29:52,928
and present them
with an offer.
But this is what they do.
Groupon--

00:29:52,928 --> 00:29:54,663
That's what they do.
They do that to everybody.
It's their job.

00:29:54,663 --> 00:29:56,064
They... right.

00:29:56,064 --> 00:29:57,532
What did you make per bear
on a groupon deal?

00:29:57,532 --> 00:30:00,936
We're only at about
20% margin on that.
And you gave them
a discount?

00:30:00,936 --> 00:30:03,071
Yes, the consumer
gets a discount.
What did you present
the retail as,

00:30:03,071 --> 00:30:06,041
what did you sell it
through the deal company,

00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:07,242
and what are your costs
for this?

00:30:07,242 --> 00:30:09,378
The--the bear itself
is $39.95.

00:30:09,378 --> 00:30:10,712
That's the retail price?
Yes.

00:30:10,712 --> 00:30:12,714
And then people pay
an EXTRA 20 bucks

00:30:12,714 --> 00:30:14,182
for personalized music

00:30:14,182 --> 00:30:16,051
and a year of unlimited
recording and downloads.

00:30:16,051 --> 00:30:17,386
So the bundle is 60 bucks.

00:30:17,386 --> 00:30:21,657
How much did groupon
and livingsocial sell it for

00:30:21,657 --> 00:30:22,658
to their customers?
Their usual, half off.

00:30:22,658 --> 00:30:24,860
If you just
kept that model,

00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,927
you wouldn't have
a sustainable business,

00:30:25,927 --> 00:30:27,863
because your margins
are only 20%.

00:30:27,863 --> 00:30:29,331
Right, but of course, I'm not
gonna keep that model.

00:30:29,331 --> 00:30:33,335
Mike, when I was a kid,
we had ten kids in our family,

00:30:33,335 --> 00:30:36,805
so my dad sang and played
the guitar to us every night.

00:30:36,805 --> 00:30:39,107
Right.
And he came up
with the genius idea

00:30:39,107 --> 00:30:42,177
of recording his voice
and all of his songs.
Yeah.

00:30:42,177 --> 00:30:45,847
We all had
a funny reaction to it.
Really?

00:30:45,847 --> 00:30:46,915
We all felt so sad,

00:30:46,915 --> 00:30:50,452
because my dad wasn't there
doing it for us.

00:30:50,452 --> 00:30:53,722
Interesting.
So it was kind of
a freaky experience.

00:30:53,722 --> 00:30:55,457
Hmm.
And it was eliminated
in our household

00:30:55,457 --> 00:30:57,059
probably within a month.
Yeah.

00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:59,194
So I don't think
This is gonna work.

00:30:59,194 --> 00:31:00,262
I'm out.

00:31:00,262 --> 00:31:02,998
Thank you
for your time.

00:31:02,998 --> 00:31:05,133
Mike, I'm just
trying to be clear--

00:31:05,133 --> 00:31:06,468
I can record my voice

00:31:06,468 --> 00:31:08,804
to my kids
within a stuffed animal.

00:31:08,804 --> 00:31:09,938
What's your distinct advantage?

00:31:09,938 --> 00:31:12,708
And you can send it to them
from anywhere in the world.

00:31:12,708 --> 00:31:14,109
So not only you,
But the grandparents

00:31:14,109 --> 00:31:16,044
that don't live nearby
can be doing it.

00:31:16,044 --> 00:31:17,446
You can be updating
stuff continually,

00:31:17,446 --> 00:31:19,514
you can...
so the only advantage is,

00:31:19,514 --> 00:31:21,850
I can attach yours
to the internet and update it?

00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:24,119
Correct, which means
you don't have to be there

00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:25,854
to put your voice on it.

00:31:25,854 --> 00:31:28,190
Mike, I just don't
see anything unique here.

00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:30,459
I don't think that being able
to record to the cloud

00:31:30,459 --> 00:31:33,729
is anything
significantly differentiated.

00:31:33,729 --> 00:31:35,597
(rips)
I'm out.

00:31:35,597 --> 00:31:38,266
Okay. Thanks, mark.

00:31:38,266 --> 00:31:39,401
Mike, I don't think
your being able to update

00:31:39,401 --> 00:31:42,738
is that big a deal.

00:31:42,738 --> 00:31:43,438
I'm out.

00:31:43,438 --> 00:31:46,708
Okay, thanks, Robert.
So, um...

00:31:46,708 --> 00:31:47,709
if I invested my money
in this,

00:31:47,709 --> 00:31:49,044
I'd sleep like a baby.

00:31:49,044 --> 00:31:51,580
I'd wake up
every two hours, crying,

00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:54,649
and asking my mommy,
"where's my money?"

00:31:54,649 --> 00:31:55,984
I'm out.

00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,988
So, Kevin...

00:31:59,988 --> 00:32:01,656
Yes, Mike?

00:32:01,656 --> 00:32:04,259
The power of this product
is in the emotional proposition.

00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:05,660
And what's missing
in your presentation--

00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:08,330
I'm not even gonna fight you
on valuation at this point,

00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:10,198
because it wouldn't matter
if you're asking

00:32:10,198 --> 00:32:11,600
for a $2 million value or 10.

00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,002
You don't know what
your customer acquisition Cost

00:32:14,002 --> 00:32:16,471
is going to be in a sustained
model. You just don't.

00:32:16,471 --> 00:32:18,907
Right.

00:32:18,907 --> 00:32:21,777
There's no way I would
give you $400,000.

00:32:21,777 --> 00:32:22,711
I'm out.

00:32:25,447 --> 00:32:26,581
Thanks for your time.

00:32:26,581 --> 00:32:27,716
Good luck.
Okay.

00:32:27,716 --> 00:32:29,251
Good luck.

Don't trust him as far

As I could throw him.

so when I got back
into sprinting

00:33:15,664 --> 00:33:17,132
after a 30-year break,

00:33:17,132 --> 00:33:18,733
I was injured constantly,
and a friend suggested

00:33:18,733 --> 00:33:20,869
that taking off my shoes
might be a cure.

00:33:20,869 --> 00:33:23,071
So I did, and it was.

00:33:23,071 --> 00:33:25,240

00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:34,049
Our product
is kind of deceptive

00:33:34,049 --> 00:33:35,584
in that it looks
really simple,

00:33:35,584 --> 00:33:37,719
but it's actually
part of a revolution.

00:33:37,719 --> 00:33:40,388

of the heavily padded,

And on the other foot,
I'm gonna do our 6mm contact,

00:36:07,936 --> 00:36:09,671
gives you
a little smoother ride,

00:36:09,671 --> 00:36:11,573
little--for people who want
a little extra cushion.

00:36:11,573 --> 00:36:12,574

00:36:14,042 --> 00:36:15,777
Either as
a do-It-Yourself kit

00:36:15,777 --> 00:36:18,847
that you can trim down
to your unique foot shape,

00:36:18,847 --> 00:36:21,916
um, or we can
custom-Make them for you.

00:36:21,916 --> 00:36:23,318
There's, like,
nothing to it.

00:36:23,318 --> 00:36:26,254

00:36:26,254 --> 00:36:27,122
You don't need
a lot of support.

00:36:27,122 --> 00:36:28,323
Putting your foot in support

00:36:28,323 --> 00:36:29,324
is like putting
your feet in a cast

00:36:29,324 --> 00:36:31,459
and expecting them
to get stronger.

00:36:31,459 --> 00:36:33,128
So when you walk
across our fake world...

00:36:33,128 --> 00:36:34,796
(daymond) Robert...
and get to feel
the world...

00:36:34,796 --> 00:36:35,930
Wait, let me
light the coals first.

00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:37,932
(laughter)
Ouch, ouch.

00:36:37,932 --> 00:36:39,200
The one on your left
is the closest to Barefoot,

00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,802
the one on your right gives you
a little smoother ride.

00:36:40,802 --> 00:36:43,805
It's like getting
a little foot massage, yeah?

00:36:43,805 --> 00:36:45,974
Ye--Oh, yeah.
Okay, Well, rob,
how do you feel?

00:36:45,974 --> 00:36:48,309
I gotta tell you,
they feel great.
(laughs)

00:36:48,309 --> 00:36:50,712
No, seriously, I know
they look weird, but...

00:36:50,712 --> 00:36:52,647
(daymond) So I don't want
to state the obvious,

00:36:52,647 --> 00:36:54,449
but you basically come over here
with some rubber and a string

00:36:54,449 --> 00:36:56,384
and you said it's worth
$5 million.
That's correct.

00:36:56,384 --> 00:36:58,720
Um, why do you feel that?

00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,321
We started this business
two and a half years ago.

00:37:00,321 --> 00:37:04,059
Uh, with just a web site.
No advertising.

00:37:04,059 --> 00:37:07,862
And since that time,
we've sold over $650,000

00:37:07,862 --> 00:37:09,664
of our do-It-Yourself
sandal kits

00:37:09,664 --> 00:37:11,066
and custom-Made...
in two years?

00:37:11,066 --> 00:37:13,068
In two and a half years.
In two and a half years.

00:37:13,068 --> 00:37:15,804
The last 2 months, we've done
a little over $130,000.

00:37:15,804 --> 00:37:17,138
Just alone, so...
So things are
going like this.

00:37:17,138 --> 00:37:19,841
This year we're on track
for about $1.2 million.
Yeah.

00:37:19,841 --> 00:37:21,576
On the $1.2 million, if you
hit it this year in sales,

00:37:21,576 --> 00:37:23,044
what will your profits be?

00:37:23,044 --> 00:37:25,180
We're projecting
$200,000 for this year.

00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,248
What's it cost to make?
What's it cost to sell?

00:37:27,248 --> 00:37:31,586
What we sell the most of is
our 4mm, uh, do-It-yourself kit,

00:37:31,586 --> 00:37:33,655
which retails for $24.95.

00:37:33,655 --> 00:37:36,591
Our cost of materials
is $3.11.

00:37:36,591 --> 00:37:38,526
What do you wholesale it for?

00:37:38,526 --> 00:37:40,662
Uh, $12.97.

00:37:40,662 --> 00:37:42,263
And what percent
is sold through Retail

00:37:42,263 --> 00:37:43,665
or other distribution,

00:37:43,665 --> 00:37:45,066
and what percent
is sold through your web site?

00:37:45,066 --> 00:37:47,802
Over 90% is sold--
Sold through our web site.

00:37:47,802 --> 00:37:49,938
We are just starting,
uh, in retail.

00:37:49,938 --> 00:37:52,841
We've got nine
retail locations currently.

00:37:52,841 --> 00:37:54,242
Six of them
have already reordered.

00:37:54,242 --> 00:37:55,376
(Robert) tell you, to me,
I open it up,

00:37:55,376 --> 00:37:58,780
and it looks like
just a plain piece of plastic.

00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,181
Like a broken sneaker.

00:38:00,181 --> 00:38:02,117
Yeah.
(laughter)

00:38:02,117 --> 00:38:03,118
(Kevin) You're gonna
make $200,000

00:38:03,118 --> 00:38:03,651
if everything goes right
this year.

00:38:03,651 --> 00:38:07,522
You're asking me to pay you
25 times that amount

00:38:07,522 --> 00:38:10,658
and value your business
at 25 times profit.

00:38:10,658 --> 00:38:13,194
That's correct.
But here's the other problem
I've got--

00:38:13,194 --> 00:38:14,929
If this category is growing
as fast as you say...
right.

00:38:14,929 --> 00:38:17,799
It's going to attract some very
big competitors at some point.
Yeah.

00:38:17,799 --> 00:38:19,000
And will look down at this
and say,

00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,603
"Mm. Piece of rubber.
Piece of string."

00:38:21,603 --> 00:38:23,471
Right.
"I can do the same thing

00:38:23,471 --> 00:38:25,106
"And put my distribution power
behind it

00:38:25,106 --> 00:38:26,975
and crush
these cockroaches."

00:38:26,975 --> 00:38:28,776
Well, first of all,
we do have a design patent,

00:38:28,776 --> 00:38:30,378
uh, pending on these.

00:38:30,378 --> 00:38:32,380
But it's a piece of rubber
and a string.

00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:35,116
It's more than that.
Steve, I promise you that
I can have these on the boat

00:38:35,116 --> 00:38:35,517
in about 30 days.

00:38:35,517 --> 00:38:37,318
Oh, I would
challenge you for that one.

00:38:37,318 --> 00:38:39,320
You want to challenge me?

00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,722
You cut a piece of rubber,
put a string on it,

00:38:40,722 --> 00:38:43,992
and you said that This is
great technology.

00:38:43,992 --> 00:38:45,793
And then you say
the company's worth $5 million,

00:38:45,793 --> 00:38:48,062
and you've only done...
no, we say the company's
worth $5 million

00:38:48,062 --> 00:38:51,466
because of
our industry experts.
Because of what?
The industry?

00:38:53,134 --> 00:38:54,135
I'm out.

00:38:55,737 --> 00:38:57,205
Steve, were you a shoe guy?

00:38:57,205 --> 00:38:58,640
No, no, no.
Like, how do you
wake up one day

00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,641
and say,
"I'm gonna make..."

00:38:59,641 --> 00:39:00,642
hold that thought.

00:39:00,642 --> 00:39:01,576
The tarahumara indians
in mexico--

00:39:01,576 --> 00:39:03,978
They did
their own version of this.

00:39:03,978 --> 00:39:05,780
I mean, this is, again,
a 15,000-year-Old idea.

00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,115
This is...
the tarahumara indians
in mexico

00:39:07,115 --> 00:39:08,983
are a people
who are known for running

00:39:08,983 --> 00:39:13,321
50, 60, 70 miles at a stretch
wearing nothing But sandals

00:39:13,321 --> 00:39:16,257
made out of scraps of tire
and bits of leather.

00:39:16,257 --> 00:39:17,525
Look, it's a huge
leap of faith.

00:39:17,525 --> 00:39:18,526
I believe
your whole granola story,

00:39:18,526 --> 00:39:20,061
and the indians
running around

00:39:20,061 --> 00:39:21,529
in the desert
and all that stuff.
(laughs)

00:39:21,529 --> 00:39:23,064
But on the other hand,
it's a crapshoot.

00:39:23,064 --> 00:39:24,599
I'll--I'll make you an offer
just for the Heck of it.

00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:28,002
I'll give you
the $400,000 for 50%.

00:39:28,002 --> 00:39:30,672
Okay.
You're worth about
800 grand, that's it.

00:39:30,672 --> 00:39:32,907
Okay. Thank you.
We'll come back to you on that.

00:39:32,907 --> 00:39:35,910
So back to some--
Wait, you need
to come back to him on that?

00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:36,844
Oh, well, it's not an offer

00:39:36,844 --> 00:39:38,780
that I would take
right off the bat.

00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:41,249
We value the equity much higher
than that at this point.

00:39:41,249 --> 00:39:42,517
Well, I know that, but that's
why you're in the shark tank.

00:39:42,517 --> 00:39:44,385
True.
You're here for money.
I'm a rational investor.

00:39:44,385 --> 00:39:50,124
You people are probably
delusional entrepreneurs.

00:39:50,124 --> 00:39:52,393
Perhaps.
And somewhere in the middle
is reality.

00:39:52,393 --> 00:39:55,530
Okay, uh, first off,
you give me a headache.

00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:56,798
I don't know why.
Oh, sorry.

00:39:56,798 --> 00:39:58,066
You remind me
of my first husband.

00:39:58,066 --> 00:40:00,468
You're a little Shorter,
but there's a similarity.
(laughs)

00:40:00,468 --> 00:40:01,936
and there's two things
driving me crazy--

00:40:01,936 --> 00:40:03,871
One is,
it's a black sole...

00:40:03,871 --> 00:40:04,839
well...
Which is hot.

00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:06,975
Secondly, it's got
a knot on the bottom.

00:40:06,975 --> 00:40:08,243
I would think
it would be uncomfortable,

00:40:08,243 --> 00:40:09,577
and that's a liability,
all right?

00:40:09,577 --> 00:40:12,180
So I'm not crazy
about the product.

00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,048
I have to be honest.

00:40:14,048 --> 00:40:15,049
I'm out.

00:40:16,851 --> 00:40:18,586
I love this stuff.
I'm a big runner.

00:40:18,586 --> 00:40:20,054
I'm getting old,
my knees hurt,

00:40:20,054 --> 00:40:22,056
I've tried everything.
This would be
the thing to try.

00:40:22,056 --> 00:40:23,391
Steve,
I would love to try it.
Sure.

00:40:23,391 --> 00:40:27,996
But $400,000, giving
the company a $5 million value,

00:40:27,996 --> 00:40:31,266
man, I can't try
for that price.

00:40:31,266 --> 00:40:32,734
I'm out.
Thank you.

00:40:32,734 --> 00:40:34,802
You have an offer
from somebody that's rational.
It's True.

00:40:34,802 --> 00:40:36,938
And I don't have
a shoe company in my portfolio.

00:40:36,938 --> 00:40:40,241
And I think your story--
I'm listening to it,

00:40:40,241 --> 00:40:42,176
it's got a shtick, and it's
a--really a marketing strategy.
Yeah.

00:40:42,176 --> 00:40:44,245
You've got rubber
and string.
Yeah.

00:40:44,245 --> 00:40:47,715
And I'm willing to say
it's worth $800,000.

00:40:47,715 --> 00:40:51,919
I'd give you $400,000 for 50%.
It's a clean deal.

00:40:51,919 --> 00:40:53,921
50% is way beyond
what we're willing to do.

00:40:53,921 --> 00:40:54,922
What's your counter?

00:40:54,922 --> 00:40:55,990
Uh, my counter would be 10%.

00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:58,459
You're out of your mind.

00:40:58,459 --> 00:41:00,128
One of the other companies
that's also in this space

00:41:00,128 --> 00:41:04,866
recently, uh, got $10 million
for 25% of their company

00:41:04,866 --> 00:41:07,068
based on the--a multiple
of their projections

00:41:07,068 --> 00:41:09,203
for the following year.

00:41:09,203 --> 00:41:10,538
First of all, because
one of your competitors

00:41:10,538 --> 00:41:16,110
got someone to put money in
at a ridiculous valuation

00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,912
doesn't make that
a comp for you guys.

00:41:17,912 --> 00:41:20,181
It just means you're competing
against someone

00:41:20,181 --> 00:41:22,116
that's got
stupid money behind them.

00:41:22,116 --> 00:41:24,786
Do you know what they call
a bunch of investors

00:41:24,786 --> 00:41:26,387
rushing into a hot area,
like you've mentioned,

00:41:26,387 --> 00:41:27,855
with all these
other investors?

00:41:27,855 --> 00:41:29,657
They call it a bubble.

00:41:29,657 --> 00:41:31,659
And no one's a bigger expert
at getting out of a bubble

00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:33,728
at the right time
than I am,

00:41:33,728 --> 00:41:36,197
so I'm telling you,
you should take Kevin's deal,

00:41:36,197 --> 00:41:38,132
because your bubble
is going to pop.

00:41:41,269 --> 00:41:41,336
I'm out.

00:41:47,108 --> 00:41:50,378
Okay. There are no other
sharks here.

00:41:50,378 --> 00:41:51,779
Correct.

00:41:51,779 --> 00:41:55,183
There's just you, me, Lena,

00:41:55,183 --> 00:41:56,451
the rubber, and the string.

00:41:57,919 --> 00:42:00,254
What are you going to do?

00:42:00,254 --> 00:42:04,525
I'm gonna give you $400,000
for 50% of this company.

00:42:08,663 --> 00:42:11,065
That's an offer we're not
willing to take at this time.

00:42:11,065 --> 00:42:12,266
Very well.
You're dead to me.

00:42:12,266 --> 00:42:13,935
Run out of here
in bare feet.

00:42:13,935 --> 00:42:16,204
(laughter)
(daymond) Thank you, guys.

00:42:16,204 --> 00:42:18,306
Thank you for your time.
Thanks. Pleasure. Thanks.

00:42:21,442 --> 00:42:22,510
Now that we're dead to Kevin,

00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:25,513
we're gonna have to show him
that he made the wrong decision.

00:42:25,513 --> 00:42:26,914
We have so many people
who love our product

00:42:26,914 --> 00:42:28,516
and have experienced
Real benefits from it.

00:42:28,516 --> 00:42:31,919
We know that this is something
that there's a real market for,

00:42:31,919 --> 00:42:33,388
and we're just gonna continue
to do what we do.
