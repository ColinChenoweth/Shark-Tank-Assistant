00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:01,735
Narrator:
The sharks are back

00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:03,670
in an all-New season
of "Shark tank,"

00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,740
where Hopeful entrepreneurs
from across the country

00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,076
dream of a chance
to secure an investment

00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:10,811
and gain powerful partners

00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:14,414
to start, grow,
or save their businesses.

00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:17,150
Haynes: Cinderella's proof
that one pair of shoes

00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,685
can change your life.

00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,554
Narrator:
If the sharks hear a great idea,

00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:23,290
they're ready to invest
using their own money.

00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,093
Your branding and packaging
is terrific.

00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:29,096
And they'll fight each other
for a piece of the action.

00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:29,429
Let me ask you a question,
all right?

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:30,964
I just want
to finish up --

00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:32,432
Let me ask you guys a simple --
I want to finish --

00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:34,268
Barbara,
you're driving me crazy.
Excuse me.

00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:36,069
You're driving me crazy.

00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,405
But first, the entrepreneurs
must convince a shark

00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:41,008
to invest the full amount
they're asking for,

00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:43,610
or they'll walk away
with nothing.

00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,679
I have a great idea.
I know I do.

00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,281
I just don't think
I trust you.

00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:47,881
Narrator: It's sink...

00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,349
there are a lot of things
that sell that don't work.

00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:51,084
...or swim.

00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:52,486
I don't have all the answers.
That's the plan?

00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:54,354
Uh...

00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:56,957
NARRATOR:
Who are the sharks?

00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:01,628
They're self-Made millionaire
and billionaire investors

00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:04,231
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.

00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:08,335
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist

00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:11,138
who turned a $10,000 loan

00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:15,342
into a software business
worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:17,744
Barbara Corcoran
went from working

00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,680
as a waitress in manhattan

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,150
to building the city's
preeminent real-Estate empire.

00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,887
Daymond John is a fashion mogul
and branding expert

00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:28,622
Who grew
his homemade clothing line

00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:32,426
into the globally recognized
fashion brand fubu.

00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:35,829
Robert herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,

00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,564
is now a technology mogul

00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:41,601
who sold his first internet
companies for over $350 million.

00:01:44,567 --> 00:01:49,039
And mark cuban -- Notorious
billionaire entrepreneur

00:01:49,039 --> 00:02:00,183
and the outspoken owner
of the Dallas mavericks.

00:02:00,183 --> 00:02:01,651
First up are Neil Cameron,

Peter Ferreira,
and Dennis iannoti,

00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:08,525
who are seeking an investment
for their pumped-Up nut butters.

00:02:11,061 --> 00:02:12,729
Hi, sharks.
I'm Neil Cameron.

00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:14,030
I'm Peter Ferreira.

00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,032
I'm Dennis iannoti.
And we're...

00:02:16,032 --> 00:02:17,367
ALL: Nuts 'n more.

00:02:17,367 --> 00:02:19,502
We are seeking
$250,000

00:02:19,502 --> 00:02:22,639
for a 20% equity stake
in our company.

00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,909
Good ol' p.B.
Just got a face-Lift.

00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:27,978
Nuts 'n more
are fortified butters

00:02:27,978 --> 00:02:29,846
with added protein,
added omegas.

00:02:29,846 --> 00:02:31,514
They're high in fiber
with no sugar added.

00:02:31,514 --> 00:02:34,117
Nuts 'n more was born
this past year

00:02:34,117 --> 00:02:36,519
in a small corner
of my family's bakery shop.

00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:39,789
We ground lots of nuts,
mixed ingredients together,

00:02:39,789 --> 00:02:41,458
and filled jars
by hand.

00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,994
It wasn't long
before nuts 'n more

00:02:43,994 --> 00:02:46,796
was ready for its big debut
on the shelves.

00:02:46,796 --> 00:02:48,298
We were
instantly recognized

00:02:48,298 --> 00:02:50,500
by Pro fitness athletes,
celebrities,

00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,235
and more importantly,

00:02:52,235 --> 00:02:56,039
nutritional stores were Buying
our products by the minute.

00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:59,242
With your help,
we'll be able to take our nuts

00:02:59,242 --> 00:03:00,443
to the next level,
where it belongs.

00:03:00,443 --> 00:03:02,112
[ chuckles ]

00:03:02,112 --> 00:03:06,116
So, sharks, are you ready
for some aggressive expansion?

00:03:06,116 --> 00:03:07,384
Can we try it?

00:03:07,384 --> 00:03:08,785
Absolutely.
You're gonna try it
right now.

00:03:08,785 --> 00:03:09,853
Here you go.

00:03:12,122 --> 00:03:13,590
We have four varieties
right now.

00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,259
They're fortified
with protein and flax.

00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:18,995
We have a peanut butter,
a chocolate peanut butter,

00:03:18,995 --> 00:03:21,364
an Almond,
and a chocolate Almond.

00:03:21,364 --> 00:03:23,366
Do people
like the taste?

00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:24,567
Absolutely.
They love the taste.

00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:27,437
The Almond butter is way better
than the peanut butter.

00:03:28,972 --> 00:03:30,707
I love peanut butter.
Have it every morning.

00:03:30,707 --> 00:03:32,042
So, why is it
better for me?

00:03:32,042 --> 00:03:32,642
Because you have
double protein.

00:03:32,642 --> 00:03:34,110
So you got 14 Grams
of protein

00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,845
compared
to seven per serving.

00:03:35,845 --> 00:03:37,380
We put flaxseed in it.

00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,183
It's what gives you
the omegas -- 3, 6, 9s.

00:03:40,183 --> 00:03:40,917
And you get
the added fiber.

00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:44,187
So, just so we don't think
you're absolutely nuts...

00:03:44,187 --> 00:03:45,388
[ laughter ]

00:03:45,388 --> 00:03:46,990
...said you've only been open
a year.

00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:47,991
Correct.

00:03:47,991 --> 00:03:48,992
Actually,
a little less than that.

00:03:48,992 --> 00:03:49,659
All right.

00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:51,728
Sooner or later, we're gonna get
to this valuation of...

00:03:51,728 --> 00:03:53,530
we'll get to it now,
I guess.

00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,433
...$1.25 million...

00:03:56,433 --> 00:03:57,434
what?

00:03:57,434 --> 00:03:58,435
...for your company.

00:03:58,435 --> 00:04:00,303
You've been open
a year.

00:04:00,303 --> 00:04:01,438
Boy, let's hear it.

00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:04,441
Cameron: Yep.
What are the sales?

00:04:04,441 --> 00:04:06,776
So, we've actually started
selling about five months ago.

00:04:06,776 --> 00:04:09,166
We've been open
a little less than a year.

00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,902
To date,
we have $100,000 in sales.

00:04:11,902 --> 00:04:13,103
Wow.

00:04:13,103 --> 00:04:13,704
The valuation is
where it is

00:04:13,704 --> 00:04:15,372
because we've been
approached

00:04:15,372 --> 00:04:17,241
by the country's
largest national distributor.

00:04:17,241 --> 00:04:17,908
Mm-hmm.

00:04:17,908 --> 00:04:20,577
And they have got nine
warehouses across the country,

00:04:20,577 --> 00:04:23,580
and if we were to put a pallet
in each warehouse,

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,315
that would be a little over
$1 million in revenue.

00:04:25,315 --> 00:04:28,218
Okay.
Have they actually ordered?

00:04:28,218 --> 00:04:31,488
They haven't ordered
because we can't fulfill.

00:04:32,623 --> 00:04:35,826
What is it retailing for,
and what are you making it for?

00:04:35,826 --> 00:04:38,495
So, the peanut retails
for $10.99.

00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:39,496
Whoa.

00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:44,435
And the Almond
is $12.99.

00:04:44,435 --> 00:04:45,569
And how much
do you make it for?

00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:48,772
We make the peanut for $2.90
and the Almond for $4.

00:04:48,772 --> 00:04:50,841
With this investment,

00:04:50,841 --> 00:04:51,842
we'll be able
to secure raw materials

00:04:51,842 --> 00:04:52,843
at a much higher volume.

00:04:52,843 --> 00:04:54,511
And bring it down.

00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:56,447
It would bring the price
of our peanut butter down $1.50.

00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:01,051
See if you can convince me
on the $1.3 million value.

00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,352
O'Leary:
$1.250 million.

00:05:02,352 --> 00:05:04,288
It's the brand.

00:05:04,288 --> 00:05:04,822
The brand?

00:05:07,424 --> 00:05:09,092
But who knows
this brand today?

00:05:09,092 --> 00:05:11,295
Our name is starting
to become synonymous

00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,563
with
the health nut butter --

00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:14,164
CUBAN: Tell me
about the reorders.

00:05:14,164 --> 00:05:15,499
Are you getting reorders?

00:05:15,499 --> 00:05:17,501
We are getting --
Every single week.

00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:19,102
Okay.
That's how many accounts?

00:05:19,102 --> 00:05:20,704
32 retail outlets.

00:05:20,704 --> 00:05:22,506
That's out of 35,000.

00:05:22,506 --> 00:05:24,641
So, you got
32 retail outlets.

00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:25,909
And we have online.
We have online.
We have online.

00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,511
What percentage of your business
is online?

00:05:27,511 --> 00:05:28,779
It's about 50%.

00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:30,581
So, you're selling
about 70 units a month

00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,516
from most stores,

00:05:32,516 --> 00:05:32,983
and they're reordering, and
they're continuing to reorder?

00:05:32,983 --> 00:05:34,418
Reorder
almost every week.

00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:35,752
Yeah.
Absolutely.

00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:36,954
Dennis,
I'll give you this.

00:05:36,954 --> 00:05:37,621
It is a great name.

00:05:37,621 --> 00:05:40,557
You guys are big guys.
You work out, obviously.

00:05:40,557 --> 00:05:43,160
It's not, like, a guy like Kevin
selling your product.

00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,428
Was that an insult?

00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:46,096
Oh, no. Just fact.

00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,098
Come on the squash court
with me. I'll kick your ass.

00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,167
[ laughs ]

00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:51,635
But I think
my challenge is this.

00:05:51,635 --> 00:05:55,038
You're asking
for a value of the company

00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:57,441
as though
you've already made it.

00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:58,108
Right.

00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,110
As though you've already got
all those big orders.

00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,846
But we cannot commit
to these distributors

00:06:02,846 --> 00:06:03,780
if we cannot deliver.

00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,316
But that's what you need.

00:06:06,316 --> 00:06:08,151
That's not
what the business is worth.

00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:11,421
I mean, are you saying you need
the $250,000 in cash

00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:14,291
to fulfill the orders,
no matter what?

00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,492
Well, no.

00:06:15,492 --> 00:06:17,427
That's to do
a few other things.

00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:18,295
That's to staff.

00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:22,432
That's to shore up a few of
our equipment in our facility,

00:06:22,432 --> 00:06:23,834
to be able
to reduce our overall costs.

00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:26,036
Right now,
we're at $2.90.

00:06:26,036 --> 00:06:27,571
That jar
initially cost us $4.

00:06:27,571 --> 00:06:28,705
Okay, so you're processing

00:06:28,705 --> 00:06:29,706
and putting this all together
yourself?

00:06:29,706 --> 00:06:31,842
Absolutely.
And you're packaging it
yourself?

00:06:31,842 --> 00:06:32,976
Yep.

00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,244
Iannoti: When we started
this brand,

00:06:34,244 --> 00:06:35,979
we had fitness pros
come to us.

00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,782
Now, these are bodybuilders.
These are bikini people.

00:06:38,782 --> 00:06:40,050
Guys, listen. Listen.

00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,619
I like you.
We're from the same tribe.

00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:43,754
We're exactly the same.

00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:48,292
What tribe is that,
daymond?

00:06:48,292 --> 00:06:49,092
You know,
young, handsome, and built.

00:06:49,092 --> 00:06:50,627
Very True.
You know it.

00:06:51,628 --> 00:06:55,032
The issue here is,
your valuation's so crazy,

00:06:55,032 --> 00:06:57,434
and you're working
on assumptions.

00:06:57,434 --> 00:07:00,437
I'm a customer
but not an investor.

00:07:00,437 --> 00:07:01,505
I'm out.

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,108
Your branding and packaging
is terrific.

00:07:05,108 --> 00:07:07,311
That's your work?

00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:09,246
I'm a graphic designer.
She never says that.

00:07:09,246 --> 00:07:09,713
She never says that.

00:07:09,713 --> 00:07:12,649
Thank you.
Everything's done
in-House.

00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:15,352
I feel like I'm opening
expensive women's face cream.

00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:16,753
This is a heartbreaker.

00:07:18,956 --> 00:07:20,157
It really is.

00:07:20,157 --> 00:07:21,758
Great packaging,
great name.

00:07:21,758 --> 00:07:26,964
What a shame that you price this
at $250,000.

00:07:26,964 --> 00:07:29,366
What a shame.

00:07:31,168 --> 00:07:33,036
She's basically
calling you bozos.

00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,972
We're here to negotiate, too,
just with you.

00:07:34,972 --> 00:07:37,040
For me
to give you $250,000,

00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,576
I would have to take
80% of the business.

00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,180
I might be willing
to do it for 79%.

00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,648
[ chuckles ]
let me ask you a question,
all right?

00:07:44,648 --> 00:07:46,183
I just want
to finish up --

00:07:46,183 --> 00:07:47,651
Let me ask you guys a simple --
I want to finish --

00:07:47,651 --> 00:07:48,885
Barbara,
you're driving me crazy.
Excuse me.

00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,088
I want
to finish one paragraph.

00:07:51,088 --> 00:07:52,356
You're driving me crazy.

00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,159
I just want to tell you
I'm so sad, but I'm out.

00:07:57,961 --> 00:07:59,696
Now she's dead to you,
all right?

00:07:59,696 --> 00:08:00,964
Let's move on.

00:08:00,964 --> 00:08:02,899
That purchase order
from the distributor...

00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,101
Yeah.

00:08:04,101 --> 00:08:05,969
...there's a whole industry
of people

00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:08,772
that give you cash
for purchase orders.

00:08:08,772 --> 00:08:11,441
Why didn't you get
the purchase order?

00:08:11,441 --> 00:08:14,333
It was, unfortunately,
due to fulfillment.

00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,803
We need the capital to bring
the cost of the jar down

00:08:16,803 --> 00:08:18,271
a little bit more.

00:08:18,271 --> 00:08:20,540
What is the wholesale price
you're selling at?

00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:25,378
Wholesale for peanut is $5.75,
and Almond is $7.25.

00:08:25,378 --> 00:08:26,579
So, your margins
aren't big enough

00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:27,914
'cause they don't have
the capital.

00:08:27,914 --> 00:08:30,583
O'Leary: So, let me
take a stab at it.

00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:33,452
No. No, I won't
give you $250,000 for 20%.

00:08:35,254 --> 00:08:36,789
There is no chance in --

00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:39,058
I can't even say
what I want to say.

00:08:39,058 --> 00:08:41,460
Kevin. Kevin.
We -- Kevin.

00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,664
We know
you love to wet your beak,

00:08:44,664 --> 00:08:48,467
and we want you to be part
of the nuts 'n more team.

00:08:48,467 --> 00:08:51,938
$250,000, I'd have to own
the whole business,

00:08:51,938 --> 00:08:55,107
all your cars,
all your houses.

00:08:55,107 --> 00:08:57,043
Or you can
adjust the equity.

00:08:57,043 --> 00:08:59,045
Okay. I need 264%.

00:08:59,045 --> 00:09:00,780
[ chuckles ]

00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,981
I'm out.

00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,986
Give me a total dollar amount
that you need to buy

00:09:06,986 --> 00:09:09,856
in order to get your prices down
to where you want them to go.

00:09:09,856 --> 00:09:12,859
About, um...$7,000.

00:09:12,859 --> 00:09:15,194
$7,000?
Yep.

00:09:15,194 --> 00:09:16,395
That's it?
That's just
for peanuts.

00:09:16,395 --> 00:09:18,464
That's just the peanut.
What I'm trying
to figure out

00:09:18,464 --> 00:09:20,666
is the least amount of cash
it'll take

00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,535
to get you
to the highest margins.

00:09:22,535 --> 00:09:23,002
Sure.

00:09:23,002 --> 00:09:25,538
How much in aggregate
will you have to spend

00:09:25,538 --> 00:09:27,874
to get to your optimal
cost of goods sold?

00:09:27,874 --> 00:09:30,243
I think
mark's onto something.

00:09:30,243 --> 00:09:31,310
Right.

00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:35,047
If I spent $50,000,
I can fulfill that one order,

00:09:35,047 --> 00:09:38,050
make a little bit of money,
and get my volume going.

00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,051
Is that right?

00:09:39,051 --> 00:09:40,319
Absolutely.

00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:42,121
Mark, I think at $50,000,

00:09:42,121 --> 00:09:44,924
they lower their price point,
and they can take orders.

00:09:46,192 --> 00:09:48,394
I'm gonna propose something,
Robert.

00:09:48,394 --> 00:09:49,795
Tell me
if you'd like to join me.

00:09:49,795 --> 00:09:51,063
Yep, I'm listening.

00:10:06,345 --> 00:10:08,481
I'm gonna propose something,
Robert.

00:10:08,481 --> 00:10:09,348
Tell me
if you'd like to join me.

00:10:09,348 --> 00:10:10,816
Yep, I'm listening.

00:10:10,816 --> 00:10:13,953
We have $250,000 for 35%.

00:10:13,953 --> 00:10:16,489
No, mark.
Hold on. Let me finish.

00:10:16,489 --> 00:10:18,291
Let me finish.
Right?

00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,092
But there's a contingency.

00:10:22,094 --> 00:10:24,563
$75,000 in cash
up front

00:10:24,563 --> 00:10:28,034
and then the balance
where and when you need it

00:10:28,034 --> 00:10:30,703
to fund
future purchase orders.

00:10:30,703 --> 00:10:32,038
So, I love that,

00:10:32,038 --> 00:10:36,342
but I was gonna offer you
$250,000 for 50%.

00:10:36,342 --> 00:10:38,611
I think there's a lot of value
in having two sharks.

00:10:38,611 --> 00:10:40,212
And look, let's be honest.

00:10:40,212 --> 00:10:41,080
You haven't
proven the business.

00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,081
You've proven a concept.

00:10:45,084 --> 00:10:47,286
You guys are nuts
if you don't take that.

00:10:50,623 --> 00:10:51,290
Why don't you guys go think
about it?

00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,825
Yeah, can we think
about it?
Yeah.

00:10:52,825 --> 00:10:53,960
So we can
talk about it, too.

00:10:55,227 --> 00:10:57,496
All right,
so what do you guys think?

00:10:57,496 --> 00:10:58,164
I think
50% is way too much.

00:10:58,164 --> 00:10:59,498
We're not
giving up 50%.

00:10:59,498 --> 00:11:03,169
I actually like --
I like cuban's tiered.

00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:04,170
I love it.

00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,304
Because
we're gonna crush it.

00:11:05,304 --> 00:11:06,772
You know
we're gonna crush it.

00:11:06,772 --> 00:11:07,974
50% is gonna create
more problems than it solves,

00:11:07,974 --> 00:11:09,141
simply because
there's 16% each,

00:11:09,141 --> 00:11:11,210
and they're gonna
get resentful.

00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,678
Cameron: I'd love
to have Robert in, too, but --

00:11:12,678 --> 00:11:15,414
It's too much.
It's too much.

00:11:15,414 --> 00:11:16,415
Herjavec:
These guys are tough.

00:11:16,415 --> 00:11:18,084
They're gonna
negotiate us up.

00:11:18,084 --> 00:11:19,752
You start at 35%,
we're gonna end up at 25%.

00:11:19,752 --> 00:11:20,619
Let's just see
what happens.

00:11:20,619 --> 00:11:22,688
Here they come.
Cool it.

00:11:24,557 --> 00:11:26,959
All right, guys.
What did youse guys decide?

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,895
We would love
to have both of you.

00:11:29,895 --> 00:11:33,499
We think
50% is too much.

00:11:33,499 --> 00:11:34,834
We've worked
unbelievably hard,

00:11:34,834 --> 00:11:37,770
and we are going to continue
to work hard.

00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,772
We'd really love
to get you down

00:11:39,772 --> 00:11:41,273
maybe to 30%
with that tiered approach.

00:11:43,476 --> 00:11:45,144
'cause we can prove to you
with that approach,

00:11:45,144 --> 00:11:47,279
you're putting
a little skin in the game

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,349
to see
what the return will be

00:11:50,349 --> 00:11:52,551
and to know that you've made
a solid, sound investment...

00:11:54,553 --> 00:11:56,222
...and that you've got
three guys

00:11:56,222 --> 00:11:57,890
who are working their tails off
to get that home.

00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:00,292
Robert,
what's your feeling?

00:12:00,292 --> 00:12:02,428
I'm not in at 30%.

00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:10,636
I'll go down
to mark's 35%.

00:12:12,104 --> 00:12:12,972
35%?

00:12:12,972 --> 00:12:22,214
35%.

00:12:22,214 --> 00:12:23,416
You guys got a deal.

00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,017
All right.
Got it.

00:12:26,752 --> 00:12:28,020
Good job.

00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,222
All right, will I look like you
if I, uh...

00:12:30,222 --> 00:12:31,223
absolutely.

00:12:31,223 --> 00:12:31,824
All right,
man.

00:12:31,824 --> 00:12:32,825
Good job.

00:12:32,825 --> 00:12:33,826
Nice job.

00:12:33,826 --> 00:12:35,027
Thank you, guys.
Thanks, guys.

00:12:35,027 --> 00:12:36,028
Cameron: Thank you.
Have a good one.

00:12:38,898 --> 00:12:40,166
Killed it.
Pete.

00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,901
John: You know what I loved
about them?

00:12:41,901 --> 00:12:43,436
They didn't get caught up
in the big number.

00:12:43,436 --> 00:12:45,905
They really wanted
what they needed.

00:12:45,905 --> 00:12:47,807
Yep.
Did you bozos just pay
a quarter million dollars

00:12:47,807 --> 00:12:48,808
for peanut butter?

00:12:48,808 --> 00:12:49,809
Yes.

NARRATOR:
Earlier this season,

00:12:58,617 --> 00:13:02,221
Mike hartwick and Sarah ponn
made a deal with mark Cuban

00:13:02,221 --> 00:13:03,956
for their unique
surf-Inspired workout,

00:13:03,956 --> 00:13:05,224
surfset fitness.

00:13:05,224 --> 00:13:07,093
Mark, we're gonna
accept your offer.

00:13:07,093 --> 00:13:08,494
That's what
I'm talking about.

00:13:08,494 --> 00:13:10,162
Ah.

00:13:10,162 --> 00:13:12,431
Narrator: Let's see
what they're up to now.

00:13:13,499 --> 00:13:17,570
Since "Shark tank,"
we've been constantly traveling.

00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,238
We've actually hit
22 cities,

00:13:19,238 --> 00:13:21,173
certifying
over 500 surfset trainers.

00:13:21,173 --> 00:13:23,008
We'll get you listed up
on our website.

00:13:23,008 --> 00:13:24,543
We'll get the studio open.

00:13:24,543 --> 00:13:25,611
We've been living
in our tour bus.

00:13:25,611 --> 00:13:27,213
It's been our mobile office
and our home,

00:13:27,213 --> 00:13:28,814
and the demand is growing
with each stop,

00:13:28,814 --> 00:13:30,349
and we're just Loving
every minute of it.

00:13:30,349 --> 00:13:31,350
Four more.

00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,485
Really?
Yeah.

00:13:32,485 --> 00:13:34,019
Awesome.
Yes.

00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:36,021
Hartwick:
Two, one, pump it up.

00:13:36,021 --> 00:13:39,625
Ponn: Today, we're in
Los Angeles at crunch gym.

00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,360
We've actually set up a deal
with mark and crunch

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,096
to roll out surfset classes
at all of their major locations.

00:13:44,096 --> 00:13:45,898
Ponn:
Two, one, bring it up.

00:13:45,898 --> 00:13:47,633
What's up, guys?

00:13:47,633 --> 00:13:48,901
Mark. What's going on?
Hey, mark.

00:13:48,901 --> 00:13:49,902
Looking good.
How are you?

00:13:49,902 --> 00:13:51,637
Cuban:
I'm dropping in

00:13:51,637 --> 00:13:52,171
on Mike and Sarah's classes
here today at crunch.

00:13:52,171 --> 00:13:54,573
They've been going
full gangbusters,

00:13:54,573 --> 00:13:55,808
and I wanted
to see them in action.

00:13:55,808 --> 00:13:58,277
Left foot comes up,
right foot comes up, turn.

00:13:58,277 --> 00:14:01,547
These guys are on a mission,
and I'm proud to be part of it,

00:14:01,547 --> 00:14:02,348
and I have no doubt in my mind

00:14:02,348 --> 00:14:04,617
that they're gonna be
every bit the Winner

00:14:04,617 --> 00:14:06,152
I knew they would
when they came on the show.

00:14:06,152 --> 00:14:06,886
There you go.
Nice.

00:14:06,886 --> 00:14:10,156
Prior to going on "Shark tank,"
we did $190,000 in sales.

00:14:10,156 --> 00:14:11,690
Is it a great class,
everybody?

00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:12,758
You guys like it?
[ cheers and applause ]

00:14:12,758 --> 00:14:14,426
HARTWICK:
Since going on "Shark tank,"

00:14:14,426 --> 00:14:16,095
we've done close to $500,000
in just two months.

00:14:16,095 --> 00:14:17,296
We're actually on track

00:14:17,296 --> 00:14:19,431
to hit $5 million
in This first year.

00:14:19,431 --> 00:14:21,233
It sounds corny,
but it is the american dream,

00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:23,836
and we honestly feel
like we're living it.

00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:39,118
Narrator: Next into the tank
is romy taormina,

00:14:39,118 --> 00:14:44,723

00:14:57,476 --> 00:14:59,345
I am seeking $250,000

00:14:59,345 --> 00:15:01,981
in exchange for 10% equity
in my business.

00:15:01,981 --> 00:15:07,052
Psi bands are the stylish way
to quell the queasies.

00:15:07,052 --> 00:15:10,122
They are mom-Invented,
patented,

00:15:10,122 --> 00:15:13,526
and fda-Cleared
acupressure wrist bands

00:15:13,526 --> 00:15:14,927
for the relief of nausea,

00:15:14,927 --> 00:15:16,462
like for the pregnant woman

00:15:16,462 --> 00:15:18,063
who suffers
from MORNING sickness

00:15:18,063 --> 00:15:21,400
or the traveler who has saved
all year for a Cruise

00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,336
and doesn't want to suffer
from MOTION sickness

00:15:24,336 --> 00:15:26,138
or the CANCER patient

00:15:26,138 --> 00:15:29,408
who is facing their next round
of chemotherapy.

00:15:29,408 --> 00:15:31,544
I suffered from DEBILITATING
morning sickness

00:15:31,544 --> 00:15:33,212
during both of my pregnancies

00:15:33,212 --> 00:15:37,650
and wore acupressure wrist bands
to relieve my nausea.

00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:38,584
But I was frustrated

00:15:38,584 --> 00:15:40,834
with the existing products
on the market that were dated.

00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:42,436
They stretched out over time,

00:15:42,436 --> 00:15:43,904
and I couldn't wear them
in the shower,

00:15:43,904 --> 00:15:45,706
or else
They'd get waterlogged.

00:15:45,706 --> 00:15:50,644
So I created something both
fashionable and functional.

00:15:50,644 --> 00:15:52,780
Psi bands are
uniquely waterproof,

00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,649
available
in several fun colors,

00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:57,851
and adjustable around
the circumference of the wrist,

00:15:57,851 --> 00:16:00,187
as well as
at the acupressure point

00:16:00,187 --> 00:16:03,123
for personalized comfort
and fit.

00:16:03,123 --> 00:16:05,459
The adjustable orb
creates pressure

00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:08,062
on the acupressure point
to relieve nausea.

00:16:08,062 --> 00:16:10,831
I invite you
to invest in a company

00:16:10,831 --> 00:16:12,032
that is already profitable.

00:16:12,032 --> 00:16:14,435
Now I'd like
to pass out some samples.

00:16:14,435 --> 00:16:16,904
Robert,
this is the Cherry Blossom.

00:16:16,904 --> 00:16:18,038
Thank you, romy.

00:16:18,038 --> 00:16:18,439
Barbara,
this is the color play.

00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:20,040
Thank you.

00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,909
And this is the block party,
Kevin.
Thank you.

00:16:21,909 --> 00:16:23,644
Daymond.
John: Thank you.

00:16:23,644 --> 00:16:25,446
And these will look
wonderfully on you, mark.

00:16:25,446 --> 00:16:29,600
Romy, is there any proof
that this actually works?

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,802
It's an fda-Cleared
medical device.

00:16:31,802 --> 00:16:33,537
That's not an answer
to the question.
No, no.
That's not what I'm asking.

00:16:33,537 --> 00:16:35,606
What I'm asking is,

00:16:35,606 --> 00:16:38,609
is there any medical proof
that this actually works?

00:16:38,609 --> 00:16:41,500
Yes, there are clinical studies
that have been conducted

00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,802
to effectively show
that they relieve nausea.

00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:45,604
Why?

00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,205
It's a nei guan
acupressure point,

00:16:47,205 --> 00:16:49,141
which is located
2.5 finger Widths

00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:51,476
above your wrist crease
between the wrist tendons.

00:16:51,476 --> 00:16:55,280
Acupressure has been practiced
for more than 5,000 years.

00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,951
It's non-Invasive,
it's affordable, and it works.

00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,953
So, romy, you've been
selling these for how long?

00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:02,955
We launched in 2007.

00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,623
And what are your sales
for the last 12 months?

00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:05,824
Almost $1 million.

00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:07,759
Whoa.

00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:11,296
Romy, you've sold $1 million
of these in the last 12 months?

00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:12,297
Yes.

00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,032
How?

00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:16,433
We are selling nationally
as well as internationally.

00:17:16,433 --> 00:17:19,970
We're selling in more than 6,000
u.S. Retail locations.

00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,772
What did you make
on the $1 million?

00:17:21,772 --> 00:17:23,840
We had 11% net profit.

00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,375
Why is the profit so low?

00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:28,512
It's not low.

00:17:28,512 --> 00:17:31,367
You're selling $1 million,
and you're only making $110,000.

00:17:31,367 --> 00:17:33,236
Do you take a salary
out of that?

00:17:33,236 --> 00:17:35,000
We do.
It's $100,000.

00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,967
That adds another 10%.

00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:37,700
Walk me
through the numbers.

00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,902
What does it cost you
to make this?

00:17:39,902 --> 00:17:41,237
They retail for $15,

00:17:41,237 --> 00:17:42,972
and we have
a 60% gross profit margin.

00:17:42,972 --> 00:17:46,042
So, in $1 million,
your gross margin is $600,000.

00:17:46,042 --> 00:17:47,109
Yes.

00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:49,745
And you're clearing
$110,000.

00:17:49,745 --> 00:17:52,081
Add your salary back.
That's $200,000.

00:17:52,081 --> 00:17:53,616
What happened
to the other $400,000?

00:17:53,616 --> 00:17:55,351
It goes to overhead.

00:17:55,351 --> 00:18:00,233
It goes to bookkeeping,
rent, utilities.

00:18:00,233 --> 00:18:02,567
Do you have any debt
in the company?

00:18:02,567 --> 00:18:03,968
We do have debt. Yes.
How much debt do you have?

00:18:03,968 --> 00:18:06,037
We have $600,000
in debt.

00:18:06,037 --> 00:18:06,171
Ah.

00:18:06,171 --> 00:18:08,573
Which includes
past deferred salaries

00:18:08,573 --> 00:18:10,241
that we didn't take
for the first four years.

00:18:10,241 --> 00:18:11,976
Okay,
but how much of that --

00:18:11,976 --> 00:18:13,111
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hang on.
Wait, wait, wait.

00:18:13,111 --> 00:18:15,180
Are you saying
that because you didn't

00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:19,133
pay yourself in the past,
you consider that debt today?

00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:19,533
Yes, I do.

00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:22,402
Seriously?

00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:24,171
Corcoran: Romy.

00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:25,172
Yes.

00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:26,173
Obviously,
your passion...

00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:27,508
is phenomenal.

00:18:27,508 --> 00:18:28,509
Thank you, Barbara.

00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:30,043
No one can doubt that.
Thank you.

00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:32,112
And the idea that you
carried forward a salary

00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:33,780
that you thought
you should've gotten

00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,450
based on the work
you already put in.

00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:36,917
Right.

00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:38,652
But do you know how hard
that would be for an investor

00:18:38,652 --> 00:18:40,053
to watch you write yourself
a check

00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:41,588
for work that happened
two years ago

00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:43,790
against the money
that was given

00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,992
to the business
by the investor?

00:18:44,992 --> 00:18:46,860
They would hate you.

00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,061
Okay.

00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:48,862
So, are you in or are you out,
Barbara?

00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:51,198
I'm definitely out.

00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:52,733
Okay.
Thank you, Barbara.

00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:55,903
What percentage of people
does this not work on?

00:18:55,903 --> 00:18:58,839
Acupressure, there's
an individualized response,

00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:01,708
so I can't tell you how many
it does or does not work for.

00:19:03,177 --> 00:19:03,710
You're my biggest critics.

00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,113
I'm already receiving
the cynicism,

00:19:06,113 --> 00:19:06,647
but I can vouch
for the fact

00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:09,316
that we have $1 million
in sales.

00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,852
There's a lot of things
that sell that don't work.

00:19:12,786 --> 00:19:14,922
But, mark, why do you
have a problem with it?

00:19:14,922 --> 00:19:17,658
You're basically
resolving a problem

00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:21,662
that is crushing people around
the world on an ongoing basis,

00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:24,398
yet you really don't have
any r&amp;d,

00:19:24,398 --> 00:19:26,133
and you don't have
any Ongoing r&amp;d.

00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:28,468
You understand why I'm very,
very skeptical of this product.

00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:30,904
We would not be able to make
the medical claims that we do

00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:32,573
if it weren't
for our fda clearance.

00:19:32,573 --> 00:19:34,708
No, but you're avoiding
the actual claims.

00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,443
You're saying
it helps with.

00:19:36,443 --> 00:19:37,978
Placebos help with.
It relieves --

00:19:37,978 --> 00:19:40,714
'cause I cannot make the claim
that This is gonna help

00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:42,849
100% of the people
100% of the time.

00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:46,453
I can only tell you that
acupressure relieves nausea.

00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:50,324
I understand you believe,
but that doesn't make it real.

00:19:50,324 --> 00:19:51,325
I'm out.

00:19:51,325 --> 00:19:53,327
Okay.

00:19:53,327 --> 00:19:55,395
Hey, romy.
Here's where I stand.

00:19:55,395 --> 00:20:00,467
I have no problem
with the pursuit of profit.

00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:01,468
You can stand up there,

00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:05,305
and you can try
to sell me whatever you want.

00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:07,374
And I don't have any problem
with that...

00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:10,367
until you tell me
it helps people with cancer.

00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,502
I understand.
It's a very emotional thing.

00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:17,667
Every bit of my being cringes
when you say that.

00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:18,668
I'm out.

00:20:18,668 --> 00:20:19,535
Okay.

00:20:19,535 --> 00:20:20,870
O'Leary: Daymond?

00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:23,072
John: Well, romy. Hmm.

00:20:23,072 --> 00:20:24,940
I don't know if you're selling
Snake oil or not.

00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,810
I actually tend to believe
in these things

00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,278
because I do a lot of fishing,
and I get nauseous.

00:20:29,278 --> 00:20:32,548
I mean, huge, right?
Right. Yes. Yes.

00:20:32,548 --> 00:20:34,350
So, I was
believing in you,

00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,786
but you said to me
when you came out

00:20:36,786 --> 00:20:39,722
the company is profitable,
number one.

00:20:39,722 --> 00:20:41,390
It's not profitable
if it has debt

00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,992
and it's not paying down
the debt.

00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,661
It's not the black.

00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,129
I just don't think
I trust you.

00:20:47,129 --> 00:20:48,798
That's the bigger problem.

00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:50,933
I'm a very, very trustworthy
person, daymond.

00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:52,334
You might be,

00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:56,033
but today, your presentation
made me a little woozy.

00:20:56,033 --> 00:20:57,234
I'm out.

00:20:57,234 --> 00:20:58,035
Okay. Thank you.

00:20:58,035 --> 00:21:00,437
I will do you a favor

00:21:00,437 --> 00:21:02,573
because I think
your business has revenue.

00:21:02,573 --> 00:21:02,706
I think it's growing.

00:21:02,706 --> 00:21:05,442
Let me make you an offer,
okay?

00:21:05,442 --> 00:21:07,644
I'm going to
give you $250,000

00:21:07,644 --> 00:21:10,547
for 40% of your company,
all right?

00:21:10,547 --> 00:21:12,683
Basically, about six times
your cash flow.

00:21:12,683 --> 00:21:14,351
That's what it's worth.

00:21:14,351 --> 00:21:15,352
Please say yes.

00:21:15,352 --> 00:21:17,488
Taormina: No.
Why not?

00:21:17,488 --> 00:21:19,490
I just believe
I'm gonna take this company

00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:20,023
so much further than that.

00:21:20,023 --> 00:21:24,027
I really stand firm
on the 10% for the $250,000.

00:21:24,027 --> 00:21:25,963
I feel like it's very,
very reasonable and fair.

00:21:25,963 --> 00:21:27,764
Do you want some time
to consider that offer?

00:21:27,764 --> 00:21:30,167
No. Thank you, though,
for the offer.

00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:31,635
Do you want
to counter it?

00:21:31,635 --> 00:21:32,836
I have a small amount
of flexibility.

00:21:32,836 --> 00:21:34,171
We're very far off.

00:21:36,106 --> 00:21:38,175
No investor will ever
give you that.

00:21:38,175 --> 00:21:39,710
Never.
Okay.

00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,845
They'll go through
the same analysis I just did

00:21:41,845 --> 00:21:44,815
and say you're very greedy,
and you're way overvalued.

00:21:44,815 --> 00:21:46,416
I'm not giving away
40% of my company.

00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,418
You're dead to me.

00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:51,488
I'm out.

00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,624
Okay. Thank you.

00:21:56,827 --> 00:21:59,830
They are sharks.
They will bite your head off.

00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:02,566
When they don't believe in
something, they just go for it.

00:22:02,566 --> 00:22:04,234
And I stand behind my product

00:22:04,234 --> 00:22:08,038
and what it's doing for those
who suffer from nausea.

00:22:18,849 --> 00:22:21,919
Narrator: Next up are
Nick Gonzales and Kevin Mack

00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,722
with a new solution to
an otherwise permanent problem.

00:22:28,767 --> 00:22:30,166
Hey, sharks.
I'm Nick Gonzales.

00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,235
And I'm Kevin Mack
here with neo innovations,

00:22:32,235 --> 00:22:34,370
and we're currently seeking
$80,000

00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:37,173
in exchange for 20% equity
in our company.

00:22:37,173 --> 00:22:40,043
There are
over 150,000 new Tattoos

00:22:40,043 --> 00:22:41,978
being put on by Amateur
tattoo artists every month,

00:22:41,978 --> 00:22:45,048
and half of those are gonna
suffer from tattoo regret.

00:22:45,048 --> 00:22:46,716
That terrible feeling you get
after a tattoo

00:22:46,716 --> 00:22:48,918
that you thought
was a good idea at the time

00:22:48,918 --> 00:22:50,620
but ended up
to be the worst.

00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,888
Well, finally,
there's an affordable method

00:22:51,888 --> 00:22:53,423
of tattoo removal.

00:22:53,423 --> 00:22:55,892
Black magic ipl is
an intense-Pulse light device

00:22:55,892 --> 00:22:57,360
that uses light energy

00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,229
to break up the dark pigments
in tattoo inks.

00:22:59,229 --> 00:22:59,362
It breaks them up

00:22:59,362 --> 00:23:01,764
without breaking
the surface of the skin.

00:23:01,764 --> 00:23:05,034
Black magic ipl provides
affordable tattoo removal

00:23:05,034 --> 00:23:06,502
for less
than one laser treatment.

00:23:06,502 --> 00:23:07,704
It's so easy...

00:23:07,704 --> 00:23:09,239
BOTH:
Anyone can do it.

00:23:09,239 --> 00:23:10,567
Here's how it works.

00:23:11,174 --> 00:23:13,643
Place the tip of the device on
the area that you want to treat

00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:14,711
and pulse
one to three times,

00:23:14,711 --> 00:23:16,846
moving forward
one-Quarter inch at a time.

00:23:16,846 --> 00:23:18,982
The tattoo will then fade
in quarter-Inch spots

00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:21,317
a few weeks
after treatment.

00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:23,253
Herjavec: Do you have
any example of your skin

00:23:23,253 --> 00:23:24,554
that where you did remove
a tattoo,

00:23:24,554 --> 00:23:26,089
what it looked like?
Can I show you?

00:23:26,089 --> 00:23:27,156
Yeah.
Okay.

00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:31,094
So, this is
just one treatment.

00:23:31,094 --> 00:23:31,628
Come on.
Yep.

00:23:31,628 --> 00:23:34,297
So, you're saying
Those white Holes

00:23:34,297 --> 00:23:35,431
are just
from one treatment?

00:23:35,431 --> 00:23:36,766
One treatment.

00:23:36,766 --> 00:23:39,168
Mack: Sharks,
here I have two balloons.

00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:41,237
This balloon
is gonna represent

00:23:41,237 --> 00:23:42,772
tattoo-Ink cells
underneath the skin,

00:23:42,772 --> 00:23:44,240
while this balloon's
gonna represent

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,776
the skin on top
or around the tattoo.

00:23:46,776 --> 00:23:47,977
As you can see,

00:23:47,977 --> 00:23:50,513
when I pulse
or even hold on this balloon,

00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:52,181
it is not affected
by the light

00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:54,050
because there is
no dark pigments

00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:55,385
to collect
the light energy.

00:23:55,385 --> 00:23:57,887
But when I pulse on the balloon
with dark pigments...

00:23:57,887 --> 00:23:59,756
it pops instantly.

00:23:59,756 --> 00:24:00,757
So, sharks,

00:24:00,757 --> 00:24:04,160
who wants to jump on board
with neo innovations...

00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,895
BOTH:
And help us light the way?

00:24:05,895 --> 00:24:06,696
[ laughter ]

00:24:09,098 --> 00:24:10,099
I got a question.

00:24:10,099 --> 00:24:11,634
Mm-hmm.

00:24:11,634 --> 00:24:14,304
I'm black. Will I explode
if I put that on me?

00:24:14,304 --> 00:24:14,504
[ laughter ]
Very good question.

00:24:14,504 --> 00:24:17,173
There's
a scaled-Down version

00:24:17,173 --> 00:24:18,708
where you can put
the slider control way down.

00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:19,909
3 Watt
on up to 50 Watts,

00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:21,244
so you could, you know,

00:24:21,244 --> 00:24:22,312
treat depending on
the darkness of your tattoo

00:24:22,312 --> 00:24:24,314
and what type of ink
is on your body.

00:24:24,314 --> 00:24:25,848
You're expecting
the average person to understand

00:24:25,848 --> 00:24:28,184
what wattage
they should Dial in

00:24:28,184 --> 00:24:29,652
and then start
zapping their skin?

00:24:29,652 --> 00:24:31,154
No, but it's very --

00:24:31,154 --> 00:24:33,823
think there's any chance
people are gonna fry themselves?

00:24:33,823 --> 00:24:35,291
No.

00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:37,627
Wait.
This is for home use?
Home use. Yes.

00:24:37,627 --> 00:24:38,628
Herjavec:
Oh, I didn't get that.

00:24:38,628 --> 00:24:40,496
I thought
this had to be regulated

00:24:40,496 --> 00:24:43,032
by somebody
who's licensed to treat you.

00:24:43,032 --> 00:24:43,900
Our device
is nonablative,

00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,436
which means that it does not
Pierce the layers of skin.

00:24:46,436 --> 00:24:48,838
Laser treatment
doesn't Pierce the skin.

00:24:48,838 --> 00:24:49,839
It pierces
through the top layer of skin.

00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:51,774
But is this safe?

00:24:51,774 --> 00:24:52,842
Yes.

00:24:52,842 --> 00:24:54,577
It is safe. Yes.

00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:55,511
O'Leary:
So, you send it home.

00:24:55,511 --> 00:24:57,380
"honey,
the tattoo remover's arrived."

00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:00,049
Minutes later,
the ambulance pulls up.

00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:01,918
No.
Absolutely not.

00:25:01,918 --> 00:25:04,220
How did you get there?
What's your background?

00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:04,754
Gonzales:
I owned a tattoo shop.

00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:07,623
Had more customers coming in
for tattoo cover-Ups

00:25:07,623 --> 00:25:09,025
and asking
about tattoo removal.

00:25:09,025 --> 00:25:11,160
What about the science?

00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,161
Intense-Pulse light
has been around

00:25:12,161 --> 00:25:14,430
and fda-Approved
since the '60s, so...
forever. Yeah.

00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,832
O'Leary: Is it a diode
that provides the light?

00:25:15,832 --> 00:25:17,967
No.
It's just a 50-Watt bulb.

00:25:17,967 --> 00:25:19,969
50-Watt bulb?
50 Watts. Yeah.

00:25:19,969 --> 00:25:21,637
That's it?
That's it. 50 Watt.

00:25:23,633 --> 00:25:25,035
So, educate me.

00:25:25,035 --> 00:25:26,970
You said This light
has been around forever.

00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:28,772
Does anybody else use it
for this purpose?
Nope.

00:25:28,772 --> 00:25:30,507
Not with
the neodymium ring magnet.

00:25:30,507 --> 00:25:32,442
Most tattoo inks
are very magnetic

00:25:32,442 --> 00:25:33,443
because of
the iron oxide content.

00:25:33,443 --> 00:25:34,911
Not many people
know that.

00:25:34,911 --> 00:25:36,479
So, you just dreamt it up
one day --

00:25:36,479 --> 00:25:38,148
"I'm gonna shoot this guy
with a light bulb,

00:25:38,148 --> 00:25:39,749
and his tattoo's
gonna go away"?

00:25:39,749 --> 00:25:41,551
"I'm gonna put the laser
business out of business."

00:25:41,551 --> 00:25:42,752
Exactly.

00:25:42,752 --> 00:25:44,087
It's evidence-Based.

00:25:44,087 --> 00:25:44,688
Light treatments are
the most effective way

00:25:44,688 --> 00:25:45,822
to remove a tattoo.

00:25:45,822 --> 00:25:48,958
So, is there
any home-Based competition?

00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:52,696
There's a couple of other
home tattoo-Removal systems,

00:25:52,696 --> 00:25:53,897
but they're
thousands of dollars.

00:25:53,897 --> 00:25:55,765
Is that bulb hot
to the touch?

00:25:55,765 --> 00:25:57,901
There is a little bit
of discomfort.

00:25:59,569 --> 00:26:00,570
What are your sales?

00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:02,505
Current sales --
Right now,

00:26:02,505 --> 00:26:04,574
we keep them
at about one to two a day,

00:26:04,574 --> 00:26:06,976
so that's about 30 to 40
a month.

00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:09,579
How do those 30 people find you
every month?

00:26:09,579 --> 00:26:11,500
Right now,
just amazon and ebay.
Yep.

00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,768
How long
have you been doing this?

00:26:12,768 --> 00:26:15,036
We've been doing it
for about a year and a half.

00:26:15,036 --> 00:26:16,638
How much have you sold
in the last year?

00:26:16,638 --> 00:26:17,839
700 units
the first year,

00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:18,907
and we're --
about 1,200 units total.

00:26:18,907 --> 00:26:20,976
1,200 units. How much
do the units retail for?

00:26:20,976 --> 00:26:22,778
$139.99.

00:26:22,778 --> 00:26:24,780
We've sold them
up to $300.

00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,849
You believe you're gonna do
$200,000 in sales This year?

00:26:27,849 --> 00:26:29,050
Most definitely.

00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,118
The more we market,
the more we sell.

00:26:30,118 --> 00:26:31,720
2% to 3% convergence rate,

00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,256
whether it be on amazon,
ebay, or the website.

00:26:35,524 --> 00:26:37,192
How easy is it to use?

00:26:37,192 --> 00:26:37,993
It's pretty much
point and shoot.

00:26:37,993 --> 00:26:39,728
You're saying
it's so easy,

00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:42,063
I can just use it on myself,
and it won't hurt me?

00:26:42,063 --> 00:26:43,498
No. Absolutely not.
No.

00:26:43,498 --> 00:26:45,967
How many times
do I have to do it on myself

00:26:45,967 --> 00:26:47,836
to get rid
of a tattoo like that?

00:26:47,836 --> 00:26:50,839
If I did this whole tattoo
all at once,

00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:53,108
it would be
90% to 100% removed.

00:26:53,108 --> 00:26:55,310
You're saying
in one treatment,

00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:58,046
I can get rid
of 90% of that tattoo?

00:26:58,046 --> 00:26:59,447
My immune system's
fairly healthy.

00:26:59,447 --> 00:27:00,649
I work out.
I drink a lot of water.

00:27:00,649 --> 00:27:01,516
I don't drink alcohol.
I don't smoke.

00:27:01,516 --> 00:27:04,653
So it's gonna be really quick
for people that are healthy.

00:27:05,854 --> 00:27:07,255
Corcoran: Sorry, guys.

00:27:07,255 --> 00:27:09,257
I'm just having
a very hard time

00:27:09,257 --> 00:27:10,192
with the safety aspect
of this.

00:27:10,192 --> 00:27:11,860
Is it fda approved?

00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,795
Both:
The process is fda approved.

00:27:13,795 --> 00:27:15,964
You've taken and applied
for an fda approval

00:27:15,964 --> 00:27:17,966
for the process
and submitted your device?

00:27:17,966 --> 00:27:19,701
And that's
where we're at now.

00:27:19,701 --> 00:27:21,570
The fda approval firms
that we talked to

00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:23,839
said it can cost
between $20,000 and $100,000,

00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:26,700
and that's primarily what
we would use that money for.

00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,400
And you're allowed to sell them
before the approval?

00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,267
Yeah.
They said, "you're fine."

00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:34,405
I'm having a hard time
believing this. Sorry.

00:27:35,673 --> 00:27:37,141
I'm out.

00:27:39,276 --> 00:27:40,477
Huge market.

00:27:40,477 --> 00:27:41,078
Billions of dollars.
Absolutely. Yeah.

00:27:41,078 --> 00:27:43,080
Huge demand.
It's not just
the tattoo removal.

00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,549
You know,
it's the pigment disorders.

00:27:45,549 --> 00:27:49,220
Guys,
I actually love the idea,

00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:52,590
but I get sued for the craziest,
craziest stuff ever.

00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,325
I'm just a target.

00:27:54,325 --> 00:27:56,994
And so I just can't
take that risk.

00:27:56,994 --> 00:27:58,596
So for that reason,
I'm out.

00:28:00,397 --> 00:28:03,734
Well, if I can counter that,
this is not something new.

00:28:03,734 --> 00:28:05,269
This has been around
for decades.

00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:06,203
No, I get that.
I get that, right?

00:28:06,203 --> 00:28:08,939
But that doesn't make me
any less of a target.

00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:11,075
You know, Kevin, the reason
you're not gonna get sued today

00:28:11,075 --> 00:28:13,410
is you're two tattoo guys.

00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:15,145
The minute I come in,

00:28:15,145 --> 00:28:18,415
they say,
"ah, there's a shark involved.

00:28:18,415 --> 00:28:20,618
Forget those two guys.
Let's Sue him."

00:28:20,618 --> 00:28:24,521
So, being able
to get a device -- Any device --

00:28:24,521 --> 00:28:25,990
Combustion engine, anything
that deals with electricity,

00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:27,258
they're all dangerous
to buy.

00:28:27,258 --> 00:28:28,926
So, there's ways
to get it protected

00:28:28,926 --> 00:28:30,461
and make it where it's safe.
I don't disagree with you.

00:28:30,461 --> 00:28:32,329
I can't get involved.
I'm out.

00:28:34,932 --> 00:28:36,400
We do have
liability release forms

00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,868
at the point of purchase.

00:28:37,868 --> 00:28:39,336
All it takes
is one idiot to Sue you.

00:28:39,336 --> 00:28:41,205
You don't have to have
a legitimate reason.

00:28:41,205 --> 00:28:44,541
So, mark's out,
Barbara's out, I'm out.

00:28:44,541 --> 00:28:45,209
Daymond, Kevin?

00:28:47,344 --> 00:28:50,281
Well, I actually like
the business,

00:28:50,281 --> 00:28:52,149
because I think
that's what you're building

00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:53,550
is a business
for removing tattoos.

00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,019
The numbers are great.

00:28:55,019 --> 00:28:57,821
Liability is the issue.

00:28:57,821 --> 00:29:00,724
It only takes one lawsuit,
which is such a headache.

00:29:00,724 --> 00:29:04,328
And I can't
get around that.

00:29:04,328 --> 00:29:05,863
I'm out.

00:29:10,601 --> 00:29:15,072
You're coming
without the fda approval.

00:29:15,072 --> 00:29:18,409
You know,
a kid gets ahold of this thing

00:29:18,409 --> 00:29:19,610
and burns
his little brother's eye out.

00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:21,412
And there's an easy fix
with that.

00:29:21,412 --> 00:29:22,212
There's
just a little key switch,

00:29:22,212 --> 00:29:24,214
on and off,
where the key --

00:29:24,214 --> 00:29:26,150
You know,
there's protective functions

00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:27,618
to be able
to stop all that.

00:29:28,218 --> 00:29:29,219
I'm out.

00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:35,592
Corcoran:
So, the lesson there

00:29:35,592 --> 00:29:36,994
is stay poor,
and you won't get sued.

00:29:36,994 --> 00:29:39,263
Cuban: You won't get sued.
Thanks, guys.

00:29:39,263 --> 00:29:41,065
Thank you, sharks.
John: Thank you.
Good luck.

00:29:43,467 --> 00:29:45,602
Mack:
This is a major industry,

00:29:45,602 --> 00:29:49,740
and to just look over something
just because of litigation,

00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,874
you know, it's...

00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:53,344
[ scoffs ]
speechless.

00:29:53,344 --> 00:29:54,678
[ both chuckle ]

00:30:05,422 --> 00:30:06,423
HAYNES:
My name is Jessica Haynes,

00:30:06,423 --> 00:30:09,493
and I'm from the small town
of Emerson, arkansas.

00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:13,066
Growing up in a small town
is great.

00:30:13,066 --> 00:30:16,603
Everyone is like family,
and family is important to me.

00:30:16,603 --> 00:30:18,338
I wouldn't be where I am today
without them.

00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,408
My family is very fun.

00:30:21,408 --> 00:30:24,611
We love being outdoors
and doing things together.

00:30:24,611 --> 00:30:25,745
My family is part of who I am.

00:30:25,745 --> 00:30:29,749
They give me the confidence
to make crazy, risky decisions

00:30:29,749 --> 00:30:31,084
like starting my own company.

00:30:31,084 --> 00:30:34,020
Cheers
to family dinners on Sunday.

00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,422
Yay.
Cheers.

00:30:35,422 --> 00:30:37,023
My product is
a fashion accessory

00:30:37,023 --> 00:30:39,459
that allows women
to transform their outfit

00:30:39,459 --> 00:30:41,394
to match any occasion.

00:30:41,394 --> 00:30:43,463
Okay, so it should be
mid next week?

00:30:43,463 --> 00:30:46,533
My business is in the start-up
phase with only a prototype.

00:30:46,533 --> 00:30:48,001
I'm trying
to secure an investment

00:30:48,001 --> 00:30:50,003
so I can move forward
with manufacturing

00:30:50,003 --> 00:30:52,005
and start selling my product.

00:30:52,005 --> 00:30:53,740
I've been turned down
by countless investors.

00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,475
The sharks are my last hope.

00:31:11,233 --> 00:31:13,035
Hey, y'all.

00:31:13,035 --> 00:31:15,837
My name is Jessica Haynes,
creator of jeska shoe company.

00:31:15,837 --> 00:31:18,707
I'm asking for $70,000

00:31:18,707 --> 00:31:22,244
in exchange for a 30% stake
in my company.

00:31:22,244 --> 00:31:24,579
I've created a product

00:31:24,579 --> 00:31:27,182
that allows women to change
the look of their shoes

00:31:27,182 --> 00:31:31,586
as easily and as often
as we change our mind.

00:31:31,586 --> 00:31:33,255
Imagine a seven-Day vacation.

00:31:33,255 --> 00:31:37,926
This is just a lady's shoe bag,
and for you, gentlemen,

00:31:37,926 --> 00:31:40,595
that means you're lugging
this precious cargo

00:31:40,595 --> 00:31:43,732
half a mile
through the airport.

00:31:43,732 --> 00:31:47,102
Now, imagine if you can sell
that same woman

00:31:47,102 --> 00:31:50,367
one pair of shoes that would
match all of her outfits --

00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:54,533
Business, casual,
and even special occasions.

00:31:54,533 --> 00:31:56,869
That would be a shoe
that would sell itself.

00:31:58,137 --> 00:32:00,072
The jeska high-Heeled shoe

00:32:00,072 --> 00:32:02,941
allows women to change
the look of their shoes

00:32:02,941 --> 00:32:04,810
from a stiletto to a wedge

00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:08,480
with a simple push,
slide, and snap.

00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,418
By releasing the safety catch,
the heel can be slid off,

00:32:12,418 --> 00:32:14,686
and another heel can be slid
in its place.

00:32:14,686 --> 00:32:16,155
It's that easy.

00:32:16,155 --> 00:32:17,156
Wow.

00:32:17,156 --> 00:32:19,124
With hidden
magnetic components

00:32:19,124 --> 00:32:23,262
and a built-In mechanism
for interchanging heels,

00:32:23,262 --> 00:32:25,597
our product offers women
a canvas

00:32:25,597 --> 00:32:27,599
they can continually update
and change.

00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:29,668
And with your help,

00:32:29,668 --> 00:32:32,337
we can bring this product
to the masses.

00:32:32,337 --> 00:32:35,074
Cinderella's proof
that one pair of shoes

00:32:35,074 --> 00:32:37,009
can change your life.

00:32:37,009 --> 00:32:38,410
Great idea.

00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,411
Thank you.

00:32:39,411 --> 00:32:40,879
John: What kind of sales
do you have

00:32:40,879 --> 00:32:42,214
on the Mr. Potato head
for stilettos?

00:32:42,214 --> 00:32:44,483
[ laughs ]
that's very funny.

00:32:44,483 --> 00:32:46,218
I do not have any sales
right now.

00:32:46,218 --> 00:32:48,020
We're still
in the prototype phase.

00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,955
May I see that shoe?

00:32:49,955 --> 00:32:51,924
Yes, ma'am.

00:32:53,525 --> 00:32:55,794
You're not the first
to actually design a shoe

00:32:55,794 --> 00:32:57,863
with a detachable heel
for women.

00:32:57,863 --> 00:32:59,064
You're right.

00:32:59,064 --> 00:33:02,401
The first patent was filed
in 1899.

00:33:02,801 --> 00:33:05,537
Why haven't I seen it
in shoe stores?

00:33:05,537 --> 00:33:06,872
We have seen
other products

00:33:06,872 --> 00:33:08,674
that allow women
to transform their shoes.

00:33:08,674 --> 00:33:12,010
I think people just haven't
partnered with the right people

00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:13,145
and made
the right connections

00:33:13,145 --> 00:33:14,746
in order to get it out
to the market.

00:33:14,746 --> 00:33:16,615
But, Jessica,
there's another thesis here,

00:33:16,615 --> 00:33:17,816
and it goes like this.

00:33:17,816 --> 00:33:20,152
Shoe companies have
no vested interest

00:33:20,152 --> 00:33:22,421
in reducing
the number of pairs they sell

00:33:22,421 --> 00:33:24,223
by making
the heels interchangeable.

00:33:24,223 --> 00:33:27,526
That does not help them
sell more shoes.

00:33:27,526 --> 00:33:30,796
That's why the shoe companies
have not embraced this idea.

00:33:30,796 --> 00:33:33,465
Cuban: You have
all these other shoe companies

00:33:33,465 --> 00:33:36,135
that are spending
millions and millions of dollars

00:33:36,135 --> 00:33:38,070
to let women know
that they exist.

00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:41,006
How are you gonna stand out
so that people can find you?

00:33:41,006 --> 00:33:42,608
I think
the way that we stand out

00:33:42,608 --> 00:33:45,667
is licensing this technology
to an existing brand.

00:33:45,667 --> 00:33:46,812
It's a huge industry.

00:33:46,812 --> 00:33:49,281
You're a tiny, little
shoe cockroach in it.

00:33:50,415 --> 00:33:51,633
You're scurrying around
in the dark,

00:33:51,633 --> 00:33:53,635
trying to get some exposure
for this.

00:33:53,635 --> 00:33:55,771
To actually compete
with the giant shoe companies,

00:33:55,771 --> 00:33:57,472
do you think
that's gonna be easy?

00:33:57,472 --> 00:34:00,008
I don't think
it's gonna be easy.

00:34:00,008 --> 00:34:02,878
I don't think anything anyone
ever does in business is easy,

00:34:02,878 --> 00:34:04,079
but I do think
it's possible.

00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:05,547
What are you gonna
sell these for?

00:34:05,547 --> 00:34:09,417
Right now, it is estimated
to be sold at $200 retail.

00:34:09,417 --> 00:34:10,552
Whoa.

00:34:10,552 --> 00:34:12,554
Do you have a patent
on that?

00:34:12,554 --> 00:34:13,955
It is patent pending, yes.

00:34:13,955 --> 00:34:15,367
What's the patent on?

00:34:15,367 --> 00:34:16,224
It is for the magnets

00:34:16,224 --> 00:34:18,293
and the interchangeable-Heel
concept.

00:34:18,293 --> 00:34:21,897
You're giving us prices,
and you haven't made any.

00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,868
Forget even selling.
Mm-hmm.

00:34:25,868 --> 00:34:30,005
How do you know
the prices on this shoe?

00:34:30,005 --> 00:34:32,842
I'm currently working
with a manufacturer overseas.

00:34:32,842 --> 00:34:35,177
Okay.
And we are
in pre-Production.

00:34:35,177 --> 00:34:37,113
They're right now building
the equipment

00:34:37,113 --> 00:34:39,715
that is necessary
to manufacture this product.

00:34:39,715 --> 00:34:42,384
Do you have any of your own
money invested into this?

00:34:42,384 --> 00:34:43,652
I do.
I have a lot of my own money.

00:34:43,652 --> 00:34:44,520
How much is it?
How much?

00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,190
$63,000.

00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,926
Where did you get
the $63,000 from?

00:34:50,926 --> 00:34:52,862
When I was a young girl,
my grandfather smoked cigars,

00:34:52,862 --> 00:34:55,197
and I made an agreement
with him.

00:34:55,197 --> 00:34:56,799
"grandpa,
if you stop smoking cigars,

00:34:56,799 --> 00:34:59,602
I promise
I'm gonna do good in school."

00:34:59,602 --> 00:35:01,470
[ chuckles ]

00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:04,473
so, he believed me, and he
set aside a college fund for me,

00:35:04,473 --> 00:35:06,775
and he said,
"Okay, for every craving I get

00:35:06,775 --> 00:35:09,178
"or every amount
that I would spend on cigars,

00:35:09,178 --> 00:35:10,713
"I'll put it
into a college account

00:35:10,713 --> 00:35:12,848
for you to use
whenever you go to college."

00:35:12,848 --> 00:35:15,451
Nice grandpa.
Yes.

00:35:15,451 --> 00:35:16,986
And then,
when I went to college,

00:35:16,986 --> 00:35:18,988
I had scholarships based
on the grades that I got,

00:35:18,988 --> 00:35:21,056
so I never actually
touched the money.

00:35:21,056 --> 00:35:23,325
Whenever I graduated
with my masters,

00:35:23,325 --> 00:35:25,127
I called my grandpa,
and I said,

00:35:25,127 --> 00:35:26,996
"grandpa,
I have this crazy idea.

00:35:26,996 --> 00:35:28,797
I want
to start a shoe company."

00:35:28,797 --> 00:35:30,266
[ chuckles ]

00:35:30,266 --> 00:35:31,800
and he said,
"I'm an entrepreneur myself,

00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,270
and I would love for you
to follow in my footsteps."

00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:36,405
He said, "Jessica,
if you don't take a risk,

00:35:36,405 --> 00:35:37,706
you never get the reward."

00:35:37,706 --> 00:35:41,443
And so that's when I used
all of that money

00:35:41,443 --> 00:35:42,778
to go towards the company.

00:35:42,778 --> 00:35:44,046
Eventually, that ran out.

00:35:44,046 --> 00:35:46,248
Starting a business

00:35:46,248 --> 00:35:48,517
I never would have thought
was so expensive.

00:35:48,517 --> 00:35:50,653
A couple months ago,
I was at a crossroads.

00:35:50,653 --> 00:35:52,855
I needed more money,
but I couldn't get it.

00:35:52,855 --> 00:35:54,857
And so I actually went
to the person

00:35:54,857 --> 00:35:57,593
that could never tell me no --
My parents.

00:35:57,593 --> 00:36:00,196
Oh, I know this story.

00:36:00,196 --> 00:36:02,131
They took a second mortgage out
on their home.

00:36:03,933 --> 00:36:06,202
Were you okay with that?

00:36:06,202 --> 00:36:07,536
[ Voice breaking ]
it was very hard

00:36:07,536 --> 00:36:09,738
to have my parents
take that risk.

00:36:09,738 --> 00:36:13,108
It was one thing to risk
my financial savings.

00:36:14,043 --> 00:36:18,047
But it was very hard to put
my family in that situation.

00:36:20,182 --> 00:36:22,451
I also --
I work full time,

00:36:22,451 --> 00:36:26,855
and I put every dollar
that I earn into this company.

00:36:26,855 --> 00:36:28,924
My mother did the same
for me.

00:36:28,924 --> 00:36:30,659
I knew
that you could relate to that.

00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:32,461
I got turned down
by 27 banks.

00:36:32,461 --> 00:36:34,396
Mm-hmm.

00:36:34,396 --> 00:36:34,863
My mother
put up the house,

00:36:34,863 --> 00:36:36,665
and I moved sewing machines
in the house.

00:36:36,665 --> 00:36:38,934
I made a factory
in the middle of Hollis, queens.

00:36:38,934 --> 00:36:41,737
No matter how hard things got
for me,

00:36:41,737 --> 00:36:43,272
I could never
go to my parents

00:36:43,272 --> 00:36:45,140
because I couldn't wake up
the next day

00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,575
with that pressure
on my shoulders.

00:36:46,575 --> 00:36:48,310
Well,
you're very fortunate

00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:49,511
that you have parents
that love you that much.

00:36:49,511 --> 00:36:51,046
Yes, I do very much.

00:36:51,046 --> 00:36:53,382
Here's the part
that I'm struggling with.

00:36:53,382 --> 00:36:56,518
Perhaps the reason
this isn't out there --

00:36:56,518 --> 00:37:00,856
Maybe women like
changing shoes.

00:37:00,856 --> 00:37:04,460
There's also another product
out there

00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:08,264
that offers women the ability
to change their accessories

00:37:08,264 --> 00:37:09,865
using a snap on the toe.

00:37:09,865 --> 00:37:12,001
It's a ballet flat
that they do it on.

00:37:12,001 --> 00:37:16,338
And this company had $16 million
in sales in 2009.

00:37:16,338 --> 00:37:18,507
So, Jessica, why don't you
focus on the one attribute

00:37:18,507 --> 00:37:20,576
to your deal
that you haven't addressed

00:37:20,576 --> 00:37:23,245
and maybe the reason
you failed --

00:37:23,245 --> 00:37:25,180
How are you going to
get distribution?

00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:28,584
The plan is that --
I don't have all the answers.

00:37:28,584 --> 00:37:29,918
That's the plan?

00:37:29,918 --> 00:37:32,254
I'm not here telling you
that I have all the answers

00:37:32,254 --> 00:37:33,856
because that would be
a lie.

00:37:33,856 --> 00:37:35,324
Clearly,
you don't have a plan.

00:37:36,992 --> 00:37:38,127
And for that reason,
I'm out.

00:37:38,127 --> 00:37:41,463
[ sighs ]

00:37:43,198 --> 00:37:43,999
Jessica, I'm gonna make it
a little bit easier.

00:37:43,999 --> 00:37:46,735
I just don't know anything
about the business,

00:37:46,735 --> 00:37:48,404
so partnering with me
isn't gonna help you.

00:37:48,404 --> 00:37:51,006
I have no idea.

00:37:51,006 --> 00:37:53,042
I mean, I stopped wearing
shoes like that a long time ago.

00:37:53,042 --> 00:37:54,777
[ laughs ]

00:37:54,777 --> 00:37:56,445
but I'm out.

00:37:56,445 --> 00:37:58,113
Thank you.

00:37:58,113 --> 00:38:01,183
I have a price question.
Okay.

00:38:01,183 --> 00:38:03,719
So, you're gonna be selling this
shoe with one heel for $200.

00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:05,321
If you want a second heel,

00:38:05,321 --> 00:38:07,189
what's that consumer
gonna pay for it?

00:38:07,189 --> 00:38:09,792
Anywhere
between $20 and $30.

00:38:09,792 --> 00:38:11,527
Here's what I don't like
about your plan.

00:38:12,795 --> 00:38:15,130
You're asking someone,

00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:19,468
in the price point
of $200, $230 a pair of shoes,

00:38:19,468 --> 00:38:21,337
to buy your product.

00:38:21,337 --> 00:38:23,472
I think
those people are affluent enough

00:38:23,472 --> 00:38:24,673
to just buy two pairs
for the same price.

00:38:24,673 --> 00:38:26,175
Oh.

00:38:26,175 --> 00:38:27,242
And I just might add --

00:38:27,242 --> 00:38:29,778
My first business,
I lost $42,000.

00:38:29,778 --> 00:38:32,448
It was worth $1 billion
to me then.

00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:35,050
I failed miserably
after two years of trying,

00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:36,251
and you know what?

00:38:36,251 --> 00:38:36,852
I should have given up
after three months.

00:38:36,852 --> 00:38:38,253
I had a bad idea.

00:38:38,253 --> 00:38:41,056
But in giving up,
I got into the right business.

00:38:41,056 --> 00:38:42,524
I'm sure
there's a right business

00:38:42,524 --> 00:38:44,259
right out that door
for you,

00:38:44,259 --> 00:38:46,662
and I admire you,
your enthusiasm.

00:38:46,662 --> 00:38:48,063
Mm-Hmm.

00:38:48,063 --> 00:38:49,264
But I just couldn't invest,
so I'm out.

00:38:52,134 --> 00:38:57,539
Look, if attitude and drive
were the measures of success,

00:38:57,539 --> 00:38:59,842
you're gonna be
very, very well-Off one day.

00:39:03,312 --> 00:39:08,133
I just can't see the business
and how you get there,

00:39:08,133 --> 00:39:11,670
but I definitely know you're
gonna make it in something.

00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:14,139
Thank you very much.
That means a lot.

00:39:14,139 --> 00:39:16,475
I'm out for the shoes.

00:39:20,145 --> 00:39:23,281
I have a great idea.
I know I do.

00:39:23,281 --> 00:39:26,284
The interchangeable-Product
market is making millions,

00:39:26,284 --> 00:39:30,021
and I know this product
can do that, too.

00:39:45,737 --> 00:39:47,806
Narrator:
Four sharks are out.

00:39:47,806 --> 00:39:51,209
Daymond is Jessica's last chance
to make a deal.

00:39:51,209 --> 00:39:53,812
I have a great idea.
I know I do.

00:39:55,814 --> 00:39:58,617
The interchangeable-Product
market is making millions,

00:39:58,617 --> 00:40:02,554
and I know this product
can do that, too.

00:40:02,554 --> 00:40:06,992
I've been told, "no" --
Like you have -- So many times.

00:40:06,992 --> 00:40:08,860
So, "no," today Does not mean
the end of the road for me.

00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:12,397
You're very, very early,
don't have a patent,

00:40:12,397 --> 00:40:15,667
don't have a finished sample,
don't have experience.

00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:21,006
All you have is debt
and a lot of courage.

00:40:21,006 --> 00:40:22,407
[ laughs ] thank you.

00:40:22,407 --> 00:40:23,742
All right?

00:40:25,544 --> 00:40:27,679
[ Sniffles ]

00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:30,282
your parents believed in you.
My parents believed in me.

00:40:32,484 --> 00:40:34,953
And I think I'm gonna take
a Gamble and believe in you.

00:40:36,087 --> 00:40:38,623
Oh, thank god.

00:40:38,623 --> 00:40:41,193
[ laughs ]

00:40:41,193 --> 00:40:44,729
I'm gonna make an offer...

00:40:44,729 --> 00:40:46,064
but it's gonna sting.

00:40:46,064 --> 00:40:47,465
Okay.

00:40:47,465 --> 00:40:50,335
[ sniffles ]

00:40:50,335 --> 00:40:54,873
I will give you
$70,000...

00:40:59,077 --> 00:41:01,746
...for 70% of the company.

00:41:01,746 --> 00:41:02,480
Oh, god.

00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,481
Oh, come on.

00:41:03,481 --> 00:41:04,549
Daymond!

00:41:04,549 --> 00:41:06,084
Uh...

00:41:06,084 --> 00:41:09,221
I have to do this job
for her.

00:41:09,221 --> 00:41:13,592
Daymond,
you're making her an employee.

00:41:13,592 --> 00:41:15,126
Understand
what I'm offering you.

00:41:17,395 --> 00:41:21,466
I'm going to work
basically for you at this point.

00:41:21,466 --> 00:41:24,936
I'm gonna teach you
every single thing I know.

00:41:24,936 --> 00:41:27,539
I will do the distribution,
the shipping, the billing,

00:41:27,539 --> 00:41:28,206
all that stuff.

00:41:28,206 --> 00:41:32,811
$1 billion in orders comes in,
I'm gonna get it financed.

00:41:32,811 --> 00:41:33,945
Every "No" Gets you closer
to a "Yes."

00:41:33,945 --> 00:41:35,881
You're not done,
and you've got a long way to go.

00:41:35,881 --> 00:41:37,015
John: Absolutely.

00:41:37,015 --> 00:41:38,483
I believe
that you're gonna go

00:41:38,483 --> 00:41:39,284
and do this
with or without me,

00:41:39,284 --> 00:41:41,820
but I just know the work
that I have to put in,

00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:44,089
and I'm just really investing
in you at this point.

00:41:44,089 --> 00:41:44,856
Jessica,
what do you want to do?

00:41:52,397 --> 00:41:57,802
A small portion of a big thing
is a lot better

00:41:57,802 --> 00:41:59,938
than a big portion
of a small thing.

00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,742
So, I take your deal.

00:42:03,742 --> 00:42:04,943
All right! There you go.
See that?

00:42:04,943 --> 00:42:07,012
Wow.

00:42:07,012 --> 00:42:09,681
I got a lot of work
cut out for me.

00:42:09,681 --> 00:42:11,683
But I'm gonna be
willing to learn.

00:42:11,683 --> 00:42:13,351
All right.

00:42:14,552 --> 00:42:15,887

all of y'all's feedback.
