00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:07,500

from across the country

00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,033

hear a great idea,

using their own money...

00:00:20,777 --> 00:00:22,312

what I'm going to give you

must convince a shark

they're asking for,

depending on your city.

You're getting in
at $20 a head.

When you go to smaller towns,

00:03:41,442 --> 00:03:43,242

So, Heather, these aren't
birthday parties that I'm...
no.

So you go, and it's an event,

00:03:46,846 --> 00:03:49,649
and you advertise it
like anybody would anything.
It's a big event.

00:03:49,649 --> 00:03:50,917
You're party promoters
for kids, basically?

00:03:50,917 --> 00:03:52,785
That's right.
We have our club events,

00:03:52,785 --> 00:03:54,253

00:03:56,355 --> 00:03:57,890

it's completely child-proof.

00:04:00,026 --> 00:04:02,428

00:04:20,713 --> 00:04:23,649
350, and that's been
consistent throughout?
Yes.

Right, so--
(Robert) So how do I
find out about you?

00:04:25,718 --> 00:04:28,221
When we started
seven years ago,

00:04:28,221 --> 00:04:31,367

It's the power of moms.

00:04:32,235 --> 00:04:33,836

word-of-mouth

00:04:35,304 --> 00:04:37,573
we have hundreds of moms
across the country

00:04:37,573 --> 00:04:40,309
that love to come on board
on our team and work with us.

00:04:40,309 --> 00:04:41,711
How much money have you made
in the seven years?

00:04:41,711 --> 00:04:46,249
We have grossed
$2,800,000 in 7 years...
Whoa.

00:04:46,249 --> 00:04:47,850
With $2 million of that
being in the last 5.

00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,319
Wow.
What about
the last 12 months,

00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:52,255
and what about
the last one month?

00:04:52,255 --> 00:04:57,126
This year is going to be
a $525,000 year.

00:04:57,126 --> 00:04:58,728
Let me just set up
the big picture for a second--

00:04:58,728 --> 00:05:01,097
we spent the first two years
building the brand,

00:05:01,097 --> 00:05:02,698
spending more money
than we could make

00:05:02,698 --> 00:05:04,166
to get it from east coast
to west coast.

00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:07,103
We plant as an institution
in each of these cities.

00:05:07,103 --> 00:05:09,372
I go, I fly out,
I hire a mom, I train a mom,

00:05:09,372 --> 00:05:11,173
I train a crew.

00:05:11,173 --> 00:05:12,508
At our biggest
U.S. domestic spread

00:05:12,508 --> 00:05:16,579
of 33 cities,
we made $800,000,

00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:18,514
but we were under by $20,000.

00:05:18,514 --> 00:05:21,584
So you sold $800,000,
but you lost $20,000?

00:05:21,584 --> 00:05:23,586
Yes.

00:05:23,586 --> 00:05:27,256
This year, you think
you're gonna sell $500,000?

00:05:27,256 --> 00:05:29,258
What we haven't spoken to
is our amazing sponsorship.

00:05:29,258 --> 00:05:32,595
We have $425,000 alone
this year in sponsorship.

00:05:32,595 --> 00:05:33,963
Wait, Wait, wait, wait.

00:05:33,963 --> 00:05:37,633
So $425,000 of
your $525,000 in revenue

00:05:37,633 --> 00:05:38,434
is from a sponsor?

00:05:38,434 --> 00:05:41,370
We have to walk a fine line
between sales and sponsorship,

00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,973
because we--our sponsors
are sponsoring us

00:05:43,973 --> 00:05:45,174
to play for free.

00:05:45,174 --> 00:05:47,310
Why would I ever do
a free event?

00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,644
Kevin, hang on.
I'm still confused

00:05:48,644 --> 00:05:51,247
what the business
has evolved to today.

00:05:51,247 --> 00:05:52,448
While this was
all happening,

00:05:52,448 --> 00:05:54,784
we were approached
by major publishers.

00:05:54,784 --> 00:05:56,252
Penguin books said,
"can you put out some books--"

00:05:56,252 --> 00:05:57,853
you're dancing
around the question.

00:05:57,853 --> 00:05:59,188
Give me one advantage--
Let me be clear on this--

00:05:59,188 --> 00:06:01,257
the answer is,
at baby loves disco,

00:06:01,257 --> 00:06:01,857
we make money
from sponsorship,

00:06:01,857 --> 00:06:03,793
we make money
from ticket sales,

00:06:03,793 --> 00:06:05,861
and we make money
from merchandise.

00:06:05,861 --> 00:06:07,763
Give me an event,
just one Saturday afternoon.

00:06:07,763 --> 00:06:09,432
How much money do I make?

00:06:09,432 --> 00:06:11,767
We make
between $1,500 and $3,000

00:06:11,767 --> 00:06:13,169
on each individual event.

00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:14,770
How much will
the sales be next year?

00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:18,708
Next year, we're projecting
to make $750,000.

00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:19,642
What amount will come
from the shows,

00:06:19,642 --> 00:06:22,978
from sponsorship,
from the merchandise?

00:06:22,978 --> 00:06:25,247
Well, merchandise
is a question mark,

00:06:25,247 --> 00:06:26,048
but we project sponsorship
to be in the same league.

00:06:26,048 --> 00:06:27,049
We don't see why not.

00:06:27,049 --> 00:06:29,518
So you think you can
find other sponsors

00:06:29,518 --> 00:06:30,786
that wanna market to moms?

00:06:30,786 --> 00:06:32,655
It's easy. I mean,
you can imagine,

00:06:32,655 --> 00:06:34,924
it's not that difficult
to find other partners.

00:06:36,859 --> 00:06:39,261
I gotta tell you,
when I hear you saying "easily--

00:06:39,261 --> 00:06:41,364
I can get a sponsor
for $300,000 easily"...
right.

00:06:41,364 --> 00:06:43,432
It really undermines
your credibility with me,

00:06:43,432 --> 00:06:47,770
because if it was that easy,
you'd have multiple sponsors.

00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,438
There's more risk
in doing sponsorship deals...

00:06:49,438 --> 00:06:50,773
yes.
Than selling ticket sales.

00:06:50,773 --> 00:06:52,708
No, you guys--You guys
are missing the point.

00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:55,177
The thing is, we were
doing this before sponsorship,

00:06:55,177 --> 00:06:56,178
and we'll continue doing it
without.
(Kevin) I don't think
I'm missing anything.

00:06:56,178 --> 00:06:58,867
Heather, how many parties can
you throw that sell tickets,

00:06:58,867 --> 00:07:00,134
that allow you
to generate revenue?

00:07:00,134 --> 00:07:02,737
That's how you can control
your own destiny, right?

00:07:02,737 --> 00:07:04,606
Well, since we've been
through that experience,

00:07:04,606 --> 00:07:06,608
and since we worked for three
years without sponsorship...

00:07:06,608 --> 00:07:09,166
When you said you had
a network of moms everywhere

00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:12,302
that you were working with,
that's enormous value.

00:07:12,302 --> 00:07:13,837
When you started to tell me
about all these kids

00:07:13,837 --> 00:07:16,339
you brought into these events
all the time,

00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:18,141
I could see value in that.

00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:20,744
When you started polluting it
with all the other stuff,

00:07:20,744 --> 00:07:22,746
that ruined it.

00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:24,614
I'm out.

00:07:24,614 --> 00:07:26,416
But we've sunk into creative,

00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:27,350
and we've built the brand,
and it's doing great.
But, Heather, Heather,

00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,419
the challenge
that we're having here...

00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:30,287
Yes?
Nobody said
you did a bad job,

00:07:30,287 --> 00:07:32,289
nobody said
you didn't dedicate yourself.

00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:34,958
We just don't understand
what's happening going forward.

00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,627
I'm absolutely lost.
I'm out.

00:07:39,162 --> 00:07:41,298
Honestly, we are
making this up as we go.

00:07:41,298 --> 00:07:43,233
We have created
this brand--
No kidding.

00:07:43,233 --> 00:07:44,434
You are making it up
as you go.

00:07:44,434 --> 00:07:45,902
(laughs)
Think of it this way--

00:07:45,902 --> 00:07:47,304
I'm just a simple investor

00:07:47,304 --> 00:07:48,138
trying to scratch out
a living, okay?

00:07:48,138 --> 00:07:49,873
Right.
He's right when he says
he's simple.

00:07:49,873 --> 00:07:51,141
And I don't understand how

00:07:51,141 --> 00:07:51,942
I could ever
make any money with you.

00:07:51,942 --> 00:07:54,010
I don't understand
what you're doing.

00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,812
I simply wanna go to bed
richer than I woke up.

00:07:55,812 --> 00:07:57,748
That'll never happen
with you guys.

00:07:57,748 --> 00:07:59,750
I am out.

00:08:03,153 --> 00:08:05,489
I like what you're doing.
I like the premise of it.

00:08:05,489 --> 00:08:07,557
Kids being happy and dancing

00:08:07,557 --> 00:08:09,159
at good, healthy,
fun parties is great.

00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:11,495
But I have to say,
I'm concerned

00:08:11,495 --> 00:08:13,296
that the business model
isn't there,

00:08:13,296 --> 00:08:16,299
and I'm--I just don't think
that I would make back

00:08:16,299 --> 00:08:17,501
my money fast enough.

00:08:17,501 --> 00:08:19,436
And for that reason,
I'm out.

00:08:19,436 --> 00:08:22,005
Thank you.

00:08:22,005 --> 00:08:24,007
Look, you--You built something
that nobody else could do.

00:08:24,007 --> 00:08:26,610
You built a business with moms

00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,145
to do shows to attract kids.

00:08:28,145 --> 00:08:31,681
You grew the market,
and you stopped doing that.

00:08:31,681 --> 00:08:33,550
In what way
did we stop doing it, though?

00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,751
Our numbers of attendees
have increased.

00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:38,421
We threw a 5,000-Person party
in central Park last year.
Look, I...

00:08:38,421 --> 00:08:38,955
Andy, I-I gotta tell you,

00:08:38,955 --> 00:08:41,892
I-I'm not buying
into the business plan. I'm out.

00:08:43,894 --> 00:08:45,228
Good luck, guys.
Appreciate it.

00:08:45,228 --> 00:08:46,229
Thank you, though.
Thank you.

00:08:46,229 --> 00:08:47,564
Appreciate it.
(Lori) Good luck.

00:08:47,564 --> 00:08:49,099
Ready, boss?

00:08:53,837 --> 00:08:55,539
It's not
a horrible business.

00:08:55,539 --> 00:08:57,474
You know what, though?
They're not salespeople.

00:08:57,474 --> 00:08:57,808
But they just confused
the whole thing

00:08:57,808 --> 00:09:00,010
by trying to tell us
they had so much going on.

00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,611
What are we talking
about this for?

00:09:01,611 --> 00:09:03,680
What's the point?
(laughs) Yeah. Right. Right.

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,015
It's over. We never
have to listen to that again.

00:09:05,015 --> 00:09:08,018
Heather is a survivor.
I'm a survivor.

00:09:08,018 --> 00:09:10,287
We are excited
to move forward.

00:09:10,287 --> 00:09:12,155
And, you know,
it's a humbling experience.

00:09:12,155 --> 00:09:13,490
Sometimes it feels good

00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:15,358

on the pro rodeo circuit.

00:09:40,884 --> 00:09:44,354
Ten years ago, I got injured
really bad at a rodeo.

00:09:44,354 --> 00:09:45,822
I went to over 15 doctors,

00:09:45,822 --> 00:09:46,957
and they said
I'd never ride again.

00:09:46,957 --> 00:09:50,293
I was so determined to get
my health back and life back,

00:09:50,293 --> 00:09:52,629
I got certified as a trainer
and healed my body.

(Ryan) We're galloping

00:10:01,104 --> 00:10:02,405
I just had this burning desire

Let me show you crazy.
Check this out.

00:11:08,371 --> 00:11:09,806
Yep! That's me.

00:11:09,806 --> 00:11:11,875
I was a rodeo rider
on the pro rodeo circuit.

00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:15,078
I then started having
chronic lower back pain.

00:11:15,078 --> 00:11:17,414
I went to over 15 doctors.

00:11:17,414 --> 00:11:21,284
They said I'd never ride again
or never do anything physical,

00:11:21,284 --> 00:11:23,086
and I'd have to live
with a "bad back."

00:11:23,086 --> 00:11:26,423
I was so determined
to heal my back

00:11:26,423 --> 00:11:27,757
and prove those doctors wrong,

00:11:27,757 --> 00:11:29,759
I went and got certified
as a personal trainer

00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:31,628
to learn about my body.

00:11:31,628 --> 00:11:33,667
And that's when
I developed this system

00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:36,603
that makes any workout
more efficient,

00:11:36,603 --> 00:11:39,339
and it'll maximize
your result.

00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:42,342
So I put it to the test,
and in three months' time,

00:11:42,342 --> 00:11:45,445
I shredded my body
down to 4.3% body fat.

00:11:45,445 --> 00:11:49,115
I healed
chronic lower back pain.

00:11:49,115 --> 00:11:50,316
And then I developed...

00:11:50,316 --> 00:11:53,520
Rodeo abs! Whoo-Hoo!
(laughter)

00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,389
I then returned to rodeo

00:11:56,389 --> 00:12:00,060
to win a national championship
in Dallas, Texas.

00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,329

00:12:11,604 --> 00:12:14,407
Kevin!
(laughter)

00:12:14,407 --> 00:12:18,244
At 52 years old, he started
working out for the first time.

00:12:18,244 --> 00:12:20,046
I taught him my system,

00:12:20,046 --> 00:12:22,115
and in ten months' time,

00:12:22,115 --> 00:12:26,386
this is what he did
with only three workouts a week.

00:12:26,386 --> 00:12:26,920
Look at that.

00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,588
Nice.

00:12:28,588 --> 00:12:30,390
Now here's Shawn

00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:33,727
he used to do 2-hour
extreme gym workouts.

00:12:33,727 --> 00:12:36,129
He then got my system,

00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:38,531
cut his workout time
literally in half,

00:12:38,531 --> 00:12:41,067
and this is what Shawn did.

00:12:41,067 --> 00:12:44,003
(laughter)
Look at that.

00:12:44,003 --> 00:12:45,338
Wow.

00:12:45,338 --> 00:12:48,074
So, sharks,
with your investment today,

00:12:48,074 --> 00:12:52,312
I can get my lose 12 inches
with any 12 workouts

00:12:52,312 --> 00:12:56,916

00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,119

That's what I'm talkin' about!
(laughter)

00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,459
Who's ready
to ride with me?

00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:07,927
You gotta tell us
more about it.

00:13:07,927 --> 00:13:11,131
Yes, absolutely.
Thank you for asking.

00:13:11,131 --> 00:13:13,466
What it is, is it's
a software program

00:13:13,466 --> 00:13:15,468
that I developed.

00:13:15,468 --> 00:13:17,871
You put in
your personal information,

00:13:17,871 --> 00:13:21,941
and this calculates
your heart rate training zone

00:13:21,941 --> 00:13:24,844
where you need to work out
during any workout.

00:13:24,844 --> 00:13:27,313
And you wear
a heart rate monitor watch.

00:13:27,313 --> 00:13:28,982
If your heart rate
gets too high,

00:13:28,982 --> 00:13:31,050
you're gonna use muscles
for energy,

00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,186
and you're gonna be
losing muscle,

00:13:33,186 --> 00:13:35,255
and you'll never,
ever, ever

00:13:35,255 --> 00:13:36,790
tap into your body fat.

00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,125
It's all about
working out efficient.

00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:42,595
So this simple program--
It's a trade secret.

00:13:42,595 --> 00:13:45,665
And this is a dvd
that just educates people,

00:13:45,665 --> 00:13:48,268
teaches them about
the heart rate training.

00:13:48,268 --> 00:13:50,470
Why it's so important,
and what it does to your body.
Ryan...

00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,139
so I work out all the time.

00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:54,541
You need the system.
It's not working.

00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,409
Because if I wasn't
in the gym every day,

00:13:56,409 --> 00:13:58,244
I'd look like Mr. O'Leary.
(laughs)

00:13:58,244 --> 00:13:59,712
But I don't look like you.

00:13:59,712 --> 00:14:01,247
They don't look real.
Yeah.

00:14:01,247 --> 00:14:03,316
I mean, your abs,
I've never seen--
Thank you.

00:14:03,316 --> 00:14:05,318
It's like
the incredible hulk.

00:14:05,318 --> 00:14:05,852
Well, and here's
what's really crazy--

00:14:05,852 --> 00:14:08,454
in March,
I'll be 41 years old.

00:14:08,454 --> 00:14:09,856
I'm literally
in the shape of my life,

00:14:09,856 --> 00:14:13,993
and I've never worked out
so smart and efficient.

00:14:13,993 --> 00:14:14,994
So what do I do?

00:14:14,994 --> 00:14:16,196
It's so simple.

00:14:16,196 --> 00:14:18,131
What you're gonna do,
Robert--

00:14:18,131 --> 00:14:19,666
You're gonna put
this watch on.

00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,935
A heart rate monitor?
Heart rate monitor watch.

00:14:21,935 --> 00:14:27,207
The secret is, is me teaching
you how to use the watch.

00:14:27,207 --> 00:14:27,674
When I buy
my heart rate monitor,

00:14:27,674 --> 00:14:30,510
they tell me I gotta get
my heart rate above 140.

00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:37,250
But it doesn't give you
a precise scientific program

00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,252
that tells you
your exact zones.

00:14:39,252 --> 00:14:41,588
So is it tailored
towards me?

00:14:41,588 --> 00:14:42,722
Yes. It's all about the zone.
(Lori)
if I'm understanding right,

00:14:42,722 --> 00:14:44,457
it's not like
you put in a disc,

00:14:44,457 --> 00:14:45,992
and then you've got
an exercise routine to follow.

00:14:45,992 --> 00:14:47,727
No. This--
This all has to do
with the heart rate

00:14:47,727 --> 00:14:51,931
and whatever
you've figured out?
Absolutely.

00:14:51,931 --> 00:14:54,000
You'll go do
your hour of elliptical,

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,002
and whatever--Whatever workout
that you may do,

00:14:56,002 --> 00:14:59,339
and you're just gonna
stay in your zone.

00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:00,273
(Robert)
Tell me your plan.

00:15:00,273 --> 00:15:03,309
Yes. Step one would be
internet--

00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:06,446
for $9.95,
they could download this.

00:15:06,446 --> 00:15:09,382
They're gonna instantly learn
how the system works.

00:15:09,382 --> 00:15:12,652
Step two that I see--
Get me on tv.

00:15:12,652 --> 00:15:14,120
Get me in front
of the viewer.

00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,389
You're talking
infomercial here.

00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:17,390
Absolutely.
Infomercial...

00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,325
he's the thighmaster cowboy.
Tv sales...

00:15:19,325 --> 00:15:21,394
Yee-Haw!
Yeah, I mean,
you've got the personality.

00:15:21,394 --> 00:15:22,595
Thank you.
It's great.

00:15:22,595 --> 00:15:24,330
But there's one thing you've
gotta be really careful about

00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:27,467
on tv,
and that is false claim.

00:15:28,868 --> 00:15:30,003
It says right there--

00:15:30,003 --> 00:15:32,272
"Lose 12 inches
with any 12 workouts."

00:15:32,272 --> 00:15:34,540
Whether or not
the system works or not

00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,577
is something that really
has to be validated, proven.

00:15:37,577 --> 00:15:39,712
You have to have
an independent lab that shows

00:15:39,712 --> 00:15:43,249
that you really actually lose
weight by doing this system.

00:15:43,249 --> 00:15:43,583
(Kevin) None of this
makes any money.

00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:46,452
I think what cowboy Ryan's
saying is,

00:15:46,452 --> 00:15:49,589
"look, I'm a guy that you put
into an infomercial.

00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:51,658
"I can go crazy
bouncing off the ceiling.

00:15:51,658 --> 00:15:52,592
It's fun to watch."
I agree.

00:15:52,592 --> 00:15:55,194
But what am I selling them
afterwards?

00:15:55,194 --> 00:15:57,130
How do I make money.
Well, cowboy Ryan,
there's the challenge.

00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:00,266
Yes.
That brings up
my next point.

00:16:00,266 --> 00:16:00,934
This is phase one--

00:16:00,934 --> 00:16:03,069
Teach people
the heart-Rate training--

00:16:03,069 --> 00:16:03,603
Work out smart.

00:16:03,603 --> 00:16:07,473
Phase two is my complete
Motivational dvd system.

00:16:07,473 --> 00:16:11,244
And I have a lot more products
that--that I've developed.

00:16:11,244 --> 00:16:14,247
So I patented a machine,
I used it,

00:16:14,247 --> 00:16:16,516
developed my abs,
healed my back.

00:16:16,516 --> 00:16:20,119
I licensed it to a company
earlier this year.

00:16:20,119 --> 00:16:23,389
So are you ready?
Check this out right here.

00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:24,924
And you'll never guess
the name of it.

00:16:24,924 --> 00:16:29,662
Rodeo abs!
Yeah! Right there.

00:16:29,662 --> 00:16:31,264
That's the machine
I developed.

00:16:31,264 --> 00:16:34,334
The reason it is so unique
and so proficient

00:16:34,334 --> 00:16:38,471
is because my patented
rolling wheel technology--

00:16:38,471 --> 00:16:40,673
What this does--
You just sit on it,

00:16:40,673 --> 00:16:42,475
you just put your feet on it,

00:16:42,475 --> 00:16:44,844
and you just pull your feet
up and down just like that.

00:16:44,844 --> 00:16:46,112
What are the handles for?

00:16:46,112 --> 00:16:46,913
Oh, great question.

00:16:46,913 --> 00:16:49,048
Those are the reins for when
you're riding your horse--

00:16:49,048 --> 00:16:50,984
Hyah, hyah. Just kidding.

00:16:50,984 --> 00:16:52,518
(laughter)

00:16:52,518 --> 00:16:53,786
I had ya.

00:16:53,786 --> 00:16:55,588
It's a full-body machine,
'Kay?

00:16:55,588 --> 00:16:59,058
Arm curls, upper back,
lats.

00:16:59,058 --> 00:17:00,460
Everything's different now.

00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,396
Now you're startin' to want
to ride with me, aren't ya?

00:17:03,396 --> 00:17:04,731
Can I sit on it and try it?
Yeah, absolutely.

00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:06,399
I just wanna see.
And by working
your hamstrings,

00:17:06,399 --> 00:17:08,067
you know what
it does, ladies? Watch...

00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:09,202
(Wolf-Whistles)

00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:10,870
(laughs)
(laughs)

00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:14,607
Now if you have tennis shoes on,
you'd pull up and down,

00:17:14,607 --> 00:17:17,310
and you'd also
put pressure downward.

00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,764
Do you feel it, Lori?

00:17:18,764 --> 00:17:20,097
I do feel it.

00:17:20,097 --> 00:17:22,366
I can't believe you waited
so long to show us this.

00:17:22,366 --> 00:17:24,101
Did you make any money
off it?
Uh, yeah.

00:17:24,101 --> 00:17:26,233
Sold in Australia
and Germany.

00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:27,367
Did it sell well?

00:17:27,367 --> 00:17:28,969
It did a little over
a million dollars.

00:17:28,969 --> 00:17:30,571
Whoa.

00:17:30,571 --> 00:17:32,973
You remind me of an artist
that needs a producer.

00:17:32,973 --> 00:17:34,708
That's what I think
the analogy is.

00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:35,909
Hmm.
That's a good analogy.

00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:38,312
You have a tremendous amount
of energy.

00:17:38,312 --> 00:17:41,448
But I don't see
the potential for me

00:17:41,448 --> 00:17:44,184
to give you $120,000
and make it back.

00:17:44,184 --> 00:17:47,387
But somewhere out there
is the right person for you.

00:17:47,387 --> 00:17:50,424
But it's not me.
I'm out.

00:17:50,424 --> 00:17:52,092
Thank you.

00:17:52,092 --> 00:17:54,561
(Robert) Mark?
Ryan, I gotta tell you,

00:17:54,561 --> 00:17:56,096
I'm guessing
you're a great trainer

00:17:56,096 --> 00:17:57,164
because you've got
the personality for it.

00:17:57,164 --> 00:18:00,834
But sometimes,

00:18:00,834 --> 00:18:04,438
when the volume goes up
so high,

00:18:04,438 --> 00:18:07,441
my skepticism meter
goes up so high.

00:18:07,441 --> 00:18:10,310
I can't figure out
what you are.

00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:13,380
And when
I can't figure it out...

00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,717
that's--That's
a huge problem for me.

00:18:16,717 --> 00:18:19,052
I... I'm just not buying it
right now, Ryan.

00:18:19,052 --> 00:18:21,321
I-I'm sure
you made a great rider.

00:18:21,321 --> 00:18:24,091
But on the business
side of things,

00:18:24,091 --> 00:18:25,893
I'm just not there,
so I'm out.

00:18:25,893 --> 00:18:26,493
Thank you.

00:18:26,493 --> 00:18:28,428
I-I can tell you, though,

00:18:28,428 --> 00:18:30,898
this right here--

00:18:30,898 --> 00:18:32,299
This is my blood,
sweat, and tears.

00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:36,970
Hey, Ryan, did we ever explain
the 12 inches in 12 workouts?

00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:37,437
No, sir, I didn't.

00:18:37,437 --> 00:18:39,439
It's--It's all over
your body.

00:18:39,439 --> 00:18:42,976
So I do a measurement
of your neck, shoulders, chest,

00:18:42,976 --> 00:18:44,178
three measurements
on your abs,

00:18:44,178 --> 00:18:46,713
your hips and your legs.
Oh, I see.

00:18:46,713 --> 00:18:48,782
So I'm not losing
12 inches off my waist?

00:18:48,782 --> 00:18:49,583
N--Particularly, no.

00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,785
I've had a lot of clients
that definitely have.

00:18:51,785 --> 00:18:54,254
But in ten years,

00:18:54,254 --> 00:18:55,923
training 10,000 people,

00:18:55,923 --> 00:18:58,025
I've never had one person

00:18:58,025 --> 00:18:59,827
not lose the minimum
of 12 inches.

00:18:59,827 --> 00:19:00,961
In how long a time?

00:19:00,961 --> 00:19:02,362
12 workouts.

00:19:02,362 --> 00:19:03,497
No way.
Yeah.

00:19:03,497 --> 00:19:06,033
No way.
Yeah. Absolutely.

00:19:06,033 --> 00:19:09,036
Ryan, I-I think your energy
is incredibly infectious.

00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:10,504
All right?
Um, I am gonna challenge you

00:19:10,504 --> 00:19:12,306
on the 12 inches in 12 workouts.

00:19:12,306 --> 00:19:14,107
Oh, I'd love it.
I'd love it.

00:19:14,107 --> 00:19:17,644
Maybe you're the next
cowboy Ryan infomercial king.

00:19:17,644 --> 00:19:20,781
I don't know. But the business
you presented today,

00:19:20,781 --> 00:19:22,516
I-I can't get there.

00:19:22,516 --> 00:19:24,318
This right here,
and you're asking--

00:19:24,318 --> 00:19:25,786
No, I-I hear you,

00:19:25,786 --> 00:19:28,255
but, you know, I-I think
you've had a fair shot.

00:19:28,255 --> 00:19:31,024
Sure.

00:19:31,024 --> 00:19:32,559
I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to be out.

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,028
Thank you.

for the job is a cowgirl.

I love that saying, Lori.

00:19:41,101 --> 00:19:43,370
I think potentially,
there's something great here.

00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,706
Are you gonna be
his producer or not?

So...
are you gonna be

00:20:17,905 --> 00:20:19,773
Well, that's the problem.

00:20:19,773 --> 00:20:22,910
I don't know that it would
be right to be your producer,

00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:25,445
because I'm not sure
what we'd be selling people

00:20:25,445 --> 00:20:28,515
would be the right thing.

00:20:28,515 --> 00:20:31,051
And I always wanna give people
a quality product

00:20:31,051 --> 00:20:33,587
that they're not gonna
be disappointed in.
Absolutely.

00:20:33,587 --> 00:20:35,822
And this has got
a lot of claims.
Absolutely.

00:20:35,822 --> 00:20:38,692
So for that reason...
No.

00:20:38,692 --> 00:20:39,826
Hold on. Just wait.

you throw the cowboy,

00:20:43,163 --> 00:20:46,900
all I ask, and every person
that I've ever come across,

00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:51,238
is you just
give me one chance.

00:20:51,238 --> 00:20:55,108
A chance to be able
to change millions of lives.

00:20:55,108 --> 00:20:56,710
I may be a little clouded,

00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:59,846
but I'm gonna have to
just believe in my heart

00:20:59,846 --> 00:21:01,915
and say
there is something here.

00:21:01,915 --> 00:21:06,053
Just give me one chance.

00:21:06,053 --> 00:21:10,557
You'll never forget the time
you invested in the cowboy.

00:21:10,557 --> 00:21:14,494
Well, here's the thing--

00:21:14,494 --> 00:21:18,565
You need to be able to prove
that this really works.

00:21:18,565 --> 00:21:19,766
I'm not going
to invest today.

00:21:19,766 --> 00:21:23,704
What if--what if I give you
more percentage of the company?

00:21:23,704 --> 00:21:25,505
I'm here.
I want to negotiate.

I'm so sorry,

but I just see
too many challenges here.

And for that reason,
I can't be your cowgirl.

00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:40,459
I'm out.

00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:46,226

You're the brand.

I'm gonna believe
in you. Yeah.

We're gonna ride together.

That's what I'm talkin' about!
I-I fell in love
with you, man.

I know you will.

exactly what happened there?

he would bust his butt...

Before "Shark Tank,"

00:23:03,703 --> 00:23:05,639
we had about $75,000
worth of sales.

00:23:05,639 --> 00:23:09,843
Since "Shark Tank,"
we've almost exceeded $350,000.

00:23:09,843 --> 00:23:11,178
Those look great.

00:23:11,178 --> 00:23:13,513
The demand for our pretzels
is crazy.

00:23:13,513 --> 00:23:14,915
I was drowning in orders

00:23:14,915 --> 00:23:16,516
and making all the pretzels
by myself.

00:23:16,516 --> 00:23:19,986
Now I've been able to move
into a professional facility

00:23:19,986 --> 00:23:22,456
and hire a small team.

00:23:22,456 --> 00:23:24,024

I really love working
With Mark Cuban.

Just the painted pretzel.

The painted pretzel is now
sold in landmark theaters,

in the tank.

For my family,
the success after "Shark Tank"

Has meant financial freedom

00:23:38,905 --> 00:23:40,640
We get to spend
more quality time together

We're from

And we're seeking
a $160,000 investment

00:24:19,608 --> 00:24:22,744

00:24:22,744 --> 00:24:24,613
Cellhelmet
is the world's first

00:24:24,613 --> 00:24:26,081
and only
brand of accessories

00:24:26,081 --> 00:24:29,951
to include a safety net
of accidental damage coverage

00:24:29,951 --> 00:24:31,653
for your mobile device.

00:24:31,653 --> 00:24:32,187

with the mobile
protection industry

00:24:34,122 --> 00:24:35,791
is you're forced
into ridiculous accessories

00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:38,393
and ridiculous
monthly insurance premiums.

00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,128
But when your device
does break,

00:24:40,128 --> 00:24:41,863
you're either out of luck

00:24:41,863 --> 00:24:43,799
because your case manufacturer
won't do a thing,

00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,267
or you're pounded
with a hefty deductible.

00:24:45,267 --> 00:24:46,201

00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:53,075
This company goes as far
as telling me

00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:55,210
that this case
can withstand abuse

00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:56,344
from a boat anchor.

Now Let's take a look
at these screen protectors.

00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,720
This company goes as far
as telling me

00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,233
that these are
"Military grade,"

00:25:08,233 --> 00:25:11,102
and that they can withstand
abuse from rotary tools.

00:25:11,102 --> 00:25:11,767
They better be,

00:25:11,767 --> 00:25:13,168
or we just spent 20 bucks
on some plastic film.

00:25:13,168 --> 00:25:16,600

00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:20,066

00:25:20,066 --> 00:25:22,068
Neither device
has survived.

00:25:22,068 --> 00:25:23,537
You're facing
two issues now.

00:25:23,537 --> 00:25:26,339
Number one--Your accessories
manufacturer is gonna say

00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:27,674
you're crap out of luck,

00:25:27,674 --> 00:25:30,744
'cause they could care less
that your device is damaged,

00:25:30,744 --> 00:25:32,879
even though they told you
it probably would survive.

00:25:32,879 --> 00:25:35,348
Number two--
Your insurance deductible

00:25:35,348 --> 00:25:39,052
is gonna cost you
upwards of $200,

00:25:39,052 --> 00:25:40,854
depending on your device
and your provider,

00:25:40,854 --> 00:25:43,190
which doesn't sound fair
to me at all.

00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,925
So now in comparison...
no!

00:25:44,925 --> 00:25:46,860
Let's take a look
at the cellhelmet brand.

00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,663
Are we saying
that our cellhelmet cases

00:25:49,663 --> 00:25:52,866
can withstand all kinds
of crazy abuse?

00:25:52,866 --> 00:25:55,335
Whoa.
Absolutely...

00:25:55,335 --> 00:25:56,336
not.

00:25:56,336 --> 00:25:57,604
(laughter)

00:25:57,604 --> 00:26:01,808
If a cellhelmet case does fail
to protect your device,

00:26:01,808 --> 00:26:04,811
we're gonna repair it
or replace it for 50 bucks.

00:26:04,811 --> 00:26:07,547
Are we magicians?
Not at all.

00:26:07,547 --> 00:26:10,851
We just happen to be
the only company on earth

00:26:10,851 --> 00:26:12,385
who's bundling
our protective accessories

00:26:12,385 --> 00:26:16,122
with a safety net
of accidental damage coverage.

00:26:16,122 --> 00:26:17,991
With our hard work
and the help of the sharks,

00:26:17,991 --> 00:26:19,726

massive niche in this market.

00:26:26,533 --> 00:26:27,400

00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:32,339
So what you're offering here
is--is an insurance policy,

00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:34,074
or a case, or both?

00:26:34,074 --> 00:26:36,676
Basically what you're doing is--
Basically what we're doing

00:26:36,676 --> 00:26:38,812
is pre-Buying your repair

00:26:38,812 --> 00:26:43,016
in the instance that you should
have an accidental damage.

00:26:43,016 --> 00:26:45,652
You buy the case
for $44.99,

00:26:45,652 --> 00:26:49,055
and you register the case
within 30 days of purchasing it.

00:26:49,055 --> 00:26:51,391
At that point, you now have
one year of a safety net.

00:26:51,391 --> 00:26:54,261
If your phone accidentally
breaks inside of our case,

00:26:54,261 --> 00:26:56,930
you're gonna call
our 24/7 hotline,

00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:59,199
and it's gonna be repaired
or replaced

00:26:59,199 --> 00:27:00,534
within three business days.

00:27:00,534 --> 00:27:02,469
So you don't give me
another phone?

00:27:02,469 --> 00:27:04,804
If we are unable
to repair the device,

00:27:04,804 --> 00:27:07,140
we will replace
the device.

00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,742
So walk me through the model--
How long you've been around?

00:27:08,742 --> 00:27:10,477
We've been manufacturing
the cellhelmet case

00:27:10,477 --> 00:27:13,013
for four months now.

00:27:13,013 --> 00:27:13,813
And have you sold any?

00:27:13,813 --> 00:27:16,583
We have sold 1,300 units
directly to the end consumer.

00:27:16,583 --> 00:27:18,118
Oh, my goodness.

00:27:18,118 --> 00:27:19,986
You guys are nothing burgers
in this space.

00:27:19,986 --> 00:27:22,055
The guys who control this

00:27:22,055 --> 00:27:24,791
do hundreds of millions of
dollars in distribution.
They just started
four months ago.

00:27:24,791 --> 00:27:26,927
We've done about
$60,000 in revenue.

00:27:26,927 --> 00:27:28,995
And what's it cost you
to repair?

00:27:28,995 --> 00:27:31,731
Our average repair
for a smartpho--

00:27:31,731 --> 00:27:33,733
Or for any device is $77.

00:27:33,733 --> 00:27:34,401
But you're paying
for all that yourselves?

00:27:34,401 --> 00:27:37,604
Yes. Uh, basically,
the way it works is--

00:27:37,604 --> 00:27:39,272
Oh, I hate
your business model so much.

00:27:39,272 --> 00:27:40,674
I have to punish you.
I just don't know how.

00:27:40,674 --> 00:27:42,467
It's a profitable venture.

00:27:42,467 --> 00:27:44,135
So do you know
what the attrition rate is?

00:27:44,135 --> 00:27:45,803
Do you have any idea yet?

00:27:45,803 --> 00:27:47,272
Yeah. Right now,
over the past four months,

00:27:47,272 --> 00:27:48,273
we're averaging about 3%.

00:27:48,273 --> 00:27:49,407
3% repair rate.

00:27:49,407 --> 00:27:52,177
And the average is--
It costs you $77 a hit?

00:27:52,177 --> 00:27:53,645
So let me
explain something to you--

00:27:53,645 --> 00:27:54,245
That--We have that $45

00:27:54,245 --> 00:27:56,781
when you purchase
that case up front.

00:27:56,781 --> 00:27:58,850
There is a $50 repair fee,

00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:00,652
so we're always
gonna be profitable.

00:28:00,652 --> 00:28:02,587
Compare that to--
Sorry. So I buy the case,

00:28:02,587 --> 00:28:03,188
I pay you $44.

00:28:03,188 --> 00:28:04,789
Yeah.
But then if it breaks,

00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:06,391
I call you up, and you say,
"give me 50 bucks."

00:28:06,391 --> 00:28:08,593
(Lori) Yes.
There's--there's
a $50 handling fee.

00:28:08,593 --> 00:28:09,394
So it's like a deductible?

00:28:09,394 --> 00:28:11,996
That's a good way
of associating it.

00:28:11,996 --> 00:28:13,464
Let me ask you this.

00:28:13,464 --> 00:28:15,800
Let's say you have to
replace the phone.

00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,936
Do you make any money
at that point?

00:28:17,936 --> 00:28:19,604
Now you're out
$200, $300 bucks.

00:28:19,604 --> 00:28:22,974
It's very hard to get
to the point of replacement.

00:28:22,974 --> 00:28:24,576
Uh...

00:28:24,576 --> 00:28:27,045
so if I broke my phone
using someone else's case,

00:28:27,045 --> 00:28:29,981
then I went out and bought
your case for $44.95

00:28:29,981 --> 00:28:33,851
thinking, "aha, I'm gonna pull
a quickie on these guys..."

00:28:33,851 --> 00:28:34,519
there are people out there

00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:36,654
that take advantage
of the system.

00:28:36,654 --> 00:28:38,256
It's gonna happen
for eternity.

00:28:38,256 --> 00:28:41,526
Uh, but basically,
the way our model works,

00:28:41,526 --> 00:28:44,796
our average take is above
our average payout.

00:28:44,796 --> 00:28:46,531
It's very fitting
that you wore those helmets.

00:28:46,531 --> 00:28:49,467
Have you ever heard
of a viking funeral?

00:28:49,467 --> 00:28:51,603
Uh, no, I...
they load up
a boat with wood.

00:28:51,603 --> 00:28:53,605
(laughter)
They put the dead bodies
on the top.

00:28:53,605 --> 00:28:56,407
They set it on fire and they
push it out into the ocean.

00:28:56,407 --> 00:28:57,375
That's you guys.

00:28:57,375 --> 00:28:59,110
This is a horrible idea.

00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:01,579
I'm out
with extreme prejudice.

00:29:01,579 --> 00:29:04,515
I wanna set you on fire
and float you out of the tank.

00:29:04,515 --> 00:29:06,918
(laughter)
We appreciate your time.

00:29:06,918 --> 00:29:10,722
Mike--Look, if you're
in the case business...
yes.

00:29:10,722 --> 00:29:12,056
I'm not a big fan
of the cases.

00:29:12,056 --> 00:29:14,859
Okay.
I think--So I don't think
you're in that business.

00:29:14,859 --> 00:29:16,127
I think you're in

00:29:16,127 --> 00:29:19,464
the "person who's afraid their
phone's gonna break" business.

00:29:19,464 --> 00:29:21,332
So if that's
the business you're in,

00:29:21,332 --> 00:29:24,068
I-I don't see the growth there.

00:29:24,068 --> 00:29:25,203
If my phone breaks,

00:29:25,203 --> 00:29:26,404
I just wanna walk in,
here you go,

00:29:26,404 --> 00:29:28,072
give me a new one.

00:29:28,072 --> 00:29:30,975
Um, I don't buy
into the strategy.

00:29:30,975 --> 00:29:32,777
I'm out.

00:29:32,777 --> 00:29:34,712
Yeah. Thank you
very much for your time.
Okay. Thank you.

00:29:34,712 --> 00:29:36,047
I agree with Robert.

00:29:36,047 --> 00:29:39,717
It's like you're in the, uh,
cell phone hospital business,

00:29:39,717 --> 00:29:41,052
and I think it needs to be

00:29:41,052 --> 00:29:43,521
cell phone emergency room
business,

00:29:43,521 --> 00:29:45,523
which really
wouldn't be fast enough.

00:29:45,523 --> 00:29:47,725
For that reason,
I'm out.

00:29:48,726 --> 00:29:51,062
This, to me,
is really an insurance deal.

00:29:51,062 --> 00:29:53,865
And I'm sorry there's so many
unethical people out there.

00:29:53,865 --> 00:29:55,667
I think they're gonna
take advantage of it.

00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:56,934
I'm out.

00:29:58,736 --> 00:30:00,805
And four sharks are out.

00:30:00,805 --> 00:30:02,407
There's only one left.
We got one left.

00:30:02,407 --> 00:30:04,909
Guys, I get your business.

00:30:04,909 --> 00:30:05,843
Definitely.

00:30:05,843 --> 00:30:07,845
You guys are in
the arbitrage business--

00:30:07,845 --> 00:30:08,846
You're in a business
of collecting money

00:30:08,846 --> 00:30:10,381
and just hoping
to pay out less.

00:30:10,381 --> 00:30:11,382
You're taking advantage

00:30:11,382 --> 00:30:13,451
of the inefficiencies
of a market.

00:30:13,451 --> 00:30:14,786
Yep.
Yes.

00:30:14,786 --> 00:30:15,920
That sounds good,

00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,255
but what happens
in that type of market

00:30:17,255 --> 00:30:20,591
is that other people
with more money

00:30:20,591 --> 00:30:22,927
figure it out very quickly.

00:30:22,927 --> 00:30:25,330
So they'll see what type
of conversions you'll do,

00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:29,267
and they'll say,
"if I only charge $25,

00:30:29,267 --> 00:30:33,805
"and I triple what they're
spending in online marketing,

00:30:33,805 --> 00:30:35,673
I can do the same thing."

00:30:35,673 --> 00:30:38,376
This truly is a scenario
where big money can come in

00:30:38,376 --> 00:30:40,712
and play the financial
aspect of this game,

00:30:40,712 --> 00:30:42,847
because there are
no barriers to entry.

00:30:42,847 --> 00:30:45,049
The number one thing
we do like about that idea

00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:47,051
is when the big company
comes in

00:30:47,051 --> 00:30:48,920
and does what we're doing,

00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,054
that validates
what we're doing.

00:30:50,054 --> 00:30:51,055
Bull crap.

00:30:51,055 --> 00:30:53,191
Are you in or out, mark?

00:30:53,191 --> 00:30:54,859
I'm out.

00:30:54,859 --> 00:30:57,595
Thank you very much.
Sorry, guys.

00:30:57,595 --> 00:31:00,398
Okay, sven and thor...
(laughter)

00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:01,599
It's time for you
to get on the boat.

00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:03,201
And it's with heavy heart

00:31:03,201 --> 00:31:06,137
that I set it afire
and float it out of the tank.

00:31:06,137 --> 00:31:07,405
Thank you, guys.
Appreciate your time.
Thanks, mark.

00:31:07,405 --> 00:31:08,539
Thank you.
Thanks a lot.

00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:09,974
Good luck.
Later.

00:31:13,044 --> 00:31:13,978
I've always
wanted to break stuff.

00:31:15,913 --> 00:31:16,981
Oh. (laughs)

00:31:16,981 --> 00:31:19,117
(laughs)
I've gotta
send it in for repair.

00:31:19,117 --> 00:31:20,585
(laughs)

00:31:20,585 --> 00:31:23,054
I think that putting us
on the boat

00:31:23,054 --> 00:31:24,122
and burning us right away

00:31:24,122 --> 00:31:26,591
didn't really give us
an opportunity

00:31:26,591 --> 00:31:28,259
to get everything out
that we needed to.

Next up is Byron Young,
who believes he's sitting

00:31:43,741 --> 00:31:46,811
on a great opportunity
for the sharks.

00:31:51,949 --> 00:31:53,751
Hi, sharks.
My name is Byron Young.

00:31:53,751 --> 00:31:55,486
My company is cordaroys.

00:31:55,486 --> 00:31:57,889
I'm here seeking
a $200,000 investment

00:31:57,889 --> 00:32:00,291
for 20% of my company.

00:32:00,291 --> 00:32:03,294
Sharks, I'm here today to
show you the cordaroys beanbag

00:32:03,294 --> 00:32:04,762
and demonstrate why
it is the most comfortable

00:32:04,762 --> 00:32:07,632
and versatile chair
in the world.

00:32:07,632 --> 00:32:09,367
Now first of all,
it's like sitting on a cloud.

00:32:09,367 --> 00:32:12,303
There are absolutely
no pressure points,

00:32:12,303 --> 00:32:14,839
'cause it cradles you
with super-soft foam

00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:16,641
that's guaranteed
to never go flat.

00:32:16,641 --> 00:32:18,676
But that's
just the beginning.

00:32:18,676 --> 00:32:21,012
Check this out.

00:32:21,012 --> 00:32:23,481
(unzips)

00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:28,619
With cordaroys...

00:32:28,619 --> 00:32:30,488
there's a bed inside.

00:32:30,488 --> 00:32:31,823
(Lori) Ah.
Cool.

00:32:31,823 --> 00:32:33,424
Sharks, I need your help
getting this amazing product

00:32:33,424 --> 00:32:36,294
into every household,
apartment, and dorm...
(laughs)

00:32:36,294 --> 00:32:38,162
in the U.S. and beyond.

00:32:38,162 --> 00:32:40,298
My product is ready,
my company's ready,

00:32:40,298 --> 00:32:42,633
and I'm ready.
Let's do this.

00:32:42,633 --> 00:32:44,435
Can we feel it?
Absolutely.

00:32:44,435 --> 00:32:47,104
I'm afraid if we sit in it,
we won't come out.

00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:49,307
That's what everybody says.

00:32:49,307 --> 00:32:50,341
You won't wanna get out,
but I'll get you out.

00:32:50,341 --> 00:32:52,009
Just fall back
like you wanna make a dent.

00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:53,611
What do you think?
It's nice.

00:32:53,611 --> 00:32:54,946
Nice, huh?
Yeah.

00:32:54,946 --> 00:32:57,215
Hop in the bed, Lori.
It's really... (laughs)

00:32:57,215 --> 00:32:58,683
This one converts
to a king-size bed.

00:32:58,683 --> 00:33:01,486
This is a full-size.
What's inside? Polyfill?

00:33:01,486 --> 00:33:02,753
It's the same thing
that's in a sofa cushion,

00:33:02,753 --> 00:33:04,088
except for it's shredded.

00:33:04,088 --> 00:33:05,289
So it'll never go flat.

00:33:05,289 --> 00:33:08,893
All the parts are replaceable.
The covers are washable.

00:33:08,893 --> 00:33:10,495
Was it comfortable, Lori?
It--It's really
comfortable. It is.

00:33:10,495 --> 00:33:13,631
So you're saying for $200,000,
I get 20% of your business.

00:33:13,631 --> 00:33:15,633
Absolutely.

00:33:15,633 --> 00:33:17,435
That means you're telling me
it's worth a million dollars.

00:33:17,435 --> 00:33:19,303
Absolutely.
You know?
Or sales are so lucrative

00:33:19,303 --> 00:33:23,574
that you're making at least
$200,000 of profit This year.

00:33:23,574 --> 00:33:25,209
Both.
Oh.

00:33:25,209 --> 00:33:28,346
Oh.
We have a utility patent
on the idea.

00:33:28,346 --> 00:33:29,680
The concept of the bed
coming out of the chair

00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,282
is a utility patent.
Granted?

00:33:31,282 --> 00:33:33,885
Not just a patent,
but we've enforced it twice

00:33:33,885 --> 00:33:36,621
against companies much larger
than us, successfully.

00:33:36,621 --> 00:33:38,289
Really?
Absolutely.

00:33:38,289 --> 00:33:39,824
Good for you.
I like that story.
Absolutely.

00:33:39,824 --> 00:33:41,893
Now let's talk
about the cash.

00:33:41,893 --> 00:33:43,427
The cash.
Um, well, last year,

00:33:43,427 --> 00:33:45,429
we only did $1.4 million
in sales.

00:33:45,429 --> 00:33:46,497
Not bad.
(Robert) Wow.

00:33:46,497 --> 00:33:47,899
And I say
"only $1.4 million"

00:33:47,899 --> 00:33:50,368
Because my business
is designed

00:33:50,368 --> 00:33:51,235
to be
a $5 million business.

00:33:51,235 --> 00:33:52,703
I've got everything in place

00:33:52,703 --> 00:33:55,640
from manufacturing,
products, personnel.

00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,142
Um, we have a-a store
at the mall of America,

00:33:58,142 --> 00:34:00,611
which has been in business
for almost eight years.

00:34:00,611 --> 00:34:02,213
A store--Meaning
your retail store?

00:34:02,213 --> 00:34:05,082
Our retail store,
selling only our products.
Okay.

00:34:05,082 --> 00:34:07,018
All right. What was your net
from last year?

00:34:07,018 --> 00:34:08,286
What was the profit?
The net was the problem,

00:34:08,286 --> 00:34:10,154
because we're at
our critical mass.

00:34:10,154 --> 00:34:12,623
And when I say
we did $1.4 million,

00:34:12,623 --> 00:34:14,559
we only netted about
$100,000 last year.

00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:15,760
That's fine. But have you sold
to any retailers?

00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,828
We're in mostly
privately owned places now.

00:34:17,828 --> 00:34:19,964
We have done qvc.
How did it do?

00:34:19,964 --> 00:34:21,232
We did about $2,400
a minute,

00:34:21,232 --> 00:34:24,769
and that was five days
prior to Christmas.

00:34:24,769 --> 00:34:26,437
Is that good, Lori?
No.

00:34:26,437 --> 00:34:29,907
It's not--I don't think
it is very good.

00:34:29,907 --> 00:34:30,608
But you were five days
prior to Christmas,

00:34:30,608 --> 00:34:33,878
which is a very hard time.
What year was that?

00:34:33,878 --> 00:34:35,346
That's been
about ten years ago,

00:34:35,346 --> 00:34:37,281
or eight years ago.
Oh.

00:34:37,281 --> 00:34:39,550
So you've been
doing this forever.
(Lori) So that's, like,
a whole nother story.

00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,018
I've been doing it
for a while.
How long you been doing it?

00:34:41,018 --> 00:34:42,753
Uh, seriously
since about 2001.

00:34:42,753 --> 00:34:45,222
You've been doing this now
for 11 years?
Yes.

00:34:45,222 --> 00:34:48,893
(Kevin) seriously.
And you've done
about $1.4 million in sales.

00:34:48,893 --> 00:34:50,027
Yes.
In--in the last year.

00:34:50,027 --> 00:34:52,496
We've done up to--
Almost $3 million.

00:34:52,496 --> 00:34:53,698
A year?
Yes.

00:34:53,698 --> 00:34:55,099
And what is your cost
on that?

00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:56,901
Uh, the--the queen,
for instance,

00:34:56,901 --> 00:34:58,569
is sort of
our medium size.

00:34:58,569 --> 00:35:00,104
We make it
for about 70 bucks,

00:35:00,104 --> 00:35:02,506
and it sells for $259.
Yeah. Got it.

00:35:02,506 --> 00:35:04,942
And we get--We have
40% margins on wholesale...

00:35:04,942 --> 00:35:06,744
Yeah?
And 80% on retail.

00:35:06,744 --> 00:35:08,212
Furniture in this country

00:35:08,212 --> 00:35:11,482
is sold in some
pretty big furniture outlets.

00:35:11,482 --> 00:35:13,818
And why aren't they
carrying them?

00:35:13,818 --> 00:35:16,554
Because it takes a salesperson
to sell the product.

00:35:16,554 --> 00:35:18,289
Oh, come on.
It's a beanbag.

00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:20,891
I know, but you do need
to do the demonstration.

00:35:20,891 --> 00:35:23,828
How much investment
have you made into it?

00:35:23,828 --> 00:35:26,030
Well, I've got, uh,
$300,000 in inventory

00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:28,299
right now
that's paid for in full.

00:35:28,299 --> 00:35:30,768
I've got a $100,000
piece of machinery

00:35:30,768 --> 00:35:33,838
that's specially designed by us
to manufacture this product--

00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:35,306
Which, by the way,
is a very key part of this,

00:35:35,306 --> 00:35:38,476
because we can manufacture
these very quickly.

00:35:38,476 --> 00:35:40,478
Tell me what you did
in your web sales

00:35:40,478 --> 00:35:42,146
in just the last year.
A little over
$700,000 last year.

00:35:42,146 --> 00:35:44,682
Our customer is not technically
a beanbag customer.

00:35:44,682 --> 00:35:46,817
You know, for instance,
our mall of America location,

00:35:46,817 --> 00:35:48,686
they're all impulse buys.

00:35:48,686 --> 00:35:50,755
Those people did not come
to the mall to buy a beanbag.

00:35:50,755 --> 00:35:52,356
So what will you use
the money for?

00:35:52,356 --> 00:35:54,892
I will use the money
mainly for marketing.

00:35:54,892 --> 00:35:56,961
And frankly, I'm here
to find a strategic partner

00:35:56,961 --> 00:35:59,030
who has already
done this with a product.

00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,297
That becomes
a challenge for me,

00:36:00,297 --> 00:36:01,632
because I just don't know

00:36:01,632 --> 00:36:04,835
if I-I can give you
assistance in that area.

00:36:04,835 --> 00:36:06,103
Mm-hmm.
If it was manufacturing
and production,

00:36:06,103 --> 00:36:07,638
that'd be a different case,

00:36:07,638 --> 00:36:08,239
but I think
you have that buttoned up.
Right.

00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:10,074
Uh, so, I'm out.

00:36:10,074 --> 00:36:12,543
Okay. All good.

00:36:12,543 --> 00:36:14,812
I like what you're doing.
I think it's interesting.

00:36:14,812 --> 00:36:16,347
But there's two issues--

00:36:16,347 --> 00:36:19,350
One, it's very dependent
on you to go sell...

00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,017
Mm-hmm.
Right?
And the other part is,

00:36:20,017 --> 00:36:22,887
it's--It's geared
towards impulse buys.

00:36:22,887 --> 00:36:24,288
Okay.
And neither one of those

00:36:24,288 --> 00:36:26,424
really benefits
from more spending.

00:36:26,424 --> 00:36:29,427
And you wanna spend
the money on marketing.

00:36:29,427 --> 00:36:33,297
And so I don't see that
necessarily as--As a great fit.

00:36:33,297 --> 00:36:36,701
So for that reason,
I'm out.

00:36:36,701 --> 00:36:38,703
Hate to see it, Mark.
Hate to see it.

00:36:38,703 --> 00:36:40,171
For $200,000 I get 20%?

00:36:40,171 --> 00:36:42,373
You're telling me
it's a million dollars.

00:36:42,373 --> 00:36:44,041
I don't think so.

00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:46,343
I think your company's
worth about four or five times

00:36:46,343 --> 00:36:49,480
what you made This year,
which is about 500 grand.

00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,148
You're not worth
a million bucks.

00:36:51,148 --> 00:36:54,351
Yes, I am. The company's worth
more than a million dollars.

00:36:54,351 --> 00:36:56,220
Well, we can disagree...
well...

00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,822
but it's my money.

00:36:57,822 --> 00:36:59,890
So I think you came in
With too high a price.

00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:01,826
I could adjust it
and go for 50%,

00:37:01,826 --> 00:37:04,628
but I don't think
I'm gonna do it.

00:37:04,628 --> 00:37:07,832
I'm out.
Okay.

00:37:07,832 --> 00:37:10,768
So how many we have left?
Just two?

00:37:10,768 --> 00:37:12,636
Come on. This is
a great deal here.

00:37:12,636 --> 00:37:14,972
Somebody better
jump on it. Come on.

00:37:14,972 --> 00:37:17,374
All right. Let me tell you
where--where I'm at.

00:37:17,374 --> 00:37:18,209
I-I mean I think it's obvious

00:37:18,209 --> 00:37:21,812
you--You--You need somebody
like a Lori for this thing.

00:37:21,812 --> 00:37:26,350
Um, but I wanna be involved.

00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:31,155
I'll give you $200,000 for 40%.

00:37:31,155 --> 00:37:35,359
But I'll put up the $100,000

00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,695
if you can convince Lori to
come in for the other $100,000.

00:37:38,829 --> 00:37:40,498
What do you think, Lori?
Talk to me.

00:37:40,498 --> 00:37:42,967
(laughs)
(laughs)

00:37:42,967 --> 00:37:45,569
Come on.
Women love this product.

00:37:45,569 --> 00:37:47,104
I don't want a partner
on this.

00:37:50,107 --> 00:37:53,611
You know, aero beds are
a multi-billion-dollar business.

00:37:53,611 --> 00:37:55,813
Mm-hmm. Right.
And they don't have a chair.

00:37:55,813 --> 00:37:57,545
So there's a need.

00:37:57,545 --> 00:37:59,734
It might do good on qvc.
Mm-hmm.

00:37:59,734 --> 00:38:00,801
I'm not sure
about the price point.

00:38:00,801 --> 00:38:02,069
So I'm gonna give you
a tough offer.

00:38:02,069 --> 00:38:03,070
Okay.

00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,605
But I'm gonna say first

00:38:04,605 --> 00:38:08,943
that an opportunity like
what I'm going to give you

00:38:08,943 --> 00:38:10,278
is going to come
once in a lifetime...

00:38:10,278 --> 00:38:12,346
Mm-hmm.
And it's going to come fast.

00:38:12,346 --> 00:38:14,148
Okay.
And if you blink,

00:38:14,148 --> 00:38:17,233
it may go away.
Fast like a train
right over your head.

00:38:17,233 --> 00:38:19,433
Ooh! Let's hear
your bloodsucking offer.

00:38:19,433 --> 00:38:22,436
You know
this isn't gonna be good.
So...

00:38:22,436 --> 00:38:23,971
I will give you
the $200,000...

00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:26,473
Okay.
But I want 60%
of the company.

00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:27,408
Wow!

00:38:27,408 --> 00:38:29,677
Whoa.
Ooh.

00:38:29,677 --> 00:38:32,346
♪♪

00:38:35,916 --> 00:38:37,718
♪♪

00:38:38,919 --> 00:38:39,920
Three sharks are out,

00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,990
and Robert's made an offer
to go in with Lori...

00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,658
but she's made an offer
of her own.

00:38:44,658 --> 00:38:46,860
I will give you
the $200,000...
okay.

00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:49,263
But I want 60%
of the company.
Wow!

00:38:49,263 --> 00:38:51,332
Whoa.
Ooh.

00:38:51,332 --> 00:38:53,000
60%?

00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,935
Because you're tired,
you don't wanna do--

00:38:54,935 --> 00:38:57,604
You can't run around
and do all the work. I can.

00:38:57,604 --> 00:38:59,367
She's trying to grab you
by the beanbags on that one.

00:38:59,367 --> 00:39:00,667
And I can get it out there
fast and furious.

00:39:00,667 --> 00:39:03,667
She's obviously
a very, very greedy shark.

00:39:03,667 --> 00:39:06,937
She hasn't eaten today.
She smells blood in the water.

00:39:06,937 --> 00:39:07,938
(laughs)

00:39:07,938 --> 00:39:08,939
Um...

00:39:08,939 --> 00:39:09,873
I'm out.

00:39:09,873 --> 00:39:11,734
Oh, really? Okay.
So--So this is it.

00:39:11,734 --> 00:39:13,336
Well, 'cause you couldn't
talk her into my deal.

00:39:13,336 --> 00:39:14,337
I made my own deal.

00:39:14,337 --> 00:39:15,738
Just so--To be clear here,

00:39:15,738 --> 00:39:17,540
you realize that
she's put a value on you

00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:20,276
that's less than half
of what you asked for?
I know.

00:39:20,276 --> 00:39:22,411
I know. So you wanna
control the company?

00:39:22,411 --> 00:39:24,013
I do.
Could you at least
tell me what the plan is?

00:39:24,013 --> 00:39:27,550
The plan would be
to do our best

00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,551
to blitz it everywhere.

00:39:28,551 --> 00:39:29,752
To get it out,
get it on qvc,

00:39:29,752 --> 00:39:32,321
get it into retail stores.
Possibly an infomercial.

00:39:32,321 --> 00:39:35,258
Try to get it to be seen
fast and furious.

00:39:35,258 --> 00:39:36,900
I mean, that's what I do.

00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,701
I don't think I can
go this long with the company

00:39:38,701 --> 00:39:39,969
and give you control.

00:39:39,969 --> 00:39:41,237
I really wanna work with you.
I really do.

00:39:41,237 --> 00:39:42,839
Counter.
I think it would be great.

00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:44,240
But I think we've got a--

00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,376
I-I have to maintain
control of the company.

00:39:46,376 --> 00:39:47,377
(Mark) put a--
put a contingency on her.

00:39:47,377 --> 00:39:49,712
If she gets sales
to $20 million,

00:39:49,712 --> 00:39:52,715
you'll give her
the next 30%.

00:39:52,715 --> 00:39:55,118
(laughs)
And if you do that,
I'm out.

00:39:55,118 --> 00:39:57,987
So I can't give you control
of the company, obviously.

00:39:57,987 --> 00:39:59,656
I just can't do that.

00:39:59,656 --> 00:40:04,527
So my counter would be
$200,000 for...

00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:05,528
40%.

00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:08,164
Exactly what
my offer was originally.

00:40:08,164 --> 00:40:09,832
But I think that she's
the right person for the deal.

00:40:09,832 --> 00:40:12,502
I really do. I also would
prefer to only have one partner.

00:40:12,502 --> 00:40:14,304
Come on, Lori.

00:40:14,304 --> 00:40:15,772
It's gonna be
too much work for me.

00:40:15,772 --> 00:40:17,840
How do you figure?
That's the problem.

00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,910
Because I know that I'll have to
do all the sales for it.

00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,979
Hmm.
I just know, you know?

00:40:22,979 --> 00:40:25,515
16 years of experience,
400 products later.

00:40:25,515 --> 00:40:27,116
Give me a counter
to your first offer.

00:40:27,116 --> 00:40:28,718
Cer--Certainly
you can do better than that.

00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:30,320
Better than 60%?
Come on.

00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,788
Better than 60.
Come on.

00:40:31,788 --> 00:40:34,190
Certainly you can
do better than 60.

00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:36,259
58.
Ha!

00:40:36,259 --> 00:40:37,794
(laughs)
(laughs)

00:40:37,794 --> 00:40:38,761
(Robert) Like, really?

00:40:38,761 --> 00:40:40,229
I--like, really.

00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,898
I mean, this--This is what
I think it'll take.

00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:44,367
I think I can
make you millions.

00:40:44,367 --> 00:40:46,102
Mm-hmm.
I like you. I would like
working with you.

00:40:46,102 --> 00:40:50,106
But I think it's going to take
an enormous amount of my time,

00:40:50,106 --> 00:40:51,774
my connections, my energy

00:40:51,774 --> 00:40:53,242
to get this
out there everywhere.

00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,178
So are you saying
that if you do have control,

00:40:55,178 --> 00:40:57,981
I have to work less?
Whoa!

00:40:57,981 --> 00:40:59,248
Well...
Good--Good point.

00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,317
Technically, you would
have to work less.

00:41:01,317 --> 00:41:02,452
But you're gonna be
a partner,

00:41:02,452 --> 00:41:03,519
'cause I don't go
into anything

00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:04,854
without somebody
being a partner.

00:41:04,854 --> 00:41:07,590
So at that point,
I've got your full staff,

00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,726
and we've got all
the connections we need, and...

00:41:09,726 --> 00:41:12,061
Yes.
Hmm.

00:41:12,061 --> 00:41:14,564
Gotcha.
Can I trust you?

00:41:14,564 --> 00:41:17,500
I have a reputation
for being extremely trustworthy,

00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:21,104
honest, and ethical. So...
Okay.

00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:21,771
51%?

00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:24,107
(laughter)

00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:24,907
No.
Who gets the 51?

00:41:24,907 --> 00:41:28,778
It's... it's 58%,
$200,000.

00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:30,513
Take it or leave it.

00:41:35,184 --> 00:41:37,453
I came here to make a deal.

00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:39,389
(claps hands) Let's do it.
Okay.

00:41:39,389 --> 00:41:42,392
(Kevin) Wow.
Wow.

00:41:42,392 --> 00:41:44,827
Oh.
Mnh.

00:41:44,827 --> 00:41:46,963
Byron, what happened there?

00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:48,965
I believe that
when the product sells

00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:51,968
as many as we're gonna sell,
it's all gonna be worth it.

00:41:51,968 --> 00:41:52,702
He believes in me.

00:41:52,702 --> 00:41:54,370
I want the product
to succeed

00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:57,040
and become a household name.
That's my goal.

00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,574
If that happens,
everything else will work out.

00:41:58,574 --> 00:42:00,043
Well, hopefully, your new boss
will help you do that.

00:42:00,043 --> 00:42:01,244
(laughs)
(Mark) That's right.

00:42:01,244 --> 00:42:03,579
Promise me?
Yes.

00:42:03,579 --> 00:42:05,314
(Daymond) Yep. Congratulations.
I promise you
I will do my very best.

00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:07,050
All right.
Thank you very much.
Congratulations, Byron.

00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:08,384
Thanks.

00:42:08,384 --> 00:42:09,719
Wow.

00:42:09,719 --> 00:42:11,454
This man went through this
11 years,

00:42:11,454 --> 00:42:12,989
and he gave it up
that easy.

00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:14,791
It's fabulous.
This is a winner.

00:42:14,791 --> 00:42:16,192
He's gonna be like,
"Lori, it's your company.

00:42:16,192 --> 00:42:17,260
I quit. Send me my check."
You guys wanna come up
with an excuse

00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,361
for why he did that.

00:42:18,361 --> 00:42:19,962
I just wanted
to sit in a beanbag

00:42:19,962 --> 00:42:23,833
that was once worth a million
and is now worth $400,000.
(Lori chuckles)

00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:24,701
I really came here
to get a deal.

00:42:24,701 --> 00:42:26,903
I was not leaving without a deal
if at all possible.

00:42:26,903 --> 00:42:29,706
I would rather make, uh,
a little less money

00:42:29,706 --> 00:42:31,974
and have--Work with
someone like Lori

00:42:31,974 --> 00:42:34,310
than to not get the deal.
