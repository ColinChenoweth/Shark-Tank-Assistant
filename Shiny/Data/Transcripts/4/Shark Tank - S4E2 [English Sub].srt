00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:02,850
(Man) The sharks are back

00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,900
in an all-new season
of "Shark Tank,"

00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,700
where hopeful entrepreneurs
from across the country

00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,570
dream of a chance to secure
an investment

00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,500
and gain powerful partners

00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,770
to start, grow, or save
their businesses.

00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,800
First there's the innovators,
then there's the imitators,

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,950
then there's the idiots.

00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,700
If the sharks hear
a great idea,

00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,950
they're ready to invest
using their own money,

00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,580
and they'll fight each other
for a piece of the action.

00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,830
Nobody builds a more well-run
sales network than I do.

00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,780
Oh, that is absolute crap.
Mike. Mike.

00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,620
No, that is so True.
Mike. Oh, come on.

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,920
You've got a great plan.
You gotta execute.

00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,650
But first the entrepreneurs
must convince a shark

00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,680
to invest the full amount
they're asking for,

00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,500
or they'll walk away
with nothing.

00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,750
All we want to know is,
hey, will chicks dig it?

00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:48,750
It's sink...

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,920
This is not morality tank.

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,950
Or swim.

00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,820
We've sold $2 million.

00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,500
Wow!
Whoa!

00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,500
Who are the sharks?

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,870
They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors

00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,500
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,530
Kevin O'Leary is
a venture capitalist

00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,900
who turned a $10,000 loan

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,880
into a software business
worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,870
Barbara Corcoran
went from working

00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,870
as a waitress in manhattan

00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:23,480
to building the city's
preeminent real estate empire.

00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,720
Daymond John is
a fashion and branding expert

00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,950
Who grew
his homegrown clothing line

00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:32,550
into the globally recognized
fashion brand Fubu.

00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,820
Robert Herjavec,

00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,650
the son of
an immigrant factory worker,

00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:36,830
is now a technology mogul

00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,920
who sold his first
internet companies

00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,780
for over $350 million.

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,770
And Mark Cuban, notorious
billionaire entrepreneur

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,680
and the outspoken owner

00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,480
of the Dallas Mavericks.

00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,480
♪♪♪

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,620
First into the shark tank are
Sarah Ponn and Mike Hartwick,

00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:06,620
who believe they're on the cusp
of the next big fitness craze.

00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,850
Hi, sharks.
I'm Mike Hartwick...

00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,530
and I'm Sarah Ponn...

00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,820
and we're here to present
our company surfset fitness.

00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,750
We are seeking $150,000
for 10% equity in our company.

00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,580
Surfset fitness is surf-inspired
exercise equipment

00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,820
and group fitness classes.

00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,550
This is the ripsurferx.

00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,780
It's the world's
first total body surf trainer.

00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,880
We've designed it to mimic

00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,900
the instability
of a surfboard on water.

00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,670
And we have here with us
Lakey Peterson.

00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,700
She's one of the top ten
female surfers in the world

00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,880
and she's here to show you
a few of her moves.

00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,630
So Lakey's gonna walk through
the pop-up.

00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,700
This is one of our moves
in surfset.

00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,600
It's extremely challenging.
It's an athletic move.

00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,750
She's gonna use her arms,

00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,720
her core,
balance, stability.

00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,870
You can see she's rocking
side to side...

00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,950
cool.
All about the imbalance.

00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,900
Now she's gonna show you
how a surfer

00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,930
would dive under a wave.
This is called a duck dive.

00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,770
You can see she's engaging
her triceps, her chest,

00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,830
really working the arms,
the core.

00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,550
And we're gonna finish with
what we call a water Walker.

00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,480
So it's similar
to a one-Legged squat.

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,900
You can see that she's trembling
a little bit.

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,900
She's engaging every muscle
in her core, her legs.

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,750
So we're here today, sharks,
because we have

00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,800
more interest and orders
than we can handle

00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,580
and we need your help.

00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,530
That looks like it's very hard

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,630
for the average person to do
any of those exercises.

00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,900
That's quite complex. It's very
difficult to stay stabilized.

00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,830
Let's take an average bozo
like Robert.

00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,500
Absolutely.
Absolutely. Come on up.

00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,580
The only thing I ask is
your shoes off.

00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,620
Get the full experience,
if you can.

00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,750
She made it look pretty easy.

00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,730
It didn't look that hard,
I gotta be honest.

00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:37,770
So she's had some experience.
So we get up one foot at a time.

00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:38,830
All right, I'll step on.

00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:39,870
There you go.

00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,530
And then bend the knees.

00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,580
Get into your carve and your
surfing motion. Look at him.

00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:45,780
Whoa! Nicely done!

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,800
(Mark) Easy, rob.

00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,950
Whoo!

00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,750
What was the really hard move?

00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,600
Was--was the one foot?
The one foot.

00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,820
(Mark) The one leg.
(Daymond) Single foot.

00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,580
You go one leg
and then you just go like that,

00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,550
as if you're, like, stroking
through the water with your...

00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,820
ooh. That's a little Harder.
Whoa.
(Sarah) like skateboarding,
kind of.

00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,620
(Mike) So, yeah, you gotta find
that middle.

00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,580
(Lakey) It's a little, uh,
it's a little shaky on that one.

00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,580
(Mark) Good night, Robert.

00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,650
(Robert) That was good. Thanks.

00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,600
How do you change
the--the levels?

00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,520
You can change it
really quickly.
Change it on the fly. So...

00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,930
So you want to make this hard?
Snap these off.

00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,730
And it goes just like that.
That makes it harder.

00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,530
You can take all three off.

00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,670
And are those on both sides?

00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,850
Yes.
What happens if you weigh
300 pounds?

00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:19,950
Can you still use it?

00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,700
450.
The board's weight-tested.

00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,880
Boy, I gotta tell you
I'm a little tired.

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,920
See? Yeah.

00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,500
How'd you come up
with the idea?

00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,880
This guy will tell you.

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,480
So I was, uh, I was
a professional hockey player,

00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,700
and I've been
a lifelong surfer.

00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,900
As I was getting towards
the end of my career,

00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,820
I decided, you know, I want
to surf a little bit more,

00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,680
and every time that I spent
more time in the ocean,

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,470
I was--I felt better
on my skates,

00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,550
I-I performed better,
I had better seasons.

00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,780
I really found right then
that there is a tie

00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,700
between fitness and surfing.

00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,680
We made $150,000 in 4 months
running classes.

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,680
So we took it to new York,
our 11 machines.

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,530
We set up in a--
a very large gym there.

00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,800
Believe it or not, it just--
Media windfall.

00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,680
"Good morning America."
We had celebrities on the board,
"Good morning America."

00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,870
"Access Hollywood."

00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,950
We had people paying
$35 a class.

00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,650
We sold out classes
for the entire four months.

00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,470
I'm getting more interested.

00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,880
How much is this unit
retailing for?

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,520
$400.

00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,500
And your cost?
$150.

00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,750
You're gonna have to get this
down to $100

00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,920
for it to retail at $400.

00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,600
Uh, it's not a problem.

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,950
Who's running the show here
on the business side?

00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,570
That's a good question.

00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,620
(chuckles) So, um,

00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,650
when I went to europe,
I got my M.B.A.

00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:25,900
I tried it in finance
for a little bit.

00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,520
You tried finance, you said?

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,630
Yeah. Was in finance.

00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,670
So do you think that
there's anything odd about

00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:33,780
valuing this company
at $1.5 million?

00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,580
Um, no.

00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,680
We've also had 200 inquiries
for franchising,

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,530
to open private studios.

00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,720
So you're coming here
for not only our money

00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,500
but our strategic assistance,

00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,500
but you're only offering us 10%.

00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,900
Why would you offer us
so little?

00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,680
It might be a little
right now,

00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,720
but that 10%
of a large company is--

00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,730
But a company
that we have to work for.

00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,830
We don't want you guys
to work for us.

00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,600
We want to work for--for you.

00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,620
In a sense, we want you to be
able to make a phone call

00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,870
and we want to show up
and do what we do.

00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,900
How much do you think
those phone calls cost?

00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,880
A lot, but we don't want--
It took me 20 years

00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,900
of kissing a lot of butt
to get some of those people...
right. Exactly.

00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,680
On my rolodex.
That's why we value it
so highly.

00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:17,500
I'm gonna make you an offer.
Because I think that

00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,730
it's a great idea,. you could
actually go out there

00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:23,650
and hire professional surfers to
be your certifiers and trainers,

00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,730
which would give you
a lot of authentication.

00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,530
Because of that,
I think you're gonna need more

00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:30,480
than $150,000 in cash
to do it right.

00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,750
And in order to make
an investment in this,

00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,480
I have to have enough skin
in the game.

00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,600
So what I'm gonna do is
offer you $300,000

00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,930
for 33%.

00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,630
So listen,
what just happened there

00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,770
is he knocked the value down
from a million and a half

00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:45,830
to $900,000.

00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,650
But I put you in position
to get out there

00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,650
and not have to stress about how
much cash you have for inventory

00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,780
and to not stress about hearing
these guys nickel-and-dime you.

00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,820
You got nickeled-and-dimed
for 33% just now.

00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,720
(Robert) It's
an interesting offer, Mike.

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,570
I see the business
a little bit differently.

00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,880
I think you don't need
the professional surfer guys.

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,550
I think they're great,

00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,930
but I think that can be
intimidating to a lot of people.

00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,770
The trainers need to be bubbly,
energetic.

00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,680
I'll give you the $150,000--

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,630
'cause I don't think you should
give up that much equity.

00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:18,620
It's gonna go big--for 20%.

00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,920
So a lower valuation is
basically what you're saying.

00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,630
I'm saying keep more equity.

00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,770
Nobody starts a company
out of their basement

00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,600
and works their butt off
to give up one-Third of it

00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,930
at this stage.

00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,800
Don't gamble your future
until you know what you have.

00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,930
A lower valuation
for less money.
Funny. Every time

00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,720
I say something,
I hear somebody else talking.

00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,750
That always happens to you,
Robert.
It's like a shadow.

00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,770
That always happens to you,
Robert.
It's like a mini-me.

00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,770
I have a--an offer as well.

00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,850
And I own many, uh,

00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:51,780
crossfit gyms, so I understand
the lifestyle and the culture.

00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,920
I'm willing to give $150,000,

00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,550
but unlimited manufacturing
of the boards.

00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,780
25%.

00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,580
For free? You're giving
the boards for free?

00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,720
(Robert laughs)

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,820
And I just give you
the cash, right?

00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,550
So you--You have--
You're a finance guy.

00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,530
That's why
I'm not messing around.

00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,470
All the options available
to you.
Yeah, but when you go through
that cash,

00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,520
you still have to put it back
in. You have to put it back in.

00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,730
I'm giving you cash,

00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,800

the boards.

three offers on the table.

00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,950
Keep an eye on one thing here
as these offers come in,

00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,250
because it matters.

00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,370
You started with $1.5 million

00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,330
as for the value
of what you created here.

00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:50,020
Mark knocked you down 33%
to $900,000.

00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,180
These two very greedy sharks

00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,180
have knocked you down to half
of what you asked for.

00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,420
But also manufacturing is--
is a plus. That's--That's--

00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,370
factoring. He's--
It's just factoring, Mike.

00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,220
You're gonna have
the money anyway.

00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,250
(Daymond) It's not just
factoring. It's not at all.

00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,430
You're gonna wanna do apparel.

00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,030
You're gonna want
to do board shorts.

00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,250
You're gonna want to do
a bunch of things.

00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,150
No, you're not.
No, you're not.
We just--

00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,250
They're already selling
a lifestyle, Robert.

00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,200
No, no,
but not at the beginning.

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,080
The way they're gonna fail is by
doing too many things at once.

00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,270
They don't know that.
But they don't need to do

00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,400
too many things at once
if they have me on that side.

00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,300
(Kevin) You know what?

00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,280
I like Daymond's better.
I like the apparel thing.

00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,950
I think I want a piece
of your deal.
(Barbara) I want
to stop you right there.

00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,230
(Kevin) I like it better
than Mark's.

00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:31,170
(Barbara) I just want
to give you a word of caution.

00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,230
The best guy for you
on this deal is Mark Cuban.

00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,030
Smart lady.

00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,230
What? That's ridiculous. Why?

00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,050
You're honest,
you say it like it is,

00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,300
and you want to know something?
And you're crazy.

00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,230
No. You just be quiet, please.

00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,980
Mark's that way.
He's much richer than you,

00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,120
but he's cut out
of the same cloth. Right.

00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,430
Now what I'm going
to offer you is

00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:57,100
to take half of mark's position.

00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,970
(speaks indistinctly)
There you go.

00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,330
Wait! No. No. No.
Barbara, why don't you suck up
to everybody?

00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,400
No. No.
And it's totally up to mark.

00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,080
The reason you should listen is
nobody builds

00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,230
a faster, more well-run
sales network than I do.

00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,320
I know that--
Oh, that is absolute crap.
Mike--

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,370
No, that is so true.
Mike. Oh, come on.

00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,080
(Robert) Mike, I started
a company nine years ago...
(Barbara) So True.

00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,380
3 guys. We're 160 people today

00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,130
and $100 million in sales.

00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,070
We did $52 million last quarter.

00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:24,020
This is what this is.

00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,070
You've got a great plan.
You gotta execute.

00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,420
I rolled about six crossfit gyms
in the last four months

00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,100
as well
as a big training program.

00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,230
And if you know anything
about crossfit,

00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,170
it's very hard
to get certified.

00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,030
Yes, but he's a short man...

00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,280
(laughs)
And that doesn't figure image
at all.

00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,280
(mark laughs) Wow, Barbara.

00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,120
So, Mark, are you in
or are you out with Barbara?

00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:46,300
Sorry, Barbara.
I don't need you on this one.

00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,170
I'm going alone.

00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:51,130
Okay. In that case, I'm out.

00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,367
Do you want more money
than $150,000 today?

00:10:56,367 --> 00:10:58,287
I think that we could--

00:10:58,287 --> 00:11:01,057
that we could benefit
from more money right now.

00:11:01,057 --> 00:11:02,157
If we had more,
we could do it faster.

00:11:02,157 --> 00:11:04,200
If you have
a manufacturing pipeline,

00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,467
you don't need more money.

00:11:05,467 --> 00:11:07,417
When a business is
on the fast track,

00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,817
one of the biggest challenges
they have

00:11:09,817 --> 00:11:11,827
is to keep up
with success,

00:11:11,827 --> 00:11:14,547
because they don't have
enough cash available to them

00:11:14,547 --> 00:11:15,797
to meet demand,

00:11:15,797 --> 00:11:18,617
and then somebody else steps in
to meet that demand.

00:11:18,617 --> 00:11:20,767
And the quicker you get
to the point you need

00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:22,527
to preempt those competitors,

00:11:22,527 --> 00:11:24,647
the more successful
you're going to be.

00:11:24,647 --> 00:11:25,717
Let me throw in here
for a second,

00:11:25,717 --> 00:11:27,547
because I'm listening
to all this

00:11:27,547 --> 00:11:29,617
and I'm saying to myself,
you're either gonna execute

00:11:29,617 --> 00:11:32,427
and make this huge, 'cause I
believe you have that potential,

00:11:32,427 --> 00:11:35,427
and brand is a big part of it.

00:11:35,427 --> 00:11:37,697
The real lasting value
is not just that device.

00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,617
It's the brand
you're gonna create.

00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:41,817
The number one guy to build
a brand here is this guy.

00:11:41,817 --> 00:11:44,547
So I want to tack on
to his deal.

00:11:44,547 --> 00:11:46,567
I'll bring you in
on the deal.

00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:47,617
Yeah, I'd like to do that.

00:11:47,617 --> 00:11:48,867
Because they have to.

00:11:48,867 --> 00:11:50,477
Yeah.

00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:54,417
And This is where my
24-Second shot clock comes in,

00:11:54,417 --> 00:11:55,747
'cause I need a decision.

00:11:55,747 --> 00:11:58,467
$300,000 in cash

00:11:58,467 --> 00:11:59,617

00:11:59,617 --> 00:12:00,797
full partner.

00:12:00,797 --> 00:12:03,497
Should you need more
because business just explodes,

00:12:03,497 --> 00:12:04,527
there's more money there.

00:12:04,527 --> 00:12:05,727
I don't think you need
to give up

00:12:05,727 --> 00:12:06,877
one-third of your business
today.

00:12:06,877 --> 00:12:08,577
I think that would be foolish

00:12:08,577 --> 00:12:09,717
and I don't think
you guys are foolish.

00:12:09,717 --> 00:12:11,497
That's way too much.

00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:14,577
So, Mike, I'm giving you
$150,000 for 20%.

00:12:14,577 --> 00:12:16,647
Barbara's out.

00:12:16,647 --> 00:12:19,547
Daymond and Kevin are
$150,000 for 25%

Huh? Is there any way
to come down on any of that?

00:12:52,577 --> 00:12:53,777
You talking to me?
Yeah.

00:12:53,777 --> 00:12:55,847
A little bit.
A little bit on the, uh,
ownership?

00:12:55,847 --> 00:12:59,697
I'll come down to 30%

No, don't do it.

cost you $150,000.

Push, Sarah. You know
the right thing to do here.

00:13:17,677 --> 00:13:19,477
Mark, we're gonna accept
your offer.

00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:43,397
We got our first cereal order!

00:14:43,397 --> 00:14:45,497
Today's an exciting day
because we are launching

00:14:45,497 --> 00:14:48,427
our new product line,
element cereal.

00:14:48,427 --> 00:14:49,717
Element cereal is custom cereal.

00:14:49,717 --> 00:14:52,667
You pick the ingredients,
we bake it fresh for you,

00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:54,647
and then we ship it
to your house.

00:14:54,647 --> 00:14:56,517
And out the door.
Here's the first box.

00:14:56,517 --> 00:14:57,727
(man) Whoo!

00:14:57,727 --> 00:14:59,817
"Shark Tank" was a great
launching pad for our business.

00:14:59,817 --> 00:15:01,417
I'm so glad that I accepted
the challenge

00:15:01,417 --> 00:15:03,797
and took a dive into the tank
with the sharks.

00:15:03,797 --> 00:15:05,577
(all) Element cereal!

Aaron Marino,

00:15:16,734 --> 00:15:20,444
who believes he can help men
everywhere be more confident.

00:15:26,744 --> 00:15:28,066
Hello. I'm Aaron Marino,

00:15:28,066 --> 00:15:29,936
owner of Alpha M Consulting,

00:15:29,936 --> 00:15:32,966
and I'm here today seeking
a $50,000 investment

00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:35,886
for 10% equity stake
in my company.

00:15:35,886 --> 00:15:39,836
As men, we're motivated
by two things--Money

00:15:39,836 --> 00:15:42,186
and sex--And my company
helps them get more of both.

00:15:42,186 --> 00:15:43,936
Whoa.

00:15:43,936 --> 00:15:45,256
There were zero resources
out there

00:15:45,256 --> 00:15:46,936
for everyday average guys

00:15:46,936 --> 00:15:50,056
to get solid, basic advice
on how to look great.

00:15:50,056 --> 00:15:52,306
Now sure, there are a handful
of men's fashion magazines,

00:15:52,306 --> 00:15:56,266
but this is not reality
for 95% of us dudes out there.

00:15:56,266 --> 00:15:57,816
We don't care
what the latest brand

00:15:57,816 --> 00:15:59,286
of overpriced designer jeans
are.

00:15:59,286 --> 00:16:03,156
All we want to know is
hey, will chicks dig it?

00:16:03,156 --> 00:16:06,206
(sharks laugh)
Nobody ever teaches
or encourages us to look good,

00:16:06,206 --> 00:16:08,156
and when we do,
we're mocked and ridiculed,

00:16:08,156 --> 00:16:10,216
called names
like "metrosexual."

00:16:10,216 --> 00:16:13,116
To those people, I say,
"sit back and watch.

00:16:13,116 --> 00:16:15,836
"watch as my clients pass you
on the corporate ladder

00:16:15,836 --> 00:16:19,056
and get the number of the woman
who just rejected you."

00:16:19,056 --> 00:16:21,936
(laughs)
I have developed
a 6-Disc dvd series

00:16:21,936 --> 00:16:23,836
that helps a man analyze
and build

00:16:23,836 --> 00:16:25,916
the perfect basic wardrobe.

00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:26,966
Meet Joe.

00:16:26,966 --> 00:16:28,816
(Robert) What a slob.

00:16:28,816 --> 00:16:30,116
Joe is average,

00:16:30,116 --> 00:16:32,166
but by using
the alpha m style system,

00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:35,216
Joe can build
the perfect basic wardrobe,

00:16:35,216 --> 00:16:37,886
with a simple-to-follow
fashion formula.

00:16:37,886 --> 00:16:39,286
Joe's got a hot date.

00:16:39,286 --> 00:16:41,856
He follows the formula,
and Joe transforms

00:16:41,856 --> 00:16:44,186
from average Joe...

00:16:44,186 --> 00:16:46,166
(chimes tinkle)

00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:47,186
(Robert) whoa!

00:16:47,186 --> 00:16:49,256
To an alpha male.

00:16:49,256 --> 00:16:50,906
I'll take this Joe.
(Robert) Are they twins?

00:16:50,906 --> 00:16:53,056
Aaron, can we see
the other guy again?

00:16:53,056 --> 00:16:54,236
Can we compare the two?

00:16:54,236 --> 00:16:55,266
Yeah. Come on out.

00:16:55,266 --> 00:16:58,086
Tell me, if I buy the dvd,

00:16:58,086 --> 00:17:01,116
walk me through
how the dvd works.

00:17:01,116 --> 00:17:04,256
The foundation of the style
system is the inventory list.

00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:06,216
There are 59 essential items.

00:17:06,216 --> 00:17:10,116
Each item has a specific number
and letter code.

00:17:10,116 --> 00:17:11,816
Each outfit has a formula

00:17:11,816 --> 00:17:15,086
that correlates directly
to the inventory list.

00:17:15,086 --> 00:17:17,906
Right here.
This will explain it.

00:17:17,906 --> 00:17:20,906
Oh, I love your
"a.1 + b.2 + e.1 + g.1" outfit.

00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:22,206
That's very simple, by the way.

00:17:22,206 --> 00:17:24,816
(Mark and Robert laugh)

00:17:24,816 --> 00:17:27,856
Basically, that equation--
You get action.

00:17:27,856 --> 00:17:29,956
(Barbara and Robert laugh)

00:17:29,956 --> 00:17:31,916
All right,
and what city are you in?

00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,966
I'm in Atlanta,
but I'm--I'm worldwide.

00:17:33,966 --> 00:17:35,186
(laughs)
I'm a regular guy.

00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:38,086
I just happen to know more about
manscaping and shoes

00:17:38,086 --> 00:17:39,916
than I do football.

00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:40,966
(laughs)
And this is the way that I--

00:17:40,966 --> 00:17:42,236
manscaping?

00:17:42,236 --> 00:17:43,236
This is... (chuckles)
We'll talk.

00:17:43,236 --> 00:17:45,106
(Mark) Ha!

00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,216
Aaron, could you make anybody
better-Looking?

00:17:47,216 --> 00:17:48,306
Anybody.

00:17:48,306 --> 00:17:49,936
Can you make Kevin
better-looking?

00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:52,016
You tell us what you would do
with this guy.

00:17:52,016 --> 00:17:53,956
I think I'm very well-dressed
right now.

00:17:53,956 --> 00:17:55,056
(Barbara) And be quite honest
with this.

00:17:55,056 --> 00:17:57,266
Yeah, he would put a feed bag
on him.

00:17:57,266 --> 00:17:59,856
Other than the jacket being
a little bit too tight,

00:17:59,856 --> 00:18:00,906
it's not gonna be too much.

00:18:00,906 --> 00:18:02,166
No,
I'm 3 pounds overweight.

00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,266
Aaron, would you recommend
a hairpiece?

00:18:04,266 --> 00:18:07,156
No. Oh, no. That's one thing--
the brand.
Don't touch the brand.

00:18:07,156 --> 00:18:08,866
No. No. No. No. No.
One thing I would do...
just asking.

00:18:08,866 --> 00:18:10,256
I'd probably bring the sideburns
down a little bit,

00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,116
slightly angle them
to follow the jaw,

00:18:12,116 --> 00:18:13,306
and that's just gonna give
a little dimension to his face.

00:18:13,306 --> 00:18:15,186
I'd love that.
Eyebrows look good.

00:18:15,186 --> 00:18:18,216
Everything looks great. His
shoes are beautifully polished.

00:18:18,216 --> 00:18:20,056
I might just give this guy
10 grand for the heck of it.

00:18:20,056 --> 00:18:22,056
You're great.

00:18:22,056 --> 00:18:24,916
(Kevin) So what happens?
You get this slob guy.

00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,136
Mm-hmm.
He finds out about Alpha M.

00:18:26,136 --> 00:18:28,866
He tries this for how much?

00:18:28,866 --> 00:18:29,886
$297.

00:18:29,886 --> 00:18:31,906
Ooh.
(Robert) Ooh.

00:18:31,906 --> 00:18:34,116
How many have you sold
in the last six months?

00:18:34,116 --> 00:18:35,816
I actually just launched it.

00:18:35,816 --> 00:18:38,106
I sold 75 in 4 weeks.

00:18:38,106 --> 00:18:39,116
$75,000?

00:18:39,116 --> 00:18:41,986
75 units.

00:18:41,986 --> 00:18:45,016
This year I should project
around $250,000.

00:18:45,016 --> 00:18:48,256
First quarter, I did $61,000.
Uh, last month--

00:18:48,256 --> 00:18:49,916
Sorry, Aaron. Let's go back.

00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,056
How can you get to $61,000
in sales for the quarter

00:18:52,056 --> 00:18:53,266
when you've only sold 75 cds?

00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:56,266
I also--
I sell inter--Services.

00:18:56,266 --> 00:18:59,106
50% of my sales are local,
domestic.

00:18:59,106 --> 00:19:00,856
So included in your estimate
of sales...

00:19:00,856 --> 00:19:04,036
Mm-hmm.
Is you consulting with people,
right?

00:19:04,036 --> 00:19:07,286
Yeah. I may be shipping dvds,
but what I sell is confidence.

00:19:07,286 --> 00:19:08,956
Aaron.
(speaks indistinctly)

00:19:08,956 --> 00:19:11,006
I've been called
a bloodhound up here

00:19:11,006 --> 00:19:12,256
'cause I get
to the bottom of things.
Mm-hmm.

00:19:12,256 --> 00:19:15,266
So are you looking for us
to give you more than money,

00:19:15,266 --> 00:19:17,266
but give you access, help?

00:19:17,266 --> 00:19:19,906
I need help.
I need help with technology.

00:19:19,906 --> 00:19:22,156
I need help with
international distribution.

00:19:22,156 --> 00:19:26,816
And how much help would you like
me to put in on a weekly basis?

00:19:26,816 --> 00:19:29,886
(Robert) Full-time job, Daymond.

00:19:29,886 --> 00:19:34,306
The real truth is you want us
to work for you.

00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,156
Um...

00:19:36,156 --> 00:19:38,856
yes or no?
As a partner. Partner, yes.

00:19:38,856 --> 00:19:40,106
I'm out.

00:19:41,256 --> 00:19:43,036
Okay.

00:19:43,036 --> 00:19:45,306
I think you have
an interesting business,

00:19:45,306 --> 00:19:48,136
and I believe
that you found a niche,

00:19:48,136 --> 00:19:51,006
evidenced by the fact you're
taking in over $100,000.

00:19:51,006 --> 00:19:53,956
It's not a bad business.

00:19:53,956 --> 00:19:55,856
I'm not sure how leverageable
it is.

00:19:55,856 --> 00:19:57,216
You are the whole brand,

00:19:57,216 --> 00:20:00,956
so, I mean, a scenario that
I would be worried about is,

00:20:00,956 --> 00:20:03,136
one day you step out
into the street,

00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:04,966
and some guy wearing sandals
and white Socks,

00:20:04,966 --> 00:20:06,886
driving a bus, runs you over.

00:20:06,886 --> 00:20:08,106
(Daymond laughs)

00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:11,236
Kevin, I see my death
as an opportunity.

00:20:11,236 --> 00:20:15,306
You put "Style guardian Angel"
on there before...

00:20:15,306 --> 00:20:16,936
(sharks laugh)

00:20:16,936 --> 00:20:18,306
Hey, I put a white suit on,

00:20:18,306 --> 00:20:20,066
some fluffy clouds,
maybe a Harp,

00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:22,036
and I'm like,
"yo, alpha's checked out

00:20:22,036 --> 00:20:23,836
"to the big wardrobe
in the sky.

00:20:23,836 --> 00:20:25,306
I'm still here to be
your style guardian Angel."

00:20:25,306 --> 00:20:28,086
I love it.
What's really important,
what we learned today,

00:20:28,086 --> 00:20:29,306
is I'm the best-dressed shark,

00:20:29,306 --> 00:20:31,956
and I thank you for that.

00:20:31,956 --> 00:20:34,236
Oh, I don't think so.
But even with that on the table,

00:20:34,236 --> 00:20:36,966
I don't think
it's an investable business.

00:20:38,186 --> 00:20:39,186
I'm out.

00:20:41,056 --> 00:20:44,986
I think where you're off track
here is the dvd set,

00:20:44,986 --> 00:20:47,886
because I can't imagine
you selling that at--

00:20:47,886 --> 00:20:49,866
What was your price again?
$297.

00:20:49,866 --> 00:20:52,036
It's a ridiculous price.

00:20:52,036 --> 00:20:54,216
I think you're going down
the wrong path here.

00:20:54,216 --> 00:20:56,216
I'm out.

00:20:56,216 --> 00:20:57,986
What--
I'm sorry to cut you off.

00:20:57,986 --> 00:20:59,256
What's the price
of a compliment?

00:20:59,256 --> 00:21:02,956
I mean, what is the price
of getting a number of a woman?

00:21:02,956 --> 00:21:04,936
He's good.
You know what? He is good.

00:21:04,936 --> 00:21:07,166
I think
you're a great consultant,

00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:10,866
But the dvd--
I just don't see that working.

00:21:10,866 --> 00:21:14,266
I don't think the slob guy is
gonna buy a dvd

00:21:14,266 --> 00:21:17,866
and on his own, look like that.

00:21:20,136 --> 00:21:21,216
I'm out.

00:21:21,216 --> 00:21:24,116
Okay. Thank you.

00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,836
If I were to do this deal,

00:21:26,836 --> 00:21:28,206
and someone said to you,

00:21:28,206 --> 00:21:30,006
"who's your investor?"

00:21:30,006 --> 00:21:32,816
it's Mark Cuban,
and I'm looking like that?

00:21:32,816 --> 00:21:34,966
'cause I actually think that's
a better look than that look.

00:21:34,966 --> 00:21:36,306
Really?
(Robert laughs)

00:21:36,306 --> 00:21:39,236
There's no way you're gonna get
me wearing a tight sweater

00:21:39,236 --> 00:21:41,186
and folded-over and a tie.

00:21:41,186 --> 00:21:43,056
Right.
That's not gonna happen.

00:21:43,056 --> 00:21:46,006
So it's--It's just
not a good fit.
(Robert) Oh, come on.

00:21:46,006 --> 00:21:47,266
I appreciate it.
I understand.

00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:48,936
So for that reason, I'm out.

00:21:50,206 --> 00:21:52,056
Everybody's out?
(Daymond) Yes. Yes.

00:21:52,056 --> 00:21:54,086
I appreciate it.
Thank you for your time.
(Robert) Thank you.

00:21:54,086 --> 00:21:55,286
You all fantastic.

00:21:55,286 --> 00:21:57,186
Come on, guys.

00:21:57,186 --> 00:21:59,206
Bye, slob guy.

00:21:59,206 --> 00:22:01,006
(Aaron) That's okay.
You win some, you lose some.

And we opened up
an ice cream parlor

00:22:14,674 --> 00:22:16,634
in the heart
of Omaha, Nebraska.

00:22:16,634 --> 00:22:19,724
It's a very traditional
family-friendly ice cream store.

People have a connection
to ice cream.

We like to call it
a super comfort food.

Would you like to try a sample
of cinnamon cheesecake?

It makes you feel better.
It makes you happy.

You cannot have a frown
on your face

There's a need for our product
in the marketplace.

00:22:46,654 --> 00:22:49,684
We figured out a way to put
a new spin on ice cream.

00:22:49,684 --> 00:22:51,934
We're doing something
no one has ever done before.

We've really sacrificed a lot

00:22:54,674 --> 00:22:55,984

in this business.

We're on track to do $750,000.

Whoa.
And how much money
will you make on that?

00:25:06,784 --> 00:25:07,984
$60,000.
$60,000.

00:25:09,024 --> 00:25:11,884
Why are the margins so low?

00:25:11,884 --> 00:25:13,954
They're not low.
They're 60% margins.

00:25:13,954 --> 00:25:16,624
Well, then why?
Where's all the money going?

00:25:16,624 --> 00:25:17,774
$750,000 in sales.

00:25:17,774 --> 00:25:19,984
You're only making $60,000
on that.

00:25:19,984 --> 00:25:22,904
We have spent a significant
amount of money

00:25:22,904 --> 00:25:25,804
into building
a very solid infrastructure.

00:25:25,804 --> 00:25:28,024
This is a great time
for you guys to be involved.

00:25:28,024 --> 00:25:29,634
This is the tipping point.

00:25:29,634 --> 00:25:31,884
We have invested
into our machinery,

00:25:31,884 --> 00:25:33,684
into tried and True recipes,

00:25:33,684 --> 00:25:35,074
the process
of shipping ice cream,

00:25:35,074 --> 00:25:37,854
which isn't as easy
as it may seem.

00:25:37,854 --> 00:25:39,724
Yeah, Becky, how do you ship it
without it melting?

00:25:39,724 --> 00:25:42,724
We ship it in a reusable cooler
on dry ice.

00:25:42,724 --> 00:25:43,954
How much does that cost?

00:25:43,954 --> 00:25:47,104
We sell a 4-Pint ice cream gift

00:25:47,104 --> 00:25:49,984
for an average of $55
on our site.

00:25:49,984 --> 00:25:51,884
Plus shipping.
Shipping, right.

00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:54,784
So second-Day air is $25.

00:25:54,784 --> 00:25:56,034
Who pays for that?
The customer.

00:25:56,034 --> 00:25:57,854
The customer.
The customer pays for it.

00:25:57,854 --> 00:25:59,104
So they end up paying
$75 for the gift?
$80.

00:25:59,104 --> 00:26:00,684
Yeah.
Yes.

00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,934
Even as a gift, $80
is very, very expensive

00:26:02,934 --> 00:26:04,874
for four pints
of ice cream.

00:26:04,874 --> 00:26:07,004
What we like to say is,
the last time you sent flowers,

00:26:07,004 --> 00:26:08,804
what did you spend?

00:26:08,804 --> 00:26:10,834
But that's exactly the point.
I don't think that's expensive.

00:26:10,834 --> 00:26:12,024
'cause every time
I do something wrong

00:26:12,024 --> 00:26:13,084
and my wife yells at me,

00:26:13,084 --> 00:26:15,004
I'm spending at least
$250 for roses.

00:26:15,004 --> 00:26:17,054
We have an all-apologies
pack of ice cream.

00:26:17,054 --> 00:26:19,104
Do you make
the ice cream yourselves?

00:26:19,104 --> 00:26:20,104
Yes.
Yes.

00:26:20,104 --> 00:26:21,104
Why?

00:26:21,104 --> 00:26:22,804
Like we said before,

00:26:22,804 --> 00:26:24,834
you can't look at this
as 16 ounces of cream and sugar.

00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:27,754
This is a personalized,
heartfelt message.

00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:28,834
And I... (laughs)

00:26:28,834 --> 00:26:30,724
Maybe I should direct
the conversation.

00:26:30,724 --> 00:26:32,774
I know how you feel
about that.

00:26:32,774 --> 00:26:34,754
I love the idea.

00:26:34,754 --> 00:26:36,984
I mean, I think
if you sell it as ice cream,

00:26:36,984 --> 00:26:38,974
it's very expensive.

00:26:38,974 --> 00:26:40,984
But if you sell it
as a lifestyle experience,

00:26:40,984 --> 00:26:42,734
it's not.

00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,634
Okay. What are you doing
for customer acquisition,

00:26:44,634 --> 00:26:46,654
and what is your cost
for customer acquisition?

00:26:46,654 --> 00:26:48,924
We are spending all
of our marketing budget

00:26:48,924 --> 00:26:52,034
on online advertising.
What does it cost you
to get a customer?

00:26:52,034 --> 00:26:53,684
$20 a customer,

00:26:53,684 --> 00:26:55,734
but that customer's
going to repeat purchase.

00:26:55,734 --> 00:26:57,804
How many times?
Right now, average customers

00:26:57,804 --> 00:26:59,054
are purchasing
about twice a year.

00:26:59,054 --> 00:27:00,934
Okay. And my profit
on a customer?

00:27:00,934 --> 00:27:02,934
Our margins are 60%.

00:27:02,934 --> 00:27:04,054
But let's step back.

00:27:04,054 --> 00:27:05,684
You said you were
lifestyle guys?

00:27:05,684 --> 00:27:06,984
How did you get
into this business?

00:27:06,984 --> 00:27:08,634
With our investor,

00:27:08,634 --> 00:27:11,754
we purchased a non-Functioning
ice cream Web site.

00:27:11,754 --> 00:27:13,804
We rebuilt it
and repositioned it

00:27:13,804 --> 00:27:15,674
as an ice cream gift site.

00:27:15,674 --> 00:27:17,824
How much does your investor
own of the company?

00:27:17,824 --> 00:27:18,824
70%.
70%?

00:27:18,824 --> 00:27:20,774
Oh!
Wow.

00:27:20,774 --> 00:27:22,634
Whoa. And how much
did they put in, Abby?
Wow. How much did they put in?

00:27:22,634 --> 00:27:23,884
He put in $600,000.

00:27:23,884 --> 00:27:25,724
Oh!
Was it Warren Buffet?

00:27:25,724 --> 00:27:28,054
He gave you close to
a million-Dollar valuation

00:27:28,054 --> 00:27:29,804
from a concept
about ice cream?

00:27:29,804 --> 00:27:30,904
He is a venture capitalist.

00:27:30,904 --> 00:27:33,674
He is very successful
in--in the e-Commerce space.

00:27:33,674 --> 00:27:35,034
He wants one of you guys.

00:27:35,034 --> 00:27:36,104
I'm sure.

00:27:36,104 --> 00:27:38,904
And you are offering us
33% of the company?

00:27:38,904 --> 00:27:40,984
Does this investor--
Is he aware of this?

00:27:40,984 --> 00:27:42,104
Yes.
Absolutely.

00:27:42,104 --> 00:27:43,884
He's--he's--
It's out of his share?

00:27:43,884 --> 00:27:44,974
It's of his share.

00:27:44,974 --> 00:27:46,854
We want your capital
and your connections,

00:27:46,854 --> 00:27:49,004
'cause we know that we can
take this to the next level.

00:27:49,004 --> 00:27:50,724
What do you think
it's gonna take

00:27:50,724 --> 00:27:51,874
to get you
to the next level?

00:27:51,874 --> 00:27:54,054
We want the capital
for a production facility.

00:27:54,054 --> 00:27:56,884
We make and ship
and sell everything

00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:58,634
out of our ice cream parlor.

00:27:58,634 --> 00:27:59,784
Is there value today

00:27:59,784 --> 00:28:02,084
to have a retail,
bricks and mortar presence

00:28:02,084 --> 00:28:03,804
and an online presence?

00:28:03,804 --> 00:28:05,824
In other words,
if you shut down the retail,

00:28:05,824 --> 00:28:08,074
would the online
be more profitable?

00:28:08,074 --> 00:28:10,104
Yes, it would.

00:28:12,934 --> 00:28:14,804
I'm getting intrigued,
I have to admit.

00:28:16,874 --> 00:28:19,654
I'll make you an offer.

00:28:19,654 --> 00:28:22,754
Because I also value
promotion--

00:28:22,754 --> 00:28:24,104
I don't know which of
the other shark or sharkettes

00:28:24,104 --> 00:28:25,784
would be interested,

00:28:25,784 --> 00:28:31,634
but I'll give you
$125,000 for 25%.

00:28:31,634 --> 00:28:33,754
But the price is $250,000.

00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:36,104
I heard that.
Well, he needs
a partner, Barbara.

00:28:36,104 --> 00:28:38,834
That's such
a bogus strategy, though.

00:28:40,674 --> 00:28:41,704
If you like it...
really?

00:28:41,704 --> 00:28:42,804
If you wanna be in,
you can be in.

00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:43,854
If not, be quiet.

00:28:43,854 --> 00:28:46,104
If you want it--250k.

00:28:46,104 --> 00:28:47,834
No.
You know?
Another shark? Come on.

00:28:47,834 --> 00:28:49,004
No, because I think
the problem with this deal is,

00:28:49,004 --> 00:28:50,924
the cost of customer
acquisition is huge.

00:28:50,924 --> 00:28:53,054
They need a massive amount
of promotion.

00:28:53,054 --> 00:28:55,754
I think the problem
with the deal is,

00:28:55,754 --> 00:28:59,934
they have one of the guys
like us behind them.

00:28:59,934 --> 00:29:02,074
I'm not gonna give up
my money and my time

00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:07,684
for somebody else who owns
70% of the company.

00:29:07,684 --> 00:29:08,684
I'm out.

00:29:11,954 --> 00:29:14,674
I love the idea.

00:29:16,874 --> 00:29:18,824
But you got online,
you got bricks and mortar,

00:29:18,824 --> 00:29:19,984
you got another investor.

00:29:19,984 --> 00:29:21,684
There's just too much
going on.

00:29:21,684 --> 00:29:22,804
I'm out.
We're ready to focus
on the online.

00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:24,004
We know that's
what's going to scale.

00:29:24,004 --> 00:29:25,634
So Robert's point--

00:29:25,634 --> 00:29:27,624
The best idea here
that I've heard,

00:29:27,624 --> 00:29:29,904
is to shut down your store.

00:29:29,904 --> 00:29:32,004
I don't really think
you need a partner here.

00:29:32,004 --> 00:29:35,774
I think you need
a loan of some kind.

00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,884
I'm out.

00:29:37,884 --> 00:29:39,074
Well, we're
very disappointed.

00:29:39,074 --> 00:29:40,904
We were really
looking forward to...

00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,624
I would love
to have you as partners,

00:29:42,624 --> 00:29:44,104
but I would never
get my money out,

00:29:44,104 --> 00:29:46,724
and I would start
to hate you.

00:29:46,724 --> 00:29:48,674
Whoa. Nasty.

00:29:48,674 --> 00:29:50,654
Wow. This is
a tough sale, girls.

00:29:50,654 --> 00:29:54,684
I'm throwing a bone out here,
and nobody's biting.

00:29:54,684 --> 00:29:56,834
Mark, where are you at?

00:29:56,834 --> 00:29:58,984
I think it's
a brilliant idea.

00:29:58,984 --> 00:30:00,024
Thank you.

00:30:00,024 --> 00:30:02,874
But there's a saying
that I love.

00:30:02,874 --> 00:30:04,634
It says, "first,
there's the innovators,

00:30:04,634 --> 00:30:06,084
"then there's the imitators,

00:30:06,084 --> 00:30:09,634
then there's the idiots."

00:30:09,634 --> 00:30:12,654
You're the innovator.

00:30:12,654 --> 00:30:16,104
The problem is, you haven't
been imitated yet.

00:30:16,104 --> 00:30:19,934
Because it's such
a good idea, you will be.

00:30:19,934 --> 00:30:21,724
As you get more successful,

00:30:21,724 --> 00:30:23,034
people are going to say,
"you know what?

00:30:23,034 --> 00:30:24,934
"I can do this locally.

00:30:24,934 --> 00:30:28,924
I don't have
the $25 shipping cost."

00:30:28,924 --> 00:30:30,704
For that reason,
I'm out.

00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:36,074
(Daymond) You have one shark
left to deal with.

00:30:36,074 --> 00:30:37,934
The meanest guy here.
That's the good news.

00:30:37,934 --> 00:30:38,984
The bad news is...

00:30:38,984 --> 00:30:40,754
it's Kevin.
It's Kevin.

00:30:40,754 --> 00:30:41,824
(Mark and Barbara laugh)

00:30:41,824 --> 00:30:44,084
Well, all good roads
lead to uncle kev.

00:30:44,084 --> 00:30:45,934
(Robert) And he's only
giving you half the money.

00:30:45,934 --> 00:30:47,904
The reason I did that
is I figure

00:30:47,904 --> 00:30:50,634
this thing is a massive
promotional challenge,

00:30:50,634 --> 00:30:52,734
because you're
educating America

00:30:52,734 --> 00:30:54,004
that ice cream is a gift.

00:30:54,004 --> 00:30:56,074
And by the way,
it's really good.

00:30:56,074 --> 00:30:59,084
The best ice cream
I've ever had, bar none.
Yeah. It is fantastic.

00:30:59,084 --> 00:31:00,834
We're--We're going
to make this

00:31:00,834 --> 00:31:04,074
a $5 million business
just in the next 3 years.

00:31:04,074 --> 00:31:06,824
Ladies, I have bad news.

00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:09,724
Please--Please reconsider
matching the offer

00:31:09,724 --> 00:31:11,784
so we can build
a production facility.
But because of the greed

00:31:11,784 --> 00:31:13,684
of these other sharks...
(laughter)

00:31:13,684 --> 00:31:14,684
I'm stuck.
I can't do anything.

00:31:14,684 --> 00:31:16,004
So what are you gonna do?

00:31:16,004 --> 00:31:17,724
I'm out.

00:31:21,854 --> 00:31:24,824
Thank you for tasting it,
for trying it, for loving it.

00:31:24,824 --> 00:31:25,824
Good luck.
Terrific job.

00:31:25,824 --> 00:31:26,824
Thank you.

00:31:29,624 --> 00:31:30,954
The sharks loved
our ice cream.

00:31:30,954 --> 00:31:33,804
They're crazy for not taking
this sweet deal,

00:31:33,804 --> 00:31:36,724
and we're even more motivated
to make ecreamery

00:31:36,724 --> 00:31:38,804
a household name
across America.

Hi. I'm Neil Desai,

00:32:02,203 --> 00:32:03,413
and I'm the owner
of Cate app.

00:32:03,413 --> 00:32:05,133
I'm seeking $50,000

00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:07,163
for a 5% equity stake
in my company.

00:32:07,163 --> 00:32:09,213
Now whether or not
we like it,

00:32:09,213 --> 00:32:11,283
we all know someone
who's been cheated on,

00:32:11,283 --> 00:32:12,553
been accused of cheating,

00:32:12,553 --> 00:32:14,433
or who's actually cheated.

00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:16,253
(laughs)
Let me show you
a situation

00:32:16,253 --> 00:32:18,453
that happens to millions
of people every day.

00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:21,313

00:32:23,463 --> 00:32:25,233
Who is that?

00:32:25,233 --> 00:32:27,153
(laughs)
Oh, it's nobody.

00:32:29,363 --> 00:32:31,133
What is this?!

00:32:31,133 --> 00:32:34,153
Jenny? Jenny
from your work?

00:32:34,153 --> 00:32:36,463
Yeah. I mean--
What is this?
Are you cheating on me?

00:32:36,463 --> 00:32:38,513
No! I'm not--
You liar!

00:32:38,513 --> 00:32:39,513
(smacks)
Ah!

00:32:39,513 --> 00:32:41,383
(sharks laugh)

00:32:41,383 --> 00:32:43,503
Have you been there,
Kevin?

00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,503
Whoa!

00:32:44,503 --> 00:32:47,233
Tell--Tell me more.

00:32:47,233 --> 00:32:50,263
Well, Cate helps prevent
fights like this

00:32:50,263 --> 00:32:53,063
simply by Keeping
your indiscretions discreet.

00:32:53,063 --> 00:32:55,113
Quite simply, Cate is
a smartphone application,

00:32:55,113 --> 00:32:57,513
and with it, you select
a blacklist of contacts.

00:32:57,513 --> 00:32:59,453
And if those contacts
call or text you,

00:32:59,453 --> 00:33:01,413
Cate will intercept
those calls and texts

00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:03,313
and store it
within its interface.

00:33:03,313 --> 00:33:04,483
So even if
your significant other

00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,133
is looking directly
at your phone

00:33:06,133 --> 00:33:08,133
when a blacklist contact
Calls or texts you,

00:33:08,133 --> 00:33:09,453
she'll have no idea
it happened.

00:33:09,453 --> 00:33:12,253
Let's just say
if tiger had Cate,

00:33:12,253 --> 00:33:14,203
he might still
be married to Elin.

00:33:14,203 --> 00:33:16,303
(laughter)

00:33:16,303 --> 00:33:18,263
It's been estimated
that 80% of marriages

00:33:18,263 --> 00:33:20,233
have at least
one cheating partner.

00:33:20,233 --> 00:33:21,453
Shut up.

00:33:21,453 --> 00:33:22,453
For real.

00:33:22,453 --> 00:33:24,503
(laughs)
We like to say,

00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:27,113
"Love is blind.
We keep it that way."

00:33:27,113 --> 00:33:29,463
So, Neil, this is
a cheater's app?

00:33:29,463 --> 00:33:31,363
But in reality,
it's a privacy app.

00:33:31,363 --> 00:33:32,553
But let's call a spade a spade.

00:33:32,553 --> 00:33:34,213
That's fine.
It's a cheater's app.

00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:36,153
I'm okay with that.
It's a cheater's app.

00:33:36,153 --> 00:33:39,203
(laughter)
Good for you, Neil.
Go with it, baby. Own it.

00:33:39,203 --> 00:33:41,183
Neil...
for ex--Yes?

00:33:41,183 --> 00:33:42,463
Why did you develop this?

00:33:42,463 --> 00:33:45,353
You don't seem like
the cheater type of guy.

00:33:45,353 --> 00:33:46,453
You are correct.

00:33:46,453 --> 00:33:49,303
But I didn't actually
develop the app.

00:33:49,303 --> 00:33:52,183
What I've done, pretty much
since I was 14,

00:33:52,183 --> 00:33:53,353
I was a hustler.

00:33:53,353 --> 00:33:55,203
I sold pokemon cards
on ebay.

00:33:55,203 --> 00:33:56,203
I went to college,

00:33:56,203 --> 00:33:58,183
did the 4-Year degree thing,

00:33:58,183 --> 00:34:01,233
but I couldn't get a job
that I really wanted.

00:34:01,233 --> 00:34:03,213
Went back to pokemon cards.

00:34:03,213 --> 00:34:04,503
I found the app.

00:34:04,503 --> 00:34:06,153
But you're not
a developer, right?

00:34:06,153 --> 00:34:07,433
You didn't develop this?
No.

00:34:07,433 --> 00:34:08,433
Tell us
the story there.

00:34:08,433 --> 00:34:10,083
How did you find it?
What--What happened?

00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:12,103
I found a guy
selling this app.

00:34:12,103 --> 00:34:14,233
It turns out to be a cop.

00:34:14,233 --> 00:34:15,363
He doesn't have time
for this app.

00:34:15,363 --> 00:34:17,213
So a cop developed
a cheater's app?

00:34:17,213 --> 00:34:18,253
Correct.

00:34:18,253 --> 00:34:19,253
(laughs)

00:34:19,253 --> 00:34:20,533
How much
did you pay the cop?

00:34:20,533 --> 00:34:22,503
$17,500.

00:34:22,503 --> 00:34:24,333
You paid him $17,500? Wow.

00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:26,533
So you have 100%
ownership of this?

00:34:26,533 --> 00:34:28,503
Between me and my sister,
yes. We're a team.

00:34:28,503 --> 00:34:30,353
Is your app
totally developed already?

00:34:30,353 --> 00:34:32,233
It's finished?
It's developed.

00:34:32,233 --> 00:34:34,533
We--We just finished
the iphone version of it

00:34:34,533 --> 00:34:36,353
a week or two ago,

00:34:36,353 --> 00:34:38,313
so we have android,
iphone, and blackberry,

00:34:38,313 --> 00:34:41,313
which covers 85% of
the cell phone market, and--
So, Neil,

00:34:41,313 --> 00:34:44,213
how much are you
invested in it, all--Total?

00:34:44,213 --> 00:34:45,213
We're...
to date?

00:34:45,213 --> 00:34:47,233
Roughly around
$45,000, currently.

00:34:47,233 --> 00:34:50,403
I don't know if cheating
is good or bad,

00:34:50,403 --> 00:34:51,483
'cause I've never done it,

00:34:51,483 --> 00:34:54,213
but I do understand
there are people that have,

00:34:54,213 --> 00:34:56,063
and they need
a product like this.
Yeah.

00:34:56,063 --> 00:34:59,403
So why don't you tell me
a little bit about your sales?

00:34:59,403 --> 00:35:04,103
So far, we have around
10,000 customers, and...

00:35:04,103 --> 00:35:06,203
You have 10,000
paid customers?

00:35:06,203 --> 00:35:09,233
5,500, roughly,
paid customers,

00:35:09,233 --> 00:35:11,403
and about 4,000
free customers.

00:35:11,403 --> 00:35:14,533
Now--
How much did
the 5,500 who paid for it,

00:35:14,533 --> 00:35:16,503
the actual cheaters,
what did they pay?

00:35:16,503 --> 00:35:19,113
The app sells
for $4.99

00:35:19,113 --> 00:35:21,253
for android and iphone,

00:35:21,253 --> 00:35:22,553
and $9.99 for blackberry.

00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:25,433
All right. So for--in three
months, you've sold how much?

00:35:25,433 --> 00:35:27,463
It's about $5,000
to $5,500,

00:35:27,463 --> 00:35:30,403
and $4,000 of that
is profit.
And today you think

00:35:30,403 --> 00:35:32,083
that app, based on that,

00:35:32,083 --> 00:35:34,333
is worth $1 million?
$1 million.

00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:36,403
Yes!
I think you're cheating.

00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:41,083
Neil, why are you offering us
such little percentage?

00:35:41,083 --> 00:35:43,163
Do you really want a deal?

00:35:43,163 --> 00:35:45,253
I do. And to be
perfectly honest,

00:35:45,253 --> 00:35:47,313
I know the equity
is negotiable.

00:35:47,313 --> 00:35:50,163
So I figure I should
come here with that,

00:35:50,163 --> 00:35:52,153
and leave it
up to you guys.

00:35:52,153 --> 00:35:55,203
But--But, Neil,
do you have any issues

00:35:55,203 --> 00:35:59,503
or concerns about the morality
of the product you're promoting?

00:35:59,503 --> 00:36:02,203
Let's put it this way--
What are you
talking about?

00:36:02,203 --> 00:36:04,513
Let the guy answer a question.

00:36:04,513 --> 00:36:07,083
It's okay. I'm okay. I-I'm okay
with you guys fighting.
I'm answering for you.
The answer is "No."

00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:09,263
It's "no."

00:36:09,263 --> 00:36:11,083
I'll just put it
in a better way.

00:36:11,083 --> 00:36:14,083
Let's say you didn't like
carrots, for example.

00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:15,133
Carrots?
Carrots.

00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:17,303
But carrots sold
at 100% markup.

00:36:17,303 --> 00:36:18,383
Are you gonna say,

00:36:18,383 --> 00:36:19,453
"I don't wanna be
a carrot farmer,"

00:36:19,453 --> 00:36:21,133
or are you going to
jump into that business,

00:36:21,133 --> 00:36:22,253
ready to make money?

00:36:22,253 --> 00:36:23,353
(laughs) In other words,

00:36:23,353 --> 00:36:24,483
you're gonna go
where the money is,

00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:25,503
is what you're saying.
Of course.

00:36:25,503 --> 00:36:27,203
This is not "morality tank."

00:36:27,203 --> 00:36:29,203
The only immoral aspect
of your deal

00:36:29,203 --> 00:36:30,463
is the crazy valuation.

00:36:30,463 --> 00:36:32,233
It's not worth
a million dollars.

00:36:33,453 --> 00:36:35,513
That's for you guys
to decide.

00:36:35,513 --> 00:36:38,403
That's what I think
it's worth.
Well, I think we're
telling you right now.

00:36:38,403 --> 00:36:39,453
Look, I'm not gonna sit around
and listen anymore.

00:36:39,453 --> 00:36:41,133
I understand the business.

00:36:41,133 --> 00:36:43,313
I'll give you
the $50,000 for 50%.

00:36:45,533 --> 00:36:47,463
I'd like to hear
the other offers.

00:36:50,113 --> 00:36:51,453
Are there any other apps

00:36:51,453 --> 00:36:54,433
that you could use this
programming code Base for

00:36:54,433 --> 00:36:56,103
that you've considered?

00:36:56,103 --> 00:36:58,063
What do you mean?

00:36:58,063 --> 00:36:59,353
Let me give you one
right now.

00:36:59,353 --> 00:37:01,063
In the mutual fund industry,

00:37:01,063 --> 00:37:02,333
competitors don't like
their sales data

00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:04,103
to be shown on a phone.

00:37:04,103 --> 00:37:06,203
I'm gonna use this
in my business

00:37:06,203 --> 00:37:08,183
on all
the sales reports.
That's exactly--

00:37:08,183 --> 00:37:10,383
So I think there are apps
that will make sense there,

00:37:10,383 --> 00:37:11,503
and this is one of them.

00:37:11,503 --> 00:37:13,303
And they're--
It's really there,

00:37:13,303 --> 00:37:15,403
if nothing else,
to prevent fights. If--

00:37:15,403 --> 00:37:17,313
to prevent what?
Fights.

00:37:17,313 --> 00:37:21,063
Like, a lot of--a lot
of girlfriends that I've known

00:37:21,063 --> 00:37:23,463
have had boyfriends
who are overly jealous.

00:37:23,463 --> 00:37:25,163
And they have guy friends,

00:37:25,163 --> 00:37:26,553
and the boyfriend doesn't
want to see the guy friend

00:37:26,553 --> 00:37:27,553
text message her.

00:37:27,553 --> 00:37:29,283
So you get to keep
your friends

00:37:29,283 --> 00:37:30,453
and keep
your boyfriend happy,

00:37:30,453 --> 00:37:31,533
and everyone is happy.
And you might keep them alive.

00:37:31,533 --> 00:37:33,383
See, you're saving
peoples' lives.

00:37:33,383 --> 00:37:34,503
(Daymond) You're saving lives!
That's what I think I'm doing.

00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:36,483
Yeah. I'm like
a firefighter.

00:37:36,483 --> 00:37:38,103
(sharks laugh)

00:37:38,103 --> 00:37:39,403
I like your passion,

00:37:39,403 --> 00:37:42,133
I like the fact
that you're a hustler.

00:37:42,133 --> 00:37:44,233
I don't like the app,
so I'm out.

00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:49,233
There's a web site out there
that promotes cheating.

00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:50,403
I know it.

00:37:50,403 --> 00:37:52,213
The guy who runs it
and owns it

00:37:52,213 --> 00:37:54,303
is a very close
personal friend of mine.

00:37:54,303 --> 00:37:57,183
We summer together.
That's good.

00:37:57,183 --> 00:37:59,363
I'm going right to him
after we form our partnership.

00:37:59,363 --> 00:38:01,253
Now it's hard for me
to believe that you don't cheat.

00:38:01,253 --> 00:38:03,463
I don't cheat.
(sharks laugh)

00:38:03,463 --> 00:38:06,103
I'm kidding.
I don't cheat.

00:38:06,103 --> 00:38:08,153
I believe in what
you believe in, okay?

00:38:08,153 --> 00:38:10,303
I know the only thing
that matters in life is what?

00:38:10,303 --> 00:38:12,183
Money. Yes.
Money. Of course.

00:38:12,183 --> 00:38:14,463
You and me, we are in sync.

00:38:14,463 --> 00:38:18,283
I'm gonna give you $50,000
right now for 50%. Let's go.

00:38:18,283 --> 00:38:19,403
I have to hear
the rest of the offers.

00:38:19,403 --> 00:38:21,163
Well, do we have
any other offers?

00:38:21,163 --> 00:38:23,213
Neil, I'll make it--
I'll make it very simple.

00:38:23,213 --> 00:38:24,313
I have a different philosophy.

00:38:24,313 --> 00:38:25,403
I don't think
it's all about money.

00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:26,513
I-I don't wanna be--
You're wrong.

00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:28,163
I don't wanna be involved
in any business

00:38:28,163 --> 00:38:30,383
where I can't
bring my kids to work.

00:38:31,433 --> 00:38:33,103
I'm out.

00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:36,203
Daymond, what are you doing?

00:38:36,203 --> 00:38:37,253
I have to be very honest.

00:38:37,253 --> 00:38:38,413
This is not my field.

00:38:38,413 --> 00:38:41,083
So what I would like
to do,

00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:43,253
if he would allow me--
and I would be partners

00:38:43,253 --> 00:38:45,253
with Kevin
to make this a stronger deal,

00:38:45,253 --> 00:38:46,533
if he allows me in.

00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:49,263
All right. I'm interested
and I'm gonna agree.

00:38:49,263 --> 00:38:52,203
(Robert) So Kevin and Daymond
are in at $50,000

00:38:52,203 --> 00:38:53,453
for 50%.

00:38:53,453 --> 00:38:55,383
You have a hard offer
on the table.

00:38:55,383 --> 00:38:57,333
What are you going
to do?

00:38:58,513 --> 00:39:01,513
You know, I happen to love,
uh, this concept.

00:39:01,513 --> 00:39:05,203
Um, I happen to think
it has enormous application.

00:39:05,203 --> 00:39:08,183
All right? My husband
was an FBI agent,

00:39:08,183 --> 00:39:10,533
and used to have snitches
in white-collar crime

00:39:10,533 --> 00:39:12,203
that would call him.

00:39:12,203 --> 00:39:13,333
And the biggest problem was,

00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:15,103
they didn't want
their name on his cell phone.

00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:16,253
Oh, for sure.

00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:18,153
If it wasn't narrowed
as a cheater's app

00:39:18,153 --> 00:39:19,463
and it was a privacy app,

00:39:19,463 --> 00:39:22,063
I think it has a tremendous
amount of application.

00:39:22,063 --> 00:39:23,453
So I'd like
to make you an offer.

00:39:28,313 --> 00:39:31,253
♪♪♪

00:39:34,133 --> 00:39:37,203
♪♪♪

00:39:37,203 --> 00:39:38,913
Two sharks are out.

00:39:38,913 --> 00:39:40,253
Neil has one offer
on the table

00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:41,853
from Kevin and Daymond,

00:39:41,853 --> 00:39:43,883
But Barbara
wants in on the action.

00:39:43,883 --> 00:39:45,213
So I'd like to make you
an offer

00:39:45,213 --> 00:39:48,113
for $50,000
for 30% of your business,

00:39:48,113 --> 00:39:50,063
provided you're open
to repositioning it

00:39:50,063 --> 00:39:53,133
as a privacy app
versus a cheater's app.

00:39:53,133 --> 00:39:56,063
You know, this is one of
these situations

00:39:56,063 --> 00:39:57,103
where you have to decide--

00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,233
You can work
with a real estate Agent

00:39:58,233 --> 00:40:00,083
who has no history
in software at all,

00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:01,853
and I'm being nice
when I say that...

00:40:01,853 --> 00:40:03,153
let me tell you
what I was successful in.

00:40:03,153 --> 00:40:05,883
I was successful
in taking a $1,000 loan

00:40:05,883 --> 00:40:09,033
and building it into
a $5 billion business.

00:40:09,033 --> 00:40:10,853
So don't pull that card
on me, Kevin.

00:40:10,853 --> 00:40:12,933
I am just--
I know that I don't know
as much as Barbara.

00:40:12,933 --> 00:40:15,313
That's why I would have to
come in with Kevin,

00:40:15,313 --> 00:40:17,163
because together,
collectively,

00:40:17,163 --> 00:40:20,233
we can offer you
that muscle you need.

00:40:20,233 --> 00:40:22,303
Counter them.

00:40:22,303 --> 00:40:25,203
I'll offer you guys 15%.

00:40:25,203 --> 00:40:27,003
Whoa.
Whoa. Hang on.

00:40:27,003 --> 00:40:29,153
Whoa. Neil...
yes! You take it,
Neil.

00:40:29,153 --> 00:40:31,183
You're countering
to all three of them...
yes.

00:40:31,183 --> 00:40:33,163
15% for $50,000.

00:40:33,163 --> 00:40:34,853
Correct.

00:40:37,113 --> 00:40:39,883
We're not in the same
universe on this one.
(Barbara) Not me, no.

00:40:39,883 --> 00:40:41,853
No, thank you.
It's all negotiation.

00:40:41,853 --> 00:40:43,333
It's all up to negotiation.
It's a start-up act, Neil.

00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:45,213
You're not--You're not
known anywhere yet.

00:40:45,213 --> 00:40:46,883
You wanna bet?

00:40:46,883 --> 00:40:48,313
If you want
a cheater's app,

00:40:48,313 --> 00:40:50,203
if you want
big market exposure,

00:40:50,203 --> 00:40:51,883
this is it.

00:40:51,883 --> 00:40:55,333
All right. Let's stop
screwing around, okay, Neil?

00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:59,013
You can do this whole thing
on your own, all right?

00:40:59,013 --> 00:41:01,903
Yeah.
Or you can partner
with Daymond and I.

00:41:01,903 --> 00:41:02,953
Yeah.

00:41:02,953 --> 00:41:05,983
I'll drop this down
to 35% for 50k,

00:41:05,983 --> 00:41:07,083
the two of us
are still in the deal?
I agree.

00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:08,263
But it ain't gonna get
any cheaper.

00:41:08,263 --> 00:41:10,033
You know what? That's gonna be
my last on this one,

00:41:10,033 --> 00:41:12,203
because he's gonna start talking
his way out of this. So...

00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:15,133
look, I think the two of us
bring So much value to you

00:41:15,133 --> 00:41:16,853
that we have to get paid for it.

00:41:16,853 --> 00:41:19,233
Neil, this is
your deal to lose.

00:41:19,233 --> 00:41:22,163
Neil, you have
another offer on the table.

00:41:22,163 --> 00:41:24,853
It's a better deal.
It's Only for 30%

00:41:24,853 --> 00:41:26,333
for the $50,000.

00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:29,133
You're telling me
for five points...
what are you gonna do?

00:41:29,133 --> 00:41:31,203
You're not coming with me?
Are you out of your mind?

00:41:31,203 --> 00:41:34,063
Do you want to call him
and look at that guy every day?

00:41:34,063 --> 00:41:37,063
Neil, who do you see
more value in?

00:41:37,063 --> 00:41:39,033
I'm sorry, Barbara,
I really do see value in him.

00:41:39,033 --> 00:41:40,083
You know what I'll do?

00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:41,963
I'll drop it down to 25%.

00:41:44,883 --> 00:41:47,853
I'm not budging.
He's not budging.
There's--there's
a tremendous difference

00:41:47,853 --> 00:41:49,113
in value here.

00:41:50,153 --> 00:41:52,283
If you guys
would do $75,000

00:41:52,283 --> 00:41:54,053
for 35%, we have
a deal right now.

00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:56,983
You're just looking
at these guys?

00:41:56,983 --> 00:41:58,203
You're not
entertaining this deal?

00:41:58,203 --> 00:41:59,853
I have to see
if they'll take that,

00:41:59,853 --> 00:42:01,183
because that would
equalize the equity.

00:42:01,183 --> 00:42:02,313
But if they--
We'll do $60,000.

00:42:02,313 --> 00:42:03,903
Done at $60,000.
We'll do it right now.

00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,963
Done right now.
$60,000.

00:42:04,963 --> 00:42:06,003
Stop it at $70,000,
and we got a deal.

00:42:11,283 --> 00:42:13,033
We got a deal.
Done!

00:42:13,033 --> 00:42:15,183
I love this guy!

00:42:15,183 --> 00:42:16,183
(Daymond) Thank you.

00:42:16,183 --> 00:42:18,883
I'm sorry, Barbara.

00:42:18,883 --> 00:42:19,933
Thanks, guys.
(Mark) Congrats, Neil.

00:42:19,933 --> 00:42:21,313
Bye.
All right.

00:42:23,233 --> 00:42:25,233
Ooh, I love
a good deal. Mm!

00:42:25,233 --> 00:42:26,883
Yeah, you guys can make
some money with it.

00:42:26,883 --> 00:42:28,953
I love the kid.
Yeah, he's a great kid.

00:42:28,953 --> 00:42:31,003
I was shocked that Kevin
had the perfect connection,

00:42:31,003 --> 00:42:34,283
and bringing Daymond on board
just helped seal the deal.
