00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,202
(man) The sharks are back,

00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:04,470
in an all-new season
of "Shark Tank,"

00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,873
where hopeful entrepreneurs
from across the country

00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:10,276
dream of a chance
to secure an investment

00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:11,477
and gain powerful partners

00:00:11,477 --> 00:00:14,747
to start, grow, or save
their businesses.

00:00:14,747 --> 00:00:17,617
Last year,
we did $1.25 million.

00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:19,419
If the sharks hear
a great idea,

00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:22,889
they're ready to invest
using their own money...

00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:24,557
How is it worth
a million dollars?

00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:27,026
(both, high-pitched voice)
because it's awesome!

00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:30,096
And they'll fight each other
for a piece of the action.

00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:31,431
The problem with Robert's offer is...
there's no problem with Robert's offer.

00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:33,499
You get nothing.
Have you even made an offer?

00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:35,068
I'm trying to,
but you keep interrupting me.

00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:38,738
But first the entrepreneurs
must convince a shark

00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:41,407
to invest the full amount
they're asking for,

00:00:41,407 --> 00:00:42,342
or they'll walk away
with nothing.

00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:43,676
You're going up against
the big boys now

00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:44,744
with our dollars.

00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:46,880
It's sink...

00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,948
you're gonna get crushed,
my friend. Crushed.

00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:51,217
Or swim.
Here's what I'm going
to offer you.

00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,485
What? You're kidding.

00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:54,153
Sorry, can I--
You're screwing up, Rusty.

00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:59,225
Who are the sharks?

00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:02,896
They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors

00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,497
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.

00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:08,668
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist

00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:12,472
who turned a $10,000 loan
into a software business

00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:17,010
worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,811
Lori Greiner,
the queen of qvc,

00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:20,413
holds over a hundred patents

00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,882
and has launched
over 300 products,

00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:24,484
grossing over
a half a billion dollars

00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,619
in retail sales.

00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:29,822
Daymond John is a fashion mogul
and branding expert

00:01:29,822 --> 00:01:31,424
who grew his homemade
clothing line

00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:36,029
into the globally recognized
fashion brand Fubu.

00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:38,965
Robert Herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,

00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:41,034
is now a technology mogul

00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:42,869
who sold his first
internet companies

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,872
for over $350 million.

00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:47,674
And Mark Cuban,

00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,958
First into the tank

00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,492
are Jayson Sandberg
and Taylor Gwiazdon,

00:02:06,492 --> 00:02:08,161
who believe they've made

00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:09,896
a common product
that everybody has

00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,764
even better.

00:02:23,734 --> 00:02:24,801
Hi, my name
is Jayson Sandberg.

00:02:24,801 --> 00:02:26,003
And my name is
Taylor Gwiazdon.

00:02:26,003 --> 00:02:28,472
We are the proud owners
of liddup corporation,

00:02:28,472 --> 00:02:30,874
and we're seeking $100,000

00:02:30,874 --> 00:02:32,409
for a 10% equity stake
in our company.

00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:34,277
We are very excited
to be here

00:02:34,277 --> 00:02:37,547
and to finally introduce
the liddup cooler.

00:02:37,547 --> 00:02:39,016
(imitates drumroll)

00:02:39,016 --> 00:02:41,018
(both) ♪ Ahh ♪

00:02:41,018 --> 00:02:42,886
ahh!
(Lori and Robert laugh)

00:02:42,886 --> 00:02:45,689
The liddup cooler is
the first and only cooler

00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:48,725
with built-in
L.E.D. lighting.

00:02:48,725 --> 00:02:49,126
These bad boys
give you the ability

00:02:49,126 --> 00:02:51,461
to find what
you're looking for.

00:02:51,461 --> 00:02:54,331
It's as simple as that.
This is not rocket science.

00:02:54,331 --> 00:02:56,133
This is exactly how
I came up with the idea.

00:02:56,133 --> 00:02:58,201
I was camping
with my family.

00:02:58,201 --> 00:03:00,203
I was thirsty,
about four hot dogs deep,

00:03:00,203 --> 00:03:02,005
wanting an ice-cold beer.

00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:03,874
I went to
my cold, dark cooler.

00:03:03,874 --> 00:03:06,410
I began sloshing around,
frozen-handed,

00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,145
trying to find
what I was looking for.

00:03:08,145 --> 00:03:12,282
I found a can. I popped
it open... and it was a soda.

00:03:12,282 --> 00:03:14,017
Not what I was looking for.
Oh, no!

00:03:14,017 --> 00:03:16,153
(Kevin) Horrible!
(Lori and Robert laugh)

00:03:16,153 --> 00:03:17,821
I began my search for a cooler
with lights in it,

00:03:17,821 --> 00:03:20,557
and it did not take long
to realize there were none--

00:03:20,557 --> 00:03:22,459
None in existence.

00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:24,327
So I built my own.

00:03:24,327 --> 00:03:26,063
We have working prototypes

00:03:26,063 --> 00:03:27,798
and we're ready
to introduce our technology

00:03:27,798 --> 00:03:31,468
to a world that needs to see
our product.

00:03:31,468 --> 00:03:34,671
So...
who's ready to strike a deal,

00:03:34,671 --> 00:03:36,940
raise a toast,
and get liddup?

00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,409
(both, high-pitched voice)
because it's awesome!

00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:40,744
(laughs)

00:03:40,744 --> 00:03:42,079
So why would we ever
get in business

00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:47,751
with rude and selfish
individuals like you?

00:03:47,751 --> 00:03:50,420
I'm talking about two guys who
just opened a cooler of beer...

00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,688
beer and didn't share
anything with anybody.
And didn't offer it to anybody.

00:03:51,688 --> 00:03:53,423
Oh, shoot!
Yes. Sorry about that.

00:03:53,423 --> 00:03:55,659
(Daymond) How about that?
That is very rude.

00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:57,728
(Lori and Robert laugh)
(Taylor) Who would like one?

00:03:57,728 --> 00:03:59,196
Why, I would.
(Robert) Sure. I'll have one.

00:03:59,196 --> 00:04:01,998
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:04:01,998 --> 00:04:03,934
Oh, yeah, bro. Thanks.

00:04:03,934 --> 00:04:05,068
Salud to the shark tank.

00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:06,803
(clinking)
Cheers, Kevin.

00:04:06,803 --> 00:04:08,538
We already got something
out of the deal.

00:04:08,538 --> 00:04:09,873
Whoo!

00:04:09,873 --> 00:04:11,141
Now, Taylor and Jayson,

00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:13,744
when I heard Daymond
call you greedy,

00:04:13,744 --> 00:04:15,078
I thought
he was talking about

00:04:15,078 --> 00:04:16,546
the valuation
you put on your business.

00:04:16,546 --> 00:04:18,682
Oh, that's next.

00:04:18,682 --> 00:04:21,818
Because you've asked me
for $100,000 for 10%,

00:04:21,818 --> 00:04:24,154
implying that this is worth
a million dollars.

00:04:24,154 --> 00:04:26,690
Defend yourselves
before I drink your beers.

00:04:27,524 --> 00:04:29,392
So we have designed
and developed

00:04:29,392 --> 00:04:31,061
a revolutionary product

00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:34,064
for a very large, $500-Million
gross sales industry.

00:04:34,064 --> 00:04:35,600
We feel that our product's worth
a million dollars

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,468
and we're looking for
a strong strategic partner

00:04:36,468 --> 00:04:38,470
to help us take it to market.

00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,672
But why do you feel
it's worth a million dollars?

00:04:40,672 --> 00:04:41,673
(Daymond)
Those words all just meant

00:04:41,673 --> 00:04:43,742
that
"I don't have any sales."

00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:46,011
Correct?
Correct.

00:04:46,011 --> 00:04:47,212
(Robert) So, Jayson, you never
answered the question.

00:04:47,212 --> 00:04:49,214
How is it worth
a million dollars?

00:04:49,214 --> 00:04:50,815
We had to start somewhere,
so that's where we started at.

00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,950
(sharks laugh)

00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:55,153
Awesome! Awesome!
(Taylor) Yeah.

00:04:55,153 --> 00:04:57,756
You know, most honest--
Not good,

00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,557
but most honest answer ever.

00:04:59,557 --> 00:05:01,226
Well, we appreciate that.
We're honest guys, so...

00:05:01,226 --> 00:05:03,595
(sharks laugh)

00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:06,865
Have you shown it to any buyers
in the large box stores

00:05:06,865 --> 00:05:09,534
that sell all of the coolers?

00:05:09,534 --> 00:05:11,803
Uh, we have not shown it
to any retailers yet,

00:05:11,803 --> 00:05:13,805
uh, and that's on purpose.

00:05:13,805 --> 00:05:15,140
We've been waiting to develop
our intellectual property

00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,409
to help secure our technology
and to protect us.

00:05:17,409 --> 00:05:19,744
What is the intellectual
property in this? Like...
(laughs)

00:05:19,744 --> 00:05:22,881
Do you have a patent
or is one pending?

00:05:22,881 --> 00:05:24,816
We actually have
three issued patents.

00:05:24,816 --> 00:05:27,752
Our patents cover the interior,
uh, L.E.D. Lighting.

00:05:27,752 --> 00:05:32,624
And no one can put an L.E.D.
Anywhere inside a cooler

00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:33,825
except you two dudes?

00:05:33,825 --> 00:05:35,326
Correct.

00:05:36,728 --> 00:05:39,197
I have some potentially bad news
for you.

00:05:39,197 --> 00:05:42,133
I think there's only a couple
of people that make coolers,

00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,469
and they own most of the market.
Am I right?

00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,471
Yes.
Yes, 100% correct.

00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,605
There's three manufacturers,
right?

00:05:47,605 --> 00:05:49,607
(mouths word)

00:05:49,607 --> 00:05:51,476
And therein lies your problem,
because it's a zero-sum game.

00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,479
Either you're gonna get them
to play ball with you

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,814
and light it up with you,

00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:58,483
or it's almost gonna be
impossible to get shelf space

00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,086
unless you spend
an obscene amount of money.

00:06:01,086 --> 00:06:02,954
Have you approached them?

00:06:02,954 --> 00:06:04,289
Uh, that's the reason
why we're here,

00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:05,957
is we have not because--

00:06:05,957 --> 00:06:07,559
Because we were securing
our intellectual property

00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:08,526
and protecting ourselves.

00:06:08,526 --> 00:06:10,862
You agree the right strategy is
not to build your own coolers?

00:06:10,862 --> 00:06:13,131
It's to go to one of
the three guys,

00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:16,601
with a patent that's protected,
and create a license opportunity

00:06:16,601 --> 00:06:19,003
where you get paid--
a few dollars if you're lucky,

00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,472
a few cents if you're not--

00:06:20,472 --> 00:06:23,475
for every single cooler
with lights.

00:06:23,475 --> 00:06:24,809
Wouldn't that be wonderful?
Yes, sir.

00:06:24,809 --> 00:06:26,344
Now that is interesting.

00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,814
But technically,
why do you need us then?

00:06:29,814 --> 00:06:30,815
Because all roads lead to
Mr. Wonderful

00:06:30,815 --> 00:06:32,884
when it comes to
negotiating a license deal.
(both laugh)

00:06:32,884 --> 00:06:34,285
We know that.

00:06:34,285 --> 00:06:35,954
(all laugh)

00:06:35,954 --> 00:06:38,823
Taylor and Jayson,
you're asking $100,000 for 10%--

00:06:38,823 --> 00:06:40,892
It means a million dollars.

00:06:40,892 --> 00:06:42,861
And I, you know,
when I see numbers like that,

00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:43,862
you know what I'm gonna say.

00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:47,265
I know a guy in the Hood
that will follow you around...

00:06:47,265 --> 00:06:48,066
with a flashlight.
With a flashlight

00:06:48,066 --> 00:06:51,736
and show you your beer
for the rest of your life

00:06:51,736 --> 00:06:52,470
for a million dollars.

00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:55,140
(Lori laughs)
I'm out.

00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,541
Okay.

00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,676
Daymond's got
half the Hood employed now.

00:06:58,676 --> 00:07:00,478
(all laugh)

00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:02,147
I think it's interesting.

00:07:02,147 --> 00:07:04,149
I'm not sure how big a need
there is for it.

00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:06,751
Anybody could really buy
a tap light

00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,552
and put it in their cooler.

00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:08,887
Correct.
That's correct.

00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,889
And for that reason,
I'm out.

00:07:15,794 --> 00:07:17,929
(Robert) So, guys,
here's the good news.

00:07:17,929 --> 00:07:21,132
One of my best Friends is one of
the largest makers of tents

00:07:21,132 --> 00:07:22,867
and accessories for them.

00:07:22,867 --> 00:07:25,203
So he knows that market
inside out,

00:07:25,203 --> 00:07:26,404
and we've done
a bunch of deals together.

00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,072
So I can set up a meeting

00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,809
with the largest manufacturer
of coolers in the world

00:07:30,809 --> 00:07:32,811
very easily.

00:07:32,811 --> 00:07:34,145
I'll give you the $100,000...

00:07:34,145 --> 00:07:36,614
for 25% of the company,

00:07:36,614 --> 00:07:38,817
and we'll see what happens
at the meeting.

00:07:38,817 --> 00:07:41,619
I'll tell you what, guys.
I love the beer. Thank you.

00:07:41,619 --> 00:07:44,088
I'm out. Say "Yes" Before
he changes his mind.

00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:47,091
All right, the problem
with Robert's offer is...
there's no problem
with Robert's offer.

00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:50,795
There's only one potential
there--his friend.

00:07:50,795 --> 00:07:53,932
It won't work
unless you have two bids.

00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,600
Because what you want to create

00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,937
is the potential of this market
in their minds.

00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,939
If there are two bidders,
the advance is huge.

00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:03,942
If there's one,
you get nothing.

00:08:05,343 --> 00:08:07,812
This is what uncle Kevin knows,

00:08:07,812 --> 00:08:10,215
and this is where he brings
the big value.

00:08:10,215 --> 00:08:13,084
Only an idiot would
walk into a meeting

00:08:13,084 --> 00:08:14,752
and give the impression

00:08:14,752 --> 00:08:16,154
that there isn't other players
in the market.

00:08:16,154 --> 00:08:19,490
The way you get maximum value

00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,193
is by creating a position
with the first guy

00:08:22,193 --> 00:08:24,929
so that they feel
a certain amount of pressure

00:08:24,929 --> 00:08:27,532
so you don't
walk across the street.

00:08:27,532 --> 00:08:30,802
Robert's wrong because you are
working an oligopoly.

00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:33,671
There are 3 companies
that own over 80% share.
Have you even made an offer?

00:08:33,671 --> 00:08:36,274
I'm trying to,
but you keep interrupting me.

00:08:36,274 --> 00:08:39,210
I'm gonna make it easy. I'm not
gonna ask for any equity at all.

00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,747
I'll give you the $100,000
for one-Third, 33%,

00:08:42,747 --> 00:08:47,552
of whatever we get to license it
from a cooler manufacturer,

00:08:47,552 --> 00:08:48,820
whichever one it is.

00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,155
But I'm there by your side
negotiating it,

00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,290
hockey sticking it,

00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,158
soccer balling it,

00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,794
race driving it
along with you.

00:08:56,794 --> 00:08:59,597
Guys, he's just blowing smoke.

00:08:59,597 --> 00:09:01,266
We're all good at negotiating
up here.

00:09:01,266 --> 00:09:04,669
I like to depend on people
who've been in the business.

00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,605
Kevin negotiates
from a point of aggression.

00:09:07,605 --> 00:09:09,207
I'm happy to walk in
with my friend,

00:09:09,207 --> 00:09:11,743
who's been doing business
with these guys for 20 years.

00:09:11,743 --> 00:09:13,211
And they'll be honest with you

00:09:13,211 --> 00:09:15,146
and tell you whether
there's a deal here or not.

00:09:19,817 --> 00:09:21,152
Can we consult
for just a minute?

00:09:21,152 --> 00:09:23,554
Absolutely.

00:09:23,554 --> 00:09:26,557
Hey, guys, I'll make it
really easy.

00:09:26,557 --> 00:09:29,661
If that offer's attractive
for you, go for it.

00:09:29,661 --> 00:09:30,061
I'm out.

00:09:30,061 --> 00:09:32,263
(Daymond) whoa!

00:09:36,401 --> 00:09:39,203
You got one offer left
on the table.

00:09:43,675 --> 00:09:46,010
Let's do business, Kevin.

00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,078
(claps hands)
(chuckles)

00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:48,680
I'm very excited, gentlemen.

00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,015
I'm gonna drink a beer
in your honor.

00:09:51,015 --> 00:09:52,350
Kevin, you just got lit up
by liddup.

00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,685
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

00:09:53,685 --> 00:09:55,019
It's great.
Let's get started.

00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:57,422
It's very interesting.

00:09:57,422 --> 00:10:00,558
(high-Pitched voice)
what?

00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,859
(Robert)
Hey, I wasn't listening.

00:10:01,859 --> 00:10:03,461
Did you take
their royalties forever

00:10:03,461 --> 00:10:05,196
and their firstborn?

00:10:05,196 --> 00:10:06,864
Uh, left the firstborn out.
(laughs)

00:10:06,864 --> 00:10:08,199
gosh! I can't believe it.

00:10:08,199 --> 00:10:09,600
All this time--
We got a deal with Kevin.

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,935
That's who we wanted
to get a deal with.

00:10:10,935 --> 00:10:12,804
All this time,
all this hard work...

00:10:12,804 --> 00:10:15,340
ohh. It feels great.
It feels absolutely awesome.

00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,809
We can't wait
to light up the world.

who hopes to whet
the sharks' appetites

00:10:29,153 --> 00:10:32,423
with quality meats.

00:10:35,793 --> 00:10:37,929
Hi. I'm Dave Alwan
of Echo Valley meats

00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:41,332
from Peoria, Illinois,
the heart of the midwest.

00:10:41,332 --> 00:10:44,602
I am seeking $300,000

00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:48,006
Echo valley meats makes
the best meat you'll ever eat.

00:10:48,006 --> 00:10:49,340
We specialize

00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,542

00:10:56,347 --> 00:10:58,082
This business is in my blood.

00:10:58,082 --> 00:11:00,618
I'm third generation
in the meat business,

00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,286
a cattleman and a farmer.

00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,088
My motto is simple--

00:11:04,088 --> 00:11:06,290
Know the meat business

00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,060
and I know this business
better than anyone.

00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,263
I'd love for your family,
friends, and clients

00:11:12,263 --> 00:11:15,867
to say "Wow!" When they receive
a gift from ECHO valley meats.

You're the sharks,

00:11:27,545 --> 00:11:29,814
and now it's time
for a feeding frenzy.

00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,949
(Lori and Robert laugh)

00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:34,285
Ladies first.

00:11:34,285 --> 00:11:35,686
(Robert) Oh, wow.
(Lori) Thank you. Wow.

00:11:35,686 --> 00:11:37,155
Robert.

00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,489
Thank you very much.

00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,691
Thank you.
I love cold cuts.

00:11:40,691 --> 00:11:42,593
(Mark) Thank you, sir.

00:11:43,928 --> 00:11:46,464
(Dave) Now I can
assure you...
(Robert) Whoa.

00:11:46,464 --> 00:11:49,267
Whoa.
Making money
never tasted so good.

00:11:49,267 --> 00:11:52,070
Wow. David, can you tell us
what we were eating? What--

00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,739
Sure. Uh, the one
on your plate, Robert,

00:11:54,739 --> 00:11:56,407
to the far--
Your left hand there,

00:11:56,407 --> 00:11:57,675
that would be
a beef tenderloin.

00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,010
That would be--
Very good.

00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,344
Good.
Um, the other one would be

00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,412
our hickory smoked
beef brisket,

00:12:01,412 --> 00:12:04,148
which we slow-roast for
about 15 to 16 hours ourselves.

00:12:04,148 --> 00:12:05,550
That was outstanding.

00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,685
Um, the other one
is our ham,

00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,487
which is a-a-again,
a natural juice ham,

00:12:09,487 --> 00:12:11,355
so there's no water added
to it.

00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,690
And what was this?

00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,158
That is our summer sausage.

00:12:14,158 --> 00:12:15,626
That is an award-winning
summer sausage as well.

00:12:15,626 --> 00:12:15,960
Fantastic.

00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,261
Tell us about
the--the business side of it.

00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:20,665
Uh, last year,
we did $1.25 million...

00:12:20,665 --> 00:12:21,199
(Kevin and Lori) Whoa.

00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:23,201
Between retail, catering,
and our mail order.

00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,403
So when you say retail,
what does that mean?

00:12:25,403 --> 00:12:27,138
I have a retail in Peoria.
You have a retail store?

00:12:27,138 --> 00:12:29,140
Yes, in Peoria.
Oh. Okay.

00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,074
How do customers find you?

00:12:30,074 --> 00:12:33,945
Right now, it's literally,
uh, word of mouth.

00:12:33,945 --> 00:12:36,013
I have been developing this
for the past ten years,

00:12:36,013 --> 00:12:38,216
literally guerilla marketing.

00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:41,085
I get in my car and take samples
to local businesses

00:12:41,085 --> 00:12:42,487
around Peoria--

00:12:42,487 --> 00:12:45,022
$25 gift boxes,
$50 gift boxes--

00:12:45,022 --> 00:12:48,693
and drop 'em off to corporations
and say, "This is what we do."

00:12:48,693 --> 00:12:49,260
Dave, how does
the price point compare

00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,263
to the other competitors,
and the quality?

00:12:52,263 --> 00:12:54,932
42% cheaper than pretty much
anybody in the industry.

00:12:54,932 --> 00:12:58,669
I have stuck to the basics,
believe in the best product.

00:12:58,669 --> 00:13:00,004
I knew it was gonna take me
a lot longer

00:13:00,004 --> 00:13:02,206
to get to where I wanted to go,
but I've stuck to my roots.

00:13:02,206 --> 00:13:04,408
So if you're offering, uh,
the same quality

00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,744
or a better quality Product
for cheaper,

00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,746
what are you margins
on your products?

00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,548
Um,
on the mail-Order business,

00:13:10,548 --> 00:13:12,150
at the end of the day
on any of these items,

00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:15,887
we net about 26% to 28%
across the board.

00:13:15,887 --> 00:13:17,555
This particular ham here,

00:13:17,555 --> 00:13:19,157
which is about an 8- To
10-Pound spiral-Sliced ham,

00:13:19,157 --> 00:13:21,526
would retail in the catalog
for $49.

00:13:21,526 --> 00:13:25,796
That ham cost me between
$16 and $18 before packaging.

00:13:25,796 --> 00:13:27,932
Are you trying to go
into other retail outlets?

00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,400
No, I'd like to go into
more mail order than retail.

00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,802
You wanna go straight direct.
That's right.

00:13:31,802 --> 00:13:33,137
What did you make
on that $1.25 million in Sales?

00:13:33,137 --> 00:13:34,939
Uh, we only netted
about $20,000.

00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,408
Is that after
you paid yourself something?
Yes.

00:13:37,408 --> 00:13:41,479
David, on $1.25 million in
sales, you basically broke even.

00:13:41,479 --> 00:13:42,213
That's what happened.
That's correct.

00:13:42,213 --> 00:13:44,215
So--
(Robert) Why, David?

00:13:44,215 --> 00:13:44,882
I paid for everything
as I went.

00:13:44,882 --> 00:13:48,686
Um, I have--all of my equipment
is paid for in full.

00:13:48,686 --> 00:13:50,354
Um, my smokehouse Alone
would cost

00:13:50,354 --> 00:13:51,489
a quarter-Million dollars
to pay for,

00:13:51,489 --> 00:13:52,890
my sausage Stuffer's $150,000,

00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,625
if you were gonna
buy this stuff brand-new.

00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,993
Everything's paid for
in full.

00:13:55,993 --> 00:13:57,662
But, Dave, if I take out
the one-time cost

00:13:57,662 --> 00:13:58,262
of the equipment...

00:13:58,262 --> 00:14:00,932
Let's say you did
$1.2 million next year

00:14:00,932 --> 00:14:02,733
and got rid
of those one-Time costs.

00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:05,002
How much money
would you have made?

00:14:05,002 --> 00:14:06,604
Um...

00:14:06,604 --> 00:14:09,807
probably closer to $50,000.

00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,742
(Robert) Why is the profit
so low?

00:14:11,742 --> 00:14:13,344
You know, when you're making
that little bit of money,

00:14:13,344 --> 00:14:15,479
one little thing goes wrong,
and...

00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,547
from this point forward,

00:14:16,547 --> 00:14:18,549
once we go over
the $3-Million mark,

00:14:18,549 --> 00:14:19,951
everything becomes profit.

00:14:19,951 --> 00:14:21,085
Our overhead doesn't change
one bit. Um...

00:14:21,085 --> 00:14:23,354
so you have a cost structure

00:14:23,354 --> 00:14:26,490
that you've gotta do a certain
amount just to break even.

00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,859
That's right. 1.2
is basically our break-Even,

00:14:28,859 --> 00:14:30,528
and that's where we're at
right now.

00:14:30,528 --> 00:14:33,731
So I give you the $300,000.
What do you spend it on?

00:14:33,731 --> 00:14:35,666
Um, I would think
purely marketing

00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,802
and bringing in product
inventory before the season.

00:14:37,802 --> 00:14:39,737
But what type of marketing?
There's...
uh, national e-commerce.

00:14:39,737 --> 00:14:40,938
I think that's where the growth
is, really, is e-commerce.

00:14:40,938 --> 00:14:42,607
The problem with that,
David, is,

00:14:42,607 --> 00:14:45,209
do you know what it cost you
to acquire a new customer?

00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:46,410
Um, not really,
to be honest with you.

00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,013
We've been developing this,
recreating the Web site,

00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,082
just really fine-Tuning
last multiple years

00:14:51,082 --> 00:14:52,683
to get to where we're at now.

00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,685
But you wanna take my $300,000
to experiment

00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,420
to find those answers.

00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,556
I don't know what
it's gonna cost

00:14:58,556 --> 00:15:01,859
to get a customer that comes
back every holiday to buy a ham.

00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,594
You don't, either.

00:15:03,594 --> 00:15:03,928
You're gonna go find out.

00:15:03,928 --> 00:15:06,797
You're gonna spend
my $300,000 doing it.

00:15:06,797 --> 00:15:08,599
Maybe you'll be successful,
maybe you won't be

00:15:08,599 --> 00:15:10,401
because--
I know a--I know a customer
that ordered $1,400

00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:12,737
only ordered $900 last year.

00:15:12,737 --> 00:15:14,472
So I-I feel
in the past several years

00:15:14,472 --> 00:15:16,340
I have not lost any business.

00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,743
Each customer has came back
and continued to grow with us.

00:15:18,743 --> 00:15:20,811
Dave, I don't--I don't think
that there's any doubt

00:15:20,811 --> 00:15:22,480
This is a fantastic product.
The meat was great.

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,148
But here is my challenge--

00:15:24,148 --> 00:15:26,817
I didn't know about you
until you walked out here,

00:15:26,817 --> 00:15:29,687
I buy stuff like this
all the time...

00:15:29,687 --> 00:15:31,889
Sure.
As corporate gifts
for our corporate customers.

00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,692
But Kevin's right.

00:15:34,692 --> 00:15:37,395
It's very, very expensive
to find those people.

00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:39,597
These people mail me,
they e-mail me,

00:15:39,597 --> 00:15:41,999
they blast me
all kinds of stuff.

00:15:41,999 --> 00:15:45,069
And I'm--I'm struggling
with the $300,000.

00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,204
Like, I-I know that's
a lot of money.

00:15:47,204 --> 00:15:49,206
But I don't know. I think
it's gonna cost a lot more.

00:15:49,206 --> 00:15:50,541
(Daymond) Yeah, I mean, my--
My challenge is the same thing.

00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:51,008
You're going up against
the big boys now

00:15:51,008 --> 00:15:52,610
with our dollars.

00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:56,347
One point that you said to me
that would help you

00:15:56,347 --> 00:15:58,949
that was attractive was
yours is a $49 ham.

00:15:58,949 --> 00:16:02,753
And I think the other hams
out there are like $69, $79.

00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:03,888
And that's
at a smaller weight also.

00:16:03,888 --> 00:16:04,955
So they're
significantly higher...
uh-huh.

00:16:04,955 --> 00:16:06,691
With not as much product also.

00:16:06,691 --> 00:16:08,359
I think that's
a real distinct advantage,

00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:09,193
'cause the other stuff--
You're right, Lori--

00:16:09,193 --> 00:16:11,128
Is way more money.
(Kevin) I don't know if it's--

00:16:11,128 --> 00:16:12,797
It's actually--Yeah,
it's not an advantage at all

00:16:12,797 --> 00:16:13,798
because you're not making money.

00:16:13,798 --> 00:16:15,800
They're--they're selling
their product at a higher price

00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,668
because, obviously,
they have to.
(Lori) They're making more.
Yeah.

00:16:17,668 --> 00:16:20,404
But again, I've only targeted
60 miles around Peoria.

00:16:20,404 --> 00:16:22,807
(Kevin) No, but I think
what we'll find out, Dave,

00:16:22,807 --> 00:16:24,809
is the reason
they're $79 on your $49 ham

00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:28,412
is that their cost of customer
acquisition is the difference.

00:16:28,412 --> 00:16:30,681
And you'd find that out. You're
not gonna be any different.

00:16:30,681 --> 00:16:32,483
It's gonna cost money,
maybe $20 more per order.

00:16:32,483 --> 00:16:35,019
If we would get to
a $5-Million point

00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:37,688
on our mail-Order business
alone and net 28%,

00:16:37,688 --> 00:16:41,158
for $300,000, you would have
100% return on Investment back

00:16:41,158 --> 00:16:42,059
within basically--
Yeah, but that's--That's--

00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:44,528
(Robert) Yeah, but you're not--
You're not telling us--

00:16:44,528 --> 00:16:45,863
That--That's a long road
from here to there.

00:16:45,863 --> 00:16:47,732
Dave, here's where you
screwed up, all right?

00:16:47,732 --> 00:16:50,468
You know the meat business.
You make a great product.

00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:54,805
You proved it.
But what you've told us is,

00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,274
your retail business
is your retail business.

00:16:57,274 --> 00:17:00,478
You see the upside,
because the margins are greater,

00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,079
in the direct mail business,
particularly through e-commerce.

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,881
The one thing you didn't do

00:17:03,881 --> 00:17:06,550
was come prepared
to explain to us why.

00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:09,086
You're coming in unprepared.

00:17:09,086 --> 00:17:11,088
That doesn't cut it.
I'm out.

00:17:11,088 --> 00:17:13,624
Okay.

00:17:15,793 --> 00:17:17,461
(Robert)
You're making the assumption

00:17:17,461 --> 00:17:19,930
people are gonna buy
your product and stay with you,

00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,866
but you're not answering
the question--

00:17:21,866 --> 00:17:24,935
How much it's gonna cost
to find that customer.

00:17:24,935 --> 00:17:26,871
Yeah.
I think you came up
with $300,000.

00:17:26,871 --> 00:17:30,341
I asked you, how are you gonna
specifically spend that,

00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:32,276
and you say marketing,
national marketing.

00:17:32,276 --> 00:17:34,612
And maybe it's sending out
samples like I did, you know,

00:17:34,612 --> 00:17:35,212
in my car--
Oh, whoa, Dave.

00:17:35,212 --> 00:17:36,947
You never wanna talk
about "Maybe."
Yeah.

00:17:36,947 --> 00:17:38,949
You know,
I-I grew up on a farm.

00:17:38,949 --> 00:17:40,351
Right, you know, a farmer
doesn't go out in the field

00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,685
and throw a bunch of seeds out
and says,

00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,220
"Gee, I hope there's corn
next year."

00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,688
(chuckles)
Yeah. True.

00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,357
That's what you're doing.
True.

00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:47,825
I'm sorry. I'm out.

00:17:47,825 --> 00:17:50,060
Okay.

00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,061
But I will take more sausage.

00:17:51,061 --> 00:17:53,864
(Lori and Robert laugh)
there's plenty of that.

00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:57,067
Can't call
your business plan bad

00:17:57,067 --> 00:17:58,736
because there isn't one.

00:17:58,736 --> 00:18:01,272
It's kind of an interesting
problem you have here, Dave.

00:18:01,272 --> 00:18:03,274
The product is
absolutely spectacular.

00:18:03,274 --> 00:18:04,074
Thank you.

00:18:04,074 --> 00:18:09,413
And the strategy to get it
into the market isn't there,

00:18:09,413 --> 00:18:12,550
at least,
in terms of e-commerce.

00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,551
I don't see the opportunity

00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:14,885
'cause you didn't present it
to me. I'm out.

00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:17,354
Okay.

00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,091
Daymond or Lori?

00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:22,860
You probably can't tell it,

00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,730
but I-I generally try not
to eat red meat. I eat fish.

00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,200
Um, I'm trying not to go
in that area of business.

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,470
Um, you know, my kids are vegans
and things of that nature.

00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,539
So from just
that standpoint alone,

00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:35,940
I'm out.

00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,546
And, Lori?

00:18:42,546 --> 00:18:44,415
I really like you...

00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:45,749
thank you.

00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:46,951
And I think the product
is amazing.

00:18:46,951 --> 00:18:50,488
I have a lot of experience
with catalog sales.

00:18:50,488 --> 00:18:53,357
And it is hard
to get your name known,

00:18:53,357 --> 00:18:54,992
and you do have
a lot of competition.

00:18:54,992 --> 00:18:57,061
I think that you'll make it,
slowly.

00:18:57,061 --> 00:19:01,265
But I like to get things
out there really quickly

00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,267
to get my return
on my investment,

00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,337
and I don't see that
happening here.

00:19:06,337 --> 00:19:08,739
And for that reason,
I'm out.

00:19:08,739 --> 00:19:10,474
Okay.

00:19:10,474 --> 00:19:11,542
Good luck, David.

00:19:11,542 --> 00:19:13,477

If he wasn't
as nice as he was...

He came out here with no plan.

(Daymond and Lori laugh)

people with that same thing,

But the guy was
just a nice guy.
Yeah, and he gave us--

00:19:26,557 --> 00:19:28,692
And he fed you.
He gave us
a good piece of steak.

00:22:10,363 --> 00:22:11,964
Tell us about sales.
Are you making any money?

00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:13,299
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:15,034
Okay, so last year,
what did you sell?

00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:18,404
Last year we sold
a little under 10,000.

00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:19,739
Dollars?
No, units.

00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:21,073
Units.
How many dollars is that?

00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:22,208
So that's, uh,
$525,000.

00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,876
What?

00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:24,677
(Kevin) Ooh.

00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,212
Make it any money on that?

00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:28,014
Yeah, yeah, last year was
$140,000 in profit.

00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:29,081
Wow.

00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,216
Wow.

00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:31,551
Tell us about
your sales model.

00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:32,885
How do you sell it?
Where do you sell it?

00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:34,220
What are your markets?
It's all e-Commerce.

00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,621
Seems like
the natural place for it.

00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:36,556
No retailers?
No retailers.

00:22:36,556 --> 00:22:37,957
That's a big part of
the reason why I'm here.

00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:39,959
(Robert) are you
the only guy?

00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:41,294
'cause I'm pretty sure my son,
who's 18,

00:22:41,294 --> 00:22:43,296
all his buddies wear
suits like this,

00:22:43,296 --> 00:22:46,499
and they go to nightclubs
and parties.
A-absolutely. Absolutely.

00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:47,967
So you--You have
seen it before?

00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:50,169
That's my question.
Would I have seen yours

00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:52,271
or is there a bunch of people
making these?
So were the first.

00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:54,273
We started in 2008.
We totally originated--

00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:55,675
Opened up This product space.

00:22:55,675 --> 00:22:58,411
We had quick
and profound success,

00:22:58,411 --> 00:23:00,079
and of course some people
have come in--

00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,681
So you have competition?
We have competition,
absolutely.

00:23:01,681 --> 00:23:04,483
So you're the--
You're the main brand.

00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:04,817
We are the--
You were the first guy.

00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:06,419
We were the first guys.

00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:08,421
Is there any brand recognition
on the suit itself?

00:23:08,421 --> 00:23:09,889
Does it say "rootsuit"
on it anywhere,

00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:12,558
like on the foot
or anything like that?

00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:13,826
Just so somebody can say, "Hey,
look. This is where I got it"?

00:23:16,162 --> 00:23:17,496
That's probably a good idea.

00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:19,231
This is one thing
that I'd actually like

00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,434
to investigate a little more.

00:23:21,434 --> 00:23:22,768
(Robert) This is super hot
right now.

00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,203
You go snowboarding,

00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:24,870
the kids are wearing this
on the ski hills.

00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,940
It's super, super--
Oh, there you go--Super hot.

00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:31,277
But here's the problem--
Maybe you created the market,

00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:34,080
but there's no way to know
This is your product.

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,549
I think it's a--It's a big
challenge ahead of you.

00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:37,617
I'm out.

00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:39,285
Oh. I'm sorry
to hear that.

00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:40,486
I do have--I have a--
I have a--

00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:41,487
Definitely an answer
for that.

00:23:41,487 --> 00:23:42,822
Um--
Go ahead. You got
four other sharks.

00:23:42,822 --> 00:23:44,423
Well, Colin...
okay. Okay.

00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,424
I'll--I'll tell you, too.

00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,693
I think they're very cool.
I really like them.

00:23:47,693 --> 00:23:50,563
But I do think you have
a competition problem.

00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:52,231
I-I can't see you
protecting this in any way

00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:55,368
and I can see a lot of other
people making it.

00:23:55,368 --> 00:23:57,737
And so for that reason,
I'm out.

00:23:57,737 --> 00:23:59,872
Let me speak to that...
(laughs) Before--Before--

00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:00,873
Before you all think that
that's a huge problem.

00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:03,075
I mean, lots--Lots of
businesses have competition.

00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:05,878
And the way that they do it--
I'm talking to you now--

00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:07,213
Um, is through branding...

00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:08,280
Yeah.
You know? I mean,

00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,949
how many people came in after
you started what you started

00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:12,618
and make--Make
very similar things,

00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:13,285
but people kept buying yours

00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,354
because you were able
to brand it.
Correct.

00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:16,288
(Kevin)
I like to put money into things

00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,957
that get really big
so I get much richer.

00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,759
Yeah.
That's sort of my strategy.

00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:21,761
I-I don't know how this is

00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:24,964
going to turn into
a $50-Million

00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,699
squeeze-a-guy-in-a-suit
business.

00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:29,568
For me as an investment,
it ain't there. I'm out.

00:24:31,604 --> 00:24:33,606
You are making money.

00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:35,608
We're making
a lot of money.

00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:37,610
But the only way that it's
of value to me is

00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:40,212
to own a good portion
of the company, number one.

00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:42,415
Number two, we know
it can go to retail.

00:24:42,415 --> 00:24:43,749
I'm gonna have to give you
an offer

00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:45,217
that's gonna be
a very sharky offer.

00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:49,021
I'll give you, uh,
the $100,000 for 50%.

00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:50,756
(chuckles)

00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:53,492
okay. I-I really appreciate
the offer.

00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:53,826
That--I'm doing numbers
in my head.

00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:55,828
Is there a contingency
on that?

00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:56,696
Contingency is that
we have to get it into retail.

00:24:56,696 --> 00:24:59,365
Get it into retail.
I love--

00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:00,700
(Robert) wow.
'cause then I know my work
starts at that point.

00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,168
Well, you got an offer.

00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:02,935
I love--Let me say,
I love that contingency

00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:04,937
and I would--
there's no one in the world

00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:06,672
I would rather do that with
than you. (chuckles)

00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,808
Um...

00:25:08,808 --> 00:25:10,876
that's great. Um...

00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:12,344
You may want to hear
from Mr. Cuban first.

00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,813
He's been known to do
really crazy things.

00:25:13,813 --> 00:25:14,747
I want to hear what you say
to his offer first.

00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:18,484
Okay. Well, I'm... sorry.

00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:19,952
Can I...
I got really excited.

00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:22,221
I'd like to take a second
to think about this.
(mark laughs)

00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:23,956
You don't seem really excited.
Yeah, he does.

00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:26,092
Yeah, he does.
He's like... (flat voice)
"Yeah, ah, that's great."

00:25:26,092 --> 00:25:27,093
(Robert) So, Colin,
it's an interesting position.

00:25:27,093 --> 00:25:29,095
Three sharks are out.

00:25:29,095 --> 00:25:30,096
One has made an offer.

00:25:30,096 --> 00:25:32,164
Which is--
The last one is saying

00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:34,033
"I'm not telling you
want I'm gonna do

00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:35,835
until you tell me what
the other guy's doing."

00:25:35,835 --> 00:25:37,203
I think...
what do you do?

00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:38,204
That what I--the people
I would love

00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:40,139
to work with the most
would be you two.

00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:41,741
I think you should throw in
$100,000, too.

00:25:41,741 --> 00:25:43,142
(Daymond) but I'm not gonna work
with him.

00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:44,677
(laughs) And own 100%
of the company?

00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:47,480
No, no, no. Let's keep it--
Let's keep it at 50%.
(sharks laugh)

00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,948
I-I'm--I'm not
gonna work with mark.
I really--

00:25:48,948 --> 00:25:50,683
Okay.

00:25:50,683 --> 00:25:52,151
You should
maybe entertain mark,

00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:53,152
because I'm on the fence.

00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,955
I may actually
take that offer back.

00:25:55,955 --> 00:25:57,089
(Kevin) Often this happens.

00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:58,758
A dog has a bone in its jaws.
It gets to a bridge.

(speaks indistinctly)

00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:02,695
It looks down. It sees
the reflection of another bone.

00:26:02,695 --> 00:26:04,230
Opens its mouth
to get that one,

00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,232
and "Oh, no.
The first bone's gone!"
(mark laughs)

00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:08,567
I mean, there is--
There is--

00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:08,901
I think you've got a bone
in your mouth right now...
okay.

00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,402
And you don't want
to get boned,

00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,271
so you better think
a little bit about this.

00:28:03,816 --> 00:28:06,619
we watched Lucinda Lent
and Juliet Boydstun

00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:08,554
make a deal
with Barbara Corcoran

00:28:08,554 --> 00:28:10,823
for their children's party spot
the coop.

00:28:10,823 --> 00:28:13,559
We are thrilled to be
in business with you, Barbara.

00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,361
Let's see
what they're up to now.

00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:16,695
(Juliet) Business is booming

00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,163
since we've been on
"Shark tank."

00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:19,231
It's amazing.
We're so excited.

00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:21,233
I'm sorry. We're all sold out
that weekend.

00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:24,670
Last year our sales
were around $350,000.

00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:28,007
This year, we're on track
to be at a million dollars.

00:28:28,007 --> 00:28:28,674
(Lucinda, australian accent)
We have been inundated

00:28:28,674 --> 00:28:30,943
with franchise requests.

00:28:30,943 --> 00:28:32,945
We're in talks right now
to open a location in miami

00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:33,946
and one in Washington, D.C.

00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:37,549
And we have plans to expand
in Los Angeles next year.

00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,351
(both) Hi, Barbara.

00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:41,887
I've been expecting your call.
Nice to see both of you.

00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:44,423
Barbara has been amazing.

00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:46,692
I never doubted for a minute
that you would succeed.

00:28:46,692 --> 00:28:48,360
But I was so worried
that your business

00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,362
would be confined
by those walls.

00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:52,364
With Barbara's help,
we figured out a way

00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:56,435
to expand and get our parties
outside of the coop.

Hi, sharks.

00:29:50,346 --> 00:29:52,348
My name is Rusty Allen.

00:29:52,348 --> 00:29:54,350
I'm an industrial design
entrepreneur

00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,685
and the founder
of gobieh2o.

00:29:55,685 --> 00:29:58,821
I'm asking for
a $300,000 investment

00:29:58,821 --> 00:30:02,692
for 10% of my company.

00:30:02,692 --> 00:30:04,927
Four years ago,
when the recession hit

00:30:04,927 --> 00:30:06,662
I realized I was spending
more money

00:30:06,662 --> 00:30:09,599
on single-use water bottles
per gallon

00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:13,936
than I was on the gas that
I was putting into my car.

00:30:13,936 --> 00:30:15,538
(thuds)
And that pissed me off.

00:30:15,538 --> 00:30:18,074
And that's when I decided
to develop gobie.

00:30:18,074 --> 00:30:20,076
Gobie is the world's

00:30:20,076 --> 00:30:22,411
most advanced filtered
water bottle on the market.

00:30:22,411 --> 00:30:24,013
Our flex flow technology

00:30:24,013 --> 00:30:26,616
allows you to have
the durability of a hard-shell

00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:29,485
with the accessibility
of a soft-shell.

00:30:29,485 --> 00:30:31,087
What that allows you to do

00:30:31,087 --> 00:30:33,289
is have clean,
purified water instantly.

00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:36,359
One thing that I realized
after developing this product

00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:39,328
was we could filter out
way more than just tap water,

00:30:39,328 --> 00:30:41,464
and I'd love to show you
what I mean by that.

00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:42,999
With our upgraded filter,

00:30:42,999 --> 00:30:44,800
we have the ability
to filter out

00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:49,071
99.99% of all contaminants
found in water.

00:30:49,071 --> 00:30:50,139
For the purpose
of this demo,

00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:53,476
I'm just gonna take ordinary
dirt and throw it in there.

00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:54,877
This is
really fine potting soil.

00:30:54,877 --> 00:30:56,879
Shake it up.

00:30:56,879 --> 00:31:00,216
This is disgusting,
dirty, dirty water

00:31:00,216 --> 00:31:02,084
that no one
would ever want to drink.

00:31:02,084 --> 00:31:04,287
Now with this upgraded filter,

00:31:04,287 --> 00:31:07,023
it allows the ability
to filter out clean,

00:31:07,023 --> 00:31:09,225
purified water instantly,

00:31:09,225 --> 00:31:12,261
anywhere you go.

00:31:12,261 --> 00:31:13,596
Mm.

00:31:13,596 --> 00:31:16,332
Oh.

00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:18,734
So I would love to
show you guys this product

00:31:18,734 --> 00:31:20,536
in person.

00:31:20,536 --> 00:31:23,339
Ladies first.

00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:23,673
Thank you.

00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,875
You bet.

00:31:25,875 --> 00:31:27,209
There you go.
Thanks, Rusty.

00:31:27,209 --> 00:31:27,743
You bet.
Here you go.

00:31:27,743 --> 00:31:29,612
Thank you, Rusty.

00:31:29,612 --> 00:31:32,148
Which one of you sharks

00:31:32,148 --> 00:31:36,018
wants to invest in clean,
purified gobie success?

00:31:38,287 --> 00:31:40,823
Are you looking to sell this,
Rusty,

00:31:40,823 --> 00:31:43,092
as a mainstream product
in America

00:31:43,092 --> 00:31:45,795
to compete with all the other
water containers

00:31:45,795 --> 00:31:47,463
or are you trying to go
into the specialty niche

00:31:47,463 --> 00:31:49,131
of providing purified water
in countries

00:31:49,131 --> 00:31:49,799
where it's not available?

00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:53,202
Right now, the special filter
is a prototype.

00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:54,937
And that's a great thing,
and that was--

00:31:54,937 --> 00:31:56,339
That shows the power
of our technology.

00:31:56,339 --> 00:31:59,008
But my main Focus right now

00:31:59,008 --> 00:32:02,278
is to compete with single-Use
water bottles here in America.

00:32:02,278 --> 00:32:04,280
But don't you think,
here in America,

00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,282
people are pretty comfortable
filling up

00:32:06,282 --> 00:32:07,817
their existing bottles today
with water out of the tap?

00:32:07,817 --> 00:32:11,020
They don't need
the extra cost of a filter.

00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,756
Kevin's right, shockingly.

00:32:13,756 --> 00:32:16,025
Not only are we accepting
tap water

00:32:16,025 --> 00:32:18,027
or other forms of water
outside of the bottle,

00:32:18,027 --> 00:32:20,329
but there's also other filters
that filter good enough.

00:32:20,329 --> 00:32:21,664
(Robert) Yeah, Rusty.

00:32:21,664 --> 00:32:23,666
I mean, my kids have
a water bottle,

00:32:23,666 --> 00:32:25,668
and it has a filter
on the inside of it.

00:32:25,668 --> 00:32:29,472
And they've had that
for, my gosh, three years.

00:32:29,472 --> 00:32:31,140
But probably not the same
kind of filter this is.

00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,942
No, it is.

00:32:32,942 --> 00:32:35,277
The only difference I see
in yours

00:32:35,277 --> 00:32:38,214
is that you have this soft,
compressible area

00:32:38,214 --> 00:32:41,150
and a Harder shell--
The two combined together.

00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,218
I haven't seen that, but...

00:32:42,218 --> 00:32:43,552
okay.

00:32:43,552 --> 00:32:45,221
I have seen
multiple products

00:32:45,221 --> 00:32:47,223
where there is a filter
just like yours

00:32:47,223 --> 00:32:49,225
that takes out 99.9%
of the contaminants...
okay.

00:32:49,225 --> 00:32:53,396
That you can either put into
different water bottles...

00:32:53,396 --> 00:32:55,531
Yeah.
Or that already come
built inside.

00:32:57,333 --> 00:32:58,334
Right, well, I'll--
I'll show you--

00:32:58,334 --> 00:33:00,336
the--I'll show you
the beauty of that technology--

00:33:00,336 --> 00:33:01,003
Flex flow technology.

00:33:01,003 --> 00:33:04,407
What it allows us to do...

00:33:06,142 --> 00:33:07,143
And most--Most squeeze bottles,

00:33:07,143 --> 00:33:09,145
they won't last the life
of the filter

00:33:09,145 --> 00:33:10,880
because they're not
very durable,

00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,214
they scratch up.

00:33:12,214 --> 00:33:13,215
They end up not holding
a Seal really Well

00:33:13,215 --> 00:33:14,550
because it's
soft materials, right?

00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:17,286
Well,
the hard-Shell bottles

00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:18,621
are really good,

00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:19,955
but if you have a filter
in it,

00:33:19,955 --> 00:33:21,023
you have to suck
the water through.

00:33:21,023 --> 00:33:23,359
Which really limits what kind
of filter you can put in there.

00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:24,994
So the ability to have
a hard-shell

00:33:24,994 --> 00:33:28,264
combined with a soft-Shell
is the best of both worlds.

00:33:28,264 --> 00:33:29,131
(Robert)
No, but, Rusty, hang on.

00:33:29,131 --> 00:33:30,466
You're saying
all the other products,

00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:32,134
which do the same thing,

00:33:32,134 --> 00:33:34,336
can't filter to a level
that you can?

00:33:34,336 --> 00:33:36,605
Yours is so good
that you can filter dirt.

00:33:36,605 --> 00:33:37,606
Nobody else can do that?

00:33:37,606 --> 00:33:40,409
In the way that we do.

00:33:41,877 --> 00:33:44,213
That's a different answer
to a different question.

00:33:44,213 --> 00:33:45,214
Well, there--There are--
Okay.

00:33:45,214 --> 00:33:47,817
We've tested our filter
in other water bottles,

00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:50,086
and we've realized
that this technology--

00:33:50,086 --> 00:33:52,488
The flex flow technology--

00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:54,490
Builds up a ton
of pressure in here

00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:59,128
and allows you to filter out
more than everybody else can.

00:33:59,128 --> 00:34:00,596
(Daymond) I never thought
I would say it,

00:34:00,596 --> 00:34:02,264
but this is an extremely sexy
water bottle,

00:34:02,264 --> 00:34:03,799
you know,
to tell you the truth.

00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:06,202
All right.
Thank you. I appreciate it.

00:34:06,202 --> 00:34:08,537
How much
does this cost retail?

00:34:08,537 --> 00:34:09,605
Retail is $30.

00:34:09,605 --> 00:34:11,607
How much
are you making them for?

00:34:11,607 --> 00:34:13,409
We're making them for $10
in the U.S. Right now.

00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:15,211
We're made in san Diego.

00:34:15,211 --> 00:34:17,813
That includes the first filter,
which is for tap water.

00:34:17,813 --> 00:34:19,949
That filter lasts 3 months
or 100 gallons.

00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:22,751
The consumer buys it
every quarter. Very simple.

00:34:22,751 --> 00:34:24,019
Oh, so you have to keep on
re-Buying the filter?

00:34:24,019 --> 00:34:25,754
Yeah. Yeah, that's repeat...

00:34:25,754 --> 00:34:26,956
okay, let me ask
one more question.
Filter sales.

00:34:26,956 --> 00:34:28,958
Did you license the filter

00:34:28,958 --> 00:34:31,093
or is this 100% your design?

00:34:31,093 --> 00:34:33,462
You did all the work
as an industrial engineer?

00:34:35,397 --> 00:34:38,000
As far as the technology of it,
it's a carbon block.

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,803
It's--It's--It's free market,
uh, technology.

00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:45,341
What were your sales?

00:34:45,341 --> 00:34:48,477
Our sales to date,
only online,

00:34:48,477 --> 00:34:50,946
have been 10,000 bottles
and 15,000 filters.

00:34:50,946 --> 00:34:52,948
What's your total sales?
Revenue, what is that?

00:34:52,948 --> 00:34:56,152
Total s--
Revenue is $285,000.

00:34:56,152 --> 00:34:57,286
Over what period of time?

00:34:57,286 --> 00:34:59,688
17 months.

00:34:59,688 --> 00:35:01,423
Okay.

00:35:01,423 --> 00:35:02,424
Just so you guys know,
as far as sales,

00:35:02,424 --> 00:35:04,426
I've only been selling
the blue bottle.

00:35:04,426 --> 00:35:06,529
We went to retail--

00:35:06,529 --> 00:35:08,264
Who did you go to?

00:35:08,264 --> 00:35:10,799
Bed Bath &amp; Beyond,
Target, and jcpennys.

00:35:10,799 --> 00:35:12,067
What happened?

00:35:12,067 --> 00:35:13,869
So they came back
and they said,

00:35:13,869 --> 00:35:15,871
"in order to get this in there,
we need more colors."

00:35:15,871 --> 00:35:16,872
Wait. I have to stop you
for a minute,

00:35:16,872 --> 00:35:19,408
because that doesn't
make sense to me.

00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:22,011
If they thought that this was
so original and so unique

00:35:22,011 --> 00:35:23,746
and something
that they really wanted,

00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:25,748
they would've grabbed it,
they would've tested it.

00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:28,484
So my feeling is

00:35:28,484 --> 00:35:31,353
you didn't get into them
because there are already

00:35:31,353 --> 00:35:32,888
so many others
out there like it,

00:35:32,888 --> 00:35:36,158
and they probably have
a less-Expensive version.

00:35:36,158 --> 00:35:37,760
I like that you are creative

00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,861
and that you're trying
to do something

00:35:38,861 --> 00:35:40,863
and be an entrepreneur.

00:35:40,863 --> 00:35:42,665
But I think there's tons
of competition out there,

00:35:42,665 --> 00:35:46,602
and for that reason, I'm out.

00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,204
Okay. That's fine.

00:35:48,204 --> 00:35:49,205
I have a different issue
with you, Rusty,

00:35:49,205 --> 00:35:51,473
which we haven't
addressed yet.

00:35:51,473 --> 00:35:54,543
Explain to me why
you're worth $3 million today

00:35:54,543 --> 00:35:58,214
and how it's gonna be
worth more tomorrow.

00:35:58,214 --> 00:36:00,216
Because unless we get
past that, Rusty,

00:36:00,216 --> 00:36:02,218
I don't care what colors
the bottles are,

00:36:02,218 --> 00:36:04,286
you're not getting
any of my money.

00:36:04,286 --> 00:36:05,621
Well, first of all,

00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:07,823
you guys know
every human being on the earth--

00:36:07,823 --> 00:36:11,493
the richest man in Beverly hills
and the poorest man in Kenya--

00:36:11,493 --> 00:36:12,061
Both drink water.

00:36:12,061 --> 00:36:14,863
And besides--Besides
breathing oxygen--

00:36:14,863 --> 00:36:16,665
That's just a horrible
sales pitch, Rusty.

00:36:16,665 --> 00:36:18,667
Come on.
Listen, I'm just saying
how broad it is.

00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:20,402
Let me get back to my--

00:36:20,402 --> 00:36:21,003
It's an obvious broad market.

00:36:21,003 --> 00:36:23,405
(Kevin) Okay, Rusty,
here's the bottom line--

00:36:23,405 --> 00:36:24,740
What you should've said is

00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:27,810
that you were gonna sell
$3-Million worth

00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:30,279
of these bottles
in the next 12 months,

00:36:30,279 --> 00:36:33,482
make $500,000 or $600,000
in profit.

00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:34,149
I would've had
a debate with you.

00:36:34,149 --> 00:36:35,551
We would've stayed engaged.
You never did that.

00:36:36,952 --> 00:36:38,020
I'm out.

00:36:39,555 --> 00:36:43,759
Rusty, Rusty, let me clarify
your problem for you, okay?

00:36:43,759 --> 00:36:46,862
You've got
really cool-looking bottles.

00:36:46,862 --> 00:36:49,932
But you're trying to be in
the water filtration business.

00:36:49,932 --> 00:36:52,334
The part
that differentiates you,

00:36:52,334 --> 00:36:54,003
that makes it
a really cool product,

00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:56,939
you're not focusing on
at all.

00:36:56,939 --> 00:36:59,275
If you just walked in
and said,

00:36:59,275 --> 00:37:01,543
"you know what? We have
the coolest, hippest,

00:37:01,543 --> 00:37:03,612
"best-looking bottles
on the planet.

00:37:03,612 --> 00:37:05,347
"and by the way,

00:37:05,347 --> 00:37:09,351
"if you have a user who has
a need for daily filtration,

00:37:09,351 --> 00:37:11,020
we have a solution."

00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,354
You're screwing up, Rusty.

00:37:12,354 --> 00:37:14,156
I see what you're saying.

00:37:14,156 --> 00:37:16,358
I was getting caught up
in all the other details.

00:37:16,358 --> 00:37:18,360
But the end of the day,
we're able to filter out

00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,863
more prod--
More, uh, contaminants

00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:22,531
than anyone else
because of this.

00:37:25,734 --> 00:37:28,404
Rusty, look, I'm--
I'm gonna make it simple.

00:37:28,404 --> 00:37:30,339
I'm out, right?
You're selling the wrong thing.

00:37:33,142 --> 00:37:36,345
Rusty, you seem like a nice guy,
but that was just

00:37:36,345 --> 00:37:38,080
a really convoluted
presentation, my friend.

00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,749
I mean, that was just
so bad.

00:37:40,749 --> 00:37:45,287
I don't think you understand,
uh, the business that you're in.

00:37:47,089 --> 00:37:49,358
You're gonna get crushed,
my friend.

00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:50,793
Crushed.

00:37:50,793 --> 00:37:51,794
I'm out.

00:37:56,532 --> 00:37:59,201
I'm sitting here quietly
rooting for you,

00:37:59,201 --> 00:38:01,937
but every one
of the other sharks

00:38:01,937 --> 00:38:05,007
are bringing up
really, really valuable points.

00:38:05,007 --> 00:38:07,276
What do you want
the money for?

00:38:07,276 --> 00:38:08,944
We need the money
for inventory

00:38:08,944 --> 00:38:10,145
and a little bit
of operating cost.

00:38:10,145 --> 00:38:13,415
Like I said,
I'm working 24/7,

00:38:13,415 --> 00:38:14,083
seven days a week.

00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,018
Uh, Rusty, just because--
No, listen.

00:38:16,018 --> 00:38:18,354
Rusty, just because
you work hard...
can I finish really quick?

00:38:18,354 --> 00:38:19,755
Doesn't mean
you're gonna be successful.
I--No, listen.

00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:21,156
I-I want to hear this.
I want to hear this, rob.

00:38:21,156 --> 00:38:24,360
I will work Harder than Anyone
has ever worked for you.

00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:24,860
I swear.

00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:28,063
I've been dedicating
my entire life to this.

00:38:28,063 --> 00:38:29,798
I have a pad next to my desk
that I sleep on

00:38:29,798 --> 00:38:31,800
and wake up and work.

00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,402
I do not stop working,
dude.

00:38:34,803 --> 00:38:35,804
How much debt
is on the company?

00:38:35,804 --> 00:38:36,805
None.

00:38:36,805 --> 00:38:41,410
♪♪

00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:43,011
You may want to take
a nice swig of the water,

00:38:43,011 --> 00:38:45,748
'cause I got an offer
coming to you.

00:38:45,748 --> 00:38:46,548
You're kidding.

00:38:46,548 --> 00:38:50,953
♪♪

00:38:55,991 --> 00:38:59,027
Four of the sharks
are out.

00:38:59,027 --> 00:39:01,029
But Daymond is interested.

00:39:01,029 --> 00:39:03,365
How much debt
is on the company?

00:39:03,365 --> 00:39:05,100
None.

00:39:07,703 --> 00:39:09,571
You may want to take
a nice swig of the water,

00:39:09,571 --> 00:39:11,240
'cause I got an offer
coming to you.

00:39:13,842 --> 00:39:16,512
You're kidding.

00:39:16,512 --> 00:39:19,114
I'll give you $300,000
for 40%

00:39:19,114 --> 00:39:21,116
with this contingency--

00:39:21,116 --> 00:39:22,451
We have...

00:39:22,451 --> 00:39:25,988
to get it into
a big-box retailer.

00:39:27,322 --> 00:39:28,323
What do you think
about 20%?

00:39:28,323 --> 00:39:31,693
I think that you're coming
in here for smart money, right?

00:39:31,693 --> 00:39:33,829
Yep.

00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,165
But I also believe $300,000
for 40%

00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:38,300
is what this deal is worth.

00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,302
I'll just sort of sum up

00:39:40,302 --> 00:39:43,305
what the--the--what the, uh,
what I'm selling here.

00:39:43,305 --> 00:39:43,705
No, you don't need to.
(Mark) No, no.

00:39:43,705 --> 00:39:45,174
He's made you an offer.

00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:46,842
(inhales and exhales)

00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:48,510
I would ask you, uh, can I
call my business partner?

00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,379
I have an advisor,
graduated from Cornell.

00:39:50,379 --> 00:39:51,847
He's an amazing guy,

00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:54,450
and he would give me
great advice on this.

00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:55,717
Absolutely.
You want to call? Sure.
Yes.

00:39:55,717 --> 00:39:58,387
Thank you, guys. I--no--No hard
feelings that you're out.

00:39:58,387 --> 00:40:00,389
No big deal. I appreciate
your offer, Daymond.

00:40:00,389 --> 00:40:01,857
Okay.
Thanks a lot.

00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:05,127
Is he leaving?

00:40:05,127 --> 00:40:06,695
(man) Hey, Rusty.
How's it going?

00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:08,030
It's going great, man.

00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,098
I was, uh, a little confusing,
I guess,

00:40:10,098 --> 00:40:12,434
on the way
that I presented things.

00:40:12,434 --> 00:40:13,569
Daymond, I'm shocked.

00:40:13,569 --> 00:40:16,171
Daymond, that was
the most confusing presentation

00:40:16,171 --> 00:40:17,906
we've seen in...

00:40:17,906 --> 00:40:20,909
all the sharks are out
except, uh, Daymond.

00:40:20,909 --> 00:40:22,444
Okay.

00:40:22,444 --> 00:40:23,579
And he's offering 40 per--

00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:26,715
$300,000 for 40%.

00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:28,116
So basically,

00:40:28,116 --> 00:40:32,254
he's valuing the company
at $700,000.

00:40:32,254 --> 00:40:34,256
It's so not worth
3 million bucks.

00:40:34,256 --> 00:40:35,390
Guys, stop talking me
out of this.

00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:36,725
I'm gonna--I'm gonna ask
one more question,

00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:39,761
and then if they, uh,
if they're good with it, good.

00:40:39,761 --> 00:40:40,762
And, uh, we'll figure it out.

00:40:40,762 --> 00:40:43,031
Sounds great. All right.
Good luck, bud.

00:40:43,031 --> 00:40:44,366
All right.

00:40:44,366 --> 00:40:46,235
There's so much competition,
Daymond.

00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:46,601
Yes,
this is a challenge.

00:40:46,601 --> 00:40:50,239
But these are
badass-looking bottles.

00:40:51,974 --> 00:40:54,176
Okay, Rusty,
before you say anything,

00:40:54,176 --> 00:40:55,844
let's just summarize
where we're at.

00:40:55,844 --> 00:40:56,979
Okay.

00:40:56,979 --> 00:40:58,981
There's only one shark left--
Daymond--

00:40:58,981 --> 00:40:59,915
Who's interested in your deal.

00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:03,519
He offered you $300,000,
not for 10%--

00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:05,187
what you wanted.

00:41:05,187 --> 00:41:07,322
It's $300,000 for 40%

00:41:07,322 --> 00:41:08,991
with a contingency

00:41:08,991 --> 00:41:10,325
that the retailers
you've been talking about

00:41:10,325 --> 00:41:11,827
that are so excited
about your product

00:41:11,827 --> 00:41:15,631
actually bring it in
and start selling it.

00:41:15,631 --> 00:41:16,698
What are you going to do?

00:41:18,567 --> 00:41:21,103
I would really, um...

00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:22,104
like to see what you thought

00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:24,840
about bringing
a couple of more sharks in--

00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:27,442
Mark Cuban and Lori--

00:41:27,442 --> 00:41:28,510
for the demo purposes

00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:29,978
as well as the mavs

00:41:29,978 --> 00:41:34,316
and the sports, uh,
licensing potential there.

00:41:34,316 --> 00:41:36,318
Rusty, I'll tell you the truth,
to tell you the truth, though,

00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:38,053
this is such a gamble
and a flier

00:41:38,053 --> 00:41:40,989
that I would want
that big reward.

00:41:40,989 --> 00:41:43,258
So I wouldn't want them
in the deal.

00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:47,763
$300,000 for 40%.

00:41:47,763 --> 00:41:50,499
And you guys are all
still out for sure, 100%?

00:41:50,499 --> 00:41:50,865
He just said he didn't
want us in,

00:41:50,865 --> 00:41:52,434
so it's his call.

00:41:52,434 --> 00:41:54,102
Okay, so you guys--
You guys offers are still

00:41:54,102 --> 00:41:54,970
completely off the table
after I left?

00:41:56,905 --> 00:42:00,175
Unless you want
to give up more equity.

00:42:00,175 --> 00:42:01,310
No. Absolutely. Daymond.

00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,178
All right. Good.
You're the man.
Let's do this, man.

00:42:03,178 --> 00:42:04,179
You guys are r--
Gonna regret this.

00:42:04,179 --> 00:42:06,648
I guarantee you, dude.

00:42:08,584 --> 00:42:11,987
Actually,
I forgot my bottle.

00:42:13,922 --> 00:42:16,058
I'm speechless.

00:42:16,058 --> 00:42:17,059
How surprised are you,
D.J.?

00:42:17,059 --> 00:42:20,228
I am surprised. I didn't think
he was gonna take 40%.

00:42:20,228 --> 00:42:21,830
I was waiting
for you to say no,

00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,765
and then I could get back
into the royalty game with him.

00:42:23,765 --> 00:42:25,567
Squeeze his head
like a teenage pimple.

00:42:25,567 --> 00:42:27,035
(laughs)

00:42:27,035 --> 00:42:29,171
(laughs)

00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:30,839
I think Daymond gets it
and I think we're gonna kill it.

00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:31,840
And I think all the sharks
are gonna regret

00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,909
not being a part of it.
