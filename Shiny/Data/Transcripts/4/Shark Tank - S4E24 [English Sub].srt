 "Mr. Wonderful,

00:07:17,535 --> 00:07:20,205
 And this doesn't mean you won't
 open the restaurant.

00:07:20,205 --> 00:07:22,507
 Yes, it does.
 I forbid you.
 If they get to 20,
 30 trucks...

00:07:22,507 --> 00:07:24,209
 I forbid you to ever
 open that restaurant.

00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:26,211
 Why? Why would you
 say that?

00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:27,612
 Because it's a really
 bad idea.

00:07:27,612 --> 00:07:29,080
 You have a business
 that's making money.

00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,615
 You've just proven
 the concept.

00:07:30,615 --> 00:07:35,954
 Why have you decided to open
 a brick-and-mortar operation

00:07:35,954 --> 00:07:39,257
 instead of replicating
 this truck?

00:07:39,257 --> 00:07:42,293
 I think there's a cap-out
 on the trucks.

00:07:42,293 --> 00:07:45,930
 It's a cash business. Um,
 you have to be so hands-on.
 You have to be present.

00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,199
 And... we really want--
 there you go!

00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:50,034
 There you go!
 Hands-On--

00:07:50,034 --> 00:07:51,769
 Ding, ding, ding, ding,
 ding, ding, ding!

00:07:51,769 --> 00:07:53,938
 No, I'm on that truck
 every single day.

00:07:53,938 --> 00:07:55,507
 I work my ass off.
 You understand that when you
 own a restaurant...

00:07:55,507 --> 00:07:57,242
 Erica, so what?
 You're putting in 80 hours
 a week

00:07:57,242 --> 00:07:58,643
 in the restaurant, too.
 Absolutely.

00:07:58,643 --> 00:08:00,712
 I've worked in restaurants,
 I've lived in them,

00:08:00,712 --> 00:08:03,047
 I've opened them,
 I've put my money in them.

00:08:03,047 --> 00:08:05,383
 It takes ten times more money
 to open one restaurant

00:08:05,383 --> 00:08:07,152
 than set up one more truck.

00:08:07,152 --> 00:08:09,320
 You're right.
 You could have ten times
 the leverage,

00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,457
 ten times the sales,
 with the same amount of money.

00:08:12,457 --> 00:08:14,626
 I understand your point
 to expand on the trucks.

00:08:14,626 --> 00:08:16,427
 It was our vision to really
 go for it

00:08:16,427 --> 00:08:17,962
 and do the brick-and-mortars.

00:08:17,962 --> 00:08:20,365
 None of your data
 works in a brick-and-mortar.

00:08:20,365 --> 00:08:22,500
 It is a completely
 different business.

00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,637
 Good pitch on the truck.

00:08:25,637 --> 00:08:28,273
 Bad pitch on
 the brick-and-mortar. I'm out.

00:08:30,241 --> 00:08:32,810
 I kind of get why finally--

00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,679
 why you want to open
 a restaurant.

00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,148
 I think you're looking for
 a home for your business.

00:08:37,148 --> 00:08:39,284
 You just want to settle in
 Somewhere.

00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:42,253
 Um, what disturbs me--
 You love to invest

00:08:42,253 --> 00:08:44,722
 in a business where someone's
 in love with their business,

00:08:44,722 --> 00:08:47,325
 instead of the guy who's trying
 to get out of that business

00:08:47,325 --> 00:08:49,060
 and get into the new business.

00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,629
 The idea that you're
 escaping

00:08:51,629 --> 00:08:53,431
 what you're doing now
 and don't want it anymore

00:08:53,431 --> 00:08:55,967
 makes me want
 to escape it, too,

00:08:55,967 --> 00:08:57,368
 so I'm out.

00:09:00,338 --> 00:09:02,473
 The truck
 isn't going anywhere.

00:09:02,473 --> 00:09:04,075
 I mean, we'll always
 have the truck.
 It's absolutely not going anywhere.

00:09:04,075 --> 00:09:05,577
 The truck will help
 the restaurant,

00:09:05,577 --> 00:09:07,412
 and the restaurant
 will help the truck.
 Right.

00:09:07,412 --> 00:09:09,447
 Although I love seeing
 a truck, and you're right,

00:09:09,447 --> 00:09:11,216
 maybe it would be great
 to see ten Baby's trucks,

00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:12,584
 I see bigger than that.

00:09:12,584 --> 00:09:14,686
 That's always been
 the bigger picture with us.

00:09:14,686 --> 00:09:17,455
 Guys, I-I see the--the value.

00:09:17,455 --> 00:09:18,990
 I also see the constraints
 on the truck.

00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,326
 But it's a very
 binary decision.

00:09:21,326 --> 00:09:23,728
 Either it takes off
 and explodes,

00:09:23,728 --> 00:09:25,763
 or it craters
 very, very quickly

00:09:25,763 --> 00:09:28,900
 Like any number of--of people
 who had a lot of vision,

00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,135
 a lot of hope,
 and a lot of great burgers.

00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:35,306
 Also, I know $350,000
 is not gonna get it done.

00:09:35,306 --> 00:09:37,909
 I don't think you really
 put the numbers on paper enough

00:09:37,909 --> 00:09:40,878
 to really dig in to see
 what it's going to take,

00:09:40,878 --> 00:09:43,281
 and for that reason,
 I'm out.

00:09:45,883 --> 00:09:47,752
 I'm gonna give you a 9
 out of 10 on the Burger.

00:09:47,752 --> 00:09:49,520
 I'm a burger connoisseur.

00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,689
 We love that. Thank you.
 I've eaten them from
 all around the world.

00:09:51,689 --> 00:09:53,224
 There's nothing wrong
 with the product.

00:09:53,224 --> 00:09:56,094
 But I'm gonna give you
 a 1 out of 10 on your strategy.

00:09:56,094 --> 00:09:58,263
 You charbroiled a great idea.
 You killed it.

00:09:58,263 --> 00:10:01,266
 I mean, you have
 a fantastic business.

00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:03,167
 But I think you came in here
 and got slaughtered

00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:04,636
 by trying to push us
 in a direction

00:10:04,636 --> 00:10:06,137
 that you hadn't proven.

00:10:06,137 --> 00:10:07,805
 Had you said you could do
 ten trucks

00:10:07,805 --> 00:10:10,908
 and you wanted $500,000,
 that might've been interesting.

00:10:10,908 --> 00:10:12,644
 Um...

00:10:12,644 --> 00:10:14,279
 I think you made
 a classic mistake in here

00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,647
 in the shark tank today.

00:10:17,548 --> 00:10:19,651

 I've been listening
 very closely.

00:10:23,688 --> 00:10:28,426
 What I was listening for
 was that at any given time

00:10:28,426 --> 00:10:30,795
 as we were speaking,
 as partners,

00:10:30,795 --> 00:10:32,263
 you would have said,
 "You know what?

00:10:32,263 --> 00:10:33,831
 "Maybe we are being
 too aggressive,

00:10:33,831 --> 00:10:36,067
 "and we're ready
 to rethink that concept

00:10:36,067 --> 00:10:39,237
 and roll out the trucks
 and make some money."

00:10:39,237 --> 00:10:43,741
 but you're too stuck
 on what you wanna do.

00:10:43,741 --> 00:10:45,543
 And I was ready to give you
 the money.

00:10:47,045 --> 00:10:48,713
 Too late. I'm out.

 together,

 "Give me money
 and then we'll do the work."

 absolutely.

 "We don't like it."

 correct.

00:14:49,921 --> 00:14:52,223
 (Barbara) So we don't
 put in money?
 We don't want you to risk
 your money.

00:14:52,223 --> 00:14:53,858
 Often, what happens is,
 people go out

00:14:53,858 --> 00:14:55,860
 and they put a script together
 and they get an actor,

00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,696
 and then they come to a company
 like the one I used to run,

00:14:58,696 --> 00:15:01,132
 where we would finance
 films.
 Do you have an actor?

00:15:01,132 --> 00:15:03,067
 No. By design
 we don't have an actor.

00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:05,236
 Specifically don't have
 an actor attached.

00:15:05,236 --> 00:15:07,138
 Okay, so I know mark is--
 I know mark is already out--

00:15:07,138 --> 00:15:08,873
 We're getting him back in.
 He's coming back.

00:15:08,873 --> 00:15:10,908
 I've heard this story
 many times before.
 Yes.

00:15:10,908 --> 00:15:13,010
 Um, I executive-produced
 "The Crow."

00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,980
 Yes, we know that.
 (Kevin) You make any money?

00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,382
 It became a horror flick in
 regards to making my money back.

00:15:18,382 --> 00:15:20,251
 (laughter)

00:15:20,251 --> 00:15:21,986
 So... I'm out.

00:15:21,986 --> 00:15:23,754
 (Robert) This is a record.
 Now--

00:15:23,754 --> 00:15:25,923
 This is the fastest two guys
 have ever dropped out.

00:15:25,923 --> 00:15:27,758
 We're gonna get them back in.
 We're gonna get you back.

00:15:27,758 --> 00:15:29,260
 We are gonna put together
 a package

00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:32,496
 that you won't spend one dime
 until we show you

00:15:32,496 --> 00:15:34,599
 foreign sales,
 domestic sales,

00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:36,734
 distribution deals,
 product placement.

00:15:36,734 --> 00:15:38,069
 You know, the film business

00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:39,403
 is a bit of a chicken
 before the egg.

00:15:39,403 --> 00:15:40,738
 You can make it happen
 if you have the money.

00:15:40,738 --> 00:15:42,073
 You can make it happen
 if you have

00:15:42,073 --> 00:15:43,574
 the best script in the world.
 You can make it happen

00:15:43,574 --> 00:15:44,709
 if you have
 the best actor in the world.

00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:46,377
 You know,
 and you can make it happen

00:15:46,377 --> 00:15:47,812
 if you're the right people.

00:15:47,812 --> 00:15:49,313
 Why would we have
 confidence in you

00:15:49,313 --> 00:15:51,415
 and give you $5 million?
 What's your background?

00:15:51,415 --> 00:15:52,917
 So, film-wise, I've been
 in the business

00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:54,418
 for about 12 years or so.

00:15:54,418 --> 00:15:56,420
 I've been head of production--
 Head of physical production

00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,990
 for a--for a very
 successful indie company.

00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,425
 We secured a 9-picture
 distro deal

00:16:01,425 --> 00:16:03,260
 with a major studio.

00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,062
 We've produced eight feature
 films that went theatrical.

00:16:05,062 --> 00:16:07,498
 And...
 how many--How many did you
 make money on?

00:16:07,498 --> 00:16:09,533
 We grossed well over
 $200 million.

00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:12,003
 "Mr. Brooks" is one
 that did fairly well.

00:16:12,003 --> 00:16:14,972
 It was Kevin Costner,
 Demi Moore, uh, Dane Cook.

00:16:14,972 --> 00:16:16,674
 Did a movie
 called "Waiting..."

00:16:16,674 --> 00:16:18,342
 that did
 very, very, very well.

00:16:18,342 --> 00:16:19,944
 And what about you, James?

00:16:19,944 --> 00:16:21,712
 What about you?
 What's your background here?

00:16:21,712 --> 00:16:22,947
 Uh, when I was younger,
 I was on Broadway.

00:16:22,947 --> 00:16:24,615
 I came to L.A., did stunts.

00:16:24,615 --> 00:16:26,384
 You know, I'm a huge
 motorcycle fan.

00:16:26,384 --> 00:16:29,186
 And there's been such a lack
 of movies made about them.

00:16:29,186 --> 00:16:31,355
 (Robert) I have an issue
 with the subject matter.
 Yes, sir?

00:16:31,355 --> 00:16:34,725
 I love racing, but not many
 people in North America

00:16:34,725 --> 00:16:36,027
 Love motorcycle racing.
 Correct.

00:16:36,027 --> 00:16:37,728
 Absolutely.

00:16:37,728 --> 00:16:40,231
 Americans love nascar,
 not this kind of racing.
 Correct.

00:16:40,231 --> 00:16:43,300
 When we attach an actor,
 that will sell to America.

00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,336
 If I put, uh, Ryan Gosling
 in this,

00:16:45,336 --> 00:16:47,438
 my girlfriend's gonna go see it
 because of Ryan Gosling.

00:16:47,438 --> 00:16:49,040
 But earlier you said that
 the actor's not important.

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,675
 No, uh...
 now you're saying he is.

00:16:50,675 --> 00:16:52,410
 I'm gonna jump in here
 for a second.

00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,811
 The actor's not attached
 by design.

00:16:53,811 --> 00:16:55,312
 We're too early
 in the stages.

00:16:55,312 --> 00:16:56,580
 If I put an actor
 to it at this point,

00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,215
 when we got down the road,

00:16:58,215 --> 00:16:59,850
 it may not warrant
 the sales that I need.

00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,385
 Walk me through
 the numbers a little bit.

00:17:01,385 --> 00:17:03,621
 I give you $5 million today.
 You don't have a script.

00:17:03,621 --> 00:17:05,256
 You don't have an actor.
 (James) We have a story.

00:17:05,256 --> 00:17:08,292
 What happens to my cash--
 What we wanna do
 is take your money,

00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:10,728
 put it into let's say
 an escrow account

00:17:10,728 --> 00:17:12,096
 or some kind of interest-bearing
 account

00:17:12,096 --> 00:17:13,631
 to where we can't touch it.

00:17:13,631 --> 00:17:16,500
 At that time, we can go and put
 the package together for you.

00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,736
 We'll have a list of ten actors
 that fit the leading roles--

00:17:18,736 --> 00:17:21,972
 So can't start the project
 until people know...
 until you approve of everything.

00:17:21,972 --> 00:17:23,340
 That the cash is there?

00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,210
 We will not start the project
 until you're happy

00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:29,280
 with the calculated risk
 that you would have to take.

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,915
 Because it would be
 very minimal.

00:17:30,915 --> 00:17:32,249
 Otherwise, we don't do
 the movie.

00:17:32,249 --> 00:17:33,617
 Guys, let--Let me try
 to help you out.

00:17:33,617 --> 00:17:36,821
 When you take a movie,
 and you have money behind it,

00:17:36,821 --> 00:17:39,490
 then all the people you're
 pitching to think you're real.

00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:42,059
 You're using our money
 as bait, basically?
 Correct.

00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:43,894
 Yes, absolutely.
 Absolutely.
 Yeah. Absolutely.

00:17:43,894 --> 00:17:45,529
 The movie business--

00:17:45,529 --> 00:17:47,698
 It's the worst business
 I've ever seen in my life.

00:17:47,698 --> 00:17:49,300
 But it can also be a very
 lucrative business.

00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,035
 I can't give you a dime
 until I see the script,

00:17:51,035 --> 00:17:53,938
 I know who's att--Like, I just
 can't get my mind around that.

00:17:53,938 --> 00:17:56,540
 Brian, I think you're
 doing this 'cause you can't--

00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,875
 'cause you're stuck

00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,376
 And you can't get the money
 any other way.

00:17:59,376 --> 00:18:00,878
 Oh, no...

00:18:00,878 --> 00:18:03,214
 why? Why should I take
 the risk today?

00:18:03,214 --> 00:18:05,850
 (James) Here's the other thing
 that we're all forgetting about.

00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:09,353
 This has such a massive,
 built-In audience that--

00:18:09,353 --> 00:18:11,489
 You have nothing today!

00:18:11,489 --> 00:18:14,391
 Who's still left
 on the executive producer List?

00:18:14,391 --> 00:18:16,427
 Uh, we're not--We're out--
 We're already out, guys.

00:18:16,427 --> 00:18:17,728
 We're already out.
 Definitely?

00:18:17,728 --> 00:18:19,029
 (Daymond) We're out.
 All right.

00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:20,631
 All right, you know,
 take it down.

00:18:20,631 --> 00:18:21,966
 (Mark) Take 'em off.
 (Robert) Oh, that's funny.

00:18:21,966 --> 00:18:23,701
 Ohh... (laughing)
 (Daymond) oh!

00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:25,636
 Oh...

00:18:25,636 --> 00:18:28,038
 well, I see Mr. Wonderful's
 next on the list,

00:18:28,038 --> 00:18:29,707
 so let--Let him speak.
 Yes, sir.

00:18:29,707 --> 00:18:30,841
 Please do.

00:18:30,841 --> 00:18:33,043
 It is a horrifically bad idea.

00:18:33,043 --> 00:18:35,479
 I forbid you to proceed.
 I'm out.

00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:36,747
 Okay.
 Okay.

00:18:36,747 --> 00:18:38,716
 Mr. Wonderful's next.
 (Robert) No!

00:18:38,716 --> 00:18:40,384
 (James) He's going...
 (Barbara laughs)

00:18:40,384 --> 00:18:42,419
 (James)
 We got Barbara and rob.

00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:43,888
 (Barbara) It's a--I'm next,
 I'm next.

00:18:43,888 --> 00:18:45,589
 But I can't picture myself
 going home

00:18:45,589 --> 00:18:48,993
 and Telling my teenage son who
 I won't let get a motorcycle,

00:18:48,993 --> 00:18:52,396
 "I'm financing a film
 on motorcycle racing."

00:18:52,396 --> 00:18:53,898
 Scare the crap out of me.

00:18:53,898 --> 00:18:55,366
 It's not my kind of thing.
 I'm out.

00:18:55,366 --> 00:18:56,901
 Okay.
 Vanna?

00:18:56,901 --> 00:18:58,202
 (Daymond and mark laughing)
 "Vanna."

00:18:58,202 --> 00:18:59,770
 (Barbara) Take me down.
 Take me on down.

00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,206
 Okay, hold on
 because now

00:19:02,206 --> 00:19:03,974
 this has become an issue.
 And...

00:19:03,974 --> 00:19:05,442
 (Robert) What's going on?

00:19:05,442 --> 00:19:08,312
 It's going down to you,
 Robert.
 (laughter)

00:19:08,312 --> 00:19:10,314
 (Brian) There's
 a producer left.
 (laughter continues)

00:19:10,314 --> 00:19:12,917
 You gotta give an "a"
 for showmanship, right?

00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:14,285
 That's great.
 You know, Robert--

00:19:14,285 --> 00:19:15,653
 and we anticipated this.
 We anticipated this,

00:19:15,653 --> 00:19:17,822
 so we figured you'd want
 to be in the race as well.

00:19:17,822 --> 00:19:19,757
 You'll be in the movie, so...
 (sharks) Ohh!

00:19:19,757 --> 00:19:22,560
 (Barbara) Gotta say yes.
 I know you wanna be
 on the track, in the movie,

00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,628
 on the bike.
 Look...

00:19:24,628 --> 00:19:25,996
 ludicrous concept.

00:19:25,996 --> 00:19:27,832
 You're transferring the risk

00:19:27,832 --> 00:19:30,100
 completely from you
 to me.

00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,036
 I can't get there

00:19:32,036 --> 00:19:34,338
 without knowing more
 about it.

00:19:34,338 --> 00:19:35,539
 Okay.
 Okay. We can do that.

00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:36,707
 (Robert) I love racing.
 Yeah.

00:19:36,707 --> 00:19:38,475
 "We'll switch our plan
 just like that."

00:19:38,475 --> 00:19:41,045
 I can't be involved
 on nothing.

00:19:41,045 --> 00:19:43,480
 Okay.
 I have--look, I have...

00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,282
 so... I'm out.
 Okay.

00:19:45,282 --> 00:19:46,817
 Hit it, Vanna.
 Okay, get rid of him.

00:19:46,817 --> 00:19:49,053
 (Robert) No! No!
 There--He's out, Vanna!

00:19:49,053 --> 00:19:50,821
 (sharks) Ohh...

00:19:50,821 --> 00:19:53,591
 good luck, guys.
 Close the cap.

00:19:53,591 --> 00:19:55,025
 Thank you, guys.
 Thank you very much.

00:19:55,025 --> 00:19:56,460
 Good luck, guys.
 We appreciate it.
 Thank you.

 exact same deal

 with a better way
 to teach kids

00:20:18,204 --> 00:20:20,339
 something
 they all want to learn.

00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:22,341
 Whoa.

 ♪♪

00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:32,184
 Hi. My name is Mary Beth Lugo,

00:20:32,184 --> 00:20:34,453
 and this is my product,
 Kazam.

00:20:34,453 --> 00:20:37,123
 I am here today seeking
 $300,000

00:20:37,123 --> 00:20:40,326
 in exchange for 20% equity
 in my business.

00:20:40,326 --> 00:20:43,462
 Kazam is a balance bike
 that is revolutionizing

00:20:43,462 --> 00:20:45,398
 the way kids learn
 how to ride.

00:20:45,398 --> 00:20:47,500
 If you notice, this bike
 does not have pedals,

00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,001
 and here's why.

00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:51,337
 The key to learning
 how to ride a bike

00:20:51,337 --> 00:20:52,705
 is developing balance.

00:20:52,705 --> 00:20:54,407
 Think of it
 as a building process.

00:20:54,407 --> 00:20:55,875
 You take one step at a time.

00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,945
 With Kazam, children are
 able to learn by themselves

00:20:58,945 --> 00:21:01,180
 at their own pace,
 which makes it easy

00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,883
 for them to then transition
 onto a regular bicycle.

00:21:03,883 --> 00:21:06,385
 With the help of Kazam,
 kids are having fun,

00:21:06,385 --> 00:21:08,621
 while at the same time
 learning a life skill

00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:10,189
 that will stay with them
 forever.

00:21:10,189 --> 00:21:13,059
 Now, who's ready to ride
 the revolution with me?

00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:14,560
 Beth, I think you should
 send the kiddies off,

00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,728
 because I have a bunch
 of questions

00:21:15,728 --> 00:21:17,163
 they probably
 don't wanna hear.

00:21:17,163 --> 00:21:18,864
 Can you ride off, honey?

00:21:18,864 --> 00:21:21,067
 (Robert) Oh, what a diva.
 She doesn't want to leave.

00:21:21,067 --> 00:21:23,970
 (laughs) So cute.

00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:25,338
 What are you making them for

00:21:25,338 --> 00:21:26,639
 and what are you
 selling them for?

00:21:26,639 --> 00:21:29,075
 We make them for $28.25.

00:21:29,075 --> 00:21:31,177
 The wholesale price
 is $45.

00:21:31,177 --> 00:21:33,012
 Direct to consumer
 for $99.95.

00:21:33,012 --> 00:21:34,714
 Mary Beth, my option,

00:21:34,714 --> 00:21:35,848
 if I'm struggling
 in this economy,

00:21:35,848 --> 00:21:38,150
 is I can buy training wheels
 for $19,

00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:39,652
 or I can buy a Kazam.

00:21:39,652 --> 00:21:41,520
 Both outcomes
 are gonna be the same.

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,922
 Children have been learning
 how to ride a bicycle

00:21:42,922 --> 00:21:44,323
 for decades
 with training wheels.

00:21:44,323 --> 00:21:45,491
 It's that it's improving

00:21:45,491 --> 00:21:47,026
 the way they're
 learning to ride.

00:21:47,026 --> 00:21:49,095
 (Barbara) How did you
 come up with the idea?

00:21:49,095 --> 00:21:50,830
 Born out of need, or...
 actually, this concept
 has been popular

00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,365
 in Europe for some time.

00:21:52,365 --> 00:21:54,066
 We had a European neighbor

00:21:54,066 --> 00:21:55,668
 who introduced us
 to this idea.

00:21:55,668 --> 00:21:58,604
 We tried it with my own child
 who was then 2 at the time,

00:21:58,604 --> 00:22:00,406
 and he learned like that.
 (snaps fingers)

00:22:00,406 --> 00:22:02,108
 Wow.

00:22:02,108 --> 00:22:04,677
 Me made our own design.
 We have a patented frame design.

00:22:04,677 --> 00:22:07,680
 (Barbara) What age category
 would be on this bike?

00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,349
 Maybe 2 1/2
 up to 5, 5 1/2.

00:22:10,349 --> 00:22:11,917
 It kind of depends on--
 but I'm curious to why
 this company

00:22:11,917 --> 00:22:13,652
 already has been doing this
 in Europe,

00:22:13,652 --> 00:22:15,588
 and then they're not
 selling over here

00:22:15,588 --> 00:22:17,490
 if it was a-a product
 in demand.

00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:19,425
 Actually, we are not
 the only ones now

00:22:19,425 --> 00:22:21,160
 in the market
 in the United States.
 Okay.

00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,628
 But what's different
 about ours

00:22:22,628 --> 00:22:24,163
 is the patented
 frame design

00:22:24,163 --> 00:22:25,865
 with the foot rest area.
 And...

00:22:25,865 --> 00:22:28,167
 tell us about your competition.
 How much are they selling?

00:22:28,167 --> 00:22:30,403
 The market's actually
 fragmented right now

00:22:30,403 --> 00:22:32,805
 with several small companies
 like ourselves.

00:22:32,805 --> 00:22:34,673
 How many?
 Five or six, probably.

00:22:34,673 --> 00:22:36,242
 What are your sales,
 Mary Beth?
 Tell us about your sales.

00:22:36,242 --> 00:22:37,743
 You know, what are they...
 to date--

00:22:37,743 --> 00:22:39,245
 We haven't been in business
 quite three years.

00:22:39,245 --> 00:22:40,880
 We have $1.4 million.

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,582
 Whoa. What's your sales
 in the last year

00:22:43,582 --> 00:22:45,017
 and the year before?

00:22:45,017 --> 00:22:47,153
 Last year
 were $611,000.

00:22:47,153 --> 00:22:49,522
 In 2010, they were
 $384,000.

00:22:49,522 --> 00:22:52,324
 Great growth.
 (Kevin) What do you think
 you'll sell next year?

00:22:52,324 --> 00:22:55,995
 Next year we're projecting
 $1.5 million.

00:22:55,995 --> 00:22:59,365
 On the million dollars,
 what will your profit be?

00:22:59,365 --> 00:23:02,468
 The profit margin is
 about 36% to 37%.

00:23:02,468 --> 00:23:04,937
 I have a problem
 with your margins.

00:23:04,937 --> 00:23:06,305
 They're not enough.

00:23:06,305 --> 00:23:08,674
 How do you get them up
 to 45%, 47%?

00:23:08,674 --> 00:23:10,676
 Well, right now we're
 in a situation where

00:23:10,676 --> 00:23:12,812
 we're doing batch
 manufacturing, which means

00:23:12,812 --> 00:23:14,880
 a small quantity
 that we're ordering--

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,715
 1,680 bikes...

00:23:16,715 --> 00:23:18,451
 do you know how many you'd
 have to buy at a time

00:23:18,451 --> 00:23:20,052
 to increase your margins
 by 20%?

00:23:20,052 --> 00:23:21,787
 You gotta get them up
 to close to 50%.

00:23:21,787 --> 00:23:25,191
 We realistically would have
 to get to about 50,000.

00:23:25,191 --> 00:23:26,759
 50--so you've got a ways
 to go then.

00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:28,427
 Fantastic growth.
 If it maintains this way,

00:23:28,427 --> 00:23:30,062
 you're gonna suck up
 a lot of cash.

00:23:30,062 --> 00:23:32,832
 Mm-hmm.
 The only way to get
 some relief from that

00:23:32,832 --> 00:23:34,967
 is to enhance these
 margins dramatically.

00:23:37,436 --> 00:23:38,971
 Okay, Mary Beth.

00:23:38,971 --> 00:23:40,840
 I think what's going to
 happen here is

00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,275
 you're going to require
 a significant amount of capital.

00:23:43,275 --> 00:23:44,877
 And that's what I don't like
 about your deal.

00:23:44,877 --> 00:23:48,881
 Because, for me, it's
 how do I get my money back?

00:23:48,881 --> 00:23:50,449
 I'm not gonna take
 that chance.

00:23:50,449 --> 00:23:52,184
 I'm out.

00:23:52,184 --> 00:23:54,620
 Okay.

00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,222
 And let me just say this--

00:23:56,222 --> 00:23:58,324
 This is not limited
 to toy and bicycle.

00:23:58,324 --> 00:24:00,826
 This bridges to education,
 preschools,

00:24:00,826 --> 00:24:04,063
 daycares,
 occupational therapy.

00:24:04,063 --> 00:24:06,065
 Have you gone back
 to the european market,

00:24:06,065 --> 00:24:07,867
 or are all of your sales
 in north America?

00:24:07,867 --> 00:24:10,202
 Actually, we just got
 picked up by

00:24:10,202 --> 00:24:13,038
 the largest sporting goods
 store in all of Europe.

00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:14,540
 It has 700 stores.

00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,109
 And they just ordered
 a container F.O.B.

00:24:17,109 --> 00:24:19,545
 Okay, so you're talking about
 raising $300,000.

00:24:19,545 --> 00:24:21,547
 What else would you use
 the money for?

00:24:21,547 --> 00:24:23,816
 We'd actually like to create
 an--another product.

00:24:23,816 --> 00:24:25,484
 We want to have
 the 2-Wheeled bike

00:24:25,484 --> 00:24:27,486
 as the next step up
 from the Kazam,

00:24:27,486 --> 00:24:28,988
 for the "Kazam Graduate."
 (Robert) A pedal bike?

00:24:28,988 --> 00:24:30,723
 A pedaled bike.
 Why would you do that?

00:24:30,723 --> 00:24:32,691
 Do you know how competitive
 that is?
 (laughs)

00:24:32,691 --> 00:24:35,427
 That is.
 You can buy a bike
 for $39.

00:24:35,427 --> 00:24:38,597
 That's true, but with
 a quality product

00:24:38,597 --> 00:24:41,267
 and the fact that we've
 created a loyal customer--

00:24:41,267 --> 00:24:43,903
 I forbid you to do that.
 And I'm out.

00:24:43,903 --> 00:24:46,705
 Mary Beth, it sounds like you're
 becoming the market leader.

00:24:46,705 --> 00:24:49,108
 It scares me that you would
 want to go away

00:24:49,108 --> 00:24:52,278
 from something that you're
 great at, you're growing,

00:24:52,278 --> 00:24:54,313
 and then start competing with

00:24:54,313 --> 00:24:56,482
 a huge market
 with huge competitors.

00:24:56,482 --> 00:24:57,816
 Why would you do that?

00:24:57,816 --> 00:24:59,151
 Well, and I'll tell you why--
 Because we get asked

00:24:59,151 --> 00:25:01,387
 all the time
 from our retailers,

00:25:01,387 --> 00:25:03,355
 "When are you coming out
 with something new?"

00:25:03,355 --> 00:25:05,057
 we want to build
 a brand--
 Yeah, you're, you know,

00:25:05,057 --> 00:25:06,425
 you're gonna drown
 in opportunity.

00:25:06,425 --> 00:25:08,727
 Entrepreneurs make
 that mistake every day.

00:25:08,727 --> 00:25:11,363
 Just because somebody asks
 doesn't mean you should do.

00:25:11,363 --> 00:25:14,934
 I commend you on the sales.
 You made a great argument.

00:25:14,934 --> 00:25:16,635
 I mean, you've answered
 all the questions really well.

00:25:16,635 --> 00:25:19,405
 It's just a personal thing.
 I wouldn't buy one.

00:25:19,405 --> 00:25:21,073
 I'm not saying
 that's good or bad.

00:25:21,073 --> 00:25:23,008
 You gotta have somebody along
 for the journey

00:25:23,008 --> 00:25:24,376
 who really believes in it.

00:25:24,376 --> 00:25:27,079
 Um... I'm not that guy.
 I'm out.

00:25:28,847 --> 00:25:31,550
 (Daymond) Uh, I think you have
 a great concept here,

00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,552
 but if I gave you my money,
 I would feel like

00:25:33,552 --> 00:25:35,621
 I would never get it back.

00:25:35,621 --> 00:25:39,024
 I'm out.
 Mm. Okay.

00:25:39,024 --> 00:25:42,661
 What I'm concerned about
 is I don't see your competition

00:25:42,661 --> 00:25:44,330
 as being only
 the tricycle market.

00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:46,332
 It's the tricycle market,
 the training wheel market.

00:25:46,332 --> 00:25:50,135
 It takes a lot of money
 and Real high focus.

00:25:50,135 --> 00:25:53,005
 I'm wondering--
 You have a very mild manner.

00:25:53,005 --> 00:25:55,574
 Are you the type of person
 that could do that?

00:25:55,574 --> 00:25:57,343
 Really? I'm surprised
 you said that. (laughs)

00:25:57,343 --> 00:25:59,078
 I just don't feel
 that fire in you.

00:25:59,078 --> 00:26:00,579
 Listen, I'm the one
 that's running

00:26:00,579 --> 00:26:01,947
 the day-to-day operations.

00:26:01,947 --> 00:26:04,850
 I could picture you
 as organized, but again,

00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:07,219
 even in that answer, I don't
 feel that fire coming out.

00:26:07,219 --> 00:26:10,122
 Are you willing to pour boiling
 oil over your competitors?
 (laughter)

00:26:10,122 --> 00:26:12,024
 (Mark) Yeah.
 That's what she's asking you.

00:26:12,024 --> 00:26:14,493
 In a nice way.
 Are you saying
 she's not aggressive?

00:26:14,493 --> 00:26:17,229
 I'm not sure.
 I'm here because
 I want to blast them away.

00:26:17,229 --> 00:26:20,899
 I want to emerge this company
 as the Leader in this market.

00:26:20,899 --> 00:26:22,568
 Barbara's right.
 When you get a chance

00:26:22,568 --> 00:26:24,903
 to step on the throat
 of your competitor,

00:26:24,903 --> 00:26:27,539
 you just gotta step, squish...

00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:29,408
 gosh.
 And let the roadkill be
 picked up by somebody else.

00:26:29,408 --> 00:26:32,811
 You give articulate answers,
 nice and steady as you go,

00:26:32,811 --> 00:26:35,481
 but I'm looking
 for that thing, that heat!

00:26:37,049 --> 00:26:40,419
 You're right. I'm a shy person.
 I'm a reserved person.

00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:43,188
 But I have spent
 every day

00:26:43,188 --> 00:26:45,124
 of the last three years
 working on this

00:26:45,124 --> 00:26:47,393
 because I know
 it's a proven concept.

00:26:47,393 --> 00:26:49,528
 I know that we can be
 the Leader.

00:26:49,528 --> 00:26:51,864
 And I want to be
 that person

00:26:51,864 --> 00:26:55,000
 who is poised and ready
 to enter the mass market

00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,369
 when that time comes.
 You know what? I'm gonna--

00:26:57,369 --> 00:27:00,005
 I'm gonna find out just how much
 killer you have in you.

00:27:00,005 --> 00:27:02,174
 I'm gonna make you an offer.

00:27:02,174 --> 00:27:04,176
 $300,000

00:27:04,176 --> 00:27:05,744
 for 40%...
 (Kevin) Ouch!

00:27:05,744 --> 00:27:07,279
 Okay?
 (Daymond) Ooh.

00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,349
 But it's contingent
 on you convincing Barbara

00:27:10,349 --> 00:27:13,552
 to come in with me.

00:27:22,494 --> 00:27:24,563
 Three sharks are out.

00:27:24,563 --> 00:27:26,332
 Mark has made
 Mary Beth an offer,

00:27:26,332 --> 00:27:28,934
 but she must convince
 a skeptical Barbara

00:27:28,934 --> 00:27:30,769
 to go in on the deal.

00:27:30,769 --> 00:27:33,539
 $300,000 for 40%...

00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:34,606
 (Kevin) Ouch!
 Okay?

00:27:34,606 --> 00:27:36,241
 (Daymond) Ooh.

00:27:36,241 --> 00:27:39,511
 But it's contingent
 on you convincing Barbara

00:27:39,511 --> 00:27:41,613
 to come in with me.

00:27:41,613 --> 00:27:45,284
 So she does not get
 Barbara to come aboard...
 I'm out.

00:27:45,284 --> 00:27:47,619
 And I'm gonna give you
 24 seconds to convince Barbara,

00:27:47,619 --> 00:27:49,621
 so you're going to have to
 come high and Come hard,

00:27:49,621 --> 00:27:52,191
 and we'll find out just
 how aggressive you are.
 (Daymond) Let's go.

00:27:52,191 --> 00:27:53,492
 Mary Beth, I'm gonna
 give it to you right now.

00:27:53,492 --> 00:27:55,661
 You say to Barbara,
 "Listen, you witch."

00:27:55,661 --> 00:27:57,096
 (laughter)
 "If you don't come in
 on this deal,

00:27:57,096 --> 00:27:58,831
 I'm gonna set you on fire
 with Lighter fluid."

00:27:58,831 --> 00:28:00,833
 Set her 24-Second clock,
 please.
 There he goes.

00:28:00,833 --> 00:28:01,900
 Are you ready?
 Go.

00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,035
 Go.

00:28:03,035 --> 00:28:04,403
 I've had to learn
 this business

00:28:04,403 --> 00:28:05,804
 from the ground up.

00:28:05,804 --> 00:28:07,606
 I did not have any prior
 business experience.

00:28:07,606 --> 00:28:10,676
 Nobody knows this company
 more than I do.

00:28:10,676 --> 00:28:13,645
 I get up early, I work while
 my kids are at school,

00:28:13,645 --> 00:28:15,280
 I take them to soccer,
 I come home,

00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,016
 and I work until 11:00 at night
 every single day.

00:28:18,016 --> 00:28:21,520
 This has become my life.

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,390
 And I am not willing
 to walk away from it

00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:26,458
 until we become
 the top leader.

 That's correct.

 $195,000.

00:33:37,235 --> 00:33:39,538
 In our second fiscal year,
 we're in our first quarter,

00:33:39,538 --> 00:33:42,274

 $135,000 already.

00:33:42,274 --> 00:33:44,342
 Guys, look. Photo booths

 What makes you guys
 different?

00:33:46,678 --> 00:33:48,880
 Well, what makes us different
 is that we've cut

00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,248
 the overhead costs
 from most photo booths.

00:33:50,248 --> 00:33:52,818
 Most photo booth companies
 can only service events

00:33:52,818 --> 00:33:54,953
 if they're making
 $1,000 per event,

00:33:54,953 --> 00:33:56,421
 because it's a huge setup.

00:33:56,421 --> 00:33:58,590
 So how much does each
 setup cost you, all in?

00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:00,392
 It costs us about $3,500
 in equipment

00:34:00,392 --> 00:34:03,061
 and about $500 labor
 to actually build the booth.

00:34:03,061 --> 00:34:04,629
 (Robert) How are people
 finding it?

00:34:04,629 --> 00:34:07,265
 As you go to a new market,
 how do I know you're there?

00:34:07,265 --> 00:34:09,835
 Well, we have strategic
 partnerships already set up

00:34:09,835 --> 00:34:12,137

00:34:13,905 --> 00:34:15,407
 So, are there any competitors

00:34:15,407 --> 00:34:17,442
 that are doing
 the same thing you're doing?

00:34:17,442 --> 00:34:19,778
 There are--There are a few
 competitors out there.

00:34:19,778 --> 00:34:21,480
 We're not gonna lie.
 There's a lot of competition.

00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,215
 So what is--Okay, so what's
 your secret sauce,

00:34:23,215 --> 00:34:25,083
 or why are people coming
 to you?

00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:27,319
 Well, one of the big things
 that makes us different

00:34:27,319 --> 00:34:29,287
 is most photo booth companies
 that are out there

00:34:29,287 --> 00:34:31,223
 are mom-and-pop shops
 that are more than happy

00:34:31,223 --> 00:34:33,325
 to just be contained
 in that one area.

00:34:33,325 --> 00:34:35,460
 Lance, do you think
 for $3 million

00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,963

 with pink shirts and black ties,

00:34:37,963 --> 00:34:40,932
 buy some photo equipment,
 advertise in a few cities,

00:34:40,932 --> 00:34:43,168
 and crush you
 like cockroaches?

00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:44,970
 I don't--
 'cause that's the question
 you have to answer.

00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:46,438
 That's the thing
 that matters to me.

00:34:46,438 --> 00:34:47,973
 Now we're talking
 real money.

00:34:47,973 --> 00:34:49,808
 This is not worth $3 million.

00:34:49,808 --> 00:34:51,276
 You know why?

00:34:51,276 --> 00:34:54,012
 There's nothing that's
 proprietary about it. Nothing.

00:34:55,213 --> 00:34:57,315
 $3 million's a joke.
 I'm out.

00:34:58,583 --> 00:35:01,419
 But we're making money.

00:35:01,419 --> 00:35:04,322
 Last 30 days of sales--
 $83,000.

00:35:04,322 --> 00:35:08,660
 This fiscal year, we're slated

00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,996
 with no capital infusion.

00:35:10,996 --> 00:35:12,831
 And what will your profit
 be on that?

00:35:12,831 --> 00:35:15,000
 60%.
 Why do you need the money?

00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,335
 We don't need the money.
 We have great credit.

00:35:17,335 --> 00:35:19,037
 We have--We have banks
 that... (speaks indistinctly)

00:35:19,037 --> 00:35:21,640
 I'll be your partner

00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:24,309
 We need the strategic
 introductions.

 I'm taking $99,000.

00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,384
 I know these don't
 sound like a lot, but...
 oh! Wait a minute.

00:35:32,384 --> 00:35:34,686
 And the company made
 $300,000, correct?

00:35:34,686 --> 00:35:36,888
 $333,000.
 So you took 30%
 out of the company already?

00:35:36,888 --> 00:35:39,057
 No, not yet. No, I just
 started taking a salary

00:35:39,057 --> 00:35:41,860
 just two, three months ago.
 Okay, so you're gonna
 pay yourself $100,000.

00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,528
 What are you gonna pay
 yourself?

00:35:43,528 --> 00:35:45,430
 I haven't really
 thought about it yet.

00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:47,265
 No, no, no. Come on.
 Don't play possum with me.

00:35:47,265 --> 00:35:49,201
 He's getting $100,000.
 Okay.

00:35:49,201 --> 00:35:51,336
 What are you gonna
 pay yourself?
 Same.

00:35:51,336 --> 00:35:52,804
 Same.
 So $200,000.

00:35:52,804 --> 00:35:54,873
 $200,000 in salaries
 already, right?

00:35:54,873 --> 00:35:57,142
 There's nothing wrong
 with that.
 Wait a minute, wait a minute.

00:35:57,142 --> 00:36:02,013
 $200,000 in salaries, and you
 just took $300,000 from us.

00:36:04,683 --> 00:36:07,652
 Okay. Can you generate
 $200,000 in sales?

00:36:07,652 --> 00:36:10,155
 I believe so.
 Okay. You just
 made your money back.

00:36:10,155 --> 00:36:11,323
 Yeah.
 No, that's not right.

 Guys, here--Here's
 the challenge.

00:36:12,724 --> 00:36:14,659
 All you've done is shown
 everybody

00:36:14,659 --> 00:36:16,795
 that there's a unique
 market out there,

00:36:16,795 --> 00:36:19,030
 and while they may not be
 as good as you,

00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:21,366
 you've set the price
 for your service,

00:36:21,366 --> 00:36:23,335
 and the fact that there's
 huge margins

00:36:23,335 --> 00:36:25,103
 for someone to come in
 and undercut you.

00:36:25,103 --> 00:36:27,873
 For that reason,
 I'm out.

00:36:27,873 --> 00:36:31,376
 You don't need the money,
 but yet you want $300,000.

00:36:31,376 --> 00:36:34,713
 You're gonna pay each other
 $100,000 apiece.

00:36:34,713 --> 00:36:37,282
 Only offering us 10%.

00:36:37,282 --> 00:36:39,651
 Wanting us to go out
 and work for you.

00:36:39,651 --> 00:36:41,586
 $300,000 is a lot of money.

00:36:41,586 --> 00:36:44,456
 That is a lot of money...
 (speaks indistinctly)
 Right?

 I'm out.

 you're a great hustler.

 I mean, you guys are out there,
 you're doing it.

00:36:53,965 --> 00:36:56,902
 You're not the reason
 I can't be in.

00:36:56,902 --> 00:36:58,837
 My time is the reason.

00:36:58,837 --> 00:37:00,305
 You know--
 We just need
 a half an hour a week.

00:37:00,305 --> 00:37:01,840
 That's all we're asking
 of your time.

00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,074
 I-I gotta be out.

00:37:03,074 --> 00:37:05,911

 I think you got
 a good thing going here.

00:37:17,422 --> 00:37:21,092
 I think you're... you're
 like an eveready battery.

00:37:21,092 --> 00:37:23,128
 I think your valuation
 is way high.

00:37:23,128 --> 00:37:24,663
 I think you know that
 already.

00:37:24,663 --> 00:37:27,899

 $300,000

 all right?
 Okay.

00:37:30,168 --> 00:37:32,504
 The only thing I want is
 when you pull your $100,000,

 I don't care
 about necessarily

 getting my money out
 immediately.

00:38:30,857 --> 00:38:33,627
 I care about the growth.
 What I would do is

00:38:33,627 --> 00:38:34,861
 do a deal comparable
 to Barbara--

00:38:34,861 --> 00:38:37,597
 $300k for a third--

 anything back

 a million dollars, so...

00:38:42,535 --> 00:38:44,404
 that's only one year.
 Yeah, one year.

00:38:44,404 --> 00:38:46,039
 Well, it's one year or two year,
 but at least you get there.

00:38:47,641 --> 00:38:50,310
 I can get you to
 the event organizers.

00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,978

 axs tv

 setting them up
 at festivals.

00:38:56,983 --> 00:39:00,086
 Branding it as axs tv,
 and having it there,

00:39:00,086 --> 00:39:01,488
 the challenge
 is going to be

00:39:01,488 --> 00:39:03,456
 we'd have to move
 incredibly fast,

00:39:03,456 --> 00:39:06,459
 simply because I think
 competition is a huge risk.

00:39:06,459 --> 00:39:08,295

 And then, Barbara, what will you
 be bringing to the table?

 there is a difference.

 'cause if you were to speak
 to all of my entrepreneurs,

 makes the difference

 Okay. Thanks.

 That was a creepy thing to do.
 Absolutely.

00:39:47,133 --> 00:39:48,969
 What'd you do that for?
 Because once it became a good
 deal, it was a good deal.

00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:51,237
 At $3 million,
 it wasn't a good deal.
