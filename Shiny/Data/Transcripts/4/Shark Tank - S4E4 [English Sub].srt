00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,270
The sharks are back,

00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,180
in an all-new season
of "Shark Tank,"

00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,420
Where hopeful entrepreneurs
from across the country

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,230
dream of a chance

00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:12,020
to secure an investment
and gain powerful partners

00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,280
to start, grow,
or save their businesses.

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,400
Are you currently
selling this anywhere?

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,080
Well,
we're a pre-revenue startup.

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,220
Something smells
a little funny here.

00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,070
If the sharks hear
a great idea,

00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,220
they're ready to invest
using their own money...

00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,470
I won't kill your money.

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,330
You've killed a lot of money
before mine.

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,070
And they'll fight each other
for a piece of the action.

00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,320
You know,
nice guys finish last.

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,030
You okay?
(crying)

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,170
That's not true. Nice guys
finish first all the time.

00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,020
But first, the entrepreneurs
must convince a shark

00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,380
to invest the full amount
they're asking for,

00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,380
or they'll walk away
with Nothing.

00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,120
Cubes, let me--
Let me jump in there.

00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,170
Cubes? Just for calling me
"Cubes," I'm out.

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,230
It's sink...

00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,270
I think we can make
something great happen.

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,480
Or swim.

00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,000
Not every football player

Darwinian ways you don't know,

a pleasant experience.

Who are the sharks?

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,250
They're self-made millionaire

00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,400

Nique and I have been married
for five years.

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,400
I met her my very first weekend
here in Florida.

00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,130
I landed a job with actually two
of the largest golf companies

00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,300
in the country.

00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,480
But soon after that,
the economy went into the tank.

At that point,

00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,230
my position was eliminated,
and I lost my job.

with something quickly,

before I got into
the golf career,

00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,070
so I decided to go after it

00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,350
to start a little
barbecue catering company,

00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,180

lightbulb, so to speak.

After a life-changing event
with me and David,

00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,270
we went ahead and started
a catering company

00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,320
called Back 9 barbecue.

00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,250
And while barbecue was
my specialty,

00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,130
we quickly became known
for our dips.

00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,030
So we decided to bring
these dips to retail,

00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,130
where we built
a very loyal fanbase,

00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,220
from the college students

00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,020

What was
the life-altering event?

00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,030
Well, last time when I was
eight months pregnant,

00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,320
David--He had lost his job.

00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:17,180
And I didn't have a job, so we
did what a lot of people do,

00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,300
and we downsized from
a very large, beautiful house

00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,120
to a very small house.

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,400
We have one car now.
We sold off a lot of things

00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,120
to make sure we kept a roof
over our head.

00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,370
But it's actually
all worked out...
it's been a blessing.

00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,230
For the best. It really has
been a blessing.
It was.

00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:35,300
So now this is your livelihood,
this business?

00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,300
It is.

00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,450
Tell us about
the sales of it.

00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,470
How much do you sell?
How much money do you make?

We're also approaching
about 400 accounts right now.

a big chain down in--in Florida.

00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,320
They gave us a 60-store test.

00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,030
They gave us a number to hit,
a weekly number.

00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,100
We're hitting that--
How's it's going?

00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,170

00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,420
Wow.

00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,350
Our product--the reason
that it sells so well

00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,250
is because of the quality
of the ingredients.

00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,300
People will pay
for a premium product.

00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,300
That's the biggest reason.
And it's--It's pricey

00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,470
to put quality ingredients
together.

00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,220
What does it cost for one?

00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:14,020
It retails anywhere from $7.99
to $8.99 for a 1-Pound tub.

00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,180
And what are
you making it for?

00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:20,000
It costs us roughly $2.52,
and I wholesale for $5.25.

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,420
And how much do you have
invested into the company?

00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,400
We got about $150,000 invested.

00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,480
That takes a lot of guts

00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,020

and go, "Ew!"?

00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,080
I think--
I do think at first,

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,050
they'll take a sample,
they'll keep walking,

00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,220
and then they turn around
and they go, "Wait a minute.

00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,400
"wait a minute.
What did I just eat?

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,100
'Cause that was amazing."

00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,180
And then when people find out
it's a blended chicken,

00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,370
they don't have a problem
with it?

00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,070
They love it. Actually, they
gave us really good feedback.

00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,200
They think
it's a really clever idea.

00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,000
I agree with that.
I think it's wonderful.

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,030
I mean, I really liked it.

00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,430

another one...

00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,220

Guys, I think you're gonna
do wonderful things,

00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,420
but I also know that to be
a great entrepreneur,

00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,320
you have to know
what you're good at

00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,420
and know what
you're not so good at,

00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:37,030
and I'm not so good at
food distribution of this sort.

00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,130
So as much as I-I love what
you guys are doing,

00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,150
because it's not a fit and it
doesn't play to my strengths,

00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,320
I'll have to say I'm out.

00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:49,250
I admire your just
stick-to-it-iveness to survive

00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,230
getting whacked from your job.

00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,250
This is happening
to millions of americans now.

00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,100
It's a tough economy out there,

00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,170
then coming back with something
that's actually working,

00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,320
you're basically
living off this,

00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,450
but as an investment
for a startup, basically.

00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,350
And so there's a huge amount
of risk in it right now.

00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,330
I could put a royalty on it
and force you to pay me

00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,000
on every time you sell one,

00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,280

to those chickens

00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,100

Here's the bad--
It's a brutal business.

00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,000
You need a partner that can
help you go down that road.

00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,350
All I can offer you is--
is advice, encouragement.

00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:39,130
But I can't tell you when
to zig or when to zag,

00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,380

you really need today.

I was in love with him and in
love with the--the concept,

00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,270
but I didn't have enough
knowledge of the business,

00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,230
and then he went off and did
$10 million in business,

00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,350

Absolutely.

I had my little girl,

00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,350
and then my wife was pregnant
with our second,

00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,150
and then L.L. gave me
that shot,

"If anything happens,

00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:12,023
I am the creator and founder
of the lifter hamper.

00:16:12,023 --> 00:16:14,123
I'm asking for $85,000

00:16:14,123 --> 00:16:17,033
in exchange for 12% equity
in my company.

00:16:17,033 --> 00:16:20,333
In 2006, I was drafted to
the Pittsburgh Steelers

00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,103
from Cal Berkeley.

00:16:22,103 --> 00:16:25,373
In the third year of my NFL
career, I suffered a back injury

00:16:25,373 --> 00:16:28,103
that put me of out football
for the remainder of the season.

00:16:28,103 --> 00:16:30,323
Not only
did my football skills suffer,

00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,133
but my laundry skills
suffered, too.

00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:33,303
(laughs)

00:16:33,303 --> 00:16:36,233
Simple things like bending over
to retrieve clothing

00:16:36,233 --> 00:16:38,083
out of the bottom
of the hamper

00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,433
and carrying
those heavy loads of laundry

00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:43,033
from one room to another
became Literally...

00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:44,273
(thud)
a pain in my back.

00:16:44,273 --> 00:16:49,083
That's when the idea of
the lifter hamper came about.

00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:52,273
What the lifter hamper is,
is a bungee spring-loaded liner

00:16:52,273 --> 00:16:55,183
that drops as clothes
going in gets heavier

00:16:55,183 --> 00:16:58,123
and rises as the clothes
coming out gets lighter,

00:16:58,123 --> 00:17:00,103
therefore allowing
the individual

00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:01,233
to pick off
the top of the hamper

00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:02,983
rather than the bottom.

00:17:02,983 --> 00:17:04,333
Now the lifter hamper isn't

00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:07,983
just for injured NFL athletes
like myself,

00:17:07,983 --> 00:17:09,403
but it's for anyone who
has trouble bending over.

00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:12,283
The lifter hamper is for
the 65 million americans

00:17:12,283 --> 00:17:14,033
that suffer from back pain.

00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,403
The lifter hamper
is for pregnant women.

00:17:15,403 --> 00:17:18,223
The lifter hamper is for
the elderly--right, Kevin?

00:17:18,223 --> 00:17:20,003
(Mark and Robert laugh)

00:17:20,003 --> 00:17:21,983
dig him, baby. Dig him.

00:17:21,983 --> 00:17:24,003
So instead of having
to put your back into it,

00:17:24,003 --> 00:17:25,133
take a load off

00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:27,323
and let the lifter hamper
do the work for you.

00:17:27,323 --> 00:17:28,403
So who's with me?

00:17:28,403 --> 00:17:30,333
That's great.

00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,203
Can I try it?
Yeah.

00:17:32,203 --> 00:17:36,073
Can you put a bottomless amount
of, uh, peanuts in there and...

00:17:36,073 --> 00:17:38,223
(laughs)
(laughs) Have it come up.

00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,233
Can you put it by a bar?
Yeah. There you go, right?

00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:43,303
So if I keep
taking things out...
Yeah.

00:17:43,303 --> 00:17:45,473
Can I do this?
Yep.

00:17:45,473 --> 00:17:47,223
It's gonna just keep coming up?

00:17:47,223 --> 00:17:50,253
Yep, and you have
a comforter in there.
And coming up.

00:17:50,253 --> 00:17:52,283
Is it working, Lori?
Yeah.

00:17:52,283 --> 00:17:53,453
Lori, what is it
made out of?

00:17:53,453 --> 00:17:56,003
You know, I don't know.
If feels really cool.

00:17:56,003 --> 00:17:58,173
Marvin, do I get
the whole thing?

00:17:58,173 --> 00:18:01,353
The--the frame, the cover,
everything?
Yeah. Yep.

00:18:04,453 --> 00:18:06,223
Lori, would you buy this
for your house?

00:18:07,934 --> 00:18:09,934
I don't know.
I-I think it's interesting.

00:18:09,934 --> 00:18:12,284
But how you gonna get that
down to your washing machine?

00:18:12,284 --> 00:18:16,064
You're gonna need another hamper
or a basket or something

00:18:16,064 --> 00:18:20,034
to go from bedroom or closet
or wherever you have that--

00:18:20,034 --> 00:18:21,364
You wheel it. It's got wheels.
Yeah, I didn't see wheels.

00:18:21,364 --> 00:18:22,944
So--so as you see
on the bottom,

00:18:22,944 --> 00:18:24,084
there's wheels
on the bottom.

00:18:24,084 --> 00:18:26,964
It's not wheeling great
on that rug, though.

00:18:26,964 --> 00:18:28,284
Can you show it on the wood?
Yeah.

00:18:28,284 --> 00:18:32,334
But if you are going
from upstairs to downstairs,

00:18:32,334 --> 00:18:34,894
that's not going to be easy
to transport

00:18:34,894 --> 00:18:37,034
for the people that need it,
because they can't bend down.

00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:38,114
Yeah.

00:18:38,114 --> 00:18:40,134
So...
all right, good point, Lori.

00:18:40,134 --> 00:18:41,994
This needs some perfecting.

00:18:41,994 --> 00:18:43,244
See, that's what
I'm looking for.

00:18:43,244 --> 00:18:45,244
I'm looking for a mentor to
advise me on what I should do

00:18:45,244 --> 00:18:47,084
and what the next step
should be.

00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,914
How long have you been
doing this?

00:18:48,914 --> 00:18:50,144
Uh, six months.

00:18:50,144 --> 00:18:51,234
Oh, that's all?
Yeah.

00:18:51,234 --> 00:18:53,034
You--You--
It's kind of impressive.

00:18:53,034 --> 00:18:55,284
You know a--you know
a fairly large amount

00:18:55,284 --> 00:18:57,244
of the business
in six months.

00:18:57,244 --> 00:18:58,994
I'm trying.

00:18:58,994 --> 00:19:03,114
Marvin, your company is not
worth the value of $700,000.

00:19:03,114 --> 00:19:06,144
Now either you got hit
too many times,

00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:08,984
or you really have a lot
in sales.

00:19:11,944 --> 00:19:13,234
Actually, we haven't
hit market yet.

00:19:13,234 --> 00:19:15,264
(Mark laughs)
(Daymond and Kevin) Whoa!

00:19:15,264 --> 00:19:17,194
But--One second--

00:19:17,194 --> 00:19:20,014
we have signed two contracts

00:19:20,014 --> 00:19:21,894
with two
of the biggest rep firms.

00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:24,144
Rep firms? Not a store?

00:19:24,144 --> 00:19:26,364
Yeah. And we have contracts
with Amazon and Overstock.

00:19:26,364 --> 00:19:28,114
We had one with Costco.

00:19:28,114 --> 00:19:30,244
We had to scale back
'cause we couldn't fulfill.

00:19:30,244 --> 00:19:33,194
But, Marvin, this is
an agreement, basically,

00:19:33,194 --> 00:19:36,194
with the rep company,
and they're just saying

00:19:36,194 --> 00:19:39,894
they can maybe get you into
Amazon and Fred's and Costco

00:19:39,894 --> 00:19:41,064
and these places.
So yeah--

00:19:41,064 --> 00:19:42,994
But--but there's nothing saying
that they did it.

00:19:42,994 --> 00:19:46,094
This is just like
a "We'll try it." That's it.

00:19:46,094 --> 00:19:48,234
The big question
on that, Lori, is,

00:19:48,234 --> 00:19:49,914
are they charging you
up front?

00:19:49,914 --> 00:19:52,184
No. They get commission
on the back end.

00:19:54,734 --> 00:19:55,774
Marvin,
to the Pittsburgh Guy.

00:19:55,774 --> 00:19:57,004
(laughs)

00:19:57,004 --> 00:19:59,634
Give us the economics.
What does it cost to make one?

00:19:59,634 --> 00:20:02,034
Um, what--what are you selling
for wholesale? Retail?
Okay.

00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:06,924
It costs about $10 to make,
and it retails for $49.99.

00:20:06,924 --> 00:20:08,754
You have a patent
on this thing?

00:20:08,754 --> 00:20:10,584
We were provisional, and then
we just filed our utility.

00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,604
How much money
have you invested so far?

00:20:12,604 --> 00:20:13,834
$75,000.

00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:15,654
What did the money go to?
To the tooling,

00:20:15,654 --> 00:20:18,674
the patent, and design, you
know, to get it to this point.

00:20:18,674 --> 00:20:19,854
Is that a lot of money for you?

00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,674
Yeah, you know,
not every football player

00:20:23,674 --> 00:20:24,984
in the NFL is a millionaire,
you know?

00:20:24,984 --> 00:20:28,074
And So, uh...
you know, it is.

00:20:28,074 --> 00:20:29,734
No, I didn't--I didn't mean
to be disrespectful.

00:20:29,734 --> 00:20:31,754
I'm just--you know,
I just wanna understand

00:20:31,754 --> 00:20:33,684
how committed you are to it.

00:20:33,684 --> 00:20:35,624
This is my full-time job.

00:20:35,624 --> 00:20:37,034
I'm committed.
And--and you know what?

00:20:37,034 --> 00:20:39,624
It means a lot to be because
I suffered a back injury,

00:20:39,624 --> 00:20:41,054
and I still have trouble
bending over.

00:20:41,054 --> 00:20:43,774
And so I've benefitted
from it.

00:20:43,774 --> 00:20:45,934
And so, you know,
that what's what I wanna do,

00:20:45,934 --> 00:20:47,584
is help other people.

00:20:47,584 --> 00:20:48,674
You know, there's millions
of people out there

00:20:48,674 --> 00:20:50,774
that can benefit from it.

00:20:52,034 --> 00:20:54,024
Marvin,
I like it, actually.

00:20:54,024 --> 00:20:56,804
I've herniated two disks
in my back from sports,

00:20:56,804 --> 00:20:58,774
and so I know exactly what
you're saying.

00:20:58,774 --> 00:21:00,834
And--and believe it or not,
I do do my own laundry.

00:21:00,834 --> 00:21:02,934
You know,
I've had to deal with it,

00:21:02,934 --> 00:21:05,634
but it's just not an area
where I have connections.

00:21:05,634 --> 00:21:06,824
Just to say,
you know what?

00:21:06,824 --> 00:21:09,674
"This is a great product.
Place this product for Marvin,

00:21:09,674 --> 00:21:11,874
and--And go sell it for us."
Mm-hmm.

00:21:11,874 --> 00:21:13,854
So for that reason, I'm out.

00:21:15,824 --> 00:21:17,684
So, Marvin,
here's the good news.

00:21:17,684 --> 00:21:19,624
I gotta tell ya,
I think it's a clever product.

00:21:19,624 --> 00:21:22,904
Here's the bad news--
You've got a long way to go.

00:21:22,904 --> 00:21:25,904
I think you just gotta go out
and sell some.

00:21:25,904 --> 00:21:29,034
It's Sunday, baby.
You gotta go play the game.

00:21:29,034 --> 00:21:31,684
You gotta go out
and knock on doors

00:21:31,684 --> 00:21:33,004
and ask for an order--

00:21:33,004 --> 00:21:36,584
Not a rep firm,
not some guy for you.

00:21:36,584 --> 00:21:38,824
But I think you can do it.

00:21:38,824 --> 00:21:40,734
I don't think you need
the money.

00:21:40,734 --> 00:21:42,874
You just need the effort.

00:21:42,874 --> 00:21:44,874
I'm out.
Okay.

00:21:44,874 --> 00:21:47,654
Appreciate it.

00:21:47,654 --> 00:21:49,024
Marvin...

00:21:49,024 --> 00:21:51,924
my heart is in,
and I love you,

00:21:51,924 --> 00:21:54,924
but my gut tells me
you're, like, halfway there.

00:21:54,924 --> 00:21:57,784
You have issues,
things that I've brought up

00:21:57,784 --> 00:21:59,854
that you need to work on.
Mm-hmm.

00:21:59,854 --> 00:22:02,634
And so I'm out
with my money,

00:22:02,634 --> 00:22:06,604
but because my heart is in,
you can give me a call...

00:22:06,604 --> 00:22:07,684
sure.
When you're ready...

00:22:07,684 --> 00:22:08,774
okay.

00:22:08,774 --> 00:22:09,934
And I'll be there
to help you.

00:22:09,934 --> 00:22:11,774
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

00:22:11,774 --> 00:22:12,854
I'm out, though.

00:22:12,854 --> 00:22:15,624
Okay.

00:22:15,624 --> 00:22:18,584
I was waiting to hear
what miss QVC was going to say,

00:22:18,584 --> 00:22:21,734
because to me, this is
a very visual, tactile,

00:22:21,734 --> 00:22:23,834
demonstratable product
on television.

00:22:23,834 --> 00:22:26,054
I would think she'd jump
all over it and in it, frankly.

00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:27,724
(laughs)

00:22:27,724 --> 00:22:29,724
But it doesn't sound like
she's there,

00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:31,734
and I'm a little surprised.

00:22:33,824 --> 00:22:35,774
I don't think it's investable,
Marvin. Not right now.

00:22:35,774 --> 00:22:39,034
And it certainly isn't worth
$700,000.

00:22:39,034 --> 00:22:42,674
I'm just a disciplined investor

00:22:42,674 --> 00:22:44,984
trying to go to bed
richer than I woke up, so--

00:22:44,984 --> 00:22:46,734
aren't we all? (chuckles)

00:22:46,734 --> 00:22:48,874
Well, I think that's what
makes America great.
Yeah.

00:22:48,874 --> 00:22:49,954
But I'm out.

00:22:49,954 --> 00:22:51,604
Thank you.

00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:53,634
Marvin, you come in here,

00:22:53,634 --> 00:22:54,804
and you're
a very, very nice guy.

00:22:54,804 --> 00:22:55,974
I think
we're all rooting for you.

00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:58,074
You know, you're an athlete
who learned the business

00:22:58,074 --> 00:22:59,654
in six months.

00:22:59,654 --> 00:23:00,974
But on the other side,
I mean,

00:23:00,974 --> 00:23:04,754
you're really a shark
because you're offering us 12%

00:23:04,754 --> 00:23:07,584
of a company that really doesn't
have much at this moment.

00:23:07,584 --> 00:23:10,774
And, you know,
nice guys finish last.

00:23:10,774 --> 00:23:12,984
I'm out.

00:23:12,984 --> 00:23:15,704
Thank you. Appreciate it.

00:23:15,704 --> 00:23:16,954
(Mark) Good luck, Marvin.
(Lori) Good luck. Keep thinking.

00:23:16,954 --> 00:23:19,654
Thank you.
(Robert) Hey, Marvin,
that's not true.

00:23:19,654 --> 00:23:20,924
Nice guys finish first
all the time.

00:23:20,924 --> 00:23:23,054
There you go. (laughs)
There you go.

00:23:26,884 --> 00:23:28,924
Me not getting a deal today
will--

00:23:28,924 --> 00:23:30,684
Will make me work
that much Harder

After
a thorough design process,

00:24:13,967 --> 00:24:16,917
we have perfected
an exoskeleton

00:24:16,917 --> 00:24:19,837
that provides structure
to the amorphous blob that is

00:24:19,837 --> 00:24:23,607
a standard 2-gallon,
1-gallon, quart,

00:24:23,607 --> 00:24:24,967
and sandwich-sized
zipper bag.

00:24:24,967 --> 00:24:26,957
By inverting the top
of the zipper bag

00:24:26,957 --> 00:24:28,767
and sliding it down
the sides of the bag bowl,

00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:31,607
consumers can create
a handy and sturdy bowl.

00:24:31,607 --> 00:24:32,937
A great way
to flat-pack consumables

00:24:32,937 --> 00:24:34,657
and take them on the go.

00:24:34,657 --> 00:24:36,907
And when they're finished,
simply zip up the contents

00:24:36,907 --> 00:24:39,587
and throw it into the cooler,
fridge, or cupboard.

00:24:39,587 --> 00:24:41,937
Or if it's empty, into the trash
or recycling bin.

00:24:41,937 --> 00:24:43,687
Wait a minute.
No more cleanup?

00:24:43,687 --> 00:24:44,767
No more cleanup!

(laughs)
The picnic, potluck,
and tailgate

00:24:46,887 --> 00:24:49,037
will never be the same.

00:24:49,037 --> 00:24:51,887
Or how about a convenient way to
get pasta sauce from the stove

00:24:51,887 --> 00:24:54,657
to a bag? Ooh!

00:24:54,657 --> 00:24:56,617
Ahh!

00:24:56,617 --> 00:24:58,887
No more mismatched lids

00:24:59,987 --> 00:25:01,707

00:25:01,707 --> 00:25:03,017
Ah. (laughs)

00:25:03,017 --> 00:25:05,837
What an advantage for, say,
a chip or a peanut manufacturer

00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:09,717
to utilize our technology
to offer their customers

00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:12,637
an exclusive way
to turn the bag into a bowl.

00:25:12,637 --> 00:25:14,767
Yeah! Or How about pioneering

00:25:14,767 --> 00:25:16,067
a single-serving
dog food product?

00:25:16,067 --> 00:25:17,957
Woof! Woof!
Now you're talking, bro.

00:25:17,957 --> 00:25:19,707
(sharks laugh)

00:25:19,707 --> 00:25:21,657
Bag bowl brings convenience,
function, and style

00:25:21,657 --> 00:25:23,007

Our humble goal is to change
the way the world consumes.

Who wants to join us and be
a new Fleming brother or sister

00:25:28,907 --> 00:25:31,617
and help us take the bag bowl
global?

00:25:32,817 --> 00:25:33,987
Can we see it?

00:25:33,987 --> 00:25:35,067
Yeah.
Absolutely.

00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:36,767
Thank you.
Here you guys go.

00:25:36,767 --> 00:25:39,057
As you can see, it folds
totally flat when not in use.

00:25:39,057 --> 00:25:41,617
Thank you, sir.
You're welcome. Thank you.

00:25:41,617 --> 00:25:43,587
Does this come apart
right here?

00:25:43,587 --> 00:25:44,757
No, that's
the ultrasonic weld.

00:25:44,757 --> 00:25:47,037
Uh, it can be microwavable
with certain kind of polymers.

00:25:47,037 --> 00:25:49,587
Guys, how much have you invested
to create this?

00:25:49,587 --> 00:25:52,787
We've put in $40,000
of our own money.

00:25:52,787 --> 00:25:54,617
But before the train gets
too far down the track,

00:25:54,617 --> 00:25:57,787
well, let's tell you what
our plan is for this business.

00:25:57,787 --> 00:26:01,607
We are looking at
a licensing play for bag bowl.

00:26:01,607 --> 00:26:03,637
Brian and I were considering
manufacturing it.

00:26:03,637 --> 00:26:04,957
When we looked
at all the resources

00:26:04,957 --> 00:26:06,987
that was going to take,
we thought,

00:26:06,987 --> 00:26:09,007
instead of shaking
one apple tree,

00:26:09,007 --> 00:26:11,757
why not lease out
the entire orchard?

00:26:11,757 --> 00:26:12,917
But isn't it a niche market?

00:26:12,917 --> 00:26:14,807
Because I have a bowl already
in my home, all right?

00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:18,607
So if I buy a bag of chips,
I pour them into the bowl.

00:26:18,607 --> 00:26:21,007
The chip company is not going to
increase its cost by 20 cents

00:26:21,007 --> 00:26:22,787
to provide one of these.

00:26:22,787 --> 00:26:24,957
They already sell their chips
and they're successful.
Mm.

00:26:24,957 --> 00:26:27,657
The guy who sells a bag of
anything is already selling it.

00:26:27,657 --> 00:26:29,837
He doesn't need to provide
the service

00:26:29,837 --> 00:26:31,817
to create a bowl for you.
Bowls are ubiquitous in homes.

00:26:31,817 --> 00:26:33,767
This is for tailgating,
maybe.

00:26:33,767 --> 00:26:35,767
I'm just not sure there's
a real demand for this.

00:26:35,767 --> 00:26:36,967
I don't know if you've seen,
though,

00:26:36,967 --> 00:26:39,607
where packaging is going
these days.

00:26:39,607 --> 00:26:42,667
Everybody's wanting to be able
to eat right out of the package

00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:44,617
that you're eating,
and right now

00:26:44,617 --> 00:26:46,667
it's not an elegant process
because...
and that is the problem...

00:26:46,667 --> 00:26:48,707
the top does not open up well.
Because you're pushing
the burden of the cost

00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:50,037
back on the manufacturer,
and that's a trend that is--

00:26:50,037 --> 00:26:51,817
They're not gonna like.
The cost does not--
We've talked--

00:26:51,817 --> 00:26:54,657
We've talked to gigantic plastic
packaging manufacturers

00:26:54,657 --> 00:26:55,987
in our homes--
and what did they say?

00:26:55,987 --> 00:26:58,007
2 cents to add this structure
to the bag. It's negligible.

00:26:58,007 --> 00:26:59,607
Listen, to the consumer goods
package business,

00:26:59,607 --> 00:27:00,737
2 cents is a lot.

00:27:00,737 --> 00:27:01,817
They hire people--
dozens of them--

00:27:01,817 --> 00:27:03,917
To cut costs
by 1/8th of a cent.

00:27:03,917 --> 00:27:06,737
But, I mean, look at the scale
of this business.

00:27:06,737 --> 00:27:09,787
Do you guys know
how many plastic bags

00:27:09,787 --> 00:27:12,007
are used in the country?
But what is to stop
somebody else

00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:13,707
from just doing this?

00:27:13,707 --> 00:27:17,787
We have a utility patent written
on the product, and, uh--

00:27:17,787 --> 00:27:20,057
you have a utility patent
already issued?

00:27:20,057 --> 00:27:21,717
No, we're
patent-pending still. Yeah.
It's pending.

00:27:21,717 --> 00:27:22,787
That doesn't mean
it'll ever issue.
Ah.

00:27:22,787 --> 00:27:25,017
What is the unique property,
though,

00:27:25,017 --> 00:27:27,637
to patent
of a circle of plastic?

00:27:27,637 --> 00:27:29,607
Um, well, as you know,

00:27:29,607 --> 00:27:32,007
sometimes, uh, the best,
most ingenious patents

00:27:32,007 --> 00:27:34,787
are sometimes
very simple innovations,

00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:37,017
like the post-It note or the end
of the shoelace things--

00:27:37,017 --> 00:27:40,587
Small things that in aggregate
make life a little bit easier.

00:27:40,587 --> 00:27:43,817
Our patent is designed to be
a structural...

00:27:43,817 --> 00:27:47,617
exoskeleton.
The exoskeleton for a plastic
bag to folds over the sides.

00:27:47,617 --> 00:27:48,707
I mean, I think you guys
are great,

00:27:48,707 --> 00:27:50,667
and I think this is
really clever.

00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:51,857
I just don't think
that you're gonna get

00:27:51,857 --> 00:27:53,707
any intellectual property
on it.

00:27:53,707 --> 00:27:55,987
Where do you sell this? Are you
currently selling this anywhere?

00:27:55,987 --> 00:27:58,967
We went to a trade show
in Chicago, the I.H.A. show,

00:27:58,967 --> 00:28:00,867
which is one of the biggest
housewares shows in the world.

00:28:00,867 --> 00:28:03,067
We know--we know what it is.
So everybody saw this?

00:28:03,067 --> 00:28:04,617
Everybody has seen this.

00:28:04,617 --> 00:28:05,787
Out of 2,000 booth spaces,

00:28:05,787 --> 00:28:07,737
we were one of 30 that received
a prestigious award

00:28:07,737 --> 00:28:09,607
called the design defined award.

00:28:09,607 --> 00:28:10,687
People loved it.

00:28:10,687 --> 00:28:12,887
The feedback was overwhelming
and tremendous.

00:28:12,887 --> 00:28:14,837
Once people saw us do the flip,

00:28:14,837 --> 00:28:16,007
everyone had that "Aha" Moment--
did you take orders?

00:28:16,007 --> 00:28:18,067
How many people--Yeah,
how many orders did you get?

00:28:18,067 --> 00:28:19,667
How many stores Wanted--

00:28:19,667 --> 00:28:20,957
Uh, we just took feedback
from that.

00:28:20,957 --> 00:28:22,807
We went to that show with
a proof of concept in mind.

00:28:22,807 --> 00:28:23,987
You did not get orders.
The answer's "None.

00:28:23,987 --> 00:28:25,667
But you won an award.

00:28:25,667 --> 00:28:26,757
So was that romancing the truth

00:28:26,757 --> 00:28:28,037
and just saying,
"No, we have no sales"?

00:28:28,037 --> 00:28:29,607
(chuckles)
Well,
we're a pre-Revenue startup.

00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:31,717
But, I mean, look at...
(laughter)

00:28:31,717 --> 00:28:33,737
The scale of this business.
So it's actually
dancing around the truth...

00:28:33,737 --> 00:28:35,767
yes. Yes.
Instead of saying,
"No, we have no sales."

00:28:35,767 --> 00:28:36,857
No, we're at the beginning.
We're at the beginning.

00:28:36,857 --> 00:28:38,617
It's a pre-Revenue startup.
Exactly!

00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:39,787
Hey, the guy's being honest
with you.
(mark laughing)

00:28:39,787 --> 00:28:40,887
Exactly.

00:28:40,887 --> 00:28:43,007
So it's pre-order,
pre-revenue...

00:28:43,007 --> 00:28:44,957
pre-patent.
Pre-does anybody want it?

00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:47,637
Pre-order, pre-patent,
pre-everything.

00:28:47,637 --> 00:28:49,657
Pre-calling somebody
to try to license it.

00:28:49,657 --> 00:28:51,867
Right.
It's completely virgin snow,

00:28:51,867 --> 00:28:53,887
and you guys are at
the top of the mountain,

00:28:53,887 --> 00:28:56,067
and we can ski powder
all the way down.

00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,837
You guys are slick, right?

00:28:57,837 --> 00:29:00,917
You found a niche. How big
it could be is debatable,

00:29:00,917 --> 00:29:02,587
but you guys are great
at debating it.

00:29:02,587 --> 00:29:04,707
But it's all about making
somebody else do the work.

00:29:04,707 --> 00:29:07,587
I see you guys
not as entrepreneurs

00:29:07,587 --> 00:29:08,907
But as want-repreneurs.

00:29:08,907 --> 00:29:09,937
Cubes, let me--
Let me jump in there.

00:29:09,937 --> 00:29:11,607
"Cubes"?

00:29:11,607 --> 00:29:14,707
Cubes? Just for calling me
"Cubes," I'm out.

00:29:16,767 --> 00:29:18,037
I'm calling him "Cubes"
From now on.

00:29:19,737 --> 00:29:21,807
We can get from "A" to "B,"
No doubt about it.

00:29:21,807 --> 00:29:23,707
But we are here
at the Shark Tank

00:29:23,707 --> 00:29:26,787
to get your access,
your expertise.

00:29:26,787 --> 00:29:29,687
You guys have no sales,
uh, no patent,

00:29:29,687 --> 00:29:32,687
no history, and you want us
to call on your behalf

00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,817
and you want our friends
to call us morons

00:29:34,817 --> 00:29:37,807
when we pitch all of what
you're saying to them. Right?

00:29:37,807 --> 00:29:39,007
Well, we are--

00:29:39,007 --> 00:29:40,957
We're not looking for you
to impugn your character.

00:29:40,957 --> 00:29:42,787
And if you think that
that's the kind of ridicule

00:29:42,787 --> 00:29:44,737
you would get
from your, you know,

00:29:44,737 --> 00:29:46,057
pitching this to other people,
then, you know,

00:29:46,057 --> 00:29:48,587
that would speak volumes
about the partnership

00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:49,837
we could have.
And there's the bottom line.

00:29:49,837 --> 00:29:51,737
So if I'm not running with it,
I'm running from it.

00:29:51,737 --> 00:29:53,787
But--
I'm out.

00:29:53,787 --> 00:29:54,957
I understand. Um...

00:29:54,957 --> 00:29:56,787
I ain't mad at ya.

00:29:56,787 --> 00:29:59,667
The greatest consumer
Innovations and products

00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:02,067
and success stories and profits
and wealth

00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:03,937
come from ideas that do
two things--

00:30:03,937 --> 00:30:05,737
Solve Problems
and reduce costs.

00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:07,707
Right.
This idea does neither.

00:30:07,707 --> 00:30:10,037
(Daymond) Mm-hmm.
So... I'm out.

00:30:10,037 --> 00:30:12,637
(mouths word)

00:30:15,807 --> 00:30:18,587
Look, Brian,
h-Here's where I'm at.

00:30:18,587 --> 00:30:19,767
Um...

00:30:19,767 --> 00:30:20,987
I think it's very clever.

00:30:20,987 --> 00:30:22,887
You know, I have little kids.
I think of the Tetra Pak.

00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:27,617
I think the person who invented
a square and easy way

00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:31,767
to drink juice boxes
made a lot of money

00:30:31,767 --> 00:30:32,967
from something that was
no different--

00:30:32,967 --> 00:30:34,917
Yeah, because it cut cost of
glass bottles, that's why.

00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:36,717
No, they made--Oh,
and they made it easier.

00:30:36,717 --> 00:30:39,607
I can see this selling.

00:30:39,607 --> 00:30:40,687
I'll make you an offer.

00:30:42,017 --> 00:30:45,057
I'll give you the $40,000
for 45%.

00:30:45,057 --> 00:30:46,987
I'll help you with getting
a couple companies

00:30:46,987 --> 00:30:48,707
to make a licensing deal.

00:30:48,707 --> 00:30:50,737
And I think I can help you
get it off the ground.

00:30:50,737 --> 00:30:52,967
Well, thank you. That, uh--

00:30:52,967 --> 00:30:54,757
so you're saying
this 3-Inch hula-hoop

00:30:54,757 --> 00:30:56,757
is worth $100,000 now,
the company?

00:30:56,757 --> 00:30:58,007
You know,
I think it's a great idea

00:30:58,007 --> 00:30:59,837
or It's not, but what I like
about it, Daymond, is we can...

00:30:59,837 --> 00:31:00,917
so you'll take--
It's a flier?

00:31:00,917 --> 00:31:02,667
You're gonna take a gamble
on it?

00:31:02,667 --> 00:31:03,957
Make a couple of calls and we
can find out very quickly.

00:31:03,957 --> 00:31:06,657
Can I get up and look?

00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:07,717
Absolutely.
Yeah, absolutely.

00:31:08,837 --> 00:31:09,967
Lori, are you interested?

00:31:09,967 --> 00:31:11,917
I'm looking.
Why should she not be, Daymond?

00:31:11,917 --> 00:31:14,767
She's attractive and she likes
attractive gentlemen.
(chuckles)

00:31:14,767 --> 00:31:16,017
Keep sucking up.

00:31:16,017 --> 00:31:17,807
So you just stick it down in...
yep.

00:31:17,807 --> 00:31:18,817
And you just go like this?

00:31:18,817 --> 00:31:19,907
Mm-hmm.

00:31:19,907 --> 00:31:20,987
When you fold this over
the side of it,

00:31:20,987 --> 00:31:22,967
it actually acts like
a-a ring around a barrel

00:31:22,967 --> 00:31:24,957
and helps give it stability.

00:31:24,957 --> 00:31:26,937
(Robert) Lori, how is it?
How--is it easy?

00:31:26,937 --> 00:31:28,617
It's easy.

00:31:28,617 --> 00:31:30,657
Thank you.

00:31:30,657 --> 00:31:32,607
Uncle Ben's has a 90-second rice

00:31:32,607 --> 00:31:35,617
that comes out of the microwave
in 90 seconds.

00:31:35,617 --> 00:31:37,837
It's a great product but imagine
the Uncle Ben's product

00:31:37,837 --> 00:31:39,737
being able to turn
into a bag itself

00:31:39,737 --> 00:31:42,967
as opposed to the headache
that you create

00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:44,057
pouring it into another bowl,
and then saying,

00:31:44,057 --> 00:31:45,807
"now I have to wash that bowl."

00:31:45,807 --> 00:31:47,937
I don't agree
with the licensing thing.

00:31:47,937 --> 00:31:51,687
I think that if you show this
off and try to get it licensed

00:31:51,687 --> 00:31:53,637
to a lot of companies,
they're just gonna knock it off.

00:31:53,637 --> 00:31:54,887
I don't think you're gonna
get the patent.

00:31:54,887 --> 00:31:56,967
But all that being said,

00:31:56,967 --> 00:31:59,787
I can get products made,
into market,

00:31:59,787 --> 00:32:01,607
and onto my show on QVC,

00:32:01,607 --> 00:32:03,917
and sell hundreds of thousands
of dollars within minutes.

00:32:03,917 --> 00:32:06,867
I think this is
a great tv item.

00:32:06,867 --> 00:32:08,707
Last season,
I took a guy who came in

00:32:08,707 --> 00:32:09,837
with a piece of steel
and a magnet,

00:32:09,837 --> 00:32:11,907
and we've now done
almost $3 million in sales

00:32:11,907 --> 00:32:14,687
in the last year.

00:32:14,687 --> 00:32:16,017
I think it's possible

00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,887
that we might be able to do some
Really big numbers with this.

00:32:18,887 --> 00:32:20,837
That being said,

00:32:20,837 --> 00:32:22,937
I will give you the $40,000

00:32:22,937 --> 00:32:27,007
for the 33% stake
in the company.

00:32:27,007 --> 00:32:29,007
What do you say?

00:32:29,007 --> 00:32:30,787
You're gonna give them exactly
what they asked for, right?

00:32:30,787 --> 00:32:32,717
I'm gonna give them exactly
what they asked for.

00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:33,967
Could we have a minute to...

00:32:33,967 --> 00:32:35,657
(Kevin and Robert
speak indistinctly)

00:32:35,657 --> 00:32:36,807
she gave you what you offered.
What are you gonna discuss?

00:32:36,807 --> 00:32:38,587
Yeah. Yeah, go have a minute.
See what happens.

00:32:38,587 --> 00:32:39,867
Wow.
You're taking a huge risk
by walking out the door.

00:32:39,867 --> 00:32:41,067
She gave you what
you asked for.

00:32:41,067 --> 00:32:43,057
Guys, you walk out of here,

00:32:43,057 --> 00:32:45,987
I'm pulling my offer.

00:32:45,987 --> 00:32:49,587
It's amazing that you would even
stop for a minute...

00:32:49,587 --> 00:32:50,667
no, we didn't--
no, I was just getting--
To think about it.

00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:51,857
We would love to do
the deal with you, Lori.

00:32:51,857 --> 00:32:53,017
Thank you.
Good.

00:32:53,017 --> 00:32:54,607
Great.

00:32:54,607 --> 00:32:55,767
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:57,737
It's so exciting.
Yeah, I'm very excited.

00:32:57,737 --> 00:32:58,857
Great. Great to be working
with you.
I think it'll be great.

00:32:58,857 --> 00:32:59,937
Thank you so much.
Great.

00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:01,017
Whoo!
(Mark) Whoo-Hoo!

00:33:01,017 --> 00:33:02,907
Talk to you soon.
Thank you, guys.

00:33:02,907 --> 00:33:04,967
Yeah! (laughs)

00:33:06,937 --> 00:33:09,657
(laughs)

00:33:09,657 --> 00:33:10,887
Whoo!

00:33:10,887 --> 00:33:12,657
Here's a little advice
for all the Mavericks players--

00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,037
don't call him "Cubes."
(laughs)

00:33:14,037 --> 00:33:15,907
The guy flips out.

00:33:15,907 --> 00:33:17,967
We chummed the water,
and, uh, it looks like

00:33:17,967 --> 00:33:20,807
we got a little bit nipped
in the leg a couple times.

00:33:20,807 --> 00:33:22,937
But in the end, we swam
right out of there with a deal,

00:33:22,937 --> 00:33:25,017
and we couldn't be
more stoked.

00:33:25,017 --> 00:33:27,787
♪♪♪

00:33:30,437 --> 00:33:34,200
♪♪♪

00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,200
Next is Henry Penix,

00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,320
with technology he hopes
to get in the hands

00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,550
of every household in America.

00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:52,934
Hi, sharks.

00:33:52,934 --> 00:33:55,674
My name is Henry penix,
and I'm the C.E.O. of Zomm.

00:33:55,674 --> 00:33:56,934
I'm asking for $2 million...

00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:58,024
Whoa.
Whoa.

00:33:58,024 --> 00:34:00,854
For 10% of my entire company.

00:34:00,854 --> 00:34:02,774
At Zomm, we create products
and services

00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:06,874
that revolutionize what people
do with their cell phones.

00:34:06,874 --> 00:34:08,804
And everyone has
a cell phone.

00:34:08,804 --> 00:34:12,054
Have any of you all ever left
your phones behind somewhere

00:34:12,054 --> 00:34:13,884
at a restaurant or bar or maybe
at home in the morning?

00:34:13,884 --> 00:34:15,724
I have, too.

00:34:15,724 --> 00:34:18,004
Well, when you put this
to your keychain

00:34:18,004 --> 00:34:19,834
and it separates
from your phone,

00:34:19,834 --> 00:34:21,004
it's gonna warn you that

00:34:21,004 --> 00:34:22,084
you've walked away
and left your phone behind.

00:34:22,084 --> 00:34:23,874
Let me show you how it works.

00:34:23,874 --> 00:34:26,674
Mark, you mind holding this?
Sure.

00:34:26,674 --> 00:34:29,074
Okay. All right, so say
you've--say you went home

00:34:29,074 --> 00:34:31,074
and you're rushing out
to the office, grab your keys

00:34:31,074 --> 00:34:33,774
'cause you gotta have your keys
to drive your car.

00:34:33,774 --> 00:34:34,954
When you get about
20 or 30 feet away,

00:34:34,954 --> 00:34:36,734
let me show you what happens.

00:34:36,734 --> 00:34:38,904
I'm gonna step over here.
You should feel a vibration.

00:34:38,904 --> 00:34:40,974
Yep. Sure do.
Yeah.

00:34:40,974 --> 00:34:42,804
And it'll light up.
You can see it light up.
Sure does.

00:34:42,804 --> 00:34:44,874
So if those two don't
get your attention,

00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:45,954
an alarm will start.

00:34:45,954 --> 00:34:47,624
(beeping gradually
increases volume)

00:34:47,624 --> 00:34:48,734
And then it'll start getting
louder and louder

00:34:48,734 --> 00:34:49,904
until you turn around...

00:34:49,904 --> 00:34:51,034
until I come get my phone.
And get your phone. Yeah. Yeah.

00:34:51,034 --> 00:34:52,854
So you can press the middle
button to turn it off.

00:34:52,854 --> 00:34:54,104
(beeping stops)
Everything's one-Button press.
Very simple.

00:34:54,104 --> 00:34:55,874
Very cool.
Uh-huh. Thank you.

00:34:55,874 --> 00:34:58,854
The second thing that it does--
you can find your keys with it.

00:34:58,854 --> 00:35:00,104
Let me do this.

00:35:00,104 --> 00:35:01,934
(beep)
Uh, Daymond, do you mind
to hang onto this?

00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:04,674
When I turn around,
pass it to somebody,

00:35:04,674 --> 00:35:05,974
and then I'll figure out
who took it.

00:35:07,834 --> 00:35:09,834
You got it?

00:35:09,834 --> 00:35:13,824
(pinging sound)

00:35:13,824 --> 00:35:15,624
I could tell by your eyes!
(laughs)

00:35:15,624 --> 00:35:17,624
(speaks indistinctly)
(Lori) Sounds like a submarine.
(laughs)

00:35:17,624 --> 00:35:19,684
The depth of the undertaker.
(pinging stops)

00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:21,684
So, um, the next thing
that it does--

00:35:21,684 --> 00:35:23,634
It's actually
an emergency dialer.

00:35:23,634 --> 00:35:24,974
You can program any number
in it.

00:35:24,974 --> 00:35:26,804
I've put my wife's number
in it.

00:35:26,804 --> 00:35:29,624
(phone rings)
(woman)
Hey, are you in trouble?

00:35:29,624 --> 00:35:31,674
I may be. I'm swimming
with sharks right now.

00:35:31,674 --> 00:35:33,934
All right,
talk to you later.

00:35:33,934 --> 00:35:35,824
So this is
the modern-day version

00:35:35,824 --> 00:35:37,654
of "I've fallen
and I can't get up!"

00:35:37,654 --> 00:35:39,704
Well, yeah. Yeah, it has
that aspect to it as well.

00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:40,934
We've had a lot of people
buy it for that.

00:35:40,934 --> 00:35:42,784
Well, I've seen this
in similar ways before.

00:35:42,784 --> 00:35:44,104
I've seen a dog collar

00:35:44,104 --> 00:35:46,704
Where if your pet goes too far,
your phone rings.

00:35:46,704 --> 00:35:47,874
Is it
all the elements combined

00:35:47,874 --> 00:35:50,084
that makes this so special
or worth $20 million? Or...

00:35:50,084 --> 00:35:52,834
it is. Yeah, we've got patents
all over the world,

00:35:52,834 --> 00:35:55,724
uh, won innovation awards
the last three years.

00:35:55,724 --> 00:35:58,974
So tell us about your sales,
your costs, your margins,

00:35:58,974 --> 00:36:00,104
what it's being sold for,
et cetera.

00:36:00,104 --> 00:36:02,754
When we first came out with it
in late 2010,

00:36:02,754 --> 00:36:04,984
we did about $750,000
in sales.

00:36:04,984 --> 00:36:06,884
What were your sales in 2011?

00:36:06,884 --> 00:36:08,034
We did right at $5 million.

00:36:08,034 --> 00:36:09,724
(Kevin) Ah.
Whoa.

00:36:09,724 --> 00:36:10,804
Good growth.

00:36:10,804 --> 00:36:12,054
And what are you on track for
this year?

00:36:12,054 --> 00:36:13,834
Uh, about $7.2 million.

00:36:13,834 --> 00:36:15,674
Nice.

00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,784
And will you net
when you do $7.2 million?

00:36:17,784 --> 00:36:19,984
Yeah, I'm glad you asked.
Me, too.

00:36:19,984 --> 00:36:21,824
This is the exciting part.
(chuckles)

00:36:21,824 --> 00:36:24,624
We will net, uh,
right at $2 million,

00:36:24,624 --> 00:36:25,704
after--

00:36:25,704 --> 00:36:26,854
This is after all of your costs,
paying yourself,

00:36:26,854 --> 00:36:28,834
all your employees?
Yes.

00:36:28,834 --> 00:36:30,754
Are you gonna spend
that $2 million also,

00:36:30,754 --> 00:36:33,084
put it back in the business?
Because you basically have

00:36:33,084 --> 00:36:34,734
the $2 million
you're asking for.

00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:37,004
I've never taken a salary
from the company.

00:36:37,004 --> 00:36:38,934
Uh, I've actually put money
in the company myself.

00:36:38,934 --> 00:36:40,774
Uh--
how much?

00:36:40,774 --> 00:36:43,774
Uh, I put in, um,
right at $4 million.

00:36:43,774 --> 00:36:46,104
(Robert and Daymond)
Of your own money?

00:36:46,104 --> 00:36:48,074
Yeah. Yeah.
(Kevin) And how much
do you own of it?

00:36:48,074 --> 00:36:49,854
Well, you'd get
that money from?

00:36:49,854 --> 00:36:52,724
I, uh, in 2000,
I sold a business

00:36:52,724 --> 00:36:54,854
that my wife and I
had built.

00:36:54,854 --> 00:36:56,684
We built it from zero
to about 300 employees,

00:36:56,684 --> 00:36:58,024
and we were able to exit--
what kind of business?

00:36:58,024 --> 00:36:59,854
Uh, it was, uh,
early learning centers.

00:36:59,854 --> 00:37:01,634
Do you own the company yourself?

00:37:01,634 --> 00:37:02,724
I do.
(Kevin) 100%?

00:37:02,724 --> 00:37:03,804
(Lori) With no partners?

00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,074
100%?
No, no.

00:37:05,074 --> 00:37:08,734
We've got one other investor.
They're in at, uh, 17%.

00:37:08,734 --> 00:37:09,984
And how much did they put in?

00:37:09,984 --> 00:37:10,984
$5 million.

00:37:10,984 --> 00:37:12,734
(Kevin) Whoa.

00:37:12,734 --> 00:37:15,754
So this is a down round for you,
basically?

00:37:17,624 --> 00:37:18,704
Excuse me?

00:37:18,704 --> 00:37:19,784
A "down round" meaning
$5 million for 17%

00:37:19,784 --> 00:37:21,934
values the company
at about $30 million.

00:37:21,934 --> 00:37:23,784
Yeah, why are you going down?

00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:25,754
Because we need the cash
right now.

00:37:25,754 --> 00:37:27,084
Hang on. You put in $4 million
of your own.

00:37:27,084 --> 00:37:29,774
You go out,
you raise another $5 million,

00:37:29,774 --> 00:37:32,934
giving the company
about a $30 million value.

00:37:32,934 --> 00:37:34,854
Your numbers are on fire,

00:37:34,854 --> 00:37:36,754
fantastic growth.

00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,654
And you're running out of cash?

00:37:38,654 --> 00:37:39,804
Yeah.

00:37:39,804 --> 00:37:42,034
(Lori) Why are you running out
of cash?

00:37:42,034 --> 00:37:43,784
Something smells
a little funny here.

00:37:43,784 --> 00:37:45,674
The other part is we actually
developed another product.

00:37:45,674 --> 00:37:48,004
Ah!

00:37:48,004 --> 00:37:49,924
We've developed
a product that

00:37:49,924 --> 00:37:52,674
we won three innovation awards
just this past January.

00:37:52,674 --> 00:37:54,854
And it's not this?
No.

00:37:54,854 --> 00:37:55,934
It's called
Lifestyle Connect,

00:37:55,934 --> 00:37:57,834
and it does everything
that this does

00:37:57,834 --> 00:38:00,074
but it will monitor--like,
low energy heart rate monitors,

00:38:00,074 --> 00:38:02,824
blood glucose monitors,
and fall detectors.

00:38:02,824 --> 00:38:05,684
But let me ask. You--
(Robert) But, Henry, you--
You've raised $9 million,

00:38:05,684 --> 00:38:07,954
how do you burn through
$9 million in...

00:38:07,954 --> 00:38:09,934
two years?

00:38:09,934 --> 00:38:12,974
Can you explain that to me?

00:38:15,004 --> 00:38:17,774
♪♪♪

00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:24,204
You've raised $9 million.

00:38:24,204 --> 00:38:26,574
How do you burn through
$9 million in...

00:38:26,574 --> 00:38:28,574
two years?

00:38:28,574 --> 00:38:31,474
Can you explain that to me?

00:38:31,474 --> 00:38:33,404
We've got some inventory
as well.

00:38:33,404 --> 00:38:35,234
(Kevin) How much inventory?
How much you have in inventory?

00:38:35,234 --> 00:38:36,374
We've got close to $2 million
in inventory.

00:38:38,354 --> 00:38:40,184
The numbers
just don't add up for me.

00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:44,304
They don't add up because
if your sales are that strong,

00:38:44,304 --> 00:38:47,154
you shouldn't be holding
$2 million in inventory.

00:38:47,154 --> 00:38:48,474
Exactly.

00:38:48,474 --> 00:38:50,134
We built, last year,

00:38:50,134 --> 00:38:51,254
a little too much
for the Christmas season,

00:38:51,254 --> 00:38:52,584
and we didn't sell through
all of them.

00:38:52,584 --> 00:38:56,184
So what's happening now--You
guys tell me if I'm wrong here--

00:38:56,184 --> 00:38:58,154
You got too excited
during the Christmas season,

00:38:58,154 --> 00:38:59,524
you built too many.

00:38:59,524 --> 00:39:02,554
Now you've got this big crush
of inventory,

00:39:02,554 --> 00:39:07,134
and you think your solution is
to go out and raise $2 million

00:39:07,134 --> 00:39:09,284
so you can get out
from underneath your inventory

00:39:09,284 --> 00:39:11,174
and get to your new product.

00:39:12,534 --> 00:39:15,154
Continue this product and...

00:39:15,154 --> 00:39:16,454
(Daymond)
but wait, wait, wait.

00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:18,124
We'll--We'll decide if we want
to bring the new product.

00:39:18,124 --> 00:39:19,284
But wait, there's more.
I'm like a bloodhound.

00:39:19,284 --> 00:39:20,534
Let me--Let me ask you
something.

00:39:20,534 --> 00:39:23,384
How much did you spend on R&amp;D--
Research and development?

00:39:23,384 --> 00:39:26,174
All the money that we've
ever invested in the company

00:39:26,174 --> 00:39:27,304
we've put back
into the company.

00:39:27,304 --> 00:39:28,384
I didn't get the answer.

00:39:28,384 --> 00:39:30,184
Just, how much do you think
you spend in R&amp;D

00:39:30,184 --> 00:39:31,354
over the last three years?

00:39:31,354 --> 00:39:33,474
I don't know
the exact number.

00:39:33,474 --> 00:39:37,274
Would you say that you spent
about a million... or more?

00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:39,184
I really don't know
the exact number.

00:39:39,184 --> 00:39:41,404
You can--You had $9 million.
You gotta know where it went.

00:39:41,404 --> 00:39:43,404
Yeah, you should--I mean,
a million between friends...
you gotta know.

00:39:43,404 --> 00:39:47,124
I get it. But... under a million
or over a million?

00:39:47,124 --> 00:39:49,434
I would say over.
(Mark and Daymond) Okay.

00:39:49,434 --> 00:39:52,534
(Mark) When you got started,
did you go through the approach

00:39:52,534 --> 00:39:55,184
of go and hire
some marketing M.D.A.S,

00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:56,524
put together
a marketing program?

00:39:56,524 --> 00:39:58,354
Marketing guys, sales guys.

00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,204
And you raised
all this money

00:40:00,204 --> 00:40:02,324
because it was go big
or go home?

00:40:02,324 --> 00:40:04,304
Yeah. Yeah, we--
and you guys wanted
to hit the home run,

00:40:04,304 --> 00:40:06,324
and you got a triple...
(laughs)

00:40:06,324 --> 00:40:08,284
Yeah. Yeah.
But now you're stuck.

00:40:08,284 --> 00:40:10,254
Steve jobs had a dream.

00:40:10,254 --> 00:40:12,224
He wanted a computer
on every desktop.

00:40:12,224 --> 00:40:14,404
And my dream is to have a Zomm
or a Zomm product

00:40:14,404 --> 00:40:15,484
with every cell phone.

00:40:15,484 --> 00:40:17,134
And your dream is killing you.

00:40:18,504 --> 00:40:22,124
You went too big
and tried to hit a home run

00:40:22,124 --> 00:40:23,454
when a single would
win the game.

00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:25,284
Yeah.

00:40:25,284 --> 00:40:26,434
And that's why I'm out.

00:40:26,434 --> 00:40:28,274
You sure?

00:40:28,274 --> 00:40:30,204
I'm positive.

00:40:31,574 --> 00:40:34,324
You've done two things
most people have never done

00:40:34,324 --> 00:40:35,484
that get in front of us.

00:40:35,484 --> 00:40:37,434
You've raised $9 million

00:40:37,434 --> 00:40:39,484
and you've done $5 million
in sales,

00:40:39,484 --> 00:40:42,384
and your company is basically
about to die,

00:40:42,384 --> 00:40:44,484
and you don't even know it.

00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:48,184
I gotta tell ya, I wouldn't give
you $2 million of my own money.

00:40:48,184 --> 00:40:51,154
I'm out.

00:40:52,524 --> 00:40:56,274
I have to take my hat off to
you, creating a great business.

00:40:56,274 --> 00:40:59,524
But I think that
if I go into your books,

00:40:59,524 --> 00:41:01,434
it's gonna be horrific.

00:41:01,434 --> 00:41:03,124
I'm out.

00:41:03,124 --> 00:41:04,304
Okay. Thank you.

00:41:04,304 --> 00:41:05,384
Lori?

00:41:05,384 --> 00:41:07,124
Yeah?
Mr. Wonderful?

00:41:07,124 --> 00:41:08,534
I think what you've done
is brilliant.

00:41:08,534 --> 00:41:10,284
I think it's a great product.

00:41:10,284 --> 00:41:13,454
Problem for me is that
where you are right now,

00:41:13,454 --> 00:41:15,384
needing to ask us for money,

00:41:15,384 --> 00:41:17,454
it tells me something's wrong.

00:41:17,454 --> 00:41:19,504
And for that reason, I'm out.

00:41:23,124 --> 00:41:25,534
Okay, Henry, I'm the last shark
still looking at this.

00:41:25,534 --> 00:41:29,304
What intrigues me are sales,
and you have them.

00:41:32,404 --> 00:41:35,454
But... I don't think I'm gonna
give you $2 million.

00:41:37,434 --> 00:41:39,584
All I care about is when
I part with my money

00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:42,484
and send it off to summer camp
to go and train

00:41:42,484 --> 00:41:45,554
and learn a new skill, is that
it comes back in September

00:41:45,554 --> 00:41:47,604
with a lot more muscles.

00:41:47,604 --> 00:41:50,234
I'm scared
you'll kill my money.

00:41:51,604 --> 00:41:53,434
I won't kill your money.

00:41:53,434 --> 00:41:55,484
You've killed a lot of money
before mine.

00:41:55,484 --> 00:41:57,504
Take--Take the majority
of the board seats.

00:41:57,504 --> 00:41:59,604
I don't want to take control.
I really don't.
Let's--Let's figure it out.

00:41:59,604 --> 00:42:02,154
Although--although you could
use me, believe me.

00:42:02,154 --> 00:42:04,524
I could fix you in--in
darwinian ways you don't know,

00:42:04,524 --> 00:42:07,554
but you may not find that
a pleasant experience.

00:42:09,354 --> 00:42:11,284
I'm out.

00:42:15,124 --> 00:42:16,404
Good luck.
Okay. All right,
thank you very much.

00:42:16,404 --> 00:42:18,204
Bye-Bye.

00:42:20,474 --> 00:42:21,554
(Mark) He just went big.

00:42:21,554 --> 00:42:23,224
If he were to come
into the Shark Tank

00:42:23,224 --> 00:42:25,354
the day he started and said,

00:42:25,354 --> 00:42:30,234
"Guys, I need help. I want
$250,000 for 25% of my company,"

00:42:30,234 --> 00:42:31,374
We'd have been all over it.

00:42:31,374 --> 00:42:32,584
(Robert)
You know, it's a shame there.

00:42:32,584 --> 00:42:34,554
(Lori) It's a great product.
That was a great product.
