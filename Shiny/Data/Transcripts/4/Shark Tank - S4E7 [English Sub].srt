00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,410
(man) The sharks are back

00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,683
in an all-new season
of "Shark Tank,"

00:00:03,683 --> 00:00:07,030
where hopeful entrepreneurs
from across the country

00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,860
dream of a chance
to secure an investment

00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,660
and gain powerful partners

00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,950
to start, grow,
or save their business.

00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,080
If the sharks hear
a great idea...

00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,780
we're gonna be
in 3,000 stores.

00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,410
Keep going. Keep going.

00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,610
They're ready to invest,
using their own money.

00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:27,000
My offer is $100,000...
for 30%.

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,030
And they'll fight each other
for a piece of the action.

00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,030
I'm willing to give you
$175,000.

00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,000
(Kevin) WHOA!
Mine just went to $200,000.

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,683
(Kevin and Robert) Whoa!

00:00:34,683 --> 00:00:37,680
But first, the entrepreneurs
must convince a shark

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,360
to invest the full amount
they're asking for,

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,700
or they'll walk away
with nothing.

00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,500
It doesn't sell on a shelf--
Correct.

00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,697
That's not good.
I don't want to
tear you to pieces on this,

00:00:46,697 --> 00:00:48,700
but I may have to.

00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,110
We do have

00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,110
the most advanced
ebyte controller on the market.

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,780
Whoa! Whoa!

00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,080
That's a disaster
waiting to happen.

00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,500
It's sink or swim.

00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,860
I'll make you a millionaire
within a year.

00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,330
(sighs) I can't believe
I'm gonna say this.

00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,080
Who are the sharks?

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,910
They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors

00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:12,280
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.

00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,410
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist

00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:20,280
who turned a $10,000 loan
into a software business

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,000
worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,500
Lori Greiner,
the queen of QVC,

00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,250
holds over a hundred patents

00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,530
and has launched
over 300 products,

00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,280
grossing over
a half a billion dollars

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,750
in retail sales.

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,860
Daymond John is a fashion mogul
and branding expert

00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,250
Who grew his homemade
clothing line

00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:43,000
into the globally recognized
fashion brand Fubu.

00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,950
Robert Herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,

00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,000
is now a technology mogul

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,910
who sold his first
internet companies

00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:53,530
for over $350 million.

00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,410
And Mark Cuban,

00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,830
notorious billionaire
entrepreneur

00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:13,580
and the outspoken owner
of the Dallas Mavericks.

00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,330
First into the Shark Tank
is Aaron Krause,

00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,697
who believes his product will
make every day cleaning easier.

00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,250
Hi, sharks. I'm Aaron Krause
from Philadelphia,

00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,610
and I'm known as the daddy
of the Scrub Daddy,

00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,780
the cutest but most high tech
scrubbing tool in the world.

00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,860
Today, I'm seeking
a $100,000 investment

00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,110
in exchange for 10% equity
in the Scrub Daddy business.

00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,830
It's the greatest
kitchen scrubbing tool

00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,160
you ever used,

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,530
because Scrub Daddy
completely changes its texture

00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,410
by just adjusting
your water temperature.

00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,780
Let me show you
how that works.

00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,750
Here I've got some hot water.
Here I've got some cold water.

00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,330
When I immerse the scrub daddies
in the hot and cold water,

00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,700
a complete transformation
occurs.

00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,700
Now to show you that,
I've got 10-pound weights.

00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,750
Here, under the 10 pounds,
it's soft and compressible,

00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,692
and that's like a sponge.

00:03:00,692 --> 00:03:02,860
That's for your gentle
scrubbing application.

00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,610
But here...

00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:05,830
check that out.

00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,500
It's hard and firm.

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,683
That's gonna be for heavy-Duty
scrubbing applications.

00:03:08,683 --> 00:03:11,280
We burned on brown gravy,
tomato sauce,

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:11,688
cheese, and mustard

00:03:11,688 --> 00:03:14,780
onto a glass stovetop
and a stainless steel pan.

00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,688
I'm gonna take the Scrub Daddy,
and you're gonna see...

00:03:15,688 --> 00:03:18,500
(scrubbing)
It's just gonna attack

00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,280
right into that burned-on mess,
scrubbing it right off.

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,410
And remember,
I'm just using water here.

00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,910
There's no chemicals at all.

00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,200
And it's gonna cut
right through that.

00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,680
It won't scratch
any of your surfaces

00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,683
but it will clean them
beautifully.

00:03:30,683 --> 00:03:33,700
Now Scrub Daddy's
not really smiling anymore,

00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,680
so I'm gonna put him here
in the warm water.

00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,660
And in just
a couple seconds...

00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,530
voila.

00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,200
He's back to bright, fresh,
and clean every time.

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,280
Sharks, that's not just
another smiling face.

00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,830
You put it on your hand,
you can get to the bottom

00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,500
and clean the sides
in one move.

00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,200
And that smiling mouth,

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,700
that cleans spoons, knives,
forks, spatulas,

00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,450
even large serving spoons
on both sides

00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,780
at the same time.

00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,947
Sharks, with your help,

00:04:02,947 --> 00:04:04,727
Scrub Daddy will
be scrubbing and smiling

00:04:04,727 --> 00:04:06,617
in every kitchen
in the world.

00:04:06,617 --> 00:04:08,777
Whoo!
(Daymond and Lori) Wow!

00:04:08,777 --> 00:04:11,314
Scrub Daddy!
I've never witnessed
a live infomercial.

00:04:11,314 --> 00:04:13,527
That was fantastic.

00:04:13,527 --> 00:04:16,100
That was incredible.
Do you have samples?

00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,068
I do.

00:04:19,068 --> 00:04:20,734
(Lori) Where are you
selling this now?
Thank you.

00:04:20,734 --> 00:04:22,814
Well, currently we have it
in five supermarkets

00:04:22,814 --> 00:04:23,334
in the Philadelphia area.

00:04:23,334 --> 00:04:25,346
We also sell it
on our web site.
Thank you.

00:04:25,346 --> 00:04:29,984
I've been on QVC three times
over about three months.

00:04:29,984 --> 00:04:30,351
(Robert) And how'd it go?

00:04:30,351 --> 00:04:34,184
Fantastic. They've invited me
back over and over.

00:04:34,184 --> 00:04:35,400
And every time I go on,

00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,180
they reorder 30% more
than the last time.

00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,003
So Scrub Daddy is hummin'.

00:04:39,003 --> 00:04:41,850
(Robert) And what were your
total sales--QVC, wholesale?

00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,180
Just north of $100,000,

00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,520
only in four months.

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,003
Do you have a patent on this?

00:04:46,003 --> 00:04:49,270
I actually have a patent.
I have two more pending.

00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,570
We have the trademark.
We have domain name.

00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,070
Okay, Aaron, what do you need
the $100,000 for?

00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,430
What I wanna do is set up

00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,270
an independent
manufacturing facility

00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,650
with automated equipment.

00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,930
Why do you need to go
into your own facility?

00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,150
The biggest problem is,
I'm on their time schedule.

00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,003
Are you saying that you could
be making more revenue

00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:07,020
if you're 24/7 making
scrub daddies?

00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,320
The way QVC's going
and we're just about to launch

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,850
in a whole bunch of stores,
we're gonna need that capacity.

00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,900
And I have 18 years experience
running a manufacturing plant

00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,433
that runs 24 hours a day.

00:05:17,433 --> 00:05:19,296
I know exactly what
I need to do

00:05:19,296 --> 00:05:20,596
to make this thing
really efficient,

00:05:20,596 --> 00:05:21,043
and I'm looking to add
a strategic partner

00:05:21,043 --> 00:05:24,626
who can open this up
into the retail stores.

00:05:24,626 --> 00:05:27,096
I'm only in five supermarkets.
That's it.

00:05:27,096 --> 00:05:28,756
What's your cost?

00:05:28,756 --> 00:05:29,796
The cost to make one's
about a dollar.

00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,456
What are you selling 'em for?

00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,029
About $2.80.

00:05:32,029 --> 00:05:33,926
Wholesale?
Wholesale.

00:05:33,926 --> 00:05:36,046
This needs to be
in every supermarket,

00:05:36,046 --> 00:05:38,096
drug store, Walgreens, CVS.

00:05:38,096 --> 00:05:40,176
(Kevin) It's so expensive.

00:05:40,176 --> 00:05:41,796
Mrs. Schlubinski goes
to the store

00:05:41,796 --> 00:05:43,456
and picks this off the shelf
and says,

00:05:43,456 --> 00:05:45,596
"Hey, it's a piece of foam
with a Smiley face on it.

00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:47,096
It costs 2 cents to make
in China."

00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,596
That's what she's thinking.

00:05:48,596 --> 00:05:50,596
'cause a brillo pad,
which is traditional product,

00:05:50,596 --> 00:05:53,633
is what... a 20%--
You're comparing it to

00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:55,233
the lowest end
of the lowest end.

00:05:55,233 --> 00:05:56,533
You take it up to
the highest end,

00:05:56,533 --> 00:05:58,145
talk about the--the ones
like dobie pads

00:05:58,145 --> 00:06:01,203
or other pads out there
that are, you know, brand-name.

00:06:01,203 --> 00:06:03,953
Scrub Daddy, I-I think
you've done a great job today,

00:06:03,953 --> 00:06:05,903
but I don't know if it's
gonna work in retail.

00:06:05,903 --> 00:06:07,363
I don't--I don't buy in
for that vision.

00:06:09,113 --> 00:06:10,953
Just in the packaging,

00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,983
I just don't know if I see
the difference.
Robert, I--

00:06:12,983 --> 00:06:15,203
it doesn't sell on a shelf--
Correct.

00:06:15,203 --> 00:06:17,113
But if you put it
in display shippers

00:06:17,113 --> 00:06:18,283
which we've built--

00:06:18,283 --> 00:06:19,903
These beautiful
cardboard display shippers--

00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,613
and it communicates the message
to every one of the customers.

00:06:21,613 --> 00:06:23,313
It sits on the end cabin.

00:06:23,313 --> 00:06:24,150
You're gonna have to pay
for those things.

00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,145
Well...
it's hard to get them,

00:06:26,145 --> 00:06:28,653
even if you pay for them.

00:06:28,653 --> 00:06:31,363
Great job today, but I-I don't
see the retail vision.

00:06:31,363 --> 00:06:32,813
I'm out.

00:06:34,141 --> 00:06:37,063
I understand.

00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,733
I like the product.

00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:40,113
I think you're--You're doing
great things.

00:06:40,113 --> 00:06:41,145
You're doing this
the exact right way.

00:06:41,145 --> 00:06:45,903
But when I hear "QVC"--
no disrespect to Lori--

00:06:45,903 --> 00:06:48,153
When the company's sales are
completely dependent on QVC,

00:06:48,153 --> 00:06:50,136
that's a disaster
waiting to happen.

00:06:50,136 --> 00:06:54,453
Well, I-I've got 3,000 stores
lined up right now.

00:06:54,453 --> 00:06:57,363
We're gonna be
in 3,000 stores.

00:06:57,363 --> 00:06:58,783
I understand, but even...

00:06:58,783 --> 00:06:59,136
Okay, put aside QVC.

00:06:59,136 --> 00:07:01,483
You're still
a 1-product company.

00:07:01,483 --> 00:07:03,203
Right?
Not for long.

00:07:03,203 --> 00:07:04,613
We've got Scrub Mommy.

00:07:04,613 --> 00:07:05,150
We've got Scrub Baby
for doing baby bottles.

00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,703
I've got a holder
that sits it on your sink

00:07:07,703 --> 00:07:09,813
and it's got drains
in the legs.

00:07:09,813 --> 00:07:11,313
You don't understand
who you're dealing with.

00:07:11,313 --> 00:07:12,533
(sharks laugh)
I am--I am the...

00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:14,563
I'm not doubting
the scrub market.

00:07:14,563 --> 00:07:16,733
I'm not doubting
you are the Scrub Daddy,

00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:19,983
but I'm not a scrub pimp,
so I'm out.

00:07:19,983 --> 00:07:22,703
That hurts, Mark.

00:07:22,703 --> 00:07:24,233
I wanted to work with you
so bad.

00:07:24,233 --> 00:07:27,313
Mark, QVC does
over $8 billion in sales a year,

00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:29,703
and I've done
over $500 million myself.

00:07:29,703 --> 00:07:31,150
Yes, you have, and you rotate
product in and out of there,

00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,136
and once those products are out,
they're out.

00:07:34,136 --> 00:07:36,136
How about this deal?

00:07:36,136 --> 00:07:40,033

Let's start the bidding
there.

00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:52,983
All right, you're out.

00:07:54,653 --> 00:07:56,333
You know, I'm somebody
who could paint any picture,

00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:59,700
and I think that Lori is
a vicious, back-stabbing shark.

00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,353
That's all true.

00:08:01,353 --> 00:08:04,250
But sometimes
I love her as well,

00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,350

the QVC queen.

No offense, Daymond.
I don't need you.

You don't.

00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,700
I will get you into
infomercial right away,

00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,120
and I'm pretty confident

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,730
that we could get this
into all retail stores

00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,070
across the country

(Kevin) I'll tell you what
I'll do for you.

00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,980
I'll give you $100,000.

00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,280
We'll never agree
on what percentage I should get,

00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,480
so I'm gonna change the model
completely.

00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,900
You're gonna keep
the whole company.

00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,530
But I wanna be
your financier.

00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,030
I want you to give me

00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,950
50 cents on every unit sold
until I get the 100k back.

00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:47,450
Then it drops to 10 cents
in perpetuity.

00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,230
(Mark) You just less increased
your cost of goods sold by 50%.

00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,450
Nothing, right?

00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,400
Why give up 30% of your company?

00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,700
(Daymond) just to sweeten
the pot a little bit,

00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,030

00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,900
The experience, the connections,
everything that I have...

00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,230
It will be successful.

00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,870
I am partnered

of Scrub Daddy?

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,650
Think of the relationship
you have with this sponge.

00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,870
(laughs)
You're selling this thing out,

00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,730
and it's gonna cry.
It won't be happy anymore.

(Daymond)
We've heard that already.

Tonight, I want the answer
to one question, all right?

00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:51,780
Do you think 25% of the equity
in your company

00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:56,320
is worth more or less THAN
10 cents a unit in perpetuity?

00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,870
This is--
(Lori) and he's all talk.
Where's he gonna take you?

00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,950
It doesn't matter. Ask--
It does matter!

00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,700
Connections are everything in--
'cause you can take--
You can take--

00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,150
You keep 25% of this business,

00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,150
which may sell
10 million of these,

00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,150
and you keep it
all for yourself.

00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,780
(Lori) but you're gonna
be keeping nothing

00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,950
because he doesn't know how
to get this out there...

00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,370
you mean,
"you haven't had any success."
Fast and market it correctly.

00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,620
"you're an idiot.
You don't know what to do."

00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,700
I know what to do.
Exactly!

00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,900
(Daymond) I just did

00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,070

00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:22,120
Half a billion.

00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,200
So I understand retail.
But that doesn't mean anything.
What product is it?

00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,450

You keep all the equity.

Lori is offering you

00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,200
$100,000 for 25%.

00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,320
I offered $150,000
last time.

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,070
Whoa! Hang on!
I-I didn't hear that.

00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,370

down to 25 cents,

is recovered,

00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,400

Um, the equity amount
is--Is too much.

Would you consider
coming down to 20%?

You know what? I will.

00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,400

00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,480
expanding the product line.

00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,620
I mean, this is gonna be
a multimillion-dollar company

00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,820
very soon.

00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,900
♪♪♪

00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,820
♪♪♪

00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,120
Here's a good boy.
That's so good.

00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,650
Let me get
your paw through.

00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,950
I'm Meg...
and I'm Matt.

00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,400
And we live
in Denver, Colorado,

00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,400
with our family.

00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,730
Let's go.

00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,280
(barks)

00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,730
Give me a high five.

00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,820
We call Quimby "the bear"

00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,780
Because he growls
like a bear.

00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,870
(growls)

00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,370
And we call Laika
"the rat,"

00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,820
because he has
an unfortunate name.

00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,280
He's a rat terrier.

00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,900
(Matt) Come on, guys.
Let's go outside.

00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,820
(thud)
(laughs)

00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,030
We don't have children yet,

00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,030
so the bear and the rat

00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,570
are very much
like our children.

00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:15,980
We do everything
with them.

00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,150
We go on walks, we take
them on car rides,

00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,820
eat with them,
sleep with them.

00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,870
They're a huge inspiration

00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,570
for why we started
our company.

00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,200
After sharing
a treat with our dogs,

00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,370
we noticed that they would
usually get sick.

00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:29,530
So we wanted to make something
that was not only fun

00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,150
but beneficial
to their digestion, as well.

00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:33,980
And unlike anything
that's on the market.

00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,820
Who wants treats?
Come here!

00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,570
There's a huge market
of pet lovers

00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,950
looking for the best
for their best friends with fur.

00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,700
Is that good stuff?
Is that delicious?

00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,480
We know we have
an awesome product

00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,980
that millions of dog Lovers

00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,320
would love to get
their hands on,

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,700
and we need the sharks' help

00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,120
to get it out there
to those people.

00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,200
Oh. Ho ho ho ho ho! Aw!

00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,780
Aw.

00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,150
That is the cutest dog
I've ever seen.

00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,370
Why is it every dog

00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:08,980
is the cutest dog
you've ever seen, Robert?

00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,370
Hi, my name
is Meg Meyer,

00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:11,870
and this is
my husband Matt.

00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:14,070
And this is Quimby,
a.K.A. "the bear,"

00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:16,150
and Laika,
a.K.A. "the rat."

00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:19,780
And we are the bear &amp; the rat
cool treats for dogs.

00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,070
We're seeking $125,000

00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:25,700
in exchange for 20% equity
in our company.

00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,650
Ice cream is not usually good
for dogs.

00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,900
It upsets their stomach,

00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,650
and the milk and sugar
is too rich for them.

00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:31,980
I wanted to come up
with a treat

00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,820
that was not only beneficial
to their digestion,

00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,120
it actually supported
their immune system.

00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,950
People are forming very special,
strong bonds with their animals.

00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,200
I've had the bear
for 14 years.

00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,150
So if I'm enjoying
an ice cream treat,

00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,320
he's gonna enjoy
an ice cream treat.

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,900
Dogs love our fro-Yo.

00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,980
But don't take our word
for it.

00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,900
Take their word for it.

00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,820
(chuckles) Our introductory line
comes in Three awesome flavors--

00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,900
(laughing)
We have our
bacon peanut barker,

00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,700
our banana peanut barker,

00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,870
and our choc 'o' not.

00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:01,870
Now more than ever,

00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:04,280
consumers are looking
for natural,

00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,780
healthful treats
for their dogs.

00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,200
We're certain that
an investment from the sharks

00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,820
would not only strengthen
our business financially,

00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,780
but we're also super-excited
about the expertise

00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,780
you would bring to the company

00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,870
to make the bear &amp; rat
unstoppable.

00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,530
Now who has questions?

00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,900
I have a question, Meg.

00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,320
I'm sure you do.
(laughter)

00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,870
Uh-Oh. Get--Get ready.
No, no. I'm being pragmatic.

00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,570
The money.
You're building a brand
around the bear and the rat.

00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,030
Yes.
The bear is 14.

00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:30,230
He is.
He's gonna be snuff city
in 24 months.

00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:33,450
Do you have
another bear backup?

00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,980
We--we love the bear.

00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,530
It'll be part
of our story,

00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,320
and part of his legacy,

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,320
and--and we'll
figure that out.

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,370
So it's like ice cream?
It--It's...

00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:43,870
it is human grade.
So would you like to try it?

00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,120
No.

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,450
(laughter)

00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,870
bacon peanut?
That's our carob flavor.
That's fat-Free.

00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,730
Banana? You think
I should go bananas?

00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:52,730
I think you
should go banana.

00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,200
(laughter)

00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,780
Perfect.

00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,820
So they have
no added sugar whatsoever.
(chuckles) don't do it.

00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,870
Don't do it. Don't.
So it's not like ice cream
that you're gonna expect.

00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,200
It's Bland,

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,200
but it's just enough flavor
to get their tail wagging.

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,280
Come on. It's not that bad.

00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,730
It has natural
banana sugar in there.

00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,730
Oh, my god.
(laughs)

00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,030
Oh, he tried the bacon!

00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,530
(laughter)

00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,400
Was it good?
Ohh!

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,530
That was awful.

00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,370
So guys, let me get
down to this.
Yes.

00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,700
You know, I'm the one
that sits up here

00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,870
between the bear
and the rat...
(laughter)

00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,650
And I want to ask,

00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,150
do you have distribution
right now?
Yes.

00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,730
It's regional, so...
regional.

00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,120
We're from colorado.

00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,370
We've been on the--the market
for a little over a year.

00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,950
(laughs)
In four months
after we launched our product,

00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,780
we were on the shelves
of colorado whole foods markets.

00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,780
So we are just regional
in the Rocky mountain

00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,230
for whole foods.

00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:39,820
One of the really cool things
that happened to us

00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,700
several months ago is petco
called us out of the blue.

00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:47,570
They wanted us to fill their 44
unleashed by petco stores.

00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,780
And...
it's all-natural
nonfat yogurt in it.

00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,730
And it has
organic peanut butter...
(laughs)

00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,230
Organic bananas,

00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:56,780
and the bacon is actually
nitrate-free bacon.
(drumroll)

00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,900
(Daymond) don't drop the dog,
Robert!
(cymbal crashes)

00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,900
(laughter)

00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,150
Oh, my god!

00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,730
Forget 24 months.
Robert's killing the rat!

00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:03,900
(laughter)

00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,650
It's okay, Buddy.
It's okay.

00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,870
We need another dog! (laughs)
Come here, Buddy.

00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:10,370
He's very athletic,
thankfully.

00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:12,870
(growls)
I'm so sorry.

00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,450
Oh, don't growl. It's okay.
He's gonna have to
make an offer now.

00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,370
All right. So let's
get back to business.
Let's get back to it, yeah.

00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:20,200
Let me walk you through
the potential here.

00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,980
We've made--in a little
over a year,

00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,870
we're at $30,000 in sales.

00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,980
Yes, I know that's not
an astronomical number.

00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,820
We did go to the largest
natural trade show

00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,450
Early This year.
Had an excellent response.

00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,950
Did you get orders
at that show?

00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,570
No orders. No orders.

00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:36,700
But we did
cultivate relationships.
That's not good.

00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,150
Well, I know. The thing is,
with a frozen product,

00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,820
it takes a little bit
more time

00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,700
to grow
that distribution network

00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,700
and to make sure--
Is that an excuse
for no sales?

00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,030
"It takes a little bit
more time"?

00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,230
it's tougher than that,
because there's Only--

00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,030
There's Only so much
freezer space...

00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,320
This is True.
In--In any location.

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,480
They fight over it.
This is True.

00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,150
And they fight.
So how do you overcome that?

00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:58,450
People look at our packaging
and become overjoyed by it.

00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:01,570
Nobody looks at packaging
and becomes overjoyed!

00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,870
(laughs)
I don't know.

00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,400
I'm pretty happy
when I look at that package.

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,870
(Kevin)
So, Megan and Matt, if you know

00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,980
that you're coming
into the Shark Tank,

00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,900
and you're gonna put
a value of $625,000

00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,370
on a business
that does $30,000...
yes.

00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:13,620
Did I hear the answer

00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,570
of why you felt
it was worth that much?

00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:18,320
Um, okay. So... goodwill.

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,980
Goodwill, uh, valuation.

00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,950
(laughter)
I know. I know.

00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,400
Forget it.
Just goodwill.

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,070
Megan, how do you think
it's going in the Shark Tank?

00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:28,980
(laughter)

00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,570
When all the investors
are laughing,

00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:31,980
that's not good.

00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,450
And it's a fun product.
It really is.

00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:34,870
Guys, let's speed this up.

00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:37,150
Why don't you tell me
what I'm gonna say next?

00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:39,200
You're out.
Thank you.

00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,070
Your valuation
is 21 times sales.

00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,980
Right, right.
Even the rat's unhappy
with that.

00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,980
(laughter)
Oh, no.
He's quite happy.

00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,120
He's out.
So what's the reason
you would ask so much?

00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,980
We work with, um,
an advisor.

00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,950
He's a director of operations
at a natural foods company.

00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,780
But he's not
writing a check.
I know.

00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,820
People love their dogs.

00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,620
I mean, they will go
to the ends of the earth.

00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,070
I mean,
myself and Meg included.

00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,950
You know,
there's a piece of advice

00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,870
that I like
to relay to entrepreneurs.

00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,320
Yes.
Never take advice

00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,900
from somebody who doesn't have
to live with the consequences.

00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,280
Right. Right.
Right.
You guys do,

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,400
and the consequences
of misvaluing your company

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,730
coming into the Shark Tank
is that amount.

00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,320
Right.

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,820
Well, we're willing
to negotiate the...

00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,870
(laughter)

00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:25,870
the category,
to me, is too small.

00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,950
I don't think
it's investable.

00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:28,900
I'm out.

00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,900
Well, I love both of you.

00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,700
I mean, I think
you are a fantastic couple.

00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,030
I know there's a market
for treats for dogs.

00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,950
Just give it
a little bit of time.

00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,530
Keep thinking. Keep pushing.

00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:43,530
I think you'll make it.

00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,870
But for me
as an investment,

00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:46,820
I'm out.

00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:51,950
Matt, you know,
you do have great packaging.

00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,200
I love the name
the bear &amp; the rat.

00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,150
I mean, it makes me laugh.

00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,650
I can't say it
without laughing.

00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,530
I think you guys
are good operators.

00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:07,820
I love the whole shtick.

00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,730
Love the dog.
(Matt and Meg laugh)

00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:13,120
I can't get beyond the value.

00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,700
I'm out.

00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,450
Thanks.
Thank you.

00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:20,450
Hey, Matt,
before you go,

00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:21,700
can you get Laika
to do a trick?

00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,700
Of course.

00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,900
Little high five.
High five.

00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,480
(laughter)
There you go.
There you go.

00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,900
Thanks again.
Thanks, guys.

00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,950
(Matt) Thank you.
(Lori) Thank you.

00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,450
Robert, it looked like you were
chasing a greased pig.

00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,120
Poor little dog.

00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,620
What the hell
were you doing, Robert?
(laughs) Like this...

00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,700
come here.
You know what?

00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,870
I was so tired
of the four of you,

00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:38,530
I thought the dog
would enjoy some company.

Next up are Daniel Wood
and David Martschinske

00:23:49,164 --> 00:23:51,964
with an innovation
for personal transportation.

00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:53,084
(laughter)

00:23:53,084 --> 00:23:55,794
Oh, that is so cool.

00:24:06,164 --> 00:24:07,214
(laughter)

00:24:07,214 --> 00:24:08,834
Hey, sharks,
I'm Daniel Wood...

00:24:08,834 --> 00:24:10,134
and I'm David Martschinske,

00:24:10,134 --> 00:24:11,834
and our product
is the first and only

00:24:11,834 --> 00:24:13,964
electric
self-balancing unicycle,

00:24:13,964 --> 00:24:15,964
or sbu for short.

00:24:15,964 --> 00:24:17,964
We are asking for $300,000

00:24:17,964 --> 00:24:20,494
in exchange for 10% equity
in our company.

00:24:20,494 --> 00:24:21,664
So how does it work?

00:24:21,664 --> 00:24:24,494
Basically, there are
three rate gyros,

00:24:24,494 --> 00:24:26,994
three accelerometers,
a powerful 32-Bit processor

00:24:26,994 --> 00:24:29,134
running p.I.D. Loops,
fuzzy logic, and kalman filters,

00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,914
calculating the exact angle
of the sbu.

00:24:31,914 --> 00:24:33,664
The motor is then
driven forward and backward

00:24:33,664 --> 00:24:35,964
in a locked, anti-phase
P.W.M. Configuration.

00:24:35,964 --> 00:24:37,494
Keep going.
Keep going.

00:24:37,494 --> 00:24:38,994
Don't worry, sharks.
I speak nerd,

00:24:38,994 --> 00:24:41,134
and I can provide
the translation.

00:24:41,134 --> 00:24:42,584
What Daniel's trying to say here

00:24:42,584 --> 00:24:44,914
is that the sbu has some really
smart sensors inside of it

00:24:44,914 --> 00:24:46,134
similar to the segway,

00:24:46,134 --> 00:24:47,584
that will always
keep you balanced.

00:24:47,584 --> 00:24:49,164
Why don't you show them
how it works, Dan?

00:24:50,914 --> 00:24:52,634
The hardest part
of a regular unicycle

00:24:52,634 --> 00:24:54,494
is the pedaling
to keep you balanced.

00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:55,744
But you don't have to worry
about that at all

00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:56,964
with the sbu.

00:24:56,964 --> 00:24:59,294
It does all that for you
with no pedaling.

00:24:59,294 --> 00:25:02,044
The sbu's motion is
intuitive to your movements,

00:25:02,044 --> 00:25:04,584
making riding feel easy
and second-nature.

00:25:04,584 --> 00:25:06,044
And it's so portable,

00:25:06,044 --> 00:25:07,964
you can put it
underneath your desk at work.

00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:10,044
And because it's hands-Free,
if you're like Daniel,

00:25:10,044 --> 00:25:12,164
you can program
a t.I.-85 graphing calculator.

00:25:12,164 --> 00:25:14,464
What a nerd.
(laughs)

00:25:14,464 --> 00:25:16,084
(laughter)

00:25:16,084 --> 00:25:18,294
Even a nerdy laugh.

00:25:18,294 --> 00:25:20,884
The sbu is capable of speeds
of 15 miles per hour,

00:25:20,884 --> 00:25:23,584
and going ten miles
on a single charge.

00:25:23,584 --> 00:25:26,334
What sharks are ready to
ride nerdy with these two guys?

00:25:26,334 --> 00:25:27,884
Nerdy. (laughs)
(Robert) can I try it?

00:25:27,884 --> 00:25:29,544
You want to come
see how it feels? Yeah.

00:25:29,544 --> 00:25:30,994
We got a helmet for you.

00:25:30,994 --> 00:25:33,164
Okay.
Here's how it works.

00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:34,634
You turn the power on...
okay.

00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:35,994
You see it--It's balancing
forward and back,

00:25:35,994 --> 00:25:37,214
so you put your hand here,
you can feel it.

00:25:37,214 --> 00:25:38,884
So you just
lean it forward...
Lean forward.

00:25:38,884 --> 00:25:39,884
To get more speed,

00:25:39,884 --> 00:25:41,914
and you lean it back
to slow down.

00:25:41,914 --> 00:25:44,664
Whoa! You can
feel it moving.

00:25:44,664 --> 00:25:46,884
Whoa--Whoa.

00:25:46,884 --> 00:25:48,214
All right, hang on.
I gotta get this.

00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:49,994
It takes about 20 minutes
to learn, usually,

00:25:49,994 --> 00:25:52,044
in a large parking lot.
I gotta try it.

00:25:52,044 --> 00:25:53,584
(Robert) All right.
Come on up here.

00:25:53,584 --> 00:25:55,714
It's a lot harder than
I thought it would be.

00:25:55,714 --> 00:25:57,494
In my early years
in the circus...

00:25:57,494 --> 00:25:58,794
(laughter)

00:25:58,794 --> 00:26:01,964
Just lean it forward
to go.
That is very cool.

00:26:01,964 --> 00:26:03,044
Lean it back
to slow down.

00:26:03,044 --> 00:26:04,414
(Robert) Let him go!
(Daniel laughs)

00:26:04,414 --> 00:26:07,134
I can turn. Very cool.

00:26:07,134 --> 00:26:09,384
How much are they?
Retail, $1,800.

00:26:09,384 --> 00:26:11,914
I want one.
But I want a deal.
(laughter)

00:26:11,914 --> 00:26:13,744
Make a deal,
we'll give you one for free.

00:26:13,744 --> 00:26:16,384
I think I could get it.
I think I could get it.

00:26:16,384 --> 00:26:18,834
And you've been selling them
for how long?

00:26:18,834 --> 00:26:21,334
We just finished tooling up
our factory overseas.

00:26:21,334 --> 00:26:23,414
First 100 units
are finishing up this week,

00:26:23,414 --> 00:26:25,544
and we've already sold
all of them.

00:26:25,544 --> 00:26:26,914
What was your cost?

00:26:26,914 --> 00:26:28,464
$350,000 for this first run.

00:26:28,464 --> 00:26:30,914
And you sold the first 100
at $1,800?

00:26:30,914 --> 00:26:32,744
Yeah, just off of our web site.

00:26:32,744 --> 00:26:33,914
Daniel, do you know
what happened

00:26:33,914 --> 00:26:35,494
to, uh, one of the founders
of the segway?

00:26:35,494 --> 00:26:36,914
He had an accident.

00:26:36,914 --> 00:26:38,584
Yeah. He hopped on the segway,

00:26:38,584 --> 00:26:40,584
and it fell into the river,
and he drowned.

00:26:40,584 --> 00:26:42,334
Oh, my God.

00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:45,214
Why didn't the segway work?

00:26:45,214 --> 00:26:47,244
Why didn't people buy it?
The segway was hyped

00:26:47,244 --> 00:26:48,714
like no other product.

00:26:48,714 --> 00:26:50,464
I'm not gonna talk bad
about the segway,

00:26:50,464 --> 00:26:52,164
but you can't do this
with the segway.

00:26:52,164 --> 00:26:53,634
The nail in
the segway coffin

00:26:53,634 --> 00:26:55,384
was banning it
from the sidewalk.

00:26:55,384 --> 00:26:56,884
Have you gone
into that issue

00:26:56,884 --> 00:26:58,794
and asked anybody
at the city level,

00:26:58,794 --> 00:27:00,884
would you ban this device
from my city?

00:27:00,884 --> 00:27:01,914
They're not nearly as big.

00:27:01,914 --> 00:27:03,384
I don't think they're
gonna have a problem.

00:27:03,384 --> 00:27:04,964
'cause it's single-Wheel.
It's not wide.

00:27:04,964 --> 00:27:07,664
We've been stopped
by many officers,

00:27:07,664 --> 00:27:08,884
only because
they love the product.

00:27:08,884 --> 00:27:10,884
They ask the same questions
you guys do.

00:27:10,884 --> 00:27:12,494
"When--Where can I get one?
They're cool."

00:27:12,494 --> 00:27:16,494
I need to feel passionately
about whatever I invest in.

00:27:16,494 --> 00:27:18,244
I love the two of you,

00:27:18,244 --> 00:27:20,884
but I don't feel passionate
about this product.

00:27:20,884 --> 00:27:22,914
For that reason,
I'm out.

00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:27,714
You know, I was interested
for a second.

00:27:27,714 --> 00:27:31,794
I was unaware that the segway
business model doesn't work.

00:27:31,794 --> 00:27:33,964
Is that--that true, Robert?
Horrible.

00:27:33,964 --> 00:27:35,714
Horrible. One of
the biggest losses

00:27:35,714 --> 00:27:38,134
in terms of investment.

00:27:38,134 --> 00:27:40,464
I am not willing
to take this risk.

00:27:40,464 --> 00:27:41,634
I'm out.

00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:45,214
A difficult decision.
I hate those,

00:27:45,214 --> 00:27:47,544
because I'm very interested.
I see a lot of the merits.

00:27:47,544 --> 00:27:50,384
But I don't know
if it's worth $3 million.

00:27:50,384 --> 00:27:52,994
Well, let us tell you about
our--Our future sales.

00:27:52,994 --> 00:27:54,214
A very conservative Number

00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,834
is selling 1,000 of these
in 12 months,

00:27:55,834 --> 00:27:57,744
which puts us
at $1 million profit.

00:27:57,744 --> 00:28:00,464
You could do a million in profit
in the next 12 months?

00:28:00,464 --> 00:28:01,544
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

00:28:01,544 --> 00:28:02,794
How are you guys gonna do
quality assurance

00:28:02,794 --> 00:28:04,134
when it's produced overseas?

00:28:04,134 --> 00:28:07,084
'Cause if--If you run into
any manufacturing issues at all,

00:28:07,084 --> 00:28:08,664
you're toast.

00:28:08,664 --> 00:28:12,334
We visited the factory.
We've already worked with them.

00:28:12,334 --> 00:28:14,544
But having them tell you,
"Oh, we're good"

00:28:14,544 --> 00:28:15,914
is a whole lot different

00:28:15,914 --> 00:28:18,994
than them actually delivering
the quality that you expect.

00:28:18,994 --> 00:28:20,084
I mean, look at apple.

00:28:20,084 --> 00:28:21,994
They went through
the same thing, right?

00:28:21,994 --> 00:28:23,294
Brilliant design.

00:28:23,294 --> 00:28:26,884
But I hate trust--Trusting
overseas manufacturing.

00:28:26,884 --> 00:28:29,834
And so for that reason,
I'm out.

00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:30,964
Okay.

00:28:30,964 --> 00:28:33,834
For me to give you
a $3 million valuation today,

00:28:33,834 --> 00:28:37,044
I have to believe
in the mass transport market.

00:28:37,044 --> 00:28:38,994
And I've seen other people
fail in that.

00:28:38,994 --> 00:28:40,634
I know you're different.

00:28:40,634 --> 00:28:42,084
Well, before
you say you're out,

00:28:42,084 --> 00:28:45,384
we do have the most advanced
ebyte controller

00:28:45,384 --> 00:28:46,664
on the market in here.

00:28:46,664 --> 00:28:48,494
I designed
the circuit board.

00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:52,294
I embedded a lot of technology
that's very proprietary to us.

00:28:52,294 --> 00:28:53,914
Oh, I didn't realize that.
But do you have patents?

00:28:53,914 --> 00:28:56,384
We have patents
filed, yes.

00:28:56,384 --> 00:28:58,914
Filed.
We're already talking
with e-bike manufacturers

00:28:58,914 --> 00:29:01,634
who want to license
this technology from us.

00:29:01,634 --> 00:29:03,414
In fact, we've already licensed
it to one other company,

00:29:03,414 --> 00:29:05,834
and we're receiving royalties
on that right now.

00:29:05,834 --> 00:29:08,744
Wait a minute. You said--
You didn't say that before.

00:29:08,744 --> 00:29:10,414
How much royalties
are you receiving?

00:29:10,414 --> 00:29:12,834
$25,000 in royalties.
In how long?

00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,164
About three months.

00:29:16,834 --> 00:29:19,084
Daniel, incredibly impressive.

00:29:19,084 --> 00:29:21,744
You've definitely
got something there.

00:29:23,414 --> 00:29:24,794
I buy the technology,

00:29:24,794 --> 00:29:26,994
But not at
a $3 million value.

00:29:30,214 --> 00:29:31,414
I mean, I'm happy to offer you

00:29:31,414 --> 00:29:33,744
$300,000 for 33%.

00:29:37,794 --> 00:29:39,964
I would join Robert if you
take me into that offer.

00:29:42,794 --> 00:29:45,714
I just spent $5,000
ordering an electric bike.

00:29:45,714 --> 00:29:47,884
I think that market's gonna
be absolutely huge,

00:29:47,884 --> 00:29:49,244
and it doesn't have
this technology in it.

00:29:49,244 --> 00:29:52,464
Are there any other offers?
Anyone else wanna...

00:29:52,464 --> 00:29:54,794
you're playing a very dangerous
balancing act right now.

00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:57,384
You have two sharks interested

00:29:57,384 --> 00:30:00,084
when honestly, I think
we were all gonna be out.

00:30:00,084 --> 00:30:01,914
I don't think you should waste
much more time.

00:30:09,244 --> 00:30:10,964
(Chin straps click)

00:30:10,964 --> 00:30:12,744
Let's do it.
Yeah, let's do it, sharks.

00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:14,134
All right.
Congratulations, guys.

00:30:14,134 --> 00:30:15,664
Congratulations.
Come on, guys,
get excited about this.

00:30:15,664 --> 00:30:17,834
Whoo!
There you go.

00:30:17,834 --> 00:30:19,084
The technology's
gonna make money.

00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:20,214
We're gonna make
a lot of money.

00:30:20,214 --> 00:30:21,714
Congratulations, guys.

00:30:22,794 --> 00:30:23,914
Man, that was awesome.

00:30:23,914 --> 00:30:24,914
We just made a deal

00:30:24,914 --> 00:30:26,584
with two of the biggest nerds
on "Shark Tank."

00:30:26,584 --> 00:30:27,884
We're gonna make
a lot of money,

00:30:27,884 --> 00:30:29,084
and we're gonna put
an sbu

00:30:29,084 --> 00:30:30,794
in every cubicle
around America.

00:30:30,794 --> 00:30:32,964

I'm Shelton Wilder.

00:30:47,073 --> 00:30:48,153
I love fashion.

00:30:48,153 --> 00:30:50,033
I currently work
as a fashion stylist.

00:30:50,033 --> 00:30:52,703
I want to get
a few looks for you.

00:30:52,703 --> 00:30:54,033
My clients will come to me,

00:30:54,033 --> 00:30:55,903
and I will put
Their entire look together.

00:30:55,903 --> 00:30:58,533
Their dress, their shoes,
their jewelry,

00:30:58,533 --> 00:30:59,533
the entire thing.

00:30:59,533 --> 00:31:00,573
Oh, it's really cute.
Okay.

00:31:00,573 --> 00:31:01,733
I came up with my product

00:31:01,733 --> 00:31:04,073
when I was styling
and managing a boutique,

00:31:04,073 --> 00:31:06,373
and I needed this
for my clients,

00:31:06,373 --> 00:31:08,573
and so it evolved
through sheer necessity.

00:31:08,573 --> 00:31:10,123
My product is
the perfect piece

00:31:10,123 --> 00:31:12,403
to help bring runway fashions
to real life.

00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:13,983
And it's a must-Have
for every woman.

00:31:13,983 --> 00:31:15,533
And literally, you'll wear this

00:31:15,533 --> 00:31:18,983
and wonder how you ever
got dressed without it.

00:31:18,983 --> 00:31:21,733
To get to where I am today,
I've overcome a lot.

00:31:21,733 --> 00:31:23,573
There's been a lot,
a lot of struggles.

00:31:23,573 --> 00:31:25,453
This is my second chance,

00:31:25,453 --> 00:31:27,203
so I have a lot
riding on this.

00:31:27,203 --> 00:31:29,653
I have the pattern here
that I need to send to you.

00:31:29,653 --> 00:31:31,403
My business
is a work in progress,

00:31:31,403 --> 00:31:34,283
and currently, I do not have
the inventory to sell it.

00:31:34,283 --> 00:31:36,033
And if I don't get
an investment from the sharks,

00:31:36,033 --> 00:31:37,873
I don't know
if my company will survive.

00:31:54,533 --> 00:31:55,903
Hey, y'all.

00:31:55,903 --> 00:31:57,123
My name is Shelton Wilder,

00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,783
and I'm really
excited to be here.

00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:01,373
And the name
of my company is Shemie.

00:32:01,373 --> 00:32:02,373
The Shemie.

00:32:03,573 --> 00:32:05,953
I'm seeking an investment
of $60,000

00:32:05,953 --> 00:32:08,153
for 20% of my business.

00:32:08,153 --> 00:32:11,983
Okay. So when did we give
the slip, the slip?

00:32:11,983 --> 00:32:13,283
I don't know.

00:32:13,283 --> 00:32:15,623
But I am bringing it back,
but in a modern way.

00:32:15,623 --> 00:32:17,373
This is not
your granny's slip.

00:32:17,373 --> 00:32:19,903
No. Not like this.
Gross.

00:32:19,903 --> 00:32:21,533
(chuckles)
My design is simple,

00:32:21,533 --> 00:32:22,983
elegant, yet flirty,

00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:24,483
and is an every day
wardrobe staple

00:32:24,483 --> 00:32:27,283
for every woman
and every different body.

00:32:27,283 --> 00:32:28,783
Now the reason
I came up with this

00:32:28,783 --> 00:32:30,453
is because
I'm a fashion stylist.

00:32:30,453 --> 00:32:32,403
I love fashion,
but way more importantly,

00:32:32,403 --> 00:32:34,783
I love helping women
look and feel amazing.

00:32:34,783 --> 00:32:35,783
That's my life.

00:32:35,783 --> 00:32:37,783
I am wearing the scoop,

00:32:37,783 --> 00:32:39,873
which I like to call
the "meet the parents."

00:32:39,873 --> 00:32:41,653
So you're not showing
too much cleavage.

00:32:41,653 --> 00:32:43,483
No! That is inappropriate.

00:32:43,483 --> 00:32:45,123
Y'all know
that I am Southern.

00:32:45,123 --> 00:32:49,953
Okay, next, the Shemie is
the perfect layering piece.

00:32:49,953 --> 00:32:52,403
And Deborah has it
layered here with leggings.

00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:55,033
Because remember, guys,
leggings aren't pants.

00:32:55,033 --> 00:32:56,903
No, no, no.
That's rude.

00:32:56,903 --> 00:32:59,453
Now Katie's wearing
this cute little dress,

00:32:59,453 --> 00:33:00,533
but it's very short,

00:33:00,533 --> 00:33:02,573
so she has on
the Shemie wrapper,

00:33:02,573 --> 00:33:06,123
or more accurately called
"the paparazzi protector."

00:33:06,123 --> 00:33:07,703
(laughter)
For the... (laughs)

00:33:07,703 --> 00:33:09,733
For those nights out getting
in and out of the car

00:33:09,733 --> 00:33:11,983
without any
wardrobe malfunctions.

00:33:11,983 --> 00:33:13,533
Yeah, you know
who you are.

00:33:14,623 --> 00:33:18,283
Okay, sharks, I need your help
to give to women

00:33:18,283 --> 00:33:20,453
exactly what they've been
missing in their life--

00:33:20,453 --> 00:33:21,783
the Shemie.

00:33:21,783 --> 00:33:24,453
Now I have the passion
and the positron,

00:33:24,453 --> 00:33:26,373
so who wants to swim
on This fun journey

00:33:26,373 --> 00:33:27,623
with my Shemie and me?

00:33:27,623 --> 00:33:30,653
The positron, huh? (laughs)
Whoo! Positron!

00:33:30,653 --> 00:33:33,203
So, Shelton, it's not
a fashion piece?

00:33:33,203 --> 00:33:35,703
It's something to wear
underneath other clothing?

00:33:35,703 --> 00:33:38,323
Yes, it's a foundation piece,
but not a shaper.

00:33:38,323 --> 00:33:39,903
If you are
a larger woman,

00:33:39,903 --> 00:33:41,873
is this going to accentuate
your largeness,

00:33:41,873 --> 00:33:43,483
or diminish it?

00:33:43,483 --> 00:33:46,373
The point is, is that there's
so many shapers on the market--

00:33:46,373 --> 00:33:48,283
Things that squeeze you,
fat dislocators.

00:33:48,283 --> 00:33:50,953
But these are made
to be comfortable.

00:33:50,953 --> 00:33:53,033
You know, it's not always you
wanna squeeze into something

00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:55,123
and not feel great
in that.

00:33:55,123 --> 00:33:56,533
Tell us your background,
Shelton.

00:33:56,533 --> 00:33:58,283
You know, you said
you're a personal stylist.

00:33:58,283 --> 00:34:00,153
I have been in fashion
since I was 16.

00:34:00,153 --> 00:34:02,123
I was a buyer,
then a manager.

00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,403
I ran
this amazing store...
Where were you a buyer at,

00:34:04,403 --> 00:34:05,453
and where were you
a manager at?

00:34:05,453 --> 00:34:07,873
At this store in Charlotte
called, uh, Capitol.

00:34:07,873 --> 00:34:08,983
Like this blouse
is from there.

00:34:08,983 --> 00:34:10,533
This was, like,
a $1,200 blouse.

00:34:10,533 --> 00:34:13,623
How rude is it to go
and buy something like this

00:34:13,623 --> 00:34:15,453
and then sell it
at your boutique

00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:17,533
and not have an underpinning?

00:34:17,533 --> 00:34:19,033
Incredibly rude.

00:34:19,033 --> 00:34:21,283
And so I have been
at Nordstrom now.

00:34:21,283 --> 00:34:23,123
And so it's like
I wanted to go

00:34:23,123 --> 00:34:24,653
to all
the different markets...
you're in Nordstrom
with the product?

00:34:24,653 --> 00:34:25,823
That's the exciting news.

00:34:25,823 --> 00:34:27,373
I have been
a stylist at Nordstrom,

00:34:27,373 --> 00:34:29,153
and I've developed
amazing relationships.

00:34:29,153 --> 00:34:31,573
And they have the product
in Seattle right now,

00:34:31,573 --> 00:34:32,823
and I have kind of
a verbal agreement

00:34:32,823 --> 00:34:34,533
that we'll be
carrying it there.

00:34:34,533 --> 00:34:36,123
A verbal agreement?
A verbal agreement.

00:34:36,123 --> 00:34:37,373
I don't have
the signed paper.

00:34:37,373 --> 00:34:38,903
But I just started
the company,

00:34:38,903 --> 00:34:41,153
you know, I--six weeks ago.

00:34:41,153 --> 00:34:43,123
Six weeks ago?

00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:44,483
Do you have any sales?

00:34:44,483 --> 00:34:45,823
Okay, with the sales,

00:34:45,823 --> 00:34:48,483
I have ten stores
that have soft orders.

00:34:48,483 --> 00:34:51,233
And then I also
have five other--
What's a soft order?

00:34:51,233 --> 00:34:54,453
Meaning, like, they're
definitely placing the orders.

00:34:54,453 --> 00:34:55,823
But--

00:34:55,823 --> 00:34:58,033
so it's a long way
of saying you have no sales.

00:34:58,033 --> 00:35:00,453
You're offering 20%
for $60,000

00:35:00,453 --> 00:35:01,823
to any shark
that's interested.

00:35:01,823 --> 00:35:03,403
That means you've valued
this business

00:35:03,403 --> 00:35:06,073
at $300,000.
Hundred...

00:35:06,073 --> 00:35:07,623
you've sold nothing.

00:35:07,623 --> 00:35:09,123
Make a case,

00:35:09,123 --> 00:35:11,533
because I don't want to tear you
to pieces on this,

00:35:11,533 --> 00:35:12,533
but I may have to.

00:35:12,533 --> 00:35:13,733
I am such a hustler.

00:35:13,733 --> 00:35:15,453
Like, I don't think
you understand.

00:35:15,453 --> 00:35:17,123
I know maybe I'm presenting
like Southern Belle.

00:35:17,123 --> 00:35:19,623
No. I will get out there
on the streets.

00:35:19,623 --> 00:35:21,533
Like, I will get
to stepping here.

00:35:21,533 --> 00:35:23,403
And I love helping women
look and feel amazing.

00:35:23,403 --> 00:35:25,403
So do I, every day.

00:35:25,403 --> 00:35:27,403
Okay, good. Well,
then you need to help me here!

00:35:27,403 --> 00:35:28,733
Come on!
Yeah, but my problem is
the valuation's insane.

00:35:28,733 --> 00:35:30,233
You have no sales.

00:35:30,233 --> 00:35:31,953
You have no sales that have
generated any profits.

00:35:31,953 --> 00:35:33,373
Look...
(sighs)

00:35:33,373 --> 00:35:35,403
It's just that to tell me
it's worth $300,000 today

00:35:35,403 --> 00:35:36,453
is problematic

00:35:36,453 --> 00:35:39,483
because I'm a disciplined
financial investor.

00:35:39,483 --> 00:35:42,623
I want some evidence
that I'm gonna make money.

00:35:42,623 --> 00:35:43,823
Okay.

00:35:43,823 --> 00:35:46,533
So for that reason,
I'm out.

00:35:46,533 --> 00:35:49,283
Thank you.

00:35:49,283 --> 00:35:51,073
Did you sell any
to all those customers

00:35:51,073 --> 00:35:53,533
that needed something
that was right?

00:35:53,533 --> 00:35:55,573
Absolutely. They're so excited.
They want this product again.

00:35:55,573 --> 00:35:57,373
They're like, "I've gotta
have more of these."

00:35:57,373 --> 00:35:59,123
So technically,
you have sold some.

00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:02,073
How many have you sold that you
were just making on the side?

00:36:02,073 --> 00:36:03,283
Oh.

00:36:03,283 --> 00:36:07,233
Well, recently? I mean...

00:36:07,233 --> 00:36:11,373
like, but--I had had some
with a--That were similar

00:36:11,373 --> 00:36:14,033
in my company
that I worked with before.

00:36:14,033 --> 00:36:15,573
And so I just--I just--
What do you mean you w--

00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,533
You--You had a company
you owned before?

00:36:17,533 --> 00:36:18,623
Company that I worked with
before.

00:36:18,623 --> 00:36:21,153
You worked with somebody
who made this type of item?

00:36:21,153 --> 00:36:24,403
This--This is my--This is
my design all--All along.

00:36:24,403 --> 00:36:25,483
So you stole this--
But they were making
and selling it?

00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:26,873
I'm lost here.
Yes.

00:36:26,873 --> 00:36:28,873
You came up with the idea here?

00:36:28,873 --> 00:36:30,573
There was a similar company
that I had with my best friend.

00:36:30,573 --> 00:36:33,703
So you knocked off your former
company for your design?
No. No.

00:36:33,703 --> 00:36:36,403
(Robert) You gotta--You--
We're all...
we're totally lost.

00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:38,283
I know. I know.
Reboot.

00:36:38,283 --> 00:36:41,483
How much did you sell
of the similar product

00:36:41,483 --> 00:36:42,873
together in that company?

00:36:42,873 --> 00:36:44,453
$150,000 in 18 months.

00:36:44,453 --> 00:36:46,283
Like, we were selling
everywhere.

00:36:46,283 --> 00:36:47,733
And why did it stop?
So as we're all asking you,

00:36:47,733 --> 00:36:51,483
"what have your sale been?"
technically, you could've said,

00:36:51,483 --> 00:36:53,873
"$150,000 in the last 2 years."

00:36:53,873 --> 00:36:55,073
Okay.

00:36:55,073 --> 00:36:56,483
Yeah, what happened
to that company?

00:36:56,483 --> 00:36:57,453
Why'd you stop?
Why did you stop?

00:36:57,453 --> 00:37:00,783
Well..
she had a family emergency

00:37:00,783 --> 00:37:03,283
and she moved home.
Her--Her father passed away.

00:37:03,283 --> 00:37:05,483
So--
But why didn't you continue
the business?

00:37:05,483 --> 00:37:07,983
Because you must've built
some brand equity.
Right.

00:37:07,983 --> 00:37:11,153
Couldn't you continue
under that name?

00:37:11,153 --> 00:37:13,403
I-I couldn't continue under
that name because I was--

00:37:13,403 --> 00:37:14,983
I didn't have the capital
to do so.

00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:17,533
(Lori) If a company's successful
and you have a partner,

00:37:17,533 --> 00:37:19,533
just because a family member
passes away,

00:37:19,533 --> 00:37:21,903
it doesn't mean you shut down
the whole company.

00:37:21,903 --> 00:37:23,873
You had all these people
that loved it

00:37:23,873 --> 00:37:25,483
and everybody wanted it.

00:37:25,483 --> 00:37:27,073
I think all of us up here
are struggling a little bit...

00:37:27,073 --> 00:37:29,873
(Robert) Yeah.
With understanding why,

00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:31,573
if it was
a successful business...
(sighs deeply)

00:37:31,573 --> 00:37:34,203
Should I say it? Okay.
You did a $150,000 worth,

00:37:34,203 --> 00:37:35,373
why you would stop.

00:37:35,373 --> 00:37:37,783
I mean, are you holding out
telling us something?

00:37:37,783 --> 00:37:39,373
Well, I...

00:37:39,373 --> 00:37:40,783
out with it.

00:37:40,783 --> 00:37:43,533
Um, during that time...

00:37:43,533 --> 00:37:46,453
(sighs) I can't believe
I'm gonna say this.

00:37:46,453 --> 00:37:48,983
♪♪♪

00:37:52,023 --> 00:37:54,633
♪♪♪

00:37:54,633 --> 00:37:56,767
Are you holding out
telling us something?

00:37:56,767 --> 00:37:57,987
Well, I...

00:37:57,987 --> 00:38:00,187
Out with it.

00:38:00,187 --> 00:38:02,107
Um, during that time...

00:38:02,107 --> 00:38:06,067
(sighs) I can't believe
I'm gonna say this.

00:38:06,067 --> 00:38:07,907
(voice breaking)
I was going through a lot of...

00:38:07,907 --> 00:38:09,687
struggles, and, um...

00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:13,317
so now I...
I cannot believe this.

00:38:13,317 --> 00:38:15,107
I've been sober
two years and eight months.

00:38:15,107 --> 00:38:18,767
And so I kinda went through
a big change in my life.

00:38:18,767 --> 00:38:23,107
And went back to being a stylist
and got an amazing job

00:38:23,107 --> 00:38:25,357
within a company 'cause
I-I didn't have the capital--

00:38:25,357 --> 00:38:28,317
(Lori) We appreciate your
being honest with us about that.

00:38:28,317 --> 00:38:30,437
Yeah, I just--
and there's never anything
to be ashamed of.

00:38:30,437 --> 00:38:33,157
And I appreciate very much that
you've just shared that with us

00:38:33,157 --> 00:38:35,567
and that we understand
what happened.
Yeah.

00:38:35,567 --> 00:38:36,987
Shelton, here--Here's the part
that I'm--

00:38:36,987 --> 00:38:39,687
I'm still
a little confused about.
Okay.

00:38:39,687 --> 00:38:43,517
The hardest thing in business
to build is a name.

00:38:43,517 --> 00:38:44,857
Mm-hmm.

00:38:44,857 --> 00:38:48,487
You and your friend start
this business. It's successful.

00:38:48,487 --> 00:38:50,237
What happened to that business?

00:38:50,237 --> 00:38:53,017
I wanted a fresh start.

00:38:53,017 --> 00:38:55,607
It wasn't great memories
for me.

00:38:55,607 --> 00:38:57,817
Sheltini is an alcoholic
beverage... (laughs)

00:38:57,817 --> 00:38:59,357
and I'm not one anymore.

00:38:59,357 --> 00:39:01,357
That was the name
of the other company.

00:39:01,357 --> 00:39:04,437
So it's kind of for me, that's
what--like, it was not good.
(sighs deeply)

00:39:04,437 --> 00:39:06,187
That--That was it.
Did you go bankrupt?

00:39:07,407 --> 00:39:10,567
I-I went bankrupt personally.

00:39:12,687 --> 00:39:14,567
Here's what happens
in the Shark Tank--

00:39:14,567 --> 00:39:16,857
The truth always comes out.

00:39:16,857 --> 00:39:18,657
It's impossible to hide
in here.

00:39:18,657 --> 00:39:20,267
I wasn't trying
to hide that.

00:39:20,267 --> 00:39:22,607
Why didn't you just bring it
all out right up front?

00:39:22,607 --> 00:39:24,107
Hi! My name
is Shelton Wilder.

00:39:24,107 --> 00:39:26,737
I went bankrupt
and I went to rehab.

00:39:26,737 --> 00:39:27,767
Like, I don't--
I don't understand.

00:39:27,767 --> 00:39:29,367
Might've worked better for you
because we understand hardship

00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,133
and we understand
people getting back up.

00:39:31,133 --> 00:39:31,967
And in some ways,

00:39:31,967 --> 00:39:33,587
investing in somebody
that's tasted that sting

00:39:33,587 --> 00:39:35,667
is better than one
that never has.

00:39:39,587 --> 00:39:43,087
Shelton, I think Kevin's
out of line. I--
No, he's not.

00:39:43,087 --> 00:39:45,887
This is business,
and the truth always comes out.

00:39:45,887 --> 00:39:47,887
Kevin's out of line.

00:39:47,887 --> 00:39:49,917
What's happened to you
in your personal life,

00:39:49,917 --> 00:39:52,837
that--Those are your challenges.

00:39:54,637 --> 00:39:56,137
Okay, so you've had this
ready to go in your mind,

00:39:56,137 --> 00:39:57,557
but you just had to
get your act together...
yes.

00:39:57,557 --> 00:39:59,257
Before you could
hit the ground running. Okay.
Absolutely.

00:39:59,257 --> 00:40:01,587
(Daymond) So...

00:40:01,587 --> 00:40:02,467
now that we've gotten
to the bottom of things,

00:40:02,467 --> 00:40:03,887
as we usually do...
(laughs)

00:40:03,887 --> 00:40:05,717
(Robert) Wow!
Uhh!

00:40:05,717 --> 00:40:08,507
I feel--I feel like we just
went through the 12 steps.

00:40:08,507 --> 00:40:09,467
No, I-I-I love it.

00:40:09,467 --> 00:40:12,217
No, you understand
what the problem was.

00:40:12,217 --> 00:40:14,667
I appreciate your time
and respect you guys so much.

00:40:14,667 --> 00:40:17,637
Like, it's huge. I mean,
it's an honor to be here.

00:40:17,637 --> 00:40:20,417
(voice breaks) Sorry. I just...
I'm really excited...

00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:22,057
(sighs) because...

00:40:23,557 --> 00:40:26,587
I've worked really hard
to get back to this.

00:40:26,587 --> 00:40:29,667
And, um, gosh, I believe
in this product so much.

00:40:29,667 --> 00:40:31,557
I could--I could not
get dressed without it.

00:40:31,557 --> 00:40:32,717
I literally couldn't.

00:40:32,717 --> 00:40:34,307
And that's the passion
that I have for this

00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:36,637
that I will bring
to every woman across America.

00:40:36,637 --> 00:40:39,557
I believe in this so much.
Like, this is my baby.

00:40:39,557 --> 00:40:42,417
Shelton, we all appreciate
your passion.
Yeah.

00:40:42,417 --> 00:40:43,507
And I think everybody here
would commend you

00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:46,917
for picking yourself up in life
and starting again.

00:40:46,917 --> 00:40:49,467
'cause that's what life
is all about.

00:40:49,467 --> 00:40:51,807
Would you wear one?
Do you feel like--

00:40:51,807 --> 00:40:54,257
I would.
Do you feel like it's a--

00:40:54,257 --> 00:40:57,007
something that's kind of missing
out there in the market?

00:40:57,007 --> 00:41:00,007
I like it and I think that
there is a need for it.

00:41:00,007 --> 00:41:01,717
I think
the biggest problem is

00:41:01,717 --> 00:41:04,507
there are so many things
out there that are similar.

00:41:04,507 --> 00:41:06,717
They might not
be exactly like yours.

00:41:06,717 --> 00:41:10,637
If you just keep doing
what you've been doing,

00:41:10,637 --> 00:41:13,337
put all that great drive
into getting this out there,

00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:16,507
you will make it
without any of us.

00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:18,967
So for that reason,
I'm out.

00:41:18,967 --> 00:41:21,307
Okay.
You know, as Lori says,

00:41:21,307 --> 00:41:23,137
everybody deserves
a second chance.

00:41:23,137 --> 00:41:25,587
I have absolutely no problem
with your background.

00:41:25,587 --> 00:41:27,967
Putting that aside,
my challenge is,

00:41:27,967 --> 00:41:29,387
you've been doing it
for six weeks.

00:41:29,387 --> 00:41:31,507
It's just too early.

00:41:31,507 --> 00:41:34,667
I wish you all the best
of success in life.

00:41:34,667 --> 00:41:36,137
Today, I'm out.

00:41:36,137 --> 00:41:37,667
Okay. Thank you.

00:41:37,667 --> 00:41:40,717
I--You know, I'm not big
into women's fashion.

00:41:40,717 --> 00:41:42,337
Mm-Hmm.

00:41:42,337 --> 00:41:44,587
Um, but it's easy to see
that it has a lot of potential.

00:41:44,587 --> 00:41:46,557
So I wish I could help you
but I can't,

00:41:46,557 --> 00:41:48,257
and for that reason,
I'm out.

00:41:48,257 --> 00:41:49,637
Okay. Thank you.

00:41:49,637 --> 00:41:51,557
Thank you.

00:41:51,557 --> 00:41:53,057
I think your passion is
amazing.

00:41:53,057 --> 00:41:54,887
I think that you--You went
through some challenging times

00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:56,557
and you're gonna
even be better now

00:41:56,557 --> 00:41:58,387
because you know
what you faced, right?

00:41:58,387 --> 00:41:59,967
Yeah.
Six weeks of business

00:41:59,967 --> 00:42:02,667
and valuing the company
at $300,000

00:42:02,667 --> 00:42:05,217
in an area of fashion

00:42:05,217 --> 00:42:06,757
that I don't know...

00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:08,307
unfortunately, I'm out.

00:42:09,887 --> 00:42:12,637
Well, thank you, guys,
for your time today.

00:42:12,637 --> 00:42:13,637
I really appreciate it.

00:42:13,637 --> 00:42:15,257
Thank you. Good luck.
(Mark) Thanks, Shelton.

00:42:15,257 --> 00:42:16,467
(Daymond) Good luck.

00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:18,337
(Robert) Wow.

00:42:18,337 --> 00:42:20,587
We did go on a journey
with her.

00:42:20,587 --> 00:42:22,967
(Kevin) to nowhere.

00:42:22,967 --> 00:42:25,757
I am who I am,
and I have no secrets.

00:42:25,757 --> 00:42:27,557
I think these challenges
are gonna be, like,

00:42:27,557 --> 00:42:29,557
the biggest assets for me, so...

00:42:29,557 --> 00:42:31,967
I feel really grateful
for the experience

00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:34,467
and I'm excited
to keep moving forward.
