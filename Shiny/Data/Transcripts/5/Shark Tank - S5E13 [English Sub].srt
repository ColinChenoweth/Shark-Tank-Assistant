00:00:00,668 --> 00:00:03,985
NARRATOR:
This is the shark tank,
where hopeful entrepreneurs

00:00:03,985 --> 00:00:06,121
get a once-in-a-lifetime chance
to pitch the sharks

00:00:06,121 --> 00:00:08,025
in hopes of
getting an investment

00:00:08,025 --> 00:00:10,495
to start, grow,
or save their businesses.

00:00:10,495 --> 00:00:11,397
Go!
GIRL: Go!

00:00:11,397 --> 00:00:12,366
Come on, let's go!

00:00:12,366 --> 00:00:13,668
Let's go!
[ laughter ]

00:00:13,668 --> 00:00:16,690
NARRATOR: The entrepreneurs
must convince a shark

00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,394
to invest the full amount
they're asking for,

00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,398
or they'll
walk away with nothing.

00:00:21,398 --> 00:00:22,667
Americans are being watched!

00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:25,572
Whoa.
Well, I want to be filthy rich
like everyone else.

00:00:25,572 --> 00:00:28,544
We think the company
is worth $6 million.

00:00:28,544 --> 00:00:30,113
Oh!
Oh!
Wow.

00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,683
NARRATOR: If the sharks hear
a great idea...

00:00:31,683 --> 00:00:32,851
You could use it
as home plate

00:00:32,851 --> 00:00:34,087
in your cockroach
baseball league.

00:00:34,087 --> 00:00:36,591
...They're ready to invest
using their own money.

00:00:36,591 --> 00:00:38,695
Wow!
And they're willing
to fight each other

00:00:38,695 --> 00:00:39,864
for a piece of the action.

00:00:39,864 --> 00:00:41,166
I'd like to make you
an interesting offer.

00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,838
Robert's offer is effectively
radioactive waste.

00:00:43,838 --> 00:00:45,207
Oh, man.

00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:46,074
So, are you saying no?

00:00:46,074 --> 00:00:47,143
CUBAN: Hell, no.
Are you kidding?

00:00:47,143 --> 00:00:48,312
He's smarter than that.

00:00:48,312 --> 00:00:51,016
Robert, I want you and Lori
to work together.

00:00:51,016 --> 00:00:52,319
Hang on, my friend.
I can't do it.

00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:53,621
It would be a stupid move
for me.

00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:54,990
No, no,
you guys got to work it out.

00:00:56,393 --> 00:00:58,129
Wow!

00:00:58,129 --> 00:00:59,498
NARRATOR:
Who are the sharks?

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,038
They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors

00:01:04,038 --> 00:01:06,576
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.

00:01:06,576 --> 00:01:09,214
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist

00:01:09,214 --> 00:01:11,619
who turned a $10,000 loan

00:01:11,619 --> 00:01:16,260
into a software business
worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,731
Daymond John is
a fashion and branding expert

00:01:18,731 --> 00:01:20,768
who grew
his homemade clothing line

00:01:20,768 --> 00:01:24,007
into the globally recognized
fashion brand Fubu,

00:01:24,007 --> 00:01:27,413
with over $6 billion
in retail sales to date.

00:01:27,413 --> 00:01:30,752
Robert Herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,

00:01:30,752 --> 00:01:32,889
is now a technology mogul

00:01:32,889 --> 00:01:37,831
who sold his first internet
companies for over $350 million.

00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:40,235
Lori Greiner, the queen of QVC,

00:01:40,235 --> 00:01:44,242
holds over 100 patents and
has launched over 300 products,

00:01:44,242 --> 00:01:47,415
grossing over a half a billion
dollars in retail sales.

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:51,589
And Mark Cuban, notorious
billionaire entrepreneur,

00:01:51,589 --> 00:01:53,024
tech guru,

00:01:53,024 --> 00:01:56,029
and the outspoken owner
of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.

00:02:06,414 --> 00:02:07,415
My name is Thomas Hill.

00:02:07,415 --> 00:02:08,317
Come here, boo.

00:02:08,317 --> 00:02:09,720
I live in Anthem, Arizona,

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,224
with my wife, our daughter,
and our twin boys.

00:02:12,224 --> 00:02:14,194
Started playing football
in high school,

00:02:14,194 --> 00:02:16,431
and I quickly noticed
that that was my ticket

00:02:16,431 --> 00:02:18,434
out of the rough area
that I grew up in.

00:02:18,434 --> 00:02:19,637
Growing up was a struggle.

00:02:19,637 --> 00:02:21,072
My father was never around,

00:02:21,072 --> 00:02:23,510
and my brother and I
would watch our mom fight

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,913
to put food on the table.

00:02:24,913 --> 00:02:28,219
I had the opportunity to go
to Kansas State University,

00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:30,857
and I was selected
by the Green Bay Packers in 2004

00:02:30,857 --> 00:02:32,226
as a free-agent tight end.

00:02:32,226 --> 00:02:34,830
I had a college injury
that was hindering me,

00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,267
and it ultimately led
to me being released

00:02:37,267 --> 00:02:38,736
by the Green Bay Packers.

00:02:38,736 --> 00:02:40,139
Are you guys ready?!

00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:41,374
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!

00:02:41,374 --> 00:02:42,577
All right,
let's go, let's go, let's go!

00:02:42,577 --> 00:02:44,347
I wasn't about to let
being released by the NFL

00:02:44,347 --> 00:02:45,315
kill my dreams.

00:02:45,315 --> 00:02:46,985
I've taken
a unique business model,

00:02:46,985 --> 00:02:49,121
mixed it
with my athletic background,

00:02:49,121 --> 00:02:50,457
and created something

00:02:50,457 --> 00:02:53,295
that allows kids to have fun,
be fit, and stay engaged.

00:02:53,295 --> 00:02:54,097
Go, go, go!

00:02:54,097 --> 00:02:55,533
There's no doubt in my mind

00:02:55,533 --> 00:02:57,102
that the sharks are gonna love
my product.

00:02:57,102 --> 00:02:58,438
They're entrepreneurs
just like me,

00:02:58,438 --> 00:02:59,807
and I hope the sharks can see

00:02:59,807 --> 00:03:01,843
what my product can do
for all kids across the country

00:03:01,843 --> 00:03:02,878
and give me a deal.

00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:03,814
[ whistle blows ]

00:03:21,878 --> 00:03:24,616
Hello, sharks.
My name is Thomas Hill.

00:03:24,616 --> 00:03:27,822
I'm the founder and creator
of Bounce Boot Camp.

00:03:27,822 --> 00:03:29,425
I'm here seeking $30,000

00:03:29,425 --> 00:03:32,230
in exchange for 20% equity
in my company.

00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,999
Sharks,
we face a huge challenge today.

00:03:33,999 --> 00:03:35,602
1 in 3 children are obese,

00:03:35,602 --> 00:03:37,873
and that number
only continues to grow.

00:03:37,873 --> 00:03:41,045
But, sharks, we have a business
here that can change that.

00:03:41,045 --> 00:03:43,716
We have a unique system here
called Bounce Boot Camp.

00:03:43,716 --> 00:03:44,985
Bounce boot camp

00:03:44,985 --> 00:03:46,588
is the first and only
mobile company of its kind

00:03:46,588 --> 00:03:48,792
that combines the fun of
inflatable obstacle courses,

00:03:48,792 --> 00:03:52,365
slides, and castles, into a fun
fitness program for kids.

00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:53,967
How I came about this idea --

00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,670
my lovely daughter, Jada, here

00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,407
actually invited me to bounce in
a bounce-house castle with her

00:03:57,407 --> 00:03:58,542
one day.

00:03:58,542 --> 00:04:00,512
After bouncing
for roughly three minutes,

00:04:00,512 --> 00:04:02,348
I quickly found
my heart rate was up,

00:04:02,348 --> 00:04:04,586
my legs were burning,
I was sweating like crazy.

00:04:04,586 --> 00:04:07,257
I thought,
"Man, a fit guy like me?"
whoa.

00:04:07,257 --> 00:04:09,094
Right then, sharks, it hit me.

00:04:09,094 --> 00:04:10,396
How awesome would it be

00:04:10,396 --> 00:04:12,500
to create a fitness program
for kids

00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,703
all based around
using the inflatables?

00:04:14,703 --> 00:04:18,243
That night, sharks,
I created Bounce Boot Camp.

00:04:18,243 --> 00:04:20,279
These young junior generals
would like to show you

00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,548
that fitness really can be fun.

00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:23,085
Is that all right?
Yep.
Yeah.

00:04:23,085 --> 00:04:23,986
Awesome.
Are you guys ready?

00:04:23,986 --> 00:04:24,988
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!

00:04:24,988 --> 00:04:26,190
Sweet, let's do it!
Let's do it.

00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,259
Kira, you're right here
on the battle ropes.

00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:28,060
Andrew Morgan,
plank one position.

00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,395
Jada, you're in the squats.

00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:31,500
Here we go. Let's show 'em
how we make it look good.

00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,668
Ready, set, go!

00:04:32,668 --> 00:04:33,971
Come on, Andrew Morgan.
Get through there.

00:04:33,971 --> 00:04:35,707
Beat that ground up, Kira.

00:04:35,707 --> 00:04:37,309
Wow!
Beat that ground up.
Let's go, let's go.

00:04:37,309 --> 00:04:38,378
Dang.
Let's go.

00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:39,947
Yeah, let's go, Jada.
Get through there.

00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:41,350
Kira, give me the up-downs.
All right.

00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,519
Give me the up-downs, Kira.

00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:44,221
You didn't even know
you had abs, did you?

00:04:44,221 --> 00:04:45,223
[ laughs ]
That looks good right there.

00:04:45,223 --> 00:04:46,692
Come on, Jada, finish.

00:04:46,692 --> 00:04:49,364
Three...Two...One.
Oh, my God.
Look how long he's doing that.

00:04:49,364 --> 00:04:50,566
Ahh, great job, guys!

00:04:50,566 --> 00:04:51,835
That's what I'm talking about.
Good workout.

00:04:51,835 --> 00:04:53,037
Nicely done, guys.

00:04:53,037 --> 00:04:54,306
We can put a Bounce Boot Camp

00:04:54,306 --> 00:04:56,142
in every single city
across the country.

00:04:56,142 --> 00:04:57,511
Which one of you --
or all of you --

00:04:57,511 --> 00:04:59,481
are ready to help me
bounce out obesity?

00:04:59,481 --> 00:05:01,518
In fact, which one of you --
or a couple of you --

00:05:01,518 --> 00:05:02,687
would like to come down

00:05:02,687 --> 00:05:04,657
and have a little bit of fun
with fitness?

00:05:04,657 --> 00:05:07,128
There we go. Let's go.
You can take your jackets off.

00:05:07,128 --> 00:05:08,864
Come on, Rob.
This is you all day.

00:05:08,864 --> 00:05:09,899
All right, I want to try.
Come on.
Get in there.

00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:11,302
I want to see Daymond
do a plank.

00:05:11,302 --> 00:05:12,504
Right, I'm gonna have you
right here, Mr. Mark Cuban,

00:05:12,504 --> 00:05:13,806
in a plank one.
yes, sir.

00:05:13,806 --> 00:05:16,411
You're gonna race
this young gentleman to the end,

00:05:16,411 --> 00:05:18,047
touch the ground, and then
you're gonna come back.

00:05:18,047 --> 00:05:19,349
You want me to get through
that thing?

00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:20,618
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Get through there!

00:05:29,233 --> 00:05:31,070
Look at that.
He's already coming back.

00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,206
Where you at, Cuban?
Where you at, Mark Cuban?

00:05:33,206 --> 00:05:34,943
[ laughter ]

00:05:34,943 --> 00:05:38,215
Come on, Cuban.
You can do it, baby!

00:05:38,215 --> 00:05:39,851
Nicely done.
Nicely done, my man.

00:05:39,851 --> 00:05:41,020
Daymond, I'll take you.

00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,823
You guys are gonna be
in a plank one position.

00:05:42,823 --> 00:05:44,793
Plank. Come on, now.
Don't cheat. There we go.

00:05:44,793 --> 00:05:46,630

Get off me!

No cheating, no cheating.

00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:52,941
No cheating.
Go, Daymond.

00:05:52,941 --> 00:05:54,043

That was harder than it looked.

00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:02,891
It was.

00:06:02,891 --> 00:06:04,227
Great job, great job, great job.

boot camp dog tag like this.

Here we go.

00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,772
That was a lot of fun.

I think I ripped my trousers,
but I'm good.

CUBAN:
I want a rematch!

00:06:18,752 --> 00:06:20,488
Great job.
We can get that for you.

00:06:20,488 --> 00:06:22,091
Tom,
tell us about the business.

00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:24,462
How do you make money
with an inflatable boot camp?

00:06:24,462 --> 00:06:26,231
So, our company
is a mobile company.

00:06:26,231 --> 00:06:28,502
We have a 6x12 trailer.
It's a business in a box.

00:06:28,502 --> 00:06:29,471
So, you show up with the
trailer, you blow it up.

00:06:29,471 --> 00:06:30,807
We blow it up.

00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,211
Each camp has a different
configuration of inflatables,

00:06:33,211 --> 00:06:35,114
so one day you'll show up,
there's three.

00:06:35,114 --> 00:06:36,616
The next day you show up,
there's four or five.

00:06:36,616 --> 00:06:37,852
And how do you get the space
for the camp?

00:06:37,852 --> 00:06:40,090
We do it at schools, parks,
rec centers, gyms.

00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:42,426
We've even done it
on the large stadiums, as well.

00:06:42,426 --> 00:06:44,263
You have to pay rent
for that space?

00:06:44,263 --> 00:06:45,499
Absolutely.

00:06:45,499 --> 00:06:47,168
You have to pay for the rent
at some locations.

00:06:47,168 --> 00:06:48,270
How long is a class?

00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,906
Each class is 60 minutes.

00:06:49,906 --> 00:06:51,776
So, what we have
is a fitness camp.

00:06:51,776 --> 00:06:53,947
So, basically what happens
is kids sign up

00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:55,516
for either 8, 16, or 24 classes.

00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:58,221
They're $99 to $250,

00:06:58,221 --> 00:07:00,091
and they can earn
different-colored dog tags

00:07:00,091 --> 00:07:01,627
as they promote
through the ranks.

00:07:01,627 --> 00:07:04,298
So, it's kind of like karate,
but with Bounce Boot Camp,

00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,936
we have privates, captains,
sergeant, majors, colonels,

00:07:06,936 --> 00:07:08,272
and junior generals, as well.

00:07:08,272 --> 00:07:09,574
That's very cute.

00:07:09,574 --> 00:07:12,211
We want to actually license this
out across the country

00:07:12,211 --> 00:07:14,883
and put Bounce Boot Camps in
every single city and state.

00:07:14,883 --> 00:07:16,118
What's your background?

00:07:16,118 --> 00:07:17,454
My background is fitness.

00:07:17,454 --> 00:07:18,856
I'm a children's fitness
specialist.

00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:20,259
So, then, tell us
about the revenues.

00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:21,327
Great question.

00:07:21,327 --> 00:07:23,432
So, right now,
in 16 months of sales,

00:07:23,432 --> 00:07:24,834
we did $43,000 in sales.

00:07:26,537 --> 00:07:28,808
And that's working
one day a week.

00:07:28,808 --> 00:07:30,710
What about the last month,
Thomas?

00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,482
Is there a trending
month over month?

00:07:33,482 --> 00:07:35,519
So, the last month,
in our actual sales,

00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:37,422
we've roughly been
about 2,500 bucks.

00:07:37,422 --> 00:07:40,027
O'LEARY: Thomas, if I want to
set up mine in Boston,

00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:40,995
what does it cost?

00:07:40,995 --> 00:07:43,567
The business is $40,000, okay?

00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:44,936
Whoa.
It's $40,000.

00:07:44,936 --> 00:07:45,970
For us, it's $20,000 is the cost

00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,439
for all of the equipment,
the trailer.

00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:49,076
HERJAVEC: But you haven't sold
any yet, right?

00:07:49,076 --> 00:07:50,044
That is correct.

00:07:50,044 --> 00:07:51,848
It's an idea.
That is correct.

00:07:51,848 --> 00:07:53,851
And what I --
CUBAN: Thomas,
I love what you're doing,

00:07:53,851 --> 00:07:56,489
and I always respect
entrepreneurs -- their grind --

00:07:56,489 --> 00:07:58,493
because most don't have
the fortitude

00:07:58,493 --> 00:07:59,795
just to fight through it.

00:07:59,795 --> 00:08:00,963
Sure thing.
Right.

00:08:00,963 --> 00:08:02,466
So, you said you're working
still one day a week?

00:08:02,466 --> 00:08:03,567
Correct.

00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:04,336
What are you doing
the other six days?

00:08:04,336 --> 00:08:05,271
I do pharmaceutical sales.

00:08:05,271 --> 00:08:06,305
You've got
a full-time job.

00:08:06,305 --> 00:08:08,843
You have at least one daughter,
right?

00:08:08,843 --> 00:08:10,012
Right.
I do have twin boys.

00:08:10,012 --> 00:08:11,515
Okay, so you got three of 'em,
right?

00:08:11,515 --> 00:08:13,352
So you're caught in that
entrepreneur's dilemma.

00:08:13,352 --> 00:08:15,054
Do I keep my job
'cause I got bills to pay,

00:08:15,054 --> 00:08:16,590
or do I go for it?
right.

00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,861
And $30,000 is not enough
for you to go for it,

00:08:18,861 --> 00:08:21,699
and it's not enough for you
to really commit

00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:24,504
to doing something bigger
by hiring people.

00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,506
Right.

00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:26,875
And so because
you're in between,

00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,245
as much as I love the concept
and I respect what you're doing

00:08:29,245 --> 00:08:30,916
and just the effort
you've put in,

00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,685
I don't think
you're ready to be a business

00:08:32,685 --> 00:08:33,987
that takes on
an investor yet.

00:08:33,987 --> 00:08:35,390
And so for that reason,
I'm out.

00:08:38,461 --> 00:08:40,966
GREINER: You know what?

00:08:40,966 --> 00:08:42,268
I personally think

00:08:42,268 --> 00:08:45,106
really clever,
very creative, great idea.

00:08:45,106 --> 00:08:46,342
Thank you.

00:08:46,342 --> 00:08:49,581
What you should be doing
instead of thinking franchises

00:08:49,581 --> 00:08:52,152
is really making it
something solid, year-round,

00:08:52,152 --> 00:08:53,889
that works for you
in Arizona.

00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:55,525
But because
you're not there yet,

00:08:55,525 --> 00:08:58,230
I don't think there's something
to invest in at the moment.

00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,164
Okay. Okay.

00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,499
And so for that reason,
I'm out.

00:09:01,702 --> 00:09:04,006
Thomas, I think your business
model is flawed, okay?

00:09:04,006 --> 00:09:05,575
I don't think
this is gonna work.

00:09:05,575 --> 00:09:07,278
Might as well get the truth
from me.

00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:08,547
That's why they call me
Mr. Wonderful.

00:09:08,547 --> 00:09:09,916
I'd love to hear
what you have to say about it.

00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,085
That's not true.
But here's the problem.

00:09:11,085 --> 00:09:13,956
You're gonna try and sell me
this for $40,000.

00:09:13,956 --> 00:09:15,158
The guy next door to me

00:09:15,158 --> 00:09:16,628
doesn't have to pay that much
to buy the same thing.

00:09:16,628 --> 00:09:17,663
There's nothing proprietary
about this.

00:09:17,663 --> 00:09:18,832
I disagree with that.

00:09:18,832 --> 00:09:20,869
It takes time to put
this program together,

00:09:20,869 --> 00:09:22,572
and that's exactly
what I've done.

00:09:22,572 --> 00:09:25,010
So when you say it's flawed, I
disagree with you, respectfully.

00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:26,679
Had you sold 10 of them
already

00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,715
and convinced people
to pay you $40,000,

00:09:28,715 --> 00:09:30,786
that would have been
more impressive to me.

00:09:30,786 --> 00:09:32,122
I want the proof,
my friend.

00:09:32,122 --> 00:09:33,557
You don't have it.
I'm out.

00:09:33,557 --> 00:09:34,926
I appreciate that.

00:09:34,926 --> 00:09:38,098
Thomas, I just think
it's a little too soon.

00:09:38,098 --> 00:09:41,905
Before you go out,
this is a start-up,

00:09:41,905 --> 00:09:44,777
and how great would it be to be
able to be in the ground floor?

00:09:44,777 --> 00:09:47,248
And I'm not asking
for a large investment.

00:09:47,248 --> 00:09:48,216
I'm really not.

00:09:48,216 --> 00:09:49,552
I'm asking for $30,000.

00:09:49,552 --> 00:09:51,255
That's not
a very large investment.

00:09:51,255 --> 00:09:53,959
I'm asking for a little bit of
time, a little bit of patience,

00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:54,828
and I'll do the work.

00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:56,297
I'm not asking you to work.

00:09:56,297 --> 00:09:58,334
I don't need any of you to step
outside of what you do right now

00:09:58,334 --> 00:09:59,669
and work for me.

00:09:59,669 --> 00:10:01,506
That's not why I'm here.

00:10:04,211 --> 00:10:06,982
I respect
how hard you're working.

00:10:09,386 --> 00:10:13,493
But I don't see how I can invest
today to help grow my money.

00:10:13,493 --> 00:10:15,997
I wish you all the best,
my friend.

00:10:15,997 --> 00:10:17,100
I'm out.

00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,802
JOHN: Tom, we have to be honest
with you.

00:10:18,802 --> 00:10:20,405
You know,
you have a noble cause.

00:10:20,405 --> 00:10:22,075
You're getting kids
off the couch.

00:10:22,075 --> 00:10:24,345
I don't know when the last time
I heard a kid say,

00:10:24,345 --> 00:10:26,015
"I'm gonna go out in the street
and play football."

00:10:26,015 --> 00:10:27,251
absolutely.

00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:30,890
But at this point,
the business model doesn't work.

00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,526
I have to be out.

00:10:32,526 --> 00:10:35,632
Oh, man.
Man.

00:10:35,632 --> 00:10:38,270
Thomas, you got all
the best advice in the world.

00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,407
Just take that advice
and run with it.

00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:42,477
No, you're right.
You're right, absolutely.

00:10:42,477 --> 00:10:43,278
Good luck, man.

00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:44,180
Thanks for the opportunity.

00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,349
I'll be back.

00:10:45,349 --> 00:10:46,684
Thank you, guys.

00:10:48,287 --> 00:10:49,589
O'LEARY:
It's too expensive.

00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:51,894
You could buy one of those
for $3,000 more than --

00:10:51,894 --> 00:10:54,398
he knows that the franchise
model hasn't worked out yet.

00:10:54,398 --> 00:10:55,566
Look, the guy's
a great entrepreneur.

00:10:55,566 --> 00:10:56,535
He's just got to go out there
and hustle.

00:10:56,535 --> 00:10:58,204
I didn't see anybody write
a check.

00:10:58,204 --> 00:10:59,473
We'll be back.

00:10:59,473 --> 00:11:00,708
We're still gonna try to fight
childhood obesity,

00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,879
and we're still gonna grow
Bounce Boot Camp

00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:03,948
into a big brand.

00:11:03,948 --> 00:11:05,717
So, hey, you win some,
you lose some.

00:11:05,717 --> 00:11:07,822
I still feel like we won.

00:11:15,734 --> 00:11:18,406
NARRATOR: Next up
is a forensic pathologist

00:11:18,406 --> 00:11:21,244
with a prescription
for a common household malady.

00:11:28,257 --> 00:11:30,460
Hello, sharks.
My name is Jim Lewis.

00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,731
I'm from Chester County,
Pennsylvania,

00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:36,638
and my company's name
is the Wall Doctor Rx.

00:11:36,638 --> 00:11:41,312
Sharks, I'm asking for $150,000
for 10% equity of my business.

00:11:41,312 --> 00:11:44,217
Sharks, I'm a wall-ologist,
a doctor of walls.

00:11:44,217 --> 00:11:47,156
And I've created one of the
greatest products in the world,

00:11:47,156 --> 00:11:48,391
Wall Rx.

00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:50,128
But, look, enough talk.

00:11:50,128 --> 00:11:51,931
Let's see what I've got.

00:11:51,931 --> 00:11:53,667
First, you need a hole.

00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:54,402
[ laughs ]

00:11:54,402 --> 00:11:55,404
[ laughs ]

00:11:55,404 --> 00:11:58,776
Now, in order to fix that hole,

00:11:58,776 --> 00:12:02,416
you need all of this...

00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,486
And all of this.

00:12:04,486 --> 00:12:07,024
Oh, and don't forget this.

00:12:07,024 --> 00:12:09,395
Dry as a bone.
Spackle.

00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,266
Or you simply need this --
wall rx.

00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:14,203
Let's see how it works.

00:12:14,203 --> 00:12:18,778
First, like any good surgeon,
let us prepare the surface.

00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:20,080
Surface prepped.

00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,749
[ laughter ]

00:12:22,585 --> 00:12:28,094
Now, take your disc
and place it over your hole.

00:12:29,296 --> 00:12:34,806
Now, take your frame
with your special compound

00:12:34,806 --> 00:12:37,944
and place it over the disk.

00:12:37,944 --> 00:12:41,985
Press and spread
to desired smoothness.

00:12:41,985 --> 00:12:43,621
Done.

00:12:43,621 --> 00:12:48,596
In 24 to 48 hours,
it will look like this.

00:12:48,596 --> 00:12:51,267
Remove your frame.

00:12:51,267 --> 00:12:53,371
Huh.
Wow.

00:12:53,371 --> 00:12:54,339
And sand.

00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:55,375
Oh, you have to sand it?

00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,647
No tools, no skills,
and no mess.

00:12:58,647 --> 00:13:00,951
Now, who wants to come up
and give it a try?

00:13:00,951 --> 00:13:02,186
I want to touch it.

00:13:02,186 --> 00:13:03,856
Want to knock a hole
in the wall, Lori,

00:13:03,856 --> 00:13:05,425
or you want to just touch it?

00:13:05,425 --> 00:13:06,962
Yeah.
I'm gonna do both.

00:13:06,962 --> 00:13:08,865
Please do.
Okay.

00:13:08,865 --> 00:13:10,701
I would hit it right there.

00:13:10,701 --> 00:13:11,903
There you go.
JOHN: There you go.

00:13:11,903 --> 00:13:12,938
Okay.

00:13:12,938 --> 00:13:14,608
Now, take your disc.

00:13:14,608 --> 00:13:17,513
Pull the paper
from your disc.
Okay.

00:13:17,513 --> 00:13:20,619
Place it over the hole.

00:13:20,619 --> 00:13:22,321
Now take
your special compound.

00:13:22,321 --> 00:13:24,391
Okay.

00:13:24,391 --> 00:13:26,028
And place it
over the disc.

00:13:26,028 --> 00:13:27,163
Press.

00:13:27,163 --> 00:13:29,033
Easy.
Done. That's it.

00:13:29,033 --> 00:13:30,502
Pretty cool.

00:13:30,502 --> 00:13:33,708
Wall doctor,
what happens if the hole
is four inches in diameter?

00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,912
Oh, Mr. Wonderful,
that's a great --

00:13:35,912 --> 00:13:37,314
that's a great question.

00:13:38,516 --> 00:13:41,922
You get
the four-inch hole repair.

00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:44,526
HERJAVEC:
I've never -- I've never seen
a product like this,

00:13:44,526 --> 00:13:45,962
so what's proprietary
about it?

00:13:45,962 --> 00:13:48,333
Is it the compound
that you put together?

00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,337
We have three full patents
on it.

00:13:50,337 --> 00:13:51,973
Jim, are you --
are you an engineer?

00:13:51,973 --> 00:13:53,375
Are you a chemist?
Are you a doctor?

00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,911
Oh, no, I'm a real doctor.

00:13:54,911 --> 00:13:56,380
I'm a forensic pathologist.

00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,451
So, Jim, for a living,
you see dead people.

00:13:58,451 --> 00:13:59,920
I do.
All right.

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,556
So, Jim,
let me ask you something.

00:14:01,556 --> 00:14:03,192
Three years ago,
you created this?

00:14:03,192 --> 00:14:04,595
Three years ago.

00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:05,764
So, what are your sales?

00:14:05,764 --> 00:14:07,199
Right now, I've sold a couple.

00:14:08,902 --> 00:14:11,140
Uh, we sold 80,000.

00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,909
Okay.
That's not a couple.

00:14:12,909 --> 00:14:15,647
What is your gross sales?

00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:17,851
Our gross sales was $600,000.

00:14:17,851 --> 00:14:20,122
Oh.
Wow!

00:14:20,122 --> 00:14:22,860
Jim, do they have a projection
for next year?

00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,263
Between a half million
to a million.

00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:25,498
Whoa.

00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,403
But I realize,
you can drown in success.

00:14:28,403 --> 00:14:29,672
I've had people come to us

00:14:29,672 --> 00:14:31,742
and asking us to put it
in their stores.

00:14:31,742 --> 00:14:35,048
Matter of fact, I just met with
the largest retailer on Earth,

00:14:35,048 --> 00:14:36,116
and they want it.

00:14:36,116 --> 00:14:38,120
And I told 'em,
"I can't do it this year

00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,023
because I don't have
enough capital."

00:14:40,023 --> 00:14:42,127
I've got to automate
my process more,

00:14:42,127 --> 00:14:44,932
and if I did it, I would
just take all my inventory.

00:14:44,932 --> 00:14:46,634
I would just be -- I would fail.

00:14:46,634 --> 00:14:47,903
What does it sell for?

00:14:47,903 --> 00:14:49,005
We don't even know.

00:14:49,005 --> 00:14:51,008
They're selling
between $6.99 and $9.99.

00:14:51,008 --> 00:14:52,745
And what does it cost you
to make?

00:14:52,745 --> 00:14:54,882
$2.50 -- $2 to $2.50.

00:14:54,882 --> 00:14:56,218
What are you gonna use
the money for?

00:14:56,218 --> 00:14:58,021
We're gonna take all the money

00:14:58,021 --> 00:15:01,327
and use it for buying machinery
to automate our process.

00:15:01,327 --> 00:15:03,664
'cause you're a doctor.
Do you still practice?

00:15:03,664 --> 00:15:05,300
I have two full-time jobs.

00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,339
Wall doctor
and regular doctor.

00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:09,808
That's pretty hard to do,
doctor.

00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:10,776
I mean, think about it.

00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,246
If you're gonna grow
this company

00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:14,283
and start servicing
the largest retailer on Earth,

00:15:14,283 --> 00:15:15,351
either you're gonna do it,

00:15:15,351 --> 00:15:17,021
or you're gonna hire
somebody else to do it.

00:15:17,021 --> 00:15:20,159
You understand, when you jump
into the big leagues,

00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:22,397
you have to build a real company
to support that.

00:15:22,397 --> 00:15:23,565
Absolutely.

00:15:23,565 --> 00:15:25,335
I'd like to make you
an interesting offer.

00:15:26,571 --> 00:15:29,643
I have a lot of connections
internationally in this space,

00:15:29,643 --> 00:15:34,551
so I'll give you the $150,000,
no equity.

00:15:34,551 --> 00:15:37,122
You can keep
the United States sales.

00:15:37,122 --> 00:15:40,228
You give me exclusive rights
for this product,

00:15:40,228 --> 00:15:43,366
whatever you sell it for today,
to Lowe's --

00:15:43,366 --> 00:15:45,470
let's say
you're selling at $2.

00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,806
I'll buy it at $2 from you

00:15:46,806 --> 00:15:48,809
and sell it
to the rest of the world.

00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:50,880
Wow.

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,449
Doctor,
I'll make you an offer.

00:15:53,851 --> 00:15:58,292
I'll give you $150,000
for 15%.

00:15:58,292 --> 00:15:59,661
With one contingency.

00:15:59,661 --> 00:16:01,932
I want to license
this technology.

00:16:01,932 --> 00:16:04,770
I want to give it to a company
that's global,

00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:07,208
that has distribution,
manufacturing,

00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,477
and handles
all the logistics.

00:16:08,477 --> 00:16:12,350
You stay being a doctor,
and you get a check every month.

00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:15,456
You're on the cusp
of a huge business.

00:16:15,456 --> 00:16:17,459
Do you want to be
filthy rich,

00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:20,063
or do you want to actually sell
packages of tape?

00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:21,332
Which is it?

00:16:21,332 --> 00:16:23,236
Oh, I want to be filthy rich
like everyone else.

00:16:23,236 --> 00:16:24,572
Ahh,
now you're my kind of guy.

00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:29,613
I like Kevin's offer.
My offer's just like Kevin's.

00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:34,155
I want to outsource
manufacturing and license it,

00:16:34,155 --> 00:16:35,657
except I'm gonna give you
twice the money.

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,532
Thank you, Daymond.
Thank you so much.

00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:44,940
My offer is $300,000,
twice what you asked for,

00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,912
for 20% equity.

00:16:47,912 --> 00:16:50,950
We will take it
right to QVC,

00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,722
and right to
an infomercial spot,

00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:57,128
because that's where I think
you will make this brand

00:16:57,128 --> 00:17:01,669
and this product known globally
with lightning speed.

00:17:01,669 --> 00:17:02,571
Whoa.

00:17:02,571 --> 00:17:04,841
Whoa, this is, uh...

00:17:04,841 --> 00:17:06,310
Wow.

00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,648
Those are your options.
What is your decision?

00:17:20,302 --> 00:17:22,806
NARRATOR: Jim has four offers
on the table.

00:17:22,806 --> 00:17:25,343
Robert has offered $150,000
for zero equity,

00:17:25,343 --> 00:17:27,380
but he wants
the exclusive rights

00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,551
to sell the product
internationally.

00:17:29,551 --> 00:17:33,658
Kevin has offered $150,000
for 15% of the company,

00:17:33,658 --> 00:17:35,795
contingent on
licensing the product

00:17:35,795 --> 00:17:38,533
to outsource all manufacturing
and distribution.

00:17:38,533 --> 00:17:41,004
Daymond has the same contingency
as Kevin,

00:17:41,004 --> 00:17:44,677
but has offered $300,000
for 15%,

00:17:44,677 --> 00:17:48,416
and Lori has offered $300,000
but for 20% of the company.

00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,888
Those are your options.
What is your decision?

00:17:50,888 --> 00:17:53,259
Now I know why they call you
sharks and not guppies.

00:17:55,897 --> 00:17:58,968
Well, I'm thinking,
I like your deal, Robert,

00:17:58,968 --> 00:18:02,408
because the rest of the world
can be taken care of,

00:18:02,408 --> 00:18:05,180
and I don't have a problem
with that.

00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,549
Robert takes a platform

00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:09,854
that we all are interested
in taking advantage of, as well.

00:18:09,854 --> 00:18:13,093
O'LEARY: When I go to a global
manufacturer, distributor,

00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,396
logistics company,

00:18:14,396 --> 00:18:17,467
they don't want to see
any territory excluded.

00:18:17,467 --> 00:18:20,172
GREINER: And when I go to
an infomercial company,

00:18:20,172 --> 00:18:23,344
they want to have
all possibilities open to them.

00:18:23,344 --> 00:18:24,580
They want to go global.

00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,817
So Robert's offer is effectively
radioactive waste.

00:18:26,817 --> 00:18:30,056
We have not heard
from Mr. Cuban yet.

00:18:30,056 --> 00:18:32,493
CUBAN: Daymond says
he's the people's advocate.

00:18:32,493 --> 00:18:34,831
I'm the entrepreneur's advocate,
so I'm gonna go out,

00:18:34,831 --> 00:18:37,703
and I'm here to answer
any questions, but I'm out.

00:18:37,703 --> 00:18:40,474
Okay.

00:18:44,715 --> 00:18:49,423
Robert, I want you and Lori
to work together.

00:18:54,966 --> 00:18:56,836
Robert,
your deal is phenomenal.

00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:58,839
I need you two
to work together.

00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:00,709
Doc, I love you, but --

00:19:00,709 --> 00:19:02,379
please, please, you got to come
together with this, please.

00:19:02,379 --> 00:19:04,181
I just --
I love you, but...

00:19:04,181 --> 00:19:05,350
My wife would kill me
if I said no to you,

00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,087
and my wife would kill me
if I said no to you,

00:19:07,087 --> 00:19:08,657
so you've got to come together
with this.

00:19:08,657 --> 00:19:09,692
Please --

00:19:09,692 --> 00:19:10,793
so, are you saying no
to Kevin and I?

00:19:13,231 --> 00:19:14,333
I -- yes.

00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,804
Don't say
that you're dead to me.

00:19:16,804 --> 00:19:19,809
I would love to have you and you
together.

00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:21,645
We know you want that.

00:19:21,645 --> 00:19:23,482
I want that.
But --

00:19:23,482 --> 00:19:24,283
so, now, now,
you guys got to work it out.

00:19:24,283 --> 00:19:25,285
You've got to work it out.

00:19:25,285 --> 00:19:26,554
Somebody's got to --

00:19:26,554 --> 00:19:27,756
I can't do it. it would be
a stupid move for me.

00:19:27,756 --> 00:19:30,528
I have in my mind
what I know

00:19:30,528 --> 00:19:32,597
will be the successful
marketing structure for you.

00:19:32,597 --> 00:19:35,102
I need to bring it
to my infomercial partners,

00:19:35,102 --> 00:19:36,772
and they have to have
global rights.

00:19:36,772 --> 00:19:38,909
Understood.

00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:41,513
Was your counter to give us
some equity into it?

00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,718
The counter was to get you
two together,

00:19:43,718 --> 00:19:46,088
and what do I need to get you
two together?

00:19:46,088 --> 00:19:48,492
Doctor, they don't want to work
together.

00:19:50,261 --> 00:19:52,332
Robert...

00:19:52,332 --> 00:19:53,267
We got a deal.

00:19:53,267 --> 00:19:54,370
No, no, no, no.

00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,840
Now, wait.
Don't change your mind now.

00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,376
Hang on, my friend.
Oh, Doc!

00:19:58,376 --> 00:19:59,211
Hang on, my friend.

00:19:59,211 --> 00:20:00,847
What?
Hang on, my friend.

00:20:00,847 --> 00:20:01,782
Whoa.

00:20:03,819 --> 00:20:08,193
I don't want to be your cousin
at the dance.

00:20:08,193 --> 00:20:10,798
My offer didn't change
all the way through,

00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:13,936
but you countered that
you only wanted to take my deal

00:20:13,936 --> 00:20:15,406
if you got Lori into it.

00:20:15,406 --> 00:20:18,444
Honestly, Robert,
are you declining?

00:20:18,444 --> 00:20:21,583
Don't -- now, don't --
please don't decline.

00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:22,852
Please, please stay in the deal,
please.

00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,456
Will you take the deal?

00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:32,302
[ sighs ]
You know, let's do it.

00:20:32,302 --> 00:20:33,771
I'm there. Let's do it.

00:20:33,771 --> 00:20:34,705
I'm there, man.

00:20:34,705 --> 00:20:35,674
Do I hear a yes?

00:20:35,674 --> 00:20:36,543
Yes!

00:20:36,543 --> 00:20:37,610
Can I get a "yes"?

00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:38,712
Robert,
he said yes before!

00:20:38,712 --> 00:20:39,681
All right.

00:20:39,681 --> 00:20:41,217
Man, this is great.

00:20:41,217 --> 00:20:42,386
Thank you so much.

00:20:42,386 --> 00:20:45,124
It was a little confusing there
for a while.

00:20:45,124 --> 00:20:45,959
No, no, no.

00:20:45,959 --> 00:20:47,295
To nobody but you, Robert.

00:20:47,295 --> 00:20:50,099
One other thing,
you are dead to me.

00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:51,167
[ laughs ]

00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:54,740
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.

00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,243
Look,
I think he's very clever.

00:20:56,243 --> 00:20:57,946
A lot of entrepreneurs
don't realize,

00:20:57,946 --> 00:20:59,749
there's other markets
around the world.

00:20:59,749 --> 00:21:01,085
This lets him focus
on what he has.

00:21:01,085 --> 00:21:02,287
I don't think
that was clever.

00:21:02,287 --> 00:21:03,656
Yeah!

00:21:03,656 --> 00:21:06,328
I was trying to do something
to get her in on the deal,

00:21:06,328 --> 00:21:09,266
whatever it took
for those two to work together.

00:21:09,266 --> 00:21:11,770
That one could have been,
like, Batman and Robin.

00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,507
We could have had
United States covered

00:21:13,507 --> 00:21:14,642
and the rest of the world.

00:21:14,642 --> 00:21:15,911
I'm heartbroken,

00:21:15,911 --> 00:21:17,647
but my heart was mended

00:21:17,647 --> 00:21:20,452
when Robert said,
yes, we had a deal.

00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:27,564
NARRATOR: Last season,
three friends from Rhode Island

00:21:27,564 --> 00:21:29,066
made a deal with Robert and Mark

00:21:29,066 --> 00:21:31,471
for their high-protein
nut Butters, Nuts 'N More.

00:21:31,471 --> 00:21:33,040
You guys got a deal.
All right.

00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,075
[ applause ]

00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:36,713
NARRATOR:
Let's see how they're doing now.

00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:37,916
Morning, LeAnn.

00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:40,220
Since "Shark Tank,"
business has been nuts.

00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,087
And more.

00:21:41,087 --> 00:21:42,691
Prior to "Shark Tank,"

00:21:42,691 --> 00:21:45,362
we had $100,000 in sales
in 5 months.

00:21:45,362 --> 00:21:49,636
7 months later, we have exceeded
$1 million in sales.

00:21:49,636 --> 00:21:51,940
We were doing $2,500 a week.

00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,977
Now we're doing $2,500 a day.

00:21:53,977 --> 00:21:56,648
That's
a lot of peanut butter.

00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,951
As Rhode Islanders,

00:21:57,951 --> 00:22:00,855
we have a great opportunity
to create local jobs.

00:22:00,855 --> 00:22:03,360
Manufacturing has been gone
for a long time in this state,

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,662
but we're bringing it back.

00:22:04,662 --> 00:22:06,832
We've grown
to over 12 employees,

00:22:06,832 --> 00:22:08,436
expanded to a 10,000-square foot

00:22:08,436 --> 00:22:10,572
state-of-the-art
manufacturing facility,

00:22:10,572 --> 00:22:11,874
and have been picked up

00:22:11,874 --> 00:22:14,045
by two of the nation's
top supplement distributors.

00:22:14,045 --> 00:22:15,815
Mark and Robert
have been fantastic.

00:22:15,815 --> 00:22:18,920
They have been great mentors in
helping us build our business.

00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,289
Robert recently visited us

00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:22,827
at the largest fitness
trade show in the country.

00:22:22,827 --> 00:22:24,697
Having him there,
showing his support,

00:22:24,697 --> 00:22:26,767
was such an unbelievable feeling
for us.

00:22:26,767 --> 00:22:28,103
Come on, guys.

00:22:28,103 --> 00:22:30,040
We got 230 orders to get done
by the end of the day.

00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,274
Let's go!

00:22:31,274 --> 00:22:32,878
Before "Shark Tank,"
we were only in 32 stores.

00:22:32,878 --> 00:22:34,748
Now we're in over 600 stores,

00:22:34,748 --> 00:22:37,085
and we just locked in
Whole Foods.

00:22:37,085 --> 00:22:40,424
We're looking at being
in over 32,000 stores.

00:22:40,424 --> 00:22:44,631
We're projecting $5 million
to $6 million in the next year.

00:22:44,631 --> 00:22:47,202
Having the opportunity
to be your own boss

00:22:47,202 --> 00:22:50,342
and run your own company
is everything we ever wanted.

00:22:50,342 --> 00:22:52,578
"Shark Tank" has really made
our dreams come true.

00:22:52,578 --> 00:22:54,214
ALL: Nuts 'N More!

00:22:54,214 --> 00:22:55,383
[ cheering ]

00:23:01,728 --> 00:23:04,099
NARRATOR:
Next up is an entrepreneur

00:23:04,099 --> 00:23:05,501
from Washington, D.C.,

00:23:05,501 --> 00:23:08,073
with his answer to a nationwide
security problem.

00:23:15,819 --> 00:23:17,088
Hello, sharks.

00:23:17,088 --> 00:23:18,925
My name is C.J. Isakow

00:23:18,925 --> 00:23:21,529
from our nation's capital,
Washington, D.C.

00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:22,932
My company is eyebloc,

00:23:22,932 --> 00:23:25,903
and I'm seeking $50,000
for 10% of my company,

00:23:25,903 --> 00:23:29,242
because, sharks,
Americans are being watched!

00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,715
They're watching you
with cameras

00:23:32,715 --> 00:23:34,084
that are already in your home,

00:23:34,084 --> 00:23:38,425
in your office, in your school,
even in your bedroom.

00:23:38,425 --> 00:23:41,063
They're watching you
through your computer.

00:23:41,063 --> 00:23:42,198
That's right.

00:23:42,198 --> 00:23:44,301
People can remotely access
your computer

00:23:44,301 --> 00:23:46,405
and watch you
through this camera.

00:23:46,405 --> 00:23:47,341
Don't believe me?

00:23:47,341 --> 00:23:48,743
Robert,
you're in I.T. security.

00:23:48,743 --> 00:23:49,778
You can vouch for this.

00:23:49,778 --> 00:23:50,746
Absolutely true.

00:23:50,746 --> 00:23:51,715
Absolutely true.

00:23:51,715 --> 00:23:53,084
Even the most modest of hackers

00:23:53,084 --> 00:23:55,254
can take over your laptop
and control the camera.

00:23:55,254 --> 00:23:57,558
For proof,
just turn on the evening news.

00:23:57,558 --> 00:23:59,161
There's beauty queens
being blackmailed.

00:23:59,161 --> 00:24:01,698
Some creep was taking pictures
of her in her bedroom

00:24:01,698 --> 00:24:04,303
in her most private moments
and was blackmailing her.

00:24:04,303 --> 00:24:06,841
Even our own government
is overstepping their bounds.

00:24:06,841 --> 00:24:09,746
Sharks, I love my country.

00:24:09,746 --> 00:24:10,848
I love our freedom!

00:24:10,848 --> 00:24:13,719
And this violates
America's very core,

00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:14,988
but don't worry.

00:24:14,988 --> 00:24:16,791
There's a solution, sharks.

00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:20,398
Eyebloc,
the webcam privacy shield.

00:24:21,233 --> 00:24:24,071
Designed to fit any device
and cover the camera,

00:24:24,071 --> 00:24:25,841
ensuring no one can spy on you.

00:24:25,841 --> 00:24:27,376
Let me show you how it works.

00:24:27,376 --> 00:24:30,014
Let's say some hacker's gotten
into your computer,

00:24:30,014 --> 00:24:31,250
and he's watching you.

00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,819
It's really sick.
But guess what.

00:24:32,819 --> 00:24:33,988
He's watching you,

00:24:33,988 --> 00:24:35,724
taking a little too much
interest in your home,

00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,995
and then...boom!

00:24:37,995 --> 00:24:39,197
Eyebloc'd!
Amazing!

00:24:39,197 --> 00:24:40,700
Boom goes the dynamite!
Amazing!

00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,603
You want to see it again?
Did you catch it?

00:24:42,603 --> 00:24:43,371
Did we catch it?

00:24:43,371 --> 00:24:44,073
Boom!

00:24:44,073 --> 00:24:45,508
Oh!
Eyebloc'd!

00:24:45,508 --> 00:24:48,547
So, which one of you sharks
is ready to step up,

00:24:48,547 --> 00:24:51,819
protect America --
actually, protect the world --

00:24:51,819 --> 00:24:54,056
and take a bite
out of cybercrime?

00:24:54,892 --> 00:24:56,327
[ laughs ]

00:24:56,327 --> 00:25:00,501
Robert,
how big a problem is this?

00:25:00,501 --> 00:25:01,502
Yeah, is that true?

00:25:01,502 --> 00:25:03,106
Absolutely.
It happens all the time.

00:25:03,106 --> 00:25:05,376
It's very difficult
to turn it off

00:25:05,376 --> 00:25:06,945
for the average consumer.

00:25:06,945 --> 00:25:09,383
C.J., you want me
to give you $50,000

00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:10,685
for that little piece of crap?

00:25:10,685 --> 00:25:12,455
Yeah.
[ laughs ]

00:25:12,455 --> 00:25:14,191
let me ask you a question.
how many of you guys
have ever been naked

00:25:14,191 --> 00:25:15,928
in front of your computer,
raise your hand?

00:25:15,928 --> 00:25:17,797
Wait a minute.
ISAKOW: Have you ever been naked
in front of your computer?

00:25:17,797 --> 00:25:19,066
GREINER: Daily.
Yes or no, Mr. Wonderful?

00:25:19,066 --> 00:25:20,001
[ laughs ]

00:25:20,001 --> 00:25:21,637
So, tell us about the business,
C.J.

00:25:21,637 --> 00:25:22,706
We're a new business.

00:25:22,706 --> 00:25:24,175
We're very, you know,
rapid growth.

00:25:24,175 --> 00:25:26,146
Two months ago,
this thing didn't exist,

00:25:26,146 --> 00:25:28,750
and now I'm getting orders
from people in the military.

00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:31,388
I'm getting --
so, how much has
the total orders have been?

00:25:32,824 --> 00:25:33,491
45.

00:25:35,261 --> 00:25:36,396
Wait, 45 units?

00:25:36,396 --> 00:25:38,534
45 --
45,000?

00:25:38,534 --> 00:25:40,537
No. Come on.
You said fast-growing company.

00:25:40,537 --> 00:25:43,241
So far,
I'm averaging about one a day.

00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:44,677
Wow!
It could double to two a day.

00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:45,679
Come on.
[ laughs ]

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:46,815
what if it went to three a day?

00:25:46,815 --> 00:25:48,284
How much are you selling it for,
C.J.?

00:25:48,284 --> 00:25:49,987
Great question. $9.99.

00:25:49,987 --> 00:25:51,022
$9.99?

00:25:51,022 --> 00:25:51,991
[ laughs ]

00:25:51,991 --> 00:25:53,293
Plus $4
shipping and handling.

00:25:53,293 --> 00:25:54,361
I'm making 10 bucks.

00:25:54,361 --> 00:25:56,098
I've sold over $600 worth
on Amazon.

00:25:56,098 --> 00:25:56,898
Wow!

00:25:58,034 --> 00:26:00,705
C.J., you know why
it's only been 45 units?

00:26:00,705 --> 00:26:01,941
'cause I could take
a piece of gum --

00:26:01,941 --> 00:26:02,943
I could take
a post-it note.

00:26:02,943 --> 00:26:04,112
You're right.

00:26:04,112 --> 00:26:05,414
I could take anything
and just pop it over there.

00:26:05,414 --> 00:26:06,649
Mark, you're right.

00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:08,719
This is my competition
right here, right here.

00:26:08,719 --> 00:26:09,788
Do you want this?

00:26:09,788 --> 00:26:11,057
Do you want this
all over your laptop?

00:26:11,057 --> 00:26:12,860
You put it on your laptop,
you forget about it.

00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,362
You're unprotected again.
You know what?

00:26:14,362 --> 00:26:15,598
I'm not gonna lose
post-it notes.

00:26:15,598 --> 00:26:16,933
There are always
gonna be more.

00:26:16,933 --> 00:26:18,736
That thing, I'm gonna lose.
Let me show it to you, Mark.

00:26:18,736 --> 00:26:20,473
Let me show you,
'cause it's really high quality.

00:26:21,475 --> 00:26:22,911
Yeah, hand 'em out, C.J.,
please.

00:26:25,314 --> 00:26:26,583
Red, white, and blue.

00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:27,452
I'll go blue.

00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:28,687
I'll go white.
Thank you.

00:26:30,457 --> 00:26:31,959
ISAKOW:
Don't lose those.

00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:33,830
I've already sold those
on Amazon.

00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,931
[ laughs ]
So --

00:26:34,931 --> 00:26:35,966
I like this guy.

00:26:35,966 --> 00:26:37,069
Here's the thing.

00:26:37,069 --> 00:26:39,339
I invested 5 grand
in an aluminum mold

00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:41,509
so I can get them priced down
to $1.25.

00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:44,816
A steel mold, and that's part of
what I want the investment for,

00:26:44,816 --> 00:26:47,152
will get the price down
to under 25 cents.

00:26:47,152 --> 00:26:48,589
So, if you see on the back
is our logo,

00:26:48,589 --> 00:26:50,058
and it'll be more prominent
in the mold.

00:26:50,058 --> 00:26:51,360
You could use it
as home plate

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,763
in your cockroach
baseball league.

00:26:52,763 --> 00:26:54,499
[ laughs ]
Cockroach baseball league.

00:26:54,499 --> 00:26:55,768
It looks like home plate.

00:26:55,768 --> 00:27:00,042
I have a huge problem
with one thing -- the price.

00:27:00,042 --> 00:27:03,280
You said you were selling this
for $9.99?

00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,516
Yeah.

00:27:04,516 --> 00:27:07,922
Honestly,
this, to me, a buck.

00:27:09,091 --> 00:27:10,760
I'm sorry
to crush your dreams.

00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,630
Think about car alarms
in the 1980s.

00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,099
Car alarms in the 1980s,

00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:15,435
everyone bought car alarms to
keep people out of their cars.

00:27:15,435 --> 00:27:16,670
Everyone's
gonna be buying eyeblocs

00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,741
to keep them
out of their private lives.

00:27:18,741 --> 00:27:20,978
I know, but I think
that they can also think

00:27:20,978 --> 00:27:23,349
of a million other ways
to also put a block on.

00:27:23,349 --> 00:27:25,653
And for that reason,
I'm out.

00:27:27,756 --> 00:27:30,294
C.J., there's definitely
a market

00:27:30,294 --> 00:27:33,734
to protect kids, especially,
from their webcams.

00:27:33,734 --> 00:27:35,069
Yeah, absolutely.

00:27:35,069 --> 00:27:37,106
I don't think this is it.

00:27:37,106 --> 00:27:37,974
I'm out.

00:27:37,974 --> 00:27:39,277
Okay.

00:27:39,277 --> 00:27:43,217
Well, C.J., Robert is one of
the top ten cybercrime experts

00:27:43,217 --> 00:27:44,553
in the world.

00:27:44,553 --> 00:27:47,991
If he's not in, there's no way
I'm even gonna think about it.

00:27:47,991 --> 00:27:49,194
I'm out.

00:27:49,194 --> 00:27:50,429
Okay.

00:27:50,429 --> 00:27:51,998
Look, we could make fun.

00:27:51,998 --> 00:27:53,969
You're selling fear,
right?

00:27:53,969 --> 00:27:55,672
But it's not really
a company.

00:27:55,672 --> 00:27:56,740
It's just a product.

00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,909
I'm out.

00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:00,380
Okay.

00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,821
Mr. Wonderful, I think the other
big opportunity here

00:28:04,821 --> 00:28:06,490
is I know you love licensing --

00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:08,227
yeah, yeah,
you know, C.J. --

00:28:08,227 --> 00:28:09,529
so you could license --

00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:10,598
these are going to start to be
built-in --

00:28:10,598 --> 00:28:12,434
I'm also a historian.

00:28:12,434 --> 00:28:13,736
I'm gonna give you a little
story that you're gonna enjoy
and you're gonna learn from.

00:28:13,736 --> 00:28:14,805
Okay.
[ laughs ]
Oh, good.

00:28:14,805 --> 00:28:15,873
I love his stories.

00:28:15,873 --> 00:28:18,078
In the days when there wasn't
any internet,

00:28:18,078 --> 00:28:19,947
and we just had cities
and forts and castles...

00:28:19,947 --> 00:28:20,949
Yeah.

00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,986
...The universal
sign of distress

00:28:22,986 --> 00:28:24,355
was an upside down flag.

00:28:24,355 --> 00:28:26,225
When bad things
were happening,

00:28:26,225 --> 00:28:28,495
they'd turn their flag
upside down and hoist it up.

00:28:28,495 --> 00:28:31,400
Everybody around them knew,
"whoa, this is bad news.

00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,337
Something's really bad
in there."

00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:34,606
okay.

00:28:34,606 --> 00:28:36,309
I think it's time for you
to turn the flag upside down.

00:28:36,309 --> 00:28:37,778
[ laughs ]
Oh, man.

00:28:37,778 --> 00:28:38,613
I'm out.

00:28:38,613 --> 00:28:39,548
All right.

00:28:39,548 --> 00:28:40,583
I hope to prove you wrong.

00:28:41,885 --> 00:28:43,354
Please keep it for your kids.

00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:44,690
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:45,458
See you, bud.

00:28:46,994 --> 00:28:48,230
It's an interesting idea,
you know,

00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,699
'cause you are being watched
all the time,

00:28:49,699 --> 00:28:51,101
everywhere you go.

00:28:51,101 --> 00:28:52,170
It's pretty sick that we're
being watched all the time.

00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,307
That is absolute crap
on a stick.

00:28:54,307 --> 00:28:56,678
ISAKOW: These sharks,
they just live in a bubble.

00:28:56,678 --> 00:28:58,047
I can't believe
they don't understand

00:28:58,047 --> 00:28:59,850
that this is a real
privacy issue for real people.

00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,520
I mean, what's -- what's going
through their head?

00:29:10,301 --> 00:29:12,004
NARRATOR:
Next into the tank

00:29:12,004 --> 00:29:14,208
is a couple
with an affordable solution

00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:17,380
for all those digital photos
stacking up on our smartphones.

00:29:22,222 --> 00:29:23,124
Hi, sharks.

00:29:23,124 --> 00:29:24,893
My name is Brian Whiteman,

00:29:24,893 --> 00:29:27,198
and this is my baby mama,
Julie.

00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:29,534
We're from Chatsworth,
California,

00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:32,106
and today we are seeking
$150,000

00:29:32,106 --> 00:29:34,844
for 20% of our company,
Groovebook.

00:29:34,844 --> 00:29:38,684
Billions of photos are taken
every day from smartphones.

00:29:38,684 --> 00:29:40,153
Who doesn't have a phone

00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:42,791
with hundreds,
if not thousands, of photos?

00:29:42,791 --> 00:29:46,798
What do people do with all
the photos they've taken?

00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:48,935
Absolutely nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

00:29:48,935 --> 00:29:52,942
For just $2.99 a month,
including shipping and handling,

00:29:52,942 --> 00:29:55,079
the Groovebook app
allows you to choose

00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:57,650
up to 100 photos every month
from your smartphone

00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:00,655
and create a beautiful, bound
photo book in just minutes.

00:30:00,655 --> 00:30:03,260
Each month, your Groovebook
gets delivered to you

00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,897
with an exciting new cover.

00:30:04,897 --> 00:30:07,500
Your photos
are automatically stamped

00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,940
with the date and location
so you will never forget.

00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:14,613
They're perforated,
for easy removal,

00:30:14,613 --> 00:30:15,782
and 4x6,

00:30:15,782 --> 00:30:20,056
which is the perfect size
for framing and sharing.

00:30:20,056 --> 00:30:21,058
Who is that?

00:30:21,058 --> 00:30:23,462
Is that you?
Is that you as a little one?

00:30:23,462 --> 00:30:24,230
Why, it is.

00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,466
Aw!
You had hair?

00:30:25,466 --> 00:30:27,535
GREINER: [ laughs ]
I have never seen you with hair.

00:30:27,535 --> 00:30:29,372
Groovebook will save you
time and money

00:30:29,372 --> 00:30:31,609
from printing out your photos
at the store

00:30:31,609 --> 00:30:33,346
and on ink cartridges
at home.

00:30:33,346 --> 00:30:35,749
Forget those expensive
photo books.

00:30:35,749 --> 00:30:37,887
They'll take you hours
online

00:30:37,887 --> 00:30:41,694
and then charge you an arm and
a leg for printing and shipping.

00:30:41,694 --> 00:30:43,563
Groovebook is the answer.

00:30:43,563 --> 00:30:44,732
So, which one of you sharks

00:30:44,732 --> 00:30:46,268
is ready
to get your groove on...

00:30:46,268 --> 00:30:47,804
With Groovebook?
With Groovebook?

00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:48,839
Oy.

00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:50,642
Now my beautiful wife
of 15 years

00:30:50,642 --> 00:30:53,480
is gonna give each one of you
your own custom Groovebook.

00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,716
Oh, wow.

00:30:54,716 --> 00:30:56,386
Thank you.

00:30:56,386 --> 00:30:58,523
Thank you very much.

00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,225
Thank you.

00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:01,594
CUBAN: Thanks, Julie.

00:31:01,594 --> 00:31:03,365
Okay.
So, Brian?

00:31:03,365 --> 00:31:04,366
BRIAN: Yes.

00:31:04,366 --> 00:31:05,769
What do you charge me
for the book?

00:31:05,769 --> 00:31:07,872
You get that entire book
for $2.99 a month,

00:31:07,872 --> 00:31:09,074
including shipping and handling.

00:31:09,074 --> 00:31:10,277
Wow.

00:31:10,277 --> 00:31:11,746
That's a really great price.

00:31:11,746 --> 00:31:12,881
Thank you.

00:31:12,881 --> 00:31:15,319
How are you doing it
for that low of a price?

00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:17,789
What does it cost you
to make the book?

00:31:17,789 --> 00:31:20,060
It costs me $2.30
to make the book.

00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,398
So,
you have a very small profit.

00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:24,334
We have a 70-cents profit margin
per book.

00:31:24,334 --> 00:31:25,469
Wow!

00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:26,672
Do you have any sales?

00:31:26,672 --> 00:31:27,740
Yes, we do.

00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,109
Okay.

00:31:29,109 --> 00:31:31,747
We have 18,000 paid subscribers
in the last 8 months.

00:31:31,747 --> 00:31:32,682
Good for you.
Oh.

00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,084
BRIAN:
18,000 paid subscribers.

00:31:34,084 --> 00:31:35,253
So, what are you making
per month?

00:31:35,253 --> 00:31:36,455
Do the math for me.

00:31:36,455 --> 00:31:38,492
Well, right now,
we're not making any money.

00:31:38,492 --> 00:31:40,729
We need to get to 30,000
customers to break even.

00:31:40,729 --> 00:31:42,366
After we get to
30,000 customers,

00:31:42,366 --> 00:31:44,135
we make 70 cents
every book.

00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:45,805
Why aren't you making money now?

00:31:45,805 --> 00:31:47,909
Because our overhead's
$21,000 a month.

00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:49,244
Who's making these, though?

00:31:49,244 --> 00:31:51,114
We manufacture the books
internally ourselves

00:31:51,114 --> 00:31:52,450
in our print shop.

00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:55,889
Now, why haven't you --
or have you tried another price?

00:31:55,889 --> 00:31:57,826
Because we want everybody
in America

00:31:57,826 --> 00:31:59,395
to be able to afford
this book,

00:31:59,395 --> 00:32:01,164
and we didn't want to have
any excuses --

00:32:01,164 --> 00:32:02,567
come on, guys.
I mean, look --

00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:04,404
nobody in America can get it
if you close the business.

00:32:04,404 --> 00:32:05,506
GREINER: Right.
No.

00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:06,775
Yeah, everybody in America?

00:32:06,775 --> 00:32:08,878
When I hear that,
it's just, like, "be real."

00:32:08,878 --> 00:32:11,549
how much have you guys invested
in this company?

00:32:11,549 --> 00:32:12,852
I've invested $400,000.

00:32:12,852 --> 00:32:13,654
Oh.
HERJAVEC: Wow.

00:32:13,654 --> 00:32:14,856
BRIAN: Yeah.
Wow. Wow.

00:32:14,856 --> 00:32:17,159
If you didn't own
a printing business,

00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:21,500
if I took this book and took it
to another commercial printer,

00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,439
would my costs be
what you're charging today?

00:32:24,439 --> 00:32:25,675
It'd be higher.
It'd be higher.

00:32:25,675 --> 00:32:27,177
No, because I've developed
proprietary software

00:32:27,177 --> 00:32:28,245
and specialized equipment --

00:32:28,245 --> 00:32:29,047
Was Mark right?
would it be higher?

00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:30,182
It would be higher.

00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:30,983
But you understand
the problem with that?

00:32:30,983 --> 00:32:32,218
Yes, yes.

00:32:32,218 --> 00:32:35,091
I need your other business
to stay in business

00:32:35,091 --> 00:32:36,325
with this business.

00:32:36,325 --> 00:32:38,163
You know, I don't think
you ever explained

00:32:38,163 --> 00:32:40,199
why we have the groove
in the side of the book.

00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:41,735
One night
in Brian's frustration --

00:32:41,735 --> 00:32:43,238
he was working on this
for months

00:32:43,238 --> 00:32:45,375
trying to figure out
how to get this book flexible

00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:47,879
so that we can mail it bulk
through the U.S. postal service.

00:32:47,879 --> 00:32:50,784
He was beating with a pen
at the spine of the book.

00:32:50,784 --> 00:32:52,722
He was so mad and frustrated.

00:32:52,722 --> 00:32:55,092
Then he came to me, he's,
like, "Julie, Julie, wake up!"

00:32:55,092 --> 00:32:58,264
and he showed me the photo book,
and it was all damaged,

00:32:58,264 --> 00:33:00,902
and I said to him,
"What are you showing me?"

00:33:00,902 --> 00:33:02,939
and he said,
"Look, it's flexing.

00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,909
It's flexing.
I have the answer."

00:33:04,909 --> 00:33:07,079
we will now
be able to ship the book

00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:08,548
at about 80 cents apiece.

00:33:08,548 --> 00:33:10,586
So because this book
is flexible, and this is --

00:33:10,586 --> 00:33:12,856
we have a patent pending
on the groove inside the book.

00:33:12,856 --> 00:33:14,158
Because it's flexible,

00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,229
I'm able to mail it
for 82 cents.

00:33:16,229 --> 00:33:19,134
So, that is the value
proposition in your business.

00:33:19,134 --> 00:33:22,205
So, if you changed the postage
because of the new binding,

00:33:22,205 --> 00:33:23,241
what does it cost?

00:33:23,241 --> 00:33:24,543
It'll go up $3 to $4.

00:33:24,543 --> 00:33:26,246
So, anyone
that tries to compete with us

00:33:26,246 --> 00:33:28,016
is gonna have $4
just in postage.

00:33:28,016 --> 00:33:30,520
And you're saying you can
protect this groove in it

00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,688
because it's patent pending?

00:33:31,688 --> 00:33:33,292
Yes.
CUBAN:
That's what I'm saying,

00:33:33,292 --> 00:33:34,728
that's the most valuable asset
that you have.
this is really amazing.

00:33:34,728 --> 00:33:36,731
Brian, can I --
can I ask you a question

00:33:36,731 --> 00:33:37,800
as a potential investor?

00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,102
Mm-hmm.

00:33:39,102 --> 00:33:42,140
Would you consider raising
your price by a dollar?

00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,543
Yes,
we would be open to that.

00:33:43,543 --> 00:33:45,279
CUBAN: See, I think that's
the wrong business altogether.

00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,117
I say Groovebook
as a service...

00:33:48,117 --> 00:33:49,152
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,723
...Okay, that starts
to get interesting.

00:33:51,723 --> 00:33:54,195
So, I can go to Shutterfly
and say,

00:33:54,195 --> 00:33:57,400
"Shutterfly, you can't offer
something like this.

00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,802
You have high shipping."

00:33:58,802 --> 00:34:01,373
Right, their average book
is $30 a book.

00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:02,375
Ours is $2.99.

00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:03,644
Forget the pricing.

00:34:03,644 --> 00:34:05,514
I want to make it a service
so that --

00:34:05,514 --> 00:34:07,585
the problem is you don't own
that customer.

00:34:07,585 --> 00:34:08,687
What's that?
You don't own that customer.

00:34:08,687 --> 00:34:09,688
HERJAVEC: No, no,
but Mark is dead-on.

00:34:09,688 --> 00:34:10,790
Mark is --
what you have here --

00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:11,959
you don't own the customer
anymore.

00:34:11,959 --> 00:34:13,294
This is a unique act,

00:34:13,294 --> 00:34:16,166
the groove and the ability to
ship and create these pictures

00:34:16,166 --> 00:34:17,668
so inexpensively through you.

00:34:17,668 --> 00:34:19,606
Entrepreneurs lie to themselves
all the time.

00:34:19,606 --> 00:34:20,841
They get visions of grandeur,

00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:23,044
and here you are giving us
those visions of grandeur

00:34:23,044 --> 00:34:25,182
by saying you want this for
every home in America, right?

00:34:25,182 --> 00:34:26,417
Get over that.

00:34:26,417 --> 00:34:29,222
Wouldn't you rather
be able to say to all those --

00:34:29,222 --> 00:34:32,461
all those applications that
you're competing with right now,

00:34:32,461 --> 00:34:34,498
"Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah,
I've got a groove

00:34:34,498 --> 00:34:37,303
and I can ship this for 82 cents
and you can't"?

00:34:37,303 --> 00:34:40,208
But if you want to offer this
to all your customers,

00:34:40,208 --> 00:34:42,445
I'm gonna give you
an interface,

00:34:42,445 --> 00:34:45,250
and I'm gonna charge you 7 cents
a picture.

00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,553
You become a commercial printer
in his scenario.

00:34:47,553 --> 00:34:48,656
No, no, better yet,

00:34:48,656 --> 00:34:50,860
all you do is you become
a money collector.

00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,296
I think Mark's dead-on.

00:34:52,296 --> 00:34:54,332
There are
so many applications,

00:34:54,332 --> 00:34:57,538
as more photo sites come up
and people upload to them.

00:34:57,538 --> 00:34:59,574
You've done something
none of them can do

00:34:59,574 --> 00:35:00,710
at that price point.

00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,546
Yes! Okay, guys,
I'm gonna make you an offer.

00:35:02,546 --> 00:35:04,583
I'll give you $150,000

00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:08,457
for 100% of the rights
to sell Groovebook

00:35:08,457 --> 00:35:11,195
as a service through
your commercial printer

00:35:11,195 --> 00:35:12,431
to everybody else.

00:35:12,431 --> 00:35:16,871
You keep 100% of the Groovebook
subscription service.

00:35:16,871 --> 00:35:18,909
I want to license this
as a service,

00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:21,179
and then I can go to everybody
and say,

00:35:21,179 --> 00:35:25,252
"Look, 82 cents to ship this,
$2.30 to print it.

00:35:25,252 --> 00:35:27,623
I'm gonna mark it up
by 3 bucks."

00:35:27,623 --> 00:35:30,762
if Shutterfly, Flickr,
whoever it is -- Picasa --

00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:33,467
this way you can offer it
to all your customers.

00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:35,671
Brian,
I think it's a phenomenal idea.

00:35:35,671 --> 00:35:36,673
Thank you.

00:35:36,673 --> 00:35:39,344
But this business
does not exist

00:35:39,344 --> 00:35:40,980
without your commercial
printing business.

00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,451
Your costs are artificially low

00:35:43,451 --> 00:35:45,922
because of your other business.

00:35:45,922 --> 00:35:47,692
I have a problem with that.

00:35:47,692 --> 00:35:49,996
If I get into business
with Groovebook

00:35:49,996 --> 00:35:52,533
and the commercial
printing business goes away,

00:35:52,533 --> 00:35:53,368
what do I do?

00:35:53,368 --> 00:35:56,673
Like, I -- it's so symbiotic.

00:35:56,673 --> 00:35:58,177
They're so related.

00:35:58,177 --> 00:35:59,746
One doesn't exist
without the other.

00:35:59,746 --> 00:36:01,482
That's why your price point
is so low

00:36:01,482 --> 00:36:02,818
because you're able to do that.

00:36:02,818 --> 00:36:04,287
I'm out.

00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,823
Thank you.
Okay, thank you.

00:36:05,823 --> 00:36:06,925
Robert made a point.

00:36:06,925 --> 00:36:08,327
I'm a partner in Groovebook.

00:36:08,327 --> 00:36:10,665
You go out of business or
you decide to raise the prices

00:36:10,665 --> 00:36:12,968
or anything else happens
with your commercial printer,

00:36:12,968 --> 00:36:13,770
I have a problem.

00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:14,939
I'm out.

00:36:18,044 --> 00:36:20,315
Would you consider selling me
the whole thing?

00:36:20,315 --> 00:36:22,753
At the right price.

00:36:22,753 --> 00:36:27,260
Well, you've put a value on it
of $750,000, right?

00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,362
Correct.

00:36:28,362 --> 00:36:30,032
Would you consider selling
the whole thing?

00:36:30,032 --> 00:36:31,201
And by the way, Brian,

00:36:31,201 --> 00:36:33,405
that's what you walked in here
asking for.

00:36:33,405 --> 00:36:34,774
I gave you what you wanted.

00:36:34,774 --> 00:36:37,445
Yes, but we'd like to have
some upside on that, also.

00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,949
So, Mark, I'd like to just
clarify a little bit more,

00:36:39,949 --> 00:36:40,684
one more time, please.

00:36:40,684 --> 00:36:41,752
CUBAN: Sure.

00:36:41,752 --> 00:36:43,856
So, in essence,
I'm paying you 150k

00:36:43,856 --> 00:36:45,091
to be the right to be,

00:36:45,091 --> 00:36:47,662
hopefully, your commercial
printing company's

00:36:47,662 --> 00:36:49,900
largest Groovebook supplier.

00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,336
HERJAVEC:
So, Brian, Julie,

00:36:51,336 --> 00:36:53,607
you've got $150,000
for a pure licensing deal.

00:36:53,607 --> 00:36:55,610
You keep 100% of your business.

00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:56,378
Okay.

00:36:56,378 --> 00:36:58,014
The other offer from Kevin

00:36:58,014 --> 00:37:01,119
is the full value
of what you put on your company,

00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,592
$750,000,
for 100% of the business.

00:37:04,592 --> 00:37:06,762
Two completely different
avenues.

00:37:06,762 --> 00:37:07,597
Totally different.

00:37:07,597 --> 00:37:08,733
So, so --

00:37:08,733 --> 00:37:10,035
I think we'd like
to counter Kevin's offer.

00:37:10,035 --> 00:37:12,940
Yeah, we'd like to counter
Kevin's offer,

00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:16,345
and we think the company
at this stage of the game

00:37:16,345 --> 00:37:17,748
is worth $6 million.

00:37:17,748 --> 00:37:18,616
Oh!
Oh!

00:37:18,616 --> 00:37:19,351
Wow.

00:37:28,466 --> 00:37:29,936
NARRATOR:
Two sharks are out.

00:37:29,936 --> 00:37:32,040
Brian and Julie
have two offers on the table --

00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,143
one from Mark for $150,000

00:37:34,143 --> 00:37:37,382
for the licensing rights
to Groovebook

00:37:37,382 --> 00:37:41,156
and one from Kevin,
who has offered $750,000

00:37:41,156 --> 00:37:43,459
to buy 100% of the company.

00:37:43,459 --> 00:37:45,663
Two completely different
avenues.

00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:47,566
Totally different.
So, so --

00:37:47,566 --> 00:37:48,735
I think we'd like to counter
Kevin's offer.

00:37:48,735 --> 00:37:51,506
Yeah. We'd like to counter
Kevin's offer,

00:37:51,506 --> 00:37:55,247
and we think the -- the company
at this stage of the game

00:37:55,247 --> 00:37:56,649
is worth $6 million.

00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:57,851
Oh!
Oh!
Wow.

00:37:57,851 --> 00:38:00,823
But you valued it
at $750,000.

00:38:00,823 --> 00:38:02,325
Because we want to be
a part of the upside.

00:38:02,325 --> 00:38:06,132
If you don't want to sell
100% of it, I understand,

00:38:06,132 --> 00:38:08,403
but you can't take the price
and multiply it by 6

00:38:08,403 --> 00:38:09,237
to sell control.

00:38:09,237 --> 00:38:10,506
Nobody would do that to you.

00:38:10,506 --> 00:38:12,710
Sure, they can.
They can do whatever they want.

00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,846
No, but it won't happen.

00:38:13,846 --> 00:38:15,081
The transaction won't occur.

00:38:15,081 --> 00:38:17,218
Are you saying yes or no
to their $6 million?

00:38:17,218 --> 00:38:19,889
No, I won't pay $6 million for
it, and you knew I wouldn't.

00:38:19,889 --> 00:38:21,191
Is there some middle ground?

00:38:21,191 --> 00:38:22,494
And you don't want us to have
any skin in the game

00:38:22,494 --> 00:38:24,298
and grow it with you?
well, I do, but I'm just --

00:38:24,298 --> 00:38:27,102
I asked you simply to understand
you as an entrepreneur,

00:38:27,102 --> 00:38:28,237
where your head's at.

00:38:28,237 --> 00:38:29,372
Do you want to sell out?

00:38:29,372 --> 00:38:31,076
Is there a price
that makes sense?

00:38:31,076 --> 00:38:32,344
The answer is no. I get it.

00:38:32,344 --> 00:38:34,248
We want to have more skin
in the game. We --

00:38:34,248 --> 00:38:36,351
how much skin in the game
do you want, my friend?

00:38:36,351 --> 00:38:37,988
I'd like to have
at least 50%.

00:38:37,988 --> 00:38:39,924
You want me to grow
the business.

00:38:39,924 --> 00:38:41,126
We are so passionate --

00:38:41,126 --> 00:38:42,162
that's why my deal was perfect
for you, then.

00:38:42,162 --> 00:38:43,331
JULIE: You have to understand,
Brian --

00:38:43,331 --> 00:38:45,267
your deal is -- is --
it makes a lot of sense,

00:38:45,267 --> 00:38:46,569
but with yours,

00:38:46,569 --> 00:38:48,005
I'd like to have a little bit
of skin in the game

00:38:48,005 --> 00:38:50,376
rather than 100% royalty because
I'm manufacturing for you.

00:38:50,376 --> 00:38:53,681
What do you think 50%
of Groovebook is worth today?

00:38:53,681 --> 00:38:56,119
Kevin.
[ indistinct conversation ]

00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:58,990
it's worth $375,000.
and it's a no-brainer.

00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,460
All we want to do is we want to
make a win-win situation.

00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,795
So you would sell --

00:39:01,795 --> 00:39:04,433
okay, you would sell
50% of Groovebook for $375,000?

00:39:07,706 --> 00:39:09,843
Listen, we're gonna --
Mark and I are just gonna step
aside for one second, okay?

00:39:09,843 --> 00:39:11,345
GREINER: If you'll do that --
HERJAVEC: What are you --

00:39:11,345 --> 00:39:13,916
if you'll do that,
then I will give you the deal.

00:39:13,916 --> 00:39:16,621
You do not want to do a $375,000
for 50%. You don't.

00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:19,726
$375,000 for 50%, but I don't
want to be competing with Mark.

00:39:19,726 --> 00:39:21,263
Yeah, I'll jump in on her
with that deal.

00:39:21,263 --> 00:39:22,665
I don't want to compete
with Mark,

00:39:22,665 --> 00:39:24,902
because I don't want there to be
all these other people out there

00:39:24,902 --> 00:39:25,871
using the same technology.

00:39:25,871 --> 00:39:27,340
If you get the patent,

00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:30,178
I would be willing to give you
the $375,000,

00:39:30,178 --> 00:39:32,616
and if Robert
wants to go in on it --

00:39:32,616 --> 00:39:34,185
happy to go in with it.

00:39:34,185 --> 00:39:35,854
Great, at 50% -- 25%/25%.

00:39:35,854 --> 00:39:36,923
But the whole business.

00:39:36,923 --> 00:39:38,692
No licensing to somebody else.
Right.

00:39:38,692 --> 00:39:40,263
You got to control
the whole thing.

00:39:40,263 --> 00:39:41,565
Not doing what Mark is saying.

00:39:41,565 --> 00:39:43,601
And if you'll do it right now,
we can have a deal.

00:39:43,601 --> 00:39:45,471
Brian, you said you'd sell 50%
for $375,000.

00:39:45,471 --> 00:39:46,673
Will you do the deal?

00:39:46,673 --> 00:39:48,410
Hell, no.
Are you kidding?

00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:49,813
He's smarter than that.

00:39:49,813 --> 00:39:50,747
O'LEARY: Okay, guys.

00:39:50,747 --> 00:39:52,417
No, no, no, no, hang on.
Hang on.

00:39:52,417 --> 00:39:53,953
Maybe that's
a better deal.

00:39:53,953 --> 00:39:56,391
Lori made an offer.
I'd like to hear their offer.

00:39:56,391 --> 00:39:58,194
Okay,
let me say what we decided.

00:39:58,194 --> 00:40:04,538
$150,000 for a license
to the name and the software

00:40:04,538 --> 00:40:07,977
and the ability to offer it
as a service.

00:40:07,977 --> 00:40:09,546
80% for Kevin and I,

00:40:09,546 --> 00:40:12,619
20% for you,
so you share in the upside.

00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:14,355
What we're gonna be
is the one-off guys.

00:40:14,355 --> 00:40:15,624
Mm-hmm.

00:40:15,624 --> 00:40:19,263
So when someone says, "I have
375 pictures on my camera.

00:40:19,263 --> 00:40:21,434
"I don't want a subscription.

00:40:21,434 --> 00:40:23,972
I want a place where I can go
and buy it."

00:40:23,972 --> 00:40:25,841
You'll be
the owner of Groovebook

00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:28,045
and the Groovebook
subscription service.

00:40:28,045 --> 00:40:29,448
We'll be Groovebook

00:40:29,448 --> 00:40:32,453
for all one-off applications
or purchases.

00:40:32,453 --> 00:40:33,622
Okay.

00:40:33,622 --> 00:40:35,959
HERJAVEC: But, Brian,
you realize that --

00:40:35,959 --> 00:40:37,395
that is a really bad thing
to do.

00:40:37,395 --> 00:40:39,331
He's giving an alternative
to all your customers

00:40:39,331 --> 00:40:41,102
that you're trying to build
a business to.

00:40:41,102 --> 00:40:43,038
They don't have to be
subscribers.

00:40:43,038 --> 00:40:45,476
He's building a competitive
one-off business.

00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:48,047
It's kind of like the movie
"there will be blood."

00:40:48,047 --> 00:40:48,881
[ laughter ]

00:40:48,881 --> 00:40:50,652
You know, the guy had the oil,

00:40:50,652 --> 00:40:53,557
and, you know, he didn't
want to give up the oil

00:40:53,557 --> 00:40:54,859
to Daniel Day-Lewis,

00:40:54,859 --> 00:40:57,797
so Daniel Day-Lewis
bought the house next to him.

00:40:57,797 --> 00:41:00,769
He dug underneath,
and he sucked his oil well dry.

00:41:00,769 --> 00:41:01,871
GREINER: Exactly.

00:41:01,871 --> 00:41:03,807
You realize,
I'm a subscriber.

00:41:03,807 --> 00:41:06,078
I'm about to sign up
for Groovebook.

00:41:06,078 --> 00:41:10,118
I look on Flickr, and I say,
"Oh, I don't need to subscribe.

00:41:10,118 --> 00:41:11,821
I can do it one time."

00:41:11,821 --> 00:41:15,127
so now you have two sharks,
Kevin and Mark,

00:41:15,127 --> 00:41:17,297
who want to give you $150,000

00:41:17,297 --> 00:41:21,571
for 80% of
the non-subscription business.

00:41:21,571 --> 00:41:23,642
And then you have another offer

00:41:23,642 --> 00:41:27,703
with two sharks
who want to give you $375,000

00:41:27,703 --> 00:41:29,405
for 50% of your business,

00:41:29,405 --> 00:41:31,907
and they help grow
everything with you.

00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:33,409
What are you going to do?

00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:36,378
Well, I think we've done

00:41:36,378 --> 00:41:38,647
an excellent job
growing it ourselves

00:41:38,647 --> 00:41:41,517
to 18,000 subscribers
in a short period of time.

00:41:41,517 --> 00:41:45,621
I think the better deal...

00:41:47,289 --> 00:41:50,726
...Would be to go
with Mark and Mr. Wonderful

00:41:50,726 --> 00:41:53,862
because 100%
of growing it ourselves

00:41:53,862 --> 00:41:55,998
plus an additional
20% of revenue

00:41:55,998 --> 00:41:57,566
that you guys will work at

00:41:57,566 --> 00:41:59,602
I think
is a win/win situation.

00:41:59,602 --> 00:42:02,004
And I'm all about making
win/win situations.

00:42:02,004 --> 00:42:03,405
Do you accept their offer?

00:42:03,405 --> 00:42:04,940
Yes, we do.
Yes, we do.

00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,342
CUBAN: Let's go to work!

00:42:06,342 --> 00:42:08,043
Congratulations.

00:42:09,912 --> 00:42:12,014
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it.

00:42:12,014 --> 00:42:13,182
Thank you. Thank you.

00:42:13,182 --> 00:42:14,950
So exciting.
It's very cool.

00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:16,552
GREINER: Congratulations.

00:42:16,552 --> 00:42:18,954
Thank you so much.
Thank you very much.

00:42:18,954 --> 00:42:21,824
Oh, my God!

00:42:21,824 --> 00:42:23,158
Wow!

00:42:23,158 --> 00:42:24,660
Whoo!

00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,594
Dang!

00:42:25,594 --> 00:42:26,595
They're still in love.
Whoo!
