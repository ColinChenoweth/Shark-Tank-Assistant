00:00:00,669 --> 00:00:03,428
NARRATOR:
This is the Shark Tank,
where hopeful entrepreneurs

00:00:03,428 --> 00:00:06,200
get a once-in-a-lifetime chance
to pitch the sharks

00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,371
in hopes of
getting an investment

00:00:08,371 --> 00:00:10,877
to start, grow,
or save their businesses.

00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:12,280
[ all cheering ]

00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,251
NARRATOR: The entrepreneurs
must convince a shark

00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:16,355
to invest the full amount
they're asking for,

00:00:16,355 --> 00:00:18,392
or they'll
walk away with nothing.

00:00:18,392 --> 00:00:20,564
I had the clown community
criticize me.

00:00:20,564 --> 00:00:21,900
I'm not joking.

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,102
You don't want to piss off
the clown community.

00:00:23,102 --> 00:00:25,207
They're gonna squash me
like a bug.

00:00:25,207 --> 00:00:27,578
This is one of the classic
situations in "Shark Tank"

00:00:27,578 --> 00:00:30,484
where you come in thinking
that it's worth $1 million.

00:00:30,484 --> 00:00:32,221
Don't ask a million bucks
for something

00:00:32,221 --> 00:00:34,393
that hasn't made any money yet.
what, are you guys nuts?!

00:00:34,393 --> 00:00:35,729
Sure,
w-we have a budding --

00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:37,799
shut up!
whoa.

00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:39,336
NARRATOR: If the sharks
hear a great idea...

00:00:39,336 --> 00:00:41,273
All you got to do is draw
some horns on him, and he's set.

00:00:41,273 --> 00:00:43,177
...They're ready to invest,

00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:44,914
using their own money.
whoo!

00:00:44,914 --> 00:00:46,485
NARRATOR: And they're willing
to fight each other

00:00:46,485 --> 00:00:48,188
for a piece of the action.

00:00:48,188 --> 00:00:49,691
I'll give you
the $125,000.

00:00:49,691 --> 00:00:50,894
HERJAVEC:
You know what?

00:00:50,894 --> 00:00:52,598
I'll give you the $125,000,
no royalty,

00:00:52,598 --> 00:00:53,767
if you do the deal right now.

00:00:53,767 --> 00:00:55,102
"Boom" goes
the dynamite!

00:00:55,102 --> 00:00:56,104

Wow.

00:00:56,104 --> 00:00:57,775
...2...1...

00:01:00,347 --> 00:01:01,817
NARRATOR:
Who are the sharks?

00:01:01,817 --> 00:01:04,990
They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors

00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:08,497
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.

00:01:08,497 --> 00:01:11,170
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist

00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,073
who turned a $10,000 loan

00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:17,683
into a software business
worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:22,293
Barbara Corcoran went
from waiting tables in Manhattan

00:01:22,293 --> 00:01:25,399
to building the city's
preeminent real-estate empire.

00:01:27,236 --> 00:01:29,975
Robert Herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,

00:01:29,975 --> 00:01:31,980
is now a technology mogul

00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,749
who sold his
first internet companies

00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:36,623
for over $350 million.

00:01:37,492 --> 00:01:39,863
Lori Greiner, the queen of QVC,

And Mark Cuban, notorious
billionaire entrepreneur,

PADAWER:
My name is Lauren Padawer,

00:02:10,026 --> 00:02:11,896
I live in Cordova, Alaska,

00:02:11,896 --> 00:02:14,201
and I'm the founder
of Alaska Glacial Mud Company.

00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:16,806
Besides running my company,

00:02:16,806 --> 00:02:18,844
I work as
a commercial salmon fisherman.

00:02:18,844 --> 00:02:20,113
Being a salmon fisherman,

00:02:20,113 --> 00:02:22,184
you have to love
being out on the water,

00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:24,021
and you have to love
taking risks.

00:02:24,021 --> 00:02:26,327
It's not so different
than being an entrepreneur

00:02:26,327 --> 00:02:28,397
and being able
to stick your neck out there

00:02:28,397 --> 00:02:30,401
to do something you love.

00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:32,072
[ kettle whistling ]

00:02:32,072 --> 00:02:33,274
Hi.
This is Lauren.

00:02:33,274 --> 00:02:35,546
Starting a business in Alaska
is challenging

00:02:35,546 --> 00:02:37,717
because we're so far
from everywhere else.

00:02:37,717 --> 00:02:40,389
Getting to meetings or just
paying for a plane ticket

00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:41,759
poses some real challenges.

00:02:43,095 --> 00:02:45,967
Alaska Glacial Mud Company
is treading water.

00:02:45,967 --> 00:02:47,504
I need an investment
from the sharks

00:02:47,504 --> 00:02:49,141
to take my company
to the next level.

00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:50,610
I want everyone everywhere

00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,018
to experience a little bit of
the purity and beauty of Alaska.

00:03:06,944 --> 00:03:08,715
Hello, sharks.

00:03:08,715 --> 00:03:11,120
My name is Lauren Padawer.

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,761
I live in Cordova, Alaska,
where I am both the founder

00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:17,600
and owner
of Alaska Glacial Mud Company.

00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,840
I'm here today seeking $100,000

00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,614
in exchange for 20%
of Alaska Glacial Mud Company.

00:03:24,614 --> 00:03:26,218
As a commercial fisherman,

00:03:26,218 --> 00:03:29,191
I know Alaska is already famous
for wild salmon,

00:03:29,191 --> 00:03:32,264
but someday,
I'd like to see us famous

00:03:32,264 --> 00:03:33,533
for a luxurious

00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:36,539
and nutrient-rich
Alaska glacial mud.

00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:38,911
The idea
for Alaska Glacial Mud Company

00:03:38,911 --> 00:03:41,149
started
on a wilderness rafting trip

00:03:41,149 --> 00:03:42,953
down the majestic copper river.

00:03:42,953 --> 00:03:47,095
As soon as I stepped in,
my feet sank into buttery mud.

00:03:47,095 --> 00:03:49,433
It was such a divine sensation,

00:03:49,433 --> 00:03:53,442
I proceeded to cover my face
and body in the silky mud

00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:56,281
at the most wild spa
in the world.

00:03:56,281 --> 00:04:00,256
After washing it off,
my skin was soft and glowing.

00:04:00,256 --> 00:04:02,594
I want to see this amazing mud

00:04:02,594 --> 00:04:05,433
become an industry standard
in the spa market.

00:04:05,433 --> 00:04:08,006
So, sharks, who wants
to get their fins dirty

00:04:08,006 --> 00:04:09,408
and play in the mud with me?

00:04:09,408 --> 00:04:10,544
GREINER: [ chuckling ]

00:04:10,544 --> 00:04:11,546
Mm.

00:04:11,546 --> 00:04:13,049
Are you the only one
that ever discovered

00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:15,153
that this was the best mud
in the world?

00:04:15,153 --> 00:04:19,529
There is no other Alaska glacial
mud products on the market.

00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:21,667
Lauren, can we see it?
Absolutely.

00:04:24,105 --> 00:04:25,542
For you.

00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:28,114
Thank you.
There's a mixture here

00:04:28,114 --> 00:04:30,652
of some of
the different products we carry.

00:04:30,652 --> 00:04:31,754
Thank you.

00:04:31,754 --> 00:04:33,124
Thank you,
Lauren.

00:04:33,124 --> 00:04:34,293

CORCORAN: Thank you.
Barbara.

00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,300
Very nice of you.
Mark.

00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:41,075
O'LEARY: Have you processed
this mud in any way?

00:04:41,075 --> 00:04:42,344
It goes
through a refining process

00:04:42,344 --> 00:04:44,481
to ensure quality control.

00:04:44,481 --> 00:04:45,918
The mud is --
'cause I-I'm worried

00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:47,622
that a big bear
would've taken a large dump

00:04:47,622 --> 00:04:48,624
near where you were.

00:04:48,624 --> 00:04:50,227
[ laughter ]
Oh, God.

00:04:50,227 --> 00:04:51,863
It's the cleanest mud
in the world,

00:04:51,863 --> 00:04:53,033
and it comes from

00:04:53,033 --> 00:04:55,972
one of the most pristine
wild rivers in the world.

00:04:55,972 --> 00:04:59,580
I would actually really like to
have Mr. Wonderful come up here

00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,082
and give you a glacial facial.

00:05:01,082 --> 00:05:02,219
Whoa!
Okay, then.

00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:05,091
I just hope I'm not
being covered in bear poo.

00:05:05,091 --> 00:05:07,195
[ laughs ]
Oh, God.

00:05:07,195 --> 00:05:08,197
No,
this is very pure.

00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:11,638
GREINER: How long
would you need to leave it?

00:05:11,638 --> 00:05:12,674
In order to dry,

00:05:12,674 --> 00:05:15,713
it would take
about 10 to 15 minutes.

00:05:15,713 --> 00:05:18,419
Does it draw the impurities
up out of your skin?

00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:19,421
Absolutely.

00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:21,993
It contains
microfine clay particles

00:05:21,993 --> 00:05:25,067
that absorb toxins
and exfoliate dead skin.

00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:26,402
Somehow this looks like
the true you.

00:05:26,402 --> 00:05:28,506
CUBAN: All you got to do
is draw some horns on him,

00:05:28,506 --> 00:05:29,743
and he's set.
[ laughter ]

00:05:29,743 --> 00:05:32,315

can be used with this stuff?

00:05:38,094 --> 00:05:39,162
O'LEARY:
It's very cooling.

00:05:39,162 --> 00:05:40,666
I feel the toxins
leaving my body.

00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:43,605
PADAWER: The copper river
where this comes from

00:05:43,605 --> 00:05:46,344
is an incredibly pure
and wild place

00:05:46,344 --> 00:05:49,017
as you all may know if you're
fans of copper river salmon.

00:05:49,017 --> 00:05:51,722
How much are you selling today,
and how are you selling it?

00:05:51,722 --> 00:05:55,530
Our sales to date
are $36,000 a year.

00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,701
Ooh.

00:05:57,701 --> 00:06:00,306
$36,000 a year.

00:06:00,306 --> 00:06:02,979
Do you have a small shop,
Lauren, that you sell it in?

00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:04,716
No,
I do not have a retail shop.

00:06:04,716 --> 00:06:06,520
We wholesale it to spas.

00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,588
In Alaska?

00:06:07,588 --> 00:06:10,027
We wholesale it
all over the world.

00:06:10,027 --> 00:06:13,768
Your real target
that you most want are the spas?

00:06:13,768 --> 00:06:16,106
Yes,
I'm interested in the spas,

00:06:16,106 --> 00:06:18,511
but there is a lot of products
on the market

00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:21,017
that people buy
for themselves at home,

00:06:21,017 --> 00:06:23,188
I mean, especially
in more depressed economies,

00:06:23,188 --> 00:06:24,724
people who can't afford
to go to a spa.

00:06:24,724 --> 00:06:26,995
What does that jar sell
for retail?

00:06:26,995 --> 00:06:28,198
It sells for $34.

00:06:28,198 --> 00:06:30,736
And what does it cost
to make one jar?

00:06:30,736 --> 00:06:32,340
About $3.
CUBAN: That's good margins.

00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,611
It's hard
to crack into the spa market

00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:37,150
is the problem
because...
it's so hard.

00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,187
...There's so few products
that spas carry.
It's so hard.

00:06:39,187 --> 00:06:41,091
They'll usually
carry one product

00:06:41,091 --> 00:06:42,628
and then
endorse the line.

00:06:42,628 --> 00:06:45,634
So I understand why you're
having a problem getting in.

00:06:45,634 --> 00:06:50,345
It's a really great concept,
but there's hundreds of people

00:06:50,345 --> 00:06:54,052
that want to get in
but so few that ever can.

00:06:54,052 --> 00:06:56,690
And for that reason,
I'm out.

00:06:58,261 --> 00:07:00,365
It does take a lot to break
in this industry,

00:07:00,365 --> 00:07:01,902
and I will --
yes.

00:07:01,902 --> 00:07:03,539
How much money have you
put into it, Lauren?

00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:05,543
I've put $50,000
into the business.

00:07:05,543 --> 00:07:07,748
Where did you get
that money?

00:07:07,748 --> 00:07:11,188
That's from money that
I have saved over the years.

00:07:11,188 --> 00:07:13,158
Fishing is where
I do make my income.

00:07:13,158 --> 00:07:15,697
The fishing is only three months
out of the year.

00:07:15,697 --> 00:07:19,038
Scary, isn't it, when you put up
everything you have?

00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,077
How much money do you make
on the fishing side?

00:07:22,077 --> 00:07:25,284
I gross a little over
$100,000 a year.

00:07:25,284 --> 00:07:27,188
Wow.
Well, good for you.

00:07:27,188 --> 00:07:28,691
You bring in
$100,000 a year?

00:07:28,691 --> 00:07:29,794
Yes.
That's incredible.

00:07:29,794 --> 00:07:30,796
That's amazing.

00:07:30,796 --> 00:07:31,998
I want to buy
into your fish business.

00:07:31,998 --> 00:07:33,367
Do you fish alone?

00:07:33,367 --> 00:07:35,305
I fish alone.
Wow!

00:07:35,305 --> 00:07:37,176
Really?
You're a beast.
Congratulations.

00:07:37,176 --> 00:07:40,415
I-I am a risk taker.

professionally commercial-fish

in the town that I'm in,

00:07:44,424 --> 00:07:46,996
but this is something
that I really felt I could do,

00:07:46,996 --> 00:07:49,501
and it was naive to think
that I could go into this

00:07:49,501 --> 00:07:51,840
and build the business slowly
and organically.

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,077
I honestly --
Lauren,
one of the biggest challenges

00:07:54,077 --> 00:07:57,885
is making the decision when
to grow something organically,

00:07:57,885 --> 00:08:00,691
just grind it out,
or to spend a lot of money

00:08:00,691 --> 00:08:03,630
and go big and then
create pull-through demand.

00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,633
Mm-hmm.

00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:06,369
You've got to connect
to something

00:08:06,369 --> 00:08:08,975
that's already in place
so people can connect it to you.

00:08:08,975 --> 00:08:10,578
You might
want to look at

00:08:10,578 --> 00:08:12,850
changing it
to copper river glacial mud

00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,653
or something to leverage it
because --

00:08:14,653 --> 00:08:15,956
I think
it's a good idea.

00:08:15,956 --> 00:08:18,862
But because there's a big leap
from where you are

00:08:18,862 --> 00:08:21,301
to where I think
you need to be to be investable,

00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:23,639
for those reasons,
I have to say that I'm out.

00:08:25,176 --> 00:08:27,080
Alaska's hot right now.

00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,819
Alaska tourists
spend over $300 million a year

00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:32,090
in products
just in our price range.

00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:35,230
HERJAVEC: So, Lauren, your mud
may actually be better,

00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:38,036
but the consumer walking
into the spa doesn't know that.

00:08:38,036 --> 00:08:40,273
That's why I'm here.
But --

00:08:40,273 --> 00:08:41,844
I need your help.

00:08:41,844 --> 00:08:43,147
I mean, I have been working
really hard to make this happen.

00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,282
I mean --
oh, I hear you,

00:08:44,282 --> 00:08:46,988
but you could spend millions
to educate a market.

00:08:46,988 --> 00:08:50,462
You can't go global when
you're doing $36,000 a year.

00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,100
I'm out.

00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,143
Okay, thank you, Robert.

00:08:57,143 --> 00:08:59,113
You've got a lot of good things
going for you.

00:08:59,113 --> 00:09:00,249
Thank you, Barbara.

00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:01,952
And you have
a great story.

00:09:01,952 --> 00:09:03,523
I could see you hanging out
with the bears...

00:09:03,523 --> 00:09:04,792
I am a very sweet person.

00:09:04,792 --> 00:09:07,097
...On the sleds with the dogs
and by a beautiful river.

00:09:07,097 --> 00:09:08,232
I want to make this happen.

00:09:08,232 --> 00:09:10,905
I invest in a company
called nardo's,

00:09:10,905 --> 00:09:12,073
exactly the same space
you're in,

00:09:12,073 --> 00:09:13,410
about a year
and a half ago,

00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,381
and I've learned a lot of things
about the cosmetic industry.

00:09:15,381 --> 00:09:16,917
Here's the thing.

00:09:16,917 --> 00:09:20,391
It's very hard
to be retail and spa.

00:09:20,391 --> 00:09:22,963
You have to figure out
what your market is,

00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:25,234
or you're gonna waste
a lot of money.

00:09:25,234 --> 00:09:27,339
I wish you the best of luck,
but I'm out.

00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:29,243
Okay, thank you, Barbara.

00:09:29,243 --> 00:09:30,312
CUBAN: Well, Lauren,
you've got --

00:09:30,312 --> 00:09:33,084
I have Mr. mud face left.
[ laughter ]

00:09:33,084 --> 00:09:35,523
Kevin has never
looked better.

00:09:35,523 --> 00:09:36,625
O'LEARY:
My other problem with it

00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:37,961
that none of the other sharks
picked up on

00:09:37,961 --> 00:09:41,768
but anybody can go pick up mud
out of the copper river.

00:09:41,768 --> 00:09:43,606
Right! They're gonna go
up there and say,

00:09:43,606 --> 00:09:45,209
"Get out of the way,
Lauren.

00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,345
That's my mud pile."

00:09:46,345 --> 00:09:47,848
they're gonna squash me
like a bug.

00:09:47,848 --> 00:09:49,117
No, no.
[ laughter ]

00:09:49,117 --> 00:09:50,320
they've already done that.

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,957
O'LEARY: Tell me
if this is not the truth.

00:09:51,957 --> 00:09:53,693
You're taking
a successful business --

00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,632
your fishing business --

00:09:55,632 --> 00:09:57,769
and subsidizing so far
an unsuccessful one.

00:09:57,769 --> 00:09:59,005
I have a saying.

00:09:59,005 --> 00:10:01,510
Any business that after
three years is not profitable

00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,381
is not a business.
it's a hobby.

00:10:03,381 --> 00:10:06,922
Look, I can't go down the river
with you on this one

00:10:06,922 --> 00:10:08,692
because I've got mud
on my face.

00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:10,296
[ chuckles ]
[ laughs ]

00:10:10,296 --> 00:10:11,765
Okay, okay, look, look, look.
Look, Lauren --

00:10:11,765 --> 00:10:13,535
I have companies
from China and Japan --

00:10:13,535 --> 00:10:16,809
I've looked for every possible
reason to -- to invest.

00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:18,111
I'm out.

00:10:18,111 --> 00:10:20,182
Thank you. Well, thank you all
for your time.

00:10:20,182 --> 00:10:21,552
Thanks, Lauren.
Thank you.

00:10:21,552 --> 00:10:22,554
Really appreciate it.

00:10:22,554 --> 00:10:24,692
Thank you.
Ciao.

00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:26,863
Good luck.
Ciao.

00:10:26,863 --> 00:10:31,673
I'm amazed that
she goes out alone and fishes.

00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,109
That is amazing.

00:10:33,109 --> 00:10:34,980
I think
I didn't get a deal today

00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,352
because my sales
just weren't strong enough,

00:10:37,352 --> 00:10:40,257
but I'm gonna charge on
and build the brand regardless.

00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,815
NARRATOR: Next into the tank
are entrepreneurs

00:10:51,815 --> 00:10:56,291
with a clever way to hide an
unsightly, everyday necessity.

00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,568
BARZMAN:
Hi, sharks.

00:11:01,568 --> 00:11:02,872
My name
is Mike Barzman.

00:11:02,872 --> 00:11:04,174
And I'm
Bryan O'Connell.

00:11:04,174 --> 00:11:05,978
And we're co-founders
of invisiplug.

00:11:05,978 --> 00:11:10,287
We're looking for $125,000
for 10% of our company.

00:11:10,287 --> 00:11:13,093
So, how many of you guys
own one of these?

00:11:13,093 --> 00:11:16,099
Just one of the basic,
ugly power strips

00:11:16,099 --> 00:11:17,836
that's a complete eyesore,
right?

00:11:17,836 --> 00:11:20,709
We've done something
a little different.

00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:22,780
Introducing invisiplug.

00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,920
Invisiplug is the first line
of surge protectors

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,194
designed to seamlessly blend in
to hardwood floors.

00:11:29,194 --> 00:11:30,896
Now, it's available
in three colors --

00:11:30,896 --> 00:11:33,770
light natural,
medium cherry, and dark oak,

00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:36,943
so it covers a wide variety
of hardwood flooring.

00:11:36,943 --> 00:11:38,513
We just
launched the product,

00:11:38,513 --> 00:11:40,150
and the response
has been overwhelming.

00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,786
So, let me ask you guys
a question.

00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:43,656
Who wants to get
into the power business?

00:11:43,656 --> 00:11:44,993
[ chuckles ]

00:11:44,993 --> 00:11:46,129
BARZMAN: Bryan, show them what
everyone's been talking about.

00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:47,766
Let me show you guys.

00:11:47,766 --> 00:11:49,536
So, sharks,
we need your investments,

00:11:49,536 --> 00:11:50,805
we need
your expertise...

00:11:50,805 --> 00:11:51,840
Thank you,
Bryan, thank you.

00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,043
...And we need
your relationships

00:11:53,043 --> 00:11:56,083
to help us as
we take this product to market.

00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:59,022
So, there are
some very big players

00:11:59,022 --> 00:12:01,327
making extension cords
that already have distribution.

00:12:01,327 --> 00:12:01,976
Sure.

00:12:01,976 --> 00:12:03,746
What is to stop them
from simply dyeing theirs

00:12:03,746 --> 00:12:05,450
and crushing you

00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,487
like the extension-cord
cockroaches you are?

00:12:07,487 --> 00:12:09,224
We have
a design patent

00:12:09,224 --> 00:12:10,795
that we actually received
on the process,

00:12:10,795 --> 00:12:14,633
so we're proprietary
with the wood-grain printing.

00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:16,972
So it's the look of the product
that's protected.

00:12:16,972 --> 00:12:18,141
Exactly, exactly.

00:12:18,141 --> 00:12:19,878
Somebody could make one
that looks like it

00:12:19,878 --> 00:12:21,046
using a different process,

00:12:21,046 --> 00:12:22,717
and the whole patent thing
doesn't matter.

00:12:22,717 --> 00:12:24,220
O'LEARY:
So this isn't protectable,

00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,723
so then it goes back
to my original question.

00:12:25,723 --> 00:12:29,030
The guys that own this space
that make hundreds of millions

00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,634
of these things
around the world,

00:12:30,634 --> 00:12:32,571
what's to stop them
from absolutely decimating

00:12:32,571 --> 00:12:34,775
this business if it ever
takes off in the first place?

00:12:34,775 --> 00:12:35,844
Well --
CUBAN: Because it's niche.

00:12:35,844 --> 00:12:36,980
There's no reason for them to.

00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,349
You mean it's never gonna be
a big business?

00:12:38,349 --> 00:12:39,886
Exactly, but the --

00:12:39,886 --> 00:12:41,857
it's not gonna be exciting
to invest in.
question -- what are --

00:12:41,857 --> 00:12:42,659
what are do you sell these for?
I'll never make any money.
is that what you're saying?

00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:44,362
Our retail price is $14.99.

00:12:44,362 --> 00:12:46,433
I didn't know
if you were gonna go --

00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:49,306
try to go high end so that
if you worked with designers

00:12:49,306 --> 00:12:53,080
and this was $249
because it was the only way

00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,884
to get the perfect look
on your floor,

00:12:54,884 --> 00:12:57,156
then I can see it, right?

00:12:57,156 --> 00:12:59,393
If it's a $14.99 product,

00:12:59,393 --> 00:13:01,097
it's gonna be perceived
as being inexpensive.

00:13:01,097 --> 00:13:03,535
It's not really gonna
be perceived as a
solution in my mind.

00:13:03,535 --> 00:13:05,673
I don't think
it's a real business.

00:13:05,673 --> 00:13:08,044
I'm out.

00:13:08,044 --> 00:13:10,483
I like the idea
that it's a $14.99 product

00:13:10,483 --> 00:13:13,055
and anybody could afford it,
but might I ask you,

00:13:13,055 --> 00:13:15,293
what do you pay
for a standard white one?

00:13:15,293 --> 00:13:16,496
$6 to $12.

00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:18,834
HERJAVEC: Bryan, how long
have you been selling it?

00:13:18,834 --> 00:13:19,836
6 1/2 weeks.

00:13:19,836 --> 00:13:21,840
The total amount
of units sold

00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,479
is just under 1,500 units
as of right now.

00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:25,882
What's the total sales
for that?

00:13:25,882 --> 00:13:28,020
The total gross sales
is over $10,000,

00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,825
and the total net
is just about $6,000.

00:13:30,825 --> 00:13:33,831
We're doing
a special design two pack,

00:13:33,831 --> 00:13:35,602
an exclusive product
for costco right now.

00:13:35,602 --> 00:13:38,909
They give us a purchase order
for around 3,000 units.

00:13:38,909 --> 00:13:42,984
If they do $500
of gross sales per week,

00:13:42,984 --> 00:13:47,695
they will order a starting order
of 120,000 two packs

00:13:47,695 --> 00:13:51,134
with a margin
that's about 78%.

00:13:51,134 --> 00:13:53,072
So, I'm a computer guy.
I buy a lot of these.

00:13:54,308 --> 00:13:56,212
I'm not sure
I see the market for it.

00:13:56,212 --> 00:13:58,483
I think most people
that buy these things

00:13:58,483 --> 00:14:01,022
put them behind a desk if
they don't like the look of them

00:14:01,022 --> 00:14:03,394
to try to hide them somewhere
'cause even with yours,

00:14:03,394 --> 00:14:05,031
even though
it's better-looking...

00:14:05,031 --> 00:14:06,433
O'CONNELL: Mm-hmm.
...I still see the cord.

00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:09,306
I still see the thing
on the floor.

00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,143
It blends in better,

00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:13,949
but it's still not
aesthetically pleasing to me.

00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:16,388
For that reason, I'm out.

00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:23,268
So, we have to pay you
$1.25 million valuation.

00:14:23,268 --> 00:14:26,041
I think
you're gonna sell some maybe,

00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:29,281
and if you do, good for you, but
it's not an investable business.

00:14:29,281 --> 00:14:32,287
And the price you've asked
in terms of the value is --

00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:34,426
is beyond insane.

00:14:34,426 --> 00:14:35,761
Well, and I --

00:14:35,761 --> 00:14:37,632
this is one of the classic
situations in "Shark Tank"

00:14:37,632 --> 00:14:38,934
where you come in thinking

00:14:38,934 --> 00:14:40,171
because you've lived
too close to it

00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:43,277
that it's worth
a million dollars -- $1 million.

00:14:44,345 --> 00:14:45,582
Don't ask a million bucks

00:14:45,582 --> 00:14:46,984
for something
that hasn't made any money yet.

00:14:46,984 --> 00:14:48,188
Sure.
What, are you guys nuts?!

00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:49,490
Come on!
Sure. Out of all respect,

00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,561
we have -- we have a budding
business that we believe --

00:14:51,561 --> 00:14:53,231
don't give him
any respect yet.
and we respect your criticism
and your success,

00:14:53,231 --> 00:14:55,536
and we have -- there's not --
and I appreciate your --
your thoughts.

00:14:55,536 --> 00:14:58,208
Listen, on this planet,
it's not worth a million bucks.

00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,578
On any other planet, it's not
worth a million bucks, okay?

00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:00,613
Sure it is.

00:15:00,613 --> 00:15:01,548
I'm out.

00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,258
I'm the perfect customer
for this product

00:15:06,258 --> 00:15:07,561
'cause my husband, Bill,

00:15:07,561 --> 00:15:08,930
probably buys
six of these a week,

00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:09,999
and I hate every one of them.

00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:11,169
[ laughter ]
Okay.

00:15:11,169 --> 00:15:12,705
He goes on a business trip.
I throw them out.

00:15:12,705 --> 00:15:14,642
He comes home.
He buys new ones.

00:15:14,642 --> 00:15:15,979
They're ugly.
That's hilarious.

00:15:15,979 --> 00:15:17,214
All right, I would like to buy
at least three dozen from you.

00:15:17,214 --> 00:15:18,818
That's fantastic.

00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:21,991
But your [sighs] the number
you put on this business

00:15:21,991 --> 00:15:23,895
Is nuts for a crapshoot.

00:15:23,895 --> 00:15:25,365
Basically, it's a crapshoot.

00:15:25,365 --> 00:15:27,670
I think you're gonna sell a lot,

00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,576
but why
would I give you $125,000

00:15:30,576 --> 00:15:32,346
for any percentage
to find out?

00:15:32,346 --> 00:15:33,682
So, I wish you luck,

00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,188
but I treasure my money
more than that.

00:15:36,188 --> 00:15:37,190
I'm out.

00:15:41,164 --> 00:15:42,734
Lori,
are there any questions?

00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:43,970
[ chuckles ]

00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,507
How much money
have you put into this?

00:15:45,507 --> 00:15:50,217
We have around $70,000
into the company to date.

00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:52,589
T-the real reason
we want the money

00:15:52,589 --> 00:15:54,926
is because of the o mag article
that's coming out.

00:15:54,926 --> 00:15:56,763
O as in
Oprah magazine?

00:15:56,763 --> 00:15:57,866
Yeah. Yes, yes,
Oprah magazine.

00:15:57,866 --> 00:15:59,035
Wow.

00:15:59,035 --> 00:16:00,271
Oprah magazine
is featuring this.

00:16:00,271 --> 00:16:02,041
As a new pro--
in their new-products section.

00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,012
O'CONNELL: Yeah, yeah.
Okay, you will sell out.

00:16:04,012 --> 00:16:05,014
I hope so.

00:16:05,014 --> 00:16:06,251
God willing,
a-a-and that's

00:16:06,251 --> 00:16:08,255
what we are kind of basing
a lot of our belief on,

00:16:08,255 --> 00:16:09,557
you know,
with our product,

00:16:09,557 --> 00:16:11,594
and the response
has been nothing but positive

00:16:11,594 --> 00:16:13,431
from all these big-box people,
you know?

00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,336
Impressive activity.
Thank you so much.

00:16:15,336 --> 00:16:17,741
Thank you.
I'm gonna make you an offer.

00:16:17,741 --> 00:16:21,115
I'll give you the $125,000
for 10%,

00:16:21,115 --> 00:16:24,589
but I want a dollar
per unit sold...

00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:28,497
Until I make back my $125,000.

00:16:28,497 --> 00:16:29,732
Mm-hmm.

00:16:29,732 --> 00:16:31,636
And then I want 50 cents
forever thereafter.

00:16:31,636 --> 00:16:33,875
Now, did you say
in perpetuity?

00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,344
Yes.
Yes, yes.

00:16:35,344 --> 00:16:36,480
CUBAN:
She said forever.

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,584
Yes, what it is,
is I want protection.

00:16:38,584 --> 00:16:40,355
That's a Kevin deal.
O'LEARY: That's right.

00:16:40,355 --> 00:16:41,590
That is a Kevin deal.

00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:42,693
CORCORAN: No, if it's insulting,
it's a Kevin deal.

00:16:42,693 --> 00:16:43,896
No, no, never.

00:16:43,896 --> 00:16:45,398
Kevin never insults.

00:16:45,398 --> 00:16:46,668
[ laughs ]

00:16:46,668 --> 00:16:48,405
O'LEARY: You want protection.
You need surge protection.

00:16:48,405 --> 00:16:49,808
Because I don't --
I need surge protection.

00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:50,810
I need investment protection.

00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,080
Absolutely.

00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,184
Because you have a lot
of fish on the hook.

00:16:54,184 --> 00:16:55,586
Thank you.
But I'm not sure.

00:16:55,586 --> 00:16:57,290
You don't have proven sales.

00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,493
Sure.

00:16:58,493 --> 00:17:00,864
So it's as big a gamble for me
as it is for you.

00:17:00,864 --> 00:17:03,971
So that's why I'm structuring
the deal this way.

00:17:03,971 --> 00:17:05,440
Well, absolutely,
and you can understand

00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,710
that for a company
in our infancy,

00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:10,217
it's so hard to put
a real valuation on our company.

00:17:10,217 --> 00:17:13,424
If we pull the trigger
on that costco order,

00:17:13,424 --> 00:17:15,328
that's over a million dollars
in net profit,

00:17:15,328 --> 00:17:16,563
and that's
just one order.

00:17:16,563 --> 00:17:19,504
Tell me if this
is too much of a counter

00:17:19,504 --> 00:17:22,175
along the lines
of 25 cents per unit

00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,614
until you recoup
your investment

00:17:24,614 --> 00:17:27,286
and then a possible 5-
or a 10-cent --

00:17:27,286 --> 00:17:31,060
possibly, and I'd have to call
our advisor -- royalty.

00:17:34,768 --> 00:17:38,576
So, here's going to be
my final offer.

00:17:38,576 --> 00:17:41,182
$125,000.

00:17:41,182 --> 00:17:45,291
I do want the dollar per unit
until I make back my $125,000,

00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:49,332
but then I'll go to 25 cents
in perpetuity

00:17:49,332 --> 00:17:51,403
off of each unit sold.

00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,739
10% equity.

00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:55,044
I understand it's a steep deal,

00:17:55,044 --> 00:17:58,218
but it's what it will take
to get me in.

00:17:58,218 --> 00:18:00,755
A-are you at all willing
to negotiate on the perpetuity?

00:18:00,755 --> 00:18:01,992
I'm not.
Not at all?

00:18:01,992 --> 00:18:03,529
I'm not.

00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:06,602
You're nice guys, but it's what
I feel I need to make the deal.

00:18:06,602 --> 00:18:09,241
Okay, guys, you got her to go
down from 50 cents in perpetuity

00:18:09,241 --> 00:18:10,409
down to a quarter.

00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:11,880
I don't think
it's an unreasonable offer,

00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,048
to be honest with you...
no.

00:18:13,048 --> 00:18:14,451
Sure, sure.
...Where you are today.

00:18:14,451 --> 00:18:15,988
HERJAVEC: You know what?
The more you're talking...

00:18:15,988 --> 00:18:17,257
Mm-hmm.

00:18:17,257 --> 00:18:19,195
...The more impressed
I've been getting up here.

00:18:19,195 --> 00:18:20,364
Oh, thank you.
Are you going to make an offer?

00:18:20,364 --> 00:18:22,535
Coming back in?

00:18:29,917 --> 00:18:31,887
NARRATOR:
Four sharks are out.

00:18:31,887 --> 00:18:33,992
Mike and Bryan
have an offer from Lori,

00:18:33,992 --> 00:18:35,896
but Robert may come back in.

00:18:35,896 --> 00:18:37,600
HERJAVEC: You know what?
The more you're talking...

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,869
Mm-hmm.

00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:40,306
...The more impressed
I've been getting up here.

00:18:40,306 --> 00:18:41,474
O'CONNELL: Oh, thank you.
Are you going to make an offer?

00:18:41,474 --> 00:18:43,478
Coming back in?

00:18:43,478 --> 00:18:45,583
Yeah, I'll make you an offer.

00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,786
Thank you.
Oh, thank you, sir.

00:18:46,786 --> 00:18:48,021
I don't think
that the business

00:18:48,021 --> 00:18:49,658
can afford the royalty
right now,

00:18:49,658 --> 00:18:52,497
and I think you're willing
to give up a little more equity.

00:18:52,497 --> 00:18:57,074
I'll give you the $125,000
for 25% straight in, no royalty,

00:18:57,074 --> 00:18:59,244
and we're in this together.

00:18:59,244 --> 00:19:02,418
"Boom"
goes the dynamite!

00:19:02,418 --> 00:19:03,454
O'LEARY: Wow!

00:19:03,454 --> 00:19:04,923
Hey, and I got to tell you,
you --

00:19:04,923 --> 00:19:06,126
Robert,
thank you for that offer.

00:19:06,126 --> 00:19:07,128
You convinced me.

00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,069
Are you at all negotiable
on what you gave us?

00:19:11,069 --> 00:19:12,973
Would you consider
coming down to 20%?

00:19:14,343 --> 00:19:18,485
I'll do the 20%
if you do the deal right now.

00:19:18,485 --> 00:19:21,257
Interesting.

00:19:21,257 --> 00:19:23,228
$125,000, 20%.

00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:24,998
Let's do it.

00:19:26,568 --> 00:19:28,639
Can we still go back
and make a phone call?

00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,909
Oh, man!

00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:30,911
No.
What did I just say?

00:19:30,911 --> 00:19:32,548
He just said
this was the deal right now.

00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:34,151
What do you want
to do?

00:19:34,151 --> 00:19:35,688
Um...
3...

00:19:35,688 --> 00:19:38,193
2...

00:19:38,193 --> 00:19:40,297
1...
[ murmurs ]

00:19:40,297 --> 00:19:41,801
yeah.

00:19:43,203 --> 00:19:44,640
We -- we'd like
to step back,

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,076
a-and we understand
that you're out.

00:19:46,076 --> 00:19:48,281
[ all groaning ]
I'm out.

00:19:48,281 --> 00:19:49,316
Whoa!

00:19:49,316 --> 00:19:50,618
I think you're down
to one offer.

00:19:52,322 --> 00:19:54,159
So,
to recap then,

00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:57,567
you're offering $125,000
for 10%, plus...

00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,103
Dollar per unit...
...Dollar per unit till --

00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,274
...until I recover.
and then 25 cents...

00:20:01,274 --> 00:20:02,744
And then 25 cents
per unit...

00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:04,414
...In perpetuity.
...In perpetuity.

00:20:04,414 --> 00:20:07,988
Is there any room
on the royalty portion,

00:20:07,988 --> 00:20:10,260
even, say, 5 cents
just to show a good faith

00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,531
that you really believe
in what we're doing?

00:20:12,531 --> 00:20:14,435
You'll walk away
with the 20 cents.

00:20:14,435 --> 00:20:15,938
You'll get
the dollar back.

00:20:15,938 --> 00:20:17,207
You'll have your equity.

00:20:17,207 --> 00:20:19,245
And because of who you are
and your partnerships,

00:20:19,245 --> 00:20:20,648
we would love
to take that deal,

00:20:20,648 --> 00:20:22,118
and we think
that we could really do well

00:20:22,118 --> 00:20:23,521
with you
in the future.

00:20:23,521 --> 00:20:28,598
You guys, I really -- I respect
everything you've done,

00:20:28,598 --> 00:20:31,604
but I did say that
that was my final offer.

00:20:31,604 --> 00:20:32,740
Okay.

00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,742
And so it is --

00:20:33,742 --> 00:20:35,445
then we'd like
to take it.

00:20:35,445 --> 00:20:36,782
Okay.
You've got a deal, Lori.

00:20:36,782 --> 00:20:37,984
CUBAN: Congrats, guys.
Nice.

00:20:37,984 --> 00:20:39,020
[ laughter ]
[ whistling ]

00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,155
We're gonna sell
a lot of plugs.

00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,358
It's a pleasure
to be in business.

00:20:41,358 --> 00:20:42,594
I hope so. I hope so.
[ laughs ]

00:20:42,594 --> 00:20:43,763
how about a hug?
[ laughter ]

00:20:43,763 --> 00:20:44,765
thank you, Lori.
okay.

00:20:44,765 --> 00:20:45,834
Cool.
We look forward to it.

00:20:45,834 --> 00:20:47,237
CUBAN: Congrats, guys.
We'll talk soon.

00:20:47,237 --> 00:20:48,506
CORCORAN: Ciao.

00:20:48,506 --> 00:20:50,176
Good to see you guys.
Thank you so much.

00:20:50,176 --> 00:20:51,546
We got Lori. Whoo!
That was great.

00:20:51,546 --> 00:20:52,915
Well, you got yourself
a good deal.

00:20:52,915 --> 00:20:54,352
That's a great deal
for you.

00:20:54,352 --> 00:20:55,821
It's not even that bad for them.
And I'll support them totally.

00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:56,924
It's not even that bad
for them.

00:20:56,924 --> 00:20:58,260
Good business
is always good business.

00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,562
We got
what we wanted.
It's awesome.

00:20:59,562 --> 00:21:01,199
You know,
we gave up a little,

00:21:01,199 --> 00:21:02,803
tiny bit more,
but we did it.

00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,673
Yeah, that's really good.
[ laughs ]

00:21:09,116 --> 00:21:11,772
NARRATOR: Last season,
Corey Ward and Trew Quackenbush

00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:14,928
impressed the sharks and closed
a deal with Barbara Corcoran

00:21:14,928 --> 00:21:17,667
for their grilled-cheese
restaurant franchise Tom+Chee.

00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:18,837
I'd say
we take the deal.

00:21:18,837 --> 00:21:19,839
HERJAVEC: Yes, sir!
All right.

00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:21,308
Thank you, guys, so much.
Awesome.

00:21:21,308 --> 00:21:23,178
Let's see
what they're up to now.

00:21:23,178 --> 00:21:24,248
[ sizzling ]

00:21:24,248 --> 00:21:26,452
Oh, it's a great-looking
sandwich, gentlemen.

00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:29,125
Since being on "Shark Tank,"
our sales have been insane.

00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,494
WARD:
Before "Shark Tank,"

00:21:30,494 --> 00:21:32,131
it took us a year to reach
a million dollars in sales,

00:21:32,131 --> 00:21:33,467
and in three months
since the show,

00:21:33,467 --> 00:21:35,304
we've already
gone over a million dollars.

00:21:35,304 --> 00:21:36,373
What can I
get you today?

00:21:36,373 --> 00:21:37,709
WARD:
Before "Shark Tank,"

00:21:37,709 --> 00:21:39,479
we only had 40 employees
in 3 locations.

00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:41,550
Since the show's aired,
we're up to 80 employees

00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,555
across six locations
and our corporate offices.

00:21:43,555 --> 00:21:46,060
That's 100% job creation
in just 3 months.

00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,465
Well, I want to welcome
everybody to the family.

00:21:48,465 --> 00:21:49,835
Today,
we're closing deals

00:21:49,835 --> 00:21:51,571
with our first three franchisees
since "Shark Tank."

00:21:51,571 --> 00:21:53,308
we're gonna now have tom+chee

00:21:53,308 --> 00:21:55,780
in New Jersey, Tennessee,
and Kentucky.

00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,016
Hello, everybody.

00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:58,853
ALL:
Hey, Barbara!

00:21:58,853 --> 00:22:00,457
I'm so happy to be with you,

00:22:00,457 --> 00:22:03,362
and I'm so excited
to meet your first franchisees.

00:22:03,362 --> 00:22:04,833
Working with Barbara
has been great.

00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:07,137
She's understood our business
model from the very beginning,

00:22:07,137 --> 00:22:08,741
and she's made herself
available to us

00:22:08,741 --> 00:22:10,211
whether it's through
e-mails, video chats.

00:22:10,211 --> 00:22:11,513
She's there
to answer our questions,

00:22:11,513 --> 00:22:13,016
and we do have
a lot of them.

00:22:13,016 --> 00:22:14,787
I would like a Barbara blue,
please.

00:22:14,787 --> 00:22:16,491
Just like we promised
on "Shark Tank,"

00:22:16,491 --> 00:22:18,093
the shark
that invested in tom+chee

00:22:18,093 --> 00:22:19,663
would get a sandwich
on the board,

00:22:19,663 --> 00:22:21,734
and Barbara did,
so she got the Barbara blue --

00:22:21,734 --> 00:22:24,440
smoked ham, Brie cheese,
blueberry compote

00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,779
all on a yeast-glazed donut.
it's amazing.

00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:27,781
[ laughs ]

00:22:27,781 --> 00:22:28,983
Our "Shark Tank"
experience

00:22:28,983 --> 00:22:30,720
has been a roller coaster
of emotion.

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,557
To think that we started
in a street tent

00:22:32,557 --> 00:22:34,929
and now what the future
holds for us just blows us away.

00:22:34,929 --> 00:22:37,367
ALL:
Thank you, "Shark Tank"!

00:22:37,367 --> 00:22:38,737
[ all cheering ]

00:22:47,722 --> 00:22:50,595
NARRATOR: Next up are two dads
who've created a product

00:22:50,595 --> 00:22:52,666
designed to keep students
organized.

00:23:00,683 --> 00:23:01,852
Hello, sharks.

00:23:01,852 --> 00:23:03,655
I am Greg Cronin
from Clinton, Mississippi.

00:23:03,655 --> 00:23:05,226
And I'm
Dr. Stephen Coachys.

00:23:05,226 --> 00:23:06,929
I'm from
Ridgeland, Mississippi.

00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:12,240
We are seeking $175,000
for a 10% stake in our company.

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,045
Sharks,
that is called disorganitis.

00:23:15,045 --> 00:23:16,916
GREINER: [ chuckles ]

00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:18,386
There are three symptoms --

00:23:18,386 --> 00:23:22,127
lost homework, being late
for class, and falling grades.

00:23:22,127 --> 00:23:26,536
But I have found the cure,
and it is lockerbones.

00:23:26,536 --> 00:23:29,175
Sharks,
this is a simple product

00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:32,683
that eliminates the mess,
reduces the stress.

00:23:32,683 --> 00:23:34,553
Lockerbones is the best.

00:23:34,553 --> 00:23:35,722
And remember,

00:23:35,722 --> 00:23:38,595
an organized student
is a successful student.

00:23:38,595 --> 00:23:41,234
So, sharks,
come one, come all,

00:23:41,234 --> 00:23:44,775
but join us in improving
the organizational skills

00:23:44,775 --> 00:23:48,849
of our future leaders with
the ninth wonder of the world...

00:23:48,849 --> 00:23:50,186
BOTH: Lockerbones!

00:23:50,186 --> 00:23:51,588
[ chuckles ]
It'll take just a moment,

00:23:51,588 --> 00:23:52,959
But I'd like
to take this out,

00:23:52,959 --> 00:23:54,161
put it right back,
and you'll see

00:23:54,161 --> 00:23:55,496
exactly how it all happens.
that'll be helpful.

00:23:55,496 --> 00:23:56,733
Yeah, yeah,
I'd like to see that.
All right.

00:23:56,733 --> 00:23:58,737
COACHYS: Want you to know
as he's putting that together

00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:00,774
that there are no tools that
are needed with this at all.

00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:02,044
30 seconds --
it's in and out.

00:24:02,044 --> 00:24:03,046
What does one cost?

00:24:03,046 --> 00:24:04,248
Yeah,
but what does it cost?

00:24:04,248 --> 00:24:06,419
[ laughing ] Yeah.
A single is $29.95,

00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:09,727
and a double, which is normally
the 12-inch, is $39.95.

00:24:09,727 --> 00:24:12,299
This might show you
the patented product.

00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:14,403
Aren't kids gonna make that
in woodshop?

00:24:14,403 --> 00:24:15,773
Not a chance.
[ laughter ]

00:24:15,773 --> 00:24:17,309
no, you know what? there's
a lot of cuts in that, Mark.

00:24:17,309 --> 00:24:18,679
COACHYS: Actually -- actually,
they might, but they can't.

00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:20,416
There's a lot of precision
to this. [ chuckles ]

00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:21,718
they can't make that,
Mark.

00:24:21,718 --> 00:24:23,489
The reason is, is because
that has been patented.

00:24:23,489 --> 00:24:26,661
Oh, so, you're gonna sue
a bunch of 7th graders.

00:24:26,661 --> 00:24:28,065
How'd we get involved
in that?

00:24:28,065 --> 00:24:30,470
No, we are gonna get 7th graders
to put that in their locker.

00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,006
They're gonna have it,
no problem.

00:24:32,006 --> 00:24:33,343
You know, honestly,
it's just easier to buy it.

00:24:33,343 --> 00:24:34,478
Absolutely.

00:24:34,478 --> 00:24:36,917
Once you take the two sides,
settle them in,

00:24:36,917 --> 00:24:38,921
you take one piece,
and you put it

00:24:38,921 --> 00:24:41,460
at any location you want
on that track system.

00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,664
This becomes
the first vertical divider

00:24:43,664 --> 00:24:46,437
in a locker because what happens
is, folders fall over.

00:24:46,437 --> 00:24:48,074
They get on top
of each other.

00:24:48,074 --> 00:24:49,944
You can't really
keep things standing up.

00:24:49,944 --> 00:24:51,681
You slide it in.
You put it in place.

00:24:51,681 --> 00:24:52,850
So, nobody else...

00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:54,754
You now have vertical ability
to hold the shelves.

00:24:54,754 --> 00:24:55,756
And here's a question.

00:24:55,756 --> 00:24:56,958
Nobody else,
your competitors...

00:24:56,958 --> 00:24:58,261
Right.

00:24:58,261 --> 00:25:00,032
...Do not have
a vertical divider?
They do not.

00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:02,069
And here comes your nook
and cranny.

00:25:02,069 --> 00:25:03,138
You get two of these.

00:25:03,138 --> 00:25:05,743
You can put them
anywhere you would like.

00:25:05,743 --> 00:25:07,647
You can put reading books.

00:25:07,647 --> 00:25:09,384
You can put
your cellphone.

00:25:09,384 --> 00:25:11,555
Let me tell you
just briefly how this began.

00:25:11,555 --> 00:25:12,625
About four years ago,

00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:13,961
my daughter
was going to middle school.

00:25:13,961 --> 00:25:15,130
It was
the night before

00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,566
she needed her locker
organized the next morning.

00:25:16,566 --> 00:25:18,237
I went out
to the garage,

00:25:18,237 --> 00:25:20,040
took my table saw
out the back porch,

00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,510
and I created
the first one.

00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:24,215
I'm a contractor and
a developer, so I had the tools.

00:25:24,215 --> 00:25:25,418
It was,
uh, you know,

00:25:25,418 --> 00:25:27,523
rough around the edges
but very functional.

00:25:27,523 --> 00:25:29,627
So, she woke up
the next morning, looked at it,

00:25:29,627 --> 00:25:31,664
and goes, "Dad,
I'm not taking this to school."

00:25:31,664 --> 00:25:33,034
Exactly.

00:25:33,034 --> 00:25:35,105
CRONIN: But she knows me,
and we've done this many times.

00:25:35,105 --> 00:25:37,209
Kids never appreciate
anything we do for them ever.

00:25:37,209 --> 00:25:38,479
No.

00:25:38,479 --> 00:25:40,683
Well, the telling sign was,
two girls walk behind us --

00:25:40,683 --> 00:25:43,022
first day at a new school --
and they looked, and they said,

00:25:43,022 --> 00:25:44,391
"Cool. where'd you get
that wooden one?"

00:25:44,391 --> 00:25:46,428
We made
about eight or nine of them

00:25:46,428 --> 00:25:48,867
for just close people she
had met that first little bit,

00:25:48,867 --> 00:25:50,904
but then the school
organizational director,

00:25:50,904 --> 00:25:52,775
the one who goes
and checks the lockers,

00:25:52,775 --> 00:25:55,247
contacted me and said,
"This is -- this really works.

00:25:55,247 --> 00:25:56,349
It's functional."

00:25:56,349 --> 00:25:58,086
and he ordered 500 of them
on the spot.

00:25:58,086 --> 00:25:59,322
We got 60 orders.

00:25:59,322 --> 00:26:01,393
COACHYS: We have more parents
come to us and say,

00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,932
"Why didn't we have that
when we were in school?"

00:26:03,932 --> 00:26:05,702
how many parents
have you sold them to?

00:26:05,702 --> 00:26:07,572
We've sold 500 units.

00:26:07,572 --> 00:26:10,278
How long
have you been selling?

00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:12,216
Two years
of this particular version.

00:26:13,652 --> 00:26:18,362
We are here to request the money
to produce this in plastic.

00:26:18,362 --> 00:26:21,902
What's your tooling gonna cost
to do this in plastic?

00:26:21,902 --> 00:26:25,710
We paid approximately $28,000
to tool up

00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,547
for the previous one
on a prior effort...

00:26:27,547 --> 00:26:28,549
On a prior one.

00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:29,619
It did not work.
...That failed.

00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:33,192
You never got distribution.

00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:34,963
GREINER: Wait, wait.
Let him -- let him talk.

00:26:34,963 --> 00:26:36,566
This was --
this was a prototype, okay?

00:26:36,566 --> 00:26:37,769
It's an entrepreneur's thing.
We failed.

00:26:37,769 --> 00:26:38,872
That's fine.
CUBAN: Why did it fail?

00:26:38,872 --> 00:26:40,876
Yeah, why?
We went in -- because it was --

00:26:40,876 --> 00:26:42,613
it did not have
any of this track system.

00:26:42,613 --> 00:26:44,583
What we've done is,
two years ago,

00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:46,287
we came up
with this design.

00:26:46,287 --> 00:26:49,260
We got the design patent
in early July of 2011.

00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,531
Do you have a utility patent
or just a design?

00:26:51,531 --> 00:26:52,867
This is
a design patent.
Just a design.

00:26:52,867 --> 00:26:54,805
O'LEARY:
You've had it for four years.

00:26:54,805 --> 00:26:56,909
Why isn't it ubiquitous
in distribution?

00:26:56,909 --> 00:26:58,713
We've only -- no, we've only
had this for two years.

00:26:58,713 --> 00:27:00,516
You've had this --
you've had this for two years,

00:27:00,516 --> 00:27:02,420
and you've sold 500 units.
two years is a long time.

00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,957
Right. This is
one school year last year

00:27:03,957 --> 00:27:05,694
was when we introduced
this design, okay?

00:27:05,694 --> 00:27:07,598
Did you go into the school
and show it?

00:27:07,598 --> 00:27:10,070
We have 500 in this school,
which is 60% penetration.

00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,773
I am so confused!
Me too. God.

00:27:11,773 --> 00:27:13,043
Yeah, I want to --
just let me finish.

00:27:13,043 --> 00:27:14,245
O'LEARY:
When you got in front of the --

00:27:14,245 --> 00:27:15,682
we're all
still confused.

00:27:15,682 --> 00:27:17,519
I want to hear where you're
in front of the Staples buyer

00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:19,223
and you say, "Look at
this fantastic locker system,"

00:27:19,223 --> 00:27:21,928
and he or she says...
what do they say?

00:27:21,928 --> 00:27:23,364
Okay, Kevin...
Yes.

00:27:23,364 --> 00:27:26,237
...We have been in front
of a major retailer, okay?

00:27:26,237 --> 00:27:28,174
I'm getting excited.
That's one.

00:27:28,174 --> 00:27:30,312
They loved the product
in plastic.

00:27:30,312 --> 00:27:31,948
They loved
the function.

00:27:31,948 --> 00:27:34,955
We have a contract
that has been negotiated,

00:27:34,955 --> 00:27:37,928
put in place, okay,
for a 10,000-unit order

00:27:37,928 --> 00:27:39,832
from the largest
online retailer

00:27:39,832 --> 00:27:41,803
that will fulfill them
themselves

00:27:41,803 --> 00:27:44,208
of this product
the way it is.

00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:45,277
Right.
Okay?

00:27:45,277 --> 00:27:46,713
Who is it?
It is Amazon.

00:27:46,713 --> 00:27:48,116
Up to a million,
up to a million.

00:27:48,116 --> 00:27:49,218
Okay? This is
for the wood version.

00:27:49,218 --> 00:27:50,220
CRONIN:
That's for the wood version.

00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,457
Now --
they're fine with that.

00:27:51,457 --> 00:27:53,260
It is a contract that's been
exchanged but not executed.

00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,896
O'LEARY: What? Why?!

00:27:54,896 --> 00:27:57,635
We do not have the ability
to fulfill that 10,000

00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:58,905
'cause we do not
have the capital

00:27:58,905 --> 00:28:00,476
to put the inventory in place
at this time.

00:28:00,476 --> 00:28:01,678
Okay, I got it. I'm interested.
They're waiting.

00:28:01,678 --> 00:28:02,980
I got it, I got it, got it.
So, go to the next.

00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,617
All right,
now next to retail.

00:28:04,617 --> 00:28:06,521
Staples sells 30%
of school supplies.

00:28:06,521 --> 00:28:07,791
We have not
approached them.

00:28:07,791 --> 00:28:11,431
What?!
You never called them?

00:28:11,431 --> 00:28:14,438
No.

00:28:14,438 --> 00:28:16,308
W-- no!
Wait a minute.

00:28:16,308 --> 00:28:17,310
No!
Wait, wait, wait.

00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,248
Are you kidding?

00:28:19,248 --> 00:28:20,851
Hold on. Let me --

00:28:20,851 --> 00:28:21,987
wait a second.

00:28:21,987 --> 00:28:24,224
I let this product stay
in one pilot school

00:28:24,224 --> 00:28:26,296
on purpose
for one more year.

00:28:26,296 --> 00:28:27,465
So, you didn't want to sell it.

00:28:27,465 --> 00:28:28,567
So, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Now hold on.

00:28:28,567 --> 00:28:29,569
You have it on Amazon!
You stopped selling.

00:28:29,569 --> 00:28:30,772
COACHYS:
No, we don't have it there.

00:28:30,772 --> 00:28:31,941
CORCORAN: What happened?
GREINER: Wait.

00:28:31,941 --> 00:28:33,845
I have to execute you now.

00:28:39,857 --> 00:28:42,931
I let this product stay
in one pilot school

00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:45,035
on purpose
for one more year.

00:28:45,035 --> 00:28:46,305
So, you didn't want to sell it.

00:28:46,305 --> 00:28:47,407
So, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Now hold on.

00:28:47,407 --> 00:28:49,009
You have it on Amazon!
You stopped selling.

00:28:49,009 --> 00:28:50,046
COACHYS: No, we don't have it
there right now.

00:28:50,046 --> 00:28:51,181
CORCORAN: What happened?
GREINER: Wait.

00:28:51,181 --> 00:28:52,650
I have to execute you now.

00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:55,323
A design patent
is not extremely strong.

00:28:55,323 --> 00:28:58,330
Until you can go quick
and fast in this market --

00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,999
they can buy one at Amazon
and knock it out.

00:28:59,999 --> 00:29:01,369
You need to make it
out of plastic.

00:29:01,369 --> 00:29:02,906
No, he doesn't.
And you need
to bring the price down.

00:29:02,906 --> 00:29:04,008
Yes, he does.
Wood is too expensive.

00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:05,143
CRONIN:
Yes, we do, and that's what --

00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:06,279
he's got to change the color,
as well.

00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:08,016
That's what Staples
and office depot want.

00:29:08,016 --> 00:29:09,018
They --
how do you know that?

00:29:09,018 --> 00:29:10,288
Office Depot
wants it.

00:29:10,288 --> 00:29:11,557
How do you know that?
COACHYS: They --

00:29:11,557 --> 00:29:12,626
you never called them.

00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:14,731
And there's another
large retailer.

00:29:14,731 --> 00:29:16,968
All they want
is it in plastic and color.

00:29:16,968 --> 00:29:18,505
I really want
to nail this down...

00:29:18,505 --> 00:29:20,074
Sure.
...Because this matters a lot.

00:29:20,074 --> 00:29:21,177
Certainly, absolutely.

00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:22,847
Amazon's going to buy
from you,

00:29:22,847 --> 00:29:25,754
and they are saying,
"I am going to buy up front.

00:29:25,754 --> 00:29:27,858
Here's a pledge."
how much?

00:29:27,858 --> 00:29:30,497
10,000 units,
up to a million units.

00:29:30,497 --> 00:29:32,701
We ship to them.

00:29:32,701 --> 00:29:34,939
They warehouse it.
They sell it.

00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,542
They have terms.
They pay us later.

00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:38,614
This is not a P.O.
from a traditional retailer.

00:29:38,614 --> 00:29:41,118
But, Greg, if they don't sell
it, you have to bring it back.

00:29:41,118 --> 00:29:42,120
You do.
I got it.

00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,390
It's a consignment offer.

00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,528
It's a consignment offer, yeah,
very much.

00:29:46,596 --> 00:29:50,071
All right, I love the proof
of concept, but let's be honest.

00:29:50,071 --> 00:29:51,774
You're at the very beginning.

00:29:51,774 --> 00:29:53,177
We are ready
to go to the world now.

00:29:53,177 --> 00:29:54,180
No, I got it.
Correct.

00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,449
I'm ready to go,
too.

00:29:55,449 --> 00:29:57,019
COACHYS: Absolutely.
We want you to come with us.

00:29:57,019 --> 00:29:58,856
[ laughter ]
I like to go on a trip.

00:29:58,856 --> 00:30:00,593
Which world
are you all going to?

00:30:00,593 --> 00:30:03,264
Why is the company
worth $1.75 million?

00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,703
There are 98,000 schools
in the United States.

00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:07,574
110,000.
Okay.

00:30:07,574 --> 00:30:12,317
There are approximately
50 million school lockers.

00:30:12,317 --> 00:30:15,223
Okay, so, your valuat--
if you take only .05%
of the market --

00:30:15,223 --> 00:30:17,928
Greg, your valuation is based on
size of market. got it.

00:30:17,928 --> 00:30:19,933
Size of market, .05% of 1%.
Not sure I like that answer,

00:30:19,933 --> 00:30:22,639
but let me ask you a second
question -- my final question.

00:30:22,639 --> 00:30:26,246
Where does my $175,000
get you to?

00:30:26,246 --> 00:30:29,853
Does it get the product
into Staples?

00:30:29,853 --> 00:30:31,792
Yes.
I'm gonna tell you yes,
and this is how.

00:30:31,792 --> 00:30:33,561
One,
tooling gets done.

00:30:33,561 --> 00:30:34,898
Okay.

00:30:34,898 --> 00:30:37,470
Two, initial inventory is what
we'll be using the money for.

00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:40,276
To fill purchase orders
or just to build inventory?

00:30:40,276 --> 00:30:42,213
Well, he doesn't have
the orders.

00:30:42,213 --> 00:30:43,415
He has to go out --

00:30:43,415 --> 00:30:45,452
we're gonna go execute the order
we have on the table

00:30:45,452 --> 00:30:47,323
with the confidence
we can fulfill it.

00:30:47,323 --> 00:30:48,459
CUBAN: I'm gonna simplify it
here, guys.

00:30:48,459 --> 00:30:50,397
Where you've killed it...

00:30:50,397 --> 00:30:53,804
Is selling it in schools,
where it catches fire.

00:30:53,804 --> 00:30:55,440
It's viral.
The kids love it.

00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,983
But no discussion whatsoever
of selling it in the same manner

00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,820
to the 110,000 schools.

00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,961
All you have to do is go to the
middle school down the street

00:31:04,961 --> 00:31:07,365
and wait for the orders and
then just go to one more school,

00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,902
kill it again.

00:31:08,902 --> 00:31:11,875
Go to one more school, not this
big consignment order to Amazon

00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:13,912
where you could take
all your inventory.

00:31:13,912 --> 00:31:16,517
It could all be sent back
if it doesn't sell through.

00:31:16,517 --> 00:31:18,154
Respectfully -- respectfully,
we were not finished...

00:31:18,154 --> 00:31:19,825
You know what, Mark?
There's nothing wrong
with what they did.

00:31:19,825 --> 00:31:21,362
...With the response
to him,

00:31:21,362 --> 00:31:22,697
and I know I didn't
give it quick enough
till we got an answer.

00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:24,768
Yeah, no, I don't think
you're on the wrong track, Greg.

00:31:24,768 --> 00:31:26,639
CUBAN: You're following
the dream, not the green,

00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:28,609
so for that reason, I'm out.

00:31:28,609 --> 00:31:30,446
HERJAVEC:
You know what? He is so wrong.

00:31:30,446 --> 00:31:31,816
Robert and I don't agree
with that at all.

00:31:31,816 --> 00:31:33,253
O'LEARY: Well, wait a second.
Wait a second.

00:31:33,253 --> 00:31:37,428
Hear me on this -- New York,
Florida, Texas, California.

00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:39,733
That's where
all the schools are, okay?

00:31:39,733 --> 00:31:42,405
What you want to do
is sell 10% of the lockers

00:31:42,405 --> 00:31:45,312
in those four states,
and you'll be filthy rich!

00:31:45,312 --> 00:31:48,718
Great product,
but you didn't talk about

00:31:48,718 --> 00:31:51,792
a distribution strategy
for just getting to the schools.

00:31:51,792 --> 00:31:52,827
I'm out.

00:31:55,766 --> 00:31:58,472
What I think you're doing here
is nuts!

00:31:58,472 --> 00:32:00,811
I think you could get every kid
in every school

00:32:00,811 --> 00:32:03,282
to be peddling for you,
and they're easy to recruit

00:32:03,282 --> 00:32:05,721
'cause they're not looking
for a lot of money.

00:32:05,721 --> 00:32:08,360
You're missing
the best opportunity.

00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,562
I'm out.

00:32:09,562 --> 00:32:13,069
Three sharks out,
two still in.

00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,679
Let me -- let me tell you
where I'm at

00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,752
'cause I-I think I've heard
enough to make a decision.

00:32:20,752 --> 00:32:25,228
The idea of selling on Amazon
on consignment...

00:32:25,228 --> 00:32:26,631
It's nuts!

00:32:28,535 --> 00:32:30,272
Staples has 30% of the market.

00:32:30,272 --> 00:32:33,645
To me, the path is very simple.
Get it to Staples.

00:32:35,082 --> 00:32:36,752
I like the product.

00:32:36,752 --> 00:32:38,823
It's probably the best product
I've seen for this application.

00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:40,693
COACHYS: You will have to
buy one, Robert.
Hang on.

00:32:40,693 --> 00:32:42,164
I don't want to do this deal
on my own, okay?

00:32:42,164 --> 00:32:43,934
Okay. All right.

00:32:43,934 --> 00:32:45,336
I think
Lori's interested in it.

00:32:45,336 --> 00:32:46,338
Okay.

00:32:46,338 --> 00:32:49,111
I'll give you $87,500 --

00:32:49,111 --> 00:32:52,819
half the money
you're looking for -- for 25%.

00:32:52,819 --> 00:32:54,255
Lori,
if she'd like to do it...

00:32:54,255 --> 00:32:55,524
[ laughs ]
...It's up to her.

00:32:55,524 --> 00:32:58,665
$87,500
for the other 25%.

00:32:58,665 --> 00:33:01,804
Let me be clear before the other
people start making fun of it

00:33:01,804 --> 00:33:04,743
'cause I'm the only guy who
made an offer and Lori maybe.

00:33:04,743 --> 00:33:06,214
We are
at the beginning.

00:33:06,214 --> 00:33:07,616
Right.

00:33:07,616 --> 00:33:10,656
It's not like you guys came here
with $10,000 of real orders.

00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:13,529
It's not like you came here
with a million-dollar company

00:33:13,529 --> 00:33:16,568
and I'm trying to
take advantage of you for 50%.

00:33:16,568 --> 00:33:17,670
It's a start-up.

00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:20,143
There's four of us.

00:33:20,143 --> 00:33:21,646
We each own 25%.

00:33:21,646 --> 00:33:24,485
That's my offer.
I don't know where Lori is.

00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,330
I like it.

00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:31,432
I'm in with you.

00:33:31,432 --> 00:33:34,105
Greg, there it is.
That's our offer.

00:33:34,105 --> 00:33:36,142
What do you say?

00:33:36,142 --> 00:33:38,514
So, what -- where are
your thoughts on the...

00:33:38,514 --> 00:33:40,819
I-I think that --
I think that we can work --

00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:42,489
with two sharks,
we got more.

00:33:42,489 --> 00:33:44,193
We've got double
the contacts.

00:33:44,193 --> 00:33:46,431
So, you're gonna be eaten alive
by these guys?

00:33:46,431 --> 00:33:48,468
I don't think
we're gonna be eaten alive.

00:33:48,468 --> 00:33:50,606
I think eventually,
we'll all eat together.

00:33:50,606 --> 00:33:51,842
You got an offer.
What are you gonna do?

00:33:51,842 --> 00:33:53,245
I agree.
We will accept the deal.

00:33:53,245 --> 00:33:54,247
HERJAVEC: Thank you.

00:33:54,247 --> 00:33:55,617
Lori, Robert,
let's do the deal.

00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:56,919
Awesome.
All right.

00:33:56,919 --> 00:33:58,021
Yeah,
nice job.

00:33:58,021 --> 00:33:59,258
Good dad.
Good dad.

00:33:59,258 --> 00:34:00,427
Good dad.

00:34:00,427 --> 00:34:02,631
We're gonna straighten out
lockers in America.

00:34:02,631 --> 00:34:03,767
Yeah,
thank you so much.

00:34:03,767 --> 00:34:05,170
Lori,
appreciate it.

00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:07,107
I think it's a huge problem,
and that's a great solution.

00:34:07,107 --> 00:34:08,477
HERJAVEC:
It's a great product.

00:34:08,477 --> 00:34:09,879
Thank you very much.
Thank you, guys.

00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:10,881
Good luck, guys.
Congratulations.

00:34:10,881 --> 00:34:12,118
Okay.
Congratulations.

00:34:12,118 --> 00:34:15,191
Well, it was a little bit more
than we wanted to give,

00:34:15,191 --> 00:34:17,262
but we got a deal
with two sharks!

00:34:17,262 --> 00:34:18,264
Boom!
Yay!

00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,266
Boom!

00:34:27,717 --> 00:34:30,222
NARRATOR: Next into the tank
is an entrepreneur

00:34:30,222 --> 00:34:32,059
with a way
to ease the difficulty

00:34:32,059 --> 00:34:33,329
of dining out with kids.

00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:41,011
Hello, sharks.
I'm Ben Alexander.

00:34:41,011 --> 00:34:43,049
I'm from sunny Tampa, Florida.

00:34:43,049 --> 00:34:50,064
And I'm asking you for $250,000
for 30% of my wild company.

00:34:50,064 --> 00:34:51,099
Whoo!

00:34:51,099 --> 00:34:52,436
Have you ever
gone to a restaurant

00:34:52,436 --> 00:34:53,604
and you order your food

00:34:53,604 --> 00:34:55,508
and there's nothing
the restaurant can do

00:34:55,508 --> 00:34:57,179
to make the food
come out faster?

00:34:57,179 --> 00:34:59,016
You might be impatient,

00:34:59,016 --> 00:35:01,053
but you know how it is
when you have kids.

00:35:01,053 --> 00:35:03,425
Oh, my gosh. They're swinging
from the chandeliers.

00:35:03,425 --> 00:35:05,196
They're running under the table,
over the table.

00:35:05,196 --> 00:35:06,298
It's crazy!

00:35:06,298 --> 00:35:09,270
Well, that's why restaurants
turn to me

00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:13,379
and my very unique,
very different,

00:35:13,379 --> 00:35:18,623
very unexpected company
that uses creativity...

00:35:18,623 --> 00:35:19,658
HERJAVEC: Oh, wow!

00:35:19,658 --> 00:35:20,727
...To put balloons
in restaurants!

00:35:20,727 --> 00:35:22,197
I am balloon distractions!

00:35:22,197 --> 00:35:23,768
[ all cheering ]
Happy day!

00:35:23,768 --> 00:35:27,175
Stop the madness!
[ laughter ]

00:35:27,175 --> 00:35:30,481
We are the nation's
premier talent agency

00:35:30,481 --> 00:35:33,187
for balloon artists
that we send

00:35:33,187 --> 00:35:35,158
into national
brand restaurants.

00:35:35,158 --> 00:35:38,565
We are the first company
to ever take this

00:35:38,565 --> 00:35:40,937
and put this
all over the United States.

00:35:40,937 --> 00:35:43,375
We made something special
for each of you.

00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:45,412
Oh, wow!
GREINER: [ chuckles ] Yay.

00:35:45,412 --> 00:35:47,116
Mr. Herjavec,
I know you love motorcycles.

00:35:47,116 --> 00:35:48,218
I do.

00:35:48,218 --> 00:35:50,423
So I made you
a very cool motorcycle.

00:35:50,423 --> 00:35:51,960
Oh.
Oh, how cute!

00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,329
Very cool!

00:35:53,329 --> 00:35:56,670
Lori, I know that -- I know
that you are the absolute,

00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,507
most awesome QVC shark.

00:35:58,507 --> 00:36:00,211
You look
so much better now.

00:36:00,211 --> 00:36:02,315
[ laughter ]
And -- and, Mr. Wonderful,

00:36:02,315 --> 00:36:04,652
I actually made you
a Chiquita banana...

00:36:04,652 --> 00:36:05,755
CORCORAN:
Oh, my God.

00:36:05,755 --> 00:36:06,791
...Fruit hat.

00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:08,895
Doesn't he look beautiful,
sharks?

00:36:08,895 --> 00:36:13,204
Now, Barbara, you are the queen
of building sales organizations.

00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:14,573
I've always wanted
to be a queen. Thank you.

00:36:14,573 --> 00:36:15,810
[ laughter ]
You are.

00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,647
And last but certainly
not least, Mr. Cuban...

00:36:17,647 --> 00:36:18,649
Thank you.

00:36:18,649 --> 00:36:19,818
...I'm a big fan
of the Mavericks,

00:36:19,818 --> 00:36:22,457
and I made you a Dallas Mavs...
I like it.

00:36:22,457 --> 00:36:23,993
...Basketball player.

00:36:23,993 --> 00:36:26,465
I would love
for you to join me.

00:36:26,465 --> 00:36:28,302
I will...
[ laughter ]

00:36:28,302 --> 00:36:30,741
[ laughs ]
I'm an emotional guy.

00:36:30,741 --> 00:36:33,112
Don't start crying yet!
Oh, my God.

00:36:33,112 --> 00:36:34,348
You haven't even
started asking me.

00:36:34,348 --> 00:36:35,384
Wait till
we say something.

00:36:35,384 --> 00:36:36,987
I would love
to have you guys come in

00:36:36,987 --> 00:36:38,590
and help me blow this up.

00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,993
[ sighs ]

00:36:39,993 --> 00:36:41,329
Thank you.
[ sighs ]

00:36:41,329 --> 00:36:42,532
[ laughter ]
whoo!

00:36:42,532 --> 00:36:43,534
Exhausting.

00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:44,603
Oh, my God.

00:36:44,603 --> 00:36:46,340
I-I need to ask
the most important question.

00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,044
Yes.
Are you like this all the time?

00:36:48,044 --> 00:36:49,646
I just wanted
to come out here

00:36:49,646 --> 00:36:52,452
and share the joy that I have
in my heart about this.

00:36:52,452 --> 00:36:55,058
I'm very worried you're going
to spontaneously combust.

00:36:55,058 --> 00:36:56,428
[ laughter ]
No kidding.

00:36:56,428 --> 00:36:58,799
Let's talk numbers,
or I'm taking out my penknife.

00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,436
Okay, fair enough.
[ laughs ]

00:37:00,436 --> 00:37:02,506
we do over $500,000 a year
in sales.

00:37:02,506 --> 00:37:03,543
Okay.

00:37:03,543 --> 00:37:05,012
I've done $4 million
since inception.

00:37:05,012 --> 00:37:06,282
Wow.

00:37:06,282 --> 00:37:08,286
What were your sales
last year, Ben?

00:37:08,286 --> 00:37:10,457
The sales
were actually a little higher.

00:37:10,457 --> 00:37:12,294
They were actually $650,000.

00:37:12,294 --> 00:37:13,296
GREINER:
Wow, big drop.

00:37:13,296 --> 00:37:14,465
So, why are sales
going down?

00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:16,503
I recruited a lot of magicians

00:37:16,503 --> 00:37:19,609
when the economy was really slow
and they were hurting.

00:37:19,609 --> 00:37:21,346
And then the economy got faster,

00:37:21,346 --> 00:37:23,150
and they started
getting more bookings.

00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,754
I couldn't find people
to run regions,

00:37:24,754 --> 00:37:25,922
and then what happened --

00:37:25,922 --> 00:37:28,428
I had the clown community
criticize me online.

00:37:28,428 --> 00:37:30,966
The clown community?
I'm not joking.

00:37:30,966 --> 00:37:32,436
Those nasty clowns!
[ laughter ]

00:37:32,436 --> 00:37:33,773
like, what --
what were they saying?

00:37:33,773 --> 00:37:35,475
Oh, just, like, "Your business
model, it's terrible."

00:37:35,475 --> 00:37:37,146
I'm the Sam Walton
of balloons.

00:37:37,146 --> 00:37:39,083
You don't want to piss off
the clown community!

00:37:39,083 --> 00:37:41,088
[ laughs ]
What business are you in?

00:37:41,088 --> 00:37:42,457
You haven't
really told us.

00:37:42,457 --> 00:37:44,027
Okay, restaurants pay us a fee

00:37:44,027 --> 00:37:47,000
to have a balloon artist come in
and do balloons after --

00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,137
distract the guests
on a regular basis.

00:37:49,137 --> 00:37:50,941
You're a booking agency.
Yes, we are.

00:37:50,941 --> 00:37:53,380
Okay,
so you book "talent."

00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,382
Mm-hmm.

00:37:54,382 --> 00:37:56,787
And they go out
to restaurants.

00:37:56,787 --> 00:37:58,925
Yes. Let me explain
so you understand.

00:37:58,925 --> 00:38:00,762
I really want
to build something

00:38:00,762 --> 00:38:02,399
so that I can find
regional partners.

00:38:02,399 --> 00:38:04,570
I've been putting out ads
and spending money,

00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:07,142
and I have regional partners
who get started and go to this

00:38:07,142 --> 00:38:08,578
and --
and don't pull the trigger.

00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:11,250
I say to the regional partner,
"I'm gonna give you a percentage

00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,255
"of the revenue
from the restaurants.

00:38:13,255 --> 00:38:14,591
"you have to train people.

00:38:14,591 --> 00:38:15,760
"they already know
the balloons

00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,063
'cause you have to know
the basics."

00:38:17,063 --> 00:38:18,232
As a matter of fact,

00:38:18,232 --> 00:38:19,434
I go out and do balloons
in restaurants myself.

00:38:19,434 --> 00:38:20,771
Oh, no, Ben, you got to focus.
You got to focus.

00:38:20,771 --> 00:38:22,140
Okay.
Tell us the structure.

00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:25,547
The regional partner sells
restaurants, trains people,

00:38:25,547 --> 00:38:26,883
and watches
the schedule weekly,

00:38:26,883 --> 00:38:28,520
so they're really
like a regional manager.

00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,390
And how much
do you charge the restaurant?

00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:32,161
I charge $40 to $60 a night.

00:38:32,161 --> 00:38:35,735
What does the balloon artist
charge the kids per balloon?

00:38:35,735 --> 00:38:38,140
Can I have her
answer this question?

00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,276
She's a real balloon artist.

00:38:39,276 --> 00:38:40,779
Sure, okay.
This is Josanna.

00:38:40,779 --> 00:38:43,017
What we do is,
we have a tip button

00:38:43,017 --> 00:38:44,420
that says we twist for tips,

00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,357
and what we do
as a "subtle hint" is,

00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:47,760
we stick a $5 bill in there.

00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,630
So, what are you gonna use
the money for?

00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,800
ALEXANDER: Okay.

00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,069
It doesn't really sound like
you need the cash.

00:38:52,069 --> 00:38:53,271
I want to franchise.

00:38:53,271 --> 00:38:55,510
I do, because I want
to franchise this idea.

00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,912
Oh, man,
you're gonna drive me crazy.

00:38:56,912 --> 00:38:58,282
HERJAVEC:
You don't need a franchise.

00:38:58,282 --> 00:39:00,720
You need
to build an infrastructure.

00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,591
You need people
to manage.

00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:05,330
I need a strategic partner who
can give me a little guidance.

00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:07,368
If you think
that franchising is a bad idea

00:39:07,368 --> 00:39:08,937
and you're an investor --
it's a real bad idea.

00:39:08,937 --> 00:39:10,441
I'm teachable, guys. If this
is a sales organization --

00:39:10,441 --> 00:39:12,578
but you're asking me
to give you $250,000,

00:39:12,578 --> 00:39:14,884
and you don't have a plan
for world domination

00:39:14,884 --> 00:39:15,919
of balloon twisters.

00:39:15,919 --> 00:39:17,021
If I don't franchise,

00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,558
I want to bring on
a full-time recruiter...

00:39:18,558 --> 00:39:19,627
Right.
...Who understands this.

00:39:19,627 --> 00:39:20,629
That's what I need.

00:39:20,629 --> 00:39:21,797
Ding, ding,
ding, ding!

00:39:21,797 --> 00:39:22,901
Operations and recruiting.

00:39:22,901 --> 00:39:24,303
I can sell
20 restaurants a day.

00:39:24,303 --> 00:39:26,307
You -- every region I visited
this summer, 17,000 --

00:39:26,307 --> 00:39:27,409
okay, Ben,
Ben, Ben --

00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:29,347
Ben, you -- you got to --
you know what?

00:39:29,347 --> 00:39:31,952
You're a great salesman,
but you didn't show me

00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:36,094
how I can give you $250,000
and get a great return.

00:39:37,698 --> 00:39:38,934
I'm out.

00:39:38,934 --> 00:39:40,437
Okay.
Miss Corcoran...

00:39:40,437 --> 00:39:41,506
CORCORAN: Yes?

00:39:41,506 --> 00:39:43,576
...You've built
sales organizations.

00:39:43,576 --> 00:39:44,980
You want to know
what this is?

00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,151
This is exactly like
building a real-estate business

00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:49,589
with multiple offices --
no different.

00:39:49,589 --> 00:39:50,591
Yeah.

00:39:50,591 --> 00:39:52,729
So I really understand
your business.

00:39:52,729 --> 00:39:53,831
I know you do.

00:39:53,831 --> 00:39:56,303
Your whole organization
is reliant

00:39:56,303 --> 00:39:59,142
on the right salesperson
in each region.

00:39:59,142 --> 00:40:00,813
That's the key
to this business.

00:40:00,813 --> 00:40:02,416
It's not
your ability to sell.

00:40:02,416 --> 00:40:04,988
It's your ability
to recruit salespeople.

00:40:04,988 --> 00:40:06,524
You've not succeeded
in doing that,

00:40:06,524 --> 00:40:07,861
and that's
an Achilles' heel.

00:40:07,861 --> 00:40:09,664
In your business,
that's gonna murder you.

00:40:09,664 --> 00:40:11,535
[ sighs ]
You're a phenomenal salesman.

00:40:11,535 --> 00:40:14,040
But you're not
a sales manager.

00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,514
I would be so scared putting
my money in your business.

00:40:17,514 --> 00:40:19,051
I'm sorry.
I'm out.

00:40:19,051 --> 00:40:22,257
GREINER: I'm gonna tell you
what I think.

00:40:22,257 --> 00:40:24,328
It is
an adorable idea,

00:40:24,328 --> 00:40:26,566
but I have sales reps
that work under me,

00:40:26,566 --> 00:40:28,470
and one
of the most important things is,

00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:30,541
is that they're very focused
and organized.

00:40:30,541 --> 00:40:32,713
And here,
I had so much trouble

00:40:32,713 --> 00:40:35,385
understanding the business plan
and model

00:40:35,385 --> 00:40:38,324
that I think it would be
very difficult for me

00:40:38,324 --> 00:40:40,529
to invest
and give you my money.

00:40:40,529 --> 00:40:41,664
I understand.

00:40:41,664 --> 00:40:43,401
So for that reason,
I'm out.

00:40:43,401 --> 00:40:45,205
Okay.

00:40:45,205 --> 00:40:47,911
Mr. Cuban?

00:40:47,911 --> 00:40:49,548
Your -- your business
is structured wrong,

00:40:49,548 --> 00:40:50,817
but that's
the bad news.

00:40:50,817 --> 00:40:53,189
The good news is,
if you get it together

00:40:53,189 --> 00:40:55,193
and you get your sales
up over a million dollars,

00:40:55,193 --> 00:40:57,130
this is an easily
sellable business...
yes.

00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:58,934
...Particularly someone who's
already got offices in place.

00:40:58,934 --> 00:41:00,737
We have fixed costs.
And you could sell it
for millions.

00:41:00,737 --> 00:41:02,241
If we can get this to one --
shut up!

00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,349
Whoa.

00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:08,120
My suggestion is,

00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,425
instead of
using regional managers

00:41:10,425 --> 00:41:13,264
and regional partners
on a commission basis,

00:41:13,264 --> 00:41:16,103
you go find the best
recent college graduate

00:41:16,103 --> 00:41:18,542
management talent
that you can find.

00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:20,044
Put them on a salary.
I got you.
Yeah, put them on a salary.

00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:21,147
It doesn't have to be
a lot.

00:41:21,147 --> 00:41:22,350
Give them some commission,
give them draw,

00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:23,752
whatever it may be.
okay.

00:41:23,752 --> 00:41:25,389
But develop
management talent.

00:41:25,389 --> 00:41:27,426
You're not ready
for me yet.

00:41:27,426 --> 00:41:30,634
I'd go crazy, and for
those two reasons, I'm out.

00:41:30,634 --> 00:41:34,341
O'LEARY:
I like your business,

00:41:34,341 --> 00:41:38,216
but you're missing the partner
that does the operations.

00:41:38,216 --> 00:41:40,521
Had they been here
sitting beside you --

00:41:40,521 --> 00:41:42,525
that ghost,
that clown, whatever it was --

00:41:42,525 --> 00:41:44,329
I would've probably
done your -- your deal.

00:41:44,329 --> 00:41:47,468
I like it
'cause it's so unique,

00:41:47,468 --> 00:41:49,573
and I know how to sell this
business in a couple of years.

00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:52,178
The riches are in the niches,
sharks, and you know what?

00:41:52,178 --> 00:41:53,381
We already have --
we already have --

00:41:53,381 --> 00:41:54,383
you got to listen!

00:41:54,383 --> 00:41:56,387
O'LEARY: But the point is,
you -- you --

00:41:56,387 --> 00:41:58,558
you can't get $250,000
from anybody in here,

00:41:58,558 --> 00:42:00,562
not the way you're structured
right now.

00:42:00,562 --> 00:42:02,968
Instead of leaving
with a heavy heart

00:42:02,968 --> 00:42:05,133
and a crying clown,
you should say,

00:42:05,133 --> 00:42:07,639
"I'm gonna take that advice
and run with it."

00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:10,067
But today, I'm out.

00:42:11,302 --> 00:42:13,304
Thank you very much, sharks.
CUBAN: Thank you.

00:42:13,304 --> 00:42:15,272
Thank you for the balloon.
GREINER:
Thank you for our hats.

00:42:18,309 --> 00:42:20,477
[ balloons popping ]
Oh, don't do that!

00:42:20,477 --> 00:42:22,446
Oh, you're so mean!
Don't pop 'em!

00:42:22,446 --> 00:42:23,681
Don't do that!
Kevin!

00:42:23,681 --> 00:42:25,082
[ laughs ]
Oh!
