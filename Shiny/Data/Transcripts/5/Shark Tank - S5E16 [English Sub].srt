00:00:02,072 --> 00:00:04,544
NARRATOR:
  Tonight on "Shark Tank,"
  New York Giants co-owner

00:00:04,544 --> 00:00:06,716
and prolific film producer
  Steve Tisch joins the tank,

00:00:06,716 --> 00:00:08,687
where things
  get even more heated...

00:00:08,687 --> 00:00:11,026
Let me finish
  talking, Mark.
  shut up, Kevin.

00:00:11,026 --> 00:00:12,796
...In one of the season's
  biggest bidding wars.

00:00:12,796 --> 00:00:14,835
You have three offers
  on the table.

00:00:14,835 --> 00:00:17,675
Hold on.
  I'm gonna offer $250,000.

00:00:17,675 --> 00:00:19,713
I will offer you $350,000.

00:00:19,713 --> 00:00:21,284
Are you done playing games
  with these guys?

00:00:21,284 --> 00:00:22,887
Do not give up
  your equity.

00:00:22,887 --> 00:00:25,761
I'm gonna offer you
  $1 million.
  whoa!

00:00:25,761 --> 00:00:27,798
NARRATOR: In the tank,
  hopeful entrepreneurs

00:00:27,798 --> 00:00:30,705
get a once-in-a-lifetime chance
  to pitch the sharks

00:00:30,705 --> 00:00:32,577
in hopes
  of getting an investment

00:00:32,577 --> 00:00:35,584
to start, grow,
  or save their businesses.

00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:37,655
The entrepreneurs
  must convince a shark

00:00:37,655 --> 00:00:40,194
to invest the full amount
  they're asking for,

00:00:40,194 --> 00:00:41,965
or they'll walk away
  with nothing.

00:00:41,965 --> 00:00:44,471
It's a hobby that should be
  taken behind the barn and shot.

00:00:44,471 --> 00:00:46,943
Do you realize how bad
  you just screwed up?
  what did I say?

00:00:46,943 --> 00:00:49,115
NARRATOR: If the sharks hear
  a great idea...

00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:51,420
Sales to date
  are $4.2 million.
  oh.

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,091
This is a megawatt hero.

00:00:53,091 --> 00:00:56,064
NARRATOR: ...They're ready to
  invest using their own money.

00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,401
It's a sweet deal.

00:00:57,401 --> 00:00:58,771
And they're willing
  to fight each other

00:00:58,771 --> 00:01:00,441
for a piece of the action.

00:01:00,441 --> 00:01:01,478
You know
  we're the right partners.

00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,115
So you just threw Steve
  under a bus.

00:01:03,115 --> 00:01:04,818
Yeah. Lori just
  kicked me to the curb.

00:01:04,818 --> 00:01:06,957
Yes!
  maybe she's not
  the right partner at all.

00:01:06,957 --> 00:01:08,260
Stop.
  we were just about to close.

00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,532
No, you weren't.
  JOHN: No, you weren't.

00:01:10,532 --> 00:01:12,169
Sit down, Lori.

00:01:12,169 --> 00:01:14,441
NARRATOR:
  who are the sharks?

00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:17,716
They're millionaire
  and billionaire investors

00:01:17,716 --> 00:01:20,021
who are entrepreneurs
  themselves.

00:01:21,425 --> 00:01:24,097
Kevin o'Leary
  is a venture capitalist

00:01:24,097 --> 00:01:26,536
who turned a $10,000 loan

00:01:26,536 --> 00:01:31,214
into a software business
  worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:31,214 --> 00:01:34,555
Mark Cuban -- notorious
  billionaire entrepreneur,

00:01:34,555 --> 00:01:35,925
tech guru,

00:01:35,925 --> 00:01:39,734
and the outspoken owner
  of the NBA's Dallas mavericks.

00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,247
Lori Greiner, the queen of QVC,
  holds over 100 patents

00:01:45,247 --> 00:01:46,984
and has launched
  over 300 products

00:01:46,984 --> 00:01:50,826
grossing over $500 million
  in retail sales.

00:01:50,826 --> 00:01:53,967
Daymond John is a fashion
  and branding expert

00:01:53,967 --> 00:01:56,172
who grew
  his homemade clothing line

00:01:56,172 --> 00:01:59,380
into the globally recognized
  fashion brand fubu,

00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,621
with over $6 billion
  in retail sales to date.

00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:06,730
And Steve Tisch.

00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,902
He is a renowned film producer,
  businessman,

00:02:08,902 --> 00:02:11,241
and co-owner
  of the New York Giants.

00:02:11,241 --> 00:02:13,245
He is also the only person with
  an Oscar and a Super Bowl ring.

00:02:27,546 --> 00:02:30,018
First into the tank
  is a couple with a product

00:02:30,018 --> 00:02:34,228
hoping to emulate the best part
  of a favorite breakfast food.

00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:39,173
[ laughs ]

00:02:41,713 --> 00:02:43,350
Hi.
  my name is Chris Pouy.

00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,120
And I am
  Tiffany Panhilason.

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,392
And our company is called
  Cow Wow cereal milk.

00:02:47,392 --> 00:02:49,965
And we're asking
  for $250,000

00:02:49,965 --> 00:02:52,304
in return for 10%
  of that company.

00:02:52,304 --> 00:02:54,709
You know after you have
  your favorite bowl of cereal

00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:57,115
and you drink the leftover milk
  and it tastes like...

00:02:57,115 --> 00:02:58,285
Heaven?
  heaven?

00:02:58,285 --> 00:03:00,155
That's cereal milk,

00:03:00,155 --> 00:03:02,495
and we've bottled it
  and made it good for you.

00:03:02,495 --> 00:03:07,439
So, how do we get kids
  to try Cow Wow?

00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,475
We tell them a story.

00:03:09,744 --> 00:03:12,050
Once upon a time,

00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,790
there was a dairy farm
  that ran out of hay.

00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,396
So the farmers ran
  straight to the cupboards

00:03:17,396 --> 00:03:21,305
and fed their cows the only
  thing they had left -- cereal.

00:03:21,305 --> 00:03:24,814
The next morning,
  when they milked their cows,

00:03:24,814 --> 00:03:26,351
the milk tasted sweet,

00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:29,023
just like the cereals
  they love to eat.

00:03:29,023 --> 00:03:30,995
The end.
  the end.

00:03:30,995 --> 00:03:33,133
Without any further ado,

00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:34,536
Tiffany's gonna
  hand out some samples,

00:03:34,536 --> 00:03:37,075
and I'm gonna get out
  of this ridiculous cow costume.

00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,684
Thank you, Tiffany.

00:03:40,684 --> 00:03:42,789
Thank you.
  thank you.

00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:45,228
All right, so, what Tiffany
  is handing out to you guys

00:03:45,228 --> 00:03:49,237
are fruity Trudy
  and chocolate chip Cathy.

00:03:49,237 --> 00:03:50,707
And that sugar label's
  actually wrong.

00:03:50,707 --> 00:03:52,912
We made a mistake in production.
  it's only 20 grams of sugar.

00:03:52,912 --> 00:03:56,789
14 grams of sugar are actually
  in a serving of milk.

00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:58,526
A lot of people
  don't know that.

00:03:58,526 --> 00:04:00,430
You're basically
  selling milk to kids that tastes

00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,668
like the leftover milk
  in the bottom of a cereal bowl.

00:04:02,668 --> 00:04:04,005
Yes, sir.

00:04:04,005 --> 00:04:06,143
What made you think
  of this?

00:04:06,143 --> 00:04:08,315
Like, are you
  major cereal lovers?

00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:09,785
Milk lovers? Like...?

00:04:09,785 --> 00:04:11,723
Yes and yes and yes.

00:04:11,723 --> 00:04:13,494
We were, like, in one of those
  yogurt places one night.

00:04:13,494 --> 00:04:15,532
And there were so many
  flavors. There was like
  20 flavors of yogurt.

00:04:15,532 --> 00:04:17,236
And then we were
  in the convenience store,

00:04:17,236 --> 00:04:19,241
and I look,
  and I'm just like, "wow.

00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:21,346
"why does milk
  only have three flavors --

00:04:21,346 --> 00:04:23,217
chocolate, vanilla,
  and strawberry?" like...

00:04:23,217 --> 00:04:25,088
The milk in the bottom
  of the bowl --

00:04:25,088 --> 00:04:26,558
is that something
  people like?

00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,295
I actually --
  I'm a cereal-for-dinner guy.

00:04:28,295 --> 00:04:32,071
I love the taste of cereal milk
  in the bottom of the bowl.

00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:33,407
Yeah, there's no question,
  right?

00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,713
Everybody loves -- like you
  said, everybody loves it.

00:04:35,713 --> 00:04:37,450
Yeah, I mean, it's the
  best part of the bowl.
  it's the best part
  of the bowl.

00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,255
I always looked at it like it
  had backwash and drool in it.

00:04:39,255 --> 00:04:40,658
Why would I want it?

00:04:40,658 --> 00:04:41,927
Have you tested this
  with kids?

00:04:41,927 --> 00:04:43,665
What kind of feedback
  have you gotten with kids?

00:04:43,665 --> 00:04:44,901
Absolutely.
  they love it.

00:04:44,901 --> 00:04:46,404
There's not a kid that has said
  that they didn't.

00:04:46,404 --> 00:04:48,276
Let me ask you something.
  I'm dairy-intolerant.

00:04:48,276 --> 00:04:49,846
So I didn't try it.
  but, Steve, you --

00:04:49,846 --> 00:04:51,383
how -- how did it taste?
  you didn't like it.

00:04:51,383 --> 00:04:54,758
Yeah, I mean, look, I'm gonna
  give you a "b" on the taste.

00:04:54,758 --> 00:04:58,833
It's not got enough
  cereal taste.

00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,537
It's not quite
  sweet enough.

00:05:00,537 --> 00:05:03,879
It doesn't remind me
  of my favorite cereals.

00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:06,184
Okay.
  what are your sales?

00:05:06,184 --> 00:05:09,960
It's $20,000.
  we just launched with one sku.

00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,931
Have you had any reorders
  on it?

00:05:11,931 --> 00:05:13,535
Yes, we've had reorders

00:05:13,535 --> 00:05:16,007
in all of our grocery stores
  that we were in.

00:05:16,007 --> 00:05:17,577
And how many are they?

00:05:17,577 --> 00:05:19,081
Right now
  it's eight Bristol farms,

00:05:19,081 --> 00:05:21,152
three test stores
  for albertsons,

00:05:21,152 --> 00:05:22,756
and we actually
  are one step away

00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:24,226
from getting
  a confirmed deal

00:05:24,226 --> 00:05:26,531
from one of the largest grocers
  in the country.

00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:27,935
And how big
  would that deal be?

00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,572
About $100,000.

00:05:29,572 --> 00:05:31,978
Which category are you trying
  to garner share in?

00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:33,849
Because this is not
  a refrigerated product.

00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:36,756
Flavored milk --
  $1.5-billion industry.

00:05:36,756 --> 00:05:38,627
It doesn't need
  to be refrigerated,

00:05:38,627 --> 00:05:39,929
but it tastes better
  when it's cold.

00:05:39,929 --> 00:05:41,033
Is it refrigerated
  or not?

00:05:41,033 --> 00:05:42,536
It is in albertsons
  and Bristol farms,

00:05:42,536 --> 00:05:44,006
but it doesn't
  need to be.
  that is a whole
  different story.

00:05:44,006 --> 00:05:46,645
Getting shelf space
  in refrigerated area

00:05:46,645 --> 00:05:48,750
is extremely expensive

00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,689
no matter
  how your cow suit looks.

00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:54,364
CUBAN: Now all of a sudden,
  you're competing with Borden,

00:05:54,364 --> 00:05:56,836
who has flavored milk and
  can easily come out with more.

00:05:56,836 --> 00:06:00,545
So you're competing with them
  and all their marketing dollars.

00:06:00,545 --> 00:06:03,986
And I think that's an uphill
  battle that is insurmountable.

00:06:03,986 --> 00:06:07,361
$250,000 isn't even gonna
  get you into the game

00:06:07,361 --> 00:06:08,630
to compete
  against those guys

00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,736
'cause you don't have
  a pure differentiation.

00:06:10,736 --> 00:06:12,206
So for that reason,
  I'm out.

00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,783
But, guys, you know,
  this one packet right here

00:06:16,783 --> 00:06:17,952
has 24 grams of sugar.

00:06:17,952 --> 00:06:20,325
20. That's wrong.
  it has 170 --

00:06:20,325 --> 00:06:22,162
20 or 24.
  170 calories
  is a lot...

00:06:22,162 --> 00:06:23,632
It's 170 calories.

00:06:23,632 --> 00:06:25,136
...For this
  little carton.
  it's a lot, yeah.

00:06:25,136 --> 00:06:26,639
To be selling this
  to kids.
  and a lot
  of sugar isn't...

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,109
I mean, there's an obesity issue
  we already have.

00:06:28,109 --> 00:06:29,546
That's a lot of calories
  for a kid.

00:06:29,546 --> 00:06:32,086
We have less sugar
  than any other flavored
  milk on the market.

00:06:32,086 --> 00:06:36,429
It's less sugar than any juice
  or any soda.

00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:39,035
When they made a petition
  to take flavored milk
  out of schools,

00:06:39,035 --> 00:06:40,806
there was an incredible backlash
  from the kids.

00:06:40,806 --> 00:06:42,075
You know,
  there was one kid in Ohio

00:06:42,075 --> 00:06:43,446
that wrote like
  a five-paragraph essay

00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:45,249
about how they wanted
  to get milk back in the school.

00:06:45,249 --> 00:06:47,121
Do you realize how bad
  you just screwed up?

00:06:47,121 --> 00:06:50,028
What did I say?
  look, you just
  came in here.

00:06:50,028 --> 00:06:51,665
We probably
  never would have known

00:06:51,665 --> 00:06:54,672
that they tried to take
  flavored milk out of any school.

00:06:54,672 --> 00:06:56,977
And you just told us
  one of the biggest red flags

00:06:56,977 --> 00:06:58,849
that we probably
  could have uncovered.

00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:00,786
Well, the reason
  I want to tell you is because

00:07:00,786 --> 00:07:02,657
when they took flavored milk
  out of schools,

00:07:02,657 --> 00:07:04,996
the kids started drinking
  soda and juice.

00:07:04,996 --> 00:07:06,433
And they demanded,

00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:08,170
"please, give us back
  our -- our chocolate milk,"

00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,874
because they loved it,
  it's more nutritious.

00:07:09,874 --> 00:07:12,247
It has nine essential vitamins
  and nutrients.

00:07:12,247 --> 00:07:15,320
The ratio of carbs to protein --
  flavored milk is being marketed

00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,459
as the perfect recovery drink
  for athletes.

00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:18,794
Say that again.

00:07:18,794 --> 00:07:20,198
What?!

00:07:20,198 --> 00:07:22,103
Chocolate milk -- "got milk?"
  did a $25-million campaign

00:07:22,103 --> 00:07:23,406
marketing chocolate milk
  to athletes

00:07:23,406 --> 00:07:24,642
because the ratio of carbs
  to protein

00:07:24,642 --> 00:07:25,912
is actually better
  than most --

00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,482
not in my locker room.
  is it in your locker room?

00:07:27,482 --> 00:07:29,587
[ laughs ] No.
  but this product is not
  positioned to athletes.

00:07:29,587 --> 00:07:31,090
This is for children.
  POUY: Well, I'm just saying
  pediatricians and health --

00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,928
so people are gonna start
  dumping yoo-hoo on people

00:07:32,928 --> 00:07:34,197
after they win
  the championship?

00:07:34,197 --> 00:07:35,434
[ laughter ]

00:07:35,434 --> 00:07:38,608
I think it's dangerous
  to give kids this product.

00:07:38,608 --> 00:07:41,848
I-i don't see any value in it
  for me. I'm out.

00:07:43,887 --> 00:07:45,692
POUY: We're not trying
  to get kids

00:07:45,692 --> 00:07:47,529
to drink something
  that's unhealthy.

00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:49,232
There's no ceragenin.
  there's no artificial flavors.

00:07:49,232 --> 00:07:51,104
There's no
  artificial sweeteners.

00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:53,309
We have the cleanest label
  in flavored milk.

00:07:53,309 --> 00:07:56,951
You guys,
  I don't even like milk.

00:07:56,951 --> 00:07:59,757
So, I have to love
  and feel passionate

00:07:59,757 --> 00:08:01,762
about any deal that I do.

00:08:01,762 --> 00:08:03,332
So I'm out.

00:08:04,836 --> 00:08:06,974
Chris,
  I love the concept.

00:08:06,974 --> 00:08:10,416
I love cereal milk.
  I love the branding.

00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:15,160
As I said earlier, it's not
  quite there in terms of taste.

00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,733
It's a "b."
  I need it to be an "a."

00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:20,039
I don't think your product
  is there yet.

00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:21,976
I'm out.

00:08:24,214 --> 00:08:26,554
In the end,
  what happens?

00:08:26,554 --> 00:08:29,995
All cows come back
  to the pasture right here.

00:08:29,995 --> 00:08:31,131
Right.
  all right?

00:08:31,131 --> 00:08:32,635
So you're saying you want
  your udder pulled?

00:08:32,635 --> 00:08:35,340
No, no, I'm basically saying --
  I'm basically saying

00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,980
it's a very old
  and established space --

00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,386
a $1.5-billion
  flavored-milk market.

00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:44,028
I would think to get a valuation
  here of $2.5 million,

00:08:44,028 --> 00:08:46,467
you would need a much more
  concise business plan

00:08:46,467 --> 00:08:48,906
that can explain
  to any one of us

00:08:48,906 --> 00:08:50,910
why you have a hope in hell
  of getting share.

00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,749
'cause I think right now

00:08:52,749 --> 00:08:55,321
we're going to get crushed
  like an udder.

00:08:57,426 --> 00:08:59,698
I'm very out.

00:08:59,698 --> 00:09:00,968
Thank you, guys.
  appreciate it.
  thank you.

00:09:00,968 --> 00:09:03,073
GREINER: Good luck.

00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,115
PANHILASON: I think the sharks
  gave great advice.

00:09:07,115 --> 00:09:08,953
I mean, they are successful
  for a reason.

00:09:08,953 --> 00:09:11,225
POUY: But I think maybe
  they're just a little too old

00:09:11,225 --> 00:09:12,729
and they just don't get it.

00:09:12,729 --> 00:09:14,766
It doesn't mean that
  we're gonna stop from here.
  yeah.

00:09:14,766 --> 00:09:16,638
We're just gonna take
  their advice and make our...

00:09:16,638 --> 00:09:17,773
Keep on moo-ving.

00:09:17,773 --> 00:09:19,310
Yes. [ chuckles ]
  make our brand better.

00:09:29,668 --> 00:09:31,339
[ bicycle bell rings,
  child laughs ]

00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:33,410
I'm Joan.
  and I'm Julia.

00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:36,083
BOTH: And we're sisters
  from Normal, Illinois.

00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:39,057
Growing up in a family of seven,
  everything was homemade.

00:09:39,057 --> 00:09:40,794
Baking is practically
  in our blood.

00:09:40,794 --> 00:09:43,567
We've been baking since we've
  been little girls with our mom

00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:45,304
in the kitchen
  and haven't stopped.

00:09:45,304 --> 00:09:46,876
Let's go eat.

00:09:46,876 --> 00:09:49,181
We've developed
  the perfect alternative

00:09:49,181 --> 00:09:51,753
to one of America's
  guiltiest pleasures.

00:09:51,753 --> 00:09:53,758
It's gourmet,
  it's delicious,

00:09:53,758 --> 00:09:55,161
and there's nothing like it
  on the market.

00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,665
[ both laugh ]

00:09:56,665 --> 00:09:59,037
Working together as sisters
  is fun.

00:09:59,037 --> 00:10:00,707
I'm the boss.
  no, you're not.
  yeah, I am.

00:10:00,707 --> 00:10:02,311
Neither of us are the boss.
  we're partners.

00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:05,184
We are partners, but most
  of the time, I am the boss.

00:10:05,184 --> 00:10:06,521
Okay. A little room.

00:10:06,521 --> 00:10:09,862
Our facility is
  the world's tiniest kitchen.

00:10:09,862 --> 00:10:12,201
Getting an investment
  would put us into a place

00:10:12,201 --> 00:10:14,640
where we can actually have
  a production.

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,614
Americans are gonna love our
  product because it's unique

00:10:17,614 --> 00:10:20,253
and it's a sweet treat
  that everyone can enjoy.

00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:22,358
We want to be
  in mass production,

00:10:22,358 --> 00:10:23,996
and we want to become
  a national brand,

00:10:23,996 --> 00:10:25,733
and we need the sharks
  to help us do that.

00:10:42,973 --> 00:10:44,543
Hi. I'm Joan Pacetti.

00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:47,050
And I'm Julia Schmid.
  and we're sisters.

00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,452
And together
  we own...

00:10:48,452 --> 00:10:50,224
BOTH:
  ...The Cookie Dough Cafe.

00:10:50,224 --> 00:10:55,168
We are seeking $50,000
  for 20% of our company.

00:10:55,168 --> 00:10:58,676
Anyone who has ever baked
  homemade cookies

00:10:58,676 --> 00:11:00,548
knows how tempting
  the cookie dough can be.

00:11:00,548 --> 00:11:04,257
It's gooey. It's sweet.
  it's sinful.

00:11:04,257 --> 00:11:07,197
But we all know we should not be
  sneaking bites of cookie dough.

00:11:07,197 --> 00:11:10,003
We've heard about raw eggs
  and salmonella,

00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,643
and every pre-packaged
  cookie dough has labels

00:11:12,643 --> 00:11:15,416
saying, "warning --
  do not eat raw."

00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:18,122
even though we know this,
  we still swipe by the spoonful.

00:11:18,122 --> 00:11:21,096
That's why we created
  a safe, edible cookie dough

00:11:21,096 --> 00:11:25,206
that is strictly made for
  eating, indulging, and enjoying.

00:11:25,206 --> 00:11:26,374
Yes!

00:11:26,374 --> 00:11:28,179
Don't bother
  preheating your oven.

00:11:28,179 --> 00:11:31,120
You can enjoy our product
  straight from the jar.

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,625
SCHMID:
  this is the real deal.

00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,262
This is your mama's
  cookie dough.

00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:36,565
It's creamy,

00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:37,902
loaded full
  of chocolate chips,

00:11:37,902 --> 00:11:41,811
delicious candies, real butter,
  and no added preservatives.

00:11:41,811 --> 00:11:45,319
We have the only gourmet, edible
  cookie dough on the market

00:11:45,319 --> 00:11:48,493
specifically made
  to consume as is.

00:11:48,493 --> 00:11:51,433
We have hand-packed thousands
  of pints of cookie dough

00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:53,672
in the world's
  tiniest kitchen.

00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:55,009
We need your help.

00:11:55,009 --> 00:11:57,782
So grab a spoon
  and dig right in.

00:11:57,782 --> 00:11:59,553
Yes!
  hey! [ laughs ]

00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:01,791
you get the Oreo,
  Steve.

00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:04,464
And Lori gets
  the chocolate chip.

00:12:04,464 --> 00:12:07,204
Whoa!

00:12:10,946 --> 00:12:14,187
Now, what is stopping salmonella
  from growing in this?

00:12:14,187 --> 00:12:16,058
It contains no eggs
  whatsoever.

00:12:16,058 --> 00:12:18,029
Hmm.

00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:19,866
GREINER:
  oh, this is great.
  thank you.
  thank you.

00:12:19,866 --> 00:12:23,375
This tastes so good.
  what does this pint sell for?

00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:27,284
$6.99 is what
  it retails for.

00:12:27,284 --> 00:12:29,356
And what do you
  make it for?
  $2.20.

00:12:29,356 --> 00:12:31,962
Can you also bake cookies
  with this, or no?

00:12:31,962 --> 00:12:33,633
BOTH: You can.

00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:35,671
But they'll just be
  really flat because
  there's no baking soda.

00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:38,811
And they don't taste as good
  baked without the eggs.

00:12:38,811 --> 00:12:41,050
And you've been in business
  how long?

00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:42,387
A little over a year.

00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:43,689
How are the sales?

00:12:43,689 --> 00:12:46,562
Our sales to date
  are $24,000.

00:12:46,562 --> 00:12:48,234
What were your sales
  last month?

00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:51,140
Last month, they were
  probably $1,600.

00:12:52,643 --> 00:12:55,785
1,600 units or $1,600?

00:12:55,785 --> 00:12:57,188
Dollars.

00:12:57,188 --> 00:12:59,493
Yes.

00:12:59,493 --> 00:13:00,963
$1,600?
  we were
  in seven stores.

00:13:00,963 --> 00:13:02,600
Seven stores.
  we just --

00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,706
we got a purchase order
  last week

00:13:04,706 --> 00:13:06,844
for more than what
  we've sold all year.

00:13:06,844 --> 00:13:08,881
It's gonna put us
  in an additional

00:13:08,881 --> 00:13:10,753
50 fresh market
  grocery stores.

00:13:10,753 --> 00:13:13,827
Your purchase order was for how
  much money and how many units?

00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:16,900
2,300 pints. And we'll make
  about $6,000 on it.

00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,106
GREINER: What's your mode
  of selling?

00:13:19,106 --> 00:13:21,712
How are you trying to get
  your product out there?

00:13:21,712 --> 00:13:25,855
We don't do any marketing
  or anything like that. Um --

00:13:25,855 --> 00:13:28,060
how are you getting into
  the grocery stores, though?

00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,563
'cause that's very hard.
  we approached
  the fresh market.

00:13:29,563 --> 00:13:32,470
Yeah, we went and talked to
  the manager in normal, Illinois.

00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,842
He looked at our packaging.
  he tasted our product.

00:13:34,842 --> 00:13:37,382
And he was like,
  "this is gonna be huge."

00:13:37,382 --> 00:13:39,754
and how much has he sold --
  has that one store sold?

00:13:39,754 --> 00:13:41,691
$11,000 of our sales
  last year.

00:13:41,691 --> 00:13:43,363
Over a year?
  in just one store.

00:13:43,363 --> 00:13:44,866
Do you really think,
  in one store,

00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:47,740
a product that only does $11,000
  can stay on the shelf?

00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,412
It's $900 a month.

00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:51,682
Who cares?

00:13:53,687 --> 00:13:54,789
Now, stop it.

00:13:54,789 --> 00:13:57,295
But, I mean,
  think about it.

00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,568
If you could get
  that year back

00:13:59,568 --> 00:14:02,474
and you never had
  this nightmare, would you --

00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:04,245
shut up, Kevin.
  Kevin!

00:14:04,245 --> 00:14:05,682
Are you kidding?

00:14:05,682 --> 00:14:06,717
How much
  have you invested?

00:14:06,717 --> 00:14:08,789
$35,000 total.
  total.

00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:11,261
What are you gonna do
  with the $50,000?

00:14:11,261 --> 00:14:14,536
Purchase equipment that'll help
  automate the packing process

00:14:14,536 --> 00:14:16,106
'cause that's the most
  time-consuming part

00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:17,275
of our job
  right now.

00:14:17,275 --> 00:14:19,580
What are you guys doing now
  to make a living?

00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,817
Is this all you're doing?

00:14:20,817 --> 00:14:23,322
I'm an agent at
  an R.V. Dealership.
  okay.

00:14:23,322 --> 00:14:24,759
And I'm
  a stay-at-home mom.

00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:27,266
We come from a family
  of entrepreneurs.

00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,571
Our dad literally swept
  the floor in a factory

00:14:29,571 --> 00:14:31,174
and started
  his own business.

00:14:31,174 --> 00:14:33,246
Unfortunately,
  he's passed away,

00:14:33,246 --> 00:14:35,552
but one of our older brothers
  took over the business,

00:14:35,552 --> 00:14:37,523
and it's a multimillion-dollar
  business now.

00:14:37,523 --> 00:14:40,497
How come your brother hasn't
  helped you with the $50,000?

00:14:40,497 --> 00:14:42,568
We haven't asked.

00:14:42,568 --> 00:14:44,506
Why?
  I don't know.

00:14:44,506 --> 00:14:46,744
Sense of pride? I mean...
  [ chuckles ] yeah.

00:14:46,744 --> 00:14:48,181
I get that.

00:14:48,181 --> 00:14:50,085
We're here, obviously,
  for the $50,000,

00:14:50,085 --> 00:14:51,823
but we also need
  some connections,

00:14:51,823 --> 00:14:55,197
like getting our product
  in a manufacturing facility.

00:14:55,197 --> 00:14:56,969
We don't know
  how to do that.

00:14:56,969 --> 00:14:59,441
JOHN: That leads me
  to my next statement.

00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:01,279
I love it.

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,021
If you do this deal,
  I'm gonna add egg to yours.

00:15:07,693 --> 00:15:11,102
But it's so early
  at this point.

00:15:11,102 --> 00:15:12,672
I would have to do
  way more work.

00:15:12,672 --> 00:15:14,877
I would have to ask you
  for so much of the company

00:15:14,877 --> 00:15:16,046
that it would be unfair.

00:15:16,046 --> 00:15:19,154
I wouldn't have the time
  to help you.

00:15:19,154 --> 00:15:21,426
I'm a customer
  but not an investor.

00:15:21,426 --> 00:15:22,495
I'm out.

00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:31,115
I like what you guys are doing.
  it tastes great.

00:15:31,115 --> 00:15:32,986
But to Daymond's point,

00:15:32,986 --> 00:15:35,926
you're still in that early,
  early, early stage,

00:15:35,926 --> 00:15:37,798
and you're gonna
  be turning to us

00:15:37,798 --> 00:15:40,070
because you don't want to
  have to go through this blindly.

00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,408
That's the whole point
  of coming here, right?

00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,547
And so that creates
  a lot of work for us.

00:15:44,547 --> 00:15:46,284
But don't you think
  that's good, too?

00:15:46,284 --> 00:15:48,021
We don't have
  $1 million in sales

00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:50,327
and we're not in here
  asking you for $500,000?

00:15:50,327 --> 00:15:53,367
Can't you see this
  in stadiums...
  oh, absolutely.

00:15:53,367 --> 00:15:55,105
...And theaters and
  single cookie-dough cups?

00:15:55,105 --> 00:15:56,341
Yeah, in some respects,
  you're right.

00:15:56,341 --> 00:15:58,045
But it's too early.

00:15:58,045 --> 00:16:00,650
And so for that reason,
  I'm out.

00:16:04,326 --> 00:16:08,336
O'LEARY: My big problem with
  this is the proof of concept.

00:16:08,336 --> 00:16:09,839
You've practically
  sold nothing.

00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:13,815
I don't think this is
  going to be a big product.

00:16:13,815 --> 00:16:14,985
I really don't.

00:16:14,985 --> 00:16:17,624
When we just got
  50 additional stores?

00:16:17,624 --> 00:16:19,161
You would give up
  when you just went

00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:21,199
from 7 stores to 50
  in a week?

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,571
I mean, look, I don't want
  to insult you --

00:16:23,571 --> 00:16:25,074
Kevin sees the word "dough,"
  and he gets confused.

00:16:26,077 --> 00:16:30,320
I don't want you to pursue
  the path to hell on Earth.

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,358
It's a hobby that eventually

00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,062
should be taken behind the barn
  and shot.

00:16:34,062 --> 00:16:36,836
I hate it.

00:16:36,836 --> 00:16:37,939
I'm out.

00:16:49,699 --> 00:16:51,570
NARRATOR:
  three sharks are out.

00:16:52,807 --> 00:16:57,484
Julia and Joan have only two
  chances left to make a deal.

00:16:57,484 --> 00:17:00,658
We've had people approach us,
  and we can't get

00:17:00,658 --> 00:17:03,365
to that next step because
  we weren't with a distributor.

00:17:03,365 --> 00:17:05,904
We've had Walgreens
  call us up.

00:17:05,904 --> 00:17:09,178
We had everything finalized
  to be in their flagship stores

00:17:09,178 --> 00:17:11,550
like you have in Hollywood,
  downtown Chicago.

00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,254
How did you
  get into Walgreens?

00:17:13,254 --> 00:17:14,256
They
  approached us.

00:17:14,256 --> 00:17:15,526
They saw
  our product...
  where?

00:17:15,526 --> 00:17:18,099
...On the fresh market shelf
  and called us up.

00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:21,240
Because we weren't with
  a distributor they used --

00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,578
you know,
  we're not big enough yet,

00:17:23,578 --> 00:17:25,182
they said,
  "call us when you get in."

00:17:25,182 --> 00:17:26,719
so that door is still open,
  you think?

00:17:26,719 --> 00:17:29,159
Oh, yeah.
  it's still -- I talked
  to her two weeks ago.

00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:32,934
You know, I remember what
  it was like to be just like you.

00:17:32,934 --> 00:17:37,243
I don't agree with Mark.
  I don't mind doing hard work.

00:17:37,243 --> 00:17:38,881
And you don't mind
  doing hard work.
  no, I don't.

00:17:38,881 --> 00:17:41,019
So I think
  we'll put our heads together,

00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:43,525
do a lot of hard work,
  and get it out there everywhere.

00:17:43,525 --> 00:17:45,864
But I also was sitting here
  thinking, when you said,

00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,267
"it would be good in stadiums."

00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:51,176
I've got a guy next to me.
  he's got some stadiums, himself.

00:17:51,176 --> 00:17:53,916
I think it's a great product
  for stadiums.

00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:56,757
I've also got great contacts
  in hotels.

00:17:56,757 --> 00:17:59,663
I think this in a hotel room --
  slam dunk.

00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:02,036
Would you want
  to partner with me?

00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:08,016
Go 50/50?

00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:13,963
Yes, and you get two sharks
  with different contacts,

00:18:13,963 --> 00:18:15,567
different connections,
  different opportunities.

00:18:15,567 --> 00:18:16,770
We like that.

00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,874
We like that. Yeah.
  GREINER: It's a lot.

00:18:18,874 --> 00:18:23,920
How about we give you $100,000
  for a 30% stake?

00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,428
I think we should offer $100,000
  for 40%.

00:18:27,428 --> 00:18:29,467
Okay.

00:18:30,268 --> 00:18:33,342
And we see this also paired
  with a large ice cream --

00:18:33,342 --> 00:18:34,712
guys, guys!
  that is a sweet deal.

00:18:34,712 --> 00:18:35,814
What are you gonna do?
  did you hear
  what they said?

00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:38,287
It's a lot of dough
  for your dough.

00:18:40,024 --> 00:18:42,296
I would rather do
  the $50,000.

00:18:42,296 --> 00:18:45,170
I would rather do $50,000
  for 20%.

00:18:50,616 --> 00:18:56,196
We don't want to give up much
  more than 20% of our company.

00:18:56,196 --> 00:18:58,968
Joan, I'm gonna give you
  some rolling papers so
  you can smoke this stuff.

00:18:58,968 --> 00:19:00,272
[ laughs ]

00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:01,675
You should take that offer.
  are you out of your mind?

00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:02,878
40% of our company?

00:19:02,878 --> 00:19:04,114
Oh, my God.

00:19:12,801 --> 00:19:14,572
GREINER: How about this?

00:19:14,572 --> 00:19:19,283
We'll go back
  to $100,000 at 30%.

00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,287
Steve,
  are you okay with that?

00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:29,506
I'm okay with that.

00:19:29,506 --> 00:19:31,612
Girls,
  do you accept our offer?

00:19:33,683 --> 00:19:35,153
We'll do it.
  yes.

00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:36,423
Done?
  it's a deal.

00:19:36,423 --> 00:19:37,492
Yes, it's done.
  TISCH:
  thank you, ladies.

00:19:37,492 --> 00:19:38,361
Yay!
  GREINER: Yay!

00:19:38,361 --> 00:19:39,631
Good job, girls.
  ladies.

00:19:39,631 --> 00:19:40,800
Thank you!
  thank you!

00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,103
Thank you so much.

00:19:42,103 --> 00:19:43,841
TISCH: Thanks, guys.

00:19:45,578 --> 00:19:49,086
[ both laugh ]

00:19:49,086 --> 00:19:51,825
Yeah, the rookie
  closes his first deal.
  congratulations, rook.

00:19:51,825 --> 00:19:53,530
[ laughs ]

00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,835
We are so excited and happy
  we got a deal.

00:19:55,835 --> 00:19:58,609
We feel like it'll build
  our brand 10 times faster

00:19:58,609 --> 00:20:00,112
than we could have done
  on our own.

00:20:00,112 --> 00:20:01,783
Yeah.
  100 times faster. Yeah.
  yeah.

00:20:06,795 --> 00:20:09,167
NARRATOR:
  Last season, Tania Patruno,

00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:13,176
along with company spokesman
  NFL running back Brandon Jacobs,

00:20:13,176 --> 00:20:14,879
struck a deal with Daymond John

00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:17,486
for their protein-infused water
  PRO-NRG.

00:20:17,486 --> 00:20:20,861
I'm gonna give you
  $250,000 for 30%,

00:20:20,861 --> 00:20:24,535
contingent on me taking it to a
  protein and supplement company.

00:20:24,535 --> 00:20:26,207
That's a yes, Daymond.
  that's a yes.
  all right.

00:20:26,207 --> 00:20:28,177
Let's see
  how they're doing now.

00:20:28,177 --> 00:20:32,254
Before "Shark Tank,"
  we had $165,000 in sales.

00:20:32,254 --> 00:20:33,858
Since airing a year ago,

00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:37,533
we have $1.5 million in sales
  and growing.

00:20:39,003 --> 00:20:40,607
We now have
  a fulfillment warehouse.

00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:43,180
We've completely reformulated
  and repackaged our product,

00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,117
and we have created
  over 30 new jobs.

00:20:45,117 --> 00:20:46,955
After making my deal
  with Daymond,

00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:49,327
he introduced us to Kevin
  from rightway nutrition,

00:20:49,327 --> 00:20:52,033
who is a big player
  in beverage manufacturing.

00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:53,838
And he helped me
  launch my product

00:20:53,838 --> 00:20:55,108
into the mainstream market.

00:20:55,108 --> 00:20:58,715
We are now on sale
  at every Walgreens nationwide.

00:20:58,715 --> 00:20:59,885
Over the next year,

00:20:59,885 --> 00:21:03,059
we're projecting
  over $3 million in sales.

00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:08,271
Brandon Jacobs has been
  instrumental to our company.

00:21:08,271 --> 00:21:10,744
He's constantly pushing
  our product to his friends,

00:21:10,744 --> 00:21:13,517
his teammates, his fans --
  anybody who will listen.

00:21:13,517 --> 00:21:14,820
Yo, Brandon, what's up?

00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,092
We're on the field here today
  because we're gonna talk

00:21:17,092 --> 00:21:19,397
to Brandon Jacobs about
  our new national campaign.

00:21:19,397 --> 00:21:22,104
We need to make people aware
  that it's not only for athletes.

00:21:22,104 --> 00:21:23,173
It's for everyday moms
  and kids.

00:21:23,173 --> 00:21:24,777
And with the new
  developed flavors

00:21:24,777 --> 00:21:27,183
and the way that they're
  improved, kids actually like it.

00:21:27,183 --> 00:21:28,452
This thing is bigger
  than we thought.

00:21:28,452 --> 00:21:29,922
Man, you've been a great
  partner. Let's keep rocking.

00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:32,462
Now why don't you show me some
  football? Show us some moves.

00:21:32,462 --> 00:21:34,934
PATRUNO: "Shark Tank" instantly
  put us in the spotlight

00:21:34,934 --> 00:21:36,604
and has given us every tool
  to succeed.

00:21:36,604 --> 00:21:38,609
I'm so thankful
  for this experience

00:21:38,609 --> 00:21:40,614
because it has completely
  changed my life.

00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:09,281
My name is Terry Jones,
  and I'm the C.E.O. Of Nexersys.

00:22:09,281 --> 00:22:11,654

or if you're
  an Olympic medalist,

00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:33,772
like my friend marlen esparza.

00:22:33,772 --> 00:22:36,712
Nexersys combines the benefits
  of a personal trainer

00:22:36,712 --> 00:22:40,454
with the fun and excitement
  of today's online games.

00:22:40,454 --> 00:22:42,359
You simply select
  your personal profile,

00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:44,731
then you choose
  between circuit training,

00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:46,869
high-intensity interval rounds,

00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:48,473
or a one-on-one challenge

00:22:48,473 --> 00:22:50,812
against one
  of our Nexersys avatars.

00:22:50,812 --> 00:22:52,282

  oh!

00:23:50,752 --> 00:23:51,855
[ bell dings ]
  look at that.

00:23:51,855 --> 00:23:53,893
Great work! Yeah!
  awesome, Mark!

00:23:53,893 --> 00:23:55,029
Way to go, Mark!

00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:58,070
But you can see
  Mark was 36% accurate.

00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,709
He was hitting real hard, but
  not necessarily real accurate.

00:24:00,709 --> 00:24:02,413
I just wanted
  to knock his ass out.

00:24:02,413 --> 00:24:04,284
Great job. I believe
  he knocked him out.

00:24:04,284 --> 00:24:05,487
I didn't feel a thing.

00:24:06,489 --> 00:24:08,828
Mark, was it fun?

00:24:08,828 --> 00:24:11,635
It was a nice little workout.
  how long did we do?

00:24:11,635 --> 00:24:13,272
You did 15 seconds.

00:24:13,272 --> 00:24:14,975
I mean, doing three minutes on
  that would be a great workout.

00:24:14,975 --> 00:24:17,548
O'LEARY: Eventually,
  we got to get to this.

00:24:17,548 --> 00:24:20,054
You put a huge valuation
  on this company -- $20 million.

00:24:20,054 --> 00:24:21,692
Do you have any sales?

00:24:21,692 --> 00:24:23,296
Uh, we do. We are --

00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,366
sales to date
  are a little over $4 million.

00:24:25,366 --> 00:24:26,670
Wow.

00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,006
$4.2 million.

00:24:28,006 --> 00:24:29,743
That's over about 18 months.

00:24:29,743 --> 00:24:31,682
Do you make any money?

00:24:31,682 --> 00:24:33,218
We are not profitable yet.

00:24:33,218 --> 00:24:35,557
We should be profitable
  in September of this year.

00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:38,764
And is this designed
  for gyms and the home?

00:24:38,764 --> 00:24:41,171
Absolutely. The black model
  is the personal model.

00:24:41,171 --> 00:24:43,041
The silver model
  is the commercial model.

00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:44,913
Where are the sales?
  give me the breakdown.

00:24:44,913 --> 00:24:48,420
Currently, about 70% commercial
  and about 30% home.

00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,962
I think it's very cool.
  I do really like it.

00:24:51,962 --> 00:24:54,001
Well, you get demonstration,
  I think, better

00:24:54,001 --> 00:24:56,072
than almost anyone in the world
  having your experience on QVC.

00:24:56,072 --> 00:24:59,313
While you're groveling
  up to Lori, let's go
  back to the numbers.

00:24:59,313 --> 00:25:01,785
What's your cost to make
  one of those units?

00:25:01,785 --> 00:25:04,759
Uh, just under $2,000
  for the commercial unit.

00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:07,432
Now, Terry, this is really
  a digital punching bag.

00:25:07,432 --> 00:25:10,039
A punching bag costs
  about $1,200 --

00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:11,474
a good one, leather,
  et cetera.

00:25:11,474 --> 00:25:12,544
What does that cost?

00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:14,916
Uh, the commercial unit
  is $7,000.

00:25:14,916 --> 00:25:16,988
Whoa!

00:25:16,988 --> 00:25:18,224
And it is --
  no, that's cheaper...

00:25:18,224 --> 00:25:20,730
So I can buy a car
  or buy this.

00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:21,966
[ laughs ]

00:25:21,966 --> 00:25:25,107
Or you can buy a --
  buy a treadmill

00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:26,744
or an elliptical
  in the same price range.

00:25:26,744 --> 00:25:29,283
What about the home unit?
  how much is that, Terry?

00:25:29,283 --> 00:25:30,921
Uh, $2,995.

00:25:30,921 --> 00:25:32,858
JOHN:
  how do you sell them?

00:25:32,858 --> 00:25:34,128
We sell --
  we promote it on TV

00:25:34,128 --> 00:25:35,765
with direct-to-consumer
  advertising.

00:25:35,765 --> 00:25:36,901
We sell it electronically.

00:25:36,901 --> 00:25:39,140
So you've been
  running infomercials?

00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,777
We've run
  one- and two-minute spots.

00:25:40,777 --> 00:25:41,946
Not the long form, but, yes.
  all right.

00:25:41,946 --> 00:25:43,116
And how are those doing?

00:25:43,116 --> 00:25:44,819
They did very well.
  we ran them last year.

00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:47,392
We spent about $1 million
  in TV last year.

00:25:47,392 --> 00:25:50,399
It generated about $1.5 million
  in sales.

00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:51,736
That brings up
  something else.

00:25:51,736 --> 00:25:55,177
How much in debt
  are you?

00:25:55,945 --> 00:25:57,850
Uh, we have
  on our balance sheet

00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:00,156
about $7.5 million
  of shareholder debt.

00:26:00,156 --> 00:26:01,224
Whoa!

00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:05,134
I knew I was gonna
  get to this after that one.

00:26:05,134 --> 00:26:06,604
Whoa! Terry, Terry, Terry.

00:26:06,604 --> 00:26:08,241
And how much of that
  is your own money?

00:26:08,241 --> 00:26:09,978
Uh... [ stammers ]

00:26:09,978 --> 00:26:12,585
a small portion of that
  is mine and my family's money.

00:26:12,585 --> 00:26:15,357
And that means that now
  we're gonna find out

00:26:15,357 --> 00:26:17,897
you own very little
  of this company, correct?

00:26:19,201 --> 00:26:23,811
Um, I own about 35%
  of the company.

00:26:23,811 --> 00:26:27,787
You know, I'm a nice guy,
  so I wouldn't do this to you.

00:26:27,787 --> 00:26:29,357
But if I were
  an opportunistic guy,

00:26:29,357 --> 00:26:31,529
I would just simply wait
  for that debt to come due,

00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:33,066
and then I'd own
  your company.

00:26:33,066 --> 00:26:35,839
Basically, that's what
  those debtors are gonna do.

00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:37,978
If you don't figure out
  a way to pay them,

00:26:37,978 --> 00:26:39,681
they'll own all the equity
  when this is over.

00:26:40,718 --> 00:26:43,156
Uh, we don't believe
  that's gonna happen

00:26:43,156 --> 00:26:45,094
given where we are
  in run rate.

00:26:45,094 --> 00:26:46,597
By the time that debt is due,

00:26:46,597 --> 00:26:49,037
our cash flow will allow us
  to repay that debt.

00:26:49,037 --> 00:26:52,444
But, you know, in life and
  in business, poo-poo happens.

00:26:53,748 --> 00:26:56,988
Don't you think
  a savvy financial investor,

00:26:56,988 --> 00:26:58,893
of which I'm gonna
  include myself right now,

00:26:58,893 --> 00:27:00,163
would want to see
  that resolved

00:27:00,163 --> 00:27:01,667
before I put a dime
  into this company?

00:27:01,667 --> 00:27:06,177
Because if I buy your equity at
  this valuation of $20 million

00:27:06,177 --> 00:27:08,849
and the debt guys
  aren't happy,

00:27:08,849 --> 00:27:10,219
I'm screwed, Terry.

00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:14,463
We will be repaying that
  and addressing that.

00:27:14,463 --> 00:27:16,200
What happens
  if you don't?

00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,174
Well, we'll have to deal with
  those creditors at that time.

00:27:21,914 --> 00:27:23,217
TISCH: How many investors
  do you have?

00:27:23,217 --> 00:27:24,186
We have
  about 60 investors.

00:27:24,186 --> 00:27:25,656
60.
  oh.

00:27:27,761 --> 00:27:29,598
Have your investors
  seen any money back yet?

00:27:29,598 --> 00:27:30,801
Oh, hell, no.

00:27:30,801 --> 00:27:32,638
No.

00:27:32,638 --> 00:27:34,677
This is a story
  about a lot of debt.

00:27:34,677 --> 00:27:38,052
Great product.
  too much debt.

00:27:38,052 --> 00:27:39,187
I'm out.

00:27:39,187 --> 00:27:40,624
Thank you.

00:27:40,624 --> 00:27:42,996
I have gone to the future
  in a split second,

00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:44,500
and here's
  what happened --

00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,304
the debt wasn't paid back,

00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:48,343
and those shareholders
  wiped you out.

00:27:48,343 --> 00:27:50,815
You are now an employee of the
  company with no equity at all.

00:27:50,815 --> 00:27:54,424
The smartest guys on the balance
  sheet are always the debt guys.

00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:56,428
They know your future
  already.

00:27:56,428 --> 00:27:59,168
Luckily, those guys
  are also my common-stock

00:27:59,168 --> 00:28:00,704
and convertible-to-venture
  partners.

00:28:00,704 --> 00:28:01,974
Yeah, but they're gonna own
  a lot more than common.

00:28:01,974 --> 00:28:03,445
No, that doesn't matter.
  that doesn't mater.

00:28:03,445 --> 00:28:04,815
They're gonna force you
  into bankruptcy,

00:28:04,815 --> 00:28:07,287
and anything that you own
  is going to be gone.

00:28:07,287 --> 00:28:09,659
Any assets that you had
  are going to be sold.

00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:11,497
And they're gonna take
  their pennies on the dollar.

00:28:11,497 --> 00:28:14,604
They're not your friend.

00:28:14,604 --> 00:28:16,007
Good luck to you,
  but I have a feeling

00:28:16,007 --> 00:28:18,213
when we meet you again,
  you're gonna be an employee.

00:28:18,213 --> 00:28:20,016
That's it.

00:28:20,016 --> 00:28:21,520
I'm out.

00:28:24,627 --> 00:28:27,467
You know, I'd love to, uh, be
  before you today with less debt.

00:28:27,467 --> 00:28:29,104
Unfortunately,
  the markets told us

00:28:29,104 --> 00:28:30,842
how we could raise money
  to deliver.

00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,179
We're standing before you

00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:35,353
with two products
  with a $20-million valuation,

00:28:35,353 --> 00:28:37,391
which is a fraction of companies

00:28:37,391 --> 00:28:39,930
like total gym,
  like nordictrack, like bowflex.

00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:42,202
These are billion-dollar
  market-cap companies that --

00:28:42,202 --> 00:28:44,808
and you're not anything
  like them at all.

00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:47,314
Those are
  very simple devices.

00:28:47,314 --> 00:28:51,724
How you even spent $7.5 million
  to develop this is beyond me.

00:28:51,724 --> 00:28:53,161
And the valuation --
  normally I'm the one

00:28:53,161 --> 00:28:54,731
who doesn't care
  about valuation

00:28:54,731 --> 00:28:56,535
'cause you can always
  grow past it.

00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:58,240
Now you've learned
  from the wise one.

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,750
I wouldn't call you the wise
  one. But it's just crazy.

00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,487
For that reason, I'm out.

00:29:05,724 --> 00:29:08,430
You know, you're, like,
  in the third round

00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,067
with a young Mike Tyson.

00:29:10,067 --> 00:29:14,344
He's given you two body blows,
  but he's about to cock back

00:29:14,344 --> 00:29:16,349
and crack your head
  to the white meat.

00:29:16,349 --> 00:29:17,484
[ laughter ]

00:29:17,484 --> 00:29:20,993
That debt is dangerous.
  I'm out.

00:29:23,431 --> 00:29:26,606
And then there was one.

00:29:26,606 --> 00:29:29,413
I like it. I think it looks
  like a lot of fun.

00:29:29,413 --> 00:29:31,918
Great way
  to have a workout.

00:29:31,918 --> 00:29:34,859
I think that
  it's a great product.

00:29:34,859 --> 00:29:38,299
You are in serious debt, but
  I think you'll get out of it.

00:29:40,706 --> 00:29:43,311
But I don't like to get
  into that type of situation.

00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:48,524
And for that reason,
  I'm out.

00:29:48,524 --> 00:29:50,362
Thank you, Lori.
  thank you, sharks.

00:29:50,362 --> 00:29:51,431
Good luck, Terry.

00:29:51,431 --> 00:29:53,034
Thank you very much.
  all the best.

00:29:55,239 --> 00:29:57,311
JOHN: I don't know
  if he's gonna get out, Lori.

00:29:57,311 --> 00:29:59,951
His mouthpiece
  is in the third row by now.

00:29:59,951 --> 00:30:04,495
It's one of those slow-motion
  "aaaaaaah!"

00:30:04,495 --> 00:30:06,466
while I appreciate
  what the sharks said,

00:30:06,466 --> 00:30:10,776
I have no doubt that Nexersys
  and our team will be successful.

00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:13,349
We will overcome these
  little balance-sheet issues

00:30:13,349 --> 00:30:14,451
and continue to grow

00:30:14,451 --> 00:30:17,058
to a profitable
  and worldwide company.

NARRATOR: Next into the tank
  is an entrepreneur

00:30:33,095 --> 00:30:37,405
with a product to help capture
  the world in a whole new way.

00:30:47,128 --> 00:30:50,035
Hello, sharks.
  my name is Bruno Francois.

00:30:50,035 --> 00:30:52,307
My product is Cycloramic.

00:30:52,307 --> 00:30:54,245
And today I'm seeking $90,000

00:30:54,245 --> 00:30:56,316
in exchange
  for 5% of my company.

00:30:56,316 --> 00:30:59,924
Cycloramic is a smartphone app

00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:02,998
that takes 360-degree
  panoramic photo hands-free.

00:31:02,998 --> 00:31:05,237
And you don't even need
  a tripod.

00:31:05,237 --> 00:31:06,941
With Cycloramic,
  you're gonna be able

00:31:06,941 --> 00:31:08,478
to truly capture
  the whole picture.

00:31:08,478 --> 00:31:10,249
I'm gonna show you
  a short demonstration,

00:31:10,249 --> 00:31:12,287
show you how amazing
  Cycloramic is.

00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,690
There you go.

00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:16,597
[ camera shutter clicks ]

00:31:16,597 --> 00:31:18,101
[ camera shutter clicks ]

00:31:20,473 --> 00:31:21,508
[ camera shutter clicks ]

00:31:22,912 --> 00:31:24,215
[ camera shutter clicks ]

00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,818
It took all the shots,

00:31:25,818 --> 00:31:29,160
and it's gonna stitch
  all the pictures together.

00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:35,006
And here it is
  in Cycloramic's 3-D viewer.

00:31:37,513 --> 00:31:40,353
So, the base that that's on --
  do you need that base with it?

00:31:40,353 --> 00:31:43,260
No, no, it works on the glass
  or granite countertop.

00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,130
No, no, no, no,
  no, no, no.
  how does it spin?

00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,734
Not the wood.
  the base that's spinning it.

00:31:46,734 --> 00:31:48,973
No, no,
  the base doesn't spin.

00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:50,476
It's the phone that spins.

00:31:50,476 --> 00:31:52,614
How does the phone spin?

00:31:52,614 --> 00:31:54,085
How does it do it?
  can we see it move?

00:31:54,085 --> 00:31:55,221
H-how do you get an iPhone
  to spin?

00:31:55,221 --> 00:31:56,156
Can we see it move
  without the base?

00:31:56,156 --> 00:31:57,326
Yeah, yeah, of course.
  here.

00:31:57,326 --> 00:32:00,667
So, you see, it's gonna turn
  and do a 180.

00:32:00,667 --> 00:32:02,104
GREINER:
  and it doesn't fall over.

00:32:02,104 --> 00:32:03,974
[ camera shutter clicks ]
  no, no, it doesn't.

00:32:05,645 --> 00:32:07,516
O'LEARY: Cool.
  [ camera shutter clicks ]

00:32:07,516 --> 00:32:10,858
JOHN: Wow!
  I want to buy that.

00:32:10,858 --> 00:32:13,563
What is in the app that makes
  the phone move on its own?

00:32:13,563 --> 00:32:16,037
So, what we did is when we saw
  that it was moving a little bit,

00:32:16,037 --> 00:32:19,310
like, with the vibration,
  we play with the frequency,

00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:21,816
which we, like,
  turn it on and off.

00:32:21,816 --> 00:32:24,991
And then we tried the rotation
  with the gyro and the compass,

00:32:24,991 --> 00:32:27,396
and we see how fast it goes
  and we adjust.

00:32:27,396 --> 00:32:29,701
So if it gets stuck,
  we kind of go on and off.

00:32:29,701 --> 00:32:33,410
And we're able to do a whole 360
  and then film or take pictures.

00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,649
So, to be clear,
  the app uses the phone's

00:32:35,649 --> 00:32:38,422
own vibration
  to make it spin.

00:32:38,422 --> 00:32:39,926
There's no extra accessory,
  nothing else.

00:32:39,926 --> 00:32:41,296
There's no extra.
  no extra.

00:32:41,296 --> 00:32:43,501
Do you have a patent
  on it?
  yes, I do have a patent.

00:32:43,501 --> 00:32:44,736
Utility patent.
  yes.

00:32:44,736 --> 00:32:46,207
Very interesting.

00:32:46,207 --> 00:32:47,710
TISCH: Okay, so,
  how are you selling this?

00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:48,947
On iTunes.
  on the app store.

00:32:48,947 --> 00:32:51,319
How much are you charging
  for it?

00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:52,622
Right now it's 99 cents.

00:32:52,622 --> 00:32:54,827
And how -- how much
  have you sold?

00:32:54,827 --> 00:32:57,834
Total downloads --
  around 660,000.

00:32:57,834 --> 00:33:01,142
What were your sales with
  that number of downloads?

00:33:01,142 --> 00:33:02,846
Income is $175,000.

00:33:02,846 --> 00:33:06,387
And what are you projecting
  in sales for this fiscal year?

00:33:06,387 --> 00:33:08,994
Well, I'm hoping to do
  $1 million this year.

00:33:08,994 --> 00:33:12,903
We got like 300,000 views
  in like a couple of days.

00:33:12,903 --> 00:33:14,606
Can I ask you
  about the valuation?

00:33:14,606 --> 00:33:18,248
So you want $90,000 for 5%,
  which puts you at $1.8 million.

00:33:18,248 --> 00:33:19,485
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

00:33:19,485 --> 00:33:22,325
Why are you valuing it
  at $1.8 million?

00:33:22,325 --> 00:33:25,065
Since it's a startup that
  has never got any investment,

00:33:25,065 --> 00:33:27,470
it's difficult to put, like,
  a really precise value.

00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,941
And there's nothing else

00:33:28,941 --> 00:33:30,878
that you see out there like it
  on the market today?

00:33:30,878 --> 00:33:32,816
No, nobody.
  nobody has done it. Nobody.

00:33:32,816 --> 00:33:34,653
So, here's the thing --

00:33:34,653 --> 00:33:38,630
I love your ingenuity.

00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:41,503
Thank you.
  and I love this.

00:33:41,503 --> 00:33:43,407
You know, I can say --
  I can tell instantly

00:33:43,407 --> 00:33:44,978
if it's a hero or a zero.

00:33:44,978 --> 00:33:47,651
I think
  this is a megawatt hero.

00:33:48,686 --> 00:33:49,990
It's a hero.

00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:51,460
I'm sorry to interrupt
  the love fest.
  well, I...

00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,030
Are you gonna make an offer
  or not?

00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:57,507
I am going to
  offer you...

00:33:57,507 --> 00:34:00,481
$200,000 for 10%.

00:34:00,481 --> 00:34:01,651
FRANCOIS: Okay.

00:34:01,651 --> 00:34:03,889
I'm an inventor, too.

00:34:03,889 --> 00:34:06,161
And I know what it's like to
  be you and stand in your shoes.

00:34:06,161 --> 00:34:07,765
I get that excitement
  and that fever,

00:34:07,765 --> 00:34:09,703
and I will work with you
  at lightning speed

00:34:09,703 --> 00:34:12,475
to get this out there
  everywhere.

00:34:12,475 --> 00:34:14,882
I think
  it's a very good offer.

00:34:14,882 --> 00:34:16,419
You may want to know, as well,

00:34:16,419 --> 00:34:19,091
I do have prototype for a base
  that will rotate, you know.

00:34:19,091 --> 00:34:21,229
And I do have
  a provisional patent on that.

00:34:21,229 --> 00:34:22,466
So hardware.
  on a base that turns.

00:34:22,466 --> 00:34:23,869
FRANCOIS: For any phone.
  for any phone.

00:34:23,869 --> 00:34:26,408
So you can put any phone,
  and it rotate.

00:34:26,408 --> 00:34:27,611
Bruno, you know, I have
  an offer on the table.

00:34:27,611 --> 00:34:29,248
Yeah, I apologize.

00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,919
Are you interested
  to hear any other offers?
  I know that -- that --

00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:32,289
or you just want to listen
  to her squawk?

00:34:33,726 --> 00:34:35,096
I really like your offer.

00:34:35,096 --> 00:34:37,201
Do you mind if I listen
  to everybody?

00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:38,771
You know, just out of respect,

00:34:38,771 --> 00:34:41,076
if they want to talk
  and ask more questions?

00:34:41,076 --> 00:34:42,513
I don't think
  I want to sit here

00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:46,255
waiting for them to figure out
  what they want to do.

00:34:46,255 --> 00:34:48,226
So I'd like you
  to tell me right now

00:34:48,226 --> 00:34:50,398
if you're going to take my offer
  or not.

00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:51,968
CUBAN: That would
  be a mistake.
  JOHN: She's very rude.

00:34:51,968 --> 00:34:53,271
That would be
  a mistake.
  she's very rude.

00:34:53,271 --> 00:34:54,775
You wouldn't want to do it
  with somebody like that.

00:34:54,775 --> 00:34:56,445
They think it may be a mistake,
  but I'm sitting here saying...

00:34:56,445 --> 00:34:57,648
Maybe she's not
  the right partner at all.

00:34:57,648 --> 00:34:58,818
That's the real issue
  for you.

00:34:58,818 --> 00:35:00,087
...You've got a bird
  in the hand.

00:35:00,087 --> 00:35:01,658
Maybe you should take it.

00:35:01,658 --> 00:35:03,094
I respect Lori's hustle,
  right?

00:35:03,094 --> 00:35:05,567
But there's obvious outlets
  for this that may not be obvious

00:35:05,567 --> 00:35:07,772
to someone who
  doesn't understand
  the technology, right?

00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,911
These are apps that I have to
  deal with every day.

00:35:09,911 --> 00:35:12,416
I'm an investor in a company
  called condition one.

00:35:12,416 --> 00:35:13,886
They do panoramic video.

00:35:13,886 --> 00:35:16,292
I have a company called
  motionloft that is being used

00:35:16,292 --> 00:35:17,662
by the commercial
  real-estate companies

00:35:17,662 --> 00:35:19,365
that tracks people
  as they walk by

00:35:19,365 --> 00:35:20,702
so they can count
  in real time.

00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:24,044
Mark, it sounds like
  you're selling him on you.

00:35:24,044 --> 00:35:25,681
Exactly.
  so are you going to
  make him an offer?

00:35:25,681 --> 00:35:27,084
Well, I want to hear more.

00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:28,821
I want to hear more about
  what the road map is.

00:35:28,821 --> 00:35:32,129
The application is great.
  it's interesting.

00:35:32,129 --> 00:35:35,872
But your upside, really, is
  to sell it to Instagram or vine

00:35:35,872 --> 00:35:37,307
'cause they have
  the user base,

00:35:37,307 --> 00:35:38,879
and this is a huge add-on
  for them.

00:35:38,879 --> 00:35:41,284
But the exciting thing
  is since you've been able

00:35:41,284 --> 00:35:43,723
to capture the use
  of the vibrations,

00:35:43,723 --> 00:35:46,897
where else can you take it
  in terms of applications?

00:35:46,897 --> 00:35:48,501
Because that's where
  the world opens up for you

00:35:48,501 --> 00:35:49,670
in terms
  of product development.

00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:52,810
Well, there's one big
  application -- is games.

00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:55,517
I've got a company
  called mention mobile.
  that's all they do.

00:35:55,517 --> 00:35:57,422
JOHN:
  I think I've heard enough.

00:35:57,422 --> 00:36:01,866
I will offer you $250,000
  for 10%.

00:36:03,135 --> 00:36:05,273
Okay.

00:36:06,142 --> 00:36:08,013
So now you have to
  ask yourself,

00:36:08,013 --> 00:36:10,853
"how much equity
  do I have to give up?"

00:36:10,853 --> 00:36:12,524
the challenge
  with the app market --

00:36:12,524 --> 00:36:14,762
I've invested in lots of apps
  and tech companies --

00:36:14,762 --> 00:36:16,232
is you're an app
  right now.

00:36:16,232 --> 00:36:17,603
You're not
  a company yet.

00:36:17,603 --> 00:36:19,874
And so you've got to run
  this app as far as you can,

00:36:19,874 --> 00:36:21,411
extract as much cash
  as you can --

00:36:21,411 --> 00:36:22,580
CUBAN: That's absolutely
  not true.

00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,917
You're getting 77 cents from it
  right now.

00:36:23,917 --> 00:36:25,320
That's absolutely not true,
  and he knows it.

00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,624
That's absolutely true
  because the only --

00:36:26,624 --> 00:36:28,027
it shows how little
  he understands the technology.

00:36:28,027 --> 00:36:29,430
Let me finish talking,
  Mark.

00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:31,301
I appreciate your input, but
  it's not useful to me right now.

00:36:31,301 --> 00:36:32,704
You're welcome.
  so I don't want to hear it.

00:36:32,704 --> 00:36:34,108
So at the end of the day,

00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:36,914
if you can build
  a portfolio of technologies,

00:36:36,914 --> 00:36:38,250
then you might be able
  to sell your company

00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,587
a couple of years
  from now.

00:36:39,587 --> 00:36:41,592
So why give up any equity
  until you've had a chance

00:36:41,592 --> 00:36:42,928
to build this out
  a little bit?

00:36:42,928 --> 00:36:44,966
Oh, my God. Here comes
  the licensing-royalty joke.

00:36:44,966 --> 00:36:47,004
Exactly is what you need.
  [ laughs ]

00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:49,109
you don't want to be
  the punch line.

00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:51,883
Here's the deal.
  I'll give you your 90k.

00:36:51,883 --> 00:36:53,052
FRANCOIS: Mm-hmm.

00:36:53,052 --> 00:36:54,588
I'll take a 15% royalty

00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:56,928
only on the revenues
  of this application.

00:36:56,928 --> 00:36:58,230
Okay.

00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,968
I'm the only shark up here

00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:01,372
that actually made a living
  as a photographer.

00:37:01,372 --> 00:37:02,641
Okay.
  and I think that this --

00:37:02,641 --> 00:37:04,713
When was that?
  How did that
  work out for you?

00:37:04,713 --> 00:37:06,083
It went very well,
  thank you.

00:37:06,083 --> 00:37:08,521
So I was a professional
  photographer and cinematographer

00:37:08,521 --> 00:37:10,393
and an editor for years.
  FRANCOIS: Okay.

00:37:10,393 --> 00:37:12,464
That's why you and I have
  a commonality here.

00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:14,569
You have three offers
  on the table.

00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:18,512
Hold on. Lori, do you want me
  as your partner in this?

00:37:18,512 --> 00:37:19,614
Will you let me
  come in with you?

00:37:19,614 --> 00:37:20,851
He may sweeten the pot.

00:37:20,851 --> 00:37:23,089
O'LEARY: Interesting.

00:37:23,089 --> 00:37:27,967
I'm gonna offer Bruno
  $250,000 for 10%.

00:37:27,967 --> 00:37:29,738
Now...
  half mine, half yours.

00:37:29,738 --> 00:37:31,175
JOHN:
  you're equaling my offer?

00:37:31,175 --> 00:37:33,947
I'm equaling your offer, but
  Lori and I will be partners.

00:37:33,947 --> 00:37:35,786
If that's a value
  to Bruno,

00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:38,324
I think it's a better offer,
  okay?

00:37:38,324 --> 00:37:40,129
He's got a lot
  of connections.
  FRANCOIS: Yes.

00:37:40,129 --> 00:37:42,000
O'LEARY:
  You basically have two offers

00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,439
for $250,000
  for 10% of the equity.

00:37:44,439 --> 00:37:46,845
If you don't want
  to give up any equity,

00:37:46,845 --> 00:37:47,947
I'm happy to partner with you

00:37:47,947 --> 00:37:49,517
and do all of the things
  you want to do.

00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,556
I have a question
  about licensing.

00:37:51,556 --> 00:37:54,028
Do you think
  there would be any way

00:37:54,028 --> 00:37:56,501
to license the technology
  to the manufacturer?

00:37:56,501 --> 00:37:58,004
If you want to license
  this technology

00:37:58,004 --> 00:37:59,575
the hardware guys
  bundled with this app,

00:37:59,575 --> 00:38:00,978
that's not a problem,
  either.

00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:02,147
I'm the king of licensing.

00:38:02,147 --> 00:38:03,350
GREINER: Let's stop.

00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,954
TISCH: Bruno, do you want
  two real partners?

00:38:04,954 --> 00:38:07,493
Close your eyes,
  stop for a minute,

00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:08,997
and think to yourself,

00:38:08,997 --> 00:38:11,803
"what do I really want?
  what feels right?"

00:38:11,803 --> 00:38:13,541
breathe.

00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,411
Are you done playing games
  with these guys, Bruno?

00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,120
I'm gonna offer you
  $1 million...

00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:22,027
Oh.

00:38:22,027 --> 00:38:23,097
...For 30%.

00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:29,779
That's more than
  a $3-million valuation.

00:38:30,748 --> 00:38:33,387
It's a sweet deal!

00:38:45,816 --> 00:38:48,790
NARRATOR: Bruno has four offers
  on the table --

00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:52,933
$250,000 for 10%
  from Lori and Steve...

00:38:52,933 --> 00:38:57,978
$90,000 for a 15% royalty
  and zero equity from Kevin...

00:38:57,978 --> 00:39:01,787
$250,000 for 10% from Daymond...

00:39:01,787 --> 00:39:05,028
And $1 million for 30%
  from Mark.

00:39:05,028 --> 00:39:07,467
The only deal that really
  makes sense is mine...
  of course.

00:39:07,467 --> 00:39:09,572
...Where you don't give up
  any of your equity.

00:39:09,572 --> 00:39:13,715
I'll go -- I'll go
  to $300,000 for 10%.

00:39:13,715 --> 00:39:14,884
Um...

00:39:14,884 --> 00:39:16,454
GREINER: And what partner
  do you really want?

00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:18,159
TISCH: Yeah, what partner
  or partners?

00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:21,032
I bring sports business,
  entertainment business.

00:39:21,032 --> 00:39:24,941
I think your product has
  applications in both industries.

00:39:24,941 --> 00:39:26,678
Lori, obviously --
  CUBAN: Ask them to explain
  how the product works.

00:39:26,678 --> 00:39:28,182
See if they understand it.

00:39:28,182 --> 00:39:30,722
As he's making decisions
  in what direction to go
  with the product,

00:39:30,722 --> 00:39:32,926
if you don't understand
  how software's written,

00:39:32,926 --> 00:39:35,366
how are you gonna offer
  any guidance, right?

00:39:35,366 --> 00:39:36,769
O'LEARY: I'm gonna make it
  more interesting for you.

00:39:36,769 --> 00:39:39,008
I'll give you $200,000 for 10%,

00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:41,981
but when you pay me back,
  I lose 5% of my equity.

00:39:41,981 --> 00:39:44,052
So you get back
  to what you wanted.

00:39:44,052 --> 00:39:47,561
You earn it back because
  we're gonna run like hell

00:39:47,561 --> 00:39:49,031
to sell as many of these
  as we can.

00:39:49,031 --> 00:39:52,171
TISCH: Bruno, Lori and I will
  make the same offer as Kevin.

00:39:52,171 --> 00:39:53,575
And $50,000 more.

00:39:53,575 --> 00:39:57,585
$250,000, 10%.
  pay us back, it's down to 5%.

00:39:57,585 --> 00:40:01,560
I will offer you $350,000
  for 12%.

00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,397
Okay.

00:40:03,397 --> 00:40:05,336
Do you understand
  all the offers now?
  yeah, yeah.

00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:07,407
I do have a question
  for Mark.

00:40:07,407 --> 00:40:10,046
How would you feel
  working with Lori, as well?

00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:17,430
Okay.
  I'm not opposed to it.

00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:19,469
So, how much of that
  would you want?

00:40:19,469 --> 00:40:20,739
50/50.

00:40:20,739 --> 00:40:23,077
You're okay with putting up
  $500,000?

00:40:23,077 --> 00:40:24,748
So you just threw Steve
  under a bus.
  okay.

00:40:24,748 --> 00:40:27,321
Yeah. Lori just
  kicked me to the curb.

00:40:27,321 --> 00:40:29,158
Welcome to the Shark Tank,
  rook!

00:40:29,158 --> 00:40:30,562
JOHN: She just ignores her
  other partner like that.

00:40:30,562 --> 00:40:31,731
Oh, don't listen to them.
  do you see that?

00:40:31,731 --> 00:40:32,567
TISCH: Absolutely.
  horrible.

00:40:32,567 --> 00:40:33,635
Don't listen to them.

00:40:33,635 --> 00:40:35,206
Kevin...

00:40:35,206 --> 00:40:38,847
Why don't you and Daymond
  invite me into your deal?

00:40:38,847 --> 00:40:41,220
Interesting.
  GREINER: Mark, we need
  to close our deal now.

00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,924
They're shuffling deck chairs
  on the Titanic.

00:40:42,924 --> 00:40:44,260
This is not deck chairs
  on the Titanic.

00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,700
There is not an iceberg
  in sight.

00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,437
Bruno, do not give up
  your equity.

00:40:48,437 --> 00:40:50,742
I want to be able to decrease
  a little bit of the equity

00:40:50,742 --> 00:40:53,081
for future investment.
  yeah.

00:40:53,081 --> 00:40:54,584
But, you know,
  I don't want you to lower

00:40:54,584 --> 00:40:57,625
the percent for nothing,
  so I'm giving something back.

00:40:57,625 --> 00:40:59,095
CUBAN: How much money would you
  want out of that $1 million?

00:40:59,095 --> 00:41:01,568
I wouldn't want to give away
  that much equity,

00:41:01,568 --> 00:41:03,706
so probably $500,000
  would be...

00:41:03,706 --> 00:41:07,982
Okay.
  so $500,000 for 16.5%.

00:41:07,982 --> 00:41:11,190
So each of us would have
  8.25% for 250k.

00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:13,128
It's a good deal.
  let's do it.

00:41:13,128 --> 00:41:14,765
Come on. Close it.
  I think a better deal
  is I like my --

00:41:14,765 --> 00:41:16,336
do you want to hear
  another offer...
  wait.

00:41:16,336 --> 00:41:17,538
...Where you give up
  less equity?

00:41:17,538 --> 00:41:18,808
Stop. Stop.
  because...

00:41:18,808 --> 00:41:20,846
We were
  just about to close.

00:41:20,846 --> 00:41:22,216
No, you weren't.
  JOHN: No, you weren't.

00:41:22,216 --> 00:41:23,185
Sit down, Lori.

00:41:23,185 --> 00:41:24,455
But can you
  just come down?

00:41:24,455 --> 00:41:26,292
I mean, I'm really close
  to making a deal,

00:41:26,292 --> 00:41:27,829
but 15% seems like...
  TISCH: Bruno,
  we've got a...

00:41:27,829 --> 00:41:29,166
So at 15% -- Lori...

00:41:29,166 --> 00:41:31,103
Yeah?
  ...It's not worth
  nickel and diming.

00:41:31,103 --> 00:41:33,876
So 15%, $500,000?
  yes.

00:41:33,876 --> 00:41:35,815
And you know
  we're the right partners.

00:41:35,815 --> 00:41:37,618
Yes or no. Got to go.

00:41:37,618 --> 00:41:38,788
You gave up 5%
  for nothing.
  Kevin.

00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:40,425
Bruno, you got to
  make up your mind.

00:41:40,425 --> 00:41:41,832
You've got a deal.

00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,066
Deal. Yeah.
  yay!

00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:47,137
Awesome. [ laughs ]
  it's gonna be great.

00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:48,105
Congratulations.
  all right, thank you.

00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:49,473
Looking forward to it.
  all right.

00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:51,074
Congratulations, though.
  TISCH: Bruno,
  congratulations.

00:41:51,074 --> 00:41:53,043
Thank you very much.
  GREINER: Thank you.

00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:54,945
Thanks, Bruno.
  all right.

00:41:57,981 --> 00:42:00,851
FRANCOIS: 15% is a little more
  than what I came for,

00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,853
but I got a higher valuation,

00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:05,522
and you know, Lori, for
  inventions for me, is important.

00:42:05,522 --> 00:42:07,291
And then Mark Cuban, you know,

00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:09,092
for all the startups
  he's involved

00:42:09,092 --> 00:42:11,128
and all the connections,
  it's a great value.

00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:12,963
I think --
  I wanted to get two sharks.

00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:14,131
I didn't want just one.

00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:15,199
That was awesome, Mark.

00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,867
No, it wasn't.
  yes, it was.

00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,001
You're just
  a sore loser.

00:42:18,001 --> 00:42:19,837
All I'm saying is our deal

00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:22,005
would have been much better
  for him.

00:42:22,005 --> 00:42:23,740
He'll probably sleep on it
  and start crying.

00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:24,942
[ laughs ] Oh, God.
