00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:04,004
NARRATOR:
This is the Shark Tank,
where hopeful entrepreneurs

00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,540
get a once-in-a-lifetime chance
to pitch the sharks

00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,175
in hopes
of getting an investment

00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:11,411
to start, grow,
or save their businesses.

00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:14,214
Our company sold
$1.6 million.

00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:15,516
Wow.
But wait!

00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,150
There's more!
There's more!
[laughs]

00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,453
NARRATOR: The entrepreneurs
must convince a shark

00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:20,921
to invest the full amount
they're asking for,

00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:22,723
or they'll walk away
with nothing.

00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:25,926
Your deal is the rabid dog.
I really want to shoot it.

00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:28,028
You're not open-minded.
You're really not.

00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,998
When people come in
that are delusional --
I forbid you to say
what you're gonna say right now.

00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:34,134
NARRATOR: If the sharks
hear a great idea...
Oh, that changes
the game.

00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:37,271
NARRATOR: ...They' ready
to invest using their own money.

00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:38,906
I'll lend you $200,000.

00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:41,341
I've already had people
offer me $500,000.

00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:43,443
I think you guys are heroes.
I think the product's a hero.

00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:46,680
NARRATOR: And they're
willing to fight each other
for a piece of the action.

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,815
10% means nothing to me.
CUBAN: Well, if it means
nothing, don't take it.

00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:49,816
You're making a lot of noise,
Mr. Cuban.

00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:51,218
Why don't you make an offer?

00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,753
CORCORAN: You've got exactly
what you wanted from Lori,

00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:54,855
and you're gonna shop
the rest of the sharks?

00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:56,557
You're dead to me.
Get out of here.

00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,793
"You better sit there
and be still, or this
is really gonna hurt."

00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:01,562
CUBAN: [laughs]

00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,263
NARRATOR:
Who are the sharks?

00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:06,700
They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors

00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,802
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.

00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,873
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist

00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:14,875
who turned a $10,000 loan

00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:18,712
into a software business
worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:24,451
Barbara Corcoran went from
waiting tables in Manhattan

00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:27,120
to building the city's
preeminent real-estate empire.

00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:31,692
Robert Herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,

00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:33,694
is now a technology mogul

00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:38,298
who sold his first internet
companies for over $350 million.

00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:41,568
Lori Greiner, the queen of QVC,

00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:45,606
holds over 100 patents and
has launched over 300 products,

00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:49,409
grossing over a half a billion
dollars in retail sales.

00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,044
And Mark Cuban,

00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:54,281
notorious billionaire
entrepreneur, tech guru,

00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:58,235
and the outspoken owner
of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.

00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:10,931
I'm Lori Cheek,
and I live in New York City,

00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:13,533
and I'm the founder
and C.E.O. of Cheek'd.

00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:16,503
I'm from a very small town
in Kentucky.

00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,538
And I've always been
a very creative person,

00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:20,340
and then when it came time
to make a decision

00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,842
about what I wanted to be,

00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:24,344
I decided architecture
kind of made sense,

00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,780
until I came up with a passion
that was way bigger.

00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,449
I've seen the
cutest guys here.

00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,918
I'm an architect no longer
building structures.

00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,520
I'm now building relationships.

00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,988
Mm, he is cute.

00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:38,392
Say goodbye to being single
and scrolling online for dates.

00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:41,428
Cheek'd is a clever new service
that puts a fun twist on dating.

00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:44,164
My concept has been tested
and proven.

00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,034
After decades on my own
relentless pursuit for love,

00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:50,170
I've Cheek'd an attractive man,
and now we're engaged.

00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,905
Hello, this is Lori
from Cheek'd.

00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:54,041
I have given up everything
I have and know

00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,208
to build this business.

00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:58,111
Failure is not an option
for me.

00:02:58,111 --> 00:02:59,780
However, I am dangerously close
to it.

00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,282
The reality is,
I am out of money and resources

00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,818
to continue building my dream,

00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:06,920
so I desperately need
this investment from the sharks.

00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,942
Hi. I'm Lori Cheek
from New York City.

00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,278
I'm the founder and C.E.O.
of Cheek'd.

00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:35,048
I'm here seeking an investment
of $100,000

00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,984
in exchange for 10% equity
in my company.

00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,988
Cheek'd is online dating
in reverse.

00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,758
Initial attraction
happens face-to-face,

00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:47,494
while interaction
happens safely online.

00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:50,197
I once watched my handsome
friend pick up a girl

00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:52,699
by simply scribbling,
"Want to have dinner?"

00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,634
On the back
of his business card.

00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:58,271
He left with a date,
and I left with an idea.

00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,474
Him handing her
that intriguing note

00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:02,743
was the perfect
non-intrusive gesture,

00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,378
but I didn't like the idea
of all that personal information

00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,547
on the other side
of that business card.

00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,316
So, let's say

00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:11,885
I spot an intriguing stranger
on my morning commute.

00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:14,287
I can simply
slip them a Cheek'd card.

00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:17,324
On one side, that card says,
"You've been Cheek'd."

00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:18,592
On the other side,

00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,561
there's an ice-breaking
pickup line such as,

00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:24,564
"Act natural.
We can get awkward later," or...

00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,266
"I'm hitting on you."

00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,234
[tink!]

00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:28,602
[chuckles]

00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,203
CHEEK: If they're interested
in learning more about me,

00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:31,705
they can go
to the Cheek'd website

00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:34,875
and type in the unique code
from the card to see my profile.

00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,310
Neither party hands
any personal information

00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,246
until you're both
ready to do so.

00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:41,081
Whoo.
So, sharks...
[chuckles]

00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,416
...if you want a piece
of the next generation

00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,086
of online dating, invest in me,

00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:47,921
and now you're all
gonna get Cheek'd.

00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,159
These are kind of customized
for each of you.

00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:52,993
Top one, Lori?

00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:54,027
Yes.
Thank you.

00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,829
Thank you very much.

00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:57,998
Thanks a lot.
You're very welcome.

00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:00,200
Why, thank you.
[chuckles]
You've been Cheek'd.

00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,468
GREINER:
Oh, this is cute.
Okeydoke.

00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:02,602
HERJAVEC: That's cute.
And for you.

00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:03,970
"I'd fill your jewelry box."

00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,138
HERJAVEC:
"I saw you tech-ing me out."

00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,507
[laughter]

00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,743
So, the only customization
on the business card

00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:11,211
is that code at the bottom.

00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:13,580
The I.D. code varies
with each individual?

00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,182
CHEEK: They're numbered
like a checkbook.

00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:16,550
So, tell me
how that all works.

00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,552
You go in
and create a simple profile.

00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:20,654
Right.
There are
nine simple questions,

00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,255
and, uh, you order
a deck of cards.

00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:23,757
So you can order
a 50-card deck,

00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:25,358
or you can customize
your own deck.

00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:26,993
Do I pay for them?
Yes.

00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,429
How much?
They're -- the cards are $20.

00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,765
After your initial purchase
of $20 for the cards,

00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:33,800
you -- you pay $9.95

00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,503
to keep that code
activated to your profile.

00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,271
$9.95 a month?
Yes.

00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:39,472
Do I have to sign up
for a year?
And you can opt out
at any point.

00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:40,841
Any point.
Yes.

00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,976
Aren't most people
using online dating

00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:44,211
'cause they're too shy

00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,546
or uncomfortable about
approaching people?

00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,882
I mean, if I have the
courage to go up to you
and give you a card,

00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:50,650
don't I have the courage
to go up and talk to you?

00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,519
These are all very good
questions, but imagine I'm in --

00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,920
No. I'll tell -- I'll answer --
I'll answer that, right?

00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,921
The answer is, "No."

00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:57,123
Way back, um,
my single days --

00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:59,793
my friends and I
used to throw parties.

00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:03,096
And -- no lie -- we would get
business cards printed up

00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,532
and it'd have the date,
location, the time,

00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,167
and it was like an invite
to a party,

00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,169
but the point was, it was easier
to talk to girls because --

00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:11,838
See? but you still
got to go up to them
and talk to them.
but you don't talk, right?

00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:14,407
You just say, "Hey," and
this way, you know you're
gonna see them at the party.

00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,276
Although it's --
So, some weirdo comes up to you
and gives you a card --

00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:17,544
You don't
have to use it.
No, but it's easier

00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,112
because you're inviting them
to a party.

00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:20,981
You're not going up and saying,
"Parents love me."

00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:22,782
Well, yeah, or you're --
and you just walk away.

00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,517
Which means I'm specifically
interested in you.

00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,186
Oh, Lori, who cares
what we think?
Trust me --
What we give them --

00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:27,921
Do you have people
that are online today?

00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:29,823
What are your sales?
Yeah, how many subscribers
do you have?

00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:31,091
Is this
an existing business?

00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:32,659
These are all very good
questions. [chuckles]

00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,194
O'LEARY: Are you gonna
answer them?

00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:36,696
Absolutely.
It's very exciting.
So, how many
subscribers?

00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:39,833
So, I launched my business
in may of 2010.

00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:43,103
So far, I've reached customers
in 47 states in America

00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:45,305
and 28 countries
internationally.

00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:47,908
How many in total?
How many warm bodies?

00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,209
4,500 active members.

00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,811
So, these people actually
have profiles on the site, so...

00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:52,846
Have they paid something?

00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:53,780
No.

00:06:55,448 --> 00:07:01,354
I have had 1,125 people
pay Cheek'd something.

00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:04,190
So, Lori,
over the last three years...
So, let me ask
the question another way.

00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,759
You've made
hundreds of dollars.

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,862
How are you living?
This is a very --
also a very good question. So...

00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:10,697
[laughter]

00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:13,033
I love how affirmative you are
with our questions.

00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:18,104
Okay, so, I have made $56,000
in 3 1/2 years.

00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,240
And you're still living
in New York City?

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,710
I worked as an architect for
Christian Dior for four years.

00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,113
In the time I was there,
I had a pretty amazing wardrobe.

00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,951
When I came up with this idea
five years ago,

00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,619
I decided,
"This is such a great idea,

00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,787
I've got to make it happen."

00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,789
I moved out
of my West Village studio,

00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,858
and I sold my entire
Christian Dior wardrobe on --

00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:40,026
Wow.
Where are you living?

00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,294
Sofas of all my friends.

00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,563
How much money have you
put into it?

00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:46,700
$120,000 of my own money.

00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,001
Wow.

00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,502
Three years have gone by.

00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,738
Cheek'd is making no money
at all.

00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:53,940
You know, my definition
of a hobby

00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,043
is something that never
makes money after three years.
[chuckles]

00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,112
You've lost your apartment.
You're starving.

00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:01,648
You're not making any money.
And what else can you sell?

00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,117
I've had a lot
of technology problems.

00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:06,152
I'm here
asking for your help.

00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,620
The reason it's not working

00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,690
is because my website
has been broken

00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:14,060
with the subscription model
since day one.

00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,296
And to this day...
So, and you keep on going,
and you keep on spending money.

00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:18,064
You're not doing yourself
any favors.

00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,466
I just got it fixed.

00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:21,968
After burning $120,000, you --
you fixed it 3 years later?

00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,303
I'm gonna figure this out.

00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:25,739
I will take this business
until it is a household name,

00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:27,474
and this is gonna change
the population.

00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:29,376
I mean that.
People will -- people need this.

00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:32,045
Okay, I have a rule.
When people come in
that are delusional,

00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:34,314
I have to say, "I'm out."
I'm out.

00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,885
Maybe I was overambitious

00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,653
by saying I'm gonna change
the population...

00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:43,590
You think?
...But I do think that people
want to meet in the real world.

00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,291
I'm here
with a working website.

00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,627
I'm here with a mobile-phone app
that's ready to launch,

00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:50,063
where you'll be able
to search who's nearby.

00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:51,931
But, Lori, it's the same
business model.
Right.

00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,034
After three years -- you know,
the definition of "insanity"

00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,704
is doing the same thing,
expecting a different result.

00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,339
Lori, I-I want to tell you
a story

00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:00,907
that's very appropriate
for you.

00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:02,242
It's gonna help you
immensely,

00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:04,077
and you're gonna thank me
for it, okay?

00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:06,413
It's a story
about a boy and his dog.

00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:09,049
[laughs]
One day, the dog
went out into the forest

00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,785
And got bitten by a raccoon
that had rabies.

00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:13,753
And the dog
slowly went insane.

00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:18,525
The father made the boy
take the dog behind the barn

00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:21,394
and made the son
shoot the dog.

00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,164
Your deal
is the rabid dog.

00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:27,534
It's a very bad idea,
and I really want to shoot it.

00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,536
If you won't let me,
I have to say I'm out.

00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:34,541
I think you've missed the entire
point of online dating.

00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,711
People like online dating
because of the anonymity

00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,547
and because
they're really busy.

00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:44,184
I just think that the entire
premise is flawed.

00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:46,719
If I have the courage to go up
to a woman like you

00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:50,490
and hand you the card, I have
the courage to ask you out.

00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,493
I think it's
a flawed business premise.

00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:54,494
I'm out.

00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,865
It's a cute idea, but it hasn't
been working for you, and --

00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:01,468
It hasn't been working because
my website's been broken.

00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:02,902
My website is fixed.

00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,472
You know, I just read on your
Facebook wall the other day,

00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:07,440
"The biggest mistake
anyone can make

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,876
is to be afraid
to make mistakes."

00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:12,378
I've made every mistake
I can possibly make,

00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,514
and I will take this
to the next level...
It's --

00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:16,483
...with a small financial boost.
I will.

00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:19,853
You can't let fear stop you
from moving forward,

00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:22,689
but I think, here,
sometimes you have to see

00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:26,893
that something isn't working
and really open your eyes wide

00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:28,094
and look at that and say,

00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,163
"Maybe I need
to do something different."

00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:33,133
For whatever reason,
it's not really working for you,

00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,568
and I don't think
it was just the website.

00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,606
And so, for that reason,
I'm out.

00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:44,811
Barbara, I know you invest
in people.

00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:49,983
You know, uh, I can't fault you
for your obvious passion.

00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,318
When I started
a flower business,

00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,020
for two years,
I killed myself.

00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,489
I totally believed in
a "Flower of the Week" club.

00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,425
No one had it. I loved flowers.
I loved my customers.

00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:02,128
I killed myself.
I worked 24 hours a day.

00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:03,897
But you want to know
what I wasn't doing?

00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:05,365
Listening to the universe

00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:07,634
that was telling me
it wasn't working.

00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:09,869
You got to move on,

00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,771
because it's stopping you

00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:14,307
from going to what
you're supposed to be.

00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:17,210
That stupid flower business,
if I had hung on to it,

00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,579
would have never let me
be a millionaire.

00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:22,782
You're the right entrepreneur,
but this is the wrong business.

00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:25,051
You got to move on.
That's a great story.

00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,353
And that's exactly
what I was saying.

00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,922
I say it better.
Just shoot it.

00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:31,357
[chuckles]
You in, or you out,
Barbara?

00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,660
I forgot to say, "I'm out."
painfully, I'm out.

00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:36,196
Thank you all very much.

00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,298
Good luck, Lori.

00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,068
Wow.
She's not gonna give up.
That's the sad part.

00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:46,239
I'm gonna change the world.
I'm not quitting this idea.

00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,041
I believe in this
more than anything,

00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,311
and I'm not gonna stop until
this becomes a household name.

00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:02,722
NARRATOR:
Next up are two sisters

00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,424
who came up
with an easier way

00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:07,594
to accomplish
a dreaded childhood chore.

00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:10,630
Aww.

00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:16,002
Hi, sharks.
I'm Jennifer MacDonald,

00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:17,904
and this is my sister
and business partner.

00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,106
Hi, sharks.
I'm Hayley Carr.

00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:22,208
Our company
is Zipit Bedding,

00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,345
and today we're seeking
an investment of $75,000

00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:27,614
for a 20% stake
in our business.

00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,882
3 billion children
live on this Earth,

00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:32,352
and none of them seem to know
how to make a bed,

00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:33,419
much less want to.

00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,721
HERJAVEC: [chuckles]
And, frankly,

00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:37,624
aren't you tired of seeing
your kids' beds look like this?

00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:40,059
Well...

00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,361
We were.
We were.

00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:44,364
So, we invented the next
must-have bedding solution

00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:45,765
for parents and kids

00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,867
that's gonna revolutionize
the bedding industry.

00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,636
Introducing...

00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:51,337
Ta-da!

00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:52,338
Ta-da!

00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:53,706
Ta-da!

00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,775
Zipit Bedding!
Zipit Bedding!

00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:59,145
The world's first hybrid
of a sleeping bag

00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:00,913
and a conventional
bedding set.

00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:02,215
Let's show you
how it works.

00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:04,784
All right, sharks, this is
our family friend Ava,

00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:05,885
and she's 6 years old.

00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:07,153
Hi, Ava.

00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,154
Hi, Ava.
She just lost
a tooth.

00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,823
Okay.
So, it's simple.

00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:11,991
[chuckles]
You just...

00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:16,062
...Zip the zipper
like that.

00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:18,431
That connects the top comforter
to the fitted sheet,

00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,400
so now
it's all one piece.

00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,002
Your kids can't kick off
their covers.

00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:24,671
When it's time
to wash your bedding,

00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:27,240
you simply lift off the fitted
sheet part right here.

00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,344
HERJAVEC: Oh.
Wash it in the washer as one,
and remake it as one.

00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:33,780
The kids are loving
the zippered side pockets,

00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,882
'cause you can store things
like baseball cards,

00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:37,583
game controllers,
flashlights.

00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:41,521
But my favorite part is that
if your child can zip a zipper,

00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:43,956
he or she can now
make their own bed.

00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:46,292
And it's fun, like a sleeping
bag, so they'll want to.

00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:49,629
So, Ava, hop on out.
Good job. Ready?

00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:51,864
She just zips it closed.

00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:53,966
And voilà.

00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:55,134
The bed's made.

00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,569
Here. Up top.
You did great.

00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,071
Okay. You're done.

00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,372
Nice hops.
CORCORAN:
Nicely done.

00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:00,606
Good job, Ava.
Yay.

00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:03,109
So, stop making beds
the old way.
Yes.

00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:05,978
With Zipit Bedding,
it's now fun, fast, and easy.

00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:07,146
You just zip it.
You just zip it.

00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,181
That was
our golf swing.

00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,816
Does it unzip
all the way around?

00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:11,417
Can I --
I want to go look.
MACDONALD:
Yeah. Come on up.

00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,486
CARR:
Please, come on.
I mean, I'm just curious,
because...

00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:15,688
It unzips on both sides
so you can detach the top.

00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,623
CARR: So...the zipper
stops at the end.
So -- Oh,
it goes all the way.

00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,659
MACDONALD:
All the way down.
And it's actually
open at the foot.

00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:22,228
Yeah,
this part's open.
And this isn't
our only version.

00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,030
We actually have
two other versions

00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,232
based on comments from moms
that love this product,

00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,067
but they also said,
"Do you have any for a
hard-to-make bunk bed?"

00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,803
So, we have this giant,
bulky piece right here

00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,638
that would fit
underneath here.

00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,041
So, you got the railing.
Why don't you get out the
bunk-bed version, as well?

00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,043
MACDONALD: Yeah, that's
what I'm gonna do.

00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,679
You don't want to have to jam
the comforter side into there.

00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,648
It looks messy. Our --
our goal with this is
to always look neat.

00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:45,151
And this is our
glow-in-the-dark version.
CUBAN:
I got to say, like,

00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:46,819
I would sleep with my brother
when I was little.

00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:49,188
This would have been perfect
for Dutch ovens.
Oh.
[laughs]

00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:52,458
I would have had him locked in
with no way to escape.
Thank you.

00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,694
GREINER: I'm gonna ask you
the natural question for me.

00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:56,062
Oh, sure.
Ask us.
Is it patented?

00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,497
It's patent pending.

00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:58,965
Do you have any sales?

00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:00,299
We do.
We've sold 1,000.

00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,535
We did -- we wanted to test
the market, so we printed 1,000.

00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:04,203
We sold out of them.
And where'd
you sell them?

00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:05,471
We sold them
mostly online.

00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,340
How did people online
find you?

00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,809
Actually, we just used
social media, word of mouth.

00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:11,010
We did a commercial.

00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,945
We put together
about a three-minute commercial.

00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:15,348
Very D.R.-Style,
black and white to color.

00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:19,018
DRTV -- that's Direct-Response
Television Spot.
Right. Yes.

00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,187
Let's stay on the numbers.
You did 1,000 units.

00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:22,054
Uh-huh.
Sure.

00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,189
What was your gross sales?

00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:24,190
What was your net?

00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,359
Uh...
Made $7,500 gross.

00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:29,695
And then we had expenses,
so we actually took a loss.

00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:32,198
But it was just to test
the market.

00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:36,169
CUBAN:
What did you sell them for?
Um, we sold these
for $59.99 twin.

00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:38,104
Okay.
And $69.99 full.

00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:41,407
So, what's your cost
to make one?
We've now gotten it down to $24
and this is $20.

00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,810
That's the best that your,
uh, quote was?

00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,445
You know --
We're working
with a production designer...

00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,213
If you --
if I may -- sorry.
Yeah, go ahead.

00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:49,182
...Who has 20-plus years
in the kids-bedding industry.

00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:50,483
He loves this product.

00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:53,553
He's actually hooking us up
with this bedding distributor,

00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:56,322
one of the biggest, and they
have interest in it right
now. but we want a shark.

00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,458
What do they want
for that interest?
MACDONALD:
Yeah. Um...

00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,060
We were licensing the
functionality to them, so...
What was
their offer?

00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,197
O'LEARY: Yeah.
They were giving us 50,000
minimum for the -- for quantity.

00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:06,232
They're gonna
buy that many?
MACDONALD: Yeah.

00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:10,002
And then it was gonna be 4% for
national and 6% international.

00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:11,571
Have they
given you a contract?

00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,239
We had a term sheet
that we got there, too,

00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:14,607
and then
we actually jumped out.

00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:18,377
Why?
That's everyone's
dream.

00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:19,879
We went to New York, and we
flew, and we met with them,

00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:22,982
and -- and they wanted to pay
for our entire D.R. campaign,

00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,151
so we were really honored,
and we worked with them,

00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:28,020
and we brought in a
broker to handle the
final contractual phase.

00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,423
When it came to do a contract,
and we said, "Listen,

00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:33,125
"y-you're trying to put this on
the shelves in summer of 2014.

00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,460
We think it needs to be here
for Christmas."

00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,528
This was five months ago.

00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:37,663
That license deal
is very close

00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,265
to a very interesting
opportunity.

00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:40,500
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,569
And I think you could get it up
from 4% to 6%.

00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,738
It is -- it's --
Remember, they were gonna invest
money into our D.R. campaign.

00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:48,007
75 million
kids in America alone.
So, it wasn't just the 4%.
They were then --

00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,511
You guys, a D.R. campaign,
I have to say -- big red flag.

00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,281
You know,
9 out of 10 fail.

00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:58,718
And, personally, to me,
this is not a DRTV campaign.
Yes.

00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:03,656
Did you
like those people?
We just feel like they didn't
have the passion behind it

00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:07,860
that we're, you know,
prepared to bring.
So, it was like leaving a kid
in the wrong babysitter's hands.

00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,996
HERJAVEC: But, Hayley, they've
got all the distribution.

00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:11,297
They've got
all the stores.
Yes.

00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:13,032
They're gonna get you out
in the market.

00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,367
They're taking
all the risk up front.

00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,401
We're actually --
the thing is,

00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:16,869
again, we really feel
with this product

00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,605
that it should have been
on the shelves yesterday.
but it's not.

00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:22,041
We're --
But we're so concerned
about being first to market.

00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,644
They're gonna get you to market
faster than you are.

00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:25,978
They've been doing this.

00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,847
You cannot start
from zero

00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:30,650
and create the market
faster than they can.

00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,319
We felt like
we lost some control.
We feel that we can.

00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:36,389
And, to be honest, this is
a long-term product to us.

00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,658
We're trying to revolutionize
the bedding -- bedding industry.
O'LEARY: You're very passionate
about the product.

00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:41,193
It's very clear.
And you may have something.

00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,463
I'm a license guy.
I love licensing.

00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:47,166
I'm the king of licensing.
I could have helped you there.

00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,235
I think this could have gone
all the way to 7%,

00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,504
which is about the maximum
you can do on a license.

00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:53,806
Okay.
But I know you don't
want to go there.

00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:55,675
You've said that three times
already.

00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:57,476
And for that reason,
I'm out.

00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:58,811
Okay.
Thank you.

00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,546
Thank you.

00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,748
I'll tell you,
it's very, very interesting,

00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,584
because one of
the biggest obstacles

00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:07,687
that people
come to "Shark Tank" have

00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:10,189
with a product like this
is distribution.
Yes.

00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,325
You came here
with somebody

00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:15,261
that was willing to take that
risk and get you to the market.

00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,830
I think --
But we also want guidance, too,
and that's why we're here.

00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,566
We're -- we're ready
to bring on an ace in our team.
But I think
you can negotiate the deal.

00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,068
I don't think you guys
really want the guidance.

00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:23,202
You have a plan in mind.
No, we absolutely do.
That potential --

00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:25,104
You know, Hayley,
I think Mark's right.

00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,773
I think you have a very clear
way that you want to do this,

00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:31,177
so I'm not sure
I share that same path.
Okay.

00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:33,946
I'm out.

00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,848
Okay.

00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,953
I think you have
a couple of huge obstacles.

00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,522
Okay.
This idea of an infomercial,
anything like that --

00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:46,826
forget about it.
it's just not affordable.
right.

00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:48,628
Also, you didn't like
the licensing deal

00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,563
because you fell in love
with your product.

00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,898
It's like falling madly in love
with your kid.

00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,834
You're not trusting anybody
with it.

00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:56,702
But there's a franticness
to your love

00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,671
that makes me feel like

00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:01,374
you have no idea
what path you should be taking.

00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:04,010
Our clear path is to
create brand awareness
on a national level...

00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,145
How are you going to do that?
It's all in-house.

00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,748
...With our catchy commercial
and a jingle.

00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:10,049
How are you gonna
pay for the commercial?

00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:11,851
We're gonna pay for it with
the funds that we get today.

00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:13,619
But without
a clear business plan,

00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,721
I think you're gonna have
a heck of a time

00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,757
getting anybody to buy in.

00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:19,425
I'm out.

00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:21,293
Thank you. Okay.

00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,496
We're just -- we really think
the product speaks for itself.

00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,965
Ye-- yes, we do
bring passion to it, but --
CUBAN: Guys, guys.

00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:28,501
You're the type of entrepreneur
that says, "I'm open-minded.

00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,069
"I'm gonna listen
to all your ideas,

00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:31,871
and I'm gonna tell you
what they are."

00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:34,373
Yes.
You know.
You're not open-minded.

00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:35,775
You're -- you're really not.

00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:37,777
What do you think
it's gonna be like

00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:39,278
for us
to try to work together?

00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:42,248
For that reason, I'm out.

00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:48,187
Okay,
we have one shark left.

00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,522
Lori.

00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,828
My belief is that you focused
on the wrong angle.

00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:57,863
I think that you
should try

00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,331
to get your costs
as low as possible.

00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:00,766
Okay.
Sure.

00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,601
I think that you should try
to get it into retailers.

00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:05,471
I don't think DRTV
and an expensive TV campaign

00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,306
is the way to go.

00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,842
We're willing to do that,
as well.
We're doing --
We would like to do both.

00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:10,943
We would like
to do both.

00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,978
I hope when you walk away
from here

00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:16,148
that you will erase that
from your mind.
Sure.
Okay.

00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,184
Because that will be
a waste of money.
Yep.

00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:20,319
Was it a waste
for pillow pets?

00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,254
CUBAN: Yeah,
but you're not them.
I -- you guys
aren't pillow pets.

00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:24,023
You're not them.
You're not them.
It's a different product.

00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:25,157
MACDONALD:
Or the snuggie.
It's a completely
different product.

00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,559
CARR:
What about snuggie?

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,960
There's a different formula.

00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,929
Same with snuggie,
you guys.
Sure.

00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:32,264
That's a different formula.
It's a different product.

00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:34,533
Hayley, you need to be
in Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.
But -- yes.

00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,469
You need to be
in a traditional retailer.
We agree, yes.

00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:38,437
We think
it's both, though.
Um...

00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:40,940
We don't -- we don't see
why we can't do both.

00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:45,845
You guys, four times I explained
to you that a DRTV spot,

00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:48,814
in my opinion,
is the wrong way to go.
Yes. yeah.

00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:53,619
And no matter what,
you kept saying back to me,

00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,621
"We want to do both."
Sure.

00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,723
We d-- we definitely
believe in that, so we'll --

00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:59,658
we'll take your advice,
but I think, you know,

00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:01,293
that is the route
that we want to go.

00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:04,163
[laughter]
So, you know what?

00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:07,700
If that's the way
that you want to go, I'm out.

00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:11,237
CUBAN: Good luck, guys.
Go get 'em.

00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:13,005
I'll look for the commercial
on TV.

00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,340
CARR: Thank you.

00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:21,113
I'm still sticking
to that D.R. campaign.
Yeah, I agree.

00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:24,383
We're gonna get
our commercial on TV.
Okay.
[chuckles]

00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:26,986
Those are two partners that
are exactly like each other.

00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:28,220
Yes, they are.
Oh, my God.

00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,421
They're sisters.
So, one gets off
on a tangent.

00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:30,556
The other one...

00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:32,725
It was like a couple
of zebra finches in a cage.

00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:33,692
What?!
CUBAN: Next.

00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,461
A zebra finch?

00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,429
Yeah.
It was just...

00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,475
NARRATOR:
Next up is a couple

00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,811
with an eco-friendly way
to clean up.

00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:00,886
Hi, sharks.

00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:03,722
My name is Irene,
and this is my husband, Noam.

00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:05,958
We're from Los Angeles,
California.

00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,827
Our company
is cm national,

00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,962
and our newest item
is Bambooee,

00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:13,132
which will revolutionize
the future of paper towels.

00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:17,636
We're asking for $200,000
for 10% equity in our company.

00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:20,339
This is Bambooee.

00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,208
It's like a paper towel
but made out of bamboo.

00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,410
It comes in a roll,
and it's perforated.

00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:27,112
And it fits perfectly
on your paper-towel dispenser.

00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:29,081
One roll of Bambooee
with 20 sheets

00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:33,219
replaces up to 286 rolls
of paper towels!

00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:34,320
No!
GREINER: Wow.

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,621
Because --
because they're reusable

00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:37,990
and machine-washable
up to 100 times!

00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,693
[laughs]
We created Bambooee
because we really wanted

00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,294
To make a difference
in the planet

00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:45,631
by offering people
an alternative to paper towels.

00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:47,766
Let's do a comparison
over here.

00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:49,435
Here I have
a regular paper towel.

00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:50,836
And here
we have a Bambooee.

00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,171
[laughter]

00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:56,141
And like regular paper towels,
Bambooees are super absorbent.

00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:58,878
Look.
They don't drip.

00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:02,748
Bambooees are stronger
than paper towels.
[laughs]

00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:05,251
Paper towels
just rip.
Oops.

00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:09,255
Regular paper towels
don't work when they're wet.

00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:13,926
Bambooees are the only towel
that will work while still damp.

00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:17,463
They'll work in your kitchen,
your bathroom, your shower,

00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:19,999
your stainless-steel
refrigerator, even your car.

00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:21,467
They don't scratch.
And look.

00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:23,469
[tile squeaks]
It's bone-dry.

00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:25,137
[laughter]
And like
regular paper towels,

00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:28,173
You can wash them in the sink,
you can wring them,

00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:29,775
and you can reuse them.

00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:30,809
Isn't that amazing?

00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,311
Amazing!
Bambooee!

00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:33,579
But wait!

00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,481
There's more!
There's more!
[laughs]

00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:39,018
We've recently developed
a floor-scrubbing Bambooee

00:23:39,018 --> 00:23:40,686
that's reusable,
as well.

00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:44,056
Bambooee Sweeps is a Bambooee
but with scrubbing dots.

00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:46,492
They fit perfectly
on your swiffer,

00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:47,960
and the most amazing part

00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,995
is they leave no chemical
residue on your floors,

00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:52,331
unlike regular disposable
swiffer pads.

00:23:52,331 --> 00:23:53,999
Wow!
Can we see it?

00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:55,267
Of course!
GREINER: [chuckles]

00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,469
Now, watch this. I'm gonna use
a little bit of crayon here.

00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:59,905
So, we're gonna
make a big mess.

00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:01,040
Now, watch carefully.

00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,009
Now, you can use
any cleaner.

00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:07,012
So, you can see how effective
those scrubbing dots are.

00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:08,447
Now, watch.

00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:11,283
What you will notice is that
it will scrub, it will clean,

00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,320
and it will absorb
without scratching,

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,691
whether you have wood, tile,
linoleum, even stone.

00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:20,759
And look --
it picks up everything.

00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:23,128
Those dots are crazy!
GREINER: [laughs]

00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,263
And when they get dirty,

00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:26,298
you just toss them
in the washing machine.

00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,600
They wash up to 100 times,
and they're bleachable, too.

00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,035
Bambooee!

00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:33,405
Our products are made from 100%
sustainably sourced bamboo,

00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:36,675
and with every roll we sell,
we plant a tree.

00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:40,179
Sharks, who's ready to clean up,
plant millions of trees,

00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:42,581
and make tons
of sustainable money?!

00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:43,716
O'LEARY: Wow!
Bambooee!
That was great.

00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:46,452
Are you selling any Bambooees
right now?

00:24:46,452 --> 00:24:49,288
Yes, we currently, uh,
have been selling it
for almost two years.

00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:50,856
And? Sales?

00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:53,659
Last year, we sold $122,000
with Bambooee.

00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:57,229
This year, we are hitting
about $300,000.

00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:59,798
So, what'd you --
Is Bambooee
actually bamboo cloth?

00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:01,300
CORCORAN: It is.
IRENE: It's made
out of bamboo.

00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,568
Which is not -- which is not
proprietary unique.

00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:04,470
They make that today?
O'LEARY:
Yes, they do.

00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,271
It's available commercially.
So, bamboo paper --

00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:08,040
Well, they --
they make bamboo --

00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,875
they make bamboo towels,
you know, to dry yourself.

00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,410
And cloths.
And
they make cloths.

00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,078
Yes.
The product is --
But is he right?

00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:16,181
Are there rolls of bamboo cloth
out there currently available?

00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,350
Not this --
not this exact kind of roll.

00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,119
Can you explain that
to us?

00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:22,888
It's -- it's not
the same kind of fiber.

00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:25,824
We have a proprietary
manufacturing process.

00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:27,493
But no patent, of course.
Yes?

00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:29,628
And we have -- we have
a patent pending as
of -- as of right now.

00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:32,564
When you came out,
you said you have a company.
Yes.
Yes.

00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:34,666
We are offering
our whole company.

00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:39,805
Our whole company last year
sold $1.6 million.

00:25:39,805 --> 00:25:40,906
Wow.
GREINER: Wow.

00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:43,008
Oh, that changes
the game.
Wow.

00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:45,144
Can we touch it?
Yes, absolutely.
Okay, let --

00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:48,313
Tell us what else
the other company does.
We sell a variety
of cleaning cloths.

00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:50,015
What was your profit
on that?
$900,000.

00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,917
CORCORAN: Wow.
Good for you.
Wow.

00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:54,119
You could take that money
and plant a lot of trees.

00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,988
[laughter]

00:25:57,623 --> 00:25:58,891
Why do you need
our money?

00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:02,761
We think that if we partner up
with one of you,

00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:05,297
okay, we can actually
take this to the next level.

00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:08,067
You've made an assumption that
people are going to treat this

00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,636
as a replacement for paper
towels. I don't buy it.

00:26:10,636 --> 00:26:12,571
If you're make -- gonna
make an environmental claim...
I guess --

00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,673
...what you should be saying is,
"It's degradable,

00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:16,241
just like paper is."

00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,610
But to -- to say you're gonna
wash this and reuse it

00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,345
means your footprint
is very heavy,

00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:21,880
because you're using
electricity.

00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,382
You're actually
using detergent.

00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:25,317
That's going into
the water supply.

00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:27,519
I don't buy
that part of the argument.
HERJAVEC: No, I-I buy
the argument,

00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:31,090
'cause in Europe, they don't use
a lot of paper towels.
I think people
feel guilty.

00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,525
They use the reu--
the washable stuff in Europe.
Yeah.

00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:34,927
I think that's true.

00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,361
I want to show you
that Bambooees,

00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:38,363
actually, when you launder them,
they become softer.

00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:42,568
And they don't scratch.
I have found out from --
Do people use this
on their faces?

00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:43,836
They use them on their --

00:26:43,836 --> 00:26:45,838
We are working on a --
on a line for -- for cosmetics.

00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:47,573
Thank you. Hmm.
I'll share hers.
I'll share hers.

00:26:47,573 --> 00:26:49,475
NOAM: Okay.
Now, they become softer.

00:26:49,475 --> 00:26:51,710
I have professional detailers
that use them.

00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,545
It's actually
less stretchy...
They don't get --
Yes.

00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:55,314
...than the original.
They get softer,
more absorbent.

00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:56,615
They're softer.
They don't scratch a car.

00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,150
May I see that roll,
Noam, please?

00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,586
I want to see
what it looks like.
Of course, of course.

00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:05,791
What is the price point of one
roll, compared to a paper towel?

00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,593
So, that roll
is our feature item.

00:27:07,593 --> 00:27:09,294
We have
many different skus,

00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,797
but that roll sells
between $12.99 and $15

00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:13,532
in retail and online.

00:27:13,532 --> 00:27:16,602
And, Irene, if that was paper,
how much would it sell for?

00:27:16,602 --> 00:27:21,573
Um, paper-towel rolls are
between $1.50 to $3.50 a roll.

00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:24,510
Wow.
So, it's way more.
Unless you buy --

00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:27,813
Yes.
and there's another --
Yes, but you can go through a
roll of paper towels in a blink.

00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:28,914
In a wink.
Yeah.

00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:31,116
That says it's equal
to 286 paper-towel rolls.

00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:34,386
That's right.
NOAM: Let me -- let me
just say one thing, okay?

00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:36,321
You are not buying
just a product.

00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:37,956
You're buying
three things.

00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:40,359
You're buying us,
okay?

00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:44,163
We're the hardest-working team
in the industry.

00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:46,865
We've been together
for 16 years.
O'LEARY: I believe you.

00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:48,667
But I have to look
at the merits of the in--
Number two --
number two.

00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,602
There's three things.
There's three things.

00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:52,738
Number two, okay?
We have an innovative product

00:27:52,738 --> 00:27:54,806
like nothing that you've seen
in the industry.

00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:56,842
Look, you're a great salesman.
I'm -- I'm giving you --
There's a third one.

00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,410
There's a third one.
There's a third one.
I'm giving you --

00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,712
Let me --
What's number three?

00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:02,714
Number three is this is not
the only product we have.

00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:05,250
We're creating new ways
of using paper.

00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,818
We're doing toilet paper.

00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:10,322
Washable toilet paper?
Don't tell me it's washable
toilet paper.

00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:12,758
GREINER: Now, wait.
That's not reusable.
No, of course not.
This is disposable.

00:28:12,758 --> 00:28:14,693
Not reusable.
[laughter]

00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,362
Disposable toilet paper,
of course.
O'LEARY: You are definitely
a great salesman.

00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,431
I'm a salesman.
I feel the kindred spirit.

00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,099
I rarely say that
on "Shark Tank."

00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:22,067
You're very good.

00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:26,338
I have to look at the investment
for me as an investor, okay?

00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:28,974
I don't find it
very compelling for me

00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:31,276
because I don't want to go
through the educational curve

00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:32,611
to accelerate this product.

00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:34,580
And the other way
for me to do this

00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,615
would be to put debt
on your company,

00:28:36,615 --> 00:28:39,718
and this 10% tip
you're offering me is just --

00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,453
But you've accepted
from smaller companies.

00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:43,789
You have the opportunity
by us being a bigger company --

00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:45,624
All right, look. you know,
you're very compelling.

00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:46,992
Here's an offer for you,
all right?

00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:48,794
This is the only way
I would do it,

00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:51,330
'cause 10%
means nothing to me.

00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,998
I'll lend you $200,000.

00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:55,834
I'll put an 8% interest rate on
it, which is very reasonable.

00:28:55,834 --> 00:29:00,172
And you'll give me the 10%
for incentive for me to do it.

00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:01,506
That's an offer.

00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,509
Okay.

00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:08,146
He's a loan shark, in short.

00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:21,360
I'll lend you $200,000.

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,062
I'll put an 8% interest rate
on it, which is very reasonable.

00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:28,333
And you'll give me the 10%
for incentive for me to do it.

00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:29,668
That's an offer.

00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:31,803
He's a loan shark, in short.

00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:32,838
The thing is, 10% --

00:29:32,838 --> 00:29:34,606
it means nothing to me --
nothing.

00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,409
Well, if it means nothing,
don't take it.

00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:39,278
You're making a lot of noise,
Mr. Cuban.

00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:40,646
Why don't you make an offer?

00:29:40,646 --> 00:29:43,649
You know, I'm listening,
like I always do.

00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:46,685
NOAM: Well, that offer --
I-I appreciate the offer.

00:29:46,685 --> 00:29:48,520
You know -- you know,
we would love you

00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,788
to be together
with someone,

00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,923
because we want you to be
in our commercials saying,

00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:53,825
"I forbid you
to use paper towels!"

00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:55,661
[laughter]
I think if you did that...

00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:56,862
GREINER:
They had a plan.

00:29:56,862 --> 00:29:59,831
We would love to have you.
Make it part of the deal.

00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:02,634
Oh, my goodness.
That's good.
Let's see if any other sharks
are interested.

00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:03,802
Robert, what are you doing?

00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:07,773
Just listening.

00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:09,308
CORCORAN:
Lori, I want to ask you.

00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:12,277
Can this be sold on QVC
like crazy or not?

00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:13,779
I feel
it has to be demonstrated.

00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:18,650
I think it's a great
demonstrable item.

00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,253
And I will tell you, Barb,
I love the two of them.

00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:23,422
I think you guys are heroes.
I think the product's a hero.

00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:26,458
And I love
that you came in saying,

00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:29,461
"Because our mission
is so important to us

00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:32,464
"about planting trees
and saving our world,

00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:34,866
"that we're willing to give
you sharks

00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:37,035
a portion
of our entire business."

00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:40,339
So, I'm willing to make you
an offer.

00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:48,013
I'm going to give you
the $200,000 at 10%.

00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:52,117
Because I think
what you're doing is fair,

00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:54,753
and I admire it,
and I'd like to be a part of it.

00:30:54,753 --> 00:30:55,987
Say yes while you can.

00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:56,988
Wow.

00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:58,490
[chuckles]

00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:02,127
Is there --
Lori, our answer is --

00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:04,329
Well...

00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,632
What's your response?

00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,803
I know that the rest of you
have not had an opportunity

00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:12,838
to give an offer.

00:31:12,838 --> 00:31:14,773
Would you like
to -- to pitch in?

00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:17,476
CORCORAN: Wait. You got exactly
what you wanted from Lori,

00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:20,212
and you're gonna shop
the rest of the sharks?

00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:23,181
I offered you guys
exactly what you asked for

00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:26,151
because I believe in
your mission statement.

00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:34,359
Our answer is yes.

00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:37,229
Good going.
Whoo-hoo!

00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:40,265
We're gonna plant
some trees.

00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:41,400
Whoo-hoo!

00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,935
Nice meeting you.
Let's save some trees.

00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:45,537
Good job, Lori.

00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:46,772
Thanks.

00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:47,873
Bye.
It's a good thing.

00:31:47,873 --> 00:31:50,442
Good guy.
Wow.

00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:52,911
Yahoo!
[laughs]

00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,012
Yes!

00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:55,914
IRENE: Lori was
the best shark for us,

00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,716
and we're really excited.

00:31:57,716 --> 00:32:01,420
It's gonna be the biggest
product in "Shark Tank" history!

00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:07,325
NARRATOR:
In Season Three, best friends

00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:09,795
Dallas Robinson and Mike Buonomo
pitched

00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:12,864
their flavor-changing lip balm,
Kisstixx, to the sharks.

00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:14,199
[laughter]

00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:15,467
That's so disgusting.

00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:17,402
I'm willing to give you
the $200,000

00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:19,337
for 40%.
ROBINSON: We would love
to accept your offer.

00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:20,839
We'd love to work
with you.

00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:23,742
NARRATOR: Let's see
what they're up to now.

00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:28,146
A lot has changed
since our last update.

00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:29,915
My founding partner, Mike,
recently got

00:32:29,915 --> 00:32:31,917
a great job opportunity
and left the company.

00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:34,186
We still meet,
but I handle all the day-to-day.

00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:35,487
See what it looks like.

00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:37,189
Looks pretty sweet,
doesn't it?

00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:39,825
Mark recently bought us
the website domain "How to Kiss"

00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:41,626
and told us to use it
as a branding tool,

00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,929
where our demographic
will come and find

00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:46,465
tips, tricks, techniques
all about kissing.

00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,066
It's already being searched
on the internet,

00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:49,501
and this will be one place

00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:51,670
for them to get
all that information.

00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:57,542
We're here in Nashville working
with artist Danielle Peck.

00:32:57,542 --> 00:33:00,312
She has a song called
"Kiss Me Like You Miss Me"

00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:02,080
that is perfect
for our site and our brand.

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,516
♪ Every time our lips meet ♪

00:33:04,516 --> 00:33:08,186
♪ Kiss me like you miss me ♪

00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:09,921
ROBINSON:
Danielle's agreed to become

00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:11,490
an official contributor
on our site.

00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,525
[camera shutter clicks]
That's great.

00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:15,660
"Shark Tank" has made
a huge impact on my company.

00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,995
We recently locked in

00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,631
our biggest distribution deal
with Kroger,

00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:22,200
and now we have
almost $2 million in sales.

00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,668
"Shark Tank" is the real deal.

00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,203
[smooches]
Ahh!

00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:35,981
NARRATOR:
Next into the tank is a doctor

00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:40,051
with a product to ease the sting
out of the dreaded shot.

00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,862
Hi. I'm Dr. Amy Baxter
from Atlanta, Georgia,

00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,397
and I'm the creator of Buzzy.

00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:55,133
I'm asking for $500,000

00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:57,269
in exchange for 5%
of my company.

00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:58,803
Wow.

00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:01,973
As a pediatrician, I was ready
to rock my son's shots.

00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:04,376
I had numbing cream on
an hour in advance,

00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,845
but when the needle-wielding
fiend came in,

00:34:06,845 --> 00:34:09,247
she said, "You better sit there
and be still,

00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:10,815
or this is really gonna hurt."

00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:12,284
And it did.

00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:15,353
And after that,
like 63% of children today,

00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:16,855
he developed needle phobia,

00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:19,457
a problem that can last
a lifetime.

00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:21,560
Driving home from
an overnight emergency shift,

00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,894
my steering wheel was vibrating

00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,462
because my tires
were unbalanced,

00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:26,164
and my hands got numb.

00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:27,999
I burst into my house going,

00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:30,035
"Vibration!
That's the answer!"

00:34:30,035 --> 00:34:33,238
And with a buzzing
personal massager

00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:35,640
on some frozen peas
on my kids' arms...
GREINER: [laughs]

00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,909
...I could leave marks
on their hands,

00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,110
and they felt nothing.

00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,445
Hmm.

00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:42,213
So, that's how Buzzy was born.

00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:44,082
Can we try Buzzy out?
CORCORAN: Yeah. [chuckles]

00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,184
BAXTER: Buzzy is
an award-winning medical device

00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:48,653
that combines
cold and vibration.

00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:49,654
Thank you.

00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:51,289
Putting the two together,

00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:52,857
you can instantly numb
needle pain,

00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:55,026
and it's been proven
in multiple clinical trials.

00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:56,194
Thank you.

00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:57,996
[buzzes]

00:34:57,996 --> 00:35:00,899
Amy,
how does it work?

00:35:00,899 --> 00:35:02,334
So, if you're getting
a shot here...

00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:03,768
Right.
...So, you put it on

00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,304
and numb it
for 15, 30 seconds.

00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:09,040
So why not -- why not --
And I will not feel
the needle?

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,175
Can't guarantee that.

00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:11,776
As a matter of fact,
what I can tell you

00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,613
is that it decreases pain
between 50% and 80%.

00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:17,616
We're in about 1,200
hospitals and clinics now.

00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:18,883
We actually have
two issued patents,

00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:20,585
four applications
that are filed,

00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:23,321
two international patents
that are in progress.

00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:24,956
Amy,
even more than patents,

00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,791
what's important to me
is sales.

00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,960
Do you have sales
of this product today?

00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,328
We launched in 2009,

00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:33,865
and this year we are on target
for $1 million in sales.

00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:36,267
Next year,
we project $2.5 million.

00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:38,436
Wow.

00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:39,704
We've sold $33,000 Buzzys.

00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:42,741
How many
in the last 12 months?
13,000.

00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:45,076
Are the reps
showing these around, then?

00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:46,478
Like, when they go
to doctors' offices?

00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:47,545
We -- we don't have any reps.

00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:50,148
You're not even trying
to sell them?

00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,349
Well, obviously,
I'm trying to,

00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:52,851
but I'm --
I'm a full-time doctor.

00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:56,187
I know it sounds weird.
Nobody is selling these.

00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:58,323
People are coming to us.

00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:00,158
You have employees?

00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,727
I have 6 moms who work for me
between 20 and 30 hours a week.

00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:05,163
On the $1 million
that you'll sell this year,

00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,164
what will you make?

00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:10,135
So, $660,000
is our gross profit,

00:36:10,135 --> 00:36:12,837
and $270,000
is gonna be our net profit.

00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,173
Our average margin is 70%.

00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,409
Wow.
Your margin's huge.

00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:21,780
The lowest-cost Buzzy
is $39.95 for the home version.

00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,448
Where do you make it?

00:36:23,448 --> 00:36:25,617
I started in China, 'cause
everyone said start in China,

00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:26,751
and the first batch was great,

00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:28,553
and then the next batch
was awful,

00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:30,488
and I spent so much time
messing with them

00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:32,357
that I said,
"Just send me my tool back."

00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:35,193
Amy, was it cheaper when
you were making it in China?

00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,594
You know,
it was initially,

00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:38,863
but the prices in China
have risen so much.

00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,433
My last negotiated piece price
at my U.S. facility

00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:44,502
is exactly what my last
quoted price from China was.

00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:46,771
That's good to hear.
Yeah, good for you.

00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:48,406
O'LEARY:
You're asking me to pay you

00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:50,842
27 times
next year's pre-tax earnings.

00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:52,610
You see anything wrong
with that?

00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:58,183
So, if you think about investing
in a consumer medical device,

00:36:58,183 --> 00:37:01,019
say, for example,
an Ava the Elephant,

00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:03,388
that might be something that
helps children take medicine --

00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:06,124
Barbara invested $55,000,

00:37:06,124 --> 00:37:08,893
and now there's $100,000
in sales.

00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:09,994
I invested $55,000,

00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:12,197
but by the time we brought it
to market,

00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:14,866
I had invested $285,000.

00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:17,268
It's a very, very
difficult space.

00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:19,604
That's why I'm here, because
you've already done that work.

00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:21,072
So, I bet you've got solutions

00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,341
that are much less expensive
for you to work with.

00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:24,375
I'm gonna
tell you something.

00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:26,845
Sadly,
I've had the experience

00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:28,279
of climbing a mountain

00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:30,381
and spending much more money
than I envisioned --

00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:32,450
and I imagine this product
is gonna be the same

00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,252
to bring it
to the medical space,

00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,820
which is where
it should be.

00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:40,258
And so for those
very real concerns, I'm out.

00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,930
O'LEARY:
I have two issues with it.

00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,332
Number one is,
it's not clear

00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:50,101
what your distribution strategy
is going to be

00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,736
to make this
a big product.

00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:53,905
But the one that's really
killing it for me

00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:55,774
and why I got a flyswatter
on Buzzy

00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:57,675
is your valuation.

00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:59,544
You're asking me to pay

00:37:59,544 --> 00:38:03,782
a multiple that's higher than
a large medical-supply company.

00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,784
That doesn't
make sense to me.

00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:08,319
I think what you're worth today
is $3 million.

00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:11,256
You're asking for $10 million.
That's a huge delta.

00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:13,725
And if I'm just looking
at other opportunities

00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:15,627
to deploy
half a million dollars,

00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:17,662
why would I overpay
that way?

00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:18,663
I wouldn't.

00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,200
HERJAVEC: Amy, why do you need
the $500,000?

00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,836
I need the $500,000
to scale,

00:38:24,836 --> 00:38:27,939
because if I am in
even one big-box chain,

00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:29,941
they're gonna need
24,000 of them,

00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:32,210
so I need to order extra
to meet that demand.

00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:34,212
I need packaging.
I need a P.R. firm.

00:38:34,212 --> 00:38:37,248
That's a canned answer.
No. Do you want to look
at the numbers? I mean --

00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:39,984
No, I know what it costs,
but it's a canned answer
in terms of are you expecting

00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,619
to be in a big-box retailer
for this?

00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,688
Yes!
Then who's gonna manage
all that?

00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:46,825
Well, I'm obviously gonna need
to build up the management team.

00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,726
Yes.
I can hire a C.O.O.

00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:51,062
It's a huge mistake
to go into big-box stores.

00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:52,530
Enormous mistake.

00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,599
Because
you have to educate people

00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:56,568
so that they come in
to buy them.

00:38:56,568 --> 00:38:58,203
Doctor, you don't have
to reinvent distribution

00:38:58,203 --> 00:38:59,204
for a medical device.

00:39:00,305 --> 00:39:01,472
You don't get it.

00:39:10,982 --> 00:39:12,984
NARRATOR: One shark is out.

00:39:12,984 --> 00:39:14,786
The remaining sharks
like the product,

00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:16,921
but have an issue
with the valuation.

00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:18,590
Doctor,
you don't get it.

00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:21,259
CUBAN: That's why
your valuation's wrong,

00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:22,961
because you're selling
to the wrong places,

00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:24,729
and you fully
don't understand.

00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:26,631
GREINER:
It's a clever idea.

00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:29,067
I know you feel that this
is more for a personal device

00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:30,702
that you would sell
in a drugstore,

00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:33,805
but the easier path
of least resistance

00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:35,673
would be to go
the doctor/hospital route.

00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:39,277
I don't feel that the deal
is the right one for me,

00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:40,478
and so I'm out.

00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:44,215
Thank you.

00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,617
HERJAVEC:
Mark, what are you gonna do?

00:39:45,617 --> 00:39:47,051
Who else is in?

00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,620
I'm still in, but I'm not happy
with the valuation.

00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,688
I'll tell you
what I'm looking at.

00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:54,459
I would do this deal
for $500,000 for 20%.

00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:56,427
HERJAVEC:
Kevin, is that an offer?
Yes.

00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:58,596
My offer is $500,000
for 20%.

00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:00,798
I've already had people
offer me $500,000.

00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:02,700
They're not me.

00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,068
[chuckles]

00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,970
Amy, Kevin is right.

00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:09,374
His offer
is the right valuation

00:40:09,374 --> 00:40:11,309
for where you are today.

00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:14,279
For you to get to that next
step, it's executional.

00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:17,048
He offered you $500,000
for 20%.

00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:18,549
If he'll have me,

00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:21,286
I'd be happy to go in
on that offer.

00:40:21,286 --> 00:40:22,820
O'LEARY:
I'm happy with that.

00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,455
I'll take his $250,000,
put it with mine,

00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:26,591
but I'm not changing
the valuation.

00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:29,994
You're not worth more
than 3 million bucks right now.

00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:31,129
You're just not.

00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:32,964
So, $250,000 from him,

00:40:32,964 --> 00:40:36,100
$250,000 from me
for 20% of the business.

00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:40,004
What do you think?

00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:41,873
I think no.

00:40:41,873 --> 00:40:44,008
I think that the valuation
of $5 million,

00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:46,210
while we
may not be there today,

00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:49,113
in two weeks,
I may have another contract

00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,381
that brings my sales up.

00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:52,717
Mark, are you in,
or are you out?

00:40:52,717 --> 00:40:54,485
Look, you might very well
be able to get

00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:56,788
to your $5 million, $10 million,
$20 million valuation.

00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,723
The question is,
how long is this gonna take?

00:40:58,723 --> 00:41:00,992
Now, you may think,
"I could just hire a C.O.O."

00:41:00,992 --> 00:41:02,927
That is not
as easy as it sounds.

00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:04,562
You've got
an enormous level

00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:07,165
of execution risk
and timing risk

00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:10,768
that I think you're not
taking into consideration.

00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:15,440
I'm of the mind-set of the 500k,
just myself,

00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,908
for 20%.
The same offer.

00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:18,943
Different approach,
'cause I think

00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:20,345
it's more about
getting to moms.

00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:21,913
HERJAVEC: Amy, regardless
of what his offer is,

00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:25,483
I think three people have given
you the same valuation.

00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:27,785
How do you address that?

00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:31,022
I-I still want to push back
on valuation.

00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:33,291
There are multiple
medical-device companies

00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:35,693
that come from where I am
and scale quickly.

00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:37,495
I see the opportunity.

00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,998
What I don't see is
the infrastructure
and company to do it.

00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:42,567
You're nuts
not to weigh in

00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:44,869
the expertise
that comes with those offers.

00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:45,870
Just think about it,

00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,305
because I fear
your arrogance

00:41:47,305 --> 00:41:49,007
is gonna make you
walk out the door

00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:50,975
because you think
you can do it yourself.

00:41:54,412 --> 00:41:57,048
I am so grateful
for the offers

00:41:57,048 --> 00:41:59,517
and for the consideration
and the time...

00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:05,923
...But I am gonna stick
to my valuation.

00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:08,059
I can't watch.
I'm gonna --
I'm sorry, but I am.

00:42:09,761 --> 00:42:11,763
O'LEARY: Okay, well, then,
I've made a decision.

00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:13,965
You're dead to me.
Get out of here.

00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:17,635
Thank you.
Good luck, Amy.

00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:19,437
Thank you.

00:42:19,437 --> 00:42:21,372
I can say this --

00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,474
Mark,
if you had gotten that deal,

00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:25,476
she would have
made you crazy.
