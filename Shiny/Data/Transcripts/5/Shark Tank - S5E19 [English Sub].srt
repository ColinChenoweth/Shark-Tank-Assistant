00:00:01,802 --> 00:00:03,604
NARRATOR: Tonight, things get
even nastier in the tank.

00:00:03,604 --> 00:00:05,606
You're so full of [bleep]
it doesn't add up.

00:00:05,606 --> 00:00:07,174
There's no chance
on God's green Earth

00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:09,209
that this deal
could ever possibly close.

00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:12,079
Mr. Cuban accused him
of being here for only exposure.

00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:13,981
In the tank,
hopeful entrepreneurs

00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:16,817
get a once-in-a-lifetime chance
to pitch the sharks

00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:18,552
in hopes
of getting an investment

00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:21,054
to start, grow,
or save their businesses.

00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:23,056
We've sold over 500 units.

00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:24,291
Why isn't it more?

00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,493
NARRATOR: The entrepreneurs
must convince a shark

00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,795
to invest the full amount
they're asking for,

00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:30,964
or they'll walk away
with nothing.

00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:32,566
I think
the idea sucks.

00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:35,502
With u-lace,
the possibilities are endless.

00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:37,204
NARRATOR: If the sharks
hear a great idea,

00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,940
they're ready to invest
using their own money.

00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,408
JOHN:
You're the real deal,

00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:43,243
and this
is a real company.
I'm interested.

00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:44,811
NARRATOR: And they're willing
to fight each other

00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:46,179
for a piece of the action.

00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:48,582
Not everybody
is super-aggressive,

00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:50,117
full of themselves,
like you.

00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:51,585
Do your own deal, Robert.
I made an offer.

00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:53,253
Robert, you're trying
to undercut me.

00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:54,521
No kidding, bozo.

00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,557
Yeah, well, you better
put in your mouthpiece,

00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,058
'cause this is
about to get ugly.
ooh!

00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,193
NARRATOR:
Who are the sharks?

00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,731
They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors

00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,200
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,870
Kevin o'Leary
is a venture capitalist

00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,306
who turned a $10,000 loan

00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:16,944
into a software business
worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:19,980
Daymond John is
a fashion and branding expert

00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,949
who grew
his homemade clothing line

00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:24,718
into the globally recognized
fashion brand fubu,

00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:28,589
with over $6 billion
in retail sales to date.

00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:31,325
Robert Herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,

00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:33,460
is now a technology mogul

00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:38,532
who sold his first internet
companies for over $350 million.

00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:40,934
Lori Greiner, the queen of QVC,

00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:44,938
holds over 100 patents and
has launched over 300 products,

00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,108
grossing over a half a billion
dollars in retail sales.

00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:50,410
And Mark Cuban,

00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,213
notorious billionaire
entrepreneur, tech guru,

00:01:53,213 --> 00:02:08,028
and the outspoken owner
of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.

00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:10,030
First into the tank
is an entrepreneur

00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,066
with a revolutionary
new bike accessory.

00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:23,810
Hello, sharks.
My name is Kent frankovich.

00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,014
I'm a mechanical engineer
from San Francisco, California,

00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:28,982
and co-founder of revolights.

00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,884
I am seeking $150,000

00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:33,720
in exchange
for 10% of my company.

00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:36,623
So, traditional bike lights

00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:40,260
generally consist of a small,
forward-facing white light

00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,195
that mounts to your handlebars

00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:44,131
and a small,
rear-facing red light

00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:46,266
that mounts
to the back of your bike.

00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:48,502
Well, we think
this approach is incorrect,

00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,971
considering an estimated 70%

00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:53,073
of nighttime
car-on-bike collisions

00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:55,809
can be attributed
to inadequate side visibility.

00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:58,712
We want to eliminate
that statistic,

00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:00,747
and let me show you how.

00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,420
Revolights consist
of intelligent rings of LEDs

00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,923
that mount to your wheels
and synchronize to your speed

00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:12,559
to create
a forward-projecting headlight

00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:15,562
that stays in the right position
at any speed,

00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:18,165
a rear-facing,
functioning brake light,

00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:21,234
and a dramatic increase
in your side visibility.

00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:23,136
That is so cool.
JOHN: Yeah, very cool.

00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:24,638
Really smart.

00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:27,741
FRANKOVICH: So, demand has been
overwhelming for our product,

00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:30,310
but in order to make this thing
really take off,

00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,579
we need to get to
a more mainstream price,

00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,247
lower our cost of goods,

00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,516
and for that,
I need your help.

00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,585
Who wants to come up
and check out the lights?

00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,754
Ooh!
CUBAN:
I'll try your lights.

00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,355
[ Greiner chuckles ]

00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:43,490
CUBAN: By the way,
that's what Daymond wears

00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,491
when he rides his bike.
huh?

00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:45,659
[ laughing ] Okay.

00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,494
Trust me. Daymond doesn't
ride a bike -- ever.

00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:48,628
Of course I do.

00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,030
All right, you got to
really start going.

00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,364
Yeah.
Okay.

00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:54,468
Kent, how did you come up with
this idea, while he's riding?

00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:56,136
So, I originally
had the idea

00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:58,805
riding home from my lab
at Stanford in grad school.

00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,407
Um, I finished up,

00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,542
and I was going through
a lot of dark patches,

00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,278
and I was just hitting bumps
and potholes at the last minute,

00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:06,780
and I finally said
to myself,

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,316
"man, I need
a better headlight."

00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:10,784
and so --
but I started thinking,

00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:13,987
I didn't want to just go
and buy a more bright headlight.

00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:16,156
I wanted to make
a more efficient headlight

00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:17,958
by putting the light
where it's needed --

00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,093
as far forward and close
to the ground as possible.

00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,162
O'LEARY: Before you finish,
let us -- I want to look at it.

00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:24,564
I want to see
how this is facing forward.
Yeah, come on up.
Check it out.

00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,302
So, the way it works,
there's rings of LEDs.

00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:32,506
They attach to your wheel,
so as they go, there's --

00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,241
at low speeds,
there's an accelerometer

00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:36,042
that's figuring out forward
at all times.

00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,811
O'LEARY:
One size fits all?

00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:40,080
Right now, we're just
road bikes and hybrid bikes.

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,549
That's our first product.
Can I retrofit it
to an existing bike,

00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:43,817
an existing wheel?
yes. yep.

00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:46,153
GREINER: Can you
pass that out around to us?

00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:47,354
The wheel? Yeah.

00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:51,358
Is -- is it something
that you clip onto the wheel?

00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:52,826
Um, so --
any wheel?

00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:54,895
We have --
right now, we sell a kit

00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:57,898
that allows you to install
hardware onto your spokes,

00:04:57,898 --> 00:04:59,332
but we also have now

00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,902
a wheel with the lights
permanently riveted in.

00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:03,937
It also looks like
it could be stolen.

00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:07,207
So, stolen is actually
a big point,

00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:09,776
because that is
one of people's main concerns

00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,311
with bike lights currently.

00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,513
We manufacture them
to be solid rings,

00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:14,681
so when you lock up
your wheels,

00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,016
you're actually locking up
your lights.

00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,717
I'm assuming
you have a patent for it.

00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,319
We now have
two granted utility patents.

00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,587
Okay,
have you considered

00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:23,223
licensing it to one of the two
giant bike manufacturers?

00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:24,224
Absolutely.

00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:25,659
We wanted to get
to a point

00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,195
where we were proving
the market,

00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:29,930
and we started building them
into wheels,

00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,464
and we're using that
as an example.

00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:32,465
Great strategy.

00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:34,100
What are your sales
so far?

00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,737
So, we haven't been selling
for more than 12 months,

00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,239
and in those 12 months,

00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:42,075
we have sold
$600,000 worth of our product --

00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,978
online,
almost exclusively.
oh!

00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:47,547
What does it cost to make?
How much do you sell it for?

00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:51,318
So, currently, we are selling
each individual set,

00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:53,186
front or back, for $139.

00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,021
The full set,
you can buy for $229.

00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,357
You made $600,000
in what period of time?

00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,926
So, that's in about
10 months of sales.

00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:01,428
How much of that
is profit?

00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:04,297
So, we have not become
profitable yet.

00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,332
Okay.
So, we --

00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:07,000
what does it cost you
to make it?

00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,703
The next order we're gonna place
is $100, about.

00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,605
It costs you $100,
and you sell it for $229.
Costs us $100.

00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:13,206
For a set or one?

00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,308
Yes, that's for a set.
JOHN: And why
do you not make profit?

00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,576
Is it because of
the margin, or --

00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,211
because he's investing
and growing and doing r&amp;d, yeah.

00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,646
Or is it because
you're putting money back in?

00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:20,780
That's what I was
gonna ask.
Yeah.

00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,249
It's money back in.
I mean, we don't --

00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:24,551
I've seen strips
that you can put around
mm-hmm. yes.

00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,486
That just are for color
and for fun,

00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:28,188
but this is much stronger,
so do you have --

00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:30,156
costs 10 times more,
though.

00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,492
Oh, yeah. I mean,
those cost, like, 20 bucks.
Yeah.

00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:36,196
But do you have any competition
in this space

00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:39,099
for doing something
that's a very bright light

00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:43,103
that's screaming, "a bike
is right here. watch out."

00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:44,304
so, there is nothing

00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:46,973
that provides the visibility
patch that we do.

00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:50,377
My background
is mechanical engineering.

00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:52,545
I was actually
at the jet-propulsion lab,

00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,614
which is NASA's
unmanned-space-flight wing.

00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:57,417
I was on the Mars
science lab mission.

00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,752
Wow, we've never
had somebody come in here

00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,153
and pitch
that worked at NASA.

00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,789
[ chuckles ]
You're a real
rocket scientist.

00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,157
Rocket engineer.
Rocket engineer.

00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,358
It's a big difference.
Yeah.

00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:07,794
So, I'm gonna
get the party started here.

00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,763
[ laughing ] Okay.

00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:13,033
$300,000 for 30%.

00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,501
[ sighs ]

00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:16,503
Just think about it
for a second.

00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,777
I'll make you an offer
that's probably more attractive.

00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,413
Um, I don't want
any of your equity.

00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:27,948
I know where this is going,
and remember,

00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,582
perpetuity is
the new broke, so --
right.

00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,518
No, but i-i may craft it
in a different way.

00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:35,088
I would give you the $150,000 --
exactly what you asked for --

00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:39,659
and I'd take a 7% royalty
till I get my $150,000 back,

00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:44,597
and then I'd drop it down
to 1% in perpetuity.

00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,599
It's like the wheel.

00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:49,169
It always spins and ends up
in the same spot.
Exactly.

00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:52,172
You keep your equity,
'cause t-t-the truth is,

00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:55,208
the equity in this company could
be very, very valuable one day.

00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,111
Well, first off, thank you
very much, both of you,

00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:59,346
for making an offer.

00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:00,914
Um, Kevin,

00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:03,483
to speak to your point
real quick on the royalty --

00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,252
we're at an early stage
in our company,

00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:10,090
and that cash flow out
can stifle our growth.

00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,692
Bang. Best answer
to his royalty thing.
Would you rather --

00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:15,161
would you rather I lent you
the money, i-i was a lender?

00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,731
Right now, what we want
is an equity investment.

00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:19,766
Kent,
I'll make you an offer.

00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:21,034
Okay.

00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,069
Incredibly clever
and smart idea,
thank you.

00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,071
And you must be Croatian,
with a name like frankovich.

00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,007
[ Greiner laughs ]
Yep. I am.

00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,275
Did you come over in
a boat with a little
rice and rats in it?

00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:30,710
Yeah, absolutely.
[ laughs ]

00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,680
so, you're asking
for $150,000 for 10%?

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,914
Correct.

00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:37,784
I'll give you $300,000
for 10%.

00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:39,786
Oh! Wait a minute.
GREINER: Whoo!

00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:41,287
I think your value
is actually too low.

00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,656
I do think
you undervalued it.

00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:45,392
Robert, you're trying
to undercut me.

00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:46,693
No kidding, bozo.

00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:47,861
Yeah, well, you better
put in your mouthpiece,

00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,096
'cause this is
about to get ugly.

00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:04,044
NARRATOR: Kent has three offers
on the table,

00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,879
but Robert
has generously offered

00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,580
double the money
that Kent was seeking.

00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,785
So, you're asking
for $150,000 for 10%.

00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:12,986
Correct.

00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:15,255
I'll give you $300,000
for 10%.

00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:16,756
Oh! Wait a minute.
GREINER: Whoo!

00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:18,658
I think your value
is actually too low.

00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,727
Robert, you're trying
to undercut me.

00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:21,895
No kidding, bozo.

00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,530
Yeah, well, you better
put in your mouthpiece,

00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,465
'cause this is
about to get ugly.

00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:26,666
GREINER: Wow.

00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,334
That is an incredibly generous
offer, Robert.

00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:32,639
I have to put
the ego aside,

00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,574
and I don't want
to get into a bidding war.

00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:37,944
I'm gonna have to say

00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:41,347
Robert did give you
a very...generous offer.

00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:44,684
I'll step out.

00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:47,954
Thank you again
for the offer, Daymond.

00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,689
I'm still here.

00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,257
[ laughter ]

00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,059
Robert, you have
an incredible offer.

00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,194
I would like to see

00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:55,929
if any of the sharks
who are still in

00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,898
would like to make an offer,
as well, before I decide.

00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:01,101
Such a nice way
to say no.

00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:04,104
Robert's right. It's worth
a lot more. And you know that.

00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:08,108
You have your background
and your experience

00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,643
and $600,000 in sales.

00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:13,713
People are probably
throwing money at you.

00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:18,218
You don't come in and ask
for a $1.5 million valuation.

00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,155
Unless you're screwing with us,
it makes no sense whatsoever.

00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,725
I think there's no chance
on God's green Earth

00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,827
that this deal
could ever possibly close,

00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:30,697
because you'd be an idiot
among your friends

00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:32,966
to value this company at
$1.5 million or even $3 million.

00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,001
It doesn't add up.

00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,336
Did you just insult him?
Yes!

00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:38,771
Because
he's insulting us.

00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,673
Mark Cuban just crapped on you.
What do you say?

00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:42,075
So, here's the response.

00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:46,880
I think that we have absolutely
been looking to find investment.

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,715
The fact is,
coming and talking to you guys

00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:50,116
and the connections
that you have

00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:51,317
and the networks
that you have

00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,652
and the experience
that you have --

00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,154
you are
so full of [bleep]

00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,055
excuse my French.

00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:58,258
Connections is
the least of your worries.

00:10:58,258 --> 00:10:59,692
And I'm just --
I'm being brutally honest.

00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,761
Robert offered you
twice...

00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:02,929
Of what you asked for.

00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:05,698
...What you were asking for
at the same valuation.

00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,400
You didn't even put up
a little bit of a smile.

00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,535
So, what are you doing,
Mark?

00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:09,969
I'm out.

00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,940
Wow.
I feel like
Mark has brought up something

00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,508
GREINER: Kent.
that I really
need to defend.

00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,677
One second.
Lori's gonna --
well, wait a second.

00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,379
Well, then, do it,
Kent. Do it.
GREINER: Well, you go ahead.
Answer it. Answer it, answer it.

00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:20,780
Okay, so --
you have the guts.

00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,649
Don't let people
talk down to you like that.

00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,452
You were so smart,
capital was not a problem.

00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:27,921
You were smart enough
to come on here,

00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:29,923
push down the valuation
'cause that opens that door...

00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:31,658
At the very least, you're
suspicious of his motivations?
Yes.

00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:33,159
The first -- the first thing
that you're bringing up

00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,361
is that capital's not a problem,
which is not accurate.

00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,330
I've been working
for a year and a half,

00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,599
and so has all the other people
in our office,

00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:40,800
without being paid,

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,236
so, no,
capital is actually an issue.

00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:46,372
And, frankly,
the way I see this show

00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,640
is we are able to partner

00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,442
with somebody
who has amazing connections,

00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,978
who has the ability to get us
to the point where we need to be

00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:53,379
to start
really moving product.

00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,448
So, why won't you
just say yes to Robert?

00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,350
$300,000 for 10%.

00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,019
Bam -- you got the capital,
you got connections.
Yes.

00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,020
Say yes!

00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,722
Because
he's a nice guy.

00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,458
You know, not everybody
is super-aggressive,

00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,893
full of themselves,
like you.

00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,529
How do you feel,
making a great offer,

00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,097
and he's not answering you
right now?

00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:12,532
You know what?
You might be right.

00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:14,601
Kent might never close
with me,

00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,536
but I'm not getting that vibe
from the guy.

00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:19,105
Okay.
You're also not getting
an answer from him.

00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:21,074
Make your own deal.
Make your own deal.
He knows that we're out
over here.

00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,609
Do your own deal, Robert.
I made an offer.

00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,650
Kevin, I greatly appreciate
your offer,

00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,253
but I'm gonna have to say,
I need to go with Robert.

00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,854
O'LEARY: Wow.
GREINER:
Congratulations.

00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:35,888
Congratulations, Kent.

00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:37,357
You'd better not
be wasting my time, man.

00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:39,259
[ laughing ]
I'm -- I'm absolutely
not wasting your time.

00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,793
Thank you very much.
JOHN: Good luck, guys.

00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:41,794
T-thank you.

00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,433
So, basically,
what Mr. Cuban accused him of

00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,302
was being here
for only exposure.

00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:52,805
I offered the guy an offer.
He didn't say no to me.

00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,907
What he said was,
in a nice way,

00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,210
"I'd like to hear
what other people say."

00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,379
if I'm standing right there
and I say,

00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,848
"I want $150,000 for 10%,"

00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:04,450
and then somebody,
while I'm standing there,

00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,552
says, "I'll give you
$300,000 for 10%,"

00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:09,255
the normal response is...
[ gasps ] "wow!"

00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,157
he didn't flinch!
Mark, you know what?

00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,759
You're a pushy guy,
and you pushed the guy,
and you rattled him.

00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:13,993
I just sat back
and listened.

00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:15,261
You know what, Mark?

00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,462
I only have the faith of the
people that come in here --

00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,131
no, look,
we'll find out.

00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,632
But I'm not gonna be
rude to people when
they come out here.

00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,034
That's why
they play the games.

00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:22,302
We'll see.

00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,810
NARRATOR:
Last season, Mary Beth lugo
made a deal with Mark Cuban

00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,245
for her product, kazam...

00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:34,914
Whoa.
...A pedal-less
training bike for toddlers.

00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,416
Do we have a deal?
We have a deal.

00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,084
Amen.
O'LEARY: All right!

00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:39,686
I'm proud of you.
[ laughs ]
Thank you.

00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:41,888
NARRATOR:
Let's see how she's doing now.

00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:46,159
LUGO:
Business has been phenomenal.

00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:50,029
Since "shark tank,"
we've done $1 million in sales.

00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,631
Over the next 12 months,

00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:54,367
we're projecting $2 million
in sales.

00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:56,235
Mark's team has helped us land

00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:59,005
the biggest deal to date --
SkyMall.

00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:02,208
Not only are we
in 5 million printed copies,

00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,943
but also online
and with viewership,

00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:06,779
up to 160 million passengers.

00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,683
Mark and his team have helped us
incorporate kazam

00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,819
into our very first
preschool program,

00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:15,121
and I just had to come out
to Dallas to check it out.

00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:16,522
Who's ever been
on a bike before?

00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,523
Me!
Me!
Me!
Me!

00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,725
Yeah?

00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:21,527
Have you guys ever ridden
a bike with no pedals?

00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,595
No!
No!
No!
No!

00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,263
Well, come on!
Let's do it!

00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:27,200
When I walk into a classroom
and see the children using kazam

00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,369
and having fun,
it's just such a great feeling.

00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,270
I think Harrison won.

00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,806
Kazam is a fun way to get kids
active at an early age,

00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,909
build their self-esteem,
and establish their balance.

00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,111
That was cool.

00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:40,947
Bringing an idea to life,
building a brand name,

00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:43,015
and being recognized
as a quality product

00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:44,650
is all I've ever wanted,

00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,419
and thanks to "shark tank,"
that's all come true.

00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:50,289
ALL: We love kazam!

00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:04,337
I'm Lisa.
And I'm Ivan.

00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:06,172
And we're from
Los Angeles, California.

00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:07,840
[ squeals ]
We have two children.

00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,210
Our son, Elijah, is 5,
and our daughter, Vivian, is 2.

00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,945
Wow. That looks
kind of cool.

00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:15,248
Our product was inspired
by our kids.

00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,950
Like most parents,
we want to keep them safe.

00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,019
We want to know where they are,
what they're doing,

00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,121
and that they're not
getting into something
that they shouldn't.

00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,824
IVAN:
When Elijah was first born,
Lisa and I were both so busy,

00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:27,927
so her mom was a huge help
and would watch Elijah,

00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,328
and he's
an active little guy.

00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,731
He would be crawling around,
getting bruises and scrapes.

00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:33,733
My mom suggested
that I design something

00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:35,635
that gave him
a little extra protection

00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:37,437
but also helped her
keep an ear out

00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,172
for where he was
and what he was doing.

00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:40,273
Well,
after I make the lunches,

00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,108
then I'll get started
on your breakfast.

00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,377
I now work on the business
full time

00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:46,112
while staying at home
to take care of our kids.

00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,914
Elijah, let's go!
Let's go!

00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:49,148
Being a stay-at-home mom

00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:52,685
and running and starting
a business is not easy.

00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:53,853
Coffee?
Let's go.

00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:55,588
It's a lot
of hard work,

00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:57,457
but I wouldn't want
to be doing anything else.

00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,325
That's how much we're gonna
have to pay for everything.

00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:00,793
Oh, whoa.

00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,662
We've risked
our family's financial security

00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:04,096
to develop
this product.

00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:06,966
For our latest production run,
I had to, essentially,

00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,135
Max out our credit cards
to see it through.

00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,603
We need the sharks
in a big way.

00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:12,738
There's nothing like our product
on the market,

00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:16,108
and we want to be first
to market and hit it big.

00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:33,559
Hi. I'm Lisa.

00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,927
And I'm her husband,
Ivan.

00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,496
And we created
squeeky knees.

00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,030
We're asking for $80,000

00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,466
in exchange for a 20% equity
in our company.

00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,937
There's nothing
more important to parents

00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,572
than keeping their kids
safe,

00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,307
and our product
does just that.

00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:51,310
Squeeky knees are
soft, squeaky pants

00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,412
for the baby
on the go.

00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,481
I'm a stay-at-home mom
of two young children,

00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:58,050
and our kids
do not stop.

00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,752
When our son began crawling,
I noticed

00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:02,889
that his knees would become
bruised and scuffed.

00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,524
To top it off,
I couldn't leave the room

00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:05,992
without him
getting into something.

00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:09,996
I needed a product that
not only protected his knees,

00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:11,297
but integrated
a fun sound

00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:13,299
so I could keep an ear out
for where he was.

00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:16,269
There was clearly a problem,
and now we have a solution --

00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:17,970
squeeky knees.

00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,640
[ squeaking ]

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,641
[ baby coos ]

[ squeaking ]

00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:32,752
Oh, my goodness.

00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:34,520
[ squeaking ]

00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:38,491
Squeeky knees are
infant and toddler legwear

00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:40,192
that have
built-in knee pads

00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,628
and a squeaker device that makes
a fun and entertaining sound

00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,030
when babies crawl.

00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,766
Their knees stay protected,
and kids love wearing them.

00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:48,167
EVANS: So, sharks,

00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:51,470
who wants to make some noise
in the baby industry with us?

00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,039
I'm gonna pass out
some product.
[ laughing ]
All right.

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,175
So, you took a doggie toy and
you put it in knees for kids?

00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:57,176
[ chuckles ]

00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:58,878
That's not exactly it.

00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:00,646
But close enough, right?
Yeah, yeah.

00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,248
Doesn't it get
irritating?

00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,717
I can completely understand
where you might think that,

00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:06,752
but, like, I come home
from a long, hard day at work,

00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,355
and when I see my son and
my daughter crawling in those,

00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:12,491
[ all squeaking ]
making those noises,
it's, like, an endearing sound.

00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:14,026
It's -- I love it.
I love that sound.

00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:15,695
Yeah, 'cause
you weren't home all day.

00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:17,463
Your wife is going,
"oh, my God!

00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:19,065
If I hear that squeak
one more time..."

00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:21,901
[ squeaking ]
that's the sound of money
to me.

00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:23,102
[ squeaking ]

00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,004
Well, how much money
have you made?

00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:26,372
How many
have you sold?

00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:28,374
We've sold
over 500 units.

00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:31,577
We've -- we've made t-- over t--
a little over $10,000 in sales.

00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:33,245
And how long
have you been in business?

00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:35,848
We've been in business
for three years.

00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:40,586
Wow. You just hit a buzz saw.
Three years, $10,000?

00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:43,522
But the first year was dedicated
to intellectual property.

00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:44,991
We wanted
to patent this.

00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:47,960
JOHN: So, now
tell me where you're at

00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,496
and, uh,
why was it so small,

00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:53,366
and why do you think
it's going to scale big?

00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:55,868
I'm a stay-at-home mom.
We're on one income only.

00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,103
You know, I do my best.

00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:59,672
If we don't have the funds
to do a production run,

00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:01,173
then I'm on social media,
I'm on Facebook,

00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:03,609
I'm putting them on my daughter
at the park, I'm talking to --

00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,044
Lisa, I get that,
but is there a possibility --

00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:07,613
and how many are you selling
off your daughter in the park?

00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,382
For example, when you put
your daughter out in the park,

00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:11,050
yeah.
how many people say,

00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,952
"oh, my gosh. I love that.
I want to buy it"?

00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:14,220
Most people do.

00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,888
I hand them a card,
I say, "visit our website,"

00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,490
and they do,
and people love them.

00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,892
Apparently not!
Nobody's buying them.
If people loved them,

00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,694
do you think
your sales would be higher?

00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:22,928
You know what? I do.

00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,764
But because we can't
market it in a big way --

00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:26,532
we don't have
any advertising.
yeah, we've done
literally no marketing.

00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:30,369
Wait a second. I have a question
I want to get answered.
We have a website.

00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:31,871
Is there a possibility --
people couldn't really
find us, so...

00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:35,241
Is there a possibility,
as you're explaining
why you have no sales,

00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:38,878
is there a possibility
that nobody wants squeeky knees?

00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:41,280
Well, you know what?
There's a possibility
for a lot of things.

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,848
Not right now.
No, no, wait a second.

00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,583
Okay.
I really believe
I may be right.

00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,719
I think the idea sucks.

00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:49,121
And that's why
there's no sales.

00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,524
Okay.
Is that a possibility,
maybe?

00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:52,892
Let me answer this.
Anything is possible.

00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:55,194
Don't smile. I'm giving you
a serious accusation.

00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,896
Through our website,
like I mentioned,

00:19:56,896 --> 00:19:58,030
we have limited marketing.

00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,899
A buyer reached out to us
from zulily,

00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:01,867
one of the biggest
targeted flash sites.

00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,703
They said, "I love your product.
Let's do a deal."

00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,004
they put us
on their flash site.

00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:06,872
We sold through
50% of our product.

00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,140
They said, "we love it."
how much was it,
though?

00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,642
It was like 50 pieces.

00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:10,910
Guys.

00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,111
This hurts.

00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:15,414
So, you guys, normally,
if something's really great,

00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,950
people are lining up
to buy it.

00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,086
They don't just say,
"oh, yay. Give me your card."

00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:22,822
maybe this isn't
the right idea.

00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:24,690
I'm out.

00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,459
[ groans ]
Okay, well,
thank you, Lori.

00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:28,060
Thank you.
We appreciate it.
One thing --
i-i want to say this.

00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,795
We haven't really
gotten it out there.

00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:31,197
We're at the point
right now,

00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:33,199
this is like the jump-off point,
you get in here now --

00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:35,367
right over the cliff,
baby.
you're gonna be able to make
a lot of money.

00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,603
You're going right down.
You could make a lot of money
on this, worldwide.

00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:40,306
We have to think about
middle America, you know?

00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:41,841
In some places --
CUBAN:
I like the idea, guys,

00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:43,943
but there's a difference
between a product and a company.

00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:45,544
JOHN: Absolutely.
You guys are a product.

00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:46,645
Right.

00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,547
But you're a mom and a dad
that has a good idea

00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,783
and is looking
to turn it into a company.

00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:51,984
You're not there yet.

00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:53,652
You always have to
run your business

00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,287
like there's
someone else out there

00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,123
working 24 hours a day
to kick your butt.

00:20:57,123 --> 00:20:59,458
But you're at work,
and you're picking up the kids.

00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,594
But you know what?
I resent that.
I'm not saying
you can't make it work.

00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,229
Full-time moms
don't get enough respect

00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:04,797
in our culture right now.
that's not the issue.

00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,932
Wait, wait, wait.
But that's not the issue.
That's not the issue.

00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:10,302
The issue is,
you're competing.
Right, because I'm a mom
and I have to pick up my kids,

00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,037
that I can't
also run a business?

00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:13,506
That's not what I said.

00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:15,641
What I said was, you're
competing with other people

00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:17,376
that don't have
the same limitations.

00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:19,445
So it's a limit
to be a mother?

00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,680
That's nonsense.
You're -- you're making excuses.

00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,350
The reality is, there aren't
enough hours in the day.

00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,986
There's somebody
who's working full time.
Yeah, absolutely.

00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:28,921
They're not cutting
half the day off, right?

00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:30,556
They're not going
to another job.

00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:34,193
To think that
that person working full time

00:21:34,193 --> 00:21:36,862
doesn't have an advantage
is lying to yourself.

00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:40,533
I'm out.

00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:45,437
Look, I have no problem
with the fact that you're a mom

00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,606
and you're doing it part time
and Ivan's doing it part time.

00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:50,142
I just think
it's a little too soon.

00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,410
I'm out.

00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,813
Thank you.
All right,
thank you, Robert.

00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,548
O'LEARY:
The market has spoken,

00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:58,150
and it's basically telling you
people hate this product.

00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:00,986
I hate it, too.

00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,989
If you keep investing in it,
you're killing money.

00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,091
You don't want to do that
to money.

00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:08,828
This is a bad idea,
and it's got to go away.

00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,095
And you were
my favorite.

00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:11,864
I'm telling you the truth!
This sucks!

00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:12,998
I'm out.

00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,834
Whew!

00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,769
Is he still your favorite?
Not anymore.

00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:17,937
[ laughs ]
Good for you.

00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:20,039
[ laughter ]

00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,007
Daymond, you're the only one
left in here.

00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,809
I was -- I --
make some sense of it.

00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:26,412
O'LEARY:
What are you gonna do, D.J.?

00:22:26,412 --> 00:22:28,914
JOHN:
So, I was rooting for you.

00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:30,349
That's why I was
trying to set up, you know,

00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,617
why it took three years.

00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:32,852
It could have been
2 1/2 years in development.

00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,987
But as everyone spoke,

00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:38,123
you not only, you know,
didn't want to take any advice,

00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:41,861
but you objected, to the point
where you seem very --

00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:43,429
I'm all ears.
I'm sorry. I --
I think we were open.

00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:44,530
Listen.
Okay.

00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,665
When I was on the fence
of investing,

00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:49,335
I just felt that
we would spend more time arguing

00:22:49,335 --> 00:22:51,604
than anything else.
that is just --
oh, man,
not -- not so, no so.

00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:53,672
That's not gonna happen,
Daymond.
You actually
considered investing?

00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:56,575
That is just my feeling.
That's not gonna happen.

00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:57,843
How can we
convince you otherwise?

00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:59,245
Because we're --
we're a dynamic team.

00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:01,380
Because you're not
letting me speak now, either.

00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,381
Okay.

00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,850
I'm out.

00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,685
Oh, Daymond.

00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:09,021
So, can we call you
when we have some sales?

00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:10,422
Come back to the tent
in a couple years

00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:12,024
good luck, you guys.
if you get there.

00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:13,158
Many have proven us wrong.

00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:13,893
Thank you.

00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:17,329
[ squeaking ]

00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:19,932
That's the sound of money.
Thank you.

00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:21,967
Oh, I hated that product.
Can you imagine that
every two seconds?

00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:23,402
GREINER:
Oh, my God. No, I can't.
I hated that product.

00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,005
I can't imagine it.
This would make me crazy.

00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:28,073
We tried. Yeah.

00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,743
I'm a stay-at-home mom.
I'm trying to start a company.

00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:33,646
[ voice breaking ]
I feel like I can do this,

00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:35,915
And if, you know,
a couple of men

00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:37,483
who have a ton of money
don't see it,

00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:39,518
then they don't see --
they don't have the vision.

00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:41,787
But I'm not gonna
let them stop me.

00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:50,663

Next up is an entrepreneur

for every well-dressed man.

00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:02,775
Hello, sharks.

00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:06,445
My name is Mike Quinn, and I'm
the creator of the buffer bit.

00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:10,683
I am seeking $75,000
for 25% of the business.

00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:15,187
You know, before the buffer bit,
I would spend 15, 20 minutes

00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:17,189
polishing my shoes
with a shoeshine kit.

00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,658
The problem is, it's a hassle.

00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:22,561
You have somebody do it for you,
and it's expensive.

00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,463
It's time to change shoe care,

00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,765
and the buffer bit
is a game-changing product.

00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:31,070
All you need is the buffer bit
and any cordless drill

00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,806
[ chuckles ]
for a fast, world-class
shoeshine.

00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:36,442
[ whirring ]

00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:39,278
But the buffer bit is much more
than a shoe-care product.

00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:40,579
There's more?

00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:41,847
There's more.

00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:43,716
Simply attach
the natural pad,

00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:45,351
and the buffer bit
transforms

00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:47,720
into a powerful
automotive-detailing product.

00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,824
So, sharks, who wants
to redefine their shine?

00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:52,992
[ laughter ]

00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,560
O'LEARY: Wow.

00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,694
So, Mike,
all you've done

00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:59,298
is you've made a drill bit
with fur on it...

00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:00,599
[ chuckles ]

00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,568
...To replace
an electric polisher.

00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:03,635
Yes.

00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:06,205
Mike, at the airport,
I got my shoes shined,

00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:07,973
and the guy came out with a --
[ imitating drill ]

00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:09,942
and he was doing my shoes
with the same thing.

00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:11,377
This already exists,
doesn't it?

00:25:11,377 --> 00:25:13,879
Well, it -- it exists --
an electric shoe polisher,

00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:15,981
and that was actually
the concept of the --

00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:16,982
of the invention.

00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:19,618
Electric polisher's
about $14.95.

00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:20,886
Your bit is how much?

00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:22,621
A-a shoe polisher is
much more than $14.95.

00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:24,923
How much are they?
$50 to $100.

00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:26,325
CUBAN:
And what do you sell these for?

00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:27,593
$19.99.

00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:28,927
And what does it cost you
to make them?

00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:30,596
Right now, it costs me $9
to make each one.

00:25:30,596 --> 00:25:33,499
The idea of taking
a power tool to -- to my shoes,

00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:35,000
do you think
guys are gonna do that?

00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,169
I think guys are gonna
look for an excuse

00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:38,537
to use
their cordless drill.

00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,406
[ laughter ]
So true.

00:25:40,406 --> 00:25:41,940
I used to work
in a menswear store.

00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,942
They always say
you can tell a lot about a guy

00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:46,445
by his watch
and if his shoes are shined.

00:25:46,445 --> 00:25:48,147
Mike, could I try it?
Sure. Yeah, absolutely.

00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:49,782
You want to shine
my shoes, Mark?

00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:51,250
You can't afford me,
Robert.

00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,685
And, by the way,
I don't ever wear a watch,

00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:55,854

don't have to.

We're nine months into it.

Mike, is there anything
proprietary about this?

00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,166
Yeah. Well, we have
a provisional patent granted.

00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:43,001
Have you tried selling it
in a hardware store?

00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:46,472
I did. Actually, I took it
to two hardware mass retailers.

00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:49,241
I brought it in there
just as a guy off the street.

00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:51,043
They liked it a lot.

And what happened?

00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:53,445

the fact

00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,848
that I was working out of
my basement on this project.

00:26:55,848 --> 00:26:58,383
Mike, I think you've got
a cool product. I really do.

00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:00,552
I think you can do
a lot of unique things.

00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:03,288
But honestly,
you're not a company yet.

00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,756
There's no structure to you
at all.

00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:06,525
And I don't think
there's enough upside there

where I can get a return
as an investor,

00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,728
and so, for that reason,
I'm out.

about how many men
polish their shoes.

It seems it's a little bit
of a dying breed

00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:23,275
because people are going
more and more casual.

00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:25,244

Thank you.

00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:37,022
O'LEARY: Mike,
I'll tell you a little story.

00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:40,025
I'm a member of a group called
the chevaliers du tastevin.

00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:42,361
It's a secret society
of burgundy drinkers.

00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:45,931
[ laughter ]
And every 90 days, somewhere
in the world, we gather,

00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:48,934
And we drink wines
as old as 1902.

00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:52,504
But you can't do it unless
you're wearing your tastevin,

00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:55,040
which is a tasting cup
made of pure silver.

00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,776
If the cup is dirty,

00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:59,311
you're rejected
from the meeting,

00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:00,445
no matter where it's held.

00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:02,080
Could be Paris,
could be Rome.

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,682
You can't get in.

00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:04,950
I can't believe
I'm hearing this.

00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,186
I keep telling my wife,
"you got to polish my tastevin."

00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,921
she says,
"polish your own tastevin."

00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:10,956
[ laughter ]

00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:14,359
I actually think I could
polish my tastevin with this.

00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:18,096
But, having said all that,
I'm a buyer of it,

00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:19,631
but as an investor,
I'm out.

00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:20,899
Thank you.

00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:23,535

What the hell is a tastevin?

00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,171
HERJAVEC: Mike, I'm not
a member of a secret society.

00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:28,106
I don't even know
what a tastevin is.

00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:29,708

Kevin is full of crap.

You will not be invited
to the next meeting.

00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:35,714
I know Mark made fun
of the fact he doesn't
have to wear a watch,

00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,250
but, you know, I think no matter
how successful you get,

00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,252
it's always the little things
that count.

00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:42,854
Showing up on time,
having a clean pair of shoes --

00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:44,356
goes a long way.

00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:48,760
To be successful, you got to
  look successful in most things.

00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,796
Until you become Mr. Cuban.
Then you can look like a slob.

00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:53,165
Hey, I've always been a slob.
It's worked.

00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:55,634
But I respect someone with
a good-looking pair of shoes.

00:28:55,634 --> 00:28:57,903
Just -- I don't know
at this point

00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:00,439
whether you've developed
the market or not,

00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:02,808
and I wouldn't
buy this product.

00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:04,076
I'm out.

00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:07,346
All right. Thank you.

00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:09,314
Good luck.
And that's
a clean pair of shoes.

00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:10,315
All right, thank you.

00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:12,551
[ whirring ]

00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:14,353
CUBAN: How do you
spell "testavant"?
O'LEARY: Tastevin.

00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:15,687
Yeah, what was that?

00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:17,990
Chevaliers du tastevin.
Google it right now.

00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,025
So, you get kicked out
of your little club
if your cup is dirty?
Spell --

00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:21,827
yes, it's -- it's
the very famous silver cup

00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:23,862
you wear
around your neck.
i-i'm just curious.

00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:25,130
Obviously,
you're not a member.

00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:28,300
"ever since its creation
in 1934, the confrérie"...

00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,268
It's real?

00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:30,402
Imagine 20 Kevin o'learys

00:29:30,402 --> 00:29:32,504
with the little cups
around their necks.

00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:34,072
No, no, it's 80.
It's 80.

00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:35,540
"the order has some 12,000

00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,676
knights of chevaliers
worldwide."
you said there was 80.

00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:38,810
In our chapter.

NARRATOR:
Next into the tank

00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:56,128
is a product to make sneakers
more functional and fashionable.

00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,773
Hello, sharks.
My name is Tim talley.

00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:09,241
I'm from Rochester, New York.

00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:10,742
My company is u-lace,

00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:14,379
and I'm seeking $200,000
in return for 25% of my company.

00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:16,648
If you have kids,
you probably already know this,

00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,618
but the average American kid
owns over 10 pairs of sneakers.

00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:21,753
But why do they need
so many pairs of sneakers?

00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:23,121
Well, it's really quite simple.

00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:25,590
They need the variety to express
their own sense of style

00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,193
and to hook up with other things
in their wardrobe.

00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:30,228
But what if
those same pairs of sneakers

00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:32,264
could quickly, easily,
and inexpensively

00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:34,299
be customized
again and again and again,

00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:36,401
turning each
of those pairs of sneakers

00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:38,370
into millions
of pairs of sneakers?

00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:41,373
Well, sharks, I'm here today
with some awesome news.

00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:44,710
My product, u-lace
sneaker customizing laces,

00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,945
makes all of this possible
and more.

00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:49,247
U-laces are
elastic shoelace inserts

00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:52,084
that enable users to lace
multiple colors and patterns

00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:53,218
into their sneakers.

00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:54,886
U-laces pop in and out
with ease,

00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:57,222
which means you can swap colors
or change patterns

00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:58,290
as often as you like.

00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,092
What's more,
once laced with u-lace,

00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:02,260
sneakers instantly become
slip-ons

00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,895
that never need to be tied.

00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:06,298
So you get to say hello
to customization,

00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:07,399
hello to slip-ons,

00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:10,202
and bye-bye
to bows that come untied.

00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:13,004
U-lace truly puts the "kick"
back into kicks.

00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:16,341
Sharks, I have a pair of
sneakers for each of you today.

00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:17,476
Oh, cool.

00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:19,511
All right! This is the way
to start off a pitch.

00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:21,113
[ laughter ]

00:31:21,113 --> 00:31:24,483
Robert, I believe these are
your home-city colors.
Thank you.

00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:26,385
Lori, these are
cool fashion metallics.

00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:27,753
I like them.

00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:29,788
Kevin, these are
your country colors.
O'LEARY: Yeah.

00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:32,858
Daymond,
your high-school colors.
Nice!

00:31:32,858 --> 00:31:36,495
And yes, Mark, these are
the mavericks' colors.
Yes, sir.

00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:39,731
School colors, team colors,
fashion colors, country colors,

00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:43,168
whatever colors -- with u-lace,
the possibilities are endless.

00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:45,670
Sharks, we have
an award-winning product,

00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:49,341
we have the market's attention,
and we have global distribution.

00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:52,411
What we really need now is
a really cool partner like you.

00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:56,381
So, you know what they say --
"if the shoe fits, invest."

00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,917
that's interesting.
so, it works
by just simply

00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,286
putting one in one side
like this,

00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:04,823
and then just going right
through underneath the top.
absolutely.

00:32:04,823 --> 00:32:08,059
So, there's just
this little hook piece.
Just a little tab.

00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,828
I take out the existing lace,
and I replace it with yours?

00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:12,130
You take out the existing lace
and replace it with ours.
Show us the packaging.

00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,932
Give us a few packages
to look at.

00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,935
So, Tim, how do I tighten it
once it's in?

00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:21,139
The cool thing about it is
that you can fine-tune the fit

00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:22,774
um, by -- by changing
the design pattern.

00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,010
So, there are design patterns
that are very loose.

00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,579
We have skateboard kids that
like to have a very loose fit.

00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:30,182
Oh, so you can stretch
it across two holes
for extra tightness?

00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:34,052
You get to choose any two
eyelet holes on the shoe
right. Oh, I see.

00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:35,587
Per -- p-per u-lace.

00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:36,621
How much?

00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,857
We sell that pack
for $3.49.

00:32:38,857 --> 00:32:40,358
And what does it cost you
to make it?

00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:41,526
35 cents.

00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:42,561
Yes!
[ Greiner laughs ]

00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:44,062
nice.

00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:45,864
Walk us through
your distribution strategy.

00:32:45,864 --> 00:32:48,467
Well, we have
a global distribution network.

00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:49,801
Basically,
they pay for everything.

00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,102
They order through us.

00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:54,573
We -- we make about a 50%
profit margin just on that.

00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:56,374
And you've been in business
how many years?

00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:58,977
We started shipping this product
in 2009, and then we've been --

00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,645
what will you do this year
in sales?

00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,648
This year, through August,
we're at $193,000.

00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:04,783
$193,000?

00:33:04,783 --> 00:33:06,952
Yes.
Tim,
why isn't it more?

00:33:06,952 --> 00:33:09,221
Yeah.
You've got distribution
in place.

00:33:09,221 --> 00:33:10,889
After four years,
why isn't it more?

00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:13,692
I'll tell you why it isn't more.
We came out in 2009.

00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:15,393
We were named
number-one hot new product

00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:18,263
in Japan in 2010,
and then it just took off.

00:33:18,263 --> 00:33:20,198
So we did about $300,000.

00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:22,501
But then what happened was
the earthquake and tsunami came

00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:24,069
and buried
our Japanese distributor.

00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:26,505
Why do the Japanese love it
and the Americans don't?

00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:27,939
I invented the product
in Japan.

00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,574
I was actually trendspotting
in Japan

00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:30,876
when I came up with the idea.

00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:32,577
I left my job,
and I went to Japan,

00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:34,012
specifically going
to find an idea.

00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,280
What was your job?

00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,483
I ran the biggest business
for new era cap company.

00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:40,051
Right. For new era.

00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:41,887
So that's why you were
trendspotting, 'cause that's --

00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:43,722
that's not a word
that a normal person uses

00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:45,423
unless they're
in the fashion industry.

00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:47,792
So, Tim, my little risk antenna
just went up

00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:49,394
because trendspotting
is meaning

00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:52,998
that a trend comes,
peaks, goes.

00:33:52,998 --> 00:33:54,366
No, that's a fad.

00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:55,500
[ laughter ]
Well...

00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,801
No, that's a fad.
You got him!

00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:58,336
Ba-bam!
GREINER: Well said.

00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:01,439
That's a fad. A trend --
a trend can last for
many, many, many years.

00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:02,641
Yeah,
but poo-poo happens,

00:34:02,641 --> 00:34:04,376
and all of a sudden,
it slowed down,

00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,211
but it hasn't taken off
stateside yet.

00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:08,580
But the pricing wasn't
necessarily right,
and the packaging.

00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,550
We were putting more
product in the package than,
you know, enough product.

00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,485
Like, there were 16 segments
in the package, so --

00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:15,420
CUBAN: Okay. and you were
selling that for how much?

00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,555
$7.99.

00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:17,989
And you're saying
that was too high a price

00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,524
because you had
too much product in there.

00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:20,759
Absolutely.
How much is it now?

00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:22,093
Or maybe people didn't want
that many all at once.

00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:23,361
That's right.

00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:26,665
So, what we saw as soon
as we reconfigured this product

00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:30,001
was we saw our sales going up
to about six to eight packs

00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:31,002
per order.

00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:32,671
It made it
kind of a no-brainer.

00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:34,372
And we're gonna do $400,000
this year.

00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:36,007
Are you not selling
in America?

00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:38,310
We're not selling in America
beyond our own online

00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:40,345
and a couple
big online sneaker retailers.

00:34:40,345 --> 00:34:41,846
Why is that, Tim?

00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:44,249
I think because we didn't have
the product configuration right,

00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:46,151
and I really wanted
to fine-tune and test this.

00:34:46,151 --> 00:34:47,652
I thought,
"we got one chance here."

00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:51,056
the sneaker business
is a $60 billion business.

00:34:51,056 --> 00:34:53,558
Don't start
doing that, man.
No, no, no. I'm just saying
it's a big business.

00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:55,226
This should be sitting
at the register

00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:56,828
at every large retailer
of sneakers.

00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:58,196
JOHN: How many competitors
are out there?

00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:00,298
There's a couple
other products out

00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:02,734
that are made out of,
like, silicone or rubber.

00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:03,902
Is nobody doing this

00:35:03,902 --> 00:35:06,037
where you have
that little piece on the end?

00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:08,106
Absolutely not, because
we have -- we have a patent.

00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:11,042
This is not that easy to do,
by the way.

00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,310
Um,
it's actually pretty easy

00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,945
once you get used to kind of
pulling them in and out.

00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,480
Yeah,
once you got it in --

00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,015
you're right,
the first time is hard.

00:35:17,015 --> 00:35:18,450
What if I wanted
to play a pickup game?

00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,919
Can it hold up, you know,
so I can play in these?

00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:22,020
You know,
I can play in these.

00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:24,656
O'LEARY:
I rarely do this,

00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:26,257
but I'm gonna ask Daymond
for some advice.

00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:28,326
Yes, you should bathe more
often, 'cause I sit next to you.

00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:30,595
[ laughter ]
So, bottom line is what?

00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:32,063
How long is this
gonna stay trendy?

00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,333
It could be forever.

00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,635
You think that?

00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,503
This could be
a long player.
I'm interested.

00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:39,871
No, you know what?

00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:42,007
Matter of fact, I don't think
this is gonna last much longer.

00:35:42,007 --> 00:35:42,941
[ laughter ]

00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:45,543
Tim, what's the projection
for u-lace?

00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:48,413
We believe we can do
almost $2 million next year.

00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:49,748
What?!

00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:50,915
I believe so.

00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:52,384
It's a big ramp,
my friend.

00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:55,487
Tell me -- tell me how --
tell me what the game plan --

00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,422
we basically want to go
back to those guys,

00:35:57,422 --> 00:35:59,658
to -- to the big retailers
that are very interested,

00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,726
and maybe not t--

00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:04,062
try to take off a big a bite
as they wanted us to take off.

00:36:04,062 --> 00:36:05,664
But, Tim,
the key to the strategy

00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,432
is getting
a couple large retailers.

00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:09,734
That's the only way
you're gonna get to $2 million.

00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,403
Absolutely.

00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:15,674
I'm gonna make this easy,
because, you know, I like you.

00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,375
I think you're a hero.

00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:19,177
I think the idea --
he's not a zero?

00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,945
He's not a zero.
Well, that's good.
That's good news.

00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:22,514
My mom will be happy
to hear that.
He's a hero.

00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:24,182
But one of the problems
I have with this --

00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,818
I don't find it
very comfortable,

00:36:26,818 --> 00:36:30,455
because I'm feeling
these little pieces underneath

00:36:30,455 --> 00:36:32,123
hitting
the top of my foot.

00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:34,526
We -- we recommend that you wear
a shoe with a padded tongue.

00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:36,027
It is a --
it is a fashion product.

00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,462
Most kids don't care,
though, right?

00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:39,164
The kids that are
doing this, like --
kids don't.

00:36:39,164 --> 00:36:40,265
I mean,
they're either not --

00:36:40,265 --> 00:36:41,800
their -- their shoelaces
are completely undone,

00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,301
and they're trying
not to trip over them, right?

00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:45,704
Yeah. I just feel that this is
not probably the right --

00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,672
so, before you --
before you totally drop out,

00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:49,941
just -- I want to tell you
a little bit more about me.

00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:52,377
Um, you know,
when I was in college,

00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,379
chairman of the engineering
department called me in

00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,781
and said,
"Tim, you're outclassed.

00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:58,783
"you're never gonna get
an engineering degree.

00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:01,019
"you don't have to an engineer.
You can be an electrician.

00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:03,722
You know, why don't you
drop out of school, save
your parents some money --"

00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:07,192
this is your prof
trash-talking?
this is not
a good professor.

00:37:07,192 --> 00:37:09,127
"join the army
and learn a trade."

00:37:09,127 --> 00:37:12,564
and what I did was I got rid
of stuff that didn't matter.

00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:13,732
I stopped running track

00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:15,633
'cause I wasn't gonna make money
running track.

00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:18,436
And three years later,
when he passed me my diploma,

00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:19,571
he said to me -- he said,

00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,339
"Tim, I'm sorry
I didn't believe in you

00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:23,074
as much
as you believed in yourself."

00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:27,312
I think this will do
extremely well.

00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:31,549
I just don't think, for me,
um, this is the right product.

00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:32,517
I'm out.

00:37:32,517 --> 00:37:35,120
Look, Tim,
I love that story.

00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,256
I think if so many other people
just learn from that --

00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,458
get rid of the stuff
that doesn't matter in your life

00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,293
and focus on the stuff
that does, right?

00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:44,929
Well --
laser-like focus,
my friend.

00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,664
I got rid
of my apartment.

00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:49,267
I live in a rented room
in a friend's house.

00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,035
I used to drive
a drop-top Porsche.

00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:53,004
I mean, I was
pretty well compensated.

00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:54,539
I got rid of my car.

00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:57,442
I got lean
because I believe in this

00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,110
and I know what it can be.

00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,147
I just need
the right partners.

00:38:02,147 --> 00:38:05,316
So, you've kept me in
this entire time

00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:06,751
simply because of you.

00:38:08,153 --> 00:38:09,487
What I think you need
is you need

00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:12,190
somebody with the experience
that's gonna help you.

00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,458
And look --
there are sharks here

00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:17,095
that have better experience
in this area than I do.

00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:18,163
I'm out.

00:38:18,163 --> 00:38:20,131
Understood.

00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,132
Daymond.

00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,134
Fashion.

00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,336
I'm a little -- yeah, I'm-a get
a little nervous, 'cause --

00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:27,672
GREINER: Yeah. Daymond,
this is right up your alley.

00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,507
Maybe he's being quiet
'cause he doesn't like it.

00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:31,509
Maybe he's being quiet
'cause he's taking it all in.

00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:33,545
I'm -- I'm just thinking,
you know?

00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:35,380
GREINER:
He's processing.

00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,349
Okay.
I'm going to...

00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:56,334
NARRATOR:
Two sharks are out.

00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:59,270
Tim has three more chances
to make a deal.

00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,105
HERJAVEC:
Daymond. Fashion guru.

00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:03,575
I'm a little -- yeah, I'm-a get
a little nervous, 'cause --

00:39:03,575 --> 00:39:06,377
yeah. Daymond,
this is right up your alley.

00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:08,413
Okay.
I'm going to...

00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:13,451
T-the real challenge
I have is

00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:16,321
I'm a partner in a company
called snkrbst,

00:39:16,321 --> 00:39:18,122
and I just --
I'm a partner,

00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:21,559
and we just bought the --
the old shoe company etonic,

00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:22,994
all right?
so you're conflicted?

00:39:24,062 --> 00:39:26,631
So, I'm sitting here,
thinking,

00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:29,067
do I dump the guys
I just acquired or not?

00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:32,303
But it, ethically,
would be wrong, and so I --

00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:33,805
when has that ever
stopped you before?

00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:35,173
[ laughter ]

00:39:35,173 --> 00:39:36,975
It's a conflict...

00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:39,544
So, regretfully,
I'm out.

00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,047
I appreciate that.
You know, I understand.

00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,650
You know, business is --
you know, you want --

00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:48,786
I want partners that would
speak up and say that, you know?

00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:50,188
And, you know,
that's how we are.

00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:51,990
We're -- we're straightforward
with everybody.

00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:54,726
That's how I like to run
my business. I don't...

00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:58,730
Tim, you got two guys left.
You got Mark, and you got Kevin.

00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:01,499
What can I say to you guys

00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:04,369
that you haven't heard that --
that would tip this for you?

00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:05,870
That's up for you
to decide.

00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:08,039
I'm not a guy
that's gonna quit on you.

00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:09,974
I'm a guy
that's gonna, you know,

00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:11,509
work my fingers to the bone.

00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:12,543
This is how I do.

00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:14,279
I GET UP AT 3:00
in the morning.

00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:16,915
I'm on the phone with
my distributors over in Europe.

00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,283
I'm on the phone with Asia.

00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:20,218
My job here
is not to fight for you,

00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:22,053
but they wanted to know
my opinion.

00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:23,221
You're the real deal.

00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:25,556
You're the real deal,
and this is a real company,

00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:26,724
and that's why
I was conflicted.

00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:28,159
So you don't have to
speak for yourself.

00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,961
I'm gonna tell both of them --
this guy's the real deal.

00:40:29,961 --> 00:40:31,663
Wow. That's quite
an endorsement.
I appreciate that.

00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:32,697
I appreciate that.

00:40:32,697 --> 00:40:34,599
That's quite an endorsement,
Daymond.

00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,100
I'm just --
but you know
what I say --

00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,568
never take advice
from someone

00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:39,037
who doesn't have to live
with the consequences.

00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:40,038
That is true.

00:40:40,038 --> 00:40:41,105
[ laughs ]

00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,774
He's not putting up
any money.

00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:45,243
Um, I don't know what
this company's worth right now.

00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:46,611
I like it, but I don't know
what it's worth.

00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:47,712
Make an offer.

00:40:47,712 --> 00:40:51,082
All right, I'll give you
$200,000 for 50%.

00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:55,019
First of all,
i-i appreciate

00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:56,988
the fact that there is an offer
on the table.

00:40:56,988 --> 00:40:57,989
Mm-hmm.

00:40:57,989 --> 00:40:59,958
Um...

00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,893
I really don't know
what it's worth.

00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:05,096
It's -- it's a shot
with you rebirthing an idea

00:41:05,096 --> 00:41:06,731
that was proven
in a foreign market.

00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:08,099
That's the way
I look at it.

00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:11,502
Mark?

00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,439
HERJAVEC:
$200,000, 50%,

00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:16,641
and you got Mark over there
really quiet.

00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:19,310
I want to hear
what you say to him.

00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,879
I'm --
I'm processing it as --

00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:23,881
it shouldn't be
a process, right?

00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:25,650
You already know
the answer.

00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:29,053
I-i think it's a bit rich.

00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:31,222
Well, come back
with something.

00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:34,792
Counter.

00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:38,262
I would be willing
to go up to...35%.

00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:40,098
I'll do that deal.

00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:44,535
Want to do that deal?

00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:47,805
Let's do it.

00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:49,574
[ Greiner laughs ]

00:41:49,574 --> 00:41:51,876
See, I like when I let him
negotiate for me. [ laughs ]
Congrats, Mark.

00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:53,611
All right.
Thank you, baby.

00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:55,480
Congratulations.
I really like it.

00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,282
The first thing we'll do
is we'll get it as a mass
premium and as a giveaway.

00:41:58,282 --> 00:42:00,985
I'll give them to all
the guys to start
wearing it, handing out.

00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:03,721
We'll put them in the mav shop,
and we'll get that rolling.

00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:05,023
TALLEY:
Awesome. Thank you.
Great job, Tim.

00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,391
GREINER: Great job.

00:42:06,391 --> 00:42:07,492
You did great.

00:42:07,492 --> 00:42:08,526
Thank you, guys.

00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:11,929
A deal with Mark
is totally amazing.

00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:14,699
He's connected to sports,
he's connected to licensing,

00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:17,068
so these are things
that could make our brand huge,

00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:19,737
so it's just --
just an awesome feeling.

00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:20,738
You didn't like it,
eh?

00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:21,906
I loved it.
It's a conflict.

00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:23,541
I own a company
like this.

00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,876
Mark, good one.
Ba-bam!

00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:27,612
Ba-bam!
