Just cream cheese
and the mango mango, that's it.

00:06:55,477 --> 00:06:56,945
for this next coming year?

00:06:56,945 --> 00:06:58,513
$291,000.

00:06:58,513 --> 00:07:00,115
Are you selling it in
any of the military?
(Lakesha) Yes.

00:07:00,115 --> 00:07:01,750
We're actually getting ready
to go into

00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,186
the military commissaries.
(Robert) How big an order
would that be?

00:07:04,186 --> 00:07:05,287
Uh, huge. We're--
Uh, that--

00:07:05,287 --> 00:07:07,122
So would you go into
all of their stores?

00:07:07,122 --> 00:07:09,358
'cause that's a big business.
We will. We will go into
all their stores.

00:07:09,358 --> 00:07:10,592
Actually--
(chuckles)
He's eating mine now.

00:07:10,592 --> 00:07:11,893
(mark) Robert,
pass that down.

00:07:11,893 --> 00:07:13,495
(laughter)
That could be
a very big market.

00:07:13,495 --> 00:07:15,764
Pass the cream cheese down,
Robert. Pass the cream cheese.

00:07:15,764 --> 00:07:17,199
(speaks indistinctly)
Oh, my God.

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,968
Guys, you--You can't make any
money with this model.

00:07:19,968 --> 00:07:23,171
Because you can't bring
a distributor into your model.

00:07:23,171 --> 00:07:25,073
When you get bigger,
and all of a sudden

00:07:25,073 --> 00:07:26,608
you've got a thousand stores,

00:07:26,608 --> 00:07:28,677
the problem is
you can't make any money

00:07:28,677 --> 00:07:30,212
'cause you've got to give
a distributor a dollar

00:07:30,212 --> 00:07:31,546
on each one.

00:07:31,546 --> 00:07:34,049
(mark) What comes after
mangoes?
It's all mango.

00:07:34,049 --> 00:07:36,885
It's gonna be mango vinaigrette,
we're gonna--
Why aren't you going
into mango chutney?

00:07:36,885 --> 00:07:38,553
It's a bigger category
than all of this.

00:07:38,553 --> 00:07:40,522
Because you can use
our preserve...
(all) to make a chutney.

00:07:40,522 --> 00:07:42,791
Man, you guys know
your mangoes.
(Lakesha) We--

00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:45,260
Yes, from sweet to savory
to spicy.

00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,029
(Kevin) You want to provide
the base.
And you need your product

00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:48,430
to make all those
delicious recipes.
(Lakesha) That's right.

00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,532
Right, right, right.

00:07:50,532 --> 00:07:52,100
This stuff is...
Pretty damn good.
(Robert) Just keep talking.

00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,368
I'm taking bets to see
if I can finish it

00:07:53,368 --> 00:07:54,403
by the time you all
are done.
Yes.

00:07:54,403 --> 00:07:55,904
(women laugh)

00:07:55,904 --> 00:07:58,307
Lakesha, I'm not here.
Just ignore me.
Okay. Okay.

00:07:58,307 --> 00:08:01,043
You know, I just have to say
it's a huge testament

00:08:01,043 --> 00:08:03,145
because the two sharks
that right now

00:08:03,145 --> 00:08:05,380
are watching their weight,
not eating a lot of carbs,

00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,317
are Mark and Robert.
(mark) It's cream cheese.
(speaks indistinctly)

00:08:08,317 --> 00:08:11,453
I used to watch my weight.
That cream cheese can make you
a lot of money.

00:08:11,453 --> 00:08:13,355
(Robert) Lakesha, what's your
biggest challenge so far

00:08:13,355 --> 00:08:14,723
with the business?

00:08:14,723 --> 00:08:16,725
Because it sounds like
you're having a lot of success.

00:08:16,725 --> 00:08:19,494
The challenge is production,
keeping up with demand--

00:08:19,494 --> 00:08:21,296
Being on someone else's
schedule.

00:08:21,296 --> 00:08:23,031
You can't get that money
anywhere else?

00:08:23,031 --> 00:08:25,534
We--We could get the money
somewhere else.
We--we could.

00:08:25,534 --> 00:08:27,135
But we would like to...
party with Sharks.

00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,137
Yeah, we would like to party
with the--with the sharks.

00:08:29,137 --> 00:08:30,372
We don't want you all to--
Hey, there's nothing like
a shark party.

00:08:30,372 --> 00:08:32,240
(laughs)

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,209
(laughs) We want the party.
Yeah, we don't want you all
to do all the work.

00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:36,578
We want to do the work.
We know the mango.

00:08:36,578 --> 00:08:38,046
Guys, I have no doubt
in my mind

00:08:38,046 --> 00:08:40,115
you are gonna be the world's
first mango millionaires.

00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:45,220
But I don't know a chutney
from a shputney

00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,889
from a potato.
But you know money.

00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:51,026
I know money,
but it's just not my thing.

00:08:51,026 --> 00:08:53,462
So for that reason,
I'm out.

00:08:55,797 --> 00:08:57,099
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:08:57,099 --> 00:08:58,467
Keep on jammin'.

00:08:58,467 --> 00:09:00,602
(all, singsongy) Spread it,
mix it, shake it, stir it.

00:09:00,602 --> 00:09:02,771
Spread it, mix it,
shake it, stir it.
I love you guys. (chuckles)

00:09:02,771 --> 00:09:05,240
You know, you've created
a hobby here.

00:09:07,242 --> 00:09:08,910
That's what it is.
It's not a business yet.

00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,813
You are going to find out
the hard way

00:09:11,813 --> 00:09:15,217
unless you take out 75 cents
out of your cost,

00:09:15,217 --> 00:09:16,251
you're going to zero.

00:09:18,387 --> 00:09:19,821
There's a lot of mistakes
in what you're doing.

00:09:19,821 --> 00:09:21,523
I actually don't want
to educate you on this

00:09:21,523 --> 00:09:23,558
'cause it's not
the "advice" tank.

00:09:23,558 --> 00:09:26,428
Sorry to give you
the bad news, but I'm out.

00:09:29,131 --> 00:09:30,699
You guys are great.
Thank you.

00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:33,568
Thank you.
And I don't like mango.

00:09:33,568 --> 00:09:39,341
But I loved everything
that was on my plate.

00:09:40,976 --> 00:09:42,277
And you saw what Robert
did with it.

00:09:42,277 --> 00:09:44,246
I rarely say this.

00:09:44,246 --> 00:09:46,982
I don't think it's good
for you to actually give away

00:09:46,982 --> 00:09:49,851
equity to a shark,
and I'll tell you why.

00:09:49,851 --> 00:09:51,953
I think you should
fund yourselves

00:09:51,953 --> 00:09:55,023
with the money that comes in
and retain your equity.

00:09:55,023 --> 00:09:57,492
And because that's
my very best advice,

00:09:57,492 --> 00:09:58,794
I'm going to go out,

00:09:58,794 --> 00:10:01,029
but I hope that
that's what you do

00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:03,632
because I see huge success
for you.

00:10:03,632 --> 00:10:04,699
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

00:10:04,699 --> 00:10:06,001
Thank you so much.

00:10:06,001 --> 00:10:07,903
(Daymond) We tend not to want
to give our counterparts

00:10:07,903 --> 00:10:11,506

fascinating that

00:10:11,506 --> 00:10:13,909

Had a jelly and jam business

00:10:13,909 --> 00:10:15,610

very valuable questions.

I don't think I can be of
service with you in this area.

00:10:26,455 --> 00:10:27,456
I'm out.

I hated the food.

00:14:01,885 --> 00:14:03,854
So we basically launched
in March

00:14:03,854 --> 00:14:05,322
via an indiegogo campaign.

00:14:05,322 --> 00:14:07,390
We sold 4,000 units
within 30 days.

00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,426
We generated $140,000
in revenue.

00:14:09,426 --> 00:14:12,829
Indiegogo is
a crowdfunding site. Right.
It's just like kickstarter,
correct.

00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:14,998
What do you sell them for,
Charles?
$49.99.

00:14:14,998 --> 00:14:16,433
Could we see it?
Could we see it?
Yes.

00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:18,969
(chuckles)
I thought that one of
the biggest issues

00:14:18,969 --> 00:14:20,103
around these things--

00:14:20,103 --> 00:14:21,905
When the first handheld units
came out--

00:14:21,905 --> 00:14:24,074
was that you get arrested--
Or worse,

00:14:24,074 --> 00:14:26,843
you harm somebody
because you're drunk--

00:14:26,843 --> 00:14:29,379
And you relied on the device
to make your decision.

00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:31,715
Isn't that a huge liability
to you?

00:14:31,715 --> 00:14:34,584
First and foremost, there's no
replacement for good judgment.

00:14:34,584 --> 00:14:36,987
And so the Breathometer device
basically promotes,

00:14:36,987 --> 00:14:38,955
uh, making smarter
and safer decisions.

00:14:38,955 --> 00:14:40,524
We provide
the instruction manual.

00:14:40,524 --> 00:14:43,226
We clearly label disclaimers
throughout the app.

00:14:43,226 --> 00:14:45,729
And as long as we do our part
and the due diligence

00:14:45,729 --> 00:14:47,898
and we uphold our side,
we're in the clear.

00:14:47,898 --> 00:14:49,900
Should I come up
and try this with you?

00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,502
Uh, sure.
Feel free to come up.
Okay.

00:14:52,502 --> 00:14:54,704
(Kevin)
And if she doesn't pass...
if I can't walk--

00:14:54,704 --> 00:14:56,173
Hey, if she can
walk in those heels,

00:14:56,173 --> 00:14:58,141
you already
have your answer.
So...

00:14:58,141 --> 00:14:59,276
basically go ahead
and plug it

00:14:59,276 --> 00:15:00,777
into the audio jack
of your smartphone.

00:15:00,777 --> 00:15:04,814
Um, all you need to do--
Do is hit the start button.
Okay.

00:15:04,814 --> 00:15:06,483
Go ahead and breathe
into this hole--

00:15:06,483 --> 00:15:07,517
right there.

00:15:07,517 --> 00:15:11,454
A little closer.
(blows air)

00:15:11,454 --> 00:15:13,890
(chuckles)
You're at a .04 right now.

00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,926
That would be legal.
Yeah, you're legal.

00:15:15,926 --> 00:15:17,894
Does it tell you
if she has bad breath, too?
(Lori chuckles)

00:15:17,894 --> 00:15:19,429
Uh, it's funny
as you mention that,

00:15:19,429 --> 00:15:22,098
uh, there's an al-also another
sensor we're looking into.

00:15:22,098 --> 00:15:23,366
It's for halitosis.
Oh, seriously?

00:15:23,366 --> 00:15:24,901
And through--and seriously.

00:15:24,901 --> 00:15:26,036
I'm starting to think of this

00:15:26,036 --> 00:15:27,571
as more of a multifunction
breathalyzer.

00:15:27,571 --> 00:15:29,739
So the next one we're
actually trying to focus on

00:15:29,739 --> 00:15:31,675
is, uh, diabetes.

00:15:31,675 --> 00:15:32,709
It's in clinical trials.

00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:34,311
And it's obviously less
intrusive

00:15:34,311 --> 00:15:36,780
than blood pricking, right?
Charles, how did you
develop it?

00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,049
Are you a software guy?
Are you a hardware design guy?

00:15:39,049 --> 00:15:40,584
So I used to code
back in the day.

00:15:40,584 --> 00:15:42,619
I built and sold my last company
within 18 months.

00:15:42,619 --> 00:15:44,854
So, essentially, I went straight
into developing Breathometer

00:15:44,854 --> 00:15:47,390
as soon as I exited
my last company.

00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,593
If you sold your last business,
and you did very Well,

00:15:49,593 --> 00:15:51,061
why didn't you take
some of that money

00:15:51,061 --> 00:15:52,529
and invest it in this?

00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:55,532
I have. Uh, so I started off
with the first initial $50,000.

00:15:55,532 --> 00:15:57,000
I've already raised
half a million dollars

00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,568
in total from angels.

00:15:58,568 --> 00:16:00,470
What are you gonna use
the money for?

00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,372
Uh, strictly, uh,
manufacturing of the product.

00:16:02,372 --> 00:16:05,208
Well, the good news for you
is that both in Europe

00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,744
and Canada, Mexico, U.S.,
we're going to almost

00:16:07,744 --> 00:16:09,946
a zero tolerance
on alcohol and driving.

00:16:09,946 --> 00:16:11,114
Correct.

00:16:11,114 --> 00:16:12,449
That's the trend.
I'm sure you've heard about

00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:14,084
the federal safety board
in the United States

00:16:14,084 --> 00:16:15,518
that's trying to push down--
They just lowered it.

00:16:15,518 --> 00:16:18,054
From .08 to .05.
I'm--I'm a big fan
of the sensor business.

00:16:18,054 --> 00:16:19,289
I've got a company--
Motionloft.

00:16:19,289 --> 00:16:20,457
We're all about sensors.
(mouths words)

00:16:20,457 --> 00:16:22,626
You know, I think that's
the future of technology.

00:16:22,626 --> 00:16:24,661
Okay, I'm gonna make--
I'm gonna make you an offer.

00:16:26,997 --> 00:16:30,066
All right. What I'd like to do
is offer you $500,000

00:16:30,066 --> 00:16:31,201
for 20% of the company.

00:16:33,136 --> 00:16:34,237
That's my offer.
Okay.

00:16:34,237 --> 00:16:36,006
I'll give you a chance
to talk to other people

00:16:36,006 --> 00:16:38,108

Any other sharks? (laughs)

00:16:38,108 --> 00:16:41,645

go in with you...
no.

00:16:41,645 --> 00:16:43,346

(chuckles)

00:16:43,346 --> 00:16:45,315
No. This is not-- I'm not
worried about the retail.

00:16:45,315 --> 00:16:48,652
That's just, like, a smidgen
versus the long-Term benefit.

00:16:50,253 --> 00:16:54,124
I'll give you $250,000 for 15%.

00:16:54,124 --> 00:16:56,393
And you wouldn't have
to lose that much equity then.
That's not bad. Okay.

00:16:56,393 --> 00:16:58,728
It's much less diluted
than Mark's 20%.

00:16:58,728 --> 00:17:00,096
Okay.

00:17:00,096 --> 00:17:01,531

00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,334

the "Funding channel"

within the next 60 days

is to close a full

from the angels
back in silicon valley.

00:17:12,442 --> 00:17:14,477

00:17:16,713 --> 00:17:18,315

00:21:20,095 --> 00:21:22,464

a million dollars,

of the company.

00:21:27,068 --> 00:21:28,803

get your thoughts.

00:21:28,803 --> 00:21:31,373
You know, a million for 30--
Um, 30%,

00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,643
you know, that's
a $3.3 million valuation.

00:21:34,643 --> 00:21:37,312
It's not a huge valuation.
Sure.

00:21:37,312 --> 00:21:40,015

I'm a little bit worried about

00:21:40,015 --> 00:21:41,550

00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:45,086

big egos, um, and so,

Yeah, you're right.

Retail is $5.

00:27:43,617 --> 00:27:46,920
My cost is 65 cents
for that whole package.

00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,355
We wholesale 'em
for $2.50,

00:27:48,355 --> 00:27:50,657
which gives them a price point
for retail stores

00:27:50,657 --> 00:27:52,058
anywhere between $5 and $6.

00:27:52,058 --> 00:27:55,095
Have you done, Like, uh,
any type of trade show,

00:27:55,095 --> 00:27:56,663

(chuckles) Trade shows?

00:27:56,663 --> 00:27:59,966
That's the next step for me.
So go do a show
and see first,

00:27:59,966 --> 00:28:01,801
is this something that's viable?

00:28:01,801 --> 00:28:05,372
And then think about whether
or not you need an investment.

00:28:05,372 --> 00:28:09,009

a full financial ex--

00:28:14,848 --> 00:28:16,750

really here...

00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,818
we're talking about
$10,000 for 10%--

00:28:18,818 --> 00:28:21,321
a punitive value of $100,000.
Correct.

00:28:21,321 --> 00:28:23,023

00:28:26,626 --> 00:28:29,663

I-I mean...
(laughter continues)

00:28:30,931 --> 00:28:32,132
You know, there's two things,
though, Kevin,

00:28:32,132 --> 00:28:34,301

00:28:51,518 --> 00:28:53,887
I think you did
a great presentation today.

00:28:53,887 --> 00:28:57,023
But as far as the medals
are concerned, I'm out.

00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,762
If I'd have come to you
35 years ago

00:29:02,762 --> 00:29:04,130
with a rock in a box
and said,

00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:05,999
"I'm gonna sell
a million of these,"

00:29:05,999 --> 00:29:08,335
you would have laughed at me.
That was before the internet

00:29:08,335 --> 00:29:09,970
and before social media.

00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:13,173
So with an item like this
that people are talking about--

00:29:13,173 --> 00:29:14,374
and I know
it's in small quantities,

00:29:14,374 --> 00:29:15,675
but I'm still getting
responses from people

00:29:15,675 --> 00:29:18,545
from around the world--
but it's not a business.

00:29:18,545 --> 00:29:20,847
I--all due respect,
I beg to disag--beg to--

00:29:20,847 --> 00:29:23,483
I beg--
Oh, yeah, because
those $2,500 in Sales

00:29:23,483 --> 00:29:24,651
really begs to differ.

00:29:25,785 --> 00:29:27,854
Uh, again, this is something
that we're in the ground floor.

00:29:27,854 --> 00:29:29,956
(laughter)
And you know what?
The problem is--The problem is

00:29:29,956 --> 00:29:31,424
you're in the ground floor--
You're not in the ground floor,

00:29:31,424 --> 00:29:34,828
and you're gonna stay
in the ground floor.
You're in the basement.

00:29:34,828 --> 00:29:35,829
I'm out.

00:29:39,232 --> 00:29:40,900
I forbid you to proceed.

00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,969
I'm out.

00:29:42,969 --> 00:29:44,170
Thank you.

00:29:47,307 --> 00:29:49,442
Daymond?

00:29:49,442 --> 00:29:52,412
I don't--I don't think
the $2,500 is a big problem.

00:29:54,848 --> 00:29:57,417
I stood on a corner
and sold hats the first day

00:29:57,417 --> 00:30:00,286
that I made with my hands,
and I made $800. That's it.

00:30:00,286 --> 00:30:03,123
It takes as much energy to--
To dream small

00:30:03,123 --> 00:30:05,392
as it does to dream big.
So...

00:30:05,392 --> 00:30:07,927
but I didn't ask for
anybody's help at that point.

00:30:09,295 --> 00:30:11,431
It's gimmicky. It just
isn't for me. I'm out.

00:30:14,367 --> 00:30:16,503
Thank you, sharks.
Good luck, Jim.

00:30:16,503 --> 00:30:17,570
Thank you.
Good luck.

00:30:18,705 --> 00:30:20,840
That's the first...
that was the...

00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,177
that was the funniest pitch.
Beefcake-y guy that's
come into the tank.

00:30:24,177 --> 00:30:26,179
Barbara would have gone
bonkers.

00:30:32,185 --> 00:30:36,322
♪♪

00:30:36,322 --> 00:30:38,558
Next into the tank
is an entrepreneur

00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:42,562
from New York City with
fashion forward accessories.

00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:45,465
Oh, that's a real dog.

00:30:48,935 --> 00:30:50,470
He looks scared.

00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:51,805
No, he's fine.

00:30:51,805 --> 00:30:53,773
(laughter)

00:30:53,773 --> 00:30:54,808
He's so cute.

00:30:54,808 --> 00:30:55,875
Hello, sharks.

00:30:55,875 --> 00:30:58,278
This cute little guy
here with me

00:30:58,278 --> 00:31:02,315
is my dog Kane,
and I am Amber Lee Forrester,

00:31:02,315 --> 00:31:05,385
the founder and president
of Kane &amp; Couture.

00:31:05,385 --> 00:31:08,888
I am seeking
a $150,000 investment

00:31:08,888 --> 00:31:11,858
for a 33% stake in my company.

00:31:11,858 --> 00:31:15,361
Kane &amp; Couture is
a canine lifestyle brand...

00:31:15,361 --> 00:31:18,598
offering fashionable,
functional collars,

00:31:18,598 --> 00:31:23,169
harnesses, leashes, carriers,
apparel, and useful accessories.

00:31:23,169 --> 00:31:26,973
Puts the style in you
and your doggy's lifestyles.

00:31:26,973 --> 00:31:29,209
(chuckles)
When I started Kane &amp; Couture,

00:31:29,209 --> 00:31:31,544
I found that most of the items
on the market

00:31:31,544 --> 00:31:33,680
were plaid, plain,
or suburban.

00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,749
Most of the unique items
were grossly overpriced

00:31:36,749 --> 00:31:39,085
and hard to find.
Kane and Couture...
(snoring)

00:31:39,085 --> 00:31:40,520
(laughter)
(Robert) Aw.

00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,955
Isn't that cute?
He fell asleep.
You're Boring him, Amber.

00:31:41,955 --> 00:31:43,323
You're Boring him.
Am I b--

00:31:43,323 --> 00:31:44,958
Oh, I don't want him
to fall asleep.
That's how--

00:31:44,958 --> 00:31:47,160
That's how comfortable he is.
(laughs)

00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,495
Under the Kane &amp; Couture
umbrella,

00:31:48,495 --> 00:31:50,763
we have
our signature premium line

00:31:50,763 --> 00:31:53,766
as well as our
value driven lines--

00:31:53,766 --> 00:31:56,536
The Bubba dog collection
and imperial pup.

00:31:56,536 --> 00:31:59,439
But, sharks, I'd rather
show you than tell you.

00:31:59,439 --> 00:32:01,274
Meet Dina and Henry.

00:32:01,274 --> 00:32:05,278
Henry is ready for
his day out on the town.
Aww...

00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:07,981
look at--
(Lori) Aw.

00:32:07,981 --> 00:32:10,350
(chuckles)
He's outfitted in our
boyfriend button-down shirt

00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:12,085
and our easy and convenient

00:32:12,085 --> 00:32:15,021
step-In one-piece
harness and Leash.

00:32:15,021 --> 00:32:16,923
Henry is so embarrassed
right now.
He does. He looks very cute.

00:32:16,923 --> 00:32:18,224
(chuckles)
Yeah.

00:32:18,224 --> 00:32:22,195
And next, we have
Courtney and Solstice.
Oh, wow.

00:32:22,195 --> 00:32:24,397
Solstice can get in touch
with her feminine side...

00:32:24,397 --> 00:32:27,233
(kisses)
in our remi pink collar
and matching leash.

00:32:27,233 --> 00:32:30,136
And Mr. Casey Kane
loves to travel in style.

00:32:30,136 --> 00:32:32,071
He is riding in
one of our signature

00:32:32,071 --> 00:32:34,474
Kane &amp; Couture carriers.

00:32:34,474 --> 00:32:37,777
They are designed
to look like purses.

00:32:37,777 --> 00:32:39,913
But they're actually suited

00:32:39,913 --> 00:32:42,382
for the comfortable travel
of your pet.
(laughter)

00:32:42,382 --> 00:32:44,150
(Lori) Aw.
I really need
an amazing partner

00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:46,352
to help me take this
to the next level.

00:32:46,352 --> 00:32:48,254
So, sharks,
I'd like to discuss

00:32:48,254 --> 00:32:50,890
how we can take a bite
into this industry together.

00:32:52,525 --> 00:32:54,494
Can I see Kane?
Yeah.

00:32:54,494 --> 00:32:55,728
Amber, you wouldn't really
take him out in public

00:32:55,728 --> 00:32:57,330
like that, would you?
(Lori) Aw, he's so cute.

00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:59,065
(high-pitched Voice) Hi, baby.
He--This is for
special occasions.

00:32:59,065 --> 00:33:00,333
(Robert kisses
and Imitates dog whimpers)
if he's going to a wedding,

00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:02,502
people love to take
their dogs places,

00:33:02,502 --> 00:33:03,903
and they want
to dress them up.

00:33:03,903 --> 00:33:07,040
(Kevin) Amber, how often does
Kane get invited to a wedding?

00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,242
Every day.
Well, I mean,
I have had one

00:33:09,242 --> 00:33:10,877
that he's come to
and worn a tuxedo. (chuckles)

00:33:10,877 --> 00:33:13,213
and...
I have to come look.

00:33:13,213 --> 00:33:14,681
(Robert laughs)
Amber, look,
before we get started,

00:33:14,681 --> 00:33:16,683
can I ask you
a practical question?

00:33:16,683 --> 00:33:19,886
Sure.
When you carry a small dog
around in a bag

00:33:19,886 --> 00:33:21,688
for extended periods of time,

00:33:21,688 --> 00:33:24,023
what happens if the dog
has to pee-pee or poo-poo?

00:33:24,023 --> 00:33:25,825
(chuckles)
(chuckles)

00:33:25,825 --> 00:33:28,027
Then you let him out the bag
so he can pee-pee or poo-poo.

00:33:28,027 --> 00:33:29,762
Well, does he tell you?

00:33:29,762 --> 00:33:32,065
Does he tell you that
that's what he's planning?
Well, you know your dog.

00:33:32,065 --> 00:33:33,933
And so you'll know his
pee-pee and poo-poo pattern.

00:33:33,933 --> 00:33:36,269
Kevin, do you never--
Have ever had a pet?
(Kevin) Has---has--

00:33:36,269 --> 00:33:38,671
Has Kane ever pee-peed
in a bag?
So he's 6 years old.

00:33:38,671 --> 00:33:40,173
He's been trained.
America wants to know

00:33:40,173 --> 00:33:42,642
what happens
when he's in the bag.
Oh, my.

00:33:42,642 --> 00:33:44,010
So Kane is 6 years old.
Yeah.

00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:45,878
He's been traveling
since he was 8 weeks old.

00:33:45,878 --> 00:33:47,914
That's a 50-year-old dog
in dog years.

00:33:47,914 --> 00:33:49,649
Uh, Yeah, yeah,
I mean, well--

00:33:49,649 --> 00:33:51,084
and usually when you turn 50
you have to go more often.
You gotta go.

00:33:51,084 --> 00:33:52,819
You get a little incontinent.
(laughs)

00:33:52,819 --> 00:33:55,421
So I was just wondering...
so maybe my next invention
should be, like,

00:33:55,421 --> 00:33:57,457
some doggy diaper
that's cute?

00:33:57,457 --> 00:33:59,392
Well, no, we've seen that
already, thank you.
(laughs)

00:33:59,392 --> 00:34:01,828
(Robert) Amber,
do you have sales?

00:34:01,828 --> 00:34:04,797
My sales in the last year
were just about $90,000.

00:34:06,266 --> 00:34:07,533
And how do you sell?

00:34:07,533 --> 00:34:09,435
Through what? Retail?
Online?

00:34:09,435 --> 00:34:12,639
Yes, so I sell through
retail and online.

00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,307
(Daymond)
What are the major retailers?

00:34:14,307 --> 00:34:17,577
Macy's carries my products
on a seasonal, um--
Really? Macy's?

00:34:17,577 --> 00:34:20,179
Amber, what will
your sales be next year?

00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:23,483
My projection in the next year
is $1.8 million.

00:34:23,483 --> 00:34:26,286
From $90,000 to $1.8 million?
You're gonna get from--Huh?

00:34:29,088 --> 00:34:31,457
Well, I have people
who are ready to order

00:34:31,457 --> 00:34:32,892
starting the holiday
this year.

00:34:32,892 --> 00:34:34,427
So I'm ready to get
very aggressive.

00:34:34,427 --> 00:34:36,095
Wh--Amber, what does that mean,
"They're ready to order"?

00:34:36,095 --> 00:34:38,498
I'm putting together
the packages that they like

00:34:38,498 --> 00:34:39,932
in order to present them
to them.

00:34:39,932 --> 00:34:42,068
Unfortunately, with coming here,
I wasn't able to do so before.

00:34:42,068 --> 00:34:43,803
(Lori) So prices for
these things--

00:34:43,803 --> 00:34:45,905
Like, I had picked up
this really cute collar.
Mm-hmm.

00:34:45,905 --> 00:34:48,174
And it says, "Sparked."
Yes.

00:34:48,174 --> 00:34:50,043
So what would this cost
you to make,

00:34:50,043 --> 00:34:52,445
and then what do you sell it
to the retailer for,

00:34:52,445 --> 00:34:53,880
and what do they sell it for?

00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,849
Uh, about $3.
Right, and what are they
selling it for?

00:34:56,849 --> 00:34:59,018
They're selling them from
anywhere from $20 to $24.

00:34:59,018 --> 00:35:01,788
What's the difference
between your stuff

00:35:01,788 --> 00:35:04,157
and the millions
of other products

00:35:04,157 --> 00:35:06,326
that are out there like it?
Wait, let me answer.
Nothing.

00:35:06,326 --> 00:35:08,761
No, that's not True,
actually.
Well, what is it?

00:35:08,761 --> 00:35:10,263
So the difference is
it's a brand.

00:35:10,263 --> 00:35:11,631
You also have--
but I don't know
the Kane &amp; Couture brand.

00:35:11,631 --> 00:35:14,801
Not at $90,000 a year in sales.
You have no brand.

00:35:17,203 --> 00:35:19,906
Well, people are learning
our brand.

00:35:19,906 --> 00:35:23,142
And I kind of feel like
I'm, like, the fubu for dogs.

00:35:23,142 --> 00:35:25,144
Like... (chuckles)
(chuckles)

00:35:25,144 --> 00:35:26,879
(laughter)
Great.

00:35:26,879 --> 00:35:29,148
I'm okay with that.
It's true. There wasn't
a lot of really, like,

00:35:29,148 --> 00:35:31,084
like, there was--It was
plaid, plain, or suburban.

00:35:31,084 --> 00:35:33,019
I really mean that.
There weren't like, like,

00:35:33,019 --> 00:35:35,355
how we have our
boyfriend button-downs and--

00:35:35,355 --> 00:35:38,524
Boyfriend button-down for a dog.

00:35:38,524 --> 00:35:40,326
Yes.
That dog has a bow tie on.

00:35:40,326 --> 00:35:42,895
Yes.
That's insane.

00:35:42,895 --> 00:35:45,164
It's not to everyone,
just maybe to you.
It's crazy.

00:35:45,164 --> 00:35:46,966
Do you have a dog?
No, thank goodness.

00:35:46,966 --> 00:35:49,635
Amber, are you kidding?
I have children.
I don't need a dog.

00:35:49,635 --> 00:35:51,304
(chuckles) Oh...
that is ridiculous.

00:35:51,304 --> 00:35:53,539
How many years did you say
you've been in business?

00:35:53,539 --> 00:35:55,842
So I've been in business
about four and a half years.

00:35:55,842 --> 00:35:58,578
I've been full time with it
for three years.

00:35:58,578 --> 00:36:01,514
Within that time,
I've gone to some classes.

00:36:01,514 --> 00:36:03,783
I've also had a baby
and got married.

00:36:03,783 --> 00:36:06,285
So it's been a full
four and a half years.

00:36:06,285 --> 00:36:07,987
Sorry, Amber, maybe I missed
how you're going to go

00:36:07,987 --> 00:36:10,423
from $90,000 to $1.8 million...
$1.8--

00:36:10,423 --> 00:36:11,958
in one year.
Let me tell you.

00:36:11,958 --> 00:36:14,127
'cause that would be
faster growth than Fubu.

00:36:14,127 --> 00:36:15,795
Uh, well, let me tell you.
Absolutely.

00:36:15,795 --> 00:36:18,731
And I-I even feel that that
could be somewhat conservative.

00:36:18,731 --> 00:36:23,002
(laughs)
Because I'm already in front
of seven major retailers

00:36:23,002 --> 00:36:24,437
who are ready to place orders.

00:36:24,437 --> 00:36:27,173
Even if I just started
in 10% of their stores,

00:36:27,173 --> 00:36:29,709
then I can get
to $1.8 million.

00:36:29,709 --> 00:36:32,111
These major retailers--
You have hard copy orders?

00:36:32,111 --> 00:36:34,714
I have--I will have
hard copy orders.

00:36:34,714 --> 00:36:36,315
I don't have hard copy
orders today. I--

00:36:36,315 --> 00:36:39,185
I'm in discussions with them.
And so...

00:36:39,185 --> 00:36:40,820
and So, as you know--
I'm sorry, Amber, I'm not sure
what that means.

00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,088
I-I've been in sales
for a long time.
Okay.

00:36:42,088 --> 00:36:44,056
I know there's a lot of talk
before Somebody actually

00:36:44,056 --> 00:36:46,325
gives you an order.
Yes.

00:36:46,325 --> 00:36:48,728
Just like my sales guys
always come back and tell me.
Well, I've had orders
from them before.

00:36:48,728 --> 00:36:50,296
It's not like I'm just saying
that I'm gonna get orders.

00:36:50,296 --> 00:36:52,598
But, Amber, they can buy
dog crap from anybody.

00:36:52,598 --> 00:36:54,033
(whimpers)

00:36:54,033 --> 00:36:56,736
Well, I don't have dog crap.
I have very nice dog items.

00:36:56,736 --> 00:36:58,337
I don't mean it in--
in a negative way.
Good for you.

00:36:58,337 --> 00:36:59,972
I don't mean it
in a negative way.
Kevin.

00:36:59,972 --> 00:37:01,974
You know what I mean.
You don't mean that
in a negative way?

00:37:01,974 --> 00:37:04,444
Why would they be different than
anybody else's dog tchotchkes?

00:37:04,444 --> 00:37:06,045
Well, why would your suit
be different from

00:37:06,045 --> 00:37:07,346
anybody Else's suit?
Yeah, but...

00:37:07,346 --> 00:37:10,550
name me one dog collar brand
outside of Kane &amp; Couture.

00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:13,486
Like, give me another
brand dog collar.
I would rather not.

00:37:13,486 --> 00:37:14,554
But there isn't one.

00:37:14,554 --> 00:37:16,823
Listen, I-I think--

00:37:16,823 --> 00:37:18,157
I think I'm coming down
with a fever

00:37:18,157 --> 00:37:21,227
'cause I just saw a dog
go by with a bow tie on.

00:37:21,227 --> 00:37:23,196
(laughter)

00:37:23,196 --> 00:37:25,832
I just--I'm sorry.
That gave you a fever?

00:37:25,832 --> 00:37:27,934
I don't get it,
and I hope I'm dreaming.

00:37:27,934 --> 00:37:29,635
But while I'm dreaming
in this nightmare,

00:37:29,635 --> 00:37:30,837
I'm out.

00:37:30,837 --> 00:37:33,739
Okay. Thank you.
Sorry, was he out?

00:37:33,739 --> 00:37:35,041
Yes, he's out. Yes.
(laughter)

00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:37,477
There it is again.
(laughs)

00:37:37,477 --> 00:37:41,747
I love the dog.
See, he's Loving Kane
in his tuxedo.

00:37:41,747 --> 00:37:43,649
Oh.
What would be
a sales projection

00:37:43,649 --> 00:37:44,951
that you would
actually expect

00:37:44,951 --> 00:37:47,487
for a company that's
at my level? Like, where--do--

00:37:47,487 --> 00:37:49,088
Amber, I didn't have
a problem with projections.

00:37:49,088 --> 00:37:50,389
I had a problem with
the way that you said

00:37:50,389 --> 00:37:51,724
You were going to do it.
Okay.

00:37:51,724 --> 00:37:55,027
For you to go from $90,000
to $1.8 million in 12 months

00:37:55,027 --> 00:37:57,363
would be... unbelievable.

00:37:57,363 --> 00:38:00,299
To go from where you are now
to that level of sales,

00:38:00,299 --> 00:38:02,401
I mean, that just, uh, it--

00:38:02,401 --> 00:38:05,137
It just lacks reality to me.

00:38:05,137 --> 00:38:06,439
For that reason, I'm out.

00:38:06,439 --> 00:38:08,975
(mark laughs)
Okay. Thank you.

00:38:08,975 --> 00:38:10,309
(whispers) Come here.

00:38:10,309 --> 00:38:12,879
That dog saw the bow tie
just now.
(laughter)

00:38:12,879 --> 00:38:14,947
So I'm gonna make you an offer.
Whoa.

00:38:14,947 --> 00:38:18,084
I think that this
can go somewhere. I really do.
But why? Why?

00:38:18,084 --> 00:38:21,220
Because people love their pets.
Bottom line. But...

00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:24,123
it's contingent on
Daymond going in with me.

00:38:26,292 --> 00:38:27,927
(sighs)

00:38:27,927 --> 00:38:31,230
I think that Daymond
can offer a lot

00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:36,369
on the fashion and--
and distribution end as well.

00:38:36,369 --> 00:38:38,437
I do, too.
So, Daymond...

00:38:38,437 --> 00:38:41,073
I think I would like
to make her an offer...
(laughs)

00:38:41,073 --> 00:38:45,645
$75,000/$75,000 for... 40%.
For what percentage?

00:38:45,645 --> 00:38:47,747
Daymond, I think that
we could do--

00:38:47,747 --> 00:38:50,283
Really help her to do
good things with this.

00:38:50,283 --> 00:38:53,352
I am stunned, and I am
going to forbid them to do that.

00:38:53,352 --> 00:38:55,154
You are being a hater
right now.

00:38:55,154 --> 00:38:57,056
So, Daymond, you haven't
said anything yet.

00:38:57,056 --> 00:38:58,867
Are you in with Lori?

00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,728
♪♪

00:39:08,768 --> 00:39:10,336
♪♪

00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:13,372
Two sharks are out.

00:39:13,372 --> 00:39:15,433
Lori is interested,

00:39:15,433 --> 00:39:18,002
but only if Daymond
will go in on her offer.

00:39:18,002 --> 00:39:20,438
So, Daymond, you haven't
said anything yet.

00:39:20,438 --> 00:39:21,639
Are you in with Lori?

00:39:23,408 --> 00:39:25,744
(Lori) What would she need
to do, Daymond,

00:39:25,744 --> 00:39:28,847
to make you feel that
this is appealing?
Well, you know...

00:39:28,847 --> 00:39:32,283
I really got scared
when she said, you know, 1.8,

00:39:32,283 --> 00:39:35,286
you know, $90,000 this year,
1.8 next year.

00:39:35,286 --> 00:39:36,855
(Robert)
That's where you lost me.

00:39:36,855 --> 00:39:38,189
I mean, it was
a great pitch until then.
Lori, you do understand

00:39:38,189 --> 00:39:40,792
that she did $90,000
last year, right?
She said--

00:39:40,792 --> 00:39:43,928
She's valuing the company at
about a half a million dollars.

00:39:43,928 --> 00:39:46,064
But a part of the reason
that I only did--
This is a massive undertaking.

00:39:46,064 --> 00:39:49,134
You understand that, right?
I do, except it can be simpler.

00:39:49,134 --> 00:39:52,237
Maybe we take and focus on
her top Sellers--

00:39:52,237 --> 00:39:54,339
We're gonna give her
$150,000 for that?

00:39:54,339 --> 00:39:58,376
She got into Macy's.
That's not easy. Right?
One store.

00:39:58,376 --> 00:40:00,378
It--It's a not easy
store to get into, though,

00:40:00,378 --> 00:40:01,613
and you know it.

00:40:06,017 --> 00:40:08,119
You have an offer.
Daymond has not spoken.

00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:11,689
Mark may up the bid.
We don't know.

00:40:11,689 --> 00:40:13,625
(laughter)

00:40:15,059 --> 00:40:16,561
Mark, over to you.

00:40:18,363 --> 00:40:20,832
I have no interest
in this business.

00:40:20,832 --> 00:40:22,000
I'm out.

00:40:25,103 --> 00:40:26,371
Okay, let--
Let me ask you something.

00:40:26,371 --> 00:40:29,207
I'm gonna try to make
a decision here.
Okay.

00:40:29,207 --> 00:40:30,742
So wh--
I just wanna make a point here,

00:40:30,742 --> 00:40:32,644
as a financial investor.
If you do this deal...

00:40:32,644 --> 00:40:34,512
(chuckles) You will make
hundreds of dollars.

00:40:34,512 --> 00:40:38,383
(laughter)
I've made more than hundreds
of dollars on my own.

00:40:38,383 --> 00:40:41,519
I'm sorry.
The dog has a bow tie on.
Even if you just made
$300,000,

00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:44,422
then you've already made back
the investment that you put in

00:40:44,422 --> 00:40:45,557
in the first year.
Okay, here you go.

00:40:45,557 --> 00:40:46,758
All right, I'll give you--

00:40:46,758 --> 00:40:48,927
Uh, but I'm gonna have
to give you a contingency.

00:40:48,927 --> 00:40:52,397
For you to do $1.8 million,

00:40:52,397 --> 00:40:56,267
how much do you think you need
to get in just opening orders?

00:40:56,267 --> 00:40:59,003
So then that number
would probably be around

00:40:59,003 --> 00:41:02,040
$400,000.
Okay.

00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,276
Okay, so I will go in
with Lori on that deal,

00:41:05,276 --> 00:41:08,146
half and half,
if you provide us with

00:41:08,146 --> 00:41:10,148
opening orders of $400,000.

00:41:12,584 --> 00:41:15,420
Okay.
For 40%.

00:41:17,589 --> 00:41:22,360
So would you consider
helping me with

00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,129
the financing of
the purchase orders

00:41:25,129 --> 00:41:27,432
for those? Because that's
also a large undertaking...

00:41:27,432 --> 00:41:29,400
Yes, I will. Yes.
For me.

00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,469
(Lori) Yes. I--
'cause it's a lot for me
to do on my own.

00:41:31,469 --> 00:41:32,904
That's why I'm here.
We understand that.

00:41:32,904 --> 00:41:33,938
No, we understand--
We understand--
to simplify it...

00:41:33,938 --> 00:41:35,306
it's not about the money
with us.

00:41:35,306 --> 00:41:38,743
It's about the undertaking
of... educating you

00:41:38,743 --> 00:41:41,980
with this entire process.
It's--It's a lot.

00:41:44,282 --> 00:41:45,783
Do we have a deal?

00:41:47,785 --> 00:41:51,489
You have a deal.
All right.

00:41:51,489 --> 00:41:52,757
Oh!
Thank you.

00:41:52,757 --> 00:41:54,726
There you go.
I will work
very, very hard.

00:41:54,726 --> 00:41:56,261
(Daymond) Please do.
Thank you.

00:41:56,261 --> 00:41:58,062
I believe in you.
Thank you so much.

00:41:58,062 --> 00:41:59,531
That means so much.

00:41:59,531 --> 00:42:01,866
I-I just--I'm in shock
as to what happened here.

00:42:01,866 --> 00:42:04,269
Thanks, guys.
Amber, thank you.

00:42:04,269 --> 00:42:05,904
(shrieks) Yay!

00:42:05,904 --> 00:42:08,406
(chuckles)
(shrieks)

00:42:08,406 --> 00:42:10,008
What did you see in her?

00:42:10,008 --> 00:42:11,309
(Kevin)
Lori, she dresses dogs.

00:42:11,309 --> 00:42:13,511
You know what? You are
judging her way too harshly.

00:42:13,511 --> 00:42:15,446
Well, that's why I kept quiet.
I didn't want to be a hater.

00:42:15,446 --> 00:42:17,916
What--what's this hater stuff?
The dog has a bow tie on.
You know what?

00:42:17,916 --> 00:42:21,185
It's ridiculous.
Now I'm gonna prove you wrong.
You know me.

00:42:21,185 --> 00:42:23,688
That was a lot of hard work.
And that was really intense.

00:42:23,688 --> 00:42:26,324
(high-pitched voice)
You did it!
(exhales deeply)
