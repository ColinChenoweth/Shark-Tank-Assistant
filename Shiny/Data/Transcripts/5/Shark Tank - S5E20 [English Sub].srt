00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:02,736
NARRATOR:
Tonight, by popular demand,

00:00:02,736 --> 00:00:05,739
it's a very special
young-entrepreneur episode

00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:09,276
of "Shark Tank," where we look
to the future of America.

00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:11,578
I may be young, but I can make
a difference in this world.

00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:15,849
NARRATOR:
Millions of young Americans
are inspired by "Shark Tank,"

00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,919
and many feel they can do
as well as the adults.

00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:20,320
HERJAVEC: We treated you

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,489
just like we did anybody
at any age.

00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:23,991
It's real money.
It's real serious.

00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:25,459
Let me show you how it works.

00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:27,995
NARRATOR: Tonight, we give them
a chance to pitch the sharks

00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:30,964
in hopes of getting
an investment to start, grow,

00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:32,499
or save their businesses.

00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:33,901
It's not just for kids.

00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:36,169
I'm in 300 stores in 34 states.

00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:37,738
My parents have taken out
a mortgage.

00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:38,872
D'oh.

00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,040
NARRATOR:
They must convince a shark

00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,309
to invest the full amount
they're asking for,

00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:44,111
or they'll walk away
with nothing.

00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:46,213
You have
serious competition.

00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,815
$40,000 is
an absolute-nothing burger.

00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:51,251
I immigrated to America
when I was 6 years old.

00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:54,121
I was about to go to the U.S.
Open until I broke my back.

00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:56,223
NARRATOR:
If the sharks hear a good idea,

00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,892
they're ready to invest
using their own money.

00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,961
What if we gave them 300k?
Are you nuts?

00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:02,696
NARRATOR: And they're willing
to fight each other

00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:04,164
for a piece of the action.

00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:06,033
I'm the only shark that wants
to help the children.

00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:07,301
Oh, my God.

00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:08,468
He just wants
to be a vampire

00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:10,270
that sucks the money
out of other businesses.

00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,605
Mark, why don't you just stick
your head in that beehive?

00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:12,739
GREINER: [laughs]

00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,375
NARRATOR:
Who are the sharks?

00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:18,512
They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors

00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:20,647
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,785
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist

00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:27,154
who turned a $10,000 loan

00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:31,758
into a software business
worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:36,263
Barbara Corcoran went
from waiting tables in Manhattan

00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,932
to building the city's
preeminent real-estate empire.

00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:43,503
Robert Herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,

00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:45,372
is now a technology mogul

00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:49,910
who sold his first internet
companies for over $350 million.

00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:53,413
Lori Greiner, the queen of QVC,

00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:57,484
holds over 100 patents and
has launched over 300 products,

00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:01,288
grossing over a half a billion
dollars in retail sales.

00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,323
And Mark Cuban,

00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:05,258
notorious billionaire
entrepreneur, tech guru,

00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:10,076
and the outspoken owner
of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.

00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,609
First into the tank
is an entrepreneur

00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,945
with an easier
and more appealing way

00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:26,546
to drink healthy beverages.

00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,587
Hello, sharks.
My name is Carter Kostler.

00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:35,622
I'm from Virginia Beach,
Virginia,

00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,724
and my company
is the Define Bottle.

00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:39,593
Today, I'm seeking $100,000

00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:42,529
in exchange for 20% equity
in my company.

00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:46,733
There is an epidemic of soda
in our refrigerators.

00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:49,336
Everyone knows these
sugary drinks are bad for you,

00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:52,272
yet the average American
continues to drink

00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,807
one or two cans a day.

00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:55,509
You should be grabbing a water,

00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,544
but plain water
is just so boring.

00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:00,480
If only there were
a simple and healthy way

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,349
to make water more exciting.

00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,384
Oh, that's right, there is.

00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:07,587
Introducing my product,
the Define Bottle,

00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,189
a simple and beautiful way

00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,258
to take fresh,
fruit-infused water to go.

00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,460
Let me show you how it works.

00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,228
First thing you're gonna do
is chop up

00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:17,097
your freshly sliced fruit
of your choice.

00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:18,465
Place it in the bottom chamber,

00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,267
where there is a refreezable
base piece

00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:21,635
that helps keep your fruit cool.

00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:24,438
Add your strainer piece and your
top chamber and fill with water.

00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:27,274
Notice, when I fill
the Define Bottle up with water,

00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:28,842
the water goes down
into the bottom,

00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:30,777
but the fruit does not rise
to the mouthpiece.

00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:36,149
Add your lid, pop your top,
and you're ready to go.

00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:38,151
After about 15 minutes,

00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:39,986
the water will be infused
by the fruit,

00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,222
adding a refreshing hint
of flavor.

00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,223
Clever.

00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,458
Now, sharks, I have

00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,826
a Define Bottle
for each of you

00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:47,894
filled
with your favorite fruit.

00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,464
Okay.
There you go, Robert.

00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:52,232
Thanks, Carter.
No problem.

00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,701
And then, Kevin,
we got Mango.

00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:55,969
Yes.
It's your favorite.

00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,170
You didn't have any
with garlic?

00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,638
Garlic?
For this guy.

00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:00,107
CUBAN:
Garlic kills vampires.

00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:02,242
Oh, wow,
that's great, Carter.

00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,510
KOSTLER:
Congratulations.

00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,012
You are doing something
to improve your health.

00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:09,883
I may be young, but that does
not hold be back from knowing

00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:11,918
that I can make a difference
in this world.

00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,520
Now I'm looking for a partner

00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,022
to help me transform
the way people hydrate.

00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:18,658
So, sharks,
who wants to help the world

00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,794
define what they drink?

00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,996
So, Carter,
how young are you?

00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,564
I am 15.

00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:25,966
What?
15?!

00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:27,601
Are you kidding?
You look at least 16.

00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:28,802
CUBAN: You look a whole lot
older than 15, Carter.
Really? Well, thank you.

00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:30,337
Absolutely.
Oh, my gosh.

00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:31,938
Did you create this yourself?

00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,473
Yeah, I created it
when I was 13 years old.

00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:35,041
The story is my mom

00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,244
got really into the whole
fruit-infused-water scene.

00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:39,045
But whenever my mom
left the house,

00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:41,348
she always grabbed soda
or a juice.

00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:42,649
So, I wanted my mom

00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,651
to enjoy those fresh,
fruit-infused water recipes

00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,386
when she left the house.

00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:49,389
So, I did some sketches
on a little legal pad,

00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:52,192
and I pitched the idea
to my parents.

00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:53,426
What are your sales?

00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:57,164
We have done $65,000 in sales
since may 15th.

00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:58,198
Wow.

00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:01,368
In 4 months, $65,000?
Yes.

00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:04,471
And was that at wholesale
or at retail?

00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,873
Well, 50% of our sales
have been online.

00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,308
50% have been wholesale.

00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,678
We sold them on our website,
and we have retail accounts.

00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,647
Who do you have
as retailers?

00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,949
Whole Foods,
Davids Teas in Canada.

00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,551
Carter, how did
Davids Tea find you?

00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:18,885
How did Whole Foods
find you?

00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:21,521
I cold-called companies,
so I walked into Whole Foods --

00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:22,722
Like, right at the store?

00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,157
Literally, right at the store --

00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,793
walked in, said, "Hey, can I
speak to the produce manager?"

00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,662
Shake his hand, looked him
in the eye, and I say,

00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,797
"Sir, this product is gonna be
excellent at Whole Foods."

00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,065
Love the hustle,
my friend.

00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,366
Thank you.

00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,535
We got invited to the whole
foods farmers' market,

00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:37,604
and we did $1,000 worth
of bottles in 3 hours.

00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:39,873
Tell me about
the Davids Tea order.

00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:41,308
Is that a firm order?

00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:44,911
Yes, we did a order of 165
bottles, and they all sold out.

00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:46,046
They loved it.

00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:48,615
Okay, and do -- do you have
a reorder from them?

00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:50,550
We don't have a reorder yet.
Why?

00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,752
It's -- it's too early, I think.
Why?

00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,955
Carter, let me go back
for a second.

00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:57,090
What do you sell it for
at retail,

00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,158
and what does it
cost you?

00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:00,227
The retail price
for that bottle is $30,

00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:02,829
and it costs,
to get to our door, $10.

00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:05,732
But we're currently talking
to a manufacturer over in China,

00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,000
and they have guaranteed us

00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,236
they can get the price
of this bottle down to $5.

00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:10,237
CUBAN:
What about online?

00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:12,038
Where's your traffic coming
from online?

00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:12,973
Right, yeah, absolutely.

00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:14,207
Well, early on,

00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,277
I created fruit-infused-water
recipe websites.

00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:21,147
And my goal was to promote the
Define Bottle on those sites.

00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,883
Okay. What kind of traffic
are you getting,

00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,551
what kind of conversion
are you getting,

00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,253
and what do you know
about your customers?

00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:29,322
Okay, well, we currently get
2,000 hits a day on those sites.

00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:32,025
Okay.
And our conversion rate,
I think it's 0.5.

00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,729
Why do you think your
conversion rate's so low?

00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:38,531
You know, I don't know.

00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:42,135
I have a question, Mark,
that might answer some of this.

00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,203
Yes.

00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:44,871
Are you aware of your
competition out there?

00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,006
Yes.

00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,173
Our biggest competitor,

00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,242
they're currently selling
in Brookstone.

00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,778
It's big. It's bulky.
It's stainless steel.

00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:55,015
You can't see the fruit like
in the Define Bottle you can.

00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,583
And it has little razor blades
on the bottom

00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,418
that require you to mash up
and grind up your fruit.

00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:02,622
The problem is, while it's
very nice and it works well,

00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:07,193
there's a ton of competition
out in the space right now

00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,930
with this exact same
kind of thing.

00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,632
And they're a lot
less expensive,

00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,535
but I think
they also work well.

00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,737
For that reason,
I'm out.

00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:19,339
Okay. Thank you.

00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,575
How much have you spent
developing it?

00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,344
$300,000.

00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:26,012
Wow.
You've got to be kidding.

00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,847
My parents have taken out
a mortgage on the house.

00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,749
D'oh.

00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:33,153
Wow. This is a big bet
you guys have made.

00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:37,290
I think your product's
so darn pretty,

00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,692
I want to own one.

00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:44,297
But $300,000 for your parents
blows my mind.

00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:48,301
Carter, I think you spent
way too much money

00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,837
developing this.
I'd never get my money back.

00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,305
I'm out.

00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,508
Okay.
Well, thank you.

00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:59,579
O'LEARY:
So, there's a tremendous amount
of competition.

00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,781
And in my view,
it's not investable.

00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,249
For that reason, I'm out.

00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:06,152
Okay.

00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:10,857
Two sharks left on either end.

00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:14,494
HERJAVEC: Carter,
here's where I'm at.

00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,396
This is a beautiful,
beautiful design.

00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:18,765
You've got
some great retailers.

00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:21,835
So, that's all good news.
Here's the bad news.

00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,604
You're into a retailer
that gave you a great order,

00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:27,207
and they didn't reorder.
And you don't know why.

00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:29,442
But I like the product.
Thank you.

00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,077
We need to do
some research,

00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,113
but I'm willing
to make you an offer.

00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:43,289
NARRATOR:
Three sharks are out,

00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,226
but Robert is willing
to take a chance.

00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:47,527
I'm willing
to make you an offer.

00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:51,164
I'll give you the $100,000
that you're looking for,

00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:55,869
but because there's risk,
I want 40% of the business.

00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,504
Okay.

00:08:57,504 --> 00:09:00,440
Um...Robert, thank you
so much for your offer.

00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,409
Uh, would you mind
if I go in the hallway

00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04,010
and talk to my parents?

00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,245
Well,
there's another shark.
Don't you want to hear what --

00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:06,479
No, go ahead. no, go ahead.
Talk to your parents.

00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:07,781
Don't you want to find out
what Mr. Cuban's doing?

00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:09,716
No, I want him to talk
to his parents first.

00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:10,717
[laughs]

00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:11,885
Okay, thank you.

00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,056
Lori, Barbara...
Uh-huh.

00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,157
...And Kevin are out.

00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:19,592
Robert is asking for 40%.

00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,761
Have you told them
what assets you have yet?

00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:22,796
No, I have not.
It didn't come up yet.

00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:23,797
Should he ask more
to help us out?

00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:25,031
Oh, well, then,
you need to do that.

00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,366
That's my opinion that you need
to go back and say...

00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:27,634
They didn't ask.
..."Here's what my --

00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:29,069
and here's what
the company is worth."

00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,370
Mark,
what are you thinking?

00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,572
At 15,
when I had my businesses,

00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,641
I could walk into anywhere.
No one's gonna say no.

00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,443
Everybody's always gonna
give you a chance.

00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:37,811
Right, no one's gonna be
mean to a kid.

00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:40,914
So, there's a balance between
what's real and sustainable

00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,148
by the product itself

00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:45,085
and what's just the carry
of him being a kid.

00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,286
But I don't know that.

00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,221
But that said,
it's a cool product.

00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,626
Carter, welcome back.

00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:57,597
So, the offer was $100,000
for 40%.

00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:02,102
Right. My parents and I
discussed it out there,

00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:05,638
and we think that our company is
worth a little more than that.

00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:06,973
We -- we have assets.

00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:12,212
We have $85,000 in tooling,
150 grand in inventory.

00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:15,281
We have sales of $65,000
since May 15th,

00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,118
projected sales of $200,000
this year,

00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,320
$400,000 in sales next year.

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,355
Carter, what do you think
it's worth?

00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:25,125
Uh, $500,000.

00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,964
So, you are not going to take
his offer of $100,000 for 40%.

00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,198
That's what I hear.

00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:35,935
Well, Robert, would you
be willing to do 30%?

00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:41,741
It's like I said.
We have assets.

00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,543
Carter, the assets
are only worth something

00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:44,844
if the company
is successful.

00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:47,247
It's not like
if you stumble,

00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:49,883
we can sell the assets
for something else.

00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,618
I appreciate
where you're coming from,

00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:54,554
but I'm not gonna take
your counteroffer

00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:56,356
because I think there's
a tremendous amount of risk

00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:57,891
that all the other sharks
have brought up.

00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:00,927
I can't get to the valuation
that you have

00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:03,329
and marry it
against that risk.

00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,931
I'm out.

00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:06,866
Okay. Thank you.

00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:12,038
I'm trying to find reasons
to say yes, Carter.

00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,706
But the fact
that your parents

00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,708
took out a mortgage
to support this --

00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,611
that just puts so much stress
on the whole thing,

00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:22,916
and you didn't give me enough
depth on your competition

00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,617
to have any type
of confidence

00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:25,919
that the competition

00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,555
isn't just going
to dominate this market.

00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:31,958
And for that reason,
I have to say I'm out.

00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,726
Okay.

00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,895
You did a great job in here,
though, presenting yourself.

00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,197
Thank you.

00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,133
We treated you just like we did
anybody at any age.

00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:41,467
You should be
very proud of that.

00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,336
Thank you all so much.
Good luck, Carter.

00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:49,242
I think it's remarkable
that he was 15 years old.

00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:50,810
Remarkable.

00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,645
Hey.
MOM: How'd it go?

00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,414
Not well.
We didn't get a deal.

00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:56,916
KOSTLER: You know,
the future is very bright.

00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,551
Our sales are going up and up,

00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,453
and even though this might be
a little setback,

00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,155
we're just gonna move on
and keep rolling.

00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,363
NARRATOR: Last season,
we saw 11-year-old Ryan Kelly

00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:13,032
and his mom, Daniela,
make a deal with Barbara

00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:15,969
for his homemade-dog-treats
company, Ryan's Barkery.

00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:17,136
Have you sold
any of these?

00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,272
We've sold
about 200 bags of them.

00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:20,773
I'd love to make you
a full-price offer.

00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,075
We have a deal.

00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,276
Aah!
Yeah, there you go!
MAN: All right.

00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:24,978
NARRATOR: Let's see
what they're up to now.

00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:28,248
RYAN: Barbara really made
a lot of things happen

00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,282
for Ryan's Barkery.

00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:30,984
She helped us get
into stew Leonard's,

00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:32,619
and it feels like a dream.

00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:34,654
Hey, everybody!
Ryan!
Hi!

00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:37,090
CORCORAN: Stew Leonard's is
a landmark in the local area,

00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,825
and most importantly,
they have customers.

00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:39,859
And that's why we're here.

00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,060
You want pumpkin-apple?

00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,529
I feel super-excited
about my business.

00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,666
I have a new logo and a great,
new, professional packaging.

00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,301
And it looks amazing.

00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:51,104
Before "Shark Tank,"
I made about $900,

00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:54,607
and in 5 months,
I've made over $70,000.

00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,409
So, first,
you need a shirt.

00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:57,777
Ryan has a new sales strategy.

00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,012
Go start selling.

00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:01,948
He's recruiting other kids
to sell his dog biscuits

00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:04,250
in their local town,
their local neighborhood,

00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,885
and to their lacrosse team.
Ha!

00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:06,819
[whistle blows]

00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,554
Who's got a dog?
You got a dog?

00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,556
You got a dog?
You want to see a picture?

00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:11,758
No, we want to sell you
some dog food.

00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:13,226
Oh.

00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:15,528
Watching Ryan go through
this "Shark Tank" experience --

00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,665
it's been wonderful
to watch him grow into

00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:20,233
what he's really capable of.

00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:21,668
So, how much
did we make?

00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:23,770
ALL: $1,019.

00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:24,804
Oh, my!

00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,272
I feel that Barbara
invested in me

00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:29,108
because she sees a lot
of potential in the business.

00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:30,476
And I think she's right.

00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:42,922
NARRATOR:
Next up is a student

00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:45,992
who hopes to save the planet
from electronic waste.

00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:56,669
Hi. My name is Jason, and
I'm the proud owner of iReTron.

00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:02,075
Today, I'm seeking $100,000 in
exchange for 20% of my company.

00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:03,743
As a social enterprise,

00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:06,746
iReTron is an online,
recommerce business

00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:10,016
that buys used
or unwanted electronics.

00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,719
Not only do we offer
the highest price on the market,

00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:15,088
but we are also
the greenest place for you

00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:17,490
to get rid of your cellphones,
calculators,

00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,092
MP3 players, and more.

00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:22,228
Now, sharks,
I know you guys always want

00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,931
the biggest, baddest, newest,
smartest smartphones

00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:26,366
there is to offer.

00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:29,102
However, not everyone
is that case.

00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:32,605
In fact me, myself, I don't
even want the newest model.

00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:36,342
And thus, iReTron caters to them
by providing older phones

00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,544
that still have years of life
left in them

00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,514
to people who can't pay the
full price for their technology.

00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:46,119
The best part is it's as easy
as, one, go on our website

00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:48,154
and receive an instant quote,

00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:51,624
and number two, ship us
your product free of charge.

00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:55,728
And finally, 3, get paid
in less than 48 hours.

00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,631
It's green for the world.
It's green for your wallet.

00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:02,068
What do you say, sharks?
Time for you to retron.

00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,370
Walk me
through an example.

00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,740
I sell you my old phone.
Right.

00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,008
Do you fix it up then

00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,177
and try to sell it
to somebody else?

00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:12,779
We'll inspect it
within 48 hours,

00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,013
then we'll send you a check.

00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,415
Okay.
So, your part is done.

00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:18,651
Do you have a guaranteed buyer
on your end?

00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:19,886
Yes.
And that's been proven

00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:21,487
because we've been running this
for two years,

00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,189
and we have zero inventory,

00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:25,458
meaning that it never
gets stuck.

00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,293
All right, selling it
is so much easier

00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:28,928
than actually getting
the product,

00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,029
and that's what we need
to work on.

00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,431
We need to market

00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,633
because I haven't spent any
money yet on advertisements.

00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,034
Jason,
what makes you different

00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:36,569
from the other 90 guys
doing this?

00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:38,104
Doing the exact same thing.

00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,572
LI: Right.

00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:41,674
Um, so, yes, I am aware that
we do have a lot of competition,

00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,576
but the one thing
that separates us

00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:45,411
is that
we're a social enterprise.

00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:46,913
If you look at our website,

00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:49,182
we accept over 5,000
different products,

00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:51,818
including products
that have literally no value

00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:54,420
because, number one,
it's environmentally friendly,

00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,089
and, number two, it's a simple
way of customer acquisition.

00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:58,558
So, you're basically
telling me

00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:00,326
you're making less for me
as an investor

00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,762
because you're buying stuff
that nobody wants,

00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,130
so that costs me.

00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,632
You're paying higher prices,
which kills my margins.

00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,368
Everybody's telling me they're
green because that's for free.

00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:10,870
Anybody can say that.
Mm-hmm.

00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,905
But there's so much competition.

00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:16,209
In fact, if you Google this,
there's so many pages,

00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,110
you'll die of old age
getting to the last.

00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,913
But if you Google us right now,
if you search, "sell my Kindle,"

00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,348
we're actually on the first page
of Google.

00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:24,750
All right, Jason.
Let's forget what Kevin says.

00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,987
Let's see what the market says.
What are your sales?

00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,090
So, in the past 12 months,
we made $40,000.

00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,326
And I don't want you guys

00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,528
to get caught up in the numbers
because --
Why not?

00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:37,263
Because you have to look
at our growth rate first.

00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:38,564
Our first --

00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:42,568
$40,000 in this industry
is an absolute-nothing burger.

00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:46,372
On that $40,000 that you made
in profit, how much --

00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:47,840
LI: $10,000.

00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,909
So, we have about
a 25% net-profit margin.

00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:51,611
Jason,
do you do this full-time?

00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:53,646
No. I'm 16 years old.
I'm a senior in high --

00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:54,814
Oh, you're only 16?
You're 16?

00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:56,182
Wow.
Yeah.

00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,717
Look at the size of you.
Wow. I thought
you were in college.

00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:58,751
I thought you were,
like, 25.

00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,086
Oh, no, no, no.
CUBAN: Freshman.

00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:01,420
Oh, yeah.
You look very mature.

00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,522
LI: Thank you.
So, I have a question.

00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:03,756
Now we have to be
nicer to you.

00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:07,627
You're obviously very savvy.
You know what's out there.

00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:10,396
What do you think you have
to offer that's better?

00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:13,399
Um, well, the one thing
that separates us --

00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:16,769
you know, we're not always,
you know, 100% profit-driven.

00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,905
We care about social,
environment,

00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:20,273
and profit all equally.

00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:21,741
Jason, what drives you?

00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:23,175
Is it
the social responsibility,

00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,077
or are you -- are you trying
to build a business?

00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:27,580
I think there was --
there's a lot of things.

00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,917
Um, I immigrated to America
when I was 6 years old.

00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:32,985
Where'd you come from?
China.

00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:34,554
I always wanted to be
independent,

00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,088
and I always wanted
to contribute

00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,456
rather than to take for myself.

00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:40,326
I like to say that had
two passions in my life.

00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:42,695
One is judo,
and the other is iReTron.

00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:45,998
And so, with judo, I started
that when I was 5 years old,

00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:48,301
and I wasn't half bad, either.
I got to nationals.

00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:49,468
That's great.

00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:50,836
And I was about to go
to the U.S. Open

00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,306
until, um, I broke my back.

00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:54,974
[gasps] Wow.

00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:57,076
And in the month
that I was in bed resting,

00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,812
I began reading a lot of books,
and one of them was called

00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:02,214
"How to Change the World"
by David Bornstein...

00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:03,516
Mm.

00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:05,418
...In which he talks about
social entrepreneurship

00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,586
in third-world countries

00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,487
and how that's really
making a difference.

00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,590
Jason, I just read
in the "Wall Street Journal"

00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,793
that something like 85%
of all new businesses

00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:17,430
are started by immigrants
or children of immigrants.

00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,967
I admire how far
you've come at 16

00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:22,301
because, my friend, at 16,

00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:26,439
I wasn't anywhere near
where you are right now.

00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,140
Thank you so much.

00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,844
The business you presented
today -- I'm not seeing it.

00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:35,448
And to give you $100,000 --
I just don't think I see

00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:38,884
how it's gonna make
the business better.

00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,786
I wish you all the best,
but I'm out.

00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,321
Thank you.

00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,991
Look, when I was 16,
I wasn't doing electronics,

00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:47,126
but I was buying
and selling stamps.

00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,694
I already knew
what I could sell it for...

00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:50,429
Mm-hmm.
...So I could flip it
very quickly.

00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:51,530
Exactly what this is.

00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,432
That's exactly
what this is.
Right.

00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,801
But the point is right now
you're forced to hustle.

00:18:55,801 --> 00:19:00,106
Everything is,
"I've got to go out there

00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:02,074
and figure out how to pay for it
before I do it."

00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,743
Uh-huh.
Right?

00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:06,412
Introducing that much capital
into a business,

00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:09,815
it gives you a comfort level
that you shouldn't have,

00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,450
particularly while
you're still in school.

00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,552
I mean,
I love what you're doing,

00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:14,854
but it scares me

00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:17,356
that the money would take you
in a different direction.

00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:20,326
And so, for that reason,
I'm out.

00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,961
Well, thank you very much
for your time.

00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:24,397
And really, part of this

00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:26,499
is all about inspiring
the next generation.

00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,434
[chuckling] Jason, you got
to deal with your generation

00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:29,535
Before you worry
about the next generation.

00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:30,469
Exactly.
No, and that's the thing.

00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:31,570
I was thinking, "You know what?

00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,039
"Next generation,
next generation --

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,073
that's my generation."

00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:35,775
So, it's up to me
to make a solution.

00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:37,043
And it's up to me

00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:39,812
to inspire all of my friends
and all of my peers.

00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:43,115
Jason, you valued this
at $500,000, okay?
Yes.

00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,885
So, one test that you should
always do in your own mind

00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:49,188
before you come in front
of an investor like me is,

00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,790
"Could I do this myself

00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:54,093
and own 100% of it
for a lot less than $500,000?"

00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:56,228
Because there's nothing
proprietary

00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:57,663
about what you're doing.

00:19:57,663 --> 00:20:02,234
So, you've failed that test,
and, for that reason, I'm out.

00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:04,003
All right, well, thank you
very much for your time.

00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:05,971
CORCORAN: Hallelujah,
I can speak. Okay.

00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,307
I'm not sure about this
business, all right?

00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,676
I don't know if it's gonna win
or it's gonna lose.

00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,345
So, it's a big question Mark,
quite honestly, in my head.

00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:16,949
But what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna offer you $100,000

00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,585
for the 20% in your business
for one reason only.

00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:23,122
I feel like
you're a winner.

00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:25,891
I don't know what form
that winning's gonna take,

00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,494
all right, but it comes
with a big contingency.

00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:30,796
The contingency is --
well, twofold --

00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:33,232
one, you're gonna get the money
on an as-needed basis

00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,400
'cause you're only 16.
[laughs]

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,570
You talk like you're 30,
but you're only 16.

00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,205
The other contingency is

00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:44,643
I want to have 20% of any
business you think about

00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,412
and start
over the next five years.

00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:49,215
That is the kind of greed
that just disgusts me.

00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:52,284
I'm putting a big, blank
check in on you,

00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:53,886
which makes no sense,

00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:56,455
but I can't help but to feel
you are a winner.

00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:57,423
Wow.

00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,225
Thank you. Um...

00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:00,860
Well,
I think you're great.

00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,194
I love what you're doing

00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,296
because you're
a young entrepreneur.

00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:07,500
I think that Barbara
has offered you a deal,

00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,802
and it's a lot better
than what I would have offered,

00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:12,438
so, for that reason,
I'll go out.

00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:13,506
All right.

00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:15,508
Well, thank you very much
for your time.

00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:18,978
So, Barbara, I love your offer,
but if I can address Mark?

00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:20,613
No problem at all.
Thank you.

00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,181
She knows I'm not gonna try
to steal off that.
Thank you very much.

00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:25,184
And so, Mark, look, honestly,
I'm not gonna stop hustling.

00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:28,587
I've been working on this
for the past two years,

00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:32,658
and I'm reaching a level
where I-I can't do any more

00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:33,993
than what I can right now,

00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:36,762
as in, like, I don't have
the ability or the knowledge.

00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:39,932
And I really love the both of
you, and I would really love it

00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:41,600
if both of you can -- you know,

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,536
if I could work
with both of you.

00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:45,771
Would you guys like to come in
on this together?

00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,108
I'll tell you this.
I'll tell you.

00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:50,643
You do this deal
with Barbara.

00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,378
I'll be a partner
with Barbara in it.

00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:54,046
I-I'll split it.
I'll split it with you.

00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:55,748
Yeah, I'll take money
from you. Why not?

00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:56,882
You'll split it?
Yeah.

00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:59,318
Um, let's do work.

00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,386
Hey.
There you go.

00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:01,620
"Let's do work."
I like it.

00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,088
HERJAVEC: Wow.
You're gonna make me
do work.

00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:05,191
GREINER: Good one.
Congratulations, Jason, man.

00:22:05,191 --> 00:22:06,892
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.

00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:08,027
You made yourself
a good deal.

00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:09,461
Thank you.
Nicely done.

00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:10,629
[laughs]

00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:11,931
Jason, you just proved
the American dream

00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:13,299
is alive and well.

00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:15,067
I'm trying to -- doing my best.

00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:16,235
Good luck.

00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:17,670
I like that.
"Doing work."

00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,605
Thank you.
I could use your help.

00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:21,607
I can't believe I just
shook hands with Mark Cuban.

00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:24,343
I can't believe I just --
oh, yeah.

00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:39,058
NARRATOR: Next into the tank
is a 6-year-old

00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:41,994
with a product she invented
with some help from her dad.

00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:48,667
Hi, sharks.
I'm Kiowa Grace Kavovit.

00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,502
And I'm her dad,
Andrew Kavovit,

00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:53,305
and we are here seeking
an investment of $100,000...

00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,975
As well as your relationships
and ideas...

00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:59,712
In exchange for 17.5% of
our company, boo boo brands.

00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,847
So, please check out
this video we made

00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:04,083
to help boo boo goo
come to life for you.

00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:05,651
As an active 6-year-old,

00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:08,320
cuts and scrapes
are just a part of life.

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,389
But not all boo-boos
are created equal.

00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,025
And how am I supposed to
keep doing what kids do

00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:15,194
if every little boo-boo
requires this?

00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:17,596
[dramatic tones play]

00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:19,098
Besides,
those sticky things hurt,

00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:21,800
and they always come off
when I want them to stay on.

00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,570
It's time kids think differently
about the world,

00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,973
and I'm starting by cleaning up
one little boo-boo at a time.

00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:31,043
So, I created this
one-of-a-kind, paint-on bandage.

00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:34,013
Now, if I get a small cut
or boo-boo, I just clean it,

00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:36,282
dry it, pick my color,
and paint it on.

00:23:36,282 --> 00:23:37,816
Huh.
And it's waterproof.

00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:38,951
Thanks, Mom.

00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,388
And for those big nights out,

00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:46,358
I choose the skin color to
conceal my boo-boos completely.

00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:47,459
Let's go, Daddy.

00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:49,762
Bye-bye, boo-boos,
and bye-bye, drama.

00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,766
So, sharks, as you see,

00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,801
BooBoo Goo is a playful
and less-intimidating way

00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,269
to deal with boo-boos.

00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,972
But make no mistake -- while
our product is kid-friendly...

00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:01,373
It's not just for kids.

00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,642
Our patent-pending formula
was actually developed

00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:05,611
by a team of leading
wound-care chemists.

00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:06,946
And me and my friends love

00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:09,682
that it comes in a bunch
of fun colors and skin tones.

00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:10,816
So, you can seal it...

00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:11,784
And conceal it.

00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,552
So, who wants
to come help the world

00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,621
and clean up one boo-boo
at a time?

00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:18,590
Thank you, sharks.
We have some samples here

00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,059
that Kiowa
would like to hand out.

00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:22,261
And if you have any questions,
we'd be happy to answer them.

00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:23,495
We made
some special colors.

00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:25,030
There's a skin tone
for you, Robert.

00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,598
Thank you.
We have pink for you,
Lori.

00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:27,666
Thank you, Kiowa.

00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,034
Mr. Wonderful,
your favorite green.

00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:31,103
Uh-huh.
Thank you.
You did great.

00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:32,838
Barbara, we have another
skin tone for you.

00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:36,275
Thank you.
And we made a Maverick blue
for you, Mr. Cuban.

00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:39,378
How did you come up
with the idea?

00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:41,847
I never liked band-aids,
and I didn't want people

00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:43,115
ohh.

00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:45,184
To see that I had something
'cause look at the board.

00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:47,019
There's boo boo goo,

00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:48,821
there's the other
paint-on bandage,

00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:50,389
and there's the band-aid.

00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:51,824
Hmm.
Which one
do you like best?

00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,025
GREINER:
Great, little sales lady.
Yeah.

00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:54,760
Who's your favorite shark,
by the way?

00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,961
Go ahead.
You can say.

00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:57,930
HERJAVEC: All the sharks
are her favorite.

00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,298
Who? Kevin?
Mr. Wonderful?

00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:00,632
I like all of you.

00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:01,967
ALL: Ah.
Oh, political.

00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:03,235
You saw where she pointed.

00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:04,837
She's gonna be
a politician one day.

00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:07,339
These are prototypes.
ANDREW: Correct.

00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,708
Prototype bottles,
if I can clarify.

00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,977
Prototype bottles.
The formula
is actually finalized.

00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:13,712
As I mentioned,
it's been developed

00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:15,681
by a leading team
of wound-care chemists.

00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,149
They broke through

00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:20,786
with a completely novel
and unique formulation.

00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:21,987
What made it unique?

00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:23,722
What was -- what was special
about the formulation?

00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:25,891
The most special thing
is our actual sealant.

00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:27,459
It's what makes it
waterproof.

00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:28,927
Do you have a patent on it?

00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:32,297
The patent is pending, um,
and we're gonna continue

00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,967
to evolve that patent as
they strengthen the technology.

00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:37,369
Is it something natural?
It is something natural.

00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,039
What's left on the skin
at the end of the day

00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,708
is a completely natural
and organic, pliable,

00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,410
skin-like,
waterproof barrier.

00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,645
You have
serious competition.

00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:50,115
The major brands make

00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:53,852
a spray-on type of product
that's very similar.

00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:56,288
Yeah.
It's a liquid bandage.

00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:57,856
Yours is colored...
Mm-hmm.

00:25:57,856 --> 00:25:59,658
...But I don't think
I'm grasping

00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:01,794
what is your
major advantage

00:26:01,794 --> 00:26:05,130
or why you would be able
to take over the market?

00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,532
We think it's very clear

00:26:06,532 --> 00:26:09,535
that a person would not want
a scabbed wound showing,

00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:12,638
which is all the liquid
bandages service now.

00:26:12,638 --> 00:26:14,973
Also, all the liquid-bandages
formulations

00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:17,543
on the market currently
are actually flammable.

00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:19,044
They're found
in the medical aisle,

00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:20,112
not in the band-aid aisle.

00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:21,847
So, they have not
crossed over

00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:23,649
to any kind
of mainstream market

00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:24,750
and certainly haven't tapped

00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,118
into the 70%
of bandage users,

00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:28,320
which is kids
3 to 15 years old.

00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,490
How are you gonna create
an identity in that market?

00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,624
With the right partners.

00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:35,694
We have interest already
from QVC.

00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:37,362
Lori, is this a product
we can sell on QVC?

00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:41,633
You know, I don't personally
see this as a QVC product.

00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:43,235
O'LEARY: I think the problem
with your deal

00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:44,536
that the sharks
have identified,

00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,305
and I'm certainly
in this camp now,

00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:48,640
is for you to get
any significant share in retail,

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,510
it's a very, very difficult,
uphill battle.

00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:54,313
So, is there an opportunity
to take this

00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:56,515
and go
to the majors and say,

00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:59,485
"I have a better mouse trap
in the liquid-band-aid space.

00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:01,253
"Look at the colors.
It's a better product.

00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:02,187
License it from me."

00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:03,922
That's exactly
the intention.

00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:05,991
Look, this isn't
a small-camp thing.

00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:08,627
This is a big product
in a billion-dollar category.

00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:12,264
The fact is we need people
like you on the team.

00:27:12,264 --> 00:27:14,700
Kiowa, do you know
what earmuffs are?

00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:17,102
Do the earmuffs.

00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:18,804
CORCORAN: Aw.
Aw, come on, Mark.

00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,339
GREINER: Aw.
What do you got, Mark?
She can take it.

00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:21,340
She can take it?
Okay.
CORCORAN: Come on.

00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,075
Look, the liquid bandages,

00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:24,343
for the most part,
are geared towards adults.

00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:26,178
I've got three young kids,

00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:29,114
and they're gonna still see
the scab or the wound, right,

00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:30,816
and they're still gonna
pick at it, right?

00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:33,719
Second, trying
to get this stuff off --

00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:35,020
That's exactly the point,
Mark.

00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,555
You put our product on
in the morning.

00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:37,789
You don't reapply it.

00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,591
There will be no chase
another band-aid down.

00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:40,826
There's no falling it off
in the pool

00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,327
when it's disgusting.

00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,930
It's still a lot
of high-dollar players

00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,698
that you're gonna be
competing with.

00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:49,067
And you have to go through
the re-education process.

00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:50,302
That re-education process

00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:52,571
can't just be putting
the product on the shelf.

00:27:52,571 --> 00:27:54,373
And so, for that reason,
I'm out.

00:27:54,373 --> 00:27:55,507
Fair enough.
Thank you.

00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,876
First off,
it's very painful for me

00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:00,012
to watch you
go down this path.

00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:02,614
I don't think there's a need
for this product -- period.

00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:04,383
This is band-aids
that kids love picking at.

00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:05,817
Whether they do
a good job or not,

00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:07,619
parents love sticking them
on the kids' legs.

00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:10,055
For those reasons, I'm out.

00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,358
Andrew, they already have
a liquid bandage.

00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,994
I think the fact that there's
color to a liquid bandage --

00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:18,597
'cause we use them --
is interesting.

00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:21,300
But I think, today,
what you haven't proven

00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,802
is that that's unique enough
to be sold.

00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:26,705
And you haven't proven
it'll sell.

00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,507
Just too early
and not enough data today.

00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:29,408
I'm out.

00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:31,677
Fair enough.
Thank you, Robert.

00:28:31,677 --> 00:28:35,113
I like that you created --
you added the color to it.

00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:36,648
I mean, it's inventive.

00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:40,118
But I think
there's too much competition.

00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:43,388
I hope you do get your patent,
and I wish you good luck.

00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,556
Without having it,

00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,292
I feel that you're gonna
really have a struggle.

00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:50,529
But you're beautiful, little
daughter is an inventor.

00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:51,797
Yeah.
And that's fantastic.

00:28:51,797 --> 00:28:53,265
Yeah.
You're thinking of things.

00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:55,667
Keep thinking.
You're so young right now

00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:58,604
that you could set the world on
fire with more and more ideas.

00:28:58,604 --> 00:29:01,773
It only takes one
to become successful.

00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,843
So, I'm out.

00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:06,144
Thank you.

00:29:07,546 --> 00:29:09,448
Mr. Wonderful.

00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:12,284
Um, I'm stuck on the,
um, distribution strategy

00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:13,852
without a patent.

00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:17,389
If I really believe the patent
was gonna clear and be issued,

00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:19,558
and I could go --
and I'd be good at this --

00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:21,260
to a major and license it
to them,

00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,694
I'd be a great partner for you.

00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:25,597
But it's not investable

00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,366
till you tell me
that you have a patent.

00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:28,467
You came here without one.

00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:32,537
I like it.

00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:33,972
I think it could capture

00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:35,741
some share
of the $200 million market.

00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:37,643
And that's a growing market,
I think.

00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:40,946
It will, and we'll make the
100 grand back on QVC alone.

00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,547
I actually know
how to defend patents.

00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:43,915
I have a lot
of lawyers on stun.

00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:44,916
And we believe
it's a licensing deal.

00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,018
He's a patent troll.
He's a patent troll.

00:29:46,018 --> 00:29:47,352
I am.

00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:48,387
I'm proud to be one, and
it's what makes America great.

00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:49,788
No, it makes --
It's killing us.

00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,190
We don't agree,
but I'm right as usual.
Killing us.

00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,092
We believe that this
is a licensing play.
Yeah, no.

00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:55,160
We need the leadership
to take it there.
I-I-I get that.

00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,296
Let's work something out.
All right.

00:29:57,296 --> 00:30:01,099
If you want to do a deal
for a contingency

00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:02,934
on getting the patent,
I'll invest the $100,000.

00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:03,869
I want 25%.

00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:05,737
HERJAVEC:
Contingent on the patent.

00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:07,406
Contingent
on the patent clearing.
It has to be.

00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:08,707
It has to be contingent
on the patent.

00:30:08,707 --> 00:30:10,776
That's a reasonable
request.

00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:13,645
It's the value that
we're expecting from this.

00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:17,215
What do you think?

00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:20,185
Yeah?

00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:22,421
[laughs]

00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:23,455
We appreciate it.

00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:24,456
We would love
to take your offer.

00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:26,124
You got it.
Wow.

00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:27,559
Wow.
Jump down, buddy.

00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,961
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:31,830
Thank you.
Appreciate it.

00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,864
And I'll show you.
All right.

00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:33,932
We'll follow through
on this.

00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:35,167
Good invention.
Thank you.

00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,702
Yeah, right?
She's got more coming.

00:30:36,702 --> 00:30:37,836
Thanks.
Good job, Kiowa.
You bet.

00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,104
Thank you, everybody.
Bye-bye.

00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,105
HERJAVEC: Good job, guys.
Nice meeting you all.

00:30:40,105 --> 00:30:41,340
GREINER: Bye.
Good luck.

00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,043
What do you say, girl?
Good job.

00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:47,412
I'm the only shark
that wants to help the children.

00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:48,914
Oh, my God.
CORCORAN: Yeah, sure.

00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:52,217
KIOWA:
I'm really excited,

00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:55,520
and I'm just happy
that we got a deal.

00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:09,701
My name is Henry Miller.
I am 16 years old,

00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,803
and I live on my family farm
in Deming, Washington.

00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:14,239
I've learned a lot
about running my business

00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:15,507
by being on the farm.

00:31:15,507 --> 00:31:18,043
I've built fences,
cleaned up after the animals,

00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:19,010
and I feed them.

00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,512
And sometimes, you just got

00:31:20,512 --> 00:31:22,147
to put a little bit
of elbow grease into it.

00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:25,984
I really like bees

00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:29,121
because they get so much hate
from a lot of people.

00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:30,822
Bees all around the world

00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:33,825
are suffering from
colony collapse disorder.

00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:35,127
Colony collapse disorder

00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:37,329
is a mysterious disease
that will infect the hive,

00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:39,898
and it's very hard
to find the exact cause.

00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,099
I started this company

00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:43,335
to help save the bees
and my family farm.

00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:45,804
My mom calls me
an eco-entrepreneur.

00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:49,941
There's nothing
like my product in stores.

00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:52,277
I created a new category
for honey to be in

00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:53,478
that could change the world.

00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:56,281
If we don't get an investment
from the sharks,

00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:58,116
I feel that we may lose
our farm.

00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:00,252
My mom and dad
have been funneling money

00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:01,686
out of their retirement fund

00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:03,321
and putting it
into the business,

00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:04,556
and I feel like it's my job

00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:06,792
to make this business
succeed for them.

00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,004
CORCORAN:
I hope there's no bees.

00:32:19,004 --> 00:32:20,305
[gasps]

00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:21,706
Ooh.
Creepy.

00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:25,777
Oh, wow.

00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:26,978
Hi, sharks.

00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:28,113
[laughs]

00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,381
CUBAN: [laughs]

00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:31,349
My name is Henry Miller.
I'm from Deming, Washington,

00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:33,785
and I'm seeking $150,000

00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:37,355
for a 25% stake of my incredible
company, Henry's Humdingers,

00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:39,791
the natural condiment,
honey with a kick.

00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,160
It all started back
when I was 11 years old,

00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,396
and I sat next to a beekeeper
on a plane.

00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:46,832
And I learned about
colony collapse disorder.

00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:49,801
Did you know that if all the
bees died, within seven years,

00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,837
the whole food chain
would collapse?

00:32:51,837 --> 00:32:53,371
The unthinkable would happen.

00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:55,740
Mr. Wonderful, you wouldn't be
able to make any more money.

00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,108
Don't worry.
I speak bee.

00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:58,610
[laughter]

00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:01,413
Anyhow, I asked my parents for
a beehive for my 12th birthday,

00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:03,248
and what do you know?
They got me one.

00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:05,450
Next thing you know,
I had so much sweet honey,

00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,085
I didn't know
what to do with it.

00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:09,554
So, I started selling it
on the side of the road.

00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:11,423
And I realized
I need to be different.

00:33:11,423 --> 00:33:13,825
There's so many people out there
selling sweet honey

00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,760
that it just needed to change.

00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,963
And that's how
Henry's Humdingers was born.

00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:22,100
And I turned beekeeping
into a business.

00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,235
And I went from...

00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:24,603
[Southern accent]
Henry's Humdingers...

00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:26,738
[laughter]

00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:28,940
[normal voice]
...To Henry's Humdingers LLC.

00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,710
I take this ancient thing
like honey,

00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:34,913
and I flip it upside down
by adding spices to it.

00:33:34,913 --> 00:33:37,983
It's good in meatloaf,
over chicken, ice cream,

00:33:37,983 --> 00:33:40,218
and even martinis --
so I've been told.

00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:42,287
I brought some samples
for you all to try.

00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:48,860
Thanks, Henry.

00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,061
No problem.

00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:51,496
I love the names.

00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:53,765
Yep, I currently
have four flavors.

00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:56,868
There's Grumpy Grandpa,
Naughty Nana,

00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,871
Phoebe's Fireball,
and Diabolical Dad.

00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,541
Henry, the Diabolical Dad
is fantastic.

00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,309
Naughty Nana is, like --
We've made a cheesecake
out of that.

00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:05,477
Wow.

00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:07,178
Are there other
flavored honeys out there?

00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:09,281
There are other
sweet-flavored honeys,

00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:12,217
but I have not encountered
another spicy-flavored honey.

00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:13,184
Where are you selling?

00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:14,819
What retailers are you
in right now?

00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:18,390
Right now, I'm in 300-plus
stores in 34 states,

00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,892
and I'm in big distributors,
such as unify east.

00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,827
Wow.
And I was in unify west.

00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:24,195
What are your sales?

00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:27,299
My sales -- in the past three
years that I've been --

00:34:27,299 --> 00:34:29,167
been in business, I had $67,000.

00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:30,602
$67,000?
Yeah.

00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:31,670
What about
the last 12 months, Henry?

00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:34,239
Probably about $50,000, I think.

00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,974
Henry, you've been at this
for three years.

00:34:35,974 --> 00:34:37,342
You're in 300 stores.

00:34:37,342 --> 00:34:39,978
$50,000
in the past 12 months.

00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:41,880
Don't you think
they should be higher

00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,049
given the amount of time
you've put into it?

00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:46,418
The main problem is
I don't have the capital.

00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,485
That's why I'm here.

00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:48,653
Got it.

00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:50,221
HERJAVEC: Tell me about
the business today.

00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:51,489
Who's running
this business?

00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:52,958
I mean, obviously,
you didn't drop out of school.

00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:56,127
My mom and dad are both working
at it while I'm at school.

00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:58,430
I make a lot
of the executive decisions.

00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,799
My mom's working full-time.

00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:02,801
She gets paid in love
and teenaged angst.

00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:04,235
Did you mention
how much money

00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:05,337
your parents
put in the business?

00:35:05,337 --> 00:35:06,371
I'm sorry.
I don't think I --

00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:08,640
They have put $150,000.

00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,542
One of my good friends

00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:14,012
is the largest honey provider
in Canada.

00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:15,347
It's a massive operation.

00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:17,716
He's already got
the distribution and so on.

00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:20,151
How do you compete
with something like that?

00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,320
People who have those
large-scale honey things,

00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,788
they don't want to have to go in

00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,824
and clean all of our spices out
every time

00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:27,492
so they can do
their clean honey run.

00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:28,927
So, just so I'm clear,

00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:31,496
I can't go to
an existing honey company

00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:32,764
and add spices to it.

00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:34,466
It would be very expensive.

00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,001
But, Henry,
is there a possibility

00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:38,403
the reason that none of the big
honey guys have done this

00:35:38,403 --> 00:35:41,106
is the market is actually
very small for spiced honey?

00:35:41,106 --> 00:35:44,075
We need more, like,
consumer education.

00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:45,810
That's what a lot of this
will go towards

00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,445
because people need to know
what it is.

00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:48,947
It's not a sweetener.
It's a condiment.

00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:51,883
So, you want me to help educate
America about spices

00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:53,551
and garlic in honey when maybe
they don't want to know.

00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:54,986
See, the thing about Kevin --
He has no concept

00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,688
of opening up a new category
and creating a new business.

00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:57,956
He just wants to be
a vampire

00:35:57,956 --> 00:35:59,791
that sucks the money
out of other businesses.

00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:01,292
You know, you can say that,

00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:03,395
but the truth is,
I think I'm right.

00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:06,264
I don't think people want,
in a large scale,

00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:07,699
to buy honey with garlic in it

00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:09,868
or honey with jalapeño peppers
in it.
Then just go out.

00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:14,172
Do you have
your own website?
MILLER: Yes.

00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,707
Are you doing any type
of marketing

00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:17,108
to drive people
to your website?

00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:18,977
I go to food shows
a lot of the time.

00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:22,747
My first food show I went to
was national expo west.

00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:26,084
I went there, and afterwards
Wegmans called me.

00:36:26,084 --> 00:36:27,752
Are you in Wegmans?

00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:29,654
Yeah, I -- Wegmans has reordered
three times now.

00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:31,222
O'LEARY: So, Henry,
I look at it this way.

00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:34,693
This is a very small category,
so if this takes off,

00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:37,395
the big honey guys
can also add spices to honey.

00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:39,097
They already have
the shelf space,

00:36:39,097 --> 00:36:41,166
and they'll crush you
like the bee you are.

00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:42,567
Unfortunately, for you,

00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:45,103
I'm the only shark that tells
the truth all of the time.

00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:49,207
You're about to hear everybody
give you lots of encouragement,

00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,476
but I don't think they're gonna
write you a check for $150,000.

00:36:51,476 --> 00:36:52,544
I'm out.

00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:55,146
All right. Thank you.

00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:56,781
What a nice guy.

00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:58,283
What's wrong
with encouragement?

00:36:58,283 --> 00:37:00,218
If you're encouraging him
to pursue something

00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,554
that will never make him money,
you're actually the devil.

00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:06,224
[laughs] We all know
where you're from.

00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,358
Hey, I tell the truth.

00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:09,260
I am the angel on his shoulder.

00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:14,933
I think it's great
that you are enterprising,

00:37:14,933 --> 00:37:18,470
that you are caring about bees
and our ecology.

00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:22,707
But my personal opinion is
it's very difficult

00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:26,644
to sell something spicy
like this with honey

00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:29,214
when I think most people

00:37:29,214 --> 00:37:31,683
probably do like
just plain honey.

00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:32,784
Mm.

00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:34,819
So, my opinion is

00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:37,756
this will be a hard --
a hard trek.

00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:41,192
I'm not sure I would get
back the $150,000,

00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:43,995
and so, for that reason,
I'm out.

00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:46,965
Okay.
Thank you for listening.

00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,102
Well, I find you
so adorable, Henry.

00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,437
You're almost irresistible.

00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,773
I think people are gonna
fall for you,

00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:57,475
and I think you shouldn't
get a partner here.

00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:59,911
I think you should go
and do some crowdfunding.

00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:01,246
You do your pitch online,

00:38:01,246 --> 00:38:03,381
you're gonna get all the money
you need.

00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:04,983
I'm out because I think
you have a long road,

00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:06,151
but I don't think
you need me,

00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:07,585
and I don't think
you need anybody here.

00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:11,956
Let me tell you
where I'm at.

00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,592
I mean, gosh, if there's a
business I know a lot about --

00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:16,928
I wish you, me, and my friend
could sit in a room

00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:18,797
'cause I'm fascinated
by this product.

00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,732
Robert, before you go out,
let me throw something by you.

00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,778
NARRATOR:
Three sharks are out,

00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:36,347
but Henry has two more chances
to make a deal.

00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:37,949
HERJAVEC: Let me tell you
where I'm at.

00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:40,685
I mean, gosh, if there's a
business I know a lot about --

00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:43,054
I wish you, me, and my friend
could sit in a room

00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:44,956
'cause I'm fascinated
by this product.

00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:47,192
Robert, before you go out,
let me throw something by you.

00:38:47,192 --> 00:38:50,762
Since you know this business,
all right,

00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:55,333
what if we upped the amount
and took majority ownership

00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:59,771
and took it over
and let him retain equity?

00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:01,573
Are you nuts?
All right, what amount?

00:39:01,573 --> 00:39:06,878
What if we gave them 300k
for 60%?

00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:08,913
And I've never, ever --
in every deal

00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:10,615
I've ever done
on "Shark Tank"

00:39:10,615 --> 00:39:12,951
even offered
to take a majority.

00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:14,319
To me,
that's always a negative.

00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:16,020
But in this --
So, why is this different?

00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,389
This is different because
you're creating a category,

00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:20,525
and you need pros
who are going to come in

00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:21,626
and fight the battle.

00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:23,595
We take that 300k.

00:39:23,595 --> 00:39:26,231
That way, you can take the 150k,
pay back your parents.

00:39:26,231 --> 00:39:28,700
Mark, why don't you just stick
your head in that beehive?

00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,767
It's easier.

00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:30,802
Yeah.
[laughs]

00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:32,770
You know, Kevin,
that's the thing.

00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,606
That's the difference
between us, Kevin.

00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:37,108
I see an idea,
I see an opportunity,

00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:40,111
and I can see the endgame
and how it can be enormous.

00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:42,146
HERJAVEC: Mark,
it's an interesting angle,

00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:44,749
but I don't think your pricing
enough of the risk at 60%.

00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:48,853
Let's do the $300,000
for 75%.

00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:51,789
Now who's the vampire?

00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,392
This could be
something big.

00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,929
$300,000 for 75%.

00:39:57,929 --> 00:40:00,865
$150,000 each
from Mark and I.

00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:02,734
[sighs]

00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,168
There's no way
you would consider

00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:05,670
anything less
than majority share?

00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,739
T-the thing about it is

00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:10,875
we want the ability to just
take this and run with it.

00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:11,910
I get that.

00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,278
One of the challenges
in "Shark Tank"

00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:14,545
is we invest in companies --

00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:16,080
at least, that I've learned
over the years,

00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,715
is when it's family-run,

00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:20,118
there's a lot
of unique dynamics.

00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:23,421
And it's very difficult
to just say, "Go, go, go,"

00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:27,125
which is what you want when
you've just invested $150,000

00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:29,193
and you see
the opportunity.

00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:31,029
You're still a kid, but
let me tell you something.

00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:33,965
When we get this serious
about it, money sees no age.

00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:37,135
It's real money.
It's real serious.

00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:38,903
Henry, it's your business,
so this is a serious thing.

00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:40,004
It's a big thing.

00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:41,539
I-if you want to make
a phone call --

00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:43,574
MILLER:
I'm not gonna consult my parents

00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:45,743
because they told me,
"This is your company.

00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:48,146
"Even though it's our money,
you started this thing.

00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:49,314
This is your baby."

00:40:49,314 --> 00:40:51,449
Look, Henry, I don't want
to sugar-coat this

00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,384
and try to talk you
into anything.

00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:55,720
I want to be brutally honest
on this, right?

00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,822
Because it's
a new category --

00:40:57,822 --> 00:40:59,757
It's really hard
to start new categories.

00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:00,758
1,000 nos.

00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:03,328
If you want to go into it
and own it

00:41:03,328 --> 00:41:07,165
and develop this yourself,
absolutely,

00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:08,633
if that's the dream
and that's the goal,

00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:10,468
then that's exactly
what you should stick to,

00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,669
and you should say no.

00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:13,838
And so, I don't -- I'm not
here to talk you into it.

00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:15,440
I'm here to give you
an alternative.

00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:20,645
Henry, $300,000 for 75%
from Mark and I.

00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,647
What would you like
to do?

00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:28,786
If I may, I think I'm going to
consult the bees on this one.

00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:30,588
[laughter]

00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:33,791
[bees buzzing]

00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:36,127
I think they said yes.

00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:38,062
There you go.
All right.

00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:40,131
HERJAVEC: Very interesting.
Congrats, man.

00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:42,300
Oh, thank you.
It'll be awesome.

00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,868
Well done there.
Thank you so much.

00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:44,836
Well thought out.

00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:45,870
We'll make it all work.
Yeah.

00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:46,804
We'll make it all work.
Thank you.

00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,306
GREINER: Good luck.

00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:49,374
Thank you.

00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,510
Whoo!

00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,680
Um, Robert and Mark
both went in,

00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,684
and they -- they offered
$300,000 for 75%.

00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:02,353
To pay my parents back
just means the world to me.

00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,955
They have just believed in me.

00:42:03,955 --> 00:42:08,893
Like, who invests $150,000
into a 12-year-old at the time?

00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:11,529
Like, seriously, who does that?
Crazy people.

00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,966
$150,000 of that 300k
is gonna go straight back

00:42:14,966 --> 00:42:16,567
to refunding you guys.

00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:20,104
I really think
it's a great deal.

00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:21,839
[sniffles]
[crying] Honey.

00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,475
Was that a pun?

00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:26,077
[laughs]
