00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:03,437
NARRATOR:
Tonight on "Shark Tank"...

00:00:03,437 --> 00:00:06,006
Things get even more heated
when the men take on the women.

00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,141
The difference between us
and the girls

00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:10,944
is that I actually own
businesses that I can
place orders for.

00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:12,079
Are you sick?

00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:14,615
Why is it every time
there's a female product

00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:16,950
on this show,
you guys go out right away?

00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,485
No, it's -- that's crap.

00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:20,821
NARRATOR: In the tank,
hopeful entrepreneurs

00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:23,557
get a once-in-a-lifetime chance
to pitch the sharks

00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:25,225
in hopes
of getting an investment

00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:27,427
to start, grow,
or save their businesses.

00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:29,129
[ laughter ]
No!

00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,098
The entrepreneurs
must convince a shark

00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:32,900
to invest the full amount
they're asking for,

00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,269
or they'll walk away
with nothing.

00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:37,037
This is fraudulent behavior.

00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,505
Listen, you're just taking
the guy down

00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:39,873
and making him feel
like he can't do this.

00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,108
I'm not finished
taking him down!

00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:43,677
NARRATOR: If the sharks hear
a great idea...

00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:44,645
What was your profit?

00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:46,780
$2.65 million.
You're killing it!

00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,850
NARRATOR: ...They're ready
to invest using their own money.

00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,251
And they're willing
to fight each other

00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:52,686
for a piece of the action.

00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:54,154
I'll take that deal.
Wait. We didn't hear it.

00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:55,689
I'm a big guy.
Whoa, whoa!

00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:58,492
Do we have a deal?
Wait. You know the histories
of Barb and I.

00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:01,194
It's never gonna go
into retail.
How insulting!

00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:03,230
Barb, want to go in with me?
O'LEARY:
If 30% is available --

00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,065
no problem at all, baby.
I'm right there with you.
okay.

00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,300
It is a guy thing.
I love it.

00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,602
You need to say yes
now to us.

00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:09,770
What the hell is this?!

00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:10,771
You're just
in a lousy mood today.

00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:12,539
Don't turn your back
in the tank.

00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:15,943
NARRATOR:
Who are the sharks?

00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,480
They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors

00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,016
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.

00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,719
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist

00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:28,121
who turned a $10,000 loan

00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:32,726
into a software business
worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:37,230
Barbara Corcoran went
from waiting tables in Manhattan

00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,900
to building the city's
preeminent real-estate empire.

00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:44,438
Robert Herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,

00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,306
is now a technology mogul

00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:50,844
who sold his first internet
companies for over $350 million.

00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,348
Lori Greiner, the queen of QVC,

00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:58,418
holds over 100 patents and
has launched over 300 products,

00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:02,222
grossing over a half a billion
dollars in retail sales.

00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:04,257
And Mark Cuban,

00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,193
notorious billionaire
entrepreneur, tech guru,

00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:20,440
and the outspoken owner
of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.

00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,377
First into the tank
is a dynamic product

00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:26,046
designed to help businesses
attract customers.

00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,854
Hi, sharks.
I'm Scott Adams.

00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:35,589
Hi, sharks.
I'm Josh Faherty.

00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:37,758
And we're from Sacramento,
California.

00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:40,327
We are the inventors
of Velocity Signs.

00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,796
We are seeking $225,000

00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:46,099
in exchange for 15% equity stake
in our business.

00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,869
One day, I was working
in Los Angeles,

00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:51,605
driving to a client meeting,
and it was 110 degrees outside.

00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:55,375
I looked over on the corner
and saw a poor guy

00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,378
waving a sign around,
dripping sweat.

00:02:58,378 --> 00:02:59,279
His shirt was wet.

00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,414
Then he rested
in a shaded area

00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:03,283
with his sign facedown.

00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,818
My first thought was,
"poor guy!

00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:06,386
He's gonna die
of heat exhaustion."

00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:09,489
My second thought -- "There's
got to be a better way."

00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,758
That's when we launched
Velocity Signs.

00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:14,127
[ laughter ]

00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:16,596
Portable, rechargeable,
interchangeable,

00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,865
self-standing,
and most importantly,

00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,034
they're made to grab
your attention

00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,536
with its unique movement.

00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,237
Sharks,
invest in Velocity Signs.

00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:27,107
Help us shake our way into every
business all over the world

00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:29,609
and put some velocity
back in the American economy.

00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:32,746
Do you guys got, like,
a B.B. gun or something?

00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:34,448
It's like we're at the arcade.
Bam, bam.

00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:37,217
[ laughter ]
Down goes Kevin.

00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,453
You're the guy that
looks like something
out of a horror movie.

00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,154
[ laughing ] Hey!

00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,256
How substantial are they? Are
they on their feet s-securely?

00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:44,558
ADAMS: Good question.

00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,627
They're 165 pounds, so it's
really hard to tip them over.

00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:48,729
So, how much
does this cost?

00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,565
From $18.99 all the way
up to $2,850.

00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:52,599
And how many
have you sold?

00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,935
We've sold 125
over the last 12 months.

00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:57,404
That's all, huh?

00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,239
125 a year.

00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,209
So, about $257,000
for over 12 months.

00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:03,944
And what -- what's your cost
on a typical --

00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:05,145
the Cuban's gonna cost you

00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,347
about -- about $1,000
cost of goods sold.

00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,482
To you.

00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:10,283
To -- to make it, for me.
Correct.
Oh, okay.

00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:12,252
How effective
h-have you found

00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,154
these are
for your customers?

00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:15,756
What do they tell you back?

00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:19,626
On average, our clients get
a 15% return on investment.

00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:20,794
CUBAN:
What kind of clients?

00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,996
Our biggest client right now
is little Caesars,

00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:26,333
who's got 3,560 locations
worldwide

00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,667
in 50 different countries.

00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:30,871
How many days do I have
to pay a student

00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:33,774
to spin signs before I pay
for one of these?

00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:37,611
I think the best analogy is
that our machines run nonstop,

00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,180
so you're getting full use
out of these machines

00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,916
versus human sign-spinners,
who have to take breaks.

00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,785
They, uh --
they're hard to manage.

00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,787
They get tired.
They walk off on the job.
I hate those humans.

00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,822
The turnover's
extremely high.
GREINER: You know what?
I'll tell you something else.

00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:50,257
I always feel sorry
for them.
CORCORAN: Yes.

00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:51,558
They have a job, Lori!

00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:52,759
ADAMS:
We're creating jobs.

00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,728
If you -- you can have
that employee

00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:56,296
that you run out
waving the sign

00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,365
move in and do some
more productive work
for your business,

00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,033
because you're gonna save money

00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,502
by hiring
that st-- human sign-spinner,

00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:05,205
but you're also gonna increase
sales by an average of 15%.

00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:06,706
That's $90,000 in new revenue

00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,542
you can put
to hiring new people.

00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:09,843
Well, that's
a decent answer.

00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:11,211
So they'll be displaced.
Okay.

00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:12,712
They'll be -- they'll be hired
in other positions

00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:13,980
that businesses
are gonna be hiring for.

00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,116
You're a good salesman,
Scott.
Thank you.

00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:18,185
What do you want to do
with the money?

00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:20,020
What's the world-domination
plan?

00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:24,057
We are gonna sell 1,200 units
over the next 12 months.

00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,725
We're gonna hire
eight sales reps,

00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,861
and we're gonna hire
four administrative staff.

00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:30,263
The other challenge
has been --

00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:33,133
I think it's clever, but I
invested in a billboard company

00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:34,668
many, many,
many years ago,

00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,937
and we deal with the --
the electronic signage,

00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:38,972
and it was a horrible,
miserable failure.

00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,173
I'm sorry to hear that.

00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,909
Now, one thing we found is
that the consumer

00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:46,813
gets very old very quickly
with the movement,

00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,281
and then it needs
to be changed.

00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,950
Right.

00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,586
Not a big fan of this business,
so I'm out.

00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:53,820
Okay. Robert.

00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:55,722
[ laughs ]
GREINER: Cut him off?

00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,357
No! No!
Gonna turn it off.

00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,159
[ laughter ]

00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,961
Smart.
O'LEARY: I love it.

00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:03,396
You never told us how much,
on your own forecast,

00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:04,965
you think you're going to make
next year.

00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:07,901
In very conservative
numbers,

00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:10,270
we're gonna
bring in $2.5 million

00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,505
and bring in $500,000
in sales.

00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:15,675
I would like to see a year
or two worth of sales

00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,444
so that we can see
what the real number is.

00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:20,814
My expectation is it'll be
a lot less than you think.

00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:23,617
I'm saying I don't know,
so I'm out.

00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:25,118
Thank you. Cut it.

00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,720
[ laughter ]

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,121
Thank God!

00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,623
CUBAN:
I like the business.

00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:34,127
The problem is that once you
get one, you don't need two.

00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,896
I'm out.

00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,130
Scott, he's out.
Turn him off.

00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,231
I'm out. Turn me off.

00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,966
ADAMS: Barbara? Lori?

00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,768
I was thinking about
the franchises I owned

00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:42,769
of real-estate brokers.

00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,271
What a natural audience
for this.

00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:46,339
Absolutely.
They pull it out of the back
of their car,

00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,174
and they put it
for an open-house sign...

00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:51,211
Oh, wow. Absolutely.
...That nobody even wants
to ever go to anymore,

00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:52,879
'cause they're tired of seeing
the signs.

00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,181
And, by the way, why does she
look so much prettier than me?

00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,650
I'm really pissed over that.
[ laughter ]

00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,385
and -- and -- but here's
the problem

00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:00,587
with even
the real-estate franchisees

00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,689
or the individual brokers
or agents.

00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:06,626
165 pounds out of the trunk
of their car to move it.

00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:09,229
So even that perfect
application is filled with --

00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:10,230
we didn't tell you
about a new product

00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,364
we've been working on,
as well.

00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,700
It stakes in the ground
for real-estate agents.

00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,535
And then it wiggles.
Smaller battery used
for a short --

00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:16,770
because open houses
are all day long.

00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,204
Why didn't you say it?
Why didn't you tell us about it?

00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:19,639
That's a better product.

00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,640
But you don't have it yet,

00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,908
so I wish I could see
that product.

00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,543
Mm-hmm.
If that were the case,
I'd be in.

00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:24,678
But I'm sorry.
I'm out.

00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,616
But would you --
don't turn me off.

00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:30,717
Get rid of Lori.

00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:31,751
I'm really annoyed

00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,386
that she's looking
so good up there.

00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,322
Turn her off!
You don't -- you don't have
to turn Barbara off.

00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:37,557
FAHERTY: Sorry, Barbara.
Just throw a bucket of water
on her. She'll melt.

00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:39,359
GREINER: Don't turn Lori off!
She's the only one left!

00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:40,760
ADAMS: Lori.
[ laughter ]

00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,562
first of all, I like --

00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:44,164
you sell a ton of these
on QVC?

00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:45,799
[ laughs ]
No.

00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,134
CORCORAN: No way, Jose.
But I sell a lot
of other places than QVC.

00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,871
I think that this is
an extremely smart new way

00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:55,442
to draw attention to
brick-and-mortar retail stores

00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:57,877
that are on the street
that are hurting right now,

00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,779
and I think retailers
are going to really love this.

00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,248
I also like that you'll be
helping these smaller businesses

00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:05,385
keep their jobs
and keep their stores.

00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:11,124
So I'll offer you $225,000
for 30% of your business.

00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:14,761
And, hopefully, together,

00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:17,097
we can get this really big and
really out there everywhere,

00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:19,199
'cause every franchise
needs this.

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,834
I -- we definitely see a value

00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,869
in your support
and your experience.

00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,104
O'LEARY:
I'll tell you what.

00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:25,205
If you take that deal,

00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:26,840
and Lori will have me,
I'll come in on it.

00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,242
I like it at that valuation.
I'll come in if you want.

00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,578
I'll come in as a third.
What just happened?!

00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:34,547
What just happened?

00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,624
NARRATOR:
Four sharks were out,

00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:45,725
but after Lori
expresses interest,

00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,927
Kevin and Mark
want a piece of the action.

00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,195
What just happened?!
What just happened?

00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,264
ADAMS: So, would that be
10% for Mark,

00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,400
10% for you,
and 10% for Lori?

00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,969
Yeah. We'd do that deal,
if Lori says yes.
CUBAN: Yeah.

00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:57,637
Are you okay
with that, Lori?

00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:00,006
Okay.
So, I made the offer.

00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,574
O'LEARY: I could sell
a lot of these.

00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:03,777
I said $225,000
at 30%, and --

00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:05,578
or better yet,
Robert, Kevin, and I

00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,747
could go in together
if she doesn't like it.

00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:10,750
I'm good with that.
And --

00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,085
oh, yeah?
then I'll go in with Lori.

00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:13,586
Wait!
Who believed in you?
No problem.

00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:14,854
ADAMS: That's
a good point, Lori.

00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:16,656
And who were all the lovely,
little sharks that said,

00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:19,559
"I don't believe in you,"
and they dropped out?

00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,027
O'LEARY: You know what?
I changed my mind.

00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:22,295
Instead,
because they're that way --
nobody said that!

00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,197
I -- Barb, want to go in
with me?

00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:27,167
If 30% is available --
no problem at all, baby.
I'm right there with you.

00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,701
Okay, guys, Barbara and I,

00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:33,873
we're going in together,
$225,000 at 25%?

00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:36,609
O'LEARY: Here's our deal.

00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,745
You get three sharks for 30% --
10% each.

00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,247
We have so many businesses
we can apply this to,

00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,716
so many contacts
we can phone for you.

00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:45,485
Oh, please.
We will set you on fire.

00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:47,020
You guys know
whose history --

00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,589
you know the histories
of Barb and I.

00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,291
This is not a QVC product!
You know what we've done.

00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,993
Three is always better than two.
Any math will tell you that.

00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,729
No, and the only reason
they jumped back in

00:09:56,729 --> 00:10:00,967
is because I said what I said
about believing in you...
absolutely.

00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,436
...And bringing back retailers
and life in America.

00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,105
What's your offer, Lori?

00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:09,342
What's your offer?!
So Barb and I are
at $225,000 for 25%.

00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,744
Both of us are offering $2--
for 25%.

00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:15,248
Three sharks versus two.
We can make a lot of calls.

00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:16,950
Are you guys willing
to come down to 25%?

00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,085
Oh, forget them!
I don't think so.

00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,154
We add so much extra value.
CUBAN: Well, here -- here's the
other thing I'll throw in.

00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:23,723
The difference between us
and the girls

00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:26,526
is that I actually own
businesses that I can
place orders for.

00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:27,994
Are you sick?
What business do you own?

00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,029
We own a lot of businesses!
I can place orders.

00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,664
How do you know
what Barb and I own?

00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,133
I can place orders.
CORCORAN:
I'm in real estate,

00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,767
and let me tell you what
I'll throw into the deal.
that's right.

00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:37,403
I'm the most influential
real-estate broker

00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,538
in the country,

00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:40,840
the most visible,
the most influential.

00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,442
I'll be your front man
and make sure

00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:44,611
every real-estate broker
in America considers
buying these signs.

00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:47,714
I'll get it in front of them.
Scott, you know what Barbara
will do for you?

00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:50,984
O'LEARY: Scott,
she works for me!
She'll sell you your mansion
once we make a lot of money.

00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,252
But you need to say yes
now to us.
GREINER: Ugh.

00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:54,821
I really am not comfortable
with you debating this,

00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,323
because it's so much better
an offer from --

00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,958
I'm -- I'm gonna order
at least five of them.

00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,693
Five of them?! What a joke.
Five of them?!

00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:01,961
That's just me ordering five
just right off the top.

00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,563
And I'm gonna sell
probably 50,000 of them

00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:05,498
within 6 months.
well, that's -- I'll look at it
for naked pizza.

00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,799
I'll definitely buy it
for the mavs.

00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,701
'cause what'll happen is if I
put it in front of the arena

00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,470
with a dirk head up there,
it's gonna become a landmark.

00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,172
People are gonna come
and take their pictures with it

00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,007
and post it everywhere.

00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,475
GREINER:
I have relationships

00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:18,111
with some of the major retailers
in our country,

00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:20,480
and some of them
have 3,500 stores, so...

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,115
CORCORAN: And Mark is talking
about five signs.

00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:23,516
Who are the --
who are those retailers?

00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,652
Walmart. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.
Walgreens.

00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:27,187
We all work
with the same retailers.
O'LEARY: Come on!

00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,055
Mine are bigger,
and mine have done more.

00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,191
You don't think they return
our calls? Are you kidding?

00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:34,327
What do you want to do?
Now's the time to decide.

00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:35,428
What are you gonna do,
Scott?

00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,930
Absolutely.

00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,465
Well, so, we see a value in all
five of you, just so you know.

00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,467
We appreciate it.

00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:44,137
Um, we definitely see a value
in -- in mass quantity

00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:46,573
and having three sharks
versus two sharks.

00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:49,042
Guys, are you willing
to come down to 25%?

00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,110
Can't do it.
No.

00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:54,480
Are you sure?

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,715
Absolutely.
Yep.

00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,584
We bring so much value.
We don't go at a discount.

00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:59,419
Barb, how do you feel
about that?

00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:01,321
There are three of us.
We need a -- we need a
bigger number.

00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:02,822
If you want to know,
if you ask one more time,
I'm gonna go out.

00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,324
That's right.
That is so insulting.

00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,597
Okay.
Uh, we appreciate it.

00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:12,298
We think there's more value
en masse,

00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,934
so we're gonna go ahead and go
with Mark, Kevin, and Robert.

00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:17,470
Yes, sir!
All right!

00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,738
GREINER: That was horrible.
How insulting!

00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,474
That was horrible.
[ indistinct conversations ]

00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,476
look at that. look at us.
what kills me is...

00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:26,112
I'm excited.
...None of the three of you
even wanted this.

00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,881
ADAMS: Looking forward
to working with you.

00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:30,883
I said I wanted it.
HERJAVEC: Kevin,
this is an extra-large.

00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,885
Then all of a sudden,
you all wanted it.
This must be yours.

00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,754
Lori, I can't thank you enough.
We really appreciate it.

00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,390
Without you, this wouldn't
have happened.

00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,959
I wanted to work with you.
I really did.

00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,162
I just saw a value in working
with three versus two.

00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:45,465
It wasn't a male
versus female.
It definitely was!

00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,400
It is a guy thing.
I love it.

00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,235
Man it up!
You know, I'm not gonna let
any woman in America

00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:51,170
ever buy a sign
from them.
yeah.

00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,905
That's right. Women --
I'm gonna start a campaign.

00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,173
How insulting!

00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,352
NARRATOR: Next into the tank

00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,621
is a re-imagined
favorite snack food.

00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:19,732
Hello, sharks.

00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,235
My name is Sanjiv Patel
from Dallas, Texas,

00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:25,571
and my product is
Lord Nut Levington Peanuts.

00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:28,808
I'm here today
seeking $500,000

00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,045
in exchange for 30%
of my company.

00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:34,247
So, a bit
about this handsome chap.

00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:36,482
Who is Lord nut levington?

00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,852
Urban legend has it that
Lord nut hails from blighty,

00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:43,556
an unsavory land far, far away
across the great pond,

00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:46,559
known for its extreme blandness
and lack of flavor.

00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,428
When he could stand it
no longer,

00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:52,031
Lord nut decided upon
a self-imposed exile

00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:54,400
and set out for the exciting,
new world in search of flavor.

00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,603
Later, Lord nut found
his true calling in life --

00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:58,971
to fight bland where it hides

00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,574
and bring freedom of flavor
to the masses.

00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:04,143
But before I go on any further,
please take a moment,

00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,845
tickle your taste buds,

00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,814
and try some
of our highly seasoned peanuts.

00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:08,815
HERJAVEC:
[ chuckles ]

00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:09,716
hi, Robert.
if you'd just grab

00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:11,417
one of those trays
there...

00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:12,485
Oh, thank you, Sanjiv.
...That would be great --
you're welcome.

00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:13,553
Yeah.

00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:15,188
Here, Lori.
Just grab...

00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,622
Okay. Wow.

00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,024
Thank you for that.
You're welcome.

00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,426
These have a kick to them,
Sanjiv.
Yes, thank you.

00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:21,828
Which one did you try?

00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:23,296
I tried the El --
cheddarales.

00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:25,064
Yeah.

00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:27,533
[ chuckles ]
Wow. Ah! Spicy!

00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,136
O'LEARY: Can I ask you
just a basic question?
Sure.

00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:32,105
$500,000 for 30%
imputes a value

00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:35,408
of close to $1 1/2 million,
or just over, actually.
yes.

00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:36,843
So you must have
some great sales
and distribution, right?

00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:38,678
We have some sales, yes.

00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:40,780
I launched the brand
in April of 2011.

00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,348
As of the end of last month,

00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:45,084
we've made $700,000
in sales...

00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:48,187
Wow.
...Which is the equivalent
of 300,000 cans of peanuts.

00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:50,757
What were your sales
last year, Sanjiv?

00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:53,426
So, as of the last 12 months,
it's $300,000.

00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:54,494
We had some -- it should --
it's flat.

00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:55,928
Well, when we started
this company,

00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,997
we had a couple of big-box
retailers, the discount stores,

00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,632
that just bought a ton
of product, right?

00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:02,335
Okay.
So, you know, it -- it skews
the figures earlier higher.

00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:04,637
Now you're normalizing sales
at how much a year?

00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,038
We're gonna end this year
at about $350,000.

00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:07,407
That's where I'm shooting for,
gross sales.

00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,674
Okay. How much you gonna make
on the $350,000?

00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:09,876
We won't make money
this year.

00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:15,281
So, why would you be worth
$1 1/2 million?

00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:16,883
Because, with -- with
half a million dollars

00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:18,050
from the sharks, right,
so...

00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,352
Yeah, but -- but hang on.
Hang on.

00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:20,820
You have a commodity
in peanuts.

00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,856
I can buy peanuts.
I can flavor peanuts.
I can dry-roast peanuts.

00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,725
PATEL: That's the piece
you're buying into.
The only thing of value here
is the brand!

00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:28,828
Um, well --
I'm never heard of Mr.
"pardon my flavor" nut bar.

00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:30,830
Lord levington.
Lord levington.
What's his name?

00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,098
GREINER: Levington.
Lord nut.

00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,166
I don't know who this guy is,

00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,567
and the rest of America
doesn't, either.

00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:35,668
But we're gonna get there.
Really?

00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:36,803
And we're on our way. Yes.

00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:37,904
CUBAN: So, what are you
doing to get there?

00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:39,739
So, why do you say
that you're on your way?

00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:41,641
Currently, we're in
about 600 stores across the U.S.

00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:44,110
What kind of stores?
Mainly down
the middle of America.

00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,379
We're in Wegmans
in the Northeast.
Great company.

00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:49,248
We just got into --
well, earlier this year --
into h-e-b in south Texas.

00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,617
And have they reordered?
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,919
How much have you invested?

00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,454
Get ready. $1.1 million.

00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,988
GREINER: Wow.
Wow!

00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,690
HERJAVEC: Where did you
get the $1.1 million,

00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,525
if you can legally
tell me?

00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,194
So -- [ laughs ]
I can legally tell you.

00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:02,428
[ chuckles ]

00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,963
I came over to the U.S.,

00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,699
did my M.B.A. at Babson College
in Boston,

00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,734
known for entrepreneurship.
it's a great school.

00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,670
When I graduated, I joined

00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,940
what was then a fledgling
pita chip company,

00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,074
Stacy's pita chip company,

00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,576
and I was in charge
of the money.

00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:18,211
That's
a very strong brand.
When I -- it is now.

00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:20,079
When I joined, we were
about $2 million in sales.

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,814
In that journey,
you must remember the days

00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,417
when you were trying to
get permanent shelf space
for that brand.

00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:26,185
Yes.

00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,354
It's so prohibitive in a
commodity like peanuts or snacks

00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:29,522
to get space and keep it,

00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:31,257
that you have to have scale
to remain profitable.

00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:33,192
You are going to have
to replace

00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:35,995
some linear footage
in major retailers...

00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,298
Yes.
...Against a guy
that has 80% of the market.

00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:42,502
In fact, in our industry,
it is very common

00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:46,873
that entrepreneurs,
people like me, create brands.

00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:49,008
It is the role
of the multinationals,

00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,878
the larger companies,
to then scale those brands.

00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:55,615
That's why we have a thriving
food entrepreneurial industry...

00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:56,916
Well said.
...That creates products --

00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,651
but you have to survive
until you have a --

00:16:58,651 --> 00:16:59,952
Sanjiv,
that's a great answer.

00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:00,987
I'm right here.
Where am I going?

00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:02,755
I'm alive. I'm surviving.

00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,625
Yeah, but can you give me
an operator in the peanut space

00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,627
in the last 10 years
that has survived

00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:09,629
the slaughter fest
from the big guys?

00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,664
Why does it have
to be in peanuts? Any
small-food business.

00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:12,965
What the hell is this?!
Any small-food business.

00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,534
PATEL: Just because it
hasn't happened,

00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,769
do you lose faith in
everything happening
from here forward?

00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,704
Yes, I lose faith!
He loses faith
in everything.

00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,106
You're a financial guy.
You're a financial guy.
You know what?

00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:21,040
Of course
I'm a financial guy!
Doesn't it say --

00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,508
doesn't it say past results

00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:23,910
are no reflection
of future performance?

00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,511
Isn't that right?

00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:26,746
I also say
don't be an idiot

00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:28,047
and invest
where you can't win.

00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,550
How about
my pork barrel bbq guys?

00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,684
Yes.

00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:34,954
They were
at $500,000 in sales.

00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:36,656
It took them a year and a half
to get there,

00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:37,757
and then it caught fire,

00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:39,992
and now they're over $2 million
in sales.

00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:40,893
Yeah.
And you know why?

00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,461
Every doomsdayer
that said to them

00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:43,696
they wouldn't do it,
they ignored,

00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:45,431
like this character
over here.

00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:46,933
You're doing it
in barbecue sauce.
GREINER:
And you know what?

00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:48,367
It's just the same
as peanuts?

00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:49,468
Listen, you're just taking
the guy down

00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:50,503
and making him feel
like he can't do this.

00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:51,771
I'm not finished
taking him down!

00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:57,043
I can't follow you down
this path to hell,

00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:58,578
and I won't do it.

00:17:58,578 --> 00:17:59,545
I'm out.

00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:02,415
I respect that. Thank you.

00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,352
Sanjiv,
I have a question.

00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:08,621
Yes.
You didn't, uh,
mention earlier

00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:09,755
how you developed
all these flavors.

00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,856
Yeah.
Did you cook them up
yourself?

00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,224
Yeah, I'm not a cook.
I'm not a chef.

00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:14,160
I can't mix things up and say,
"here's a great recipe."

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,761
you know, that's the missing
piece for me --

00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,029
passion for the product.

00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,298
I almost feel like you're
a left-brain --

00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:21,400
how could you not hear
the passion for the product?
he's got it all over.

00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,235
CORCORAN: He's got cute names,
but I haven't heard

00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:24,870
any love of your peanuts
from you at all.

00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:28,341
Forgive me, but every
food business I've
gotten involved in...
Well --

00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:30,843
...that was front and center,
and I'm not getting it.

00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:31,744
I'm out.

00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:37,016
So...Here's my feeling.

00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:38,718
I couldn't try
your peanuts,

00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:40,286
because peanuts
don't agree with me.
oh.

00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,855
Because I can't even eat
your product

00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,423
or even try it,
I'm out.

00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:46,092
I understand. Thank you.

00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:48,427
So, Sanjiv, I love --

00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:52,465
unlike Kevin, I really like
disruptive technologies.

00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:53,599
So I have no problem

00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,967
with the market
that you're going into.

00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,202
Mm.

00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:58,337
But I didn't hear
the plan.

00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,272
I didn't hear anything
that makes me want

00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,775
to spend
half a million dollars

00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:06,178
to help you build the brand
going forward.

00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,880
I-I got to be out.

00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,087
CUBAN:
Sanjiv, here's my problem.

00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:18,891
What you haven't talked to
is sales velocity, right?

00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,359
Yes.

00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,394
Here's your chance right now
to tell me

00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:22,395
here's why they're flying off
the shelves,

00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:24,063
or here's why they will,

00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:26,198
because that's the missing
piece, so tell me.

00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:28,701
We're bringing
a different shade of product

00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:31,337
into this category
with a fun, exciting brand

00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,439
that people
feel passionate about.

00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:34,874
There is no water-cooler
talk happening about
those other products.

00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:37,343
There's no water-cooler
talk talking about
Lord nut levington.

00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,679
Well, people get
quite -- people are excited
when they try our product.

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,148
That's -- see, now you went
from giving data

00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:45,751
to talk
and giving stories.

00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,753
I don't see it
as blowing out the doors,

00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:51,023
and I don't think this is enough
capital to correct mistakes.

00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:55,194
Your problem is sales not flying
off the shelf. I'm out.

00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,664
Okay. I respect that.
Thank you.

00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:01,400
Are we done?
Is that everyone?

00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,601
That's everyone.
We're done big-time.

00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,236
[ laughs ]
It's lovely to meet you.

00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,337
Good luck, Sanjiv.

00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:06,305
Thank you. Bye.

00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,074
Great guy.
Lovely man.

00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:13,479
PATEL: Great opportunity.
Loved being here.

00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:16,182
Now I'm gonna go out
there and fight bland
and sell some peanuts.

00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:17,817
That's what I count on.
I'm gonna give the guy
a ton of credit,

00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:21,153
because he came in
and kicked Kevin's butt.
yeah!

00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,556
He -- he did, and he does have
a passion and drive.
I don't know
about that, Mark.

00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,157
If I was wrong, Mark,
he would be covered in offers.

00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,992
And look. Oh, oh, oh!
He didn't get any offers!
CUBAN: But no, he --

00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,228
you're just in a lousy mood
today. it's terrible.

00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:38,204

with a product he believes

00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:45,678
is like a vacation
for your feet.

Hi. My name is Pat Yates.

00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,121
My company is Happy Feet,

00:20:55,121 --> 00:21:00,392
and I'm seeking $375,000
for 15% equity in my company.

00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,695
Happy feet are not
your grandma's slippers.

00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:04,230
They're playful, fun,

00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:07,299
and so comfortable, they're
like walking on pillows.

00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,802
They come in almost every color
imaginable,

00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:12,238
including our top-selling
leopard and zebra print,

00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:16,408
as well as the red, black, and
white collegiate-licensed design

00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:17,910
of my beloved
Louisville cardinals.

00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,078
Ha!

00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:21,113
[ laughter ]

00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,982
Also, don't forget about
our cool animal styles --

00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:27,386
lion, tiger, giraffe, and
the ever-tough shark slippers.

00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:30,256
Happy feet are great
for people of all ages.

00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:33,626
Now, sales are great,
but we need your help

00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,494
to expand
in our international markets

00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:36,829
as well as to take it
into retail.

00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:37,930
Now, which of you sharks

00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,832
is ready to take the walk
with Happy Feet?

00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:41,700
And I know you won't want
to take them off.

00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,502
Awesome. Yeah.
Bring them on.
GREINER: Good.

00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:45,204
All right, so, we're gonna do it
a little different.

00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:46,372
I know
where that pair is going.
Mark, you're an athlete,
a basketball guy.

00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:47,439
Yeah, I know.
Basketball guy,
basketball guy.

00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:48,574
Go, hoosiers, baby.
There you go. All right.

00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:49,241
Go, hoosiers.
GREINER: [ laughs ]

00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:50,376
oh, come on, Mark.

00:21:50,376 --> 00:21:51,644
Go, hoosiers.
The hoosiers?

00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:54,246
Barbara, you got the leopard.
Grr. There you go.

00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:56,015
Got to catch it. Oh, see?
HERJAVEC: She's an animal.

00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:58,517
Doggone!
Give me another shot.
I -- but I threw it short,
though.

00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,052
[ sighs ] Too bad.

00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,821
For the shark
of all sharks, Mr. O'Leary.
O'LEARY: Hey! Love it.

00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,823
See, he can't catch,
either!

00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:06,091
All right, Lori.
You're gonna get the neon zebra.

00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:07,893
For you, Robert -- penguin.

00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:08,994
A penguin?!
What the hell is that?!

00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,229
I don't know! We came up
with an animal!

00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:12,298
It's just a cute animal!
What am I?!

00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:14,166
What am I,
the friggin' fluffy shark?!
I think about Canada,
I think of penguin.

00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,534
What's wrong with that?
Give me the lion.

00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:16,802
I don't want the penguin!

00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:18,804
You want the lion? Okay.
Hold on. Go ahead. Give it back.

00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:20,973
All right.
We'll get you the lion.
I think you'd look good
in a penguin, Robert.

00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:22,374
There we go.
Oh, my gosh.
These are my new shoes!

00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:23,776
All right!
YATES: There we go.

00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:25,544
These are amazing.
They're like moon boots.

00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:27,546
Absolutely.
They're like moon boots.
Exactly.

00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:29,081
CUBAN: I used to have
a pair of moon boots.

00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,216
Wow.
HERJAVEC:
They're so comfortable!

00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:32,351
Wow.
They really are.

00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,686
See? Look at that.
Wow.

00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,221
Look how good he looks
in those sharks.

00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:37,656
HERJAVEC: Wow. Why are these
so comfortable, pat?

00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:39,592
Well, it is -- it's that 1-inch
foam rubber bottom.

00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:41,327
It's a dense foam rubber
that we put in them.

00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:43,095
Just, the whole thing,
when you step down on it,

00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:45,231
it's like walking
on pillows.

00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:47,733
So, pat, $375,000 for 15%.

00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:50,936
Your sales must be amazing!

00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:53,505
We've done $6.5 million
in the last 3 years...

00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:55,441
You got to be kidding.

00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:57,076
...Between internet
and wholesale -- yes.

00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:58,978
HERJAVEC: What are your sales
last year?

00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:00,246
GREINER: What stores --
what stores are you in?
What are your sales
last year?

00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:01,881
Sales last year
were $2.65 million.

00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:04,350
And the year before?
Uh, $2.4 million.

00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:07,453
So, pat,
out of the $2.6 million,
what percentage is online?

00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:08,988
It's -- actually,
of that $2.6 million,

00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:10,389
it was probably
about $2.2 million,

00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,358
which is
the highest margin portion.

00:23:12,358 --> 00:23:15,294
You're selling that
much stuff online? Wow.
Wow.

00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:16,495
And what does it
cost you to make?

00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:18,330
The sneaker-slipper styles
cost about $5.50.

00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,933
We sell them $24.99 to $29.99,

00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:22,635
which is about a 400% markup
right there.

00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:24,436
That's a great margin.

00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:25,804
Pat, that $2.6 million
you sold last year --

00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:26,906
what was your profit
on that?

00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,274
About $600,000.

00:23:28,274 --> 00:23:29,808
So, where are you spending
all your money?

00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:33,045
Um...
Because with that big
of margins,

00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:34,980
you should be making
more than $600,000.

00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,982
We do a ton of free shipping
at our busiest time,

00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:39,485
which is holiday, which knocks
that margin down significantly.

00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:40,719
But the problem was, the margin

00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:42,254
and the seasonality
of the business

00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,790
being a little bit seasonal
in the winter,

00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,859
it's sort of shot down
some of those profits,
and I didn't have --

00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:48,627
why haven't you focused
on getting

00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:50,796
into major retail stores?

00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:52,364
Well, there are
several reasons.

00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:53,666
Okay.
Number one --
the size of the product.

00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,034
They were afraid
it was too big.
Exactly.

00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:57,436
O'LEARY: It takes up 2 1/2 times
the linear square feet

00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,438
that an ordinary shoe
would take.

00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,407
It is.
It's never gonna go
into retail.

00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:03,409
O'LEARY: I have
a different problem with it.

00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:04,710
You got to help me with this,

00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,912
'cause this is the thing
that's bugging me the most.

00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:09,615
There's nothing proprietary
about this stuff.

00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:12,117
I'm very worried
that someone else

00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:15,487
is gonna come in here
and drop the prices by 30%.

00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:16,922
Yeah.

00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:18,757
...Because I've never seen
margins like this in slippers.

00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:20,526
Like, this is incredible.

00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:22,695
Do you have competitors
that are doing the same thing?

00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:24,463
We -- we don't.
Anybody that you see

00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,832
selling these online
are buying from us.

00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:30,035
GREINER: How are people
knowing you're there?

00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:31,837
This is the thing
I want to understand,

00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,806
'cause you have
an amazing online business.

00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:36,542
We also did a license with a
girl who was on a reality show

00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:39,011
that really built a lot
of social following behind it

00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:40,913
that we still have, as well.
who?
Snooki.

00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:42,348
We utilized her Twitter account
as well as her social,

00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:43,882
to be able to grow it.
who is it?
was it Snooki?

00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:46,051
Another -- yeah.
[ chuckles ]

00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,720
and we ended up getting
onto a business

00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,555
where we could find
those mid-level social stars

00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:51,490
that would help get our name
out there and grow it.

00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,058
Are you saying
Snooki's mid-level?

00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:54,526
She was
when we found her.

00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:56,095
[ laughter ]
She won't like
that I said that.

00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:58,263
But she's fantastic.
Wow. Wow.

00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:01,200
And how much are you having
to pay for those folks?
Uh, it's about 12%.

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,969
Ah, therein lies --
that's where
the money's going.

00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:05,070
That's where the money --
it's not --
it's not all of it

00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,238
going to that,
though, Mark.
no, but --

00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:07,906
but it's actually fed
what we're growing.

00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:09,842
So we've really tried to create
our own marketing.

00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,510
That's really what I'm about.

00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,578
So, proprietary's important,

00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:13,946
but when you have
someone like me

00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:15,948
that's gonna go out and try
to market and work hard --

00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:17,383
pat, you're killing it!

00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:18,450
Well -- right!

00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,918
CORCORAN:
Pat, time out for a moment.

00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:22,955
There's something that's
really disturbing me.

00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:26,058
You know, it feels to me
as though you may have peaked

00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:28,594
or are maybe
even on the way down.

00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:31,864
But it feels to me you're not
going to get bigger. I'm out.

00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:37,669
I mean --
pat, look, you --
great business, right?

00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:39,505
I'm an intense entrepreneur,
Robert.

00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:41,473
Oh, my friend,
I get that from you.

00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:42,708
This is
a real business.

00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,076
Right.

00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:46,512
You've done
a fantastic job.

00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:49,548
Pat, I-I don't see
where I add value.
I like to add value.

00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,617
I'm a good operator,
just like you are.

00:25:51,617 --> 00:25:54,653
I like to run things.
I like to add value to people.

00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:55,988
I don't like to just write
a check to something.

00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:57,022
Let me ask you
one other question,

00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:58,424
one thing
I was gonna talk about.

00:25:58,424 --> 00:26:01,160
Look, I-I don't want you
to waste all your time with me.

00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,461
You're doing a great job.

00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:05,097
I don't want to write a check,
and that's it. I'm out.

00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:07,933
Thank you, Robert.
I understand.

00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:09,802
O'LEARY: How many pair
are you gonna sell this year?

00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:12,104
75,000 to 100,000.

00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:15,274
The challenge is,
15% is nothing, nothing to me.

00:26:15,274 --> 00:26:18,110
Right.
It just --
it's not exciting.

00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,378
I understand.

00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:21,180
But I understand partnering
with a shark

00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,115
isn't a bad thing
for this online business,

00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:26,318
because together, we could
probably sell a ton more.

00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:28,287
I'm gonna make you
an offer.

00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:32,691
I'll give you $375,000,

00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:37,096
and I want a $3 royalty
on every pair sold

00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,931
until I get
my $375,000 back.

00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:40,899
[ laughter ]

00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:42,468
Chimed right in.

00:26:42,468 --> 00:26:44,103
Let's see him
make an offer.

00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:45,337
He likes to make
a lot of noise

00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:46,872
but doesn't often make
an offer.
no, it just --

00:26:46,872 --> 00:26:52,578
I want a 5% -- as I like to say,
"wet my beak" -- equity,

00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:54,580
just so we can say
we're partners.

00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:58,817
And I'll -- after I recoup
my capital, I'll drop down
to $1.50.

00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:00,519
That's three times more
than Snooki got!

00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:03,455
Look. I love Snooki,
but you got Mr. Wonderful here.

00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,523
That's a whole
different ballgame.

00:27:04,523 --> 00:27:05,891
GREINER: I like it.

00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:08,994
I might offer to go in with
Kevin, if he would have me...

00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:14,600
If you can convince me,
because I like to go bigger.

00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,637
I think it would be great
if you could expand into retail.

00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,305
So, Lori, I just want
to confirm something.
Okay.

00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,441
You want to go 50/50
on the deal.
Yes.

00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:24,543
One modification
we have to make --

00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:26,812
I believe that decimals
are bad karma,

00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:28,914
so you have to go up to 6%
on the "wet your beak" equity.

00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:29,915
[ laughs ]

00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:32,284
So it's 3% each, okay?

00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:34,153
We give him $375,000.
We split that.

00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:37,523
And your one covenant is
that he attempt retail again.

00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:38,790
Yes.

00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,693
I am prepared to go on there
and Snooki it out.

00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,328
Snooki it out, huh?

00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,863
Well, who needs Snooki
when you got pookie?

00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:46,732
I think Mark should jump
all over this.

00:27:46,732 --> 00:27:49,401
Mark, I-I hope
that you see the passion.

00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:50,903
I mean, I've heard you talk
about entrepreneurs.

00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:52,404
And you sold garbage bags,
right?
Door to door.

00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:54,139
I have -- I have a story,
if you'd give me two minutes.
Sure.

00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:55,674
My mom passed away
a year and a half ago

00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:56,875
really kind of unexpectedly,

00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:58,610
and this was
her favorite story of me.

00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,312
I had a guy, a kid --

00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:02,281
when I was playing basketball
in the backyard with a kid,

00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:03,448
his dad was throwing
some calendars out.

00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:05,117
I looked at them.
They were last year's calendars.

00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:07,019
I took those, and I literally
walked my way home

00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:09,021
and sold every one
of those calendars.

00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,289
The retail
does have challenges,

00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:11,623
but I'm gonna get up
every day

00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:13,458
to make sure this business
continues to grow.

00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:14,860
You -- you do not
have to sell me.

00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,662
You are the real deal,
right?

00:28:16,662 --> 00:28:18,230
I appreciate that.

00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,365
You've got a great business,
but it's not a fit for me.

00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,034
I'm out.

00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:23,302
I appreciate that, Mark.
You're welcome.

00:28:23,302 --> 00:28:24,803
Thank you.
Well!

00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,238
GREINER: [ laughs ]

00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:28,106
pat, three sharks
are out now.

00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:30,876
All roads lead back.

00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:35,747
You know,
I-I-I really appreciate that.

00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:38,183
Um, I don't think it's
the right situation for me.

00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:44,690
I really appreciate
the offer, but...
Hallelujah.

00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:45,791
The only thing that I could do
is maybe counter back.

00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:47,092
I really want you all --

00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:48,160
what is your counter?

00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:01,473
NARRATOR:
Three sharks are out.

00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:03,976
Pat has an offer
from Kevin and Lori --

00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:07,879
$375,000 for a 6% stake,

00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:12,851
plus a $3 royalty
which drops to $1.50

00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:15,053
after the investment
is repaid,

00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:16,755
which pat feels
is too steep.

00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,457
What is your counter?

00:29:21,727 --> 00:29:25,464
I would be willing to do
$375,000 for 20%,

00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:29,501
to go into that and -- and have
you all help me grow it.

00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:32,104
I think that that is
a-a reasonable number.

00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,972
I --
you understand the value
of two sharks?

00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:34,973
Do you have any idea

00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:36,475
what's going to happen
to your sales?

00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:38,176
I -- 100%. I just don't like
the royalty structure.

00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,078
I would love to find a
percentage that you all
make sense.

00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:41,913
Okay, so you don't like
my royalty deal.

00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:43,615
If you want me to go
straight equity,

00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,018
that's gonna take me a lot
longer to get my money back,

00:29:46,018 --> 00:29:48,820
so I've got to increase
the amount I'm going to get.

00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,423
Here's the new offer --
and Lori may come in with me,

00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:53,492
as she did
on the royalty deal --

00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:55,894
$375,000 for 30%.

00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:58,597
I'll do that.
I'm in with you.

00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:02,701
I'll give you $375,000
for 30%.

00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:06,938
Wow.

00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:08,307
O'LEARY: Robert's jumped
back into this.

00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:10,509
He was out for a while,
but now he's offering you...

00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:12,244
Pat's selling me!

00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:14,446
...$375,000 for 30%,

00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:16,548
which was the exact same offer
that Lori and I gave you.

00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:19,851
The difference is you get
two sharks instead of one.

00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:21,086
Right.

00:30:21,086 --> 00:30:22,954
I think that if either one
of you would do 25%,

00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:24,423
that's gonna be my top end.

00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:28,593
Why would you take that, though?
Why would you do that?

00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:30,062
How much cash do you guys have
in the bank right now?

00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:32,030
Well, I mean,
we have $200,000.

00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,599
25%, $375,000.
O'LEARY: 25%?

00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:35,801
But I would like them
to be able to help

00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:36,835
with -- with where
we're headed.

00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:37,736
I don't know
that I can --

00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:39,571
pat, I'll take
that deal.

00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:41,273
Wait. We didn't hear it.
I'm a big guy.

00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:44,476
Whoa, whoa! Wait.
$375,000, 25%.

00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:45,977
Do we have a deal?
Wait.

00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:47,079
Done.

00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:49,114
Done! I like you, pat!
CORCORAN: Wow. Bam.

00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:50,549
Wham, bam,
thank you, Ma'am.
Great job!

00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:53,285
Well, we were talking.
We shouldn't have been talking.

00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:54,886
There you have it.
CORCORAN: Wow!

00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:56,922
That was
a great presentation.
Thank you.
Appreciate it, guys.

00:30:56,922 --> 00:30:58,423
Robert,
that was a great move!
CORCORAN: Wow, Robert.

00:30:58,423 --> 00:30:59,791
He sees us talking.

00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,460
You deserve to lose it.

00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,728
Don't turn your back
in the tank.

00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:03,795
Good job, Robert.

00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:04,796
Why, thank you, Mark.

00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:06,398
You can learn a thing or two
from me.

00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:07,432
I did on that one.

00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,235
YATES:
It was incredible, I mean,

00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:11,603
especially
to pull Robert back in

00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:13,705
after he had already gone
through it and said he was out.

00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,207
He saw my passion.
He saw my interest.

00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:17,809
And he's really a guy
that I had at the top of my list

00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,945
of who I wanted,
so I'm extremely excited.

00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,818
NARRATOR: Last season,
Byron young pitched the sharks

00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:29,454
his multifunctional
beanbag chair.

00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:30,822
There's a bed inside!

00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:33,091
And he struck a deal
with Lori Greiner.

00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:36,895
It's 58%, $200,000.
Take it or leave it.

00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,897
I came here to make a deal.
Let's do it.

00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,867
Let's see how Byron
and cordaroy's is doing now.

00:31:44,603 --> 00:31:46,838
YOUNG: I never expected
to go on "Shark Tank"

00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:48,974
and give up 58%
of my business.

00:31:48,974 --> 00:31:50,776
But since partnering with Lori,

00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:52,344
she has taken me to levels

00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:53,879
that I never even dreamed of.

00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:56,148
The orders came pouring in.

00:31:56,148 --> 00:32:00,419
In less than 8 months, we've
done over $3 million in sales.

00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,721
Those aren't projections.
Those are real numbers.

00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:07,392
This might just be the ultimate
gift this holiday season.

00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:09,961
We recently debuted
cordaroy's on QVC,

00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:11,963
and sales went
through the roof.

00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:14,566
We did
about $25,000 per minute,

00:32:14,566 --> 00:32:17,402
and we oversold our inventory
by 50%.

00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:19,771
They slapped us
with a big "sold out" sign,

00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,373
and it was the best night
of my life.

00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:23,942
Hi, Byron!
Hey, Lori!

00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,011
Working with Lori Greiner
has been amazing.

00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:27,846
It seems like
she never stops working,

00:32:27,846 --> 00:32:29,481
yet she always answers
the phone.

00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:30,916
She's the perfect
business partner.

00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:32,451
I have great news
  for you today.

00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:35,220
We just got another order
  for half a million dollars!

00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,321
Holy cow!
  yeah!

00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:37,823
Roll up your sleeves,

00:32:37,823 --> 00:32:39,891
because you're gonna be
  really busy.

00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:41,259
I had
a pretty successful business

00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:42,961
prior to going on "Shark Tank,"

00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,162
so I just wasn't sure

00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:46,131
if it was the right thing
for me.

00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:48,767
But it was the best business
decision I have ever made.

00:32:59,244 --> 00:33:00,412
[ duck quacks ]

00:33:00,412 --> 00:33:01,913
BICKLEY: Hey, y'all!

00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:04,082
I'm Erin bickley, and this is
my friend Jenny Greer,

00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:06,985
and we're two sassy Southern
moms living in Macon, Georgia.

00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,087
There's barely any left
for you.
Hey, don't hog it!

00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:11,356
GREER: Don't let
the Southern accent fool you.

00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:14,192
When it comes to business,
we're as tough as the peach pit.

00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:15,360
My pride and joy.

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,363
Erin and I each have three kids,
and we noticed

00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:20,565
that our reflections
ain't what they used to be.

00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:23,535
It's a Georgia peach...
But it rotted.

00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:24,603
[ laughs ]

00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:26,371
GREER:
So we searched everywhere

00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:27,739
for a solution
to this common problem.

00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:30,809
It was nowhere to be found,
so we decided we'd just make it.

00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:34,246
BICKLEY: We are on the cusp
of something great,

00:33:34,246 --> 00:33:35,547
but the industry we're in

00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:38,316
requires so much capital
and so much expertise

00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:41,186
to even get to the doors,
much less get them open.

00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:44,089
If we don't get a deal from the
sharks, we will be heartbroken.

00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:47,759
We've put a lot of blood, sweat,
and tears into this business.

00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:49,494
So it's very important to us
that we succeed

00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:50,829
and show everyone

00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:52,764
that you can have your cake
and eat it, too.

00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:54,633

our product.

Hello, sharks.
I'm Jenny Greer.

A while back,
we were on a walk,

00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,384
and Jenny was bemoaning
the fact

00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:49,721
that despite all efforts
diet- and exercise-wise,

00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:52,424
she was unable
to keep her behind

00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:54,459
from sagging
below her underpant line...

00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:56,127
Ugh!

00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:58,229
...Creating what we refer
to as the two-butt effect.

00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:01,533
So I said to Erin,
"there has got to be a legging

00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:02,901
with a shaper built in!"

00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:05,837
to which I replied,
"I can assure you there is not.

00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:09,174
I've been in search of this
exact product for over a year."

00:35:09,174 --> 00:35:11,309
since we were unable
to find our dream pant

00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:14,713
anywhere on this Earth,
we created it.

00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:16,815
We married
a chic, modern trouser

00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:19,150
to a super-duper
shaping liner,

00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:22,120
and Hold Your Haunches
was born.

00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,989
I'm in the legging,
and Jenny's in the bootcut.

00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:27,158
But Hold Your Haunches
is not just about butts.

00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:29,828
We shape from muffin top
to belly flop,

00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:32,230
saggy cheeks
and saddlebags.

00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,866
So, sharks, who's ready
to get in our pants?

00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:41,206
I-In the picture, is that
the same woman before and after?

00:35:41,206 --> 00:35:42,807
It's not me, but --
CORCORAN: Who is it?
It's not you?

00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,342
Guess who --
guess who that leaves.

00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:46,244
Is that you?
Yes!

00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:48,213
Is that a real picture?
And that was you before,
and that's you after?

00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:50,515
Yes. Yes.
Did you lose weight after?

00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:52,250
No, that is
like 5 minutes apart.
No!

00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:55,186
And now that I've had
to admit that on TV --
oh, wow. These are strong.

00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:56,788
CORCORAN: Wow! Heavy!

00:35:56,788 --> 00:35:58,390
I don't think
I have ever felt

00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,425
a shaper
that is this intense.

00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:02,427
And if you'd like --
shaper on steroids.

00:36:02,427 --> 00:36:04,062
CORCORAN: Wow.
Wow, that could hold
a lot of heinie in it.

00:36:04,062 --> 00:36:05,630
GREINER: This is a shaper
on steroids. Wow.
CUBAN: Holy smokes.

00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,732
This is
pretty awesome, Barb.

00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:10,168
Wow. It must weigh 5 pounds,
these pants.

00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,137
Barbara, you wear those,
you'll -- you'll have
a blood clot.
I'm wearing them.

00:36:12,137 --> 00:36:13,571
[ laughter ]

00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:16,608
I'm just disgusted you don't
make a version for men.

00:36:16,608 --> 00:36:19,177
BICKLEY: We're going to!
Mark, you could squeeze
in these.

00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,146
I have a question regarding

00:36:21,146 --> 00:36:23,648
the -- the -- the promise
of this nature.

00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:25,550
So, let me ask it
to you this way.

00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,420
Women of certain age that have
a rubenesque figure...

00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,789
"rubenesque" -- we haven't
heard that in a long time.

00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:32,991
Voluptuous.

00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:34,426
...And they elect to use

00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:37,028
the Hold Your Haunches
lean mean strategy --

00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,396
this is where I'm
really concerned.

00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,765
Let's say they meet a single man
that's attracted to the --

00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:41,666
okay.
enough, Kevin!

00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:42,867
Wait, wait, wait!
Hear me out!

00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,869
Don't go there.
Let me go there!

00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,938
Let me go there, because I think
we have to disclose this.
Do not go there.

00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:49,174
Let's say they actually go
on that third date,

00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:51,743
and then...it's time.

00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:53,545
Oh, Kevin.

00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:56,081
Now we're facing the truth.
Horrible.

00:36:56,081 --> 00:36:59,017
This is a form
of false advertising,

00:36:59,017 --> 00:37:01,352
and there should be
litigation!

00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:02,520
What about bras, makeup?

00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,022
HERJAVEC:
Here's the problem.

00:37:04,022 --> 00:37:06,024
Who's gonna wear this?
It's gonna be so hot.

00:37:06,024 --> 00:37:07,358
It's such
a heavy material.

00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:09,027
That's not true.
GREER: It's really not.

00:37:09,027 --> 00:37:10,195
BICKLEY: It's not.
It's breathable.

00:37:10,195 --> 00:37:11,663
Except for right now.
There's no cotton in it.

00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:12,697
It's --
really?

00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:13,932
Yes, it's --

00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:15,967
you know, honestly,
I-I just have to inform

00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:18,203
my fellow male sharks --
'cause I think Barb knows --

00:37:18,203 --> 00:37:19,804
women like shapers.

00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:21,406
They do.
Every woman wants to look
10 pounds thinner.

00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:22,607
If they have muffin-top,

00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:23,842
if they have thighs
that they don't like --

00:37:23,842 --> 00:37:25,009
whatever it is.

00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:27,112
Guys, let me -- let me
simplify things here. Look.

00:37:27,112 --> 00:37:30,415
I understand completely
that every tush needs a push.

00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:31,716
[ laughs ]
Oh, good one!

00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:33,785
That was very good, yeah.
But --

00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:35,120
but you're out?
it's not --
but it's not really

00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,589
my core competency,
so I'm out.

00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,124
Well, give those
to your wife,

00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:41,960
and we'll come do a trunk show
at your house.
that's right.

00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,063
Erin, I can't see somebody
using it,

00:37:45,063 --> 00:37:46,397
'cause it seems
so heavy to me,

00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:49,134
which goes to show
I know nothing.

00:37:49,134 --> 00:37:50,435
I'm out.

00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:55,340
Why is it every time
there's a female product

00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,642
on this show,
you guys go out right away?

00:37:57,642 --> 00:37:58,843
GREINER:
That's right.

00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:00,311
We've invested
in many male products.

00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:01,746
We give it a chance.

00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:03,314
Name one male product.
You say,
"I don't know it enough."

00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:04,215
name one male product.
absolutely right.

00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:04,916
Scrub daddy.
Go ahead.

00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:06,417
That's not a male product!

00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:07,452
No, it's -- that's crap.

00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:09,187
You're not saying
women need shapers.

00:38:09,187 --> 00:38:11,456
You're saying,
"oh, you know what?"
"I don't know anything.
I'm out."

00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,324
"I don't want to touch that
with a 10-foot pole."
that's what men do -- "I don't
know anything. I'm out."

00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:15,093
right.
O'LEARY:
No, I didn't say that.

00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:17,028
I know a lot about this.
Okay.

00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:18,530
And I'm extremely concerned,

00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,965
because I think that this
is fraudulent behavior.

00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,835
I'm all about compliance
and transparency,

00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:25,537
and we don't have
any of that.

00:38:25,537 --> 00:38:26,571
Wait, wait, wait.

00:38:26,571 --> 00:38:28,239
For all the world
to hear...
Yeah.

00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:31,476
...If you met a woman
who you thought was dynamite,

00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:33,812
and later,
she took those off,

00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:36,347
are you telling me
you wouldn't like her?

00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:38,082
You know what I'd do?
I'd litigate.

00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:40,652
Oh, my God!
[ laughter ]

00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:43,021
I can't be a part of this fraud
and false advertising.

00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:45,123
Oh, my God.
I'm out.

00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:47,225
There's two things
we don't know,

00:38:47,225 --> 00:38:51,262
even though they went out
before they ever even heard.
heard.

00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:54,666
What do you make it for,
and what do you sell it for?

00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:58,136
$18 a pair
to make in Asia.

00:38:58,136 --> 00:39:00,772
But door-to-door, $30.

00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:04,309
Uh, wholesale for $69
and retail for $139.

00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:06,477
Wow.
Now, obviously,
part of this...

00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:07,979
Good margins.
...Is also because
we've committed

00:39:07,979 --> 00:39:10,548
to smaller quantities.
smaller amount.

00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:12,851
What was your profit
on your business last year?

00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,285
We profited about $50,000

00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:16,554
that we put all back
into the business.

00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:17,856
That's great.
So that's 30%.

00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,091
Can you tell us
about the sales so far?

00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:23,528
We have sold a total
of $280,000 worth.

00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,563
And in what period of time?

00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:28,733
We sold our first pair online
in November of 2010.

00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:31,569
And how -- what were your sales
in only the last 12 months?

00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:33,371
$165,000.

00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,441
I would like to make
an offer with Barb

00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:39,377
just so that, down the road,
we could show our male sharks...

00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:42,213
Absolutely.
...How they missed out
on something

00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:46,985
that could be one of the biggest
sellers of this season.

00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:48,620
I know I will get this
on QVC,

00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:51,623
and I know the women,
our customers,

00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:53,091
would appreciate it
like crazy.

00:39:53,091 --> 00:39:54,926
And I also think
that Barb and I together

00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:56,761
will get it into retailers
across the country.

00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:58,263
So, Barb, what do you
think of this?

00:39:58,263 --> 00:40:00,798
Well, why don't we talk
behind their back?
We give them --

00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:03,434
because the truth is,
I'd like to get a good deal.

00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:05,503
Okay.
Do you mind stepping out
for a minute, ladies?

00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:07,205
Go ahead.

00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:10,174
I see this two ways.

00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:12,710
Number one -- I see it
as a little bit of a challenge

00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,445
for us
against our male sharks...

00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:16,314
Oh, we are gonna succeed
just to show you guys.

00:40:16,314 --> 00:40:17,615
I have zero interest in this.
...Because I would love
to show them how this

00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:19,183
becomes a million-dollar
business immediately.

00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:20,685
So, that's like me
saying to you, "why don't
you do technology deals?

00:40:20,685 --> 00:40:22,387
You never do technology
deals. Why don't you do
technology deals?"

00:40:22,387 --> 00:40:23,655
we do technology deals.

00:40:23,655 --> 00:40:25,056
You're fools. Miss it.

00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:26,991
CUBAN: I don't know.
Be careful what you offer.

00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:28,593
I might come in,
just to prove a point.

00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,895
Don't do that.

00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:32,797
They were asking 20%.

00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:35,233
Now, you and I both know
that we have to do a lot of
work to get it out there.

00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:36,801
I'm not getting up for 10%
on this deal.

00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:39,337
I'll tell you, I --
okay. What -- what would you
like to ask for?

00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:49,380
CUBAN: I don't know.
Be careful what you offer.
All right, you can come
back in, ladies!

00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,415
HERJAVEC:
I don't know.

00:40:57,422 --> 00:41:00,925
GREINER: Okay, so,
here's our offer.

00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:04,262
Our offer
is $75,000 for 40%.

00:41:06,364 --> 00:41:07,699
What kind of greed
is this?

00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:11,169
Barb and I together,

00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:14,472
so you know we will help
get you into everywhere.

00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,274
You know --

00:41:16,274 --> 00:41:17,942
there's a very important piece,
though,

00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:19,344
that she also wants
to mention.

00:41:19,344 --> 00:41:22,080
Yes. A $100,000 credit line,
as well.

00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,516
Over the -- over the cash,
because you're gonna need it.

00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:26,985
Over it, to help fulfill
the purchase orders.

00:41:29,454 --> 00:41:30,355
That's our offer.

00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:40,031
Sold.
And we take it.

00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:42,700
There!
We accept!

00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,235
They like that. Mark, we didn't
hear you say anything.

00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:45,503
CORCORAN: We should've asked
for more.

00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:46,604
Okay.
These are the women

00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:48,072
that can take us
where we need to go.

00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:49,340
Yes!
There we go, Barb.

00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,842
And we're on the ground,
girls.

00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:51,976
Yeah, we will make you
so happy.

00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:53,144
You're a loser. You're a loser.
You're a loser.

00:41:53,144 --> 00:41:54,345
These are awesome.
I can't wait to try them on.

00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,313
Yay!
I think they look awesome.

00:41:55,313 --> 00:41:56,280
Oh, thank you so much!
I'm so excited!

00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,283
I'm hot. She's hot.
She's hot.

00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:00,418
She's hot. We're hot.

00:42:00,418 --> 00:42:03,321
We're hot. We're hot.

00:42:03,321 --> 00:42:04,989
Your head's gonna explode.
You're not. You're not.

00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:07,191
[ laughs ]
You go, girl.

00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,826
Kevin and I are gonna start
our own line -- tush push.

00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:10,094
[ laughter ]

00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:12,997
BICKLEY:
It feels so great

00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:14,832
to be validated
by these women.

00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:17,769
And our customers
have known what we have,

00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:20,605
and now two expert,
genius businesswomen

00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:22,840
recognized immediately
what Hold Your Haunches has.

00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,909
GREER: It's just the answer
to all our prayers.

00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:25,977
It's gonna be
a game-changer.
