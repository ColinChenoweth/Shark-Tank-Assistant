That is nothing.

00:00:14,792 --> 00:00:16,805

the full amount
they're asking for,

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,806

Why is it so expensive?

Because--well, 'cause I make it
here in the United States, and--

00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,941
and what do you sell them for?
The 4-ounce bottle

00:03:57,941 --> 00:03:59,947
has been selling for $9.99.
How many have you sold

00:03:59,947 --> 00:04:04,931
over what period of time?
We have been in business
for four years, and last year,

00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:06,933
our sales were $5,500.

00:04:06,933 --> 00:04:07,949
$5,500?

To me, that is the ultimate
red--red flag.

00:04:24,944 --> 00:04:26,933
"if I only got
on one more TV show,"

00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,933
"if I only got
in one more magazine"--

a-a shortcut.
Well, I'll tell you what.

00:04:30,926 --> 00:04:32,942
We did a 6-store test
with Bed Bath &amp; Beyond,

00:04:32,942 --> 00:04:36,932

they reordered three times.

00:04:36,932 --> 00:04:37,940
It was during the holidays.

00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,939
They had it up
in the front of the store.

00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:42,952
The minute they put it
in the back of the store,

00:04:42,952 --> 00:04:44,924
sales tanked.

00:04:44,924 --> 00:04:45,931
Welcome to the real world.

00:04:45,931 --> 00:04:46,943
If they didn't reorder,

00:04:46,943 --> 00:04:48,926
it's because it didn't make
enough money per linear foot

00:04:48,926 --> 00:04:49,936
for them to care about it.

00:04:49,936 --> 00:04:51,932
They put another product
in there that sold much better.

00:04:51,932 --> 00:04:53,935
Well, they--when they moved it
to the back of the store--

00:04:53,935 --> 00:04:56,934
but then what happened--
Bed Bath &amp; Beyond sees
a new Debbie every day...

00:04:56,934 --> 00:04:57,946
Right. Right.
With another product.

00:04:57,946 --> 00:04:59,946
The only Debbies that get
to stay in sell product.

00:04:59,946 --> 00:05:01,928
Yours didn't.
They threw you out.

Call it "magic spray."
Yeah.

00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,539
Right.
You've got it
into Bed Bath &amp; Beyond,

00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:43,539
so don't tell me you couldn't
pick up the phone

00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:46,538
and call the other ones,
because you did it once.
Right. No, no, no.
I understand, so--

00:07:46,538 --> 00:07:47,553
a goal--Debbie, a goal
is great to have.

00:07:47,553 --> 00:07:49,546
Right.
But you gotta have a timeline.

00:07:49,546 --> 00:07:53,533
A goal without a timeline
is simply a dream.

00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:55,537
Right.
I'm out.

00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:10,543
Look, most entrepreneurs,

00:08:10,543 --> 00:08:12,532
when their back
is up against the wall

00:08:12,532 --> 00:08:13,536
and their sales are falling,

00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:15,551
that is all that
they can think about.

00:08:15,551 --> 00:08:18,531
That consumes them.
That eats them,

00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:19,543
and that's the way
you have to be.

00:08:19,543 --> 00:08:20,553
You have to work
like there's somebody

all away from you,

00:08:22,531 --> 00:08:24,528
because there probably is.

00:08:24,528 --> 00:08:25,544
My suggestion is

00:08:25,544 --> 00:08:26,551
get somebody else
to sell it for you,

00:08:26,551 --> 00:08:28,529
because that is not
your strength.

00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:30,867

00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:50,907
Are you schoolteachers
or something?

00:14:50,907 --> 00:14:52,913
Well, we know a thing or two
about carrying people.

00:14:52,913 --> 00:14:54,913
We're both firefighters
out of Austin, Texas.

00:14:54,913 --> 00:14:56,907
Oh, there you go. All right.
You are? Yay.

00:14:56,907 --> 00:14:59,896
I wanted to ask you
about the product itself.

00:14:59,896 --> 00:15:03,915
It seems heavy.
I don't think Barb or I
would be able to carry that.

00:15:03,915 --> 00:15:05,902
You're used to carrying tanks
on your back.

00:15:05,902 --> 00:15:07,899
Sure, sure. Absolutely. Mm-hmm.
So it's something
you're used to.

00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:09,896
But if you did
do an injection mold,

00:15:09,896 --> 00:15:11,902
it could be minimal weight.

00:15:11,902 --> 00:15:12,914
I mean, the possibilities
are endless--titanium,

00:15:12,914 --> 00:15:14,900
but then your costs--
carbon fiber.

00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,912
You have to be realistic what
your costs are at that point.

00:15:16,912 --> 00:15:18,910
With the weight, keep in mind,
that's 5 1/2 pounds.

00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,896
This over here--
the current child carriers

00:15:20,896 --> 00:15:22,899
weigh 7 1/2 pounds
and upwards.

00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:24,902
(Robert) Nathan, what do you
need the money for today?

00:15:24,902 --> 00:15:26,921
$200,000.
You're asking for 15%.

00:15:26,921 --> 00:15:30,908
$110,000 would go to making
2,000 units,

00:15:30,908 --> 00:15:32,922
and we'd use $90,000
for operating expenses

00:15:32,922 --> 00:15:34,916
such as going to
the trade shows.

00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,902
(Lori) Are you familiar with
all the rules and regulations...
We are.

00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:38,893
For child safety?
Oh, yes. Yeah, yeah. Yes.

00:15:38,893 --> 00:15:40,894
Have you been doing testing
for that

00:15:40,894 --> 00:15:41,905
with an independent lab?
Yes.

00:15:41,905 --> 00:15:42,911
Yes, ma'am.
They're firemen, Lori.
Of course.

00:15:42,911 --> 00:15:44,898
Okay.
When I look at it,

00:15:44,898 --> 00:15:48,895
the first thing I think--I've
got a 4-year-old son named Jake.

00:15:48,895 --> 00:15:49,922
And Jake has finally learned
from his car seat

00:15:49,922 --> 00:15:51,917
how to undo these, right?

00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:55,893
He's gonna unbuckle it,
he's gonna smack me in the head,

00:15:55,893 --> 00:15:56,906
he's gonna punch me,

00:15:56,906 --> 00:15:59,901
and then he's gonna
unbuckle and fall over.

00:15:59,901 --> 00:16:00,920
(Kevin) I don't know. He's
facing your back. How's he--

00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,907
no, no, no. Trust me.
If he's riding,

00:16:03,907 --> 00:16:06,894
he's smacking, he's unbuckling,
and he's climbing.
(Chuckling)

00:16:06,894 --> 00:16:07,916
Kevin, it's Mark's children.
You can only imagine.
Right.

00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,906
I mean--I mean, if you have
a little boy, then you--

00:16:09,906 --> 00:16:10,921
then you know.
Yes, I-I do.

00:16:10,921 --> 00:16:13,919
Um, he's not able
to unbuckle those, specifically.

00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:15,922
Trust me, it's the same
as his car seat.

00:16:15,922 --> 00:16:17,905
And what I'm saying
about this is

00:16:17,905 --> 00:16:19,908
you shouldn't be using
this money for 2,000 units.

00:16:19,908 --> 00:16:21,913
You should use that
for your testing.

00:16:21,913 --> 00:16:23,911
Because the worst possible
scenario

00:16:23,911 --> 00:16:25,921
is for you to take
$200,000,

00:16:25,921 --> 00:16:29,895
invest $110,000 in inventory,
get them out there,

00:16:29,895 --> 00:16:31,900
and realize you've got a problem
and you have to take them back.

00:16:32,906 --> 00:16:35,897
I-I think that Mark,
shockingly, is right about this.

00:16:35,897 --> 00:16:37,913
I don't know if you want
to dump money

00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,895
into buying 2,000 units.

00:16:40,895 --> 00:16:41,910
I think it's a great product.

00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,908
I think you can continue
to test the market.

00:16:43,908 --> 00:16:45,898
How open are you to that?

00:16:45,898 --> 00:16:47,902
We're incredibly open to it.
You all are the experts.

00:16:47,902 --> 00:16:49,905
You have the resources,
the connections.

00:16:49,905 --> 00:16:51,915
Look, guys, you're not even
a product yet, right?

00:16:51,915 --> 00:16:53,918
You're--you're
a proof of concept.

00:16:53,918 --> 00:16:56,904
You--you're too early
for me to get involved.

00:16:56,904 --> 00:16:58,909
I mean, I love what you're
doing, I'll be a customer,

00:16:58,909 --> 00:17:00,906
but you've got to take it
further.

00:17:00,906 --> 00:17:02,896
You know, like they say, you
gotta crawl before you ball,

00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:03,914
and you guys aren't even
crawling yet, right?

00:17:03,914 --> 00:17:05,911
And so for that reason,
I'm out.

00:17:07,907 --> 00:17:09,908
(Barbara) Here are
my two concerns.

00:17:09,908 --> 00:17:13,901
I think this product needs
to be demonstrated to sell.

00:17:13,901 --> 00:17:14,920
I see this on a store counter,

00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,916
and it looks like every other
black thing out there

00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,903
that you strap on
to your body.

00:17:18,903 --> 00:17:21,907
And I'm concerned as to how
it's gonna sell on its own

00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:23,901
without the demonstration aspect
of it,

00:17:23,901 --> 00:17:25,901
and I think
that's a real liability.

00:17:25,901 --> 00:17:26,920
And you know what?
(Chuckles) Most importantly,

00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,903
I don't think parents want
to carry heavy kids.

00:17:30,903 --> 00:17:32,896
I think that window
is so small.
They don't want to,

00:17:32,896 --> 00:17:33,900
but we end up doing it.
(Barbara) They don't want to.

00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,917
Yeah, if you go on a trip.
I agree with you.

00:17:34,917 --> 00:17:36,916
But you have to, Barbara.
But day to day?
No, a 7-year-old?

00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,897
Forget about it.
There's not a dad in America

00:17:38,897 --> 00:17:39,920
who hasn't got the look
from the mom.

00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,906
But you're gonna bring this
with you the whole day

00:17:41,906 --> 00:17:42,912
because of one time?
Yes.

00:17:42,912 --> 00:17:46,914
I think the window's too small,
so I'm out.

00:17:46,914 --> 00:17:50,903
Just to speak to
the market research and testing,

00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,911
we wear this to a kite festival
in Austin

00:17:52,911 --> 00:17:54,893
with over 100,000 people,

00:17:54,893 --> 00:17:55,902
and you will get mobbed
by everybody.

00:17:55,902 --> 00:17:57,921
We spent two hours there.
We handed out cards.

00:17:57,921 --> 00:17:59,902
In the following 24 hours,

00:17:59,902 --> 00:18:01,898
we sold over $3,000
worth of units.

00:18:01,898 --> 00:18:03,917
(Lori) It's like umbrellas
when it's raining, you know?
Exactly.

00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,897
Everybody needs one.
Right.

00:18:05,897 --> 00:18:06,908
So you should just
stand at fairs

00:18:06,908 --> 00:18:08,905
with that on your back
and have them to sell.

00:18:08,905 --> 00:18:10,899
Seriously.
And every parent will come up
and buy one.

00:18:10,899 --> 00:18:11,915
And you're right. And that's
when the magic happens,

00:18:11,915 --> 00:18:13,915
when people get to see it
and touch it and feel it.
Mm-hmm.

00:18:13,915 --> 00:18:15,911
But that's where we are
gonna rely on

00:18:15,911 --> 00:18:18,900
the skills
of dedicated sales staff,

00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,922
people that are
well-versed in it.
No, no, no, no, no.

00:18:20,922 --> 00:18:22,901
You're not ready
for that yet.

00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:27,900
I would love to help you,
because I love firemen.

00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,911
You risk your lives every day
to save others.

00:18:30,911 --> 00:18:33,912
My problem with the product,
though--

00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,908
I'm worried about
the safety issues with it.

00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:39,907
I think this is really clever,
but I'm not sure

00:18:39,907 --> 00:18:40,917
if you're gonna have issues

00:18:40,917 --> 00:18:42,898
with either passing
safety testing

00:18:42,898 --> 00:18:45,903
or liability from consumers.

00:18:45,903 --> 00:18:47,918
For those reasons, I'm out.

00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,905
I'm past all
the manufacturing issues.

00:18:50,905 --> 00:18:52,910
I'm gonna make the assumption
within the next year

00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:55,898
you'll optimize for weight
and design.

00:18:55,898 --> 00:18:56,921
I'm in a different place.

00:18:56,921 --> 00:18:59,905
Even if it's perfect today,
I have no idea

00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,917
what it's going to cost
to actually scale it

00:19:01,917 --> 00:19:03,904
and start selling it,
because I don't know

00:19:03,904 --> 00:19:05,901
what my customer
acquisition costs are.

00:19:05,901 --> 00:19:07,912
Even baby products--
and I used to be in a business

00:19:07,912 --> 00:19:10,903
that sold products for children
between the ages of 3 and 5--

00:19:10,903 --> 00:19:13,909
we spent hundreds
of millions of dollars

00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:15,900
trying to capture the mothers.

00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,899
It was really expensive.
It never got easier.

00:19:18,899 --> 00:19:20,906
And that's a hard road.
I'm out.

00:19:22,914 --> 00:19:24,907
I've made a lot of money
by trusting my gut.

00:19:24,907 --> 00:19:27,919
My first sense,
when I saw River get on it,

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,896
I said,
this is a great product.

00:19:30,896 --> 00:19:31,915
And as people started
talking about

00:19:31,915 --> 00:19:33,914
all the objections,
all the negatives,

00:19:33,914 --> 00:19:35,917
I became less excited.

00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:37,905
My best friend Rob
is a fireman,

00:19:37,905 --> 00:19:39,908
and so he taught me,
when you go into a fire,

00:19:39,908 --> 00:19:41,914
the very first rule is
stay calm.

00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:45,920
The second rule is
assess the situation.

00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:50,911
I don't think you've assessed
this situation enough.

00:19:52,902 --> 00:19:54,900
I think the design needs to be
a little bit better,

00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,903
the weight--all those issues.

00:19:57,903 --> 00:20:00,900
So I don't think this is
a company today.

00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,913
I think it's a journey.

00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,905
But I want to go down
that journey with you.

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,909
But I see it as a partnership.

00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:13,900
$200,000 for one-third.

00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,912
Um... okay.

00:20:17,893 --> 00:20:19,915
You mind if we take
one minute?

00:20:19,915 --> 00:20:21,905
If you want to run that risk,
go ahead.
There's a fire!

00:20:21,905 --> 00:20:23,920
Yeah.
The fire is burning,
and you're gonna take a minute?

00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,914
No, we don't. You know what?
We would love to work with you.
Absolutely.

00:20:27,914 --> 00:20:29,906
Congratulations, guys.
Congratulations, guys.

00:20:29,906 --> 00:20:31,903
Thanks, guys.
Thank you so much.
I think it's a great product.

00:20:31,903 --> 00:20:33,895
Yeah. Nice to meet you guys.
Thank you so much.

00:20:33,895 --> 00:20:34,908
Yeah. Thanks for being
fire guys.
Thank you.

00:20:34,908 --> 00:20:36,916
And thank y'all for your time.
But you know what, guys?

00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,893
It's funny. The other sharks
almost talked me out of it,

00:20:39,893 --> 00:20:40,914
'cause they brought up
all these problems,

00:20:40,914 --> 00:20:42,914
and I just went back
to the very first reaction.

00:20:42,914 --> 00:20:44,914
And I think dads are gonna
have that reaction.

00:20:44,914 --> 00:20:47,895
As soon as they see it,
they're gonna get psyched.
Dads'll get it in a heartbeat.

00:20:47,895 --> 00:20:48,908
It's easy to get.
Congrats, guys.
Thank you.

00:20:48,908 --> 00:20:49,915
Thanks you guys so much.
Good luck, guys.

00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,895
Thank you.

00:20:51,895 --> 00:20:52,918
We couldn't have asked
for a better partnership

00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,913
with Robert. We really
feel like he gets it.

00:20:54,913 --> 00:20:56,919
Um, he's gonna be great
in helping us

00:20:56,919 --> 00:20:59,912
navigate the waters and to
get us where we need to be.
Yeah.

(Chuckles)
I'm Juli, and this is

00:21:25,556 --> 00:21:27,558
my best friend
and business partner, Ozma.

00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:29,552
We are seeking $50,000

00:21:29,552 --> 00:21:32,550
for a 20% equity
in our company.

00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,565
Our product is
a never-seen-before,

revolutionary cooking
lifestyle convenience product.

00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:40,553
One night, we were hosting
a dinner party

00:21:40,553 --> 00:21:43,543
for our girlfriends.
The main dish was fish.

00:21:43,543 --> 00:21:45,545
After dinner, the girls and I
hit the town

00:21:45,545 --> 00:21:47,558
and headed to
a swanky L.A. lounge.

00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:49,552
Someone approached me
and told me

00:21:49,552 --> 00:21:51,557
my hair smelled like fish.

00:21:51,557 --> 00:21:52,569
Ew!
I was mortified,

00:21:52,569 --> 00:21:56,545
so I asked the bartender
for a second opinion,

00:21:56,545 --> 00:21:58,541
and sure enough,
my luscious locks

00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,563
did indeed smell like
our main dinner course.

00:22:00,563 --> 00:22:03,544
We knew there had to be
a better solution

00:22:03,544 --> 00:22:05,558
to this common
stinky problem.

00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:08,559
(Both) So...
(Laughter)

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,569
We've created the Kookin' Kap.

00:22:10,569 --> 00:22:12,555
(Robert, singsongy)
Da-dun!
(Ozma, singsong) Ta-da!

00:22:12,555 --> 00:22:14,569
(Barbara) You gotta be kidding.
(Mark) Oh, my lord.

00:22:14,569 --> 00:22:16,558
The Kookin' Kap is so easy
to use.

00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:19,543
Just put it
right over your head...

00:22:19,543 --> 00:22:22,545
Twirl your hair up.

00:22:22,545 --> 00:22:24,561
No hair-tying needed.
And...

00:22:24,561 --> 00:22:26,544
(Both) Voilà!
(Laughter)

00:22:26,544 --> 00:22:28,564
(Both) And one size fits all!

00:22:28,564 --> 00:22:30,567
Oh, God.
Wow.

00:22:30,567 --> 00:22:32,557
The Kookin' Kap
is the modern version

00:22:32,557 --> 00:22:34,563
of the traditional chef hat
that not only

00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:37,542
keeps the smell of food
out of your hair...

00:22:37,542 --> 00:22:39,543
(Both) It also keeps hair
out of your food!

00:22:39,543 --> 00:22:41,552
(Juli) And it's chic
and comfortable.
(Laughs)

00:22:41,552 --> 00:22:42,569
The Kookin' Kap saves
any blowout

00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:45,555
and keeps your hair
smelling fresh

00:22:45,555 --> 00:22:47,565
and looking like you just
styled it.

00:22:49,563 --> 00:22:50,564
(Laughter)
(Robert) Whoo!

00:22:50,564 --> 00:22:52,560
Hair smell like crap?

00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,560
(Both) Get a cap!
(Kevin and Robert) Wow!

00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,555
Let's have one
on Kevin here, please.

00:22:56,555 --> 00:22:57,566
Yes! I think you'd look
pretty in pink.
Let me try the pink one.

00:22:57,566 --> 00:22:59,558
I like the look.
He wants the pink one.

00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:01,556
Yeah, I think you'd
look hot in pink.
You guys are fun.

00:23:01,556 --> 00:23:03,541
Have you sold
any of these so far?

00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:05,562
(Robert) Ah.
We have sold 1,729 hats.

00:23:05,562 --> 00:23:06,567
Thank you, Ozma.
Uh-huh.

00:23:06,567 --> 00:23:09,553
In what time period?
Just under one year.

00:23:09,553 --> 00:23:12,542
Oh, you look great
in that cap.

00:23:12,542 --> 00:23:13,553
Yeah, it feels good, too.

00:23:13,553 --> 00:23:14,567
(Lori) Let's see, Kevin.
Yeah.

00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:16,565
Juli, make him take that off.
Your sales are gonna go down.

00:23:16,565 --> 00:23:18,559
Ah! We want them--
he looks like
little Bo peep.

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,554
It does look like
the camera's on him.

00:23:20,554 --> 00:23:22,551
Okay, so you sold
a thousand--what was it?

00:23:22,551 --> 00:23:24,560
1,729 caps.
At what price?

00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,541
At anywhere between
$9.95 and $12.95.

00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:29,547
Juli, what's the name
of the company? Kookin'--

00:23:29,547 --> 00:23:30,560
Kookin' Kap.
It's called Kookin' Kaps.

00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,550
Kookin' Kap.
Is it kookin' karps
or Kookin' Kap?

00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,559
(Juli and Ozma)
Kookin' Kap.
(Juli) So in addition--

00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:35,557
so why does it say "karp"?
It looks like it.

00:23:35,557 --> 00:23:36,566
It doesn't--it's not an "r."
It says "Kap"!

00:23:36,566 --> 00:23:38,546
(Kevin) It says "karp."
It's "p" for "Kap."

00:23:38,546 --> 00:23:39,563
And what's your background?

00:23:39,563 --> 00:23:41,550
Well, so...

00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,569
We work for one of the largest

00:23:42,569 --> 00:23:44,564
financial services companies
in the world.

00:23:44,564 --> 00:23:46,543
Really?
(Juli and Ozma) Yes.

00:23:46,543 --> 00:23:47,550
Doing what?

00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,559
I actually work
at Ernst &amp; Young

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,549
as a manager
in our advisory practice.

00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:53,563
I'm a campus recruiter
for our Los Angeles

00:23:53,563 --> 00:23:55,560
and San Diego tax practice.

00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,553
Should I be concerned
about the first thing

00:23:57,553 --> 00:23:58,568
I read in the label?

00:23:58,568 --> 00:24:01,543
It says, "Caution. Flammable."

00:24:01,543 --> 00:24:02,557
Nonflammable.

00:24:02,557 --> 00:24:04,545
No, it says "flammable"
right here.
(Robert scoffs)

00:24:04,545 --> 00:24:05,562
It does.
It says "flammable."
(Gasps) No!

00:24:05,562 --> 00:24:07,550
(Barbara) Yeah.
They must--

00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,556
so you have mis-labeled,
that's all.

00:24:08,556 --> 00:24:10,559
(Robert) That's not good.
That--

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,555
yeah, just like "kookin' karps."

00:24:12,555 --> 00:24:14,542
(Robert laughing)
No, it's Kookin' Kap.

00:24:14,542 --> 00:24:15,560
In addition to the--
(laughs)

00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,543
Who does your spell-check?

00:24:18,543 --> 00:24:19,567
So, Juli and Ozma, how are you
selling these? Online?

00:24:19,567 --> 00:24:22,544
Yes. We're selling them online.
So right now,
we're selling them online,

00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,564
direct to consumer.
And what do they cost you
to make?

00:24:24,564 --> 00:24:27,543
They cost us $3.70.
$3.70.

00:24:27,543 --> 00:24:28,557
I love you say everything
in unison!

00:24:28,557 --> 00:24:30,540
And you're making them here?
(Juli and Ozma) Yeah.

00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,540
Where do you make
big bucks in this?

00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,555
I would say either
retail or on TV.

00:24:34,555 --> 00:24:37,551
TV? Hang on?
I wish there was a shark

00:24:37,551 --> 00:24:39,557
that worked on TV
all the time.
(Kevin) I--

00:24:39,557 --> 00:24:41,548
(juli) Who loves to cook!
(Robert speaks indistinctly)

00:24:41,548 --> 00:24:42,559
(Robert) Who could it be?
You know what, guys?

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,557
This is the perfect
QVC product.
Mark!

00:24:44,557 --> 00:24:46,540
I hope Lori carries it.
I think so, too.

00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,552
But that's not me.
I'm out.

00:24:48,552 --> 00:24:50,560
Okay. Thanks, Mark.
(Lori) I'll tell you,

00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,551
I have one problem with it.
And--
okay.

00:24:52,551 --> 00:24:53,568
(Robert) What?
You're adorable,

00:24:53,568 --> 00:24:56,549
but somebody could take
a shower cap

00:24:56,549 --> 00:24:58,556
and put it on their head, too.
This is so much better.

00:24:58,556 --> 00:25:00,545
And stop the smell.

00:25:00,545 --> 00:25:02,557
And--
shower caps are
actually flammable,

00:25:02,557 --> 00:25:04,543
when this is not,
even though it says--

00:25:04,543 --> 00:25:05,564
even though this says it is?
But this is! It says so!

00:25:05,564 --> 00:25:07,545
No, it's not, I promise.

00:25:07,545 --> 00:25:09,566
And the shower cap is
actually not breathable.

00:25:09,566 --> 00:25:12,550
So when--you actually will
get sweaty...
That's the better answer.

00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,559
And your hair will get sweaty,
um, so it actually just is not--

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,547
this you could wear
for hours.
Yeah.

00:25:16,547 --> 00:25:17,559
Like, you could cook an entire
dinner party and wear this,

00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:18,568
and you'll take it off--

00:25:18,568 --> 00:25:20,559
but--
I like that you're
inventing something...

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,562
But, juli--
but I don't think there's
an enormous need for this.

00:25:23,562 --> 00:25:25,555
When I invest in a product,

00:25:25,555 --> 00:25:28,543
I like something
that solves a problem,

00:25:28,543 --> 00:25:29,559
and this is a problem,

00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:31,552
but I think it's
a small problem.

00:25:31,552 --> 00:25:33,543
Lori, it actually
solves two problems.

00:25:33,543 --> 00:25:34,569
Not only does it keep
the smell of food

00:25:34,569 --> 00:25:37,568
out of your hair, it also
keeps hair out of your food.

00:25:37,568 --> 00:25:39,549
(Lori) Mnh.
Ahh!

00:25:39,549 --> 00:25:40,567
So it's also
a contamination issue.

00:25:40,567 --> 00:25:44,547
Here's the thing--I don't think
if I were making fish at home,

00:25:44,547 --> 00:25:46,556
I don't think I'd be going out
dancing right afterwards

00:25:46,556 --> 00:25:48,542
or something like that.
Really? Well,
even if you weren't,

00:25:48,542 --> 00:25:49,566
you still wouldn't want
the fish to get--

00:25:49,566 --> 00:25:51,560
the smell to get in your
hair for the next day.
But couldn't you take a shower?

00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,569
You know, I've never really
thought about it.

00:25:52,569 --> 00:25:55,545
Perhaps I have smelly hair.
I cook most nights.

00:25:55,545 --> 00:25:56,569
I don't know. But...

00:25:56,569 --> 00:25:59,569
(Chuckling) I just
can't picture... uh...

00:25:59,569 --> 00:26:01,566
Uh... cooking with this
on my head.
(Laughs)

00:26:01,566 --> 00:26:04,546
And by the way, I think
you two are adorable.
(Both) Thank you.

00:26:04,546 --> 00:26:05,560
But it's not the product
for me. I'm out.

00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,544
Thank you.
Thank you
for your time.

00:26:08,544 --> 00:26:10,566
Ladies, I think you're
two beautiful women,

00:26:10,566 --> 00:26:13,543
but when you put the cap on...
(Barbara laughs)

00:26:13,543 --> 00:26:15,543
You look like
80-year-old grandmas.
No!

00:26:15,543 --> 00:26:17,564
So I'm not sure
I want to buy something

00:26:17,564 --> 00:26:21,549
for my wife, or my wife
wants to buy something...
She's only gonna wear it
while she's cooking!

00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:23,568
That's gonna make her look
like an 80-year-old grandma.
Only when she's cooking.

00:26:23,568 --> 00:26:26,557
Ozma, I-I'm out.
Okay.

00:26:26,557 --> 00:26:28,544
I love 80-year-old grandmas,

00:26:28,544 --> 00:26:32,544
but I don't see
the real need for this.

00:26:32,544 --> 00:26:34,544
I'm out.

00:26:34,544 --> 00:26:35,554
I think it's ironic...

00:26:35,554 --> 00:26:37,561
(Laughter)
That the only person

00:26:37,561 --> 00:26:40,555
who is still in
has no hair.

00:26:40,555 --> 00:26:42,554
All right,
let's talk numbers.
Yes.

00:26:42,554 --> 00:26:44,556
Yeah, you know,
listen, ladies...
(Laughter)

00:26:44,556 --> 00:26:45,568
The whole kookin' karp
thing is crazy.

00:26:45,568 --> 00:26:48,547
I-I think you're cute,
but this is not a business,

00:26:48,547 --> 00:26:50,567
it's a hobby.
Come on. Just ask for her
to give your money back.

00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:53,542
Ladies, you're losing him.
No, no, no!

00:26:53,542 --> 00:26:54,567
Wait, wait, wait. We can--
sweeten the offer!
Sweeten the offer!

00:26:54,567 --> 00:26:56,545
We can sell anything.
(Lori) No, don't.

00:26:56,545 --> 00:26:57,558
We can sell peanut butter
and jelly in a steakhouse.

00:26:57,558 --> 00:26:59,557
We can sell Kookin' Kaps
to the masses.

00:26:59,557 --> 00:27:01,566
Come on!
Oh, my goodness.

00:27:01,566 --> 00:27:03,543
Mr. wonderful.

00:27:03,543 --> 00:27:06,563
Absolutely not. I'm out.
(Laughter)

00:27:06,563 --> 00:27:08,562
You guys keep thinking, though.
Congratulations, guys.
Good luck.

00:27:08,562 --> 00:27:09,566
Thank you.
Thank you for your time.

00:27:09,566 --> 00:27:10,567
That's awesome.

Oh, my God.

Wow!
And I'm the creator

00:27:47,545 --> 00:27:49,540
of the rapid ramen cooker,
the world's fastest,

00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,557
easiest, and healthiest way

00:27:50,557 --> 00:27:52,561
to make ramen noodles
in the microwave.

00:27:52,561 --> 00:27:56,540
I'm here seeking an investment
of $300,000

00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,558
for a 10% equity stake
in my company.

00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:01,552
Now, many of you
are familiar with these--

00:28:01,552 --> 00:28:02,555
ramen noodles.

00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:04,553
They're an undisputed
college staple,

00:28:04,553 --> 00:28:06,556
and the annual consumption
of these packets

00:28:06,556 --> 00:28:08,558
is 95 billion worldwide.

00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:10,562
However, surprisingly,

00:28:10,562 --> 00:28:12,562
these things don't have
microwaving instructions,

00:28:12,562 --> 00:28:15,553
requiring you to make it on
the stove, which is a hassle.

00:28:15,553 --> 00:28:18,546
That's why I created
the rapid ramen cooker.

00:28:18,546 --> 00:28:20,560
The rapid ramen cooker
is a square-shaped bowl

00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,557
in the same exact dimensions
of a block of ramen noodles.

00:28:23,557 --> 00:28:26,540
All you do is you take
the ramen noodles,

00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:29,558
put it inside the cooker,
add water to the water line,

00:28:29,558 --> 00:28:32,555
pop it in the microwave
for three to four minutes,

00:28:32,555 --> 00:28:35,567
and it makes perfect ramen
every single time.

00:28:35,567 --> 00:28:38,554
So here, I got some
cooked ramen right here.

00:28:38,554 --> 00:28:41,541
Look how perfect
the ramen is.

00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:44,540
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
Stovetop quality
in less than half the time.

00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,554
My goal is to put
rapid ramen cookers

00:28:46,554 --> 00:28:48,548
in the hands
of every single consumer

00:28:48,548 --> 00:28:49,566
of ramen noodles worldwide,

00:28:49,566 --> 00:28:52,540
and I'm looking for sharks
to join me in that mission.

00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,555
I'm gonna give you guys
some, uh, ramen cookers

00:28:54,555 --> 00:28:56,543
so you can try it out.

00:28:56,543 --> 00:28:57,560
You're not gonna give us
the noodles to go with it?
Absolutely.

00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,556
I'm gonna bring some noodles
to you as well.
Thank God.

00:28:59,556 --> 00:29:01,561
I don't have a microwave
here, though.
There you go. (Laughs)

00:29:01,561 --> 00:29:04,552
Thank you.
It doesn't come with noodles?

00:29:04,552 --> 00:29:06,568
(Chris) It doesn't come with
noodles. It's just a cooker.

00:29:06,568 --> 00:29:09,555
And so you can see how
beautifully cooked...

00:29:09,555 --> 00:29:11,563
Let me taste that guy.
I'm hungry.
Those ramen noodles are.

00:29:11,563 --> 00:29:14,557
Why not just do it,
I mean, the old-fashioned way?

00:29:14,557 --> 00:29:16,569
Take a cup,
put some water in it,

00:29:16,569 --> 00:29:18,569
you stick it in the microwave,

00:29:18,569 --> 00:29:21,563
your pour the noodles in,
you eat it, you go to sleep,

00:29:21,563 --> 00:29:23,558
you wake up, recover
from your hangover.

00:29:23,558 --> 00:29:25,556
(Laughs)
I've been making it
in the microwave all my life.

00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:27,559
Put you never get
the stovetop quality taste.

00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:30,568
Sometimes--
you're drunk.
It doesn't matter.

00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:32,545
It does.
It does matter.

00:29:32,545 --> 00:29:35,541
Other bowls just heat
excess water.

00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:37,564
And they're not specifically
designed to cook ramen noodles.

00:29:37,564 --> 00:29:40,551
Help me out here.
You got a $300,000 ask,

00:29:40,551 --> 00:29:44,541
and I get 10%
of the rapid ramen cooker.

00:29:44,541 --> 00:29:49,542
So computed value's
3 million bucks.
Correct.

00:29:49,542 --> 00:29:51,551
Now before I put you
in the microwave...
(Laughs)

00:29:51,551 --> 00:29:53,549
Explain to me
why that makes sense.

00:29:53,549 --> 00:29:55,568
Tell me about your sales
and how much cash you've made.
Absolutely.

00:29:55,568 --> 00:29:57,548
In the last three months,

00:29:57,548 --> 00:29:59,560
I've done over $164,000
in sales.

00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,567
Wow.
How much do you sell
the rapid ramen cooker for?

00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,569
Uh, it retails for $5.99.

00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:06,569
(Kevin) Okay, and how much
does it cost to make?

00:30:06,569 --> 00:30:09,547
About 75 cents.
And it's all online?

00:30:09,547 --> 00:30:11,549
You don't have any retailers
selling this?

00:30:11,549 --> 00:30:12,556
Absolutely incorrect.

00:30:12,556 --> 00:30:14,565
We went from zero stores
to over 2,500 stores

00:30:14,565 --> 00:30:16,544
in the last three months.

00:30:16,544 --> 00:30:17,554
Who are the stores?

00:30:17,554 --> 00:30:20,543
We are in Raley's,
Albertsons, Safeway,

00:30:20,543 --> 00:30:22,555
Winco, H-E-B in Texas.

00:30:22,555 --> 00:30:24,548
(Robert) How did you get into
all those stores?

00:30:24,548 --> 00:30:26,566
Grinding, man. I just
pick up the phone and call.

00:30:26,566 --> 00:30:28,549
Good for you.
I love that.

00:30:28,549 --> 00:30:30,562
Chris, is that all you?
Every single, uh, retailer

00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:32,569
that I've, uh, landed
was all me.

00:30:32,569 --> 00:30:35,555
If this keeps going, why can't
somebody just knock this off?

00:30:35,555 --> 00:30:37,558
It's patent pending.
What's patented?

00:30:37,558 --> 00:30:38,567
It's the reservoir design

00:30:38,567 --> 00:30:41,541
of a container that cooks
ramen noodles.

00:30:41,541 --> 00:30:44,542
You seem very bright
and very enterprising to me.

00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:46,558
I'd like to hear
about your background.

00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:49,559
Well, I've been an entrepreneur
since I was 16 years old.

00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:52,133
At 16, there was nothing
to do for teenagers,

00:30:52,133 --> 00:30:54,138
so I created dance parties.

00:30:54,138 --> 00:30:57,142
Charging 10 bucks a head,
I was making $4,000

00:30:57,142 --> 00:30:59,141
in just one event.
At 19 years old,

00:30:59,141 --> 00:31:01,123
I had
my own modeling agency.

00:31:01,123 --> 00:31:02,137
When I got out of college,

00:31:02,137 --> 00:31:04,137
I started
my own staffing company.

00:31:04,137 --> 00:31:07,129
Uh, with zero revenue,
did over a million dollars

00:31:07,129 --> 00:31:08,138
in less than 14 months.

00:31:08,138 --> 00:31:09,142
What happened to that business?

00:31:09,142 --> 00:31:11,119
That business
is still rolling.

00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,142
Do you own it?

00:31:12,142 --> 00:31:14,125
I still own 100%
of that business.
You still running it?

00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:17,131
Well, what I did is
I hired my long-term employee,

00:31:17,131 --> 00:31:19,143
uh, to run the day-to-day
operations of that company,

00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:22,138
and I've been focusing 100%
on rapid ramen.

00:31:22,138 --> 00:31:25,121
To me, that suggests

00:31:25,121 --> 00:31:27,139
that all you've done
is jump from

00:31:27,139 --> 00:31:29,132
quickie business
to quickie business

00:31:29,132 --> 00:31:31,115
to quickie business,

00:31:31,115 --> 00:31:33,128
because either you lose interest
or you can't run the business.

00:31:33,128 --> 00:31:35,139
Absolutely not, Mark.
With the staffing company,

00:31:35,139 --> 00:31:38,115
when we hit this recession,

00:31:38,115 --> 00:31:39,122
uh, it was the biggest hit

00:31:39,122 --> 00:31:41,116
my--I've ever experienced
in my life.

00:31:41,116 --> 00:31:42,143
Fair enough.
Look, I feel your pain, right?

00:31:42,143 --> 00:31:44,139
Everybody got hit.
Continued to happen.

00:31:44,139 --> 00:31:46,131
Uh, staffing company
has not recovered.

00:31:46,131 --> 00:31:49,143
But what I understood is that I
could not part-time this thing.

00:31:49,143 --> 00:31:52,118
I had
a huge opportunity here,

00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:54,126
so I put all my focus
on rapid ramen.

00:31:54,126 --> 00:31:57,116
What's your sales
in the last month?
About $80,000.

00:31:57,116 --> 00:31:59,135
And what percentage of that
was through retailers?

00:31:59,135 --> 00:32:00,144
About 80% is retail.

00:32:00,144 --> 00:32:03,118
My projections
with just safeway alone--

00:32:03,118 --> 00:32:04,143
you know,
just selling one a day.

00:32:04,143 --> 00:32:07,122
Right now in winco,
we're selling three a day,

00:32:07,122 --> 00:32:09,132
21 units a week.
You are?

00:32:09,132 --> 00:32:11,130
What does that look like
for the whole year?

00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,141
For the whole year,
we're--we're expected

00:32:12,141 --> 00:32:15,115
to do over $2 million
this year.

00:32:16,127 --> 00:32:18,115
Okay, so something's
not adding up here.
It doesn't compute.

00:32:18,115 --> 00:32:19,135
Yeah, I'm having a problem, too.

00:32:19,135 --> 00:32:23,125
If you're doing $80,000 a month
with huge margins,

00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:24,139
you should be generating,
you know,

00:32:24,139 --> 00:32:26,142
very quickly $300,000
in cash flow

00:32:26,142 --> 00:32:28,122
to reinvest in the business.

00:32:28,122 --> 00:32:32,115
Right now I have over $150,000
in receivables.

00:32:32,115 --> 00:32:34,132
But I look
at our bank account.

00:32:34,132 --> 00:32:36,136
It's--we're just
turning through the pro--

00:32:36,136 --> 00:32:37,140
through our inventory.

00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,117
So you need capital
for inventory.

00:32:39,117 --> 00:32:40,122
We need capital
for inventory.

00:32:40,122 --> 00:32:42,118
You need $300,000 right now?

00:32:42,118 --> 00:32:43,124
Based on our projection,

00:32:43,124 --> 00:32:44,135
we may even need
a little more than that,

00:32:44,135 --> 00:32:46,117
but I-I take it off
the $300,000

00:32:46,117 --> 00:32:49,115
because I do have receivables
coming in.

00:32:49,115 --> 00:32:51,133
So your expectation is
if I give you $300,000 today

00:32:51,133 --> 00:32:55,139
and you need another million
tomorrow, I'm gonna fund that?

00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,124
I hope you have the wherewithal
to do that.

00:32:58,126 --> 00:33:00,135
I think what happens here is
you wanna run with this thing,

00:33:00,135 --> 00:33:03,117
sell as many as you can
till you burn it out.

00:33:03,117 --> 00:33:04,121
That's basically it.
Well, that's not--

00:33:04,121 --> 00:33:05,130
because there
will be competitors

00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:06,132
that come in at a lower price

00:33:06,132 --> 00:33:08,118
and squeeze that margin
down to pennies.

00:33:08,118 --> 00:33:09,143
There's nothing proprietary
about this.

00:33:09,143 --> 00:33:11,119
I understand you have a patent,

00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:12,123
but a small modification
will do the same thing.

00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:13,130
You understand that.

00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:14,131
Which leads to the question,

00:33:14,131 --> 00:33:15,141
how did you get
to your valuation?

00:33:15,141 --> 00:33:17,142
We're gonna do $2 million
this year.
You hope.

00:33:17,142 --> 00:33:19,133
Yeah, it's hard to see--
I don't hope, mark.

00:33:19,133 --> 00:33:21,119
(Kevin) Well,
of course he hopes.
I'm--I'm--yeah.

00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:23,124
You hope, just like when
you had your staffing business.

00:33:23,124 --> 00:33:24,126
I'm sure things were great,

00:33:24,126 --> 00:33:25,144
and you projected out
a whole lot more.

00:33:25,144 --> 00:33:27,140
Just like when you had
your model business.

00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,133
What you're really saying is
your business is worth

00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:33,122
$3 million
on what, $200,000 in sales?

00:33:33,122 --> 00:33:34,135
Well, I'll tell you this.

00:33:34,135 --> 00:33:37,121
If I were offered $3 million
today to sell the company,

00:33:37,121 --> 00:33:38,124
I wouldn't sell it,

00:33:38,124 --> 00:33:39,136
based on the growth
that we're having.

00:33:39,136 --> 00:33:42,132
If someone offered you
$3 million today,

00:33:42,132 --> 00:33:44,118
you wouldn't take it?

00:33:44,118 --> 00:33:45,134
I wouldn't take it, Mark.

00:33:45,134 --> 00:33:47,144
Un-un-undeniably,
I wouldn't take it.

00:33:47,144 --> 00:33:49,129
You're a fool.
You're a fool.
I wish I had the courage.

00:33:49,129 --> 00:33:50,134
Mark, I--
you're a fool. I'm out.

00:33:52,124 --> 00:33:54,137
I don't know
if I like your plan

00:33:54,137 --> 00:33:57,136
to burn up all my cash
in inventory.

00:33:57,136 --> 00:34:00,137
'Cause one day, what happens
to products like this is,

00:34:00,137 --> 00:34:01,141
they stop selling.

00:34:01,141 --> 00:34:03,135
And whatever's sitting
in the warehouse,

00:34:03,135 --> 00:34:05,128
you own it,
and you gotta eat it.

00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:07,116
If you're gonna stay
on your path,

00:34:07,116 --> 00:34:09,144
you need a big wallet.
Happen to have one.

00:34:09,144 --> 00:34:11,132
(Chuckles)
All right?

00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,121
So here's an offer
I'll make for you, okay?

00:34:13,121 --> 00:34:15,129
I think it may be
the only offer you get.

00:34:15,129 --> 00:34:17,140
I will give you your $300,000.

00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:20,127
I want $1.10...

00:34:20,127 --> 00:34:23,118
Ha!
Every time you sell one
until I get my cash back,

00:34:23,118 --> 00:34:25,119
because I don't know
how long it's gonna take you

00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,142
to sell 300,000 units.

00:34:26,142 --> 00:34:28,144
And after I get my cash back,

00:34:28,144 --> 00:34:31,143
I get 50 cents in perpetuity.

00:34:31,143 --> 00:34:34,117
Chris, this product's gonna last
about two years, maybe three.

00:34:34,117 --> 00:34:36,135
What equity are you taking?
Zero equity.

00:34:36,135 --> 00:34:39,117
I don't want any equity.
That is a real offer,

00:34:39,117 --> 00:34:40,126
and I think that actually

00:34:40,126 --> 00:34:42,122
encapsulates the risk
I've got here.

00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:43,143
I need to get
this capital back

00:34:43,143 --> 00:34:47,128
before this little fad ends,
my friend. That's--
I'll tell you, I think

00:34:47,128 --> 00:34:49,135
even for you, back when
you were eating in college,

00:34:49,135 --> 00:34:52,120
they ate ramen noodles,
and so--
hey, I ate ramen noodles.

00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,128
I get it.
Yeah.

00:34:53,128 --> 00:34:55,120
But I didn't need to spend
5 bucks to get this bowl.

00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,124
I figured it out on my own.

00:34:56,124 --> 00:34:59,133
Well, I think
that you are fantastic.

00:34:59,133 --> 00:35:03,137
I personally am concerned about
somebody else trying to do this.

00:35:03,137 --> 00:35:06,126
That's one of my worries
for you.

00:35:06,126 --> 00:35:10,117
So I'm not going to
personally invest.

I'm sorry. I'm out.

I--thank--
I appreciate you.

Chris, I tasted this,
fully expecting it to be mushy,

00:35:16,141 --> 00:35:19,128
because I have tried
to save three minutes

00:35:19,128 --> 00:35:21,118
on many occasions in
sticking it in the microwave,

00:35:21,118 --> 00:35:22,130
and it doesn't work.

00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:26,142
This tastes exactly the same
as if I cooked it on the stove.

00:35:26,142 --> 00:35:30,130
But I'm not totally sold this is
gonna make you a ton of money.

00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,135
It's a onetime sale.

00:35:32,135 --> 00:35:35,125
I feel badly saying "no" to you
because I like you a lot.

00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:37,138
I feel like Lori, for God sakes.
"I like you a lot."

00:35:37,138 --> 00:35:39,138
(Laughs)
But I'm out.

00:35:43,117 --> 00:35:46,129
Chris, I love the story
how you got here.

00:35:46,129 --> 00:35:48,123
I love the fact you did it
on your own.

A guy offered to buy my company
for $5 million.

00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:52,126
I thought it was all the money
in the world.

00:35:52,126 --> 00:35:54,137
I came home. I told my wife
I'm taking the offer.

00:35:54,137 --> 00:35:56,133
I had the papers,
and my wife said, "why?

00:35:56,133 --> 00:35:58,116
You don't believe in yourself
enough?"

00:35:58,116 --> 00:36:00,119
I turned the offer down

00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:03,126
because my wife believed in me
more than I believed in myself.

00:36:03,126 --> 00:36:06,121
I'm gonna start crying.
And a few years later,
I sold it for $100 million.

00:36:06,121 --> 00:36:09,118
Chris,
my only issue with this is

00:36:09,118 --> 00:36:10,143

you understand the nuances

We gotta get some cash
along the way.

Come into my deal, and I'll drop
the royalty in perpetuity

00:38:12,471 --> 00:38:14,491
down to 40 cents,
but I'm keeping it a buck 10.

Uh, as far as a royalty that
exceeds the cost of the product,

00:38:25,484 --> 00:38:26,494
uh, but no equity.

00:38:26,494 --> 00:38:31,492

40% of the company,

Kevin, let's lower
the dollar amount per product

and lower the equity.
Okay, we're gonna drop it down
to 70 cents?

Let's take it to 25% equity

Mr. Wonderful,
as far as your--

that--that offer--
well, I wanna tell you,
Robert and I decided

00:39:03,485 --> 00:39:06,492
to get together, because we see
merits in both of our deals.
(Robert) Yeah.

00:39:06,492 --> 00:39:09,481
I like the idea of getting
some money along the way,

00:39:09,481 --> 00:39:12,488
but I like having equity also.
So here's the good news.

00:39:12,488 --> 00:39:15,496
We're gonna go in it together.
We've lowered the equity amount

00:39:15,496 --> 00:39:21,467
down to 25%, and we've lowered
the royalty to 75 cents

00:39:21,467 --> 00:39:23,491
until we get the $300,000 back,

00:39:23,491 --> 00:39:27,493
and after that,
25 cents off every box.

00:39:27,493 --> 00:39:30,495
It reflects the risk
in your deal,

00:39:30,495 --> 00:39:32,491
and it provides you
with the capital you need,

00:39:32,491 --> 00:39:33,496
and one way or another,

00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,486

capitalize this business.

Well, well, it siphons the cash
as we're growing.

00:39:40,486 --> 00:39:43,474
Let--let me ask a question.
Tell me what you think

00:39:43,474 --> 00:39:45,472
is the most realistic number
that you can do

00:39:45,472 --> 00:39:47,474
for the $300,000?

00:39:47,474 --> 00:39:50,487
For the $300,000, the--
the worst I would go is 20%.

00:39:50,487 --> 00:39:53,479
Okay, but, Chris,
I look at the risks.

00:39:53,479 --> 00:39:56,472
I want my capital back sooner
than you wanna give it to me.

00:39:56,472 --> 00:39:57,483
So I'm putting a mechanism
in place,

00:39:57,483 --> 00:39:59,471
and Robert and I both agree.

00:39:59,471 --> 00:40:01,479
I wasn't hot on the equity.
He is.

00:40:01,479 --> 00:40:03,475
So we've married
these two offers together

00:40:03,475 --> 00:40:05,483
to reflect both
of our interests

00:40:05,483 --> 00:40:08,478
and provide you
with the capital you need.

00:40:08,478 --> 00:40:11,479

This is your moment. Yes or no?

Nope.

the same I do

my "Shark Tank" companies.

Right? Which is
significantly less--
you know what?

The offers are
practically identical.
No, they're not.

00:40:46,489 --> 00:40:47,494
Because you're paying back
the debt

00:40:47,494 --> 00:40:50,477
that we're providing you
in a different way.

00:40:50,477 --> 00:40:52,494
Chris, the beauty of the deal
with royalty--

00:40:52,494 --> 00:40:55,473
it's just a different form
of interest.

00:40:55,473 --> 00:40:57,479

of sales.
Completely--
no, here's where--Chris.

00:41:02,471 --> 00:41:05,469
You have debt.
You owe this guy $150,000.

That is forever

he owns the rapid ramen cooker.

00:41:09,496 --> 00:41:12,467
That's the evil of debt.
But the difference--

00:41:12,467 --> 00:41:14,494
the difference is if
your growth is explosive,

it's going to be,

00:41:17,469 --> 00:41:20,487
