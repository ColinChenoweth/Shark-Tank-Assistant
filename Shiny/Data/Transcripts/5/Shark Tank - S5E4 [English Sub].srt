I'm not very familiar

00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:05,972
Let me try to explain it

00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,607
I have--
  I have a lot of experience,

00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,309
'cause when we did audionet,
  which turned into broadcast.Com,

00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,544
we started
  the streaming business.

00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:13,480
What happens is, R Dub creates
  his show, "Slow jams,"

00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,616
and he goes to radio stations,
  when he says,

00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:20,220
"Look, I'm gonna give you
  this amazing content for free.

00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,290
"what I'm gonna get in return
  are radio commercials

00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,258
that you'll run,
  that I'll sell."

00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:26,960

  'x' number of listeners,

so my spot's worth
  'x' number of dollars per Spot."

00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,299
Then he goes out there
  and tries to sell 'em.

00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:33,967
(Kevin) it immediately leads
  to this question--

00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:37,170
if I take a map of America,
  which Markets do you not have?

00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,207

  barely tapped the potential.

00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,645

  my investor hat on, saying...
  here we go.

00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:47,647

  growth potential here.
  Yeah.

00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,182

00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:06,086

00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:17,964

does listen to their ipods

00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:21,401

00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,036

00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,437
that you could reach

00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:28,108

We're asking for $100,000

00:10:57,984 --> 00:11:01,187
When skateboarding
  was first invented,

00:11:01,187 --> 00:11:04,090
the idea was to get
  a piece of wood

00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:06,926

  when you rode it.

Let me tell you how we did it.

00:11:15,902 --> 00:11:17,704
A few years back,
  I had five little grommets

00:11:17,704 --> 00:11:19,205
running around the house,

00:11:19,205 --> 00:11:21,040

  how to surf.

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,309
One of the things I wanted
  to add to the process

00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:24,511
of teaching them how to surf

00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:26,446
was to make
  a really large skateboard.

00:11:26,446 --> 00:11:28,581
What I ended up making
  was something

00:11:28,581 --> 00:11:30,617
that really didn't work
  that well.

00:11:30,617 --> 00:11:34,154
Thank god, one night,
  one of my little brothers

00:11:34,154 --> 00:11:36,823
left the giant skateboard
  out in the driveway,

00:11:36,823 --> 00:11:39,092
and my mom backed over it
  in the family wagon.

00:11:39,092 --> 00:11:41,361
When we jumped on it,
  we actually realized,

00:11:41,361 --> 00:11:43,763
hey, this thing feels like
  surfing for the first time.

00:11:43,763 --> 00:11:45,799
And what she had done
  when she had backed over it

00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:47,867
was she had modified
  the trucks

00:11:47,867 --> 00:11:49,569
so that it turned better.

00:11:49,569 --> 00:11:52,639
My dad figured out
  a way to replicate that,

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,941
and we started making
  boards for ourselves

00:11:54,941 --> 00:11:57,443
and riding them
  all over Huntington Beach.

00:11:57,443 --> 00:11:59,779

  People wanted to buy 'em.

00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:01,181
And so the next thing you knew,

00:12:01,181 --> 00:12:02,949
we had a little business
  in our garage,

00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:04,484
making these
  giant skateboards.

00:12:04,484 --> 00:12:08,221
But I didn't really know
  the business dynamics.

00:12:08,221 --> 00:12:09,856
You know, 'cause Gus
  and his brothers,

00:12:09,856 --> 00:12:11,891
they're all lifeguards.
  I'm a fireman.

00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:14,861
So we were kind of hitting
  some rough waters.

00:12:14,861 --> 00:12:18,832
So we shook the family tree,
  and Donnie fell out...

00:12:18,832 --> 00:12:21,467
(laughing)
  And we hit the ground
  running.

00:12:21,467 --> 00:12:24,704
These guys are terrific
  at product and promotions,

00:12:24,704 --> 00:12:26,773
but the first time I had
  a real business meeting,

00:12:26,773 --> 00:12:29,209
we went through the "cost
  to goods sold" Spreadsheet,

00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:31,778
and about an hour in,
  these guys needed

00:12:31,778 --> 00:12:34,747
a yoga break
  and a 20-Minute nap.

00:12:34,747 --> 00:12:37,217

  to make that?

00:15:09,997 --> 00:15:11,665
How much does it cost
  to make it?
  One-Third of that.

00:15:11,665 --> 00:15:13,234
So $200?
  Roughly speaking.

00:15:13,234 --> 00:15:16,003
Okay. And where--
  Where do you make them?

00:15:16,003 --> 00:15:18,906
Everything is assembled
  and built in Huntington Beach.

00:15:18,906 --> 00:15:20,841
Okay.
  (Lori)
  I think, very cool product.

00:15:20,841 --> 00:15:22,776
Love family businesses.

00:15:22,776 --> 00:15:26,013
But it seems to me
  more of a niche product,

00:15:26,013 --> 00:15:28,782
maybe more coastal
  than heartland.

00:15:28,782 --> 00:15:31,018
I think I can get you excited
  for a bigger Market

00:15:31,018 --> 00:15:33,521
if I can walk back here and pull
  something else out of here.

00:15:33,521 --> 00:15:34,889
Okay.
  Sure.

00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:37,024
(Robert) There's more?
  There's more.

00:15:37,024 --> 00:15:39,126
(Pete) Wait.
  So...

00:15:39,126 --> 00:15:42,863
hamboard Plus land paddle
  equals freedom.

00:15:42,863 --> 00:15:44,698
Oh!

00:15:44,698 --> 00:15:46,033
Interesting.
  (Pete) Check this out.

00:15:46,033 --> 00:15:47,368
(Gus) So...

00:15:47,368 --> 00:15:49,770
ah.
  Oh, wow.

00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,438
Cool.

00:15:51,438 --> 00:15:53,240
Whoo!

00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,076
And that is how you
  commute to work?

00:15:56,076 --> 00:15:57,144
Yes.
  That's right.

00:15:57,144 --> 00:15:58,412
(Lori) Very cool product.

00:15:58,412 --> 00:16:00,514
Think you guys are great,
  and Innovation's great.

00:16:00,514 --> 00:16:04,685
I personally feel
  it's maybe coastal,

00:16:04,685 --> 00:16:06,620
more, in popularity,

00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,455
and more of a niche Market,

00:16:08,455 --> 00:16:09,990
and so for that reason...

00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,459
Mm-hmm.
  I'm out.

00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:14,862
Thanks.

00:16:14,862 --> 00:16:15,930
What's your core competency?

00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,032
What's gonna make you
  a great company?

00:16:18,032 --> 00:16:19,700
Our honest hope is

00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:24,338
that we get to start
  with this terrific product

00:16:24,338 --> 00:16:27,408
that really connects with people
  that love the surf culture,

00:16:27,408 --> 00:16:29,410
and then we get
  to extend that--

00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,645
see, But just saying that you
  extend surf culture elsewhere

00:16:31,645 --> 00:16:33,080
isn't big enough.

00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,216
You've got to tell me
  how you expand beyond that,

00:16:36,216 --> 00:16:38,185
because you've got to get
  to the point where you're

00:16:38,185 --> 00:16:40,955
selling 10,000
  or 20,000 or 30 th--

00:16:40,955 --> 00:16:42,590
I mean,
  with tower paddle boards--

00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:44,692
they're
  online Marketing gurus.

00:16:44,692 --> 00:16:46,360
We went from doing
  $40,000

00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,896
to we'll do probably
  $3 million this year.

00:16:48,896 --> 00:16:52,199
I wasn't interested until you
  brought the land paddles, right?

00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:54,201
Right.
  Because
  now all of a sudden

00:16:54,201 --> 00:16:56,270
there's stand-Up paddleboard
  for water.

00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,938
Now there's stand-Up
  paddleboard for land.

00:16:57,938 --> 00:16:59,006
Yeah.
  Exactly.

00:16:59,006 --> 00:17:00,307
I can get that,
  but if you're telling me

00:17:00,307 --> 00:17:01,809
this is all about
  surfing culture...
  well--

00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:03,377
That's not gonna resonate
  with a 13-year-old kid

00:17:03,377 --> 00:17:04,878
on a lake outside of Dallas.

00:17:07,681 --> 00:17:08,816
I'm out.

00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:14,722
I'm not worried about
  the culture issue as much,

00:17:14,722 --> 00:17:17,625
because there is a very large
  skateboard industry.

00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,827
You can define it in hundreds
  of millions of dollars.

00:17:19,827 --> 00:17:22,596
You have to figure out how to
  get some percentage share of it.
  Mm-hmm.

00:17:22,596 --> 00:17:25,265
Had you shown me
  that you've found that model

00:17:25,265 --> 00:17:28,535
and that you were starting
  at $250,000 in sales

00:17:28,535 --> 00:17:30,104
and you have a path
  to $20 million,

00:17:30,104 --> 00:17:32,072
and all you need
  is my gasoline

00:17:32,072 --> 00:17:34,742
in the form of dollars
  to pour on it,

00:17:34,742 --> 00:17:36,443
I made have made
  an investment here today.

00:17:36,443 --> 00:17:38,278
But you don't have that.

00:17:38,278 --> 00:17:40,681
So I'm out.

00:17:45,786 --> 00:17:47,788
I-I have a level of interest
  in it.

00:17:47,788 --> 00:17:50,290
I'm--I'm--I'm looking
  at this as something

00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:53,694
for us to go out and license,
  and I--it would be a big gamble.

00:17:53,694 --> 00:17:55,963
The objective is for me
  to go out and help

00:17:55,963 --> 00:17:58,298
and assist to license
  this product immediately,

00:17:58,298 --> 00:18:01,001
fast, and get it out there.

00:18:01,001 --> 00:18:02,569
Are you making an offer?

00:18:02,569 --> 00:18:04,605
Yes. $100,000 for 30%.

00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:10,010

  as a licensing thing today.

from two huge sharks.

00:19:40,634 --> 00:19:43,370
So my angle is to go and do
  a lot of licenses

00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,039
to build this up on
  people's existing machines.

00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:47,975
Robert is basically

00:23:08,508 --> 00:23:11,345
Hi, sharks.
  My name is Garrett Gee,

00:23:11,345 --> 00:23:13,814
and my company is scan.

00:23:13,814 --> 00:23:17,451
I'm here seeking an investment
  of $1 million

00:23:17,451 --> 00:23:18,852
for 5% of my company.

00:23:21,355 --> 00:23:24,124
Now, sharks, before you
  grill me with your questions,

00:23:24,124 --> 00:23:26,259
I have a question for you.

00:23:26,259 --> 00:23:28,095
How often
  in your day-To-Day lives

00:23:28,095 --> 00:23:30,097
do you see one of these
  scannable codes?

00:23:30,097 --> 00:23:31,765
They're everywhere.

00:23:31,765 --> 00:23:34,034
At scan, we developed
  a mobile app

00:23:34,034 --> 00:23:37,270
which is the easiest way
  to scan and interact

00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:40,007
with any of these codes.
  Let me show you how.

00:23:40,007 --> 00:23:42,676
So first I'm going to scan
  the barcode

00:23:42,676 --> 00:23:44,111
from this camera's packaging.

00:23:44,111 --> 00:23:47,280
It's as easy as...
  (beep)

00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,649
and that quickly, my app
  just did a price check

00:23:49,649 --> 00:23:53,153
showing me
  how I can save $25.

00:23:53,153 --> 00:23:55,722
Next, I'm going to scan
  the Q.R. Code

00:23:55,722 --> 00:23:58,125
from the tag
  of this mission belt.

00:23:58,125 --> 00:23:59,860
Daymond, have you heard
  of this company before?
  (laughing)

00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,228
Yes. Mission belt.
  Great company.

00:24:01,228 --> 00:24:03,697
Then you're going
  to love this.

00:24:04,965 --> 00:24:06,400
(beep)

00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,901
They, using our Web site,

00:24:07,901 --> 00:24:09,436
created their own
  custom Code

00:24:09,436 --> 00:24:11,171
that can Link
  to their Web site,

00:24:11,171 --> 00:24:13,573
their youtube channel
  for a video.

00:24:13,573 --> 00:24:15,108
Do you want somebody
  to actually be able

00:24:15,108 --> 00:24:16,710
to purchase a product?

00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:19,346
Or, as you see here,
  their twitter.

00:24:19,346 --> 00:24:22,649
So in one tap, that easily,
  I just followed them on twitter.

00:24:22,649 --> 00:24:24,418
How cool is that?

00:24:24,418 --> 00:24:27,120
This all started
  just two years ago.

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,989
Together with
  two of my classmates,

00:24:28,989 --> 00:24:31,725
we set out on a mission
  to connect the real world

00:24:31,725 --> 00:24:33,293
with the digital universe.

00:24:33,293 --> 00:24:36,596
We are still young
  and foolish enough

00:24:36,596 --> 00:24:38,098
to believe that we can
  change the world

00:24:38,098 --> 00:24:40,200
from our college
  dorm room.

00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,469
So, sharks, which of you

00:24:42,469 --> 00:24:45,705
is still young and foolish
  enough to take a chance on us?

00:24:47,867 --> 00:24:50,936
Garrett, what do you have today?
  What's built?

00:24:50,936 --> 00:24:52,571
We have our mobile app,
  which is available

00:24:52,571 --> 00:24:53,939
in the app store,

00:24:53,939 --> 00:24:56,108
iphone, ipad, ipod,

00:24:56,108 --> 00:24:57,777
android devices,
  and windows.

00:24:57,777 --> 00:24:59,445
Is it free?
  When we started,

00:24:59,445 --> 00:25:01,313
we were focusing on growing
  our user base,

00:25:01,313 --> 00:25:03,082
and so we started
  with a free app,

00:25:03,082 --> 00:25:04,250
kept it very simple.

00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,985
It grew like crazy,
  and over time,

00:25:05,985 --> 00:25:07,686
as the company has grown,

00:25:07,686 --> 00:25:09,989
we've started to introduce
  better features

00:25:09,989 --> 00:25:11,524
that users can pay for.

00:25:11,524 --> 00:25:13,259
What's the most common
  application

00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:14,994
that the enterprises,
  the businesses,

00:25:14,994 --> 00:25:17,263
are doing on the site
  with the application?

00:25:17,263 --> 00:25:19,765
A lot of people are going
  for the simple choices

00:25:19,765 --> 00:25:21,133
to begin with.

00:25:21,133 --> 00:25:22,635
They're saying,
  "Here's our Q.R. Code,

00:25:22,635 --> 00:25:24,170
"and it links
  to our facebook page

00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:25,971
so you can 'like' us,"
  or "It links to our instagram."

00:25:25,971 --> 00:25:28,040
Very easy stuff.

00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,642
I create a Q.R. Code

00:25:29,642 --> 00:25:32,711
that links to the actual
  product and its price.

00:25:32,711 --> 00:25:34,480
So now I don't just
  scan this belt

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,483
and get more information,
  I can scan this belt

00:25:37,483 --> 00:25:39,518
and purchase it in one tap.

00:25:39,518 --> 00:25:41,520
How many active users
  does it have?

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,955
Actually, let me check.

00:25:42,955 --> 00:25:45,224
I don't want
  to tell you wrong.

00:25:45,224 --> 00:25:47,126
All right, so here is
  a live ticker

00:25:47,126 --> 00:25:49,261
Showing people downloading
  our app.

00:25:49,261 --> 00:25:51,597
We get about a little more
  than one a second.

00:25:51,597 --> 00:25:53,866
51 million downloads?
  That doesn't say anything.

00:25:53,866 --> 00:25:55,534
How many scans
  do you have a day?

00:25:55,534 --> 00:25:59,705
I can tell you that last month,
  there were 27 million people

00:25:59,705 --> 00:26:02,775
who took out our app
  and scanned it.

00:26:02,775 --> 00:26:04,677
do you have any competition
  for this?

00:26:04,677 --> 00:26:08,080
This wasn't, like,
  the newest, best idea.

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,915
But when I looked
  at the other competition,

00:26:09,915 --> 00:26:11,750
I didn't see anybody
  executing on it

00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,186
how I felt it needed
  to be executed.

00:26:14,186 --> 00:26:15,688
Garrett, what does it
  do better?

00:26:15,688 --> 00:26:18,090
One mistake that a lot
  of our competition have made

00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:20,693
is they kind of built
  half of the table.

00:26:20,693 --> 00:26:24,263
They didn't build the full
  360 experience like we did.

00:26:24,263 --> 00:26:26,031
Because people can go
  to our Web site

00:26:26,031 --> 00:26:27,333
and create codes,

00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:30,603
and people can use
  our own app,

00:26:30,603 --> 00:26:33,706
we're the entire space.

00:26:33,706 --> 00:26:35,341
How do you make money
  with this?

00:26:35,341 --> 00:26:38,110
That's why I'm here.
  We're just now starting

00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:40,679
to focus more and more
  on monetization.

00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:43,916
The plan is to keep a lot of
  the user side of Things

00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:45,351
completely free.

00:26:45,351 --> 00:26:47,486
And then, for businesses,
  they can come,

00:26:47,486 --> 00:26:49,555
choose what type of Code
  they want to create,

00:26:49,555 --> 00:26:52,024
pay a monthly fee
  to host that code

00:26:52,024 --> 00:26:54,393
and keep it live
  and Working, and--

00:26:54,393 --> 00:26:56,262
has there been monetization
  up until this point?

00:26:56,262 --> 00:26:57,930
Not on the live Web site.

00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,698
If you went
  to our Web site right now,

00:26:59,698 --> 00:27:02,201
you would not see, uh...

00:27:02,201 --> 00:27:03,936
have you made any money today?

00:27:03,936 --> 00:27:06,538
So we've made about
  $30,000 a month

00:27:06,538 --> 00:27:09,074
for the last few months
  by reaching out

00:27:09,074 --> 00:27:10,542
to a few
  of our big companies

00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:12,111
that have already been using
  our product and then say,

00:27:12,111 --> 00:27:14,079
"We want to choose you
  as a beta customer"...

00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:16,148
and they're paying you
  for the beta?

00:27:16,148 --> 00:27:18,684
Correct.

00:27:19,885 --> 00:27:21,654
Are-aren't you concerned
  that Q.R. Codes

00:27:21,654 --> 00:27:23,455
are becoming dodo birds?

00:27:23,455 --> 00:27:25,024
What's the future?
  Because, I mean,

00:27:25,024 --> 00:27:27,059
I can make an argument
  that Q.R. Codes are gone.

00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:28,594
Can I show you?
  Yeah, absolutely.

00:27:28,594 --> 00:27:30,496
I'm gonna show you
  something special

00:27:30,496 --> 00:27:32,331
we've been working on.

00:27:32,331 --> 00:27:36,535
So I received a package
  just the other day from google.

00:27:38,203 --> 00:27:40,372
So this is google glass.

00:27:40,372 --> 00:27:43,642
Okay, glass, scan this
  Q.R. Code.

00:27:46,378 --> 00:27:48,914
That easily I can interact
  with the digital world.

00:27:50,382 --> 00:27:53,118
So that's it?
  That's what you did there?

00:27:53,118 --> 00:27:55,955
Like, all you showed me there--
  as--as a tech guy--

00:27:55,955 --> 00:27:57,990
Was just another
  hardware platform.

00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:00,492
But google sent this to you
  to do what?

00:28:00,492 --> 00:28:03,095
To start implementing
  our scanning technology

00:28:03,095 --> 00:28:05,364
on both the business side
  and the user side

00:28:05,364 --> 00:28:07,132
into their hardware.

00:28:07,132 --> 00:28:09,735
Not impressed.
  Not impressed.

00:28:09,735 --> 00:28:11,603
I'm impressed by
  the 51 million downloads

00:28:11,603 --> 00:28:13,138
and your users--
  That's great, right?

00:28:13,138 --> 00:28:15,007
But you're not telling me
  you're doing anything unique.

00:28:15,007 --> 00:28:16,542
You've got a platform,
  google goggles.

00:28:16,542 --> 00:28:17,977
They have
  a developers' program.

00:28:17,977 --> 00:28:19,645
There's gonna be other people
  doing scannables.

00:28:19,645 --> 00:28:23,015
You haven't said what it is
  that you're doing

00:28:23,015 --> 00:28:26,652
that differentiates you
  from any of the many.

00:28:26,652 --> 00:28:28,687
You know, are you doing
  something better with software?

00:28:28,687 --> 00:28:30,456
Are you better integration
  with third parties?

00:28:30,456 --> 00:28:31,890
Is your a.P.I. Easier?

00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:33,292
The things
  you were talking about--

00:28:33,292 --> 00:28:35,294
like, our a.P.I.
  Was easier to work with,

00:28:35,294 --> 00:28:37,162
the scan was just
  that much faster.
  (snaps fingers)

00:28:37,162 --> 00:28:39,765
the design was just that much
  more simple and beautiful.

00:28:39,765 --> 00:28:41,867
It was very small things
  that people don't think

00:28:41,867 --> 00:28:43,702
they care about,
  so when we went out

00:28:43,702 --> 00:28:45,704
against a huge competition,

00:28:45,704 --> 00:28:48,240
we were able
  to rise to the top.

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,442
How much money has been
  invested in your company

00:28:50,442 --> 00:28:51,944
over the last two years?

00:28:51,944 --> 00:28:54,079
When we were six months
  into the business,

00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:55,848
we had already passed
  one million downloads.

00:28:55,848 --> 00:28:58,183
We started to hear
  from investors.

00:28:58,183 --> 00:29:01,754
To be honest, I didn't know
  a lot about investors.

00:29:01,754 --> 00:29:04,723
And where did I learn
  so much of the stuff initially?

00:29:04,723 --> 00:29:06,025
From "Shark Tank."

00:29:06,025 --> 00:29:08,427
And when google ventures
  wanted to meet with us,

00:29:08,427 --> 00:29:09,995
I was, like,
  in "Shark Tank" Mode,

00:29:09,995 --> 00:29:12,364
and I said, "I'm looking
  for this much money,

00:29:12,364 --> 00:29:14,666
and I want this,
  deal or no deal."

00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:17,536
And they looked at me and said,
  "That's not how this works."

00:29:17,536 --> 00:29:19,071
But I learned
  from that experience,

00:29:19,071 --> 00:29:20,572
and I kept going at it,

00:29:20,572 --> 00:29:23,175
so total, we've raised
  $8.7 million.

00:29:30,716 --> 00:29:33,552
(Daymond)
  8.7 raised already.

00:29:33,552 --> 00:29:36,088
Why are you exactly here?

00:29:36,088 --> 00:29:37,956
Is it just for exposure?

00:29:37,956 --> 00:29:39,992
No. Definitely not.

00:29:39,992 --> 00:29:42,094
Every time we've
  involved somebody,

00:29:42,094 --> 00:29:44,530
we give somebody
  this much of the business,

00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,298
and they deliver us
  this much value.

00:29:46,298 --> 00:29:48,867
I believe the carpet is there

00:29:48,867 --> 00:29:51,036
for those who desperately
  need help,

00:29:51,036 --> 00:29:52,738
the banks turned them down,
  they've lost a lot,

00:29:52,738 --> 00:29:55,507
or they--they don't have
  any hope.

00:29:55,507 --> 00:29:58,444
I don't think you need
  the money. I'm out.

00:30:02,014 --> 00:30:04,983
I think you are amazing.
  You obviously are brilliant.

00:30:04,983 --> 00:30:08,654
But I am not the best person
  sitting here

00:30:08,654 --> 00:30:10,322
to help you
  in this technical Arena.

00:30:10,322 --> 00:30:13,926
So for that reason,
  I'm going out.

00:30:13,926 --> 00:30:16,795
It hurts every time.
  (chuckles)

00:30:21,033 --> 00:30:24,002
Garrett, I gotta tell you,
  we've never had somebody

00:30:24,002 --> 00:30:26,071
ask for a million dollars
  in flip-flops.

00:30:26,071 --> 00:30:28,073
Oh.
  So--but that's cool.

00:30:28,073 --> 00:30:29,808
(laughs)
  Um... look,

00:30:29,808 --> 00:30:31,910
there's no doubting
  the downloads.

00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:34,346
Unbelievably impressive.

00:30:34,346 --> 00:30:36,181
But there's nothing
  proprietary,

00:30:36,181 --> 00:30:39,651
and I worry about
  the competition as it grows.

00:30:39,651 --> 00:30:41,320
For that reason, I'm out.

00:30:43,021 --> 00:30:45,124
Your valuation is $20 million

00:30:45,124 --> 00:30:47,659
for a business that actually
  doesn't have yet

00:30:47,659 --> 00:30:51,663
a business model
  that is recurring.

00:30:53,365 --> 00:30:56,101
So the leap of faith
  for any shark

00:30:56,101 --> 00:30:58,837
is just risk tolerance,
  I think. That's it.

00:30:58,837 --> 00:31:02,441
I can't make that leap of faith.

00:31:02,441 --> 00:31:05,477
Show me the money,
  not the downloads.

00:31:05,477 --> 00:31:07,012
I'm out.

00:31:09,815 --> 00:31:11,183
I've notice a pattern.

00:31:11,183 --> 00:31:13,252
As I've been meeting
  with investors,

00:31:13,252 --> 00:31:15,154
there have been those
  that look at me,

00:31:15,154 --> 00:31:17,122
and those who look
  at my numbers.

00:31:17,122 --> 00:31:19,558
There's investors that think
  there's a perfect recipe

00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:22,394
to success every time.
  I don't believe in that.

00:31:22,394 --> 00:31:24,830
I believe, to do something
  truly amazing,

00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,231
there's got to be
  a little bit of crazy,

00:31:26,231 --> 00:31:27,900
a little bit of foolish.

00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,035
You're--You're giving me
  a lot of visions,

00:31:30,035 --> 00:31:33,172
but you're not giving me
  a lot of realities.

00:31:33,172 --> 00:31:34,840
I'm a big fan
  of the sensor business.

00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,009
I think that's the future
  of technology.

00:31:37,009 --> 00:31:39,278
The fundamental problem
  that I have is

00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:40,812
scans versus sensors.

00:31:40,812 --> 00:31:42,748
In a sensor-Driven world,
  the information

00:31:42,748 --> 00:31:45,884
is accumulated and gathered
  everywhere

00:31:45,884 --> 00:31:48,120
with No action by the user,

00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,088
whereas in your world,

00:31:50,088 --> 00:31:52,491
whether it's google glasses
  where you have to talk,

00:31:52,491 --> 00:31:54,426
whether you have to take
  your phone and scan,

00:31:54,426 --> 00:31:58,830
in a sensor-Driven world,
  these don't exist.

00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,866
So for that reason,
  I'm out.

00:32:04,102 --> 00:32:05,938
Thank you very much
  for all of your time.

00:32:05,938 --> 00:32:07,072
Very impressive, Garrett.

00:32:07,072 --> 00:32:08,073
Yes, very impressive.
  Very impressive.

00:32:08,073 --> 00:32:09,074
Great job.
  Good luck.

00:32:09,074 --> 00:32:10,642
Thank you.
  Thanks, Garrett.

00:32:10,642 --> 00:32:12,578
Look what "Shark Tank"
  Is producing--

00:32:12,578 --> 00:32:14,012
Kids like that.
  Amazing, right?

00:32:14,012 --> 00:32:15,214
Yes, very impressive.
  Amazing.

00:32:15,214 --> 00:32:16,582
I'm scared.
  Brilliant guy.

00:32:16,582 --> 00:32:18,917
(Daymond) I'm very, very proud.
  Now... I want a royalty.

00:32:18,917 --> 00:32:20,352

  Investing in our company,

00:32:21,954 --> 00:32:24,923
and especially in us young guys
  that are running this company

00:32:24,923 --> 00:32:27,292
is definitely
  a big leap of faith.

00:32:27,292 --> 00:32:29,194
But that's the part
  I like about it.

00:32:29,194 --> 00:32:31,763

Sharks, we're seeking

(all) Screenmend.

00:33:04,129 --> 00:33:05,697
"What's Screenmend?",
  you ask?

00:33:05,697 --> 00:33:08,166
It's the easiest way
  to patch A screen ever.

00:33:08,166 --> 00:33:10,102
Screenmend was invented
  about three years ago.

00:33:10,102 --> 00:33:13,105
When my mom made us
  clean out the porch.

00:33:13,105 --> 00:33:15,307
I was trying to patch
  a hole in the porch screen

00:33:15,307 --> 00:33:17,609
with a self-Adhesive patch,
  but it wasn't working.

00:33:17,609 --> 00:33:19,678
He just kept trying
  to press the patch on,

00:33:19,678 --> 00:33:21,146
and it kept falling off.

00:33:21,146 --> 00:33:23,615
Lily was trying to scrape
  some melted wax off the table.

00:33:23,615 --> 00:33:25,217
I hate that job.

00:33:25,217 --> 00:33:26,918
Well, when our dad
  complained about

00:33:26,918 --> 00:33:29,087
how the patch wouldn't stick,
  Lily said...

00:33:29,087 --> 00:33:31,256
"Hey, brain"--
  our nickname for our dad--

00:33:31,256 --> 00:33:32,758
"Why don't you put wax
  on that patch?"

00:33:32,758 --> 00:33:35,060
We realized Lily might be
  on to something,

00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,863
so we tried creating
  a screen patch soaked in wax.

00:33:37,863 --> 00:33:39,097
And it worked.

00:33:39,097 --> 00:33:40,766
When the first patch
  stayed on for over a year,

00:33:40,766 --> 00:33:42,834
we realized that we had
  created a simple

00:33:42,834 --> 00:33:45,504
and Marketable solution
  to a common household problem.

00:33:47,005 --> 00:33:49,408
Thanks, Emma.

00:33:49,408 --> 00:33:50,809

(laughter)
  "Brain."

00:33:59,017 --> 00:34:00,919
Simply cut the patch to size

00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:02,654
and apply with heat
  from a hair Dryer

00:34:02,654 --> 00:34:04,589
for 30 to 60 seconds.

00:34:04,589 --> 00:34:07,793
(whirring)

00:34:07,793 --> 00:34:10,162
now that's on the hottest
  temperature, right?

00:34:10,162 --> 00:34:11,263
Yes.
  Yes, it is.

00:34:13,432 --> 00:34:14,700
(hair Dryer turns off)

00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,268
and you're done.

00:34:16,268 --> 00:34:19,705
Screenmend is fast, easy,
  and extremely effective.

00:34:19,705 --> 00:34:22,708
Sharks, we built this business
  from the ground up,

00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:24,042
and now we need your help.

00:34:24,042 --> 00:34:25,544
I want to grow my business

00:34:25,544 --> 00:34:27,879

Sometimes
  the simplest products

00:34:35,187 --> 00:34:37,489
make the best products,
  because...
  Yeah, it really,
  really helped us,

00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:39,891
because we had, um,
  we had a Bunny...

00:34:39,891 --> 00:34:41,626
(laughs)
  And she would just
  eat through the screens.

00:34:41,626 --> 00:34:43,628
This is Bunny-Proof?
  Yeah.

00:34:43,628 --> 00:34:46,631
(laughter)
  Lily, do you mind asking
  how old you are?

00:34:46,631 --> 00:34:49,201
I'm 12.
  I'm 15.

00:34:50,202 --> 00:34:52,104
How many of these
  have you sold?

00:34:52,104 --> 00:34:53,605
750.

00:34:53,605 --> 00:34:56,541
750 units?
  Yes.

00:34:56,541 --> 00:34:58,076
Brian, what do you
  sell them for?

00:34:58,076 --> 00:34:59,578
$6.95.

00:34:59,578 --> 00:35:01,012
What does it cost you
  to make it?

00:35:01,012 --> 00:35:02,013
31 cents.

00:35:02,013 --> 00:35:03,648
(Lori) Wow.
  Nice. Good job.

00:35:03,648 --> 00:35:05,951
That's a nice margin.
  You need bigger margins.

00:35:05,951 --> 00:35:08,086
Where are you manufacturing?

00:35:08,086 --> 00:35:09,955
We've expanded from
  the kitchen to the garage.

00:35:09,955 --> 00:35:12,491
(laughs)
  Who makes the packaging?
  You guys make it all, and--

00:35:12,491 --> 00:35:15,327
Yes. The packaging
  is 53 cents,

00:35:15,327 --> 00:35:17,763
and the materials
  are 31 cents.

00:35:19,064 --> 00:35:21,233
How many competitors
  are out there?

00:35:21,233 --> 00:35:23,802
There's at least three
  or four competitors.

00:35:23,802 --> 00:35:26,204
They're nothing like us,
  though.
  (laughs) You tell 'em.

00:35:26,204 --> 00:35:27,706
They--they just--
  Ours are better.

00:35:27,706 --> 00:35:29,074
Why are you better, Lily?
  Yeah, why are you better?

00:35:29,074 --> 00:35:30,542
Why are you better?

00:35:30,542 --> 00:35:32,010
Well, because ours
  stays on for longer,

00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:34,346
and it's quicker,
  and the other patches

00:35:34,346 --> 00:35:36,014
use, like, tape and stuff.

00:35:36,014 --> 00:35:37,649
(Emma) some of them
  don't stick on Well,

00:35:37,649 --> 00:35:39,951
and then the others, once it's
  exposed to the elements--

00:35:39,951 --> 00:35:41,620
Dust, wind, rain, etcetera--

00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,588
The backing wears off,
  and it falls off.

00:35:43,588 --> 00:35:45,357
And yours does not
  fall off in rain?

00:35:45,357 --> 00:35:46,992
Nope.
  Nope.

00:35:46,992 --> 00:35:48,693
What stops your competitor
  from just doing

00:35:48,693 --> 00:35:50,328
the wax gig you're doing?

00:35:50,328 --> 00:35:52,030
Well, we do have
  a provisional patent.

00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:54,566
So you think that'll survive?
  It'll actually clear?

00:35:54,566 --> 00:35:55,901
Well, we hope to grow

00:35:55,901 --> 00:35:58,170
to be able to afford
  a utility patent.

00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:00,906
Did you do any type
  of patentability search

00:36:00,906 --> 00:36:03,675
to see if there's any prior
  out--out there

00:36:03,675 --> 00:36:05,811
that would preclude you
  from getting a patent?

00:36:05,811 --> 00:36:08,747
Uh, I have not.
  Um, we have invested

00:36:08,747 --> 00:36:11,016
all the capital, um,
  from the business

00:36:11,016 --> 00:36:14,953
back into the business,
  and that's why we're here.

00:36:18,857 --> 00:36:22,294
Lily, why do you need
  the $30,000?

00:36:22,294 --> 00:36:24,396
Um, we would like to grow
  our packaging,

00:36:24,396 --> 00:36:27,199
because we had, um, interest

00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:29,367
from BED bath &amp; beyond
  and home depot,

00:36:29,367 --> 00:36:32,237
but they said they couldn't put
  our products in their store

00:36:32,237 --> 00:36:33,705
because of the packaging.

00:36:33,705 --> 00:36:35,006
The packaging needed work.
  So...

00:36:35,006 --> 00:36:36,808
why?

00:36:36,808 --> 00:36:39,945
Because they can't hang it
  on, like, clips or anything.
  Clip strip.

00:36:39,945 --> 00:36:42,514
And we really didn't know
  where to go from there.

00:36:42,514 --> 00:36:44,983
So the problem is getting this
  into retail,

00:36:44,983 --> 00:36:47,686
which requires
  a packaging redesign.

00:36:47,686 --> 00:36:49,087
Exactly.
  Yes.

00:36:49,087 --> 00:36:50,622
And that's what we need
  help with.

00:36:54,226 --> 00:36:55,861
I think you guys have
  come up with something great,

00:36:55,861 --> 00:36:58,163
and I want to do this deal,

00:36:58,163 --> 00:37:00,065
but I more want to do it
  from the standpoint

00:37:00,065 --> 00:37:01,566
that I'm a dad like you,
  you know?

00:37:01,566 --> 00:37:03,068
And you have two great girls.

00:37:03,068 --> 00:37:05,637
The challenge is
  it's just a lot of work.

00:37:05,637 --> 00:37:07,005
You know, if I give you
  the money

00:37:07,005 --> 00:37:08,240
and you can go off
  and make it happen,

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,674
that's fine, but you need
  the knowledge--

00:37:09,674 --> 00:37:11,176
the packaging, the back office--
  All that stuff,

00:37:11,176 --> 00:37:14,012
and I wouldn't have the time
  to help you with that.

00:37:17,916 --> 00:37:19,351
I'm out.

00:37:19,351 --> 00:37:21,686
I understand. Thank you
  for your consideration.

00:37:21,686 --> 00:37:23,221
Thank you.
  Thank you.

00:37:23,221 --> 00:37:26,858
This business is too small
  for me to invest in.

00:37:26,858 --> 00:37:28,994
It's tugging
  at my heartstrings,

00:37:28,994 --> 00:37:32,864
and I never let that
  influence me as a an investor.

00:37:32,864 --> 00:37:35,333
I'm--I'm profoundly, uh,
  supportive

00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:36,835
of what you're trying to do.

00:37:36,835 --> 00:37:39,838
But to build this business up
  is going to be

00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:41,673
a fair amount of work,

00:37:41,673 --> 00:37:44,743
and I don't want to go on that
  journey with you, unfortunately.

00:37:45,877 --> 00:37:47,078
I'm out.

00:37:47,078 --> 00:37:49,080
All right.

00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,416
Thank you.

00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:53,919
(Robert) Brian, let me tell you
  where I'm at.

00:37:53,919 --> 00:37:56,087
You guys have done
  a great job with this.

00:37:56,087 --> 00:37:57,656
You're going to be successful,

00:37:57,656 --> 00:38:00,091
but I don't see how I can
  invest today

00:38:00,091 --> 00:38:02,961
To help grow my money.
  I'm out.

00:38:09,301 --> 00:38:10,602
(Mark) Look, guys,
  tell you a quick story.

00:38:10,602 --> 00:38:13,171
When I was 16,
  started collecting stamps.

00:38:13,171 --> 00:38:14,539
I went to a stamp show,

00:38:14,539 --> 00:38:16,274
bought a stamp for 50 cents.

00:38:16,274 --> 00:38:18,577
I took that stamp into
  another stamp dealer.

00:38:18,577 --> 00:38:20,278
It turns out
  it was a $50 stamp.

00:38:20,278 --> 00:38:23,481
Boom. I made $49.50
  just like that.

00:38:23,481 --> 00:38:25,517
And I started growing
  my little business,

00:38:25,517 --> 00:38:27,018
and my dad would take me
  to stamp shows.

00:38:27,018 --> 00:38:28,386
He had no idea
  what was going on.

00:38:28,386 --> 00:38:30,322
But he introduced me
  to somebody

00:38:30,322 --> 00:38:32,390
who gave me
  a few thousand dollars.

00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,725
I grew that business
  and grew that business,

00:38:33,725 --> 00:38:34,893
paid his money back,

00:38:34,893 --> 00:38:37,228
and I'll be forever
  grateful to him.

00:38:37,228 --> 00:38:39,731
I'm not gonna let you guys
  not get a deal.

00:38:41,266 --> 00:38:43,368
It's not about the money.

00:38:43,368 --> 00:38:46,571
I'll give you guys $30,000
  for 25%.

00:38:46,571 --> 00:38:48,573
I'm not here to tell you
  I'm--I'm an expert

00:38:48,573 --> 00:38:50,842
in any of this.
  I have no clue.

00:38:50,842 --> 00:38:53,244
But I know how to find
  people that do.

00:38:53,244 --> 00:38:55,213
Somebody stood up for me.
  I'll stand up for you guys.

00:38:55,213 --> 00:38:56,748
Do you want to do a deal?

00:38:56,748 --> 00:38:58,984
(inhales) We would...

00:38:58,984 --> 00:39:00,285
Wait a minute.

00:39:00,285 --> 00:39:02,153
I'm gonna make you an offer.

Seeing himself
  in the young entrepreneurs,

00:39:18,403 --> 00:39:19,871
Mark has offered
  the Hooks family

00:39:19,871 --> 00:39:21,940
exactly what they asked for.

00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,776
I'm not gonna let you guys

I'm gonna make you an offer.

00:39:44,863 --> 00:39:47,799
I love what you did.

00:39:47,799 --> 00:39:49,701
Your ages--Amazing.

00:39:49,701 --> 00:39:52,904
To create something
  that it appears

00:39:52,904 --> 00:39:56,374
that no one else has been
  able to do as well--

00:39:56,374 --> 00:40:00,145
We're talking major corporations
  with millions of dollars.

00:40:01,479 --> 00:40:04,249
I feel the way
  to really benefit you

00:40:04,249 --> 00:40:06,751
would be for me to take over
  the manufacturing,

00:40:06,751 --> 00:40:08,520
to get you into
  bed bath &amp; beyond

00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,788
with the right packaging,

00:40:09,788 --> 00:40:12,557
and then to give you
  tv presence.

00:40:12,557 --> 00:40:16,494
So, Mark, I'd like to offer you
  to go in with me,

00:40:16,494 --> 00:40:19,764
but because I know how much
  work and effort

00:40:19,764 --> 00:40:21,232
it's going to take,

00:40:21,232 --> 00:40:24,402
because we're really starting
  from ground up,

00:40:24,402 --> 00:40:28,273
so I would want 50%
  of the company,

00:40:28,273 --> 00:40:36,314
and the same $30,000.

00:40:36,314 --> 00:40:38,216
I'm not gonna negotiate
  with them.

00:40:38,216 --> 00:40:41,086
No?
  It's just a good deal
  as it is.

00:40:41,086 --> 00:40:44,856
It's okay. But my offer
  would be 50/50

00:40:44,856 --> 00:40:46,925
for the $30,000.

00:40:46,925 --> 00:40:50,495
You've got an offer
  from Mark--$30,000 for 25%.

00:40:50,495 --> 00:40:53,298
Twice as much equity from Lori
  for $30,000,

00:40:53,298 --> 00:40:54,866
but she wants 50%.

00:40:56,901 --> 00:40:58,169
What are you gonna do?

00:40:59,337 --> 00:41:01,940
(Robert) Do you need
  to talk about it?

00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:04,075
I think we'd like to.
  I think--Yeah.

00:41:04,075 --> 00:41:05,143
Yes.

00:41:05,143 --> 00:41:06,177
Go ahead.

00:41:06,177 --> 00:41:09,147
Really smart little girls.

00:41:09,147 --> 00:41:10,849
Mark is being
  very generous...

00:41:10,849 --> 00:41:12,951
yes.
  But Lori is willing to go
  the extra yard...

00:41:12,951 --> 00:41:14,352
really.
  To put this out there.

00:41:14,352 --> 00:41:15,687
I think there is
  a lot of work here.

00:41:15,687 --> 00:41:17,155
I think there's
  a tremendous amount of work.

00:41:17,155 --> 00:41:18,757
I-I don't think...
  (Daymond) No, there's
  a lot of work.

00:41:18,757 --> 00:41:20,558
Lori's wrong
  in what she's doing.
  No, Lori's absolutely right.

00:41:23,094 --> 00:41:25,864
Let's summarize
  where we're at,

00:41:25,864 --> 00:41:27,665
'cause this is
  a reMarkable turnaround here.

00:41:27,665 --> 00:41:30,101
Got two offers.

00:41:30,101 --> 00:41:31,936
Mark is willing to give you

00:41:31,936 --> 00:41:34,339
$30,000 for 25%.

00:41:34,339 --> 00:41:37,175
Lori wants more because she
  feels she has to do more work--

00:41:37,175 --> 00:41:39,110
50% for the same amount
  of money.

00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:41,045

into stores and on, like,
  tv shows,

00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:25,890
and that just would really
  help us out.
