00:00:00,029 --> 00:00:02,004
Narrator:
This is the shark tank,

00:00:02,004 --> 00:00:03,015
where hopeful entrepreneurs

00:00:03,015 --> 00:00:06,001
get a once-in-a-lifetime chance
to pitch the sharks

00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:08,003
in hopes of getting
an investment

00:00:08,003 --> 00:00:11,013
to start, grow,
or save their businesses.

00:00:11,013 --> 00:00:13,028
We did $3.7 million
in sales last year.

00:00:13,028 --> 00:00:15,011
Wow.
Whoa.

00:00:15,011 --> 00:00:17,018
Narrator: The entrepreneurs
must convince a shark

00:00:17,018 --> 00:00:19,017
to invest the full amount
they're asking for,

00:00:19,017 --> 00:00:21,013
or they'll walk away
with nothing.

00:00:21,013 --> 00:00:23,011
When you walk
into the shark tank,

00:00:23,011 --> 00:00:24,018
you look for the sucker,

00:00:24,018 --> 00:00:27,011
and if you don't see one,
it's you.

00:00:27,011 --> 00:00:29,000
If the sharks
hear a great idea...
Oh!

00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,012
Wow.
...they're ready to invest
using their own money.

00:00:32,012 --> 00:00:35,011
I'm gonna spice it up here
in the shark tank a little bit.

00:00:35,011 --> 00:00:36,029
Narrator: And they're
willing to fight each other

00:00:36,029 --> 00:00:38,021
for a piece of the action.

00:00:38,021 --> 00:00:40,014
So, you're one
handshake away.

00:00:40,014 --> 00:00:42,022
So, let me stop you and make you
think about something.

00:00:42,022 --> 00:00:44,026
What Lori does well
is she sells product.

00:00:44,026 --> 00:00:47,029
What I do well
is I build power brands.

00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:51,007
Ooh. It's like a gunfight
at the O.K. Corral.

00:00:52,003 --> 00:00:53,007
Narrator:
Who are the sharks?

00:00:54,008 --> 00:00:58,013
They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors

00:00:58,013 --> 00:01:00,008
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.

00:01:00,008 --> 00:01:02,028
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist

00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:04,009
who turned a $10,000 loan

00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:08,029
into a software business
worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:14,003
Barbara Corcoran went from
waiting tables in Manhattan

00:01:14,003 --> 00:01:17,004
to building the city's
preeminent real-estate empire.

00:01:18,014 --> 00:01:21,021
Robert Herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,

00:01:21,021 --> 00:01:23,020
is now a technology mogul

00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:28,010
who sold his first Internet
companies for over $350 million.

00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:33,012
Lori Grenier, the queen of QVC,
holds over 100 patents

00:01:33,012 --> 00:01:35,018
and has launched
over 300 products

00:01:35,018 --> 00:01:39,012
grossing over a half a billion
dollars in retail sales.

00:01:39,012 --> 00:01:43,011
And Mark Cuban, notorious
billionaire entrepreneur,

00:01:43,011 --> 00:01:45,007
tech guru,
and the outspoken owner

00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:58,004
of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.

00:01:58,004 --> 00:02:01,567
First into the tank
is a couple from North Carolina

00:02:01,567 --> 00:02:04,557
with a company for fashionable
children everywhere.

00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:06,546
Aww.
Ohh.

00:02:06,546 --> 00:02:08,550
Corcoran:
Oh, look at them.

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,555
Oh, he's got
a little pocket thing, too.

00:02:09,555 --> 00:02:11,547
Love the outfit.

00:02:11,547 --> 00:02:14,544
Hi, sharks.
We are the Schaub family.

00:02:14,544 --> 00:02:15,567
I'm Amber.
I'm Mark.

00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:17,561
And this is
Aubrey and Jonas.

00:02:17,561 --> 00:02:19,564
And our company
is Rufflebutts,

00:02:19,564 --> 00:02:22,549
and we're offering
a 7% equity stake

00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:24,557
in exchange
for $600,000.

00:02:24,557 --> 00:02:25,571
[ Chuckles ]

00:02:25,571 --> 00:02:27,548
Yes, Rufflebutts.

00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:28,568
We put adorable ruffles

00:02:28,568 --> 00:02:31,557
on cute, little tushies
all over the world.

00:02:31,557 --> 00:02:33,548
[ Laughs ]
[ Laughs ]

00:02:33,548 --> 00:02:34,559
It was six years ago

00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:37,554
that I went out in search
for a baby gift.

00:02:37,554 --> 00:02:39,552
I was looking for those
little ruffled bloomers

00:02:39,552 --> 00:02:40,567
my mom always called
"Rufflebutts."

00:02:40,567 --> 00:02:43,544
It's when I realized they
were nowhere to be found

00:02:43,544 --> 00:02:44,553
that our company
was born.

00:02:44,553 --> 00:02:47,562
Our company started around
a simple baby bloomer,

00:02:47,562 --> 00:02:49,558
but we now design
and manufacture

00:02:49,558 --> 00:02:53,543
an entire clothing line
for girls up to age 6.

00:02:53,543 --> 00:02:55,564
And after too many
customer requests to ignore,

00:02:55,564 --> 00:02:59,549
we added a boy's line
named Ruggedbutts.

00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:02,554
Being super-cute
is top priority.

00:03:02,554 --> 00:03:04,555
Equally as important
is quality.
Thank you.

00:03:04,555 --> 00:03:05,556
And lastly,

00:03:05,556 --> 00:03:06,563
thank you.
Learning from
my frugal mom,

00:03:06,563 --> 00:03:08,552
affordable
to the masses.

00:03:08,552 --> 00:03:10,555
Thank you so much.

00:03:10,555 --> 00:03:12,546
Amber: And, mark,
this one is for Alyssa.

00:03:12,546 --> 00:03:13,563
Thanks, Amber.

00:03:13,563 --> 00:03:14,561
Cute.
Is that cute?

00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:15,571
Mark:
We are so proud

00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:18,545
of what Amber's little idea
has become.

00:03:18,545 --> 00:03:20,548
So, sharks, what do
you need to know

00:03:20,548 --> 00:03:23,546
to come join this ruffled
revolution with us?

00:03:25,545 --> 00:03:26,561
Okay, Jonas,
go with sissy.

00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:28,559
No!
There's skittles
down there.

00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:29,567
[ Laughs ]
You want to go home
with sissy?

00:03:29,567 --> 00:03:30,569
Aww.

00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:32,563
See, he didn't agree
with the valuation

00:03:32,563 --> 00:03:34,565
before it came out.
[ Laughs ]

00:03:34,565 --> 00:03:37,546
Amber, you have a big number
on this business.

00:03:37,546 --> 00:03:38,547
Tell us about your sales.

00:03:38,547 --> 00:03:39,561
Absolutely.

00:03:39,561 --> 00:03:42,557
We did $3.7 million
in sales last year.

00:03:42,557 --> 00:03:44,560
Awesome.

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,565
And we are on track to
do between $4.5 and
$5 million this year.

00:03:47,565 --> 00:03:50,562
Wow.
We started, we were
profitable in year one,

00:03:50,562 --> 00:03:52,546
and we have grown
every year since.

00:03:52,546 --> 00:03:54,542
We actually landed
on the inc. 500 list

00:03:54,542 --> 00:03:56,569
at number eight
in all of retail.

00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:00,554
This adorable little red outfit
with the ruffle bottom,

00:04:00,554 --> 00:04:02,545
what do you sell it for?

00:04:02,545 --> 00:04:03,554
They're right around
$25 apiece.

00:04:03,554 --> 00:04:04,571
Great value.

00:04:04,571 --> 00:04:06,565
Cuban: So, you probably have
debt right now.

00:04:06,565 --> 00:04:07,565
You probably have --

00:04:07,565 --> 00:04:08,563
no debt?

00:04:08,563 --> 00:04:09,562
Wow.

00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:12,268
Who owns the company?

00:04:12,268 --> 00:04:15,251
I own 51%
and Mark's at 49%.

00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:17,252
Oh, now we know who --
smart lady! Yeah!

00:04:17,252 --> 00:04:19,239
Now we know
who wears the ruffles.

00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:20,265
Herjavec: Wow, Mark,
I feel so bad for you.
He -- [ Laughs ]

00:04:20,265 --> 00:04:22,268
So, how many skus
do you have?

00:04:22,268 --> 00:04:25,242
So, I believe
it's about 700 skus...

00:04:25,242 --> 00:04:26,243
Whoa.

00:04:26,243 --> 00:04:27,257
Wow.
Whoa!
...in the ruffled bloomers.

00:04:27,257 --> 00:04:28,265
Between colors
and styles and sizes.

00:04:28,265 --> 00:04:29,266
You know where
I'm going with this.

00:04:29,266 --> 00:04:30,266
You don't need 700 skus.

00:04:30,266 --> 00:04:32,243
Just -- just to qualify,

00:04:32,243 --> 00:04:34,253
we actually have around
700 skus of bloomers.

00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:36,244
We've got
around 2,000 skus.

00:04:36,244 --> 00:04:38,242
Wow.
That's even more insane.

00:04:39,249 --> 00:04:41,367
Well, here's the thing,
I mean, as you guys know,

00:04:41,367 --> 00:04:44,386
with a fashion line, we have to
keep it fresh and hip.

00:04:44,386 --> 00:04:46,387
The amount of money
that you're asking for today

00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:48,377
is less than
you're gonna generate

00:04:48,377 --> 00:04:49,385
in terms of cash this year.

00:04:49,385 --> 00:04:51,370
Why do you need the money,

00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,366
and why the specific amount
of $600,000?

00:04:53,366 --> 00:04:56,379
Production, obviously
ramping up to build inventory.

00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,378
We absolutely, again, value
every one of the five of you

00:04:59,378 --> 00:05:01,391
as amazing strategic
partners.

00:05:01,391 --> 00:05:04,366
We want your expertise.
We want your advice.

00:05:04,366 --> 00:05:05,375
What you're saying is,
as you're growing

00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,383
and continuing to expand,
it's just nice

00:05:06,383 --> 00:05:07,391
to have someone
to bounce ideas off of.

00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,382
You're exactly right.

00:05:09,382 --> 00:05:11,380
Amber, tell us a little bit more
about yourself.

00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,382
I was in real estate,
and I found a lot of success,

00:05:14,382 --> 00:05:16,384
but there was
something missing.

00:05:16,384 --> 00:05:18,373
And I was really lacking
the fulfillment

00:05:18,373 --> 00:05:20,374
that I needed from my career,
and there was this --

00:05:20,374 --> 00:05:22,372
creating a product,
is that what was lacking there?

00:05:22,372 --> 00:05:25,374
It was really this...
Entrepreneurial bug,

00:05:25,374 --> 00:05:27,393
I guess I could say.

00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:29,383
Do you have competitors
out there

00:05:29,383 --> 00:05:32,369
that are making styles
like yours?

00:05:32,369 --> 00:05:35,367
Currently, we don't have
any one specific competitor

00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:37,900
that we would say,
"they do exactly what we do."

00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,891
2,700 skus
in a $5-million business --

00:05:42,891 --> 00:05:44,600
that is a massive
red flag to me.

00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:47,901
I-I experienced this
myself.

00:05:47,901 --> 00:05:49,911
My family started a business
called "Kiddies Togs,"

00:05:49,911 --> 00:05:52,887
winter clothing
for children.

00:05:52,887 --> 00:05:53,915
Exact same trajectory.

00:05:53,915 --> 00:05:58,901
What nearly killed us
is when we went past 200 skus.

00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:00,898
Let me tell you
a little story

00:06:00,898 --> 00:06:03,894
that comes from Greek mythology
I think you're gonna enjoy,

00:06:03,894 --> 00:06:06,886
'cause I'm seeing it
right in front of me.

00:06:06,886 --> 00:06:07,911
Zeus married a woman
named Demeter.

00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:10,900
They had a daughter
named Persephone.

00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,893
Everybody wanted to marry her,
including Hades.

00:06:14,893 --> 00:06:16,891
[ Chuckles ]
One day she was
picking flowers

00:06:16,891 --> 00:06:18,891
'cause she was always tempted
to go for more colors.

00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:21,906
The earth opened, she fell
into the bowels of hell.

00:06:21,906 --> 00:06:23,905
Oh, no!
Is there a point?

00:06:23,905 --> 00:06:24,915
Yeah, you're gonna
get to it in a second.

00:06:24,915 --> 00:06:27,886
You're gonna learn something,
too. Here we are in hell.

00:06:27,886 --> 00:06:29,886
Yes, we are in hell.
Persephone,
the most beautiful woman.

00:06:29,886 --> 00:06:30,914
Okay!
His home.

00:06:30,914 --> 00:06:33,890
And Hades knows that she's
constantly tempted for more.

00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,908
Even when she's blessed
with beauty, she wants more.

00:06:36,908 --> 00:06:38,906
I think what's happening here is
you're being tempted

00:06:38,906 --> 00:06:41,886
every day to expand more
and more and more.

00:06:41,886 --> 00:06:43,904
To me,
you are persephone.

00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:47,898
You have been tempted
by the devil of inventory,

00:06:47,898 --> 00:06:50,910
and having learned from Zeus,
I'm out.

00:06:56,895 --> 00:06:57,905
Cuban:
Guys, here's what I see.

00:06:57,905 --> 00:06:59,907
You're creating
this whole portfolio

00:06:59,907 --> 00:07:01,891
of products all the time.

00:07:01,891 --> 00:07:03,907
You have an idea, you see
a trend, you want to fill it.

00:07:03,907 --> 00:07:05,915
As you design new things,
you have to see what sticks.

00:07:05,915 --> 00:07:07,902
You have to see what works.
Right.

00:07:07,902 --> 00:07:10,899
Which gets to where
you have all those skus, right?

00:07:10,899 --> 00:07:12,908
But that takes
a lot of cash, right?

00:07:12,908 --> 00:07:15,907
'Cause you don't know
what your home runs are
until you try them.

00:07:15,907 --> 00:07:17,893
That's great for you.

00:07:17,893 --> 00:07:21,887
Bad for me because
the best bloomer in the world,

00:07:21,887 --> 00:07:22,903
I got no clue.

00:07:22,903 --> 00:07:24,915
And for that reason,
I have to say I'm out.

00:07:24,915 --> 00:07:27,887
Thank you.

00:07:27,887 --> 00:07:31,895
I think it is remarkable
you've gotten to this point

00:07:31,895 --> 00:07:32,897
without any debt.

00:07:32,897 --> 00:07:34,467
I couldn't have done that.

00:07:34,915 --> 00:07:38,900
I-I can't help you
on a daily basis.

00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,233
I wish I could.

00:07:40,233 --> 00:07:42,231
I know how
to grow businesses,

00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:44,248
but I don't understand
the fashion part,

00:07:44,248 --> 00:07:47,245
as Mark said,
or the other stuff.

00:07:47,245 --> 00:07:49,232
I'm out.

00:07:51,232 --> 00:07:53,238
Okay, we have
two sharkettes left.

00:07:57,249 --> 00:07:59,236
Why don't you start,
Barbara?

00:07:59,236 --> 00:08:01,258
No, because she's gonna
come in under me and outdo me.

00:08:01,258 --> 00:08:04,237
No way.
Well, then why don't you two
sharks get together?

00:08:04,237 --> 00:08:05,241
If you think
you're the better partner,

00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:06,248
what difference
would it make?

00:08:06,248 --> 00:08:09,235
Because it's always better
to go less, and you know it.

00:08:09,235 --> 00:08:10,239
Speak up, my friend.

00:08:11,247 --> 00:08:14,241
Ooh. It's like a gunfight
at the O.K. Corral.

00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:27,235
Narrator:
Three sharks are out.

00:08:27,235 --> 00:08:28,243
Barbara and Lori

00:08:28,243 --> 00:08:32,236
are Mark and Amber's last chance
to make a deal.

00:08:32,236 --> 00:08:34,237
Lori, what do you have
in your head?

00:08:34,237 --> 00:08:36,240
Greiner: You know, I really --
I seriously,

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,257
I was thinking, Barb.

00:08:37,257 --> 00:08:41,238
I, uh, I wasn't trying to go
first or last against you.

00:08:41,238 --> 00:08:42,253
Well, I was definitely
trying to go last.

00:08:42,253 --> 00:08:44,256
I really have been
thinking about this

00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:50,235
because they are asking
for $600,000 for 7%, so...

00:08:50,235 --> 00:08:52,235
You find that
a little light, perhaps?

00:08:52,235 --> 00:08:53,243
I find it
a little light.

00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:56,252
I'll put an offer
on the table.

00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:01,241
You rarely in business
get a super-creative

00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:03,237
who's really good
at business judgment.

00:09:03,237 --> 00:09:04,242
It rarely comes together,

00:09:04,242 --> 00:09:06,233
and you happen to have
both pieces of that.

00:09:06,233 --> 00:09:09,245
I'm gonna give you an offer
for $600,000 --

00:09:09,245 --> 00:09:12,237
$300,000 in cash,

00:09:12,237 --> 00:09:15,254
$300,000 in a
as-you-need-it-basis credit line

00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,242
for 12% of your business.

00:09:17,242 --> 00:09:19,230
First, let me tell you

00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,257
that we sincerely appreciate
your offer.

00:09:21,257 --> 00:09:23,249
We're so grateful
to be here,

00:09:23,249 --> 00:09:24,255
and we just are thrilled

00:09:24,255 --> 00:09:26,253
that you would want to
be a part in this with us.

00:09:26,253 --> 00:09:28,243
And you are one good
schmoozer, by the way.

00:09:28,243 --> 00:09:30,242
[ Laughter ]
Herjavec: Wow.

00:09:30,242 --> 00:09:33,249
So, with that,
that valuation

00:09:33,249 --> 00:09:35,230
puts our company

00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,245
close to what we're going to do
in revenue this year.

00:09:37,245 --> 00:09:39,242
I assume that is
a very sweet note.

00:09:39,242 --> 00:09:42,245
Well, listen.
[ Laughs ]
There's no assumption.

00:09:42,245 --> 00:09:47,235
The biggest challenge
is the equity and valuation.

00:09:47,235 --> 00:09:49,236
Those two kids that you saw
walk out of this room,

00:09:49,236 --> 00:09:50,243
all of this is for them,

00:09:50,243 --> 00:09:53,250
so every -- every ounce
of equity that we give up,

00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,256
that's theirs,
but we also understand

00:09:55,256 --> 00:09:58,239
the value that you bring
to this

00:09:58,239 --> 00:10:00,251
and what you can create for
them, which is why we're here.

00:10:00,251 --> 00:10:04,251
You two are very much
like my husband and myself.

00:10:04,251 --> 00:10:07,247
And I completely understand
both of you.

00:10:07,247 --> 00:10:10,237
I get you.
I have lived it for 17 years.

00:10:10,237 --> 00:10:12,242
So, here's my offer.

00:10:12,242 --> 00:10:19,244
I'm gonna give you
the $600,000 for 10%,

00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:23,257
but I'd like to get back
the first $300,000

00:10:23,257 --> 00:10:25,238
within the first year

00:10:25,238 --> 00:10:27,257
and the next in the second year.

00:10:27,257 --> 00:10:29,236
I want to clarify one thing.

00:10:29,236 --> 00:10:32,231
What Lori does well
is she sells product.

00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:35,247
What I do well
is I build power brands.

00:10:35,247 --> 00:10:38,240
And I've done it
with every business

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,248
I've invested in
on "shark tank."

00:10:39,248 --> 00:10:41,233
And by the way, as a --

00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:42,258
well, I've built
a $500-million power brand.

00:10:42,258 --> 00:10:44,238
Yes, of course.
So, I don't think...

00:10:44,238 --> 00:10:46,246
Lori, may I finish, please?
...that what she's saying

00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:48,241
is really necessary.
No, no. I'm not --
I'm not knocking it.

00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:50,231
Are you staying at your offer,
or are you changing it?

00:10:50,231 --> 00:10:51,245
No, no. They can respond
to the offer,

00:10:51,245 --> 00:10:52,244
all right?
Okay.

00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,235
The offers are very close
to each other.

00:10:56,235 --> 00:10:57,240
Who do you want to
work with?

00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,258
Lori's is just a loan.

00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:01,233
May I mention to you
the $300,000

00:11:01,233 --> 00:11:03,234
is a one-year loan
for equity.
It's more than a loan.

00:11:03,234 --> 00:11:04,257
It's a lifetime
of experience.

00:11:04,257 --> 00:11:06,255
But do you understand
the offers?

00:11:06,255 --> 00:11:10,252
And I'll just say that
my experience is in retail.

00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:14,240
Barbara's is in real estate
with some "shark tank" deals.

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,256
Some "shark --"
okay, stop.
Both of you, stop.

00:11:15,256 --> 00:11:17,242
17 years
of experience.
Do you ha--

00:11:17,242 --> 00:11:18,255
do you need
any more information?

00:11:18,255 --> 00:11:21,237
We honestly would be
beyond honored

00:11:21,237 --> 00:11:23,243
to work with
either one of you.

00:11:23,243 --> 00:11:26,229
I mean, obviously to me, you are
both inspirational women,

00:11:26,229 --> 00:11:27,234
so it is definitely
something

00:11:27,234 --> 00:11:28,248
we need to talk about
and process.

00:11:28,248 --> 00:11:30,246
I appreciate it.
Amber, this is business.
Go make a decision.

00:11:30,246 --> 00:11:32,233
Got it.
Okay.

00:11:35,231 --> 00:11:36,242
Wow.

00:11:36,242 --> 00:11:37,256
That's interesting.

00:11:37,256 --> 00:11:40,255
Does that affect the long-term
value of our company?

00:11:40,255 --> 00:11:43,239
Yeah. I mean, it's --
the main reason here

00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:46,236
is the strategic partnership
with either one of them.
Possibly.

00:11:46,236 --> 00:11:48,238
Lori, that's the worst deal
you've ever offered to somebody.

00:11:48,238 --> 00:11:49,245
Mark!
In fact --

00:11:49,245 --> 00:11:51,235
I'm just telling you.
I'm just telling you the facts.

00:11:51,235 --> 00:11:53,237
That's a Kevin deal.
O'Leary: No, it isn't!

00:11:53,237 --> 00:11:55,242
It's a very smart,
financially astute deal.

00:11:55,242 --> 00:11:56,248
For her,
not for them.
Oh, that --

00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:57,256
that's right.
That is a Kevin deal.

00:11:57,256 --> 00:11:59,251
It is a Kevin deal.

00:12:01,257 --> 00:12:04,230
Let's summarize
what we've got here.

00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,252
So, Barbara's offer
was the $600,000 for 12%.

00:12:06,252 --> 00:12:10,241
However, $300,000 of that
is actually a loan

00:12:10,241 --> 00:12:12,241
you have to pay back.

00:12:12,241 --> 00:12:16,232
Lori's offer --
10% equity for the $600,000,

00:12:16,232 --> 00:12:19,239
but she wants her money back
in 24 months.

00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,258
What are you going to do?

00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,229
We absolutely see the value
in strategic partnership

00:12:29,229 --> 00:12:31,245
with working
with either one of you.

00:12:31,245 --> 00:12:33,236
What our counter
would be --

00:12:33,236 --> 00:12:36,258
the same $600,000
in exchange for 8% equity.

00:12:42,242 --> 00:12:44,233
Would you compromise
at 10%?

00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:47,241
If I met you halfway,
would you go the other half?

00:12:47,241 --> 00:12:50,257
Barbara, I-I want to with
everything I have standing here,

00:12:50,257 --> 00:12:52,238
but I-I-I just can't.

00:12:53,252 --> 00:12:57,229
For me,
I feel 10% is right.

00:12:58,243 --> 00:13:01,240
Lori, can I ask you,
is that the highest valuation

00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,236
that you're willing
to put on the company?

00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,258
I'll go 9%, that's it.

00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,252
So, I think
at this point,

00:13:11,252 --> 00:13:14,252
you really have to decide, what
do you feel is right for you?

00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,252
What do you feel in your gut
is best?

00:13:20,256 --> 00:13:23,235
All right, Lori.
You have a deal.

00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:25,239
Yay!
Wow. Whoo.

00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:27,239
Thank you!
I'm very excited.

00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:28,239
Herjavec: Nice job, mark.

00:13:28,239 --> 00:13:30,238
You're a very talented
couple.

00:13:30,238 --> 00:13:32,253
Thanks, guys.
Thank you.
Thank you, guys.

00:13:32,253 --> 00:13:35,237
I can't believe
she took that.
Horrible deal.

00:13:35,237 --> 00:13:36,258
When they wake up,
they'll realize they messed up.

00:13:36,258 --> 00:13:38,235
No, no.
She made a very smart deal,

00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:39,244
given the risk
that this company has.

00:13:39,244 --> 00:13:41,231
Both: No, Lori did
a great deal.

00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:42,238
I think it's terrific.

00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,241
I don't think
they got it.

00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:45,232
Oh, you guys.

00:13:45,232 --> 00:13:46,237
Do you believe
we did this?

00:13:46,237 --> 00:13:48,242
Amber: In the end, it was
a really tough decision.

00:13:48,242 --> 00:13:51,247
Every percent of equity
is coming from our family.

00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:55,246
When Lori showed that she was
willing to compromise with us,

00:13:55,246 --> 00:13:57,232
that she came to the 9%,

00:13:57,232 --> 00:13:58,251
we knew that she was
the right partner

00:13:58,251 --> 00:13:59,256
for our business.

00:14:04,258 --> 00:14:07,249
Narrator: In season three,
the four Mastronardo brothers

00:14:07,249 --> 00:14:09,234
made a deal with Barbara

00:14:09,234 --> 00:14:12,234
for their line of skin-care
products, Nardo's Natural.

00:14:12,234 --> 00:14:13,240
We welcome you
to the family.

00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,243
Wow, great!
Come on down here!

00:14:14,243 --> 00:14:15,258
All right, thank you.
You won't regret it.

00:14:15,258 --> 00:14:18,238
Narrator: Let's see
how they're doing now.

00:14:18,238 --> 00:14:21,250
Danny:
We've had an incredible year,
and it's been a roller coaster,

00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,252
but things have
also been bittersweet.

00:14:23,252 --> 00:14:25,239
When we came
on "shark tank,"

00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,248
we were four brothers
with a family business.

00:14:27,248 --> 00:14:29,240
Show them the face.
Please?

00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,232
[ Laughter ]

00:14:31,232 --> 00:14:33,230
Danny: Unfortunately,
earlier in the year,

00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,238
we lost our baby brother K.J.
In a tragic accident.

00:14:37,234 --> 00:14:38,250
It's been a tough time for us,

00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,239
but we've stood together
and stayed strong.

00:14:41,239 --> 00:14:44,245
D.J.:
Our recent tragedy has only
strengthened our family bond.

00:14:44,245 --> 00:14:46,240
Now we're motivated
more than ever

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,230
to make our business
a success

00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,250
'cause that's what K.J.
would have wanted.

00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:53,249
Corcoran: Hey, guys.

00:14:53,249 --> 00:14:55,233
All: Hey, Barbara.

00:14:55,233 --> 00:14:57,257
Since partnering with Barbara,
our business has exploded,

00:14:57,257 --> 00:15:00,234
and to date, we have
over $500,000 in sales.

00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:02,235
I can't believe
 the sales figures.

00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:05,231
$500,000?!
 Did you make that up?

00:15:05,231 --> 00:15:06,244
Barbara's
been a guiding light,

00:15:06,244 --> 00:15:08,230
and she took a leap of faith
with us.

00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,236
I'm so proud of you.

00:15:09,236 --> 00:15:10,255
And now with the growth
of our company,

00:15:10,255 --> 00:15:12,257
we're talking to big-box
retailers like Whole Foods,

00:15:12,257 --> 00:15:14,245
Walgreen's, and CVS.

00:15:14,245 --> 00:15:16,253
Thank you for calling
Nardo's Natural.
How may I help you?

00:15:16,253 --> 00:15:18,247
Before "shark tank,"
it was my brothers and I

00:15:18,247 --> 00:15:20,229
making products
in the kitchen.

00:15:20,229 --> 00:15:21,251
Let's start off right
and hit this month's quota,

00:15:21,251 --> 00:15:23,246
and let's get some noise.
Come on.

00:15:23,246 --> 00:15:26,235
Danny: And now we've created
jobs and have 14 sales reps...

00:15:26,235 --> 00:15:27,251
It's looking good.

00:15:27,251 --> 00:15:30,243
...and we have a full
manufacturing facility
and fulfillment center,

00:15:30,243 --> 00:15:32,250
and it's great to see our
products going down the line.

00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,243
Thanks to "shark tank,"
we're on our way

00:15:34,243 --> 00:15:36,233
to becoming
a million-dollar company.

00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:37,245
Good job.

00:15:37,245 --> 00:15:40,242
A large piece of our family
and business has been lost,

00:15:40,242 --> 00:15:42,234
but it's made us bond
as brothers,

00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:44,233
and we're doing our best
to remain positive

00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:46,232
to continue pursuing
the American dream.

00:15:58,256 --> 00:16:01,066
Narrator: Next up
is a doctor with a product

00:16:01,066 --> 00:16:04,081
inspired by her goal
to relieve pain and suffering.

00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,084
Hello, sharks.

00:16:14,084 --> 00:16:15,089
I'm Dr. Edna Ma,

00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:18,070
a board-certified
anesthesiologist

00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,091
and the creator of Bareease.

00:16:19,091 --> 00:16:22,071
I'm seeking $50,000

00:16:22,071 --> 00:16:26,084
in exchange for 20% equity
of my growing company.

00:16:26,084 --> 00:16:28,067
As an anesthesiologist,

00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:30,078
my life is all about pain
prevention and pain management.

00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:32,079
So it was only natural
for me

00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,066
to create a product
that would ease people's pain.

00:16:35,066 --> 00:16:37,068
Allow me to introduce
Bareease.

00:16:42,063 --> 00:16:43,070
[ Laughs ]

00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,085
I wonder what it is.

00:16:44,085 --> 00:16:46,089
Dr. Ma: Bareease
is a patented numbing kit

00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:48,071
used before waxing or laser

00:16:48,071 --> 00:16:50,091
so grooming the bikini line
doesn't have to be painful.

00:16:50,091 --> 00:16:53,069
How does Bareease work?

00:16:53,069 --> 00:16:55,081
The user wears the kit
before her appointment,

00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:57,087
allowing time
to numb the skin.

00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:00,085
Then immediately before her
service, she removes the kit,

00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:03,070
and her skin will be ready
for ouchless hair removal.

00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:06,080
And that could mean waxing,
laser, or even electrolysis.

00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,076
Our proprietary formula
has been granted a patent

00:17:09,076 --> 00:17:11,076
for its unique ability
to not just numb,

00:17:11,076 --> 00:17:13,074
but to soothe
and moisturize the skin.

00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:17,071
Now it is my goal to convince
at least one of you sharks

00:17:17,071 --> 00:17:18,091
to grant me the privilege
of working with you

00:17:18,091 --> 00:17:21,078
so we can grow Bareease
and show more women

00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:23,083
that their grooming regimen
doesn't have to hurt.

00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,070
I'm gonna hand out
some samples now

00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:27,072
so you can try it in the privacy
of your own home.

00:17:27,072 --> 00:17:30,077
[ Laughter ]

00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:33,066
Cuban: And this is
over the counter, right?

00:17:33,066 --> 00:17:34,077
Thank you, Edna.

00:17:34,077 --> 00:17:36,090
Dr. ma: Uh, yes. 4% Lidocaine
is the maximum strength

00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:39,077
you can sell over the counter
without a prescription

00:17:39,077 --> 00:17:40,086
in the United States.

00:17:40,086 --> 00:17:42,073
Doctor, at any one time,
how many women

00:17:42,073 --> 00:17:43,082
are about to get
blasted?

00:17:43,082 --> 00:17:46,064
[ Laughs ]
I'm glad you asked
that question.

00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:49,083
We worked with the
world-renowned Kinsey Institute

00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,092
at Indiana university...
Indiana university.

00:17:50,092 --> 00:17:52,081
...to quantify this market

00:17:52,081 --> 00:17:54,084
and this potential
opportunity.

00:17:54,084 --> 00:17:56,075
And according to
their research,

00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,070
between 40%
and upwards of 80% of women

00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,091
are grooming the bikini line,
and that includes all methods.

00:18:01,091 --> 00:18:04,065
That seems remarkable
to me.
Yes.

00:18:04,065 --> 00:18:05,067
Grooming the bikini line

00:18:05,067 --> 00:18:07,063
is now considered
the new "cultural norm."

00:18:07,063 --> 00:18:09,068
Overall --
and let me just say,
men are thankful.

00:18:09,068 --> 00:18:10,073
[ Laughs ]

00:18:10,073 --> 00:18:11,079
Men are doing this, too.

00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:12,082
What?

00:18:12,082 --> 00:18:14,074
Yes, manscaping.
Haven't you heard of it?

00:18:14,074 --> 00:18:15,079
Yeah, that's true.

00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:17,086
What happens to the package
if a man tries this?

00:18:17,086 --> 00:18:19,090
Permanent numbing.
[ Laughs ]

00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,088
This is
the men's version.

00:18:21,088 --> 00:18:23,081
O'Leary: Doctor, are you --
are you serious?

00:18:23,081 --> 00:18:26,087
This is dead serious.
We created a men's version, too.

00:18:26,087 --> 00:18:28,081
It's called "numb"...

00:18:28,081 --> 00:18:29,085
Fill in the blank.
Okay.

00:18:29,085 --> 00:18:30,085
Numb cashews.

00:18:30,085 --> 00:18:32,085
How do you apply that?
[ Laughs ]

00:18:32,085 --> 00:18:34,071
How did you come up
with the idea?

00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,068
A few years ago,
I got my first Brazilian wax,

00:18:36,068 --> 00:18:37,081
and it was so painful.

00:18:37,081 --> 00:18:40,075
As a physician that specializes
in pain prevention,

00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:42,067
I knew that there
was a simple solution

00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:43,069
to this painful problem.

00:18:43,069 --> 00:18:44,092
So, you put the cream
on this?

00:18:44,092 --> 00:18:47,066
You put the cream
on the targeted area,

00:18:47,066 --> 00:18:48,081
then slip into the panty.

00:18:48,081 --> 00:18:50,068
And the panty
helps isolate the cream

00:18:50,068 --> 00:18:51,083
oh, I see.
And prevents
the transfer of the cream

00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,066
onto your clothes.

00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:54,087
There are numbing creams
on the market,

00:18:54,087 --> 00:18:57,070
primarily for, like, canker
sores and for hemorrhoids,

00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:01,077
but mine is specifically
targeting the bikini area.

00:19:01,077 --> 00:19:02,081
So, it's more of
a branding issue

00:19:02,081 --> 00:19:04,063
than it is anything else,
right?
Yes.

00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,092
And then my product can be sold
over the counter.
Right.

00:19:05,092 --> 00:19:07,080
Edna, how long have you
been selling it?

00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,073
We've been selling
for about three years.

00:19:09,073 --> 00:19:10,086
Together:
What are your sales?

00:19:10,086 --> 00:19:14,068
Last year we sold
$45,000 worth of products,

00:19:14,068 --> 00:19:17,064
and that's enough for us
to demonstrate proof of concept

00:19:17,064 --> 00:19:18,076
in this new category
before --

00:19:18,076 --> 00:19:19,085
and how about this year?

00:19:19,085 --> 00:19:21,076
This year we're projected

00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,084
to have $62,000
worth of sales.

00:19:23,084 --> 00:19:25,075
$45,000 isn't a lot.

00:19:25,075 --> 00:19:27,075
What do you think
has held you back?

00:19:27,075 --> 00:19:29,075
For me, I think
it's distribution.

00:19:29,075 --> 00:19:32,069
The majority of our sales
are online.

00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:33,078
Edna, what do you
sell it for?

00:19:33,078 --> 00:19:35,081
It sells for $18 retail

00:19:35,081 --> 00:19:36,086
for the kit.
Wholesale?

00:19:36,086 --> 00:19:38,066
Corcoran:
But it's a single-use...
And what --

00:19:38,066 --> 00:19:39,073
what does it cost you
to make it?
...right?

00:19:39,073 --> 00:19:41,073
It costs me $2.82.

00:19:41,073 --> 00:19:43,065
How do you j--
divvy up your time

00:19:43,065 --> 00:19:45,075
between your work as a doctor
and your business?

00:19:45,075 --> 00:19:47,067
[ Sighs ]
That's a hard question.

00:19:47,067 --> 00:19:48,074
I do practice medicine still.

00:19:48,074 --> 00:19:49,092
I practice
in the academic setting,

00:19:49,092 --> 00:19:52,070
teaching residents
and medical students,

00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:54,091
and I have a job
in the private practice,

00:19:54,091 --> 00:19:56,087
and then I have my family
and my little boy.

00:19:56,087 --> 00:19:58,086
That's a lot.

00:19:58,086 --> 00:20:02,067
I think the concern I've got is
I look at three years of effort,

00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:04,087
and, you know, $40,000,
$50,000 in sales

00:20:04,087 --> 00:20:06,084
in a market,
by your own definition,

00:20:06,084 --> 00:20:09,073
that should be in the millions,
we're just not there.

00:20:09,073 --> 00:20:11,075
And I think one
of the reasons

00:20:11,075 --> 00:20:14,086
is that you just don't have
a full-time focus on this.

00:20:14,086 --> 00:20:16,071
It's not
a company yet.

00:20:16,071 --> 00:20:18,068
And it hasn't been
enough for you to say,

00:20:18,068 --> 00:20:20,090
"okay, I have so much confidence
in this product,

00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:24,085
I'm willing to leave everything
behind and focus on this."

00:20:24,085 --> 00:20:27,082
You're absolutely right.
I wouldn't disagree with you.

00:20:27,082 --> 00:20:30,070
This is a product
in just a baby infant company.

00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:33,000
But I don't want to
just buy a product

00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,981
and then have it be called
"Dr. Mark's Bareease,"

00:20:36,981 --> 00:20:38,005
right?
No?

00:20:38,005 --> 00:20:39,991
So, for that reason,
I'm out.

00:20:39,991 --> 00:20:43,000
Thank you.
I appreciate your time
in listening to me.

00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,996
Edna, I think you
could certainly make
a business of this,

00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:48,988
but to use your own analogy,
like a baby company,

00:20:48,988 --> 00:20:51,994
and just like a baby,
it needs 150% of your attention.

00:20:51,994 --> 00:20:55,976
And by you standing here
looking for a partner,

00:20:55,976 --> 00:20:57,001
what I'm really hearing
between the lines

00:20:57,001 --> 00:20:59,984
is you're looking for someone
to drive this business home.

00:20:59,984 --> 00:21:01,992
And that's really
the job of the entrepreneur.

00:21:01,992 --> 00:21:03,999
I would never ask one of you
to take over this product

00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:06,979
because it requires such
a tremendous amount of time.

00:21:06,979 --> 00:21:08,998
I know that.
But time you don't
have to really give.

00:21:08,998 --> 00:21:10,994
Right. And so,
what I am looking for

00:21:10,994 --> 00:21:14,993
is somebody
who has the experience

00:21:14,993 --> 00:21:16,980
of taking a product like mine

00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,996
and licensing it. Yeah.
And just getting
a license.

00:21:17,996 --> 00:21:19,005
That's really what
you're after.
Exactly.

00:21:19,005 --> 00:21:20,986
Yeah.
Exactly.
A licensing opportunity.

00:21:20,986 --> 00:21:22,977
I'm not the girl for you.
I'm out.

00:21:22,977 --> 00:21:25,985
Thank you for your time
and feedback.

00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:27,998
O'Leary: I'm not sure
about the market size.

00:21:27,998 --> 00:21:31,991
I think there's
a lot of competition

00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:35,976
for how you desensitize
the area,

00:21:35,976 --> 00:21:37,990
but I think what I've seen
from the sales

00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:40,993
is that it really hasn't grown
as fast I would have liked.

00:21:40,993 --> 00:21:42,989
And for that reason,
I'm out.

00:21:42,989 --> 00:21:46,003
Thank you, Mr. wonderful,
for your time and feedback.

00:21:46,003 --> 00:21:47,980
Thank you.

00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,004
I can tell you about --

00:21:49,004 --> 00:21:51,005
my journey
is very similar to yours.

00:21:51,005 --> 00:21:54,977
My parents,
they escaped communist China

00:21:54,977 --> 00:21:55,985
to come
to the United States

00:21:55,985 --> 00:21:57,005
for a better opportunity
for their kids.

00:21:57,005 --> 00:22:00,991
And they worked in restaurants
all their life.

00:22:00,991 --> 00:22:03,001
And they came over
not speaking any English.

00:22:03,001 --> 00:22:05,004
And we worked in the restaurants
growing up.

00:22:05,004 --> 00:22:08,978
And I know the definition
of a strong work ethic.

00:22:08,978 --> 00:22:09,989
I'm not afraid of that.

00:22:09,989 --> 00:22:12,980
I'm the first person in
my family to graduate college.

00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,995
I think through me
and my sisters,

00:22:14,995 --> 00:22:16,987
who also have doctorates,

00:22:16,987 --> 00:22:18,999
we're living
their American dream.

00:22:21,995 --> 00:22:24,987
You know, to me...
Mm-hmm.

00:22:24,987 --> 00:22:26,997
I'm very impressed
by you

00:22:26,997 --> 00:22:28,977
and your journey.
Thank you.

00:22:28,977 --> 00:22:30,987
You have a long way
to go.

00:22:30,987 --> 00:22:33,000
And also, there are
other things out there.

00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,983
But I commend you
for what you've done.

00:22:35,983 --> 00:22:36,991
Thank you.

00:22:36,991 --> 00:22:39,003
And if I ever needed an
anesthesiologist, I'd want you.

00:22:39,003 --> 00:22:41,003

I would -- I-I --

00:22:41,003 --> 00:22:42,983
but I am going to be out.

yes, sir.

00:22:49,002 --> 00:22:51,979
I think
it's an admirable start,

00:22:51,979 --> 00:22:53,979
and thank you
for sharing your story with us.

00:22:53,979 --> 00:22:55,001
You know, my dad
escaped from a jail,

00:22:55,001 --> 00:22:57,996
brought us here on a boat,
just like your parents.

00:22:57,996 --> 00:23:02,979
You can never underestimate
the work ethic

00:23:02,979 --> 00:23:04,002
of somebody that comes
to this country

00:23:04,002 --> 00:23:06,982
and appreciates what they have
every day.

00:23:06,982 --> 00:23:08,977
Absolutely.

00:23:08,977 --> 00:23:10,998
When I started my business,
here was the challenge --

00:23:10,998 --> 00:23:12,004
I had a good job.

00:23:12,004 --> 00:23:14,989
I didn't want to take the risk
of starting a company.

00:23:14,989 --> 00:23:16,983
So, I kind of wanted
to start a company,

00:23:16,983 --> 00:23:18,002
but I didn't want to
leave comfort.

00:23:18,002 --> 00:23:21,998
I got fired, and I needed to
start a company

00:23:21,998 --> 00:23:24,986
to make the next
mortgage payment.

00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:28,999
So, I think it's hard
to leave comfort

00:23:28,999 --> 00:23:31,982
until you have
some real pain.

00:23:31,982 --> 00:23:34,986
Are you really gonna
leave the comforts

00:23:34,986 --> 00:23:37,977
of doing what you're doing
and all that success

00:23:37,977 --> 00:23:38,988
in order
to run this company?

00:23:38,988 --> 00:23:41,989
My day job pays the bills.

00:23:41,989 --> 00:23:44,002
It's a hobby.
It's not a business.

and time.

I-I think my only point to her
was, at the end of the day,

00:24:02,999 --> 00:24:05,001
entrepreneurism
has a risk,

00:24:05,001 --> 00:24:07,989

isn't worth taking.

Rent a Goat is the answer

00:24:49,357 --> 00:24:52,377
to a landscape disaster like
this -- an overgrown mess.

00:24:52,377 --> 00:24:54,371
Now, usually
conventional landscapers

00:24:54,371 --> 00:24:57,354
use pesticides, machinery,

00:24:57,354 --> 00:24:58,367
or manual labor
to clean this mess up,

00:24:58,367 --> 00:25:01,350

probably don't know

00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,375
there is an amazing

I mean, you wake up and say,
"I want goats." I mean, why?

00:25:46,377 --> 00:25:48,379
I graduated college
in 2009.

00:25:48,379 --> 00:25:50,361
And you thought "goat."

00:25:50,361 --> 00:25:52,361
I thought goats, so, I went
to the Republic of Moldova.

00:25:52,361 --> 00:25:53,366
Have you guys
heard of that?

00:25:53,366 --> 00:25:54,370
Yes.
It's in eastern Europe.

00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:56,354
And I saw they had
these little goats

00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:57,361
on a little stake
with a rope,

00:25:57,361 --> 00:25:58,377
and they would clear
these circles of land,

00:25:58,377 --> 00:26:00,376
they move them to a different
spot, and before you know it,

00:26:00,376 --> 00:26:02,370
you had these crop circles
in this big open field.

00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:05,362
So, it wasn't
the new technology,

00:26:05,362 --> 00:26:08,356
the expensive weed eaters
that cleared this land for them.

00:26:08,356 --> 00:26:09,361
It was goats.

00:26:09,361 --> 00:26:11,362
So, I started a website
called Rent a Goat

00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:13,373
that connected goat wranglers
with customers.

00:26:13,373 --> 00:26:15,351
I teamed up with Mike,

00:26:15,351 --> 00:26:16,372
who's been on the website
for over three years.

00:26:16,372 --> 00:26:19,376

over $600,000 a year.

Before he hooked up to you.
Yeah.

00:26:24,353 --> 00:26:27,357
I'd like to understand how
this works a little bit better.

00:26:27,357 --> 00:26:29,357
450 goats eat an acre a day.

00:26:29,357 --> 00:26:31,433
An acre a day.
How much
does it cost somebody

00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:35,567
to bring in 450 goats a day,
and who are those customers?

00:26:35,567 --> 00:26:37,564
So, I analyzed
Mike's business,

00:26:37,564 --> 00:26:38,580
and 70% of his customers

00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,582
are homeowners associations
and municipalities.

00:26:40,582 --> 00:26:42,575
We do
a homeowners association

00:26:42,575 --> 00:26:44,564
right now
in Southern California,

00:26:44,564 --> 00:26:47,579
and they had
about 130 acres.

00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:49,593
It cost them $70,000.

00:26:49,593 --> 00:26:52,571
And that's cheaper than having
a mechanical machine cut it?

00:26:52,571 --> 00:26:53,585

with a person
with a weed eater like that,

it costs them
about $2,700 an acre.

How much
do you charge, Mike?

00:27:02,593 --> 00:27:06,667
From $400 an acre
to $1,200 an acre.

our fifth year
we're gonna grow $600,000,

00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,794
and it's an average
R.O.I. of 45%.

00:27:23,794 --> 00:27:25,784
What are you gonna do
in your fir--

00:27:25,784 --> 00:27:26,533
okay,
now you're talking --
first year is $200,000.

Projections are nice.

00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,767
Projections
are guesses, right?

00:27:28,767 --> 00:27:30,333
It's not a guess if we have
a model to base it on.

00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:32,334

necessary to make it happen,

right now.
What are you gonna do
your first year?

00:27:36,338 --> 00:27:38,329
First year -- $200,000.
That's conservative,

00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:39,350
based on $1,000 per day
at 450 goats.

00:29:37,472 --> 00:29:39,491
[ Laughter ]

00:29:39,491 --> 00:29:41,480
I'd be the goat shark.

00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,488
The goat shark --
I like that.

00:29:43,488 --> 00:29:46,486
Matt, I admire
the -- the idea,

00:29:46,486 --> 00:29:50,487
but the business plan is
a little bit all over the map.

00:29:51,492 --> 00:29:52,492
I'm out.

00:29:55,488 --> 00:29:57,491
I'm not gonna ride your herd
into the sunset with you.

00:29:57,491 --> 00:29:59,495
I don't think this business
is proprietary at all.

00:29:59,495 --> 00:30:02,478
And I think if it makes as much
money as you predict it will...

00:30:02,478 --> 00:30:04,479
It will.
...you're gonna have
a ton of competition.

00:30:04,479 --> 00:30:06,482
And moving the goats around,
there's so much complexity

00:30:06,482 --> 00:30:07,495
in the logistics
of this business.

00:30:07,495 --> 00:30:09,494
That's why a lot
of people can't do it.

00:30:09,494 --> 00:30:11,473
That's why it doesn't work.

00:30:11,473 --> 00:30:12,473
Yeah, but I'm out.

00:30:14,485 --> 00:30:15,492
Thanks, guys.
Greiner: Good luck.

00:30:15,492 --> 00:30:17,477
Cuban: Good luck, guys.
Thank you so much.

00:30:17,477 --> 00:30:18,488
Bye, goats.

00:30:18,488 --> 00:30:20,480
Thank you.
See you, guys.
Corcoran: Bye-bye.

00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,496
Greiner: Bye, goats.
That Mike is so cool,
isn't he?

00:30:21,496 --> 00:30:22,500
Herjavec: I love Mike.
Yeah.

00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,481
I think
he's a classic rancher.

00:30:24,481 --> 00:30:25,497
I liked Mike.
I didn't know about Matt's plan.

00:30:25,497 --> 00:30:27,477
He was a little bit, uh --

00:30:27,477 --> 00:30:29,500
I don't know what Matt brings
to the table, frankly.

00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,482
We didn't quite
get the business model.

00:30:32,482 --> 00:30:35,480
You know, we went too far
afield with the website,

00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,472
which in the beginning
we knew was a minefield.

00:30:38,472 --> 00:30:39,475
Yeah.

00:30:39,475 --> 00:30:40,495
And that's where
they went with it.

00:30:46,493 --> 00:30:49,482
My name is Teresa fraijo.
This is my husband Robert.

00:30:49,482 --> 00:30:51,488
We live in Laguna Niguel,
California,

00:30:51,488 --> 00:30:54,483
with our two sons,
Vance and Maximillian.

00:30:54,483 --> 00:30:56,495
And we are the creators
of Veggie Mama.

00:30:56,495 --> 00:30:58,476
Broccoli --
why don't you try that?

00:30:58,476 --> 00:30:59,488
No, I don't like that.
Come on!

00:30:59,488 --> 00:31:02,472
Getting our children
to eat healthy has
always been a battle.

00:31:02,472 --> 00:31:03,495
Eat it! It's yummmy.
Blech!

00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:05,500
So, we had to get
a little bit more creative.

00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:11,486
After experimenting
in the kitchen

00:31:11,486 --> 00:31:13,490
with yummy smoothies
for our children...

00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,481
Cheers!

00:31:15,481 --> 00:31:17,500
...I had my "aha!" moment
and Veggie Mama was created.

00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,486
What do you think
about this new box design?
I think
we should run with it.

00:31:20,486 --> 00:31:21,499
Robert:
We pretty much put it

00:31:21,499 --> 00:31:23,478
all on the line
for Veggie Mama.

00:31:23,478 --> 00:31:25,500
I dropped out of law school.
We moved in with my parents.

00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,487
Teresa: We've spent
every dime of our savings.

00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:30,495
We've borrowed money
from family and friends.

00:31:30,495 --> 00:31:33,489
And we even sold the diamond
out of my wedding ring,

00:31:33,489 --> 00:31:35,473
so we have a lot
riding on this.

00:31:35,473 --> 00:31:35,828
Ready?

00:31:35,828 --> 00:31:37,473
Go get it!

00:31:37,473 --> 00:31:39,482
My family
is so important to me.

00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:40,486
They have been...

00:31:40,486 --> 00:31:43,479
[ Voice breaking ]
They've been a huge, huge,

00:31:43,479 --> 00:31:46,481
um, inspiration and help to us
to get this going,

00:31:46,481 --> 00:31:49,499
and we couldn't have done it
without all of their help.

00:32:08,498 --> 00:32:10,472
Hello, sharks.

00:32:10,472 --> 00:32:13,489
My name is Teresa,
A.K.A. Veggie Mama.

00:32:13,489 --> 00:32:16,498
And this is my husband,
Robert -- Veggie Papa.

00:32:16,498 --> 00:32:19,487
We are the co-founders
of Veggie Mama

00:32:19,487 --> 00:32:21,501
and are here today
seeking $75,000

00:32:21,501 --> 00:32:24,496
in exchange
for 15% of our company.

00:32:24,496 --> 00:32:29,477
Any parent knows it is not
always easy to get children --

00:32:29,477 --> 00:32:31,472
or husbands --
to eat their vegetables,

00:32:31,472 --> 00:32:33,491
but we have solved
that problem.

00:32:33,491 --> 00:32:36,496
Veggie Mama has created
a delicious way

00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:39,474
to sneak in those
essential nutrients.

00:32:39,474 --> 00:32:40,487
When it comes
to snack time,

00:32:40,487 --> 00:32:42,501
picky kids want
something fun and tasty --

00:32:42,501 --> 00:32:45,496
spinach and beets -- probably
not gonna top their list.

00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:47,501
So we took
the classic frozen pop

00:32:47,501 --> 00:32:50,482
and snuck in real fruits
and real vegetables.

00:32:50,482 --> 00:32:53,484
Veggie Mama garden pops
are frozen snacks

00:32:53,484 --> 00:32:56,476
made with real fruits
and vegetables

00:32:56,476 --> 00:32:59,481
and sweetened only
with organic agave nectar.

00:32:59,481 --> 00:33:02,499
No artificial colors,
flavors, or preservatives.

00:33:02,499 --> 00:33:06,474
This is not
frozen sugar water.

00:33:06,474 --> 00:33:08,472
And we would love for you all
to try them now.

00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:12,476
Our sons will sit
at the dinner table all night

00:33:12,476 --> 00:33:13,493
before touching spinach,

00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:16,472
but they love
our citrus cucumber flavor,

00:33:16,472 --> 00:33:19,477
and it has a hearty helping
of spinach in it.

00:33:19,477 --> 00:33:21,479
Herjavec: Teresa, what are
the flavors we have?

00:33:21,479 --> 00:33:25,472
We have carrot Berry, citrus
cucumber, and sweet potato pie.

00:33:25,472 --> 00:33:26,473
Wow.

00:33:26,473 --> 00:33:27,501
It's really good.
Thank you.

00:33:27,501 --> 00:33:31,494
This is gluten-free, this
is dairy-free, this is vegan.

00:33:31,494 --> 00:33:34,489
I thought it was gonna taste
like crap, and it's pretty good.

00:33:34,489 --> 00:33:37,474
Thank you.

00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:40,492
Agave's very expensive, so what
is it costing you to make this?

00:33:40,492 --> 00:33:42,492
Each package
costs around $1.10.

00:33:42,492 --> 00:33:44,477
There's six pops
per package.

00:33:44,477 --> 00:33:45,497
And what do you
wholesale it for?

00:33:45,497 --> 00:33:48,481
We wholesale
to distributors for $2.25.

00:33:48,481 --> 00:33:49,490
What are
your sales like?

00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,479
Our total sales
are about $30,000.

00:33:51,479 --> 00:33:54,480
Most of that $30,000 has come
within the last few weeks.

00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,482
We started
with Whole Foods.

00:33:56,482 --> 00:33:58,478
Now we just recently
got picked up

00:33:58,478 --> 00:34:02,476
by Sprouts Farmers Markets,
so we're in all 160 Sprouts.

00:34:02,476 --> 00:34:04,482
Tell me the journey
to get to the start.

00:34:04,482 --> 00:34:06,472
Like, what's
your background?

00:34:06,472 --> 00:34:08,497
My husband was
in law school last year,

00:34:08,497 --> 00:34:11,494
and I've been mostly mama,
hence the Veggie Mama.

00:34:11,494 --> 00:34:14,476
And just talking to moms,
they'd ask me,

00:34:14,476 --> 00:34:16,479
"how do your kids eat
so healthy?"

00:34:16,479 --> 00:34:18,491
And I would tell them,
"I make green smoothies."

00:34:18,491 --> 00:34:21,475
And they kind of looked at me
like, "it's just too much work."

00:34:21,475 --> 00:34:22,494
And I understand.
Moms are busy.

00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:24,484
They need something
quick, easy.

00:34:24,484 --> 00:34:26,491
So I said, "why can't I take
the smoothie idea,

00:34:26,491 --> 00:34:28,490
combine fruit-and-vegetable
combinations

00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:30,478
that create
this vibrant color,

00:34:30,478 --> 00:34:33,479
and he was so much
more interested in
this than law school.

00:34:33,479 --> 00:34:34,493
We said,
"hey, let's go for it."

00:34:34,493 --> 00:34:36,480
Well, the best part
of all this --

00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,473
one less lawyer,
so that's a good thing.

00:34:38,473 --> 00:34:39,498
Yeah. That's what
my father would say.

00:34:39,498 --> 00:34:42,476
Tell us
about your production.

00:34:42,476 --> 00:34:43,492
What -- what --
how do you make it?

00:34:43,492 --> 00:34:45,494
What's the capacity?
How much more could you make?

00:34:45,494 --> 00:34:48,500
We definitely have room
for more production.

00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,474
We can handle it.

00:34:50,474 --> 00:34:52,483
We have our own facility
in Southern California.

00:34:52,483 --> 00:34:54,493
How -- how much money did you
guys invest in this thing?

00:34:54,493 --> 00:34:57,487
A total investment has
been about $140,000.

00:34:58,485 --> 00:35:00,481
And the money is your own
personal money?

00:35:00,481 --> 00:35:02,476
We have about $30,000
of our own,

00:35:02,476 --> 00:35:04,476
and $110,000
from family and friends.

00:35:04,476 --> 00:35:05,486
Who's running
the machinery?

00:35:05,486 --> 00:35:07,486
We are.
I am full-time.

00:35:07,486 --> 00:35:09,475
I am working
full-time, yes.
He has a separate
job full time.

00:35:09,475 --> 00:35:11,491
How much are you making
in your job right now?

00:35:11,491 --> 00:35:13,489
$67,000.
Okay.

00:35:13,489 --> 00:35:14,496
For $67,000,
I could buy you

00:35:14,496 --> 00:35:16,483
as a full-time employee
for this business, right?

00:35:16,483 --> 00:35:18,488
Absolutely.

00:35:18,488 --> 00:35:20,490
Guys, I'm gonna simplify it
for the other sharks here.

00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:22,500
Um, I hate the frozen-food
business.

00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,495
It's gonna be so expensive
to take this nationwide.

00:35:25,495 --> 00:35:27,501
I don't know
that you're ready for it.

00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:30,488
And more importantly,
I don't know that I'm
ready for the scramble.

00:35:30,488 --> 00:35:33,484
So for that reason,
I'm out.

00:35:36,492 --> 00:35:39,495
You have something very opposite
to every one of the partners

00:35:39,495 --> 00:35:42,473
I'm in business with
in the food business.

00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:45,486
You have $140,000 in cash
in your business

00:35:45,486 --> 00:35:48,484
and you have $30,000
in sales.

00:35:48,484 --> 00:35:51,492
Every one of my other four
partners initially,

00:35:51,492 --> 00:35:55,474
at the same stage as you, had
roughly the reverse of that.

00:35:55,474 --> 00:35:58,488
I'm afraid of the numbers.
And for that, I'm out.

00:36:03,501 --> 00:36:05,497
You know,
I'll make you an offer.

00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:08,478
I would give you
the $75,000.

00:36:08,478 --> 00:36:09,491
And the way
I get paid back

00:36:09,491 --> 00:36:11,498
is I'm gonna make 50 cents
off every unit sold

00:36:11,498 --> 00:36:13,487
until I get
my capital back,

00:36:13,487 --> 00:36:15,477
then it's gonna drop
to 25 cents.

00:36:15,477 --> 00:36:17,476
I get no equity.

00:36:17,476 --> 00:36:20,481
I've done this structure
other times with food.

00:36:20,481 --> 00:36:21,501
I'd have you talk
to probably the people

00:36:21,501 --> 00:36:24,481
that own wicked good cupcakes
'cause they're just like you.

00:36:24,481 --> 00:36:27,475
And we've turned that
into a monster success.

00:36:27,475 --> 00:36:28,479
Huge.

00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:30,500
You want half
of everything they make?

00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,495
It'll be half
for about 5h months.

00:36:32,495 --> 00:36:34,480
There's no product
like this.

00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,489
You've got to go
with this.

00:36:36,489 --> 00:36:43,497
My only concern is $75,000
isn't enough money

00:36:43,497 --> 00:36:46,493
for somebody to go out there
and do all that calling

00:36:46,493 --> 00:36:47,498
and do the inventory

00:36:47,498 --> 00:36:49,489
and get the cost of goods
and all the other stuff.

00:36:49,489 --> 00:36:51,497
Here's my offer.

00:36:51,497 --> 00:36:55,497
I'll give you $75,000
for 25%

00:36:55,497 --> 00:37:00,472
and, probably within
the next 6 to 12 months, Robert,

00:37:00,472 --> 00:37:02,496
for you to come back
into the business full time,

00:37:02,496 --> 00:37:04,501
I'll give you
an additional $75,000,

00:37:04,501 --> 00:37:06,489
so it doesn't have to
come out of the business.

00:37:06,489 --> 00:37:12,472
So alogether
$150,000 for 25%.

00:37:12,472 --> 00:37:13,495
Okay.
Okay.

00:37:13,495 --> 00:37:14,501
Thank you.

00:37:14,501 --> 00:37:16,488
You're thinking
about that?

00:37:16,488 --> 00:37:18,497
I'm thinking about that,
definitely.

00:37:18,497 --> 00:37:21,481
We're open to listening
to any other offers.

00:37:28,473 --> 00:37:30,489
I love the product.
I think it's great.

00:37:30,489 --> 00:37:33,487
I'm going to make you
an offer.

00:37:33,487 --> 00:37:35,477
I'm gonna give you
the $75,000,

00:37:35,477 --> 00:37:38,479
and I would like 20%.

00:37:38,479 --> 00:37:40,498
And if there needs
to be more money

00:37:40,498 --> 00:37:43,498
and we're really rolling,
I'll provide it.

00:37:43,498 --> 00:37:47,487
I can get us
into all of the best stores

00:37:47,487 --> 00:37:49,492
because I have
all the connections.

00:37:49,492 --> 00:37:52,483
And we're gonna build this
into the best

00:37:52,483 --> 00:37:55,501
and number-one frozen veggie pop
in the world.

00:37:55,501 --> 00:37:58,495
I'm gonna spice it up here
in the shark tank a little bit.

00:37:58,495 --> 00:38:00,477
I'm gonna modify
my offer

00:38:00,477 --> 00:38:03,481
because I actually think getting
Robert full time is crucial.

00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:05,484
I write you a check
for $150,000,

00:38:05,484 --> 00:38:06,493
you quit your job
tomorrow morning

00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:07,499
or as soon
as you get the cash,

00:38:07,499 --> 00:38:10,491
and then you start
selling this.

00:38:10,491 --> 00:38:13,481
You start paying me
50 cents a unit

00:38:13,481 --> 00:38:15,480
until I get
my $150,000 back.

00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,475
After I get back my $150,000,
I get 25 cents a unit.

00:38:19,475 --> 00:38:21,495
I'm your bank.
I don't need your equity.

00:38:21,495 --> 00:38:23,483
Okay.

00:38:27,494 --> 00:38:31,485
Well, you know, whenever Kevin
likes to spice things up,

00:38:31,485 --> 00:38:34,484
it makes us want to
spice things up even more.

00:38:34,484 --> 00:38:36,481
Okay.
Robert.

00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:37,500
Herjavec: I want to come in
with Lori.

00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,500
I'd love to be in on this
'cause I think

00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,479
she believes in you guys
just like I believe in you guys.

00:38:42,479 --> 00:38:46,479
I'll go down to the 20%.
So, $75,000 for 20%.

00:38:46,479 --> 00:38:48,495
At the time that Robert's
ready to come back in,

00:38:48,495 --> 00:38:51,479
we'll give you another
$75,000 for that salary.

00:38:51,479 --> 00:38:53,499
But because you're getting
two of us,

00:38:53,499 --> 00:38:57,483
we want a 20-cent royalty
along the way.

00:38:58,486 --> 00:38:59,499
Ooh.

00:38:59,499 --> 00:39:02,496
Now you have to give up
royalties and equity.

00:39:02,496 --> 00:39:04,472
There's a lesson there.

00:39:04,472 --> 00:39:05,495
When you offer
something for sale

00:39:05,495 --> 00:39:08,480
and you put the deal
on the table and they say yes,

00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,496
you don't look over
their shoulder.

00:39:09,496 --> 00:39:12,486
Robert offered you
more than you asked for,

00:39:12,486 --> 00:39:14,490
and you didn't respond.

00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:16,477
Let me put this
in a different way.

00:39:16,477 --> 00:39:18,477
When you walk
into the shark tank,

00:39:18,477 --> 00:39:19,487
you look for the sucker,

00:39:19,487 --> 00:39:22,480
and if you don't see one,
it's you.

00:39:29,496 --> 00:39:32,490
Narrator:
Two sharks are out.

00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:36,475
Teresa and Robert have
two offers on the table.

00:39:36,475 --> 00:39:40,495
Kevin has offered $150,000
for a 50-cent royalty,

00:39:40,495 --> 00:39:44,490
which goes down to 25 cents
after he recoups his investment.

00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:48,483
Lori and Robert
have also offered $150,000,

00:39:48,483 --> 00:39:51,493
but for a 20% stake,
plus a 20-cent royalty.

00:39:51,493 --> 00:39:55,486
So, you're
one handshake away.

00:39:55,486 --> 00:39:57,494
So, let me stop you and make you
think about something.

00:39:58,499 --> 00:40:01,486
You have two offers
on the table,

00:40:01,486 --> 00:40:03,494
but they both have royalties
you don't like.

00:40:03,494 --> 00:40:06,473
You are in a very good
negotiating position.

00:40:06,473 --> 00:40:07,490
Why don't you guys
go talk about it

00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:09,472
and regroup a little bit?

00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,484
We'll be right back.

00:40:11,484 --> 00:40:13,473
Thank you all.
One moment.
Thank you.

00:40:14,477 --> 00:40:17,480
Barbara, when did you become
the teacher of the tank?

00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,487
Why do you have to
have the royalty?

00:40:18,487 --> 00:40:19,492
Let's just drop it.

00:40:19,492 --> 00:40:21,497
You know, Barbara,
I might have done that.

00:40:21,497 --> 00:40:23,499
It's unfair.
A catfight.

00:40:26,478 --> 00:40:28,480
Should we try to get
our equity down?

00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,488
Or, I don't --

00:40:29,488 --> 00:40:31,493
I think we should do away
with the royalty.
Me too.

00:40:31,493 --> 00:40:33,483
When did you become
so crusty?

00:40:33,483 --> 00:40:34,501
It's just annoying
because we're taking advantage

00:40:34,501 --> 00:40:36,493
of these very good people.
You're being mean to Lori.

00:40:36,493 --> 00:40:38,493
You're piping up
at all the wrong times.
What are you talking about?

00:40:38,493 --> 00:40:40,480
Drop the royalty and hit
a home run with these people.

00:40:41,482 --> 00:40:43,481
We're back.

00:40:43,481 --> 00:40:46,473
Robert: We really
appreciate the offers,

00:40:46,473 --> 00:40:47,487
and we appreciate
your experience

00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:49,472
and the connections
that you have.

00:40:49,472 --> 00:40:53,480
I think where we are stuck
is the 20-cent royalty.

00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,492
What's your counter?

00:40:55,492 --> 00:40:58,483
We'll keep
the $75,000 now,

00:40:58,483 --> 00:41:00,499
$75,000 in the future
when we need Robert,

00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:02,493
and keep you at 20%.

00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:05,500
It's a good counter, but I want
to stay with the royalty.

00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:09,483
You're getting the two of us.
It's a fair amount of equity.

00:41:09,483 --> 00:41:12,495
A lower --
do you know that the 20-cent
royalty going forward...

00:41:12,495 --> 00:41:14,479
A lower royalty
than Kevin's.

00:41:14,479 --> 00:41:16,478
...is exactly 10%
of everything you sell.

00:41:16,478 --> 00:41:17,500
You realize that?

00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,476
That's like giving them
an extra 10% free stock.

00:41:20,476 --> 00:41:21,481
Is that what you're after?

00:41:22,489 --> 00:41:24,480
Are you coming back in, or are
you just gonna give more --

00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,501
I may be coming back in 'cause
I'm getting so annoyed here.

00:41:25,501 --> 00:41:27,492
No kidding, right?

00:41:27,492 --> 00:41:29,477
You're getting
a lot of free advice here

00:41:29,477 --> 00:41:30,494
from people who aren't
making you an offer.

00:41:30,494 --> 00:41:32,487
And you know the value
of that free advice

00:41:32,487 --> 00:41:35,488
is exactly what you're getting
for it -- nothing.

00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,492
They're not making an offer.

00:41:38,488 --> 00:41:39,496
Why don't we go
knock them out?

00:41:39,496 --> 00:41:41,481
Let's go together
and drop the royalty.

00:41:41,481 --> 00:41:42,484
Yeah, but I don't want to
do the work.

00:41:42,484 --> 00:41:44,482
Well, I'll do the work.
You know I will.

00:41:44,482 --> 00:41:45,487
You want to do the work?

00:41:45,487 --> 00:41:46,492
Yeah, let's go in
and knock them out.

00:41:46,492 --> 00:41:48,498
Guys, you know what?
We're tired of it.

00:41:48,498 --> 00:41:51,496
75k for 20%,
done deal, no royalty.

00:41:53,493 --> 00:41:54,495
Done.
Let's do it.

00:41:54,495 --> 00:41:56,476
We would love to do
a deal with you.

00:41:56,476 --> 00:41:57,491
Thank God.

00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:01,490
Congratulations, guys.

00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:02,499
Thank you.
My pleasure.

00:42:02,499 --> 00:42:05,474
Thank you so much.
Thanks, guys.

00:42:06,479 --> 00:42:08,481
Cuban: [ Laughs ]

00:42:08,481 --> 00:42:10,483
I would pay 75k
just to not listen

00:42:10,483 --> 00:42:12,486
to that anymore.
Yeah, exactly.
It was enough already.

00:42:12,486 --> 00:42:13,500
Good luck.

00:42:15,472 --> 00:42:17,488
Robert: We envisioned ourselves
coming in here today,

00:42:17,488 --> 00:42:21,484
leaving with a deal
with Mark Cuban and Barbara,

00:42:21,484 --> 00:42:24,485
and at the end of the day,
that's exactly what we did.

00:42:24,485 --> 00:42:26,485
Good job. Love you.
Love you.
