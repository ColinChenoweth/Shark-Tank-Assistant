and then what do I do?

Quinn: You just take it
out of the pouch.

00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:30,359
You dip it in water,

00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:32,358
and that activates
the resin that's in the tape.

00:04:32,358 --> 00:04:33,357
So it's
water-activated.

00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:34,356
You wrap it around
the broken item,

00:04:34,356 --> 00:04:35,378
and after
about five minutes,

00:04:35,378 --> 00:04:37,353
it's gonna start
to harden.

00:04:37,353 --> 00:04:39,353
You have to put it
in water, and you have to --

00:04:39,353 --> 00:04:41,353
you -- you can't touch it
with your bare hands?

00:04:41,353 --> 00:04:42,358
Child: Well, you're not
gonna want to

00:04:42,358 --> 00:04:43,378
because it's -- it's --
it's really sticky,

00:04:43,378 --> 00:04:44,379
and once you
get that on your hands,

00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:46,370
it's gonna be there
for awhile.

00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,375
Now, that's
sticky right now.
So, what do you
charge me for this?

00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,367

in three different sizes.

and the one-inch
costs $5.99.

is under $2, landed.

of QVC when you're with me.

huge opportunity here

is the infomercial-spot
market.
Right.

I'll tell you honestly,

00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,371
you really need
the right partner.

00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:27,353
You need somebody
who knows the ropes

00:07:27,353 --> 00:07:29,353
and who also knows who are
the good partners to be with.

Is it men or women?

We believe
it's probably men.
O'Leary:
I don't think a lot of women

applying this.

So, where do you think -- where
do you think most guys shop?

Do you think they shop
online and infomercials,

00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:44,372
or do you think
they shop

00:07:44,372 --> 00:07:46,351
in a hardware store
with this other stuff?

He's wrong.
Well, there's a lot
of women on --

tell you he's wrong.

to put $1 million, $2 million,
$3 million --

exactly the point.
Yeah, but the media-buyer --

As usual, all roads
lead back to me

Lori, she made you an offer
of $250,000 for 18%.

That's a lot of equity
to give up early on, of course.

so simple for you.

Okay.

game strategy of "Shark Tank."

00:11:25,357 --> 00:11:26,374

00:14:21,368 --> 00:14:23,355
It's a great product.
Child:
It is a great product.

00:14:23,355 --> 00:14:24,364
[ Sighs ]

00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,364
Greiner: All right.
Thanks, guys.

00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,358
Uh-huh. Good luck.

00:14:27,358 --> 00:14:28,361
Right on, baby!

00:14:28,361 --> 00:14:29,373
I would have
never done that.

00:14:29,373 --> 00:14:31,359
I felt like they were the sharks
and you were pitching them.

00:14:31,359 --> 00:14:33,365
You know what?
You guys!

00:14:33,365 --> 00:14:36,368
It's disgusting
how much you criticize

00:14:36,368 --> 00:14:38,700
when I'm the winner
and you're the loser.

00:14:43,364 --> 00:14:45,374
Narrator: Last season,
Jeff Stafford and Dusty Holloway

00:14:45,374 --> 00:14:49,353
made a deal with Mark Cuban
for their product, Shellbobbers,

00:14:49,353 --> 00:14:51,376
fishing bobbers
made from shotgun shells.

00:14:51,376 --> 00:14:54,358
Deal? Done.
Yes. We will
accept your offer.

00:14:54,358 --> 00:14:56,700
Narrator: Let's see
how they're doing now.

00:15:01,702 --> 00:15:03,706
Stafford: Business has been
awesome since "Shark Tank."

00:15:03,706 --> 00:15:04,720
It feels like I'm on
a roller coaster

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,712
that's going, like,
3,000 miles an hour.

00:15:07,712 --> 00:15:10,706
After landing our deal,
we knew we had to scale quickly.

00:15:10,706 --> 00:15:13,705
We moved into
a 3,500-square-foot facility,

00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,705
hired a team of employees,

00:15:15,705 --> 00:15:16,721
and brought in the automation
we needed

00:15:16,721 --> 00:15:18,719
to pump these things
out quick.

00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:23,706
I went from making 100 a day
to 25,000 every day.

00:15:23,706 --> 00:15:24,720
Cool. Cool.
Got it.
All right?

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,712
Thanks, man.

00:15:26,712 --> 00:15:27,720
It feels really good

00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,723
being able to keep shellbobbers
made in America.

00:15:30,723 --> 00:15:33,707
To be able to provide jobs
in our hometown

00:15:33,707 --> 00:15:34,719
has just been
really cool to see.

00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:36,698
Perfect. Ready to go.
Stafford: Thank you.

00:15:36,698 --> 00:15:39,708
Before "Shark Tank," we had less
than $1,000 in sales.

00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,704
After making our deal
with mark,

00:15:41,704 --> 00:15:45,713
we're in the largest retailer
in the world, 7-Eleven.

00:15:45,713 --> 00:15:47,715
Now we're projecting
over $1 million in sales

00:15:47,715 --> 00:15:49,703
over the next
12 months.

00:15:49,703 --> 00:15:50,713
It's two pallets.
Two pallets, yeah.

00:15:50,713 --> 00:15:52,696
I can have that out
by Thursday.

00:15:52,696 --> 00:15:55,712
The experience has been a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,

00:15:55,712 --> 00:15:57,703
and it's all thanks
to "Shark Tank."

00:15:57,703 --> 00:15:59,698
All: Thank you, "Shark Tank"!

00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:00,701
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!

00:16:10,716 --> 00:16:11,716
I'm Amanda Adams.

00:16:11,716 --> 00:16:12,716
I'm Jason Adams.

00:16:12,716 --> 00:16:14,694
And we're
from Mckinney, Texas.

00:16:14,694 --> 00:16:17,697
Amanda and I met a year ago
on a blind date.

00:16:17,697 --> 00:16:19,722
We fell in love and got married
within six weeks.

00:16:19,722 --> 00:16:21,694
We both had kids,

00:16:21,694 --> 00:16:23,700
so we blended
our families together,

00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,705
and now we're expecting
a baby boy.

00:16:25,705 --> 00:16:27,711
Combining two
already-established families

00:16:27,711 --> 00:16:29,710
is difficult
and takes a lot of work.

00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,705
You've got to find
a good way to communicate.

00:16:31,705 --> 00:16:33,721
But if we put that
like that?

00:16:33,721 --> 00:16:34,721
That could work.

00:16:34,721 --> 00:16:36,699
We developed
a product

00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:38,694
to save marriages
and relationships.

00:16:38,694 --> 00:16:40,703
It was born out of love
to help couples like us

00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,699
communicate our thoughts
and feelings,

00:16:42,699 --> 00:16:43,702
even when it's tough.

00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:45,704
We know people.
We know relationships.

00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,698
Manufacturing,
price points, and margins

00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:48,721
are not
our strong points.

00:16:48,721 --> 00:16:51,706
This is where the sharks
can really help us.

00:16:51,706 --> 00:16:53,696
We need to make
this deal.

00:16:53,696 --> 00:16:56,717
We've invested over $100,000
to make our dream a reality.

00:16:56,717 --> 00:16:58,700
And we feel
very passionate

00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,707
that this can help save
millions of relationships.

00:17:19,711 --> 00:17:21,695
Hello, sharks.
I'm Jason.

00:17:21,695 --> 00:17:22,695
I'm Amanda.

00:17:22,695 --> 00:17:23,700
This is baby Koa.

00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,700
And we are
the Adams family.

00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,717
Our company
is Elephant Chat,

00:17:26,717 --> 00:17:29,721
and we're seeking
a $50,000 investment

00:17:29,721 --> 00:17:32,697
for a 20% stake
in our company.

00:17:32,697 --> 00:17:34,704
No one likes those "we need
to talk" conversations.

00:17:34,704 --> 00:17:36,696
But they are
necessary.

00:17:36,696 --> 00:17:39,200
And most of the time,
you don't know that you
need to have that talk

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,208
until you start getting
the cold shoulder

00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,219
and end up
sleeping on the couch.

00:17:42,219 --> 00:17:43,223
Until now.

00:17:43,223 --> 00:17:45,214
We designed a product
that allows you

00:17:45,214 --> 00:17:46,222
to visually tell
your partner

00:17:46,222 --> 00:17:48,214
you have something
to talk about.

00:17:48,214 --> 00:17:51,222
Introducing
the elephant in the room.

00:17:51,222 --> 00:17:53,222
John: Oh, lord.

00:17:53,222 --> 00:17:55,199
[ Laughter ]

00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,200
Is that
a stuffed animal?

00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,199
It is
a stuffed elephant.

00:18:01,202 --> 00:18:03,226
So, when I see the toilet seat
has been left up

00:18:03,226 --> 00:18:05,208
for the millionth time,

00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,224
I don't have to be ready
to pounce on him

00:18:06,224 --> 00:18:08,200
when he walks
through the door

00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,213
or be mad when he doesn't
realize I'm upset.

00:18:10,213 --> 00:18:12,209
I simply remove
the cover

00:18:12,209 --> 00:18:14,223
and reveal the elephant
in the room.

00:18:14,223 --> 00:18:16,225
So, when I get home and I see
the elephant is in the room,

00:18:16,225 --> 00:18:18,212
I immediately know
that she has something

00:18:18,212 --> 00:18:19,225
she wants
to talk about,

00:18:19,225 --> 00:18:21,210
which allows me
to understand her mood,

00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,218
but gives me time
to settle in.

00:18:22,218 --> 00:18:24,213
Then when I'm ready,
I simply say,

00:18:24,213 --> 00:18:26,217
"you want to talk about
the elephant in the room?"

00:18:26,217 --> 00:18:28,225
And one of the best rules
about Elephant Chat

00:18:28,225 --> 00:18:31,219
is that you can only talk
if you're holding the elephant.

00:18:31,219 --> 00:18:32,225
So, which one
of you sharks

00:18:32,225 --> 00:18:35,200
would like to be the first
to talk about

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,220
the elephant
in the room?
Oh. Lord.

00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,214
Amanda,
how long you been married?

00:18:40,214 --> 00:18:43,220
Um, well, actually, today
is our 13th-month anniversary.

00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,203
Is one of you
a therapist?

00:18:45,203 --> 00:18:46,208
We are not.

00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,210
What we landed on
was this worked for us.

00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,227
John: If you're
really married --

00:18:49,227 --> 00:18:52,201
and they
obviously are.
Yeah, you know
the rules.

00:18:52,201 --> 00:18:53,202
There's
one person right

00:18:53,202 --> 00:18:54,209
and the other person's
the husband.

00:18:54,209 --> 00:18:55,226
[ Laughter ]
Yeah.
That's it.

00:18:55,226 --> 00:18:58,212
Th-there's -- there's --
there's nothing to discuss.

00:18:58,212 --> 00:19:00,199
[ Laughter ]

00:19:00,199 --> 00:19:02,211
So, how much
does each one cost to make?

00:19:02,211 --> 00:19:06,207
To make -- on our very first run
of 500, it was $22.

00:19:06,207 --> 00:19:07,220
Whoa!
Oh, my goodness.
Whoa! Each?

00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,227
Whoa!
Greiner: You know,
can I see the box, 'cause I --

00:19:09,227 --> 00:19:12,212
O'Leary: You have to sell the --
the elephant for 150 bucks!
Jason, what do you sell
the elephant for?

00:19:12,212 --> 00:19:14,204
$59 is what
we're looking at.

00:19:14,204 --> 00:19:17,207
[ Laughs ]
How much money did you put
to start the business?

00:19:17,207 --> 00:19:19,204
Okay.
We -- we raised $100,000.

00:19:20,222 --> 00:19:22,205
Raised?

00:19:22,205 --> 00:19:23,227
We have seven -- we just --
our local friends.

00:19:23,227 --> 00:19:25,203
[ Laughter ]

00:19:25,203 --> 00:19:26,212
They won't be friends
for long.

00:19:26,212 --> 00:19:28,201
Greiner:
You guys, the thing is,

00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:31,221
like, a stuffed elephant animal
is very inexpensive to make.

00:19:31,221 --> 00:19:33,199
That's correct.

00:19:33,199 --> 00:19:34,224
It costs you
a lot of money

00:19:34,224 --> 00:19:37,213
to go into that box
with tooling,

00:19:37,213 --> 00:19:39,222
so, to make the decision
and spend that much money

00:19:39,222 --> 00:19:43,210
when you're a brand-new business
is a wonderment to me,

00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:45,224
because that's a risk
and it's a big expense.

00:19:45,224 --> 00:19:47,203
You know what?

00:19:47,203 --> 00:19:49,210
The -- the finances actually
worked out the best for us,

00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,217
'cause, as we started
to look

00:19:50,217 --> 00:19:52,228
at all the other boxes
that existed out there,

00:19:52,228 --> 00:19:54,206
there wasn't another way

00:19:54,206 --> 00:19:57,222
to get a clear plastic
inside of a covered plastic.

00:19:57,222 --> 00:20:00,209
But, Jason, just staying
on theme here for a second...

00:20:00,209 --> 00:20:03,227
Yes.
...I go online,
I click on stuffed elephants.

00:20:03,227 --> 00:20:06,205
Here's one for $2.99.

00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,200
Here's one for $69.

00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,228
That's right.
[ Laughter ]

00:20:09,228 --> 00:20:11,210
Herjavec: $59.

00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,205
I get exactly
what you're saying.

00:20:13,205 --> 00:20:14,221
The -- the issue here,
is that says,

00:20:14,221 --> 00:20:16,220
every single person
has -- has something

00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,220
that they really
want to say.

00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,208
Can I have the elephant?

00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,200
Yes.

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,210
Thank you.

00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,218
When you
first start out,

00:20:25,218 --> 00:20:27,204
one -- you do it
as inexpensively

00:20:27,204 --> 00:20:29,200
as you possibly can,
because you don't know

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,201
if this will succeed.

00:20:30,201 --> 00:20:32,204
Two -- I think
it's very important

00:20:32,204 --> 00:20:34,220
to offer something
at a very affordable price.

00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,227
It wasn't
gonna work for me,

00:20:35,227 --> 00:20:37,203
for her
to take it serious

00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:38,225
that I wanted to build
better communications

00:20:38,225 --> 00:20:40,206
if it was $19.99
for two of them

00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:41,218
and I got a free snuggie
with it.

00:20:41,218 --> 00:20:44,217
But, you guys,
at $60 apiece,

00:20:44,217 --> 00:20:46,203
I don't think
it would ever sell.

00:20:47,216 --> 00:20:48,216
I'm out.

00:20:48,216 --> 00:20:49,216
Well, thank you.

00:20:49,216 --> 00:20:50,216
Thank you, Lori.

00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:52,200
So, our first strategy

00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,215
is that we've
made relationships and inroads

00:20:53,215 --> 00:20:54,223
with the marriage
counseling

00:20:54,223 --> 00:20:57,199
and other counseling
industries, so --
[ laughs ]

00:20:57,199 --> 00:20:58,199
You're kidding.
O'Leary: You got to be
kidding.

00:20:58,199 --> 00:21:00,216
I would buy that box
for $60,

00:21:00,216 --> 00:21:04,214
open it up, and find
a $1 stuffed elephant in it.

00:21:04,214 --> 00:21:06,205
If your phone number
was in there...

00:21:06,205 --> 00:21:09,210
[ Laughter ]

00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,222
...you can sell me
some tickets

00:21:10,222 --> 00:21:14,223
to an anger-management show,
because I would be very unhappy.

00:21:14,223 --> 00:21:16,199
The consumer experience

00:21:16,199 --> 00:21:18,199
of getting completely
ripped off blind

00:21:18,199 --> 00:21:19,222
is going to be
an unpleasant one.

00:21:19,222 --> 00:21:21,205
Well --

00:21:21,205 --> 00:21:22,206
and -- and for
that reason, Jason,

00:21:22,206 --> 00:21:24,224
um, I'm definitely out.

00:21:24,224 --> 00:21:27,219
Okay.

00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:30,203
My wife gets really mad
at me sometimes.

from the marriage counselors

that we've talked to,
they love the idea,

00:21:41,213 --> 00:21:42,227
because right now,
they use this method,

00:21:42,227 --> 00:21:46,225
but they use it with pencils
and random objects.

the first 500 units.

Um, if I came home,

00:22:04,213 --> 00:22:06,218
this would be
an early warning signal.

00:22:06,218 --> 00:22:08,209
I would
slide out the window

00:22:08,209 --> 00:22:10,212
and hop the back gate
and go to a bar

00:22:10,212 --> 00:22:12,200
and not come home
until the next day...
Exactly.

00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,200
...because this would mean that,
"honey, we have to talk."

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,209
Maybe that's why
you're not married.

00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,258
on board
through your connections,

00:35:38,258 --> 00:35:41,271
those accounts throw off
a very nice-size residual.

00:35:41,271 --> 00:35:44,264
Jason, Kevin's example
of the dog groomer --

00:35:44,264 --> 00:35:47,256
if someone's doing $80,000
a year and they need 20 grand,

00:35:47,256 --> 00:35:49,261
there's no way
that business could afford

00:35:49,261 --> 00:35:51,263
to pay you back
in 12 months.
It could. It could.

00:35:51,263 --> 00:35:53,248
So, we already have
a successful track record.

00:35:53,248 --> 00:35:55,265
We only started
with $5,000, okay?

00:35:55,265 --> 00:35:59,265
That $5,000 has grown over time
to be worth over $100,000.

00:35:59,265 --> 00:36:03,249
Greiner: You guys, I'm not
really sure about all of this,

00:36:03,249 --> 00:36:06,273
and for that reason,
I'm out.

00:36:06,273 --> 00:36:08,264
Okay.
Okay.

00:36:08,264 --> 00:36:11,262
I -- a tanning salon
in bayside, queens. All right?

00:36:11,262 --> 00:36:13,263
Air-conditioning unit
blows on --

00:36:13,263 --> 00:36:14,264
hey, I went to
bayside high.

00:36:14,264 --> 00:36:16,258
A guy needs $18,000

00:36:16,258 --> 00:36:17,277
to fix his hvac
on his roof, right?

00:36:17,277 --> 00:36:20,275
How long does it take
a guy running a tanning salon

00:36:20,275 --> 00:36:22,275
to get $18,000 together
to fix the thing on the roof?
Herjavec: Never.

00:36:22,275 --> 00:36:24,270
Right.
If I'm not there,
he's out of business.
Yeah.

00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:26,257
We get him funded
in three or four days.

00:36:26,257 --> 00:36:28,266
Herjavec:
All right, Jason, look,
there is an entire subset

00:36:28,266 --> 00:36:31,264
of small businesses
that cannot get a loan,

00:36:31,264 --> 00:36:34,258
but it -- it's
not a market for me.

00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:36,265
This isn't a business
that I would want to be in.

00:36:36,265 --> 00:36:37,277
I'm out.

00:36:37,277 --> 00:36:40,250
Even though
there's a 400% return

00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,258
in less than a year,
two years?

00:36:41,258 --> 00:36:43,269
That's a pretty --

00:36:43,269 --> 00:36:45,267
I mean, it's -- we have
a successful track record.
Cuban: But, guys,
that's part of the problem.

00:36:45,267 --> 00:36:46,276
That -- that -- that's
the upside and the downside.

00:36:46,276 --> 00:36:49,265
The risk
is government, right?

00:36:49,265 --> 00:36:51,264
Right now,
there aren't limitations,

00:36:51,264 --> 00:36:52,276
but it's almost
like payday loans,

00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:55,262
until they got so popular
people started to complain,

00:36:55,262 --> 00:36:57,255
and then
the government stepped in

00:36:57,255 --> 00:36:59,251
and started to introduce
regulations.

00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:00,277
We have testimonials --
no joke --

00:37:00,277 --> 00:37:03,252
where clients were actually
crying on the phone

00:37:03,252 --> 00:37:04,263
saying,
"val, I'm so happy

00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:06,257
that you were able
to get this to me,"

00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:08,268
because we want to be able
to come through for them.

00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:10,275
Look, I get it.
There's a value.

00:37:10,275 --> 00:37:13,250
I'd actually rather see them
go through you

00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,270
than take a loan
from the bank,

00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:16,274
because at least you guys
will care and work with them,

00:37:16,274 --> 00:37:18,274
but it still makes me
feel uncomfortable.

00:37:18,274 --> 00:37:21,264
You know, they always say
that when something goes wrong,

00:37:21,264 --> 00:37:23,252
they go to
the deepest pockets.

00:37:23,252 --> 00:37:25,276
And I'd be
your deepest pockets.

00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:27,262
For that reason,
I'm out.

00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,260
Daymond?

00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,273
I'm out.

00:37:36,264 --> 00:37:37,277
O'Leary: I happen to think

00:37:37,277 --> 00:37:40,261
that what you do
is a necessary --

00:37:40,261 --> 00:37:42,264
and some of these sharks
think -- it's a necessary evil.

00:37:42,264 --> 00:37:45,264
It's still necessary
to keep a business afloat.

00:37:45,264 --> 00:37:46,271
That's all that matters.

00:37:46,271 --> 00:37:48,249
I'm gonna make
the assumption

00:37:48,249 --> 00:37:49,261
that you were smart enough
to get in front of me

00:37:49,261 --> 00:37:51,252
in "Shark Tank," that I should
be your partner.

00:37:52,273 --> 00:37:55,274
But that will not happen
unless I have 50%.

00:37:55,274 --> 00:37:57,268
Ba-bam.

00:38:06,272 --> 00:38:08,277
Narrator: Four sharks are out.

00:38:08,277 --> 00:38:12,253
Kevin is Jason and Val's
last chance for a deal.

00:38:12,253 --> 00:38:13,265
O'Leary: I'm gonna make
the assumption

00:38:13,265 --> 00:38:15,271
that you were smart enough
to get in front of me

00:38:15,271 --> 00:38:17,275
in "Shark Tank," that I should
be your partner.

00:38:17,275 --> 00:38:20,269
But that will not happen
unless I have 50%.

00:38:20,269 --> 00:38:21,270
Ba-bam.

00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:23,263
I'll give you $200,000

00:38:23,263 --> 00:38:25,271
to be 50% partner
in this business.

00:38:25,271 --> 00:38:28,269
And I'll probably take you
to a whole new level.

00:38:28,269 --> 00:38:30,258
There's no question
about it.

00:38:30,258 --> 00:38:33,250
I have access to capital
you only dream of.

00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,271
You know what it is?
You know, it's funny, val.

00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:37,260
We were joking with you
about strong-arm tactics,

00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,277
and then you met
Mr. O'Leary

00:38:38,277 --> 00:38:42,277
with the $200,000
for 50% offer.
[ Laughs ]

00:38:42,277 --> 00:38:44,261
Yeah.
I just happen to think

00:38:44,261 --> 00:38:46,263
I bring a tremendous amount
of credibility to this business

00:38:46,263 --> 00:38:49,267
and capital and contacts,

00:38:49,267 --> 00:38:52,259
and for me to ask
to be a 50/50 partner

00:38:52,259 --> 00:38:53,268
is not unreasonable
in my view.

00:38:53,268 --> 00:38:55,275
And so your dis-- distribution
just got cut in half.

00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:00,264
Yeah, so, what you're
asking us to do

00:39:00,264 --> 00:39:02,252
is basically take three years
of our life

00:39:02,252 --> 00:39:04,252
and cut it
in a quarter.
I just put capital
in for $200,000.

00:39:04,252 --> 00:39:05,265
You can't tell me right now
you're worth --

00:39:05,265 --> 00:39:07,258
well, can I --
can I explain -- hold on.
The capital --

00:39:07,258 --> 00:39:09,262
hold on. Can I explain how
we -- we got to the valuation?
No, they didn't ask --

00:39:09,262 --> 00:39:11,251
instead of starting it
myself,

00:39:11,251 --> 00:39:14,271
I'm giving up from day one
half the equity to you two guys.

00:39:14,271 --> 00:39:16,262
That's the way
I look at it,

00:39:16,262 --> 00:39:17,275
because if I want
to do this, I can.

00:39:17,275 --> 00:39:19,261
I can do it myself, okay?

00:39:19,261 --> 00:39:22,270
Cuban: See, in Kevin's defense,
the minute you guys walk out,

00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:25,256
he takes out some ads, goes --
goes to a headhunting firm,

00:39:25,256 --> 00:39:27,264
and says, "you know what?
Find me the best.

00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:29,255
"And I'll pay them --
you know,
if it was that easy --

00:39:29,255 --> 00:39:30,270
Cuban: And I'll pay them
$500,000 a year."
You got the best
in front of you.

00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:32,266
Val, who cares?
What are you gonna do?

00:39:32,266 --> 00:39:34,258
$200,000, 50%.

00:39:35,268 --> 00:39:37,259
What do you think
the probability is

00:39:37,259 --> 00:39:39,251
that people
return my phone call?

00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:40,260
Very high.

00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,264
Thank you.
Go think about it.

00:39:42,264 --> 00:39:43,275
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:39:45,253 --> 00:39:47,267
Whew.
Oh, boy.

00:39:47,267 --> 00:39:48,276
You know,
they brought up a good point.

00:39:48,276 --> 00:39:50,252
How many businesses
on "Shark Tank"

00:39:50,252 --> 00:39:51,263
could use
a processing service like this?

00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:52,263
A lot.

00:39:52,263 --> 00:39:54,249
He's -- he's asking us
to give us --

00:39:54,249 --> 00:39:56,268
it's two times earnings,
and that's insane.
Right. Yeah.

00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:58,268
You know, you really are
the right partner for it.
I think so, too.

00:39:58,268 --> 00:40:00,264
I think they should
take your deal.
You're the only up here
that has that element.

00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:02,249
You know, your only question is,
are these the guys

00:40:02,249 --> 00:40:03,867
who are gonna take you
to the promised land?

00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:08,274
Jason, Val,
welcome back to the tank.

00:40:08,274 --> 00:40:12,251
Kevin made you an offer --
$200,000 for 50%.

00:40:12,251 --> 00:40:16,250
You know, Kevin,
we feel that our sales,

00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:18,274
our revenue, has tremendous
value, as well.

00:40:18,274 --> 00:40:21,258
And granted,
those bar-- barriers to entry,

00:40:21,258 --> 00:40:22,273
like you mentioned --

00:40:22,273 --> 00:40:25,261
guys, I'm paying 10 times what
you put up to start this thing,

00:40:25,261 --> 00:40:26,264
and there's no barriers
to entry.

00:40:26,264 --> 00:40:28,252
Make a counter.

00:40:28,252 --> 00:40:31,261
So we want to do $250,000
for 25% equity.

00:40:32,275 --> 00:40:35,252
No. No.

00:40:35,252 --> 00:40:36,273
Try to be
more reasonable than 50%.

00:40:36,273 --> 00:40:38,265
If I put my name
on a business,

00:40:38,265 --> 00:40:41,253
it's going to geometrically
increase the a.U.M. --

00:40:41,253 --> 00:40:42,266
the assets under management.

00:40:42,266 --> 00:40:43,270
If you don't believe that,

00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:45,248
turn around,
walk out the door.

00:40:45,248 --> 00:40:47,252
You can walk right out
of the Shark Tank

00:40:47,252 --> 00:40:48,258
and you'll stay small.

00:40:50,252 --> 00:40:51,272
Nobody
wants to bid for this?

00:40:51,272 --> 00:40:54,255
You could always say, "I'm not
out." You've heard more.

00:40:54,255 --> 00:40:57,276
John: Guys, guys, you got to
give this guy an answer.
Cuban: Got to
make a call, guys.

00:40:57,276 --> 00:40:59,265
We got to stop
thinking about it.

00:40:59,265 --> 00:41:00,272
It's binary.
Yes or no.

00:41:00,272 --> 00:41:01,272
$200,000 at 40%?

00:41:01,272 --> 00:41:02,272
Nope.

00:41:02,272 --> 00:41:04,259
There is no flexibility,
my friend.

00:41:04,259 --> 00:41:05,277
It's yes or no.
Binary. On or off.

00:41:05,277 --> 00:41:07,262
There's
always flexibility.

00:41:07,262 --> 00:41:08,263
There isn't.

00:41:08,263 --> 00:41:09,265
I-if it was guaranteed

00:41:09,265 --> 00:41:10,276
that we would
be blowing up?

00:41:10,276 --> 00:41:13,248
Jason, come on.
There are no --

00:41:13,248 --> 00:41:14,250
there's no guarantees.
You -- you know
whether or not --

00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:15,258
why don't you guys
just flip a coin?

00:41:15,258 --> 00:41:17,250
Just get it over with.
Just flip a coin.
Flip a coin?

00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,254
Yeah,
if it means that --

00:41:18,254 --> 00:41:19,258
Reddish:
That's life, usually.

00:41:19,258 --> 00:41:21,249
Come on, Jason. You know
what you want to do.

00:41:21,249 --> 00:41:23,254
[ Sighs ]
You got to make a decision.

00:41:23,254 --> 00:41:24,269
Got a coin?

00:41:24,269 --> 00:41:26,275
[ Laughs ]
I'll let you
flip a coin. That's fine.

00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:28,260
Kevin, Kevin.
I got a quarter.

00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,276
Reddish: Hey, is there any way
another shark

00:41:30,276 --> 00:41:32,262
would get involved
at that deal?

00:41:32,262 --> 00:41:35,433
$200,000, 50%,
100, 100.

00:41:35,433 --> 00:41:37,867
My deal is very simple.
You know what it is.

00:41:37,867 --> 00:41:39,567
Do you want me
to flip this coin,

00:41:39,567 --> 00:41:40,571
or do you want
to say yes now?

00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:46,577
I'll say...
I think
we should say yes.

00:41:46,577 --> 00:41:49,557
Heads, we're your partner,
tails, we're your partner.

00:41:49,557 --> 00:41:50,578
You got a deal.

00:41:50,578 --> 00:41:51,580
[ Laughs ]

00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,556
Aw, I wanted to see
the coin flip.

00:41:53,556 --> 00:41:54,568
This is
my favorite coin.

00:41:54,568 --> 00:41:55,578
Wow.
Both sides, I win.

00:41:55,578 --> 00:41:57,578
Can I have that coin?
Would you mind?

00:41:57,578 --> 00:41:59,571
This is
the first distribution.

00:41:59,571 --> 00:42:00,571
Congratulations, guys.

00:42:00,571 --> 00:42:02,568
Congratulations.
Reddish: Thanks.

00:42:02,568 --> 00:42:04,575
Now, this is actually
the one business

00:42:04,575 --> 00:42:06,557
where you put up a little money
and you hire somebody,

00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:07,574
you could replicate it.

00:42:07,574 --> 00:42:08,580
I could have.

00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,578
But what I like is they've got
an existing book,

00:42:10,578 --> 00:42:12,568
and they're probably
good foot soldiers.

00:42:12,568 --> 00:42:13,568
My man!

00:42:13,568 --> 00:42:14,579
Whoo!
