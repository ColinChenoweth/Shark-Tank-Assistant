00:00:00,433 --> 00:00:02,000
Narrator:
Tonight special guest shark,

00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,002
billionaire founder
of Paul Mitchell,

00:00:04,002 --> 00:00:05,993
John Paul DeJoria
joins the sharks.

00:00:05,993 --> 00:00:08,533
In the tank,
hopeful entrepreneurs

00:00:08,533 --> 00:00:11,525
get a once-in-a-lifetime chance
to pitch the sharks

00:00:11,525 --> 00:00:13,515
in hopes of
getting an investment

00:00:13,515 --> 00:00:16,525
to start, grow,
or save their businesses.

00:00:16,525 --> 00:00:17,539
Can I finish
the rest of my information?

00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:19,513
[ Laughing ] Oh, man!

00:00:19,513 --> 00:00:20,520
It's the worst pitch
I've ever seen.

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,534
Narrator: The entrepreneurs
must convince a shark

00:00:22,534 --> 00:00:24,539
to invest the full amount
they're asking for,

00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,535
or they'll
walk away with nothing.

00:00:26,535 --> 00:00:29,517
Johnny, tell your dad
he's a great man.

00:00:29,517 --> 00:00:32,511
[ Voice breaking ]
I thank God

00:00:32,511 --> 00:00:33,520
that I got to work
with that man.

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,517
He's an innovator.

00:00:35,517 --> 00:00:36,525
He taught me
everything I know.

00:00:36,525 --> 00:00:38,531
Narrator:
If the sharks hear a great idea,

00:00:38,531 --> 00:00:41,528
they're ready to invest
using their own money.

00:00:41,528 --> 00:00:43,513
I'll give you the $400k.

00:00:43,513 --> 00:00:44,530
I'm gonna make you
the same offer.

00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:45,535
Silence, please.

00:00:45,535 --> 00:00:47,511
Truth is,
you built a brand.

00:00:47,511 --> 00:00:48,514
You know what you're doing.
We got a deal.

00:00:48,514 --> 00:00:50,521
Not that deal.
Not that deal?

00:00:50,521 --> 00:00:52,513
Oh, no.
O'Leary:
This is the shark tank.

00:00:52,513 --> 00:00:53,532
There's nothing else like it
on earth.

00:00:55,534 --> 00:00:57,515
Narrator:
Who are the sharks?

00:00:58,524 --> 00:01:01,531
They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors

00:01:01,531 --> 00:01:04,517
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.

00:01:04,517 --> 00:01:06,537
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist

00:01:06,537 --> 00:01:09,519
who turned a $10,000 loan

00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,537
into a software business
worth $4.2 billion.

00:01:14,528 --> 00:01:17,519
Mark Cuban, notorious
billionaire entrepreneur,

00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:18,531
tech guru,

00:01:18,531 --> 00:01:22,525
and the outspoken owner
of the NBA's Dallas mavericks.

00:01:23,534 --> 00:01:26,516
Lori Greiner, the queen of QVC,

00:01:26,516 --> 00:01:30,517
holds over 100 patents and
has launched over 300 products,

00:01:30,517 --> 00:01:33,528
grossing over a half a billion
dollars in retail sales.

00:01:33,528 --> 00:01:36,512
Daymond John is
a fashion and branding expert

00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,513
who grew
his homemade clothing line

00:01:38,513 --> 00:01:41,520
into the globally recognized
fashion brand fubu,

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,531
with over $6 billion
in retail sales to date.

00:01:44,531 --> 00:01:46,521
John Paul DeJoria

00:01:46,521 --> 00:01:48,532
is a prolific philanthropist
and entrepreneur

00:01:48,532 --> 00:01:50,532
behind widely known
luxury brands

00:01:50,532 --> 00:01:52,934
such as Paul Mitchell
and Patron.

00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:05,066
First into the tank
are best friends from St. Louis,

00:02:05,066 --> 00:02:09,064
with what they believe are
better, safer cleaning products.

00:02:15,045 --> 00:02:17,062
Hello, sharks.
My name's Kevin Tibbs.

00:02:17,062 --> 00:02:19,051
And I'm Tim Barklage.

00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:20,061
We're the founders
of better life,

00:02:20,061 --> 00:02:22,064
and we're requesting
$400,000

00:02:22,064 --> 00:02:25,056
in exchange for 7% equity stake
in our company.

00:02:25,056 --> 00:02:26,063
[ Chuckles ]

00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:29,052
Better life is a unique
line of cleaning products

00:02:29,052 --> 00:02:31,069
that will revolutionize

00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:33,046
the way people
think about cleaning.

00:02:33,046 --> 00:02:35,053
Our products are natural,
they're safe,

00:02:35,053 --> 00:02:37,065
and they work better than
the chemical cleaning products

00:02:37,065 --> 00:02:38,467
on the market today.

00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:40,300
Tim and I both have
young kids the same ages.

00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,292
When our kids started
crawling around the floor

00:02:42,292 --> 00:02:43,308
and putting everything
into their mouths,

00:02:43,308 --> 00:02:45,284
we really became concerned

00:02:45,284 --> 00:02:46,305
about the products
we had in our home.

00:02:46,305 --> 00:02:49,302
And with Kevin being
a formulation chemist,
I put him to the challenge

00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:52,295
to create something
that was safe and effective.

00:02:52,295 --> 00:02:55,285
Tim and I are gonna show you
just how well they work.

00:02:55,285 --> 00:02:57,300
You think soap scum
and hard water stains are tough?

00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,297
This is spray paint
on this tile right here.

00:03:00,297 --> 00:03:03,296
All right, we're gonna put
some of our cleaning product.

00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:06,282
And this product --
it's a cream scrub.

00:03:06,282 --> 00:03:07,298
No harsh chemicals.

00:03:07,298 --> 00:03:10,291
There are no fumes
to this product.

00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,304
And it's
completely safe.

00:03:11,304 --> 00:03:14,306
You don't need gloves,
gas masks, anything like that.

00:03:14,306 --> 00:03:17,301
Now, that's from
a plant-based product.

00:03:17,301 --> 00:03:19,284
This is what
we're talking about.

00:03:19,284 --> 00:03:20,295
Unbelievable cleaning.

00:03:20,295 --> 00:03:23,280
Now, this is
really impressive.

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,297
This is
a head-to-head competition

00:03:25,297 --> 00:03:29,303
against a national leading-brand
chemical disinfectant.

00:03:29,303 --> 00:03:32,295
First thing we're going to do
is take raw chicken,

00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:35,288
and we're going to spread it
across this piece of countertop.

00:03:35,288 --> 00:03:37,286
Stop the madness.
[ Laughs ]

00:03:37,286 --> 00:03:39,293
Now, I'm going to
swab that surface

00:03:39,293 --> 00:03:41,285
and put it
in this meter,

00:03:41,285 --> 00:03:43,300
and this is going to show us
what's left behind.

00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,293
Any reading over 200
is a dirty surface.

00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:51,285
And we get 8,840.

00:03:51,285 --> 00:03:54,280
So, as you might imagine --
we've got raw chicken here --

00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,309
this is
a very dirty surface.

00:03:55,309 --> 00:03:58,282
Now,
Tim is going to take

00:03:58,282 --> 00:04:00,297
this leading-brand
chemical cleaner,

00:04:00,297 --> 00:04:01,306
which is a disinfectant.

00:04:01,306 --> 00:04:03,306
Now, I'm going to do
the same thing.

00:04:03,306 --> 00:04:05,304
I'm going
to swab that side.

00:04:07,295 --> 00:04:10,280
And we get a reading
of 433.

00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,285
Oh, God.
Now I want Tim to clean
this side of the countertop

00:04:14,285 --> 00:04:17,288
with our
What-ever! Cleaner.

00:04:17,288 --> 00:04:18,289
All natural.

00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:19,307
There are no fumes
in this product.

00:04:19,307 --> 00:04:22,292
I'm going
to swab that surface.

00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,287
44.

00:04:27,287 --> 00:04:28,305
And the funny thing
I want to point out here

00:04:28,305 --> 00:04:30,296
is on this product,

00:04:30,296 --> 00:04:33,289
it is covered
with warning statements.

00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:34,306
It even says on the back

00:04:34,306 --> 00:04:36,291
that you need to wash
with soap and water

00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,294
after you've used
this product.

00:04:38,294 --> 00:04:39,308
It's a cleaning product.

00:04:39,308 --> 00:04:41,299
I want to point out
one thing.

00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:44,293
Not only
do we do a better job,

00:04:44,293 --> 00:04:46,302
but these products
are safe.

00:04:46,302 --> 00:04:48,282
How safe, you ask?

00:04:50,287 --> 00:04:51,304
That safe.

00:04:51,304 --> 00:04:55,281
Sharks, who wants to help us
create a better life?

00:04:55,281 --> 00:04:56,308
How long have you been
selling those products?

00:04:56,308 --> 00:04:58,305
We launched
about four --

00:04:58,305 --> 00:05:00,292
a little over
four years ago.

00:05:00,292 --> 00:05:02,281
And how much have you sold
last year?

00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:03,304
In the last 12 months,
we've done about

00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:06,301
$2.1 million in sales.
Greiner:
Oh, wow. [ Laughs ]

00:05:06,301 --> 00:05:10,282
Really? And who do you
sell it to, please?

00:05:10,282 --> 00:05:12,283
One of our biggest customers
is Whole Foods,

00:05:12,283 --> 00:05:14,304
regional grocery chains
across the country,

00:05:14,304 --> 00:05:16,289
places like Crate and Barrel,
as well.

00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:17,304
Sure.
What do you sell it for?

00:05:17,304 --> 00:05:19,297
$5.99 to $6.99.

00:05:19,297 --> 00:05:20,305
Can I look at it?

00:05:20,305 --> 00:05:21,304
Please.

00:05:21,304 --> 00:05:22,307
DeJoria:
What is your net?

00:05:22,307 --> 00:05:26,290
Yeah, last year we made
$115,000 pre-tax.

00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,294
Pre-tax.
$115,000.
So, your net's about 5%.

00:05:29,294 --> 00:05:31,297
A little more than that.

00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:32,307
Why are you
netting so little?

00:05:32,307 --> 00:05:34,308
Yeah.
Well, it's actually 7%,

00:05:34,308 --> 00:05:37,296
but we're dumping everything
into our brand.

00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:39,303
We have very, very little
that --

00:05:39,303 --> 00:05:42,288
is there anything proprietary
about your formulation?

00:05:42,288 --> 00:05:44,280
There is.
But the reality is --

00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,283
J.P., can't you
do a chemical report on it,

00:05:46,283 --> 00:05:47,300
easily,
to get the formula?
Yeah.

00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,283
They can, but I've been
a formulation chemist

00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,307
for 15 years,
and I can tell you

00:05:52,307 --> 00:05:56,284
that reverse engineering
is not so easy.

00:05:56,284 --> 00:05:59,280
John: Cash-flow positive,
so the question's going to be...
Correct.

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,284
...what do you
need our money for?

00:06:01,284 --> 00:06:03,299
Well, we are financially
very healthy,

00:06:03,299 --> 00:06:07,305
but we're not simply looking for
a financial partner.

00:06:07,305 --> 00:06:09,307
We're looking for
a strategic partner.

00:06:09,307 --> 00:06:12,307
And do you think that
any one of us want to
get out of bed for 7%?

00:06:15,296 --> 00:06:18,304
In your space,
the all-natural, non-chemical,

00:06:18,304 --> 00:06:21,294
are you the largest player
or is there somebody larger?

00:06:21,294 --> 00:06:24,299
I don't know
that there are any.

00:06:24,299 --> 00:06:26,283
You're the only guy
that can spray it in your mouth

00:06:26,283 --> 00:06:27,295
and then clean the walls
with it?

00:06:27,295 --> 00:06:30,299
Well, that won't go
into the hospital. [ Chuckles ]

00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:32,304
Greiner: I like you.
You're fantastic.

00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:34,296
I'm going to make you
an offer.

00:06:34,296 --> 00:06:38,290
Because I am the queen
of lightning speed
into all retail.

00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,307
My offer is going to be

00:06:40,307 --> 00:06:44,294
$400,000 for 17%,

00:06:44,294 --> 00:06:47,295
and I have
a direct-door policy

00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,297
right into
bed bath &amp; beyond,

00:06:49,297 --> 00:06:51,307
and I also think that QVC

00:06:51,307 --> 00:06:55,281
would be a great place
to put the product, as well.

00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:58,296
I would never do that deal.
17% is insane.
That's -- that's one store
that you know --

00:06:58,296 --> 00:07:00,301
well, I'm just gonna tell you
a little story.
That's never gonna happen.
That's pointless. Pointless.

00:07:00,301 --> 00:07:02,304
You know my little
scrub daddy sponge?

00:07:02,304 --> 00:07:04,283
I've heard of that.

00:07:04,283 --> 00:07:07,308
We, in 8 months,
have hit $13 million in sales.

00:07:07,308 --> 00:07:09,309
Wow.
Congratulations.

00:07:09,309 --> 00:07:12,296
Our partnership did that,
and I can do that for you.

00:07:12,296 --> 00:07:15,284
I saw the greed
here with Lori,

00:07:15,284 --> 00:07:17,297
and I'm really ashamed
that she would do
that to you here.

00:07:17,297 --> 00:07:18,305
Here's how I'll fix this
for you.

00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:22,282
I'll give you a loan,
which doesn't cost you anything.

00:07:22,282 --> 00:07:24,292
It's a loan, all right?

00:07:24,292 --> 00:07:26,301
It's $400,000
for 3 years.

00:07:26,301 --> 00:07:28,300
It has 10% interest on it,

00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,280
and I want
my equity of 5%.

00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,290
All right?

00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,287
Anybody
can give you money...
Bec-because...

00:07:35,287 --> 00:07:37,300
...but they can't
get you into retail.
...because I am
your banker.

00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,291
Not anybody --
I'm Mr. wonderful.

00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,307
Who can't
get you into retail.
At the end of the day --

00:07:41,307 --> 00:07:44,285
at the end of the day,
respects your equity,
as Lori doesn't.

00:07:44,285 --> 00:07:46,297
Mine is
12% less expensive.

00:07:46,297 --> 00:07:48,304
'Cause I believe
you'll pay back my loan.

00:07:48,304 --> 00:07:50,294
You got
a $2-million order tomorrow

00:07:50,294 --> 00:07:52,283
from a very large retailer.

00:07:52,283 --> 00:07:54,281
You're gonna roll it out
to 80% of their stores.

00:07:54,281 --> 00:07:55,295
How are you gonna
fund that?

00:07:55,295 --> 00:07:57,287
Well, loans.

00:07:57,287 --> 00:07:58,302
Right here.
They're gonna fund it

00:07:58,302 --> 00:07:59,309
because they're gonna
do the deal with me.
Right here.

00:07:59,309 --> 00:08:03,281
I have made more millionaires
here in the tank

00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:06,285
in less than a year
with my deals.

00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:09,281
I'm certain that
I will make you a millionaire.

00:08:10,304 --> 00:08:12,302
DeJoria:
I have an idea, okay?

00:08:12,302 --> 00:08:15,301
What you may not know, besides
the brands that I started,

00:08:15,301 --> 00:08:18,283
I also, uh,
am the major shareholder

00:08:18,283 --> 00:08:20,305
of John Paul Selects --
we're global.

00:08:20,305 --> 00:08:22,302
Not only do we sell it
over the Internet,

00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:25,287
but also we have direct
distribution to major stores

00:08:25,287 --> 00:08:26,305
throughout different
parts of the world.

00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:31,289
Now, for that $400,000,
if you will go 20%,

00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:34,284
if Lori's all for it,
I'll split with her 50/50.
Greiner: Sure.

00:08:34,284 --> 00:08:36,292
You've got two people
in that industry.

00:08:36,292 --> 00:08:39,296
The only concern is,
though, that that's
valuing the company

00:08:39,296 --> 00:08:42,302
at less than
our current sales.

00:08:42,302 --> 00:08:43,306
But you -- you have --
ding, ding, ding.

00:08:43,306 --> 00:08:45,286
O'Leary: What did you guys
just learn?

00:08:45,286 --> 00:08:47,289
Now you have
 two greedy pigs.

00:08:47,289 --> 00:08:49,281
[ Laughter ]
Not one.

00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:51,307
What if I give you
$500,000 for 20%?

00:08:51,307 --> 00:08:54,287
And Mark is staying quiet,
so hopefully

00:08:54,287 --> 00:08:56,304
he'll keep his pie hole shut
and we can do a deal.
What about --
what about something --

00:08:56,304 --> 00:09:01,280
what about something
more in the range of
$500,000 for 10%?

00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,298
$5-million valuation.
Whew.

00:09:04,298 --> 00:09:06,294
I mean, we're --
we're sweetening the pot here.

00:09:06,294 --> 00:09:09,284
But you also
want us to work for you,

00:09:09,284 --> 00:09:10,309
and you're not
valuing that.

00:09:10,309 --> 00:09:13,290
That's --
I mean, our --

00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,292
we're going to be
at $3 million.

00:09:15,292 --> 00:09:16,304
Right, we --
we believe in you.

00:09:16,304 --> 00:09:19,300
But I think you have
three offers on the table.

00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,289
Well --

00:09:21,289 --> 00:09:23,285
all the companies we
invest in, regardless
of which shark,

00:09:23,285 --> 00:09:25,292
get an immediate trajectory
out of the gate.

00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:27,308
You have to give up something
for that, my friend,

00:09:27,308 --> 00:09:29,282
no matter who you go with.

00:09:29,282 --> 00:09:30,295
This is the shark tank.

00:09:30,295 --> 00:09:32,286
There's nothing else like it
on earth.

00:09:43,285 --> 00:09:45,293
Narrator: Kevin and Tim
have three offers.

00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:49,288
J.P. And Lori have offered
$400,000 for 20%,

00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:53,296
Kevin has offered
a $400,000 loan for 5% equity,

00:09:53,296 --> 00:09:56,296
and Daymond has offered
$500,000 for 20%.

00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:57,308
What are you gonna do?

00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,297
Greiner: Listen, guys.
Here's the thing.

00:10:05,297 --> 00:10:08,283
J.P. and I
have revised our offer.

00:10:08,283 --> 00:10:12,296
It's $400,000 for 17%.

00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:18,293
We already know
when you talked to Mr. Wonderful

00:10:18,293 --> 00:10:20,293
that you don't want
just money.

00:10:20,293 --> 00:10:24,282
You want strategic
partners that will
take you to the top.

00:10:24,282 --> 00:10:27,284
Now close your eyes
and think about it.
[ Laughs ]

00:10:27,284 --> 00:10:28,302
You got a good product,
works really great,

00:10:28,302 --> 00:10:30,294
but you're gonna have
a lot of competition.

00:10:30,294 --> 00:10:32,304
It's not just
a clear-cut deal, guys.

00:10:32,304 --> 00:10:35,295
O'Leary: So, basically,
what Lori just said
and J.P. confirmed,

00:10:35,295 --> 00:10:37,294
"close your eyes
and let me screw you."

00:10:37,294 --> 00:10:40,285
That's basically
what happened.
[ Laughter ]

00:10:40,285 --> 00:10:42,288
Barklage: I think --
I think all the offers

00:10:42,288 --> 00:10:43,309
are very generous.

00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,295
We -- we haven't
heard from mark yet,

00:10:45,295 --> 00:10:47,283
and we would like
to hear from him,

00:10:47,283 --> 00:10:48,301
just out of respect
to everybody.

00:10:48,301 --> 00:10:50,303
Mark, tell them
what you're thinking.

00:10:50,303 --> 00:10:52,309
Cuban:
I'm willing to do $800k

00:10:52,309 --> 00:10:54,305
for the 20%.

00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,308
But what I'd like to do
is see Lori come in,

00:10:58,308 --> 00:11:02,284
because I think
Lori and QVC is the hero.

00:11:02,284 --> 00:11:03,290
That's why
I like to work with Lori.

00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,300
So --
so, is J.P. In the deal?

00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,303
No, just Lori and I.

00:11:08,286 --> 00:11:12,282
If Lori wants to,
where it's $800k against 20%.

00:11:13,294 --> 00:11:16,900
I think giving them $800,000
is too high.

00:11:18,281 --> 00:11:21,533
I'm gonna
throw you a lifeline here.

00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:23,526
You -- you obviously
don't want to take a loan,

00:11:23,526 --> 00:11:25,515
so I'm gonna
change my deal.

00:11:25,515 --> 00:11:28,534
I'll give you
the $400k for 17%.

00:11:28,534 --> 00:11:31,508
That's what I said.
I want to --
silence, please.

00:11:31,508 --> 00:11:32,517
I'm making an offer.
[ Chuckles ]

00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:34,525
I'll give you
the $400k for 17%.

00:11:34,525 --> 00:11:36,525
After you pay me back
my $400,000

00:11:36,525 --> 00:11:38,531
at any schedule you want,

00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:42,529
you take back 10% of the equity
back to yourself.

00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:44,522
Very interesting.

00:11:44,522 --> 00:11:46,512
I'm gonna make you
the same offer.

00:11:46,512 --> 00:11:47,531
So, there's no interest?

00:11:47,531 --> 00:11:48,535
There's no originality,
either.

00:11:48,535 --> 00:11:51,516
[ Laughter ]

00:11:51,516 --> 00:11:53,535
Since Lori, you know,

00:11:53,535 --> 00:11:56,518
ran over J.P.
Like a scurvy dog,

00:11:56,518 --> 00:11:58,521
yeah, I'm --
I think that --

00:11:58,521 --> 00:12:01,524
I think that if --
J.P., if you want to
do something together,

00:12:01,524 --> 00:12:03,523
because I think
they shouldn't ignore somebody

00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:06,514
who's been selling products
and chemicals for years...

00:12:07,528 --> 00:12:10,511
If you want to come
in half with me on
that, we'll do it.

00:12:10,511 --> 00:12:12,510
$500,000 for 20%.

00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,532
That's expensive.
I don't like it.

00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:15,525
Yeah, I would do that
with you.
Okay.

00:12:15,525 --> 00:12:16,531
Yeah, I would do that
with you.
All right.

00:12:19,515 --> 00:12:22,534
I would love to
hear an offer

00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:26,520
from Mark, from Lori,

00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,514
that looks something like
$500,000 for 10%.

00:12:33,532 --> 00:12:36,523
As much as I love
partnering with Mark,

00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:40,514
I have to say on this one,
I don't need him.

00:12:40,514 --> 00:12:41,529
And, besides,
the amount of work

00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:44,520
that I know
I will have to put in --

00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,518
I want to go lightning-fast.

00:12:46,518 --> 00:12:49,000
Mm-hmm.
So, I like the offer
that I gave you.

00:12:50,133 --> 00:12:52,333
Cuban: I'd like to do
this with a strategic
partner like Lori,

00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:53,337
but that's not gonna
happen.

00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:55,342
I'm out.

00:12:56,354 --> 00:12:59,352
You know,
this is a defining moment.

00:12:59,352 --> 00:13:02,346
So, think carefully,
'cause you don't want

00:13:02,346 --> 00:13:05,349
to walk out of here
having an "oh, no" moment.

00:13:05,349 --> 00:13:07,354
"Oh, no.
What did I just do?

00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:09,348
What did I just lose?"

00:13:09,348 --> 00:13:11,352
Narrator: Lori and Kevin
have the same offer --

00:13:11,352 --> 00:13:14,357
a $400,000 loan for 17% equity

00:13:14,357 --> 00:13:17,361
that drops to 7%
when the loan is paid back.

00:13:17,361 --> 00:13:20,337
Daymond and John Paul
teamed up

00:13:20,337 --> 00:13:24,332
to offer $500,000
for a 20% stake.

00:13:24,332 --> 00:13:25,343
All the offers
are on the table.

00:13:25,343 --> 00:13:27,033
What are you gonna do?

00:13:33,336 --> 00:13:35,336
Would you like to?

00:13:35,336 --> 00:13:36,361
Lori, let's do it.

00:13:36,361 --> 00:13:39,351
Yay! Great.

00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:41,357
It's gonna be awesome.

00:13:41,357 --> 00:13:42,360
[ Chuckles ]
Thank you.

00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,233
Congratulations.
Thank you.

00:13:47,355 --> 00:13:50,867
Better life
is going to be a household name.

00:13:50,867 --> 00:13:54,400
Lori will get us there
so much faster.

00:14:02,861 --> 00:14:03,873
Narrator: In season 4,

00:14:03,873 --> 00:14:05,874
Nicole Townend made a deal
with Mark Cuban

00:14:05,874 --> 00:14:08,857
for her stuffed animal laundry
bag company,

00:14:08,857 --> 00:14:09,870
Teddy needs a bath.

00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,881
Done, done, and done.

00:14:10,881 --> 00:14:12,865
Whoo!
[ Laughter ]

00:14:12,865 --> 00:14:14,859
Narrator:
Let's see how she's doing now.

00:14:14,859 --> 00:14:16,868
Townend: Although it was
terrifying going in the tank,

00:14:16,868 --> 00:14:18,860
it was the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,875
For the first time,
my product is gonna be available

00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,860
at a major retailer.

00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,858
Oh, my gosh.

00:14:24,858 --> 00:14:25,881
Babies "R" Us
has signed on to carry us

00:14:25,881 --> 00:14:27,879
in 450 stores nationwide.

00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:28,883
So cool.

00:14:28,883 --> 00:14:31,863
Before "shark tank,"
we had $12,000 in sales.

00:14:31,863 --> 00:14:34,862
Since "shark tank,"
we have over $100,000 in sales

00:14:34,862 --> 00:14:36,881
and we're on track
to hit our first $1 million

00:14:36,881 --> 00:14:39,860
over the next 12 months.

00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,863
I have just signed with gund,

00:14:41,863 --> 00:14:43,880
the oldest existing
Teddy-bear company in the world.

00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,870
So many people
contact gund all the time

00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,883
to ask us how do we
wash our Teddy bears,

00:14:47,883 --> 00:14:49,874
and your invention
is genius.

00:14:49,874 --> 00:14:52,865
They are taking over all the
manufacturing and distribution,

00:14:52,865 --> 00:14:54,858
which allows me
to be in charge of creative,

00:14:54,858 --> 00:14:55,882
which is what I enjoy
the most.

00:14:55,882 --> 00:14:57,882
Behind it.
Okay, that's great.

00:14:57,882 --> 00:15:00,872
The reason I started
this company in the first place

00:15:00,872 --> 00:15:03,855
was to be able to stay at home
with my daughter.

00:15:03,855 --> 00:15:05,866
I used to spend endless days
behind a desk.

00:15:05,866 --> 00:15:07,858
Now thanks
to this licensing deal,

00:15:07,858 --> 00:15:09,864
I've been able to move my family
to Hawaii,

00:15:09,864 --> 00:15:11,871
and now I spend my days
hunting seashells

00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,567
with my daughter
on beautiful beaches.

00:15:14,567 --> 00:15:16,563
"Shark tank" has made
all of my dreams come true.

00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,100
Narrator:
Next into the tank

00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,099
is a 24-year-old entrepreneur
from New York City

00:15:26,099 --> 00:15:29,095
with an update
of a classic party favorite.

00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,090
Hi, my name
is Solomon Fallas,

00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:40,108
and my product is the amazing
and versatile 180cup.

00:15:40,108 --> 00:15:43,106
I am here seeking
a $300,000 investment

00:15:43,106 --> 00:15:47,089
in exchange for
a 15% stake in my company.

00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:48,107
Now, we're all familiar with

00:15:48,107 --> 00:15:51,080
this simple, red,
disposable cup.

00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,667
It continues to be
a prominent icon,

00:15:52,667 --> 00:15:54,664
so much so
that in the United States alone,

00:15:54,664 --> 00:15:57,655
there are over 2 billion
of these used each year.

00:15:57,655 --> 00:16:00,665
I have revolutionized
and made this cup better.

00:16:00,665 --> 00:16:02,666
My product, 180cup --

00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:05,646
it is a fundamental drinking cup
when right-side up,

00:16:05,646 --> 00:16:09,645
and when flipped 180 degrees,
it acts as a shot glass

00:16:09,645 --> 00:16:12,642
or a container
or even a measuring cup.

00:16:12,642 --> 00:16:13,666
Shoot it,

00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,649
flip it,

00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:16,661
or drink it.

00:16:16,661 --> 00:16:18,000
With its dual function,

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,012
it's a lot more attractive
than the standard red cup.

00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:23,002
Let's say you're at a barbecue
or even a sporting event.

00:16:23,002 --> 00:16:24,991
You grab a hot dog
and some fries.

00:16:24,991 --> 00:16:26,999
You want some ketchup for
those fries without the mess?

00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:28,008
No problem.

00:16:28,008 --> 00:16:30,008
With the 180cup,
simply flip it over,

00:16:30,008 --> 00:16:32,998
and you have a perfectly
constructed, neat container,

00:16:32,998 --> 00:16:35,003
perfect for any of your sauces.

00:16:35,003 --> 00:16:36,999
180cup is a clear-cut winner

00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:39,998
and soon to be a staple
at every barbecue, tailgate,

00:16:39,998 --> 00:16:41,994
birthday party, bar mitzvah.

00:16:41,994 --> 00:16:44,008
You name it, 180cup is there.

00:16:44,008 --> 00:16:46,995
So, who wants to
take a shot with me?

00:16:46,995 --> 00:16:48,006
Greiner: [ Chuckles ]

00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:50,016
Have you sold any?
Yes.

00:16:50,016 --> 00:16:54,002
In under 6 months, we've sold
over 5 million 180cups...

00:16:54,002 --> 00:16:55,999
Whoa!
DeJoria: Wow.

00:16:55,999 --> 00:16:58,998
...generating
$385,000 in sales.

00:17:00,014 --> 00:17:01,999
Where did you sell them?

00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:04,000
We're in 570 stores
to date.

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,018
Most of our income
is from local mom-and-pop shops

00:17:06,018 --> 00:17:08,991
located
around college campuses.

00:17:08,991 --> 00:17:10,006
So, you went
to trade shows

00:17:10,006 --> 00:17:12,001
and then, like, sold them
to these mom-and-pops or --

00:17:12,001 --> 00:17:15,011
no, actually, I took
a very unique approach
to selling these.

00:17:15,011 --> 00:17:17,995
Through my social networks
and craigslist,

00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,003
we offered collegians
an opportunity to make money.

00:17:20,003 --> 00:17:21,012
All they would have to do
is connect us

00:17:21,012 --> 00:17:23,996
with their local liquor,
convenience, or grocery store.

00:17:23,996 --> 00:17:26,007
We'd send them free
samples. If they sold,
they'd place an order.

00:17:26,007 --> 00:17:27,009
Depending on that order,

00:17:27,009 --> 00:17:29,020
we'd give the collegians
a commission.

00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:32,994
Using that process,
we broke 120 stores.

00:17:32,994 --> 00:17:36,009
We've received a 92%
reorder rate from those stores.

00:17:36,009 --> 00:17:38,001
So, how long have you
been in business?

00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:40,016
Six months.
Wow.

00:17:40,016 --> 00:17:42,006
Can I see
one of the cups?
Of course.

00:17:43,015 --> 00:17:46,007
Check them out.
They're really cool.

00:17:46,007 --> 00:17:49,993
These are our 24 pack.

00:17:49,993 --> 00:17:51,992
And we're right there
at the same price

00:17:51,992 --> 00:17:53,006
as a standard red cup.

00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:55,994
That is the beautiful thing
about this product.

00:17:55,994 --> 00:17:57,011
How'd you
come up with this idea?

00:17:57,011 --> 00:17:59,008
Went to go visit
my brother in college.

00:17:59,008 --> 00:18:01,010
He was hosting
a party for his fraternity.

00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,992
I personally
didn't go to college,

00:18:02,992 --> 00:18:05,010
so I walked in and
I was just immediately in shock.

00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:08,008
I counted 900 cups.
There must have been
200 people there.

00:18:08,008 --> 00:18:10,020
His friend drops a
shot of whiskey in the
drink and it hit me.

00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,002
I said,
"these cups are everywhere.

00:18:12,002 --> 00:18:13,995
"Someone's making
a ton of money off this.

00:18:13,995 --> 00:18:16,013
Why not apply this process
to the red cup?"

00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:18,994
John: Well, what --
what -- what about this?

00:18:18,994 --> 00:18:21,600
$300,000 for 20% --
you give me the
answer right now.

00:18:23,005 --> 00:18:24,013
Oh, wow.

00:18:24,013 --> 00:18:27,003
[ Sighs ]

00:18:27,003 --> 00:18:28,999
O'Leary:
Well, you know...
You should say yes.

00:18:28,999 --> 00:18:30,018
...I still have a couple
of questions before
I make him an offer.

00:18:30,018 --> 00:18:32,005
I'm gonna pull it
off the table in a second.

00:18:32,005 --> 00:18:34,734
$300,000, 20% right now.

00:18:34,734 --> 00:18:35,738
[ Sighs ]

00:18:35,738 --> 00:18:36,739
Ooh.

00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,738
Narrator: Solomon is seeking
$300,000 for 15% of his company,

00:18:49,738 --> 00:18:52,725
but Daymond shocked everyone

00:18:52,725 --> 00:18:54,741
by immediately offering
$300,000 for 20%,

00:18:54,741 --> 00:18:57,717
which lowered his valuation
from $2 million

00:18:57,717 --> 00:18:59,734
to $1.5 million.

00:18:59,734 --> 00:19:01,718
O'Leary:
Well, you know...
Cuban: You should say yes.

00:19:01,718 --> 00:19:03,726
...I still have a couple
of questions before
I make him an offer.

00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:07,722
I'm gonna pull it off
the table in a second.
$300,000, 20% right now.

00:19:07,722 --> 00:19:08,729
[ Sighs ]

00:19:08,729 --> 00:19:10,726
Well, you don't know
if there's a better offer.

00:19:14,716 --> 00:19:15,736
[ Sighs ]

00:19:15,736 --> 00:19:18,721
Can I finish
the rest of my information?
[ Laughing ] Oh, man!

00:19:18,721 --> 00:19:20,715
I want -- I want you to know
how big this can get.
It's getting --
it's gonna -- okay.

00:19:20,715 --> 00:19:22,717
If you saw a $100 bill on
the ground, would you
stop and pick it up

00:19:22,717 --> 00:19:24,717
or would you look to
see if there's more
down the street?

00:19:24,717 --> 00:19:26,730
Don't let a guy
railroad you on a deal.

00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,725
You don't know
if there's another offer here.

00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,724
Right, I'd like
to hear other offers.

00:19:34,724 --> 00:19:35,735
Oh, man!
Yeah, no kidding.

00:19:35,735 --> 00:19:37,739
Okay.
With all due respect,

00:19:37,739 --> 00:19:39,726
I love the offer
and it's a great offer.

00:19:39,726 --> 00:19:40,739
I just would love
to hear other offers.

00:19:40,739 --> 00:19:42,742
Oh, man.
You gave me time
to think, then,

00:19:42,742 --> 00:19:44,743
so, then,
I guess I have to be out.

00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,720
Wow.

00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,739
DeJoria:
Is this patented?
Yes.

00:19:54,739 --> 00:19:57,720
It's it patent-pending,
or is it patented?
This is
a fully patented product.

00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,726
We have a utility patent
and a design patent.

00:19:59,726 --> 00:20:01,729
Greiner:
So, your market

00:20:01,729 --> 00:20:03,728
is college students,
predominantly,

00:20:03,728 --> 00:20:04,743
because that's
who's interested in

00:20:04,743 --> 00:20:07,724
having shots and beers
constantly.

00:20:07,724 --> 00:20:08,740
Speak for yourself.
[ Laughs ]

00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,732
Well, I-I'd say yes and no,

00:20:10,732 --> 00:20:12,729
because
at the end of the day,

00:20:12,729 --> 00:20:14,729
where don't you find
the red plastic cup?

00:20:14,729 --> 00:20:17,721
How much of your own
money have you put
in this so far?

00:20:17,721 --> 00:20:19,729
$175,000.
Cuban: Oh!

00:20:19,729 --> 00:20:20,733
Whoa!

00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:22,733
I'm more curious
about your college network.

00:20:22,733 --> 00:20:24,721
How many people?
How many campuses?

00:20:24,721 --> 00:20:26,716
Are they continuing
to sell for you?

00:20:26,716 --> 00:20:27,732
Can you put other products
through there?

00:20:27,732 --> 00:20:29,722
Yes, definitely.

00:20:29,722 --> 00:20:31,724
Currently, we're in
120 stores, over 30 colleges.

00:20:31,724 --> 00:20:32,739
There's 3,000 colleges.

00:20:32,739 --> 00:20:35,715
There's 6 1/2 million kids
in college.

00:20:35,715 --> 00:20:37,726
So, we're basically covering
1% of the market,

00:20:37,726 --> 00:20:40,726
and we've generated
$385,000 in sales.

00:20:40,726 --> 00:20:42,716
You know, college kids
interact with each other

00:20:42,716 --> 00:20:43,734
and with more people
than anyone else.

00:20:43,734 --> 00:20:45,730
A friend in Seattle is gonna
tell his friend in New York.

00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:48,730
I want to build a brand.
So, some dude's walking around
a fraternity party

00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,734
doing shots out of
this and that looks
cool, basically,

00:20:50,734 --> 00:20:52,741
or playing flip cup
or whatever.
Right.

00:20:52,741 --> 00:20:54,743
Because then all of a
sudden, you could start
putting logos on there.

00:20:54,743 --> 00:20:56,726
Happy you said that.

00:20:56,726 --> 00:20:58,723
See, we came out with these cups
in clear, as well.

00:20:58,723 --> 00:21:00,744
So, now, what I created
these clear cups for

00:21:00,744 --> 00:21:04,717
was to go after
these spirit companies.

00:21:04,717 --> 00:21:06,741
J.P., imagine if you could
send your customers these cups

00:21:06,741 --> 00:21:09,726
as a promotional item
with your logo on it.

00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,734
Not only are they gonna be
drinking your stuff,

00:21:11,734 --> 00:21:14,722
but your logo is gonna
be smack in the face
of your customer.

00:21:14,722 --> 00:21:16,743
John: I was already
there at the beginning,
because I understood that.

00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:20,736
These bobos usually
catch up to me about
10 minutes later, so...

00:21:20,736 --> 00:21:24,721
You know, now, we
understand what I was
already thinking, so...

00:21:24,721 --> 00:21:25,734
You guys
got any offers for him?

00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,715
There's something about,
like, doing a shot,

00:21:35,715 --> 00:21:37,742
putting it down on the dirty
table, doing a shot again.

00:21:37,742 --> 00:21:40,716
I don't know.
Cuban:
A lot of experience there?

00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,724
[ Laughs ]
Yeah.

00:21:43,724 --> 00:21:45,740
I-I understand what
you're saying, but the truth is,

00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,741
at the end of the day, it is
selling to the college market.

00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:51,735
I-I-I guess I'm not into
promoting something

00:21:51,735 --> 00:21:53,726
where people
are doing a lot of shots.

00:21:53,726 --> 00:21:55,719
But, Lori,
imagine you put this on QVC.

00:21:55,719 --> 00:21:57,726
Imagine
what people are gonna think.
I don't think
they'd want it.

00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:00,732
I have to be honest.

00:22:00,732 --> 00:22:02,733
This really isn't
my kind of thing,

00:22:02,733 --> 00:22:03,734
so I'm out.

00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:11,722
Look, what you set up
with the kids,

00:22:11,722 --> 00:22:12,732
to go out there
and become your sales reps,

00:22:12,732 --> 00:22:14,728
I think is brilliant,
right?

00:22:14,728 --> 00:22:16,742
You created
something interesting,

00:22:16,742 --> 00:22:18,741
but it's niche and
it doesn't match your valuation,

00:22:18,741 --> 00:22:20,716
so, for that reason,
I'm out.

00:22:20,716 --> 00:22:22,739
All right.

00:22:22,739 --> 00:22:25,737
DeJoria:
I personally think that

00:22:25,737 --> 00:22:27,736
what you are doing
as an entrepreneur is brilliant.

00:22:27,736 --> 00:22:31,723
You're thinking
out of the box.

00:22:31,723 --> 00:22:33,720
But I'm
the type of investor

00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,731
that really has to feel
the passion about something.

00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:37,737
If I don't feel it,
I can't really get into it,

00:22:37,737 --> 00:22:41,716
so, in this case,
I'm out.

00:22:41,716 --> 00:22:43,726
Okay.

00:22:43,726 --> 00:22:45,719
[ Sighs ]

00:22:45,719 --> 00:22:48,724
Kevin, it's making money.
That's what we both love.

00:22:48,724 --> 00:22:50,736
You know, the ketchup
and mustard thing,

00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:51,736
that's a load of crap.

00:22:51,736 --> 00:22:53,740
We both know that.

00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,723
This thing
is a bar deal,

00:22:56,723 --> 00:22:58,717
and I understand
you've got

00:22:58,717 --> 00:23:00,733
a very interesting way
of selling it.

00:23:00,733 --> 00:23:03,736
Uh...
I, uh -- I'm out.

00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:13,734
When I gave you
a hard offer immediately,

00:23:13,734 --> 00:23:16,743
you just
ignored that offer.

00:23:18,743 --> 00:23:20,732
My --
my feelings are hurt.

00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:23,731
Daymond, with all due respect,
it was just a little too early.

00:23:23,731 --> 00:23:25,729
I wa-- I just --
I need to treat this --

00:23:25,729 --> 00:23:27,724
I need to --
I need to be fair to myself.

00:23:31,719 --> 00:23:34,720
Now I become
a little bit more valuable

00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,729
because everybody else
fell out.

00:23:39,743 --> 00:23:42,727
Would you like
to make me feel better?

00:23:42,727 --> 00:23:44,723
Warm and toasty?

00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,729
And we can go
do shots together?
Truth is, you built a brand.

00:23:46,729 --> 00:23:48,719
You know what you're doing.
We got a deal.

00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,743
Not that deal.
Not that deal?

00:23:50,743 --> 00:23:53,731
Oh, no.
Too late.

00:23:53,731 --> 00:23:55,720
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

Hello, sharks,
my name is Jason Woods,

and my product
is the Kymera body board.

I'm seeking $250,000
for a 20% stake in my business.

00:25:47,724 --> 00:25:50,730
Now, for a shark, getting
out in the water is easy,

00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:53,720
but for the rest of us,
it can be a real hassle.

00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,743
A 10-foot stand-up paddleboard
may be light enough to carry,

00:25:55,743 --> 00:25:57,735
but it can be
a little boring to ride on.

00:25:57,735 --> 00:26:00,732
A jet ski, on the other hand,
can be a real blast to ride,

And where's the fun in that?

00:26:12,715 --> 00:26:13,731

The world's first all-electric
jet-propelled body board

00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,730
and one of the most versatile
watercraft ever built.

00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,743
Kymera combines the lightweight
and portability of a board

00:26:21,743 --> 00:26:25,733
with the excitement of a jet
to forever change the way
we experience the water.

and low center of gravity

for anyone to ride.

00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,738
Just pull the trigger
to control the speed

00:26:44,738 --> 00:26:46,729

in the direction you want to go.

I have a question.
Yeah.

00:27:13,728 --> 00:27:16,715
When you're on it, the way
that she was positioned,

00:27:16,715 --> 00:27:18,742
it looks to me awkward,
like it would hurt your neck.

00:27:18,742 --> 00:27:20,743
What you're not seeing
is the fact that in the water,

00:27:20,743 --> 00:27:22,733
your weight
is biased to the back.

00:27:22,733 --> 00:27:24,740
So the board
actually sits at a slight angle,

00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,715
and then the front of the board
is actually at a slight angle,

00:27:27,715 --> 00:27:28,726

to regulate the impact

00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:36,178
and she says, "you're
trespassing in my grove!"

00:38:36,178 --> 00:38:38,194
And I said, "yes,
ma'am, but I'm trying
to show you something.

00:38:38,194 --> 00:38:40,173
"It's getting ready to freeze.

00:38:40,173 --> 00:38:41,201
"We have the best
frost-protection device

00:38:41,201 --> 00:38:43,201
on the market
right here we could put on."

00:38:43,201 --> 00:38:45,189
And -- and she says,

00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:47,180
"you've got to go
or I'm calling the police."

00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,192
And I said, "yes, ma'am.
Here's my card. I'm sorry."

00:38:49,192 --> 00:38:51,176
You know,
because these are farmers.

00:38:51,176 --> 00:38:53,178
This is their land.
This is their livelihood.

00:38:53,178 --> 00:38:56,196
So, a week later, I get
a call from the same woman.

00:38:56,196 --> 00:38:59,173
"Hey, Johnny. This is Mrs..."

00:38:59,173 --> 00:39:00,191
I said, "yes, ma'am,"
she says,

00:39:00,191 --> 00:39:02,195
"I want to pay you
for them five t-pees."

00:39:02,195 --> 00:39:05,174
And I said, "yes, ma'am. That's
okay. Don't worry about it."

00:39:05,174 --> 00:39:08,178
She says, "well, I want you
to bring me 4,995 more.

00:39:08,178 --> 00:39:10,184
Wow.
"The only five trees
I got alive today...

00:39:10,184 --> 00:39:13,172
Wow.
...in my whole grove
is these."

00:39:13,172 --> 00:39:14,192
Is there anything like this
on the market?

00:39:14,192 --> 00:39:16,187
No, sir, there's no
water-containment system

00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,201
out there
for the micro-sprinklers.

00:39:19,176 --> 00:39:21,175
Why only $5?

00:39:21,175 --> 00:39:23,196
O'Leary: It's got to be $12.
Why not charge $10 or $12
or $15 or $20?

00:39:23,196 --> 00:39:25,179
Because
I'm working with farmers,

00:39:25,179 --> 00:39:27,180
and they're buying --
they're not buying one.

00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:30,197
They're buying
20,000, 7,000, 10,000. Sir?
But still, not why $10?

00:39:30,197 --> 00:39:34,186
Even -- even at 10,000, right,
why not $7?

00:39:34,186 --> 00:39:37,175
Well, I've never done that.
I've always tried to be right.

00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:38,193
I make $1 off each one.
If I --

00:39:38,193 --> 00:39:40,191
I sold 7,000 yesterday.
I made 7 grand.

00:39:40,191 --> 00:39:42,189
Johnny, you -- you could see
a partner that --

00:39:42,189 --> 00:39:45,180
let's say I was a big
distributor of water
irrigation systems,

00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,193
and I see this product
and you show it to me,

00:39:47,193 --> 00:39:49,197
and you make it
for $2.50

00:39:49,197 --> 00:39:51,195
and you sell it for $5,
right?

00:39:51,195 --> 00:39:54,188
I'm making it for $2.95.
I sell them for $4.50.
Yeah.

00:39:54,188 --> 00:39:57,191
Okay, so, I can't
get involved with you

00:39:57,191 --> 00:40:00,178
'cause there's not enough margin
for me as a distributor.

00:40:00,178 --> 00:40:03,190
I need to be able to sell it
for $12 at least

00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:06,178
so that I can
make some profit

00:40:06,178 --> 00:40:07,194
and you can
make some profit, right?

00:40:07,194 --> 00:40:08,200
'Cause I'm --
now we're --

00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,187
there's two of us.
Two mouths to feed.

00:40:10,187 --> 00:40:12,176
Yeah, but you're selling
to farmers.

00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:13,194
Okay, I get it,
but I'm exploring

00:40:13,194 --> 00:40:15,187
where your head's at,
all right?
Okay.

00:40:15,187 --> 00:40:17,176
That means that
there's no room in it

00:40:17,176 --> 00:40:20,173
for a distributor
that can really scale this up,

00:40:20,173 --> 00:40:21,185
'cause you said
every farmer should have it.

00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:22,195
Every farm in America that does
something should have this.

00:40:22,195 --> 00:40:24,181
Every tree
that goes in the ground

00:40:24,181 --> 00:40:26,180
should have a Tree-T-Pee on it.
But in order for
that to happen,

00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,198
I need a lot of Johnnys --
there's only one of you.

00:40:28,198 --> 00:40:31,173
I need like
2,000 Johnnys

00:40:31,173 --> 00:40:33,188
calling on farmers
all across the land.

00:40:33,188 --> 00:40:35,867
And who is gonna pay
them, Johnny? Who's
gonna pay them?

00:40:37,862 --> 00:40:38,866
I'm out.

00:40:44,873 --> 00:40:48,846
Johnny.
Yes, sir.

00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:50,861
Farmers are
the cornerstone of America.

00:40:50,861 --> 00:40:52,859
There may be
a lot of farmers out there

00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:54,872
that can't afford
$12 per tree,

00:40:54,872 --> 00:40:57,863
but maybe they could afford
$6 or $7.

00:40:57,863 --> 00:41:00,858
I'm gonna give you
everything you're asking for --

00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:02,871
your $150,000 for 20%.

00:41:02,871 --> 00:41:05,854
What you're doing
is right,

00:41:05,854 --> 00:41:07,855
and you deserve the chance
to make it big

00:41:07,855 --> 00:41:08,862
and do a lot of good.

00:41:08,862 --> 00:41:09,873
I'd like to be your partner,
Johnny.

00:41:09,873 --> 00:41:11,866
I like everything
you stand for, man,

00:41:11,866 --> 00:41:13,853
and I like everything.
Thank you, partner.

00:41:13,853 --> 00:41:15,850
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
I think that's
a yes, J.P.

00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:16,861
Yes, sir.
Okay, man.

00:41:16,861 --> 00:41:18,846
Good for you.
All right, partner.
Congratulations.

00:41:18,846 --> 00:41:19,865
God bless America.

00:41:19,865 --> 00:41:21,845
You show that it works,
man.
Thank you. Thank you.

00:41:21,845 --> 00:41:22,856
All right, dude.
All right.

00:41:22,856 --> 00:41:23,871
I appreciate it.
Well done, partner.

00:41:23,871 --> 00:41:25,846
I'll be a good one, too.
All right.

00:41:25,846 --> 00:41:27,860
I love that
you care about the farmer.

00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,851
Johnny, tell your dad
he's a great man.

00:41:30,851 --> 00:41:31,861
He died 12 years ago.
Ohh.

00:41:31,861 --> 00:41:33,851
He's still a great man.

00:41:33,851 --> 00:41:36,847
He made me who I --
[ sniffles ]

00:41:41,854 --> 00:41:44,869
[ Voice breaking ]
We work hard every day.

00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:47,873
I worked for that man
for 20 years.

00:41:47,873 --> 00:41:51,845
I thank God that
I got to work with that man.

00:41:51,845 --> 00:41:52,858
He's an innovator.

00:41:52,858 --> 00:41:54,849
He taught me
everything I know.

00:41:54,849 --> 00:41:57,855
He was hard on us,
but nobody owes you nothing.

00:41:57,855 --> 00:41:59,856
Life is what you make it.
He taught me that.

00:41:59,856 --> 00:42:01,873
And he was a great man.
He came from nothing.

00:42:01,873 --> 00:42:03,855
Cuban:
You're a star, Johnny.

00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:04,861
Man, congratulations.
Thank you.

00:42:04,861 --> 00:42:05,866
DeJoria: Superstar, dude.
God bless you, Johnny.

00:42:05,866 --> 00:42:07,858
Thank you.

00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,849
[ Sniffles ]

00:42:12,868 --> 00:42:15,859
Come here today
and go in front of the sharks.

00:42:15,859 --> 00:42:18,848
I didn't have a clue that it was
gonna be like that, you know?

00:42:18,848 --> 00:42:21,862
I'm going home with
a billionaire for
a business partner.

00:42:21,862 --> 00:42:23,857
It's all good, brother.
[ Laughs ]

00:42:23,857 --> 00:42:26,467
You know? I mean, it doesn't
get any better than that.
