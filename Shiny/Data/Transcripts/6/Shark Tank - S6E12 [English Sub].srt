00:00:01,401 --> 00:00:03,303
Narrator: BRING ON THE CHEER.
IT'S A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE!

00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:05,439
Narrator: IT'S A SPECIAL
HOLIDAY EPISODE OF "SHARK TANK."

00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:07,174
NAILED IT.

00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:09,343
HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THIS
IDEA? DID YOU HAVE A BAD DREAM?

00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:13,280
Narrator: IN THE TANK,

ENTREPRENEURS
SEEK AN INVESTMENT

00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:18,151

THEIR BUSINESS.

00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:20,120
IF I HAVE TO TAKE OUT
ANOTHER MORTGAGE ON MY HOUSE,

I WILL.

I HAVE RECHRISTENED YOU
"THE BEAST."

00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,491
Narrator: IF THE SHARKS HEAR
A GREAT IDEA,

00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:26,426
THEY'LL INVEST
THEIR OWN MONEY...

00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:29,062
WHAT YOU'VE DONE
IS AMAZING.

00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:31,031
...AND FIGHT EACH OTHER
FOR A DEAL.

00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,000
YOU HAVE A HISTORY
OF TAKING REAL CRAP

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,301
AND TURNING IT INTO GOLD.
[ LAUGHS ]

00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:37,237
Narrator: BUT THE ENTREPRENEURS
MUST GET THE FULL AMOUNT

00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:40,007
THEY'RE ASKING FOR, OR THEY'LL
WALK AWAY WITH NOTHING.

00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:41,275
I'M A CREATIVE MIND
ON CRACK.

00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:42,976
I THINK YOU HAVE
A LONG WAY TO GO.

00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:44,244
MAYBE YOU JUST SAVED YOURSELF
FROM DEATH.

00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:46,179
YOU GOT TO LEAVE
WITH A SHARK.

00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:48,315
LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO YOU,
MR. WONDERFUL.

00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:49,316

KEVIN O'LEARY IS

SELLING A CHILDREN'S
EDUCATIONAL COMPANY

00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:07,234
FOR OVER $4 BILLION.

FIRST INTO THE TANK
IS WHAT THE ENTREPRENEUR HOPES

00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:55,048
WILL BE A NEW ADDITION
TO AN ANCIENT TRADITION.

00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:02,122
HELLO, SHARKS.

00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,025
MY NAME'S NEAL HOFFMAN
FROM CINCINNATI, OHIO,

00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:09,162
AND I'M HERE ASKING FOR $150,000
FOR 10% OF MY COMPANY.

00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,367
NOW, SHARKS,
THINK ABOUT THE HOLIDAY SEASON.

00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:16,069
THE SMELL OF CHRISTMAS TREES
IS IN THE AIR,

00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,271
YOU HEAR "JINGLE BELLS"
PLAYING ON THE RADIO,

00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,440
AND YOU'RE LITERALLY
COUNTING DOWN THE DAYS

00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,242
UNTIL SANTA
COMES TO YOUR HOUSE.

00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,044
IT SOUNDS WONDERFUL,
DOESN'T IT?

00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:26,113
AND IT IS...

00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:28,949
UNLESS YOU'RE JEWISH.
[ CHUCKLES ]

00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:31,351
CHRISTMASTIME IS THE HARDEST
TIME TO BE A JEWISH CHILD.

00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:36,156
BUT JUST BECAUSE OUR RELIGION'S
OVER 5,000 YEARS OLD

00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,026
DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN'T ADD
SOME MORE "FUNUKKAH"

00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:40,027
TO HANUKKAH.

00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:42,429
INTRODUCING
THE MENSCH ON A BENCH.

00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:44,164
[ GREINER LAUGHS ]

00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,298
OH, LORD.

00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:48,201
THE MENSCH ON A BENCH IS
THE NEW JEWISH FAMILY TRADITION,

00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:51,038
DESIGNED TO BRING MORE FUN AND
MORE MEMORIES TO YOUR HOUSEHOLD.

00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:55,008
EVERY MENSCH ON A BENCH PACKAGE
COMES WITH A 12-INCH MENSCH,

00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,343
HIS VERY OWN BENCH,

00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:59,312
AND A HARDCOVER BOOK THAT TELLS
THE STORY OF MOSHE THE MENSCH.

00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:00,947
A MENSCH IS A DO-GOODER.

00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:03,183
IT'S WHAT YOU WANT YOUR CHILDREN
TO GROW UP TO BE.

00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,384
AND THE MENSCH ON A BENCH

00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,219
WOULD BECOME THE CENTERPIECE
OF YOUR HOLIDAY TRADITION.

00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,221
IT WILL WATCH OVER
YOUR MENORAH

00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:11,091
AND HOLD YOUR SHAMMASH,
OR YOUR LEADER CANDLE.

00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:13,293
NOW, SHARKS, I UNDERSTAND
YOU HAVE A LOT OF PLACES

00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,395
YOU COULD PUT YOUR MONEY
THIS HOLIDAY SEASON,

00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:18,165
BUT NONE OF THEM HOLD A CANDLE
TO THE MENSCH ON A BENCH.

00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:21,101
SO, WHO WANTS TO "GELT" TOGETHER
AND MAKE SOME MENSCHES?

00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,337
WELL, HOW DID YOU COME UP
WITH THIS IDEA?

00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:27,374
SO, I AM PART
OF AN INTERFAITH MARRIAGE,

00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:31,178
AND WE GO THROUGH
THE DECEMBER DILEMMA EVERY YEAR.

00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:33,280
WE'RE RAISING THE BOYS
JEWISH.

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,148
AND WE WERE
WALKING THROUGH A STORE,

00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,117
AND MY SON ASKED
FOR AN ELF ON A SHELF,

00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:39,453
AND I SAID, "DUDE, WE'RE JEWS.
WE DON'T DO ELVES ON SHELVES."

00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,088
"DUDE."
OKAY?

00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:42,289
WE DO MENSCHES ON BENCHES.

00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:45,058
AND THE IDEA JUST HIT ME
LIKE -- LIKE LIGHTNING.

00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,027
SO I WENT BACK,
I WROTE THE STORY OF,

00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,195
WHY WOULD YOU NEED THE MENSCH?

00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:49,463
AND EACH NIGHT IN THE STORY,

00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:52,165
WE INTRODUCE
A DIFFERENT JEWISH TRADITION.

00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,234
SO, THE JEWISH COMMUNITY
IS REALLY BEHIND THIS.

00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,335
IT'S AN EDUCATIONAL TOOL.

00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,204
CAN I SEE THE PACKAGING?

00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:03,143
I DON'T WANT TO SELL
A SEASONAL PRODUCT.

00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:05,245
I WANT TO SELL
A SEASONAL BRAND.

00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,980
AND I'M A HUGE FAN OF YOURS,
KEVIN.

00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,049
AND I KNOW
SOME OF THE THINGS YOU HATE.

00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:11,051
YOU HATE INVENTORY.
HE HATES EVERYTHING, NEAL.

00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:13,186
O'Leary: BUT, NEAL, YOU KNOW
THERE'S AN INVENTORY ISSUE,

00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,255
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE
THE PRODUCT THERE FOR THOSE

00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,357
THAT WANT TO BUY IT, BUT YOU'VE
GOT TO GUESSTIMATE RIGHT

00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,226
HOW MANY ARE GOING
TO BE THERE TO BUY IT.

00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:21,461
SO, WHAT I'VE DONE
WITH THE RETAILERS THIS YEAR IS,

00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,330
THEY ARE BUYING IT
F.O.B. CHINA,

00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,199
SO THE RETAILERS TAKE POSSESSION
OF ALL THE INVENTORY.

00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,301
WE'RE NOT TAKING THE RISK
ON THE INVENTORY.

00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:29,436
WELL, TELL US
ABOUT SALES LAST YEAR

00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,438
VERSUS WHO'S GONNA PLAY WITH YOU
THIS YEAR.

00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,340
SURE.
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MYSELF.

00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,976
I'M A FORMER
HASBRO TOY EXECUTIVE.
OOH.

00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:38,011
I'M NOT JUST A CRAZY JEWISH GUY
COMING OUT HERE.

00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,179
SO, YOU'RE STILL WORKING?
PART-TIME.

00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:41,381
I WORK THREE DAYS A WEEK.
I DO TWO DAYS ON MENSCH.

00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,250
I'M READY,
IF I GET A DEAL TODAY,

00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,417
TO QUIT MY JOB
AND DO THIS FULL TIME.

00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:49,022
SO, WE CREATED IT,
RAISED $22,000 ON KICKSTARTER,

00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,158
AND I TOLD MY WIFE,
"LET'S MAKE 1,000."

00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:53,160
SO, I SOLD
MY FULL 1,000 I MADE,

00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,196
AND THEN SOLD ANOTHER PRE-ORDERS
FOR ANOTHER 1,000 LAST YEAR.

00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:58,331
NEAL, WHAT DID YOU SELL THEM
FOR? WHAT DO THEY COST?

00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,133
THEY COST $7.45 TO MAKE.

00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,302
WHAT DO THE RETAILERS
SELL THEM FOR?

00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,337
THE BIG-BOX
WILL BE OUT AT $29.99,

00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:06,439
AND THE SPECIALTY
WILL BE AT $34.99.

00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,075
THIS YEAR, WE WILL BE
IN BED BATH &amp; BEYOND,

00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:12,012
TARGET, BARNES &amp; NOBLES,
MICHAELS, TOYS "R" US.

00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:15,382
WE ARE GOING TO DO $930,000
IN SALES THIS YEAR

00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:17,217
ON 60,000 UNITS.

00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:21,121
SO WE ANTICIPATE
MAKING $250,000 IN PROFIT.

00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:24,391
CAN WE SEE THE BOOK
THAT'S INSIDE THE PACKAGE, NEAL?

00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:27,294
Greiner: [ Laughing ]
HE NEEDS TO BE GOOD-LOOKING.

00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:32,032
O'Leary: HE IS A SCARY-LOOKING
GUY, I GOT TO TELL YOU.

00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:33,200
Corcoran:
YEAH, DEFINITELY.

00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,101
HE'S NOT A FUN-LOOKING GUY.
COULD HE HAVE A SON?

00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,037
HEY, IT'S NOT LIKE SANTA'S
A GOOD-LOOKING GUY.

00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:40,140
YOU TAKE HIM OUT OF THE PACKAGE,
AND HE IS ON HIS BENCH ALREADY.

00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,408
Hoffman: ABSOLUTELY.

00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:45,212
O'Leary: SO -- SO, NEAL,
YOU'RE ASKING FOR A VALUE,

00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:47,080
FROM ME AS A SHARK,
THAT ANTICIPATES

00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,984
YOU'LL BE SUCCESSFUL GOING
BEYOND MENSCH ON A BENCH SKU,

00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:52,986
THAT SOMEHOW
IT'S GOING TO GROW INTO A BRAND.

00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:54,321
AND I THINK
THAT'S WHERE I'M HAVING

00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:56,256
A LITTLE CHALLENGE
WITH THE LEAP OF FAITH.

00:05:56,256 --> 00:06:00,060
SO, EVEN -- EVEN IF WE JUST GROW
THE MENSCH ON A BENCH BRAND

00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,230
AND WE DRIVE DOWN
THE COST OF GOODS 10%,

00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,199
WE CAN MAKE $500,000
IN PROFIT NEXT YEAR.

00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,402
WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH THE
$150,000 TO CONTINUE DEVELOPING?

00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,438
I THINK, FOR NEXT YEAR,
DEVELOPING AN APP.

00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:13,273
AN APP?

00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:16,142
HAVE YOU SEEN ELF YOURSELF, THE
APP WHERE YOU PUT YOUR FACE --

00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:18,979
YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
THE COMPANY THAT DEVELOPED THAT

00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,380
SPENDS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
ON THAT.

00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,048
I KNOW THE GUYS
BEHIND THAT.

00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,017
I GUESS
WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME

00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:26,286
IS THAT YOU JUST WANT TO USE
THE MONEY FOR MARKETING.

00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:28,388
WELL, I THINK THE MARKETING
IS TAKING CARE OF ITSELF.

00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,057
WHAT I WANT TO DO IS FIGURE OUT
WAYS TO EXPAND THE I.P.

00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,293
THERE'S NOT AN I.P.
IN THE JEWISH COMMUNITY.

00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:35,462
THERE'S FROSTY,
THERE'S RUDOLPH, THERE'S ELVES,

00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:38,131
AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT
TO DEVELOP, BECAUSE I --

00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,433
O'Leary: NEAL, IT SEEMS YOU WANT
TO TAKE YOUR POTENTIAL $250,000

00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:41,968
TO $500,000 IN PROFIT

00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,104
AND PUT IT INTO
A WHOLE BUNCH OF ENTERPRISES

00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:46,973
THAT MAY NOT HAVE ANYWHERE NEAR
THE METRICS OF SUCCESS

00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:49,109
THAT THIS THING
SEEMS TO ALREADY HAVE.

00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,377
I-I DON'T --
I DON'T BUY INTO THAT.

00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:53,113
I THINK WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING
IS NOT QUITTING YOUR DAY JOB,

00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:54,214
CALLING THIS WHAT IT IS --

00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:57,150
A UNIQUE HOBBY FOR A COUPLE
OF MONTHS OF THE YEAR --

00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,252
AND TRYING TO EXTRACT OUT OF IT
IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS

00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,420
A MILLION BUCKS FOR YOU.

00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,989
I DON'T REALLY SEE IT
AS AN INVESTMENT.

00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,425
I DON'T SEEN MENSCH ON A BENCH
BEING A $10 MILLION TOY.

00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,361
I REALLY DON'T. AND LOOK,
I-I-I COME FROM YOUR SPACE.
SURE.

00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,163
I WORKED AT MATTEL
FOR A WHILE.

00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,998
WHAT YOU'VE DONE
IS REMARKABLE,

00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,067
JUST <i>GETTING</i> A PLUSH
INTO RETAIL.

00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:17,103
BUT I'M NOT BUYING INTO THE BIG,
UH, YOU KNOW, MENSCHY THE --

00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,373
THE -- THE REINDEER, AND --
AND APPS AND ALL THAT STUFF.

00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:23,209
I'M -- I'M NOT THERE
FOR THAT.

00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,111
I'M OUT.

TO DISPLAY MODE.

00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:57,829
LET ME SHOW YOU HOW.

00:15:00,932 --> 00:15:02,534
[ LAUGHS ]

00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:04,703
AND WHEN THE SEASON'S OVER,
NO BIG DEAL.

00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,572
YOU CAN PUT AWAY THOSE LIGHTS
FASTER THAN IT TAKES

00:15:07,572 --> 00:15:09,841
TO POLISH OFF A GLASS
OF AUNT EDNA'S EGG NOG.

00:15:09,841 --> 00:15:11,509
OBSERVE.

00:15:14,846 --> 00:15:16,514
NAILED IT.

00:15:16,514 --> 00:15:19,551
SO, WHICH OF YOU SHARKS
WOULD LIKE TO PARTNER WITH ME

00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,686
AND HELP AMERICA
SPEND LESS TIME DECORATING

00:15:21,686 --> 00:15:24,623
AND MORE TIME ENJOYING
THE HOLIDAYS WITH EVE DROP?

00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:27,592
NATHAN,
TELL ME HOW IT WORKS.

00:15:27,592 --> 00:15:31,730
SO, I BUILT THIS DISPLAY TO OPEN
UP SO THAT IT COULD FAN OUT,

00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,699
AND WE COULD SHOW YOU GUYS
BASICALLY HOW IT WORKS.

00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:37,903
THIS CAP SPINS OFF.

00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:39,471
IT HAS A GROOVE.

00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:41,573
YOU PLACE THE LIGHT
THROUGH THE GROOVE,

00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:43,575
AND THEN
YOU SPIN THE CAP DOWN.

00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:45,443
IT APPLIES
JUST A LITTLE PRESSURE

00:15:45,443 --> 00:15:47,712
TO PUSH IT AGAINST THE BASE,
WHICH HOLDS IT IN PLACE.

00:15:47,712 --> 00:15:50,515
IF YOU WANT TO LOWER IT,
QUARTER-TWIST LOWERS IT.

00:15:50,515 --> 00:15:52,484
SO, YOU STILL HAVE TO
GET UP ON THE LADDER

00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:53,685
TO RAISE THE LIGHTS UP?

00:15:53,685 --> 00:15:55,921
THAT'S OUR SECOND SKU
THAT WE'RE PUTTING INTO STORES,

00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:58,456
AND THAT'S CALLED
THE EVE DROP POLE ADAPTER.

00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,827
SO, YOU JUST CAP IT FROM --
YOU'RE STANDING ON THE GROUND,

00:16:02,827 --> 00:16:04,829
YOU GIVE IT A QUARTER-TWIST,
AND THEN IT CAN COME DOWN.

00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:06,898
QUARTER-TWIST BACK,
AND IT STAYS.
OH, THAT'S KIND OF COOL.

00:16:06,898 --> 00:16:08,733
SO, NATHAN, THAT'S PART
OF THE DEAL, THAT POLE,

00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:11,503
OR YOU PAY EXTRA FOR THAT?
YOU PAY EXTRA.
IT'S A SEPARATE SKU.

00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:14,839
GIVE US YOUR NUMBERS,
NATHAN.

00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:16,508
SALES TO DATE ARE $4,500.

00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:17,709
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:18,843
OH, MY GOD.

00:16:18,843 --> 00:16:20,612
YOU MEAN FOR THE DAY <i>TODAY?</i>

00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:23,581
NATHAN, LIGHTS OUT.
THE -- YEAH.

00:16:23,581 --> 00:16:25,817
THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE
ANY PENDING PURCHASE ORDERS.

00:16:25,817 --> 00:16:27,719
HOW LONG WAS THAT PERIOD
FOR THE $4,500?

00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:29,621
WELL, THERE'S AN EXPLANATION
FOR THAT.

00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:31,690
THERE'S A REASON
THOSE NUMBERS --
THERE ALWAYS IS.

00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,725
THAT NUMBER WAS ACTUALLY RAISED
VIA KICKSTARTER,

00:16:33,725 --> 00:16:35,860
A CAMPAIGN THAT I THREW
JUST AFTER THE CHRISTMAS SEASON

00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,697
JUST TO HELP GET SOME MONEY
TO HELP OFFSET

00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:39,931
SOME OF MY PRODUCTION COSTS,
RIGHT?

00:16:39,931 --> 00:16:41,633
SO, FROM THERE,
I TOOK THAT MONEY

00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,501
AND I HELPED TO, UH,
PRODUCE SOME OF THE MOLDS

00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:45,570
THAT I WOULD NEED
TO MAKE MY PARTS.

00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,738
SO, I DID THAT OVERSEAS.

00:16:46,738 --> 00:16:48,640
THE PARTS
HAVEN'T YET ARRIVED,

00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,476
WHICH IS WHY THE SALES ARE
THE WAY THAT THEY ARE,

00:16:51,476 --> 00:16:52,644
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:54,412
NATHAN,
IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA

00:16:54,412 --> 00:16:55,680
FOR YOU TO HAND OUT
THE PACKAGING

00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,882
SO WE CAN SEE IT
AND GET OUR HANDS ON IT.
LET'S DO IT.

00:16:57,882 --> 00:17:00,585
OH, SO --
SO <i>THIS</i> IS THE PRODUCT.

00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,824
HOW MUCH
DOES THIS RETAIL FOR?

00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:08,460
$9.99 FOR THE LIGHT HANGERS.
AND THAT RETAILS FOR?

00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,928
$3.99.
AND THAT'S FOR NOW.

00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:13,732
NATHAN, HOW MANY OF THESE
DO I NEED FOR AN AVERAGE HOME?

00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:15,567
ABOUT FIVE PACKS.
THAT'S NOT CHEAP.

00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:16,901
THAT'S $40 OR $50,
PLUS THE POLE.

00:17:16,901 --> 00:17:18,737
IT'S $40 OR $50.
IT'S A ONE-TIME EXPENSE,

00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,572
RATHER THAN BUYING CLIPS
YEAR AFTER YEAR.

00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,607
'CAUSE YOU GUYS KNOW
THOSE DON'T LAST.

00:17:22,607 --> 00:17:24,909
NATHAN, WHEN WE HAD
OUR CHRISTMAS LIGHTS UP --

00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:26,778
AND MY MOTHER
WENT WHOLE HOG

00:17:26,778 --> 00:17:29,447
PUTTING THEM
ON OUR UGLY, LITTLE HOUSE --

00:17:29,447 --> 00:17:31,583
IT WAS THE HIGH POINT
OF HER YEAR.
YEAH.

00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,551
SADLY FOR YOU,
SHE HAD A BETTER IDEA.

00:17:33,551 --> 00:17:36,621
SHE DROVE TWO SETS OF NAILS
BEHIND THE EAVES.

00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:38,523
AND WHEN IT WAS
CHRISTMASTIME,

00:17:38,523 --> 00:17:40,692
SHE DROPPED THE LIGHTS
DOWN TO THE LOWER SET.

00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,527
AND WHEN CHRISTMAS
WAS OVER,

00:17:42,527 --> 00:17:43,928
SHE LIFTED THEM UP
TO THE HIGHER SET.

00:17:43,928 --> 00:17:45,864
DOES YOUR MOM NEED A JOB?
WAIT A SECOND.

00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:48,500
Greiner: SO FAR, SHE DID
EXACTLY WHAT HE'S DOING.

00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,769
NATHAN, WE'VE GOT TO LITIGATE
BARB'S MOM!
HIS ARE EASIER.

00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:51,870
YOU KNOW WHAT, NATHAN?

00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,539
BECAUSE BARB'S MOM
WAS SMARTER THAN YOU, I'M OUT.

00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:55,573
OOH.
THANK YOU, MARK.

00:17:55,573 --> 00:17:56,574
OOH.
OOH.
OOH.
OOH.

00:17:56,574 --> 00:17:58,710
ARE YOU WORKING THIS
FULL-TIME,

00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,679
OR DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER,
GOOD-PAYING JOB?

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,449
I HAVE ANOTHER, GOOD-PAYING JOB.
I WORK IN OUTSIDE SALES.

00:18:04,449 --> 00:18:06,451
I SELL JANITORIAL
AND SANITARY PRODUCTS.

00:18:06,451 --> 00:18:07,886
I'M ACTUALLY VERY SUCCESSFUL
IN SALES.

00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:10,488
LOOK, LET ME CLEAR THE FIELD.
I HATE THIS IDEA A LOT.

00:18:10,488 --> 00:18:11,790
IT'S VERY SEASONAL.

00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,559
I THINK RETAIL'S
GONNA BE VERY CHALLENGING.

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,629
AND BECAUSE I HATE IT SO MUCH,
I'M OUT.

00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:18,763
THANK YOU, KEVIN.

00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:22,534
NATHAN, WHERE ARE YOU
IN TERMS OF THE BUSINESS?

00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:25,737
RIGHT NOW, I AM, UH, WAITING
FOR MY INVENTORY TO ARRIVE.

00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,705
HOW MUCH INVENTORY
HAVE YOU BOUGHT?

00:18:27,705 --> 00:18:29,407
$30,000.
OKAY.

00:18:29,407 --> 00:18:31,443
AND DO YOU HAVE
ANY OF IT PRE-SOLD?
YES, I DO.

00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,412
I HAVE P.O.s TO GO INTO A COUPLE
DIFFERENT CHAINS OF STORES.

00:18:34,412 --> 00:18:36,681
THE TOTAL P.O.s AT THIS POINT
ARE $3,500.

00:18:36,681 --> 00:18:38,683
IT'S GOING
TO 12 DIFFERENT STORES.

00:18:38,683 --> 00:18:41,519
OKAY, I'M NOT -- I'M NOT
AS GOOD AT MATH AS BARBARA,

00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:44,589
BUT YOU HAVE $30,000
YOU'VE BOUGHT,

00:18:44,589 --> 00:18:45,723
AND YOU'VE ONLY SOLD
$3,500.

00:18:47,492 --> 00:18:49,461
WHY DID YOU ORDER
SO MUCH AT ONE TIME

00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,628
WITHOUT HAVING
PURCHASE ORDERS?

00:18:50,628 --> 00:18:52,464
I-I-I GUESS THAT'S
THE CONFUSION, THOUGH.

00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,598
I'M ANTICIPATING
THE CHRISTMAS SEASON.

00:18:53,598 --> 00:18:55,867
I ACTUALLY DID GET APPROACHED
BY SkyMall.

00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:57,902
THEY WERE INTERESTED.
THEY VETTED IT.

00:18:57,902 --> 00:18:59,804
THEY WANTED IT
IN THEIR CHRISTMAS CATALOG.

00:18:59,804 --> 00:19:01,673
I ACTUALLY ENDED UP
DECIDING NOT TO DO IT

00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:03,908
BECAUSE I ONLY HAD ENOUGH MONEY
TO BUY THE $30,000 IN INVENTORY

00:19:03,908 --> 00:19:05,543
AND, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,

00:19:05,543 --> 00:19:07,579
I KNOW I'M GONNA SELL IT
AT A HIGHER MARGIN ELSEWHERE.

00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:09,581
Greiner: BUT WAIT A MINUTE.
THAT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE.

00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:11,449
OH, MY FRIEND.
MY FRIEND -- NATHAN -- OKAY.

00:19:11,449 --> 00:19:12,750
ONCE YOU'VE FACTORED
IN THE CO-OP --

00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,586
NATHAN, NATHAN, NATHAN,
RULE NUMBER ONE...

00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:15,753
YES.
...WHEN YOU'RE STARTING OUT,

00:19:15,753 --> 00:19:18,623
NEVER SNEER AT AN ORDER,
MY FRIEND.
YES.

00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:22,594
THE SALES GUY IN ME
REALLY GETS IRRITABLE

00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:25,930
WHEN SOMEONE TURNS DOWN
AN ORDER FROM ANYONE.

00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,799
I'M OUT.

00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,702
THAT'S FINE, ROBERT. THE REASON
I DID THAT IS 'CAUSE --

00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:32,704
BUT DOES THAT BOTHER YOU
THAT HE JUST DROPPED OUT?

00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:35,440
YOU JUST KEPT GOING ON.
NOT EVEN A PAUSE.

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,708
I WANT TO PARTNER
WITH THE PERSON

00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,543
THAT BELIEVES IN ME
AND THE PRODUCT.

00:19:38,543 --> 00:19:39,777
I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS YOU.
YES.

00:19:39,777 --> 00:19:41,479
YOU'RE NOT PERSUASIVE.

00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:42,547
IS THAT RIGHT?

00:19:42,547 --> 00:19:44,749
I THINK YO-- YES, VERY MUCH SO.
I THINK YOU --

00:19:44,749 --> 00:19:46,684
I AM THE SALESMAN OF THE YEAR
FOR MY COMPANY.

00:19:46,684 --> 00:19:48,553
WELL --
I HAVE BEEN
TWO STRAIGHT YEARS.

00:19:48,553 --> 00:19:49,854
BUT I HAVE A FULL-TIME JOB.

00:19:49,854 --> 00:19:51,589
I HAVE FOUR KIDS AT HOME
AND MY WIFE,

00:19:51,589 --> 00:19:52,790
AND I HAVE
A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITIES.

00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,559
I DON'T MEAN
FOR THAT TO BE AN EXCUSE --

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,727
BUT I MISTRUST
YOUR JUDGMENT.

00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,495
I THINK
EVERY GREAT ENTREPRENEUR

00:19:57,495 --> 00:19:59,664
HAS TO BE A GREAT SALESMAN
TO GET THEIR PRODUCT SOLD,

00:19:59,664 --> 00:20:02,634
BUT THEY ALSO HAVE TO HAVE
INNATE JUDGMENT

00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:03,835
OF WHAT TO SPEND,
WHAT TO ORDER,

00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:05,637
WHEN TO HOLD BACK,
WHEN TO PUSH FORWARD.

00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:07,672
I'M NOT SO SURE
YOU'VE GOT THAT.

00:20:07,672 --> 00:20:10,875
I WILL TELL YOU THAT I PROJECT
ALL THE TIME WITH MY NUMBERS.

00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,478
I'M IN SALES,
AND I HIT MY NUMBERS EVERY TIME.

00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:15,547
BUT PROJECTED WRONGLY
ON YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,515
I BELIEVE I DID NOT.

00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,652
THAT'S WHAT
THE NEXT EIGHT WEEKS ARE FOR.

00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:21,853
I HAVE 65 DISPLAYS COMING.

00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:24,689
I'M PLANNING ON
PLACING ALL 65.

00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:26,524
I'M PLANNING ON
SELLING IT ONLINE,

00:20:26,524 --> 00:20:27,692
AND THE MARGIN ONLINE IS 80%.

00:20:27,692 --> 00:20:30,461
I HAVE AN E-COMMERCE SITE
SET UP, ALL READY TO GO.

00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:32,497
I HAVE AMAZON
WITH THE PRODUCTS LOADED.

00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:34,732
INTERESTING. YOU'RE SELLING ME
NOW, YOU KNOW THAT?

00:20:34,732 --> 00:20:37,569
FOR THE FIRST TIME,
I'M SEEING THE SALESMAN IN YOU.

00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,903
MAYBE YOU JUST
SAVED YOURSELF FROM DEATH.

00:20:38,903 --> 00:20:39,904
LET ME THINK ABOUT THIS.

00:20:39,904 --> 00:20:41,539
OKAY.

00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:42,540
REALLY?

00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,877
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO,
LORI?

00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:47,845
YOU HAVE A HISTORY
OF TAKING REAL CRAP

00:20:47,845 --> 00:20:49,814
AND TURNING IT INTO GOLD.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:20:49,814 --> 00:20:51,849
THANK YOU, KEVIN!
WOW.

00:20:51,849 --> 00:20:54,752
NATHAN,
I THINK IT HAS <i>POTENTIAL</i>

00:20:54,752 --> 00:20:58,690
AT SOME POINT DOWN THE ROAD
TO MAYBE BE A HERO.

00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,559
RIGHT NOW,
I THINK IT'S VERY CHALLENGING.

00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,661
I THINK YOU HAVE
A LONG WAY TO GO

00:21:03,661 --> 00:21:06,497
WITH THE PACKAGING, THE DISPLAY,
AND GETTING OUT THERE.

00:21:06,497 --> 00:21:09,434
AND SO, FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.

00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,436
THANK YOU.
THAT'S OKAY.
O'Leary: OKAY, NOW.

00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:12,770
DOWN TO ONE SHARK.
BARBARA.

00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,644
ON THE ONE HAND, I SEE A LOVELY
GUY THAT SAYS HE CAN SELL,

00:21:19,644 --> 00:21:22,814
AND I SAW
A LITTLE BIT OF IT, ALL RIGHT?
I CAN SELL.

00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:26,618
ON THE OTHER HAND, I DON'T THINK
YOUR PRODUCT SELLS ITSELF,

00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,686
EVEN IF YOU COULD
GET IN THE DOOR.

00:21:28,686 --> 00:21:30,521
SO, UNFORTUNATELY,
I'M OUT.

00:21:30,521 --> 00:21:32,724
THANK YOU.

00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:33,825
GOOD LUCK, NATHAN.

00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,560
THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
YOU GUYS.

00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,928
GOOD LUCK.
HAVE A GOOD ONE.

00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:39,464
IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING,
BECAUSE FOR THE LAST YEAR,

00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,932
I'VE BEEN WANTING
TO MAKE IT ONTO "SHARK TANK."

00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:42,500
I'VE WANTED TO BE IN THE TANK.

00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,735
AND THEN,
WHEN YOU'RE IN THE TANK,

00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:45,703
YOU WANT NOTHING MORE
TO JUST GET OUT OF THE TANK.

00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:55,580
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK IS
A PRODUCT INVENTED BY A TEENAGER

00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,715
TO SOLVE A PROBLEM
SHE HAD AT HOME.

00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:08,826
HELLO! MY NAME IS ANDREA CAO,
AND I AM 13 YEARS OLD.

00:22:08,826 --> 00:22:11,596
HELLO. MY NAME'S HONG.
I'M ANDREA'S MOM.

00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:13,831
WE ARE FROM SAN LUIS OBISPO,
CALIFORNIA.

00:22:13,831 --> 00:22:15,700
WE ARE THE CREATORS
OF THE Q-FLEX.

00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,603
WE ARE SEEKING $20,000

00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:20,805
IN EXCHANGE
FOR 20% OF OUR COMPANY.

00:22:20,805 --> 00:22:23,841
I'M A NURSE.
I HAVE TO WORK LONG HOURS.

00:22:23,841 --> 00:22:27,545
AND AFTER ONE WHOLE DAY
WORKING ON MY FEET,

00:22:27,545 --> 00:22:30,581
I COME HOME SO SORE
I CAN BARELY MOVE.

00:22:30,581 --> 00:22:32,650
AND GUESS WHO SHE TURNED TO.
THAT'S RIGHT, ME.

00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:35,486
I WILL BEG ANDREA
TO MASSAGE MY BACK FOR ME.

00:22:35,486 --> 00:22:38,656
AND I LOVE MY MOM, BUT I WAS
GETTING REALLY TIRED OF THAT.

00:22:38,656 --> 00:22:39,757
SO I STARTED WONDERING,

00:22:39,757 --> 00:22:41,826
WAS THERE ANY INEXPENSIVE,
EFFECTIVE WAY

00:22:41,826 --> 00:22:43,461
FOR HER TO DO THIS
HERSELF?

00:22:43,461 --> 00:22:45,463
THERE WASN'T,
SO THAT'S WHEN WE DECIDED

00:22:45,463 --> 00:22:47,598
TO BECOME ENTREPRENEURS
AND MAKE ONE OURSELVES.

00:22:47,598 --> 00:22:49,600
WE SPEND MONTHS DRAWING OUT,
PLANNING,

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,469
AND TESTING IT
TO PERFECTION,

00:22:51,469 --> 00:22:53,438
AND FINALLY,
THE Q-FLEX WAS BORN.

00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:55,606
THE Q-FLEX IS
A PERSONAL ACUPRESSURE SYSTEM

00:22:55,606 --> 00:22:57,475
THAT IS DESIGNED
TO BE USED

00:22:57,475 --> 00:22:58,810
ON YOUR SORE SPOTS
AND KNOTTED MUSCLES

00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,478
TO RELIEVE TENSION
AND PAIN.

00:23:00,478 --> 00:23:02,747
THIS AWESOME PRODUCT CAN
GIVE YOU A REALLY NICE MASSAGE

00:23:02,747 --> 00:23:04,716
WITHOUT THOSE HUGE,
SCARY MASSAGE CHAIRS,

00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:07,552
AND WITHOUT GOING TO
A PROFESSIONAL MASSAGE PARLOR

00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,720
AND MAKING YOUR WALLET SORE,
TOO.

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,921
I MEAN,
YOU'RE ALREADY SORE ENOUGH.

00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:11,622
AND THE BEST PART IS,

00:23:11,622 --> 00:23:13,825
IS THAT YOU CAN TAKE THE Q-FLEX
ANYWHERE WITH YOU

00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:15,860
BECAUSE IT'S SO LIGHTWEIGHT
AND PORTABLE.

00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:19,564
SHARKS, WITH 65 MILLION PEOPLE
SUFFERING FROM BACK PAIN ALONE,

00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:20,865
THERE IS A HUGE MARKET
FOR THIS.

00:23:20,865 --> 00:23:22,834
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS --
CHA-CHING!

00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,736
SO, SHARKS,
COME WITH US,

00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,604
AND LET'S FLEX OUR WAY
TO SUCCESS.

00:23:26,604 --> 00:23:28,806
I HAVE SOME SAMPLES
TO PASS OUT FOR YOU GUYS.

00:23:28,806 --> 00:23:29,907
Herjavec: COOL.
Greiner: GREAT.

00:23:29,907 --> 00:23:31,776
ANDREA,
I THINK YOU'RE LYING TO US.

00:23:31,776 --> 00:23:32,777
REALLY?

00:23:32,777 --> 00:23:33,878
YEAH.
OH, NO.

00:23:33,878 --> 00:23:36,447
YEAH. THERE'S --
THERE'S NO WAY YOU'RE 13.

00:23:36,447 --> 00:23:37,615
Cuban: NO KIDDING.
OH.

00:23:37,615 --> 00:23:39,550
VERY IMPRESSIVE.
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,852
THAT WAS
A FANTASTIC PRESENTATION.

00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:41,853
THANK YOU.
HERE YOU GO.

00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:43,688
THANK YOU.

00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:46,491
SO, ONCE YOU GET BACK THERE,
I'M GONNA ASK YOU HOW WE USE IT,

00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:47,892
BUT I'M ASSUMING
I JUST KIND OF, LIKE,

00:23:47,892 --> 00:23:49,761
BEAT LORI ON THE BACK
A LITTLE BIT?

00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,496
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
WELL, NO.

00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:53,698
DO YOU LIKE IT?!
I KNOW!

00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:55,466
SO, TELL ME HOW IT WORKS.

00:23:55,466 --> 00:23:56,567
Andrea: OKAY, SO FIRST...
IT'S GREAT.

00:23:56,567 --> 00:23:57,769
...YOU'RE GONNA GRIP
THE CUSHIONED GRIP,

00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,604
AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA
PUT THE TIP OF THE Q-FLEX

00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:00,805
ON THE AREA THAT IS SORE.

00:24:00,805 --> 00:24:03,574
AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA PULL AND
RELEASE AND PULL AND RELEASE.

00:24:03,574 --> 00:24:05,610
AND DO THAT A COUPLE TIMES,
AND THEN THAT'S WHAT --

00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,546
THAT'S IT. YOU'RE DONE.
O'Leary: THAT'S IT?

00:24:08,546 --> 00:24:09,847
ACTUALLY,
IT FEELS PRETTY GOOD.
Hong: SO, THE IDEA --

00:24:09,847 --> 00:24:11,716
Corcoran: LET ME TELL YOU,
IT FEELS FABULOUS.
THANK YOU!

00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:13,751
HAVE YOU SOLD ANY OF THESE?

00:24:13,751 --> 00:24:14,886
YES, I'VE SOLD 800.

00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:16,754
800.
800?

00:24:16,754 --> 00:24:17,889
AND WHERE
WERE YOU SELLING THEM?

00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:20,758
UM, I GO DOOR-TO-DOOR
SELLING THEM IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD.

00:24:20,758 --> 00:24:22,560
[ LAUGHTER ]
GOOD FOR YOU! YEAH!

00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,561
I LOVE THAT.

00:24:23,561 --> 00:24:24,629
Andrea: THANK YOU.
BAM!

00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,597
AND FROM THERE,
WORD OF MOUTH SPREADS.

00:24:26,597 --> 00:24:28,499
THEIR FRIENDS, UM,
COME AND BUY THEM FROM US,

00:24:28,499 --> 00:24:29,667
AND THEN
THEY TELL THEIR FRIENDS.

00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:31,569
HOW MUCH
DO YOU SELL THEM FOR?

00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:32,770
FROM $25 TO $36.

00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:34,472
HOW MUCH
DO THEY COST TO MAKE?

00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:35,640
$4.50.

00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,442
[ CHUCKLES ]
A CAPITALIST IS BORN!

00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:38,509
Greiner: $25 TO $36.

00:24:38,509 --> 00:24:39,811
YOU MAKE THEM HERE
IN THE UNITED STATES?

00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,647
YES, WE DO.
AND DO YOU HAVE A WEBSITE
WHERE YOU CAN BUY THEM?

00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,482
UH, WE'RE CURRENTLY
WORKING ON THAT.

00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:46,684
ANDREA, DO YOU HAVE
A PATENT ON IT OR ANY...?

00:24:46,684 --> 00:24:49,520
UM, WE ARE WORKING WITH AN
ATTORNEY TO FILE FOR A PATENT.

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,856
PATENT ATTORNEY
IS VERY EXPENSIVE.

00:24:51,856 --> 00:24:54,659
ANDREA, FANTASTIC JOB
ON THE PRESENTATION.
THANK YOU.

00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,894
I CAN'T TELL YOU, IN THE SIX
SEASONS, HOW MANY PEOPLE

00:24:56,894 --> 00:24:59,564
STAND EXACTLY
WHERE YOU'RE STANDING,

00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:01,666
AND WE ASK THEM,
"DO YOU HAVE ANY SALES?"

00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,868
AND THEY COME UP
WITH A MILLION EXCUSES.
Cuban: YEP.

00:25:03,868 --> 00:25:07,472
AND YOU SIMPLY WENT OUT, KNOCKED
DOOR-TO-DOOR, AND DID IT.

00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:08,773
THANK YOU.
AND JUST CRUSHED IT.

00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:10,641
YOU CRUSHED IT.
ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC.

00:25:10,641 --> 00:25:11,742
THANK YOU.

00:25:11,742 --> 00:25:12,910
HERE'S THE CHALLENGE.

00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,645
I-I DON'T USUALLY
ASK THIS QUESTION,

00:25:14,645 --> 00:25:15,847
BUT WHAT'S THERE
TO STOP SOMEBODY

00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,515
FROM KNOCKING YOU OFF
ON IT?

00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:22,887
WELL, WE'VE WORKED VERY HARD ON,
UH, CREATING THE RIGHT ANGLE,

00:25:22,887 --> 00:25:26,624
AND WE ACTUALLY ARE THE ONLY
PRODUCT THAT USES A SOLID,

00:25:26,624 --> 00:25:29,527
SPECIALLY-FORMULATED,
BULLET-PROOF PLASTIC,

00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:32,763
WHICH GIVES THE RIGHT AMOUNT
OF FLEX COMBINED WITH THE ANGLE.

00:25:32,763 --> 00:25:36,467
DO YOU HAVE ANY RESEARCH
THAT SAYS THIS WORKS WELL

00:25:36,467 --> 00:25:37,635
OR IS CERTIFIED
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

00:25:38,769 --> 00:25:40,538
ACTUALLY, I'M A NURSE,

00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:43,741
AND THE IDEA BEHIND THIS IS,
WHEN OUR BODY HAS PAIN,

00:25:43,741 --> 00:25:46,577
BLOOD FLOW
TO THAT PROBLEM AREA.

00:25:46,577 --> 00:25:49,614
SO BY STIMULATING
THOSE PRESSURE POINTS,

00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:51,616
YOU ACTUALLY INCREASE
THE BLOOD FLOW TO THE AREA.

00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,484
OH, I SEE. SO --
SO IF YOU MASSAGE THE AREA,

00:25:53,484 --> 00:25:54,919
YOU GET MORE BLOOD FLOW,
AND YOU GET MORE ENERGY.

00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:56,787
YES.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH THE MONEY?

00:25:56,787 --> 00:25:59,490
WE WOULD USE THE MONEY
TO BUY A STAINLESS-STEEL MOLD

00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:00,691
SO WE COULD MAKE
A LOT MORE.

00:26:00,691 --> 00:26:02,927
AND, ALSO, WE'RE NOT JUST HERE
FOR THE INVESTMENT --

00:26:02,927 --> 00:26:05,830
AND WHAT WOULD THAT COST,
IF YOU DON'T MIND MY ASKING?
$20,000.

00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,765
AND DO YOU MIND IF I ASK,
DID YOU MENTION EARLIER

00:26:07,765 --> 00:26:09,600
HOW MUCH MONEY
YOU PUT IN THE COMPANY SO FAR?

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,838
WE HAVE INITIALLY PUT $10,000
AND OVERALL, $20,000.

00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:16,641
THAT'S A BIG INVESTMENT
IN YOUR 13-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER,

00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:17,808
WHO WAS PROBABLY 12
AT THE TIME.

00:26:17,808 --> 00:26:20,678
AND WHAT WERE YOUR TOTAL SALES
IN DOLLARS?

00:26:20,678 --> 00:26:22,480
AROUND $20,000.

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,881
SO, YOU MADE SOME GOOD MONEY,
THEN.

00:26:23,881 --> 00:26:26,617
YOU'VE -- BUT YOU'VE --
HAVE YOU PAID YOUR MOM BACK?

00:26:26,617 --> 00:26:28,553
UH, WE'RE STILL
A LITTLE BIT UNDER.
YEAH.

00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:29,687
JUST A LITTLE BIT UNDER.

00:26:29,687 --> 00:26:31,756
SO YOU'VE GOT
MOST OF YOUR MONEY BACK ALREADY.
YES.

00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,824
OOH! I LOVE WHEN THAT HAPPENS.
GOOD FOR YOU.

00:26:33,824 --> 00:26:35,893
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.
YOU'RE 13.

00:26:35,893 --> 00:26:37,662
YOU MUST BE IN GRADE 7 OR 8?

00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:39,764
8, YEAH.
OKAY, YOU'RE IN 8th GRADE,

00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,632
AND YOUR MOTHER'S
A FULL-TIME NURSE.

00:26:41,632 --> 00:26:45,870
SO, WHICH ONE OF YOU IS QUITTING
YOUR JOB TO RUN Q-FLEX?

00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,438
HER.

00:26:47,438 --> 00:26:49,507
IS THAT RIGHT?
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:51,475
BECAUSE I'M OKAY
WITH YOU QUITTING SCHOOL.

00:26:51,475 --> 00:26:52,743
THAT WOULD SHOW ME
COMMITMENT.

00:26:52,743 --> 00:26:54,879
[ LAUGHTER ]
Greiner: THAT'D BE A MISTAKE.

00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:57,615
THAT'S THE PROBLEM -- THAT'S
THE PROBLEM WITH YOUR DEAL.

00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:59,617
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
IT'S A PRODUCT.

00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:01,786
IT'S COME OUT OF A NEED,
AN INNOVATION.

00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,554
BUT TO RUN A BUSINESS
AND TURN THIS INTO A BUSINESS

00:27:03,554 --> 00:27:04,889
REQUIRES FULL TIME.

00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:06,791
UH, I COULD QUIT, BEC--
I WAS ENGINEER BEFORE.

00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,827
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT.
BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU
A BUSINESSPERSON, THOUGH.

00:27:09,827 --> 00:27:11,529
DID YOU SAY
YOU WERE AN ENGINEER?

00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:13,631
YES,
WHAT IS YOUR BACKGROUND?
I-I WAS AN ENGINEER BEFORE.

00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:15,866
YOU WERE?
AND I LOST MY HUSBAND

00:27:15,866 --> 00:27:18,803
SEVEN YEARS AGO
DUE TO A HEART ATTACK.

00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,738
SO DECIDED
TO REACH OUT TO PEOPLE,

00:27:20,738 --> 00:27:22,773
KIND OF -- KIND OF
HELP PEOPLE DIRECTLY.

00:27:22,773 --> 00:27:25,743
AND SO DECIDED
TO QUIT MY ENGINEERING JOB

00:27:25,743 --> 00:27:27,878
AND GO TO --
GO TO A NURSING SCHOOL.

00:27:27,878 --> 00:27:30,848
NOW I'M AN R.N.
WORKING FULL-TIME IN A HOSPITAL.

00:27:30,848 --> 00:27:34,885
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,
I DON'T KNOW THE BUSINESS SIDE.

00:27:34,885 --> 00:27:37,688
WE ARE HERE
LOOKING FOR A MENTOR.

00:27:37,688 --> 00:27:40,524
I APPLAUD YOU TO WANTING
TO GIVE BACK, TO BE A NURSE.

00:27:40,524 --> 00:27:41,826
I MEAN, THAT'S PHENOMENAL.

00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,662
IT'S ONE OF THE HARDEST JOBS
IN THE WORLD.

00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:46,464
BUT ON A DAY-BY-DAY BASIS,

00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:48,933
YOU KNOW,
I-I CAN'T CALL YOU EVERY DAY

00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:51,902
AND TALK ABOUT
HOW WE'RE GONNA SELL IT.

00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:55,573
THIS IS A HOBBY
FOR YOUR FAMILY.

00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:57,575
IT'S NOT A BUSINESS YET.
IT'S A PRODUCT.

00:27:57,575 --> 00:27:59,644
THE KID CAN'T QUIT SCHOOL.

00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:02,613
YOU SHOULDN'T QUIT YOUR JOB
IN THE CURRENT SITUATION.

00:28:02,613 --> 00:28:04,649
I DON'T WANT TO DIMINISH IT,

00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:07,618
BUT IT'S, IN MY VIEW,
NOT INVESTABLE.

00:28:07,618 --> 00:28:09,553
I'M OUT.

00:28:10,554 --> 00:28:12,823
Greiner:
I FEEL SO BAD SAYING THIS.

00:28:12,823 --> 00:28:15,760
I USED TO SELL A PRODUCT
THAT WAS VERY SIMILAR.

00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,528
IT HAD THE SIMILAR SHAPE.

00:28:17,528 --> 00:28:18,796
Cuban: WELL, LORI,
HOW DID YOU DO WITH IT?

00:28:18,796 --> 00:28:20,631
I THOUGHT IT WAS
A BRILLIANT, BRILLIANT PRODUCT.

00:28:20,631 --> 00:28:22,466
UM, IT WAS
A CHALLENGING PRODUCT TO SELL.
WHY?

00:28:22,466 --> 00:28:23,701
IT ENDED TRAGICALLY.

00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:25,770
I'M NOT REALLY POSITIVE WHY IT
DIDN'T WORK, 'CAUSE I LOVED IT.

00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:29,874
SO, AS MUCH AS I LOVE YOU
AND WOULD LOVE TO INVEST IN YOU,

00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,610
I FEAR FOR THE PRODUCT

00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,746
AS NOT BEING SOMETHING
THAT WE COULD MAKE SUCCESSFUL.

00:28:35,746 --> 00:28:38,582
SO, FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.

00:28:38,582 --> 00:28:41,485
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

00:28:41,485 --> 00:28:43,754
LORI, DO YOU WORRY THAT
THEY WON'T GET A PATENT FOR IT?

00:28:43,754 --> 00:28:47,491
I DO. I-I WOULD TELL HONESTLY,
I WOULDN'T SPEND THE MONEY.

00:28:47,491 --> 00:28:50,494
ANDREA, YOU KNOW, LIKE EVERYBODY
UP HERE'S TOLD YOU,

00:28:50,494 --> 00:28:51,629
VERY, VERY IMPRESSIVE.

00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:52,830
THANK YOU.

00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:55,766
I'M NOT SURE I BELIEVE
IN THE PRODUCT

00:28:55,766 --> 00:28:57,435
AS MUCH AS
I BELIEVE IN YOU.

00:28:57,435 --> 00:29:01,439
SO, FOR THAT REASON, I WISH YOU
ALL THE BEST, BUT I'M OUT.

00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,640
Cuban:
NO, WE'LL DO ALL THE WORK.

00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,841
WE RUN
ALL THE OPERATIONAL STUFF.

00:29:03,841 --> 00:29:05,810
WE'LL DO THE ACCOUNTING.
LOT OF CHATTER OVER THERE.

00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,578
I'VE GOT PEOPLE
TO DO ALL THE ACCOUNTING.

00:29:07,578 --> 00:29:09,680
I MEAN, LOOK, I THINK
YOU'RE A GREAT ROLE MODEL.

00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,582
THANK YOU.
I THINK, WITH SOME HELP --

00:29:11,582 --> 00:29:13,484
YOU KNOW, BARBARA AND I
WORK TOGETHER WELL.

00:29:13,484 --> 00:29:15,786
I CAN WHIP UP A WEBSITE
AND GET IT UP AND RUNNING.

00:29:15,786 --> 00:29:17,855
Corcoran:
WE'RE GONNA MAKE YOU AN OFFER.

00:29:17,855 --> 00:29:20,491
$25,000 FOR 25%.

00:29:20,491 --> 00:29:21,592
BUT BETTER THAN THAT,

00:29:21,592 --> 00:29:23,594
WE'RE GONNA RUN
ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR YOU.

00:29:23,594 --> 00:29:26,697
THE ONLY CONTINGENCY IS
YOU HAVE TO BE AVAILABLE ON-CALL

00:29:26,697 --> 00:29:27,698
FOR A SALES CALL.

00:29:27,698 --> 00:29:28,766
OKAY.

00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:31,902
BECAUSE <i>YOU</i> ARE GONNA
SELL LIKE CRAZY.

00:29:31,902 --> 00:29:33,671
YEAH, YOU ARE.
Andrea: THANK YOU.

00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:36,841
Corcoran:
SO, $25,000 FOR 25%, LADIES.

00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:38,576
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,814
DEAL.
DEAL.

00:29:43,814 --> 00:29:44,882
YES!
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:29:44,882 --> 00:29:46,650
OH, MY GOSH.
Greiner: CAN'T BEAT THAT.

00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:47,785
WHOO!
THANK YOU.

00:29:47,785 --> 00:29:49,620
MY PLEASURE.
CONGRATULATIONS, GUYS.

00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,489
Andrea: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
CONGRATULATIONS.

00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:52,823
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD.
THANK YOU.

00:29:52,823 --> 00:29:54,525
Greiner:
NICE JOB. CONGRATULATIONS.

00:29:54,525 --> 00:29:55,659
CONGRATULATIONS.

00:29:55,659 --> 00:29:56,694
THANK YOU.

00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:58,596
Andrea:
MY LEGS ARE SHAKING SO MUCH.

00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:00,865
IT DOESN'T FEEL REAL.
IT FEELS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.

00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:02,800
AND WE'RE JUST SO EXCITED
TO BE ABLE

00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,635
TO WORK
WITH MARK AND BARBARA.

00:30:04,635 --> 00:30:06,704
BARBARA, I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
LOOK SO RELAXED.

00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:09,640
NO, I'M TELLING YOU, IT TOOK OUT
EVERY BAD MUSCLE IN MY BACK.

00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,808
JUST LIKE THAT.

00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,785
MY NAME IS TRINA BARKOURAS.

00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:22,853
I'M FROM CORONA DEL MAR,
CALIFORNIA,

00:30:22,853 --> 00:30:24,722
AND I'M THE CREATOR
OF HOPPY PAWS.

00:30:26,757 --> 00:30:29,660
MY CHILDHOOD WAS DIFFICULT,
TO SAY THE LEAST.

00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,761
MY PARENTS SPLIT UP

00:30:30,761 --> 00:30:33,564
WHEN MY BROTHERS AND I
WERE AT A VERY YOUNG AGE,

00:30:33,564 --> 00:30:35,666
AND WE WERE LEFT
TO FEND FOR OURSELVES.

00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:36,734
BUT IT WAS A POSITIVE THING.

00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:38,702
IT GAVE ME THE TENACITY
AND STRENGTH

00:30:38,702 --> 00:30:40,437
TO FIGHT FOR EVERYTHING I HAVE.

00:30:40,437 --> 00:30:42,773
BECAUSE MY CHILDHOOD
WAS SO DIFFICULT,

00:30:42,773 --> 00:30:45,743
I WANT TO MAKE SURE
I DO EVERYTHING I CAN

00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:46,911
TO MAKE MY KIDS FEEL LOVED.

00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:48,779
I DECIDED I WANT
MY CHILDREN'S HOLIDAYS

00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:50,548
TO BE EXTRA SPECIAL.

00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:53,484
SO I CAME UP WITH A GREAT IDEA
THAT GOT THEM REALLY EXCITED.

00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:54,752
IT BECAME A FAMILY TRADITION,

00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:57,521
AND NOW I'VE DECIDED
TO TURN IT INTO A BUSINESS.

00:30:57,521 --> 00:30:58,823
RECENTLY, I GOT SEPARATED,

00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:01,559
AND I FOUND MYSELF
ON MY OWN AGAIN.

00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:04,562
I LOOK AT CHALLENGES IN LIFE
AS AN OPPORTUNITY.

00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:07,731
YOU CAN EITHER WALLOW,
OR YOU CAN GO OUT AND SUCCEED.

00:31:07,731 --> 00:31:09,466
GETTING A DEAL
WITH ONE OF THE SHARKS

00:31:09,466 --> 00:31:10,668
WOULD MEAN I CAN SHARE
MY FAMILY'S TRADITION

00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:12,837
WITH MILLIONS OF FAMILIES
EVERYWHERE.

00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:32,456
HI, SHARKS.
I'M TRINA BARKOURAS.

00:31:32,456 --> 00:31:36,460
I'M FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,
AND MY COMPANY IS HOPPY PAWS.

00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:40,898
I'M HERE TODAY SEEKING $50,000
FOR A 10% STAKE IN MY COMPANY.

00:31:40,898 --> 00:31:43,434
I'VE CREATED
HOPPY PAWS STAMPING KITS

00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:45,903
AS A SAFE, SIMPLE,
AND INEXPENSIVE WAY

00:31:45,903 --> 00:31:49,740
TO DELIGHT CHILDREN EVERYWHERE
WITH PROOF OF A VISIT

00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,710
BY SANTA AND HIS REINDEER,
AND MANY, MANY MORE.

00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:55,779
SO, SHARKS, LET'S GET YOU
INTO THE HOLIDAY SPIRIT.

00:31:55,779 --> 00:31:57,781
'TWAS THE NIGHT
BEFORE CHRISTMAS,

00:31:57,781 --> 00:31:59,683
KIDS ARE SNUGGLED IN BED.

00:31:59,683 --> 00:32:02,920
TIME TO PREP FOR ST. NICK.
I HAVE NOTHING TO DREAD.

00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,789
I GRIN TO MYSELF
LIKE A JOLLY OLD ELF

00:32:05,789 --> 00:32:08,893
JUST ADD WATER AND STAMP,
BUY THEM RIGHT OFF THE SHELF

00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:11,695
IN THE MORNING,
I'LL WAKE TO SQUEALS OF DELIGHT

00:32:11,695 --> 00:32:15,532
HOPPY CHRISTMAS TO ALL,
AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT.

00:32:15,532 --> 00:32:17,601
NOW, WHICH ONE OF YOU SHARKS

00:32:17,601 --> 00:32:19,570
WANTS TO SHARE
MY FAMILY TRADITION

00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,672
AND HOP ALL THE WAY
TO THE BANK WITH ME?

00:32:21,672 --> 00:32:22,740
WHAT'S THE PRODUCT?

00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,575
IT'S AN -- ACTUALLY,
IT'S A STAMPING KIT.

00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:26,543
ISN'T THIS WHAT WE USED TO SEE
FOR EASTER FOR --

00:32:26,543 --> 00:32:28,679
IS THIS THE SAME BRAND
THAT'S BEEN AROUND FOR YEARS?

00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:29,880
NO, BUT I HAVE
SOME SAMPLES FOR YOU.

00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,615
Greiner:
FOR PAINTING EGGS, YOU MEAN?

00:32:31,615 --> 00:32:32,816
LIKE, THOSE -- YEAH.
YEAH.

00:32:32,816 --> 00:32:36,453
IT HAS A SIMILAR LOOK TO THE
EGG-PAINTING KIT, DOESN'T IT?

00:32:36,453 --> 00:32:37,922
IT HAS A SIMILAR FEEL,
MM-HMM.

00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:40,591
HERE YOU GO, ROBERT.
THANK YOU.

00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:42,660
HERE YOU GO, LORI.
THANK YOU.

00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,895
MR. WONDERFUL.
THANK YOU.

00:32:44,895 --> 00:32:46,563
YOU'RE WELCOME.

00:32:46,563 --> 00:32:50,567
SO, MY STAMPING KITS
ARE COMPRISED, AS YOU CAN SEE,

00:32:50,567 --> 00:32:52,903
OF A BOX,
A THERMOFORM TRAY...

00:32:52,903 --> 00:32:54,905
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
APPRECIATE IT.

00:32:54,905 --> 00:32:56,640
...POWDER
THAT'S MIXED WITH WATER.

00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,876
SIMPLY DIP THE STAMP
INTO THE TRAY AND STAMP AWAY.

00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:00,744
Corcoran:
WHAT IS IT -- FLOUR?

00:33:00,744 --> 00:33:03,447
NO, IT'S ACTUALLY
SUPER-SECRET POWDER.

00:33:03,447 --> 00:33:04,748
IT'S A FOOD-GRADE PRODUCT.

00:33:04,748 --> 00:33:06,650
DO I JUST WASH IT OFF
WHEN I'M DONE WITH IT?

00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,585
IT'S ACTUALLY BIODEGRADABLE.
CLEANS UP WITH WATER.

00:33:08,585 --> 00:33:09,887
Greiner: SO, YOU COULD DO IT
ON CARPETING?

00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:11,855
YOU COULD DO IT ON CARPETING
AND VACUUM IT UP.

00:33:11,855 --> 00:33:14,525
AND, SO,
IT'S A SEASONAL PRODUCT.

00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:16,927
YOU SELL IT IN ONCE,
AND THEN IT'S DONE.

00:33:16,927 --> 00:33:18,929
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
I HAVE THE EASTER BUNNY,

00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:20,664
SO WE'D MAKE A LITTLE TRAIL

00:33:20,664 --> 00:33:23,500
THAT GOES TO THE CHILD'S EASTER
BASKET, AND THEN AN ELF --

00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,469
I GOT IT.
WHAT'S THE NEXT ONE?

00:33:25,469 --> 00:33:27,871
THIS IS THE TOOTH FAIRY.
CHILDREN LOSE 20 TEETH.

00:33:27,871 --> 00:33:29,773
NOW, YOU'RE STRETCHING
ON THAT ONE.

00:33:29,773 --> 00:33:32,443
WHAT'S YOUR BEST SELLER?
MY BEST SELLER?

00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:34,511
UM, WHAT YOU'RE HOLDING
RIGHT THERE IN YOUR HAND,

00:33:34,511 --> 00:33:36,513
THAT BOX CAME OFF THE PRESS
YESTERDAY.

00:33:36,513 --> 00:33:38,449
SO YOU'RE JUST STARTING
TO SELL ALL THIS NOW?

00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:39,717
THIS IS A STARTUP.

00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:40,818
OHH!
OHH!
OHH, OKAY!
OHH!

00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:43,787
SO WE CAN'T REALLY ASK YOU
WHAT'S THE MOST POPULAR,

00:33:43,787 --> 00:33:45,756
BECAUSE
YOU'RE JUST FINDING OUT.

00:33:45,756 --> 00:33:47,458
CORRECT. 90 DAYS AGO,

00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,927
I WENT TO SAN DIEGO WITH AN IDEA
AND A VERY ROUGH PROTOTYPE.

00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:51,929
WAIT, WAIT. 90 --
THIS ALL STARTED 90 DAYS AGO?

00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:53,797
90 DAYS AGO. SO --
SERIOUSLY?

00:33:53,797 --> 00:33:55,566
YES.
I CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA

00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:57,668
20 YEARS AGO
WHEN MY KIDS WERE LITTLE.

00:33:57,668 --> 00:33:59,870
I WOULD GO THROUGH
THIS HOUR-LONG PROCESS

00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,705
AT NIGHT BEFORE EASTER.

00:34:01,705 --> 00:34:03,674
SO, PEOPLE WOULD COME BY
IN THE MORNING,

00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:06,510
'CAUSE I'D HAVE THE TRAILS GOING
UP MY WALK, AND THEY'D SAY,

00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,679
"WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?
I WANT THAT FOR <i>MY</i> KIDS."

00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,714
WELL, WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING
IS, THOUGH,

00:34:10,714 --> 00:34:14,618
IN THAT FAST OF A TIME,
YOU CREATED YOUR PACKAGING.

00:34:14,618 --> 00:34:16,920
YOU CREATED YOUR PRODUCT.
I MEAN, YOU DID A DISPLAY.

00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,822
I'M A GO-GETTER.
THAT'S A LOT OF WORK.

00:34:18,822 --> 00:34:20,791
I'M A SURVIVOR.
YOU DESERVE
A LOT OF CREDIT FOR THAT.

00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:22,659
I'VE BEEN ON MY OWN
SINCE I WAS 16 YEARS OLD.

00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:24,628
MY MOTHER HAD ME EMANCIPATED.

00:34:24,628 --> 00:34:26,563
SHE WALKED INTO A COURT OF LAW
AND SAID,

00:34:26,563 --> 00:34:27,731
"I DON'T WANT TO BE RESPONSIBLE

00:34:27,731 --> 00:34:29,733
FOR THIS LITTLE GIRL
ANY LONGER."

00:34:29,733 --> 00:34:32,603
I WENT TO TACO BELL AND MADE
BURRITOS FOR A YEAR AND A HALF

00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:34,471
TILL I GRADUATED
FROM HIGH SCHOOL.

00:34:34,471 --> 00:34:37,608
I MOVED TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
WITH $300, IN MY CAR,

00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:38,709
AND HERE I AM TODAY.

00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:40,677
I'VE SOLD HOMES
FOR $4 MILLION.

00:34:40,677 --> 00:34:42,546
I'M AN INTERIOR DESIGNER.

00:34:42,546 --> 00:34:45,482
AND I'M VERY SUCCESSFUL
AT EVERYTHING THAT I DO.

00:34:45,482 --> 00:34:47,651
I KNOW THIS IS A GOOD IDEA,
AND I KNOW IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT.

00:34:47,651 --> 00:34:49,553
BUT IF YOU'RE SO SUCCESSFUL
AT ALL THOSE THINGS,

00:34:49,553 --> 00:34:50,654
HOW DO YOU EVEN
HAVE TIME --

00:34:50,654 --> 00:34:51,855
BECAUSE I QUIT ALL OF THAT
TO DO THIS.

00:34:51,855 --> 00:34:53,757
YOU QUIT ALL THAT FOR --
THIS IS WHAT I DO FULL-TIME.

00:34:53,757 --> 00:34:54,892
WHOA.
Herjavec: NO, YOU DID NOT.

00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:56,493
YES, I DID.

00:34:56,493 --> 00:34:57,761
I BELIEVE YOU.
I BELIEVE THAT.

00:34:57,761 --> 00:34:59,563
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
SELL THIS FOR?

00:34:59,563 --> 00:35:02,666
OKAY. RIGHT NOW,
ON MY FIRST PRODUCTION RUN,

00:35:02,666 --> 00:35:03,667
IT COST ME $2 TO MAKE.

00:35:03,667 --> 00:35:05,536
AND THE REASON
I WANT THE $50,000

00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:07,805
IS BECAUSE I NEED TO INCREASE
MY PRODUCTION TO 50,000 UNITS

00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:09,506
SO I CAN GET IT DOWN
TO UNDER $1.

00:35:09,506 --> 00:35:10,641
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA SELL IT FOR?

00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:12,476
Herjavec: OH,
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

00:35:12,476 --> 00:35:14,645
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO OUT
AND SPEND ALL YOUR MONEY

00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:16,647
ON INVENTORY
BEFORE YOU HAVE SOME ORDERS.

00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:18,549
UNLESS YOU'RE WILLING
TO SELL DOOR-TO-DOOR.

00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:20,784
OR UNLESS YOU HAVE A PURCHASE
ORDER WE HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT.

00:35:20,784 --> 00:35:25,456
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M COMPLETELY
FARMING AT MICHAELS RIGHT NOW.

00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,458
I'M GOING
FOR WALGREENS, WALMART.

00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,926
WHAT DO THEY TELL YOU?
WHAT DO THEY TELL ME?

00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:30,694
I HAVEN'T --
THEY HAVEN'T TOLD ME ANYTHING.

...I PICKED THAT UP
AT 5:00 YESTERDAY AFTERNOON.

SO WE DON'T KNOW
IF ANY OF THIS IS GONNA SELL.

HEY, AMEN FOR HUSTLE,
BOY. AMEN.

00:35:38,735 --> 00:35:40,504
TRINA, YOU'RE GONNA PAY $2
TO MAKE IT.

00:35:40,504 --> 00:35:41,638
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
SELL IT FOR?

00:35:41,638 --> 00:35:42,840
$7.99.
O'Leary: TRINA...

00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,410
...JUST A SERIOUS QUESTION,
BECAUSE I AM MR. WONDERFUL,

00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:47,578
AND I CARE
ABOUT BARBARA'S MONEY.

00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:48,645
OKAY. [ CHUCKLES ]

00:35:48,645 --> 00:35:50,814
WHY DO YOU THINK
IT'S WORTH $500,000?

00:35:50,814 --> 00:35:52,816
'CAUSE YOU'RE TELLING ME
I GET 10% FOR $50,000,

YOU'VE SOLD NOTHING.

I DON'T WANT HER
TO PUT HER MONEY TO WASTE.

I SWEAR YOU'RE BUYING THIS.

HALF A MILLION DOLLARS?

SAY, "I WANT TO
GET ON 'SHARK TANK' ONE DAY."

AND I SAY TO THEM, "WHY DON'T
YOU -- WHY DON'T YOU APPLY?"

"OH, I'M NOT READY.

KIDS LIKE WITH A GENERAL MARKET.

MY OPINION IS THAT MY KIDS
WOULDN'T GET SUPER EXCITED

WHY IS THE CARPET DIRTY?"

UM,
THERE ARE NO SALES TODAY.

00:37:39,656 --> 00:37:40,791
CORRECT.

I HAVE ONE SALE THREE DAYS AGO.
I WALKED IN COLD.

MY OPINION IS,
KIDS AREN'T GONNA LIKE IT.

THAT'S SIMPLY MY OPINION.
I MIGHT BE WRONG.

00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,764

POINT ABOUT THE SIMILARITY

YES, IT IS.
IT'S IN MY COMPANY.

YES. I WOULD, BARBARA.
OKAY.

00:40:18,714 --> 00:40:21,650
BECAUSE IT WOULD CHANGE
THE SIZE OF YOUR DISPLAY,

00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:23,519
WHICH WOULD BE
AN ENORMOUS ADVANTAGE

00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:24,787
IN SOME OF
THE BIG-BOX STORES.

00:40:24,787 --> 00:40:27,623

00:40:27,623 --> 00:40:29,692
DONE EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING
FOR MY KIDS.

00:40:29,692 --> 00:40:31,660
I WOULD TAKE A SPRAY BOTTLE,
OKAY?

00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:34,463
I WOULD SPRAY THE FLOOR --
TWO LITTLE DOTS,

00:40:34,463 --> 00:40:36,465
THEY DIDN'T LOOK AS GOOD
AS THIS -- AND SPRINKLE IT.

00:40:36,465 --> 00:40:37,600
CAN I TELL YOU?

00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,536
I HAD THE ADVANTAGE
OF WATCHING MY SON RESPOND TO IT

00:40:40,536 --> 00:40:41,804
AND NOW
MY 8-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER.

00:40:41,804 --> 00:40:45,574
THEY GO CRAZY! THEY FOLLOW THE
TRACKS. THEY CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

IT'S, LIKE, PROOF
THAT SANTA CLAUS EXISTS.

I TOTALLY KNOW
THIS THING WORKS,

00:40:48,844 --> 00:40:50,880
AND YOU'VE DONE IT
SO MUCH BETTER.

00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,750
SO, I WANT
50% OF YOUR BUSINESS...

OH, NO PROBLEM. I'LL GIVE YOU
THE LINE OF CREDIT.
OKAY.

00:41:16,772 --> 00:41:18,441
PURCHASE ORDERS,
I LOVE TO FUND.

00:41:19,842 --> 00:41:23,646
WOULD YOU CONSIDER
49% AND 51%?

00:41:24,914 --> 00:41:27,716
AS LONG AS <i>YOU</i> CONSIDER
[CHUCKLES]

00:41:27,716 --> 00:41:29,718
THAT IF YOU
GET TIRED OF THIS,

00:41:29,718 --> 00:41:32,488
THAT YOU THINK
OF YOUR NEXT FIVE IDEAS,

00:41:32,488 --> 00:41:33,823
BECAUSE YOU'RE A LITTLE MACHINE
OF IDEAS.

00:41:33,823 --> 00:41:35,658

I HAVE TWO MORE.

00:41:35,658 --> 00:41:38,461
YOU'RE THE BEAST.
[ Chuckling ] YOU'RE THE BEAST.

00:41:38,461 --> 00:41:40,596
AND ALL THOSE IDEAS
ARE <i>OUR</i> IDEAS GOING FORWARD.

00:41:40,596 --> 00:41:41,931
OKAY. WE'RE EQUAL PARTNERS
ON THOSE NEW IDEAS.

00:41:41,931 --> 00:41:43,566
HOW'S THAT SOUND?
YOU GOT IT. I LOVE IT.

00:41:43,566 --> 00:41:46,602
YOU GET 51% NOW. I GET 49%.
I GIVE YOU $100,000,

00:41:46,602 --> 00:41:49,805
BUT ON ALL FUTURE IDEAS,
WE'RE 50/50.

00:41:50,773 --> 00:41:52,741
OKAY, GREAT.

00:41:52,741 --> 00:41:54,477
