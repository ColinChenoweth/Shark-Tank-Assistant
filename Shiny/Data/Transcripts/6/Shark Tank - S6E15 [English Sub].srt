Narrator:
WELCOME TO THE SHARK TANK,

00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:04,271
WHERE ENTREPRENEURS
SEEK AN INVESTMENT

00:00:04,271 --> 00:00:07,107
TO START, GROW, OR SAVE
THEIR BUSINESS.

00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:08,442
DEAN, URIJAH,
SHOW THEM WHAT WE GOT!

00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:10,143
BOOM!
OOH.

00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:11,378
I HAD THIS LIGHT-BULB MOMENT.

00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:13,280
Narrator: IF THE SHARKS HEAR
A GREAT IDEA,

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,249
THEY'LL INVEST
THEIR OWN MONEY...

00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:17,150
WHAT IF I VALUED IT
AT $6 MILLION?

00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,253
...AND FIGHT EACH OTHER
FOR A DEAL.

00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:22,089
I'M NOTED FOR MY CREATIVITY.
THE OTHER GUYS ARE BRAIN-DEAD.

00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:24,358
Narrator: BUT THE ENTREPRENEURS
MUST GET THE FULL AMOUNT

00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:27,060
THEY'RE ASKING FOR, OR THEY'LL
WALK AWAY WITH NOTHING.

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,230
NEVER HAVE I HEARD SOMEBODY
TALK SO MUCH AND SAY SO LITTLE.

00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,465
HOLD ON!
LET ME FINISH.

00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:33,333
GET IT OUT!
WHAT IS IT?!

00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,969
IT'S GONNA GET REALLY UGLY
IN A MINUTE.

00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,071
Narrator:
WHO ARE THE SHARKS?

00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:44,411

SELLING A CHILDREN'S

FOR OVER $4 BILLION.

00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,357

WAY TO ILLUMINATE YOUR LIFE.

00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,213
MY NAME IS MAX.

I'M THE FOUNDER AND CREATOR

00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:06,293
LUMIO.

00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:10,397
IT'S AN ELEGANT
LIGHTING SOLUTION

00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:13,033
THAT GIVES YOU THE FREEDOM

00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:15,335

WHEREVER YOU ARE.

00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,104
OH, WOW.

00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:19,239
PRETTY COOL.
LET ME SHOW YOU SOME OF THE WAYS
YOU CAN USE LUMIO.

00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:23,377
OPEN IT AND IT CREATES
A NICE AMBIENT LIGHT.

00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:27,347
YOU CAN OPEN IT
ALL THE WAY, 360.

00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:34,054
OR USE IT
AS DIRECTIONAL TASK LIGHTING

00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:35,288
TO READ OR WRITE.

00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:40,193
AND IF YOU HAVE MULTIPLE UNITS,
YOU CAN COMBINE THEM TOGETHER.

00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:45,032
THIS FIXTURE INSIDE
HAS SUPERSTRONG MAGNETS,

00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:50,003
SO YOU CAN CONFIGURE THIS
INTO MANY DIFFERENT FORMS.

00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:54,041
[ CHUCKLES ]
THAT'S REALLY COOL.

00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,242
SO BEAUTIFUL.

00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:57,044
THANK YOU, ROBERT.

00:02:57,044 --> 00:03:00,213
YOU CAN ALSO USE IT
ON ANY VERTICAL SURFACES.

00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:05,152
IT JUST HAS TO GO
TO METAL.
CORRECT.

00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:06,420
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,290
THE BEST WAY TO EXPERIENCE
AND UNDERSTAND THE PRODUCT

00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,026
IS FOR YOU TO REALLY HOLD IT
IN YOUR HANDS.
YEAH.

00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,161
I BROUGHT A FEW SAMPLES
WITH ME.

00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:15,996
HERE YOU GO, ROBERT.

00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:17,164
THANK YOU.

00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:18,231
OH!

00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:19,299
[ LAUGHS ]

00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,201
OH, THAT'S SO COOL!

00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,270
SO, MAX, IT'S OBVIOUSLY
BATTERY-OPERATED.

00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,238
HOW LONG
DO THE BATTERIES LAST FOR?

00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:28,275
EIGHT HOURS,
AND THAT'S THE WHOLE IDEA.

00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:31,044
I DON'T WANT TO JUST DESIGN
SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL.

00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,212
I WANT IT FUNCTIONAL.

00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,381
SO EIGHT HOURS IS ENOUGH POWER
TO LAST YOU OVERNIGHT.

00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,184
IT'S RECHARGEABLE
THROUGH MICRO USB.

00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:38,485
IT TAKES
ABOUT THREE TO FOUR HOURS

00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,387
TO GET THE FULL CAPACITY
OF EIGHT HOURS.

00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,122
John: THIS IS COOL.

00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:44,391
SO, MAX, IT BRINGS A SMILE
TO YOUR FACE WHEN YOU OPEN IT.

00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:47,994
TELL ME YOUR VISION
BEHIND THE APPLICATION OF IT.

00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,996
THIS IS A LIGHTING SOLUTION

00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:52,265
THAT YOU CAN USE
AROUND THE HOUSE

00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:53,467
FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER,

00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:56,303
BUT ALSO, I THINK
OUTDOOR MARKET IS HUGE.

00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:58,305
WE LAUNCHED JUST LAST YEAR.

00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:02,342
WE DID $1 MILLION WITHOUT
ANY ADVERTISING, MARKETING.

00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:03,376
$1 MILLION?
CORRECT.

00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:04,411
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:08,014
WE GOT CLOSE TO $580,000
ON KICKSTARTER.

00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:09,015
WOW.
WOW.

00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,017
WHAT WAS YOUR GOAL?
$60,000.

00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,220
WHAT DO YOU
SELL THEM FOR?

00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,256
CURRENTLY,
WE'RE SELLING $190 PER UNIT.

00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,458
$190?
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE ONE?

00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,161
RIGHT NOW,
WE ARE AT $65.

00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:25,232
DAYMOND, FIRST YEAR,
OUR COST OF GOODS WAS $80.

00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:27,134
IN THE PAST THREE MONTHS,

00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:32,005
WE ARE ABLE
TO LOWER IT DOWN TO $65.

00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,074
I LIVED IN THE FACTORY
FOR FOUR MONTHS.

00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:35,242
WHAT COUNTRY?

00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:36,276
I HAD TO GO TO CHINA.

00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,211
SO THAT YOU COULD
WATCH THE PROCESS

00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,013
AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO IMPROVE IT?

00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,081
EXACTLY.

00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:44,017
IT LOOKS SIMPLE, BUT IT'S
ALL ABOUT THE DETAILING.

00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,353
YOU BELIEVE YOU CAN GET
THAT $65 PRICE WAY DOWN?

00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:47,387
CORRECT.

00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,322
TO WHAT?
YEAH, TO WHAT?

00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:53,059
THE IDEAL FOR ME IS $50,
WHICH IS 33% OF REVENUE.

00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,327
WHERE ARE YOU SELLING
MOST OF THESE?

00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,163
MUSEUM OF MODERN ART
IN NEW YORK,

00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:59,166
MOCA IN L.A., SFMOMA,
COOPER HEWITT,

00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,967
AND WE DO HAVE
AN E-COMMERCE,

00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,435
AND THAT'S ALSO
40% OF THE SALES.

00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,304
RIGHT NOW,
PART OF THE PAIN POINT

00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,173
IS WE CANNOT KEEP UP
WITH DEMAND.

00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,108
OKAY, SO, YOU'RE LIMITING
YOUR DISTRIBUTION

00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:09,309
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T KEEP UP
WITH DEMAND.

00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,377
EXACTLY.

00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:12,312
O'Leary: WHAT ABOUT
LIGHTING DISTRIBUTORS?

00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,247
ANYBODY APPROACH YOU AND SAY,
"LOOK, I WANT TO SUPPORT

00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,448
THE 10,000 LIGHTING STORES
IN AMERICA"?

00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:18,084
THEY <i>HAVE</i> APPROACHED ME,
BUT HERE'S MY VISION --

00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,352
I WANT TO BUILD A BRAND.

00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:22,322
THIS YEAR, THE FOCUS
IS TO PARTNER WITH GREAT BRANDS.

00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,058
I FOCUS ON
THE BRAND-BUILDING COMPANIES

00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,293
THAT I WANT TO WORK WITH.

00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:30,230
WHAT STORES IN THE U.S.
WOULD YOU ACTUALLY SELL IT?

00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,332
GIVE ME SOME BRANDS
OUTSIDE OF THE MUSEUM STORES.

00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,401
I THINK DESIGN WITHIN REACH
WOULD BE A GREAT FIT.

00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:37,204
BUT ARE YOU PLANNING
ON EXPANDING

00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:39,973
INTO A BROADER BASE
OF RETAILERS?

00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:41,241
I'M LOOKING INTO THAT
NEXT YEAR.

00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:43,009
YOU KNOW,
YOU CANNOT BE TOO GREEDY,

00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,377
AND I DON'T WANT TO DILUTE
THE BRAND.

00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,413
ARE YOU SAYING TO KEVIN,
"YOU CANNOT BE TOO GREEDY"?

00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:48,014
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,317
Cuban: MAX, KEEP ON TELLING US
ABOUT YOUR VISION.

00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:53,119
THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING
THAT FOLLOWS THIS. WHAT'S NEXT?

00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,055
SO, I'VE CREATED
THIS PROTOTYPE.

00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:56,223
SO, IT'S A MINI VERSION.

00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:58,291
John: MM!
Cuban: WOW.
Herjavec: WOW!

00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:02,128
AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN ASKED
BY OUR DISTRIBUTOR IN JAPAN,

00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:03,463
AND THEY SAY,
"EVERYONE IS ASKING

00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:06,266
Greiner: CAN I SEE IT?
ABOUT THE MINI VERSION."

00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:07,968
SO, IT'S A LITTLE
NIGHT-LIGHT.

00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:09,069
CORRECT.

00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:13,073
SO, IF THIS IS
MORE FOR USE AROUND THE HOUSE,

00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:15,242
I WANT THIS
TO LIVE IN YOUR BAG.

00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:17,277
AND THESE DAYS,
EVERYONE WHO IS MOBILE,

00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:20,046
YOU'RE ALWAYS
RUNNING OUT OF JUICE.

00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,182
NOW,
THIS HAS THE CAPABILITY

00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:24,451
FOR YOU TO RECHARGE

O'Leary:
SO, THIS YEAR'S SALES,

00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:28,421
IF EVERYTHING KEEPS GOING
WITH YOUR CONTROLLED CHANNELS,

00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,357
HAVE YOU ESTIMATED
WHAT YOUR SALES WILL BE?

00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:34,294
YES -- CONSERVATIVE, $2 MILLION.
$2.5, VERY DOABLE.

00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:36,162
AND WHAT WILL YOU MAKE ON THAT,
DO YOU THINK

00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:37,364
15%.

00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:39,165
I MEAN,
I THINK THIS WOULD BE GREAT

00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,968
IN THE SLS OR THE W's ROOMS,
AND PEOPLE CAN TAKE THEM.

00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,971
EXACTLY. I'M STEPPING --
INCHING TOWARDS THAT.

00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,406
Herjavec:
I THINK IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,309
EVERY TIME WE OPEN IT,

YOU WENT TO THE FACTORY.

00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,217
I DON'T THINK WE EVER HAD
ANYBODY COME OUT HERE

AND SAY,
"I GOT A FACTORY IN CHINA,

00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:00,287
AND I WENT AND LIVED THERE
FOR FOUR MONTHS."

00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:03,189
AND I KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE,
AND THAT WAS NOT EASY.

00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,025
IT'S NOT EASY.
IT'S NOT EASY.

00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,226

00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:03,416
BUT KEVIN
SURPRISINGLY SUGGESTS

00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,418
A HIGHER VALUATION
FOR THE COMPANY.

00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:09,189
YOU'RE BASICALLY VALUING
YOUR BUSINESS AT $3.1 MILLION.

00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,391
WHAT IF I VALUED IT
AT $6 MILLION?

00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,227
WHOA.

00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:17,063
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
THE $250,000,

00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,399
AND YOU'RE GONNA PAY IT BACK
TO ME UNTIL I DOUBLE MY MONEY.

00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:22,302
YOU'LL PAY ME $7 A UNIT
UNTIL I GET $500,000 BACK.

00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:25,105
THEN THAT GOES AWAY
IN PERPETUITY. IT'S GONE.

00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,974
AND I'LL HAVE A 4% OWNERSHIP
IN THE COMPANY

00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,142
FOR PROVIDING THAT,

00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:32,278
AND, OF COURSE, I'LL HELP YOU
FINANCE YOUR PURCHASE ORDERS.

00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,414
THE KEY TO MY OFFER
IS THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN,

00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:37,317
YOU WALK OUT OF HERE
WITH A $6.2 MILLION VALUATION.

00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:39,185
AND I'VE REFLECTED
IN MY STRUCTURE --

00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,420
AND I'M NOTED
FOR MY CREATIVITY.

00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,222
THE OTHER GUYS
ARE BRAIN-DEAD HERE.

00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:43,423
THEY DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DO THIS.

00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,193
IT'S, UM, THANK YOU --

00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,461
MAX, WHEN THIS SHOW AIRS,
RIGHT,

00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:51,031
THERE'S GONNA BE
AN AMAZING AMOUNT

00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,365
OF DEMAND
FOR THE PRODUCT.

00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,435
IS SELLING FROM YOUR WEBSITE
TO "SHARK TANK" VIEWERS

00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:57,270
SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK

00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,040
THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE INVENTORY
TO DO?

00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,074
E-COMMERCE IS
NUMBER-ONE PRIORITY

00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,142
BECAUSE THE MARGIN
IS THE HIGHEST.

00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:03,376
Herjavec: I AGREE.

00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,945
OKAY, SO, YOU WANT TO MAXIMIZE
THE NUMBERS THERE.
EXACTLY.

00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,080
BECAUSE YOU TAKE THE STRATEGY
MULTIPLE DIRECTIONS.

00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,114
RIGHT, MARK.

00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,416
OKAY, I'LL MAKE YOU
AN OFFER, THEN,

00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,384
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT I WANTED TO KNOW.

00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,421
OH, SHARK FIGHT.
SHARK FIGHT. SHARK FIGHT.

00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:16,122
OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S MY STRENGTH,
IS E-COMMERCE,

00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,390
AND, OBVIOUSLY,
BUILDING YOUR BRAND,

00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,092
YOU'RE DOING IT
THE EXACT RIGHT WAY.

00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:20,326
THE PRODUCT
SPEAKS FOR ITSELF,

00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,429
AND IT'S AN APPROACH
THAT I HAPPEN TO AGREE WITH.

00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:27,167
I'LL OFFER YOU $500,000

00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:30,236

RIGHT OFF THE BAT.

IN MY OFFER -- THE ONLY ONE

TO FINANCE AGAIN
IF YOU WISH TO SELL IT.

00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,189

00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:58,491
WHAT DO YOU DO?

YOU WANT ME TO GET UP

00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:01,361
I DON'T NEED

00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,102
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:10,403
YES, IT IS.
NOT AT ALL.

00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,272
KEVIN, YOU'RE RAISING VENTURE
AROUND THE WORLD.

00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:13,973
YOU'RE NOT
PRODUCT-ORIENTATED.
THIS IS NOT
A VENTURE DEAL.

00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,408
THIS IS ACTUALLY HELPING YOU
FINANCE YOUR GROWTH.

00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,277
I KNOW IT'S NOT A VENTURE DEAL.
THAT'S MY POINT.

00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:18,311
THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE.

00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:19,979
NO, BUT HE WANTS
SOMEBODY TO DO R&amp;D.

00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:22,015

WITH THE SPIKE

00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:10,977
'CAUSE NOW THE FOUR OF US

00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:13,146
ARE MAKING BEHINDS
LOOK AMAZING EVERYWHERE.

WHO BELIEVE THEY HAVE A SOLUTION
TO A CHRONIC PROBLEM.

00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,203
HI, SHARKS.

00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:40,139
MY NAME IS NEIL,
CO-FOUNDER OF THE NAPWELL.

00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,442
WE'RE BASED
IN SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA,

00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,011
AND ARE SEEKING $100,000

00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:47,447
IN EXCHANGE
FOR 10% OF OUR COMPANY.

00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,282
THIS IS JUSTIN.

00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,417
HE'S WHAT WE LIKE TO CALL
A SLEEP ZOMBIE.

00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:52,418
[ YAWNS ]

00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,220
MAYBE
YOU'VE MET HIM BEFORE.

00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,023
HE'S ON THE SUBWAY,
IN THE LINE AT THE COFFEE SHOP,

00:15:57,023 --> 00:16:00,393
AND THE ONE THAT YOU HONK AT
DURING YOUR MORNING COMMUTE.

00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:02,161
IN THE U.S.,

00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:05,231
TWO OUT OF EVERY FIVE PEOPLE
ARE SLEEP ZOMBIES.

00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:09,135
FOR THOSE OF US THAT CAN'T GET
A FULL NIGHT'S REST, WE NAP.

00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:13,072
THAT'S WHY WE BUILT NAPWELL,
THE WORLD'S FIRST NAPPING MASK.

00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:15,074
WE WANT TO HELP YOU
NAPTIMIZE.

00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,243
"NAPTIMIZING" MEANS
FALLING ASLEEP GENTLY

00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:19,378
AND WAKING UP
FEELING REFRESHED.

00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:21,280
YOU SEE,
WHEN YOU SLEEP,

00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,416
YOUR BODY CYCLES
THROUGH DIFFERENT STAGES.

00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:27,086
IF YOU'RE AWOKEN ABRUPTLY
IN A DEEP STAGE OF SLEEP,

00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,221
YOU GET
A NASTY HEADACHE.

00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:31,057
SCIENTISTS CALL THIS FEELING
SLEEP INERTIA,

00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:32,391
AND PERHAPS
YOU'VE FELT IT YOURSELF.

00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,060
IT'S THAT GROGGY FEELING

00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,362
THAT JUST RUINS
YOUR ENTIRE DAY'S PRODUCTIVITY.

00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,998
THE NAPWELL
HELPS YOU NAPTIMIZE

00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,434
BY USING LIGHTS
TO MIMIC A SUNRISE

00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,236
AND WAKE YOU GRADUALLY.

00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:45,972
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS SET THE TIMER,

00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:48,241
AND 10 MINUTES BEFORE
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO WAKE UP,

00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:50,042
THE MASK GETS BRIGHTER,

00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:53,112
AND IT PREVENTS
THOSE NASTY HEADACHES.

00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,214
SLEEP IS VITAL
TO A PERSON'S WELL-BEING,

00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,250
BUT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
DON'T GET ENOUGH SLEEP.

00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:01,320
WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN HELP
THESE PEOPLE ONE NAP AT A TIME.

00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,091
SO, WHO WANTS TO JOIN US
AND HELP THE WORLD NAP WELL?

00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:07,260
OKAY, WE HAVE
TWO SPECIAL PROTOTYPES

00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,295
THAT WE WOULD
LOVE YOU TO TRY.

00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:11,297
WHO WANTS
TO GIVE IT A SHOT?

00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:14,300
THIS IS NOT FOR SLEEPING
AT NIGHT -- ONLY NAPPING?

00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,335
IT <i>CAN</i> BE USED
FOR SLEEPING AT NIGHT.

00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:19,105
HERE --
I'M GONNA HAVE ROBERT DO IT.

00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:20,206
SO, THIS GOES
OVER YOUR NOSE?

00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,207
OVER YOUR NOSE LIKE --

00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,208
OVER YOUR NOSE.

00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,409
THAT GOES
ON TOP OF YOUR NOSE.

00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:26,145
Greiner:
THE LIGHTS ARE OFF NORMALLY.

00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,313
Joglekar: CORRECT.

00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:29,382
BUT YOU SET IT SO THAT
IF YOU'RE GONNA TAKE A NAP --

00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,250
QUIET, LORI.
I'M SLEEPING.

00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,385
[ LAUGHS ]

00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,387
IF YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE A NAP
FOR 20 MINUTES,

00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,456
THEN AT THE LAST COUPLE
OF MINUTES,

00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,058
THE LIGHTS START TO GO
GRADUALLY.

00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,459
SO,
THE LAST 10 MINUTES.

00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,361
I MEAN, LOOK,
WE'VE ALL TAKEN POWER NAPS.

00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:43,329
SURE.

00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:45,131
I'VE NEVER HAD
A BAD POWER NAP.

00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:46,098
<i>I</i> HAVE.

00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:47,266
YOU HAVE? SERIOUSLY?

00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:49,068
NO, IF I NAP
IN THE AFTERNOON...

00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,169
IT MEANS YOU'RE OLD.

00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:51,437
...I WAKE UP
FEELING CRABBY.

00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,306
IT DOES NOT MAKE ME
FEEL BETTER.

00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:55,308
SO, WHEN YOU SLEEP,
YOUR BODY CYCLES.

00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:57,343
IF YOU WAKE UP
IN STAGE 3 AND 4,

00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:59,245
THAT'S WHEN YOU GET
THESE GROGGY HEADACHES.

00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,247
SO, JUSTIN,
THAT'S COMMON SCIENCE, RIGHT?

00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,983
I MEAN, THEY TEACH YOU ALL THIS
REM SLEEP AND EVERYTHING.

00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:05,284
YOU GOT TO GET
CERTAIN CYCLES OF SLEEP.

00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,352
AND EVERYBODY KNOWS
ABOUT THAT.

00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:08,220
BUT WHERE ARE YOU
WITH THE COMPANY?

00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,122
ARE YOU A SCIENTIST?
ARE YOU A DOCTOR?

00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,191
SO, JUSTIN AND I ACTUALLY MET
AT A 7th GRADE SUMMER CAMP.

00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,993
AT LEAST, WE LIKE
TO CALL IT SUMMER CAMP.

00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:15,094
REALLY,
WE MET AT NERD CAMP.

00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,464
HE WAS LEARNING MEDICINE,
AND I WAS LEARNING PASCAL,

00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:21,000
AN OLD
COMPUTER-PROGRAMING LANGUAGE.

00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,402
AND, SO, THE IDEA WAS
THAT WE'D ALWAYS GO
TO COLLEGE TOGETHER,

00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:25,071
BUT HE ENDED UP
GOING TO M.I.T.,

00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:27,039
AND I ENDED UP GOING
TO THE WEST COAST, TO STANFORD.

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,274
Lee: SO I DID MY UNDERGRAD
AT M.I.T.,

00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,276
DOUBLED
IN PHYSICS AND BIOLOGY.

00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,044
WOW.
DID MY MASTER'S THERE
ALSO,

00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,212
BUT IN
MECHANICAL ENGINEERING.

00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:35,181
SO RIGHT NOW, THOUGH,
I AM A PhD STUDENT

00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:38,217
IN A JOINT M.I.T./HARVARD
MEDICAL SCHOOL PROGRAM

00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:39,385
FOR MEDICAL ENGINEERING
AND MEDICAL PHYSICS.

00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:41,053
OH, WOW.

00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,455
AND I JUST WRAPPED UP
A PROJECT

00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,290
FUNDED BY
THE GATES FOUNDATION

00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,059
TO DEVELOP DRONES
FOR VACCINE DELIVERY IN AFRICA.

00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,995
SO, YOU HAVE NO CREDIBILITY,
IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:50,162
John:
AND YOU CAME UP WITH <i>THIS?</i>

00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:51,464
THAT'S
REALLY IMPRESSIVE.
IT IS.

00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,332
I MEAN,
THAT'S REALLY IMPRESSIVE.

00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:56,202
HOW DID YOU GO FROM ALL OF THAT
TO MAKING A MASK?

00:18:56,202 --> 00:19:00,072
WE SEE STARTUPS AS SORT OF
A SERIES OF TESTS OF HYPOTHESES.

00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,407
THE FIRST HYPOTHESIS WAS...

00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:02,441
WELL SAID.

00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,410
...CAN WE MAKE
A PHYSICAL PRODUCT?

00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,445
AND SO
WE BUILT THE PROTOTYPE.

00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,080
THE SECOND TEST WAS,

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,116
"COULD WE GET PEOPLE
WE DIDN'T KNOW

00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:11,250
TO BUY THE PRODUCT?"

00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,219
THAT'S WHY WE DID
THE CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGN.

00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:15,254
SO, OUR GOAL FOR THAT
WAS $30,000.

00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:18,290
WE ENDED UP SELLING
ABOUT $52,000 WORTH OF PRODUCT.

00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,292
WHAT WERE YOU SELLING
PER UNIT?

00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:23,195
WE ACTUALLY USED CROWDFUNDING
TO TEST DIFFERENT PRICES.

00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:24,397
WE SOLD IT
FROM $50 TO $150.

00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:26,098
Greiner:
I HAVE A QUESTION.

00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:27,433
WHAT TYPE OF TESTING
DID YOU DO

00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:29,268
TO SEE
WHETHER OR NOT THIS WORKS?

00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,437
FROM THE KICKSTARTER FUNDING
ITSELF,

00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:34,273
THOSE BACKERS
HAVE BEEN OUR EARLY TESTERS.

00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:35,975
SO YOU SENT THEM MASKS.

00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:38,244
WE DELIVERED ABOUT 100 MASKS
TO OUR EARLY CUSTOMERS.

00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:40,046
AND THEY REPORTED
BACK TO YOU.
CORRECT.

00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:41,280
THEY DOCUMENTED
HOW THEY FELT EVERY DAY.

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,984
I SLEEP ON AVERAGE
THREE, FOUR HOURS A NIGHT.

00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:46,318
I'M ALWAYS TIRED.
REALLY?

00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,421
ISN'T THE PROBLEM THAT
MOST PEOPLE <i>CAN'T</i> GET TO SLEEP?

00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:51,157
THE BASIC PROBLEM IS PEOPLE'S
SLEEPING HABITS IN GENERAL.

00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:54,193
SO, WHEN WE WERE FIGURING OUT
HOW WE MIGHT SOLVE THAT PROBLEM,

00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,228
WE DEBATED
A LOT OF DIFFERENT PRODUCTS.

00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:57,396
THE MASK
WASN'T THE FIRST ONE.

00:19:57,396 --> 00:20:00,232
WE THOUGHT ABOUT PILLOWS,
WE THOUGHT ABOUT BLANKETS.

00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:01,233
SO WE THINK
THERE'S A GAP

00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,435
IN THE MARKET
FOR WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY.

00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:05,204
IF YOU WALKED INTO ANY V.C.
IN THE VALLEY

00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,206
WITH YOUR BACKGROUND,

00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,974
IF YOU JUST SNEEZE
AND CALL IT A STARTUP,

00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:12,411
YOU HAVE THE ABILITY
TO RAISE $250,000 TO $300,000.

00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,046
SO WHY
HAVEN'T YOU DONE THAT?

00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:18,117
FOR ME, LIKE,
I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT BEFORE.

00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:21,487
I'M NEW TO THE -- I'M REALLY NEW
TO THE STARTUP WORLD.

00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:24,223
SO, WE REALLY WANTED
TO VALIDATE TO OURSELVES

00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,325
THAT THIS WAS
A VIABLE PRODUCT.

00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:29,261
I'M NOT BUYING THAT,
"WELL, WE JUST DECIDED

00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:32,198
"TO SKIP THE OPPORTUNITY
TO GO GRAB SOMEBODY'S MONEY

00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:35,067
"TO COME ON 'SHARK TANK'
AND NEGOTIATE A VALUATION

00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,104
BECAUSE WE'RE DYING
TO HAVE ONE OF THESE SHARKS."
YOU GUYS,
YOU GUYS, WAIT.

00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:39,338
I'M NOT BUYING IT, GUYS.
I'M NOT BUYING IT.
LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION, OKAY?

00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:40,372
John:
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:41,974
I'M OUT, GUYS.
FOR ME, THE BASICS --

00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:42,975
I'M OUT.

00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,312
OKAY, SO MARK'S OUT.
SO, LET ME
ASK A QUESTION.

00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:48,147
LET ME TAKE A SHOT AT THIS,
ALL RIGHT?

00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:49,315
I HAVE
A DIFFERENT PROBLEM.

00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:51,217
YOU'VE NEVER ACTUALLY
BROUGHT TO MARKET

00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:54,120
A CONSUMER GOOD, PRODUCT,
OR COMPANY, OKAY?

00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,287
THAT'S CORRECT.

00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:58,290
SO, BETWEEN YOUR PROTOTYPE
AND A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS

00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,493
THAT'S SHIPPING MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS' WORTH OF PRODUCT,

00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:02,995
THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF HURT
THAT HAPPENS,

00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:05,131
AND ONE OF THEM
IS THE MARKETING ASPECT OF THIS,

00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:08,367
BECAUSE IT LOOKS TO MOST PEOPLE
THAT SEE IT ON THE SHELF

00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:11,337
AS A SLEEP MASK THAT THEY'RE
USED TO PAYING $1.99 FOR.

00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:15,274
THAT IS A TASK FROM HELL.

00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,376
IT'S GOING TO BE
REALLY TOUGH.

00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:19,178
AND FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.

00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:25,184
TO ME, I THINK PEOPLE HAVE
TROUBLE <i>GOING</i> TO SLEEP.

00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:29,054
I DON'T THINK
IT'S A BIG PROBLEM WAKING UP.

00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,290
THERE'S A MILLION DEVICES
OUT THERE TO WAKE UP.

00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,425
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.

00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:39,231
THE PATH TO SUCCESS
IS NEVER IN A STRAIGHT LINE.

00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:42,334
YOU GUYS ARE SUPERSMART GUYS.
YOU SHOULD BE EXTREMELY PROUD.

00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:45,271
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT YOU'RE GONNA TAKE

00:21:45,271 --> 00:21:48,174
ALL OF THAT BACKGROUND
AND EDUCATION

00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:51,210
AND ALL THAT SUFFERING THAT
YOUR PARENTS PUT YOU THROUGH

00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,244
TO MAKING A SLEEP MASK.

00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:54,380
IT'S JUST TOO CHALLENGING.

00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:57,082
FOR ALL THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.

00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:58,317
APPRECIATE IT.

00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,385
ALL RIGHT,
WHO'S LEFT?

00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:01,320
ME. WELL, UM...

00:22:03,222 --> 00:22:06,225
...I'M A GUY WHO BELIEVES YOU
SHOULD HAVE PROOF OF CONCEPT,

00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:09,328
THEN YOU BUILD A BUSINESS
AND PROVE THAT THE MODEL WORKS.

00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,362
IT'S JUST TOO EARLY.

00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:14,033
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.

00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:15,134
THANK YOU.

00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:16,335
Joglekar: OKAY.

00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,403
Herjavec:
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.

00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:19,071
CONGRATS.

00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:20,406
I LIKE THEIR ONESIES.

00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:24,176
Jonglekur:
I THINK THEY FELT LIKE WE WERE
A PRODUCT IN SEARCH OF A MARKET,

00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,978
BUT WHAT
THEY DIDN'T REALIZE,

00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:28,180
AND WHAT WE PROBABLY
DID A POOR JOB OF EXPLAINING,

00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,049
IS THAT THE DEMAND
FOR THIS PRODUCT

00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:31,283
AND THE MARKET
ARE ENORMOUS,

00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:33,319
AND THAT'S WHY
WE'RE SO EXCITED ABOUT IT.

00:22:40,928 --> 00:22:42,729
MY NAME IS KRISTINA GUERRERO,

00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:44,832
AND I LIVE IN THE SMALL TOWN
OF LA PINE, OREGON,

00:22:44,832 --> 00:22:45,999
WITH MY HUSBAND, BRANDON,

00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:48,702
AND OUR TWO CANINE SIDEKICKS,
DUNKAN AND ODIN.

00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:49,803
Guerrero: GOOD BOY!

00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:51,972
WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER,
THINGS GOT PRETTY ROCKY AT HOME,

00:22:51,972 --> 00:22:54,775
SO WHEN I WAS 17, I APPLIED
TO THE AIR FORCE ACADEMY,

00:22:54,775 --> 00:22:56,810
AND IT WAS THE BEST DECISION
I EVER MADE.

00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,812
I GRADUATED AS A LIEUTENANT

00:22:58,812 --> 00:23:02,850
AND WENT ON TO FLY C-130s
IN SUPPORT OF THREE DEPLOYMENTS.

00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:07,020
AFTER THE AIR FORCE,
I DECIDED TO FOLLOW MY PASSIONS.

00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,957
IT BASICALLY BROUGHT ME
TO THE BACKCOUNTRY OF OREGON.

00:23:09,957 --> 00:23:12,025
I'M A MOUNTAIN GIRL, AND I LOVE
HANGING OUT WITH MY DOGS.

00:23:12,025 --> 00:23:14,027
MY DOGS AND I WERE
AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN

00:23:14,027 --> 00:23:16,063
WHEN I REALIZED
I DIDN'T PACK ENOUGH SUPPLIES.

00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:17,898
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT,
AND I REALIZED

00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:20,033
THERE'S A REALLY SIMPLE SOLUTION
TO THIS PROBLEM.

00:23:20,033 --> 00:23:22,636
SO WE GOT HOME, AND I STARTED
FORMULATING MY PRODUCT

00:23:22,636 --> 00:23:24,638
AND OUR BUSINESS
HAS BEEN GROWING EVER SINCE.

00:23:24,638 --> 00:23:26,907
GREAT. LET ME JUST GET DOWN
YOUR PHONE NUMBER.

00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:29,042
SINCE I'VE STARTED
THIS BUSINESS,

00:23:29,042 --> 00:23:30,944
IT'S BEEN AN UPHILL BATTLE.

00:23:30,944 --> 00:23:32,779
I'VE BEEN MAKING
A LOT OF MISTAKES,

00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:34,581
AND I PUT MY SAVINGS
ON THE LINE.

00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:36,717
I DEFINITELY NEED SOMEONE
WITH MORE BUSINESS SAVVY

00:23:36,717 --> 00:23:38,585
TO HELP MY COMPANY EVOLVE,

00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:41,622
AND I HOPE THAT THE SHARKS
CAN SEE HOW DETERMINED I AM

00:23:41,622 --> 00:23:43,624
TO MAKE THIS BUSINESS
SUCCESSFUL.

00:23:56,637 --> 00:23:57,671
[ CHUCKLES ]

00:23:57,671 --> 00:23:58,939
[ CHUCKLES ]

00:23:58,939 --> 00:24:00,040
HI.

00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,810
MY NAME IS KRISTINA GUERRERO,
AND THIS IS ODIN,

00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,779
AND WE'RE OUT HERE TODAY
FROM LA PINE, OREGON,

00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:07,915
ASKING FOR $100,000

00:24:07,915 --> 00:24:11,885
FOR A 20% STAKE
INTO OUR COMPANY, TurboPUP.

00:24:11,885 --> 00:24:15,055
LIKE A LOT OF DOG OWNERS,
MY DOGS AREN'T JUST MY PETS.

00:24:15,055 --> 00:24:16,723
THEY'RE MY SIDEKICKS.

00:24:16,723 --> 00:24:19,626
WHETHER I'M SKIING,
HIKING, TRAVELING --

00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:21,061
EVEN SWIMMING WITH SHARKS --

00:24:21,061 --> 00:24:23,030
CHANCES ARE MY DOG IS WITH ME.

00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:27,000
BUT WHAT <i>WASN'T</i> FUN WAS
PACKING BULKY BAGS OF DOG FOOD,

00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,803
ESPECIALLY WHEN WEIGHT,
QUALITY, AND SIZE MATTER.

00:24:31,905 --> 00:24:36,577
SO I CREATED TurboPUP --
COMPLETE CANINE MEAL BARS.

00:24:36,577 --> 00:24:39,046
TurboPUP BARS ARE MADE
WITH 100% AMERICAN-SOURCED,

00:24:39,046 --> 00:24:42,749
HUMAN-GRADE, ALL-NATURAL,
GRAIN-FREE INGREDIENTS.

00:24:42,749 --> 00:24:44,918
THEY'RE SAFE
ON SENSITIVE STOMACHS

00:24:44,918 --> 00:24:47,688
AND INTERCHANGEABLE
WITH REGULAR DOG FOOD.

00:24:47,688 --> 00:24:49,923
WHEN I'M OUT IN THE BACKCOUNTRY
OR TRAVELING,

00:24:49,923 --> 00:24:52,092
I'M MAKING SURE
I HAVE THE FUEL I NEED.

00:24:52,092 --> 00:24:53,794
WOW.
SO I DESIGNED TurboPUP BARS

00:24:53,794 --> 00:24:56,964
SPECIFICALLY TO SUSTAIN
DOGS' ENERGY LEVELS...

00:24:56,964 --> 00:24:57,998
[ LAUGHS ]

00:24:57,998 --> 00:25:00,968
...AND, OF COURSE,
FUEL ALL DOGKIND.

00:25:00,968 --> 00:25:03,003
IF YOU GUYS
WANT TO CHECK OUT THE BARS,

00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:05,639
I CAN BRING THEM OVER
AND YOU CAN GIVE SOME TO ODIN.

00:25:05,639 --> 00:25:07,641
YEAH.
LET'S DO THAT.
Greiner:
I WOULD LOVE THAT.

00:25:07,641 --> 00:25:08,775
ALL RIGHT.

00:25:08,775 --> 00:25:09,810
IS THIS EDIBLE
FOR HUMANS, TOO?

00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:11,845
'CAUSE YOU SAID
IT WAS HUMAN-GRADE.

00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:13,814
IT'S HUMAN-GRADE INGREDIENTS,
'CAUSE WE JUST WANTED

00:25:13,814 --> 00:25:15,749
TO MAKE SURE
THAT THEY WERE SUPER-PREMIUM.

00:25:15,749 --> 00:25:18,986
SO, EACH ONE OF THOSE BARS
IS 250 CALORIES,

00:25:18,986 --> 00:25:21,088
SO YOU CAN ONLY GIVE THEM
JUST A LITTLE PIECE.

00:25:21,088 --> 00:25:22,789
HE REALLY LIKES IT!
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:24,658

00:25:24,658 --> 00:25:25,892
YOU'RE IN TROUBLE NOW,
ROBERT.

00:25:25,892 --> 00:25:28,028
THAT WHOLE BAR
WENT DOWN.

00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:29,029
HE LIKES IT.

00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:30,831
[ Laughing ]
OH, MY GOD.

00:25:30,831 --> 00:25:31,898
COME ON, ODIN.

00:25:31,898 --> 00:25:33,066
KEVIN, DO YOU WANT
TO GIVE HIM SOME?

00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:35,035
I'LL PASS ON THAT,
KRISTINA.
OKAY.

00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:37,037
[ BOTH LAUGH ]

00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:40,974
I'VE SEEN REAL HYENAS ON THE
RANGES OF ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA,

00:25:40,974 --> 00:25:43,977
AND LET ME TELL YOU,
THAT'S A HYENA, NOT A DOG.

00:25:43,977 --> 00:25:44,978
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:25:44,978 --> 00:25:46,680
KRISTINA,
WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT

00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,750
THAN THE OTHER 5,000 DOG TREATS
ON THE MARKET?

00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,752
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT.

00:25:51,752 --> 00:25:52,819
IT'S <i>NOT</i> A DOG TREAT.

00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:53,987
WHAT IS IT?
A SANDWICH?

00:25:53,987 --> 00:25:55,622
IT'S A COMPLETE MEAL.

00:25:55,622 --> 00:25:57,958
SO, THAT'S 250 CALORIES.

00:25:57,958 --> 00:25:59,960
AND BECAUSE
THE INGREDIENTS ARE SO PREMIUM,

00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,729
YOU CAN JUST INTERCHANGE IT
WITH REGULAR DOG FOOD.

00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:04,765
SO, HOW EXPENSIVE IS IT
IF IT'S SO PREMIUM?

00:26:04,765 --> 00:26:08,635
SO, THE ONE-PACKS,
MSRP IS $2.99,

00:26:08,635 --> 00:26:10,604
AND THE TWO-PACKS,
MSRP IS $4.99.

[ LAUGHTER ]

00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:13,674
KRISTINA, IS IT LIKE AN
ENERGY BAR FOR DOGS, BASICALLY?

00:26:13,674 --> 00:26:14,808
[ Laughing ] NO.

00:26:14,808 --> 00:26:17,778
NO, BUT IT WAS DESIGNED
TO <i>SUSTAIN</i> ENERGY.

00:26:17,778 --> 00:26:19,613
WELL, TELL ME,
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES SO FAR

00:26:19,613 --> 00:26:20,747
AND WHERE
ARE YOU SELLING THEM?

00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:23,583
SO, I STARTED SELLING
IN MAY 2013.

00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,052
THESE WERE THE BARS
THAT I STARTED WITH.

00:26:25,052 --> 00:26:26,987
I WAS MAKING THEM
OUT OF MY KITCHEN.

00:26:26,987 --> 00:26:29,856
I WAS HAND-CUTTING
AND HAND-SEALING EACH BAR.

00:26:29,856 --> 00:26:31,091
HOW MUCH DID YOU SELL?

00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:33,593
WE HAD $4,000 IN SALES.

00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:35,662
OKAY, AND THEN THIS YEAR,
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU SOLD?

00:26:35,662 --> 00:26:38,732
WE'VE SOLD...$7,000.

KRISTINA,
WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND?

00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:44,671

WHEN I WAS 17, I LEFT HOME,

00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:46,907
WENT TO THE UNITED STATES
AIR FORCE ACADEMY.

00:26:46,907 --> 00:26:49,943
GRADUATED FROM THE AIR FORCE
ACADEMY IN 2002.

00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:52,979
GOOD FOR YOU.
WENT ON, BECAME A DISTINGUISHED
GRADUATE OF PILOT TRAINING,

00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:55,615
FLEW C-130s
THROUGH THREE DEPLOYMENTS.

00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:56,750

00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,985
RECEIVED TWO COMBAT AIR MEDALS
FOR THE DEPLOYMENTS

00:26:58,985 --> 00:27:01,888

OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM.

00:27:03,056 --> 00:27:04,825
I CAME HOME
FROM MY THIRD DEPLOYMENT.

HIM AND I
WERE BACKCOUNTRY SKIING.

00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:08,061
WE WENT ABOUT 8 MILES
UP THE MOUNTAIN.

00:27:08,061 --> 00:27:10,964
I HAD A BURRITO
OR SOME CHOCOLATE POWER BARS.

00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:13,767
I, OF COURSE, DIDN'T THINK
OF PACKING DOG FOOD.

00:27:13,767 --> 00:27:15,969
HE ATE THE BURRITO,
I ATE THE POWER BAR,

00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:18,905
AND I HAD THIS LIGHT-BULB MOMENT
WHERE I JUST THOUGHT,

00:27:18,905 --> 00:27:21,641
"WHY DON'T THEY HAVE
SOMETHING LIKE THIS

00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:25,712

00:27:27,714 --> 00:27:28,849
WHO'S BUYING IT?

00:27:28,849 --> 00:27:30,016
THIS IS
THE REALLY INTERESTING PART.

00:27:30,016 --> 00:27:32,919
BECAUSE THE PET MARKET
IS SO SATURATED,

00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:34,888
I DECIDED TO TRY
ANOTHER ROUTE.

00:27:34,888 --> 00:27:36,890
I DECIDED TO START
APPROACHING OUTDOOR STORES.

00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:37,991
AND HOW DID THEY RESPOND?

00:27:37,991 --> 00:27:39,025
STOKED.

00:27:39,025 --> 00:27:40,961
WHILE I WAS MAKING THE BARS
OUT OF MY KITCHEN,

00:27:40,961 --> 00:27:43,029

BIKE SHOPS, LIKE,
OUTDOOR PLACES?
YEP. YEP.

00:27:50,871 --> 00:27:53,740
THAT'S SMART, BECAUSE
THERE'S A STRONG CORRELATION
BETWEEN THE TWO.

00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,008
AND THERE'S NO COMPETITION
RIGHT NOW.

00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,977
I GOT TO TELL YOU,
THAT'S VERY, VERY CLEVER.
THAT'S VERY SMART.

00:27:56,977 --> 00:27:58,979
SO, RIGHT NOW,
I HAVE ABOUT 30 RETAILERS,

00:27:58,979 --> 00:28:01,581
BUT THE CONVERSATION IS THERE
WITH MUCH BIGGER RETAILERS,

00:28:01,581 --> 00:28:04,918
AND WE'RE ALSO TALKING TO
A PET STORE THAT HAS 55 STORES.

00:28:04,918 --> 00:28:07,988
AND THIS IS JUST TO START.
AND THIS IS A ONE-WOMAN SHOW.

YOUR MOVE TO GO INTO
THE OUTDOOR STORES -- BRILLIANT.

00:28:12,893 --> 00:28:15,662
THE ISSUE FOR ME IS,
WHEN I PARTNER WITH SOMEBODY,

00:28:15,662 --> 00:28:17,697
I TRY TO GO ALL-IN
AND HELP AND LEARN.

00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:19,866
I JUST DON'T KNOW YOUR AREA
AT ALL.

00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:20,934
OKAY.

00:28:20,934 --> 00:28:23,770
AND I JUST DON'T HAVE
THE TIME, IN REALITY,

00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,806
TO DIG IN
AND LEARN IT FOR YOU.

00:28:27,908 --> 00:28:28,875

BUT, YOU KNOW, NOT EVERY
BUSINESS THAT COMES OUT HERE

00:28:37,584 --> 00:28:38,685
IS READY
FOR AN INVESTMENT.

00:28:38,685 --> 00:28:39,953

IS DESTINED TO BE
A BIG BUSINESS <i>TODAY.</i>

KEEP DOING
WHAT YOU'RE DOING,

00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:46,793
GET THE SALES
FROM $7,000 TO $100,000,

00:28:46,793 --> 00:28:48,728
AND <i>THEN</i> MAYBE
LOOK FOR AN INVESTMENT.

00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:49,629
RIGHT --

00:28:49,629 --> 00:28:50,730

YOU KNOW, KRISTINA,

00:28:53,767 --> 00:28:57,904
I AM NOT SURE
ABOUT THE MARKET FOR THIS.

00:28:57,904 --> 00:28:59,973
YOU'RE KIND OF FORGING AHEAD
IN SOMETHING NEW.

00:28:59,973 --> 00:29:03,710
YOU ARE MAKING A MEAL FOR A DOG,
AND YOU'RE LEARNING.

00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:06,646
DO PEOPLE NEED IT AND WANT IT
OR DON'T THEY?

00:29:06,646 --> 00:29:08,715
SOMETIMES IT'S GOOD
TO SLOWLY GROW

00:29:08,715 --> 00:29:10,717
AND KEEP DOING
WHAT YOU'RE DOING

00:29:10,717 --> 00:29:14,821
AND LEARNING HOW BIG THE MARKET
IS FOR THIS STEP BY STEP.

00:29:14,821 --> 00:29:17,624
AND THEN YOU GROW
IN A SMART WAY.

00:29:18,058 --> 00:29:19,826
I'M OUT.

00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:21,761

THERE IS TWO.

00:29:25,866 --> 00:29:28,869
OKAY, I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS PITCH.

00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:33,840
$7,000 IN THE
MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR
PET-FOOD MARKET

00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,775
IS TURBO-POOP ON A STICK.

00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:39,646
YOU HAVE TO FIGURE THIS OUT
AND MAKE IT MORE COMPELLING.

00:29:39,646 --> 00:29:41,681
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA GET
AN INVESTMENT. I'M SORRY.

00:29:42,949 --> 00:29:44,017
I'M OUT.

00:29:44,017 --> 00:29:45,619
OKAY.

00:29:46,853 --> 00:29:49,756
I'M ON THE FENCE, YOU KNOW,
BECAUSE $100,000 FOR 20%,

00:29:49,756 --> 00:29:51,892
THAT VALUES YOUR COMPANY
AT $500,000.

00:29:51,892 --> 00:29:53,760
THE PROBLEM IS,
YOU'RE ASKING SO MUCH,

00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,629
I WOULD HAVE TO <i>TAKE</i>
SO MUCH.

00:29:55,629 --> 00:29:58,632
WHAT WOULD YOU ASK,
AS FAR AS YOUR EQUITY?

00:29:58,632 --> 00:29:59,866
THE GAMBLE
THAT I WOULD TAKE WITH YOU IS,

00:29:59,866 --> 00:30:01,835
BECAUSE OF YOUR TOURS
AND EVERYTHING ELSE,

00:30:01,835 --> 00:30:02,869
YOU MUST BE DISCIPLINED.

00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:04,804
OBVIOUSLY, YOU DON'T SLEEP,
JUST LIKE ME.

00:30:04,804 --> 00:30:07,707
WELL,
THEY SAY THAT THE TURBO

00:30:07,707 --> 00:30:09,776
IS BECAUSE I HAVE TWO MODES --
TURBO OR OFF.

I'LL GO $100,000
FOR 40%.

00:30:15,782 --> 00:30:18,585
THE COMPANY
ISN'T WORTH $500,000.

00:30:18,585 --> 00:30:21,588
YEAH, BUT THE COMPANY'S SCALING
FAIRLY QUICKLY WITH NO HELP.

00:30:21,588 --> 00:30:23,023
WOULD YOU DO 30%?

00:30:28,962 --> 00:30:31,064
NO, IT'S NOT WORTH IT
FOR ME.

00:30:31,064 --> 00:30:32,632
I'M SORRY.

00:30:32,632 --> 00:30:33,733
THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT
THE SHARK TANK.

00:30:33,733 --> 00:30:35,035
THEY DO.

00:30:35,035 --> 00:30:37,003
THAT'S WHY YOU DIDN'T HAVE
ENOUGH MEAT ON THE BONE

00:30:37,003 --> 00:30:38,638
TO PROVE ITS VALUE.

00:30:38,638 --> 00:30:39,773

WHAT DOES
"BELLO VERDE" MEAN?

00:33:27,367 --> 00:33:29,369
IT MEANS "BEAUTIFUL GREEN"
IN ITALIAN.

00:33:29,369 --> 00:33:30,603

FOR 10 YEARS.

FROM SALES TO MANAGEMENT.

00:33:41,681 --> 00:33:43,449
I HAVEN'T HEARD
OF THAT BRAND.

THAT I DON'T HAVE TO
GO RUN AROUND AND LOOK FOR.

I WANT MY SALESPERSON
TO BE ABLE TO TELL ME,

"HEY, LOOK,

00:34:17,684 --> 00:34:20,720
SO, JOE BASICALLY
IS ALSO KIND OF YOUR STYLIST.

00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,854
YOU TRUST HIM?
YES.

00:34:21,854 --> 00:34:23,690
DO YOU GO TO SOMEONE'S HOME --
SO, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU SAID,

"I DON'T EVEN LIKE
GOING TO THE STORE."

00:34:25,558 --> 00:34:27,560

WERE DIRECT AGENT --

00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:30,830
FORGET THEIR MODEL.
TELL US ABOUT <i>YOUR</i> MODEL.

00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:33,399
WELL, IT'S KIND OF IMPORTANT.
IT'S KIND OF IMPORTANT.

00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:35,468
I WOULDN'T BE BORING YOU
WITH THE OLD-NEWS COMPANY

00:34:35,468 --> 00:34:36,502
IF IT WASN'T IMPORTANT
TO MY STORY.

00:34:36,502 --> 00:34:38,371

THERE'S SOMETHING GOOD.

00:34:38,371 --> 00:34:39,706

00:34:39,706 --> 00:34:41,541
OKAY, SO, THINGS WERE TOUGH
WHEN I LEFT.

00:34:41,541 --> 00:34:43,509
WHEN I LEFT, I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS GONNA DO.

00:34:43,509 --> 00:34:44,744
I DECIDED
TO OPEN UP BELLO VERDE.

00:34:44,744 --> 00:34:47,413
I WAS VERY FORTUNATE --
ASTOR &amp; BLACK WENT UNDER,

00:34:47,413 --> 00:34:49,482
AND I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY
TO DO SOMETHING

00:34:49,482 --> 00:34:50,783
WHICH WOULD PUT ME
AT THE NEXT LEVEL.

00:34:50,783 --> 00:34:52,585
WHAT?
WHAT DID YOU DO?

00:34:52,585 --> 00:34:54,487
DEAN, URIJAH,
SHOW THEM WHAT WE GOT!

00:34:54,487 --> 00:34:55,822
BOOM!

00:34:55,822 --> 00:34:57,824
I BOUGHT THAT COMPANY.

00:34:57,824 --> 00:34:59,592
SO I OWN BOTH --

00:34:59,592 --> 00:35:00,760
WHAT DID YOU
BUY IT FOR?

00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,662
I BOUGHT IT FOR $405,000.

00:35:02,662 --> 00:35:04,530
WHAT OTHER ASSETS DID YOU GET
FOR THE $405,000?

00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:07,500
I GOT OVER $1 MILLION
IN BELTS, SHOES,

00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,635
GOT IT, GOT IT.
SWEATERS, JEANS, TIES.

00:35:09,635 --> 00:35:10,770
HOW MUCH CASH
ARE YOU GONNA MAKE?

00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,505
SO, $1 MILLION
IN INVENTORY AND BELTS.
YES.

00:35:12,505 --> 00:35:13,840
WHAT ELSE?
OVER $1 MILLION INVENTORY.

00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,742
WE GOT A BACK-END WEB SYSTEM

00:35:15,742 --> 00:35:18,444
THAT'S WORTH
OVER 3/4 OF $1 MILLION.

00:35:18,444 --> 00:35:21,381
IT TIES OUR FACTORIES
TO OUR SALES AGENTS.

00:35:21,381 --> 00:35:22,515
IT'S A CUSTOM SERVICE,

00:35:22,515 --> 00:35:23,883
SO IF DEAN WANTS
SOMEBODY TO COME TO HIS HOME,

00:35:23,883 --> 00:35:25,651
WHATEVER THE REP IS
IN THAT REGION

00:35:25,651 --> 00:35:27,820
GOES TO HIS HOME
AND FITS HIM.

00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:30,523
THAT IS WHAT ASTOR &amp; BLACK
OF THE PAST DID.

00:35:30,523 --> 00:35:32,759
I HAVE A DIFFERENT IDEA.
WHAT'S YOUR IDEA?

00:35:32,759 --> 00:35:33,793
THAT'S GONNA BE ONE OF FOUR
OF MY REVENUE STREAMS.

00:35:33,793 --> 00:35:34,794
WHAT IS YOUR IDEA?
WHAT'S YOUR IDEA?

00:35:34,794 --> 00:35:36,562
THE OTHER THREE
REVENUE STREAMS --

00:35:36,562 --> 00:35:38,798
THE FIRST ONE
IS GOING TO BE ONLINE SALES.

00:35:38,798 --> 00:35:41,634
WE'VE ALREADY DEVELOPED
AND LAUNCHED AN ONLINE STORE

00:35:41,634 --> 00:35:44,537
FOR ACCESSORIES -- SHOES, BELTS,
SWEATERS, TIES, ALL THE ABOVE.

00:35:44,537 --> 00:35:46,539
NO, I GOT IT.
WHAT'S THE OTHER MODEL?

00:35:46,539 --> 00:35:48,708
THE OTHER MODEL
IS THERE ARE COMPANIES OUT THERE

00:35:48,708 --> 00:35:50,576
THAT HAVE DEVELOPED
ALGORITHMS.

00:35:50,576 --> 00:35:54,480
THESE ALGORITHMS CAN TAKE
BASIC QUESTIONS FROM A CONSUMER

00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,583
AND SPIT OUT AND PRINT OUT
A SET OF MEASUREMENTS.

00:35:57,583 --> 00:35:59,485
YEAH, ONE OF MY COMPANIES
IS FASHION METRIC,

00:35:59,485 --> 00:36:00,753
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT THEY DO.

00:36:00,753 --> 00:36:03,423
AND I'VE SPOKEN TO THE C.E.O.
AND C.O.O. OF FASHION METRIC...

00:36:03,423 --> 00:36:04,724
JOE, IS IT TRUE --

00:36:04,724 --> 00:36:06,492
...ABOUT INCORPORATING
THAT TECHNOLOGY...

00:36:06,492 --> 00:36:08,394
THEY WILL HELP YOU.
JOE, THROW ME
A BONE HERE.

00:36:08,394 --> 00:36:10,797
I ONLY HAVE ONE SIMPLE QUESTION,
VERY IMPORTANT.
YES.

00:36:10,797 --> 00:36:14,400
THIS COMPANY THAT YOU BOUGHT
FOR $405,000 --

00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,836
HOW MUCH CASH
WILL IT MAKE THIS YEAR?

00:36:16,836 --> 00:36:18,704
HOW MUCH CASH DO <i>YOU</i> THINK
IT'LL MAKE THIS YEAR?

00:36:18,704 --> 00:36:20,740
YOU MEAN
<i>I</i> HAVE TO ANSWER THAT?

00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:24,510
WHAT,
ARE YOU AN IDIOT?
I WAS GONNA ASK YOUR QUESTION
FOR YOU.

00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,412
YOU TELL <i>ME.</i>
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

00:36:26,412 --> 00:36:28,614
NO, HE JUST WANTS TO TAKE
YOU OUT BEHIND THE BARN
AND SHOOT YOU. THAT'S ALL.

00:36:28,614 --> 00:36:29,715
I'M ASKING YOU
AS AN INVESTOR,

00:36:29,715 --> 00:36:31,417
AND YOU'RE TELLING ME
I SHOULD KNOW?

00:36:31,417 --> 00:36:32,485
NO, NO,
I'M JUST ASKING --

00:36:32,485 --> 00:36:33,653
JOE,
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?

00:36:33,653 --> 00:36:34,754
MY SALES THIS YEAR
WILL BE $2 MILLION.

00:36:34,754 --> 00:36:38,624
ON THE $2 MILLION,
WE'LL NET OVER $500,000.

00:36:38,624 --> 00:36:40,593
AND, SO, WHAT'S THE COST
OF AN AVERAGE SUIT?

00:36:40,593 --> 00:36:42,762
WE TOP OUT IN
THE $2,500-TO-$3,000 SUIT RANGE,

00:36:42,762 --> 00:36:44,664
BUT OUR
BREAD-AND-BUTTER BUSINESS

00:36:44,664 --> 00:36:46,532
IS THAT
$1,000-TO-$1,500 SUIT.

00:36:46,532 --> 00:36:49,669
ASTOR &amp; BLACK
DEFINITELY IS RECOGNIZABLE.

00:36:49,669 --> 00:36:51,404
WHY NOW TWO NAMES?

00:36:51,404 --> 00:36:52,705
THE REASON WHY IT'S GREAT
THAT WE HAVE TWO

00:36:52,705 --> 00:36:55,408
IS BECAUSE
NOW WE CAN POSITION THEM --

00:36:55,408 --> 00:36:56,809
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
HOLD ON. LET ME FINISH.

00:36:56,809 --> 00:36:58,578
LET ME FINISH TELLING YOU
WHAT I WANT TO DO.

00:36:58,578 --> 00:36:59,645
YEAH, YOU CAN,
BUT IT'S A HEADACHE.

00:36:59,645 --> 00:37:00,746
LET ME TELL YOU MY PLAN.
TWO BRANDS.

00:37:00,746 --> 00:37:01,881
THE FIRST ONE IS RETAIL.

00:37:01,881 --> 00:37:03,516
ASTOR &amp; BLACK NEVER PUT IN

00:37:03,516 --> 00:37:04,784
A SINGLE DOLLAR OF SALES
FOR RETAIL.

00:37:04,784 --> 00:37:06,552
YOU WANT TO BE IN RETAIL?
Herjavec: SO,
YOU'RE GONNA GO RETAIL, JOE?

00:37:06,552 --> 00:37:07,653
OOH.

00:37:07,653 --> 00:37:09,655
I'M GOING TO PERHAPS
GIVE IT THE CONSIDERATION,

00:37:09,655 --> 00:37:10,656
WITH ONE OF YOUR HELP.

00:37:10,656 --> 00:37:12,692
THE OTHER TWO --
WHOLESALE.

00:37:12,692 --> 00:37:14,527
I'M GONNA OPEN UP
A WHOLESALE STREAM

00:37:14,527 --> 00:37:17,697
TO SELL THIS PRODUCT
TO OTHER PEOPLE IN THE BUSINESS.

00:37:17,697 --> 00:37:19,565
JOE, I ACTUALLY USE
ONE OF YOUR COMPETITORS.

00:37:19,565 --> 00:37:21,634
THAT'S WHY
I LOOK SO FABULOUS.

00:37:21,634 --> 00:37:23,603
EVERYTHING IS MADE
BY MY TAILOR.
I KNOW EXACTLY WHO YOU USE.
I KNOW EXACTLY WHO YOU USE.

00:37:23,603 --> 00:37:24,804
OKAY,
SO, HERE'S THE PROBLEM

00:37:24,804 --> 00:37:27,607
THAT I LOOK AT AS A DISCIPLINED
FINANCIAL INVESTOR.

00:37:27,607 --> 00:37:28,741
SURE.

00:37:28,741 --> 00:37:31,611
YOU'VE COME IN HERE AND SAID,
"I'LL MAKE $500,000,"

00:37:31,611 --> 00:37:33,479
AND YET YOU PRICED IT
AT 12 TIMES.

00:37:33,479 --> 00:37:34,680
SURE.

00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,582
I'M JUST LOOKING
AT YOUR VALUATION

00:37:36,582 --> 00:37:38,818
AND SAYING TO MYSELF,
"YOU'RE SO FAR FROM REALITY,"

00:37:38,818 --> 00:37:41,487
AND FOR THAT REASON,
JUST SO I CAN MAKE IT EASY

00:37:41,487 --> 00:37:43,723
FOR DAYMOND TO BEAT YOU
WITH A STICK IN A MINUTE,

00:37:43,723 --> 00:37:44,824
I'M OUT.

00:37:44,824 --> 00:37:47,393
OKAY. NO PROBLEM.
AND I APPRECIATE IT, KEVIN.

00:37:47,393 --> 00:37:49,529
I REALLY DO.
I APPRECIATE IT.

00:37:49,529 --> 00:37:52,598
I SHOULD NOT BE IN
THE MEN'S CUSTOM-SUIT BUSINESS.

00:37:52,598 --> 00:37:53,666
SO I'M OUT.

00:37:53,666 --> 00:37:56,602
I APPRECIATE IT, LORI.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:37:56,602 --> 00:37:58,471
JOE,
HERE'S THE CHALLENGE.

00:37:58,471 --> 00:38:00,840
THERE ARE GUYS LIKE KEVIN
WHO LOVE CUSTOM SUITS,

00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,442
THAT HAVE FUNNY BODIES,
WEIRD SHAPES.

00:38:03,442 --> 00:38:05,578
ADONIS BODIES
REQUIRE A TAILOR.

00:38:05,578 --> 00:38:07,547
I CAN THROW A DART

00:38:07,547 --> 00:38:10,783
AND I CAN FIND IN TORONTO,
NEW YORK, L.A., BOSTON

00:38:10,783 --> 00:38:13,686
HUNDREDS
OF CUSTOM TAILORS.

00:38:13,686 --> 00:38:15,788
IT IS REALLY
A BRANDING EXERCISE.

00:38:15,788 --> 00:38:18,624
I ALSO FIND THE DUAL-NAME
STRATEGY CONFUSING.

00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:20,393
I THINK,
WHEN YOU'RE SMALL,

00:38:20,393 --> 00:38:22,795
YOU GOT TO BE REALLY
LASER-LIKE FOCUSED, RIGHT?

00:38:22,795 --> 00:38:24,463
SURE.

00:38:24,463 --> 00:38:25,831
I THINK GOING TO MARKET
WITH TWO BRANDS LIKE THIS,

00:38:25,831 --> 00:38:27,733
I MEAN,
IT'S JUST CONFUSING.

00:38:27,733 --> 00:38:29,368
I'M OUT.

00:38:29,368 --> 00:38:30,403
I APPRECIATE IT.

00:38:31,604 --> 00:38:33,472
YOU'VE GOT
MARK AND DAYMOND LEFT.
TWO SHARKS LEFT.

00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,373
TWO SHARKS LEFT.

00:38:35,374 --> 00:38:36,709
WHEN I FIRST SOLD
broadcast.com

00:38:36,709 --> 00:38:38,477
AND I WAS WORTH
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS,

00:38:38,477 --> 00:38:40,580
AND I FIGURED, "YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA GO DRESS UP,"

00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:43,816
AND SO I WENT
TO OUR LOCAL CUSTOM GUY,

00:38:43,816 --> 00:38:45,484
AND "OKAY,
LET'S DO IT UP RIGHT."

00:38:45,484 --> 00:38:47,520
SO, LITERALLY,
I SPENT $95,000

00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,823
AND GOT, LIKE, 19 SUITS,
AND I THOUGHT --

00:38:50,823 --> 00:38:51,891
COME ON!

00:38:51,891 --> 00:38:53,392
YOU NEVER
WORE THEM ONCE.

00:38:53,392 --> 00:38:54,460
I'VE WORN THREE OF THEM.

00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:54,894
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:38:54,894 --> 00:38:56,495
AS FAR AS YOUR STRATEGY,

00:38:56,495 --> 00:38:58,497
I THINK
YOU'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING.

00:38:58,497 --> 00:39:00,766
YOU WERE ABLE TO BUY $1 MILLION
IN INVENTORY FOR $400,000,

00:39:00,766 --> 00:39:04,470
GET THE BACK OFFICE,
GET THE ONLINE.

00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:07,573
THE REAL ISSUE
IS THAT THE WAY YOU'VE PRICED IT

00:39:07,573 --> 00:39:09,842
AT A $6 MILLION VALUATION,

00:39:09,842 --> 00:39:11,844
YOU LITERALLY
HAVE TO GROW 10 TIMES

00:39:11,844 --> 00:39:13,813
BEFORE YOU CAN
REALLY BE A PLAYER

00:39:13,813 --> 00:39:16,415
FOR ME TO GET A RETURN
ON MY INVESTMENT.

00:39:16,415 --> 00:39:18,417
WELL, WHAT WOULD YOU THINK
IS MORE FAIR OF A NUMBER?

00:39:18,417 --> 00:39:19,685
REGARDLESS,
YOU STILL HAVE TO GROW

00:39:19,685 --> 00:39:21,654
TO GET TO THAT POINT
WHERE YOU ARE REALLY --

00:39:21,654 --> 00:39:22,822
WE'RE <i>GONNA</i> GROW.
WE'RE DOUBLING NEXT YEAR.

00:39:22,822 --> 00:39:25,391
I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO DO --
JOE. JOE.

00:39:25,391 --> 00:39:26,425
JOE! SHH!

00:39:27,393 --> 00:39:28,494
WE KNOW.

00:39:28,494 --> 00:39:30,830
YOU'RE A GOOD SALESPERSON.
YOU'RE DOING A GOOD JOB.

00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:32,832
AND YOU'RE GONNA GO FAR
WITH THIS COMPANY.

00:39:32,832 --> 00:39:34,467
BUT AS AN INVESTOR,

00:39:34,467 --> 00:39:37,436
I DON'T THINK THE REWARD
IS THERE RELATIVE TO THE RISK.

00:39:38,704 --> 00:39:39,705
I'M OUT.

00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,608
FAIR ENOUGH.

00:39:42,608 --> 00:39:44,443
OKAY, JOE, GET FOCUSED.
THERE'S ONLY ONE SHARK LEFT.

00:39:45,711 --> 00:39:47,580
OKAY, BIG "D,"
WHATCHA GONNA DO?

00:39:50,616 --> 00:39:51,784
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER,

00:39:51,784 --> 00:39:54,520
AND IT'S GONNA BE SO SWEET,
IT'S GONNA GIVE YOU A CAVITY.

00:40:05,564 --> 00:40:07,600
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER,

00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,835
AND IT'S GONNA BE SO SWEET,
IT'S GONNA GIVE YOU A CAVITY.

00:40:09,835 --> 00:40:10,836
NOW...

00:40:10,836 --> 00:40:12,505
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:40:12,505 --> 00:40:13,739
I BET IT'S GONNA BE
VERY PAINFUL.

00:40:13,739 --> 00:40:14,774
OH.

00:40:14,774 --> 00:40:18,644
YOU ASKED FOR $360,000
FOR 6%.

00:40:18,644 --> 00:40:22,782
I WILL GIVE YOU $360,000
FOR 33%.

00:40:22,782 --> 00:40:23,749
[ LAUGHS ]

00:40:23,749 --> 00:40:24,784
OHHHHH!

00:40:24,784 --> 00:40:26,585
O'Leary:
OKAY, MR. LEPRECHAUN.

00:40:26,585 --> 00:40:28,421
YOU'VE JUST BEEN OFFERED
A POT OF GOLD.

00:40:28,421 --> 00:40:29,655
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

00:40:29,655 --> 00:40:31,424
Chay: THAT IS A NUMBER

00:40:31,424 --> 00:40:33,592
THAT IS SO FAR OFF
FROM WHAT I WOULD ACCEPT

00:40:33,592 --> 00:40:35,695
THAT IT'S PROBABLY
NOT EVEN A GOOD IDEA

00:40:35,695 --> 00:40:37,396
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION
ABOUT IT.

00:40:37,396 --> 00:40:38,531
MAKE A COUNTER.

00:40:38,531 --> 00:40:42,735
I MEAN, MY COUNTEROFFER
WOULD BE $360,000 FOR 7%.

A LOT OF ROOM TO MOVE.

00:40:45,805 --> 00:40:47,807
IF YOU WOULD LIKE
TO COUNTER WITH SOMETHING

00:40:47,807 --> 00:40:49,442
THAT'S SOMEWHERE
REALISTIC...

00:40:49,442 --> 00:40:51,777
MY BOTTOM LINE
IS $360,000 --

00:40:51,777 --> 00:40:53,479
AND IF I DID THIS,
BY THE WAY,

00:40:53,479 --> 00:40:54,880
TELL US.
IT WOULD BE INSULTING
TO THE OTHER --

00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,483
GET IT OUT!
WHAT IS IT?!

00:40:57,483 --> 00:41:00,786
$360,000
FOR 8% OF THE COMPANY.

00:41:00,786 --> 00:41:03,589
THAT IS MY BOTTOM LINE.

00:41:03,589 --> 00:41:05,391
IT'S GONNA GET REALLY UGLY
IN A MINUTE.

00:41:05,391 --> 00:41:06,492
NO, I DON'T THINK IT IS.
IT IS. YEAH.

IT'S HILARIOUS.

WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,

00:41:09,395 --> 00:41:12,732
I WILL GIVE YOU

IS WORTH AS MUCH AS I --
