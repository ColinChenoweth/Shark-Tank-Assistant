WELCOME TO THE SHARK TANK,

00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:05,205
WHERE ENTREPRENEURS
SEEK AN INVESTMENT

00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:08,108
TO START, GROW, OR SAVE
THEIR BUSINESS.

<i>"POURQUOI PAS L'EAU D'AMANDE?"</i>

PERFECT!

Narrator: IF THE SHARKS HEAR
A GREAT IDEA...

00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:15,949
WHAT'S DIRTIER -- YOUR CELLPHONE
OR A PUBLIC TOILET?

00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,217
DISGUSTING.

00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:19,119
Narrator: ...THEY'LL INVEST
THEIR OWN MONEY

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,321
AND FIGHT EACH OTHER
FOR A DEAL.

00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:23,323
LORI, WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU CREATED A SALES FORCE?

00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:25,025
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I DO.

00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:28,262
BUT THE ENTREPRENEURS
MUST GET THE FULL AMOUNT

00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:31,298
THEY'RE ASKING FOR, OR THEY'LL
WALK AWAY WITH NOTHING.

00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:32,432
THIS IS NOT
A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.

00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:34,334
NO, BUT IT'S JUST --
IT'S DIFFERENT.

00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:35,402
IT'S STILL A RIP-OFF.

00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:37,437
I SMELL JAIL TIME.

DAVID AND I GREW UP TOGETHER
IN PARIS.

00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,209
OUR PARENTS
WERE BEST FRIENDS.

00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,044
WE WENT TO
THE SAME HIGH SCHOOL.

00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,212
EVEN THOUGH
WE STARTED AS FRIENDS,

00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:55,282
I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN, DEEP DOWN,
THAT WE WOULD END UP TOGETHER.

00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,984
WE'RE MADE
FOR EACH OTHER.

00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:59,219
SHE'S COOKING IN THIS ONE.
SHE'S PROBABLY MAKING IT.

00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,022
MY GRANDMOTHER VICTORIA
USED TO MAKE OUR PRODUCT

00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:03,290
IN HER KITCHEN,
AND EVERY SUNDAY,

00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,192
WE WOULD GO TO HER HOUSE
AND CONSUME IT.

[ CHUCKLES ]
<i>ALORS, ALORS!</i>

00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,063
WE MADE OUR PRODUCT FOR
OUR FRIENDS WHEN THEY CAME OVER.

00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,198
THEY LOVED IT SO MUCH,

00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:14,167
THEY KEPT ASKING US TO MAKE MORE
FOR THEM TO TAKE HOME.

00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:16,036
AND, <i>VOILà,</i>
OUR PRODUCT WAS BORN,

00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:17,304
AND WE OWE IT ALL
TO GRANDMA.

CHEERS.
CHEERS.

00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:21,008
David: IN THE FOOD-AND-BEVERAGE
INDUSTRY,

00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:22,142
THE COMPETITORS
ARE REALLY BIG.

00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,344
AND BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE
THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES

00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:25,946
THE BIG PLAYERS HAVE,

00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:27,280
WE HAVE TO BE INNOVATIVE
TO MAKE IT WORK.

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,149
WE RISKED EVERYTHING
FOR THE BUSINESS.

00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,019
WE INVESTED
ALL OUR LIFE SAVINGS,

00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:33,186
AND WE BOTH QUIT OUR JOBS.

00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:36,189
IT'S MY GRANDMOTHER'S NAME,
IT'S MY GRANDMOTHER'S FACE,

00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:39,359
IT'S OUR ENTIRE LIVES,
SO I REALLY NEED IT TO SUCCEED.

00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:56,943
HELLO, SHARKS.

00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:59,112

WE'RE FROM PARIS, FRANCE,

AND WE'RE THE FOUNDERS
OF VICTORIA'S KITCHEN.

00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:05,452
TODAY WE'RE SEEKING
AN INVESTMENT OF $200,000

00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:08,021
IN EXCHANGE FOR 20% EQUITY
IN OUR COMPANY.

00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,058
SO, I'M SURE MANY OF YOU
GREW UP WITH A GRANDMOTHER

00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:12,259
WHO LIKED TO COOK,
RIGHT?

00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:14,361
AND MY GRANDMOTHER VICTORIA
IS NO EXCEPTION.

00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,329
BUT UNLIKE
AMERICAN GRANDMOTHERS

00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,465
WHO LIKE TO MAKE LEMONADE
OR SWEET ICED TEA,

00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,400
SHE MAKES
AN AMAZING ALMOND WATER.

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,203
IT'S LIGHT, IT'S CRISP,
AND IT'S SO REFRESHING.

00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,039
SO, WHEN DAVID AND I
MOVED TO THE U.S.,

00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,408
WE PACKED THIS ONE-OF-A-KIND
FRENCH RECIPE WITH US.

00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,043
WE STARTED MAKING IT,

00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,012
AND OUR FRIENDS
COULD NOT GET ENOUGH OF IT.

00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:34,347
WE HAD ALWAYS WANTED
TO START A BUSINESS TOGETHER,

00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:37,084
SO ONE DAY, WE LOOKED
AT EACH OTHER AND WE SAID...

00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:38,985
Both:
<i>"POURQUOI PAS L'EAU D'AMANDE?"</i>

00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,253
"WHY NOT ALMOND WATER?"

00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:42,322
[ LAUGHS ]
OUR ALMOND WATER
IS ALL-NATURAL,

00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:47,227
VEGAN, SOY-FREE, DAIRY-FREE,
GMO-FREE, GLUTEN-FREE,

00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,229
BUT MOST OF ALL,
IT IS THAT PERFECT TREAT

00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,164
THAT WILL MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE LOUNGING

00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:54,201
IN THE FRESHLY CUT GRASS
IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE.

00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:56,136
SO, WHO'S READY
TO STEP INTO...

00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:57,337
Both:
VICTORIA'S KITCHEN...

00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:58,371
...AND JOIN OUR FAMILY?

00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,273
CAN WE TRY IT?
OF COURSE.

00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:03,009
HOW MANY CALORIES
PER BOTTLE?

00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:06,413
SO, THE ORIGINAL HAS
110 CALORIES PER BOTTLE.

00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:09,216
THAT'S IT?
THE COCONUT HAS
100 CALORIES PER BOTTLE.

00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:10,450
SO, WE HAVE TWO FLAVORS.

00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,185
ALMOND WATER ORIGINAL
IS THE COMBINATION

00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,154
OF ALMOND, VANILLA,
AND ROSE.

00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:16,223
AND THEN WE HAVE
ALMOND AND COCONUT.

DAVID, IT'S FANTASTIC.
SERIOUSLY.
THANK YOU.

00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,432
IT'S VERY SWEET.
SO, IT'S BASED ON
MY GRANDMOTHER'S RECIPE.

00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,300
THAT'S YOUR GRANDMOTHER
IN THE PICTURE?

00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,236
THAT'S VICTORIA. SHE'S
ALL OVER THE PLACE WITH US.

00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:30,270
YES. [ CHUCKLES ]

00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,438
DAVID, TELL ME
ABOUT ALMOND WATER.

00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:34,107
IS THIS A COMMON DRINK
IN FRANCE?

00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,375
SO, IT'S VERY POPULAR
IN EUROPE --

00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,344
IN ITALY, IN SICILY,
IN GREECE, IN TURKEY...

00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:39,012
SEE IF YOU WANT
THIS ONE.

00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,313
...IN MIDDLE EASTERN
COUNTRIES.

00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:43,016
WAS IT A SPECIALTY DRINK,
LIKE A DESSERT THING?

00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:45,018
IT'S A FAMILY DRINK.
IT'S A PICNIC DRINK.

00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:46,219
YOU KNOW,
I GO TO MY GRANDMOTHER'S,

00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,989
SHE MAKES APPLE CAKE
AND ALMOND WATER.

00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:50,390
THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE
WE HAVE IN THE SHARK TANK

00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,994
WITH ALL OF THE BEVERAGE DEALS
THAT COMES IN HERE,

00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:56,196
IN THE END, DISTRIBUTION SEEMS
TO BE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE --

00:04:56,196 --> 00:05:00,066
GETTING SHELF SPACE AWAY
FROM GIANT COMPANIES WHO OWN IT.

00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,068
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE THERE?
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?

00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,404
FIRST YEAR --
$160,000.

00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:05,405
OKAY.

00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,374
SECOND YEAR --
$330,000.

00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,176
AND THIR--
AND WE'RE
IN OUR THIRD YEAR.

00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:10,977
RIGHT NOW,
WE'RE AT ABOUT $210,000,

00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,245
$220,000
FOR 8 MONTHS.

00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,181
AND, DAVID, HOW ARE SELLING IT?
WHAT STORES?

00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:17,150
SO, WE SELL MOSTLY TO NATURAL
AND SPECIALTY FOOD STORES

00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,419
AND INDEPENDENT GROCERY STORES
FOR 60 CENTS,

00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:22,489
AND THEN I SELL IT FOR $1.10.
IT'S 45% MARGIN.

00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,224
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
IN AMERICA?

00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:25,992
14 YEARS? YEAH.
14 YEARS, YES.

00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,460
SO, I MOVED OUT HERE,
I WAS 17 YEARS OLD,

00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,296
DIDN'T SPEAK
A WORD OF ENGLISH,

00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:32,065
AND MY DREAM WAS,
"LET ME CREATE SOMETHING.

00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,967
LET ME START SOME--
SOMETHING FROM SCRATCH."

00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:36,002
SO, I HAD
A HIGH-PAYING JOB BEFORE,

00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,304
AND I LEFT
TO DO THIS FULL TIME.

00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:40,173
WE WANTED TO BUILD A BUSINESS,
SO WE TOOK ALL OUR SAVINGS

00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,042
AND WE INVESTED IT
IN VICTORIA'S KITCHEN.

00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,144
HOW MUCH?
ABOUT $250,000...

00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:45,979
WOW.
...WHICH IS EVERYTHING
WE HAD, SO --

00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:47,047
THAT'S ALL IN.
THAT'S ALL IN.

00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:48,281
ALL IN. IT'S ALL IN.
IT'S ALL IN. YEAH.

00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:50,116
LOOK -- LOOK,
I JUST -- I WANT TO GO BACK --

00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,052
HOW MANY STORES ARE YOU IN?
I'M JUST CURIOUS.

00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:53,086
ABOUT 800?
ABOUT 800.

00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,120
NATIONWIDE. YEAH.

00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,255
NAME A COUPLE?
DO YOU HAVE WHOLE FOODS?

00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:56,389
WHOLE FOOD,
NEW SEASONS...

00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,158
OH, YOU DO?
...ANDRONICO'S, LUNARDI'S.

00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:00,060
WHOLE FOODS IS NOT REALLY
OUR TARGET MARKET.

00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,294
WHY?
WHY?
WHY?
WHY?

00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,096
IT SEEMS PERFECT.
I WOULD THINK
IT'S PERFECT.

00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,031
BECAUSE --
IT'S -- IT'S ACTUALLY
NOT THAT PERFECT

00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,099
BECAUSE IT'S A REALLY --

00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,167
IT'S A MARKET THAT'S
REALLY TARGETED ON HEALTH --

00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:08,134
MEANING, IT'S NOT --

00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,236
BECAUSE IT HAS
15 GRAMS OF SUGAR.

00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:10,270
EVERYTHING ELSE
IS FUNCTIONAL.

00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,438
IT DOESN'T HAVE
A VITAMIN.

00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:13,240
IT'S NOT GONNA MAKE YOU GROW
WINGS OR, YOU KNOW, RUN FASTER.

00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,407
WELL, NO. NO, BUT COME ON.

00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,943
NO, NO, REALLY, IT COMES DOWN
TO THE SUGAR, RIGHT?

00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,378
HOW MANY GRAMS OF SUGAR
IS IN A SODA,

00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,280
AS OPPOSED TO ONE OF THESE?

00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,382
IT COULD GO DOUBLE.
I'LL GIVE YOU --
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.

00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:26,086
UM, THE TOP-SELLING LEMONADE
IN THE UNITED STATES,

00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:28,455
THERE IS 56 GRAMS OF SUGAR
IN 16 OUNCES.

00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:32,058
YEAH, BUT BETTER -- BETTER
THAN BAD DOESN'T MAKE IT GOOD.

00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,426
NO, BUT IT'S JUST --
IT'S DIFFERENT.

00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:34,995
WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP?

00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:36,363
THERE'S A FEW WAYS
WE CAN GROW THE COMPANY.

00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:38,999
ONE WAY
IS ADDING MORE SKUs.

00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:40,133
SECOND --
MEANING, ADDING --

00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,434
ADDING MORE FLAVORS
AND MORE PRODUCTS.

00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:44,204
HOW ABOUT MORE STORES?
HOW ARE YOU GONNA DO THAT?

00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:46,239
YOU KNOW WHAT?
BEFORE GETTING TO MORE STORES,

00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,174

THAT MEANS YOUR SALES --

WITH ROUGHLY $280,000,

GONE DOWN SO MUCH?

THIS YEAR.

AND BREAKS DOWN
INTO FOUR STURDY PLATES.

00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:43,389
THIS ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR
ADDITIONAL DISPOSABLE PLATES,

00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:46,059
AND IT NEGATES THE NEED
FOR CLEANING UP,

00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:48,127
WHICH NO ONE EVER ENJOYS.

FOLDS INTO A HANDY STORAGE
CONTAINER FOR LEFTOVERS.

AND PLASTIC WRAP.

NOT AS CREATIVE, ACTUALLY --

AND IT WAS ONLY GOING TO BE
A FRACTION OF A PENNY.

00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,341
AND GEORGE, THE ACCOUNTANT,
SAID TO ME,

00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:46,979
"IS IT GOING TO HELP ME SELL
ONE MORE PIZZA?"

IT'S ALL ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT.

WOW.

00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,402
THE GrooveBook BRAND
HAS GROWN IN WAYS

00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:45,204
WE COULD HAVE

00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:47,106

ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT.
LET'S DO IT.

00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:50,142
Brian: WHEN WE PITCHED
ON "SHARK TANK,"

00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,377
WE BARELY HAD ANY SALES.

00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:53,312

Housenbold: ALL RIGHT.
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,185
THE GrooveBook DEAL
IS THE LARGEST DEAL EVER

00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:01,153
IN "SHARK TANK" HISTORY.

00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:05,224
IT'S A DREAM COME TRUE, AND
I FEEL WARM AND FUZZY INSIDE.

00:22:05,224 --> 00:22:08,227
AND I'M HERE NOW
WITH SHARK KEVIN O'LEARY.

00:22:08,227 --> 00:22:09,361
I GUESS I SHOULD SAY
CONGRATULATIONS.

00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:11,030
YOU SAW THIS ONE EARLY.

00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,098
WE JUST CLOSED THE BIGGEST DEAL
IN "SHARK TANK" HISTORY,

00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:15,100
AND I'M HERE ON THE SET
OF "GOOD MORNING AMERICA"

00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,402
TO TELL THE WHOLE WORLD
ABOUT IT.

00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:19,038
EVEN YOU COULDN'T HAVE PREDICTED
THIS KIND OF BREAKOUT SUCCESS.

00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:22,041
NO, BUT IT TAUGHT ALL OF US
WHAT A PLATFORM "SHARK TANK" IS.

00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:24,343
THIS YOUNG FAMILY
HAS JUST PROVEN

00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,212
THE AMERICAN DREAM
IS STILL ALIVE.

00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:28,414
THIS HAS REALLY BEEN
LIFE-CHANGING FOR OUR FAMILY,

00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:31,283
AND WE'RE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD
TO SPENDING TIME WITH THEM

00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:33,018

Narrator: NEXT UP IS
WHAT THE ENTREPRENEUR BELIEVES

00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:51,736
IS A GAME CHANGER
IN REAL-ESTATE INVESTING.

00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,579
HI, SHARKS.

00:23:01,579 --> 00:23:03,548
MY NAME IS AARON McDANIEL,
FROM SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA,

00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,750
AND I'M THE C.E.O.
OF TYCOON REAL ESTATE.

00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:09,688
I'M SEEKING $50,000 IN EXCHANGE
FOR 5% OF MY COMPANY.

00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:10,855
FOR LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF YEARS,

00:23:10,855 --> 00:23:12,857
THE MOST PROVEN WAY
TO CONSISTENTLY BUILD WEALTH

00:23:12,857 --> 00:23:14,793
HAS BEEN THROUGH INVESTING
IN REAL ESTATE.

00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:18,430
UNFORTUNATELY, TRADITIONAL
REAL-ESTATE INVESTING

00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,832
IS DIFFICULT, INTIMIDATING,
AND EXPENSIVE.

00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,501
THE BEST DEALS ARE ONLY OFFERED
TO THE SUPERWEALTHY

00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:25,837
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS,
HELPING THE RICH GET RICHER

00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:27,672
AND LOCKING
THE REST OF US OUT.

00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:29,574
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?
[ LAUGHS ]

00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:32,544
NOW YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY
TO GET IN ON THE GROUND FLOOR

00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:33,678
OF AN EXCITING, NEW BUSINESS

00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:35,847
THAT WILL CHANGE
REAL-ESTATE INVESTING FOREVER.

00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:38,783
TYCOON REAL ESTATE
IS A CROWD-INVESTING PLATFORM

00:23:38,783 --> 00:23:41,553
THAT ALLOWS EVERYDAY PEOPLE
TO INVEST IN REAL ESTATE

00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:42,787
FOR AS LITTLE AS $1,000.

00:23:42,787 --> 00:23:44,589
I HATE IT. I'M OUT.

00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:46,858
Corcoran: WOW.

00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:48,793
I SMELL JAIL TIME.

00:23:48,793 --> 00:23:51,563
WOW, MARK.
THAT'S AGGRESSIVE.

00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:54,499
WHAT ABOUT YOU, BARBARA?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:56,668
I HAVEN'T EVEN FORMED
AN OPINION. KEEP GOING.

00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:58,503
SURE, YEAH. LET ME --
LET ME GO AHEAD AND FINISH MY --

00:23:58,503 --> 00:23:59,738
DON'T LET THAT
UNSETTLE YOU.

00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:01,673
SO, ALL OF OUR DEALS
ARE PROFESSIONALLY VETTED,

00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:03,541
ONLY WORKING
WITH TOP DEVELOPERS.

00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:05,744
AND IF THE FUNDING GOAL IS NOT
MET FOR A CERTAIN PROJECT,

00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,479
EVERYONE
GETS THEIR MONEY BACK.

00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:10,582
SO NOW YOU CAN GET 8 TO 10 TIMES
THE RETURN YOU COULD GET,

00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:12,784
COMPARED TO KEEPING YOUR MONEY
IN A SAVINGS ACCOUNT.

00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,452
SO, LET ME --
LET ME TALK YOU THROUGH

00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:15,553
A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT HOW IT WORKS.

00:24:15,553 --> 00:24:17,856
SO, FIRST,
WE GO TO TYCOON'S WEBSITE.

00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:19,624
ONCE YOU'RE HERE,
YOU CAN LOOK THROUGH

00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,493
OUR LIST
OF INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES.

00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:22,694
THERE ARE A VARIETY
OF DIFFERENT TYPES

00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:23,828
FROM RESIDENTIAL TO COMMERCIAL,

00:24:23,828 --> 00:24:26,498
EACH WITH THEIR OWN
UNIQUE INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES.

00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:30,869
SO, AS AN EXAMPLE, THIS ONE HERE
IS A MARQUEE RETAIL PROPERTY

00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:32,737
THAT'S PART OF A LARGE
COMMERCIAL COMPLEX

00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:34,672
JUST OUTSIDE
OF THE MANHATTAN AREA.

00:24:34,672 --> 00:24:35,807
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO

00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,475
IS ENTER THE AMOUNT OF MONEY
YOU'D LIKE TO INVEST,

00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:40,478
GO THROUGH
A SIMPLE ONLINE PROCESS,

00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:41,813
AND ONCE
THE INVESTMENT GOAL IS MET,

00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,715
YOU'RE A REAL-ESTATE INVESTOR.

00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:46,651
THEN YOU CAN SIT BACK
AND ENJOY THE PROFITS YOU GET

00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,554
FROM THE APPRECIATION AND
THE CASH FLOWS OF THE PROPERTY.

00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:52,757
SO, SHARKS, WE'RE ON THE BRINK
OF AN EXCITING, NEW ERA

00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:57,429
WHERE LITERALLY ANYONE
CAN BE A REAL-ESTATE TYCOON.

00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:01,533
HOW DO I GET MY MONEY BACK?
HOW DO I GET THE RETURN?

00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:03,568
BOOM, BOOM, BOOM!
GIVE THE GUY A CIGAR!

00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:05,537
SO, I MEAN, ULTIMATELY,
THIS IS --

00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:07,539
THIS IS A BUSINESS TO SCALE
IN A BIG WAY.

00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:08,773
BUT WALK ME THROUGH
A SINGLE MODEL.
SURE.

00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:10,508
I INVEST IN THAT BUILDING
IN NEW JERSEY.

00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:11,843
I GIVE YOU $10,000.
SURE.

00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:15,513
I ASSUME I OWN
SOME PERCENTAGE OF IT.
THAT'S CORRECT.

00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:17,816
I ASSUME THAT BUILDING
IS TAKING ON SO MUCH RENT,

00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:19,717
I'M MAKING MONEY.
YES.

00:25:19,717 --> 00:25:21,619
THEN THE BUILDING
GETS SOLD ONE DAY.
MM-HMM.

00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:24,456
I'M ASSUMING I MAKE A RETURN
ON MY $10,000

00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:26,724
EQUAL TO MY VALUE
OF THE OVERALL BUILDING.
RIGHT, SO DEPENDING ON --

00:25:26,724 --> 00:25:29,427
WHO SETS THE VALUE
OF THE BUILDING

00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:30,662
AT THE TIME
THAT I INVEST?

00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:32,730
THE -- WHAT WE REFER TO
AS THE DEAL MAKER --

00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:35,400
THE DEVELOPER WHO IS LOOKING
TO RAISE MONEY FOR THE PROJECT.

00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,501
SO, THERE IS
A LEAD DEVELOPER

00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:37,602
THAT IS IN CHARGE
OF THE INVESTMENT?

00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:39,737
THAT'S CORRECT.
ARE YOU TAKING A FEE?

00:25:39,737 --> 00:25:41,473
SO, WHAT WE TAKE
IS A MANAGEMENT FEE,

00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:42,574
A TECHNOLOGY FEE,
SERVICE FEE.

00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:43,608
HOW MUCH IS THAT?
HOW ABOUT -- WHAT'S --

00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:45,777
1.25%
OF THE AMOUNT RAISED.

00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:46,878
HOW MANY
EXISTING BUILDINGS

00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,613
HAVE YOU ACTUALLY FUNDED
THIS WAY?

00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:50,515
ANSWER BARB'S QUESTION.
YEAH, I'M SORRY, BARBARA.

00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:51,749
'CAUSE SHE IS
THE REAL-ESTATE MAVEN.

00:25:51,749 --> 00:25:52,851
WE'VE DONE
TWO PROOF-OF-CONCEPT DEALS.

00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,586
FIRST,
WAS A TOTALLY CLOSED DEAL.

00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:55,820
AND WHAT WAS THE TOTAL RAISED
ON THAT DEAL?

00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,522
THAT WAS $100,000.

00:25:57,522 --> 00:25:59,657
WHAT WAS IT,
A GARAGE SPACE?
IT WAS A -- IT WAS A --

00:25:59,657 --> 00:26:02,794
IT WAS A -- IT WAS A PART
OF A HOUSE IN SAN FRANCISCO.

00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:03,895
<i>PART</i> OF A HOUSE?

00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,530
IT WAS --
IT WAS A PORTION OF THE --

00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:06,598
OF THE DEBT POSITION
IN A HOUSE.

00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:08,867
AND YOU CHARGED 1.25%
FOR THAT DEAL?

00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,602
UH, YES.

00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:12,470
LET'S SAY I WANT TO INVEST
IN REAL ESTATE.

00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,872
I CAN GO ONLINE
TO ONE OF THE BIG PLAYERS --

00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,474
FIDELITY OR SCHWAB --
I CAN BUY A REIT.

00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:17,842
A REIT IS A REAL-ESTATE
INVESTMENT TRUST...

00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:19,477
MM-HMM.

00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:22,447
...SO THAT PEOPLE CAN GET
DIVERSIFICATION IN REAL ESTATE.

00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:23,681
TOTAL LIQUIDITY.

00:26:23,681 --> 00:26:25,617
I CAN BUY AND SELL IT
ANY DAY I WANT.

00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:28,419
I'M GONNA
GET MY YIELD OF 4.5%.
MM-HMM.

00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:31,623
AND I HAVE 5,000 PROPERTIES
INSIDE THE REITs.

00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:32,724
REITs AREN'T SEXY.

00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:34,559
NOBODY BRAGS ABOUT REITs.

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,427
THAT'S SO HORRIBLE.
THAT IS SO HORRIBLE.

00:26:36,427 --> 00:26:37,662
Herjavec: BUT, AARON,
WHO CARES ABOUT SEXY

00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:39,564
WHEN IT COMES
TO SAVING MONEY?
THAT IS SO HORRIBLE.

00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:40,899
BECAU--
BECAUSE YOU TALK TO ANY --

00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:42,534
THAT IS WRONG
IN SO MANY WAYS.

00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:43,801
YOU TALK TO
ANY REAL-ESTATE INVESTOR,

00:26:43,801 --> 00:26:45,537
AND ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS
THEY TALK ABOUT INVESTING

00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:46,871
IS THAT PHYSICAL,
EMOTIONAL CONNECTION

00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:48,606
THEY HAVE TO THE BUILDING.

00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:50,475
I THINK PEOPLE HAVE A PHYSICAL
AND EMOTIONAL CONNECTION

00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:51,476
TO THEIR LIFE SAVINGS.

00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:54,612
I LOVE INVESTING
IN REAL ESTATE,

00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:57,715
BUT I RECOGNIZE
IT'S PURE LUCK.

00:26:57,715 --> 00:26:59,651
I-I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S TRUE.

00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,886
IF YOU CAN BUY
ALMOST ANY PIECE OF REAL ESTATE,

00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:04,656
YOU WILL MAKE MONEY
OVER 10 YEARS.

00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:05,690
MM-HMM.

00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,792
IF, DURING THAT TIME,
YOU NEED LIQUIDITY,

00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,627
YOU MAY LOSE
A LOT OF MONEY.

00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:13,598
I THINK WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH
PEOPLE'S LIFE SAVINGS --

00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:14,699
MM-HMM.

00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:15,767
...AND I THINK THIS ATTRACTS
THE KIND OF PERSON

00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:18,836
WHO WANTS A GREATER RETURN
FOR THEIR RETIREMENT --

00:27:18,836 --> 00:27:20,805
I THINK YOU GOT TO BE
CONSERVATIVE WITH YOUR MONEY.

00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:24,442
BE RISKY AT WORK,
BE SAFE WITH YOUR INVESTMENTS.

00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:25,610
A-AND TO THAT POINT,
T-THERE -- THERE'S AN --

00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,645
I'M OUT. I'M OUT.
OKAY.

00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:28,780
AND T-THERE -- AND THERE --

A CONSERVATIVE INVESTMENT.

TO TOUCH AND FEEL REAL ESTATE,

OUTLINED IS THAT AFTER A YEAR

FOR A MINUTE.

OF INVESTING IN REAL ESTATE

ONLINE WITH A BUNCH
OF OTHER PEOPLE I DON'T KNOW.

00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:27,572

RISKY AND UNCOMFORTABLE.

WHY YOU DON'T WANT TO,

WITH ALL YOUR PHONES.

00:34:09,513 --> 00:34:10,681
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE
ALREADY CHARGING YOUR PHONE,

00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:12,817
YOU MIGHT AS WELL CLEAN IT
AT THE SAME TIME.

00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:15,453
SO THERE'S --
I'M GONNA GUESS THAT THERE'S
NO PATENT YOU CAN GET ON THIS

00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:17,822
'CAUSE CLEANING DEVICES
OF THIS KIND ARE EVERYWHERE.

00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:19,690
SO, WE ACTUALLY HAVE
TWO UTILITY PATENTS SUBMITTED.

00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:22,626
I BET YOU
OUR AVERAGE PHONE HERE,

00:34:22,626 --> 00:34:25,496
IF YOU SWABBED IT,
WOULD BE DISGUSTING.

00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:28,833
THE AVERAGE CONSUMER
IS RELATIVELY LAZY,

00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:31,669
AND I'M NOT SURE THEY SEE THIS
AS A MAJOR ISSUE

00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:33,704
THAT THEY ARE WILLING
TO SPEND MONEY ON.

00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:35,439
YEAH, ROBERT,
I THINK IT'S A BIGGER ISSUE.

00:34:35,439 --> 00:34:36,774
BECAUSE OUR PHONES
ARE PORTABLE,

00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:39,610
OUR CHARGING DEVICES
HAVE ALSO BECOME VERY PORTABLE.

00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,479
WELL, WE -- WE'VE SEEN
A LOT OF OUR CUSTOMERS

00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:42,847
PUT IT IN THEIR OFFICE --
LIKE, AT THEIR DESK,

00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:45,416
AND WHAT WE FOUND IS
MOST PEOPLE ARE GONNA PAY

00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,718
30 BUCKS FOR A CHARGER
OR A CASE.
NO!

00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:48,886
AND THEY LOOK FORWARD
TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE --

00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:50,554
OH, 30 BUCKS?

00:34:50,554 --> 00:34:53,657
YOU GOT TO CONVINCE PEOPLE
THAT THEIR PHONE IS A CESSPOOL.

00:34:53,657 --> 00:34:54,692
AND YOU HAVE TO
CONVINCE THEM

00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:56,794
NOT TO USE PURELL
AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:58,529
I'M STRUGGLING 'CAUSE
YOU'VE SOLD HALF A MILLION,

00:34:58,529 --> 00:34:59,630
SO MAYBE I'M WRONG.

00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,766
MAYBE YOU'VE FOUND
A SEGMENT OF THE MARKET

00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,534
THAT'S REALLY ANAL ABOUT THIS.

00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:04,769
SO, WE'VE SPENT
A LOT OF MONEY

00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,537
TO DO FOCUSED
AND TARGETED MARKETING,

00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:07,805
SO WE'RE STARTING FIRST
WITH THE --

00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:09,573
HOW MUCH MONEY
HAVE YOU SPENT?

00:35:09,573 --> 00:35:10,741
THIS YEAR, WE'VE SPENT
ABOUT $80,000 IN MARKETING.

00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:11,842
WOW.

00:35:11,842 --> 00:35:13,444
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU RAISED
IN TOTAL?

00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,678
WE'VE RAISED $800,000,
SO --

00:35:14,678 --> 00:35:16,414
Cuban: OH!
$800,000?

00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:17,715
$800,000?
ON KICKSTARTER?

00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:18,849
Barnes:
IT WAS FROM A LOCAL INVESTOR.

00:35:18,849 --> 00:35:21,852
WE GAVE UP
60% OF OUR COMPANY.
60%?

00:35:21,852 --> 00:35:23,721
SO, THE QUESTION
IS WHY?
YES.

00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:24,755
WE WERE
TWO ENTREPRENEURS

00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:26,424
THAT REALLY HAD AN IDEA
THAT WE LOVED.

00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:27,591
WE HIT THE POINT
WHERE IT WAS LIKE,

00:35:27,591 --> 00:35:29,427
"IT'S GONNA COST US
A LOT OF MONEY TO MAKE IT,"

00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:31,796
AND WE DECIDED IT WAS EITHER BE
GREEDY AND HAVE THIS GO NOWHERE

00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,831
OR GIVE OURSELVES
AN OPPORTUNITY --
Cuban: OH, THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH.
THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH.

00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:36,634
THE PROBLEM IS
UNLESS YOU GET THAT P.R. POP,

00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,403
IT'S GONNA BE VERY,
VERY EXPENSIVE TO SUSTAIN.

00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:41,405
SO, YOUR SALES
PROBABLY GO LIKE THIS, RIGHT?

00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:43,507
IT'S A NICHE PRODUCT.

00:35:43,507 --> 00:35:44,742
YOU-YOU'RE NOT
A COMPANY YET.

00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:46,677
RIGHT.
ONE THING WE'VE UNCOVERED

00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:49,413
IS THAT THERE'S A HUGE MARKET
IN HOSPITAL AND SCHOOLS.

00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:52,416
BUT, GUYS,
THERE'S ALL KINDS OF SANITIZERS

00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:53,551
THAT HOSPITALS USE
FOR THEIR DEVICES.

00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:55,786
THERE'S A WHOLE PROTOCOL
THAT THEY GO THROUGH.

00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:57,888
SURE. WELL, HOSPITALS HAVE
STARTED REACHING OUT TO US

00:35:57,888 --> 00:35:59,623
TO COME
PRESENT THE PRODUCT,

00:35:59,623 --> 00:36:01,759
AND IT'S BECAUSE
THEY'RE STARTING TO DEPLOY

00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:03,594
LOTS OF TABLETS
INTO THE HOSPITALS.

00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:05,529
THEY USE THEM
WHEN THEY GO INTO THE ROOM.

00:36:05,529 --> 00:36:07,598
WES, I GOT TO TELL YOU, I...

00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:09,467
[ SIGHS ]
I DON'T SEE IT.

00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:11,469
I DON'T NEED A TANNING BED
FOR MY PHONE.

00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:12,470
I'M OUT.

00:36:14,638 --> 00:36:15,806
OKAY, LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE HOSPITAL APPLICATION.

00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:17,842
WHAT'S THE LOWEST COST
YOU CAN GET,

00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,743
AND CAN YOU GET IT SO IT CLEANS
IN UNDER A MINUTE?

00:36:19,743 --> 00:36:21,712
YEAH, THERE'S THREE PARAMETERS
THAT YOU NEED

00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:22,713
FOR EFFECTIVE U.V. KILLING.

00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:23,848
ONE OF THE THEM
IS THE PROXIMITY.

00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,649
THE FURTHER AWAY
YOU MOVE THE LIGHT

00:36:25,649 --> 00:36:27,485
FROM THE SURFACE,
IT DECREASES.

00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:29,553
ALSO THE INTENSITY
AND THE DURATION.

00:36:29,553 --> 00:36:31,422
AND SO YOU CAN PLAY WITH
THOSE THREE FACTORS,

00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:32,556
AND IF YOU CAN GET THE LIGHT
CLOSE ENOUGH

00:36:32,556 --> 00:36:34,658
AT THE RIGHT INTENSITY,
THEN YOU CAN REDUCE THE TIME.

00:36:34,658 --> 00:36:35,826
NOW YOU'VE GOT
MY INTEREST, RIGHT?

00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:38,829
A PRODUCT FOR CONSUMER
FOR PHONESOAP -- PBHT!

00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:41,499
BUT EVERY SINGLE PERSON
WHO GOES TO VISIT

00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:43,667
ANYBODY IN THE HOSPITAL
BRINGS THEIR PHONE.

00:36:43,667 --> 00:36:44,768
RIGHT.
RIGHT.

00:36:44,768 --> 00:36:46,637
THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT
SELLING PROCESS.

00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:47,805
IT IS A DIFFERENT
SELLING PROCESS.

00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:49,440
I'VE INVESTED IN COMPANIES
THAT SELL TO HOSPITALS.

00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,574
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW LONG --
YES, I DO. YES, I DO.

00:36:50,574 --> 00:36:51,609
'CAUSE I'VE GOT COMPANIES
THAT SELL TO HOSPITALS, AS WELL.

00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:53,644
THAT IS BRUTAL.
FORGET HOSPITALS.

00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:57,381
I CAN GO TO ANYBODY WHO PROVIDES
ANY TYPE OF HEALTH SERVICE

00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,884
AND SAY, SIGN UP THERE,
"PLEASE CLEAN YOUR PHONE.

00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:03,654
PUT IT IN HERE," SLAM IT,
ONE MINUTE, BOOM, AND I'M --

00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:05,623
WESLEY AND DAN, I THINK MARK
IS EXTREMELY OPTIMISTIC.

00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:07,858
I THINK
TEACHING ANY ADMINISTRATION

00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:10,561
TO START A NEW HABIT, ASK
THE VISITOR TO PUT THE PHONE IN,

00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,662
I THINK YOU'RE DREAMING.

00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:13,497
HERE'S MY OBJECTION TO IT.

00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:15,699
AS A SANITIZER,
IT'S EASY TO USE A BABY WIPE.

00:37:15,699 --> 00:37:16,667
THAT'S WHAT I DO.

00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:19,703
BABY WIPE -- DONE.
THROW IT AWAY.

00:37:19,703 --> 00:37:21,672
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,
IT'S NOT PORTABLE.

00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:23,774
I THINK EVERYBODY TRAVELS
WITH THEIR CHARGER TODAY.

00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:25,543
THIS IS TOO BULKY
TO TRAVEL WITH.

00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:26,544
RIGHT.

00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:28,379
AND SO, FOR ALL OF THOSE
REASONS, I'M OUT.

00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:32,816
O'Leary:
I DON'T THINK IT'S BEEN PROVEN
YET AS A SUCCESSFUL PRODUCT,

00:37:32,816 --> 00:37:34,785
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE MARKET

00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:37,621
IS REALLY ANAL ENOUGH
TO BUY THIS

00:37:37,621 --> 00:37:39,657
AND WHAT THE CUSTOMER-
ACQUISITION COST IS GONNA BE.

00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:42,426
THE ONLY WAY I DO THIS DEAL --
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU THIS OFFER --

00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,494
HERE'S HOW IT'S GONNA WORK.

00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:46,597
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU $300,000.

00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:49,867
I WANT $6 A UNIT
UNTIL I RECOUP THE $300,000.

00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:54,738
AFTER THAT, IT DROPS TO $3 UNTIL
I GET PAID OUT $1.2 MILLION,

00:37:54,738 --> 00:37:55,839
AND THEN I GO AWAY.

00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,709
IT'S -- IT'S A PURE
VENTURE-DEBT STRATEGY.

00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:01,512
I THINK IT'S FAIR.
IT'S SOMETHING.

00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:02,813
LET'S SEE IF
YOU YOU CAN DO ANY BETTER.
Cuban: IT'S SOMETHING.

00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:03,847
IT'S STILL A RIP-OFF.

00:38:03,847 --> 00:38:05,382
WE --
I -- I APPREC--

00:38:05,382 --> 00:38:06,584
WELL, APPARENTLY,
THAT'S COMING

00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:08,686
FROM SOMEONE
WHO GAVE YOU THIS. ZERO.
Corcoran: YEAH.

00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:10,854
I WOULDN'T INSULT YOU
WITH THAT.
LOTS OF ADVICE
THAT'S WORTHLESS.

00:38:10,854 --> 00:38:12,523
BY THE WAY, I THINK THE
HOSPITAL MARKET IS INTERESTING,

00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:16,493
BUT THE SALES CYCLE IS YEARS,
NOT MONTHS -- YEARS.

00:38:16,493 --> 00:38:17,828
WE APPRECIATE THAT OFFER.

00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:20,531
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR
IS SOMEONE TO COME IN

00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:21,899
FOR AN EQUITY STAKE
BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN SELLING IT.

00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:23,601
THE MARKET
HAS BEEN RESPONDING.

00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:26,637
60% OF OUR SALES ARE ONLINE
THROUGH TARGETED MARKETING,

00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:27,871
SO PEOPLE
ARE BUYING THIS.

00:38:27,871 --> 00:38:29,607
THEY DO LIKE
THIS CONCEPT.

00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:35,479
TO ME, THIS IS NOT SOMETHING
THAT EVERYBODY'S GOING TO BUY.

00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:39,383
BUT ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE,
THAT'S INTERESTING TO ME.

00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:41,852
ANY MEDICAL FACILITY,
PARTICULARLY IN A WAITING ROOM,

00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:44,555
WHERE YOU KNOW EVERYBODY'S
USING THEIR PHONES TO KILL TIME.

00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:46,790
BUT FROM A HEALTHCARE
PROFESSIONAL'S PERSPECTIVE,

00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:48,859
I COULD CARRY ANYTHING BAD
INTO THAT WAITING ROOM,

00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:50,828
WHICH COULD THEN BE PICKED UP
AND DISTRIBUTED

00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,863
THROUGHOUT THE HOSPITAL,
WAITING ROOM, WHATEVER.

00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:55,499
THAT'S ENORMOUS VALUE.

00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,568
BUT YOU CAN'T GIVE UP YOUR PHONE
FOR FIVE MINUTES.

00:38:57,568 --> 00:39:00,804
I MADE YOU AN OFFER.
SHOULD I WITHDRAW IT?

00:39:00,804 --> 00:39:04,742
UM, WE THINK THAT THE --
THE COMPANY IS, UM,

00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:06,510
IS WORTH
WHAT WE ASKED FOR.

00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,479
OKAY, HOW ABOUT THIS?
I'M OUT.

00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,748
WOW. BIRD IN THE HAND.

00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,785
OKAY, I'LL MAKE YOU GUYS
AN OFFER.

00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:16,687
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $300,000.

00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:17,855
YOU'RE A FOOL.

00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,624
I'M ALWAYS A FOOL,
BUT IT'S MADE ME A LOT OF MONEY.

00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:23,861
20%, AND THE CONTINGENCY IS
THAT YOU CAN DELIVER A UNIT

00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,729
THAT CHARGES IN 30 SECONDS

00:39:25,729 --> 00:39:29,466
AND THAT WE CAN PRICE
IN THE AREA OF THE $12 COST.

00:39:29,466 --> 00:39:31,869
ALL RIGHT, WES, DAN,
YOU'VE GOT AN OFFER -- $300,000.

00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,538
YOU HAVE HIS OFFER,
BUT YOU HAVEN'T HEARD MINE.

00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:38,442
WELL, REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED
LAST TIME.

00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:50,319
Narrator:
THREE SHARKS ARE OUT.

00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:51,620
MARK CUBAN
HAS OFFERED $300,000

00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:55,458
FOR 20% OF THEIR PHONE-CLEANSING
DEVICE PHONESOAP,

00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:58,227
BUT LORI WANTS IN
ON THE ACTION.

00:39:58,227 --> 00:40:00,262
Cuban: $300,000.
YOU HAVE HIS OFFER,
BUT YOU HAVEN'T HEARD MINE.

00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:03,232
Herjavec: WELL, REMEMBER
WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME.

00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,303
SO, I SAW THE "DR. OZ"
THAT WAS TALKING ABOUT

00:40:07,303 --> 00:40:08,571
WHAT'S ON THE PHONES, RIGHT?

00:40:08,571 --> 00:40:10,139
PRETTY SCARY.

00:40:10,139 --> 00:40:12,274
I'VE SOLD MILLIONS
IN CELLPHONE CASES,

00:40:12,274 --> 00:40:15,144
AND I'VE SOLD MILLIONS
IN SPONGE SANITIZERS

00:40:15,144 --> 00:40:16,312
THAT LOOK KIND OF LIKE YOURS,

00:40:16,312 --> 00:40:18,581
SO I GET THAT THIS IS
A GREAT CONCEPT.

00:40:18,581 --> 00:40:24,587
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE YOU
AN OFFER OF $300,000 AT 15%,

00:40:24,587 --> 00:40:27,423
BECAUSE I WANT TO TAKE
THIS UNIT, PUT IT ON QVC,

00:40:27,423 --> 00:40:29,225
PUT IT IN MY SHOW,

00:40:29,225 --> 00:40:32,561
AND SELL HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF DOLLARS IN IT LIKE THAT.

00:40:32,561 --> 00:40:36,198
IF YOU WANT TO GO CONSUMER,
QVC IS THE DESTINATION.

00:40:36,198 --> 00:40:37,500
MORE POWER TO YOU,
RIGHT?

00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,368
Herjavec:
THROWS YOU UNDER THE BUS.
NO, NOT JUST QVC.

00:40:39,368 --> 00:40:40,503
RETAIL -- ALL RETAIL.

00:40:40,503 --> 00:40:43,539
IF YOU WANT TO GO RETAIL,
WE ALL HAVE RETAIL CONNECTIONS,

00:40:43,539 --> 00:40:45,374
BUT, AGAIN, I SEE THIS MORE
AS A COMMERCIAL PRODUCT.

00:40:45,374 --> 00:40:47,543
WHY? BECAUSE WE CAN CONTROL
OUR OWN DESTINY.

00:40:47,543 --> 00:40:49,411
INSTEAD OF PUTTING IT
OUT THERE

00:40:49,411 --> 00:40:50,446
AND WAITING
FOR THE PHONE TO RING

00:40:50,446 --> 00:40:51,647
AND HOPING THAT PEOPLE WALK
INTO STORES --

00:40:51,647 --> 00:40:53,582
'CAUSE YOU CAN CHARGE
A PREMIUM FOR IT.

00:40:53,582 --> 00:40:54,683
IT SENDS THE MESSAGE

00:40:54,683 --> 00:40:57,219
TO EVERYBODY WHO WALKS
INTO THOSE DOCTORS' OFFICES

00:40:57,219 --> 00:40:58,487
THAT YOU NEED ONE,
RIGHT?

00:40:58,487 --> 00:41:00,322
IT'S VALUABLE,
AND IT WORKS.

00:41:00,322 --> 00:41:01,657
THE DOCTOR'S USING IT,
IT MUST BE SMART.
RIGHT.

00:41:01,657 --> 00:41:04,326
SO THAT'S WHY I SUG--
I SAY, DO IT ALL, GUYS.

00:41:04,326 --> 00:41:06,328
I MEAN,
WHY JUST DO DOCTORS' OFFICES?

00:41:06,328 --> 00:41:08,264
BUT IT'S TOUGH TO DO ALL, RIGHT?
IT'S TOUGH TO BE GREAT --

00:41:08,264 --> 00:41:09,431
OH, NO, IT'S NOT.
I DO IT ALL THE TIME.

00:41:09,431 --> 00:41:10,499
YEAH, BUT, LORI,
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME

00:41:10,499 --> 00:41:12,168
YOU CREATED A SALES FORCE
THAT WENT OUT

00:41:12,168 --> 00:41:14,270
AND SOLD A COMMERCIAL PRODUCT
INTO COMMERCIAL ORGANIZATIONS?

00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:15,504
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I DO.

00:41:17,373 --> 00:41:19,441
MARK, I HAVE OVER 500 PRODUCTS
IN 17 YEARS.

00:41:19,441 --> 00:41:20,643
RIGHT, AND YOU HAVE THAT
SALES FORCE THAT'S GOING ON,

00:41:20,643 --> 00:41:22,611
KNOCKING ON DOORS
ALL THE TIME, LORI.

00:41:22,611 --> 00:41:24,413
YOU KNOW WHAT? WE DO.
RIGHT.

00:41:24,413 --> 00:41:26,348
WES, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO?

00:41:27,416 --> 00:41:30,386
LORI CAME IN AT 15%,
AND YOU'RE AT 20%.

00:41:30,386 --> 00:41:32,221
IS THERE...

00:41:32,221 --> 00:41:34,323
Cuban: NO.
YOU'LL BE PART OF OUR ENTOURAGE.

00:41:34,323 --> 00:41:36,358
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN BUILDING A COMPANY

00:41:36,358 --> 00:41:37,560
AND JUST SELLING
A PRODUCT.

00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,429
I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE
$40 MILLION, ALMOST,

00:41:40,429 --> 00:41:41,597
IN ALL MY "SHARK TANK" PRODUCTS

00:41:41,597 --> 00:41:43,566
IF I DIDN'T HAVE
A GREAT SALES FORCE.

00:41:43,566 --> 00:41:45,568
AND THAT SALES FORCE
IS TELEVISION TIME ON QVC.

00:41:45,568 --> 00:41:48,270
IT'S NOT, MARK.
IT'S NOT FAIR TO SAY THAT.

00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:49,638
WE CAME IN AT 7.5%.

00:41:49,638 --> 00:41:51,607
15% IS HALF THE VALUATION.

00:41:51,607 --> 00:41:53,375
20% IS EVEN MORE
THAN THAT.

00:41:53,375 --> 00:41:54,543
IF WE COULD MEET
HALFWAY...

00:41:58,247 --> 00:42:00,316
Cuban: WHAT --
I'LL GO TO 10%
IF YOU TAKE MY OFFER RIGHT NOW.

00:42:00,316 --> 00:42:01,383
DEAL.
DEAL.

00:42:01,383 --> 00:42:02,418
DEAL.

00:42:02,418 --> 00:42:03,619
[ APPLAUSE ]
GREAT.

00:42:03,619 --> 00:42:04,620
[ CHUCKLES ] WHOO!
LORI.

00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,355
WE'RE GONNA CLEAN UP
THE MRSA. [ LAUGHS ]

00:42:06,355 --> 00:42:07,556
YES.
YES.

00:42:07,556 --> 00:42:09,491
I THINK THAT THE CONSUMER'S
GONNA LOVE IT.

00:42:09,491 --> 00:42:10,526
WE JUST HAVE TO
EDUCATE THEM.

00:42:10,526 --> 00:42:12,328
YEAH.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, GUYS.

00:42:12,328 --> 00:42:13,395
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
CONGRATULATIONS.
Corcoran: GOOD LUCK.

00:42:13,395 --> 00:42:14,597
THANK YOU.

00:42:14,597 --> 00:42:16,265
Greiner: WHEW!

00:42:16,265 --> 00:42:18,167
WHEW. BAH!

00:42:18,167 --> 00:42:19,635
WE JUST DON'T WANT TO SLOW DOWN
WHERE WE ARE NOW.

00:42:19,635 --> 00:42:21,170
AND I THINK MARK'S OFFER

00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:22,371
WAS TO KIND OF SLOW DOWN HERE
AND MOVE,

00:42:22,371 --> 00:42:24,273
WHEREAS LORI WAS LIKE,
"LET'S KEEP GOING HERE

00:42:24,273 --> 00:42:26,475
AND GIVE YOU THE MONEY
TO MOVE HERE."
