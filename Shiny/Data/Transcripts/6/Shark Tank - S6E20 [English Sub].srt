PISSING ME OFF RIGHT NOW.

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,700
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,068
I'M GONNA SAY
SOMETHING RUDE TO YOU.

00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:36,737
[ LAUGHS ] NO, DON'T BECAUSE
YOU'RE NOT A RUDE GUY.

00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:38,639
AND I DON'T WANT TO SAY
SOMETHING RUDE TO YOU,
SO I'M JUST GONNA GO.

00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:40,374
THERE WAS NO NEED
TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

HI, SHARKS. I'M ANNA STORK.

WE'RE SEEKING $200,000

00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,363
IN EXCHANGE FOR 10%
OF OUR BUSINESS.

00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:11,765
LuminAID BRINGS LIGHT
TO THE WORLD.

00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:14,134
OUR FIRST PRODUCT
IS AN INNOVATIVE SOLAR LIGHT

00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,069
THAT IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL
FLASHLIGHT OR LANTERN.

00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:19,339
IT STARTS OUT LIKE THIS --
A SLEEK, LITTLE PACKAGE,

00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,642
AND IT INFLATES
TO DIFFUSE THE LIGHT

00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:24,478
AND CREATE A LIGHTWEIGHT,
WATERPROOF LANTERN.

00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:28,882
LuminAID'S L.E.D. LIGHTS PROVIDE
UP TO 16 HOURS OF ILLUMINATION,

00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:30,984
AND IT HAS
TWO BRIGHTNESS SETTINGS.

00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:34,988
YOU DON'T NEED ANY AA's, C's,
OR D's -- JUST SUNLIGHT.

00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,590
USING THE BUILT-IN
SOLAR PANEL,

00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,525
YOU CHARGE IT IN THE SUN
DURING THE DAYTIME,

00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:39,926
AND THIS ENERGY IS STORED

00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:41,662
IN A THIN, EFFICIENT,
RECHARGEABLE BATTERY.

00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,331
LuminAID IS PERFECT
FOR OUTDOOR ADVENTURES.

00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,600
TAKE IT CAMPING, HIKING,
AND EVEN BOATING

00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,970
BECAUSE IT'S COMPLETELY
WATERPROOF, AND IT FLOATS.

00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,707
THIS PRODUCT IS USEFUL
IN A VARIETY OF SITUATIONS,

00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,308
AND WE'VE PROVEN
THAT THERE'S GLOBAL DEMAND.

00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,210
BUT WHAT WE'RE
REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT

00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,812
IS THE "AID"
IN "LuminAID."

00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:00,814
OUR LIGHT
SHINED BRIGHTEST

00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:02,416
FOR THOSE
WHO ARE LEFT DEVASTATED

00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,850
AFTER A NATURAL DISASTER.

00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,187
WE HAVE THE PERFECT TOOL
FOR FIRST RESPONDERS TO USE

00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,856
ON THE GROUND
IN AREAS WITHOUT ELECTRICITY

00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,425
OR THAT ARE RAVAGED
BY FLOODS.

00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:14,194
AND BEFORE DISASTER
EVEN STRIKES,

00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,564
LuminAID IS PERFECT IN THE HOME
AND CAR, JUST IN CASE.

00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:20,967
WE'RE COMMITTED TO MAKING
LuminAID A WORLDWIDE BRAND

00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,803
AND HOPEFULLY
MAKING PEOPLE'S LIVES

00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:24,538
A LITTLE BRIGHTER, TOO.

00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,240
WE ALWAYS SAY,
WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU LUMENS...

00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,076
Both: ...GET LuminAID.

00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:30,410
WHO WANTS TO JOIN US?
[ CHUCKLES ]

00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,545
THAT WAS GREAT.
Cuban: OH, LORD.

00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,280
EXPLAIN THE TECHNOLOGY.
IT'S REALLY SIMPLE.

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,049
IT'S A SOLAR PANEL,
A RECHARGEABLE BATTERY

00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,818
REALLY SIMILAR
TO THE RECHARGEABLE BATTERY

00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:38,852
THAT'S
IN YOUR CELLPHONE.

00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:40,320
THANK YOU.
JUST A BRIGHT L.E.D. LIGHT.

00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,290
SO, IT INFLATES TO DIFFUSE
THE LIGHT LIKE A LANTERN,

00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,158
HAVING
A LAMPSHADE EFFECT.

00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:46,159
DID YOU CREATE THIS?

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,994
YEAH. SO, WE'RE
ACTUALLY STUDENTS.

00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:50,864
WE WERE AT COLUMBIA
GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE

00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:53,366
RIGHT AFTER
THE HAITI EARTHQUAKE IN 2010,

00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,368
PEOPLE WERE COMPLETELY
WITHOUT ELECTRICITY,

00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,170
AND THERE WASN'T
A LIGHTING PRODUCT

00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,805
THAT WAS BEING DISTRIBUTED
IN VOLUME.

00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:01,808
SO WE SPENT THE SEMESTER
PROTOTYPING THE PRODUCT BY HAND.

00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,711
Shreshta: WE MADE THE FIRST
50 OF THESE IN OUR KITCHENS.

00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,447
AND AS IT HAPPENS,
A YEAR LATER,

00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:11,251
WE OURSELVES WERE IN JAPAN
DURING THE 2011 EARTHQUAKE.

00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,087
AND EVEN FOR US,
OUR PROTOTYPES --

00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,022
I MEAN, WE USED THEM
DURING THE POWER OUTAGES THEN.

00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,991
AND WE REALIZED, LIKE,
THIS IS A PRODUCT THAT HAS --

00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,093
YOU KNOW,
FILLS A UNIVERSAL NEED.

00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,161
HOW LONG DOES IT LAST?

00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:22,863
IT LASTS 16 HOURS
ON THE LOW SETTING

00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:24,431
AND 10 HOURS
ON THE HIGH SETTING,

00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,066
AND THEN YOU JUST RECHARGE IT
IN THE SUN IN SEVEN HOURS.

00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,367
[ BLOWS ]

00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:28,969
DO YOU HAVE
AN ENGINEERING BACKGROUND?

00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:30,570
I DO. SO,
I STUDIED ENGINEERING

00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,172
AT DARTMOUTH COLLEGE
IN MY UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE,

00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:34,040
AND THEN WE BOTH WENT ON
TO COLUMBIA GRADUATE SCHOOL.

00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,575
TELL --
TELL US ABOUT SALES, THEN.

00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:38,545
IN THE FIRST YEAR,
WE DID $250,000 IN SALES.

00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:40,080
WHOA!

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,115
IN THIS LAST 12 MONTHS,
WE DID JUST OVER $1 MILLION.

00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,450
Greiner: WOW.
Herjavec: IMPRESSIVE.
WHOA!

00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,818
[ CHUCKLES ]
SO, WE ACTUALLY HAVE --

00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,453
I MEAN, THERE ARE
THREE SORT OF CUSTOMER TYPES

00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:49,256
THAT WE SELL TO -- IT'D BE
INDIVIDUALS DIRECTLY ONLINE,

00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:53,026
AND THEN WE HAVE, YOU KNOW,
WHOLESALE/RETAIL/COMMERCIAL,

00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,995
AND THAT INCLUDES
OUR INTERNATIONAL DISTRIBUTION,

00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:57,531
AND THEN THE LAST WOULD BE
NGOs AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.

00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:59,766
TELL ME THE MARGIN.
HOW ARE YOU SELLING THE NGOs?
HOW ARE YOU SELLING THEM?

00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:00,967
WHAT PROCESS ARE YOU USING?

00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,637
SO, WE HAVE A COUPLE
LARGER NGO CUSTOMERS.

00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,173
OUR LARGEST IS
IN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,074
THAT PROCURE SUPPLIES
AND DISTRIBUTES THEM

00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:09,342
IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS.

00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,477
LIKE A RED CROSS OR...

00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,312
EXACTLY.
SO, IT'S ACTUALLY ShelterBox.

00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,715
YOU CAN SHIP 50 OF THESE
FOR THE SPACE OF 8 FLASHLIGHTS.

00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:19,352
SO, THEY HAVE PURCHASED 30,000
UNITS IN THE PAST 10 MONTHS.

00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:21,121
THEY'RE ONE OF
OUR LARGEST CUSTOMERS.

00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,789
AND TELL ME
WHAT YOU SELL IT TO THEM FOR.

00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,524
WE SELL TO THEM FOR $8.75.

00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:25,859
AND HOW DO YOU SELL --

00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,627
WHAT DO YOU SELL IT FOR
IN THE OTHER TWO AREAS?

00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,696
OUR DIRECT-CUSTOMER PRICE
IS $19.95.

00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:30,897
AND WHAT'S YOUR COST?

00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:33,600
COST TO MANUFACTURE IT
IS $4.75.

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,968
AND DO YOU HAVE
SOME KIND OF FUNDING BEHIND YOU?

00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:38,004
WE EACH PUT IN $7,500
OF OUR OWN MONEY

00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,372
BECAUSE WE THOUGHT
WE HAD A GOOD IDEA.

00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,474
SO, THEN
WE LAUNCHED THE PRODUCT

00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:43,176
THROUGH A SUCCESSFUL
CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGN.

00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,912
WE RAISED $50,000
ON A GOAL OF $10,000.

00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,381
WE'VE LEVERAGED
BUSINESS-PLAN COMPETITIONS

00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:51,651
AND GRANT COMPETITIONS, AND
WE WON AN ADDITIONAL $195,000.

[ LAUGHS ]

00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,355

BACK INTO THE BUSINESS.

BRAVO.

00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:58,325

TWO UTILITY PATENTS FILED.

ARE EXEMPT FROM THAT.

00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:20,233
BECAUSE OF
THE "SHARK TANK,"

00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:22,035
WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN ABLE
TO PROVIDE FOR OURSELVES

00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:23,703
AND A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE
IN THE AREA.

00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:25,505
EVEN THOUGH
I DON'T WEAR A UNIFORM ANYMORE,

00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:28,041
I STILL FEEL LIKE
I GET TO SERVE THIS COUNTRY,

00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,143
AND "SHARK TANK" HAS GIVEN US
THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT.

00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,711
All: BREACHER UP!

00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:44,123
Narrator:
NEXT UP IS A YOUNG COUPLE

00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,292
WITH A MISSION TO HELP
A GLOBAL COMMUNITY.

00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,536
HI, SHARKS. I'M JACK.
AND I'M ALLEY.

00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:58,538
AND WE'RE THE CO-FOUNDERS
OF TAALUMA TOTES.

00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:02,308
WE'RE HERE SEEKING $110,000
FOR 15% OF OUR COMPANY.

00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,743
IT'S TIME TO KICK

00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:05,878
THOSE BORING, GENERIC BACKPACKS
TO THE CURB.

00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,146
ALLEY AND I
WENT TO UGANDA

00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,581
DURING A SUMMER BREAK
FROM COLLEGE,

00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,149
AND WE COULDN'T
TAKE OUR EYES OFF

00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:12,185
ALL THE CRAZY FABRICS THERE.

00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,187
SO, WE PICKED OUT A FABRIC
AT THE LOCAL MARKET

00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:17,657
AND FOUND A SEAMSTRESS
TO SEW ALLEY A BEAUTIFUL SKIRT.

00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:19,192
AND JACK
GOT A LITTLE JEALOUS,

00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,760
'CAUSE HE COULDN'T
PULL OFF A SKIRT,

00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,128
SO HE CAME UP
WITH ANOTHER IDEA.

00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:23,730
HE HANDED THE SEAMSTRESS

00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,232
HIS BORING, GENERIC,
SOLID-BLACK BACKPACK

00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,034
AND ASKED HER TO MAKE
A MORE EXCITING ONE

00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,001
OUT OF THE LOCAL FABRIC.

00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:32,205
AND JUST LIKE THAT,
THE TAALUMA TOTE WAS BORN.

00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:36,142
SO, TAALUMA TOTES ARE BACKPACKS
PAIRED WITH COUNTRIES.

00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:39,545
EACH ONE IS MADE OF TRADITIONAL
FABRIC FROM THAT COUNTRY

00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,115
AND THEN FUNDS A MICROLOAN
FOR A PERSON IN THAT COUNTRY.

00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:44,450
SO, WHEN YOU CARRY TAALUMA,
YOU CARRY A COUNTRY.

00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,587
SO, WE STARTED THE BUSINESS
FROM OUR COLLEGE APARTMENT.

00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:49,589
AND WITH GRADUATION
AROUND THE CORNER

00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:52,158
AND TAALUMA'S MOMENTUM
REALLY BUILDING,

00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:54,494
WE TRADED OUR CALCULATORS IN
FOR TOTES

00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:56,195
AND MADE THIS
NIGHTS-AND-WEEKENDS PROJECT

00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,697
OUR FULL-TIME JOBS.

00:14:57,697 --> 00:15:00,366
SO, SHARKS,
THE QUESTION IS...

00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:01,901
Both:
...WHICH COUNTRY WILL YOU CARRY?

00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,202
[ CHUCKLES ]

00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,871
WE'D LIKE TO PASS OUT
SOME SAMPLES, AS WELL,

00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:06,005
IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
YEAH.

00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:07,974
JACK, WHERE'D
YOU GO TO SCHOOL?

00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:08,975
WE BOTH WENT
TO VIRGINIA TECH.

00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:10,176
WE STUDIED
ENGINEERING THERE.

00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:11,477
ALLEY,
WHAT COUNTRY IS THIS?

00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:12,845
THAT ONE'S
AN INDONESIA TOTE.

00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,380
Greiner:
WHAT COUNTRY IS THIS?

00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,748
MALI.
MALI?

00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,749
THAT'S RIGHT.
BEAUTIFUL.

00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,518
AND A BEAUT --
THIS IS MR. WONDERFUL.

00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:21,020
WE KNOW YOU LIKE GREEN, SO WE
PICKED YOU THE GREEN INDIA TOTE.

00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,188
THANK YOU.

00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:23,089
John: THANK YOU.

00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,157
DAYMOND,
THAT'S THE GHANA TOTE,

00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:25,358
AND, MARK,
THE IVORY COAST.

00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:27,360
SO, EACH OF THESE BACKPACKS
HAVE A STORY.

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,595
THIS ONE FUNDED A MICROLOAN
FOR AN ARTIST IN INDONESIA

00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,831
TO BUY MORE CRAFTS
AND SUPPLIES.

00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:33,599
AND EACH STOR--
EACH TOTE HAS A STORY LIKE THAT.

00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,134
JACK, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
THANK YOU.

00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:36,536
IT REALLY IS,
AND IT'S BEAUTIFULLY MADE.

00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:37,503
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:38,471
THE QUALITY IS INCREDIBLE.

00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:40,039
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?

00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,675
WE'VE SOLD $60,000 OF BACKPACKS
IN THE PAST 10 MONTHS,

00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:45,144
AND THAT'S FUNDED $6,000
IN MICROLOANS.

00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,980
HOW IN THE WORLD DID YOUR DAD
LET YOU GO TO UGANDA?

00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,582
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:51,851
MY DAD IS
IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT,

00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:54,287
SO I MOVED AROUND THE WORLD
MY WHOLE LIFE.

00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:57,023
YOU SAY THAT THESE
ARE DIFFERENT TERRITORIES.

00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:59,192
ARE YOU ACTUALLY MAKING THEM
IN THE TERRITORY,

00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:01,994
OR THE FABRIC IS JUST
INSPIRED BY IT?

00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,063
SO, WE GET TRADITIONAL FABRICS
FROM THE COUNTRIES.

00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,699
ALL OF THE FABRICS COME
TO WHERE THEY'RE MADE,

00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:09,335
OUTSIDE OF RICHMOND, VIRGINIA,
AND THEY'RE ASSEMBLED THERE.

00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,904
AND WHY DON'T YOU MAKE THEM
IN THOSE COUNTRIES?

00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:14,507
BECAUSE THAT ALSO
HELPS PROVIDE JOBS.

00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:15,808
WE ACTUALLY
DID CONSIDER THAT,

00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,510
BUT WE'RE REALLY EXCITED
ABOUT PROVIDING

00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,378
SOME LOCAL BENEFITS HERE
IN THE U.S., AS WELL.

00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:20,880
THE FACILITY THAT MAKES THEM

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,981
HIRES ADULTS
WITH DISABILITIES

00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,483
TO HELP
DO THE ASSEMBLY, SO...

00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,017
OKAY.
WOW.

00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,419
Greiner:
I THINK THAT'S GREAT.

00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:28,287
JACK, WHAT DO YOU
SELL IT FOR?

00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,489
$65.

00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,990
AND WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE IT, ALL-IN?

00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,291
$27.

00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,927
John: I WOULD PAY MORE
FOR THIS BAG.

00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:35,995
WHY ISN'T IT $100?

00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,763
WELL, SO,
OUR TARGET MARKET

00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,732
IS COLLEGE STUDENTS
AND YOUNG ADULTS.

00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,734
Greiner: I DON'T THINK YOU'RE
WRONG IN YOUR PRICE POINT.

00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,169
KIDS ARE
ON A BUDGET, RIGHT?

00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,904
YOU'RE MAKING IT
AFFORDABLE TO MANY,

00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:46,539
AS OPPOSED TO JUST A FEW.

00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:49,141
Herjavec: WHAT --
WHAT'S THE LARGER STRATEGY?

00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,309
HOW IS THE BUSINESS
GONNA GET BIGGER?

00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,310
WELL, SO,
THAT'S WHAT PART OF THE MONEY

00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,145
IS GONNA BE ALLOCATED FOR.

00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,948
WE WANT TO EXPAND
OUR CAMPUS AMBASSADOR PROGRAM.

00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,817
DO YOU HAVE THE AMBASSADOR
PROGRAM IN PLACE TODAY?

00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:59,785
WE'VE --
ON A VERY SMALL SCALE, YES.

00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:03,789
SO, WE'RE FINDING TWO STUDENTS
ON EACH CAMPUS

00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,191
TO REPRESENT TAALUMA TOTES

00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,693
AND SPREAD THE WORD
ON THEIR CAMPUS.

00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,962
DO THEY GET PAID
FOR THIS ACTIVITY?

00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:12,031
THIS ACTUALLY CAME
FROM AN INSANE NUMBER OF E-MAILS

00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,000
THAT WE GET FROM STUDENTS
JUST ASKING TO BE INVOLVED.

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,468
SO, THEY JUST WANT
TO HELP THE CAUSE?

00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:17,169
YEAH, THERE'S NO PAYROLL
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:18,137
O'Leary: DON'T WORRY --
WHEN YOU GET OLDER,

00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:19,872
YOU'LL TURN INTO
A CAPITALIST.

00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,173
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:22,141
HOW -- HOW ARE YOU DOING
THE MICROLOANS?

00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,143
I'D LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT.
YEAH, SO, IT IS A LOAN.

00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,546
IT'S A SMALL LOAN
THAT'S GIVEN TO AN ENTREPRENEUR

00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:29,081
IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD
TO GROW THEIR BUSINESS.
RIGHT.

00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,783
ONCE THEY CAN DO THAT
AND GENERATE THEIR OWN INCOME,

00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,418
THEY PAY IT BACK
WITHIN 12 MONTHS,

00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:35,354
AND WE USE THAT MONEY
TO BUY FABRIC FROM THAT COUNTRY

00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,356
FOR THE NEXT BACKPACK,
CLOSING THE LOOP.

00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:40,593
Herjavec:
JACK, ALLEY, VERY IMPRESSIVE.

00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:42,161
YOU KNOW, YOU TOOK AN IDEA,
YOU RAN WITH IT.

00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:46,065
I THINK THE PRODUCT
IS JUST BEAUTIFUL.

00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,166
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:50,836
YOU KNOW, WE'RE --
WE'RE HERE TO HELP BUSINESSES

00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,672
WHERE OUR CAPITAL
AND EXPERTISE

00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:54,540
CAN TAKE THEM
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,642
I MEAN, AT THIS POINT, REALLY,
THIS INVESTMENT

00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:59,245
IS GONNA KICK IT -- KICK-START
US UP TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:02,615
I MEAN, THE THINGS THAT ARE
HOLDING US BACK -- INVENTORY.

00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:05,318
WE'VE RUN OUT A FEW TIMES
IN THE PAST 10 MONTHS

00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:07,954
BECAUSE WE COULDN'T KEEP UP
WITH DEMAND.

00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:10,656
RIGHT, BUT THEY
ALREADY HAVE TO BE

00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:13,459
AT A CERTAIN LEVEL
TO SPRINGBOARD.

00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:16,696
I THINK THAT YOU'RE TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT THE STRATEGY,

00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:19,165
THE PRICE POINT, YOU KNOW,
THE AMBASSADOR PROGRAM.

00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:21,233
YOU'RE GONNA FIGURE IT OUT.

00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,703
I JUST THINK
IT'S A LITTLE EARLY.

00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:24,904
I'M OUT.

00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:28,174
WE'RE MOVING QUICK.

00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:29,475
WE'RE -- I MEAN,
WE'RE FAST LEARNERS AND --

00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,077
OH, YOU ARE, AND --
AND YOU'RE GOING TO,

00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:32,378
AND THAT'S HOW YOU LEARN,
RIGHT?
ABSOLUTELY, YEAH.

00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:33,779
YOU'RE -- YOU'RE GONNA TRY,
YOU'RE GONNA FAIL,

00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,047
YOU'RE GONNA FALL DOWN,
AND YOU'RE GONNA DO WHAT?

00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,616
PICK --
PICK RIGHT BACK UP.

00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,184
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT
WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR 10 MONTHS.

00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:40,086
GUYS, WHAT I SEE,
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD --

00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:43,823
GREAT PRODUCT, BUT YOU'RE
A PRODUCT, NOT A COMPANY.

00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:47,994
LIKE YOU SAID, YOU'VE FALLEN
DOWN, AND YOU'VE GOTTEN BACK UP.

00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:49,662
YOU HAVEN'T FALLEN DOWN
ENOUGH YET.

00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:51,998
AND FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.

00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:53,432
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
WE THANK YOU, ANYWAY.

00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:54,934
THANK YOU.

00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:57,003
YOU KNOW, WHEN
I FIRST STARTED MY BUSINESS,

00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:59,005
I HAD ONE PRODUCT IDEA,
SAME AS YOU,

00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:02,174
AND ONE OF
THE GREATEST THINGS FOR ME WAS

00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:04,210
THAT I HAD TO
FIGURE EVERYTHING OUT.

00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,211
I WAS ALONE.

00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:07,947
BUT AS I GREW A BUSINESS,

00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:09,615
I THEN KNEW
HOW TO RUN ALL FACETS OF IT,

00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,183
AND I COULD CONTINUE
TO MAKE MORE AND MORE PRODUCTS.

00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:14,787
I THINK YOU HAVE
ALL THESE STEPS AHEAD OF YOU.

00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:16,622
THE TWO OF YOU TOGETHER,
IF YOU LEARN THEM,

00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:18,024
YOU'RE GONNA BECOME
MUCH STRONGER.

00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:21,494
BUT FOR ME, IT'S TOO EARLY.

00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,429
I'M SORRY. I'M OUT.

00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:25,398
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
THANK YOU FOR YOUR FEEDBACK.

00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:27,600
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR FEEDBACK.
WE APPRECIATE IT.

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,135
John: I HAVE TO TAKE --
MY HAT'S OFF TO YOU

00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:31,037
BECAUSE TOO MANY KIDS THESE DAYS
ARE JUST TRYING TO MAKE MONEY

00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:32,738
AND DEVELOP AN APP BECAUSE
THAT'S THE NEW GOLD RUSH,

00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,140
AND YOU'RE ACTUALLY TRYING
TO MAKE CHANGE.

00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,541
[ CHUCKLES ] THANK YOU.

00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,010
HERE WAS MY CHALLENGE --

00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,813
YOU REALLY WEREN'T THINKING
ABOUT THE MARGIN,

00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:43,315
AND THAT MEANS
YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN

00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:44,784
AT THE CURRENT PRICE.

00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:47,086
AND I SAY THIS
TO ONE COMPANY EVERY SEASON --

00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:49,088
FIRST YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT,

00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:51,090
THEN YOU HAVE TO MASTER IT,

00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,858
AND <i>THEN</i> YOU CAN MATTER.

00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,195
I'M OUT.

00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,998
Herjavec: WELL, THERE'S
ONLY ONE COUNTRY LEFT.

00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,499
KEVIN?

00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:05,071
I HAD A LITTLE CONNECTION
WITH THIS WHEN ALLEY SAID

00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:07,406
THAT HER DAD WORKED AT THE STATE
DEPARTMENT AND TRAVELED A LOT.

00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:09,141
THAT WAS ALSO MY STORY.

00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:12,311
I LIVED IN CAMBODIA, TUNISIA,
ETHIOPIA, CYPRUS, JAPAN,

00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:13,846
SWITZERLAND, FRANCE.
WOW.

00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:15,948
EVERY TWO YEARS, WE MOVED.

00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:17,950
THE PROBLEM WITH THIS,
YOU KNOW,

00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,251
AND I ALWAYS
GET DRAGGED BACK TO REALITY,

00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:20,653
BUT THAT'S WHAT I LOVE
ABOUT MYSELF.

00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:22,188
THAT'S WHY THEY CALL ME
"MR. WONDERFUL."

00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:26,358
YOU GUYS ARE NOT WORTH
$700,000 -- NOWHERE NEAR IT.

00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,994
IT'S WAY, WAY, WAY TOO EARLY.

00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:33,165
BUT I DON'T THINK YOUR COMPANY'S
EVEN WORTH $110,000 YET.

00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:35,167
SO, AS FAR AS
THE VALUATION GOES,

00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,303
WE'RE VALUING THE COMPANY
ON SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT.

00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:39,038
AND WHAT WE'VE LEARNED
FROM THIS --

00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:40,039
THESE FIRST FEW MONTHS

00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:42,575
WAS HOW TO BUILD A COMMUNITY
AROUND OUR MISSION,

00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,143
RATHER THAN JUST SELL A PRODUCT
TO A CUSTOMER.

00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:45,878
AND THAT IS SO MUCH MORE
VALUABLE

00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:48,247
AND SO MUCH MORE GENUINE,
AS YOU --
NO, YOU'RE -- YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,116
IT'S --
IT'S BEAUTIFUL TO STRETCH,

00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:52,017
BUT WHAT HAPPENS IS
WHEN YOU END UP

00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:54,353
IN FRONT OF A FINANCIAL INVESTOR
LIKE ME,

00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:55,821
WHO'S GOT TREMENDOUS DISCIPLINE,

00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:57,189
'CAUSE HE'S BEEN AROUND
A LONG TIME,

00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,625
I LOOK FOR THE POTENTIAL
OF FREE CASH FLOW

00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,093
IN THE NEXT 36 MONTHS.

00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,828
THAT'S WHEN YOU CAN DETERMINE

00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:04,897
WHETHER THIS IS A HOBBY
OR A BUSINESS.

00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:08,634
LOOK, YOU'RE
WAY TOO EMBRYONIC FOR ME.

00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:09,802
I'M OUT.

00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:11,036
ALL RIGHT,
THANK YOU, ANYWAYS.

00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,538
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR FEEDBACK.

00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:14,406
MAYBE WE CHOSE THE WRONG
STRATEGY IN OUR FIRST YEAR.

00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:15,508
WE SHOULD HAVE
CHASED THE --

00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:17,076
Cuban: NO, NO, NO.
YOU JUST -- YOU --

00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:18,644
YOU GO THROUGH THE PROCESS,
AND YOU LEARN.
OKAY.

00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:19,912
IT JUST DOESN'T ALL HAPPEN
IN ONE YEAR.

00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:20,913
YOU'RE RIGHT.
RIGHT.

00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:21,947
IT TAKES TIME.

00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,883
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU FOR THE FEEDBACK.

00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:25,084
THANK YOU.
WE APPRECIATE IT.

00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:26,952
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.

00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,521
GOOD LUCK.
GOOD LUCK.
Alley: THANKS.

00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:31,023
John:
I LOVE ENTREPRENEURS LIKE THIS.

00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:32,658
I LOVE THEM.
THEY WANT TO MAKE A CHANGE,

00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:35,194
BUT YOU CAN'T MAKE A CHANGE
IF YOU DON'T STAY IN BUSINESS.

00:21:35,194 --> 00:21:37,763
I PROBABLY WOULD PAY $200
FOR THIS IF I --

00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:39,198
ESPECIALLY WITH THE STORY,
IF YOU KNEW THE STORY.

00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:40,933
WITH THE STORY,
I WOULD PAY $200 FOR THIS,

00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:42,134
AND I WOULD BE PROUD.

00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,546
MY NAME IS RYAN FANT.
AND I'M NAYEEM HUSSAIN.

00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:54,880
WE'RE FROM NEW YORK CITY.

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,949
AND WE'RE THE CO-FOUNDERS
OF KEEN HOME.

00:21:56,949 --> 00:21:58,184
TAXI!

00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:01,520
RYAN AND I MET STUDYING AT

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,490
THE NYU STERN SCHOOL
OF BUSINESS DOING OUR MBAs.

00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,958
WE BECAME
VERY GOOD FRIENDS.

00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,160
LOOK AT THIS.
KEEP GOING.

00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,495
[ BOTH LAUGH ]

00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:10,830
OH!

00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,332
NYU HAS AN AMAZING
ENTREPRENEURSHIP PROGRAM.

00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,534
WE ENTERED
A BUSINESS COMPETITION CALLED

00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:17,303
THE ENTREPRENEURS CHALLENGE.

00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:19,672
THEY AWARDED US
AN $18,000 GRANT.

00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,507
AND THIS YEAR,
WE EARNED A SPOT

00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:24,176
IN <i>INC.</i> MAGAZINE'S
"COOLEST COLLEGE STARTUPS."

00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,177
SO, HEAR, HEAR!

00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,179
IT REALLY GAVE US
THE CONFIDENCE

00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,615
THAT THE BUSINESS THAT WE WERE
CREATING REALLY HAD LEGS.

00:22:29,615 --> 00:22:31,684
WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT
SOME BOXES.

00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:34,119
I LIKE
THE SLEEVE CONCEPT HERE.

00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,088
WE'VE SINCE GRADUATED
FROM NYU.

00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:38,824
NOW RYAN AND I ARE FULL TIME
AT KEEN HOME,

00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:41,160
AND WE'RE LOOKING TO BRING
OUR FIRST PRODUCT TO MARKET.

00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,161
THERE WE GO.

00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:43,295
WE NEED AN INVESTMENT
FROM THE SHARKS

00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:45,698
TO HELP US SCALE
TO MEET DEMAND

00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,733
AND GROW THE COMPANY
EVEN FASTER.

00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,235
I THINK PART OF BEING
AN ENTREPRENEUR

00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:51,003
IS REALLY JUST BELIEVING

00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:53,038
THAT YOU'RE GONNA SUCCEED
NO MATTER WHAT.

00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,307
AND WE REALLY BELIEVE
THAT KEEN HOME IS SOMETHING

00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:57,042
THAT'S GONNA TAKE US
VERY FAR IN LIFE.

00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:17,663
HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS RYAN FANT.

00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:19,031
AND I'M NAYEEM HUSSAIN.

00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:21,033
AND WE'RE THE CO-FOUNDERS
OF KEEN HOME,

00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:22,968
HEADQUARTERED
IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK.

00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:28,073
WE'RE SEEKING $750,000 IN
EXCHANGE FOR 10% OF OUR COMPANY.

00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:33,212
Hussain: THE KEEN VENT IS
A WIRELESSLY CONNECTED AIR VENT

00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:35,748
THAT AUTOMATICALLY OPENS
AND CLOSES

00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:38,784
TO INTELLIGENTLY REDIRECT
AIRFLOW THROUGHOUT A HOME.

00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:41,987
THE KEEN VENT
IS EASILY USER-INSTALLED.

00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:45,624
A CUSTOMER SIMPLY REMOVES
THE EXISTING VENT

00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:46,792
FROM THE DUCT OPENING

00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:49,828
AND INSERTS OUR PRODUCT
IN ITS PLACE.

00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:52,197
ONCE INSTALLED,

00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:54,900
THE VENT AUTOMATICALLY CONNECTS
TO THE INTERNET.

00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,237
THE AVERAGE U.S. HOUSEHOLD
SPENDS HALF IT'S ENERGY BILL

00:23:58,237 --> 00:23:59,705
ON HEATING AND COOLING.

00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:02,308
NOW, YOU WOULDN'T USE
A SINGLE LIGHT SWITCH

00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:04,076
TO CONTROL ALL THE LIGHTS
IN YOUR HOME,

00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:06,412
SO WHY ARE WE STILL RELIANT
ON A CENTRAL THERMOSTAT

00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:09,882
FOR THE HEATING-AND-COOLING
NEEDS OF INDIVIDUAL ROOMS?

00:24:09,882 --> 00:24:12,418
WITH THE KEEN VENT,
YOU CAN USE YOUR SMARTPHONE

00:24:12,418 --> 00:24:14,286
TO TAKE CONTROL
OF YOUR AIRFLOW.

00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:17,623
SO, SHARKS, ARE YOU READY
TO HELP US MAKE EVERY HOME...

00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:19,024
Both: ...A KEEN HOME?

00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,860
SO, IT'S A THERMOSTAT,
IN ESSENCE?

00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,462
NOT REALLY --
IT'S AN AIRFLOW --

00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,997
SO, IS IT
JUST A AIRFLOW --

00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:27,166
THINK ABOUT IT AS A COMPLEMENT
TO AN EXISTING THERMOSTAT.

00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,168
SO, IF YOU HAVE
A SMART THERMOSTAT, LIKE A NEST,

00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:30,903
IT'LL MAKE
YOUR NEST SMARTER.

00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:32,805
HOW MUCH MONEY DO I SAVE
IN A MONTH?

00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,039
IF MY TYPICAL BILL
IS 600 BUCKS...

00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,207
SURE. YEP.

00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:37,643
...HOW MUCH MONEY
DO I SAVE?

00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,678
THE AVERAGE HOMEOWNER
SPENDS $2,000 PER YEAR

00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:40,913
ON HEATING AND COOLING.

00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:43,949
IF WE CAN REDUCE THE COST
BY EVEN JUST 10%,

00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:46,318
WHICH WOULD BE WAY LESS
THAN WHAT OUR TESTS HAVE SHOWN.

00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,953
YOU HAVE A TWO-YEAR R.O.I.
IT'S A TWO-YEAR R.O.I.

00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:50,689
HOW MANY UNITS DID THEY PUT
IN EACH ONE OF THOSE HOUSES?

00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:52,191
FOUR TO UP TO SIX.
FOUR.

00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:54,093
WE HAD A --
OUR PRODUCT
COSTS $80 PER VENT.

00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:56,695
OKAY, SO, NOT -- NOT --
OKAY, SO --
SO, A SYSTEM OF FOUR
IS $320.

00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:58,731
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU ALL INVESTED,

00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:00,833
AND HOW MUCH HAVE YOU
GONE OUTSIDE TO GET?
THIS IS ABOUT -- THIS IS
ABOUT TO GET TO INVESTORS

00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,401
AND ALL KIND OF STUFF
RIGHT NOW.
YEAH, SO,
WE INVESTED $50,000 --

00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:03,902
WE INVESTED $50,000
OF OUR PERSONAL MONEY,

00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:06,138
AND THEN WE RAISED, RIGHT
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR,

00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:09,508
$120,000 AS A PART OF THE
TECHSTARS ACCELERATOR PROGRAM.

00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,010
UH-HUH.

00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,679
AND THEN, IN MAY, WE CLOSED
A SEED ROUND OF $1.5 MILLION.

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,481
THERE YOU GO.
THAT'S WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.

00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:16,749
[ LAUGHS ]

00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:17,716
SILLY GOOSE.

00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:19,184
OH, THE PUNCH LINE,
RIGHT?

00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,919
YOU DIDN'T THINK
WE WERE GONNA GET TO THAT, HUH?

00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:22,321
WHAT WAS THE PRE-MONEY --

00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:23,188
WHAT WAS THE PRE-MONEY VALUE
ON THE $1.5 MILLION?

00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,790
$3.75 MILLION.
MM-HMM.

00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,692
SO, THAT ROUND PUTS YOU AT A
POST-MONEY OF ABOUT $5 MILLION?

00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,627
ABOUT --
ROUGHLY $5 MILLION, YEAH.
$5 MILLION, YEAH.

00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:29,962
WHAT IS THE ADDED VALUE

00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:32,564
THAT MAKES ME PAY
AN ADDITIONAL $2.5 MILLION,

00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:36,969
'CAUSE YOU'RE ASKING ME
TO GIVE YOU $7.5 MILLION.
NO, MORE THAN THAT.

00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:38,303
WHAT'S HAPPENED SINCE MAY

00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:39,405
THAT WOULD MAKE ME PAY
THAT MUCH MORE?

00:25:39,405 --> 00:25:40,806
WE DE-RISKED THE BUSINESS

00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:42,641
FROM BEING AN IDEA TO NOW IT'S
THE PRODUCT. WE HAVE --

00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,543
NO, YOU HAVEN'T
SOLD ANY YET.

00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,512
WE'VE PRESOLD 35,000 UNITS
TO LOWE'S.
Greiner: PRESOLD 35,000 UNITS
TO LOWE'S.

00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:48,614
OH.
35,000 GOING TO LOWE'S.

00:25:48,614 --> 00:25:50,082
OH, YEAH. YEAH.
PUNCH LINE NUMBER TWO.

00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:52,117
NOW YOU'RE TALKING DIRTY.

00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:54,620
DID THEY ASK FOR EXCLUSIVITY
FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME?

00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,088
YEAH, SO THERE'S --
HOW LONG?

00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:57,456
SO, THERE'S
A TWO-YEAR EXCLUSIVE IN --
WHOA! NO --

00:25:57,456 --> 00:25:58,357
IN THE HOME-IMPROVEMENT
CHANNEL --

00:25:58,357 --> 00:25:59,258
ONLY IN THE HOME-IMPROVEMENT
CHANNEL.

00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:00,826
IN THE HOME IMPROVEMENT --
MM-HMM.

00:26:00,826 --> 00:26:02,327
NOW, CAN YOU STILL SELL,
THOUGH, ONLINE?

00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:03,162
YEP, MM-HMM.
OH, YES. OH, YES.

00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:05,998
AND CAN YOU SELL
TO INDEPENDENTS?

00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:07,099
YES.
YES.

00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:08,567
AND CAN YOU SELL IT
TO OTHER CORPORATIONS, B2B?
YEAH.

00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,635
100%, YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.

00:26:09,635 --> 00:26:10,669
GUYS, WHEN I LOOK AT THIS,

00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:12,171
I SAY THIS IS A FEATURE,
NOT A PRODUCT.

00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:13,539
OKAY.
RIGHT?

00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:14,873
YOU'RE A FEATURE
OF THE AUTOMATED HOME.

00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:16,008
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT --

00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:18,544
WHEN SOMEONE WALKS INTO
THAT LOWE'S STORE,

00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:21,814
THEY ARE LOOKING
TO AUTOMATE THEIR HOMES,

00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:24,149
NOT AUTOMATE THEIR VENTS.
MM-HMM.

00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:25,184
RIGHT?
THAT'S THE CHALLENGE.

00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:26,518
I DON'T THINK THAT YOU HAVE

00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:27,920
AN AUTOMATED CURE FOR THAT.

00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,656
YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY.
YOU'RE A LONG WAYS FROM IT.

00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:32,458

HERE'S MY PROBLEM --

00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:38,597
I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED ABOUT
WHAT EXACTLY THIS IS GOING TO DO

00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,199

OF ABOUT $3 MILLION.

I KNOW -- I'M A STUDENT.

THE COST OF COLLEGE

00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,037
AND THERE YOU HAVE IT --
A LIST OF SCHOLARSHIPS

00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:28,173
YOU QUALIFY FOR,
LITERALLY IN MINUTES.

00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:29,841
SO, WE HAVE, LIKE,
THE LORI SCHOLARSHIP,

00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,977
BANK OF THE TANK,
SHARK BAIT SCHOLARSHIP,

00:33:31,977 --> 00:33:33,912
MR. WONDERFUL'S
STINGY SCHOLARSHIP.

00:33:33,912 --> 00:33:35,647
SEE? $1,000.

00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:37,048
[ LAUGHTER ]
Cuban:
I LIKE HIM ALREADY.

00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:38,116
WE LOVE YOU ALREADY.

00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:39,985
BOY, YOU'RE REALLY
SUCKING UP TO ME.

00:33:39,985 --> 00:33:41,119
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU'RE STINGY, MAN.

00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,087
I CAN'T -- WHAT CAN I SAY?

00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:44,789
SCHOLLY ISN'T JUST A BUSINESS,
IT'S MY PASSION.

00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:46,591
I WANT TO HELP STUDENTS
LIKE MYSELF

00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:48,793
FIND MONEY TO GO TO
THE COLLEGE OF THEIR DREAMS.

00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:50,762
SO, INVESTING IN SCHOLLY
MEANS THAT YOU, TOO,

00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:52,030
CAN MAKE SOME DREAMS
COME TRUE.

00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,031
SO LET'S DO THIS.

00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,333
CHRISTOPHER, GREAT IDEA.

00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,968
YOU ARE 100% CORRECT.

00:33:56,968 --> 00:34:00,138
THERE ARE <i>SO MANY</i> SCHOLARSHIPS,
IT'S A JUNGLE.

00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:01,873
YES.

00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,375
I DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE
FIGURE IT ALL OUT.

00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:04,876
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS --

00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,012
IS THAT THE ACTUAL APP
THAT YOU SHOWED ME?

00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:08,246
THAT'S THE ACTUAL APP.

00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:10,415
THE APP IS FOR iPhone
AND ANDROID, YES.

00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:12,250
HOW ARE YOU CURATING
ALL THE SCHOLARSHIPS?

00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,185
I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN BUILDING
DATABASES AND HELPING STUDENTS

00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:15,820
WITH SCHOLARSHIPS
FOR A COUPLE YEARS NOW.

00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,822
AND I AGGREGATED
THAT LIST OF SCHOLARSHIPS

00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:20,025
FROM DIFFERENT WEBSITES,
THEN I MANUALLY INPUT THEM,

00:34:20,025 --> 00:34:21,593
AND, BASICALLY,
ONCE THEY'RE IN OUR DATABASE,

00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:23,328
WE DON'T -- WE DON'T HAVE TO
MANAGE THE PROCESS ANYMORE.

00:34:23,328 --> 00:34:25,430
DO YOU DO THIS BY YOURSELF,
OR DO YOU HAVE PARTNERS?

00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:26,464
I HAVE TWO CO-FOUNDERS.

00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:27,999
THEY BOTH ARE APP
AND WEB DEVELOPERS.

00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:30,335
I AM THE --
I'M THE BUSINESS GUY, THE C.E.O.

00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:32,037
HOW'D YOU COME UP
WITH THIS IDEA?

00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:33,505
SO, I'M JUST RIGHT
NOW A JUNIOR.

00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:35,140
I'M AN UNDERGRADUATE
AT DREXEL UNIVERSITY.

00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,576
I WON $1.3 MILLION
IN SCHOLARSHIPS.

00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:39,544
$1.3 MILLION?
Cuban: WHAT?!

00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:40,812
YES.
O'Leary: REALLY?

00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:42,213
I'M FASCINATED BY THAT.
HOW DID YOU ACHIEVE THAT?

00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:43,481
YEAH, I MEAN,
THAT'S LIKE A LOTTERY WIN.

00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:44,649
SO -- YES, SO --
HOW DID YOU GET THERE?

00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:46,952
YEAH, SO, I --
IT TOOK ME A WHILE.

00:34:46,952 --> 00:34:48,353
IT TOOK ME ABOUT SEVEN MONTHS
BEGINNING IN MY JUNIOR YEAR

00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:50,188
TO REALLY FIND ALL
THESE DIFFERENT SCHOLARSHIPS.

00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:51,456
I SCOURED THE WEB.

00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:53,091
I GOT MULTIPLE
FULL-RIDE SCHOLARSHIPS.

00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,426
I GOT COCA--
THE COCA-COLA SCHOLARSHIP.

00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:55,327
WHAT WAS
THE BIGGEST ONE?

00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:56,761
THE BILL GATES SCHOLARSHIP.

00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,196
HOW MUCH?
WOW.

00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:00,198
IT'S A FULL RIDE TO ANY COLLEGE
YOU WANT TO GO TO.

00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:02,167
TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR DRIVE
TO GET THE SCHOLARSHIPS.

00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:05,036
I HAD A SINGLE MOM --
LOW INCOME, TWO SIBLINGS.

00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:07,005
AND I HAD TO WORK
REALLY HARD.

00:35:07,005 --> 00:35:09,407
I HAD A GREAT GPA,
I HAD GREAT TEST SCORES,

00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:11,409
AND I ACTUALLY COULD NOT APPLY
TO SOME OF THE SCHOOLS

00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:13,578
I WANTED TO GO TO
BECAUSE OF THE APPLICATION FEES.

00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:15,413
I THINK WE CAN ALL RELATE
TO THAT STORY.

00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:16,715
RIGHT.

00:35:16,715 --> 00:35:17,916
I'M THE FIRST PERSON
IN MY ENTIRE FAMILY

00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:18,650
EVER TO GO TO COLLEGE.

00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,919
I GET THE VALUE.

00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:22,253
WHAT YOU JUST DID
WAS AMAZING.

00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:26,191
SO, DO YOU THINK, LIKE,
YOU COULD GET ME $1.3 MILLION...
YES.

00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:28,093
...FOR EDUCATING THESE --
THESE BOBOS UP HERE
FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS?

00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:29,861
YEAH, SO --
SO, ACTUALLY, WITH SCHOLLY,

00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:31,096
EVERY STUDENT THAT USES OUR APP

00:35:31,096 --> 00:35:33,031
IS MATCHED BETWEEN 120
TO 220 SCHOLARSHIPS,

00:35:33,031 --> 00:35:34,099
TOTALING OVER $4 MILLION.

00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:36,201
SO IT'S GIVING THEM ACCESS
TO WIN ALL THAT MONEY.

00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:38,036
SO, IN OTHER WORDS, YOU --
YOU FOUND THE ONES THAT ARE --

00:35:38,036 --> 00:35:40,038
ARE -- ARE
INSTITUTIONAL-NEUTRAL.
OUT--

00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:41,206
THEY DON'T CARE
WHERE YOU GO.

00:35:41,206 --> 00:35:42,974
YES, SCHOLLY FOCUSES
ON OUTSIDE SCHOLARSHIPS.

00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,343
WE'RE NOT -- WE'RE NOT BOOKED
ON INSTITUTIONAL SCHOLARSHIPS.

00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:46,645
SO, TO DAYMOND...
Herjavec: AH.

00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,046
...SO, DAYMOND,
YOUR QUESTION IS --

00:35:48,046 --> 00:35:49,848
THERE ARE ABOUT $100 MILLION
THAT GOES UNCLAIMED

00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:51,082
IN OUTSIDE SCHOLARSHIPS,

00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:52,951
MAINLY 'CAUSE STUDENTS
DON'T KNOW THEY EXIST.

00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:55,654
OKAY, CHRISTOPHER,
HOW DO I MAKE MONEY WITH THIS?

00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:57,322
SCHO-- SO, SCHOLLY IS 99 CENTS
IN THE APP STORE.

00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:58,523
WE ALREADY SOLD 92,000 APPS.

00:35:58,523 --> 00:35:59,924
HOW MANY?

00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:01,493
92,000 PAID APPS,
LESS THAN A YEAR,

00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:04,462
AND ALL
WITH ZERO MARKETING.

00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:05,864
SO, IT'S REALLY COOL.

00:36:05,864 --> 00:36:07,899
WE HAD A VERY EFFECTIVE
P.R. STRATEGY GOING FOR IT.

00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:11,169
SO, I USED THE FACT THAT I WON
$1.3 MILLION IN SCHOLARSHIPS

00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,138
AND PITCHED REPORTERS
TO THE FACT

00:36:13,138 --> 00:36:14,372
THAT I CREATED THIS APP
FOR OTHER PEOPLE.
IT'S BRILLIANT.

00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:15,807
Greiner: DO YOU WANT
TO KNOW SOMETHING, CHRISTOPHER?

00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:18,076
GO AHEAD.
I'M GONNA DO SOMETHING
I'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE.

00:36:18,076 --> 00:36:19,244
I HAVEN'T HEARD
A WHOLE LOT,

00:36:19,244 --> 00:36:20,478
BUT I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER RIGHT NOW.

00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:24,816
AWESOME.

00:36:24,816 --> 00:36:26,017
Cuban: LET ME JUST ASK
SOME REAL QUESTIONS, OKAY?

00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:30,155
MY OFFER RIGHT NOW IS
THE 40K FOR 15%.

00:36:30,155 --> 00:36:31,690
I BELIEVE IN YOU.

00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,158
I BELIEVE IN WHAT
YOU'RE DOING -- IS GOOD.

00:36:33,158 --> 00:36:35,493
I THINK THAT WE WILL
MAKE IT TOGETHER.

00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:36,928
SO I HOPE
YOU JUST SAY YES.

00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:39,431
I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR
OTHER OFFERS, LORI.

00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:41,499
AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.

00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:43,201
THAT -- THAT REALLY MEANS
A LOT TO ME.

00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,370
SCHOLLY IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.

00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,138
I'M OFFERING YOU
EXACTLY WHAT YOU ASKED FOR.

00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:48,973
YES, I WOULD LOVE TO HE--

00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:50,642
I DON'T --
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA ASK YOU,

00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:51,643
"HOW DO WE MONETIZE THIS?"

00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:53,812
BUT I WANT YOU
TO SAY YES.

00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,949
John:
I WANT TO BE PART OF THIS.

00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:00,418
IT'S REALLY
A PERSONAL MATTER.

00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:02,120
I STARTED WORKING
AT 10 YEARS OLD.

00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,355
AND I WAS RAISED
BY A SINGLE MOTHER.

00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:07,258
ME, TOO.
WHEN I GOT TO
ABOUT THE AGE OF 17 YEARS OLD,

00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:09,694
I WANTED TO GO TO COLLEGE,
BUT I HAD TO WORK

00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:11,763
BECAUSE I SAW
HER WORKING THREE JOBS,

00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:13,698
AND THERE WAS
NO FOOD ON THE TABLE.

00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:17,235
I RESONATE WITH THIS, SO
I'LL OFFER YOU THE SAME THING --

00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,637
THE $40,000 FOR 15%.

00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:22,574
CHRISTOPHER, LOOK AT ME.

00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,075
I BELIEVE IN
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:29,013
I-I-I--
I DON'T CARE ABOUT HOW
WE'RE GOING TO MONETIZE IT.

00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:31,449
I JUST WANT YOU
TO TAKE MY HAND

00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:33,651
AND SAY "DEAL,"
AND WE WILL MAKE IT WORK.

00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:35,120
BUT I'D LIKE YOU TO DO IT
RIGHT NOW.

00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,990
WOW, THAT'S
PRETTY AGGRESSIVE.

00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,292
John:
IF SHE HAD THE BEST INTERESTS,

00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:42,861
I THINK SHE WOULD LET YOU
LISTEN TO EVERYBODY.
I MEAN IT.

00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:44,129
NEVER HAPPENED,
CHRISTOPHER.

00:37:44,129 --> 00:37:46,197
I -- WHATEVER WAY,
I WANT TO BE PART OF THIS.
LOOK AT ME.

00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:48,166
I-I JUST WANT TO HEAR
WHAT EVERYONE HAS TO SAY.

00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:49,801
Herjavec: CHRISTOPHER.
LIKE, I-I LOVE YOUR OFFER.
I LOVE THE MONEY.

00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:50,802
DON'T GET IMPATIENT WITH ME,
AND, ALSO --

00:37:50,802 --> 00:37:51,736
SO, CHRISTOPHER.
YEAH?

00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:53,371
SO, THE KEY TO YOUR SITE

00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:56,141
IS YOUR ABILITY
TO UPDATE THE SCHOLARSHIPS.

00:37:56,141 --> 00:37:59,043
IS THERE A BACK-END ENGINE
THAT'S TAKING IT ALL IN?

00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:00,578
HOW ARE YOU DOING THAT?

00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:01,846
HOW MANY DIFFERENT SCHOLARSHIPS
DID YOU SAY

00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:02,814
WERE IN YOUR DATABASE?

00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:05,049
BETWEEN 10,000 AND 20,000.
OH!

00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:06,851
MY CO-FOUNDER
DEVELOPED AN ALGORITHM

00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:08,019
WHERE HE GATHERED ALL THE
SCHOLARSHIPS FROM DIFFERENT --

00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,487
FROM DIFFERENT --
FROM DIFFERENT WEBSITES.

00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:10,855
NOW, SEE, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
TRYING TO GET TO.
YEAH.

00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:12,457
LOOK, YOU HAVE
TWO CO-FOUNDERS.

00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:13,992
RIGHT.
THEY'RE DEVELOPERS.

00:38:13,992 --> 00:38:15,994
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT
THEIR SKILL SET IS BECAUSE --

00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:18,296
ME -- ME TOO, BECAUSE
THAT'S WHAT I NEED TO UNDERSTAND

00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,165
IS HOW YOU'RE GONNA
CONSTANTLY DO IT.

00:38:20,165 --> 00:38:22,367
YOU WALKED IN HERE
WITH A THOUGHT.
THIS COULD BE
A VERY LARGE BUSINESS.

00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:24,369
AND DAYMOND AND I BOTH
ARE NOT EVEN ASKING YOU.

00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:25,904
[ SIGHS ]

00:38:25,904 --> 00:38:27,071
WELL, LET HIM ANSWER IT.
LET HIM ANSWER.

00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:29,140
I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT HE SAYS TO THAT.
John: YEAH.

00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,542
Greiner:
WE'RE SAYING -- YOU KNOW WHAT?
YEAH, BUT THAT'S
EXACTLY THE WRONG THING.

00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:32,310
HANG ON. HANG ON.
THAT'S -- THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT HE DOESN'T WANT.

00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,145
Herjavec:
LORI, YOU'RE MINIMIZING HIM.
JUST HANG ON.
I'M NOT MINIMIZING HIM.

00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,147
DO YOU WANT
A CHARITY DONATION...
HE ARE READY -- NO.

00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,949
...OR DO YOU WANT TO BUILD
A BUSINESS? WHICH IS IT?
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:40,018
I MEAN, I -- MY GOAL HERE --
I WANT SOMEONE THAT REALLY

00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:41,419
BELIEVES IN WHAT WE'RE DOING.
THIS DOESN'T MEAN -- YEAH.
I TOLD YOU I DID.

00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:42,921
John: I BELIEVE IN IT.
ROBERT AND MARK PROBABLY HAVE --

00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:44,155
HOW COULD YOU BELIEVE IN IT
WHEN YOU HAVEN'T EVEN ASKED

00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,356
ABOUT THE ENTIRE BUSINESS
AND HOW IT WORKS?

00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:46,491
HERE -- BECAUSE THIS --
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,259
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
BECAUSE -- THAT'S RIGHT.

00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:49,794
WE'LL TAKE AFFORDABLE
NEXT STEPS FORWARD.
YOU KNOW, CHRISTOPHER,
YOU KNOW --

00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:51,029
WE WILL CALL THE OTHER ROBERTS
AND CUBANS OF THE WORLD

00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:52,430
TO GIVE US ADVICE ON THIS.
WELL, YOU --

00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,598
YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU
KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT? YEAH.

00:38:53,598 --> 00:38:55,099
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M WILLING
TO DO IT WITH DAYMOND.

00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:56,334
YEAH, OKAY.
DAYMOND, IF YOU'RE WILLING
TO DO IT WITH ME...

00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,702
I ABSOLUTELY WILL DO IT
WITH YOU.

00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:59,571
I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD JUST SAY
RIGHT NOW, "DO IT."

00:38:59,571 --> 00:39:03,241
OKAY, LORI AND I ARE GONNA GO
IN 50-50 PARTNERS.

00:39:03,241 --> 00:39:05,009
THAT'S $20,000 FROM HER,

00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:08,413
$20,000 FROM ME
FOR 15% OF YOUR COMPANY.

00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:13,952
YOU HAVE TO MAKE
A DECISION NOW.

00:39:18,423 --> 00:39:19,858
I'M GONNA TAKE --
I'M GONNA TAKE YOUR DEAL.

00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:21,426
DONE.
GOOD. DONE.

00:39:21,426 --> 00:39:23,027
THANKS.
ALL RIGHT.

00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,329
THANKS. THANKS.
THANK, MAN.

00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:25,129
THAT'S AWESOME.

00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:26,464
THANK YOU.
I LOVE YOU GUYS.

00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,465
I'M REALLY GLAD.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:28,900
LET'S GET A GROUP HUG.
GROUP HUG.

00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,001
GROUP -- GROUP HUG!

00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:30,835
THANKS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:31,669
GOOD.
YOU'RE AMAZING.

00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:33,171
THANKS.
THANKS SO MUCH.

00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,141
I AM FEELING REALLY GREAT.

00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:38,243
I STEPPED IN THE SHARK TANK

00:39:38,243 --> 00:39:39,878
THINKING, LIKE,
"PROFIT, PROFIT, PROFIT,"

00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:42,146
BUT I'M REALLY HAPPY TO FIND
TWO SHARKS WHO DON'T --

00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:43,915
WHO CARE MORE
ABOUT WHAT SCHOLLY'S GONNA DO

00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:45,817
FOR THE PUBLIC THAN --
THAN THE BOTTOM LINE,

00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:46,584
SO I'M REALLY HAPPY.

00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:47,485
I'M SUPER EXCITED.

00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:49,354
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I HAD NOTHING

00:39:49,354 --> 00:39:51,756
AND, UH, COULDN'T RUB
TWO PENNIES TOGETHER,

00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:53,358
YOU KNOW
WHAT I REALLY HATED?

00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:55,760
I HATED WHEN PEOPLE WANTED
TO GIVE ME A BREAK

00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,029
BECAUSE
THEY FELT BAD FOR ME.

00:39:58,029 --> 00:40:00,098
UH, WE'RE NOT DOING IT
BECAUSE WE FEEL BAD FOR HIM.
John: I DIDN'T FEEL BAD.
I DON'T FEEL BAD AT ALL.

00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:01,199
Cuban: I NEVER GOT
ONE OF THOSE. [ LAUGHS ]

00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:03,201
ARE YOU KIDDING?
I DON'T FEEL BAD AT ALL.

00:40:03,201 --> 00:40:05,336
I'M NOT UNDERMINING
WHAT YOU DID.
YEAH, BUT WHY DO YOU THINK
THIS WAS A PITY MOVE?

00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:06,537
THE GUY WAS A GREAT GUY.
IT WASN'T A PITY MOVE.

00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:07,805
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW
THE BACK-END ENGINE WORKED.

00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:09,407
YOU DIDN'T
EVEN KNOW THAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,075
NO, BUT -- BUT HERE'S WHAT --
HERE'S WHAT I DO KNOW --
HE WAS 99 CENTS AN APP.

00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,211
BUT I ASKED, "IS IT A CHARITY,
OR IS IT A BUSINESS?"

00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:15,480
HE WAS 99 CENTS AN APP.
HE DOWNLOADED 92,000.
Greiner: SOMETIMES,
IT IS NOT ALL ABOUT MONEY.

00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,783
I'M -- I'M A VERY
CHARITABLE GUY, TOO.
SOMETIMES,
IT'S ABOUT HELPING AMERICA

00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:20,652
AND MAKING THE WORLD
A BETTER PLACE.
IS IT A CHARITY?

00:40:20,652 --> 00:40:22,086
LORI, THAT IS SUCH CRAP.

00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,122
NO, IT IS NOT CRAP.
I TELLING YOU --
I'M NOT SITTING HERE --

00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:26,124
WE ARE NOT
THE CHARITY TANK.
NO, WE ARE NOT
THE CHARITY TANK.

00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:28,159
WE'RE NOT HERE
TO GIVE IT OUT.
THAT'S NOT CHARITY,
ROBERT.

00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,160
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S NOT CHARITY, AND --

00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,528
REALLY?
HOW DOES THAT WORK?

00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:32,196
HOW ARE YOU GONNA GROW
THAT BUSINESS?

00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:33,765
WHAT'S THE EXECUTION PLAN?
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO?

00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:35,099
WE'RE GONNA BUILD THE
BUSINESS -- TRUST ME ON THIS.

00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,668
WE'RE GONNA GROW --
PEOPLE GETTING EDUCATIONS.

00:40:36,668 --> 00:40:38,069
WHAT? "WE'RE GONNA
FIGURE IT OUT?"
YES, WE'RE GONNA
FIGURE IT OUT.

00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:39,470
THAT'S RIGHT.
AMERICA, COME TO THE TANK!

00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,205
WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU MONEY
BECAUSE WE LIKE YOU.
OH, MY GOD.

00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:42,740
OH, YOU DIDN'T INVEST IN ANYBODY
ELSE WHO'S GONNA FIGURE IT OUT.

00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,176
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
YOU BET ON THE PERSON.

00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:46,978
I NEVER GOT ANY INFORMATION.

00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:48,713
WITH THE --
WITH THE INFORMATION --
I GOT INFORMATION.

00:40:48,713 --> 00:40:50,815
HE WASN'T ALLOWED TO TALK
BECAUSE YOU HAD TO FORCE $40,000

00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:53,184
DOWN HIS THROAT
LIKE A GOOSE FOR PâTé.

00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:54,452
[ Laughing ] OH, MY GOD.
YEAH.

00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,120
NO PROBLEM, GUYS.
THAT'S WHAT HE CAME IN ASKING!

00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,588
I THOUGHT, AT THAT POINT, THAT
I RECEIVED ENOUGH INFORMATION

00:40:57,588 --> 00:40:59,357
TO FEEL LIKE I WANT TO BE PART
OF THE RIDE.
YOU KNOW WHAT, DAYMOND?

00:40:59,357 --> 00:41:00,525
IF HE WOULD HAVE JUST SAID,

00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:01,960
"THIS IS AN IDEA,"
I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT.

00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,328
LOOK, I-I'M NOT TRYING
TO GIVE YOU A HARD TIME.
I AGREE.

00:41:03,328 --> 00:41:04,862
I'M NOT TRYING TO GIVE YOU A
HARD TIME. YOU KNOW I REALLY --

00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:06,130
YOU GUYS JUST DON'T LIKE
WHEN YOU GET SCOOPED.

00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,432
[ Laughing ] OH!
OH!

00:41:07,432 --> 00:41:08,700
THE BOTTOM LINE IS
THAT THIS GUY -- THIS GUY --

00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,701
IT -- THAT WAS SO --

00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:11,536
WAIT. EXCUSE ME.
I'M TALKING.

00:41:11,536 --> 00:41:14,038
I ACTUALLY BELIEVE
THAT DAYMOND AND I,

00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:15,640
NO MATTER WHAT IT IS
THAT THIS GUY NEEDS --

00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,008
WE'LL BE THERE TO BACK HIM.

00:41:17,008 --> 00:41:18,977
YEAH, BECAUSE YOU JUST
BENT OVER BACKWARDS FOR $40,000.

00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,244
IT IS NOT
THE CHARITY TANK.

00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:21,679
COME ON. COME ON, LORI.
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:23,715
IF YOU'RE TRULY TRYING
TO HELP THE GUY THEN --
I AM.

00:41:23,715 --> 00:41:24,983
WAIT. IF YOU'RE TRULY TRYING
TO HELP THE GUY,

00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:26,517
WHAT I WANT TO DO
IS ASK HIM QUESTIONS.

00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:28,152
THIS IS ALL SOUR GRAPES.
HE STARTED TALKING ABOUT
AN ALGORITHM.

00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,121
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT ALGORITHMS?

00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:32,323
IT'S ALL SOUR GRAPES.
IT'S NOT SOUR GRAPES!

00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,258
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE
REALLY PISSING ME OFF RIGHT NOW.

00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:36,127
I'M GONNA SAY
SOMETHING RUDE TO YOU.

00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:37,261
[ LAUGHS ] NO, DON'T,
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT A RUDE GUY.

00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:38,463
AND I DON'T WANT TO SAY
SOMETHING RUDE TO YOU,

00:41:38,463 --> 00:41:40,031
SO I'M JUST GONNA GO,
OKAY?

00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:41,833
BECAUSE I -- THERE WAS NO NEED
TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,134
YES, YOU SHOULD DO THAT,
BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT YOU.

00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:44,635
YOU GOT --
YOU'RE SMARTER THAN THAT.

00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:47,905
YOU'RE NOT THE GUY
TO WALK AWAY AND WALK OFF.

00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:49,874
YES, WE'RE THE SHARK TANK,
WE'RE NOT THE CHARITY TANK.

00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:51,876
BUT SOMETIMES, THERE'S
A POINT TO BEING COMPASSIONATE

00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:54,045
AND CARING ABOUT THINGS
THAT MATTER.
I DON'T THINK
IT'S NOT AN INFLUENCE.

00:41:54,045 --> 00:41:55,046
THEN GIVE HIM $100,000.

00:41:55,046 --> 00:41:56,547
RUN OUT THERE
AND CHANGE IT TO $100,000.

00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:58,783
THINGS THAT MATTER.
THINGS THAT MATTER.
BE COMPASSIONATE.

00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,518
EDUCATION AND SCHOLARSHIP
IS IMPORTANT.
BE COMPASSIONATE.

00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,120
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.
THE GUY --

00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,188
HE ALREADY DIED 'CAUSE YOU'VE
CHOKED HIM ON THE $40,000.
OH, MY GOD.

00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,323
YOU WANT
TO HELP ALL THESE KIDS

00:42:05,323 --> 00:42:06,958
AND SEND A MESSAGE,
BE COMPASSIONATE.

00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:08,493
YOU KNOW WHAT? I FEEL
REALLY GOOD ABOUT WHAT I DID.

00:42:08,493 --> 00:42:09,927
LET'S GO.
DAYMOND, DO YOU?

00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:11,829
I FEEL GREAT.
WE FEEL GREAT.

00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:18,002
I THINK THEY DON'T LIKE
THAT WE JUMPED IN.

00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:19,670
I'M SORRY
THAT THEY WERE UPSET.

00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,172
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S SOUR GRAPES.

00:42:21,172 --> 00:42:22,206
WHAT WE DID WAS GREAT.

00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,408
THANK YOU.
I LOVE IT.
