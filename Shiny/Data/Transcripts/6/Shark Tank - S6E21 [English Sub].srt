WHY WE DO THIS SHOW.

HOW COOL IS THAT?

THAT'S COOL.
YEE-HAW!

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,119

00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:33,100
I WILL GIVE YOU EXACTLY
WHAT YOU CAME IN ASKING FOR.

00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,134
DO WE HAVE A DEAL?

00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:35,335
WAIT.
WAIT.

00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:37,237
OKAY.
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:39,373
NO, NO, NO, NO.
SHUT UP, SCOOBY-DOO.

00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:42,175
YOU KNOW WHAT, BARB,
YOU WANT TO GO IN WITH ME?

00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:45,178
I'M GONNA GO IT ALONE,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:47,114
I'LL DO IT AT 15%.

00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:48,982
<i>I'LL</i> DO IT AT 15%.

00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:50,284

00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:53,353
Narrator:
WHO ARE THE SHARKS?

00:00:55,222 --> 00:01:00,227
THEY'RE SELF-MADE
BUSINESS EXPERTS WORTH BILLIONS.

00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:03,130
KEVIN O'LEARY IS
A SHREWD VENTURE CAPITALIST

00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,998
WHO MADE HIS FORTUNE

00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:06,433
SELLING A CHILDREN'S
EDUCATIONAL COMPANY

00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:09,169
FOR OVER $4 BILLION.

00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:13,106
BARBARA CORCORAN WENT FROM
WAITING TABLES IN MANHATTAN

00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:17,311

00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:21,281

AN IMMIGRANT FACTORY WORKER,

00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:54,281
FIRST INTO THE TANK
IS A UNIQUE TOOL

00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:57,084
TO MAKE THE MOST
OF A TRENDY FRUIT.

00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:05,459
GREETINGS, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS DAVE GOODMAN.

00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:09,463
I'M FROM NEW YORK CITY, AND
MY COMPANY IS CALLED COCO JACK.

00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:13,066
I'M HERE ASKING FOR $125,000 IN
EXCHANGE FOR 10% OF MY COMPANY.

00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,068
SHARKS,
THESE ARE YOUNG THAI COCONUTS.

00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:18,071
THEY'RE ENJOYED BY HUNDREDS
OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WORLDWIDE.

00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,339
THERE'S JUST ONE LITTLE PROBLEM.

00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,074
IT'S HOW YOU USUALLY
GET INTO THEM.

00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,315
OH, MY GOD.
DO YOU EVER MISS?

00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,283
WE GET E-MAILS ALL THE TIME
FROM PEOPLE WHO DO.

00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:32,152
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,121
THERE'S GOT TO BE
AN EASIER WAY.

00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:35,389
AND NOW THERE IS.

00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,057
INTRODUCING THE COCO JACK.

00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:39,092
COCO JACK OPENS
YOUNG THAI COCONUTS SAFELY

00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,428
IN JUST A FEW SECONDS, NO MATTER
YOUR SIZE OR STRENGTH.

00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:44,064
WE'VE HAD ABOUT 1,000 PEOPLE
DOING THIS,

00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:47,034
FROM 4-YEAR-OLD KIDS TO LITTLE
OLD LADIES, EVERYONE IN BETWEEN.

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,342
JUST LIKE THAT, AND THERE --
YOU'RE IN.

00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:58,045
JUST TAKES A FEW SECONDS.
Herjavec: CAN I TRY IT, DAVE?

00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:00,247
OF COURSE, YEAH.
DO YOU HAVE TO
FLIP THE HAMMER?

00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:02,416
YES, THAT'S IN THE INSTRUCTIONS.
[ LAUGHS ]

00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,418
THERE YOU GO. WHO ELSE
WANTS TO COME UP AND TRY IT?

00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:06,086
WHOA, ROBERT.
SURE.

00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:07,254
Herjavec:
GIVE ME A COCONUT, DAVE.

00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:08,422
Goodman:
RIGHT. HERE YOU GO.

00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:12,125
SO, THE COCO JACK GOES
ON TOP OF THE COCONUT LIKE THIS.

00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,227
YOU WANT TO HIT IT
A FEW TIMES.

00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,365
DAMN, KEVIN!
COME ON, KEVIN!

00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,067
ALL RIGHT, DOWN, BOY,
DOWN, BOY, DOWN, BOY.

00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:23,003
LITTLE OVERKILL. THAT'S
WHAT WE CALL COCO THERAPY.

00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:24,104
ALL RIGHT, LET ME TRY.

00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:27,374
AND YOU'RE IN, YEAH.
THAT'S PLENTY.

00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:30,177
GIVE IT ONE MORE FOR GOOD LUCK
IN THE FRONT.

00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:32,145
HAVE YOU TRIED
THESE COCONUTS BEFORE?
NO.

00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:33,380
YOU HAVEN'T?
NO. CAN I TRY?

00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,981
HERE'S A STRAW.
OF COURSE.

00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,083
OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,018
ENJOY.
Greiner:
SO, I HAVE A QUESTION.

00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:39,252
WHERE DO YOU GET
THE COCONUTS LIKE THAT?

00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,188
THEY COME LIKE THIS FROM
THAILAND. IT'S A GREAT QUESTION.

00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:42,989
THAI COCONUTS ARE
THE SWEETEST COCONUTS ON EARTH.

00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,391
YOU CAN GET THEM
AT ANY ASIAN MARKET,

00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,993
MOST MEXICAN/LATINO MARKETS,
INTERNATIONAL MARKETS,

00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:49,329
AND ALMOST ANY WHOLE FOODS
OR HEALTH FOOD STORE.

00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,298
THE BEST PART OF THE COCONUT
IS ACTUALLY THE MEAT.

00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:53,266
AND WE HAVE A STAINLESS-STEEL
SCOOP TOOL, AS WELL,

00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,968
THAT'LL GET ALL THE MEAT OUT.

00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,269
IS THAT <i>YOUR</i> TOOL?
YES, SIR.

00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:59,139
THIS IS A BIG, BIG SELLING POINT
FOR THE TOOL, AS WELL.

00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:03,110
ALL THE MEAT'S GONNA COME OUT
JUST LIKE THAT IN ONE PIECE.

00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,311
Greiner: OH, WOW.

00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:07,114
THAT, TO ME, IS MORE IMPRESSIVE
THAN THE FIRST PRODUCT.

00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:09,216
WHAT DO YOU GET
IN THE COCO JACK PACKAGE?

00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:11,351
THIS IS IN THE COCO PACK, AND
THAT COMES IN THE BURLAP SACK

00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,086
THAT SHOULD BE OVER THERE
IN FRONT OF YOU.

00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,488
DAVE, I'VE HEARD THAT
DRINKING EXCESSIVE COCONUT WATER

00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:17,424
ACTUALLY CAUSES
A LAXATIVE EFFECT.

00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,159
ANY TRUTH TO THAT?
[ CHUCKLES ]

00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:20,460
I'M NOT A DOCTOR.

00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,231
BUT, YEAH, I THINK
THERE CAN BE A CLEANSING EFFECT.

00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:26,166
O'Leary:
GIVE ANOTHER ONE TO BARBARA.

00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,434
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,169
HERE YOU GO.

00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:30,437
Herjavec: AND IT'S VERY, VERY
HEALTHY FOR YOU, RIGHT, DAVE?

00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,038
IT'S EXTREMELY HEALTHY.

00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:34,207
IT'S VERY HYDRATING.
IT'S FULL OF ELECTROLYTES.

00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:37,310
IT'S VERY GOOD. SWEET.
TASTES LIKE CORN.

00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,379
Corcoran: HOW DOES A GUY
LIKE YOU COME UP WITH AN IDEA

00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,081
OF BEING
IN THE COCONUT BUSINESS,

00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,150
AND WHERE DID YOU GET THAT
OUTFIT IN A TOWN LIKE NEW YORK?

00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,251
YOU DON'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME.

00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:45,318
I KNOW. I'M A COMPLICATED GUY.

00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,020
AND I'M ACTUALLY
FROM NEW YORK CITY.

00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,255
I SOLD MY APARTMENT IN NEW YORK

00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,056
2 1/2 YEARS AGO
TO LIVE FULL-TIME ON THE ROAD.

00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:53,260
I BOUGHT FOUR R.V.s.
AND I'M PREP-SCHOOL RAISED.

00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,129
AT 14 YEARS OLD, I HAD
A CLASSICAL MUSIC CONVERSION.

00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,999
WENT TO JUILLIARD
AS A PERCUSSIONIST, A COMPOSER.

00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,467
WOW.
I WAS A CONDUCTOR.
I WENT OUT TO CALIFORNIA.

00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,269
I STARTED STUDYING ECONOMICS.

00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:04,404
I STARTED STUDYING
MYTHOLOGY, POLITICS.

00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,206
BECAME A PRIVATE PILOT
IN COLORADO.

00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:07,374
THIS HAS SOMETHING TO DO
WITH COCONUTS?

00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,075
I'M GETTING THERE.

00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:12,345
A FRIEND OF MINE TURNED ME ON
TO A RAW VEGAN DIET,

00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,447
AND COCONUTS WERE A BIG PART
OF THE REGIME.

00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:17,417
AND I OPENED THEM ALL THE TIME
WITH MY CLEAVER, AND I SAID,

00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,152
"THERE'S GOT TO BE
A BETTER WAY TO DO THIS."

00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,054
THIS IS
A VERY INTERESTING STORY,

00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:23,223
BUT I MISSED THE PART
WHERE I MAKE THE MONEY.

00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:27,093
Greiner: OKAY, SO WHO IS SELLING
THE COCO JACK RIGHT NOW?

00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,029
ME. PRIMARILY THROUGH
OUR WEBSITE.

00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:30,330
Herjavec:
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?

00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,399
ABOUT 325,000
IN 9 MONTHS.

00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,967
HOW MUCH
DO YOU SELL THEM FOR?

00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:35,135
AVERAGE ABOUT $60.

00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:36,970
WHAT'S YOUR COST
TO MAKE IT?

00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,071
RIGHT NOW,
THEY'RE MADE IN THE U.S.A.

00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,206
FOR THESE TOOLS, ABOUT $26.

00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:41,975
WHEN THIS WAS
A GLIMMER IN YOUR EYE,

00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:43,376
FROM THE FIRST MOMENT,
HOW MANY YEARS

00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:46,313
DID IT TAKE YOU TO GO FROM
GLIMMER TO AN ACTUAL PRODUCT?

00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:48,248
I HAD THE IDEA
ABOUT 12 YEARS AGO.

00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:51,318
12 YEARS TO GET YOUR PRODUCT
OFF THE GROUND?

00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:53,053
WELL, I WASN'T TRYING
FOR 12 YEARS.

00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:56,356
YOU WEREN'T PASSIONATE ENOUGH
TO, LIKE, DIVE IN?

00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,391
I WAS OCCUPIED
WITH OTHER THINGS.

00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,393
I WAS PASSIONATE
ABOUT OTHER THINGS AT THE TIME.

00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:04,097
ONCE I GOT INTO IT, I THOUGHT,
"OKAY, I'M MAKING THIS

00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,266
FOR 20,000, 50,000,
MAYBE A MILLION RAW FOODISTS

00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:08,101
IN VENICE BEACH
AND ORANGE COUNTY."

00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,103
WHEN I STARTED DOING
CUSTOMER DEVELOPMENT,

00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,038
PEOPLE SAID, "NO, DAVE,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,207
"EVERY THAI RESTAURANT,
EVERY VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT,

00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,343
ALL THE PAN-ASIAN RESTAURANTS,
THEY ALL SELL COCONUTS."

00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:18,445
I'M CURIOUS
HOW ORGANIZED YOU ARE.

00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,982
HMM. GREAT QUESTION.

00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:26,019
I PREFER CREATIVE THINKING.

00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:28,221
I ALSO BELIEVE IN OUTSOURCING
STUFF I'M NOT GOOD AT.

00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,223
I HAVE THREE PEOPLE
WHO ARE BEAN COUNTERS,

00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,225
NO. OKAY. SO --
AND THEY'RE VERY AGGRESSIVE
ABOUT THAT.

00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,360
AND I'M NOT GONNA
SPEND MY ENERGY --

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,062
OKAY. TIME OUT.
WANT TO GET A WORD IN HERE.

00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,397
EVERY TIME I INVESTED

00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,432
IN AN ENTREPRENEUR
WHO WASN'T ORGANIZED

00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:43,103
OR HAD A RIGHT-HAND PERSON THAT
TOTALLY ORGANIZED THE BUSINESS,

00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:44,237
GUESS WHAT?

00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,039
THEY NEVER DELIVER.
MY --

00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:49,175
<i>AND</i> THEY SPENT MY MONEY
SO QUICKLY AND NOT SO WISELY.

00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,111
OKAY.
THAT'S A FAIR CRITICISM.

00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:53,313
SO, FOR SIMPLY THE REASON
OF LACK OF ORGANIZATION,

00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:55,115
WHICH I BELIEVE
I'M RIGHT ON,

00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:56,316
I HAVE TO BE OUT.

00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:01,021
WELL, I HAVE
SOME GOOD NEWS FOR YOU.

00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,222
OKAY.

00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:03,390
AND I HAVE SOME BAD NEWS
FOR YOU.

00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:08,395
THE GOOD NEWS IS
I LOVE IT.

00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:11,364
I THINK THAT YOU HAVE
A MARKET FOR THIS.

00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,333
IT'S GOT MERIT,
IT'S USEFUL,

00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:17,203
AND YOU WILL SELL THEM
TO SOME PEOPLE.
OH, YEAH.

00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,172
BUT TO THE BAD NEWS,
I'M OUT...

00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:23,310
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE

00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,980
A BIG-ENOUGH MARKET
FOR ME TO INVEST IN IT.

00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,448
DAVE, I REALLY LIKE
THE IDEA.

00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,083
THANK YOU, ROBERT.

00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:34,220
I MEAN, I LOVE STUFF THAT IS
OBTUSE, THAT IS VERY UNIQUE,

00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,157
THAT IS A LITTLE BIT OUT THERE,
KIND OF LIKE YOU.

00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:38,391
YOU THINK?

00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:42,295
BUT I DON'T SEE
THE NEXT STEP.

00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,297
I JUST DON'T SEE IT.

00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,332
I'M OUT.

00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:50,003
O'Leary: OKAY, DAVE.
I'VE GOT A LITTLE STORY FOR YOU.

00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:53,173
THIS VARIETY OF COCONUT
IS PROMINENT IN CAMBODIA,

00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:55,041
WHERE I GREW UP
WHEN I WAS YOUNG.

00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,243
MY HOUSEKEEPERS BACK THEN

00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,079
USED TO TAKE ME TO THE MARKET
EVERY MORNING,

00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:03,216
AND I WOULD WATCH IN FASCINATION
WITH THE MASTERY THEY HAD

00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,452
TO CARVE IT INTO THIS SHAPE
AND THEN KNOCK THE TOP OFF,

00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:08,154
PUT A WOODEN STRAW IN IT,
AND THAT WAS MY BREAKFAST.

00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,255
I LOVE THAT.

00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:11,992
SO, BECAUSE I'VE HAD EXPERIENCE
WITH THE COCONUT

00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,461
AND I FEEL THE CONNECTION,

00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:17,197
I'LL GIVE YOU $125,000
FOR 50%.

00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:18,465
FIVE-ZERO PERCENT?
YEAH.

00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:22,002
$125,000 FOR 50%?
CORRECT, ROBERT.

00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,103
GET THE MACHETE, DAVE!

00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:25,038
YOU'RE NOT A BUSINESS YET.
YOU'RE A PRODUCT.

00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:26,239
THERE'S A LOT
THAT CAN GO WRONG

00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,008
TURNING IT
INTO A BUSINESS.

00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,376
I THINK I'VE MADE YOU
A FAIR OFFER.

00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:31,411
I'VE GIVEN YOU $125,000
TO BECOME A PARTNER.

00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:33,146
HAS ANYBODY ELSE
STEPPED UP?

00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:35,448
SO, DAVE, OKAY.
SO, I LIKE THE IDEA.

00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,350
WHEN PEOPLE SOLVE PROBLEMS

00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,186
THAT NOBODY KNEW
NEEDED TO BE SOLVED...

00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,255
YEAH.
...INDUSTRIES ARE BORN.

00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,257
INDUSTRIES?
SHUT UP, SCOOBY-DOO.

00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:48,294
IF -- IF I SAY, "LOOK, WE CAN GO
AFTER BARS AND RESTAURANTS,

00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:50,196
BUT WE CAN'T
GO AFTER SOMETHING ELSE,"

00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,365
CAN YOU FOCUS
ON ONE THING AT A TIME?
ABSOLUTELY.

00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,267
DO YOU HAVE ANY DEBT
IN THE COMPANY NOW?

00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,236
ABOUT $13,000.

00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,972
OKAY.
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.

00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:02,108
I'LL GIVE YOU $125,000

00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:05,979
STRUCTURED AS CONVERTIBLE DEBT
WITH A 7% INTEREST RATE.

00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:07,113
WHAT THAT MEANS IS

00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:10,150
I'M NOT GONNA ASK YOU
TO PAY ME BACK INITIALLY, RIGHT?

00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:13,219
IT'S JUST GONNA
STAY ON YOUR BOOKS AS DEBT.
RIGHT.

00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,089
IF BUSINESS GOES GREAT,

00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:18,058
WE'LL CONVERT THAT TO EQUITY,

00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,427
AND I'LL JUST BE
AN EQUITY SHAREHOLDER.

00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:24,130
WHAT I WANT THAT TO CONVERT TO
IS 25% OF THE COMPANY.

00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,233
O'Leary:
DAVE, AND I JUST WANT YOU

00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,369
TO UNDERSTAND ONE THING
WITH CERTAINTY.

00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:33,073
IF THINGS DON'T GO WELL AND YOU
TAKE ON THAT CONVERTIBLE DEBT,

00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:36,142
YOUR PATENT AND THE OWNERSHIP
OF YOUR PRODUCT

00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:39,179
WILL REVERT
TO THAT CONVERTIBLE DEBT OWNER.

00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:42,949
MINE HAS NO DEBT COVENANTS.
WE'RE TOTALLY ALIGNED,

00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,284
100% ALIGNED AS PARTNERS.

00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:50,090
I DO WANT TO SEE
IF YOU'D BE INTERESTED

00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,225
IN GOING DOWN TO 20%
FOR THE EQUITY CONVERSION.

00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,029
NO.

00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:59,265
LOOK, YOU TAKE EQUITY,
OR YOU TAKE DEBT.

00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,104
ONE OTHER THING JUST TO ADD IN.

00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,272
DAVE, YOU GOT TO
CLOSE THE DEAL!

00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,976
YOU HAVE TO DECIDE.
ARE YOU TAKING DEBT OR EQUITY?

00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,077
THAT'S YOUR DECISION, DAVE.

00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,079
I THINK YOU'RE THE LUCKIEST MAN
IN THE WORLD.

00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,014
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU HAVE A SINGLE OFFER.

00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:17,417
SO, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO, DAVE?

00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,989
YEAH, I'LL TAKE IT.
I'LL TAKE IT. I'M SOLD.

00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,157
WE GOT A DEAL?
WE GOT A DEAL.

00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:25,425
LET'S DO IT.
DEAL.

00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,026
THANK YOU, MARK.

00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,161
APPRECIATE IT, BRO.
THANKS, BRO.

00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:29,462
WE'LL DO THIS.
COCONUTS FOREVER.
RIGHT ON.

00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,131
LATER, GUYS.
THANKS. YOU WERE AWESOME.

00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,298
GOOD LUCK.
ALL RIGHT!

00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,967
THANKS.

00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,969
IT'S BEEN A LONG
AND WINDING JOURNEY.

00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,037
I'VE DONE ALL KINDS OF THINGS
IN MY LIFE.

00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:40,006
I'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL
IN ALL OF THEM.

00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:42,408
AND THIS IS BRINGING ME
INTO THE PEER GROUP OF PEOPLE

00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:45,111
WHO ARE MASTER SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE
LIKE MARK.

00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,346
I'M REALLY EXCITED FOR THAT.

00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:57,056
Narrator:
NEXT INTO THE TANK IS A PRODUCT

00:10:57,056 --> 00:11:01,161
DESIGNED TO MAKE AN ACTIVITY
OF THE PAST MORE SAFE.

00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:07,200
HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS GEORGE CONWAY,

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,036
AND I'M FROM CHATTANOOGA,
TENNESSEE.

00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:12,138
MY COMPANY'S CALLED BedRyder.

00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:15,008
I'M SEEKING $200,000

00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:19,412
IN EXCHANGE FOR 15%
OF MY COMPANY.

00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:23,983
SHARKS, RIDING IN THE BACK
OF A PICKUP TRUCK --

00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:26,186
THERE IS NOTHING BETTER.

00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,021
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:33,026
THE PROBLEM IS,
IT'S JUST NOT SAFE UNTIL NOW.

00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,327
I love that accent.
NOW, KEEP IN MIND,

00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:38,097
I'M 53 YEARS OLD,
AND THIS IS NOT THAT BAD.

00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,399
WOW.

00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:43,036
JUST SLIDE THE SYSTEM
IN THE VERY BACK.

00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,070
POPS IN.

00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,405
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
IN THERE ALREADY

00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:47,073
THAT YOU'RE
ATTACHING IT TO?

00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:49,943
THERE'S THREE BOLTS
THAT ARE UNDERNEATH THE TRUCK.

00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:51,978
YOU HAVE TO DRILL SOME HOLES,
AND BOLTS ARE PUT IN.

00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:54,113
SO, YOU HAVE TO DRILL --
IN ORDER TO INSTALL THESE,

00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,115
YOU HAVE TO DRILL THESE HOLES?
YES, SIR.

00:11:56,115 --> 00:12:00,353
THE BedRyder SYSTEM ADDS THE
CONVENIENT SEATING OF AN S.U.V.

00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:02,222
TO THE ROLE
OF A PICKUP TRUCK,

00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:07,060
CREATING WHAT WE IN THE SOUTH
LIKE TO CALL A TRUCK-U.V.

00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,996
HOW COOL IS THAT?
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:11,130
THAT'S COOL.
YEE-HAW!

00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,066
THAT'S COOL, ISN'T IT?
A TRUCK-U.V.

00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,234
THINK ABOUT IT.

00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,402
YOU TAKE AN S.U.V. RIGHT HERE,
AND THIS IS THE TRUCK.

00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,105
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, THEY'RE
COMING TO AN INTERSECTION.

00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,139
THEY CRASH.

00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,108
THIS IS WHAT YOU GOT.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:24,010
THIS IS IT!

00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,312
HAVE YOU TESTED?
HAVE YOU DONE CRASH TESTING?

00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,181
I -- YOU WANT --
HONESTLY, YES.

00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:30,149
I HAVE DONE MY OWN
BY ACCIDENT. I WAS --

00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,452
BY ACCIDENT.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:35,321
WE WERE AT -- WE WENT TO
A NASCAR RACE DOWN IN ATLANTA.

00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:38,024
WHO'S "WE," GEORGE?
MY BEST FRIEND, KERRY.

00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:39,259
MM-HMM.
THE ACTUAL INVENTOR.

00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,327
AND HIS TWO SONS.
Herjavec: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:44,430
YOU'RE NOT THE INVENTOR?
I AM HIS BEST FRIEND.
I AM THE SALES MANAGER.

00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,967
Greiner: WAIT A MINUTE. I JUST
WANT TO HEAR WHAT HAPPENED --
ON THE ACCIDENT.

00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,036
THE CAR GOT DESTROYED
PRETTY GOOD.

00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:51,304
EVERYBODY WAS FINE
IN THE TRUCK.

00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:56,009
GEORGE, I SEE THE SKIES
RAINING DOWN WITH LITIGATION.

00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:58,077
THE FLAW IS,

00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:01,247
EVERYBODY THINKS IT'S ILLEGAL
TO RIDE IN THE BACK OF A PICKUP.

00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:04,017
I THOUGHT IT WAS.
QUITE FRANKLY, IT IS.

00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:05,285
HOWEVER --
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:09,155
HOWEVER, IT IS ILLEGAL TO RIDE
IN THE BACK OF A PICKUP TRUCK

00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,057
UNRESTRAINED.

00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:13,326
WE'VE HAD IT
INDEPENDENTLY TESTED,

00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:17,397
AND IT MEETS AND EXCEEDS
ALL FEDERAL GUIDELINES.

00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:19,165
YOU ARE COMPLETELY LEGAL.

00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,400
EVERY STATE?

00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,068
EVERY STATE IN THE COUNTRY.

00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:24,270
Cuban: WELL, LET'S ASK
THE OBVIOUS QUESTIONS.

00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,972
SO, HOW MUCH HAVE YOU SOLD?

00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,974
HOW MANY STATES
HAVE YOU SOLD THEM IN?

00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,108
HOW ARE YOU SELLING THEM?

00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:32,145
I'VE SOLD 800 UNITS SO FAR
ON THE INTERNET.

00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,347
Corcoran: OVER WHAT PERIOD
OF TIME WERE THOSE SALES?

00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:36,049
FOUR YEARS.

00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:37,317
Herjavec:
WOW, THAT'S LOW.

00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:41,054
WHERE IS THE INVENTOR?
WHY ISN'T HE HERE?
THE INVENTOR, KERRY HIDE,

00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:44,057
HAS BEEN MY BEST FRIEND
SINCE WE WERE 7 YEARS OLD.

00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:47,327
KERRY HANDLES
ALL OF THE OPERATIONS.

00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,262
HE GETS THE CHAIRS ASSEMBLED,

00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:51,197
GETS THEM BROUGHT
TO OUR PLACE IN ATLANTA.

00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,066
THEN I'M THE PERSON
IN CHARGE OF ALL THE SALES.

00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:55,034
OKAY, SO KERRY
STARTED THE COMPANY

00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:56,235
AND OWNS WHAT PERCENTAGE?

00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,304
HE OWNS 85% OF THE COMPANY.
Corcoran: OHH.

00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:01,174
BUT DO YOU HAVE
THE OTHER 15%?
DID YOU GET THE 15%?

00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,442
YES, I HAVE THE 15%.
YES.

00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:05,278
THE TRUTH IS THIS BUSINESS
REALLY CAN'T SUPPORT BOTH OF YOU

00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:06,412
OR EITHER ONE OF YOU.

00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:11,017
NOW, THERE'S A HUGE INDUSTRY
SELLING AFTERMARKET PRODUCTS

00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:14,087
TO GUYS WHO HAVE PICKUP TRUCKS
ALL OVER AMERICA.

00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:17,256
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE THESE
AVAILABLE THERE?

00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,425
SINCE I'VE COME ABOARD
SIX MONTHS AGO,

00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:22,195
I HAVE ACTUALLY WORKED
WITH AN ONLINE COMPANY

00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:26,299
THAT THAT'S THEIR BIGGEST THING
IS TRUCK ACCESSORIES.

00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:28,334
IN FACT, WE JUST SIGNED A DEAL
WITH THEM.

00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:31,104
SO, GEORGE, IS THAT HOW
YOU'RE GONNA GROW THE BUSINESS?

00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:32,372
IS THAT HOW
YOU'RE GONNA SCALE?

00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,107
I HAVE FIVE DIFFERENT OTHER WAYS

00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:36,042
THAT I AM GOING TO GROW
THIS COMPANY.

00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,377
THE FIRST
IS I HAVE 800 PEOPLE

00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:41,114
WHO INVESTED IN MY COMPANY
AND BOUGHT MY UNITS FROM ME.

00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:43,015
SO, BASICALLY,
I'M CALLING ALL THESE CUSTOMERS,

00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:46,219
AND I'M OFFERING THEM INCENTIVE
TO BECOME MY SALES REPS.

00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,055
THEY'RE GONNA GET $100
FOR EVERY SALE THAT THEY MAKE.

00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,189
I <i>LOVE</i>
THE WAY YOU SELL, GEORGE.

00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:52,058
YOU ARE A GOOD SALESPERSON.
Corcoran: VERY GOOD.

00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,326
Herjavec:
WHERE ARE YOU MAKING THESE?

00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:54,427
EVERYTHING IS MADE IN AMERICA.

00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:57,063
THE FRAME IS WHAT
WE MANUFACTURE.

00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,065
WE GET THE SEATS AND THE COVERS
FROM ATLANTA.

00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,000
WE GET THE HARNESSES SENT IN

TO MAKE ONE?

00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,170

00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:07,273
I SELL THEM FOR $699 A SET.

00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:10,276
GEORGE, IT'S A GREAT IDEA.
BUT HERE'S THE PROBLEM.

00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:13,012
IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE, MY FRIEND.
IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE.

00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:17,116
YOU'VE GOT TO BE MANUFACTURING
THIS FOR, LIKE, 100 BUCKS

00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:18,985
TO PUT IT INTO WHOLESALE
AT $300

00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:21,487
IN ORDER TO SELL IT AT RETAIL
AT $500 TO $600.

00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:24,257
EXACTLY.
SO, HOW ARE YOU GONNA DO THAT?

00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,992
HOW AM I GONNA DO THAT?

00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:27,226
I HAVE THE ANSWER
TO THAT QUESTION, BY THE WAY.

00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:28,361
HALLELUJAH!
HALLELUJAH.

00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:32,198
I WILL BUY 1,000 UNITS.
IF I GET $200,000,

00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:37,003
I WILL SPEND IT AND BUY 1,000
UNITS, AND I WILL RE-NEGOTIATE,

00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:39,372
AND I WILL BRING MY PRICE
DOWN TO $200 A UNIT.

00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:43,276
YOU KNOW, I WORRY ABOUT CRASHES,
AND I WORRY ABOUT ROLL-OVERS.

00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,044
FOR ME,
I CAN'T GET PAST THAT.

00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,146
SO FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.

THAT MY DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN,

WHEN YOU LEAVE THE TANK,

00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,299
TO TAKE THAT TRUCK

I'D LIKE YOU
TO GET RID OF THIS THING

00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:20,046
SO YOU CAN GO SELL SOMETHING
WHERE YOU MAKE A LOT OF MONEY.

WHEN THE NEXT ORDER IS COMING

OR AT WHAT FLOW
THEY'RE GONNA COME.

00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,374
THAT MEANS YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO ALWAYS HAVE

00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,276
TOO MUCH MONEY
SUNK INTO INVENTORY,

00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:52,178
WHICH MAKES IT
FAR MORE DIFFICULT

THAT WE WERE GONNA
START A FAMILY.

00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:11,049
WE HAD TROUBLE
CONCEIVING.

00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:13,151
WE ENDED UP GOING TO
FERTILITY TREATMENTS.

00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:16,088
AND OUR TWINS WERE BORN, AND
THEY'RE THE LIGHT OF OUR LIVES.

00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:19,024
I THINK MY LIGHT-BULB MOMENT
WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,

00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:21,059
TRYING TO FEED TWO BABIES
AT ONE TIME.

00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,395
I WAS HAVING A REAL HARD TIME
GETTING THE BABIES POSITIONED,

00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:26,064
AND I JUST COULDN'T FIND
ANYTHING THAT WAS WORKING.

00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:27,399
AND SO I THINK
IT'S JUST OUT OF NECESSITY

00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:30,135
THAT YOU END UP
COMING UP WITH SOMETHING.

00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:32,237
WHEN THE GIRLS WERE YOUNG,
JASON AND I GOT A PHONE CALL

00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:34,339
THAT THEY WERE HAVING LAYOFFS
AT OUR COMPANY.

00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:37,376
WE LOST EVERYTHING.
IT WAS SCARY.

00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:39,311
IT WAS VERY SCARY,
AND WE NEEDED MONEY.

00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:41,980
AND THAT'S WHEN WE DECIDED
TO TAKE A LEAP OF FAITH.

00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,415
DO YOU LIKE THE LIGHT PINK,
OR DO YOU LIKE THE DARKER PINK?

00:29:43,415 --> 00:29:45,384
THERE'S SO MANY
MOMS OF TWINS.

00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:48,120
IT'S REALLY A GROWING POPULATION
OF BABIES.

00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,254
Jason:
WE'VE REACHED A POINT

00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:51,390
WHERE WE NEED SOME GUIDANCE
AND SOME FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE

00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,292
TO REALLY GET THIS THING
TO TAKE OFF.

00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:56,461
WE KNOW WE HAVE A PERFECT
PRODUCT FOR A GROWING MARKET,

00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,130
AND WE CAN BRING
A LITTLE COMFORT

00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,098
TO FAMILIES
OF TWINS EVERYWHERE.

00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:13,111
HI, MY NAME'S MICHELLE.

00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:14,446
AND I'M HER HUSBAND,
JASON.

00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:17,149
OUR COMPANY
IS THE TWIN Z PILLOW.

00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,250
WE ARE SEEKING $75,000

00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,986
IN EXCHANGE
FOR A 10% SHARE IN OUR COMPANY.

00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:22,988
SHARKS, DID YOU KNOW
THAT IT CAN TAKE

00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:26,358
A MOM OF MULTIPLES OVER 12 HOURS
A DAY TO FEED HER BABIES?

00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:29,428
ONE INFANT FEEDS
30 TO 45 MINUTES AT TIME

00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:33,332
12 TIMES A DAY,
AND THAT'S DOUBLE FOR TWINS.

00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:35,100
WHEN I HAD MY TWINS,

00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,401
I SEARCHED AND SEARCHED
FOR SOMETHING

00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:39,171
TO HELP ME FEED THE BABIES,
BUT I COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING

00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:41,340
THAT WAS COMFORTABLE
OR FIT MY BODY.

00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,076
SO, I TOOK MY MOM'S
30-YEAR-OLD SEWING MACHINE

00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:46,244
AND CAME UP
WITH THE FIRST TWIN Z PILLOW.

00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:49,348
THIS IS HOW
THE TWIN Z PILLOW WORKS.

00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:54,319
SHARKS, A TWIN Z PILLOW
IS THE FIRST PILLOW

00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,022
DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY
FOR MOMS OF MULTIPLES.

00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,256
AS YOU CAN SEE HERE,

00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:00,425
MOM CAN BOTTLE-FEED
OR BREAST-FEED TWO BABIES

00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:03,428
AT ONE TIME, CUTTING THOSE
FEEDING TIMES IN HALF,

00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:06,231
LEAVING MOM AN EXTRA SIX HOURS
IN HER DAY.

00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:09,101
AND THE TWIN Z PILLOW HAS A VERY
UNIQUE BACK SUPPORT SYSTEM

00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:11,069
UNLIKE ANY OTHER PILLOW
ON THE MARKET.

00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:14,072
NO MORE HUNCHING OVER
WITH NECK AND BACK PAIN FOR MOM.

00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:15,440
SO, SHARKS,
WE'LL HELP YOU

00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,210
DOUBLE YOUR MONEY
IF YOU JOIN OUR...

00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:21,980
DOUBLE TROUBLE TWIN-TASTIC
TWIN Z PILLOW TEAM.

00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,149
MICHELLE, WHY WOULDN'T
TWO PILLOWS WORK HERE?

00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:27,119
WELL, BETWEEN PROPPING UP
WITH YOUR BACK,

00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:31,089
AND PROPPING UP ON THE SIDES,
AND THE BABIES ROLL OFF,

00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:33,225
THERE'S A LOT OF LOGISTICS
THAT GO INTO HAVING TWO INFANTS.

00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,127
AND ALSO,
WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT THIS PILLOW

00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:37,162
IS PREGNANT MOMS, BEFORE
THEY'VE EVEN HAD THE BABIES,

00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:38,363
THEY SIT IN IT LIKE A CHAIR,

00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:40,999
BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF
BACK PAIN WHEN YOU'RE PREGNANT.

00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:43,101
O'Leary: MY GREAT CONCERN
ABOUT THIS CONCEPT

00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:45,070
IS WE HAVE TO FIND
PARENTS WITH TWINS,

00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,105
WHICH IS SOME SUBSET
OF A SUBSET

00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:49,374
OF THE POPULATION
THAT HAPPEN TO BE HAVING BABIES.

00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:51,209
IN THE UNITED STATES,

00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:54,079
THERE'S 135,000 TWINS
BORN EVERY YEAR.

00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,248
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT HAVE YOU SOLD, MICHELLE?

00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:59,251
THIS YEAR, WE'RE ON TRACK
TO DO $510,000.

00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:00,352
$510,000.

00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:01,420
REALLY?
YEP.

00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,155
YEAR-TO-DATE,
WE'RE AT $300,000.

00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:05,023
AND HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN IN BUSINESS?
2 1/2 YEARS.

00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:06,391
Herjavec: WHAT DOES IT SELL FOR?
$99.99.

00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:08,126
WHOA.

00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:10,061
Greiner: HOW MUCH DOES IT
COST YOU TO MAKE ONE?
$29.

00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:11,430
Herjavec: WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'LL SELL NEXT YEAR?

00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,432
$1.2 MILLION
TO $1.5 MILLION.

00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:16,168
WOW, YOU'RE VERY CONFIDENT.
WHAT DO YOU BASE THAT ON?

00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:18,403
BASED ON OUR SALES,
WE DOUBLE EVERY NINE MONTHS.

00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:20,439
ALL RIGHT, SO
HOW'D YOU COME UP WITH THIS?

00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:23,375
MY HUSBAND AND I BOTH GOT
LAID OFF AT OUR CORPORATE JOBS,

00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:25,243
AND --
WHAT DID YOU USED TO DO?

00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:27,112
WE WERE BOTH
IN PHARMACEUTICAL SALES.

00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:28,413
YEAH.
SO, WHEN WE LOST OUR JOBS,

00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:31,149
WE HAD NO CARS. WE HAD
NO PHONES. WE HAD NOTHING.

00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:33,385
SO I WENT TO WASHING CARS
FOR A FRIEND OF MINE

00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:35,187
WHILE I WAS
LOOKING FOR WORK.

00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:38,023
AND ALL HER FRIENDS
KEPT COMING OVER AND SAYING,

00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:39,291
"YOU SHOULD REALLY
PATENT THAT PILLOW."

00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,026
AND SHE GOES,
"THIS IS A GREAT TIME.

00:32:41,026 --> 00:32:42,227
I'M GONNA STAY HOME
WITH THE GIRLS."

00:32:42,227 --> 00:32:45,063
GOOD FOR YOU, BECAUSE THERE'S
GONNA BE PEOPLE WATCHING AT HOME

00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,364
THAT ARE IN SIMILAR
CIRCUMSTANCES,

00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:48,333
THINKING, "IF I ONLY
KNEW SOMEBODY, IF I ONLY

00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:50,335
HAD CAPITAL AVAILABLE."
YOU DIDN'T KNOW ANYBODY.

00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:53,071
YOU PUT IT ALL ON THE LINE,
AND YOU WENT FOR IT.

00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:54,406
THANK YOU.
THAT'S THE AMERICAN DREAM,

00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:56,308
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHY WE DO THIS SHOW.

00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:58,343
DID YOU SAY
WHERE YOU'RE MANUFACTURING?

00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:00,378
Michelle:
WE MANUFACTURE IN THE U.S.

00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:02,080
THE PILLOWS
ARE MADE IN GEORGIA.

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,049
THE COVERS ARE MADE
IN MASSACHUSETTS RIGHT NOW.

00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:06,017
SO, HOW MANY PROTOTYPES
DID YOU GO THROUGH?

00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:07,285
AND TELL ME
ABOUT THE PROCESS.

00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:09,187
I TOOK MY MOM'S
SEWING MACHINE.

00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:10,455
DID YOUR MOM
HELP YOU SEW THEM?

00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:12,224
NO, UNFORTUNATELY,
MY MOM,

00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:14,125
SHE HAD PASSED AWAY
BY THE TIME --

00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:15,160
I'M SORRY.

00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,394
RIGHT BEFORE
THE GIRLS WERE BORN,

00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:21,066
WE HAD GONE THROUGH A LOT
OF IVF TREATMENTS, AND WE HAD --

00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:23,034
WE HAD A LOT OF LOSSES.
WE HAD A LOT OF LOSSES.

00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:26,071
AND I JUST SAID,
"I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE."

00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:28,139
IT WAS LITERALLY
THE LOWEST TIME IN MY LIFE.

00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:31,209
COME TO FIND OUT THAT MY MOM,
AFTER HAVING M.S. FOR 35 YEARS,

00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:33,211
WAS DIAGNOSED
WITH PANCREATIC CANCER.

00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:35,146
I'M SORRY.
SO, WE SAID, YOU KNOW,

00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:38,183
IF WE HAVE ONE CHANCE
OF HER MEETING HER GRANDCHILD,

00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:42,053
WE'D TRY IT ONE MORE TIME.
AND, SO, WE DID, AND --

00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:43,221
WE GOT PREGNANT
WITH ABBY AND EMMA.

00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:44,222
YEAH.
NOW THEY'RE 5.

00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:45,457
SHE MADE IT TO SEE THEM.

00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:48,226
SHE LIVED A GREAT,
WONDERFUL FOUR MONTHS,

00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:50,228
AND I KEPT
HER SEWING MACHINE.

00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:52,130
YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING
ENTREPRENEURS.

00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,065
THANK YOU.
YOU GUYS ARE
THE AMERICAN DREAM

00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:55,467
AND DESERVE
EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE EARNED.

00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:57,102
THANK YOU.

00:33:57,102 --> 00:33:58,436
BUT IT'S JUST NOT A FIT
FOR WHAT I DO,

00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,372
AND SO, FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.

00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,107
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

00:34:02,107 --> 00:34:04,242
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME, MARK.
THANK YOU FOR THE KIND WORDS.

00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:06,144
OH, NO.
YOU EARNED IT.
THANK YOU.

00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:09,281
JASON, I'M CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA DO WITH THE MONEY.

00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:13,018
SO, BIG-BOX RETAILER CALLED US
ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO.

00:34:13,018 --> 00:34:14,119
buybuy BABY.
buybuy BABY.

00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:16,154
THEY SAID THEY'D LIKE
TO START IT OUT ONLINE,

00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:18,023
BUT PROBABLY
BRING IT INTO THE STORE.

00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:19,424
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES,
WHEN YOU HAVE

00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:22,027
A VERY NICHE-ORIENTED PRODUCT
LIKE THIS...

00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:24,329
YEAH.
...GOING INTO GENERAL RETAIL
ISN'T ALWAYS --

00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:27,198
RIGHT. RIGHT.
...I MEAN, I HATE
TO SAY NO TO ORDERS...

00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:29,034
NO, WE AGREE.
...BUT I GOT TO TELL YOU,

00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:31,303
IF I'M MAKING GOOD MONEY, $26,
SELLING IT FOR $99 --

00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:34,239
THAT WAS OUR THOUGHT.
...AND YOUR CUSTOMERS
ARE FINDING YOU,

00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,942
I DON'T KNOW IF GOING TO RETAIL
IS THE RIGHT APPROACH.

00:34:36,942 --> 00:34:38,276
I DON'T KNOW
IF I AGREE WITH THAT.

00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:40,979
I COULD EASILY SEE THIS
IN A MASS MARKET LIKE WALMART.

00:34:40,979 --> 00:34:42,213
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.
EASILY. WHY NOT?

00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:44,349
I AGREE WITH BARB. I THINK YOU
SHOULD BE EVERYWHERE YOU CAN BE.

00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:46,384
NO, I THINK
YOU'RE WRONG.
I THINK THAT'S A MISTAKE.

00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:48,153
I DON'T SEE
WHY YOU WOULD HOLD IT BACK.

00:34:48,153 --> 00:34:49,321
YOU CAN SELL IT
ON YOUR WEBSITE,

00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:51,056
BUT YOU CAN ALSO
BE IN RETAILERS.

00:34:51,056 --> 00:34:52,390
YOU'RE GONNA DOUBLE OR TRIPLE
YOUR MONEY.

00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,993
O'Leary: ALL RIGHT, GUYS, LOOK.
I'LL GIVE YOU AN OFFER.

00:34:54,993 --> 00:34:58,129
BUT 10% DOES NOT GET ME EXCITED
ABOUT EQUITY AT ALL.

00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:02,467
SO, THE WAY I LOOK AT IT
IS I'LL GIVE YOU $75,000.

00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:06,237
I WANT A $10 ROYALTY

00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:08,406
UNTIL I'M PAID BACK $225,000.

00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:13,078
SO, THREE TIMES ON MY MONEY,
THEN MY ROYALTY GOES AWAY.

00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:15,313
AND TO INITIATE
THIS RELATIONSHIP,

00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:17,015
I WANT 2.5% EQUITY.

00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,119
THAT'S CALLED
A PACT WITH THE DEVIL.

00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,188
Jason:
$10 OFF OF EACH SALE?
YES.

00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:25,056
WHAT HAPPENS
AFTER YOU GET YOUR $225,000?

00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,359
IT'S GONE. YOU DON'T PAY ME
ANYTHING ANYMORE.
THEN HE EATS YOUR CHILDREN.

00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,395
Herjavec:
WELL, ACTUALLY, I'M GONNA
DO SOMETHING I'VE NEVER DONE.

00:35:30,395 --> 00:35:32,998
I'M GONNA MAKE
A ROYALTY OFFER.

00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:36,201
AFTER SIX SEASONS, I'VE LEARNED
HOW THEY WORK FROM KEVIN.

00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:38,169
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $75,000.

00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:42,073
I WANT THE SAME $10 PER UNIT,

00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:45,076
BUT I ONLY WANT TO GET PAID BACK
TWICE THE AMOUNT

00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:47,178
AS OPPOSED TO
KEVIN'S THREE TIMES.

00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:53,051
SO, AT $150,000,
AND THE SAME 2.5% FOR EQUITY.

00:35:53,051 --> 00:35:55,286
THAT'S MY OFFER.

00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:57,455
IT'S SIMILAR TO KEVIN'S,
BUT OBVIOUSLY MUCH BETTER.

00:35:57,455 --> 00:35:59,057
RIGHT.

00:35:59,057 --> 00:36:01,226
NO OFFER FROM THE LADIES,
AND MARK'S OUT.

00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:03,995
WELL, I THINK
YOU SHOULD PUT THEIR DEALS

00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:07,132

KEVIN'S GETTING
CONTAGIOUS HERE.

00:36:44,102 --> 00:36:45,270

Greiner:
ONCE I'M PAID BACK THE $150,000,

00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,976
THEN I'LL TAKE
A 5% EQUITY STAKE,

'CAUSE I WANT TO HAVE
SKIN IN THE GAME.

I HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP
WITH buybuy BABY,

THAT YOU SHOULD BE EVERYWHERE.

Corcoran:
I RESPECT LORI'S OFFER,

00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:08,359
BUT I'D LIKE TO COMPETE
WITH THE OFFER.

00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:10,428
Michelle: OKAY.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU $75,000,

00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:13,064
BUT I MUST ASK
FOR 20% OF THE BUSINESS.

00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,133
BUT I'D LIKE
TO EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY.

00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:17,435
WHEN I'VE BEEN INVOLVED
IN A 10% OWNERSHIP

00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:19,938
WITH ANY OF THE BUSINESSES,

00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:22,207
AS MUCH AS I LOVE
MY ENTREPRENEURS,

00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:26,044
AFTER A WHILE, THAT 10%
LOOKS SMALLER AND SMALLER

00:37:26,044 --> 00:37:29,314
AS I'M WORKING MY BUNS OFF
TO PUSH THAT BUSINESS AHEAD.

00:37:29,314 --> 00:37:32,317
SO, NOW I'D LIKE
TO PLAN FOR THE LONG HAUL.

00:37:32,317 --> 00:37:34,319
TO LORI'S POINT
ABOUT GETTING IN RETAIL,

00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:38,156
I WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE.

00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:40,225
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THE GUYS' PRESENTATION

00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:42,260
ABOUT JUST KEEPING IT ONLINE

00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,130
IS ALL THE JOY
OF BUILDING A BUSINESS

00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:47,198
IS TO DREAM
AND SEE HOW FAR YOU COULD GO.

00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:48,967
Herjavec:
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:51,002
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO ELIMINATE
MOST OF THE UNIVERSE?

00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,103
BARBARA, YOU'RE VERY CONFUSED,
BECAUSE

00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,038
YOU KEEP FORGETTING RETAIL'S AT
HALF THE MARGIN,

00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:56,274
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE CAPITAL
TIED UP IN RETAIL.
YOU KNOW WHAT'S KEY IN RETAIL?

00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,309
NO. YOU KNOW --
YOU'RE TYING UP CAPITAL
IN RETAIL.

00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:00,311
HEY.
I CAN PROVIDE THAT FUNDING.

00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:02,013
BUT YOU TOOK A SHOT
AT MY DEAL,

00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:03,248
AND YOU HAVE TO PAY THE PRICE
FOR THAT.

00:38:03,248 --> 00:38:04,449
YOUR DEAL IS ROBBERY.

00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:06,217
SO, LOOK,
AS A MATTER OF FACT --

00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:08,153
HE'S SUCH A SHORT MAN.
THEY ALWAYS ARE PUSHY.

00:38:08,153 --> 00:38:10,054
...HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO HAVE TWO SHARKS

00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:11,189
INSTEAD OF
ONE NOISY ONE?

00:38:11,189 --> 00:38:13,091
I'M GONNA PROPOSE
TO ROBERT RIGHT NOW

00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:15,226
THAT HE COMES INTO MY DEAL
UNDER THE SAME TERMS

00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:18,163
THAT I ORIGINALLY PROPOSED SO
I'M NOT COMPETING WITH MYSELF.

00:38:18,163 --> 00:38:19,264
NOW YOU HAVE <i>TWO</i> SHARKS.

00:38:19,264 --> 00:38:22,200
KEVIN, I LIKE THE OFFER,
OBVIOUSLY.

00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,203
IT'S RICHER THAN MINE,
SO WHY <i>WOULDN'T</i> I LIKE IT?

00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:27,205
BUT CALL A SPADE A SPADE.

00:38:27,205 --> 00:38:28,940
IT'S NOT AS GOOD
AS LORI'S OFFER.

00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,242
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
UP THE MONEY.
LORI'S A SINGLE SHARKETTE.

00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:34,112
BESIDES,
HE TOTALLY DOESN'T SEE
WE'RE TWO SHARKS.

00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:37,115
THAT A MAN WITH MONEY IS NO
MATCH FOR A WOMAN ON A MISSION.

00:38:37,115 --> 00:38:38,283
WHAT I'M SUGGESTING,
KEVIN,

00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:40,318
IS WE GO WITH TERMS
OF YOUR OFFER.

00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,987
YES.
WE SIMPLY BUMP THE MONEY
TO $75,000 EACH.

00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,122
DONE.

00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:47,025
KEVIN AND I ARE GONNA OFFER
$150,000 IN TOTAL,

00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:48,459
$10 OFF EVERY PILLOW.

00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:51,095
ONCE WE'RE PAID BACK
TIMES THREE,

00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:53,398
IT CONVERTS
TO 2.5% EQUITY.

00:38:53,398 --> 00:38:57,101
MICHELLE AND JASON,
CAN I SAY WHAT IS WRONG

00:38:57,101 --> 00:39:00,004
WITH ALL OF THE DEALS
ON THE TABLE OTHER THAN MINE?

00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,040
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH SKIN
IN THE GAME.

00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,976
AND YOU'RE THE PRINCIPALS
OF THE BUSINESS.

00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:07,312
WHATEVER YOU DON'T
FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH, FINE.

00:39:07,312 --> 00:39:11,015
I ROLL OVER.
BUT WHAT I CAN GIVE TO YOU,

00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:15,420
WHICH IS TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT,
IS A LONG-TERM PARTNERSHIP.

00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:18,256
WHICH IS WHAT
I WOULD GIVE YOU, TOO.
EXCUSE ME, I'M NOT FINISHED.

INTO ALL MY ENTREPRENEURS.

TO ALL MY ENTREPRENEURS, TOO.

YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO?
Herjavec: EACH?

00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,354
I COULD BE WRONG HERE.

00:39:49,354 --> 00:39:51,990

OKAY. MY OFFER IS THIS.

00:39:58,296 --> 00:40:02,267

FOR A 20% EQUITY STAKE.

00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:04,969

THE SAME THING I OFFERED.

ALL RIGHT, LET'S JUST RECAP.

00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:12,143

HAVE SUGGESTED $75,000 FOR 20%

00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:16,414

00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:20,385
THE OTHER, FROM ROBERT AND I --
WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU $150,000

00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:25,356
AGAINST A $10 ROYALTY
UNTIL WE GET BACK EACH $225,000,

00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:27,258
WHICH IS THREE TIMES
ON OUR MONEY,

00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:31,296
AND WE'RE ONLY TAKING
FROM THE BUSINESS 2.5% EQUITY,

00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:33,298
WHICH I THINK IS VERY FAIR,
ACTUALLY.

00:40:33,298 --> 00:40:36,200

FROM BOTH SIDES.
