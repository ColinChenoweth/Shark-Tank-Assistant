SEEK AN INVESTMENT

00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:07,975

THEIR BUSINESS.

00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,142

YOU'RE AMAZING.
I'M VERY IMPRESSED.

00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:13,814

00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:15,549
I THINK
IT'S THE POWER OF YOU.

00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:18,652
Narrator: IF THE SHARKS HEAR
A GREAT IDEA...

00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:20,287
...THEY'LL INVEST
THEIR OWN MONEY...

00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:21,989

YOU'RE THE REAL DEAL.

00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:23,490
YOU ARE PROBABLY
THE BEST ENTREPRENEUR

00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,126
YOU UNDERSTAND THE OFFERS?
$20 MILLION VALUATION.

00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,496
Narrator: ...AND FIGHT EACH
OTHER FOR A DEAL.

00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,398
YOU SAID IT WASN'T
ABOUT THE MONEY.

00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:33,000
THEY KEEP ON RESPONDING
BASED OFF THE MONEY.

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,701
OH, THAT'S CRAP.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,304
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
Narrator: BUT THE ENTREPRENEURS
MUST GET THE FULL AMOUNT

00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:40,541
THEY'RE ASKING FOR, OR THEY'LL
WALK AWAY WITH NOTHING.

00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:43,944
ONE MOMENT IT WAS THERE,
AND THEN POOF, YOU LOSE A DEAL.

00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:44,978
NO, I'M SERIOUS.

00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:46,713

THANK YOU.
HAVE A GREAT DAY.

00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,687
I ACTUALLY PITCHED MY BUSINESS
ON "SHARK TANK"

00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:03,123
A YEAR AND A HALF AGO
AND WALKED AWAY WITHOUT A DEAL.

00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,293
I CAN'T CALL YOUR BUSINESS PLAN
BAD BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ONE.

00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:09,363
YOU MAKE A GREAT PRODUCT, BUT
YOU'RE COMING IN UNPREPARED.

00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:11,198

I'M OUT.

Alwan: I KEPT MY CHIN HIGH, BUT
INSIDE, IT WAS GUT-WRENCHING.

00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:16,670
I TRULY DIDN'T HAVE
A GOOD ENOUGH BUSINESS PLAN.

00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,339
I KNEW I HAD TO GO BACK
AND DIG DEEP INTO MY COMPANY,

00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:22,209
FIGURE OUT ALL MY COSTS, AND
COME UP WITH A BUSINESS PLAN,

00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:23,610
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I DID.

SO, WE FINALLY GOT THIS REPORT
BACK FROM THE UNIVERSITY,

00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:28,315
AND NOW WE KNOW WHAT IT ENTAILS
TO ACQUIRE A NEW CUSTOMER.

NOW THAT I HAVE
THE MARKETING SIDE DOWN

00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,986
AND MY CUSTOMER-ACQUISITION
COSTS DOWN, I KNOW MY NUMBERS.

00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,154

I'M COMING BACK IN THE TANK

00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:36,490
BECAUSE I WANT A DEAL.

00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,759
MORE IMPORTANTLY,
I WANT A SHARK AS A PARTNER.

THE BEST OF ME

AND REALIZED THE ONE OPPORTUNITY
I HAVE TO SCALE

00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:44,151
IS THE MAIL-ORDER INDUSTRY.

00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:46,019
IT'S NOT MY RETAIL,
AND IT'S NOT MY CATERING.

00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,088
WE DECIDED TO SPLIT
THE MAIL-ORDER OFF

00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:49,623
INTO ITS OWN ENTITY NOW.

00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:53,160

WAS ROUGHLY $190,000.

OH!

00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,999

JUST THE MAIL-ORDER ALONE.

ARE YOU SELLING US TODAY
JUST THE MAIL-ORDER?

00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:01,868
JUST THE MAIL-ORDER,

00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,737
WHICH I FEEL HAS
THE MOST POTENTIAL TO SCALE.

00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:05,172
AH. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE ASKING
FOR LESS MONEY.

AS I RECALL, LAST TIME
YOU WERE HERE, DAVE,

00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,142
WHERE YOU RAN INTO PROBLEMS

00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,144
WASN'T NECESSARILY
JUST VALUATION.

00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,946
YOU DIDN'T KNOW
YOUR CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COSTS.

00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:14,781
KEVIN, THAT NUMBER IS $12,

00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,049
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,

00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:17,784
IT ONLY COSTS $1
TO RETAIN THAT CUSTOMER.

00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,152
WE'VE HAD GREAT RETENTION --

00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,255
BETWEEN 35% AND 40% HAVE CAME
BACK AND ORDERED MULTIPLE TIMES,

00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:23,323

WILL THE MAIL-ORDER DIVISION

00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:37,704
THAT YOU'RE SELLING
THIS EQUITY IN GENERATE?

00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,673

ABOUT $1.8 MILLION

12%, 15%.

00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,686
IT DOES NOT NET QUITE AS MUCH
AS THE MAIL-ORDER BUSINESS.

00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:56,289
RETAIL IS ABOUT 10% TO 12%.
MAIL-ORDER'S 18.3%.

OF MY ISSUES WAS COMPETITION,

REALLY BIG OFFERS.

00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:14,341

00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:16,376

CUSTOMERS THAT WAY.
IT'S VERY COMPELLING.

00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,144
Alwan: AND THAT'S WHAT
I'M GONNA DO WITH THE MONEY.

00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:19,779
IT GIVES ME A LITTLE BIT BETTER
BUYING POWER.

00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:22,148
PRIME RIBS AND HAMS
DIP AFTER EASTER

00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:25,285
BECAUSE NOBODY'S GONNA BUY
THOSE AGAIN UNTIL CHRISTMAS,

00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:27,787
SO WHEN THE MARKET SOFTENS,
I CAN THEN TAKE THAT CASH

00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:29,489
AND GET ALL OF MY INVENTORY
BOUGHT IN

00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:30,790
AT A LOWER TIME OF THE YEAR

00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,659
BECAUSE I KNOW THE MARKET
SO WELL.

00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:35,095

CAN YOU BUY INVENTORY AHEAD?

00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:36,897

THEY DON'T REALLY LIKE ANYTHING

00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,098

REALLY MY RULE OF THUMB.

10th MONTH VERSUS THE 6th MONTH,

00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,804
DOES THE QUALITY CHANGE?

00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,973

INTO OUR FREEZER.

BUILDING YOUR BUSINESS
THAT BIG IN JUST A YEAR.

00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,050

I LOVE PEOPLE
THAT LEARN FROM THEIR MISTAKES,

00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:04,291
BUT THERE'S ONE
LITTLE PROBLEM I HAVE.

00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,559
BECAUSE I'M NOT
A BIG MEAT EATER,

00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,995
I DON'T THINK
I'M THE BEST PARTNER

00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,430
WE'VE CREATED THE FORMAT.

00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,731
THEY COMPETE HEAD TO HEAD.

00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:33,332
WHAT IS THE ESSENCE
OF THE SPORT?

00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,067
LIKE, HOW DO I WIN?
Cuban: IT'S A PERFORMANCE.

00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:36,402
WHOEVER PUTS ON THE BEST
PERFORMANCE, RIGHT?

00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:37,804
EXACTLY.

00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:39,005
BASICALLY, THIS IS
BREAK DANCING...

00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:41,507
BREAK DANCING WITH A GREAT
PRODUCT TO FUND IT.

00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,142
THAT YOU CAN SELL, YEAH.
THAT YOU CAN SELL.

00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,544
WHEN BREAK DANCING
CAME OUT,

00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:47,313
THIS IS BASICALLY THE FEEL
AND THE ENERGY OF THAT.

00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:48,881
IT'S AN UNDERGROUND SWELL.

00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,451
EXACTLY.
THERE ARE CREWS,
YOU KNOW, AGAINST CREWS.

00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,953
THERE ARE FANS.
BRIAN, YOU'RE CREATING
YOUR OWN INDUSTRY.

00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,690
THE GREAT THING ABOUT GLOVING IS
THAT IT'S NOT GENRE-SPECIFIC.

00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,559
IT HAS GROWN
OUT OF THE EDM SCENE,

00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:02,595
BUT IT'S GROWING INTO HIP-HOP
AND ALL OTHER TYPES OF MUSIC.

00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:05,198
THE BOTTOM LINE IS ANYONE
THAT SEES GLOVING

00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:07,099
THINKS
IT'S AUTOMATICALLY COOL.

00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:11,003
IT'S NOW MY JOB TO GET IT IN
FRONT OF MILLIONS OF EYEBALLS,

00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:13,139
AND I'M VERY,
VERY CONFIDENT

00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,141
THAT WE CAN BUILD GLOVING
INTO A BILLION-DOLLAR INDUSTRY.

00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:17,310
Herjavec: BRIAN, IT'S BRILLIANT.
IT'S SUCH A GREAT IDEA.

00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,278
YOU WENT OUT
AND CREATED A COMPETITION

00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,581
TO CREATE THE DEMAND FOR IT.
IT'S FANTASTIC.

00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,549
TELL ME -- HOW DO YOU SELL
THE PRODUCT TODAY?

00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,518
SO, ABOUT 90%
WOULD BE ONLINE.

00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,320
WE HAVE TWO RETAIL STORES
OURSELVES,

00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,956
AND WE NOW HAVE THREE
LICENSED STORES, AND WE'RE --

00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:32,592
SO, NOW THE GOAL IS,
IF YOU'RE GONNA BE A
BILLION-DOLLAR COMPANY,

00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:35,394
YOU HAVE TO EXPAND REGIONALLY
AND, REALLY, GLOBALLY.

00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,864
JAPAN IS DEFINITELY
A BIG MARKET FOR US NOW.

00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:39,232
AUSTRALIA'S
GETTING INTO IT.

00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:41,167
I FEEL LIKE I AM THE LID
ON OUR GROWTH.

00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:44,170
I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT OUR HIRING PROCESS

00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,038
KEEPS THE BAD PEOPLE OUT

00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:47,707
AND I ONLY BRING IN PEOPLE

00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:50,142
THAT HAVE A TRUE PASSION
FOR WHAT WE'RE DOING.

00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,044
O'Leary: ALL RIGHT.

00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,946
SO, BRIAN,
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU AN OFFER.

00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:56,048
I'M GONNA STRUCTURE IT
IN A WAY THAT --

00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,351
HE JUST SAID HE WANTS TO KEEP
THE BAD PEOPLE OUT.

00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,119
[ LAUGHS ]
THAT'S WHY
I'M A GOOD PEOPLE.

00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:03,289
IN MY VIEW, THE TRANSIENT NATURE
OF IT HAS ME A LITTLE NERVOUS.

00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:06,092
BUT I CAN SEE SOMEONE HERE
WHO'S WORKING HIS TAIL OFF,

00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:07,360
WHICH IS INTERESTING.

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,028
THE DIVERSITY
AND DIVERSIFICATION

00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,730
OF REVENUE STREAMS
IS OF INTEREST TO ME

00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,832
'CAUSE THAT
DIVERSIFIES RISK.

00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:15,067
I'M GONNA LOAN YOU
$650,000.

00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,970
I'M GONNA ASK
FOR 3% EQUITY,

00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,306
BUT IT'LL GIVE YOU
THE FUNDS YOU NEED TO GROW.

00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:22,475
KEVIN, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR THE OFFER,

00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:24,043
BUT I WILL
HAVE TO DECLINE.

00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:28,080
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT WHY
I'M HERE TODAY.

00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,983
I'M LOOKING TO GET ONE OF
YOU SHARKS ON MY TEAM

00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:33,019
TO HELP US
WITH THE DAY TO DAY.

00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:34,921
SO, YOU DON'T WANT TO DO ANY
DEBT, IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:38,424
I'VE NEVER GONE OUT AND LOOKED
FOR A LOAN FOR THIS COMPANY.

00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,293
OKAY. I'M OUT.

00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:45,831
SO, WHY IS THE OFFER
SO SMALL?

00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:49,368
BECAUSE IF YOU WANT ONE OF US
TO GET OUT OF BED IN THE MORNING

00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,504
TO COME WORK WITH YOU...
MM-HMM.

00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:54,473
...WHY WOULD WE DO THAT
FOR 5%?

00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:57,577
THE 5% WAS BECAUSE I'M NOT
REALLY LOOKING FOR THE MONEY.

00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,112
I THINK YOU GUYS ARE
THE SMARTEST BUSINESSPEOPLE

00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:01,213
ON THE PLANET.

00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:02,982
YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T
YOU GUYS TELL ME

00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:04,984
WHAT PERCENTAGE MAKES SENSE
FOR YOU

00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:06,953
TO JUMP INTO BED WITH US

00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:10,623
AND GROW THIS INTO
A BILLION-DOLLAR INDUSTRY?

00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:11,691
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
AN OFFER.

00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:14,160
I WANT TO HELP YOU
WITH ALL THE LICENSING.

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,662
I CAN GET YOU
THE MARVELS OF THE WORLD,

00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,698
AND I CAN GET YOU INTO
THE SPENCER'S AND PARTY CITYS,

00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:19,699
IF THAT'S YOUR OBJECTIVE,

00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:22,134
AND THE OTHER
BRAND EXTENSIONS.

00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:25,237
I'LL GIVE YOU $650,000
FOR...

00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:31,577
...20% OF THE LICENSING
THAT I BRING TO YOU.

00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:33,546
Herjavec:
AND NOT THE COMPANY.

00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:35,481
SO, NOT THE COMPANY.
THAT IS NOT
OF YOUR COMPANY.

00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,984
I WILL GO OUT
AND GET YOU THE LICENSES.

00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:42,254
I TAKE 20%.
I DON'T WANT ANY EQUITY.

00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:46,092
ALL RIGHT, BRIAN.
LOOK, YOU'RE THE REAL DEAL, MAN.

00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:49,061
LIKE, YOU ARE PROBABLY
ONE OF THE, IF NOT <i>THE,</i>

00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:51,063

WE'VE EVER HAD HERE,

00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:53,099
AND I THINK YOU NEED
SOME HELP WITH GROWTH.

00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:55,701
HERE'S THE OFFER THAT LORI AND I
WANT TO MAKE YOU.

00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:58,170
WE WANT TO HELP YOU.
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE TWO PEOPLE.

IN THE TRENCHES
TOGETHER.
RIGHT.

00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,742
I THINK YOU GOT TO LICENSE IT.
THAT'S OKAY,

00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:05,878
BUT I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO
GIVE UP 20% TO LICENSE IT.

00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,146
YOU CAN DO THAT
THROUGH THE BUSINESS.

00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,148
YOU CAN WORK OUT
THOSE DEALS --

00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,983
OH, NO. YOU CAN'T.
IT'S NOT THAT EASY.
NOT THAT EASY.

00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,085
WELL, HERE'S THE OFFER.
BRIAN,
ONCE YOU GET BIGGER,

00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:16,088
YOU CAN DO BETTER
LICENSING DEALS THAN TODAY,

00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,257
SO WHY COMMIT
FOR THAT TODAY?

00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:21,027

WE'LL TURN DOWN THE LIGHTS,
WE'LL LET YOU DO A PERFORMANCE

00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,112
SO THAT YOU CAN OPEN UP
TO DALLAS. THAT'S EASY.

00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,714
AND THEN DAYMOND,

SO, YOU HAVE THE SPORTS GUY AND

I'M GONNA SAY ONE THING.

WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
NO, WAIT.
UGH.

00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,432
THE ONE THING THAT YOU SAID WAS,
IT WASN'T ABOUT THE MONEY.

00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:34,500
RIGHT?

00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,035
IT WAS ABOUT
THE EXPERIENCE

00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:39,238
AND IT WAS ABOUT THE GUIDANCE
AND IT WAS ABOUT THE SUPPORT.

00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,706

THEY KEEP ON RESPONDING
BASED OFF THE MONEY.

NO, THAT'S CRAP.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:46,045

00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,503
Jeff: AFTER AIRING,
WE HAD ABOUT 12,000 ORDERS,

00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:26,972
WHICH IS ABOUT 11,000 MORE
THAN WE'VE EVER HAD BEFORE.

00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,941
IN YEAR LEADING UP
TO "SHARK TANK,"

00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:29,942
WE HAD $200,000 IN SALES.

00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:32,478
IN LESS THAN THREE MONTHS
SINCE WE CLOSED OUR DEAL,

00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:35,047
WE HAVE OVER $1.1 MILLION
IN SALES.

00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:36,282
HEY, JEFF, JEN!

00:23:36,282 --> 00:23:38,117
HEY!
HEY!

00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:40,185
Jeff: BARBARA WARNED US OF HUGE
SALES AFTER "SHARK TANK,"

00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:42,154
BUT WE WEREN'T QUITE READY
FOR THE VOLUME.

00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:44,089
WE WOUND UP IN A BIT
OF A BACK-ORDER SITUATION.

00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,324
I'M ACTUALLY HAPPY
IT HAPPENED

00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:47,092
SO THAT WE NEVER HAVE
THIS PROBLEM AGAIN.

00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,161
Corcoran:
THE PROBLEM WITH BACK ORDERS

00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:50,763
IS YOU CAN LOSE A LOT
OF VALUABLE CUSTOMERS.

00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,064
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO WAIT.

00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,532
WE WERE HONEST,
TOLD THEM WHAT WAS HAPPENING,

00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:55,167
AND THE PEOPLE
THAT WAITED THE LONGEST,

00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,369
WE GAVE 50% OFF AND FREE
SHIPPING ON THE NEXT ORDER.

00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:00,973
IT TOOK US TWO MONTHS TO FULFILL
ALL THE ORDERS, BUT WE DID IT.

00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:02,975
AND NOW WE HAVE
A BIGGER BUSINESS.
YEAH.
YEAH.

00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:04,476
CO-PACKERS HERE, THERE,
AND EVERYWHERE.

00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:07,146
NOW WE HAVE CO-PACKERS IN
THE MIDWEST, ON THE WEST COAST.

00:24:07,146 --> 00:24:09,949
WE CAN SELL AS MUCH PIPCORN
AS THE CUSTOMERS WILL HAVE.

00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:12,351
GUYS, I'M JUST SO PROUD
OF EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE.

00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:14,920
THANK YOU.
THAT'S THE BEAUTY
OF "SHARK TANK."

00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,989
YOU NEVER KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE.

00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:19,658
DID I EVER THINK I'D BE
INVESTING IN A POPCORN BUSINESS?

00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:22,227
OF COURSE NOT, BUT HERE I AM
AT PIPCORN MAKING MONEY.

00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,529
WHOA.
THERE IT IS.

00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:26,065
WE STARTED IN A POT
AT A FARMERS' MARKET.

00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:28,067
NEXT STOP...
NATIONWIDE.

00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:31,003
IT'S TRULY AN AMAZING STORY
THAT WE ACTUALLY ARE LIVING,

00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:33,172
AND EVERY DAY, WE'RE JUST
SO HAPPY TO BE DOING IT.

00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:49,955
Narrator:
NEXT UP IS A WAY TO MAKE TRIPS
TO THE BEACH OR POOL WORRY-FREE.

00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:57,096
HELLO, SHARKS.
I'M ROB.

00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:59,098
I'M JONATHAN.
AND I'M AVIN.

00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:01,200
WE'RE THE INVENTORS
OF THE AquaVault.

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,235
WE'RE SEEKING
A $75,000 INVESTMENT

00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:04,737
FOR 12% OF OUR COMPANY.

00:25:04,737 --> 00:25:07,172
IF YOU'RE AT THE BEACH,
THE POOL, OR THE WATER PARK,

00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,941
AND YOU WANT TO GO
FOR A SWIM,

00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:10,943
WHAT DO YOU DO
WITH YOUR VALUABLES?

00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:11,944
WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE.

00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:14,380
ROBERT, DO YOU TUCK THEM
IN YOUR SHOES?

00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,615
LORI, DO YOU ASK
THE SKETCHY GUY NEXT TO YOU

00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,083
TO KEEP AN EYE
ON YOUR STUFF?

00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,986
MR. WONDERFUL,
ARE YOU CONSTANTLY LOOKING BACK

00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:23,088
OVER YOUR SHOULDER
EVERY COUPLE OF MINUTES?

00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:24,490
NOT ANYMORE.

00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,091
Kinas:
INTRODUCING THE AquaVault --

00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:28,927
A SIMPLE AND STYLISH
PORTABLE VAULT

00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:30,162
TO SECURE YOUR VALUABLES

00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:33,065
SO YOU CAN ENJOY THE SUN
WITHOUT GETTING BURNED.

00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:36,035
JUST SET YOUR CODE,
INSERT YOUR VALUABLES,

00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:38,070
CLAMP DOWN
OVER ANY FIXED OBJECT.

00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:41,073
NOW YOU CAN STOP WORRYING
THAT SOMEONE'S SNOOPING AROUND,

00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:43,042
READY TO GRAB
YOUR BELONGINGS.

00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:45,744
JUST LOCK UP
AND GO FOR A WORRY-FREE SWIM.

00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:48,614
Samtani:
SHARKS, WE NEED YOUR HELP
TO TAKE US TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

00:25:48,614 --> 00:25:50,582
WHO WANTS TO LOCK UP
AND SWIM WITH US?

00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:52,251
Herjavec:
I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:53,352
I'M ALWAYS DOING THIS.

00:25:53,352 --> 00:25:54,920
SOMEONE'S ALWAYS GOT TO
STAY BY THE TOWEL.

00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,355
WHAT DO YOU
SELL IT FOR?

00:25:56,355 --> 00:25:59,224
IT RETAILS FOR $39.95,
WHOLESALE FOR $22.95.

00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,093
WE MAKE THEM FOR $10.86.

00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:03,062
WE'VE ONLY DONE ONE ORDER
WITH THE FACTORY.

00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,264
IT WAS A 5,000-UNIT ORDER, WHICH
WAS THE MINIMUM ORDER, SO...

00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:07,699
O'Leary: SO, GUYS, TALK TO ME
ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS MODEL.

00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:09,234
I'VE ACTUALLY SEEN
YOUR COMPETITOR.

00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,736
YOU HAVE?
YES.

00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,137
I'VE BEEN PITCHED
THEIR DEAL.

00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:13,972
SO, TELL US ABOUT
YOUR BUSINESS MODEL.

00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:16,475
SO, RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE
A FEW DIFFERENT MODELS.

00:26:16,475 --> 00:26:19,478
WE'RE TARGETING HOTELS DIRECTLY,
CRUISE SHIPS, THEME PARKS.

00:26:19,478 --> 00:26:21,213
WE'RE ACTUALLY IN A MAJORITY
OF THE HOTELS

00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:22,981
ON SOUTH BEACH RIGHT NOW
ON THE BEACH.

00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:24,149
TELL US THE NUMBERS.

00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:26,251
YEAR TO DATE,
WE'VE DONE $87,000 SALES.

00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,820
THAT JUST STARTED
SIX MONTHS AGO.

00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,122
WE HAVE A CONTRACT FOR ANOTHER
1,000 UNITS BY YEAR END,

00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:32,157
SO WE'RE GONNA BREAK $100,000
WITHIN OUR FIRST YEAR.

00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:35,027
YOU SELL THE HOTEL OR LEASE
THE SPACE FROM THE HOTEL

00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:38,197
FOR THE UNITS AND CHARGE
THE CUSTOMERS ON THEIR BILL?

00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:39,498
HOW DO I GET PAID?
Samtani: KEVIN,

00:26:39,498 --> 00:26:41,066
WHAT WE'RE DOING
IS WE'RE SELLING THE UNIT

00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:43,569
TO THE HOTELS
FOR OUR WHOLESALE PRICE.

00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:45,370
THEY'RE THEN RENTING IT OUT
TO EACH GUEST

00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,572
BETWEEN $5 AND $10 A DAY.

00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:49,975
OKAY. DO YOU GET ANY MONEY
OFF RENTING IT?

00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:50,943
NOT JUST YET. NO.

00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,444
HERE'S MY CHALLENGE.

00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,480
WE DEAL WITH A LOT
OF HOTEL CHAINS.

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,549
THEY ARE
INCREDIBLY FRUGAL.

00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:01,920
WHY NOT GIVE THEM
TO THE HOTELS

00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,490
AND THEN TAKE A SHARE
IN THEIR RECURRING REVENUE?

00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,991
'CAUSE I DO SEE THAT.

00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:08,260
I THINK PEOPLE WOULD PAY $5
TO $10 A DAY.

00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,596
WHY HAVEN'T YOU GONE THAT ROUTE?
WHAT AM I MISSING?

00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:12,397
WE WERE JUST STARTING OUT,
AND AT THE SAME TIME,

00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:14,967
A LOT OF HOTELS ARE
NOT GONNA WANT TO OPEN
UP THEIR BOOKS TO US

00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,802
TO SHOW WHAT KIND OF REVENUE
THAT THEY'VE MADE.

00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,203
THE WAY WE HAVE IT
RIGHT NOW,

00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,838
WE'RE SELLING IT TO THEM
WHOLESALE,

00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:21,006
THEY'RE GETTING
THEIR R.O.I. BACK --

00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,407
YEAH, AND PLUS YOU GET
YOUR CASH BACK RIGHT AWAY.

00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:23,876
ABSOLUTELY.
RIGHT.

00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:24,810
SO, WE HAVE
THREE DIFFERENT MODELS

00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:25,978
WHICH WE'D LIKE
TO REALLY DO.

00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:28,580
THE HOTEL PURCHASES
AT WHOLESALE PRICE.

00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,048
THEY THEN
RENT IT OUT DAILY.

00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:32,017
THE OTHER MODEL WOULD BE
THE GIFT-SHOP MODEL.

00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,652
THE THIRD MODEL
IS THE IDEAL MODEL --

00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,154
HAVE THEM
IN EVERY SINGLE ROOM,

00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,122
ABOVE THE ACTUAL SAFES,
INSIDE THE ROOM,

00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:38,724
SHRINK-WRAPPED,
WITH A POINT-OF-SALE SIGN.

00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:40,926
THAT IS TOUGH.
MAYBE A "TAKE ME
WITH YOU" SIGN.

00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:42,528
THAT'S REALLY HARD.
YEAH, THAT'S TOUGH.

00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:44,663
PEOPLE IN VEGAS AND RESORTS,
THINGS LIKE THAT --

00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,098
BEFORE YOU GO DOWN
TO THE POOL,

00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:48,200
YOU'RE GONNA PUT YOUR STUFF
IN THE SAFE.
I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,968
BUT YOU'RE JUST GONNA
USE THE SAFE THAT'S
ALREADY IN THE HOTEL.

00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:51,403
BUT WE LIVE IN A DAY
AND AGE RIGHT NOW

00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,205
WHERE PEOPLE WANT THEIR
SMARTPHONES WITH THEM.

00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:54,506
I THINK
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,674
YOU KNOW, I...

00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:59,411
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $75,000 FOR 25%.

00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:05,083
WE GREATLY APPRECIATE
THAT OFFER.

00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:09,021
25% IS A LITTLE HIGH
FOR US.

00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,656
YOU HAVE NO OTHER OFFERS.

00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:12,057
IS THERE ANY WAY
THAT WE CAN OPEN UP

00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:13,525
TO SEE IF ANYONE ELSE
WANTS TO PARTICIPATE?

00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,093
Samtani:
THERE ARE THREE OF US.

00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:16,728
YOU KNOW, WE'VE LEFT
OUR CAREERS TO DO THIS.

00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:22,034
GUYS, I MADE YOU AN OFFER.
$75,000 FOR 25%.

00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,036
I DON'T MIND,
I'M NOT TRYING TO BE RUDE,

00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:26,071
TO LISTEN IF THERE
WAS OTHER OFFERS,

00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:28,707
BUT I DON'T WANT TO WAIT
FOR OTHER SHARK TANK TRASH TALK,

00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,743
SO $75,000, 25%.

00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:34,079
I DON'T HEAR ANY OTHER OFFERS
COMING. I HEAR A LOT OF TALK.

00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,581
I WANT TO JUST ASK
ONE MORE QUESTION,

00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:37,549
AND THEN MAYBE
I'LL BE INTERESTED OR NOT.

00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,951
EXACTLY MY POINT.

00:28:38,951 --> 00:28:41,520
GOT TO GET MY INFORMATION.

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,589
IS IT ONLY IN MIAMI
WHERE YOU'RE SELLING,

00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:45,324
OR ARE YOU SELLING ONLINE,
AS WELL?

00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:46,992
WELL, RIGHT NOW,
WE'RE SELLING IT

00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:49,194
WHERE WE GOT THE, YOU KNOW,
HOTELS IN MIAMI.

00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:51,730
WE HAVE HSN.
WE HAVE A FEW CATALOGS.

00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,165
YOU'VE BEEN ON HSN?
CORRECT.

00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:54,499
Greiner:
HOW DID IT DO?
AND HOW DID THAT GO?

00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:56,034
THEY PURCHASED
850 UNITS FROM US,

00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:58,070
AND WE ALSO JUST FILLED
A PURCHASE ORDER

00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,171
FROM TVSN
IN AUSTRALIA.

00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:00,639
YOU GUYS ARE FAMILIAR
WITH THEM, RIGHT?

00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:02,608
HOW DID THE, UM --
DID THEY ALL SELL OUT ON HSN?

00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:04,142
WE SOLD 200 UNITS.

00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:05,544
OH, REALLY.

00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:07,379
John: LORI, HOW WAS
THAT PERFORMANCE?

00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:09,982
GIVE ME THE ADVICE
'CAUSE THIS IS YOUR WORLD.

00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:11,984
WELL, IT WASN'T
A GOOD PERFORMANCE.

00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:13,652
THEY KNOW THAT.

00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:17,656
OKAY, GUYS, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING ONLINE?

00:29:17,656 --> 00:29:20,092
SO, RIGHT NOW, IT'S JUST BEEN
RELENTLESS REACHING OUT

00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,360
TO THE P.R. OUTLETS,
MEDIA,

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,095
YOU KNOW, BLOGGERS,
MAGAZINE ARTICLES.

00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,896
WE WERE FEATURED
ON THE "TODAY" SHOW,

00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:26,398
WHICH DEFINITELY HELPED
TO GET OUR ORDERS UP,

00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:29,301
BUT I'D SAY WE'VE BEEN FOCUSING
MORE ON THE COMMERCIAL END,

00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:30,669
SO IT'S REALLY BEEN
AN 80/20 SPLIT.

00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:32,004
YEAH, BUT IF YOU'RE GETTING
ALL THIS P.R.,

00:29:32,004 --> 00:29:34,139
YOU WOULD THINK THERE WOULD BE
CARRYOVER ONLINE, RIGHT?

00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:35,941
THERE DEFINITELY HAS.
HOW MANY UNITS
HAVE YOU SOLD ONLINE?

00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:36,975
WE'VE SOLD ROUGHLY...

00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:38,110
250.
...250.

00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,811
WHOA.

00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:41,313
WOW. THAT'S LOW.
BUT WAIT, WAIT.

00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:42,748
THIS IS MORE OF A COMMERCIAL
PRODUCT IN OUR EYES.

00:29:42,748 --> 00:29:45,050
IT WAS IN FOUR MONTHS,
RIGHT?
THAT'S LOW, GUYS.

00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:47,519
MAYBE
THERE'S A PROBLEM.

00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:52,057
WE HAVE -- WE HAVE
1,000 OTHER ONLINE VENDORS

00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:53,692
SELLING THE PRODUCT RIGHT NOW,
OTHER THAN OUR WEBSITE.

00:29:53,692 --> 00:29:56,061

00:37:30,148 --> 00:37:32,650
AND MOST SHARING
AND REORDERING THE MOST.

00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:36,187
SO, AGAIN, THE REPEAT-PURCHASE
PERCENTAGE

00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:39,057
FROM ONE COLLECTION
TO ANOTHER IS 14%.

00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:40,492
HOWEVER, I DON'T THINK

00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:42,694
THAT YOU SHOULD LOOK AT IT
IN A VACUUM LIKE THAT.

00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:44,896
AND SO, I DON'T THINK
THAT WITH TWO COLLECTIONS,

00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:46,331
YOU CAN COME
TO THAT CONCLUSION.

00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:48,166
Herjavec:
THAT'S A BIG STATEMENT, RIGHT?

00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:50,635
WELL, I THINK THAT YOU
SHOULD STOP CORRECTING
US ON WHAT WE THINK.

00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:55,073
I MEAN, THIS EARLY,

00:37:55,073 --> 00:37:57,776
THERE SHOULD BE SUCH
A PASSIONATE RESPONSE TO YOU,

00:37:57,776 --> 00:38:01,079
SUCH A PASSIONATE RESPONSE TO
WHATEVER COLLECTION YOU PUT UP,

00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:04,249
PARTICULARLY SINCE
YOU'RE ONLINE, THAT 14% IS LOW.

00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:06,851
RIGHT?
WHETHER IT'S VALUATION

00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:08,787
OR, YOU KNOW,
HOW YOU SEE THE FUTURE,

00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,155
I THINK THERE'S A DISCONNECT,

00:38:10,155 --> 00:38:12,357
AND SO, FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.

00:38:12,357 --> 00:38:14,058
OKAY. I APPRECIATE IT.

00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:18,496
BEAUTIFUL DESIGNS.

00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:21,432
I DON'T SEE IT TODAY
AT THAT VALUE.

00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:22,967
I'M OUT.

00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,336
OKAY. APPRECIATE IT.

00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:28,239
UM...

00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,074
O'Leary: I THINK
YOU MADE A BIG MISTAKE.

00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:31,976
I THINK YOU MADE
THE ASSUMPTION

00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,913
THAT JUST 'CAUSE SOMEONE ELSE
OUTSIDE OF SHARK TANK

00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:38,116
WOULD PAY YOU A RIDICULOUS
MULTIPLE FOR YOUR BUSINESS --

00:38:38,116 --> 00:38:39,284
BEYOND RIDICULOUS --

00:38:39,284 --> 00:38:42,353
THAT YOU COULD BRING THAT
IN HERE AND USE IT AS PROOF

00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:44,455
THAT YOU'RE WORTH $9 MILLION
OR $10 MILLION.

00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:47,158
AN MBA IS NOT A PREREQUISITE
FOR SUCCESS AT ALL.

00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,526
I HAVE ONE, TOO.

00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:49,727
WHO CARES?

00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:51,996
YOU HAVE TO GO MAKE MONEY
FOR INVESTORS.

00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,531
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:57,135
I PERSONALLY THINK IT'S WORTH
ABOUT 1.5 MILLION BUCKS.

00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:01,606
AND IF I WAS GONNA
GIVE YOU $500,000,

00:39:01,606 --> 00:39:03,708
I'D NEED A PREMIUM ON IT.

00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:06,311
I MEAN, I THINK,
MAYBE...50/50.

00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,647
NO, I'M SERIOUS.

00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:11,950

00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:16,754
OKAY.
YOU'RE DEAD TO ME.

00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:18,990
I'M OUT.

00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:23,228
IF I HAD TO TELL YOU SOMETHING
TO LEARN FROM THIS

00:39:23,228 --> 00:39:25,163
THAT I DO THINK
IS IMPORTANT,

00:39:25,163 --> 00:39:27,098
WE GET A LOT OF PEOPLE
IN HERE THAT SAY,

00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:28,933
"I'M FROM SILICON VALLEY,

00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:32,237
SO THEREFORE I'VE RAISED
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS."

00:39:32,237 --> 00:39:34,973
AND THEY'RE SO IN LOVE
WITH RAISING MONEY

00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:39,577
THAT THE BRASS TACKS OF ACTUALLY
SELLING SOMETHING GETS LOST.

00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:42,213
I'M OUT.

DAYMOND IS
THE ONLY ONE LEFT.

00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:48,019
SO, HOW DO YOU THINK
YOUR NEGOTIATION STYLE

00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:49,153
HAS WORKED TODAY?

00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:52,223
UM...

00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:55,927
PROBABLY NOT THAT WELL.

00:39:55,927 --> 00:39:58,529
I HAVE NOTHING
AGAINST STRONG WOMEN.

IF YOU WERE A MALE UP HERE

00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:02,166

THE SAME EXACT WAY.

"OH, THAT'S NEVER
GONNA HAPPEN. OH."

AND CORRECTING US
ALL THE TIME,

'CAUSE WE JUST WANT TO GET
THE INFORMATION.

00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,274
I JUST DON'T THINK
IT WAS THE PROPER WAY.

00:40:09,274 --> 00:40:11,242
ON ONE SIDE, HONESTLY,

00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:15,146
I DON'T KNOW
IF I'VE SEEN BETTER DESIGNS.

00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:17,081
THANK YOU.
SO, UM...

00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,784
DAYMOND,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

Narrator:
FOUR SHARKS ARE OUT.

00:40:36,067 --> 00:40:38,903
DAYMOND IS CATALINA'S
LAST CHANCE

00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:42,607
TO MAKE A DEAL
FOR HER LINGERIE COMPANY NAJA.

00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,042
DAYMOND,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

00:40:50,882 --> 00:40:56,287
YOUR VALUATION AT $10 MILLION --
I-I CAN'T COME CLOSE TO THAT.

00:40:56,287 --> 00:41:00,692
LOOK, WHEN YOU SAT DOWN
WITH THE V.C.s IN THE VALLEY,

00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:02,060
YOU HAD TO DO
SOME SORT OF PROJECTION.

00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,494
MM-HMM.
RIGHT?

00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:05,830
SO, ONE-YEAR, THREE-YEAR
PROJECTIONS IN SALES,

00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:06,998
WHAT DID YOU TELL THEM?

00:41:06,998 --> 00:41:08,433
WHAT ARE MY PROJECTIONS
FOR THIS COMPANY?

00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:09,500
OR DID THEY NOT CARE?

00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,002
AT THAT POINT,
THEY DIDN'T CARE.

00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:13,471
WOW.
THAT'S AMAZING.

00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,974
WHAT DO YOU PROJECT YOUR SALES
TO BE IN TWO YEARS?

00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:18,242
FOURT-- ABOUT $14 MILLION
IN REVENUE A YEAR.

00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:21,646
John: I'M JUST CURIOUS.
AND THEN THE YEAR AFTER?

00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:23,648
BUT WHERE DO YOU GET THAT
PROJECTION FROM? WAIT.

00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,750
I HAVE TO --
I HAVE TO SOBER THIS DOWN.
FROM THE AIR.

00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:29,420
I WONDER WHERE PEOPLE COME UP
WITH THESE REALLY HUGE,

00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,557
WHAT I CONSIDER
SOMEWHAT CRAZY PROJECTIONS.

00:41:32,557 --> 00:41:35,059
AND THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOUR LINE.

00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:38,096
Herjavec: CATALINA,
DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS

00:41:38,096 --> 00:41:41,232
TO GO FROM $140,000
TO $14 MILLION?

00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:43,134
EVEN IN SILICON VALLEY,

00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:46,904
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES
TO GET TO THAT LEVEL?

00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:48,873
ORACLE DIDN'T DO IT
IN THAT RATE.

00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:52,076
MICROSOFT DIDN'T DO IT
AT THAT RATE.

00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:54,946
THERE IS ALREADY MONEY IN THERE,
AND I THINK IT'S STUPID MONEY.

00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:58,950
AND I'M -- I'M MAD
THAT IT WAS VALUED AT THAT.

00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:03,988
BECAUSE I WOULD
HAVE BEEN ALL IN.

00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:06,958
SO, WITH THAT, I'M OUT.

ON THE PANTIES, AND IT SAID,
