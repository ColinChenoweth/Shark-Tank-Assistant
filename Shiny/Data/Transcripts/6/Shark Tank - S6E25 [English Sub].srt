WELCOME TO THE SHARK TANK,

00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:05,205

TO START, GROW, OR SAVE
THEIR BUSINESS.

00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:10,043
I'M GONNA BE HONEST WITH YOU.
OUR SALES SUCK.

00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:11,345
Narrator: IF THE SHARKS HEAR
A GREAT IDEA...

00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:12,346
MMM. IT'S YUMMY.

00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,348
...THEY'LL INVEST
THEIR OWN MONEY...

00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:17,317
I'M GONNA MAKE AN OFFER
OF $150,000 FOR 20%.

00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:18,151

WOW.

HOLD IT, HOLD IT, HOLD IT.

00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:20,387
I MADE A MISTAKE.

00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,189
[ LAUGHS ]

00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,091
...AND FIGHT EACH OTHER
FOR A DEAL.

00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:25,259
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:26,293

I'VE GOT AN OFFER.
LET ME DO IT.

00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,130
LET ME MAKE AN OFFER.

00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,065
NO. I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
A SWEETER DEAL THAN LORI,

00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:34,034
WHO'S BEING
A LITTLE CHEAP TODAY.

00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,002
DON'T BE RUDE.

00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:35,969
Narrator: BUT THE ENTREPRENEURS

00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,304
MUST GET THE FULL AMOUNT

00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:40,307
THEY'RE ASKING FOR, OR THEY'LL
WALK AWAY WITH NOTHING.

00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:41,174
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND.

00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:42,242
YOU'RE DELUSIONAL.

00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:43,110
OH, BOY.

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:43,977
OH, BOY.

WHO ARE THE SHARKS?

00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:52,486
THEY'RE SELF-MADE
BUSINESS EXPERTS WORTH BILLIONS.

KEVIN O'LEARY IS
A SHREWD VENTURE CAPITALIST

00:00:57,024 --> 00:00:58,392
WHO MADE HIS FORTUNE

00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,327
SELLING A CHILDREN'S
EDUCATIONAL COMPANY

00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:03,096
FOR OVER $4 BILLION.

00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:07,000
BARBARA CORCORAN WENT
FROM WAITING TABLES IN MANHATTAN

00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:51,011
WITH A SWEET WAY
TO CLEAN UP MESSY KIDS.

00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,122
HI.
I'M DANIELLE STANGLER.

00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,457
AND HI.
I'M JULIA ROSSI.

00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,059
AND WE ARE
FROM CASTLE ROCK, COLORADO,

00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,327
AND WE ARE THE CREATORS
OF NeatCheeks.

00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:10,063
WE ARE SEEKING $150,000

00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:13,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 20% EQUITY
IN OUR COMPANY.

00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:18,305
KIDS ARE GONNA GET MESSY,

00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:22,142
BUT THE CLEANUP PROCESS
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE.

00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:26,046
UNTIL NOW, PARENTS HAVE BEEN
USING TYPICAL WIPES

00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:28,081
TO CLEAN THEIR KIDS'
FACES AND HANDS,

00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,450
AND THEIR KIDS
ARE PUTTING UP A FIGHT.

00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:35,222
THIS IS WHAT A TYPICAL
CLEANUP BATTLE LOOKS LIKE.

00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:37,124
<i>[ SQUEALING, CRYING ]</i>

00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:38,358

KEVIN'S NEVER GONNA CHANGE.

00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:46,466
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:49,236
WITH NeatCheeks, CLEANUP
IS EASY AND TANTRUM-FREE.

00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:52,406
OUR WIPES ARE PLUSH,
MOISTURIZING, AND MILDLY SWEET.

00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:54,975
THEY'RE PREFERRED
BY MOMS AND KIDS

00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:56,276
BECAUSE THEY'RE GENTLE
ON SENSITIVE SKIN,

00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,178
ALL-NATURAL, EFFECTIVE,

00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,181
AND BEST OF ALL, THEY HAVE
A SWEET, PLEASANT FLAVOR.

00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,250
THAT'S RIGHT -- FLAVOR!
FLAVOR!

00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,453
LOOK HOW HAPPY NeatCheeks MAKES
KIDS DURING MEALTIME CLEANUP.

00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:09,489
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,425
Cuban:
YOU GOT TO FEED THAT KID.

00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:14,027
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,064
WE SWEETEN OUR WIPES
WITH STEVIA,

00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:19,332
WHICH IS
A NATURAL PLANT EXTRACT.

00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:21,134
IT'S NOT SUGAR,

00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:24,304
SO THERE'S NO STICKY RESIDUE
LEFT ON THEIR SKIN.

00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:26,139
INSTEAD,
WHAT THEY CAN EXPECT

00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,341
IS A PLEASANT, SWEET FLAVOR
ON THEIR LIPS

00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:32,179
AND A HUGE SMILE ON THEIR FACE
WITH EVERY WIPE.

00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:36,116
LET'S LET KIDS EVERYWHERE GET
MESSY WITHOUT FEAR OF CLEANUP.

00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:38,251
WHY DON'T ALL OF YOU SHARKS
GET READY TO...

00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,153
WIPE ON A SMILE WITH US?
WIPE ON A SMILE WITH US.

00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,389
WE WANT YOU TO EXPERIENCE
THE NeatCheeks DIFFERENCE.

00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,057
WE HAVE SAMPLES
FOR YOU TO TRY.

00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,395
NOW,
AS YOU OPEN YOUR PACK,

00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,430
IT IS COMPLETELY NORMAL
TO SMELL IT FIRST.

00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,199
WE ARE CONDITIONED
TO DO THAT

00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,367
'CAUSE MOST WIPES ARE
FRAGRANCED, VERSUS FLAVOR.

00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:57,170
BUT WHAT YOU CAN ANTICIPATE
WITH OUR WIPES

00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,005
IS A PLEASANT,
SWEET FLAVOR.

00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,273
MMM. IT'S YUMMY.

00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,975
HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH IT?

00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:04,077
SO, I WAS AT A RESTAURANT
WITH MY FAMILY.

00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,345
I DIDN'T HAVE
MY TYPICAL WIPES,

00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,981
AND MY 18-MONTH-OLD
WAS COVERED IN MAC AND CHEESE.

00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,383
WE WERE IN A QUIET RESTAURANT,
SO I KNEW IF I WIPED HER FACE,

00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,018
SHE WOULD FUSS,

00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:15,322
SO I ASKED MY HUSBAND
TO DIP HIS NAPKIN IN HIS WATER,

00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:18,391
AND I BEGAN TO WIPE HER FACE,
AND SHE REACTED DIFFERENTLY.

00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:21,228
SHE STARTED SAYING,
"NUMMY. MORE,"

00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:23,396
BECAUSE IT WASN'T WATER
IN MY HUSBAND'S CUP --
IT WAS LEMONADE.

00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:25,999
SO THAT'S WHEN THE IDEA OF
A FLAVORED FACE WIPE WAS BORN.

00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,000
O'Leary: THAT'S FANTASTIC.

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,401
HAVE YOU SOLD
ANY OF THESE?

00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,403
YEAH, SO, WE ARE
CURRENTLY APPROACHING

00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:33,073
ALMOST 40
RETAIL LOCATIONS.

00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:34,407
TWO OF THOSE LOCATIONS
ARE WALGREENS,

00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:37,110
IN WHICH WE HAD
A 90-DAY TEST.

00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,179
HOW DID IT DO
ON THE TEST?

00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:42,149
WE ACTUALLY HAD A RAPID REORDER
WITHIN 30 DAYS.

00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:44,084
OUR GOAL
BY THE END OF THIS YEAR

00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:46,419
IS TO ROLL OUT REGIONALLY
WITH WALGREENS.

00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:49,356
ALL RIGHT, SO, TELL US --
WHAT'S YOUR MARGINS, ET CETERA?

00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:50,490
SO, WE MAKE IT
FOR 72 CENTS.

00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,459
AND WHAT DO THEY
SELL IT FOR?

00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,060
$3.99.

00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,162
THAT'S PRICY.

00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:56,463
W--WHAT -- THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A LOT FOR A WIPE.

00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,999
WHAT IS THE COST
OF REGULAR WIPES?

00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,467
THEY CAN GO AS LOW
AS $1.99.

00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,334
OUCH.

00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:05,238
IT SEEMS TO ME, THOUGH,

00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,207
THAT YOU COULD PROBABLY
GET THIS PRICE DOWN.

00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:08,275
ABSOLUTELY.

00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:10,310
THIS IS BASED ON
LOW-VOLUME PRODUCTION,

00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,112
SO WE'RE LOOKING TO BRING
THE PRICE DOWN

00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:14,281
AT THE LARGER VOLUME...

00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:16,116
TO WHAT?
...TO 53 CENTS.

00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:19,019
THAT STILL DOESN'T LET YOU
MATCH AN EXISTING WIPE.

00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:20,187
WE ARE
A PREMIUM-PRICE PRODUCT,

00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:22,289
BUT WE ARE NOT THE MOST
EXPENSIVE PRODUCT ON THE MARKET.

00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:26,159
WE HAVE A UNIQUE
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.

00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:30,363
IN THIS PACKAGE, AS A PARENT,
YOU GET 12 HAPPY EXPERIENCES...

00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,232
JUST LIKE
AN ICE-CREAM CONE.

00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:34,067
...WHEN YOU WIPE
THEIR FACE.

00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,136
YOU KNOW, THIS TRULY
SOLVES A PROBLEM.

00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:38,004
Stangler:
AND WE <i>ARE</i> THE MARKET.

00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,307
WE HAVE A TOTAL
OF SIX KIDS COMBINED,

00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:43,243
SO THROUGH THIS PROCESS,
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP,

00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:44,377
FINE-TUNE, AND MAKE SURE

00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,112
THAT WE'RE BRINGING
THE BEST PRODUCT TO THE MARKET.

00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:47,380
SO, WHAT ARE SALES
THIS YEAR?

00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,184
THIS YEAR,
WE ARE AT $4,000 IN SALES.

00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,419
$4,000?!

00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:56,456
HOW MUCH ARE YOU GONNA SELL
THIS YEAR, YOU THINK?

00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:59,392
YEAH, SO, WE'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT
$90,000 TO $100,000 IN REVENUE,

00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,261
BASED ON LAUNCHING TO
THE LARGEST TRADE SHOW INDUSTRY

00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:02,295
IN SEPTEMBER.

00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:05,165
WHEN YOU GO TO THAT SHOW
AND EVERYBODY SEES

00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:08,001
THE STEVIA-INFUSED
NeatCheeks...

00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,035
YES.

00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,071
...INCLUDING
SOME OF YOUR COMPETITORS,

00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:12,172
WHO ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER
THAN YOU,

00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:13,273
THAT HAVE COST ADVANTAGE
ON SCALE...

00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:15,108
YEAH, SURE.

00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,377
...WHAT STOPS THEM FROM
PUTTING STEVIA IN THEIR WIPE?

00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,312
SO, WE HAVE A PENDING PATENT
ON OUR PRODUCT.

00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,147
LOOK, I THINK
IT'S A VERY INTERESTING IDEA.

00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,250
I LOVE IDEAS THAT ARE BORN
OUT OF NECESSITY.

00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,118
THAT'S FANTASTIC.
YEAH. THANK YOU.

00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,387
NOW, THE PROBLEM I SEE
AS AN INVESTOR

00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,022
IS YOU HAVE A GREAT IDEA,

00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:30,490
BUT YOU ARE COCKROACHES
IN THE FACE-WIPE BUSINESS.

00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,325
YOU'RE GOING TO GO
TO A TRADE SHOW

00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,194
AND EXPOSE THIS
TO EVERY COMPETITOR,

00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:35,362
AND IF IT TAKES OFF,

00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:38,164
THE ONLY THING THAT HOLDS THEM
BACK FROM CRUSHING YOU

00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:40,200
LIKE THE COCKROACHES YOU ARE
IS THE PATENT.

00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,203
SO, TO ME, HAD YOU COME HERE
WITH A PATENT,

00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:45,205
I WOULD HAVE LOOKED AT IT
AND SAID, "ALL RIGHT,

00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:46,439
I'M GONNA HELP
THESE TWO LADIES,"

00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,074
BUT I CAN'T DO THAT

00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:51,011
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
THE OUTCOME OF THE PATENT.

00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:52,178
I'M OUT.

00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:56,149
YOU GUYS, IT'S YOUR DREAM,
AND I GET THAT, RIGHT?

00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,350
FOR ME,
IT'S ABOUT MAKING MONEY.

00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,319
THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES
TO HELP YOU TRANSITION

00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:02,122
FROM WHERE YOU ARE
TO A REAL COMPANY --

00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:04,057
THAT'S A LOT OF TIME.

00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,392
YOU'RE JUST TOO EARLY.
I'M OUT.

00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:11,231
JULIA, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH THE $150,000?

00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,433
YEAH, SO, THE $150,000
WILL ALLOW US

00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,402
TO GO FULL TIME
IN THE BUSINESS.

00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:18,104
WE STILL HAVE HOUSEHOLDS
TO MAINTAIN,

00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,041
AND SO WE'RE GONNA TAKE
A SMALL PORTION

00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,410
TO PAY OURSELVES SOMETHING
IN ORDER FOR US --

00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,111
HOW MUCH IS "SOMETHING"?

00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:25,979
$50,000.

00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,147
EACH?
TOTAL, OR --

00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:28,381
EACH. YEP, EACH.

00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:33,153
SO YOU KNOW, I HATE YOUR ANSWER
TO WHY YOU NEED THE MONEY.

00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,288
WHEN YOU START A BUSINESS,
YOU DON'T PAY YOURSELF.

00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,123
YOU PAY THE BUSINESS FIRST.
CORRECT.

00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,458
THE BUSINESS IS
A LIVING, BREATHING THING.

00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,093
MM-HMM.

00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:43,196
IT GETS EVERY PIECE OF FOOD,
EVERY DROP OF WATER.

00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:45,231
CORRECT.
YEAH.

00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:48,168
<i>IT</i> NEEDS TO SURVIVE
BEFORE <i>YOU</i> SURVIVE.

00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:49,369
YEAH.

00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:50,337
I'M OUT.

00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,976
I TOTALLY APPRECIATE THAT,
AND THE THING IS,

00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,410
WE HAVE BEEN DOING THIS
FOR FOUR YEARS.

00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,981
WE HAVE SUPPORTIVE FAMILIES
THAT ALLOW IT TO PUSH FORWARD.

00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:04,351
SO I'M TO THE POINT NOW THAT I
GET A JOB WITH ANOTHER COMPANY.

00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,353
I'M GONNA SUGGEST TO YOU
THAT YOU DO THAT,

00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:08,254
AND I'M GONNA TELL YOU WHY.

00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:13,193
I REMEMBER WHEN I HAD ALMOST
600 SALESPEOPLE WORKING FOR ME.

00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:16,463
I WAS A BIG BOSS,
THE BIG SHOT IN MY TOWN.

00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:19,099
BY ANYONE'S STANDARD,
I WAS A SUCCESS,

00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,967
BUT I KNEW
I WAS GOING BANKRUPT.

00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,202
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I DID?

00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:24,404
I WENT OUT
AND TOOK A FULL-TIME JOB

00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:26,373
WHILE I WORKED
MY BUSINESS.

00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:29,142
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH STEPPING BACK

00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:30,243
BEFORE YOU GO FORWARD.
RIGHT.

00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,245
Herjavec: BUT, BARBARA,
WHAT ABOUT THEIR FAMILY?

00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:33,380
YOU COULD FIGURE IT OUT.

00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,448
WOMEN IN AMERICA
FIGURE IT OUT EVERY DAY.

00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,083
I'M EIGHT MONTHS PREGNANT

00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,152
AND GETTING
FOUR HOURS OF SLEEP AT NIGHT,

00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:41,054
DOING EVERY SINGLE THING
IT TAKES,

00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:43,223
AND IT'S NO JOKE
WHEN WE SAY

00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:46,259
WE BARELY SLEEP,
'CAUSE WE ARE MANAGING BOTH.

00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,260
I BELIEVE YOU.

00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,062
NO, I GET IT,
BUT WHEN I LOOK AT THIS,

00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:50,330
I THINK ONE THING
AND ONE THING ONLY --

00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,999
"WILL THEY GET
THEIR PATENT?"

00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,067
SO I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER

00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:58,104

00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,115
I HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH A LOT
OF THE MAJOR STORES OUT THERE

00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:12,018
THAT I THINK
WOULD CARRY THIS PRODUCT.

00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,420
BUT I'D LIKE TO MOVE FAST.

00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,089
'CAUSE I JUST THOUGHT
OF AN ANGLE ON THIS

00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:17,490
THAT I THINK IT'S MISSING.

00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,392
CAN YOU MAKE
A CHERRY FLAVOR?

00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,061
YEAH.

00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,396
THEN I'M GONNA MAKE AN OFFER

00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,278
IS IT HARD CONTINGENCY
ON THE PATENT?

00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,415
ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NO CONCERN THAT
WE'RE GONNA GET IT APPROVED,

00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:16,349

WE DID OUR DEAL,

00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,169
I CALLED MY FRIENDS AT MARVEL
AND SECURED A LICENSING DEAL

OF MORE THAN 8,000 CHARACTERS.

THESE ARE REALLY EXCELLENT.

MARVEL IS OWNED
BY THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY,

BETWEEN OUR BRANDS IS LIMITLESS.

IT HAS TO BE
A BINK-ENABLED BOOK, RIGHT?

00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,044
SO YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH

00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:14,413
AN ANNOTATION PROCESS
FOR EACH BOOK,

00:25:14,413 --> 00:25:17,449

YOU UPLOAD
YOUR MANUSCRIPT,

00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:29,395
AND THEN YOU DRAG AND DROP
CONTENT --

00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:30,462
SO YOU MAKE THE AUTHOR
DO IT?

00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:33,198
YEAH, THE CONTENT OWNER
DOES THE CURATING.

00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,067

FOR ALL OF THE MAJOR
DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS,

AND THEN, AS A READER,
I CAN GO TO MY FAVORITE CHANNEL.

00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,252
SAY I'M ON
THE OLDEST KINDLE,

AND I CAN FIND
THE BENEATH THE INK EDITION

00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,289
OF THAT BOOK
AND DOWNLOAD THAT.

00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,224
AND WHERE DO YOU GET PAID?

00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,093
THERE'S
THREE REVENUE STREAMS.

00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:02,227
FIRST OF ALL,

00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,063
WE HAVE A LICENSING MODEL
FOR LARGE CORPORATIONS

00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,465
OR INSTITUTIONS THAT WANT TO DO
SEVERAL BENEATH TITLES.

00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:09,334
WE ALSO HAVE
A SUBSCRIPTION MODEL.

00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:10,402
FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE
HYBRID AUTHORS

00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,037
OR SELF-PUBLISHED AUTHORS,

00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:15,140
WE CHARGE $12 A MONTH
FOR THAT SUBSCRIPTION FEE.

00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,410
AND THEN WE HAVE AN EXPORT FEE
THAT'S $199 PER CHANNEL.

00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,180
SO, A TYPICAL BOOK
THAT IS GONNA GET BINKED

00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,981
WOULD COST HOW MUCH
TO THE AUTHOR?

00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:24,316
LESS THAN $1,000.

00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:26,285
WE TAKE A ROYALTY SHARE
ON EACH TITLE SOLD,

00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:29,221
AND THAT MEANS THAT
THE UP-FRONT COST FOR THE AUTHOR

00:26:29,221 --> 00:26:30,355
CAN BE LESS, BECAUSE --

00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:32,991
ALEX, WHO'S PAYING YOU
THAT ROYALTY?

00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:34,193
SO, THAT COMES FROM
THE CONTENT OWNER,

00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:35,427
FROM EITHER THE PUBLISHER
OR THE AUTHOR.

00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,296
O'Leary:
I'VE GOT THREE BOOKS OUT,
SO I'M INTRIGUED.

00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:39,431
LET'S SAY I'M $14.95
ON MY UNBINKED BOOK.

00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,434
AM I STILL $14.95 ON MY BINK?
NO.

00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,303
SO, WE'VE DONE TWO
INDEPENDENT FOCUS-GROUP TESTS.

00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:46,438
WHAT WE ASK IS, "WOULD YOU
PAY MORE FOR THIS CONTENT?"

00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,374
98% OF THE USERS SAID
THEY WOULD PAY 10% TO 20% MORE

00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:51,076
FOR THAT ENHANCED VERSION.

00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:53,078
SO THEY'D PAY ANOTHER $2?
RIGHT.

00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:55,013
Cuban: SO, THEN, LET'S JUST
TALK ABOUT YOUR COMPANY.

00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:56,281
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES
IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS?

00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,217
SO, WE CONSIDER OURSELVES
PRE-REVENUE...
OF COURSE YOU DO.

00:26:58,217 --> 00:27:00,285
...WHICH IS VERY, VERY COMMON
FOR STARTUPS AT THIS STAGE.

00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,353
HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN IN BUSINESS?

00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:03,288
WE'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS
FOR TWO YEARS,

00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,490
SINCE ALEX AND I MET.

00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,425
I BROUGHT THE TEAM TOGETHER
AND RAISED OUR FIRST ROUND

00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:08,127
OF FUNDING THROUGH
A CONVERTIBLE NOTE.

00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,194
HOW MUCH DID YOU RAISE?

00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:10,195
$640,000.

00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:11,430
WOW!

00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,265
O'Leary:
THE REAL DEAL HERE IS

00:27:13,265 --> 00:27:16,034
IF YOU CAN BECOME A BRAND
SUPPORTED BY PUBLISHERS SAYING,

00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:18,337
"IF I'M GONNA PUT IT OUT
ELECTRONICALLY AS AN E-BOOK,

00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:19,438
IT'S GOT TO BE BINK."

00:27:19,438 --> 00:27:21,240
THAT'S THE VISION.
THAT'S THE OPPORTUNITY.

00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,242
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THIS THING'S
GONNA BE WORTH ANYTHING.

00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:24,309
I DISAGREE.
WHY?

00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,179
HYBRID AUTHORS
AND SELF-PUBLISHING AUTHORS

00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:28,247
ARE EXPLODING.

00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:30,315
HOW MANY TITLES
ARE BINKED RIGHT NOW?

00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,284
WE HAVE EIGHT TITLES
THAT ARE BINKED RIGHT NOW.

00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:33,452

00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:35,320
WE WENT AFTER
SPECIFIC KEY MARKETS.

00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,256
FOR YOU TO BE SUCCESSFUL
AT THIS,

00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:39,258
YOU HAVE TO BECOME
UBIQUITOUS.

00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:41,426
YOU NEED
HIGH-PROFILE BOOKS

00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:44,229
FROM MAJOR AUTHORS
THAT WANT TO BE BINKED.

00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:45,330
YES.

00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,432
YOU GET A "HARRY POTTER,"
AS AN EXAMPLE, BINKED,

00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:48,333
YOU'RE DONE.

00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,334
YES.
WE RIDE THAT WAVE.

00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,003
EVERYBODY ELSE
WILL COME TO YOU.
YES.

00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,338
BECAUSE --
HAVE YOU APPROACHED
ANY PEOPLE LIKE --

00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,439
LIKE LARGE PUBLISHERS,
AND --

00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,341
YES, YES, YES.
SO WHERE ARE YOU WITH THAT?

00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:59,411
WE ARE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH
A THRILLER AUTHOR WHO IS BIG.

00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:02,948
LOOK, WHAT WILL
MY INCREMENTAL SALES BE

00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:04,216
TO OFFSET THE COST
OF DOING THAT?

00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:05,317
YES.
THAT'S ALL I CARE ABOUT.

00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:07,119
YOU TELL ME I BINK IT

00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:09,221
AND I GET A 60% LIFT,
30% LIFT, 20% LIFT,

00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:12,224
THEN I CAN MEASURE WHETHER IT'S
WORTH PAYING YOU IN PERPETUITY

00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:13,258
OR ROYALTY.

00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:14,459
I THINK
THE MODEL'S UNPROVEN YET.

00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:18,030
HAVING SAID ALL THAT, GUYS,
I'M NOT THERE ON THIS.

00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,999
YOU ARE AT THE VERY BEGINNING
OF A VERY ROCKY ROAD.

00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:21,433
I'M OUT.

00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,436
WE HAVE DE-RISKED
THIS BUSINESS...

00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:25,404
[ Chuckling ] NO.

00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:27,306
NO, YOU HAVEN'T.

00:28:27,306 --> 00:28:29,107
...FROM THE TEAM TO THE MARKET
TO OUR REFERENCE ACCOUNTS.

00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:30,142
YOU'RE DELUSIONAL.

00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,212
YOU'VE RAISED $600,000.

00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:35,013
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO DRIVE DEMAND.

00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:37,316
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
TO PAY THE MAJOR AUTHORS

00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:40,118
WHAT THEY'RE GONNA WANT TO GET
PAID TO DO THE WORK

00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,054
AND TO CONVERT THEIR VERSIONS
TO BINK.

00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,455
DO YOU LIKE THE TECHNOLOGY
ENOUGH TO HELP US GET THERE?

00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:44,423
NO.

00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,326
I MEAN, I'M SURE
YOU'RE A BRILLIANT PROGRAMMER,

00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:50,362
BUT I THINK YOU'VE TRIED
TO EXTEND TECHNOLOGY

00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:52,030
THAT'S ALREADY THERE.

00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,399
I JUST DON'T SEE IT, GUYS.

00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,269
IT'LL TAKE MORE CASH THAN
I'D EVER BE WILLING TO APPLY.

00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:58,437
I THINK
YOU'VE GOT COMPETITION

00:28:58,437 --> 00:29:00,439
YOU DON'T EVEN REALIZE
THAT YOU HAVE.

00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:02,307
AND FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.

00:29:04,176 --> 00:29:06,278
Greiner:
I THINK IT SOUNDS REALLY SMART,

00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:08,947
AND A MUCH BETTER
READING EXPERIENCE,

00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,282
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME
VERY COMPLICATED

00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:12,417
FOR YOU TO BE ABLE
TO GET THAT OUT THERE

00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,052
AND MAKE MONEY FROM IT.

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,123
I CAN'T INVEST. I'M SORRY.
I'M OUT.

00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:21,126
I DON'T THINK YOU'LL FIND
A MORE TENACIOUS

00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:22,995
AND DRIVEN GROUP OF PEOPLE.
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.

00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:25,297
Corcoran:
I HAPPEN TO SEE THE MERIT IN IT.

00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:28,100
I HAVE A VERY GOOD-SELLING BOOK
FOR 12 YEARS NOW.

00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,203
I COULD PICTURE A MILLION SPOTS
WHERE I COULD HAVE A BINK

00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:33,272
AND REALLY ENRICH
THE EXPERIENCE.

00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:36,308
BUT THAT'S NOT GONNA MAKE YOU
A LOT OF MONEY.

00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:39,344
I JUST DON'T HAVE THE FAITH
THAT THIS BUSINESS WILL WORK.

00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:40,245
I'M OUT.

00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:43,282
ALL RIGHT, WHO'S LEFT?

00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:44,249
IT'S ME.

00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:45,417
UH, ALEX,
I THINK IT'S, UH,

00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:47,286
A BRILLIANT IDEA.

00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:49,054
UM...I REALLY DO.

00:29:49,054 --> 00:29:53,458
BUT, YOU KNOW, FOR ME,
IT SEEMS SO SELF-EVIDENT --

00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,361
IT HAS TO DRIVE
MORE BOOK SALES.

00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:58,297
BUT YOU DON'T SEEM TO
SHARE IN THAT WITH ME.

00:29:58,297 --> 00:29:59,398
NO. WE ABSOLUTELY
SHARE THAT.

00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:01,066
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED
THE MONEY FOR.

00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:02,401
WE NEED THE MONEY
FOR OUR GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY

00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:04,403
SO THAT WE CAN TEST
THAT HYPOTHESIS.

00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:08,240
RIGHT, BUT YOU'RE SEARCHING
FOR A REVENUE MODEL. YOU ARE.

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,308
IT'S JUST TOO EARLY.

00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,376
I JUST CAN'T GET BEHIND IT
RIGHT NOW.

00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:13,412
AND FRANKLY, $350,000,

00:30:13,412 --> 00:30:18,250
FOR THE WAY I SEE YOU HAVING TO
BUY YOUR WAY INTO THE MARKET --

00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,319
IT'S JUST A DROP IN THE BUCKET.

00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,188
IT WOULD TAKE MILLIONS.

00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:25,390
AND I'D BE INTERESTED
IF YOU HAD A VERY CLEAR PATH,

00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,992
BUT YOU DON'T.

00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:27,426
I'M OUT.

00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:31,196
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
Milewski: THANK YOU.

00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:32,030
APPRECIATE IT.

00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:32,397
Greiner: GOOD LUCK.

00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:38,337
Milewski: THIS IS ABSOLUTELY
THE WAY OF THE FUTURE.

00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,372
WE CAN SEE IT AS CLEARLY
AS WE SAW THE SHARKS TODAY.

00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:42,074
AND EVEN THOUGH
THEY MISSED OUT,

00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:43,375
WE'RE STILL HEADING
IN THAT DIRECTION.

00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:45,410
WE'RE GONNA GET THERE.
WE'RE GONNA BINK MORE BOOKS.

00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,145
WE'RE GONNA WORK WITH
MORE AUTHORS.

00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:49,014
AND WE ARE GOING TO BE
THE GO-TO STANDARD

00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,215
FOR ENHANCED BOOKS
IN THE FUTURE.

00:31:00,492 --> 00:31:02,561
MY NAME IS MONT HANDLEY, AND I'M
FROM PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA.

00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:06,298
MY PRODUCT IS PittMoss, AND IT'S
A REPLACEMENT FOR PEAT MOSS.

00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:08,367
PEAT MOSS
IS A NATURAL SOIL ADDITIVE

00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:09,601
THAT'S COMMONLY USED
BY HOME GARDENERS,

00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:11,470
COMMERCIAL GREENHOUSES,
AND NURSERIES.

00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:14,206
IT HELPS PLANTS RETAIN WATER
AND GROW FASTER.

00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,274
THE PROBLEM
WITH HARVESTING PEAT MOSS --

00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:18,510
IT HAS TERRIBLE
ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES.

00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,479
AND AS PEATLANDS AROUND
THE WORLD ARE BEING DRAINED,

00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:23,382
THEY RELEASE
AS MUCH AS 1 BILLION TONS

00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,650
OF CARBON POLLUTION
INTO THE ATMOSPHERE EVERY YEAR.

00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:29,454
THAT IS NEARLY 8%
OF ALL ANNUAL CARBON POLLUTION.

00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:32,391
IF WE DON'T START
CONSERVING PEATLANDS NOW,

00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:34,226
OUR PLANET COULD BE
IN BIG TROUBLE.

00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,394
BUT MY PRODUCT, PittMoss,

00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:37,596
OFFERS A GREEN AND SUSTAINABLE
ALTERNATIVE TO PEAT MOSS.

00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:39,364
IT'S MADE
FROM RECYCLED NEWSPAPER,

00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:41,466
AND IT WOULD OTHERWISE END UP
IN A LANDFILL.

00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:43,435
THIS BUSINESS
MEANS EVERYTHING TO ME.

00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:45,470
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT
THE FINANCIAL SUCCESS.

00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,472
IT'S ABOUT DOING SOMETHING
COLLECTIVELY GOOD

00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:49,374
FOR THE PLANET.

00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:51,343
IT'S ABOUT BUILDING A BUSINESS
AND REALIZING

00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:53,311
YOU CAN STILL ACHIEVE
THE AMERICAN DREAM.

00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:56,381
I HOPE THE SHARKS SEE
THAT WHAT I'M DOING IS IMPORTANT

00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,216
AND ALLOW ME
TO KEEP MY DREAM ALIVE.

00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:12,497
HELLO, SHARKS.

00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:15,434

FROM PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA.

00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:16,268

[ GREINER CHUCKLES ]

00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:18,637
I'M THE INVENTOR OF PittMoss,

00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:21,206
AND I'M HERE TO OFFER YOU
25% EQUITY

00:32:21,206 --> 00:32:24,409
FOR A $600,000 INVESTMENT
IN MY MANUFACTURING COMPANY.

00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:27,412
PittMoss IS A SOIL ALTERNATIVE
THAT'S GOING TO GREEN UP

00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:29,614
THE LANDSCAPING
AND GARDENING INDUSTRY.

00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,417
SHARKS, WALK THROUGH
ANY RETAIL GARDEN CENTER,

00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:34,653
HOME-IMPROVEMENT STORE,
OR EVEN YOUR LOCAL SUPERMARKET,

00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:37,355
AND YOU'RE LIKELY TO SEE
A DISPLAY OF PLANTS.

00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:39,558
I KNOW
THOSE PLANTS HOLD AS MUCH

00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:42,260
AS 85% PEAT MOSS
IN THOSE CONTAINERS.

00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,630
PEAT MOSS IS STRIPPED AWAY FROM
DRAINED AND DEGRADED PEAT BOGS

00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,299
THAT WE ARE DEPLETING,

00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,301
AND THAT WOULD AID US
IN OUR FIGHT

00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:52,537
AGAINST GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE
IF WE SIMPLY LEFT THEM ALONE.

00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:54,372
AND THAT'S WHY
I INVENTED PittMoss.

00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:57,275
PittMoss IS MADE
FROM RECYCLED PAPER

00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:59,511
AND A SECRET FORMULA
OF ORGANIC ADDITIVES,

00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:02,380
AND IT HAS PROVEN ITSELF
TO BE SUPERIOR TO PEAT MOSS

00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,316
IN EVERY CONCEIVABLE WAY.

00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:07,452
WE EVEN GREW THESE PLANTS HERE
IN PittMoss

00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:09,554
AND SHIPPED THEM ALL THE WAY
FROM PITTSBURGH FOR YOU.

00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:11,256
SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY, SHARKS?

00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:13,391
WHO WANTS TO BE
A DIRTY CAPITALIST

00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:16,361
AND INVEST IN MY SOIL
ALTERNATIVE CALLED PittMoss?

00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:17,529
CAN WE SEE IT?
I HAVE A QUESTION.

00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:18,463
ABSOLUTELY.

00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:19,698
CAN WE --
JUST A SAMPLE?

00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:22,434
HOW DOES THE PRICE COMPARE
TO DIRT -- REGULAR OLD DIRT?

00:33:22,434 --> 00:33:23,468
WELL, WE'RE NOT COMPARING
TO DIRT.

00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:24,603
AND HOW DOES IT COMPARE
TO PEAT MOSS?

00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:27,272
PEAT MOSS IS
A PREMIUM PRODUCT

00:33:27,272 --> 00:33:28,640
THAT GREENHOUSES
AND NURSERIES USE,

00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,309
AND IT SELLS
ON A CUBIC-FOOT BASIS.

00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:34,212
PEAT MOSS RANGES
ABOUT $2.50.

00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:35,480
AND THIS RANGES
HOW MUCH?

00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,551
WE MAKE 60% PROFIT
AT $2 A CUBIC FOOT.

00:33:39,551 --> 00:33:40,585
SO IT'S 20% CHEAPER?

00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:42,521
IT'S ABOUT
15% TO 25% CHEAPER.

00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,456
AND IT'S GREEN.
AND IT'S GREEN.

00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:48,560
WE ACTUALLY CAN SAVE GROWERS 15%
ON THEIR OPERATING COSTS,

00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,428
BECAUSE IT'S SUPERIOR
TO PEAT MOSS.

00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:53,298
THE NATURAL PRODUCT
CARRIES IN PATHOGENS --

00:33:53,298 --> 00:33:55,500
WEED SEEDS, MOLD SPORES,
INSECT LARVAE.

00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,270
OURS IS COMPLETELY UNIFORM,
STERILE PRODUCT.

00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,304
AND ONE LAST THING --

00:33:59,304 --> 00:34:00,472
OUR GROWERS
WHO ARE USING IT RIGHT NOW

00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:03,241
REPORT THAT
IT RETAINS MOISTURE LONGER.

00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:04,643
IT'S A VERY GOOD THING
FOR THE PLANET.

00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:08,213
IF THEY WERE WATERING EVERY DAY
WITH REGULAR PEAT MOSS,

00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:10,181
THEY'RE WATERING EVERY OTHER DAY
NOW WITH PittMoss.

00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:12,450
TELL US ABOUT YOUR SALES.

00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:13,618
OUR SALES.
YEAH.

00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:16,388
I'M GONNA BE HONEST WITH YOU.
OUR SALES SUCK.

00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:17,422
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:18,590
THAT'S HONEST.

00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:21,393
WE BUILT THIS PLANT IN
NORTH HUNTINGTON, PENNSYLVANIA,

00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,328
OUTSIDE OF PITTSBURGH,
LAST SUMMER.

00:34:23,328 --> 00:34:24,429
I QUIT MY JOB.

00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,398
I CASHED OUT MY 401(k)s
TO BUY THIS EQUIPMENT.

00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,534
I COULD NOT FIND INVESTORS
TO HELP ME BUILD MY DREAM,

00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:31,202
SO I DID IT MYSELF.

00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:32,537
I THOUGHT I'D BE
GIVING THE PRODUCT AWAY

00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:34,506
FOR 8 TO 12 MONTHS
BEFORE WE HAD OUR FIRST SALES.

00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:36,408
IT TOOK US TWO MONTHS
TO GET OUR FIRST SALES.

00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:38,176
THAT SOUNDS GOOD SO FAR.

00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:38,610
ABSOLUTELY.

00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:39,644
WHERE'S THE BAD?

00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:41,613
HE HASN'T GIVEN US
THE TOTAL YET.

00:34:41,613 --> 00:34:44,416
THE BAD IS -- OH, $22,000
FOR THE LAST SEVEN MONTHS.

00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:46,685
WHY ONLY $22,000?
WHAT'S HOLDING YOU BACK?

00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:48,453
WHY DIDN'T THE ORDERS
KEEP COMING?

00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:49,588
WE DO HAVE ORDERS.

00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:52,223
WE HAVE $168,000
IN SALES AGREEMENTS RIGHT NOW.

00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:53,658
BUT YOU CAN'T FILL THEM
BECAUSE OF CAPACITY?
WE CANNOT FILL THEM.

00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:55,293
WHY?
CAPACITY. WE --

00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:56,561
HOW MUCH CAN
THE EXISTING PLANT MAKE?

00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:57,596
OH.
ANSWER THAT.

00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,598
THE EXISTING PLANT
CAN MAKE

00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,499
ABOUT 200 TONS A YEAR,
AND WE NEED TO --

00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:03,368
AND HOW MUCH IS THAT
IN REVENUE?

00:35:03,368 --> 00:35:04,569
UM, $60,000.

00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:07,505
YOU KNEW GOING IN

00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:09,641
THAT THE SIZE OF THE FACTORY
YOU WERE BUILDING

00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:13,678
WOULD ONLY PRODUCE $60,000
OF TOP-LINE PRODUCT?

00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:17,582
I ONLY BUILT THE FACTORY
