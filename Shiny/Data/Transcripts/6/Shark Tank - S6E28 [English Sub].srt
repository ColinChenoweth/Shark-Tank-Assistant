Narrator: BUT THE ENTREPRENEURS
MUST GET THE FULL AMOUNT

00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:34,067
THEY'RE ASKING FOR, OR THEY'LL
WALK AWAY WITH NOTHING.

00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:36,003
WE'RE FIGURING IT OUT.
WE'RE REALLY YOUNG.
WE JUST GRADUATED --

00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:38,138
THE "WE'RE REALLY YOUNG"
EXCUSE -- EH, DON'T WORK.

00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,173
HOW DO YOU SCALE IT?

00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:41,975
I'M NOT AT ALL INTERESTED
IN THE MONEY.

00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:43,043

AND OUR BUSINESS
IS CALLED ZOOM.

00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:50,310
THE THREE OF US MET
IN COLLEGE,

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,012
ACTUALLY,
IN OUR FIRST DESIGN CLASS,

00:01:52,012 --> 00:01:53,280
AND IT WAS KIND OF
LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT,

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,982
AND WE'VE BEEN
TOGETHER EVER SINCE.

00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:57,050
AT SCHOOL, WE CAME UP
WITH AN AWESOME BUSINESS IDEA

00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,053
BASED ON HIGH STYLE
AND IMPECCABLE DESIGN.

00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:03,256
PEOPLE THINK YOU HAVE
TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY
TO GET A GOOD DESIGN,

00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:04,358
BUT THAT'S
SO NOT THE CASE.

00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:06,293
WE FIGURED OUT A NEW WAY
TO BRING STYLE TO EVERYONE

00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,328
AND MAKE IT AFFORDABLE
AND ACCESSIBLE.

00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,998
WE GRADUATED A FEW WEEKS AGO
AND MOVED TO PHILLY

00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:12,399
AND HAVE OFFICIALLY STARTED
OUR BUSINESS.

00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,968
EACH OF US TAKES ON
A DIFFERENT ROLE IN THE COMPANY.

I'M IN CHARGE
OF MARKETING AND SALES,

00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,171

AND I TAKE ON
GENERAL OPERATIONS.

00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,311
WE ARE ON BUDGET,

00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,980
WE HAVE WORKED SO HARD
TO GROW THIS COMPANY

00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,282

WE KNOW
WITH A SHARK ON OUR TEAM,

00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,189
WE CAN ZOOM PAST
OUR COMPETITION

00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,324
AND TAKE THIS COMPANY
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:56,276
GUESS WHAT, SHARKS.

00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,078

YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET ZOOMED!

BY MAKING IT ACCESSIBLE
AND AFFORDABLE TO EVERYONE.

00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,333

TO DO JUST THAT.

00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:29,209
LET US WALK YOU
THROUGH OUR ZOOM DESIGN PROCESS

00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,378
FROM START TO FINISH
WITH A RECENT PROJECT.

STEP ONE -- FILL OUT
THE "GET ZOOMED" SURVEY

00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,248
TO START
THE DESIGN PROCESS.

00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:37,017
IT'S QUICK AND PAINLESS.

00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:41,121
STEP TWO -- SCHEDULE YOUR FREE

STEP FOUR -- WORK WITH

THIS IS THE "BEFORE" PHOTO
FROM THIS PROJECT.

00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,313
OUR CLIENTS WANTED
A FULL TRANSFORMATION

00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:09,382
THAT WOULD MAKE THIS SPACE
BRIGHT, MODERN, AND COLORFUL.

00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:12,119
AND LOOK AT THAT --
QUITE A DIFFERENCE.

00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,220
WOW.
Herjavec: WOW.

00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,354
HERE ARE
SOME OTHER ZOOM PROJECTS

00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,323
WITH DIFFERENT BUDGETS
AND STYLES.

00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:20,026
Fraser:
THIS BACHELOR CLEARLY NEEDED
SOME HELP WITH HIS BEDROOM.

00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,294
WHERE IS THAT,
A PRISON SOMEWHERE?

00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,997
NO, I THINK IT LOOKS GOOD.
WHY WOULD YOU RUIN IT?

00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:25,232
[ LAUGHTER ]
OH, WELL JUST WAIT!

00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:26,266
HERE'S THE "AFTER."

00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,969
HE WANTED
AN URBAN-INDUSTRIAL LOOK.

00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:30,137
WHOA!

00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:32,005
WE TRANSFORMED IT
FOR $1,000.

00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,206
WOW.
Corcoran: IMPOSSIBLE.

00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,043
SO THIS NEXT CLIENT STILL HAD
HER COLLEGE FUTON.

00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:39,112
SHE WANTED A GLAMOROUS,
SHABBY-CHIC BEDROOM

00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,248
THAT WOULD MATCH
HER NEW ADULT LIFE.

00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:43,216
WE GAVE THAT TO HER
FOR $1,700.
OH, I LIKE THAT.

00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,317
OH, THAT'S NICE.
YEAH.

00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:48,188
THE INTERIOR DESIGN WORLD
IS SHIFTING ONLINE

00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:50,423
AND WE PLAN TO BE AT
THE FOREFRONT OF THIS MOVEMENT.

00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:54,127
WITH YOUR HELP, WE CAN TAKE THIS
COMPANY TO THE NEXT LEVEL...

00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,062
All: AT ZOOM SPEED!

00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:57,464
O'Leary: TELL US
HOW YOU MAKE MONEY, LADIES.

00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:01,368
SO WE HAVE SO FAR BEEN
IN BUSINESS 14 MONTHS.

00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:03,303
WE STARTED IN COLLEGE
OUR JUNIOR YEAR,

00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,205
AND WE'RE TESTING
THE WATERS.

00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:07,407
TURNS OUT IT DOES WORK,
AND WE'VE GROSSED $186,000.

00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,376
Corcoran: HOW MUCH OF THAT
DID YOU NET?

00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:12,078
DID YOU ACTUALLY GET
ANY MONEY IN YOUR POCKET?

00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:15,148
SO -- WE NET $3,000
AT THE END OF THAT YEAR.

00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,017
HOW DO YOU MAKE MONEY?
DO YOU MAKE MONEY ON THE FEES?

00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:19,085
DO YOU MAKE MONEY
ON SELLING THE FURNITURE?

00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,321
WE'VE STARTED WITH A SERVICE FEE
OF 18% COMMISSION

00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,456
ON THE COST OF GOODS PURCHASED
FOR OUR CLIENT.

00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:26,193
SO I SIGN UP WITH YOU.
WHAT'S MY FEE JUST TO SIGN UP?

00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:30,130
SO TO START, $150 AFTER YOU HAVE
OUR FREE ZOOM CONSULTATION.

00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,399
YOU MEAN YOU TALK TO THEM
BEFORE YOU GET THE $150?

00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,067
YES.
YES.
YES, WE DO.

00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,268
WHY DON'T CHARGE THAT
FOR THE VIDEO CHAT?

00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,137
IT'S 15 MINUTES -- SOMETIMES IT
TAKES LESS THAN THAT --

00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:38,438
AND IT MAKES THE CLIENT FEEL
LIKE WE'RE AN ACTUAL PERSON.

00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,140
Cuban: WELL,
WHAT CAN YOU DO IN 15 MINUTES?

00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,076
I MEAN, YOU SKYPE IN --
Fischel-Bock:
WE HAVE THEIR SURVEYS,

00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,311
SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE QUESTIONS
READY FOR THEM.

00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:45,946
O'Leary:
JUST OUT OF INTEREST,

00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:48,081
IF YOU HAVE
A VIDEO OR SKYPE CALL,

00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:50,350
HOW MANY FOLLOW THROUGH
TO BECOME REAL CLIENTS?

00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,220
UM, I WOULD SAY ABOUT 1 IN 8
FILL OUT OUR SURVEY

00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,122
THAT FOLLOW THROUGH
WITH THE CONSULTATION.
SO WHY DON'T YOU CHARGE THEM

00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:58,058
<i>BEFORE</i> YOU DO THE VIDEO CALL?
Cuban: BECAUSE THEY'RE
NOT GONNA DO IT --

00:05:58,058 --> 00:05:59,226
THAT'S THE ATTRACTION
OF THE INTERNET, YEAH.
'CAUSE THEY DON'T TRUST US YET.

00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:00,994
THEY NEED TO
GET ON THE PHONE.

00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:03,063
HOW MANY HOURS OF TIME
DO THEY EAT UP

00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:05,232
BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY CLOSE OUT
THAT TRANSACTION?

00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:06,433
'CAUSE WHERE
YOU'RE GONNA HIT THE WALL

00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:09,069
ON THIS DEAL RIGHT AWAY IS,
IF THIS WORKS AND IT SCALES,

00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:10,370
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GUYS
ARE GONNA CLONE YOURSELVES.

00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,105
LIKE, HOW'S THAT GONNA WORK?
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.

00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:13,306
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.

00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,308
WE WANT TO PROGRAM THIS PROCESS
SO THAT WE CAN TAKE OUT

00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:17,077
THE MAN-HOURS
THAT WE'RE PUTTING IN RIGHT NOW.

00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:19,045
Herjavec: ARE YOU CHANGING
THE BUSINESS MODEL

00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,948
AWAY FROM MAKING 18%
ON THE FURNITURE?
YES, YES, WE ARE.

00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,950
RIGHT NOW WE MAKE 18%.
WHEN WE START WORKING

00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,353
WITH THESE MANUFACTURERS,
WE'LL BE MAKING 55%.

00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:28,421
YEAH, BUT THEN YOU
HAVE TO TAKE INVENTORY.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. WAIT, WAIT.

00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,357
LET ME GET THIS ONE THING OUT,
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT --
THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM.

HANG ON. HANG ON. YOU DON'T
EVEN KNOW THE PROBLEM YET.
HOW DO YOU SCALE IT?

00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:34,461
WHAT DOES IT MATTER
IF THEY MAKE 18% OR 20%?

AAH!

IT'S IRRELEVANT.

YOU'RE SAYING YOU MAKE MONEY --

00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,217
AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
I UNDERSTAND THIS --

00:06:57,217 --> 00:07:00,020

YOU'RE PLANNING TO MAKE MONEY.

RIGHT NOW.

NO, IT DOESN'T MATTER.
GET BACK TO WHAT DOES MATTER.

00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:20,974
OKAY.
HOW DO YOU SCALE IT?

00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,208
CAN YOU ANSWER THAT QUESTION?
ARE YOU GONNA TALK

00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,243
TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON --

00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:25,378
NO, NO, BECAUSE
WE'RE GONNA TAKE OUT...
NO.

WITH EVERY SINGLE PERSON.

A ROBOT?

00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,218

ON THE COMPUTER.

WHY WOULD THEY NOT MISS
THAT 15-MINUTE CONSULTATION?

WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO,

AND THAT'S
HOW YOU'RE GOING TO SCALE.

ON YOU CREATING
A SOFTWARE APPLICATION

THAT YOU THINK MIGHT HAPPEN
IN...SIX MONTHS,

WHEN YOU'D BE LUCKY
TO DO IT IN SIX YEARS?
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE THINKING.
OH.

00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:53,373
THAT'S NOT EASY.

GET YOU IN THE DOOR.

00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:59,012
$200,000, $1 MILLION --
IT'S PRETTY MUCH IMPOSSIBLE.

00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:02,148
WELL, WE'VE GOTTEN ESTIMATES
FOR $100,000.

00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,216

YEAH, TRUST ME.

00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:06,052
[ IMITATES BUZZER ]
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:08,288
I'M OUT.

00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:13,093
SO AFTER I DO THE $150,

00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:16,262
IS THERE A MINIMUM FURNITURE BUY
THAT I HAVE TO DO WITH YOU?

00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:17,998
IT'S $1,000.

00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,366
SO OUT OF THE PEOPLE

00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:21,101
HOW MANY GO
TO THE FURNITURE BUY?

00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:22,102

WHAT IS THE AVERAGE

00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,409
ABOUT $2,500,
EXACTLY.

00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:31,244
OKAY, SO I DON'T SEE A PROBLEM
WITH THE 15 MINUTES

00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,312

YOU CAN TEACH SOMEBODY ELSE
THAT YOU CAN SUPERVISE.

00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:44,157
OF COURSE. YES.
IN 15 MINUTES,

00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:47,060

THAT PERSON GENERATES $600.
OF WHICH NONE OF THEM
BUY ANYTHING!

00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,298

IT DIDN'T MATTER.

GETTING A CLIENT.

I LIKE THE IDEA,

00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:25,258
BUT YOU CAME IN SAYING
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE THE MONEY

00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:29,295
AND YOU'RE GONNA SPEND IT
ON APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT.

YOU COULD EVER MAKE.
WELL, IF YOU DON'T THINK

00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:32,365

ARE YOU GONNA SPEND IT ON THAT?

WHAT YOUR PLAN IS?

ANOTHER JOB.

AND BOBBY EDWARDS MADE A DEAL

00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,060
WITH LORI GREINER
FOR THEIR TOILET STOOL,

00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,394
SQUATTY POTTY.

00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,462
WE'RE GONNA
TAKE LORI'S OFFER.

00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:51,264
LET'S SEE
WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW.

00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,200
Greiner: I INVITED BOBBY
AND JUDY TO COME WITH ME

00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,234
TO BED BATH &amp; BEYOND
AND CHECK OUT OUR NEW DISPLAY.

00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:57,203
OH, MY GOSH.
LOOK AT THAT.

00:13:57,203 --> 00:14:00,373
WE JUST LAUNCHED
IN EVERY LOCATION NATIONWIDE.

00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:02,108
THAT'S OVER 1,100 STORES.

00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:03,409
IT'S A TOWER
OF SQUATTY.

00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,244
Judy:
THE NIGHT WE AIRED,

00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:08,948
158,000 PEOPLE VISITED
OUR WEBSITE.

00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,317
WITHIN TWO DAYS, WE SOLD
$1 MILLION IN SQUATTY POTTIES.

00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,419
IT'S BEEN THREE MONTHS
SINCE WE AIRED,

00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:17,290
AND OUR TOTAL SALES
ARE $12.3 MILLION.

00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,358
THIS'LL STOP YOU
AS YOU WALK IN THE STORE.

00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,426
Greiner: ONE OF
THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS

00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:23,363
WHEN YOU GET INTO A RETAIL STORE
IS WHERE ARE YOU PLACED.

00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,131
YOU COULD BE
ON THE BOTTOM SHELF.

00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:27,066
WE HAVE AN ENTIRE
FLOOR-TO-CEILING DISPLAY.

00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,202
PEOPLE WOULD DO ANYTHING
TO GET THAT.

00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,203
LONG WAY FROM OUR GARAGE.
THANK YOU.

00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,371
Bobby: IN THE BEGINNING,

00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,006
PEOPLE THOUGHT WE WERE CRAZY
FOR SELLING SUCH A PRODUCT.

00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:36,175
HAVING LORI ON OUR TEAM HAS
REALLY VALIDATED SQUATTY POTTY.

00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,310
Greiner:
LET'S GO CELEBRATE.

00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,011
Judy: LET'S DO.
Bobby: LET'S GO.

00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:41,180
SO, IS THIS WHAT'S GOING TO BE
OUR NEW HOMEPAGE?

00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,983
THIS IS IT.
I LOVE THE CHANGES.

00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,218
Bobby: WE'VE MADE IT OUR MISSION
TO CHANGE THE WAY

00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,419
AMERICA USES THE BATHROOM,

00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:48,287
AND WE'RE HERE TO PROVIDE
PRODUCTS TO HELP THEM DO THAT.

00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,056
AND WE'RE NOT
GONNA QUIT

00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,392
TILL SQUATTY POTTY
IS A HOUSEHOLD NAME.

00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,993
CHEERS!

00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,328
THIS HAS BEEN SUCH
AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE FOR US.

00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:56,429
WE CONTINUE TO BE GRATEFUL

00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:58,431
EVERY DAY
FOR LORI AND "SHARK TANK."

00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:01,100
All: IT'S POTTY TIME!

00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:12,078
Narrator: NEXT UP
IS A CONVENIENT WAY

00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,213
TO MAKE SURE
YOU'RE PROTECTED FROM THE SUN.

00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:28,394
HELLO.
MY NAME IS TONY FAYNE.

00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,062
AND I'M JOSH KAPLAN.

00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,465
Both: TOGETHER,
WE ARE SUNSCREEN MIST.

00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:35,435
SHARKS, WE ARE HERE TODAY
ASKING FOR $400,000

00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:38,204
IN EXCHANGE FOR 15% EQUITY
IN OUR COMPANY.

00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:40,373
WE ALL GO OUT
INTO THE SUN,

00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:43,142
AND WE ALL NEED TO PROTECT
OURSELF WITH SUNSCREEN,

00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:46,045
BUT APPLYING TRADITIONAL
SUNSCREEN IS INCONVENIENT

00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,047
AND IT'S EASY TO FORGET.

00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:49,081
AND IF WE DO APPLY IT,

00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:51,117
WELL, MOST OF US ARE
APPLYING IT INCORRECTLY.

00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,285
BUT DON'T WORRY, SHARKS.

00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,053
WE'VE GOT YOUR COVERED

00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,022
WITH OUR AMAZING
NEW SUNSCREEN-MIST MACHINES.

00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:58,090
THE FIRST-EVER MACHINE
THAT APPLIES

00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,226
THE F.D.A.-RECOMMENDED
AMOUNT OF SUNSCREEN

00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:01,327
IN JUST SECONDS.

00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:04,230
SO NO MORE, "YOU DO MY BACK.
I'LL DO YOUR BACK."

00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,466
NO MORE "UH-OH,
I MISSED A SPOT."

00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,968
AND NO MORE
UNEXPLAINED TAN LINES.

00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,036
SUNSCREEN MIST MACHINES
ARE HERE FOR YOU

00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:11,170
WHEN YOU NEED THEM
THE MOST.

00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,207
WE CURRENTLY OFFER TWO MODELS --
OUR BOOTHS AND STATIONS.

00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:17,043
THE BOOTH IS OPERATED
IN JUST THREE EASY STEPS.

00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:19,212
STEP ONE
IS INSERT PAYMENT.

00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:21,047
NOW, WE ACCEPT MANY
DIFFERENT PAYMENT OPTIONS --

00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:22,315
CASH, CREDIT.

00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:25,184
WE CAN EVEN PROGRAM OUR MACHINES
TO ACCEPT HOTEL ROOM KEYS.

00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:28,087
STEP TWO IS
CHOOSE YOUR LOTION.

00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:31,023
AND STEP THREE IS
CLOSE YOUR EYES

00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:34,427
AND RECEIVE A FULL-BODY MIST
IN JUST SECONDS.

00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:40,099
Herjavec: THAT'S IT?

00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:42,134
AMBER IS NOW PROTECTED
FROM HEAD TO TOE.

00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,237
THERE'S NO NEED TO RUB IN
SUNSCREEN MIST.

00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:45,404
IS YOUR STOMACH COVERED?

00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:48,107
ANDY AND MORGAN
ARE GONNA DEMONSTRATE

00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,309
OUR SUNSCREEN MIST
STATIONS,

00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:53,212
WHICH ARE PERFECT FOR PLACES
SUCH AS THEME PARKS,

00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:57,250
ZOOS, OUTDOOR FESTIVALS,
OR GOLF COURSES.

00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,318
YOU SIMPLY POINT
AND PROTECT.

00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:01,053
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THE CLOTHING --

00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:02,188
SUNSCREEN MIST LOTIONS
ARE MADE

00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,990
WITH A PURIFIED-WATER
AND ALOE-VERA BASE

00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,191
SO THEY WON'T STAIN
OUR CLOTHING.

00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:11,297
SHARKS, THE SUN SHINES
SOMEWHERE 24 HOURS A DAY.

00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:13,132
AND WITH THE RIGHT PARTNER
ON BOARD,

00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,400
YOU CAN HELP US
PROTECT THE WORLD.

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,205
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN USING SUNSCREEN
FOR DECADES.

00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,007
THEY NEVER HAD A PROBLEM
APPLYING IT.

00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:23,342
HAVE YOU JUST SOLVED A PROBLEM
THAT DOESN'T EXIST?

00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,244
I APPRECIATE
THE QUESTION.

00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,346
FOR DECADES,
SKIN CANCER HAS BEEN RISING,

00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:30,049
AND IT IS NOW
THE MOST POPULAR FORM OF CANCER.

00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,183
SO YOU'RE SUGGESTING EVERYBODY'S
PUTTING IT ON INCORRECTLY,

00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:32,285
AND FINALLY A SHOWER

00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:34,186
IN THE MIDDLE OF A BEACH
IS GONNA SOLVE IT?

00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:37,189
IT'S INCREASING POINT-OF-ACCESS
FOR CONSUMERS.

00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:39,992
BUT HER STOMACH DIDN'T GET
ANY OF THE LOTION.

00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,460
Corcoran: THERE'S
NO SHINE ON HER STOMACH.
IT DIDN'T COVER HER ENTIRE BODY.

00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,129
YEAH, IT DIDN'T LOOK
LIKE HER STOMACH HAD GOTTEN IT.

00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:44,430
SO THE MACHINES
ARE ACTUALLY DESIGNED

00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,366
FOR WHERE THEY'RE GOING, SO WE
CAN PROGRAM THE AMOUNT OF TIME,

00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:51,170
AND THEY ALSO CHANGE IN DEPTH
AND IN POWER OF THE SPRAY JETS.

00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,406
DO YOU HAVE ANY OF THESE OUT
THERE IN THE MARKET ANYWHERE?

00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,174
WE ABSOLUTELY DO.
GO AHEAD, TONY.
SURE.

00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:56,175
YEAH, WE HAVE THEM
IN NEW YORK,

00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,344
IN NEW JERSEY, FLORIDA.

00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:01,147
SO YOU HAVE IT ON A BEACH
AS A STAND-ALONE UNIT?

00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:03,382
YEAH, IT'S TERRIFIC.
AND TELL ME --
HOW MUCH DO I PAY?

00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,451
DEPENDING WHERE IT'S PLACED,
IT WILL COST ANYWHERE

00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:06,452
FROM $1 TO $5.

00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,287
IF YOU'RE
AT A LAS VEGAS POOL,

00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,056
YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA PAY
CLOSER TO $5,

00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:11,190
'CAUSE THAT'S
WHAT WATER COSTS.

00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,092
$5 FOR A SUNSCREEN?

00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,027
WHY DON'T I JUST BUY
A BOTTLE OF SUNSCREEN?

00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:17,396
Herjavec: BUT, JOSH,
WALK US THOUGH IT.

00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,999
WHO PAID FOR THE MACHINE
TO GET THERE?

00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:22,301
THEY EITHER -- EXACTLY.
DOES THE HOTEL BUY
THE MACHINE FROM YOU?

00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:23,302
THERE'S
TWO DIFFERENT MODELS

00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,403
THAT WE GO THROUGH
FOR OUR SALES,

00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,205
SO WE HAVE
EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTORS

00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:27,974
THAT ACTUALLY
MAKE A COMMITMENT

00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:29,308
TO BUY A CERTAIN NUMBER
OF MACHINES.

00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,043
AND HOW MUCH DOES
THE MACHINE COST?

00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:34,447
THE STATION,
WE WHOLESALE FOR $6,990,

00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,315
AND RETAIL IT
FOR $14,000.

00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,316
$14,000?
CORRECT.

00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,285
CORRECT.
NO!

00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:42,021
OHH!
YEAH, CORRECT. THE DUAL --
FOR THE STAND-ALONE ONE?

00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:43,422
FOR THE ONE-SPRAY.
THE TWO-SPRAY...
Greiner: THE LITTLE SPRAYER.

00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:45,491
...WE WHOLESALE IT
FOR $8,490,

00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:47,326
AND WE RETAIL IT
FOR $17,000 APPROXIMATELY.

00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,462
AND TWO-SPRAY MEANS IT
JUST GIVES YOU TWO SPRAYS.

00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,097
TWO LOTION CHOICES,
CORRECT.

00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:52,999
YOU MEAN THAT BIG BOOTH
IS $17,000?
OHH.

00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:55,134
NO, THE BOOTH, WE ACTUALLY
WHOLESALE FOR $12,700

00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,336
AND WE RETAIL
FOR $31,2-- $31,500.

00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:58,404
$31,000?!
[ LAUGHS ]

00:18:58,404 --> 00:19:01,140
THAT'S 31,000 SPRAYS
JUST TO GET THE MONEY BACK.

00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,308
WELL,
WE ALSO HAVE DONE

00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,978
$325,000 IN THE LAST THREE
MONTHS WITH THESE MACHINES.

00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,213
SO THAT'S 12 UNITS
AT BASIC--

00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:10,116
I BELIEVE IT WAS
SEVEN DIFFERENT CUSTOMERS.

00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:12,284
SO I CAN BUY A USED HELICOPTER,
OR I CAN BUY THIS.

00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,420
Greiner: WAIT, SAY WHAT --
YOU WERE SAYING

00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,355
THAT YOU WERE IN NEW YORK,
NEW JERSEY, FLORIDA.

00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,024
YES.

00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:20,192
SO WHO WAS PAYING FOR IT
IN THOSE PLACES?

00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:23,029
WELL, RECENTLY, WE HAD
THE GOVERNOR'S BALL IN NEW YORK.

00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:25,464
WE HAD 1,300 CUSTOMERS
IN JUST TWO DAYS.

00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:28,000
1,300 CUSTOMERS
IN TWO DAYS.

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,269
BUT HOW DOES THAT ANSWER
LORI'S QUESTION?

00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,138
THE OWNER OF THAT MACHINE
ACTUALLY TAKES THE MACHINE

00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:33,973
TO DIFFERENT EVENTS
IN THAT AREA,

00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:36,175
SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE EVENTS
THAT THEY HAD THE MACHINE.

00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,276
Cuban: OKAY,
SO YOU'RE BASICALLY BEING

00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:38,444
LIKE THE ATM BUSINESS,
BASICALLY,

00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:43,049
WHERE YOU'RE GONNA LEASE THIS,
SELL THIS TO SOME "ENTREPRENEUR"

00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:45,384
IN SOME LOCATION,
AND THEN IT'S THEIR JOB

00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,253
TO FIND THE LOCATIONS
TO HOST THIS

00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:50,089
AND THEN HOPE THEY GET
ENOUGH CUSTOMERS TO PAY IT BACK.

00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:51,157
THAT'S ONE SIDE
OF THE BUSINESS MODEL.

00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:52,324
THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE BUSINESS MODEL IS

00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:55,161
WE ALSO WILL DEAL DIRECT
WITH LARGE CORPORATIONS.

00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:59,031
TELL ME ONE LARGE COMMERCIAL
OR ENTERPRISE COMPANY --

00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,466
A CRUISE LINE OR HOTEL.
THAT PAYS.
MGM GRAND.

00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:02,201
THAT'S ACTUALLY PAID YOU
FOR IT.

00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,336
SO, MGM GRAND
BOUGHT A BOOTH.

00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:05,371
MGM GRAND IN LAS VEGAS.

00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,306
WE DID A PROOF OF CONCEPT
FOR A FEW YEARS.

00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:08,407
IT WENT WONDERFUL.

00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:10,142
"YEARS"?
"YEARS"?

00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:11,310
WE HAD --
WE HAD TWO YEARS, YEAH.

00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:15,047
WE DID APPROXIMATELY 250 PEOPLE
A DAY ON OUR HIGH END.

00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,383
BUT THEY REDID THEIR --
THEIR ENTIRE POOL-DECK AREA.

00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:20,352
AND SO, WHEN THEY REDID IT,
WE WANTED TO PULL BACK.

00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:23,489
O'Leary: IN TERMS OF GETTING
MASSIVE DISTRIBUTION QUICKLY,

00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:25,491
THERE ARE COMPANIES
THAT ACTUALLY DEVELOP

00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:27,226
BIG VENDING PROGRAMS.

00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,428
THEY PUT IT
INTO A LEASING PROGRAM

00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:32,164
FOR RETAILERS AND POOL OPERATORS
AND OUTDOOR GUYS.

00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,233
AND YOU JUST SIT BACK
AND COLLECT YOUR PIECE,

00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,235
WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY
A ROYALTY LICENSING DEAL.

00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,236
WHY NOT DO THAT?

00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,370
Kaplan:
WE ARE ACTUALLY IN TALKS

00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,272
WITH ONE OF
THE LARGEST COMPANIES

00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:43,275
THAT DOES THAT WITH HOTEL CHAINS
ALL ACROSS THE WORLD.
OKAY.

00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,377
WE WELCOMED THEM IN
WITH OPEN ARMS.

00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:47,279
BUT IF IT'S SOMEBODY ELSE
THAT'S JUST SOMEBODY

00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,116
THAT GRINDS LIKE MYSELF --
I'VE BEEN GRINDING SINCE
I WAS 14 YEARS OLD --

00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:53,419
THAT THINKS THEY CAN GO
OUT THERE AND GET 12 CUSTOMERS

00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,054
ON DAY 1
AND BUY 12 MACHINES,

00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:56,422
THEN WE WOULD LOVE TO
BE ABLE TO SELL TO THEM.

00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,124
I'VE BEEN LISTENING
VERY INTENTLY,

00:20:58,124 --> 00:20:59,325
AND YOU KNOW
HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT?

00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:02,294
IT FEELS SO, SO COMPLICATED,
THIS WHOLE THING.

00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:05,364
THE WHOLE BUSINESS PLAN
FEELS COMPLICATED.

00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,433
THAT MACHINE IS SO LARGE,

00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:10,035
I CAN'T IMAGINE YOU SELLING
ANY MORE, HONESTLY.

00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:13,205
THE SMALLER MACHINE, EVEN THOUGH
IT LOOKS SMALL BY COMPARISON,

00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,340
IS STILL TOO BIG.

00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:19,378
I'M OUT.

00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,280
Herjavec: OKAY, SO, I MEAN,
I HEAR YOU GUYS TALKING

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,382
ABOUT THIS ROUTE
AND FRANCHISES.

00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:26,986
I CAN'T -- I CAN'T FOLLOW
THE BOUNCING BALL.

00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:31,257
I'M OUT.
I APPRECIATE YOU LISTENING.
I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTARY.

00:21:31,257 --> 00:21:33,392
HOPEFULLY, OVER THE REST
OF THE PITCH, YOU RECONSIDER.

00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:34,393
THANK YOU.

00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:37,129
YOU GUYS EXAGGERATE
EVERYTHING.

00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:40,366
YOU TALK ABOUT RETAIL,

00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:41,433
YET YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY RETAIL CUSTOMERS.

00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,102
THERE'S NOBODY AT RETAIL
TO SELL TO, RIGHT?

00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:45,171
WELL, WE'RE WORKING
ON A RESIDENTIAL --

00:21:45,171 --> 00:21:47,273
NO, BUT SEE, THERE YOU GO
AGAIN, RIGHT? BECAUSE --

00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:48,374
WE'VE HAD REQUESTS.

00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:50,009
NO DOUBT YOU HAVE.
[ LAUGHS ]

00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:51,443
Fayne: RIGHT.
THERE IS NO MARKET AT ALL

00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,312
THAT YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW
FOR RETAIL.

00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,981
WE'VE JUST BEEN OPERATING
THIS BUSINESS FOR 3 1/2 MONTHS.

00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,283
THE REASON
WHY WE NEED TO PARTNER --

00:21:57,283 --> 00:22:00,252
YOU HAD IT FOR TWO YEARS
ON PROOF OF CONCEPT.

00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:01,420
THAT WAS NOT FULL TIME.
THAT WAS BEFORE WE KNEW

00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,355
WE WANTED TO COMMIT
OUR CAREERS TO IT.

00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:05,090
SO --
[ LAUGHS, SHUDDERS ]

00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,092
SO YOU GUYS PUT IT ON --
WE PROVED THE CONCEPT --

00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:10,029
I GOT TO ROLL UP
MY PANT LEGS.

00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:11,163
AND IT'S JUST LIKE --
WHAT YOU JUST SAID THERE

00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,433
IS THE PERFECT, PERFECT
EMBODIMENT OF WHO YOU GUYS ARE.

00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:17,369
YOU'VE MADE SOMEBODY PAY YOU
TO DO A PROOF OF CONCEPT

00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:20,172
THAT LASTED TWO YEARS
BEFORE YOU WERE EVEN SURE

00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,441
YOU WERE GOING TO BE
IN THE BUSINESS, RIGHT?

00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:25,144
I -- MARK, I --
MARK, JUST SAY, "I'M OUT."

00:22:25,144 --> 00:22:27,146
I APPRECIATE ALL OF THE INPUT.
"I'M OUT."

00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:28,414
AND THE REASON IS BECAUSE
WE'RE GETTING HUNDREDS

00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:30,115
OF REQUESTS A DAY
TO SELL THE PRODUCT.

00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:31,450
DO YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE
COMING TO YOU A DAY

00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,185
TO BUY THE MACHINE?

00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,054
WE GET HUNDREDS OF LEADS THROUGH
THESE MESSAGE BOARDS A DAY.

00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:36,322
WHICH MESSAGE BOARD
ARE YOU ON?

00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:39,024
WELL, QUITE FRANKLY,
UM, THE --

00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,193
THE INTERNET SEARCHES
HAS JUST BEEN ORGANIC

00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,294
BY POSTING P.R., WEB...

00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,129
AAH! I'M OUT.
...PRESS RELEASES.

00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:46,065
I AM SO OUT! I AM SO OUT!
THANK GOD HE'S OUT!

00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:48,033
I'M SO OUT.
OH, MY GOSH.

00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:51,136
IT IS A SIMPLE QUESTION!
WHAT INTERNET MESSAGE
BOARDS WERE YOU ON?

00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,238
AND THEN YOU START TALKING
ABOUT ORGANIC SEARCHES.

00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:53,439
BECAUSE I WASN'T INVOLVED
IN MESSAGE-BOARDING.

00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:56,008
I THINK MR. CUBAN IS OUT.

00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:59,144
Greiner: THIS, TO ME,
IS ALL ABOUT CONVENIENCE.

00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:00,346
IT'S NOT REALLY
RE-EDUCATING THE PUBLIC.

00:23:00,346 --> 00:23:01,947
LORI, I-I --
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE

00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:04,083
ENOUGH PROOF OF CONCEPT
FOR ME.

00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:06,285
I WISH YOU HAD COME IN
AND HAD SAID,

00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:09,188
"WE HAVE AN INTERCONTINENTAL
HOTEL CHAIN,"

00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:12,324
OR "WE HAVE" SOMETHING
WHERE I KNEW IT WAS WORKING.

00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:14,326
AT THE MOMENT,
BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE

00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:18,063
ENOUGH PROOF OF CONCEPT,
I'M OUT.

00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:23,269
LET'S IMAGINE WE WALK INTO A ZOO
OR A THEME PARK, OKAY?

00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:26,338
WE APPLY OUR SUNSCREEN,
AND AN HOUR AND A HALF LATER,

00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:28,073
THE SUN IS BEATING DOWN,

00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,410
AND YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU ARE REALLY GETTING RED.

00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,079
NO, I THINK WE'VE GONE
THROUGH THAT MODEL.
SO, WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO
IS PROVIDE THE CONVENIENCE --

00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,981
LOOK, GUYS --
THE OTHER THING,
MR. WONDERFUL --

00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:37,416
LOOK, I'M LOOKING AT IT
SAYING --
LET HIM FINISH HIS SENTENCE.

00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,085
LET <i>ME</i> FINISH <i>MY</i> SENTENCE.
NO. YOU'RE SO RUDE.

00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,087
HE DIDN'T INTERRUPT YOU.
I'M OUT! I'M OUT.

00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,355
ALL RIGHT.
MR. WONDERFUL,
GO BACK THREE WORDS.

00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:45,190
I WANT TO HERE
YOUR SENTENCE.

00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,292
I'M OUT. WHO'S IN?

00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:49,261
Cuban: WHO'S LEFT?
NOBODY.

00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,296
BYE, GUYS. GOOD LUCK.

00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:52,398
BARBARA AND LORI,
IF THERE IS ANY WAY

00:23:52,398 --> 00:23:54,300
YOU WILL RECONSIDER
BEING OUT --
NO.

00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,402
IF THERE IS ANY WAY --
YEAH, GUYS, COME ON!

00:23:56,402 --> 00:23:58,103

YOU'VE GOT --

00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,438
...I APPRECIATE IT, BUT...
Corcoran: THANK YOU.

00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,006
LORI, STOP.

00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:02,074
Herjavec: LORI.
LORI.

00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:04,009
[ Chuckling ] YOU BETTER GO.
THANK YOU.

00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,277
GUYS, I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,046
O'Leary: THANK YOU.
Cuban: GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
Herjavec: THANK YOU.

00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:08,047
Greiner: GOOD LUCK.

00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:09,248
Kaplan:
THE TANK IS REALLY HARD.

00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:12,051
I'VE BEEN IN
A LOT OF ATMOSPHERES,
DONE A LOT OF PITCHES.

00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:14,386
IT'S VERY HARD TO STAY COOL
AND CONSISTENT.

00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,355
WE DID OUR BEST.
WHAT CAN YOU SAY?

00:24:16,355 --> 00:24:19,291
WOW.
EVERY TIME
I ASKED A SIMPLE QUESTION,

00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,260
HE GAVE ME EVERYTHING
BUT THE ANSWER.

00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,395
YEAH, BUT YOU TOTALLY
LOST YOUR COOL.

YOU WERE DEAD ON.

00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:40,312
TO MAKE MEDICAL TESTING
MORE HUMANE AND EFFECTIVE.

THAT MIMIC THE PROPERTIES
OF HUMAN TISSUE.

THESE PRODUCTS ARE USED
THROUGHOUT THE MEDICAL INDUSTRY

00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,319
TO REPLACE LIVE ANIMALS,
HUMAN CADAVERS,

00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:22,488
AND EVEN HUMAN PATIENTS
IN TRAUMA TRAINING,

00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:26,225
SURGICAL EDUCATION,
AND MEDICAL-DEVICE DEVELOPMENT.

00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:28,127
OUR FLAGSHIP PRODUCT
IS WHAT YOU SEE HERE.

IT'S THE SynDaver
SYNTHETIC HUMAN.

00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:32,364
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN
DO PRACTICALLY ANY SURGERY ON.

00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:35,034
SO, WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS

00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:37,036
GET A FEW VOLUNTEERS
TO COME DOWN

00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:39,204
AND TAKE A LOOK AT IT.
YEAH, I'D LIKE TO SEE IT.
I'D LIKE TO LOOK AT IT.

00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,273
ALL RIGHT,
I'M DYING TO SEE IT, TOO.

00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:43,409
SO, YOU CAN FEEL
THAT IT'S MOIST.

00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:46,311
THIS IS ABOUT 85% WATER
BY MASS.

00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,047
IT HAS EVERY MUSCLE,

00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,449

IN NATURAL HUMAN ANATOMY.

LIKE CHICKEN -- RAW CHICKEN.

LIKE LIVE TISSUE.

WE'VE SPENT
ABOUT 20 YEARS DOING

00:25:57,189 --> 00:25:59,091
THE DEVELOPMENT
OF THE TISSUES ITSELF.

00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:01,026
AND HOW DO YOU DO SURGERY ON IT?
CAN YOU CUT IT?

00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:02,027
YOU CAN CUT IT.

00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:04,129

00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:11,036
Herjavec: WHAT'S THE PRICE POINT
COMPARED TO A CADAVER?

00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,305
IT COSTS A LOT MORE.
THIS DOES?

00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:15,240
'CAUSE THIS IS REUSABLE.
A CADAVER'S NOT.
HOW MUCH IS THIS?

00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,408
A CADAVER WILL COST YOU
5 GRAND,

00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,177
10 GRAND DEPENDING
ON WHERE YOU ARE.

00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:21,246

TELL US ABOUT YOUR COMPANY.

00:26:42,134 --> 00:26:45,370
WELL, WE STARTED IN MY GARAGE
ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO.

00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,206
I DIDN'T THINK DOCTORS
STARTED IN GARAGES.

00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:48,440
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
FOR TECH PEOPLE.

00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,210
WELL, I'M A PhD.
I'M A PhD DOCTOR.

00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,377

AND MY BACHELOR'S
IS MECHANICAL ENGINEERING.

I USED TO DO
A LOT OF ANIMAL TESTING.

00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,452
THE EXPENSE THAT'S ASSOCIATED
WITH ANIMAL STUDIES

00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:03,122
IS PRETTY HORRENDOUS.
WHY?

00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:04,289
JUST BECAUSE OF ALL
THE ASSOCIATED PROFESSIONALS

00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,324

THE ANESTHESIOLOGISTS,
VETERINARIANS,

00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,394
THE FACILITIES YOU HAVE TO HAVE
TO HOUSE THEM.

00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:12,297
IT'S INTERESTING STUFF. YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR $3 MILLION FOR 10%.

00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,299
YOU'RE VALUING THE COMPANY
AT $30 MILLION.

00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,168
YOU MUST HAVE SOME SALES.

00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:28,313
WE DID $5 MILLION
THIS YEAR.

00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,149
BUT HOW SHOULD I VALUE
YOUR BUSINESS.

00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:33,452
WELL, WE'VE GOT SALES
THAT ARE DOUBLING EVERY YEAR.

00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:36,288
WE'RE ALSO PART OF A JOINT
VENTURE THAT'S VYING FOR,

00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:40,192
YOU KNOW, $150 MILLION
IN U.S. BUSINESS NEXT YEAR.

00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:41,360
IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE
THAT'S DOING THIS?

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,495
WE ARE THE ONLY COMPANY
IN THE WORLD THAT DOES THIS,

00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,130
AND WE HAVE 10 ISSUED PATENTS
THAT COVER THE TECHNOLOGY.

00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,999
O'Leary: SO, I'M FAMILIAR WITH
THE MEDICAL-DEVICE SECTOR.

00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:50,135
I INVEST IN IT,
AND THE PUBLIC COMPANIES

00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:51,303
THAT ARE A HUNDRED TIMES
LARGER THAN YOU

00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:54,039
TRADE BETWEEN 11 AND 20 TIMES
THEIR FREE CASH.

00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:56,074
THAT'S THE RANGE.

00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:59,311
I MEAN, WE COULD BE MAKING QUITE
A BIT OF MONEY IF I WANTED TO.

00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:01,246
WHOA.

00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:03,081
WHY DO YOU NOT WANT TO?
WELL, THAT'S A GOOD THING.

00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:04,149
'CAUSE HE WANTS TO KEEP ON
GROWING THE COMPANY.

00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:05,284
I'M NOT AT ALL INTERESTED
IN THE MONEY.

00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:07,419
IT'S JUST A TOOL TO ME
THAT I USE TO HIRE PEOPLE.

00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,421
YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED
IN MAKING MONEY?

00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:11,023
THAT'S NOT MY MOTIVATION.

00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:13,091
MEDICAL TRAINING
IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.

00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:14,193
IT'S A WAY TO SAVE LIVES.

00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:17,129
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE PROFITS?
DO YOU CARE ABOUT THOSE?

00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:19,431
I WILL AT SOME POINT.

00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,366
THAT'S NOT ENCOURAGING WORDS
TO AN INVESTOR.

00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,235
YOU WANT ME TO GIVE YOU
$3 MILLION FOR 10%.

00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:26,205
YOU'RE IMPUTING
A $30 MILLION VALUE ON IT.

00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,040
WELL, THAT'S BASED
ON THE ASSUMPTION

00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,142
THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE
MUCH MORE VALUABLE LATER ON.

00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:32,177
EVERYBODY THAT COMES
IN THE SHARK TANK SAYS THAT

00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:35,047
WHETHER THEY'RE SELLING CANDY
OR DEAD GUYS.

00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:38,283
HERE'S WHAT DOESN'T ADD UP
FOR ME.

00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:41,386
I GOT TO BELIEVE YOU'RE ONE OF
THE TOP GUYS IN THIS FIELD.

00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,222
I'M THE WORLD LEADER
IN THIS FIELD, YEAH.
OKAY.

00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:45,424
WHY AREN'T PEOPLE BEATING
A PATH TO YOUR DOOR?

00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:47,092
Corcoran:
HE'S MISSING A BUSINESSMAN.

00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:49,394
YOU NEED A BUSINESSMAN TO
MAKE MONEY, AND YOU'RE NOT HIM.

00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,163
BUT YOU CANNOT
BUILD A BUSINESS

00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:53,465
UNLESS YOU'RE INTERESTED
IN MAKING A PROFIT.

00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:55,033
I'M OUT.

00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:56,268
OKAY. WELL, THANK YOU.

00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:59,037
UM, I DON'T AGREE
WITH YOUR STATEMENT

00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:00,973
THAT I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN PROFIT.

00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:03,408
I WOULD SAY THAT IT IS NOT

00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,978
WHAT I'M INTERESTED IN
RIGHT NOW.
TOP PRIORITY.

00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:07,346
BUT THINK ABOUT HOW THAT SOUNDS
TO AN INVESTOR.
Greiner: RIGHT.

00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:09,314
Herjavec: YOU KNOW WHAT?
TO ME IT SOUNDS

00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:11,116
ABSOLUTELY LOGICAL
AND REASONABLE.

00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:12,417
'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA LOOK
LIKE THAT THING ON THE TABLE

00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,087
BEFORE YOU GET
YOUR MONEY BACK.

00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:16,121
THAT IS NOT TRUE AT ALL.

00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:17,456
WELL, WHEN AM I GETTING
MY MONEY BACK?

00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:19,291
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:23,128
WELL, THAT'S
A GOOD ANSWER, RIGHT?
YOU WERE RIGHT, CHRIS.

00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:24,196
IT'S AN HONEST ANSWER.
CHRIS, YOU WERE RIGHT.

00:29:24,196 --> 00:29:26,031
I KEEP ASKING YOU THE QUESTION
15 DIFFERENT WAYS --

00:29:26,031 --> 00:29:28,033
WHEN AND HOW DO I GET
MY MONEY BACK?

00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:30,102
AND HOW MANY TIMES MULTIPLE
DO I GET?

00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:31,403
GET ME EXCITED
ABOUT THAT.

00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:35,274
WELL, IT'S -- I DON'T KNOW
THAT I CAN PREDICT

00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:36,441
HOW LARGE WE'RE GOING TO BE

00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,443
BECAUSE IT'S A NEW SECTOR
THAT'S BEEN CREATED.

00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:43,315
SEE, YOU DON'T HAVE THAT PASSION
ABOUT DRIVING THE BUSINESS.

00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:46,184
AND I UNDERSTAND.
YOU'RE A SCIENTIST.

00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:48,186
THIS IS WHAT DRIVES YOU.

00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:50,022
BUT FOR ME TO INVEST
IN YOU,

00:29:50,022 --> 00:29:53,358
I HAVE TO FEEL THAT YOU'RE
GOING TO PROTECT MY INVESTMENT

00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:55,294
AND MAKE IT THRIVE.

00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:57,362
AND I DIDN'T HEAR THAT
HERE TODAY.

00:29:57,362 --> 00:30:00,032
AND FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.

00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:01,433
THANK YOU.

00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:04,069
O'Leary: THE SALES ARE
A LITTLE UNDERWHELMING

00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:07,072
GIVEN THE POTENTIAL
THAT YOU TALK ABOUT.

00:30:07,072 --> 00:30:09,007
BUT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
ABLE TO ARTICULATE

00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:10,976
WHAT MY EXPECTATIONS
SHOULD BE.

00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:14,112
DON'T YOU SEE THE RISK IN THAT
IN TERMS OF GETTING A DEAL?

00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:15,280
I DO.

00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,182
AND YOU DON'T CARE.
[ CHUCKLES ]

00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:18,417
I WOULDN'T SAY I DON'T CARE.
I JUST DON'T WANT TO --

00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:20,185
LET ME TALK
TO THE DEAD GUY.

00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:22,087
I DON'T WANT TO --
I DON'T WANT TO LIE TO YOU.

00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:23,322
I'M OUT.

00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:27,059
Herjavec:
I'M NOT IN THIS SPACE,

00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:28,460
BUT I LIKE COMPLEXITY.

00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,195
IT'S A BIG BARRIER TO ENTRY
TO OTHER PEOPLE.

00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:32,297
I THINK
YOU'RE ON TO SOMETHING.

00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:36,168
I THINK WHAT'S MISSING IS SIMPLY
AN AVENUE TO SALES

00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:38,170
AND DISTRIBUTION
AND MARKETING.

00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,005
AND KEVIN'S
PARTLY RIGHT --

00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:43,975
YOU SEEM A LITTLE HESITANT
ABOUT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT.

00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:46,278
I'M A SCIENTIST.
I'M -- I'M NOT THAT GUY.

00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:49,181
CHRISTOPHER,
HERE'S MY OFFER.

00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:55,187
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $3 MILLION FOR 35%,

00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:58,023
AND AN EQUAL
BOARD REPRESENTATION.

00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:01,026
I'M NOT TRYING TO CONTROL YOU,
BUT I NEED SOMEBODY

00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:04,129
ON THAT BOARD
WHO'S WAKING UP WITH A PASSION

00:31:04,129 --> 00:31:08,266
TO GO TO MARKET AND SELL THIS
STUFF WITH THE SAME PASSION

00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:13,071
THAT YOU HAVE
FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.

00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:14,973
I'M SORRY, ROBERT.

00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:17,209
I'D LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU,
BUT THAT'S JUST --

00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:19,311
THAT'S MORE EQUITY THAN I'M
PREPARED TO GIVE UP RIGHT NOW.

00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:22,981
I KNOW THIS IS NOT THE LAST
MONEY I'M GONNA HAVE TO RAISE.

00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:24,282
AND IF I GIVE UP
A THIRD OF THE COMPANY NOW,

00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:26,284
THERE WON'T BE ENOUGH LEFT
IN THE TANK TO GET THERE.

00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:28,320
THAT'S AN $8.5 MILLION VALUATION
ROBERT JUST MADE YOU,

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,322
AND YOU'VE PASSED ON THAT.

00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:33,058
I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE
THE OFFER, ROBERT,

00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:35,160
BUT, AT THAT LEVEL OF EQUITY,
I-I CAN'T ACCEPT.

00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,062
I'M SORRY.

00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:40,165
LOOK, CHRIS YOU MADE
AN EDUCATED GUESS, IF YOU WILL,

00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:42,100
ON WHAT
THE BEST VALUATION IS.

00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,435
THERE'S A LONG WAY TO GO.

00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:46,104
IF EVERYTHING YOU'RE SAYING
IS TRUE IN TERMS OF COMPETITION,

00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:47,372
$50 MILLION VALUATION

00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:49,374
IS UNDERSELLING YOURSELF
DRAMATICALLY, RIGHT?

00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:52,110
THE -- THE TECHNOLOGY
IS ONLY GONNA GET BETTER.

00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,345
YOU'RE ONLY GONNA IMPROVE
THE PRODUCT.

00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:55,447
I JUST CAN'T MAKE
THOSE DECISIONS RIGHT NOW.

00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:59,284
AND TO JUST THROW $3 MILLION
AT IT AND HOPE I GOT IT RIGHT --

00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:01,219
IT'S NOT
ABOUT THE VALUATION.

00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:02,387
IT'S ABOUT
THE RISK/REWARD.

00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:04,289
AND SO, FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.

00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:07,325
OKAY. THANK YOU.
CHRISTOPHER.

00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:09,194
YOU'RE SAYING NO TO 35%.
I'M GONNA --

00:32:09,194 --> 00:32:11,029
I'M GONNA NEGOTIATE
AGAINST MYSELF.

00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:12,297
I MEAN, THAT'S HOW INTERESTED
I AM IN THIS.

00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:14,366
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $3 MILLION

00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:18,003
FOR 25% WITH EQUAL
REPRESENTATION ON THE BOARD.

00:32:18,003 --> 00:32:20,205
THAT'S MY FINAL OFFER.

00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,177
YOU GOT A DEAL.

00:32:25,177 --> 00:32:27,078
ALL RIGHT.
Cuban: THERE YOU GO.

00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:29,414
THANK YOU. YEAH.
WOW. GO, ROBERT.

00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:31,383
THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT.

00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:33,985
I KEEP THE DEAD BODY.

00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:35,253
I'LL MAKE YOU
A SPECIAL ONE.

00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:37,289
[ LAUGHS ]
THAT'S $40,000 WORTH
OF INVENTORY.

ALWAYS BEEN MY FAVORITE.

00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:40,025
WE'RE BOTH TECHIES.

00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:41,393
THIS INVESTMENT WILL ULTIMATELY
ALLOW US TO SAVE

00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:45,497
A LOT OF ANIMALS' LIVES,
A LOT OF PEOPLE'S LIVES,

00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:47,132
AND DO A LOT OF GOOD
IN THE WORLD.

00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,133
I THINK IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:49,367
HIRE A C.E.O. FOR HIM?
YEAH.

00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:51,403
HE NEEDS SOMEBODY
WHO'S GONNA RUN THE BUSINESS.
ABSOLUTELY.

00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:54,339
HE IS THE CLASSIC EXAMPLE
OF A BRILLIANT GUY

00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:56,107
THAT NEEDS A C.E.O.
EARLY ON.

00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:57,375
DEFINITELY.
BUT LET ME ASK YOU --

00:32:57,375 --> 00:33:00,245
ARE YOU GONNA TAKE AN INSURANCE
POLICY OUT ON THE SCIENTIST.

00:33:00,245 --> 00:33:02,080
I DON'T THINK
HE'S GONNA MAKE IT MUCH LONGER.

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,348
HE HARDLY HAS A HEARTBEAT.

00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:05,450

THAN THAT GUY.

00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:38,276
ARE YOU READY TO SEE YOURSELVES
AS HEROES?
YES.
YES.

00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:41,012
YES.
ALL RIGHT.

00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:42,981
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:45,216
OH, MY GOSH,
IT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE ME.

00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:47,285
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:49,087
WOW.
OH, I LOVE MINE.

00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,255
I LOVE IT.

00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:52,190
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THE FACE BUT --

00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,060
OH, YEAH.

00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,461
AND WHAT'S AMAZING IS
THE BODY IS EXACTLY --

00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:58,063
EXACTLY, I KNOW.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:34:58,063 --> 00:35:00,332
I MEAN,
YOU GOT THE BODY DOWN.

00:35:00,332 --> 00:35:02,400
WE ACTUALLY PICKED OUT
SOME SUPERPOWERS FOR YOU...

00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,302
OH.
...AND NAMES,
SO, ROBERT, YOU HAVE

00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:07,238
THE POWER OF SUPER SPEED,
AND YOU ARE THE ACCELERATOR.

00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:10,075
OOH, THE ACCELERATOR!
I LIKE IT.

00:35:10,075 --> 00:35:13,178
Andrews: LORI, YOU HAVE
IMAGINATION MANIFESTATION,

00:35:13,178 --> 00:35:14,412
AND YOU ARE ENCHANTRA.

00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:16,348
OH, I LOVE IT.
ENCHANTRA!

00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:17,415
Glidewell: KEVIN, YOU HAVE
A POWER I WOULD LIKE,

00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:20,085
WHICH IS THE POWER
OF WINE MANIPULATION.

00:35:20,085 --> 00:35:21,286
AND WE CALLED YOU
THE VINIFICATOR.

00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:24,155
Cuban: THE VINIFICATOR!
WOW.

00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:27,325
BARBARA, YOU HAVE PRECOGNITION,
AND YOU ARE THE HUNCH.

00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:32,163
MM.
Glidewell:
AND, MARK, YOU HAVE THE POWER
OF SUPERHUMAN INTUITION,

00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:34,332
OF COURSE I DO.
AND YOU ARE
THE GAME CHANGER!

00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:36,968
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT'S UP,
BABY.
I HAD TO DO THAT.

00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,136
HOW DID YOU COME UP
WITH THE IDEA?

00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:41,072
OKAY, SO, I USED TO BE
A VOICEOVER ARTIST

00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:43,074
AND A MOTION-CAPTURE
MODEL.

00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:44,242
OH, WOW.

00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:46,244
SO, I GOT THE LUCKY OPPORTUNITY
OF BEING THE MODEL

00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:48,279
FOR A CHARACTER
IN A VIDEO GAME.

00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:50,281
AND THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS,
I LEARNED A LITTLE BIT

00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:53,351
ABOUT 3-D MODELING AND HOW
THEY TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS OF YOU

00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:55,420
AND BASICALLY TURN IT
INTO A MODEL.

00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:58,323
MY BACKGROUND IS
IN WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT

00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:01,059
AND ALSO
IN DIGITAL MARKETING.

00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:05,096
BEFORE QUITTING
MY FULL-TIME JOB AT MICROSOFT

00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:06,264
TO START THIS COMPANY --
WHAT DID YOU DO AT MICROSOFT?

00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:08,466
I WAS WORKING
FOR THE BING SEARCH ENGINE.

00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:10,268
I REALLY GOT LEARN
THE INS AND OUTS

00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:11,403
OF HOW SEARCH ENGINES WORK

00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:14,139
AND HOW TO DRIVE CUSTOMERS
TO WEBSITES.

00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:15,273
SO, HAVE YOU SOLD
ANYTHING?

00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:17,108
WE HAVEN'T GONE
TO MARKET YET.

00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:18,209
YOU HAVEN'T?
WE JUST, LITERALLY,

00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,145
A MONTH AGO FINISHED
THE CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGN.

00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:21,179
OOH.
Greiner: OH, OKAY.

00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,248
SO, YOU HAVEN'T SOLD ANY.

00:36:23,248 --> 00:36:25,116
DO YOU KNOW, THOUGH,
WHAT IT WOULD COST YOU

00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:27,152
TO MAKE ONE AND WHAT YOU'RE
THINKING OF SELLING IT FOR?
Andrews: OH, YES.

00:36:27,152 --> 00:36:31,289
SURE. IT COSTS $15,
AND WE SELL THEM FOR $60.

00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:32,457
WHAT'S THE CAPACITY
YOU HAVE?

00:36:32,457 --> 00:36:37,195
WE CAN PRINT ABOUT 100 A DAY
PER 3-D PRINTER.

00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,497
WHAT DO
THE PRINTERS COST?

00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:41,099
IF THEY'RE NEW, $45,000.

00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:44,269
WE HAVE BOUGHT BOTH OF OURS USED
FOR ABOUT $20,000.

00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:46,371
IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE
THAT MAKES SOMETHING SIMILAR?

00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:47,405
IS THERE ANY COMPETITION?

00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:49,240
SURE, THERE A COUPLE
OF OTHER COMPANIES

00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,110
THAT MAKE
PERSONALIZED ACTION FIGURES.

00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:55,180
HOW ARE THEY DOING? ARE THEY --
ARE THEY BIG COMPANIES?

00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,348
THEY'RE SMALL.
THEY'RE ALL SMALL.

00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:59,017
WE DID A LOT
OF MARKET RESEARCH

00:36:59,017 --> 00:37:00,351
BEFORE EVEN ENTERING
INTO THIS SPACE.

00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:01,386
ONCE YOU DID
THAT RESEARCH,

00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:03,988
WHO DID YOU DECIDE
WAS YOUR BEST CUSTOMER?

00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:07,158
THE BEST CUSTOMERS ARE AGED
ABOUT 30 TO 45.

00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:08,259
OH, REALLY?
MEN, WOMEN?

00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:10,428
SO, YOU'RE NOT THINKING
OF THIS FOR CHILDREN.

00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:12,197
ACTUALLY,
WE WERE GOING INTO THIS

00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:14,466
EXPECTING THAT MORE PEOPLE WERE
GONNA WANT TO BUY THEM FOR KIDS.

00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:17,035
AND OVERWHELMINGLY,
WE FOUND THAT PEOPLE WANTED

00:37:17,035 --> 00:37:18,303
TO BUY THESE
FOR OTHER ADULTS.

00:37:18,303 --> 00:37:21,139
SOMEBODY REACHED OUT AND SAID
HE WAS BUYING ONE FOR HIS WIFE

00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:22,440
FOR BEING A SUPER MOM.

00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,309
OH, THAT'S CUTE.
SOMEBODY ELSE REACHED OUT,

00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:26,277
SAID SHE'S BUYING ONE
FOR HER AUNT

00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:27,979
WHO HAD JUST SURVIVED
BREAST CANCER.

00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:29,380
RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
I THINK IT'S VERY CLEVER.

00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,383
NOW I'M TRYING TO THINK --
HOW DO YOU CONTINUE TO SCALE

00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:34,219
AND BUILD COMPETITIVE
ADVANTAGES?

00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:35,386
RIGHT.

00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:37,088
IS THERE ANYTHING PROPRIETARY
ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,423
THE THING
WITH 3-D PRINTING --

00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:40,391
IT IS A NEW TECHNOLOGY,
RIGHT?

00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:42,327
AND SO THERE'S NOT
A LOT OF SOFTWARE OUT THERE

00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:44,362
THAT IS AVAILABLE
TO SUPPORT,

00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:46,431
ESPECIALLY
FULL-COLOR 3-D PRINTING.

00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:48,466
AND SO WE BUILT
OUR OWN SOFTWARE,

00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:51,002
WHICH IS PATENT-PENDING.

00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,203
HOW MUCH DID YOU INVEST
IN THIS?

00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:54,372
AND IS IT ALL YOU MONEY?
IT'S ALL OUR MONEY, AND SO FAR,

00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:58,143
WE'VE PUT IN
ABOUT $120,000.

00:37:58,143 --> 00:38:00,345
Corcoran: KERI,
CAN I ADDRESS THE RESEMBLANCE?

00:38:00,345 --> 00:38:02,313
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
THESE HEADS LOOK LIKE US.

00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:06,484
I DON'T THINK
THAT LOOKS LIKE ME.

00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:08,219
LOOK AT KEVIN.

00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:10,321
OTHER THAN THE FACT
THAT THAT'S A BALD HEAD,

00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:12,290
I WOULD NOT SAY THAT
THAT RESEMBLED KEVIN.

00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,292
THAT DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE MARK.

00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,393
SO I'M CONCERNED.
BUT SHE'S RIGHT, THOUGH.
IT'S AN ISSUE.

00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:17,262
Corcoran: THE SEAM
ON THE NECK -- IS THAT A MUST?

00:38:17,262 --> 00:38:20,131
BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU CHOPPED OFF A HEAD

00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,233
AND STUCK ANOTHER HEAD
ON THERE.

00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,103
IT'S NOT WELL-MATCHED,
THE COLORATION,

00:38:25,103 --> 00:38:26,104
NOR IS THE SPACING GOOD.

00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:39,017
Corcoran: KERI,
CAN I ADDRESS THE RESEMBLANCE?

00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:40,485
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
THESE HEADS LOOK LIKE US.

00:38:43,221 --> 00:38:45,123
I DON'T THINK
THAT LOOKS LIKE ME.

00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:47,425
I WOULD NOT SAY THAT
THAT RESEMBLED KEVIN.

00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:49,427
THAT DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE MARK.

00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:52,197
SO I'M CONCERNED.
BUT SHE'S RIGHT THOUGH.
IT'S AN ISSUE.

00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:54,232
I TAKE EXCEPTION
TO THE QUALITY ISSUE

00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:55,333
AND THE SEAM
ON THE NECK.

00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,267
Andrews: HERE'S THE THING --
YOU KNOW, FIRST --

00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:58,102
FIRST,
THERE'S ONLY ONE COMPANY

00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:00,271
THAT MAKES
THE FULL-COLOR 3-D PRINTERS,

00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:02,273
AND SO THERE IS
SOME LIMITATIONS

00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:04,409
WHEN IT COMES TO JUST

00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:06,277
THE DETAIL THAT CAN BE PRINTED.
PRECISION, RIGHT?

00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:08,213
BUT THE PRECISION IS KEY
TO THE SALE ON THIS.

00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:11,182
AND UNTIL
THAT'S PERFECTED,

00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,284
I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE
A LOT OF RETURNS.

00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:16,120
SO I'M OUT.

00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,155
OKAY.

00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,425
I DON'T SEE THAT.

00:39:20,425 --> 00:39:23,394
MY FIRST REACTION
WHEN YOU GAVE IT TO ME

00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:25,396
WAS, "WOW, IT REALLY LOOKS
A LOT LIKE ME."

00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:27,465
OF COURSE YOU'RE GONNA FIND
FAULT WITH IT,

00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:30,001
BUT IT'S A GIFT.
MM-HMM.

00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:32,036
ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
I AM THE ACCELERATOR.

00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,171
YES.

00:39:33,171 --> 00:39:34,172
SO I LIKE THE IDEA.

00:39:34,172 --> 00:39:35,273
I THINK THERE'S
A LOT OF CHALLENGES.

00:39:35,273 --> 00:39:37,141
SURE.
I REALLY DO.

00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:38,209
BUT I THINK
YOU'LL GET THERE.

00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,277
I MEAN, YOU GUYS HAVE
A GREAT BACKGROUND.

00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:41,412
BUT OBVIOUSLY,
I SEE RISK.

00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:44,082
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $100,000 FOR 25%.

00:39:44,082 --> 00:39:46,451
THAT'S, UH --

00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:48,386
I'D LIKE TO HEAR
IF THERE ARE OTHER OFFERS.

00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:51,189
WHAT COMES NEXT
FOR YOU GUYS?

00:39:51,189 --> 00:39:53,324
ONE OF THE THINGS WE SEE
THAT THE SOFTWARE CAN BE

00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:54,459
OUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.

00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:57,328
IN ADDITION TO
THOSE PERSONALIZED CHARACTERS,

00:39:57,328 --> 00:40:02,033
WE WANT TO EXPLORE DIGITAL
PRODUCTS WITH THE SOFTWARE,

00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:04,335
WHERE YOU COULD USE
THE -- THE 3-D HEAD

00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:06,204
WITHOUT NECESSARILY
NEEDING TO

00:40:06,204 --> 00:40:08,006
PHYSICALLY PRINT OUT
AN OBJECT.

00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:10,008
AS A CONSUMER,
WHAT WOULD I DO WITH THAT?
YOU COULD DO...

00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:12,043
MAKING AN AVATAR
THAT LOOKS LIKE ME?

00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:13,177
YOU COULD DO AVATARS
AND --

00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:14,245
YOU COULD TURN IT
INTO GAME PIECES.

00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,147
YEAH, IN HIGH-END GAMES,
YOU COULD.
GAMES.

00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:18,983
I THINK THAT'S FRINGE
SORT OF VERSUS --
NO, NO.

00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:20,051
THAT'S ACTUALLY
PROBABLY BIGGER BUSINESS.

00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:21,286
I DON'T KNOW.
[ LAUGHS ]

00:40:21,286 --> 00:40:23,054
WHEN LOW-COST
COLOR PRINTERS COME OUT,

00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:25,123
ONE OF THE THINGS PEOPLE
ARE GONNA WANT TO DO

00:40:25,123 --> 00:40:26,324
IS EMULATE THEMSELVES,

00:40:26,324 --> 00:40:28,226
AND THERE WILL BE OTHER APPS
THAT WILL DO THAT.

00:40:28,226 --> 00:40:30,261
SO I THINK
YOU HAVE TO RUN, LIKE,

00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,130
VERY FAST
TO GET SOME MARKET SHARE

00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,431
WITH A BRAND
THAT PEOPLE KNOW.

00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,968
AND I'M GONNA MAKE
THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE MARGINS

00:40:36,968 --> 00:40:38,970
IS GONNA GET SHRUNK
PRETTY QUICKLY

00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,271
AS OTHERS COMPETE.

00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:43,007
YOU PUT HERE
A $1 MILLION VALUATION --

00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:44,409
IT'S AGGRESSIVE.

00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:46,978
BUT I'LL DO 100K.

00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:50,048
I'M GONNA TAKE $10
OFF OF EVERY DOLL

00:40:50,048 --> 00:40:51,282
UNTIL I RECOUP THE 100K,

00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:54,419
AND THEN IT'S GONNA DROP
TO $2.50 IN PERPETUITY,

00:40:54,419 --> 00:40:56,421
AND I'M GETTING 5% EQUITY.

00:40:56,421 --> 00:40:58,456
SO I'M VALUING
YOUR BUSINESS TODAY...

00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,025
TRY TO REPEAT THAT.
...AT $2 MILLION.

00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:02,260
THAT'S, LIKE,
ONE OF YOUR WORST ONES.

00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,461
SO I'M SAYING
YOU'RE WORTH $2 MILLION TODAY --

00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,163
TWICE WHAT YOU ASKED FOR.

00:41:05,163 --> 00:41:07,098
BUT I'M PUTTING
A STRUCTURE IN PLACE

00:41:07,098 --> 00:41:08,132
THAT RECOUPS MY MONEY

00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,034
BEFORE I THINK
THE MARGINS GET CRUSHED.

00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:11,302
AND I'M SAYING
YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,403
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT TOGETHER

00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:14,238
'CAUSE I HAVE AN INCENTIVE
TO STAY IN THE GAME.

00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:16,174
HE JUST WENT
FROM BEING A SUPERHERO

00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:18,309
