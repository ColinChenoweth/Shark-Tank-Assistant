WHAT IF WE OFFERED YOU
$1 MILLION TO JUST BUY IT OUT?

00:00:23,121 --> 00:00:24,523
DON'T MAKE A MISTAKE.

00:00:24,523 --> 00:00:27,359
Narrator: BUT THE ENTREPRENEURS
MUST GET THE FULL AMOUNT

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,228
THEY'RE ASKING FOR, OR THEY'LL
WALK AWAY WITH NOTHING.

00:00:30,228 --> 00:00:32,197
THIS IS ALL GOOD NEWS.
WHERE'S THE BAD NEWS?

00:00:32,197 --> 00:00:33,465

00:01:42,401 --> 00:01:44,336
RAY AND I GREW UP
IN THE SAME NEIGHBORHOOD,

00:01:44,336 --> 00:01:47,039
NEVER REALLY HUNG OUT
UNTIL I MARRIED MY WIFE,

00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:49,107
WHO HAPPENED TO HAVE GONE TO
THE SAME HIGH SCHOOL WITH RAY.

00:01:49,107 --> 00:01:52,210
NOW WE'RE CLOSE FRIENDS
AND BUSINESS PARTNERS, TOO.

00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,179
OH,
THAT LOOKS LIKE FUN.

00:01:54,179 --> 00:01:56,014
I CAME UP WITH THE IDEA
FOR THIS BUSINESS

00:01:56,014 --> 00:01:58,083
WHILE WORKING AT A TREATMENT
FACILITY FOR CHILDREN,

00:01:58,083 --> 00:01:59,451
AND ONE OF THE MORE
DIFFICULT TIMES WAS BATH TIME.

00:01:59,451 --> 00:02:00,519
THERE WAS ONE KID
IN PARTICULAR

00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:02,320
WHO HAD REFUSED TO BATHE
FOR A FEW DAYS.

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,089
HE LET ME KNOW
WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS,

00:02:04,089 --> 00:02:06,224
AND THAT'S WHEN I HAD
MY "AHA" MOMENT.

00:02:06,224 --> 00:02:08,360
I SPENT YEARS DEVELOPING
AND IMPROVING A PRODUCT,

00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,428
BUT STILL,
SOMETHING WAS MISSING.

00:02:09,428 --> 00:02:11,496
THEN I REALIZED ALVIN
HAD HIS OWN DESIGN COMPANY,

00:02:11,496 --> 00:02:13,532
SO I ASKED HIM TO HELP ME
DESIGN THE PRODUCT FURTHER.

00:02:13,532 --> 00:02:15,167
THAT LOOKS
REALLY, REALLY GOOD.

00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:17,069
WE HAVE A LOT OF INTEREST
FROM MAJOR RETAILERS,

00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:19,371
BUT WE CAN'T SCALE FAST ENOUGH
TO GET OUR PRODUCT OUT THERE.

00:02:19,371 --> 00:02:22,207
WE NEED THE SHARKS'
EXPERTISE AND CAPITAL

00:02:22,207 --> 00:02:24,142
TO TAKE OUR PRODUCT
NATIONWIDE.

00:02:24,142 --> 00:02:25,277
Uy:
THIS IS IT FOR US.

00:02:25,277 --> 00:02:28,313

00:03:15,093 --> 00:03:16,161
HOW DO I GET MY KID

00:03:16,161 --> 00:03:17,329
WITHOUT THE SCREAMING
AND CRYING?

00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:18,330

TO BATH TIME.

00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,341
OH, LORD.

00:03:29,341 --> 00:03:31,143
WHAT WE'VE DONE IS TAKE

00:03:31,143 --> 00:03:32,444
TURNED IT
INTO A BATH AID

00:03:32,444 --> 00:03:34,513
BY SIMPLY REPLACING
ITS INNER STUFFING

00:03:34,513 --> 00:03:36,114
WITH ANTIMICROBIAL SPONGE

00:03:36,114 --> 00:03:38,450

LET ME SHOW YOU
HOW IT WORKS.

00:03:40,218 --> 00:03:42,420
SIMPLY TAKE SOAP AND PUT IT

00:03:56,168 --> 00:03:58,036
AND LET BATH TIME BEGIN.

00:03:58,036 --> 00:03:59,104
AND AFTER BATH TIME...

00:04:00,105 --> 00:04:01,206
...SIMPLY HANG SoapSox
TO DRY

00:04:01,206 --> 00:04:03,041
OR JUST TOSS IT
INTO THE LAUNDRY.

00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,043
SO, SHARKS,
WHY DON'T YOU LET US

00:04:05,043 --> 00:04:06,411
THROW SOME SoapSox
INTO YOUR TANK

00:04:06,411 --> 00:04:08,313

00:04:19,424 --> 00:04:20,525
[GREINER CHUCKLES]
YOU GET THE PINK HIPPO
BECAUSE,

00:04:20,525 --> 00:04:22,227
YOU KNOW,
HIPPOS ARE NICE AND CUDDLY

00:04:22,227 --> 00:04:23,461
AND THEY LOOK THE PART,

00:04:23,461 --> 00:04:25,330
BUT THEY'RE THE MOST DANGEROUS
ANIMALS OUT THERE IN THE WORLD.

00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,265
THANK YOU. YEAH.
OH, YOU KNOW
HOW TO FLATTER.

00:04:27,265 --> 00:04:28,366

OKAY,

00:04:30,235 --> 00:04:32,204
AND WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE
YOU HAD THAT.

00:04:32,204 --> 00:04:35,106

KNOWN TO SPIT SOME FIRE,

00:04:35,106 --> 00:04:37,242
SO WE FIGURED WE'D COMPLIMENT

00:04:37,242 --> 00:04:39,044

00:04:41,112 --> 00:04:42,447
FOR THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY
TO GET YOUR DEALS,

SO WE FIGURED
IT'D BE APPROPRIATE

00:04:44,082 --> 00:04:45,283
TO GIVE YOU THE GATOR.
I LIKE THESE GUYS.

00:04:45,283 --> 00:04:47,385

00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,222
HE'S THE BIGGEST SHARK OF THEM
ALL, SO WE WANTED TO MAKE --

00:04:50,222 --> 00:04:51,389
OH, PLEASE!
John: OH, WHATEVER.

00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:53,225
[GROWLS]
YOU SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN
A DONKEY FOR MARK.

00:04:53,225 --> 00:04:54,359
OH!

00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:56,161
WHAT'S YOUR HISTORY
IN BUSINESS

00:04:56,161 --> 00:04:57,495
TO COME UP WITH THIS IDEA?

00:04:57,495 --> 00:05:00,165
SO, I WORKED AT A RESIDENTIAL
TREATMENT FACILITY

00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:01,433
FOR ABUSED KIDS
FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS,

00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:05,170
AND ONE OF THE MORE DIFFICULT
TIMES WAS BATH TIME.

00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,505
WE HAD ONE KID IN PARTICULAR
WHO HAD REFUSED TO BATHE,

00:05:07,505 --> 00:05:09,441
AND WE WAS CARRYING
A LITTLE STUFFED ANIMAL.

00:05:09,441 --> 00:05:11,176
AND HE WAS LIKE,
"THAT MEAN LADY

00:05:11,176 --> 00:05:12,477
"WON'T LET ME
TAKE MY STUFFED ANIMAL

00:05:12,477 --> 00:05:14,079
INTO THE BATHTUB WITH ME."

00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:16,248
AND SO I SAID, "WE CAN --
WE CAN FIX THAT. HOLD ON."

00:05:16,248 --> 00:05:17,482
AND I THOUGHT
OUTSIDE OF THE BOX,

00:05:17,482 --> 00:05:19,217
I HAD THE STAFF GRAB
ANOTHER STUFFED ANIMAL,

00:05:19,217 --> 00:05:21,253
MADE IT HOLD SOAP,
LATHERED IT UP,

00:05:21,253 --> 00:05:23,188
AND HE WAS LIKE,
"OKAY, I'LL GO."

00:05:23,188 --> 00:05:25,557
AND SO, AFTER THAT,
THEN THEY'RE LIKE,

00:05:25,557 --> 00:05:27,259
"HEY,
MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO FOR IT."

00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:29,160
AND SO THEN,
I PARTNERED WITH ALVIN,

00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,330
WHO HAS A BACKGROUND IN DESIGN
AND PRODUCT DESIGN,

00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,531
AND HE MADE THE MAGIC
HAPPEN.

00:05:33,531 --> 00:05:37,269
GIVE US A SALES PROFILE
AND WHICH RETAILERS YOU'RE IN.

00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:39,137
THIS IS A RETAIL-ORIENTED
PRODUCT.

00:05:39,137 --> 00:05:40,438
SO, WE'VE BEEN ON THE MARKET
FOR SIX MONTHS,

00:05:40,438 --> 00:05:41,506
WE'VE DONE $300,000
IN SALES.

00:05:41,506 --> 00:05:44,309
SOME OF THE MAJOR RETAILERS
IS NORDSTROM'S.

00:05:44,309 --> 00:05:45,443
THEY'RE GONNA BE ROLLING US OUT
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

00:05:45,443 --> 00:05:48,413
I'M GUESSING THAT YOU HAVE
A PATENT PENDING ON THIS.

00:05:48,413 --> 00:05:51,149
SO, WE HAVE
OUR DESIGN PATENT PENDING

00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:52,150

00:05:57,522 --> 00:05:59,190
WHAT DO THEY COST YOU
TO MAKE?

00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,159
UH, THEY COST $3.66
CURRENTLY.

00:06:01,159 --> 00:06:05,297

00:06:09,267 --> 00:06:12,203
NEXT YEAR, WE ARE ESTIMATED
TO DO $2.4 MILLION.

00:06:12,203 --> 00:06:14,406
O'Leary:
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.
YES.

00:06:14,406 --> 00:06:16,408
20 BUCKS FOR A SPONGE...

00:06:16,408 --> 00:06:18,076
YEAH.

00:06:18,076 --> 00:06:19,311
...IS A LOT OF MONEY...
I AGREE.

00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:21,446
...'CAUSE EVERY OTHER PLUSH TOY
IN THE STORE

IS $4.99, $5.99.

00:06:24,516 --> 00:06:27,185

PLUSH TOY...

00:06:27,185 --> 00:06:30,188
YES.
...LIKE, THE FIRST IN MY LIFE
I'VE EVER SEEN FOR $20.

00:06:31,323 --> 00:06:33,191
I THINK YOU GUYS GOT
A NICE BUSINESS.

00:06:33,191 --> 00:06:34,359
YOU'RE KILLING IT
ON MARGINS.

00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:36,461
BUT IT'S NOT A BUSINESS
THAT GETS ME LATHERED UP.

00:06:36,461 --> 00:06:38,463
UM, I DON'T KNOW
THAT I COULD HELP,

00:06:38,463 --> 00:06:40,498
SO FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
[GROANS]

00:06:40,498 --> 00:06:42,367
Herjavec:
OH, GOSH.

00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:46,271
THE -- THE WHOLE THOUGHT
OF MARK LATHERED UP JUST -- UGH.

00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,173

PEOPLE WOULD PAY FOR THAT.

00:06:49,474 --> 00:06:51,276
Greiner:
I HAVE A QUESTION.

00:06:51,276 --> 00:06:52,410
INSTEAD OF GOING OUT THERE
WITH NORDSTROM

00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,412
AND PUTTING IT OUT
AT $19.99,

00:06:54,412 --> 00:06:57,248
CAN YOU GO BACK
TO YOUR MANUFACTURERS

00:06:57,248 --> 00:06:59,451
AND SEE IF THERE'S ANY WAY
YOU CAN GET THE PRICE DOWN

00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:01,319
AND THEN NOT TAKE
SUCH A HEFTY MARGIN?

00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,554
YOU HAVE
A REALLY HEFTY MARGIN.

00:07:02,554 --> 00:07:05,056
RAY, LORI DOES HAVE
A VALID POINT.

00:07:05,056 --> 00:07:07,292
WHAT IS THE LOWEST
YOU CAN MAKE IT AT?

00:07:07,292 --> 00:07:08,326
TWO --
WE CAN GET IT DOWN TO --

00:07:08,326 --> 00:07:10,061
WE THINK WE CAN GET IT DOWN
TO $2.50, $2.70.

00:07:10,061 --> 00:07:12,130
FOR YOU TO GET IT DOWN
TO $2.50,

00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,499
WHAT IS THE QUANTITY
YOU HAVE TO BUY IN?

00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:17,268
600,000 UNITS OR MORE.

00:07:17,268 --> 00:07:18,303
WOW.

00:07:19,471 --> 00:07:22,207
O'Leary: GUYS,
THE PRICE IS TOO HIGH.

00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:25,210
I CAN'T EVEN SEE THIS EVER
LONG-TERM MORE THAN $12.99,

00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,211
EVER.

00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:27,512
IT SHOULD BE $9.99.

00:07:27,512 --> 00:07:29,447
AND YOU'RE NOT WORTH
$2.6 MILLION.

00:07:29,447 --> 00:07:31,182
I'M OUT.

00:07:33,318 --> 00:07:36,121
I THINK WHAT YOU'VE PROVEN IS,
YOU HAVE A GREAT CONCEPT.

00:07:36,121 --> 00:07:38,490
BUT AT A $2.6 MILLION
VALUE,

00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,359
FOR ME TODAY
TO GIVE YOU $260,000,

00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:43,461
I DON'T THINK
YOU'VE QUITE PROVEN

00:07:43,461 --> 00:07:45,330
THAT MY MONEY
WANTS TO GO THERE.

00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,498
I'M AFRAID
I'LL TAKE A BATH.

00:07:46,498 --> 00:07:48,233
THANK YOU.

00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:49,367
I'M OUT.

00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:53,338
SO, GUYS, WHY ARE YOU VALUING IT
AT $2.6 MILLION?

00:07:53,338 --> 00:07:56,441
UH, WE ARE ON SCHEDULE
TO HIT THE $5--

00:07:56,441 --> 00:07:59,310
JUST UNDER $600,000
BY THE END OF THE YEAR AND --

00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,413
ON SCHEDULE 'CAUSE YOU HAVE
EXISTING ORDERS

00:08:01,413 --> 00:08:02,414
THAT WILL TAKE YOU THERE?

00:08:02,414 --> 00:08:03,448
YES.
OKAY.

00:08:03,448 --> 00:08:05,050
SO, I WANT TO BE
PART OF THIS,

00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,352
BUT I CAN'T GIVE YOU A VALUATION
OF $2.6 MILLION.

00:08:07,352 --> 00:08:14,192
I'LL GIVE YOU $260,000
FOR 33%.

00:08:14,192 --> 00:08:17,162
THAT'S MY OFFER.

00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,498
UH, IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I'D LIKE TO HEAR, IF LORI --

00:08:20,498 --> 00:08:22,300
I'M FINE WITH THIS,
SO LET'S MOVE IT ALONG.

00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,135
SOMETHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

00:08:24,135 --> 00:08:26,237
I THINK IT'S REALLY
A SMART PRODUCT.

00:08:26,237 --> 00:08:27,439
GREAT JOB.

00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:29,407
REALLY CLEAR WHAT IT IS,

00:08:29,407 --> 00:08:32,310
THE NAME IS FANTASTIC --
SoapSox.

00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:35,080
THEN I HAVE THE OTHER SIDE
OF ME THAT'S SAYING,

00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,015
YOU HAVE A PATENT PENDING,

00:08:37,015 --> 00:08:38,450
BUT I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'RE GONNA GET IT.

00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:42,053
AND IN THE TIME THAT IT'LL TAKE
FOR YOU TO GET IT,

00:08:42,053 --> 00:08:43,254
IT MIGHT BE TWO YEARS,
THREE YEARS,

00:08:43,254 --> 00:08:46,524
AND SOMEONE ELSE
MAY COPY IT.

00:08:46,524 --> 00:08:49,127
IF YOU WERE AT A LOWER PRICE,
YOU COULD BLITZ THE MARKET.

00:08:50,195 --> 00:08:51,329
I'M OUT.

00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:53,198
THANK YOU.

00:08:53,198 --> 00:08:55,066
THANK YOU.

00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:57,435
SO, COULD YOU RESTATE
YOUR OFFER, DAYMOND,

00:08:57,435 --> 00:08:59,204
JUST SO
THAT WE'RE CLEAR?

00:08:59,204 --> 00:09:06,044
YEAH, MY OFFER IS $260,000
FOR 33%,

00:09:06,044 --> 00:09:12,417
TO MAKE US EQUAL PARTNERS,
THE THREE MUSKETEERS.

00:09:14,385 --> 00:09:16,321
WE DON'T MIND
DOING THE HARD WORK.

00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:22,093
THAT PERCENTAGE IS HIGHER THAN
WHAT WE'D WANT TO GIVE AWAY.

00:09:22,093 --> 00:09:25,296
I WOULD LIKE TO...COUNTE--

00:09:25,296 --> 00:09:26,397
DON'T MAKE A MISTAKE.

00:09:26,397 --> 00:09:28,500
JUST IN CASE --

00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,335
JUST THINK ABOUT THIS,
ALL RIGHT?

00:09:30,335 --> 00:09:32,270
IF YOU'RE WRONG
ON THE PRICING --

00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:36,174
IN OTHER WORDS, IF THE MARKET
THAT REALLY CLEARS IS $9.99,

00:09:36,174 --> 00:09:37,175
WHICH I THINK IT IS,

00:09:37,175 --> 00:09:38,376
YOU'RE REALLY GONNA NEED
THIS GUY

00:09:38,376 --> 00:09:40,478
BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA GO OUT
WITH A MISSTEPPED LAUNCH,

00:09:40,478 --> 00:09:43,314
THE FIRST RETAILERS
THAT YOU PUT THE SKUs INTO

00:09:43,314 --> 00:09:45,216
ARE GONNA HAVE SLOW SALES
AND DELIST YOU,

00:09:45,216 --> 00:09:47,285
AND THEN
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO RETRACE

00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:49,354
AND FIGURE OUT HOW
TO GET THE MANUFACTURING COST

00:09:49,354 --> 00:09:50,488
DOWN TO ABOUT A BUCK 35.

00:09:50,488 --> 00:09:53,191
ON YOUR OWN,
THAT'S GONNA BE HARD,

00:09:53,191 --> 00:09:55,093
AND SO IF HE'S WILLING TO DO IT,

00:09:55,093 --> 00:09:57,395
I MEAN, IF YOU WALK OUT OF HERE
WITHOUT THAT DEAL,

00:09:57,395 --> 00:09:58,429
YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE.

00:10:08,373 --> 00:10:10,375
Narrator:
FOUR SHARKS ARE OUT.

00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:13,444
ALVIN AND RAY
ARE SEEKING $260,000

00:10:13,444 --> 00:10:18,216
FOR 10% OF THEIR CHILDREN'S
BATH TOY COMPANY, SoapSox.

00:10:18,216 --> 00:10:20,451
DAYMOND HAS OFFERED
THE AMOUNT THEY ARE SEEKING,

00:10:20,451 --> 00:10:23,488
BUT HE WANTS 33% OF THE COMPANY.

00:10:23,488 --> 00:10:25,190
IF YOU WALK OUT OF HERE
WITHOUT THAT DEAL,

00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,191
YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE.

00:10:27,425 --> 00:10:29,227
SUCK IT UP, TAKE THE PAIN.

00:10:29,227 --> 00:10:31,229
YOU ASKED FOR TOO MUCH
IN THE FIRST PLACE.
[CUBAN CHUCKLES]

00:10:31,229 --> 00:10:32,463
ALL RIGHT?
YOU ASKED FOR TOO MUCH.

00:10:32,463 --> 00:10:34,465
YOU WANTED $260,000, AND THOSE
ARE THE RULES OF "SHARK TANK" --

00:10:34,465 --> 00:10:36,067
HE'S GOT TO GIVE YOU $260,000.

00:10:36,067 --> 00:10:37,268
YOU'VE GOT TO PAY
FOR THAT MISTAKE.

00:10:37,268 --> 00:10:38,369
YOU'RE PAYING FOR IT RIGHT NOW.

00:10:41,206 --> 00:10:42,440
UM...

00:10:44,275 --> 00:10:48,079
TH-- THE 33% IS --
IS STEEP, UH, FOR US

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,148
AND -- AND WHAT
WE'VE BEEN DOING.

00:10:50,148 --> 00:10:51,482
WE KNOW YOU BRING
A LOT OF VALUE.

00:10:51,482 --> 00:10:53,184
UH, YOU WERE
ONE OF THE SHARKS

00:10:53,184 --> 00:10:55,286
THAT WE WERE HOPING TO BE ABLE
TO GET A DEAL WITH,

00:10:55,286 --> 00:10:57,188
AND I'M HOPING WE CAN STILL
COME TO AGREEMENT

00:10:57,188 --> 00:10:58,323
ON WHERE THAT NUMBER
REALLY LIES.

00:10:58,323 --> 00:11:07,298
UM, WOULD YOU BE WILLING
TO DO...15%...FOR...

00:11:13,271 --> 00:11:14,472
...$350,000?

00:11:16,474 --> 00:11:18,176
OOH,
THEY ARE PROUD.

00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:19,210
WOW.
THEY ARE PROUD.

00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,345
MM-HMM.

00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:22,280
I SHOULD WASH HIS MOUTH OUT
WITH SOAP

00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,448
FOR THAT COUNTER.

00:11:23,448 --> 00:11:25,250
HOLD ON.

00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,185
YEAH. SO, GUYS...

00:11:28,553 --> 00:11:32,056
...I'M GONNA HAVE TO STAY FIRM
ON THE 33%.

00:11:32,056 --> 00:11:33,391
Greiner:
I HAVE A QUESTION.
YES.

00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:35,226
Herjavec:
LORI AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING.

00:11:35,226 --> 00:11:38,162
WHAT IF WE OFFERED YOU
$1 MILLION TO JUST BUY IT OUT?

00:11:38,162 --> 00:11:40,265
WE [CHUCKLES]

00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:45,270
WE AREN'T AFRAID
OF THE HARD WORK

00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,171
AND BUILDING IT
TO SOMETHING BIGGER.

00:11:47,171 --> 00:11:49,073
Uy: FOR US,
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY.

00:11:49,073 --> 00:11:52,143
I'VE BEEN DESIGNING PRODUCTS
FOR BIGGER COMPANIES.

00:11:52,143 --> 00:11:53,444
I-I KNOW I'M GOOD.

00:11:53,444 --> 00:11:55,513
BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
WHERE I FEEL LIKE,

00:11:55,513 --> 00:11:57,482
"YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M FINALLY
DOING SOMETHING FOR MYSELF."

00:11:57,482 --> 00:11:58,516
YEAH.
WE OWN THIS.

00:11:58,516 --> 00:12:00,351
WE'RE DREAM CHASERS
RIGHT NOW,

00:12:00,351 --> 00:12:01,419
SO WE DON'T WANT
TO GIVE IT AWAY.

00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:03,288
WE WANT A PARTNERSHIP,
BUT WE'RE DREAM CHASERS.

00:12:03,288 --> 00:12:04,455
WE'RE CHASING
AFTER THE AMERICAN DREAM.
AND...YEAH.

00:12:04,455 --> 00:12:06,057
Greiner: YOU KNOW WHAT?
I GET THAT.

00:12:06,057 --> 00:12:09,460
RAY, LORI AND I SAW
A LOT OF VALUE IN THE PRODUCT,

00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,363
BUT I THINK...

00:12:12,363 --> 00:12:16,067
HER AND I SEE
A POTENTIALLY DIFFERENT PATH.

00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:19,304
SO, WE JUST THOUGHT,
WE'RE WILLING TO RISK $1 MILLION

00:12:19,304 --> 00:12:21,172
TO TRY TO TAKE IT
DOWN THE PATH.

00:12:21,172 --> 00:12:23,508
Greiner: YOU'RE INNOVATORS,
SO THIS, I DON'T THINK,

00:12:23,508 --> 00:12:26,077
IS GOING TO BE
YOUR LAST PRODUCT.
Phillips: YEAH.

00:12:26,077 --> 00:12:28,179
IT'S GOING TO BE
THE FIRST OF MANY.

00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:30,248
O'Leary: GUYS, YOU GOT --
YOU GOT TO MAKE A DECISION.

00:12:30,248 --> 00:12:32,183
YOU GOT A $1 MILLION OFFER,

00:12:32,183 --> 00:12:34,319
OR YOU CAN PARTNER
WITH DAYMOND.

00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:36,454
YOU GOT TO GIVE UP
A THIRD OF THE COMPANY.

00:12:36,454 --> 00:12:39,057
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

00:12:44,128 --> 00:12:46,130
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DECLINE
BOTH OFFERS.

00:12:49,133 --> 00:12:50,234
THANK YOU.
APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU, GUYS.

00:12:50,234 --> 00:12:51,436
John: GOODBYE.
GOODBYE.
Greiner: GOOD LUCK.

00:12:51,436 --> 00:12:52,470
Phillips: THANK YOU.
GOOD LUCK.

00:12:54,372 --> 00:12:55,406
LITTLE DISAPPOINTED

00:12:55,406 --> 00:12:58,142
THAT THEY DEVALUATED OUR PRODUCT
THAT MUCH.

00:12:58,142 --> 00:13:01,145
Phillips: I DON'T THINK EVEN
IF THEY'D OFFERED US $5 MILLION

00:13:01,145 --> 00:13:03,147
THAT WE WOULD HAVE TAKEN IT,
OR $10 MILLION,

00:13:03,147 --> 00:13:04,515
BECAUSE IT'S SO MUCH MORE
THAN THAT.

00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,123
Narrator:
IN SEASON 3, FLEETWOOD HICKS

00:13:12,123 --> 00:13:13,324
MADE A DEAL
WITH MARK AND BARBARA

00:13:13,324 --> 00:13:16,194
FOR HIS CUSTOM BICYCLE COMPANY,
VILLY CUSTOMS.

00:13:16,194 --> 00:13:18,329
I THINK YOU GUYS GOT
AN INCREDIBLE DEAL.

00:13:18,329 --> 00:13:19,497
THAT'S THE ONLY KIND
OF DEALS WE DO.
Corcoran: AND A FUN DEAL,
AS WELL.

00:13:19,497 --> 00:13:20,531
WOW.

00:13:20,531 --> 00:13:22,300
Narrator:
LET'S SEE WHAT HE'S UP TO NOW.

00:13:23,267 --> 00:13:25,370
Hicks: LET'S WHIP IT INTO SHAPE,
MAN. WE GOT A LOT TO DO.

00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:26,504
COME ON, DeVILLE.

00:13:26,504 --> 00:13:28,306
BEING ON "SHARK TANK"

00:13:28,306 --> 00:13:29,440
IMMEDIATELY LEGITIMIZED
OUR BUSINESS.

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,441
GOOD JOB.

00:13:30,441 --> 00:13:31,476
BEFORE "SHARK TANK,"

00:13:31,476 --> 00:13:35,046
OUR TOTAL SALES WERE $248,000.

00:13:35,046 --> 00:13:36,280
SINCE BEING ON "SHARK TANK,"

00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,383
WE HAVE 10,000 SQUARE FEET
OF SPACE,

00:13:38,383 --> 00:13:42,053
AND WE'RE GONNA SURPASS
$2 MILLION IN SALES.

00:13:42,053 --> 00:13:44,422
IT'S THE DETAILS, MAN.
IT'S THE DETAILS. YOU KNOW THAT.

00:13:44,422 --> 00:13:47,358
WE'VE REALLY BEEN FOCUSING
ON OUR CORPORATE BIKE PROGRAM.

00:13:47,358 --> 00:13:49,293
WE'VE BEEN WORKING
WITH SOME HUGE BRANDS --

00:13:49,293 --> 00:13:51,462
PepsiCo, MONSTER ENERGY.

00:13:51,462 --> 00:13:54,265
WE'VE ALSO MADE BIKES
FOR THE BAND OneRepublic

00:13:54,265 --> 00:13:56,367
AND EVEN STEVEN TYLER
OF AEROSMITH.

00:13:56,367 --> 00:13:58,035
OO-HOO!

00:13:58,035 --> 00:13:59,303
OH, HEY, BARB.
HOW YOU DOING?

00:13:59,303 --> 00:14:00,405
GOOD. I'M IN DALLAS
FOR A MEETING.

00:14:00,405 --> 00:14:01,506
I HAD TO STOP BY.
AH.

00:14:01,506 --> 00:14:03,174
WORKING WITH BARBARA AND MARK

00:14:03,174 --> 00:14:05,076
HAS BEEN AN AWESOME EXPERIENCE.

00:14:05,076 --> 00:14:06,411
BARBARA'S A MARKETING EXPERT,

00:14:06,411 --> 00:14:08,346
AND SHE'S AN INCREDIBLE
ROLE MODEL.

00:14:08,346 --> 00:14:09,347
WOW.

00:14:09,347 --> 00:14:10,481
THIS HAS
YOUR NAME ON IT, BARB.

00:14:10,481 --> 00:14:14,085
I AM BLOWN AWAY AT WHAT
FLEETWOOD HAS BUILT HERE.

00:14:14,085 --> 00:14:16,421
LAST TIME I WAS HERE, THIS SPACE
WAS ONE THIRD THE SIZE,

00:14:16,421 --> 00:14:18,556
WE WERE DOING
1/3 THE BIKE SALES,

00:14:18,556 --> 00:14:20,291
AND THAT WAS ONLY A YEAR AGO.

00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,392
OKAY, ENOUGH OF THIS.

00:14:21,392 --> 00:14:23,294
LET'S GO ON A BIKE RIDE.
COME ON.
LET'S DO IT.

00:14:23,294 --> 00:14:25,329
Hicks: I CAN HONESTLY SAY
"SHARK TANK" HAS BEEN

00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:28,065
ONE OF THE MOST INCREDIBLE
ADVENTURES OF MY LIFE.

00:14:28,065 --> 00:14:30,368
MARK AND BARBARA SAW
THE POTENTIAL IN VILLY CUSTOMS.

00:14:30,368 --> 00:14:32,370
NOW I GET TO DO WHAT I LOVE
EVERY DAY.

00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:35,139
[ALL CHEER]

00:14:43,414 --> 00:14:45,216
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK

00:14:45,216 --> 00:14:49,554
IS A PRODUCT DESIGNED TO CARRY
ONE'S MOST VALUABLE POSSESSIONS.

00:14:55,226 --> 00:14:57,094
HELLO, SHARKS.

00:14:57,094 --> 00:14:59,096
MY NAME IS ANASTASIA BALYURA.

00:14:59,096 --> 00:15:03,468
I AM SEEKING $25,000
FOR 10% EQUITY IN MY COMPANY.

00:15:03,468 --> 00:15:08,239
MY BABY TRIXIE
LOVES TO BE HELD 24/7.

00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:11,175
TRIXIE EVEN ATTENDED LAW SCHOOL
WITH ME.

00:15:11,175 --> 00:15:14,245
IN FACT,
TRIXIE IS HERE WITH ME NOW.

00:15:16,247 --> 00:15:19,417
Herjavec: OH!
[CHUCKLES]

00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:20,418
[LAUGHS]

00:15:20,418 --> 00:15:23,221
MY BUSINESS IS HEART PUP.

00:15:23,221 --> 00:15:27,091
IT IS THE WORLD'S BEST
DOG CARRIER.

00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,094
[CHUCKLES]
[GREINER CHUCKLES]

00:15:30,094 --> 00:15:34,098
HEART PUP DOG CARRIERS
ARE UNLIKE ANY OTHER

00:15:34,098 --> 00:15:39,270
BECAUSE MINE ARE FUNCTIONAL,
FASHIONABLE, AND COMFORTABLE.

00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:42,106
MY SLINGS ARE HANDMADE

00:15:42,106 --> 00:15:44,342
OUT OF AN ITALIAN
CASHMERE-WOOL BLEND.

00:15:44,342 --> 00:15:46,344
THEY FEEL SO LUXURIOUS.

00:15:46,344 --> 00:15:48,346
THE LARGE OUTSIDE POCKET

00:15:48,346 --> 00:15:52,116
LETS YOU BRING YOUR PHONE,
WALLET, KEYS.

00:15:52,116 --> 00:15:54,285
YOU CAN ACTUALLY LEAVE
YOUR PURSE AT HOME.

00:15:54,285 --> 00:15:57,321
THE ERGONOMIC DESIGN
GOES ON BOTH SHOULDERS

00:15:57,321 --> 00:15:59,524
FOR A SUPER SNUG
AND COMFORTABLE WEAR.

00:15:59,524 --> 00:16:01,192
SO CUTE.

00:16:01,192 --> 00:16:02,460
THE CLIP ATTACHED INSIDE

00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,296
GOES ON THE PUPPY'S HARNESS
OR COLLAR

00:16:05,296 --> 00:16:08,332
SO THAT IF YOUR PUPPY'S A JUMPER

00:16:08,332 --> 00:16:11,402
OR YOU JUST WANT TO BE ABLE
TO BEND OVER, RIGHT?
[Chuckling]
"PUPPY'S A JUMPER."

00:16:11,402 --> 00:16:17,074
YOUR PUP WILL DEFINITELY
HEART THIS, RIGHT, TRIXIE?

00:16:17,074 --> 00:16:18,109
"I HEART IT."

00:16:18,109 --> 00:16:19,176
AW.

00:16:19,176 --> 00:16:21,212
AW.
THANK YOU.

00:16:21,212 --> 00:16:23,147
[CHUCKLES]
I ACTUALLY HAVE
SOME CUSTOM-MADE SAMPLES

00:16:23,147 --> 00:16:24,448
I'D LOVE TO PASS OUT TO YOU.

00:16:24,448 --> 00:16:26,117
SURE.
SURE.

00:16:26,117 --> 00:16:27,184
CAN I JUST ASK YOU --
IS TRIXIE DRUGGED?

00:16:27,184 --> 00:16:28,486
[CHUCKLES]
[CHUCKLES]

00:16:28,486 --> 00:16:30,421
SHE'S THE BEST-BEHAVED DOG.
THAT ONE'S FOR YOU.

00:16:30,421 --> 00:16:32,323
CAN I SEE HER?
OH, SURE.

00:16:32,323 --> 00:16:34,191
ANASTASIA,
I HAVE A CHIHUAHUA,
Balyura: LORI, THIS IS
GONNA LOOK AWESOME ON YOU.

00:16:34,191 --> 00:16:35,459
NOT A LONG-HAIRED ONE.
EXACT SAME COLORS.

00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:37,395
30% OF CUSTOMERS ARE MEN.

00:16:37,395 --> 00:16:38,429
YOU LOVE THIS, YEAH.
John: REALLY?

00:16:38,429 --> 00:16:40,264
IT-- IT'S MY DAUGHTERS'.

00:16:40,264 --> 00:16:42,033
LET'S JUST GET THAT STRAIGHT
RIGHT NOW.

00:16:42,033 --> 00:16:43,167
OH, GREAT, GREAT.

00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:44,402
WELL, YOUR DAUGHTER WOULD LOOK
SO AMAZING IN THIS.

00:16:44,402 --> 00:16:46,203
THANK YOU.
APPRECIATE IT.

00:16:46,203 --> 00:16:48,039
Greiner: SO, HAVE YOU
BEEN SELLING THESE?

00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:50,241
I HAVE, YES.

00:16:50,241 --> 00:16:54,145
I ACTUALLY AM A BIT
OF AN ENTREPRENEUR ON ACCIDENT

00:16:54,145 --> 00:16:58,082
[CHUCKLES] UM, BECAUSE I WAS IN
MY FINAL SEMESTER OF LAW SCHOOL,

00:16:58,082 --> 00:17:00,351
AND THOSE LAW BOOKS,
THEY'RE HUGE.

00:17:00,351 --> 00:17:03,454
SO, IT WAS KIND OF TOUGH
TO HOLD HER AND THE BOOKS.

00:17:03,454 --> 00:17:06,090
AND SHE LOVES TO BE HELD.
YOU BROUGHT TRIXIE
THROUGH AN HOUR AND A HALF?

00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:07,525
TO LAW SCHOOL.
OH, YEAH. OH, YEAH.

00:17:07,525 --> 00:17:09,393
AND TRIXIE LOVES TO BE HELD.

00:17:09,393 --> 00:17:12,063
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BE ZIPPED UP
OFF TO THE SIDE

00:17:12,063 --> 00:17:13,397
IN SOME BAG
THAT'S FALLING OFF MY SHOULDER.

00:17:13,397 --> 00:17:15,366
ARE YOU A LAWYER NOW?

00:17:15,366 --> 00:17:17,368
UM, ACTUALLY,
I STARTED THIS COMPANY

00:17:17,368 --> 00:17:19,136
MY LAST SEMESTER OF LAW SCHOOL,

00:17:19,136 --> 00:17:21,172
AND WHEN I INVENTED THIS,

00:17:21,172 --> 00:17:23,107
I STARTED BRINGING HER
TO LAW SCHOOL LIKE THIS.

00:17:23,107 --> 00:17:25,042
AND MY PATENT LAW PROFESSOR
SAID,

00:17:25,042 --> 00:17:27,378
"THE LAWS ARE CHANGING
AT THE END OF THIS MONTH,

00:17:27,378 --> 00:17:30,314
"SO IF YOU POST THIS ONLINE
RIGHT NOW,

00:17:30,314 --> 00:17:32,450
YOU'LL ACTUALLY HAVE
COMMON-LAW PATENT PROTECTION."

00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,051
YEAH, SO HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN SELLING IT,

00:17:34,051 --> 00:17:35,186
AND HOW MANY HAVE YOU SOLD
THIS YEAR?

00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:38,389
YEAH, UM, SO I STARTED, UH,
IN JULY OF 2013,

00:17:38,389 --> 00:17:40,391
SO I'VE BEEN
FOR ALMOST A YEAR NOW.

00:17:40,391 --> 00:17:45,329
AND, UH, I HAVE SOLD, UH,
ABOUT 980 UNITS, UH --

00:17:45,329 --> 00:17:46,464
AT WHAT PRICE?

00:17:46,464 --> 00:17:48,265
UH, THEY'RE $138 EACH.

00:17:48,265 --> 00:17:50,334
WHAT?!
$138 EACH?

00:17:50,334 --> 00:17:53,104
YEAH, BECAUSE
THEY'RE A FASHION ACCESSORY.

00:17:53,104 --> 00:17:55,172
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE IT, ANASTASIA?

00:17:55,172 --> 00:17:58,242
UM, $8 FOR FABRIC
AND THEN $8 FOR PRODUCTION.

00:17:58,242 --> 00:17:59,377
[Chuckling] WOW.

00:17:59,377 --> 00:18:01,245
YOUR MARGINS ARE CRAZY.
[JOHN CHUCKLES]

00:18:01,245 --> 00:18:02,513
THOSE ARE THE BEST MARGINS
I'VE EVER HEARD.

00:18:02,513 --> 00:18:04,448
WELL, YOU KNOW --
ANASTASIA,
WHAT ARE YOUR TOTAL SALES?

00:18:04,448 --> 00:18:07,518
UH, MY TOTAL SALES ARE
$135,000.

00:18:07,518 --> 00:18:10,187
YOU'RE KILLING IT.
YOU'RE MAKING REAL MONEY.

00:18:10,187 --> 00:18:11,355
YEAH.
I MAKE A LITTLE MONEY,
YEAH.

00:18:11,355 --> 00:18:12,490
YOU'RE MAKING --
WHERE ARE YOU
SELLING THESE?

00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,392
YOU'RE MAKING
$100,000 A YEAR.

00:18:14,392 --> 00:18:16,227
YEAH, I GUESS SO.
I MEAN, OUR SALES SEEM TO
BE DOUBLING EACH YEAR.

00:18:16,227 --> 00:18:18,229
[LAUGHTER]
YOU GUESS SO?

00:18:18,229 --> 00:18:20,097
I -- YOU KNOW, FOR ME,

00:18:20,097 --> 00:18:22,033
I -- IT'S NOT EVEN
JUST ABOUT THE MONEY.

00:18:22,033 --> 00:18:23,300
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,302
YEAH, I WANT TO MAKE
A LOT OF MONEY WITH THIS,

00:18:25,302 --> 00:18:28,439
BUT MOSTLY,
I WANT TO GO OUT THERE

00:18:28,439 --> 00:18:29,507
AND REALLY, YOU KNOW,

00:18:29,507 --> 00:18:32,343
PARTNER WITH A STRATEGIC PARTNER
LIKE YOU SHARKS,

00:18:32,343 --> 00:18:34,378
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE
ALL THE ANSWERS.

00:18:34,378 --> 00:18:36,213
TO PARAPHRASE HENRY FORD,

00:18:36,213 --> 00:18:38,516
I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER
TO ANY QUESTION YOU CAN ASK ME,

00:18:38,516 --> 00:18:41,118
BUT ANY QUESTION
YOU CAN ASK ME,

00:18:41,118 --> 00:18:43,120
THERE'S A ROW OF BUTTONS
ON MY DESK,

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,255
AND I CAN PUSH ONE

00:18:44,255 --> 00:18:46,223
AND GET SOMEBODY
THAT CAN GIVE YOU THE ANSWER.

00:18:46,223 --> 00:18:48,325
AND THAT'S WHY
I NEED YOU, SHARKS.

00:18:48,325 --> 00:18:50,428
I NEED YOU TO BE
ONE OF MY BUTTONS

00:18:50,428 --> 00:18:52,229
SO THAT I'LL HAVE THE ANSWERS...
[LAUGHS]

00:18:52,229 --> 00:18:55,166
LOVE IT.
I LIKE THAT.
...SO THAT I'LL BE ABLE
TO GO FORTH AND --

00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:56,434
HOW ARE YOU SELLING THEM?

00:18:56,434 --> 00:18:58,302
FOR THE MOST PART,
IT'S THROUGH THE INTERNET

00:18:58,302 --> 00:19:00,237
AND JUST WORD OF MOUTH,
BECAUSE --
HOLD ON FOR A SECOND.

00:19:00,237 --> 00:19:02,373
ANASTASIA, CAN I SEE THE DOG?
CAN I SEE THE DOG?
YEAH.

00:19:02,373 --> 00:19:04,241
O'Leary: I JUST WANT TO SAY
THAT I'VE NEVER SEEN

00:19:04,241 --> 00:19:07,111
ANYBODY MORE RELAXED
IN THE SHARK TANK THAN TRIXIE.

00:19:07,111 --> 00:19:08,145
[CHUCKLES]
[LAUGHS]

00:19:08,145 --> 00:19:09,513
VERY LAID-BACK.

00:19:09,513 --> 00:19:11,082
SHE IS --

00:19:11,082 --> 00:19:12,483
OBVIOUSLY, YOU BORED HER
TO DEATH IN LAW SCHOOL.

00:19:12,483 --> 00:19:14,385
SHE'S WELL TRAINED.
ANASTASIA,
YOU'RE MAKING THIS YOURSELF?

00:19:14,385 --> 00:19:15,486
YES, I AM.

00:19:15,486 --> 00:19:18,289
AND SO I'M SURE
THEY'RE NOT PERFECTION, DAYMOND.

00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:19,457
NO, I CAN --
I CAN GET OV--
I -- I'M NOT A SEAMSTRESS.

00:19:19,457 --> 00:19:21,058
I MEAN, THE SEWING, YES,
YOU CAN TELL

00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:22,359
THAT IT'S NOT
A-A COMMERCIAL NEEDLE,

00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:24,161
BUT THE FABRIC'S
REALLY NICE.
YEAH.

00:19:24,161 --> 00:19:26,530
WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO USE
THE $25,000 FOR?

00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,232
THE FIRST
AND MOST IMPORTANT THING

00:19:28,232 --> 00:19:29,300
THAT I WILL DO NO MATTER WHAT

00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,303
IS GET THE PRODUCTION
OFF MY PLATE

00:19:32,303 --> 00:19:34,371
SO I CAN FOCUS
ON RUNNING THE BUSINESS.

00:19:34,371 --> 00:19:37,274
UM, SO I WILL GET A FACTORY
TO MAKE THESE.

00:19:37,274 --> 00:19:40,277
I'M ACTUALLY STILL
HANDMAKING THESE AT THIS POINT.

00:19:40,277 --> 00:19:41,378
Herjavec:
I LOVE ANIMALS.

00:19:41,378 --> 00:19:43,180
I MEAN, AS YOU CAN TELL,
I LOVE ANIMALS.

00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,315
YEAH, I KNOW THAT ABOUT YOU.
IT'S GREAT.

00:19:44,315 --> 00:19:48,185
AND, UH, YOU KNOW, ONE
OF THE THINGS I-I'VE LEARNED

00:19:48,185 --> 00:19:50,087
OVER SIX SEASONS
OF "SHARK TANK" IS

00:19:50,087 --> 00:19:52,156
YOU GOT TO GET IN
ON THE RIGHT DEALS,

00:19:52,156 --> 00:19:54,325
BUT SOMETIMES, YOU MAY NOT BE
THE RIGHT PARTNER.

00:19:54,325 --> 00:19:56,160
SO, I DON'T SEE THIS

00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,461
AS A WIDE BUSINESS
OR A FASHION ACCESSORY.

00:19:57,461 --> 00:20:00,131
WELL, THEY'RE SELLING
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

00:20:00,131 --> 00:20:01,465
I DON'T SHARE
IN YOUR VISION,

00:20:01,465 --> 00:20:03,234
WHICH IS OKAY.
THAT'S OKAY.

00:20:03,234 --> 00:20:04,301
YOU'RE MAKING
$100,000 A YEAR.
SURE.

00:20:04,301 --> 00:20:05,436
POWER TO YOU.
KEEP GOING.
YEAH.

00:20:05,436 --> 00:20:09,173
AS AN INVESTOR, THOUGH,
I'M OUT.

00:20:10,407 --> 00:20:12,276
THANK YOU.

00:20:12,276 --> 00:20:14,378
Cuban:
ANASTASIA, I TOTALLY SEE

00:20:14,378 --> 00:20:16,247
HOW THIS COULD BE AN AMAZING
BUSINESS, ALL RIGHT, BUT --

00:20:16,247 --> 00:20:19,083
YES, WITH HUGE MARGINS.

00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,151
WITH HUGE MARGINS.

00:20:20,151 --> 00:20:22,119
WITH FORWARD THINKING,
WITH SETTING A TREND.

00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:24,088
BUT IT WOULD
DRIVE ME CRAZY...
[CHUCKLES]

00:20:24,088 --> 00:20:25,289
...JUST TRYING TO DEAL
WITH ALL OF IT.

00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:26,290
IT REALLY WOULD.
BUT --

00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,325
BUT WHAT WOULD YOU
BE DEALING WITH?

00:20:28,325 --> 00:20:29,560
JUST LIKE YOU SAID,

00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,428
YOU NEED A PARTNER
TO BE A BUTTON, RIGHT?

00:20:31,428 --> 00:20:34,198
I DON'T MAKE A GOOD BUTTON.
I'M NOT BUTTON MATERIAL.

00:20:34,198 --> 00:20:36,167
YOU KNOW, MAYBE
I DIDN'T SAY THAT RIGHT...
[CHUCKLES]

00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:38,135
...BECAUSE ALL I NEED
IS A PARTNER

00:20:38,135 --> 00:20:41,138
THAT CAN EITHER PUT ME
IN TOUCH WITH SOMETHING

00:20:41,138 --> 00:20:42,273
OR TELL ME, "HERE'S --"

00:20:42,273 --> 00:20:44,175
I WOULD GO NUTS, TRIXIE.
THAT'S -- I MEAN ANASTASIA.

00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:48,412
[LAUGHTER]
NO, MARK. MARK. MARK, NO.

00:20:48,412 --> 00:20:50,381
ACTUALLY, MARK, WHAT I WOULD BE
TALKING TO YOU ABOUT IS TH--

00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:53,284
ME AND THE BUTTON ARE NOT ONE,
SO I'VE -- I'VE GOT TO GO OUT.

00:20:53,284 --> 00:20:56,187
OKAY, MARK, CAN I ASK
WHY SPECIFICALLY

00:20:56,187 --> 00:20:58,355
OR WHAT SPECIFICALLY YOU THINK
MIGHT BE A CONCERN?

00:20:58,355 --> 00:21:00,424
MAN, ANASTASIA,
YOU CAN TALK.
MAYBE I CAN ADDRESS IT.

00:21:00,424 --> 00:21:02,293
[CHUCKLES]
BRUTALLY HONEST,
I'D GO NUTS.

00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:05,229
OKAY, MARK,
JUST TO ADDRESS YOUR POINTS --

00:21:05,229 --> 00:21:06,430
GO THAT WAY. DO-- DON'T. PLEASE,
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE.

00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,165
CAN I JUST RESPOND, THOUGH,
TO YOUR POINTS VERY BRIEFLY?

00:21:08,165 --> 00:21:10,134
[LAUGHTER]
NO.
NO, YOU'RE -- SEE?

00:21:10,134 --> 00:21:11,402
ANASTASIA, HE'S OUT.
DO YOU SEE
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

00:21:11,402 --> 00:21:13,037
YOU GOT TO GO ON.
DO YOU SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING
HERE, ANASTASIA?

00:21:13,037 --> 00:21:14,071
ANASTASIA,
YOU STILL HAVE THREE SHARKS

00:21:14,071 --> 00:21:15,172
THAT ARE
POTENTIAL INVESTORS.

00:21:15,172 --> 00:21:16,407
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.
YEAH.
GO AFTER LORI.

00:21:18,075 --> 00:21:19,476
[CHUCKLES]
SHE'S DYING
TO COME BACK.

00:21:19,476 --> 00:21:21,245
I'M WILLING TO TALK
TO THE OTHER SHARKS --

00:21:21,245 --> 00:21:22,213
MORE THAN HAPPY TO.

00:21:22,213 --> 00:21:26,050
SO, LORI...
LORI.

00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,284
...LET'S MAKE A DEAL.

00:21:27,284 --> 00:21:30,187
YOU KNOW, UM, I THINK
THAT YOU SOLD QUITE A LOT

00:21:30,187 --> 00:21:31,355
IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME

00:21:31,355 --> 00:21:34,124
OF SOMETHING THAT'S VERY NICHE
AND UNUSUAL, YOU KNOW?

00:21:34,124 --> 00:21:35,125
YEAH.

00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,393
MY FEAR IS
IS THAT IT'S SOMETHING

00:21:36,393 --> 00:21:39,363
THAT'S EASY FOR PEOPLE
TO REPLICATE QUICKLY.

00:21:39,363 --> 00:21:44,068
I LIKE THINGS THAT ARE UNIQUE,
THAT HAVE BROAD MASS APPEAL.

00:21:44,068 --> 00:21:46,070
YEAH.
THIS IS RATHER NICHE.

00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:48,172
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.

00:21:49,473 --> 00:21:51,442
UM, LORI,
I ACTUALLY HAVE --

00:21:51,442 --> 00:21:54,278
OKAY, ANASTASIA,
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $25K FOR 50%,

00:21:54,278 --> 00:21:55,346
BUT THE DOG BITES IT.

00:21:55,346 --> 00:21:56,347
[LAUGHS]

00:21:56,347 --> 00:21:58,415
[GREINER CHUCKLES]

00:21:58,415 --> 00:21:59,483
I HATE RAT DOGS A LOT.

00:21:59,483 --> 00:22:01,285
I JUST HATE THEM.
I DON'T GET IT.

00:22:01,285 --> 00:22:03,087
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY ANYBODY
WOULD WANT A RAT AS A PET.

00:22:03,087 --> 00:22:05,122
HOW CAN YOU NOT
GET THIS?
I'M OUT.

00:22:05,122 --> 00:22:07,057
THANK YOU.

00:22:07,057 --> 00:22:08,392
COME ON, DAYMOND.

00:22:08,392 --> 00:22:09,560
John: WELL, I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR THIS MOMENT,

00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,462
NOW THAT WE'VE GOT ALL THE
JOKERS OUT OF THE DECK HERE.

00:22:11,462 --> 00:22:13,464
[CHUCKLES]

00:22:13,464 --> 00:22:15,132
UM, I WOULD HAVE NEVER EXPECTED
TO GET EDUCATED

00:22:15,132 --> 00:22:18,168
IN THE PET DEPARTMENT
IN THE LAST YEAR.

00:22:18,168 --> 00:22:23,307
MY DIRECTOR OF LICENSING
JUST RUNS IN MY OFFICE AND SAYS,

00:22:23,307 --> 00:22:26,410
"WE'RE REPRESENTING TARA THE CAT
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT."

00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,479
AND I GO ON YOUTUBE,
I SEE TARA THE CAT.

00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:32,516
SHE GOES AND SAVES A CHILD
FROM BEING MAULED BY A DOG.

00:22:32,516 --> 00:22:34,218
I SAW THAT.
IT'S INCREDIBLE.
RIGHT?

00:22:34,218 --> 00:22:36,253
SO, I'VE GOTTEN
A QUICK EDUCATION IN THIS AREA,

00:22:36,253 --> 00:22:37,421
AND THERE'S MONEY
TO BE MADE.

00:22:37,421 --> 00:22:38,455
ABSOLUTELY.

00:22:38,455 --> 00:22:40,157
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER.

00:22:40,157 --> 00:22:41,558
REALLY?

00:22:41,558 --> 00:22:43,394
GREAT.

00:22:43,394 --> 00:22:45,496
I'LL GIVE YOU $50,000
FOR 40%.

00:22:47,431 --> 00:22:49,233
[CHUCKLES]
THAT'S SICK.

00:22:49,233 --> 00:22:50,501
[CHUCKLES]

00:22:58,175 --> 00:23:00,177
DAYMOND, YOU GOT A DEAL.

00:23:00,177 --> 00:23:02,079
WOW.
WOW.
WOW.
WOW.

00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:03,247
EASY BREEZY. THAT'S BEING
PRECISE. I LIKE THAT.

00:23:03,247 --> 00:23:05,115
SHORT AND SWEET.
THANK YOU.
HECK, YEAH.
THANK YOU.

00:23:05,115 --> 00:23:06,216
I APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU.

00:23:06,216 --> 00:23:08,319
CONGRATS.
Herjavec:
WAY TO GO, TRIXIE.

00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:09,353
CONGRATULATIONS,
ANASTASIA.

00:23:09,353 --> 00:23:10,387
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:23:10,387 --> 00:23:12,189
OH, YEAH,
I FORGOT THE DOG.
YEAH.

00:23:12,189 --> 00:23:14,091
THANK YOU.
CONGRATS. BYE.
SEE YA.

00:23:14,091 --> 00:23:15,326
I'LL GIVE YOU 50 BUCKS
FOR TRIXIE.

00:23:15,326 --> 00:23:16,427
[CHUCKLES]

00:23:16,427 --> 00:23:19,129
YAY! WE GOT A DEAL!

00:23:19,129 --> 00:23:20,497
TRIXIE, YOU EXCITED?

00:23:20,497 --> 00:23:22,399
WE GET TO GO WORK.
GO TO WORK!

00:23:22,399 --> 00:23:26,370
I KNOW I'M AN INNOVATOR,
AND IT'S A LITTLE SAD

00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:28,105
THAT THE OTHER SHARKS
DIDN'T GET IT.

00:23:28,105 --> 00:23:30,040
BUT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S OKAY.

00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,408
I FEEL LIKE OFTENTIMES,

00:23:31,408 --> 00:23:34,278
I AM A LITTLE BIT LIKE
EINSTEIN'S FAMOUS QUOTE

00:23:34,278 --> 00:23:37,081
WHERE HE HAS TO ALWAYS ASK
HIMSELF, "AM I INSANE,

00:23:37,081 --> 00:23:38,248
OR IS THE REST OF THE WORLD?"

NEXT UP ARE ENTREPRENEURS

00:23:48,459 --> 00:23:52,196
WHO BELIEVE THEY HAVE THE NEXT
BIG HIT IN THE TOY INDUSTRY.

00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,234
[CHUCKLES]

00:23:59,136 --> 00:24:00,504
[CHUCKLES]

00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:04,141
OOH.

00:24:10,114 --> 00:24:11,415
HELLO, SHARKS.
HELLO, SHARKS.

00:24:11,415 --> 00:24:15,219
MY NAME IS DUSTIN,
A.K.A. "THE RED DRAGON."

00:24:15,219 --> 00:24:17,121
AND I'M KEN.
THEY CALL ME "THE BUTCHER."

00:24:17,121 --> 00:24:19,323
WE'RE HERE
LOOKING FOR $60,000

00:24:19,323 --> 00:24:22,159
IN EXCHANGE FOR
30% OF OUR COMPANY.

00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,129
SINCE THE BEGINNING
OF THE 15th CENTURY,

00:24:25,129 --> 00:24:26,397
MANKIND
HAS BEEN FASCINATED

00:24:26,397 --> 00:24:28,499
BY THE MYSTERIOUS WAYS
OF THE NINJA.

00:24:28,499 --> 00:24:31,235
HA!
A NINJA IS CUNNING.
A NINJA IS WISE.

00:24:31,235 --> 00:24:34,171
A NINJA CAN ADAPT TO THEIR
SURROUNDINGS SEAMLESSLY,

00:24:34,171 --> 00:24:36,073
OFTEN MAKING THEMSELVES
INVISIBLE TO THEIR ENEMIES.

00:24:36,073 --> 00:24:37,441
NINJAS FOLLOW
A MORAL CODE

00:24:37,441 --> 00:24:40,110
REGARDING DIGNITY, HONOR,
AND RESPECT.

00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:42,146
[CHUCKLES]
IT IS FOR THESE REASONS

00:24:42,146 --> 00:24:44,148
THAT EVERYONE WANTS
TO BE A NINJA,

00:24:44,148 --> 00:24:46,283
AND NOW,
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER,

00:24:46,283 --> 00:24:49,186
WE CAN ALL FINALLY BE NINJAS
IN OUR OWN RIGHT.

00:24:49,186 --> 00:24:50,521
INTRODUCING...

00:24:50,521 --> 00:24:52,423
NINJA CARDS!

00:24:58,162 --> 00:24:59,363
Herjavec: NO.
Greiner: PRETTY COOL.

00:24:59,363 --> 00:25:03,400
OH, MY GOSH.
THAT IS SO COOL.

00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,235
THAT IS GREAT.

00:25:05,235 --> 00:25:08,038
ESSENTIALLY, OUR GAME
IS LIKE DARTS BUT WITH CARDS.

00:25:08,038 --> 00:25:11,475
YOU CAN PLAY GAMES LIKE
AROUND THE WORLD, HORSE, 21.

00:25:11,475 --> 00:25:13,477
YOU CAN EVEN MAKE UP
YOUR OWN GAMES.

00:25:13,477 --> 00:25:15,479
THE POSSIBILITIES
ARE ENDLESS.

00:25:15,479 --> 00:25:19,183
BUT TO TRULY UNDERSTAND
AND APPRECIATE THIS GAME,

00:25:19,183 --> 00:25:20,417
YOU HAVE TO PLAY IT.

00:25:20,417 --> 00:25:23,187
SO, AT THIS POINT,
WE'D LIKE TO INVITE TWO SHARKS

00:25:23,187 --> 00:25:25,456
TO COMPETE
IN A NINJA CARD BATTLE.

00:25:25,456 --> 00:25:27,324
OH! OH! OH! OH!
IT'S GOT TO BE ME.
IT'S GOT TO BE ME.

00:25:27,324 --> 00:25:29,259
[ALL TALKING EXCITEDLY]

00:25:29,259 --> 00:25:30,394
STEP RIGHT UP!
COME ON, GUYS.

00:25:30,394 --> 00:25:31,528
YOU'RE GONNA WIN A PRIZE
PLAYING SOME NINJA CARDS.

00:25:31,528 --> 00:25:33,363
ALL RIGHT.

00:25:33,363 --> 00:25:35,132
THE BUTCHER'S GONNA SHOW YOU
SOME TECHNIQUES.

00:25:35,132 --> 00:25:36,300
Haton:
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
O'Leary: OKAY.

00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,135
SO, THE FIRST TECHNIQUE
IS THE FRISBEE THROW.

00:25:38,135 --> 00:25:40,170
VERY SIMPLE.
GO LIKE THAT.
GO FOR US.

00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,405
SECOND THROW,
LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT,

00:25:41,405 --> 00:25:42,406
IS THE TOMAHAWK.

00:25:42,406 --> 00:25:44,274
SAME HOLD
AS THE FRISBEE THROW

00:25:44,274 --> 00:25:45,309
ONLY YOU'RE GOING
VERTICAL MOTION.

00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:46,410
GOT IT.

00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:48,278
THE HARDEST TO MASTER,
BUT MY PERSONAL FAVORITE,

00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:50,481
IS THE SIDEWINDER,
JUST LIKE THIS.

00:25:52,082 --> 00:25:53,417
Berk:
AS AN ADDED INCENTIVE TODAY,

00:25:53,417 --> 00:25:54,485
WE MADE A SPECIAL BOARD
FOR YOU GUYS.

00:25:54,485 --> 00:25:56,153
OKAY.
LET'S CHECK IT OUT.

00:25:57,254 --> 00:25:59,323
READY?

00:25:59,323 --> 00:26:01,358

00:26:01,358 --> 00:26:03,494
Berk: OKAY.
Herjavec: KEVIN.

00:26:03,494 --> 00:26:05,429
NOW, THE GAME IS, WHOEVER HITS
THE MOST SHARKS WINS.

00:26:05,429 --> 00:26:07,397
[LAUGHS]

00:26:07,397 --> 00:26:09,266
Haton: THERE IT IS.
Berk: ONE.
WHOO!

00:26:09,266 --> 00:26:11,034
YOU DIDN'T HIT --
YOU GOT TO HIT A --
YOU GOT TO FLING IT.
YOU GOT TO FLING IT.

00:26:11,034 --> 00:26:12,136
OH!
OH, DOES THAT COUNT?

00:26:12,136 --> 00:26:14,071
YEAH,
THAT DIDN'T GET ME.
I THINK THAT COUNTS.

00:26:14,071 --> 00:26:15,105
Berk: ANYWHERE
ON THE SHARK COUNTS.

00:26:15,105 --> 00:26:16,140
FLING IT. FLING IT.

00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,174
YOU GOT TO FLING IT
IN THERE. OH!

00:26:17,174 --> 00:26:18,375
OH, THERE IT IS.
OH, I GOT CUBAN.

00:26:18,375 --> 00:26:19,443
THERE IT IS.
WINGED. YOU WINGED ME.

00:26:19,443 --> 00:26:21,078
THAT DOESN'T COUNT.

00:26:21,078 --> 00:26:22,212
FLING IT.
YEAH, FLING IT.

00:26:22,212 --> 00:26:23,480
[GROANS]

00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,283
OOH. OH, THAT COUNTS.
THAT COUNTS.
OH.

00:26:26,283 --> 00:26:27,384
OH, THAT --

00:26:28,318 --> 00:26:29,453
THERE WE GO.

00:26:29,453 --> 00:26:30,521
FLING IT FASTER.
A LITTLE BIT FASTER.

00:26:30,521 --> 00:26:32,456
THERE YOU GO.
OH!

00:26:34,091 --> 00:26:35,259
OH!

00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:37,161
DEATH. YES.

00:26:37,161 --> 00:26:38,495
OH, WE GOT A NATURAL.

00:26:38,495 --> 00:26:40,130
OKAY, GUYS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,265
WE HAVE A CHAMPION.
Haton: THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:26:41,265 --> 00:26:44,067
Herjavec: IT IS KIND OF FUN,
I GOT TO TELL YOU.

00:26:44,067 --> 00:26:46,136
Greiner: SO, IS THAT, LIKE,
A REGULAR PLAYING CARD,

00:26:46,136 --> 00:26:47,371
OR IS THAT THICKER,
OR...?

00:26:47,371 --> 00:26:49,273
Berk: IT'S A NINJA CARD.
IT'S A SPECIAL CARD.

00:26:49,273 --> 00:26:50,407
IT'S A NINJA CARD.

00:26:50,407 --> 00:26:52,276
BUT IT IS A, UH,
THICK, PLASTIC CARD.

00:26:52,276 --> 00:26:54,311
DO YOU HAVE TO BUY, UM,

00:26:54,311 --> 00:26:56,346
A SPECIAL BOARD
IN WHICH TO USE WITH IT?

00:26:56,346 --> 00:26:58,282
THIS IS THE GAME
THAT YOU BUY AT THE STORE.

00:26:58,282 --> 00:26:59,483
OKAY. OKAY.
Herjavec: OH, I SEE.

00:26:59,483 --> 00:27:01,051
THAT'S THE PACKAGING.

00:27:01,051 --> 00:27:02,085
YEP. FOR NOW.

00:27:02,085 --> 00:27:03,387
SO, IT'S --
IT'S A THICK STYROFOAM.

00:27:03,387 --> 00:27:04,521
IT'S A THICK STYROFOAM.
CORRECT.

00:27:04,521 --> 00:27:06,557
Herjavec:
HOW MANY HAVE YOU SOLD?

00:27:06,557 --> 00:27:09,326
WE SOLD -- WE MADE 100 UNITS,
AND WE SOLD THEM ALL.

00:27:10,394 --> 00:27:11,461
A WHOLE 100 UNITS?

00:27:11,461 --> 00:27:13,297
[CHUCKLES]
A WHOLE 100 UNITS.

00:27:13,297 --> 00:27:15,399
WOW.
OVER WHAT PERIOD
OF TIME?

00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:17,167
[LAUGHTER]
OUR SALES ARE

00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:19,102
WHAT MR. WONDERFUL WOULD CALL
POO-POO.
YEAH.

00:27:19,102 --> 00:27:22,172
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE
WE LAUNCHED IN JULY 2012,

00:27:22,172 --> 00:27:25,342
AND THEN WE SIGNED
AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE AGREEMENT.

00:27:25,342 --> 00:27:26,410
YES.
John: OH!

00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,145
Cuban: TELL US MORE!

00:27:28,145 --> 00:27:30,314
GRASSHOPPER,
TELL ME MORE.
John: OH!

00:27:30,314 --> 00:27:32,516
Berk: YEAH, SO WE WENT
TO THE TOY SHOW,

00:27:32,516 --> 00:27:34,218
AND IT HAPPENED TO BE
THE CHICAGO TOY FAIR.

00:27:34,218 --> 00:27:35,352
AND WITHIN
THE FIRST HOUR,

00:27:35,352 --> 00:27:37,187
WE GOT OFFERED
A LICENSE AGREEMENT.

00:27:37,187 --> 00:27:40,357
THE DEAL WAS AN EXCLUSIVE,
SO THEY HAD THE WHOLE THING.

00:27:40,357 --> 00:27:44,428
AND IT WAS 5%,
ESCALATED 1% PER YEAR.

00:27:44,428 --> 00:27:46,430
OKAY, THIS IS ALL GOOD NEWS.
WHERE'S THE BAD NEWS?

00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,398
THAT'S THE BAD NEWS.

00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:51,034
THE BAD NEWS IS, THEY COULDN'T
SOURCE IT IN CHINA

00:27:51,034 --> 00:27:52,402
SO THEY BAILED OUT
AFTER A YEAR.
WHAT?

00:27:52,402 --> 00:27:53,437
Herjavec:
THEY COULDN'T SOURCE WHAT?

00:27:53,437 --> 00:27:55,038
HOW COULD THEY NOT
SOURCE THIS?

00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:56,240
IT'S STYROFOAM!

00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,507
IT'S NOT EXACTLY
STYROFOAM.

00:27:57,507 --> 00:27:59,109
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT IS IT?

00:27:59,109 --> 00:28:01,044
IT'S A --
IT'S A SPECIAL CRAFT FOAM.

00:28:01,044 --> 00:28:02,346
DID YOU GET OUT OF THAT?

00:28:02,346 --> 00:28:04,014

IS VERTICAL, DON'T KNOW.

00:35:27,424 --> 00:35:30,160
SOME OF THE OTHER IDEAS YOU HAD
ARE INTERESTING,

00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,196
BUT YOU HAVE
TONS OF COMPETITION.

00:35:33,196 --> 00:35:35,498
SO, WOULD I PAY
$3 MILLION FOR THIS?

00:35:35,498 --> 00:35:37,067
NO.

00:35:37,067 --> 00:35:40,103
THAT'S A HUGE STRETCH
UNTIL YOU PROVE IT TO ME.

00:35:40,103 --> 00:35:44,207
YOU KNOW, WHAT I LOVE ABOUT ME
IS, I CARE ABOUT THE CASH.

00:35:44,207 --> 00:35:46,309
CASH.
[CHUCKLES]

00:35:46,309 --> 00:35:48,111
AND I THINK YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A HARD TIME GETTING IT.

00:35:48,111 --> 00:35:49,112
I'M OUT.

00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,015
OKAY.

00:35:52,015 --> 00:35:53,516
Herjavec: SO, HERE --
HERE'S WHERE I'M AT --

00:35:53,516 --> 00:35:54,551
GOT TO BE HONEST,

00:35:54,551 --> 00:35:56,553
NOT THAT INTERESTED
IN THE DRUMPANTS.

00:35:56,553 --> 00:35:58,388
I'M NOT THINKING
ABOUT THAT MARKET

00:35:58,388 --> 00:36:01,157
'CAUSE I'M SO EXCITED
ABOUT THE NEXT MARKET.

00:36:01,157 --> 00:36:02,358
IT'S A BIT OF A FLYER

00:36:02,358 --> 00:36:04,360
'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH
OF THESE YOU'RE GONNA SELL,

00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,229
BUT I THINK
THERE'S SOMETHING THERE.

00:36:06,229 --> 00:36:08,098
I MEAN, I THINK
I CAN HELP YOU WITH THIS.

00:36:08,098 --> 00:36:10,166
WE DID ALMOST $4 MILLION
FOR THE ChordBuddy,

00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:12,235
AND THAT'S
A VERY LOW-TECH PRODUCT.

00:36:12,235 --> 00:36:14,437
UM, I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.

00:36:19,209 --> 00:36:22,078
I'LL GIVE YOU $150,000
FOR 20%.

00:36:23,446 --> 00:36:25,148
BOO-YAH.

00:36:25,148 --> 00:36:28,051
RESPECTFULLY,
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO --

00:36:28,051 --> 00:36:31,154
TO LISTEN TO WHAT MARK HAS --
IF HE'S...

00:36:31,154 --> 00:36:32,222
THAT'S A GOOD --
THAT'S A GOOD OFFER.

00:36:32,222 --> 00:36:34,224
WHAT IF MARK
HAS NOTHING TO SAY?

00:36:34,224 --> 00:36:35,558
Yu: WELL, THEN...
YOU MAY LOSE THAT.

00:36:37,494 --> 00:36:40,263
ARE YOU INTERESTED
IN LICENSING THE TECHNOLOGY?

00:36:40,263 --> 00:36:41,431
DEFINITELY.

00:36:41,431 --> 00:36:43,199
IF IT'S JUST PURELY
A LICENSING PLAY,

00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:45,435
AND I WOULD OFFER YOU
$250,000 FOR 20%.

00:36:48,338 --> 00:36:51,107
THE LICENSING DEAL
IS A GREAT DEAL,

00:36:51,107 --> 00:36:54,043
BUT YOU'RE ONLY GETTING MONEY
IF THE STUFF SELLS.
Yu: RIGHT.

00:36:54,043 --> 00:36:55,345
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY --
John:
NO, NO. OH, NO. INCORRECT.

00:36:55,345 --> 00:36:57,080
SO -- SO THEN, MY QUESTION --
SEE, THAT'S A BIG MISTAKE

00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,182
BECAUSE LICENSES
ARE UP-FRONT CASH

00:36:59,182 --> 00:37:02,051
AND GUARANTEED MINIMUMS.

00:37:03,219 --> 00:37:05,155
HERE'S THE WAY IT GOES,
ALL RIGHT?

00:37:05,155 --> 00:37:08,324
SO, YOU GO TO A -- A PERSON
WHO MAKES THIS TYPE OF PRODUCT.

00:37:08,324 --> 00:37:10,126
YOU SAY,
"HEY, WE HAVE THIS DEVICE.

00:37:10,126 --> 00:37:11,227
WHAT CAN YOU DO?"

00:37:11,227 --> 00:37:14,197
AND THEY GO,
"WE SERVICE ALL THE GLOW STICKS

00:37:14,197 --> 00:37:15,265
"FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD.

00:37:15,265 --> 00:37:17,267
"WE WANT TO ADD THIS
INTO OUR CATALOGUE.

00:37:17,267 --> 00:37:21,437
WE WILL GUARANTEE YOU AT LEAST
$1 MILLION OF SALES AT 10%."

00:37:21,437 --> 00:37:23,106
SO, YOU'VE GUARANTEED
AT THAT POINT

00:37:23,106 --> 00:37:25,208
THAT YOU'LL GET
$100,000 PER YEAR.

00:37:25,208 --> 00:37:28,511
I SEE THIS AS A PROFITABLE
PROOF OF CONCEPT.

00:37:28,511 --> 00:37:30,513
IT'S THE BIGGER MARKET
I WANT TO BE IN,

00:37:30,513 --> 00:37:34,117
BUT I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU GUYS
GOT TOGETHER AND CAME HERE

00:37:34,117 --> 00:37:35,552
TO BE
IN THE GLOW-STICK MARKET.

00:37:38,555 --> 00:37:40,456
GUYS,
YOU HAVE TO DECIDE RIGHT NOW.

00:37:40,456 --> 00:37:44,260
CAN WE, UH,
CONFER IN THE HALLWAY?

00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,329
YOU KNOW
WHAT HAPPENS IN "SHARK TANK"

00:37:46,329 --> 00:37:47,564
WHEN YOU LEAVE THE TANK --

00:37:47,564 --> 00:37:49,132
NASTY, NASTY THINGS.

00:37:50,433 --> 00:37:52,368
WHAT IS WRONG?
YOU'VE GOT TWO OFFERS.

00:37:52,368 --> 00:37:53,503
YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION.

00:38:05,381 --> 00:38:07,283
Narrator:
TWO SHARKS ARE OUT.

00:38:07,283 --> 00:38:09,252
TYLER AND LEI
HAVE OFFERS ON THE TABLE

00:38:09,252 --> 00:38:10,520

WHAT IS WRONG?

00:38:27,103 --> 00:38:28,471
YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION.

00:38:28,471 --> 00:38:30,206
WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE.

00:38:30,206 --> 00:38:31,207
GO AHEAD. GO AHEAD.
GO AHEAD.

00:38:31,207 --> 00:38:32,208
THANK YOU.

00:38:32,208 --> 00:38:33,509
NASTY THINGS.

00:38:37,247 --> 00:38:39,215
WELL,
I LIKE DAYMOND'S OFFER

00:38:39,215 --> 00:38:40,383
'CAUSE IT'S MORE MONEY

00:38:40,383 --> 00:38:42,352
AND HE'S GONNA HELP US
WITH THE LICENSING.

00:38:46,389 --> 00:38:48,124
YEAH,
BUT <i>WE</i> UNDERSTAND IT.

00:38:48,124 --> 00:38:50,159
THAT'S NOT GONNA HELP US,

00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:53,096
LIKE, DEVELOP
OUR NEXT-GENERATION PRODUCT.

00:38:53,096 --> 00:38:55,531
AND --
OKAY, BUT...

00:38:55,531 --> 00:38:58,134
LIKE,
DAYMOND'S OFFERING

00:38:58,134 --> 00:39:01,104
ALMOST TWICE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY
FOR THE SAME PERCENTAGE.

00:39:04,407 --> 00:39:06,342
LEI,
I'M GETTING OLD HERE!

00:39:06,342 --> 00:39:07,477
LET'S JUST GO.

00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,147
I REALLY DON'T.
I THINK IT WILL.

00:39:11,147 --> 00:39:13,383
HE KNOWS ALL THE PEOPLE
THAT WE WANT TO TALK TO.

00:39:13,383 --> 00:39:15,084
[DRUMROLL]
Herjavec:
LET'S GET A DRUMROLL, KEVIN.

00:39:15,084 --> 00:39:16,452
Greiner: THEY'RE GONNA SAY,
"I TAKE NO OFFER."

00:39:16,452 --> 00:39:18,121
[CHUCKLES]

00:39:18,121 --> 00:39:20,223
O'Leary: SO, LET'S JUST
SUMMARIZE WHERE WE'RE AT.

00:39:21,424 --> 00:39:24,427
ROBERT HAS OFFERED YOU $150,000
FOR 20%,

00:39:24,427 --> 00:39:26,095
LIKES WHERE YOU'RE GOING,

00:39:26,095 --> 00:39:27,363
DOESN'T CARE
HOW YOU GET REVENUE.

00:39:27,363 --> 00:39:28,498
DAYMOND'S MORE SPECIFIC.

00:39:28,498 --> 00:39:30,099
HE'S WILLING TO OFFER
MORE MONEY --

00:39:30,099 --> 00:39:32,035
$250,000 FOR 20%

00:39:32,035 --> 00:39:34,404
WITH A DISTINCT DIRECTION
IN LICENSING.

00:39:34,404 --> 00:39:36,272
WHAT HAVE YOU DECIDED TO DO?

00:39:36,272 --> 00:39:40,376
ROBERT, IF YOU WOULD DO
15% FOR $150,000...

00:39:44,347 --> 00:39:46,149
SO, YOU'RE COUNTERING ROBERT?

00:39:46,149 --> 00:39:48,184
AND YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED
IN DAYMOND'S OFFER.
HOLD ON.

00:39:48,184 --> 00:39:49,385
IS THAT CORRECT?
WELL, NO, NO.
WELL, ARE YOU?

00:39:49,385 --> 00:39:54,357
SO, WE'RE GONNA GO --
I THINK WE WOULD LIKE...

00:39:54,357 --> 00:39:58,461
WELL, IDEALLY,
WE WOULD WANT TO HAVE A --

00:39:58,461 --> 00:40:01,230
IT WOULD -- IT WOULD BE NICE
TO HAVE A DEAL

00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,498
BETWEEN ALL OF THE SHARKS.

00:40:02,498 --> 00:40:04,467
UH, YOU KNOW, ONE THING
ABOUT BEING IN THE TANK IS,

00:40:04,467 --> 00:40:06,502
I LOVE PEOPLE
TO BE DECISIVE.

00:40:09,105 --> 00:40:10,406
SO, I'M OUT.

00:40:12,508 --> 00:40:15,144
SO, NOW IT'S ON YOU, ROB.

00:40:17,246 --> 00:40:21,150
I'M GONNA STICK AT THE 20%.

00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:23,052
MARK, DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
TO ADD?

00:40:24,554 --> 00:40:26,289
I THINK
W-WHAT YOUR CHALLENGE IS --

00:40:26,289 --> 00:40:28,324
AND YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD THIS
YOUR ENTIRE LIVES --

00:40:28,324 --> 00:40:29,492
IS YOU'RE BOTH
VERY DELIBERATE.

00:40:29,492 --> 00:40:31,127
NO, THEY'RE NOT.
THEY CAN'T MAKE A DECISION.

00:40:31,127 --> 00:40:32,195
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

00:40:32,195 --> 00:40:33,396
BUT THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM,
RIGHT?

00:40:33,396 --> 00:40:34,464
SOMETIMES, THE PERF--

00:40:34,464 --> 00:40:36,132
THE PERFECT IS THE ENEMY
OF THE GOOD, RIGHT?

00:40:36,132 --> 00:40:39,102
PARALYSIS VIA ANALYSIS.
AND THAT'S WHY I WAS LISTENING.

00:40:39,102 --> 00:40:40,436
THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING
TO GET A SENSE OF

00:40:40,436 --> 00:40:43,272
'CAUSE I LIKE THE PRODUCT,

00:40:43,272 --> 00:40:45,475
BUT YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE
A FORCEFUL WAY TO GET THERE.

00:40:45,475 --> 00:40:48,211
AND I DON'T KNOW
THAT YOU COULD REALLY ACCEPT

00:40:48,211 --> 00:40:49,379
A FORCEFUL WAY
TO GET THERE.

00:40:49,379 --> 00:40:51,280
AND FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.

00:40:53,316 --> 00:40:55,518
I WAS THE FIRST GUY
TO MAKE YOU AN OFFER.

00:40:55,518 --> 00:40:57,420
I THOUGHT I MADE YOU
A FAIR OFFER.

00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:00,390
THEN YOU LISTENED
TO DAYMOND'S OFFER,

00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,125
WHICH IS VERY RESPECTFUL,

00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:05,528
AND AT THE VERY END OF IT ALL,
I REITERATED MY OFFER,

00:41:05,528 --> 00:41:08,331
TYLER LOOKED AT ME
FOR A MOMENT

00:41:08,331 --> 00:41:10,400
AND THEN LOOKED OVER
AT MARK.

00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,036
WE'RE DEFINITELY INTERESTED
IN YOUR OFFER, BUT --

00:41:13,036 --> 00:41:15,338
I'M OUT.

00:41:15,338 --> 00:41:18,207
I TOLD YOU NASTY THINGS CAN
HAPPEN WHEN YOU LEAVE THE TANK.

00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:26,182
SO, TO -- I GUESS THE REASON
TO EXPLAIN WHY WE --

00:41:26,182 --> 00:41:28,217
WE DON'T NEED TO KNOW.
YOU GOT --
YOU HAVE NOBODY LEFT.

00:41:28,217 --> 00:41:30,520
WHY WE WANTED TO WAIT
TO SEE...
WE'RE GOOD. THAT'S IT.

00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,388
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE EXAMPLE
OF TWO ENTREPRENEURS

00:41:32,388 --> 00:41:35,091
THAT WERE INCAPABLE
OF MAKING A DECISION.

00:41:35,091 --> 00:41:36,526
LEI, YOU KNOW WHY --
LEI, YOU KNOW WHY --
IT'S NOT THAT WE'RE INCAPABLE
OF MAKING A DECISION.

00:41:36,526 --> 00:41:38,361
LEI, IT DOESN'T --
NO, LOOK,
YOU CAN'T MAKE A DECISION.

00:41:38,361 --> 00:41:40,363
THERE'S NOBODY LEFT.
WE CAN'T DO THAT
ON $150,000 --

00:41:40,363 --> 00:41:42,198
I FORBID YOU
TO SPEAK ANYMORE.
NO, WE --
YOU KNOW, WE GET THAT.

00:41:42,198 --> 00:41:44,267
PLEASE LEAVE.
$150,000, GONE.

00:41:44,267 --> 00:41:46,169
$250,000, VAPORIZED.

00:41:46,169 --> 00:41:47,370
NOW YOU'RE VAPORIZED.
GET OUT OF HERE.

00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,138
BUT -- BUT --
NO BUTS.

00:41:49,138 --> 00:41:51,240
BUT NOW
THAT WE UNDERSTAND...
GONE. GONE.

00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,508
BYE. YOU GUYS GOT TO GO.
SORRY.
...WHERE THE SHARKS
STAND --

00:41:52,508 --> 00:41:54,210
WOULD -- WOULD IT
BE POSSIBLE FOR US...
Cuban: GOOD LUCK. BYE.

00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:55,411
GUYS, IT'S TOO LATE.
...TO ACCEPT YOUR OFFER?

00:41:55,411 --> 00:41:57,246
LET SOMEONE ELSE
HAVE A CHANCE.

00:41:59,215 --> 00:42:00,450
LIFE DOESN'T WORK
THAT WAY.

00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,385
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.

00:42:06,222 --> 00:42:08,558
WELL, SHOULD HAVE GONE
WITH DAYMOND.

00:42:08,558 --> 00:42:10,326
TOLD YOU.

00:42:10,326 --> 00:42:13,196
INCREDIBLE.
ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE.

00:42:13,196 --> 00:42:14,464
NOW, THAT WAS
THE FIRST DATE.

00:42:14,464 --> 00:42:17,033
IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
AFTER THAT.

00:42:17,033 --> 00:42:18,334
I GUARANTEE YOU

00:42:18,334 --> 00:42:20,169
THIS HAPPENS TO THEM
EVERY DAY OF THEIR LIVES.

00:42:20,169 --> 00:42:22,205
I CAN IMAGINE THEM
TRYING TO PICK OUT LUNCH.

00:42:22,205 --> 00:42:24,140
WHY ARE YOU STILL TALKING
ABOUT THEM? THEY'RE GONE!

00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,341
THEY'RE DEAD.
THEY'RE GONE.
