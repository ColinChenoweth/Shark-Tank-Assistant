00:00:01,235 --> 00:00:02,369
Narrator:
WELCOME TO THE SHARK TANK,

00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:05,205
WHERE ENTREPRENEURS
SEEK AN INVESTMENT

00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:07,975
TO START, GROW, OR SAVE
THEIR BUSINESS.

00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,343
OUR CAKES ARE THE FUTURE
OF THE WEDDING CAKE.

00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:11,245
HOW CLEVER THAT IS.

00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:13,247
Narrator: IF THE SHARKS HEAR
A GREAT IDEA...

00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:15,315
WHEN YOU WALKED IN HERE,
I THOUGHT,

00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:16,450
"CHA-CHING-A-LING-A-DING-DONG."

00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,485
I THINK
YOU'RE ONTO SOMETHING.

00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:21,021
YOU'LL PAY FOR YOUR COLLEGE
IF THIS WORKS.

00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,322
Narrator: ...THEY'LL INVEST
THEIR OWN MONEY...

00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:25,092
YOU COULD TALK A DOG OFF
A MEAT WAGON, I'M TELLING YOU.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:27,027
...AND FIGHT
EACH OTHER FOR A DEAL.

00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,396
I'LL GIVE YOU THE 35K.
I WANT TO BE A 50/50 PARTNER.

00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:32,299
I DON'T INVEST
IN RICH KIDS' BUSINESSES.

00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,201
DON'T SCREW IT UP.

00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:37,037
Narrator: BUT THE ENTREPRENEURS
MUST GET THE FULL AMOUNT

00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:40,040
THEY'RE ASKING FOR, OR THEY'LL
WALK AWAY WITH NOTHING.

00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,208
I'M SO CLOSE TO
GETTING OVER THE HILL ON THIS.

00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,976
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S A BUNCH OF CRAP.

00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:45,145
YOU'RE NOT EVEN A PIMPLE
ON A TEENAGER. YOU'RE NOTHING.

00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,382
Narrator:
WHO ARE THE SHARKS?

00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:54,154
THEY'RE SELF-MADE
BUSINESS EXPERTS WORTH BILLIONS.

00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:58,225
KEVIN O'LEARY IS A SHREWD
VENTURE CAPITALIST

00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,093
WHO MADE HIS FORTUNE

00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:01,995
SELLING A CHILDREN'S
EDUCATIONAL COMPANY

00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:04,264
FOR OVER $4 BILLION.

00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:08,168
BARBARA CORCORAN WENT FROM
WAITING TABLES IN MANHATTAN

00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:12,406
TO BUILDING THE CITY'S PREMIER
$2 BILLION REAL-ESTATE EMPIRE.

00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,376
ROBERT HERJAVEC, SON OF
AN IMMIGRANT FACTORY WORKER,

00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:17,978
FOUNDED ONE OF

00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:21,381
THE WORLD'S PREEMINENT
CYBER-SECURITY FIRMS.

00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:25,485
LORI GREINER, THE QUEEN OF QVC,
HOLDS OVER 100 PATENTS

00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:28,088
AND HAS LAUNCHED
OVER 400 PRODUCTS,

00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,390
GROSSING OVER A HALF A BILLION
DOLLARS IN SALES.

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,095
AND MARK CUBAN,
RENOWNED BILLIONAIRE TECH MOGUL

00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:39,099
AND THE OUTSPOKEN OWNER
OF THE DALLAS MAVERICKS.

00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,210
FIRST INTO THE TANK
ARE MOTHER-AND-SON ENTREPRENEURS

00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,446
WITH A NEW TWIST
ON A WEDDING TRADITION.

00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,322
HI.
MY NAME IS KIMBERLY AYA.

00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:05,225
AND I'M HER SON KORAY, AND WE'RE
FROM GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN,

00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:07,327
AND OUR COMPANY
IS FUNCAKES.

00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:10,330
WE'RE HERE TODAY
ASKING FOR $285,000

00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,001
IN EXCHANGE FOR 25% EQUITY
IN OUR COMPANY.

00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:15,135
WE BELIEVE
THAT EVERY BRIDE

00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,304
DESERVES TO HAVE A GORGEOUS CAKE
AT HER WEDDING.

00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:20,173
BUT THOSE SKY-HIGH TIERS,
INTRICATE DESIGNS,

00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:23,143
SUGAR FLOWERS -- THEY ALL COME
AT A STEEP COST.

00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,278
THE PRICE OF WEDDINGS
HAS GOTTEN OUT OF HAND,

00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:27,114
ESPECIALLY
IN TODAY'S ECONOMY.

00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:29,216
SO BRIDES ON A BUDGET --
THEY COME TO US

00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:32,352
BECAUSE WE DELIVER IT ALL BUT
ONLY AT A SLICE OF THE PRICE.

00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,421
BUT ON TOP OF THAT,
WE HAVE A NEW AND UNIQUE CAKE.

00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:35,989
IT HAS ZERO CALORIES.

00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,125
IT IS GLUTEN-FREE,
SUGAR-FREE, LACTOSE-FREE,

00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,460
AND IT HAS A SHELF LIFE
OF 7-PLUS YEARS.

00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,363
SO, YOU MAY ASK,
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:46,299
WELL, OUR CAKES...

00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,335
ARE MADE OF FOAM.
Corcoran: [ Laughing ] OH!

00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,337
AND THEY'RE RENTALS.
GREAT FOOLER.

00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,072
WOW.
OUR CAKES ARE COVERED

00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:54,975
IN REAL FONDANT AND GUM PASTE,
EXACTLY THE SAME AS A REAL CAKE.

00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:57,177
THE ONLY THING DIFFERENT
IS THE INSIDE IS FOAM.

00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,113
EACH CAKE HAS
A SECRET COMPARTMENT IN THE BACK

00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:02,082
WHERE REAL CAKE
CAN BE PLACED.

00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:04,418
THIS WAY, THE BRIDE AND GROOM
CAN STILL CUT THE CAKE,

00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:06,420
FEED EACH OTHER,
GET ALL THEIR PHOTOS.

00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,188
THEN THE CAKE
IS WHEELED TO THE BACK,

00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,190
AND SHEET CAKES
ARE SERVED TO THEIR GUESTS.

00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,160
NO ONE IS THE WISER.
HOW CLEVER THAT IS.

00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,162
WE SEE THIS AS THE FUTURE
OF THE WEDDING CAKE.

00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:17,264
WE HOPE TO KEEP THE TRADITION
OF THE WEDDING CAKE ALIVE,

00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:18,999
BUT AT A PRICE
COUPLES CAN AFFORD.

00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:22,069
SO, SHARKS, WHO WANTS
TO JOIN THE FUN WITH FUNCAKES?

00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:25,272
OUR CAKES MAY BE FAKE,
BUT OUR MONEY IS REAL.

00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:27,074
THE IDEA'S BRILLIANT.
THANK YOU.

00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:29,176
ONE -- ARE THERE
OTHER PEOPLE DOING IT?
NO.

00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:30,410
NOBODY ELSE?

00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,280
THERE ARE A FEW PEOPLE WHO HAVE
COPIED US, BUT NOBODY SHIPS.

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,215
WE SHIP OUR CAKES
WORLDWIDE.

00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,349
AND THEY SHIP THEM
BACK TO YOU AFTER?

00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,018
CORRECT.
CAN YOU SHIP A CAKE
THAT BIG,

00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:39,352
OR DOES SOMEBODY
HAVE TO ASSEMBLE IT?

00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:42,022
NO. YOU OPEN UP THE BOX,
AND IT'S READY TO GO.

00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:43,356
THERE'S ONE EDIBLE SECTION
IN THE BACK.

00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:44,424
THREE TWINKIES
AND A CAN OF FROSTING

00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,193
IS ALL THEY NEED
TO FILL THAT.

00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:48,261
THREE TWINKIES?

00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:49,996
SO, HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN DOING THIS?

00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,231
WE'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS
SEVEN YEARS.

00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,234
WE HAVE OVER $5 MILLION
IN PUBLICITY WITH OUR COMPANY.

00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,204
SO, THE MAGIC QUESTION --
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?

00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:59,439
I'VE TALKED ENOUGH.
THIS YEAR,
WE'VE DONE $150,000 IN SALES.

00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:03,210
THAT'S IT?

00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,412
WE DID A GROSS PROFIT
OF $76,000.

00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,415
$150,000 IN SALES
AFTER 7 YEARS?

00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:11,084
WE JUST LEARNED
SOMETHING HERE.

00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,987
AFTER SEVEN YEARS,
IT'S CLEAR TO ME

00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:17,124
THAT PEOPLE DON'T WANT
A FAKE CAKE AT THEIR WEDDING.

00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:19,092
EXACT OPPOSITE.
SEE, BUT
IT'S THE EXACT OPPOSITE.

00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,162
AFTER SEVEN YEARS, WHAT WE HAVE
BUILT IS AN IDEA AND A BRAND.

00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:23,230
YOU HAVEN'T BUILT ANYTHING.

00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,065
IN THE WEDDING INDUSTRY,

00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:28,301
YOU'RE NOT EVEN A PIMPLE
ON A TEENAGER. YOU'RE NOTHING.

00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:29,369
FOR RIGHT NOW.
AND THE BIG THING
HAS BEEN --

00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,138
SEVEN YEARS.
YOU'RE SEVEN YEARS IN.

00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:33,106
RIGHT.
Koray: I MEAN, WHEN WE GOT ON
THE "TODAY" SHOW,

00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,308
IT WAS MORE ABOUT,
"LOOK AT THESE CRAZY PEOPLE.

00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:37,377
THEY HAVE THIS OBSCENE IDEA
TO RENT CAKES."

00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,212
WHO CARES? YOU KEEP GOING BACK
TO THE PUBLICITY.

00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,213
YOU SEEM
VERY PROUD OF THAT.

00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:41,414
I'M JUST EXPLAINING
THAT WE'VE HAD THAT.

00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,150
BUT YOU SEEM
VERY PROUD OF IT.
OH, OF COURSE I AM.

00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,417
AND IT'S TURNED INTO NOTHING.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,386
BELIEVE ME, WE WOULDN'T
COME IN FRONT OF YOU

00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:50,023
WITH SUCH A FABULOUS IDEA
AND ONLY $150,000 IN SALES...
O'Leary: OKAY, KIMBERLY.

00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,158
...AND EXPECT YOU TO --
LET ME ASK A QUESTION.

00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:52,425
GO AHEAD, FINISH.
WHAT'S GONNA CHANGE?

00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,060
WHAT IS MISSING?
LET HER FINISH.

00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,196
Kimberly: SO, WE HAVE A SET
OF 200 GROCERY STORES IN CHICAGO

00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:58,098
THAT ARE SIGNING UP WITH US.
Greiner: WHICH ONE?

00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:01,401
JEWEL-OSCO. AND, SO, THEY'RE
GONNA BE CARRYING OUR CAKES.

00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:02,435
THEY'RE GONNA SELL THEM

00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,371
AND MATCH THEM
WITH THEIR SHEET CAKES.

00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:06,206
SO, A BRIDE
CAN NOW COME IN,

00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:09,976
GET A THREE-TIERED, FAKE CAKE,
TWO SHEET CAKES --

00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,211
ABOUT 200 BUCKS,
SHE'S SET TO GO.

00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:12,245
KORAY, WE NEVER EVEN ASKED

00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,147
HOW MUCH THEY ARE
COMPARED TO REAL CAKES.

00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,348
WHAT'S THE AVERAGE RENTAL?

00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:18,318
SAY THE BROOCH ONE.
THAT'S A THREE-TIERED CAKE.

00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,153
Herjavec:
HOW MUCH IS THAT TO RENT?

00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,288
$150 WOULD BE
THE OVERALL RENTAL.

00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:23,456
WHAT WOULD THAT CAKE COST
IF IT WAS REAL?

00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:26,993
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
$1,200 TO MAKE THAT.

00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,428
REALLY?
Corcoran: AMAZING.

00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,430
Cuban: HOW LONG DOES
THE WEDDING PARTY GET TO KEEP IT

00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,399
BEFORE THEY HAVE TO
SEND IT BACK?
Herjavec:
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,267
THEY SHIP IT BACK ON MONDAY
AFTER THE WEDDING.

00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,036
YOUR TURNAROUND
IS LESS THAN A WEEK.
Koray: YEP.

00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:38,071
OKAY. AND, SO,
HOW MANY DIFFERENT CAKES

00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,073
DO YOU HAVE IN INVENTORY?
ABOUT 150.

00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:43,210
OUT OF THE 150, HOW MANY
MAKE UP THE BULK OF THE REVENUE?

00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,377
Kimberly: PROBABLY HALF.

00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:47,414
BUT WHAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT --
IT'S THE GROCERY STORES.

00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:50,083
O'Leary: STAYING ON THE NUMBERS
FOR A MINUTE,

00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:54,454
YOU'RE TELLING ME IF I GIVE YOU
$285,000, I GET 25%.

00:05:54,454 --> 00:06:00,493
THAT'S A $1.1 MILLION VALUE
FOR A FAKE, FOAM CAKE.

00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:01,995
YES, SIR.

00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:03,196
THAT IS THE NORM
IN JAPAN.

00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:06,066
Herjavec:
YOU KNOW, MOST SMALL BUSINESSES

00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:09,035
GET SOLD BASED ON
THEIR <i>EARNINGS.</i>

00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,104
MOST SMALL BUSINESSES
DON'T GET SOLD TIMES REVENUE.

00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:14,241
ESPECIALLY NOT SEVEN YEARS IN.
YOU'RE NOT AN I --
YOU'RE NOT AN I.P. COMPANY.

00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:16,977
YOU DON'T OWN
ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:18,078
WHAT ARE YOUR EARNINGS?

00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:19,379
ON $150,000...
THEY SAID.

00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,348
...WHAT DID YOU MAKE LAST YEAR?
NO, THEY DIDN'T.

00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:22,983
$76,000
WAS OUR GROSS PROFIT.

00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,351
WE PAID OURSELVES
A NET INCOME OF $17,000.

00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:27,287
SO, YOU MADE $17,000
ON $150,000.

00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:28,321
YES.
MM-HMM.

00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,190
YEP.
Greiner: LET ME JUST SAY THIS.

00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,359
FIRST OF ALL, FAKE AND CAKE
SHOULD NOT GO TOGETHER --

00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:34,227
FOR ME.
I WANT REAL CAKE.

00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,162
THE OTHER THING IS...

00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,298
YOU <i>ARE</i> HAVING REAL CAKE
IN SHEET CAKE.
...AT A WEDDING...

00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:40,367
...I DON'T WANT MY "SOMETHING
BORROWED" TO BE MY CAKE.

00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:43,003
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.

00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:47,040
GUYS, I THINK
IT'S A BRILLIANT PRODUCT.

00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,377
YOU GUYS HAVE 150 CAKES
IN INVENTORY.

00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:52,412
THAT MEANS
YOU HAVE THE POTENTIAL

00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,381
EVERY WEEKEND
TO MAKE $22,000,

00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:57,450
50 WEEKS A YEAR, A MILLION
DOLLARS A YEAR MINIMUM,

00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,186
AND YOU GUYS DID
10% OF THAT AT MOST.

00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:03,123
YOU GUYS
ARE NOT GRINDERS.

00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:04,457
YOU GUYS
AREN'T OUT THERE

00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:07,294
MAKING THIS
EVERYTHING THAT CONSUMES YOU.

00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:08,328
I'M OUT.

00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,067
NOW THAT I UNDERSTAND
YOUR REVENUE,

00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:15,302
LET ME MAKE AN OBSERVATION.

00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:17,137
PEOPLE THAT ARE
GETTING MARRIED,

00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:19,439
HOPING TO STAY IN LOVE
FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME,

00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,042
DON'T WANT A FAKE CAKE.

00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,244
WHAT THIS DOES
IS ACTUALLY CAUSES DIVORCE.

00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:25,312
THAT'S WHAT I THINK.
[ GASPS ]

00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:26,947
[ LAUGHS ]
WELL, THE ISSUE --

00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,949
I THINK WHEN YOU TELL
YOUR BRIDE, OR VICE VERSA,

00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:32,452
"HONEY, THIS CAKE IS FAKE
JUST LIKE OUR LOVE."

00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,054
[ LAUGHS ]

00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:37,057
AND THAT'S WHY --
THAT'S WHY THIS ISN'T WORKING.

00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:40,226
THAT'S WHY PEOPLE ARE NOT
RENTING THESE FAKE CAKES --

00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,162
BECAUSE YOU
ARE AGAINST LOVE...

00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:45,065
[ LAUGHTER ]
...NOT JUST MONEY.

00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:48,001
AND SO, FOR THE SAKE OF
ALL OF THE MARRIAGES COMING UP,

00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,402
I'M OUT
WITH EXTREME PREJUDICE.

00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:52,339
Herjavec: LOOK, I --
HERE'S THE FIRST THING

00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,441
YOU GUYS NEED TO DO IF YOU'RE
GONNA STAY IN BUSINESS --

00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:56,977
YOU NEED SOMEBODY ON YOUR TEAM
WHO KNOWS NUMBERS.

00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,179
YOUR GRASP OF THE FINANCIAL PART
OF THE BUSINESS

00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:01,081
IS -- IS REALLY LOOSE.

00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:03,216
AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW
YOUR NUMBERS, YOU'RE...

00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,251
YOU'RE JUST ON YOUR WAY
TO BANKRUPTCY,

00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,053
AND YOU JUST DON'T KNOW IT.

00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,154
UH, I'M OUT.

00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,291
IS ANYBODY LEFT?

00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,259
SO, BARBARA,
THAT ONLY LEAVES YOU.

00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,129
I HAPPEN TO THINK
YOUR IDEA IS EXTREMELY CLEVER,

00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:17,330
AND NEEDED, BY THE WAY.

00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,432
THANK YOU.
I WAS SHOCKED
TO HEAR THE COST...

DEFINITELY.
...OF A WEDDING CAKE.

00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:23,003

AND I WAS ABOUT
TO LEAVE MY SECOND HUSBAND

AND BE REMARRIED,
BUT I'M NOT GONNA DO IT

00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:27,207
BECAUSE THE CAKES
ARE TOO EXPENSIVE.

[ LAUGHTER ]

00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,176
BUT THERE'S TWO PARTS
TO EVERY BUSINESS.

00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,312
IT'S THE BUSINESS
AND THE ENTREPRENEUR.

00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:34,147
I THINK IT'S A CLEVER IDEA.

00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:38,084
THAT BEING SAID, I CAN'T BELIEVE
THE TWO OF YOU WORKED LAST YEAR

00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:39,986
FOR $17,000 COMBINED.

00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,221
WHAT ARE YOU, NUTS?
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:43,356
I THINK THAT
WE SEE THE FUTURE IN IT.

00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,258
AND BECAUSE
WE HAD GONE TO --

00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:49,062
AFTER 7 YEARS, $17,000.
YOU'RE FINALLY SEEING THE FUTURE
AFTER SEVEN YEARS.

00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:50,130
THAT DOESN'T SAY TO ME,

00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,365
"I'VE GOT ENTREPRENEURS
THAT ARE HUNGRY TO RUN."

00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,167
I DON'T TRUST YOU,

00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:55,435
THAT YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT
TO THE FINISH LINE.

00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:58,004
JUST TO SHOW THAT WE'RE
WILLING TO CHANGE, WE'RE
WILLING TO LEARN --

00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,305

IT'S BEEN SEVEN YEARS.

BUT ONCE THEY GET IT,
THEY LOVE IT.

A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE
CAN PUT YOU DOWN,

00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:16,389
BUT AS AN ENTREPRENEUR,

00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,358
YOU GOT TO KEEP PUSHING BACK UP
AND KEEP GOING.

THE LITTLE SECRET DOOR
WITH THE TWINKIE IN IT."

IT WAS THE ENTREPRENEURS.

AND WE'RE ALSO SELLING IT
TO A BOUTIQUE,

00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,439
A HARDWARE STORE,
AND A BOX STORE.

00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,675
ARE YOU SELLING THIS ONLINE?
YEAH. THIS IS ACTUALLY
HOW WE STARTED. WE STARTED --

00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:39,344
AND WHAT PERCENTAGE
OF YOUR SALES IS STILL ONLINE?

00:14:39,344 --> 00:14:40,579
WELL, WE DO
ABOUT THIRD EQUALLY.

00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:42,347
SO, WE HAVE A THIRD
ONLINE SALES,

00:14:42,347 --> 00:14:44,616
A THIRD GO INTO
OUR WHOLESALE RETAIL ACCOUNTS,

00:14:44,616 --> 00:14:46,585
AND OUR OTHER THIRD WE DID
THROUGH DEAL SITES

00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:48,320
WHERE WE WERE
TESTING THE MARKET.

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,456
HOW MUCH OF THE BUSINESS
HAVE YOU ACTUALLY DONE

00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:51,490
VERSUS JUST YOUR DAD?

00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,492
UM, I'M INVOLVED
IN EVERY SALE THAT WE DO.

00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:55,394
WE'VE GONE TO
ALL THE VENDORS TOGETHER.

00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,629
HE CHOSE THE PAPER.
HE'S BEEN TO THE PRINTERS.

00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:01,633
HE -- THAT'S, YOU KNOW, SORT OF
WHY OUR SALES ARE SO SMALL...
WHAT A GREAT EDUCATION.

00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:03,736
...IS I HAVE HIM DO THE SALES,
AND HE'S BEEN AWESOME.

00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,604
Corcoran:
SO YOU'RE THE REAL BUSINESSMAN,

00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:07,439
AND HE'S JUST
TAKING ALL THE CREDIT HERE?

00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,508
[ CHUCKLES ]
I'M DEFINITELY BEHIND IT.

00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:12,611
I MEAN, THAT KIND OF GOES INTO
THE STORY OF WHY WE DID THIS.

00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:16,281
I -- WHEN NOAH WAS BORN,
I WAS GETTING MY MBA.

00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:18,317
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO BE AN ENTREPRENEUR.

00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:20,552
BUT WHEN I BROUGHT HOME
THAT LITTLE GUY, UM...

00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,755
YOU KNOW, I-IT'S A FEELING
OF RESPONSIBILITY,

00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,423
THAT YOU HAVE TO
BE CAREFUL.

00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,626
AND I NEVER GOT THE CHANCE
TO TAKE THAT -- THAT RISK.

00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:31,430
SO, YOU'RE REALLY ALSO LIVING
YOUR OLD DREAM THROUGH HIM.
YEAH. I-I DON'T WANT
TO TEACH HIM

00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,398
THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE PATH
IN LIFE,

00:15:33,398 --> 00:15:35,567
THAT YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW
THIS CORPORATE LADDER.

00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,569
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:39,438
TO OWN MY OWN BUSINESS
AND SHOW HIM THAT.

00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,742
ARE YOU ADVERSE IN OFFERING
A VERSION THAT INCLUDES THE BOX?

00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:46,311
BECAUSE THERE IS
SOME SEGMENT OF THE MARKET

00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:48,514
THAT FALLS INTO MY CATEGORY
THAT SAYS --
LAZY.

00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:49,748
EXACTLY.
"I'M LAZY. I WANT A SOLUTION.

00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:51,350
I'M WILLING TO PAY MORE."

00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,552
BECAUSE I SEE IT, I LOVE IT.
IT'S SIMPLE.

00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:56,555
IT FALLS INTO THIS TREND
OF ANTI-ELECTRONICS TOYS.

00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:57,623
EXACTLY.

00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,424
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,
HERE'S WHAT I'LL DO.

00:15:59,424 --> 00:16:00,626
I-I LIKE THE STORY.

00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,528
I'LL GIVE YOU THE 35K.

00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:05,364
I WANT TO BE A 50/50 PARTNER
WITH ONE CONDITION...

00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:09,301
...YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE BOX
AVAILABLE FOR ME TO BUY ONLINE.

00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,370
YOU DO NOT HAVE
TO PUT IT THROUGH RETAIL.

00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,504
YOU CAN START WITH THAT.

00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:14,606
AND, NOAH,
I GOT THE BAD NEWS FOR YOU --

00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:16,575
YOU'VE GOT TO
DROP OUT OF SCHOOL.

00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:18,677
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU GOT TO BE FULL-TIME, BUDDY.

00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:20,412
THAT'S HOW YOU RUN A BUSINESS.
WHAT GRADE ARE YOU IN, NOAH?

00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:21,547
I'M IN 8th GRADE.

00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:23,448
IT'S TIME.
SO WHAT? YOU MISS A FEW GRADES.

00:16:23,448 --> 00:16:24,817
NOT A PROBLEM.

00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:28,353
WELL, UM, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR YOUR OFFER, KEVIN.

00:16:28,353 --> 00:16:30,422
WE'RE SUPER GRATEFUL

TO GIVE US THIS CHANCE
AND SEE THIS FUTURE,

00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:33,792
AND WE WERE JUST WONDERING

00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:36,762
IF THERE'S ANY OTHER OFFERS
ON THE TABLE.
GUYS, CONGRATULATIONS.

00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:40,399
I THINK YOU'RE SETTING
AN EXAMPLE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,403
THAT A PARENT AND A CHILD CAN
BOND OVER CREATING A COMPANY.

00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:45,571
I JUST DON'T KNOW

00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:48,574
IF I CAN ADD A LOT OF VALUE
IN THE TOY BUSINESS.

00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,409
KEVIN'S GOT
A LOT MORE EXPERIENCE.

00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,778
I THINK HE MADE YOU A VERY FAIR
OFFER THAT I COULDN'T MATCH.

00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,613
SO FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.

00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:57,616
THANKS. THANK YOU.
WE APPRECIATE IT.
APPRECIATE YOUR HONESTY.

00:16:57,616 --> 00:17:00,652

THANKS.
I LIKE THE LOGO.

00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,389
I LOVE THE SIMPLICITY OF IT.

00:17:04,389 --> 00:17:07,659
BUT I FEEL THAT IT'S NOT REALLY
SOMETHING SCALABLE,

00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:08,694
SO I'M OUT.

00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,796

Herjavec: I GOT TO TELL YOU,

00:17:21,506 --> 00:17:25,377
BEFORE MY SON WAS BORN,
I WAS A LOT LIKE KEVIN.

00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:28,480
I HAD NO HAIR.
I HAD A COLD HEART.

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,315
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A BUCK.

00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:33,585
AND THEN MY SON WAS BORN,
AND IT GAVE ME PURPOSE.

00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:35,587
I MEAN, I STILL WANTED TO MAKE
A BUCK. DON'T GET ME WRONG.

00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:38,423
BUT I WANTED
TO BUILD SOMETHING GREAT.

00:17:38,423 --> 00:17:39,791
I THINK
YOU'RE ONTO SOMETHING.

00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,394
BUT I THINK
YOU'VE GOT TO PACKAGE IT

00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,562
JUST SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY.

00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,531
IF YOU CAN SELL
A COMPLETE PACKAGE,

00:17:46,531 --> 00:17:49,501

OVER KEVIN'S OFFER
SO THAT WE CAN DO THE --
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU,

00:17:56,742 --> 00:18:01,480
I'M NOT SURE YOU WANT TO HAVE
KEVIN AS AN INVESTOR

00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,415
IN A BUSINESS
THAT APPEALS TO CHILDREN.

00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,717
I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT ONE.
KEVIN SCARES CHILDREN.

00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:07,753
THE REASON
THAT'S INCORRECT IS I MADE

00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,455
ALL MY MONEY IN A BUSINESS
THAT APPEALS TO CHILDREN.

00:18:10,455 --> 00:18:12,357

BUT THEY NEVER MET KEVIN.

00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:14,493
...WAS FOR $4 BILLION
TO MATTEL.

00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:15,727
SO I KNOW YOUR INDUSTRY
PRETTY WELL.

00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:19,331

00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,352
ON THE BOOKS,
THIS IS EARNEST CAPITAL.
ERIC, HANG ON.

00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:22,453
YEAH, ROBERT.
TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,554
YOU'VE ALREADY GOT
$2 MILLION.

00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:25,723
YEAH. WE HAVE $2 MILLION.
AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE --

00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:27,425
FROM A FAMILY FRIEND.
FROM A FAMILY MEMBER.

00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:28,826
IT'S OUR FATHER WHO'S THE
EQUITY PARTNER IN THE BUSINESS.

00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:30,394
OH, OKAY.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALE--

00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:31,562
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES --
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES NOW?

00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:34,532
IN UNDER 10 MONTHS,
WE'VE DONE $510,000 IN SALES.

00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:36,734
WHERE ARE YOU SELLING IT NOW?
THE FIRST PERSON TO SEE IT,

00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:39,603
ODDLY ENOUGH,
HAPPENED TO BE A BUYER AT PETCO.

00:35:39,603 --> 00:35:41,572
AM I JUST MASKING THE ODOR,

00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:43,741
OR I'M ACTUALLY
REDUCING WHATEVER...
Greiner:
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:45,509
...THAT'S CREATING THE ODOR?

00:35:45,509 --> 00:35:47,511
IN OTHER WORDS,
IF THERE'S A BACTERIA

00:35:47,511 --> 00:35:49,347
THAT'S ROTTING ON YOUR DOG,

00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:51,515
IS THIS KILLING THE BACTERIA,
OR AM I JUST MASKING IT?

00:35:51,515 --> 00:35:54,385
IT'S MASKING THE ODOR,
WHICH --
Corcoran: FOR HOW LONG
WILL IT MASK THE ODOR?

00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:55,486
Eric: IT REALLY SUSTAINS.

00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,755
THEY TESTED THE CLOTHES
AN HOUR LATER -- NO PROBLEM.

00:35:57,755 --> 00:35:59,690
SO, OUT OF THE $500,000,
IS IT ALL PETCO?

00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,359
NO.
NO.

00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,728
SO, PETCO'S ALMOST HALF
OF OUR BUSINESS SO FAR.

00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:05,529
HOW MANY LOCATIONS?
ALL OF THEM.

00:36:05,529 --> 00:36:07,398
UH, 1,200
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:08,699
AND WHAT'S THE AVERAGE COST
OF A UNIT?

00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:11,469
IT'S 55 -- 55 CENTS,
AND EACH ONE RETAILS FOR $2.99.

00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:13,571
Greiner: COSTS YOU 55 CENTS.
YEAH. REUSABLE.

00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:16,407
EACH WIPE, EACH PET WIPE,
IS $2.99.
CORRECT.

00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:19,477
SO, YEAH.
WHAT ARE YOU PROJECTING
FOR SALES FOR THE NEXT YEAR?

00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:21,412
WE, UH --
FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS,

00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:23,481
WE HAVE $4 MILLION
IN PROJECTED SALES.

00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:25,449
PROJECTING ON WHAT?
BASED ON WHAT?
WHOA.

00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:27,351
AND I UNDERSTAND
IT'S A LEAP.
OKAY. OKAY.

00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,619
I UNDERSTAND IT'S A LEAP.
AND I --

00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:30,421
$500,000 TO $1.5 MILLION
IS A LEAP.

00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:31,589
$500,000 TO $4 MILLION...

00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:33,524
I-I REALLY GOT TO FOCUS
ON A COUPLE OF THINGS HERE

00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,526
THAT NOBODY'S TOUCHED ON,
BUT THANK GOODNESS I'M HERE.

00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,528
YOU'RE OFFERING ME
5% FOR $150,000.

00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,631
THAT IMPUTES A VALUE
OF $3 MILLION.

00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:43,601
AND YOU HAVE TAKEN $2 MILLION
FROM YOUR DAD, RIGHT?

00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,603
WHAT DOES YOUR DAD DO

00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:47,405
THAT HE CAN AFFORD
TO GIVE YOU $2 MILLION?

00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:49,373
OKAY, SO, WE'RE -- WE --
WE'RE VERY LUCKY

00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,509
TO COME FROM A SUCCESSFUL
ENTREPRENEURIAL FAMILY.

00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:53,511
MY DAD'S
A SELF-MADE ENTREPRENEUR.
RIGHT.

00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:55,613
HE STARTED A COMPANY
WHICH IS NOW CALLED GameStop,

00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:57,314
THE MOST SUCCESSFUL RETAIL --
OH, YEAH.

00:36:57,314 --> 00:36:58,482
OH, HE'S THE GameStop FOUNDER?
FAMILIAR WITH GameStop.

00:36:58,482 --> 00:36:59,750
WOW.
Herjavec:
YOU'VE USED THE $2 MILLION.

00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,619
THE $2 MILLION'S GONE.

00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:02,720
CORRECT.

00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,488
WHY DO YOU NEED
THE $150,000?

00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:06,457
WE NEED YOU GUYS.
WE HAVE A BIG MEETING

00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:08,392
WITH THE WORLD'S LARGEST
RETAILER IN AUGUST.

00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,693
IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT
CONVERSATION

00:37:09,693 --> 00:37:11,462
WHEN WE'RE SITTING THERE.
O'Leary: LOOK,
YOU CAN MENTION THE NAME.

00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:13,397
IS IT WALMART?
Both: IT IS WALMART.

00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,699
ARE YOU GONNA DO A TEST, OR ARE
YOU GONNA ROLL ALL THE STORES?

00:37:15,699 --> 00:37:17,768
I THINK IF YOU WERE THERE --
IT WOULD CHANGE
IF YOU WERE THERE.

00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:20,738
IF YOU'RE THERE, HOPEFULLY,
WE'D GET INTO ALL STORES.

00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,340
THIS IS SOME-- HE CAN MAKE
SOME INTRODUCTIONS.
YOUR DAD IS IN YOUR CORNER.

00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,309
WHEN YOU'RE AT A MEETING
WITH WALMART, THEY DON'T CARE.

00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:27,611
Cuban: I THINK
YOU'VE GOT A GOOD PRODUCT.

00:37:27,611 --> 00:37:29,780
BUT FIRST,
YOU'RE NOT A TECHNOLOGY.

00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:33,384
YOU'RE NOT A TECHNOLOGY
ANY MORE THAN TALCUM POWDER.

00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:35,686
YOU'RE CALLING THIS
A TECHNOLOGY

00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:38,556
BECAUSE
THAT'S HOW YOU PLACATE DAD.

00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:40,791
I-I'M SORRY, I DON'T SEE --
IT'S A FORMULATION.

00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:42,793
IT'S A FORMULATION
THAT WORKS.
IN MACHINERY --

00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:45,396
WE ACTUALLY SPENT $150,000
IN CUSTOM MACHINERY.

00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:46,564
THAT DOESN'T
MAKE IT A TECHNOLOGY.

00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:48,466
AND YOU ONLY CALL IT
A TECHNOLOGY

00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:50,367
BECAUSE THAT ALLOWS YOU
TO GO TO DAD

00:37:50,367 --> 00:37:52,436
AND SAY, "DEAR DAD,
WE HAVE A TECHNOLOGY."

00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,437
IT'S NOT A TECHNOLOGY.

00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:04,515
Narrator:
ALL SHARKS ARE STILL IN.

00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:06,684
BUT ERIC AND BEN
HAVE TURNED MARK OFF

00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:08,719
WITH THEIR SPIN ON THE COMPANY.

00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:10,721
Cuban: I THINK
YOU'VE GOT A GOOD PRODUCT.

00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:12,523
BUT FIRST,
YOU'RE NOT A TECHNOLOGY.

00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:13,791
I-I GUESS I MIGHT --
I-I UNDERSTAND.

00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,759
I GUESS I UNDERSTAND
WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM.

00:38:15,759 --> 00:38:18,496
BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IN REGARD
TO THE TECHNOLOGY ASPECT IS...

00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:21,532
UH, WE JUST STARTED THINKING
OF OURSELVES AS TECHNOLOGY

00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:24,502
BECAUSE THE MANUFACTURERS
ARE TELLING US WHAT THIS CAN DO.

00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:26,370
IT CAN BE
A MOSQUITO REPELLENT.

00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,506
YEAH, BUT WAIT. WAIT.
GREAT!
SO CAN TALCUM POWDER!

00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:29,673
IT CAN DO
A LOT OF THINGS, RIGHT?

00:38:29,673 --> 00:38:31,475
YOU KNOW WHAT'S FANTASTIC,
THOUGH?
GUYS -- Shh.

00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,677
I'M SORRY, MARK.
I APOLOGIZE.

00:38:33,677 --> 00:38:34,778
I'M OUT.

00:38:36,313 --> 00:38:37,615
OKAY.
SORRY TO HEAR THAT, MARK.

00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,585
DOES IT BOTHER YOU --
AND TELL ME IF MY MATH IS WRONG,

00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:43,654
BECAUSE I'M STILL STRUGGLING
WITH SOMETHING --

00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,389
YOUR NUMBER-ONE TEST
WAS PETCO.

00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:47,725
YOU'VE DONE $250,000 THERE
IN 1,200 STORES.

00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:50,661
YOU'VE SOLD, IN 10 MONTHS,
$208 PER STORE.

00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,429
THAT'S LIKE 20 BUCKS.

00:38:52,429 --> 00:38:54,465
Greiner: BEN,
LET ME ASK A QUESTION.

00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:55,733
DO YOU AGREE
THAT 20 BUCKS A MONTH

00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:57,601
IS -- IS LIKE RAT POOP
TO A BUYER?

00:38:57,601 --> 00:38:58,702
HE WOULDN'T CARE ABOUT THAT.

00:38:58,702 --> 00:39:00,437
NOT AT SCALE. NOT AT ALL.
THAT'S NOT -- SO --

00:39:00,437 --> 00:39:02,540
YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY
TO GETTING DE-LISTED THERE.

00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,575
YOU NEED MUCH MORE IN SALES

00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:06,377
TO JUSTIFY
A $3 MILLION VALUATION.

00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:09,446
THAT IS THE REASON I'M OUT. I
DON'T CARE ABOUT THE REST OF IT.

00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:12,750
WOW.

00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,753
I FEEL VERY BADLY
SAYING THIS TO YOU,

00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:18,355
BUT I,
AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE,

00:39:18,355 --> 00:39:20,391
DON'T INVEST
IN RICH KIDS' BUSINESSES.

00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:23,661
NOW, THIS IS SAD, BECAUSE
IT'S A PREJUDICE FOR YOU.

00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:27,498
COMING FROM MY BACKGROUND,
THE BEST PRIVILEGE I HAD

00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:30,668
WAS I HAD 1,000 BUCKS
TO TRY TO MAKE A RUN WITH

00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:32,770
THAT I BORROWED, BEGGED,
AND STEAL FOR.

00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,572
YOU GOT TO DO
EVERYTHING IN YOUR POWER,

00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:36,740
'CAUSE THAT CLOCK IS TICKING,
TICK, TICK, TICK, TICK, TICK,

00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,475
AND YOU'RE RUNNING OUT OF GAS.

00:39:38,475 --> 00:39:39,677
YOU WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING?

00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:42,346
THE BIGGEST LIABILITY YOU HAVE
IS YOU'VE GOT A RICH DAD.

00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:44,381
AND THAT'S NOT EVEN YOUR FAULT
AS AN ENTREPRENEUR.

00:39:44,381 --> 00:39:45,549
BECAUSE I HAVE WATCHED --

00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,751
ALL OF MY GREAT ENTREPRENEURS
THAT I'VE INVESTED IN

00:39:47,751 --> 00:39:49,386
HAVE BEEN DIRT-POOR.

00:39:49,386 --> 00:39:51,589
AND I LOVE THEM
POOR, HUNGRY, AND DESPERATE.

00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:54,625
SO I'M OUT.

00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:57,728
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S A BUNCH OF CRAP.

00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:00,397
YOU THINK SO?
BECAUSE WHAT SHE
BASICALLY SAID IS

00:40:00,397 --> 00:40:03,400
MY KIDS WILL NEVER BE SUCCESSFUL
BECAUSE I'M -- I'M WELL-OFF.

00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,501
THAT'S A BUNCH OF CRAP.

00:40:04,501 --> 00:40:07,304
SUCCESS DOESN'T GIVE A DAMN
WHO YOUR DAD IS.

00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:08,505
YOU DID SOMETHING.

00:40:08,505 --> 00:40:09,673
REGARDLESS
OF WHERE YOU CAME FROM,

00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:11,475
YOU GOT $500,000 IN SALES.

00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:12,743
ABSOLUTELY.
Greiner: I DON'T CARE

00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:16,380
IF YOUR DAD WAS RICH OR POOR
OR ANY OF THAT.

00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,682
WHEN YOU WALKED IN HERE,
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF,

00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:20,784
"CHA-CHING-A-LING-A-DING-DONG."
THANK YOU.

00:40:20,784 --> 00:40:22,419
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

00:40:22,419 --> 00:40:26,657
BECAUSE THIS IS
A REALLY GOOD PRODUCT.

00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:29,493
AND SO I'M GONNA
MAKE YOU AN OFFER.

00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:31,362
WOW.

00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:35,399
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU $150,000,
BUT I WANT 15%.

00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:37,401
HEY, SHOULD WE GO...

00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:38,736
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR THE OFFER.

00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:41,538
WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
BUT THEY DON'T NEED IT.

00:40:41,538 --> 00:40:44,375
NO. WE'D ACTUALLY LIKE TO
JUST -- IF YOU DON'T MIND --
BARBARA, I'M SORRY,
WE'RE HERE -- WE'RE HERE

00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:45,743
WITH TRUE INTENTIONS.
YOU SAID YOU WANTED
A STRATEGIC PARTNER.

00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:48,612
AND TO ME,
I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED.

00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:51,515
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN HAVE
ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD,

00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:53,617
BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE
THE RIGHT CONNECTIONS

00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:56,353
AND YOU DON'T HAVE
THE RIGHT STRATEGIC PARTNER,

00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:58,522
YOU COULD GET IN A FEW STORES
AND THEN FIZZLE.

00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:01,592
ROBERT, IS --

00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:03,460
I-I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
I KNOW WHERE YOU STAND.

00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:07,631
LOOK, YOU -- YOU CAN'T ARGUE
WITH SALES.

00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,667
HALF A MILLION IN SALES
IN 10 MONTHS,

00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:12,403
I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR.
THANK YOU.

00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:13,504
O'Leary: ROBERT,
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:15,306
DO YOU WANT TO
INVEST IN THIS OR NOT?

00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,779
I'LL GIVE YOU $150,000
FOR 10%.

00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:27,418
HE JUST CUT YOUR VALUATION
IN HALF.

00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:28,519
WELL,
IT'S BETTER THAN LORI'S.

00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,587
I PERSONALLY THINK

00:41:30,587 --> 00:41:33,390
THAT YOU NEED TV,
YOU NEED QVC.

00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:35,426
I THINK WE CAN TAKE THIS
TO THE TOP.

00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:36,760
QVC,
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO LORI,

00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,330
IS ONE AVENUE. IT'S FANTASTIC.
I'M IN WALMART.
I'M IN HOME DEPOT.

00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,532
I'M IN WALGREENS.
I'M IN EVERYWHERE, EVERY MAJOR.
BUT SHE-- SHE'S GIVING YOU...

00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:43,801
BED BATH --
...AN UNDER-A-MILLION-DOLLAR
VALUATION.

00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:47,604
YOU HAVE TWO OFFERS.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:58,482
LORI, WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU
JOIN OUR FRESHNESS FAMILY.

00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:00,551
CHA-CHING!
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:02,586
YAY.
WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:04,555
I LIKE IT.
I THINK THIS IS GONNA BLOW UP.

00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:05,723
THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
LORI.

00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:07,358
I REALLY DO.
WE APPRECIATE IT.

00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,659
ROBERT, REALLY APPRECIATE
YOUR OFFER.

00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:09,660
Ben:
THANK YOU GUYS FOR YOUR TIME.
GOOD LUCK.

00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:13,697
TO BE RICH KIDS,
YOU HAVE TO BE RICH.

00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,566
WE'RE NOT RICH,
SO RIGHT OFF THE BAT,

00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:17,334
THAT'S AN UNFAIR
CHARACTERIZATION

00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:19,703
OF HOW THEY MADE IT OUT TO BE
BECAUSE OF OUR FATHER'S SUCCESS.

00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,372
NOW, <i>WILL</i> WE BE RICH?

00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,607
I THINK WITH LORI ON BOARD,
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:26,477
BUT UNTIL THEN, I'D HOLD OFF
ON CALLING US RICH KIDS.
