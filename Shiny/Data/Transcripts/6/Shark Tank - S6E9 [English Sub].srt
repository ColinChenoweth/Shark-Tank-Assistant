AND YOU'RE ASKING HIM
IF HE'S A MIND READER,

00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:49,069
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHEN
YOU GET FLUSTERED IN A SITUATION

00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:52,072
WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO SELL
A HOMEOWNER OR A BUILDER.

00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:54,441
I DON'T TRUST YOU
IN TERMS OF YOUR SALES ABILITY.

00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:57,210
AND FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.

00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,381
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO, LORI?

00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:03,350
Greiner:
WELL, LET ME TELL YOU --

00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:07,187
I THINK THAT IT'S
A REALLY SMART PRODUCT.

00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:08,288
THANK YOU.

00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:10,123
BUT, FOR ME,
I'M VERY CONCERNED

00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:13,093
WITH HOW YOUR SALES
JUST COMPLETELY DROPPED.

00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,029
I'M SORRY. I'M OUT.

00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,231
WOW.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,266
I APPRECIATE
YOUR CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM.

00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,434
THANK YOU.

00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,103
GOOD LUCK, JOHN.

00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,975
I'M WITH YOU, LORI. I THOUGHT
IT WAS A GREAT PRODUCT.

00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,043
A REALLY SMART PRODUCT.

00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:32,078
IT HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE PRODUCT.

00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,247
IF I HAD ONE THING
TO DO OVER AGAIN,

00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,316
I WOULD HAVE
LEFT THE TABLE OUT.

00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,394
I'M JEN.
AND I'M JEFF.

00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,162
AND WE'RE BROTHER AND SISTER
FROM BROOKLYN, NEW YORK.

00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:50,430
REALLY?
SINCE WE WERE KIDS,

00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,132
WE'VE ALWAYS HAD
A BUSINESS TOGETHER.

00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:53,266
WE WOULD SELL TOYS
IN THE STREET,

00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:54,300
EVEN POPCORN
IN THE STREET.

00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,102
THEN AS WE KIND OF GREW UP
INTO HIGH SCHOOL,

00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:59,105
WE BECAME BEST FRIENDS
AND HAVE SINCE BEEN INSEPARABLE.

00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,007
JEFF, TRY THIS.

00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,308
ONE DAY, JEFF WAS HELPING ME
MOVE APARTMENTS,

00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:04,177
AND WE HAD NOTHING TO EAT
BUT WERE STARVING.

00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:06,980
SO, I HAD A FEW INGREDIENTS
FROM A HEALTH-FOODS STORE.

00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,248
WE STARTED MAKING IT,
AND IT WAS AMAZING.

00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:09,282
SO GOOD.

00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:10,450
WE KNEW WE WERE
ONTO SOMETHING BIG.

00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,186
THAT'S WHEN THE IDEA OF OUR
COMPANY POPPED INTO OUR MINDS.

00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:14,988
WE SHOULD TRY THAT.
YEAH, WE SHOULD.

00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:16,322
Jen: OUR PRODUCT IS A SPIN
ON SOMETHING

00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,124
THAT EVERYONE'S HAD
FOREVER,

00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,393
BUT WE'VE MANAGED TO MAKE IT NEW
AND EXCITING AGAIN.

00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:24,998
IT'S HEALTHY, GLUTEN-FREE,
VEGAN, AND COMPLETELY DELICIOUS.

00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:28,435
STARTING A BUSINESS IN NEW YORK
ISN'T ALWAYS THE EASIEST.

00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:32,405
WE'RE WORKING FULL-TIME AT
IT AND BARELY MAKING ENDS MEET.

00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,040
Jeff: WE NEED
AN INVESTMENT FROM A SHARK

00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,041
TO REALLY GET TO
THE NEXT LEVEL.

00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,076
WE HAVE A GREAT PRODUCT.

00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,277
WE JUST DON'T HAVE
THE MANUFACTURING

00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,045
OR THE DISTRIBUTION
TO GET IT OUT THERE.

00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:40,146
[ LAUGHS ]

00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:41,448
WE'VE TAKEN
OUR LITTLE FAMILY COMPANY

00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:43,216
AS FAR AS WE CAN
ON OUR OWN,

00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:46,219
AND WE'VE LITERALLY GIVEN UP
EVERYTHING TO TAKE IT THIS FAR.

00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:48,388
WE JUST REALLY HOPE
THAT ONE OF THE SHARKS LOVES IT

00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:51,124
AS MUCH AS WE DO
BECAUSE IT'S EVERYTHING TO US.

00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:12,278
HI, SHARKS, I'M JEN,
AND THIS MY BIG BROTHER, JEFF.

00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,980
WE'RE FROM
BROOKLYN, NEW YORK,

00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,982
AND WE'RE ASKING
FOR $200,000

00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,051
FOR 10% OF OUR COMPANY,
PIPSNACKS.

00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:20,253
JEN AND I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
ENTREPRENEURS.

00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:21,387
AS KIDS,
INSTEAD OF LEMONADE,

00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,057
WE WOULD SELL POPCORN
OUT IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE.

00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:25,358
FAST-FORWARD 20 YEARS,

00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:28,428
AND WE'RE ALL STILL MUNCHING ON
THAT SAME POPCORN UNTIL NOW.

00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:30,430
I WAS WORKING AT
A HEALTH-FOODS STORE,

00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,133
AND I NEVER THOUGHT
THAT POPCORN COULD GET BETTER,

00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:36,035
BUT A FARMER INTRODUCED ME
TO THIS SPECIAL VARIETY OF CORN.

00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,337
I TOOK IT HOME
AND POPPED IT,

00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:40,206
AND IT WAS THE MOST AMAZING
POPCORN I'VE EVER HAD.

00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,008
IT COMPLETELY
ROCKED MY WORLD,

00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,077
SO I IMMEDIATELY SHARED IT
WITH MY BROTHER.

00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:46,045
AND NOT LONG AFTER,
PIPCORN WAS BORN.

00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,948
PIPCORN'S DELICIOUS,
ALL-NATURAL,

00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:51,384
AND YOU GUESS IT -- MINI.

00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,219
Greiner: OH!
[ LAUGHS ]

00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:54,254
EVEN BETTER,
THE SHELLS ARE

00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:56,022
MUCH, MUCH, MUCH SMALLER
AND MORE DELICATE.

00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,091
SO, SAY GOODBYE
TO THOSE THICK, HARD PIECES

00:10:58,091 --> 00:10:59,192
THAT GET STUCK
IN YOUR TEETH.

00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:01,294
NOW, BEFORE WE GET
TOO FAR ALONG,

00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,062
LET'S GET TO THE REAL BUSINESS
AND HAND SOME OUT.

00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,230
AND AS WE ALWAYS SAY...

00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,398
Both: PIP-PIP HOORAY!

00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,368
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:11,371
SO, SHARKS, OUR FLAVORS ARE
SEA SALT, ROSEMARY...

00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:13,239
YES.
Herjavec: SEA SALT.

00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,275
...KETTLE, AND EVERYONE'S
FAVORITE -- WHITE TRUFFLE.

00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:17,076
SO, THE TRUFFLE'S ALL-NATURAL
TRUFFLE, THE REAL STUFF.

00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,344
Jen: HERE YOU GO.
THANK YOU.

00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,247
THE ROSEMARY -- WE MAKE
ALL OF OUR ROSEMARY SEA SALT.

00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,049
IT'S REALLY GREAT.

00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,384
THIS IS REALLY GOOD.
SEA SALT'S MY FAVORITE.

00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:25,418
I EAT IT
ALMOST EVERY SINGLE DAY.

00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:26,419
I LOVE IT.
I LIKE IT.

00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,087
Cuban: KETTLE'S GOOD.
Jen: THANK YOU.

00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:31,157
EVERYTHING'S VEGAN AND
GLUTEN-FREE, ORGANIC, NON-GMO.

00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,425
REALLY?
YEAH.

00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,260
AND WE POP IT
IN OLIVE OIL.

00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,230
CAN I GO TO THE FARMER MYSELF
AND BUY MY OWN KERNELS FROM HIM?

00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,998
WHAT DO I NEED YOU FOR?

00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:41,000
YOU CAN, BUT WE'RE
ACTUALLY GROWING SO QUICKLY

00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,335
THAT WE'RE
REALLY CLOSE TO SIGNING

00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:43,436
A TOTAL-EXCLUSIVE
FOR POPPING.

00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:46,039
SO, WE'VE ACTUALLY GROWN 125%
IN SALES SINCE JANUARY.

00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,174
IS HE THE ONLY FARMER THAT CAN
GROW THIS SMALL POPCORN?

00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:49,242
NO, HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE,

00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:51,010
BUT WE HAVE ABOUT TWO AND HALF
YEARS OF EXPERIENCE.

00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,245
WE HAVE TWO AND A HALF YEARS
OF KIND OF LEEWAY,

00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:54,080
BUILDING A BRAND,
BUILDING A PRODUCT.

00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,448
RIGHT, SO,
TELL US ABOUT THE REVENUE.
TELL US ABOUT WHERE YOU SELL.

00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:58,318
LAST YEAR,
WE SOLD $200,000 AND...

00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:01,020
THAT WAS ONLY
IN ABOUT 40 STORES.

00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,055
WHAT KIND OF STORES?

00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,323
WE'RE IN 18 WHOLE FOODS
CURRENTLY.

00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:05,358
HOW MUCH DOES IT SELL FOR?

00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:06,426
$4.99.

00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:08,161
WHAT'S YOUR COST ON IT?

00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:09,429
OUR IS A $1.80 AVERAGE.

00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,064
THE TRUFFLE'S
THE MOST EXPENSIVE.

00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,365
THAT'S EXPENSIVE.
$1.80'S EXPENSIVE.

00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:14,033
IT'S EXPENSIVE,
BUT, YOU KNOW,

00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:15,301
WE'RE DOING ALL
THE MANUFACTURING OURSELVES.

00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,003
SO, TO TAKE IT BACK
A LITTLE BIT,

00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:19,105
WE LAUNCHED IN APRIL OF 2012,
AND ONE MONTH INTO THE JOB,

00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:21,074
WE CAUGHT
THE ATTENTION OF OPRAH.

00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,042
WE WERE FEATURED ON HER
"FAVORITE THINGS" IN NOVEMBER.

00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,177
WOW.

00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:26,045
SO WE WERE FORCED
TO REALLY SCALE-UP VERY QUICKLY,

00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:28,982
BUT WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING
WITH A CO-PACKER

00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:31,050
TO OUTSOURCE
99% OF IT,

00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,285
AND THAT WILL DOUBLE
OUR MARGINS.

00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:35,021
WHAT WILL IT COST YOU AFTER
YOU'VE SCALE WITH THE CO-PACKER?

00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:36,456
AROUND 92 CENTS,
AVERAGE.

00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:39,158
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE IN PRICE
BETWEEN THIS BAG

00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:42,095
AND A TRADITIONAL POPCORN BAG
BESIDE IT?

00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,229
IT DEPENDS ON
WHERE YOU'RE BUYING.

00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,365
IF YOU'RE BUYING STORE BRAND,
IT'S A $1.99.

00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:47,367
THIS IS $5,
AND THAT STUFF IS $2.

00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:52,005
Herjavec:
SO, JEFF, I LOVE POPCORN.

00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:54,240
BESIDES NOT GETTING
STUCK IN YOUR TEETH,

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,409
TELL THE VALUE-ADD
OF SMALL POPCORN.

00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:57,977
JEN CAN'T EAT POPCORN.

00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:59,078
IT KILLS HER STOMACH.

00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,247
SHE ACTUALLY HAS
A COUPLE DIETARY RESTRICTIONS.

00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,383
PREVENTS HER
FROM EATING A LOT OF THINGS.

00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:05,385
SHE FOUND THIS KERNEL
WORKING AT A HEALTH-FOODS STORE,

00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:06,419
AND SHE COULD EAT.

00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:08,054
IT'S WAY EASIER TO DIGEST.

00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:09,422
IT'S SMALLER, IT'S CUTE,

00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:11,157
IT'S ALSO --
THERE ARE SOME HEALTH BENEFITS.

00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,425
IT'S MUCH HIGHER IN FIBER
THAN ORDINARY POPCORN.

00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:14,160
HOW DO WE MAKE MONEY IS WHAT
I WANT TO KNOW BECAUSE YOU --

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,261
SO, ONCE WE GO TO
THE CO-PACKER --

00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,330
YOU SAID
$200,000 FOR 10%, RIGHT?

00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,398
YEAH, $2 MILLION VALUE.

00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:20,033
THAT'S AN ACCUMULATED VALUE
OF $2 MILLION...

00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:21,301
CORRECT.
...AND IT'S POPCORN.

00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,969
CORRECT.

00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,238
HOW DO I GET MY $200,000 BACK
IF I'M A 10% SHAREHOLDER?

00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:27,340
SO, YEAR TO DATE,
WE'VE DONE $150,000 IN SALES.

00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,175
WE'RE GROWING --
SINCE JANUARY, WE GROWN 124%.

00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,410
YOU'VE MADE NO MONEY,
RIGHT?

00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,345
NOT CURRENTLY,
BUT BY THE END OF THE YEAR,

00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:34,080
WE'RE PROJECTED
TO MAKE $40,000.

00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,281
ISN'T AMAZING I KNOW THAT?
WHY DO I KNOW THAT?

00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:36,449
BECAUSE WE'RE
A SMALL MANUFACTURER,

00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:38,084
AND -- AND THAT'S THE WAY IT IS
IN THE BEGINNING.

00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:41,421
BUT YOU THINK THIS IS --
IDEA IS WORTH $2 MILLION?

00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:42,322
OH, ABSOLUTELY.
WELL --

00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,190
OKAY, EXPLAIN WHY.

00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,291
WE'RE GONNA
FINISH THE YEAR

00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,026
AT JUST AROUND $440,000
IN SALES,

00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,027
AND THAT'S IN 65 STORES.

00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,129
AS SOON AS WE GET
A CO-PACKER --

00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,165
CUT OUR COSTS
ALMOST MORE THAN HALF --

00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:55,168
THEN WE'LL BE ABLE TO
REALLY PUSH IT OUT, MAKE MONEY,

00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,369
AND THEN WE CAN GO TO THE ENTIRE
REGION OF WHOLE FOODS.

00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:57,970
IT'S VERY SIMPLE --

00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,138
THERE'S NOTHING PROPRIETARY
ABOUT THE SEED.

00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,973
OH, MY GOD.
HERE WE GO. HERE WE GO.

00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,408
WAIT, WAIT -- HEAR ME OUT.
IT'S A BROKEN RECORD.

00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:05,311
AND I LOOK AT YOU, AND I SAY,
"IF I HAD $2 MILLION --

00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,214
"A BAG WITH $2 MILLION IN IT
RIGHT HERE --

00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:11,084
"COULD I FIND
A SISTER AND A BROTHER

00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:12,285
WHO WOULD COME
AND WORK FOR ME?"

00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:14,187

THAT EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU

EVERY DAY OF YOUR LIVES,

YOU KNOW,
THERE'S VERY FEW PEOPLE

THAT REALIZE
THAT THE TOILET

00:21:19,717 --> 00:21:21,719
AND THE SITTING POSITION
THAT IT PUTS YOU IN

00:21:21,719 --> 00:21:24,822
PLAYS A BIG PART IN A LOT
OF THE COLON ISSUES THAT WE HAVE

00:21:24,822 --> 00:21:26,657
SUCH AS CONSTIPATION.

00:21:27,925 --> 00:21:28,993

FORMING A KINK.

AND WHEN WE'RE
SITTING ON THE TOILET,

00:21:38,603 --> 00:21:39,737
THIS KINK
ONLY PARTIALLY RELAXES.

00:21:40,772 --> 00:21:43,941
AND ONLY WHEN WE ARE
IN A SQUAT POSITION,

00:21:43,941 --> 00:21:45,910
DOES THIS MUSCLE
COMPLETELY RELAX

00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,612
AND ALLOW US TO HAVE

00:21:47,612 --> 00:21:49,614
A COMPLETE AND FULL ELIMINATION
OF OUR WASTE.

THE OTHER ISSUE IS THE 10%

00:28:02,887 --> 00:28:05,823
AND THE VALUE OF THAT
IN A YEAR OR TWO YEARS.

00:28:05,823 --> 00:28:07,658

OF YOUR MOUTH, RIGHT?

THE COMPANY GOING,

IT'S WORTH $7 MILLION.

TRULY DID VALUE THAT,

WE'RE ALREADY TO $7 MILLION."

00:40:28,798 --> 00:40:29,966
THAT YOU WANTED TO TEACH
ABOUT BUSINESS,

00:40:29,966 --> 00:40:32,836
YOU HAD THEM SET UP A LEMONADE
STAND IN THE FRONT YARD.

00:40:32,836 --> 00:40:33,837
NOW YOU WATCH
"SHARK TANK."

00:40:33,837 --> 00:40:35,038
IT JUST SENDS THE MESSAGE

00:40:35,038 --> 00:40:36,806
THAT THE AMERICAN DREAM
IS ALIVE AND WELL.

00:40:36,806 --> 00:40:38,675
I'M HERE BECAUSE
I'M A PRODUCT

00:40:38,675 --> 00:40:40,043
OF A SERIES OF MENTORS
THROUGHOUT MY LIFE.

00:40:40,043 --> 00:40:42,612
IT STARTED OUT WITH MY MOTHER.
SHE'S STILL MY MENTOR.

00:40:42,612 --> 00:40:44,848
BUT THEN I HAD GREAT PARTNERS
AND GREAT FRIENDS,

00:40:44,848 --> 00:40:47,984
AND I'M EXCITED ABOUT WHAT WE DO
FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS.

00:40:47,984 --> 00:40:50,820
AND IN RETURN, IN A GREEDY WAY,
WE SUCCEED, AS WELL.

00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,956
THE TWO MOST SATISFYING ACTS
IN THE UNIVERSE

00:40:52,956 --> 00:40:55,992
IS HAVING KIDS AND RAISING THEM
AND BUILDING A BUSINESS.

00:40:55,992 --> 00:40:58,662
AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT,
IT'S THE SAME THING.

00:40:58,662 --> 00:41:00,630
EVERY DAY,
I COME OUT HERE, HONESTLY,

00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:03,767
I FEEL DEEPLY HUMBLED
AND HONORED --

00:41:03,767 --> 00:41:05,902
NOT JUST TO BE WITH YOU GUYS,
BUT TO BE ON THIS SHOW.

00:41:05,902 --> 00:41:08,772
YOU KNOW, A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
STILL DON'T BELIEVE,

00:41:08,772 --> 00:41:10,640
EVEN MY FRIENDS,
HOW REAL THE SHOW IS

00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,708
UNTIL THEY COME
AND WATCH IT.

00:41:11,708 --> 00:41:13,977
THEY STILL THINK,
"YOU MUST GET LINES,"

00:41:13,977 --> 00:41:15,712
"IS IT REALLY
YOUR OWN MONEY?"

00:41:15,712 --> 00:41:17,614
John: YOU KNOW, WHEN PEOPLE SAY,
"WELL, THAT'S NOT REALITY.

00:41:17,614 --> 00:41:18,982
YOU WOULDN'T NEGOTIATE
AGAINST FIVE PEOPLE."

00:41:18,982 --> 00:41:20,850
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHEN YOU'RE OUT SHOPPING A DEAL,

00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,686
YOU'RE NEGOTIATING
WITH 5, 10 PEOPLE.

00:41:22,686 --> 00:41:23,853
IT'S JUST IN SEPARATE ROOMS.

00:41:23,853 --> 00:41:26,790
NOW WE GET TO SEE
WHO BIDS AGAINST EACH OTHER,

00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:28,658
AND WE GET TO
GO AT EACH OTHER.

00:41:28,658 --> 00:41:32,028
THE BOTTOM LINE IS WHETHER
YOU ARE A MOM, A DAD, A KID,

00:41:32,028 --> 00:41:34,864
A IMMIGRANT,
YOU WALK ONTO THAT CARPET,

00:41:34,864 --> 00:41:37,734
AND BEING AN ENTREPRENEUR
IS THE ULTIMATE EQUALIZER,

00:41:37,734 --> 00:41:39,069
AND EVERYBODY HAS A SHOT.

00:41:39,069 --> 00:41:40,770
HALLELUJAH.

00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:41,838
OH, LOOK AT THIS!
Corcoran: WHAT'S THIS?

00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:43,640
HEY. WOW.
WOW.

00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,608
HEY!

00:41:44,608 --> 00:41:46,876
KEVIN, YOU'RE 100.
CONGRATULATIONS.

00:41:46,876 --> 00:41:47,777
[ LAUGHTER ]
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:41:47,777 --> 00:41:48,845
WOW.
LET'S OPEN IT UP.

00:41:48,845 --> 00:41:50,714
BIG ENOUGH.
GIVE US CHAMPAGNE,
KEVIN.

00:41:50,714 --> 00:41:53,617
100 EPISODES. YEAH.

00:41:53,617 --> 00:41:54,884
WELL, WE HAVE TO HAVE
A TOAST, GUYS.

00:41:54,884 --> 00:41:57,020
IT'S THE 100th EPISODE
OF "SHARK TANK."

00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,822
LET'S HAVE ANOTHER 100.

00:41:58,822 --> 00:42:00,924
YOU KNOW,
CHAMPAGNE IS A GREAT STORY.

00:42:00,924 --> 00:42:01,925
[ CORK POPS ]
PLEASE.

00:42:01,925 --> 00:42:03,059
OH!
WHOO!

00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:04,861
WHOO-HOO!
THAT'S IT.

00:42:04,861 --> 00:42:06,863
ALWAYS TILT THE GLASS WHEN
THE CHAMPAGNE IS BEING POURED.

00:42:06,863 --> 00:42:08,798
IT'S HOW YOU RESPECT
THE VINTAGE.

00:42:08,798 --> 00:42:10,600
Cuban: IS FROM THE
WHAT SOCIETY -- THE DU TASTEVIN?

00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,935
DU LE --
CHEVALIERS DU TASTEVIN?

00:42:11,935 --> 00:42:13,903
[ LAUGHTER ]
NO.

00:42:13,903 --> 00:42:15,739
LET ME SHOW YOU
HOW THE TOAST IS DONE.

00:42:15,739 --> 00:42:17,874
TO OUR 100th EPISODE.
HOLD YOUR PINKY OUT LIKE THAT.

00:42:17,874 --> 00:42:19,576
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHY NOT?

00:42:19,576 --> 00:42:20,644
CHEERS.
All: CHEERS.

00:42:20,644 --> 00:42:21,645
TO ANOTHER 100.

00:42:21,645 --> 00:42:23,847
HEY, HEY!
Herjavec: CHEERS!
