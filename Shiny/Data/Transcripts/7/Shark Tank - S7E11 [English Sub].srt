00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:10,970
Rose:
SO, WE WERE TRAVELING IN ASIA,

00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:14,440
AND WE CAME ACROSS THIS ART FORM
OF SLICEFORM KIRIGAMI.

00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,008
YEAH.
Rose:
AND WE FELL IN LOVE.

00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:19,111
WE WERE JUST LIKE, "OH, MY GOD,
THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS."

00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,313
SO, WE CAME BACK.
WE STARTED DESIGNING CARDS.

00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:22,948
WE STARTED SELLING CARDS
TO PEOPLE.

00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,017
Herjavec: JOHN, YOU JUST
GRADUATED THREE WEEKS AGO.

00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:26,786
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
RUNNING THE BUSINESS?

00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,921
SO, IT'S BEEN A YEAR AND A HALF
ENTIRELY WHILE IN SCHOOL.

00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:30,756
AND WHAT ARE YOUR SALES
IN THAT YEAR AND A HALF?

00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,858
$300,000.

00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:35,828
BUT IF IT'S AN ARTISAN BUSINESS
AND YOU GUYS ARE HARVARD GRADS,

00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:37,696
DID YOU EVER TEST
PRICE SENSITIVITY?

00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:40,399
BECAUSE WHY WOULDN'T THIS --
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING.

00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:41,967

00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,779

00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:56,115

00:21:57,383 --> 00:21:59,485

PRODUCTION FACILITY OVERSEAS.

00:22:04,223 --> 00:22:07,660

00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,595

00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:11,831

THE REVENUE WILL BE?

00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:22,308
SO, IT'LL BE
ABOUT $240,000.

00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:23,843
PER KIOSK?
PER KIOSK.

00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,344
AND WHAT WOULD BE THE PROFIT
ON THAT?

00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,513
IT'S GONNA BE
ABOUT $40,000.

00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:30,216
AND WHAT PERCENTAGE
OF A KIOSK PERSON

00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:33,219
GOES TO THE WEBSITE
AND BUYS MORE PRODUCT?

00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:34,920
SO, WE TESTED THIS
FOR A MONTH AND A HALF,

00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,023

THAT, IN TURN, CREATES A BRAND
FOR YOU THROUGH THEIR AWARENESS.

00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:04,383
AND --

00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,886
SO, WHAT IS THE CAPITAL COST
FOR EACH KIOSK?

00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:10,256
IT TAKES AROUND $20,000 FLAT
TO OPEN A KIOSK.

00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:12,057
CAN I TELL YOU WHAT I DON'T LIKE
ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS,

00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,425

TALKING, I GOT ALL EXCITED.

00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:23,502
ARE PRETTY HAPPY MAKING
$200,000 A MONTH ON ONE TRUCK.

00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:27,039
