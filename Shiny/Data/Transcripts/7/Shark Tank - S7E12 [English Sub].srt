00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,889
RIGHT.
BUT BODY BUILDERS
AND PEOPLE WHO COMPETE,

THEY'RE NOT --
THEY'RE NOT PRICE CONSCIOUS,

00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,792
IS BASICALLY
WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO.
CORRECT.

00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,028
LOOK, GUYS, WHAT YOU'VE DONE
IS AMAZING SO FAR.

00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:37,497
YOU DESERVE A LOT OF CREDIT,
AND YOU'RE MAKING MONEY.

00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,499
THE PROBLEM IS,
YOU'RE NOT A COMPANY YET.

00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:40,834
YOU'RE A PRODUCT
THAT YOU HUSTLE.

00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:43,970

I'M OUT.

00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,506
OKAY.

YOU KNOW, BIG CHALLENGE --

00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,378

THIS COMPANY?

00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:52,846
YEAH,
BIG CHALLENGE WOULD BE --

00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:55,181
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T
THINK YOU CAME IN HERE RE--

00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,317
NECESSARILY ASKING
FOR AN UNREASONABLE VALUATION.

00:06:57,317 --> 00:07:00,320
WHERE YOU'RE AT RIGHT NOW,
I CAN SEE IT.

00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,556
I JUST GOT SHOCKED
WHEN I HEARD $42.

00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:04,858
MM-HMM.

00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:07,227
I JUST FIND IT CHALLENGING
TO -- TO GO TO --

00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:10,030
AT $42 FOR THE PANCAKES,
IT'S PRETTY EXPENSIVE.

00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:13,033
UH, AND I JUST DON'T KNOW
IF YOU CAN LAST AT THAT LEVEL,

00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,768
SO, UH, I'M OUT.

00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:17,938

YOU GUYS LOOK GREAT.

00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,808
THANK YOU.

00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,243

00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:26,012
BEING HEALTHY AND LOOKING BETTER
AND ALL OF THAT,

00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:30,951
BUT I PERSONALLY DIDN'T LIKE
THE FLAVOR OF IT.

00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:34,487
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO REALLY
LOVE WHAT I GET BEHIND,

00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,756

00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,967
I THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW,
MARK AND I DID NUTS 'N MORE,

00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,402
AND WE'VE DONE VERY WELL
WITH THAT.

00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:52,272
AND SINCE THEN, I'VE DONE
A BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS

00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:53,707
IN THE FITNESS CATEGORY,

00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:56,109
SO WE'VE NAVIGATED
OUR WAY THROUGH THAT.

00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:58,378
UM...I THINK
YOUR PRICE IS TOO HIGH.

00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:00,780
BUT I LOVE
THE PACKAGING, ESPECIALLY.

00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,881
I MEAN, IT'S GREAT.

00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,083
AND I COULD SEE
A PRODUCT EXTENSION...

00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,286
...CUPCAKE MIX
AND OTHER THINGS.

00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:08,154
I DON'T KNOW WHY,
MAYBE IT'S THE PACKAGE,

00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,223
BUT I'M IN A REALLY
SHARKY MOOD TODAY.

00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:14,260

00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,667
YOU OFFERED 40%,
I WENT UP TO 50%.

00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:23,703
IT'S HIS MONEY.

LET ME MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU

TO MAKE A DECISION.

00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,310
I'M OUT.

00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,546
I DON'T GET THIS.
THIS STUFF TASTES LIKE CRAP.

00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,181
I DON'T GET IT.

00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:11,885
NOTHING AGAINST YOU, BUT...

00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,053
YUCK.

00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,254
IT'S LIKE EATING CARDBOARD.

00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:16,389
I FINISHED MINE, SO --
BY THE WAY, I LIKED THEM.

00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,490
I LIKED THEM.

00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,359
YOU EITHER UNDERSTAND
THE FITNESS BENEFITS

00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,393
OR YOU DON'T.

00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,028
I LOOK AT
THE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY

00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,431
AS A DISCIPLINED
FINANCIAL INVESTOR, ROBERT...
WELL...

00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:26,633
...AND SAY THAT THIS IS
A VERY SMALL, VERTICAL MARKET.

00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:28,935
KEVIN, YOU HAVE TO -- YOU HAVE
TO UNDERSTAND THE INDUSTRY.

00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,437
YOU ARE DEFINITELY
THE "BEFORE"...

00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:32,305
[ LAUGHS ]
...AND I'M DEFINITELY
THE "AFTER."

00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,707
YOU MAY SAY THAT,
BUT I'M TRYING TO MAKE MONEY.

00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,276
ME TOO.
AND I THINK THIS IS

00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:39,379

I BELIEVE
I'M THE ONLY OFFER.

00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:50,390
ROBERT, ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO DO THAT?

00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,225

YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS HERS.

00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:00,500

TO DO JUST AS MUCH WORK.

PHENOMENA IN SEASON SEVEN

ON "SHARK TANK."

THAT BELIEVES IN YOU...

AT 50/50 --

A LOT OF NOISE AND CHATTER.

YOU GO 49%,

A FIGHT WITH HIM AT 50/50...

00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:18,118

...IT CAN POTENTIALLY
BOTTLENECK THE COMPANY FOREVER.

00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,252

IS ROBERT RIGHT NOW.

IT TASTES LIKE CRAP.

TO RUN YOUR BUSINESS.

00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:09,287
WE MAKE THIS FOR $45.

00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:10,589
DANG.
WOW.

00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:12,190
TELL ME A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT THE VALUE.

00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:15,160
YOU'RE SAYING IT'S WORTH
ROUGHLY $4.5 MILLION TODAY.

00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,995
YEAH.
HOW DID YOU
COME UP WITH THAT?

00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,498
SO, I KNOW WE'RE GONNA HIT
AT LEAST $2 MILLION THIS YEAR.

00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,399
HOW MUCH MONEY WOULD YOU MAKE
ON THE $2 MILLION?

00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:24,369
RIGHT NOW, THIS YEAR,
WE HAVE A 37% NET PROFIT.

00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:26,505
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE $750,000.

00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:27,472
YES.

00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:30,141
DAMN!
PETER, YOU ARE ON FIRE.

00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:32,511
HOW IS THE WORD GETTING OUT
THAT PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THIS?

00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,946
YEAH, SO, WE SELL DIRECT
TO MULTI-FAMILY HOUSING

00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:36,581
AND SENIOR-HOUSING FACILITIES.

00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:39,217
IF YOU CAN IMAGINE, THESE
MULTI-FAMILY-HOUSING OWNERS

00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:40,585
THAT ARE HAVING A STOVE FIRE

00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:42,420
ONCE A QUARTER
IN THEIR PORTFOLIO,

00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,755
IT'S A HUGE PAIN POINT FOR THEM,

00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:45,290
AND WE CAN SHOW
THEM THE SOLUTION.

00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,892
IT'S A NO-BRAINER FOR THEM.

00:33:46,892 --> 00:33:48,560
DO YOU OWN
THE COMPANY YOURSELF?

00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,661
I STARTED IT.

00:33:49,661 --> 00:33:51,196
I OWN JUST UNDER
30% OF THE COMPANY NOW.

00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:52,063
OHH.

00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:53,431
YOU OWN WHAT?

00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:54,666
WAIT, YOU OWN JUST 30%?

00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:55,467
CORRECT.
OH.

00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:56,701
WHO OWNS THE REST, PETER?

00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,671
SO, WHEN I HAD THE IDEA --
I'M A FIREFIGHTER, RIGHT?

00:33:59,671 --> 00:34:02,207
AND SO I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE THIS OUT.

00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:05,277
AND WE TOOK SOME EARLY FRIENDS,
TOOK SOME INVESTMENTS,

00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:06,611
THEY OWN A PART OF IT.

00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:08,847
PETER, WHO IS THE LARGEST
SHAREHOLDER OF YOUR COMPANY?

00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:10,348
IS IT YOU
OR ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS?

00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:11,550
ONE OF MY FRIENDS.

00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,319
HOW MUCH DOES YOUR FRIEND OWN,
A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL?

00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:17,055
UH, ONE OF THEM OWNS 60%.

00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,590
OHH.

00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:22,360
I NEEDED CASH, AND I WAS PAYING
FOR THE BUSINESS OUT OF POCKET.

00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,362
THE BUSINESS IS BURNING MONEY,
RIGHT?

00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:26,898
AND I WAS TO THE POINT
WHERE WE WERE PRE-SALES.

00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,099
I GOT FOUR KIDS,

00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:30,068
AND I WAS PUTTING MY MORTGAGE
ON A CREDIT CARD.

00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,803
I HAD PUT ALL MY SAVINGS
INTO IT.

00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:33,772
I -- I WAS STRESSING. I --

00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:34,773
YOU WERE STUCK.

00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:36,107
I FEEL LIKE HE SAVED ME.

00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:38,810
THAT'S FINE. YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T THINK HE SAVED YOU.

00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,613
AT LEAST FROM MY PERSPECTIVE,
IF YOU WATCH THE SHOW A LOT,

00:34:41,613 --> 00:34:43,848
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN ME
TRY TO GET 50% OR 51%.

00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:45,951
AND THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT --
BECAUSE I THINK

00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:48,920
THE ENTREPRENEUR HAS TO HAVE
ENOUGH STAKE IN THE GAME.

00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,923
OTHERWISE, THERE'LL BE A POINT
OF DIMINISHING RETURNS

00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,959
WHERE YOU QUESTION
WHETHER OR NOT IT'S WORTH IT,

00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:55,527
OR YOU'LL LOOK
TO DO SOMETHING ELSE

00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:56,962
BECAUSE
YOU'RE AN ENTREPRENEUR.

00:34:56,962 --> 00:35:00,165
AND SO I THINK THAT'S
GONNA BE AN ISSUE HERE,

00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:02,667
AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.

00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:04,035
THANK YOU, MARK.

00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:06,137
THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE,
YOU BECOME AN ENTREPRENEUR

00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:07,772
TO SAVE LIVES
AS WELL AS MAKE MONEY.

00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:11,142
BUT, UH, YOU KNOW, GIVING AWAY,
UM, 70% OF YOUR COMPANY

00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:14,713
AT THE EARLY STAGES, NOW YOU
HAVE LIMITED TO PLAY WITH.

00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:16,915
AND, UH, YOU KNOW,
I THINK THAT I WOULD MAKE IT

00:35:16,915 --> 00:35:18,083
JUST MORE PRESSURE ON YOU.

00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:20,585
SO FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.

00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:22,220
THANK YOU, DAYMOND.

00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,489
Greiner: WELL, LISTEN.
I AGREE WITH DAYMOND.

00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:25,824
YOU WERE IN A CIRCUMSTANCE

00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:27,859
WHERE YOU GAVE AWAY A LOT
FOR A LITTLE.

00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:29,694
BUT YOU WERE STUCK,
SO YOU DID IT.

00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:31,363
NOW YOU'RE IN
A POSITION AGAIN

00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:33,732
WHERE YOU'RE GIVING AWAY
MORE OF YOUR COMPANY, RIGHT?

00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:36,501
SO, I-I PERSONALLY FEEL

00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:39,571
THAT I DON'T WANT TO TAKE
MORE OF YOUR COMPANY.

00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:42,107
I DON'T FEEL RIGHT
ABOUT IT.

00:35:42,107 --> 00:35:44,409
GOOD LUCK.
BUT RIGHT NOW, I'M OUT.

00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:49,114
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE
REALLY SMALL, YOU GOT TO HANG ON

00:35:49,114 --> 00:35:51,383
TO AS MUCH EQUITY
AS LONG AS YOU CAN.

00:35:51,383 --> 00:35:53,318
I WANT TO GET INVOLVED,
BUT 5%, 7%,

00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:54,452
JUST NOT THAT INTERESTED.

00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:55,620
SO, MAKE AN OFFER.

00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,122
TELL ME WHAT YOU GUYS THINK
IT WOULD BE WORTH

00:35:57,122 --> 00:35:58,923
FOR YOU GUYS GETTING UP
AND BEING PART OF THIS COMPANY.

00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:00,425
I BELIEVE IN THIS PRODUCT.

00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:02,360
I FEEL THAT THIS IS GONNA BE
IN EVERY HOME ACROSS AMERICA.

00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,695
WE ALL BELIEVE IN THIS,
WE JUST DON'T --

00:36:03,695 --> 00:36:05,130
IT'S NOT A QUESTION
ABOUT THE PRODUCT.
YEAH.

00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,231
THE PRODUCT
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

00:36:06,231 --> 00:36:07,699
IT'S THE DEAL.
WE ALL LIKE THE PRODUCT.

00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:09,401
OKAY, HOW ABOUT --
SO, WHAT -- WHAT DEAL
MAKES SENSE?

00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:10,602
PETER,
HOW ABOUT THIS DEAL?
IS THERE...

00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:11,736
HOW ABOUT THIS DEAL?

00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:14,606
I BUY OUT YOUR FRIEND'S 60%
FOR $300,000

00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:17,676
AND GIVE YOU
51% VOTING CONTROL.

00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,611
HE'S GONE.
I'LL BE THE 60% GUY.

00:36:33,258 --> 00:36:34,726
Narrator: THREE SHARKS ARE OUT.

00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:37,128
EVERYONE IS CONCERNED
PETER GAVE AWAY TOO MUCH

00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:39,297
OF HIS FIRE-PREVENTION COMPANY,
FireAvert,

00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:40,865
TO A PREVIOUS INVESTOR.

00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,268
BUT KEVIN HAS
A UNIQUE PROPOSITION.

00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:44,502
O'Leary:
HOW ABOUT THIS DEAL?

00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:47,372
I BUY OUT YOUR FRIEND'S 60%
FOR $300,000

00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:50,108
AND GIVE YOU
51% VOTING CONTROL.

00:36:50,108 --> 00:36:53,578
I'LL GIVE YOU, IN MY DEAL --
I'LL TAKE OUT YOUR FRIEND.

00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:55,747
I SIT IN HIS SHOES.
I NOW HAVE 60%.

00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:57,549
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO CONTROL YOUR COMPANY.

00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,217
John: SO, HIS FRIEND
IS GONNA SAY, "WAIT A MINUTE.

00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:02,520
WE'RE GONNA CLEAR $750,000,"
UH, YOU KNOW --

00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,822
THAT HE OWNS 60% OF,
RIGHT?

00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:05,223
YEAH, YOUR FRIEND IS NOT GONNA
BE A FRIEND ANYMORE.

00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,891
John: I OWN 60% OF THAT.
YEAH, BUT HIS FRIEND
RIGHT NOW --

00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,693
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT YOU THINK.

00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:11,229
WITH THIS FRIEND, ALSO, HE'S
A VERY STRATEGIC PARTNER, TOO.

00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,230
Cuban: WHAT'S HIS NAME?

00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,398
UH, JEFF.

00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,533
HE'S A MULTI-FAMILY-HOUSING
OWNER HIMSELF,

00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:17,936
AND SO HE'S BEEN ABLE
TO -- TO OPEN DOORS FOR ME.

00:37:17,936 --> 00:37:19,104
HE'S VERY STRATEGIC.

00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:21,139
HE'S GOT ME
SO MUCH NETWORKING OUT THERE.

00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:22,741
BUT YOU DO UNDERSTAND
HE OWNS 60%

00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,576
SO THAT HE CAN MAKE
THE FINAL DECISION?

00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,211
WHY ARE WE EVEN
TALKING ABOUT THIS

00:37:26,211 --> 00:37:28,379
WHEN JEFF ISN'T HERE
AND HE CAN'T SELL JEFF OUT?

00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:30,048
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.
WELL, IT'S GONNA BE
A CONTINGENCY.

00:37:30,048 --> 00:37:31,483
I'M ASKING.
IT'LL BE A CONTINGENCY.

00:37:31,483 --> 00:37:33,818
BECAUSE WHAT IT GETS YOU BACK
IS CONTROL OF YOUR COMPANY.

00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:35,587
I'M -- I AM YOUR FRIEND.
THAT'S WHY I'M --

00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:37,355
WHY WOULD JEFF SELL OUT 60%
FOR $300,000?

00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:39,324
MAYBE HE WANTS
LIQUIDITY.

00:37:39,324 --> 00:37:40,692
HOW MUCH DID HE SPEND?

00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:41,593
$50,000.

00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,962
WOW.
WOW.

00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:45,964
O'Leary: HE GAVE YOU $50,000.

00:37:45,964 --> 00:37:50,935
I'M NOW OFFERING HIM $300,000
FOR HIS $50,000.

00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,203
TOTAL LIQUIDITY.

00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:54,239
WHY DON'T YOU JUST CALL HIM?
LET'S FIND OUT.

00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:55,507
PETER, I'LL MAKE YOU
A BETTER OFFER THAN KEVIN

00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:57,008
ON THE SAME TERMS.

00:37:57,008 --> 00:38:00,411
I'LL GIVE YOU $400,000
FOR THAT 60%,

00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:02,781
AND I'LL GIVE YOU BACK
THE VOTING RIGHTS, ALSO.

00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:04,616
I DON'T NEED
TO RUN YOUR BUSINESS.

00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:07,152
I'LL GIVE YOU
VOTING CONTROL.

00:38:07,152 --> 00:38:09,954
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S GO CALL JEFF.

00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:12,357
I'M GONNA TALK TO JEFF.

00:38:12,357 --> 00:38:13,324
LET'S DO IT.

00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:16,361
♪♪

00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,696
JEFF?
THIS IS MARK CUBAN.

00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:20,498
I'M HERE WITH PETER.
SAY HI, PETER.

00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:21,666
HEY, JEFF. HOW ARE YOU?

00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,201
JEFF: Good. Hey, Peter.
Hey, Mark.

00:38:23,201 --> 00:38:25,537
THE QUESTION
THAT WE ALL HAD WAS,

00:38:25,537 --> 00:38:28,239
WITH PETER ONLY HAVING
30% LEFT,

00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,441
IT MADE IT A LITTLE BIT
DIFFICULT FOR US TO INVEST

00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:33,044
BECAUSE HE'D BE DILUTED,
AND WE WERE CONCERNED

00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:35,313
WITH THE AMOUNT OF EQUITY
HE'D HAVE AFTER A DEAL.

00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,982
WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO SELL
ANY OF YOUR EQUITY

00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:41,419
DIRECTLY AS PART OF THIS DEAL
SO THAT THE MONEY WENT TO YOU

00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:44,189
SO THAT PETER WOULD BE ABLE
TO RETAIN HIS EQUITY?

00:38:44,189 --> 00:38:46,057
REALLY WHAT IT'S COME DOWN TO,
THERE'S KEVIN

00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:49,260
AND, UM, ROBERT ARE LOOKING
AT MAKING OFFERS.

00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:54,432
KEVIN'S OFFER WAS $300,000
TO BUY YOUR EQUITY DIRECTLY,

00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:58,169
AND THE SECOND OPTION WAS
FROM ROBERT, HE'D GIVE $400,000.

00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:01,172
I know Robert and Kevin are
obviously accomplished guys,

00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,208
but I highly doubt they would be

00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:05,643
more strategic in this business
than I am.

00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:09,113
I'M GONNA LET YOU TALK
TO, UM, PETER,

00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:10,415
AND LET YOU GUYS
FIGURE IT OUT

00:39:10,415 --> 00:39:12,083
AND DECIDE IF YOU WANT
TO COUNTER OR NOT.

00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,318
Sounds good.

00:39:13,318 --> 00:39:14,552
THANK YOU.

00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:15,353
Thanks.

00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:18,823
I THINK IT IS CRAZY
THEY WANT TO OFFER

00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:21,626
$300,000, $400,000
FOR ALL YOUR EQUITY.

00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:22,827
Well, don't let
the bright lights

00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:24,229
have us do a dumb deal.

00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:25,563
Herjavec:
SO, WHAT DID YOU LEARN?

00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:26,931
DOES HE WANT
TO SELL HIS POSITION?

00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:28,833
THAT'S WHAT
THEY'RE DISCUSSING.

00:39:30,902 --> 00:39:34,539
OKAY, PETER, BEFORE YOU START,
JUST TO SUMMARIZE HERE

00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:37,709
SO I AM CLEAR ON WHAT
THE SITUATION IS WITH JEFF --

00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:41,246
HE GAVE YOU $50,000
AND GOT 60% OF THE COMPANY.

00:39:41,246 --> 00:39:42,780
THOSE ARE THE FACTS.

00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:47,518
I'LL BUY JEFF'S POSITION,
THE ENTIRE 60%, FOR $300,000.

00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:49,654
IS HE INTERESTED
IN DOING THAT?

00:39:49,654 --> 00:39:53,591
JEFF SAID HE WILL NOT SELL
HIS FULL EQUITY FOR $300,000.

00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:57,829
HE WANTS TO STAY IN THE GAME.
WE WANT TO DILUTE EQUALLY.

00:39:57,829 --> 00:39:59,530
SO, HE'S NOT OPPOSED
TO DILUTING,

00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,466
BUT HE WON'T SELL
ANY OF HIS SHARES DIRECTLY.

00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:02,567
YES.

00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,569
I HAVE ZERO INTEREST IN THAT.
I'M OUT.

00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,106
IF THAT'S THE CASE,
I'M OUT, TOO.

00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:13,645
LORI, I WISH YOU WERE STILL IN,
BECAUSE I THINK --

00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:15,780
I THINK WE CAN SELL
A LOT OF THESE ON QVC.

00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,548
THERE IS A HUGE MARKET OUT THERE

00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:19,951
FOR PEOPLE BUYING THESE
FOR THEIR PARENTS,

00:40:19,951 --> 00:40:22,887
THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT
THEIR PARENTS AGING AND PLACE.

00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:25,023
I TOLD YOU MY COST RIGHT NOW
IS $45.

00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:28,726
I KNOW FOR A FACT WE CAN GET
THE COST OF THIS DOWN TO $20.

00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:30,395
AND THEN WHAT
WOULD YOU SELL IT FOR?

00:40:30,395 --> 00:40:34,699
WE COULD SALE THIS RETAIL
FOR $99 ON QVC OR OTHER PLACES.

00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:36,234
WHAT ARE YOU OFFERING ME?
SO -- SO, LORI --

00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:38,169
YOU CAME BACK IN HERE,
AND YOU LOOKED AT ME.
YEAH.

00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:40,438
[ LAUGHS ]
WHAT'S YOUR OFFER TO ME?

00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,073
LORI --
I'M INTERESTED.

00:40:42,073 --> 00:40:44,842
SO, $300,000 --
WHAT ABOUT $300,000 FOR 12%?

00:40:46,678 --> 00:40:49,247
I WOULD DO IT THIS WAY
INSTEAD.

00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:51,916
THIS IS BASED ON THAT
YOU GET THE UNIT PRICE DOWN.

00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:56,721
I WOULD GO $300,000 AS A LOAN,
5% INTEREST.

00:40:56,721 --> 00:41:00,158
JUST GIVE ME 15% ROYALTY
UNTIL I'M PAID BACK.

00:41:00,158 --> 00:41:03,061
AND THEN,
WHEN I GOT BACK MY $300,000,

00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:05,163
I WOULD HAVE
THE 12% STAKE.

00:41:05,163 --> 00:41:08,599
O'Leary: I CAN BEAT THAT OFFER
IN A BIG WAY.

00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:12,170
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $300,000,
ALSO AS A LOAN,

00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:17,241
I'LL TAKE A 10% ROYALTY
UNTIL I'M PAID BACK $900,000.

00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:19,844
MY ROYALTY GOES AWAY.
UNTIL $900,000.

00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:23,147
AND I ONLY WANT --
I ONLY WANT 5% OF YOUR EQUITY.

00:41:26,718 --> 00:41:31,656
LORI, $300,000, 10% ROYALTY
UNTIL YOU'RE PAID BACK,

00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:33,591
AND THEN YOU OWN 10% EQUITY.

00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:37,428
WE'RE GONNA DO
$2 MILLION THIS YEAR.

00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:39,163
WE'VE ALREADY DONE $1.5 MILLION.

00:41:43,468 --> 00:41:45,636
$300,000 LOAN.

00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:50,575
10% ROYALTY
UNTIL I'M PAID BACK $400,000.

00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:52,243
THEN THE ROYALTY ENDS,

00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:55,213
AND THEN I HAVE 10% EQUITY
STAKE IN THE COMPANY.

00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,021
DEAL.

00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:04,122
OH, MY GOD!

00:42:04,122 --> 00:42:05,256
OKAY.

00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:06,290
WHOO-HOO!

00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:07,725
WHOO-HOO!
THAT WAS A SWITCHEROO, BOY.

00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:09,560
THAT WENT AROUND
QUITE A BIT, RIGHT?

00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,595
OH, MY GOD.

00:42:10,595 --> 00:42:11,963
CONGRATULATIONS, PETER.

00:42:11,963 --> 00:42:13,097
THANK YOU. YEP.

00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:14,465
WOW.

00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:16,667
Thorpe: THIS DEAL MEANS
EVERYTHING TO MY FAMILY.

00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:18,669
AND GIVING UP THAT MUCH
EQUITY IN THE BEGINNING

00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:19,871
I STILL STAND BEHIND.

00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:21,973
WITH LORI'S NETWORK
AND MARKETING ABILITIES

00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:24,308
TO GET THIS OUT TO THE MASSES
AND BUILD AWARENESS

00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:26,444
IS WHY I WANTED
TO WORK WITH HER.
