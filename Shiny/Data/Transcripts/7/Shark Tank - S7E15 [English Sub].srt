THESE PACKS APART

THOUSANDS OF DIGITAL FILES

BEEN DOING THIS?
OH, COOL.

00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,250
WE STARTED THIS BUSINESS
ABOUT SEVEN MONTHS AGO,

00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,270
BUT WE HAVE BEEN
IN THE PACK INDUSTRY
FOR ABOUT SIX YEARS.

00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,200
Lorenzen: WE HAVE AN EXISTING
PACK COMPANY.

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,280
IT'S AN OUTDOOR TECHNICAL BRAND
CALLED MHM.

00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,200
DOES THAT COMPANY
STILL EXIST?

00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,200
THAT COMPANY DOES STILL EXIST.
IT DOES, YEAH.

00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,200
HOW BIG IS IT?

00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,020
LAST YEAR'S SALES
WERE $450,000.

00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:48,150
IN TOTAL, WE'VE DONE
$1.2 MILLION WITH THAT BRAND.
YEAH.

00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,220
AND IS IT A DESIGNED PACK?

00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,170
I'M ASSUMING
IT'S NOT SMART PACK.

00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,170
IT'S NOT.
IT'S -- NO.

00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,200
IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT
INDUSTRY.

00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,200
WE MADE THIS A SEPARATE BRAND
BECAUSE WE WANTED --

00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,210
IT WAS A TOTALLY
DIFFERENT CUSTOMER.

00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,020
AND WE WANTED TO REACH
ON THE OTHER SIDE.

00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:02,200
SO I'M INVESTING ONLY IN THIS,
NOT THE OTHER COMPANY.

00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,280
-JUST FOR CO.ALITION.
-WE SET THAT UP FOR CO.ALITION.

00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,240
IS THERE ANYTHING PROPRIETARY
ABOUT IT? DO YOU HAVE A PATENT?

00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,290
NO, THERE IS NO PATENT ON THIS.
THERE IS NO PATENT, NO.

00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:11,270
SO, BASICALLY, ANYBODY CAN PUT
A CHARGER AND A DRIVE IN A BAG.

00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,050
Cuban: YEAH, THERE'S PLENTY OF
PORTABLE DRIVES THAT ARE SMALL,

00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:18,010

NOTHING?

00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,280
NO, THE DIFFERENCE IS

00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,020
OUR CHARGING SYSTEM
IS ACTUALLY COMPUTERIZED.

00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,220
A LOT OF THESE OTHER MOBILE
BATTERIES YOU FIND AREN'T.

00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,250
WHAT'S UNIQUE?

00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,280
SO, IT ACTUALLY HAS
A COMPUTER CHIP IN IT

00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,030
THAT REGULATES
POWERING OUT OF THE BAG.

00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,000
THE DIFFERENCE IS, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO REMOVE OUR SYSTEM.

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,230
THOSE OTHER SYSTEMS, RESEARCH
SHOWS PEOPLE USE THEM AT FIRST

00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,160
AND THEN GRADUALLY
STOP USING THEM.

ALMOST 500 BAGS IN 7 MONTHS.

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,190
SO, HOW MUCH DO EACH ONE
OF THESE BAGS COST?

00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:52,190
IT RANGES ANYWHERE
FROM $180 TO $600 RETAIL.

00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,020
Herjavec:
AND WHAT'S YOUR PROFIT?

00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,180
OUR PROFIT RANGE
IS ANYWHERE FROM 50% TO 70%.

00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,250
-SO, JEFF, YOU'VE SOLD 500 BAGS.
-YES.

00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,240
WHAT WAS YOUR TOTAL REVENUE
ON THAT?

00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,200
OUR TOTAL REVENUE
IS ABOUT $100,000.

00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,270
AND HOW DO PEOPLE FIND YOU?

00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,190
YOU KNOW, WE'RE MAINLY SET UP
TO BE DIRECT SALES ONLINE.

00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,190
-SO IT'S ALL ONLINE.
-YEAH.

00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,210
YEAH,
WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY MONEY

00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,250
TO PUT INTO MARKETING
OR ADVERTISING.

00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,210
ALL OF THAT
HAS BEEN WORD OF MOUTH.

00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,250
BUT WHAT'S THE VISION?
BESIDES --

00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,000
VISION IS WHAT WE BRING
TO THE TABLE.

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,060
NO, NO, BUT HOW DO YOU SEE IT
BECOMING BIG?

00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,210
HOW DO YOU --
BECAUSE THIS IS A --
THIS IS A GLOBAL PRODUCT.

00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,230
WE ACTUALLY GOT THE IDEA

00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,080
WHEN WE WERE IN JAPAN
ON A BUSINESS TRIP.

00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,250
WE WERE ON A TRAIN,
AND WE NOTICED EVERY
SINGLE PERSON WE SAW

00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,270
HAD A MOBILE DEVICE
OF SOME SORT AND A BAG.

00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:31,170
AND THIS WORKS ACROSS THE BOARD
FOR PEOPLE TO USE.

00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,130
I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU.

00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,050
I MEAN,
I KNOW WHAT THE GUYS ARE SAYING.
YOU CAN GO BUY ALL THAT STUFF.

00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:37,010
BUT PEOPLE ARE LAZY.
THEY'RE NOT GONNA DO THAT.

00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,240
YEAH, IT'S NOT INTEGRATED WELL.
I LOVE THE CONVENIENCE.

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,020
I PLUG MY PHONE IN.
I'M GOOD TO GO.
MM-HMM.

00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,270

REALLY, REALLY TINY.

00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,280
-YEAH.
-YEAH.

00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,010
HOW ARE YOU GONNA MAKE IT
REALLY BIG?

00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,290
WHAT'S THE --
WHAT'S THE GO-TO-MARKET PLAN?

00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:50,290
I-I FEEL LIKE THIS PRODUCT ISN'T
BEST FOR TRADITIONAL RETAIL.

00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:52,080
BECAUSE
IT'S SO DEMONSTRABLE,

00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,030
IT'S HARD TO GET RETAIL STAFF
TO BE ABLE TO REALLY --

00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,280
SO YOU'RE GONNA PUMP MONEY
INTO GOING ONLINE.

00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,290
YEAH.
DIRECT SALES.

00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,030
YEAH, WE REALLY WANT
TO OPTIMIZE OUR WEBSITE.

00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,020
YOU KNOW,
WE'RE STEPPING INTO AN ARENA

00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,130
WHERE EVERYONE'S BEEN IN
BUSINESS FOR, LIKE, 30 YEARS.

00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,020
SO --

00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,290
AND IT'S A COMMODITY.
YEAH, IT'S A VERY -- YEAH.

00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,220
AND IN A PRETTY NICHE MARKET.
IT'S A VERY COMPETITIVE MARKET.

00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,290
YEAH, YEAH.

00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,260
SO, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE OF OUR
DESIGN, WE HAVE A FRESH OUTLOOK.

00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,280
WE'RE MUCH YOUNGER,

00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,290

THAN ALL THESE COMPANIES

00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,260

OVER TIME.

00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,220

AND SAY TO A PRIVATE LABELER,
"COPY THIS BAG,"

00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:26,240
AND THEN THEY CAN HIRE FIVE KIDS
AT $50,000 A YEAR...

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,290
MM-HMM.
...WHO KNOWS EVERYTHING

00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,020
ON SOCIAL MEDIA
AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,290
AND THEY CAN PRODUCE
THESE BAGS.

00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,270
ALL THOSE ARE TRUE WORDS,
ACTUALLY.

00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:35,280
YEAH, SO WHY WOULD YOU
VALUE THIS AT $1 MILLION?

00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,030

A DIFFERENT QUESTION.

IF YOU'RE SO GOOD
WITH YOUR OTHER COMPANY --

00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,290
YOU'VE GROWN IT
TO $450,000 IN SALES --

00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:48,280
WHY TAKE AWAY
ANY ATTENTION FROM IT?

00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,070
THAT SCARES THE HELL OUT OF ME.

00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,280
-RIGHT.
-RIGHT?
-BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A NICHE --

00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,210
I MEAN,
IF YOU'RE THAT GOOD, GRIND.
YEAH.

$5 MILLION.

WHAT'S KEEPING YOU
FROM GETTING THERE?

00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:01,230

THE GLOBAL POSSIBILITY

00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,220
ON THE NEW YORK
STOCK EXCHANGE IN 2009.

00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,270

TO INVENT THINGS.

JUST CRAWL INSIDE THAT THING,

ON OURSELVES.

00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:04,270
TO HELP OTHER STUDENTS PREPARE
THE WAY I DID IN HIGH SCHOOL.

00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:08,130
MANY OF OUR STUDENTS HAVE BEEN
ADMITTED TO IVY-LEAGUE SCHOOLS,

00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:10,120
HAVE WON MILLIONS
IN COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIPS,

00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,170
AND SOME HAVE EVEN GOTTEN

00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:13,250
PERFECT S.A.T. SCORES
THEMSELVES.

00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:17,200
NOW, 2400 EXPERT IS LOOKING
TO EXPAND ACROSS THE NATION.

00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,150
SO, SHARKS, WHO'S READY TO
SCORE BIG OFF MY PERFECT SCORE?

00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:23,060
WOW.
THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:23,435
THANK YOU.

00:33:23,435 --> 00:33:26,150
TELL US HOW IT WORKS.
IT'S A SIX-WEEK COURSE.

00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:28,250
AND UP UNTIL
JUST ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO,

00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:32,250
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN IN-PERSON,
CLASSROOM-STYLE IN LAS VEGAS.

00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:36,110
WE JUST STARTED OFFERING
ONLINE COURSES SIX MONTHS AGO.

00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,140
THOSE ARE ACTUALLY
STARTING TO BRING IN

00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,120
MORE REVENUE THAN EVEN
THE IN-PERSON COURSES.

00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,230
WHAT'S THE REVENUE TODAY?

00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:43,210
SO, WE'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS
FOR ABOUT FOUR YEARS,

00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:46,100
AND WE'VE DONE
$1.2 MILLION IN SALES.

00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,150
WOW.
THAT'S IN
THE TOTAL PERIOD, RIGHT?

00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,170
THAT'S IN THE TOTAL PERIOD,

00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,250
BUT WHAT'S REALLY EXCITING
ABOUT THAT IS

00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,220
PRETTY MUCH EVERY YEAR,
WE'VE DOUBLED REVENUE,

00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:56,200
SO ABOUT HALF OF
THAT $1.2 MILLION
CAME JUST LAST YEAR,

00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,250
BASED ON LAS VEGAS
IN-PERSON COURSES.

00:33:57,250 --> 00:34:00,160
SO, SHAAN, HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS.
YEAH?

00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,000
I KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT
THE TEST-PREP MARKET.

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,130
OKAY.
I WAS A SHAREHOLDER IN KAPLAN
AND THE PRINCETON REVIEW.

00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:06,200
THERE WE GO. YEAH.
BOTH OF THEM.

00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,260
TELL ME, WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO ACQUIRE A STUDENT?

00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:13,220
SO, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,
WE DON'T HAVE GREAT ANALYTICS

00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,200
ON THE CUSTOMER-ACQUISITION
COST.

00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,200
BUT WHAT I CAN TELL YOU

00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,250
IS PRETTY MUCH
ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS

00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:21,230
COME FROM WORD OF MOUTH,
SO IT'S PARENTS AND STUDENTS

00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:23,250
WHO HAVE HEARD
ABOUT OUR SCORE IMPROVEMENTS.

00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:25,180
I GET THAT
FOR THE LAS VEGAS MARKET.
YEAH.

00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,190
BUT IF YOU
WANT TO SCALE THIS

00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,260
AND COMPETE WITH THE BIG BOYS
IN TEST PREP,

00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,280
YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT
THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION,

00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,170
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
THEY SPEND ALL THEIR TIME DOING.

00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,270
YES.
NO, NO, I AGREE WITH YOU.

00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:36,190
AND WE'RE DEFINITELY
WORKING ON THAT RIGHT NOW.

00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:38,090
SHAAN,
WHAT DOES THE COURSE COST?

00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,220
SO, THE IN-PERSON COURSE
COSTS --

00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:42,170
FOR A 60-HOUR COURSE
COSTS $999.

00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:44,220
SO, THAT COMES OUT
TO ABOUT $17 PER HOUR.

00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,230
AND WHAT IS THE COST
ONLINE?

00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:49,200
ONLINE, IT'S $599
FOR THOSE 60 HOURS,

00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,250
SO UNDER $10 AN HOUR.

00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,250
SO, ON THE 600,000 SALES
LAST YEAR,

00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,200
HOW MUCH MONEY
DID YOU MAKE?

00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,250
WE MADE ABOUT $220,000.

00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:58,150
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THAT
IS ONLINE CURRICULUM?

00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:00,150
WE JUST STARTED
6 MONTHS AGO ONLINE,

00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:02,210
SO ABOUT 40%
IS NOW BRINGING ONLINE.

00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,240
SO NOW WE HAVE STUDENTS
ENROLLING

00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,170
FROM CHINA, INDIA, LONDON --
AND IS ONLINE LIVE?

00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,240
WILL YOU STILL HAVE
AN INSTRUCTOR,

00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,240
OR IS ONLINE RECORDED
AND PACKAGED?

00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,240
YEAH, SO I'M PRETTY MUCH
THE FACE OF THE COMPANY.

00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,240
AND A LOT OF STUDENTS
WANT TO TAKE COURSES WITH ME,

00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:17,220
SO I TEACH ONE COURSE A WEEK
FOR ONLINE.

00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:20,140
SO I'LL TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT MY BACKGROUND.

00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,190
SURE.

00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:25,070
I'M CURRENTLY AN MD/MBA STUDENT
AT BOTH U.S.C. AND YALE.

00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:25,468
WOW.

00:35:25,468 --> 00:35:27,200
AND THE REASON
THAT I AM WHERE I AM TODAY

00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,000
IS REALLY BECAUSE
OF MY S.A.T. SCORE.

00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,180
[ CHUCKLES ]
MY S.A.T. SCORE CHANGED MY LIFE.

00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,180
I GREW UP
IN MY PARENTS' BUDGET MOTEL.

00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,250
I WENT TO URBAN PUBLIC SCHOOLS

00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,220
IN THE WORST SCHOOL DISTRICT
IN THE NATION.

00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,180
BUT BECAUSE OF MY S.A.T. SCORE,

00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,280
I WAS ADMITTED
INTO PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITIES.

00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,000
I RECEIVED $500,000
IN SCHOLARSHIP OFFERS.

00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,150
I EVEN GOT TO MEET THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.

00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,270
O'Leary:
WHY DOES 2400 EXPERT

00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:50,170
GET THE INCREMENTAL STUDENT
THAT'S NEVER HEARD OF YOU?

00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:52,170
WE HAVE AN AVERAGE
S.A.T. SCORE IMPROVEMENT

00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:55,230
THAT'S INDUSTRY-LEADING --
376 POINTS IN 6 WEEKS.

00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:57,210
THAT'S COMPARED
TO OUR COMPETITORS,
WHO GET 50 TO 100.

00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:00,210
SO, THE PRODUCT'S GOOD
IS WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME.

00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:02,250
BUT HOW DO I LET THE --
THE PRODUCT'S GREAT, YEAH.

00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:05,220
HOW DO I LET THE WORLD KNOW
THAT YOU EVEN EXIST?

00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:08,220
BECAUSE THE WHOLE STRATEGY
OF THE S.A.T. MARKET

00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,230
IS CUSTOMER ACQUISITION --
IT'S THE WHOLE DEAL.

00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:13,220
OR, BETTER YET, WHAT ARE
YOU GONNA USE THE MONEY FOR?

00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,220
YES, SO,
THE MONEY IS GONNA BE USED

00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,240
TO OPEN A DOZEN NEW LOCATIONS.

00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:20,240
SO THE MARKETS
THAT I'VE SELECTED ARE NEW YORK,

00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,170
LOS ANGELES, SAN FRANCISCO,

00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:24,180
WASHINGTON D.C., PHILADELPHIA,
AND BOSTON.

00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:27,040
BUT NOW YOUR ONLINE OPERATION
IS YOU TEACHING LIVE.

00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,040
THAT'S ONE. WE COULD ALWAYS HAVE
OTHER INSTRUCTORS TEACHING LIVE.

00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,040
BUT WE HAVE ALSO
ENROLLED STUDENTS.
OKAY, BUT DOES IT NEED
TO BE LIVE ALL THE TIME?

00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,290
WHAT'S THAT?
OR COULD IT BE
PACKAGED CONTENT?

00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:35,270
-OH, SO THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.
-RIGHT.

00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:37,270
EVERYONE -- SO, OUR CUSTOMER
IS NOT THE HIGH-SCHOOL STUDENT.

00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:39,030
IT'S THE HIGH-SCHOOL PARENT.

00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,230
AND PARENTS DO NOT WANT
THE PRE-RECORDED ONLINE COURSE

00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:45,180
FOR THEIR HIGH-SCHOOL STUDENT
IN GENERAL.

00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,270
I'M CURRENTLY IN THE ONLINE
EDUCATIONAL SPACE.

00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:49,270
NOW, YOU BROUGHT UP
A VERY GOOD POINT --

00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:52,240
THE PARENTS ARE BUYING IT
AND MAKING SURE

00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,290
THAT THE KIDS THEMSELVES
TAKE IT,

00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:56,290
BUT THEY DON'T BELIEVE
THEY'RE GONNA GO AND SIT DOWN

00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:58,170
IN FRONT OF THE COMPUTER
EVERY DAY.

00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:01,030
YEAH.
BUT I DON'T SEE THE SCALABILITY

00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:04,260
IN REGARDS TO WHERE
I CAN HELP YOU WITH MY MODEL.

00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:07,200
MM-HMM.
I CAN'T TAKE THIS RIDE WITH YOU,
SO I'M OUT.

00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,170
THANK YOU, DAYMOND.
APPRECIATE THAT.

00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:10,250
DO YOU WANT TO
BE A DOCTOR?

00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,280
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,260
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO BE A DOCTOR.

00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,010
OR AN ENTREPRENEUR?
UH, THIS -- LOOK.

00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:17,260
I'VE -- SO I'VE ALWAYS
BEEN IN SCHOOL.

00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:20,010
I'VE ALWAYS -- SO, THAT'S A --
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN IN SCHOOL,

00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,270
BUT I'VE ALSO ALWAYS
BEEN AN ENTRE--

00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:23,170
SHAAN, I THINK YOU'RE DIGGING
YOURSELF A HOLE HERE.

00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:26,000
BECAUSE AN INVESTOR,
A SHARK INVESTOR,

00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,200
WANTS TO HEAR
THAT YOU'RE TOTALLY COMMITTED

00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,200
TO DOMINATING
THE TEST-PREP SPACE.
YEAH.

00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,130
AND IT HAS TO BE OOZING
FROM EVERY PORE.

00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:35,180
WE HAVE TO BELIEVE IT.

00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,240
♪♪

00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,140
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:50,160
Narrator: ONE SHARK IS OUT,
AND THE SHARKS QUESTION

00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,060
SHAAN'S COMMITMENT
TO HIS BUSINESS, 2400 EXPERT,

00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,100
AN S.A.T. PREP COURSE.

00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,030
DO YOU WANT TO
BE A DOCTOR?

00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:59,060
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,190
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO BE A DOCTOR.

00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:03,110
OR AN ENTREPRENEUR?
UH, THIS -- LOOK.

00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,120
YOU CAN'T BE
A PART-TIME ENTREPRENEUR.

00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,110
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE SOMEBODY
DRIVING THE BUSINESS.

00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,160
AND YOU HAVEN'T
ARTICULATED

00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,120
A STRATEGY
FOR CUSTOMER ACQUISITION.

00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:14,070
OKAY. SO I'LL GIVE YOU --
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXACT STRATEGY.

00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,170
SO, YES, I'M IN MEDICAL SCHOOL.

00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:18,120
I REALIZED IN MEDICAL SCHOOL
THAT MY BUSINESS WAS TAKING OFF.

00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,230
WE BARELY HAD ENOUGH STUDENTS
FOR THE FIRST COURSE.

00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,200
WHAT I'M DOING IS FOCUSING
ON MY BUSINESS TO SCALE IT.

00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,200
I'M TAKING AN EXTENDED SUMMER
JUST TO FOCUS ON MY BUSINESS.

00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,200
I THINK THAT THE ELECTRONIC
CONTENT IS REALLY IMPORTANT.

00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:32,100
I UNDERSTAND YOU SAY
THAT PEOPLE WON'T SIT AND DO IT,

00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,150
BUT I THINK
THAT IF YOU HAVE PARENTS

00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:35,100
AND YOU'RE A STUDENT
THAT REALLY CARES,

00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,180
EVEN IF JUST
A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE STICK,

00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:40,210
AND YOU CAN SELL A LOT
OF THE ELECTRONIC CONTENT,

00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:43,130
THEN THAT'S THE WAY
YOU'RE REALLY GONNA
DRIVE THIS BUSINESS.

00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:46,180
BUT I -- YOU KNOW, ENTREPRENEUR,
DOCTOR, YOU'RE NOT SURE.

00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:51,180
I DON'T SEE ME GIVING YOU
THE MONEY TO SUPPORT THIS.

00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:54,120
I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU KNOW WHICH
DIRECTION YOU WANT TO BE.

00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,200
I'M OUT.

00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,190
WELL, THANKS.
I APPRECIATE THAT.

00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:00,230
OKAY. UM,
LET ME TAKE A SHOT AT IT.

00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:02,170
I WOULD JUST LIKE TO MENTION
THAT I WOULD BE OPEN, KEVIN,

00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:04,180
TO A LICENSING DEAL
WITH PRINCETON REVIEW OR KAPLAN.

00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,170
IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD
BE INTERESTING TO ANY SHARK.

00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:07,240
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW
IF THEY DO THAT.

00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,140
THEY FEEL PRETTY CONFIDENT
ABOUT THEIR CONTENT.

00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,210
YEAH, NO, OF COURSE.
I WAS JUST THROWING IT OUT.

00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:13,170
Herjavec:
I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,240
I THINK YOU COULD SELL
A LOT OF IT.

00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:20,050
BUT MY CHALLENGE WITH IT IS
YOU'RE KIND OF PLAYING AT IT.

00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:21,090
YOU WANT TO BE A DOCTOR,

00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,240
AND YOU WANT TO BE
AN ENTREPRENEUR.

00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,170
AND THEN WHEN KEVIN ASKED YOU,
YOU SAID,

00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:27,190
"OH, I'D ALSO BE INTERESTED
IN MAYBE LICENSING IT."

00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:30,190
YOU KNOW, BUSINESS ISN'T THAT.
YOU CAN'T PLAY AT BUSINESS.

00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:32,170
WELL, I --
BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA
COME ACROSS A GUY

00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,220
WHO DOESN'T WANT
TO BE A DOCTOR,

00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:37,180
AND HE IS GOING TO
KICK YOUR BEHIND.

00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:41,080
I CAN'T INVEST
IN A PART-TIME ENTREPRENEUR.

00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,240
I'M OUT.

00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,230
THE GREAT THING
ABOUT THIS MARKET

00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:52,090
THAT I'VE KNOWN FOR YEARS,
IT'S RECESSION-PROOF.

00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,270
YEAH.
AND IT'S HUGE.

00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:58,200
YOUR BIGGEST PROBLEM, SHAAN,
IS YOU'RE NOT 110% COMMITTED.

00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:02,170
THE QUALITY OF ENTREPRENEUR
THAT GETS ON THAT CARPET

00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:04,210
HAS TO BE SO COMMITTED

00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:06,250
BEFORE THEY GET A CHECK
FROM A SHARK.
MM-HMM.

00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:10,150

00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:12,260

THEIR LIVES FOR IT.

00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:15,220

I WANT TO BACK.

00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:17,120

THAT KIND OF GENERAL.
