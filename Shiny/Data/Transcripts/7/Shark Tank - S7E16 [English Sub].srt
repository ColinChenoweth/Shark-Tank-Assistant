00:00:01,539 --> 00:00:02,599
Narrator: TONIGHT ON A SPECIAL
"SHARK TANK"...

00:00:02,599 --> 00:00:04,479
WE HONOR AMERICA'S
HEROIC VETERANS.

00:00:04,479 --> 00:00:06,449
MAJOR MOM IS HERE
TO SAVE THE DAY.

00:00:06,449 --> 00:00:07,690
Narrator:
IN THE TANK,

00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:09,680
ENTREPRENEURS
SEEK AN INVESTMENT

00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,590
TO START, GROW, OR SAVE
THEIR BUSINESSES.

00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,550
WE KNOW THAT BUSINESSES ARE MORE
POWERFUL THAN BULLETS.

00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:15,580
OOH RAH.

00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,550
Narrator: IF THE SHARKS
HEAR A GREAT IDEA...

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,560
THAT'S AMAZING.

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,670
...THEY'LL INVEST
THEIR OWN MONEY

00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,560
AND FIGHT EACH OTHER
FOR A DEAL.

00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,610
200K FOR 25%.

00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:24,730
SO, WE'RE SPLITTING IT
THREE WAYS.
NO.

00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,660
Narrator: BUT THE ENTREPRENEURS
MUST GET THE FULL AMOUNT

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,690
THEY'RE ASKING FOR, OR THEY'LL
WALK AWAY WITH NOTHING.

00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,530
THIS COMPANY IS SO MUCH MORE
THAN JUST A PRODUCT.

00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:34,670
WHY IS IT WORTH $10 MILLION?

00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,670
IN 15 MONTHS,
WE SOLD ABOUT 1,500 UNITS.

00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,640
HOW MUCH DID YOU SPEND
UP TO THAT POINT?

00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,660
IF I TOLD YOU,
I'D HAVE TO KILL YOU.

00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,760
Narrator:
WHO ARE THE SHARKS?

00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:49,700
THEY'RE SELF-MADE
BUSINESS EXPERTS WORTH BILLIONS.

00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,530
KEVIN O'LEARY IS
A SHREWD VENTURE CAPITALIST

00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,640
WHO MADE HIS FORTUNE

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,620
SELLING A CHILDREN'S
EDUCATIONAL COMPANY

00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,700
FOR OVER $4 BILLION.

00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,690
DAYMOND JOHN DOMINATED
THE FASHION WORLD WITH FUBU.

00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:06,550
NOW HE'S THE BRANDING EXPERT
BEHIND MULTIPLE GLOBAL BRANDS

00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,560
GENERATING BILLIONS IN SALES.

00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,540
ROBERT HERJAVEC, SON OF
AN IMMIGRANT FACTORY WORKER,

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,590
FOUNDED ONE OF

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,690
THE WORLD'S PREEMINENT
CYBER-SECURITY FIRMS.

00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:20,690
LORI GREINER, THE QUEEN OF QVC,
HOLDS OVER 100 PATENTS

00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,660
AND HAS LAUNCHED
MORE THAN 400 PRODUCTS,

00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,680
GROSSING OVER A HALF A BILLION
DOLLARS IN SALES.

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,590
AND MARK CUBAN,
ESTEEMED BILLIONAIRE TECH MOGUL

00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,590
AND THE OUTSPOKEN OWNER
OF THE DALLAS MAVERICKS.

00:01:41,061 --> 00:01:41,692
I'M LISA BRADLEY.

00:01:41,692 --> 00:01:42,700
AND I'M CAMERON CRUSE.

00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,640
AND WE'RE THE CO-FOUNDERS
OF R. RIVETER.

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,580
CAMERON AND I ARE BOTH
MILITARY SPOUSES.

00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,630
WE MET WHEN
WE WERE IN GEORGIA

00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,610
WHILE OUR HUSBANDS WERE
STATIONED WITH THE ARMY.

00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,590
BEING A MILITARY SPOUSE
CAN BE DIFFICULT.

00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,700
YOU MOVE ON AVERAGE
EVERY 2.9 YEARS,

00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,550
WHICH MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT
TO FIND A JOB

00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,640
OR BUILD A RéSUMé
TO BE PROUD OF.

00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,670
-HEY, GUYS.
-HEY.
-GOOD MORNING.

00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,700
A BIG PURPOSE BEHIND OUR COMPANY
IS EMPOWERING WOMEN.

00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,620
AND ACTUALLY WE NAMED OUR
COMPANY AFTER ROSIE THE RIVETER.

00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,610
SHE'S A WORLD WAR II ICON
THAT ENCOURAGED WOMEN

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,660
TO GO BACK
INTO THE WORKFORCE

00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,610
WHILE OUR MEN WERE SENT OFF
TO BATTLE.

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,560
HER MOTTO IS,
"WE CAN DO IT,"

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,680
AND THAT'S HOW WE FEEL
ABOUT OUR BUSINESS, TOO.

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,640
WE'RE SO EXCITED
TO GET THIS OUT TO YOU.

00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,620
UP UNTIL THIS POINT,
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GROW

00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,550
AND SCALE THIS COMPANY
BY OURSELVES.

00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,630
BUT WE ARE
AT A TURNING POINT,

00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,710
WHERE WE NEED
NOT ONLY CAPITAL

00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,570
BUT EXPERTISE TO GET US
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,640
GETTING A DEAL
FROM THE SHARKS

00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,630
MEANS THAT WE'D BE ABLE
TO SECURE THOSE JOBS

00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,720
AND VALIDATE THEIR HARD WORK
AND DEDICATION TO THIS COUNTRY.

00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,610
HI. I'M CAMERON CRUSE.

00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,650
AND I'M LISA BRADLEY.

00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,560
AND WE'RE THE CO-FOUNDERS
OF R. RIVETER,

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,560
A HANDBAG COMPANY
ON A MISSION.

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,570
WE ARE HERE
SEEKING $100,000

00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,550
FOR A 20% EQUITY STAKE
IN OUR COMPANY.

00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,570
AS MILITARY SPOUSES,

00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,600
ONE OF THE TOUGHEST ASPECTS
IS UNCERTAINTY.

00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,710
WHETHER THAT MEANS A DEPLOYMENT
OR RELOCATION,

00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,690
THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE JUST
OUT OF YOUR CONTROL.

00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,710
BECAUSE OF THIS, WE HAVE SET OUT
ON A MISSION

00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:11,650
TO EMPOWER AND CREATE MOBILE
INCOME FOR MILITARY SPOUSES.

00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,650
OUR HANDBAGS ARE MADE FROM
UPCYCLED MILITARY MATERIALS

00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,690
LIKE WOOL BLANKETS,
UNIFORMS, AND TENTS.

00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,570
EACH R. RIVETER HANDBAG
TELLS A STORY.

00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,620
LEATHER AND CANVAS IS CUT,
LINERS ARE SEWN

00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,630
ALL AT THE HANDS OF OUR NATION'S
MILITARY SPOUSES

00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,590
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,610
R. RIVETER IS ABOUT
EMPOWERING MILITARY SPOUSES

00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,700
AND REDEFINING THE BOUNDARIES
OF AMERICAN MANUFACTURING.

00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,620
SO, SHARKS, WHO WILL HELP US
GROW THIS COMPANY

00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,570
DEDICATED TO SERVING THE
FAMILIES WHO SERVE US ALL?

00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,600
WE'VE GOT SOME BAGS
WE'D LIKE TO PASS OUT.

00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,540
ROBERT,
WE'LL START WITH YOU.

00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,610
THAT IS
THE FINCH MESSENGER.

00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,540
15 MILITARY SPOUSES WENT
INTO MAKING THAT BAG.

00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,570
THANK YOU.

00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:45,640
LORI,
THE MRS. OTTO FOR YOU.

00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,630
THAT BAG TRAVELED
OVER 3,000 MILES

00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,620
ON ITS HANDMADE JOURNEY.
THANK YOU.

00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,550
KEVIN AND DAYMOND, YOU GET TWO
OF OUR BESTSELLERS,

00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,590
THE FINCH AND THE PATTON,

00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,610
BOTH MADE FROM AN UPCYCLED
MILITARY TENT.

00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,540
AND, MARK, YOURS IS MADE
FROM THE DRESS BLUE PANT

00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,781
OF A FIRST LIEUTENANT
IN THE ARMY.

00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:00,730
THAT'S COOL.

00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,710
SO, CAMERON, YOU SAID 15 PEOPLE
WENT INTO MAKING THIS.

00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:07,580
Cruse: YES. SO, MILITARY SPOUSES
MOVE ON EVERY 2.9 YEARS,

00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,580
AND THAT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT
TO FIND EMPLOYMENT,

00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,740
PUT DOWN ROOTS, AND HAVE
A COMMUNITY TO BE A PART OF.

00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,650
SO, WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS WE'VE
PROVIDED THE MOBILE EMPLOYMENT.

00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,580
SO, MILITARY SPOUSES
MAKE THE PARTS AND PIECES.

00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,650
LIKE THE "SUPPORT" TAG WAS DYED
IN COLORADO,

00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:19,730
THE LEATHER WAS CUT
IN GEORGIA,

00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:22,720
AND THE LINER WAS MADE
IN NEW YORK, AT FORT DRUM.

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,640
ALL THOSE PIECES COME TOGETHER
IN OUR SHOP IN NORTH CAROLINA,

00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,680
JUST OUTSIDE
OF FORT BRAGG.

00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,610
SO THEY ALL MAKE PARTS,
THEY SHIP IT TO YOU...

00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,570
AND WE ASSEMBLE AND READY
FOR RETAIL.

00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,610
AND SO WHAT'S THE TOTAL COST
OF THIS BAG,

00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,640
FOR YOU TO MAKE IT,
WITH EVERYTHING IN?

00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,610
$55 FOR THAT MRS. FINCH,
AND WE SELL IT FOR $220.

00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,640
AND WHERE DO YOU TRACK
THE STORY?

00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,710
SO IF I WANTED TO KNOW
THE STORY OF MY BAG...

00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,590
ALL OF THE PARTS AND PIECES
MADE BY EACH MILITARY SPOUSE

00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,660
ARE ACTUALLY STAMPED
WITH THEIR I.D.

00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,680
Bradley: YOU CAN GO AROUND,
AND YOU CAN FIND

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,710
THE INDIVIDUAL STAMP
OF EVERY MILITARY SPOUSE

00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,570
THAT PUT TIME AND EFFORT
INTO YOUR HANDBAG.

00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:53,670
Herjavec:
AND SO I GUESS ONE RIVETER

00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,560
WOULD HAVE MADE PORTIONS
OF EVERY BAG.

00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,630
CORRECT.
IS THAT RIGHT?

00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,540
Bradley: EXACTLY. RIGHT.

00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,570
EACH VENDOR STARTS
WITH HER PART,

00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:00,610
IN WHATEVER
SHE'S PROFICIENT IN,

00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,550
AND SHE TAKES HER JOB WITH HER
WHEREVER SHE GOES.

00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,680
SO THAT JOB IS GONNA
TRANSFER EVERYWHERE.

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,690
IS IT MOSTLY MILITARY PERSONNEL
BUYING THEM?

00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,680
A LOT OF IT IS.
RIGHT NOW OUR TARGET MARKET

00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,650
CONSISTS LARGELY OF
THE MILITARY SUPPORTER,

00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,600
BUT SOMEBODY
WHO REALLY UNDERSTANDS

00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,680
THAT THE POWER OF THEIR DOLLAR
IS INVESTING IN A COMMUNITY.

00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,570
HOW -- HOW ARE YOU -- HOW ARE
YOU REACHING OUT TO THEM?
HOW THEY BUYING THEM?

00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,620
RIGHT NOW WE'RE SELLING
60% ONLINE

00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,630
AND 40% IN OUR
BRICK-AND-MORTAR STORE.

00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,670
CAMERON, WHAT ARE THE SALES?

00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,530
ALMOST $300,000
IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS,

00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,530
$190,000 YEAR TO DATE.

00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,640
WOW. THAT'S REALLY GOOD.

00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,660
IF WE GET AN INVESTMENT,

00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,620
WE'RE EXPECTING $400,000
THIS YEAR.

00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,560
WHY? WHAT WILL
THE INVESTMENT DO

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,680
TO ACTUALLY CHANGE YOUR SALES
BY 25%?

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,630
WE BELIEVE THAT,
WITH AN INVESTMENT,

00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,610
WE CAN ACTUALLY PUT MONEY
INTO MARKETING.

00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,580
WE'VE ONLY PUT
$2,000 IN EACH.

00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,620
MY DAD PUT $5,000 IN.

00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,580
OTHER THAN THAT, WE'VE GROWN
THE COMPANY DOLLAR BY DOLLAR.

00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,530
SO YOU'VE INVESTED A TOTAL
OF $9,000.

00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,530
YES.

00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,650
WOW.
THANK YOU.

00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,600
Herjavec:
LISA, TELL US YOUR STORY.

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,570
TELL US YOUR BACKGROUND.
TELL US HOW YOU GOT TOGETHER.

00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,670
WELL,
WHEN I MET MY HUSBAND,

00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,670
IT WAS REALLY THE BEGINNING
OF THE END OF MY CAREER.

00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,620
I ACTUALLY MADE FOUR
CROSS-COUNTRY MOVES

00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,600
BY THE TIME I WAS 24.

00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,630
WOW.

00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,680
I DID GO
TO BUSINESS SCHOOL,

00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,650
BUT I DIDN'T GET TO START
MY CAREER.

00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,630
WE ACTUALLY MOVED TO GEORGIA,
AND THAT'S WHERE I MET CAMERON.

00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,570
OUR HUSBANDS WERE
RANGER INSTRUCTORS.

00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,560
YOUR HUSBANDS ARE RANGERS?

00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,590
YES.

00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,620
WOW. VERY IMPRESSIVE.

00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,690
AND THEN I HAVE A MASTER'S
IN ARCHITECTURE.

00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,590
GUYS, MOST --
MOST OF YOUR SALES --

00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:19,630
60% OF YOUR SALES ARE ONLINE,
RIGHT?

00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,690
YES.
YES, ABSOLUTELY.

00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,590
SO, TELL US ABOUT YOUR WEBSITE,
INCREASING YOUR TRAFFIC.

00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,690
SO, ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS
ARE SAYING

00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,580
THAT THEY'RE FINDING US
FROM SOME KIND OF NEWS MEDIA

00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,670
THAT WE'VE GOTTEN
OR WORD OF MOUTH.

00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:31,550
SO, HUGE, UNTAPPED MARKET
FOR US ONLINE.

00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,670
WE SEE A HUGE
POTENTIAL THERE,

00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,710
AND PART OF THE INVESTMENT
TODAY WOULD BE

00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,660
TO HOPEFULLY GO TOWARDS THAT
AND -- AND GROW THAT.

00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,690
ARE YOU GETTING ANY PUSHBACK
ON THE PRICE OF THESE BAGS?

00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,680
'CAUSE THEY ARE
PREMIUM-PRICED.

00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,620
I THINK OUR TARGET MARKET
UNDERSTANDS WHAT IT MEANS

00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,650
TO MAKE SOMETHING IN AMERICA
AND SELL IT

00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,630
AND BE ABLE TO MAKE MONEY
AND HELP MORE MILITARY SPOUSES.

00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,760
SO, DO YOU
SEND THEM TEMPLATES?

00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,630
YES.

00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,590
FOR EXAMPLE, LIKE,
"THIS MAKES THIS BAG."

00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,590
DO THEY HAVE A BOOK OF ALL
THE DIFFERENT STYLES?

00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,630
THEY DO.
YES, ABSOLUTELY.

00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,600
SO, WE TELL THEM HOW WE ACCEPT
THE PIECES,

00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,690
WHAT WE'RE GONNA BUY
FROM THEM,

00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,620
AND THEY MAKE IT
TO OUR STANDARD.

00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,650
I THINK THE BEAUTIFUL
THING ABOUT OUR HANDBAGS

00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:06,680
IS THE SIMPLICITY OF THEM.

00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,610
A MILITARY SPOUSE
CAN COME IN

00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,600
WITH NO SEWING EXPERIENCE
AND LEARN HOW.

00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,610
Cuban: WHAT'S REALLY, REALLY
COOL TO ME IS,

00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:15,710
YOU ARE A SOCIAL NETWORK
THROUGH ACTION, RIGHT?

00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,650
I MEAN, YOU COULD BE LITERALLY
THE FUTURE OF --

00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,650
OF MANUFACTURING,
IN SOME RESPECTS,

00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,690
FOR SPECIALTY MANUFACTURING.

00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:26,610
EVERYBODY WHO CONTRIBUTES HAS
PRIDE OF OWNERSHIP, RIGHT?

00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:27,700
SO THEY BECOME A SALES REP

00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,580
WITHOUT HAVING TO ACTUALLY
SELL THE BAG, RIGHT?

00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,620
"I HELPED BUILD THIS," RIGHT?
YEAH.

00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,650
WHEN YOU START GETTING
THAT PERSONAL CONNECTION,

00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,640
IT COULD TAKE IT
TO A WHOLE NOTHER LEVEL.

00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,710
Herjavec:
I LOVE THE BUSINESS.

00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:40,640
I GET A SENSE THAT THIS IS MORE
THAN JUST A BUSINESS FOR YOU.

00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,630
THIS COMPANY IS SO MUCH MORE
THAN JUST A PRODUCT.

00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,570
WE'RE STANDING UP HERE
FOR EVERY MILITARY SPOUSE

00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,610
THAT'S EVER HAD A DREAM.

00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,650
AND SO HAVE A LOT RIDING
ON OUR SHOULDERS.

00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,640
SO, TODAY WE JUST WANTED TO COME
HERE AND TELL OUR STORY

00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,640
AND -- AND TELL YOU
THAT MILITARY SPOUSES --

00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,600
ALTHOUGH THEY'RE
WEARING THE UNIFORM,

00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,680
THEY'RE SERVING
IN THEIR OWN WAY.

00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,610
THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE AT
HOME, MAKING SURE THAT THEY --

00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,640
THAT THE SOLDIERS HAVE A FAMILY
TO COME HOME TO.

00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,530
YOU KNOW, IT'S EXTREME COURAGE
AND SACRIFICE

00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,600
TO BE A MILITARY WIFE.

00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,680
SOMETIMES IT IS.

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,690
WHY DO YOU FEEL
YOU NEED A PARTNER?

00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,640
I THINK THAT YOU GUYS
ARE REALLY ONTO SOMETHING.

00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,610
MANUFACTURING, MAKING AND
RETAILING IN THE UNITED STATES,

00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,600
IS -- IT'S GONNA BE
A HARD BUSINESS.

00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,580
I THINK WE NEED
A STRATEGIC PARTNER

00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,620
AND SOMEBODY WHO CAN HELP US
GET TO THAT LEVEL

00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,630
WHERE WE CAN INCREASE
THE DEMAND STEADILY.

00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,610
IF I GAVE YOU THE MONEY,
TELL ME HOW YOU WOULD SPEND IT.

00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,730
WE COULD START IMMEDIATELY
WITH BASIC ONLINE STRATEGIES,

00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:33,091
LIKE PAY-PER-CLICK ADVERTISING,
CONTENT MARKETING,

00:08:33,091 --> 00:08:34,660
JUST BASICS.

00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,590
SCALING THE COMPANY SMARTLY
IS PARAMOUNT.

00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,690
WE PLANNED OUT FOR,
IF WE SOLD $1 MILLION,

00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:42,600
THAT WE COULD FULFILL THAT
WITH 30 OPERATORS

00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,570
IN THE NEW SPACE
THAT WE HAVE.

00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,640
IT WOULD TAKE US THREE MONTHS
OF PRODUCTION.

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,610
OKAY. SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE --
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A LEAD TIME --

00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:49,630
THAT'S A PROBLEM.

00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,680
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO SAY THAT

00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,600
IT'S A 90-DAY LEAD TIME TO GET
YOUR PRODUCT TO DELIVER.

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,660
BUT I DON'T THINK IN THIS CASE
THAT'S A PROBLEM, MARK.

00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,590
THE 90 DAYS WOULD BE BECAUSE
WE NEED TO HIRE PEOPLE.

00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,610
IT'S JUST HIRING THE PEOPLE,
TRAINING THEM UP,

00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,610
AND STARTING PRODUCTION.

00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,560
WHEN YOU -- WHEN YOU END UP
MAKING MONEY,

00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,670
YOU BELIEVE THAT MAYBE
SOMEBODY ELSE

00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,610
CAN DO SOMETHING BETTER
THAN YOU CAN.

00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,700
AND YOU GO IN,

00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,710
OFFER SOMEBODY 1/3 POTENTIALLY
OF YOUR COMPANY.

00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:15,600
THEN YOU FIND OUT THAT THEY ARE
NO BETTER THAN YOU

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,590
AND THEY DON'T KNOW YOUR
BUSINESS AS WELL AS YOU DO.

00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,610
AND NOW YOU'VE GIVEN
THAT PERCENTAGE

00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,640
TO SOMEBODY ELSE
THAT DIDN'T EARN IT.

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,640
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE I WOULD ADD VALUE.

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,560
PURELY JUST MONEY --
YOU JUST DON'T NEED THAT.

00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,610
YOU'RE MAKING IT.

00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,630
SO I THINK THAT YOU CAN DO THIS
WITHOUT ME.

00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,570
AT THIS STAGE,
FOR AN INVESTMENT,

00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,720
IT'S NOT IN YOUR BEST INTEREST,
SO I'M OUT.

00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,660
Narrator:
ONE SHARK IS OUT.

00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,710
LISA AND CAMERON
HAVE FOUR MORE CHANCES

00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:53,650
FOR A DEAL FOR THEIR COMPANY,
R. RIVETER --

00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:56,530
A BAG LINE MADE BY
MILITARY SPOUSES.

00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:57,710
I LIKE IT.

00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,630
IT FITS KIND OF WHAT I'M DOING
IN TWO OTHER BUSINESSES.

00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,650
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $100,000.

00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,550
YOU WANTED 10 --
YOU WANT TO SELL 10%?

00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,620
-20%.
-20%.

00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,470
O'Leary: UM, OKAY.

00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,660
BUT I-I DON'T WANT --
HE JUST WANTS TO GIVE YOU
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR.

00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,540
I DON'T WANT TO PART-- I DON'T
WANT TO PARTNER WITH ANYBODY.

00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,560
THAT'S IT.
I KNOW IT HAS TO BE DONE.

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,610
OUT OF RESPECT
FOR THE OTHER SHARKS,

00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,510
CAN WE HEAR
WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY?

00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,620
I-I LOVE THE STORY.

00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,530
MORE SO, I LOVE THE PRODUCT
AND I LOVE THE BUSINESS.

00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,640
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER --

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,690
$100,000 FOR 20%,
SAME OFFER THAT KEVIN MADE.

00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,750
Cuban: I'M HAPPY TO MAKE
AN OFFER, AS WELL.

00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,730
I'LL GIVE YOU YOUR $100,000
FOR 20%, RIGHT?

00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:37,610
BUT WHAT I'LL ALSO DO IS PROVIDE
WHATEVER CREDIT YOU NEED

00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,580
FOR THE INVENTORY.

00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,730
AND IF WE NEED
EXTRA EQUIPMENT,

00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:44,550
I HAVE NO PROBLEM PROVIDING
THE CREDIT FOR THAT.

00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,580
THAT'S MY OFFER.

00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,610
UM, WELL...

00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:47,660
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR OFFERS.

00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,610
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
IF I COULD DO WHAT YOU DO.

00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,660
MY MOTTO --
WHAT I'VE ALWAYS DONE IS

00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,650
I MAKE THINGS FOR MASS,
RIGHT?

00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,610
YOU'RE DOING A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT MODEL

00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:00,600
THAN WHAT I'M USED TO.

00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,510
I ADMIRE AND RESPECT IT,

00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,540
AND I THINK IT'S GREAT.

00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,680
I WISH YOU LUCK,
BUT I'M OUT.

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,640
John: LORI AND I ARE BOTH OUT
FOR THE SAME REASONS.

00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,660
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT YOU SHOULD
TELL ALL THREE OF THESE BOBOS

00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,600
TO TAKE A WALK AND KEEP THE REST
OF YOUR COMPANY,

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,610
AND YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,620
THANK YOU, DAYMOND.
THAT'S USEFUL.

00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,730
John: BUT NOW YOU HAVE
THREE OFFERS.

00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:24,620
OKAY.

00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,560
MARK, YOU HAVE A DEAL.

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,580
AH!
YES!

00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,650
-[ CHUCKLES ]
-GOOD.

00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,730
GOOD TO DO BUSINESS WITH YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,590
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,570
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU, LISA.
THANK YOU.

00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,610
-GOOD JOB, LADIES.
-THANK YOU GUYS.

00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,680
-CONGRATULATIONS.
-THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH.

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,630
Grenier: CONGRATULATIONS.
WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS GREAT.

00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,520
THANK YOU.
WE APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH.

00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,600
THEY DIDN'T NEED THE HELP.

00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,660
DAYMOND...
THEY DID.

00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,740
...IF THEY WALKED OUT BECAUSE
THE REST OF US SAID NO,

00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,540
YOU WOULD HAVE RUN DOWN,
GRABBED THEM, AND SAID,
"I'LL HELP YOU."

00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,500
SO?
I'M JUST SAYING.

00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,570
Grenier: [ LAUGHS ]

00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,560
Bradley: WE HAD SO MUCH
ON OUR SHOULDERS,

00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,670
REPRESENTING EVERY
MILITARY SPOUSE

00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,560
THAT'S WANTED SOMETHING MORE
THAN A PART-TIME JOB.

00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,690
WE HOPE THAT WE CAN GROW
THIS COMPANY

00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:59,600
AND HELP AS MANY MILITARY
SPOUSES AS POSSIBLE.

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,021
WE HOPE THAT WE INSPIRE
OTHER MILITARY SPOUSES

00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:02,680
TO DO WHAT THEY LOVE

00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,750
AND ASPIRE TO REACH THEIR GOALS,
DREAMS, AND PASSIONS.

00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,091
Narrator: IN SEASON SIX,

00:12:11,091 --> 00:12:13,630
WE WATCHED AIR FORCE VETERAN
KRISTINA GUERRERO

00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,720
MAKE A DEAL WITH DAYMOND JOHN

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,660
FOR HER TurboPUP,
A MEAL-ON-THE-GO BAR FOR DOGS.

00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,540
John: I'LL GO $100,000
FOR 40%.

00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,590
-35%?
-YOU GOT IT.

00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,650
Narrator: LET'S SEE
WHAT THEY'RE UP TO NOW.

00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,670
KRISTINA!
HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,690
DAYMOND,
SO GOOD TO SEE YOU!

00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,570
John: I'M IN PHOENIX TODAY
WITH KRISTINA FROM TurboPUP

00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,630
FOR A BIG MEETING
AT PetSmart HEADQUARTERS.

00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,540
YOU LOOK DIFFERENT.
WHEN ARE YOU DUE?

00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,550
NEXT MONTH.

00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,560
AH. WELL,
WE BETTER HURRY UP.

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,360
YOU WANT TO MEET
THE PetSmart GUYS?

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:37,700
YES!

00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,660
John: WHEN I FIRST SAW
KRISTINA PITCH,

00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,590
IT JUST HIT ME -- THERE IS NO
CATEGORY FOR CANINE MEAL BARS.

00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,610
I HAVE TWO DOGS THAT I LOVE,

00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,610
AND I SAW THERE WAS A NEED
FOR THE PRODUCT.

00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,510
-ERAN.
-DAYMOND.

00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,550
THANKS FOR HAVING US.

00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,590
Guerrero:
AFTER "SHARK TANK,"

00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,610
DAYMOND HELPED ME PARTNER UP

00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,690
WITH A COMPANY CALLED
FETCH FOR PETS!,

00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,640
A LEADING DISTRIBUTOR
IN THE PET INDUSTRY.

00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,680
THEY WERE INSTRUMENTAL

00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,630
IN SETTING UP THIS AMAZING DEAL
WITH PetSmart.

00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:59,670
THE IDEA OF A PORTABLE MEAL
SOLUTION -- AMAZING.

00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,660
WE ARE PREPARED
TO PUT TurboPUP

00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,500
IN MORE THAN 700 STORES
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,530
700?!
WOW.

00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,540
700.

00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,560
Guerrero: UP UNTIL NOW,

00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,560
WE'VE REALLY ONLY BEEN
AVAILABLE ONLINE,

00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,620
AND IT'S REALLY LIMITED
OUR SALES.

00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,700
BUT NOW TURBOPUPS EVERYWHERE
CAN TRY OUR BARS

00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,630
AND FALL IN LOVE WITH IT,
JUST LIKE MY OWN TURBOPUPS HAVE.

00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,680
-NICE.
-WOW.

00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,610
THIS IS WHERE EVERYTHING
IS MERCHANDISED

00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:19,650
BEFORE IT GOES
TO A REAL STORE.

00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,600
John: THIS IS A HUGE FIRST STEP
FOR TurboPUP,

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,610
AND WE HAVE SPEED TO MARKET.

00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:23,660
AND ONCE YOU HAVE
SPEED TO MARKET,

00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,590
GREAT DISTRIBUTION,
AND AN AMAZING PRODUCT,

AS SOON AS I TALKED TO HIM
ABOUT IT, HE WAS LIKE, "I'M IN,"

BECAUSE HE ACTUALLY
HAD THE PROBLEM

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,600
THAT THIS WOULD HAVE SOLVED
WHILE HE WAS OUT ON THE SLOPES.

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,680
SO, AFTER THAT,
WE GOT TOGETHER.

GET THE $500,000?

00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,650
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO
INTERFACE WITH DEVICES

00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:38,630
THAT DON'T REQUIRE MANIPULATION
BY YOUR DIGITS, OKAY?

00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:41,600
'CAUSE I'VE SEEN A HELMET NOW
THAT ALLOWS YOU TO SPEAK

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,570
TO A DEVICE
WHILE YOU'RE RIDING.

00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:44,630
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHETHER IT'S A CAR

00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,560
OR WHETHER YOU'RE ON A BIKE
OR A BICYCLE.

00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,550
-I'VE SEEN IT FOR...
-HOW ACCURATE IS IT?

00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,620
Herjavec:
VERY ACCURATE.

00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,710
WHAT'S YOUR GREATEST STRENGTH
AGAINST VOICE ACTIVATION?

00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:56,660
ONE, YOU C-- YOU DON'T MAKE ANY
MISTAKES USING THIS PRODUCT

00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,620
BECAUSE YOU KNOW PRECISELY WHERE
YOU'RE TOUCHING YOUR FINGER.

00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,680
WITH VOICE ACTIVATION...

00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,670
WELL, THAT'S A GOOD POINT.
THAT'S A FAIR POINT.

00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,690
...IT HAS HISTORICALLY HAPPENED
WHERE YOU TRY TO SAY SOMETHING

00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:07,570
AND IT EITHER MISREADS YOU AND
IT UNDERSTANDS SOMETHING ELSE

00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,710
AND THEN YOU GOT TO BACK OUT
OF THAT COMMAND SET

00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,640
TO TRY TO GET BACK IN
AND SAY WHAT YOU WOULD
YOU LIKE IT TO SAY.

00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,640
BUT THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT
IN INDUSTRIAL

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,670
THAN WHICH SONG YOU PICK.

00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,550
-IT'S A NICHE APPLICATION.
-SURE, ABSOLUTELY.

00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,570
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:18,620
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOUR OPTION
ISN'T A GOOD ONE.

00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,650
IT COULD BE AN ALTERNATIVE.

00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,650
IT MAY BE THAT THE MARKET'S
PASSED YOU BY.

00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,750
I'M NOT GONNA STICK AROUND
TO FIND OUT.

00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,570
I'M OUT.

00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:25,680
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,560
Cuban: THE AMOUNT OF TIME
YOU HAVE TO WAIT

00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,720
FOR THEM TO INTEGRATE
AND THEN SELL,

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,680
AND THEN YOU STILL HAVE
THAT ENTIRE RISK PROFILE

00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,520
OF NOT KNOWING
IF THEY'LL SELL --

00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,570
THE RISK/REWARD IS NOT THERE.

00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:40,540
I'M OUT.

00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,580
THANK YOU.

00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,500
I THINK THERE'S
SOME MERIT HERE,

00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,650
BUT HONESTLY, GUYS,

00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,710
YOU'RE ASKING FOR
A $10-MILLION VALUATION.

00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:51,540
IF YOU WOULD HAVE SAID MAYBE,
"I HAVE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS,"

00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,600
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.

00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,990
WE'RE NOT EVEN
IN THE SAME UNIVERSE.

00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:57,731
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA PUT AN OFFER
OUT AT THAT PRICE,

00:21:57,731 --> 00:21:58,640
SO I'M OUT.

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,640
THANK YOU, DAYMOND.

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,560
GUYS, TO ME, WHAT I WAS HOPING
YOU WOULD SAY

00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,700
WAS THAT THE GLOVE
WAS SIMPLY A --

00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:11,590
A CARRIER FOR THE TECHNOLOGY,
BUT IT'S ONE OF MANY.

00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,580
BUT EVERY TIME ANYBODY
ASKED YOU A QUESTION,

00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,560
WE ALWAYS WENT BACK
TO THE GLOVE.

00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,690
ROBERT,
IS THERE ANY VALUATION

00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:19,570
THAT YOU WOULD GIVE
THESE GUYS $500,000?

00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:20,660
WHAT PERCENTAGE
WOULD YOU NEED?

00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,620
WILLIE, THERE ARE --
THERE ARE SOME THINGS
THIS COMPANY'S WORTH.

00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,630
LOOK, HERE'S THE FIRST THING
I'LL TELL YOU --

00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:24,630
IS THERE A NUMBER?
GOOD FOR YOU.

00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,600
YOU'VE DEVELOPED
THE TECHNOLOGY.

00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,550
BUT WHEN YOU COME IN WITH
A $10 MILLION VALUATION,

00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,680
WE'RE GONNA TAKE IT
VERY SERIOUSLY.

00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,670
I DON'T WANT TO BE IN THE GLOVE
BUSINESS FOR $10 MILLION.

00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:35,560
-I-I --
-NEITHER DO WE.

00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,620
WELL, BUT YOU
HAVEN'T SHOWN ME

00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,761
HOW YOU'RE GONNA GET OUT
OF THE GLOVE BUSINESS.

00:22:37,761 --> 00:22:39,630
I'M OUT.

00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,710
THANK YOU, ROBERT.

00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:44,640
THE REASON WHY WE DON'T
WANT TO BE IN THE GLOVE
BUSINESS SO MUCH

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,710
IS BECAUSE WE HAVE LEARNED
FROM CONSUMERS,

00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:49,630
THEY ARE VERY PARTICULAR
ABOUT THE GLOVES THEY WEAR.

00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:50,710
SO WE CAN'T CARRY
A MILLION SKUs

00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:53,670
ON A MILLION DIFFERENT KINDS OF
GLOVES TO MAKE EVERYBODY HAPPY.

00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:56,560
I LIKE YOU GUYS.
I THINK YOU'RE SMART.

00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,620
I THINK IT IS A VERY CLEVER
APPLICATION.

00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:03,570
I LIKE ANYTHING
THAT KEEPS YOU SAFER.

00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:04,610
RIGHT.

00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:06,570
SO I THINK YOU REALLY HAVE
SOMETHING HERE

00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:08,610
THAT WILL BE APPEALING
TO THE CONSUMER

00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:10,670
AND MAYBE TO THE ARMY AND --
AND EVERYBODY ELSE,

00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:14,520
BUT YOU'RE JUST AT THIS POINT
OF FIGURING IT OUT.

00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,500
YOU'RE NOT REALLY SURE YET.

00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,520
MM-HMM.

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,520
I'M OUT.

00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,600
THANK YOU, LORI.

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,861
-THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE.
-ABSOLUTELY.

00:23:20,861 --> 00:23:21,660
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE.

00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,650
CONGRATS, GUYS.
GOOD LUCK.

00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,520
-ALL RIGHT, NOW.
-ALL RIGHT.

00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,560
IF THERE'S EVER A DEAL THAT
TELLS YOU VALUATION MATTERS,

00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,550
IT'S THIS ONE.

00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,630
NO, NOT AT ALL,
NOT AT ALL.

00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:32,680
ABSOLUTELY, MARK.
DOES IT? NO.

00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,640
WHY DIDN'T YOU STEP UP
AND WRITE A CHECK?

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,700
I'M TELLING YOU
THAT THEY'LL --

00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,700
THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF
STUFF YOU LOVE TO DO.

00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,670
IF -- IF THEY WOULD HAVE GIVEN
ME A PROOF OF CONCEPT --

00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,520
BECAUSE YOU THINK IT'S A PIECE
OF CRAP.

00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,700
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS A BUSINESS

00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,750
THAT BRINGS MILITARY PRECISION
TO YOUR HOME.

00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,580
HELLO, SHARKS.

00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,600
MY NAME IS ANGELA CODY ROUGET,

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,620
AND I WAS A MAJOR IN
THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE.

00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,620
I'M SEEKING $150,000

00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,700
FOR 20% EQUITY IN MY COMPANY,
MAJOR MOM.

00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:23,610
I AM ON A MISSION TO COMBAT
CLUTTER AND DISORGANIZATION

00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,610
IN HOMES ACROSS AMERICA.

00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:31,570
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS CRAVE
MORE ORDER IN THEIR HOMES,

00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,680
BUT MANY DON'T KNOW HOW
TO CREATE IT.

00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,610
MY TEAM OF HIGHLY TRAINED
LIBERATORS

00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:41,580
CAN PROFESSIONALLY ORGANIZE
EVERY ROOM IN YOUR HOME.

00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,610
HERE ARE SOME "BEFORE"
AND "AFTER" PICTURES

00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:46,530
OF SOME MISSIONS ACCOMPLISHED.

00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:48,398
I SAVED THIS MARRIAGE.

00:24:48,398 --> 00:24:48,756
[ CHUCKLES ]

00:24:48,756 --> 00:24:50,650
THE WIFE'S CAR GOT BACK
IN THE GARAGE.

00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,630
ALL THE HUSBAND'S STUFF
IS OUT OF THE WAY,

00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,630
AND THEY LOVE EACH OTHER AGAIN
AND THEIR HOME.

00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:57,608
THIS LITTLE GIRL CAN ACTUALLY
PLAY IN HER ROOM AGAIN.

00:24:57,608 --> 00:24:58,680
ISN'T THAT SWEET?

00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,680
AND NOW SHE'S ENJOYING HER HOME,
AND MAMA'S HAPPY.

00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:05,560
SHARKS, MAJOR MOM
IS THE ONLY COMPANY

00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,590
IN THE ORGANIZING-SERVICES
INDUSTRY

00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:11,640
THAT EMBODIES MILITARY VALUES
AND TACTICS.

00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,640
AS A MISSILE COMBAT
CREW COMMANDER,

00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,620
I GAINED VALUABLE
ORGANIZING SKILLS,

00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,630
SO MAJOR MOM IS HERE
TO SAVE THE DAY!

00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:22,690
BUT I NEED YOUR HELP TO SCALE
OUR OPERATIONS.

00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:27,600
IF THE PRESIDENT TRUSTED ME
WITH THE KEYS TO THE NUKES,

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,600
YOU CAN TRUST ME
WITH YOUR MONEY.

00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:35,540
WHICH SHARK WANTS TO PARTNER
WITH ME TO COMBAT CLUTTER?

00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,620
Grenier: I'M CURIOUS.

00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,590
YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE
A MISSILE CREW COMMANDER.

00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,620
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,620
THAT MEANT I HAD THE KEYS
TO MY NUKES.

00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,660
MY ACTUAL HAND IS ON THE KEYS

00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,600
THAT WOULD LAUNCH
INTERCONTINENTAL

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,700
BALLISTIC MISSILES
IN A FEW SECONDS.

00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,490
GOOD. WHILE YOU'RE LAUGHING
AND ON THE PHONE.

00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,510
THAT'S GOOD!

00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:50,868
[ LAUGHS ]

00:25:50,868 --> 00:25:52,560
Herjavec: THE ACTUAL
NUCLEAR MISSILES?

00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,590
THAT'S A -- A MISSILEER
CAN MULTITASK.

00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,570
I'M TRAINED TO DO
75 TASKS AT ONCE

00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:57,630
AND DO THEM ALL VERY WELL.

00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,610
SO, WHAT'S THE -- WHAT'S
THE CLOSEST YOU CAME?

00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:01,550
IF I TOLD YOU,
I'D HAVE TO KILL YOU.

00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,580
THAT'S OKAY.

00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,570
GO AHEAD! PLEASE!

00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:04,680
PLEASE TELL US!
THAT'S OKAY.

00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,560
SO, WHEN DID
YOU LEAVE SERVICE?

00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,590
HOW LONG AGO?
-I LEFT THE SERVICE 10 --

00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,720
AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE,
BY THE WAY.

00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,710
YOU'RE WELCOME.
I LEFT THE SERVICE 10 YEARS AGO.

00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,680
AND WHAT -- WHAT MADE YOU
COME UP WITH THIS IDEA?

00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,680
WELL, BASICALLY, WHEN I DECIDED
TO GET OUT OF THE MILITARY,

00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,670
I WAS GONNA BE
A STAY-AT-HOME MOM.

00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:21,670
AND UNFORTUNATELY, MY HUSBAND'S
REAL-ESTATE BUSINESS TANKED

00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:24,630
LITERALLY SIX MONTHS AFTER
I RESIGNED MY COMMISSION.

00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:27,590
SO HE SAID, "YOU'RE GONNA NEED
TO GO BACK TO WORK."

00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,590
DID YOU NUKE HIM?

00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,480
[ LAUGHS ]
I WANTED TO.

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,640
SO, ANYWAY...

00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,590
I SAID, "OKAY, WELL,
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?"

00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,640
AND HE SAID,
"YOU'RE SO ORGANIZED.

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,650
YOU LOVE TO DO IT.
YOU DO IT ALL THE TIME."

00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:38,700
TELL US ABOUT THE BUSINESS.

00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,680
WE ARE BASICALLY IN TWO STATES.
WE HAVE 16 EMPLOYEES.

00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,600
SO, IN COLORADO AND PHOENIX,
ARIZONA,

00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,670
WE HAVE BUILT THIS MODEL
OVER A SIX-YEAR PERIOD OF TIME.

00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:50,560
WE TRAIN THEM HOW WE WANT THEM
TO ORGANIZE

00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,600
WITH THE MAJOR MOM METHOD
OF ORGANIZING.

00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,540
LORI KNOWS THAT, WITH
OUR ORGANIZING PRODUCTS,

00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,670
IS YOU CAN'T
JUST BUY A PRODUCT.

00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,670
THERE'S AN APPROACH
TO ORGANIZING.

00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:00,620
HOW DOES IT WORK, ANGELA?
I CALL YOU UP.

00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,650
OKAY. SO, WHEN YOU CALL US,

00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:04,710
WE DO A FREE ESTIMATE
ON THE PHONE.

00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:07,720
RANGE GOES FROM $288
FOR A JUMP START PACKAGE --

00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:12,540
THAT'S 4 HOURS OF JUST A "GET IN
THERE AND GET 'EM STARTED" --

00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,620
UP TO A LIBERTY PACKAGE,

00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:18,640
WHICH IS 46 HOURS OF HANDS-ON

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,680
SO, YOU DO

IT'S OUR NUMBER-ONE-SELLING

00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:22,600
-THAT ONE IS.
-YEAH.

00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,610
BUT DO YOU COME IN
AND, LIKE, REALLY, LIKE,

00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:24,650
JUST GO THROUGH
THE WHOLE HOUSE?

00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:25,710
WE HAVE A WHOLE TEAM.
WE HAVE SIX ORGANIZERS --

00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,650
WE CALL OURSELVES "LIBERATORS"
-- GOING AT ONCE.

00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:30,650
SO, THIS YEAR,
WHAT WILL YOUR SALES BE?

00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:33,600
THIS YEAR, WE'RE ON TRACK
FOR $550,000 IN SALES.

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,630
THAT'S GREAT.
NO WAY.

00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:36,540
LAST YEAR,
WE CLOSED AT $407,000.
WOW.

00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,550
OKAY, NOW,
LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT.

00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,640
YOU HAVE TWO LOCATIONS.
YES.

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,700
AND YOU OWN BOTH
OF THOSE LOCATIONS.

00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,550
YES, MY BUSINESS PARTNER AND I
OWN THEM BOTH.
OKAY.

00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,650
HOW MUCH DO YOU MAKE
ON $550,000?

00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:45,610
PERSONALLY,
MY BUSINESS PARTNER AND I

00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,700
HAVE PAID OURSELVES BETWEEN
$20,000 AND $40,000 EVERY YEAR

00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,710
FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS
TO RUN THE BUSINESS.

00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,620
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY,
AFTER PAYING ALL SALARIES,

00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,670
PAYING ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES,

00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:56,640
LAST YEAR WE PUT $25,000
TO THE BOTTOM LINE

00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,560
BECAUSE WE RE-INVESTED A BUNCH
OF OUR PROFITS

00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,630
TO GET READY TO FRANCHISE.

00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,740
ASSUME YOU DIDN'T DO THAT.

00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,660
WHAT WOULD THE PROFIT HAVE BEEN
AFTER PAYING YOURSELF?

00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:08,570
PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN
$320,000.

00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:09,620
WE SPENT A LOT ON LEGAL,

00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,610
GETTING THE FRANCHISE
AGREEMENTS,

00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:12,640
THE NEW ENTITY SET UP.

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,590
WHAT'S IT COST TO OPEN UP
A FRANCHISE?

00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,680
$20,000 IS OUR INITIAL FEE,

00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:20,620
AND VETERANS WILL GET
50% VALUE PRICE ON THAT.

00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,580
AND WHAT ABOUT A ROYALTY
OR LIKE --

00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,710
8% ROYALTY.
OKAY.

00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,680
SO, BASICALLY,
WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP IT LOW

00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,620
BECAUSE MY TARGET MARKET
IS VETERANS.

00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,700
I'M VERY AWARE
THAT MY TARGET MARKET

00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,690
MAY NOT COME WITH A LOT OF CASH
TO THE TABLE.

00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:33,630
AND SO I PUT UP EITHER $10,000
OR $20,000, RIGHT?
MM-HMM.

00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,680
THAT'S TO YOU, RIGHT?
YES.

00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,620
WHAT IS MY CAP--
TO THE FRANCHISE.

00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,690
SO, I WANT TO OPEN ONE UP
IN DALLAS.

00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:40,660
WHAT OTHER OUT-OF-POCKET
EXPENSES AM I GONNA HAVE?

00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:43,710
WE REQUIRE $5,000 IN MARKETING
TO OPEN UP THE CITY.

00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:46,610
I GIVE YOU $25,000 TO GET
IN YOUR PROGRAM --

00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:48,620
$20,000 PLUS THE $5,000
FOR MARKETING.

00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,660
HOW MUCH MONEY WILL I MAKE
THE FIRST YEAR?

00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:53,590
THE FIRST YEAR,
YOU'LL MAKE $30,000.

00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,550
I GIVE YOU $25,000,

00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,600
I MAKE $30,000,
IF EVERYTHING GOES WELL.

00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,570
I HAVEN'T --
HOW -- HOW DO I LIVE?

00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,570
WITH ME TRAINING THEM,
WITH OUR SYSTEMS,

00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:02,600
WITH ALL OF OUR MARKETING,

00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,540
WITH EVERYTHING WE HAVE
IN PLACE,

00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,630
THEY SHOULD BE ABLE
TO MAKE MORE.

00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,630
HOWEVER, I'M GONNA STAY
CONSERVATIVE

00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,700
AND SAY YOU'RE PROBABLY
ONLY GONNA MAKE $30,000

00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,680
SO THAT THEY DON'T PUT THEIR
FAMILY IN A BAD SITUATION.

00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:17,550
IS THE $150,000 FOR 20%
OF THE OVERALL COMPANY

00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,620
OR JUST YOUR
FRANCHISEE COMPANY?

00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,600
YOU WOULD GET 20%
OF BOTH COMPANIES.

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,540
DO I GET 20%
OF THE DISTRIBUTIONS

00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,620
LIKE YOU
AND YOUR PARTNER GET?

00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,670
ABSOLUTELY.

00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:27,630
MY MAIN
EXIT STRATEGY --

00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,550
FOR YOU TO
GET YOUR MONEY BACK,

00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,720
I ONLY HAVE TO DO TWO THINGS
REALLY WELL.

00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,720
I NEED TO SELL 150 FRANCHISES
AT $20,000 A POP,

00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,600
AND I NEED TO MAKE SURE 90%
OF THOSE FRANCHISES

00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,690
ARE WILDLY SUCCESSFUL.

00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:40,590
SO, THE R-- THE ROYALTIES COME
ON THE BACK END.

00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,620
YOU REALIZE HOW DIFFICULT
THAT IS, RIGHT?

00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,650
-THAT'S VERY HARD.
-THAT IS REALLY HARD.

00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,630
-THAT WAS A --
-IT'S DIFFICULT FOR CIVILIANS.

00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:45,690
I LOVE THAT YOU KNOW
YOUR NUMBERS, THOUGH.
[ LAUGHS ]

00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:48,650
IF WE DECIDE TO SELL,
THEN WE SELL AND CASH OUT,

00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:51,590
OR WE LIVE OFF THE CASH COW
THAT I AM CREATING.

00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,630
[ CHUCKLES ]
I LOVE YOUR -- YOUR CERTAINTY.

00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:54,670
WHAT IF YOU DIDN'T
FRANCHISE?

00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:55,730
WHAT IF YOU JUST TOOK
YOUR BUSINESS

00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:58,570
AND CONTINUED TO GO THE WAY
THAT YOU WERE GOING?

00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:00,530
IT'S JUST NOT FUN.

00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,570
Herjavec: I THINK
IT'S GONNA BE A PROBLEM

00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:06,620
TO GET PEOPLE TO GIVE YOU
A CHECK FOR 25 GRAND.

00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:09,630
WHY NOT SIMPLY BRING THEM
INTO THE PROGRAM?

00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,640
LORI WANTS TO BE
A FRANCHISEE.

00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,550
INSTEAD OF HER GIVING YOU
A CHECK DAY ONE FOR $25,000,

00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,560
YOU GET HER GOING.

00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,670
SHE OWES YOU THE $25,000,

00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:21,640
BUT SHE SIMPLY PAYS IT
AT PORTION OF THE ROYALTY.
YOU JUST CREDIT -- YEAH.

00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,640
THE MORE PEOPLE THAT ARE
REPLICATING YOU,

00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,660
THE MORE MONEY
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE.

00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,600
BUT YOU'RE NOT THERE TODAY.

00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,630
I MEAN, I WISH YOU ALL
THE BEST, BUT...

00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,670
THANK YOU, ROBERT.

00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:30,488
...I-I CAN'T GET
THERE TODAY.

00:30:30,488 --> 00:30:31,610
-OKAY.
-I'M OUT.

00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:33,600
THANK YOU.

00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,690
I APPRECIATE IT.

00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:37,650
ANGELA, YOU ARE SO REMARKABLE
AT DOING THIS JOB --

00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:40,590
HIRING THE RIGHT PEOPLE,
ORGANIZING THEM,

00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,530
ACQUIRING CUSTOMERS.

00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:43,580
YOU'RE -- YOU'RE A TORNADO.

00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,610
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIND
OTHER PEOPLE LIKE YOU

00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,560
TO BE SUCCESSFUL
IN OTHER MARKETS,

00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,720
AND I THINK THAT'S GONNA BE
VERY HARD TO DO.

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,690
FRANCHISORS WANT A DREAM THAT
THEY'RE GONNA OPEN A SUB SHOP

00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:54,580
FOR $100,000 AND MAKE $1 MILLION
THE FIRST YEAR.

00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,630
THEY DON'T ALWAYS MAKE IT,

00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,640
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE THAT
OPPORTUNITY IN THIS BUSINESS.

00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,590
THAT'S THE PROBLEM I'M HAVING
WITH IT.

00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,560
BUT I DON'T THINK THE FRANCHISE
DEAL'S GONNA WORK.

00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,560
I'M SORRY. I'M OUT.

00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,640
OKAY.
THANK YOU, MR. WONDERFUL.

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,700
I THINK THAT I HAVE SOME OF
THOSE SAME CHALLENGES,

00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:12,590
THAT IT COSTS A LOT TO GET
INTO THE BUSINESS

00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:14,550
AND THERE'S NO GUARANTEES.
YEAH.

00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,710
SO I AM ABSOLUTELY A CUSTOMER,

00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:18,620
BUT I'M -- I CAN'T BE PART
OF THE BUSINESS. I'M OUT.

00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,600
OKAY. THANK YOU, DAYMOND.
THANK YOU.

00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,650
Cuban: ANGELA,
WHEN SOMEONE ASKS YOU,

00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:23,540
"WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GROW IT YOURSELF?"

00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,670
YOU SAY THAT'S NOT VERY FUN.

00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:27,610
WELL, IT'S MORE FUN TO HAVE A
BIG TEAM AND DO BIG THINGS...

00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:28,660
WELL, EXACTLY.
...'CAUSE IN THE MILITARY,

00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,760
WE HAVE BIG OPERATIONS
AND BIG TEAMS, AND IT'S --

00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,560
EXACTLY. THAT'S THE SCARIEST
ANSWER YOU CAN --
IT'S MORE EXCITING.

00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,560
THAT'S THE SCARIEST ANSWER
YOU CAN GIVE ME.

00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,660
IT REALLY IS --
BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS

00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,580
GONNA BE SOMETHING
MORE EXCITING.

00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,580
THERE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE
SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT

00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,630
THAN JUST GRINDING IT OUT.

00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:43,610
AND YOU THINK MANAGING
FRANCHISEES IS GONNA BE EASIER.

00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,670
-[ CHUCKLES ]
-IT'S NOT.

00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,630
I KNOW IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY.
IT'S GONNA BE WORSE

00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,610
'CAUSE THEY HAD THEIR
LIFE SAVINGS ON THE LINE.
RIGHT.

00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:51,550
I THINK WHAT YOU'VE DONE
IS NOBLE, RIGHT?
THANK YOU.

00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:52,660
TRYING TO HELP VETS --
THAT'S GREAT.

00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,580
BUT I THINK YOU'RE
UNDERESTIMATING

00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,650
THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT'S
GOING TO BE INVOLVED

00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:00,590
RUNNING A FRANCHISE ORGANIZATION
AND GROWING IT.

00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,610
OKAY.

00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:02,630
AND SO I'M OUT.

00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,550
OKAY. THANK YOU, MARK.
APPRECIATE THAT.

00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,620
YOU'RE WELCOME.

00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,610
LISTEN, ANGELA,
YOU DO WOMEN PROUD.

00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:09,590
YOU'VE DONE AMAZING THINGS.

00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,650
WHEN I STARTED MY BUSINESS,

00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:12,650
I STARTED WITH ONE
EARRING ORGANIZER.

00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:13,720
YES, I KNOW --
FOR YOUR MOM.

00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,590
AND I'VE -- I HAVE MADE A CAREER
ON ORGANIZERS.

00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:19,620
BUT I DON'T AGREE
WITH THE FRANCHISING.

00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,680
I THINK YOU COULD GROW THIS
INTO SOMETHING VERY LUCRATIVE

00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,690
FOR YOU
IF YOU KEEP IT SMALLER.

00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:26,670
BE THE ONLY ONE
IN YOUR REGION,

00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:28,710
AND YOU COULD BRING IN
A LOT OF MONEY.

00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:31,650
BUT ONCE YOU START GOING
INTO THAT FRANCHISING MODEL,

00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,660
YOU'RE GONNA SPREAD YOURSELF
SO THIN.

00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,620
YOU'RE GONNA BE RELYING
ON A LOT OF PEOPLE,

00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,580
AND I THINK IT'S GONNA BE
A LOT OF HEADACHES.

00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,600
OKAY.

00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,670
SO, THE REASON I'M OUT

00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,740
IS BECAUSE I HAVE A DIFFERENCE
OF OPINION

00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:45,630
AS TO WHERE I THINK YOU SHOULD
BE GOING WITH THE COMPANY.

00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,560
GOOD POINT.
THANK YOU, LORI.

MY TIME IN THE TANK IS NOT
GONNA DERAIL MY EFFORTS

00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:06,540
THIS MISSION PROVIDES PEACEFUL,
SUSTAINABLE CHANGE

00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,600
IN AREAS THAT NEED HOPE.

00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,670
OUR FOOTWEAR IS MADE
IN BOGOTá, COLOMBIA.

00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:13,580
WE SUPPORT CRAFTSMEN,
NOT CARTELS.

00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,580
OUR BELTS, SARONGS, SCARVES,
AND CASHMERE

00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:17,680
ARE MADE IN AFGHANISTAN.

00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,610
WE EMPLOY WOMEN AND PUT
LITTLE GIRLS IN SCHOOL.

00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,690
WE PARTNER WITH
A DE-MINING ORGANIZATION IN LAO

00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:24,750
TO MAKE A LINE OF JEWELRY
OUT OF LAND MINES.

00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:28,560
SHARKS, RIGHT NOW, YOU'RE
PROBABLY THINKING WE'RE CRAZY.

00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,600
AND YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,660
[ LAUGHS ]

00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:33,550
BUT SOMEBODY PROBABLY SAID
THE SAME THING TO YOU ONCE,

00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,630
AND IT DIDN'T STOP YOU.

00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,670
WE KNOW THAT BUSINESSES ARE
MORE POWERFUL THAN BULLETS.

00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:40,570
SO, SHARKS, ENLIST IN
THE UNARMED FORCES TODAY.

00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:41,670
WE BROUGHT YOU SOME GEAR

00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:44,600
FROM COLOMBIA, AFGHANISTAN,
AND LAO.

00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,630
THESE ARE FOR YOU.
I LOVE FLIP-FLOPS.

00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,670
ROBERT, WE GOT YOU THE --
THE AK-47s.

00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,550
THESE ARE REALLY
COMFORTABLE.

00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,650
THESE ARE BEAUTIFULLY MADE.

00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:53,680
Cuban:
WHERE'D YOU GUYS SERVE AT?

00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,600
WE SERVED WITH
THE 2nd RANGER BATTALION,

00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,580
75th RANGER REGIMEN.

00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,610
WHERE?

00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:00,550
WE DID TWO TOURS
IN AFGHANISTAN TOGETHER.

00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,560
I DID ONE TOUR IN IRAQ.

00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,660
AND DID YOU START
THE BUSINESSES THEN?

00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,817
WE -- WE HAD ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT
STARTING A BUSINESS TOGETHER,

00:35:04,817 --> 00:35:05,700
RIGHT, AND -- AND JUST,

00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,660
THROUGH OUR EXPERIENCES
IN AFGHANISTAN,

00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,637
WE -- YOU KNOW, WE FOUND
THAT WE WANTED TO DO MORE

00:35:10,637 --> 00:35:12,997
FOR THE COUNTRY OTHER
THAN GO OVER THERE AND
BE SOLDIERS, RIGHT?

00:35:12,997 --> 00:35:13,680
WE WANTED TO
KIND OF GIVE BACK.

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,550
AND WE --
AND WE THANK YOU FOR THAT.

00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,680
SO -- SO, I'M GONNA SPECULATE

00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,500
THAT THESE ARE
YOUR BIGGEST SELLERS.

00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,580
THEY ARE.

00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,580
WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE THEM

00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,590
AND WHAT DO THEY COST LANDED,

00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,610
AND THEN WHAT DO YOU SELL
THEM FOR HERE?

00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:25,580
SO, OUR FULL-LEATHER MODELS --
THE AK --

00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,680
THOSE WILL COST US
$20 TO MAKE.

00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,720
AND RIGHT NOW THEY COST US
$4.90 TO LAND EACH.

00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,550
SO RIGHT AROUND $25 BECAUSE
WE'RE AIR-SHIPPING THEM IN.

00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:33,600
WHY ARE YOU AIR-SHIPPING?

00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,560
WELL, BECAUSE
WE JUST HAVEN'T

00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,690
BEEN ABLE TO KEEP UP
WITH DEMAND.

00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:38,620
WE WERE SELLING THEM AS FAST
AS WE HAD THEM.

00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,610
FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS,
WE'VE BEEN SOLD OUT OF PRODUCT.

00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:41,600
WHAT -- WHAT DO YOU
SELL THEM FOR?

00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,590
WHAT WILL YOU SELL THEM
FOR? YES.

00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,600
WE'RE SELLING THEM
FOR $70.

00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,590
WHERE WERE YOU
SELLING THEM THROUGH?

00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,680
LAST YEAR,
WE HAD 89% ONLINE,

00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,630
DIRECT THROUGH OUR WEBSITE,
AND 11% THROUGH WHOLESALERS.

00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,580
WHAT ARE YOUR TOTAL SALES,
GRIFF?

00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,560
LAST YEAR,
WE DID $134,000,

00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,670
AND WE JUST ECLIPSED
LAST YEAR'S NUMBERS.

00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,610
I THINK WE'RE GONNA HIT
$300,000.

00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:57,690
WILL YOU MAKE MONEY THIS YEAR?

00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:59,550
WE'RE ALREADY MAKING MONEY
THIS YEAR.

00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,570
HOW MUCH YOU MAKING?

00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:01,670
WE'RE GONNA BE AT 5% NET
THIS YEAR.

00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:04,650
WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH VARIOUS
DIFFERENT TERRITORIES,

00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:06,690
THERE ARE A LOT OF CHALLENGES,
YOU KNOW?

00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:08,720
I REMEMBER WE OPENED A FACTORY
IN AFRICA,

00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,600
AND WE HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL
THE WORKERS HAD -- HAD BIKES.

00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,600
IT TOOK ABOUT A YEAR
TO REALLY UNDERSTAND

00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,640
WHERE THE CHALLENGES WERE.

00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,520
SO I KNOW THAT THOSE ARE
GONNA BE COMPLICATED.

00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,630
NOW, WITH THAT BEING SAID,

00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:23,058
WILL YOU BE ABLE
TO SCALE THIS ACCORDINGLY

00:36:23,058 --> 00:36:25,319
AND TO PROVIDE FOR PEOPLE
WHEN THEY WANT IT?

00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:26,660
WE BELIEVE SO.

00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,600
WE DON'T KNOW
HOW TO SCALE,

00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,550
WE'LL BE VERY HONEST
ABOUT IT.

00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:31,590
BUT WE GOT GUYS WHO DO.

00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:34,610
HEY, I'M A HUGE, HUGE,
HUGE BELIEVER

00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:35,640
IN BUSINESS OVER BULLETS,

00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,590
AND IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE
ANY IMPACT

00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,610
ON THE REST OF THE WORLD,

00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:39,720
WE GOT TO EXPORT
THE AMERICAN DREAM.

00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,600
SO, YOU SAID YOU WERE MAKING
SOMETHING IN AFGHANISTAN.

00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,600
GIVE ME THE SCOOP.

00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,700
SO, WE FOUND A WOMAN-OWNED
FACTORY,

00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,720
AND WE SAID, "HEY,
CAN YOU MAKE SOME SARONGS?"

00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,650
AND THEIR FIRST QUESTION WAS,
YOU KNOW, "WHAT'S A SARONG?"

00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,488
YOU'RE TRYING TO TALK ABOUT
BEACHWEAR TO AFGHAN WOMEN,

00:36:51,488 --> 00:36:52,600
AND THEY DON'T KNOW.

00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,670
SO, WE HAD TO --

00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,610
I'M STILL SHOCKED THEY LET
AN AFGHANI WOMAN OPEN A --

00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:57,660
OPEN A BUSINESS
AND HAVE A FACTORY.

00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,610
HER NAME'S
HASSINA SHERJAN.

00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:01,670
AND SHE LEFT AFGHANISTAN
WITH HER FAMILY,

00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:03,650
AND SHE WAS EDUCATED
IN AMERICA.

00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:06,630
AND SHE HEARD THAT AFGHAN WOMEN
WERE BEING PERSECUTED.

00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:07,650
SO SHE FLEW BACK.

00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:09,640
IN THE MID '90s,
SHE FUNDED UNDERGROUND,

00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,600
CLANDESTINE SCHOOLS
FOR GIRLS...

00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,640
WOW.
...DURING THE YEARS
OF THE TALIBAN.

00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,620
NOW SHE'S MANAGING ALL
THE SECONDARY EDUCATION

00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,620
FOR AFGHAN WOMEN.

00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,610
SHE'S TAKEN THE MONEY
FROM THE FACTORY

00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,570
THAT SHE'S MAKING
AND EDUCATING?

00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,620
YEAH,
AND WE'RE MATCHING HER.

00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,580
THAT'S AMAZING.

00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,660
FIRST OF ALL,
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE.

00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:28,590
I'M CHALLENGED
WITH HOW YOU SCALE THIS

00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:29,690
WITH SO MANY PRODUCTS.

00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:31,670
LOVE YOUR BACKGROUND.
LOVE THE DISCIPLINE.

00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,670
NOBODY HAS DISCIPLINE
LIKE VETS.

00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:36,610
BUT IT'S TOO MANY PRODUCTS
FOR THE SIZE YOU ARE.

00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:39,600
YOU'VE GOT TO BE NARROW,
AND YOU'VE GOT TO BE VERY DEEP.

00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,550
OR IT'S A PERSONAL CAUSE,
WHICH IS FINE.

00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:44,610
BUT THE CHALLENGE IS, ROBERT,

00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:46,630
IF THEY GO NARROW AND DEEP
ON THIS PRODUCT,

00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,700
THEN THEY WILL BE ABANDONING
A LOT OF THE TERRITORIES

00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,590
THEY'RE HELPING THAT DOESN'T
MAKE THIS PRODUCT.

00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:53,620
BUT THE REALITY
OF THE SITUATION --

00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,600
YOU'RE ASKING FOR $150,000
FOR 10% OF THE COMPANY.

00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,750
YOU'RE GIVING A VALUE OF
$1.5 MILLION ON THE COMPANY.

00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:03,600
AND WE HAVE TO, AT THIS POINT,
ADDRESS THAT, TO SOME EXTENT.

00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,560
WE JUST SIGNED
A CANADIAN DISTRIBUTOR

00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,670
THAT'S SELLING
INTO 390 STORES.

00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:09,650
WE JUST OPENED IN NEGOTIATIONS
WITH THE MILITARY EXCHANGES.

00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:10,690
-WHICH PRODUCTS?
-YEAH, WHICH --

00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:12,550
THEY'RE GONNA BE BUYING
THE FOOTWEAR.

00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,670
Herjavec: JUST THE FOOTWEAR?

00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:14,720
JUST THE FOOTWEAR IS WHAT
WE'RE GONNA FOCUS ON.

00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,660
O'Leary: I THINK WHAT YOU GUYS
ARE DOING IS REALLY --

00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:19,610
IT'S GOOD AND IT'S NOBLE
AND IT'S THE RIGHT THING.

00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,670
BUT THE FUNDAMENTALS
OF THE BUSINESS HERE --

00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:24,590
THE DIVERSIFICATION YOU'VE PUT
INTO YOUR MODEL

00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,630
ADDS A LOT OF
OPERATIONAL LOGISTICS RISK.

00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,680
I MEAN,
SUPPLYING THESE PRODUCTS

00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,640
FROM DIFFERENT PLACES
IS HARD ENOUGH.

00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,590
I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED
TO SEE A --

00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,670
A MYOPIC FOCUS
ON THE FOOTWEAR,

00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:36,570
TO BUILD IT UP TO A $5-MILLION,
$10-MILLION BUSINESS

00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:37,640
AND, WITH THE PROFITS
FROM THAT,

00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,570
SUPPORT ALL THESE
OTHER INITIATIVES

00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:40,660
YOU WANT TO DO
BECAUSE, IN THE END,

00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:43,550
A BUSINESS HAS TO MAKE MONEY
TO SURVIVE

00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:44,640
AND KEEP ALL THE PEOPLE
EMPLOYED,

00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,630
WHICH IS WHAT YOU GUYS
WANT TO DO.

00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,640
I'M FINDING THE DEAL
TOO DIVERSIFIED

00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,640
AND NOT FOCUSED ENOUGH, IN TERMS
OF BEING AN INVESTMENT.

00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,750
SO, FOR ME, I'M OUT.

00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,600
I GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU,
KEVIN.

00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,490
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,560
WHAT IS THAT?

00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,580
IT'S HOW WE MARK THE DEAD.

WOW.
I LOVE IT.

00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:11,560
-I LOVE THAT.
-I LOVE IT.

00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,560
I SHOULD GIVE YOU AN OFFER
JUST FOR THAT.

00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,590
COOL.

00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:15,580
Herjavec: GRIFF,
YOU HAVE A GREAT STORY,

00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,630
YOU HAVE A GREAT BRAND,

00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:19,690
BUT IT'S TOO MANY PRODUCTS
FOR THIS SIZE.

00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,760
IT'S GONNA BE CHALLENGING
TO KEEP GROWING.

00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,750
I'M OUT.

00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,550
PLEASE DON'T GIVE ME
AN ORANGE THING.

00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:27,590
[ BOTH LAUGH ]

00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,580

Grenier:
I LIKE THE MISSION.

00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:32,620
I LOVE WHAT YOU'VE DONE
FOR SERVING OUR COUNTRY.

00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,580
VERY DIFFICULT TO DO
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:38,570
I KNOW THAT.
I THINK DAYMOND KNOWS THAT, TOO.

00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:39,650
I DO AGREE
WITH THE OTHER SHARKS

00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:43,630
ABOUT FOCUSING IN ON SOMETHING
THAT'S YOUR STRENGTH,

00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,680
LIKE THE FLIP-FLOPS,

00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:49,610
THEN BRANCHING OUT,
IS SMARTER, TO ME.

00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:51,560
IF ANOTHER SHARK
WILL GO IN WITH ME...

00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,520
I'D BE WILLING TO MAKE YOU
AN OFFER.

00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,640
WHAT WOULD YOU OFFER?

00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,560
I'D LIKE TO HEAR
IF SOMEONE ELSE

00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,640
IS INTERESTED IN GOING IN
WITH ME,

00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,640
IF MARK OR DAYMOND IS.

BE 200K FOR 25%.

YOU WANT ME TO SAY IT?

00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,660
YEAH.
OKAY.

00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,560
[ LAUGHS ]
YOU CAN -- YOU CAN SAY IT.

00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,680
LOOK,
WE'RE BOTH BIG BELIEVERS.

00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,690
I MEAN, BUSINESS OVER BULLETS
EVERY DAY.

00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:26,640
SO, WHILE FROM A PURELY
BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE,

00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,590
FOCUSING, YOU KNOW,
ON YOUR CORE PRODUCT

00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:32,670
WOULD MAKE PERFECT SENSE,
THERE'S A BIGGER PICTURE HERE.

00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:34,670
YOU'VE GOT TWO STORIES
GOING ON,

00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,640
ONE IN THE -- THE --
THE FOOTWEAR,

00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,610
ONE WITH THE SARONGS OR WHATEVER
THE HECK THESE ARE CALLED.

00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:41,620
WE -- WE WANT -- WHATEVER
YOU'RE MAKING IN AFGHANISTAN,

00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,530
WE WANT TO MAKE MORE
OF IT, RIGHT?

00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:44,560
WE WANT TO HIRE
MORE PEOPLE.

00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,590
WE WANT MORE PEOPLE
TO BE EDUCATED.

00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:49,580
SO HERE'S THE OFFER.
YOU ASKED FOR 150K FOR 10%.

00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:54,490
WHAT WE'D LIKE TO DO IS GIVE YOU

00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:58,570
SO, DAYMOND'S WILLING TO LET ME

THIS IS 12.5%,
12.5% OVER HERE.

00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,710
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
PUT UP ANY CASH,

00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,660
AND YOU GET TO PICK
ANY OF THE PRODUCTS

00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,600
THAT YOU FEEL WORK

00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,690

THAT'S A LOT OF --
THAT'S A LOT OF HORSEPOWER.

00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,540
THEY WOULD HAVE TO UP THE CASH
