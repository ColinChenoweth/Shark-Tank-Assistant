MANUAL CALORIE-COUNTING,

00:02:33,512 --> 00:02:36,362
WHICH IS TIME CONSUMING,

OUR MISSION IS TO GET SmartPlate

OF EVERY AMERICAN WHO WANTS
TO IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH.

00:03:15,452 --> 00:03:19,482
SO, SHARKS, WHO'S READY TO TAKE
A BITE OUT OF SmartPlate?

00:03:19,482 --> 00:03:20,582
DO YOU HAVE PLATES
THAT WE CAN LOOK AT?

00:03:20,582 --> 00:03:21,652
YES, YES, I DO.
I'M GONNA HAVE TO SEE IT.

00:03:21,652 --> 00:03:23,432
I'M GONNA HAND THOSE OUT
RIGHT NOW.

00:03:23,432 --> 00:03:25,482
SO, WE HAVE A PROTOTYPE
OF OUR MERCHANDISING,

00:03:25,482 --> 00:03:28,523
AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE
A PROTOTYPE

00:03:28,523 --> 00:03:29,643
OF THE SmartPlate.
A PROTOTYPE.

00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:30,512
PRO-- UH-OH.
OH.

00:03:30,512 --> 00:03:31,632
LET'S GET INTO
THE TECHNOLOGY.

00:03:31,632 --> 00:03:33,542
YES. SO, THE WAY THAT IT WORKS
IS IT TAKES A PICTURE,

00:03:33,542 --> 00:03:35,392
AND THEN IT ANALYZES
THE PICTURE,

00:03:35,392 --> 00:03:36,642
AND IT'S ABLE
TO IDENTIFY THE FOOD.

00:03:36,642 --> 00:03:38,552
COMBINES THAT
WITH THE WEIGHT INFORMATION.

00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,482
ONCE WE HAVE BOTH OF THOSE,

00:03:40,482 --> 00:03:42,612
THEN WE ARE ABLE TO TELL YOU
THE MICRO- AND MACRONUTRIENTS.

00:03:42,612 --> 00:03:44,602
HOW DOES IT DIFFERENTIATE

00:03:44,602 --> 00:03:47,362
FRIED RICE
WITH A CERTAIN TYPE OF OIL

00:03:47,362 --> 00:03:48,652
AND ANOTHER TYPE OF OIL,
YOU KNOW?

00:03:48,652 --> 00:03:51,362
SO, OILS AND THINGS
OF THAT NATURE,

00:03:51,362 --> 00:03:52,612
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO PICK UP,

00:03:52,612 --> 00:03:54,412
BUT WE DO HAVE A SOLUTION
FOR THAT.

00:03:54,412 --> 00:03:55,652
SO, WE GIVE CONSUMERS
THREE OPTIONS.

00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,432
THEY CAN EITHER "SNAP IT,"
"SCAN IT," OR "SAY IT."

00:03:58,432 --> 00:04:02,382
SO, WE HAVE OVER 350,000
CPG BARCODES.

00:04:02,382 --> 00:04:03,562
IF SOMEBODY'S OUT
AT A RESTAURANT,

00:04:03,562 --> 00:04:06,392
WE HAVE A DATABASE
OF RESTAURANT MEALS, AS WELL.

00:04:06,392 --> 00:04:08,442

GOD MADE STREET MEAT.

00:04:12,462 --> 00:04:13,612
THERE'S NO BARCODE

00:04:15,412 --> 00:04:17,432
HOW -- HOW IS THAT
GONNA HELP ME?

00:04:17,432 --> 00:04:18,592
IF YOU TAKE A PICTURE
OF THE HOT DOG,

00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,592
WE'LL BE ABLE TO ANALYZE AND
IDENTIFY THAT IT'S A HOT DOG.

00:04:20,592 --> 00:04:23,602
THEN, IF IT WAS -- IT WAS ON,
YOU KNOW, THE SmartPlate,

00:04:23,602 --> 00:04:25,482
WE'D BE ABLE
TO IDENTIFY THE WEIGHT.

00:04:25,482 --> 00:04:27,502
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE
THE SmartPlate,

00:04:27,502 --> 00:04:30,372
JUST WITH YOUR SMARTPHONE
AND THE "SNAP IT" FEATURE,

00:04:30,372 --> 00:04:31,372
YOU'D BE ABLE
TO TAKE A PICTURE.

00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:32,522
WE'D SAY
THAT IT'S A HOT DOG.

00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,632

HOW THAT APP ACTUALLY WORKS

00:04:34,632 --> 00:04:36,422
SO WE GET
A BETTER FEEL FOR IT?

00:04:36,422 --> 00:04:37,412
I'D LOVE TO DO THAT.

00:04:37,412 --> 00:04:38,542
WHAT'S FIRING RIGHT NOW

00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:40,472
IS THE FOOD-RECOGNITION
PORTION.

00:04:40,472 --> 00:04:41,582
WE DON'T HAVE
THE WEIGHT SENSORS

00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:43,492
IN THESE
AESTHETIC PROTOTYPES YET,

00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:46,602
BUT I CAN DEMONSTRATE THE
FUNCTIONALITY, IF THAT'S OKAY.

00:04:46,602 --> 00:04:48,502
WE'RE GONNA HIT "SNAP IT."

00:04:48,502 --> 00:04:50,632
THEN WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT
OUR PIECE OF PIZZA HERE.

00:04:50,632 --> 00:04:52,552
WE'RE GONNA TAKE A PICTURE.

00:04:52,552 --> 00:04:54,382
[ CELLPHONE CAMERA CLICKS ]

00:04:54,382 --> 00:04:56,442
AND, THEN WITHIN SECONDS,
IT'LL BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY IT.

00:04:58,472 --> 00:04:59,472
AND THERE YOU SEE IT.

00:04:59,472 --> 00:05:01,382
I SEE
THREE CAMERAS THERE.

00:05:01,382 --> 00:05:02,472
YES.

00:05:02,472 --> 00:05:04,532
SO, TALK ABOUT THOSE.
ABSOLUTELY.

00:05:04,532 --> 00:05:07,362
YEAH, BECAUSE WHAT WERE YOU --
WHAT WERE USING YOUR PHONE FOR

00:05:07,362 --> 00:05:09,522
IF THE CAMERAS ARE ALL
IN THIS -- IN THE PLATE.

00:05:09,522 --> 00:05:11,432
I WAS -- SO, WHAT I WAS
USING MY PHONE FOR

00:05:11,432 --> 00:05:13,542
WAS TO SIMULATE THE CAMERAS.
WE DON'T HAVE --

00:05:13,542 --> 00:05:15,382
OH, YOU WERE SIMULATING
THESE CAMERAS IN HERE.

00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:16,392
THAT'S CORRECT.
OKAY, YEAH, I UNDERSTAND.

00:05:16,392 --> 00:05:17,402
BUT THOSE CAMERAS
CAN SEE THAT.

00:05:17,402 --> 00:05:18,482
I MEAN, THE ASPECT --

00:05:18,482 --> 00:05:20,442
IT'S ONE THING
TO GET AN OVERHEAD VIEW.

00:05:20,442 --> 00:05:22,452

00:05:23,602 --> 00:05:26,392
WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO IS
IT'S GONNA BE LIFTED.

00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:28,562
IT'S GONNA BE RAISED,
SO IT'S ABOVE THE FOOD, OKAY?

00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:30,602
THE CAMERA'S
ABOVE THE FOOD?

00:05:30,602 --> 00:05:32,622
IT'S GONNA BE ABLE TO GIVE US
A 180 VIEW.

00:05:32,622 --> 00:05:34,602
GETTING TO MARKET, OKAY,

00:05:34,602 --> 00:05:36,582
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF STUFF
THAT YOU HAVE TO MAKE WORK.

00:05:36,582 --> 00:05:38,572
PARTICULARLY
THE CAMERA TECHNOLOGY.

00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:39,622

I USE THESE APPS.

00:05:39,622 --> 00:05:40,612
IT WORKS.

00:05:40,612 --> 00:05:42,372
YOU'RE NOT USING THE APP
PROPERLY.

00:05:42,372 --> 00:05:43,552
THAT'S WHY I HAVE
AN ADONIS BODY.

00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:45,362

AT THE END OF THE DAY,

00:05:45,362 --> 00:05:47,632
I'M THINKING IF YOU SOLD

00:05:47,632 --> 00:05:50,472

GONNA COST AT RETAIL?

00:06:13,652 --> 00:06:16,512

YOU'RE TRYING TO CONVEY
THE MESSAGE

00:06:44,422 --> 00:06:45,412
THAT OTHER PEOPLE
ARE INTERESTED.

00:06:45,412 --> 00:06:46,472
I'M NOT ASKING THAT,
I JUST WANT --

00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:47,562
THAT'S CORRECT, MARK. YES.

I'M UNCOMFORTABLE

00:06:50,382 --> 00:06:51,632
WITH THE WAY THAT
YOU'RE MAKING THIS PITCH.

00:06:51,632 --> 00:06:53,472
WELL, TOO BAD, THEN.
YOU IN, YOU OUT?

00:06:53,472 --> 00:06:54,452
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
DAYMOND?
IT'S A LITTLE...

00:06:54,452 --> 00:06:55,622
AND SO, I'M OUT.

00:06:57,442 --> 00:06:59,492
MARTIN, WHEN I LOOK AT
HOW PEOPLE EAT,

00:06:59,492 --> 00:07:01,382
INCLUDING MYSELF
AND MY FAMILY,

00:07:01,382 --> 00:07:03,602
I THINK THAT PEOPLE DON'T
EAT ALL THEIR FOOD

00:07:03,602 --> 00:07:05,562
AT HOME
NEAR THE SmartPlate.

00:07:05,562 --> 00:07:08,582
THEY HAVE LUNCH AT SCHOOL.
THEY HAVE LUNCH ON THE RUN.

00:07:08,582 --> 00:07:10,372
THEY EAT AT A RESTAURANT
AT NIGHT.

00:07:10,372 --> 00:07:11,652
YOU'RE GONNA SPEND
A LOT TIME AND MONEY

00:07:11,652 --> 00:07:14,372
TRYING TO SELL
THESE PLATES TO PEOPLE,

00:07:14,372 --> 00:07:16,362
AND I DON'T REALLY THINK
THEY HAVE ANY MERIT AT ALL.

00:07:16,362 --> 00:07:17,263
I'M OUT.

00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:22,412
HERE'S WHERE
I'M KIND OF GOING IN CIRCLES.

00:07:22,412 --> 00:07:24,622
I DON'T SEE ANY TECHNOLOGY
THAT YOU GUYS INTRODUCED.

00:07:24,622 --> 00:07:27,382
THIS IS
A TECHNOLOGICAL PRODUCT.

00:07:27,382 --> 00:07:28,382
Dell'Arciprete:
MM-HMM. THAT'S CORRECT.

00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:29,492
YOU'VE SOLD IT AS SUCH,
RIGHT?

00:07:29,492 --> 00:07:30,472
YES.
IT IS.

00:07:30,472 --> 00:07:31,602
YOU'RE TRYING
TO SELL THE VALUE,

00:07:31,602 --> 00:07:36,392
AND WHAT I'M HEARING
IS THE VALUE PROPOSITION,

00:07:36,392 --> 00:07:37,532
THE CORE COMPETENCY,

00:07:37,532 --> 00:07:40,642
YOU'RE HIRING FROM
THIRD-PARTY DESIGN COMPANIES,

00:07:40,642 --> 00:07:42,412
AND YOU'RE HOPING
THEY CAN MAKE IT WORK.

00:07:42,412 --> 00:07:45,402
THEY'RE EXPERIENCED
IN THE SPACE.

00:07:45,402 --> 00:07:46,432
WHAT IF IT DOESN'T WORK?

00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,482
YOU'RE BETTING
YOUR ENTIRE COMPANY

00:07:48,482 --> 00:07:50,512
ON SOME
EXTERNAL DESIGN COMPANY.

00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:52,482
YOU GUYS CAN'T CONTROL
YOUR OWN DESTINY.

00:07:52,482 --> 00:07:54,622
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHETHER
OR NOT THIS STUFF IS
EVEN GOING TO WORK.

00:07:54,622 --> 00:07:56,622
THAT IS A HUGE PROBLEM
FOR ME.

00:07:56,622 --> 00:07:58,402
I'M OUT.

00:07:59,632 --> 00:08:01,632
I GOT TO TELL YOU,
AS A TECHNOLOGIST,

00:08:01,632 --> 00:08:03,592
I THINK
THE PLATE IS A CRUTCH.

00:08:03,592 --> 00:08:05,452
I THINK
IT'S AN INTERIM STEP

00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:07,392
THAT WILL BE OBSOLETE
SOON ENOUGH.

00:08:07,392 --> 00:08:09,452
IF YOUR PHOTO-RECOGNITION
TECHNOLOGY

00:08:09,452 --> 00:08:11,602
WERE AS GOOD
AS IT SHOULD BE,

00:08:11,602 --> 00:08:13,462
THEN IT CAN INFER
VOLUME AND MASS

00:08:13,462 --> 00:08:14,602
FROM THE PICTURE
IT TAKES.

00:08:14,602 --> 00:08:16,462
I DON'T NEED TO WEIGH
THE PIZZA.

00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:18,452
I DON'T NEED TO TAKE AN
ANCILLARY PHOTO FROM THE SIDE.

00:08:18,452 --> 00:08:19,522
SO, YOU'RE TRYING
TO SELL PEOPLE

00:08:19,522 --> 00:08:22,452
A VERY EXPENSIVE,
VERY FRAGILE, HARD THING

00:08:22,452 --> 00:08:23,522
THAT DOESN'T FIT
IN THEIR POCKET,

00:08:23,522 --> 00:08:25,362
THAT CAN'T GO
WITH THEM ANYWHERE,

00:08:25,362 --> 00:08:26,582
AND YOU'RE CHARGING
A LOT OF MONEY FOR IT.

00:08:26,582 --> 00:08:28,422
THERE'S SO MANY
DIFFERENT WAYS

00:08:28,422 --> 00:08:29,472
THIS BUSINESS FAILS
RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE,

00:08:29,472 --> 00:08:30,412
AND FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.

00:08:32,642 --> 00:08:34,492
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING,
BARBARA?

00:08:34,492 --> 00:08:36,552
CAN I JUST MAKE ONE -- CAN I
MAKE A QUICK POINT, BARBARA?

00:08:36,552 --> 00:08:38,442
CERTAINLY, GO AHEAD.
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

00:08:38,442 --> 00:08:39,502
BARBARA, I KNOW THAT
YOU HAVE A LOT OF INVESTMENTS

00:08:39,502 --> 00:08:41,362
IN THE FOOD SPACE.
YES, I DO.

00:08:41,362 --> 00:08:43,382
A LOT OF YOUR PORTFOLIO
IS IN THIS SPACE.

00:08:43,382 --> 00:08:45,362
THERE'S CONSUMERS
THAT ARE OUT THERE,

00:08:45,362 --> 00:08:47,382
AND THEY'RE DOING ALL THIS
MANUALLY.
YES.

00:08:47,382 --> 00:08:50,422
WE AUTOMATE THAT --
WE AUTOMATE THAT PROCESS.

00:08:50,422 --> 00:08:51,632
I FEEL SO BADLY,
'CAUSE YOU'RE SO HEARTFELT.

00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:55,412
YET, YOUR PRESENTATION
REALLY WAS JUST TERRIBLE.

00:08:55,412 --> 00:08:56,532
I'M SORRY TO SAY.

00:08:56,532 --> 00:08:58,572
JUST TERRIBLE.
AND CONFUSING.

00:08:58,572 --> 00:08:59,582
I'M OUT.

00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:01,612
OKAY.

00:09:01,612 --> 00:09:02,602
Cuban:
GOOD LUCK, MARTIN.

00:09:02,602 --> 00:09:03,532
GOOD LUCK.
GOOD LUCK.

00:09:03,532 --> 00:09:04,612
THANKS A LOT, GUYS.

00:09:04,612 --> 00:09:06,402
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
I APPRECIATE IT.

00:09:08,602 --> 00:09:09,652
IT WAS TOUGH.

00:09:09,652 --> 00:09:11,432
YOU KNOW, THEY FIRED
A LOT OF QUESTIONS.

00:09:11,432 --> 00:09:13,432
YOU KNOW, I TRIED TO KEEP
MY PASSION POINTS THERE.

00:09:13,432 --> 00:09:15,412
I TRIED TO WALK THEM
THROUGH THE BUSINESS.

00:09:15,412 --> 00:09:17,442
YOU KNOW, BUT IT WAS --
IT WAS A TOUGH DAY.

00:09:17,442 --> 00:09:20,502
BUT, HONESTLY, YOU KNOW,
WE STILL BELIEVE IN SmartPlate

00:09:20,502 --> 00:09:22,412
AND THE IMPACT THAT IT CAN HAVE
FOR CONSUMERS.

00:09:22,412 --> 00:09:23,632
ALL I WANT RIGHT NOW
IS SOME STREET MEAT

00:09:23,632 --> 00:09:24,582
WITH SOME
SOFT-SERVE ICE CREAM.

00:09:34,382 --> 00:09:36,482
I'M KATIE SANCHEZ.
AND I'M MELISSA ELMS.

00:09:36,482 --> 00:09:39,362
AND OUR COMPANY IS BASED
IN MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA.

00:09:39,362 --> 00:09:41,542
I'M ALWAYS KNOWN
MY WAY AROUND A KITCHEN.

00:09:41,542 --> 00:09:43,392
I'M A TRAINED PASTRY CHEF.

00:09:43,392 --> 00:09:44,552
SO TRYING NEW RECIPES,

00:09:44,552 --> 00:09:46,542
IT'S SOMETHING
THAT I'VE ALWAYS DONE.

00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:48,442
WOW.
PERFECT.

00:09:48,442 --> 00:09:49,592
I MET KATIE
AT A FOOD TRADE SHOW,

00:09:49,592 --> 00:09:52,532
AND WE DECIDED TO STICK TOGETHER
AND BECOME BUSINESS PARTNERS.

00:09:52,532 --> 00:09:54,502
pH OF 3.7.

00:09:54,502 --> 00:09:56,382
OUR PRODUCT
IS A SWEETENER

00:09:56,382 --> 00:09:58,422
THAT TASTES AND BAKES
LIKE TRADITIONAL HONEY,

00:09:58,422 --> 00:09:59,612
BUT WHAT MAKES IT
REALLY GREAT

00:09:59,612 --> 00:10:01,582
IS IT STEMS
FROM A DIFFERENT SOURCE.

00:10:01,582 --> 00:10:04,422
OUR GOAL IS
TO HELP SAVE THE BEES.

00:10:04,422 --> 00:10:07,472
UNFORTUNATELY, THE POPULATION
OF THESE TINY WORKERS

00:10:07,472 --> 00:10:08,622
IS IN DECLINE.

00:10:08,622 --> 00:10:11,582
OUR PRODUCT HELPS
TO GIVE THE BEES A BREAK,

00:10:11,582 --> 00:10:14,632
ALLOWS THEM TO REGAIN IN HEALTH
AND IN NUMBERS.

00:10:14,632 --> 00:10:16,372
WE'LL GET THAT ORDER
RIGHT OUT TO YOU.

00:10:16,372 --> 00:10:17,402
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:10:17,402 --> 00:10:19,512
WE'VE PUT EVERYTHING
INTO THIS BUSINESS --

00:10:19,512 --> 00:10:21,582
SPIRITUALLY, EMOTIONALLY,
AND FINANCIALLY.

00:10:21,582 --> 00:10:23,492
THIS BUSINESS
IS SO IMPORTANT

00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:26,432
'CAUSE IT'S GOING TO MAKE A
CHANGE IN THE SWEETENER MARKET,

00:10:26,432 --> 00:10:28,632
AND IT OFFERS A SOLUTION
TO MULTIPLE PROBLEMS,

00:10:28,632 --> 00:10:30,592
NOT JUST TODAY,
BUT FOR TOMORROW, AS WELL.

00:10:33,522 --> 00:10:36,532
♪♪

00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:49,622
HELLO, SHARKS.

00:10:49,622 --> 00:10:51,652
MY NAME'S KATIE SANCHEZ,

00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:54,602
AND I'M FROM MINNEAPOLIS,
MINNESOTA.

00:10:54,602 --> 00:10:57,582
AND I'M MELISSA ELMS,
FROM NOLANVILLE, TEXAS.

00:10:57,582 --> 00:10:59,492
AND WE ARE THE OWNERS
AND OPERATORS

00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,382
OF BEE FREE HONEE.

00:11:01,382 --> 00:11:05,402
WE ARE HERE SEEKING $100,000
FOR 10% EQUITY IN OUR COMPANY.

00:11:05,402 --> 00:11:08,532
SHARKS, WE'VE ALL HEARD
THE EXPRESSION "BUSY AS A BEE."

00:11:08,532 --> 00:11:10,482
THEY'RE BUSY FOR A REASON.

00:11:10,482 --> 00:11:12,652
IT TAKES OVER 60,000 BEES

00:11:12,652 --> 00:11:15,552
TO GATHER ENOUGH NECTAR
FOR ONE POUND OF HONEY.

00:11:15,552 --> 00:11:16,612
WOW.

00:11:16,612 --> 00:11:18,602
WELL,
WE AT BEE FREE HONEE SAY,

00:11:18,602 --> 00:11:19,652
LET'S GIVE THOSE BEES
A REST.

00:11:19,652 --> 00:11:21,602
THAT'S WHY
WE HAVE OUR LINE

00:11:21,602 --> 00:11:26,552
OF 100%-PLANT-BASED,
SUSTAINABLE HONEY.

00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:29,482
NO HIVES REQUIRED.
HOW DO WE DO IT?

00:11:29,482 --> 00:11:33,462
BEE FREE IS THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE
HONEY ON THE MARKET...

00:11:35,552 --> 00:11:37,422
...MADE FROM APPLES.

00:11:37,422 --> 00:11:39,562
WE MAKE ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS
IN OUR KITCHEN

00:11:39,562 --> 00:11:41,622
USING ONLY APPLES
GROWN IN THE U.S.A.

00:11:41,622 --> 00:11:44,522
BEE FREE HONEE
CAN BE USED ON BREADS,

00:11:44,522 --> 00:11:47,382
AS A TOPPING ON GRANOLAS
OR OATMEALS.

00:11:47,382 --> 00:11:50,372
YOU CAN USE BEE FREE HONEE
AS THE PERFECT SUBSTITUTE.

00:11:50,372 --> 00:11:52,652
SHARKS, WE INVITE YOU
TO ENJOY BEE FREE HONEE

00:11:52,652 --> 00:11:54,552
SO YOU CAN SEE
WHAT ALL THE "BUZZ" IS ABOUT.

00:11:55,642 --> 00:11:56,572
WE HAVE SOME SAMPLES.

00:11:58,582 --> 00:12:00,412
YOU CAN GRAB EITHER ONE.

00:12:00,412 --> 00:12:01,432
OKAY.

00:12:01,432 --> 00:12:03,462
THANK YOU.

00:12:03,462 --> 00:12:05,542
SO, WHAT YOU HAVE
IN FRONT OF YOU,

00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:08,402
IT'S 80% U.S.-GROWN
ORGANIC APPLE.

00:12:08,402 --> 00:12:10,482
LEMON JUICE IS
THE ONLY PRESERVATIVE.

00:12:10,482 --> 00:12:11,602
AND THEN THERE'S A TITCH

00:12:11,602 --> 00:12:15,422
OF VEGAN-QUALITY
NON-GMO CANE SUGAR.

00:12:15,422 --> 00:12:16,462
ONLY ENOUGH TO GIVE IT

00:12:16,462 --> 00:12:18,602
THE VISCOSITY
OF TRADITIONAL HONEY.

00:12:18,602 --> 00:12:20,562
AND THOSE ARE
THE THREE MAIN INGREDIENTS.

00:12:20,562 --> 00:12:22,432
IT TASTES GOOD, GUYS.

00:12:22,432 --> 00:12:23,472
OH, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

00:12:23,472 --> 00:12:24,632
IT TASTES LIKE HONEY.

00:12:24,632 --> 00:12:26,552
THIS STUFF IS
VERY, VERY GOOD.
THANK YOU.

00:12:26,552 --> 00:12:28,382
O'Leary: SO, KATIE, CAN I JUST
ASK YOU A BASIC QUESTION

00:12:28,382 --> 00:12:30,502
BEFORE WE GET INTO
AND DIVE DEEP INTO THIS?
SURE.

00:12:30,502 --> 00:12:33,652
WHY DOES
THE WORLD NEED THIS?

00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:36,502
Elms: NOT ONLY DOES IT HELP
WITH THE BEE POPULATION,

00:12:36,502 --> 00:12:39,512
BUT OUR VEGAN COMMUNITY
IS A BIG SUPPORTER OF OURS.

00:12:39,512 --> 00:12:42,442
VEGANS DO NOT EAT HONEY?
VEGANS DO NOT EAT HONEY.

00:12:42,442 --> 00:12:44,452
IT'S ONE OF THE MOST
CONTESTED INGREDIENTS

00:12:44,452 --> 00:12:46,422
IN THE VEGAN COMMUNITY
BY FAR.
WHY?

00:12:46,422 --> 00:12:48,382
IT COMES FROM AN ANIMAL,
AN INSECT.

00:12:48,382 --> 00:12:50,552
John:
YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY CAME ON HERE
LAST SEASON -- BEE THINKING.

00:12:50,552 --> 00:12:52,452
I TOOK
ONE OF THE HIVES HOME,

00:12:52,452 --> 00:12:55,532
AND I'VE BECOME NOW ABSOLUTELY,
TOTALLY OBSESSED WITH BEES.

00:12:55,532 --> 00:12:57,512
I HAVE A MILLION BEES
ON MY PROPERTY.

00:12:57,512 --> 00:12:59,602
AND I JUST KNOW SO MUCH
ABOUT THIS STUFF NOW.

00:12:59,602 --> 00:13:02,652
IF YOU TAKE OUT MORE
THAN ABOUT 20% OF THE HONEY,

00:13:02,652 --> 00:13:04,492
IT COULD
COLLAPSE THE HIVE.

00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,642
WHERE DOES THIS COMPARE PRICING
TO HONEY?

00:13:06,642 --> 00:13:09,362
Elms: IT'S AT THE SAME PRICE
OR LOWER,

00:13:09,362 --> 00:13:12,412
BUT IT COST US TO PRODUCE
$1.60 A UNIT.

00:13:12,412 --> 00:13:14,512
AND WE SELL IT FOR $5.99
A BOTTLE AT RETAIL.

00:13:14,512 --> 00:13:15,602
AND IS THAT
WHAT I WOULD PAY

00:13:15,602 --> 00:13:17,452
FOR ANOTHER JAR OF HONEY,
OR WHAT EXACTLY?

00:13:17,452 --> 00:13:20,432
YOU'D PROBABLY PAY
AROUND $10.99 AND UP.

00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,532
WOW.
AND WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?

00:13:22,532 --> 00:13:25,452
SO, WE'VE BEEN ON THE NATIONAL
MARKET NOW FOR TWO YEARS.

00:13:25,452 --> 00:13:28,382
WE ARE IN 9 OF THE 11 REGIONS
OF WHOLE FOODS.

00:13:28,382 --> 00:13:32,532
OUR SALES ARE THIS YEAR TO DATE
$104,000 IN REVENUE STREAM.

00:13:32,532 --> 00:13:34,452
LAST YEAR, $78,000,

00:13:34,452 --> 00:13:35,552
OUR FIRST YEAR
OUT OF THE GATE.

00:13:35,552 --> 00:13:38,432
WHY DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THIS
COMPANY IS WORTH $1 MILLION?

00:13:38,432 --> 00:13:39,602
WELL, WE'VE JUST
FINISHED TESTING

00:13:39,602 --> 00:13:42,462
WITH COSTCO IN THE BAY AREA,
AS WELL,

00:13:42,462 --> 00:13:44,502
AND WE ARE GOING -- WE'RE
WORKING ON PACKAGING RIGHT NOW

00:13:44,502 --> 00:13:47,482
FOR A ROLL-OUT WITH THEM
THIS LATE FALL.

00:13:47,482 --> 00:13:50,372
IF YOU WERE TO GET YOUR
INVESTMENT TODAY OF $100,000,

00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:52,632
IS THAT ENOUGH MONEY
TO CASH FLOW THOSE ORDERS?

00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:54,632
YES.
YES. YOU FEEL SO.
YOU'VE DONE THE NUMBERS?

00:13:54,632 --> 00:13:56,612
Sanchez: WE PUT EVERYTHING
BACK INTO THE COMPANY.

00:13:56,612 --> 00:13:58,562
YEAH, THE $100,000
IS GONNA BE FOR US

OUR OWN KITCHEN.

FOR A LARGER KITCHEN

YES, MA'AM.

CAP ON OUR SALES

00:14:04,412 --> 00:14:07,372

ON PRODUCTION HOURS.

A COUPLE OF RESTAURANTS.

00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:10,582
IF I TAKE THIS TO MY CHEF
AND SAY,

00:14:10,582 --> 00:14:12,612
"CHEF, DO YOU WANT TO USE THIS
IN YOUR PASTRIES?"

TO BEAT THAT

IF YOUR CHEF IS USING
ORGANIC, LOCAL HONEY,

00:14:21,552 --> 00:14:24,472
THEN OUR PRODUCT'S GONNA BE
OBVIOUSLY LOWER-PRICED.

00:14:24,472 --> 00:14:27,382

JUST HONEY OFF THE TRUCK?

RELATIVELY THE SAME PRICE.

00:41:05,542 --> 00:41:07,542
TO BE ABLE TO CREATE
THAT ACCELERATION.

00:41:07,542 --> 00:41:08,632
I'M OUT.

00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:11,432
THANK YOU, MARK.
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

00:41:13,572 --> 00:41:16,522
OKAY, MILES,
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

00:41:20,472 --> 00:41:23,512
UNFORTUNATELY, WE'RE
INTERESTED IN EQUITY PARTNERS

00:41:23,512 --> 00:41:25,602
THAT ARE GONNA BE FULLY INVESTED
IN THE COMPANY.

00:41:25,602 --> 00:41:28,482
WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE A BIG
BALLOON PAYMENT OVER OUR HEADS.
WOW.

00:41:28,482 --> 00:41:30,652
SO, UNFORTUNATELY,
UNLESS YOU WANT TO GO EQUITY,

00:41:30,652 --> 00:41:32,552
WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO DECLINE.

00:41:32,552 --> 00:41:35,432
WHEN YOU WALK OUT THAT DOOR,
IT'S OVER.

00:41:35,432 --> 00:41:38,392
AND YOU'RE GONNA GO HOME TONIGHT
AND CRY LIKE A BABY.

00:41:38,392 --> 00:41:40,452
WHEN YOU SAY NO
TO AN OFFER LIKE THAT,

00:41:40,452 --> 00:41:41,552
IT ACTUALLY SHOWS ME

00:41:41,552 --> 00:41:43,612
YOU DON'T HAVE AS MUCH
CONFIDENCE IN THE BUSINESS

00:41:43,612 --> 00:41:45,412
AS I THOUGHT YOU DID.
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

00:41:45,412 --> 00:41:47,602
SO, I HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE
IN THE BUSINESS.

00:41:47,602 --> 00:41:49,582
I DON'T HAVE
AS MUCH CONFIDENCE

00:41:49,582 --> 00:41:52,582
IN PAYING BACK $3 MILLION
EXACTLY WHEN HE NEEDS IT.

00:41:52,582 --> 00:41:54,372
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE NOT TAKING IT.

00:41:54,372 --> 00:41:55,502
I'M SHOCKED.

00:41:55,502 --> 00:41:56,632
I-I GOT TO SAY NO.

00:41:56,632 --> 00:41:58,572
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE
A DEAD SHIRT WALKING TO ME.

00:41:58,572 --> 00:42:02,382
TURN AROUND
AND GET OUT OF HERE.

00:42:02,382 --> 00:42:03,502
PLEASE JUST GO AWAY.

00:42:03,502 --> 00:42:05,462
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU, GUYS.
IT'S BEEN GREAT.

00:42:05,462 --> 00:42:06,512
TAKE CARE.

00:42:06,512 --> 00:42:09,532
♪♪

00:42:13,542 --> 00:42:17,412
I FEEL LIKE I GAVE OUT AN OFFER
THAT I KNEW WE COULD ACCEPT.

00:42:17,412 --> 00:42:19,602
UNFORTUNATELY, NONE OF
THE SHARKS TOOK ME UP ON IT,

00:42:19,602 --> 00:42:21,512
AND, YOU KNOW, I BENT AS MUCH

00:42:21,512 --> 00:42:23,482
AS I THOUGHT WAS REASONABLE
FOR OUR BUSINESS

00:42:23,482 --> 00:42:25,462
BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN IT SO MUCH
AND I KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING.
