THIS IS THE SHARK TANK,

00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,110
WHERE ENTREPRENEURS
SEEK AN INVESTMENT

00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:08,110

...THEY'LL INVEST
THEIR OWN MONEY...

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,150
THIS COULD BE
ONE OF THE BEST THINGS

00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,050
I'VE EVER SEEN
ON "SHARK TANK."

00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,160
...AND FIGHT EACH OTHER
FOR A DEAL.

00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,170
BING!
DID I HEAR ROYALTIES?

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,030

00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,190
-WAIT, MARK, RUDE.
-WHY?

00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,190
THE ENTREPRENEURS
MUST GET THE FULL AMOUNT

00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:31,010
THEY'RE ASKING FOR OR THEY'LL
WALK AWAY WITH NOTHING.

00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,051
YOU INVENTED THIS.

00:00:32,051 --> 00:00:33,120
THERE'S PEOPLE THAT
WATCH THINGS HAPPEN

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,010
AND PEOPLE THAT
MAKE THINGS HAPPEN.

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,120
HOLD ON.

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,040
ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.
YOU REMIND ME OF ME.

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,080
I'M GUESSING YOU DON'T HAVE

00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,080
A LOT OF ACCOUNTING TOOLS
BEHIND YOU.

00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,110
I CAN JUST
TAKE ALL THAT OVER.

00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,060
SO, DO WE HAVE A DEAL?

LET ME SHOW YOU

FIRST YOU CAN CHOOSE
A FOCUS AREA,

00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,140
THEN YOU WANT TO CHOOSE

I'M GONNA CHOOSE FULL BODY

THE PRECISE AMOUNT OF TIME

00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:52,010
THAT YOU HAVE TO EXERCISE.

AND MERGES THEM
INTO AN EXERCISE PLAY LIST.

00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,070

IF YOU NEED AN EXTRA BREAK,
YOU CAN HIT PAUSE.

00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,130
IF YOU COME TO A MOVE THAT YOU
CAN'T DO, WHATEVER THE REASON,

00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,150
YOU CAN SKIP THAT MOVE
JUST LIKE YOU'D SKIP A SONG

00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,100

SO,
WHO'S READY TO SWORKIT?

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,090
CAN YOU PUT MUSIC TO THIS?

00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,060

00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,160

SO,
THESE ARE YOUR MODELS?

YES, SO WE HAVE A BENCH OF

GREG IS ACTUALLY A CERTIFIED
PERSONAL TRAINER, AS WELL.

00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,110
WE MET
AT WHARTON BUSINESS SCHOOL.

00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,180
HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN IN BUSINESS?

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,060
SO, WE LAUNCHED SWORKIT
A YEAR AGO.

00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,190
WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN IN
THE HEALTH AND FITNESS SPACE

00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,180
FOR FIVE YEARS,
SO WE HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE

00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,140
IN UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
AND WHAT DOESN'T.

00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,170
WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS
WERE YOU IN?

00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,080
WE STARTED THE COMPANY
FIVE YEARS AGO.

00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,130
THIS IS OUR THIRD PRODUCT.

00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:00,080
-SO YOU STARTED FIVE YEARS AGO.
-YES.

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,200
-WITH A DIFFERENT PRODUCT.
-EXACTLY.

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,090
-OKAY, WHAT WAS --
-AND WHAT WAS THAT?
-YEAH.

00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,040
IT WAS A FITNESS TRACKER
CALLED NEXERCISE.

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,140
WE GREW IT TO
2 MILLION DOWNLOADS.

00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,190
-DID YOU MAKE MONEY?
-OH, YES.

00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:10,040
YES, WE DID. SO, DURING
THE ENTIRE LIFE OF COMPANY,

00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,150
WE'VE MADE
JUST UNDER $2 MILLION TOTAL.

00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,110
IF YOU LOOK AT
THE LAST 12 MONTHS,

00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,060
AS A COMPANY WE'VE MADE
$770,000.

00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,050
SWORKIT
REPRESENTS $460,000.

00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,090
Cuban:
AND THAT'S ALL PREMIUM UPGRADES,

00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,160
MOST OF WHICH ARE
GET RID OF THE ADVERTISING.

00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,050
SO, IT'S 2/3 UPGRADES,
1/3 ADVERTISING.

00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,110
THE APP'S FREE,

00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,431
AND THEN THERE'S AN UPGRADE
COMPONENT THAT PEOPLE BUY.

00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:28,531
-THAT'S RIGHT.
-YES.

00:04:28,531 --> 00:04:29,392
AND WHAT'S THE COST
FOR UPGRADE?

00:04:29,392 --> 00:04:30,140
IT'S $3.99
FOR THE PRO VERSION.

00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,190
YOU DON'T SEE ANY ADS,
AND IT'S MORE CUSTOMIZABLE.

00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,100
-IS IT AN ANNUAL CHARGE...
-$3.99 UPGRADE.

00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,090
...THAT'S MAINTAINED ON
A SUBSCRIPTION BASIS?

00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:39,170
NO, WE'RE INTRODUCING A
SUBSCRIPTION BASIS IN NOVEMBER,

00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:42,030
AND SO THAT WILL BE
$9.99 A MONTH.

00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,050
WE'RE REAL EXCITED
ABOUT THAT

00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,090
BECAUSE THAT'S GONNA INTRODUCE
PREMIUM CONTENT,

00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,110
SO IT'LL GIVE YOU ACCESS TO
ACTUAL EQUIPMENT.

00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,220
SO KETTLE BELLS,
EXERCISE BALL.

00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,170
Herjavec:
BUT, BENJAMIN, WHY ISN'T THAT
CONVERTING TO HIGHER SALES?

00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,130
WHY AREN'T
MORE OF THEM UPGRADING?

00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,200
BECAUSE THE FREE EXPERIENCE IS
ENOUGH FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON.

00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,190
AND WHAT WE DO IS
WE MONETIZE THOSE INDIVIDUALS

00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:01,030
THROUGH ADVERTISING, THROUGH
BANNERS AND INTERSTITIALS.

00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,120
YEAR TO DATE,
JUST TO GIVE YOU

00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,200
A SENSE OF HOW THIS IS GROWING,
RIGHT?

00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,130
SO, THE LAST 12 MONTHS,
THE REVENUE FROM SWORKIT

00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:09,030
HAS GROWN FROM ABOUT
$44,500 PER MONTH

00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,100
TO ABOUT $94,000 PER MONTH.
OKAY?

00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,080
SO, YOUR LAST THREE MONTHS,
YOU'VE DONE AT LEAST $90,000.

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,130
-THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT.
-YEAH, IT'S IMPRESSIVE.

00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:19,040
WE ARE THE CATEGORY LEADER IN
INSTRUCTIONAL EXERCISE FITNESS.

00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,040
WE REGULARLY SIT
IN THE TOP 10

00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,050
IN THE HEALTH AND FITNESS
CATEGORY...

00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,120
-YOU DO?
-...IN APPLE APP STORE.

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,230
HAVE YOU RAISE ANY MONEY
FROM INVESTORS?

00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:28,140
WE HAVE DONE ABOUT $2.1 MILLION
IN FINANCING TO DATE.

00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,100
AT WHAT VALUATION
ARE YOU DOING THAT?

00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,130
UH, $11 MILLION CAP.

00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,120
THE LAST PRICE APPRAISAL
WAS A CAP OF $11 MILLION.

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,060
SO WE BASED OUR VALUATION ON
EIGHT ACQUISITIONS

00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,120
THAT WE'VE SEEN
IN THIS SPACE,

00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,040
AND WE'RE THE LEADING CATEGORY
LEADER IN INSTRUCTIONAL FITNESS.

00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,070
WE HAVE OVER
1.5 MILLION ACTIVE --

00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,110
MONTHLY ACTIVE USERS
RIGHT NOW.

00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,040
WE STARTED, LIKE,
LOOKING AT THE INDUSTRY.

00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,210
WE'VE SEEN
BETWEEN 2% TO 9%

00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:52,020
IN A SUBSCRIPTIVE MODEL CONVERT,
RIGHT, OF ACTIVE USERS.

00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,050
AND WE LOOKED AT
MyFitnessPal,

00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,120
COMPANIES LIKE STRAVA,
ALL OF THESE THINGS.

00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,090
THERE'S A WILLINGNESS TO PAY
IN THAT CATEGORY.

00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,090
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF YOUR ADS
ARE BEING SOLD?

00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,090
UH, 72%.

00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,190
WE LOOKED AT BUY ADS
ON MyFitnessPal

00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,100
FOR ALYSSA'S HEALTHY COOKIES,
ONE OF MY COMPANIES.

00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,100
-YEAH.
-SO, YOU KNOW,
IT'S A VIABLE MARKET.

00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,090
IT WASN'T LIKE THERE WAS
A TON OF EXCESS INVENTORY.

00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,120
Greiner:
WHAT DO YOU NEED THE MONEY FOR?

00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,150
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
WITH IT?

00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,140
SO, WE'RE LOOKING AT DOUBLING
OUR ENGINEERING TEAM --

00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,020
THREE MORE ENGINEERS.
-WHY?

00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,140
-UH, SPEED.
-SPEED.

00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,090
SO, AND WE DIDN'T EVEN MENTION
THE COOL THING,

00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,160
IS WE ALREADY HAVE ON DECK
TO ROLL OUT SWORKIT KIDS.

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,210
WHICH IS WHAT YOU ACTUALLY SEE
ON THE LEFT.

00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:22,090
SO WE HAVE A KIDS VERSION THAT'S
GETTING READY TO COME OUT.

00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,100
-OH, THAT'S INTERESTING.
-LOOK, YOU'RE VERY CREDIBLE.

00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,170
I LOVE SUBSCRIPTION BUSINESSES.
-YES.

00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:28,090
BUT I DON'T WANT TO TAKE THE
RAMP RISK IN TERMS OF VALUATION.

00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,140
-I UNDERSTAND.
-YOU UNDERSTAND THAT.

00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,120
ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND.
OF COURSE.

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,090
ARE YOU WILLING,
JUST OUT OF INTEREST,

00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,100
TO PUT SOME DEBT
ON THIS BALANCE SHEET?

00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,120
BECAUSE YOU CAN DEFINITELY
CARRY IT

00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,020
AND NOT GIVE UP
AS MUCH EQUITY.

00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,090
MAN, WE --

00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:46,130
I WILL GIVE YOU
THE $1.5 MILLION IN DEBT,

00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:51,080
AND I WANT 2.75% EQUITY
ON CLOSING.

00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,010
THE DEBT IS OUT THERE AT 7.5%
FOR TWO YEARS,

00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:58,090
AND I WILL RETAIN THE 2.75%.

00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:01,040
THAT IS A VERY GOOD OFFER
FOR YOU GUYS.

00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,090
BUT WITHOUT
ANY STRATEGIC VALUE,

00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,110
AND THAT'S --
-YEAH, THAT'S --

00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,120
OKAY, GUYS, HE'S ANNOYING
THE HELL OUT OF ME.

00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,120
OKAY.
-YEAH, YEAH.

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,060
-I WANT TO MAKE AN OFFER.
-ALL RIGHT.

00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,150
OKAY. I LIKE IT.

00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,070
I THINK IT'S A GREAT PLATFORM.

00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,120
SO, I'LL OFFER YOU
THE $1.5 MILLION.

00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,130
I WANT 10%, RIGHT?

00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,210
SO NOT A BIG SWING.
-YEAH.

00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:23,130
PLUS, I WANT $1.5 MILLION WORTH
OF YOUR UNSOLD AD INVENTORY.

00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:27,130
SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS IF
ALL YOUR AD INVENTORY IS SOLD,

00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:30,040
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT FOR ME,
AND I'M FINE WITH THAT.

00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,170
BUT IF YOU HAVE
ANY INVENTORY LEFT,

00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:35,120
YOU'RE JUST GONNA SELL IT TO ME
AS PART OF MY CREDIT,

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,140
AND I GET
$1.5 MILLION WORTH.

00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,150
FOR HOW LONG
ARE YOU TAKING --

00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,100
UNTIL IT'S DONE,
UNTIL $1.5 MILLION'S DONE.

00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,060
I GET THE CREDIT.
-OKAY, SO I UNDERSTAND.

00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,160
Young: YOU WILL TAKE
THE EXCESS INVENTORY.

00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,060
BUT IT'S UNSOLD.
AND THEN
YOU'RE GETTING THE PAID BACK,

00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,150
SO IT DOESN'T COST YOU ANYTHING
UNTIL YOU RECOUP IT.

00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,090
IT -- IT DOES --
YOU KNOW, IT'S A WIN-WIN

00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:52,090
'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT LOSING
ANYTHING BY OFFERING IT TO ME

00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,130
AS VALUE TO MY COMPANIES
IF IT'S UNSOLD.

00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:56,180
AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE
AN INCENTIVE

00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,050
FOR ME TO ADVERTISE FOR THEM
AFTER I USE UP MY CREDIT.

00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,120
RIGHT. RIGHT.

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,010
Greiner: I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE
LISTENING TO EVERYTHING,

00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,080
JUST TAKING IT ALL IN.

00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,040
AND I WAS ON THE FENCE.

00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,180
I WAS THINKING $1.5 MILLION,

00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,150
KIND OF HIGH,
GONNA TAKE A WHILE.

00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,200
IS IT LUNCH YET?
IS IT LUNCH YET?

00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,100
-I ALSO THOUGHT TO MYSELF --
-LOOK, YOU -- YOU --

00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,080
ALSO THOUGHT TO MYSELF --
WAIT, MARK, RUDE.

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,280
MAKE THE CHOICE.

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,170
MARK, LET HER TALK.

00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,120
-WHY?
-I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF TALKING.

00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,150
I'VE GOT $1.5 MILLION
ON THE TABLE.
'CAUSE IT'S RESPECTFUL.

00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:28,020
-RIGHT.
-IT'S RESPECTFUL, LET HER TALK.

00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,290
SO, I'M THINKING,
I'LL GO BACK.

00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,210
THE RISK IS YOURS.

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,169
Narrator:

00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:04,149
-MARK, LET HER TALK.
-WHY?

00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:05,219
I'M IN THE MIDDLE

00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:13,129
THE RISK IS YOURS.

00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:16,359
SO, I'M THINKING 8% --
MNH.

00:09:16,359 --> 00:09:20,159
10%? MNH.

00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,179
YOU'RE MAKING ME WAIT
FOR THIS?

00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:25,129
FOR ME, I CAN'T SEE
YOUR VALUATION RIGHT NOW.

00:09:26,349 --> 00:09:29,149
I'M OUT.

00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:30,179

I LOVE THE IDEA.

00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:36,289
MY OFFER WAS GONNA BE
$1.5 MILLION FOR 16%.

00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:39,179
I THINK, UH,
MARK'S GOT A CLEVER OFFER.

00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:41,259
HE'S BUYING YOUR
UNUSED AD INVENTORY...

00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:43,119
-YEAH.

00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:47,209
I -- I CAN'T SEE IT AT 10%.

00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:50,139
I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST,
BUT I'M OUT.

00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:53,229
I EXERCISE
THREE SOLID HOURS A WEEK

00:09:53,229 --> 00:09:56,189
WITH A GREAT LUXURY
OF A PERSONAL TRAINER.

00:09:56,189 --> 00:09:59,169
MY ISSUE IS I KNOW I SHOULD BE
DOING IT FIVE DAYS A WEEK,

00:09:59,169 --> 00:10:00,259
AND THIS IS AN ISSUE
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE

00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:02,189
WHO TRULY WANT
TO STAY IN SHAPE.

00:10:02,189 --> 00:10:05,189
THIS IS LIKE
THE ANSWER TO MY PROBLEM.

00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:07,159
BUT I'M SITTING HERE
AND THINKING,

00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:11,139
"SHOULD I INVEST $1.5 MILLION
IN THIS BUSINESS

00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:12,189
AND MAYBE MAKE A KILLING?

00:10:12,189 --> 00:10:17,169
OR SHOULD I INVEST $3.99
AND GET IN REALLY GOOD SHAPE?

00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:18,289
[ LAUGHS ]
YOU CAN DO BOTH.

00:10:18,289 --> 00:10:22,209

SO, DO WE HAVE A DEAL?

Young:
MARK JUST ADDS STRATEGIC VALUE.

00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:44,199
HE'S CONNECTED INTO SPORTS.

00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:46,229

Gilpin: LORI BROUGHT ME ON QVC,

AND WE SOLD OUT
IN JUST EIGHT MINUTES.

00:11:21,219 --> 00:11:22,229
WHEN I PITCHED TO THE SHARKS,

00:11:22,229 --> 00:11:24,289
I HAD A LITTLE OVER $300,000
IN SALES.

00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:28,219
JUST FOUR MONTHS LATER,
WE'VE DONE $2 MILLION IN SALES.

00:11:28,219 --> 00:11:29,309
WE'VE GROWN TO 12 EMPLOYEES,

00:11:29,309 --> 00:11:32,219

00:11:32,219 --> 00:11:34,149
-Hi, Chris.

00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:35,249
IN ADDITION TO

PUT THIS NEXT TO
YOUR CREDIT CARS.

00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:49,189
IT BLOCKS THE RFID SCREEN.

00:11:49,189 --> 00:11:52,199
ROBERT AND HIS TEAM ARE
TOP EXPERTS ON CYBERSECURITY.

00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:54,189

SEARCH-ENGINE OPTIMIZATION,

00:11:54,189 --> 00:11:55,229

FOR THE INCREASE IN ORDERS.

00:11:56,289 --> 00:11:59,179
WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS REACH OUT
TO EVEN MORE COMPANIES.

00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:00,209
PITCHING ON "SHARK TANK"

00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,249
BUT NOW IT'S CHANGED MY LIFE.

00:12:03,249 --> 00:12:05,229

THE CONFIDENCE TO KNOW

00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:10,159
I WILL BE ABLE TO
PROVIDE FOR MY FAMILY

00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,259
FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:14,229
WHEN I WALK IN TO MY OFFICE
AND I SEE MY EMPLOYEES,

00:12:14,229 --> 00:12:16,239
I JUST GET THIS FEELING
THAT I'VE MADE IT.

00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:19,189
AND IT'S ALL BEEN POSSIBLE
BECAUSE OF "SHARK TANK."

00:14:03,229 --> 00:14:05,229
WE USE A VACUUM
10 TIMES MORE POWERFUL

00:14:05,229 --> 00:14:07,149
THAN YOUR VACUUM AT HOME.

00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:09,209
WE USE INFRARED HEAT
OZONE INDUCTION,

00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:11,289
AND WE ALSO HAVE AN OPTIONAL
ANTIMICROBIAL TREATMENT.

00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:14,189
WE CURRENTLY HAVE TWO TRUCKS
THAT ARE OUT RUNNING.

00:14:14,189 --> 00:14:16,229
YOU CALL US UP, WE GO OUT,
WE TAKE YOUR MATTRESS,

00:14:16,229 --> 00:14:19,189
WE PUT IT IN THE MACHINE,
AND IN 15 MINUTES, WE'RE DONE.

00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:21,099
MICHAEL,
CAN YOU DEMONSTRATE THIS?

00:14:21,099 --> 00:14:22,149
ABSOLUTELY.

00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:23,169
YOU CAN GET A TAN.

00:14:23,169 --> 00:14:26,189
THEN WE ALSO HIT IT
WITH A DRY STEAM.

00:14:26,189 --> 00:14:28,139
MICHAEL,
YOU INVENTED THIS?

00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:29,199
YES, SIR.

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,209
SO, ALMOST EIGHT YEARS AGO,
FELL ASLEEP ON MY MATTRESS.

00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:34,389
MY SHEETS WERE STILL
IN THE WASHING MACHINE,

00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:35,269
AND I WAS GROSSED OUT

00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:37,219
BY THE FACT THAT I WAS
LAYING ON MY MATTRESS.

00:14:37,219 --> 00:14:39,209
I STARTED DOING SOME RESEARCH
AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:41,159
IF THERE WAS ANYTHING OUT THERE
THAT EXISTS

00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:43,159
THAT WOULD ALLOW ME
TO CLEAN MY MATTRESS.

00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,269
AND FOR THE NEXT 7 1/2 YEARS,

00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:46,249
I STARTED DEVELOPING
THE TECHNOLOGY,

00:14:46,249 --> 00:14:48,269
AND 2 1/2 YEARS AGO,
I STARTED BUILDING THE PROTOTYPE

00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:50,179
IN MY GARAGE AT HOME.
-I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS.

00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:51,389
HOW OFTEN
DO YOU NEED TO DO THIS?

00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:52,279
SO, FOR RESIDENTIAL,

00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:54,259
WE RECOMMEND
EVERY SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR.

00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:58,209
FOR HOTELS, HOSPITALS,
SENIOR LIVING FACILITIES,

00:14:58,209 --> 00:14:59,249
IT'S MUCH MORE FREQUENT.

00:14:59,249 --> 00:15:01,289
DO YOU HAVE HOTELS THAT HAVE
SIGNED ON TO DO THIS?

00:15:01,289 --> 00:15:03,850
YES, WE'VE SERVICED
OVER 30 HOTELS.

00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,870
WHAT ABOUT REACHING OUT TO,
LIKE, MAJOR HOTEL CHAINS

00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:07,930
LIKE HILTON AND HYATT?

00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,289
SO WE'VE GOT SOME MEETINGS
THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN SET,

00:15:09,289 --> 00:15:14,189
AND WE ACTUALLY DID A PILOT FOR
THE FIRST QUARTER OF LAST YEAR

00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:18,199
AND SERVICED ONE HOSPITALITY
COMPANY'S MATTRESSES,

00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:21,269
AND IN THREE MONTHS,
SAVED THEM ALMOST $100,000.

00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:23,249
WELL, I WANT TO KNOW
HOW YOU DID THAT.
HOW DID YOU
SAVE THEM MONEY?

00:15:23,249 --> 00:15:25,309
WHAT WE DID IS WE WENT IN
AND WE SANITIZED THE MATTRESSES,

00:15:25,309 --> 00:15:27,289
WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO
HAVE BEEN REPLACED OR REMOVED.

00:15:27,289 --> 00:15:29,179
IT ACTUALLY TOOK THE STAINS
OUT FROM THE MATTRESS?

00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:30,189
ABSOLUTELY, YES.

00:15:30,189 --> 00:15:31,299
IT'S MORE MENTAL, THOUGH,
ISN'T IT?

00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:34,149
LIKE YOU SAID, YOU WERE
LAYING ON YOUR MATTRESS,

00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:35,199
YOUR SHEETS
WERE IN THE LAUNDRY.

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,279
WHY WERE YOU
SO GROSSED OUT?

00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:39,239
THERE'S A REASON WHY
YOU WEIGH LESS IN THE MORNING

00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:40,339
THEN WHEN YOU DO WHEN YOU
GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT.

00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:44,209
YOUR BODY'S SWEATING, SECRETING
ALL KINDS OF OTHER THINGS,

00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,369
SHEDDING DEAD SKIN CELLS.
-WELL, THAT'S WHAT THE SHEETS

00:15:45,369 --> 00:15:46,259
ARE FOR, NO?

00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:49,099
WELL, IMAGINE
CHANGING YOUR CLOTHES EVERY DAY

00:15:49,099 --> 00:15:50,169
AND NEVER TAKING A SHOWER.

00:15:50,169 --> 00:15:51,329
IN JUST A MATTER OF A WEEK,
YOU'D BE FILTHY.

00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:54,259
SO, CHANGING THE SHEETS ON YOUR
MATTRESS IS THE SAME PRINCIPLE.

00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:56,149
YOU CHANGE THE SHEETS,
YOU CHANGE THE SHEETS,

00:15:56,149 --> 00:15:57,209
BUT YOU NEVER
CLEAN YOUR MATTRESS.

00:15:57,209 --> 00:15:59,179
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST,
MICHAEL?

00:15:59,179 --> 00:16:01,189
SO, OUR STANDARD SERVICE
IS $89.95.

00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:02,209
-THAT'S ALL?
-YES.

00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:04,179
I THINK
YOU'RE CHARGING TOO LITTLE.

00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:06,239
YOU GOT TO GO GET IT
OUT OF THE HOUSE, RIGHT?

00:16:06,239 --> 00:16:08,550
RIGHT, SO, TYPICALLY,
WHEN WE GO OUT AND WE SERVICE,

00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,231
WE ALSO UPCHARGE FOR SPOT
TREATMENTS, STAIN TREATMENTS,

00:16:11,231 --> 00:16:12,131
ADDITIONAL
HEAT TREATMENTS.

00:16:12,131 --> 00:16:13,299
WHAT WERE YOUR SALES LAST YEAR
OR THIS YEAR?

00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:16,199
SO, SINCE WE LAUNCHED,
WE JUST PASSED PROOF OF CONCEPT,

00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:20,149
I ACTUALLY SOLD
THE FIRST FRANCHISE FOR $435,000

00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:22,209
AND USED THAT
TO CASH FLOW OPERATIONS.

00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:24,219
BUT WHAT WERE YOUR SALES
FROM YOUR TRUCK?

00:16:24,219 --> 00:16:27,239
OVER THE LAST 18 MONTHS, WE'VE
DONE OVER $100,000 IN SALES

00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:28,279
JUST WITH THE FIRST TRUCK.

00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,279
I'D LIKE YOU TO PITCH ME
AS A FRANCHISEE,

00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:33,149
A POTENTIAL FRANCHISEE.
GIVE ME THE NUMBERS.

00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:35,189
SO, OUR PROJECTIONS SHOW

00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:39,159
ABOUT A $75,000 A YEAR REVENUE
FOR YOUR FIRST YEAR.

00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:40,199
ONLY $75,000?

00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,249
ONLY $75,000.

00:16:41,249 --> 00:16:44,169
SO,
WHAT'S YOUR NET ON $75,000?

00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,770
RIGHT ABOUT BREAK EVEN.

00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,269
IT SEEMS LOW.

00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:50,249
TO MAKE $75,000 OFF
A SINGLE TRUCK,

00:16:50,249 --> 00:16:52,159
IT SEEMS REALLY LOW TO ME.
-YEAH, IT SEEMS REALLY LOW.

00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:53,259
WHY AREN'T YOU
MAKING MORE MONEY?

00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:55,299
THAT'S JUST LAUNCHING,
JUST GOING TO MARKET.

00:16:55,299 --> 00:16:59,219
WE'VE DONE OVER SIX FIGURES
WITH THE FIRST TRUCK ALREADY.

00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:01,239
AND FRANCHISING
AND THE MOBILE UNIT

00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:02,309
IS ONLY PART
OF THIS BUSINESS.

00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:05,279
WE'RE IN TALKS WITH HOSPITALS
NOW AND HIGH-VOLUME HOTELS,

00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,269
AND WE WILL LEASE
THAT MACHINE TO THEM

00:17:07,269 --> 00:17:09,289
AND GENERATE RECURRING REVENUE
AND ROYALTIES.

00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:13,179
BING! DID I HEAR ROYALTIES?
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:15,169
THEN WE'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT
OPERATING COSTS,

00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:16,199
INSURANCE, THE TRUCK, LOGISTICS.
-RIGHT.

00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:19,199
IF YOU WERE TO SELL YOUR MACHINE
TO A HOTEL CHAIN,

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,199
AND THAT HOTEL CHAIN SAYS,

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,199
"WE CLEAN OUR MATTRESSES
BY THIS SYSTEM."

00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:25,249
SO PART OF OUR CAMPAIGN

00:17:25,249 --> 00:17:27,660
IS OFFERING CLEAN SLEEP
CERTIFIED BEDS.

00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,680
SO YOU CAN GO INTO ANY
HOTEL ROOM IN THAT HOTEL,

00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,289
LIFT THE SHEETS,

00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:35,179
AND KNOW WHEN THAT MATTRESS
HAS BEEN SANITIZED.

00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,229
Corcoran: HOW DID YOU GET INTO
THIS BUSINESS, MICHAEL?

00:17:36,229 --> 00:17:39,389
SO, AT 14,
I RAN AWAY FROM HOME.

00:17:39,389 --> 00:17:41,289
I HAD $120 TO MY NAME.

00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:44,269
AND TRIED TO GET TO
SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS,

00:17:44,269 --> 00:17:47,189
AND I REALIZED THAT
I NEEDED MONEY TO EAT,

00:17:47,189 --> 00:17:49,119
AND I NEEDED TO HEAD SOUTH.

00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:51,209
SO $80 GOT ME TO DALLAS, TEXAS.

00:17:51,209 --> 00:17:53,329
I GRABBED A PHONEBOOK.
I TRIED CALLING MY AUNT.

00:17:53,329 --> 00:17:57,239
I SAID, "HEY, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU KNOW ME OR REMEMBER ME,

00:17:57,239 --> 00:18:00,149
BUT I NEED A PLACE TO STAY.

00:18:00,149 --> 00:18:01,229
I'M TRYING TO GET TO
SAN ANTONIO."

00:18:01,229 --> 00:18:05,149
SO SHE CAME AND PICKED ME WITH
MY BLACK TRASH BAG OF CLOTHES,

00:18:05,149 --> 00:18:06,199
TOOK ME TO
MY GRANDPARENTS' HOUSE,

00:18:06,199 --> 00:18:08,189
AND THAT'S WHERE
I CHANGED MY LIFE.

00:18:08,189 --> 00:18:10,259
I REALIZED WHEN I WAS DRIVING,
STARING OUT THE WINDOW

00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:12,299
THAT THERE'S TWO TYPES OF PEOPLE
IN THIS WORLD.

00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,269
THERE'S PEOPLE THAT
WATCH THINGS HAPPEN

00:18:14,269 --> 00:18:16,229
AND PEOPLE THAT
MAKE THINGS HAPPEN.

00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:18,159
AND I REALIZED THAT
I WANTED TO BE SOMEBODY

00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:20,159
THAT WAS GONNA
MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN.

00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:21,269
AND SO FROM THEN ON,
I CHANGED MY LIFE.

00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:24,239
AT 16 YEARS OLD,
I GOT HIRED ON BY BOEING

00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:27,149
AND WENT THROUGH SIX DIFFERENT
FIELDS OF ENGINEERING WITH THEM

00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:28,209
AND DID THAT FOR 5 1/2 YEARS

00:18:28,209 --> 00:18:30,249
AND REALIZED THAT WORKING
FOR SOMEBODY ELSE WASN'T FOR ME.

00:18:30,249 --> 00:18:32,199
YOU'RE
A MECHANICAL ENGINEER?

00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:35,239
UM, THAT'S MY BACKGROUND.
I DID NOT...SECURE A DEGREE.

00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,289
I ACTUALLY SWITCHED
TO ENTREPRENEURSHIP.

00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:39,159
YOU JUST DID THIS STUFF -- YOU
DID THIS ALL ON OUR OWN, RIGHT?

00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,219
YES. I'VE GOT A MASTERS DEGREE
IN GOOGLE

00:18:41,219 --> 00:18:43,099
WITH A MINOR IN YAHOO
AND BING.

00:18:43,099 --> 00:18:44,199
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:18:44,199 --> 00:18:45,279
SO...
-WHAT'S YOUR BIG PLAN?

00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:47,149
YOU'RE ASKING FOR
A LOT OF MONEY.

00:18:47,149 --> 00:18:48,179
HOW ARE WE GONNA
MAKE MONEY BACK?

00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:49,189
HOW MUCH MONEY
ARE WE GONNA MAKE?

00:18:49,189 --> 00:18:50,219
AND HOW ARE YOU GONNA
GET US THERE?

00:18:50,219 --> 00:18:52,199
SO, THE WAY YOU'RE GONNA MAKE
MONEY

00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:54,239
IS WE'RE GONNA START
LEASING THESE MACHINES

00:18:54,239 --> 00:18:58,139
INTO HOSPITALS, INTO MILITARY
AND AIR FORCE BASES,

00:18:58,139 --> 00:18:59,179
INTO HIGH-VOLUME HOTELS.

00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,209
WHY HAVEN'T YOU DONE THAT
ALREADY?

00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:02,149
WE JUST PASSED
PROOF OF CONCEPT,

00:19:02,149 --> 00:19:03,239
AND I'M IN NEGOTIATIONS
RIGHT NOW.

00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:05,259
MICHAEL, WHAT DO YOU NEED
MY MILLION AND A HALF FOR?

00:19:05,259 --> 00:19:07,249
WE'RE GONNA BUILD
A COUPLE OF THE MACHINES

00:19:07,249 --> 00:19:09,389
SO THAT WE CAN GO OUT
AND DO A PILOT IN A HOSPITAL.

00:19:09,389 --> 00:19:10,279
AND --
-WHY?

00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:12,239
WHY DO YOU NEED TO DO A PILOT
IN A HOSPITAL?

00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:14,239
SO THAT WE CAN SHOW THEM
THAT WE CAN REDUCE

00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:16,229
INFECTIOUS DISEASES,
CROSS CONTAMINATION.

00:19:16,229 --> 00:19:18,209
I -- I GET WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH,

00:19:18,209 --> 00:19:20,189
BUT AREN'T YOU A LITTLE BIT
TOO EARLY?

00:19:20,189 --> 00:19:21,219
EARLY IN WHAT SENSE?

00:19:21,219 --> 00:19:23,179
IN THE SENSE THAT
YOU'VE GOT PROOF OF CONCEPT,

00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:24,289
BUT YOU'RE STILL
AT THAT INTEREST PHASE

00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:26,259
AS OPPOSED TO THAT
CLOSE THE DEAL PHASE.

00:19:26,259 --> 00:19:29,189
SO, THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO
BRING ON, YOU KNOW,

00:19:29,189 --> 00:19:31,229
PEOPLE WITH STRATEGIC
PARTNERSHIPS AND RELATIONSHIPS.

00:19:31,229 --> 00:19:33,219
THERE'S TWO TYPES OF
PROOF OF CONCEPT.

00:19:33,219 --> 00:19:36,099
ONE IS,
DOES THE TECHNOLOGY WORK?

00:19:36,099 --> 00:19:37,159
YOU'VE DONE THAT.

00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:38,239
THE SECOND
PROOF OF CONCEPT IS,

00:19:38,239 --> 00:19:40,229
IS THE MARKET
GONNA ACCEPT IT?

00:19:40,229 --> 00:19:42,129
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'VE DONE THAT.

00:19:42,129 --> 00:19:43,149
-SURE, SO --
-YOU HAVEN'T EVEN PROVEN

00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:45,169
THAT THE MOBILE MODEL WORKS

00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:47,129
BECAUSE
IT DOESN'T MAKE ENOUGH MONEY.

00:19:48,149 --> 00:19:49,329
MICHAEL, WHEN YOU FIRST
STARTED SPEAKING HERE,

00:19:49,329 --> 00:19:53,209
I WAS ACTUALLY, "WHOA, I DIDN'T
KNOW MY MATTRESS WAS DIRTY.

00:19:53,209 --> 00:19:55,179
I'M GONNA GET ALL MY MATTRESSES
CLEANED."

00:19:55,179 --> 00:19:57,189
WE'RE GETTING THIS
RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING,

00:19:57,189 --> 00:19:59,259
BUT THE MORE YOU TALK,
THE MORE I REALIZE

00:19:59,259 --> 00:20:02,269
I'M A LONG WAY AWAY FROM THE
MONEY AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL.

00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:03,289
IT'S NOT THE KIND OF --
-I'M JUST TRYING TO

00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:05,249
COVER ALL MY BASES
AND EXPLAIN TO YOU GUYS.

00:20:05,249 --> 00:20:08,139
YES, BUT FOR ME,
IT'S FAR TOO CONFUSING

00:20:08,139 --> 00:20:10,139
AND A LOT OF MONEY,
SO I'M OUT.

00:20:10,139 --> 00:20:11,209
OKAY,
THANK YOU, BARBARA.

00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:14,309
YOU SEEMED LIKE A VERY FOCUSED
GUY WHEN YOU FIRST CAME IN.

00:20:14,309 --> 00:20:18,189
I KNOW YOU THINK YOU WERE
GIVING ME MORE OPPORTUNITIES.

00:20:18,189 --> 00:20:20,189
-RIGHT.
-BUT THE LONGER YOU TALKED,

00:20:20,189 --> 00:20:22,279

FOR YOUR TIME.

00:34:09,755 --> 00:34:11,525
GOOD JOB, BENJAMIN.

00:34:11,525 --> 00:34:13,515
-NICE JOB.
-WAY TO KILL IT.

00:34:13,515 --> 00:34:14,575
WHAT GRADE ARE YOU IN?

00:34:14,575 --> 00:34:16,475
I'M AN 11th GRADER.

00:34:16,475 --> 00:34:17,495
I'M 16.

00:34:17,495 --> 00:34:18,515
MY BUBBE'S 80.

00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:19,575
GOOD JOB, BUBBE.

00:34:19,575 --> 00:34:21,605
-LOOKS LIKE CHOCOLATE BALLS.
-OH, IT'S INTERESTING.

00:34:21,605 --> 00:34:24,515
SO, IT TURNS INTO
A POWDER ESSENTIALLY.

00:34:24,515 --> 00:34:25,555
IT TURNS INTO A POWDER

00:34:25,555 --> 00:34:28,555
WHICH BREAKS DOWN
TO A REGULAR SHAMPOO PRODUCT.

00:34:28,555 --> 00:34:30,635
SO, BENJAMIN, ONE DAY
YOU'RE WASHING BUBBE'S HAIR...

00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:32,555
-YEAH.
-...AND IT HITS YOU --

00:34:32,555 --> 00:34:33,655
"I NEED TO COME UP WITH
A BETTER PRODUCT."

00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:36,535
AND THE IDEA WAS
"I'M GONNA MAKE A SHAMPOO

00:34:36,535 --> 00:34:37,615
WITH ABSOLUTELY
NO BOTTLE."

00:34:37,615 --> 00:34:39,685
YEAH, JUST LIKE
THE DISHWASHER DETERGENT TABLET.

00:34:39,685 --> 00:34:41,675
THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING OF
WHEN I THOUGHT OF NOHBO.

00:34:41,675 --> 00:34:43,655
HOW LONG AGO DID YOU HAVE
THE BRILLIANT IDEA?

00:34:43,655 --> 00:34:47,555
I THOUGHT OF NOHBO
IN JANUARY OF 2014.

00:34:47,555 --> 00:34:48,655
IN JULY OF 2014,

00:34:48,655 --> 00:34:51,605
I CONTACTED CLOROX COMPANY'S
HEADHUNTER GROUP.

00:34:51,605 --> 00:34:53,575
THEY WERE INTERESTED IN
A LICENSING DEAL

00:34:53,575 --> 00:34:55,525
ONCE NOHBO'S PATENT
WAS GRANTED.

00:34:55,525 --> 00:34:56,575
WE'RE PATENT-PENDING
RIGHT NOW.

00:34:56,575 --> 00:34:58,525
YOU'RE KI-- SO YOU JUST CALLED
THEM UP OUT OF THE BLUE.

00:34:58,525 --> 00:34:59,575
UH, WELL --

00:34:59,575 --> 00:35:01,505
THAT'S HOW HE IS.
[ LAUGHS ]

00:35:01,505 --> 00:35:02,685
YEAH, BENJAMIN!

00:35:02,685 --> 00:35:05,515
-THANK YOU.
-EVERYBODY SAYS
YOU GOT TO KNOW SOMEBODY.

00:35:05,515 --> 00:35:06,535
YEAH, BENJAMIN.
-YEAH, I CAN'T TELL YOU

00:35:06,535 --> 00:35:07,625
HOW MANY PEOPLE COME IN HERE
AND SAY,

00:35:07,625 --> 00:35:10,635
"I NEED YOUR HELP TO MAKE A CALL
TO THIS COMPANY."

00:35:10,635 --> 00:35:12,545
AND THERE YOU ARE.
YOU JUST CALLED THEM UP.

00:35:12,545 --> 00:35:13,555
GOOD FOR YOU.
-YEAH.

00:35:13,555 --> 00:35:15,515
WE'VE TALKED TO
MANY MAJOR CORPORATIONS.

00:35:15,515 --> 00:35:16,605
AND SO THEY SAID TO YOU
WHAT?

00:35:16,605 --> 00:35:19,595
HYATT HOTELS WANTS SAMPLES
OF NOHBO RIGHT NOW.

00:35:19,595 --> 00:35:22,565
HOW DID YOU REACH THE RIGHT
PERSON AT THE HOTEL CHAIN?

00:35:22,565 --> 00:35:24,515
THAT WOULD BE A MOST
INTIMIDATING CALL

00:35:24,515 --> 00:35:25,525
FOR EVEN A GROWN-UP.

00:35:25,525 --> 00:35:27,655
WELL,
I FOUND THE C.E.O.'s E-MAIL,

00:35:27,655 --> 00:35:30,555
AND THEN, UM, I TOLD THEM
I HAD A BETTER WAY

00:35:30,555 --> 00:35:32,685
FOR THEM TO, UM, USE SHAMPOO
OR CONDITIONER BOTTLES.

00:35:32,685 --> 00:35:35,605
SO YOU JUST SAID "I HAVE
SOMETHING BETTER, CHEAPER..."

00:35:35,605 --> 00:35:37,555
YEAH.
HE SAID HE WANTED SAMPLES.

00:35:37,555 --> 00:35:39,645
DID YOU HAVE THE SAMPLES
TO SEND?
NO.

00:35:39,645 --> 00:35:42,565
HOW DID YOU HANDLE THE RESPONSE
TO YOUR E-MAIL?

00:35:42,565 --> 00:35:43,605
"SORRY, I DON'T HAVE ANY,"
OR...

00:35:43,605 --> 00:35:47,046
I SAID, UM, "I AM CURRENTLY
PRODUCING NOHBO BALLS.

00:35:47,046 --> 00:35:50,266
I WILL SEND THEM TO YOU
AS SOON AS I AM ABLE TO."

00:35:50,266 --> 00:35:50,655
GOOD FOR YOU.

00:35:50,655 --> 00:35:52,695
SO HOW DO YOU GO TO
ACTUALLY MAKING IT?

00:35:52,695 --> 00:35:56,665
I CONTACTED A CHEMIST THROUGH
A FREELANCING ADVERTISEMENT.

00:35:56,665 --> 00:36:00,515
AND, UH, I GOT A JOB AT 14
TO HELP PAY FOR

00:36:00,515 --> 00:36:02,565
SOME OF THE INITIAL EXPENSES
OF NOHBO.

00:36:02,565 --> 00:36:04,575
UM, THERE'S ONLY SO --
-ONE SECOND. HOLD ON.

00:36:04,575 --> 00:36:06,525
-YEAH.
-[ LAUGHS ]

00:36:06,525 --> 00:36:08,535
GET THE JOB
TO PAY FOR THE EXPENSES

00:36:08,535 --> 00:36:09,595
FOR YOUR COMPANY
YOU WANT TO START.

00:36:09,595 --> 00:36:13,515
YEAH. SO WE ARE INDIVIDUALLY
HAND-PRESSING EACH BALL.

00:36:13,515 --> 00:36:14,545
THAT'S WHAT --
-IN YOUR HOUSE?

00:36:14,545 --> 00:36:16,475
IN BUBBE'S HOUSE?
-NO, NOT IN MY HOUSE.

00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:17,605
THE CHEMIST HAND-PRESSES IT.

00:36:17,605 --> 00:36:19,575
BECAUSE YOU NEED
A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PRESSURE.

00:36:19,575 --> 00:36:23,475
EVERY ONE OF THESE, AS YOU CAN
PROBABLY TELL, ARE HANDMADE.

00:36:23,475 --> 00:36:24,645
COULD A SHAMPOO COMPANY SAY

00:36:24,645 --> 00:36:27,515
"WE'RE GONNA MAKE
A DIFFERENT MEMBRANE

00:36:27,515 --> 00:36:29,605
USING OUR OWN SHAMPOO
AS A POWDER"?

00:36:29,605 --> 00:36:30,675
I MEAN, IT'S POSSIBLE,

00:36:30,675 --> 00:36:34,525
BUT A PATENT IS ONLY AS STRONG
AS YOUR ABILITY TO DEFEND IT,

00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,565
AND I BELIEVE
THIS IS VERY DEFENDABLE,

00:36:36,565 --> 00:36:37,595
AND WE CAN BUILD A BRAND --

00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:40,515
YOU HAVE IT WRAPPED
IN ALUMINUM FOIL.

00:36:40,515 --> 00:36:41,605
TO ME, IT LOOKS LIKE
A CHOCOLATE CANDY.

00:36:41,605 --> 00:36:43,675
THAT PACKAGING THAT YOU SEE
RIGHT THERE IS ONLY TEMPORARY.

00:36:43,675 --> 00:36:48,495
ULTIMATELY, WE WANT TO USE SOME
SORT OF PLANT PLASTIC PACKAGING

00:36:48,495 --> 00:36:49,525
THAT COMPOSTS PRETTY QUICKLY

00:36:49,525 --> 00:36:50,635
TO ALIGN WITH
THE ENVIRONMENTAL VISION.

00:36:50,635 --> 00:36:53,475
WHERE ARE YOU
ON THE PATENT PROCESS?

00:36:53,475 --> 00:36:54,545
SO WE ARE
PATENT-PENDING.

00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,545
WE HAVE FILED
TWO PROVISIONAL PATENTS.

00:36:56,545 --> 00:36:57,645
HOWEVER,
I DON'T HAVE THE CAPITAL

00:36:57,645 --> 00:37:00,595
TO CONVERT THOSE PATENTS
INTO NON-PROVISIONAL.

00:37:00,595 --> 00:37:04,515
AND IS THAT THE ENTIRE INVENTORY
OF WHAT YOU'VE CREATED SO FAR?

00:37:04,515 --> 00:37:06,545
-UH, SADLY, YES.
-[ LAUGHS ]

00:37:06,545 --> 00:37:07,595
-OKAY. SO --
-IT'S EXPENSIVE

00:37:07,595 --> 00:37:08,655
TO PAY A CHEMIST.
-BENJAMIN, THIS IS AN IDEA --

00:37:08,655 --> 00:37:11,525
ONE SECOND. BEFORE YOU MOVE ON,
CAN I SEE ONE OF THE BOXES?

00:37:11,525 --> 00:37:12,545
YEAH, SURE.

00:37:12,545 --> 00:37:13,585
WHY IS IT CALLED NOHBOO?

00:37:13,585 --> 00:37:14,625
-NOHBO.
-NOHBO?

00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:17,565
"NOHBO" IS ACTUALLY
"NO HAIR BOTTLES" SHORTENED.

00:37:17,565 --> 00:37:19,575
O'Leary: IS THERE A CHALLENGE
HERE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT

00:37:19,575 --> 00:37:22,565
THE MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR
SHAMPOO MARKET?

00:37:22,565 --> 00:37:24,495
UH, THAT'S THE BEAUTY
OF THIS PRODUCT.

00:37:24,495 --> 00:37:25,555
WE'RE NOT MAKING ONLY SHAMPOO,

00:37:25,555 --> 00:37:27,565
BUT WE'RE CREATING
A DELIVERY SYSTEM.

00:37:27,565 --> 00:37:30,605
WE CAN LICENSE THIS TECHNOLOGY
TO MAJOR SHAMPOO COMPANIES.

00:37:30,605 --> 00:37:33,555
WE CAN LICENSE IT TO L'OREAL,
WE CAN LICENSE IT TO PANTENE.

00:37:33,555 --> 00:37:35,525
SO TELL US ABOUT THE ECONOMICS,
BENJAMIN.

00:37:35,525 --> 00:37:36,615
I'VE ONLY GOTTEN
PRICING MODELS

00:37:36,615 --> 00:37:39,605
FOR A VERY SMALL QUANTITY
OF ORDERS, WHICH IS 100,000.

00:37:39,605 --> 00:37:41,545
THAT'S 6 CENTS TO PRODUCE.

00:37:41,545 --> 00:37:42,585
THAT'S THE MATERIAL COST.

00:37:42,585 --> 00:37:44,645
MY CHEMIST ACTUALLY HAS
WORKED WITH A MACHINE

00:37:44,645 --> 00:37:48,505
THAT CAN LITERALLY SPIT OUT
THOUSANDS OF THESE NOHBO BALLS.

00:37:48,505 --> 00:37:49,565
THAT'LL DRIVE DOWN OUR COSTS.

00:37:49,565 --> 00:37:51,625
ULTIMATELY, WE WANT THE COST
TO BE AROUND 4 CENTS TO MAKE.

00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:54,495
IF WE CAN GET THIS PRICE
DOWN TO 4 CENTS

00:37:54,495 --> 00:37:55,595
AND WE CAN SELL FOR 12 CENTS,

00:37:55,595 --> 00:37:57,625
AND THESE SHAMPOO BOTTLES
IN HOTELS --

00:37:57,625 --> 00:37:59,545
OKAY, LET'S PUT ASIDE HOTELS,
RIGHT? FOR A MINUTE.

00:37:59,545 --> 00:38:00,555
-OKAY.
-OKAY.

00:38:00,555 --> 00:38:02,545
I GET WHY
YOU WANT TO DO IT IN HOTELS.

00:38:02,545 --> 00:38:03,635
BUT
TO WHAT WAS SAID EARLIER,

00:38:03,635 --> 00:38:06,625
THERE'S A TRAINING PERSPECTIVE
IN A HOTEL.

00:38:06,625 --> 00:38:10,665
WHAT THE HOTELS DON'T WANT IS
SOMEONE TO LOOK FOR THE SHAMPOO

00:38:10,665 --> 00:38:13,615
AND THEN HAVE TO CALL DOWNSTAIRS
AND GET AN EXPLANATION.

00:38:13,615 --> 00:38:15,755
-SO --
-LET ME FINISH, RIGHT?

00:38:15,755 --> 00:38:17,575
THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE IS

00:38:17,575 --> 00:38:20,595
YOU SELL THEM FOR EVERYBODY WHO
IS ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS.

00:38:20,595 --> 00:38:23,615
THEY WILL JUST BUY THE PRODUCT
ONLINE, IN WHOLE FOODS --

00:38:23,615 --> 00:38:25,635
ARE YOU GONNA LET HIM LICENSE
THIS TO PANTENE OR NOT?

00:38:25,635 --> 00:38:28,585
I WOULD LET HIM,
BUT HOTELS ARE HARDER

00:38:28,585 --> 00:38:30,635
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO
EDUCATE THE CONSUMER.

00:38:30,635 --> 00:38:32,615
-OKAY, BENJAMIN.
-YOU ARE BRILLIANT.

00:38:32,615 --> 00:38:34,485
-THANK YOU.
-YOU CAME IN,

00:38:34,485 --> 00:38:35,655
REALLY AMAZED ALL OF US.

00:38:35,655 --> 00:38:38,665
THROUGH MY WHOLE CAREER,
ONE THING I'VE ALWAYS LEARNED --

00:38:38,665 --> 00:38:44,535
NEVER SELL SOMETHING
IF YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY READY

00:38:44,535 --> 00:38:46,575
BECAUSE
YOU GET ONE SHOT.

00:38:46,575 --> 00:38:48,595
I THINK, YOU KNOW,
YOU PROBABLY ARE GONNA BE

00:38:48,595 --> 00:38:50,625
FINESSING IT,
PERFECTING IT.

00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:54,565
RIGHT NOW, IT'S TOO EARLY
FOR ME TO BE INVOLVED.

00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:56,525
I'M OUT.

00:38:56,525 --> 00:38:57,585
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,535
I LOOK AT
THE PERSONAL-CARE MARKET.

00:38:59,535 --> 00:39:01,565
MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR BRAND
IS EVERYTHING.

00:39:01,565 --> 00:39:02,685
I USE
A CERTAIN SHAMPOO BRAND

00:39:02,685 --> 00:39:05,595
TO KEEP THESE BEAUTIFUL LOCKS
EXACTLY THE WAY THEY LOOK.

00:39:05,595 --> 00:39:06,605
HOW'S THAT
WORKED OUT FOR YOU?

00:39:06,605 --> 00:39:08,545
-IT'S LOOKING GREAT.
-IT FELL OUT.

00:39:08,545 --> 00:39:09,575
[ LAUGHTER ]
I LOOK SPECTACULAR.

00:39:09,575 --> 00:39:10,635
ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR.

00:39:10,635 --> 00:39:13,575
THIS IS DELIVERY MECHANISM --
THE PATENT IS EVERYTHING.

00:39:13,575 --> 00:39:16,485
I KIND OF AGREE WITH
MR. HERJAVEC OVER THERE.

00:39:16,485 --> 00:39:17,575
I THINK
IT'S A LONG JOURNEY.

00:39:17,575 --> 00:39:20,465
I'M GONNA STICK WITH MY BRAND,
KEEP MY BEAUTIFUL LOCKS,

00:39:20,465 --> 00:39:21,505
BUT I'M OUT.

00:39:21,505 --> 00:39:22,725
THANK YOU.

00:39:24,555 --> 00:39:27,645
IF THE PATENT IS REAL,
YOUR OFFER IS VERY GOOD.

00:39:27,645 --> 00:39:31,595
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $100,000 FOR 20%,

00:39:31,595 --> 00:39:33,515
BUT IT'S AN OPTION.

00:39:33,515 --> 00:39:35,565
I WANT TO WAIT
TILL THE PATENT'S GRANTED,

00:39:35,565 --> 00:39:37,535
AND I WANT TO DO
A LICENSING DEAL.

00:39:37,535 --> 00:39:41,515
THE PATH I SEE
IS YOU LICENSE IT

00:39:41,515 --> 00:39:43,605
WITH AN OPTION
TO STILL SELL

00:39:43,605 --> 00:39:46,555
TO CERTAIN SECTORS OF THE MARKET
ON YOUR OWN.

00:39:46,555 --> 00:39:48,535
THESE COMPANIES --

00:39:48,535 --> 00:39:49,605
THEY WILL MAKE
MILLIONS OF THEM

00:39:49,605 --> 00:39:51,585
AT A COST
YOU CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE.

00:39:51,585 --> 00:39:53,575
YOU USE THAT MONEY
TO FUND IT,

00:39:53,575 --> 00:39:55,605
AND IF YOU WANT,
GO BUILD A BRAND.

00:39:55,605 --> 00:39:58,545
OKAY.
THAT'S MY OFFER,
BUT IT'S REALLY AN OPTION.

00:39:58,545 --> 00:40:00,475
Cuban: YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:40:00,475 --> 00:40:01,505
LOOK, I LOVE IT.

00:40:15,515 --> 00:40:16,575
Narrator: TWO SHARKS ARE OUT.

00:40:16,575 --> 00:40:19,525
BENJAMIN HAS ONE OFFER
ON THE TABLE FOR NOHBO,

00:40:19,525 --> 00:40:21,615
HIS ECO-FRIENDLY SHAMPOO BALLS.

00:40:21,615 --> 00:40:23,605
BUT MARK ALSO SEEMS INTERESTED.

00:40:23,605 --> 00:40:26,745
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LOOK, I LOVE IT.

00:40:28,605 --> 00:40:30,625
ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.
YOU REMIND ME OF ME, YOU KNOW?

00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:33,555
I HAD A GUY, ZACH PILOSOFT,
WHO WHEN I WAS 16,

00:40:33,555 --> 00:40:35,535
HELPED ME
FUND MY OWN BUSINESS

00:40:35,535 --> 00:40:38,545
AND GOT ME STARTED
AND REALLY DID A LOT FOR ME.

00:40:38,545 --> 00:40:39,655
HERE IS MY OFFER.

00:40:39,655 --> 00:40:42,565
I'VE GOT TOO MANY LAWYERS
THAT WORK FOR ME,

00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:45,585
SO HELPING WITH THE PATENT
IS EASY.

00:40:45,585 --> 00:40:48,635
I ALSO HAVE HOT TOT,
WHICH IS A SHAMPOO COMPANY

00:40:48,635 --> 00:40:50,645
THAT'S GEARED TOWARDS
YOUNG KIDS,

00:40:50,645 --> 00:40:55,495
UM, AND I'VE ALSO GOT KISSTIXX
THAT DOES OEM MANUFACTURING.

00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:56,565
IN ADDITION, I'M GUESSING

00:40:56,565 --> 00:40:58,595
YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF
ACCOUNTING TOOLS BEHIND YOU.

00:40:58,595 --> 00:40:59,635
I COULD JUST
TAKE ALL THAT OVER.

00:40:59,635 --> 00:41:05,515
ALL THAT SAID,
I'D OFFER YOU $100,000 FOR 25%.
