00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,010
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THAT STATEMENT, DAYMOND --

00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:57,040
THAT IT'S PROTECTABLE
BY BRAND ALONE?

00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,240
THAT IT'LL PROTECT HER.

00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,100
NO. NOT AT ALL.

00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,030
I THINK THAT SHE HAS
A GREAT FOLLOWING,

00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,080
BUT IF ANOTHER MAKER --

00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,100
AND THEY <i>WILL</i> COPY IT --
PUTS IT OUT THERE...

00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,200
THIS IS A BIG WORLD,
YOU KNOW?
YEAH, TOTALLY.

00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,070
THEY JUST WOULDN'T --
YOU KNOW, THEY JUST WOULDN'T --
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS.

00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:10,050
AND WHAT WOULD THEY
SELL IT FOR? SHE'S AT 50 BUCKS.

00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,070
WHAT WOULD THEY SELL IT?
IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE CHAIN.

00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:14,050
SO, IF THIS WAS GOING INTO
THE MASS MARKET,

00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:16,270
IT WOULD PROBABLY BE
$19.99.

00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:18,050
AT THE MOST.
YEAH, AT THE MOST.

00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:20,260
SO, RACHEL, YOU'RE ASKING
FOR $200,000.

00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,100
Nilsson: YEAH.

00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,060
YOU MADE $280,000
IN PROFITS.

00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,080
YEAH.

00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,000
HOW MUCH OF THAT
DO YOU STILL HAVE LEFT?

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,070
I HAVE ALMOST ALL OF THAT.

00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:30,030
SO YOU'RE ASKING FOR LESS
THAN YOU HAVE IN CASH ALREADY.

00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,010
I HAVE TWO --
I THINK I HAVE $215,000

00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,050
SITTING IN MY BANK ACCOUNT
RIGHT NOW.

00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:35,090
SO, WHAT IS THE CASH
GONNA DO FOR YOU TO MAR--

00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,110
YOU'VE ALREADY GOT
$215,000.

00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,050
I NEED <i>MORE</i> INVENTORY.
OKAY, BUT HANG ON.

00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:40,070
DO YOU WANT MORE INVENTORY
TO GO TO WHOLESALE?

00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,150
IS THAT WHAT --
NO. THIS IS MY POINT.

00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:45,040
ALL THE RETAILERS THAT WE HAVE
APPROVED TO PUT IN THEIR STORES,

00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,120
THEY ALL SOLD OUT
OF THEIR PRODUCT,

00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,120
AND THEY'RE COMING TO US,
AND WE HAVE TO SAY, "NO.

00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,110
WE CAN'T GIVE THAT TO YOU.
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH."

00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:52,070
SO THIS IS JUST
THE RETAILER SIDE

00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:54,030
THAT YOU WANT TO
CREATE THAT FOR.

00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,080
YEAH, YOU KNOW --

00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,100
BUT ARE YOU SURE -- ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO GO INTO RETAILERS?

00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,010
I'M <i>NOT</i> SURE.
I'M NOT SURE.

00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,090
SO, RACHEL,
WHAT'S THE DIRECTION?

00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:02,170
LIKE, I HEAR YOU TALKING ABOUT
"I'M AN EXCLUSIVE BRAND,"

00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:05,050
THEN I HEAR YOU TALKING ABOUT
MORE CASH FOR RETAIL.

00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,280
I'M SO GLAD
YOU MENTIONED THAT, SO...

00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,080
LIKE, WHAT --
WHAT'S THE STRATEGY?

00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,060
I REALLY WOULDN'T MIND
BRANCHING OUT.

00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,130
HERE'S THE DEAL.
I GO INTO --

00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:13,080
AND THAT MEANS
GOING INTO RETAIL?

00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,170
IF I GO INTO RETAIL,

00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:17,270
I DON'T WANT TO BE COMPETING
WITH MYSELF ONLINE.

00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:18,120
SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,060
SO WHAT WE'VE DONE
IS WE'VE CREATED

00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,280
A TOTALLY EXCLUSIVE LINE
FOR OUR RETAILERS.

00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,040
I WONDER
IF THAT'S GONNA WORK,

00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,020
BECAUSE THE DIFFERENCE
IN MARGINS TO YOU IS MATERIAL.

00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,110
THE RETAIL SALE
IS HALF THE PROFIT

00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:31,020
THAT YOU'RE MAKING
SELLING DIRECT.

00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,020
YEAH.
I'M JUST WONDERING WHY.

00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,040
I MEAN, IT'S WORKING
SO WELL FOR YOU.

00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,150
YEAH, WHY NOT KEEP
DRIVING IT ONLINE?

00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,270
WHY NOT KEEP ENGAGING?
LIKE, MAYBE WE WILL,
YOU KNOW?

00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:40,000
THAT'S KIND OF WHERE --

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,040
RACHEL,
HERE'S WHAT I SEE.

00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,040
I AGREE WITH THESE GUYS
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,020
YOU'RE KILLING IT.

00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,110
YOU MAY BE --
KILLING IT.

00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,090
YOU MAY BE
THE MOST PROFITABLE

00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:49,100
FROM A SALES-TO-NET-PROFIT
COMPANY

00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,280
THAT WE'VE HAD ON HERE
IN A LONG TIME.

00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,250
WOW.

00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,130
WHY SCREW IT UP?

00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:55,070
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S LIKE...

00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,020
I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU, MARK,
AND I AM --

00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,050
BUT YOU DIDN'T, THOUGH,
RIGHT?

00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:02,040
BECAUSE ON ONE HAND,
"TOTALLY. AWESOME. IT'S GREAT.

00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,110
I AGREE WITH YOU, MARK."

00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:05,060
BUT THEN,
ON THE OTHER HAND,

00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:07,070
IT'S, "OH, YEAH,
RETAIL STORES," RIGHT?

00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,080
"TOTALLY. AWESOME."

00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,110
HERE'S THE DEAL.
"WE WANT TO DO IT."

00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,120
HERE'S THE DEAL.
I WOULD GO NUTS.

00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,080
I WOULD GO NUTS.
HERE'S THE DEAL, MARK.

00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,020
I AM NOT SURE
IF I WANT TO GO THAT ROUTE.

00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,120
YOU'RE TRYING TO PLAY
A WHOLE NOTHER GAME,

00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,050
AND YOU DON'T KNOW
IF YOU SHOULD PLAY.

00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,100
YOU'VE SEEN
OTHER PEOPLE PLAY,

00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:21,040
"SO MAYBE I SHOULD PLAY BECAUSE
OTHER COMPANIES ARE BIGGER."

00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,080
YOU ARE GREAT
AT DESIGNING...
YEAH.

00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,070
...GETTING PEOPLE
TO TRUST YOU,

00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:28,030
AND SELLING THEM
A GREAT PRODUCT ONLINE

00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:30,040
AT HUGE MARGINS
THAT'S PROFITABLE TO YOU.

00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,070
I LOVE IT.
[ LAUGHS ]

00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,080
BUT THEN,
ALL OF A SUDDEN,

00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,030
WHEN SOMEONE ELSE
TALKS TO YOU, RIGHT...

00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,010
"WHOLESALE!"

00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:36,020
"'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW."

00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,000
HERE'S THE DEAL --

00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,030
"HERE'S THE DEAL,
RIGHT?"

00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:41,130
RACHEL, YOU'VE EXCEEDED
MY "HERE'S THE DEAL" QUOTA.

00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:44,090
YOU CAN'T MAKE UP YOUR MIND
ABOUT MAKING UP YOUR MIND.

00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:46,260
SO, FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.

00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,000
THANKS, MARK.

00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,100
THANK YOU.

00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:53,010
RACHEL, YOUR PRODUCT
IS NOT DEFENSIBLE.

00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,060
YEAH.
YOUR BRAND <i>IS.</i>

00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,100
ABSOLUTELY.

00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,120
MY CHALLENGE IS,
WHAT DO <i>YOU</i> WANT TO DO?

00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:01,020
I WANT TO MAKE MONEY.
I WANT TO BE <i>MRS.</i> WONDERFUL.

00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,010
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,020
I WANT TO MAKE --

00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,260
YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE
MRS. WONDERFUL.

00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,260
MAYBE I TOOK IT TOO FAR.

00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,280
OH, I LOVE THAT.

00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,160
RACHEL,
YOU'RE AUTHENTIC.

00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,290
YOU'RE SELLING SOMETHING
THAT YOU WOULD USE.

00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:10,140
IT'S A VERY AUTHENTIC --

00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,060
AND THAT'S WHAT
GREAT BRANDS ARE.

00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,090
HEY, ROBERT, ARE YOU GONNA
MAKE HER AN OFFER?

00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:15,090
YEAH,
I'M GONNA MAKE AN OFFER.

00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:18,040
ALL RIGHT. I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $200,000 FOR 20%.

00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,190
THANK YOU, ROBERT.
OKAY.

00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,080
YOU KNOW, RACHEL,
I'VE GOT MULTIPLE COMPANIES NOW

00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,070
INVOLVED WITH YOUNG FAMILIES,
AROUND WEDDINGS, ENGAGEMENTS --

00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:29,050
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF USERS.

00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:31,140
IT'S CALLED THE
SOMETHING WONDERFUL PLATFORM.

00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:34,080
WE PUSH CUSTOMERS
AT A ZERO COST BASE
TO EACH OTHER.

00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,050
I THINK YOU COULD
FIT NICELY IN IT

00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:39,050
BECAUSE SO MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE
HAVE CHILDREN.

00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:42,030
SO I LIKE IT
FOR MY PORTFOLIO.

00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:44,230
BUT I DON'T LIKE
THE RETAIL BUSINESS VERY MUCH.

00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,070
OKAY. COOL.

00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:47,060
AND SO I HAVE
A PLATFORM FOR YOU,

00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,090

I THINK YOU'RE GONNA GET TO
$1 MILLION IN SALES.

00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:03,100
YEAH, WE SHOULD GET TO
$1 MILLION FOR SURE BY DECEMBER.

00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,120
I DON'T DOUBT THAT AT ALL.

SPEAKING OF
PORTFOLIO COMPANIES,

00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:08,080
WE HAVE A COMPANY
CALLED TIPSY ELVES.

00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,110
GREAT GUYS. THEY WERE DOING
$600,000 A YEAR.

00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:12,130
I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW MANY CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD

00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:15,220
OVER THREE YEARS ABOUT GOING
THIS WAY, ABOUT GOING THAT WAY.

00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,090
YEAH.

00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:18,080
THREE YEARS LATER,

WE'RE AN ONLINE COMPANY...

00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:22,080
...THAT'LL DO OVER $15 MILLION
THIS YEAR.

00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,020
WE'VE EXPANDED
THE PRODUCT LINE

00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,150
BUT ALWAYS STAY TRUE
TO THE CORE.

00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:28,050
THAT'S INTERESTING.
GOING DOWN KEVIN'S ROUTE,
YOU'RE GONNA BE ELIMINATED.

00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:29,080
BUT THE SOMETHING WONDERFUL

00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,050
YEAH.

00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:59,110
HERE'S THE DEAL --
LIKE, ROBERT, TIPSY ELVES,

00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:02,020
I'VE FOLLOWED THAT,
AND I'VE SEEN THE GROWTH,

00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,000
AND I LOVE
THAT THEY ARE ONLINE.

00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,336
IT SEEMS SIMPLE.

00:40:04,336 --> 00:40:05,170
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,

00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:09,030
I KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE GONNA
COME IN AND WANT TO COPY.

00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,080
I'D RATHER COPY MYSELF
AND MAKE CLOTHES --

00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,100
THEY'RE GONNA CRANK IT OUT
NO MATTER WHAT,

00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,110
SO EITHER
WE'RE GONNA MAKE MONEY

00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,070
OFF THEM CRANKING IT OUT
OR NOT.

00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,080
Herjavec:
NO, THAT'S SO NOT TRUE.

00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,120
I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT,

00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,080
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO CONTROL
YOUR INVENTORY COSTS.

00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:21,030
ANYBODY CAN ALWAYS
KNOCK OFF ANYTHING.

00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:23,070
RIGHT.
YOU DON'T HAVE SOMETHING
PROPRIETARY.

00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:25,130
WHEN YOU CREATE THE BRAND
THAT YOU CAN

00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:28,070
AND YOU GET TO $20 MILLION
AND $50 MILLION,

00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:30,030
YOU CAN JUST
LICENSE YOUR NAME.

00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,080
YOU'RE NOT THERE TODAY.

00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,000
ROBERT, THEY'RE NOT PUTTING --
IT DOESN'T WORK.

00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,030
THEY'RE NOT PUTTING
THE NAME ON --

00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,050
YOU'RE NOT PUTTING
RAGS TO RACHES ON IT.

00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:36,110
BUT WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA LICENSE?

00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:38,020
A JUMPER
WITH AN ELASTIC BAND?

00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,090
IF SOMEBODY WANTED
TO LICENSE THAT TODAY --

00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:40,110
YEAH,
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT --

00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:42,030
THE BIG BOYS AND GIRLS
ARE DOING THAT NOW.

00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:44,040
WILL SHE MAKE MONEY
OFF OF THAT?

00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:48,040
LISTEN, I'VE DONE THIS WITH
30 DIFFERENT APPAREL COMPANIES.

00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,140
RACHEL,
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:53,030
THEY'RE TALKING
WITH LIMITED UNDERSTANDING

00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,080
BECAUSE THEY DID
ONE OR TWO.

00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,070
LORI, ARE WE GONNA
HEAR FROM YOU OR NOT?

00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,090
WHILE WE'RE STILL YOUNG?

00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:00,060
LORI,
YOU DON'T HAVE AN OFFER?

00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,130
I WOULD OFFER YOU SOMETHING
THAT'S JUST THE SAME AS DAYMOND,

00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:04,180
BUT DAYMOND'S GREAT
AT DOING THAT.

00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:07,100
THAT'S WHY I'M NOT
GOING TO MAKE YOU AN OFFER.

00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,000
BUT I WISH YOU GOOD LUCK.

00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,030
THANK YOU, LORI.

00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:13,070
OKAY. YOU GOT
THREE SHARKS INTERESTED.

00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,120
THE OFFERS ARE IDENTICAL.

00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,150
YOU HAVE TO
MAKE A DECISION.

00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:22,260
ROBERT, ARE YOU WILLING TO
GO DOWN TO 15% FOR $200,000?

00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:29,120
DO WE HAVE A DEAL
IF I DO?

00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:32,140
OR ARE YOU GONNA CONTINUE
NEGOTIATING?

00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:35,250
YOUR WHOLE BUSINESS IS WORTH
THE DIFFERENCE OF 5%?

00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:36,100
NO.

00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,100
THAT'S WHAT
THE PARTNER IS WORTH?

00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,170
DOES IT REALLY MAKE
THAT BIG A DIFFERENCE, 5%?

00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:43,070
MAYBE NOT, BUT --
RACHEL,
HERE'S MY QUESTION.

00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:46,060
IF I GO DOWN TO 15%,
DO WE HAVE A DEAL?

00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:49,290
DO YOU WANT A PARTNER
WHO IS NOT THAT VESTED IN IT?

00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:59,000
ROBERT, WE HAVE A DEAL.

00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,040
DONE.

00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,280
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,290
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU!

00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,280
GOOD JOB!

00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,020
THANK YOU, GUYS.

00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,240
CONGRATULATIONS.

00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:10,170
[ SQUEALS ]

00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:14,170
I JUST CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE
THAT I STARTED TOTALLY BROKE,

00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:17,160
SELLING MY KIDS' HAND-ME-DOWNS,
AND A LITTLE OVER A YEAR,

00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,090
AND I'M HERE AS A MOM
WITH THREE YOUNG BOYS,

00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:23,100
AND I MADE THIS WORK,
AND I MADE MY COMPANY A SUCCESS,

00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:26,100
AND I'M SO PROUD OF MYSELF
AND MY FAMILY.
