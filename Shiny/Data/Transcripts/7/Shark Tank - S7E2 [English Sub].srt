00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,360
BUT WHAT THE HACKERS DON'T KNOW
IS WE ARE IMPLEMENTING

00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,164
LEADING SECURITY MEASURES
TO KEEP PEOPLE'S SECURITY --

00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,733
AND WHERE DO YOU GET
THOSE SECURITY MEASURES FROM?

00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:21,401
WE HAVE GUYS

00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:24,070
THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING IN
THIS INDUSTRY FOR A LONG TIME.

00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,305
OUR LEAD DEVELOPER --

00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,307
O'Leary:
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE GREAT
THINGS ABOUT "SHARK TANK"

00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,043
IS THAT IN EVERY SECTOR,
THERE'S AN EXPERT.

00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:33,980
NOW, IN THIS CASE,
MR. HERJAVEC MAKES A LIVING

00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,249
SELLING SECURITY SYSTEMS
TO REALLY BIG COMPANIES.

00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:37,550
AND I HAVE AN APP
CALLED CYBER DUST,

00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,253
WHERE I'VE HAD TO PAY ATTENTION
TO SECURITY CONTINUOUSLY.

00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:42,155
SO BE CAREFUL
WHEN YOU ANSWER THIS,

00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,190
'CAUSE I THINK
YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET FRIED.

00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,292
GIVE THEM
A CHANCE!

00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:47,360
Doug:
YOU KNOW, MARK,

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,195
I'M SURE THAT WHEN YOU STARTED
WITH CYBER DUST,

00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:50,463
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
A SECURITY BACKGROUND.

00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,231
Herjavec: YEAH, BUT IT DOESN'T
WORK THAT WAY, GUYS.

00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,366
YOU'RE COMING
TO THE TAIL END OF AN INDUSTRY

00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,134
THAT'S BEEN AROUND
FOR A LONG TIME.

00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,936
HOW LONG
HAVE PASSWORDS BEEN AROUND?

00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,372
LIKE, THIS ISN'T
A FLIGHTY SUBJECT.

00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:02,342
I'M PREPARING THE BUTTER
TO SAUTé YOU IN IT.

00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,510
OH, STOP IT! YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU GUYS CAME IN HERE.

00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,346
YOU CARED ENOUGH ABOUT IT
TO DRESS UP FOR THE MOMENT.

00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,247
GARLIC OR NO GARLIC,
LORI?

00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,183
LISTEN, EVERYBODY'S
BITING YOUR HEADS OFF.

00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,317
TELL US HOW IT WORKS.

00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:14,420
THE ENCRYPTED DATA,
WHICH IS USING AES256,

00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:18,358
THOUSANDS OF ROUNDS
OF PBKDF2 AND BCRYPT --

00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,593
THAT'S TYPICAL.
EVERYBODY DOES THAT.

00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,229
NOT EVERYBODY
DOES THAT, AND --

00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,064
AES256 IS NOT UNUSUAL.

00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:27,166
AES256 IS
A LEADING STANDARD.

00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,068
BUT IT'S NOT UNIQUE TO YOU.
IT'S OPEN-SOURCE.

00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:30,203
IT'S NOT EXCLUSIVE
TO YOU.

00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,305
SO, KEEP GOING.
I DOWNLOAD THE APP. TELL ME --

00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:34,040
SO YOU SAVE
YOUR PASSWORDS.
OKAY.

00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,009
IT'S ENCRYPTED.
YOU LOG IN WITH OUR APP.

00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,178
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
I GO TO A WEBSITE.

00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:40,947
EVERYTHING IS AUTOMATIC.

00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:42,148
THE NEXT TIME
YOU GO TO A WEBSITE,

00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:44,250
IT AUTOMATICALLY FILLS
YOUR USERNAME AND PASSWORD,

00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,052
AUTOMATICALLY
LOGS YOU IN.

00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,920
OKAY.

00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,790
Greiner: LET ME COME FROM
THE FEMALE POINT OF VIEW, OKAY?

00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,391
[ LAUGHS ]

00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,126
THERE'S A FEMALE POINT OF VIEW
TO TECHNOLOGY?

00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:54,160
YOU DON'T USE PASSWORDS?

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,294
THERE IS NO FEMALE POINT
OF VIEW.

00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:56,429
NO, OF COURSE THERE IS!
OH, MY GOD!

00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:59,132
IT'S A TECHNOLOGY
QUESTION.
NO! YOU GUYS!

00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:01,401
FROM BEING IN TV SALES
FOR 18 YEARS,

00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,437
I KNOW THAT WOMEN CONSUMERS
REACT DIFFERENTLY

00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:07,306
TO CERTAIN THINGS
THAN MALE CONSUMERS DO.

00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:11,377
SO IF YOU'RE NOT A TECHIE WOMAN,
THIS MIGHT BE APPEALING TO YOU.

00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:16,249
MAYBE YOU GUYS THINK
IS SUBPAR OR NOTHING NEW,

00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:19,852
BUT FOR A WOMAN,
IT WOULD BE EASY TO ACCESS.

00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:20,453
LORI, THIS IS CRAZY.

00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:22,121
SO I WANT TO HEAR
WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY ABOUT IT

00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,222
WITHOUT THEM
GETTING SKEWERED.

00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,191
I'M SO HAPPY WITH WHAT
LORI JUST SAID, BECAUSE SHE --

00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:26,459
I BET YOU ARE,
'CAUSE WE'RE CRUSHING YOU,

00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,694
AND SHE'S TRYING TO GIVE YOU
A LIFELINE.

00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:29,195
YEAH, BUT --

00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:31,397
DOUG, SECURITY IS
A NON-GENDER ISSUE.

00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:32,865
SECURITY IS
FOR <i>EVERYBODY.</i>
NO, NO.

00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:35,668
THAT'S NOT THE POINT
THAT I'M TRYING TO MAKE.
NO, HAVING AN APP
THAT'S USER-FRIENDLY

00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:38,938
WELL, WHAT'S THE POINT
YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE?
...MAKES A WOMAN
FEEL COMFORTABLE.

00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:39,939
LET US ADDRESS IT.

00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,140
LET ME ADDRESS
WHAT LORI SAID.

00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,442
HOW MUCH DO YOU CHARGE
FOR THE SERVICE?

00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,110
NO, NO. LET HIM FINISH, THOUGH,
ROBERT, PLEASE.

00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,078
LET HIM FINISH. BECAUSE, BARB,
AREN'T YOU INTERESTED?

00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:47,380
I'M VERY INTERESTED,
AND I AGREE WITH HER

00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,182
THAT WE HAVE
A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON IT,

00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:50,550
AND I'M ANXIOUS
TO HEAR YOUR ANSWER

00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,252
IF THE GENTLEMEN WOULD NOT BE
SO RUDE.
AND WE'RE NOT
AS TECHNOLOGICAL.

00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,655
Herjavec:
WHAT DO YOU CHARGE FOR IT?

00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:00,760
IT'S $4.99 A MONTH
OR $49.99 A YEAR.

00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:04,297
Corcoran: ONLY ABOUT A WEEK AGO,
I COULDN'T REMEMBER A PASSWORD.

00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,132
IT WAS DRIVING ME NUTS,
ALL RIGHT?

00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:09,469
TOOK ALL OF MY PASSWORDS
AND DUMPED IT INTO ONE APP,

00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,338
AND ALL I NOW HAVE
IS <i>ONE</i> PASSWORD,

00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:15,975
SO IT'S AN AGGREGATE
OF ALL OF MY PASSWORDS.

00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,376
IS THIS
WHAT THIS SITE DOES?

00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:20,012
AND IF SO, AREN'T THERE
A LOT OF THEM OUT THERE?

00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,047
YES,
AND IT ALLOWS --

00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:23,049
SO THERE'S
LOTS OF COMPETITION, RIGHT?

00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:26,052
WE ARE THE FIRST SOLUTION
BUILT SPECIFICALLY

00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:27,253
FOR THE EVERYDAY,
NONTECHNICAL USER.

00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:29,055
Herjavec:
NO, NO. BUT HANG ON, NOW.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:31,691
YOU'RE TELLING ME
WHO IT'S DESIGNED FOR.

00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:32,225
GOT IT.

00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:34,393
BUT TELL ME
WHAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT IT.

00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:37,530
JUST GIVE ME THAT SECRET SAUCE.
GIVE ME SOMETHING.

00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:41,200
OUR PROPRIETARY BANNER
THAT INTERACTS WITH THE USER

00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,268
AS THEY BROWSE
THE INTERNET.

00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:43,302
BUT YEAH,
THAT'S NOT NEW, RIGHT?

00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,904
BUT YOU'RE JUST SAYING
IT'S SIMPLER.

00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:46,239
YES. AND IT --

00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:47,974
TELL ME
WHAT YOUR SALES ARE.

00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:49,108
OKAY.

00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:52,011
OUR SALES ARE $55,000 SINCE
THE BEGINNING OF LAST MONTH.

00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,079
THAT'S NOT BAD.
THAT'S GOOD.

00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:54,380
SO YOU'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS
A MONTH?

00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,082
WHEN WE WERE
FINISHING DEVELOPMENT

00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:57,383
AT THE END OF LAST YEAR,

00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:00,353
WE WERE APPROACHED
BY A LARGE SECURITY COMPANY,

00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,188
WENT THROUGH
ALL OF OUR SOFTWARE,

00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,190
MADE SURE THAT IT WAS
UP TO THEIR STANDARDS,

00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,092
AND THEY WANTED
TO LICENSE IT FROM US.

00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:08,194
SO THE $55,000
IS A ROYALTY FROM THEM.

00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,129
YES.
WHICH ONE?

00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:11,964
I CAN'T SHARE
THAT INFORMATION.

00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,967
WE'RE UNDER
NONDISCLOSURE.

00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:20,106
HOW MUCH DO THEY PAY YOU
PER USER?

00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:21,674
WE CAN'T SAY EXACTLY
HOW MUCH THEY PAY US PER USER.

00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:23,543
THAT'S PART OF
THEIR NONDISCLOSURE.
YOU WANT AN INVESTMENT.

00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,245

THAT YOU'RE GIVING US.

00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,080
I'M GONNA TURN IT AROUND
FOR A SECOND

I'M GONNA SELL YOU A PRODUCT.

THIS IS
THE BEST PRODUCT EVER --

00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,592
BECAUSE I LICENSED IT
TO A COMPANY

00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:42,361
I CAN'T TELL YOU ABOUT,
BUT THEY'RE A GREAT COMPANY.

00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:45,331
I CAN'T TELL YOU THEIR NAME,
I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT THEY DO,

00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:14,986
TO REDUCE THE USE
OF DISPOSABLE TABLEWARE.

00:34:22,294 --> 00:34:24,129
HI. I'M CHELSEA.

00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:24,729
AND I'M LEIGH ANN.

00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:28,433
WE'RE FROM NEW YORK CITY,
AND WE'RE SEEKING $150,000

00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:31,102
FOR 10% OF OUR COMPANY,
LOLIWARE.

00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:33,204
LOLIWARE IS
A NEW CATEGORY

00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:36,074
OF SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS
THAT YOU CAN EAT.

00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:40,211
THAT'S RIGHT --
I JUST ATE MY CUP.
THAT'S FUNNY.

00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:43,214
WE CALL THIS NEW CATEGORY
BIODEGREDIBLE.

00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:46,818
IT'S BOTH BIODEGRADABLE
AND EDIBLE.

00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:50,221
IT'S A NEW AND EXCITING
EATING AND DRINKING EXPERIENCE

00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:52,524
THAT OFFERS
FUN FLAVOR COMBINATIONS

00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:54,492
FOR BOTH BEVERAGES
AND DESSERTS.

00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:56,595
IMAGINE DRINKING
YOUR COLD-BREW COFFEE

00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,463
IN OUR MADAGASCAR
VANILLA CUP

00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:01,299
OR EVEN A MARGARITA
IN A CITRUS CUP.

00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:03,335
LOLIWARE IS
A DELICIOUS ALTERNATIVE

00:35:03,335 --> 00:35:06,271
TO DISPOSABLE CUPS
DESTINED FOR THE LANDFILL.

00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:08,540
OUR CUPS GO FROM CUP TO SOIL
IN 60 DAYS.

00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:12,277
THEY'RE 100% VEGAN,
GLUTEN-FREE,

00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:13,545
AND MADE
WITH ORGANIC INGREDIENTS.

00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:15,714
BUT THE CUP
IS JUST THE BEGINNING.

00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:19,150
WITH LOLIWARE, WE'RE CREATING
A PLASTIC-FREE REVOLUTION

00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,318
AND GIVING PEOPLE
A REASON

00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:22,387
TO GET EXCITED
ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY.

00:35:22,387 --> 00:35:24,489
SHARKS, WE INVITE YOU
TO EAT YOUR CUP

00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:28,360
AND TO CREATE A BIODEGREDIBLE
WORLD WITH LOLIWARE.

00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,362
NOW, WHO'S READY TO TRY
THE CUP OF THE FUTURE?

00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:31,896
Herjavec:
GOT TO TRY IT.

00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:32,597
OKAY.

00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:34,132
LORI, WHAT FLAVOR
DO YOU WANT?

00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:34,766
OH, WOW.

00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:37,602
ROBERT, WE MADE YOU
A SPECIAL MATCHA GREEN TEA FLOAT

00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:40,372
WITH CHAMPAGNE
AND GOJI BERRY GARNISH.
THANK YOU.

00:35:40,372 --> 00:35:43,241
LORI, WE MADE YOU
A BEAUTIFUL LAVENDER HONEY.

00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:44,776
MR. WONDERFUL,
WE MADE YOU

00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:47,345
A BEAUTIFUL
TART CHERRY CUP.
IT UPSETS ME EVERY TIME
YOU SAY "MR. WONDERFUL."

00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:48,380
THIS ONE RIGHT HERE?
IT UPSETS ME.

00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,347
YES.
THANK YOU.

00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:50,482
I SHOULD
PROBABLY EAT BARBARA'S,

00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:51,616
'CAUSE I EAT HER ALIVE
EVERY DAY.

00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:53,084
BARBARA, WE HAD TO MAKE YOU
A MADAGASCAR VANILLA CUP

00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,587
TO PUT AN EDIBLE GOLD RIM
ON IT.
OH, THAT'S GOOD,
WHATEVER'S IN HERE.

00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:57,422
Greiner:
YOUR CUP IS DELICIOUS.

00:35:57,422 --> 00:35:59,457
WE'RE GLAD YOU LIKE IT.

00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,726
THIS CUP
IS REALLY DELICIOUS.

00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:05,030
I MEAN, I COULD SEE SOMEBODY
EATING YOUR CUP AS A DESSERT.

00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,197
WHAT IS IT MADE OF?

00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:07,532
IT'S A VEGETABLE GELATIN,

00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:09,501
SO IT'S AN ALL-VEGAN VERSION
OF GELATIN.

00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:11,236
YEAH.
IT'S 100% GLUTEN-FREE.

00:36:11,236 --> 00:36:13,371
IT TASTES A LITTLE BIT
LIKE LICORICE, LIKE A --

00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:14,606
YAHOO! FOOD
WROTE ABOUT US,

00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:17,475
AND THEY THOUGHT THE CUP
WAS LIKE AN ADULT FRUIT ROLL-UP.

00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:20,445
ALL OF OUR FLAVORS AND COLORS
COME FROM FRUITS AND VEGETABLES.

00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:22,247
WHO IS YOUR CONSUMER
SO FAR?

00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:24,449
SO, WE LAUNCHED SALES
THREE MONTHS AGO,

00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:26,451
AND WE HAVE $110,000
IN SALES,

00:36:26,451 --> 00:36:28,353
AND WE'RE PARTNERING
WITH A $30 MILLION

00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:29,487
EVENT-PLANNING COMPANY
IN NEW YORK CITY

00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:31,423
CALLED SAVE THE DATE,
WHO HAS JUST SIGNED

00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:33,858
A $1.3 MILLION
LETTER OF INTENT

00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:37,295
TO SELL LOLIWARE TO ALL OF
THEIR EVENTS IN NEW YORK CITY.

00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:38,430
WE ALSO ARE SIGNED

00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,498
WITH ONE OF THE LARGEST
FOOD-DISTRIBUTION COMPANIES.

00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:42,367
Corcoran:
THEY JUST CALLED YOU UP
AND SAID, "WE LOVE YOU.

00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,601
WE HEARD ABOUT YOU.
WE'RE COMING"?

00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:44,636
THEY SAW US
AT A TRADE SHOW.

00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:46,371
WE WERE AT CATERSOURCE
IN LAS VEGAS.

00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:49,174
I SEE.
IN ONE DAY,
WE SOLD 3,500 CUPS.

00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:50,175
WOW.

00:36:50,175 --> 00:36:51,342
HOW DID YOU COME UP
WITH THIS IDEA?

00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:52,644
YEAH,
SO, LEIGH ANN AND I MET

00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:55,380
AT ONE OF THE TOP DESIGN SCHOOLS
IN NEW YORK CITY,

00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,748
CALLED PARSONS SCHOOL
OF DESIGN.

00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:59,551
MM-HMM.
AND WE GRADUATED
AT THE TOP OF OUR CLASS.

00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:02,554
SO, ACTUALLY, THIS PRODUCT
STARTED AS A COMPETITION.

00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,289
WE THOUGHT,
"WOULDN'T IT BE COOL

00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:05,590
IF WE THOUGHT OF JELLO
AS A MATERIAL

00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,759
THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY CREATE
SOMETHING STRUCTURAL FROM?"

00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:10,361
WE THOUGHT, "I WONDER
IF WE COULD REPLACE PLASTIC CUPS

00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:11,663
BY MAKING EDIBLE CUPS."

00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:13,698
WE WENT TO THE COMPETITION.
EVERYONE LOVED IT.

00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:16,201
THEY HAD TO CREATE
A NEW CATEGORY FOR US.

00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:18,603
AND SOMETHING INCREDIBLE
HAPPENED.

00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:22,173
LOLIWARE EXPLODED
ON THE INTERNET,
AND IT WENT VIRAL.

00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:23,341
THE NEXT WEEK,

00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:26,144
I GOT AN ORDER FOR 60,000 CUPS
FROM PERNOD RICARD.

00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,579
60,000 CUPS?
60,000.

00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:29,514
Herjavec: AND, CHELSEA,
WHAT DO YOU SELL IT FOR,

00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:30,648
AND WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE?

00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:33,718
SO, IT COSTS US 97 CENTS
TO MAKE EACH CUP RIGHT NOW,

00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:37,355
AND WE'RE SELLING IT TO
FOOD SERVICE FOR $1.50 PER CUP,

00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:40,325
AND WE'RE LOOKING
TO TAKE THOSE COSTS DOWN

00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:41,626
DRAMATICALLY
OVER THE NEXT YEAR.

00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:44,229
WE ANTICIPATE
THAT IT'LL GO DOWN TO 50 CENTS.

00:37:44,229 --> 00:37:45,263
YOU MUST HAVE
RAISED MONEY,

00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,431
BECAUSE YOU HAD TO PAY
FOR INVENTORY,

00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:47,599
YOU HAD TO FIGURE OUT
THE MACHINE.

00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,201
YEAH, AFTER WE REALIZED THIS IS
SOMETHING WE WANT TO TAKE

00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:52,437
FROM PROTOTYPE TO BUSINESS,

00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:55,406
WE PUT IN OUR OWN MONEY --
ABOUT $10,000 --

00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:57,776
THEN WE DID
A FRIENDS AND FAMILY $100,000,

00:37:57,776 --> 00:38:01,312
AND CURRENTLY,
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF A $1 MILLION RAISE.

00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:03,314
WE'RE 30% THROUGH.

00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:05,517
WE HAVE ANOTHER $100,000
COMMITTED.

00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:07,352
CHELSEA, LOOK,
I-I LOVE IT.

00:38:07,352 --> 00:38:08,787
I THINK
YOU NEED MORE MONEY.

00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:12,657
I'M REALLY NOT INTERESTED IN
PUTTING UP THE $150,000 FOR 10%.

00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:15,326
YOU HAVE AN OUTSTANDING AMOUNT
OF $600,000.

00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:17,562
UM...
I WANT TO PARTICIPATE.

00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:20,365
I MEAN, I'D BE INTERESTED
FOR GETTING MORE EQUITY.

00:38:20,365 --> 00:38:21,466
SURE. WHAT'S --

00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:23,134
IF WE PUT UP
THE ENTIRE $600,000.

00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:26,271
YEAH.

00:38:26,271 --> 00:38:27,438
BUT I DON'T WANT TO PUT IT UP
ON MY OWN.

00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:28,773
I MEAN, I'M HAPPY TO GO IN
WITH ANYBODY ELSE.

00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:31,342
WE WOULD LOVE TO CLOSE OUT
THE ROUND WITH THE SHARKS.

00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:33,244
HOW MUCH IS LEFT
IN THE ROUND?

00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:34,245
$600,000.

00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:36,147
WE COULD DO 25%.

Cuban: DONE.

00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:39,651

WHO'S COMING IN?

00:38:42,387 --> 00:38:45,256
I'M IN.
I WANT A PIECE OF THAT.

00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:46,624
CAN WE HEAR OTHER DEALS?

WHO GETS IN.

00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:40,578
I DID A GREAT INVESTMENT
WITH MARK FOR LOLLACUP.

00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:42,280
I DON'T THINK WE NEED

WELL, WE'D LOVE TO HEAR
WHAT BARBARA HAS TO SAY.
NO, I WOULD LIKE
TO SAY SOMETHING.

00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:50,655
I PREFER MARK AS A PARTNER
BECAUSE HE HAS GOT

00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:53,892
THREE TIMES AS MUCH MONEY THAN
ALL THE OTHER LITTLE MEN HERE.

00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:55,727

THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS,
I'D BE HAPPY

00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:10,341
TO TAKE MY MOST FAVORITE PARTNER

OR EVEN LORI, OKAY?

00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,678
BUT YOU'D BE
OUT OF YOUR MIND

00:40:13,678 --> 00:40:16,147
TO DO A DEAL
WITHOUT ME INVOLVED.

00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:17,181
YOU'D REALLY BE CRAZY.

00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:17,715
WHY IS THAT?

00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:19,617
I AM THE BEST PARTNER

OKAY.

00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:48,813
Greiner: I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I'M THINKING.
OKAY.

00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:52,583
I LOVE YOUR MISSION ABOUT CARING
ABOUT WASTE AND LANDFILLS,

00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:55,353
BUT I THINK
IT'S REALLY A PARTY THING.

00:40:55,353 --> 00:40:58,556
COME IN WITH US, AND WE'LL GET
THREE SHARKS FOR $600K.

00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:01,292
THEN IT'S THREE VERSUS TWO.
I LIKE IT.

00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,194
NO,
I DON'T FEEL LIKE THAT.

00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:06,064
AS MUCH AS I LOVE YOU...

00:41:06,064 --> 00:41:07,465
I'M GONNA GO OUT.

00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,767
Both:
WE RESPECT YOUR DECISION.

00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:12,170
MARK, ARE YOU THROWING ME
TO THE CURB WITH BARBARA?

00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:14,539
HONESTLY,
I CAN WORK WITH EITHER/OR.

00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:15,573
I KNOW
IT'S THE SHARK TANK,

00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:17,408
BUT I'M NOT GONNA THROW MARK
TO THE CURB.

00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:22,347
THE ORIGINAL DEAL WAS MARK AND I
FOR $600,000 FOR 25%.

00:41:22,347 --> 00:41:23,681
THAT'S THE OFFER
WE MADE YOU.
OKAY.

00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:25,450
I DON'T WANT TO GO IN
WITH KEVIN OR BARBARA.

00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:26,718
THAT WAS
THE ORIGINAL OFFER.
OKAY.

00:41:26,718 --> 00:41:28,686
O'Leary:

00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:45,703

00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:49,173

FOR ALL OF THE OFFERS,

00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,541

00:41:55,313 --> 00:41:56,848

00:42:04,422 --> 00:42:05,590
TOUGH.

00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:09,694
OH, MY GOSH. I CAN'T BELIEVE
WHAT JUST HAPPENED.

00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:12,397
Briganti:
THIS IS A REALLY SURREAL MOMENT
FOR LEIGH ANN AND I.

00:42:12,397 --> 00:42:14,799
WE WENT IN
ASKING FOR $150,000 FOR 10%,

00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:16,768
AND WE WERE EXPECTING TO HAVE TO
OFFER A LOT MORE EQUITY

00:42:16,768 --> 00:42:19,303
FOR THAT AMOUNT,
'CAUSE WE'RE A VERY NEW COMPANY.

00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:20,605
AND THE FACT
THAT WE'RE WALKING OUT

00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:24,142
WITH OUR WHOLE ROUND FINISHED
BY OUR TOP TWO SHARKS,

00:42:24,142 --> 00:42:25,176
IT'S REALLY SURREAL.

00:42:25,176 --> 00:42:26,411
WE COULDN'T BE
MORE EXCITED.
