00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,090
Narrator:
This is the Shark Tank,

00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,020
where entrepreneurs
seek an investment

00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,020
to start, grow, or save
their business.

00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,050
The product has
so much potential.

00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,060
Narrator: If the sharks
hear a great idea...

00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,080
It's deal time.

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,233
Yes!

00:00:14,233 --> 00:00:15,240
Narrator: ...they'll invest
their own money...

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,190
Oh, my God!

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,240
Narrator: ...and fight
each other for a deal.

00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,100
The problem is --
Wait. I don't need your problem
-- bup, bup, bup, bup.

00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,220
Stick to your basketball.

00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,270
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,080
Narrator: The entrepreneurs
must get the full amount

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,090
they're asking for...

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,220
I'm a hustler.

00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,070
Narrator: ...or they'll walk
away with nothing.

00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,100
Who cares?

00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,050
Well, <i>you</i> care.

00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,100
Barbara's very confused.

00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,150
I just can't believe
why the other sharks

00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,260
aren't all over this.

00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,220
Because you have nothing!
Nothing!

00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,090
Shut up, Kevin.

00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,020
Narrator:
Who are the sharks?

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,040
They're self-made
business experts worth billions.

00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,290
Kevin O'Leary is
a shrewd venture capitalist

00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,250
who made his fortune

selling a children's
educational company

00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,030
for over $4 billion.

00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,240
Barbara Corcoran went from
waiting tables in Manhattan

00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,250

the world's preeminent

♪♪

00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,200
Hi, sharks, it's great
to meet you guys today.

00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,070
My name is Katherine Krug,

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,050
and I'm the creator
of BetterBack.

00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:05,080
Today I'm seeking
a $750,000 investment

00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,200
for a 7.5% equity stake
in my company.

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,190
Wow.

00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:13,090
So, sharks, check your posture
right now.

00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,110
I'm especially looking
at you, Cuban.

00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,160
Yeah, what can I say?
-[ Chuckles ]

00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,150
It turns out that we sit for
over 9 hours every single day,

00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,190
and because of the way
we're doing it,

00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,140
hunched and rounded towards
our work and our technology,

00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,130
it means 8 out of
every 10 people you know

00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:32,040
will have back pain
in their lives.

00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,180
My back pain started
over three years ago,

00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,040
and I have spent so much time
and money

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,170
trying dozens of products
and therapies,

00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:42,100
and I couldn't find anything
that just worked.

00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,290
So I made BetterBack.

00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,240
BetterBack allows you

00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,290
to effortlessly sit
in perfect posture,

00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:53,090
easing back pain and retraining
your body's default posture,

00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,040
so when you stand or sit
without BetterBack,

00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,060
your posture is greatly
improved.

00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,260
It's lightweight and portable,

00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,130
so you can throw it in your bag

00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,160
and make every
single chair ergonomic.

00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,050
BetterBack is just the start.

00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,250
I'm on a mission to disrupt
the orthopedic aisle

00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,240
and help people not just have
better backs,

00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,130
but to live better.

00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,050
So, sharks, who's got my back?

00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,010
I want to try it on.
-Yes.

00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,210
Great.
I've got samples for you guys.

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,120
Start with you guys here.
-This is Lori's?

00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,050
-Yes. Thank you so much.
-And we do what he did?

00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,160
O'Leary: How do --

00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,270
Greiner: You put it over
your knees and then around --

00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,170
and around your back?

00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,210
That's exactly right.
I'll walk you guys through it.

00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,270
So, you guys will start

00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:35,040
by placing two feet
flat on the floor,

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,270
which is just great
ergonomics.

00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,180
Next, you'll notice
the up arrow,

00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,050
so that's the side
that goes up.

00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,080
So, yeah, wrap the back pad
around your back...

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,190
Okay.

00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,070
...and you'll wrap the kneepads
around your knees.

00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,280
After you put it on
the first time,

00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,240
it gets much easier and faster
to put it on.

00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,050
The best thing to do is,

00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,260
once the kneepads
are over your knee,

00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,040
if it's loose enough,
you'll want to lean forward

00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,250
and pull on the adjustable
straps while you sit up,

00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,040
which should put you in
a really supportive position.

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,250
Katherine, it was
pretty intimidating,

00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,160
putting it on or seeing it.

00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,090
It seemed like it was
complicated -- what goes where?

00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,060
Once it's on,
I have to tell you,

00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,030
it's like
you can totally relax.

00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,120
Katherine: Yay!

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,110
The ball of your back
is in perfect position.

00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,250
I love it!

00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,200
Who's this gentleman
sitting here?

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,020
He is my hunky model --
my fiancé!

00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,030
-Ah.
-[ Chuckles ]

00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,070
Congratulations.

00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,020
-So, tell us how it started.
-Yeah.

00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,000
So I was building
my last start up,

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,210
and I was working
the 14-hours-a day,

00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,070
6-days-a-week grind,

00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,220
and just the act of
rounding towards my laptop

00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,240
for so many hours a day set off
terrible sciatica pain,

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,210
and I tried dozens
of products

00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,250
and they all had some
really great components,

00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,090
but nothing was
a full solution.

00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,140
A buddy of mine was in
industrial design.

00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,060
We came up with a prototype
that did help me sit

00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,280
and relieve a lot of the pain
that I experienced.

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,180
So I launched my product
on Kickstarter in April.

00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,070
I had a $12,500 funding goal.

00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:55,100
I ended up selling 100 times
my funding goal.

00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,070
I became the first solo woman

00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,200
to break the million-dollar mark
on Kickstarter --

00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,100
-Good for you.
-And I sold -- Thank you!

00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,140
Whoo-hoo!

00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,100
I sold $1.2 million worth

00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,190
of BetterBacks
in just over a month.

00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,260
-Wow.
-Wow.

00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,220
Have you shipped
any of those?

00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,260
Right now, I have 10,000 units
that have just left my factory,

00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,170
another 10,000
that are leaving Monday,

00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,270
and the remaining 10,000 units

00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,140
are leaving at the end
of the month.

00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,100
So your customer has not yet
tried the product.

00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,140
Correct.

00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,020
Katherine, why do you think
that many people bought it?

00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,070
So in America alone,
this year,

00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:28,030
50% of working Americans
will have back pain.

00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,220
The numbers are staggering.

00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,090
$50 billion is spent
on back pain every year,

00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,270
just in the United States.

00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,210
How much does it cost you
to make them?

00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,220
My cost is $8.05 per unit.

00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,110
And you were selling that --

00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,120
And I was selling it for $49
on Kickstarter.

00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,160
You've imputed a value
of $10 million on it.

00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,060
Why?

00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,080
So, $1.2 million in sales
in just over a month.

00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,190
I have, from that,
$875,000 in the bank.

00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:57,050
I think I can land $4.5 million
in online sales next year.

00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,020
Let me stop you
with your online sales.

00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,270
How will you generate
the traffic to --

00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,190
It's one thing on Kickstarter,

00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:05,100
something else when you're
another store living online,

00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,170
trying to get the eyeballs in
to look at you.

00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,290
Absolutely.

00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,210
What's your plan for actually
making that happen?

00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:12,120
Yeah, so, two different
divergent tracks.

00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,040
One is to jump on Amazon US,
UK, Germany, and Canada.

00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,170
So there you're getting
the natural eyeballs.

00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,270
I have met an amazing --

00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,180
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no. No.

00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,090
I have a growth hacker
who has helped --
A what?

00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,130
Basically an Amazon
growth hacker...

00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,180
Right.

00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,030
...who has learned
how you optimize page,

00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,230
optimize pricing
in order to drive --

00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,170
That's all fine and good,
and you can even get up

00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,150
to search results if you get
people to search, right?

00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,240
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,060
But that doesn't
necessarily translate

00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,190
into a-a projectable number
of sales.

00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,150
I think you're asking way, way,
way too much for your valuation

00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,060
based on the sales
only on Kickstarter.

00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,250
So, for that reason,
I'm out.

00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,150
Oh, you're out all the way?

00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,190
Barbara!
Okay.

00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,260
Yeah, I'm out all the way,
but you are a great salesman.

00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,220
The challenge
is the valuation.

00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,120
Katherine: Mm.
So let's talk about that.

00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,170
I would love to see what you
guys think is a fair valuation,

00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,000
because I really want
you guys --

00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,120
You can't value it,
though, right?

00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,100
-What you've done --
-Well, I think you can value.

00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,200
You can't, though, because
what you've done is --

00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,000
Well, you can.
You can take a guess at it.

00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,140
If I had to write a check
as an angel,

00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,210
I would say, "Look,
it's a great start."

00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,090
I mean, it's always
a bit of a leap.

00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,100
Yeah, but see...
To me, it's a $3.5 million
to $5 million company.

Then the next question,
Katherine,

00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,120
is what's your core
competency, right?

00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,270
And what your core competency is
just what you've said it is.

00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:24,000
Growth hacking,
organized, promoting,

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,270
taking something and
getting it to a point
where you can ship it.

00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,130
Right?

00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,110
Now all the things
you haven't done

00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,120
is where it becomes
a real business.

00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,220
I think I'm an entrepreneur.

00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,220
Honestly, to my core,
I'm an entrepreneur.

00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,130
Yes, you are.
Yes, you are. Right?

00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,230

into these things for now.

Yes, you are.
Yes, you are,

00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:42,060

and pigeonholed yourself...

[ Sighs ]
...into BetterBack.

00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,020
And so, for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,070
No! Don't go out!
No, I didn't hear it!

00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,290

with my gut feel.

00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,200
You have all of
the right answers.
Okay.

00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,110
Um, I just don't see anywhere
close to the $10 million.

00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,240
To me,
the business is worth...

00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,190
$3.5 million, $5 million.

00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:08,200
Because all the stuff that you
have to do hasn't been proven.

00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,230
I mean, for $750,000,
which is a lot of money,

00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:15,160
the equity is about 20%.

00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,170
I mean, I look -- I see
the reaction on your face.

00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:21,040
I mean, that's -- that's what
I would offer.

00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,220

a 3x multiple

00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:27,160
on my 1.5 months
of selling, yeah?

00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,040
I'm betting on what you've
proven to me you're good at...

00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,120
Mm-hmm.

...today and with
your background.

00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:38,170
The unknown
is the risk factor.

00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:41,020
That's why
I'm valuing it there.
Absolutely.

00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,000
Katherine, give that
some serious thought.
Because you have to actually
go out and get the business.

00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,020
So that valuation
is $3.75 million.

00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,030
It's not unreasonable.

00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,020
I'll make an offer,

00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,210
but I'm actually looking at this
a little differently.

00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,100
I'll do it for 25%,

00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,120

I'm going to have to do

00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,140

It may be better.

to it.

00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,110
Greiner: Is there --
I was gonna say, is there --

00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,060
That's why we have a mounted
add-on noose chain.

00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,010
There is.

00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,111
So you can pick the
option with the chain
or without the chain.

00:27:28,111 --> 00:27:29,110
-Where?
-It's right here.

00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,210
It's mounted
onto the frame.

00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:32,030
You can actually take this,

00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,190
grab the front wheel
and the back wheel --

00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,100
directly hooked on.

00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,120
Okay, so, see, that works.

00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,150
How much is it?

00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,280
$129 MSRP.

00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,220
-And what's it cost you?
-$45.

00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,070
And if you add on the chain,

00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:43,020
I'm into it for not $139,
but how much?

00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,050
Uh, $159.

00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:45,290
$159.

00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:47,250
And how many have you sold,
Mohamed?

00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,240
We launched a Kickstarter
campaign back in May.

00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,000
and we actually did five times
our desired goal.

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,040
We hit about $130,000.

00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,170
What are your sales
since then?

00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,290
Sales since then --
about $40,000.

00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,020
What is your background?

00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,190
My background -- actually,
I didn't go a top-tier school

00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,230
or an Ivy League school.

00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,160
I went to The City College
of New York.

00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,170
That's a better school than most
of those schools.
Thank you.

00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:08,250
And I had the opportunity

00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,270
to finish my mechanical
engineering degree there.

00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:12,190
-Hey.
-And shortly after,

00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,100
I started working for Toyota
as a manufacturing engineer,

00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,030
so my background is heavily
in manufacturing and quality.

00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:21,060
I also want to say something
about where I come from

00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,290
and what makes me here --
what helps me come here.

00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:25,270
Good for you.
Want to hear it.

00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:28,160
I -- my parents immigrated
to this country

00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,240
to help make my brother's life
and I a lot better.

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,270
And they sacrificed --

00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:33,190
Where are you
from originally?

00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:35,040
Egypt.

00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,220
So they immigrated here

00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:39,030
and they wanted to make
our lives better,

00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:41,030
and they wanted
to help us succeed,

00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,100
and they sacrificed
so much.

00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,150
They left their family
and they left everything

00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,290
they knew
to bring us here.

00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:48,020
And I can't repay
them enough,

00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:51,020
so I'm doing everything I can
every single day.

00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:55,020
So go back to -- it's on there.
I'm coming out.

00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,170
How does it open?

00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:59,070
It automatically unlocks as it
recognizes your proximity

00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,190

Bluetooth low energy.

00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:03,120
Corcoran: Mohamed,
I'm your perfect customer.

00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,190
I ride a bike every single
morning of my life,

00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:07,270
but when I park my bike,

00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:10,020
there's something psychological

00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,190
when I put that chain
around a post.

00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:14,140
-Right.
-It makes me feel good.

00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:18,030
When you don't have anything
that looks like a deterrent

00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:20,170
to a thief in a big city
like New York,

00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:22,090
I think it almost says,
"Come and get it."

00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:25,120
I mean, that's a gentle alarm,

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,250
and I don't think it's enough
of a deterrent

00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:29,290
to really have a practical
application,

00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:31,200
and so for that reason,
I'm out.

00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:35,020
I'm with Barbara
on this one.

00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:38,000
I mean, I think,
in larger cities,

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,220
you're looking
for a deterrent.

00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:42,140
You're looking for a heavy chain
that a guy walks by

00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,190
and that's what stops it
from being stolen.

00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:46,100
It's a quick thing.

00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,100
So I will say, we're going
to Amsterdam on Tuesday.

00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,100
This trip to Amsterdam,

00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,230
we already have 45 meetings
lined up

00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,190
with distributors, retailers,
biking manufacturers.

00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,270
Why Amsterdam?

00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,050
'Cause that's the capital
of the bike world.

00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,240
Amsterdam has
a one-to-one ratio

00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,120
between bikes and citizens.

00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,160
I had my house broken into
many years ago.

00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,200
I called in the police
and I said to them,

00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,140
"What's the best alarm system
in the world that I can buy?"

00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,210
You know what the police officer
said to me?

00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:08,070
-Dog.
-"Buy a dog."

00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,290
I said, "Why a dog?

00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:11,050
How's a dog gonna prevent
a break-in?"

00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:13,060
"It's gonna make the burglar
think twice,"

00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,290
and I think a chain
is the same way.

00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:16,220
That, to me, doesn't look like
a deterrent.

00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,180
I'm sorry.
I'm out.

00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,130
I'm sorry to hear that.

00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:22,180
I was hoping, when Robert
was running off with it

00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,000
and it was beeping,

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,090
that it would send out 240 volts
and hit him.

00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,030
And, like,
then he'd drop the bike.

00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,230
I'd rather hear it say,
"You stole my bike.

00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:31,150
This guy's a crook."

00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:32,290
"You stole my bike, now watch
this". [ Imitates buzzer ]

You know,
we see better mouse traps

all the time in the Shark Tank.

00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,200
The challenge is this market
is already served

00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,140
by many solutions,

00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:44,100
and you've put a value on it
of $2.5 million.

00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,110
You want $250,000 from me
for 10%,

00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,150
computes to $2.5 million value.

00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:50,130
I mean, it's just --
I'm not excited

00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:52,100
about the product category,
mostly.

00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,040
I find the valuation probably
about 50% too rich.

00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,090
I'm out.

00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:58,070
I'm sorry to hear that.

00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,100
I mean, in terms of
the product itself,

00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,020
the product has so much
potential.

00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,140
I like the invention.
I think it's clever,

00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:10,240
but I think that it has to be
a much louder alarm.

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,200
I'm a city girl.
I wouldn't have even heard that.

00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,020
It would've been
white noise for me.

00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,070
I wish you great luck,

00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:21,100
but for me right now,
it's not investable.

00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,160
I'm out.

00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,220
Seriously,
we did our research.

00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,020
We talked to 300
different customers

00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,220
before we even started.

00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,280
I don't think anybody here's
doubting your preparation,

00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:34,100
the quality of the product,
the need for the product...

00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,030
All excellent.

00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,040
Yeah,
we all think it's clever.

00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,280
The issue is the competition.
Right?

00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,170
You're trying to build,
as someone said earlier,

00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:42,270
a better mouse trap.

00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:45,010
That -- that's brutally
competitive.

00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:47,070
That's why you're having
to go to Amsterdam,

00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:49,260

such an easy sale

00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:52,240
and just a blow-away
opportunity,

00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,270
you'd have
your hands full here.

00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:57,010
And so, for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:59,050

During my nine years in the
coffee and tea industry,

00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:52,150
I've noticed that coffee lovers
really like coffee

00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:54,260
because of the caffeine
and the rich texture,

00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:57,210
however they're not huge fans
of the jitters and the crash.

So I have them right now --

00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,170
they're available
at a store.
Thank you.

00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:38,250
So this is what I buy.
This is your product.

00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:41,160
I have that
and I also have it available

00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,050
in a store in Phoenix.

00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:45,040
How I started was I did
pop-up shops in Arizona,

00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,090
and then I just decided

00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:48,080
I was going to make this
my full-time job.

00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,020
I'm like
"I'm gonna give it a go,

00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:52,080
'cause I've always wanted
to start a business."

00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,240
So I hustled every day,
I live with my parents --

00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,080
it's cool -- and actually
had an opportunity

00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:03,000
to be the exclusive tea provider
for a store in Phoenix,

00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,190
and so they love the product
so much,

00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:06,250
they're like, "Oh my goodness.
You're perfect.

00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:08,090
Let's put it in there."

00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:14,060
And since then I have made
about $26,000 in sales

00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:17,060
in five months
just from the tea alone.

00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:19,130

I'm turning this into a product.

Allison: Yes.

00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,150

that little pot?

Okay.

in the pot,

something similar to that,

That was really hard.

00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:16,000
Probably one of the best
experiences,

for sure.

00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,060
I feel like it really does hurt
right now,

00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,240

this into motivation

00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,190
to do better.
