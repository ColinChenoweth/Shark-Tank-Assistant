and I think I can help
you with that.

00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,150
And we have a great team.
Absolutely.

00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,050
With that, um...

00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,260
I think you're --
We know you're a pet guy.
We know it.

00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,260
And I love dogs!

00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,010
My offer is
$200,000 for 20%.

00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,190
Well, thank you very much
for that offer.
Thank you.

00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,240
We really appreciate it.

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,150
Guys, so this very --
this is very impressive.

00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,020
I like your logistics.

00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,130
My biggest challenge is
that your --

00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,260
your not there online,

00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:22,020
and the area
that I don't want to go into is

00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,020
the premium market
of selling tchotchke stuff

00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,090
to big stores
and big outlets.

00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,110
So, at this point,

00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,260
I don't think it's for me.
I'm out.

00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,290
Thank you very much
for your time.
Thank you for your time.

00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,020
So, three Sharks are out.

00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,220
So, my question is
are you willing to negotiate

00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,230
a little bit
on the equity portion

00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,220
and come down
to meet us at 15%?

00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,210
Make me a counter.

00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,020
Uh, so --
Greiner: I haven't made you
my offer yet.

00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,010
Narrator:
Three Sharks are out.

00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:06,180
Steven and Sean have one offer
on the table from Robert --

00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:11,140
$200,000 for 20% equity in their
customized-pet-product business,

00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,190
PrideBites.

00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,070
But Lori says
she wants to make an offer.

00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,200
So, my question is
are you willing to negotiate

00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,170
a little bit
on the equity portion

00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,180
and come down to --
to meet us at 15%?

00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,020
Make me a counter.

00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,250
Uh, so --
Greiner: I haven't made you
my offer yet.

00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,010
Ooh!
Interesting!

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,120
And I'd like
to make you an offer.
Okay. Please.

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,240
Because I like
your style.

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,060
-Thank you very much.
-I like the look.

00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,270
-Thank you.
-I think it's very cute.

00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:36,150
I've sold a lot of personalized
things over the years.

00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:40,100
I know a lot my customers
really love to personalize.

00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,170
Yeah.

00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:43,290
So, I'm going to make you
an offer of $200,000 at 18%.

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,060
Uh, Robert, is there any counter
there within you could bring?

00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,090
-Ohh!
-Ohh!

00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:59,230
Would you all be willing
to join together?
To join together.

00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:02,050
What if we did
$300,000 for 20%

00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,140
and you guys came in
together?

00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,270
Such a deal!
You can't turn that down.

00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,270
$300,000 for how much?

00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,280
Uh, $300,000 for 20%.

00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:16,200
So, $300,000 for 20%, you're
saying $1.5 million value.

00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,290
With two Sharks, yeah.
With two Sharks.
You came in
at a $2 million value...

00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,290
$300,000 for 30%.

00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,110
Uh, 20%.
Sorry.

00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,250
$300,000 for 30%.

00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,050
20%.

00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,110
$300,000 for 30%.

00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,020
15% each --
You've got two Sharks,

00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,040
and you've got more cash.
-$300,000 for 30%.

00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,170
I would do that.

00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,230
If we could calm down
to 20%,

00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,160
we would make a deal
right now.

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,130
We'd love to work
with you guys.
Both of you.

00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,200
You'll get something --

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,040
We promise you,
we will never sleep.
We hustle.

00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,230
$200,000 for 20%.

00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,250
-Two Sharks?
-Two Sharks.

00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:01,020
-All right, y'all got a deal.
-Deal.

00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,040
-Done.
-Awesome.

00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,180
[ Laughter ]
Wait a minute.

00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,200
Well, are you in?

00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,290
We were at $300,000
for 30% a minute ago?

00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:15,130
Right, and we dropped it
to $200,000 for 20%.

00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,230
And Robert jumped up
and said "deal"?

00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,100
-With both -- both of you.
-I thought -- I thought both

00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,280
of y'all were coming in
on it.

00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,140
We would love --
Two Sharks are better than one.
We would love two Sharks.

00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,130
Lori's doing a little
Michael Jackson moonwalk on you.

00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,060
All right,
I'll tell you what --

00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,140
If Lori doesn't do it,
I'll do it with Robert,

00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,130
and you'll have
two Sharks.
No. I'm in.

00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,280
-Yes! All right!
-Awesome!

00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,080
-My God!
-Yes! Thank you so much!

00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,250
[ Laughter ]

00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,000
Yay!

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,130
-Thank you.
-Did you really want the deal,

00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,290
Herjavec: or you just wanted
to screw Kevin?

00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,220
[ Laughter ]

00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,050
-Thank you so much.
-[ Laughs ]

00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,100
We appreciate it.
Thank y'all so much.

00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,220
Knecht: Come on, let's go!
Hey, grab your leash!

00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,020
Grab your leash.
Let's go!

00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,290
Let's go.
Yes, dude, yes!

00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,100
Oh, my God.

00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,000
Blustein: I think having
two Sharks, you don't only get

00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,220
all the skills
and the traits

00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,040
from what Robert brings
to the table...
Yeah.

00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,260
...but also, um,
the amazing presence

00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,270
that Lori has, as well.

00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,220
And in combination
with our team,

00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,270
we feel like we can
take over the world,

00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,030
essentially,
in the pet world.

00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,080
Kevin, throw the Frisbee!
Kevin!

00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,050
Are you kidding?
This is incredibly valuable!

00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,050
Throw the Frisbee!

00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,130
No!
I don't want to damage it.

00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,180
Here you go!
Here you go, Robby!

00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,170
[ Laughter ]

00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,210
I'm at the Orgill Dealer Market
in Orlando.

00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,120
It's a huge trade show,

00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,200
and 10 of my "Shark Tank"
entrepreneurs are here.

00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,170
The Scrub Daddy is
actually lab-tested

00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:43,030
to not hold odors
for up to two months.

00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,100
Greiner: Having all my companies
in one section is like

00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,280
a magnet for retail buyers.

00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,230
Before I partnered
with these businesses,

00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:51,080
their combined sales were
about $8 million.

00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:56,000
Since I've invested,
total sales are $188 million.

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,120
Well, here's
how easy it works --

00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,160
Man: Sometimes, you can't
even get buyers on the phone,

00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,150
but at this trade show
you get to meet them,

00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,280
and you actually close the sale
right there in person.

00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,030
Put the strip right on,

00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,020
hit it with the blow dryer,
and that's it.

00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,250
Woman: Each trade show gives us
a chance to interact

00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,170
with our customers
and get real feedback

00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,230
on what
they're looking for.

00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,000
And I just got hacked.

00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,220
Well, if you'd had this,
it wouldn't have happened.

00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,130
Man: This is
my first trade show ever,

00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,050
but being in her section
with the rest

00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,100
of her entrepreneurs gives me
a ton of confidence.

00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,170
-Can I give you one of these?
-Yes.

00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,290
Man: It feels great
to be in Lori's section.

00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,120
I feel like
the coolest kid in school.

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,170
Everybody wants
to come talk to you.

00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,010
So, feel that.

00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,120
Man: Face-to-face interaction
fuels excitement and loyalty.

00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,040
They go back to their stores
invigorated to sell Scrub Daddy.

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,020
-We're doing really well.
-High five!

00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,100
Man: This has been
a killer show.

00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,240
We got so much new business,
I don't know how to keep up.

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,050
Well, we're gonna lower
the price here.

00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,220
We already sold tens
of thousands of dollars

00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,220
at this trade show.

00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,210
-It's 1,000 degrees here.
-Wow!

00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:48,050
Man: We've already sold
over $15,000 of product,

00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,030
and it's only the first day.

00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,160
Spread the word.

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,170
Woman: It's been a real
privilege doing business
with Lori.

00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,040
It really has put us
on the map.

00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,200
Excited to do business
with you. Thank you.
Us, too.

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,010
She has such a great sense
for business,

00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,200
and she's just
an incredible mentor.

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,060
So proud of all of you!

00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,040
Greiner: There isn't much more
I could ask for as an investor.

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,090
They've done sales that many
people wish to do in a lifetime.

00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:09,050
This is truly a dream come true.

00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,250
All: Team Lori!

00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,230
Narrator: Next up is a modern
version of a traditional toy.

00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,120
Hello, Sharks.
My name is Chris Harden.

00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,190
And I'm Jeremy Scheinberg,
and we're the creators of TROBO,

00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,280
the storytelling robot
from Orlando, Florida,

00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:47,050
and we're seeking $100,000 in
exchange for 10% of our company.

00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,050
How many times have you heard
a stuffed toy repeat

00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:52,270
the same mindless phrases
over and over and over again?

00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,130
And it ends up at the bottom
of that toy box after two weeks

00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,230
never to be played with
again.

00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:59,080
Well, not anymore.
Introducing TROBOs.

00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,160
TROBOs are
wirelessly connected,

00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,050
cuddly toys
that read stories

00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,000
about science and math
to children

00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,140
using tablets
and phones.

00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,290
Children
not only read along,

00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:10,030
but they also interact
with questions

00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,220
and puzzles
along the way.

00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,000
The stories are
personalized,

00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,020
and the TROBO even calls
your child by name.

00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,270
We go one step further
by actually putting

00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,100
the child
right into the story.

00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,110
The child builds
an avatar within the app

00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,260
and quickly becomes
the main character.

00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,060
Okay, Daymond --

00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,280
Time to come on down and meet
your new best friend, Newton.

00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,060
-Yes.
-[ Laughs ]

00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,100
Harden: Your adventure today,
on the TV here, is

00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,200
"What do Sharks Eat?"

00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,000
-[ Laughs ]
-Aww.

out of that stool.

TROBO: <i>Daymond, did you know</i>
<i>some sharks will eat anything?</i>

00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,200
<i>This poor shark has</i>
<i>a tummy ache</i>

All right, take
a little sippy, "Pookie."

<i>You made her tummy ache</i>

00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,040
All right.
Thank you so much, Daymond.

00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,190
-Thank you.
-Instead of landing

00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,040
at the bottom
of the toy bin,

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,150
with our growing
content library,

00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,150
TROBO's become the companions
and the teachers

00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,290
that stick around
year after year.

00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:24,080
And parents get a head start
on teaching science

00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,020
and math in the home.

00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,180
Both: Get ready, Sharks.
Here comes TROBO.

00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:32,200
Okay, these are
personalized TROBOs.

00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,120
They have
a little embroidered tag

00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,070
at the back
with your names on them.

-Yes.

Hmm, thank you.

than the first one you had.

00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,090
-Thank you. Thank you.
-They're very cuddly.

00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,060
This is where
the sound comes out of.

00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,070
Both: Exactly.

00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,190
I can't control
the tablet from here.

00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,190
Harden: Correct.

00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:52,060
So, the only purpose
of TROBO,

00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,270
besides being lovable
and cuddly, is sound?

00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,060
He's a speaker.

00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,190
He's a speaker, but really
it's an emotional connection

00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:02,220
between the child and
the stories and the content.

00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,120
Who creates
the content, Jeremy?

00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,210
It's actually
very interesting.

00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,050
We actually crowd source
the content.

00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,270
So we throw out
a story topic,

00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,230
and that --
We have a story contest.

00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,050
People submit stories,

00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,220
and we pay
for the story content.
That's a good idea.

00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,190
How much
is TROBO gonna cost?

00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:19,090
Uh, retail is $59.95 for the toy
and the first five stories.
Ooh.

00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,150
What are your sales?

00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,130
We have several buyers
who have placed orders.

00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,080
We're talking
with manufacturers, reps,

00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,180
mainly towards
mid-box retail.

00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,290
What orders do you got
in place?

00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,260
We've gotten some small
boutique orders at this point.

00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,260
How much would it come up
to be about?

00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,160
Uh, we have the total number
of orders of 600 units.

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,060
600 units -- And how many
shows did you attend

00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,120
to get those 600 units?

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,250
Two.
We attended two.
Trade shows.

00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,090
Did any of them show
great interest?

00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:43,120
We did not get
that kind of response

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,160
because we were dealing
with boutique and lower volume.

00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,220
There's so many learning apps
and, uh, you know,

00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,220
smart plush toys
in the market.

00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,240
What do you think
differentiates you?

00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,270
We've been covered
in 45 publications,

00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,260
TVs, magazines,
you name it.

00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,150
If you only have
600 orders...

00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,290
-Mm-hmm.
-...and you have

00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:03,040
45 publications
write you up,

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,240
why did the stores
not support that?

00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,230
They really -- They seemed
to be averse to risk to us.

00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,290
And we'll be straight
with you.

00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,070
This is a year and a half
into the industry for us.

00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:12,190
We have a lot of skills

00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,280
in manufacturing and execution,
but this is new for us.

00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:18,260
It's one reason why
we're here -- for you guys.
Herjavec: Chris, walk me
through the process.

00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,290
Is there a monthly fee
I pay to get more stories?

00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,140
$4.95 per story,

00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,000
and then we're gonna switch
to a subscription model.

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,290
I think if you can get
critical mass,

00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:28,280
you actually become a
very valuable marketing channel

00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,030
for a large branch trying
to sell to those kids.

00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:35,140
Basically, the plush toy is
your way to capture the child.

00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,190
-Exactly. You get it.
-Yes. Yes.

00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,170
Guys, I'm not a fan
of the idea.

00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:44,220
To me, this is
all about content, right?

00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,110
The content's
all that matters.

00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:49,170
Unless it makes the kid go
"wow," you know,

00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,040
and just was
really compelling,

00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,090
and I just didn't see that
from there.

00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:57,120
And so, you know, I don't see it
as this big blow-up,

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,160
go-out-and-crush-it type
of idea, so I'm out.

00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,020
You can't sell a $50 plush toy
with a speaker in it.

00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,020
That's not gonna work.

00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:09,030
The actual content, at $4,
that's not gonna work.

00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,140
There's tons
of free content

00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,060
for everybody
for children's books --

00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,030
free, no cost.

00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,190
Having come
from this space,

00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:20,090
you need Target,
you need Walmart to play

00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,190
in the toy space
to get huge volumes.

00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,230
They're not gonna put that
on the shelf for $50 bucks.

00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,290
It's not gonna work.
I'm out.

00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,270
Have you heard
of Teddy Ruxpin?

00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:32,270
Back in '85, Teddy Ruxpin
sold for $70 a unit.

00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:35,060
He sold $95 million.
-Yeah, but his mouth moved,

00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:38,120
eyes -- Uh, it was --
It was a different time

00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,050
when technology wasn't
at, you know, at it's level.

00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,170
The direction you're going,
I don't --

00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,290
I think you're gonna hit
a dead road.

00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,050
I'm sorry about that.
I'm out.

00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,250
Okay.
Thank you, Daymond.

00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:52,110
I think the $60 price point is
a challenge.

00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:55,230
I also listened
to the experts.

00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,200
When you went
to Toy Fair,

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,000
you didn't have
people jumping on board

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,090
from any of the large retailers
to get this in.

00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:05,240
And usually, when they see
something that's new,

00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,120
innovative,
and excites them,

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,230
they're all over it.

00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,170
So, I take that
as a caution,

00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:14,000
as a warning
to me as an investor.

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,230
So, for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,100
Robert,
before you begin --

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,040
We haven't talked
about passion.

00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,180
And I believe
that's something

00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,200
that you guys look for
regularly in your teams.

00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,150
Because I think
it's important.

00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:31,110
You're looking at a guy
who was a kid on welfare.

00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:34,010
I was one of three children
to a mom.

00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:36,080
My father died
when I was 6 years old.

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,190
She had alcohol problems.
She ended up going to prison.

00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:42,120
I learned a very valuable lesson
from my mom.

00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:47,010
She told me if I could stick to
my education day in and day out,

00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,000
I would get out from that,
and I have.

00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,020
I focused on hard work
and education,

00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,000
so I am a believer
in education.

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,170
This is what I'm offering
to you --

00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,190
Two guys who can execute
like nobody's business,

00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:00,100
and a dude who's got fire in his
belly like you've never seen!

00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,110
[ Laughs ]

00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,010
I'm asking you
to think about that.

00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,270
Herjavec: Chris, I --
I'd like to ask
all of you guys to reconsider.

00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,270
Chris, thank you
for sharing that.

00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,010
Thanks
for you passion.

00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,100
You know,
when I was in university --

00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,200
I quit university
after my first year.

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,150
And I was sitting home
one day, and my dad,

00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,280
who worked in a factory
his whole life --

00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,070
Nobody had ever gotten
past high school

00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,230
in my entire family,
so my dad sees me at home

00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,180
and says,
"What you doing home?"

00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,160
I go, "Ah, nothing.
Just watching TV.

00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,090
I, uh, dropped
out of school."

00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,190
So, he looks at me quitely,
and he says,

00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:29,000
"You know I love you.

00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,240
I kill you, bury you backyard.
Nobody ever find body.

00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,040
Go back to school."
-[ Laughs ]

00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,240
And I went back to school.
So, it's really important.

00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,170
I -- Let me tell you
where I'm at,

00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:41,180
and, uh...

00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,000
Work with us, Robert.

00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:48,000
I actually didn't --

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,150
It didn't
make me go "wow"

00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:51,270
in the application
that Daymond was using it.

00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:54,070
So...

00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,070
I don't really see it
as a toy.

00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:59,120
I see it
as a content-delivery business.

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,210
It really comes down
to the content.

00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,280
We have an amazing relationship
with DreamWorks.

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,120
They want to go in retail.
They want to sell product.

00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,040
They have amazing content.

00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,000
I think that they would do
a licensed deal.

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,230
I see it as a way
for them to sell content

00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,120
and a way
to sell plush animals

00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,000
and some more Shreks and
all kinds of other characters.

00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,260
I could broker that meeting.
We'll walk in with you.

00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,010
So, I'll make you
an offer.

00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:24,010
I'll give you $100,000
for 1/3 of the business.

00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,080

00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,270
I think the cat needs
to let go.

00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:44,200
I'm not gonna invest
in this.

00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,200
-We totally understand.
-I'm out.

00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,100
-Lori, that's cruel.

00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,140
What, come on, Robert.

00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,130
Guys, I think --
I think it's really clever.

00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,170
I mean,
you sold 3,100 units.

00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:59,150
I mean,
that's impressive.

00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:04,070
My fear is that the 3,100 units
<i>is</i> the entire market.

00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:07,090
That was only just
our store -- on one website.

00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:08,250
Right, I mean,
imagine if we did,

00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,120
you know, an infomercial
or something like that.

00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:13,190
[ Laughter ]

00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,290
-An infomercial!
-You can't --

00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:17,070
Do not invest
more money in this.

00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:19,140
-Are you kidding me?
-We've invested zero.

00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,250
Guys, guys, I'm out.

00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:25,240
Daymond?

00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,160
I would just feel stupid
investing in this.

00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,160
I'm sorry.

00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,020
You're saying
it's poo-poo on a stick?

00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,120
I don't --
I don't necessarily --

00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,210
I don't think
anybody's business is that.

00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,260
I think that
it could be a Pet Rock.

00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,240
-[ Laughs ]
-But I'm out, guys.

00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:40,200
O'Leary: Listen, the Pet Rock
was a piece of poo-poo, too.

00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,250
This is poo-poo.

00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:45,120
The best thing about this is
it's 3,100 units

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,240
and the product is
essentially nothing.

00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,120
That's a very tough thing to do.
-It's not "essentially nothing."

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,190
It <i>is</i> nothing.

00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:53,260
But we have managed to sell
nothing 3,100 times.

00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:56,020
Look, guys, it's really bad --
really bad.

00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,020
I'm out.

00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,070
All right.
Y'all have a good one.

00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,080
-Congrats, guys.
-Thank you.

00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,080
-Thanks.
-Congrats.

Gould:
You know, the Sharks,

00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:09,060
they missed
a huge opportunity here.

00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,080
This is the NoPhone.

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,070
It's the Pet Rock
of our generation.

00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,190
It's something that --

00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:16,090
You know,
it's not just a piece a plastic.

00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:17,150
Well, it is
a piece of plastic,

00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:20,010
but it's gonna be
a revolution.

00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:35,240
Narrator: Next into the tank is
a high-tech way to stay handy.

00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:47,050
Hello, Sharks.
I'm Jason Neubauer.

00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:48,160
And I'm Chris Stoikos.

00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,140
Our company is Coolbox.

00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,160
And today,
we're here seeking

00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,090
$500,000 for a 10% stake
in our company.

00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:57,160
The toolbox has been around
for over 100 years,

00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,250
and no one has been able
to significantly innovate it.

00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,050
We're here
to do just that.

00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:04,290
We have smartphones,
smart cars, and smart TVs.

00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:06,270
Why wouldn't you want
a smarter toolbox?

00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,220
Sharks,
I'd like to introduce you

00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:13,010
to the world's first
smart toolbox, the Coolbox.

00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:15,100
The Coolbox has
a very vast feature set.

00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,090
It has a power cord
that warps around the back,

00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:18,220
allows you to plug
into a socket,

00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,160
and it activates
the pass-through power points

00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,280
that go down the side.

00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:25,130
Our two latches are
very rugged.

00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,130
Lift it up, we have
a whiteboard allowing you

00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:28,240
to take notes
on the inside.

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,290
This is just dead space
on every other toolbox

00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:32,100
that's actually
out there.

00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:37,090
Turn on our light, pop it out,
put it anywhere you want.

00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:39,140
We have an iPad stand
and a iPhone stand

00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,140
that allows you to stand up
when you're inside of here.

00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,190
You can put an iPad,

00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:44,140
look at notes while you're
actually working on it.

00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,140
On the top, we also have
another iPad stand

00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:49,010
or an iPhone stand depending
on if it's opened or closed.

00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,010
The lid is magnetic.

00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:51,200
You can toss
all your screws, bolts,

00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,240
and spare parts on there

00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,050
when you're actually working
on the job site.

00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,130
We have two USB ports

00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:58,230
that allow you
to charge iPhones, iPads.

00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:00,000
We have our clock.

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,230
We have our bottle opener,
which we absolutely love,

00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:04,010
'cause we all get thirsty
from time to time while
we're working.

00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:06,060
And then
our favorite part yet,

00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,250
the wireless,
Bluetooth speakers.

00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,240
Wow.
You got everything in there.

00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,030
We've got it all.

00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:13,050
So, Sharks, we got
the nuts and bolts figured out.

00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:15,040
Which one of you guys wants
to lock up an investment

00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,030
and make the Coolbox
a household name?

00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:19,100
What do you make that for,
and what do you sell it for?

00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,000
Right now,
our cost is $110.

00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,190
We're really looking
to get that down a lot lower.

00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:26,110
We've presold them for $190,
but on --

00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,190
When we're actually retailing
them in stores,

00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,190
they're gonna be $249.

00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:30,090
John: How many
have you presold?

00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:32,280
We did a little
over $370,000 in presales.

00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,010
Have you shipped yet
to anybody?

00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,290
We have not. I'm actually
still kind of jet-lagged.

00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:38,180
I just got back from China
two nights ago.

00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,140
We were visiting
our factories there, setting up.

00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,080
They've just begun
to dug the tools.

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,040
-I love the idea...
-Yep.

00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:48,040
...but your cost is
very high,

00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,180
your margins aren't
very good,

00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:52,160
and you don't even have
retail yet or distribution,

00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,000
and you're saying the business
is worth $5 million today.

00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,090
We actually have
a huge order from Lowe's,

00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:58,110
an 8,000-unit order
from them,

00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,200
hat we want to do
an exclusive with --

00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,260
-Ah! There's the other shoe.
-So, 8,000, 8,000 --

00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:05,030
You have an 8,000-unit order.
It's a firm sale?

00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:07,030
No, they didn't.
They just basically --
They have intent to buy.

00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,120
They said,
"Come back as soon as" --
What does that mean,
"intent to buy"?

00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,170
We said we can ship to you guys
at the end of September.

00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:13,170
They said they want to do
a Q4 exclusive with us.

00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:15,160
We said we're --
-So, why wouldn't you just say,

00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,090
"Yes, done.
Give me the purchase order."

00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:19,040
And then go factored,
get it factored.
Greiner: Right.

00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,110
'Cause they don't give purchase
orders more than two months out.

00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:23,100
So when are they gonna give you
the purchase order?

00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,180
We're about --
about 30 days away.
Yeah, we're looking
to ship these units

00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,290
at the end of September.

00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:29,100
How long is the exclusive for
with those guys?
Just Q4.

00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,280
We actually had extreme interest
from Stanley Black &amp; Decker.

00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,180
I mean, the licensing of the
opportunity is huge for us.

00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:37,120
Guys, this is obviously
a capital-intensive business.

00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,040
How much have you guys put in?
Have you raised money?

00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,100
Give us
kind of the scoop.
No, we haven't.
That's what we need.

00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,090
We put in $50,000
of our own money to
bootstrap this thing.

00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,240
We need help
on the money side.

00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,290
We need people to put this in
so that we can put these orders

00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,200
and start rolling
so that when we go to Lowe's

00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,030
in these meetings,
we're saying, "Yes.

00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,160
We can deliver these
within 60 days."

00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,210
Do you have a patent
on this?

00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:54,090
Yeah, we have
a provisional patent right now.

00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:56,070
What's the patent on?
It can't be just --
Utility -- all of the

00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,190
different features combined
into one toolbox.

00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:00,250
So nobody else can put
Bluetooth speakers in a toolbox?

00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,060
It's the combination.

00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,170
It's the Bluetooth speakers,
the USB ports, the lights,

00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:07,290
the magnetic lid,
the iPad stand.
Greiner: Well,
let me ask you a question.

00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:09,200
-Yeah.
-Let's say that somebody makes

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,130
a toolbox that doesn't have
a magnetic top

00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:15,210
but has speakers.
-I think, at the end of the day,

00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:17,130
you really do want
to establish a brand go for --

00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:19,170
I think at any point
you could --
So, how are you going
to license it

00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:21,060
to Black &amp; Decker? They're
gonna rip it off in a second.

00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,160
No, they're --
We were just there.

00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,050
I was in Israel visiting
their head office.

00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:25,260
They have a head of storage
and tools.

00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,200
Because we're the first ones
in this market,

00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,150
we have the ability
to be able to, you know,

00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,140
create and shift and move
with newer innovations.

00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:35,020
How much money did you sink
into making the molds overseas?

00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:37,180
All told, it's gonna be
about $250,000.

00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:39,130
Wait, wait, wait, wait, so,
how are you gonna pay

00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:40,240
for the inventory
to deliver these?

00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,010
That's why we weren't able
to give Lowe's a definitive

00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:45,110
because you never want to
bite off more than you can chew.

00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:47,100
I understand --
-So how many units do you have

00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,170
to ship
for your $375,000?

00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:50,130
Uh, we have to ship
2,200 units.

00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:53,030
So, how are you gonna
pay for the inventory
for the 2,200 units?

00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:55,010
We're raising a total round
of $1 million, right now.

00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,120
Oh, with others?
[ All groan ]

00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,280
The million-dollar route
we were gonna do

00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,010
at a $4 million
valuation.

00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:04,150
You need $250,000
right now to just fulfill

00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:06,070
your obligation
to all the people

00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,070
that have placed orders.
-Correct.

00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:10,140
You said you kind of have
contacts at Black &amp; Decker,

00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,230
'cause I'm interested
in a licensing play here.

00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:14,180
But I really believe
that you think

00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:17,060
that you're worth $5 million,
and that's not the case.

00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:20,240
I'm gonna have to bring you down
to a realistic number.

00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:28,050
My offer is $500,000 for 25%,
but I want to license this.

00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,060
Okay.
Thank you.

00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,120
Are there -- Are there maybe --
Hear some other offers?

00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,010
Herjavec: Chris, let me --
Jason, let me tell you --

00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:37,000
I loved it
when you first came in.

00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,100
Um, at the price point
you're at, at $240 --

00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:45,010
I mean, toolboxes are
$20, $30, $35.

00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,190
They don't have
all the functionality,

00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,290
but I don't think
people care.

00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:49,160
We're not comparing
to those toolboxes.

00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,080
When you're blue-collar,
you're nitty-gritty,
you want to go in.

00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,040
You want to touch this thing.
You want to be able to see it

00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,130
when it's on the actual shelf.
I don't know, man.
If you're blue collar,

00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:57,090
are you gonna spend that kind
of money on a toolbox --

00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:00,060
240 bucks -- because
it has speakers in it?
Guys spend $200
on their speakers.

00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,130
They spend $50
on their Coolbox.

00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:03,000
All of these things
actually together costs

00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,020
upwards of $400
when you buy these things.

00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,170
And this is something
that every one of them has

00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:09,050
in their actual toolkit
when they go to the job site.

00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:10,260
You know what?
My dad was a blue collar guy.

00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,280
He just wanted a toolbox
that was sturdy and it worked.

00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,000
He didn't want
all the other crap in it.

00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,270
He would have never spent
$240 bucks on a toolbox.

00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:19,270
I see
a lot of challenges.

00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:21,210
I don't want to go down
that road with you.

00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:22,240
I'm out.
-Okay.

00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,270
-Thank you.
-Thanks, Robert.

00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:25,060
O'Leary: You know
what I'm worried about?

00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:27,120
You feel that you're gonna
be successful in retail.

00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,280
We haven't seen
sell-through yet.

00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,110
Every time
you inventory one of those

00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:34,120
into a big box retailer,
you need one to display,

00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,170
'cause people have
to see it,

00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:38,100
and then maybe two or three
that are in inventory

00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,270
to support sell-through.

00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:42,140
That's gonna tie up
a ton of cash.

00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,000
I mean, this is why
it's a license deal.

00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,010
Yeah, maybe, but --
You need somebody else
to take all that.

00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:47,060
I don't think
a licensee, either,

00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,030
isn't going
to ignore that risk.

00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:51,220
This is
a very capital-intensive --
John: But a licensee like

00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:53,110
a Black &amp; Decker
who already has the space --
Yeah, but they're the ones

00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,060
that are gonna want
complete patent protection,

00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:57,040
'cause they're
not gonna take it out.
'Cause I don't see
how you patent this.

00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,100
Stoikos: Correct,
which is what -- They're looking

00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,200
at our patent right now,
but, Kevin, how many times

00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,010
has somebody told you
the things that you're doing

00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,000
are completely risky and
you've gone on your own and --

00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,110
And those are
always the best businesses.
Of course, those are
the best businesses.

00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,170
-Look, I --
-And not that --

00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:06,230
O'Leary: I've learned something
about a business

00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:08,090
that's capital-intensive.

00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:10,290
The more successful you are,
the more capital it ties up.

00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:13,030
And the risk is
always as you're running

00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:15,180
and you're growing,
you're tying up more capital.

00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,100
Then, something changes
in the market,

00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,070
another box comes out
that becomes popular

00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,280
at a lower price,
and all of a sudden

00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:24,090
your inventory becomes
less valuable.

00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:26,170
That's the risk
I see here.

00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:27,240
I'm out.

00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,180
I mean, we're here looking
for a partner, you know?

00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,260
And at the end of the day,
like, that is --

00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,040
Herjavec:
Well, you've got a partner.

00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,050
Daymond's offered you
$500,000 for 25%...

00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:37,000
-Of course, but we're also --
-...contingent on licensing.

00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,130
We still haven't heard
from everybody yet.

00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,210
Have a bigger round.
Not everybody --

00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:41,100
I'd love to hear what...
-What are you doing, Mark?

00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,040
...Mark and Lori have to say.
-The more Sharks drop out,

00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,110
I become more valuable.

00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,180
Um...

00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,060
Cuban: Well, guys, let me help
carry things along here.

00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:50,150
I rarely, rarely
ever discuss valuation, right?

00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:52,110
Because if I think
a company's gonna grow,

00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,210
it's all gonna wash out
long-term.

00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:57,280
But you guys are really
at a very precarious point

00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,090
right now, you know?

00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:01,010
And that's what concerns me
more than anything,

00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:03,030
because the worst thing
that can happen

00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,120
to a start-up company is
to make a commitment

00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,090
and not be able to live up
to it and fulfill.

00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:10,200
And, yeah, you're going
out to raise money,

00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,080
but you're desperate,
you know?

00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,140
And you're not pricing like
you're desperate.

00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:17,210
Well, to be honest, we haven't
even started with it.

00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:19,040
This is the first place
we've came.

00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,050
A lot of the times, you don't
just invest in the product.

00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,130
You invest in the people.

00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:24,250
Is the Coolbox the best idea
in the entire world?

00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:26,090
Of course not.
There are, you know,

00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:27,170
ideas all over the place.

00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:29,180
Do we believe in it,
and do we believe it's a product

00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,090
that we've put blood,
sweat, and tears into

00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:32,230
for the last six months?
Yes, we do.

00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:34,130
Have we had other companies
where we've struggled

00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:35,240
and bounced our way
back up to the top

00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,110
and kept the people
that are impressed with us

00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:40,170
and invest with us happy?
Yes.

00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:42,030
What's gonna make you
get involved, Mark?

00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:44,160
Where are your lack
of confidences?

00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,180
The lack of confidence is

00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,010
there's nothing
that's protectable.

00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,190
That's the part
that keeps me away

00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:52,030
because you could be going
full speed ahead,

00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,140
but then someone could
just knock you off,

00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,170
and it's gone.
[ Snaps fingers ]

00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:56,210
And that's my hesitancy.
I'm out.

00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,030
Two Sharks left.

00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:05,210
Now, the risk you have is
if Lori goes out,

00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,280
Daymond may adjust his offer,
'cause he's greedy.

00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,090
And so maybe
you should accept it now

00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:12,140
before you find out the outcome
of what Lori's gonna do.

00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,040
-I'm willing to take a risk.
-There's a fair amount of risk

00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,190
right now in the Shark Tank.
-And I hope that maybe

00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:17,140
hopefully they both like
each other,

00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,160
and maybe they want
to work together.
Oh, you want to take
that gamble?

00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,090
Narrator:
Three Sharks are out.

00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:37,150
Jason and Chris have
one offer on the table

00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:41,040
from Daymond for their
high-tech toolbox, Coolbox.

00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,290
But they have yet to hear
from Lori.

00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:46,190
O'Leary: Now the risk
you have is if Lori goes out,

00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:48,230
Daymond may adjust his offer,
'cause he's greedy.

00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:50,100
Do you want to take
that gamble?

00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,230
Do you want
to tighten up your offer

00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:55,170
and give us a little bit
of a better valuation?

00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,150
Neubauer: Or is there any way
to do it without, I mean --

00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:01,240
I really not want an investment
tied on the licensing.

00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,060
It's not
that I'm not open to it.

00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,070
I just would not like that tied
to the investment.

00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:07,290
Okay.
Take your chances with Lori.

00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:10,050
Greiner: since "Shark Tank,"
I find that I am very heavily

00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:13,090
in the hardware space,
unusually --

00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:18,120
so I'm all over
Home Depot, Lowe's,

Ace, True Value,
these places.

00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,190
So, this <i>can</i> fit

00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:25,130
within my family
of entrepreneurs.

00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:28,070
The thing -- I agree with
Daymond and the other Sharks.

00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:30,290
We don't know yet
if the market's going

00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:33,260
to pay that much money
for this.

00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:37,110
So, for me
to give you an offer,

00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:39,240
I feel I would need...

00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:46,060
I would give you
the $500,000.

00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,200
But I'd need a 30%.

00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,080
-Ohh.
-Whoa.

00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,180
-Good think you waited.
-Not contingent --

00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:55,200
Not contingent on licensing.
-How about that power drill,

00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,210
kids?
-But --

00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:58,070
-I'd say it was deep.
-I feel --

00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:01,000
I'm gonna make it contingent
on one thing.

00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,170
It's that Lowe's,
for sure, is going

00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,130
to be giving you
a purchase order.

00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,010
Yeah.

00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:09,180
All right, Chris, Jason,
you got two offers. Both
have a contingency.

00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,080
I'm gonna recant
my offer.

00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,260

$500,000 for 20%.

We have these sales
right now.

Through, like we telling you,
all these P.O.s.

00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:28,000
And, again,
it's contingent upon that.

00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,100
You can come
to the next meeting.

00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,050
We'll go over to North Carolina
and meet with the buyer.

00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:33,010
We'll check out
all the different spots...
Shh.

00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:42,160
I'll give you $500,000
as a line of credit,

00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,140
which is a loan,
at 5% interest,

00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:48,230
and then I'll get
15% equity in the company.

-Thank you.

striking a deal with Lori

00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:18,170
elevates us
to the next level.

00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:20,120
I mean, there's certain things
in relationship experience

00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,110
that we don't have,
and she just gives us

basically
that checkmark box
