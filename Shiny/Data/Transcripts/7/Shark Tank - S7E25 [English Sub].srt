that the best way
to go to market with Drip Drop

So, how do you guys make
your prototypes, your samples?

00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,210
Yeah,
so that was actually

00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,130
one of our biggest challenges
along the way

00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,210
is making the prototypes.

00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,210
So we had to start with
a 3-D model of our Drip Drop,

00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,260
and from there we turned that
into a silicone mold,

00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,180
which we make
homemade batter

00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,000
and pour that
into the silicone mold.

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,190
And then we just pop them
in the toaster over,

00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,260
and out comes Drip Drops.

00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,240
What's it cost you to make it?
What are you selling it for?

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,160
We've estimated
that the Drip Drop

00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,140
will cost the ice cream cone
manufacturers

00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,240
about 3.2 cents to make.

00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,180
And then they'll sell that
to the ice cream stores

00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,180
for about 10 cents.

00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,160
How much does a cone cost?

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,260
A cone costs
about 5 cents.

00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,280
So, do you think
it's a problem

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,160
that you're almost doubling
the price of the cone?

00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,230
Well...
no, because, um,

00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:06,190
I think there's a real need
for the kids and their parents,

00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:09,150
so I think they're gonna pay
an extra quarter for it.

And it's also --
There's, um...

00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,280

want an extra cookie treat

of their ice cream, so...
[ Laughs ] More food.

00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,180

then more sprinkles...

even bigger.

I have a problem here.

Your Drip Drop
is dripping like crazy.

It's coming off the edge.
O'Leary:
It's on an angle, though.

00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,190
Like -- Like we've said,

00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,000
we're just making these at home
as prototypes,

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,120
so, obviously, if we went
to a manufacturer,

00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,020
we would make sure

00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,260
that the design is perfect
and catches all the drips.

00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,040
You'd raise the lip
a little bit.
Oliver: Yeah.

00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,190
And that's -- And that's where
we want to use some of the money

You're 14 years old.

00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:53,220
The key
is really the patent.
Yeah.

00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,240

something you're gonna sell

ice cream stores.

Cuban:
Well, I would disagree.

00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,270
I would take them
to the ice cream stores

00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,270
and give it to them
initially for free

00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:05,050
so they'd want more,
you know?
So, what, Mark,

00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,170
by the time they're 30,
they're making money on it?
No, no.

00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,290
If there's
a bunch of people using them

00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:11,230
and everybody's seeing them,
then you start creating demand

00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,210
and you get more feedback
and you learn.

00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,170
And then, you know,
once they came back for more,

00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,230
you can start
charging them.
Okay.

00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,270
And then
it builds from there.

00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,250
You don't need to make it
perfect, all right?

00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,280
You just got to get
people using it and learn.
Yeah.

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,230
But while I think it's gonna be
a great opportunity,

00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,270
it's gonna take
a lot of time.
Yeah.

00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,170
It's gonna take
a lot of work,

00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,250

with you guys in school.

Hey, guys, I completely disagree

00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,190
There's only one path.

00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,180
You got to go
to the large manufacturers.

00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,200
They got to license it.

00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,230
It comes down to a patent.

00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,210
There's no demand,
there's no need for a license.

00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,290
That's not true.
You...

00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,220

you're gonna make money.

at a time,

a little hobby business.

are really smart guys.

00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,170

You got on "Shark Tank."
Oliver: Yeah.

You can pick up the phone
and make that call

00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,270
or write an e-mail
and get in front of them.

00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:09,110
Yeah, I mean, we just want a
high-profile Shark like you guys

00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,032
just behind our back.

00:09:10,032 --> 00:09:12,130
It's great to have a Shark
on your team,

00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,190
but it's too early.

00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,200
It's just not for me.
Okay.

00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,210

00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,230

00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,200
What's remarkable
about this product,

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,200
it's sort of timeless.

00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,030
In 100 years from now,

00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,240
the ice cream cone will
still be the ice cream cone.

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,140
So maybe the strategy
for you guys

00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,230
is to finish high school

00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:31,260
and then run this ring

00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,280
of ice cream-stopping-dripping
technology, you know?

00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,250
If that's what you want to do
by the time you get there.

00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,180
Meanwhile,
you still own the patent.

00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,240
That's what's unique
about this.

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,230
Um, the --
the work involved

00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,230
in getting a large manufacturer
to take this on

00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,180
is a fair amount of work.

00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,030
I mean, it's --
even for a Shark.

00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:52,200
They'll return our calls,
but we still got to do the work.

00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,030
So while
you're in school,

00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:57,220
I'm working for you
and I paid you $50,000 to do it.

00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,280
It should be
the other way around.

00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,200
The thing is,
I mean, that --

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,010
I mean, we think that,
with your money,

00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,210
we can take care of everything
except for the final step

00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,270
of you just calling these
ice cream cone manufacturers

00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,200
and just negotiating
the deal.

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,270
Look, I admire you guys.

That's very cool.

00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,210

the same thing.

00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,270

to take on the work.

00:10:46,119 --> 00:10:48,349
You've got a lot of things wrong
with the business, I think.

00:10:48,349 --> 00:10:50,269
So I'll just
give you the list.

00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:52,329
Um, I don't think
it's a licensing deal.

00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:55,099
I think it's an upsell
at the ice cream store.

00:10:55,099 --> 00:10:56,339
And I think you have to go out
and sell it yourself.

00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:57,359
That's what I think.

00:10:57,359 --> 00:11:00,279
However, I think
you have a faulty design here.

00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:02,099
I don't think
it looks pretty enough.

00:11:02,099 --> 00:11:05,289
I tell you the way
to make it look really pretty --

00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:06,379
a lot of chocolate,
a lot of sprinkles.

00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:09,239
But even
the shape of it --
This one looks pretty.

00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:10,119
All the good stuff,
right?

00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:12,259
Yeah, I mean, that's --
that's what we have up here.

00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:13,339
That's what looks great to me
up there.

00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,099
I love the concept.
I think it's great.

00:11:16,099 --> 00:11:18,189
I think it's a licensing play
because I think

00:11:18,189 --> 00:11:20,359
you could go to one
of the big manufacturers...
Herjavec: Me, too.

00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:23,269
...and they could distribute
when they sell their cones

00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:25,299
to all the different
ice cream stores.

00:11:25,299 --> 00:11:27,389
Have them do the work.
You've got the patent.

00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:30,269
I'm not going to give you
the $50,000

00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:32,129
because I don't want
to take 20%.

00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:35,099
I think that you can get
on the phone, get to somebody,

00:11:35,099 --> 00:11:38,389
have them license it,
and then keep it all.

00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:43,209
So for that reason, I'm out.
But I wish you good luck.

00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:43,730

go for a different approach,

00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,139
I mean, we're really willing
to do whatever you think --

00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:11,349
You know, I just think there's
two faults to the product.

00:12:11,349 --> 00:12:13,309
One is it doesn't
look cute enough.

00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:15,259
It needs a rippled edge
like that...

00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:16,309
Mm-hmm.
And we can make that happen.

00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:17,329
...like a doily.

00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:19,359
And I'm sure
that's a baking possibility.

00:12:19,359 --> 00:12:21,369
Secondly,
it doesn't taste good.

00:12:21,369 --> 00:12:24,239

There's no taste.
It was okay. It was okay.
Yeah.

has to be brought up to speed.

That's okay.
You can fix that.
With a food engineer,
we could --

Wow.

saying, "I want a kid runner.

of your ambassador athletes."

for you to tell me

Where we are right now is we've
set up retail ambassadors.

We have
an e-commerce plug-in.
You love
this ambassador thing.

really important for us,

of some of the questions
you guys have been asking.

00:28:43,195 --> 00:28:45,185
But for us,
that was two years ago.

00:28:45,185 --> 00:28:46,225
So, we've been asking

have been asking for years.

Why has it taken you years
to get to a 95% ready point?

Well, it's taken us
three years

00:28:54,315 --> 00:29:00,235
because the technical design,
engineering solutions for this

00:29:00,235 --> 00:29:03,185
are radically complex.

Will, I want to say something.

00:29:04,425 --> 00:29:05,285

This is what I'm really
disturbed about.

00:29:07,265 --> 00:29:11,205
I think you're the type of
person who's a careful plotter.

00:29:11,205 --> 00:29:15,225
So I don't believe that
you're the kind of entrepreneur

00:29:15,225 --> 00:29:19,405
that is really going to get it
out there and done finally

00:29:19,405 --> 00:29:20,325

who are potentially still in,

00:29:27,295 --> 00:29:29,305
I want to disavow
everything you just heard,

hearing it.

from any of those?

for a $200 deposit

our pre-order campaign.

the safety aspect.

So, I started this business
out of the garage of my home.

00:35:20,734 --> 00:35:26,654
And I grew it the first year
from $150,000 worth of sales

00:35:26,654 --> 00:35:29,664
to $850,000
the second year.

00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,664
What does one cost?

00:35:31,664 --> 00:35:34,574
They're actually sold
in a package of four.

00:35:34,574 --> 00:35:35,684
And they're sold
for $12.95.

00:35:35,684 --> 00:35:37,824
How much does it cost you
to make them?
How much --

00:35:37,824 --> 00:35:38,834
$1.44.

00:35:38,834 --> 00:35:39,734
O'Leary: $1.44?

00:35:39,734 --> 00:35:41,844
Personalized, as well?
Personalized, as well.

00:35:41,844 --> 00:35:43,634
Listen,
you're the real deal.

00:35:43,634 --> 00:35:47,574
What are you selling, though,
Orbit Labels or MyDrinky?

00:35:47,574 --> 00:35:48,644
What I'm offering to you

00:35:48,644 --> 00:35:50,734
is I'm offering you
a portion of my business.

00:35:50,734 --> 00:35:53,624
So, it's
everything together.
That's correct.

00:35:53,624 --> 00:35:56,574
Is this tried-and-true?
Do you know if this is working?

00:35:56,574 --> 00:35:57,724
Yes, it's
absolutely working.

00:35:57,724 --> 00:35:59,674
Only to $50,000, though.
That's it. Well --

00:35:59,674 --> 00:36:02,664
O'Leary: When you compare
the success of the Orbit Labels

00:36:02,664 --> 00:36:05,574
versus MyDrinky,
MyDrinky's a dog.

00:36:05,574 --> 00:36:06,664
The labels are where
the action is.

00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:07,724
I don't think
this is ever gonna be

00:36:07,724 --> 00:36:10,574
what the Orbit Labels are.
Let's hear her out.

00:36:10,574 --> 00:36:11,614
Well, let me
explain to you

00:36:11,614 --> 00:36:12,704
why those sales
are where they're at.

00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:16,594
Our manufacturer is based here
in the U.S., had two plants.

00:36:16,594 --> 00:36:17,714
One plant burned down.

00:36:17,714 --> 00:36:20,644
But what ended up happening is
they start shifting their work,

00:36:20,644 --> 00:36:22,794
appeasing
their larger clients.

00:36:22,794 --> 00:36:23,684
Okay?

00:36:23,684 --> 00:36:26,644
So, we have had a big issue
with just inventory.

00:36:26,644 --> 00:36:28,694
So, Orbit Labels,
where does it flatline?

00:36:28,694 --> 00:36:30,854
Okay, so right now,
we're at $2 million.

00:36:30,854 --> 00:36:31,744
Per year.
Per year.

00:36:31,744 --> 00:36:34,664
And that's actually
been for the past four years.

00:36:34,664 --> 00:36:36,674
So, they've leveled out.
It's flat. It's flat.

00:36:36,674 --> 00:36:39,604
So, right now it's been
just a small incline.

00:36:39,604 --> 00:36:40,724
Now,
this particular product

00:36:40,724 --> 00:36:43,814
is one that I think
would be wildly successful

00:36:43,814 --> 00:36:45,604
in the retail market.

00:36:45,604 --> 00:36:47,664
-Whoa.
-And this is --

00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:49,684
Have you ever played in the
retail space with a product?

00:36:49,684 --> 00:36:51,684
No, and that's why I need --
that's why I need a partner.

00:36:51,684 --> 00:36:52,714
I swear to you,
you are lucky.

00:36:52,714 --> 00:36:54,644
It looks so much better
from the outside.

00:36:54,644 --> 00:36:56,614
And even if you
get into the stores,

00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:58,604
you have to worry
about your inventory,

00:36:58,604 --> 00:37:00,644
monitoring, them sending
inventory back to you.

00:37:00,644 --> 00:37:02,674
It's a huge problem.
A whole different business.

00:37:02,674 --> 00:37:05,644
You've built a franchise online,
and you have customers

00:37:05,644 --> 00:37:08,634
that are very happy
to buy from you online.
Yeah.

00:37:08,634 --> 00:37:09,724
Why mess with retail?

00:37:09,724 --> 00:37:12,764
I hate Drinky-poo in retail.
That sucks.

00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:25,730
Narrator:
All sharks are still in,

00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:28,690
but they are skeptical
about Brenda's desire

00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:31,720
to take her kids' drink holder,
MyDrinky, into retail.

00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,730
You should just focus
on the label.

00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:37,710
You've built a franchise online,
and you have customers

00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,680
that are very happy
to buy from you online.
Yeah.

00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,780
Why mess with retail?

00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:43,800
I hate Drinky-poo in retail.
That sucks.

00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,900
I mean, 'cause you
have to give half your margin.

00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:46,790
Who wants that?

00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:49,750
Okay, we've been in our business
for almost 10 years.

00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,750
If you walk into
any daycare facility,

00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:54,660
you'll most likely find
one of our labels there.

00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,660
Got it.

00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:56,700
So we want to capitalize
off of that.

00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,640
Greiner:
You can give it a whirl,

00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,680
but to take
a lot of inventory,

00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,770
get stock into stores,

00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:04,700
if it doesn't work
and maybe get it back,

00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,730
that would be
a problem for you.

00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:07,760
Well,
I know there's interest,

00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,720
because I am negotiating
with a big-box store.

00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,690
Herjavec: Yeah,
but, Brenda, don't forget,

00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:12,920
people in retail
like new things,

00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,740
but it may not
sell through.

00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:17,780
You have $2 million worth
of basically recurring revenue.

00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:20,900
You're living the dream,
and the grass is always greener.

00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:21,900
Retail is hard.

00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,710
I'm out.

00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:24,760
Thank you very much.

00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,750
Cuban: Look, Brenda, you're
taking on a whole new business,

00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:29,660
but you're not really playing
into your core competency,

00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,710
which is customizing.

00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:33,650
And you're selling
$2 million worth, right?

00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:34,750
You're killing it.

00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:37,780
But instead, you're --
you're trying to go in this
whole new world of retail,

00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:41,640
which doesn't play to
the thing that makes you
different and better

00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,760
and has really
made you your money.

00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,680
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,750
Thank you.
That's -- That's disappointing.

00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:50,740
Brenda, I think the beauty of
a juice box is it's one step --

00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,790
pop the straw,
and end of story.

00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:57,650
You managed to take a simple
process that every mom loves

00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:58,700
and make it complicated.

00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,810
I would never
spend the time

00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:03,670
opening that up, putting the box
in, putting the cap on,

00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,700
then putting the straw in.

00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,730
It defeats
the whole purpose.

00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:08,660
So you're here selling
really a waning business

00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,630
with your eye
on the wrong ball,

00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,740
and for that reason,
I'm out.

00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:14,730
Well, I-I do believe there is
future for this product.

00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:16,820
Greiner:
What I think is...

00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,810
It's like the saying,
if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:22,830
If you've got a winner,
don't quit it, don't change it.

00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:26,640
Just keep going with it
until it doesn't work anymore.

00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,720
You're gonna make it,

00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,910
and I wish you the best,
but I'm out.

00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,770
Thank you.
Appreciate that.

00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,710
O'Leary:
Okay, here's my thoughts.
Okay.

00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,920
Usually, when a company
comes into Shark Tank,

00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,680
it's either going to work

00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,770
and you're gonna have
a huge growth trajectory

00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:41,910
or it's gonna fail
and we're gonna lose our money.

00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:44,920
I would give you
the $400,000.

00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:49,680
We agree on a royalty.
Your margins are huge.

00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,650
You could probably pay me
a dollar on every one you sell

00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:54,630
until I get back
three times on my money,

00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:55,680
and then it goes away.

00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,650
There's no perpetuity here,
but I own 5% of your business,

00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:00,700
which keeps me interested
in working with you.

00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,630
The beautiful thing about your
business that attracts me to it

00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:04,730
and why I'd like
to work with you is --

00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:07,750
Take Wicked Good Cupcakes, run
by two women, and we want to --

00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:08,880
Oh, no.
Not Wicked again.
Will you shut up,
Barbara?

00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,770
It's important
information here.
I'm so tired
of hearing about that.

00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:13,750
Wicked again. That's an
offer from a pig, Brenda.
You should know that.

00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,660
Well, how are you
gonna help me?

00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,660
O'Leary: You'll meet
my social-media team.

00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,660
They're amazing.

00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,750
I will put you on
to everything we do

00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,720
on television,
print, and online.

00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,670
He's asking three times
on repayment. He's nuts.
Brenda, listen.

00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:25,750
I don't need Barbara
to negotiate my deals,

00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,710
'cause she actually isn't
very good with numbers.

00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,700
He's a greedy man.
You know that.
It doesn't matter.

00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,690
My deal is very fair to you,
frankly, because --

00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:32,810
But I am negotiating
with a big-box store.

00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:34,900
I'm just doing
the final paperwork.
Oh, you love
the retail siren.

00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,710
Well, I just want
to let you know...
You know, I'm sorry.
I'm not going there.

00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,680
...I probably have about
$1 million worth of growth

00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,880
anticipated for next year
with this product.

00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,630
Brenda, I'm gonna put -- I'm
gonna put a contingency on it.
They're ordering
$1 million worth?

00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:46,750
I don't want to invest

00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:50,800
in a business
that is going into retail.

00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:56,760
You have no idea
what you're doing, trust me.

00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,780
You're gonna
take capital...
Well --

00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:01,660
...and you're gonna
tie it up in inventory,

00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,680
and it's going to float
for 90 to 100 days

00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,700
before you get it back,

00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,670
and some of this product
may not sell.

00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:08,700
If that's your burning desire
and you want to do that,

00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,640
I don't want
to invest in you, okay?

00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,680
Well, I-I feel
as I'm on the path to it,

00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,700
because I'm --
I'm negotiating with someone.

00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,920
I understand that,
but it doesn't mean you --

00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,690
This is
a critical moment.

00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:18,710
He is telling you
"I do not see that vision,

00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,680
and if you do it,

00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,680
I'm not going to give you
the investment."

00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,920
You know, I feel confident
that I can --

00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,730
I can grow this business.

00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:29,870
What I want to do is grow
a wholesale arm of InchBug.

00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:30,760
It's binary.

00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,780
I told you what I want in --
in you and how I can help you.

00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,660
Herjavec: All right, Brenda,
you have an offer.

00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,840
What are you gonna do?

00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:45,850
Okay, so, I thank you very much
for your offer.

00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:53,730
But I just cannot see myself
giving up this opportunity

00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:55,710
to really exponentially
grow my business.

00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:59,850
Then I have to say it.
You're dead to me, Brenda.

00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:00,690
Thank you.

00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:01,850
Thank you.
Corcoran: Thank you.

00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:03,860
♪♪

00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,700
I think Kevin lost today,

00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:12,680
'cause I think MyDrinky
is going to make it in retail.

00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,640
I think it's gonna be
wildly successful,

00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,700
and I'll continue
working hard.

00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,720
There's no reason to quit
at this point.

00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,770
She's killing it.

00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:19,740
Why does she want to do
something different like that?

00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:20,770
-She is so smart, so smart.
-I feel sorry for her.

00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:22,700
She's bored after 10 years
of doing the same old thing.

00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,740
