Narrator: Tonight,
Silicon Valley billionaire

00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:04,070
Chris Sacca returns to the Tank,

00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,090
where entrepreneurs seek
an investment

00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,110
to start, grow, or save
their businesses.

00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,090
A lot of people just gravitate
towards this idea.

00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,270
We are completely
revolutionizing early education.

00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:14,150
Let me show you how it works.

00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,200
Narrator: If the Sharks hear
a great idea...

00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,100
Hmm.

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,130
Narrator: ...they'll invest
their own money...

00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,100
You have a lot of passion
about what you're doing.

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,130
Narrator: ...and fight
each other for a deal.

00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,150
-Are you really that clueless?
-No, I'm just -- I'm --

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,100
It's a crappy idea.
Why are you yelling at me?
It's not my company.

00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,150
Narrator:
But the entrepreneurs must get

00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,050
the full amount
they're asking for...

00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,050
Have you invested
any money in this?
Yes.

00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:33,160
Can we have a moment of silence
for that dead money?

00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,150
Narrator: ...or they'll
walk away with nothing.

00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,130
I see all the challenges,
and that's why we're here.

00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,020
I haven't heard
you speak up, Mark.

00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,080
I'm listening, right?

00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,060
Mind your own business,
if you don't mind, "Mr. Baldy."

00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,090
It's evil!

00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:45,060
This is the worst idea
I've ever heard on "Shark Tank."

00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,280
[ Laughs nervously ]

00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,170
Narrator:
Who are the sharks?

00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,250
They're self-made
business experts worth billions.

00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,030
Kevin O'Leary is
a shrewd venture capitalist

00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,060
who made his fortune

00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,040
selling a children's
educational company

00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,270
for over $4 billion.

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,110
Daymond John dominated
the fashion world with Fubu.

00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:12,110
Now he's the branding expert
behind multiple global brands

00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,150
generating billions in sales.

00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:17,100
Barbara Corcoran went
from waiting tables in Manhattan

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,120
to building the city's premier
$2 billion real-estate empire.

00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,020
And Mark Cuban, esteemed
billionaire, tech mogul,

00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,110
and the outspoken owner
of the Dallas Mavericks.

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,130
And billionaire investor
Chris Sacca left

00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,110
his high-profile position
at Google

00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,050
at the height of his career
to start

00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,150
his own venture-capital fund,
which is now

00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:40,150
one of the highest-performing
investment funds in history,

00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:44,260
with early investments
in Twitter, Instagram, and Uber.

00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,000
First into the Tank is
a modern way to find

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,170
and buy the latest styles.

00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,080
Hi, Sharks.

00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,110
My name is Amy Roiland,

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,120
and I live
in Los Angeles, California.

00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,080
I'm the C.E.O. and founder
of FashionTap.

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,100
I'm currently seeking $100,000
for 10% of my company.

00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,160
FashionTap is
a fashion, social-networking app

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,260
that puts bloggers, brands,
and other influencers

00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,050
at your fingertips.

00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,060
FashionTap allows
anyone to make money

00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,080
off the clothing
that they're already wearing.

00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,180
Let me show you how it works.

00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,140
FashionTap users create content
on the app, tag it,

00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,150
and then share it
with their followers.

00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:38,050
You can tag anything from
your eye shadow to your shoes.

00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,000
This is Erica.
Erica's a fashion blogger.

00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,080
Erica's followers
already look to her

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,070
for fashion inspiration and how
to style the latest trends.

00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,100
With FashionTap,
if her followers are drawn

00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,140
to a tagged item, like this
gorgeous statement necklace,

00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,100
they can just tap that tag,
and that tag will take them

00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,020
directly to the online store

00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,040
where that item is available
for purchase.

00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,030
Now, Erica makes
a commission on each sale,

00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,100
so she's incentivized
to tag what she's wearing.

00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,040
And on FashionTap,
her followers never have to ask,

00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,100
"Where did you get that," again.

00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,080
Brands and retailers love us
because bloggers

00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,080
and online influencers are
the newest

00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,070
and best way
to market your brands.

00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,080
FashionTap was born
out of my love of fashion

00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,290
and my dream of connecting
the whole fashion world.

00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,010
Let's make it happen.

00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,140
Okay, so,
this is already happening

00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:26,020
on multiple platforms --
Instagram, Facebook.

00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,030
Why you?
What do we need you for?

00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,130
Right.
So, I'm a fashion blogger.

00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,190
There's a huge void
in fashion networking.

00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,140
Instagram is not comparable,
really, to what I've created.

00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,090
You can't directly
tag products on there.

00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,130
If someone posts sunglasses,
they can tag the brand name,

00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,050
but they can't tag
that exact thing

00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,100
that you can buy.

00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,140
And they're not incentivized,
and they don't get money.

00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,100
Aren't you concerned
that Instagram could

00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,120
just add links
to their tags?

00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,030
Not really because Instagram is
an everybody network.

00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,080
It's not a fashion network.

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,200
And when you hashtag "fashion,"
you see dogs, food.

00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,090
It's getting more and
more cluttered in that sense.
No question.

00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,050
You can also post
your Instagram photos

00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,060
onto the app, and everything's
written there for you.

00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,060
Just tag it.

00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,110
How do you make money
doing this?

00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,130
Okay, so, we have
three revenue streams.

00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,060
The first one is e-commerce
that I'm currently building

00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,120
into the app right now.

00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,070
And so,
off the big-box retailers,

00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,150
we take 10% of every sale.

00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,140
But then, those retailers have
to put all that stuff

00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,040
in your inventory
and make it tagable, right,

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,130
in order for them
to agree to your deal.

00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,120
Right, so,
when we're building that out,

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,150
we would negotiate with them
and do direct.

00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,090
What are the bloggers doing?
Well, those are hard deals
to do, right?

00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,030
Corcoran: Have you tried to do
any of those deals

00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,080
with a big-box store?

00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,090
As a blogger,
I work with Free People,

00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,260
Jeffrey Campbell --
like, pretty big brands.

00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,290
I have a lot of followers,

00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,100
so I do have
those direct connections.

00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:44,030
So, once I build this database,
or the user base, up,

00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,090
I think that it won't be
too hard.

00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,080
You've got to have enough people
for them to be interested.

00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,070
Exactly, so --
How many downloads
have you had?

00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,120
What's your
monthly active users?

00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,070
So, we have
6,000 downloads to date.

00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,010
We just launched --
-Over what period of time?

00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,060
-Six months.
-Six months, okay.

00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,070
So we just launched
the soft launch six months ago.

00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:02,020
And our monthly
active users is 1,500.

00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,160
And it's been
really organic marketing

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,050
through just my channels
and me being a blogger.

00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,110
So, I haven't done any
paid advertising or anything.

00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:14,040
The second revenue stream
would be sponsorships.

00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,270
So, we would
facilitate sponsorships

00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,170
with big brands, right?

00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:19,050
So, they would send me
the denim jackets plus money,

00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,080
and then I would pay out
the top users, bloggers,

00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,060
and models or influencers
on the app to wear those jackets

00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,080
in several different ways
and style them.

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,130
And then, we'd put them
on the "popular" page

00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,070
so you could see
all these girls --

00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,110
you know, different sizes

00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,150
of girls wearing these outfits
in different ways.

00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:35,060
How much money would that
girl get who's modeling that

00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,060
for you, for example?
-Okay, so that would be

00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,040
the third one, which is
affiliate links built in.

00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,100
So, if somebody clicks
and buys any of this stuff

00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,160
that these girls are tagging,

00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,090
they're gonna get anywhere
between 3% and 35% of that sale,

00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,050
dependent on what the retailer
has done with the affiliate.

00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,040
What's your revenue
with that model now?

00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,120
Okay, so, since the six months,
we have $60,000.

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,010
Your first six months
in business,

00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,120
and you have $60,000
in sales.

00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,150
How much have you netted
from that?
And that means $6,000
would be?

00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,120
So what we would get would be
the 1% to 15% of that $60,000.

00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,150
-But what have you gotten?
-$6,000.

00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,200
We haven't taken anything
because I'm giving it

00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,020
all back to the users,
the bloggers, so they --
So you're giving them the
full affiliate fee right now.

00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,040
-Yes.
-Amy, how are you eating?

00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,150
Why aren't you starved
to death now?

00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:16,020
I'm really excited about this.
I think this is --

00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,280
I know,
but you can't eat excitement.

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,170
How are you living?

00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,150
I'm living off my savings,
and I have a chairman.

00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:24,050
He's fronted $90,000
to create the app.

00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,280
How much of the company
does he own?

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,060
38%.
And I have 33%.

00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,140
I'd say $90,000 to get this far
is actually really good.

00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,180
Who owns the rest
of the company?

00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:36,020
Yes, so, my C.O.O. has 5%,
and my C.T.O. has 23%.

00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,120
And then 1%
to the developer.

00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,170
Well, what do you need
the money for?

00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:42,100
I want to use the $100,000
for strictly marketing.

00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,270
-Yeah.
-That's it.

00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,140
I won't be paying myself.

00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,090
I just want
to use it for marketing

00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,040
to really get
my user base higher.

00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,020
What are you gonna do
if it doesn't work?

00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,050
Because getting --
going from six months in,

00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,040
and then all of a sudden
only spending $100,000

00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,080
and hoping you're gonna start
becoming viral, right?

00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,260
So if
that $100,000 doesn't work,

00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,180
what happens then?

00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,130
Then, I'll just keep going
and going and marketing this.

00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:10,040
And I think that it's
an amazing idea and, like --

00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,050
But you know how hard it is
to all of a sudden catch fire

00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,120
after six months in.

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,140
But we pay our users
to use the app.

00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,050
Like, that's really
incentivizing.

00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,070
You need to tell me
something better

00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:23,030
because 100k isn't
a lot.

00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,140
If we scale
to 100,000 monthly active users

00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:29,050
on the app, we will have
$7 million for the year

00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,120
of gross sales -- total sales.

00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,020
And that's just doing
a straight line, right?

00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,110
Yes.
And so -- And then --

00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,030
That's straight affiliate,
you're saying.

00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,090
If we add in
the e-commerce, as well.

00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:40,100
And your goal is to get
to a bigger affiliate fee

00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,080
because you're gonna have
direct deals...

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,160
-Exactly.
-...with all these providers.

00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,110
I didn't hear anything
in your business plan

00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,040
about the army
of business-development folks

00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,030
you're gonna need
to go do those deals.

00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,070
Those are hard deals
to do.

00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,170
They're already cut pretty thin
in their businesses,

00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,080
and they're certainly
not gonna want to cut

00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,140
a big, fat piece
of margin for you,

00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,070
considering
your relative size.

00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,170
It's gonna take
a lot of time.

00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:04,020
But how will you do it?
How are you building that
into your business?

00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,080
I just think
the biggest issue right now is

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,050
finding these brands.

00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,080
There is no fashion
social network out there.

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,060
Well, I would
wholly disagree.

00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,150
And I'm sorry.
I was an Instagram investor.

00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,160
Yeah.
I've watched that network
grow up from the beginning.

00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,020
Right.
It <i>is</i> the fashion
social network right now.

00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,050
And so, I have friends
like Sophia Bush...

00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,130
-Right.
-...famous TV star.

00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:24,060
Right.
She gets paid directly
by the brands...

00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,150
-Okay.
-...to model their stuff,

00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,050
to integrate it, to mention it
in the mentions, right?
Okay.

00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,110
She's making
so much money doing it

00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,140
that she's not gonna bring that
traffic over here to your app.

00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,200
But are her fans happy
with going to her page

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,120
and seeing her in a
dress and going, "Oh,
who makes that dress,"

00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,100
and then they can't directly
tag it and buy it?

00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,290
'Cause it's annoying.

00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:43,100
Look, I disagree
with Chris.

00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,040
I think a Sophia Bush,
Michelle Phan, whoever it is,

00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,160
is going to go
where the people are.

00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:52,010
But you haven't answered
the most important question --

00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,120
How are you gonna compel them
to use you?

00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,100
Just going
and getting P.R.,

00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,050
just going and spending
marketing dollars...
Right.

00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,090
...is not gonna do it.

00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:03,210
But because you haven't answered
that question, I'm out.

00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,010
Okay.

00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,090
Um, So...
-For me,

00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,150
I think you have
some challenges.

00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,130
I don't think the highest-end,
most influential people

00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:12,030
are gonna come here
because they can do better

00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,100
just doing stuff direct.

00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,000
I mean, you're going
after the Holy Grail.

00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,090
Since the days
I worked at Google,

00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,080
everyone has said,
"Wouldn't it be amazing

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,020
to touch a button
on your TV remote

00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,110
and be able
to buy the sweater

00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,140
that Jennifer Aniston is wearing
in 'Friends'?"

00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,100
-Right.
-Everyone's been chasing this.

00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,070
I've seen a lot of swings
and misses on it.

00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:31,100
You're getting closer, but
I think you also underestimate

00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,120
how much work it's going to take
to do the deals.

00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,090
-Right.
-And for that reason, I'm out.

00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,010
Okay.
Thank you.

00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,060
Amy, I see Godzilla.

00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,140
I see you.

00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,090
And I see you very flat
and a stain on the carpet.
[ Laughs ]

00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,030
-Okay.
-I wish you the best,

00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:48,290
but I see bad things
are gonna happen to you.

00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,290
-Wow.
-I'm out.

00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,010
[ Sighs ]
Okay.

00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,030
Well, Amy, you know, I --

00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,080
You come out here.
You're the real deal.

00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,080
-Thank you.
-That's right.

00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,240
You're hip.
I love fashion.

00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,090
Thank you.

00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,120
I would love
to work with you,

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,170
but I just believe that
the Instagrams of the world,

00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:07,040
they're gonna create some form
that you can buy directly

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,060
just like this.

00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,030
And I just think
it's a little too complicated.

00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,260
And for that reason,
I'm out.

00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,210
Thank you.

00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,250
And then,
there was one.

00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,070
Come on, Barb.

00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,220
You're ready.

00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:22,070
I should probably be listening
to the technology gurus here,

00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,090
but I'm gonna ignore them.

00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,220
Are you making an offer?

00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,080
Narrator:
Four Sharks are out.

00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,130
Barbara is Amy's last chance
for a deal

00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,290
for her social-media fashion app
FashionTap.

00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,170
Okay, Barbara.

00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:44,020
You know, I'm thinking
of another entrepreneur

00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,270
that I invested in
named Grace and Lace.

00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,060
-Uh-huh.
-The woman who owned

00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,040
the business made
lacy boot cuffs

00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,020
for the top of her boots.

00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,120
It seemed like a long shot.

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,060
But ironically,
after all the investments

00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:59,010
I've done in the seven years
on "Shark Tank,"

00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,020
they have been
the most profitable.

00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,100
And there's
something about you

00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,250
that reminds me
so much of Grace and Lace.

00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,080
And so --
Wait, Barbara,
I hear Godzilla.

00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,140
-Yeah.
-I hear him outside.

00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,290
Mind your own business,
if you don't mind, "Mr. Baldy."

00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:14,050
I'm gonna make you
an offer,

00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,270
but I need more
for the $100,000.

00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,240
I need 25%.

00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,090
Okay.

00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:24,000
So, Barbara's made you
a very generous,

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,050
blood-sucking offer.

00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,110
I have total confidence
in you.

00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,080
O'Leary: Take it.
My goodness, what a chance.

00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,210
You have escaped a giant foot
that will crush you

00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:33,030
and make you a small,
yellow, flat pancake.
And don't even pay attention

00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,030
to this guy.
-[ Sighs ]

00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,180
That's coming.

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,020
I'm gonna have
to politely decline.

00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,280
-I just can't.
-Whoa.

00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,180
Do you have a counter offer?

00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:49,040
I really wanted to just go
with the $100,000 for 10%.

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,060
-Wow, no flexibility.
-That's non-negotiable.

00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,090
-Mm.
-Non-negotiable?

00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:54,140
-No, because I also have a team.
-No flexibility?

00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:57,090
"Shark Tank" platform.
Tens of millions of users.
[ Laughs nervously ]

00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,130
You're walking out
without a deal?

00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:00,110
You're not gonna give her
a counter at all?

00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,060
-Okay.
-Amy, it's unusual that

00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,100
an entrepreneur comes in
and sets their price

00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,080
and it's totally non-negotiable.
-Right.

00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,090
It's kind of the equivalent

00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,170
of slamming a door
in someone's face.

00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,250
-You can always make a counter.
-Well, I mean, if you think of

00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,100
other apps, pre--

00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,220
-Revenue?
-You know, users, pre-making --

00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,040
Their valuations are
$1.5 million to $5 million.
Yeah, and a lot of apps --

00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,020
A lot of app creators are
working in Payless Shoes

00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,100
right now 'cause
it didn't work out, so...

00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,190
O'Leary: Amy, you understand
the difference.

00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:26,210
You haven't proven
the monetization of
the business plan yet.

00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:27,210
I'm out.

00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,000
Okay, thank you.
O'Leary: Wow.
Cuban: Good luck, Amy.

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,160
Goodbye, yellow pancake.

00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,200
Thank you.
[ Chuckles ]
Sacca: Good luck.

00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,070
-I thought she'd counter.
-You just dodged a bullet.

00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,040
Roiland:
I came to "Shark Tank" knowing

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,100
exactly what I wanted,

00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,190
and, you know,
they didn't give me that.

00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:46,070
But I am very, very excited
about my app and the future,

00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,250
and I'm not gonna stop.

00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,120
Narrator: In season 6,
Nayeem Hussain

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,060
and Ryan Fant made a deal
with Robert Herjavec

00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,020
for their smart heating-
and-cooling vent Keen Home.

00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,220
Let's see
what they're up to now.

00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,160
Hussain: When we first pitched
the Sharks,

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,290
our product was eight months
away from completion,

00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,020
and we had no sales.

00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,000
Luckily, Robert saw
our vision and invested.

00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,090
The smart vent is
a technology

00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,100
that allows people
to zone their heating

00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,120
and cooling systems
on a room-by-room level.

00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,070
This not only makes people
more comfortable,

00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,110
but it saves them
a lot of money.

00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:20,290
Hey, looks like this Nest Pro
deal is moving forward.

00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,290
Great, man.

00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:23,040
Since making our deal,

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,240
we've done
over $1.6 million in sales.

00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,090
Hey, guys.

00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,280
-Hey, Robert. Welcome!
-Wow!

00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,200
-Good to see you
-How you doing?

00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,120
Herjavec: I'm in New York City
to meet with the Keen Home guys.

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,080
It's interesting --
When they came on the show,

00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,120
The other foolish Sharks saw
them as a vent product.

00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,100
This is not a vent company.
This is a tech company.

00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,120
So, this is
a finished product that we have,

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,180
and I can show you
our app.

00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,110
So cool.

00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:48,020
I hear we have a new product.
I'm anxious to check it out.

00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,120
FANT: So, Robert, this is
our new product.

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,040
This is
the Keen Home smart filter.

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,060
Herjavec: Wow. Very cool.
How does it work?

00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:57,060
So, it enables you to purify air
on a room-by-room level.

00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,080
So, it clicks in
to our existing faceplates.

00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,100
Mind blown.
Purifying airflow is
phenomenal, right?

00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,030
Because you have a huge
indoor-air-quality issue.

00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,120
But what if you could
odor neutralization to that?

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,290
What if you could add
fragrance diffusion to that?

00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,260
I love it.
You guys are on fire.

00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,140
Let's keep it going.

Herjavec: The future is

00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:16,130
I believed in them
when I saw them in the Tank.

00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:19,080
Today, they've expanded
even beyond my vision,

00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,000
and I'm very optimistic.

Narrator: Next up is a business
that wants to make sure

00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,240
you never get caught
in the rain.

00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,040
Hi, Sharks.
I'm John O'Connor.

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,100
And I'm
Anusha Kambhampaty.

00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,130
And we're here seeking
$400,000

00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:54,120
in exchange for 20%
of our company 'Brellabox.

00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,100
What do you do
when a rain storm hits?

00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,060
You scramble
to find shelter

00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,030
or maybe attempt to shield
yourself with your jacket.

00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,130
Or worse yet,
you buy a low-quality umbrella

00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:06,080
from a street vendor,
which quickly breaks

00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,140
and ends up
in the trash.

00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,290
Because we all know
what happens to a cheap umbrella

00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:11,110
in a wind storm.

00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,130
In fact, every year,
worldwide, we throw away

00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:17,000
enough umbrellas
to build 25 Eiffel Towers.

00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,090
What if you could simply rent
an umbrella?

00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,030
'Brellabox makes
that possible.

00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,030
Cuban: [ Laughs ]

00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,170
-Oh, wow.
-No!

00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:26,090
Kambhampaty: Imagine
'Brellabox located strategically

00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:29,030
throughout the city
in places like restaurants,

00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:32,080
hotels, your apartment building,
your office building,

00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,240
even the subway system.

00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,090
Here's how it works.

00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:36,100
Using a credit
or a debit card,

00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,090
for a small fee, you can rent
a high-quality umbrella.

00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:42,040
You enter your e-mail address
or your phone number

00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,100
so that 'Brellabox can
remind you

00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,020
when your umbrella's due back,
and when the sun comes out,

00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,080
you return it
to the nearest machine,

00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,280
which could be found
using our app.

00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,170
There's no more waste.

00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,290
There's no more hassle
of having to lug around

00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,190
an umbrella just in case.

00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:56,050
So, Sharks, who wants to set
aside some money for a rainy day

00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,070
and partner with us?

00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,290
John: How much is it
to rent the umbrella?

00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,160
It's $1.50
for 12 hours, right?

00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,050
So, we've been contacted
by over 23 universities.

00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,110
How? How did they
find out about you?

00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,140
Kambhampaty: We had a lot
of press coverage.

00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,150
We were in
<i>The Wall Street Journal.</i>

00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,030
We got a mention
in <i>The New York Times.</i>

00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,090
There you go.
Okay.

00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:12,080
A lot of people just gravitate
towards this idea.

00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,160
Especially in New York
or other walking cities,

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,290
people know what it's like
to get caught in a rain storm.

00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,120
They buy
a street-vendor umbrella.

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,090
It breaks.
The cycle continues.

00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,180
There's a reason
why the street vendors show up

00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,290
selling the cheap umbrellas
the minute it starts raining.

00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,040
So give us the numbers.

00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,060
We have 85% to us,
15% to the university.

00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,120
And we bring in
a third-party sponsor

00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,130
to put their sponsorship
on the machines.

00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,280
So, you can put
the brand name of a sponsor

00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,040
on the front
of the machine.

00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,090
All of the umbrellas can be
branded for a sponsor.

00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:43,010
It's very similar to Citibike,
which is in New York.
Messaging.

00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,080
Are any in action
right now?

00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,170
Do you have
these placed anywhere?

00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,050
So, we've been
iterating on the machine.
We put one in WeWork.

-[ Groans ]
-What does that mean?

00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,160
That means they're pre-revenue.
[ Chuckles ]

00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,070
We put one in WeWork
in the financial district

00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,080
in New York City.

00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,060
We did a pilot test run
with one box.

00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,120
It rain?
Was there demand?

00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,120
So, there were 16 rainy days
in New York City

00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,050
during the three months
that we did our pilot program.

00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:04,070
On a rainy day,
25 people came through

00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:06,050
and used --
-What was the price?

00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,080
So, the price was free
at WeWork.

00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,050
And if you didn't return
the umbrella,

00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,040
what was the charge?

00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,070
$40.

00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:15,110
Have you invested any money
in this yet?
Yes.

00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,140
Can we have a moment of silence
for that dead money?
[ Laughter ]

00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,090
Mr. Wonderful,
as much as you love money,

00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:20,150
you should listen
to an opportunity

00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:23,030
to make some money with this.
-It's so important for me...

00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,140
-I'm telling you.
-You're so lucky you met me

00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,250
because I will stop
this madness now.

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,050
This is maybe the worst idea
I've ever heard on "Shark Tank."

00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,290
-The marketplace dis--
-It could be.

00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,000
It is hideous.

00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,020
And I don't want you
to waste your lives.

00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,050
-Wow.
-I'm out.

00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,110
What do you do when you get
stuck in the rain?

00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,230
Are you out of your mind? I pick
up an umbrella for $4.99...

00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:41,080
Get him.
Get him, Anusha.
...and I throw it out
when it's over.

00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,210
He melts.
That's what happens.

00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,100
What does it cost you --

00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,110
Eleven-fifty to make this
in a limited run

00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,240
of 50 machines in Kansas.
-Eleven --

00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,040
-$1,150.
-Okay.

00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,070
We can get this
down to $975 for 200.

00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,000
-Let's just say $1,000.
-Okay, let's say $1,000.

00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,020
Is that
with the umbrellas or no?

00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,050
We've never paid
for an umbrella.

00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,100
The largest
umbrella manufacturer has been

00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,250
giving us umbrellas
for free.

00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,130
Okay, well, that's good.

00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,140
Why would they be giving you
the umbrellas for free?

00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,060
Because if you can put
your umbrella in 'Brellabox

00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,150
and it withstands the rigor
of being a rental umbrella,

00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:10,110
that is consistent
with the brand messaging

00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:13,120
that a lot of these large
manufacturers want to have.

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,260
You don't think there's
a conversion process there?

00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,130
It's raining outside.

00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,080
Like, "Wow, I now have
to put my credit card in.

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,090
I'm tired."
I just don't --

00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,210
I don't do it --
the process.

00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:22,290
But remember, you're doing it
in the rain, as well.
And do it in the rain.

00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:25,210
And, Daymond, don't forget you
have to return the umbrella.
O'Connor: These are
indoor machines.

00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:28,030
You have to return it.
Cuban: See, I look at it
completely different.

00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,070
Where am I gonna return
the umbrella to, as well?

00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,070
Why can't you tell
the truth?

00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,130
It's a horrendously
crappy idea.

00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:34,000
Yeah, but if I return it --
Why are you yelling at me?

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,150
It's not my company.
Because I'm just worried

00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,200
about you guys.
I'm worried about you.
[ Laughs ]

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,080
Why waste your lives
on such a crappy idea?
O'Connor: Look, look,
we're a real start-up.

00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,170
We're used to the taste
of blood in our mouth.

00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:45,060
You're not the first person
that's criticized this.
Oh, it sucks!

00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,190
You're not the first person
that's criticized this idea.

00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,200
The marketplace is
saying something --
Really? I wonder why!

00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,210
You know what,
Mr. Wonderful doesn't worry
about his hair getting wet.

00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:53,020
The rest of us understand
that problem a little bit.
It's horrendous.

00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,100
Okay, Chris, step up.
Fund this thing.

00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,170
I'll step up and tell you,
look, I live in California.

00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,140
I'm sure we won't see rain again
for another five years.

00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:04,030
Plus, these shirts are
so full of polyester

00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,040
and rayon that
they're essentially

00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,110
a waterproof raincoat
at this point.

00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:10,090
And so I haven't suffered from
this problem in a long time.

00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,060
So for these reasons,
I'm out.

00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,120
-Okay.
-Okay.

00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,120
Have you actually taken
an order from anyone?
Yes.

00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,190
And what is it?
We have an order
from Michigan State University

00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:21,080
at their law school --
for one unit.
For how many units?

00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,040
We're finalizing
our contracts

00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,010
with East Stroudsburg
University.

00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,060
Four bo--
-How many?

00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:29,120
Four box pilot.
Ultimately, 20 rollout.

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,050
Are your umbrellas better,
by the way?

00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:34,090
Yes, these umbrellas are
phenomenal quality.

00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,050
Mr. Wonderful, would you like
to see an umbrella?

00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,130
-Let me see.
-Sure, show me the umbrella,

00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,030
but it doesn't change
the outcome.

00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,100
Corcoran: You want to know
what I think?

00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,090
I think the umbrellas are
too nice because when I buy

00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,280
those cheap umbrellas, I'm
throwing them in the garbage.

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,160
This is, like, a very heavy,
well-made umbrella.
Yeah, but that's the problem.
You're throwing it away.

00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,160
And if you decide to keep it,
they make 40 bucks,

00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,160
and it costs you nothing,
right?
Great. They got your credit
card. You can buy it.

00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:55,100
But it's a lot of money
for a little bit of the company

00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,080
with a lot of uncertainty.

00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,130
I don't think it's a bad idea.
I think Kevin's wrong.

00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:02,060
No, he's right.
It's <i>horrific.</i>
I think there's
opportunity, but --

00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,140
-We believe deeply in it.
-Say it, Mark.

00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,080
-We believe deeply.
-Bring it out, big boy.

00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,190
I believe deeply
in this business.
I'm out.

00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:10,080
Okay.

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,110
The problem with the idea is
for it to have

00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:16,080
any legs to stand on,
you need a lot of boxes.

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,090
And for every box
you put on the street,

00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:21,160
by the hotel,
in Wall Street, on a campus,

00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,150
you got to shell out
1,000 bucks of your own money

00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:27,070
before you get
any revenue sharing going.

00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:29,060
And then, you're sharing
the upside with the university.

00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,130
Well, that's
where the sponsor comes in.

00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,140
If a sponsor comes in --
Yeah, but it's
not arranged yet,

00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,050
and that's
another whole layer of work.

00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:37,070
I just don't think
it makes any sense

00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,020
no matter
how you look at it.

00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:42,120
Yeah.
I'm sorry to say I'm out.

00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,050
-Daymond, please.
-Am I the last one in?

00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,260
Give them $400,000.

00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,130
I just don't want
to be disrespectful

00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:51,140
towards the fact
that they want to work hard

00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,170
and create this,
but it's not an everyday item.

00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:56,150
I mean, maybe you need
to find a box that puts
something in there

00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:59,250
that people need every single
day on the streets of New York.

00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,060
So I'm out.

00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,090
All right, guys.
Thanks a lot.

00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,250
Yep, all right.
-Thank you.

00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,260
Good luck.

00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:12,100
Is that the worst idea
you have ever seen in your life?
No.

00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,000
It's evil!
It's evil!

00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,020
It's so bad.

00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,150
You're gonna have
a whole cult of people

00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,290
posting wet pictures of you
on the Internet now.
[ Laughter ]

00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,020
Narrator: Next up is
a product designed

00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,170
to get kids to eat healthier.

00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,260
Cute kids.

00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,290
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Bob Ntoya.

00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:49,000
And I'm Adam Gerber.

00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
And we're
from Altadena, California,

00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,030
and our company is
My Fruity Faces.

00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,140
We're seeking $200,000

00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,290
in exchange
for 10% of our company.

00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:00,050
My Fruity Faces has invented
the --

00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:03,180
My Fruity Faces
has invented...

00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:06,110
the stick, uh, uh...
-"The solution."

00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:09,060
the solution
that families are having,

00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,100
or parents are having

00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,060
in trying to get their children
to eat healthier.

00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:15,040
Gerber: Like most parents,
my wife and I spend

00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,100
a lot of time
and energy planning

00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,290
and preparing
healthy snacks

00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:21,030
and healthy lunches
for our kids.

00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,160
And what do we find
when they return home?

00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,070
Hot bags of brown,
steamy, rotten mush screaming

00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,280
to be thrown away.

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,270
What a waste.

00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,240
Well, Sharks,
not anymore.

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,190
Say it again.

00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:34,090
Thanks
to My Fruity Faces --
Say, "Well, Sharks,
not anymore."

00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:36,090
What?
Say, "Well, Sharks,
not anymore."
[ Laughter ]

00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:38,250
Well, Sharks,
not anymore.

00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,160
Zing!

00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,130
Thanks to My Fruity Faces,
the all-natural, edible stickers

00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:46,070
that makes eating fresh fruits
and vegetables fun and exciting.

00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:49,150
We've used magical ingredients
mixed with fruity science

00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:53,000
to create an all-natural,
safe, edible sticker.

00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,020
You just peel it,
stick it, and enjoy.

00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:00,280
So, Sharks, help us take
a bite out of healthy --

00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,220
<i>unhealthy</i> snack time.

00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,270
First of all,
I'd like to thank the kids.

00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,160
Thanks, kids.

00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,090
Corcoran: They didn't want
to eat their fruit.

00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,250
See you, guys.
Nice hat.

00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,070
[Laughs] Aww, he's so cute.
Look at him.

00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:15,190
So, now we'd like to show you
our edible stickers.

00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,280
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,100
-Hey, Daymond.
-Hi.

00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:26,090
So, now, I put this
on a piece of fruit like this.

00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:27,270
And then,
you eat it, yes.

00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,100
Mmm.
Pretty good.

00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,160
It's basically
tapioca starch.

00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,070
Okay, you're selling
a lot of this, right,

00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,290
'cause you put a $2 million
valuation on this company.

00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:42,020
-Correct.
-So, how are sales?

00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,070
So, we've had
$125,000 worth of sales

00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,000
in the first three years.

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,050
-Whoa.
-Three years?!

00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,090
-Three years.
-Three years?

00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:50,290
-Yeah.
-What did you sell last month?

00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,220
We sold about $2,000
last month.

00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:55,070
Dollars?
Cuban: Ohh, guys.
Yes, and let me explain.
Let me explain.

00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,160
Here's what's happening.
-You should explain.

00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,140
Okay, we landed Walmart
about a year and a half ago.

00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:03,030
We did our test in 2014.
It went extremely well.

00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:05,090
And we're gonna be going
into 3,600 stores.

00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:07,120
So far, I'm excited.
What happens next?

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,060
So now we just need capital
to basically move forward

00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,100
for inventory.

00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,140
But this is real time?
This is right now?
Yes.

00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,070
Wait a minute.
You have orders --

00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,060
purchase orders --
Or do you have --

00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,160
Or you just became
an approved vendor,

00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:22,040
and they're discussing
with you rolling you out,

00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,140
testing you,
in all doors?

00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,160
The contract basically says
we're a vendor

00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,220
and that we can go
into 3,600 stores.
Ohh!

00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,180
Did they give you
a purchase order?
No, no, no.
That's not the same.

00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:32,000
They haven't given us
a purchase order, but let me --

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,030
[ Both groan loudly ]

00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,160
I can get the purchase order
and get --

00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:38,110
We're actually dealing with
the head of produce in Walmart.

00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,090
And our discussion
basically was we were looking

00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:43,010
for the price point
to go ahead and figure out

00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:46,010
whether it's $1.99
or $1.49.

00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:48,050
Gerber: We actually did
a test last year.

00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:49,180
The sales went great.
Everything went well.

00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:53,030
What was
the percentage of sales?
78% sell-through.

00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,140
Are you working
with any other stores,

00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:57,140
or is this the one big store
you've put all your eggs

00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:00,080
in that particular basket?
No, we're actually talking
with Target.

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,020
We're talking
with SuperValu.

00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,070
We were talking
to Whole Foods.

00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,150
-But just early-stage talking?
-Early-stage talking.

00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:07,180
And just to add to that,
Sharks, one of the things

00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:10,100
that we realized is if we can do
the licensed products --

00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,020
And we've been
with Nickelodeon.

00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,140
We actually had
a Nickelodeon license.

00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,100
We realized with the licensing,
the numbers just shot up.

00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,130
And how much
have you guys invested in this?

00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:21,070
Altogether, we've raised
about $482,000.

00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:23,140
-No!
-Ohh! Ohh.

00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,150
O'Leary: Now, you have
to have some losses here

00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:27,110
because you've invested
almost $500,000.

00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:29,080
Sales were $2,000
last month.

00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,080
Do you have debt
on this company?

00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,030
Yeah, we do --
$177,000.

00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,080
-Ooh!
-Ohh!

00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,050
So, you're in
for $660,000, basically.

00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:38,000
-Yeah, $600,000.
-Yowza, kiddies.

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,140
John: Are you
the sole investors?

00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:42,150
No, we actually have 12 other --
10 other investors.

00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:46,040
What percentage
of the company do you own,

00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,060
each one of you?

00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,110
18% and 17.5%.

00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:51,070
Corcoran: Can I clear
the deck a little bit?

00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,100
The way I see it is

00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:56,140
you had $125,000 in sales
over three years.

00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,010
I just can't imagine
investing my money

00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:01,040
and thinking
I'd really get it back out.

00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,000
so I'm sad
to say I'm out.

00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,040
Okay, thank you.

00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,040
And one of the things
that I wanted to add is

00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,160
we're actually partnering up
with Dole.

00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,040
So we've realized there's
a tremendous opportunity for us.

00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,280
I kid you not.
-Yeah, but, guys, you made

00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,030
the cardinal mistake
of thinking

00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,270
that money was gonna get
you there quicker.

00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,140
You didn't do
many sales.

00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,110
You should have taken
the small amount

00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:22,020
of stickers you had
and hit every single school

00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:25,020
you could hit,
hit every street fair,

00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,050
farmer's market,
sold 10,000, 20,000,

00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:29,050
50,000, have
a proven concept.

00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:31,130
And you just made the cardinal
mistake as an entrepreneur.

00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:34,010
And now you're suffering
from it.

00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,160
I'm out.

00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:40,000
How much cash do you have
in the bank right now?

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,280
We have about $4,000.

00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,000
$40,000 -- four-oh?

00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
-$4,000.
-$4,000.

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,030
-$4,000.
-$4,000.

00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,120
-Whoa.
-Guys, Daymond hit

00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,070
the nail
on the head, right?

00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:51,230
When your back is
against the wall, you sell.

00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,120
Sales cures all.

00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,220
How much do you have
in inventory right now?

00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,070
$64,000.

00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:57,080
$64,000 of product.

00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,020
You know, if you sell them
for 2 bucks a pop,

00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:03,070
that's $150,000 almost
in retail, right?

00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:05,110
So that's just
a matter of your efforts.

00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,090
Your effort is
the one thing standing

00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:11,010
between you
with $4,000 in the bank

00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:14,070
and $100,000-plus
in cash.

00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:18,050
Guys, I don't think you should
invest more money in this.

00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,040
I'm out.

00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,060
-Okay, thank you.
-Thank you.

00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,230
Sacca: Hey, look,
I admire your hustle.

00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:25,030
I admire your drive.

00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:27,070
I do absolutely believe
that my kids would eat

00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:30,120
more of these things
if they had faces on them.

00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,010
The problem is
you don't benefit

00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:34,170
as a result
of my kids getting healthier.

00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:37,110
You sleep better at night
and the world is a better place,

00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:40,060
but it doesn't roll up to the
balance sheet of the company.

00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,150
You're out of money.
You got $4,000 left.

00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:44,100
You've got your backs
against the wall.

00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,080
You're asking for $200,000,
and all that would be enough

00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,020
to do is pay off your
existing debt on the business.

00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,060
It doesn't
actually leave you

00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,280
with a lot
of working capital here.

00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,060
Too many things have
to go right.

00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,220
And so far, they're not.
They're going wrong.

00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,060
I'm out.

00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:01,000
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Chris.

00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,120
I've been fighting
all my life.

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,040
I know
that we can make it happen.

00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,170
I see all the challenges,
and that's why we're here.

00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:10,040
If I didn't believe in what
I was doing, I know that --

00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,270
Belief is not enough.

00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,230
Mark, what
are you gonna do?

00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,140
I like the idea.

00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:21,040
I like the concept
of licensed characters.

00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,050
What do you have
in inventory.

00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:23,090
-Nickelodeon.
-We have our Nickelodeon.

00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:25,040
And you're allowed
to sell it?

00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,040
Not anymore.

00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,240
We're looking
to renew our license.

00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:33,020
Something's not right.

00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,140
It's not the idea.
It's not the concept.

00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:38,020
It is the execution
100% of the way.

00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,050
Something's wrong.

00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,020
And because I have no clue
what that is

00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:44,080
and I don't want to be
the one to fix it, I'm out.

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,130
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Sharks.

00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:47,060
-Good luck, guys.
-Thank you very much.

00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,230
-Good luck.
-Good luck, guys.

00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,010
Thank you.

00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,110
Gerber:
We have a great product.

00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:53,090
We have a great contract
for distribution.

00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,080
We have great licensing.

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,090
We have a lot of things
in place.

00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:57,270
And the fact
that they couldn't see that is

00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:59,230
extremely frustrating.

00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,010
My name's Dave Vasen.

00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,110
I live in San Francisco,
California,

00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:15,000
with my wife, Simona,
and my daughter, Serena.
Whee!

00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,090
I'm a first-generation American.

00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:18,020
My parents came to the U.S.
from South America

00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,070
with almost nothing.

00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:21,020
They taught me the importance
of a strong work ethic

00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,020
and the value of an education.

00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,110
How are we looking
to get this out today?

00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:27,010
Vasen: After school, I started
working in education technology,

00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:28,060
building software platforms

00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,090
for big companies like Amazon
and Cisco.

00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:33,020
But when my daughter, Serena,
was born, everything changed.

00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,050
Hi!
Come, run!

00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:35,140
Vasen: I would leave
for work every day,

00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,290
and I just found it so hard
to not be a part of her day

00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,060
and how she was learning
and growing.

00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,050
I knew with my background
and passion for education,

00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,090
I could actually do
something about it.

00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:44,080
Everybody,
say, "Cheese!"

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,120
Vasen: I developed
a unique product

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,130
that's focused specifically
on early education.

00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,120
It connects preschool
and day-care teachers

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,060
to parents
and their children

00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,030
in a way that's
never been done before.

00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,290
85% of brain development happens

00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,200
in the first three years
of life,

00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,100
and every study shows that
the investment that you make has

00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,090
a massive impact
not only on the individual

00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,150
but on the greater community.

00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:03,060
These are our kids.
This is our future.

00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,160
And this is something
that we have to invest in.

00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,060
Hi, Sharks.
My name's Dave Vasen.

00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,130
I'm the founder
and C.E.O. of brightwheel.

00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:27,140
I'm here seeking
a $400,000 investment

00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:31,020
for a 4% equity stake
in my company.
[ Groans ]

00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,090
brightwheel is the mobile app

00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:35,040
for preschools,
day cares, and families.

00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,090
And we are completely
revolutionizing early education.

00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:39,070
Now, I believe
all of us are parents here,

00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,170
and I want to ask,
when you come home

00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:43,080
after a long day and you ask
your kids, "What did you learn

00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,060
in school today,"
does this sound familiar?

00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:48,220
Girl: <i>I did everything.</i>

00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,280
<i>I did...</i>

00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,020
<i>I don't want to tell you.</i>

00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,010
-[ Laughs ]
<i>-You don't want to tell me?</i>

00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:55,100
<i>-I don't know!</i>
-[ Laughs ]

00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,200
Vasen: All right,
this is the experience

00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,060
for millions of parents
across America every single day

00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,030
and especially for younger kids.

00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,120
You've been apart
from your little human being

00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,140
for 6, 8, 10 hours a day,
and that is all you get.

00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,070
You know, you want to be
a part of their day.

00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,030
You want to add to their
learning once you come home.

00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:11,140
And you can't.
And it's gut-wrenching.

00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:14,050
And on the other side, on
the school side, it's no better.

00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:16,070
In addition
to actually educating our kids,

00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:18,170
teachers are managing
a ton of paperwork.

00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:21,040
Let's face it -- They're
actually managing parents.

00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,090
And on top of that,
they're even running a business.

00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:26,120
The system is broken,
and brightwheel is the solution.

00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,040
So, let's jump in and take
a look at how brightwheel works.

00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,050
So, with brightwheel,
teachers can easily check

00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,110
kids in from the mobile app.

00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:35,280
They can log activities
and assessments during the day.

00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,130
They can send quick updates.

00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:41,070
And they can even manage
their business all in one place.

00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,040
And we're just seeing
an amazing amount of photos

00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,000
every single day
on brightwheel.

00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,040
And this is the reason.

00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,060
You take it, you tag it,
and you are absolutely done.

00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,050
And now we're gonna look
at the teacher app.

00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:52,090
So, this is the teacher's room.

00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:54,090
And we're gonna click on
"activities" at the bottom here.

00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,080
And this is all being done
on paper today.

00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,010
So, we've taken it
and combined it

00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:59,120
and made it super-fast
and super-easy.

00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,030
And so we're gonna click
on "nap" here,

00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:04,010
and then we're gonna tag
three kids

00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,110
that just went down
for a nap.

00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:08,060
And the key about brightwheel is
we're saving teachers time.

00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,270
You actually have
measurably more time

00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,200
with kids
every single day.

00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,000
Now we're gonna flip over real
quick to the parent experience.

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,070
So let's jump to the mobile app.

00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:18,020
This is actually my little girl,
Serena, and this is her day.

00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,020
And as you can see,
I get a sense of not only

00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,140
what she's doing
but what she's learning.

00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:24,000
And so, when I come home,
I can actually have

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,110
a conversation with her
about it.

00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,040
My connection
with my little girl is

00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,050
so much deeper
because of brightwheel.

00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:31,010
And by the way, in the middle
of a pretty tough day,

00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,260
it doesn't hurt
to get a photo like this.

00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,120
[ Chuckles ]

00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,060
Sharks, this is
a unique opportunity

00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,090
to build a massive business
that has a massive impact

00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,120
on people's everyday lives,

00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,100
and that's something
that we hear every day.

00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,070
So, I hope you'll join Serena
and our team

00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:44,030
in bringing brightwheel
to every preschool,

00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:46,250
every day care, and every family
across the globe.

00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,100
Are you selling me
this platform, this dashboard?

00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,000
Is that what's happening?
-Yes.

00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,020
How much am I paying for it?

00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,040
Right now,
you're paying nothing.

00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,130
brightwheel's free today.

00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:56,040
When we have
our premium product,

00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,290
you will be paying
a monthly fee for that.

00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:59,050
The parent will pay,
or I'll pay?

00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:01,020
You will pay as
the administrator or the owner.

00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,090
And will the parent
ever pay anything?

00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:03,290
Not today.
We're building a platform.

00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:05,010
We see a lot of opportunity

00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,040
to add value to parents
down the road.

00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,070
Except you can't advertise
on that platform.

00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,170
Correct, and we have
no intention to advertise.

00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:11,130
Wait, you can advertise
to the parents all you want.

00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,210
We don't want to. We think
there's a ton of ways --

00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:15,040
-But you can.
-You'll have a very hard
time with that model.

00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,030
No way. No way.

00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,090
No, and we have
no intention to.

00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:19,130
So let me walk you through
what brightwheels look like.

00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,130
So we started with a pilot
in the fall of 2014.

00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:23,060
How many schools
did you get signed up?

00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,080
Yes, so we got 10 schools
in the pilot.

00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,120
Literally, no product.

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,090
And so we worked with them.
We listened to them.

00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,080
We understood their needs.

00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,090
In June of this year,

00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,260
we launched publicly
as brightwheel.

00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,120
We went from 10,

00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,120
and then now
we have 2,500 schools.

00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,160
We're in every state
across the country.

00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,050
Wow.
So, how are you
gonna monetize this?

00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:38,070
First, I just want to say

00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,090
that when you look
at other industries,

00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:40,120
all of these industries

00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,100
have really great
dedicated software

00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,080
that's provided
by very large companies.

00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,050
This is a massive market
that doesn't have that,

00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:47,160
and so that's where
we see ourselves fitting in.

00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,270
Well, a lot of that
has to do with the fact

00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,140
that they don't have money

00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,250
because they're very much
small proprietors.

00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:53,090
But they do have budget.

00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:54,140
Well,
they're just mismanaged.

00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,130
I've got a 4-year-old,
a 2-year-old, and a 2-week-old,

00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,190
and I pull
my hair out sometimes

00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:00,030
looking at how the preschools
are managed as a business.

00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,070
And they -- Right.

00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:03,060
I offered to write software
for my kid's preschool.

00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,150
-Yeah?
-And that's why we love it

00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:06,050
'cause we take all that
off their hands

00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:07,080
so they have more time
with kids.

00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,140
You're doing
so many things at once.

00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:10,090
That makes it a little harder
to pitch this.
Yeah.

00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:12,030
That may be where the
opportunity lies, too, right?

00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,130
You're doing something
for schools,

00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:16,100
something for parents,
something for teachers, as well.

00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,130
Right.
We're in everything

00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:20,160
from four-person
in-home day cares, even --

00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,250
A lot of people are actually
using us with nannies,

00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,120
so single person --

00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,020
all the way up to an elite chain
of preschools.

00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,180
So we're gonna offer
at the low price point

00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:30,140
around $40 per month for
a really small in-home day care,

00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,110
and that scales up
to $200 in terms of the --

00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:34,050
So the top price is $200...
Right.

00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,130
...and that could be
50 kids, right?

00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:36,290
There are some
very large centers,

00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:38,020

with several hundred children.

Yes. Yeah.
Wow.

from investors?

That's the biggest hurdle
we're trying to cross.

00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,170
David, when you're
asking these guys in,

00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:12,070
are you willing to give up
more equity for more money?

00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,110
And that's what
I'm trying to figure out

00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,040
so they can even know
how to position themselves.

00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,070
I would consider it.

00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,290
We came in here
with -- with a concrete ask

00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,010
in terms of a -- of a budget.

00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:20,060
If it means getting more Sharks

00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,050
and -- and having more people
at the table,

00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:23,060
then I would consider it.

00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,070
I'll do it either way.

00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:26,010
I think partnering with Chris
is smart,

00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:27,100
and obviously,
you see the value there.

00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,050
-Right.
-And I don't mind doing that.

00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:31,090
He may not think there's value.
I'll leave that to him.

00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:34,110
Or I'll leave it to you
and say I'll hit your number --

00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:36,150
400k at the price
that you ask.

00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:39,070
-At 4%.
-At the $10 million valuation.

00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,130
Yeah, because
I have enough confidence

00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:41,230
that I add enough value
that it will propel that.
Yeah.

00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,120
So you're willing to do the deal
at $400,000 at 4%?
Either way, but I do.

00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,020
Look, regardless of what
he said about me, right,

00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,000
I see the value there
because I'm --

to teaming up for a deal.

00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:06,280
Is that something
you'd be open to?

What if we do --
So at the valuation

00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,100
that Mark talked about --

00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,140
$300,000 from Mark
and $300,000 from Chris?

We get it done, and we build
this thing together.

We're paying more than
the last guys paid, huh?

00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,000
You're paying 25% more.
At that time, we didn't have --
