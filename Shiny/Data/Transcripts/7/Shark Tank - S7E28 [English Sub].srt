00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,120
People from the arcade
were like, "Oh, my gosh.

00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,130
Could you build this for me?"

00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:10,140
And within a few weeks,
I had, like,

00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,100
an order
for eight pinball machines.

00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,170
And...

00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:17,130
the economy at that point,
in my home-theater business,

00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:18,130
was-- wasn't that great.

00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,140
We're in Cincinnati.

00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,080
The market was still recovering.

00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,170
And, uh,
we had been struggling in --

00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:24,190
in the home-theater business.

00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:28,050
And, uh, we were, uh...
Sorry.

00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,190
We almo--
We almost lost our house.

00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:34,170
Um, and, uh, I was charging,
like,

00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:36,230
$4,000 or $5,000 to make
a machine for somebody.

00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:40,130
And, uh -- And from the money
that I made off those machines,

00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,220
I was able to go my bank

00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,130
a week before
they were gonna foreclose

00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:45,040
and pay my mortgage in cash.

00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,060
Wow.

00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,100
Uh, it saved my family.

00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,220
So, you sold eight machines
to start.

00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,150
What are your total sales
today?

00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:54,170
So, in a year and a half, uh,
we have done...200 units.

00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:57,070
And, uh, close to $750,000.

00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,140
-Whoa.
-How many macho-- Wow.

00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,130
What does one machine cost?

00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:02,110
So, our machines vary
from -- right now,

00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:05,020
from $3,000 to $9,500.

00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,210
-Wow.
-What?

00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:10,180
This machine here retails
for $7,995.

00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:13,120
And we sell this machine 50:1.

00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,130
How are you selling these?

00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:16,160
We do trade shows.
Lots of trade shows.

00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,200
In a two-day trade show,
our best two-day is $100,000.

00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,130
So, Brad, walk us through
your business model.

00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:23,130
Let's -- I understand
you're selling these

00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:25,040
to consumers direct.

00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,375
Yes.

00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:27,230
So I'm assuming a 50% margin
on that at least?

00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:30,080
The way that it works
right now -- uh, for example,

00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,180
our $7,995 machine,

00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:37,040
uh, my bill of materials
on that machine is $2,686.

00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,120
Big question.
Protectable?

00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,170
There is not anybody
that we know of

00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,230
that's anywhere near
what we're doing.

00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:43,220
We've got a really high-end
gaming computer in there

00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:46,260
with video cards,
we use 8 to 16 gigabytes of RAM.

00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:50,130
We custom-cut our own cabinets
on our own CNC machine

00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:53,150
that we designed so that our
displays slide in a certain way.

00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,000
So you guys are
a systems integrator?

00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,421
Yes.

00:35:55,421 --> 00:35:57,070
Are you making a profit
right now?

00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,180
Well, so, for 2014,

00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:01,200
I showed a net profit
of only about 12,000 bucks.

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,260
Wow.
Okay.
What was your gross profit?

00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,210
-Now let's add -- add back in --
-What was your gross profit?

00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:06,230
Gross prof-- profit
was around $70,000.
That's it?

00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,120
So, about 10%.
Yeah. And, you know,
we were --

00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,140
Is there any cost
to the software?

00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,120
We pay a license fee,
uh, for --

00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,140
How much, roughly?

00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,200
I-It's -- It's up to
15% of the sale...

00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,120
-Whoa.
-...of the sale of the game.

00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,210
Okay. So, $2,600,

00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:19,160
plus you pay
a software-licensing fee

00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,200
of another $1,000.

00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,090
You're at $4,000.
You're selling them at $8,000.

00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,110
Retail, yes.

00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:26,210
And we push them at trade shows
for 6,000 bucks.

00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:29,160
Are you taking any cash out
to pay yourself?

00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,200
Uh, I have not paid myself.

00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:34,080
If you pay yourself,
a normalized salary for you

00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,120
of, let's say, 80 grand,

00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,150
this business
isn't profitable yet.

00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:40,220
It -- It is not profitable yet.
I am putting every dime back in.

00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,240
I'm probably buying things
to grow the business

00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,160
that I maybe should have
waited a little longer for.

00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,080
And I believe we have a product
that can scale beyond

00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,130
just your average pinball buyer,

00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:50,250
because a lot of people
are afraid to buy pinballs

00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,240
because of the maintenance
and because it's only one game

00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,200
and their kid's gonna get
bored with it really quick.

00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,080
So, Brad,
I own 10 pinball machines.

00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,140
Fantastic.

00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,160
And you can buy them
for about $4,000 or $5,000,

00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,160
and they feel great.
Yours felt better.

00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,100
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,160
But, Brad,
here's the problem.

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,200
The kids, they didn't get
the same excitement from it

00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,180
as they do with
online games.

00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,260
When we go to trade shows,

00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:15,160
we have lines at our booth, and
kids are all the way around it.

00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,200
Kids aren't gonna buy this.

00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,180
You're gonna sell it
to old guys like me

00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,220
who like pinball
because it's cooler.

00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,220
Parents are buying this
for their kids nonstop.

00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:25,260
For me -- clever idea.
Great idea.

00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:29,160
I'm glad that it helped you
get out of a difficult position.

00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,200
Baker: Sure, sure.

00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:34,030
But for kids, 'cause
they all have little devices

00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,100
with thousands of games,

00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,130
and they can hold it
and carry with them.

00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,230
And so I don't think
they care about

00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:41,210
the huge, big, interactive
experience all the time.

00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:44,180
I don't see this
scaling really huge

00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:48,130
because there's just so much out
there in gaming people can do,

00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:49,150
and so easily.

00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,170
Digital pinball is
the future of pinball.

00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:52,060
It's changing
the pinball market.

00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:52,448
And for that reason, I'm out.

00:37:52,448 --> 00:37:56,070
And w-- Thank you.
Thanks for your time, Lori.

00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,050
I have to bring reality
to all your enthusiasm, okay?

00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:01,458
Thank you.
[ Chuckles ]

00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:05,130
It is not worth $2 million.
It's nowhere near that.

00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,200
I respectfully disagree
with you.

00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,130
It's a break-even business
right now.

00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:10,190
You really have no way
of paying me back.

00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:14,130
I hope you can continue
to sell them one at a time,

00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:15,160
but it's not investable.

00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,060
Uh,
I appreciate your input.

00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,040
I'm out.
Thank you.

00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,100
First of all, the guy's been in
business for a year and a half.

00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,170
You're building
the business.

00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:26,120
Who cares what the profitability
is at this point,

00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,140
and who cares what
it's worth?

00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,210
Nothing proprietary at all.
That's not true.

00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:30,170
Baker: I believe we will be able
to get some patents.

00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:32,020
Zero.
Here's the challenge.

00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:32,378
Absolutely nothing.

00:38:32,378 --> 00:38:34,190
Here's the challenge
with the business.

00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:38,150
You don't make the most vital
component of it the software.

00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,210
I'd love to get there.

00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:43,140
Tell me, how are you gonna
go from 200 machines to 400?

00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,120
We want to push trade shows
further out west.

00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,100
I really want to
get into distributors

00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,150
like the stores
we're selling now.

00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,160
They love our machines.

00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,100
We're only in a few stores,
so --

00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,170
And there's a thousand
of these stores.

00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:55,140
Brad, look. I don't think
the kids are gonna buy it.

00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,250
I don't think it's
gonna go that way.

00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:59,080
I wish you would have
come up with a strategy

00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,120
to find guys like me.

00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,140
Can I te-- say one thing?

00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,140
With the commercial side
of this business,

00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,220
what has happened in the past

00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:07,130
is most all of the big
arcades -- Dave &amp; Buster's,

00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:08,130
Chuck E. Cheese,
all the big ones --

00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:09,150
they've gotten rid of pinball

00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,210
because they're
too much maintenance.

00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:12,170
And we have the ability to
get back into those places...

00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:13,170
I don't agree with you.
I don't --

00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,250
...in a big way.
And that's a hu--

00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:17,210
Brad, I don't share your vision
for the commercial side of it.

00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:20,150
This is a high-end,
vintage type of business.

00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,120
I'd really like to do both. I
love what I'm doing here, but --

00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,260
I'm out.

00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:29,000
I'm trying so hard
to find a reason to say yes.

00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,411
All right.
Right.

00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:30,200
Just say it.
Let's do this.

00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,090
Oh, I wish it was
that simple.

00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,110
I disagree with Robert.

00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,080
While you'll sell
to vintage stuff,

00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,120
that's
the low-hanging fruit.

00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,230
But what I see is a platform
for gaming

00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:42,220
that's much more tactical
than using a joystick at home.

00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,120
-A platform? A --
-Let's bring on a programmer

00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,160
and make our own games.

00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,080
Well, but see, but that's part
of the problem. Right.

00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,130
You got to be kidding me.

00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:50,080
Kids are gonna walk up to
this thing and play it?

00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,120
Like crazy.
Every show, like nuts.

00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,050
You know, that's the difference
between us, Robert.

00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:53,438
It's huge. It's crazy.

00:39:53,438 --> 00:39:55,180
You see something, and you
can be 1,001, and that's cool.

00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,100
I see something,
and I want to be the first

00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,140
at doing something
to change the game.

00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,160
I'm changing it.

00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,290
But you're not, though,
and that's the problem.

00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:15,120
Narrator:
Three Sharks are out.

00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,150
Mark and Daymond
are Brad's last chances

00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:20,120
for a deal for his
digital-pinball machine company,

00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,210
VPCabs.

00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,180
The direction
you've told me is not it.

00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,210
Your vision is for
a bigger business.

00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:28,200
If you had come in and you had
lots of technical expertise

00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,220
and said, "Here's where we are
as a platform,

00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,120
and here's where
the custom is."

00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,170
But you don't have that.
I would have to do it.

-So, I was raised,

00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:50,120
and I bought a couple
of those games --

00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:53,130

and go out and hit every single
door and things like that...

it wasn't a make-or-break deal,

00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,280

one of those deals

get where we need to be.
