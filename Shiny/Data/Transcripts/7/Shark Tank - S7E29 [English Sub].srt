00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,040
Okay.
Thank you.

Mark, have you decided?

00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,080
Cuban: Look, this is all about
social media.

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,180
Where you go
on social media

00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,020
is gonna make or break
the product.

00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,100
What are you doing there?

00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,110
So, retail and online
is gonna be super important,

00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,090
but I made the decision

00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:56,210
to be strictly focused
on the retail side

00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:00,030
so that I could perfect
the sales pitch,

00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,170
control the sales cycle.

00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,130
I think you made
a strategic mistake

00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,090
in focusing specifically
on retail.

00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,160
This is such
a viral product.

00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,220
This is about "people talking
to each other" type product.

00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:16,070
It's inconceivable to me that
you didn't focus online to sell,

00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,040
particularly
coming into here.

00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,130
And the one big upside

00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:23,050
isn't to drive people into
Equinox gyms in Boston.

00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,220
-Right.
-You know?

00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:27,140
It's online, and so that
makes me question things.

00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,220
And to do this, it would
have to be an investment,

00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,120
not tuition, and it feels
more like tuition,

00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,220

I'm out.

Hi, Sharks.
My name's Tomer Alpert.

I'm from Telluride, Colorado,

00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:24,140
and I'm seeking $200,000
for 6% of our company, Felt.

00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,170
Think about how wonderful
it feels

00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:29,110
to receive a handwritten card
in the mail,

00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:32,100
knowing that your friend
picked the card just for you.

00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,180
And they took time
to handwrite you

00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:37,040
a personal, thoughtful message.

00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,250
-Hm.
-Great experience, right?

00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:42,170
Now think about sending the
card -- terrible experience.

00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:45,220
You have to drive to the store,
pick a card from a giant wall,

00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:49,120
drive home, write your message,
search for stamps,

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,270
and still have to trek out
to the mailbox.

00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:55,160
So it's no wonder we don't send
more handwritten cards.

00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,100
That's why we built Felt.

your handwritten card,
your photos --

get saved in the app...
-Yep.

00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:35,030
...and you can come back
to them and see them.

00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:37,100
You can also resend them and edit them

So, we don't do

but that's where
we're heading,

because what you can do in Felt

00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:52,110
is you can save every single
address you write.

00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,210
So, let's say you're a bride.
-Yeah.

00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:56,120
Brides do 75 thank-you cards,
on average,

00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,080
and they handwrite
every address.

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,060
Now in Felt,
you get saved addresses,

00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,030
so when you want
to do invitations

00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,080
or holiday cards next year,

00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,180
all your addresses
are handwritten.

00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,050
How long have you been
in the app store?

00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,110
Since May 2013.

00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,120
And how many downloads?

00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,030
Over 60,000, and we have
a 4.5-star rating

00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,080
across both of our apps.

00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,160
60,000 is nothing,
so that's why you're here.

00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,000
Right? That's not enough to
build and sustain a business.

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,170
And here's why.
So we started selling
a $4 greeting card,

00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:22,120
and we're scrappy
entrepreneurs.

00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,110
We invested all of our own cash
into this.

00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:26,070
So I've put in $100,000.

00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,070
And who's the "we" in this,
Tomer?

00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,110
There's four partners.

00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:30,060
Me, my wife, Gracie --
she does operations.

00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,100
The reason we're here today

00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,110
is 'cause we've identified
two huge markets

00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,160

brides and professionals.

00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,230

has the problem.

She or he has to has to send
75 thank-you cards.

00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,220
So what we want to do is plug in
with registries.

00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,130
Imagine if you go to Macy's
and you build your registry

00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,140
and you learn about Felt.

00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,020
And you're like, "Holy moly."

00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:50,090
I-I see what you're doing,
but that's just a one-off, right?

00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:52,240
No, no. A bride turns into
a holiday card,

00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,200
so next year,
she does holiday cards...
Eh...

00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,120
...and she does the birthday
cards and she does --

00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,030
I'm just telling you,
because my wife would be,

00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,080
"Are you kidding me?

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,100
You're not willing
to take the time

00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,190
to really
handwrite them?"

00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:06,110
The best tool for women --
guilt.
Yeah.

00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,180

as if you wrote it

on your dining-room table.

00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:11,140
-Tomer, there's a lot --
-And that's what customers
love about us.

00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,080
Tomer, isn't there a lot of
people that do this already?

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,200

00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:43,140
-But your premise is --
-Sorry.

00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,210
It's all nonsense,
Robert.

00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:46,200
It's all nonsense
across the board.

00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,090
Herjavec: Just --
I-I-I can't get around that.

00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:51,130
Like, I'm just --
I want to bite my nails,

00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:54,050
and for me to stop,
I have to hit this thing.

00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,120
Sure.

00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,110
Why can't Lori
buzz it for me?

00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:58,160
She can.
Um, she absolutely can.

00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,250
There's a remote control --

00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:02,150
There's a remote-control app.
There's automation.

00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:04,120
What percentage of the time
does it not work?

00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,110
It doesn't work if you don't
want it to work.

00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:08,020
So, it doesn't --
-Oh!

00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,437
Wow!
-Yeah, of course.

00:35:09,437 --> 00:35:11,190
So, if you use it on sugar,
after about three or four days

00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:13,140
on, like, a cookie
or tortilla chips,

00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,130
you'll start to notice
the flavor changes.

00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:16,220
Now, what's interesting
about it, in the first --

00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,130
You start to notice
the flavor changes?

00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:20,120
-Yeah, you do.
-You're such a con artist.

00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,150
I'm absolutely not.

00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,240
As for results, Mark,
more than 50% of our users

00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,140
break their habit in five day--
in seven days or less.

00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:28,100
First of all, you can't -- First
of all -- Okay, let me just --

00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,130
Let's leave the skepticism
for one minute.

00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,130
-No, no, no, no, no, no.
-I just want you to --

00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,170
I love the skepticism,

00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,250
'cause he doesn't know
what's about to come.

00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:34,110
Because it's all nonsense,
because you can't tell
anything in five days.

00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,210
You guys can argue
till the cows come home.

00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:37,160
You want to get a deal,
explain to me why you're
worth $14 million.

00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,210
-Sure $15 million.
-What is it? How much?

00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:41,100
Well, number one -- number one,
our sales are great.

00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,170
-What are your sales?!
-What are your sales?

00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:44,060
You didn't even
get to that.

00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,100
So, we're in pre-order,

00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,100
and we actually just began
shipping this week.

00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,140
We've sold $800,000 of revenue.

00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,050
Wait, wait -- preorders.

00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:51,060
3/4 of the users
were preorders,

00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,120
and 1/4 of the users
were prototypes.

00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:55,060
What did each of those people
pay for one device?

00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,060
$200.

00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,070
How much?

00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,060
$200.

00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,140
Who buys these?

00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,210
So, our biggest users
are sitting too long,

00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:07,150
waking up on time,
nail biting, and eating.

00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,200
So we've started to build out

00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,170
multiple really cool
integrations for this product.

00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,090
The first thing
is the alarm clock.

00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:13,180
It's the first alarm clock
that works.

00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,120
When you get a slight zap
in the morning,

00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,140
it actually knocks you awake
with a jolt of adrenaline.

00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,230
-Great way to start the day.
-[ Laughs ]

00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:20,180
Yeah. You'd be surprised.
The people love it.
Can't wait.

00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,270
How could you guys
be so gullible?

00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:23,190
-Read the evidence
if you're that --
-We're not being gullible.

00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,210
None of it's
<i>your</i> evidence!
We're asking questions.

00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:27,190
No one's disputing
aversion therapy.

00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,100
-Yeah. So, we're --
-Aversion therapy works.

00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,130
We're bringing aversion therapy
to consumers!

00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,220
You're using other
people's studies...

00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,110
But, so, there's nothing
that's actually happening...

00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,200
Mark, we know you're the
smartest guy in the room...

00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,100
...besides the...
It's not about being the
smartest guy in the room!

00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,110
You can't be that stupid,
Robert,

00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,130
to even think there's
any legitimacy.

00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,050
-Enough. Calm down.
-Can I just listen to him?

00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:40,727
Geez.

00:36:40,727 --> 00:36:42,170
Ugh. Gosh, you guys
are making me so ADD.

00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:44,050
All right,
let me talk about the...

00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:45,049
Oh, <i>we</i> make you ADD?

00:36:45,049 --> 00:36:46,070
Maneesh: You guys make it
happen. All right.

00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,100
Maneesh,
you're a strange dude.

00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,210
-[ Laughs ]
-Yeah.

00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:50,200
Some of the cool stuff
we're doing that Mr. Cuban
would like is this --

00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,040
We've started integrating
with --
I don't think Mark's
gonna like anything.

00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,090
Herjavec: Yeah.

00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,120
Aversion therapy is legit,

00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,080
but what's not legit
is trying to take credit

00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,200
for other studies and apply it
to your product.

00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,120
You're kidding.
I gave you an evidence booklet

00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,150
with all
the citations, sir.

00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,260
Greiner:
These are your studies?

00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,160
You've got a booklet
that has -- None of those
studies are yours!

00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,200
They're just related
to aversion therapy.

00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,090
No, no, no, no.
These are studies we -- we --

00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,100
These are
aversion therapy studies.

00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,160
Aversion therapy studies,
so -- Okay.

00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,220
Outside your realm.
Not necessarily --
Oh, well, you know what?

00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,160
That's -- That's the strongest
point here...

00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,220
O'Leary:
Hang on. Mark...

00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:16,170
...is that this isn't based on
anything that you've done.

00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:18,110
-Right!
-Are you negotiating, or --

00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,080
Okay, so we have had
600 users.

00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,170
So, where are <i>your</i> studies?

00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:23,130
Over half of them quit their
addiction in five days --

00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:24,230
seven days or less.

00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:26,160
Well, wait. But you don't
have any proof that it
changes your taste buds.

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,070
Yes, we do. We do.
We have users. We have evidence.

00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,130
You don't have any testing.

00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:30,200
More than half of
our users quit --

00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,240
More than 81% of our users quit
nail biting in four days.

00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,160
Where is your proof of this?
What study do you have?

00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,110
You should be doing
clinical trials.

00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,110
-Sure. I'd love to.
-Right?

00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,110
-They're expensive.
-So, we began --

00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,130
Why don't you have
clinical trials?

00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:43,050
All right,
I'm gonna make it simple.

00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,090
I talk about things.

00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:46,140
I say things are either heroes
or zeroes.

00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,100
For me, this is
a nowhere-near-o.

00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,230
I'm out.

00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:55,180
I find your presentation is
exhausting and complicated,

00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:59,110
and I couldn't imagine having
the energy to deal with that.

00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,110
This doesn't sound
very positive, Barbara.

00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:04,060
I'm out.

00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,260
Okay, Lori and Barbara
are history.

00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,170
I'd like to talk a little bit
about our numbers this year.

00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:12,010
Let me --
Let me just finish.

00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:12,532
Sure.

00:38:12,532 --> 00:38:14,110
When you first came out,
I really liked it.

00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:16,140
It's habit.
Habit creates discipline,

00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:19,170
discipline creates more habit,
and that's how you get success.

00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:24,150
What I don't like about is you
have a $16 million valuation

00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:27,280
on preorders --
It's too much.

00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,130
I'm out.

00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:30,050
So, I understand
absolutely, Robert.

00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,080
Thank you very much.

00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,180
Look, if you had
verifiable proof

00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,180
that all your
aversion therapy...
Mm-hmm.

00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:38,150
...can be well-executed
with your device,

00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:41,190
you wouldn't need to import
other people's studies,

00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:43,180
because with all this
advance money you got,

00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,180
you could've gone to any
university and said,

00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,160
"You know what?
We don't want to rush it.

00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,150
We want to get our own
verifiable studies in place

00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:52,150
so that no one
can question us."

00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:55,190
The one thing that kills
tech products is hyperbole...
Mm-hmm.

00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:57,220
...because at some point
you have to execute.

00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:00,020
You violated that one.
-Let me speak. Listen.

00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,020
Now your turn to listen.

00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,140
If you would've just said,
"You know what?

00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,230
This is a reminder,
and everybody is different,

00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:09,100
so we have different ways
to remind you."
Bam.

00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:12,080
Right? But you went so
over-the-top with nonsense,

00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,080
it is everything but
a legitimate product,

00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,250
and for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,230
Let me tell you --
Let me come back to medical,

00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:23,140
'cause I really want to answer
Lori's question.

00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:25,070
Maneesh, all of these
Sharks are out.

00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,170
They're all out.
-Kevin's left.

00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:28,090
They're all out, okay?
There is a medical component
to this, but I --

00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:29,130
Shock yourself
for a minute.

00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:32,090
You're a combination of
spontaneous combustion

to listen to you.
-Yeah.

Luckily for you, I got
my undergrad in psychology.

00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,150
To make money, I worked
on a rhesus study

00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:43,230
that used the same technology
as you to modify behavior.

the truth here.

00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,140
is that we're not focused
on the money.

00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,120
We're focused more on the habits
we're changing.

00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,140
Not focused on the money?

00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,140
You've come to the wrong place,
my friend.

00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,160
Cuban:
You're focused more on the what?

00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,100
-I'm here to make money.
-Let him finish, Kev.

00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,130
Maneesh: Our biggest thing --
Our biggest goal

00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,180
is to break bad habits
around the world,

00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:08,290
and, Mr. Wonderful, I just --
I can't work with you.

00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:09,160
Why not?

00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,160
I'm just worried that if
we work together --

00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,040
He doesn't --
You don't like him.

00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,110
I do like him as a person,

00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,140
but I feel like, as an investor
in the company,

00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,200
it would be really bad.

00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,200
Greiner:
Maneesh, you didn't want
an offer here today.

00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,270
Did you really?
-I absolutely want an offer.

00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:20,230
I absolutely want an offer.
-You just came in for exposure?

00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,150
Okay, you got one, and why don't
you want the structure of
that offer? Why not?

00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,100
It's the [sighs] The structure's
actually quite good.

00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,060
Uh...
-It's the person.

00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,130
It's the person.

00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:29,070
I feel like...

00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:33,100

Maneesh, you're an [bleep]

Get the [bleep] out of here.

Oh!

00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:43,150

See ya.

All right, Sharks.
Thank you very much.

00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,210
I had a tinge of regret

00:41:58,210 --> 00:42:00,180
for rejecting the deal
with Mr. Wonderful,

00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:03,070
but the truth is our company
is building something

00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:04,100
much bigger than just money.

00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,190
We're trying to change
human behavior,

00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:08,100
and Kevin wouldn't be the right
partner for us to work with.

00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,090
I'm telling you,
whether it was you

00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:12,040
or me or Robert
or one of us,

00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,080
he was gonna do that
to somebody.

00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,160
It just happened to be
you were the last guy.

00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,200
-Because it's talk.
-I realize he's a gold digger.

00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,060
He's an idiot!
He's a con artist.

00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:19,170
This technology has promise.

00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:21,090
No, he thinks he's sincere.

00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:22,130
It's not a technology, Kevin!
He's a con artist.

00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:23,190
-Has problems or promise?
-Kevin, don't feel bad.

00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:25,250
-I don't feel bad.
-Don't feel bad.
