WHY DID I
COME UP WITH THIS?

00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,800
BECAUSE I HAD A FAT MIRROR,

00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,370
AND I HAD NO IDEA IT WAS ADDING
10 POUNDS TO MY REFLECTION.

00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:47,673

BODY INSECURITIES.

I'VE NEVER REALLY HAD
BODY ISSUES BEFORE.

00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:57,550
AND SO, ONE DAY, MY FRIEND
CAME OVER, AND SHE SAID,

00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:00,653
"THAT MIRROR ADDS 10 POUNDS,"
AND THE LIGHT WENT OFF.

00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:04,490
HOW COULD THIS MIRROR AFFECT
HOW I FEEL ABOUT MY BODY

00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,525

A HEALTH ADVOCATE?

I THINK THAT IT'S DANGEROUS.
IT IS.

00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:16,869
BECAUSE I THINK
THAT PEOPLE ARE TRYING

00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:21,707
TO ALWAYS NOT BE WHO THEY ARE
AND LIVE AN UNHEALTHY LIFESTYLE,

00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,242

BUT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN BEING IN A RETAIL PLACE

00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:43,295
AND HAVING A MIRROR THAT,
IN KEVIN'S WORDS, DECEIVES YOU

00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:44,730
INTO THINKING
THAT YOU LOOK BETTER,

00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,532

YOU MAKE A PURCHASE.
