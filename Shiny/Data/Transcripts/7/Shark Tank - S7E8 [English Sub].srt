HOW IT WORKS.

00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,295
UNSHRINKIT WORKS
IN FOUR SIMPLE STEPS.

00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:26,132
STEP ONE -- ADD UNSHRINKIT
TO A GALLON OF WATER.

00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:29,536
STEP TWO --
ADD YOUR SWEATERS

00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:31,604

FOR 30 MINUTES.

UNSHRINKIT IS COLOR SAFE

00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:43,383
THE FOURTH AND FINAL STEP
IS THAT YOU RE-SHAPE

TO THE DESIRED SIZE,

00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:47,587

THAT WERE READY FOR US

00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:31,477
AS EARLY AS SEPTEMBER,
BUT WE WEREN'T READY FOR THAT.

00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,212
WHAT KIND OF RETAILERS
WERE READY FOR YOU?

AT JO-ANN FABRICS,

LOOKING AT J.C. PENNEY --
LOOKING AT?

00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:41,621
ARE YOU LOOKING AT THEM
OR ARE THEY LOOKING AT YOU?
IT'S A COMBINATION OF BOTH.

00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,723
SO WHEN WE LAUNCHED, WE ACTUALLY
HAD A LOT OF OUTREACH

00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:45,825
FROM RETAILERS, AND WE SAID,
"LOOK, WE'RE NOT READY YET.

00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,995
WE DON'T HAVE THE INVENTORY."
Herjavec: ALL RIGHT,
SO HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?

00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,130
SO, WE RETAIL $12 TO $15.

00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,666
-WHOA.
-WE MAKE IT FOR ABOUT $1.

00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,802
WHY ARE YOU SELLING IT
FOR $12 TO $15?

00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:57,603

SO, WHEN WE FIRST LAUNCHED,
WE WERE ACTUALLY SELLING IT

00:13:57,603 --> 00:14:00,440
FOR $9.99,
AND WE THOUGHT THAT WAS FAIR

00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,175
GIVEN THAT THE AVERAGE RANGE
OF PRICE

00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,309
ON THE LAUNDRY AISLE
WAS ANYWHERE

00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,478
FROM ABOUT $4 TO ABOUT $12.

00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:07,547
SO, THEN WE STARTED
TO GET FEEDBACK FROM PEOPLE,

00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:09,215
AND THEY WOULD SAY,
"OH, MY GOSH,

00:21:55,447 --> 00:22:00,052
I'M SEEKING $85,000 IN EXCHANGE
FOR 20% OF MY COMPANY.

00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:00,653
NOW, SHARKS, I KNOW DIRT.

00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,688
WHETHER I'M OUT COMPETING
ON MY MOTORCYCLE

00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:04,623
IN THE X GAMES,
TRYING TO WIN MORE MEDALS

00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,292
TO ADD MORE MEDALS TO ADD
TO MY COLLECTION,

00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:08,527
OR WHETHER I'M IN THE GARAGE
WORKING ON MY MOTORCYCLE,

00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,529
I'M ALWAYS AROUND DIRT,
GREASE, AND GRIME.

00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,731
AND THROUGHOUT THE YEARS,
THERE'S NEVER BEEN A SAFE

00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:15,434
AND EFFECTIVE PRODUCT
TO THOROUGHLY CLEANSE MY HANDS.

00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,536
SO, I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION

00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:20,372
THAT IT'S GONNA TAKE DIRT
TO FIGHT DIRT.

00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:21,473
YES, THAT'S RIGHT --

00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:25,144
DIRT JUST LIKE THE KIND
YOU WOULD FIND OUTSIDE.

00:22:25,144 --> 00:22:26,412
SO, YOU'RE PROBABLY
ASKING YOURSELF

00:22:26,412 --> 00:22:28,013
WHY WOULD YOU PUT DIRT IN SOAP?

00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:28,681
SOUNDS KIND OF CRAZY.

00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:31,450
TURNS OUT THAT DIRT
IS ACTUALLY THE BEST SUBSTANCE

00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,618
IN THE ENTIRE WORLD

00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:36,055
AT ABSORBING GREASE, OILS,
CHEMICALS, AND TOXINS.

00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:36,689
BUT ON TOP OF THAT,

00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:39,258
IT REALLY ACTS AS AN EXFOLIANT
TOWARDS YOUR SKIN.

00:22:39,258 --> 00:22:40,593
SO, WHERE GREASE WOULD NORMALLY

00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:43,195
REMAIN DEEP IN THE PORES
OF YOUR HANDS,

00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,530
IT'S ABLE TO REALLY GO IN THERE,

00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,333
LATCH AND HOLD ON
TO THAT GREASE AND RINSE CLEAN.

00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:50,436
GRIP CLEAN IS PERFECT
FOR AUTOMOTIVE MECHANICS,

00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:53,339
CONSTRUCTION WORKERS,
FARMERS, LANDSCAPERS,

00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:56,275
OR SIMPLY ANYBODY WHO GETS DIRTY
AND NEEDS TO GET CLEAN.

00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:59,111
SO, I CREATED THIS IN MY GARAGE,
AND SEVERAL MONTHS LATER,

00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:01,247
AND TWO VERY CLEAN HANDS LATER,

00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:03,349
I FEEL MY PRODUCT IS UNIQUE
AND A WINNER.

00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:06,185
SO, SHARKS,
WHO WANTS TO GET CLEAN

00:23:06,185 --> 00:23:08,220
BY GETTING DIRTY
WITH GRIP CLEAN?

00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,555
BRYCE,
YOU WENT TO THE X GAMES?

00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,690
I DID, YES, I HAVE --
WHAT DID YOU WIN?
ARE THOSE MEDALS?

00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:15,127
YEAH, OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS,
I'VE ACQUIRED THREE MEDALS.

00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:16,262
AND WHAT EVENT
ARE YOU IN?

00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:17,463
STEP UP -- MOTOCROSS HIGH JUMP,

00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:19,231
BASICALLY POLE VAULTING
ON A MOTORCYCLE.

00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,366
-YOU'RE THE REAL DEAL, HUH?
-WOW.

00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:21,600
-REAL DEAL.
-YOU EVER HURT YOURSELF BAD?

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,203
YEAH, THAT'S KIND OF WHY I'M
TRYING TO START A COMPANY HERE.

00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:26,171
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:28,274
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN YOU

00:23:28,274 --> 00:23:29,742
AND, LIKE,
A LAVA OR A GOOP?

00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:32,244
VERY GOOD QUESTION.
IS IT JUST
THE ALL-NATURAL ELEMENT?

00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,379
YES,
THE ALL-NATURAL ASPECT.

00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:35,514
MOST MECHANICS ARE WASHING
MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY.

00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:37,349
THEIR HANDS WILL BREAK OUT
IN A RASH.

00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,351
SO, WHEN YOU'RE WORKING
WITH CHEMICALS ALL DAY,

00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:40,519
THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO USE

00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,354
IS ANOTHER
CHEMICALLY INFUSED SOAP

00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:44,223
TO TAKE THOSE CHEMICALS OFF.

00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:45,424
THE DIRT THAT'S ACTUALLY
IN THERE,

00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,493
IT'S ALL COSMETIC-GRADE CLAY.
-OKAY, WHAT ELSE IS IN IT?

00:23:47,493 --> 00:23:51,363
SO, IT'S A COCONUT OIL
AND OLIVE OIL BASED HAND SOAP.

00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:53,265
AND THEN YOU ADD THE CLAY
TO BE THE EXFOLIANT

00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,500
TO HELP GET ALL THE GREASE.
-CORRECT.

00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,435
-CAN I TRY IT?
-I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO TRY IT.

00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,004
I CAME A LONG WAY, SO I'D LOVE
FOR YOU TO TRY IT.
IS THIS DIRT?

00:23:59,004 --> 00:23:59,538
YES, IT IS.

00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:01,240
-"IS THIS DIRT?"
-IS THIS DIRT?

00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,274
WELL, IS THIS YOUR DIRT?

00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,442
IS THIS WHAT'S --
IS THAT WHAT'S IN IT?

00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,444
THAT IS THE EXACT STUFF
THAT I PUT IN IT.

00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,246
JUST USE IT
AS YOU WOULD A REGULAR SOAP.

00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:08,347
WATER ACTIVATED.

00:24:08,347 --> 00:24:10,449
SO, I LIKE TO SCRUB IT
ON MY HANDS QUITE A BIT.

00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,418
-OH, IT'S REALLY THICK.
-YEAH, IT IS.

00:24:12,418 --> 00:24:14,186
'CAUSE ANOTHER COMPLAINT
THAT I HAD

00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:15,354
WITH A LOT OF THE OTHER SOAPS

00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:17,323
IS THEY WERE REALLY ABRASIVE,
SO IF YOU WERE USING IT

00:24:17,323 --> 00:24:20,225
MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY,
IT'D REALLY EAT YOUR HANDS UP.

00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:21,360
-SO I TRIED TO MAKE --
-OH, WOW.

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,429
-IT TRULY WORKS, AND --
-OH, MY GOSH.

00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:26,131
HONESTLY, SURPRISINGLY,
IT'S REALLY GOOD.

00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,232
THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE THAT.

00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:29,401
DID YOU GET ANY RETAIL
DISTRIBUTION ON THIS?

00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,203
I HAVEN'T.
I'M A PRE-REVENUE COMPANY.

00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:33,205
DO YOU HAVE ANY DISTRIBUTION
CHANNELS SET UP NOW?

00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:35,207
YES, I HAVE ABOUT
FIVE LOCAL MOTORCYCLE SHOPS

00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:36,542
THAT ARE READY
TO SELL IT RIGHT NOW.

00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:38,210
WHAT PRICE POINT
ARE YOU GONNA SELL IT AT?

00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,378
WHAT -- WHAT DOES IT
COST YOU TO MAKE IT?

00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:41,280
COSTS ME $2.12 TO MAKE

00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,715
THE BOTTLE, PACKAGE,
DONE, EVERYTHING.

00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:46,618
WHOLESALE IT AT $5,
RETAIL AT STORES FOR $8.99.

00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:47,720
AND WHAT'S YOUR
COMPETITOR SELL FOR?

00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,522
COMPETITORS RETAIL
FROM ANYWHERE FROM $5 TO $8

00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:51,790
DEPENDING ON WHERE
THEY'RE SELLING.

00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,625
SO, THIS IS EXPENSIVE
FOR YOU TO MAKE.
IT IS. YES, IT IS.

00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,527
THE MORE I CAN PRODUCE
OF THIS, OBVIOUSLY,

00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:57,396
MY MARGINS ARE GONNA BE
BETTER AND BETTER.

00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:58,630
RIGHT, HOW LOW
CAN YOU GET THE COST?

00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,100
I FEEL THAT ANYTHING
OVER 5,000 UNITS,

00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,501
I CAN GET IT DOWN TO $1.80,

00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,370
AND THEN PUSHING
ANYTHING OVER 10,000,

00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,505
I FEEL I CAN GET IT DOWN
TO $1.25.

00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,274
SO, 10,000 UNITS,
YOUR WHOLESALE IS 5 BUCKS.

00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:11,310
-MM-HMM.
-THAT'S ONLY $50,000 IN SALES.

00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,445
-MM-HMM.
-THAT'S NOT A BUSINESS.

00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:15,447
IF YOU PLANNED OUT A WAY
THAT YOU CAN GET

00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:18,617
TO 100,000 UNITS
IN SALES PER YEAR,

00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:21,487
AND THEN WHAT WOULD
YOUR COSTS BE?

00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:23,489
[ EXHALES SHARPLY ]
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:24,590
YES, I HAVE PLANNED IT OUT.

00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,392
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY,
I WANT TO MAKE

00:25:26,392 --> 00:25:28,293
MORE BOTTLES UP
TO THE $100,000 RANGE.

00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:30,195
BUT YOU GOT
TO KNOW THE NUMBERS.

00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,297
TO BREAK A DOLLAR
FOR COST OF GOODS,

00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,233
HOW MANY UNITS
DO YOU HAVE TO ORDER?

00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:36,402
I WOULD HAVE
TO ORDER 20,000 UNITS.

00:25:36,402 --> 00:25:37,536
-20,000 UNITS.
-THAT'S IT?

00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,670
-YES.
-TO GET UNDER A DOLLAR.

00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,639
YES.
Herjavec: BRYCE,
IN SEASON ONE, BARBARA AND I

00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:42,608
DID A DEAL WITH A PRODUCT
CALLED GREASE MONKEY.

00:25:42,608 --> 00:25:44,343
-YEAH, I'M FAMILIAR WITH IT.
-I REMEMBER THAT.

00:25:44,343 --> 00:25:46,311
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU REMEMBER THAT.
I REMEMBER WATCHING THAT.

00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,080
AND WHAT IT WAS -- IT WAS
A VERY NATURAL PRODUCT

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,114
THAT CLEANED OIL.

00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:50,315
-WORKED GREAT.
-MM-HMM.

00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:52,551
I THOUGHT PEOPLE WOULD LOOK
AT THIS IN STORES AND SAY,

00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,320
"OH, MY GOSH, HERE'S A CHEMICAL
ONE, HERE'S A NATURAL ONE.

00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,356
LET ME BUY THE NATURAL."

00:25:57,356 --> 00:26:01,126
BUT WE FOUND THAT CONSUMERS
DIDN'T CARE ENOUGH.

00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:02,394
-HMM.
-YOU KNOW, LISTEN.

00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,430
YOU KNOW, TO GO OUT THERE
AND WIN THOSE AWARDS,

00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,631
I'M SURE THAT YOU ARE
SOUGHT AFTER

00:26:05,631 --> 00:26:07,332
IN YOUR MARKET
FOR VARIOUS THINGS.

00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:09,501
YOU MAY HAVE
A GREAT MACHINE BEHIND YOU.

00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:12,271
I MEAN, YOU COULD BE TONY HAWK
OF THIS AREA.

00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:13,705
I REALLY WANT TO TARGET
THE MOTORCYCLE INDUSTRY

00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:16,308
IN A SENSE BECAUSE I HAVE
A CREDIBLE NAME IN THAT ASPECT.

00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,377
-ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY.
-AS YOU SHOULD.

00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:20,345
SO, IF YOU'RE GOOD AT SOMETHING,
GO FULL FORCE WITH THAT.

00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:22,247
YEP, YEAH.
SO, I HAVE A TEAM
OF FRIENDS BEHIND ME.

00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,682
ARE YOU MAKING IT -- ARE YOU
MANUFACTURING IT AT HOME?

00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:25,484
ARE YOU DOMESTICALLY --
YES, OUT OF MY GARAGE
RIGHT NOW.

00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:27,486
OUT OF YOUR GARAGE?
YEAH, THAT'S THE PROBLEM
IS I'M MAKING IT

00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:28,720
OUT OF A FIVE-GALLON BUCKET
RIGHT NOW.

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,256
-YOU REALLY ARE?
-I TRULY AM, AND THAT'S WHY --

00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,357
THAT'S AWESOME.
GOOD FOR YOU, BABY.

00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:33,525
I MEAN, I CAN'T SELL IT
TO THE BIGGER SHOPS

00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:35,527
BECAUSE IT'LL TAKE ME
10 YEARS TO MAKE 100 BOTTLES.

00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,696
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING ELSE.
HAVE YOU TRIED SOCIAL MEDIA?

00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,798
IT'S NOT REALLY WORKING OUT,
AND I'LL EXPLAIN WHY.

00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:42,301
IT'S BECAUSE NO ONE REALLY WANTS
TO BUY THIS PRODUCT ONLINE.

00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:43,635
THEY WANT TO GO
TO HOME DEPOT...

00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:45,671
THAT'S TRUE.
...WHEN THEY'RE BUYING ALL
THEIR SUPPLIES AND EVERYTHING.

00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:47,473
-THEY WANT IT FASTER.
-YEAH, THEY WANT IT NOW.

00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:49,341
LOOK, I ADMIRE ANYBODY
WHO'S AN ATHLETE.

00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:51,643
I MEAN, IT TAKES AN INCREDIBLE
AMOUNT OF DISCIPLINE TO DO THIS.

00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:53,579
I CAN SENSE
YOU'RE GOING OUT HERE, ROBERT.

00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:56,482
WELL, I'VE BEEN DOWN
THIS ROAD WITH GREASE MONKEY,

00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:58,717
AND WHAT I LEARNED OUT OF IT IS,
YOU KNOW, AS MARK ALWAYS SAYS,

00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:02,387
IT'S A HARD WAY TO GRIND
YOUR WAY TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY.

00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:03,622
AND MAYBE I KNOW TOO MUCH.

00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,524
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY WHY
DID YOU GET IN YOUR BUSINESS?

00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:06,758
I'M LIKE I'M GLAD
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I KNOW NOW...

00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:08,527
RIGHT.
...'CAUSE I WOULD'VE
NEVER GOT INTO IT.

00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:11,230
IN THIS CASE,
MAYBE I KNOW TOO MUCH.

00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,298
I'M -- I'M OUT.

00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,433
STILL FOUR SHARKS LEFT.
-GOT IT.

00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:16,335
I RESPECT THAT.
-YEAH.

00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:18,303
BRYCE, LOOK, YOU'RE DOING
A LOT OF GREAT THINGS,

00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,239
BUT YOU'RE NOT
A COMPANY YET.

00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:22,608
Y-YOU'VE GOT THE DESIRE,
YOU'VE GOT THE EFFORT,

00:27:22,608 --> 00:27:24,610
BUT YOU -- YOU DON'T HAVE
THE REST OF IT, RIGHT?

00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:26,578
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW
TO MAKE IT A BUSINESS YET,

00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:28,647
AND THAT'S WHAT
YOU'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT.
YEAH.

00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,517
I --
YEAH, IT'S A BUMMER
'CAUSE I KNEW COMING INTO THIS,

00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:34,219
I WAS AT A BIG DISADVANTAGE
BEING A PREMATURE COMPANY,

00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:35,521
BUT I DIDN'T WANT
TO HIDE THE FACT,

00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:37,523
DIDN'T TRY TO MAKE IT
ALL GLITZ AND GLAMOUR --

00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:38,624
THAT I'M SOMETHING BIGGER
THAN I'M NOT.

00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,359
I JUST THINK IT'S GONNA BE
TOO MUCH WORK

00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:43,295
FROM OUR POST RELATIVE
TO THE UPSIDE,

00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:45,697
SO UNFORTUNATELY,
FOR THOSE REASONS, I'M OUT.

00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:50,736
I UNDERSTAND.
THANK YOU.

00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:54,439

00:35:32,364 --> 00:35:34,766
TELL US WHY
YOU RAMPED UP LIKE THAT.

00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:38,603
WHAT WE DO WITH THOSE PROFITS
IS WE RE-INVEST IN R&amp;D

00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:42,407
AND MAKING OTHER ACCESSORIES
THAT OTHER PEOPLE AREN'T DOING.

00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:44,709
I MEAN, WE'RE YOUNG,
WE'RE INNOVATIVE.

00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:47,545
BY THE TIME SOMEBODY COMES IN
AND COPIES ONE OF OUR PRODUCTS,

00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:49,581
WE'VE TAKEN PROFITS
AND MADE THREE OTHER ONES

00:35:49,581 --> 00:35:51,216
AND KEEP IT GOING.
YOU'RE ALWAYS AHEAD
OF THE TREND.

00:35:51,216 --> 00:35:53,151
-EXACTLY.
-AND, JEFF, ARE YOU A DESIGNER?

00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,285
WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND?

00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:57,222
SO, I'M AN ENTREPRENEUR
AT HEART.

00:35:57,222 --> 00:35:58,657
WHEN I WAS 15 YEARS OLD,

00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:02,527
I STARTED MY FIRST COMPANY --
WE GOT CRABS.

00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:06,364
I WAS IN A FISH STORE AND I SAW

00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:09,434
THAT THEY WERE SELLING
HERMIT CRABS FOR $4 EACH.

00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:12,370
AND I WAS LIKE, "THESE CRABS
ARE DOWN AT THE BEACH.

00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,505
LIKE,
THERE'S THOUSANDS OF THEM."

00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:16,408
SO I WENT DOWN TO THE BEACH
WITH MY BUCKET,

00:36:16,408 --> 00:36:19,177
THREW -- THREW A BUNCH OF CRABS
IN THE BUCKET,

00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,612
AND STARTED SELLING
THEM ONLINE.

00:36:20,612 --> 00:36:22,280
BUT WHEN WAS THAT?
HOW LONG AGO WAS THAT?
NO, WHEN?

00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,481
THAT WAS 15, SO I'M 26 NOW.

00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:26,217
SO, IT WAS ABOUT 11 YEARS AGO.
-OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:27,619
SO, HOW DID YOU
START THIS BUSINESS?

00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:30,221
YEAH, SO THIS BUSINESS
WAS STARTED

00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:32,257
WHEN I WAS
AT U.C. SANTA BARBARA.

00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:33,591
I WAS ON THE SKI TEAM,

00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:37,328
AND WE WERE FILMING A TON
ON THE SNOW WITH THESE CAMERAS,

00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:39,497
AND I WAS LIKE,
"WHY DON'T MY VIDEOS LOOK

00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:42,267
LIKE ALL THESE
PRODUCTION SKI MOVIES?"

00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:44,502
SO I WENT ONLINE,
DID A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH,

00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:47,072
AND SAW THAT
ALL THESE GUYS' PRODUCTION

00:36:47,072 --> 00:36:48,406
ARE USING POLARIZER FILTERS.

00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:49,674
SO I WAS LIKE,
"OH, THAT'S COOL."

00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:52,110
SO I WAS LIKE, "ALL RIGHT,
I'LL JUST BUY A DSLR1."

00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,611
BOUGHT IT, DUCT TAPED IT
ONTO THE CAMERA,

00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:56,181
WENT OUT THERE, AND I WAS LIKE,
"OH, MY GOD!"

00:36:56,181 --> 00:36:58,283
LIKE, THIS MAKES
A HUGE DIFFERENCE.

00:36:58,283 --> 00:37:01,286
AND WAS LIKE, "HEY, I BET PEOPLE
WOULD PAY FOR THESE."

00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:02,721
-WOW.
-SO I WENT HOME,

00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:04,456
LEARNED HOW TO BUILD
THE WEBSITE, BUILT IT,

00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:07,459
LEARNED HOW TO DO SOME S.E.O.,
OPTIMIZED IT, AND...

00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:09,427
-AND HERE YOU ARE. BOOM.
-...STARTED POLAR PRO.

00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:13,364
HOW MUCH OF YOUR OWN MONEY'S
IN HERE, OR ARE THERE INVESTORS?

00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:17,535
I USED $2,000
OF MY STUDENT LOAN MONEY, SO...

00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:21,539
GOT IT.
...INSTEAD OF BUYING
TEXTBOOKS AND FOOD,

00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:24,375
PRETTY MUCH, I USED IT
TO START THE COMPANY.

00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:26,177
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I DID
WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL.

00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:27,245
GOOD FOR YOU.
DO YOU HAVE DEBT?

00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,546
NO,
WE DON'T HAVE ANY DEBT.

00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:30,582
WHAT'S THE PROFIT
ON THE $5.6 MILLION?

00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:34,319
SO, PROFIT THIS YEAR
WILL PROBABLY END UP
AT ABOUT $300,000.

00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:36,488
-OH.
-BUT YOU GOT TO KEEP IN MIND

00:37:36,488 --> 00:37:39,190
I'M NOT TRYING TO SKIM
PROFIT OFF THE TABLE.

00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,893
I'M REINVESTING IN R&amp;D RIGHT NOW

00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:44,429
TRYING TO TAKE THIS THING
AS BIG AS POSSIBLE.
WAIT, WAIT, OKAY.

00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:45,663
BUT JEFF, WHERE DOES --
IT DOESN'T ADD UP.

00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:47,332
YEAH, 'CAUSE YOU'VE GOT
ALL THIS MARGIN.

00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:48,533
YOU SHOULD BE MAKING
A MILLION DOLLARS PLUS.

00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:49,701
-HE HAS A LOT OF PRODUCT.
-RIGHT.

00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:52,270
-HOW MUCH DO YOU SPEND ON R&amp;D?
-OVER A MILLION DOLLARS.

00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,271
-WOW.
-OH, WOW.

00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,339
-WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
-WOW.

00:37:54,339 --> 00:37:56,474
THAT'S LITERALLY TOOLING
AND PRODUCT DESIGN.

00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:58,510
BECAUSE ACCESSORIES
ARE CONSTANTLY CHANGING.
SO, I LOOK AT IT THIS WAY.

00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,445
THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN WHAT YOU'RE DOING

00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,180
AND WHAT'S OCCURRING
IN LET'S SAY

00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:05,049
THE ACCESSORIES MARKET
AROUND SMARTPHONES.

00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:06,451
-RIGHT.
-APPLE, ANDROID.

00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:09,354
AND SO THE GUYS THAT ARE WINNING
THAT HAVE HUGE SCALE.

00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:10,555
THEY HAVE A CONSTANT FLOW

00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:12,657
OF NEW OFFERINGS GOING
TO RETAIL STORES.

00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:14,592
AND OVER TIME,
THEIR MARGINS HAVE DECREASED

00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:16,427
BECAUSE THERE'S TONS
OF COMPETITION.

00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:18,296
I THINK THE SAME THING'S
GONNA HAPPEN TO YOU.

00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,265
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH RUNNING WITH THE WOLVES.

00:38:20,265 --> 00:38:21,466
I MEAN,
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:24,235

I'M HERE TODAY

YEAH, BUT I DON'T KNOW --

ALWAYS GET CRUSHED.

00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:34,479
